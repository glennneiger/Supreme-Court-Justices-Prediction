mr.
clarence
l.
thacker
if
it
please
the
court.
i
might
say
that
at
the
outset
here
that
if
ludenia
howard,
a
citizen
of
the
state
of
florida
had
known
that
she
was
to
be
charged
on
a
game
or
on
a
fish
violation
case
and
that
then
mind
of
the
united
states
governor
--
governor
would
put
her
in
this
supreme
court
prior
to
a
time
that
her
innocence
whereas
was
still
presumed
to
be
there
and
before
she
had
been
convicted,
i
dare
say
gentlemen,
that
she
would
have
been
much
better
off
had
she
been
not
guilty
but
plead
guilty
in
the
lower
court.
and
i
say
that
advisedly
and
very
sincerely,
and
i
say
it
for
this
reason,
that
all
of
us
know
that
more
and
more
today
that
administrative
agencies
and
commissioners
are
governing
our
very
lives
and
it's
very
important
that
when
we
consider
the
rules
and
regulations
that
are
made
with
these
agencies
and
the
statutes
that
are
passed
by
the
congress
in
a
criminal
nature
that
our
individual
citizens
do
not
--
do
not
--
not
--
do
not
lose
their
liberty
through
actions
of
these
boards
and
commissions
to
an
insidious
process.
now,
i
want
to
change
my
argument
a
little
bit
today
from
what
i
have
planned
to
do
by
virtue
of
certain
of
the
questions
that
came
up
here.
we
don't
contend
in
any
respect
that
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
game
and
fish
commission
of
florida
are
not
enforceable
in
florida
if
they
were
within
the
scope
of
the
constitutional
amendment
was
created.
but
we
do
say,
and
very
sincere
to
this
court,
that
even
though
that
rule
is
enforceable
in
florida,
it
was
not
within
the
contemplation
of
the
black
bass
act
which
was
passed
in
1926
that
those
rules
and
regulations
should
be
the
law
of
florida.
and
i
think
one
reason
is
very
obvious
on
the
face
of
it
and
that
is
in
1926,
when
that
black
bass
act
was
passed
which
prohibited
the
transportation
of
black
bass
within
the
states
or
without
the
states,
if
it
was
against
the
law
of
that
state,
that
the
constitutional
amendment
creating
the
game
and
fish
--
fresh
water
fish
commission
in
florida
did
not
come
into
being
until
some
20
years
later,
almost
20
years
later.
so,
i
think
it's
observed
on
the
face
of
it
to
say
that
congress
meant
at
that
time
that
the
law
of
authority
was
going
to
apply
to
the
rules
and
regulations
that
came
into
effect
in
the
state
of
florida
almost
20
years
later.
mr.
clarence
l.
thacker
no,
sir,
it
was
not
restrictive.
mr.
clarence
l.
thacker
no,
sir,
it
was
not
--
mr.
clarence
l.
thacker
i
think
it
has
general
--
general
application.
mr.
clarence
l.
thacker
that
may
be
true,
sir,
here
and
that
--
that's
--
the
government
take
some
solace
in
this
position,
your
honor.
and
that
is
they
say
that
that
black
bass
act
has
been
amended
twice,
since
its
inception
in
1926
for
the
very
fact
that
when
that
act
was
--
was
amended
that
the
congress
did
not
change
the
wording
with
respect
to
the
law
of
the
state
is
the
best
evidence
that
the
congress
did
not
even
consider
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
commission.
and
the
only
amendments
that
took
part
in
that
--
in
that
black
bass
act
was
to
name
different
types
of
fish
other
than
black
bass
upon
which
it's
illegal
to
transport
back
and
forth.we
seriously
contend,
your
honors,
that
the
main
difference
that
the
government
and
ludenia
howard
in
this
case
is
the
fact
that
the
government
refused
to
believe
that
this
is
a
criminal
statute
and
it
affects
the
liberty
of
our
citizens.
and
add
as
a
criminal
statute
as
this
court
has
held
many
times,
the
statute
must
be
strictly
construed.
if
there's
any
ambiguity
in
the
statute,
that
ambiguity
must
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
accused.
if
the
statute
is
perceptible
of
two
interpretations
on
a
criminal
basis,
the
interpretation
which
favors
the
accused
must
be
used.
there
can
be
no
steps,
there
can
be
no
constructive
federal
offenses,
no
constructive
offenses.
and
we
believe,
your
honors,
that
when
we
read
into
that
black
bass
act
today,
that
was
passed
in
1926,
that
it
implied
to
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
game
commission
which
came
in
many
years
later
that
we
thereby
make
a
constructive
offense
which
this
court
from
time
immemorial
says
we
cannot
do
any
criminal
case.
i
would
like
to
address
my
remarks
a
little
bit
to
the
little
pamphlet
here
which
the
government
has
seen
fit
to
introduce
before
this
court
in
its
brief
and
that's
called
the
wildlife
code
of
the
state
of
florida.
now,
actually
we're
not
here
falling
with
the
game
and
fish
commission
of
florida,
but
i
think
that
we
--
we're
only
falling
with
a
little
bit
with
respect
to
a
federal
criminal
--
criminal
action
attaching
to
any
arbitrary
rule
that
that
board
of
four
or
five
members
might
--
might
pass.
now,
it's
impossible
to
codify
the
rules
and
regulations
of
this
game
and
fish
commission.
for
example,
our
legislature
meets
every
two
years
and
--
and
the
laws
of
--
that
are
passed
without
legislature
become
the
laws
of
the
state
and
they
are
--
they
are
codified
by
the
secretary
of
state
of
florida
statutes
and
then
those
laws
are
published
by
the
west
publishing
company
and
harrison
publishing
company
as
florida
statutes
annotated.
because
of
the
nature
of
these
rules
and
the
changeableness
of
these
rules,
it
is
impossible
to
codify
with
our
statutes
in
a
rule
of
this
fresh
and
game
fish
--
fish
commission.
and
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
that
was
not
the
intention
of
the
congress
when
it
gave
it
--
gave
that
power
to
the
--
when
it
talked
about
the
law
of
the
state
that
it
did
not
consider
that
a
citizen
or
a
--
a
board
of
three
or
four
citizens
could
automatically
invoke
the
long
arm
of
the
federal
government
because
of
some
arbitrary
change
in
rule
that
that
commission
makes
which
are
not
codified
among
our
statutes
in
which
it
cannot
be
codified
among
our
statutes.
mr.
clarence
l.
thacker
this
is
the
game
and
fresh
water
rules
what
--
wildlife
code
of
the
state
of
florida,
your
honor.
mr.
clarence
l.
thacker
that
justice
brennan,
that's
a
very
good
question.
it's
printed
at
the
will
of
the
commissioner
and
if
you
will
notice
on
the
back
of
this
book
--
mr.
clarence
l.
thacker
yes,
sir,
it's
found
with
the
government.
mr.
clarence
l.
thacker
we
don't
seem
to
have
that
at
least
i
have
one
now.
mr.
clarence
l.
thacker
but
the
government
brief
recites
it
had,
sir.
if
i'm
in
error
--
mr.
clarence
l.
thacker
--
i
got
it
through
the
government's
brief.
mr.
clarence
l.
thacker
maybe
it
hasn't
been
circulated,
but
it
--
mr.
clarence
l.
thacker
it
was
filed
with
the
government's
brief.
unfortunately,
there
were
only
two
copies
that
were
obtained
(inaudible)
now,
i'd
be
very
happy
to
obtain
copies
--
mr.
clarence
l.
thacker
no,
sir.
mr.
clarence
l.
thacker
i
am
absolutely,
sir.
mr.
clarence
l.
thacker
i'm
saying
it
for
this
reason,
your
honor.
i
have
to
give
you
several
reasons
to
tell
you
why.
a
lawyer
--
a
lawyer
can
write
to
tallahassee,
the
state
capital
in
florida
and
obtain
this
book.
but
at
the
time
he
gets
this
book
--
mr.
clarence
l.
thacker
yes,
sir,
i
think
so.
but
at
the
time
he
obtains
this
book,
various
rules
and
regulations
may
be
changed
then.
and
then
from
time
to
time
as
this
commission
meets,
it
puts
up
special
preference
which
changes
many
of
these
rules.
mr.
clarence
l.
thacker
well,
sir,
these
rules
are
--
are
subject
to
change
without
notice
and
i
dare
say
that
there's
not
a
dozen
lawyers
in
the
state
of
florida
that
knows
from
any
particular
time
what
the
rule
of
this
game
and
fresh
water
--
mr.
clarence
l.
thacker
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
clarence
l.
thacker
i
beg
pardon,
sir?
mr.
clarence
l.
thacker
they
are
in
fact
changed
without
notice,
yes.
mr.
clarence
l.
thacker
yes,
sir,
it'd
lose
--
it's
lose
a
page.
mr.
clarence
l.
thacker
i
would
like
to
address
my
remarks
to
that
in
one
second.
the
legislature
has
come
along
whether
it
had
the
power
to
do
so
or
not
and
as
we
locate
in
this
pamphlet,
you
will
find
the
section
of
the
statute
which
says,
that
if
this
--
if
the
law
has
a
statewide
application,
then
a
certified
copy
of
that
the
rule
for
this
commission
must
be
filed
with
the
secretary
of
state
for
a
period
of
30
days.
but
if
the
--
if
the
commission
passes
a
rule
which
is
of
a
reasonable
nature,
of
a
local
nature,
then
it
must
be
--
the
certified
copy
must
be
on
file
with
the
secretary
of
state
for
a
period
of
20
days.
then
the
legislature
comes
along
and
says
that
the
above
provisions
are
directly
only
and
not
mandatory.
so
we
contend,
your
honors,
that
under
such
set
of
circumstances
of
that
that
congress
could
not
have
intended,
in
fact,
that
a
--
that
a
criminal
--
federal
criminal
penalties
should
attach
to
a
rule
or
regulation
of
four
or
five
members
which
members
would
change
as
it
will.
mr.
clarence
l.
thacker
i
dare
say,
your
honor,
that
there
are
probably
some
necessity
for
that.
and
i
say
again
that
these
rules
and
regulations
do
have
the
force
and
effect
of
law
in
the
state
of
florida
and
they
are
enforced
as
long
as
the
rule
or
regulation
comes
within
the
amendment
itself.
mr.
clarence
l.
thacker
no,
sir.
mr.
clarence
l.
thacker
i
--
i
mean
that
the
courts
enforce
them
that
--
mr.
clarence
l.
thacker
well
--
for
--
for
example
--
mr.
clarence
l.
thacker
for
example,
the
leading
case
that
the
government
relies
on
here
is
called
the
(inaudible)
case
in
which
a
citizen
was
charged
with
the
possession
of
alligators
in
less
than
8-feet
in
length.
the
--
the
(inaudible)
was
convicted
and
the
case
went
to
the
supreme
court.
while
that
case
was
before
the
supreme
court
and
before
the
court
had
rendered
its
decision
the
game
and
fish
commission
had
changed
this
rule
and
says
it
was
against
the
law
to
catch
alligators
less
than
6-feet
in
length.
but
anyway,
the
game
--
the
supreme
court
did
say
that
the
conviction
was
--
should
stand
and
that
the
--
before
--
that
the
rules
and
regulations
for
a
fact
the
purchase
did
have
the
force
and
effect
of
law,
but
--
mr.
clarence
l.
thacker
if
--
if
i
understand
your
question,
your
honor
--
mr.
clarence
l.
thacker
the
legislature
has
the
power
under
the
constitutional
amendment
to
assess
penalties
of
--
against
the
--
of
the
rules
which
is
set
forth
in
this
book.
mr.
clarence
l.
thacker
right.
mr.
clarence
l.
thacker
i
think
i'm
correct
on
that.
mr.
clarence
l.
thacker
i
think
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
clarence
l.
thacker
your
honor,
i
don't
know
offhand.
but
it's
--
mr.
clarence
l.
thacker
your
honor,
the
--
mr.
clarence
l.
thacker
there
was
a
statute
of
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
florida
which
was
--
which
prohibited
transportation
of
black
bass.
but
that
statute
was
repealed
by
the
legislature
of
1951.
so
today,
there
is
no
statute
on
the
--
on
the
--
there
is
no
legislative
actions
--
acts
on
the
books
of
florida
which
prohibits
the
transportation.
now,
i
don't
know
how
long
the
--
it's
been
illegal
in
florida
to
transport
black
bass
without
the
state.
but
the
point
is
this
and
it's
not
inconceivable
that
it
happen.
mr.
clarence
l.
thacker
that
--
mr.
clarence
l.
thacker
oh,
no,
sir
--
no,
sir.
the
point
is
--
mr.
clarence
l.
thacker
i
don't
know
offhand
when
the
--
when
the
regulation
was
passed
but
it's
been
passed
sometime
ago.
but
the
point
is
that
this
game
and
fresh
water
fish
commission
can
it
--
its
discretion
change
--
change
its
mind
at
anytime
as
to
--
as
to
that
black
bass
regulation
or
any
other
one
of
these
regulations.
and
we
say
when
that
is
--
when
--
when
that
authority
is
given
to
two
or
three
men
that
can
automatically
invoke
a
federal
penal
statute
that
the
congress
never
intended
to
make
that
the
law
of
the
state.
and
we
submit,
your
honor,
that
on
that
basis
that
the
eminent
district
judge
was
correct
and
properly
acquires
the
information
in
this
case.
