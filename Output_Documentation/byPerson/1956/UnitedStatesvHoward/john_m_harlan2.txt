said
you're
catching

short
fish,
pulled
out

my
question
was,
how

the

(inaudible)
justice
john

did
this

come
to

say?
justice
john
m.
harlan
wait
a
second.
now,
in
1926,
how

states
could
you
give
us?
how
many
states
were
administering
their
fishing

game
laws
through
this
administrative
procedure
in
1926?
could
you
do
that
piece
of
research
and
inform
us
on
that?
