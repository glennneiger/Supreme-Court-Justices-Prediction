justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
before
you
leave
that
paragraph
that
you
referred
us
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
the
last
paragraph
on
the
next
page
doesn't
take
the
opposite
view.
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
the
bottom
of
page
13,
it
says
even
if
the
rules
and
regulations
of
a
commission
under
some
conditions
could
be
the
law
of
a
state,
it
does
not
follow
that
these
are
the
laws
applied.
we
take
position
that
they
are
not
the
law
applied.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
they
publish
that?
do
the
other
states
publish
their
laws?
are
there
rules?
are
--
are
--
there's
--
there's
a
claim
here
that
these
rules
are
not
published,
as
i
gather
it
and
that
--
that
you
have
no
way
to
know
what
they
are
and
that
they
change
from
time
to
time
without
any
publication.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
we
--
it
hasn't
been
filed
with
us.
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
it
had.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
not
been
circulated
perhaps.
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
they
obtain
nine
i
suppose?
[laughter]
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
honor
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
they
in
the
code
of
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
an
additional
question
about
your
publication.
how
often
is
that
little
code
published?
do
you
know?
maybe
you
would
know.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
periodically,
what
does
that
mean?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
this,
i
understood
to
say
that
the
law
requires
that
when
they
change
this,
they
send
one
copy
to
a
probate
judge,
county
judge,
and
one
copy
to
the
secretary
of
state.
of
course,
a
lot
more
people
fish
in
florida
today.
and
i
--
i'm
wondering
what
provision
there
is
for
that
publication
to
reach
the
public
outside
of
that.
i
understand
that
these
--
these
regulations
constantly
change.
i
--
i
believe
you
said
that.
it
had
to
but
for
the
season
and
so
forth.
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
synopsis
of
the
fishing
laws?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
cover
the
regulations
that
are
going
along?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
by
that
the
--
that
the
publication
of
the
regulations
to
the
board
on
the
back
of
the
license?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
suppose
those
are
published
there
frequently
so
that
changes
wouldn't
be
very
--
wouldn't
very
easily
reach
the
people
through
that
matter.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
law
book
refer
to
those
as
laws?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
does
it
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that
supposed
to
--
i
mean
is
that
printed
in
one
the
briefs?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
an
act
of
the
legislature?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
it
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
where
does
it
say
that
regulations
and
rules
are
laws?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
--
does
the
constitutional
amendment
refer
to
the
commission's
rules
and
regulations
as
laws?
has
anybody
ever
referred
to
it
as
laws
before
in
a
--
in
any
of
the
legislative
acts
or
in
the
constitutional
provision?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
florida?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
it
authorizes
and
promulgates
regulations
and
rules.
but
does
it
refer
to
them
as
laws?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
they
ever
referred
to
them
as
laws?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
where
--
where
--
for
what
violations
of
laws?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
does
it
say
--
does
it
say
anywhere
that
regulations
and
rules
are
to
be
treated
as
laws?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
on
--
has
there
been
any
of
them
published
which
referred
to
as
laws
or
any
state
publication
of
any
kind
referred
to
them
as
laws?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
if
these
other
states
refer
to
these
as
laws
rather
than
the
rules
and
regulations?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
--
i'm
thinking
about
congress
passing
a
law
and
when
it
said
laws,
i
have
always,
to
myself
rather
had
a
distinction
in
my
mind
between
laws
and
rules
and
regulation
of
a
board
and
maybe
congress
might
have.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
can
be
easily
said
that
instead
of
saying
the
laws,
they
could
have
said
laws
and
regulations
in
this
law
in
which
you
rely
on
which
there's
information
read.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
it
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
what
is
the
reference
directly
to
--
to
the
laws?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
was
1937?
