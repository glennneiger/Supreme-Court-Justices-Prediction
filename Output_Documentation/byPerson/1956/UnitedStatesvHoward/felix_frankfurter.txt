justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
sand,
looking
at
the
index
of
cases
of
your
brief,
i
noticed
there's
no
reference
to
the
united
states
against
eaton
and
caha
against
united
states.
these
were
the
given,
united
states
against
eaton,
that
was
the
case
where
the
prohibition
of
a
criminal
statute.
this
was
the
violation
and
to
anyone,
the
party
shall
knowingly
admit
et
cetera
anything
to
be
--
any
of
the
things
required
by
law
(inaudible)
and
this
court
held
that
violation
of
a
regulation
by
the
appropriate
department
is
not
a
violation
of
law.
and
i
think
that
was
the
case
which
started
the
common
practice
is
to
stay
in
power
that
if
the
statute
gives
the
rule
making
power,
he
--
he
can
make
some
other
offense
to
violate
any
regulation,
that's
all
right
because
i
noticed
in
the
brief
that
was
cited
by
either
side
and
i
don't
see
why
not,
but
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
should
be
--
i
think
i
would
be
giving
you
a
hard
time
on
the
u.s.
against
eaton.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
wasn't
until
the
(inaudible)
case.
the
enforcement
of
--
of
criminal
statutes
against
the
violation
of
its
accusation,
et
cetera
and
violation
of
the
standard
of
security
they
were
both
in
for
prior
regulations.
this
business
that
the
obvious
intent
of
congress
would
not
be
(inaudible)
about
it.
this
leads
me
into
the
esoteric
knowledge
of
the
congress
is
unfortunately,
never
having
been
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that
there
is
a
party
of
legislative
hearing
which
puts
a
gloss
under
what
lawyers
do
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
they,
specifically?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
to
establish
that
to
get
by
with
me,
anyhow.
justice
felix
frankfurter
wait
a
minute,
let
me
look
into
it.
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
i
should
say
that
looks
two
ways.
justice
felix
frankfurter
coming
out
with
the
starting
point
that
while
one
should
twist
land
without
a
shape
you
in
order
to
become
a
statute
but
if
there
is
doubt,
you
incline
one
way
rather
than
another,
if
we
let
our
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
--
i
didn't
say
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
you
mean
the
same
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
let
me
put
my
eyes
on
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
do
you
mind
pointing
out
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
there
reflective
statements
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
is
the
same
as
to
all
fish.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
federal's
--
the
black
bass
act
wasn't
to
strictly
to
apply
though,
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
what
the
state
--
to
what
state
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
black
bass
centralizes
or
if
it's
allowed
to
swim
but
there
may
have
been
states
when
this
was
as
apparent
that
(inaudible)
through
speculations.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
thacker,
may
i
--
may
i
repeat
the
question
asked
by
my
brother
brennan?
are
you
suggesting
that
this
publication
is
a
publication
that
was
not
easily
available?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
i'm
asking
for
--
why
do
you
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
to
ask
you
because
this
court
had
a
case
--
rather
--
what
is
the
word
“memorable”
in
this
district
(inaudible)
unavailability,
inaccessibility
of
rules
and
regulations.
thus
this
court
on
page
7
said
this
at
the
time
of
argument
simply
to
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
our
case
in
which
if
it'd
be
true
that
these
are
regulations
promulgated
by
your
provision,
whatever
it's
called,
subject
to
change
without
notice,
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
(inaudible)
case
i
think
deserves
contention?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
they
criminally
enforced?
are
there
criminal
sanctions
implied
and
not
more
than
that?
what
do
you
mean
by
enforce?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
in
what
way
albeit
the
situation
derives?are
there
local
penalties
and
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
conjunctions
or
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
--
is
that
a
--
is
there
a
specific
provision
in
your
state
to
which
violation
of
rules
and
regulations
are
deemed
to
be
or
rather
make
offenses
or
is
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
is,
does
your
--
does
florida
law
as
applied
to
the
statute
says,
as
any
rules
and
regulations
in
conformity
therewith
are
between
violations
of
this
act
or
is
that
influential?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
--
so
that
the
constitution
authorizes
violations
of
rules.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
explicit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
means
that
before
you
finish
and
before
you
--
you
better
have
to
find
out
whether
you
can
fish
or
what
or
how
long
or
how
short
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then
mr.
thacker
says
that
the
lady
may
go
out
and
fish
under
the
(inaudible)
which
the
last
one
she
had,
but
just
the
day
before
they
changed
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
thacker
says
that,
if
i
understood
him,
and
if
that's
a
direct
issue
and
not
mandatory.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
--
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
30
days.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
have
to
--
does
--
does
it
matter
whether
it
is
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
say
that?
why
do
you
say
it
doesn't
matter
if
it'd
be
true
that
these
rules
nobody
can
if
--
can
know
what
the
rules
are
in
the
order
wherein
which
lies
(inaudible)
before
they
need
to
change
on
them
overnight.
i'm
not
saying
that
is
the
way
to
regulate
fish.
that
is
not
the
problem
but
maybe
the
wisest
thing
to
regulate
fish.
and
i
thought
that
my
brother
harlan
is
a
fisherman
as
i
am
not.
the
problem
that
i
do
understand
is
if
that
be
so,
then
you
got
a
problem
with
instruction
whether
congress
by
using
that
term,
a
term
which
may
incorporate
such
angulatory,
such
fugitive
regulation
is
to
be
covered
by
the
term
"laws".
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
one
concluded
that
the
(inaudible)
six
laws
have
enactments
by
legislature.
was
the
reenactment
in
the
--
and
when
was
this,
the
last
reenacted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
--
would
then
1952
did
that
translate
in
who
regulates
the
district
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
that
--
suppose
i
conclude
that
if
i
had
to
stop
with
1926,
i
would
(inaudible)
in
light
of
the
extensive
development,
the
administrative
agencies
and
their
regulations
call
for
a
change
of
that
(inaudible)
of
our
views?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
a
part
of
that's
covered
and
one
--
two
of
them
would
seem
to
be
very
helpful
at
least
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
actually,
my
mind
is
made
up
onwards.
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
other
words
--
in
other
words,
in
--
in
enactments
of
this
sort,
there
maybe
plain
indication
and
indeed
expressions
calling
for
cooperation
in
the
federal
party
if
the
state
assigns,
non-concept,
thereby
all
regulations
were
swept
into
the
combination
as
offenses.
it's
a
different
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
again,
you
just
got
the
coverage.
so,
if
the
congress
in
1926
had
awareness
of
the
fact
that
regulation
is
more
being
issued
by
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
department
of
interior.
and
that
sort
of
law,
i
suggest
that
that's
a
double-edged
sword
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
that's
the
inquiry.
the
inquiry
was
directed
as
i
understood
it.
the
inquiry
was
how
many
states
in
1926
enforced
game
and
fishing
laws
through
the
regulatory
system.
and
you
replied
well
--
in
any
event,
the
federal
government
said
and
i
say
that
doesn't
tell
very
much
for
you.
it
looks
in
both
directions
as
janitors.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
sand,
as
--
as
mr.
chief
justice
was
referring
(inaudible)
if
your
brief
does
not
--
you
need
to
tell
me
that
it
does,
if
your
brief
has
not
addressed
itself
to
the
questions
that
have
been
raised
as
to
the
--
what
i
call
the
fugitive
character
unavailable,
this
difficulty
surrounding
why
easily
obtained
knowledge
through
this
conflict,
is
in
short,
the
conflict
is
difficult
to
get
at.
it
further
more
(inaudible)
whether
it
would
be
changed
overnight,
in
30
days
in
this
directory
as
your
brief
has
dealt
with
--
with
the
implications
of
such
difficulties
in
ascertaining
what's
supposed
is
“the
law”
of
florida
is,
then
as
i
said
referring
to
the
chief
justice
in
as
far
as
discernment
is
likely
to
have
an
additional
memorandum
of
the
government
addressing
itself
with
that
act
that's
in
the
case
to
--
and
particularly,
to
have
in
mind
the
implications,
the
well-known
historical
implications,
the
argument
to
this
court
of
the
hot
oil
case
in
293
u.s.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
does
--
does
the
brief
deal
with

if
you
take
