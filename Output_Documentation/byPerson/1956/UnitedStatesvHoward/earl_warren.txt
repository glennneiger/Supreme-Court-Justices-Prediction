chief

warren
the
delegation
of
these
powers
--
plenary
powers
so-called
to
fish
and
game
commissions
and
the
states
is
something
of
a
quite
recent
origin,
isn't
it,
and
development?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
i
recall
it,
we've
had
it
in
california
for
some
over
six
or
eight
years
and
at
that
--
at
the
time,
we
--
we
undertook
to
do
it.i
think
there
were
not
many
states
in
the
union
that
--
that
had
it.
to
my
recollection
is
that
that
was
rather
recent
that
they
had
amended.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
have
--
they
have
changed
it
several
times
to
include
other
fish
and
they
--

or
--
chief

warren
and
how
about
other
fish?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sand,
is
there
any
procedural
requirement
for
the
change
of
these
regulations
that
is
calling
for
public
notice
having
it
be
done
at
a
public
hearing,
the
right
of
anybody
to
appear
in
--
in
opposition
to
it
or
posting
afterwards
or
anything
of
that
kind
other
than
what
you
have
said
here
just
filing
it
through
a
secretary
of
state
or
the
county
judge?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
there's
no
requirement
beforehand.
do
they
have
to
give
notice
if
they're
going
to
--
they're
going
to
consider
the
change
of
rule?
must
it
be
done
at
a
public
meeting?does
anyone
have
a
right
to
object
to
the
change
or
--
or
advocate
it?

chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
mr.
sand,
that
you
overlooked
the
fact
that
--
that
these
commissions
are
--
are
all
relatively
new
in
our
state
systems.
and
many
of
them
started
out
few
years
ago
without
any
procedures
at
all.
they
would
change
a
regulation
overnight
and
people
just
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
know
what
the
regulation
was
and
i
know
in
my
state
and
i
have
no
doubt
in
other
states
that
--
that
recently
and
only
comparatively,
recently
have
we
tightened
up
the
laws
so
that
that
can't
be
done.
and
so
that
they
must
give
notice
of
a
change
of
a
--
a
regulation
of
this
kind
if
it's
to
be
considered
law.
they
must
--
they
must
have
it
--
do
it
at
a
public
hearing.
the
public
must
have
a
right
to
be
heard
on
it
and
--
and
so
forth.
now,
my
point
is
this.
would
congress
in
1926,
when
it
--
when
this
act
was
enacted
have
in
mind
recognizing
such
regulations
as
law?
now,
you're
taking
the
most
favorable
part
of
it.
it
seems
to
me
the
way
the
thing
is
at
the
present
time.
i'm
saying,
well,
congress
must
admit
that,
but
i
don't
know
whether
the
congress
would
have
admit
that
in
1926
when
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
real
stability
to
--
to
such
rules
or
no
procedural
requirements
in
changing
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
in
fish
and
game
matters,
the
government
collaborates
with
states
but
they
don't
always
accept
their
regulations
as
laws
in
other
instances.
