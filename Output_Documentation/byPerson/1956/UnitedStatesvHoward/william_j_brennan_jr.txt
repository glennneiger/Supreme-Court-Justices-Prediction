justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
sand,
is
there
anything
to
the
point
that
apparently
this
commission
may
make
regulations
as
one
county
or
one
section
and
not
for
other
sections
of
the
state
may
adopt
them
tonight
and
change
them
tomorrow.
i
gather
that's
the
argument.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
these
are
a
register
of
some
kind?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
thacker,
what
is
that
little
book
that
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
mean
is
that
printed
periodically
or
reprinted
or
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
was
that
filed
here
with
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
seemed
you
haven't.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
will
notice
on
the
back
pages
of
this
book,
the
game
commissioner
himself
certifies
that
this
book
is
the
rule
or
the
rules
and
regulations
of
a
certain
date.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
difficult
to
get
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
down
here
and
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
didn't
you
suggest
that
they're
not
merely
subject
to
change
without
notice
because
they
are
in
fact
changed
and
not
taken
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
these
little
pamphlets
or
something
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
thacker,
as
it
says
and
the
answer
to
that
question,
the
--
so
far
as
the
statute
which
the
government
has
printed
at
page
46,
any
person
violating
any
rule,
regulation
or
order
of
the
game
and
fresh
water
fish
commission
that
that
and
pursuant
to
section
30,
article
iv
of
the
constitution
of
the
state
and
this
chapter
shall
be
guilty
of
misdemeanor?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
made
a
crime.
but
what's
his
punishment
for
--
on
--
on
conviction
for
misdemeanor
on
the
clause?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
didn't
help
your
case
any
(inaudible)
recently
available.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
