mr.
leonard
b.
sand
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
from
an
order
of
the
district
court
of
the
southern
district
of
florida
dismissing
an
information
which
was
brought
under
title
16,
section
852,
commonly
known
as
the
black
bass
act,
although
that
statute
now
applies
to
all
fish.
the
information
set
forth
on
pages
1
and
2
of
the
record
charged
that
when
ludenia
howard
trading
as
the
stokes
fish
company
delivered
to
the
railway
express
agency
in
the
state
of
florida
for
transportation
to
the
state
of
georgia,
150
pounds
of
freshwater
bream,
freshwater
crappie
and
freshwater
black
bass.
and
that
such
transportation
was
then
contrary
to
the
laws
of
the
state
of
florida
and
in
violations
of
the
black
bass
act.
the
black
bass
act,
set
forth
at
page
39
of
the
government's
brief,
provides
that
it
should
be
unlawful
for
any
person
to
deliver
for
transportation
from
one
state
to
another
any
black
bass
or
other
fish
if
such
transportation
is
contrary
to
--
to
the
law
of
the
state
from
which
the
black
bass
or
other
fish
is
or
is
to
be
transported.
the
defendant
moved
in
the
lower
court
to
dismiss
the
information
on
the
grounds
that
it
failed
to
state
the
cause
of
action
and
this
motion
was
granted.
the
order
dismissing
the
information
appears
on
page
3
of
the
record
and
the
judge
there
said
that
the
only
prohibition
against
the
out-of-state
transportation
of
the
fish,
set
forth
in
the
information,
was
found
in
the
regulations
of
the
game
and
fresh
water
fish
commission
of
the
state
of
florida.
and
being
of
the
opinion
that
the
rules
and
regulations
of
this
commission
do
not
constitute
the
law
of
florida
as
described
by
and
contemplated
by
the
black
bass
act,
the
information
was
dismissed.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
he
meant
that
you
have
to
have
a
statute,
yes,
your
honor.
as
this
was
a
decision
dismissing
an
information
based
on
the
construction
of
the
statute
upon
which
the
information
was
founded,
the
government
took
a
direct
appeal
and
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction.
we
--
we
look
then
at
the
outset
to
the
status
of
these
rules
and
regulations
as
they
exist
in
the
state
of
florida.
in
the
1942,
general
election,
florida
amended
its
constitution
by
enacting
article
iv,
section
30,
set
forth
at
page
43
of
the
government's
brief.
this
constitutional
amendment
created
the
fresh
water
fish
commissions
and
conferred
upon
it,
the
power
to
regulate
the
manner
and
method
of
taking,
transporting,
storing
and
using
fresh
water
fish
among
other
things.
it
was
also
provided
in
this
constitutional
amendment,
section
7
on
page
44
of
the
government's
brief
that
the
legislature
may
enact
any
laws
in
the
aid
of
but
not
inconsistent
with
the
provisions
of
this
amendment
and
all
existing
laws
inconsistent
herewith
shall
no
longer
remain
in
force
and
effect.
all
laws
fixing
penalties
for
the
violation
of
the
provisions
of
this
amendment
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i'm
on
page
44
of
the
government's
brief.
all
laws
fixing
penalties
for
the
violation
of
the
provisions
of
this
amendment
and
all
laws
imposing
license
taxes
shall
be
enacted
by
the
legislature
from
time
to
time.
in
other
words,
florida
by
constitutional
amendment
vested
in
this
commission
supreme
authority
over
the
regulation
of
fresh
water
fish
and
left
to
the
legislature
only
the
power
to
act
--
to
enact
consistent
laws
and
laws
fixing
penalties
and
license
taxes.
the
florida
game
commission
pursuant
to
this
constitutional
authority
enacted
a
rule,
rule
1401,
cited
at
page
48
of
the
government's
brief.
and
that
rule
provided
that
no
person
should
transport
out
of
the
state
florida
any
black
bass,
bringing
some
fish
and
other
enumerated
fishes.
the
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes,
your
honor.
the
florida
legislature
enacted
section
372.83,
cited
at
page
46
of
the
government's
brief,
and
that
statute
provides
that
any
person
who
violates
any
rule
or
regulation
of
the
commission
adopted
pursuant
to
the
constitutional
amendment
shall
be
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor.
therefore,
there
existed
in
florida
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
defense,
a
rule
promulgated
by
the
commission
acting
pursuant
to
constitutional
authority
prohibiting
this
transportation
and
a
florida
statute
enacted
by
the
legislature
providing
that
any
violation
of
that
rule
would
be
a
misdemeanor.
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
as
to
the
validity
of
the
rules
or
regulations
in
the
state
of
florida.
the
florida
supreme
court
has
held
that
they
have
the
effect
of
law
in
that
state
and
indeed,
appellee
concedes
this.
on
page
12
of
appellee's
brief,
the
following
language
appears.we
frankly
and
fully
concede
that
the
florida
commission
is
a
legally
constituted
commission.
we
also
concede
without
argument
that
its
rules
are
enforced
in
the
state
of
florida
so
long
as
these
rules
are
within
the
scope
of
the
amendment
creating
it,
and
i
may
state
parenthetically,
there
is
no
question
here
but
the
rules
are
within
the
scope
of
the
amendment.
for
this
purpose,
appellee
concedes.
in
the
state
of
florida,
they
are
given
the
force
and
effect
of
law.
however,
this
does
not
make
them
the
law
of
florida
as
contemplated
by
the
black
bass
act.
it
is
with
this
last
statement
the
government
takes
issue.
for
it
is
the
government's
position
that
when
congress
in
the
black
bass
act
said
contrary
to
the
law
of
any
state,
it
meant
contrary
to
such
law
as
that
state
should
probably
consider
binding
upon
its
citizens.
since
there
is
no
question
but
the
florida
considers
these
rules
and
regulations
valid
and
enforces
them,
there's
no
question
but
that
they
should
be
the
laws
of
the
state
within
the
meaning
of
the
black
bass
act.
the
black
bass
act
was
originally
enacted
in
1926.
prior
to
that
time,
this
court
had
on
many
occasions
construed
phrases
such
as
state
statute,
more
restrictive
phrases
than
law
of
the
state
to
include
administrate
regulations
as
well
as
states
statutes.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
i
--
i
believe
in
the
next
paragraph,
appellee
is
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
not
the
law
of
the
fact
but
believe,
appellee
there
means,
not
the
law
of
florida
within
the
meaning
of
the
black
bass
act
even
though
they
are
the
law
of
florida
within
the
state
of
florida
itself.
the
--
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
black
bass
act
indicates
that
it
was
intended
to
apply
only
to
administrative
regulations.
indeed,
in
the
senate
bill,
accompanying
the
1947
amendments
of
the
black
bass
act
cited
that,
at
the
bottom
page
of
29
and
30
of
the
government's
brief,
it
is
said
that
if
we
are
protecting
fish,
an
important
natural
resource,
the
federal
government
must
collaborate
in
the
enforcement
of
protective
laws
and
regulations
at
the
point
where
state
jurisdiction
ends.
and
it
must
also
be
remembered
that
we
are
acting
here
in
the
context
of
conservation,
an
area
in
which
both
the
federal
government
and
the
states,
have
traditionally
proceeded
through
administrative
regulation.
indeed,
this
is
recognized
in
other
provisions
of
title
16.
thus,
in
section
669
of
title
16,
cited
at
pages
24
and
25
of
the
government's
brief,
it
is
provided
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
authorized
to
cooperate
with
the
states
through
their
respective
state
fish
and
game
departments.
and
then
skipping,
it
says,
“but
no
money
apportioned
under
said
sections
to
any
state
shall
be
expended
therein
until
its
legislature
or
other
state
agency
authorized
by
the
state
constitution
to
make
laws
governing
the
conservation
of
wildlife
shall
have
assented
to
the
provisions
of
said
sections.
congress
there
specifically
has
recognized
that
state
agencies
may
be
authorized
by
the
state
constitution
to
enact
laws
governing
conservation
and
then
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
we
--
we
think
not,
mr.
justice
brennan.
with
respect
to
the
local
nature
of
some
regulations,
indeed,
before
the
constitutional
amendment
was
passed,
that's
precisely
what
the
state
legislature
did.
so,
there's
no
inherent
difference
between
the
regulations
of
the
commission
and
the
--
and
the
state
legislature.
in
sylvester
against
tindall,
cited
at
page
19
of
the
government's
brief,
the
florida
supreme
court
reviewed
the
past
history
of
conservation
and
legislation
in
that
state
and
noted
that
--
that
for
many
years,
the
legislature
had
tried
in
vain
to
adequately
deal
with
the
subject
matter
of
this
amendment
by
local
or
special
acts.
and
--
and
so
we
feel
that
that
distinction
is
without
merit.
with
respect
to
the
changeable
nature
of
these
regulations,
i
might
say
that
it
has
been
the
law
of
florida
consistently
since
1927
that
out-of-state
transportation
of
black
bass
was
illegal,
besides
which
the
florida
legislature
has
provided
rules
for
the
promulgation
of
the
commission's
regulations.
these
rules
provide
for
publication
in
a
newspaper
for
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes.
they
--
they
must
be
filed
with
the
--
a
certified
copy
must
be
filed
with
the
secretary
of
state
and
the
rules
of
statewide
application
as
this
particular
rule
is
--
cannot
be
effective
until
30
days
thereafter.
i
--
i
deal
with
that
question
on
the
merits
although
since
that
was
not
the
basis
of
the
decision
of
the
district
court,
it
is
a
question
not
for
this
court
in
this
--
at
this
stage
of
--
of
this
case.
so
the
--
the
construction
placed
upon
the
black
bass
act
by
the
court
below
would
nullify
that
act
in
all
but
six
states
of
the
union
for
--
in
all
but
six
states.
the
subject
matter
with
which
we
are
here
concerned
is
dealt
with
by
administrative
agencies.
in
42
other
states
rules
and
regulations
the
law
of
the
state
with
respect
to
fresh
water
fishing,
are
promulgated
by
fish
commissions.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
think,
your
honor,
that
that
claim
here
is
--
is
not
that
they
are
not
published
because
certainly
they
are
published.
they
are
available
in
a
--
in
a
handbook
which
is
available
to
anybody,
writing
to
the
commission
for
it
and
also
on
file
with
the
local
judge.
i
think
the
claim
is
that
a
regulation
cannot
be
the
law
because
it
--
it
may
be
changed
from
day
to
day.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
these
regulations
cannot
be
changed
from
day
to
day.
they
can
go
into
effect
only
30
days
after
they
have
been
filed
with
the
secretary
of
state
of
florida.
and
as
i
have
said,
and
in
--
in
fact,
there
has
been
no
change
in
this
particular
law
of
florida
since
1927.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
i
--
i
think,
your
honor,
in
interpreting
what
congress
meant
when
it
used
the
phrase
contrary
to
the
law
of
the
state
in
this
statute
which
was
derived
from
the
1900
lacey
act
with
respect
to
birds
and
wild
animals.
one
has
to
look
to
the
purpose
of
the
--
of
the
statute,
the
obvious
intent
of
congress
acting
in
the
field
where
administrative
action
is
the
traditional
form,
the
widespread
form.
and
that
in
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
but
i
think,
your
honor,
that
--
that
congress
has
--
has
spoken
in
other
provisions
of
the
black
bass
act
and
in
other
provisions
of
title
16.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes,
your
honor.
that
--
that
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
there
are
the
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
there
--
there
is
the
fact
that
in
the
black
bass
act
itself
in
section
8
cited
on
page
42
of
the
government's
brief.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
it
reads,
"nothing
in
this
chapter
shall
be
construed
to
prevent
the
several
states
and
territories
for
making,
when
enforcing
laws
or
regulations
not
inconsistent
with
the
provisions
of
this
chapter."
there
is,
as
i
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
i
--
i
grant,
your
honor,
that
--
that
it
might
that
congress
has
used
the
phrase
"regulations"
in
one
section
and
not
--
not
in
another.
i
--
i
grant
that
that
argument
would
be
available
to
the
appellee.
i
think
most
of.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
agree
that
a
penal
statute
should
be
strictly
construed.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
but
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes.
i
--
i
think
we
do.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
and
as
i
have
--
i've
previously
made
reference
to
section
669
of
title
16
in
which
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
that's
on
pages
24
and
25
of
the
government's
brief.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
the
--
the
italicized
language
there,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
authorized
by
the
state
constitution
to
make
laws
governing
the
conservation
of
wildlife.
so,
congress
here
has
recognized
that
laws
using
not
rules
or
regulations
but
the
very
word
“laws”
may
be
promulgated
by
a
state
through
an
agency
other
than
the
legislature.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
think
it
does,
sir.
and
the
legislative
history
to
the
--
to
the
1947
amendment
to
the
bill,
cited
at
pages
29
and
30
of
the
government's
brief,
in
which
the
intent
there
is
explicitly
stated
to
collaborate
in
the
enforcement
of
protective
laws
and
regulations
at
the
point
where
state
jurisdiction
ends.

sand
page
--
at
the
bottom
of
page
29,
the
top
of
page
30
of
the
government's
brief.
the
government
feels
that
this
shows
a
--
an
intent
upon
the
part
of
congress
not
to
have
the
black
bass
act
apply
only
in
the
six
states
where
the
subject
matter
is
dealt
with
exclusively
by
the
legislature
but
in
all
48
states
including
the
42
where
rules
and
regulations
are
promulgated
by
administrative
agencies.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
--
the
act
as
originally
passed
in
1926
related
only
to
black
bass.it
was
subsequently
amended
to
apply
to
all
game
fish
and
in
1952,
it
was
amended
to
apply
to
all
fish.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
all
fish.
the
government
submits
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
is
clearly
erroneous
and
should
be
reversed.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
wish
merely
to
apologize
to
the
court
for
not
having
filed
additional
copies.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact
anybody
can
obtain
a
copy
of
the
code
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
by
writing
to
the
--
by
writing
to
the
commission.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they've
taken
care
of
--
of
that
problem
also,
your
honor,
because
a
copy
of
the
rules
are
filed
with
a
--
a
county
judge
and
so
they're
--
they
are
available
within
the
immediate
locality
in
which
the
person
might
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
mr.
thacker
overlooks
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
but,
your
honor,
i
think
that
could
not
happen
in
the
state
of
florida
because
while
some
of
the
provisions
of
the
applicable
statute
on
--
are
not
mandatory,
section
2
is
mandatory
and
that
provides
that
the
rule
shall
become
effective
30
days
after
the
filing
of
the
certified
copy
in
the
office
of
the
secretary
of
state.
and
--
and
so
that
at
least
30
days
must
elapse
before
the
rule

mr.

it

your

yes,
your
honor.
mr.

the
survey
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
can
tell
you
that
in
1954,
six
states
--
i
--
i
think
i
--
i
think
perhaps
i
have
not
understood
your
honor's
question.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
through
some
administrative
party
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
other
than
the
legislature.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
not
in
--
not
in
1926,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
but
certainly
by
1952,
which
is
the
date
of
the
last
amendment
of
the
black
bass
act,
the
practice
of
proceedings
through
these
parties
was
--
was
widespread.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
1952.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes,
i
--
i
think
so,
your
honor,
because
we
don't
have
merely
the
reenactment
of
the
statute.
we
have
legislative
history
connected
with
the
reenactment
for
the
statute.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
in
--
in
1947
for
instance,
where
--
where
it
was
said
that
the
federal
government
must
a
--
a
state
laws
and
regulations
subsequent
to
1926.
this
was
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
1926.
it's
(inaudible)
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
will
endeavor
to
do
that,
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
in
1926,
of
course,
the
federal
government
was
itself
administering
its
conservation
program
through
the
department
of
--
of
interior
and
through
administrative
action.
so,
it
would
be
anomalous
to
say
that
in
this
context
where
the
federal
government
itself
proceeds
administratively
it
enacted
a
statute
which
did
not
encompass
state
administrative
action
as
well.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
it's
department
of
interior.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
and
--
and
perhaps,
it
would
be
if
we
stopped
at
1926
when
we
look
at
the
subsequent
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes,
your
honor.
the
government
does
emphasize
the
legislative
history
connected
with
the
subsequent
amendments
to
the
black
bass
act
which
specifically
states
that
the
intent
is
to
a
federal
--
to
--
i'd
state
laws
and
regulations
in
this
area
where
the
state
enforcement
is
weakest.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
it
--
it
has
been
a
development
which
has
--
has
accelerated
in
recent
years
so
that
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
but
certainly
by
1947
and
1952
which
were
the
dates
of
the
last
two
amendments
of
this
act
that
--
that
practice
was
a
--
a
prevalent
mind,
that
the
practice
of
acting
through
these
commissions.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
it's
--
it
well,
it's
published
periodically
and
as
i
say,
it
is
available
to
anybody
who
provides
the
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
to
cover
the
--
the
individual
in
florida
who
does
not
obtain
the
--
the
booklet,
other
florida
statutes
which
--
which
govern
licenses
provide
there
shall
be
printed
on
the
back
of
the
license
for
one,
a
synopsis
of
the
fishing
laws.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
this
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
of
--
of
the
laws
which
--
which
would
apply
and
which
would
include
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes,
that
would
then
cover
this.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
that
--
that
which
would
constitute
that
the
fishing
laws
of
--
of
the
state
of
florida
which
would
include
this
regulation.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
that
there
has
been
no
change
in
--
in
the
law
of
florida
with
respect
to
black
bass
since
1927.
and
as
a
matter
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
that
the
federal
statute
but
in
florida,
it
has
consistently
been
the
law
since
1927
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
that
it
was
illegal
to
ship
--
to
ship
black
bass
out
of
the
state.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
believe
no.
the
florida
statute
of
1927
related
only
to
black
bass.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
it
was
in
1943
that
the
rule
included
the
--
the
other
fish
as
well.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
and
--
and
published
in
a
news
paper.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
as
far
as
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
i
know,
your
honor,
these
rules
are
promulgated
by
the
commission
itself
but
there
is
no
attack
here
upon
the
validity
of
the
rules.
the
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
only
question
before
this
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
court
is
--
is
whether
congress
intended
to
include
in
the
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
phrase
law
of
the
state,
rules
of
administrative
parties,
any
due
process
objections
which
might
relate
to
the
manner
of
promulgation
or
the
giving
of
notice
would
awake
some
other
stage
of
these
proceedings.
but
as
this
case
is
here
on
a
direct
appeal,
the
only
question
is
the
validity
of
the
construction
placed
upon
the
statute
by
the
district
court.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
if
--
if
congress
did
not
mean
it
in
1926,
it
certainly
meant
it
in
1947
where
the
senate
bill
which
accompanied
the
amendments
of
the
black
bass
act
specifically
stated
that
the
federal
government
must
collaborate
in
the
enforcement
of
protective
laws
and
regulations
at
a
point
where
state
jurisdiction
ends.
i
think,
your
honor,
that
it's
valid
for
the
government
to
look
to
the
practice
as
it
existed
in
1947
and
in
1952
when
the
act
was
amended
because
it
was
not
merely
a
mechanical
amendment.
there
--
there's
a
--
a
legislative
history
in
connection
with
those
amendments
indicative
of
the
congressional
intent.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
no,
but
here
congress,
in
using
the
phrase
"law
of
the
state",
did
look
to
--
to
the
--
whatever
law
that
--
that
state
felt
properly
binds
its
citizens
and
there's
no
question
here
as
to
the
validity
of
these
rules
and
regulations
within
the
state
of
florida.
with
respect
to
the
--
to
the
question
of
--
of
notice,
i
would
like
also
to
state
that
the
facts
alleged
in
the
information
indicate
that
the
defendant
here
is
a
--
a
fish
dealer
and
as
such
would
have
to
get
a
--
a
fish
license.
and
it
says
very
plainly
on
that
license
that
it
is
unlawful
for
any
wholesaler
or
retail
fish
dealer
knowingly
to
have
or
allow,
would
permit
any
that
any
black
bass
to
be
stored
on
the
premises.
so
that
certainly,
this
defendant
must
have
had
knowledge
of
--
of
the
prohibitions
with
respect
to
black
bass
that
existed
in
the
state
of
florida.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
just
the
wildlife
code
referred
to?
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
commission
refers
to
its
rules
and
regulations,
past
rules
and
regulations,
but
the
florida
legislature
refers
to
them
as
laws.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
it
does
that
in
section
372.07.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
that
is
printed
in
the
--
in
the
wildlife
code.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
that
is
a
statute,
an
act
of
the
legislature.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
it
says
that
the
game
and
fresh
water
fish
commission
and
each
and
every
one
of
its
duly
authorized
conservation
agents
shall
have
power
and
authority
throughout
the
state
to
enforce
all
laws
relating
to
game,
non-game
birds,
fresh
water
fish
and
so
on.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
by
virtue
of
the
constitutional
amendment
that
the
legislature
can
act
--
can
enact
only
such
laws
as
will
be
consistent
with
those
of
the
commission.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
in
--
in
florida.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
in
florida.
in
florida,
the
amendment
itself
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
it
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
it
--
it
does
--
it
does
in
the
particular
statute
to
which
i
referred
with
respect
to
the
power
to
arrest
for
violation
of
--
of
laws.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
laws
relating
to
game.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
there
is
as
far
as
i
know,
no
--
no
florida
statute
which
says
rules
and
regulations
shall
be
laws.
there
is
a
florida
statute.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
there
--
there's
a
--
there's
a
further
florida
statute
which
says
that
section
372.70,
which
says
that
the
prosecuting
officers
of
the
civil
courts
of
criminal
jurisdiction
of
the
state
shall
investigate
and
prosecute
all
violation
of
the
laws
relating
to
game,
fresh
water
fish.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
and
of
course,
by
virtue
of
the
constitutional
amendment,
it
is
only
this
commission
which
--
which
has
the
supreme
power
in
florida
to
--
to
regulate
fish
and
game.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
that
--
that
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
so
if
it
--
if
it
did,
it
certainly
--
it
certainly
indicated

well
--
in
the
--
in
the
--
mr.

there

could
have,
your

but

section
669
of
title
16
cited
at
pages
24
and
25
of
the
government's
brief.
mr.
leonard
b.

well,
it's

it
says
there,
at
the
top

page

it
begins
at
