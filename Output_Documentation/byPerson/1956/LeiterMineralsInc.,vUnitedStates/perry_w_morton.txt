mr.
perry
w.
morton
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
not
here
today
on
the
merits,
except
to
the
extent
required
to
show
that
the
federal
court
has
jurisdiction
of
a
case
presented
by
a
sufficient
complaint
and
to
show
the
propriety
of
its
issuance
of
the
injunction.
the
lower
courts
unanimously
had
no
doubt
about
any
of
these
points.
i
would
just
as
soon
argue
the
merits
today
but
i
shall
not
thrust
this
upon
the
court's
time
by
any
extended
statement
of
them,
beyond
that
which
may
be
necessary
in
counter
statement
to
the
discussion
yesterday.
the
petitioner's
entire
case,
on
the
merits,
hangs
on
the
louisiana
act
of
1940.
that
was
so
admitted.
here,
the
petitioner
finds
itself
on
the
horns
of
a
dilemma.
on
the
one
hand,
the
petitioner
cannot
prevail
if
the
louisiana
statute
is
interpreted
as
not
impinging
upon
the
government's
contract.
since
then
the
contract
stands
in
the
clear
of
it.likewise,
the
petitioner
cannot
prevail
if
the
louisiana
statute
is
held
to
affect
the
government's
contract.
since
then
it
necessarily
impairs
the
obligation
of
that
contract
and
falls
in
a
heap
of
unconstitutionality.
yesterday,
mr.
plauche,
several
times
referred
and
one
time
named
the
so-called
nebo
case,
decided
by
the
fifth
circuit
a
few
years
ago
in
connection
with
this
very
same
statute.
but
in
nebo,
the
united
states
bought
the
land
expressly
subject
to
a
perpetual
mineral
servitude,
outstanding
in
the
hands
of
third
parties,
under
whom
nebo
eventually
claimed.
nevertheless,
except
for
the
intervention
of
the
act
of
1940,
the
united
states,
although
it
had
not
contracted
for
the
minerals
would
have
become
the
owner
of
the
mineral
rights
under
the
louisiana
law
of
prescription,
in
the
absence
of
any
exercise
of
the
mineral
servitude
for
10
years.
thus,
on
the
familiar
rule
that
a
statute
of
limitations
can
be
altered
at
the
will
of
the
legislature,
the
fifth
circuit
held
in
nebo
that
the
rights,
which
the
united
states
would,
otherwise,
have
acquired
only
by
prescription,
had
properly
been
rendered
imprescriptible
by
the
act
of
1940.
but
the
present
case
is
as
different
from
nebo,
as
an
express
contract
is
different
from
a
statute
of
limitations.
here,
the
united
states
bought
this
property
including
the
mineral
rights
on
certain
specific
terms,
which
as
to
the
mineral
rights,
were
very
materially
different
from
the
consequences
of
statutory
prescription.
mr.
marshall
may
deal
with
those
differences
in
greater
detail.
i
will
pick
just
one
of
them
for
illustration.
under
the
louisiana
rules
of
prescription,
the
drilling
of
a
single
dry
hole,
in
good
faith,
would
interrupt
the
running
of
this
period
of
limitation
and
extend
it
for
another
10
years
as
to
the
entire
acreage,
in
this
case
more
than
8700
acres.
but
under
the
contract
in
the
leiter
case,
the
reserved
rights
were
defined
and
limited
in
meticulous
detail
and
made
finally
to
expire
on
a
day
certain,
april
1st,
1945,
absent
the
carefully
stipulated
development
requirements.
and
thereupon,
said
the
contract
shall,
“complete
fee,”
become
vested
in
the
united
states.
the
rights
of
the
united
states
originated
in
a
contract
made
with
the
leiter
estate
on
march
14th,
1935,
only
a
few
days
more
than
10
years
prior
to
the
april
1,
1945
expiration
date.
and
that,
of
course,
readily
explains
the
various
references
in
the
contract
to
a
10-year
period.
the
deed
made
in
1938,
after
the
leiter
estate
complications
had
been
closed
up
was
merely
in
consummation
of
the
1935
contract
and
copied
its
terms
verbatim.
i
cannot
recommend
that
as
a
good
conveyancing
practice
but
you
know
it
often
happens.
now,
beyond
this
brief
preliminary
review
of
the
merits,
i
should
like
to
summarize
and
set
them
in
outline,
the
points,
which
have
to
do
with
the
position
of
the
government
in
this
case,
in
its
posture
today.
the
position
of
the
government
boils
down
to
this.
the
only
issue
on
the
merits
of
either
this
case
or
this
case
in
the
state
court
is
a
dispute
about
who
has
the
title
to
the
minerals
and
the
mineral
rights
involved.
and
that
is
necessarily
a
dispute
squarely
between
the
petitioner
and
the
united
states.
the
united
states
has
submitted
that
issue
to
adjudication
in
the
federal
court,
as
it
had
a
perfect
and
clear
right
to
do
under
familiar
section
1345
of
28
u.s.c.
there
is
nothing
here
about
the
government
hiding
behind
its
wall
of
immunity,
because
this
is
a
title
dispute,
the
united
states
is
an
indispensable
party.
the
suit
in
the
state
court
is
in
effect
a
suit
against
the
united
states,
which
has
not
consented
to
be
sued.
the
united
states
is
not,
cannot
be
made
and
cannot
become
a
party
in
the
state
court
litigation.
without
the
consent
of
congress,
no
officer
of
the
united
states
has
any
power
to
inject
the
united
states
or
its
property
into
any
court,
whether
it
be
state
or
federal
in
the
posture
of
a
defendant.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
i'm
coming
to
that
in
just
a
moment.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
i
would
like
to
amplify
that
somewhat
here
after
the
conclusion
of
the
outline,
mr.
justice
harlan.
i'm
going
to
deal
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
--
with
it
squarely.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
i
think
you
will
see
when
we
come
to
the
question
about
the
injunction,
the
perfectly
practical
problem
which
is
involved
in
the
irreparable
damage,
which
the
united
states
would
suffer
from
an
adverse
judgment
by
the
state
court.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
it
had
pended
a
few
months
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
it
had
pended
about
seven
months.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
we
had
not
known
of
it
that
long.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
no.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
it
certainly
was.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
well,
now,
on
this
subject
of
the
united
states
getting
into
the
case.
i'm
going
to
have
more
to
say
in
just
a
minute,
but
i
hope
by
this
time
in
this
summary
outline,
we
may
have
seen
the
conclusion
that
the
state
court
has
no
jurisdiction.
on
the
other
hand,
the
federal
court
in
which
the
united
states
is
the
plaintiff,
has
before
it
all
of
the
parties
interested
in
a
full
and
final
adjudication
of
the
title.
and
that
necessarily
means,
that
the
federal
court
has
exclusive
jurisdiction,
while
the
state
court
has
none.
it
is
only
the
protective
arm
of
the
injunction
here
on
review,
which
safeguards
the
government
from
the
eminent
threat
of
inestimable
and
irreparable
damage
to
its
property.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
i'm
going
to
tell
you
what
that
is,
yes,
sir.
most
certainly,
i
will.
at
the
hands
of
an
assailant,
which
has
prevailed
upon
a
state
court
for
plaquemines
parish,
louisiana,
to
assume
a
pretense
of
jurisdiction
to
determine
the
government's
title
behind
its
back,
now,
as
shown
by
the
undisputed
proof
and
as
found
by
the
two
courts
below,
there
can
be
no
question
about
the
eminence
and
the
irreparability
of
the
damage,
which
will
befall
the
property
of
the
united
states
if
the
petitioner
is
allowed
to
proceed
in
the
state
court.
and
as
i
indicated,
mr.
justice
reed,
i
have
considerably
to
say
on
that
subject,
in
a
few
moments.
much
preliminary
argument
is
made
unnecessary
by
the
petitioner's
frank
admission
here
yesterday,
page
30
of
its
brief,
that
in
the
absence
of
the
united
states,
any
decree
made
by
the
state
court
could
not
be
res
judicata
against
the
government.
in
fact,
what
there
is
left
of
the
petitioners
case
after
that
admission,
i
fail
to
see.
if,
as
i
believe,
and
as
the
petitioner
apparently
admits,
no
decree
of
the
state
court
can
bind
the
united
states
or
its
property.
how
can
any
proceeding
in
the
state
court
stand
as
a
bar
to
the
case
in
the
federal
court?
if
what
the
petitioner
wants,
in
good
faith,
is
a
binding
adjudication
of
its
title,
it
would
seem
that
the
petitioner
should
rather
welcome
than
resist
the
progress
of
this
case
in
the
federal
court,
which
alone
can
make
a
binding
determination
of
what
claim
to
title
against
the
united
states.
the
petitioner's
insistence
upon
resisting
the
injunction
here
certainly
suggests
that
there
is
ample
need
for
one.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
now
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
i
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
no.
i
think
his
statement
about
that,
mr.
justice
harlan,
yesterday,
this
statute
part
of
the
315
of
1940
has
been
construed
only
once
in
a
federal
court,
sir,
i
believe
in
the
--
at
least
in
the
context
he
was
speaking
of
yesterday.
and
that
was
by
the
nebo
case
that
i
explained.
that
was
a
case,
which
decided
adversely
to
the
government
on
this
idea
that
there
was
this
outstanding
mineral
reservation
in
perpetuity
with
respect
to
which
the
act
of
1940
could
operate
to
render
imprescriptible
that
which
could
have
been
acquired
previously
only
by
prescription.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
erie,
of
course,
has
to
do
only
with
diversity
cases.
when
this
case
comes
before
a
court
on
the
merits,
it
will
appear
in
this
position.
that
it
is
not
a
construction
of
the
act
of
1940,
which
the
petitioner
desires.
it
is
a
construction
of
a
contract
of
the
united
states
with
relation
to
that
statute.
the
act
can
mean
only
one
thing,
as
its
--
as
i'm
sure
we
can
both
agree.
the
question
is,
whether
that
act
has
any
impact
upon
this
federal
contract.
it
is
not
an
interpretation
of
state
law.
that
act
means
what
it
says.
it
was
aimed
at
uncle
sam's
head
and
it
means
precisely
what
it
says.
there's
no
dispute
about
how
it's
to
be
interpreted.
if
it
may
--
legitimate
to
be
---
they
applied
to
this
federal
contract.does
that
dispose
of
your
question,
mr.
justice
harlan?
mr.
perry
w.
morton
if
i
have
left
that
inference,
i
perhaps
have
done
so
with
a
reason.
in
a
few
moments,
i
will
arrive
at
a
discussion
of
the
propriety
of
the
injunction,
issued
by
the
federal
court
and
the
effect
of
2283
upon
that
question.
but
first
i
want
to
deal
with
this
matter
bearing
upon
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court.
since,
of
course,
the
injunction
itself
is
dependent
upon
at
least
a
preliminary
determination
of
jurisdiction,
as
decided
favorably
to
the
united
states
by
both
courts
below.
now
here,
the
petitioner
argues
principally,
that
the
state
court
case
is
an
action
in
rem
in
a
court
of
coordinate
or
concurrent
jurisdiction
with
the
united
states
district
court
and
all
of
the
petitioner's
conclusions
rest
on
that
premise.
the
most
obvious
of
many
fallacies
in
that
argument
is
that
the
raise,
which
the
petitioner
is
attempting
to
reach,
is
property
as
to
which
the
--
the
united
states
has
both
title
and
possession.
and
parenthetically,
the
state
court
has
never
taken
possession
of.
now,
it
is
well
established
that
a
proceeding
against
property
in
which
the
united
states
has
an
interest
is
a
suit
against
the
united
states,
which
cannot
be
maintained
without
the
consent
of
congress.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
yes.
our
lessee
is
in
possession
operating
80
wells,
as
i'll
disclose
in
just
a
few
minutes.
the
only
course
open
to
the
government,
i
submit,
was
to
bring
its
own
suit
as
plaintiff.
and
that's
what
i
want
to
deal
with
right
now.
it
is
necessarily
a
part
of
the
principle
of
governmental
immunity,
that
without
congressional
consent,
no
officer
of
the
united
states
can
lawfully
intervene
in
any
case
without
--
whether
it
--
defending
in
a
federal
or
a
state
court
makes
no
difference.
if
the
effect
of
such
intervention
is
to
place
the
united
states
in
the
position
of
a
defendant
against
which
affirmative
relief
is
sought.
and
any
such
attempt
to
the
intervention
does
not
bind
the
united
states.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
what
i
said
was
he
could
not
intervene
in
the
posture
of
a
defendant,
as
he
would
necessarily
be
adverse
to
the
interest
of
the
plaintiff
here.
now,
there's
no
doubt
that
you
can
intervene
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
you
can
intervene
affirmatively.
well
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
stanley
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
he
has
tried
it
many
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
stanley,
carr,
minnesota,
shaw,
usf
and
g.
all
of
those
cases
are
cases
in
which
the
officers
of
the
united
states
tried
to
get
in
to
the
position
of
a
defendant
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
usf
and
g.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
those
were
counterclaim
cases.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
i
think
you
wrote
the
opinion.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
no
affirmative
relief
could
be
taken
against
the
united
states.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
that's
right.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
and
of
course
carr
involved
the
--
what
was
it,
the
marine
hospital
at
san
francisco.
stanley
against
schwalby
involved,
before
that
san
antonio
and
so
on.
all
of
those
cases
were
cases
in
which
the
united
states
affirmatively
or
rather
defensively
tried
to
get
in.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
i'm
coming
to
that,
sir?
bank
of
new
york
and
trust
company.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
may
i
discuss
it
with
you
now?
i'd
be
happy
to.
it
was
mentioned
several
times
yesterday.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
bank
of
new
york
and
trust
company
is
the
complete
upside
down
of
this
case.
three
major
distinctions,
i'll
deal
with
them
very
quickly.
in
the
first
place,
the
funds,
which
constituted
the
raise
had
been
in
the
possession
of
either
the
state
court
officers
or
the
depositories
of
the
state
court,
subject
to
the
further
orders
of
the
court
ever
since
eight
years
before
the
united
states
acquired
its
claim
by
assignment
from
the
government
of
russia.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
i
say
that
the
united
states
had
both
title
and
possession
for
years
and
years
before
the
state
court
ever
attempted
to
assume
jurisdiction.
now,
point
two
distinction,
the
suit
by
the
united
states
in
bank
of
new
york
and
trust
company
had
to
fail.
the
suit
was
only
against
the
depository
because
as
this
court
held,
there
were
indispensable
parties
who
were
not
present
and
those
indispensable
parties
were
the
adverse
claimants
to
the
fund.
now,
this
case,
of
course,
is
the
exact
opposite
of
that.
thirdly,
the
united
states
is
not
in
possession
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
we
are
an
adverse
claimant,
certainly,
to
the
plaintiff.
and
so,
therefore,
all
we
can
be
is
a
defendant.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
california
company
is
our
lessee.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
yes,
and
lobrano.
that
is
lobrano
as
the
lessee
and
california
company
is
the
operator
under
the
lessee.
if
i
may
just
quickly
paint
this
last
third
distinction,
the
united
states
wasn't
in
possession
of
the
fund
which
had
been
assigned
to
it
by
russia
in
this
bank
of
new
york
and
trust
company
case.
it
had
only
a
claim
against
a
common
fund
and
in
that
case
the
court
said
if
it
could
and
properly
should
intervene
in
the
state
receivership
proceedings,
liquidation
proceedings,
where
it
would
be
a
plaintiff
seeking
to
enforce
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
yes,
indeed.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
but
in
an
entirely
opposite
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
--
situation
to
the
one,
which
exists
in
this
case,
sir.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
yes.
but
in
the
same
way
that
a
claim
of
the
united
states
may
be
filed,
for
example,
in
a
bankruptcy
court,
where
there
is
a
true
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
--
fund
against
which
people
are
making
affirmative
claims.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
pardon
me?
mr.
perry
w.
morton
are
we
here
from
the
state
court?
mr.
perry
w.
morton
sir,
i
did
not
intervene
in
the
state
action
because
as
i
have
construed
it,
i
am
disabled
from
intervening
without
the
consent
of
congress
as
a
defendant.
and
i
don't
--the
plaintiff
would
be
wise
on
my
part
to
do
a
useless
act.
back
in
new
york
and
trust
now,
i'd
like
to
deal
in
just
a
moment
with
this
law
of
louisiana.
the
petitioner
contends
that
we
are
relegated
to
an
intervention
in
the
state
court.
article
xliii
of
the
code
of
louisiana
practice
is
the
one,
which
governs
the
character
of
this
case.
it
is
the
article
which
the
petitioner
itself
has
invoked.
you'll
find
it
printed
at
the
bottom
of
page
3,
in
the
top
of
page
4
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
if
you
care
to
turn
to
it.
there
at
the
top
of
page
4
in
the
second
paragraph,
you'll
find
in
something
to
this
effect,
that
when
in
such
a
case
in
louisiana
known
as
a
petitory
action.
the
lessee
shall
declare
to
the
plaintiff
the
name
and
address
of
his
lessor.
then
what
happens?
the
lessor,
“shall
be
made
a
party
to
the
suit
and
who
must
defend
it
in
the
place
of
the
tenant,
who
shall
be
discharged
from
the
suit.”
now,
under
those
expressed
words,
how
could
the
united
states
get
into
that
case
except
as
a
defendant?
the
statute
makes
the
petitory
action,
a
title
action.
it
has
been
so
interpreted
consistently
by
the
louisiana
court.
the
petitory
action
has
to
be
brought
by
one
who
is
out
of
possession
against
one
who
is
in
possession.
leiter
qualifies
as
a
plaintiff,
so
far
as
this
point
is
concerned
because
it
is
out
of
possession.
the
united
states
does
not
qualify
as
a
plaintiff
on
this
point
because
it
is
and
long
has
been
in
possession.
i'm
told
by
petitioner's
brief
that
there's
an
article
in
the
louisiana
code
392,
which
says
how
a
petitioner
in
intervention
shall
proceed.
it
does
not
say
that
all
interveners
are
plaintiffs.
and
in
fact,
article
389
of
the
same
code
makes
it
clear
that
interveners
may
also
be
defendants.
and
in
any
event,
in
a
louisiana
petitory
action,
there's
only
one
way
to
get
in,
if
you're
a
lessor
named
by
the
lessee.
and
that
is
as
a
defendant,
you
may
be
a
cited
defendant
or
an
uncited
defendant
but
you
can't
be
an
intervener,
as
such.
now,
in
reference
to
this
louisiana
practice
point,
it
maybe
noted
finally
that
the
particular
judges
who
heard
this
case
in
the
two
courts
below
are
all
along
practiced
in
louisiana
law
and
three
out
of
the
four
of
them
are
members
of
the
louisiana
bar.
they're
in
unanimous
disagreement
with
the
petitioner's
position.
were
it
not
then
for
dependency
of
the
case
in
the
state
court,
the
petitioner
would
surely
have
to
agree
that
the
federal
court
does
have
jurisdiction
over
the
case
presented
by
the
complaint
of
the
united
states
to
quiet
its
title
and
such
jurisdiction
is
specifically
given
by
1345.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
i
say,
except
his
contention
is
that
the
state
court
is
the
only
preclusion.
surely,
he
has
to
admit
that
the
federal
court
has
jurisdiction,
unless
the
state
court
has
jurisdiction.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
all
right.
i'll
deal
with
that
squarely,
right
now.
i'll
turn
immediately
to
this
matter
of
the
propriety
of
the
injunction.
i'll
postpone
momentarily
the
discussion
of
the
eminence
and
the
irreparability
of
the
threatened
damages,
in
order
to
deal
first
with
this
question
of
power.
equity
courts
have
historically
exercised
the
power
in
appropriate
circumstances
to
issue
injunctions
to
preserve
the
status
quo
by
restraining
interference
with
the
subject
matter
of
the
suit.
such
power
in
the
federal
courts
is
generally
recognized
by
the
all
writs
section
of
the
code,
1651
(a).
that
power
exists
in
this
case
unless
it
has
been
taken
away
by
2283.
now,
has
it?
first,
as
demonstrated
by
a
long
line
of
federal
decisions
i
won't
try
the
name.
they're
on
page
37
of
the
government's
brief.
with
none
to
the
contrary,
2283
and
its
predecessors
do
not
apply
to
the
united
states
for
the
reason
that
a
restrictive
statute
will
not
be
applied
to
the
sovereign
without
express
words
to
that
effect.
and
this
court,
in
a
very
similar
situated
--
this
situation
in
the
united
mine
workers.
several
years
ago,
case
was
mentioned
yesterday,
held
very
much
to
the
same
order.
in
that
case,
this
court
was
of
the
opinion
that
the
anti-injunction
provisions
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
did
not
prevent
an
injunction
at
the
suit
of
the
united
states
because
it
did
not
expressly
include
the
united
states.
the
clothing
workers
case
was
also
mentioned
yesterday.
there's
no
doubt
that
you
know
far
more
than
i
do
about
that
case.
it
was
here
just
last
year.
but
there,
the
national
labor
relations
board
was
not
a
party.
the
union
brought
the
suit.
the
united
states
was
not
a
party.
as
i
read
the
case,
the
knob
of
it,
as
far
as
the
leiter
case
is
concerned
is
in
the
third
point
of
the
opinion.
no
relief
except
an
injunction
had
been
sought.
thus,
there
was
no
other
jurisdiction
to
be
aided.
the
leiter
case
is
in
a
wholly
different
situation,
the
preliminary
--
the
primary,
rather,
jurisdiction
invoked
by
the
government
in
the
leiter
case
is
to
quiet
its
title.
the
injunction
is
plainly
proper
within
the
express
words
of
the
statute
as
being
in
aid
of
that
jurisdiction.
the
petitioner
argues
that
the
in
aid
of
its
jurisdiction
clause
of
2283
was
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
federal
courts
removal
jurisdiction,
and
indeed
it
was.
the
petitioner
has
ran
pretty
fast
however,
over
the
first
part
of
the
sentence
in
the
reviser's
code
--
reviser's
note
before
the
word
“and”,
which
says
that
this
phrase
was
added,
“to
conform,”
to
section
1651.
and
what
is
section
1651?
it
is
the
all
writs
section.
now,
having
seen
that
the
section
2283
is
at
least,
in
my
judgment,
no
impediment
to
the
power
of
the
federal
court
to
issue
the
injunction
in
aid
of
its
jurisdiction,
the
next
question
is
concerned
with
the
propriety
of
the
exercise
of
that
power
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
both
courts
below
have
decided
favorably
to
the
united
states
on
the
question,
finding
in
unmistakable
terms
that
if
the
state
court
proceedings
were
permitted
to
come
to
final
judgment,
dispossessing
the
lessees
of
the
united
states
before
the
quiet
title
suit
in
the
federal
court
is
terminated
“both
court
said
this,
“inestimable
and
irreparable
damage
will
result
to
the
united
states
from
the
interruptions
in
the
operation
of
its
lessees.
this
contingency
can
be
avoided
only
by
an
abatement
of
the
state
court
action.”
the
undisputed
proof
in
the
record
supports
this
conclusion
as
to
the
irreparability
of
the
damage.
now,
while
mr.
marshall,
representing
the
california
company
is
better
or
best
versed
than
i
and
i
want
to
reserve
some
time
for
him
in
the
technical
aspects
of
the
operations
of
this
oil
field.
and
i'm
sure
we'll
have
more
to
say
on
that
subject.
it
is
clear
from
this
record
that
any
interruption
whatsoever,
even
for
a
few
hours
in
the
operation
of
this
field
will
result
in
a
large
permanent
loss
of
recoverable
oil.
many
of
these
wells
are
being
produced
under
a
so-called
pressure
injection
method.
any
stoppage
will
cause
wells
to
become
water
flooded
and
sand
loaded.
when
this
case
began
in
march
of
1954,
the
first
well
having
been
completed
as
recently
as
january
of
1950,
there
were
already
80
producing
wells
and
there
had
already
been
a
gross
production
of
$28
million
worth
of
oil.
i
am
advised
that
there
are
now
more
than
90
wells
and
that
the
gross
production
has
passed
$61
million.
the
permanent
loss
of
even
a
momentary
shut
down
would
obviously
be
inestimable.
now,
what
was
the
eminence
of
this
damage
occurring
when
the
united
states
was
first
advised
the
dependency
of
the
case
in
the
state
court,
seeking
to
try
its
title
behind
its
back.
the
state
court
had
already
taken
submission
of
the
arguments
on
the
exceptions
of
the
california
company.
in
federal
practice
we
would
call
those
exceptions
a
motion
to
dismiss.
and
it
was
about
to
decide
the
issue.
indeed,
the
first
restraining
order
was
issued
by
the
federal
court
on
the
last
day
that
the
california
company
had
to
answer
in
the
state
court,
after
the
court
had
overruled
its
exceptions.
if
the
state
court
had
been
permitted
to
proceed
to
judgment,
as
it
could
and
likely
would
in
the
immediately
near
future
the
execution
of
a
judgment
for
possession
under
louisiana
law
would
require
that
the
sheriff,
aided
by
a
posse
comitatus
place
the
petitioner
here
in
possession
by
force
if
necessary.
the
only
alternative
would
be
a
suspensive
appeal,
in
which
a
bond
would
be
required
in
an
amount
which
under
louisiana
law,
as
to
the
formula
for
the
figuring
of
it,
might
run
as
high
as
$100
million
based
upon
the
figures
i
have
already
given.
now,
on
that
state
of
facts,
what
was
the
predicament
of
the
united
states?
it
could
not
enter
the
state
court
case.
it
had
no
control
whatsoever
over
that
litigation.
obviously,
in
properly
representing
the
interest
of
the
united
states,
there
is
a
vast
difference
between
cheering
from
the
sidelines
of
a
contest
between
other
parties,
on
the
one
hand,
and
having
active
control
as
a
quarterback
of
its
own
contest.
it
does
not
do
to
say
that
the
california
company
might
and
probably
would
take
an
appeal
and
post
the
bond.certainly,
there
was
no
means
by
which
the
united
states
could
either
direct
its
action
or
furnish
the
bond
for
it.
i
do
not
even
know
whether
the
mineral
lessee
could
post
such
a
bond
and
we
have
no
way
of
being
assured
that
it
would.
i
submit
that
under
those
circumstances,
only
one
proper
course
lay
open
to
a
responsible
official
of
the
federal
government
and
that
happened
to
be
me.
and
that
was
to
protect
the
interest
of
the
united
states
as
a
legal
matter
and
as
a
practical
matter
by
bringing
this
case
in
the
--
for
the
government
to
quiet
its
own
title,
and
pending
the
determination
of
that
case
to
seek
to
preserve
the
status
quo
and
the
integrity
of
the
government's
property
by
an
injunction.
in
such
a
situation,
it
is
idle
to
talk
about
not
issuing
an
injunction
because
of
a
policy
to
avoid
unseemly
conflict
between
courts.
indeed
the
denial
of
the
injunction
would
only
have
served
to
promote
conflict
of
a
more
aggravated
sort
at
a
latter
stage.
the
present
injunction,
timely
extinguishes
a
spark
which,
otherwise,
might
spread
into
a
blaze.
finally,
i
wish
to
emphasize
that
the
question
here
is
not
one
which
arises
from
a
conflict
of
federal
courts,
these
are
the
state
courts.
precisely,
the
same
principles
would
be
involved
if
upon
some
basis,
leiter
had
brought
its
action
in
the
same
federal
court.
the
united
states
being
disabled
from
entering
such
case
voluntarily
or
involuntarily
as
a
defendant
for
the
same
reasons
already
given
would
have
to
resort
to
its
own
separate
case
as
plaintiff
and
move
for
a
stay
of
the
other
case.
and
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
marshall
would
conclude
the
arguments
for
the
respondents,
representing
the
california
company.
