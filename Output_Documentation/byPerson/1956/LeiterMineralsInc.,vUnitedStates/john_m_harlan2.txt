could
you
have
gone
into
the
state
litigation?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
removed
it
to
the
federal
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
go
ahead.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
i
got
a
somewhat
--
in
different
impression.
now,
i
understood
it,
the
statute,
louisiana
statute
as
the
petitioner
claims
is
the
foundation
of
this
case,
has
been
construed
adversely
in
his
contention
in
the
federal
courts.
now,
i
assume
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
is
that
not
so?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
in
all
events
the
court,
in
the
nebo
case,
i
understood
him
to
say
that
he
wanted
to
go
into
the
state
courts
to
get
adjudication
of
the
state
courts
on
that
statute,
which
then
under
erie,
he
thought
would
be
binding
on
the
federal
courts.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
quite
legitimate.proper
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
only
realized
it
because
i
got
the
implication
from
what
you
were
saying,
that
you
were
suggesting
there
were
some
--
something
improper
or
--
or
reason,
something
that
didn't
meet
the
eye
on
these
people
going
into
the
state
court.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
would
you
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
was
the
nature
of
you
demurrer,
whatever
it
was
under
your
practice
to
the
complaint?
