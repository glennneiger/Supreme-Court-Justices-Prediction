justice

but
you
were
--
you
were
successful
of
the
state
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
substantively.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
effect
would
this
have
on
this
suit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
--
excuse
me.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
the
interpretation
of
this
louisiana
statute
is
crucial
in
an
ultimate
dispute
between
the
united
states
at
your
client?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then,
what
you
are
saying,
i
guess
is,
that
am
i
right
or
wrong
i
think
i
get
what
you
said
last.
a
judgment
wouldn't
--
could
not
be
pleaded
as
res
judicata.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
they're
not
a
party.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
were
give
a
particular
interpretation
to
the
statute
in
your
lawsuit,
do
you
think
that
the
erie-tompkins
doctrine
would
compel
the
federal
courts
to
respect
that
interpretation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
of
course,
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
but
that
--
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
that
should
be
the
real
point
you
have.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
the
statute
filed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
there's
no
raise
here.
they
take
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
does
it
follow
that
you
could
be
evicted
even
if
the
--
this
particular
injunction
was
not
issued?
why
does
it
follow
that
the
work
could
be
stopped?
why
would
--
why
could
you
not
--
if
--
if
the
court
--
can
we
know
that
the
court
would
attempt
to
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
act
on
that
assumption
and
if
that
be
true
that
the
government
has
in
average,
why
it
could
not
then
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
the
order
in
that
manner
and
avoid
the
damage?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
did
decide
it
maybe
--
i
--
i'm
asking
question
for
information
because
i
don't
know.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
did
decide
the
merits
against
you
and
suppose
the
federal
court,
you
should
--
the
government
should
go
into
the
federal
court
or
some
other
court
and
get
an
injunction
against
that
enforcing
it
on
the
ground
that
the
government's
right
would
be
effective.
could
the
case
then
go
on
to
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
to
decide
the
point
that
--
points
on
the
merits
that
it'd
been
adjudicated
in
the
state
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
a
different
point.
but
the
point
i
was
asking
was
to
find
out
why
you
and
your
associates
say
that
it
must
now
be
held
that
you
would
suffer
irreparable
damages
by
an
(inaudible)
which
possibly
might
never
be
an
issue
and
which
if
issued
--
if
you're
entitled
to
restrain
it,
could
you
restrain
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
the
point
--
i
was
trying
to
get
the
light
on
then
--
maybe
its
--
they're
clear
--
is
that
you
are
asking
now,
for
an
injunction
and
claiming
that
your
damages
would
result
by
reason
of
something
that
has
not
yet
happened,
might
not
happen,
even
if
the
case
is
decided
against
them.
moreover,
why
could
you
not
at
that
time
get
a
restraining
order
to
prevent
that
kind
of
execution
of
the
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
might
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
haven't
been
yet
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
law
--
does
the
law
of
louisiana
provide
that
an
order
shall
issue
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
three
days
notice
to
whom?
justice
hugo
l.
black
three
days
notice
to
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
the
federal
--
could
the
united
states
or
a
property
owner
under
these
circumstances,
of
course,
were
not
the
united
states,
go
into
the
state
court
of
louisiana
and
file
a
separate
suit
to
remove
the
cloud
from
title
of
the
same
nature
that
has
been
filed
in
the
federal
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
might
be,
but
why
could
the
united
states
not
go
in
there
through
the
attorney
general,
who
has
general
authority
to
go
in
any
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
protect
the
government's
interest.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can
say
that
the
--
this
action
if
it's
allowed
to
continue
to
its
end,
will
create
a
cloud
on
my
title
and
that
--
that
somewhere
we've
got
to
have
this
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
had
in
this
case
several
years
ago
and
i'm
asking
you
because
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i'm
--
my
mind
is
not
at
rest
at
all
on
the
case.
we
had
a
case
several
years
ago
whether
there
was
a
question
of
title
in
illinois
and
after
we
heard
the
argument,
we
decided
that
such
--
there
was
a
preliminary
question
of
state
law
to
be
determined
of
rather
some
deputizing
that
we
would
send
it
back
and
give
a
chance
to
have
that
litigated
in
the
state
court.
now,
if
the
--
if
this
statute
needs
to
be
construed
according
to
its
meaning,
without
regard
to
whether
it
might
raise
a
constitutional
question
and
so
forth
and
if
we
need
the
determination
of
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
to
decide
what
the
statute
means
in
that
state,
how
do
you
distinguish
the
magnolia
petroleum
case
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
that
on
the
merits
they
have
no
case?
