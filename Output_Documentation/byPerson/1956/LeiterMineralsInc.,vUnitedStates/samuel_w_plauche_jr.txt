mr.

what
the
--
this
is
a
review
of
an
interlocutory
order
of
injunction
issued
by
the
district
court
below
and
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
fifth
circuit.
the
fundamental
question
presented
is
whether
or
not
the
district
court's
order
was
authorized
improper,
despite
the
federal
anti-injunction
statute,
and
in
the
face
of
the
rule
of
committee
which
prevents
the
district
court
or
prevented
it
as
we
say
from
interfering
with
previously
acquired
and
subsisting
in
rem
jurisdiction
of
petitioner's
suit
which
was
pending
in
a
state
court
of
louisiana.
the
brief
history
of
the
litigation
is
this.
in
august
of
1953,
petitioner
brought
its
petitory
action
in
a
state
court
of
louisiana
in
--
in
for
plaquemines
parish.
the
court
there
was
a
court
of
general
or
plenary
jurisdiction
of
the
state.
it
was
a
petitory
action
brought
by
petitioner
claiming
recognition
of
its
right
entitled
to
the
mineral
rights
which
underlay
some
8700
acres
of
marsh
land
in
plaquemines
parish.
it
was
brought,
as
it
was
authorized
to
do
and
as
it
was
expressly
required
by
louisiana
practice
to
do
against
those
parties
in
possession
of
the
mineral
rights,
the
california
company
and
a
man
named
lobrano,
who,
it
was
alleged
by
petitioner
were
wrongfully
withholding
the
possession
of
petitioner's
rights
from
petitioner
and
the
possession
was
alleged
to
on
behalf
of
petitioner
to
have
been
unlawful.
it
is
true
that
the
claim
by
petitioner
in
the
state
court
rested
upon
its
claim
of
--
its
right
to
recognition
of
its
title
to
the
minerals.
promptly
upon
the
suit
having
been
brought
in
accordance
--
strict
accordance
of
the
court
of
louisiana
procedure,
the
defendants,
california
company
and
lobrano,
undertook
to
remove
the
case
to
the
federal
court
in
and
for
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana.
petitioner
filed
a
motion
to
remand
which
was
granted
by
judge
wright
who
later
issued
the
injunction
which
is
under
review
here.
judge
wright
--
it
was
removed
on
the
ostensible
ground
that
there
was
a
federal
question
presented
by
petitioner's
state
court
complaint.
judge
wright
in
remanding
said,
“there
may
be
a
federal
question
lurking
in
the
background,
but
it
is
not
sufficiently
disclosed
--
disclosed
by
petitioner's
state
court
complaint
and
at
present
is
not
a
substantial
one.”
upon
the
remand
to
the
state
court,
the
california
company
and
lobrano
who
claimed
under
leases
from
the
united
states,
joined
the
issue
with
petitioner.
they
challenged
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court.
they
claimed
that
united
states
which
was
in
effect
they
say
being
sued
was
an
indispensable
party.
it
had
withheld
its
consent
and
couldn't
be
sued
and
also
and
finally,
that
the
state
court
petition
claiming
the
right
to
the
possession
of
the
minerals
being
wrongfully
withheld,
we
say,
disclosed
no
claim
for
legal
relief.
in
other
words,
that
our
suit,
even
if
everything
we
said
was
true
and
all
the
documents
that
were
attached
were
admitted
as
they
read,
we
had
no
cause
from
a
substantive
stand
point.
those
issues
went
before
the
district
judge
in
the
state
court,
judge
bruce
nunez.
they
were
exhaustively
briefed
and
argued
orally.
and
ultimately,
sometime
later
in
march
of
1954,
he
overruled
all
of
the
defendant's
defenses
and
held
in
effect
that
petitioner's
case
was
sound,
both
procedurally
and
substantively.
six
days
before
he
ruled
this
present
action
in
which
this
interlocutory
order
under
review
was
issued,
was
commenced
by
the
united
states
in
the
federal
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana.
this
is
an
action
claiming
on
behalf
of
the
united
states,
title
to
the
same
minerals,
seeking
to
erase
and
cancel
petitioner's
muniments
of
title
which
are
of
record
and
asking,
and
this
is
what
is
at
issue
here,
and
praying
for
a
temporary
injunction
against
petitioner's
prosecution
of
its
state
court
action.
immediately
upon
judge
nunez's
order,
a
ruling
in
the
state
court
coming
down
six
days
after
the
suit
commenced.
the
united
states
prayed
for
and
obtained
a
temporary
restraining
order
restraining
any
further
prosecution
that
without
notice
of
the
state
court
action.
petitioner
met
this
federal
court
action
for
the
injunctive
relief
by
a
motion
based
on
three
grounds,
the
motion
to
dismiss
or
rebate.
first,
on
the
ground
that
it
was
argued
prohibited
by
the
federal
anti-injunction
statute.
second,
that
it
interfered
with
the
previously
acquired
in
rem
or
quasi
in
rem
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court
over
the
reese
and
that
the
state
court
had
been
resorted
to
first,
some
seven
months
before
this
injunction
suit
was
filed.
and
finally,
and
in
the
alternative
that
since
petitioner's
claim
that
the
minerals
was
based
squarely
and
entirely
upon
an
act
of
the
louisiana
legislature,
act
315
of
1940
which
i
should
come
to
in
a
moment.
and
since
the
--
the
claim
of
petitioner
based
upon
that
act
would
involve
or
might
well
involve
substantial
federal
constitutional
questions
and
since
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
louisiana
had
not
rendered
a
definitive
interpretation
of
the
statute
against
such
a
federal
case,
that
this
court
--
that
the
federal
court,
meaning
the
district
court
that
should
stay
at
hand
or
abstain
from
deciding
prematurely
such
a
federal
constitutional
question
under
what
has
aptly
has
been
termed
by
your
honors,
the
doctrine
of
extension.
those
issues
were
presented
to
the
district
court,
briefed
and
argued
and
taken
under
advisement
and
judge
wright
after
considering,
denied
petitioner's
motion
and
entered
a
temporary
injunction
prayed
for.
on
appeal
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed.
the
decision
of
the
court
below,
both
courts
below
based
on
the
proposition
as
contended
for
by
the
government
and
by
the
other
respondents
that
the
federal
court
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
petitioner's
claim
of
the
united
states
claim
for
it
--
for
the
property
which
is
the
same
reason
that's
in
controversy
in
the
previously
filed
state
court.
that
the
state
court
had
no
jurisdiction
whatsoever
and
further,
that
the
united
states
was
an
indispensable
party
to
the
state
court
litigation
which
had
previously
been
filed
by
petitioner
and
which
now
stands
enjoined.
the
crucial
and
the
chronological
facts
leading
up
to
the
legal
questions
of
which
are
involved
are
these.
in
1935,
an
option
was
granted
by
the
trustees
of
the
estate
of
joseph
leiter,
deceased,
to
the
united
states
covering
this
8711
acres
of
marsh
land
in
louisiana
for
the
future
or
--
or
a
possible
future
purpose
of
a
migratory
bird
sanctuary
or
refuge.
in
that
preliminary
act
which
is
not
--
was
not
recorded,
that
was
the
mineral
reservation
that
in
the
event,
the
option
was
exercised
and
in
the
event
the
deal
was
made
or
consummated
the
minerals
would
be
reserved
under
certain
terms.
in
1938,
december
of
1938,
thomas
leiter,
the
sole
heir
of
joseph
leiter,
deceased,
actually
made
the
deed,
executed
the
deed
and
--
and
consummated
the
deal
and
reserved
the
minerals
under
the
land
which
of
them
--
which
is
the
reason
in
controversy
here,
for
an
expressed
term
of
10
years.
now,
if
i
may
digress
just
a
moment.
under
the
law
of
louisiana,
that
the
grant
of
reservation
of
minerals,
creates
non-ownership
of
those
minerals
as
specific
things
apart
from
the
soil
which
they
underlie
but
under
the
law
of
louisiana,
the
civil
law,
that
concept
of
property.
it
creates
merely
a
servitude
or
an
easement
or
--
or
a
right
to
go
and
explore
for
and
produce
those
minerals
which
may
underlie
the
land,
which
servitude
a
reason
if
not
exercised
for
10
years,
expires
by
a
prescription
or
a
limitation.
in
1940,
a
year
and
a
half
after
thomas
leiter
made
his
reservation
when
he
made
his
deed
to
the
government
of
minerals
for
10
years,
the
legislature
of
louisiana
passed
act
315
of
--
of
that
year,
providing
and
your
--
if
your
honors
care
to
read
it
that
the
--
the
1940
act
is
quoted
verbatim,
page
45,
appendix
(a)
in
the
petitioner's
brief.
it's
very
short,
“providing
that
where
minerals
are
reserved
in
a
deed
to
the
united
states
affecting
land
in
louisiana
and
the
minerals
are
reserved,
such
mineral
rights
shall
be
imprescriptible.”
in
other
words,
they
--
they
will
not
as
--
as
were
ordered
otherwise
or
were
previously
would
have
happened.
they
will
not
expire
for
none
use
or
exercise,
but
they
will
remain
permanently
in
the
reserve
order.
now,
judge
nunez
had
this
issue
before
and
in
the
state
court
before
he
was
restrained.
he
decided
in
favor
of
petitioner
on
the
question
of
the
merit,
you
see
because
the
california
company
and
lobrano
had
put
an
issue,
not
only
the
procedure
aspects
but
also
the
--
the
merit
of
petitioner's
claim
which
was
expressly
fixed
upon
the
act
of
1940.
he
took
a
middle
ground
which
was
something
like
this.
the
act
--
the
reservation
as
i
have
stated
and
if
your
honors
care
to
make
a
note
where
the
reservation
appears
in
extent
so
it's
page
46
of
petitioner's
brief.
the
reservation
in
three
parts,
in
three
separate
places
reserves
those
minerals
for
10
years
which
is
what
the
term
would
have
been
for
minerals
in
an
ordinary
reservation,
but
for
the
act
of
1940.
there's
another
terminal
data
from
which
respondents
rely
on
the
merits
which
of
course
are
not
really
at
issue
here.
the
--
in
the
first
circuit
set
ups
of
the
reserving
clause,
it
is
provided
that
the
right
of
inquiry
for
these
minerals
will
terminate
or
expire
on
april
1st,
1945.
remember,
this
is
now
the
5th
of
19
--
december
1938
deed,
six
and
a
half
years
after
the
execution
of
the
deed
in
the
reservation.
there
is
this
seeming
inconsistent
expiration
date.
judge
nunez
concluded
from
the
language
of
the
deed
and
from
the
effect
of
the
act
that
the
earliest
and
you
can
see
the
inconsistent
terminal
date
or
cutoff
date
related
only
to
the
right
of
inquiry.
it
didn't
affect
the
reservation
of
the
minerals
as
a
whole
and
he
said
that
as
to
the
mineral
reservation
at
of
the
whole
which
was
expressly
for
10
years,
the
act
of
1940
suspended
that
prescription
and
made
imprescriptible
petitioner's
rights.
well
no
respondents
really
make
fun
of
petitioner's
contention
on
the
merits,
although
those
again
are
not
here
before
your
honors.
they
say
it
would
be
absurd
to
say
that
you'd
a
right
to
enter
or
--
or
explore
for
minerals
if
you
didn't
have
a
right
to
enter
and
explore
for
minerals,
but
that's
not
absurd
at
all.
if
i'm
--
i'm
still
digressing
on
the
merits
because
respondents
you
see
make
or
take
great
issue
with
us
and
present
the
merits
of
the
case
and
it
does
here
only
on
review
of
an
interlocutory
order
of
injunction,
but
we
feel
that
we
should
at
least
present
the
issues
not
to
your
honor
to
show
that
judge
had
--
nunez
had
questions
of
substance
before
you,
substance
in
deciding
and
in
petitioner's
favor.
and
so,
it
gives
weight
to
petitioner's
claims
that
--
of
--
of
title
and
the
right
to
recover
the
wrongfully
withheld
possession
that
is
certainly
not
a
capricious
or
fictitious
claim.
judge
nunez
in
holding
that
the
right
of
entry
only
expires
and
that
the
right
to
the
minerals
themselves
were
reserved
and
made
imprescriptible
is
entirely
consistent
with
what
is
known
in
the
industry
as
directional
drilling.
as
--
as
your
honors
no
doubt,
has
known
for
many
years
it
has
been
possible
to
explore
a
point,
produce
mines
and
minerals
and
from
the
pegasus
type
without
ever
entering
the
premises
at
all.
the
science
had
developed
for
years
to
such
an
extent
that
even
though
no
entry
at
all
in
the
premises
to
which
the
mineral
rights
apply
--
mineral
rights
apply
is
made.
you
may
make
a
surface
location
and
deviate
from
the
vertical
directionally
as
to
angles
up
to
45
degrees
and
for
distances
along
the
horizontal
plane
for
distances
in
excess
of
a
mile.
so,
it
would
be
entirely
consistent
to
say
as
judge
nunez
did,
taking
in
an
--
a
contract
interpretation
approach
here,
that
the
right
of
entry
expired,
but
the
expressed
reservation
of
the
minerals
for
10
years
was
effective
and
the
legislature
of
louisiana
made
it
imprescriptible
in
an
act
which
was
a
validly
an
exercise
of
the
public
policy
of
the
state
to
preserve
the
minerals
for
its
citizens.
with
that,
the
status
of
the
case
when
the
restraining
order
was
granted,
there
had
been
a
decision
in
the
state
court
in
this
in
rem
or
quasi
in
rem
suit
and
it'd
been
a
decision
favorable
to
petitioner
and
that
entire
litigation
is
now
enjoined
at
the
hands
of
the
district
court
and
that
has
received
the
approval
of
the
circuit
court
for
three
reasons
which
we
urge
in
our
motion.
it
is
submitted
by
petitioner
that
the
order
below
was
incorrect.
at
the
threshold,
the
injunction
was
forbidden
by
the
anti-injunction
statute
which
i
think
if
your
honors
want
to
refer
to
in
its
extreme
degree,
you're
familiar
with
it,
i'm
sure.
it's
on
page
3
of
petitioner's
brief.
it's
now
--
since
1948,
section
22-83
of
title
28
of
the
united
states
code
and
it
reads,
“a
code
of
the
united
states
may
not
stay
proceedings
in
the
state
court,
except
as
of
--
expressly
authorized
by
an
act
of
congress
or
where
necessary
in
aid
of
its
jurisdiction
or
to
protect
or
effectuate
its
judgments.”
of
the
three
exceptions
that
are
carved
out
of
it
by
the
expressed
language
of
the
--
of
2283,
two
may
be
laid
aside
immediately.
first,
there
is
no
congressional
authorization
to
the
injunction
below,
respondent's
point
denied.
there
is
no
judgment
which
is
attempted
that
is
beneath
this
issue
it
signed
or
executed
which
it
attempted
to
be
protected
or
effectuated.
similarly,
the
phrase,
the
third
exception
where
necessary
in
aid
of
its
jurisdiction
will
not
comfort
or
aid
respondents
here.
the
purpose
of
the
phrase
in
aide
of
its
jurisdiction
was
included
in
the
1948
revision
of
the
code.
according
to
the
expressed
reviser's
note,
“to
make
it
conform
to
another
section
of
the
judicial
code
and
to
make
clear,
the
court
--
the
federal
court's
recognized
power
to
stay
state
court
proceedings
in
cases
removed
to
it,
under
the
removal
procedure.
further,
if
as
respondents
say,
that
phrase
of
--
of
--
in
aid
of
its
jurisdiction,
if
that
were
to
supersede
or
allow
it
to
overcome
the
anti-injunction
law
on
--
on
the
ground
that
since
the
federal
court
has
general
jurisdiction
of
claims
brought
by
the
united
states,
if
it
completely
in
all
respect
supersede
the
anti-injunction
law,
because
the
language
of
the
--
of
13-45
which
confer
it
generally
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
courts
to
in
cases
brought
by
united
states
is
exactly
phrased
as
is
the
regular
diversity
jurisdiction
or
in
cases
of
general
federal
questions
or
as
in
13-37,
cases
arising
under
any
act
of
congress
which
regulates
commerce
between
the
states.
so,
if
we
were
to
say
that
merely
because
the
united
states
courts
have
--
have
general
jurisdiction,
not
exclusive
of
the
suits
brought
to
the
united
states,
if
that
were
to
be
allowed
to
--
to
overcome
the
anti-injunction
law,
then
you
have
no
anti-injunction
statute
at
all
because
the
--
the
act
of
conferring
general
jurisdiction
on
the
federal
court
in
cases
brought
by
the
government
is
in
the
same
language
as
all
of
the
other
is
executed
of
jurisdiction
upon
the
district
court.
and
your
honors,
we
say,
held
that
very
thing
in
a
case
which
is
if
not
precisely
the
same
because
the
parties
weren't
the
same
is
entirely
parallel
in
its
reasoning
and
as
--
in
as
to
its
subject
matter
last
year
in
--
in
amalgamated
clothing
workers
versus
--
versus
richmond
brothers,
where
although
the
united
states
do
not
bear
a
party.
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
was
invoked
under
an
act
that
conferring
jurisdiction
upon
the
united
states
courts
under
13-37,
an
act
or
an
action
arising
on
an
act
of
congress
relating
to
commerce
between
the
states.
and
the
injunction
sought
for
the
federal
court
in
richmond
sought
to
stay
a
state
court
proceeding
where
not
only
was
it
asserted
that
the
state
court
had
no
jurisdiction,
your
honors
held
or
assumed
that
the
state
court
had
no
jurisdiction
and
that
the
state
court
was
there
invading
an
exclusive
federally
created
domain
of
--
of
labor
relations
as
governed
by
the
taft-hartley
law.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
sir?
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
in
our
case,
your
honor?
no,
sir,
we
--
we
--
and
as
we
could
not
have
done
so.
we
have
as
pointed
out
in
those
little
subsequent
portion
of
our
argument,
we
have
suggested
the
prescription
of
a
formula
set
up
by
an
earlier
decision
of
your
honors
in
1936,
suggesting
that
the
united
states
intervene
as
an
actor,
a
plaintiff
suing
in
its
own
rights
in
the
state
court
to
assert
whatever
interest
it
may
have,
but
it
is
not
a
party
and
no
attempt
has
been
made.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
sir?
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
in
our
--
you're
talking
about
that
case?
they
--
they
so
claimed
and
we
allege
that
they
did
on
information
and
belief,
although
none
of
the
documents
are
in
the
record.
we
now
know
from
documents
they've
introduced
in
court
that
they
are
claiming
under
a
color
of
right
or
lease
from
the
united
states,
according
to
the
same
documents,
claims
of
the
title
of
the
property.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
your
honor,
i'll
be
glad
to
answer
that.
we
want
the
state
court
to
go
on,
state
court
case.
and
our
reasons
if
--
if
i
may
articulate
them
or
something
akin
to
the
reasons
--
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
yes.
no,
no,
sir.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
oh
i
--
no,
i
--
i'd
be
pleased
to
answer.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
yes.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
i'd
rather
be
pleased
to
answer.
but
for
one
thing,
we're
a
simple
law
state,
it
--
unique
in
--
from
all
the
other
states
in
the
--
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
not,
but
one
of
eight
in
our
fifth
circuit
as
a
louisiana
lawyer,
if
your
honor
pleases.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
well,
sir,
i
don't
want
to
take
a
chance
on
their
being
uneducated.
if
the
court
please,
i
--
i'll
say
i'm
imperilled
by
--
and
i
think
basically
by
the
same
reasons
that
activate
the
court
here
to
refuse
to
reach
for
state
constitutional
questions
before
a
state
final
court
has
passed
or
interpreted
an
act
which
is
an
issue
and
put
to
the
constitutional
test.
we
would
like
to
have
our
1940
act
to
prove
which
our
claim
solely
relies,
pass
upon
at
least
first
by
a
state
supreme
court.
if
we
lose
there,
we'll
just
have
to
take
our
licking
in
as
good
race
as
we
can,
but
i
think
that's
really
are
the
basic
motivation
i
have.
and
if
the
court
please,
referring
again
briefly
for
a
moment
to
the
--
what
was
a
threat,
special
obstacle
to
this
injunction,
the
22-83.
it
is
true
that
there
are
a
number
of
lower
court
federal
decisions
which
are
contrary
to
the
argument
that
i
have
just
advanced.
they
commenced
in
1923
in
a
district
court
decision
from
washington
and
that
it
--
there
--
it
has
--
the
error
has
been
perpetuated
several
times
since.
the
--
we
have
a
response
of
course
cited.
in
fact,
on
this,
and
we've
cited
a
few.
our
list
is
more
complete
than
theirs.
we
will
check
it
and
because
we
want
all
of
those
decisions
to
come
to
light
because
we
think
that
they're
basically
erroneous
and
typically
demonstrated
to
be
so
and
since
your
honors'
decision
last
year
in
richmond
which
to
our
way
of
looking
at
it
reaffirmed
the
position
of
this
court
on
the
anti-injunction
statute
with
the
--
that's
up
15
years
ago
in
toucey
versus
new
york
life.
we
--
if
we
see
the
decision,
this
court
will
nor
permit
a
judicial
departure
from
the
clear-cut
prohibition
of
the
anti-injunction
statute,
nor
will
you
accept
the
argument
which
respondents
made
that
in
--
in
the
1948
revision
say,
accepted
the
--
the
judicial
gloss
of
this
other
erroneous
decision
and
that
they
became
part
and
parcel
of
what's
established
of
the
anti-injunction
law.
well,
your
honors,
so
completely
rejected
that
in
the
toucey
case
where
you
disapproved
a
long
and
--
and
much
earlier
and
much
more
dignified
set
of
decisions
from
this
very
court
and
said
that
actually
silence
of
the
congress
was
not
to
be
construed
as
more
powerful
than
its
own
expressed
clear-cut
prohibition.
so,
we
ask
you.
we've
listened,
set
the
cases
up
and
we
asked
your
honor
to
disapprove
them.
finally,
with
the
respondents
rely
in
--
in
trying
to
overcome
which
to
us
is
a
clear-cut
prohibition
against
this
injunction.
the
ancient
rule
that
whether
the
united
states
is
not
named
in
--
in
a
statute
which
seeks
to
divest
persons
of
rights,
that
the
old
ancient
rule
that
the
sovereign
shall
not
be
governed
or
controlled
unless
you'd
expressed
and
they
avert
to
that,
but
that
rule
is
really
inapplicable
to
this
statute.
the
anti-injunction
statute
doesn't
run
to
persons
and
divest
persons
of
rights.
it
didn't
say
who
may
or
who
may
not
apply
for
a
federal
court
injunction.
it
prohibits
the
federal
courts
from
issuing
any
injunction.
if
--
there's
no
question
of
what
class
of
person
shall
be
affected.
it's
the
court
that
is
deprived
and
completely
divested
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
well,
sir,
it
--
it
does.
it
deserves
--
brought
our
comment,
i
should
say.
it
--
it
deserves
comment
at
any
rate.
i
do
not
--
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
i
--
i
have
--
it
--
it's
in
the
brief.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
and
if
the
court
please.
of
all
of
the
members
of
the
court
who
expressed
himself
specifically
on
the
question
and
of
course
there
has
been
now
norris-laguardia
prohibition
running
in
2803.
you
said
that
even
despite
some
language
in
the
norris
laguardia
act,
which
the
majority
concurred
in
by
three
said,
“necessarily
excluded
the
united
states
from
its
operation,”
four
--
four
of
the
members
of
the
court
held
the
evil
with
that
preclusion
here
in
language
if
i
may
say.
the
--
the
court
was
still
deprived
and
divested
of
jurisdiction.
the
majority
which
was
concurred
in
by
three
members
in
the
united
(inaudible)
was
not
content
to
rest
its
decision
on
the
question
of
injunction
upon
this
ancient
in
a
rule
of
the
sovereign
not
being
included,
were
not
mentioned.
they
--
they
expressed
that
we
--
we
--
this
is
not
enough.
so
then,
they
went
on
to
point
out
that
the
language
of
the
act,
the
norris
laguardia
act
inevitably
made
the
prohibition
there
applicable
to
the
united
states.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
that's
--
that's
true,
your
honor,
and
it
doesn't
say,
“of
the
members
who
expressed
themselves
on
the
precise
point,”
more
agreed
with
the
contention
that
i've
just
made
than
--
than
otherwise
expressed
themselves
to
the
contrary.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
if
the
court
please,
i
--
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
well,
i
--
i'll
be
happy
to
discuss
briefly
the
situation
of
it,
the
background.
the
--
the
anti-injunction
statute,
of
course,
was
designed
and
in
--
since
--
in
1793,
it
has
been
designed
in
slightly
varying
lengths
to
avoid
these
direct
collisions,
which
we
say
is
presented
here,
a
direct
collision
between
courts,
if
not
necessarily
--
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
if
the
court
please,
it's
not
necessarily
so.
i
--
i'm
--
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
--
not
necessarily
so.
if
the
nature
of
the
actions
is
such
that
--
that
only
one
court
can
proceed
to
a
final
adjudication
if
the
nature
of
the
action
is
in
rem
or
quasi
in
rem
which
is
the
second
point
i'm
getting
to.
then,
actually
jurisdiction
over
all
the
parties
in
each
case
is
not
necessary,
a
criterion.
in
other
words,
the
parties
need
not
be
identical,
particularly
whereas
here,
we
could
not
make
the
parties
identical
because
we
couldn't
sue
the
united
states
in
the
state
court.
it
--
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
well,
if
the
court
please,
i
know
that
[laughs]
and
so
far
--
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
i'm
now
coming
to
that
end.
here,
we
have
a
--
a
--
the
two
types
of
cases,
a
state
court
case
and
a
subsequent
federal
case,
the
nature
of
which
is
such
that
only
one
of
the
suits
can
proceed
to
final
judgment
because
only
one
of
the
--
the
--
the
two
sets,
of
course,
can
proceed
to
adjudicate
and
effectuate
its
decree
in
order
to
give
relief.
the
rule
that
the
reese
cases
which
we
have
--
which
is
our
second
point
and
which
is
really
is
--
is
a
fundamental
question.
it
--
it's
been
recognized
by
this
court
for
120
years
since
hagan
versus
lucas
was
decided.
it
is
no
test
of
the
reese
doctrine
which
is
i
say,
has
been
for
almost
a
--
a
century
and
a
quarter
that
the
reese,
be
in
custodia
legis
or
be
currently
under
seizure.
it
is
just
--
the
test
is
whether
or
not
in
the
action,
it
will
ultimately
become
necessary
to
control
or
dispose
of
or
have
jurisdiction
physically
of
the
reese
and
that's
the
situation
here.
actually,
the
--
the
whether
the
two
actions
qualify
the
nature
in
rem
or
quasi
in
rem
so
as
to
fit
into
the
reese
doctrine
it
--
it's
a
matter
of
this
real
test
and
conceded
below.
they
go
up
on
a
question
of
jurisdiction
upon
this
and
the
fact
that
we're
in
effect
suing
the
united
states
at
which
--
which
is
not
conceded
to
be
sued
in
the
state
court.
well,
of
course,
we
say
that
they‘re
not
at
this
juncture
to
examine
the
state
court's
jurisdiction.
we
say
that
if
the
examine
we're
still
on
primary
ground
for
since
1936,
the
reese
doctrine
and
all
of
the
attributes
which
are
invoked
here
by
petitioner
has
been
fully
applicable
to
the
united
states.
for
it
was
in
1936
that
your
honors
decided,
united
states
versus
bank
of
new
york
&
trust
company.
and
there,
the
respondent's
arguments
made
in
that
case
could
have
been
put
out
of
the
united
states
reports
in
the
head
notes
and
in
--
pasted
in
the
briefs
and
there'd
be
no
substantial
difference
here
that
--
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
yes,
sir.
if
the
court
please,
the
same
authorities
were
liable
to
the
united
states.
the
united
states
went
into
federal
court
subsequent
to
dependency
of
state
court
actions
involving
money
there,
a
fund.
here,
it's
mineral
rights.
they
claimed
that
the
united
states
court
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
determine
the
government's
claim
to
this
reach.
that
there
was
really
no
--
no
in
rem
case
in
the
state
court
because
the
property
wasn't
in
custodial
lease,
it
was
in
personam
at
that
junction.
it
further
claimed
that
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states
prevented
it
from
being
sued
in
the
state
court
and
that
in
effect,
they
were
really
suing
the
united
states
when
they
were
proceeding
against
property,
money
that
was,
that
the
united
states
was
claiming
as
its
own.
all
of
those
contentions
would
reject
it
unanimously
with
the
court.
the
court
there
held
and
this
needs
the
fundamental
argument
of
respondents
in
the
(inaudible)
holding
below.
that
the
united
states
court
does
not
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
a
claim
by
the
united
states
to
it
--
to
an
interest
in
property
or
to
ownership
of
property.
further,
that
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
was
no
bar
to
the
application
of
the
reese
doctrine.
they
even
said
there,
that
the
united
states
may
intervene
in
the
state
court
suits
where
these
claims
were
being
made
against
these
banks,
where
the
moneys
were
on
deposit.
as
an
actor,
asserting
its
--
the
government's
claim
to
this
money
with
no
sacrifice
of
its
--
its
dignity
as
a
sovereign
and
with
no
reduction
of
its
sovereign
immunity.
there
again
in
the
state
court
of
new
york
where
these
two
suits
were
pending
in
1933
and
1934,
the
united
states
was
not
a
party,
because
these
russian
insurance
companies
and
it's
still
surviving
the
record
who
had
brought
the
state
court
actions
claiming
ownership
of
the
record
couldn't
have
sued
the
united
states.
if
the
absence
of
the
united
states
in
a
state
court
proceeding
where
it
can't
be
sued
is
--
is
already
in
complete
answer
to
--
to
the
reese
doctrine,
then,
it
should
never
been
applied
to
the
united
states
at
all
and
yet
the
doctrine
in
counsel,
it
forced
to
admit
it
under
the
bank
of
new
york
case,
the
doctrine
is
fully
applicable
to
the
united
states.
and
if
the
--
the
objection
here
which
it
was
focused
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question,
that
since
the
united
states
is
not
in
the
state
court,
it
has
no
jurisdiction
and
therefore,
the
rule
you
rely
on
is
--
is
inapplicable.
that
whole
question
would
never
be
presented
because
if
the
united
states'
absence
was
to
be
made
a
presence,
was
to
made
a
test
of
the
reese
doctrine,
then
it
would
never
have
been
established
as
applicable
to
the
united
states
in
the
fist
place
and
for
20
years
as
i
say
the
rule
has
been
established
and
never
modified
that
the
doctrine,
the
fundamental
doctrine
which
we
invoke
is
applicable
to
the
government
of
the
united
states.
again,
we
say,
we
--
actually,
if
we
stand
where
the
richmond
brothers
case
stands,
we
do
not
need
to
discuss,
we
think,
the
merits
of
the
state
court's
jurisdiction.
but
even
if
we
are
required
to
debate
upon
the
merits
of
the
state
court's
jurisdiction
of
the
case
that's
now
there
enjoined,
we
feel
that
we
are
on
firm
ground,
both
under
state
procedure
in
the
state
jurisprudence,
and
under
the
decisions
that
we
think
are
controlling
of
this
court.
we
think
that
the
action
was
properly
brought
against
these
parties,
who
we
say
and
allege
are
wrongfully
withholding
from
us
possession
of
our
property.
and
on
up
--
our
showing
of
our
claim
of
right
to
it,
we
should
be
restored.
that
is
--
been
the
--
the
rule
of
the
louisiana
since
1836
and
we
say
consistently
since
then.
there's
some
debate
on
that
subject,
which
i
should
think
that
the
louisiana
courts,
as
to
its
jurisprudence,
would
be
the
agency
best
able
to
resolve.
under
this
--
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
yes,
procedurally
and
substantively.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
yes.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
--
i'm
not
going
to
be
so
bold
as
to
say
erie
railroads
would
have
any
bearing
would
make
the
rule
established
there
applicable
to
any
federal
court.
it
was
a
lower
echelon
decision.
it
first
based
in
other
the
words,
that
we
rounded,
but
we
don't
contend
that
it
established
a
rule
of
state
law,
that's
binding
upon
this
court.
it
does
suggest
this
though,
that
petitioner's
claim
both
procedurally
and
on
the
merits
is
one
that
has
substance.
for
the
only
court
that
has
spoken
thus
far
on
our
claim
says,
“petitioner
had
a
lot
of
minerals.
you
have
a
good
claim
and
you're
properly
in
court.
you
have
a
good
claim
on
the
merits
and
you're
properly
in
court.”
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
no,
sir,
i
wouldn't
think
so.
if
we
could
--
if
we
could
ultimately
make
out
a
claim
for
damages
say
on
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
maybe
some
kind
of
a
notion
under
the
tucker
act,
i
would
not
contend,
i
think,
that
the
lower
court's
state
decision
would
have
any
bearing
of
--
would
be
controlling
under
the
federal
court.
we
do
say
this,
that
the
--
the
louisiana
supreme
court's
decision
on
the
statute
of
louisiana
upon
which
petitioner
pitches
its
claim,
is
the
final
authoritative
decision
and
of
--
of
acceptance
so
far
as
federal
constitutional
questions
may
arise.
and
there
of
course,
or
--
or
with
that
one
exception.
louisiana
--
the
louisiana
supreme
court
has
the
final
word
as
to
what
the
act
of
1940
means,
wherefore
its
reaches,
how
deeply
it
affects
this
reservation.
does
it
affect
it
as
the
petitioner
says?
does
it
--
does
it
suspend
all
prescription
or
--
or
limitation,
whether
it
be
conventional
or
statutory,
or
does
it
affect
only
the
10-year
none-use
of
prescription
which
judge
nunez
said
it
did
and
he
avoided
by
taking
the
middle
ground
of
interpretation,
where
he
avoided
the
--
the
earlier
terminal
day
by
saying,
“that
related
only
to
the
right
of
entry”
and
that
the
10-year
prescription
as
to
the
minerals,
the
ownership
of
the
minerals
and
sales
was
alone
suspended.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
i
--
i'm
afraid
i
didn't
--
i
understood
all
of
your
language
until
the
end,
and
i
--
i
didn't
quite
get
the
impact
of
your
question.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
there
is
an
overlap.
i
think
that
we
are
claiming
--
we
are
claiming
the
ownership
of
and
the
right
to
possession
of
the
same
reese.
we
are
claiming
again
the
state
court
against
the
only
persons
that
we
may
claim
it
against
that's
people
in
possession
who
have
withheld
the
possession
from
us.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
they
--
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
yes.
they
claimed
to
do
so.
we
alleged
on
information.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
yes,
yes
--
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
yes,
sir.
they
--
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
no,
sir.
it
would
not
be
bound.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
it
couldn't
be.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
sir?
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
it
might
do
so.
it
would
certainly
be
procedurally
entitled
to
do
so,
because
it
would
not
be
res
judicata
if
the
--
if
the
state
courts
win
it
--
state
case
wins
its
cause
in
its
present
posture
without
the
united
states
intervening
as
an
actor.
then,
it
is
certainly
true
the
united
states
would
not
be
bound
by
the
final
state
of
adjudication.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
that
--
that's
my
position
and
that
really
is
the
underlying
foundation
of
--
of
the
case
three
quarters
of
a
century
ago
in
united
states
versus
lee.
because
if
the
state
court
final
adjudication
would
actually
bind
the
united
states,
then
it
would
be
difficult
to
escape
the
contention
that
you're
in
effect
suing
the
united
states
if
you
bind
them
with
or
without
its
presence
in
--
in
action
which
you
bring
yourself.
and
that
again
was
reaffirmed
in
--
in
land
versus
dollar
where
the
--
all
of
the
stock
or
the
controlling
stock
in
the
dollar
steamship
line
was
at
issue.
and
the
possession
of
which
was
sought
by
the
dollar
family
on
the
ground
that
they
owned
and
never
acquired
a
title
with
it.
and
they
said
that
the
members
of
the
maritime
commission
were
withholding
out
the
possession
wrongfully.
and
the
court
pointed
out
it
there,
just
as
it
had
pointed
out
then
some
68
years
previously
in
united
states
versus
lee
that
the
united
states
will
not
be
precluded
by
this
decree
from
bringing
its
own
action
after
the
state,
after
this
case
has
run
its
course.
and
so,
we
say
that
procedurally,
if
we're
--
if
we're
forced
into
the
area
where
we
have
to
debate
upon
the
merits,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court,
we
say
both
under
the
louisiana
law,
which
we,
of
course,
we've
tried
elaborately
enough
to
agree.
and
under
that
--
which
we
think
are
the
controlling
decisions
here,
we
may
proceed
in
the
state
court
untrammeled
by
this
injunction
and
to
get
a
final
judgment
insofar
as
it
lies
within
the
power
of
the
united
--
of
the
state
court
to
grant
it,
which
of
course,
would
fall
short
of
being
a
binding
adjudication
upon
the
united
states.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
go
ahead,
sir.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
you
--
your
honor,
i
think
that's
the
whole
case
on
the
merits.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
against
the
united
states?
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
well,
i
would
say
this
in
certain
respect,
it
accept
insofar
as
the
federal
constitutional
question
of
the
court.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
but
barring
that,
i
think
if
the
state
court
interpretation
of
the
act
of
1940
would
be
binding
upon
this
court,
i
think
even
before
erie
railroad
versus
tompkins.
that
would
have
been
the
law.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that's
my
position.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
that's
--
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
sir?
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
allegedly
by
them.
we
do
not
--
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
--
concede
as
allegedly.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
of
course,
in
--
in
the
land
versus
dollar
the
--
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
yes,
in
a
way
it
does,
your
honor,
and
i
think
in
--
in
a
vital
way
it
does,
because
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
will
determine
the
effect
of
the
reservation
that
we
--
that
our
predecessor
made
in
1938.
was
it
retroactive
transactions
prior
to
that
time?
was
it
--
did
it
deal
only
with
the
statutory
limitation?
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
the
date
--
it
was
the
date
of
our
initial
interest
in
december
1938.
that
is
the
date.
mr.
leiter
deeded
this
marsh
land
to
the
government
and
reserved
the
minerals.
we
say
we
have
never
lost
the
minerals.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
if
--
if
the
court,
if
--
if
mr.
justice
if
you
please.
that
is
when
they
got
the
deed.
but
in
the
deed,
the
minerals
were
expressly
withheld.
it
is
only
the
minerals
that
are
at
issue
here.
even
under
their
most
ambitious
theory,
they
didn't
come
into
possession
of
--
of
the
right
of
ownership
of
the
minerals
until
1945.
and
because
that
is
the
first
that
they
--
if
they
can
point
to
that
they
say,
“we
got
these
minerals.”
we
withheld
the
minerals.
it
was
a
withholding
from
the
grant
to
the
united
states.
all
they
got
was
8000
acres
of
marsh.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
with
the
--
i
think
that
an
argument
can
be
made
on
that
score.
and
that
--
that
really
just
brings
me
directly
into
my
third
point.
that
brings
into
the
question
of
what
was
the
effective
scope
of
the
1940
act
that
we
pitch
our
claim
exclusively
upon.
for
it
--
it
would
not,
for
that
act,
we
would
not
have
been
here.
we
would
not
have
been
in
the
state
court
of
louisiana
and
that
brings
directly
--
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
we
would
have
been
out
as
i
--
it's
my
appreciation
of
the
law.
so,
that
leads
me
to
the
third
and
final
point
which
our
--
we
argued
and
pleaded
from
the
inception,
and
which
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
even
mention
and
that
was
what,
as
i
said
before,
we
have
termed
that
your
honors
have
termed
that
with
a
doctrine
of
extension
and
that
is
that
that
no
doctrine
more
settled
on
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
think
mr.
justice
black
adverted
to
it
ex
parte
this
morning
in
another
connection.
no
doctrine
is
more
settled
and
that
this
court
admonishes
itself
and
the
courts
below,
not
to
reach
prematurely
for
constitutional
questions,
that
whenever
the
constitutionality
of
a
state
statute
is
drawn
into
question
on
the
ground
that
it
violates
the
federal
constitution,
and
since
more
and
more,
those
questions
have
become
interwoven
with
doubts
upon
local
law.
you
will
insist
not
merely
permit
into
discretion.
you
will
insist
that
the
court
do
not
reach
for
the
constitutional
question
in
order
to
avoid
a
premature
decision
in
respect
of
a
matter
of
local
law.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
if
the
court
please,
the
fifth
circuit
has
rendered
a
decision
on
--
involving
the
statute
in
which
judge
borah,
which,
as
i
say,
not
exactly
the
same
as
here
because
it
was
an
--
an
antecedent
reservation,
not
the
one
directed
to
the
government,
which
held
that
it
was
a
procedural
remedy
that
louisiana
had
created
a
limitation
on
minerals
that
where
in
other
places
they're
forever
to
see,
louisiana
had
--
had
given
them
a
limited
light,
it
says
it
had
the
power
to
give
them
the
limited
light
if
it
could
shorten
or
extend
or
eliminate
that
term
entirely.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
is
that
what
the
--
sir?
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
if
the
court
please,
that
would
say
nothing
more.
we
say,
counsel
differ
with
us,
than
what
the
law
said
and
added
--
took
nothing
from
what
the
law
would
have
provided.
now,
they
make
the
--
the
argument
that
there
were
additional
conditions
imposed,
but
we
say
essentially
as
judge
nunez
in
the
state
court
decreed
before
he
was
stopped
from
going
further.
essentially,
that
was
a
--
what
the
law
of
louisiana
provided
in
respect
of
a
term
that
he'd
meant,
that
since
louisiana
could
--
limits
the
term
of
the
minerals.
it
could
eliminate
the
limitation,
and
that's
what
they
did
to
benefit
the
citizens
of
the
state
in
cases
of
sales
to
the
united
states
in
the
year
1940.
so,
that
(voice
overlap),
as
i
say
in
the
--
in
the
case
of
united
states
versus
nebo
oil
company,
the
retroactivity
of
the
1940
statute
was
passed
on
in
a
different
connection,
but
it's
leased
insofar
as
the
retroactivity,
it
was
passed.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
no,
sir,
it
was
not.
they
say
that
--
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
sir?
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
no,
sir.
there
was
no.
that
it
didn't
refer
expressly
to
law
that
--
that
this
is
what
they
were
doing.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that's
--
no.
it
didn't
do
that,
your
honor.
it
actually
said
in
this
seemingly
inconsistent
date
at
the
end
of
six-and-a-half
years
--
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
--
is
what
they
say
it
should
go.
but
there,
judge
nunez
construed
that
its
meaning
only
relating
to
the
right
of
entry
and
that
the
10
years
unqualified
reservation
was
the
one
that
was
suspended
for
the
act
of
1940.
if
i
may
speed
along
in
the
minute
or
two
minutes
that
are
left,
respondents
say
that
there
would
be
no
point
in
--
in
your
honors
applying
the
doctrine
of
extension
here,
because
they
say
that
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
has
already
held
in
another
case
that
in
the
absence
of
the
united
states,
it
won't
pass
upon
this
constitutional
question.
so,
they
say,
“why
should
we
--
why
should
your
honors
do
what
the
supreme
--
send
it
back
to
the
state
court
when
supreme
court
has
declared
itself
unwilling
to
act?”
well,
it's
true
that
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana,
a
few
years
ago
in
whitney
national
bank
versus
little
creek
oil
did
refuse
to
pass
upon
the
federal
constitutionality
of
the
act
of
1940,
which
we
have
under
discussion.
but
they
did
so
for
the
sole
reason
that
the
party
who
raised
the
-
the
constitutional
question
was
little
creek
oil
company,
which
had
no
lease
from
the
united
states.
it
had
utterly
no
interest
to
raise
the
question.
it
could
not
be
prejudiced
or
held
one
way
or
the
other.
and
that
was
the
only
reason
that
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
abstained
from
deciding
the
federal
constitutional
questions.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
no,
sir.
it
would
not
be
--
that
is
not
my
contention.
it
is
my
view
your
honors
first
that
the
injunction
is
wrong.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
yes.
for
getting
a
--
a
part
from
the
injunction
--
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
--
that
the
reese
cases
that
the
inherent
nature
of
the
cases
prevents
both
suits
from
proceeding
at
once.
now,
the
relief
to
be
obtained,
it
--
it's
a
question,
whether
the
federal
action
should
be
dismissed
outright
which
was
the
action
your
honors
took
in
the
bank
of
new
york
&
trust
company
case
in
1936.
you
dismissed
or
affirmed
the
business
or
merely
a
state.
we
think
that
the
requirements
of
the
law
would
be
satisfied.
that
is
the
anti-injunction
statute
and
the
doctrine
of
the
reese
cases
and
the
doctrine
of
extension
would
be
satisfied
by
state
only
to
send
that
case
back
to
the
federal
district
court
with
instructions
to
retain
the
bill,
pending
the
outcome
of
the
state
case,
where
at
least
there
will
be
a
--
a
definitive
interpretation
of
the
act
of
1940.
that
--
that
interpretation
may
run
wholly
unnecessary
that
federal
constitutional
question
that
mr.
justice
brennan
was
worried
about,
or
that
certainly
would
emerge
and
that
is
not
a
question
of
whether
that
federal
constitutional
question
--
it
maybe
is
going
to
come
up.
it's
already
come
up
in
the
state
courts.
they
have
already
urged
the
same
--
the
federal
constitutional
inhibition
against
the
act
of
1940
in
the
state
court
before
judge
nunez
was
stopped
by
the
lower
court
injunction.
that
would
also,
i
think,
well
meet
the
irreparable
damage
of
which
is
painted
in
vivid
language
by
respondents.
and
i
think
it
had
a
lot
to
do
with
the
issuance
of
the
improvident
injunction
below
that
the
--
the
loss
of
all
the
producible
oil,
i
think
the
--
there's
really
a
--
a
masterly
presentation
of
the
irreparable
damage
to
support
an
injunction
that
had
no
legal
foundation
whatsoever.
well,
that's
the
--
the
alternative
suggestion
as
to
the
relief,
would
i
think
be
a
sufficient
answer
because
if
the
case
were
reversed
and
the
--
the
instructions
to
the
lower
court
would
retain
the
bill,
they
could
renew
the
application
for
the
restraining
order
in
any
appropriate
time
that
they
felt
the
lessees
were
being
--
going
to
be
ousted
from
this
oil
field.
again,
and
finally,
the
respondents
paint
the
--
the
deplorable
consequences
of
a
reversal,
the
--
the
lack
of
uniformity
to
what
exists
of
--
of
both
procedurally
and
substantively
if
the
state
courts
were
permitted
in
48
different
jurisdictions
to
decide
these
questions
of
land
law
upon
which
might
depend
the
rights
of
the
united
states.
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
a
deplorable
consequence
at
all
because
--
particularly
in
this
case
where
the
law
of
louisiana
is
unique.
why
should
--
why
should
a
local
land
law
of
louisiana
be
decided
in
--
in
conformity
with
the
laws
of
oregon,
or
--
or
--
and
of
course
with
the
concepts
that
any
common
law
judge
throughout
the
rest
of
the
country
might
entertain?
and
i
don't
think
the
constitution
contemplates
it.
in
fact,
i
think
that
the
constitution
denounces
it
because
in
matters
of
local
land
law,
the
--
the
laws
of
the
separate
states
have
always
been
considered
entirely
supreme.
and
finally,
with
respect
to
these
deplorable
consequences,
i
should
like
to
refer
to
mr.
justice
miller's
language
in
the
lee
case
which
in
a
similar
manner,
75
years
ago,
the
same
deplorable
consequences
were
predicted.
and
he
said
that
the
hypothetical
evils
may
always
be
suggested
by
a
fruitful
imagination
when,
in
regard
to
laws
upon
which
that
defend
the
rights
of
the
individual
or
the
government.
but
if
the
existence
of
such
laws
is
to
be
made
upon
their
capacity
to
withstand
such
criticism,
then
the
whole
fabric
of
the
law
must
fail.
petitioner
submits
this
case.
mr.
samuel
w.
plauche,
jr.
we
have
submitted
the
case,
your
honor.
to
go
ahead
with
the
petitioner.
