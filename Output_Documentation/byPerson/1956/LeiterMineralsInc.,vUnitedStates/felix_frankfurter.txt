justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
why
no
one
view
at
all
on
the
merits
of
your
legal
position
but
i'd
like
us
to
--
with
the
issue
of
their
practicality.
what,
are
you
free
to
state
or
would
you
be
good
enough
to
state
what
difference
it
makes
for
you
whether
it
--
the
state
case
goes
on
or
the
federal
or
the
thing
is
litigated
in
the
federal
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
statutes
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
like
to
see
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
of
their
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course
your
federal
judges
are
also
(inaudible)
to
the
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
want
to
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
is
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
the
united
mine
workers
case,
is
a
--
is
a
little
qualification
on
--
on
that
contention,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was
hoping
i'd
get
one
from
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
seems
that
the
court
is
a
pathetic
listener
than
i
am.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
reason
i
think
the
question
is
because
that
too
pointing
the
question
of
that
too
was
in
legislation
considered
as
a
party
that
was
the
limitation
upon
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
going
to
say
something
about
the
--
the
underlying
consideration
of
the
anti-injunction
statute,
namely,
you
said
this
is
a
threshold
person?
justice
felix
frankfurter
someone
is
going
to
take
the
opposite
position
and
says
that
you
can
get
--
this
is
something
you
desire
the
position
of
the
united
states.
it
--
is
it
a
threshold
person,
because
the
anti-injunction
statute
directs
itself
in
conflict
between
two,
the
court
that
to
sovereignty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
here,
if
uncle
sam
is
the
determining
the
fact
that
you
can't
have
litigation
without
him,
this
conflict
is
brought
into
play.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
that's
why
they
say
you
can't
sue
anybody.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
makes
them
short.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
say
that
the
rights
that
would
be
established
at
the
state
suit
or
allowed
to
complete
its
course
and
establish
in
your
favor
involved
no
overlapping
claims
by
the
united
--
asserted
by
the
united
states
in
(inaudible)
in
a
federal
court
to
acquire
title.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
--
does
that
--
does
all
that
would
be
involved
in
a
judgment
in
your
favor
if
the
state
proceeding
were
allowed
to
run
its
course
does
not
--
does
not
overlap
any
interest
asserted
by
the
united
states
in
(inaudible)
to
acquire
title.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
--
and
they
derived
and
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
be
derived
from
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
i
understand
--
i
understand
that
as
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
proactive
claim,
the
denial
of
claim
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
there
is
this
overlapping
claim
to
see
what
would
be
adjudicated
in
the
state
court
and
what
the
united
states
asserted.
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
--
then
suppose
you
get,
suppose
your
case
goes
to
judgment
--
is
--
does
--
does
that
affect
the
suit
by
the
united
states?
would
it
be
bound
by
that
(voice
overlap)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
it
would
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
something.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
it
would
--
it
could
and
would
if
they're
doing
it.
we
litigated
something
and
we
get
a
conclusion
maybe
it's
by
your
court
all
you
need
to
do
is
to
do
--
do
the
answer,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
know
that
will
affect
you're
saying.
the
united
states
need
not
be
a
part
of
this.
it's
not
a
necessary
part
of
the
state's
position,
and
that
suit
may
proceed
without
any
adverse
effect
upon
the
united
states
because
the
united
states
is
unaffected
juridically
speaking
by
whatever
the
state
court
may
decide.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
involve
united
states
properly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
if
you
involve
the
proprietary
from
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
unless
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
allegedly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
construction
of
the
statute,
does
that
--
does
that
determine
whether
their
allegation
of
interest
is
correct
or
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
initial
date
of
the
--
against
the
united
states?
justice
felix
frankfurter
1940,
a
year-and-a-half
later.
of
course,
we
say
that
if
the
fifth
circuit
held
in
a
case,
not
exactly
on
all
force,
it
--
it
was
a
statute
dealing
with
the
remedy
and
it
under
well
established
doctrine
of
construction
of
--
of
statutes
that
it
may
be
retroactive
without
impairing
the
obligation
of
a
contract.
of
course,
our
--
our
counsel,
of
our
friends
here
say
that
it
--
you
construed
as
we
say
or
as
we
have
said
previously,
it
should
be
construed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
under
the
problem,
mr.
plauche.
if
it
--
it
it's
of
united
states
--
arose
in
1938
(inaudible)
why
--
wasn't
the
interest
of
united
states
fixed
as
of
that
date
regardless
of
what
your
legislature
did
in
1940.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
isn't
the
--
isn't
scope
the
legal
consequences
of
controlling
in
1938,
fixed
as
1938
so
far
as
any
claim
of
the
united
states
is
concerned,
what
that
withholding
a
residence
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
going
to
interrupt
your
argument,
but
from
what
you
have
said
about
the
power
of
the
united
states,
the
state
from
going
into
the
state
suit
and
its
freedom
from
being
compelled,
the
conclusion
is
drawn
that
if
the
state
court
is
allowed
to
proceed,
the
united
states
isn't
going
to
be
disadvantaged
on
its
merits.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
long
did
the
state
court
proceedings
in
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
--
before
you
moved
into
federal
court
from
--
to
--
to
enjoinment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
seven
months.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
an
argument
of
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
strange
that
that
state
should
have
known
about
it,
after
all
this
is
a
public
matter,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
anyhow,
you
don't
take
that
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
to
say
the
appendage
on
all
of
the
united
states
is
disqualified,
would
be
disqualified
to
intervene
in
the
state
suit
on
the
theory
that
in
thereby
protecting
on
the
assumption
that
in
doing,
so
he
would
be
protecting
but
might
(inaudible)
upon
title
of
the
united
states?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
understand
that
this
attorney
general
to
the
united
states
can't
exercise
his
judgment
of
protecting
the
right
of
the
united
states,
either
by
intervening
in
a
suit
in
the
state
court
or
starting
as
an
independent
(inaudible)
he
started
here.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
this
would
be
defensive
if
--
if
the
united
--
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
said
this
is
a
proceeding
which
bring
them
to
question
on
why
does
the
united
states,
i
should
think
that's
--
you're
defending
an
interest
of
the
united
states.
(inaudible)
you
know
and
i
don't.
this
actually
is
on
that
it
is
the
power
of
the
attorney
general
to
circumscribe
with
that.
he
can't
consent
to
give
away
property.
he
can't
weigh
the
immunity
of
the
united
states,
now
that's
--
it's
only
the
congress
who
can
but
i
should
think
he
had
a
little
more
leeway,
as
a
matter
of
professional
strategy
where,
when
and
how
to
protect
that
interest
of
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
understand
that
that
is
an
issue,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
the
concept
of
the
difficulty,
the
barrier
is
that
it
is
this
controversy
wouldn't
arise
if
we
didn't
have
2283.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
wouldn't
be
the
first
time
for
the
litigation
--
that
a
litigation
here
endowed
would
be
without
a
substance.
i
don't
think
you
make
out
of
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
up
in
joining
that
state
litigation
because
you
can
affirmatively
suggest
that
--
that
ultimately
the
case
should
have
to
be
decided
against
the
plaintiff
in
the
louisiana
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
would
the
case
(inaudible)
those
are
cases
where
litigation
was
started
in
the
federal
court
and
as
a
matter
of
why
judicial
administration,
this
court,
then
we'd
like
to
know
what
the
state
law
means
as
interpreted
by
the
state
court
because
until
we
know
that,
we
can't
pass
on
to
federal.
what
i'm
suggesting
without
touching
the
merits
of
this
controversy
as
i
see
it
in
here,
the
fact
that
in
your
view
and
for
all
i
know
in
my
view
as
i
was
confident
to
have
a
view,
there's
no
merit
--
there's
no
merit
to
the
louisiana
case,
doesn't
further
the
problem
of
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
didn't
have
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
isn't
enough
where
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
if
this
were
a
suit,
if
this
were
federal
--
if
this
were
a
litigation
as
it
was
in
the
state
court
of
louisiana
the
you'd
find
(inaudible)
and
instead
of
the
united
states
or
the
united
states
had
a
general
statute
of
amenability
to
sue.
so,
he
didn't
have
that
power
in
other
words
if
these
were
highlights
within
the
federal
court,
the
fact
that
the
louisiana
litigation
status
wouldn't
be
a
reason
for
enjoining
the
louisiana
litigation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
you
were
--
the
whole
case
turns
on
this
question
of
2283.
you're
tied
to
that
because
this
plaintiff
doesn't
want
anything
from
the
united
states
by
louisiana
suit.
both
of
you
agree
that
that
judgment
--
the
judgment
in
that
court
in
the
action
brought,
the
petitory
action
brought
cannot
possibly
adversely
affect
the
united
states.
so
that
he
say,
you
could
leave
me
alone,
you
are
not
disadvantaged
as
i've
heard
the
argument
about
the
irreparable
damage
and
practical
consideration.
he
says
as
a
matter
of
law,
this
is
a
common
place
in
our
federal
system
that
from
the
start
to
assume
the
state
court
and
--
but
he
hasn't
been
involved
but
starts
the
suit
to
federal
court,
indeed
in
the
first
election
suits
may
be
started
in
both
courts
at
the
same
time.
and
in
your
own
proceed
and
finally
you
don't
get
the
judgment
in
both
courts,
in
litigating
to
both
courts.
except
insofar
as
2283,
there's
no,
that's
going
to
alleviate
this
conflicting
situation
by
an
injunction.
this
is
all
this
litigation
turned
down,
whether
the
government
position
in
the
court
to
do
as
in
below
is
correct
with
the
2283.
and
you
addressed
yourself
and
the
assistant
attorney
general
have
to
that
problem.
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
crux
of
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
it
applies
is
the
crux
of
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
have
to
think
about
it.
i
--
i
don't
need
to
pass
on
the
merits.
something
--
that
is
the
problem
and
all
these
other
things
seem
to
be
beside
the
point.
so
long
as
you
were
the
--
to
cause
the
government
--
to
cause
this
action
by
private
litigant,
there's
another
private
litigant
would
then
foreclose
the
interest
of
the
united
states,
whether
title
or
less
than
a
title,
no
(inaudible)
about
that,
is
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
says
i'm
not
--
i
don't
want
anything
against
united
states,
it
belongs
to
it.
and
you
say
that
he
is
litigating
something
that
inevitably
affects
the
united
states,
not
because
the
louisiana
court
in
a
later
judgment
against
the
united
states
but
for
practical
consideration
in
the
nature
for
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
the
schwalby
case
but
the
--
being
the
first
stage
of
the
schwalby
case
recognized
that
the
district
attorney,
the
u.s.
attorney
of
louisiana
can
walk
into
the
--
into
this
action
and
make
a
suggestion
to
the
court,
the
united
states
have
an
interest
which
ought
to
lead
to
the
dismissal
of
that
suit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
not
--
i'd
like
to
suggest
it
would
be
binding.
the
question
is
whether
that
suit
should
be
enjoined.
