mr.
charles
d.
marshall
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
defendants
in
the
state
court
litigation.
there
have
been
sued
by
express
allegation
in
their
capacity
of
mineral
lessees
of
the
united
states.
i
submit
that
the
nature
of
the
property
rights
at
stake
in
the
state
court
litigation
has
great
practical
significance
here
for
these
are
producing
oil
and
gas
wells,
in
which
there
were
more
than
80
in
number
when
the
case
was
tried
two-and-half
years
ago.
producing
oil
and
gas
wells
are
wasting
assets
and
possession
of
such
assets
carries
with
it
the
power
to
consume
and
destroy
them.
every
barrel
of
oil,
which
this
petitioner
might
be
able
to
appropriate
on
to
itself
if
they
got
possession
in
the
state
court.
and
every
barrel
of
oil
which
would
be
lost
due
to
the
damage,
which
will
occur
as
i
will
show
in
a
moment,
in
the
event
of
any
such
a
transfer
in
the
state
court
as
a
barrel
of
oil,
which
is
a
reduction
of
the
property
rights
themselves.
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
the
state
suit
is
pending.
the
exceptions
that
we
filed
were
overruled
by
the
state
court
at
which
point
when
our
time
to
answer
expired
--
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
the
united
states
got
--
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
sir?
and
like
a
demurrer.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
so,
when
the
acceptance
were
overruled
and
our
time
to
answer
expired
in
the
state
court,
the
united
states
attorney
went
into
the
federal
court
at
new
orleans
and
got
this
temporary
injunction
to
stop
petitioner
from
taking
default
judgment
against
this
or
otherwise
proceeding
in
the
state
court.
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
i
have
not
answered
it.
no,
sir.
and
every
barrel
of
oil
which
would
be
lost
in
the
event
we
were
dispossessed
in
the
state
court
is
a
barrel
of
oil,
in
which
the
united
states
will
never
receive
any
royalty.
and
we
would
look
to
the
united
states
as
its
mineral
lessees
to
maintain
as
in
feasible
possession
of
this
property,
it
has
an
obligation
to
do
so
and
we
would
expect
it
to
hold
as
harmless
to
--
and
harmless
as
to
any
damages
which
we
might
sustain.
i
submit
therefore,
that
the
effect
of
this
state
court
suit
inasmuch
as
it
reduces
the
property
rights
themselves,
this
loss
of
oil
and
the
appropriation
of
oil
by
this
petitioner,
which
it
--
would
occur
there
is
therefore
a
suit
directly
against
the
property
rights
and
interest
of
the
government.
but
the
state
court
suit
is
also,
even
in
form,
a
suit
against
the
united
states
under
our
law.
all
that
a
petitory
action
is
in
louisiana
law
is
a
simple
suit
to
adjudicate
title
brought
by
the
party
out
of
possession,
the
claimant
out
of
possession
against
the
defendant,
who
is
in
possession.
how
long
continued
possession
such
as
the
united
states
had
is
the
court
in
recognition
under
our
law.
we
do
not
permit
such
long
and
continued
possession.
it
would
be
disturbed
by
an
adverse
claimant
who
seeks
possessory
relief
along.
he
has
to
come
in
with
this
petitory
action
and
have
it
adjudicated.
in
this
case,
that
this
petitioner's
title
is
good
and
that
the
united
states
title
is
bad
or
he
can't
achieve
any
possessory
relief
whatsoever
against
us.
but
the
dispute
as
to
title
lies
not
between
the
petitioner
and
the
mineral
lessees
of
the
united
states
by
the
very
declaration
in
that
suit,
that
we
are
sued
as
mineral
lessees.
this
petitioner
admits
that
the
dispute
as
to
title
is
between
petitioner
and
the
united
states.
and
that
shows
that
even
in
form
this
suit
is
a
suit
against
the
government
and
it
brings
it
directly
under
the
rule
of
the
decisions
in
the
schwalby
case,
new
mexico
versus
lane,
louisiana
versus
garfield
and
kindred
cases
culminating
in
the
larson
case.
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
our
exceptions
or
demurrer
raised
the
question
phrase
that
this
was
actually
a
suit
against
the
united
states,
that
it
was
an
indispensable
party,
that
it
could
not
be
made
a
party
to
that
suit.
and
finally,
we
raised
the
question
of
the
statement
of
the
claim
made
by
the
complaint
in
the
state
court,
the
validity
of
the
claim
which
was
asserted
there.
and
the
state
court
overruled
all
of
those
exceptions
in
an
opinion
holding
that
in
effect
that
petitioner's
claim
was
good
and
the
united
states
claim
was
bad,
that
the
united
states
was
not
an
indispensable
party
and
that
the
claim
stated
the
cause
of
action.
now,
the
considerations
that
i've
mentioned
about
the
damages
which
would
occur
to
the
property
of
the
united
states
are
these.
this
oil
field
is
being
operated
on
a
gas
injection
method.
that
is
a
procedure
whereby
gas
is
reintroduced
into
subsurface
structure
at
control
pressures
in
its
selected
points
in
this
oil
field
in
the
interest
of
long-range
maximum
production.
that
is
a
complicated
endeavor
of
necessity.
it
is
based
upon
studies,
analyses,
and
techniques
developed
by
the
united
states
mineral
lessees
throughout
their
long
association
with
this
property
and
in
the
course
of
drilling
there,
more
than
80
wells.
the
uncontradicted
proof
in
this
record
is
that
whether
that
there'd
be
any
transfer
of
control
away
from
the
mineral
lessees
of
the
united
states,
not
even
the
most
competent
and
skillful
outside
operator
could
be
substituted
for
them
without
permanent
and
irretrievable
loss,
nor
could
there
be
any
interruption
in
the
production
for
a
moment
without
serious
loss
of
recoverable
oil.
the
proof
in
this
record
is
that
where
the
flow
of
oil
to
be
interrupted
from
these
wells
as
to
many
of
them,
it
would
never
be
established
again
and
much
oil
that
would
be
recoverable,
would
be
lost
forever.
in
the
event
of
any
interruption,
drainage
would
occur
from
one
of
the
united
states
lands
in
favor
of
adjoining
lands.
moreover,
oil
and
gas
production
is
a
hazardous
business.
wells
may
blow
out,
go
out
of
control
or
other
things
happen
unless
the
most
careful
and
prudent
practices
are
observed
in
day-to-day
operations.
if
anyone
of
those
things
were
to
happen,
untold
damage
could
occur
and
whole
segments
of
this
reservoir
be
rendered
worthless
for
all
time
to
come.
petitioner's
suit
in
the
state
court
proposes
to
visit
these
things
upon
us,
to
no
purpose
because
it
concedes
in
the
brief
in
this
court's
--
in
this
court
that
the
state
court
suit
could
not
be
a
res
judicata
of
the
interest
to
the
united
states.
so,
we
are
confronted
with
a
temporary
eviction
in
the
state
court
in
a
case
that
can
solve
nothing.
and
this
petitioner,
as
the
record
shows,
is
a
corporation
which
was
organized
just
prior
to
bringing
this
suit
in
the
state
court.
the
record
further
shows
that
its
claim
to
his
department
or
raise
was
conveyed
to
it
to
stop.
and
well
may
we
know
that
this
petitioner
is
wholly
unable
to
respond
in
damages
of
the
sort
it
suit
rightness
to
impose
upon
us.
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
we
must
--
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
the
--
the
answer
lies,
i
think,
in
the
circumstances
in
which
this
case
is
found
in
the
lower
court
at
this
time.
where
our
exceptions
have
been
overruled,
our
time
for
answering
has
expired.
the
state
court
has
rendered
a
ruling,
which
in
effect
decides
all
of
the
issues
in
the
merits
of
this
case.
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
well,
i
submit
that
there
would
be
no
purpose
in
permitting
that
suit
to
go
forward
in
the
state
courts
under
any
phase
of
the
situation,
because
the
state
courts
cannot
render
a
binding
decision
against
the
interest
of
the
united
states.
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
well,
let
--
let
me
answer
that
this
way.
the
rights
of
the
united
states
and
ourselves
in
this
case
are
far
too
valuable
in
the
state
court
ever
to
be
jeopardized
by
any
possibility
of
an
eviction
in
the
future,
or
the
fact
that
this
petitioner
might
or
might
not
choose
to
execute
the
judgment
at
anytime.
the
availability
of
a
remedy
by
suspensive
appeal
in
this
case,
in
the
state
courts
would
be
a
very
uncertain
quantity.
the
bond
to
be
required
would
be
simply
enormous,
it
would
be
one-and-half
times
the
gross
production
of
the
date
of
that
field,
plus
one-and-half
times
the
estimated
future
production
there
in
the
cost
of
the
field,
plus
such
amount
that
the
state
court
judge
might
in
his
discretion
file
on
top
of
all
of
that.
i
don't
know
whether
we
could
post
such
a
bond
and
yet
the
posting
of
that
bond
would
be
jurisdictional
to
the
taking
of
a
suspensive
appeal
in
the
state
court.
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
because
the
--
we
say
that
at
the
moment,
the
situation
is
eminent.
the
state
court,
having
overruled
our
exceptions
and
if
we
filed
an
answer
raising
essentially
the
same
contentions
as
we
did
in
the
exceptions,
we
might
be
faced
with
an
immediate
judgment
on
the
pleadings
in
this
case
with
a
threat
of
execution
at
once.
there
might
not
be
sufficient
--
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
--
time.
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
there
might
not
be
a
sufficient
time
to
go
back
if
he
gets
his
writ
of
possession
in
louisiana
it
would
be
enforceable
immediately.
there
might
--
there
simply
might
not
be
sufficient
time
--
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
no,
sir.
there
would
be
a
three
days
notice
on
that
thing.
but
if
we
were
given
that
three
days
notice
--
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
sir?
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
to
the
defendant.
that
he's
going
to
be
evicted
under
louisiana
law.
but
let
me
say
this.
we
would
be
much
better
off
in
this
case
by
maintaining
the
injunction
at
the
present
stage
than
waiting
until
state
court
might
issue
a
final
order
of
eviction.
because
the
distasteful
clash
between
the
federal
and
state
courts
would
inevitably
become
worst
in
the
event
the
state
court
proceeding
goes
to
final
judgment
and
then
we
then
have
to
enjoin
and
undo
it,
what
it
says
to
do.
it
will
be
much
better
at
this
level
of
proceedings
to
stop
this
petitioner
from
going
forward
with
its
case,
where
the
injunction
operates
on
the
petitioner
alone
and
where
there
is
no
interference
with
the
judgment
of
a
state
court
at
this
level.
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
there
are
--
the
proof
in
the
record
shows
there
are
wells
in
the
main
pass
of
the
mississippi
river
adjoining
this
property,
which
in
the
event
of
any
cessation
of
production
would
effect
drainage
from
beneath
these
lands.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
now,
as
i
have
said,
this
suit
in
the
state
court
is
a
petitory
action
to
adjudicate
the
title
of
the
united
states.
for
that
reason,
since
the
title
dispute
is
between
the
less
--
not
between
the
adverse
claimant
and
the
lessee
but
between
the
adverse
claimant
and
the
lessor,
all
of
the
louisiana
decisions
for
the
last
100
years
have
held
without
exceptions
that
the
lessor,
which
in
this
case
is
the
united
states,
is
either
the
actual
defendant
or
an
indispensable
party
defendant
in
the
state
court
action.
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
the
united
states
would
be
at
liberty
to
go
into
the
state
courts
and
file
a
title
suit.
yes,
sir.
it
has
not
chosen
to
have
done
so
--
to
do
so
in
this
instance.
but
to
tell
the
united
states
here,
if
this
court
would
have
to
tell
the
united
states
that
you've
got
to
go
into
plaquemine
parish,
louisiana
and
you've
have
got
to
file
a
suit
there
or
if
this
court
would
have
to
tell
the
united
states,
you
got
to
go
down
there
and
intervene
in
plaquemine
parish
would
be
telling
the
united
states
that
you've
got
to
go
into
plaquemine
parish
court
as
a
defendant.
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
because
the
united
states
is
an
indispensable
party
defendant
there
under
the
state
law
now.
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
because
the
--
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
because
the
united
states
--
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
my
point
is
that
if
we
told
the
united
states
that
you
have
to
go
into
plaquemine
parish
on
any
basis
whatsoever,
you
can't
sue
in
your
own
courts,
would
be
permitting
the
adverse
claimant
to
select
the
court,
where
united
states
had
to
appear.
and
that
in
effect
would
be
permitting
him
to
sue
the
united
states
as
a
defendant
in
the
state
court
of
his
own
selection
and
it
would
mean
that
the
united
states
could
be
--
could
be
sued
in
a
title
action
in
a
state
court
anywhere
throughout
this
county
at
the
whim
of
an
adverse
claimant.
all
you
have
--
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
yes
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
in
the
first
place,
and
this
is
the
complete
answer.
this
state
statute
act
315
of
1940
has
no
business
in
this
case
whatsoever.p
etitioner's
contention,
that
this
statute
needs
an
interpretation,
in
this
case,
is
wholly
without
substance.
all
we
are
here
concerned
with
is
an
express
contract
of
the
united
states.
now,
at
the
time
the
united
states
and
leiter
entered
into
that
contract
in
1935
and
at
the
time
the
deed
to
the
united
states
was
executed
in
1938,
and
today,
the
parties
under
louisiana
law
are
at
perfect
liberty
to
contract
for
all
these
things
like
the
united
states
and
leiter
did.
and
that
contract
says
in
plain
words,
that
his
rights
were
going
to
expire
on
april
1st,
1945,
unless
he
produced
oil
with
commercial
advantage
before
that
date.
and
even
if
he
did
that
the
contract
says
he
could
only
keep
his
rights
as
to
25
acres
around
each
producing
well,
and
he
didn't
conduct
a
day
of
operations
in
compliance
for
those
requirement.
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
i
say
that
--
all
i'm
showing
that
on
the
merits
this
state
statute
has
been
dragged
in
by
the
heels
and
has
no
business
in
this
case.
i
don't
think
petitioner
can
succeed
here
with
the
mere
assertion
that
he
wants
an
interpretation
of
a
state
statute,
unless
this
court
finds
that
the
interpretation
of
that
state
statute
is
necessary
and
if
there's
some
substance
to
the
contention
and
i
say
there
is
no
substance
to
it.
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
no,
sir.
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
no,
sir.
i
--
i
do
not
take
the
--
so
understand
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
as
i
read
the
cases,
where
there's
discretionary
rule
has
been
invoked.
i
refer
now
to
the
communist
control
or
law
of
michigan,
the
right
to
work
law
of
florida,
and
the
pullman
porter's
case
from
texas
relied
on
by
petitioner.
in
everyone
of
those
cases
before
this
court
said,
you
need
an
interpretation
of
the
state
statute
in
the
state
court
--
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
it
shows
that
this
state
statute,
your
honor,
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
situation
--
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
--
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
why
should
--
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
no,
sir.
i
am
not
talking
about
that.
what
i
am
answering
is
the
question
whether
we
need
an
interpretation
of
a
state
statute.
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
i
say
the
state
statute
has
nothing
to
do
with
a
decision
of
this
case
and
we
have
briefed
that
point
rather
thoroughly
and
the
point
is
completely
covered
in
the
briefs
i
have
with
the
time
to
stop
now.
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
yes,
sir.
we
have
briefed
section
2283.
and
that
i
would
only
say
this.
that
any
suggestion
that
congress
in
enacting
section
2283
could
have
had
any
intention
to
cripple
the
united
states
in
the
protection
of
its
properties
would
certainly
require
the
clearest
and
strongest
evidence
to
require
that
result.
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
no
jurisdiction
to
entertain
a
suit
against
the
united
states.
no,
sir.
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
well,
this
petition
that
to
sue
the
united
states,
it
may
well
have
had
a
remedy
in
this
case
in
the
court
of
claims,
if
indeed
it
does
have
any
rights
left
under
its
contract
with
the
united
states
and
the
united
states
is
breaching
that
contract.
and,
of
course,
whether
it
has
a
remedy
in
the
court
of
claims
or
not,
it
does
have
a
remedy
here
now
in
this
suit
in
the
united
states
courts
for
the
ascertainment
of
its
rights.
now,
since
this
is
the
only
court
in
which
a
final
and
binding
adjudication
on
the
title
of
the
united
states
can
be
made,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
courts
is
exclusive
to
that
extent
and
it
would
not
be
an
effective
jurisdiction
and
unless
pending
their
determination,
you
are
able
to
stop
the
state
court
case
from
going
ahead
and
causing
possible
havoc
to
the
property.
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
that
section
2283
does
not
apply
to
the
government.
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
yes,
sir.
well,
wouldn't
it
also
be
an
aid
of
the
federal
court's
jurisdiction?
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
no,
sir.
but
we
say
that
--
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
and
because
the
form
of
the
suit
is
one
against
the
united
states
with
then
this
schwalby
case,
and
new
mexico
versus
lane,
and
all
of
the
other
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
but
it
held
that
it
would
not
be
binding
and
it
meant
that
the
state
court
did.
mr.
charles
d.
marshall
now,
i
submit
that
it
should
be
enjoined
in
order
to
prevent
the
irreparable
injuries,
which
we
have
shown
would
occur.
thank
you.
