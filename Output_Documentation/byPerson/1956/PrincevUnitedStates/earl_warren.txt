suppose

into

times
with
the
idea
of
robbing
it
when

when
the
time
was
propitious
and
he
have
cashed
a
check
and
he
say,
“well,
this
isn't
the
time.”
so
he'd
walk
out
and
he
waited
a
little
a
while
and
come
back
and
suppose
he
did
that
about
three
times
during
the
day
and
then
--
and
then
finally
he
robbed
it
about
the
fourth
time.
