now,
15
years
that
he
had
on
the
second
count,
does
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
consecutive
to
the
20
years?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
is
the
maximum
on
that
second
count?
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
jenkins,
may
i
ask,
actually
i
--
i
gather
is
the
second
paragraph
of
subdivision
(a)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
they
signed
it
here,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
well
as
(d).
now,
that
creates
an
act
offense
dichotomy,
i
gather.
the
same
act
as
this
appears,
may
be
two
offenses.
is
that
what
you
would
think
the
government
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
in
effect,
the
same
act
is
made
two
offenses,
is
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
you
say
no
because
you
say
that
(d)
embraces
(a).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
if
there's
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
that
should
--
we
should
conclude
that
was
not
the
case
and
that
(a)
and
(d)
are
separate
offenses.
are
you
raising
your
constitutional
question
based
in
the
fact
that
the
same
act
is
made
two
offenses?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
into
(d).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
still
trying
to
find
out
whether
in
the
event
we
don't
quite
agree
and
should
feel
that
(d)
has
a
different
offense
from
(a),
although
both
go
out
of
the
same
act.
are
you
--
which
are
making
any
constitutional
point
of
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
he
said
no
but
it
smacks
the
double
jeopardy.
that
tells
me,
no,
it
isn't
constitutional
question,
yes,
it
is.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
ms.
rosenberg,
may
i
ask,
did
the
first
paragraph
of
paragraph
(a)
come
in
at
the
same
time
as
the
second
paragraph?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
where
did
this
paragraph
(a)
come
from?
i
mean
the
--
if
the
paragraph
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
tell
me
this.
suppose
you
had
an
employee
of
a
bank
who
came
to
work
in
the
morning
with
nothing
on
his
mind
at
all,
in
the
course
of
the
day,
he
decided
he's
going
to
rob
the
bank
and
he
takes
a
gun
and
he
does
just
what
this
defendant
did
here.
now,
as
i
read
this
first
paragraph
of
paragraph
(a),
now
that
would
be,
would
it
not,
a
taking
with
intimidation
of
money
of
the
bank.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
reading
now
from
the
first
paragraph
of
paragraph
(a).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
saying
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
he
did
it
what
this
--
this
defendant
did
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he'd
be
guilty
of
offense
under
paragraph
(a).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he'd
also
be
guilty
since
he
used
the
gun
on
paragraph
(d).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right.
the
same
thing
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
you
think
are
on
both
instances.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
that
instance,
that's
my
question.
would
that
be
one
offense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
only
one
offense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
you
see
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
you
see
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at,
if
--
if
that's
right,
then
under
the
first
paragraph
of
now
paragraph
(a)
of
2113,
in
the
situation
i
put
to
you,
that
would
be
an
offense
while
an
offense
under
that
paragraph
and
also
under
(d)
would
be
only
one
offense.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
is
it
that
we
have
two
offenses
where
it's
an
entry
and
causing
the
question,
the
second
paragraph
of
paragraph
(a)
of
2113?
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
certainly
agree
with
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
your
arguments,
no
needn't
repeat
it.
i
just
wanted
to
see.
then
your
answer
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
your
answer
to
me
is
that
that
first
paragraph
of
paragraph
(a)
came
in,
in
1934
and
the
second
paragraph
for
very
different
purpose
in
1947.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
1937.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
ms.
rosenberg,
that
means
i
gather
that
in
the
case
i
put
to
you,
the
--
the
employee
come
to
work
in
the
morning
intending
to
do
what
he
finally
did
in
the
--
in
the
end
of
the
day.
he
could
have
the
same
sentence
as
this
fellow
has.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
two
sentences.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
assuming
he
enters,
he
attempted
to
enter
when
he
came
to
work
in
the
morning
and
his
intention
when
he
entered
that
morning
was
that
he
was
going
to
rob
the
bank
during
the
day
with
a
gun
and
he
did.
and
that
circumstance,
he
could
have,
as
this
defendant
did,
get
the
enhanced
punishment,
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
he
came
and
made
up
his
mind
during
the
day
to
rob
the
bank,
couldn't
he?
