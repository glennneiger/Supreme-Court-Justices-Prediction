mr.
joseph
p.
jenkins
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
criminal
case
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
which
had
overruled
an
order
entered
by
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
texas,
whether
affirmed
in
which
he
had
overruled
an
order
for
a
motion
filed
by
the
defendant
asking
the
court
to
placate
or
correct
an
illegal
sentence.
it
involves
interpretation
of
that
part
of
a
bank
robbery
act
which
i
believe
because
of
the
contentions
of
the
government
and
because
of
the
fifth
circuit
courts
of
appeal
relative
to
the
entry
with
intent
provision
has
placed
that
particular
provision
in
a
rather
unique
position
insofar
as
the
(inaudible)
of
our
jurisprudence
is
concerned
with
criminal
matters
because
this
court
is
being
asked
to
construe
the
bank
robbery
statute.
first,
to
define
the
purpose
of
the
1937
amendment
to
the
statute,
secondly,
to
determine
what
is
a
maximum
sentence
imposable
under
subsections
(a),
(b)
and
(d)
of
the
statute
which
are
the
traditional
or
classic
form
of
bank
robbery,
if
i
may
the
use
the
term.
and
thirdly,
if
a
person
is
accused
of
entering
a
bank
with
intent
to
commit
a
robbery
or
felony
therein
or
larceny
and
counsel
makes
the
act
particularly
under
aggravated
circumstances
as
involved
in
this
case,
whether
or
not
the
entry
with
intent
act,
which
is
peaceful
in
this
case,
merges
with
the
aggravated
robbery
provision.
the
sole
contention
of
the
petitioner
here
is
that
count
two
of
the
indictment
here
it
involved
is
legal
and
that
no
crime
was
committed
thereon.
and
if
a
crime
was
committed,
it
was
merged
in
the
first
count
of
the
indictment.
the
statute
involved
is
title
18,
section
2113,
the
federal
bank
robbery
act.
this
act
was
enacted
in
1948
as
a
reenactment
of
the
original
bank
robbery
statute,
title
12,
section
588
(b)
amended
in
1937
and
repealed
at
the
time
the
reenactment
was
held.
subsection
(a)
of
the
act
prohibits
two
crimes,
robbery
by
force
and
violence
and
intimidation
and
entry
of
a
bank
with
intent
to
commit
a
felony
therein
affecting
such
bank
and
larceny
and
a
20-year
penalty
is
assessable.
subsection
(b)
prohibits
grand
and
petit
larceny.
subsection
(d)
which
is
a
rather
unique
statute
prohibits
any
of
these
acts
to
be
committed
by
the
use
of
a
dangerous
weapon
or
device
by
assault.
and
if
so,
a
penalty
of
25
years
is
assessable.
this
is
known
as
the
jeopardy
or
aggravated
portion
of
the
statute.
now,
the
facts
--
mr.
joseph
p.
jenkins
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
p.
jenkins
that's
correct.
the
facts
are
simple,
your
honor.
and
that
i
was
returned
against
this
petitioner
in
1949
charging
him
with
two
counts.
count
number
one
was
commission
of
the
act
of
bank
robbery
under
aggravated
circumstances.
count
number
two
was
entry
of
the
bank
to
commit
the
robbery.
trial
was
held
and
the
evidence
show
that
he
had
entered
the
bank
at
malone,
texas
during
daylight
hours,
during
regular
business
hours
through
a
duly
designated
entrance
without
any
force
or
violence
as
other
people
had
done
familiar
to
customer
while
where
he
was
invited.
while
there,
he
asked
certain
directions
of
a
bank
officer.
he
was
given
directions.
he
then
displayed
the
weapon
and
consummated
the
act
of
bank
robbery
which
is
prohibited
by
subsection
(d)
of
the
act
under
aggravated
circumstances.
he
was
sentenced
after
being
found
guilty
for
20
years
on
entering
the
bank
or
the
robbery
forcing
thereof
and
15
years
on
the
second
count
which
is
the
entry
with
intent,
these
sentences
to
run
consecutively
or
for
a
total
of
35
years.
he
is
now
serving
the
20-year
sentence,
a
motion
to
enlarge
--
mr.
joseph
p.
jenkins
the
maximum
punishment,
well,
that's
the
crux
of
this
case.
mr.
joseph
p.
jenkins
major
crime
in
my
opinion,
if
the
court
please,
in
a
typical
bank
robbery
is
subsection
(d)
or
25
years.
now,
a
motion
to
enlarge
has
been
--
mr.
joseph
p.
jenkins
he
is
now
serving
the
20-year
sentence
which
has
been
imposed
on
the
actual
crime
of
bank
robbery.
the
court
could
have
given
him
25
years
but
chose
to
give
him
20.
he
is
now
serving
that
level
with
penitentiary.
mr.
joseph
p.
jenkins
no.
mr.
joseph
p.
jenkins
under
rule
35,
a
motion
can
be
filed
any
time
--
mr.
joseph
p.
jenkins
--
to
correct
in
legal
sentence.
mr.
joseph
p.
jenkins
and
this
motion
was
filed
in
the
sentencing
court
under
rule
--
mr.
joseph
p.
jenkins
no,
that's
not
the
problem
at
all.
mr.
joseph
p.
jenkins
the
maximum
on
the
second
count
is
20
years.
a
motion
to
enlarge
is
in
the
record
and
that
was
--
it
was
granted
by
the
court
and
the
last
four
pages
of
the
record
pertain
to
how
the
bank
was
entered
which
is
important
we
believe
in
this
case.
and
as
referred
to
by
both
the
government's
brief
and
the
petitioner's
brief
at
the
supplemental
record,
it's
actually
pages
17
to
20.
now,
in
1955,
a
motion
to
correct
or
modify
in
legal
sentence
was
filed
under
rule
35
with
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
it
was
overruled
by
the
trial
court,
judge
ben
rice
presiding.
it
was
appealed
to
the
fifth
circuit.
your
honor,
it
was
affirmed
and
certiorari
was
granted
by
this
court
last
june.
the
contentions
of
the
petitioner
are
two-fold.
first,
that
when
congress
enacted
the
1937
amendment
to
the
bank
robbery
act,
they
did
not
intend
to
cover
anything
but
burglary
and
larceny.
burglary
being
in
a
tradition
or
classic
form
or
in
the
form
under
the
modern
statutes
and
it
was
not
intended
to
cover
mere
peaceable
entry
of
a
bank
walking
in
the
front
doors
in
this
case.
and
secondly,
that
if
this
court
feels
that
this
particular
type
of
crime
or
entry
is
within
the
purview
of
the
1937
amendment
in
any
event
when
the
culminated
act,
when
the
intended
act
is
completed.
congress
isn't
interested
in
sensing
for
both
but
merges
into
the
completed
act
particularly
when
the
25
years
sentence
is
imposed
under
subsection
(a)
of
the
act,
that
being
we
submit
to
this
court,
the
maximum
penalty
accessible
under
the
bank
robbery
act,
sections,
(a),
(b)
and
(d),
leaving
out
kidnapping
and
murder
which
are
covered
in
other
subsections.
but
the
traditional,
the
classic
form
of
bank
robbery
is
covered
in
(a),
(b)
and
(d)
of
the
statute.
now,
the
point
a,
my
first
point
refers
to
what
did
the
1937
amendment
to
the
act
cover.
now,
the
government
in
its
brief
rather
oddly,
i
believe,
submits
that
this
court
doesn't
have
to
go
behind
the
statute
but
can
just
read
the
words
and
that
words
themselves
will
show
what
the
intent
of
the
congress
was.
i
heard
just
in
this
court
yesterday
that
we
cannot
apply
artificial,
mechanistic
reasoning
to
interpreting
words
of
a
statute
like
the
hieroglyphics
of
shorthand.
we
must
go
behind
the
statute
to
determine
what
is
the
intent
of
congress.
this
--
the
history
of
this
act
is
very
revealing.
the
1934
act
only
included
robbery
by
force
and
violence
and
then
if
it
was
committed
under
aggravated
circumstances,
a
--
an
additional
sentence
was
then
imposable.
they
had
requested
the
attorney
general
that
this
act
include
larceny
and
burglary,
but
for
some
reason,
the
congress
did
not
deem
that.
it
should
be
so
and
did
not
enact
that
procedure.
now,
in
1937,
this
was
found
to
be
a
mistake.
this
act
was
not
all-inclusive
and
something
else
should
be
added
to
the
act
and
this
was
done.
the
attorney
general
directed
a
letter
to
the
speaker
of
the
house
and
he
said
that
he
wanted
this
act
amended
to
include
burglary
and
larceny.
and
he
submitted
a
--
a
draft
of
proposed
legislation
in
which
he
uses
the
words
entry
with
intent.
now,
the
house
judiciary
committee
and
the
senate
committee
reported
favorably
on
the
bill,
both
of
their
reports
referred
to
the
bill
as
an
act
to
amend
the
bank
robbery
act
to
include
burglary
and
larceny.
there
were
some
debates
on
the
floor
between
representative
rankin
and
wolcott
and
both
of
them
referred
to
the
act
as
burglary.
they
used
the
word
breaking
and
entering
no
less
than
five
times
when
--
when
the
act
was
read
to
the
--
to
the
house,
to
the
floor,
the
clerk
used
the
words,
enact
to
amend
the
bank
robbery
statute
to
include
burglary
and
larceny.
the
request
of
the
attorney
general
was
heeded
and
the
act
was
enacted,
but
nowhere
in
any
of
the
history,
debates,
letters,
reports
was
there
anything
said,
this
act
should
include
burglary
under
the
circumstances
here
if
that
is
at
all
burglary.
now,
was
there
any
intention
to
increase
the
penalties
under
the
ac,
now,
was
there
any
intention
to
redefine
burglary
far
beyond
any
concept
that
i
know
in
the
state
courts
or
any
concept
known
in
the
federal
courts.
now,
for
some
reason,
the
courts,
some
of
the
courts
below,
there
are
just
a
few
of
them
that
have
interpreted
the
statute,
have
felt
that
peaceful
entry
is
burglary
and
that
this
particular
part
of
the
statute
means
that
peaceful
entry
is
prohibited.
if
the
necessary
animus
is
present,
even
though
a
person
may
abandon
his
intent,
he
is
still
committed
the
crime.
he
is
a
felon,
even
though
the
act
itself
has
no
--
no
intention
whatsoever
of
that
purpose.
now,
burglary,
we
all
know
is
a
very
serious
crime,
particularly
the
old
classic
form
of
burglary
in
the
nighttime
with
--
of
dwelling
house
with
occupants.
but
our
modern
versions
have
redefined
burglary,
so
that
now,
today,
burglary
may
be
entrance
without
force
of
a
place
in
the
daytime.
but
there
was
always
the
element
of
trespass
involved.
in
my
home
state
of
kansas,
there
are
four
degrees
of
burglary,
but
the
least
of
the
degrees,
the
fourth
degree,
is
far
more
serious
than
merely
walking
in
a
bank
where
the
public
is
invited
with
the
necessary
animus.
the
government
contends
that
this
statute
is
modeled
after
section
190
of
the
penal
code.
what
does
that
section
say?
breaking
and
entering
a
post
office
with
the
intent
to
commit
a
felony
therein,
breaking
and
entering.
we
submit
that
if
this
court
feels
that
this
statute
covers
peaceful
entry,
even
though
the
legislature
meant
burglary
and
larceny
and
clearly
pass
the
act
to
cover
that
and
the
attorney
general
requested
that,
we'll
be
going
far
beyond
the
ordinary
concepts
of
burglary.
now,
the
penalty
is
20
years
according
to
the
statute.
now,
that's
in
line
with
the
regular
burglary
of
penalties
in
most
of
the
states.
the
most
serious
form
of
burglary,
however,
first
degree
of
burglary
is
usually
20
years,
maybe
25.
my
state
is
20.
but
fourth
degree
is
one
of
five
in
my
state.
it
has
a
more
serious
crime
than
walking
the
bank,
in
20
years,
can
be
had
in
this
particular
instance.
furthermore,
burglary
is
considered
under
this
statute.
entry
is
more
serious
than
larceny.
so
a
person
may
steal
a
$100,000
from
a
bank
and
he
can
get
10
years
under
the
statute.
if
he
enters
the
bank,
intending
to
steal
a
fountain
pen
because
--
because
larceny
is
a
misdemeanor
under
the
statute,
he
can
still
get
20
years
for
entering
the
bank,
theoretically,
and
addition
of
one
year
for
the
larceny
if
consummated.
if
not
consummated,
he
can
still
get
20
years
and
inconceivable.
robbery,
under
the
act,
subsection
(a),
without
a
dangerous
weapon,
but
the
words
force
and
violence
is
used
and
intimidation
carries
a
crime
or
whether
a
sentence
of
20
years.
entry
is
also
20
years.
i
believe
it
is
clear
that
the
--
that
burglary
in
its
traditional
form
or
its
redefined
form
as
most
of
the
state
courts
have
now
done,
legislatures
was
meant
and
not
mere
peaceful
entry.
the
maximum
we
submit
is
25
--
25
years
under
the
statute
which
is
aggravated
form
of
robbery.
now,
we
believe
that
the
penal
statute
must
be
strictly
construed
against
the
government
and
as
justice
frank
said,
a
penal
statute
is
not
to
be
generously
construed
in
favor
of
the
government.
well,
as
to
point
b,
in
the
event
the
government
feels,
this
court
feels,
the
government
will
certainly
does
so
feel,
that
peaceable
entry
was
included
under
the
statute.
what
does
it
mean?
justice
huxman
said
this,
in
cases
not
similar
to
this,
this
particular
provision
was
enacted
to
provide
the
omission
in
a
case
where
a
party
enters
the
bank
intending
to
commit
a
felony
and
then
abandons
his
purpose
or
as
apprehend
before
he
commits
it,
not
to
cover
this
particular
type
of
situation.
if
the
petitioner
is
wrong,
this
particular
amendment,
1937,
which
is
part
of
--
of
the
act
today,
the
1940
act,
it
act
--
merely
consolidated
the
earlier
act,
if
the
petitioner
is
wrong,
not
only
was
this
act
expanded,
which
is
--
it
seems
to
be
the
motivating
force
behind
it,
but
the
penalties
have
been
increased,
even
though
the
attorney
general
has
showed
no
interest
in
increasing
the
penalties.
under
the
interpretation
of
the
fifth
circuit,
a
man
can
get
55
to
60
years
for
the
traditional
form
of
bank
robbery
without
hurting
anyone
and
he
can
get
21
years
or,
say,
30
years,
we
can
juggle
the
statute
in
all
different
ways
for
entering
a
bank
and
maybe
stealing
$101
and
we
don't
believe
that's
the
intent
of
the
legislature.
mr.
joseph
p.
jenkins
if
--
mr.
joseph
p.
jenkins
if
it
was
done,
it
is
in
the
power
of
congress
to
place
any
sentence
it
wishes
on
any
act.
mr.
joseph
p.
jenkins
we
believe
that
it
is
a
matter
of
--
of
statutory
construction,
but
however,
it
has
amounted
to
double
jeopardy
because
i'm
going
to
--
it
has
amounted
to
double
jeopardy
and
that
we
don't
believe
that
congress
meant,
these
two
particular
acts
to
be
subdivided,
i
was
getting
to
that
point,
so
that
the
commission
of
one
is
a
separate
crime
from
the
commission
of
the
other.
we've
mentioned
that
in
the
court
below
but
we
still
feel
that
does
involve
statutory
construction.
mr.
joseph
p.
jenkins
i
feel
that
--
mr.
joseph
p.
jenkins
i
believe
--
i
believe
there
is
a
question
of
constitutionality.
mr.
joseph
p.
jenkins
yes,
your
honor,
i
certainly
do.
but
as
i
have
stated
with
honor,
the
question
is
somewhat
integrated
with
construction
of
the
statute
and
intent
and
it's
hard
to
say
whether
we
can
separate
the
two
or
not.
if
the
statute
is
being
construed
wrongly,
there
is
double
jeopardy.
that's
the
only
way
i
can
look
at
it.
mr.
joseph
p.
jenkins
then
there
would
be
no
question.
mr.
joseph
p.
jenkins
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
p.
jenkins
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
p.
jenkins
i
believe
you
--
please,
very
well.
mr.
joseph
p.
jenkins
that's
the
--
mr.
joseph
p.
jenkins
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
p.
jenkins
that's
correct.
i
--
my
opposition
is
that
(a)
and
(b)
are
actually
four
separate
and
distinct
offenses,
all
of
which
fall
into
subsection
(d)
if
the
crimes
are
committed
--
mr.
joseph
p.
jenkins
--
as
aggravated
crimes.
mr.
joseph
p.
jenkins
i
say
no.
mr.
joseph
p.
jenkins
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
p.
jenkins
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
p.
jenkins
no,
i'm
raising
a
question
that
statutory
construction
will
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
subsections
(a)
and
(b)
of
the
act
contained
four
separate
and
distinct
crimes,
each
of
which
will
stand
by
itself
and
will
not
integrate
in
the
others
that
congress
meant
four
separate
crimes
to
be
involved
here
and
that
--
if
one
crime
is
committed,
the
other
crime
cannot.
for
example,
petit
larceny
and
grand
larceny,
they
can't
stand
together.
robbery,
taking
a
property
and
petit
larceny,
no
court
has
ever
held
they
can
stand
together
in
the
bank
robbery
act,
but
we
have
taken
away
the
--
the
one
concept
of
entry
and
placed
that
by
itself
and
say
that
can
be
added
to
any
of
the
other
act
so
that
we
can
have
two
crimes
committed
at
(a)
and
(d)
--
(a)
and
(b).
we'll
i'd
say,
and
i
believe
and
the
other
courts
have
so
held,
that
only
one
crime
can
be
--
can
be
committed
under
(a)
and
(b)
and
if
it's
an
aggravated
form,
it
merges
into
--
mr.
joseph
p.
jenkins
--
(d).
mr.
joseph
p.
jenkins
no,
i
--
i
would
--
i
would
say
this
that
a
smacks
of
double
jeopardy,
and
a
person
being
sentenced
twice
for
one
crime.
the
courts
have
held
that
have
interpreted
--
mr.
joseph
p.
jenkins
well,
i
believe
it
would
be
under
the
fifth
amendment,
yes.
and
i
--
i
urge
that
point
below.
now
--
mr.
joseph
p.
jenkins
i
might
have,
your
honor.
i
might
have.
i
wasn't
going
to
press
that
point
on
this
short
time
i
have
here.
now,
if
your
honor
please,
the
courts
below
have
held
over
and
over
again
the
that
(a)
and
(d)
are
only
one
crime,
is
a
massive
citations
in
the
--
both
briefs
that
(a)
and
(d)
cannot
stand
together,
but
these
all
have
referred
to
the
robbery,
prohibited
in
(a)
and
then
(d),
the
same
robbery
under
aggravated
circumstance
and
the
courts
have
held
unanimously
one
crime
with
the
25
years
sentence
including
this
court
whether
obliquely
perhaps
in
holiday
v.
johnston,
when
it
was
sent
back
to
lower
court
to
change
the
sentence.
the
courts
have
--
maximum
to
being
25
years.
now,
the
courts
have
even
held
that
when
seven
or
eight
persons
are
in
--
put
in
jeopardy
that
only
one
count
will
stand
because
the
maximum
again
is
25
years
under
this
act.
however,
the
--
the
particular
question
involved
here
when
entry
not
under
aggravated
circumstances
is
charged
and
then,
the
bank
robbery,
under
aggravated
circumstances,
those
are
(a)
and
(d)
crimes,
the
fifth,
sixth
and
ninth
circuit
have
met
the
problem
head
on.
only
the
fifth
of
all
the
courts
has
held
that
an
--
an
aggravated
entry
will
stand
with
aggravated
robbery
so
that
a
person
may
be
sentenced
to
a
maximum
of
45
years,
while
the
sixth
circuit
has
said,
no,
there
is
a
merger
into
the
--
into
(d),
a
maximum
of
25
years.
and
the
ninth
circuit
has
held
that
similarly,
except
in
dictum
because
they
sent
the
case
back
to
the
--
to
the
trial
judges,
there
were
two
of
them,
and
simply
said
that
they
had
no
jurisdiction,
hard
case
of
the
quicksand
of
law,
you
should
apply
for
executive
clemency.
clearly
holding
that
there
is
a
merger
of
(a)
and
(a)
crime
has
committed
into
(d),
particularly
entry
with
intent.
but
the
fifth
circuit
has
held
if
the
entry
with
intent
is
not
committed
under
aggravated
circumstances,
then
it
will
not
merge
into
(d)
which
simply
means
that
if
you
commit
the
entry
with
--
with
aggravated
circumstance
and
walk
in
and
threaten
a
guard
when
you
walk
in
and
then
commit
the
robbery
under
aggravated
circumstances,
they
will
both
merge
into
subsection
(d).
but
if
you
don't
commit
the
entry
under
aggravated
circumstances,
they
won't
merge,
which
means
a
more
serious
penalty
for
the
lesser
crime.
and
if
this
is
hard
to
believe,
on
page
17,
or
rather
in
the
brief
in
pages
37,
the
court
has
quoted
and
this
only
shows
the
confusion
may
arise
if
we
interpret
this
as
separate
crimes
is
inconceivable
that
a
person
who
enters
a
bank
under
unaggravated
circumstances
can
be
sentenced
to
a
heavier
sentence
than
one
who
does
enter
the
bank
under
aggravated
circumstances
and
then
commits
the
robbery.
the
court
truly
held
below
that
that
could
be
done.
now,
the
fifth
circuit
has
also
held
just
last
year
that
there
is
a
merger,
holding
my
point
of
view.
however,
in
my
case
when
i
stressed
heflin
case
to
them,
they
said
that
the
government
had
conceded
the
error.
and
since
the
government
conceded
the
error,
they
felt
that
was
not
--
they
were
not
bound
by
their
own
decision.
when
again
they
said,
and
this
court
has
said,
the
maximum
penalty
under
(a),
(b)
and
(d)
which
covers
the
classic
bank
robbery
is
25
years.
in
this
case,
35
years
was
imposed.
now,
i
submit
and
--
and
this
might
answer
the
questions
put
to
me
that
congress
meant
to
cover
omissions,
huxman
and
frank
said
so.
in
dissenting
opinions
huxman
--
rather
frank
was
upheld
by
this
court
in
the
jerome
versus
united
states.
it
--
it
supplies
an
omission
in
a
certain
kind
of
case.
that
is,
of
course,
if
we
--
if
we
say
peaceful
entries
in
the
first
place
intended
to
be
covered.
we
have
four
separate
distinct
crimes
which
can
be
put
in
place
in
compartments.
if
anyone
has
committed,
then
that
particular
crime
would
be
the
only
crime
chargeable.
if
it
is
committed
on
aggravated
circumstances,
it
then
merged
into
(d).
now,
in
our
particular
instance,
i
believe
that
congress
never
intended
to
--
to
place
prohibitions
against
successive
steps
in
this
transaction.
they
intended
to
supply
an
omission.
when
the
transaction
finally
consummate
in
the
intended
act,
it
is
the
submission
of
the
petitioner
that
that's
what
congress
wanted
and
therefore
there
is
a
merger
so
that
the
intended
act
is
the
one
upon
which
sentence
can
be
imposed
and
i
believe
no
matter
how
we
look
at
the
legislative
history,
no
matter
how
we
examine
this
particular
act,
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
congress
intended
any
type
of
permitting
as
is
done
in
this
case
and
as
can
be
done
in
another
cases
instead
of
the
25-year
sentence.
judge
edgerton
once
said
that,
in
king
v.
united
states,
that
sentencing
should
not
be
a
game
in
which
the
wrong
move
by
the
court
will
grant
immunity
to
the
prisoner.
we
have
the
same
thing
here
just
reversed.
the
prosecutor
can
by
manipulation
of
the
various
sections
of
the
statute,
that
is
of
each
one
of
those
crimes
in
(a)
and
(b)
can
be
charged
in
addition
to
other
crimes
in
(a)
and
(b)
by
merely
manipulating
the
section
of
the
statute,
we
can
get
sentences
varying
50
to
60
years
depending
upon
the
ingenuity
of
the
prosecutor.
yet,
this
hasn't
been
done.
the
courts
have
seemed
to
interpret
this
reasonably,
except
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
particular
type
of
case.
there
are
no
cases
anywhere
in
our
--
among
our
circuits
that
hold
that
what
this
fifth
circuit
has
done
in
this
case
can
be
done
in
any
other
type
of
bank
robbery
case.
so
if
the
court
please,
we
feel
that
--
that
the
maximum
sentence
is
25
years
imposable
under
this
act.
now,
armed
robbery,
which
is
a
serious
crime,
the
general
prohibition
against
it
will
carry
a
sentence
of
about
25
years.
that's
if
no
murder
was
done
or
any
other
harm,
25
years.
it
does
not
seem
conceivable
that
congress
intended
the
bank
robbery
act
to
go
beyond
25
years
when
no
kidnapping
or
killing
is
involved.
yet,
that's
what
can
be
done
if
the
prosecutor
and
some
of
our
district
judges
are
giving
a
license
to
pyramid
these
offenses
far
beyond
25
years
which
seems
to
be
reasonable.
this
court
itself
has
said
in
the
holiday
case,
the
maximum
sentence
imposable
under
the
bank
robbery
act,
of
course,
in
that
case,
we
had
robbery
and
then
aggravated
robbery,
and
the
court
said
you
couldn't
sentence
on
both,
but
the
maximum
sentence
is
25
years
and
this
court
has
never
changed
its
view
and
no
other
court
in
united
states
has
changed
its
view
except
the
fifth
circuit
and
even
that
court,
just
last
year
held
that
25
years
was
the
maximum
sentence,
why
it
change
its
mind
in
our
case,
i
do
not
know,
but
when
this
was
pointed
out,
the
court
refused
to
follow
its
own
decision.
now
--
now,
if
the
court
please,
we
submit
finally
that
armed
robbery
under
aggravated
circumstances
which
contains
a
maximum
sentence
imposable
embraces
the
entry.
congress,
i
believe,
would
be
satisfied
if
this
entry
were
embraced
within
the
act.
i
can
use
the
word
merger.
there
is
no
intent
to
increase
the
penalties
merely
to
cover
the
--
or
expand
the
act
to
include
another
type
of
crime
which
is
larceny
and
burglary.
so,
as
justice
hudson
once
said,
nothing
is
a
crime
unless
specifically
made
so
by
a
statute.
crimes
do
not
arise
by
implication
and
that
is
what
we
have
here.
we
submit
to
your
honors
first
that
burglary
was
meant
to
be
covered
by
the
clear
intention
of
congress
and
if
this
court
feels
that
burglary
should
be
expanded
to
include
a
peaceable
type
of
entry
which
i
submit
is
unheard-of
under
this
type
of
case
because
everyone
has
a
right
to
go
into
a
bank,
then
in
any
event
a
merger
was
held
because
the
maximum
sentence
is
25
years.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
p.
jenkins
one
minute,
yes,
your
honor.
