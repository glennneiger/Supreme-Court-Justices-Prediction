well,
i'm
--
i
meant
you
are
--
it's
clearly
what
the
purport
of
your
ends
for
justice
harlan's
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
there
is
a
question
of
constitutionality
or
do
you
disallowed
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
you
mean
to
say
if
--
if
it
should
be
construed
if
not
allowed
sentences
for
both,
cumulative
sentences
for
both,
when
congress
disallowed
it
and
rends
it
--
that
if
a
court
goes
wrong
to
allow
that
or
you're
wrong
to
prevail
with
amounts
of
punishment
for
something
that's
--
in
relation
of
punishment,
but
suppose
congress
explicitly
say
in
this
case,
20
years
or
15
years
for
one
and
20
years
for
the
next.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there'd
be
no
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
question
of
double
jeopardy,
wouldn't
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
say
that
the
same
were
severed
and
therefore,
it's
a
matter
of
construction,
they
made
construction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you're
--
when
you're
saying
these
cases,
ms.
rosenberg,
how
--
how
many
--
what
--
what
litigation
or
adjudication
has
there
been
in
the
district
court
or
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
this
very
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
generalities,
i
don't
know
why
--
why
everyone
spent
so
much
time
when
justice
holmes
said
wildly.
practically,
every
question
of
statutory
construction
is
unique
problem.
these
generalities
don't
you
get
anything.
of
course,
congress
has
that
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
bill
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
this
bill?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
your
own
recitals,
ms.
rosenberg,
shows
that
the
mental
climate
changes
even
more
than
the
mere
erotical
climate.
the
lower
court
said
there
were
two
offenses,
robbery
and
aggravated,
because
they
were
still
moving
in
this
mental
--
in
this
adverse
here
which
you
speak.
but
by
the
time,
holiday
and
johnston,
the
holiday
case
statute
with
--
in
313,
the
air
here
began
to
be
a
little
different.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
mean
by
that
handled
--
what
do
you
mean
by
handled
in
the
sentencing
procedures?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
paragraph
(d)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
it?
