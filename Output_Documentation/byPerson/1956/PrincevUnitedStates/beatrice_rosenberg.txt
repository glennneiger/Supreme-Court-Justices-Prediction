ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
we're
dealing
here
with
a
statute
first
that's
1934
and
amended
by
the
material
here
in
1937.
when
that
statute
was
proceeded
by
a
number
of
decisions
of
this
court
ranging
by
--
from
the
burton
case
about
1905
through
the
albrecht
case
in
273
united
states,
must
have
been
in
that
--
in
that
period
about
10
decisions
dealing
with
the
question
of
whether
one
transaction
resulted
in
one
offense
or
more
than
one
offense.
and
the
court
in
that
30-year
period
spoke
not
only
frequently
but
unequivocally
consistently.
and
it
is
our
basic
position
here
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
or
the
language
of
this
statute
to
take
it
out
of
those
decisions.
but
those
decisions
must
--
cannot
be
ignored
when
you're
trying
to
decide
with
intent
of
the
legislature
in
1937
with
respect
to
a
bill
suggested
by
the
attorney
general
and
that
in
the
light
of
those
decisions,
entry
with
intent
to
rob
and
a
robbery
are
separate
in
distinct
offenses
and
separately
punishable.
now,
out
of
the
many
decisions
that
were
decided
in
this
period
between
1905
and
1937,
(inaudible)
should
i
want
to
talk
about
in
particular
because
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
they
established
as
the
regular
method
of
interpreting
federal
criminal
statutes.
the
proposition
that
where
a
statute
rebating
to
what
would
normally
be
a
series
of
steps
in
one
transaction,
the
act
would
normally
be
interpreted
as
punishing
each
step
as
well
as
the
completed
transaction
itself.
in
the
first
decision
to
that
effect,
burton
against
the
united
states
in
202
u.s.,
where
the
statute
punished,
in
just
one
paragraph,
anyone
who
shall
agree
to
receive
or
receive
any
compensation
of
the
type
prohibited,
burton
case
discussed
on
page
17
of
our
brief.
and
the
court
there
said,
congress
intended
place
its
condemnation
upon
each
distinct,
separate
part
of
every
transaction
coming
within
the
messages
intended
to
be
reached
and
remedied.
therefore,
an
agreement
to
receive
compensation
was
made
an
offense.
and
so
the
receiving
of
compensation
in
violation
of
the
statute
whether
pursuant
to
the
previous
agreement
or
not
was
made
another
in
separate
offense.
there
is
in
our
judgment
no
escape
from
this
interpretation
consistently
with
the
established
rule
that
the
intention
of
a
legislature
must
govern.
now,
i
looked
the
briefs
in
those
cases
and
the
decision
of
the
court
itself
and
the
intention
of
the
legislature
so
far
as
it
is
manifested
by
the
briefs
or
the
opinion
stems
from
no
more
than
the
words
of
the
statute
itself
which
i
said
in
the
beginning
prohibited
any
member
of
congress
who
“shall
receive
or
agree
to
receive
any
compensation.”
then
in
237
united
states,
we
come
to
a
case
that's
very
much
in
point
to
the
problem
here.
morgan
against
devine
dealing
with
the
post
office
statute
that
post
office
offense
is
defined
in
one
paragraph
forcible
entry
with
intent
to
commit
a
felony
--
no,
with
intent
to
commit
larceny
--
what
was
section
190
of
the
criminal
code.
in
another
paragraph,
larceny,
the
post
office
matter
and
the
third
paragraph
which
was
not
involved
in
morgan
against
devine
also
had
a
robbery
statute
with
provision
for
increased
punishment
for
the
aggravated
crime.
and
to
that
particular
problem
of
burglary
followed
by
a
larceny,
there
was
that
the
opinion
below
admits
a
conflict
in
the
federal
courts
and
an
even
greater
conflict
as
there
is
quite
generally
even
now
among
the
state
as
to
when
one
transaction
--
well,
when
it
becomes
one
offense
or
two,
whether
one
merges
in
the
other.
and
the
court
had
argued
to
it
and
dealt
specifically
with
the
argument
that
after
all
what
was
involved
in
one
post-office
theft
was
--
that
any
intent
at
the
time
of
entry
was
exactly
the
intent
at
the
time
of
the
stealing.
and
in
answer
to
that,
the
court
said,
it's
quoted
at
page
15
in
our
brief,
the
test
is
not
whether
the
criminal
intent
is
one
other
thing
inspiring
the
whole
transaction,
but
whether
separate
acts
have
been
committed
with
the
requisite
criminal
intent
and
are
such
as
are
made
punishable
by
the
act
of
congress.
and
the
very
case
to
which
i
was
to
refer
as
the
case
of
albrecht
against
united
states
dealing
with
violations
of
the
national
prohibition
act,
which
in
one
paragraph
punished
possession,
manufacture,
sale,
receipt,
almost
anything
that
we
don't
have
in
relation
to
intoxicating
liquor.
mr.
albrecht
was
punished
or
was
charged
an
indictment
with
on
the
same
day
possession
of
liquor
and
sale
of
liquor.
and
the
actual
proof
that
was
adduced
was
that
somebody
went
in
and
ordered
a
drink
and
he
went
in
the
back
and
got
out
a
bottle
and
gave
him
the
drink.
that
was
the
proof
related
to
the
possession
and
sale
at
the
same
time.
and
the
argument
was
made
that
that
was
not
--
those
--
those
were
not
separate
offenses
and
that
since
it
was
almost
impossible
to
separate
possession
and
the
sale,
that
you
couldn't
make
a
sale
without
having
possession,
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
constitutional
protection
in
double
jeopardy.
and
in
answer
to
that,
this
court
said
there
was
nothing
in
the
constitution,
that's
quoted
on
page
18
of
our
brief,
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
which
prevents
congress
from
punishing
separately
each
step
leading
to
the
consummation
of
a
transaction
which
it
has
power
to
prohibit
and
punishing
also
the
completed
transaction.
now,
that
(inaudible)
in
constitutional
terms,
but
of
course,
to
reach
the
constitutional
problem,
there
also
has
to
be
a
statutory
construction
problem.
it
must
have
been
--
it
employs
a
holding,
of
course,
that
congress
did
to
intend
to
punish
separately
the
possession
and
the
sale
of
liquor.
from
--
we
haven't
attempted
in
our
brief
to
summarize
the
--
i
think
literally
hundred
of
court
of
appeals
cases
which
follow
the
principles
laid
down
by
the
courts
in
these
cases.
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
on
this
very
statute,
i
was
coming
to
that,
your
honor.
i'm
going
to
take
it
up
now.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
it's
more
than
the
power,
your
honor.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
and
the
congressional
intent
in
1937
cannot
be
judge
without
referring
to
the
climate
of
legal
thinking
of
the
time.
after
all,
it
is
a
well-known
fact
that
congress
consists
in
the
part
of
lawyers.
this
was
a
bill
that
was
drafted
by
the
attorney
general
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
and
submitted
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
this
bill.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
this
bill.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
this
retained
over,
if
this
were
the
first
criminal
statute
that
was
called
upon
to
be
construed,
it
could
be
regarded
equivocal,
i
regard
every
one
of
these
decisions
by
this
court
as
subject
to
arguments,
one
way
or
one
another,
various
states
have
gone
various
ways
on
this.
it
seems
to
me
very
valid
and
--
and
very
important,
both
as
a
matter
of
legislative
intent,
as
a
legislative
intent
of
this
statute
to
recognize
that
there
was
a
climate
of
judicial
thinking
which
presumably
the
attorney
general
knew
and
--
and
the
members
of
congress.
and
that
when
you
get
to
a
statute
where
it
seems
to
me
neither
the
wording
nor
the
legislative
history
per
se
is
conclusive,
it
is
very
significant
that
for
the
whole
30
years
preceding,
that
was
the
almost
automatic
approach
of
a
court
to
this
problem
so
much,
though
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
that
i
will
come
to
in
a
moment
taking
up
this
particular
statute.
when
they
had
a
statute
which
was
different
in
one
respect,
and
this
was
in
relation
to
robbery.
most
courts
didn't
recognize
the
difference.
so
that
we
had
the
problem
that
arose
about
holiday
against
johnston,
which
came
from
a
particular
format
was
enacted.
it
--
it
--
let
me
turn
now
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
to
explain
what
i
mean.
when
the
attorney
general
suggested
in
1934,
he
suggested
a
draft
which
is
appendix
a
of
our
brief
on
page
46.
and
that
read,
there
was
a
section
punishing,
driving
into
the
bank
with
intent
to
commit
a
felony,
common
law
of
burglary.
it
was
section
4
(a)
punishing
robbery
and
4
(b)
with
section
3,
punishing
burglary,
section
4
punishing
robbery.
and
it
had
robbery
in
the
simple
form,
robbery
in
the
aggravated
form.
and
i
had
forgotten,
i
started
at
3,
i
should
have
started
at
2
which
was
the
section
punishing
larceny.
so
we
had
one
section
punishing
larceny,
one
section
punishing
burglary,
one
section
punishing
robbery,
which
(a)
and
(b)
had
the
simple
in
the
aggravated
form
with
the
greater
offense.
for
some
reason
not
disclosed
in
the
legislative
history,
congress
omitted
in
1934,
congress
decided
not
to
make
bank
burglary
or
bank
larceny
an
offense
and
it
passed
only
the
robbery
part
as
a
proposed
draft.
and
so
we
got
what
was
12
united
states
code
in
the
form
before
the
1948
revision,
588
(a)
and
(b),
passed
as
such,
so
we
had
--
without
--
the
robbery
provision
alone
with
a
provision
for
aggravated
form
and
not
the
others
which
would
made
it
clear
that
they
were
creating
separate
offenses.
now,
i
think
that
the
bill
had
been
passed
in
--
in
its
original
form.
it
would
never
have
gotten
into
the
difficulties
that
it
did
because
as
with
the
separate
burglary
provision,
the
separate
larceny
provision
and
then
the
robbery
provision
simple
and
aggravated.
it
was
clear
from
the
language
of
the
statute.
one,
that
the
aggravated
form
of
robbery
related
to
robbery
and
also
i
think
clear
from
the
form
of
that
statute
in
the
light
of
the
decisions
of
the
time
that
burglary
and
larceny
was
separate
from
the
robbery.
but
coming
as
it
did
with
just
the
robbery
and
with
the
general
approach
of
separate
statutes
being
separate
offenses
which
had
permeated
federal
thinking
for
30
years
before
this
statute
was
passed.
what
happened
was
that
the
great
majority
of
district
courts
began
to
consider
both
robbery
and
aggravated
robbery
as
separate
offenses
also
and
that
was
the
form
in
which
the
statute
read
when
holiday
against
johnson
or
at
least
at
the
time
of
a
holiday
against
johnson
offense
by
this
court.
and
at
that
time
when
only
robbery
was
punished
by
the
statute,
this
court
said,
“no,
that's
just
one
offense.”
and
the
government,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
agreed
to
that
interpretation,
but
it
was
talking
about
the
situation
where
we
had
what
was
originally
section
4
of
the
draft,
simply
robbery
in
the
initial
and
aggravated
form.
and
it
was,
in
a
sense,
the
result
in
confusion
from
being
faced
with
a
statute
where
the
court
has
said,
it
was
only
offense
which
was
extremely
unusual
in
federal
law
that
we
get
some
of
the
problems
here.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
may
i
suggest,
your
honor,
in
that
the
court
of
appeals
that
they
had
it,
did
not
do
so.
it
was
largely
based
on
the
legislative
history
and
based
on
the
particular
legislative
history
represented
by
appendix
a
where
i
think,
as
i
said,
that
in
the
form
that
--
if
that
statute
had,
where
you
have
section
2
or
section
3
and
where
the
aggravated
form
applied
only
to
larceny,
it
would
have
been
done
and
after
the
change
of
climate.
i
was
coming
to
that
later
because
of
the
period
between
1937
and
1948.
may
i
point
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
1947
in
michener
against
the
united
states,
where
--
what
was
involved
was
a
15
years
sentence
for
possession
of
a
counterfeit
plate
and
a
15-year
sentence
for
causing
a
counterfeit
plate
to
have
been
made.
now,
the
eighth
circuit
in
a
very
limited
decision
said,
“we
agree
the
possession
and
manufacture
can
often
be
separate
offenses.
but
where
the
only
possession
you
charge
is
that
the
very
same
time
as
a
possession
of
a
counterfeit
plate
about
to
be
made,
we
think
that
merges.”
now,
that
was
the
conflict
with
the
ninth
circuit.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
was
the
same
defendant
and
that
question
was
brought
here.
now,
as
late
as
1947
with
this
court
with
some
dissents.
but
nevertheless,
this
court
disposed
of
that
question
by
reversing
the
eighth
circuit
in
a
per
curiam
opinion
citing
the
cases
that
i
have
mentioned
before
including
those
i
haven't
undertaken
to
discuss
here,
gavieres
and
some
of
the
others
that
are
cited
in
our
brief.
so
that
if
neither
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
this
statute,
nor
at
the
time
of
the
reenactment
of
the
code
in
1948,
had
there
been
any
significant
change
in
this
general
climate
of
approach
which
was
to
the
effect
that
each
step
of
a
transaction
as
well
as
the
whole
transaction
should
--
could
be
separately
punishable.
there
were,
in
addition,
judicial
constructions
specifically
on
this
point
which
i
won't
get
to
it
at
this
time.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
oh,
i'm
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
sorry,
no
one
told
me.
in
the
years
between
1937
when
this
statute
was
amended
and
1948,
there
were
a
few
cases
on
this
problem.
there
are
notamended
whether
because
they
are
handled
in
the
sentencing
procedure,
i
do
not
know.
but
the
one
case
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
in
that
--
in
that
whether
because
courts
have
not
given
consecutive
sentences
for
this
or
--
i
do
not
know,
but
they
aren't
really
about
--
i
suppose
altogether
about
10
cases
where
the
question
had
been
litigated,
several
of
them
for
the
--
from
the
fifth
circuit.
now,
those
cases
are
discussed
in
our
brief
at
pages
31
to
35.
and
the
most
precise
question,
handling
of
this
question,
precisely
dealing
with
the
question
of
whether
entry
and
the
subsequent
robbery
were
separate
offenses
was
wells
against
the
united
states
in
124,
coming
from
this
same
circuit.
now,
there
we
had
exactly
all
the
difficulties,
the
fact
that
aggravated
robbery
and
robbery
itself
had
been
sentenced
to
separate
sentences
as
well
as
entry
within
intent
to
rob.
and
the
court
said
it
is
true
that
aggravated
--
that
robbery
and
aggravated
robbery
are
separate
offenses
--
are
not
separate
offenses
and
therefore,
you
can
punish
only
one
for
the
aggravated
form.
but
entry,
on
the
other
hand,
is
a
separate
offense
and
for
that,
consecutive
sentences
may
be
imposed
because
that's
in
court
withholding
in
this
case.
i
am
almost
afraid
to
point
out
since
i
am
not
attaching
any
significant
to
it,
but
the
fact
is
that
a
petition
for
certiorari
raising
precisely
that
point
of
whether
there
could
be
an
entrance
with
intent
to
rob
was
presented
to
this
court
and
denied.
now,
there
was
at
that
time
no
(inaudible).
the
other
explicit
holding
on
that
point
was
in
the
tenth
circuit.
it
was
the
same
offense
and
it
was
dicta
when
the
question
was
not
correctly
involved,
but
exclusive
recognition
of
that
same
point
of
view
by
the
seventh
and
the
eighth
circuit.
the
case
is
cited
at
page
33
of
our
brief.
as
against
that,
there
was
one
holding
to
the
contrary
in
a
rather
oblique
case
which
had
complications
in
its
sentence
in
another
form
in
the
sixth
circuit
and
possible
dicta.
it's
not
even
clear
that
the
court
was
ruling
on
this
question
in
the
ninth.
so
that
by
the
time
of
the
reenactment,
the
way
the
judicial
authority
was
in
court
with
--
with
what
was
then
the
prevailing
view
generally
as
federal
criminal
statute
and
that
is
to
the
effect
that
entry
with
intent
to
rob
and
robbery
are
separate
offenses.
now,
let
me
say
that
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
that's
the
difficulty.
you
get
--
it
will
be
traced
best
by
looking
in
our
appendix.
the
first
--
the
act
that
--
was
first
passed
in
1934,
mr.
justice
brennan,
took
what
was
--
as
i
say
the
robbery
section
of
the
proposed
bill
and
that's
set
out
in
appendix
b
on
page
47.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that
came
from
the
1934
act
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
paragraph
(a).
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
take
he
--
from
the
presence
in
presence
of
another.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes,
by
intimidation,
it
takes
from
the
presence
or
presence
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
of
another.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
he
has
to
rob
someone.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
oh,
yes
--
yes.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that
would
be
an
offense
under
paragraph
(a).
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
that's
the
aggravated
form
of
the
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
but
it's
one
offense.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
it's
one
offense.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
only
one
offense.
the
idea
is
that
as
to
paragraph
(d),
the
interpretation
and
then
courts
had
been
completely
consistent
about
this,
that
paragraph
(d)
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
(d)
of
the
present
statute.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
on
page
3,
defines
an
aggravated
form
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
of
whatever
offense
it
applies
to.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
because
the
arrangements
here
can
be
understood
only
in
relation
to
the
history
of
the
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
only
in
relation
to
the
history
of
the
statute.
as
i
say
what
happened
was
that
you
had
first
the
proposal
to
make
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
all
right.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
1937.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
and
then
when
--
but
it
had
been
in
existence
from
--
what
happened
is
that
when
the
statute,
read
(a)
and
(b),
when
the
attorney
general
then
said
to
congress,
“you
made
a
mistake
in
admitting
the
larceny
and
burglary
provisions.”
then
the
statute
then
had
(a)
and
(b)
instead
of
going
back
to
its
old
form
and
suggesting
separate
paragraphs.
if
(a),
he
could
in
the
definitions
of
larceny
and
burglary
and
so
then,
you
get
the
statute.
it
will
seem
even
clearer,
i
think,
why
(d)
got
separate.
if
you
look
at
pages
4
to
5
of
our
brief,
which
is
the
predecessor
statute
as
enacted
in
1937,
and
there
you
see
--
they
said,
whoever
by
--
588
(b),
but
paragraph
(a)
have
the
separate
offenses
burglary,
robbery,
larceny
and
petit
larceny
and
then
it
provided
for
the
increased
punishment
in
the
aggravated
form
of
the
offense.
now,
the
revises
in
1940
(a)
separated
this
(a)
into
the
--
(a)
and
(b)
and
(c),
and
then
they
added
the
(d),
but
it's
--
that's
a
historical
accident
because
it
is
clear
here
that
from
the
predecessor
statute
that
the
offenses
were
divine
first,
and
then
there
was
a
provision
for
increased
punishment
for
the
aggravated
forms
of
the
offense.
and
it
is
that
history
that
we
say
shows
that
in
the
light
of
the
decisions,
in
the
light
of
the
blinking
of
the
time,
these
were
intended
to
be
separate
offenses.
now,
let
me
say
one
word
about
the
peaceful,
the
absence
of
violence
in
this.
it's
hard
for
a
statute
to
be
more
explicit
than
this
one.
it
simply
says
entry.
congress
had
before
it
and
the
attorney
general's
first
suggests
were
forcibly
entry
or
breaking
and
entering.
so
that
the
addition
of
the
simple
word
entry
was
intended,
we
think,
should
be
deliberate.
the
court
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
if
he
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
there'd
be
question
of
when
the
intent
occurred.
i
take
it.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
it
seems
to
us
not
essentially
different
from
agreeing
to
receive
and
receiving
compensation.
normally,
one
doesn't
get
a
bribe
or
under
lawful
compensation
unless
one
agrees
to
take
it.
this
court
has
said
those
are
separate
offenses.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
your
honor,
the
(inaudible)
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
offense
statute
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
allows
congress
defined
it,
congress
defined
it
as
entry.
people
have
gotten
five
years
for
selling
narcotics
not
in
a
blank
order
form,
five
years
--
that's
the
blockburger
case,
five
years
for
--
not
with
a
--
in
a
pursuant
with
steins,
five
years
not
with
--
pursuant
to
a
written
order
form.
the
court
said
there,
sentencing
is
now
here
for
the
district
judge.
as
i
say,
it
--
this
seems
to
me,
i
suppose,
that
one
could
agree
on
three
different
occasions
to
take
the
bribe.
if
he
did,
according
to
the
burton
case,
that's
separate
offenses.
now,
there
was
a
choice
of
doctrine
and
as
i
say
the
states
were
not
divided
on
this
--
were
not
agreed
on
this
question
at
the
time
these
decisions
of
the
court.
but
the
court
from
1930
to
1946
was
very
consistent.
