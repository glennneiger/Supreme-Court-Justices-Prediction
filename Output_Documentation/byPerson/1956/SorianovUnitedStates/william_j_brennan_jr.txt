was
this

processed
and
not
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,

found
by
whom
to
be
without
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
you
suggested
there
was
still
a
balance.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
i
gather
this
claim
could
not
again
be
processed
as
a
payment
under
that
fund?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
know
what
that
basis
is
for?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask,
mr.
fisher
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
i
gather
it's
not
part
of
the
government's
position
that
this
was,
this
arrangement
between
the
two
governments,
the
exclusive
method
which
must
be
processed
to
recover
on
a
claim
of
this
kind?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
is
your
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
let's
see,
mr.
fisher.
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt
you,
but
i
don't
follow
this
too
well.
is
there
a
distinction
here
as
to
--
of
course
to
this
special
fund
based
upon
whether
the
purchases
were
made
for
an
american
army
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
or
for
a
filipino
army?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
if
the
purchase
was
made
either
as
a
purchase
for
the
--
an
authorized
purchase
for
the
american
army
or
for
the
filipino
army,
in
both
instances
recourses
to
this
fund?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words
that
that
--
the
reason
we
have
an
issue
here
whether
this
expense
was
made
for
the
american
army
is
that
if
it
was
for
the
american
army,
resort
to
the
court
of
claims
procedure
is
proper
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
but
if
it
was
not
made
for
the
american
army,
whether
or
not
it
was
made
for
the
filipino
army,
the
only
resort
would
have
to
be
to
the
fund
that
you
mentioned?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
the
foreigners,
do
we
have
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
anything
like
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
never
--
we
never
said
anything
that
we'd
indicate
--
we
were
calling
the
troops
of
those
nations
into
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right,
into
the
service
of
the
united
states.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
gather
your
answer
to
my
question
is
no.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
call
them
into
service
but
--
into
the
service
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
service
of
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states
that's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
really
trying
to
get
at,
mr.
fisher,
whether
necessarily
a
determination
favorably
to
the
petitioner
on
the
merits
here
is
going
to
have
any
outreaches
into
other
arrangements
that
we
may
have
made,
nato
or
otherwise.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
your
argument
must
mean
this
that
we
had
not
appropriated
this
$269
million
and
paid
out
$250
million
now
that
we
have.
there's
been
no
obligation
of
the
united
states
at
all
to
meet
any
of
these
commands.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
you
say
they
could
not
have
come
to
the
court
of
claims.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
where
else
could
they
have
come?
