justice
john
m.
harlan
did
the
court
of
claims
deals
with
those
three
cases
in
maritima?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
was
majority.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
i
gather
that
the
dissent
position
was
that
the
majority
view
is
irreconcilable
with
those?
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
this
claim
made
to
the
philippine
authority?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
it
was
turned
down
by
united
states
authority.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
we
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
control
the
fund.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question
before
you
sit
down?
do
any
of
these
papers
contain
the
proceedings
or
any
of
the
papers
related
to
the
claim
that
was
made
before
the
army?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
one
that
the
--
the
proceeding
as
it
--
you
referred
to
earlier.
you
said
this
claim
was
presented
originally
to
the
army
or
to
the
branch
of
the
army
that's
concerned
with
those
matters.
justice
john
m.
harlan
nothing
in
--
i
couldn't
find
anything
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
there
be
any
objection
to
those
being
submitted
to
the
court?
i'd
like
to
see
them.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
prefer
to
see
them.[laughter]
