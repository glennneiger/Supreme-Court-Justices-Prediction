mr.
george
w.
foley
oh,
your
honor,
i'm
--
i'm
mr.
foley.
mr.
george
w.
foley
(voice
overlap)
also
on
behalf
of
petitioner
to
argue
as
mr.
savoy
pointed
out
the
question
of
the
statute
of
limitations
which
this
court
has
permitted
us
to
brief
and
argue
after
the
decision
of
the
court
of
claims
in
the
maritima
case
about
a
month
ago,
just
before
this
case
was
due
to
be
argued
then.
the
statute
of
limitations
that's
involved
in
the
court
of
claims
is
relatively
simple.
we
set
it
out
on
--
on
page
2
of
our
brief.
in
a
fact,
it's
in
two
parts.
it
says,
first
of
all,
a
limiting
provision
and
it
says
that
every
claim
of
which
the
court
of
claims
has
jurisdiction
shall
be
barred
unless
the
petition
thereon
is
filed
within
six
years
after
the
claim
first
accrues.
mr.
george
w.
foley
that's
printed
at
page
2
mr.
justice
black
on
our
brief
on
the
statute
of
limitations
part
two.
it's
also
printed
in
the
government's
--
mr.
george
w.
foley
not
that
one,
it's
the
white
one
your
honor.
it
says
brief
for
petitioner
part
two,
statute
of
limitations.
now,
as
you
will
see
the
first
clause
which
i
have
just
paraphrased
is
the
limiting
clause
of
the
statute,
and
there
follows
a
second
clause
which
is
the
savings
clause
or
the
clause
that
adds
a
period
of
grace
to
the
statute.
that
clause
says
that
a
petition
on
the
claim
of
a
person
under
a
legal
disability
or
beyond
the
seize,
at
the
time
the
claim
accrues
may
be
filed
within
three
years
after
the
disability
seizes.
now,
about
four
years
ago
in
the
marcos
case,
marcos
against
the
united
states.
the
court
of
claims
by
a
four-to-one
decision
held
that
the
limiting
clause
of
this
statute
was
suspended
when
the
japanese
occupied
the
philippine
islands
and
it
remained
suspended
until
the
formal
surrender
of
japan
on
september
2,
1945.
therefore,
under
the
marcos
decision,
the
filipino
claimants,
in
our
position,
whose
causes
of
action
arose
during
the
war,
have
six
years
thereafter
within
which
to
commence
a
suit.
now,
except
for
the
accrual
point
which
mr.
savoy
has
mentioned,
our
facts
are
just
the
same
as
the
maritima
case
which
came
up
just
shortly.
our
petition
was
filed
more
than
three
years,
but
less
than
six
years
after
september
2nd,
1945,
after
the
formal
surrender
of
japan.
now,
in
maritima,
by
a
three-to-two
decision,
the
court
of
claims
reversed
their
position
that
may
have
taken
in
the
marcos
case.
and
they
now
hold
that
the
limiting
clause
of
the
statute,
the
first
clause
that
i
mentioned,
is
suspended
by
war
only
as
to
citizens
of
belligerence,
but
is
not
suspended
as
to
citizens
and
residence
of
the
philippine,
even
though
the
philippines
were
completely
occupied
by
the
japanese
and
under
the
domination
and
control
of
the
japanese.
now,
the
court
of
claims
reached
this
anomalous
result
after
reviewing
this
court's
holding
in
several
cases
involving
statutes
of
limitations
in
the
civil
war.
those
cases
the
court
of
claims
felt
were
based
on
prohibitions
of
international
law
against
trade
and
communication
with
citizens
of
belligerence.
the
court
of
claims
didn't
feel
that
under
international
law,
there
was
the
same
prohibition
against
trade
and
communication
with
citizens
and
residence
of
enemy
occupied
territory.
and
so
they
said
hanger
against
abbott,
the
key
case
of
this
court
and
the
other
cases
following
does
not
apply
and
the
limiting
section
of
this
statute
is
not
suspended.
true,
the
court
of
claims
said,
people
here
in
the
united
states
were
prohibited
from
dealing
with
people
in
the
philippines
but
that
was
only
because
of
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
and
that's
a
local
statute
and
it
doesn't
give
rise
to
any
rights
under
this
court's
decision
in
the
hanger
against
abbott
but
merely
puts
them
under
a
disability
by
infancy
or
incompetency
and
the
court
said,
they
then
come
within
the
saving
clause
of
the
statute,
the
second
clause
of
the
statute
and
may
have
the
protection
of
the
three-year
provision
of
that
clause.
of
course,
the
company,
maritima,
and
in
our
case
here
that
observation
of
the
court
of
claims
about
coming
under
the
saving
clause
gives
us
very
small
conferences.
these
were
filed
more
than
three
years
after
that
date.
now,
i've
mentioned
that
in
my
opinion,
the
decision
of
the
court
of
claims
in
maritima
--
maritima
isn't
reached
as
an
anomalous
result.
now,
i
think
it'd
be
clear
from
just
two
examples,
under
that
decision
of
the
court
of
claims
in
maritima,
a
citizen
of
japan
who
fought
against
us
in
the
philippine
jungles
and
who
had
a
claim
against
the
united
states
has
the
benefit
of
the
war
time
suspension
of
the
limiting
clause
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
and
his
suit
filed
within
six
years
after
the
war
ends
prevails
whereas
our
friend
in
the
philippines
who
he
overran
are
out
of
court
after
three
years.
now,
one
other
illustration
of
where
this
decision
of
the
court
of
claims
reaches
an
unjust
result.
this
decision
also
means
that
our
friends
in
enemy
occupied
territory,
if
they
had
a
cause
of
action
which
arose
one
day
before
the
occupation
started,
lose
their
rights
completely
because
it's
always
been
held
if
the
occupation
last
more
than
six
years.
because
it's
always
been
held
that
a
disability
which
arises
after
the
cause
of
action
accrues
doesn't
stop
the
running
of
the
statute
and
doesn't
come
within
this
saving
clause
of
the
court
of
claims
statute.
now,
a
citizen
of
japan
in
the
same
situation
would
have
six
years
within
which
to
bring
his
action
unless
of
course
anytime
that
had
expired
before
the
war.
now,
this
decision
of
the
court
of
claims
in
the
maritima
case
is
contrary
to
three
circuit
court
decisions
in
world
war
ii.
it's
contrary
to
a
decision
on
the
tenth
circuit,
the
turturro
case
which
we
cite
where
the
plaintiff
was
a
citizen
and
a
resident
of
france,
and
her
cause
of
action
arose
before
united
states
ended
the
war.
now,
despite
the
fact
that
she
was
not
a
citizen
of
belligerence,
the
tenth
circuit
held
that
the
limiting
clause
of
the
statute
was
suspended
during
the
time
france
was
occupied
by
the
germans
and
people
here
were
forbidden
from
trading
and
communicating
with
her
by
virtue
of
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act.
the
same
thing
in
the
district
--
in
the
circuit
court
for
the
district
of
columbia,
there,
we
had
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
residing
in
italy
doing
world
war
ii.
he
made
a
motion
to
revive
and
extend
the
money
judgment
which
he
had
gotten
in
the
district
of
columbia.
this
motion
was
denied
because
the
district
court
of
--
the
district
of
columbia
said
that
district
of
columbia
statute
contain
no
exception
in
regard
to
a
limitation,
in
regard
to
the
limitation
period.
the
circuit
court
held
that
it
was
suspended
by
implication
during
the
period
of
trade
and
communication
were
prohibited,
during
the
period
of
time
that
the
court
was
closed
to
this
man.
the
name
of
that
case
your
honor
is
salvoni
v.
pilson,
i
believe,
s-a-l-v-o-n-i.
and
in
the
second
circuit
with
a
decision
by
judge
frank
and
the
two
hands,
we
have
the
osbourne
case
where
we
have
an
american
citizen
who
was
intern
by
the
japanese.he
sued
the
united
states
under
the
suit
in
admiralty
act
and
under
the
jones
act.
and
the
second
circuit
held
that
although
neither
one
of
those
statutes
contain
any
provision
regarding
their
suspension
by
war
that
despite
that
fact,
they
were
suspended
because
our
courts
were
close
to
this
plaintiff.
mr.
george
w.
foley
that
case,
your
honor,
is
the
osborne
case,
osborne
against
the
united
states,
o-s-b-o-u-r-n-e.
mr.
george
w.
foley
in
the
maritima
case,
your
honor,
the
dissent
did
--
mr.
george
w.
foley
the
--
the
majority
as
i
recall
it
didn't
speak
of
them.
mr.
george
w.
foley
that's
right
your
honor,
that's
was
exactly
the
dissent
position.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
majority
view
is
irreconcilable
with
the
decisions
of
this
court,
with
the
decisions
of
this
court
starting
back
at
the
civil
war,
hanger
against
abbott
which
was
a
northern
plaintiff
against
the
southern
defendant.
brown
against
hyatt
which
was
case
of
a
southern
defendant
against
a
northern
plaintiff.
and
united
states
against
wiley
which
was
case
of
the
--
united
states
against
a
--
i
believe
it
was
a
southern
defendant.
now
in
each
of
those
cases
and
in
the
other
cases
we
cite
following
this
court
in
those
cases,
this
court
have
before
statutes
of
limitations
that
contains
no
--
no
limiting
clause
in
regard
to
war.
and
in
each
case,
they
held
that
that
statute
of
limitation
was
suspended
because
of
the
civil
war.
now,
true,
they
said
it
was
suspended
because
of
principles
of
international
law
closing
our
courts.
but
actually,
this
court
that
the
underlying
fact
was
not
that
international
law
was
involved,
that
wasn't
the
thing
that
led
this
court
to
its
conclusion,
but
the
fact
that
trade
and
communication
were
forbidden
and
the
courts
were
closed.
now
this
court
said,
i
am
just
paraphrasing
some
of
those
decisions,
those
decisions,
they
said
that,
statutes
of
limitations
are
enacted
with
the
underlying
presumption
that
the
courts
are
open
and
that
if
they
are
open,
a
plaintiff
with
the
a
good
cause
of
action
is
not
going
to
unduly
delay
bringing
his
suite.
now
they
say,
this
court
has
said,
where
a
superior
power
closes
the
courts
to
him,
he
is
deprived
a
proportion
of
time
which
the
legislature
contemplated
that
he
should
have.
and
therefore,
they
say
the
statute
is
suspended.
now,
the
same
reasoning
is
applicable
as
far
as
i
can
see,
whether
the
courts
are
closed
by
international
law
or
by
local
law
to
this
particular
plaintiff
such
as
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act.
in
fact
i
would
say,
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
is
--
is
merely
a
declaration
of
what
the
international
law
would
hold
under
these
circumstances.
i
would
certainly
say
that
that
international
law
would
say
that
it's
inconsistent
with
the
state
of
war
for
residence
of
enemy
occupied
territory
to
communicate
with
other
belligerence,
even
though
they
were
friendly
to
them.
it
means
there
is
the
same
danger
of
communication
of
information
of
political
and
military
value,
there
is
the
same
effective
commercial
transaction
on
the
resources
of
the
other
enemy,
as
there
is
one
citizen
of
belligerence
are
involved,
i
can't
see
any
distinction
between
a
talk.
now,
the
government
apparently
recognizes
the
illogic
of
the
court
of
claims
position
because
they
don't
go
on
the
same
ground
in
their
brief
as
the
court
of
claims
do.
they
don't
try
to
support
the
court
of
claims
holding,
they
take
a
much
broader
position.
and
they
say
that
the
statutes
of
--
the
statute
of
limitation
here
involved
is
a
consent
statute,
that's
the
magic
word
that
runs
through
their
brief,
a
consent
statute.
and
it
must
be
strictly
construed
and
that
unless
in
a
consent
statute,
the
exception
for
war
is
specified,
you
cannot
read
one
in
or
imply
one.
now,
there
is
no
reason
to
construe
a
consent
statute
differently
from
an
ordinary
statute
of
limitations
or
a
statute
of
limitations
that
create
and
limits
new
rights.
this
court
has
always
read
the
limitation
in,
in
cases
where
--
in
the
cases
where
the
trade
and
communication
was
forbidden
and
those
--
when
those
--
when
that
fact
situation
came
for
--
came
before
this
court
has
read
this
--
limits
this
suspension
into
the
statute
and
into
the
limiting
clause
of
the
statute.
and
some
of
the
cases
of
state
statute
was
involved
in
brown
against
hyatt
and
hanger
against
abbott
in
the
u.s.
against
wiley
the
united
states
statute
was
involved
when
passed
by
congress.
now,
in
the
osbourne
case
which
is
the
second
circuit
case,
osbourne
against
the
united
states
that
i
mentioned
to
your
honors
earlier,
there,
the
second
circuit
had
before
a
consent
statute
what
the
government
would
call
a
consent
statute.
they
had
before
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
and
the
jones
act
and
they
found
no
difficulty
in
holding
that
those
acts
were
suspended
because
of
the
prohibition
against
trade
and
communication
with
the
plaintiff
because
that
prohibition
close
the
court's
to
the
plaintiff.
now,
the
government
cites
kendall
vs
united
states,
the
holding
of
this
court
as
in
support
of
this
argument
that
the
particular
statute
before
the
court
cannot
be
construed
so
as
to
import
this
suspension
because
of
war.
now,
kendall
against
the
united
states
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief
at
length
why
it
isn't
in
point
and
why
it
doesn't
hold
what
the
government
says
it
holds.
that
was
a
case
where
a
rebel
brought
suite
more
than
six
years
after
the
war
had
ended.
he
claimed
that
because
of
the
loyalty
provisions
of
the
statute,
which
required
him
to
swear
that
he
hadn't
born
arms
against
united
states,
he
was
forbidden
from
suing
and
then
this
disability
was
not
removed
until
the
presidential
proclamation
of
25
december
1868.
now,
the
answer
to
the
case
is
that
the
war
ended
six
years
before
and
that
even
before
the
end
of
the
war
kendall
could
have
taken
advantage
of
a
presidential
proclamation
of
amnesty
in
may,
1865
and
brought
his
action
in
the
court
within
the
time,
within
six
years
after
the
war.
mr.
george
w.
foley
--
comment
to
make
in
closing.
before
the
recess,
i
was
dealing
with
the
government's
argument
that
the
statute
of
limitations
of
the
court
of
claims
is
a
consent
statute
and
so
must
be
interpreted
and
construed
differently
from
other
statutes.
the
--
and
our
answer
to
that
point
is
that
there's
absolutely
no
reason
why
a
consent
statute
of
limitations
should
be
construed
any
differently
than
a
--
an
ordinary
statute
of
limitations
or
statute
that
creates
and
limits
new
rights,
and
i
pointed
to
the
osborne
case
of
the
second
circuit
which
dealt
with
a
consent
statute.
now,
this
argument
of
the
government
was
put
forward
in
a
case
in
the
supreme
court
of
oregon,
peters
against
mckay
in
1951,
and
the
court
considered
the
entire
argument
at
length
and
held
that
consent
statute
or
not,
it
was
suspended
by
war.
they
said
there
that
--
and
pointed
their
argument
there,
they
pointed
out
that
where
the
state
consents
to
be
sued
and
then
by
recognition
of
its
rules
of
international
law
and
common
law,
closes
its
courts
to
the
litigants,
they
thereby
deny
the
privilege
which
they
granted
and
that
you
must
have
some
construction
of
the
statute
that
avoids
absurdity.
and
they
felt
that
it
was
not
conceivable
that
the
same
hand
which
gave
the
right
to
sue
should
with
the
other
hand
withhold
it
while
--
and
both
be
in
operation
at
the
same
time.
the
comment
of
the
--
the
court
commented
on
the
nursery
rhyme.
they
said
that
the
law
does
not
follow
the
precedent
of
the
nursery
rhyme,
“hang
your
clothes
on
the
hickory
limb
but
don't
go
near
the
water.”
and
that's
exactly
the
same
--
the
same
situation
here.
we
can't
conceive
--
mr.
george
w.
foley
[laughs]
i
would
say
so,
mr.
justice,

that
the
state
in
consenting
to
be
sued
