i
didn't

didn't

misunderstood
your
first
name.
justice

what
does
that
mean,
without
merit?
justice
hugo

black
well,
i
mean
was
it
on
this
procedural
point
that
we
didn't
know
it,
is
this
(voice

--
justice
hugo

black
well,
why
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
why
i
--
i
don't
quite
--
may
be
that
that
has
no
relevancy
with
our
question.
but
what
do
you
say
to
the
idea
that
if
the
government
in
making
appropriation
to
go
to
the
filipino's
guerrillas,
were
they
limiting
it
by
letting
it
to
be
paid
by
the
philippine
government
after
the
government
agents
acts
on
it.
why
is
that
wholly
irrelevant
with
reference
to
whether
the
government
only
paid
or
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
only
--
only.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
government
would
have
met
it
out
of
the
fund
or
directly
to
be
met,
would
it
not?
it
thought
that
he
had
really
procured
--
they
had
really
procured
these
moneys
for
the
use
of
the
guerrillas.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
say
by
denying
it
on
the
merits.
i
understood
this
to
follow
or
maybe
i'm
wrong
that
had
this
--
had
the
government,
army
officer,
whoever
passed
it
reached
the
conclusion
that
this
was
an
honest
purchase
or
sale
for
the
guerrillas,
the
government
would
have
directed
to
be
paying,
would
have
been
paid
out
of
the
fund.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
they
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
he
is
deprived
of
recovering
from
the
government,
wholly
by
the
government's
decision
that
his
claim
is
not
right
and
--
justice
hugo

black
--
his
claim
on
the
administrative
basis
--
justice
hugo

--
his
claim
is
not
just

justice
hugo

just
assistance?

what
page
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.

i
see
it.
thank
you.
justice
hugo
l.

all
of
the
expenses,
i
believe
your
--
what
you
said,
it's
on
page
39?
justice
hugo
l.

as
i
get

as
i
get
with

i
don't
want
to
take
your
time.
as
i
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what
you
said,
you've
got
a
situation
in
which
the
government
wanted
to
pay
the
soldiers
but
didn't
want
to
do
it
directly,
would
want
to
pay
them
through
the
--
see
if
they
will
pay
to
the
philippine
government,
they
made
appropriations
for
that
purpose.
you
say
that
no
legal
liability
as
i'm
--
this
as
what
i
understand
up
today,
because
the
government
was
trying
to
save
the
independence
feeling
of
the
--
sensitive
--
sensitive
feeling
to
the
philippine
government
but
that
even
sense
of
war,
the
government
paid
every
--
authorized
a
payment
of
every
claim
of
procurement
where
it
believed
(inaudible)
justice

that's
what
i
understand
the
situation
now.
justice
hugo

(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
i
should
not
(inaudible)
justice
hugo

(voice

to
pay
--
excuse
me.
were
they
free
to
pay
unless
the
army
claim
commission
approved?
justice
hugo
l.
black
from
their
own
funds?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
out
of
this
fund?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
so
you
--
if
they
do
--
and
if
this
should
go
against
--
may
i
skip,
this
is
practical
result
that
the
government
wanted
to
pay
up
through
the
philippine
army
all
the
expenses
of
these
people
recognized
of
whatever
moral
of
whatever
obligation
it
is,
instead
of
the
claim
commission,
they
passed
on,
they've
given
up
the
hearing
on
the
merits
when
it
disapproves
that
settles
and
as
a
practical
result
would
be
--
if
this
--
you
should
lose,
they'll
get
a
trial
on
the
merits
--
in
the
court
in
addition
to
the
trial
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
on
the
merits
before
the
board?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
question
i
asked
--
may
be
i
didn't
make
it
quite
clear
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
--
the
government
wants
to
pay
it
all,
wanted
to
pay
every
meritorious
claim
for
procurement
by
the
guerillas
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
provided
an
appropriation
for
that
purpose.
turned
it
all
to
the
philippine
islands
and
your
argument
here
is
with
the
desire
to
let
them
--
it
be
paid
through
them
but
the
government
has
reserved
--
is
reserving
for
itself
the
right
to
approve
on
these
payments
that
should
be
made
out
of
their
fund
and
it
does
so
on
the
basis
of
the
board
of
army
commissioner
or
whoever
they
are
on
the
merits
and
the
only
thing
that
would
happen
here
--
i'm
not
saying
it
should
happen
or
whether
that's
a
ground
to
decide.
the
thing
that
would
happen
would
be
that
an
addition
to
the
trial
on
the
merits
before
the
commission,
they
would
get
one
for
according.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
--
that's
the
end
result.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
did
you
say
an
enemy?
