mr.
foley,
may
i
--
or
mr.
fisher,
may
i
ask
you
just
one
question.
i
hate
to
interrupt
you
but
--
but
how
did
we
treat
them
in
relation
to
such
matters
as
this
during
that
period
between
1941
and
1946?
you
said
as
to
some
matters,
we
--
we
treated
them
as
sovereign.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
how
do
--
how
did
we
treat
them
in
matters
of
this
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
we
--
did
we
assume
the
responsibility
for
the
payment
of
those
bills
and
merely
make
the
philippine
government
our
agent
or
did
we
limit
the
philippine
government
to
the
amount
of
money
that
we
appropriated
to
them
for
that
purpose?
do
they
have
the
right
to
--
to
incur
obligations
irrespective
of
appropriations?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice

just
one
--
just
one
other
question
along
those
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
lines
please,
to
what
extent
did
our
government
process
favorably
any
claims
of
american
origin,
as
you
used
that
term,
of
this
character
between
the
--
in
the
philippines,
between
the
date
of
the
surrender
in
september
1942
and
the
--
and
1945
when
the
japanese
surrendered?
did
they
process
any
of
them
favorably?
chief
justice
earl
warren
during
that
entire
period?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
talking
about
for
requisitions
that
--
that
were
issued
during
that
period
between
the
surrender
in
september
1942
and
--
and
the
surrender
of
the
japanese
in
1945,
has
our
government
paid
for
any
--
any
claims
like
this
that
occurred
during
that
period
either
through
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
philippine
government
or
--
or
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
the
only
reason
i
--
i
pursue
this
is
because
i
understood
you
to
--
to
speak
of
--
of
this
claim
as
being
one
of
american
origin
because
they
claimed
that
it
sprang
from
the
order
of
an
american
officer.
now,
were
any
claims
of
that
kind
approved
and
paid
by
our
government
during
that
period?
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
there
any
instances
where
american
officers
put
in
a
claim
of
this
kind
for
guerilla
warfare
during
that
period
that
i
spoke
of
and
were
paid?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
don't
mean
pay
but
for
requisition
to
goods.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
language
in
there
indicates
that
they
didn't
take
"control
and
responsibility"
for
the
philippine
army?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
did
--
did
they
ever
in
--
in
the
--
in
the
french
situation
try
to
incorporate
all
those
guerrilla
forces
or
underground
forces
into
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
president
did
here,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
the
president
of
the
united
states
did
here.

chief

--
july
26,
1941,
i
hereby
call
and
order
into
the
service
of
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states
for
the
period
of
the
existing
emergency,
all
of
the
organized
military
forces
of
the
government
of
the
commonwealth
of
the
philippines,
but
that
isn't
calling
them
into
our
armed
forces
and
incorporating
them
into
it,
i
don't
know
what
language
you
would
use.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know,
but
--
but
you
--
you've
got
to
face
this
as
a
condition,
do
you
not
and
not
a
theory
and
--
and
you
can't
show
by
some
other
documents
that
the
president
of
the
united
states
didn't
mean
what
he
said
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
you
don't
get
any
comfort
from
--
from
that,
would
you
read
me
what
you
do
get
comfort
from
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
militates
against
this
military
order
of
july
26,
1941.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
now,
before
you
get
to
the
act,
you
--
you're
reading
us
some
legislative
history,
is
that
all
the
legislative
history
you
rely
on?
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
you're
not

you're

colonel

overruling
the

--
commander-in-chief,
aren't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
does
that
disprove
anything
in
that
other
order?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
that
a
matter
of
accounting
--
isn't
that
only
a
matter
of
accounting
you
should
talk
about?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fisher,
just
one
other
thing,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
although
this
was
a
responsibility
of
the
philippine
government
to
be
in
no
instance
have
the
philippine
government
ever
honored
a
claim
of
this
kind
unless
it
had
first
been
passed
by
our
war
claims
commission,
is
that
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
thank
you,
mr.
fisher.
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you,
mr
--
mr.
savoy,
i
think
we'll
have
the
case
then.
