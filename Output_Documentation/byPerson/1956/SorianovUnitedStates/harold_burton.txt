mr.
fisher,
i'd
like
ask
you
just
to
--
justice
harold
burton
--
make
sure
just
that
i
understand
the
status
of
this.
if
we
would
hold
with
the
petitioner
here
and
reverse
the
court
of
claims,
it's
better
not
settling
the
matter
with
it,
it
then
has
to
go
back
to
the
court
of
claims
and
be
heard
on
the
merits
of
whether
these
claims
are
good
claims
or
not.
justice
harold
burton
mr.
fisher,
do
you
take
any
position
on
the
statute
of
limitation?
