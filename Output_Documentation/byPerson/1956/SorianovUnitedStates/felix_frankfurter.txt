justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
negative
rule
of
statutory
construction,
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
it
was
turned
down
by
the
army
not
on
the
merits,
not
substantively
but
suppose
it
was
--
this
was
not
a
proper
claim
--
a
claim
with
the
pursuit
against
the
united
states,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
it
turned
down
on
the
merits
by
the
army?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
case
that
comes
before
us,
it
doesn't
turn
on
us,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
it
would
turn
--
suppose
if
it
could
turn
down
on
the
merits,
what
reviewing
power
is
there
of
that
determination?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
a
claim
against
this
fund,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
was
wondering,
mr.
fisher,
if
this
claim
was
turned
down
on
--
by
a
non-reviewable
administrative
decision,
why
are
we
called
upon
to
enter
upon
this
more
complicated
--
in
the
relationship
between
us
and
the
philippine
affairs.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
all
his
business,
you
told
us
that's
irrelevant
to
this
problem
--
to
our
problem.
in
short,
this
is
a
claim
that
there
was
in
fact
a
taking
by
those
asking
impliedly
by
--
by
way
of
contract
for
the
united
states
and
therefore
recoverable
in
the
court
of
claims.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
all
the
rest
of
it
--
why
do
i
have
to
bother
whether
this
fund
was
restricted
or
wasn't
restricted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
it
demonstrates
it
at
all
because
what
the
two
governments
between
themselves
--
i
won't
say
that
and
they
--
suppose
he
started
the
facts
and
they
have
some
bearing
but
you
might
have
an
interrelationship
as
between
general
macarthur
and
the
president
--
but
he
then
wasn't
(inaudible)
which
doesn't
bear
on
whether
or
not
in
the
contingencies
and
emergencies
of
war,
this
was
in
effect
a
seizure
of
property
for
which
uncle
sam
could
pay
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
is
a
war
which
he
was
conducting
and
the
people
who
received
it
were
acting
for
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
fisher,
before
we
allow
you
to
merely
make
the
argument,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
so
many
question
arising
out
of
the
question
--
the
answer
you
gave
to
justice
brennan.
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
one
of
the
contention
of
the
government
is
that
even
assuming
there
is
a
claim
against
the
united
states,
show
you
one
side
of
the
question
(inaudible)
that
there
are
limitations
as
to
the
fund
or
the
procedure
by
which
--
in
law
against
the
limited
(inaudible)
did
you
say
something
like
that
or
what
did
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
couldn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
unless
--
unless
the
right
will
resort
to
the
court
of
claims,
had
been
cut
down
that
you
well
could
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
not
made
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
--
what
were
you
saying
on
that
point
you're
just
explaining?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
--
suppose
they
had
--
that
would
be
the
boundary
to
the
implied
jurisdiction
as
to
--
under
the
fifth
amendment
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
namely,
if
they
turned
you
down,
we
can
make
--
go
to
the
court
of
claims
to
say
they
turned
it
down
improperly?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
fisher,
i
haven't
read
the
brief
so
i
don't
know
--
suggestion
by
the
petitioner
that
documents
can
spell
out
this
macarthur
or
the
guerrillas
or
does
--
is
the
--
is
that
that
way
or
is
it
rather
that
the
circumstances
that
occurred
after
war
and
after
the
capitulation,
after
general
macarthur
left
that
those
events
brought
about
a
factual
situation
for
which
the
authority
must
be
implied,
which
is
it?
i'm
not
arguing,
i'm
asking.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
the
latter
that
i
don't
--
they
adopted
in
the
philippines
to
be
a
very
important
--
i
should
describe
very
much
that
there
were
documents
of
this
express
authority.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
event
won't
matter,
don't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
got
away.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
the
realm
of
contract
is
as
you
know
a
very
separate
one,
what
is
taught
and
what
an
implied
contract,
it
supports
a
case
that
was
being
showed
to
--
concerning
on
various
delicate
scenarios.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
--
if
i
don't
find
it
in
documents,
it
wouldn't
conclude
the
inquiry?
justice
felix
frankfurter
perhaps
you
would
have
to
show
more
than
that.
you
have
to
show
as
a
practical
thing
that
all
the
military
forces,
regular,
guerilla
or
whatnot
who
are
operating
aren't
operating
under
the
authority
of
the
general
testimony
of
macarthur.
isn't
that
the
real
job
you
have?
because
if
you
were
--
if
they
were
--
if
they
were
part
of
this
military
force,
then
i
don't
have
to
have
any
documents,
i
wouldn't
be
expecting
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
the
nature
of
war
would
preclude
and
the
effective
thing
is
were
they
part
of
his
army?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
loose
language
on
my
part,
but
i
should
think
that
one
would
have
to
disabuse
himself
of
--
of
stuff
of
which
he
can
take
judicial
notice.
certainly,
i
can
with
myself
but
the
merger
of
forces
in
the
philippine
was
a
very
different
thing
from
what
you
suggested,
about
the
resistance
forces
in
france.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
suggest
the
very
important
consideration
of
all
the
phrases,
the
formulas
that
were
used
during
this
period
in
part
of
the
act,
would
you
regard
the
susceptibility
of
a
nation
(inaudible)
this
is
a
statement
i'm
making
on
your
side.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
fisher
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was
talking
about
the
military
army
in
the
philippines.
may
i
suggest,
you
have
the
best
(inaudible)
of
your
time
but
at
least
for
one
member
of
the
court,
the
typical
issue,
the
problems
of
this
case
arise
after
these
documents,
that
is
after
japan
to
hold
--
and
i
hope
you
leave
yourself
enough
time,
you
haven't
got
much
time
left
to
deal
with
those
events,
it
seems
to
me
the
crucial
aspect
of
this
case.
others
may
not
take
seriously,
just
leave
yourself
enough
time
to
deal
what
happened
after
the
war
broke
out
and
after
general
macarthur
left
and
the
circumstances
under
which
he
left
and
what
was
happening
after
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
express
authority
but
authority
derivably
expressed
by
a
force
of
circumstances
and
actions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
the
patience
of
this
court
dealing
with
the
application
of
the
fifth
amendment,
you
don't
have
to
have
an
order
in
turn
that
authorized
by
the
congress
or
president
of
the
united
states,
i
hereby
seize
these
goods
for
which
uncle
sam
under
which
to
pay
or
has
to.
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
in
the
context
of
the
circumstances,
it
isn't
what
you
indicated
earlier,
an
implied
power
of
uncle
sam.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
mind
stating
with
more
particularity
than
you
have
how
--
how
your
view
on
the
decision
in
this
case
may
be
restricted
assuming
this
doesn't
affirm
entirely,
how
it
may
be
restricted
so
as
not
to
embarrass
these
other
questions
would
you
say
are
now
being
discussed
on
the
political
level?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
as
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
to
--
as
to
this
other
--
as
to
the
other
open
questions
which
are
now
in
--
in
discussion
between
the
philippines
and
ourselves,
a
decision
in
this
case
adverse
to
the
government
from
necessarily
cut
into
those
problems.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
for
seizure
as
by
way
of
eminent
domain
must
be
restricted.
that's
all
that's
involved
in
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
in
number,
how
many
claims
would
be
affected
by
decision
in
this
case
if
the
government
will
not
sustain?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all,
75?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
damage
doesn't
look
troublesome.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
a
separate
statute
tolling,
is
that
a
limitation
or
a
legislation
in
which
rights
are
given
or
immunities
conferred
if
there
is
that
qualification,
which
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
go
ahead.
