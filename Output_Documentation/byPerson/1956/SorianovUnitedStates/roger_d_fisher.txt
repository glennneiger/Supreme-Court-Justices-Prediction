mr.
roger
d.
fisher
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
at
the
outset
to
state
the
position
of
the
government
on
the
two
basic
issues
now
before
this
court
in
this
case.
i'll
then
take
up
each
issue
in
turn
in
more
detail.
the
first
issue
is
the
one
on
which
certiorari
was
granted.
the
issue
was
raised
in
the
petition
whether
members
of
the
philippine
army,
who
were
recognized
in
certain
ways,
found
in
certain
categories,
were
members
of
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states
for
procurement
purposes
so
at
requisitioning
of
supplies
could
create
debts
of
the
united
states.
it's
an
issue
of
status
and
authority,
whether
the
status
of
this
group
of
people,
the
philippine
guerrillas,
who
were
later
recognized
or
who
were
recognized
contemporaneously
was
such
that
they
have
authority
to
create
direct
obligation
upon
the
united
states
government
by
their
procurement,
their
requisitioning.
on
this
issue,
our
position
is
that
they
did
not
--
had
no
such
authority.
although,
the
philippine
government
was
not
holding
independent,
prior
to
july
4th,
1946,
they
were
a
semi-sovereign
or
quasi-sovereign,
had
some
independence.
that
was
the
position
of
united
states
from
1941
until
1946
when
the
philippines
required
full
independence
to
treat
them
with
as
much
independence
as
was
consistent
with
their
position.
the
assistant
--
financial
assistance
which
united
states
gave
to
the
philippine
army
was
handled
in
such
a
way,
it
was
handled
in
much
the
way
that
assistance
to
other
governments
was
handled
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
as
to
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
as
to
the
financial
arrangements
with
respect
to
the
army
and
the
payment
of
the
soldiers
and
their
supply,
their
procurement,
all
that
is
the
bulk
of
my
argument.
we
handled
that
through
the
philippine
government.
the
united
states
advanced
several
hundred
million
dollars
about
--
around
$300
million
to
the
philippine
government
to
be
used
to
meet
those
expenses
of
the
philippine
army
with
--
of
which
general
macarthur
approved.
he
had
a
veto
power
on
this
military
assistance
as
other
aid
missions
have
had
and
other
military
assistance.
these
funds
were
advanced
to
the
government,
put
in
the
philippine
treasury
with
the
agreement
that
they
would
be
only
used
for
those
purposes
of
the
army
of
which
we
--
we,
that
is
general
macarthur
which
the
american
army
commander,
approved
those
funds.
there
are
still
funds
in
their
--
in
the
philippine
treasury
beyond
those
required
to
meet
the
claims
which
have
been
approved
and
the
return
of
these
funds
was
the
matter
under
discussion
between
the
two
governments
right
now.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
precisely,
they
could
incur
obligations.
a
philippine
dispersing
officer,
a
filipino
officer
could
procure
without
regard
to
the
american
appropriation.
that
procurement
went
directly
against
the
philippine
treasury.
the
--
the
extent
where
those
funds
could
be
reimbursed
or
paid
directly
from
the
american
funds
that
have
been
advanced
to
the
treasury
with
the
question
for
approval
of
our
military
people
in
the
field,
where
this
military
expenditure
is
appropriate.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
right
and
there
were
no
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no
--
there
was
money
appropriated
every
year
by
congress.
during
the
war,
it
was
a
token
amount
of
$100
for
two
appropriations,
after
that
went
back
up
to
$269
million
or
whatever,
$100
million
dollars
more.
the
--
the
funds
were
--
during
the
pre-period,
from
july
of
1941
until
the
surrender
in
1942,
all
procurement
matters
were
handled
as
i've
just
outlined.
as
soon
as
any
bills
were
met
by
any
one
after
the
reoccupation
in
1944,
the
landings
at
leyte
and
the
recognition
of
the
guerrillas,
the
meeting
of
those
claims,
both
governments
recognized
that
all
those
claims
were
handled
in
the
same
manner.
the
--
the
thousands
of
guerrillas
who
were
recognized
and
given
back
pay
were
paid
by
the
philippine
government
through
--
by
philippine
dispersing
officers.
the
question
here
is
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
one
of
procedure
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
yes,
there
were
some
400,000
claims
for
requisitioning
against
the
philippine
government
which
were
screened
for
approval
by
the
army
claim
service
which
was
screening
this
for
approval,
and
i
do
not
have
the
figure
of
how
many
were
recognized
that
there
were
broad
categories
of
them
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
that
were
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
and
they
were
paid.
there
remains
about
$30
million
in
this
fund
to
meet
such
claims
as
on
further
study
or
further
investigation
should
be
paid.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
this
claim
was
processed
and
found
to
be
without
merit.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
found
by
the
army
claims
service,
it
was
reviewed
in
the
army
claims
service,
their
reconsideration
and
was
found
that
there
was
no
merit
in
the
claim.
our
position
is
that
one
of
procedure
that
the
--
if
he
has
a
claim
that
is
not
against
the
united
states
but
against
the
philippine
government.
their
--
united
states
has
been
generous
to
advance
fund
to
meet
all
legitimate
claims.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
there
is
about
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
$30
million,
roughly
speaking
$25
million
to
$30
million
in
the
philippine
treasury
recognized
to
have
been
advanced
by
the
united
states
for
these
purposes
which
has
not
been
dispersed.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
i
believe
it
could
not.
i
believe
it
that
if
it
were
processed,
it
will
be
turned
down
on
the
same
basis
it
was
turned
down
before.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
official
reason
was
without
merit.
the
record
shows
that
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
it
might
mean
any
of
a
number
of
things,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no.
no,
this
--
this
claim
was
applied
for
against
the
funds
in
the
philippine
treasury.
it
was
turned
down
as
being
either
not
a
requisition,
it
was
in
fact
made
that
the
receipts
were
--
i
noticed
in
the
record,
it
shows
that
one
of
the
affirmative
defenses
of
the
government
below
is
fraud,
that
the
receipts
were
fraudulent.
it
is
a
matter
of
public
record
that
the
--
i
wouldn't
say
the
bulk,
but
i
would
say
that
there
were
hundreds
of
thousands
of
fraudulent
claims
filed
at
that
time
screened
by
in
detail.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
this
claim
was
under
the
procedure,
it
was
a
claim
against
the
funds
advanced
to
the
philippine
government.
the
claim
was
made,
they
applied
to
the
army
claims
service
since
the
toughest
hurdle
in
such
claims
was
to
get
the
u.s.
army
to
approve
that
this
was
a
type
of
military
expenditure
of
the
philippine
army
for
which
congress
wanted
funds
to
be
spent.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
we
disapproved
the
claim
and
said
it
--
you
should
not
meet
this
from
the
funds
which
we
have
advanced.
the
philippine
government
treasury
is
tight
and
they
have
adopted
the
rule,
if
they
will
not
pay
anything
that
the
united
states
army
says
was
not
a
proper
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
claim.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
we
control
the
funds
that
were
advanced.
we
have
a
right
of
approval
or
disapproval
over
the
use
of
those
funds
as
with
our
military
systems
program
to
other
countries
where
they
--
where
you
give
them
a
program,
an
alloted
sum
of
money
and
we
consider
which
projects
we
will
approve
the
use
of
our
funds
for.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
i'm
--
i'm
afraid
i've
made
--
failed
to
make
that
clear.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
it
was
turned
down
on
the
merits
by
the
army.
now,
the
merits
may
have
been,
it
was
fraudulent.
the
merits
may
have
been,
the
supplies
were
not
necessities.
the
merits
may
have
been
that
this
$80,000
worth
of
rice,
that
two
pfcs
and
sergeants
and
officers
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
the
--
the
merits
are
not
here
involved.
the
question
here
involved
is
whether
the
members
of
the
philippine
army,
as
a
class,
had
implied
authority
to
create
direct
obligations
against
the
united
states.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no
judicial
reviewing
power
in
this
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
by
against
this
fund.
there
would
--
there
would
be
a
reviewing
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
because
of
petitioner's
contention,
your
honor,
that
this
was
a
taking
by
officers
of
the
united
states,
that
this
was
a
fifth
amendment
taking
that
the
army
cannot
interpose
its
own
review
and
he
is
claiming,
i
might
say,
against
funds
in
the
treasury
here.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
his
contention.
it
is
--
i
believe
that
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
you
--
you
need
not
bother
that
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
with
that
except
that
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
that
indicates
the
manner
in
which
the
two
governments,
for
15
years,
have
considered
their
relations
and
the
financial
aid
from
one
government
to
the
military
forces
of
the
other.
this
demonstrates
the
procedure
which
the
two
governments
have
adopted
for
meeting
this
moral
obligation
to
meet
all
or
part
of
the
cost.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
my
remarks
go
to
the
--
your
--
your
last
phrase
and
that
the
people
who
did
it
and
received
the
rice
were
acting
for
him.
it
is
the
--
our
contention
that
they
were
members
of
the
philippine
army
acting
for
the
philippine
government
under
arrangement
between
the
two
governments,
and
i
like
if
i
might
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
if
this
appropriation
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
if
the
appropriation
were
made
after
these
particular
filipino
soldiers
had
already
become
agents
of
the
united
states
or
officers
of
the
united
states,
we
might
be
held
liable
on
a
taking
by
the
united
states
whether
or
not
other
arrangements
were
made
--
committed.
the
united
states
cannot
meet
--
i
might
now
arguing
petitioner's
contention,
you
cannot
meet
an
obligation,
say,
constitutional
obligation
by
--
to
--
for
a
constitutional
taking
by
appropriating
limited
funds
for
limited
purpose.
we
must
first
meet
the
question
of
whether
this
broad
group
of
philippine
guerrillas,
members
of
the
philippine
army
had,
from
their
status,
authority
to
obligate
the
united
states
on
procurement
matters.
now
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
yes,
sir.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
it
is
our
position.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
it
is
our
position
that
the
only
arrangement
--
the
only
recovery
against
the
united
states
would
be
against
such
--
against
the
united
states
would
be
against
such
funds
that
the
united
states
had
advanced
for
that
purpose
and
left
the
military
discretion
to
approve.
now,
the
only
recovery,
the
philippine
government
as
it
was
a
--
and
is
now
a
wholly
independent
government,
petitioner
may
well
have
a
cause
of
action
against
the
philippine
government
which
he
can
process
in
their
court,
he
can
in
the
court
of
claims
and
recover
whether
or
not
united
states
has
agreed
to
meet
this
particular
expense
with
a
fund.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
didn't
get
the
subject
to
your
question.
did
you
say
who
would
have
approved?
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
correct,
$250
million
worth
of
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
of
funds
were
advanced
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
right.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
he
--
he
is
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
he
is
deprived
of
his
recovery
against
the
united
states
wholly
on
that
ground.
it
is
the
first
step
in
our
argument
that
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
expenditures
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
right.
the
financial
arrangement
between
the
two
and
i'd
like
to
reply
--
i
might
turn
to
the
--
the
critical
stage.
first,
it's
--
it's
not
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
yes,
sir.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
right,
whether
the
--
the
merits
would
again
be
tried.
i
take
it
the
issue
there,
if
you
should
reverse,
would
be
a
conclusion
of
this
court
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
you
could
not
say
that
this
army
did
not
have
that
authority.
and
that
the
question
was
one
of
fact
to
be
tried
out
as
to
whether
these
particular
guerrillas
received
particular
cables
from
macarthur
to
say
they
could
go
ahead
and
take
these
supplies.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
what
--
we
would
say
that
if
there
is
a
claim,
a
constitutional
claim
for
taking
because
of
a
taking
by
authorized
officers
of
the
united
states
that
we
could
not
limit
the
recovery
to
discretion
of
the
military
officers.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
we
could
not.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
it
could
be.
we
--
we
have
not
made
that
contention.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
we
have
not
made
that
contention
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
was
saying
that
the
only
way
in
which,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
under
our
view,
petitioner
could
recover
funds
that
had
an
american
origin
would
have
been
by
getting
approval
of
the
army
claims
service
for
disbursement
from
the
funds
advanced
to
the
philippine
government.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
we
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
we
have
not
made
the
contention
that
the
appropriation
act
in
the
various
orders
--
legislation
dealing
with
the
appropriation
limited
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
claims
in
this
area.
well,
our
basic
contention
is
that
the
--
we
start
from
the
agreed
premise
that
the
philippine
army
in
1941
had
no
authority
to
obligate
the
united
states.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
no.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
no,
no.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
no,
the
fund
was
to
be
used
for
the
expense
of
the
philippine
army.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
right.
it
is
our
basic
view
that
they
have
no
cause
of
action
against
the
united
states
for
this
taking.
this
was
a
taking
by
one
--
picture
the
scene
on
the
island
of
negros,
one
filipino
who
was
resisting
the
japanese
agrees
with
another
filipino
who
has
been
raising
rice
and
said,
“i
will
take
the
rice
for
our
group
here,"
and
someone
--
and
now
on
the
pleadings
we
say
they
agree
that
the
united
states
army
will
pay
for
this
rice
after
the
--
the
war.
we
say
that
--
that
whether
this
--
that
there
was
no
authority
to
this
group
being
philippine
members
of
the
philippine
army
as
such.
they
got
neither
no
authority
to
do
--
to
bind
the
united
states
and
that
whether
we
met
that's
--
that's
our
contention
and
that
whether
they
--
whether
the
authority
was
--
was
there
or
not
depends
upon
what
the
act
between
the
two
governments
were
and
whether
this
particular
expense
should
be
paid
for
as
an
expense
of
the
philippine
army
is
a
matter
for
military
discretion
from
funds
appropriate
for
military
assistance.
i
would
like
to
start
from
page
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
not
at
all.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
during
the
period
of
the
japanese
occupation,
there
was
no
army
claim
service
functioning
and
there
was
no
processing
of
any
claims
arising
at
that
time
at
all.
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
during
the
entire
period.
if
i
understand
correctly,
the
army
claims
service
set
up
to
approve
expenditures
from
this
fund
for
guerilla
claims
was
given
that
authority
in
august
of
1945.
they
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
right,
that
--
that
there's
no
doubt
about
that
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
oh
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
--
i
did
misunderstand
your
question.
following
their
return,
the
united
states
army
claims
service
has
approved
claims
of
the
philippine
army
for
military
expenditures,
the
bulk
of
which
were
guerilla
--
of
necessity,
guerilla
claims.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
order
of
$250
million
worth
have
been
met
by
the
united
states,
$285
million
were
the
funds
that
were
advanced
to
the
philippine
government.
there
are
about
30
or
25
to
30
million
left
and
some
250
were
used
to
meet
all
types
of
claims
of
the
philippine
army
and
of
suppliers
to
the
philippine
guerilla.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
contention
made
here
is
that
the
philippine
guerrillas,
officers
of
the
philippine
army
were,
by
that
fact,
american
officers
and
their
type
requisitioning
should
be
honored.
without
--
the
court
of
claims
--
the
--
the
army
claims
service
did
not
have
to
decide
whether
a
philippine
officer
was
an
officer
of
the
united
states.
he
said
if
he
was
an
officer
of
the
philippine
army
and
he
requisitions
supply
to
help
their
army,
we
will
meet
those
claims
from
the
funds
which
the
congress
has
appropriated
and
the
united
states
has
made
available
to
philippine
government
and
we
did.
we
have
met
literally
thousands
of
claims
of
this
type
but
requisitions
by
members
of
guerilla
forces
who
are
allegedly
members
of
the
philippine
army.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
the
philippine
government
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
philippine
government
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
right.
we
approved
the
meeting
of
--
of
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
such
claims
with
funds
which
the
united
states
had
advanced
for
that
purpose.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
assume
there
were
that
they
--
that
officers
know.
i
think
the
order
showed
that
the
--
anyone
who
claimed
as
an
american
officer,
his
back
pay
for
example,
who
was
an
escapee
or
pow
that
he
was
paid
from
a
different
appropriation.
he
was
paid
from
the
military
appropriations,
not
from
the
expense
of
the
philippine
army.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
his
supplies
would
have
been
an
expense
of
the
philippine
army
since
the
whole
guerilla
activities
were
as
philippine
army
expenses.
i
would
like
to
start
the
--
and
focus
the
question
if
i
might
as
to
where
petitioner
contend
the
philippine
army
got
this
authority,
this
general
authority
and
deal
with
the
legislation
involved.
he
states
--
petitioner
states
on
--
it's
in
the
yellow
brief,
reply
brief
on
page
23.
the
philippine
army
was
originally
unquestionably
a
separate
army.
many
said
at
that
time,
1934
to
1941,
it
is
true
that
the
philippine
army
had
no
authority
to
bind
the
united
states.
that's
the
agreed
ground
from
which
we
start.
petitioner
concedes
the
philippine
government
and
its
army
was
sufficiently
separate
from
the
united
states
that
prior
to
the
act
--
the
events
of
1941,
it
had
no
authority
to
bind
the
united
states
on
any
requisition.
then
he
goes
on
in
the
middle
of
page
23,
after
the
induction
of
the
philippine
army
in
1941,
the
philippine
army
and
its
officers
under
the
emergency
conditions
in
the
war
against
japan
had
just
as
much
authority
to
bind
the
united
states
as
had
any
other
american
officer
who
was
or
was
not
part
of
the
united
states
army
as
defined
by
congress.
he
is
relying
here
on
the
induction
of
1941
when
the
president
ordered
the
military
forces
of
the
philippines
into
the
service
of
the
armed
forces
of
united
states.
as
conferring
that
authority,
i'd
--
i'd
like
to
deal
with
the
--
the
three
key
orders
and
--
one
statute
and
two
executive
orders
involved
in
their
legislative
history
showing
what
were
the
intent
at
the
time.
did
the
united
states
intend
to
confer
authority?
we
also
start,
i
might
say
parenthetically
from
the
agreed
premise
that
there
is
no
authority
unless
it's
been
conferred
expressly
or
impliedly.
and
indeed,
there
would
be
authority
as
to
be
transferred
at
this
time
by
these
events
from
the
united
states
government
to
the
philippine
army.
the
--
he
refers
to
the
executive
order
of
july
26,
1941.
this
is
the
order
which
we
interpreted
one
or
we're
interpreting,
it's
on
--
from
the
blue
--
from
the
petition
for
the
writ
on
page
10a
and
this
is
president
roosevelt
in
july
26,
1941
under
authority
which
he
had
under
the
constitution
of
the
philippines
and
the
independence
act,
"i
hereby
call
an
order
into
the
service
of
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states
for
the
period
of
existing
emergency
and
placed
under
the
command
of
a
general
officer,
united
states
army,"
skipping
down,
"all
of
the
organized
military
forces
of
the
government
of
the
commonwealth
of
the
philippines."
this
order
was
to
take
effect
from
dates
now
specified
by
general
officer
named
by
the
secretary
of
war.
now,
this
--
this
order
was
issued
and
derived
following
a
war
department
memorandum
recommending
this
procedure,
this
memorandum
in
turn
was
based
on
the
recommendations
of
general
garner
who
was
out
in
the
philippines
and
general
macarthur.

in

independence

mr.

fisher
i'm
in
my
head.
the
independence
act
of
1934
spurs
authority

the
president
to
call
up
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
it's
--
it
is
--
it
is
in
here.
we
applied
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
it's
--
it's
clear
that
the
--
this
--
this
language
we
take
from
the
executive
order
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
philippine
government
was
--
the
philippines
islands
were
made
independent
in
two
stages.
in
1935
under
an
act
of
1934
was
the
first
stage.
ten
years
later,
give
or
take,
few
months
in
july
4th,
1946,
full
independence
was
obtained.
during
this
interim
period
between
1935
and
1946,
the
united
states
reserved
this
authority
to
call
up
the
organized
military
forces
into
the
service
of
whatever
armed
forces
the
united
states
happened
to
have
in
the
philippines.
now,
we
couldn't
just
call
up
the
philippine
infantry
or
individual
civilian.
we
couldn't
call
up
the
philippine
army
into
the
service
of
an
army
we
had
in
europe.
we
can
only
call
them
into
the
service
of
the
organized
military
forces
which
the
united
states
had
in
the
philippines.
it
was
--
it's
an
in
between
situation.
if
we
were
defending
the
philippines,
we
should
have
some
authority
to
command
their
organized
forces.
we
had
responsibilities
at
that
time.
the
--
in
considering
what
they
intended
to
do
by
this
order,
i'd
like
to
look
to
the
war
department
memorandum
quoted
on
pages
81
to
84,
in
fact,
in
appendix
of
our
brief,
the
basic
brief
of
the
united
states
on
this
issue.
on
page
82,
the
memorandum
recites
the
conditions
and
this
was
the
one
approved
by
the
secretary
of
war
which
went
to
the
president
when
he
signed
that
executive
order.
they
quote
general
mcarthur's
view.
general
mcarthur
states,
"the
importance
of
having
the
philippine
army
retained
its
complete
identity
and
operation
under
its
own
laws
and
regulations."
in
paragraph
4,
skipping
over
to
paragraph
8,
"any
funds
secured
should
be
available
to
meet
pertinent
expenses
of
the
philippine
commonwealth."
we
believe
this
indicates
that
there
was
at
least
some
doubts
as
to
what
--
they
were
not
planning
to
put
the
army
under
--
merge
it
into
the
american
army
and
give
all
filipino
soldiers
the
emergency
powers
which
an
american
officer
might
have.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
we
certainly
intended
to
have
military
command
and
we
had
it.
the
language
i'm
looking
at
here
is
that
the
philippine
army
shall
retain
its
complete
identity
reading
on
an
operation
under
its
own
laws
and
regulations.
if
philippines'
officers
were
to
procure
under
their
own
laws
and
regulations,
we
submit
that
they
were
not
to
create
obligations
on
the
united
states
thereby.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
they
do
not
rely
on
any
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
they
--
they
do
not
rely
on
express
authority.
they
do
rely
on
the
acts
of
1941
as
changing
the
status
of
the
philippine
army,
these
documents,
these
laws
and
regulations
and
executive
orders
and
they
rely
on
the
fact,
they
--
they
keep
referring
to
the
word
“in”,
they
were
--
they
were
to
be
called
“in
the
service
of
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states”
and
not
“with”
and
this
--
thereby
they're
trying
to
construe
these
documents
as
indicating
that
the
philippine
army
following
these
events
had
implied
authority
to
obligate
the
united
states
on
its
supply.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
if
this
were
a
tort
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
if
this
were
a
tort
action
in
which
the
control
of
an
instrumentality
had
done
some
harm,
if
we're
being
sued
for
depredations
by
--
committed
by
guerrillas
under
the
command
of
macarthur
and
there's
a
question
of
whether
it
was
justified
by
the
war
or
not.
i
would
think
we
would
not
--
we
could
not
defend
on
the
grounds
i'm
suggesting
here.
these
are
constitutional
--
these
are
takings
by
authorized
officers,
their
contracts
entered
into,
receipt
is
given,
i'll
pay
you
such
and
such
a
price
for
this
rice.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
well,
the
--
the
problem
of
who
is
an
authorized
officer
of
the
united
states
is
not
merely
a
theoretical
one
for
interesting
discussion,
it
is
a
very
practical
one
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
in
a
world
which
the
american
army
today
is
cooperating
in
joint
military
ventures
in
nato.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
it
would
not.
i
would
like
to
show
the
documents
that
it
was
so
clear
that
the
events
are
--
could
not
show
otherwise.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
if
i
may
answer
your
question
with
another
question.
i
believe
--
indicating
i
disagree
with
your
conclusion
that
if
they
were
part
of
his
army,
we
would
be
obligated.
general
eisenhower
had
forces
in
his
command
on
the
landings
in
france.we
communicated
with
the
french
underground.
we
urged
them
to
resist
and
to
fight.
it
is
not
enough
to
show
that
there
were
military
commands
and
authority
running
to
it.
the
detail
of
the
arrangements
that
have
been
made
between
governments
here
that
if
--
between
this
quasi
independent
government
and
then
a
fully
independent
government,
these
arrangements
have
been
respected
for
15
years
and
assumed
to
be
that
way,
over
a
million
claimants
have
been
satisfied
with
this
procedure,
some
35
have
suggested
they
have
direct
suits
against
the
united
states
and
a
filed
suit
in
the
court
of
claims.
the
--
it
is
simply
on
the
theory
you
suggested
that
they're
part
of
the
military
or
army
of
macarthur,
the
united
states
must
be
responsible
for
everything
that
happened.
in
korea
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
it
was
--
it
was
not
treated
so
by
the
military
personnel
and
particularly
by
the
financial
arrangements.
i'd
like
to
turn
quickly
to
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
they
did
not.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
president
of
the
philippines
here
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
not
to
incorporate
them,
he
called
them
into
service
under
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
executive
provision.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
the
language
used
there
is
taken
almost
verbatim
from
the
independence
act
providing
--
giving
the
authority
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
but
the
--
the
united
states
actually
did,
more
clearly
indicated
by
the
appropriations
act
to
appropriate
the
funds
for
this.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
i'm
interpreting
if
i
may,
if
it
please
your
honor,
the
--
what
was
meant
by
into
the
service.
they
did
not
use
the
constitutional
phrase
into
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
used
everytime
heretofore.
they
used
the
phrase
“into
the
service.”
i
don't
get
much
help
from
that
but
at
least
i
get
the
point
that
they
have
not
used
the
same
language
they've
used
whenever
they
have
called
troops
or
national
guard
into
the
armed
--
they
called
them
into
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
here,
an
organized
force
as
such
which
could
only
be
used
in
the
philippines
as
we
read
the
statutes,
only
be
called
to
those
into
the
service
of
such
of
our
forces
as
were
actually
in
the
philippines.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
would
be
delighted.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
following
that
order,
people
went
to
--
the
military
went
to
congress
to
request
funds
for
appropriations
to
meet
these
expenses
of
the
philippine
army.
it
was
first
suggested
that
they
should
be
met
from
excised
tax
funds
that
were
being
held
entrust
for
the
philippine
government.
this
is
after
the
order
calling
them
up.
it
was
assumed
that
the
united
states
would
not
meet
them
from
its
funds
but
from
excised
funds
that
were
to
be
held
to
be
released
in
1946.
they
went
and
asked
congress
for
authority
to
release
these
in
a
premature
fashion,
early.
congress
said,
"why
are
you
doing
this,
isn't
this
in
expense
of
ours?"
the
testimony
which
i'm
particularly
interested
in
is
on
104
in
the
appendix
of
our
basic
brief.
colonel
moore
explained
to
the
army
on
october
1941
what
the
arrangements
were
between
the
two
forces.
in
the
middle
of
page
104,
congressman
cole
asked
them
why
they're
to
be
exempted
from
the
general
accounting
office
requirements.
and
the
colonel
explains
that
the
army
of
the
philippines
is
organized,
paid
and
administered
in
accordance
with
philippine
commonwealth
laws
and
regulations.
what
about
the
funds,
said
congressman
cole?
colonel
moore,
during
the
current
emergency,
every
established
agency
of
the
philippine
army
should
perform
the
functions
prescribed
by
philippine
law
for
such
agencies.
it
is
impractical,
i'm
skipping
a
little
few
words,
to
disrupt,
during
the
current
emergency,
present
philippine
practice
and
procedure
in
order
that
the
philippine
army
might
comply
with
the
strict
procedures
prescribed
by
general
accounting
office
for
the
united
states
procurements.
these
were
the
procurements
for
the
philippine
army
to
be
distinguished
from
the
united
states
procurements.
the
purpose
of
this,
i
must
say,
was
to
keep
the
philippine
to
respect
the
integrity
and
independence
of
a
government
which
we
were
fostering
at
that
time.
this
was
not
the
poised
--
poised
responsibility
on
them
except
for
the
purposes
of
having
them
learn
independence
by
the
experience
of
responsibility.
the
united
states
has
--
we
--
had
a
few
brief
years
interrupted
by
the
wars
in
which
to
help
the
philippine
government
assume
the
burdens.
the
appropriations
were
handled
in
a
way
to
give
them
the
maximum
chance
to
exercise
that
responsibility.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
the
statute
which
was
passed,
the
appropriations
act
of
1941
indicates
clearly
that
whether
the

it

they

rather
than
apart
of

mr.

that's

well,
basically
this
question
turns
on
accounting
whether
these

were
against

and
we
would
provide

through
the
procedures
adopted

whether

to
keep

and
i

this
is
on

we

there
was
no

in

anyone,
general

the
congress
that
the

had

they
had
called

under
arrangements
they
have
with

that
they
should
appropriate
funds
to
meet
all

part
of

should
be

by
a

mr.

mr.
roger
d.

a
--
a
distinction,
which
i
think
in
the
light
of
the
documents,
indicates
it
was
not
the
intention
of
anybody
that
every
philippine
soldier
could
--
well
--
or
any
philippine
officer
was
an
officer
of
the
united

who
had
the
same
implied
power
that
an
american
officer
have.
mr.
roger
d.

i
say
we'd
never
use
the
same
language.
i
think
the
nato
treaty
arrangements,
one
can
--
a
government
can
call
certain
units
in,
has
power
to
command
them
--
mr.
roger

fisher
into
the
service
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
of
the
united
states
in
the
philippines.
it
is
supposed
to
be
--
we
--
we
could
not
call
them
into
service
of
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states
even,
in
general.
we
could
not
have
called
them
over
to
europe
as
we
read
the
statute.
we
could
only
call
them
into
the
service
of
those
units
of
ours
which
were
in
the
philippines
defending
the
philippine
army.
i
think
it
is
a
quite
a
different
status,
a
status
which
has
been
recognized
by
--
say
by
--
mr.
roger

it
depends

or
you
could
make
a
holding
that
would
be
against
us
that
would
be
narrow
enough
only
to
affect
this
case.
i
think
that
--
mr.

i
think
if
base
it
on
any
--
any
such
broad
principle
as
justice

suggested
of
the

the
military
arm

you
might
get
yourself
where
you
would
affect
our
other
military
arrangements.
mr.

the
--
if
petitioner
here
were
alleging
express
authority,
communicated
to
him
by
any
cable

verbal

and
if
that
were
the
basis
for
his
contention,
i
only
suggest
that's
not
the
issue
he
raised
on
certiorari.
issue
on
certiorari
is
whether
members
of
the
philippine
armed
forces,
who
fell
in
a
certain
broad
category,
have
that
authority
not
whether
express

the

the
power
that
can
be
implied
by
emergency,
can
be

by

necessity,
can
only
be
implied
into
an
officer
or
into
an
agent
who,
in
the
normal
course
of

had
some
agency
relationship
to
the

no
matter
how
desperate
his
emergency,
he
could
not
sign
a

of

you
have
to
find
that
prior

during

he
had
some
such
agency
relationship

the

necessary

mr.

yes,
they
were
recognized.
the
guerrilla
units
were
recognized
and
it's
the
second
leg
perhaps
that
is
argued.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
but
there
again,
they
are
recognized
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
status
of
members
of
these
units
is
that
of
officers
and
enlisted
men
of
the
philippine
army,
i'm
reading
from
page
63b,
it
is
further
desired
that
payment
--
as
found
at
bottom
of
our
paragraph
4,
that
same
order
to
which
he
refer,
it
is
further
desired
that
payment
of
these
units
be
facilitated
by
finance
officers
of
the
philippine
army
taxed
to
your
commands.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
63b
of
the
brief.
you
have
six
briefs,
i'm
sorry
that
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
every
--
every
recognition
order
which
we
have
found
in
which
petitioners
caught
our
attention
stated
specifically
to
avoid
any
confusion
of
the
status
of
any
units
listed
of
--
listed
or
recognized
as
members
of
the
philippine
army
and
they
were
paid
from
these
same
funds.
i
would
like
if
i
might,
just
briefly
on
the
fact,
this
is
a
question
which
is
still
under
consideration
with
the
--
i
was
--
the
government
was
suggesting
we
try
to
deprive
this
court
of
jurisdiction
over
this
matter
by
saying
this
is
one
for
which
you
ought
to
give
weight
to
the
--
to
the
determinations
of
the
executive
branch.
that
was
not
our
intention.
now,
we
think
the
court
--
the
views
of
the
executive
branch
to
which
we
referred
are
those
establishing
--
setting
up
and
operating
under
an
arrangement,
this
arrangement
between
the
two
--
two
armies,
between
the
commanders
which
for
15
years
have
been
considered
by
the
united
states
government
and
by
the
philippine
government
as
far
as
i
know,
at
least
by
the
philippine
army,
the
operating
factor,
they
will
operate
as
separate
unit
without
liability
directly
against
the
united
states
with
liability
against
the
philippine
treasury
which
the
united
states
as
intergovernmental
matter,
government
to
government
with
me.
we
suggest
that
this
is
a
--
right
now,
pending
--
and
at
the
political
level,
between
the
two
governments
is
the
question
of
the
return
of
the
25
or
so
million
dollars
which
the
united
states
have
advanced
which
is
above
the
cost
of
the
philippine
army
as
considered
by
the
american
military
commanders.
the
--
this
money
was
promised
to
be
returned
and
it
has
not
been
returned
in
accordance
with
the
snyder-romulo
agreement
of
further
discussions.
the
philippine
government
aren't
going
on.
the
philippine
government
has
raised
with
the
united
states
at
the
diplomatic
level,
the
question
of
the
pay
level
for
all
members
of
the
philippine
army.
they
had
a
different
enlisted
men
who
were
paid
at
a
rate
for
one
peso
instead
of
being
the
equivalent
of
half
a
dollar
was
considered
as
a
dollar
under
philippine
army
law.
they
received
the
lower
rate
of
pay.
one
of
the
claims
pending
is
under
various
orders
created
in
the
philippines,
all
members
of
the
philippine
army
should
receive
the
same
pay
to
vadilify
that
they
are
officers
in
the
american
armed
forces.
other
matters
relate
to
--
to
housing,
allowances,
quarters
allowances
while
they
were
guerrillas,
all
these
questions
are
not
in
this
case
but
a
decision
by
the
court
in
this
case
would
certainly
have
a
bearing
on
petitioner
in
this
--
the
yellow
brief,
page
35
at
the
very
end.
how
the
payment
of
awards
to
filipino's
has
been
or
will
be
made
whether
by
direct
payments
to
successful
claimants
or
by
payment
to
the
philippine
government
for
distribution
is
of
no
importance
nor
is
it
involved
in
this
case.
we
submit
it
is
involved
in
this
case,
if
your
honors
determine
that
there's
a
direct
liability
against
the
united
states,
the
petitioner
we
paid
from
funds
in
the
treasury
here
not
in
the
funds
which
have
been
appropriated
or
advanced
for
this
purpose
and
that
you
will
have
--
perhaps
reduce
the
political
claim.
but
the
--
a
court
of
claims
judgement
goes
to
the
individual
petitioner
not
to
the
philippine
government.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
think
there
would
have
certainly
been
a
moral
obligation,
i
think
that
the
arrangements
of
1941
by
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
right,
they
could
not
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
to
the
philippine
--
to
the
philippine
government.
we're
--
we
met
--
in
that
case
met
the
large
portion
of
the
expenditures
of
other
military
courses
during
the
war.
other
countries
we
gave
great
financial
assistance.
i
would
like
to
test
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
they
--
yes,
they
were
free
to
pay
certainly
from
their
own
funds.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
right.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
right.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
and
we
would
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
we
would
be
litigating
in
the
court
of
claims,
the
questions
of
the
status
of
these
units.
the
united
states
can
derecognize
guerrillas
as
well
as
recognize
them.
they
have
derecognized
37,000
fraudulent
guerrillas
to
whom
they
have
paid.
if
the
army
chose
to
derecognize
these
guerrillas
on
some
reasonable
basis
on
further
examination,
i
take
it
that
will
eliminate
petitioner's
case.
the
army
does
not
do
that
but
we
go
on
to
the
question
of
whether
this
rice
with
a
military
necessity,
whether
these
officers
were
carrying
on
military
operations
for
the
philippine
government
or
were
they're
feeding
their
friends,
those
questions,
now
15
years
--
10
years
after
the
--
the
events
took
place
be
litigated
here
in
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i'm
sorry.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
right.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
right.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
and
if
you
would
allow
a
judgement
against
the
united
states
beyond
the
funds
appropriated
by
congress
for
this
purpose.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
cannot
state
that
categorically,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
rule
of
thumb
if
the
united
states
army
claims
service
disapproved
the
claim
from
the
funds
advanced
to
united
states,
the
philippine
government
did
not
pay.
as
a
--
as
a
general
practical
matter
whether
they
say
that
some
claims
beyond
that
i
do
not
know.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
they
were
in
financial
states,
most
of
the
time
after
the
war.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
if
i
suggested
that
to
be
accomplished,
i
did
not
mean
too.
i
meant
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
to
say
it
could
not

it
could
be
resolved
in
this
case

embarrassment

to

mr.
roger
d.
fisher
well,
you
--
that
--
that's
all
that's
alleged
to
be
involved
in
this
case
and
that
you
could
--
you
could
certainly
restrict
it
that
way
but
that's
the
bulk
of
the
--
of
the
400,000
claims
filed
wherefore
takings
and
requisitioning
by
guerrillas.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
believe
there
are
35
cases
that
are
pending
in
the
court
of
claims
or
have
been
dismissed
within
the
last
two
years
which
could
be
reconsidered
out
of
the
several
hundred
thousands.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
--
that's
right.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
most
certainly
do
and
i
welcome
your
question.
the
period
--
the
six-year
period
within
which
the
united
states
was
consented
to
be
sued
in
the
court
of
claims
is
a
--
this
is
a
statute
of
consent
contrary
to
common
law.
at
the
time
this
statute
was
adopted
--
first
adopted
in
1863,
there
was
no
common
law
rule
tolling
any
statute
of
limitations
for
period
of
war.
the
--
that
first
case
that
we've
found
holding
a
statute
of
limitations
suspended
was
hanging
out
of
this
court
several
years
after
the
court
of
claims
statute
was
first
adopted.
the
matter
is
one,
as
petitioners
concede,
of
statutory
construction
of
the
language
of
the
court
of
claims
act.
it
is
our
view
that
consent
is
only
by
statute
and
a
statute
of
consent
is
strictly
construed.
the
cases
in
this
court
on
that
point
need
not
decide.
when
congress
intended
the
statute
to
be
suspended
for
war,
it
does
so.
it
has
adopted
a
number
of
statutes
suspending
a
running
of
limitations
during
the
period
of
war,
that's
done
so
from
1864
through
1948.
they
are
cited
in
the
brief.
they
have
done
it
with
--
in
various
ways.
they
neither
said,
“you
shall
have
until
two
years
after
the
date
of
this
act
or
the
period
of
war
shall
be
subtracted
or
you
shall
have
six
months
until
you're
out
of
military
service
or
you
shall
have
a
certain
extension
of
a
period,
one
year
of
--
from
the
end
of
the
war.”
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
first
one,
march
21st,
1864,
was
in
the
homestead
act
and
it
was
dealt
with
the
homestead
act.
the
second
one
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
second
--
the
second
one,
your
honor,
in
june
11th,
1864,
the
special
--
i
have
--
reading
some
notes
if
i
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
your
honor,
the
--
the
second
act
--
the
statutes
are
referred
to
on
pages
40
and
41
of
our
supplemental
brief
dealing
with
the
period
--
the
limitations
question.
the
second
act
of
congress
during
the
civil
war
in
june
was
a
special
act
for
persons
who
because
of
the
civil
war
were
beyond
the
reach
of
legal
process
and
they
tolled
the
war
during
the
period
when
they
--
they
extended
the
period
of
all
statutes
of
limitations,
every
kind
over
which
congress
could
--
could
act,
they
would
do
it
for
all.
they
have
been
--
there
have
been
various
ones,
if
your
honors
are
familiar
with
the
questions
of
statute
of
limitations
in
criminal
cases
where
fraud
against
the
united
states,
the
period
within
which
frauds
could
be
prosecuted
or
indicted
was
extended
until
three
years
after
the
war.
petitioner's
contention
here
is
that
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
you
must
construe
every
single
statute
of
limitations
everywhere.
that's
--
they
--
they
recognized
this
is
one
you
have
a
hard
time
reaching
unless
you
have
such
a
broad
proposition
as
including
an
implied
exception
because
of
the
war.
the
--
in
1948,
this
very
statute,
court
of
claims
statute
on
case
three
of
our
supplemental
brief,
was
amended
to
change
that
if
--
the
amendments
referred
to
in
page
51
out
of
that
brief,
the
--
this
statute
was
amended
to
delete
the
specific
disabilities
which
at
that
time
prohibited
suit,
married
women,
infants,
idiots,
lunatics
and
various
descriptions
and
they
provided
that
a
petition
on
the
claim
of
a
person
under
legal
disability
or
beyond
the
ceased
time
and
claim
accrues
maybe
filed
within
three
years
after
the
disability
ceases.
the
revisers
note
in
explaining
this,
they
--
the
person's
under
legal
disability
could
not
sue,
written
in
a
footnote
on
page
51
and
there's
still
should
be
barred
until
they
become
able
to
sue.
the
revised
language
will
cover
all
legal
disabilities
actually
barring
suit.
the
petitioner
here
could
not
legally
bring
suit.
he
was
barred
from
bringing
suit
during
the
war.
he
could
not
have
brought
suit
until
the
war
was
over
and
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
was
fixed
and
the
common
law
disability
was
lifted.
he
failed
to
file
suit
until
five-and-a-half
years
after
the
end
of
the
war.
as
he
filed
suit
in
1951,
more
than
five-and-a-half
years
after
the
surrender
of
the
japanese
on
september
2,
1945
which
is
the
date
we
will
use,
we
will
both
agree
on
for
this
purpose
as
being
the
end
of
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
an
enemy
under
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act,
a
permanent
resident
of
an
area
occupied
by
an
enemy
is
an
enemy
of
mr.
soriano
within
manila.
he
was
not
a
guerrilla.
he's
--
he's
a
supplier.
he's
a
farmer.
he
is
a
technical
enemy
and
could
not
legally
bring
suit
as
they
have
argued
at
great
length.
he
is
prevented
from
bringing
suit.
the
statute
contains
a
special
exception
for
anybody
who
is
under
disability
which
bars
suit.
this
court
in
the
very
cases
of
hanger
and
abbott
in
the
civil
war
cases
continue
to
refer
to
the
inability
of
a
hostile
or
a
party
who
could
not
reach
the
courts
as
being
a
disability.
these
cases
are
referred
to
in
the
footnote
on
page
52.
it
is
the
position
of
the
united
states
--
i'd
like
to
make
clear
if
i
could
because
we
do
not
support,
we
do
not
adopt
the
position
adopted
by
the
court
of
claims
in
the
maritima
case.
it
is
our
position
that
the
statute
of
limitations,
the
six-year
statutory
period
in
the
court
of
claims
is
absolute
as
to
everyone.
it
is
not
suspended
during
war
by
an
implied
exception
for
the
benefit
of
anybody.
there
is
a
statutory
exception
for
those
who
legally
could
not
bring
suit
during
the
war
and
they
have
three
years
after
the
war
within
which
to
file
suit.
petitioner
did
not
file
suit
either
within
six
years,
the
time
his
claim
accrued
or
within
three
years
of
the
end
of
the
war.
we
believe
that
you
cannot
construe
this
statute
as
he
asks
without
raising
serious
questions
about
all.
consent
statutes,
all
the
tax
refund
claim
periods
during
war
as
among
people
already
situated
and
of
course
hard
to
reach.
he
is
asking
a
construction
of
this
statute.
he
tries
to
make
the
statute
seem
inequitable
so
that
you
have
to
construe
it
as
an
implied
exception.
the
statute
is
not
absurd
and
it
is
not
inequitable
on
its
face.
everybody
who
is
barred
by
war
has
three
years
after
the
war
within
which
to
file
a
suit.
that's
in
the
statute.
that's
a
far
easier
exception
to
find
than
one
which
says
that
the
whole
period
when
the
statute
says
six
years,
that
means
six
years
plus
whatever
time
there
is
disability.
the
last
requisitioning
here
occurred
in
january
1945.
manila
was
liberated
in
february
1945.
the
mail
service
--
commercial
mail
service
of
the
united
states
opened
on
april
16,
1945.
it
was
more
than
six
years
after
the
commercial
mail
service
is
opened
that
suit
was
here
barred.
we
believe
claim
does
not
fall
within
the
period
of
consent
allowed
by
congress
and
the
process
in
each
of
the
question
decide
than
the
--
one
of
our
certiorari
was
granted.
we
believe
in
these
phases,
the
petition
must
be
dismissed.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
record
below
consists
of
the
allegations
in
the

of
the
petition
in
the
court
of
claims.
it
sets
forward
the
facts
which
we
assume
for
the
purpose
of
this
litigation
of
the
guerrilla
status
of
the

mr.
roger
d.

that's
right.
those

no,
those
documents
are
not
here.

had
access
to

they're
not

mr.

know
of,
and
i
will
see
that
