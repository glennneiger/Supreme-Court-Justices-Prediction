mr.
j.
lee
rankin
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
from
the
dismissal
of
an
indictment
under
the
corrupt
practices
act
as
amended.
the
question
presented
is
whether
an
offense
is
stated
under
section
610
of
title
18,
the
criminal
code,
by
an
indictment
charging
that
on
a
certain
date,
defendant,
labor
union
made
an
expenditure
of
specified
sums
from
its
general
treasury
fund
to
pay
the
expenses
of
a
particular
political
television
broadcast
over
a
commercial
television
station
where
the
broadcast
was
intended
to
influence
the
electorate
generally,
to
support
the
election
of
certain
candidates
for
federal
officers.
motion
was
made
to
dismiss
the
indictment
on
the
ground
that
it
was
unconstitutional
to
apply
it
to
the
expenditures
described
in
the
indictment.
it
was
too
vague
and
number
of
other
constitutional
reasons.
the
indictment
alleged
in
rather
general
terms
in
accordance
with
modern
criminal
practice
the
nature
of
the
offense
in
four
accounts.
it
lead
to
the
payment
of
specified
sums
of
money
ranging
from
$700
to
$2500
to
a
named
company
to
defray
the
expenses
of
political
television
broadcast
urging
and
endorsing
the
selection
of
particular
candidates
or
a
name,
commercial
television
station
in
which
the
appellees
had
no
interest.
it
was
alleged
that
the
telecast
included
expressions
of
political
advocacy
and
intended
by
appellee
to
influence
the
electorate,
generally,
including
voters
who
were
not
members
of
the
appellee
union
and
to
affect
the
results
of
the
election.
it
was
further
alleged
that
the
money
expended
was
taken
out
of
the
general
fund
of
the
appellee
and
not
from
any
other
source.
that
the
general
fund
consisted
of
union
dues
paid
by
members
of
local
unions
belong
to
and
affiliated
with
the
appellee
and
that
expenditure
was
not
made
from
voluntary
political
contributions
or
from
subscriptions
by
appellees
members.
we
call
particular
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
the
c.i.o.
case
decided
by
this
court,
the
indictment
was
specific,
as
this
court
said,
in
regard
to
the
details
of
the
expenditures,
how
they
were
made,
what
they
were
made
for.
in
this
case,
the
indictment
was
not
so
specific.
no
bills
of
--
a
motion
for
bills,
in
particular,
were
filed
so
that
the
issue
now
before
the
court
is
whether
the
indictment
is
sufficient
on
its
phase
to
state
a
cause
of
action
under
the
statute.
we
have
a
controversy
between
counsel
as
evidenced
in
the
brief
--
briefs
as
to
whether
the
court
reinterpret
or
construe
the
indictment
so
as
to
limit.
the
government
contends
that
there
was
no
construction
by
the
lower
court
to
limit
this
indictment.
such
action
was
not
proper
and
the
court
did
not
attempt
to
take
any
such
action.
the
government
did
not
acquiesce
in
any
such
construction
but
contended
throughout
with
this
indictment
was
broad
enough
to
cover
active
electioneering.
and
it's
our
position
before
the
court
that
the
construction
that
this
indictment
does
not
state
a
cause
of
action,
under
this
statute
is
so
broad
that
even
a
--
a
--
an
action
which
would
involve
a
statement
on
the
telecast
day
after
day,
vote
for
x,
the
union's
friend,
would
not
be
a
violation
under
the
construction.
in
order
to
support
the
point
that
the
court
did
not
undertake
to
reconstrue
or
limit
this
indictment
in
any
way,
we
call
particular
attention
to
several
different
items.
first,
on
page
21
of
the
printed
record,
the
last
paragraph,
the
court
relates,
if
ideas
of
what
the
indictment
charges.right
now,
as
i
take
the
position
of
the
defendant
and
if
i
am
not
correct
right
correctly.
in
the
first
place,
even
admitting
that
congress
had
the
right
to
include
the
word,
"expenditures."
first,
petitioner,
defendant's
position
is
that
those
are
not
the
expenditures,
items
like
this,
as
alleged
in
the
indictment.
those
are
not
the
type
of
expenditures
that
congress
had
in
mind
and
that
this
court
in
trying
to
give
a
constitutional
--
in
trying
to
interpret
the
law
constitutionally,
couldn't
make
any
other
decision
except
that
they
are
not
that
kind
of
expenditures.
then
your
second
point
is
that
if
they
are
included
within
the
expenditures,
then
the
act
is
unconstitutional
for
a
lot
of
reasons.
those
questions
were
addressed
to
counsel
for
the
appellee
and
the
answer
is
-
"that
would
be."
the
court
interposing,
"is
that
right"?
the
answer
is,
"that
is
a
very
accurate
summary
of
our
basic
position,
your
honor."
next
as
is
contended
that
in
our
briefs,
we
did
not
urge
this
point
about
active
electioneering
as
we
do
before
this
court.
and
i
call
your
--
the
court's
particular
attention
to
two
portions
of
our
briefs
which
we
have
filed
with
the
clerk.
one,
and
this
is
not
in
the
briefs
that
we've
--
our
printed
briefs
before
this
court
page
53
of
our
principal
brief
before
the
lower
court.
we
discussed
in
the
second,
full
paragraph
in
detail
the
position
about
active
electioneering
and
say
amongst
other
things
in
that
paragraph,
"and
no
corporation
or
labor
organization
spending
money
actively
to
electioneer
for
the
success
or
defeat
of
a
particular
candidate
can
--
can
have
any
doubt
that
its
activity
in
such
respect
contravenes
the
express
prohibition
of
the
statute.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
want
to
be
sure
as
we
had
a
square
issue
before
the
court
that
we
were
arguing
and
the
proposition
that
i
am
trying
to
rebut
is
the
contention
that
the
lower
court
limited
that
the
indictment
by
interpretation
in
such
a
way
that
this
court
could
not
squarely
determine
at
this
time
or
examine
the
issue
as
to
whether
the
indictment
in
its
full
terms
states
a
cause
of
action
under
the
statute
and
is
contended
in
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
is
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
is
the
position
of
the
government
that
the
indictment
is
--
as
it
has
set
forth
is
sufficiently
broad
so
that
there
would
be
no
act
by
the
appellee
in
active
electioneering
that
would
be
proscribed
by
the
statute
and
it
is
the
contention,
generally
argued
in
the
brief
of
the
appellee.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
i'm
--
i
want
to
deal
with
the
proposition
of
whether
the
court
has
to
face
the
question
of
constitutionality
later
but
here
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
i'm
trying
to
avoid
the
--
the
claim
that
the
lower
court,
so
narrowed
the
construction,
that
at
this
--
that
this
court
does
not
properly
have
the
right,
at
this
time,
to
examine
these
questions
as
to
the
effect
of
this
indictment.
that
the
court
did
not
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
narrowed
the
indictment
by
interpretation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
deal
with
directly
because
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
the
issue
was
so
narrowed
that
this
isn't
properly
a
direct
appeal
to
this
court
but
should
have
gone
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
in
view
of
the
interpretation
placed
upon
it
by
the
lower
court.
and
i
wanted
to
make
clear
that
we
argued
from
the
start
that
the
indictment
should
be
examined
according
to
its
face
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
against
the
statute.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
contention
is
made
at
some
length
in
brief.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
i'm
trying
to
make
it
clear
that
we
made
the
issue
before
the
lower
court,
at
all
times,
the
full
breadth
of
the
indictment
and
that
we
are
arguing
it
before
this
court
and
that
the
argument
that
we
limited
the
indictment
in
anyway
or
consented
or
acquiesced
to
a
limitation
by
the
lower
court
or
that
the
lower
court
did
in
fact
limit
the
indictment
by
construction
in
anyway,
so
as
not
to
have
the
full
effect
of
the
indictment
before
this
court
is
not
valid.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
appears
to
the
government
that
the
court
was
following
the
--
or
said
it
was
following
the
c.i.o.
case
by
this
court
and
the
painter
case
in
some
respects
in
which
--
which
it
questioned
some
of
the
reasoning
of
the
painter
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
mr.
justice.
the
difference
is
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
if
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
if
the
court
--
the
lower
court
would
say
that
in
this
indictment,
when
it
says,
expenditure,
it
really
isn't
expenditure
but
it's
a
purchase
or
some
other
interpretation
of
the
language
so
you
don't
have
in
it
a
direct
issue
with
regard
to
the
particular
statute
but
you
have
an
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
an
error
that
should
have
gone
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
its
examination.
that
is
the
type
of
controversy
that
we
think
is
raised
by
the
point
of
mr.
justice
black,
who
just
called
attention
to
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
again,
in
our
reply
brief
which
is
not
in
our
printed
brief,
on
page
4,
we
dealt
with
direct
electioneering
as
being
an
issue
in
the
case.
we
also
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
the
opinion,
which
we
have
set
out
portions
of
in
our
brief,
on
pages
3,
4
and
5,
our
reply
brief.
the
court
dealt
in
considerable
detail
with
its
reasoning
as
to
the
indictment,
its
interpretation
and
application
of
the
painters'
case,
the
construction
and
general
labors
local
union
case
and
the
c.i.o.
case
of
this
court
and
showed
clearly
that
it
was
interpreting
and
trying
to
give
legal
effect
to
the
indictment
as
a
whole
as
it
was
stated
and
that
as
it
so
applied
it,
it
was
not
a
violation
of
the
statute.
the
order
of
the
court
was
it
is
concluded
that
said
motion
should
be
granted
and
the
indictment
dismissed
upon
the
ground
at
the
expenditure
charged
in
the
indictment
are
not
expenditures
prohibited
by
law
and
that
the
indictment
therefore,
fails
to
state
facts
sufficient
to
constitute
an
offense
against
the
united
states.
in
effect
then
we
--
that
it's
the
government's
position
that
the
holding
of
the
lower
court
was
to
the
effect
that
any
political
broadcast
under
union
auspices
regardless
of
how
broadly
or
how
narrowly
it
is
stated
in
behalf
of
particular
candidates
urging
their
election
at
a
federal
election
is
not
a
violation
of
the
statute
if
the
expenditure
is
made
for
that
purpose.
the
position
of
the
government
that
the
court
does
not
have
to
reach
the
constitutional
question
in
consideration
of
this
case,
that
the
indictment
is
such
and
the
form
of
it
that
the
matter
is
not
precisely
before
this
court.
it
is
not
a
logical
necessity
that
the
court
examine
the
constitutional
question
at
this
time
but
that
the
case
should
go
back
to
the
--
remanded
to
the
lower
court
for
its
consideration
or
it
can
be
examined
and
an
acquittal
would
relieve
this
court
of
any
consideration
of
the
question
and
a
conviction
would
have
it
in
such
a
precise
form
in
accordance
with
the
decision
to
this
court
that
you
could
determine
with
exactitude
the
issues
that
are
involved
and
the
exact
facts
as
to
which
the
matter
is
to
be
applied.
the
court
did
rely
on
the
painters'
case
and
compared
to
case,
now,
before
the
court
as
being
like
two
peas
in
a
pod,
comparing
it
with
the
painters'
case.
there,
the
amounts
that
were
paid
for
the
political
broadcasting
where
$32.50
and
for
the
newspaper
advertising,
$111.42
with
decision
by
the
circuit
--
the
second
circuit
and
the
court
treated
that
case
as
being
controlled
by
the
facts.
the
expenditure
was
authorized
by
the
union
and
the
court
particularly
comment
upon
that
fact
in
a
general
union
meeting
and
the
union
had
no
radio
or
newspaper
of
its
own
and
the
court
found
that
it
was
a
natural
way
for
the
union
to
convey
its
used
to
its
members
when
it
didn't
have
a
newspaper
or
radio
of
its
own.
it
also
held
that
the
amounts
were
de
minimis.
the
lower
court
here
was
unwilling
to
accept
the
argument
that
it
was
de
minimis
saying
that
that
was
not
properly
applicable
in
criminal
cases
and
rejected
that
part
but
accepted
the
decision
otherwise.
the
court
did
also
apply
the
c.i.o.
decision
of
--
by
this
court
and
held
that
it
was
not
intended
by
congress
that
the
expenditure
of
the
types
described
in
this
--
in
this
indictment
were
to
be
prescribed
by
this
section
of
the
statute.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
and
that
we
never
at
any
time
gave
up
that
contention
before
the
lower
court
or
in
any
argument
or
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
we
recognize
there
are
many
rules
that
this
court
has
applied
in
regard
to
constitutional
construction
and
not
to
reach
that
question
and
how
properly
to
reach
it
when
the
matter
should
be
examined
by
this
court.
and
generally,
those
rules
are
to
the
effect
that
the
questions
should
be
in
some
precise
form
so
that
the
court
cannot
fairly
determine
the
case
without
examining
that
question
squarely
and
we
do
not
think
that
--
that
is
present
at
this
time
in
this
case.
it
might
very
well
had
been
present
if
motions
for
bills
of
particular
had
been
required
in
this
case,
made
and
granted
and
the
facts
had
been
set
out
in
detail
so
the
court
could
have
before
it
at
this
time
the
limits
of
the
expenditures,
what
they
were
made
for,
the
character,
the
telecast,
and
all
of
the
detail
that
would
be
involved
or
that
--
that
could
come
back
before
the
court
on
a
later
date
if
there
was
a
conviction
under
the
indictment.
but
the
present
time,
the
form
of
this
indictment
is
so
broad
that's
charging
the
appellee
with
these
expenditures
for
particular
broadcast
on
and
telecasting
station
they
did
not
own
for
the
purpose
of
advancing
the
candidacy
of
particular
candidates
and
influencing
the
public
to
vote
on
behalf
of
those
candidates
and
intending
to
affect
the
election.
that
is
the
government's
position
that
--
that
this
indictment
is
not
stated
crime
under
this
statute.
the
statute
could
not
be
effective
for
any
purpose.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that
the
question
of
vagueness
is
not
involved
in
the
indictment.
i
think
that
indictment
is
sufficient
on
its
face
to
charge
the
essential
elements
of
the
crime
as
set
out
in
the
statute
and
the
lack
of
further
precision
is
a
matter
to
be
reached
by
a
motion,
a
bill
of
particulars,
rather
than
the
question
of
whether
indictment
states
a
crime
on
its
face.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that's
correct.
and
that's
where
we
take
the
position
that
the
lower
court
did
not
report
to
limit
the
indictment
by
construction
in
anyway
but
held
that
it
did
not
state
a
--
a
crime
under
the
statute.
therefore,
we
contend
that
this
court
must
--
must,
at
this
time,
examine
the
allegations
of
the
indictment.
the
holdings
of
the
lower
court
in
which
it
found
that
the
indictment
is
not
sufficient
under
the
statute,
again,
to
examine
that
against
the
face
of
the
statute
is
to
see
whether
the
court
was
in
error
in
the
interpretation
or
the
decision
that
he
went.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
facts
are
sufficiently
precise
for
the
court
to
consider
that
it
should
reach
the
constitutional
question
and
it's
the
examination
of
a
matter
at
this
time
and
under
a
number
of
your
decisions,
you
have
decided
at
various
times
that
you
would
not
reach
the
--
a
constitutional
question
where
the
facts
were
not
precisely
before
you.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
--
it
seems
to
me
that
you
had
one,
a
rescue
army
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
where
you
send
it
back
and
said
that
the
man
would
go
back
the
third
time
for
a
--
a
hearing
in
regard
to
the
matter
rather
than
examine
him
to
the
constitutional
question
in
view
of
the
way
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
was
in
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
state
court
and
the
court
sent
it
back
although
it
remarked
about
the
fact
that
it
was
the
third
time
the
man
would
have
to
face
trial
before
the
court.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
let
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
contention
of
the
government
and
this
position
of
the
government,
you
have
to
back
to
the
indictment
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
and
examine
the
--
the
terms
of
indictment
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
is
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
or
you
could
examine
it
here
and
if
you
think
that
it
is
sufficiently
precise
in
the
elements
or
the
detail
of
a
description
of
the
various
acts
contemplated
under
the
telecast
or
--
or
the
other
charge
in
the
indictment,
you
could
that
then
examine
it
here
but
under
your
decisions,
you
often
said
that
where
they
are
not
sufficiently
precise
and
the
detail
would
be
shown
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
that
you
would
send
this
back
to
the
lower
court
and
examine
that
question
when
the
matter
comes
to
in
such
form
that
you
can
examine
exactly
the
--
according
to
logical
necessity
what
the
facts
are
and
apply
the
constitutional
questions
to
that,
to
those
facts.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
we
think
that's,
as
far
as
the
court
needs
to
go,
in
its
action
in
this
case,
to
send
it
back
to
the
--
case
back
find
the
x
as
charged
in
the
indictment
are
sufficient
and
within
the
statute
and
the
case
should
be
sent
back
to
occur
determination,
and
then
the
court
might
examine
whether
there
was
a
precise
question
that
ever
came
before
the
court
again.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
is
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
is
right.
so
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
there's
an
acquittal
in
the
court
doesn't
have
that
to
consider.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
now,
we
urge
that
this
statute
involves
more
than
freedom
of
speech.
it
involves
a
spending
of
money.
the
speech,
the
urging
to
action
and
the
intent
to
influence
vote,
and
there's
something
like,
in
the
court's
interpretations
in
the
past,
to
a
picketing
case
in
which
the
court
has
found
that
there
is
more
than
freedom
of
speech
that
there
is
action
and
that
in
examining
these
questions
in
regard
to
the
constitutionality
which
i
feel
we
need
now
to
go
into,
at
least
briefly
before
the
court,
that
it
should
be
kept
in
mind
that
there
are
these
other
elements
in
addition
to
speech
involved
in
this
statute
and
this
indictment.
the
question
that
is
before
the
court
in
regard
to
the
constitutional
question
whether
or
not
there
is
encroachment
upon
freedom
of
speech,
whether
the
statute
is
vague,
indefinite,
whether
it's
discriminatory.
and
in
examining
each
of
these
questions,
we
turn
to
the
--
the
power
of
congress
to
pass
such
a
statute
and
not
examine
the
wisdom
of
it.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
there
is
validity
to
the
particular
means
chosen
by
the
congress
in
trying
to
deal
with
the
problem
at
hand
in
this
statute.
congress
had
several
things
that
this
court
is
familiar
with
in
the
c.i.o.
case
discussed
that
it
was
trying
to
deal
with
and
provide
for
in
passing
this
statute.
it
was
trying
to
minimize
the
influence
of
unions
at
elections,
protect
the
purity
of
elections
so
as
to
not
have
obligations
between
unions
and
the
various
candidates
or
unions
or
corporations
and
the
various
candidates
because
of
contributions
or
expenditures.
it
was
also
very
clearly
trying
to
protect
the
minority,
the
union
members
upon
--
against
the
use
of
union
funds
by
assessment
or
dues
or
general
funds
of
the
union
for
political
purposes
against
their
will.
there
are
a
number
of
interests
involved.
recalling
to
your
attention
the
--
first,
the
union
entity
which
has
certain
rights
that
the
government
does
not
question
in
presenting
its
thoughts,
and
its
political
position
to
the
public
but
it
is
a
non-voter
and
there
corporations
were
also
covered
by
the
same
statute
and
they
have
certain
rights
to
present
their
position
but
they
are
non-voters.
and
the
last
but
not
least
are
the
voters,
both
union
members
and
the
public
generally
who
have
a
right
to
have
their
position
presented
to
the
public.
in
examining
this
question,
the
court
recognized
in
the
c.i.o.
case
that
the
electioneering
process
is
a
very
important
part
of
the
effect
upon
voting,
the
determination
of
elections,
and
that
is
what
congress
is
trying
to
reach
in
dealing
with
this
subject
in
this
section
of
the
statute.
it
was
trying
to
remove
or
at
least
in
part
remove
the
effect
of
the
aggregations
of
wealth,
both
in
corporation
form
and
labor
organization
form
from
affecting
the
electoral
process
in
a
way
that
congress
thought
was
not
in
the
best
interest
of
the
country.
the
court
has
recognized
in
a
number
of
different
cases,
the
power
of
congress
to
act
in
this
field
in
the
protection
of
elections,
involving
choice
of
congressional
representatives,
a
number
of
other
cases
that
the
court
is
familiar
with.
they
have
a
broad
authority
to
provide
protection
for
the
electoral
process
and
this
is
another
example
where
congress
was
trying
to
provide
and
protect
that
process
from
an
influence
that
it
considered
whether
wisely
or
not
to
be
detrimental
to
the
public
interest.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
it
is
different,
mr.
justice
black,
in
several
respects.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
under
the
decisions
of
the
court
that
a
entity
has
the
same
rights
as
an
individual
in
this
area
and
furthermore,
there
is
no
prohibition
as
to
the
labor
organization
entity
being
able
to
be
active
in
this
field
and
bringing
its
political
ideas
before
the
public
in
many
forms.
the
c.i.o.
case
held
that
it
could
do
so
through
its
union
publications,
to
its
union
members,
and
there's
nine
or
almost
ten
years
of
experience
now
where
through
the
pac
and
the
(inaudible)
organization
and
political
activity
and
the
new
cope,
the
labor
organizations.
the
cope
is
the
new
one
by
the
consolidated
unions
have
exercised
very
broad
activity
in
this
field
in
regard
to
bringing
their
position
on
political
issues
before
the
public
and
it
is
only
in
the
area
where
they
are
using
the
general
funds
of
the
union
for
this
purpose
that
there
is
the
proscription
and
that
is
what
the
indictment
alleges
and
that's
what
the
statute
proscribes
is
not
like
a
person
using
his
own
funds
or
is
not
like
the
union
using
funds
through
the
pac
or
the
cope
to
carry
on
political
activity.
they
have
gotten
very
substantial
subscriptions
over
the
years,
by
voluntarily
to
the
--
those
various
entities
that
are
--
carry
on
their
political
activities
and
those
have
been
even
directly
contributed
to
various
candidates
for
their
electioneering
processes
or
they
have
been
used
by
the
union
to
carry
on
the
presentation
with
portion.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
it
is
a
--
it
is
an
association.
most
unions
are
associations
and
they
are
different
than
corporations
by
reason
of
that,
of
course.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there
isn't
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
they
did.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
because
there
was
no
record
and
the
indictment
does
not
describe
whether
they
did
or
did
not.
it
says
that
they
were
using
general
funds
of
the
union
for
this
purpose.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
we
try
to
describe
in
our
briefs
the
procedure
and
in
these
various
political
activity,
groups
like
the
pac
and
the
cope
that
they
have.
they
do
have
an
organization
which
is
controlled
considerably
by
the
leadership
of
the
unions
in
determining
what
political
activity
would
be
carried
on
and
what
candidates
will
be
supported
and
generally
it's
the
government's
position,
as
argued
in
the
briefs,
that
the
membership
of
the
unions
do
not
have
an
opportunity
to
vote
on
this
particular
matters.
now
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
pac
is
the
c.i.o's
old
organization.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
political
activity.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
it
comes
from
the
various
voluntary
subscriptions
by
members
from
--
whoever
cares
to
contribute
to
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
and
it
isn't
--
is
not
the
activity
of
the
pac
or
the
cope
at
all.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
would
think
so
under
that
decision.
the
--
if
you
recall
the
legislative
history,
the
question
was
--
asked
senator
taft
and
he
was
not
as
clear
in
his
answer
to
that
particular
type
but
i
think
under
that
decision,
it
would
be.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
well,
that
has
been
going
on
for
a
long
time
and
the
government
has
not
taken
any
action
about
it
to
answer
that
question
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
on
behalf
of
particular
candidates,
this
is
not
presenting
the
labor
organization
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
in
this
case,
go
just
a
little
farther
it
says
in
addition
to
that,
“vote
for
a,
b,
and
c.”
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
the
statute
doesn't
but
the
indictment
does.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
goes
that
far.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
we
say
that
is
a
court
case.
that
is
what
the
statute,
if
it
prohibited
anything,
would
certainly
prohibit
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
the
use
of
its
general
funds
for
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
purpose.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
same
unit
both
ways.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
effect
of
it
is
to
make
those
who
are
usually
protected
although
those,
this
court
has
sought
to
protect
under
the
first
amendment
that
this
isn't
minority
joined
with
the
majority
in
supporting
some
action
that
they
are
not
in
sympathy
with
or
they
are
not
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
think
the
court's
decided
that
question
yet.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
if
it
does
it
by
subscription,
yes
but
if
it
does
--
if
it
makes
free
throws
out
of
it,
the
court
reserved
that
question
in
the
c.i.o.
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes
but
i
think
the
court
dealt
with
that
by
expressly
saying
that
it
wasn't
clear
that
union
funds
were
used
for
that
purpose
and
that
--
or
what
the
source
of
those
funds
were
and
so,
it
did
not
deal
squarely
with
that
particular
situation
and
reserved
the
question
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
if
that
paper
is
maintained
by
subscriptions
like
any
other
newspaper
and
that's
the
source
of
its
support.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
no,
if
they
sell
the
papers,
too.
that
would
also
be
outside.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
they
would
be
because
in
the
one
instance,
they
would
be
engaged
in
the
business
of
operating
this
newspaper
and
part
of
it
would
be
in
the
various
editorial
positions
they
took
in
that
newspaper.
now,
if
they
would
publish
that
ad,
if
that
is
the
question
that
mr.
justice
is
asking
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
say
they'd
made
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
all
right.
say
they
put
a
--
an
ad
in
rent
and
instead
of
a
news
item
in
their
own
paper.
it
is
clear
under
legislative
history
of
this
act
that
that
was
one
of
the
things
that
congress
was
trying
to
proscribe.
if
a
--
a
newspaper
corporation
would
take
a
part
of
its
paper
and
put
an
advertisement
electioneering
for
certain
candidates,
then
it
would
be
within
the
prescription
of
the
act,
too.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
but
they're
operating
their
newspaper
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
the
news
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
the
position.
it
was
taken
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
through
the
legislative
history.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
that
was
paid
for
out
of
general
funds.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
don't
quarrel
with
that
decision
at
all.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
that's
the
case
before
the
court.
i'd
like
to
briefly
call
attention
to
what
the
problem
is
in
this
area
with
regard
to
the
--
the
minority
of
the
union
membership.
when
the
selection
is
made
in
regard
to
the
candidate
that
the
electioneering
is
to
be
done
in
behalf
of
by
the
union,
it
may
very
properly,
as
far
as
the
union
is
concerned,
be
made
upon
the
basis
of
whether
that
candidate
has
supported
particular
legislation
or
activities
or
programs
of
the
labor
organization
and
the
leadership
may
urge
and
wish
to
spend
the
union
funds
for
that
purpose.
on
the
other
hand,
the
individual
in
making
his
choice
about
who
he
would
like
to
support
in
the
electioneering
process
which
is
recognized
by
the
court
as
being
very
close
to
the
electoral
process
may
base
it
upon
the
fact
that
he
knows
the
particular
candidate,
that
he
knows
that
he
supports
other
things
that
are
in
--
are
in
the
interest
of
the
community,
generally,
rather
than
in
the
interest
of
just
labor
organizations
or
that
he
isn't
--
he
is
in
support
of
a
program
in
behalf
of
foreign
relations
or
some
other
position
in
regard
to
support
for
governmental
activity
that
is
attractive
to
him
as
a
basis
for
a
selection
of
a
candidate,
both
for
voting
for
him
and
supporting.
now,
it
is
required
in
--
by
the
union
being
able
to
contribute
union
funds
to
the
electioneering
process
in
the
manner
described
here
in
the
indictment
to
make
his
contribution
of
the
union
funds
in
order
to
even
neutralize
that
in
behalf
of
the
candidate
that
he
is
in
favor
of.
he
has
to
contribute
an
equal
sum
of
money
outside
of
whatever
the
union
contribute
out
of
his
contributions
for
dues
and
otherwise
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
it
was
as
a
part
of
a
regular
business
of
operating
a
union
television
or
telecasting
station,
as
distinguished
from
something
where
you
were
just
electioneering
on
behalf
of
candidates,
the
government
does
not
agree
or
concede
that
if
the
activity
by
the
union
broadcasting
or
telecasting
station
is
on
behalf
of
particular
candidates
or
as
apart
from
the
regular
operation
of
a
union
broadcasting
or
telecasting
station
in
which
there
are
commentators
and
other
people,
union
leaders,
who
appear
on
that
station
and
telecasting
and
present
certain
views
about
labor
matters
as
distinguished
from
supporting
certain
candidates
and
urging
their
election.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
not
at
all,
providing
--
but
in
the
union
on
newspaper,
it
could
not
go
ahead
and
advertise
in
that
and
distribute
that
to
the
general
public.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
that
was
the
regular
business
of
that
newspaper
day
after
day
for
instance
like
certain
commentators
that
are
in
the
washington
post
that
these
are
certain
labor
commentators
that
--
that
they
have
regularly.
that
is
one
of
the
questions
that
senator
taft
said
is
less
clear
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
only
insofar
as
they're
dealing
with
the
general
public.
in
the
union-owned
paper
in
which
they
were
using
the
general
funds
of
the
union,
is
this
court,
as
i
understood,
dealt
with
these
--
with
it
in
the
c.i.o.
case
and
(inaudible)
as
the
basically
distribution
of
the
political
views
of
the
union
to
union
members.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
is
a
substantial
difference.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
if
you
--
it
seems
to
me
there
is
still
certainly
a
case
in
a
gray
area
where
you
have
the
commentator
who
is
a
--
a
man
who's
regularly
on
the
television
station
and
commenting
and
he's
not
engaged
in
active
electioneering
on
--
on
behalf
of
a
particular
candidate.
he
may
have
as
the
senators,
recognize
in
the
debate.
he
may
have
a
lot
of
effect
or
even
more
effect
than
the
man
who
is
actively
electioneering
on
behalf
of
a
particular
candidate.
but
that
is
more
of
senator
taft's,
that
in
the
nature
of
the
regular
operation
of
the
business,
of
the
station.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
certainly
if
a
much
clearer
case
where
he
is
employed
but
for
the
purpose
of
electioneering
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
i
think
that
espousing
the
cause
of
parties
would
also
be
but
generally,
it
has
been
applied
to
particular
candidates.
they're
always
advocating
the
election
or
support
of
particular
persons
who
happen
to
be
identified
with
parties
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i'm
not
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
to
answer
that,
that's
another
unclear
case
according
to
legislative
history.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
its
question
whether
he
is
actually
electioneering
on
behalf
of
particular
candidates
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
he
was
being
--
if
he
was
electioneering
and
that
was
what
he
was
being
paid
for
by
the
corporation
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
would
be
the
same
problem
as
the
other.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
what
congress
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
of
course,
there
is
an
element
of
speech
as
well
as
payment
for
expenditure
here.
there
isn't
any
question
about
that,
but
it's
also
a
question
of
whether
there
is
a
problem
that
the
congress
is
trying
to
protect
the
public
in
the
electoral
process
in
trying
to
limit
the
manner
in
which
this
could
be
handled
and
there
is
no
prohibition.
there's
a
broad
area
of
which
the
activity
can
be
carried
on
and
to
open
it
up
so
that
corporations
and
labor
organizations,
both,
could
carry
on
such
activity
would
certainly
soon
engulf
the
individual
so
he
had
very
little
(voice
overlap)
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it's
a
question
of
whether
you're
prohibited
from
expressing
political
views
or
whether
you
can
spend
large
sums
of
money
in
a
certain
way
to
express
and
you
have
to
tie
the
two
together
because
that's
what
congress
prescribes,
not
just
expressing
your
views.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
wouldn't
give
them
the
same
power
to
control
as
they
would
have
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
they
would
have
a
broad
area
of
comment
that
they
could
engage
in.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
couldn't
espouse
a
particular
candidate,
anyway.
that's
what
this
case
is.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
--
the
one
may
have
involved
a
--
a
political
comment
--
the
political
views
that
might
very
well
be
within
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment
on
this
expenditure
for
the
purpose
of
electioneering
on
behalf
of
a
particular
candidate
is
something
quite
different.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
general
discussion
of
the
issues
is
--
is
available
to
anyone
under
the
statute.
there's
no
attempt
to
prescribe.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
--
that's
the
issue
before
the
court
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i'd
like
to
clarify
in
regard
to
the
last
remarks
if
i
may
to
the
governmental
position
of
--
in
regard
to
newspapers,
we
first
the
take
position
that
if
the
article
is
in
the
regular
course
of
the
business
as
stated
by
senator
taft
like
editorials
or
any
other
regular
part
of
the
publication,
the
newspaper,
it
is
not
within
the
limitations
of
the
statute.
but
if
the
newspaper
would
take
$10,000
of
its
money
and
put
it
in
an
advertisement
saying
vote
for
x,
we
believe
he
is
good
for
business
or
good
for
newspapers
or
good
for
this
particular
newspaper.
it
would
certainly
be
in
violation
of
the
statute
as
we
view
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
if
it
is
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
if
it
was
a
regular
part
of
the
publication
of
the
news.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
if
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
because
it
cost
the
newspaper
to
publish
an
advertisement
and
they
can't
prove
against
such
an
indictment
that
it
didn't
cost
them
some
money.
they
don't
ordinarily
just
to
give
a
space
away.
now,
if
they
run
it
in
the
regular
news
columns
in
some
ways
so
they
are
discussing
a
candidate
and
it
might
reflect
upon
one
or
favorable
to
another
so
that
it's
merely
the
conduct
of
the
newspaper,
that's
something
else.
senator
taft
discussed
it
with
regard
to
editorialized
and
said,
“that
was
exempt
if
it
was
in
the
regular
conduct
of
the
newspaper.”
we
further
take
the
position
with
--
with
regard
to
a
labor
publication
that
it
can
have
any
subscribers
from
any
portion
of
the
public
that
it
wants
to
as
long
as
those
are
independent
subscriptions
and
it
can
publish
the
same
kind
of
information
that
was
involved
in
the
c.i.o.
case
and
this
court
held
that
as
we
interpret
that
decision.
but
when
you
--
the
court
reserved
the
question
if
you're
going
to
have
free
to
always
or
if
you're
going
to
try
bring
in
the
other
people
who
are
not
a
part
of
your
regular
business
activity.
i'd
just
like
to
say
one
thing
more
that
in
view
of
the
argument
here,
and
the
government
agrees
that
if
this
interpretation
contented
for
by
the
appellee
is
to
be
applied
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
us
that
your
--
this
court
would
be
saying
that
it
held
that
way.
that
congress
has
no
power
to
protect
the
individual
who
after
all
has
the
vote
against
an
electioneering
process
which
in
affect
takes
away
his
freedom
of
choice
at
the
ballot
box,
and
that
was
recognized
by
the
lower
court
in
the
brewers
case
because
if
you
control
so
much
powerful
influence,
and
all
the
money
that
this
--
apparent
that
can
be
thrown
in
by
these
great
entities
of
labor
organizations
on
the
one
end,
and
corporate
structures
on
the
other
to
try
to
control
the
discussion,
the
electioneering
and
the
vote
for
mr.
x.
the
individual
will
only
have
very
small
parts
of
money
to
use
to
try
to
support
his
candidate
and
get
the
support
of
the
other
individual
so
that
he
will
vote
for
him.
he
is
left
so
that
he
hardly
counts
in
the
struggle.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
the
history
was
very
clearly
shown
to
have
been
intended
to
try
to
protect
the
minorities,
and
it
went
back
and
referred
to
the
fact
that
it
was
unfair
to
have
corporations
be
permitted
to
make
contributions
and
that's
the
reason
that
corporate
--
the
corporate
limitation
was
put-in
in
the
earlier
days
before
the
labor
organizations
are
brought
in
to
this
form
of
statute,
because
it
was
considered
to
be
unfair
that
the
management
could
take
corporate
funds
and
use
them
for
political
purposes
against
the
wishes
or
without
the
expressive
proof
of
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
of
the
minority
stockholders.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
but
congress
felt
that
it
should
act
and
protect
the
--
both
the
electoral
process
and
also
the
corporate
stockholders
themselves
from
that
type
of
activity.
and
it
was
referred
in
the
debates
to
the
fact
that
the
same
thing
should
be
done
in
regard
to
the
unions.
now,
there
isn't
any
question
but
what
in
most
cases,
there
isn't
any
unanimity
of
support
for
particular
candidates.
there
might
be
unanimity
of
support
for
issues.
and
i'm
not
saying
that
labor
people
wouldn't
support
particular
issues
that
the
labor
unions
were
advocating
because
often
times
they're
in
complete
agreement
on
that.
and
yet,
they
differ
during
materially
and
violently
about
the
particular
candidates
in
every
election
if
you
examine
it,
it
shows
on
its
face
that
there
are
all
kinds
of
difference
between
the
positions
taken
by
labor
and
labor
leaders
about
a
particular
candidate
and
how
the
people
voted
for
it.
and
you
can
go
into
labor
communities
that
are
almost
90%
or
100%.
you
will
find
the
same
thing.
now,
the
demille
case
is
a
perfect
example
where
mr.
demille
was
under
the
decision,
the
supreme
court
of
california
has
held
that
he
couldn't
belong
to
the
union
and
that
he
would
put
out
the
union
because
he
wouldn't
make
a
contribution
and
assessment
that
they've
made
for
political
activity
and
he
raised
that
very
issue
and
the
court
held
that
it
was
the
--
union
had
a
legal
right
to
put
him
out,
and
that
happened
prior
to
the
history
in
this
case
as
i
recall.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
statute
does
not
have
that
--
that
kind
of
provision.congress
didn't
see
fit
to
attack
it
in
that
manner.
now,
the
english
statutes
did
provide
that
any
member
of
the
union
that
did
not
approve
the
political
activity
could
have
his
funds
withdrawn
and
handled
it
in
that
way.
but
congress
examined
it
from
the
standpoint
of
probably
recognizing
that
the
unions
have
a
great
deal
of
power
under
the
wagner
act
to
exercise
in
the
manner,
state
pressure
in
getting
a
union
shop
and
other
requirements
to
work.
and
therefore,
and
also
the
fact
that
generally
there
was
not
unanimity
and
the
election
showed
it.
and
therefore,
it
tried
to
handle
it
in
this
manner
by
keeping
them
out
of
this
particular
type
of
activity
and
compare
it
exactly
with
the
regulation
of
corporations
in
the
same
field,
but
they
have
all
of
the
activity
where
it
can
be
voluntary,
but
they
can't
compel
it.
that's
the
real
issue.
if
they
can
get
the
subscriptions
of
the
voluntary
contributions
from
their
people
which
they
concede
is
difficult
to
do,
they
can
use
that
all
they
want
to
and
they
have
no
trouble
at
all
with
the
government
under
this
statute
or
any
other.
