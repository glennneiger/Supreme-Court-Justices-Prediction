was
this
a

was
this
union
incorporated?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
union
incorporated?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
the
--
did
the
members
take
any
steps
towards
authorizing
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
and
the
political
activities
committee,
that
--
that
is
a
separate
and
apart
from
the
union.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
am
i
correct
about
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
solicitor,
wouldn't
all
that
be
true
with
this
broadcast
that's
been
made
from
a
union-owned
television
station?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
does
the
government
distinguish
between
the
government-owned
telecasting
station
a
--
i
mean
a
union-owned
telecasting
station
and
union-owned
and
operated
newspaper?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
but
couldn't
it
have
a
--
and
--
or
what
would
be
the
government's
position,
for
example,
in
a
union-owned
newspaper
if
there
were
a
number
of
columnists
whose
articles
appeared
therein
advocating
the
election
of
certain
individuals
and
defeat
of
others?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is,
do
you
make
any
distinction
between
the
union-owned
newspaper
and
the
union-owned
telecast
station
in
that
regard?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that,
of
course,
just
isn't
impossible
in
the
case
of
a
telecast
station.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
unless
you
had
a
closed
circuit
or
something
like
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
knew
(voice
overlap).
do
i
understand
then
the
government
draws
a
line
between
the
kind
of
columnist
whose
job
as
part
of
the
union
aim
and
objective
is
constantly
to
bring
before
the
public
the
union's
point
of
view
as
regards
candidates
for
or
against
union
aims
or
objectives?
is
that
it?
you
differ
between
that
kind
of
columnist
and
the
kind
of
columnist
who
was
just
employed
for
the
purpose
of
an
election?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
that
case,
you
say
that
even
the
case
perhaps
of
the
union-owned
broadcasting
station
come
within
the
ban
of
the
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
is
the
union.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
rauh,
suppose
the
union
took
billboards
all
over
town?
take
the
expense
of
the
rental
or
whatever
it
is
that
you
have
to
pay
them,
these
billboard
space,
will
that
be
within
or
without
the
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
suppose
--
suppose
what
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
suppose
all
that
the
billboard
set
on
it
was,
it
is
to
the
interest
of
the
automobile
workers
that
you
elect
candidate
x.
that's
all
that
the
billboard
says.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
apart
from
that
speech
argument,
will
that
fall
within
or
without
the
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
you're
not
--
as
i
understand
it,
you're
not
relying
on
the
free
speech
argument
to
support
the
expenditure
to
say
“just
that
much”
in
the
way
of
a
paid
commercial
television
broadcast.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
not
suggesting
the
picture,
just
the
poster
that
says,
“nothing
more
than
you
say
is
all
that
you've
said
or
you're
charged
with
having
said
and
paying
for
a
commercial
telecast.”
that
is,
it's
to
the
interest
to
the
uaw
that
you
elect
candidate
x.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
all
you've
said
--
all
that
you've
said
to
me
now
is
that
there
is
no
difference
between
the
paid
telecast
and
the
paid
billboard.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
what
you
said
to
me
is
that
the
more
words
you
say,
the
more
surely
it's
not
an
expenditure.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
doesn't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
that
stand,
the
only
way
you
can
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
can't
get
as
much
the
voluntary
as
you
can
with
dues.
