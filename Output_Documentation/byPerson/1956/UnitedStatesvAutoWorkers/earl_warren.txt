chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rauh,
before
you
get
to
constitutionality,
i
would
--
would
mind
elaborating
just
a
little
on
--
on
what
you
said
to
the
effect
that
this
was
not
a
statute
to
protect
the
minority
in
the
--
in
the
unions.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
do
--
you
stated
it
--
you
didn't
elaborate,
would
you
mind
doing
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
well,
if
you're
going
to
do
it,
then
we
--
all
right,
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
go
right
ahead,
answer
the
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general,
in
assuming
you
do
make
mistakes
in
between
newspapers
and
unions
as
regarded,
what
is
it
based?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general,
would
you
mind
telling
if
there's
anything
in
the
act
or
the
legislative
history
that
shows
that
this
was
in
this
language,
is
in
there
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
minorities'
view.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general,
what
--
what
is
your
answer
to
the
statement
of
mr.
rauh
to
the
effect
of
your
interpretation
of
--
of
this
indictment
or
statute
leads
to
a
conclusion
that
it
would
make
any
difference
whether
--
whether
the
members
--
membership
of
the
union
was
unanimous
or
--
or
not
if
every
member
of
the
union
wanted
to
do
it,
he
would
still
prohibit
them
from
doing
it.
