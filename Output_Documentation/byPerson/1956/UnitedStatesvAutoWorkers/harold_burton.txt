justice
harold
burton
let
me
see
if
i
understand
the
cycle
of
what
you
are
telling
us.
on
page
44
of
the
records,
as
i
understand,
that
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
the
appeals,
of
the
district
court
and
it
says,
“our
decision,”
towards
the
bottom,
“is
that
under
the
authorities,
the
expenditures
in
charge
of
this
indictment
are
not
expenditures
prohibited
by
the
act."
justice
harold
burton
now,
that's
--
that's
the
gist
of
the
--
of
the
opinion,
isn't
it?
justice
harold
burton
yes.
justice
harold
burton
(voice
overlap)
--
the
indictment
to
see
whether
the
acts
charged
as
expenditures
under
that
indictment
are
covered
by
the
act.
justice
harold
burton
and
then
i
understand
you
to
say
that
if
they
--
if
we
should
call
that
they
are
covered
by
the
act
and
send
it
back
to
the
court,
then
the
constitutional
question
would
be
raised
--
justice
harold
burton
--
if
they
so
desire.
justice
harold
burton
yes,
i
--
i
understand
that.
justice
harold
burton
but
we
would
answer
the
question
that
the
government
tended,
we
said,
“yes
the
allegations
are
here
sufficiently
to
convince
us
that
this
is
covered
by
the
act.”
justice
harold
burton
and
for
the
court
to
dismiss
this
indictment.
justice
harold
burton
the
appellee
moved
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
