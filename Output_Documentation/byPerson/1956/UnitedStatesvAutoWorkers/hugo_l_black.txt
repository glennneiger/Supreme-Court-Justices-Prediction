justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
if
you
are
just
in
this.
if
you
are
now
rebutting
the
argument
number
one
to
this
effect
that
the
question
before
this
court
is
sufficiency
of
the
indictment
construed
by
the
district
court
rather
than
the
sufficiency
of
the
indictment
as
interpreted
by
the
government
for
the
first
time
in
this
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
before
agreeing
with
the
statement
mr.
justice
frankfurter
made,
by
being
bound
by
the
construction
given
the
indictment,
that's
sufficiently
precise
that
we
have
to
be
bound
by.
why
do
you
say
that
it
would
have
to
go
back?
let
a
man,
defendants,
go
to
an
entire
trial
before
they
could
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
an
act
which
is
unconstitutional
is
subjecting
them
to
a
trial
that
they
shouldn't
go
through
with.
justice
hugo
l.
black
an
indictment
(inaudible)
to
be
charged
in
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
have.
i'm
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
forgotten.
was
that
a
criminal
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
similar
in
any
way
to
an
act
would
forbid
an
individual
to
pay
for
advertisement
in
a
paper
statement
in
the
paper
or
would
the
radio
be
favored
or
was
against
the
election
of
a
particular
candidate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
suppose
their
laws
which
would
intervene
if
they
attempted
to
appropriate
the
money
for
non-lawful
purpose
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
this
is
the
pac?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
are
not
carrying
the
question
just
one
step
further.
i
--
i
am
just
belaboring
unions
to
publish
of
paper
yet
called
labor.
as
i
understand
it,
if
that
paper
could
be
distributed
throughout
the
nation
carrying
just
exactly
the
articles
they
had
here
that
would
be
outside
the
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
you
said
if
the
labor
--
that
the
unions
own
the
paper.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
the
brotherhood.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
that
paper
that
i'm
speaking
about
is
what
might
be
called
the
voice
of
the
brotherhood.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
understand
from
you
that
they
are
not
under
the
act
under
the
other
opinion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
--
but
you
draw
a
distinction
between
the
paper
circulated
to
subscribers
and
distributing
without
being
two
subscribers,
could
it
sell
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
they
put
that
same
advertisement
in
the
new
york
times,
the
same
argument
in
the
new
york
times
or
the
washington
post,
some
of
the
other
newspapers,
they
would
be
covered
by
the
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
publish
whatever
it
is.
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
news
item
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words
all
of
the
data
papers
would
be
barred
from
putting
an
article
that
they
paid
for
in
any
other
date
of
paper
for
or
against
any
candidate.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
result
if
you
win
the
case
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
the
observation
it
became.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
continue
--
i
noticed
several
times
you've
said
espousing
the
cause
of
the
candidates
whether
that
espousing
the
cause
of
parties.
do
i
understand
thatâ€˜s
not
included
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
would
the
act
cover
commentators
over
the
radio
and
in
the
press
who
constantly
support
one
party
or
the
other
if
they
were
employed
by
a
corporation
and
paid
fees
or
paid
for
their
services?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
can
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
talking
about
the
act
and
you're
--
what
you
asked
for.
why
would
it
not
cover
every
commentator
over
the
radio
or
to
the
press
constantly
takes,
espouses
one
party
or
the
other
and
who
draws
his
pay
from
certain
corporate
interests
or
certain
labor
union
interests.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then
let's
assume
that
they
are
some
that
you
could
know
who
are
actually
electioneering
for
one
of
the
parties
night
after
night.
would
he
be
covered
if
he
was
drawing
pay
from
some
company
or
corporation
or
labor
union
to
do
what
he's
doing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
you
get
him
out?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he's
being
paid
for
his
lectures,
and
that's
where
he
does
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
it'd
be
--
it'd
be
covered,
i
suppose,
by
the
act.
i
don't
see
how
he
could
be
rid
out
of
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
does
that
--
does
that
get
pretty
close
to
raising
the
question
that
throws
the
court
to
construe
the
act
as
it
did
in
the
other
case?
does
that
raise
any
the
constitutional
question
in
your
mind?
justice
hugo
l.
black
might
be
true.
but
i
assume
that
if
there's
any
one
thing,
probably,
that
there's
pretty
general
agreement
on,
it
is
at
the
first
amendment,
at
least.
it's
designed
to
leave
it
open
for
people
whether
hired
or
not
hired
to
express
political
views
of
reference
to
the
parties
(inaudible).
and
i
would
suppose
maybe
you
are
--
this
wouldn't
--
i
--
i
don't
know
if
it
mean
it'd
have
to
reach
the
same
result
but
it
certainly
raises
the
same
problem
which
caused
the
majority
of
the
board
to
limit
the
meaning
of
the
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
undoubtedly,
whatever
it
is,
it
would
stifle
the
expression
abuse
by
commentators,
would
it
not,
who
do
express
views
on
parties
and
elections,
and
who
have
been
doing
it
through
--
through
the
years
who
were
employed
by
certain
companies
to
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
have
to
sense
to
their
remark.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they'd
have
to
stay
away
from
politics.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
couldn't
espouse
the
cause
of
a
party
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
but
how
can
you
distinguish
between
espousing
the
cause
of
a
candidate
and
espousing
the
cause
of
a
party
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
yet
covers
both,
if
it
covers
one
at
the
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
relevance
of
the
emphasis
on
the
fact
that
this
came
out
of
union
dues,
mr.
rauh?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
other
act
that
attempts
to
regulate
the
way
union
shall
spend
their
dues?
i
don't
quite
understand
the
emphasis
of
the
sound
as
a
whole
that
--
the
theory
is
that
the
unions
are
trying
to
--
members
are
trying
to
be
protective
on
how
their
dues
will
be
paid
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
statute
which
cover
--
which
has
attempted
to
regulate
the
way
the
union
shall
spend
its
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
corporation
should
buy
all
the
stock
and
the
newspaper,
would
--
how
would
the
newspaper
get
away
from
this
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you?
are
you
stating,
exempts
this
from
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
corporate
newspapers
are
exempted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
corporate
newspaper
would
have
make
a
contribution
of
money.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
why
if
they
would
be
guilty
to
making
it
(inaudible)
why
are
they
not
guilty
of
making
the
other
(inaudible)
precisely
what
you've
done
here,
would
that
be
a
contribution
or
expenditure?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
newspaper
has
published
exactly
what
you
did
at
the
expense
of
$10,000.
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
though
it's
a
corporation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
you
have
a
(inaudible)
corporate
expenditure
or
contribution
which
they
are
permitted
to
make
or
not
permitted
to
be
made
by
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
the
same
purpose.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
says
exactly
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
cannot
be
a
contribution
or
expenditure
covered
by
the
act,
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
regular
part
of
the
publication
saying
precisely
what
you
said
in
the
other
matter.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
cost
of
$10,000.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
was
an
endorsement
to
the
(inaudible),
urgency
for
the
vote.
