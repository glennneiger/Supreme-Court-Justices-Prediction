justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor,
would
you
forgive
me
if
i
ask
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
would
you
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
to
what
propositions
are
addressing
(inaudible)
or
what
propositions
you
are
rebutting
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
cause
of
action?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
make
out
a
violation
of
the
statute
disregarding
from
among
the
validity
of
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
so
that
(inaudible)
i
ask
myself.
that
doesn't
mean
that
you
have
come
to
grips
with
the
constitutionality.
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
indictment
sets
forth
(inaudible)
position
and
--
and
so
circumscribing
there's
no
question
of
constitutionality
raised.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand
that's
what
you're
--
you
were
addressing
yourself
at
the
moment
with
the
proposition
that
in
that
being
set
forth
--
i
understand
under
some
construction
of
statute,
never
mind
for
the
moment
that
it's
constitutional,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
clause
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
take
the
question
of
construction
of
the
statute,
then
it
must
come
here.
you
take
the
question
of
criminal
pleading,
then
it
has
to
come
here.
are
these
addressed
to
the
proposition
of
--
they
suggest
that
the
question
of
criminal
pleading
is
involved?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
was
--
no
question
statutory
of
construction
is
involved.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
get
that
--
to
get
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
must
repeat
my
(inaudible)
difficulties.
the
argument
that
it
should
have
gone
to
the
court
of
appeals
can
have
any
foundation,
have
a
foundation
at
all
on
a
claim
that
the
question
is
criminal
pleading
is
involved.
you
call
it
any
kind
of
construction,
the
court
construed
the
statute.
well
--
as
the
court
said,
“what
is
alleged
doesn't
make
out
any
offense
under
the
statute.
the
statute
rules
out
the
indictment
carrying
a
charge
of
an
offense
under
it
and
unless
and
otherwise
inform
that
is
a
question
of
construction,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
now
suppose
that
(inaudible)
suppose
an
indictment
was
brought
or
found
by
a
grand
jury
knew
precisely
the
same
terms
as
the
indictment
which
in
the
c.i.o.
case,
this
court
held
did
not
constitute
an
offense
under
the
statute
and
suppose
the
court
(inaudible)
suppose
the
government
wanted
to
challenge
me,
they
--
suppose
the
government
wanted
to
say,
we
want
to
take
this
up
and
ask
the
supreme
court
to
--
to
reconsider
the
decision
of
the
c.i.o.
case.
couldn't
have
to
be
brought
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
it
have
to
be
brought
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
just
the
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
(inaudible)
but
you
have
to
go
--
you
can
go
and
have
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
even
if
it's
only
that's
within
the
area
or
criminal
pleading.
and
you
have
to
come
here
directly
if
it's
within
the
area
of
statutory
construction.
now,
i
don't
want
to
take
any
more
of
your
time.
i'll
--
i'll
try
to
catch
on
with
this
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
are
not
matters
to
be
discussed
on
the
basis
of
the
indictment
or
argumentation
for
in
my
own
thinking
that
the
scope
and
content
of
the
indictment
is
as
defined
by
the
district
judge
(inaudible)
and
even
though
one
may
have
a
different
view
as
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
allegation,
i
mean,
as
a
matter
pleading.
what
the
district
court
says
the
indictment
means
on
the
basis
of
which,
if
he
says,
this
doesn't
satisfy
the
statute,
it
makes
(inaudible)
that
binding
on
this
court,
am
i
right
or
wrong
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
we
don't
have
to
go
and
independently
examine
the
indictment
would
you
have
to
(inaudible)
because
the
primary
and
almost
controlling
down
in
(inaudible)
what
the
district
judge
thought
he
was
doing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
explained
by
his
opinion
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
if
we
haven't
got
the
opinion
from
him
then
we
simply
refer
to
this
as
a
state
of
crime
then
we're
at
large.
but
if
he
does
set
forth
his
reason
then,
the
english
to
be
used
is
--
is
the
controlling
document
in
determining
what
he's
done.
is
that
a
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
state
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
--
the
question
that
you
raised
and
apparently
mr.
justice
black
is
i
think
a
very
--
this
time
(inaudible)
i
do
want
to
say
this.
that
the
criminal
appeals
then
as
far
as
i
know,
i'll
give
my
comments
for
this
court
to
review
on
the
--
on
the
legal
disposition
from
this
clause
to
be
the
elicitation
that
would
drive
(inaudible)
i
--
i
myself
is
clear
that
(inaudible)
but
there
are
elements
here
and
potentiality
in
regards
to
it
that
make
it
awfully
close
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
there
maybe
no
conviction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor,
may
i
get
the
position
of
the
government
(inaudible)
unless
they're
deferred
incorrectly
that
under
the
c.i.o.
decision,
the
c.i.o.
lose
(inaudible)
regularly
published
week
in,
week
out
in
partaking,
recommending
some
candidates
an
opposing
elements
would
be
outside
of
the
statute,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
a
radio
station
owned
and
conducted
by
look
forward
to
the
same
--
the
unit
of
the
same
non-prohibition,
could
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you.
now,
instead
of
having
it
on
stages
suppose
it
hired
a
commentator
as
it
does
in
actually
to
deny
that
the
c.i.o.
(inaudible)
that
the
commentator,
it
is
(inaudible)
would
that
be
still
outside
the
statute?
that's
why
we're
not
to
ask
these
question
but
you
have
a
--
you're
not
to
accept
this
case
limitation
under
which
we
are
and
i'm
not
passing
unconstitutional
questions
for
the
cooperative
station.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
want
to
be
(inaudible).
so
--
now
let
me
go
in
from
there.
to
compare
its
own
pages
a
regular
proposition
but
full-page
ads
and
all
of
these
citizens
--
cities
were
on
campaign
ballots
paid
for
by
c.i.o.
(inaudible)
is
this
case.
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
need
to
generalize
that
we
need
to
--
we
should
have
fair
standard
and
so
on
but
on
the
whole,
a,
b,
and
c
by
their
votes
have
been
claiming
the
cause
labor
and
x
y
z
as
an
enemy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
be
condemned
at
this
case,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
statute
said
you
can't
make
those
mistakes.
am
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
the
indictment
might.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
statute
wouldn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
distinction
is,
as
i
gather,
between
dissemination
of
use
and
the
recommendation
or
that
these
are
forbidden
by
a
labor
union
or
a
corporation
and
as
i
have
to
separate
the
two,
as
part
of
systematic
conduct
of
its
business
throughout
the
year
and
begins
utilizing
outside
agencies,
supported
by
it
to
express
its
position
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
candidates.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
its
--
even
its
general
fund
we
get
the
same
unit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
for
passing
on
the
fund
to
the
time
they
can
have
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
labor
is
not
the
brotherhood
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
half
of
that
decision
is
a
decision
of
c.i.o.
case,
half
of
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it?
that
a
publication
by
the
--
the
newspaper
of
the
union,
would
be
part
of
the
union
anyway.
i
don't
think,
or
am
i
wrong?
i
don't
think
the
c.i.o.
case
(inaudible)
i
don't
think
there
was
special
subscriptions
for
the
particular
publication,
was
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
out
of
general
funds?
that's
what
i
thought.
so
that
a
publication
by
the
union
as
part
of
its
conduct
as
a
union
for
the
purpose
of
informing
its
(inaudible)
the
c.i.o.
case
said
that's
not
within
the
terms
of
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
your
answer
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
close
--
that's
our
position,
too.
that's
why
i
say
(inaudible)
publishing
only
outside
not
a
standing
vehicle
of
informing
its
members,
not
a
means
of
educating
its
members
when
in
fact
the
public
hasn't
overruled
brought
on
explicit,
directed,
purposeful
utilization
of
another
vehicle
of
publication
to
press
its
political
views
the
more
exquisitely
in
favoring
against
some
candidates.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
do
that,
would
you
go
on
to
the
next
paragraph
of
your
consent
as
what
the
paragraph
has
declared
and
the
court
goes
on
to
say
what
then
did
congress
intend
by
expenditures
and
it
then
said,
“it
didn't
mean
that.”
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is,
isn't
--
isn't
the
case
here
on
what
the
indictment
said
is
construed
by
judge
picard
and
his
construction
that
that
did
not
constitute
an
expenditure.
that
supposed
case
properly
here
and
only
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
--
i
can't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
still
can't
see
the
conflict.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
stupid.
i
--
to
bring
other
folks
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
good
speech
you're
making
to
the
jury.
but
i
should
think
is
if
anybody
said
--
speaking
to
myself.
“i
want
mr.
jones
to
be
elected
as
senator”,
and
mr.
jones
(inaudible)
talking
also
on
behalf
of
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
a
complicated
question
in
prime
that
you
can't
--
that
there
cannot
be
two
purposes
and
two
target
--
targets
at
the
same
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rauh,
that
is
interested
education
or
do
you
want
mr.
jones
elected
and
mrs.
smith
defeated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
's
all
consequences
from
that
but
the
fact
is
you're
making
a
speech
on
your
behalf,
on
behalf
of
mr.
jones
becoming
further
your
cause.
and
you're
trying
to
split
at
two
motives
as
those
two
motifs
didn't
exist
and
only
one
existed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
take
a
minute
mr.
rauh
and
state
what
you
concede
to
be
the
difference
in
view
of
the
solicitor
general
as
to
the
charge
of
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
you
leave
out
what
the
c.i.o.
case
this
time
and
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
is
it
--
why
--
i'm
puzzled
by
the
pertinency
as
to
which
both
of
you
discloses
the
indictment.
i
suppose
you
can
agree
on
this,
in
neither
case,
if
the
c.i.o.,
the
other
one
was
--
in
neither
case,
the
c.i.o.
case
in
the
overview
with
this
expressed
view
of
the
union
about
existentialism
or
the
situation
in
the
contrary.
in
each
case
they
said,
“it
is
to
our
interest
to
promote
the
election
of
smith”
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
now,
why
all
this
fuss?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
think
that's
precisely
my
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
from
the
content
of
the
indictment
which
to
me
in
both
cases
did
a
vote
of
the
union
to
say
it
is
to
their
interest
that
smith
should
be
elected.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
accept
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
can
go
on
and
talk
about
the
significance
in
the
means
by
which
that
was
enforced.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
have
to
--
you
don't
need
senator
taft's
statement
to
reach
that
conclusion.
if
you
just
read
the
statute,
any
labor
organization
to
make
a
contribution.
if
you're
just
a
(inaudible)
of
other
people's
money
then
you're
not
taking
the
contribution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rauh,
suppose
the
--
assume
that
the
united
mine
workers
had
done
in
the
last
campaign
firstly,
what
they've
refuted
to
have
done
in
the
1936
campaign.
could
that
be
within
or
without
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
was
it
--
why
was
–
why
is
it
a
clear
violation?
why
did
you
let
the
action
speak
louder
than
words?
the
action
speaks
of
words
by
the
manifestation
of
their
views?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
is
it
a
violation
of
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
doesn't
--
the
statute
doesn't
say
anything
about
speech
or
how
they
can
contribute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
$300,000
to
$600,000
just
on
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
kind
of
speech.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rauh,
one
aspect
and
i
don't
--
and
i'm
taking
your
time
on
consideration
that
bring
me
short
of
a
constitutional
question,
do
not
(inaudible),
i
am.
i'd
like
to
put
this
to
you
because
it
bothers
me
though
i
suspect
there's
nothing
to
it
because
no
--
it
doesn't
bother
anybody
else
in
the
printed
opinion.
the
statute
says
“in
connection
with”
and
on
the
proposition
to
which
you're
addressing
yourself,
giving
a
construction
to
which
put
you
this
side
of
the
constitutional
problem.
i
do
not
find
it
difficult
as
a
matter
of
inquiry,
as
a
matter
of
judicial
interest.
the
reading
connection
with
as
especially
relating
to
and
therefore
differentiate
between
an
intervention
for
an
added
time
pay
and
having
a
continuous
organ
which
addresses
the
position
of
labor
and
in
connection
with
that
when
election
times
comes
around,
speaking
to
that
subject
as
during
the
rest
of
the
years
they
talk
about
other
subjects.
in
other
words,
i
do
not
know
why
in
connect
with
that
have
been
sliding
in
the
discussion
of
the
meaning
of
the
--
of
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
it's
narrower,
not
broadened.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or,
is
that
the
way
you
look
at
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rauh,
you
made
a
distinction
between
the
divisions
of
the
statute,
limiting
the
conduct
of
the
corporation
within
the
organization.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
these
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
the
question
was
of
the
freedom
of
speech
consideration
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
do
that,
mr.
rauh,
a
little
while
ago,
a
few
minutes
ago,
you
said,
you
indicated
without
explaining
at
least
to
my
ears,
that
on
the
second
circumstance,
the
case
would
have
to
be
returned
to
the
district
court.
you
said,
“or
to
the
court
of
appeals,”
now,
what
--
under
what
circumstances
we
have
to
certify
this
case
to
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
on
the
question
--
whether
or
not
there
was
bearings
in
their
argument
would
very
extend
a
rather
--
dwell
upon
a
restriction,
technical
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
a
new
way
of
--
in
using
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
the
economic
--
i
suppose
you
don't
because
you
have
a
hard
time
differentiating
between
the
right
of
a
corporation
to
urge
the
economic
interest
which
binds
those
disparate
members
together.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
put
a
limit
as
to
the
amount
of
expenditures?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
--
but
i
understand
the
opinion
that
the
government
calls
at
issue.
the
government
