going
back
to
your
--
call
it
with
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
is
what
you
are
saying
in
effect
that
if
this
indictment
does
not
state
a
crime
under
the
statute,
then
you
can't
draw
an
indictment
it
doesn't
make
the
stated
crime
under
the
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
what
you
are
really
saying
is
that
without
reaching
the
constitutional
point,
the
effect
of
this
decision
is
to
strike
down
the
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
your
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
suggestion
is
not
involved
merely
sending
it
back
to
the
lower
court
to
reach
the
question
of
the
demurrer
that
it
failed
to
reach
but
to
send
it
back
with
instructions
would
be
--
indictment
states
an
offense
under
the
statute
reserving
the
constitutional
question
after
the
--
until
after
there
has
been
a
trial
and
a
conviction.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
then
they
never
had
to
reach
(voice

justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
the
situation
of
the
c.i.o.
case
and
in
the
painters
case
are
both
outside
the
statute,
do
you
state
a
hypothetical
kind
of
a
situation
that
you
think
would
be
within
the
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
of
course
the
way
the
case
comes
to
us,
we
really
don't
know
what
was
said,
do
we?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
then,
what
is
fundamental
is
really
basic
to
your
position,
isn't
it
that
that
we
have
to
read
the
indictment
as
you
say
the
district
court
construed
it?
if
that
position
of
yours
is
rejected,
then
certainly
the
holding
is
broad
enough
to
encompass
a
lot
of
these
borderline
questions
which
even
you
would
recognize
as
being
possibly
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
borderline
questions
and
we
really
would
be
justified
would
we
in
--
in
saying
that
the
indictment
is
not
charged
of
crime
under
the
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
on
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
say
that
the
statute
is
also
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
a
business
corporation?
