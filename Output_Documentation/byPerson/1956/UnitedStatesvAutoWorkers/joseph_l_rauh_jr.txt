mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
three
different
issues
as
we
see
it.
first,
what
did
the
district
court
say
the
indictment
meant?
second,
on
the
district
court's
construction
of
the
indictment,
was
there
an
expenditure
within
the
meaning
of
section
610?
and
thirdly,
if
there
was
an
expenditure
within
the
meaning
or
610,
was
that
a
violation
of
the
constitution
to
so
charges?
as
far
as
the
district
court's
interpretation,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
he
did
make
an
interpretation
of
the
indictment
and
that
this
court
is
bound
by
it.
on
page
43
of
the
record,
the
district
court
says
as
follows;
“according
to
the
authorities,
the
union
was
not
making
an
expenditure
on
behalf
of
a
political
candidate.
it
desired
to
inform
its
members
and
others
of
the
position
of
the
union
on
those
seeking
certain
federal
offices.”
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
was
reading
from
page
43,
sir.
the
point
of
this
is
that,
of
course,
we
were
engaged
in
political
advocacy
in
stating
our
position
but
that
it
was
our
position
as
a
union
which
we
were
stating.
and
now,
the
government
is
trying
to
make
it
appear
as
though
we
were
making
a
contribution
direct
or
indirect
to
the
campaign
of
the
particular
candidate
and
the
relevant
distinction
between
what
the
district
court
said
below.
and
what
the
government
is
urging
here
is
between
a
union
stating
its
position
for
everyone
to
hear,
and
we're
proud
of
our
position,
and
a
union
simply
doing
what
the
candidate
wants,
namely,
sloganeering
for
him,
repeating
his
statements,
being
an
arm
of
his
campaign.
but
what
the
district
court
did
limit
here,
what
the
district
court
did
say
is
that
this
indictment
charges
only
that
the
union,
clearly
electioneering,
clearly
stating
its
views,
clearly
political
advocacy,
but
clearly
stating
its
own
views.
and
that's
what
it
meant,
sir,
on
page
43
when
it
used
the
words
“on
behalf.”
the
government
tries
to
read
this
paragraph
as
though
it
didn't
operate
as
an
interpretation
but
it
was
the
very
interpretation
that
we
were
making
of
the
indictment
and
that
the
government
was
not
objecting
to.
it
was
--
the
union
was
not
making
an
expenditure
on
behalf
of
a
political
candidate.
it
was
not
saying
a
slogan
for
the
candidate.
it
was
stating
its
own
position.
now,
in
the
limited
few
moments
what
or
i
would
like
to
summarize
what
this
means
and
why
this
completely
refutes
the
position
of
the
government.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
precisely.
i
--
that's
the
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
precisely,
your
honor.
the
case
of
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
the
argument
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
the
argument
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
the
argument
between
the
government
and
the
union
over
the
construction
of
the
indictment
is,
that
the
government
contends
that
the
indictment
would
permit
proof
that
all
we
were
doing
was
parroting
a
slogan
for
the
candidate
or
that
it
would
permit
proof
we
were
trying
to
make
a
contribution
to
the
candidate
through
our
activity.
we
say
the
indictment
as
construed
by
the
district
judge
permits
only
a
proof
that
we
were
engaged
in
political
advocacy
of
the
type
involved
in
the
c.i.o.
case.
in
other
words,
the
government
tried
to
distinguish
the
c.i.o.
case
in
the
lower
court
on
the
ground
that
it
was
a
difference
between
a
house
organ
and
a
commercial
telecast.
here,
they
say
there
is
a
difference
in
content
between
the
political
expression
in
the
c.i.o.
case
and
the
political
expression
they
can
prove
here
and
a
different
in
--
difference
in
intent
between
the
intent
to
express
a
political
view
and
the
intent
to
make
a
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
contribution
and
we
say,
if
i
may
just
raise
--
in
my
short
time,
that
we
say
that
they
cannot
here
restate
the
indictment
over
the
interpretation.
but
we
both
agree,
and
that
was
i
wanted
to
conclude
on
in
this
--
this
afternoon.
we
both
agree
that
this
court
can
decide
the
question
of
whether
the
indictment,
so
interpreted,
falls
within
the
statute.
we
do
not
take
the
position
that
this
court
is
faced
with
a
constitutional
issue.
we
believe
that
interpreted
to
avoid
that
constitutional
issue.
to
exclude
a
union
taking
its
own
position
is
certainly
the
proper
interpretation
of
this
statute
and
it
leaves
plenty
left
for
the
statute
to
do.
the
statute
still
would
apply
to
efforts
by
a
union
to
become
a
part
of
the
campaign
of
a
particular
candidate
and
would
leave
many
efforts
of
speech
that
might
be
taken
apart
from
this
particular
one,
we
say,
and
has
the
right
to
do
and
all
apart
from
speech.
there
are
many
expenditures
that
would
be
barred.
the
interpretation
that
judge
picard
gave
does
not,
on
his
statement,
that
it's
our
position
we
may
give,
our
advocacy
we
may
give,
does
not
limit
the
statute
in
such
a
way
as
to
a
emasculate
it.
and
it
is
on
this
phases,
on
the
fact
that
the
statute
--
that
the
indictment
charges
a
union
out
of
union
dues
was
stating
its
own
position
is
--
it
--
it
would
raise
for
this
court
a
constitutional
issue
of
the
gravest
part.
it
would
mean
that
this
court
was
saying
were
it
to
uphold
this
action,
it
would
mean
in
affect
of
saying
that
where
a
union,
where
real
political
advocacy
may
actually
have
influence
that
is
not
protected
by
the
constitution
even
though
extremest
views
which
may
never
have
influenced
will
be
protected.
we
ask
for
the
right
here.
we
do
not
believe
the
statute
bars
it
as
interpreted
by
the
district
court.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
on
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
on
the
contrary
sir
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
sir,
when
our
union
states
its
position,
we
may
or
may
not
be
helping
the
candidate.
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
when
mr.
ruther
comes
out
for
a
candidate
in
mississippi,
he
is
stating
the
position
of
the
union
without
reference
to
the
act
that
may
be
taken
by
the
voters.
when
we
state
our
position,
we
may
or
may
not
be
helping
a
particular
candidate
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
but
we
will
be
educating
the
public
to
the
issues.
and
we
will
in
fact
be
making
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
we
want
him
elected
but
we
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
the
indictment
in
this
case
can
be
stated
in
a
single
sentence,
just
one
sentence
that
the
united
automobile
workers
used
union
dues
to
pay
for
television
broadcasts
which
urged
and
endorsed
the
election
of
certain
senators
and
congressmen
in
which
it
included
expressions
of
political
advocacy
intended
to
influence
the
public.
that
is
the
entire
indictment.
the
union
asked
for
no
bill
of
particulars
because
it
read
the
indictment
to
charge
no
more
than
the
use
of
union
dues
to
pay
for
television
broadcasts
and
to
make
the
union's
position
on
federal
candidates
known
to
its
members
and
the
general
public.
in
other
words,
if
your
honors
please,
we
read
the
indictment
as
charging
a
c.i.o.
case
type
statement
of
union
position
over
a
different
media
of
communication
and
we
deemed
the
case
as
we
thought
the
government
did
a
proper
vehicle
for
settling
the
question
whether
a
commercial
telecast
would
be
treated
differently
from
a
statement
in
a
house
organ
the
contents
of
the
communication
being
similar.
we
move
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
that
the
indictment
so
interpreted
did
not
charge
in
expenditure
within
the
meaning
of
section
610
and
if
it
did
was
unconstitutional.
i
believe
the
solicitor
general
inadvertently
left
out
the
fact
that
we
had
moved
on
statutory
construction
as
well
as
on
constitutional
grounds.
i
only
refer
to
it
because
it
does
differentiate
our
action
in
this
respect
to
that
of
the
defendant
in
the
c.i.o.
case
some
years
past.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
sir.
we
say
that
the
charge
and
we
believe
the
judge
said
that
the
charge
is
a
c.i.o.
type
statement
going
out
over
a
commercial
television
station.
the
government
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
i
meant
by
--
sir,
i
meant
that
it
was
the
type
of
editorial
that
the
content
of
the
communication
was
similar
to
that
in
c.i.o.
and
that
we
are
charged
with
taking
that
type
of
communication
and
putting
it
over
a
commercial
television
station.
that's
what
we
conceive
the
indictment
to
be.
the
solicitor
general
i
believe
conceives
the
indictment
to
be
that
allows
him
to
prove
in
addition
to
what
we
say
it
is
in
the
indictment
two
other
things.
first,
a
different
in
content
which
would
include
i
suppose
such
things
is
simply
saying
both
corrects
or
simply
parading
the
candidate's
words.
he
could
prove
they
say
a
difference
in
content
and
a
difference
in
the
intent.
in
other
words,
they
claimed
the
right
to
prove
that
we
intended
to
make
a
contribution.
now,
what
we
say
and
what
i
believe
they
said
in
the
court
below
and
we
have
filed
it,
sir
with
the
clerk
our
briefs
below
too,
so
that
they
are
available
to
the
court
and
the
references
are
in
our
briefs.
we
contend
that
below
the
government
said
to
judge
picard,
“distinguish
the
c.i.o.
case
on
the
ground
that
there's
a
difference
between
a
commercial
television
broadcast
and
a
house
organ.”
they
never
suggested
these
differences
of
content
of
the
statement
that
was
to
go
out
nor
did
they
suggest
any
difference
of
intent
over
the
--
to
make
a
contribution
and
indeed
i
would
point
out
that
the
indictment
contains
no
reference
to
such
an
intent
and
the
representative
of
the
government
in
the
court
below
made
clear
that
they
were
not
charging
a
contribution.
that
appears,
if
your
honors
please,
on
page
24
of
the
record
about
15
to
20
lines
up
of
the
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
right.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
right.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
i
could
only
say
that
this
fuss
is
apparently
that
we
feel
and
sir
if
i
may,
i
make
this
point
clear
that
i
am
not
now
arguing
the
significance
of
the
difference.
i
was
trying
to
explain
the
difference
and
then
i
got
ahead
of
myself
yesterday
in
arguing
the
significance
of
the
difference.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
would
like
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
precisely.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
--
without
reservation.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
just
to
bring
--
i
want
to
do
that.
just
to
bring
the
point
to
conclusion
if
i
may.
the
--
we
say
and
i
don't
want
to
interpret
the
solicitor
general
anymore
than
--
than
that
as
to
reopen
it.
we
say
that
the
indictment
charges,
the
same
type
or
both
for
mr.
smith
that
it
--
what
occurred
in
this
--
in
the
c.i.o.
case
and
the
charges
we
did
it
over
a
commercial
television
station.
now,
that
is
the
case
as
we
see
it.
we
say
that
that's
what
the
indictment
charges.
that's
what
the
district
court
said
it
held
and
that
is
exactly
what
is
before
your
honors
here.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
it
--
sir,
if
it
came
out
of
voluntary
funds,
then
everyone
agrees
that
it
is
not
a
violation.
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
says
that.
just
--
for
example,
take
cope,
that's
a
committee
on
political
action
--
on
political
education
of
the
afl
or
c.i.o.
they
get
voluntary
funds
paid
separately
from
union
dues
from
a
number
of
members.
everybody
agrees
that
an
expenditure
by
cope
or
a
contribution
by
cope
is
legal.
now,
the
reason
everybody
agrees
that
is
--
i
think
the
government
is
under
some
misunderstanding
about
the
statute
on
this
point
but
we
agree
as
to
the
result.
they
think
the
statute
doesn't
apply
because
cope
is
not
a
labor
organization.
my
judgment,
cope
is
clearly
a
labor
organization
under
the
statute
but
it
doesn't
apply,
if
your
honor
please,
because
senator
taft
made
clear
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
that
voluntary
funds
not
part
of
dues
could
be
used
for
any
purpose
and
whether
you
--
whether
you
use
the
government's
interpretation
or
ours,
the
fact
is
that
there's
never
been
an
indictment
for
voluntary
moneys
and
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that
would
be
another
interpretation
to
reach
the
same
answer.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
the
government
is
contending,
sir
that
that
is
the
justification
for
the
statute
that
it's
a
protection
of
the
minority
members
of
the
union.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no.
and
as
i
would
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
say
that
when
we
come
to
--
as
of
--
when
i
come
to
this
point,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
statute
is
not
directed
at
the
minority
but
of
taking
unions
out
of
politics.
now,
sir,
gentlemen,
on
the
question
of
the
statutory
construction
of
the
indictment
as
we
interpret
it,
we
firmly
believe
that
this
court
should
affirm
the
decision
below
because
this
case
is
governed
by
the
c.i.o.
decision.
there,
mr.
murray
then
president
of
the
c.i.o.
in
an
editorial
which
accused
mr.
garmatz's
opponent
to
the
union's
support
of
being
a
notorious
anti-labor
(inaudible)
and
the
like,
this
court
despite
that
clear
political
advocacy
held
that
statement
outside
the
statute
because
of
the
gravest
constitutional
doubts
that
would
be
raised
if
in
fact
that
were
included.
and
the
following
year,
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
painters
local
on
a
case
which
the
judge
--
court
below
and
we
submit
is
on
all
fours
with
this
case
held
that
the
expenditures
were
not
within
the
statute.
there,
a
local
union
advertising
a
newspaper
and
over
a
radio
as
follows.
we
want
senator
taft
defeated
for
president.
we
want
all
the
republican
congressmen
defeated
in
the
coming
congressional
elections.
it
was
a
clear
electioneering.
it
was
paid
broadcast
and
paid
newspaper
advertising
and
it
is
in
all
fours
with
this
case.
the
learned
solicitor
general
suggested
yesterday
that
the
second
circuit
treated
the
case
as
being
controlled
by
the
facts.
i
must
most
respectfully
disagree
the
court
or
augustus
hand,
clark
and
frank
said,
“it
is
impossible
on
principle
to
differentiate
between
the
c.i.o.
decision
and
the
facts
before
us.
indeed,
the
court
went
on
to
make
perfectly
clear
they
were
making
a
decision
on
principle.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
at
page
36,
the
court
said
that
any
distinction
between
the
c.i.o.
case
and
an
independent
newspaper
or
radio
station
and
i
quote
from
judge
hand's
opinion,
“it
seems
without
logical
justification
nor
such
a
differentiation
suggested
by
the
apparent
purposes
or
by
the
terms
of
the
statute
or
by
the
legislative
history.”
now,
the
government
accepted
this
for
six
years.
for
six
years
after
the
c.i.o.
and
painters
local
case,
there
were
no
indictments
for
following
the
painters
local
case.
and
if
i
may
call
your
honors'
attention
to
the
fact
that
last
may,
the
assistant
attorney
general
and
whose
jurisdiction
of
this
case
falls
and
months
before
this
indictment
was
brought
told
a
committee
investigating
this
problem,
they,
the
supreme
court
expressed
so
many
doubts
about
it
referring
to
the
statute,
all
of
them
did,
that
it
made
it
about
impossible
certainly
impractical
to
prosecute
under
the
statute.
in
other
words,
for
six
years
it
was
government
policy
to
interpret
the
painters
local
case
exactly
as
we
interpret
it
today.
for
six
years,
it
was
government
policy
to
treat
the
c.i.o.
case
as
applicable
to
statements
over
in
the
newspapers,
purchase
statements
and
the
purchase
statements
in
radios.
and
it
is
only
today,
sometime
later
that
the
government
has
changed
its
interpretation
of
the
c.i.o.
case
and
of
the
painters
local
case.
i
would
suggest
if
your
honors
please
that
on
page
6
of
the
government's
reply
brief,
there
is
a
suggestion
that
they
did
not
prosecute
during
this
period
because
there
was
a
wide
area
where
unions
may
and
do
operate
without
contravening
the
statute.
this
statement
appears
at
the
end
--
towards
the
end
of
footnote
3
of
the
government's
reply
brief.
this
in
answer
to
our
contention
that
for
six
years
we
have
been
allowed
this
latitude
of
the
painters
local
and
the
government
says,
“oh
no,
we
were
only
allowing
you
a
wide
area
where
unions
may
and
do
operate
without
contravening
the
statute.”
what
they
are
saying
there
is
that
they
were
allowing
us
to
spend
voluntary
money.that
is
not
the
situation.
for
six
years,
unions
continued
to
rely
upon
painters
local
and
only
now
for
reasons
not
disclosed
was
there
a
change
in
governmental
policy
to
take
painters
local
out
of
the
situation
and
say
that
the
c.i.o.
case
has
a
different
meaning
than
the
three
distinguished
judges
in
painters
local
held
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
sir.
as
the
court
in
the
c.i.o.
case
said,
the
statute
was
--
the
word
“expenditures”
was
intended
to
eradicate
the
--
the
doubt
that
had
been
raised
as
to
the
reach
of
the
word
“contribution”
not
to
extend
greatly
the
coverage
of
the
section.
and
i
would
say
that
an
expenditure
for
example
take
a
union
man,
a
union
employee
and
put
him
in
the
headquarters
of
the
--
of
the
candidate.
give
him
--
give
the
--
give
the
candidate
some
facilities
that
you
have
available.
give
him
off
a
space,
things
that
don't
seem
to
be
exactly
a
contribution
as
senator
taft
said,
“i
think
the
contribution
means
more
than
some
people
think,
but
we're
putting
--
we're
--
we're
putting
expenditure
in
not
greatly.”
as
this
court
said
not
greatly
to
extend
contribution
but
to
give,
make
it
clear
that
you
can't
have
these
indirect
contributions
and
i
say
that
if
you
--
if
the
union
wants
to
put
its
people
to
work
for
the
candidate,
that's
an
indirect
contribution
or
an
expenditure,
facilities
would
be.
now,
i
would
go
farther
and
say
that
there
are
borderline
cases
where
speech
might
be.
this
is
not
before
the
court
and
this
maybe
what
i've
been
trying
to
say
so
unsuccessfully.
there
were
borderline
cases
of
speech
which
are
not
involved
in
this
indictment
which
this
court
may
have
to
decide
someday,
where
one
could
argue
that
it's
an
indirect
contribution
and
therefore
an
expenditure
was
in
the
meaning
here
and
still,
speech
for
example.
i
would
say
if
we
did
nothing
but
put
on
vote
for
x,
that
might
be
treated
as
an
indirect
contribution.
i
would
say
if
we
paid
for
the
candidate's
broadcast
that
would
be
an
indirect
contribution.
now,
whether
we're
part
from
doing
that
under
the
constitution
remains
to
be
seen.
i
only
say
that
case
is
not
here.
what
is
here
is
the
expression
of
views
of
the
type
of
the
c.i.o.
case
expression
of
views
and
that
this
clearly
is
outside
the
statute
and
that
there
are
plenty
of
things
left
to
give
meaning
to
the
word
expenditures
even
things
which
are
within
the
realm
of
speech
where
this
court
may
someday
be
faced
with
the
problem
but
where
it
is
not
faced
today.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
that's
a
clear
violation
of
law,
sir.
that
was
a
contribution.
we
do
not
here
contend
that
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
to
make
it
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
the
statute,
sir
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
but
it
--
see,
the
question
of
speech
is
relevant
to
giving
the
statute
a
narrow
construction
so
that
questions
of
constitutionality
as
to
speech
will
be
avoided.
now,
one
might
argue
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
one
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
one
might
argue
and
someday
i
may
be
here
arguing
that
a
contribution
is
protected
because
of
the
very
reason
you
gave.
i
only
am
suggesting
in
answer
to
justice
harlan's
question
that
there
are
other
expenditures
which
will
still
be
under
the
act
even
if
you
take
the
expenditures
for
which
i
am
arguing
out
from
under
the
act.
whether
a
contribution
would
not
be
allowed
--
whether
prohibiting
a
constitution
may
not
someday
be
held
to
be
a
violation
of
the
constitution,
i
do
not
know.
this
court
does
not
have
to
go
nearly
that
far
here.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that's
a
very
close
--
that's
the
borderline
case,
sir
that
i
say
is
not
here.
in
my
judgment,
free
speech
protects
it.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
but
i
say
that
--
that
of
my
view
--
what
i
really
was
trying
to
--
why
i
spend
so
much
time
on
the
position
was
that
i
was
trying
to
--
to
really
show
that
this
case
is
much
narrower.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
hope
someday
to
be
here
defending
the
right
to
do
that.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
sir,
it
is
an
--
sir,
the
only
way
you
can
limit
the
statute
is
based
upon
the
speech
argument.
this
--
the
word
is
expenditures.
the
word
is
broad
therefore
it
becomes
a
matter
of
limiting
it
to
avoid
the
constitutional
issue.
i
would
say
that
we
would
contend
that
that
act
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment
and
you
--
the
court
will
be
faced
either
with
so
ruling
or
limiting
the
statute
to
avoid
deciding
that.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
we
are
sir,
relying
on
the
free
speech
argument
but
we
say
that
it
is
much
clear
when
you
are
stating
your
own
position
that
when
you
are
making
what
come
so
close
to
a
--
a
contribution
as
just
to
put
up
a
poster
with
the
picture
of
the
candidate
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
when
that
case
comes,
your
honor,
we
will
say
that
it
is
not
an
expenditure
because
the
statute
should
be
limited
to
avoid
the
constitutional
doubts
that
would
be
involved
if
it
wasn't
and
that
if
it
isn't
so
limited,
it
will
--
it's
unconstitutional.
i
only
say
that
case
is
not
presently
before
you.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no.
i
say
there
is
a
difference
and
the
difference
is
that
in
the
paid
telecast,
we
gave
a
reason
in
defense
of
our
position.
we
were
advocating
a
position.
this
other
--
if
you
want
to
treat
it
as
advocacy
of
a
position,
it's
the
same.
some
other
parts
including
the
government
say,
"that's
really
an
indirect
contribution.
it's
the
same
as
if
you're
given
the
billboard
space
to
the
man
himself."
now,
i
would
say
that
it
is
not
the
same,
but
i
would
say
it
is
different,
from
a
15-minute
or
half
hour
telecast
in
which
you
make
a
speech
for
a
candidate
simply
to
say
the
conclusion
vote
for
x.
we
would
argue
that
the
latter
was
protected,
but
we
do
not
have
to
maintain
that
position
in
order
to
maintain
our
position
here.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
think
that's
right,
sir.
if
i
--
it
may
sound
somewhat
strange,
but
the
fact
is
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that
the
more
you
say,
the
more
you
are
injecting
your
own
position
into
the
matter
and
the
less
you
are
simply
trying
to
--
to
give
a
conclusion
the
--
the
less
it
seems
to
be
an
indirect
contribution.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
we
have
now
--
we
have
not
felt
that
it
broadened
the
statute
and
the
government
as
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
maybe
i
have
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
all
right,
sir,
i
--
i
can
agree
with
--
with
that.
i
say
for
four
reasons
this
is
governed
by
c.i.o.
the
literal
language
is
equally
applicable.
it's
a
--
there
is
no
difference.
money
was
paid
out.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
felt
there
might
be
a
difference,
if
your
honor
please,
and
it
was
for
that
reason
that
i
was
suggesting
we
had
a
more
protected
area
of
activity
that
there
is
a
difference
between
a
contribution
in
which
you
are
handing
over
money
and
then
he
can
then
use
it
in
anyway
he
wants.
and
then
there
is
the
corrupting
influence
that's
involved
in
giving
money
to
someone.
and
yourself
going
out
and
saying
what
you
believe
and
without
any
corrupting
influence,
can
they
--
may
very
well
not
like
what
you're
saying
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
very
often
in
a
community.
the
union
will
be
saying
something
for
the
candidate
that
the
candidate
himself
might
not
have
chosen
to
make
it
and
you
have
seen
it
in
many
areas
in
the
last
years
where
unions
have
been
campaigning
on
certain
issues
that
the
candidate
himself
was
so
friendly.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
oh,
no.
there
is
no
such
charge.
we
are
on
a
television
broadcast
but
it
is
that
the
union
was
on
the
television
broadcast
that
it's
only
that
there
was
an
intermediate
agent
here
who
--
an
agent
--
we
always
have
an
agent
to
hire
you
a
hall
or
to
hire
you
a
television
program,
he
gets
a
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that's
correct.
they
--
we
gave
them
the
money
and
they
gave
it
to
the
television
station
and
we
spoke
over
the
television
station.
there
is
no
suggestion
that
--
that
these
people
spoke
over
the
television
station.
i'm
sure
that
there's
never
been
the
slightest
suggestion
of
that.
i
can
assure
you
that
they
did
not,
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
sir.
what
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
as
being
borderline
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
believe
that
if
you
--
if
that
came,
then
you
would
be
reversing
an
interpretation.
it
would
have
to
send
it
back
or
send
it
to
the
court
of
appeals.
i
quite
agree
that
--
that
you'll
have
--
you'll
--
that
we
--
we
would
be
--
we
are
now
predicating
the
request
for
an
affirmance
on
the
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
on
the
interpretation.
what
you
would
do
afterwards
if
these
were
incorrect.
i'd
like
to
come
to
--
may
i
just
--
i'd
like
to
just
state
the
four
--
i'd
--
the
four
reasons
why
this
case
is
identical
with
c.i.o.
the
literal
language
is
identical.
the
legislative
history
is
identical
indeed.
if
there's
one
thing
that
the
legislative
history
makes
clear,
it
is
that
you
cannot
distinguish
between
a
house
organ
and
commercial
broadcast.
the
great
constitutional
doubts
that
would
be
raised
are
equally
applicable
and
there
is
a
fourth
reason
which
is
the
most
important
of
all.
if
this
court
makes
the
distinction
between
our
talking
to
ourselves
and
our
talking
to
the
public,
this
court
will
be
setting
up
labor
as
an
enclave
in
american
life
where
it
has
never
been.
congress
didn't
suggest
that
we
be
allowed
to
communicate
freely
with
our
own
members
and
try
to
build
them
into
a
labor
unit,
into
some
sort
of
a
pressure
operation
on
political
life.
it
would
be
this
court's
distinction,
never
suggested
by
congress
that
would
occasion
that.
in
other
words,
every
reason
of
policy
which
has
been
that
labor
becomes
a
part
of
the
community,
every
effort
by
the
uaw
which
has
been
in
the
forefront
of
this
to
make
a
proposition
of
community
first
labor
into
a
second
goes
by
the
boards.
you
would
be
encouraging
contrary
that
it
seems
to
me,
every
policy
of
american
life.
you
would
be
encouraging
us
just
to
work
inside
of
labor
and
just
to
build
it
as
a
political
movement.
what
we
are
asking
for
here
is
simply
to
have
the
right
to
say
the
same
things
outside
of
the
labor
movement
that
we
have
been
given
the
right
by
the
c.i.o.
case
to
stay
inside.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
we
believe
that
under
many
circumstances,
the
corporation
would
be
the
same.
we
--
there
are
legal
differences.
there
are
illegal
differences.
there
are
factual
differences
but
we
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
we
see
no
reason
why
a
corporation
should
not
state
its
views
to
the
public
on
political
issues.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
sir.
there
are
--
one
might
draw
a
distinction.
we
are
not
urging
such
a
distinction.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
sir,
under
--
under
the
government's
interpretation,
they
could
not.
under
ours,
our
--
our
interpretation
makes
everybody
equal.
the
newspaper
is
stating
its
views.
the
corporation
is
stating
its
views
and
the
union
is
stating
its
views.
now,
what
does
the
government
say
about
the
difference
between
this
and
c.i.o.?
the
government
refers
to
literal
language,
but
it's
the
same
as
it
refers
to
legislative
history,
but
it's
the
same
--
but
it's
even
clear
that
they
intend
no
such
extension.
it
says
that
we
are
emasculating
the
statute
but
it's
my
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan,
there
is
plenty
left.
and
finally,
and
this
is
really
at
the
crux
of
the
case.
the
government
says
at
page
17
of
their
brief,
at
the
bottom
of
page
17
that
what
we
are
doing
differs
but
little
from
a
direct
contribution.
the
distinction
lies
only
in
the
fact
that
in
one
instance
the
candidate
would
apply
contributed
bonds
to
purchased
television
time
and
then
the
other,
the
union
would
buy
it
for
him.
no.
we
are
not
making
a
contribution.
we
are
stating
our
position
that
it
may
or
may
not
benefit
the
candidate.
it
may
or
may
not
be
what
he
once
said.
it
has
none
of
the
corrupting
influence
of
a
contribution
and
finally,
i'd
like
to
return
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question
of
yesterday.
i
agree
on
reflection
that
there
are
two
motives
that
we
share
in
stating
our
position.
there
are
--
it's
the
motive
of
wanting
to
win
the
election
and
there
is
the
motive
of
wanting
to
state
your
position,
but
i
say
it
is
relevant
that
there
is
the
motive
of
--
of
stating
your
position,
which
maybe
protected
by
the
constitution
more
likely
than
the
motive
of
handing
over
money.
therefore,
having
the
two
motives
is
not
a
negative
practice
such
as
was
suggested
yesterday
but
a
positive
factor.
and
in
conclusion
on
this
point
only,
i
would
like
to
make
this
statement.
before
leaving
the
question
of
statutory
construction,
i
should
like
to
advert
to
the
contention
of
the
solicitor
general
and
particularly
to
his
answers
to
mr.
justice
reed
and
mr.
justice
harlan
that
the
appropriate
action
of
this
court
would
be
the
hold
of
the
indictment
charged
in
offense
within
the
meaning
of
the
word
expenditure
and
then
return
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
a
trial
to
decide
whether
such
a
limitation
was
constitutional.
but
that's
the
opposite
of
years
of
history
of
this
court.
it
would
mean
separating
the
question
of
statutory
construction
from
the
question
of
constitutionality.
those
must
be
decided
together.
suppose
the
government
had
come
here
in
c.i.o.
and
said,
“treat
this
as
expenditure
and
let
it
go
back
to
the
district
court
to
decide
whether
it's
constitutional.”
then,
the
very
reason
that
this
court
gave
for
its
interpretation
would
not
have
been
considered.
you
cannot,
if
your
honors
please,
separate
the
constitutional
question
from
the
question
of
statutory
interpretation
because
in
this
field
more
than
any
other
one,
the
question
of
statutory
interpretation
depends
in
large
measure
through
the
doctrine
of
constitutional
doubts
upon
the
question
of
interpretation
and
that
they
are
interrelated.
now,
therefore,
if
this
indictment
is
precise
enough,
it's
clear
enough
so
that
you
can
make
a
decision
on
statutory
interpretation.
the
court
will
be
faced
with
the
constitutional
decisions.
now,
we
say
it
is
clear
enough
if
interpreted
to
charge
no
more
than
a
c.i.o.
type
advocacy
over
a
commercial
television
station,
and
if
it
charges
that
and
no
more
then
this
court
by
avoiding
the
great
constitutional
doubts
involved,
if
we
as
a
union
are
prevented
access
to
the
media
of
communication
should
interpret
the
word
expenditures
as
excluding
that
indictment
as
interpreted
by
the
district
court
and
affirming,
but
the
one
point
it
seems
to
me
is
clearly
erroneous.
in
the
distinguished
argument
that
was
made
yesterday
was
the
suggestion
that
you
decide
the
interpretative
issue
and
let
the
constitutional
one
go
back
for
trial
because
you
would
then
be
deciding
one-half
of
a
coin
that
cannot
be
split
apart.
and
now,
turning
if
your
honors
please
to
the
--
in
the
remaining
time,
to
the
question
of
constitutional
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
if
your
honors
believe
that
the
government
was
seeking
to
bury
the
interpretation
of
the
indictment
and
that
they
had
a
right
to
bury
it
at
this
time,
i
would
say
under
no
circumstances
should
it
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
as
we
have
briefed,
because
they
didn't
raise
this
--
these
interpretative
questions
before
the
district
court.
but
if
your
honor
should
overrule
me
in
two
respects,
should
first
--
well,
if
your
honors
should
--
should
hold,
they
did
raise
these
interpretative
points
on
the
indictment
below
and
should
hold
that
they
are
trying
to
bury
the
indictment.
then,
i
would
say
that
it
should
go
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
was
not
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
was
not
so
using
it,
i
should
not
have.
we
come
then
to
the
basic
question
of
constitutionality.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
sir,
that
is
my
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
sir,
i
will
do
that
right
this
moment
as
part
of
the
constitutional
argument.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
can
do
it
right
now.
i
can
say
to
--
just
to
vary
the
order
i
was
going
to
follow
that
i
--
that
the
fine
presentation
of
the
solicitor
general
yesterday
can
still
be
boiled
down
to
that
of
a
murder
defendant
who
said,
“we
didn't
do
it
but
we
were
justified
in
it.”
i
will
leave
aside
“we
didn't
do
it”
for
a
moment
and
come
to
“we
were
justified”
because
there,
were
justified
as
based
on
this
minority
argument.
if
your
honor
pleases,
this
statute
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
minorities.
this
statute
applies
if
every
member
of
the
union
supports
the
expenditure.
this
statute
applies
if
every
member
of
the
union
supports
the
same
candidate.
this
statute
applies
whether
there's
a
union
shop
or
not.
this
statute
applies
even
if
you
have
a
contracting
out
arrangement.
now,
by
that,
i
mean
necessarily.
our
union
expands
its
funds
in
this
area
for
political
broadcast
out
of
a
thing
called
the
citizenship
fund.
we
allow
any
member
who
wants
to
--
to
say
he
does
not
want
this
money
spent
for
political
activity
and
it
will
go
to
some
citizenship
funds
such
as
the
american
heritage
society.
in
other
words,
while
the
government
defends
this
statute
on
the
ground
that
it
was
intended
to
protect
minorities,
it
is
not
a
protection
of
minorities
because
you
could
have
done
that
much
simpler.
why
didn't
they
say,
“let
some
--
let
the
minorities
if
they
want
to
have
the
right
contract
out
of
the
fund”
or
why
didn't
they
say
“it's
all
right
if
there
isn't
any
minority.”
senator
taft
made
clear
what
they
were
doing.
senator
taft
said,
“the
purpose
of
this
bill
is
to
take
labor
out
of
politics.”
and
the
solicitor
general
yesterday
with
commendable
candor
said,
“the
purpose
of
the
bill
was
to
minimize
the
influenceable
of
labor
at
the
time
of
an
election.”
that
was
the
purpose.
there
was
no
purpose
of
protecting
the
minority
because
the
statute
isn't
aimed
at
the
minority
problem,”
and
in
the
area
of
free
speech
where
this
court
has
so
many
times
made
clear
that
the
--
that
the
limitation
on
speech
must
be
as
narrow
as
the
evil
presented.
if
they
were
going
to
deal
with
the
minority
problem,
it
was
absolutely
essential
that
they
limit
the
matter
to
the
minority
problem
as
that
to
say,
“unions,
you're
out
of
political
action.”
and
as
we
say
in
our
brief
and
we
have
made
a
great
deal
of
--
of
this
point,
this
statute
was
not
aimed
at
minorities
because
they
were
unanimous.
we
can't
act.
if
we
have
a
contracting
out
scheme,
we
can't
act.
if
every
member
of
our
union
wants
to
go
further
to
this,
we
cannot
act.
so,
that's
what
i
meant,
sir,
when
i
said
that
this
does
not
deal
with
the
minority
problem.
now,
what
we
have
here
is
a
denial
of
access
to
the
public
of
the
collective
use
of
union
members,
denial
of
access
to
press,
television,
radio,
magazines,
public
rallies,
letter
writing
campaigns.
what
this
statute
does
is
to
put
in
the
hands
of
the
opponents
of
labor
the
right
to
decide
whether
the
voice
of
labor
maybe
heard.
if
we
want
to
put
our
position
out,
the
decision
then
whether
it
shall
be
heard
if
the
statute
is
valid
becomes
a
decision
of
hearst,
howard
and
(inaudible).
they
control
whether
we
get
heard,
but
if
can
buy
the
time
then
we
decide
whether
we
could
be
heard.
this
statute
as
i
say
denies
union's
access
to
the
media
of
communication
except
at
the
will
of
the
opponents
of
labor,
and
it's
a
denial
of
free
speech
at
the
very
heart
of
the
democratic
process.
the
great
decisions
of
this
court
in
stromberg
and
in
near,
the
great
dissent
in
whitney
are
based
on
the
proposition
that
free
government
by
free
men
depends
upon
all
discussion
of
the
great
issues
of
political
life.
if
there
is
to
be
peaceful
change
in
america,
it
must
come
from
the
--
these
orderly
processes
of
democracy
in
which
the
great
segments
of
the
population
can
be
heard.
now,
this
court's
protections
of
the
first
amendment
have
gone
far
beyond
what
we
are
asking,
not
only
has
a
presumption
of
constitutionality
been
reversed,
but
lesser
restriction
such
as
taxes,
licenses,
regulations
on
extremer
sects
have
been
knocked
out
by
this
court
without
reference
to
the
degree
of
--
of
influence
of
the
ideas
involved.
what
we
have
here
is
not
a
partial
restraint
on
noxious
doctrines
but
a
complete
prohibition
on
politically
significant
speech.
can
it
be
that
speech,
free
speech
is
intended
to
protect
extremer
sects
but
not
those
groups
where
there
will
be
actual
influence
on
the
processes
of
democracy?
is
speech
importantly
only
to
the
point
of
actual
influence
on
the
workings
of
american
life?
well,
i
think
the
answer
speaks
for
itself
and
if
the
court
please,
political
activity
has
been
an
integral
part
of
trade
union
activity
in
america
for
the
100
years
of
our
political
activities.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
there
are
differences,
sir,
between
a
union
and
a
business
corporation.
a
union
is
a
group
of
men
with
a
common
interest.
a
business
corporation
gets
its
--
has
its
control
in
the
man
who
owns
the
most
stock.
it
gets
its
money
from
a
public,
which
is
completely
disparate
in
views.
therefore,
one
can
make
a
distinction
between
a
corporation
and
a
union
and
the
decision
of
the
corporation
will
have
to
come
here
someday
if
that
case
is
raised.
i
personally
raised
none
and
our
union
takes
the
position
publicly
that
we
feel
that
democracy
is
best
protected
by
corporations
having
the
same
right
to
state
their
position
on
candidates
that
we
have.
i
can
only
say,
sir,
that
there
are
differences
between
corporations
and
unions
which
might
at
some
future
time
create
a
difference
in
results,
i
urge
none.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
we
urge
no
differentiation.
for
100
years,
if
your
honors
please,
we
have
been
engaged
in
political
activity.
our
own
union
constitution
from
the
first
day
urges
that
one
cannot
draw
a
line
between
bargaining
and
politics.
bargaining
is
supplemented
by
legislation
and
legislation
is
supplemented
by
bargaining.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
would
say
reasonable
limitations.
it
would
depend
whether
that
was
a
reasonable
limitation
on
--
on
free
speech.
no
effort
was
made
to
do
any
of
these
things.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
they
might
try
that
on
the
individuals.
i
--
i
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
it
might.
i
will
say,
if
you
had
a
general
regulatory
statute
limiting
expenditures,
i
see
no
reason
why
we
shouldn't
be
part
of
it.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
would
think
that
if
you
had
a
--
yes.
basically,
i
--
i
would
say
that
you
--
there
are
rights
to
speak
here
that
--
that
ought
to
be
protected.
now,
i
haven't
thought
about
the
sheer
matter
of
--
of
money
limitation
because
it
sounds
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
it
sounds
--
i
only
would
suggest,
sir,
that
it
--
it
sounds
rather
artificial
because
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
on
the
extent,
well,
we
would
be.
you
have
now
a
bar
at
the
same
bar
we
are
under,
but
there
are
no
--
not
--
there
are
no
--
no
numerical
limitation,
sir.
the
limitations
are
on
the
candidate's
expenditures
and
it
is
his
--
it's
absolutely
historically
a
matter
of
record
that
they
are
not
complied
with.
it's
in
the
daily
press
that
the
expenditures
limit
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
but
there
are
no
limitations
of
this
type
other
than
on
candidates
as
to
my
knowledge
ever
been
attempted.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
sir,
of
$5000
which
is
awarded
by
giving
to
different
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
each
committee,
yes
sir.
now,
you
cannot
split
legislation
from
bargaining.
at
the
bargaining
table,
we
get
blue
cross
and
blue
shield.
and
at
the
congress,
we
asked
for
national
health
insurance
to
supplement
it.
in
congress,
we
get
unemployment
compensation
and
at
the
bargaining
table,
we
supplement
it
with
supplementary
unemployment
payment.
this
is
as
one
what
you
have
here
the
bargaining
and
the
legislative
process.
now,
this
would
mean
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
a
great
burden
on
the
government
to
sustain
a
denial
of
speech
so
clearly
at
the
heart
of
the
democratic
process
and
particularly
a
denial
of
speech
at
this
moment
in
--
in
our
history.
when
through
reckless
men,
there's
been
a
weakening
of
political
processes
at
home
and
when
through
other
men
--
other
nations
have
threatened
democracy
abroad
to
limit
the
generative
force
of
ideas
that
comes
from
labor
by
taking
it
out
at
this
crucial
period,
it
seems
to
us
gives
a
great
burden
for
the
government
to
meet.
and
now,
if
i
may
return
to
the
question
that
the
chief
justice
addressed
to
me,
it
--
what
is
the
justification
that
the
government
puts
up
for
this?
first
they
say,
“we
didn't
do
anything
to
you.”
for
13
pages
of
their
brief
from
pages
37
to
50,
the
government
argues
that
we're
still
in
business
just
the
way
we
are
before
because
of
the
use
of
voluntary
funds.
but
if
your
honors
please,
the
government's
own
brief
at
page
50
answers
this
very
question.
if
you'll
look
at
page
50
down
after
citing
for
this
purpose,
we
use
--
they're
citing
one
of
our
organs,
not
the
uaw's
but
a
labor
organ.
we
use
radio
broadcast,
our
weekly
newspapers
as
well
as
special
releases
of
various
sorts
to
finance
these
activities.
each
international
was
asked
to
contribute
10
cents
per
member
for
the
whole
period
during
december
1,
1949
and
february
1,
1950.
in
other
words,
what
the
government
is
claiming
was
voluntary
funds.
it's
perfectly
clearly
was
dues
money.
cope,
pac,
llpe
are
no
substitute
for
dues
money.
no
moneys
have
ever
been
raised
for
this
kind
of
making
access
to
the
public
mind
for
making
political
actions
of
this
kind.
this
has
never
been
a
part
of
their
work
and
of
course
we
in
the
uaw
have
no
such
activity.
our
activity
in
this
field
is
carried
out
and
can
only
be
carried
out
with
the
dues
money
that
we
have
available
to
us.
now,
the
government
says
they
didn't
do
it
and
i
have
answered
that.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
the
only
funds
available
to
the
union
are
those
that
come
from
dues
for
the
purpose
of
buying
radio
time,
television
time,
and
newspaper
advertising.
the
small
amount,
sir
that
has
been
able
to
be
collected
as
voluntary
dollars
has
all
gone
as
contributions
to
the
very
small
contributions
to
the
candidates.
we
have
never
had
the
type
of
funds
on
voluntary
dollars.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well
sir,
a
union
man
thinks
he's
paid
when
he's
paid
his
dues.
he
thinks
he's
paid
for
bargaining,
for
legislation
and
for
political
activity.
he
doesn't
feel
he
should
pay
a
second
time
for
political
activity
that's
why
it's
so
hard
to
raise
voluntary
contributions.
our
constitution
and
the
constitution
of
all
union
sets
this
up
as
a
purpose,
political
action.
when
he
pays
his
dues,
he
has
paid
for
his
political
action.
he
may
give
another
dollar
to
some
candidate
for
--
for
an
office,
but
he
doesn't
feel
he's
going
to
give
another
some
more
money.
we
have
collected
a
little
but
never
anything
to
do
this
job
of
making
the
public
know
our
view.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
there
was
such
a
leader,
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
there
has
been
history
the
other
way
but
political
life
has
for
a
long
--
has
--
there
is
history
back
100
years.
there
was
a
period
as
you
suggest
when
this
was
the
view
of
some
leading
labor
for
it.
so,
what
does
the
government
suggest
that
this
justified
was
trying
to
minimize
the
influence?
these
are
the
solicitor
general's
commendable
frankness.
it
was
trying
to
minimize
the
influence
of
unions
of
election.
maybe
that
would
be
proper
but
there
was
no
evidence.
minority
protection,
i
have
indicated
the
statute
did
not
deal
with
minority
protection.
so,
if
your
honors
please,
what
we
have
is
the
great
burden
upon
the
united
states
government
to
justify
such
an
infriction
--
infraction
on
free
speech
with
no,
no
reasons
giving
to
support
that
burden.
now,
if
your
honors
would
recall
a
little
history
of
this
statute
in
conclusion,
there
was
not
a
witness
before
this
congress
on
the
question
of
political
expenditures.
congress
was
passing
a
law
regulating
labor
and
what
it
did
was
to
throw
in
this
restriction
on
political
expenditures.
in
the
law
regulating
labor,
without
ever
having
hearings
on
that
question
and
without
ever
having
thorough
consideration
of
it,
it
was
as
one
commentator
cited
in
--
in
the
government's
brief
so
aptly
said
it
was
thrown
in
when
labor
was
down
in
a
losing
struggle.
and
it
was
thrown-in
in
violation
of
our
rights
of
free
speech
and
it
was
thrown
in
i
might
say
and
has
the
opposition
of
every
unreversed
judicial
decision
in
this
area.
every
unreversed
judicial
decision
in
the
area
of
this
statute
has
favored
the
free
speech
consideration.
the
c.i.o.
district
court,
this
court
here,
five
justices
referred
to
the
gravest
doubt
of
constitutionality
and
foreheld
it
was
unconstitutional.
the
painters
local
case,
the
general
labor's
case,
the
massachusetts
supreme
court
has
a
decision
exactly
on
point
and
finally
the
district
court
here.
every
judicial
action
today
has
indicated
either
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute
or
the
gravest
doubts
about
it.
and
so,
in
conclusion
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
sir.
they
are
not
exempted.
they
have
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
sir,
but
what
has
happened
is
that
the
government
has
interpreted
senator
taft's
words
as
reasons
for
not
prosecuting.
i
think
they
are
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
oh,
they
would
be
given
--
but
the
--
their
expense
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
sir.
but
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
their
expenditure
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
it
would
in
my
judgment
be
an
expenditure.
it
would
be
one
that
senator
taft
indicates
was
not
to
be
barred
by
the
statute.
the
government
has
acted
on
senator
taft's
interpretation
and
has
never
prosecuted
a
newspaper
even
for
saying
things
much
rougher
and
more
political
advocacy
than
we
have
done
here.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
the
government
would
not
prosecute,
sir
and
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
sir.
the
government
has
made
that
clear
and
i
think
that's
clear
in
the
--
and
--
and
they
based
their
decision
on
senator
taft's
view.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
we
believe,
sir
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
sir,
and
that
the
act
is
highly
discriminatory.
labor
unions
are
the
only
associations
of
individuals
as
to
whom
the
statute
believe.
we
have
an
entire
point
of
this
arbitrary
discrimination.
in
our
brief,
which
raises
a
newspaper
point
that
you
are
making
but
we
assume
from
the
government's
conduct
in
the
--
that
they
are
excluding
under
senator
taft's
rulings
or
senator
taft's
statement,
the
newspapers
from
the
purview
of
the
statue
and
that
this
only
accentuates
the
arbitrary
character
of
taking
labor
out
from
all
else
and
saying,
“your
voice
shall
not
be
heard.”
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
sir.
the
news
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that
--
precisely
and
that
is
based
on
an
--
on
a
statement
by
senator
taft
but
as
i
would
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
it
--
i
think
that
--
that's
maybe
great.
i
would
only
say
that
the
question
put
to
me
by
mr.
justice
black,
accentuates
the
arbitrary
character
of
a
statute
that
is
limited
in
its
activity
and
is
limited
in
this
prohibition
to
only
one
association
of
individuals
and
whose
views
are
prevented
from
expression
at
the
time
they
are
needed
most.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
all
newspapers
seemed
to
be
in
that
character
with
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
with
this
exception,
if
your
honor
please
--
i'm
sorry,
my
time
has
expired.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
thank
you,
sir.
with
this
exception,
the
solicitor
general
said
yesterday
that
a
labor
paper
could
only
go
to
labor.
and
there's
no
--
that
is
in
the
statement
made
yesterday
as
to
the
holding
of
the
c.i.o.
cases.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
--
that
was
reserved.
but
on
the
government's
interpretation,
a
labor
paper
must
be
limited
to
labor
members.
certainly,
a
newspaper
goes
to
the
broadest
possible
field.
so,
we
are
being
limited
even
more
than
the
newspapers
and
the
discrimination
here
seems
to
be
a
newspaper
can
get
to
the
public,
labor
may
not.
