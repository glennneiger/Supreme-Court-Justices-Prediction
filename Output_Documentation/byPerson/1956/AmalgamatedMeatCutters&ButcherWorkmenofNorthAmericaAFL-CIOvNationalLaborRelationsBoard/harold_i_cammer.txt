section
9
(h)
of
the
national
labor
--
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
of
1947
conditions
a
union's
right
to
participate
in
elections
and
to
be
protective
against
unfair
labor
practices
by
board
procedures
upon
the
annual
filing
by
each
of
its
officers
of
the
non-communist
affidavit
provided
by
the
section.
section
9
(h)
reads,
“the
provisions
of
section
35
(a)
of
the
criminal
code,
now
18
u.s.c.
1001,
shall
be
applicable
to
such
affidavits.”
the
question
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
upon
a
subsequent
conviction
of
one
of
the
officers
of
a
union
for
having
filed
in
one
year
a
false
9
(h)
affidavit,
there
is
to
be
visited
in
addition
to
the
criminal
sanctions
against
the
false
affiant,
the
sanction
of
retroactive
decompliance
of
the
union.
and
if
so,
whether
such
decompliance
shall
be
extended
for
a
period
beyond
the
term
of
the
affidavit,
the
period
of
the
affidavit
which
supported
the
union's
compliance,
and
if
so
further,
whether
such
decompliance
should
be
imposed
while
the
conviction
is
subjudicie
pending
on
appeal
and
where
the
appeal
presents
substantial
questions.
we
have
in
this
case
also,
if
the
court
please,
a
res
judicata
question
with
regard
to
whether
the
sixth
circuit
properly
denied
effect
to
the
decision
--
the
decisions
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
which
in
the
series
of
cases
between
this
union
and
the
labor
board,
had
held
that
the
union's
compliance
was
not
affected
by
the
false
affidavit.
the
facts
are
these.
in
august
of
1950
and
annually
thereafter
in
1951,
1952
and
1953,
the
fur
&
leather
workers
union
complied,
that
is
its
officers
filed
the
section
9
(h)
affidavit.
in
1952,
at
a
time
when
the
union's
compliance
was
predicated
upon
the
1951
affidavit,
the
board
on
charges
filed
by
the
union
issued
its
complaint
of
unfair
labor
practices
against
the
respondent,
lannom
manufacturing
company.
and
in
march
1953,
it
issued
a
decision
and
order
finding
lannom
guilty
of
having
coerced
its
employees
and
among
other
things
directed
the
reinstatement
of
24
workers
with
back
pay.
after
the
board's
proceedings
and
in
august
1953,
one
of
the
officers
of
the
union,
the
president,
ben
gold,
was
indicted
for
having
filed
a
false
section
9
(h)
affidavit
in
1950.
although
at
that
time
that
the
indictment
was
returned
is
1951,
1952
and
1953
affidavits
were
on
file,
the
indictment
did
not
reach
--
did
not
attack
the
integrity
of
those
affidavits.
and
in
april
1954,
gold
was
convicted.
gold's
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
by
an
evenly
divided
vote
of
4-to-4,
and
certiorari
in
that
case
has
been
granted
by
this
court
in
the
case.
his
conviction
is
now
pending
here
on
review.
following
gold's
conviction,
the
labor
board
issued
--
the
respondent,
labor
board,
issued
an
order
to
show
cause
to
the
union
as
to
why
it
should
not
be
decomplied
because
of
the
conviction.
it
also
rejected
gold's
1954
affidavit
because
of
his
conviction
on
the
1950
affidavit.
in
an
action
for
an
in
junction
brought
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia,
an
injunction
was
issued
and
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
were
made
to
the
effect
that
the
union's
compliance
status
was
not
affected
by
the
falsity,
by
the
conviction
on
the
1950
affidavit.
the
court
held
that
the
scheme
of
section
9
(h)
was
explicit,
that
congress
intended
to
provide
solely
the
criminal
sanction
for
a
false
affidavit
and
it
had
rejected
the
notion
of
--
set
additional
sanctions
against
the
union
as
well.
this
injunction
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
this
litigation
had
been
preceded
by
two
earlier
cases
where
the
board
in
the
district
of
columbia,
where
the
board
had
set
--
sought
to
set
aside
and
to
suspend
the
union's
compliance
status
because
of
charges
that
gold's
affidavit
was
false.
when
gold
had
been
indicted
in
1953,
the
labor
board
had
suspended
--
had
undertaken
to
suspend
the
union's
compliance
status
pending
the
outcome
of
the
indictment
and
that
action
was
enjoined
in
an
opinion
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
and
i
might
say
denied
certiorari
by
this
court.
before
that,
the
labor
board
had
also
sought
to
impair
or
suspend
the
union's
compliance
status
because
gold,
in
appearing
before
a
grand
jury,
had
asserted
the
fifth
amendment
with
regard
to
whether
his
affidavit
was
true
or
false.
and
the
board's
action
in
that
regard
had
been
enjoined
by
the
labor
board,
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
certiorari
had
been
denied
by
this
court.
in
response
to
the
injunction
which
was
issued
against
the
labor
board,
it
then
moved
to
enforce
its
unfair
labor
practice
order
against
lannom
and
it
filed
the
petition
for
enforcement
in
the
sixth
circuit.
that
court,
without
reaching
the
merits
of
the
board's
unfair
labor
practice
order,
dismissed
the
enforcement
petition
on
the
grounds
that
the
union
was
retroactively
decomplied
to
1950
because
of
the
conviction,
said
that
it
disagree
with
the
line
of
holdings
in
the
--
in
the
district
of
columbia,
and
it
said
that
because
of
the
conviction
of
the
--
on
the
1950
affidavit,
it
would
presume
that
the
1951
affidavit
was
also
false.
and
that
being
false,
there
was
no
compliance
in
1952,
and
therefore,
it
would
deny
the
enforcement
of
petition.
it
also
said
that
it
would
not
--
it
regarded
the
sixth
circuit
decision
as
not
pointing
upon
it
or
upon
lannom
because
lannom
was
not
a
party
to
the
litigation
there.
now,
the
decompliance
of
a
union
means
that
all
unfair
labor
practices
to
which
it
maybe
subjected
are
retroactively
irremediable,
all
elections
in
which
it
has
participated
during
the
--
the
period
of
its
compliance
are
null
and
void,
contracts
which
it
has
entered
into
on
the
basis
of
certifications
issued
by
the
labor
board
are
invalidated.
now,
with
regard
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
power
to
decomply
because
of
a
false
affidavit,
the
first
thing
which
must
be
noted
is
that
neither
the
court
below
nor
the
--
nor
the
labor
board
before
this
court
contends
that
there
is
any
expressed
power
in
the
statute
for
the
decompliance
of
the
union.
as
far
as
a
statute
reads,
the
only
sanction
is
a
criminal
one.
the
board
is
therefore
relegated
to
arguing
that
it
--
that
it
has
an
implied
power
to
decomply.
and
that
--
that
the
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
which
bars
this
implied
power.
the
board
does
not
contend
that
there
is
anything
in
the
legislative
history
which
supports
an
implied
power
to
decomply
the
union,
does
retroactively
but
merely
that
nothing
was
said
against
the
power.
now,
the
legislative
history,
the
--
the
--
shows
that
congress
did
consider
various
alternatives
against
possibility
of
false
section
9
(h)
affidavits
being
filed,
and
that
it
concluded
after
deliberating
various
alternative
sanctions
that
it
would
rely
solely
and
entirely
upon
the
criminal
sanctions
against
the
false
affiant
and
that
it
would
not
seek
to
impose
any
sanction
against
the
union
in
that
regard.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
in
--
in
this
case,
your
honor,
the
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
the
--
the
board
rest
entirely
upon
the
conviction
for
a
demonstration
of
the
falsity
of
the
affidavit.
there
was
a
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
yes,
sir.
now,
when
--
when
the
original
proposals
for
the
taft-hartley
act
were
before
the
congress,
the
bill
is
originally
passed
in
the
house
provided
that
if
a
union
were
led
by
communist,
the
union
would
not
be
entitled
to
the
protection
or
the
benefits
of
the
act.
it
was
considerable
criticism
in
the
attack
against
the
legislation
then
pending
on
the
ground
that
it
would
hold
up
board
proceedings
forever
if
investigations
were
to
be
preliminarily
conducted
with
regard
to
whether
or
not
the
officers
of
the
union
were
in
fact
communists.
and
senator
taft,
when
the
matter
went
at
the
conference,
came
up
with
the
proposal
that
the
fact
of
filing
that
if
a
requirement
for
filing
the
non-communist
affidavits
were
imposed,
that
would
very
adequately
take
care
of
the
matter
and
that
the
union
would
have
discharged
and
done
whatever
it
could
by
electing
officers
who
represented
themselves
as
able
to
file
these
affidavits.
and
senator
taft
said
that
there
would
be
no
delay
in
the
processing
of
the
union's
representation
or
any
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
i
believe
that's
at
page
12
of
my
brief,
mr.
chief
justice.
page
13,
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
in
presenting
the
conference
reports,
senator
taft
said
that
the
criminal
sanction
for
a
false
affidavit
had
been
agreed
upon
so
that
a
false
affidavit
would
not
hold
up
the
certification
of
a
union,
but
any
communist
who
makes
a
false
affidavit
can
be
sent
to
jail.
and
he
added
further
that
an
affidavit
is
sufficient
for
the
board's
purposes
since
the
penal
provisions
of
section
35
(a)
are
made
applicable
to
such
affidavits.
he
--
he
then
said
that
under
the
amendment
an
affidavit
is
sufficient
for
the
board's
purposes
and
there
is
no
delay
unless
an
officer
of
the
moving
union
refuses
to
file
the
affidavit
required.
there
was
other
discussion
in
the
--
in
the
senate
which
indicated
pretty
clearly
that
the
congress
was
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
criminal
sanction
against
the
union.
they
referred
to
the
morsani
case.
there's
an
example
where
one
who
had
lied
in
disclaiming
communist
membership
had
been
punished.
and
they
indicated
quite
plainly
that
they
were
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
efficacy
and
the
adequacy
of
the
criminal
remedy.
now,
the
board
argues
citing
cases
where
it
was
upheld
in
its
refusal
to
issue
a
complaint
under
circumstances
where
abuse
of
the
board's
process
was
indicated
that
it
should
have
the
power
to
prevent
an
abuse
of
its
process
here
by
processing
cases
based
upon
false
9
(h)
affidavits.
the
board
cites
for
example,
the
indiana
and
michigan
case
where
it
was
upheld
in
its
refusal
to
--
to
issue
a
complaint
where
charges
had
been
filed,
this
part
of
a
conspiracy
to
export
as
a
part
of
a
shake-down
operation.
there
are
other
cases
where
the
board
has
been
upheld
in
its
refusal
to
issue
a
complaint
where
it
found
that
the
motivation
was
not
the
correction
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
but
some
ulterior
and
sinister
motive.
and
there
are
cases
as
well
where
the
board
--
which
--
which
it
cites
where
the
board
has
refused
to
--
to
process
elections,
where
the
authorization
clause,
the
representation
clause,
where
it
found
forged
and
improper.
now,
those
cases
have
nothing
or
whatver
to
do
with
this
problem.
the
congress
has
vested
in
the
board
the
power
to
correct
unfair
labor
practices,
the
power
to
exercise
discretion
with
regard
to
how
they
should
be
corrected
and
under
what
circumstances
they
should
be
corrected.
it
has
likewise
vested
in
the
board
the
power
to
determine
appropriate
units
and
when
election
should
be
held.
but
congress
has
not
vested
in
this
board
the
power
to
decide
who
is
in
compliance
or
how
one
achieves
compliance.
the
congress
is
very
precisely
to
say
that
there
are
particular
financial
reports,
registration
statements
and
non-communist
affidavits
to
be
filed
and
whoever
files
them
is
incompliant.
and
if
there
is
an
abuse
of
that
filing,
congress
have
said,
"we
will
handle
that
matter
through
the
department
of
justice
and
through
the
criminal
procedures."
the
board
has
no
function,
has
no
jurisdiction
with
regard
to
this
area.
for
the
same
reason,
the
highland
park
case,
the
coca-cola
case
and
the
(inaudible)
case
which
is
cited
by
the
board
have
no
relevance
because
those
cases
dealt
with
whether
or
not
there
had
been
compliance
with
the
conditions
set
by
congress,
whether
or
not
congress
having
said,
"all
of
the
officers
must
comply,"
the
board
had
power
to
determine
whether
in
fact
the
officers
had
complied
and
how
that
matter
was
to
be
tested
and
ascertained
but
there
is
no
such
question
here.
here,
the
officers
had
complied.
they
have
met
the
standards
of
congress.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
as
far
as
the
board
is
concerned,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
it
have
to
go
ahead
and
send
this
fellow
to
jail.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
well,
only
if
you
don't
think
that
the
criminal
sanction
is
--
is
meaningful,
but
bearing
in
mind
that
one
does
go
to
jail
for
making
the
false
statement,
does
not
make
it
meaningful.
be
that
as
it
may,
that's
something
congress
did
consider
and
they
did
decide
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
there's
no
doubt
about
the
fact
that
you're
correct
about
that,
your
honor.
but
the
--
the
conclusion,
however,
supports
our
view
because
where
--
when
you
consider
that
the
affidavit
has
enough
to
see
of
only
one
year,
when
you
consider
further
that
criminal
proceedings,
criminal
prosecution
as
indeed
in
this
case
came
three
years
after
the
affidavit
had
been
filed
and
two
years
after
it
had
ceased
to
have
any
vitality.
when
it
further
considered
that
the
case
is
on
appeal
and
with
the
delays
that
are
inherent
in
criminal
prosecutions,
i
think
it's
inconceivable
that
congress
would
have
wished
to
hold
up
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
and
representation
proceedings
until
criminal
cases
were
concluded.
that
is
a
criminal
case
which
would
resolve
this
problem.
and
senator
taft
said
that
the
union
will
not
be
delayed
but
that
the
affiant,
the
communist
who
makes
the
false
affidavit
will
go
to
jail.
there
is
no
possible
way
to
condition
the
criminal
--
to
--
to
condition
the
representation
proceedings
and
the
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
upon
the
possibility
that
criminal
proceedings
may
or
may
not
come,
and
if
they
do
come,
how
--
that
will
be
the
outcome
of
that.
the
whole
thing
falls
apart.
now,
if
--
in
addition
to
that,
if
there
is
the
possibility
that
criminal
proceedings
may
vitiate
the
certifications
and
the
election
and
so
on,
then
with
the
limited
budget
that
the
board
has
and
that
its
--
its
expresses
their
concern
about,
the
only
caution
--
proper
way
perhaps
would
be
for
them
to
wait
until
the
statute
of
limitations
are
done
or
the
possibility
of
a
criminal
prosecution
before
running
an
election.
now,
that
is
exactly
what
has
happened
here
in
1954.
this
is
only
one
aspect
of
the
--
of
the
decompliance
problem.
in
1954,
these
24
workers
learned
that
they
are
remediless
against
the
employer's
unfair
labor
practice
because
at
that
time,
gold
had
been
convicted,
four
years
after
he
filed
the
affidavit.
now,
in
view
of
the
havoc
which
i
think
is
apparent
from
the
retroactive
decompliance
of
a
union
not
only
in
terms
--
the
narrow
terms
of
this
case
but
because
all
of
the
union
--
all
of
the
contracts
which
the
union
has
entered
into
in
the
four-year
period
from
1950
to
1954,
not
only
the
union
but
every
local
union
of
the
union,
every
district
court,
every
affiliate
and
have
a
constituent
to
the
union,
everyone
of
those
agreement
to
the
extent
that
they
may
have
union
security
provisions
is
retroactively
invalidated.
there
is
no
longer
a
bar
to
elections,
to
raise
by
rival
unions
and
all
unfair
labor
practices
which
may
have
been,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
may
have
been
perpetrated
or
committed
in
that
period
are
without
remedies.
now,
in
view
of
those
very
serious
and
drastic
consequences,
i
think
it's
conceivable
that
an
implied
power,
that
it
should
be
left
to
argue.
congress
having
considered
this
matter
that
it
would
not
have
provided
expressly
for
decompliance
in
the
face
of
--
of
the
filing
of
a
false
affidavit.
finally,
i
think
that
the
action,
the
--
the
decision
below,
the
imposition
of
this
kind
of
a
sanction
against
the
union
in
effect
imposes
a
hostage
theory
of
justice.
the
members
of
the
union
i
think
have
done
everything
at
was
in
their
power
to
comply
with
the
act
when
they
elect
officers
who
represent
themselves
as
able
to
file
and
willing
to
file
the
non-communist
affidavit.
and
if
it
turns
out
later
that
one
of
them
as
the
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
said
that
one
of
the
officers
has
deceived
the
union
as
well
as
the
board
by
the
filing
of
a
false
affidavit,
it
is
--
it
violates
our
notions
of
personal
responsibility
to
visit
the
effects
of
gold's
crime,
assuming
he
committed
a
crime
upon
these
24
workers
in
tennessee
insofar
as
the
record
shows,
joined
the
union
which
held
the
certificate
of
compliance
from
the
national
labor
relations
board,
now
which
in
all
respects,
complied
with
the
law.
now,
this
is
a
different
problem
in
the
highland
park
problem
which
the
board
says
is
analogous.
they
say
if
this
kind
of
disruption
was
imposed
by
highland
park.
there's
no
reason
why
it
should
not
--
the
worker
shouldn't
be
subject
to
it
here.
but
in
highland
park,
the
union
had
failed
to
comply
with
the
congressional
conditions.
its
officers,
the
officers
of
the
union,
this
court
found
the
officers
of
the
national
afl-cio
federations
had
not
filed
a
non-communist
affidavit.
but
here,
all
of
the
officers
have
filed.
that
was
made
a
condition
of
holding
a
union
office
and
it's
--
i
think
unconstitutional
to
--
to
punish
these
workers
for
the
crime
of
an
officer
in
new
york.
our
second
proposition
is
that
ethan
however,
if
there
is
a
power
to
decomply
for
the
filing
of
a
false
affidavit,
the
sixth
circuit
was
wrong
in
holding
that
our
decompliance
extended
into
1951,
when
compliance
was
based
upon
an
affidavit
which
was
not
the
subject
of
an
indictment
or
of
a
conviction.
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
because
of
gold's
conviction
on
the
1950
affidavit,
his
1951
affidavit
is
to
be
presumed
false
as
well.
well,
if
the
falsity
is
to
be
based
upon
a
presumption,
then
we
are
away
from
--
from
the
question
you
asked
earlier
mr.
justice
harlan
as
to
how
is
the
falsity
demonstrated.
there
was
no
conviction
here
on
the
1951
affidavit.
no
hearings
were
held
which
established
at
the
1951
affidavit
was
false.
no
opportunity
for
hearings
was
ever
presented
and
the
presumption
or
the
assumptions
indulged
in
by
the
sixth
circuit
over
the
dissent
of
judge
stewart's
that
because
he
was
a
communist
in
1950,
he
was
therefore
a
member
of
the
communist
party
of
1951
and
then
after
that
was
therefore
for
is
untenable.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
yes,
your
honor,
they
do.
that
is
on
--
on
the
language
of
the
statute,
and
the
decision
of
this
court
in
dant
against
in
n.l.r.b.
in
344
u.s.,
requires
compliance
at
the
time
of
the
issuance
of
the
board's
complaint.
that
is
the
jurisdictional
test
of
whether
the
union
is
in
compliance.
now,
the
board's
complaint
having
been
issued
in
february
1952
that
you
--
its
compliance
was
then
based
on
the
1951
affidavit.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
it's
functus
officio
as
far
as
the
union's
compliance
status
is
concerned
unless
we
accept
this
presumption
which
is
expressed
by
the
sixth
circuit
and
adopted
by
the
board
that
once
a
communist,
always
a
communist,
the
1950
affidavit
being
false,
the
1951
affidavit
is
also
false.
and
as
i
say,
that
--
that
is
not
based
on
any
hearing
or
evidence
in
the
record
and
judge
stewart
dissented
on
that
ground.
now,
the
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that's
what
the
statute
said
itself.
now,
the
third
point
that
deals
with
the
fact
that
if
there
is
again
to
be
decompliance,
if
these
terrible
drastic
consequences
upon
the
union
retroacted
decompliance
ought
to
be
visited
then
it
should
not
be
done
while
the
conviction
is
still
on
appeal.
certainly,
not
on
appeal
in
the
case
such
as
here
where
the
record
showed
before
the
sixth
circuit
that
the
appeal
presented
substantial
questions.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
no,
what
is
--
what
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
well,
this
court
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
well,
what
--
what
that
does,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
is
to
emphasize
how
long
the
sixth
circuit
was
in
this
regard.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
well,
no.
what
it
--
what
it
means
is
that
if
--
if
the
conviction
--
if
they
should
not
have
decomplied
as
until
the
conviction
is
final,
final
in
--
in
a
real
sense
after
the
appeals,
after
there
has
been
an
appeal,
then
they
should
have
enforced
the
labor
board
order
down
below.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
well,
now
the
trouble
with
--
with
holding
that
up
is
that
you'd
have
to
hold
this
up
perhaps
for
10
years.
suppose
--
suppose
the
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
well,
the
gold
case
was
under
consideration
after
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
a
year.
it
was
argued
in
march
1955
and
decided
in
march
1956
and
then
affirmed
4-to-4.
now,
assume
that
in
1957
after
gold,
there'll
be
an
order
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
we
go
back.
we
have
appeals.
we
might
easily
be
in
1960
to
decide
whether
in
1950,
the
union
was
in
compliance.
now,
if
gold
is
--
is
affirmed,
all
right.
if
gold
is
reversed
and
there
is
an
acquittal,
then
the
union
has
been
unjustly
deprived
of
the
compliance
status
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
well,
no.
if
--
if
i
should
lose,
that's
my
third
line
of
defense,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
if
--
if
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
all
right.
if
--
if
there
is
a
power
to
decomply
and
if
the
1951
affidavit
is
false
because
the
1950
affidavit
is
also
is
--
is
false
why
then
at
least
the
union
would
not
to
be
subjected
to
--
to
this
--
the
hardship
until
the
appeal
has
been
exhausted
and
it's
determined
whether
or
not
it's
filed.
now,
there
is
language
cited
by
the
board
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
the
original
charge
was
filed
in
1951
during
the
--
during
the
time
that
1950
--
the
1950
affidavit
was
in
effect.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
it
was
thereafter
amended
several
times.
the
complaint
was
issued
on
the
basis
of
an
amendment
filed
in
february
1952,
an
amended
the
charge,
when
the
1951
affidavit
is
in
effect.
but
i
--
i
must
again
say
that
the
statute
makes
the
issuance
of
the
complaint,
the
critical
date
for
compliance
purposes.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
sir?
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
at
that
time,
i
think
the
statute.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
i
believe
so.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
very
much
so,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
the
--
the
unfair
labor
practices
are
unremedied.
in
--
in
the
sense
that
the
unfair
labor
practices
assuming
they
would
be
sustained
are
still
unremedied.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
well,
threats
against
the
workers
if
they
would
join
the
union
that
they
would
be
discharged,
the
actual
discharge
of
24
workers.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
yes.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
24,
your
honor.
24
workers
were
discharged.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
there
is.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
with
back
pay
but
the
--
the
sixth
circuit
refused
to
--
that's
the
one
that
they
refused
to
report.
now,
the
fourth
--
my
fourth
line
of
defense
in
this
case,
if
the
court
please,
is
that
even
if
we're
wrong
on
all
these
--
the
first
three
grounds,
the
sixth
circuit
should
have
give
in
effect
to
the
decisions
in
this
case,
a
particular
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
which
had
held
that
our
compliance
status
was
not
impaired
by
the
--
by
the
conviction.
the
court
argues
in
50
--
in
--
in
case
number
57
which
is
to
follow
and
the
court
below
also
indicated
that
they
were
solving
this
problem
by
separating
the
question
of
the
falsity
of
the
affidavit
from
the
proceeding
in
which
the
unfair
labor
practice
was
being
heard
or
from
the
election
or
representation
proceedings.
so
they
--
so
they
thought
and
considerable
emphasis
is
placed
on
the
ground
that
these
problems
are
going
to
be
resolved
in
the
separate
administrative
proceeding.
well,
inherent
in
the
concept
of
a
separate
administrative
proceeding
is
the
notion
that
once
that
proceeding
is
held,
the
union's
status
for
compliance
purposes
is
determined
with
some
finality
as
to
all
parties.
it
would
mean
that
if
the
board
found
that
the
union
was
or
was
not
in
compliance,
the
next
employee
who
came
around
and
sought
to
relitigate
the
issue
of
compliance
would
be
told
that
this
question
has
been
settled
in
another
in
a
separate
proceeding
even
though
you
were
not
a
party
to
it.
and
employer
b
couldn't
come
around
and
c
and
d
and
say,
"well,
i
wasn't
a
party
to
the
proceeding
because
the
thing
would
be
litigated
forever."
well,
that's
exactly
what
happened
in
this
case.
the
situs
under
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
board,
the
situs
of
an
international
union's
compliance
status
is
within
the
district
of
columbia.
litigation
and
the
district
of
columbia
is
the
only
court
which
is
a
proper
forum
for
litigation
against
the
board.
in
litigation
between
the
union
and
the
board,
it
was
decided
that
our
compliance
status
was
not
impaired
by
the
conviction,
and
the
board
was
enjoined
from
impairing
our
compliance
status
because
of
the
conviction.
what
the
sixth
circuit
in
effect
has
done
is
to
--
told
the
board
to
violate
the
injunction
of
the
sixth
--
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
and
to
say,
"you
--
well,
you
go
right
ahead
and
treat
this
union
as
though
it
were
not
in
compliance."
it's
completely
unrealistic
to
think
that
the
board
having
the
sixth
circuit
decision
now
will
process.
so,
it
would
process
any
election
or
representation
cases
of
the
union
so
that
in
effect,
this
--
the
--
the
injunction
of
the
court
of
appeals,
the
litigation
between
the
union
and
the
board
has
frustrated
--
had
been
frustrated
by
the
sixth
circuit
decision.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
1953
and
the
last
one
in
1954,
mr.
justice
black,
after
the
conviction
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
there
were
two
cases
in
the
district
of
columbia
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
two
in
1953
and
one
in
1954
after
the
conviction.
i
have
one
final
small
point
to
make.
i
understand
that
of
the
respondent,
lannom,
intends
to
argue
that
one
officer
of
the
union,
not
gold
but
another
or
was
not
in
--
hadn't
filed
the
necessary
9
(h)
affidavits,
and
therefore,
we
were
not
in
compliance
anyway.
now,
lannom
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
time
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
i
don't
believe
it's
material
to
an
issue
before
this
court
but
a
point
having
been
made
about
it,
i
would
say
that
the
record
at
pages
26,
27
and
28
will
show
that
the
board's
order
directs
the
reinstatement
of
24
workers
with
back
pay
and
not
of
five.
now,
i
think
section
9
(h)
has
been
perhaps
misread
with
regard
to
the
crucial
date,
the
jurisdictional
purposes
of
the
--
when
the
affidavits
must
be
on
file.
the
first
clause
talks
about
no
investigation
being
made
but
the
--
no
investigation
means,
no
investigation
concerning
representation
of
employees
under
subsection
(c)
which
means
in
the
words
of
art
of
the
statute
that
no
election
shall
be
held
unless
the
union
is
in
compliance.
and
with
regard
to
unfair
labor
practices,
no
complaint
shall
be
issued
so
that
the
critical
date
for
purposes
of
compliance
is
the
date
when
the
complaint
--
the
board
complaint
issues.
and
the
investigation
to
which
mr.
harwood
referred
was
an
investigation
concerning
representatives
id
and
election.
the
board's
argument
rests
entirely
on
the
position
as
i
understand
it
that
there
is
nothing
which
negates
the
board's
power
to
decomply
a
union
because
of
the
falsity
of
the
affidavit.
but
nothing
has
been
pointed
out
to
this
court
to
support
that
power
to
vest
--
to
visit
such
drastic
consequences
upon
the
union
and
such
destruction
of
labor
relation
with
the
one
exception
of
the
1953
subcommittee
report
of
the
senate
committee
on
labor.
now,
that
subcommittee
report
is
not,
by
definition,
part
of
the
legislative
history
and
all
that
that
report
amounts
to
was
an
expression
of
opinion
by
the
subcommittee
when
they
had
heard
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
our
case
that
they
sought
the
court
of
appeals
withdrawn.
now,
this
was
certainly
a
trespass
why
the
subcommittee
on
the
function
of
the
--
on
the
judicial
function
with
regard
to
interpreting
section
9
(h).
and
i
certainly
don't
think
it
supports
--
gives
any
support
to
the
board's
position.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
well
first,
i
think
judge
stewart
said
himself
that
that
assumption,
a
falsity
of
the
1951
affidavit
violates
substantive
due
process.
it
certainly
violates
the
presumption
of
innocence.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
well,
that's
the
point
i've
just
made,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
that
section
9
(h)
has
been
misread
because
the
critical
thing
here
is
the
date
when
the
board's
complaint
was
issued,
not
the
date
when
the
charge
was
filed.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
well
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
well,
i
don't
think
the
dant
case
passed
upon
that
question
at
all.
i
think
that
mr.
justice
reed
at
least
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
yes,
it
did.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
i
would
agree,
but
i
don't
think
it
--
it
never
--
what
it
did
was
to
state
to
assume
to
--
to
recite
the
board's
organization
in
this
regard.
it
did
not
have
that
question
before
it
for
a
decision
that
assume
that
the
--
that
the
rule
which
require
a
compliance
at
the
time
of
the
charge
was
valid
but
didn't
have
that
question
before
it
for
decision.
and
that
i
would
argue
if
i
had
to,
i
don't
think
i
reached
that
point
here.
that
the
board,
by
its
rules,
may
not
enlarge
upon
the
requirements
which
congress
had
set
for
achievement
of
the
compliance
status.
and
since
9
(h)
very
clearly
says
that
no
complaint
shall
issue
unless
at
the
time
that
the
complaint
is
issued
the
affidavit
is
on
file,
it's
improper
for
the
board
to
say,
“well,
we
want
you
to
be
in
compliance
not
only
when
the
complaint
issues
but
at
the
time
that
you
filed
the
charge
as
well.”
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
well
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
you
might
be
required
to
construe
it
if
you
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
yes,
but
you
might
be
required
to
consider
it
only
if
you
find
that
the
board
does
have
a
power
to
decomply
for
false
affidavit
that
it
--
that
it
may
do
so
pending
appeal
and
not
a
res
judicata
that
that
the
sixth
circuit
--
that
the
board
was
entitled
or
able
to
--
to
escape
the
sixth
circuit's
injunction
by
going
out
to
the
--
the
court
of
appeals,
the
district
of
columbia's
injunction
by
going
out
to
the
sixth
circuit
and
inviting
that
court
to
be
whether
of
the
injunction.
i
have
just
one
point
i
should
like
to
make
with
regard
to
the
question
that
was
put
by
mr.
justice
reed
to
mr.
kammholz
--
when
this
--
the
question
with
regard
to
what
is
the
board
to
do
to
determine
compliance
initially?
when
the
legislation
was
first
before
the
congress
in
1947,
the
bill
as
passed
said
--
made
the
fact
of
membership
in
the
communist
party,
the
test
of
compliance.
the
statute
3021,
--
h.r.
3021
said
that
no
union
which
has
communist
as
officers
--
communist
party
members
as
officers
shall
be
in
compliant.
that
was
debated
on
a
floor.
senator
ferguson
said,
“how
--
how
was
the
board
going
to
get
involved
in
whether
or
not
an
officer
of
the
union
is
a
--
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party?”
and
senator
mcclellan
said,
“well,
they
would
do
that
if
allegations
came
to
their
attention
that
he
was
a
communist
and
they
would
want
a
hearing
on
it.”
that
did
not
satisfy
the
situation.
that
is
precisely
what
they
wanted
to
get
away
from
to
have
these
hearings
by
the
board
with
regard
to
whether
john
doe,
an
officer
of
the
union
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
that's
where
the
conference
committee
came
up
with
it
solutions
to
this
problem,
had
him
file
an
affidavit.
if
the
affidavit
is
false,
you'll
go
to
jail
but
the
union
is
in
compliance.
that
is
the
--
that
was
the
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
well
--
well,
in
highland
park
and
coca-cola,
there
was
no
compliance.
the
unions
---
the
officers
of
the
union
had
not
filed.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
oh,
sure.
it's
perfectly
proper
to
say
that
the
officer
of
the
union
are
not
in
compliance
with
the
statutory
conditions
that
is
--
or
the
officers
have
not
filed.
here,
the
officers
have
filed
and
we
get
to
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
yes.
but
the
question
still
was
that
the
officers
had
not
filed.
there
as
the
court
said,
"not
all
of
the
officers
have
filed,
therefore,
you
are
not
in
compliance."
the
test
however
is
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
filing
by
all
of
the
officers.
the
test
is
not
--
congress
said
the
test
should
not
be
whether
or
not
the
officers
who
remember
the
communist
party.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
that's
right.
thank
you.
