mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
add
one
item
to
the
factual
statement
as
outlined
by
counsel
for
petitioner.
in
1954,
following
the
gold
conviction,
the
board
issued
in
order
to
show
cause
as
to
why
the
union
should
not
be
decomplied.
the
union
responded
to
that
proceeding
by
electing
gold
to
a
new
term
of
office
in
the
union.
thereupon,
the
board
did
issue
its
decompliance
order,
and
following
that,
the
proceedings
in
the
court
of
appeals
here
for
the
district
of
columbia
initially
in
the
district
court
were
undertaken.
we
submit
that
the
basic
question
here
presented
was
aptly
summarized
by
the
majority
below
in
these
words.
what
purports
to
be
an
affidavit
is
now
merely
a
piece
of
paper
evidencing
false
swearing.
certainly,
this
court
is
not
required
to
blindly
accept
the
form
and
ignore
the
realities.
considering
the
basic
congressional
intent
with
reference
to
9
(h)
requirements,
the
non-communist
affidavits,
we
think
the
--
the
wisdom
and
the
soundness
of
the
decision
below
is
amply
demonstrated.
in
the
highland
park
case
involving
the
basic
question
of
non-communist
affidavits
passed
on
here
in
1951,
this
court
said
this,
"to
grant
benefits
to
a
union,
one
of
whose
officers
is
an
undenied
communist,
certainly
frustrates
the
congressional
purpose
to
'wholly'
eradicate
and
bar
from
leadership
in
the
american
labor
movement
at
each
and
every
level
adherence
to
the
communist
party
and
believers
in
the
unconstitutional
overthrow
of
our
government."
now,
we
take
the
position
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
with
particular
reference
to
9
(h)
does
not
negate
the
power
of
the
board
to
decomply
in
circumstances
such
as
are
presented
in
this
case
or
to
put
it
another
way,
does
not
prevent
the
board
from
protecting
its
processes
from
abuse.
the
reference
to
senator
taft's
statement
by
counsel
read
in
context,
i
think,
relates
to
the
threshold
inquiry
which
both
the
senate
and
the
house
bill
initially
contemplated.
in
other
words,
a
requirement
that
in
each
instance
the
board
looked
into
the
compliance
status
of
the
union
before
it
might
declare
union
incompliance.
in
conference,
that
requirement
was
eliminated
and
we
submit
that
congressional
thought
on
that
subject
is
unrelated
to
the
problem
here
presented
which
is
one
of
protection
of
the
board's
processes
from
abuse
under
related
circumstances.
in
1953,
a
senate
subcommittee
--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
initially,
both
the
senate
and
the
house
bill
in
1947
would
have
required
the
board
in
each
instance
to
conduct
the
hearing
and
to
determine
whether
or
no,
the
--
the
officers
in
fact
were
properly
in
compliance
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
that
requirement
was
deleted.
in
place
of
it,
was
substituted
this
provision
for
the
filing
of
an
affidavit
by
the
officers
of
the
union
with
the
--
with
the
compliance
flowing
therefrom
if
properly
filed.
significant
in
this
connection
is
the
fact
that
the
--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes,
i
think
it
can
be
read,
your
honor,
as
going
farther,
but
i
don't
think
it
necessarily
cuts
the
ground
out
from
under
the
position
that
we're
asserting
here.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
but
the
statement
did
not
go
on
to
say
that
no
other
--
that
no
other
results
might
derive
therefrom.
i
think
the
emphasis
was
on
the
criminal
penalties
in
this
field
of
labor
management
relations.
it
seems
to
us
that
one
of
the
reasons
for
writing
it
into
the
law
was
to
make
it
abundantly
clear
to
all
who
might
file
affidavits
that
involved
here
were
criminal
penalties
quite
apart
from
what
else
might
be
involved.
this
matter
was
considered
by
a
senate
subcommittee
in
1953.
we
deal
with
that
subject
at
page
50
--
39
of
the
mine
mill
brief
which
covers
the
basic
problems
that
are
here
presented.
the
thrust
of
that
senate
subcommittee
statement
in
1953
was
precisely
the
position
that
we're
here
contending
for
that
of
course
the
board
did
have
authority
and
power
to
protect
its
processes
where
a
perjurious
affidavit
was
filed.
to
the
same
effect,
was
a
statement
by
the
chairman
of
the
board
before
this
same
committee.
so
in
essence,
this
matter
has
received
consideration
before
congressional
committee
granted
after
the
act
was
adopted
by
--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
the
conference
report?
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
i
think
not,
your
honor.
not
on
this
narrow
question,
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
this
has
not
been
the
attitude
of
the
board
from
the
outset.
there
has
been
a
change
--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes,
i
can
trace
it
in
this
case.
i
had
intended
to
go
into
some
detail.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
thank
you.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
fundamentally,
the
change
occurred
after
there
came
to
the
attention
of
the
board
evidence
of
false
affidavits
and
the
reconsideration
of
the
position
that
it
previously
been
taken.
i
think
in
summary,
the
board
--
the
board
position
can
be
stated
in
terms
of
a
comment
of
a
judge
wyzanski
of
the
first
circuit
recently
when
he
said
that
an
administrative
agency
is
expected
to
treat
experience
not
as
a
jailer
but
as
a
teacher.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
1953.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
1953.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
this
case
arose
of
course
in
an
unusual
context
and
that
the
problem
was
raised
before
the
court
of
appeals,
the
sixth
circuit.
there
have
been
quite
a
number.
i
would
venture
to
say
between
six
and
10
proceedings
in
which
--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
charge
was
filed
at
a
time
when
the
1950
affidavit
was
in
effect.
under
the
rules
of
the
agency,
as
recognized
by
this
court
in
dant
&
russell,
a
valid
affidavit
must
be
on
file
within
10
days
of
the
filing
of
that
charge
or
it
shall
be
dismissed.
so
here,
there
is
a
basis
for
attaching
significance
to
the
1950
affidavit
as
well
as
the
1951
affidavit
which
has
the
problem
that
was
touched
on
by
counsel
for
a
petitioner.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
gold
is
out
of
the
picture
now,
he
--
since
he
resigned,
but
there
was
his
second
affidavit,
the
1951
affidavit
as
to
which
the
conviction
did
--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
did
not
relate,
precisely.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
it
does,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
the
court
below
articulated
its
views
generally
speaking
in
this
--
in
this
form
that
in
view
of
the
nature
and
composition
of
the
communist
party,
its
unlikeness
to
any
other
political
party,
certain
inferences
and
presumptions
would
flow
from
the
falsity
of
the
1950
affidavit,
and
that
the
court
was
entitled
to
attach
a
presumption
of
continuing
falseness.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
no,
i
think
not,
your
honor,
i
think
not.
that
would
be
to
assert
--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
problems
of
bill
of
attainder
would
--
would
apply
here.
it's
not
a
question
of
once
a
communist
always
a
communist,
but
more
accurately,
i
would
say,
once
having
falsely
swear
that
presumption
flows
forward
at
least
for
a
time.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes,
unless
something
occurs
in
the
interim
to
--
to
change
that
presumption
and
there
is
nothing
on
this
record
to
so
indicate.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
well,
the
communist
party
is
one
that
as
mr.
justice
jackson
pointed
out,
is
a
party
of
secret
conclave.
it's
a
party
of
duplicity
if
i
may
use
that
expression.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes,
for
the
reason
that
nothing
had
occurred
in
the
interim
to
evidence
any
change
in
circumstances,
any
change
in
conditions
and
that
for
that
reason
alone,
the
presumption
would
follow.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
i
did.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
the
court
below
really
held
i
guess
that
once
having
been
convicted
as
gold
was,
a
burden
of
proof
attached
to
him
and
to
his
particular
circumstances
that
normally
would
not
apply.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
it's
a
difficult
point,
your
honor,
i
will
concede.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
i
would
draw
no
distinction
between
the
two,
your
honor.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
one
in
1950
and
one
in
1951.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
oh,
yes.
the
complaint
issue
that
the
time
of
the
1951
affidavit
was
on
file,
the
charge
had
been
filed
with
the
agency
during
the
--
the
efficacy
in
quotes
of
the
1950
affidavit.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
it
was
carried
over
sometime
elapsed
before
a
complaint
could
issue.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
an
affirmative
renunciation
i
think
would
be
one
method
of
affecting
the
result
that
we
assert
is
--
is
necessary
here.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
that's
not
sufficient.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
i
think
it
would
then
become
a
question
of
factual
determination
as
to
the
truth
or
falsity
of
that
renunciation.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
well,
i
suspected
the
inference
might
well
topple
fairly
readily,
your
honor,
but
some
presumption
carries
forward,
we
assert.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes,
subsequently,
gold
resigned,
someone
else
was
elected
and
the
union
is
now
in
compliance.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
that
occurred
in
1954
as
i
recall,
1954,
sir.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
from
1950
through
1951,
i
would
say,
on
the
basis
of
the
record
here.
we
have
not
been
confronted
with
any
question
as
to
his
subsequent
affidavits.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
there
is
a
continuing
obligation
on
the
board,
your
honor.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
to
--
for
the
purpose
of
checking
whether
or
no
labor
organizations
remain
in
compliance.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes,
an
affidavit
executed
with
--
contemporaneously
or
within
the
12-month
period
by
each
officer
and
so
forth.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
no,
they're
--
the
operations
of
the
agency,
your
honor,
are
not
self-implementing.
we
can
issue
complaint
only
if
a
charge
has
been
first
filed
--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
--
by
labor
organization
and
individual
employee
or
an
employer.
under
the
rules
of
the
agency,
if
there
is
compliance
with
the
affidavit
requirements
within
10
days
after
the
filing
of
the
charge,
we
consider
that
sufficient
and
proceed.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
that
charge
would
be
dismissed.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes.
our
position
is
that
we
find
that
it's
a
false
affidavit
that
then
we
should
be
entitled
to
dismiss
the
charge.
but
this
involves
the
problem
of
what
occurred
to
us
in
the
district
of
columbia,
both
the
district
court
and
court
of
appeals
where
we've
been
enjoined
from
looking
behind
the
affidavit
as
it
were.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes.
it
is
our
position
that
we
should
be
entitled
so
to
do
but
because
of
the
various
injunctions
that
have
issued
in
the
--
in
the
district
of
columbia,
we
are
not
currently
engaged
in
that
type
of
undertaking.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
it
does,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
he
was
speaking
at
that
time
of
threshold
inquiries
--
preliminary
inquiries
by
the
agency
to
determine
whether
or
no
it
would
place
a
union
in
compliance.
our
position
here
is
--
and
the
extent
of
position
simply
is
that
these
inquiries
may
be
conducted
contemporaneously.
and
there
is
no
automatic
lack
of
compliance
unless
and
until
the
board
certifies
or
in
an
administrative
proceeding
finds
specifically
that
a
given
union
has
failed
to
meet
the
statutory
requirements.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes,
your
honor,
after
full
hearing
with
opportunity
for
examination
--
cross-examination
--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
i
think
not.
i
think
not,
your
honor.
it
is
our
view
that
he
was
speaking
of
the
--
the
broad
situation
of
board
investigation
inquiry
in
each
and
every
instance
involving
the
numerous
unions
that
come
before
the
agency.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
i
concede
that
it
is.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes,
that
is
our
view.
of
course,
under
the
board's
proposed
procedure,
individual
case
processing
would
go
forward
until
a
final
determination
had
been
made
in
the
--
the
administrative
compliance
hearing.
so
it
seems
to
us
that
the
broad
statement
of
senator
taft
may
be
distinguished
from
what
the
agency
currently
contemplates.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
it
did.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes,
i
--
i
pointed
out
that
in
addition
to
the
basic
requirement
for
a
valid
--
a
valid
affidavit
on
file
at
the
time
complaint
issues
which
is
the
statutory
language,
the
board
has
tightened
its
rules
of
operation,
properly,
we
assert
as
recognized
by
this
court
in
dant
&
russel
and
has
--
has
imposed
the
further
requirement
that
in
addition
to
--
in
this
instance,
the
1951
affidavit
at
the
time
complaint
issued,
there
is
also
the
requirement
for
the
1950
affidavit
at
the
time
charge
is
filed.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
but
for
the
false
affidavit,
the
--
the
charge
would
have
been
dismissed
within
the
10-day
period.
that
is
our
position.
so
there
would
be
nothing
before
the
agency.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
or
to
put
it
another
way,
a
false
affidavit
is
as
no
affidavit
at
all
and
absent
an
affidavit
within
10
days
after
filing
of
charge,
we
dismiss.
we
don't
proceed.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
that
ought
to
be
enough.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
precisely.
or
to
put
it
another
way,
we've
--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
that
is
precisely
our
contention,
yes.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
precisely.
although
we
do
in
--
in
the
--
with
reference
to
the
broad
administration
of
the
statute,
we
contend
for
the
broader
position.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
this,
your
honor,
is
referred
to
in
n.l.r.b.
against
dant
&
russel.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
9
(h).
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
9
(h),
yes.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes.
and
the
court
here
dealt
with
that
problem
in
n.l.r.b.
versus
dant,
344,
375.
we
referred
to
it
in
a
number
of
places
in
our
brief.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
harwood
has
15
minutes
and
if
i
may,
i
should
like
to
--
