mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
cammer,
where
do
i
find
that
language
of
mr.
--
of
senator
taft
that
you
have
just
--
that
you
have
just
stated?
chief
justice
earl
warren
13
of
your
brief.
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
we'd
rather
finish
that
after
lunch.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
proceed
mr.
cammer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
mr.
kammholz.
chief
justice
earl
warren
has
this
attitude
of
the
board
been
consistent
since
the
act
came
into
effect?
has
it
always
taken
that
attitude
or
has
there
been
a
change?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mind
tracing
that
for
us
just
to
--
briefly
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
may
do
it
then
the
other
one
initially.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
it
the
present
position
of
the
--
the
board
that
it
--
it
can
whenever
it
sees
fit,
inquire
into
the
truth
of
any
affidavit
of
this
kind
through
an
administrative
proceeding?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
flows
from
your
present
position
in
this
state
that
--
in
this
case
that
you
believe
you
have
the
right
to
do
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
how
would
that
comport
with
the
position
of
senator
taft
when
he
--
when
he
said
the
purpose
of
this
was
to
prevent
delay
in
--
in
these
matters
that
are
--
that
come
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
a
compliant
is
made
by
union
against
an
employer
and
the
employer
or
someone
else
brings
information
to
your
attention
to
the
effect
that
the
affidavit
was
not
true.
it's
your
position
that
the
board
has
a
right
down
there
to
go
into
the
matter
to
determine
and
if
it
finds
that
in
its
judgment
that
the
affidavit
was
false,
may
declare
the
union
out
of
--
out
of
conformance.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
think
that
was
the
thing
that
senator
taft
was
trying
to
avoid
in
--
in
this
language
rather
than
that
which
was
put
in
the
senate
originally?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
pretty
broad
language
--
pretty
broad
language
in
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
under
the
amendment
and
affidavit
as
sufficient
for
the
board's
purposes
and
there
is
no
delay
unless
an
officer
of
the
moving
union
refuses
to
file
the
affidavit
required.
and
he
says
that
it
will
not
hold
up
the
certification
of
the
union
with
any
communist
to
--
to
make
a
false
affidavit
when
we
sent
him
to
jail.
do
you
think
it
was
only
a
threshold
question
that
he
was
talking
about
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
they
did
operate
on
that
theory.
the
board
operated
under
that
theory
from
1947
to
1953.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
harwood.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
where
is
that
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
government
brief
page
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
say
it
was
false?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
he
--
is
he
charged
here
with
believing
that
he
make
an
affidavit
but
he
didn't
believe
in
constitutional
or
communist
principles
or
did
he
make
an
affidavit
that
he
didn't
belong
to
a
party?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
what
did
the
act
--
what
did
it
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
now,
that's
far
--
that's
far
enough
and
in
this
statement
that
you've
quoted,
he
said
that
he
--
he
resigned
in
order
to
be
in
technical
compliance
but
that
he
still
believed
in
communist
principles.
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
is
that
--
does
that
conflict
with
the
--
with
the
affidavit?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
it
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
you
may
answer
the
question,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
cammer.
