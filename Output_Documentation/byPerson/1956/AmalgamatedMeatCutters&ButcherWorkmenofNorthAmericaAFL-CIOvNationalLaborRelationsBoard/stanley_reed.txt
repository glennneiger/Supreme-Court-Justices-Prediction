all
the
activities
relate
to
the
1951
or
1952,
and
therefore,
depend
on
the
1951
affidavit?
justice
stanley
reed
now,
is
it
your
--
it's
your
contention
the
1950
affidavit
is
immaterial?
justice
stanley
reed
and
there
is
no
question
that
if
there
had
been
a
true
affidavit
for
1951,
then
that
particularly
would
have
been
overcome
if
he
had
shown
that.
justice
stanley
reed
what
do
you
--
what
do
you
mean
with
saying
under
submission
on
the
initial
compliance
if
the
board
was
to
look
to
see
whether
the
--
the
paper
has
been
signed?
justice
stanley
reed
taft
stated
farther
that
this
is
supported
by
your
opponent
and
said
this
will
be
left
to
punishment
by
criminal
proceeding?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
perhaps
not,
but
i
--
i
don't
think
the
fact
that
it
was
a
different
form
of
bill
would
make
any
difference,
would
it?
because
this
was
a
question
of
how
the
compliance
would
be
shown
from
the
start.
it
was
said
if
they
haven't
been
any
compliance,
reads
like
a
false
affidavit
will
be
punished
only
by
criminal
proceedings.
justice
stanley

the
conference
show.
justice
stanley
reed
does
the
conference
report
show
anything
about
this?
on
the
taft-hartley.
justice
stanley
reed
was
the
--
justice
stanley
reed
do
you
draw
a
distinction
between
the
case
that
already
has
been
convicted
and
where
it's
been
found
by
administrative
proceedings
that
it
is
false?
justice
stanley
reed
9
--
9
(h)
seems
to
fly
only
to
the
preliminary
start,
any
prior
to
the
time
it
is
filed.
is
that
your
interpretation
of
it?
justice
stanley
reed
where
does
that
arise?
justice
stanley
reed
yes,
but
9
--
9
(h),
no
investigations
shall
be
made
unless
there
is
on
file
with
the
board.
justice
stanley
reed
yes,
but
there
is
none
there.
it
hasn't
been
for
12
months
when
the
--
when
this
is
filed
and
you
can't
cure
that,
can
you,
when
--
when
it's
filed?
suppose
complaints
filed
on
january
the
10th,
1950
and
there's
nothing
there
since
january
10th,
1949.
and
you
would
go
ahead
and
process
it
by
filing
a
little
later.
justice
stanley
reed
that's
right.
justice
stanley
reed
well,
now
you
--
you
filed
on
the
11th
(inaudible)
justice
stanley
reed
or
you
can
find
out
whether
the
false
affidavit
would
be
dismissed
(voice

justice
stanley

mr.
kammholz
--
justice
stanley
reed
in
--
in
answer
to
this
question
a
while
ago,
related
the
affidavit
to
the
charge
rather
than
to
the
compliant,
you
related
that
the
filing
of
the
affidavit
to
the
time
of
the
charge
rather
than
to
the
time
of
filing
the
complaint.
but
the
statute
talks
about
that
with
no
investigation
and
no
complaint
unless
there
shall
be
--
unless
there
is
on
file
with
the
board
an
affidavit
excluded
contemporaneously
or
within
the
record.
isn't
that
contemporaneously
with
the
complaint?
justice
stanley
reed
and
therefore,
you
wouldn't
think
if
a
true
affidavit
was
--
was
filed
at
the
time
that
is
required
and
before
the
complaint
that
--
that
that
would
be
enough?
do
you
--
can
--
can
you
--
oh,
no,
you
wouldn't
say
that
you
would
cling
to
the
false
affidavit
after
true
affidavit
is
filed.
justice
stanley
reed
well
--
justice
stanley
reed
that's
all
clear
enough
but
we
get
two
affidavits
within
the
period
and
in
--
contemporaneously
with
the
complaint,
that
ought
to
be
enough.
justice
stanley
reed
well,
this
would
mean
that
in
--
in
every
proceeding,
the
board
would
have
the
authority
at
least
to
enter
into
a
full-scale
investigation
as
to
whether
the
affidavits
had
been
properly
made?
justice
stanley
reed
but
it
turned
out
that
they
were
false,
regardless
of
whether
the
union
knew
about
it
or
not
and
the
whole
proceeding
would
be
set
aside.
justice
stanley
reed
that
it's
got
the
jurisdiction
anyway?
justice
stanley
reed
yes,
but
you
--
even
if
you
had
completed
the
entire
procedure
but
the
board
hadn't
completed
the
entire
procedure,
it
was
later
--
later
found
out
that
there
had
been
a
false
affidavit,
they
wouldn't
have
jurisdiction.
justice
stanley
reed
the
affidavit
says
that
he
does
not
believe
in
and
he's
not
a
member
of
supporting
the
organization.
justice
stanley
reed
is
the
highland
park
the
only
case
to
this
--
discussed
this
matter
in
this
court?
justice
stanley
reed
what
--
what
are
you
going
to
say
about
the
highland
park
and
coca-cola
(inaudible)
justice
stanley
reed
but
it
raised
the
question
of
compliance
whether
--
justice
stanley
reed
well,
if
in
one
of
those
cases,
hadn't
the
officer
filed
and
he
said
he
wasn't
an
officer
or
some
--
someone
who
wasn't
a
--
but
if
the
dispute
is
given
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
stanley
reed
whether
they
told
the
truth
or
not?
