justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
there
was
a
discharge,
mr.
cammer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
--
i
don't
suppose
there
is
--
as
yet
there
is
an
order
of
reinstatement.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
with
back
pay?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
--
that's
my
question.
what
is
the
basis
upon
which
(inaudible)
relates
very
well
to
the
present
case
and
to
which
i
understand
is
also
(inaudible)
signed
by
gold.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
not
relate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
decompliance
covers
the
period
from
1951
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
the
defendants
say,
one
might
be
defaulted.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
what's
left
of
the
sworn
falsehood
if
(inaudible)
substantly
when
they
took
an
oath
in
the
office.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
i
won't
see
the
effects
of
that
based
on
our
knowledge
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
view
it
on
that
(inaudible)
an
affidavit
executed
and
followed
here
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
he
affirmatively
renounced
the
--
that
is
stated
in
the
affidavit,
i
did
on
such
in
such
a
day
will
quit
my
membership
in
the
party
not
withstanding
his
conviction
for
false
swearing
of
what
that
statement,
they
accepted
us
to?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
strikes
me
as
not
carrying
very
far
than
the
inference
of
--
one
is
not
telling
the
truth
and
the
fact
that
he's
previously
been
convicted
of
having
sworn
falsity.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
is
the
union
presently
in
compliance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
has
--
has
that
been
fairly
recently
or
is
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
the
decompliance
relates
then
only
what,
from
1950
to
1954?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
harwood,
am
i
correct
in
this?
the
complaint
issued
when
the
affidavit
for
his
false
swearing
to
which
he
was
convicted
was
functus
by
passage
of
times.
after
all
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
at
the
time
of
the
complaint
issued
or
did
it
issue?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
that
time,
there
was
another
affidavit
on
file.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
there
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
event
there
has
never
been
a
--
in
any
place,
has
there
a
formal
determination
that
that
affidavit
was
false?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
this
that
at
time
the
complaint
issue,
there
was
in
fact
an
affidavit.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
9
(h)
--
if
9
(h)
applies,
it
has
to
be
on
the
basis
that
--
that
affidavit
may
also
be
treated
merely
as
a
scrap
of
paper.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
you
feel
the
conclusion
below
may
be
supported
without
getting
to
the
questions
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
1951
affidavit.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
is
that
to
read
9
(h)
as
you
pointed
out
before,
its
language
is
conjunctive.
first,
investigation
and
then
--
then
a
complaint
as
meaning
that
on
both
of
those
occasions
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
there
must
be
a
valid
affidavit.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
the
back
pay,
mr
--
