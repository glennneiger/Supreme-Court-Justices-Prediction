in
what
therefore,
you
draw
the
inference
that
you
agree
with
the
government
as
its
case
shouldn't
be
decided,
i
feel
bad
if
we
just
to
dispose
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
--
if
your
argument
is
relevant,
then
one
must
draw
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
it
would
follow.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
in
any
event
unless
one
is
with
you
and
reestablish
towards
construction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
maybe
--
that
maybe
it
would
--
you
don't
get
to
that
point,
we
will
get
to
it.
but
if
you
do
get
to
it
and
it
does
not
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
might
hold
that
up
too.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
that's
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
merely
suggesting.
i
am
more
sympathetic
with
your
argument.
it
is
fair
that
to
shed
light
on
what
is
involved
and
to
say
it
ultimately
shouldn't
be
read
until
the
gold
case
is
as
full.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
that's
sort
of
taking
away
from
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
what
--
is
it
--
what
would
you
ask?
i
don't
know
what
it
is,
what
the
present
situation
in
this
labor
controversy
is
whether
we're
talking
about
something
that
feel
actually
alive?
justice
felix
frankfurter
certainly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
alternative?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
that's
operating
to
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
kammholz,
you
--
you
used
a
phrase
i
think
of
what
de
novo
a
communist
party
is
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
see
a
differentiation
must
be
taken.
we're
going
to
take
judicial
notice
because
i
think
you
can
in
some
(inaudible)
we
also
note
that
affiliation,
the
kind
of
a
floating
powers,
and
people
change
unlike
the
old
judges,
doesn't
know
the
mind
in
that
if
ever
it
doesn't.
but
we
do
know
that
people
disaffiliate
for
all
sorts
of
reasons
if
decision
numbers
could
make
that
inference
or
around
that
line
of
assumptions.
whatever
may
be
the
continuity
of
the
party
says
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
think
it
--
you
think
it's
strange
reasoning
that
how
he's
been
convicted,
he
might
have
thought
about
it
and
changed
his
mind
about
his
affiliation?
i'm
not
saying
it's
true.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
i
don't
see
in
the
realm
of
fair
inference
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
government's
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
harwood,
you
said
there
were
some
amendatory
charges.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
knows
that
--
can
one
say
--
can
say
automatically
that
those
amendments
did
not
--
bring
the
date
of
the
charge
down
to
the
date
of
the
amend
--
amended
filing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
six
months,
it
doesn't
matter
what
amendments
you
make.
the
initial
date
is
the
controlling
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
commenting
in
mr.
kammholz's
comments
on
judge
stewart's
dissent
to
wit
the
laborer
affidavit
checked
note
that
--
take
into
account
of
eight
affidavits?
but
they
only
have
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
kammholz's
argument
was
that
you
don't
have
to
go
to
that
aspect.
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
is
both
and
he
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
he
vouches
the
dant
case
for
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
discussed
it
and
analyzed
to
discuss
the
structure
of
9
(h).
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
in
connection
with
that,
i
don't
think
you
did
very
well
to
say
what
it
said
about
it
in
particular
because
it
had
to
consider
them,
totality
of
the
section.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
do
you
say
that
we
have
to
pass
--
but
if
it
wasn't
passed
on
the
dant,
we
are
now
required
to
consider?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
construe
the
first
part
with
the
investigation
of
9
(h).
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
if
--
if
that's
the
basis,
construe
it
in
a
sense.
