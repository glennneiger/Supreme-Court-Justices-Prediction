were
the
--
was
the
board's
investigation
of
the
false
affidavit
tried
in
the
unfair
labor
practice
proceedings
or
in
a
--
in
a
separate
administrative
proceedings
in
the
--
the
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
thinking
about
the
case
that's
coming
afterward
necessary.
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
officer
of
a
union
is
called
as
a
witness
in
the
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
as
he
was
asked
whether
he's
filing
non-communist
affidavit.
and
then
he
has
a
change
of
heart
and
he
says,
"yes,
but
i
lied
when
--
when
i
filed
that
affidavit."
does
the
board
have
to
proceed
because
the
affidavits
on
file
or
can
it
treat
that
as
a
basis
for
decompliance?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
have
to
go
ahead.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that
makes
the
non-communist
affidavit
sort
of
a
filing
process
rather
than
having
any
substance
to
it,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
the
thing
that
congress
was
concerned
with
was
--
now,
mr.
cammer,
was
the
slowing
up
of
certification
proceedings
by
having
the
board
embarking
on
the
sort
of
a
side
issue
of
investigating
claims
of
perjury.
wasn't
that
the
thing
that
led
to
the
--
final
compromise
between
the
senate
committee
and
the
house
committee
in
substituting
this
affidavit
procedure
for
--
what
the
house
bill
had
originally
proposed,
namely,
that
there
was
to
be
an
administrative
investigation?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
the
unfair
labor
practice
charge
filed
in
1950
is
distinguished
in
the
complaint
issue?
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
still
alive,
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
as
you
mean.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
was
it,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
statute
different?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
as
i
understood
your
argument
or
your
answer
to
justice
burton's
question,
it
is
in
effect
that
although
the
act
only
requires
an
affidavit
on
file
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
complaint,
still
is
an
administrative
matter.
the
board
has
undertaken
to
extend
that
period
to
relate
back
10
days
after
the
filing
of
the
charge.
and
that
there's
no
limitation
in
the
act
that
would
prevent
the
board
in
its
administrative
matter
from
doing
that,
is
that
your
argument?
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
that
is
so,
then
there
would
have
to
be
an
affidavit,
a
good
affidavit
on
file
for
the
entire
period
from
the
filing
of
the
charge
or
the
10
days
after
the
filing
of
the
charge
in
accordance
with
the
board
rule
up
through
the
period
to
the
filing
of
the
complaint.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
that
would
make
the
1950
affidavit
on
that
argument
a
relevant
and
material
and
necessary
consideration.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
that
you
would
not
be
standing
simply
on
the
1951
affidavit.
that's
your
argument.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understand.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
the
practice,
the
actual
practice
of
the
board
in
that
respect?
do
they
refuse
to
investigate
and
that's
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
determination
on
the
file?
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
refused.
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
do.
