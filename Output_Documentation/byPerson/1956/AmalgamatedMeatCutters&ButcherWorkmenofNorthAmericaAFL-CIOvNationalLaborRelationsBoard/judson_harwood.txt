mr.
judson
harwood
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
judson
harwood
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
do
so,
i
would
like
to
make
a
few
remarks
regarding
the
question
that
you
want
to
ask
the
counsel
for
the
board.
if
you
will
read
section
9
(h)
in
view
of
the
actual
administration
of
the
act,
9
(h)
says
no
investigation
shall
be
--
mr.
judson
harwood
now,
that's
9
(h),
i'm
reading
from
the
act.
it
is
not
--
it
is
not
copied
in
my
brief,
not
only
but
it's
in
the
record.
mr.
judson
harwood
it's
in
the
government's
brief
--
mr.
judson
harwood
--
but
i'm
reading
from
another
volume.
i
think
i'll
find
it
in
the
government's
brief.
mr.
judson
harwood
but
anyway,
the
--
the
act
says
no
investigation
shall
be
made
by
the
board
of
any
question
affecting
commerce.
the
representation
of
employees
raised
by
labor
organizations
under
subsection
(c),
no
petition
under
section
9
(e)
shall
be
unattained
and
no
complaint
shall
be
issued
unless
the
affidavit
and
so
forth
is
on
file.
now,
the
section
10
of
the
act
provides
that
no
--
no
charge
may
be
filed
or
entertained
after
the
passage
of
six
months
from
the
occurrence
of
the
events
relied
upon
in
the
charge.
now,
the
--
when
a
charge
is
filed,
the
filing
of
the
charge
puts
into
operation
the
board's
machinery
of
making
the
investigation.
it
says
no
investigation
shall
be
made
because
when
a
charge
is
filed,
the
board
then
investigates
whether
there
is
merit
to
the
charge
sufficient
to
justify
the
issuance
of
a
complaint.
so
without
a
--
the
required
affidavit
on
file
or
in
this
case,
without
something
more
than
a
scrap
of
paper
evidencing
false
swearing,
the
board
was
prohibited
from
even
investigating
the
charge.
therefore,
the
1950
affidavit
is
quite
material.
now,
it
is
important
to
remember
that
the
events
alleged
as
the
basis
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
occurred
in
february
of
1951.
the
first
affidavit
was
filed
in
august
1950,
so
that
was
during
the
effective
period
of
the
1950
affidavit.
now,
it
is
true
that
there
were
two
or
three
minor
amended
charges
filed,
but
the
first
two
were
filed
during
the
period
of
the
1950
affidavit.
the
other
two
amendments
were
filed
after
the
elapse
of
the
six-month
statute
of
limitations
for
filing
a
charge.
so,
for
the
last
two
charges
to
be
considered
at
all,
they
had
to
be
considered
under
the
relating
back
theory
and
attached
to
it
and
become
a
part
of
the
original
charge.
now,
the
original
charge,
therefore,
was
filed
during
the
effective
date
of
gold's
1950
affidavit.
and
if
the
board
was
prohibited
under
9
(h)
from
even
investigating
the
merits
of
that
charge,
then
of
course,
the
--
there
--
because
there
was
no
affidavit
that
court,
we
think,
decides
the
issue.
now,
the
fact
that
the
only
effect
as
i
see
it
of
the
1951
affidavit
is
that
there
must
also
be
on
file
an
affidavit
before
a
complaint
can
issue.
but
in
this
case,
before
this
case
could
properly
be
investigated
and
a
complaint
issued
from
the
calendar
standpoint,
it
was
necessary
for
two
affidavits
to
have
been
on
file.
one,
to
effect
or
to
put
into
operation
the
board's
investigative
machinery,
and
since
the
board's
investigation
took
so
long
or
for
some
other
reason,
it
ran
over
until
the
next
affidavit
was
required
under
the
statute,
there
must
be
a
second
affidavit
before
the
complaint
could
issue.
mr.
judson
harwood
if
--
if
all
--
mr.
judson
harwood
if
the
affidavit
is
not
on
file
at
the
time
the
charge
is
made
or
within
10
days
thereafter
--
mr.
judson
harwood
--
they
dismiss
the
charge.
mr.
judson
harwood
now
in
this
instance,
they
assumed
that
there
was
a
valid
affidavit
on
file.
they
had
no
evidence
to
the
contrary,
at
least,
as
far
as
this
record
is
concerned.
i
offered
to
prove
that
they
did
but
i
don't
believe
that
--
and
it's
quoted
in
the
appendix
to
my
brief,
but
i
don't
believe
its
material
here.
so
the
1950
affidavit
must
be
valid
in
order
for
any
of
the
board's
operations
to
have
been
invalid
under
the
act.
mr.
judson
harwood
the
only
involved
aiding
or
deleting
a
name
is
the
only
difference.
mr.
judson
harwood
no,
sir,
because
if
your
honor
--
if
you
bring
it
down
to
that
date,
it's
barred
by
the
six-month
statute
of
limitations
contained
in
section
10
of
the
act.
section
10
of
the
act
provides
that
they
can't
issue
a
complaint
or
can't
entertain
a
charge
filed
more
than
six
months
after
the
occurrence
of
the
events
which
are
related
in
the
charge.
and
both
of
the
amended
charges
--
mr.
judson
harwood
the
initial
date
is
controlling.
now,
we
don't
question
the
effect
of
the
amendments
because
the
courts
have
held
that
they
relate
back
to
and
become
a
part
of
the
original
charge.
so,
we
think
that
the
--
actually,
the
difference
between
the
1950
and
the
1951
affidavits
has
really
no
difference
at
all.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
in
discussing
that
particular
issue,
we
think,
and
i'm
reading
from
the
page
19
and
the
20
of
the
record.
we
think
it
acted
properly
and
in
say
--
your
sound
judgments.
there's
in
the
absence
of
a
showing
to
the
contrary.
the
reasonable
presumption
would
be
continuing
membership
in
such
an
organization
rather
than
withdraw.
and
then
over
on
page
20,
they
quote
from
a
sixth
circuit
case,
united
states
--
hoffman
versus
united
states.
we
recognized
the
--
in
this
case
the
probability
and
possibility
of
a
change
of
allegiance
or
affiliation
on
the
part
of
a
member
of
the
party
particularly
if
the
proof
of
status
is
confined
to
a
time
remote
from
the
date
of
the
offense
charge.
i
just
heard
an
argument
about
1935
with
which
would
neurologically
apply
that.
but
we
rejected
the
contention
that
membership
in
the
communist
party
on
a
certain
day
could
be
proved
only
by
evidence
of
what
happened
or
transpired
on
that
day.
so,
we
think
that
if
the
--
mr.
judson
harwood
there
the
--
from
the
complaint
standpoint.
yes,
sir.
mr.
judson
harwood
it
did
issue.
mr.
judson
harwood
there
was
another
affidavit.
there's
another
piece
of
paper
on
file,
i
would
say.
mr.
judson
harwood
there's
no
showing
--
mr.
judson
harwood
no,
sir.
the
--
there
has
not
to
my
knowledge,
although
there
in
the
disposition
of
the
1950
affidavit,
the
--
which
is
not
in
this
record
except
as
an
offer
of
proof.
at
the
time
of
deciding
of
the
1950
affidavit,
mr.
gold
called
a
press
conference.
and
as
this
is
merely
an
offer
of
proof
which
was
rejected
by
the
board
but
i
have
quoted
in
my
appendix,
mr.
gold
at
the
time
he
signed
it
made
a
press
release
wherein
he
stated,
"his
actions
were
taken
for
the
purpose
of
technical
compliance
with
the
taft-hartley
act
and
that
it
did
it
not
involve
any
renunciation
of
his
belief
in
communist
principles.‚Äù
mr.
judson
harwood
there
was
--
mr.
judson
harwood
i
don't
think
that
you
--
your
court
has
to
reach
that
position
in
disposing
of
this
case.now,
the
union's
position
in
the
future
is
not
here.
it's
only
involving
for
a
short
period
of
time.
but
the
--
as
counsel
for
the
board
has
pointed
out,
the
board
under
the
statute
cannot
issue
a
complaint
except
upon
the
filing
of
a
valid
charge
which
must
be
filed
within
six
months
of
the
events
alleged
to
constitute
unfair
labor
practices.
mr.
judson
harwood
yes
sir.
mr.
judson
harwood
yes
sir,
because
the
--
there
could
be
no
complaint
issued
except
upon
a
valid
charge
and
no
charge
was
filed
within
the
six
months
period
except
--
oh,
within
10
days
thereafter
except
based
upon
the
1950
affidavit.
mr.
judson
harwood
that's
true.
mr.
judson
harwood
yes,
sir.
that
is
our
position
and
the
board's
position
which
this
court
has
affirmed
is
that
the
actual
filing
of
the
charge
may
initiate
the
board's
machinery
if
the
affidavit
is
filed
within
10
days.
now,
i
don't
know
what
would
happen.
this
is
--
if
the
charge
were
filed
in
six
months
and
25
--
five
months
and
25
days
after
the
event
occurred
and
then
the
affidavit
was
filed
10
days
later,
that
question
is
not
here
and
i
haven't
looked
into
it
but
that
is
not
the
material
here.
so
we
think
that
--
and
i
--
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief
that
the
dissenting
opinion
by
judge
stewart
can
--
is
really
of
no
importance
if
you
look
at
the
statute
with
that
in
light.
now,
the
--
to
get
the
history
straight,
the
--
the
acts
--
the
affidavit
was
filed
in
1950
in
august.
the
acts
alleged
as
the
basis
were
--
occurred
in
february
of
1951.
the
complaint
didn't
issue
until
february
1952.
and
of
course,
february
1951
was
within
a
year
of
august
1950.
and
--
and
one
other
point
on
that.
there
is
no
claim
in
this
record
anywhere
that
the
board
or
that
the
union
in
anyway
attempted
to
treat
the
1951
affidavit
as
putting
this
in
compliance
when
we
were
not
in
compliance
in
1950.
there's
nothing
here
to
indicate
that
there
was
a
change
in
compliance
status.
now,
as
counsel
has
already
pointed
out,
the
union
responded
to
their
show-cause
order
by
reelecting
gold
president
after
he
was
convicted.
so,
you're
not
imposing
a
penalty
on
a
bunch
of
dukes,
if
i
may
use
that
expression.
they
knew
what
was
going
on
and
he
was
reelected.
but
he
--
since
his
conviction,
he
has
resigned
and
the
--
after
his
resignation,
the
union
is
in
compliance.
now,
i'd
like
to
touch
briefly
on
one
other
point
that
i
didn't
think
it
was
material
but
it's
only,
justice
frankfurter
asked
counsel
for
the
petitioner
regarding
the
present
status.
the
present
status
is
not
in
this
record.
the
employees
--
first
place,
the
board
ordered
five
employees,
reinstated.
it
didn't
order
28.
it
held
that
the
respondent
discharged
20,
some
odd
employees
justifiably,
but
five
of
them
were
out
of
seniority.
actually
and
practically,
all
of
them
are
working
for
this
company
now.
but
there's
been
no
posting
of
a
notice
as
the
board
ordered
and
there
has
been
no
recognition
that
anything
wrong
was
done
by
the
petitioner.i
wouldn't
have
mentioned
that
except
for
as
i
interpreted
the
question
put
by
justice
--
mr
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
judson
harwood
there
--
there
has
been
no
back
pay
paid.
we
think
and
--
mr.
judson
harwood
there
was
an
order
as
to
five.
actually,
we
think
that
even
on
the
merits,
we
can
win
three
of
those
without
--
because
of
no
evidence
and
there
is
a
conflict
of
evidence
on
two
which
i'm
sure
would
be
binding
on
the
sixth
circuit
on
that
point,
but
that
is
not
before
here
but
they
are
working
now.
if
i
might
take
just
a
moment,
the
government
restricted
the
use
of
hides
at
this
period
of
the
time
and
cut
off
this
company's
raw
materials
and
that
was
the
basis
for
a
large
reduction
in
force.
and
the
board
has
held
in
its
order
that
that
was
the
justifiable
reduction
but
they
didn't
they
agree
with
the
matter
in
which
it
was
made.
now,
if
i
may
proceed
just
on
one
other
point.
we
think
that
the
sixth
circuit's
opinion
and
i
--
we
have
to
care
for
consideration.
i
didn't
believe
that
i
could
improve
on
it
by
averting
the
court
with
further
brief.
it
quotes
from
this
court's
decisions,
we
think
very
effectively
from
the
case
of
the
highland
park
manufacturing
company.
and
we
think
that
the
clear
intent
of
congress
was,
as
this
court
stated
in
that
case,
to
wholly
eradicate
and
bar
from
leadership
in
the
american
labor
movement
at
each
in
every
level
adherence
to
the
communist
party.
now,
here
is
a
union
whose
president
files
a
false
affidavit
and
he's
reelected
to
office.
he's
indicted
and
reelected
and
he's
convicted
and
he's
again
reelected.
certainly,
the
congressional
purpose
in
the
whole
policy
of
labor-management
relations
could
not
be
effectuated
if
this
matter
were
to
proceed.
now,
just
to
take
a
--
an
illustration
a
little
further,
suppose
that
mr.
gold
had
been
indicted
and
had
pleaded
guilty
to
the
charge,
his
conviction
would
be
filed.
then
suppose
that
the
union
reelects
him
to
president
--
to
the
office
of
president
and
suppose
he
goes
right
out
and
files
another
affidavit
but
at
the
time,
he
says
it's
false,
but
i'm
in
jail,
i
just
will
stay
here.
certainly,
the
board
would
not
be
bound
to
ignore
the
realities.
now,
we
have
one
other
point
that
this
action
by
the
sixth
circuit
is
not
an
administrative
action.
this
is
an
action
by
a
branch
of
the
judiciary.
and
certainly,
as
that
court
so
clearly
pointed
out
in
its
opinion
that
it
is
not
required
to
close
its
--
as
to
reality
and
even
though
the
board
as
an
administrative
agency
may
not
have
the
authority
to
look
into
this
matter.
certainty,
a
court
when
called
upon
to
enforce
the
order,
can
apply
ordinary
judicial
press
codes
and
denial
relief
when
these
facts
are
in
the
record
without
dispute.
now,
i
would
take
the
board's
position,
if
i
may,
one
step
further
and
state
this,
that
while
the
board
is
administrative
in
a
lot
of
its
functions,
its
judicial
or
at
least
quasi-judicial
in
many
of
its
functions.
and
from
time
in
memorial,
courts
have
inherently
had
power
to
protect
their
own
processes
from
abuse.
and
we
think
that
in
exercising
at
least
quasi-judicial
actions,
even
the
board
would
be
authorized
to
protect
itself
from
what
we
would
consider
ridiculous
abuse.
mr.
judson
harwood
if
the
court
please,
i
don't
think
that
that
would
necessarily
follow
as
counsel
for
the
board
has
pointed
out.
if
the
affidavits
are
on
file
and
the
board
should
receive
information
that
led
it
to
be
believe
that
they
were
false.
that
pending
the
investigation
of
the
falsity,
the
union's
petitions
and
so
forth
would
be
processed
because
it
would
be
in
compliance
until
or
after
a
hearing
and
in
affirmative
finding
that
it
was
false.
so
the
union
wouldn't
be
penalized
pending
the
investigation.
mr.
judson
harwood
well,
i
don't
necessarily
say
i
--
if
--
if
they
were
closed,
certainly,
they
would
not,
but
whether
they
were
still
pending
and
it
developed
that
they
were
clearly
false,
why
i
would
think
that
it
would
go
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
judson
harwood
i
think
the
compliance
status
does
go
to
jurisdiction.
i
think
this
court
has
so
held
in
coca-cola.
mr.
judson
harwood
i
don't
think
it
would
go
quite
that
far,
if
your
honor
please.
the
--
the
board's
--
if
the
board
had
certified
a
union,
for
instance,
as
bargaining
agent,
this
union,
we'll
say
in
1950
and
an
employer
had
been
dealing
with
him
during
this
period
of
time.
now,
they
have
removed
gold.
they
are
still
the
certified
bargaining
agent
but
there
was
a
period
in
there
when
if
it
had
become
necessary,
they
would
have
not
been
entitled
to
the
board's
--
the
--
the
--
as
i
understand
it,
congress
did
not
intend
to
lend
the
aid
of
the
government
to
the
furtherance
of
unions
that
were
dominated
by
communist.
and
that
would
be
the
result
if
a
man
is
permitted
to
file
a
scrapbook
paper
and
tell
the
court
in
substance.
it's
false
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it.
that's
practically
what
gold
did
in
this
case,
that
it
--
he
--
because
he
issued
a
press
release
stating
that
it
was
false.
i
--
i
don't
--
i'm
not
in
the
criminal
case.
i
know
nothing
about
it
but
i
assume
that
was
at
least
part
of
the
basis
for
his
conviction.
mr.
judson
harwood
well,
his
press
release
stated
that
it
did
not
in
anyway
result
or
reflect
in
any
denunciation
of
his
belief
in
communist
principles
or
words
to
that
effect.
mr.
judson
harwood
he
made
the
affidavit
as
required
by
the
act,
but
simultaneously
--
mr.
judson
harwood
well,
the
act
requires
--
i'd
have
to
read
it,
your
honor,
that
he
is
not
a
member
of
the
communist
--
mr.
judson
harwood
--
party
and
doesn't
--
mr.
judson
harwood
that's
the
substance
of
it.
yes,
sir.
mr.
judson
harwood
well,
i
don't
have
that
right
before
me.
my
recollection
is
that
it
does
that
the
affidavit
requirement
goes
more
--
goes
further
than
just
being
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
judson
harwood
it
--
mr.
judson
harwood
he
does
not
believe
in
or
he's
not
a
member
of
the
organization.
it
does
have
words
more
than
just
a
mere
fact
that
he
is
or
he's
not
a
card-carrying
member.
so
we
think
that
in
this
case,
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
is
right
and
certainty,
a
court
when
the
undisputed
facts
in
the
record
show
that
the
affidavit
is
false,
is
not
required
as
the
sixth
circuit
state
--
stated
to
close
its
eyes
to
the
reality
no
more
than
this
court.
we
think
any
court
can
look
at
the
realities
and
not
be
made
the
agency
of
an
abuse,
and
we
think
the
sixth
circuit
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
judson
harwood
no,
sir.
if
--
the
red
light
is
on.
if
i
may
have
a
moment
--
mr.
judson
harwood
the
--
the
coca-cola
case
discusses
the
general
principle.
it
doesn't
go
into
it
to
that
extent
and
we
have
another
compliance
issue
in
this
case
that's
discussed
in
my
brief,
although
i
don't
believe
it's
properly
in
this
court
because
we've
made
an
offer
of
proof
that
there
was
in
fact
a
vice-president
who
had
not
signed
it.
but
i
--
on
reflection,
i
believe
that
if
that
should
ever
come
--
be
material,
it
would
have
to
be
made
in
a
motion
to
remand
in
the
sixth
circuit.
thank
you,
your
honor.
