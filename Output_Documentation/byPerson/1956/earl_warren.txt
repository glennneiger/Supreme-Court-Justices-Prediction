mr.
blow.
mr.
blow,
reply.
chief
justice
warren
was
he
bedridden
while
he
was
in
the
hospital?
chief
justice
warren
didn't
the
court
in
trono
say
that
they
were
applying
the
rules
of
organized
states
district
courts?
chief
justice
warren
is
there
an
accepted
state
rule
in
this
field?
chief
justice
warren
can
it
fairly
be
said
from
the
record
that
the
police
waited
until
they
got
the
statements
they
wanted
before
they
did
take
him
to
a
magistrate?
chief
justice
warren
and
he
couldn't
have
gone
to
his
own
hospital,
could
he
during
that
time?
chief
justice
warren
no.
but
what
i
mean
is,
would
the
--
would
the
hospital
have
released
him
if
he
--
chief
justice
warren
--
had
wanted
to
go
to
his
own
hospital?
chief
justice
warren
yes.
chief
justice
warren
as
a
matter
of
practice,
do
they
ever
arraign
prisoners
while
they're
in
that
hospital?
do
you
know?
chief
justice
warren
do
the
--
or
does
the
government
contend
that
you
know
that
it
is
the
position
with
the
police
that
the
only
reason
they
didn't
take
him
before
a
magistrate
was
that
he
was
ill
during
that
period
or
has
that
question
arisen?
chief
justice
warren
you
may,
mr.
blow.
mr.
sand,
could
you
proceed
please?
chief
justice
warren
why
wasn't
he
arraigned
before?
chief
justice
warren
too
sick
to
be
arraigned
but
not
too
sick
to
be
questioned
by
police?
chief
justice
warren
you
mean
to
question
him
--
chief
justice
warren
--
about
the
murder?
chief
justice
warren
or
to
talked
to
him.
which
did
--
which
did
he
answer?
chief
justice
warren
(voice
overlap)
there's
a
lot
of
difference
if
you
will
admit,
won't
you?
a
lot
of
person
says,
"well,
may
i
speak
to
the
sick
man?"
that's
one
thing,
"but
may
i
question
him
about
his
possible
participation
in
the
murder
--
chief
justice
warren
--
about
some
happenings.
chief
justice
warren
was
he
under
arrest?
chief
justice
warren
at
the
time
he
went
to
the
hospital,
that
private
hospital,
was
he
under
arrest?
chief
justice
warren
who
took
them
there?
chief
justice
warren
how
long
was
he
in
the
private
hospital?
chief
justice
warren
that
same
day.
chief
justice
warren
assume
that
--
that
first
conversation
is
not
tainted.
how
about
the
others
after
he
was
locked
up?
chief
justice
warren
you
mean
on
his
own
testimony?
chief
justice
warren
did
the
government
try
to
--
the
government
tried
to
arraign
him
earlier
than
it
did?
chief
justice
warren
how
do
you
know
that's
the
earliest
time
he
could
have
been
arraigned
then?
chief
justice
warren
mr.
sand,
there's
one
more
question
in
the
case
that
seems
to
me
is
worthy
of
discussion.
are
you
going
to
reach
that?
chief
justice
warren
yes,
i
do.
chief
justice
warren
will
you
point
out
to
us
what
--
what
those
remarks
were,
please?
chief
justice
warren
62.
chief
justice
warren
it
isn't
very
long,
will
you
read
it?
the
--
chief
justice
warren
--
the
part
that
--
that
provoked
this
act
--
this
talk
on
the
part
of
the
district
attorney.
chief
justice
warren
page
62,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
oh,
the
government's
brief,
i
thought
it
was
the
record
of
his.
chief
justice
warren
now,
where
does
that
appear
in
the
record?
i
--
there
are
some
deletions
--
chief
justice
warren
--
there
and
i
thought
i
saw
it
in
the
record
where
it
wasn't
very
long.
chief
justice
warren
yes.
chief
justice
warren
all
right.
now,
what
--
what
did
the
prosecutor
have
said?
chief
justice
warren
well,
that
isn't
the
language
i'm
referring
to.
i'm
referring
to
this
language
that
the
district
attorney
said,
"now,
if
you
should
find
this
defendant
guilty,
the
responsibility
as
to
the
consequences
of
your
verdict
falls
to
someone
else.
it
is
not
you,
you
don't
have
to
come
down
here
at
some
time
later
or
even
today
or
tomorrow
whenever
you
bring
your
verdict
back
and
say
"well,
now
you
go
to
the
electric
--
electric
chair."
that
is
not,
your
honor
--
your
function.
that
is
his
honor's
function
and
it
doesn't
end
there.
there
is
the
united
states
court
of
appeals.
they
have
a
responsibility
to
sift
the
facts
and
look
them
over
and
decide
whether
this
man
will
go
to
the
electric
chair.
there
is
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
if
they
see
fit,
they
can
look
these
facts
over
and
decide
if
this
man
goes
to
the
electric
--
to
the
electric
chair.
there
is
the
president
of
the
united
states
who
may
look
these
facts
over.
and
as
you
will
know,
often
these
sentences
are
commuted
to
something
less
than
death
in
the
electric
chair.
there
is
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
who
may
make
recommendations
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
relative
to
the
senates.
now,
i
mention
that
ladies
and
gentlemen
because
i
want
to
emphasize
to
you
that
it
is
the
responsibility
of
those
people,
the
judge,
the
court
of
appeals,
the
supreme
court,
if
they
should
decide
to
hear
the
case.
the
president
of
the
united
states,
if
it
should
come
to
his
attention.
it
is
the
responsibility
of
those
people
to
decide
whether
this
man
goes
to
the
electric
chair.
it
is
not
yours,
ladies
and
gentlemen.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
because
i
consider
it
important
that
your
function
be
defined
by
me
to
you."
now,
is
that
--
is
that
a
correct
statement
for
--
for
a
district
attorney
to
make?
chief
justice
warren
well
then,
will
you
--
will
you
show
me
in
this
record
what
language
we
can
rely
on
in
saying
that
the
defense
counsel
provoked
that
and
thus,
made
it
the
judgment?
chief
justice
warren
what
is
--
chief
justice
warren
what
were
the
words
he
used
and
where
are
they
to
be
found?
chief
justice
warren
page
62.
now,
will
you
quote
the
language
that
you
say
justifies
that
argument
on
the
part
of
the
district
attorney?
chief
justice
warren
well,
not
just
for
example.
let's
take
what
--
what
is
important
in
it
that
--
that
provoked
this.
chief
justice
warren
61.
chief
justice
warren
is
there
any
--
chief
justice
warren
--
trouble
about
there?
chief
justice
warren
well,
is
there
anything
wrong
with
that
statement?
isn't
that
perfectly
legitimate
argument?
chief
justice
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
warren
no
--
no.
not
--
lets
--
let's
take
your
own
brief.
chief
justice
warren
he
followed
that
up
with
saying,
"no
one
on
the
face
of
the
earth
--
chief
justice
warren
--
can
challenge
your
individual
decision
on
what
you
consider
the
facts
to
be."
is
there
anything
wrong
with
that?
chief
justice
warren
well,
then
--
chief
justice
warren
meaning
the
--
the
question
of
his
--
his
--
chief
justice
warren
--
guilt
or
innocent,
yes.
chief
justice
warren
that
is
true,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
is
there
anything
wrong
with
that
--
chief
justice
warren
--
that
argument
when
a
man
is
defending
another
one
for
his
life?
chief
justice
warren
all
right.
i
just
want
to
--
i
just
want
to
see
where
we
get
to
the
bad
language.
chief
justice
warren
yes.
chief
justice
warren
yes.
chief
justice
warren
yes.
chief
justice
warren
is
there
anything
wrong
with
that
as
a
matter
of
argument?
chief
justice
warren
yes.
but
now
there
are
deletions
all
the
way
through
there
which
--
which
indicate
that
--
that
that
is
not
in
context,
that
--
that
there
something
else
that
that
argument
refers
to.
chief
justice
warren
well,
the
--
chief
justice
warren
well,
if
there's
any
--
chief
justice
warren
--
if
there's
any
damaging
material
in
there
to
the
--
to
the
defendant,
i
would
like
to
hear
it
--
chief
justice
warren
--
because
i
--
i
think
that
unless
his
conduct
in
the
part
of
the
district
attorney
is
--
is
justified
by
some
--
some
very
extraneous
argument
by
the
defendant,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
it
was
--
was
most
improper.
most
improper
to
indicate
that
--
that
the
responsibility
is
on
the
president
of
the
united
states
to
determine
whether
the
man
is
going
to
be
executed
or
not.
the
--
the
argument
on
his
part
that
the
attorney
general
can
largely
determine
whether
he
is
going
to
be
executed
or
not
after
a
jury
has
--
has
convicted
it.
the
argument
that
the
court
of
appeals
and
this
court
are
to
judge
the
facts
in
order
--
before
this
man
can
go
to
the
--
go
to
his
death
is
not
fair
argument.
it
isn't
the
fact
because
the
jury
is
the
only
--
the
only
agent
to
say
--
that
can
judge
the
facts.
chief
justice
warren
yes.
chief
justice
warren
did
you
point
that
out
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
warren
because
you
haven't
read
any
language
to
us
yet
that
--
that
would
show
that.
chief
justice
warren
you
may
--
chief
justice
warren
you
may
see
of
course.
chief
justice
warren
yes,
you
may.
chief
justice
warren
mr.
blow,
i
--
before
you
sit
down.
i
--
i
see
from
the
record
that
you
and
mr.
rublee
and
mr.
ford,
your
associates,
are
--
are
serving
through
appointment
of
the
courts
below,
that
you
have
served
in
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
this
court,
this
impecunious
defendant.
i
want
to
say
to
you
the
--
and
the
court
considers
that
in
doing
so,
you
--
you
are
rendering
a
public
service
which
we
appreciate
very
much.
and
now,
i
say
to
you
mr.
sand,
of
course,
that
that
will
not
detract
him
slightly
in
the
very
important
service
that
you
render
in
--
in
serving
your
government
as
you
do
to
this
important
case.
chief
justice
warren
number
46,
everett
d.
green
versus
united
states
of
america.
mr.
blow.
chief
justice
warren
you
may.
mr.
sand.
chief
justice
warren
mr.
sand
may
i
ask
this
question.
in
this
case
there
were
three
verdicts
submitted
by
the
judge.
one
for
guilty
or
not
guilty
of
arson,
one
guilty
or
not
guilty
of
first
degree
murder
and
one
guilty
or
not
guilty
of
second
degree
murder.
suppose
in
this
case
that
the
jury
had
specifically
found
the
defendant
not
guilty
of
first
degree
murder
but
he
did
as
it
did
here
finding
guilty
of
both
second
degree
murder
and
arson.
he
took
the
appeal.
the
case
was
reversed
for
the
same
reason
it
was
reversed
here.
would
your
situation
be
changed
legally?
chief
justice
warren
no
i
am
asking
your
position,
would
you
be
arguing
here
as
you
are
arguing
now
to
retry
this
man?
chief
justice
warren
what
is
the
difference?
tell
us
the
precise
difference
between
the
two,
will
you
please,
where
a
man
is
charged
with
murder
and
he
is
given
two
murders,
one
for
first
degree
murder,
one
of
second
degree
murder.
what
is
the
difference
if
those
are
submitted
to
him
and
the
court
receives
the
verdict,
one
of
them
is
blank
and
the
other
is
a
conviction?
what
is
the
difference
between
that
case
(inaudible)
chief
justice
warren
is
this
an
included
offense?
chief
justice
warren
it
is
another
kind
of
a
crime
but
not
here.
you
don't
contend
do
you
that
the
second
degree
murder
is
an
included
offence
under
this
indictment?
chief
justice
warren
you
answered
me
one
way,
you
said
to
me
that
you
would
be
in
the
same
legal
position
if
those
two
situations
that
i
pointed
out
to
you
where
here,
whichever
one
was
here,
you
answered
the
opposite
to
justice
frankfurter.
now
just
which
is
that
i
would
like
to
know,
i
would
like
to
know,
if
there
is
any
--
would
be
any
difference
in
your
position
here,
if
instead
of
returning
a
blank
verdict,
on
the
first
degree
issue,
the
jury
specifically
said
we
the
jury
find
the
defendant
not
guilty
of
first
degree
murder.
chief
justice
warren
may
i
ask
my
question
and
then
--
chief
justice
warren
no,
but
i
would
like
to
have
my
question,
then
please
you
can
answer
your
question
any
way
you
want,
but
you've
got
him
confused
with
now
i
think,
i
would
like
to
have
him
answer
my
question.
chief
justice
warren
i'm
sure
you
don't.
you
are
confused
by
the
questions.
chief
justice
warren
i
think
so.
chief
justice
warren
but
we
weren't
helping
him,
we
were
confusing
him.
chief
justice
warren
now
i
would
just
like
to
ask
you
one
more
question
and
then
i'm
going
to
leave
it.
is
second
degree
murder
an
included
offense
under
this
indictment?
chief
justice
warren
but
let's
take
the
indictment
and
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
don't
care
about
the
goodall
case
right
now.
under
the
indictment
and
the
facts
of
this
case,
is
second
degree
murder
an
included
offense?
chief
justice
warren
right
and
now
excuse
me
for
taking
for
much
--
chief
justice
warren
we'll
recess
now
mr.
–
chief
justice
warren
you
may
proceed
mr.
sand.
chief
justice
warren
well,
mr.
sand,
when
does
--
when
does
jeopardy
attached
in
a
--
in
a
felony
case?
isn't
it
when
the
jury
sworn
and
they
proceed
to
try
the
case
and
unless
--
unless
the
case
is
interrupted
in
the
middle
of
it
because
of
some
unusual
circumstance
that
--
that
would
bring
about
injustice,
the
man
has
been
placed
in
jeopardy?
now,
if
that
is
true,
if
that
is
the
law,
what
has
happened?
what
did
happen
in
this
case
to
get
around
that
question
of
jeopardy
when
the
jury
sworn
and
the
evidence
was
taken?
chief
justice
warren
what
verdict
--
what
verdict
are
you
talking
about?
chief
justice
warren
but
was
there
--
there
was
no
verdict
reversed
as
to
first
degree
murder
on
which
he
was
put
in
jeopardy.
chief
justice
warren
mr.
sand,
may
i
ask
one
more
question
please.
suppose
in
this
case,
the
court
instructed
them
on
both
first
and
second
degree
murder
and
arson,
the
jury
brought
back
two
blank
verdicts
on
the
murder,
convicted
him
of
arson
and
the
appeal
is
arson
conviction,
and
it
was
reversed.
would
--
would
you
then
be
in
the
same
position
he
has
here
legally?
chief
justice
warren
no,
no,
no.
it's
just
--
they
--
they
weren't
discharged
because
the
jury
didn't
agree.
he
didn't
ask
them
any
such
thing.
he
just
--
he
just
accepted
the
verdict
and
as
he
did
in
this
case.
he
accepted
that
blank
verdict
on
first
degree
murder,
a
verdict
of
guilty
on
the
second
degree
murder
and
a
--
and
a
verdict
of
guilty
on
arson.
now,
suppose
instead
of
there
being
a
verdict
of
guilty
on
that
second
degree
murder
charge,
suppose
they
just
found
him
guilty
of
the
arson
and
let
the
other
two
blank,
would
--
would
you
be
the
--
in
a
different
position
than
you
are
now,
if
they
tried
him
and
give
him
a
death
penalty?
chief
justice
warren
well
--
chief
justice
warren
well,
it's
been
my
experience
that
if
you
have
three
verdicts
and
one
of
