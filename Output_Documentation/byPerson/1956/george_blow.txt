mr.
blow
yes,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court.
nearly
four
years
ago
on
the
26th
of
may
1953,
a
fire
was
reported
at
a
brownstone
house
on
massachusetts
avenue
in
the
district
of
columbia.
two
people
lived
in
this
house.
one
was
the
petitioner;
the
other
was
an
elderly
lady
and
in
blood
who
shared
the
house
with
him
for
a
number
of
years
prior
to
the
fire.
she
was
found
in
her
bedroom
by
a
fireman,
taken
outside
and
soon
thereafter
pronounced
dead.
petitioner
was
found
in
the
basement
bathtub
of
this
house,
lying
facedown
in
a
pool
of
water
suffering
from
several
--
what
turned
out
to
be
ice
pick
wounds
in
his
chest
and
two
in
his
neck.
and
apparent
--
mr.
blow
yes,
your
honor.
and
apparently
unconscious.
he
was
carried
out
to
the
lawn,
administered
oxygen
and
an
ambulance
were
secured
to
take
him
to
emergency
hospital.
on
investigation
of
this
fire,
it
appeared
that
it
had
been
deliberately
set.
and
since
the
house
was
found
to
be
locked,
and
since
all
but
one
window
in
the
house
was
found
to
be
closed,
suspicion
immediately
pointed
the
petitioners
as
the
author
of
the
fire.
now,
the
petitioner
was
kept
at
emergency
hospital
until
approximately
2:10
p.m.
on
the
afternoon
of
may
26th
at
which
time
he
was
taken
by
the
police
to
the
strong
room
at
the
district
of
columbia
general
hospital.
he
was
kept
there
until
the
morning
--
late
in
the
morning
of
may
28
at
which
time
he
was
taken
by
the
police
to
the
deputy
coroner
and
who
acted
as
committing
magistrate,
and
for
the
first
time
advised
that
he
had
a
right
to
counsel,
that
he
had
a
right
not
to
make
a
statement,
that
any
statement
might
be
used
against
him.
mr.
blow
yes,
your
honor,
he
was.
he
was
bedridden
though
the
police
and
fire
department
inspectors
testified
that
when
they
interrogated
him,
he
was
able
to
stand
up
and
some
said
that
he
was
able
to
sit
up
on
the
bed,
that
was
in
controversy,
your
honor.
nevertheless,
he
was
in
--
in
a
bed
in
this
locked
ward.
the
deputy
coroner
committed
him
to
the
custody
of
the
attorney
general
to
await
grand
jury
action.
the
grand
jury,
very
shortly
thereafter,
came
up
with
a
two-count
indictment.
now,
the
first
count
of
that
indictment
which
is
found
at
pages
2
and
3
of
this
record
read,
"on
or
about
may
26,
1953
within
the
district
of
columbia,
everett
d.
green
maliciously
did
burn
and
caused
to
be
burned
the
certain
building
known
as
1115
massachusetts
avenue,
the
property
of
gerald
gray
(ph)."
the
second
count
in
that
same
indictment
incorporated
the
language
of
the
first
and
provided
on
or
about
may
26,
1953
within
the
district
of
columbia,
everett
d.green
committed
the
offense
of
arson.
that
is
to
say,
he
maliciously
did
burn
and
caused
to
be
burned
a
certain
building
known
as
1115
massachusetts
avenue,
north
west,
the
property
of
gerald
gray
(ph).
and
in
perpetrating
the
offense
of
arson,
a
fore
set,
caused
bettie
brown
to
inhale
certain
gases,
the
inhalation
of
which
resulted
in
her
death
within
the
district
of
columbia
on
or
about
may
26,
1953.
thus,
while
the
first
count
charged
the
petitioner
with
the
offense
of
arson
under
section
401
of
the
district
of
columbia
code.
the
second
count,
in
addition
to
charging
him
with
arson,
charged
him
with
responsibility
for
the
consequent
death
which
under
the
district
of
columbia
code
is
murder
in
the
first
degree.
and
that
section
of
the
code
reads
in
this
way.
"whoever,
being
of
sound
memory
and
discretion,
without
purpose
so
to
do
kills
another
and
perpetrating
an
arson
as
defined
in
section
401
is
guilty
of
murder
in
the
first
degree."
to
this
indictment,
the
defendant
pled
not
guilty.
at
the
conclusion
of
his
first
trial,
the
jury
was
fully
and
properly
instructed
that
if
they
believe
that
the
defendant
was
perpetrating
an
arson
and
that
in
the
perpetration
of
this
arson,
deceased
inhaled
certain
gasses
which
caused
her
death,
they
were
to
return
a
verdict
of
first
degree
murder
against
him.
and
of
course
they
were
instructed
that
they
could
acquit
him.
but
--
and
here
we
find
the
trial
judge
on
his
own
motion
instructing
the
jury
that
they
could
also
find
the
defendant
guilty
of
murder
in
the
second
degree.
the
jury
retired
to
consider
its
verdict
and
came
back
and
reported
to
the
court.
we
find
the
defendant
guilty
of
arson
on
count
one.
we
find
the
defendant
guilty
of
second
degree
murder
on
the
second
count.
and
on
march
19,
1954,
the
court
adjudged
the
petitioner
guilty
of
arson
and
of
second
degree
murder.
now,
this
conviction
of
arson
was
never
appealed.
the
defendant
has
served
his
sentence
on
that
charge.
the
sentence
was
complete
on
march
19,
1957.
but
he
did
appeal
his
conviction
of
second
degree
murder
and
he
contended
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record,
at
his
first
trial,
to
sustain
a
conviction
of
second
degree
murder.
and
this
contention
was
accepted
by
the
majority
of
the
three-judge
bench
which
heard
argument
on
his
first
appeal.
and
that
court
therefore,
reversed
the
case
and
remanded
to
the
district
court.
once
in
the
district
court,
when
it
appeared
that
the
defendant
was
to
be
prosecuted
again
by
the
government
on
the
same
indictment
on
a
charge
of
first
degree
felony
murder,
he
interposed
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
on
the
ground
of
former
jeopardy.
this
motion
was
denied
by
the
trial
judge.
the
trial
proceeded
and
resulted
in
the
conviction,
as
originally
charged,
of
murder
in
the
first
degree.
the
mandatory
sentence
of
death
was
imposed
and
petitioner
brought
this
appeal.
now,
we
have
briefed
four
arguments
for
the
petitioner
and
the
first
two
involved
former
jeopardy.
should
this
court
sustain
either,
we
submit
that
it
would
be
proper
to
order
the
defendant
released
and
further
proceedings
against
him
barred.
the
second
two,
involved
the
question
of
a
new
trial.
we
feel
that
if
our
contention
on
double
jeopardy
is
overruled,
the
trial
which
this
man
have,
his
second
trial
was
characterized
by
two
errors
which
must
result
in
it
being
vacated
and
sent
back
for
a
new
trial.
of
these
four,
outlining
the
brief,
the
first
concerns
the
extent
of
waiver
that
will
be
presumed
in
an
appeal.
the
second
relies
on
the
rule
that
unappealed
conviction
of
a
lesser
included
offense
in
the
offense
charged
in
the
indictment
must
--
are
subsequent
proceedings
on
the
higher
charge.
the
third
concerns
the
admission
of
statements
which
this
man
made
to
the
police
officers
during
a
period
of
nearly
two
and
a
half
days
prior
to
this
arraignment
and
prior
to
his
being
advised
concerns.
and
we
feel
those
should
be
and
excluded
under
the
rule
promulgated
by
this
court
in
mcnabb
versus
the
united
states.
mr.
blow
they
were
not
confessions,
your
honor.
they
were
incriminating
statements.
they
were
--
there
were
some
statements
designed
to
be
exculpatory.
nevertheless,
they
were
given
under
circumstances
that
were
inherently
untrustworthy.
they
were
vitally
important
to
the
government's
case.and
since
the
decision
of
this
court
in
upper
versus
the
united
states,
we
feel
that
there
is
no
real
basis
for
distinguishing
between
an
exculpatory
statement
which
hangs
the
petitioner
or
a
confession
which
does
the
same
thing.
mr.
blow
he
was
taken
by
the
police
with
a
police
guard.
mr.
blow
yes,
your
honor.
he
was
first
interrogated
at
10
o'clock
in
the
morning
by
detective
sergeant
couture.
that
--
that
--
know
it
at
8:45,
that
was
within
an
hour
of
his
being
taken
out
of
their
house.
and
at
that
time
detective
sergeant
couture
called
the
third
precinct
and
asked
them
to
send
a
guard
down.
of
--
the
third
precinct
didn't
so
when
couture
went
back
at
10
o'clock,
he
had
to
call
up
again
to
get
a
guard
for
this
man.
mr.
blow
the
first
questioning
took
place
at
8:30
or
08:45.
the
first
statement
was
taken
at
10
o'clock.
mr.
blow
the
first
questioning
was
while
the
man
was
on
the
emergency
table
--
mr.
blow
--
at
emergency
hospital.
and
his
wounds
hadn't
been
treated
at
that
time.
mr.
blow
the
statements
which
we
complain
of
were
testified
too
by
police
and
fire
department
inspectors.
on
--
they
are
of
different
types.
the
first
we
complain
of
were
made
on
may
28
at
9
o'clock
in
the
morning
before
the
man
was
taken
before
the
committing
magistrate.
he
was
to
be
taken
at
11
o'clock
and
discharged
at
that
time
of
--
so
that
he
could
be
taken.
at
that
time,
he
made
the
remark
in
response
to
questioning
by
detective
that
he
had
told
people
that
if
they
ever
threw
him
out
of
their
house,
he
was
going
to
blow
it
up
and
blow
his
brains
out.
at
his
trial,
both
these
detective
sergeant
couture
and
detective
sergeant
clark
testified
this
remark,
it
showed
malice.
it
may
have
showed
any
--
the
prejudicial
effect
of
such
a
remark
can't
--
can't
be
under
us.
mr.
blow
over
two
days.
mr.
blow
he
made
statements
from
the
very
beginning
which
were
used
as
an
affirmative
part
of
the
government,
this
case.
we've
put
this
down
in
chronological
order
at
page
26
of
our
brief,
to
this
court.
at
the
bottom
of
page
27,
sergeant
clark
testified
that
he
had
asked
green
whether
he
came
down
the
stairs,
the
front
stairs
or
the
back
stairs.
that
detective
sergeant
testified.
on
further
questioning,
he
changed
his
story
and
told
me
that
he
went
down
the
back
staircase.
couture
testified
that
green
stated
he
did
not
stop
on
the
first
floor
and
this
was
vitally
important
because
the
defendant
later
testified,
as
it
knew
--
government
knew
he
would
that
he
stopped
on
the
first
floor
to
telephone
a
friend
to
ignore
a
suicide
note
which
is
written
and
mailed
about
midnight
that
night.
he
nowhere
mentioned
that
he
have
found
miss
brown
dead
before
he
went
to
bed
that
evening.
now,
that
was
vitally
important.
in
that,
the
government
used
it
to
show
that
he
could
not
be
possibly
be
telling
the
truth
at
any
time
while
he
was
on
the
stand.
and
the
government
set
this
up
deliberately
or
by
asking
the
policemen
and
the
department
of
--
with
the
fire
department
inspectors.
"did
you
ask
him,
what
was
his
answer?"
the
same
thing
with
regard
to
the
letter,
"did
you
ask
him
whether
he
had
written
a
letter?"
"i
just
so
happen
i
did
ask
him
and
he
said
no.
and
he
said
no
until
i
found
the
letter
and
presented
it
to
him
on
march
--
on
--
on
28th
of
may."
there
wasn't
a
shred
of
defense
left
by
the
time
this
testimony
was
introduced
because
they
had
taken
these
remarks
which
the
defendant
made
while
in
the
hospital
and
introduced
to
show
that
nothing
but
the
circumstantial
evidence
of
what
happened
in
that
house
could
be
believed.
mr.
blow
yes,
your
honor.
we
looked
at
the
indictment
and
we
say
that
though
conviction
of
any
crime
could
be
based
on
that
indictment
unless
arson
were
proved.
if
your
honors
will
permit,
turning
to
the
first
point
which
concerns
the
waiver
of
jeopardy
in
this
case,
there
is
no
doubt
whatsoever
but
that
the
defendant
was
in
jeopardy
at
his
first
trial
on
a
charge
of
felony
murder
as
set
forth
in
the
statute
and
his
indictment.
and
for
reasons
known
only
to
themselves,
the
members
of
the
jury
did
not
return
a
verdict
of
the
crime
with
which
the
defendant
was
charged.
still,
this
second
degree
of
conviction
--
mr.
blow
pardon?
mr.
blow
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
blow
at
the
second
trial.
yes,
yes,
of
course,
murder
was
before
the
jury
on
the
second
trial
because
our
motion
to
dismiss
was
denied.
but
at
the
first
trial,
murder
was
also
before
the
jury.
since
the
judge
properly
instructed
them
that
if
they
believed
this
woman
died
in
the
fire,
they
should
return
the
verdict
to
first
degree
murder
and
they
didn't.
mr.
blow
not
on
that
instruction,
your
honor.
they
returned
the
verdict
of
second
degree
murder
because
the
trial
judge
had
instructed
them
they
could.
mr.
blow
well,
your
honor,
they
didn't
find
him
--
mr.
blow
--
not
guilty
--
mr.
blow
--
but
we
don't
know
why.
we
don't
know
why
but
we
can
speculate
on
that.
mr.
blow
that
is
exactly
what
we
mean,
sir.
mr.
blow
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
blow
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
that
relates
to
--
to
the
very
old
idea
of
the
common
law.
well,
initially,
a
common
law,
no
man
--
a
man
could
be
denied
a
trial
--
a
new
trial
or
an
appeal
altogether
since
under
the
strict
language
of
double
jeopardy
provisions,
he
couldn't
be
put
in
jeopardy
a
second
time.
and
as
one
circuit
court
observed,
i
think
in
1836
of
this
view
of
the
constitution
or
of
the
common
law
rule
of
double
jeopardy,
guaranteed
to
a
defendant
the
right
of
being
hanged
instead
of
to
--
to
save
him
from
the
danger
of
a
new
trial.
now,
that
result
was
so
obviously
irrational.
that
the
common
law
courts
in
construing
provisions
against
second
jeopardy,
implied
a
waiver
so
as
to
permit
the
defendant
to
waive
jeopardy
as
to
the
degree
of
offense
of
which
he
was
previously
convicted.
now,
this
waiver
was
obviously
in
accord
with
the
desire
of
--
of
a
defendant.
he
--
if
he
were
tried
for
--
for
--
of
robbery
and
--
and
convict
and
sentenced
to
20
years,
he
couldn't
loose
anything
by
being
retried
for
robbery
of
the
first
waiver.
and
our
appendix
a
sets
forth
a
list
of
the
48
states
of
the
united
states
of
america.
and
that
appendix
shows
that
23
courts
adhered
or
found
in
the
common
law,
that
rule
of
limited
waiver.
and
they
said
this
is
done
because
it's
in
the
best
interest
of
the
accused.
mr.
blow
your
honor,
the
--
mr.
blow
--
well
certainly
--
certainly,
in
the
--
mr.
blow
--
an
acquittal.
mr.
blow
we
--
we
haven't
apply
--
an
implied
acquittal
in
the
sense
that
the
jury
was
silent
as
to
the
offense
with
which
he
was
charged
in
the
offense
of
first
degree
murder
on
which
they
were
distracted.
mr.
blow
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
blow
--
of
--
of
jeopardy.
the
constitution
says,
"no
--
no
man
shall
be
for
the
same
offense,
twice
put
in
jeopardy
of
life."
now,
he
was
in
jeopardy
on
the
first
degree
charge
and
he
wasn't
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
blow
well,
the
--
mr.
blow
he
was
in
fact
acquitted
by
the
silence
of
the
jury
on
the
count
with
which
he
was
charged.
but
that
isn't
--
we
--
we
feel
that's
not
the
important
thing
whether
--
whether
an
acquittal
is
expressed
or
implied,
the
--
the
important
thing
seems
to
be
to
us
that
here
was
a
clear
case
of
once
in
jeopardy.
mr.
blow
that's
correct,
your
honor,
because
--
mr.
blow
we're
taking
the
position
that
there
was
a
very
definite
acquittal
in
the
jury
silence
on
the
first
degree
charge.
and
--
and
jeopardy
comes
in,
to
protect
him
against
the
second
trial
on
the
same
charge.
now
--
now,
when
--
when
we're
talking
about
common
law
of
courts,
we're
--
we're
not
talking
about
courts
or
be
at
federal
courts,
courts
in
territories
of
the
united
states
where
there
is
no
tradition
of
the
common
law.
and
this
court
had
occasion
on
--
in
1904
and
1905
to
examine
the
criminal
procedures
based
on
the
spanish
which
were
in
effect
in
the
philippine
islands.
now,
those
procedures
more
resembled
the
procedures
in
some
of
our
state
police
courts
than
they
did
those
in
effect
in
the
federal
courts
of
the
united
states
today.
in
that,
a
man
convicted
from
this
misdemeanor
in
many
of
our
states
and
then
charged
with
a
traffic
violation,
may
be
tried
by
a
court,
not
of
record
without
a
jury
sentenced
to
ten
days
and
either
serve
his
sentence,
in
which
case
it
is
a
bar
for
further
proceedings
or
at
his
own
motion,
reopened
the
proceedings
in
a
court
of
record
before
a
jury
and
in
that
case
suffer
the
risk
of
being
found
guilty
by
a
jury
of
a
higher
offense
than
that
which
he
was
previously
convicted
by
the
police
court
judge
and
serving
a
corresponding
in
ordinance
to
be
a
sentence.
now
in
the
philippines,
this
procedure
apply
in
even
the
most
serious
cases.
and
in
trono
--
in
trono
versus
the
united
states,
trono
and
his
two
codefendants
were
tried
on
an
information
by
a
trial
magistrate
without
a
jury.
when
they
exercised
their
right
of
appeal,
the
audencia,
the
supreme
court
of
the
philippine
islands
didn't
send
it
back
for
a
new
trial,
they
substituted
their
own
findings
of
fact
on
the
charge
and
imposed
the
more
--
imposed
a
verdict
of
a
more
--
guilty
of
a
more
serious
offense,
imposed
a
more
serious
sentence.
now,
that
is
something
very
different
and
i
think
that
it's
very
different,
is
illustrated
by
the
view
which
mr.
justice
brown,
one
of
the
four
justices
in
trono
who
held
that
this
procedure
was
proper
--
mr.
blow
--
in
and
of
itself.
mr.
justice
brown
expressed
his
thought
in
a
case
a
year
before
that
it
was
in
conceivable
to
him
that
congress,
when
it
enacted
legislation
for
the
philippine
islands,
intended
to
give
a
trial
magistrate
in
the
philippines,
the
power
to
finally
acquit
the
most
serious
offenses.
it
would
be
as
though
the
trial
magistrate
in
the
police
courts
endeavored
to
finally
acquit
a
man
who
is
guilty
of
murder.
he
just
couldn't
do
it.
it
wouldn't
be
entrusted
to
him.
it
was
inconceivable
to
mr.
justice
brown
of
this
court
that
it
should
be
entrusted
to
a
philippine
trial
magistrate.
therefore,
he
concurred
in
the
four-judge
opinion,
written
by
mr.
justice
peckham
with
this
court
which
held
that
that
philippine
procedure
was
permissible.
now,
in
that
case,
four
justices
of
this
court
dissented,
justice
holmes
concurred
in
the
result
reached
by
mr.
justice
peckham.
that
four
justices
dissented.
and
we
submit
that
the
vigor
of
their
dissent
followed
from
certain
remarks
which
were
made
in
the
peckham
opinion
which
indicated
that
this
result
could
follow,
not
only
from
the
statute
in
the
philippines
but
was
not
antagonistic
to
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
and
exactly
what
they
feared
was
going
to
happen
has
happened,
and
the
man
here
has
--
has
been
held,
has
been
presumed
to
waive
a
constitutional
right
by
exercising
another
right
which
the
congress
gave
him
to
appeal
what
he
thought
was
an
injustice.
and
the
dissenting
justices
in
trono
set
very
emphatically,
they
did
not
believe
that
fundamental
constitutional
rights
and
statutory
rights
should
be
put
in
such
barter.
mr.
blow
no,
your
honor.
mr.
blow
we've
--
we
believe
the
trono
is
perfectly
good
law
for
those
territories
where
there
is
no
history
of
the
common
law.
and
we
do
not
seek
--
think
that
trono
under
--
under
philippine
circumstances
is
certainly
the
most
reasonable
result
to
be
raised.
mr.
blow
they
said,
your
honor,
in
--
in
--
before
judge
opinion,
written
by
mr.
justice
peckham,
made
the
statement,
"we
may
consider
this
problem
as
though
it
had
arisen
in
the
united
states."
and
the
reason
they
said
that
was
because
the
act
of
congress
which
governed
proceedings
in
the
philippines
are
used
language
similar
to
our
fifth
amendment
prohibition
against
second
jeopardy.
but
we
believe
that
there,
we
have
dictum
by
four
judges
--
we
don't
believe
that
dictum
is
correct.
mr.
blow
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
blow
yes,
your
honor,
quite
correct.
mr.
blow
quite
correct.
mr.
blow
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
he
would
--
he
would
permit
the
state
to
appeal.
to
him,
there
was
only
one
jeopardy
in
one
proceeding
which
went
on
for
as
along
as
the
proceeding
went
on.
mr.
blow
but,
your
honor,
so
far
as
waiver
is
concerned,
he
said
--
specifically
mentioned
waiver
and
he
said
that
to
him
it
was
inconceivable
that
a
man
should
be
held
to
waive.
mr.
blow
totally
different
approach
--
mr.
blow
yes,
your
honor.
and
--
and
he
--
he
felt
that
there
was
no
objection
to
--
to
a
government
appeal,
no
objection
to
a
defendant's
appeal
that
the
objective
was
to
find
a
trial
free
from
error
to
both
sides.
but
that
fair
view,
your
honor,
has
--
to
our
knowledge
only
being
accepted
in
--
in
connecticut
where
--
mr.
blow
except
to
the
extent,
your
honor,
that
justice
peckham
relied
on
waiver.
mr.
blow
and
--
and
mr.
justice
holmes
did
not.
mr.
blow
the
overwhelming
--
the
dissenting
judges
in
trono
pointed
out
that
the
overwhelming
weight
of
american
decided
cases
was
opposed
to
absolute
waiver.
in
other
words,
was
opposed
to
the
idea
of
extending
a
waiver
beyond
the
prisoner's
needs.
and
that's
true
today,
your
honor,
though
there
have
been
numerous
statutes
and
constitutional
amendments
which
this
court,
in
kring
versus
the
united
states,
way
back
in
1882,
said
that
the
states
could
do
if
they
wanted
to.
but
when
they
had
kring
which
was
exactly
our
situation
in
--
in
the
sense
that
he
had
been
convicted
of
a
lesser
degree
of
crime
and
the
government
attempted
on
retrial
to
bring
him
to
trial
on
a
higher,
this
court
held
that
the
state
of
missouri
could
not
do
that
because
they
have
changed
their
constitution
too
late
that
the
constitutional
change
which
would
permit
that
course
in
the
state
of
missouri
came
after
his
first
trial.
mr.
blow
yes
your
honor.
mr.
blow
yes,
your
honor.
passing
from
the
trono
point,
we
submit
that
there
is
a
second
alternative
bar
to
the
defendant's
prosecution.
mr.
blow
the
english
law,
your
honor?
so
far
as
i
understand
it,
appeals
are
allowed
in
england
as
a
matter
of
grace.
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
statutory
right
of
appeal
in
england.
however,
i
could
be
mistaken.
mr.
blow
but
we're
not
asking
that
--
that
rule
to
be
adopted
in
--
in
the
united
states,
your
honor.
our
--
mr.
blow
i
--
i
shouldn't
think
so,
your
honor.
we
cite
--
mr.
blow
we
--
we
cite
blackstone
in
our
brief.
we
--
we
cited
cooley
on
blackstone.
cooley
seems
to
indicate
that
result
wouldn't
be
possible.
cooley's
comment
of
blackstone
seems
to
indicate.
mr.
blow
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
blow
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
if
you
look
at
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
the
language
of
it,
that's
--
that's
a
logical
result
because
it
says,
"no
man
shall
be"
--
mr.
blow
well,
your
--
your
honor,
of
--
of
course
there
is
no
such
provision
in
--
in
the
district
for
a
recommendation
of
clemency.
but
--
but
with
regard
--
mr.
blow
--
to
the
question
whether
--
whether
--
no,
sir.
the
sentence
is
mandatory.
mr.
blow
no,
sir.
nor
does
the
court.
you're
--
if
you
were
found
guilty
of
first
degree
murder,
that
sentence
is
mandatory.
but
supposing
that
it
were
possible,
there
we
have
a
question
which
this
court
decided
in
stroud
versus
the
united
states
which
is
where
you
have
punishments,
then
there
is
no
second
jeopardy.
jeopardy
relates
to
the
offense
and
not
the
punishment.
mr.
blow
yes.
mr.
blow
yes,
sir.
mr.
blow
i'm
--
mr.
blow
your
honor,
that's
--
that's
the
argument
that
the
government
made
to
the
court
of
appeals
after
his
first
trial
--
mr.
blow
and
--
and
--
mr.
blow
yes,
sir.
mr.
blow
right.
mr.
blow
the
--
the
second
degree
verdict
--
mr.
blow
--
demeanor,
the
arson
verdict
stood.
mr.
blow
and
properly
instructed
by
the
court
--
mr.
blow
--
as
this
first
jury
was.
mr.
blow
that
is
correct,
i
think,
your
honor.
mr.
blow
no,
your
honor.
because
in
that
case,
the
man
was
convicted
of
the
offense
with
which
he
was
charged.
and
an
appeal
of
that
offense
could
be
awarded
a
new
degree,
a
new
trial
on
that
degree
of
the
offense.
if
he
was
convicted
at
fist,
he
could
be
tried
again
for
first.
the
sentence
has
nothing
to
do
with
double
jeopardy.
mr.
blow
than
--
than
the
--
than
the
clemency
case.
this
--
mr.
blow
--
i
--
we
don't
--
we
don't
say
that
trono
has
anything
to
do
with
--
with
the
clemency
case.
it
has
to
do
--
in
trono
--
in
trono,
there
were
three
degrees
of
the
offense.
one
was
assault,
one
was
homicide,
one
was
murder
and
the
--
of
first
trial
magistrate
find
him
guilty
of
assault,
the
audencia
has
own
motion
raised
the
homicide.
now,
in
our
second
--
in
our
second
point,
we
say
that
there
was
a
lesser
included
offense
which
wasn't
second
degree
murder
but
was
arson.
and
in
support
of
that,
we
looked
to
the
indictment
because
under
the
rules
of
federal
criminal
procedure
is
the
indictment
which
governs.
a
man
can
be
convicted
of
an
offense
necessarily
included
in
that
charge.
and
in
this
indictment
on
or
about
may
26,
1953,
maliciously
affirmed
property
--
property
of
another,
arson,
have
set
up
the
arson
and
they
add
the
clause
that
in
perpetrating
that
arson
caused
the
death
of
bettie
brown.
it
is
a
sufficient
indictment
under
the
statute
in
the
district
of
columbia.
now,
the
government
agrees
that
the
second
degree
is
not
a
lesser
included
offense
and
we
don't
understand
how
they
can
fail
to
see
that
arson
--
mr.
blow
yes
--
yes,
your
honor,
i'm
sorry.
under
this
indictment
unless
the
defendant
were
proved
guilty
of
arson,
he
could
not
be
guilty
of
murder
and
perhaps
he
could
be
guilty
of
nothing
because
the
killing
in
itself
was
never
alleged
to
be
anything
but
accidental.
and
the
trouble
that
we
have
at
the
second
trial
illustrates
the
degree
to
which
arson
and
first
degree
murder
are
intertwined
in
this
case.
the
judge
told
the
district
attorney,
he
couldn't
introduce
the
conviction
of
arson
under
count
one,
to
impeach
the
credibility
of
the
defendant
when
he
was
tried
on
count
two.
the
judge
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
told
the
jury,
having
them
the
indictment
which
was
in
two
counts
to
disregard
the
first
count,
block
one
but
then
instructed
them
that
in
order
to
find
guilt
under
the
second,
they
had
to
find
every
single
element
of
the
offense
of
arson
that
was
contained
in
the
first
count.
they
put
the
man
in
the
position
of
being
tried
for
an
offense
at
the
same
time
that
he
was
serving
his
sentence
for
having
committed
it.
the
government
says
that
arson
was
not
a
lesser
included
offense
and
in
support
of
this,
it
devote
several
pages
of
its
brief
to
an
analysis
of
new
york
cases
which
deal
with
assault.
now,
new
york,
they
--
they
attempt
to
prove
that
the
felony
has
to
be
distinct
from
the
killing.
but
new
york
holds
that
assault
is
a
felony
and
their
statute
is
in
such
form
that
any
killing
which
occurs
in
the
perpetration
of
a
felony
is
first
degree
murder.
therefore,
since
every
killing
involves
an
assault,
they
found
themselves
in
a
position
where
logically
every
murder
was
first
degree
murder
and
there
could
be
no
degrees
of
murder.
well,
to
that
extent,
the
new
york
courts
concluded
that
the
felony
has
to
be
a
slightly
different
offense,
those
cases
are
assault
cases.
and
--
and
new
york
found
itself
in
a
very
particular
box
there
because
their
statute
unlike
ours
does
not
enumerate
the
felonies
which
have
to
be
proved.
now,
putting
aside
the
question
whether
arson
is
a
lesser
included
offense
or
not,
the
court
below
and
the
government
cite
the
test
which
has
been
accepted
by
this
court.and
that
test
was
laid
down
by
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
in
morey
versus
commonwealth
and
it
provides,
"if
each
statute
requires
proof
of
an
additional
fact
which
the
other
does
not,
an
acquittal
or
a
conviction
under
either
statute
does
not
exempt
the
defendant
from
prosecution
and
punishment
onto
the
other."
well,
of
course
that's
true.
but
here,
only
one
statute,
2401
which
define
felony
murder
as
the
killing
which
occurred
in
perpetration
of
one
of
the
felonies
enumerated
in
401,
only
one
statute
require
proof
of
an
additional
fact.
that
offense
we
--
we
can't
help
but
conclude,
is
the
greater
offense.
naturally,
it
has
one
more
element.
but
--
but
arson
had
to
be
proved
in
this
trial
for
the
defendant
to
be
guilty
of
anything
and
he
was
convicted
of
arson
at
his
first
trial.
he
never
appealed
that
conviction.he
served
his
sentence,
all
of
it.
now,
if
--
if
your
first
amendment
is
designed
to
avoid
multiplicity
of
the
suits
as
we
think
it
is,
we
--
we
reach
the
rule
that
the
government
has
to
take
its
biggest
bite
at
the
defendant
the
first
time.
now,
this
is
of
course
what
the
government
did.
it
took
its
biggest
bite
but
it
didn't
get,
it
got
the
lesser
and
the
lesser
was
arson
and
they
should
let
matters
rest
there
because
the
government
has
no
right
of
appeal
in
the
united
states.
i'm
passing
back
quickly
to
our
alternative
arguments
now
which
are
the
improper
admission
testimony
and
the
misconduct
of
the
prosecutor
in
the
closing
moments
of
the
trial.
we
have
outlined
the
events
which
occurred
in
this
case
from
the
moment
this
man
was
picked
out
of
this
burning
building
until
he
was
finally
brought
before
a
committing
officer.
in
effect
when
he
had
got
to
the
committing
officer
and
the
committing
officer
advised
him
that
he
was
under
suspicion,
that
he
had
a
right
to
counsel,
that
he
had
a
right
not
to
make
a
statement
and
that
he
had
a
right
--
that
any
statement
used
might
be
used
against
him,
it
was
too
late.
the
--
the
horse
was
being
stolen
before
--
before
the
door
was
closed.
now,
the
majority
of
the
court
below
held
that
delay
in
arraigning
a
suspect
cannot
be
unreasonable
delay
or
illegal
detention,
when
he
is
in
the
hospital.
now,
it's'
true
of
course
that
this
--
this
court
was
concerned
in
mcnabb
versus
the
united
states
with
someone
who
could
have
been
brought
before
the
committing
magistrate
and
be
advise.
but
here,
this
fellow,
assuming
for
purposes
of
argument
was
--
could
not
be
brought
before
the
committing
magistrate
on
the
day
of
his
arrest.
perhaps,
it's
--
it's
more
questionable
as
to
the
28th,
they
interrogated
him
two
hours
before
taking
him.
nevertheless
--
mr.
blow
yes,
your
honor.
he
was
released
in
the
custody
of
the
police
at
11
a.m.
on
may
28th
but
he
was
interrogated
at
9
a.m.
on
may
28.
that's
when
he
made
those
extravagant
remarks,
"stop
blowing
up
the
house
and
blowing
his
brains
out."
mr.
blow
yes,
that's
correct.
and
before
he
had
been
advised.
mr.
blow
that
was
questioning
by
the
police.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
blow
if
in
fact
the
police
could
not
have
taken
him
to
the
committing
magistrate
before
11.
the
--
the
doctor
testified
that
--
that
he
was
released
at
11
for
the
convenience
of
the
police,
were
prepared
to
admit
that
he
couldn't
have
been
taken
before
11.
because
we
think
that
the
purpose
of
rule
5
and
what
this
court
had
in
mind
in
mcnabb
versus
the
united
states
was
something
very
much
bigger
than
simply
holding
on
to
a
man
so
he
--
or
presenting
him
to
the
committing
magistrate
so
that
they
could
file
a
complaint.
they
were
thinking
of
rule
what
after
all
is
the
purpose
of
rule
5,
it's
to
get
the
man
to
the
commissioner
so
that
he
can
be
advised
in
accordance
with
rule
5
(b)
that
he
has
these
vital
rights
which
he
cannot
be
presumed
to
understand.
and
--
mr.
blow
the
court
below
concedes
that
not
until
36
hours
after
they
picked
him
up
did
they
have
sufficient
evidence
on
which
to
base
a
complaint.
we
just
don't
know
whether
--
whether
they
were
holding
him
for
that
purpose
or
not.
it's
certainly
clear,
i
think,
they
knew
from
the
very
--
your
suspected
from
the
very
beginning
that
this
was
their
man
and
that
they
wanted
a
confession
out
of
him.
mr.
blow
your
honor,
this
man
send
his
last
$40
in
that
latter
to
provide
for
flowers
for
the
old
lady's
funeral.
he
had
no
means
at
all.
mr.
blow
oh,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
blow
no,
your
honor.
he
was
attended
by
the
police
during
both
of
his
interrogations
at
emergency
and
taken
under
guard
--
mr.
blow
--
to
the
strong
room
at
the
district
of
columbia
general
hospital.
there's
a
locked
barred
room
in
which
you
need
the
police
permission
to
enter.
it's
jail
--
it's
jail.
mr.
blow
yes,
your
honor.
that
he
was
taken
there
that
afternoon
and
kept
there
and
through
the
next
and
into
the
next
day
when
he
was
finally
admitted,
and
finally
warned.
mr.
blow
why
yes,
your
honor.
this
was
jail.
it
was
jail
for
sick
and
wounded
prisoners
but
it
was
jail.
there
is
no
doubt
of
that.
is
--
it
was
--
that
door
was
barred
and
locked
and
he
couldn't
get
out,
and
he
couldn't
see
a
lawyer,
and
he
couldn't
see
any
friend.
and
he
hadn't
the
faintest
idea
what
was
going
on.
mr.
blow
i
think
he
was
under
arrest
at
(inaudible)
in
the
morning,
your
honor.
i
think
he
was
under
arrest
one
hour
after
he
was
picked
out
of
that
house.
when
--
when
the
detective
sergeant
picked
up
the
telephone
and
told
the
third
precinct
to
send
a
man
over,
i
think
he
said,
"to
guard
this
gentleman."
i
--
we
submit
he
was
under
arrest.
and
for
a
man
who
was
deprived
on
his
back
of
--
suffering
from
smoke
inhalation
of
stab
wounds
in
his
chest,
stab
wounds
in
his
neck.you
don't
need
very
many
policemen
to
guard
him.
and
he
--
we
nevertheless,
maintained
he
was
under
arrest
at
that
time.
mr.
blow
no,
your
honor.
we
--
mr.
blow
--
we
agreed
with
the
government
that
there
are
occasions
when
they
have
for
a
minute.
mr.
blow
in
this
case
--
in
this
case,
they
could
question
him
but
if
they
intended
to
use
the
results
of
that
questioning
against
him
and
failed
to
advise
him
of
his
rights,
the
conclusion
is
inescapable
that
they
didn't
advise
him
because
they
wanted
to
get
something
out
of
him
and
they
wanted
to
use
it
against
him.
we
think
it
would
not
be
unreasonable,
your
honor,
for
every
policemen
who
stands
of
the
district
court
to
testify.
before
he's
allowed
to
testify
as
to
confessions
or
any
other
requirements
that
before
he
asked
a
question,
he
told
the
defendant
that
he
had
a
right
to
counsel,
a
right
not
to
make
the
statement
and
warned
him
to
the
fact
--
warned
him
of
the
fact
that
it
might
be
used
against
him.
mr.
blow
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
they
--
to
my
knowledge,
they
don't
go
out
and
get
the
committing
magistrate
and
bring
him
there
though
that's
not
an
unreasonable
thought
either.
mr.
blow
if
they
just
--
mr.
blow
that's
all
we
asked,
your
honor,
and
that
every
policeman
in
british
isles
and
the
british
territories
will
do
and
has
to
do
by
rule
of
court.
now
--
mr.
blow
we're
prepared
to
admit,
your
honor,
that
this
man
was
too
ill
to
be
taken
for
a
committing
magistrate,
the
police
before
9
o'clock
on
the
morning
of
may
28th
when
he
was
interrogated
for
the
last
time.
we
think,
perhaps,
that
if
a
man
was
well
enough
to
be
taken
out
of
the
hospital
at
11,
he
could
be
taken
out
at
9
when
the
committing
magistrate
was
sitting.
nevertheless,
our
--
our
point
is
--
nevertheless,
the
-
the
vital
importance
of
these
rights
and
the
knowledge
of
these
rights
and
the
extreme
simplicity
of
requiring
the
police
to
give
and
the
fairness
of
it.
now,
your
honor
in
--
in
just
a
minute,
i
would
like
to
discuss
very
briefly
the
closing
moments
of
the
trial
or
our
fourth
point.
the
defense
had
finished
its
summation,
had
told
the
jury
that
whatever
they
individually
regarded
as
the
facts
of
the
case
that
would
bind
everything,
that
there
is
--
was
a
job
to
determine
the
facts
of
the
case.
and
the
district
attorney
has
the
final
word
in
the
criminal
case.
he
represents
the
united
states
and
he
has
the
final
word.
now,
we
find
in
this
record
remarks
which
he
made
which
says
the
fact,
the
jury
didn't
have
to
regard
the
consequences
of
this
verdict
that
of
the
trial
judge
would
look
in
the
facts
that
--
that
the
court
of
appeals
would
look
the
facts
over,
would
sift
the
facts
of
the
case
and
decide
by
fifth
amendment
(inaudible)
that
this
court
if
it
saw
fit
would
look
the
facts
over
and
decide
whether
he
went
to
the
electric
chair.
that
there
was
the
president
of
the
united
states,
that
was
the
attorney
general
or
these
remarks
on
page
154
of
the
record,
we
submit
that
after
the
district
attorney
got
through
them,
the
jury
must
have
wondered
why
they
where
there
at
all.
if
your
honor
please,
i'd
like
to
save
a
few
minutes.
mr.
blow
your
honor,
if
i
may.
i
would
like
to
make
a
very
short
comment
on
--
mr.
blow
--
on
the
common
law
and
our
question
of
waiver.
we
divested
the
laws
and
the
positions
taken
by
the
court's,
48
states
in
this
country.
when
they
were
faced
with
this
waiver
problem
of
jeopardy
and
we
concluded
that
the
common
law
courts
found
that
there
would
be
no
way
presumed
in
an
appeal
beyond
that
of
free
trial
on
the
degree
of
offense
for
which
the
man
was
previously
convicted,
that
we
said
is
the
common
law
rule.
we
submit
that
the
court
is
bound
by
the
common
law
rule
since
--
as
it
has
frequently
said,
the
constitution
can
only
be
understood
and
interpreted
in
light
of
the
common
law
rule
and
the
condition
existing
at
the
time
the
framers
of
the
constitution
wrote
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
blow
your
honor
--
mr.
blow
they
could
have
arisen
--
we
--
we
understand
by
--
by
legislative
grace.
there
were
occasionally
appeals
in
england
because
blackstone
saw
fit
to
comment
that
a
man
convicted
on
one
count
and
acquitted
as
to
two
on
a
retrial
could
not
be
convicted
of
the
one
of
which
he
had
been
acquitted.
in
other
words,
he
couldn't
be
retried
on
that
account.
now,
blackstone
said
--
and
blackstone
had
sold
more
copies
in
america
than
he
sold
in
--
in
england.
mr.
blow
i
think
--
mr.
blow
i
--
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
blow
we
have,
we
have
--
we
have
--
mr.
blow
from
the
standpoint
of
early
history
of
--
mr.
blow
--
contemporary
with
the
adoption
of
the
fifth
amendment?
mr.
blow
not
--
your
honor,
we
have
--
we
have
the
views
of
the
courts
that
thereafter
took
a
look
at
the
fifth
amendment.
but
the
--
mr.
blow
--
the
court
--
mr.
blow
we
--
we
have
the
views
of
the
common
law
courts
in
the
--
mr.
blow
--
in
america,
state
courts.
that
took
a
look
at
the
common
law
rule
which
said
no
second
jeopardy
--
mr.
blow
--
and
said
we
have
this
--
this
reasonable
waiver
--
mr.
blow
--
which
will
imply.
mr.
blow
we
have
baxter
on
the
general
question.
mr.
blow
yes,
and
--
mr.
blow
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
is
here
upon
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
it
began
over
four
years
ago
when
a
fire
was
discovered
at
the
petitioner's
residence
on
massachusetts
avenue.
now
it
was
may
26,
1953.
upon
their
arrival
at
the
burning
house,
the
fireman
found
two
people
present
in
the
house.
one
was
the
petitioner
who
was
found
evidently
unconscious,
lying
in
the
basement
bathtub
of
his
house
and
the
other
was
the
deceased
ms.
bettie
brown,
who
was
pronounced
dead
on
being
taken
out
of
the
house.
the
petitioner
was
taken
out
of
the
house,
was
administered
oxygen,
was
taken
to
emergency
hospital
and
was
there
laid
upon
an
examining
table.
that
was
approximately
9
a.m.
on
the
morning
of
may
26,
1953.
now
between
that
period
and
10
o'clock
on
the
morning
of
may
28,
the
defendant
was
questioned
intermittently
by
two
officers
of
the
homicide
squad
of
the
metropolitan
police
department
and
by
the
inspector
of
the
fire
department
in-charge
of
the
investigating
causes
of
arson.
and
since
this
house
was
locked
and
all
windows
secured
when
the
firemen
arrived,
and
since
there
were
evidently
five
or
six
separate
fires,
the
evidence
or
the
information
of
any
officer
investigating
this
fire
was
that
arson
had
been
committed.
at
any
rate,
on
may
28th
at
approximately
10
--
11
o'clock
in
the
morning,
the
defendant
was
taken
before
the
deputy
coroner
and
advised
in
accordance
with
rule
5(b)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
that
he
had
a
right
not
to
make
a
statement,
that
any
statement
he
used
might
be
used
against
him,
that
he
had
a
right
to
counsel.
soon
after
this,
the
grand
jury
met
and
returned
an
indictment
against
the
petitioner
in
two
counts.
now
the
first
--
this
indictment
is
on
pages
two
and
three
of
the
record
and
it's
vitally
important,
because
the
first
count
read,
“on
or
about
may
26,
1953
within
the
district
of
columbia,
everett
d.
green
maliciously
did
burn
and
cause
to
be
burnt
a
building
known
as
1115
massachusetts
avenue
north
west
property
of
gerald
green”
and
the
second
count
incorporated
that
language,
and
it
read,
“on
or
about
may
26,
1953
within
the
district
of
columbia,
everett
d.
green
committed
the
offense
of
arson,
that
is
to
say,
he
maliciously
did
burn
or
caused
to
be
burnt
a
certain
building
known
as
1115
massachusetts
avenue
north
west,
property
of
gerald
green;
and
in
perpetration
of
the
offense
of
arson
aforesaid
caused
bettie
brown
to
inhale
certain
gas,
the
inhalation
of
which
resulted
in
her
death
within
the
district
of
columbia
on
or
about
may
26,
1953.”
thus,
while
the
first
count
charged
the
petitioner
with
the
offense
of
arson
under
section
401
of
the
district
of
columbia
code,
the
second
count
charged
him
with
two
offenses,
one
the
same
arson
and
two
the
offense
of
arson
killing
as
defined
in
section
2401
of
the
district
code
which
provides,
whoever
being
of
sound
memory
or
discretion
without
purpose
so
to
do,
kills
another
in
perpetrating
or
in
attempting
to
perpetrate
any
arson,
as
defined
in
section
401
of
this
code
is
guilty
of
murder
in
the
first
degree.
now
the
petitioner
was
tried
upon
this
two
count
indictment
and
the
jury
was
instructed
on
the
law
of
arson
and
they
were
instructed
that
if
they
found
in
the
perpetration
of
this
arson
the
deceased
died
through
the
inhalation
of
certain
gases
produced
by
fumes,
they
were
to
return
a
verdict
of
first
degree
murder
under
the
district
of
columbia
code.
the
judge,
on
his
own
motion,
instructed
the
jury
on
second
degree
murder.
now
the
jury
retired
and
they
came
back
and
they
found,
“we
find
the
defendant
everett
d.
green
guilty
of
arson,
we
find
the
defendant
guilty
of
second
degree
murder
on
the
second
count.”
the
arson
stand,
it
was
never
appealed
and
the
sentence
one
the
arson
now
has
been
served.
but
he
did
appeal
his
conviction
of
second
degree
murder
and
in
his
appeal
he
urged
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
of
his
trial
that
would
sustain
a
conviction
of
second
degree
murder
and
he
urged
that
the
giving
of
that
instruction
permitted
the
government,
permitted
the
jury
rather
to
resolve
any
doubt
that
they
may
have
had
as
to
the
cause
of
the
death
of
the
deceased
in
the
favor
of
the
united
states.
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
reversing
said
one,
the
giving
of
the
second
degree
murder
instruction
where
there
is
no
evidence
to
warrant
it,
is
technically
erroneous;
two
it
was
prejudicial
because
here
and
i
quote,
“here
had
the
erroneous
instruction
under
which
he
was
convicted
not
been
given,
green
might
have
been
found
not
guilty
under
the
second
count.”
the
case
was
remanded
to
the
district
court
and
once
it
became
evident
that
the
government
was
going
to
proceed
the
second
time,
under
first
degree
murder
charge,
the
defendant
interposed
a
plea
a
former
jeopardy.
that
plea
being
overruled
he
was
tried
the
second
time
and
convicted
this
time
of
first
degree
murder
as
originally
charged.
now,
we
contend
that
the
government
was
not
privileged
to
prove
a
second
time
what
it
had
been
unable
to
prove
before
the
first
jury
and
to
support
this
contention
we
have
briefed
four
arguments,
two
of
these
are
constitutional.
the
first
proceeds
from
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
was
in
undoubted
jeopardy
of
his
life
on
the
offense
of
first
degree
arson
and
murder
at
his
first
trial,
and
this
argument
concerned
the
extent
of
the
waiver
of
the
defense
of
former
jeopardy
that
is
going
to
be
presumed
to
attach
to
the
exercise
of
an
appeal.
mr.
blow
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
blow
that
is
correct
your
honor.
i
understand
that
--
mr.
blow
yeah,
the
law
is
a
little
unsettled
whether
or
not
the
government
would
be
permitted
to
come
back
and
say
we
have
evidence
now
of
second
degree
murder
and
try
him
again
for
second,
we
don't
know
about
that.
mr.
blow
well
your
honor
--
mr.
blow
which
possibility
your
honor?
mr.
blow
i
don't
believe
that
would
have
been
your
honor.
possible
yes
and
no,
but
we
have
not
investigated
that,
because
that
again
would
be
a
question
which
we
would
determine
in
the
trial
court,
before
the
trial
justice
by
a
motion.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
might
have
either
directed
an
acquittal
being
satisfied
that
there
was
no
evidence
whatsoever
of
second
degree,
or
it
might
have
said,
we'll
send
it
back
and
let
the
court,
the
trial
court
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
evidence
of
(inaudible).
our
second
jeopardy
argument
your
honor
speaking
of
what
in
this
case
is
the
necessarily
lesser
included
offense
in
that
indictment
which
we've
just
read,
proceeds
on
the
assumption
or
on
the
evident
response
to
this
--
to
reading
this
indictment,
that
incorporated
in
the
second
count
is
the
lesser,
necessarily
lesser
included
event
of
arson.
mr.
blow
no,
your
honor,
it
does
in
the
sense
that
we
think
we
have
a
stronger
case
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
second
degree
was
not
in
our
opinion
a
lesser
included
offence
in
this
indictment,
because
we
are
in
the
position
of
a
totally
unrelated
event.
we're
not
even
covered
by
the
indictment
as
the
government
admits.
the
government
admits
that
second
degree
would
not
be
covered
by
the
indictment
in
this
case.
mr.
blow
yes
your
honor
definitely.
mr.
blow
because
it
puts
the
man
--
say
the
man
was
convicted
of
arson
and
adultery
and
he
said
i'm
not
guilty
of
adultery
whatever
else,
and
he
--
and
what
i
would
i
do,
i
would
go
to
him
and
say
you're
taking
your
chance
on
your
life
by
appealing
this
offense.
mr.
blow
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
blow
yes
your
honor,
and
that
was
the
result
which
the
--
as
pointed
in
--
by
dissenting
justices
in
trono
represented
the
overwhelming
ways
of
american
decided
opinions,
court
opinions
certainly
up
to
--
certainly
through
the
19th
century
and
even
today
represent
the
overwhelming
court
opinion.
mr.
blow
your
honor?
mr.
blow
well,
your
honor
with
--
mr.
blow
your
honor
we
have
investigated
them
in
our
appendix
a.
mr.
blow
every
state
in
the
union,
and
we
found
six
we
couldn't
find
your
honor,
that
we
found
--
mr.
blow
well
your
honor
in
our
appendix,
on
appendix
a,
we
have
set
them
out
in
tables
those
courts
which
found
the
result,
absent
any
statute
or
constitutional
amendment,
and
13
are
in
our
table,
which
have
never
departed
from
what
we
call
the
limited
waiver
doctrine,
that
is
the
doctrine
that
in
permitting
a
new
trial
out
of
the
constitutional
prohibition
against
second
jeopardy
or
the
waiver
if
there
was
to
be
one,
would
be
presumed
to
extend
no
further
than
the
need
of
the
present,
that
in
construing
your
constitutional
right,
you
don't
construe
it
any
further
than
its
benefit
to
the
defendant,
you
don't
(inaudible)
mr.
blow
sir?
mr.
blow
no.
well
we
have
13
your
honor
at
page
45
of
our
brief
that
have
never
departed
from
this
limited
waiver
doctrine.
we
have
five
that
have
adhered
to
the
limited
waiver
doctrine
even
though
the
statute
in
this
day
tried
to
change
it
and
we
have
five
which
followed
it
prior
to
the
enactment
of
some
statute,
prior
to
some
constitutional
amendment.
now
kring
versus
missouri
is
an
example
of
that.
there
was
--
the
state
followed
the
limited
waiver
rule
up
to
1880
or
slightly
before
when
by
constitutional
amendment
they
made
a
new
trial,
one,
a
completely
new
proceeding,
they
maybe
effect
of
a
new
trial,
a
complete
washing
out
of
the
earlier
trial,
including
the
washing
out
of
the
earlier
implied
acquittal
and
this
court
in
kring
versus
missouri
said
all
right
missouri
you
can
do
that,
and
you
can
do
that
by
attorney
--
because
you
are
now
covered
by
the
fifth
amendment,
you
can
do
that
even
by
a
statute,
as
well
as
a
constitutional
amendment,
that
it's
a
matter
of
substance,
you
can't
do
it
retroactively.
you
can't
do
it
for
someone
who
was
tried
for
an
offense
committed
during
the
time
when
the
limited
waiver
rule
was
in
effect.
mr.
blow
your
honor
we
come
back
to
these
cases
in
connection
with
a
third
argument
which
--
mr.
blow
well
your
honor
we
are
going
to
discuss
in
connection
and
mention
these
cases
again
perhaps
in
connection
with
our
third
argument
which
we
briefed
in
our
supplemental
brief.
mr.
blow
i
see
your
honor.
well,
we
have
our
third
point
which
we
are
going
to
discuss
and
that
relates
to
the
principles
of
collateral
estoppel
as
set
forth
in
recent
decisions
of
this
court.
it
leaves
aside
constitutional
concerns.
we
are
going
to
make
the
argument
that
the
government
was
barred
from
--
by
collateral
estoppel,
from
attempting
a
second
time
to
prove
what
they
couldn't
prove
the
first
time,
and
finally
we
are
going
to
talk
about
jurisdiction.
we
are
going
to
say
that
when
the
court
was
granted
appellate
power
over
criminal
cases,
then
at
that
time
we
look
to
the
state
of
the
law
in
the
common
law
of
court,
and
that
time
it
was
1889.
and
was
then
--
of
course
these
arguments
all
rejected
we
come
to
question
of
whether
or
not
if
there
was
to
be
a
second
trial,
it
was
a
fair
trial
and
in
that
connection
we
mentioned
statements
admitted,
statements
that
the
police
and
fire
department
inspectors
in
the
case
admitted
which
we
think
are
properly
excludable
under
the
mcnabb
rule
and
we
call
to
this
court's
attention,
certain
remarks
which
were
made
by
the
prosecutor
in
rebuttal.
now
turning
to
the
first
point,
we
have
to
mention
and
this
is
in
connection
with
our
effort
to
find
some
sort
of
intent
on
the
part
of
the
framers
of
the
constitution.
we
have
to
say
that
at
the
time
of
the
constitution,
new
trials
so
far
as
our
research
discloses
were
not
granted
in
england
in
capital
cases
and
probably
not
in
felony
cases
generally.
so
--
and
this
explains
the
decision
in
united
states
versus
gibert,
as
many
years
as
36
or
more,
after
the
constitution
that
there
could
be
no
new
trial
because
such
a
new
trial
would
place
a
man
twice
in
jeopardy
and
the
constitution
said
he
couldn't
be
placed
twice
in
jeopardy.
in
england
as
we
understand
it,
the
prisoners'
remedy
was
to
call
the
error
of
the
lack
of
evidence
to
the
attention
of
the
crown
and
in
this
sometimes
he
would
evidently
be
carefully
insisted
by
the
trial
court,
but
there
is
no
question
of
a
new
trial
if
he
was
right
then
that
was
the
end
of
it.
we
said
or
the
court
said
in
the
gibert
case
that
there
couldn't
be
a
new
trial
at
all,
but
in
the
federal
courts,
we
have
no
appellate
procedures
in
these
criminal
cases.
and
we
had
no
real
understanding
perhaps
of
what
problems
would
be
involved
if
the
new
trial
were
granted
and
yet
the
defendant
had
been
convicted
at
the
first
trial
of
an
offense
lesser
in
degree
than
that
with
which
he
was
charged
in
the
indictment.
and
we
say
in
that
connection
that
is
where
we
looked
to
our
states
your
honor
and
we
look
to
the
states
for
an
interpretation
of
the
constitution
or
the
--
the
common
law
prohibition
against
second
jeopardy
because
they
had
some
sort
of
appellate
procedure
and
they
have
this
problem.
and
they
said
we
are
going
to
expand
the
constitutional
right,
but
we
are
not,
we
are
not
going
to
leave
it
in
its
contracted
form,
we
are
going
to
expand
it
for
the
benefit
of
the
person.
but
we
are
not
going
to
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
an
appeal
will
waive
what
the
protection
that
the
guy
had
by
virtue
of
his
not
having
been
found
guilty
of
the
higher
charge
on
the
first
time
around.
in
other
words,
we
are
not
going
to
make
a
man
barter,
or
gamble
when
he
appeals
or
when
he
decides
to
appeal.
we,
in
our
brief,
have
distinguished
the
rule
that
obtained
or
could
obtain
in
territorial
courts.
and
we
have
distinguished,
we
have
attempted
to
distinguish
the
rule
that
obtained
and
was
applied
by
this
court
in
trono
versus
the
united
states
where
we
had
a
system
of
law
that
developed
not
from
the
common
law,
but
from
the
spanish
law
where
there
was
no
trial
by
jury
and
where
as
trono
was
--
he
was
tried
by
magistrate,
a
trial
magistrate
without
a
jury.
the
case
was
appealed
in
accordance
with
procedures
established
by
congress
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
(inaudible)
and
his
conviction
was
reversed.
without
remanding
the
case
at
all,
a
new
determination
of
facts
was
made
by
the
appellate
court,
a
new
offense
was
found
to
have
been
committed
and
a
new
sentence
was
imposed.
well
this
is
an
entirely
foreign
procedure
to
us.
and
one
of
the
justices,
justice
brown
who
concurred
in
the
opinion
of
this
court
of
mr.
justice
peckham
in
affirming
those
convictions
said,
one
year
earlier
in
kepner
he
made
it
clear
and
he
wasn't
going
to
trust
a
trial
magistrate
in
the
philippines
with
a
final
power
of
acquitting
a
defendant
charged
with
a
serious
offence
such
as
murder.
and
he
said,
again,
it's
logical
i
think
to
assume
that
he
conferred
in
trono
for
the
same
reason.
he
felt
this
was
a
proper
procedure
and
the
contracts
and
the
history
of
philippine
law
of
territorial,
of
a
territorial
court
established
by
act
of
congress,
the
government
of
philippine.
but
given
the
logic
of
trono
in
the
philippines,
you
have
four
dissenters.
and
those
dissenters
found
as
did
the
majority,
as
did
the
four
in
the
majority,
there
were
four
in
them
all
found
some
sort
of
acquittal,
inherent
in
the
finding
of
the
lower
offense.
now
they
have
admitted
as
all
eight
of
them
proceeding
on
the
assumption
that
the
question
was
one
of
waiver
of
a
right,
in
that
case
a
legislative
right
that
it
was
regarded
as
the
constitutional
right.
the
court
below,
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
has
approached
the
entire
case
from
a
standpoint
of
waiver.
perhaps
with
the
exception
of
mr.
justice,
of
judge
prettyman
you
could
say
safely
that
that
eight
of
the
court
of
appeals
below
were
attacking
this
present
case
on
the
ground
of
waiver.
and
we
have
applied
here
by
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
a
presumptive
absolute
waiver.
the
man
has
been
presumed
to
have
surrendered
the
protection
of
the
constitution
in
exchange
for
the
exercise
of
a
statutory
right
through
appeal
what
he
regarded
as
an
unjust
verdict.
now
we
have
our
question
of
the
lesser
included
offense.
we
take
a
look
at
rule
31(c).
we
say
that
a
man
maybe
convicted
of
any
offense
lesser
than
necessarily
included
in
that
charge.
we
take
a
look
at
this
indictment
and
we
take
a
look
at
ours
and
we
see
that
count
one
is
reproduced
word
for
word
in
count
two
and
that
count
two
adds
on
a
one
element
to
the
events
described,
the
consequent
there
--
that
that's
consequent
upon
the
offense.
now
this
court,
the
government
in
its
brief,
the
court
below,
everyone
recognized
that
the
test
that
has
been
applied
consistently
by
this
court
is
that
in
murray
versus
commonwealth
which
–
wherein
it
was
stated
if
each
statute
requires
proof
of
a
fact
which
the
other
does
not,
an
acquittal
or
conviction
under
either
statute
does
not
exempt
the
defendant
from
prosecution
and
punishment
of
the
guilt.
but
of
course
here
only
one
did,
you
can't
say
the
count
one
required
anything
more
than
count
two,
it
was
a
lesser
included
offense
in
the
count
two.
the
trouble
with
this
whole
thing
was
pointed
out
in
the
trial
court
where
the
judge
handed
the
indictment
of
the
jury
and
said
you
will
disregard
count
one,
charged
in
count
two.
mr.
blow
well
you
--
mr.
justice
holmes
we
believe
concurred
in
trono
because
he
felt
that
jeopardy
was
one
long
piece
of
strength
from
the
very
moment
the
case
started
until
very
moment
that
the
sentence
was
executed
or
those
defendants
put
on
the
street.
he
was
not
sympathetic
to
waiver.
he
said
it
was
wrong
to
assume
that
any
man
would
consciously
waive
something
like
a
fundamental
constitutional
right.
well
we
say
that
justice
holmes
was
tackling
this
problem
in
a
way
that
would
permit
a
new
trial
continually
no
matter
who
was
prejudiced.
the
object
being
to
get
a
trial
free
from
error,
it
made
no
difference
we
understand
from
justice
holmes'
position
of
waiver
whether
it
was
the
government
was
hurt
or
the
prisoner,
if
one
was
hurt
there
should
be
a
new
trial.
now
our
answer
to
justice
holmes'
argument
has
to
be
that
that
is
not
the
law
that
the
government
is
not
permitted
an
appeal
--
mr.
blow
well
he
did
say
that
congress
could
--
he
did
suggest
that
congress
might
be
able
to
change
the
law
and
i
suppose
that's
been
suggested
even
in
palko
versus
connecticut
that
no
one
has
ever
been
quite
sure
whether
congress
could
or
not.
mr.
blow
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
blow
we
take
him
out
because
he
was
a
swing
man
--
mr.
blow
yes
except
that
it
didn't
come
to
the
point
of
saying
that
a
man
could
be
tried
for
--
could
not
tried
for
a
capital
offense
without
a
jury.
mr.
blow
we
have
that
question
too,
yes.
mr.
blow
well
they
did
your
honor.
the
four
justices
did
and
five
justices
didn't
and
the
other
four
were
little
bit
afraid
by
the
expression
in
the
majority
opinion
that
that
this
was
law
that
was
going
to
be
applied
in
the
federal
courts.
mr.
blow
that
the
government
has
no
appeal.
mr.
blow
no,
no
your
honor.
mr.
blow
that
the
government
should
try
to
appeal
--
mr.
blow
the
question
whether
a
government
would
be
permitted
--
mr.
blow
well
that
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
mr.
blow
well
it
came
up
in
kepner
in
philippine
connection
and
it
came
up
again
in
the
palko
versus
connecticut
connection
where
connecticut
does
allow
an
appeal
by
the
government
for
error
in
trial.
mr.
blow
that
was
a
fourteenth
amendment
case
and
at
first
they
decided
that.
mr.
blow
well
justice,
mr.
justice
holmes
quoted,
he
said
by
rationale
he
said,
we
should
follow
the
well
reasoned
decisions
of
the
connecticut
supreme
court
in
the
state
versus
lee
that
he
was
lonely
in
saying
that,
because
state
versus
lee
was
the
--
was
one
of
the
earliest
connecticut
cases
approving
the
right
of
the
government
to
appeal.
mr.
blow
yes.
leaving
aside
for
a
very
quick
moment,
the
constitutional
concern,
we
refer
to
the
rule
which
this
court
had
occasion
to
examine
in
yates
versus
united
states
that
and
i
quote,
“a
party
may
be
precluded
under
the
doctrine
of
collateral
estoppel
from
attempting
a
second
time
to
prove
a
fact
that
he
sought
unsuccessfully
to
prove
in
a
prior
action.”
now
this
court
has
agreed
that
the
non-existence
of
a
fact
as
well
as
its
existence
can
constitute
--
can
be
established
by
a
judgment
and
in
the
instant
case
it
must
be
kept
in
mind
throughout
that
the
government
had
a
clear
crack
at
the
defendants
the
first
time
before
12
competent
jurors
and
it
didn't
succeed
in
proving
the
(inaudible).
and
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
from
that
that
the
first
verdict
which
was
silent
on
the
subject
of
arson
killing
required
as
a
determination
of
mixed
fact
and
law,
those
magic
words,
essential
to
be
the
decision,
the
finding
that
death
had
not
been
caused
in
the
manner
alleged.
now
that
is
true
even
--
at
the
same
time
you
can
say
that
the
conviction
of
second
degree
meant
by
looking
at
the
jury's
reaction
is
one
properly
interpreting
its
instruction
as
a
specific
finding
that
he
committed
that
he
killed
her
in
some
other
way,
but
we
don't
press
that
as
hard
as
we
do
the
silence
of
the
jury
of
the
fact
that
the
government
couldn't
prove
its
case
once
and
did
the
second
time.
now
the
government
had
a
little
better
case
the
second
time.
they
found
the
doctor
who
examined
the
deceased
and
they
found
the
chemist
who
looked
at
the
blood
and
they
prepared
their
testimony
and
together
brought
up
all
the
ammunition
on
the
second
time
round
it
was
quite
good
enough
with
this
convict
--
the
defendant
--
mr.
blow
that
is
correct
your
honor,
and
we
subscribe
wholeheartedly
to
that.
now
finally
so
far
as
propriety
of
a
second
trial
is
concerned
we
look
to
the
statute
which
granted
jurisdiction
to
this
court
to
review
capital
cases
and
we
see
that
that
statute
was
passed
in
1889.
that
statute
provided
that
a
case
might
be
remanded
under
the
direction
from
this
court
but
in
looking
at
the
statute
and
interpreting
a
jurisdictional
statute,
we
have
to
look
to
the
state
of
the
law
at
the
time
we
have.
and
we
may
differ
but
we
think
that,
that
reference
to
the
cases
in
our
opinion
will
show
that
the
state
of
the
law
at
the
time
certainly
the
state
court
law,
followed
the
limited
waiver
and
would
not
require
the
gamble,
the
desperate
chance
which
the
court
of
appeals
said
here
was
in
inherent
in
the
exercise
of
the
statutory
right
to
appeal.
and
we
think
that
after
that
statute
of
1889
there
was
no
further
authority
given
to
this
court,
indeed
absent
any
congressional
intent,
we
look
to
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice,
we
find
out
that
green
if
he
has
been
in
the
military
service
couldn't
have
been
retried
for
first
degree,
couldn't
have
been
sentenced
to
death,
and
we
see
that,
that
was
passed
in
1950.
it
certainly
is
other
than
a
congressional
approval
of
a
jurisdictional
power
to
remand
for
retrial
on
an
offence
greater
than
that
embodied
in
the
conviction
appeal.
very
quickly
we
want
to
review
our
alternative
argument
that
if
a
new
trial
was
proper,
this
one
wasn't
fair.
we
note
in
our
brief
on
page
31
the
assertions
which
were
testified
to
by
government
witnesses,
which
we
felt
very
damaging,
the
rights
of
the
accused.
the
government
contends
that
there
were
some
of
these
that
were
not
confirmed
that
denied
by
the
prisoner
at
his
trial.
we
cite,
in
addition
we
cite
particularly
the
fact
that
the
defendant
told
sergeant
future
that
he
had
written
a
letter
advertising
suicide
just
before
they
smelt
smoke.
we
note
that
the
defendant
said
he
mailed
that
letter
at
12:30
at
night.
we
note
that
judge
bazelon
dissenting
in
the
court
below
pointed
out
that
if
the
jury
believed
that
the
defendant
has
said
what
sergeant
future
said
he
said,
it's
whole
story
became
incredible
and
ridiculous.
we
note
these
remarks
about
blowing
up
the
house,
on
may
28th
before
(inaudible).
we
note
in
our
introduction
to
this
mcnabb
section
of
our
brief,
the
fact
that
officers
and
the
fire
inspector
testified
that
he
had
left
the
top
floor
had
gone
directly
to
the
basement.
we
note
that
the
defendant
testified
and
had
to
testify
that
he
stopped
on
the
first
floor,
made
a
telephone
call,
it
was
unsuccessful,
he
notified
people
(inaudible).
we
have
throughout
this
record
as
shown
by
the
assertion
from
page
31
of
our
brief,
tremendous
prejudice.
the
conclusion
is
innocent,
but
that
the
government
knew
what
the
defendant
was
going
to
say
and
had
to
say
at
his
second
trial,
set
the
testimony
of
the
officers
and
the
inspectors
out
to
make
green
look
like
a
liar
before
it
ever
(inaudible),
maybe
that's
what
they
did.
now
this
court,
at
that
time,
of
course
the
timeless
case
was
tried.
you
have
a
5(a)
mcnabb
rule.
it's
been
suggested
and
it's
suggested
very
clearly
in
this
court's
decision
in
mallory
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
5(b)
mcnabb
rule
we
call
it
that
because
we
recognize
the
purpose
after
all
of
a
5(a)
mcnabb
rule
is
to
get
a
man
judicial
caution
or
some
sort
of
caution
before
he
puts
his
head
in
the
noose.
here
he
put
his
head
in
the
noose
before
he
was
committed
two-and-a-half
days
after
he
was
under
surveillance,
under
custody
of
the
police
department.
this
result,
i
believe
was
contemplated
by
this
--
this
problem
i
believe
was
in
the
court's
mind,
has
been
in
this
court's
mind.
the
purpose
of
rule
5
is
twofold.
there
must
be
probable
cause
determined.
the
defendant
must
be
advised
of
his
rights.
the
government
admits
that
there
was
opportunity
for
the
extortion
of
confession
here.
they
say
the
police
didn't
create
it.
we
say
that's
irrelevant.
at
least
they
can
do
as
judge
bazelon
below
suggested
as
the
british
invariably
do
is
once
they
put
him
into
custody,
advised
him
of
his
right
to
silence,
of
his
right
to
counsel,
of
the
fact
that
the
statements
he
made
would
be
used
against
him.
finally
we
have
remarks
which
we
urge
as
prejudicially
unfair
to
the
defendant
at
the
conclusion
of
his
trial.
the
government
urges
these
remarks
were
provoked
by
--
are
mentioned
on
--
are
limited
in
part
pages
from
a
transcript
of
35
of
the
final
items,
that
these
remarks
of
the
government
were
provoked,
by
our
mention
of
the
electric
chair.
i
don't
--
i'm
not
experienced
in
criminal
law,
but
it
appears
to
us
that
any
counsel
for
a
man
under
a
capital
charge
would
be
delinquent
in
his
duty
to
the
client
if
he
did
not
mention
the
consequence
of
a
verdict
and
that
certainly
when
the
court
instructed
the
jury
that
the
penalty
for
the
crime
is
death,
and
impressed
on
jurors
on
voir
dire
as
shown
by
the
supplemental
briefs
to
a
member
of
the
jury,
that
the
consequence
of
their
verdict
would
be
death.
your
honor
we
would
like
to
save
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
blow
mr.
rublee
is
scheduled.
