justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor,
since
justice
harlan
asked
you
as
to
the
purpose
of
the
district
--
the
meaning
of
what
the
district
court
did
in
the
initial
state,
you
becoming
into
it,
but
that
--
at
this
point
is
just
as
well
--
what
do
you
understand
the
district
court
is
qualifying
to
do
by
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
quite
understand
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
may
i
stop
you
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
the
--
and
subpoena
does
that
in
a
way,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
indicates
what
document
it
was.
it
identifies
the
class
of
documents
and
the
period
for
which
a
disclosure
is
required.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
--
but
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“required
by
--
the
individual
documents
should
use,
if
required
by
the
circumstances.
if
required
by
the
circumstances,
the
individual
documents
should
be
inspected
by
the
judge.”
i
don't
understand
that.
when
are
the
circumstances
not
required,
the
individualization
is
required?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
how
can
you
read
that
sentence,
that
clause?
it
requires
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
could
understand
that
proposition
without
committing
myself
to
it.
but
if
i
were
the
district
judge,
i
wouldn't
so
read
the
instruction.
maybe
i
should,
but
i
--
my
fear
is
not
incapable
of
writing
english,
so
it's
clear.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
not
saying
you
shouldn't
be
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
the
--
where
is
the
description
of
the
--
of
the
categories
that
were
asked
to
be
produced,
mr.
solicitor?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
not
--
is
the
burden
of
--
of
the
court
of
appeals
dissatisfaction
with
the
breadth
of
the
subpoena?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
suppose
the
court
had
said,
“you
don't
have
to
have
court
approval
of
each
individual
document,
you
may
ask
by
categories.”
but
the
range,
the
time
and
period
of
the
desired
documents
is
something
within
the
court's
discretion
and
as
you
--
as
we
view
the
matter,
it
appears
to
us
that
38
months
is
a
little
long,
but
we
think
it
ought
to
be
restricted
for
two
years
that
to
say,
subject
to
the
trial
court's
discretion
when
the
case
get
--
goes
back
on
a
showing
made
by
the
board
that
they
do
need
38
months,
would
you
be
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
wouldn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand
that,
but
you
wouldn't
object
to
that
kind
of
indication
that
the
limits
are
matters
of
judgment,
not
the
whole.
we've
been
just
a
little
too
extensive
and
prove
it
for
the
wider
period
of
the
district
judge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
one
--
may
i
ask
you
one
little
more
question
because
i
think
you're
quite
right
in
saying
this
is
a
far-reaching
importance
in
the
relationship
between
the
administrative
agencies
in
court.
suppose
the
court
had
said,
“the
categories
on
their
face
seemed
--
the
subject
matter
seems
relevant.
the
complaint,
the
complaint
is
within
the
scope
of
the
agency's
power.
therefore,
we
direct
obedience
to
subpoena,
preserving
all
of
the
right
to
the
--
to
the
defendant,”
whatever
he
is
called,
“to
object
to
particular
documents.”
and
if
that
objection
is
made,
that
should
go
to
the
court
for
determination,
would
you
be
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
--
what
you're
objecting
to
is
your
interpretation
of
this
decision
that
if
an
agency
asks
for
a
body
of
documents
which
they
inevitably
must
ask
in
an
inquiry
like
this.
it
isn't
just
one
document,
there
are
two.
if
in
the
normal
course
of
the
body
of
documents,
that
if
on
the
face
of
the
--
of
the
subpoena,
the
subject
matter
indicated
that
the
document
sought
to
be
elicited,
is
relevant
to
the
complaint
of
the
agency.
the
board
doesn't
have
to
justify
each
separate
unit
of
the
body
of
documents.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
interpret
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
to
be
the
opposite
of
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
the
board,
the
--
the
agency,
because
these
applies
to
all
agencies
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
this
rule
prevail.
they
would
themselves
have
to
then
visit
--
should
they
with
themselves
have
to
speculate
as
to
the
relevance
of
each
document,
or
they
could
make
a
call
for
it.
when
it's
a
--
when
it's
challenged,
whatever
the
period
is,
six
months
a
year
is
always
involved
in
these
big
investigation,
the
considerable
body
of
documentation,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
court
would
have
to
pass
on
each
in
relation
to,
he
has
yet
speculated
scope
of
the
inquiry
before
the
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
be
good
enough
to
state
what
you
conceive
to
be
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
gave
them
--
gave
them
some
instructions
or
criteria
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
by
which
they've
decided.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you,
the
district
court
didn't
decide.
how
could
it
be
appealed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
back
for
what,
bring
back
for
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
bring
back
on
what
issue?
you
said
you'd
be
contented
if
it
went
back
to
the
district
court.
what
would
the
district
court
be
doing
if
it
went
back,
from
your
point
of
view?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
that.
i
don't
understand
that
remark.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
i
do
not
understand
what
you
--
i
mean,
i
do
not
get
the
significance
of
what
--
of
what
you've
just
said.
the
board
says,
“we
want
these
documents,”
and
you
just
said
the
board
wasn't
interested
in
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
saying,
i
don't
understand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
you
know
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
don't
--
how
can
we
decide
this
case
on
your
assumption
that
of
course
a
whole
category
of
document
is
something
the
board
really
isn't
interested
in?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
can
i
understand
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
i
can
understand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
just
by
your
--
by
--
by
force
of
the
question
that
you
put?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
--
would
--
would
you
indicate
what
you
think
will
happen
if
this
order
is
reverse?
it
has
to
go
back
to
the
district
court,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
would
you
urge
when
the
case
goes
back
on
the
assumption,
needless
to
say
a
hypothetical
the
starting
point?
all
of
these
cases
reversed
and
remanded
that
district
court
to
further
act.
what
course
do
you
grant
to
pursue
that
or
to
call
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
judge
fee
says
it
does?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
that
proceeding
is
concerned
of
the
--
of
the
government.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understood
the
solicitor
general's
argument
that
is
his
chief
concern.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
asking
the
board
to
justify
the
relevance
of
every
piece
of
paper
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
every
item
of
evidence,
which
he
has.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
there
any
to
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean,
the
subpoena
calls
for
reference.
you
then
--
you
then
--
then
they
didn't
bring
enforced.
i
should
think
they
must
make
out
a
case
no
matter
how
sketchy,
putting
in
evidence
in
the
complaint
on
which
they're
inquiring,
in
which
they
are
engaged.
to
that
end,
we
made
this
call
upon
the
defendants,
whatever
they
are
called
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
they
have
respondent
too,
respondents.
and
so,
we
ask
the
process
of
this
court
to
make
him
deliver.
and
then,
the
judge
looks
at
the
categories
and
judges
it,
relates
it
to
the
frame
of
the
complaint,
on
the
basis
--
and
yes,
this
seems
to
be
a
subject
matter
and
a
period
that
are
relevant,
is
that
right?
would
he
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
his
order.
his
order
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
in
the
terms,
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
we're
reviewing
is
orders
of
courts,
not
talk.
now,
the
order
of
judge
hall
on
page
144
sets
forth
what
it
is
that
he's
ordering
your
clients
to
do.
and
i
do
not
understand
how
he
could
have
ordered
them
to
do
that,
except
on
the
presupposition
that
that
--
that
the
documents,
which
were
ordered
to
be
produced,
are
documents
relevant
to
this
litigation.
i
don't
understand
how
a
judge
can
make
an
order,
otherwise
than
with
that
presupposition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
you
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what's
the
matter
with
that,
if
a
board
having
the
duty
of
making
inquiries?
he
says,
“documents
1,
2,
3,
or
4
or
the
class
of
documents
is
relevant.
and
the
judge
says,
“i
can
take
care
of
it.”
why
do
the
boards
claim
that
it's
relevant,
sufficiently
can
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
he
said
it's
a
judicial
decision
that
it
isn't
relevant.
if
it
isn't
irrelevant,
then
it's
something
indictment
be
called
for.
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
there
neutral
documents
in
this
world?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
you
are
suggesting
that
their
board
is
really
--
the
agencies
are
really
calling
for
a
lot
of
neutral
documents.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
that
is
assuming
that
the
board
would
ask
for
a
lot
of
document
that
they
don't
think
are
relevant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now,
you
divulge.
suppose
this
goes
back,
and
said
they
mustn't
justify.
they
need
not
to
justify
document
by
document.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
debarred
from
saying
to
judge
hall
that
he
will
simply
or
to
simply
this
case,
“your
honor,
we
are
being
asked
to
produce
the
following
category
and
we
like
to
be
heard
while
they
are
not
relevant.”
would
you
be
debarred
from
doing
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
he
may
be
intellectually
--
he
may
be
saying
something
that
intellectually
has
required
evidence.
but
as
a
judge,
he
can't
say
that,
merely
because
you
say,
“these
have
nothing
to
do.”
and
if
the
board
would
be
thinking
about
it,
how
can
a
judge,
district
judge
of
court
of
appeals
of
this
court
say,
“the
board
didn't
think
about
it
and
they
just
harem-scarem,
asked
a
lot
of
documents.”
how
can
we
make
such
a
--
how
can
that
be
a
starting
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
how
did
--
could
the
court
of
appeals
know
that
it's
harem-scarem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
would
that
--
but
would
that
tell
him?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
understand
that
the
subpoena
called
for
the
production
of
the
11th
edition
of
the
encyclopedia
britannica
because
that's
a
particularly
interesting
point.
and
the
court
could
say
it
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
so,
but
that's
so
esoteric
to
claim
but
you
better
prove
it.
but
how
a
court
of
its
own
could
take
judicial
notice,
category
of
documents
that
have
some
relation
to
the
business,
have
no
relation
with
the
complaint,
they
get
the
scriptures
as
far
as
i'm
concerned.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can't
understand
the
position
by
you
that
so
vast
an
amount
of
the
books
and
documents
are
of
concern
or
abstracted
for
a
time
to
cancel
the
coming
of
business.
there
should
be
appropriate
controls,
so
that
your
business
can
go
on
while
the
boards
could
also
be
going
on.
i
can
understand
all
of
that.
i
can
understand
the
rich
of
years
that
--
according
to
the
solicitor
general.
do
you
say
that
cut
it
down
unless
you
make
up
with
the
--
i
can
understand
all
of
those
particulars.
i
cannot
understand
how
from
the
face
of
a
subpoena,
anybody
can
say
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
case,
unless
it's
a
clear
thing,
kind
of
the
foolish
things
that
i
have
put
about
the
11th
edition
of
the
encyclopedia
britannica.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because,
anybody
who
has
had
ever
anything
to
do
with
inquiring
of
this
sort,
and
you
well
know
the
riches
of
relevance
are
not
apparent
on
the
face
of
a
paper.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
can't
answer
your
question.
i
can
answer
a
suggestion.
i
can
agree
with
the
suggestion
that
all
of
the
vouchers
over
a
period,
even
though
they'd
be
dead
vouchers,
the
historic
documents
that
a
business
may
have
demand,
but
turning
to
a
document,
that's
whatever
eight
or
three
months
--
three
years
or
two
years
old.
i
can
understand
all
of
those
accommodations
that
should
be
made
for
the
reasonable
comment
of
a
business
and
the
duty
of
a
governmental
agent,
all
that
i
can
apprehend
and
understand
and
sympathize
with.
i
cannot
understand
any
aspect
determination
of
what
the
categories
are
or
not
relevant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
they
could
--
they
could
photostat
this
body
of
documents
that
you
regard
on
the
case
irrelevant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
the
decision
is
now,
getting
down
to
or
that
they
must
come
to
you
or
that
the
amount
must
come
to
mr.
hermann
or
vice
versa?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
not
saying
it
isn't.
i
just
want
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
it
isn't
and
i've
already
expressed
sympathy
with
appropriate
regulations,
not
to
dislocate
a
business,
and
at
the
same
time,
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
law
for
inquiry.
i'm
just
wondering
if
that's
what
the
case
is
getting
down
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
what
it
should
or
doesn't
on
the
basis
of
the
decision
of
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
these
people
before
us?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
represent
them
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
can
speak
for
them
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor,
would
it
be
asking
too
much
if
at
the
outset
you
would
state
what
--
what
comments
you
have
to
make
in
view
of
the
candid
statement
by
mr.
ginsburg
as
to
--
articulates
concession
that
judge
fee's
ruling,
that
each
individual
document
must
be
justified,
is
not
--
is
not
supported
by
him
and
it
is
rejected
by
him.
what
are
the
effects
of
that
on
your
case?
what
do
you
think
this
court
ought
to
do?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
two
different
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
are
two
--
two
different
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
he
was
very
clear
in
saying,
he
does
not
stand,
he
rejects
the
suggestion
that
the
individual
document
must
be
just
--
the
relevance
of
it
must
be
justified.
i
understood
him
to
say
explicitly,
categories
alone,
their
relevance
must
be
contested.
the
second
part
of
your
--
the
second
question
that
you
have
just
indicated,
namely,
whether
the
fact
that
the
board
asked
for
them
presumptively
makes
them
relevant
and
that
he
does
not
agree
with
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
wouldn't
disagree
with
him
that
he
--
that
you
go
to
court
and
ask
for
enforcement,
to
say
class
one
document.
he
may
interpose
the
events
