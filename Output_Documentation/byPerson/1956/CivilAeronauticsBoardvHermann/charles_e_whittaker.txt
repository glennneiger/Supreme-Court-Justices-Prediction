when
the
subpoenas
were
served
on
you,
asking
for
general
categories
of
information,
and
you
went
it
to
the
judge
and
asked
to
have
the
subpoenas
resisting,
did
you
there
file
any
formal
objection
to
anything
like
a
book
keep
of
records
with
respect
to
mechanics,
wages
and
things
of
that
kind
which
you
claimed
were
not
material
or
relevant
and
asked
him
to
exclude
those?
