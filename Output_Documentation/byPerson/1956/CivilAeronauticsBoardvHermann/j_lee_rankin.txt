mr.
j.
lee
rankin
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
action
which
involves
an
enforcement
proceeding
for
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
issued
by
an
administrative
agency,
the
civil
aeronautics
board,
for
a
group
of
documents
against
the
--
a
number
of
respondents.
the
question
presented
by
the
case
is
whether
or
not
the
agency
has
the
burden
of
satisfying
the
district
court
in
each
case,
whether
each
document
that
is
subpoenaed
is
relevant
and
material,
whether
or
not
it
is
in
possession
of
the
person
to
whom
the
subpoena
is
directed,
and
whether
or
not,
prior
to
the
issuance
of
such
a
subpoena,
it
must
take
the
testimony
in
the
administrative
hearing
and
determine
first
the
existence
and
then
the
location
of
the
documents,
and
then
proceed
to
inspect
the
documents
to
determine
their
relevancy
and
materiality.
the
subpoena
was
issued
in
connection
with
a
complaint,
formal
complaint,
filed
against
the
respondent
which
involves
a
number
of
parties.
the
complaint
charges
that
these
parties
are
engaged
in
violation
of
section
401
(a)
of
the
civil
aeronautics
act.
they
are
licensed.
two
of
them
are
licensed
as
irregular
and
infrequent
carriers.
the
complaint
charges
that
they
are
engaged
in
operating
regular
and
frequent
carriage
of
passengers
and
freight
in
violation
of
the
statute.
also,
that
they
are
engaged
in
using
the
various
response
in
various
activities
in
connection
with
this
operation
which
are
a
violation
of
both
the
economic
regulations
and
the
statute
in
trying
to
accomplish
this
regular
and
frequent
operation
contrary
to
their
license,
and
also,
in
using
and
controlling
various
corporations
and
nominees
so
as
to
be
engaged
in
violation
of
the
regulations
of
the
board
under
the
statute.
the
parties
involved
--
the
principal
parties
are
ida
mae
hermann
and
irving
hermann.
and
they
are
individuals
who
have
a
partnership
known
as
nevada
aero
trades.
that
partnership
has
the
licenses
to
certain
aircraft,
and
those
are
least
to
the
carriers
known
as
great
lakes
airlines
and
currie
transport
corporation.
those
are
the
only
two
carriers
involved.
then,
there
are
12
different
corporations
known
as,
skycoach,
with
various
additions
to
the
name
but
that's
the
principle
attribute
which
are
agencies
engaged
in
various
principal
cities
in
the
united
states
in
obtaining
the
sale
of
tickets
for
the
transfer
and
carriage
of
various
people
from
--
principally,
from
new
york
to
los
angeles
by
way
of
chicago
or
kansas
city
or
philadelphia,
intervening
and
back
the
other
way.
on
pages
36
and
37
of
the
record,
it
is
set
out
in
detail
attached
to
the
complaint,
an
analysis
of
the
various
trips
that
these
carriers
made
of
the
currie
transport
being
bracketed
in
--
in
a
square
bracket
and
the
great
lakes
airlines
in
a
--
in
parenthesis
showing
the
frequency
that
the
board
charges
that
they
operated
in
determining
or
alleging
that
they
are
engaged
--
were
engaged
in
irregular
--
in
frequent
and
regular
transport
instead
of
irregular
and
infrequent
transport.
now,
there
were
quite
a
number
of
documents
that
were
involved
in
the
subpoena.
the
charge
is
that
this
activity,
in
violation
of
the
licenses
covered
a
period
from
december
of
1951
on
through
1953,
about
38
months
involved.
and
it's
claimed
that
--
and
the
board
claims
that
these
two
parties,
the
hermann's,
actually
controlled
skycoach,
all
the
12
corporations
that
were
engaged
in
selling
these
tickets,
as
well
as
the
nevada
trades,
the
partnership
and
a
banking
corporation
that
they
had
which
furnished
the
banking
services
and
another
which
handled
their
--
their
gasoline.
and
these
12
skycoach
corporations,
the
president
was
the
brother
of
mrs.
hermann,
one
of
the
two
partners
and
the
principal
respondents.
and
great
lakes
airlines
agency,
which
served
as
a
banking
--
doing
the
banking
function
for
the
activities
was
head
as
its
vice
president
of
mrs.
hermann's
sister.
so,
there's
that
family
connection
in
regard
--
in
addition
to
all
of
the
other
aspects.
now,
it
was
seemed
clear
that
these
various
documents
that
were
subpoenaed
were
relevant
to
this
controversy
by
reason
of
--
of
the
very
nature
of
the
complaint
and
the
documents
who
requested
it.
the
documents
that
were
included
were
the
financial
records
of
all
of
the
various
respondents.
the
correspondence
and
agreements
between
the
parties,
the
aircraft
that
was
used,
that
in
regard
to
it,
the
licensing
and
the
--
and
leasing
and
any
agreements
of
that
character,
the
personnel
advertising
material,
personal
records,
the
airline
tickets
which
they
are
always
--
they're
supposed
to
be
issued
three
copies,
one
for
the
auditor
and
one
for
the
ticket
agency,
and
one
for
the
carrier,
and
there
is
probably
several
thousand
at
least
documents
that
are
involved
in
the
request.
now,
it's
apparent
that
in
order
to
--
to
show
the
nature
of
the
complaint
and
satisfy
the
proof
required
that
the
agency
had
to
show
that
this
activity
which
was
carried
on
with
--
as
alleged
deliberately
and
willfully
in
violation,
and
also
allege
was
concealed
from
the
board
had
to
be
proved
by
records
which
would
be
largely
in
the
hands
of
the
respondents
themselves.
and
odds
complained
that
the
board
had
it
in
its
possession
the
records
so
that
it
was
not
necessary
for
it
to
subpoena
these
documents.
the
government
concedes
as
to
such
records
as
the
board
actually
had
that
there
would
be
no
necessity
for
such
a
subpoena
to
be
issued,
or
that
the
court
would
be
required
to
enforce
it.
but
the
fact
is
and
i
--
i
have
been
advised
by
the
board
that
they
did
not
have
these
records.
they
had
a
report
in
two
different
forms
of
the
type
of
--
or
the
activities
in
the
carriage
of
passengers
which
were
in
the
nature
of
summaries
and
financial
report
that
was
in
the
nature
of
summaries.
they
also
had
some
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
--
i
don't
know
that
it
is.
i
haven't
--
they
don't
indicate
the
extent
of
their
claim
as
to
what
the
government
has.
but
i
tried
to
find
out
from
the
board
exactly
what
it
had,
and
on
their
statement
to
me,
i
represent
it
to
the
court,
but
that
is
all
that
we
do
have
in
that
nature.
we
also
--
i
also
inquired
about
advertising
materials
and
they
had
some
advertising
materials
of
great
lakes
airlines,
one
of
the
carriers
involved
here,
regular
carriers.
but
they
had
none
as
to
skycoach,
and
they
had
none
as
to
currie
transport,
the
other
carrier.
and
the
board
says
that
over
99%
of
the
advertising
was
handled
under
the
name
of
skycoach,
and
by
it
although
they
claimed
to
be
under
the
direction
of
the
two
hermann's.
so
that
what
little
they
had
was
not
anything
like
this,
involved
in
the
subpoenas.
the
board
--
the
examiner
overruled
the
objections
to
the
subpoena
as
being
oppressive
and
they
--
and
then,
the
board
acted
to
overrule
such
objections,
and
the
district
court
overruled
the
objections.
and
the
district
court
first
ordered
that
there
should
be
at
10
days
postponement
during
which
time
the
party
should
try
to
see
if
the
information
would
not
be
furnished,
and
the
board
proceeded
to
have
its
people
go
to
the
parties
and
examine
their
records
and
try
to
get
the
material
and
they
were
unable
to
obtain
any
satisfactory
examination.
they
did
not
get
correspondents.
they
were
not
able
to
obtain
the
certificate
of
stock
that
a
man
by
the
name
of
smith,
vice
president
of
--
executive
vice
president
of
currie
transport,
had
issued
to
him
and
said
he
was
unable
to
find.
they
were
the
one
who
know
because
they
claimed
that
smith
was
nearly
the
nominee
for
the
hermann's
and
that
they
wanted
to
see
the
endorsement
on
the
stock
to
see
if
the
certificates
--
to
see
if
it
had
been
endorsed
over
in
blank
in
that
situation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
appeared
to
be
the
conventional
thing
to
see
if
they
could
get
together
and
get
it
solved
between
the
parties.
but
the
charges
are
obviously
very
serious
to
these
parties,
and
it
--
if
the
board's
complaint
is
justified,
and
they
had
some
information
that
--
in
regard
to
prior
examination
of
parties
in
connection
with
skycoach
that
supported
the
complaint
before
they
ever
filed
it.
it
is
of
the
nature
that
if
these
records
show
what
the
board
thinks
they
will
show,
they
would
be
damaging
and
--
and
justify
the
board
in
revoking
the
licenses
which
are
very
profitable
and
requiring
a
cease-and-desist
which
they
asked
against
all
of
the
operations,
skycoach
and
the
various
individuals
involved.so
that
they
found
that
they
were
--
the
information
in
the
documents
were
not
furnished
in
this
kind
of
an
experience.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
seemed
like
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
a
first
--
they
first
put
a
burden
upon
the
agency,
and
that's
why
the
government
is
so
disturbed
as
far
as
the
enforcement
ability
and
powers
of
administrative
agency
are
affected
by
this
decision,
and
this
is
not
the
only
one.
there
are
three
others
that
the
same
circuit
judge
has
recently
handed
down
of
the
same
general
purport.
and
he
said,
“first,
they
had
to
go
back
and
--
and
swear
witness
and
determine
what
documents
they
were
--
were,
who
had
the
documents,
and
whether
they
were
relevant
and
material.”
that
is
the
agency
itself.
then
it
--
under
its
inspection
power
which
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
does
except
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
but
it's
in
categories,
very
largely.
i
want
to
make
that
clear
to
the
court.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
doesn't
call
for
each
one
because
we
just
--
the
board
just
didn't
know
every
single
document.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
we
read
it
as
though
he
requires
it
in
all
cases,
because
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the,
“if
required?”
well,
because
he
treats
it
as
though
it's
a
constitutional
right
to
have
every
document
determined
by
the
court
to
be
relevant
and
material
or
you
can't
even
have
them
produce
to
look
at.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
maybe
we're
too
careful
of
it
but
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
then,
after
we've
gotten
through
the
process
of
having
such
a
witness
testify
as
to
the
relevancy
and
materiality
in
the
custody
of
the
documents,
we
were
directed
by
the
court,
that
is
the
agency
itself,
to
use
its
inspection
power
and
make
copies
and
photographs
of
these
various
documents.
and
if
--
at
that
point,
it
was
discovered
that
there
would
be
other
evidence
that
was
withheld
or
necessary.
we
would
have
put
him
up
--
put
on
a
further
witness
or
witnesses
to
determine
what
other
documents
were
necessarily
available.
and
then,
at
that
point,
for
the
first
time,
would
the
administrative
agency
be
permitted
to
issue
subpoena
to
try
to
get
these
documents?
and
then,
after
the
subpoena
was
issued
and
set
out
the
various
documents
desired,
after
we
follow
these
other
three
steps,
the
district
court
was
to
examine
each
one
in
any
enforcement
procedure
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
document
requested
was
relevant
and
material,
document
by
document.
now,
that
is
what
we
think
is
an
impossible
situation.
it's
a
reversal
and
departure
from
all
of
the
principles
under
rule
34,
and
what
the
civil
rules
of
procedure
in
general
practice
which
we
try
to
accomplish.
and
that
--
there,
the
rule
is
whether
or
not
a
document
in
connection
with
discovery
is
probably
material,
and
that
is
all
that's
required.
now,
this
court
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
apparently,
the
purpose
was
to
have
the
entire
--
every
document
there
to
be
ruled
on
step
by
step
by
the
court,
and
have
them
sifted
out
in
that
manner.
now,
we
think
this
is
a
fundamental
departure
from
the
decisions
of
this
court.
we
think
the
law,
prior
to
this,
these
decisions
by
the
--
this
circuit
judge
in
this
circuit,
was
well
settled
by
the
oklahoma
press
case
and
the
endicott
johnson
case,
and
that
the
questions
is
properly,
whether
or
not
the
various
documents
by
categories
are
plainly
irrelevant
and
immaterial,
or
generally
relevant
and
material.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
in
page
39
is
a
detail
of
the
subpoenas.
on
--
in
the
appendix
of
the
respondent's
brief,
they
have
set
out
a
summary
of
the
various
items
in
general
summarization,
which
we
do
not
--
do
not
thoroughly
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
it's
too
full.
i
think
that
he
treats
it
as
though
we're
asking
for
far
too
much.
and
the
board
asked
for
so
much
because
the
complaint
involves
a
violation
during
this
entire
period,
and
they're
asking
for
the
various
transactions
that
occurred
during
the
period.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
--
it
isn't
--
we
--
we
might
be
urging
before
the
lower
court.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
we
recognized
that
the
court
must
have
control
under
the
discretion
of
--
of
the
range
of
the
demands,
and
whether
they
are
unreasonable.
the
court
did
try
to
take
that
into
account
in
--
a
regard
here
though,
by
saying
that
the
documents
could
be
furnished
over
a
period
of
time,
so
they
wouldn't
be
taking
these
books
and
records
all
away
from
the
respondents,
but
could
take
certain
parts
of
them.
and
then,
examine
those
and
then
return
others
so
that
it
would
be
a
staggered
examination.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
don't
think
so.
we
recognize
that
the
--
the
system
has
a
right
in
this
area.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
and
we
--
we
contend
that
it's
very
destructive
of
this
whole
area
of
action
to
try
to
protect
the
public
interest
as
far
as
the
administrative
agencies
of
the
government
are
concerned
and
is
--
it
reduces
materially
what
could
be
accomplished
by
an
ordinary
citizen
in
just
his
own
personal
litigation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
he
tried
to
that
deliberately
so
that
it
wouldn't
appear
with
the
operation
of
business.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
one
thing
as
to
these
various
ticket
coupons
and
the
necessity
for
them.
you
see,
in
order
to
--
what
happened
according
to
the
contention
of
the
board
in
this
activity
was
that
great
lakes
airlines
was
suppose
to
have
tickets
issued
for
news
on
great
lakes
airlines
and
nothing
else.
and
it's
the
contention
of
the
board
that
skycoach
would
issue
tickets
and
would
take
those
tickets
and
take
passengers
on
great
lakes
airlines
and
currie
transport
interchangeably
so
as
to
make
this
in
the
nature
of
a
regular
airlines
operation.
and
by
tracing
through
the
activities,
the
ledger
account
that's
set
out
in
the
record
shows
that
on
the
ledger,
they
merely
had
the
item
of
almost
a
$1,000,000
of
income
from
skycoach
or
agency.
that's
all
the
ledger
showed
us
that
they
furnishes.
now,
you
can't
trace
through
there
anything
like
that,
what
the
activity
was.
but
if
you'll
take
the
coupon
who
has
have
it
issued
to
john
jones,
by
skycoach,
for
carriage
on
either
currie
transport
or
great
lakes
airlines
and
then
find
that
that
man
was
on
the
document
for
the
particular
transport
of
currie
when
he
was
listed
for
great
lakes
airline,
you
can
show
just
what
was
happening
all
the
way
through
and
who
has
had
the
power
to
control
the
activity
and
decide
that
this
whole
thing
would
flow
together
just
as
like
one
--
one
of
the
number
of
cogs
in
an
entire
operation
under
the
control
of
the
hermann's
as
contended
for
by
the
board.
and
it's
only
by
their
records
in
their
possession
that
those
things
can
be
demonstrated
unless
you
try
to
go
out
and
find
all
passengers
all
over
the
united
states
which
would
be
a
place
of
an
unreasonable
burden
upon
an
administrative
agency.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
--
the
difficulty
i
have
with
that
is
whether
he's
still
urging
that
the
district
court
has
to
examine
as
to
the
various
documents
individually
as
to
relevancy
or
materiality
or
whether
he
concedes
that
the
general
categories,
if
they're
generally
found
to
be
irrelevant.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
under
the
complaint
and
the
nature
of
these
documents,
it
can
be
fairly
assumed
that
they're
relevant
on
the
face
of
it
unless
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
unless
they
come
forth.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
would
not
want
to
urge
that
the
fact
the
board
asked
for
them
alone,
but
in
the
context
of
their
complaint.
and
the
nature
of
the
documents,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
a
showing
of
relevancy
and
materiality
under
the
motions
of
the
court
that
unless
there
is
some
showing
that
this
particular
document,
affirmatively
made
by
the
respondents,
could
not
possibly
contribute
anything
to
this
lawsuit.
that
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
not
at
all.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
would
not.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
my
position
on
behalf
of
the
government
is
that
it's
not
correct.
the
government
does
not
ask
that
it
be
brought
to
them
as
distinguished
from
going
to
their
records.
the
only
difficulty
is
we
tried
the
first
one.
and
what
do
we
get?
we
found
that
they
produced
no
tickets,
not
a
single
one
out
of
90,000.
they
produced
no
advertising
material
which
was
requested.
they
didn't
produce
the
stock
certificate.
they
didn't
produce
the
minutes
of
the
pilots'
meeting
that
was
specifically
requested.
they
produced
no
records
of
the
great
lakes
airlines
agency,
and
they
produced
no
correspondence.
we
found
correspondence
in
the
hands
of
some
of
the
skycoach
agencies
that
couldn't
possibly
but
have
some
kind
of
a
counterpart
in
these
other
corporations.
but
we
go
out
there
and
we
spend
10
days
at
the
court's
suggestion
which
is
entirely
reasonable
to
try
to
solve
this
by
going
out
and
inspect
it.
and
what
do
we
find?
we
just
played
tag
with
it.
the
--
some
of
the
records
are
in
attorneys
keatinge
and
so
forth
hands,
others
in
their
advertising
agent's
hands,
and
others
in
the
hands
of
their
accountants.
and
then,
we
can't
find
--
those
aren't
produced.
and
finally,
the
court
got
sick
of
it
too.
we
--
we
don't
insist
on
behalf
of
the
government
that
you
--
they've
got
to
bring
them
to
the
post
office
building
and
the
court
was
trying
to
provide
a
reasonable
time
by
staggering
the
production
and
try
to
have
the
inspection,
but
nothing
worked,
and
i
couldn't
see
why
it
wouldn't.
this
is
a
very
serious
situation
for
these
people.
they've
got
one
cease-and-desist
order
against
the
great
lakes
airlines
for
operating
as
an
irregular
carrier.
and
now,
this
is
a
question
of
whether
a
whole
license
be
revoked.
now,
they
don't
have
any
right
to
have
any
ownership
of
any
kind
in
nevada
aero
trades,
or
any
of
these
skycoach
agencies,
or
any
of
these
other
operations
if
they're
connected
with
some
other
independent
airlines.
and
currie
is
what
they
--
they
claim
they're
independent
of
currie.
although,
the
board
claims
that
they
just
operate
altogether
measure
like
that.
now,
if
we
can
show
by
the
tickets
that
after
they
got
the
cease-and-desist
back
there,
against
one
agency,
they
proceed
to
operate
to
currie
and
operate
them
all
together,
and
show
how
they
--
they
transferred
employees
back
and
forth.
they
paid
them
out
of
this
pocket
and
out
of
that
pocket,
and
how
everything
is
operated
altogether,
like
he's
charged
in
the
complaint
and
that
they
took
control
of
these
various
companies
when
in
--
without
any
approval
of
cab
in
violation
of
the
statute.
then,
no
court
would
hesitate
if
the
board
finds
that
their
licenses
should
be
revoked
in
a
cease-and-desist
ordered
against
them,
which
is
a
very
serious
thing,
because
they're
making
lot
of
money
of
this
operation.
no
court
would
hold
that
should
not
be
sustained.
but
if
we
have
it
for
one
week
or
two
weeks
or
three
weeks
or
some
month,
and
the
court
might
say,
“well,
what
about
the
rest?
did
they
quit
today?”
so,
i
think,
on
the
face
of
it,
that
we're
entitled
--
administrative
agencies,
i
urge
you,
are
entitled
to
go
into
these
things
on
the
presumption
within
reasonable
limits
that
they're
trying
to
protect
the
public
interest.
and
when
you
charge
like
they
have
that
here's
the
whole
scheme
of
a
number
of
cards
working
together,
that
these
people
who
put
together
after
they
got
one
cease-and-desist
already,
to
operate
together
and
defeat
of
the
whole
purpose
of
this
act
of
congress,
it's
time
that
it'd
be
looked
at
with
the
idea
of
giving
the
board
a
chance
to
prove
the
things
necessary
to
establish
the
facts
so
that
we
won't
have
any
trouble
of
the
facts,
and
then
we
can
apply
the
law
to
those
facts.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
the
way
we
read
it.
thank
you.
