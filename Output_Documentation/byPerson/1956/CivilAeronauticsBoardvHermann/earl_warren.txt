mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
general,
am
i
--
am
i
correct
to
--
on
the
question
of
time
that
the
district
court
did
limit
this
to
two
months
at
a
time,
did
it
not,
so
that
--
so
that
there
would
not
be
too
many
documents
taken
away
from
their
place
of
business
in
one
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
two
months
at
a
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ginsburg.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
it
your
position
that
the
court
must
look
at
those
documents
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
determine
materiality?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
are
they
to
determine
materiality?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
they
haven't
done
it
already?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
solicitor
general
pointed
out
one
--
one
thing
in
his
argument
that
might
carry
you
rather
deeply
into
the
books
of
the
subsidiaries.
he
said
that
the
books
of
the
--
the
principle
corporations,
as
i
understood
him,
showed
what
their
revenues
were
plus
blank
dollars
from
their
--
from
their
agency.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
it
doesn't
say
who
they
were,
how
they
were,
what
the
nature
of
the
transaction
was,
whether
it
was
--
whether
those
transactions
were
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
on
a
continuous
service
or
--
or
whatever
it
might
be.
now,
that
of
course
would
--
would
carry
--
might
carry
them
into
a
great
many
avenues
of
the
business,
both
of
the
main
corporation
and
the
subsidiaries,
but
how
is
the
judge
going
to
have
to
do
that
unless
it
fairly
appears
to
him
that
--
that
those
scenes
aren't
necessary
in
order
to
find
out
what
the
operation
has
been
between
all
these
people.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
just
give
me
the
main
one.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
mean,
you
--
you
complied
with
that
part
of
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
do
you
mean,
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
doesn't
approve
that
they
don't
need
them
and
that
doesn't
prove
anything
about
the
materiality
of
it,
seems
to
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
the
commission
and
the
court
bound
by
that
affidavit?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
solicitor
general
as
i
understood
him
pointed
out
that
that
those
things
were
--
were
necessary
in
order
perhaps
to
be
able
to
show
that
this
was
more
or
less
one
operation.
and
was
that
--
all
these
various
activities
were
--
were
designed
to
accomplish
one
such
purpose.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
all
the
way
stretches
--
this
kept
in
the
books
might
have
very
--
very
important
bearing
on
it.
i
don't
say
it
does,
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
i
--
i
just
don't
know.
and
is
there
anything
in
the
record
here
that
would
--
would
enable
us
to
establish
in
our
own
minds
that
those
things
could
not
have
had
any
such
bearing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
should
we
just
take
your
assumption
or
should
we
take
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
shouldn't
we
give
some
consideration
to
the
--
the
knowledge
of
the
--
of
the
board
as
to
commission,
as
to
its
jurisdiction,
and
his
needs,
and
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
as
to
the
relevancy
of
those
matters?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
part
of
that
has
he
not
done?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
finding
did
not
--
those
are
irrelevant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ginsburg,
there
are
some
individuals
also
who
were
defendants,
did
they
all
offer
to
do
the
same
thing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
have
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
wouldn't
they
interplay
between
their
records
and
--
and
the
company,
be
rather
essential
in
working
out
this
problem?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
could
the
government
--
how
could
the
government
know
then
if
that
one
defendant
permitted
these
books
to
be
seen
and
the
other
one
wouldn't?
how
--
how
could
they
--
how
could
they
do
this
work
that
you
think
would
be
so
reasonable
and
working
out
what
they
actually
need
in
the
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
general,
what
--
what
is
your
position
in
regard
to
the
statement
of
mr.
ginsburg
that
this
gets
down
practically
to
the
--
the
proposition
as
to
whether
the
record
should
come
to
you
or
you
should
go
to
the
records?
