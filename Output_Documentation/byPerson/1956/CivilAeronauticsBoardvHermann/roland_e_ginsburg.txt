mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
constrained
to
correct
the
solicitor
general
on
the
point
the
chief
justice
just
inquired
about.
the
documents
who
called
for
were
not
limited
to
two
months
or
to
any
period.
on
page
145
of
the
record,
the
final
order
of
the
district
court
appears.
there
were
various
subpoenas
issued
in
this
proceeding.
there
were
10
subpoenas,
all
of
which
are
the
subject
to
this
appeal.
and
each
subpoena,
well,
the
period
of
them
ranges
from
34
to
38
months.
and
when
each
witness
was
called
upon,
and
the
dates
were
staggered,
he
was
to
produce
all
of
the
documents
for
the
34
or
38-month
period
as
the
case
may
be.it
was
not
broken
up
two
months
at
a
time.
i
just
wanted
to
set
the
record
straight
on
that
matter,
and
it
appears
on
page
145
of
the
record.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
yes,
your
honor.
if
i
may
preface
my
remark
with
one
statement,
it
is
our
position
that
the
district
court
did
not
decide
this
case,
did
not
decide
the
legal
issues
in
this
case.
and
it
is
our
--
our
view
as
the
court
of
appeals
simply
required
the
district
court
to
decide
the
case,
to
decide
the
legal
issues
in
the
case.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
yes,
yes
sir.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
yes,
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
the
--
the
discussion
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
with
regard
to
the
enforcement
--
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
well,
the
district
court
made
a
decision,
your
honor,
but
if
the
district
court
did
not
decide
what
the
court
of
appeals
conceive
to
be
the
legal
issues
in
the
case,
and
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
there's
a
great
deal
of
discussion
at
the
inception
of
the
decision
as
to
how
an
administrative
subpoena
case,
enforcement
case,
should
be
decided.
and
the
court
goes
into
a
great
deal
of
discussion
as
to
how
it
conceives
this
should
be
done.
it
is
our
position
and
this
is
all
dictum.
because
at
page
173
of
the
record,
the
court
says,
makes
a
reference
to
the
inspection
in
the
district
court.
and
then
it
says,
“since
the
court
proceeded
along
the
proper
lines
in
the
first
instance,
all
difficulties
will
now
be
resolved
by
the
court
passing
upon
designated
judicial
issues,
and
those
issues
are
essentially
four.
the
first
one
is
possession
and
control
by
the
person
of
the
documents,
by
the
person
subpoenaed.”
we
will
acknowledge
and
we
did
acknowledge
in
this
case,
if
the
person
subpoenaed
had
possession
and
control
of
the
documents
with
one
exception
which
i'll
come
to.
accordingly,
this
is
dictum.
if
we
don't
assert
this
defense
and
the
court
decides
it,
i
believe
that
to
be
dictum
and
accordingly,
i
don't
think
it's
controlling.
the
other
matter
--
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
yes
we
would,
your
honor,
yes
we
would.
and
i
think
what
was
troubling
the
court
--
on
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
we
feel
that
on
remand,
the
district
court
should
decide
the
issues
in
this
case,
the
legal
issues
that
we
raised
and
they
are
relevance
and
materiality
of
the
documents
called
for,
burdensomeness
or
oppressiveness
of
the
demand
and
whether
or
not
the
rights
of
privacy
of
individuals
have
been
invaded
by
reason
of
the
demand
for
personal
income
tax
returns.
we
asserted,
sir,
no
--
no
objection
on
the
issue
of
possession
or
control.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
that
is
essentially
what
happened.
however,
i
would
like
to
go
under
a
little
detail
on
that
if
i
may,
mr.
justice,
and
that
is,
during
the
course
of
this
inspection,
i
wanted
to
point
out
that
the
outset
of
this
argument
how
tremendously
broad
these
subpoenas
are
and
how
many
irrelevant,
obviously
irrelevant
documents
are
called
for
and
i
hope
i'll
have
an
opportunity
to
do
that.
now,
the
inspection
was
ordered
by
the
district
court
because
it
couldn't
--
it
was
a
--
it's
a
very
difficult
case
to
decide.
obviously,
the
board
is
entitled
to
some
of
these
documents.
and
just
as
obviously,
the
--
the
board
is
asked
for
too
many
documents,
many
of
which
have
no
relation
to
the
case.
accordingly,
the
district
court
did
a
very
reasonable
thing
and
ordered
an
inspection,
not
just
to
see
if
the
thing
would
--
could
be
worked
out,
to
see
if
the
board
could
go
out
and
inspect
all
of
the
documents.
and
thereby,
limit
the
subpoenas
to
the
documents
they
needed,
instead
of
requiring
these
respondents
to
assume
this
tremendous
burden
of
producing
unnecessary
documents.
we've
alleged
and
i
think
shown
that
we
--
that
the
respondents
couldn't
have
conducted
their
business
at
that
time,
their
businesses,
without
these
documents.
and
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
found
there
were
truck
loads
of
records,
comprehensive
and
practically
every
book
paper
or
record
over
concerning
the
respondent
company,
that's
almost
a
quote.
now,
that
was
the
way
the
issue
was
faced
by
the
district
court.
and
on
remand,
we
feel
the
district
court
should
decide
whether
or
not
the
documents
are
material,
because
the
district
court
didn't
decide
that.
the
district
court
said,
after
laying
the
subpoenas
along
side
the
charges
of
the
complaint,
the
district
court
can't
say
whether
or
not
--
can't
say
that
any
of
the
documents
are
immaterial
or
irrelevant
without
examining
the
documents
themselves
which
this
court
has
not
called
upon
to
do
at
this
time.
the
district
court
did
not
decide
that
a
single
document
was
relevant
or
material.
and
that
we
submit
the
district
court
did
not
even
decide
that
--
that
any
of
them
were
irrelevant
or
immaterial,
that
they
were
not
irrelevant
and
not
immaterial.
it
excuses
double
negative
--
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
no,
your
honor.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
that
is
not
our
position.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
well,
your
honor,
if
i
--
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
they
haven't
done
it.
if
i
may
make
a
reference
to
--
to
one
demand
and
contained
and
it's
common
to
all
of
the
subpoenas
served
upon
all
of
the
corporate
and
partnership
respondents.
that
is
the
demand
for
all
general
ledgers,
all
subsidiary
ledgers,
all
supporting
documents
of
the
books
to
the
entries
in
these
ledgers,
and
all
vouchers,
and
all
invoices
and
journals.
now,
here,
we
have
some
busy
companies.
they
have
a
lot
paper
work.
they
buy
just
like
any
company.
there's
a
lot
of
routine
purchases
and
sales.
they
buy
a
typewriter.
they
buy
a
paper.
they
buy
supplies.
they
bag
parts
for
their
maintenance
division.
i
don't
know
if
this
court
is
aware
that
every
voucher
and
invoice
in
connection
with
everyone
of
these
myriad
purchases
has
to
be
produced.
now,
obviously,
the
vast
overwhelming
majority
of
these
documents
have
no
relation
to
the
issues
in
this
case.
this
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
saw.
they
could
see
that
most
of
them
were
just
routine
transact
--
most
of
the
documents
related
to
routine
transactions
which
the
board
wasn't
even
interested
in.
and
during
the
course
of
this
inspection,
i
wanted
to
get
--
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
i
claim
that
the
board
--
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
--
really
isn't
interested
in
them.
they've
asked
for
them.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
i
will
have
to
--
i'm
assuming
it,
your
honor.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
if
your
honor
please,
what
interest
would
the
court
--
would
the
board
have
in
documents
relating
to
the
purchase
of
supplies
to
the
purchase
of
an
article
for
a
--
a
plane
part
--
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
--
or
insurances?
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
i
don't
know,
your
honor,
but
it
seems
--
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
--
clear
to
me
that
there's
no
--
that
it
has
no
relevance
to
the
issues
in
this
case,
whatsoever.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
yes.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
well,
if
your
honor
please,
there's
more
than
one
answer
to
this
question.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
well,
your
honor,
the
--
the
papers
of
the
so-called
subsidiaries,
all
the
books,
papers,
records
and
documents
were
subpoenaed
also
in
this
proceeding.
however,
they
are
not
part
of
this
appeal.
they're
nevertheless
had
been
subpoenaed.
the
similar
subpoena
has
been
issued
to
all
of
the
ticket
agencies.
the
second
point
in
mrs.
hermann's
affidavit,
she
states
that
all
of
these
record
--
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
no
your
honor.
that
case
--
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
there
was
another
enforcement
case.
well,
these
other
subpoenas
were
not
made
a
part
of
this
subpoena
enforcement
case.
they
were
made
a
part
of
a
separate
subpoena
enforcement
case,
and
we
entered
in
to
a
stipulation
with
the
u.s.
attorney
in
los
angeles
to
the
effect
that
we
would
be
governed
with
respect
to
those
subpoenas
by
the
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
i
--
i
thought
your
honor
was
questioning
how
they
were
going
to
obtain
this
information
and
that
is
the
source
from
which
they
could
obtain
the
books
of
the
--
of
the
ticket
agencies.
another
answer
to
--
to
your
question
is
that
in
mrs.
hermann's
affidavit,
she
alleges
that
all
of
the
information
they
need
or
all
of
the
--
all
of
the
information
they
--
they
are
now
claiming
that
they
couldn't
find
from
the
books
they
examined
were
available
in
the
form
of
supporting
documents
which
they
had.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
which
were
available
for
inspection
by
which
no
request
was
made
for.
that's
in
--
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
no,
your
honor,
but
it's
not
contradicted.
and
that
there
might
be
some
conflict
--
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
conflict.
mrs.
hermann
said
that
the
investigators
did
not
ask
for
these
documents,
but
such
documents
were
available
and
they
would
have
been
glad
to
make
them
available.
my
point
here
is
that
in
my
opinion,
many
of
the
documents
called
for
have
no
bearing
upon
the
case.
i'll
take
another
specific
example
if
i
may.
the
subpoenas
directed
to
the
corporate
and
partnership
respondents
called
for
all
personnel
and
payroll
records
for
a
period
of
38
months
and
all
vouchers.
now,
great
lakes
airlines
has
an
extensive
maintenance
division.
it's
established
in
this
record.
they
have
many
mechanics
and
i've
seen
out
they're
climbing
around
those
airplanes.
they
pay
this
man
every
week.
every
one
of
those
vouchers
has
to
be
produced.
we
don't
see
any
--
any
conceivable
relevance.
i
can't
assume
that
for
the
board,
but
we
don't
believe
that
they
are
relevant.
and
we
don't
believe
that
the
district
court
passed
upon
this
--
this
type
of
issue.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
oh,
i
don't
believe
that
the
--the
vouchers
used
in
connection
with
paying
a
mechanic
has
any
bearing
on
whether
or
not
these
companies
are
one
and
the
same.
we
of
course
disputed
the
--
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
--
we've
denied
that
they
are.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
i
understand.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
well,
i
can't
conceive
of
any
relationship
between
them.
that's
all
i
can
say
that
we
should
--
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
well,
i
think
the
court
should
consider
in
itself
in
relation
to
the
issues
in
the
case.
i
don't
think
it
should
accept
my
assumption.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
well,
i
don't
think
the
district
court
passed
on
these
issues.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
and
--
and
that
is
the
--
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
your
honor,
we
did
in
this
way.
we
filed
objections
and
a
return
to
the
order
tho
show
cause
in
which
we
stated
that
many
of
the
documents
were
immaterial
and
irrelevant.
and
in
an
argument
before
the
court,
we
attempted
to
point
out
the
items,
which
we
felt
were
not
relevant.
and
we
also
attempted
to
show
the
court
the
affect
of
requiring
these
respondents
to
produce
the
documents
that
there
--
the
man
was
for
hundreds
of
--
literally,
hundreds
of
thousands
of
documents,
many
of
which
were
in
our
opinion,
needed.
and
this
is
what
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
us.
the
court
of
appeals
founded
the
district
court
haven't
in
effect
decided
the
case.
i
perhaps
could
try
one
more
item
here,
to
try
to
impress
the
court
with
the
fact
that
the
board
is
asked
for
too
many
documents
in
connection
with
these
ticket
coupons
that
the
solicitor
general
has
referred
to.
we
have
established
here
that
there
is
a
demand
for
no
less
than
90,000
ticket
coupons
to
prove
these
ticketing
practices
and
in
the
so-called
relationship
between
the
parties.
we
don't
believe
that
90,000
ticket
coupons
are
necessary.
i
can't,
again,
assume
this
for
the
board.
the
board
after
these
many
documents,
we
came
in
and
said,
this
--
this
amount
to
90,000
ticket
coupons.
i
think
there
was
an
issue
for
the
court
to
decide
whether
or
not
they
needed
90,000
ticket
coupons,
conceding
of
course
that
the
boards
--
the
board
has
an
argument
hereto.
they
probably
need
some
of
them,
undoubtedly
they
do.
but
do
you
need
90,000
coupons
to
prove
a
violation
or
even
a
continuing
violation?
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
well,
your
honors,
your
honor,
i
believe,
first
of
all,
that
the
requirement
with
respect
to
each
document,
the
materiality
and
relevancy
of
each
document
should
be
dropped.
i
don't
think
the
board
should
be
required
to
prove
the
relevancy
and
materiality
of
each
single
document.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
i
think
he
does,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
and
i
don't
think
that
the
board
should
have
to.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
pardon?
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
that
is.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
i
don't
think
that
--
i
think
that's
an
unreasonable
burden.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
and
we
concede
that
truly.
however,
i
think
that
they
should
prove
the
relevance
of
all
the
documents
that
are
subpoenaed,
not
piece
by
piece,
but
by
groups,
but
by
categories.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
and,
perhaps
they
are.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
respondents.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
i
think
he
should
do
that,
i
don't
think
he
has
done
it.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
i
don't
think
he
is
determined
that
the
documents
are
relevant
and
material.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
i
don't
believe
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
it
does
not
sir.
it
says,
“i
cannot
say
whether
or
not
any
of
the
documents
are
immaterial
or
irrelevant.”
he
doesn't
even
say
--
he
doesn't
say
that
they
are
relevant.
he
said,
“i
can't
say
whether
they're
irrelevant.”
that's
what
the
court
--
district
court
has
said,
and
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
--
in
that
regard,
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
district
court
didn't
decide
the
legal
issues.
they
never
--
the
district
court
never
talked
about
the
burden
imposed
upon
the
respondents
which
was
very
considerable.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
that
--
i
don't
think
we
have
to
assume
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
we
can
turn
to
the
previous
page
143
and
see
what
the
court
said
about
it.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
that's
the
--
that's
the
language
that
i've
been
reading.
it's
the
first
paragraph
on
page
143.
he
said,
“i
can't
say.
therefore,
i'm
going
to
--
that
i'm
going
to
enforce
the
subpoenas.”
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
that's
discharging
judicial
power.
i
think
that
this
is
a
judicial
decision
to
make.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
i
hate
to
be
--
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
they're
calling
for
a
lot
of
documents
that
don't
have
any
relation
to
the
case,
that's
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
if
they
really
thought
about
it,
i
don't
think
they
would.
in
the
course
of
this
examination,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
they
couldn't
even
scratch
the
surface
to
six
representatives
out
there
for
six
or
seven
days.
there
were
so
many
thousands
of
documents.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
we
could
--
we
could
argue
that
--
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
--
and
i
think
we
should
be
--
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
that
is
the
way
we
brought
it
up.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
we
--
i
believe
we
did
formally
point
them,
out
your
honor.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
it
did
not
rule.
instead
of
that,
the
court
said,
“i
can't
conclude
that
--
and
at
this
time,
that
any
are
immaterial
or
irrelevant
set
--
”
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
what
the
court
said
your
honor
was,
“bring
them
all
in
here.
if
you
could
bring
them
in
here
then
i
might
be
able
to
decide,
but
i
can't
decide
now.
i
can't
say
they
are
immaterial
or
irrelevant.”
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
well,
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
found
here,
your
honor.
i
think
--
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
because
the
court
of
appeals
examined
the
subpoenas
carefully.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
i
think
it's
apparent
from
the
face
of
the
subpoenas.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
and
we
have
the
issues
in
them.
they
have
administered
of
complaint
and
they
compare
the
two,
i
think
it's
apparent.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
it
is.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
effect,
“you've
asked
for
all
the
documents
that
these
companies
have.”
all
the
documents
are
not
necessary
in
this
proceeding.
i
should
point
this
out.
both
courts
that
looked
to
this
case
felt
immediately,
that
there
should
be
an
inspection.
an
inspection
is
what
this
case
calls
for,
because
the
categories
are
so
broad
and
call
for
so
many
documents
--
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
an
inspection
of
these
very
same
documents
with
the
opportunity
to
photograph
the
documents,
to
copy
the
documents,
to
know
which
documents
are
necessary.
i
say
this
is
not
efficient
administration
to
call
for
all
documents.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
well
--
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
may
i
address
the
question
to
you,
mr.
justice?
i
--
i
wonder
if
--
when
all
of
the
vouchers
and
invoices
of
a
busy
company
are
called
for,
it
cannot
be
assumed
that
every
one
of
them
is
relevant
and
material
to
define
issues
in
an
administrative
enforcement
case.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
i
believe
my
time
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
your
honor,
we
did
estimate
the
number
of
documents
in
various
categories.
in
the
category
that
are
--
i
have
been
discussing
with
mr.
justice
frankfurter
we
estimated
200,000
documents.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
in
connection
with
the
tickets,
there
were
90,000.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
90,000
tickets
--
ticket
coupons.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
25,000
cancelled
checks.
that
is
315,000
so
far.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
and
with
respect
to
the
remainder,
we
did
not
estimate
the
calls
for
a
number.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
that
was
what
--
that
was
the
statement
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
did
--
we
did
show
this
your
honor
in
--
that
we
showed
the
number
of
employees.
we
showed
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
paperwork
in
connection
with
operations
of
these
airlines
and
a
great
deal
of
documentation,
we
showed
both.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
yes
sir.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
yes,
your
honor,
it
was.
the
first
hearing
--
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
that's
right.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
at
the
first
hearing
your
honor,
judge
hall,
after
reading
the
complaint
and
examining
the
subpoenas,
his
first
action
was
to
say,
“as
each
counsel
of
the
state
of
--
its
respective
position.”
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
yes,
we
--
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
well,
the
court
initially.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
no
we
did
not,
neither
--
neither
side
objected
to
that.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
neither
side
objected.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
never,
and
we
don't
object
to
it.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
well,
what
happened
there
your
honor
was
there
was
an
inspection
which
lasted
about
seven
days.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
it
was
made
at
the
facilities
of
the
respondents
in
burbank,
california.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
pardon?
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
that's
right
your
honor,
and
their
facilities.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
no,
your
honor.
the
first
hearing,
i
think
it
was
around
april
7th
or
6th,
and
the
inspection
continued
from
april
7
to
april
15,
1955.
at
the
conclusion,
the
--
the
court
asked
the
government,
“how
long
would
it
take
to
inspect
these
documents?”
and
they
said,
“we
can
be
done
by
such
--
by
the
18th
of
april.”
in
the
18th,
the
government
came
in
with
affidavits
without
notice
to
us
which
asserted
that
we
have
not
permitted
a
full
inspection,
that
they
have
not
been
able
to
see
some
documents.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
we
subsequently
denied
it.
and
we
convict
--
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
we
--
we
didn't
have
a
trial
on
it,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
we
--
we
submitted
the
affidavits
and
we
apparently
convinced
the
district
court
that
we
had
complied
with
it,
because
he
permitted
us
to
reargue
the
case
on
the
legal
issues.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
your
honor,
we
were
at
all
times
willing
to
continue
an
inspection,
and
we
remained
--
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
at
all
times.we
have
never
objected
to
it.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
that's
right.
they
are
at
liberty
to
copy
photograph
or
photograph
the
document.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
i
don't
believe
--
i
don't
know
that
the
government
was
willing.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
to
the
federal
building
in
los
angeles
where
the
hearing
was
conducted,
to
downtown
los
angeles.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
no.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
yes.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
that
really
--
it
gets
almost
onto
that
point.
we
are
satisfied
if
they
come
to
our
facilities
and
examine
the
documents
and
offer
an
evidence,
make
photographs
and
copies
and
offer
an
evidence
such
of
those
documents
as
they
wish.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
might
add
that
we
are
required
too
under
section
487
(e)
of
the
civil
aeronautics
act.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
i
would
--
i
would
think
it's
about
15
miles,
your
honor,
approximately
15
miles.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
if
they
wish
to.
as
long
as
it
--
we're
not
required
to
track
them
all
down
to
the
federal
building.
we
have
no
objection
because
we
know
or
we
feel
we
know
that
they
don't
want
them.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
well,
i
must
admit
it
does.
however,
that's
a
serious
problem
with
respect
to
these
people.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
these
were
current
documents
at
the
time
that
we
needed.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
that
is
what
it
should
get
down
to,
your
honor,
in
my
opinion.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
as
far
as
the
respondents
are
concerned,
it's
down
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
they
haven't,
your
honor.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
they
have
not.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
they
have
not.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
to
the
board.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
i
can
only
say
this,
your
honor,
that
these
--
i
think
you're
referring
to
the
advertising
agency
in
the
two
accounting
firms.
i
think
that
they
--
if
the
respondent,
the
--
the
principle
respondents
here,
the
airlines
were
to
indicate
to
them
that
they
have
no
objection
to
the
inspection
of
these
documents
that
they
would
permit
it.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
yes,
your
honor,
they
are
the
respondents.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
yes
i
do.
mr.
roland
e.
ginsburg
i
--
i've
never
spoken
to
these
individuals
about
the
inspection.
i
can't
speak
for
the
airline
companies.
i
can
name
the
companies.
i
can
speak
for
great
lakes
airlines,
currie
transport,
air
international,
nevada
aero
trades,
great
lakes
agency,
we
will
permit
an
inspection.
as
to
the
independent
auditors
and
advertising
agencies,
i've
never
spoken
to
them
on
the
subject,
and
i
couldn't
agree.
i
would
be
glad
to
contact
them
in
anyway
i
could
to
make
the
--the
results
of
that
that
my
questioning
available
to
the
court.
thank
you.
