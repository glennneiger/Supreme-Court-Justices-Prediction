what
do
you
mean
by
inspection?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
time
is
not
--
did
you
offer
to
prove
or
once
they're
approved
to
come
in,
in
truckloads
of
these
papers
that
were
--
you
said
truckload,
was
there
any
proof
of
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
documents
in
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they're
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
else?
justice
hugo
l.
black
315,000.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
said
--
you
said
something
about
truckloads.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
something
about
inspection,
which
interested
me.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
your
--
was
your
hearing
then
a
kind
of
an
informal
nature
before
judge
hall?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
something
what
could
be
done
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
what's
the
best
way
to
ask
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
--
did
you
ever
suggest
or
did
the
government
suggest,
rather
than
bring
all
those
documents
of
the
truck,
that
they
might
be
made
available
for
them
to
look
at
in
your
office?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
made
that
suggestion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
--
did
you
object
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
neither
side
objected?
justice
hugo
l.
black
neither
side
objected?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
ever
objected
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
--
if
the
government
didn't
object,
what
--
what
reason,
why
was
that
not
carried
out
for
us
to
avoid
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
made
the
inspection
and
where?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
made
it
the
company's
office.
justice
hugo
l.
black
company's
office?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
did
you
stop
it
or
did
anybody
stop
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
deny
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
have
a
trial
--
did
you
have
a
trial
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
you
--
were
you
afforded
an
opportunity
to
try
out
that
issue?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
did
the
--
with
that
situation
that
way
then,
why
did
the
arraignment
which
seems
to
me
frequently
would
be
much
better
than
a
lawsuit
to
go
in
and
all
the
way
up
here?
why
did
not
the
arrangement
proceed
as
it
had
begun?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
that
with
you
in
all
times.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
the
government
to
send
its
representatives
and
to
see,
and
then
it
could
show
relevancy,
is
that
your
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
if
you
had
that
attitude,
i
don't
quite
understand
why
that
matter
went
on
to
this
point
if
the
government
was
willing
to
do
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
indication
that
the
government
couldn't
do
that
as
easily
as
it
could
to
have
them
brought
up
to
some
--
what
office
were
they
to
be
brought
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
did
they
--
they
were
not
to
be
taken
to
their
office?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
they
happen
to
have
their
representatives
at
the
federal
building
to
investigate
the
paper?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
is
a
question
then
so
far
as
that's
concerned
whether
they
are
--
inspectors
would
have
to
work
at
your
office
or
work
at
the
federal
building?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
indicate
your
willingness
to
let
them
photostat
anything
you
have?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
far
is
it
from
your
office
to
the
federal
building?
