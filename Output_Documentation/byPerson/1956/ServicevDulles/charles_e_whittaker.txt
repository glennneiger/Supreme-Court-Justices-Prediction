and
if
that
reason
is
an
invalid
reason.
but,
are
we
getting
attention
to
the
whole
of
the
affidavit
of
the
secretary?
do
we
end
the
discussions
thus
far
take
account
of
the
last
paragraph
of
it
or
any
sense
in
determining
to
terminate
the
service
of
mr.
service?
i
did
not
consider
that
i
was
legally
bound
or
required
by
the
opinion
of
the
loyalty
review
board
to
take
such
action.
on
the
contrary,
i
consider
that
the
opinion
of
the
loyalty
review
board
was
merely
an
advisory
recommendation
to
me.
and
that
i
was
legally
free
to
exercise
my
own
judgment
as
to
whether
mr.
service's
employment
should
be
terminated
and
i
did
solely
exercise
that
judgment.
is
that
what
he
said?
