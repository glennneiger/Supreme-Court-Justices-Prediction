did
you
say
--
did
you
say
improper
person
or
presence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
government
--
does
the
government
challenge
the
file
of
the
secretary
to
promulgate
these
regulations
validly?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
claimed
that
these
were
beyond
the
powers
of
the
secretary
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
give
them
this
kind
of
a
hearing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
different
between
this
than
in
the
accorded
regulation.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
they
challenge
him
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
it,
however,
the
government
claimed
that
the
secretary
didn't
have
a
right
to
give
him
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
can
say
they
claimed
they
were
not
applicable,
didn't
he
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
give
notice
to
service,
refer
to
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
difference
on
effect?
do,
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
understand
you
to
say
that
it
will
be
something
wrong
to
tell
somebody
everything
in
the
paper?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there'll
be
nothing
wrong
in
that
and
yet
it'll
be
all
right,
it'll
be
all
wrong
to
turn
over
the
paper?
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
them
to
look
at?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
he
have
to
paraphrase
it?
he
couldn't
give
him
the
exact
language.
the
paraphrases
would
be
alright.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
paraphrased
it
and
he
told
him
precisely
the
same
thing
in
different
words.
that
would
be
all
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
say
the
substance
of
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
all
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
all
right
if
it's
the
substance
of
phase
not
seen.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
know
that
then?
did
the
secretary
of
state
know
that
then
or
was
that
later
decided?
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
the
time
the
secretary
acted
on
it,
it
was
--
i
suppose
to
be
was
it
not,
a
legal
finding
by
board
with
power
to
do
so.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
suppose
he
could
know
how
the
court
would
have
decided
it,
he
have
decided
two
years
later,
did
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
--
did
you
find
anything
in
what
he
said
about
that
order
that
indicates
even
prognosticating
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
it
was
a
bad
order?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
do
you
--
where
do
you
get
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
--
is
that
said
in
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
termination
notice
to
him
that
was
given
on
december
30?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
said
he
acted
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
loyalty
report.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
did
that
loyalty
board
have
a
--
have
jurisdiction
over
everything
besides
loyalty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
but
did
it
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
jurisdiction
over
except
to
cases
relating
to
security
and
loyalty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
did
he
say
or
not
that
he
acted
solely
on
the
basis
of
their
finding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
he
did
or
not
if
--
if
that's
the
sole
thing
they
acted
on
and
all
they
had
to
do
with
was
security
and
loyalty.
how
can
you
say
that
this
man
was
discharged
for
anything
except
something
to
do
with
security
and
loyalty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
of
what
was
said
into
the
loyalty
report.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
still
said,
“i'm
doing
it
solely
on
the
ground
of
what
they
said.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
what
they
told
service,
they
discharged
him
for?
