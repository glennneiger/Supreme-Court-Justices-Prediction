justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
conceded
in
the
theory?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
mean
did
the
government
concede
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr
rhetts,
right
there.
i
gather
the
very
first
sentence
of
paragraph
5.
it
reads,
“i
made
that
determination
solely
as
the
result
of
the
findings
and
so
forth.”
your
reading
--
i
made
that
determination
solely
because
of
the
finding
of
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
where
you're
reading
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
--
i
suppose
that
sentence
later
on
in
which
he
said
there
was
nothing
in
the
opinion
of
the
loyalty
review
board
which
could
make
it
incompatible
with
the
exercise
of
my
responsibilities
as
secretary
of
state
to
act
on
it
implies
that
he
did.
in
fact,
acted
on
it
and
it
alone
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
may
i
--
may
i,
mr.
rhetts,
taking
the
very
last
sentence
and
i
gather
you
suggest
that
that
last
sentence
if
there's
any
possible
inference
from
it
that
there
were
other
considerations
than
merely
the
finding
of
the
loyalty
review
board,
you
can't
read
them
into
that
sentence
in
light
of
the
context
which
precedes
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
take
it
though,
mr.
rhetts.
you
rely
rather
heavily
here
on
the
infirmities
as
you
see
them
in
the
proceedings
before
this
loyalty
review
board.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
if
they
existed
in
the
case
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
put
to
you
would
probably
have
you
here
making
the
same
argument
you're
making
today.
if
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
was
the
same
kind
of
infirmities
in
the
proceedings
before
the
special
board
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
suggested
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
might
have
been
employed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
perhaps,
i've
got
to
wait
until
we
hear
from
the
government,
but
is
there
anything
in
the
government's
brief
which
agrees
that
to
where
those
deficiencies
is
not
whether
or
not
they
did
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
initiated
the
determination
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
whether
those
--
do
they
disagree
with
you
upon
the
existence
of
those
deficiency?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
way
with
service,
the
connection
was
finally
terminated
out
of
the
current
of
that
which
you
say
the
regulations
provide.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
rhetts,
where
is
the
provision
if
there
is
one?
i
find
394.12
at
page
80,
is
this
it,
“dealing
with
a
clearly
favorable
conclusion
that
shall
so
determine
and
notify
the
deputy
under
secretary
through
administration?”
is
that
the
one
which
you
say,
“it
says
that
that
shall
be
the
end
of
the
matter,”
or
is
there
another?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
--
i'm
looking
at
page
80,
394.12
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
something
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
looking
for
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i
want
particularly
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
those
provisions,
which
say
that
when
there
is
a
clearly
favorable
conclusion,
that
shall
be
the
end
of
the
matter
which
i
think
is
what
you
suggested?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
69?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
that's
what
i
want
to
get
to.
so,
there
was
in
fact
a
concurrence
required?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
was
given.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
each
of
the
three
--
on
each
of
the
three
occasion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
had
the
--
had
there
been
a
revision
of
this
requirement
in
anywise
before
the
second
or
third
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
second?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
a
matter
--
as
to
the
fact
though,
mr.
rhetts,
were
either
the
second
or
third
determination,
clearances
subsequent
to
the
revision
in
this
regard?
you
said
he
was
tried
under
the
march,
but
i
think
you
said
earlier,
there
were
three
separate
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
is
to
the
third
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
assuming
all
that
was
two
types
of
decision
that
that
is
not
what
he
did
in
any
event?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
he
said
he
discharged
him
because
of
the
finding
of
loyalty?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
macguineas,
what's
the
significance
of
mr.
rhett's
statement
to
us
yesterday
that
mr.
service
brought
back
his
copies
with
permission?
from
--
from
whom
did
he
have
that
permission?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i'm
asking
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
who
gave
him
that
permission?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
government
agrees
that
he
did
have
permission
to
bring
those
back
with
him
from
china?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what's
the
--
if
--
if
he
was
entitled
to
keep
them,
what
the
permission
contemplate
that
they
were
then
his
own
personal
papers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
macguineas,
his
--
in
his
relations
with
mr.
atkinson,
was
mr.
atkinson
talking
about
the
very
same
papers
that
he
had
turned
over
to
him.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it's
clear
that
they
were
not
the
very
same
papers.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
was
there
anything
--
anything
in
mr.
service's
own
testimony
or
otherwise
to
indicate
mr.
service's
idea,
whether
he
thought
these
copies
were
in
fact
still
classified
at
the
time
he
turned
them
over
to
jaffe?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
he
--
i
would
suppose
so
if
his
honest
conviction
was
if
there
were
papers
he
could
turn
over
to
the
press.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
could
not
have
thought
that
they
were
classified.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
reason
did
service
give?
well,
believing
that
he
committed
no
impropriety
in
turning
these
papers
over
to
jaffe.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
macguineas,
may
i
get
back
with
you
for
a
moment
to
your
comparison
of
the
discretion
under
this
statute
with
the
authority
in
the
president
at
his
pleasure
to
terminate
the
incumbency
of
the
secretary
of
state
himself?
now,
i
gather
the
government's
position
is
that
in
the
case
of
the
president
terminating
the
secretary
of
state.
now,
the
president
may
do
that
at
his
pleasure
whether
or
not
the
president
deems
that
termination
necessary
or
advisable
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states
may.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
well,
now,
what
do
you
do
then
with
the
language
of
section
103
which
while
it
speaks
in
and
--
and
actually
the
wording
is
to
terminate
in
his
absolute
discretion.
that
termination
is
tied
to
a
standard,
isn't
it,
whenever
he
shall
deem
such
termination
necessary
or
advisable
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
the
discretion
is
not
as
complete
and
the
secretary
of
state
to
terminate
mr.
service
as
would
have
been
the
discretion
of
the
--
or
the
authority
of
the
president
to
terminate
mr.
acheson.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no,
please.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
two,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
isn't
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
--
then,
that
being
so,
his
discretion
is
not
as
absolute
as
is
the
authority
of
the
president
to
terminate
him
at
his
pleasure.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
an
important
qualification,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
take
the
precious
sole,
mr.
macguineas,
but
why
--
why
isn't
what
the
secretary
said
reasonably
we
understood
the
saying
in
effect.
well
if
that
board
thinks
that
it's
not
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states
to
continue
mr.
service
in
employment
from
the
state
department,
i
ought
not
asks
for
any
other
assurance
that
perhaps
he
maybe
safely
retained.
but
i'll
follow
the
loyalty
board
and
exercise
my
discretion
since
that's
the
way
they
feel
about
it
determining.
why
can't
that
affidavit
be
reasonably
be
read
as
in
effect
saying
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
if
he
had
known
that,
what
developed
only
two
years
later
or
whatever
the
time
was
much
later,
that
in
fact
that
conclusion
was
not
well-founded
by
the
board
in
light
of
the
erroneous
reliance
upon
some
of
the
material
which
the
board
used
to
reach
its
conclusion.
isn't
it
also
a
--
a
safe
inference
that
he
would
not
have
taken
the
action
he
did
simply
on
the
board's?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suggest
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
if
he
had
said
in
this
affidavit,
i
think,
that
the
board
is
dead
wrong
for
the
reasons
which
subsequently
the
court
said
the
board
was
dead
wrong.
it's
unreasonable
inference
to
suggest
and
say,
i,
therefore,
have
nothing
before
me,
which
indicates
that
he
should
be
terminated
and
i
won't
terminate.
