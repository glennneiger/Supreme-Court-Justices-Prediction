mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari,
directed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
to
review
that
court's
affirmance
of
the
district
court
judgment,
which
denied
petitioner's
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
granted
respondent's
cross-motion.
the
question
in
the
case
is
as
to
the
legality
of
petitioner's
dismissal
from
the
foreign
service
of
the
united
states
by
the
secretary
of
state
on
december
14,
1951.
from
1935
until
december
1951,
petitioner
served
continuously
in
china
as
a
foreign
service
officer
of
the
united
states.
in
1943,
he
was
detached
from
the
foreign
service
at
the
request
of
secretary
of
war
stimson,
and
for
two
years,
served
as
a
political
advisor
to
general
stilwell,
and
when
that
officer
was
relieved
from
command
of
the
china-burma
theater
to
general
wedemeyer.
in
addition
to
general
political
reporting,
petitioner's
duties
when
attached
to
the
military
involved
the
maintenance
of
a
very
close
relationships
with
american
press
representatives
who
visited
the
china
theater
of
war.
and
in
accordance
to
the
general
stilwell's
policies,
freely
briefing
such
press
representatives
on
the
political
situation
in
china
which
provided
the
background
for
the
military
operations
in
that
theater.
in
april
1945,
petitioner
was
recalled
to
the
united
states.
and
before
leaving,
he
sought
and
obtained
permission
from
the
military
authority
under
which
he
functioned
to
retain
and
to
bring
with
him
copies
of
various
--
personal
copies
of
various
memoranda
and
reports,
which
he
had
prepared
while
on
duty
assigned
to
general
stilwell
and
general
wedemeyer.
he
arrived
in
washington
on
april
12,
1945.
now,
on
march
10th,
1945,
more
than
a
month
before
he
returned
to
this
country,
the
office
of
strategic
services
made
a
raid
on
the
offices
of
one
philip
jaffe,
the
editor
of
the
magazine
called
amerasia
in
new
york
city.
on
this
occasion,
the
raiding
officers
discovered
a
large
number
of
government
documents
originating
in
the
files
of
the
o.s.s.,
the
state-war-navy,
and
other
departments
of
the
government.
the
case
was
immediately
turned
over
to
the
fbi
which
after
an
investigation
on
april
18th,
1945,
proposed
to
present
the
case
to
the
department
of
justice
for
prosecution
against
the
magazine
editor
jaffe,
a
state
department
employee,
not
the
petitioner,
a
naval
officer
and
others.
however,
the
case
was
not
been
turned
over
for
prosecution
because
the
state
and
navy
departments
requested
that
the
fbi's
investigation
be
continued
for
an
additional
period.
on
the
next
day,
april
19th,
1945,
petitioner
was
introduced
to
jaffe
by
an
american
naval
officer
on
duty
in
the
far
eastern
branch
of
the
office
of
naval
intelligence
here
in
washington,
who
quite
unknown
to
petitioner
was
one
of
those
implicated
in
the
wholesale
of
government
document
thievery
which
the
o.s.s.and
the
fbi
had
uncovered.
and
so,
it
came
about
that
when
petitioner
was
introduced
to
what
he
supposed
to
be
a
reputable
journalist,
the
editor
of
a
specialist
magazine
on
far
eastern
affairs
by
what
he
supposed
to
be
a
reputable
naval
officer
on
duty
in
the
office
of
--
office
of
naval
intelligence.
he
was
in
fact
being
introduced
to
a
man
on
whom
the
fbi's
net
had
already
closed
and
who
was
quite
literally
wired
for
sound.
believing
jaffe
to
be
a
journalist
of
repute,
the
petitioner
talked
with
jaffe
in
his
hotel
room,
in
jaffe's
hotel
room
in
the
city
of
washington
on
four
different
occasions
between
april
19th
and
may
29th,
1945.
and
he
very
ill-advisedly
lent
to
jaffe
some
copies
of
his
memoranda,
which
i
have
referred
to
before,
which
he
brought
back
with
him
from
china.
these
memoranda
were
characterized
later
by
the
loyalty
review
board
of
the
civil
service
commission
as
being,
and
i
quote
them,
"for
the
most
part,
such
as
a
newspaper
reporter
on
the
spot
would
prepare
for
his
newspaper."
and
as
to
some
of
these,
the
loyalty
review
board
said
they
might
be
considered
as
hot
news.petitioner's
conversations
with
jaffe
were
secretly
recorded
by
the
fbi
by
the
use
of
a
microphone
which
was
planted
in
jaffe's
hotel
room.
on
june
6th,
1945,
petitioner
along
with
jaffe,
the
naval
officer
who
had
introduced
him
to
jaffe,
another
state
department
employee
and
several
others
were
arrested.
and
after
volunteering
his
testimony,
petitioner
was
the
subject
of
a
unanimous
no
true
bill
returned
by
the
grand
jury
in
his
case.
he
was
thereafter
duly
restored
to
duty
after
hearing
before
the
board
of
foreign
service
personnel.
now,
five
years
later,
in
1950,
petitioner
along
with
the
then
secretary
of
state
acheson
and
others
was
the
subject
of
a
personal
attack
on
the
floor
of
the
united
states
senate.
and
shortly
thereafter,
the
loyalty
review
board
of
the
civil
service
commission
directed
the
state
department's
loyalty
security
board
to
reopen
its
previous
favorable
findings
as
to
petitioner's
loyalty
and
as
to
whether
or
not
he
was
a
security
risk.
and
directed
the
state
department
board
to
prefer
charges
against
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
--
petitioner.
the
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
yes.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
yes.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
the
no
true
bill
was
1945.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
he
was
the
subject
of
investigation
at
various
times.
the
president's
loyalty
order
did
not
come
along
until
1947.
thereafter,
in
accordance
with
the
direction
of
that
court
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
in
new
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
in
new
posts,
received
promotions
and
so
on.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
1947.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
he
was.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
in
the
state
department.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
by
--
precisely,
by
the
machinery
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
when
they
got
to
him
precisely
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
--
i
do
not
know.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
the
upshot
of
that
was
that
he
was
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
--
clear.
they
found
no
doubt
of
his
loyalty
and
they
found
that
he
was
not
a
security
risk.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
no.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
no.
no,
he
was
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
precisely.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
and
so,
when
the
loyalty
review
board
directed
that
the
theretofore
favorable
findings
of
the
state
department's
loyalty
security
board
be
reopened,
they
directed
the
state
department
then
to
prefer
charges
against
petitioner
and
to
give
him
a
hearing.
and
so,
in
march
1950,
petitioner
was
on
route
to
a
new
post
in
kolkata.
he
was
ordered
to
return
to
washington
where
he
was
served
with
a
formal
charge
by
the
chairman
of
the
state
department
loyalty
security
board,
acting
for
the
secretary
of
state,
charging
that
he
was
a
security
risk
and
that
there
was
reason
to
believe
him
disloyal
to
the
united
states,
because
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
was
an
associate
of
improper
persons.
after
a
month
of
exhausted
hearings
interrupt
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
persons.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
i
have
characterized
the
substance
of
that
charge.
after
about
a
month
of
hearings
which
were
interrupted
toward
the
end
by
hearing
before
a
subcommittee
of
the
senate
foreign
relations
committee,
the
tydings
subcommittee.
the
state
department
loyalty
board
found
in
october
1950
that
petitioner
was
neither
disloyal
nor
a
security
risk.
this
finding
was
approved
by
the
deputy
under
secretary
of
state
in
accordance
with
the
regulations
thereafter.
thereafter,
the
loyalty
review
board
again
assumed
jurisdiction
of
the
case
on
post-audit.
and
after
holding
the
case
for
a
while,
returned
it
to
the
state
department
for
further
reconsideration
of
some
supplemental
information
which
had
been
supplied.
the
state
department
board
did
reconsider
it,
reaffirmed
its
favorable
finding,
the
deputy
under
secretary
approved
the
favorable
findings
and
the
case
went
back
to
the
loyalty
review
board.
while
it
was
there
at
this
time,
the
president's
executive
order
had
been
--
was
amended
to
alter
the
standards
for
determining
loyalty.
and
so,
the
case
was
returned
to
the
state
department
for
a
second
reconsideration
under
the
new
standards
of
the
executive
order
10241.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
it
was
after
--
it
was
after
the
first
of
may
and
before
the
middle
of
july
of
1950.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
yes.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
excuse
me,
1951.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
that's
right.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
and
at
the
end
of
july
1951,
the
loyalty
security
board
again
reaffirmed
its
favorable
decision,
finding
petitioner
not
to
be
of
doubtful
loyalty
under
the
new
standard.
thereafter,
in
mid
october
1951,
the
loyalty
review
board
of
the
civil
service
commission
advised
petitioner
that
a
further
hearing
would
be
held
in
his
case
under
that
board's
regulation,
number
14,
which
has
since
been
held
at
least
in
part
invalid
by
this
court
in
peters
against
hobby.
and
a
hearing
was
held
on
november
the
8th,
1951.
on
december
13,
1951,
the
loyalty
review
board
notified
petitioner
that
it
had
reversed
the
finding
of
the
state
department
loyalty
security
board
and
found
that
there
was
a
reasonable
doubt
of
petitioner's
loyalty.
now,
this
finding
and
purported
a
reversal
of
the
state
department
board
was
not
only
rendered
in
what
this
court
has
held
to
be
a
lawless
assumption
of
jurisdiction.
in
our
view,
it
grossly
violated
both
the
executive
order
and
the
fifth
amendment
in
other
respects.
i
have
referred
to
the
fact
that
petitioner's
conversations
with
jaffe
were
recorded
by
the
fbi,
both
before
the
state
department
loyalty
security
board
during
his
hearings
there
and
before
the
loyalty
review
board
during
his
hearing
there.
various
questions
were
put
to
petitioner,
which
indicated
that
his
judges
had
some
kind
of
information
as
to
what
he
was
supposed
to
have
said
to
jaffe
and
jaffe
to
him
some
five
years
earlier.
but
his
request
for
access
to
whatever
the
board's
had
in
their
possession
was
denied.
the
loyalty
security
board
of
the
state
department
admitted
that
it
did
not
have
before
it
the
texts,
the
exact
texts
of
the
fbi
recordings
of
the
conversations.
and
the
government
in
this
litigation
has
admitted
that
there
were
no
confidential
informants
involved
in
the
case.
and
that
petitioner's
judges
had
before
them
only
what
purported
to
be
summaries
and
digests
of
these
conversations
which
had
been
wiretapped
and
recorded,
but
not
the
exact
recordings,
not
the
recordings
themselves
or
any
exact
transcripts
of
them.
now,
in
this
case,
we
know
for
a
fact
that
these
purported
digests
and
summaries
were
highly
inaccurate
and
unreliable
because
one
of
them,
a
purported
transcript
of
the
conversation
of
may
8,
1945
was
shown
to
petitioner
at
a
hearing
before
the
tydings
subcommittee.
this
document
which
was
exhibited
to
him
and
which
is
printed
in
the
hearings
of
that
subcommittee
showed
on
its
face
that
it
was
in
many
particulars
highly
inaccurate
as
a
transcript
of
what
the
two
men
said
to
each
other.
and
in
other
respects
was
and
frankly
labeled
so
unintelligent.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
yes.
in
certain
places,
there
was
--
the
transcriber
simply
put
(voice
overlap)
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
in
other
places,
the
inaccuracy
was
apparent
from
the
face
of
it
plus
any
minimal
knowledge
of
international
affairs,
because
it
had
these
two
men
saying
things
to
each
other,
which
was
180
degrees
the
opposite
of
what
they
would
have
said
and
anyone
could
tell.
finally,
the
loyalty
review
board
opinion
which
found
petitioner
to
be
of
reasonably
doubtful
loyalty
shows
on
its
face
that
that
board
relied
in
major
part
on
these
grossly
inaccurate
digests
and
summaries
of
the
wiretap
conversations
in
reaching
their
conclusion
as
to
petitioner's
loyalty.
and
that
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
yes.
and
i
should
say
there,
mr.
justice,
that
--
that
that
was
done
at
page
2466
of
the
tydings
hearings,
and
there's
an
unfortunate
inaccuracy
in
my
brief,
which
refers
to
a
different
page
where
nothing
like
that
occurred.
the
proper
page
in
the
tydings
hearing
which
is
where
the
petitioner's
loyalty
board
hearing
is
printed
up,
page
2466
of
the
appendix
to
the
tydings
hearing.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
yes.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
this
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
this
question
is
relevant
as
i
shall
very
shortly
point
out.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
i
can
give
it
to
you.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
now,
we
think
it
plain
therefore
that
both
the
executive
or
the
loyalty
executive
order
and
the
fifth
amendment
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
--
required
not
only
that
petitioner
have
an
opportunity
to
meet
the
evidence
against
him,
to
explain
it
and
to
refute
it
if
he
could
but
that
his
judges
have
access
to
the
evidence
on
the
basis
of
which
they
presumed
to
judge.
and
we
maintain
that
both
the
executive
order
and
the
fifth
amendment
require
that.
well,
these
were
the
circumstances
under
which
the
loyalty
review
board
purported
to
reverse
the
favorable
finding
of
the
state
department
board.
and
on
the
same
day
that
the
loyalty
review
board
announced
its
decision,
the
secretary
of
state
executed
its
mandate
by
dismissing
petitioner
after
16
years
about
standing
performance
in
the
foreign
service.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
that
is
the
action
of
which
we
complain.
now,
the
first
major
ground
on
which
we
rest
our
claim
that
this
action
was
invalid
is
that
by
relying
solely
on
this
unlawful
and
invalid
finding
of
the
loyalty
review
board
as
the
basis
for
his
determination
to
discharge
petitioner.
the
secretary's
dismissal
action
represented
at
best
an
arbitrary
exercise
of
his
discretion,
which
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
perkins
against
elg
and
later
cases
was
to
be
set
aside
as
invalid.
now,
there
is
no
question
here
but
that
the
unlawful
finding
of
the
loyalty
review
board
does
in
fact
constitute
the
sole
basis
for
the
secretary's
exercise
of
his
discretion.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
i
say
there
is
no
question
here
in
this
case
but
that
the
unlawful
finding
of
the
loyalty
review
board
constitutes
the
sole
basis
for
the
secretary's
action.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
we
have
his
own
statement
in
his
affidavit.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
yes.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
putting
aside
--
putting
aside
an
independent
difficulty
that
we
have
in
this
case,
had
it
--
under
the
statute
had
he
never
issued
any
regulations
to
govern
himself.
i
will
concede
that
he
could
have
simply
thought
about
of
the
blue
that
it
was
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
precisely.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
precisely.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
under
the
statute
he
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
--
certainly
could.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
that
is
correct.
now,
he
gave
his
reason
in
an
affidavit
which
he
supplied
to
the
government
after
this
litigation
commenced.
it
appears
at
--
commencing
it
on
page
8
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
that
is
to
say
the
government
requested
him
for
an
affidavit
as
in
support
of
its
motion
for
summary
judgment
papers.
on
its
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
precisely.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
on
page
82
of
the
record,
paragraph
5
of
his
affidavit,
he
refers
to
his
determination
to
discharge
the
petitioner.
and
he
says,
"i
made
that
determination,
solely
as
the
result
of
the
finding
of
the
loyalty
review
board.
i
did
not
make
any
independent
determination
of
my
own
as
to
whether
on
the
evidence
submitted
before
those
boards
there
was
a
reasonable
doubt
of
mr.
service's
loyalty.
i
made
no
independent
judgment
on
the
record
in
this
case."
now,
it
is
our
position
that
an
exercise
of
executive
discretion
resting
as
the
secretary
so
handedly
states,
“this
one
did
solely
on
such
a
wholly
unlawful
foundation,
constitutes
an
abuse
of
discretion
or
an
arbitrary
exercise
of
discretion
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.”
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
i've
had
some
difficulty
in
understanding
precisely
what
that
means.
i
--
i
assume
that
it
meant
that
on
its
face,
the
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
that's
right.
indeed
--
indeed,
my
--
my
--
it
is
my
--
i
suggest
that
either
he
acted
on
--
he
acted
on
one
or
two
assumptions.
now,
the
law
--
the
government
contends
for
example
that
he
makes
clear
that
he
did
not
act
on
the
assumption
that
he
was
legally
required
to
follow
the
opinion
of
the
loyalty
review
board.
now,
there's
--
despite
considerable
contemporaneous
evidence
to
the
contrary,
we
accept
his
assertion
in
his
affidavit
that
he
did
not
deemed
himself
legally
required
to
do
so.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
but
we
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
that
he
found
himself
legally.
he
--
he
was
not
required
to
but
he
found
himself
legally
free
to
do
so.
now,
our
position
is
that
he
was
--
that
that
is
the
misapprehension
which
we
complain.
he
was
not
legally
free
to
do
so.
now,
i
--
i
suggest
to
you
that
that
is
the
demonstrable
in
these
terms.
either
he
acted
on
the
assumption
that
the
opinion
and
finding
of
the
loyalty
review
board
was
a
valid
one,
a
lawful
one
or
he
acted
on
the
assumption
that
whether
it
was
valid
and
lawful
or
not,
he
was
free
to
rest
his
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
in
fact,
i
did
and
i
relied
on
this
and
nothing
else.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
yes.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
yes.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
i
take
it
that
the
following
language
would
support
that
where
he
says,
“i
--
i
made
no
--
i
did
not
--
in
making
this
determination,
i
did
not
read
the
testimony.
i
made
no
independent
judgment
on
the
record.”
i
assume
what
he
is
saying
is
that
i
looked
to
the
loyalty
review
board
opinion
alone
and
relying
exclusively
on
that,
i
reached
the
conclusion
that
was
appropriate
and
advisable
to
terminate.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
it
seems
to
me
that
--
that
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
i
have
no
question.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
yes.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
that's
--
that
--
that
is
why
--
how
i
read
the
--
and
i
would
not
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
it
alone.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
and
it
seems
to
me
either
by
reciting
the
various
things
that
he
did
not
do
such
as
make
a
judgment
on
the
record
and
the
whole.
he
--
he
is
saying
that
i
look
to
this
opinion
and
because
it
purported
to
reverse
my
board.
i
deemed
it
appropriate
to
discharge
him
without
further
consideration,
the
merits
or
anything
else
by
it.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
that
is
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
i'm
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
i
must
--
except
one
thing,
if
they
were
not
for
another
matter
which
i
will
come
to
shortly,
some
regulations.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
but
at
the
time,
the
statute
had
been
passed,
had
he
never
issued
any
regulations
and
had
he
said,
“i
deem
it
in
the
advisable
and
the
interest
of
the
united
states
to
discharge
this
petitioner
without
any
hearing,
without
anything
else.”
he'd
been
perfectly
free
to
do
so,
but
he
did
not
do
that.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
that
is
my
belief
as
to
what
a
fair
reading
of
this
affidavit
is.
now
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
well,
i
suggest
that
it
is
inconsistent
but
i'm
not
relying
on
the
press
release
anymore.
i
accept
his
assertion,
his
statement
that
he
was
--
he
was
not
--
he
didn't
think
he
was
required
to
follow
the
loyalty
review
board.
he
says
that
here
and
i
accept
that.
but
he
did
say
that
he
was
free
to
do
so
and
i
deny
that
he
was
free
to
do
so.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
no,
that's
what
he
--
that's
what
he
did
do
without
putting
in
that
he
didn't
have
time
to
do
it,
but
i
say
--
i
say
he's
not
free
at
all.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
but
i
do
not
--
i
do
not
think
he
could
do
it
arbitrarily.
and
of
course
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
oh,
yes.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
oh,
yes.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
that's
right.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
that
--
that
is
--
seems
to
me
is
the
difference
between
the
assumption
that
he
did
it
arbitrarily.
i
--
i
take
it,
the
law
would
be
clear
that
he
could
not
do
it
arbitrarily.
on
the
other
hand,
he
is
not
required.
he
would
--
here,
he
could
act
and
not
be
required
to
give
his
reasons
and
the
law
would
presume
that
he
had
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
precisely.
that's
our
position.
and
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
there
is
no
point
in
going
further.
that
is
our
position.
that
is
what
the
elg
case
teaches
and
teaches
properly.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
well,
indeed,
his
regulations
which
is
a
branch
of
the
case,
i
would
turn
to
next
to
provide
substantially
in
that
--
along
that
line,
not
a
group
outside
distinguishes
but
it
provides
a
mechanism
which
does
not
require
him
personally.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
that's
right.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
yes.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
i'm
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
yes.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
oh,
yes.
had
there
been
any
special
board
created,
and
it
acted
in
such
a
way,
acted
even
properly,
and
the
secretary
relied
solely
on
that,
i
would
equally
be
here
today.
and
this
is
why,
mr.
justice,
in
response
to
your
question
a
while
ago,
i
think,
that
the
deficiencies
of
the
loyalty
review
board
findings
here
are
not
merely,
and
i
don't
mean
by
this
to
minimize,
not
merely
the
technical
exceeding
of
its
jurisdiction.
but
there
are
substantive
deficiencies
in
the
action
so
that
those
--
the
action
of
those
men
cannot
be
deemed
as
just
the
volunteer
of
opinion
of
three
distinguished
men.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
no.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
no,
but
i
--
and
that
is
why
i
say
these
additional
deficiencies
to
which
i
referred,
namely,
the
use
of
--
the
improper
use
of
--
of
this
material
to
which
the
petitioner
never
had
an
opportunity
to
--
to
refute
and
the
improper
use
of
material
upon
which
his
judges
judge
him,
judged,
vitiated
their
action
even
if
you
conceive
of
them
as
three
private
individuals
to
whom
he
might
have
turned
to
in
a
volunteered
capacity.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
no
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
they
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
yes.
they
--
they
concede
that
the
--
that
there
was
the
deficiency
as
to
the
jurisdiction.
that
is
they
agree
that
the
loyalty
review
board
had
no
jurisdiction.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
under
peters
and
hobby.
they
do
not
concede
that
there
is
anything
wrong
with
refusing
petitioner
the
opportunity
to
see
the
material
which
he
--
was
being
used
against
him
nor
do
they
concede
that
there'd
be
anything
wrong,
in
fact
that
his
judges
had
access
to
nothing
more
than
these
summaries
of
inadequate
materials
as
we
could
see
them.
well,
now,
turning
to
the
second
and
independent
ground
on
which
we
base
our
contention
as
to
the
invalidity
of
this
dismissal.
it
is
important
to
commence
here,
but
i
should
say
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said,
our
position
here
is
that
the
secretary
violated
regulations
which
he
himself
imposed
on
himself
to
control
his
--
as
to
the
manner
in
which
he
would
exercise
his
absolute
discretion
under
the
mccarran
rider.
now,
on
this
phase
of
the
case,
the
place
we
start
is
the
formal
letter
of
charges
which
was
preferred
against
him
and
which
appears
beginning
at
page
28
of
the
record,
which
was
the
commencement
of
the
proceeding.
now,
this
letter
of
charges
which
was
dated
march
24,
1950,
first
referred
to
the
president's
loyalty
order
and
then
to
the
regulations
and
procedures
promulgated
on
march
11
by
the
state
department,
and
stating
that
a
copy
of
these
regulations
was
enclosed.
the
letter
then
refer
--
preferred
specific
charges
against
the
petitioner
under
specified
sections
of
these
regulations.
and
then,
it
advised
petitioner
that
a
hearing
had
been
scheduled
under
section
395
of
these
regulations,
and
i'm
reading
at
the
bottom
of
page
29,
“to
consider
this
charge
with
a
view
to
making
a
recommendation
to
the
sectary
of
state
whether
or
not
under
the
provisions
of
the
department
of
state
appropriation
act,
etcetera,
your
employment
in
the
department
should
be
terminated
in
the
interest
of
united
states.”
now,
then,
the
--
the
statute
to
which
reference
is
there
made
and
the
language
which
is
used
is
what
is
commonly
called
the
mccarran
rider.
and
the
language
quoted
is
a
verbatim
"from
the
mccarran
rider,"
a
rider
which
was
annually
attached
to
the
state
department
appropriation
act
for
a
number
of
years.
the
letter
of
charges
then
goes
on
to
fix
a
date
for
hearing,
invites
a
reply
to
the
charges
and
offers
to
give
further
details
of
the
charges
orally.
now,
we
submit
that
on
any
fair
view
of
the
matter,
this
formal
letter
of
charges,
which
in
its
accusation
and
its
consequences
is
so
much
like
a
criminal
indictment.
it
must
be
regarded
as
establishing
the
framework,
procedural
and
substantive
for
all
the
subsequent
proceeding.
as
plainly
as
language
can
make
it,
it
said,
“we
are
going
to
give
you
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
under
the
mccarran
rider,
your
dismissal
is
necessary
or
advisable
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states.
and
it
said,
“the
answer
to
this
question
will
depend
in
turn
on
whether
you
are
found
to
be
of
doubtful
loyalty
or
a
security
risk.
we're
going
to
try
you
under
regulations
of
march
11,
1949.
we
here
with
furnish
you
a
copy
of
them
so
that
from
these,
you
may
ascertain
first
what
the
charges
are
against
you,
and
what
the
rules
of
your
trial
will
be.

rhetts

commencing
at
the
bottom
of
page
28,
exhibit
b.
it
runs
on
to
page
30.
now,
turning
to
these
regulations
themselves
and
there
set
forth
commencing
at
pages
61
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
they
establish,
first,
substantive
standards
and
procedural
rules
relating
to
loyalty
adjudications
under
the
loyalty
executive
order.
the
second
category
of
substantive
standards
laid
down
on
the
so-called
security
principles
and
the
regulations
regarding
this
provide
at
page
61
and
62
of
our
appendix,
section
391.3.
in
addition,
the
secretary
of
state
has
been
granted
by
congress
the
right
in
his
absolute
discretion
to
terminate
the
employment
and
so
on.
that
is
a
verbatim
quotation
from
the
mccarran
rider
and
we
turn
the
page
and
then
they
say,
“in
the
exercise
of
this
right,
the
department
will
so
far
as
possible
afford
its
employees
the
same
protection
as
those
provided
under
the
executive
order.
and
the
regulations
proceed
to
do
just
that.
so
far
as
they're
relevant
here,
they
first
provide
that
if
the
loyalty
security
board,
the
state
department,
if
its
decision
is
favorable
to
the
employee
and
if
that
decision
is
confirmed
by
the
deputy
assistant
secretary
for
administration,
he
will
so
notify
the
employee,
and
the
case
is
closed.
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
received
such
favorable
decisions
from
the
lawyer
of
the
security
board,
three
different
times.
under
the
regulations
therefore,
the
case
should
have
been
ended
after
the
first
of
these
favorable
decisions.
instead,
the
loyalty
review
board
twice
caused
the
case
to
be
reopened
and
after
the
second
of
this,
the
secretary
of
state
interposed
his
own
adverse
determination
in
violation
of
his
own
regulation.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
march
11,
1949.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
they
were
subsequently
amended
on
may
4th,
1951,
and
again
on
september
21,
1951.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
the
government
contends
so,
we
contend
not.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
that
is
an
issue
which
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
so
far
as
i
know,
there
has
been
no
suggestion
to
the
contrary
that
that
was
normal.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
the
one
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
the
one
ultimately
adopted
in
this
case.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
even
to
that
part,
a
contention,
yes.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
well,
that's
right.
it
was
--
it
was
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
i
can't
say
what
was
in
fact
on
in
other
cases
but
it's
certainly
departed
from
the
regulations.
that
is
to
say
and
my
position
is
that
the
petitioner
here
was
tried
under
the
regulations,
also
to
that
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
and
the
regulations
as
i
have
just
said
purport
to
be
issued
under
the
mccarran
rider,
and
he
was
given
a
hearing,
and
he
was
tried
under
these
regulations.
these
were
the
regulations
supplied
to
him.
the
only
copy
he
ever
had
was
tendered
to
him
as
a
part
of
his
formal
letter
of
charges.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
i
think
it
is
exactly
what
the
regulations
required
and
i
sought
not.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
that's
my
position
and
we
sought
an
opportunity
to
press
it
on
the
secretary
of
state
at
the
time
before
denying
it.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
i
didn't
get
where
you
were
referring
to.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
as
i
think
the
trouble
there,
mr.
justice
brennan,
is
that
you're
now
into
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
--
the
later
version
of
the
regulation.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
that
is
one
place
it
says
it
in
the
later
version
and
i
rely
on
that
so
far
as
the
earlier
version,
the
march
12
regulations.
that
appears
at
--
in
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
--
390.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
that's
right.
well,
that
appears
--
commencing
at
the
bottom
of
page
69.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
see,
the
trouble
is
we
have
two
sets
of
regulations.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
you
put
your
finger
on
the
version
of
the
later
regulations,
which
the
government
contends
are
controlling,
and
i
contend
that
point
that
you
referred
to
favors
this.
the
earlier
regulations,
commences
at
the
bottom
of
page
69
and
says
that
“upon
recede
of
the
record
including
the
decision
of
the
loyalty
security
board,
if
the
assistant
secretary
--
that
the
decision
of
the
loyalty
security
board
is
favorable
to
the
officer
or
employee
concerned
and
is
to
heard
in
by
the
assistant
secretary,
he
will
notify
the
officer
or
employee.”
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
that's
right.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
that
was
given
here.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
yes.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
no
question
about
that.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
well,
you
have
put
your
finger
on
the
--
on
the
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
--
on
the
related
--
on
the
comparable
provision
applicable
under
the
later
version.
there,
the
only
difference
--
there,
it
said
that
in
the
event
of
a
favorable
decision
by
the
loyalty
security
board,
if
the
decision
is
on
question
of
loyalty,
the
later
regulations
that
you
just
referred
to,
say
if
the
decision
is
to
loyalty
he
should
be
--
the
employee
must
be
notified
that
the
loyalty
decision
is
subject
to
post-audit
by
the
loyalty
review
board.
now,
we
know
from
the
decision
of
this
court
that
post-audit
cannot
extend
to
reversal
of
a
favorable
decision
of
the
state
department
board.
and
so,
you'll
come
to
the
same
place.
you
can
post-audit
all
you
like
but
you
can't
reverse
a
favorable
decision.
and
so,
again
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
yes,
and
the
courts
below
have
so
held.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
yes.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
yes.
the
government
makes
both
those
contention.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
i
take
it
so
because
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
that's
--
that's
right.
the
government
makes
two
contentions
which
i'll
--
which
i
will
come
to.
i
think
i
might
as
well
pass
any
argument
on
the
proposition
that
this
later
version
of
--
of
regulation,
we
maintained
they
were
not
--
the
later
version
was
not
applicable.
that
is
the
september
21,
1951,
regulations
were
not
applicable
to
this
case
because
he
was
tried
under
the
march
14,
1959
--
1949
regulation.
the
later
version
was
promulgated
after
his
trial
was
all
over,
and
we
say
that
they
may
not
be
retroactively
applied
to
the
decision
of
this
case,
which
plaintiff
was
represented
to
him
that
he
would
be
tried
under
the
1949
legislation.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
the
regulations
have
been
first
amended
in
may
1951.
the
second
reconsideration
by
the
loyalty
security
board
under
the
new
standard,
but
no
hearing,
just
a
reconsideration
was
in
july
31.
so,
to
that
extent,
that
action
occurred
after
the
first
of
the
amendment.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
no
action
except
the
final
action
of
the
secretary,
discharge
the
petition.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
yes.
that
is
the
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
no.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
because
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
because
they
maintained.
congress
did
not
intend
that
the
secretary
should
in
anyway
better
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
--
his
own
exercises
of
his
absolute
discretion.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
and
that
is
what
--
that
is
the
sole
ground
upon
which
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
--
founded
their
act.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
that
is
correct.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
now,
we
maintain
that
these
1951
regulations
were
equally
violated
in
one
of
the
respects
which
i
had
just
mentioned
to
mr.
--
to
you,
mr.
justice
brennan.
another
is
a
provision
under
section
392.1
of
the
amended
version
which
appears
at
page
75
of
our
appendix.
that
--
that
section
requires
that
both
as
to
loyalty
adjudications
and
security
risk
adjudications,
a
decision
for
removal
of
an
employee
shall
be
reached
after
consideration
of
the
complete
file,
arguments,
briefs,
and
testimony
presented.
now,
we
submit
that
it
can
hardly
be
said
that
this
requirement
was
met
when
the
secretary
read
and
relied
solely
on
this
unlawful
finding
of
the
loyalty
review
board
while
disregarding
all
the
remainder
of
the
record,
all
the
testimony,
including
the
favorable
opinions
of
his
own
loyalty
security
board.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
that
is
correct
and
if
i
may
i
shall
come
to
that
now.
so,
those
are
the
two
respects
in
which
we
maintain
that
even
if
they
could
be
applied,
the
1951
version
of
the
regulations
were
equally
violated.
but
as
has
been
suggested,
the
government
maintains
that
these
regulations,
first
of
all,
were
not
in
terms
applicable
to
this
action.
and
they
also
maintained
and
the
court
below
have
held
that
even
if
applicable,
the
regulations
were
invalid.
now
--
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
yes.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
yes.
as
i
understand
the
government's
position
that
--
that
the
regulations
were
not
in
terms
applicable,
they
--
it
rest
on
these
propositions.
first,
they
say
that
the
mccarran
rider
authority,
this
broad
authority
to
dismiss
in
the
absolute
discretion
of
the
secretary,
whatever
he
deems
it
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states,
embraces
cases
--
this
is
an
argument
which
they
have
developed
in
page
28
of
their
brief.
they
say,
“the
mccarran
rider
authority
embraces
cases
other
than
those
of
persons
whose
loyalty
or
security
is
doubted,”
a
broader
category.
secondly,
as
i
understand
their
argument,
they
say
that
the
secretary's
regulations
here
dealt
only
with
loyalty
and
security
cases.
and
in
purport
to
--
to
proscribe
procedures
applicable
to
some
other
kind
of
case
which
he
might
have
decided
under
the
broad
authority
of
--
of
the
rider.
consequently,
they
say,
“since
the
petitioner
was
in
fact
discharged
without
regard
to
the
regulation,
he
must
have
been
discharged
for
some
reason
other
than
loyalty
or
security.”
now,
of
course,
the
trouble
with
this
argument
is
that
while
the
mccarran
rider
may
embrace
authority
to
make
dismissals
on
other
than
loyalty-security
ground
or
security
grounds,
it
certainly
did
embrace
those
grounds
among
others.
secondly,
the
state
department
considered
this
legislation
as
it
stated
in
the
report
to
the
congress
as
an
additional
standard
for
dealing
with
security
problem.
this
petitioner
was
specifically
charged
under
the
mccarran
rider
with
being
of
doubtful
loyalty
and
a
security
risk.
he
was
tried
and
he
was
found
innocent
on
those
charges.
and
everybody,
from
beginning
to
end,
including
the
loyalty
review
board
on
whose
unlawful
finding
the
secretary
relied
solely
thought
they
were
tried
and
dealing
with
charges
of
loyalty
and
security.
but
the
government
says,
“even
though
the
secretary
held
out
a
promise
to
be
here,”
he
was
free
in
the
end
to
say,
"i've
never
intended
to
apply
these
procedures
to
you
that
i'd
said
i'd
apply.
i'm
going
to
find
you
guilty
of
something
other
than
i
had
charged
you
with
and
i
won't
even
now
tell
you
what
it
is."
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
precisely.
mr.
c.
edward
rhetts
that's
right.
and
i
--
i
say
that
this
is
somewhat
unattractive
position.
it's
not
the
one
that
the
secretary
adopted
for
himself.
he
purported,
tried
this
man
on
loyalty
and
security
grounds.
and
--
and
even
had
he
pursued
this
other
technique,
i
can't
believe
that
he
could
find
the
sanction
of
law.
and
so,
for
both
of
these
reasons,
that
is
because
that
--
well,
there
remains
the
courts
the
other
argument
that
the
--
the
courts
have
found
that
it
was
not
the
intent
of
congress
that
he
should
impose
any
regulations
onto
himself.
and
consequently,
the
regulations
even
though
in
terms
applicable,
even
though
the
secretary
represented
that
they
would
be
applied
must
--
may
be
disregarded.
now,
we
submit
that
this
position
is
--
as
untenable
as
the
government's
other
position
for
there's
no
shred
of
--
of
evidence
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
legislation
to
suggest
that
congress
ever
had
any
such
intention
affirmatively
to
prevent
the
exercise
of
this
broad
discretionary
authority
in
accordance
with
civilized
standards.
and
indeed,
there
is
positive
evidence
that
the
congress
by
twice
reenacting
this
legislation
after
receiving
a
report
of
the
secretary
of
state,
positively
approved
his
method
of
applying
it
because
the
secretary
of
state
has
represented
that
he
conceive
the
mccarran
rider
to
be
subject
to
procedural
limitation
and
advised
the
congress
that
he
had
in
fact
promulgated
procedural
regulations
governing
his
conduct,
both
under
the
mccarran
rider
and
under
the
loyalty
executive
order.
consequently,
we
say
that
both
for
the
reason
that
his
action
was
arbitrary
and
that
it
was
a
departure
from
valid,
applicable
regulations
which
he
imposed
on
himself,
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
must
be
reversed.
