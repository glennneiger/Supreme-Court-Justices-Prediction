justice
felix
frankfurter
i
missed
that,
mr.
rhetts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
was
a
--
there
was
a
no
true
bill
by
the
grand
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
--
up
to
that
moment,
was
he
still
in
the
department?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
when
did
he
--
when
was
he
detached
from
or
--
or,
and
when
was
there
an
investigation
by
the
state
department's
loyalty
board
after
this
no
true
bill?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
continued
from
1945
to
1947
as
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
state
department
officer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
go
from
--
go
on
from
there,
before
you
get
to
the
restoration
of
the
inquiry.
what
--
when
--
when
was
there
the
first,
the
security
scheme
came
into
--
in
1947,
is
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
was
he
then
subjected
at
once
to
a
loyalty
investigation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
state
department?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
the
department's
loyalty
board?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
1947
--
1947?
what
happened?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
what
was
the
upshot
of
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
clear?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
he
--
was
he
suspended
during
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
state
department
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
until
1950
--
until
the
point
you
had
reached
when
i
interrupted
you,
until
the
loyalty
board
of
the
civil
service
commission
directed
the
state
department's
loyalty
board
to
reexamine
if
he
had
continuously
continued
in
the
service
of
the
state
department.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
its
face,
meaning
just
by
reading
it,
you
could
tell
me
it
was
inaccurate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
unintelligible
but
inaccurate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
because
of
these
various
proceedings,
mr.
rhetts,
was
a
specific
request
made
by
counsel
for
service
for
these
documents
on
the
basis
of
which
the
civil
service
board
acted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
take
it
that
you're
putting
this
before
us
because
in
the
chain
of
your
argument,
this
becomes
relevant
as
to
the
disposition
and
the
sovereign
considered
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
this
question
is
relevant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
page
22.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
is
that
the
act
of
dismissal
which
was
the
basis
of
this
proceeding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
could
he
have
taken
this
action
out
of
the
air
without
ever
looking
at
what
the
loyalty
board
did?
i
mean
as
a
matter
of
law,
as
a
matter
of
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
his
own
observation
--
his
own
observation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
discuss
of
a
man's
judgment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
asking.
i
don't
know.
could
he
as
a
matter
of
power
under
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
the
secretary
of
state
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
say,
"all
right,
this
fellow's
judgment
is
not
for
this
kind
of
work."
now,
what
you
say
is
he
didn't
do
that
and
since
he
gave
a
reason,
his
action
must
be
judged
by
his
reason.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
supply
with
a
reference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
by
way
of
affidavit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
next
step
mean
in
the
secretary's
--
the
ex-secretary's
affidavit?
there
was
nothing
on
page
--
there
was
nothing
in
the
opinion
of
the
loyalty
review
board,
which
would
make
it
incompatible
with
the
exercise
of
my
responsibility,
the
secretary
of
state.
what
does
that
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
was
asked
to
do
something
that
the
law
prepared,
i
assume.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
next
sentence
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
was
that.
the
next
--
the
sentence
after
the
one
we've
just
been
talking
about,
i
deemed
it
appropriate
advisable
to
act
on
the
basis
of
the
finding
and
opinion
of
the
loyalty
review
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
these
are
a
lot
words
we'd
say.
although,
i
was
illegally
bound,
in
fact
i
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
haven't
read
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
haven't
read
that
paragraph.
when
i
asked
you
the
question
that
namely,
a
little
while
ago,
whether
out
of
the
blue
or
in
his
judgment
or
for
reasons
that
can't
be
put
into
words,
subject
of
course,
the
secretary
of
state
could
--
could
sever
employment.
your
answer
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
this
mean
is
that
--
that
there
a
lot
words
to
say.
i
could
not
have
been
mandamus
to
do
this.
i
wasn't
violating
any
of
my
responsibility
to
the
secretary
of
state.
in
fact,
what
i
did,
i
did
because
the
loyalty
board
recommended
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
legally
that
if
--
if
he
said
in
explicit
words,
if
he
said
in
terminating
the
service
of
--
the
employment
of
his
service,
“i
acted
on
my
discretion
as
secretary
of
state,”
you
wouldn't
be
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
here
because
he
--
he
precisely
did
not
say
that
and
said
the
opposite
to
wit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
felt
free
to
act
on
that
and
i
did
act
on
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
he
had
said
it,
would
it
make
a
difference
mr.
rhetts,
if
the
secretary
is
--
was
then
the
secretary
had
said,
“under
the
law,
i
have
power
to
exercise
my
independent
judgment
about
any
officer's
continuance
in
the
foreign
service,”
if
this
man
was
in
the
foreign
service.
i
haven't
got
time
to
exercise
my
discretion
and
the
only
self-respecting
way
which
i
could,
namely,
to
read
all
the
testimony,
to
inform
myself,
to
listen
to
my
people
practically
consider
the
committing
magistrate.
i
just
haven't
got
time.
when
was
it,
1951,
1953,
some
other
things,
what
have
you?
i
therefore
didn't
exercise
an
independent
discretion
but
i
exercised
my
discretion
by
taking
the
word
of
the
loyalty
review
board,
could
that
be
all
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
(voice
overlap)
--
since
i
could
do
it
as
it
were
arbitrarily,
i
can
let
--
the
loyalty
review
board
have
made
the
findings
for
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
could
do
it
without
giving
any
reason.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can't
give
a
bad
reason
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
about
the
early
cases,
the
elg
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can't
give
a
reason
that's
no
good.
but
if
he
doesn't
give
any
reasons,
then
presumably
he
must
have
acted
on
allowable
reasons.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
he
gave
it,
he
can
give
reasons
that
are
not
sustainable
as
an
exercise
of
reasonable
discretion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
it
have
made
--
would
it
make
a
difference
in
your
view
if
he
had
appointed
his
own
ad
hoc,
an
ad
hoc
board
a
clear
part
to
distinguish
ex-ambassadors
to
advise
them
and
they
had
brought
in
a
report,
a
report
and
he
had
--
had
acted
on
their
report
and
said,
“i
haven't
got
time
to
go
into
this
thing,
indeed
just
like
a
master
in
chancery
and
i
have
doubt
their
report
without
having
read
their
testimony.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
a
different
point,
namely,
that
he
has
the
erected
your
--
your
suggestion
is
that
--
the
point
you're
about
to
urge
is
that
there
was
erected
an
administrative
departmental
procedure
to
which
he
must
be
bound
because
he
enunciated
it
as
such.
he
can't
waive
it
ad
hoc.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
never
have
those
questions
and
have
reached
those
questions
in
the
peters'
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
did
not
reach
those
questions
in
peters.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
were
these
regulations
promulgated
by
the
secretary
of
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
march
11,
1949.
and
how
long
did
they
subsist
as
they
were?
justice
felix
frankfurter
amended
in
matters
that
would
have
made
it
--
made
it
an
important
matter
affecting
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
that
an
issue
there
as
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
okay,
and
let
me
ask
you
this.
such
as
they
were
these
regulations,
is
it
a
matter
of
judicial
knowledge
or
concession
that
--
that
a
number
of
officials
in
the
department
were
a
judge
that
this
was
a
procedure
followed
in
x
number
of
cases?
let
me
also
ask
you
differently.
was
this
the
--
the
procedure
outlined
in
section
3922
(f)
and
it
--
emendation
of
changes,
was
that
the
normal
procedure
in
the
state
department
for
handling
matters
of
this
sort?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
fair
to
say
then
that
this
was
an
ad
hoc
way
of
dealing
with
the
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
that
--
that
the
way
in
which
service
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
out
of
a
current
of
what
was
in
fact
done
in
other
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
regulations
purport
to
deal
with
the
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
now,
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
could
the
secretary
of
state
has
said
that
the
loyalty
board
of
the
civil
service
commission,
not
that
i
do
not
follow
your
conclusion
or
i
think
if
i
overrule
it,
but
you're
in
an
intrusive
body.
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
my
determination.
i
don't
need
his
ultimate
legal
right
but
we
have
a
system
authorized
by
law
for
disposing
of
so-called
loyalty
cases
and
this
is
none
of
your
business.
is
that
--
had
been
within
the
statute
in
the
regulation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rhett,
i
have
--
i
have
been
greatly
puzzled
since
i
heard
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
black.
i'd
never
get
that
as
i
haven't
read
the
brief.
did
i
understand
you
to
say
the
government
contends
that
the
secretary,
although,
on
the
statute
he
had
--
could
exercise
a
discretion
by
--
all
on
his
own?
has
a
power
to
issue
a
scheme
of
a
procedure
or
dealing
with
a
claim
that's
suspicious
on
his
own?
is
that
ultra
vires?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
because
of
the
--
because
there
is
a
--
a
presidential
order
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
this
scheme
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
his
own?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
to
say
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
argument
is
made
and
has
prevailed
that
although
the
secretary
could
fire
out
of
hand,
he
can't
devise
a
system
by
which
he
says,
“i'm
going
to
be
bound
in
the
future,”
that's
ultra
vires.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'll
be
listening
to
the
government
with
great
interest
on
that
claim.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
i
--
did
i
correctly
hear
you
saying
that
he
determined
what
was
and
what
was
not
classified?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
he
determine
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
to
be
sure
i
heard
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
john
smith
today
has
--
has
the
legal
right
to
regard
a
document,
stamp
on
it
or
treat
it
as
classified
or
not
classified,
not
subject
to
restriction
today,
he
can
do
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
i
understood
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
couldn't
the
next
day
say,
“this
is
a
--
announced
these
over
the
radio
and
i'm
not
going
to
be
silly
and
call
this
classified.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
could
not
do
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
it's
all
over
the
world.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
asking
for
a
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
the
word
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
asking
you
to
justify
what
seems
to
me
silly,
if
i
may
say
so,
but
i
just
want
to
know
what
the
fact
is,
whether
he
has
power
ab
initio
to
say,
“this
is
not
a
classifiable
material.”
this
is
not
classified
material,
but
once
having
made
a
decision,
he's
like
the
house
of
laws,
he
can't
change
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
should
think
the
initial
function
of
whether
it
is
or
it
isn't
seems
to
me
at
least
as
--
as
big
a
function
as
to
say
i
was
wrong
yesterday
or
foolish
yesterday.
justice
felix
frankfurter
anyhow,
you're
not
defending
that.
i
just
want
to
know
what
the
fact
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
macguineas,
i
don't
want
to
take
your
time
but
you
surprise
me
a
little
bit.
of
course,
there
must
be
officers
since
the
government
is
in
obstruction.
there
must
be
human
beings
who
are
the
government
who
have
--
technically
speaking,
the
possession
of
classified
material.
but
i
think
a
good
deal
would
have
to
be
said
pro
and
con
whether
classified
materials
can
be
deemed
to
be
the
private
--
the
private
property
of
a
person.
justice
felix
frankfurter
either
while
he's
still
in
the
government
or
after
he
leaves
the
government.
it's
one
of
the
most
troubling
of
problems
in
the
disposition
of
the
confidential
papers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
merely
--
your
answer
to
justice
brennan's
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
not
questioning
as
i
understood
your
answer
to
justice
brennan,
you
are
not
questioning
that
control
over
(a)
set
of
these
documents,
copies
of
these
documents
by
service
unlike
other
documents
that
he
had
was
in
and
of
itself
an
impropriety
of
this
kind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
macguineas,
is
it
relevant
to
the
issues
in
this
case
for
me
to
be
curious
about
the
circumstances
that
led
service
to
have
association,
the
initial
to
have
this
meeting
with
jaffe.
is
it
relevant
to
the
issues
for
me
to
have
that
curiosity
satisfied
or
is
it
irrelevant?
does
it
appear
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
purposes
for
which
in
his
mind,
the
purposes
for
which
if
that's
relevant
and
that's
in
the
record,
then,
i
think
you
ought
to
know
if
it
isn't
--
if
it's
not
in
the
record,
even
though
relevant
and
i
don't
ask
for
the
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
he
didn't
go
and
seek
out
jaffe,
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
wasn't
--
this
wasn't
doing
what
is
--
it
is
to
me
so
shocking,
has
been
for
long,
government
by
leakage.
this
isn't
the
case
where
appellant
sold
out
a
journalist
to
get
some
stuff
into
this
circulation,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
i
mean
this
isn't
the
case
of
an
official
of
a
state
department
and
as
a
basis
under
--
on
the
strength
to
which
he
was
later
dismissed.
this
isn't
a
case
of
an
official
of
the
state
department
having
views
which
he
thinks
is
--
are
important
for
the
public
interest
to
be
out
at
the
--
in
the
stream
of
publicity
in
which
he
sought
out
a
newspaperman
and
gave
it
to
him,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
in
so
far
as
that
nullity
affected
the
determination
of
the
secretary.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can't
--
you
can't
make
a
fact
nullity.
the
legal
counsels
may
be
a
nullity
but
the
fact
may
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
about
dates.
mr.
brooks
atkinson,
his
chief
occupation
is
not
being
a
political
reporter.
when
--
when
did
he
--
he
did
go
to
china
as
reported
from
there.
but
this
jaffe
episode
is
what
the
--
what
he
wants?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
1945.
and
when
was
the
brooks
atkinson
episode?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
follow
that.
i
understand
that,
but
--
but
his
testimony
--
your
argument
is
that
he
was
caught
putting
or
coming
to
jaffe,
but
withdrawing
in
reticent,
vis-à-vis
atkinson.
what
i
want
to
know
is
when
did
atkinson
have
occasioned
to
have
these
conversations
with
--
with
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
peters,
with
service?
was
it
contemporaneous
with
his
indiscretion
of
service
or
was
it
later
by
the
time
when
he
may
have
learned
his
lesson?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
was
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well,
i'm
suggesting
that
the
jaffe
episode
was
1945
and
the
fact
that
he
was
discrete
with
atkinson
in
1948
wouldn't
show
that
he
sought
out
jaffe
as
a
good
fellow
to
leak
to
but
was
held
at
from
atkinson.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suggest
that
that's
vital
in
order
to
draw
any
inference,
discreditable
or
adverse
to
service
that
later
--
that
at
a
later
time,
he
said,
"oh,
no,
i'm
not
even
going
to
give
it
to
so
estimable
on
that
as
mr.
atkinson."
and
if
my
memory
isn't
at
fault,
i
think
atkinson
is
trying
to
ensure
his
labor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
all
that
was
developing
for
the
loyalty
board,
all
for
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
you
must
choose
the
way
you
argue
the
case
of
course.
but
mr.
atkinson
says
within
explicitness
which
i
should
think
carries
weight
in
the
case,
not
only
as
an
ex
secretary
of
state
or
secretary
of
state
for
the
lawyer
with
his
sense
of
relevance.
i
did
not
read
the
testimony
taken
in
the
proceeding
to
mr.
service's
case
before
the
loyalty
review
board
of
the
civil
service
commission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
to
me.
that's
rather
striking.
i
can't
tell,
asking
myself,
why
should
a
lawyer,
let
alone,
the
secretary
of
state
make
such
a
statement
being
a
lawyer
of
mr.
acheson's
understanding
of
what
is
relevant
and
what
isn't
relevant.
a
complete
disavow
that
even
looked
at
his
testimony.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understood
you,
mr.
macguineas,
you
said
there
were
four
ways
of
disposing.
and
then,
on
top
of
that
or
undercutting
at
all,
congress
said
in
your
interpretation
to
the
secretary
of
state,
“you
can
fire
a
fellow
for
any
reason
you
choose.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
was
these
other
four,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right,
but
there
were
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
were
outstanding
four
procedures,
all
of
which,
the
secretary
of
state
could
disregard,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
this
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
therefore,
i
take
it
your
argument
is
that
if
he
wanted
to
fire
service
because
he
--
it's
a
safe
thing
to
do,
a
wise
thing
to
do,
he
could
have
done
it
without
saying
anything.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
as
much
as
there
were
four
--
four
procedures
outstanding,
and
the
secretary
chose
in
fact
to
rely
on
one
of
the
four,
he
wouldn't
be
within
the
framework
of
the
one
he
chose
but
the
government
comes
here
and
they
could
come
here
and
does
come
here
and
say,
“although
he
could
have
chosen
any
of
the
four
and
although
for
purposes
of
the
moment,
he
did
choose
one
of
the
four.
he
could
have
chosen
the
one
that
let
them
free
entirely
on
credits
and
debits
to
be
supported.”
that's
the
argument,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
--
but
--
but
--
what
do
you
say
to
that?could
he
do
that?
could
he
say,
"yes,
i'm
a
free
man.
i'm
unbounded.
i
can
do
what
i
please.
i
choose
not
to
do
what
i
please.
i
choose
to
be
governed
by
a
particular
procedure,"
is
he
then
--
will
he
then
justify
that
procedure?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
therefore
--
but
that
isn't
the
argument
you
made
a
few
minutes
ago.
you
--
your
argument
a
few
minutes
ago,
i
misapprehended
it.
it
was
that
this
special
provision,
one
can
understand
why,
relating
to
the
state
department
authorized
the
secretary
of
state
to
dispense
from
service
without
any
man's
brief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
therefore,
that
being
so,
we
don't
just
look
at
this
other
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
you
have
to
establish
that
he
didn't
purport
to
act
under
some
--
under
one
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
defined
procedures,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
would
--
it
may
be
important
in
this
context?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
they're
dealing
with
in
your
own
words.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
what
he
said,
mr.
macguineas.
if
you
will
read
and
i
still
insist
but
not
only
if
i
have
before
me
an
affidavit
of
the
secretary
of
state
but
one
who
--
one
doesn't
have
to
take
much
judicial
notice,
a
singularly
careful
and
acute
lawyer,
to
use
his
language
with
care.
in
paragraph
4,
he
said,
“acting
in
the
exercise,
i
made
a
determination
to
determining
--
i
made
a
determination
to
terminate."
that's
his
conclusion.
the
next
paragraph
tells
you
the
basis
of
his
conclusion
and
the
basis
of
his
conclusion,
"i
made
that
determination
solely,
solely
as
the
result
of
the
findings
of
loyalty
review
board
and
as
a
result
of
my
review
in
the
opinion
of
that
court."
so,
namely,
that
having
decided,
he
had
his
legislative
authority.
he
had
the
general
security
system,
loyalty
scheme.
one
must
take
oneself
back
to
january
1953.
that
is
a
very
dominant
consideration
in
the
mind
of
everybody
from
the
president,
down.
i
made
a
determination
in
the
light
of
the
--
having
--
having
the
authority
of
loyalty
program
gave
me
and
the
mccarran
act.
i
made
a
determination
of
severance,
but
it
stopped
there.
i
think
we
would
have
one
argument,
but
he
goes
on
and
says,
"i
made
that
determination,
solely
as
a
result
of
the
finding
of
the
loyalty
review
board."
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
fair
to
the
department
to
say
the
department
didn't
prognosticate
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
thought
he
did
evidently
because
--
then
i
come
to
the
other
point,
i
--
i
--
unless
i
have
to.
i
wouldn't
attribute
redundancy
to
any
statement
by
mr.
--
by
mr.
acheson.
i
wouldn't
attribute
to
him
making
half
a
page
to
write
a
lot
of
stuff
that
--
that
is
wholly
irrelevant.
then,
this
--
which
brings
me
to
a
question
on
which
i
would
like
your
candid,
at
least
that
you're
not
candid,
but
you
ought
to
have
no
--
you're
unhesitant
reply.
as
i
listen
to
your
argument,
say,
for
the
last
two
minutes,
it
goes
through
to
my
mind
a
thought
--
i
think
i
would
like
to
have
your
opinion,
perhaps
tomorrow,
but
the
question
of
relevance.
am
i
entitled
to
take
into
account
in
reading
this
paragraph?
am
i
entitled
to
find
light
on
this
paragraph
from
the
fact
that
mr.
acheson
since
fully
unrelated
to
this
case
has
written
a
book
in
which
he
deals
with
the
problem
with
the
loyalty
program.
and
looking
back,
he
finds
that
he,
himself,
now
regrets
his
share
in
carrying
out
that
program
or
his
share
in
supporting
that
program.
if
you
will
tell
me,
i
must
put
that
out
of
my
mind.
i
can
assure
you
why
it's
humanly
possible,
i
shall.
and
i
wish
you'd
be
very
unhesitant
to
tell
me
whether
you
think
that
that's
the
kind
of
thing
that
one
is
puzzled
about
this
thing
has
the
right
to
take
into
account
as
indicating
as
--
as
the
light
in
which
this
is
to
be
read,
as
you
know
what
i'm
referring
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
is
about
last
year.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
this
case.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
you
must
dismiss
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
to
getting
light,
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
want
to
argue
because
i
think
you
would
switch,
but
--
but
i
just
want
to
know
why
that
doesn't
shed
light
as
to
the
significance
in
his
decision
of
a
program
and
the
compulsions
of
a
program
which
he
then
felt
compelled
to
respect
and
indeed
to
promote
which
he
now
regard
as
bad
as
shown
that
--
that
that
did
have
a
hold
on
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
agree
with
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that's
the
way
he
disclosed
his
mind,
but
if
he
disclosed
his
mind
on
a
ground
which
is
not
something
that
he
had
a
right
to
take
in
or
rather
if
--
if
he
discloses
his
mind
of
how
he
acted
on
that,
therefore,
having
operated
within
the
framework
of
the
administrative
procedure
called
the
loyalty
program,
then,
i
hope
before
you
sit
down,
you
indicate
how
that
differs
from
the
elg
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
the
time
that
secretary
hall
denied
that
passport
to
that
swedish
lady,
she
was
swedish,
danish,
whatever.
sorry,
going
on,
mr.
elg.
at
the
time
that
secretary
hall
withheld
a
passport
from
her,
he
could
have
withheld
the
passport
at
that
time.
i
think
the
law
seems
to
be
clear
that
the
secretary
of
state
had
untrammeled
discretion
in
the
matter.
i
don't
mean
to
imply
controversy
and
i
simply
state
what
the
opinion,
what
the
law
then
was.
but
that
isn't
what
secretary
hall
did.
he
gave
a
reason
and
there
was
argued
at
the
bar
of
this
court,
i
think
as
vigorously
and
as
confident
as
your
argue
is.
it's
is
one
of
my
first
arguments,
i
remember,
that
first
arguments
that
i
heard.
that
in
as
much
as
the
secretary
had
absolute
power
for
good
reason,
bad
reason,
no
reason
at
all.
the
fact
that
he
gave
a
reason
that
isn't
any
good
doesn't
limit
his
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
this
pointed
out
the
opposite.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
did
at
that
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
came
if
you
let
me
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
say
so
as
one
who
had
something
to
do
with
it
years
ago.
it
came
to
me
as
a
great
shock
to
find
that
they
could
be
any
question
about
it.
and
that's
why
i'm
saying
the
assumption
of
perkins
against
elg
is
that
the
secretary
has
absolute
power,
except,
he
gave
a
reason
and
this
court
said,
“that
reason
is
no
good.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
that
the
peters
against
hobby
comes
into
this
only
to
the
extent
that
it
vitiates
the
discharge
under
the
executive
order.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
said
--
is
it
quite
that?
may
i
offer
you
another
string
to
your
bow?
it
isn't
--
it
isn't
merely
that
if
he
acted
under
the
loyalty
program,
then
he
acted
under
a
determination,
which
this
court
held
the
board
was
powerless
to
make.
but
at
least
not
to
the
string
to
the
bow
for
you
to
pass,
but
the
--
the
difficulty
here
is
not
nearly
that
he
doesn't
--
he
does
the
hobby
as
he
notified
the
legality
of
that.
but
the
conditions
under
which
the
loyalty
board
as
i
understood
mr.
rhetts'
argument
that
the
circumstances
of
the
--
before
the
loyalty
board
on
the
basis
of
which
they
rendered
their
decision
to
it
and
not
now
needless
to
say
committing
myself
to
it
that
they
acted
on
testimony
which
was
the
demonstrably
or
concededly
inaccurate,
unreliable,
etcetera,
etcetera,
made
a
basis
for
judgment
which
on
the
face
of
it
shows
couldn't
have
been,
if
it
relies
on
--
if
he
parted
to
that
into
account
that
that
is
also
subject
to
--
to
challenge
on
the
general
theory
that
any
abuse
of
discretion
no
matter
how
unlimited
this
subject
to
challenge.
and
that
if
--
that
if
the
secretary
of
state
sets
forth,
i
acted
on
the
testimony
of
absolutely
disreputable
people.
i'm
hoping
to
say
that
this
was
--
i
acted
on
the
testimony
of
actually
disreputable
people,
people
on
whose
testimony
i
wouldn't
dream
of
facing
the
slightest
reliance
on
my
own
affairs
of
light
and
that's
good
enough
for
me.
i'm
not
so
sure
you
would
be
standing
here
and
say,
"that's
an
unreviewable
discretion."
all
discretion
is
subject
to
the
implications
of
a
due
process
clause
even
though
it
may
not
be
a
due
process
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
never
--
have
those
been
cases
in
which
the
exercise
of
discretion
was
challenged
as
based
on
conduct
which
if
it
took
place
in
the
criminal
case,
one
would
say
violated
due
process?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
when
you
say
they've
never
been
considered?
they
may
--
certainly,
perkins
v.elg
was
a
brand
new
decision
so
far
as
anybody
who
is
earning
a
knowledge
of
the
law
was
concerned.
when
you
say
it's
never
been
considered,
one
can
say
it's
never
been
before
this
court
that
the
basis
of
determination
was
something
which
if
conceded
by
the
government
would
in
a
criminal
case
involve
violation
of
due
process.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
agree
with
you
entirely.
i
--
i
for
myself
go
with
you
most
of
the
way,
almost
all
the
way
that
under
30
--
under
103,
the
secretary
of
state
in
just
--
had
this
secretary
tell
mr.
jones
that
his
services
will
terminate
that
afternoon
and
he
is
not
responsible
to
anybody.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
different
question
is
raised
if
he
gives
the
reason.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
please
tell
me
why
you
used
the
word
legally
free?
justice
felix
frankfurter
legally
free
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
in
the
light
of
--
or
the
whole
paragraph.
i
quite
agree
with
my
brother
whittaker.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
--
is
that
--
is
that
what
mr.
rhetts
was
referring
to
when
he
said
as
an
argument
that
the
regulations
are
invalid
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
ultra
vires?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
point,
namely,
that
this
would
be
undercutting
what
congress
has
provided.
