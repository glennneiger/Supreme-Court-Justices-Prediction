mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
may
it
please
the
court.
counsel's
skillful
argument
of
yesterday
invested
petitioner
with
an
aura
of
irreproachability
which
i
think
is
scarcely
warranted
by
the
record.
the
facts
that
were
before
the
secretary
of
state,
when
he
exercised
his
discretion
to
dismiss
the
petitioner
were
these.
his
counsel
indicated,
“when
petitioner
was
on
assignment
with
the
army
as
a
foreign
service
officer
during
the
war
in
china
in
1944,
it
was
his
practice
to
prepare
the
usual
foreign
service
reports.”
the
original
of
which
was
transmitted
to
the
secretary
of
state,
other
copies
went
to
the
army
and
it
was
his
practice
to
retain
one
copy
in
what
he
termed
his
personal
file.
the
petitioner
himself
classified
many
of
those
reports
as
either
confidential
or
secret,
and
that
he
was
authorized
to
do.
a
year
later,
when
petitioner
returned
to
washington,
without
making
any
effort
to
declassify
those
reports,
without
obtaining
any
clearance
from
any
person
in
authority
in
the
secretary
in
the
department
of
state,
he
gave
his
copies
of
the
foreign
service
reports
to
mr.
jaffe.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
yes.
he
had
the
authority
in
the
field
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
--
to
classify
them
on
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
he
--
there
is
no
contention
that
petitioner
had
the
authority
to
declassify
any
of
the
reports.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
yes,
at
that
time
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
--
and
secret.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
that's
right.
he
is
the
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
but
having
that
power
tomorrow
he
can
say,
"looking
away,
i
think
it's
silly."
this
was
in
yesterday's
new
york
times,
why
should
i
keep
this
classified.
is
that
what
i
understood
you
to
say?
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
what
--
what
i
said
was
it
must
be
remembered
that
petitioner
was
operating
in
time
of
war
in
a
field
of
military
operations.
he
at
that
time
was
the
only
one
who
could
append
the
classification
of
those
reports.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
that's
right.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
no,
he
could
not.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
he
could
not
declassify
the
documents
himself.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
that's
--
that
is
correct.
he
did
not
have
the
authority
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
--
of
declassification.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
no,
because
that
function
is
vested
in
higher
authority
in
the
department
of
state.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
but
the
exigencies
of
the
situation
made
it
necessary
that
that
function
be
vested
to
him.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
i
do
not
contend
that
he
did
not
have
the
right.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
i
do
not
believe
that
the
record
explicitly
shows.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
yes.
we
do
not
contest
that.
what
the
point
is
what
he
did
with
them
after
he
got
them
back.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
there
are
many
officers
in
the
government
who
have
the
right
of
possession
of
classified
documents.
but
the
question
is,
to
what
extent
may
that
person
disseminate
those
documents
to
other
persons
to
have
no
right
of
possession
of
classified
documents?
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
i'm
not
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
it
is
not
i
who
is
advancing
the
contention
that
he
had
the
right
to
retain
them.
i
--
that
is
petitioner's
contention.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
yes.
and
i
said
we
do
not
take
issue
with
it
under
these
circumstances.
the
record
does
not
disclose
any
determination
by
the
secretary
of
state
that
he
did
not
have
the
right
to
retain
possession
of
the
copies.
that's
all
i'm
saying.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
i
don't
think
one
can
generalize
about
that.
it
might
depend
upon
the
person.
it
might
depend
upon
the
category
of
the
document.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
that
explicitly
states
whether
petitioner
was
entitled
to
retain
these
copies.
i
think
it
must
be
recognized
that
when
a
man
in
petitioner's
position
is
operating
in
china
in
the
middle
of
the
war
that
--
what
he
does
not
always
proceed
with
strict
formality.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
no,
we
make
no
such
assertion.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
now,
when
petitioner,
upon
his
return
to
the
united
states,
decided
that
he
would
go
to
mr.
jaffe's
hotel
room
at
the
statler,
here
in
washington.
he
had
not
known
jaffe
previously.
and
yet,
on
that
same
day,
it
appears
that
he
made
inquiry
of
a
mutual
acquaintance
of
himself
in
jaffe
as
to
whether
or
not
jaffe
was
a
communist.
and
the
reply
that
he
received
was
not
very
assuring.
the
reply
in
effect
was,
“i
don't
think
he
is
but
he
is
very
sympathetic.”
and
later
on,
petitioner
obviously
had
strong
reservations
about
the
character
of
mr.
jaffe
because
he
asked
another
person
who
was
himself
admittedly
a
former
communist
as
to
whether
jaffe
was
a
communist.
and
this
other
person
replied,
"no,
he
is
not
but
he
is
bad
medicine."
now,
under
those
circumstances,
petitioner
loans
to
jaffe
several
copies
of
his
classified
documents
without
any
further
control
over
them
whatever,
and
jaffe
takes
them
off
to
new
york.
he
does
with
them
as
he
pleases,
and
a
week
or
so
later,
petitioner
meets
with
jaffe
in
new
york
and
recovers
possession
of
the
reports.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
i
think
that
counsel
made
a
fair
statement
yesterday
of
the
background
which
led
up
to
petitioner
becoming
introduced
to
jaffe,
and
i
take
no
exception
to
what
he
said
as
to
that.
i'm
merely
pointing
out
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
no.
he
did
not
--
he
did
not.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
the
leakage
--
there
was
a
leakage
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
petitioner
did
not
take
the
initiative
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
--
in
meeting
jaffe.
well,
i
--
i'm
really
pointing
out
that
those
were
facts
which
were
before
the
secretary
of
state
when
he
formed
his
judgment
as
to
whether
or
not
petitioner
should
be
retained
as
a
foreign
service
officer.
now,
i'm
not
sure
whether
it
was
made
plain
from
the
argument
yesterday,
that
in
so
far
as
the
secretary
of
state
exercised
his
purported
authority
to
dismiss
jaffe
under
the
loyalty
program,
that
is
executive
order
no.9835.
the
petitioner
has
already
received
the
relief
to
which
he
was
entitled.
when
this
case
was
heard
in
the
district
court,
this
court's
opinion
in
peters
v.hobby
had
just
come
down.
that
of
course
established
that
the
handling
of
this
case
by
the
loyalty
review
board
in
the
civil
service
commission
was
beyond
its
jurisdiction.
and
the
district
court
recognized
that
and
he
said
that
“the
opinion
of
the
review
board
is
a
nullity
and
i
will
order
the
civil
service
commission
to
expunge
the
opinion
from
the
record,'
which
is
precisely
the
relief
which
this
court
granted
in
peters
versus
hobby.
so,
to
us,
petitioner's
present
contention
and
i
may
say
that
that
relief
was
granted
without
objection
on
the
part
of
the
government.
petitioner's
present
contention
as
to
the
adequacy
or
the
vise
of
the
proceedings
before
the
loyalty
review
board
as
an
exercise
of
purported
authority
under
9835
is
simply
bidding
a
dead
horse
that's
not
in
this
case.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
yes.
now,
that's
the
next
thing.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
that's
precisely
my
point
of
view
which
i
hope
to
develop
in
a
moment.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
most
of
these
facts
were
developed
at
the
hearings
before
the
state
department
board
and
the
conclusion
of
the
state
department
board
was
this.
they
said,
“petitioner
has
been
guilty
of
serious
indiscretions
in
giving
these
classified
reports
to
jaffe
without
making
a
proper
investigation
of
his
character.
and
furthermore,
petitioner
has
been
guilty
of
a
breach
of
the
department's
regulations.”
“but,”
said
the
state
department
board,
“in
our
opinion,
he
has
now
learned
his
lesson.
and
therefore,
will
not
in
the
future
be
a
security
risk.
and
therefore,
we
recommend
that
the
secretary
not
find
that
he
be
a
security
risk.”
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
that
--
that
is
the
--
that
is
the
only
finding
as
to
the
less
proceeding.
the
--
the
record
does
not
disclose
that
the
--
that
the
state
department
board
wrote
any
opinion
or
made
specific
finds
as
to
the
prior
investigations.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
no.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
no,
because
there
was
no
elaborate
hearing
on
this
last
investigation
before
the
state
department
board
at
which
petitioner
testified
at
great
length
and
other
people
testified.
and
i
may
say
that
the
secretary
has
before
him
one
other
fact
and
that
was
the
curious
contrast
between
petitioner's
dealings
with
jaffe
and
his
dealings
with
brooks
atkinson
who
is
a
reporter
of
the
new
york
times.
mr.
atkinson
testified
before
the
state
department
board
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner
and
he
said
in
effect,
“i
have
always
found
petitioner
exceedingly
stroked
of
us
about
not
giving
out
confidential
material.
he
has
always
refused
to
let
me
see
any
classified
material.”
and
yet,
by
contrast,
when
petitioner
is
dealing
with
jaffe,
a
man
whose
reputation
was
doubtfully
in
his
own
mind,
he
did
not
have
any
such
reservations
or
scruple.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
the
jaffe
episode
is
in
1945.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
brooks
atkinson
testified
thereafter
at
the
hearing
before
the
state
department
board
in
1950
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
no.
they
would
have
had
to,
have
been
earlier
because
atkinson
gave
this
testimony
before
the
state
department
board
had
made
its
ruling
in
the
case.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
that
was
in
1950.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
i
--
i
appreciate
your
honor's
point
now.
well,
as
far
as
the
material
that
was
before
the
secretary
of
state
when
he
made
his
decision,
the
opinion
of
the
review
board
does
not
state
the
time
or
times
at
which
atkinson
had
communication
with
petitioner.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
i
confess
that
i
have
no
personal
knowledge
of
that.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
oh,
no,
no.
his
general
course
of
--
of
dealing
with
petitioner
as
a
foreign
service
officer
in
one
hand
and
atkinson
at
new
york
times
reporter
on
the
other.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
no
indication
that
he
was
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
service
in
his
testimony
expressed
his
opinion
that
the
material
that
was
contained
in
these
reports
was
such,
as
he
might
legitimately
give
by
way
of
background
information
to
members
of
the
press.
but
petitioner
did
not
contend
that
he
had
under
the
state
department's
regulations,
any
authority
to
actually
turn
over
these
testified
documents
to
jaffe
or
anybody
else.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
no.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
no,
i'm
sorry.
i
did
not
mean
to
say
that
he
thought
he
could
turn
the
papers
over
to
the
press.
he
could
convey
to
the
press
as
background
information,
the
substance
of
the
material
that
was
stated
in
his
reports.
but
that
is
of
course
a
different
matter
from
having
authority
to
turn
over
the
classified
document
itself.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
no.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
a
man
who
--
also,
the
government
who
has
some
authority
to
give
information
to
the
press
may
under
some
circumstances
be
authorized
to
discuss
with
appropriate
discretion
and
rephrasing
the
substance
of
matters
that
may
be
contained
in
classified
documents,
but
that
is
by
no
means
the
same
as
turning
over
the
classified
document
itself
and
say,
"here
it
is."
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
yes,
because
the
person
who
was
given
that
authority
is
assumed
to
have
the
discretion
that
he
can
convey
communications
about
that
subject
matter
by
way
of
paraphrase
or
in
such
of
a
way.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
i
would
think
that
if
he
--
if
he
literally
read
the
report
to
the
man
that
that
would
be
a
breach
of
security
regulations.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
it
all
depends.
a
paraphrase
is
not
precisely
the
same
thing
by
definition.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
yes.
but
--
but
the
way
the
thing
is
presented,
the
sources
of
the
information,
all
of
those
things
may
be
relevant
which
cannot
be
revealed
without
breaching
security.
and
yet,
the
essence
of
the
matter
maybe
able
to
be
presented
in
a
way
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
--
which
does
not
breach
security.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
that
may
well
be
solved,
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
because
when
service
was
in
china,
which
was
of
course
chungking
in
1944
was
a
very
different
atmosphere
from
washington,
d.c.in
1945.
he
was
on
his
own
so
to
speak.
he
was
the
political
advisor
of
general
stilwell
in
china.
as
such,
service
considered
that
he
have
the
right
within
proper
limits
of
security
to
discuss
with
the
press
the
chinese
situation.
and
he
considered,
so
he
testified
at
least
that
he
has
that
right
to
carry
that
over
into
washington
when
he
was
back
here
and
that
what
he
did
to
jaffe
fell
within
what
he
considered
that
right.
although,
i
say
i
--
i
do
not
consider
that
anything
at
the
record
that
supports
the
view
that
even
petitioner
considered
that
he
have
the
right
to
turn
over
the
physical
classified
documents
to
anybody.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
this
--
this
was
developed
initially
before
the
state
department
board,
and
then
in
supplementary
fashion,
before
the
loyalty
review
board
which
held
its
own
hearing.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
true.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
that
leads
us
into
what
we
consider
the
real
issue
in
the
case.
and
if
i
may,
by
way
of
introduction,
give
the
legal
situation
as
it
existed
at
the
time
that
mr.
acheson
made
his
determination.
at
that
time,
there
were
four
statutes
and
one
executive
order,
which
gave
government
employees
a
different
classes,
certain
procedural
protections
with
respect
to
their
removal.
there
was,
of
course,
the
civil
service
act
which
covered
employees
in
the
classified
civil
service
who
might
be
removed
to
promote
the
efficiency
of
the
service.
there
was
the
veterans'
preference
act,
which
gave
similar
protection
to
veterans
in
the
service.
there
was
the
foreign
service
act,
which
gave
foreign
service
officers
such
as
petitioner,
a
procedural
protection
of
not
being
dismissed
except
pursuant
to
a
hearing
before
a
board
of
foreign
service
officers.
there
was,
in
addition,
the
act
of
august
26,
1950,
which
this
court
construed
in
cole
versus
young
which
authorized
a
dismissal
in
accordance
with
prescribed
procedure
of
any
employee
in
the
interest
of
the
national
security.
and
finally,
there
was
executive
order
no.9835
as
amended
which
prescribed
procedure
for
the
handling
of
cases
of
doubtful
loyalty.
now,
with
all
those
procedures
report,
congress,
in
the
appropriations
act
for
the
state
department
gave
to
the
secretary
of
state
in
these
words,
“the
absolute
discretion
not
withstanding
the
provisions
of
any
other
law
to
dismiss
any
officer
or
employee
of
the
department
of
state
whenever
he
might
deem
not
necessary
or
advisable
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states.”
now,
to
us,
congress
by
that
simply
wiped
out
all
the
law
with
respect
to
procedural
protection
in
the
dismissal
of
employees
in
the
department
of
state.
it
left
those
employees,
strictly
employees
at
will
at
the
pleasure,
if
you
please,
of
the
secretary
of
state.
now,
that
of
course
is
not
really
so
remarkable.
for
a
hundred
years
in
our
government,
essentially,
all
employees
in
the
executive
branch
held
tenure
or
rather
lack
of
tenure
solely
at
the
pleasure
of
the
superior
officer,
the
president
or
the
officers
under
him.
and
indeed,
today,
the
highest
level
of
officials
in
the
executive
branch,
hold
office
solely
at
the
will,
solely
at
the
pleasure
of
the
president.
by
this
statute,
as
we
see
it,
the
relationship
which
obtained
between
foreign
service
officers
and
the
secretary
of
state
was
exactly
as
that
which
obtains
between
the
president
and
the
secretary
of
state
himself.
in
other
words,
the
president
at
any
time
is
free
to
say
to
the
secretary
of
state,
"you're
doing
a
fine
job
but
you
don't
get
along
with
the
press
or
you
don't
get
along
with
appropriations
committee,
so
you've
got
to
go,"
and
that's
it,
no
notice,
no
charges,
no
proceeding.
and
by
this
statute,
the
foreign
service
officers
were
placed
in
exactly
that
situation.
so
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
the
--
the
president's
right
to
do
that
is
derived
from
the
--
his
constitutional
duty
to
execute
the
laws
and
implied
in
that,
of
course,
is
that
if
he
is
to
execute
the
laws,
he
must
have
complete
control
over
the
executive
personnel
whom
he
needs
to
discharge
that
function.
and
hence,
except
as
congress
may
otherwise
validly
provide
with
respect
to
inferior
officers
of
the
government,
all
the
executive
officers
and
employees
hold
their
position
solely
at
the
pleasure
of
their
superior
officer.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
yes,
yes.
in
other
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
i
--
i
find
it
hard
to
conceive
of
a
case
which
could
turn
on
--
on
a
distinction
between
those
two
words.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
no
question
about
his
authority
to
do
that
in
my
opinion.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
absolutely.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
absolute
means
absolute
and
for
a
hundred
years
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
the
--
the
point
is
that
congress
said,
"we're
leaving
it
to
you,
mr.
secretary
and
nobody
else
could
decide
what's
the
right
thing
to
do.
we
want
you
to
make
that
decision
and
we
want
that
to
be
made
not
subject
to
review
by
any
other
organ
of
government."
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
exactly.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
yes,
but
at
the
same
time,
congress
said,
“notwithstanding
the
provisions
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
--
of
any
other
law.”
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
under
this
statute,
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
no
question
about
that.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
but
that's
not
what
the
secretary
did.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
but
that's
not
what
he
did
in
this
case.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
that's
not
what
he
did
in
this
case.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
right
so.
now
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
as
long
as
he
exercises
his
authority
under
that
statute.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
and
you're
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
no.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
pardon
me.
what
i
have
to
establish
and
what
this
record
makes
perfectly
plain
is
that
he
acted
and
specifically
stated
that
he
acted
under
two
authorities,
each
independent.
one
was
the
loyalty
order,
but
quite
independently
of
that,
the
secretary
said,
"i
exercise
my
discretion
under
the
absolute
discretion
statute."
he
didn't
use
those
words
but
he
referred
to
the
statute
by
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
he
said
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
that's
right.
what
he
said
was,
"i
understood
that
the
responsibility
was
vested
in
me
to
make
the
determination,
both
under
executive
order
9835
and
under
section
103
of
public
law
188,”
and
that
section
was
the
part
of
absolute
discretion
statute.
and
then,
in
the
next
paragraph,
"acting
in
the
exercise
of
the
authority
vested
in
me
by
executive
order
9835
and
also
by
section
103,
i
made
a
determination
to
terminate
it."
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
that's
right.
there's
no
such
statutory
limitation
on
the
president's
discretion.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
that's
right.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
if
one
could
conceive
of
a
case
where
the
secretary
of
state
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
i
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
no,
it's
right.
there
is
that
qualification.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
the
secretary
must
decide
in
his
absolute
discretion
that
it
is
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states
to
dismiss
petitioner.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
i
say
it
is.
i
concede
it
is
subject
to
that
one
qualification.
so,
the
only
question
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
but
the
only
question
then
in
this
case
is
did
the
secretary
make
that
determination?
we
think
in
his
affidavit
plainly
establishes
that
he
did
make
the
determination
to
exercise
his
authority
under
the
absolute
discretion
statute.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
now,
what
the
secretary
of
state
seems
to
me
plain
enough
to
be
saying
there
is
this,
"i
exercise
my
statutory
discretion.
the
only
datum,
the
only
fact
which
i
had
before
me
which
caused
me
to
exercise
that
discretion
was
the
opinion
of
the
loyalty
review
board."
in
other
words,
he
said,
"the
only
thing
i
looked
at
when
i
made
up
my
mind
was
to
read
the
opinion
of
the
loyalty
review
board."
now,
that
brings
us
to
the
heart
of
the
petitioner's
case.
concededly,
the
opinion
of
the
loyalty
review
board
in
it
and
of
itself
was
not
an
act
of
government.
it
did
not
establish
any
legal
rights
or
obligations,
either
the
petitioner
or
the
government.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
that
was
decided
by
this
court
after
the
secretary
acted.
when
the
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
yes.
now,
what
the
secretary
himself
actually
knew
about
that
situation,
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out,
this
was
a
secretary
who
is
an
exceptionally
acute
liar.
what
he
actually
knew
about
that
situation
is
not
disclosed
by
the
record.
our
contention
in
that
is
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
i
--
i
think
there
are
some
lawyers
who
consider
they
can
prognosticate
this
court's
opinions.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
no,
i
say
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
i
say
the
record
is
--
the
record
is
blank
on
that
subject.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
as
quite
fair
--
quite
fair.
but
then,
the
point
comes
down
to
this.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
i
think
it
may
or
it
may
also
be
what
the
secretary
of
state
may
have
had
in
mind
was
this.
he
may
have
said
well,
the
board
has
made
this
decision
of
the
doubtful
loyalty.
he
said,
i
don't
--
i
don't
agree
with
the
board.
but
nevertheless,
that
is
a
decision
of
a
board
which
goes
to
the
press.
it
affects
the
relations
of
the
department
of
state
with
congress
and
with
the
public
and
i
deem
within
the
interest
of
the
united
states
in
the
light
of
that
fair
fact
that
the
--
such
an
opinion
has
been
issued
that
mr.
service
be
dispensed.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
no,
i
don't
think
so
at
all
because
as
i
say,
he
--
he
might
have
said,
i
think
this
opinion
is
completely
wrong
as
far
as
what
it
says
about
mr.
service's
doubtful
loyalty.
but
nevertheless,
it
is
one
of
the
facts
of
light
that
this
opinion
has
been
issued
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
--
and
the
law
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
no,
i
suggest
that
assumes
that
the
secretary
of
state
in
making
this
kind
of
an
absolute
discretion
determination
has
to
act
upon
something
that
has
legal
significance
or
legal
effect.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
quite
candidly,
i'll
state
to
your
honor
that
whatever
mr.
acheson's
present
views
maybe
about
the
loyalty
program
or
his
part
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
no,
no,
the
whole
program
and
his
participation
in
it
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
this
case.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
but
because
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
because
it's
quite
irrelevant
because
he
may
say
in
effect,
"i'm
sorry
i
did
it,"
but
that's
not
saying
that
he
didn't
have
the
authority
to
do
it
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
--
and
that
what
he
did
was
not
legal.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
our
point
is
and
as
far
as
the
judging
the
validity
of
the
exercise
of
this
discretion,
it
doesn't
make
a
slightest
difference
whether
the
datum
on
which
he
relied
was
an
opinion
by
a
board,
whether
it
was
a
newspaper
editorial,
whether
it
was
a
letter
from
the
congressman,
whether
it
was
a
causal
conversation
from
a
friend.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
that's
right.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
i
must
take
to
your
honor's
statement
that
he
made
a
decision
on
something
they
didn't
have
a
right
to
take
in.
that's
just
my
point.
he
did
have
the
right
to
look
at
this
opinion
whether
it
was
legal
or
illegal.
he
had
the
right
for
instance.
suppose
he
had
said,
"i
make
this
decision
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
court
case
in
jones
versus
smith.”
and
subsequently,
it
turns
out
that
the
decision
in
jones
versus
smith
was
rendered
by
a
court
without
jurisdiction.
would
that
vitiate
the
secretary's
exercise
of
absolute
discretion?
i
say
no.
"absolute
discretion"
means
jurisdiction
to
decide
rightly
or
wrongly.
it
means
jurisdiction
to
decide
without
subject
to
review
by
any
other
organ
of
government
and
that
is
plainly
what
congress
meant,
would
emphatically
used
the
word
"absolute
discretion."
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
but
the
point
is
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
that's
right.
now,
the
distinction
between
this
situation
and
the
perkins
v.elg
situation
is
this,
as
i
see
it.
the
passport
statute
does
not
give
the
secretary
of
state
absolute
discretion.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
no.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
we
--
the
government
may
have
so
argued
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
--
but
if
so,
the
government
was
mistaken.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
and
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
what
--
what
this
court
conclusively
established
as
an
interpretation
of
the
passport
statute
in
perkins
v.elg
is
that
the
secretary
of
state's
discretion
is
not
untrammeled,
that
it
is
subject
to
judicial
review
with
respect
to
issues
of
law.
now,
here
--
and
then,
may
i
say
otherwise,
you
are
not
dealing
there
with
problems
so
internal
to
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
as
the
tenure
of
executive
personnel.
you
were
dealing
with
the
rights
of
private
citizens
who
have
no
employment
relationship
with
the
government.
and
that
right
as
established
by
this
court
in
perkins
v.elg
has
about
it
elements
of
justiciability
which
the
right
or
privilege
of
executive's
tenure
does
not
have.
now,
even
in
the
case
of
a
dismissal
under
the
civil
service
law
where
the
phrase
is,
“in
order
to
promote
the
efficiency
of
the
service,”
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
the
discretion
on
the
executive
as
to
the
reason
for
dismissing
the
man,
also
the
evidence
or
the
data
on
which
he
does
it
is
a
matter
of
unreviewable
executive
discretion.
this
court
will
review
for
compliance
with
prescribed
procedure
and
that
only.
the
most
striking
case
to
illustrate
that
is
the
ever
lying
case
in
257
u.s.,
where
a
man
was
dismissed
form
the
civil
service
for
taking
bribes.
subsequently,
a
reinvestigation
was
held
and
the
president
himself
decided
that
those
charges
were
wholly
unfounded.
the
man
was
innocent
and
he
was
reinstated.
he
then
sued
in
the
court
of
claims
for
his
back
pay
during
the
period
that
he
was
out
of
a
job
and
the
claim
that
came
here
on
appeal
of
this
court.
the
question
was
whether
this
court
could
take
into
account
the
admitted
error
in
the
initial
or
executive
determination
that
the
man
was
not
guilty
of
the
things
for
which
he
was
dismissed,
and
this
court
said,
"no.
we
can't
consider
that.
that
is
wholly
within
the
discretion
of
the
executive."
he
got
the
procedure,
which
the
law
gave
him
to
it
and
as
far
as
the
courts
are
concerned,
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
yes,
because
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
exactly.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
precisely.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
precisely.
now,
that
presents
our
position
with
respect
to
the
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
but
in
this
field
of
executive
employment,
i
do
stand
here
and
say
exactly
that,
and
i
say
it
because
it's
what
this
court
has
held
time
and
time
again.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
certainly,
traditional
concepts
of
due
process
have
never
been
considered
applicable
to
executive
dismissal.
under
the
civil
service
law,
the
employee
doesn't
even
get
any
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
all
i'm
pointing
out
is
that
in
the
civil
service
dismissal,
the
employee
doesn't
even
get
a
hearing
in
the
most
rudimentary
sense
of
the
term.
and
yet,
no
one
has
ever
contend
that
--
that
there
is
any
due
process
question
involved
in
that,
the
employee
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
exactly.
now,
what
the
secretary
is
saying
there
is,
"i
recognize
that
this
opinion
of
the
loyalty
review
board
had
no
more
force
than
a
newspaper
article.
i
was
free
to
accept
it
or
reject
it.
i
chose
to
look
at
that
and
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
what
he
meant
was
that
he
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
what
he
meant
was
that
he
was
not
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
what
he
meant
was
that
he
was
not
taken
in
by
the
general
memorandum
which
the
loyalty
review
board
had
issued
to
all
agencies
in
which
they
said,
“the
head
of
the
agencies
must
carry
out
our
mandate.”
and
he,
as
you
say,
wasn't
a
student
of
--
a
lawyer
to
appreciate
that
that
was
not
the
law.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
no,
our
position,
which
i
can
only
state
in
summary
fashion
on
the
regulations
argument,
is
this.
first,
those
regulations
by
their
own
terms
are
dealing
with
terminations
on
these
grounds
either
of
loyalty
or
security.
this
was
not
a
termination
of
petitioner,
either
for
loyalty
or
security
ground.
this
was
a
pure
termination
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
because
that's
the
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
and
that's
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
what
is
said
in
the
notice
is
that
the
secretary
exercised
his
authority
under
the
statute
citing
it
which
says,
"terminate
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states."
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
yes,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
he
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
no,
no.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
that
doesn't
mean
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
it
had
none
--
none
but
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
yes,
but
that
didn't
mean
to
say
that
he
accepted
their
conclusion
that
he
was
loyal.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
because
he
was
discharged
under
the
statute,
and
the
statute
under
which
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
but
not
that
the
secretary
concluded
that
this
man
was
disloyal
merely
because
he
read
an
opinion.
he
may
have
disagreed
with
everything
in
that
opinion
and
still
said
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
he
said,
“no.”
you
can
say
that
he
said,
“yes.”
the
only
thing
i
looked
at
was
this
opinion.
now,
the
second
point
on
the
regulation
is
that
even
if
you
are
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
i'm
sorry.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
no,
doubt
about
that
but
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
the
difference
is
what
i
thought
i
had
previously
indicated.
the
secretary
may
have
looked
at
this
report
and
he
said,
"i
don't
believe
a
word
in
this
report,
but
it's
the
only
thing
i'm
going
to
look
at.
but
nevertheless,
the
pubic
relations
at
the
time
indicate
that
it's
desirable
to
dismiss
the
secretary."
now,
that's
not
a
dismissal
on
loyalty
grounds,
to
security
grounds.
it's
merely
a
dismissal
because
the
secretary
conceded
to
be
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states
under
all
the
circumstances
to
dismiss
the
man.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
that
was
--
the
secretary
told
him.
he
said,
"i
am
discharging
you,
both
under
the
loyalty
ground
and
under
the
absolute
discretion
statute."
now,
the
second
point,
if
i
may
proceed
on
the
regulation
point
is
that
even
if
contrary
to
our
contention,
the
court
treats
those
regulations
as
applicable
to
an
exercise
of
absolute
discretion
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states.
those
regulations
were
complied
with.
i
--i
regret
that
the
time
does
not
permit
but
the
details
of
that
are
set
forth
in
our
brief.
the
final
and
last
point
is
the
one
which
was
not
raised
by
the
government's
result,
was
advanced
only
by
the
courts
and
the
suggestion
that
congress
passing
this
statute
in
the
circumstances
that
existed
at
the
time,
was
all
these
procedural
laws
in
effect
intended
that
this
discretion
be
exercised
without
any
procedure,
whatever.
and
that
therefore,
if
the
secretary
under
that
statute
turns
right
around
and
proscribed
the
same
procedure
that
he
had
already
he's
merely
nullifying
the
course
of
the
statute.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
we
--
we
--
yes.
we
--
we
state
that
as
a
--
a
ground
because
it
was
stated
by
the
courts
below.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
we
--
no.
we
have
no
grounds
except
as
stated
by
the
court.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
exactly.
