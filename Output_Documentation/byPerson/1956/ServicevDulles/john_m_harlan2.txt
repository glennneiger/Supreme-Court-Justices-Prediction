what
page
on
your
brief
issued
that
correction?
go
on
just
see.
was
it
--
well,
don't
bother
if
you
haven't
got
the
page.
justice
john
m.
harlan
okay.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
you're
saying,
if
i
understand
it
is
insofar
as
the
exercise
of
the
103
power
is
concerned,
it's
immaterial
whether
that
peters
against
hobby
is
immaterial,
that's
your
point,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
if
peters
against
hobby
had
come
down
the
day
before
acheson
exercised
his
103
power,
you
would
say
that
notwithstanding
peters
against
hobby,
he
had
a
right
to
take
into
account
that
de
facto
action,
if
he
choose
to
call
it
of
the
loyalty
review
board
which
the
court
held
is
without
jurisdiction
to
act
and
could
make
that
a
basis
of
his
103
power
discharge,
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
your
position?
justice
john
m.
harlan
assuming
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
you
--
could
you
take
the
two
minutes
that's
remaining
to
deal
what
seems
to
me
to
be
the
real
trouble
in
this
case.
and
that
is,
how
can
you
justify
the
departure
from
the
regulations
assuming
that
the
regulations
were
applicable
to
the
103
--
the
103
power?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
you've
answered
that
because
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
what
he
said
in
his
affidavit
in
effect
is
that
had
it
not
been
--
put
it
in
another
way,
had
it
not
been
for
the
loyalty
review
report,
the
board's
report,
this
fellow
wouldn't
have
been
discharged.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
what's
the
difference
between
that
in
substance,
the
real
substance
of
discharging
him
for
loyalty
reasons?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
said
that
the
government
didn't
raise
that
point.
do
you
support
--
do
you
undertake
to
support
that
reasoning?
justice
john
m.
harlan
by
the
court
of
appeals.
you
don't
make
any
independent
argument
in
support
of
it?
