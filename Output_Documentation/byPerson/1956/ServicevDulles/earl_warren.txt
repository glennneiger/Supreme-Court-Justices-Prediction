john

petitioner,
versus
john

dulles,
et

mr.
macguineas,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
while
you're
on
that
subject,
would
you
mind
stating
whether
he
has
the
right
to
declassify
as
well
as
classify
or
is
there
a
procedure
for
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
it
a
classification
for
him
to
say
confidential?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
he
has
no
authority
beyond
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
may
i
ask
this?
does
the
government
recognize
or
--
or
is
it
a
fact
that
a
man
--
a
man
can
keep
copies
of
classified
material,
not
only
the
--
the
confidential
documents
but
those
that
are
--
that
are
of
higher
grades
and
classification.
can
he
keep
a
copy
for
--
for
himself
under
your
regulations?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
--
what
is
there
to
determine,
what
he
can
keep
and
what
he
can't
keep?
is
there
any
rule
on
it
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
not
--
without
regard
to
whether
they
were
marked
confidential
or
--
or
secret.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
may
i
ask
one
more
--
one
more
question.
were
these
facts
concerning
with
conduct
of
--
of
the
petitioner
that
you
have
outlined
known
to
the
department
at
the
time
that
he
was
cleared
on
these
successive
occasions?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that's
the
sum
in
substance
of
the
--
of
their
findings
on
each
of
the
occasions
when
they
found
him
not
to
be
a
security
risk.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
facts
were
before
them
though.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say
in
connection.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
does
the
--
does
the
constitution
or
any
statute
say
that
the
president
has
the
discretion
to
do
that
or
that
he
has
the
power
to
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
to
do
you
read
the
words
"absolute
discretion"
as
being
synonymous
with
absolute
power?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
make
no
distinction
at
all
between
the
two?
chief
justice
earl
warren
perhaps
suppose
the
--
suppose
in
this
case,
the
--
the
secretary
of
state
said
that
instead
of
saying
what
he
did,
"i
--
i
relieve
this
man
from
--
from
duty
because
he's
a
republican."
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
could
do
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
of
the
words,
"absolute
discretion?"
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
for
either
use,
any
other
thing
--
any
other
thing
that
he
wanted
whether
it
was
--
was
right,
whether
it
was
wholesome
or
whether
or
not?
