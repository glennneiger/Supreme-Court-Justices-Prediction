you
--
your
position
on
phillips,
as
i
understand
it,
ms.
margolin,
is
its
physical
separateness.
that's
all
it's
about.
justice
john
m.
harlan
functional
aspect
of
it
has
no
bearing,
at
least
no
adverse
bearing
to
your
position
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
that
if
the
division
here
or
what
you
call
the
division,
it
had
to
get
a
large
office
building
where
it
could
carry
on
all
its
functions
physically
it
would
not
be
within
the
act
but
it
would
have
to
because
of
locality
it
went
five
separate
buildings,
that
you
can
look
at
each
one
separately?
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
isn't
a
chain
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
isn't
a
chain
organization.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
isn't.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
any
claim
that
the
business
from
a
bookkeeping
standpoint
was
allocated
among
these
various
houses
--
various
warehouses
in
order
to
bring
them
within
or
without
the
exemption
of
the
act.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice

justice
john
m.
harlan
without
regard
to
the
interstate
aspect
of
this
problem,
what
is
the
difference
between
the
character
of
the
business
carried
on
in
this
alameda
warehouse
as
against
that
carried
on
in
the
other
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
being
non-retail?
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
you
store
it
for
a
commercial
outfit,
it's
non-retail.
if
you
store
it
for
a
household
there
is
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
in
my
point
of
view
if
i
am
correct
in
this
understanding
under
your
view
of
the
exempts,
do
you
agree
that
a
separate
business
establishment
is
something
more
than
a
separate
building?
in
other
words,
it
does
treat
a
building
which
is
a
business
establishment.
the
physical
structure
is
not
enough.
justice
john
m.
harlan
place
of
business?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
this
outfit,
this
alameda
outfit
was
not
run
on
that
fashion
at
all.
it
was
run
as
a
--
a
physical
--
separate
physical
part
that
is
part
of
a
single
business
run
by
this
division
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
wasn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
--
this
is
a
physical
building,
except
that
physically
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
that's
why
it's
a
fact.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
court
of
appeals
here
didn't
hold
that
the
exemption
ever
applied
to
multiple
units
it
just
said
that
on
the
facts
here
we
don't
find
this
as
a
separate
business
establishment.
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
is
the
portion
of
the
stipulation
that
you
referred
to,
mr.
smith?
justice
john
m.
harlan
thank
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
any
difference
in
the
charge
with
the
customer
depending
upon
the
relationship
that
this
basic
business
to
the
particular
warehouse
which
you
storage
had
been?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
if
you
have
to
treat
them
as
a
--
the
--the
division
as
a
unit
while
your
argument
breaks
down,
isn't
it?
what
you
admit
there
exempt
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
the
small
corner
of
grocery
store
argument
doesn't
add
anything
to
your
position.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
you
give
me
the
page
of
the
brief
that
imposes
determination
in
your
brief?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
just
on
the
face
of
it,
it
says
in
the
ordinary
case.
it
doesn't
say
ithis
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
without
exemption
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
still,
if
you
want
unless
to
interpret
it,
it
at
least
be
rather
flexible,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
on
the
reverse
side
of
that,
the
court
of
appeals
here
shouldn't
or
hasn't
held
that
no
case
can
a
--
or
in
every
case
there's
a
multiple
unit
you
regard
as
a
single
unit.
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
simply
--
this
is
a
question
of
facts.
