ms.
bessie
margolin
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
fair
labor
standards
act
case
instituted
by
the
secretary
of
labor
to
enjoin
violations
of
the
overtime
and
record
keeping
provisions
of
the
act.
the
issue
presented
is
a
fairly
simple
one
but
highly
important
because
upon
it
depends
the
application
of
three
exemptions
from
the
provisions
of
this
act,
and
exemptions
which
are
from
both
the
minimum
wage
and
the
overtime
requirements
of
the
act.
i
refer
to
the
exemptions
relating
to
the
retail
or
service
establishment,
retail
or
service
establishments
of
which
there
are
three
related
exemptions.
the
particular
exemption
involved
here
is
the
one
in
section
13
(a)
(2)
which
is
--
has
been
in
the
act
since
its
original
enactment.
a
new
--
two
new
exemptions
were
added
in
1949
which
also
turn
on
the
same
key
term
which
is
retail
or
service
establishment.
the
establishment
--
retail
or
service
establishment
exemption
is
for
retail
or
service
establishment
whose
sales
of
goods
or
services
are
local
or
intrastate
and
are
retail
in
nature
in
certain
prescribed
degrees.
that
is
more
than
50%
intrastate
and
at
least
75%
retail.
the
key
term
in
these
exemptions
is
the
word
establishment
which,
of
course,
must
be
identified
before
the
percentage
tests
and
the
other
conditions
of
these
exemptions
can
be
applied.
the
sole
issue
in
this
case
is
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
term
establishment
as
used
in
these
exemptions?
this
is
not
an
--
a
novel
an
issue.
we
believe
that
it
was
settled
by
this
court
12
years
ago
in
the
decision
of
phillips
company
v.
walling.
and
until
the
decision
--
the
decisions
below
in
the
instant
case
it
was
generally
assumed
that
at
least
this
aspect
of
this
--
of
these
exemptions
and
of
section
13
(a)
(2)
which
has
other
complicated
features
about
it,
but
that
at
least
this
basic
aspect
that
has
been
assumed
was
settled
12
years
ago
and
assumed
not
merely
by
--
by
the
administrative
officials
but
by
the
court
and
by
congress
in
1949
when
it
amended
this
section
in
certain
respects.
the
phillips
case,
if
i
might
just
remind
the
court
before
giving
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
--
of
the
facts
of
the
phillips
case,
that
case
involved
a
chain
of
retail
grocery
stores
in
new
england.
there
were
49
separate
retail
grocery
stores
and
a
central
warehouse
and
office.
and
this
court,
after
a
very
thorough
analysis
of
this
exemption
and
its
intent
and
purpose,
ruled
that
the
term
establishment
refer
to
each
physically
distinct
unit
or
place
of
business
and
not
to
the
business
enterprise
or
the
chain
system
as
a
whole.
and
it
specifically
said
that
the
49
retails
stores
were
separate
establishments
as
were
--
as
were
the
central
warehouse
and
office
building.
and
it
held
--
it
held
this
even
though
it
expressly
recognized
that
the
separate
units
were
functionally
and
organizationally
completely
meshed
and
integrated.
the
court
pointed
out
that
this
was
usually
the
case
in
a
chain
enterprise,
that
the
very
purpose
of
the
chain
enterprise
was
to
integrate
and
--
and
operate
more
economically
by
integrated
and
functional
organization.
for
--
for
some
10
years
subsequent
to
the
phillips
decision
that
decision
has
been
assumed
to
have
settled
the
meaning
of
this
act
--
of
--
of
this
term
in
particular
relation
to
multi-unit,
multi-function
chain
organizations.
the
courts
below,
however,
decline
to
recognize
the
phillips
decision
as
controlling
in
the
instant
case
on
the
ground
that
the
ruling
in
the
phillips
decision
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
term
establishment
was
merely
obiter
dictum.
and
that
other
factors
distinguishable
from
the
facts
in
this
particular
case
determined
that
decision.
now,
we
submit
that
the
decisions
below
in
so
disregarding
or
so
treating
the
specific
thing
on
the
meaning
of
the
term
establishment
plainly
misapprehended
the
--
the
basic
ruling
of
that
decision
and
misunderstood
the
reasoning
on
which
that
particular
ruling
rested.
ms.
bessie
margolin
that
the
physically
distinct
unit
is
the
establishment
to
which
you
then
apply
the
other
conditions
of
the
exemption.
ms.
bessie
margolin
the
functional
aspect
of
--
has
no
bearing.
i
should
say
this
about
it.
i
think
that
the
decision,
the
opinion
recognizes
that
there
is
actually
some
functional
identity
in
any
of
these
chain
organizations,
that
there
is
a
functional
identity
to
each
separate
unit.
that's
a
realistic
fact
which
is
just
as
present
in
this
case
as
it
was
in
phillips.
but
the
emphasis
was
on
the
--
on
the
practical
test
of
the
physically
distinct
unit
because
it
is
a
--
a
realistic
problem.
as
the
court
said
the
--
this
exemption
has
a
limited
objective.
it
was
intended
to
exempt
the
small
retailer
and
local
retailer.
and
the
problem
presented
by
these
chain
organizations
is
how
to
carry
out
that
limited
objective,
give
the
chain
organization
the
benefit
of
that
objective
and
be
sure
that
it
gets
the
exemption
for
its
local
retailing
but
not
to
--
not
to
do
violence
to
the
exemption
and
the
purpose
of
it
by
giving
this
whole
harbored
organization
a
complete
exemption
from
the
act,
simply
because
it
combines
its
retail
functions
with
a
lot
of
other
functions.
now,
the
facts
in
this
particular
case,
i
think,
well
illustrate
that
realistic
problem
and
illustrate
the
reason.
the
court
said
that
the
key,
the
essential
key
to
meeting
that
problem
was
the
physically
distinct
unit
standard.
respondent
in
this
case
is
the
bekins
van
&
storage
company
of
california.
it
is
a
large
multi-million
dollar
chain
organization
of
storage
warehouses.
it
also
does
extensive
moving
where
--
which
is
not
involved
in
this
particular
case.
we're
concerned
here
with
their
storage
warehouse
business.
it
has
a
large
chain
of
--
of
warehouses,
36
in
the
state
of
california.
it
is
the
largest
storage
warehouse
business
in
the
country
according
to
its
own
statements.
it
--
it
has
admittedly
engaged
very
extensively
in
interstate
commerce
as
well
as
in
intrastate
household
storage.
and
it
is
also
admittedly
engaged
quite
extensively
in
non-retail
business,
as
well
as
in
the
storage
of
household
furniture
which
is
considered
to
be
retail.
the
facts
are
--
are
largely
stipulated
and
are
not
in
dispute.
it
was
stipulated
after
considerable
negotiation
and
conferences,
and
i'll
make
a
point
of
that
because
of
--
of
the
fact
that
the
respondent
has
--
seek
to
inject
some
doubt
as
to
the
facts
into
the
case
which
i
think
the
stipulation
was
expressly
foreclosed.
it
was
stipulated
that
if
the
alameda
warehouse,
which
is
one
of
the
warehouses,
which
is
the
one
warehouse
concerned
in
this
particular
suit,
that
if
the
alameda
warehouse
was
considered
as
a
separate
unit,
for
purposes
of
this
exemption,
it
did
not
meet
the
percentage
requirements
of
the
statute.
in
other
words,
more
than
50%
of
its
business
was
interstate
and
more
than
25%
of
it,
that
is,
at
least
75%
of
it,
was
not
--
was
not
retail.
now,
the
factor
that
--
the
point
that
respondent
has
sought
to
raise
is
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
all
of
the
--
whether
or
not
75%
of
its
business
was
retail.
that
fact
was
expressly
stipulated
away
because
--
undoubtedly
because
respondent
realized
that
the
burden
would
be
on
the
respondent
to
prove
that
it
was
retail.
and
it
was
expressly
agreed,
therefore,
that
it
did
not
meet
the
retail
sales
requirements
if
it
was
a
single
establishment.
now,
it
was
also
expressly
agreed
that
if
the
division
comprised
of
five
large
warehouses
including
a
central
office
and
which
served
all
of
the
warehouses
that
if
the
five
warehouses
into
which
respondent
classified
--
classified
alameda
as
a
part
of
a
division
if
--
if
that
whole
division
were
regarded
as
the
establishment,
then
the
requirements,
the
percentage
requirements
would
be
met.
in
other
words,
75%
of
their
business
was
of
the
household
storage
character.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
that
--
that
is
in
effect
what
it
is.
it's
not
quite
in
its
--
it's
a
little
more
realistic
than
it
sounds
because
there
are
a
variety
of
reasons
why
one
of
these
chain
organizations
developed.
undoubtedly
it's
--
there's
some
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
business
advantage
in
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
this
isn't
a
chain
organization.
ms.
bessie
margolin
it
isn't
a
chain
organization
if
it's
carried
on
all
in
one
--
in
one
building.
it
becomes
a
chain
organization
because
it
does
--
spreads
out
and
acquires
a
--
a
lot
of
different
places
of
business,
and
operates
at
various
places
of
business
and
there
are
obviously
business
advantages
to
--
to
placing
your
--
your
business
in
various
parts
of
a
state
or
various
parts
of
a
country.
and
the
--
the
various
warehouses
here,
admittedly
most
of
them,
do
carry
on
some
of
this
commercial
warehousing.
and
i
might
say
in
regard
to
the
non-retail
business
here,
it's
admittedly
quite
extensive
even
though
it
doesn't
constitute
as
much
as
25%
of
the
total
of
the
divisions
of
--
of
the
division's
business.
this
is
a
pretty
huge
outfit.
they
do
several
million
dollars
worth
of
storage
business
a
year
of
various
kinds
and
25%
of
their
business
being
commercial
means
a
--
quite
a
substantial
amount
of
commercial
warehousing
business.
they
--
the
--
the
--
in
--
in
fact,
it's
--
it's
more
than
most
single
unit
general
merchandising
warehouses
do
standing
alone,
the
--
the
total
amount
of
--
of
commercial
warehousing
by
bekins
company
is
admittedly
a
substantial
business
in
and
of
itself.
it
is
--
it
does
distribute
this
commercial
warehousing
among
several
of
its
warehouses.
i
think
most
of
them
have
a
little
but
it
varies
in
degree.
some
of
the
--
some
of
the
warehouses
have
very
little
of
the
commercial.
alameda
was
chosen
and
i
should
say
that
the
emphasis
that
--
that
respondent
places
on
the
fact
that
only
alameda
was
claimed
to
be
exempt
should
not
be
taken
too
literally
because
alameda
was
chosen
as
being
one
that
was
clearly
--
clearly
performing
so
much
commercial
and
so
much
interstate
storage
business
that
it
could
be
definitely
identified
as
not
meeting
the
requirements
of
the
exemption.
as
to
the
other
warehouses,
i
understand
only
one
or
two
of
them
were
even
inspected.
there
are,
of
course,
practical
limitations
and
limitations
of
appropriations
that
make
it
impossible
to
investigate
it
--
every
unit
of
--
of
a
large
chain.
alameda
was
obviously,
outstandingly
devoted
more
to
the
commercial
warehousing
than
the
others.
there
are
facts
in
the
record
though
that
show
that
this
is
a
fast-changing
business,
and
that
other
of
the
warehouses
were
increasing
their
commercial
warehousing.
and
the
investigation
of
this
--
this
last
investigation
occurred
are
now
almost
four
years
ago.
i
guess
a
little
over
four
years
now.
and
it
may
well
be
that
other
of
the
warehouses
and
they
have
now
become
so
much
more
commercial
that
they
would
no
longer
meet
the
requirements
of
the
exemptions.
ms.
bessie
margolin
no,
i
think
the
facts
show
that
they
did
keep
their
books
according
to
the
division.
they
kept
the
books
for
the
division.
they
kept
their
--
their
payrolls
that
their
--
it's
admitted
that
organizationally
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
they
operated
the
division
as
a
unit.
our
position
is
that
what
the
--
what
the
company
does
for
its
own
managerial
convenience
for
them
a
chain
does
for
its
own
managerial
convenience
can't
determine
whether
or
not
the
retail
establishment
exemption
applies,
that
that
is
an
aid
to
depend
upon
the
purpose
of
the
exemption
which
this
court
has
already
construed
and
which
congress
approved
at
the
time
of
the
1949
amendments
to
be
the
single
unit,
single
physically
separate
unit.
and
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
was
coming
and
some
of
the
facts
i've
mentioned
have
some
bearing
on
the
mootness
question.
i
thought
that
since
respondent
treats
that
as
a
subsidiary
issue,
and
that
i
might
come
to
the
point
which
we
think
is
the
main
point
in
the
case,
and
we'll
deal
with
that
a
little
later.
if
the
court
prefers
me
to
talk
about
the
mootness
point
first
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
will
come
to
it
and
some
of
the
facts
i
mentioned
have
some
relation
on
the
mootness
point.
the
--
the
question
then
was
whether
alameda
should
be
the
--
it
is
the
establishment
to
which
the
percentage
test
apply
or
whether
all
five
of
the
--
of
the
warehouses
including
a
central
warehouse
and
--
and
office,
a
central
office
building,
should
be
a
single
establishment
for
purposes
of
determining
the
application
of
this
exemption.
the
alameda
warehouse
on
--
is
--
that
is
admittedly
a
set
--
physically
separate
warehouse
and
it's
admittedly
in
the
heart
of
the
industrial
and
commercial
area
of
los
angeles.
it's
unlike
some
of
the
other
warehouses
in
the
division
which
are
in
largely
residential
areas.
it
has
some
60,000
square
feet
of
space
and
there's
no
question,
as
i've
said,
that
standing
alone
more
than
25%
of
the
storage
is
not
retail.
there's
no
question
either
that
the
interstate
business
carried
on
by
the
warehouses
in
this
division
including
alameda
as
they
get
--
it's
more
than
50%
in
alameda
by
stipulation.
these
warehouses,
these
five
warehouses
are
scattered
over
an
area
of
some
six
miles
in
los
angeles.
respondent
has
set
up
two
divisions
in
the
los
angeles
area
--
area,
the
east
los
angeles
and
the
west
los
angeles.
and
these
five
warehouses
in
the
east
los
angeles
division
is
the
one
--
is
the
one
involved
here.
they
cover
an
area
of
six
miles,
as
i
say,
and
each
warehouse
is
at
least
a
mile
and
three
quarters,
that
is
about
two
miles
apart,
distant
from
one
another.
each
one
has
its
own
separate
storing
space
and
its
own
separate
equipment,
the
alameda
has
a--
is
right
beside
a
spur
track
of
the
southern
pacific
rail
--
railroad
and
it
--
each
warehouse
has
its
own
working
foreman
--
its
own
foreman
rather
and
its
own
working
crew.
now,
respondent
makes
much
of
the
fact
that
there's
some
interchange
in
the
employees
and
the
stipulation,
i
think,
so
agree.
but
there's
no
question
but
that
the
employees
were
--
were
generally
identified
with
one
particular
warehouse.
in
this
warehouse,
for
example,
there
were
11
employees.
now,
it
is
true
that
when
needed
they
were
sometimes
sent
for
a
day
or
two
to
another
warehouse
but
their
identification
was
in
the
particular
alameda
warehouse.
and
that's
assuming
that
that
factor
would
have
any
bearing
on
it,
we
don't
think
it
does,
but
the
fact
is
that
--
that
each
of
these
warehouses
does
operate
functionally,
independently
to
a
large
degree
although,
organizationally
and
managerially
and
for
purposes
of
--
of
finance,
their
financial
arrangements,
the
company
operates
it
as
a
--
as
an
organizational
integrated
unit.
the
--
the
location
of
the
warehouses,
undoubtedly,
has
something
to
do
with
--
with
the
nature
of
the
functions
performed
there.
originally,
alameda
was
in
a
residential
section
and
most
of
its
warehousing
was
of
household
storage
type.
it
--
it
later
became
surrounded
with
the
industrial
and
commercial
area,
and
it
was
natural
for
the
type
of
its
business
to
change.
and
there's
no
question
but
that
location
itself
has
some
bearing
on
the
--
on
the
character,
the
retailing
and
non-retail
character
of
--
of
the
individual
unit.
now,
the
--
it
--
it
seem
to
us
that
--
it
seems
to
us
that
the
phillips
case
is
so
clearly
decisive
in
this
respect
that
we
find
it
difficult
to
--
to
know
how
to
treat
the
reasoning
of
the
court
below.
in
effect,
what
the
court
below
says
is
that
establishment
--
you
--
establishment
is
something
vague
and
variable
depending
on
what
the
particular
chain
organization
--
to
how
that
the
particular
chain
organization
decides
to
run
its
business.
the
--
it
emphasizes
that
the
phillips
case
was
dealing
with
the
--
a
wholesaler
function,
a
kind
of
wholesaler
function
which
is
different
from
the
function
here.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
--
that
the
function
here
is
very
--
very
close
--
very
much
alike
to
the
function
of
the
warehouse
in
the
phillips
case.
it
is
a
wholesaler
function.
in
the
books
in
the
standard
authorities
on
general
merchandise
warehousing,
they
point
out
that
the
type
of
warehousing
for
dealers
and
manufacturers
is
a
link
in
the
service
chain
between
the
producer
and
the
distributor
and
the
consumer.
that's
precisely
the
--
the
type
of
function
that
the
phillips,
the
chain
store
warehouse
serves,
and
the
independent
wholesaler
warehouse
serves.
so
we
don't
believe
there's
any
factual
distinction
possible
there
without
searching
and
trying
to
ferret
out
some
insignificant
factual
difference.
i
think
it
--
it
might
be
pointed
out
with
the
--
with
due
respect
to
the
ninth
circuit
that
it
has
not
had
a
case
under
this
particular
exemption
since
the
philipps
decision.
the
ninth
circuit
was
one
of
the
courts
of
appeals
that
had
held
contrary
to
the
phillips
case
prior
to
this
court's
decision.
it
was
one
of
the
cases
that
was
a
--
a
reason
for
the
conflict
that
--
that
brought
about
the
grant
of
certiorari.
and
it
seems
that
the
ninth
circuit
unconsciously
or
instinctively
was
reverting
back
to
its
--
its
previous
reluctance
to
accept
the
phillips
decision.
the
effect
of
it
has
been
to
revive
all
of
the
uncertainty
that
--
that
previously
existed
prior
to
the
phillips
decision
when
there
was
a
great
variety
of
opinions
and
conflicts
among
four
or
five
circuits,
and
--
and
the
--
this
--
this
court
finally
resolved
it
in
the
phillips
decision.
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
is
of
--
of
particular
importance
because
it
seems
to
revive
most
of
that
uncertainty
and
that's
the
one
--
one
of
the
main
reasons
why
we
were
concerned
to
have
this
court
consider
it.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
much
more
of
the
commercial
warehousing,
warehousing
storage
of
goods
for
dealers
and
manufacturers
as
done
in
the
--
in
the
alameda
warehouse
than
in
the
others.
it
does
also
carry
on
some
household
storage,
too.
but
the
--
the
--
it
carries
on
so
much
of
the
commercial
storage
that
that
what
is
what
characterizes
it
under
the
test
of
the
exemption
rather
than
the
household
storage.
ms.
bessie
margolin
as
being
non-retail.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
this
--
this
kind
of
commercial
storage
it
was
agreed,
it
was
stipulated
that
this
was
not
retail.
now,
i
appreciate
and
i'm
reluctant
to
get
into
that
difficult
problem
because
i
appreciate
there
is
a
problem
as
to
whether
a
--
a
service
for
commercial
--
for
a
business
or
commercial
consumer
is
always
non-retail.
that
is
a
--
a
problem
which
has
given
us
some
difficulty
in
other
cases.
that
question
is
not
involved
here,
although,
respondent
has
--
has
cryptically
suggested
it
might
be
because
we
deliberately
stipulated
that
the
commercial
storage
here
was
not
retail,
was
very
deliberately
done.
and
i
think
there's
enough
in
the
record
to
support
that
but
if
there
weren't,
there's
--
if
it
hadn't
been
stipulated,
there's
a
great
deal
of
other
evidence
which
respondent
well
knows
that
they
brought
in
to
show
that
it
is
not
recognized
as
retail
in
the
industry.
there's
a
great
deal
of
u.s.
bonded
storage,
for
example,
at
this
warehouse
which
is
the
storage
for
customs
on
exports,
the
dealers
and
importers
bring
in.
and
respondent
well
knows
there
was
a
great
deal
of
evidence
that
could
have
been
introduced
if
this
had
not
been
stipulated
specifically
to
avoid
having
to
get
into
that.
so
that
question
is
not
involved
here.
this
is
definitely
not
retail.
our
--
we'll
--
we'll
leave
--
oh,
i
will
--
i
wanted
to
point
out
that
the
1949
amendments,
if
there
were
ever
any
reasonable
doubt
about
the
phillips
decision
having
ruled
that
its
this
--
the
individual
separate
physically
distinct
unit
that's
the
establishment.
the
1949
amendments
and
what
congress
said
in
the
legislative
history
about
the
--
those
amendments,
i
think,
dispelled
any
possible
doubt.
the
--
the
reports
of
the
--
in
the
first
place,
no
--
nothing
was
changed
about
the
term
retail
establishment.
that
term
was
retained
and
throughout
the
debates
it
was
assumed
that
the
term
establishment
was
--
was
to
be
given
the
same
meaning
that
it'd
been
given
all
along.
and
it
was
expressly
so
stated
several
times
in
this
--
in
the
report
of
the
majority
of
the
senate
conferees
and
in
the
debates
by
the
sponsors
of
the
amendments.
and
we
quote
those
statements
where
the
--
where
it's
--
it's
expressly
stated
that
the
phillips
decision,
similar
question
and
congress
was
satisfied
with
the
phillips
definition
of
it,
and
they
didn't
intend
to
change
the
phillips
ruling
on
the
--
what
the
term
establishment
meant
in
any
respect.
ms.
bessie
margolin
now,
we
quote
that
from
the
--
the
report
of
the
senate
conferees
on
page
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
think
it's
30
--
21.
no,
that's
senator
holland's
statement.
on
page
19,
top
of
page
19,
the
report
of
the
senate
--
the
majority
of
the
senate
conferees
states,
"under
the
present
law,
phillips
v.
walling,
a
retail
establishment
needs
a
physically
separate
place
of
business
which
possesses
the
characteristics
of
a
retailer
and
does
not
mean
an
entire
business
enterprise.
the
conference
agreement
in
no
way
changes
the
meaning
of
the
term
establishment."
now,
that
--
that
statement
is
merely
a
--
a
restatement
of
the
same
point
which
senator
george
made
and
senator
holland
made
during
the
course
of
the
debates.
i
think
that
respondent
attacks
that
on
the
grounds
that
the
senate
conferees'
report
was
never
read
to
--
to
send
it
before
they
passed
the
amendment.
i
might
take
issue,
although
i
--
i
think,
that
there's
no
doubt
of
its
importance
to
the
legislative
history
to
take
issue
with
this
statement
that
that
makes
the
report
of
the
--
the
majority
of
the
senate
conferees
have
no
use
whatsoever.
but
in
this
particular
case,
it
doesn't
matter
because
that
was
simply
a
restatement
of
what,
during
the
debates,
the
sponsors
of
the
amendment
themselves
told
the
senate.
senator
george,
for
example,
stated,
i
wish
to
say
that
the
word
establishment
has
been
very
well
defined
in
the
wage
and
hour
act.
it
means
now
a
single
physically
separate
place
of
business
which
possesses
the
characteristics
of
a
retailer,
and
it
does
not
mean
an
entire
business
enterprise.
and
senator
holland
emphasized
the
same
point
when
he
was
asked
specifically
what
effect
would
this
amendment
have
upon
chain
stores
and
he
answered,
"it
leaves
them
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
they
are
today."
this
was
the
holding
in
the
united
states
supreme
court
in
phillips
v.
walling
and
there's
no
intent
in
the
proposed
amendment
to
--
to
change
such
holding.
now,
that's
quoted
on
page
21
of
our
brief,
too.
there
were
--
respondent
quotes
out
of
context
a
--
an
excerpt
from
the
house
managers
--
statement
of
the
house
managers
which
with
some
reluctance
i
say
is
flagrantly
out
of
context
because
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
the
preceding
sentences,
i
think,
show
precisely
what
was
intended
by
that.
what
the
respondent
seeks
to
do
is
just
--
just
to
argue
that
the
word
"buy"
the
--
originally
the
amendment
read
any
employee
engaged
in
a
retail
establishment.
and
respondent
takes
the
quote
which
standing
alone
might
be
construed
to
--
to
read
that
the
establishment
is
no
longer
important,
it's
--
it's
by
the
business
now.
well
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
it's
a
building
which
is
a
place
of
business.
ms.
bessie
margolin
that's
right.
ms.
bessie
margolin
oh,
we
say
it's
a
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
it's
a
separate
place
of
business
where
there
it
is
carrying
on
all
this
--
all
this
storage.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
we
say
it's
something
more
than
a
physical
building.
ordinarily,
in
these
chain
organizations
and
that's
what
this
is,
in
a
chain
organization
ordinarily
each
separate
building
is
a
--
a
separate
place
of
business.
ms.
bessie
margolin
and
we
say
these
buildings,
two
miles
apart
with
their
own
facilities,
their
own
group
of
employees,
thus
are
physically
distinct
places
of
business
within
the
meaning
of
the
phillips
case.
ms.
bessie
margolin
oh,
what
the
court
here
has
said,
"i
don't
know
how
you
would
go
about
applying
it
because
it
just
says
that
depends
on
how
the
employer
decides
to
run
its
business."
the
simplicity
as
well
as
the
realism
of
the
phillips
decision,
it
may
not
always
work
out
in
or
always
work
out
fairly
and
equitably
and
it
does
leave
some
leeway
for
evasion
concededly.
but
on
the
whole
it
is
the
only
practical
standard
for
getting
any
certainty
into
this
exemption
at
all.
and
--
and
if
you
depart
from
that
standard
the
whole
thing
is
completely
vague.
you've
got
to
know
what
the
establishment
is
and
it
has
to
be
something
tangible.
if
it's
left
to
depend
just
on
the
managerial
choice
of
how
the
employer
operates
his
business
for
his
own
convenience,
that
the
purpose
is
wholly
irrelevant
to
the
exemption
then
the
--
it
--
it
can
disrupt
the
--
the
entire
organization
back.
and
i
might
say
that
this
exemption
is
so
--
is
so
widespread
in
its
--
in
its
impact.
it
affects
not
only
this
industry
but
it
has
an
impact
on
virtually
every
industry
within
the
--
within
the
coverage
--
the
general
coverage
of
the
act.
and
it
can
cause
the
utmost
disruption.
this
particular
exemption
can
cause
the
greatest
disruption
in
the
application
of
the
act
if
--
if
it's
thrown
into
uncertainty
again
on
that
score.
now,
there
is
uncertainty
on
some
other
scores
but
if
that
particular
aspect
of
it
is
again
thrown
into
uncertainty
we've
got
to
start
all
over
again.
i
might
point
out
that
the
congress,
a
number
of
them,
took
occasion
to
say
we
don't
want
to
upset
this
exemption
to
such
an
extent.
it's
been
litigated
for
10
or
11
years
and
the
supreme
court
has
come
down
with
some
pretty
realistic
practical
decisions.
we
don't
want
to
reopen
all
that
for
litigation
again.
this
occurred
during
legislative
history.
now,
it
was
that
--
that
was
said
about
some
of
the
things
that
actually
went
in.
but
on
the
term
establishment,
they
all
made
it
clear
that
they
weren't
--
didn't
expect
any
further
litigation
on
that
because
that
was
settled
by
phillips.
that
--
that's
the
one
thing
that
was
made
clear
and
some
legislative
history
which
is
not
in
our
brief
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
of
course,
that's
the
--
that's
the
parade
of
parables
that's
usually
given.
if
they
were
all
operated
as
a
physical
unit
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
would
say
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
would
say
they
would
--
would
still
be
separate.
now,
why
we
don't
have
that
practical
problem
is
because
when
they
are
usually
at
--
when
they
are
operated
that
contiguously,
they
usually
are
all
retail.
ms.
bessie
margolin
so
it
isn't
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
geographical
is
not
the
controlling
--
it
is
--
it
is
one
aspect.
but
when
they
are
all
operated
we've
found
as
a
practical
matter
when
they
are
all
in
the
same
location
and
just
in
a
series
of
buildings,
they
usually
are
all
retail.
so
you
don't
have
the
practical
problem.
but
here
you
do
have
some
of
them
are
predominantly
retail
and
--
and
some
aren't.
and
in
that
situation
as
they
were
doing
different
kinds
of
business,
we
would
treat
them
as
--
as
each
a
separate
establishment.
i
might
just
say
a
word
of
moot
--
about
the
mootness
point
which,
however,
i
think,
since
has
been
raised
at
this
late
date
by
respondent
that
i
would
prefer
to
treat
in
rebuttal
because
i
don't
know
to
what
extent
he
really
intends
to
press
it.
he
made
all
of
the
same
arguments
in
response
to
the
--
in
our
position
to
the
petition
of
a
certiorari.
although,
he
refrained
from
claiming
that
the
case
was
moot.
he
claimed
that
this
showed
that
the
case
was
no
longer
of
sufficient
importance
to
warrant
review
by
the
court.
but
he
didn't
assert
it
was
moot
and
we
thought
that
the
reason
he
didn't
was
that
it
was
so
clearly
not
moot
under
all
of
the
decisions
of
this
court.
now,
for
the
first
time
in
his
brief,
respondent
does
assert
that
the
case
is
technically
moot
placing
main
reliance
on
the
w.t.
grant
case.
well,
the
w.t.
grant
case
did
not
or
it
was
not
a
ruling
on
--
on
mootness.
it
was
a
ruling
on
the
question
of
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court
to
grant
or
to
deny
a
relief
where
before
the
decision
--
before
the
decision
of
the
trial
court
it
was
--
there
was
admittedly
a
--
a
cessation
of
the
challenged
conduct.
there
was
no
decision
in
the
grant
case
on
the
merits.
the
court
--
the
trial
court
simply
held
that
since
violations
had
admittedly
ceased
and
there
was
no
threat
or
no
contention
that
they
would
be
resumed,
then
in
its
discretion
it
denied
an
injunctive
relief.
it
was
not
outstanding,
any
decision
on
the
merits
which
was
claimed
to
be
a
--
a
--
an
authoritative
decision
as
there
is
here.
and
the
court
specific
--
this
court
specifically
held
that
that
case
was
not
moot.
it
affirmed
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
a
proper
exercise
of
discretion.
there's
no
question
in
this
case
as
to
the
exercise
of
discretion.
admittedly,
the
violations
here
of
the
non-compliance
were
continuing
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
admittedly,
they
were
still
going
on
all
through
the
appellate
stage.
it's
claimed
only
that
the
union
agreement
after
the
court
of
appeals
decision
puts
a
stop
to
the
threat
of
violation.
meanwhile,
we've
--
had
continued
--
we've
had
all
this
litigation,
and
respondent
is
still
vehemently
contending
that
his
--
this
conduct
is
legal.
and
as
i
pointed
out
this
has
significance
not
only
with
respect
to
this
particular
warehouse
but
with
respect
to
put
potentially
for
other
warehouses
of
respondent's
own,
as
well
as
to
establishments
in
virtually
every
other
industry
within
the
general
coverage
of
this
act.
and
there
being
that
public
interest
in
having
it
settled
under
this
court's
decision
it's
--
it's
plainly
not
moot.
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
--
i
don't
think
that
the
record
supports
the
repeated
statement
by
a
counsel
that
the
bekins
company
would
be
delighted
if
they
could
have
had
all
of
these
based
in
--
in
one
place.
and
this
will
answer,
i
think,
the
questions
put
by
mr.
justice
brennan
and
i
think
and
--
and
place
it
in
--
in
the
chief
justice's
questions.
these
various
buildings
and
there
is
evidence
in
--
in
the
record
showing
how
they
acquired
these
various
buildings
on
the
record
at
page
126.
it
started
out
in
1898
when
they
constructed
the
alameda
warehouse.
and
they
operated
alameda,
apparently,
as
the
single
warehouse
until
along
in
1947,
that's
almost
10
years
later
or
nine
years
later.
then
they
found
that
the
residential
section
was
moving
and
so
they
--
they
constructed
a
warehouse
further
out
in
the
residential
areas
several
miles
away.
that
was
--
that
was
the
figueroa
warehouse.
then
the
residential
areas
start
moving
from
figueroa.
it's
obvious
that
they
want
to
hold
on
to
the
residential
market,
as
their
downtown
market
was
becoming
more
commercial,
they
won't
moved
out
and
--
and
into
the
residential
areas
to
hold
on
to
the
residential
market.
then
some
20
years
later,
they
purchased
a
warehouse.
they
purchased
some
property
and
built
the
crenshaw
warehouse,
also
in
a
residential
area.
that's
20
years
after
the
--
the
third
one,
the
second
one.
then
in
1931,
that's
several
years
later,
they
purchased
the
wilshire
warehouse.
they
purchased
that
from
an
independent
concern
that
was
operating
it.
and
then
in
1942,
they
purchased
another
one
and
now
that's
the
five
warehouses
in
this
area,
all
purchased
years
apart
and
in
different
areas
and
obviously
to
--
to
follow
the
market.
they
didn't
want
all
of
this
--
obviously
didn't
want
all
the
storage
downtown.
they
want
to
get
out
into
the
residential
area
because,
admittedly,
their
main
business
has
been
the
household
storage.
however,
although
their
main
business
is
the
household
storage,
they
have
held
on
to
these
downtown
storage
warehouses
and
they
have
developed
a
quite
extensive
commercial
warehouse
in
the
u.s.
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
why
they
--
how
they
organized
these
divisions.
appear
--
it
appears
to
be
a
purely
internal
management
reasons
as
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
thought
they
were
just
the
two,
east
los
angeles
and
west
los
angeles.
there
are
some
i
think
in
the
surrounding
area.
ms.
bessie
margolin
no.
ms.
bessie
margolin
no,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
why.
i
think
judging
--
you
can
glean
from
the
record
that
it
might
be
as
--
as
esoterically
reason
is
simply
that
they
have
an
experienced
manager
who
can
handle
five
warehouses.
whereas
somewhere
else
where
they're
going
into
a
new
area,
they
may
--
maybe
more
difficult
to
get
started
and
so
they'll
put
one
warehouse
in
the
division.
but
it
seems
to
be
a
purely
internal
management
proposition,
nothing
to
do
with
the
purpose
of
this
exemption.
ms.
bessie
margolin
no,
i
do
not
agree
with
that.
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
think
they
--
they
have
--
the
record
does
show
that
the
customer
can
call
any
warehouse
they
want
but
it
has
to
be
there.
ms.
bessie
margolin
and
it
also
shows
that
the
tendency
is
to
put
storage
in
the
--
in
the
warehouse
which
is
most
convenient
to
him.
now,
the
alameda
warehouse
is
in
the
telephone
directory.
in
fact,
it's
in
east
los
angeles
division
if
not
in
1956
telephone
directory.
ms.
bessie
margolin
alameda
is
listed
as
the
alameda
district
and
you
can
telephone
the
alameda
warehouse.
they
advertised
all
of
these
locations.
ms.
bessie
margolin
no,
a
warehouse
business
just
isn't
operated
that
way.
now,
you
call
in
and
--
and
ask
--
you'll
call
in
and
ask
them
to
call
for
your
storage
and
you
don't
go
in
and
purchase
anything
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
of
all
the
selling
being
done
from
figueroa
is
nonsense.
you're
not
purchasing
something
from
figueroa.
you
call
in
and
want
just
your
goods
stored.
or
you
arrange
the
commercial
user,
the
industrial
user
arranges
to
have
his
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
no,
the
evidence
doesn't
show
really
where
they
call.
they
usually
group
their
calls
to
some
other
warehouses
because
they
prefer
to
handle
them
centrally.
and
then
they
allocated
the
calling
to
where
it's
most
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
and
i'd
like
to
--
i
think
i
can
illustrate
a
--
a
point
very
clearly
and
it's
one
the
chief
justice
gave
us
by
just
to
turn
your
example
a
little
bit.
i
think
it
--
it
confirms
that
the
point
i
think
you
were
making,
you
asked
--
suppose
that
--
there
were
no
divisions
and
that
all
of
the
warehouses
were
operated
as
one
division.
would
alameda
then
be
a
secret
establishment?
take
the
converse
of
that
situation,
suppose
alameda
was
the
only
warehouse
that
was
being
operated
by
--
by
bekins,
there's
no
question
at
all,
no
question
at
all
that
alameda
would
not
be
exempt
because
it
does
not
meet
the
requirements,
the
percentage
requirements.
now,
should
this
company
because
it
has
been
able
to
expand
and
prosper
and
acquire
36
more
warehouses,
is
that
a
reason
for
saying
that
alameda
should
be
exempt,
when
it
would
plainly
not
be
exempt
if
it
were
the
alameda
warehouse
being
operated
by
bekins?
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
it
depends
on
--
but
i'm
--
i'm
showing
the
reason
why
this
is
a
place
of
business
and
why
it
is
practical
and
reasonable
to
regard
it
as
a
separate
establishment.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
this
--
this
warehouse
operates
like
over
a
thousand
above
the
general
merchandizing
warehouses
which
are
not
exempt
because
they
do
not
do
75%
retail
activities.
you
can
go
to
this
place
of
business,
you
can
go
to
alameda,
you
can
look
at
the
type
of
storage
and
--
and
they
have
records
as
to
the
type
of
storage
down
there.
the
fact
that
they
don't
assemble
them
in
a
central
place
doesn't
mean
they
don't
have
the
records
because
they
have
to
give
--
under
the
california
uniform
warehouse
act,
they
have
to
give
warehouse
receipts
as
to
just
where
a
storage
is
located.
so
they
have
those
records
and
they
know
just
what
kind
of
storage
is
that
--
where
--
at
alameda
and
you
can
go
there
and
look
at
the
type
of
storage
they're
handling
there.
and
you
can
see
that
it
operates
just
as
this
other
single
--
singly
owned
general
merchandizing
warehouses
operate.
it's
a
--
it's
a
place
where
that
type
of
business
is
carried
on.
now,
mr.
smith
mentioned
that
the
thing
that
--
it's
the
business
significance
is
the
important
thing
not
the
location.
we
agree
with
him
but
we
say
that
this
has
significance,
has
business
significance
by
reason
of
the
type
a
function
carried
on
there
as
well
as
by
reason
of
its
location.
now,
very
little
has
been
said
virtually
nothing
about
--
by
mr.
smith
about
the
purpose
of
this
exemption.
and
i
think
that
to
get
in
perspective
the
reason
for
the
--
for
the
conclusion
that
ordinarily
and
that
--
only
practical
solution
for
this
problem
is
the
distinct
physical
unit.
we
have
to
--
to
come
back
to
the
purpose
of
this
exemption.
and
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
original
act
and
this
was
reaffirmed
emphatically
at
the
time
of
1949
amendments,
what
congress
had
basically
in
mind
was
the
small
local
retailer
that
they
put
the
--
kind
of
grocery
store,
the
retailer
shop,
the
drug
store,
the
department
store
and
the
filling
station,
the
barber
shop,
things
of
that
type.
they
repeatedly
--
the
restaurants,
cafeterias,
repeatedly,
they
said
that's
what
they
had
in
mind,
the
small
local
retail.
now,
it
happens
that
some
local
retailers
aren't
small.
but
basically,
what
they
had
in
mind
was
the
small
local
retailer.
now,
that
is
the
reason
you
look
at
what
is
like
a
small
local
retail
establishment.
is
this
a
group
of
five
warehouses
with
immense
amount
of
storage
base
located
two
miles
apart?
is
that
anything
like
the
--
the
kind
of
grocery
store
or
the
repair
--
shoe
repair
shop?
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
we
say
that
they
should
not
treat
--
that
you
cannot
treat
the
division
as
a
unit
because
it's
completely
inconsistent
with
the
purpose
of
the
exemption.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i'm
--
i'm
explaining
why
the
term
establishment
was
judged
to
mean
as
the
--
the
local
--
the
physical
place
of
business.
the
--
the
division
really
doesn't
mean
anything.
they
could
say
that
the
whole
--
the
whole
36
warehouses
of
all
the
warehouses
they
have
all
over
the
country
was
one
division.
it
--
it
has
no
meaning
whatsoever
so
far
as
the
purpose
of
this
exemption
is
concerned.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
all
of
the
warehouses
in
los
angeles
were
operated
as
one
division
before
1938.
they
just
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
no,
not
necessarily.
and
i
meant
to
--
i
--
i
was
intending
to
get
to
that
point
because
we
have
--
we
take
the
position.
the
problem
here
is
where
you
have
a
--
an
--
a
business
that's
extensively
engaged
in
other
than
retail
function.
the
problem
that's
presented
is
how
to
apply
the
purpose
of
this
exemption.
is
there
any
practical
means
of
breaking
down
their
activities
and
--
and
applying
it
where
it
was
intended
to
apply
but
not
to
apply
it
to
all
of
--
all
--
all
these
activities
which
were
clearly
intended
to
be
covered
and
which
are
covered
when
carried
on
by
competitors.
now,
even
if
it
were
in
a
single
building
and
courts
have
held
this
and
we
take
this
position,
if
it
said
resemble
--
if
it
is
as
a
--
factually,
physically
segregable
in
the
same
building
even,
you
would
take
it
as
a
separate
unit.
for
example,
we
have
taken
automobile
dealers
in
places
where
they
sell
automobile
and
repair
parts
and
--
and
they
have
a
great
deal
of
over-the-counter
sales
and
then
they
also
supply
bus
companies,
the
truckers
and
do
a
large
wholesale
business.
we
have
permitted
them
if
--
if
they
segregate
--
if
it's
segregated
and
there's
a
petition
in
the
same
building,
we
have
said
you
can
take
advantage
of
the
retailer
establishment
exemption
for
that
retail
part
of
the
business,
if
it's
identifiable
and
--
and
can
be
segregated
and
you
don't
have
to
include
the
whole
thing
and
see
if
it's
75%.
ms.
bessie
margolin
that's
right.
but
physical
segregation
gives
you
the
most
practical
means
of
seeing
that
it
--
that
the
functions
are
segregated.
in
other
words,
you
look
for
some
practical
way
to
breakdown
these
various
activities.
now,
bekins,
probably
does
more
non-retail,
commercial
storage
than
any
other
storage
warehouse
in
the
country.
and
if
--
if
it
were
doing
that
as
--
as
a
separate
business,
it
would
certainly
be
covered
in
the
singly
operated
general
merchandise
warehouses
are
covered
by
this
act.
they
are
not
exempt.
bekins
does
probably
more
of
that
type
of
business
than
any
one
of
the
singly
operated
and
owned
warehouses
in
the
country.
ms.
bessie
margolin
because
they
--
they
are
such
a
large
outlet.
and
they
have
--
they
have
branched
into
the
commercial
business.
now,
they
are
in
a
position
to
get
the
benefit
of
taking
some
of
this
commercial
storage
to
some
of
their
retail
warehouses
and
we
admit
that
the
act
gives
them
that
loophole.
but
when
you
can't
find
a
warehouse
and
identify
it,
it's
being
like
a
general
merchandise
warehouse
which
is
covered.
certainly,
that
is
the
practical
basis
for
holding
that
that
is
a
separate
establishment.
ms.
bessie
margolin
yes.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i'm
thinking
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
it
could
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
suppose
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i'll
give
you
one
example
as
--
and
i
think
this
is
--
this
isn't
in
the
record
but
i
think
as
a
practical
matter,
this
is
true.
you
have
abounded
custom
storage
is
done
on
the
basis
of
designating
certain
floors
of
certain
building.
now,
if
they
had
certain
floors
and
that
this
distinction,
too,
the
commercial
storage
is
on
a
different
charge
than
the
household
storage.
household
storage
is
usually
--
is
as
charged
on
a
poundage
basis
and
a
commercial
storage
is
on
the
cubic
of
square
foot
and
it's
usually
in
much
larger
areas.
suppose
they
--
they
would
have
a
tendency
to
put
the
same
kinds
of
goods
in
the
same
--
in
--
in
a
particular
location
or
on
particular
floor.
now,
the
physical
location
--
the
physical
distinction
is
important
because
you
need
--
you
need
some
boundaries
for
the
--
to
apply
the
percentages.
but
if
they
had
a
floor
where
they
use
a
great
deal
with
the
commercial
storage,
i
think
you
could
say
that
at
particular
section
or
if
they
had
one-half
of
the
building
used
for
commercial
storage.
i
think
you
could
say
that
portion
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
that's
right.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i
think
that
that
was
a
practical
solution
which
this
court
reached
after
a
great
thought
and
thinking
in
terms
of
the
type
of
establishment
congress
said
it
had
in
mind
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
it
goes
to
the
individual
unit
where
you
had
a
multiunit
of
business.
ms.
bessie
margolin
congress
all
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
frequently
has
other
problems
in
mind
and
doesn't
deal
with
a
particular
problem
and
what
seems
to
be
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
the
most
effective
way
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
so
during
that
in
its
relations
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
it
certainly
is
--
is
not
--
doesn't
operate
perfectly
in
that
fashion.
but
on
the
whole,
and
in
general,
and
what
we
said
in
our
bulletin,
in
general,
ordinarily,
the
separate
physical
unit
is
the
most
practical
basis
for
applying.
and
this
--
this
court,
i
think
in
the
phillips
case,
accepted
that,
not
as
the
perfect
solution
but
as
the
most
practical
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
then
what?
i'll
say,
too,
there
are
also
other
factors.
ms.
bessie
margolin
but
that
is
certainly
one
factor.
we
have
--
we
have
never
--
the
counsel
has
represented
our
position
as
relying
solely
on
geographical
location.
that
isn't
true.
because
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
in
this
type
of
varied
function
enterprise,
there
are
other
factors
that
identify
a
unit
as
an
establishment.
and
it's
almost
always
so
then
he
might
dream
up
a
--
a
hypothetical
case
were
it
isn't
so
and
they
may
be
actual
cases
where
it
isn't
so.
but
ordinarily,
it
is
also
a
functional
unit
and
the
fact
that
bookkeeping
is
kept
one
way.
the
bookkeeping
unit
is
certainly
not
the
place
of
business
unit.
a
company
can
keep
book
stuff
and
all
sorts
of
ways
and
for
a
variety
of
purposes.
it
keeps
--
presents
the
books
for
one
warehouse
where
it
has
one
warehouse
in
the
division.
there's
no
reason
why
--
why
it
can't.
it
says
it
doesn't
do
so
because
it's
more
economical.
it
did
so
when
--
when
alameda
was
a
single
establishment
then
it
should
require
others
establishments,
of
course,
it
was
more
economical
as
it
is
in
--
in
other
chain
organizations
to
keep
the
books
together.
but
its
basic
to
this
act
that
if
--
if
an
employer
wants
to
claim
an
exemption,
the
burden
is
on
him
to
keep
the
records
to
show
that
he's
entitled
to
it
just
as
a
taxpayer
who
wants
to
claim
exemptions.
he
must
keep
the
records
to
show
he
is
entitled
to
the
exemption.
and
if
--
if
the
fact
that
they
--
maybe
a
little
more
expensive
to
keep
those
records
and
troublesome,
there's
certainly
no
reason
for
saying
that
--
that
this
is
making
them
breakdown
their
whole
business
if
we
treat
this
on
a
unit
basis.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
my
first
answer
to
that
is
that
i
don't
think
you
have
the
problem
now.
ms.
bessie
margolin
my
first
answer
to
it
is
i
don't
think
you
have
the
problem
now
because
congress,
i
think,
has
approved
the
administrators.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
we
have
in
our
brief--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
the
section
16
(c)
argument.
we've
quoted
the
regulation
which
says
whether
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
--
i
think
congress
has
in
affect
adopted
it
and
moreover
--
in
relation
to
this
specific
exemption,
congress
said
that
the
administrators
--
they
knew
they
were
opening
an
area
in
some
aspects
of
it
which
was
doubtful
and
a
great
weight
should
be
attached
to
the
administrator.
but
i
think
the
--
under
section
16
(c),
in
--
in
addition
to
the
explicit
legislative
history
saying,
we're
adopting
the
physical
distinct
unit
and
there
are
some
that
even
talks
of
it
as
a
single
building,
senator
--
colloquy
between
senator
george
and
senator
pepper.
but
the
section
16
(c)
of
the
1949
amendments
adopted
as
a
law,
the
administrative
interpretation
then
in
effect
and
not
in
consistent
with
the
terms
of
the
amendments.
then
in
effect
and
there's
always
almost
consistently,
always
in
the
beginning
of
the
act
and
these
are
quoted
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
the
administrator
said,
“well,
there
are
several
units,
ordinarily,
the
--
the
physical
branch
or
unit,
the
physically
distinct
branch
or
unit
will
be
considered
as
separate
establishment.”
and
that
was
in
--
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
1949
amendments
and
we
think
that
the
effect
of
that
was
to
make
that
--
make
that
the
law.
there's
no
suggestion
anywhere
in
the
legislative
history
in
respondent's
and
part
to
--
to
nothing,
suggesting
that
there
should
be
any
change
in
the
administrative
interpretation
as
to
what
is
meant
by
the
establishment.
the
only
changes
were
what
it
meant
by
retail
as
distinguished
from
a
non-retail
sale
of
service.
but
there
was
no
suggestion
that
there
should
be
any
change
in
the
administrative
interpretation
of
what
the
establishment
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
think
so
your
honor.
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
think
--
i
think
you'll
find
enough
there
to
reach
that
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
the
--
the
courts
regulations?
ms.
bessie
margolin
its
appendix
b,
mr.
justice
harlan,
on
page
35.
the
question
has
been
raised
as
to
the
scope
of
the
term
establishment.
this
is
the
part
of
1949
amendments.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
we
--
we
always
try
to
protect
ourselves
so
we
don't
get
into
utterly
impractical
situations
when
he
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i
think
this
is
pretty
clear
as
it
--
the
government
always
tries
to
be
a
little
cautious
and
not
to
state
everything
completely,
flatly.
ms.
bessie
margolin
yes,
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
i
think
the
congress
can
undertake
--
undertakes
to
--
the
basis
on
which
it
undertakes
to
--
to
distinguish
it
doesn't
place
it
in
any
extraordinary
filings.
there's
--
it's
no
reason
for
distinguishing
it
except
it
doesn't
accept
our
view
of
it.
they
--
they
repudiated
this
interpretation.
i
would
like
to
call
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
attention
to
--
particularly,
to
some
of
the
legislative
history
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
but
along
with
other
citations.
and
i
think
you'll
find
a
little
more
specifically,
congress
has
--
specifically
recognizing
the
single
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
this
particular
thing
--
in
this
particular
page
is
not
holding.
ms.
bessie
margolin
and
it's
in
the
colloquy
between
senator
pepper
and
senator
george
in
95
congressional
records
on
page
12579.

bessie
margolin
