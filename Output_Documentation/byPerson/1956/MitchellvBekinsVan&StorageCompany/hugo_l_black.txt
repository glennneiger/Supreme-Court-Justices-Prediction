page
is
that
on
your
brief?
justice

no.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
how
you
--
on
the
quotation
you
have
which
has
been
--
again,
if
you
didn't
have
the
previous
sum,
what
do
you
say
about
that
--
those
previous
two
sum
supported
in
the
government's
brief
at
18
and
19
--
19
and
20?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
all
chain
stores
have
manufacturing
functions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
distinction
do
you
draw
on
this
--
the
information
that
you're
--
between
the
system
at
your
part
and
the
regular
chain
store
system
with
warehouses?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
they
have
then
in
regular
chain
store
systems,
do
they
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
money
--
does
the
money
from
all
these
divisions,
which
you
call
divisions,
go
into
the
same
treasury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
they
--
are
there
rules
that
govern
them
promulgated
by
the
same
head
group?
the
general
rules
that
they
have
to
obey.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
before
the
chain
stores
do
anything.
justice
hugo
l.
black
me
--
well,
now
that's
it.
what
are
the
distinctions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
of
these
so-called
divisions
are
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
--
are
they
all
warehouses?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
are
the
other
agencies
in
the
division?
institutions
or
establishments
or
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
nothing
but
warehouses?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
all
run
under
a
general
plan
from
above.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
these
managers
work
for
that
one
company.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
said
they
never
transfer
employees
from
one
to
another?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
are
the
others
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
some
distance
away.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
quotation
here
are
--
what
does
make
it
relevant
definitely,
as
to
whether
this
is
like
to
change
door
like
if
you
see
this
robot
having
its
division
as
a
matter
and
i
think
they
will
have
a
superintendent
of
all
division
whether
its
maybe
half
a
dozen
stores,
but
each
one
operates
separately
as
you
say
with
a
lot
of
competition
among
them.
i
--
i
don't
see
yet
what's
the
difference
between
your
place
and
one
like
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
the
--
the
statement
here
as
to
this
does
not
exempt
well
as
this
in
the
central
offices
of
chain
store
system.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
doesn't
say
a
central
warehouse.
it
just
says
exempt
warehouses.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
chain
stores
don't
have
wholesale
option
to
do
here
except
as
a
--
as
they
have
goods
that
they
may
distribute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
having
the
whole
history
of
this
act
from
its
beginning
then
that
they
made
a
difference
between
one
retail
store
intended
to
make
it
throughout
and
a
whole
system
whether
you
call
them
chain
warehouses
or
chain,
whatever
you
call
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
has
the
center
idea
in
their
different
treatment
of
the
chain
stores
you've
indicated,
engage
in
wholesale
or
has
been
the
fact
that
they
were
a
large
chain
system,
necessarily
had
the
things
moving
from
state
to
state.
and
they
will
get
the
part
of
--
in
the
act
that
--
where
--
where
it
was
most
--
where
it
hit
it
the
strongest.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
phase
where
they
have
one
place
where
a
lot
of
things
are
done
by
people
in
distributing
goods
in
a
large
way
from
chain
--
from
store
to
store.
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
safeway
for
instance,
i'm
--
i'm
trying
to
get
this,
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what's
your
argument
is,
right?
boat
safeway
for
instance
had
several
stores
in
the
locality
around
here,
retail
as
you
go
in
by
doing
such
as
this.
but
there
was
one
building
where
they
give
you
more
for
--
or
where
i
think
that
they
are
goods
that
we're
going
to
be
distributed
to
these
stores.
would
this
warehouse
in
your
judgment
be
subject
to
their
act
of
a
chain
store
system
like
safeway?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know,
but
they'll
be
exempt,
that's
what
i'm
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
this
--
supposed
this
--
the
division
was
the
whole
of
the
city
of
washington
and
there
are
15
retail
stores,
probably
more
than
that.
we
have
one
of
these
types
of
chain
or
safeway
had
done.
one
of
them,
they
use
more
for
priority
purposes
and
because
he
came
in
and
out,
would
you
consider
it
a
part
or
would
you
say
that
safeway
could
say
that
the
whole
thing
is
just
one
retial
establishment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
physically
removed
from
the
four
other
places?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
safeway
had
four
places
located
precisely
in
those
(inaudible)
and
behind
one
of
them,
and
a
few
feet
of
it,
they
had
a
warehouse.
what
would
you
say
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
if
it
served
all
of
those
four,
four
stores?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
four
stores
but
you
were
saying
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
were
saying
--
that
--
that's
what
i
have
thought
i
was
saying
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i
want
to
get
--
i
want
to
get
to
my
mind
what's
your
argument
is
if
the
--
if
there
were
four
retail
stores,
you
would
say
there
were
four
different
retail
outlets.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
four
different
establishments?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
have
four
retail
stores
or
the
establishment,
whatever
they
are,
i
gathered
from
what
you
said
about
the
regulation
to
the
department.
justice
hugo
l.
black
each
one
--
in
each
one,
a
retail
place
where
you
let
customers
come
in?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
--
how
many
do
the
customers
have,
just
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
--
that's
the
argument
you
make.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
that's
your
--
that's
your
contention.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
--
that's
the
distinction,
the
basic
distinction
between
here
and
the
safeway.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
does
that
happen?
