mr.
smith,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
are
you
reading
--
where
are
you
reading
from?
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
your
brief?
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
do
you
mean
my
“self-sustaining
establishment,”
each
--
each
one
of
them
is
self-sustaining?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
when
i'm
losing
money,
does
--
they
may
have
to
make
it
up
or
do
they
--
you
just
lose
money,
doesn't
it?
and
it
goes
in
to
the
--
the
loss
is
carried
in
to
the
--
the
operations
of
the
entire
company?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
the
self-sustaining?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
lately,
it's
changed.
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
one
of
the
managers
of
one
of
these
supermarkets
be
in
much
the
same
position?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
know
anything
about
the
business
but
it's
--
it's
a
pretty
sized
full
operation
and
i'm
just
wondering
if
it
wouldn't
be
in
pretty
much
the
same
position
as
--
as
one
of
your
units.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
smith,
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
suppose
you
had
--
had
no
districts
at
all
and
all
of
your
warehouses
were
under
one
management.
and
you
had
one
of
them
that
it
was
like
the
alameda,
why,
would
you
be
subject
to
the
act
in
alameda?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
would
you
have
the
same
--
would
you
have
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
would
your
position
be
the
same
here,
in
this
case
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
--
if
you
had
known
this?
well
now,
why
not?
that's
the
thing
--
that's
the
thing
that
bothers
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
any
divisions
where
--
where
you
have
warehouses
in
more
than
one
city?
chief
justice
earl
warren
comprising
one
district
or
one
division?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
far
apart
mr.
smith
are
the
various
warehouses
in
this
particular
division?
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
me
ask
this
mr.
smith,
is
there
no
factor
of
convenience
to
the
public
there
as
to
where
these
warehouses
are
situated
or
convenience
for
your
business
when
they're
situated
a
mile
and
a
half
or
two
miles
and
a
half
apart
in
a
--
in
a
rather
extended
area?
or
is
it
just
because
those
are
the
places
you
could
buy
land
the
cheapest
and
--
and
you
couldn't
--
you
couldn't
buy
land
that's
cheaper
around
your
original
warehouse
and
so
you've
gone
to
these
other
places,
is
that
the
only
factor
or
--
or
is
it
the
factor
also
that
--
that
you're
carrying
it
to
the
--
to
the
public
so
that
they
don't
have
so
far
to
transport
their
goods
if
they
live
in
one
part
of
the
city
and
not
--
not
so
far
as
they
live
in
another?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i'm
--
i'm
not
talking
about
your
inconvenience.
i'm
talking
about
the
principle
on
which
you
establish
these
--
these
warehouses
in
different
parts
of
--
of
the
city
of
los
angeles,
is
--
is
there
a
question
of
convenience
to
the
public
and
yourselves
doing
business
in
addition
to
the
fact
of
just
expanding
where
you
can
more
easily
expand
one
unit?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
don't
they
bring
their
goods
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
store
them
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
at
the
warehouse?
chief
justice
earl
warren
ms.
margolin.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you,
ms.
margolin.
