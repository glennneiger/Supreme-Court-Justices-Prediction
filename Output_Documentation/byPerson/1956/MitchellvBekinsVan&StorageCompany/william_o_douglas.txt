well,
let's
say
we're
originally
separate
establishments,
could
a
mere
change
in
the
method
by
which
they
were
operated
or
managed
or
as
to
their
bookkeeping
or
that
the
central
record
keeping
with
an
alameda
and
such,
could
those
changes
in
operations
of
themselves
change
the
character
of
each
of
them,
so
it's
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--no
longer
a
separate
establishment?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
i
--
i
had
the
impression.
did
i
misunderstand
you
that
each
of
these
new
outlets
or
warehouses
was
located
where
it
was
to
put
that
warehouse
where
the
business
was
since
the
business
in
the
sense
of
residential
business
had
moved
away
from
the
alameda
areas?
