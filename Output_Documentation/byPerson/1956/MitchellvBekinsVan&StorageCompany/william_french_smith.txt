mr.
william
french
smith
if
the
court
please.
respondent
in
this
case
is
primarily
engaged
in
the
business
of
moving
and
storing
household
goods.
we've
been
referred
to
here
as
a
multi-unit,
multi-function
business
and
i
suppose
in
one
sense
we
are
but
we
certainly
are
not
with
respect
to
the
--
the
manner
in
which
petitioner
is
referring
to
it.
we
do
move
commercial
businesses,
we
move
stores,
we
handle
and
store
office
equipment,
used
furniture
and
that
sort
of
thing.
we
are
organized
into
12
divisions
in
and
about
the
los
angeles
area,
19
throughout
the
state.
we
are
not
contending
here
that
the
entire
business
is
an
establishment
as
was
done
in
the
case
of
phillips.
we
are
perfectly
willing
to
concede
that
each
one
of
those
19
divisions
constitutes
an
establishment.
in
this
particular
case,
out
of
the
12
divisions
in
the
los
angeles
area,
there
is
one,
the
east
los
angeles
division
that
has
5
warehouses.
it
is
that
division
which
is
an
issue
here.
it
is
one
building,
the
alameda
building,
which
is
questioned
here
by
petitioner.
i
was
a
little
surprised
to
find
for
the
first
time
that
she
is
creating
the
implication
possibly
that
the
government
contends
that
any
of
these
other
warehouses
or
divisions
is
not
exempt
by
this
act
because
the
findings
of
fact
themselves
specifically
state
the
first
finding,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
plaintiff
does
not
contend,
the
plaintiff
being
the
government,
that
any
of
defendant's
warehouses
either
in
the
los
angeles
area
or
elsewhere
failed
to
meet
such
test.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
at
the
trial
it
was
specifically
stated
by
counsel
for
the
government
that
there
was
no
contention.
they
conceded
in
effect
that
each
one
of
these
other
divisions
was
exempt
as
a
retail
and
service
establishment.
we
have
proceeded
on
that
basis.
i
think
it's
quite
clearly
of
the
case.
so
we
are
talking
about
just
one
building.
i
would
say
that
despite
the
constant
use
of
the
petitioner
in
their
brief
to
such
terms
as
huge
enterprise,
a
large
interstate
multi-function,
multi-unit
business,
that
those
terms
would
equally
apply
to
anyone
of
the
other
divisions
and
anyone
of
the
other
warehouses
which
are
not
contended
to
be
non-exempt.
if
those
contingents
were
--
contentions
were
relevant
to
the
determination
with
respect
to
alameda,
they
would
be
equally
relevant
with
respect
to
every
one
of
the
other
divisions,
the
way
we
see
it.
now,
with
respect
to
the
stipulation,
we
take
strong
exception
to
the
fact
that
we
have
admitted
that
there
are
any
retail
or
any
wholesale
sales
at
alameda.
what
we
stipulated
to
was
that
we
failed
to
meet
the
test
proscribed
by
section
13
(a)
(2)
to
meet
the
exemption.
now,
one
of
those
tests
is
the
fact
that
we
have
to
have
less
than
50%
of
our
sales
within
the
state.
well,
it
so
happens
that
--
at
alameda
we
have
a
good
many
sales
or
services.
however,
this
can
be
designated
which
go
out
of
state.
well,
now
merely
because
they
go
across
state
lines
doesn't
mean
that
they
are
wholesale
certainly
and
i
might
also
say
this
with
respect
to
one
or
two
matters
that
we've
referred
to
in
the
brief
that
congress
has
specifically
stated,
referring
to
roland
electric
company
that
a
sale
to
a
business
user
doesn't
lose
its
characteristic
of
being
a
retail
sale
merely
because
it's
to
a
business
user.
and
i
would
be
delighted
if
the
court
would
look
at
--
look
at
some
of
the
legislative
history
was
--
with
respect
to
that
point.
it's
replete.
mr.
william
french
smith
the
stipulation
is
in
the
transcript,
your
honor.
and
on
page
34.
mr.
william
french
smith
you'll
note
that
at
the
end
of
the
second
finding
we
state
that
such
tests
are
not
met
in
the
case
of
the
alameda
warehouse
considered
separately,
but
i
would
like
to
hasten
to
add,
if
i
may,
that
i
think
the
whole
question
is
immaterial
anyway
for
this
simple
reason.
the
question
of
our
size,
our
interstate
activity,
whether
we
engage
in
wholesale
or
retail
functions
has
to
do
either
with
coverage,
and
that's
not
the
question
here,
or
it
has
to
do
with
whether
or
not
these
tests
are
met.
that
is
not
an
issue
here
because
we
have
stipulated
that
the
tests
are
met.
if
the
division
is
the
establishment,
they
are
not
in
the
case
of
the
alameda
warehouse
so
all
of
these
considerations
are
totally,
in
our
opinion,
irrelevant
to
the
determination
of
this
issue.
size,
interstate
activity,
wholesale
versus
retail,
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
case
if
i
may
say
so.
one
other
item
which
is
referred
to
and
i
--
i'm
using
this
approach
because
i
think
it's
necessary
to
point
out
what
is
not
an
issue
in
order
to
get
to
what
is
an
issue.
petitioner
has
in
other
cases
and
in
our
opinion
correctly
referred
to
the
humanitarian
nature
of
this
act
and
concludes
from
that
as
has
this
court
that
the
act
should
be
liberally
extended
insofar
as
coverage
is
concerned
and
that
the
exemptions
should
be
strictly
construed.
we
can
agree
and
concede
with
that
position.
i'd
like
to
point
out
here,
however,
that
i
know
--
i'd
know
--
and
i
would
be
very
much
surprised
if
petitioner
knows
whether
or
not
more
employees
would
be
covered
if
petitioner's
position
were
accepted
or
if
our
position
were
accepted.
we
have
a
simple
question
of
defining
a
naked
word
"establishment."
there
are
no
humanitarian
considerations
involved
in
that
case
at
all.
and
i
might
point
out
as
an
example
referring
to
a
case
that
i
will
get
to
later,
tobin
versus
aibel,
where
the
government
itself,
that
is
the
wage
and
hour
division,
with
respect
to
interpreting
this
very
word
"establishment"
which
it
had
used
in
one
of
its
orders
took
the
position
that
the
word
included
two
separate
physical
locations
in
one
unit.
now,
that
position
was
adopted
which
is
our
position
here.
the
result
of
the
adopting
of
that
position
there
was
that
those
employees
were
included
within
the
coverage
of
the
act.
it
so
happens
that
here
it's
the
same
position
which
the
government
took
there
were
adopted
they
would
not
be.
now,
how
many
tobin
versus
aibel
situations
there
are
and
how
many
bekins
van
and
storage
situations
there
are,
i
don't
think
anybody
knows.
so,
we
don't
know
whether
the
position
that
the
government
is
taking
here
would
include
more
employees
or
fewer
employees.
it's
quite
possible
that
the
position
that
we
are
taking
here
would
be
the
one
which
would
include
more
employees
countrywide.
our
position
with
respect
to
the
very
simple
question
involved
here
what
does
establishment
mean,
is
simply
this,
we
say
that
in
deciding
that
question
we
have
to
look
at
all
of
the
factors
that
are
involved,
all
the
facts
in
the
case.
there
are
many
factors
which
bear
upon
that
question.
we
say
that
not
the
least
among
those
factors
is
customary
in
an
ordinary
business,
organization,
operation,
and
practice.
we
say
that
an
establishment
must
be
a
unit
which
has
some
operational
or
functional
identity
and
significance.
it
has
to
be,
in
our
opinion,
something
more
than
just
a
plain
physical
location.
we
say
the
government
denies
it.
at
least
i
assume
that
they
deny
it
that
their
position
is
based
upon
physical
location
alone.
we
say
that
they
are
taking
that
one
factor,
which
is
certainly
relevant
to
this
determination,
out,
separating
it
from
all
of
the
other
factors
and
saying
this
alone
must
control.
we
say
that
is
not
a
practical
test
at
all
and
we
think
that
the
facts
in
this
case
amply
demonstrate
that.
here
we
have
a
building
in
which
11
employees
work.
the
top
classification
of
employee
is
the
working
foreman.
they
do
work
which
is
directly
related
to
on-the-spot
storing
and
directly
related
incidental
activities,
paperwork
and
so
on.
all
of
the
management,
executive,
and
administrative
functions
are
performed
on
a
division
not
a
building
basis.
for
example,
all
records
are
kept
on
a
division
basis
including
payroll
records.
there
is
no
one
who
is
responsible
for
the
operation
of
the
alameda
warehouse
alone.
all
responsibility
is
on
a
division
basis.
all
the
dispatching,
all
of
the
orders
are
done
on
a
division
basis,
all
the
sales
functions.
there's
no
territory
that's
divided
up
with
respect
to
each
separate
warehouse
or
building,
nor
is
there
a
--
an
area
of
division
with
respect
to
storage
assignments.
this
is
just
a
plain
building.
the
alameda
warehouse
doesn't
sell
anything
to
anybody.
that
is
all
done
on
a
division
basis.
now,
there
are
some
occasional
exemptions
as
we're
presuming
when
somebody
walks
down
the
street
and
they
have
something
to
store
they
drop
in
and
say,
"will
you
do
it?"
well,
naturally
the
answer
is
yes
but
then
it
is
properly
referred
down
to
the
division
office
where
everything
else
is
handled
the
dispatching
and
so
on.
there's
a
single
system
of
accounts.
one
financial
statement,
one
bank
statement,
supplies
and
purchases,
all
on
a
division
basis,
repairs
and
maintenance,
all
on
a
division
basis.
contrary
to
what
petitioner
has
stated,
the
working
force
is
interchangeable.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
which
would
support
the
idea
that
a
crew
has
an
identity
with
respect
to
each
individual
building.
the
record
shows
this
and
nothing
more
that
they
are
regularly
and
frequently
transferred
from
one
building
to
another.
very
often
when
they
have
a
big
job,
they
will
pull
everybody
out
of
all
of
the
warehouses
and
they'll
do
a
particular
function
here,
there
or
someone
at
somewhere
else.
there's
a
single
union
contract
that
covers
everybody.
the
senior
--
the
seniority
provisions
of
that
contract
are
equally
applicable
on
a
division-wide
basis
or
larger.
now,
i
submit
that
on
the
basis
of
those
facts,
the
facts
in
this
case,
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
contend
that
alameda
has
any
other
identity
except
as
a
separate
physical
location.
it
has
no
significance
as
a
separate
business
unit
of
any
kind.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
findings
of
fact
specifically
state
that
the
business
could
be
carried
on
as
well
or
better
if
all
of
the
warehouses
were
in
one
single
location.
now,
i
might
point
out
that
the
petitioner,
in
response
to
a
question
by
mr.
justice
brennan
with
respect
to
the
five
buildings
side-by-side,
answered
that
question
by
saying
that
they
would
be
separate
establishments
but
why?
because
in
the
cases
that
she
has
in
mind,
they
refer
to
retail
situations.
well,
if
we
had
a
retail
situation
at
this
building
at
alameda
then
i
doubt
very
much
that
we
would
be
here
but
we
don't
have.
and
you
will
note
that
all
of
the
judges
below
had
pointed
out
but
we
doubt
very
much
that
the
government
would
take
this
position
that
all
five
warehouses
were
lined
up
side-by-side.
in
--
in
sum
and
substance,
the
division
is
the
only
retailing
entity
which
we
have
here.
the
findings
of
fact
again
point
out
that
although
the
company
has
considered
decentralizing,
and
that
is
their
policy
to
decentralize
as
far
as
possible,
they
cannot
decentralize
this
east
los
angeles
division
without
sacrificing
efficiency,
cost,
and
flexibility
which
they
have
to
have
in
order
to
operate
that
division.
so,
petitioner's
position,
we
feel,
has
to
be
considered
as
stating
that
physical
location
alone
must
control
this
question.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
court
below
it
was
specifically
stated
that
since
the
phillips
case,
organizational
structure
is
immaterial.
now,
in
our
opinion
this
is
totally
an
impractical
(inaudible).
for
example,
if
we
had
the
typical
situation
where
there
was
one
plant,
everybody
working
on
the
same
floor
under
one
room.
we
have
various
groups
of
employees
headed
by
a
working
foreman,
as
it's
true
in
this
case,
same
records
and
so
on.
we
just
physically
lifted
for
one
reason
or
another
lack
of
space.
that
group
of
employees
in
one
corner
of
the
building,
lifted
them
out,
moved
them
outside,
put
them
down,
put
the
same
--
put
another
roof
over
their
heads,
everything
else
is
exactly
the
same.
i
don't
see
how
petitioner,
considering
the
position
that
it's
taken
in
this
case,
to
say
anything
other
than
that
that
group
thereby
becomes
a
separate
establishment,
the
position
which
we
think
is
untenable.
then
to
complicate
saying,
where
would
the
line
be
drawn?
say
we
have
five
buildings
right
next
to
each
other,
do
they
become
each
a
separate
establishment
or
say
we
move
a
building
across
the
street,
does
that
make
it
a
separate
establishment?
it's
because
as
the
city
puts
through
one-way
streets
and
takes
three
blocks
to
get
to
the
building
across
the
street,
does
that
make
any
difference
and
so
on.
we
say
that
under
the
circumstances
that
cannot
be
any
practical
test
at
all.
mr.
william
french
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
french
smith
would
you
like
to
hear
them
now
or
--
mr.
william
french
smith
well,
basically
it's
this.
i
--
i'm
--
i'm
going
to
cover
that
point.
it's
this.
this
particular
building,
alameda,
was
built
over
50
years
ago
in
1898.
at
that
time
in
los
angeles
it
was
a
residential
area.
during
the
intervening
half
century
it
has
completely
changed
and
now
the
alameda
area
is
surrounded
by
industrial
--
an
industrial
area,
an
industrial
zone
entirely.
now,
we
brought
that
out
to
ourselves
to
show
the
change.
the
reasons
for
--
for
the
change
in
our
operation
has
nothing
to
do
with
alameda
as
such.
i
think
that
petitioner
in
our
brief
and
otherwise
has
come
to
the
conclusion
that
that
change
means
that
the
type
of
people
that
are
served
in
alameda
are
now
commercial.
that
isn't
the
case
at
all.
in
the
early
days,
the
--
the
alameda
warehouse
would
have
served
the
people
in
the
immediate
area,
but
that
has
changed
now.
the
result
is
that
at
the
present
time
alameda
is
nothing
more
than
space.
it
has
no
significance
to
its
local
surroundings
at
all
except
that
-
that
there's
a
railway
--
railroad
track
to
it
but
there's
also
railroad
tracks
to
one
other
in
this
los
angeles
division
(inaudible)
in
the
system,
so
that
the
change
is
significant
because
it
has
changed
the
nature
of
the
business
in
the
east
los
angeles
area.
for
example,
we
now
move
a
--a
law
office
let's
say.
well,
we
can't
move
a
law
office
with
just
the
people
at
one
warehouse.
we
may
have
to
take
a
few
from
here,
a
few
from
there
and
so
on.
and
the
change
in
the
type
of
business
that
the
division
does
requires
the
flexibility
and
fluidity
which
we
have
here,
that
we
--
that
we
have
to
have
in
east
los
angeles
division.
we
couldn't
do
it,
for
example,
if
alameda
alone
were
the
establishment
or
the
unit.
we
wouldn't
have
enough
--
it
wouldn't
have
enough
flexibility.
so,
the
change
in
the
surroundings
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
type
of
business
that
alameda
as
such
conducts,
nor
the
type
of
customers.
but
as
i
say
again,
i
--
we
will
define
the
wholesale
versus
retail
function
as
being
entirely
irrelevant
to
the
--
the
decision
in
this
case.
the
only
test
we
think
is
--
which
is
a
reasonable
one
is
one
which
is
--
the
one
that
we
had
found
in
the
law
frequently,
namely,
we
look
at
the
whole
picture.
all
of
the
facts
and
then
come
to
the
conclusion.
that's
done
into
any
number
of
instances
in
determining
whether
or
not
that
person
is
an
independent
contractor
or
an
employee.
all
of
where
the
facts
fall
as
in
every
case
differ.
you
have
to
look
at
everything,
decide
after
looking
at
the
whole
picture
what
is
the
right
answer.
now,
we're
not
without
legislative
aids
in
this
respect.
i
think
that
section
13
(a)
(2),
the
section
in
question,
contains
within
itself
the
answer
to
this
question,
if
nothing
else
to
it,
that
section
talks
about,
any
employee
employed
by
any
retail
or
service
establishment.
well,
i
submit
that
employees
are
not
employed
by
buildings.
they're
employed
by
business
units.
i
think
when
it
uses
that
term
"by"
it
must
have
some
reference
to
a
customary
or
ordinary
business
unit.
again
and
perhaps
even
more
telling
is
the
term
in
that
section
which
says,
establishments,
it
referred
to
establishment's
annual
dollar
volume
of
sales
of
goods
or
services.
well
now,
how
can
that
figure
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
a
building?
we
don't
even
have
records
for
the
alameda
building
that
would
talk
about
annual
dollar
volumes
of
sales.
i
doubt
very
much
if
we
could
determine
exactly
what
the
annual
dollar
volumes
of
sales
were
with
respect
to
that
building.
we
have
no
records.
the
records
are
in
no
way
broken
down
to
refer
to
one
building
or
another
building
that's
distinguished
from
the
whole
division.
secondly
or
thirdly
rather,
it
refers
to
sales
of
goods
or
services.
we
don't
have
sales
at
alameda.
there's
no
retailing
function
carried
on
there
at
all.
the
retailing
unit,
the
--
the
point
where
customer
contact
is
made
is
at
the
division
office
itself.
now
again,
with
respect
to
the
legislative
history,
the
reference
was
made
that
i
have
taken
out
a
quotation
rather
seriously
out
of
context.
i
feel
this
is
the
quotation
on
page
24
which
is
in
the
legislative
history
with
respect
to
section
13
(a)
(2).
i
would
say
first
that
i
think
this
quotation
stands
on
its
own
feet
quite
aside
from
context,
but
i
would
go
one
step
beyond
that
and
say
that
i
would
be
delighted
if
the
court
would
refer
to
the
entire
legislative
history
dealing
with
this
section.
mr.
william
french
smith
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
william
french
smith
if
the
court
please,
i
believe
that
when
we
concluded
yesterday
afternoon
that
i
had
stated
that
this,
in
our
viewpoint,
the
issue
before
the
court
was
simply
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
term
“establishment”
and
that
was
quite
divorced
from
any
issue
with
respect
to
bigness
or
littleness,
wholesale
or
retail,
or
humanitarian
considerations.
it's
just
a
very
simple
question.
what
does
this
one
term
mean?
our
position,
of
course,
as
i
stated,
is
that
we
feel
there
are
many
factors
which
bear
upon
this
question
not
the
least
of
which
is
the
customary
and
ordinary
business
practice
organization
and
function,
and
we
feel
that
an
establishment
must
contain
at
least
some
organizational,
functional
and
business
identity
and
significance.
the
position
of
the
petitioner,
here,
is
simply
as
we
see
it,
nothing
more
that
--
than
that
any
separate
physical
location
where
work
is
done
constitutes
an
establishment.
we
feel
that
that
is
--
is
an
entirely
impracticable
test
and
could
not
realistically
be
applied.
and
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
go
into
that
in
some
detail.
take
for
example
a
situation
where
a
company
may
build
a
15-story
building
in
which
it
does
its
business.
another
company,
instead
of
having
15
stories,
has
15
separate
buildings
ramps
all
located
on
one
lot
or
perhaps
gathered
above
the
city.
it
doesn't
make
much
difference.
in
each
of
those
15
buildings,
there,
is
work
being
done
and
each
one,
of
course,
is
a
separate
physical
location.
under
the
position
of
the
petitioner
here,
that
would
mean
that
one
company,
otherwise,
identical
would
have
one
establishment
under
the
petitioner's
regulations.
the
other
would
have
15
establishments,
the
sole
and
only
difference
being
the
separate
physical
location.
or
take
another
example,
we
have
a
welder
who
has
--
who
does
welding
work
and
sparks
why,
therefore,
we
want
to
put
him
out
in
a
shed
behind
the
main
building
or
in
the
next
lot
or
down
the
street
of
ways.
one
employee
in
one
shed,
separate
physical
location,
the
work
being
done
in
that
shed
could
have
possibly
be
said
that
that
employee
was
employed
by
that
shed
within
the
meaning
of
section
13
(a)
(2).
could
have
possibly
be
said
that
that
shed
has
annual
dollar
volumes
of
sales
or
services?
we
submit
that
congress
could
never
have
intended
any
such
result
as
that
or
we
can
complicate
them
out
a
little
further
to
say
that
one
employee
works
49%
of
the
time
in
the
shed
and
51%
of
the
time
in
the
main
building.
does
that
affect
the
status
of
a
shed
being
an
establishment
or
we
have
more
than
one
employee
in
that
shed,
three
or
four?does
the
average
amount
of
time
determine
whether
or
not
the
shed
or
the
main
building
is
the
establishment?
or
we
could
have
a
series
of,
let's
say,
cold
storage
warehouses,
little
places
that
are
located
about
the
city
with
one
employee
who
goes
around
and
makes
daily
visits
to
these
various
storage
warehouses.
in
each
case,
we
have
a
separate
physical
location
and
work
being
done
there
as
each
one
a
separate
establishment.
if
it
is,
to
what
establishment
does
that
employee
belong?
we
could
carry
these
illustrations
on
and
on,
but
i
think
they
are
very
important
because
they
show
what
the
courts
are
going
to
be
faced
with
from
hereon
in
if
this
is
the
kind
of
a
test
which
is
established.
in
addition
to
section
13
(a)
(2)
itself,
as
providing
guideposts
to
determine
this
question,
we
also
have
some
legislative
history.
there's
a
good
deal
of
legislative
history,
of
course,
that
preceded
the
1949
amendments.
there
is
some
with
respect
to
this
particular
problem.
and
i
would
like
just,
if
i
may,
to
read
because
the
quotations
can
express
it
a
lot
better
than
i
can.
in
the
first
place,
senator
holland,
who
was
the
sponsor
of
this
amendment
in
the
senate
stated
among
other
things.
mr.
william
french
smith
this
is
on
page
24.
mr.
william
french
smith
24
of
our
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
william
french
smith
24,
respondent's
brief.
the
congress
used
the
terms
“retail”
and
“service
establishments”
in
their
customary
meaning,
in
their
customary
application
as
they
were
customarily
understood
in
the
various
industries
of
the
nation.
that
certainly
shows
that
the
type
of
business
consideration
that
i
am
referring
to
here
was
in
the
minds
of
congress
when
this
amendment
was
passed
because
i
think
it
would
have
had
to
have
been.
in
addition
to
that,
there
are
indications
that
simple
physical
location
is
not
to
be
a
controlling
test
in
the
house
manager
statement.
there
is
an
excerpt
that
which
appears
on
the
same
page
of
this
brief
which
says,
since
however,
the
exemption
does
apply
to
any
employee
employed
by
an
exempt
retail
or
service
establishment,
it
is
applicable
to
employees
of
an
exempt
retail
or
service
establishment
working
in
a
warehouse,
operated
by
and
servicing
such
establishment
exclusively,
whether
or
not
the
warehouse
operation
is
conducted
in
the
same
building
as
the
selling
or
servicing
activities.
now,
i
submit
that
that
doesn't
require
any
context
in
determining
its
applicability
to
this
situation.
even
if
it
did,
i
don't
believe
that
the
context
would,
at
all,
change
the
basic
meaning
of
that
quotation.one
other
thing,
which
i
think
is
of
interest
too,
and
that
is
that
this
court
in
the
phillips
case,
in
a
footnote,
referred
to
the
legislative
history,
originally
that
is,
where
it
was
proposed
of
the
term
“industry”
be
substituted
for
the
term
“establishment”
really
as
vice
versa.
the
original
proposal
was
that
instead
of
having
a
retail
establishment,
we
have
a
retail
industry.
that
term
was
deleted
and
the
establishment
was
substituted
forth.
that
was
pointed
out
in
some
length
in
petitioner's
brief
before
this
court
in
the
phillips
case
and
as
i
say
it
was
referred
to
by
the
court
in
the
--
its
opinion.
now,
that
shows
certainly
that
congress
was
thinking
about
the
larger
side
of
the
term
establishment,
not
the
smaller
side.
they
were
talking
about
some
--
something,
somewhere
between
industry
and
the
term
establishment.
if
congress
had
been
talking
about
a
building
or
something
as
--
something
as
detailed
and
small,
you
might
say
is
that,
certainly,
congress
would
have
found
some
other
words
to
express
themselves
than
it
was
done
here.
i
think
it
is
also
interesting
to
note
that
petitioner
itself
has
taken
a
different
position
in
other
cases.
i
have
already
referred
to
the
case
of
tobin
versus
aibel,
where
the
petitioner
took
the
position
of
two
separate
locations
constituted
at
one
establishment.
in
that
case,
under
their
own
order,
issue
of
pursuant
to
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
they
had
used
the
term
that
there
was
coverage
where
goods
were
partially
or
completely
manufactured
in
the
same
establishment
because
that
where
the
knitting
process
is
performed.
there
we
had
a
one
physical
location
where
these
hair
nets,
or
whatever
they
were,
were
made
another
where
they
were
distributed.
they
were
two
separate
legal
identities
--
entities,
i
should
say.
one
was
the
corporation,
the
other,
partnership.
petitioner,
there,
took
the
position
that
both
of
those
two
together
should
constitute
one
establishment.
we
agreed.
that's
our
position
here.
we
think
that
in
that
case,
petitioner
would
have
been
in
a
much
stronger
position
to
have
urged
that
the
one
--
one
separate
physical
location
constituted
the
establishment
rather
than
both.
we
suggest
that
the
position
that
they
took
there
should
be
applied
here.
i
think
it
is
also
--
mr.
william
french
smith
the
reference
i
think
there
is,
your
honor,
to
the
question
of
chain
stores.
mr.
william
french
smith
and
i
think
--
and
i,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
will
very
readily
admit
and
be
most
happy,
too,
that
the
congress
during
the
time
of
the
1949
amendment
were
being
considered,
specifically
approved
the
phillips
case.
and
i
think
that
this
particular
quotation
here,
which
comes,
first
talks
about
regular
chain
store
systems.
we
make
no
contention
that
that
quotation
is
erroneous
in
any
way.
in
other
words,
we
think
that
what
--
what
congress
was
doing
here
was
to
say
that
what
this
court
said
in
phillips
was
correct.
in
other
words,
where
you
do
have
a
regular
chain
store
situation
and
i
understand
the
chain
store
situation
to
be
where
you
have
a
series
of
outlets,
retail
outlets,
but
then,
in
addition
to
that,
you
have
manufacturing,
processing,
and
distribution
functions
which
they're
all
funneled,
of
course,
ultimately
to
those
retail
outlets.
mr.
william
french
smith
some
of
them
do,
yes,
your
honor.
and
a
number
of
cases
have
been
before
this
court
have
had.bakeries,
for
example,
manufacturing
and
processing
and
i
think
--
i
think,
as
a
matter
of
general
knowledge,
i
will
say,
i
think
that
a
number
of
the
larger
chains
do
--
do
have
manufacturing
plants
that
actually
make
the
goods
that
are
distributed
to
the
retail
outlets.
mr.
william
french
smith
well,
we
haven't
made
any
great
point
out
of
the
factors.
our
organization
is
not
a
chain
store.
we
don't
believe
it
is.
we
have
19
separate
divisions.
each
one
of
those
divisions
could
be
independently
owned
but
each
one
is
self-sustaining.
there
is
nothing
that
is
done
by
a
central
warehouse
or
a
central
office
system
at
all
that
has
any
function
or
relation
to
each
one
of
these
19
divisions.
the
19
divisions
constitute
a
warehousing
function
in
and
of
themselves.
in
other
words,
everything
that
is
done
in
connection
with
the
warehousing
function
is
done
entirely
within
that
division.
there
is
nothing
which
is
done,
let's
say
higher
up,
which
is
funneled
down
into,
or
otherwise,
concerns
each
of
these
divisions
except
this
one
thing
and
that
it's
--
mr.
william
french
smith
their
only
interrelation,
your
honor,
is
in
top
management.
in
other
words,
top
management
has
only
one
interest
in
each
of
these
divisions
and
that
is
results.
do
they
or
do
--
do
they
not
make
a
profit?
that
is
the
one
interest.
there
is
no
other
--
that
--
sir?
mr.
william
french
smith
no,
sir.
mr.
william
french
smith
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
french
smith
that
is
--
that
is
exactly
right,
your
honor,
and
i
might
say,
if
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
competition
between
them,
not
competition
with
respect
to
areas,
but
competition
among
the
various
managers
to
see
who
can
come
out
the
best,
you
might
say.
mr.
william
french
smith
i
--
i
don't
believe
that
they
would,
your
honor,
in
the
same
sense
that
we're
talking
about
it
here.
chains
--
mr.
william
french
smith
well
ultimately,
ultimately.
mr.
william
french
smith
well,
yes.
i
think
it's
--
it
is
true
that
the
--
that
the
top
management,
of
course,
establish
its
general
policies
that
would
govern
each
one
of
the
divisions.
mr.
william
french
smith
well,
i
think
your
honor
that
a
chain
store
does
something
more
than
that.
mr.
william
french
smith
well,
i
think
a
chain
store,
as
i
say,
engages
into
some
extent,
an
actual
manufacturing
and
to
some
extent
in
purchasing,
warehousing,
handling
and
then
distributing
to
each
one
of
the
retail
outlets.
you
see,
there
is
a
definite
--
the
difference
in
function.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
was
what
the
phillips
case
was
all
about.
in
the
phillips
case,
there
was
the
distinction
made
by
this
court
between
the
wholesaling
function
and
the
retailing
function.
this
court
said,
and
in
my
humble
opinion
correctly,
that
a
wholesale
function
does
not
take
on
the
characteristics
of
a
retail
function
merely
because
it
is
operated
by
the
same
business.
that
is
the
heart
and
soul
of
phillips
versus
walling,
just
that.
mr.
william
french
smith
19.
mr.
william
french
smith
well,
they're
all
--
there
are
number
of
divisions
that
are
comprised
of
just
one
warehouse.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
appears
from
the
record
and
i
think
you
probably
generally
well
known
that
--
that,
by
and
large,
the
warehouse
business
is
a
one-warehouse
business.everything
is
one
in
one
word.
mr.
william
french
smith
that's
all
there
is.
mr.
william
french
smith
that's
right.
and
of
course,
the
necessary
functions
for
the
selling
function,
dispatching
orders
and
the
usual
thing,
of
course.
mr.
william
french
smith
yes,
that's
true.
in
other
words,
it's
all
in
one
company
you
see,
but
--
mr.
william
french
smith
that's
right.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
french
smith
no,
sir.
well,
i
can't
be
too
categorical
about
that.
they
transfer
and
take
the
east
los
angeles
division.
there
is
constant
fluidity
among
the
employees
within
that
division.
there
is
not
fluidity
between
that
division
and
any
other
division.
mr.
william
french
smith
well,
there
are
12
divisions
in
the
--
in
the
locale
of
los
angeles,
immediately
in
that
area.
the
remaining
seven
are
throughout
the
state
of
california.
mr.
william
french
smith
yes,
they're
all
--
they're
all
in
california.
and
you
might
say,
in
a
sense,
that
california
is
divided
into
19
areas
but
there
are
12.
and
of
course,
we
are
taking
a
different
position
here
from
the
position
that
was
taken
in
phillips.
in
phillips,
the
position
was
that
the
whole
company,
the
whole
enterprise
was
one
establishment.
we
don't
take
that
position.
we
take
the
position
that
each
one
of
these
divisions,
which
is
a
self-sustaining
unit,
is
an
establishment.
and
as
indicated,
we're
not
--
we're
not
covering
multi-states,
we're
just
covering,
for
example,
in
the
los
angeles
alone,
there
are
12
divisions.
each
one
of
which,
we
--
we
would
concede,
of
course,
that
it's
an
establishment.
mr.
william
french
smith
well,
i'm
--
mr.
william
french
smith
yes,
your
honor.
i
meant
operationally
--
mr.
william
french
smith
well,
i
meant
“operationally
self-sustaining.”
that's
the
term
that
was
used
by
--
in
--
in
the
record
itself.
by
self-sustaining,
i
mean,
if
we
have
a
manager,
we
have
assistant
manager,
dispatcher,
sales
manager
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
for
each
division.
and
each
division
operates
within
the
general
overall
policy
limitations
of
the
company
itself,
on
its
own.
now,
i
suspect
--
mr.
william
french
smith
well,
i
suppose
that
if
--
mr.
william
french
smith
well,
to
some
extent,
it
would
be.
i
mean
in
certain
respects,
it
would
be.
i
suppose
that
if
--
that
if
they
--
the
managers
say
of
a
retail
store
was
constantly
in
the
red,
they're
probably
--
something
would
be
done
about
it,
one
way
or
the
other,
and
i
suspect
the
same
thing
would
be
true
with
respect
to
our
situation.
there
are
certain
similarities
but
i
don't
think
the
similarities
have
any
real
bearing
upon
the
question
that
we
have
here.
the
question
that
we
have
here
is
simply
this,
what
is
establishment?
is
it
a
warehouse
or
is
it
this
division?
now,
the
only
way,
i
submit,
that
you
can
determine
that
question
is
to
look
at
the
relationship
between
the
warehouse
and
the
division.
i
--
i
think
it's
probably
true
to
say
that
there's
no
real
necessity
to
go
outside
the
division
to
even
decide
this
question.
that's
the
only
issue.
in
other
words,
no
issue
has
been
raised
except,
whether
or
not,
alameda,
or
the
division
of
which
alameda
is
a
part
is
the
division.
that's
the
question.
and
we
--
and
our
position
simply
is
that
in
deciding
that
question,
there
has
to
be
some
relation.
we
don't
even
have
to
say
how
much
in
this
case,
there
has
to
be
some
relation
to
some
operational
and
functional
business
identity.
some
business
significance,
otherwise,
the
section
couldn't
operate.
mr.
william
french
smith
well
--
mr.
william
french
smith
well,
your
honor,
you
see,
we
don't
have
a
central
warehouse
or
a
central
office.
in
the
sense
that
a
chain
store
does,
it
is
just
non-existent.
it
isn't
there.
in
other
words,
that
the
--
the
chain
store
warehouse
--
mr.
william
french
smith
well,
it
is
talking
about,
your
honor,
the
situation
where
there
is
one
warehouse
which
serves
a
variety
of
retail
stores.
that's
what
that
quotation
is
talking
about
in
referring
to
a
chain
store
situation.
now,
we
don't
have
that.
we
don't
have
it
at
all.
everything
is
contained
within
the
division
itself,
you
see.
now
phillips,
again,
phillips
--
the
phillips
case,
and
this
sort
of
thing
was
talking
about
the
phillips
case
with
a
situation
where
there
was
a
wholesale
function.
we
don't
have
a
wholesale
function
here
at
all
in
that
sense.
there
has
been
some
efforts
to
compare,
let's
say,
the
--
the
alameda
warehouse
--
mr.
william
french
smith
well,
that's
it,
your
honor.
that's
what
this
court
has
said,
it's
wholesale.
mr.
william
french
smith
yes,
that
--
that
is
certainly
true,
your
honor.
but
that
is
he
wasn't
involved
in
this
case.
that,
as
i
say,
that
goes
to
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
tests
have
been
met
that
there
are
three
tests
set
out
in
13
(a)
(2)
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
a
retail
or
service
establishment,
you
see.
now,
whether
there
is
wholesale
or
retail,
it
goes
to
that
question,
but
that
question
isn't
involved
in
this
case,
you
see.
mr.
william
french
smith
well,
of
course
even
with
respect
to
chain
store
systems,
your
honor,
there's
no
--
there's
no
controversy
about
the
fact
that
retail
outlets
themselves
are
exempted
as
retail
or
service
establishments.
mr.
william
french
smith
that's
right.
now,
we
--
we
are
saying
here,
we're
accepting
that.
there's
no
question
about
it.
the
whole
--
it's
--
it's
only
the
wholesaling
phase
of
a
retail
chain
that
is
--
that
has
been
determined
under
this
section
to
be
a
separate
establishment.
mr.
william
french
smith
exactly,
exactly.
and
what
we
are
saying
here,
your
honor,
is
just
this.
we
say,
that
the
east
los
angeles
division,
which
is
comprised
of
five
buildings
is
the
same
thing
as
a
retail
outlet
in
a
chain
store
system,
if
you
--
if
that
comparison
is
valid
at
all.
say
--
in
other
words,
say
it
is
valid,
say
there
--
there
is
an
appropriate
comparison
between
respondent's
operation
here
and
the
chain
store
system,
then
the
appropriate
and
valid
comparison
would
be
between
a
regular
retail
outlet,
a
retail
store
and
the
east
los
angeles
division
because
it's
the
east
los
angeles
division
which
is
the
retailing
entity,
you
see.
in
other
words,
there
would
be
as
--
accepting
that
comparison,
there
would
be
no
difference
at
all,
comparison
wise
if
you
had
a
retail
store
that
consisted
of
five
buildings.
mr.
william
french
smith
yes.
mr.
william
french
smith
well,
of
course,
there's
no
issue
here
about
being
subject
to
the
act,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe.
in
--
mr.
william
french
smith
--
in
--
in
the
example
you
gave.
mr.
william
french
smith
i
--
i
would
say
in
the
example
which
you
gave
that
--
that
one
warehouse
would
be
a
separate
establishment
because
it
is
servicing
seven
stores,
you
see?
no
question
about
that.
but
i
say
--
i
say
this
that
if
you
have
--
if
you
have
a
retail
store
that
has
five
buildings,
consist
of
five
buildings,
it
doesn't
mean
it's
what
they're
used
for,
they're
just
space,
five
buildings.
let's
say
the
store
of
canned
goods
prior
to
being
put
on
the
shelf
then
the
comparison
here
is
complete
because
that
one
retailing
unit
is
the
retailing
entity
consisting
of
five
stores.
in
our
case,
it's
same
thing.
our
retailing
entity
is
this
east
los
angeles
division
consisting
of
five
buildings.
now,
we
have
the
burns
--
mr.
william
french
smith
no,
sir,
we
wouldn't,
definitely
not.
mr.
william
french
smith
well,
again,
your
honor
if
i
may
say,
there's
no
--
there's
no
problem
here
of
being
subject
to
the
act.
we
concede
that
we're
--
we're
subject
to
the
act.
there's
not
--
that
issue
wasn't
involved
in
this
case
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
william
french
smith
we
have
the
same
situation,
in
other
words,
we'd
be
--
mr.
william
french
smith
probably
not.
mr.
william
french
smith
well,
yes,
why
not.
for
this
reason,
we
are
a
retailing
enterprise.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
petitioner
concedes
that
as
regulations
specifically
says
that
moving
and
storing
of
household
goods
is
a
retail
or
service
enterprise.
that's
--
it's
spelled
out
that
clearly.
now,
being
a
retail
enterprise,
we
have
to
have
contacts
with
the
public,
our
--
our
customer,
their
clients,
you
might
say.
well
now,
where
do
we
have
those
contacts?
a
retail
store
or
a
chain
store
system
has
its
contacts,
its
customer
contacts,
its
retail
customer
contacts
at
the
various
retail
locations,
retail
store,
here,
there,
as
has
been
mentioned
--
let's
say
15
in
the
city
of
washington.
each
one
of
those
15
is
a
separate
establishment
as
far
as
we're
concerned.
i
think
that's
quite
clear,
no
problem.
we
have
19
retail
stores
in
that
sense.
we
have
19
places
where
we
have
contacts
with
the
public
with
our
--
with
our
customers,
where
we
sell
things,
19
places.
when
we
advertise,
we
advertise
19
places
throughout
the
state.
if
you
have
something
to
store,
something
to
move,
call
such
and
such
a
number,
that
number
is
always
the
division
office.
so,
what
we
are
saying
is
that
we
have
19
places
where
we
have
customer
contacts
where
we
sell
things.
now,
we
also
have
36
warehouses
but
we
don't
have
customer
contacts.
we
don't
sell
things
at
those
warehouses.
there's
no
difference
between
a
situation,
for
example,
where
you
have
a
retail
store
and
a
storeroom
behind
it.
and
in
the
storeroom,
you
keep
the
things
that
you're
about
to
sell.
and
as
you
sell
things,
you
go
back
to
the
store
and
you
bring
them
up.
no
question
in
--
on
the
petitioner's
regulations
that
the
whole
thing
is
one
establishment.
no
question
at
all
about
that.
all
right,
now
what
happens?
we
expand,
let's
say,
either
our
sales,
one
of
our
19
divisions
or
retail
store.
the
backroom
is
not
big
enough.
we
have
to
have
more
space.
well,
economic
considerations
as
such
that
we
cannot
just
push
the
walls
out.
we
have
to
get
another
building
somewhere.
so,
we
get
a
building
down
the
street
of
ways,
a
block,
let's
say.
and
we
store
things
there
and
in
the
storeroom
and
as
things
are
sold,
we
go
back
to
the
storeroom
and
to
the
building
down
the
street,
bring
them
back,
put
them
on
the
shelves
and
sell
them.
that
situation,
petitioner
does
not
contend
and
constitutes
two
--
two
establishments.
they
say
that
is
one,
the
burns
case,
a
federal
district
court
case
held
that.
and
as
i
understand
it,
both
of
the
trial
level
and
in
the
--
in
their
brief
here,
petitioner
concedes
that
under
those
circumstances
there
is
just
one
establishment.
now,
the
only
difference
between
that
situation
and
this
situation
is
that
instead
of
having
a
backroom
and
one
subsidiary
backroom
down
the
street,
we
have
four.
that
is
the
only
difference.
we
don't
have
pails,
bottles
and
cans.
we
don't
have
bedroom
sets.
and
therefore,
--
dining
room
sets
and
that
sort
of
things
was
not
too
surprising
that
we
would
need
four
--
four
or
five
times
as
much
space
as
a
--
as
a
--
an
organization
would
--
that
handles
cans
and
bottles.
now,
there's
no
difference
in
those
situations
as
far
as
i
can
see.
mr.
william
french
smith
warehouses
in
more
than
one
city
--
mr.
william
french
smith
well,
there
is
none
in
--
in
the
los
angeles
area,
your
honor.
i'm
not
too
sure
about
other
areas
in
the
state.
i
know
that
there
are
12
--
there
are
12
in
--
the
east
los
angeles
division
is
the
only
one
that
has
five
warehouses.
in
most
cases,
there's
just
one
warehouse
per
division,
just
one
location,
you
see.
now,
it
may
--
it
may
have
15
floors
on
it,
i
don't
know.
and
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
east
--
the
los
angeles
division,
we
would
be
tickled
to
death
if
we
could
have
the
way
things
they
have
now
developed
in
downtown
los
angeles,
have
all
of
these
warehouses
piled
one
on
top
of
the
other
in
the
same
location.
now,
if
that
were
case,
petitioner
wouldn't
permit
and
contend
that
there
was
more
one
establishment.
but
because
we
haven't
been
able
to
do
that
for
economic
reasons,
that
cost
of
land
and
that
sort
of
thing,
because
we
haven't
been
able
to
push
out
the
walls
and
to
get
our
storeroom
space
to
furnish
this
one
retail
outlet,
not
a
series
of
them,
not
15
or
8,
or
1,
because
we
haven't
been
able
to
have
enough
storeroom
to
handle
that.
we've
had
to
go
elsewhere
and
get
it
physically
removed.
the
only
difference
--
in
other
words,
the
space
at
alameda
is
nothing
more
than
a
storeroom
physically
removed
an
extension
of
space,
nothing
more
than
that.
mr.
william
french
smith
physically
removed
from
the
four
other
places.
mr.
william
french
smith
well,
it
would
depend
upon
what
the
warehouse
did,
your
honor.
if
the
warehouse
just
served
that
one
retail
outlet
--
mr.
william
french
smith
well,
you
--
you
see
they
are.
mr.
william
french
smith
well,
that's
--
that's
the
difference,
your
honor.
mr.
william
french
smith
i
think
that's
the
problem.
mr.
william
french
smith
and
four
different
establishments.
mr.
william
french
smith
yes.
mr.
william
french
smith
no,
your
honor
--
mr.
william
french
smith
no,
sir,
no,
sir.
that
is
the
difference.
mr.
william
french
smith
just
one.
mr.
william
french
smith
the
one
on
figueroa.
that
is
the
--
that
is
the
major
difference
in
this
case.
mr.
william
french
smith
yes.
well,
it's
--
it's
not
--
it's
an
argument.
i
mean
if
their
decision
are
facts.
mr.
william
french
smith
well,
they
should
see
the
facts.
mr.
william
french
smith
oh
yes,
oh
yes.
mr.
william
french
smith
in
other
words,
the
--
the
analogy
here,
it
wouldn't
be
between
our
five
warehouses
and
five
safeway
stores
because
in
each
of
one
of
the
five
safeway
stores,
there
is
customer
contact.
they
sell
things
in
each
one
of
those
five
places.
we
don't
sell
things
in
each
one
of
those
five
places.
we
only
sell
things
at
one.
the
other
four
are
simply
used
to
hold
things
until
we're
ready
to
use
them.
that's
the
difference.
mr.
william
french
smith
they
vary
from
one
in
three
quarters
miles
which
is
the
alameda
from
figueroa
to
--
i
think
it's
two
and
three
quarters,
three
miles
or
something
like
that,
roughly
that.
that,
however,
is
based
upon
strictly
historical
considerations.
in
other
words,
at
one
time
and
--
and
this
--
this
again
is
where
i
think
petitioner
has
--
has
perhaps
confused
something.
at
one
time,
each
one
of
these
five
was
the
retail
outlet
for
the
simple
reason
that
at
that
time,
50
years
ago,
and
in
some
cases
more
recently,
these
were
residential
areas.
when
that
--
when
that
warehouse
was
first
put
up,
it
was
the
only
warehouse
the
company
has
and
it
served
that
area.
but
since
that
time,
you
see,
it
is
no
longer
a
residential
area.
it
is
commercial
business
and
everything
else.
but
we
don't
serve
that
commercial
or
business
area
now
because
it
has
changed
and
because
we
are
principally
engaged
in
a
business
of
moving
and
storing
household
goods
that
the
location
of
that
warehouse
has
entirely
lost
its
significance.
it
doesn't
serve
that
area
anymore.
it
doesn't
serve
any
area.
it
is
strictly
a
space
where
we
keep
things,
everything
else
is
handled
at
the
division
office.
and
it's
as
simple
as
that.
as
i
--
mr.
william
french
smith
your
honor,
the
only
inconvenience
is
to
us.
we
--
mr.
william
french
smith
your
honor,
these
warehouses
are
where
they
are
because
of
historical
reasons.
in
other
words,
we
could,
let's
say
build
a
tremendous
building
at
figueroa
if
we
wanted
to
and
we
would
like
it
better
that
way.
but
they
are
where
they
because
they
have
always
been
there
and
it's
not
economical
to
tear
them
down
or
sell
them
and
build
another
building,
you
see.
but
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
convenience
to
the
public
because
the
public
doesn't
deal
through
that
warehouse.
as
far
as
the
public
is
concerned,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
whether
that
warehouse
is
where
it
is
or
at
figueroa
all
in
one
building
you
see,
because
the
public
doesn't
deal
with
that
building.
mr.
william
french
smith
no.
mr.
william
french
smith
no.
mr.
william
french
smith
well,
what
i
should
say
is
this,
if
they
have
--
if
they
have
goods
to
be
picked
up
or
to
be
moved,
we
will
send
out
a
truck
naturally
to
pick
them
up
or
move
them.
now,
if
we
have
a
warehouse
ourselves,
and
after
we
picked
them
up,
of
course,
the
public
isn't
concerned
where
they
go.
in
some
cases,
they
may
be.
they
may
want
to
know
what
warehouse
--
the
particular
their
goods
are
being
stored
at.
but
we
may,
if
we
have
space
and
probably
would,
if
we
had
space
in
that
warehouse
which
was
nearest
to
wherever
this
was,
put
them
in
that
warehouse
merely
because
it
was
a
quicker
place
to
go
to,
you
see.
if
there
was
not
any
space
in
that
warehouse,
we
might
put
them
any
one
of
the
other
four
or
five
warehouses,
you
see.
but
the
--
the
customer
situation
is
nothing
more
than
this.
the
customer
calls
in,
in
most
cases
on
and
almost
with
a
very
high
percentage
of
the
cases
to
figueroa.
that's
where
we
want
them
to
call
in.
they
have
something
to
store
or
move.
we
send
the
truck
out.
we
pick
it
up.
now,
what
happens
after
that
in
the
great
majority
of
the
cases,
the
customer
has
nothing
to
do
with?
the
customer
isn't
there
in
the
matter
of
convenience
to
the
customer
at
all.
the
only
convenience
to
the
customer
is
getting
his
goods
picked
up,
what
happens
--
mr.
william
french
smith
yes,
there
is,
your
honor.
there
is
--
there
is
some
testimony
from
one
of
the
respondent's
witnesses
to
the
effect
that
on
occasion,
a
customer
will
designate
what
warehouse
he
wants
his
goods
to
go
into.
mr.
william
french
smith
and
as
--
mr.
william
french
smith
no,
your
honor,
as
a
matter
fact,
i
--
i
--
as
i
recall
the
testimony
was
that
happens
relatively
and
frequently,
but
it
can
happen.
in
fact
--
apparently,
it
does
happen
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
--
the
record
also
shows
that
the
warehouse
receipt
will
show
what
building
it's
in,
you
see.
but
the
record
also
shows,
and
the
fact
is,
that
if
all
of
these
buildings
were
in
one
building,
we
could
operate
our
business
as
well
or
better
which
is
the
finding
of
facts.
mr.
william
french
smith
no,
sir,
not
at
all.
mr.
william
french
smith
no,
i
didn't
mean
that,
your
honor.
what
i
meant
was
this,
when
--
when
this
company
first
started
in
1898,
they
had
one
building,
it
was
the
alameda
building.
and
that
was
all
they
had,
you
see.
and
at
that
time,
it
was
in
the
residential
area
of
los
angeles
and
it
served
that
area
because
that
was
their
business,
moving
and
storing
of
household
goods,
you
see.
but
then
as
time
went
on,
the
residents
--
the
residential
area
already
changed
and
became
a
heavily
commercial
area,
you
see.
and
when
it
became
a
commercial
area,
the
building
no
longer
had
any
function
because
there
wasn't
anybody
for
it
to
function
on,
you
might
say.
in
other
words,
there
was
no
longer
any
--
any
customers
in
that
area
that
that
this
warehouse
could
serve.
and
that
was
a
gradual
process
and
it
happened
more
or
less
with
the
other
four
warehouses
in
the
division.
there
are
still
are
some
warehouses
that
are
in
substantial
--
substantially
residential
areas.
mr.
william
french
smith
at
the
time,
yes.
at
the
time
that
the
building
was
either
built
or
acquired,
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
serving
a
then
growing
residential
area.
mr.
william
french
smith
well,
as
it
was
--
as
it
was
established,
i
think
probably,
your
honor,
that's
right.
mr.
william
french
smith
it's
--
it's
probably
a
little
difficult
to
say
exactly
when
that
happened
but
the
--
the
east
los
angeles
division
has
been
in
its
present
form
for
about
20
years.
and
the
testimony
is
and
the
findings
in
the
record
are
that
this
change
took
place
with
respect
to
the
whole
east
los
angeles
division.
their
business
still
was
primarily
handling
and
storing
of
household
goods,
and
still
is,
you
see.
but
because
of
the
change
in
the
overall
nature
of
the
division,
the
fact
that
there
were
good
many
commercial
customers,
moving
is
a
loss,
as
that
sort
of
thing
which
incidentally
is
retail.
because
of
that
change,
more
fluidity
was
necessary
in
this
area.
it
was
broken
down,
you
see,
about
20
years
ago
into
the
east
and
west
los
angeles
areas.
mr.
william
french
smith
not
for
the
last
20
years,
your
honor.
mr.
william
french
smith
prior
to
that
time,
i
just
don't
know
and
the
record
doesn't
reveal
it.
i
would
suspect
prior
to
that
time,
the
record
does
show
this
much.
it
shows
that
--
that
the
warehouse
as
when
they
were
first
built
or
acquired
were
following
the
residential
area,
as
you
see.
mr.
william
french
smith
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
william
french
smith
--
so
far
as
i
know,
there
had
been
no
change
in
the
manner
in
which
the
east
los
angeles
division
has
been
carried
on
since
it
has
been
a
division.
it's
been
the
same.
in
other
words,
everything
has
been
done
through
figueroa.
the
whole
point
is
even
all
these
warehouses
may
have
followed
out
and
there
were
some
convenience
to
the
company
as
far
as
picking
goods
up
and
transporting
them
to
a
near
warehouse,
the
fact
still
remains
that
the
retailing
outlet,
the
contact
with
customers
and
everything
else,
bookkeeping
and
so
on,
was
still
carried
on
to
figueroa.
mr.
william
french
smith
well
yes,
your
honor,
but
there's
a
difference
between
that
situation.
i
probably
shouldn't
have
speculated
to
withstand.i
didn't
respect
to
whether
or
not
at
that
time
they
were
or
not
directly
having
customer
contact.
i
assume
when
alameda
was
put
up,
that
was
the
case.
but
there
is
--
there
is
this
difference.
there's
a
difference
between
having
a
building
out
here
where
we
could
take
things,
too,
once
we
have
our
customer
contacts
with
figueroa
and
actually
having
a
customer
contact
situation
or
a
retail
outlet
at
that
warehouse.
now,
there
has
never
been
a
retail
outlet
there
while
that
warehouse
has
been
in
the
east
los
angeles
division,
you
see.
it
is
just
been
nothing
more
than
a
physical
location.
now,
i
--
i
suspect
that
in
some
cases,
it's
convenient
to
have
the
warehouse
where
it
is,
some
cases,
it's
not.
but
in
any
case,
we
would
be
tickled
to
death
to
have
everything
just
in
one
building,
one
place,
one
unit,
and
so
on.
i
think
one
thing
i
wanted
to
point
out
was
the
fact
that
the
--
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
in
the
phillips
case,
the
one
case
that
they
are
--
they
are
relying
upon
took
the
position
very
strongly
that
the
policy
of
the--
and
--
and
i'm
quoting
from
a
statement
in
their
brief
which
appears
in
one
form
or
another
or
rather
frequently,
“the
policy
of
the
act
as
a
whole
strongly
supports
the
accepted
governmental
and
business
meaning
of
the
words.”
now,
that
was
their
position,
their
contention
with
respect
to
what
an
establishment
meant
and
that
was
the
position
which
was
adopted
by
this
court
in
the
phillips
case.
and
--
look
at
this
court
in
the
phillips
case
specifically
stated
congress
used
the
word
establishment
as
it
is
normally
used
in
business
and
in
the
government-as
meaning
a
distinct
physical
place
of
business.
now,
it's
that
phrase
which
i
think
has
caused
the
trouble,
but
that
phrase
has
had
its
genesis
in
the
regulations
of
the
petitioner
itself
where
they
have
stated
to
use
their
term
physically
separated
unit
or
a
branch
in
distinguishing
a
situation
between
the
overall
chain
store
system
and
its
retail
outlet.
thank
you.
mr.
william
french
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
french
smith
i
think
it
is.
mr.
william
french
smith
well
--
mr.
william
french
smith
well,
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
answer
that
this
way.
i
have
gone
to
some
extent
into
the
question
of
the
positions
they've
taken
in
the
past
cases
with
respect
to
what
that
word
means.
the
one
case
they
say
that
controls
this
case
is
the
phillips
case,
phillips
versus
walling.
mr.
william
french
smith
yes,
but
in
that
--
in
that
particular
case,
the
one
position
that
they
were
taking,
of
course,
was
that
government
and
business
practice
should
control.
that's
what
we're
saying
here.
i
say
also
that
they
have
taken
a
position
different
from
the
one
that
they
are
taking
here
in
other
cases.
and
furthermore,
i
say,
that
i
don't
think
that
the
fact
that
the
--
the
petitioner
is
taking
a
position
with
respect
to
the
meaning
of
this
word
here
has
any
great
controlling
weight
for
the
simple
reason
that
we
have
a
naked
word
to
define
that
there
is
not
much
context
and
issue.
it
is
a
word
--
mr.
william
french
smith
well,
i
--
i
want
to
answer
the
question
and
i'd
like
to
answer
it
this
way
if
i
--
mr.
william
french
smith
--
if
i
may,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
have
no
way
of
knowing
what
--
what
considerations
that
the
department
has
--
mr.
william
french
smith
no.
well
now,
that's
what
i'm
getting
to.
in
other
--
in
other
words,
the
only
thing
i
know
about
--
the
only
thing
that
--
the
guides
that
i
have
is
what
they
have
done
in
other
cases.
that's
the
only
thing
i
have.
and
i
say
that
in
the
other
cases,
they
have
taken
in
one
case
at
least,
their
contrary
position
and
in
the
very
case
that
they
rely
upon
here
is
being
controlling.
they
--
their
basic
position
--
mr.
william
french
smith
--
there
is
the
basic
position
which
i
am
taking
here.
now,
that
is
--
those
are
the
only
guides
i
can
go
by,
you
see.
mr.
william
french
smith
the
phillips
case.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
french
smith
well,
my
--
my
problem
of
course
is,
your
honor,
it
--
it's
perhaps
to
some
extent
that
certain
amount
of
arbitrariness
may
be
involved
in
defining
this
term
but
--
mr.
william
french
smith
--
we
don't
think
so.
we
just
--
we
think
that
--
that
we
are
entitled
to
some
extent
at
least
to
place
some
weight
upon
positions
that
the
petitioner
has
taken
another
situation
in
the
case.
mr.
william
french
smith
yes.
mr.
william
french
smith
well,
i
think
that's
too
and
i'd
also
like
to
point
out,
your
honor,
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
regulations
themselves
which
come
any
closer
to
determining
this
question
than
the
phillips
case
does.
so,
we're
perfectly
willing
to
stand
on
the
positions
that
the
department
has
taken.
mr.
william
french
smith
well,
your
honor,
i
have
--
mr.
william
french
smith
i
say
there's
a
practice
to
the
contrary.
mr.
william
french
smith
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
deal
with
that
in
the
brief
--
mr.
william
french
smith
--
but
i
don't
deal
with
the
question
that
the
mere
fact
that
they
have
taken
the
position
what
weight
that
is.
thank
you.
