justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
ms.
margolin,
may
i
ask.
would
we
have
the
same
case
if
all
five
of
these
buildings
were
in
the
same
block
or
the
same
group
at
the
same
location?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
they're
operated
precisely
as
they
are
now.
the
only
difference
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
that
they'd
all
be
in
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
geographic
consideration
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
then
in
your
argument
is
not
the
control?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
any
stated
reason
in
the
stipulation
why
the
units
are
located
as
they
are?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
are
there
many
of
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
--
mr.
smith,
did
you
say
that
originally
these
were
separate
establishments?
was
that
because
they've
been
in
independent
ownerships
or
other
ownerships
at
one
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
each
of
these
other
four
purposely
located
where
it
was,
the
gold
and
the
source
of
the
business
which
now
had
left
the
alameda
area?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
wouldn't
that
indicate
that
in
each
instance
as
it
was
established,
it
was
established
as
a
separate
establishment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
when
did
--
if
that's
the
fact,
when
did
it
lose
its
identity
for
the
purposes
of
the
statute
that
it
has
a
separate
establishment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
was
there
ever
a
time
when
each
--
although,
in
the
same
ownership
that
these
other
four
was
operated
as
an
independent
operation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
prior
to
that
time,
there
was?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
ms.
margolin,
is
there
anything
to
indicate
that
the
same
pattern
of
following
residential
development
explains
the
organization
of
these
other
divisions
in
los
angeles?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i
mean
is
--
is
there
--
as
the
location,
for
example,
of
where
the
12
divisions
of
los
angeles?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
see.
well,
is
there
anything
to
show
the
history
of
how
in
the
other
division,
if
that's
what
it
is,
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
warehouses
were
established
in
purchasing?
