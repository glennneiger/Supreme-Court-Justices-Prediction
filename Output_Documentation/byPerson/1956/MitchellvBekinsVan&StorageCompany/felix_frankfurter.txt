justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
are
all
of
these
divisions
interrelated
so
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wonder
that
if
in
their
activity
and
what
they
--
in
the
economic
function
that
they
serve,
are
these
19
interrelated
so
that
what
one
does
is
dependent
upon
what
another
does?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
you
compare
the
economic
results
of
these
19.
i'm
on
the
brink
of
saying,
units.
of
course,
a
single
owner
compares
the
output,
and
the
intake,
and
the
profit,
et
cetera,
in
the
course
of
individual
units.
but
as
i
understand
it
from
what
you
just
said,
there
is
no
physical,
functional,
or
economic
--
economical
interrelation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
among
those
19
except
that
you
compare
the
balance
sheet
of
each.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
anything
in
the
record
with
bearing
on
the
chief
justice's
question
indicating
that
the
customer
designates
in
what
warehouse?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
quantitative
testimony
--
any
testimony
giving
some
quantitative
light
on
this
subject?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down,
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
and
ms.
margolin,
is
that
enough
to
indicate
that
one
can
take
or
take
measure
as
to
then
whether
this
is
or
isn't
an
establishment
that's
clear,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
so
i
want
to
ask
you,
what
weight
is
one
to
attach
to
the
determination,
the
finding
by
the
wages
in
our
division
that
this
is
“an
establishment”
although
the
term
establishment
is
not
a
term
of
art,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
if
this
were
--
if
the
act
--
if
the
wages
now
as
that
and
the
kind
of
machinery
for
enforcement
that
it
was
originally
--
that
was
originally
proposed,
namely,
the
determination
is
akin
to
determinations
by
labor
board.
i
have
one
--
i
have
relatively
easy
found
it
myself.
now,
that
isn't
true
but
what
weight
am
i
to
attach
to
the
fact
that
these
people
who
deal
with
this
kind
of
business
day
--
day
after
day
and
all
the
complexity
and
complexities
of
the
problem
has
found
that
it
is
“an
establishment.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
can
read
that
as
well
they
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
an
abstract
definition
by
them.
i
don't
care
for
that
either
because
i
don't
think
that's
the
way
to
be
disposed
of
these
matters.
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
in
the
multiplicity
on
the
instances
that
company
for
that
governmental
agents
in
attributing
to
it
or
contentious
duty
to
apply
the
law
with
intelligence
not
with
presupposition
as
to
what
they
would
like
to
have
under
the
law.
what
weight
am
i
to
give
to
the
practicality
they
have
mentioned,
the
practicality
of
administration
by
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
sure
you
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
in
this
case.
has
there
been
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
in
the
phillips
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
as
i
say,
that
--
that
requires
us
to
read
the
statute
we've
taken
and
see
what
it
means
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
some
of
us
did
--
didn't
agree
with
what
was
said
in
that
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
differentiations
in
this
realm
abound
to
appear
to
just
examine
the
two
immediate
neighbors
arbitrarily.
but
if
there
has
been
a
consistent
administrative
practice
exercising
or
enforcing
the
judgment
of
those
who
deal
with
this
matter,
that's
very
wages.
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
the
wages
in
our
division
hasn't,
for
me,
and
wasn't
intended
to
have
the
function
that
the
labor
board
has
in
its
realm.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
dealt
with
this
phase
with
my
question
in
your
brief?
i
don't
mean
to
specifically
that
this
problem,
namely,
the
extent
to
which
practical
instances
in
the
application
of
the
statute
swing
in
the
view
of
wages
now
at
division
--
division.
this
case,
within
their
prior,
more
or
less
continuing
or
weight
in
practice,
have
you
dealt
with
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
whatever
it
is,
you
say
there
is
no
such
practice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
ms.
margolin,
not
questioning
at
all
the
interesting
history
that
you
point
out,
are
you
in
agreeing
with
mr.
smith
as
to
the,
relatively
as
i
gather
from
him,
--
is
you
--
the
relatively
minor
relation
from
the
point
of
view
of
customer
to
the
store
--
customer
to
warehouse,
the
customer's
explicit
utilization
or
designation
of
the
warehouse
near
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
do
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
didn't
understand
mr.
smith
to
deny
that
the
customer
could,
what
i
asked
him
and
what
i
asked
you
is
whether
in
fact
a
customer
goes
to
one
warehouse
rather
than
another,
the
way
my
wife
goes
to
the
safeway
one
rather
than
another.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
do
the
customers
--
because
the
record
show
that
the
customers
call
the
warehouse
nearest
to
their
residence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
large
in
the
determination
of
the
concern
itself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
an
abstract
way
of
seeing
the
problem,
that
all
depends
on
a
lot
of
other
circumstances.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
can't
start
out
by
saying
alameda
would
be
exempt
if
it
stood
along,
therefore,
it
must
be
exempt
if
it
doesn't
stand
alone
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
you
call
that
good
reasoning.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
would
have
to
be
functionally
segregable
too,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
be
kind
enough
to
answer
more
specifically
justice
burton's
question?
suppose
you
have
these
warehouses
all
in
one
huge
modern
village
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
will
you
sketch
the
segregable
nature
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
make
them
separate
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
this
very
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
this
record
except
they're
all
under
one
--
all
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
didn't
i
follow
you
entirely
that
the
mere
fact
that
it's
one
physical
structure
doesn't
make
it
one
establishment
in
the
sense
of
non-segregable
business?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
do
not
see
why,
by
the
same
process
of
reasoning,
the
fact
that
you
haven't
got
one
physical
location
makes
them
separate
establishments.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
doesn't
get
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
ms.
--
ms.
margolin,
this
business
of
the
small
grocery
store,
it
doesn't
get
me
very
far
because
congress
had
means
of
dealing
with
the
small
problem
in
a
very
effective
way.
it
didn't
do
that.
it
didn't
say
business
is
having
more
than
six
employees
or
eight
or
ten,
the
problem
that
you
and
i
well
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
could
have
dealt
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
--
but
when
i
have
a
word
by
the
establishment
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
i
have
a
word
by
the
establishment,
it
doesn't
equal
a
small
grocery
store.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
you
can
say
as
to
that.
that
wasn't
--
there
are
other
factors
in
that
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
ms.
margolin
can
i
ask
mr.
smith
one
question
in
order
--
if
possible
to
avoid
the
difficulties
i
have
of
deciding
this
kind
of
a
case?
and
i'm
now
asking
the
reverse
question
relevant
to
your
side
of
it,
namely,
that
every
predisposition
i
have
would
welcome
a
quantitative
text
such
as
on
the
whole
of
presumptively
you
suggest
as
equal
unit.
and
my
difficulty
is
that
congress
hasn't
quite
said
that
to
put
in
mind.
i
ask
mr.
smith
what
extent
i'm
to
be
bound
by
your
determination
by
the
determination
of
your
division.
how
much
can
i
rest
on
that?
as
i
said,
i'll
ask
you
the
reverse
question
about
the
complementary
question.
congress
said
--
saw
fit
not
to
do,
but
to
my
point
of
view,
it
would
be
desired,
the
determination
of
these
touchy,
suckle,
illusive
questions
by
a
board
that
would
be
the
determination
in
which
would
be
final
on
the
courts
unless
it
seems
outrageous
or
unwarranted
in
reason.
congress
hasn't
done
that.
congress
has
left
the
determination
to
courts.
and
in
this
case,
congress
has
seem
fit
to
make
these
issues
to
a
considerably
extent
to
put
in
mind
the
judicial
questions.
and
these
are
more
or
less
questions,
more
or
less
judgment.
and
we've
got
two
courts
holding
that
this
was
an
establishment.
now,
what
weight
am
i
to
attach
if
any
--
do
that
mode
of
determination
which
congress
has
seem
fit
to
choose
as
the
mode
of
determination?
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
i
heard
about
that
before?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
congress
has
adopted
your
reference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
you're
--
if
you're
right
about
that
which
i
will
welcome
then
i
don't
have
to
bother
about
anything
else.
you,
as
i
understand,
that
you
are
right
that
the
administratively
--
that
clear
determination
that
this
situation
is
quoted
within
the
establishment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
congress
said,
with
his
eyes
wide
open,
that
proponents
of
the
bill
said,
“we
are
aware
of
this
thing.
are
we
supposed
to
be
aware
of
it?
and
they
adopt
it.
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.”
and
i
don't
have
to
bother
about
phillips
or
anything
else.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you've
got
all
those
reference
in
your
brief,
ms.
margolin,
have
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
giving
it,
please?
justice
felix
frankfurter
125?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
79.
under
that.
thank
you
very
much.
