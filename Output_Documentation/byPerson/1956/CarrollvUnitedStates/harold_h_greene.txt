mr.
harold
h.
greene
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
context
of
this
case
there
are
two
prerequisites
to
the
appealability
of
the
decision.
in
the
first
place,
there
must
be
an
existence
of
statute
which
confers
appellate
jurisdiction
on
the
court
of
appeals.
secondly,
the
decision
from
which
the
appeal
is
sought
must
be
--
must
qualify
that
final
order.
and
so
far
as
the
statutory
jurisdiction
is
concerned,
we
rely
primarily
on
the
district
of
columbia
statute
to
which
i
will
come
in
a
moment.
we
also
rely
on
the
section
of
the
united
states
code
that
is
the
general
appeal
section
of
the
united
states
code.
but
both
of
those
statutes
require
as
a
prerequisite
to
the
operation
that
there
be
a
final
order,
the
final
decision
as
distinguished
from
interlocutory
decision.
and
so,
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
that
question
first
as
to
whether
we
have
a
final
order
in
a
decision
which
supresses
the
government's
evidence.
now,
basically,
there
are
two
criteria
which
are
found
in
the
decisions
for
determining,
and
for
measuring
whether
a
decision
measures
up
to
the
test
of
finality.
(voice

--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
that's
at
page
6
of
the
government's
brief.
that
title
23,
section
105,
district
of
columbia
code
provides,
in
all
the
criminal
prosecutions,
the
united
states
for
the
district
of
columbia
as
the
case
may
be,
can
have
the
same
right
of
appeal
that
is
given
to
the
defendant,
including
the
right
to
a
bill
of
exceptions,
provided
that
if
on
such
appeal
it
shall
be
found
that
there
was
error
in
the
rulings
of
the
court
during
a
trial,
a
verdict
in
favor
of
the
defendant
shall
not
be
set
aside.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
he
could
not
appeal.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
and
that's
--
that's
exactly
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well,
of
course,
we
can
have
a
right
of
appeal
at
that
point
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
that's
right,
yes.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
that
--
that
is
our
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
that's
our
argument.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
i
was
just
about
to
add
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
oh,
yes
that
we
concede
that
beyond
having
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
--
or
having
the
statute,
we
also
must
show
that
there's
--
there
is
a
final
decision
as
finality.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well
--
under
the
--
the
statute
itself
provides
for
a
--
for
jurisdiction
--
for
statutory
jurisdiction,
so
to
speak,
because
normally,
the
government
cannot
appeal
in
a
criminal
case
as
the
common
law.
but
this
statute
gives
us
jurisdiction
to
appeal
in
criminal
cases
in
the
district
of
columbia
provided
they
are
final.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
so,
we
don't
have
to
deal
in
this
case
with
the
federal
criminal
appeals
act
which
restricts
the
right
of
the
government
to
appeal
to
certain
decisions.
this
statute
is
broader
than
that
and
gives
us
the
right
to
appeal
in
any
criminal
case
in
the
district
of
columbia
which
is
final.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
that
is
correct.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
it's
final
for
that
reason
and
for
other
reasons
--it's
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well,
it's
final,
of
course,
as
to
the
--
as
to
the
proposition
that
it's
irreparable
as
to
the
government.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
and
it
is
separate.
it's
separate
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
it
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
that
is
--
that
is
correct.
that's
--
that's
our
basic
position.
we
can't
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
no.
we
can't
--
we
can't
renew
the
offer
--
we
can't
renew
the
offer
of
the
evidence
at
the
trial
and
the
defendant
can
new
the
motion
that
it
applied.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
that
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
that
means
it
must
be
final.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
that
means
--
that
simply
means
it
must
be
final.
in
other
words
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well,
the
acts
of
congress
i
suppose
would
apply
to
a
district
--
district
of
columbia
code.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
as
i
understand
it
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
seems
to
have
interpreted
those
two
statutes
combined.
it
means
that
under
the
section
105,
the
criminal
appeal
statute
is
modified
by
section
102
of
title
17
to
the
extent
that
we
must
have
a
final
order
before
--
before
we
can
appeal
in
a
criminal
case.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
we
get
a
final
order
because
--
unless
the
government
has
the
right
to
appeal
now,
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
--
they
will
never
have
a
right
to
appeal.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well,
we
have
a
very
specific
allowance
of
the
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well,
i
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
the
two
--
two
constructions
certainly
possible
of
the
--
of
the
district
of
columbia
appeals
act.
one
that
--
that
the
government
can
appeal
if
the
defendant
in
any
state
has
the
right
to
appeal
or
the
other,
that
the
government
can
appeal
if
the
defendant
has
the
right
to
appeal
at
that
very
same
stage.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
i
beg
you
pardon,
i
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
the
defendant
cannot
appeal
now
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
the
defendant
cannot
appeal
now.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
he
will
bring
up
--
he
will
bring
up
the
issue
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
yes.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well,
in
the
court
the
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
yes,
but
in
the
cogen
case,
of
course,
we
did
have
the
problem
of
--
of
a
--
of
an
order
denying
a
motion
to
suppress.
and
the
court
said
it
wasn't
final
there
because
the
defendant
had
the
right
to
renew
his
motion
at
trial.
it
was
interlocutory
as
to
him.
but
as
to
the
government,
the
rule
specifically
makes
that
precludes
the
government
from
renewing
the
motion
at
the
trial
because
it
either
provides
for
the
return
of
the
property
to
the
defendant
or
if
it's
contraband
then
it
provides
that
--
that
problem
shall
be
unavailable
at
any
trial
or
hearing.
for
the
cogen
case,
the
very
reasoning
of
the
cogen
case
cannot
apply
to
an
order
which
grants
the
motion
to
suppress.
but
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
yes,
your
honor.
i
might
say
that
in
the
cefaratti
case
in
which
judge
stevens
dissented,
the
petitioners
here
tried
to
obtain
a
hearing
en
banc
in
the
instant
case
to
overrule
cefaratti
and
that
hearing
en
banc
was
denied
unanimously
by
the
--
by
the
court
of
appeals.
so,
i
take
it
at
least
the
inference
might
be
drawn
at
the
present
time,
the
court
of
appeals
would
adhere
to
the
majority
of
the
cefaratti
decision.
now
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well
this
--
this
statute
that
--
that
the
district
of
columbia
code
followed
the
sanges
case.
and
congress,
i'd
take
it
made
clear
its
intention
there
to
depart
from
the
rule
of
the
sanges
case
by
giving
the
government
the
right
to
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well,
may
i
say
this
on
--
on
the
point
as
to
why
the
--
why
the
construction
shouldn't
be
adopted
that
the
government
can
only
appeal
if
the
defendant
has
the
right
to
appeal
at
the
same
stage.
i
suggest
that
then
the
statute
would
be
--
utterly
meaningless
because
the
only
stage
at
which
--
at
which
the
defendant
can
appeal
is
the
stage
of
the
judgment
of
conviction.
and
obviously
the
government
cannot
appeal
at
the
same
stage,
namely,
at
--
at
the
stage
of
the
government
--
of
the
judgment
of
acquittal.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
the
statute,
yes.
that's
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well,
that
can't
--
because
it's
impossible
because
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
because
the
government
could
obviously
not
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
acquittal.
and
this
exception
in
the
statute
that
provides
or
has
been
construed
to
preclude
the
government
from
--
through
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
acquittal.
so,
that's
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
that's
--
that's
our
position.
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
has
construed
the
statute
in
that
manner
and
this
court
has
said
a
number
of
times
that
in
respect
of
matters
of
local
law,
the
construction
given
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
should
not
be
upset
unless
it's
plainly
unreasonable.
and
i
suggest
that
isn't
plainly
unreasonable
here.
