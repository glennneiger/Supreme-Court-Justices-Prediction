mr.
curtis
p.
mitchell
honorable
chief
justice
and
associate
justices
of
the
court.
petitioner
has
come
before
this
court
and
complain
that
the
government
does
not
have
a
right
of
appeal
in
the
instance
where
the
district
court
has
granted
a
motion
to
suppress
evidence
after
indictment
and
pending
trial.
in
this
case,
if
it
please
the
court,
the
petitioners
has
filed
a
motion
to
suppress
evidence.
there
is
indication
in
the
respondent's
brief
that
there
was
also
a
motion
to
return
property.
i
might
say
to
the
court
that
the
two
other
defendants
that
is
below,
the
motions
having
been
denied
as
to
them,
the
government
for
some
reason
or
other
chose
to
dismiss.
there
was
no
appeal
taken
from
the
granting
of
one
of
the
motions
in
the
lower
court
not
respecting
these
petitioners
here
with
respect
to
the
return
of
property
ceased
from
some
premise.
so,
as
will
be
seen
from
a
reading
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
at
page
31
of
the
record,
that
this
case
comes
before
this
court
clearly
on
the
question
of
the
supression
of
evidence
ceased
from
the
person
of
the
two
petitioners
here.
the
government,
however,
claims
that
under
section
1291
of
title
28,
they
have
a
right
of
appeal.
our
contention
is
clear,
we
think,
that
there
is
no
statutory
right
granted
to
the
government
in
the
instance
of
the
interlocutory
order.
we
claim
that
the
order
in
this
instance
is
interlocutory
and
we
rely
up
on
our
proposition
for
the
opinion
rendered
by
this
honorable
court
in
the
case
of
cogen
versus
united
states,
the
cobbledick
case
and
of
the
recent
case
in
1955
of
bodinger
versus
united
states.
the
government
also
urges
in
their
brief
that
a
local
statute
which
is
title
23,
section
105
of
the
district
of
columbia
code
entitles
them
to
proceed.
i
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
on
behalf
of
the
petitioners
that
that
grants
them
no
relief
because,
first
of
all,
title
23,
section
105
was
passed
upon
by
this
court
in
the
case
of
united
states
versus
evans.
and
i
think
that's
to
be
found
at
213
u.s.reports.
in
addition,
there
is
the
section
17
--
title
17,
section
102
of
the
d.c.code
of
which
limits
in
the
same
fashion
as
section
1292
of
title
28
limits
the
right
to
appeal
from
interlocutory
orders.
moreover,
the
united
states
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
did
not
rely
upon
the
local
statute,
that
is
either
title
23
or
title
17
of
the
d.c.code
to
justify
their
decision.
they
squarely
state
that
the
decision
of
this
case
rests
upon
a
prior
decision
of
cefaratti
versus
united
states.
we
sought
a
certiorari
to
this
court,
but
because
of
the
matter
of
time,
the
petition
not
having
been
filed
in
time,
it
was
denied.
now,
in
that
case,
they
state
that
they
rely
squarely
upon
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
stack,
cohen
and
swift
cases.
i
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
the
stack
case,
the
cohen
case
and
the
swift
cases,
all
of
them
dealt
with
a
civil
matter
and
dealt
with
matters
that
were
entirely
independent
of
the
issue
in
trial.
for
instance,
the
stack
case
as
this
court
will
recall
dealt
with
the
matter
of
bond
pending
of
person's
appeal,
a
bail
bond.
in
the
other
case,
it
was
a
matter
of
the
attachment
dealing
with
the
--
an
admiralty
manner.
and
in
the
third,
it
was
a
matter
of
the
posting
of
security
of
cause
during
the
course
of
an
appeal
where
there
was
a
stock,
a
derivative
action
stockholder
suit.
mr.
curtis
p.
mitchell
yes.
mr.
curtis
p.
mitchell
that's
the
only
thing.
now,
the
government
as
we
see
it
and
we
urge
upon
this
court
is
in
a
rather
anomalous
position.
in
order
to
rely
upon
finality
as
was
set
forth
that
is
the
--
the
several
bases
on
which
finality
might
rest
as
determined
in
the
stack
or
of
the
swift
cases.
there
is
the
fourth
one
which
was
not
mentioned
in
the
cefaratti
case.
and
that
is
the
one
urging
that
the
matter
must
be
independent
of
the
issue
and
trial.
now,
the
government
attempts,
i
think
rather
feebly
to
straddle
that
issue
by
suggesting
that
this
is
independent
of
the
trial.
however,
on
the
other
hand,
they
urge
upon
this
court
as
they
did
in
the
court
below,
that
without
this
particular
evidence,
they
are
unable
to
go
forward
successfully.
we
state
that
the
failure
or
that
is
the
paucity
of
their
evidence
is
of
no
moment
and
we
believe
as
the
courts
have
held
in
the
decisions
i
indicated
to
the
court
like
the
cohen
case
for
instance,
the
bodinger
case
and
the
cobbledick
case.
now,
incidentally,
i
did
not
cite
--
i
did
not
cite
the
cobbledick
case
in
our
brief
but
the
cobbledick
case
is
to
be
found
at
309
u.s.beginning
at
page
323.
i
might
suggest
that
that
was
an
opinion,
i
believe
written
by
his
honor
judge
frank
--
justice
frankfurter.
so,
as
we
see
the
case
on
the
facts
as
they
are
at
issue
here,
and
as
mr.
justice
harlan
has
indicated,
now
the
sole
issue
then
is
one
of
finality.
we
say
that
there
is
no
finality
here
that
this
evidence
which
has
been
suppressed
by
the
court
is
necessary
by
the
government's
own
confession
and
intercourses
a
necessary
part
in
the
whole
trial
procedure.
mr.
curtis
p.
mitchell
no,
sir.
mr.
curtis
p.
mitchell
that's
the
necessary
conclusion,
your
honor.
mr.
curtis
p.
mitchell
now,
i
might
--
mr.
curtis
p.
mitchell
yes,
as
far
as
the
government
is
concerned,
yes.
we
take
the
--
mr.
curtis
p.
mitchell
that
--
mr.
curtis
p.
mitchell
mr.
justice
harlan
i
would
have
to
answer
you
the
same.
that
does
not
go
to
the
question
of
finality.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
that
lends
more
to
the
suggestion
that
it
is
an
integral
part
of
the
trial
proceeding
itself.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
is
therefore
entirely
consistent
with
the
pronouncement
of
this
court
in
the
bodinger
case
against
the
honorable
decisions
for
instance
on
the
one
hand
and
the
allowance
of
piecemeal
mere
litigation
on
the
other.
and
there
would
fundamentally
be
the
constitutional
issue
involved.
for
instance
as
of
this
case,
as
you
will
notice
from
the
record,
we
have
been
over
three
years.
so,
therefore,
the
trial,
the
right
of
the
speedy
trial,
the
constitutional
right
to
a
speedy
trial
is
necessarily
involved
in
this
issue
because
at
any
moment,
in
further
answer
to
your
question,
that
the
government
felt
and
this
is
a
conclusion
left
up
entirely
to
the
government
that
they
felt
that
they
would
be
incapable
of
proceeding
further
successfully,
than
they
would
on
--
on
the
occasion
of
an
adverse
ruling
than
they
would
want
to
appeal.
certainly,
this
court
can
appreciate
the
confusion
that
would
reign
in
our
appellate
courts
under
such
circumstances.
and
also
the
confusion
inhabited
would
prevail
in
the
instance
of
the
matter
of
trial,
of
litigation.
it
would,
as
it
has
been
done
here,
this
trial
--
the
trial
of
these
people
has
been
held
up
for
approximately
three
years.
i
don't
think
that
is
consistent
with
the
pronouncements
of
this
court.
we
say
that
the
government
in
this
instance
does
not
come
within
the
purview
of
the
--
the
statute,
of
the
statute
which
regulates
the
matter
of
appeal
on
behalf
of
the
government
and
coming
further
to
your
question
that
it
must
come
within
the
area
of
finality,
that
this
being
an
integral
part
of
the
trial
proceeding
itself
does
not
come
properly
as
a
final
order
or
decree.
it's
interlocutory
therefore
in
the
character
and
that
the
government
may
not
appeal
from
it.
mr.
curtis
p.
mitchell
may
i?
mr.
curtis
p.
mitchell
first,
if
it
please
the
court.
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
whittaker's
question,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
similar
--
somewhat
similar
to
your
own
state
(inaudible)
it
was
originally
the
intention
of
congress
to
give
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
united
states
government
in
the
district
of
columbia
the
right
of
appeal
in
order
that
they
would
get
what
was
in
the
nature
of
advisory
opinions.
so
the
word
same
in
there
means
that.
however,
that
issue
came
before
this
court.
in
the
case
of
evans,
the
united
states
versus
evans
in
which
this
court
held
that
they
did
not
have
the
--
congress
could
not
grant
them
that
authority.
now,
while
that
--
mr.
curtis
p.
mitchell
yes,
sir.
mr.
curtis
p.
mitchell
yes,
sir.
why
it
was
not
taken
off
the
books,
i'm
unable
to
tell
the
court.
now,
the
criminal
--
the
criminal
appeals
act
was
passed
on
1948,
subsequent
of
course
to
the
enactment
of
title
23,
section
105.
and
so
obviously
--
obviously,
i
would
say
that
congress
must
have
had
in
contemplation
of
the
preceding
legislation
and
whatever
rights
and
limitations
they
want
to
place
upon
the
government
in
that
respect.
now,
the
other
thing
that
i
wish
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
and
which
is
contained
in
the
brief
in
a
brief
fashion
and
that
is,
that
the
government
is
now
before
this
court.
in
effect,
asking
this
court
to
extend
or
to
broaden
the
right
of
the
government's
appeal.
and
at
the
same
time,
the
very
same
gentleman
who
is
urging
this
before
the
court
was
before
congress,
asking
congress
specifically
to
give
him
the
authority
to
do
what
they
say
they
now
have
the
right
to
do
under
this
so-called
rule
now.
mr.
curtis
p.
mitchell
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
curtis
p.
mitchell
i
don't
--
i
--
i
say
this.
that
the
establishment
of
the
federal
courts
of
the
united
states
presuppose
the
--
the
integrity
of
the
members
of
the
bank
and
i
think
that
the
district
courts
are
certainly
capable
of
protecting
the
rights
and
interests
of
the
united
states
in
this
regard.
i
must
also
go
back
and
look
as
your
honor,
justice
frankfurter,
has
to
the
historical
background.
originally
in
common
law,
there
was
no
right
of
appeal
at
all.
so
now,
that
the
government
is
saying
that
they
find
themselves
spoiled
by
the
paucity
of
their
own
evidence.
now,
in
the
record,
beginning
at
page
27,
you'll
find
there,
i
think,
seven
type-written
pages
of
what
the
government
contended
below
constituted
evidence.
so,
here
they
find
themselves
barred
not
because
they
don't
have
any
evidence
at
all
but
because
they
say
the
--
the
failure
or
the
refusal
on
the
part
of
the
court
because
of
the
constitutional
prohibition
to
allow
them
to
engage
the
use
of
the
things
that
they
seized
from
the
person
enables
them
to
--
to
proceed
further
successfully.
now,
as
the
court
said
in
the
rosenwasser
case
and
in
more
recently
in
the
janitz
case,
that
doesn't
make
a
bit
of
difference.
and
i
think
that
that
same
sort
of
thing
is
really
re-announced
in
this
court's
opinion
in
the
bodinger
case.
mr.
curtis
p.
mitchell
i
think
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
curtis
p.
mitchell
no,
sir.
mr.
curtis
p.
mitchell
yes.
mr.
curtis
p.
mitchell
that's
right.
there
--
there
--
mr.
curtis
p.
mitchell
--
be
if
this
--
if
their
relief
--
mr.
curtis
p.
mitchell
my
answer
--
mr.
curtis
p.
mitchell
my
--
my
--
mr.
curtis
p.
mitchell
my
answer
to
your
honor
is
that
it
--
it
does
not
confer
any
right
upon
the
government
and
does
not
give
them
any
way
to
proceed.
mr.
curtis
p.
mitchell
yes.
and
i
think
this
court
so
found
in
the
evans
case.
