whittaker
do
you
agree
then,
as
i
understand
it
(inaudible)
do
you
agree
that
this
question
is
reasonable
--
it's
reasonable
now
or
never?
it's
reviewable
now
or
never?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
couldn't
that
be
changed
by
statute
and
does
the
statute
do
so?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
is
it
within
the
power
of
congress
to
permit
the
government
to
appeal
an
adverse
judgment
in
the
criminal
case
--
in
the
criminal
case.
and
if
so,
does
this
statute
do
it?
i
noticed
it
says
that
the
united
states
shall
have
the
same
right
of
appeal.
now,
then
if
they
are
the
same
rights
to
appeal,
they
must
be
identical
rights
of
appeal.
will
they
be?
and
each
would
then
come
after
a
judgment
of
finality
because
is
there
anything
to
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
among
the
doctrine
that
is
nearest
maybe,
you
have
to
allow
the
government
to
appeal
now
in
--
in
order
to
make
the
appeal
equal
with
that
of
the
defendant
if
there
is
to
be
one.
is
that
your
argument?
