mr.
john
s.
wrinkle
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
hereby
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
sixth
circuit.
i
think
it's
--
well,
within
the
views
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
--
on
monday
and
concurred
in
by
mr.
justice
harlan.
it
originated
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
tennessee,
southern
division.
it's
a
suit
on
a
policy
of
national
service
life
insurance.
charles
oscar
peak
jr.,
then
18
years
of
age
was
inducted
in
the
military
service
on
april
the
29th,
1943.
and
he
applied
for
and
received
deposit
insurance
effective
may
the
1st,
1943,
and
he
continued
to
serve
until
july
the
5th,
1943
when
he
disappeared
and
no
tidings
or
intelligence
had
been
heard
of
him,
since.
and
the
suit
was
filed
on
the
19th
day
of
february
in
1954.
he's
insisted
in
the
complaint
that
presumption
of
death
took
effect
on
the
5th
of
july,
1950.
sometime
thereafter,
mrs.
peak,
leona
peak,
the
mother
and
the
beneficiary
of
the
policy
applied
to
the
veterans
administration
for
the
benefits
of
the
policy
and
that
was
denied.
and
she
then
filed
a
suit
in
the
complaint
that's
charged
that
he
was
suffering
from
chorea,
nervousness,
general
disability,
and
weakness,
despondency
and
st.
vitus
dance
and
that
he
was
home
loving,
devoted
to
his
parents
to
his
only
sister
that
he
communicated
with
them
regularly
and
that
they
had
a
letter
dated,
the
30th
of
july
1943,
and
no
intelligent
or
tidings
from
him
since
and
that
in
his
disabled
condition,
it's
alleged
that
he
was
totally
and
permanently
disabled.
that
allegation
in
the
complaint
is
not
for
seeking
to
keep
the
insurance
and
the
fact
by
virtues
having
waiver
of
the
premiums
on
the
policy
because
no
act
to
such
application
was
made
nor
did
mrs.
peak
here
will
make
any
such
application,
unless
it
could
be
considered
in
applying
to
the
veterans
administration
for
the
benefits
of
the
policy
that
she
did
that.
it's
also
alleged
in
the
declaration
that
on
a
private
insurance
policy
in
american
national
life
insurance
company
in
which
the
file
there
was
the
beneficiary
that
the
suit
was
filed
in
the
chancery
court
of
hamilton
county,
tennessee,
to
declare
that
he
was
dead
and
that
he
died
on
or
about
the
day
to
his
disappearance,
july
the
30th,
1943.
that
case
was
heard.
i
didn't
tried
that
case
and
didn't
come
into
this
one
until
some
time
later,
but
it
was
decreed
by
the
chancellor
that
the
conditions
that
are
set
out
in
the
complaint
that
he
couldn't
have
lived
for
any
length
of
time
and
that
he
did
die
on
or
about
july
the
30th,
1943,
and
that
policy
was
paid.
now,
the
government's
plea
to
the
complaint
filed
by
mrs.
peak
was
to
dismiss
first
because
of
lack
of
jurisdiction
in
the
united
states
district
court.
and
second,
because
there
was
no
cause
of
action
or
grounds
for
payment
stated
in
--
in
the
complaint.
and
the
district
judge
construed
section
810
of
the
title
38
of
the
code
that
was
for
the
purpose,
we
think,
to
make
uniform
throughout
the
united
states,
the
law
with
respect
to
--
in
national
service
life
insurance
policies
that
the
death
couldn't
take
effect
under
that
statute
or
be
construed
to
except
at
the
end
of
the
seven-year
period.
it
is
our
insistence
that
--
that
statute
didn't
undertake
to
repeal
and
didn't
repeal
the
english
common
law.
and
that
the
presumption
wise
at
--
july
the
30th,
1950,
that
the
soldier
was
dead
but
left
open
in
subject
to
prove
as
to
whether
he
died
on
july
the
30th
and
the
circumstances
of
his
disappearance,
and
his
physical
and
mental
condition,
and
his
experience
in
life
in
whether
he
could
have
lived
for
any
lengths
of
time.
we
insist
that
he
died
on
july
the
5th
that
his
nature
was
such
that
he
certainly
would've
communicated
with
his
family
right
away.
if
anything
had
happened
to
him,
he
could
have
communicated.
however,
i
asked,
we,
as
now
alleged
in
the
complaint
to
accept
that
he
disappeared
on
the
30th
of
july.
my
understanding
is
that
soldiers
at
that
time
recruits
were
paid
$75,000
a
month.
he
would
have
earned
nearly
$75,000,
say
$72,000,
and
therefore,
the
policy
usually
cost
about
$6
that
would
have
kept
in
it
in
effect
for
12
months.
we
don't
think
he
did
die
at
the
end
of
12
months,
but
we
think
he
died
immediately
in
the
facts
that
are
stated
here.
now,
the
district
judge
didn't
pass
it
all
upon
that
question
of
the
statute
of
limitations
of
six
years.
here,
it
was
charged
in
the
petition
that
the
statute
of
limitations
was
told
during
the
seven
years
for
waiting
to
see
whether
he
was
dead
and
whether
the
presumption
would
ever
take
effect.
and
it
went
from
the
district
court
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
the
circuit
court
appeals
doesn't
seem
to
withheld
with
judge
darrah
and
correct
in
--
his
interpretation
of
section
810
of
the
title
38.
they
say
that
the
complaint
doesn't
state
cause
of
action,
circumstances
sufficient
to
justify
a
court
or
jury
in
finding
and
holding
that
he
did
die
about
july
the
30th.
they
say
that
it
has
to
take
some
impending
--
be
exposed
to
some
impending
danger
or
some
impending
disaster
searches
in
davie
versus
briggs
that's
decided,
i
believe,
in
85
u.s.
by
this
court.
and
we
cite
cases
from
the
fifth
circuit
and
from
the
fourth
circuit
that
are
contrary
to
the
holding
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
and
in
fact
in
the
case
of
--
one
case
that
we've
cite
that's
the
--
that's
the
case
of
united
states
versus
hayman,
judge
hutcheson
writing
the
opinion
of
the
court
that
he
didn't
have
to
be
exposed
to
the
some
calamity.
this
man
had
jacksonian
epilepsy
and
he
was
in
the
muscle
shoals
area
with
a
stranger
and
a
strange
land
as
was
this
soldier
that
make
in
georgia
and
he
was
never
heard
of
for
any
tidings
or
intelligence.
and
if
i
may,
i'll
read
what
judge
hutcheson
said
with
respect
to
davie
versus
briggs.
the
supreme
court
of
united
states
has
itself
declined
to
accept,
as
exclusive,
the
rule
of
davie
versus
briggs
that
a
proof
must
be
made
at
the
time
of
the
disappearance
of
the
person
or
subject
to
peril
or
danger
citing
at
the
fidelity
mutual
life
insurance
company
versus
mettler
185
--
185
u.s
308.
and
then,
in
that
case,
it
was
declared
that
the
inference
of
death
might
arise
from
the
disappearance
inconsistent
with
the
continuance
of
life
even
though
exposed
to
the
some
particular
peril
is
not
shown.
now,
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs
and
is
published,
and
published
in
the
record
also,
they
cited
the
mutual
life
--
the
fidelity
mutual
life
insurance
versus
mettler.
and
in
--
in
that
case,
it
wasn't
held.
that
was
the
case
as
down
in
texas
where
a
man
with
a
team
going
to
--
and
they're
on
some
land
and
he
was
near
a
little
river
and
he
disappeared
and
they
finally
found
the
place
where
he
had
camped
and
one
of
the
horses
was
gone
and
another
one
was
almost
starved
and
tracks
were
leading
toward
the
river.
and
they
didn't
find
any
tracks
of
the
man
lead
in
ways
in
the
river.
that
suit
was
brought
before
seven
years
had
expired.
and
in
--
in
that
case,
this
court
had
proved
it
and
cited
the
case
of
davie
versus
briggs.
now,
in
davie
versus
briggs,
it
was
on
north
carolina
land
case
and
the
complainants
contended
that
the
man
that
had
disappeared,
allen
jones
davie,
had
--
had
died
at
the
end
of
the
seven-year
period.
it
changed
the
statute
of
limitations
on
the
suit
there,
but
this
court
held
that
he
had
died
in
1851.
now,
he
was
on
a
tour
from
north
carolina
through
the
indian
territory
seeking
the
road
of
california.
and
after
he
had
reached
the
indian
territory,
he
was
never
heard
of
again.
and
mr.
--
first,
mr.
justice
harlan,
wrote
the
opinion
of
the
court
and
according
on
the
court
of
the
king's
bench
said
where
a
party
has
been
absent
seven
years,
without
having
been
heard
of,
the
only
presumption
arising
is
that
if
he
is
then
dead.
there,
it
is
none
as
to
the
time
of
his
death.
and
then
the
court
went
on,
we
therefore,
follow
the
established
law
when
we
inquire
whether
according
to
the
evidence,
allen
jones
davie
died
at
an
earlier
date
than
at
the
end
of
expiration
in
seven
years
when
the
legal
presumption
of
death
rules.
it
seems
to
us
that
upon
the
showing
made
by
the
complainants
themselves
that
conclusion
is
inevitable
that
he
died
some
time
during
year
1951.
the
most
recent
case
is
that
of
willhite,
the
united
states
versus
willhite
of
the
fourth
circuit.
it
originated
in
the
state
of
north
carolina.
george
skinner
was
a
soldier
and
was
stationed
at
camp
patrick
henry,
virginia.
and
he
went
home
to
visit
his
folks
and
his
unit
was
supposed
of
what
we
will
see
shortly
as
what
is
the
unit
of
the
young
man
in
this
case.
and
he
was
in
good
health,
perfect
except
(inaudible)
so
far
as
the
record
is
concerned.
and
he
had
told
his
father
and
mother
but
not
his
wife
that
he
would
die
before
he
would
go
overseas
and
had
requested
his
father
to
care
for
the
dog
or
his
dog
that
he
didn't
expect
either
to
ever
see
either
his
dog
or
his
parents
again.
he
didn't
report
in
for
the
fort
of
camp
patrick
henry,
virginia,
and
was
missing
a
day
after.
after
seven
years,
this
suit
was
brought
and
the
district
court
and
the
jury
held
that
there
was
this
vision
showing
that
he
was
dead
and
--
and
that
he
died
about
the
date
of
his
disappearance
as
we're
insisting
in
--
in
this
case.
that
sir
went
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
of
the
fourth
circuit
and
reveal
an
average
opinion
that
the
court
held
that
jury
and
the
lower
court
were
correct
and
the
action
on
the
matter
and
within
the
proof.
another
case
is
united
states
versus
hayman
that
i
mentioned
a
while
ago,
this
court
quotes
from
the
hayman
case
at
great
length.
and
--
as
there's
another
case
says
a
case
of
the
united
states
--
howard
versus
the
united
states
that
originated
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
washington
state
and
that
was
held
that
the
statute
of
limitation
didn't
began
to
run
until
the
seven-year
period
had
elapsed
as
in
hayman
--
united
states
versus
hamman
and
the
united
states
versus
willhite
that
all
three
did
the
same
holding.
now,
we
--
we
didn't
cite
the
case
in
our
brief
but
it's
cited
at
--
in
the
willhite
case
by
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
with
the
fourth
circuit
of
howard
versus
equitable
life
insurance
society
85
pacific
2d
253.
now,
the
soldier
in
the
howard
case
was
charles
a.
navone
and
the
widow
had
remarried.
there's
a
reason
that
it's
filed,
the
howard
versus
the
united
states.
now
then,
that
case
is
accorded
at
the
length
and
the
willhite
case.
and
another
case
is
--
mr.
john
s.
wrinkle
howard
versus
equitable
life
insurance
society
85
pacific
2d
253.
now,
that
--
that
case
is
cited
in
the
willhite
case
and
--
and
all
the
cases
cite
--
the
hayan
case
from
alabama
at
--
at
muscles
shouls
and
we
--
we
think
unquestionably
that
another
case
as
directly
in
point
is
from
the
fifth
circuit
and
that's
the
mutual
life
insurance
company
versus
hamilton.
hamilton
was
a
married
man
and
with
several
children,
grown
children,
and
he
had
been
in
the
penitentiary
of
georgia
for
bad
offense
and
had
a
great
deal
to
more
insurance
and
his
means
and
his
standing
problem,
the
community
would
have
justified.
but
his
mother
had
always
stood
by
him
and
she
had
mortgage
their
home
to
give
him
some
money
to
go
in
business
in
1929.
and
he
disappeared
on
the
night
of
the
28th,
1929,
indicating
to
his
daughter
that
he
was
turning
the
business
over
to
her
and
her
husband
and
he
was
going
elsewhere
but
no
question
with
what
he
was
in
bad
health
but
his
premiums
went
due
again
for
about
a
year.
and
at
the
end
of
seven
years,
that
suit
was
brought
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
florida
against
the
life
insurance
company
and
that
went
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
judge
hutcheson
participated
in
that
case,
cited
in
it
that
one
of
the
other
judges
wrote
the
opinion
of
the
court.
and
they
say
here
the
same
thing
as
these
other
court's
rule.
now,
the
--
the
defendant
insist
that
the
statute
begins
to
run
at
the
time
of
his
disappearance
and
cited
number
of
cases
of
this
court
which
in
workman's
compensation
cases
that
the
decision
here
to
justify
their
contention
in
this
case.
we
don't
think
it
applies.
but
the
statute
reads
in
--
in
full
that
no
suit
or
yearly
renewable
term
insurance
shall
be
allowed
under
this
section
unless
essential
had
been
brought
within
six
years
after
the
right
approved
on
which
the
claim
is
made
or
within
one
year
after
the
date
of
approval
of
the
--
this
amendatory
act,
july
3rd,
1930,
whichever
is
a
later
date
and
no
suit
on
the
united
states
government
life
converted
the
insurance
shall
be
allowed
under
this
section
unless
essential
had
been
brought
within
six
years.
and
then
the
right
accrued
for
the
claim
and
--
and
the
right
accrued
for
which
the
claim
is
made.
now,
we
insist
that
--
that
that
statute
includes
to
what
was
the
law
at
the
time
it
was
passed
that
their
common
law
and
their
law
in
america
is
that
the
statute
doesn't
begin
to
run
until
seven
years
and
that
the
right
didn't
approve
until
seven
years
because
there
was
no
opportunity
at
all
to
prove
this
death
and
there
were
presumption
which
take
effect
on
july
the
5th,
1950.
now,
the
suit
was
well
brought
within
six
years
after
that
period.
and
we
--
we
think
that
the
sovereign
--
we're
not
asking
the
sovereign
to
waive
its
immunity
to
suit.
the
--
its
immunity
to
suit
didn't
begin
to
run
until
1950
and
wouldn't
have
expired
of
course
until
1956.
and
that
therefore,
we
are
within
that
time
provided
for
and
the
--
the
statute
of
the
district
judge
construed
to
be
binding
on
him
as
this,
810,
“no
straight
law
providing
for
presumption
of
that
shall
be
applicable
to
plan
for
national
life
insurance.”
well,
that's
a
claim,
i
think
that
means
the
statutory
law
of
the
state
that
we
don't
contend
that
any
tennessee
law
applies
though
we
do
cited
a
very
famous
tennessee
case
where
the
chief
justice
held
in
his
opinion
that
the
statute
didn't
begin
to
run
until
seven
years.
now
then,
the
part
that
i
think
confused
the
district
judge
is
this.
if
evidence
says
factual
to
the
administrator,
he's
used
to
establishing
the
facts
continued
an
unexplained
absence
of
any
individual
from
his
home
and
family
for
a
period
of
seven
years
during
which
the
--
during
which
period
no
evidence
of
his
existence
has
--
has
been
received.
the
death
of
such
individual
as
the
date
of
the
expiration
of
such
period
may,
for
the
purpose
of
this
chapter,
be
considered
as
sufficiently
proved.
now,
we
think
that
if
it
was
sought
to
prove
his
death
at
the
end
of
the
seven
years
that
that
would
be
all
right.
the
district
judge
whereas
the
inquiring
by
in
his
opinion,
they'd
make
such
a
statute.
he
sought
that
perhaps
it
might
be
a
waiver
of
premium
as
in
that
the
soldier
would
have
him
waived
and
still
be
in
trying
to
recover
if
it
took
effect
at
the
end
of
the
seven-year
period.
but
we
think
that's
just
permissive.
it
hasn't
changed
the
common
law
that
it
hasn't
--
that
the
administrator
himself
could
receive
the
evidence
of
any
evidence
were
to
appear
showing
that
it
died
early
and
that
he
himself
could
administer
it
there
and
find
that
this
deceased
died
on
the
5th
of
july,
1950,
that
it's
a
permissive
statute,
that
part
of
evident.
that's
our
contention.
if
i
may,
i'll
just
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
john
s.
wrinkle
in
fact
if
i
need
to
--
mr.
john
s.
wrinkle
i
don't
know.
mr.
john
s.
wrinkle
if
i
may
go
out
at
the
record
a
little,
mr.
c.
g.
milligan
who
is
on
our
brief
has
account
some
representative
in
the
american
national
to
life
insurance
company
and
that
company
had
felt
the
policy
ought
to
being
paid
and
he
brought
a
suit
against
the
father
to
have
that
settled.
and
in
that
connection,
he
discovered
about
this
insurance
and
thought
it
ought
to
be
paid
and
he
hadn't
had
experience
in
this
sort
of
case
and
he
called
on
me.
now,
it's
really
a
tragedy
and
this
case,
the
boy
had
had
childhood
disease
or
something
that
disable
him
and
he
was
an
only
son
and
the
father
was
very
proud
of
him
and
the
mother
wanted
to
claim
exemption
from
the
draft
and
the
father
wouldn't
agree
to
that
and
they
get
him
and
in
the
army
and
he
--
one
of
these
boys
who
don't
(inaudible)
studied
with
--
what
seemed
to
me
from
what
i
understand.
now,
with
respect
to
the
statute
of
limitations,
mr.
leonard
would
attribute
to
the
congress
something
that
i
don't
think
is
fair
to
congress
in
passing
such
a
law.
it's
been
the
law
since
the
time
in
memorial
that
a
presumption
of
death
would
carry
it
at
the
end
of
seven
years.
and
congress
knew
that
when
they
passed
this
statute
that's
been
read
when
it
was
through.
now
then,
in
no
case
if
mr.
leonard's
interpretation
were
correct,
would
anyone
recover
because
the
statute
of
limitations
would
run
of
six
years
before
seven
years
for
the
presumption
of
death.
and
it's
to
be
assumed
that
congress
well
knew
that
rule
and
when
they
passed
this
statute
reading,
no
sue
to
her
and
yes,
their
renewable
term
insurance
shall
be
allowed
under
the
section
unless
the
same
shall
have
been
brought
within
the
six
years
after
the
right
accrued
for
which
the
claim
is
made
or
within
one
year
after
the
day
of
the
approval
of
the
mandatory
act.
that
was
in
--
in
about
1930,
we're
relating
at
that
time
to
war
risk
insurance
from
world
war
i.
now
then,
provided
that
for
the
purpose
of
this
section,
it
shall
be
deemed
that
the
right
accrued
on
the
happening
of
the
contingency
on
which
the
claim
was
founded.
now,
that
was
there
and
there
was
no
way
to
show
that
he
was
dead
until
the
end
of
the
seven
years.
consequently,
congress
knew
the
rule
with
respect
to
life
insurance
company
as
generally
and
administration
of
the
life
insurance
policies
and
we
have
get
to
read
into
what
the
common
law
was
at
that
time
on
what
they
meant
about
that.
to
me,
its
very
clear
that
that
was
what
congress
intended
just
like
the
willhite
case
and
the
howard
case
in
the
state
court
of
washington
as
i
believe
with
the
federal
court
in
the
howard
case
with
two
separate
ones.
the
tennessee
court's
agree
that
georgia
--
the
florida
courts,
hamilton
mutual
life
against
hamilton
was
a
florida
case.
this
north
carolina
case
was
a
federal
case,
of
course,
under
this.
and
with
respect
to
the
presumption
of
death
in
the
hayman
case
is
the
same
thing.
there
was
no
statute
of
limitations
claimed
there
because
it
was
before
the
statute
had
run.
mr.
john
s.
wrinkle
that's
right.
and
that's
the
holding
of
the
courts
in
the
howard
and
the
willhite
case.
mr.
john
s.
wrinkle
i
don't
think
it
was
made.
i
didn't
intend
to
infer
--
mr.
john
s.
wrinkle
--
from
the
pleading.
mr.
john
s.
wrinkle
well,
no
state
statute
now
in
the
willhite
case,
the
court
that
goes
on
to
say
that
some
states
have
statute
maybe
have
different
from
the
seven
years.
our
statute
is
seven
years.
i
think
many
of
the
states
had
seven
years.
some
say
--
the
willhite
case
says
some
states
have
no
statute
at
all
that
they
just
rely
upon
the
common
law.
and
i
think
that's
true
here
that
that
was
true
in
england
and
true
in
the
early
days
of
amount
and
before
we
had
our
present
federal
courts.
