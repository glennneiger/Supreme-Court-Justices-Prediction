on
the
second
point,
there's
no

what
you're
saying
is
that's
the
claim.

but
the
suggestion

the

that
you

you
have

you
have
no
business
to
assume
that
the
policy
wasn't
kept
alive
as,
i
understood
the
suggestion
and
the
question
put
to
you.
justice
felix

but
i
don't
think

i
don't

i'd
like
to
ask
you.

i
--
i'd

no
matter
how
favorably
you
construe
the
pleading.
are
you
supposed

which
on

face
of
a
complaint
told
the
statute

it
operated
in

of
the
plaintiff?
is
that
of
another
presumption
that
another
favor
that's
to
be
assumed
to
the

if
on

it,
the

is
it
to

the
exceptions

lift

bar
also
operate
in

it's

that
comes
within
my
knowledge

i
should
be

justice

well,
but
that
would
be
barring
that
that
would
be
a
condition
that
lifted
to
the
bar.
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
question
is
whether
any
such
presumption
of
favorable
construction
is
to
be
taken
when
on
the
face
of
the
complaint
on
a
given
theory,
statute
of
limitation
bar
recovers.
it
would
be
very
surprising
to
be
indeed.
