justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
state
what
i
understand
your
position
to
be
and
see
if
i
--
that
went
straight
in
my
mind.
you
say
that
she
had
an
election
neither
to
proceed
on
the
common
law
presumption
of
death
or
on
the
statutory
presumption,
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
you're
assuming
that
she
could
for
your
purpose
of
your
argument.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
your
position
was
that
if
she
was
proceeding
on
the
common
law
assumption
which
you
say
she
has
to
do
because
she
has
to
show
the
policy
was
in
effect
at
the
time
of
death,
that
on
that
basis,
she'd
be
out
because
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
justice
john
m.
harlan
then
i
thought
you
said
that
if
she's
relying
on
the
statutory
presumption,
namely,
the
death
occurred
at
the
end
of
seven
years
and
then
the
cause
of
action
proves
then,
she
is
on
her
pleading
shown
that
the
policy
was
not
in
full
force
in
effect
of
that
time
and
nothing
as
alleged
that
would
excuse
payment
of
the
premium,
so
the
policy
will
be
kept
alive
during
that
additional
period.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
then,
i
wish
you
would.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
she
isn't
able
to
prove
death.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
come
back
again
to
my
confusion
or
to
this
confusion?
you
say,
number
one,
that
take
in
terms
of
the
face
value
of
which
this
man
died
in
1943
and
the
action
on
having
them
brought
to
1954
statute
bars
it,
is
that
true?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
say
secondly
is
that
if
you
choose
to
regard
the
cause
of
action
as
accruing
under
the
act
at
the
end
of
the
seven
year
period,
namely,
that
he
died
in
1950
then
there's
nothing
to
show
that
the
policy
was
in
full
portion
effect
or
any
allegation
that
the
payment
of
premium
was
excused
during
the
interval.
is
that
your
position?
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
which
--
it
seems
to
me
that
whichever
where
you
regard
the
situation
or
why
do
you
have
to
reach
the
statute
of
limitations
because
if
you
take
it
on
her
premise,
it
is
1943
in
the
statute's
run.
if
you
take
it
on
the
--
on
the
presumption
that
--
the
statutory
presumption
that
the
action
didn't
include
1950,
there's
no
cause
of
action
for
another
reason
and
with
--
the
policy
is
not
full
force
in
effect,
so
you
don't
reach
the
question
to
use
to
what
statute
of
limitation.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
what
i
want
to
get
clear.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
do
you
do
with
section
610,
which
says,
"no
state
law
providing
the
presumption
of
death
shall
be
applicable
to
claims
for
national
life
insurance,
the
national
life
insurance.‚Äù
what
do
you
with
that?
