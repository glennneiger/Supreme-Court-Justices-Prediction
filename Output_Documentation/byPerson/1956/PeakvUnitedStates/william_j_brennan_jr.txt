justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
what's
--
you
say
it
ran
out.
what
form
it
did
take
running
out?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
noticed
at
page
3,
this
is
the
complaint
as
an
allegation
to
the
last
paragraph
of
due
application
was
made.
it
didn't
say
when
but
down
toward
the
end
of
the
paragraph,
it
says
that
--
a
verse
with
at
the
time
during
which
are
application
for
said
insurance
was
pending
before
the
veterans
administration,
the
seven-year
period
of
her
son's
unexplained
absence
told
the
statute.
now,
do
i
correctly
infer
from
that
this
application
of
hers
or
whatever
it
was,
this
due
application
was
pending
during
the
seven
year-period?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
don't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
--
you
said
this
controlled
by
the
complaint.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
don't
know
why
it
is
improper
to
infer
them
that
--
from
this
language
that
our
application
for
the
insurance
was
made
in
the
seven-year
period
because
it
says
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
it
says,
while
application
for
insurance
was
pending,
the
seven-year
period
of
her
son's
unexplained
absence
told
the
statute
of
limitation
and
that
the
six-year
status
of
limitations
has
not
yet
expired.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
if
i'm
right,
whether
you
agree
who
i
am
or
not,
in
inferring
from
that
language
that
it
was
filed
during
the
seven-year
period
whereas
that
indicate
that
it
wasn't
filed
before
this
policy
lapsed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
why
--
you
said
that
policy
lapsed
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
how
do
we
know
that
the
--
from
this
allegation
in
any
event
that
the
claim
wasn't
made
before
the
lapse?
and
i
gather
if
it
was
made
before
the
lapsed,
then
you
don't
have
a
case,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
it
was
filed,
if
a
claim
was
filed
before
the
policy
lapse,
do
you
have
a
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
still
do.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
what
i'm
suggesting.
is
there
anything
in
this
that
says
that
was
not
the
fact?
this
went
off
on
the
complaint.
there's
no
proof,
so
we
don't
know
what
the
plaintiff
would
have
prove
in
this
regard,
do
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
on
the
motion
or
that
he
construed
most
favorably
that
they
pleaded
on
this
motion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
wrinkle,
may
i
ask,
does
your
argument
add
up
to
this
that
you
can
see
that
you
have
to
prove
death
but
you
say
that
proving
it
or
having
alleged
it
sufficiently
to
justify
the
influence
of
death
in
1943?
nevertheless,
because
the
seven-year
presumption,
you
had
to
wait
until
the
end
of
the
seven
years
before
you
could
bring
in
action.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
may
i
ask
another
question,
does
at
any
part
of
your
argument
today
that
there's
to
be
an
inference
from
this
complaint
or
that
any
is
justified
that
a
claim
was
made
with
the
veterans
administration
during
the
seven-year
period?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you're
not
relying
on
that.
