mr.
george
s.
leonard
the
government
moved
in
the
trial
court
to
dismiss
the
complaint
on
two
separate
grounds
considered
with
the
alternatives.
first,
that
it
was
brought
after
the
time
limited,
and
second,
that
it
fairly
state
the
cause
of
action
in
any
event.
the
trial
court
held
--
repelled
to
state
cause
of
action,
did
not
reach
the
other
question.
the
--
the
sixth
circuit
reached
the
limitations
question
decided
the
action
had
been
brought
too
late
and
alternatively
affirmed
the
trial
court
on
the
--
of
the
point.
i
would,
if
i
may,
first
take
up
the
limitation's
point
since
i
think
it
is
critical
to
this
case
and
is
indirect
conflict
with
the
willhite
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
as
to
the
ability
of
this
complaint
to
state
the
cause
of
action
that
cannot
of
course
be
a
conflict.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
that
could
be
said,
either
way,
sir.
otherwise,
we
would
not
reach
the
question
of
the
cause
of
action
if
the
action
could
not
have
been
brought
in
the
first
place
by
reason
of
limitations
or
without
regard
to
the
limitation's
question,
we
might
say
that
as
brought,
it
fails
to
state
the
cause
of
action
in
any
event.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
on
the
second
point,
there
is
no
conflict.
on
the
first
point,
we
have
a
direct
conflict
between
the
only
other
case
interpreting
the
statute,
which
is
united
states
against
willhite
in
which
the
majority
held
the
six-year
period
under
the
statute
commends
that
the
end
of
seven
years
absence.
and
it
is
that,
i
would
like
to
address
myself,
too,
if
i
may.
this
insured
was
in
the
army
for
three
months
training.
from
the
time
of
his
induction
at
that
point,
his
battalion
was
ordered
overseas
and
he
failed
to
report.
he
had
never
been
heard
of
since.
those
are
the
basic
facts.
when
he
was
inducted,
he
took
out
the
$10,000
national
service
life
insurance
contract
which
is
here
in
question,
four
premiums
were
paid
and
after
his
disappearance,
it
lapsed.
no
further
premiums
were
paid.
no
waiver
was
applied
for.
there
was
nothing
further
to
it.
accordingly,
this
case
does
and
must
rest
on
the
proposition
that
the
insured
died
before
the
lapse
of
that
policy
in
the
summer
of
1943,
the
statute
which
this
--
fixed
it
the
time
within
which
an
action
can
be
commenced.
in
section
617
of
the
national
service
life
insurance
act,
we
found
on
page
39
of
the
government's
brief,
and
which
simply
refers
the
question
over
to
the
appropriate
provisions
of
the
word
war
veterans
act
of
1924,
section
19.
and
if
i
may,
i
should
like
to
read
section
19
as
it
fixes
the
basic
limitations
period
with
which
we
are
here
concerned.
no
suit
on
united
states
government
life
converted
insurance
shall
be
allowed
under
this
section
unless
the
same
shall
have
been
brought
within
six
years
after
the
right
accrued
for
which
the
claim
is
made
or
had
this
statute
stopped
at
that
point.
this
question
of
what
was
meant
by
the
word
"accrued"
might
well
be
one
in
some
doubt.
however,
the
statute
went
on
to
say,
provided,
that
for
the
purposes
of
this
section,
it
shall
be
deemed
that
the
right
accrued
on
the
happening
of
the
contingency
on
which
the
claim
was
founded.
that
clause
came
to
this
court
in
a
world
war
veterans
--
war
risk
--
mr.
george
s.
leonard
on
page
40
in
the
center,
section
19
of
the
world
war
veterans
insurance
act.
the
first
provided
the
clause
that
for
the
purposes
of
this
section,
it
shall
be
deemed
that
the
right
accrued
on
the
happening
of
the
contingency
on
which
the
claim
is
founded.
that
specific
clause
came
to
this
court
in
the
towery
case,
the
united
states
against
towery.
and
this
court
held
that
the
only
contingency
was
total
disability
or
death.
i
might
say
assigned
that
world
war
i
insurance,
so-called
war
risk
insurance,
provided
for
a
payment
on
either
disability
or
death.
the
national
service
life
insurance
is
only
for
death
and
not
for
disability.
disability
permits
waiver
but
not
payment
in
the
same
sense
with
the
older
insurance.
this
court
held
that
the
only
contingency
that
congress
had
provided
for
within
the
meaning
of
this
phrase
was
total
disability
or
death.
in
the
present
action,
the
willhite
court--
the
willhite
majority
agreed
with
this
court
and
i
quote
from
their
decision.
"the
contingency
on
which
the
claim
is
founded
is
the
death
of
the
insured."
therefore,
the
only
fact
which
will
stop
the
statute
of
limitations
within
the
statute
here
is
the
death
of
the
insured.
and
as
i
have
pointed
out,
that
death
must
have
occurred
while
this
insurance
policy
was
enforced,
i.e.
in
the
summer
of
1943.
the
statute
gave
such
six
years,
thereafter,
to
bring
suit
on
the
matter.
this
action
was
commenced
11
years,
thereafter.
the
difference
is
to
be
found
--
the
difference
is
accounted
for
in
willhite
by
the
reception
into
the
national
service
life
insurance
act
of
what
is
referred
to
as
a
general
presumption
in
insurance
cases.
and
as
to
that
presumption,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
because
the
majority
in
willhite,
unlike
the
sixth
circuit
below,
took
that
as
applying
despite
the
terms
of
this
statute,
the
national
service
life
insurance.
the
statute
provides
a
specific
presumption,
the
proof
of
death
at
the
end
of
seven
years.
it
was
read
to
you
by
mr.
wrinkle.
and
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
get
the
specific
language
of
that
section,
again,
turning
back
in
section
610
of
the
national
service
life
insurance
act.
it
is
no
part
of
the
world
war
i,
the
world
war
veterans
act
of
1924,
that
states
first,
no
state
law
providing
for
presumption
of
death
shall
be
applicable
to
claims
for
national
service
life
insurance.
that
section
was
set
out
in
the
willhite
case.
that
particular
sentence
was
never
discussed.
it
then
follows
as
mr.
wrinkle
read
it,
evidence
satisfactory
to
the
administrative
being
presented,
death
may
be
presumed
and
i
quote
“as
of
the
date
of
the
expiration
of
such
period”
--
that's
the
seven
years
--
so
that
we
have
two
possibilities
here.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
could
rely
on
actual
death
and
bring
suit
at
anytime
within
six
years.
on
the
other
hand,
she
could
take
advantage
of
the
presumption
which
congress
gave
her
and
simply
rest
on
that
at
the
end
of
the
seven
years
by
merely
keeping
the
insurance
and
force
up
to
that
point
or
alternatively
by
applying
for
waiver.
she
could
have
brought
the
insurance
up
to
the
seven
year
period
and
without
any
of
the
proof
of
these
elements,
disabilities
or,
otherwise,
that
were
alleged
in
the
present
case
had
set
back
and
rested
on
the
total
and
completely
unexplained
absence
of
the
insured
on
the
presumption
which
congress
gave
her.
and
then
truly,
the
time
would
have
extended
for
another
six
years
because
having
kept
the
insurance
in
full,
she
could
rest
the
death
at
the
end
of
the
seven
years
precisely
as
the
statute
provided.
having
done
neither,
it
is
necessary
for
the
petitioner
in
this
case
to
prove
that
the
insured
died
twice.
first,
he
has
to
presumptively
die
at
the
end
of
the
seven
years
under
the
statute
in
order
to
avoid
the
statute
of
limitations
problem
of
six
years.
but
then,
he
has
to
die
actually
at
the
beginning
of
the
seven
years
in
order
to
bring
it
within
the
effective
period
of
the
insurance
since
the
premiums
weren't
paid.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
we
are
here
on
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
as
taken
under
the
motion
to
dismiss.
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
do
not
set
forth
anything
on
that,
sir.
in
effect,
the
complaint
leaves
the
impression
that
they
got
the
last
word
on
july
30,
1943,
that
he
regularly
visited
home,
that
he
regularly
wrote.
in
other
words,
that
almost
immediately,
they
would
know.
they
also
alleged
than
an
immediate
search
by
everyone
concern,
the
army,
the
fbi
and
others
to
place,
so
again,
they
must
have
been
alerted
to
that.
they
must
have
known
after
about
the
time
that
he
failed
to
show
up
when
the
battalion
was
ordered
out.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
well,
i
presume
in
april
of
1943.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
there's
nothing
or
whatever
in
the
record
to
--
mr.
george
s.
leonard
because
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
are
that
the
son
was
completely
dependent
on
the
family.
it
was
a
very
close
relationship.
he
had
taken
out
this
insurance.
he
had
named
his
mother
as
the
beneficiary.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
and
to
say,
otherwise,
we'd
pay
to
presume
he
never
told
her
about
it.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
well,
i
can
only
say
this
mr.
chief
justice.
the
normal
advice
given,
as
i
understand
it,
certainly
the
advice
given
to
me
under
similar
circumstances
was
to
take
that
policy
and
send
it
to
the
beneficiary
immediately
so
that
they
can
hold
it.
you
see,
they
--
they
actually
give
you
a
little
policy
in
the
normal
things,
not
to
carry
it
around
with
you
in
service,
but
to
shift
it
off
to
the
beneficiary.
it's
like
this
air
insurance
policy
you
should
take
out
at
the
airport.
you
mail
them
off
as
quickly
as
possible.(voice

--
mr.
george
s.
leonard
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
not
a
word,
sir.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
and
i'll
--
mr.
wrinkle,
do
you
know
anything
to
the
contrary?
mr.
george
s.
leonard
no,
he
--
four
payments
amounting
to
$26
had
been
deducted
from
his
pay
to
be
--
waiver
could
have
been
accomplished
at
anytime
after
august
1,
1947,
under
amendments
to
the
act.
the
insurance
had
been
kept
enforced
for
a
period
of
six
months
under
premium
paying
conditions.
the
allegations
of
the
present
complaint
are
that
he
was
totally
disabled.
and
total
disability,
of
course,
is
the
basic
ground
for
waiver
of
this
type
of
insurance.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
i
have
no
knowledge
how
they
account
for
that,
sir.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
well,
i
--
i
do
know
that
there
are
number
of
cases
which
have
held
that
the
premiums
cannot
be
paid
by
this
amount
which
even
the
veterans
administration
declares
to
the
policy
holders
under
these
payments
they
make
from
time
to
time
of
the
excess.
its
been
held
that
a
premium
must
be
paid
in
every
case
by
the
insured.
i
should
be
glad
to
give
the
court
a
memorandum
on
that
point
if
it
is
interested.
in
other
words,
the
united
states
government
does
not
seek
around
for
money
to
someone's
account
in
order
to
pay
the
premiums.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show,
sir.
i'd
be
glad
to
run
that
down
as
a
matter
of
import.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
i
have
an
idea
that
when
a
person
is
charged
with
being
absent
without
leave
and
possible
suspicion
of
being
a
deserter
that
they
forfeit
the
money.
i'm
not
at
all
certain
and
i
--
i
cannot
make
that
statement
with
any
assurance.
i'd
be
glad
to
run
it
down
and
let
the
court
know.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
no
official
action
has
been
taken.
he
was
absent
without
leave
on
his
record.
since
he
wasn't
brought
back,
there
was
no
necessity
of
deciding
whether
a
charge
was
being
made
or
not.
it's
simply
that
he
failed
to
report.
he's
never
been
heard
of
since.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
well,
sir,
let's
assume
that
of
his
monthly
pay,
about
$70,
had
been
applied
to
the
payment
of
premiums
here.
they
would
have
kept
it
alive
long
enough
that
the
beneficiary
could
have
applied
for
waiver.
she
never
did.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
no,
sir,
no,
sir.
they
would
--
it
was
not
applied
to
the
--
mr.
george
s.
leonard
no,
i'm
merely
saying
that
if
you
assumed
a
condition
where
the
money
had
been
applied,
this
case
would
still
be
here
for
the
reason
that
while
it
might
extend
it
for
another
seven
or
eight
months,
it
would
still
be
five
years
short
of
the
statutory
time.
in
other
words,
it
could
have
been
done
but
it
wouldn't
have
changed
any
--
any
result.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
for
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
have
not
made
any
such
statement.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
i'm
not
on
the
limitation's
side
like
we
--
mr.
george
s.
leonard
well,
sir,
your
question
--
mr.
george
s.
leonard
well,
it's
quite
--
it's
quite
apparent
but
i've
not
made
myself
clear
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
for
the
first
six
years
based
upon
the
allegations
which
she
know
says
can
prove
death
in
the
summer
of
1943,
she
could
have
brought
an
action
and
prove
death
in
the
summer
of
1943
at
any
time,
presumptions
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
it,
by
the
common
law,
general
statutory,
or
otherwise.
in
other
words,
she
either
had
a
cause
of
action
for
death
in
the
summer
of
1943
or
she
hasn't
proved
of
it.
i
mean,
it's
a
very
simple
problem.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
what's
that?
mr.
george
s.
leonard
the
argument
at
the
present
time
is
that
this
complaint
states
the
cause
of
action
which
will
prove
death
in
1943.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
that's
the
claim
and
that's
why
we're
up
in
this
court,
your
honor,
it's
the
claim.
this
was
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
--
on
the
particular
ground
that
accepting
everything
they
said,
it
couldn't
be
true
anyway.
but
the
petitioner's
position
necessarily
is
that
she
has
stated
facts
sufficient
to
prove
death
in
1943
because
the
insurance
run
out
in
1943.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
well,
the
last
payment
was
in
july,
a
grace
period
which
carried
it
through
until
about
the
end
of
august
1943.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
no,
your
honor.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
after
the
seven
years
have
gone,
she
made
the
application.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
this
--
this
is
controlled
by
the
complaint.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
all
of
those
is
made
due
application.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
that
is
that
--
that
is
not
pleading.
that's
a
statement
of
loss
clearer
on
his
face.
that's
the
whole
issue
on
this
trial.
the
fact
that
they
state
that
the
six-year
--
mr.
george
s.
leonard
you
mean
before
the
six-year?
mr.
george
s.
leonard
the
policy
lapsed
in
six
years
after
the
end
of
july
1943,
i.e.
july
1950.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
no,
quite
--
quite
contrary,
quite
contrary.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
yes,
indeed.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
oh
surely.
the
statute
provides
withholding
under
two
circumstances
during
the
pendency
of
a
claim
filed
with
the
administration,
which
as
the
complaint
through
which
you
pointed
out
indicates,
there
were
advised
1951
that
the
claim
had
been
denied.
so
that
you
have
another
three
years
after
that
before
the
action
was
brought,
so
you
take
the
time
up
to
the
filing
of
this.
you
have
to
assume
that
it
was
not
on
only
filed
before
in
the
absence
of
any
allegation.
you
not
only
have
to
assume
that
it
was
filed
before
the
six
years,
but
three
years
before
the
six
years
lapsed
and
it
was
held
by
the
veterans
administration
for
a
period
of
four
or
five
years.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
it
seems
to
me
that
his
questions
were
the
burdens
on
the
plaintiff
to
establish
the
passage
of
time
to
set
down
the
dates.
the
fact
that
we
know,
it's
to
the
contrary
is
not
governing
and
that
is
true.
and
there
is
not,
as
far
as
i
know,
any
actual
statement
of
the
date.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
most
favorably
to
the
plaintiff.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
that's
--
that's
what
he
claims.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
in
other
words,
the
petitioner's
case
here
is
that
petitioner
must
use
the
presumption
of
death
at
the
end
of
seven
years
in
order
to
get
the
13-year
period
within
which
to
fit
this
suit
11
years
after
what
they
claimed
as
the
actual
death.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
well,
that
is
precisely
our
point,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
now,
the
only
thing
i'm
trying
to
make
--
mr.
george
s.
leonard
well,
the
statement
was
made
by
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
there's
no
way
of
telling
how
many
years
may
have
passed
during
which
this
matter
was
before
the
veterans
administration.
now,
the
tendency
of
a
claim
before
the
veterans
administration
is
a
tolling
fact.
there
are
two
kinds
of
tolling
under
this
act,
legal
disability
and
pendency
of
a
claim.
there
is
not
the
so-called
seven-year
tolling
which
is
referred
to
by
petitioner.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
yes,
we
know
when
the
claim
was
filed.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
in
--
about
april,
1951.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
no,
not
the
suit
but
the
claim
to
the
veterans
administration.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
it
was
in
the
--
mr.
george
s.
leonard
i
don't
like
to
go
outside
the
record
on
that.
we
happen
to
know
it
but
--
mr.
george
s.
leonard
i
should
say
no.
i
would
have
thought
that
was
--
mr.
george
s.
leonard
--
i
thought
i
should
have
thought
it
was
illegal
conclusion
rather
than
a
pleading
effect.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
i
cannot
follow
that
because
mr.
justice
brennan
is
perfectly
correct
that,
as
far
as
the
pleading
in
this
case
is
concerned,
it
does
not
state
the
amount
of
time
that
this
was
spending
before
the
veterans
administration.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
that
would
be
a
condition
which
lifted
the
bar,
if
so
pleaded
and
intended,
and
the
proper
period
have
--
mr.
george
s.
leonard
if
i
may
move
on
just
for
one
further
statement,
we've
taken
the
willhite
position
and
the
howard
decisions
on
which
it
relies,
the
two
court
members
in
willhite
quoted
at
great
length
from
the
howard
case.
the
howard
case,
a
district
court
case
in
washington
in
turn
quoted
at
great
length
from
the
howard
case,
the
state
court
case.
now,
this
--
this
--
this
chain
of
language
from
the
state
court
case
is
found
right
through
these
three
decisions.
all
i
want
to
say
at
this
time
is
that
to
note
that
in
reading
it,
the
state
court
was
deciding
the
meaning
of
the
word
accrual
in
a
state
statute
of
limitations.
it
had
none
of
this
--
none
of
the
federal
limitations
before
us.
that
was
recognized
by
judge
(inaudible)
in
the
federal
howard
case,
what
said
he,
it
is
a
general
law,
nevertheless,
and
we'll
apply.
there
is
this
much
to
be
said
for
that
decision.
it
was
under
the
world
war
veterans
act
which
did
not
have
this
presumption
clause
or
the
limitation
against
the
use
of
state
law
so
that
it
is
really
only
with
willhite
that
we
come
flatly
up
against
the
fact
that
by
adopting
howard
which
in
turn
adopted
state
law
and
by
referring
solely
to
what
is
known
as
general
law,
which
is
i
understand
it
to
be,
is
state
law.
willhite
has
found
that
despite
the
fixed
presumption
in
the
statute,
you
may
use
general
law
such
as
it
is
which
i
take
to
be
state
law
against
the
statement
and
the
statute
that
no
state
law
shall
be
effective.
and
that
i
think
is,
well,
willhite
went
beyond
the
holdings
of
this
court
and
willhite
was
very
careful
to
set
out
the
mciver
against
ragan
cases
and
the
others
in
this
court
leading
up
to
and
of
course
it
did
not
quote
the
soriano
case
at
the
last
term.
all
of
which
hold
to
the
strict
construction
of
these
limits
of
--
statutes
of
limitation
in
these
suits.
but,
the
willhite
majority
went
on
to
say
and
i
can
quote
precisely
the
whole
basis
for
this
action
being
up
here
and
the
discrepancy.
however,
in
life
insurance
case
--
cases,
the
courts
have
uniformly
applied
a
different
rule
and
it
cites
three
annotations
in
alr.
all
of
which,
of
course,
are
state
cases,
the
willhite
case
and
this
case
are
the
only
two
national
service
life
insurance
cases,
the
only
two
concerning
the
presumption
which
congress
put
in
to
the
statute.
