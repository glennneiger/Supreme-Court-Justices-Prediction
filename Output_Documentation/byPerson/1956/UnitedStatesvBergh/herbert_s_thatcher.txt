mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
if
the
court
please.
the
1885
resolution
of
congress,
which
is
the
basis
for
the
respondent's
claim
in
this
case,
has
as
this
court
observed
in
kelly
when
the
matter
was
first
before
it
then
applied
and
construe
it
for
over
40
years
prior
to
the
1938
resolution
on
which
the
government
relies
to
require
a
holiday
allowance
for
per
diem
governmental
employees,
the
per
diem
employees,
roughly,
the
blue
collar
employees
of
the
government.
now,
this
--
this
holiday
allowance
has
no
relation
to
whether
the
individual
actually
worked
or
not.
it's
--
it
is
a
gratuity,
as
the
government
claim,
payable
on
the
occurrence
of
the
holiday.
if
the
individual
happens
to
work
on
a
holiday,
he
is
to
be
paid
at
his
regular
compensation
which
was
done
here,
straight
time
and
of
course
no
claim
is
being
made
for
that.
the
reason
for
the
allowance
of
a
holiday
gratuity
by
the
congress
had
been
explained
somewhat
by
counsel
for
the
government
in
the
case
of
where
the
employee
does
not
work
on
the
holiday,
for
the
per
diem
employee
who
does
not
work
on
a
holiday,
it
was
to
equalize
him
with
the
per
annum
--
per
annum
employee
who
was
paid
even
though
he
did
not
work.
in
the
case
where
the
employee
did
work
on
a
holiday,
it
would
to
compensate
him
for
the
extra
burden
he
was
put
to
in
giving
up
his
--
a
day
usually
devoted
to
either
religious
devotions
or
patriotic
observance
or
recreation.
now,
the
sole
question
in
--
in
this
case
is
whether
that
1885
resolution
on
which
we
rely
entirely
has
been
repealed
by
the
1938
resolution
insofar
as
the
1885
resolution
does
allow
the
holiday
gratuity
and
has
about
four
years
prior
to
the
1938
resolution.
the
entire
question
has
been
submitted
and
argued
twice
before
the
court
of
claims
and
twice
the
issue
has
been
resolved
against
the
government.
it
was
here
in
kelly,
but
in
kelly,
this
court
decided
the
case
on
a
different
basis,
namely,
the
particular
contract
involved
there
between
the
government
employee,
the
printing
office
employee
and
the
government.
here,
we
have
no
such
contract.
we
rely
solely
on
the
1885
statute.
now,
one
would
suppose
that
if
congress
really
intended
to
overturn
or
repeal
so
deeply
embedded
a
--
in
longstanding,
a
practice
of
holiday
allowances,
it
would
have
done
so
in
response
to
complaints
or
criticism
of
the
practice
or
it
was
made
of
some
study
or
consideration
of
the
questions
involved
and
certainly,
that
have
--
would
have
used
very
clear
and
precise
language
in
repealing
that
long
--
low
established
practice.
yet,
exactly,
the
opposite
is
true.
the
congressional
history,
as
i
will
show
shortly
in
little
more
detail,
contains
that
solely
with
no
complaints
of
criticism,
no
suggestions
that
the
--
the
holiday
allowance
to
the
per
diem
--
per
diem
employee
was
in
anyway
unjust
or
inequitable
or
too
expensive
or
for
any
reason
whatsoever
should
be
abolished
and
there
was
no
discussion
of
the
problem
in
that
entire
history
and
there
is
no
language
of
repeal.
let
us
look
for
a
minute
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
no,
it
deals
--
with
an
entirely
different
subject.
the
1938
resolution
deals
with
the
subject
of
what
to
do
when
a
--
when
a
per
diem
employee
is
called
--
loses
his
holiday
--
is
--
is
not
paid
--
is
not
employed
because
the
holiday
occurs
on
a
nonworking
day,
on
a
--
ordinarily
it
wouldn't
work
anyway
like
--
like
a
saturday
or
a
sunday.
the
1885
resolution
has
application
only
to
various
calls
of
work
on
a
regular
workday,
which
is
a
holiday
--
which
is
also
a
holiday.
you
see,
the
two
statutes
don't
deal
with
those
--
deal
with
two
separate
things.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
it's
set
forth
on
page
2
of
the
government's
brief,
page
2
in
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
yes,
your
honor.
and
that
was
construed
by
the
comptroller
general
for
over
40
years.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
the
1938
resolution
states
that
the
--
the
government
per
diem
employee
shall
receive
his
holiday
allowance
only
when
--
or
not
only,
but
on
the
--
when
working
--
when
he
is
relieved
or
prevented
from
working
solely
because
of
the
occurrence
of
a
holiday.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
it
does
not
deal
and
as
this
court
noted
in
--
in
kelly,
it
is
entirely
silent
as
to
what
happened
when
he
is
called
to
work
on
a
regular
working
day,
which
is
a
holiday.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
the
1938
resolution
does
not
touch
that
subject
at
all.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
it
does,
your
honor.
and
--
and
that
resolution
requires
the
holiday
allowance
in
addition
to
the
regular
pay
for
that
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
--
day.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
is
the
question
in
this
case.
is
it
repealed?
there's
a
higher
question
in
this
case.
is
the
1885
statute
repealed?
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
to
the
extent
of
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
--
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
the
government
has
to
show
a
conflict
between
them.
we
say
there
is
no
conflict
between
them
that
they
can
be
applied
and
construed
together
with
no
conflict
except
as
to
the
matter
of
paying
a
--
of
paying
a
per
diem
worker
his
holiday
allowance
when
he
wouldn't
been
called
to
work
in
any
event.
that
is
what
the
1938
statute
deals
with
as
we'll
see
by
the
congressional
history,
that
is
all
that
congress
was
concerned
with.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
yes.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
there
is
no
question
that
the
claim
involved.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
the
claim
involved.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
is
one
part
of
it.
we
have
to
go
to
congressional
history
to
see
exactly
what
it
meant.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
but
i
think
if
we
apply
the
bare
language
even
of
section
2,
it
is
obvious
that
there's
no
outright
repeal
that
there
is
a
repeal
only
to
the
extent
of
such
--
of
any
inconsistency,
only
to
that
extent.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
we
claim
you
don't.
we
claim
that
on
its
face,
there
is
no
inconsistency
in
the
matter
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
--
of
the
claim
that
we
make.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
our
contention
here.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
i
don't
see
how
we
can
by
the
bare
language
or
the
punctuation
or
--
or
any
other
tenant
of
--
of
statutory
construction
that
i'm
aware
of.
if
it
says
read
literally,
it
certainly
doesn't.
the
phrase
“to
the
extent”
must
apply
to
both
the
joint
resolution
and
all
other
laws,
it
must
as
a
matter
of
plain
english.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
it's
--
there
would
--
there
would
have
to
be
other
punctuation
then
and
if
you
wanted
to
limit
the
--
the
phrase
to
the
extent
of
such
inconsistency
to
the
latter
part
of
this
--
of
section
2,
i
should
think.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
yes,
or
after
act.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
or
--
pardon?
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
or
i
should
think
that
time
was
actually
--
did
intent
an
actual
repeal
it
could
--
there
would
--
very
normally
that
said
the
joint
resolution
of
january
6,
1885
is
repealed
and
all
other
laws
inconsistent
or
in
conflict
with
the
provision
of
this
act
i
repeal
to
the
extent
of
any
inconsistency.
i
could
think
that
would
have
been
the
normal
thing
to
do.
yet,
congress
did
not
do
that
and
as
we
will
see
for
a
very
good
reason
because
it
was
not
concerned
with
repealing
anything
that's
filed
in
its
entirety
at
all.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
there's
no
evidence
in
the
entire
legislative
history
that
there
was
any
intent
to
repeal
that
1885
act
in
its
entirety
at
all.
i'll
come
to
that
in
a
--
in
a
minute.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
yes,
the
1885
to
the
extent
of
any
inconsistency
is
of
course
repealed.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
as
was
well
as
any
other
law.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
we
haven't
found
any
or
made
any
contention
in
--
in
respect
of
any
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
is
right,
your
honor.
as
--
as
i
--
as
i
started
to
say
a
minute
ago,
going
on
beyond
the
language
of
the
--
of
the
repeal
or
clause
which
i
don't
think
in
any
normal
construction
can
be
read
as
an
absolute
repeal
of
the
1885
act.
certainly,
congress
would
have
given
much
more
perfect
language
so
that's
been
intended.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
a
great
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
i
think
--
i
think
there
was
a
great
deal
of
light
in
the
legislative
history
to
show
that
congress
did
not
intend
an
absolute
repeal.
and
i'll
come
to
that
right
now,
if
i
may.
as
counsel
for
the
government
stated,
this
whole
matter
of
the
1938
resolution
was
precipitated
by
a
--
a
very
harmless
thing
--
the
president
had
declared
december
24th,
1937
as
a
holiday.
december
24th,
1937,
is
a
holiday
which
put
the
per
diem
employee
out
of
work
for
that
day
with
no
compensation
whereas
the
per
annum
employee
did
receive
compensation
for
that
day.
the
remedy
that
--
that
one
--
that
one
oversight,
a
resolution
was
introduced
by
congressman
ramspeck
to
give
the
per
diem
holiday
to
pay
for
that
day,
that
day
only.
when
it
got
to
civil
service
commission,
the
civil
service
commission
send
a
letter
over
to
the
house
committee
which
is
considering
this
particular
ramspeck
bill
and
suggested
well
it
might
as
well
appear
to
this
whole
problem
of
the
presidentially
or
administratively
the
three
holidays
at
one
--
in
one
piece
of
legislation
and
therefore
suggested
that
the
--
the
legislation
instead
of
just
making
the
one
pay
on
a
power
--
for
--
for
purpose
of
per
diem
pay
on
a
power
of
grant
of
pay
that
all
presidentially
declared
holidays
be
accorded
the
same
weight
and
respect
to
per
diem
holiday
allowances
as
in
respect
to
the
per
anum
and
that
was
done.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
there
is
no
pay
for
time
of
it.
no,
there'
no
pay
for
coming
to
that.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
except
the
regular
pay.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
no.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
no.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
no
--
no,
the
--
the
1938
resolution
did
add
two
extra
holidays,
i
forgot
which,
i
think
--
or
one
extra
holiday
to
the
list
of
previously
prescribed
holidays,
so
that
the
per
annum
or
per
diem
employee
would
receive
his
holiday
allowance
on
that
day
as
well,
to
being
a
statutory
declared
holiday.
in
addition
--
in
addition
the
state
of
that
any
presidentially
declared
holidays
shall
upraise
the
per
diem
allowance
day
for
--
holiday
for
the
per
diem
employee.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
no,
it's
an
additional.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
except
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
except
--
it's
unaffected
--
except
in
the
case
of
a
--
of
an
inconsistency.
that
is
not
any
of
inconsistency.
that's
an
additional.
the
addition
of
the
presidentially
declared
holiday
is
an
addition,
a
benefit
--
an
additional
benefit
to
the
per
diem.
the
addition,
i
think,
of
one
extra
statutorily
declared
holiday.
it's
an
addition,
not
of
any
inconsistencies.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
it
is
not.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
since
under
the
1938
act
that
that
was
presidentially
declared
or
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
he
will
get
double
pay
for
that
day.
that
was
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
1938
resolution
specifically
to
expand
the
holidays
in
which
a
per
diem
employee
got
the
additional
holiday
allowance.
that
was
one
of
the
very
specific
purposes,
that
was
the
initial
reason
for
the
resolution
to
begin
with.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
the
only
--
the
only
inconsistency
is
in
relation
to
the
previous
practice
of
paying
a
per
diem
holiday
for
--
for
a
holiday
where
he
would
not
work
in
any
event
because
it
was
on
a
saturday
--
declared
on
a
saturday
or
a
sunday
of
some
day
like
that
where
he
wouldn't
work
anyway.
previously,
the
congress
--
previously
the
practice
had
been
to
pay
the
per
diem
employee
his
regular
day's
wages
even
though
he
didn't
come
to
work.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
in
that
particular,
deliberately
cutout
that
particular
benefit
for
the
per
diem
employee.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
pardon
me.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
is
inconsistent,
that
to
that
extent,
the
1885
act
was,
in
effect,
repealed
when
there's
no
contrary
contention
for
that.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
if
an
employee
works
for
--
for
per
diem
employee,
if
he's
called
to
work
on,
say,
thanksgiving
day
and
that's
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
any
--
any
of
these
holidays,
he
has
paid
a
straight
time.
his
regular
time,
whatever
that
might
be
then
he
is
paid
a
holiday
allowance.
as
a
holiday
allowance
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
of
a
sum
equivalent
--
equivalent
to
a
straight
time
pay.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
so,
it
would
be
double
pay.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
he
doesn't
work.
he
receives
his
straight
time
pay.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
whatever
the
contract
calls
but
in
this
case,
we
have
no
contract.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
he
will
get
time
and
a
half.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
i
--
i
don't
know
what
the
employees
actually
got
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
in
the
kelly
case,
he
got
250%
by
virtue
of
the
statue
and
the
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
by
the
agreement,
well,
that's
all
they
got
in
kelly.
he
didn't
--
he
didn't
get
his
--
his
regular
per
diem
or
his
holiday
allowance.
he
got
the
contract
allowance.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
which
was
by
a
contract.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
by
contract.
that's
correct.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
this
court
in
the
kelly
held
that
the
statute
made
no
difference
that
the
contract
governs.
and
that's
why
this
court
in
kelly
passed
over
the
construction
of
kelly
because
it
said
without
this,
what
the
statute
does
and
does
not
hold,
we
hold
that
the
contract
governs
and
therefore
he's
entitled
to
the
250%
if
that's
what
it
were.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
double
pay.
in
the
kelly
case,
that
was
one
of
the
thing.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
it
recognized
the
gratuity
of
that
contract.
it
had
a
gratuity
by
contract
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
--
it
was
two-and-a-half.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
i
shouldn't
think
so.
this
court
so
held
--
the
court
held
that
we
don't
have
to
consider
whether
the
act
did
or
did
not
so
intend
in
any
event
the
contract
governs.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that's
what
the
kelly
holds.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
yes,
so
--
so
congress
had
actually
--
had
actually
purposely
repealed
all
this
whole
idea
of
gratuity
holiday
allowances,
i
shouldn't
think
the
contract
with
--
the
court
wouldn't
be
able
to
hold
as
it
did
in
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
--
kelly.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that's
all.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that's
all.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
the
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
three.
the
court
and
the
clients
ought
to
hold.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
it
must
be
the
reason,
otherwise
that
the
holding
couldn't
have
been
as
it
was.
now,
returning
to
the
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
because
--
solely
because
of
the
occurrence
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
--
of
the
holiday.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
solely.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
we
say
--
we
say
that
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
we
say
that
the
1938
resolution
applies
only
to
the
situation
of
where
he
is
relieved
or
--
or
prevented
or
not
called
to
work
because
of
the
occurrence
of
a
holiday.
it
doesn't
treat
at
all
and
by
its
terms
it
does
now
buying
the
face
of
the
1938
resolution
itself,
it
does
not
treat
at
all
with
the
subject
of
what
happens
when
a
person
is
called
to
work.
and
this
court,
in
the
kelly
case,
expressly
so
pointed
out
--
so
held.
it
pointed
out
that
the
1938
resolution
is
entirely
silent
on
the
question
of
what
happens
when
a
per
diem
employee
is
called
to
work
on
a
holiday,
entirely
silent
on
that
subject.
we
claim
that
when
he's
called
to
work
on
a
holiday
which
occurs
on
a
regular
working
day
as
the
things
from
a
non-working
day
where
he
wouldn't
work
anyway
that
he's
entitled
to
his
holiday
allowance
in
addition
to
his
regular
pay
--
his
double
pay.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
unless
the
1885
is
repealed.
if
it's
not
repealed,
the
1885
gave
them
the
right
to
the
gratuity.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
being
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
yes.
well,
look
--
look
the
1938
added
thanksgiving
to
the
list
of
holidays
which
--
on
which
to
prevent
employees
entitled
to
his
holiday
allowance
because
of
that.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
yes.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
no.
yes,
but
he
is
not
--
the
1938
resolution
didn't
deal
with
what
happens
when
he's
called
to
work.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
prevention
is
when
he
doesn't
return
to
work.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
is
right.
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that's
right.
that's
the
government's
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
is
one
of
the
anomalies
created
by
the
government's
contention
about
their
construction
of
this
act.
that
a
man
who
stays
home
gets
exactly
the
same
pay
as
the
man
who
goes
to
work
which
isn't
--
wouldn't
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
we
say
that
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
for
over
--
for
--
for
over
40
years
prior
to
1938,
that
was
the
fact
in
the
case
and
there
was
no
word
raised
in
congress
or
anywhere
else
that
that
created
any
particular
inequity.
the
per
annum
employee
has
other
benefits.
many
of
the
benefits,
we
set
forth
some
of
them
in
our
brief
which
the
per
diem
employee
does
not.
he
doesn't
have
the
hazards
of
employment
principle
that
the
per
diem
blue
collar
worker
does.
he
doesn't
work
when
it
rains.
he
--
he
works
half
day
sometimes.
his
job
stopped
when
the
work
is
ended,
when
the
picker's
job
is
unresolved,
sort
of
differences
between
the
two
classes
testifying
a
difference
in
that
particular
respect.
and
as
i
said,
no
complaint
ever
was
made
or
no
objection
raised
because
of
that
differential
between
per
annum
and
governmental.
but
getting
back
to
this
legislative
history
for
just
a
minute,
as
i
said
before
there
is
no
mention
of
whatsoever
in
that
legislative
history
in
the
report
or
in
any
discussion
on
the
floor
that
anyone
was
complaining
on
the
side
that
they're
making
any
objection
to
this
practice
of
paying
a
per
diem
employee
a
holiday
allowance
in
addition
to
his
regular
work
when
he
did
work
on
--
actually
work
on
a
holiday.
there
is
not
a
word
of
complaint
about
that
practice
which
the
government
claims
has
been
repealed
and
which
congress
intended
to
repeal
in
1938,
not
a
word
on
it.
the
only
word
that
--
a
complaint
that
we
do
find
is
in
respect
to
this
business
of
calling
or
--
or
paying
a
per
diem
employee
for
a
holiday
--
on
a
holiday
when
he
wasn't
called
to
work,
when
he
wouldn't
been
--
been
called
to
work
in
any
event
because
that
was
a
saturday
or
a
sunday
or
some
other
day
of
nonworking
day.
there
was
a
complaint
about
that
in
the
--
in
a
letter
written
by
the
comptroller
or
in
a
--
in
a
letter
written
by
the
comptroller
which
was
given
to
the
house
committee.
but
that
is
the
only
practice
of
which
there
was
any
complaint
at
all.
now,
it
doesn't
seem
--
it
doesn't
seem
reasonable
that
congress
would
actually
had
intended
--
actually
had
or
was
intending
to
repeal
all
aspects
of
holiday
pay
as
contended
for
by
the
government
except
the
single
situation
of
where
an
employee
is
prevented
from
working
solely
because
of
the
occurrence
of
the
holiday
without
some
discussions
in
congress
or
complaints
being
made
or
--
or
objection
was
being
made
for
the
other
practices
without
a
little
more
of
studies
and
was
given
to
that
problem
and
certainly
without
very
express
and
explicit
language
to
that
effect
but
the
manner
on
which
--
which
the
government
reads
the
1938
resolution
would
incorporate
the
word
"only"
into
that
resolution.
in
other
words,
that
a
holiday
allowance
is
payable
only
in
as
one
situation
covered
by
the
1938
resolution,
yet
the
word
"only"
that
it
nowhere
--
does
not
anywhere
appear
in
the
1938
resolution.
in
other
words,
if
congress
actually
intended
to
repeal
that
40
years
practice
of
paying
a
per
diem
employee,
a
holiday
allowance
and
a
holiday
work,
it
could
very
easily
have
done
so
by
expressed
clear
language
yet
such
language
is
utterly
liking
in
--
in
the
1938
resolution
and
even
repeal
or
cause
doesn't
repeal
the
1885
law
in
so
many
words.
i've
mentioned
the
analogies
that
would
--
results
where
the
--
where
the
government's
contentions
followed
here.
one
final
point,
the
government
argues
that
the
1938
resolution
should
be
considered
--
considered
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
in
1943,
the
president
had
said
that
federal
employees
work
on
all
of
the
holidays
except
christmas.
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
see
what
possible
relevance
--
what
the
president
did
in
1943,
five
years
after
the
1938
resolution
was
before
congress,
can
have
in
throwing
light
of
the
--
the
intent
of
congress
was
five
years
earlier.
it
has,
to
my
mind,
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
this
case
which
--
to
which
we're
trying
to
file
what
the
intent
of
congress
was
in
1938.in
the
wartime,
policies
in
1943
or
1945,
in
six
or
seven
years
later,
have
no
relevance
or
give
us
no
help
at
all
on
that
question.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
--
the
wartime
policy
resolution
of
the
president
did
not
say
the
employee
should
not
be
paid
whatever
he
was
actually
should
be
given.
i
merely
said
that
the
holidays
was
to
be
considered
a
working
day.
and
as
stated
by
the
court
below,
if
the
government
required
the
assistance
of
the
per
diem
employees,
it
should
pay
up
the
rate
set
forth
by
the
statutes,
just
as
in
private
industry,
employees
were
paid
premium
pays
or
paid
for
work
on
holidays
even
during
the
wartime.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
none,
for
the
reason
that,
if
you
will
read
it,
it's
based
solely
on
the
assumption
that
the
1938
resolution
operated
to
repeal
the
1885
in
its
entirety.
and
we
say
that
that
subject
construction
simply
cannot
hold
out.
in
other
words,
the
comptroller
general's
interpretation
--
there's
just
one
interpretation
on
it,
it
was
predicated
on
that
assumption
that
the
1885
was
repealed.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
pardon
me?
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
pardon
me?
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
the
practice
was
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
no,
that
is
right,
your
honor.
it
was
not
to
pay
double
under
the
--
under
the
assumption
that
the
1885
act
has
been
entirely
repealed.
thank
you.
