would
you
--
would
you
agree
that
if
the
conclusion
is
reached
that
the
1885
act
was
repealed
in
toto
that
your
claim
involves?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
claim
involved.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
it
all
depends
on
how
you
read
section
2
of
the
1938
act.
justice
john
m.

right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
would
you
go
this
far
that
you
say
that
there
is
possibly
an
ambiguity
and
that
the
statue
can
be
read
as
saying
the
joint
resolution
of
1885
is
repealed
and
all
other
laws
to
the
extent
inconsistent
therewith
are
repealed.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
say
that
that
reading
that
i
suggested
would
have
to
have
a
comma
after
act?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
what
happens
with
respect
to
the
working
on
a
holiday
that's
not
one
of
the
six
holidays
included
after
the
1885
act?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
that
a
fellow

justice
john
m.
harlan
so
that
a
fellow
who
works
on
a
holiday
included
in
the
six
days
covered
by
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
1885
act,
he
gets
double
pay
but
if
he
works
on
another
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
he
doesn't.
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
to
what
--
i
was
thinking
about
was
the
1885
act
had
been
construed,
had
it
not,
to
be
limited
to
the
specific
six
holidays
mentioned
in
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
the
1938
act
comes
along
and
that's
executive
order
holidays
et
cetera.
since
you
have
to
go
--
and
that
is
--
that
is
not
inconsistent,
that
additional
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
an
additional.
now,
therefore
to
get
your
double
pay,
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
1885
act
which
you
say
is
unaffected
by
the
1938
act
in
--
in
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
respect.
