mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
hereon
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
claims.
the
single
issue
presented
is
whether
a
federal
per
diem
employees
and
federal
--
a
per
diem
employee
is
one
whose
rate
of
compensation
is
fixed
on
a
piece-work,
daily
or
hourly
basis,
rather
than
on
an
annual
basis,
are
entitled
to
an
extra
day's
compensation
as
a
gratuity
for
work
on
holidays
during
world
war
ii
which
were
regular
workdays
for
all
federal
employees.
the
background
of
this
litigation
comes
down
to
this,
by
two
presidential
directives
during
1943,
all
normally
observed
peace-time
holidays
with
the
exemption
of
christmas
were
designated
as
regular
workdays
for
the
balance
of
the
war
in
the
interest
of
obtaining
maximum
output
in
governmental
activities.
for
the
duration
of
the
law,
therefore,
all
federal
employees,
per
annum
workers
and
per
diem
workers
alike,
worked
on
these
days
just
as
on
other
days
in
the
work
week.
for
this
work,
per
annum
employees
receive
no
additional
compensation
and
per
diem
employees
receive
their
regular
rate
of
pay.
now,
the
respondent
in
this
case,
mr.
bergh,
was
one
of
these
per
diem
workers,
an
employee
of
the
department
of
the
navy
at
the
shipyard
at
portsmouth,
virginia.
pursuant
to
the
previously
mentioned
directives,
respondent
and
common
with
all
federal
employees
worked
on
new
year's
day,
washington's
birthday,
memorial
day
and
july
4
in
the
year
1945
just
as
on
other
days
in
the
work
week.
for
this
work,
and
we
think
it's
important
to
note
this,
the
respondent
was
paid
his
regular
wages
plus
any
overtime
or
night
differential
that
he
was
entitled
to.
by
this
action,
filed
some
seven
years
after
his
work
was
performed,
the
respondent
seeks
an
additional
day's
pay
as
a
gratuity
for
working
on
these
days
which
we
emphasized
again
were
regular
workdays
for
all
federal
employees.
his
claim
is
that
while
concededly
the
largest
class
of
government
employee,
the
per
annum
worker,
was
not
entitled
to
the
gratuity.
the
class
of
which
he
is
a
representative,
the
per
diem
worker,
is
entitled
to
this
gratuity
which
the
general
accounting
office
estimates
will
aggregate
somewhere
perhaps
in
the
neighborhood
of
$750
million.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
over
the
period
of
the
war.
they
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
correct.
they
do
not
know,
of
course,
because
claims
of
all
have
not
been
filed
but
they're
upwards
at
70,000
claims
at
this
point.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
your
honor,
the
congress
--
there's
a
bill
pending
in
congress
which
will,
should
this
court
affirm
this
judgment,
suspend
the
statute
of
limitations
or
waive
it
and
give
this
individual
the
opportunity
to
file
in
the
court
of
claims.
now,
this
bill
was
not
intended
to
connote
any
view
of
congress
on
the
merits
but
--
so
that
there
is
still
--
potentially
it
is
rather
large
liability.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
it's
being
held
in
advance,
if
your
honor
pleases.
now,
at
the
outset
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right
because
the
respondent
in
this
case
was
in
the
service
from
1946
to
1948
and
under
the
soldiers
and
sailors
civil
relief
act,
the
limitation
period
did
not
run
while
he
was
in
service.
there's
no
question
about
this
suit
being
tardy.
now,
at
the
very
outset,
we
think
it's
important
to
note
that
the
payment
of
a
gratuity,
and
that's
what
this
is,
this
claim,
to
a
federal
employee
must
have
its
roots
in
a
federal
statute
which
either
expressly
provides
for
the
gratuity
in
the
particular
circumstances
or
in
the
alternative
confers
permissive
discretion
upon
the
employing
agency
to
pay
the
gratuity.
now,
here,
we
can,
at
the
very
outset,
lay
aside
the
matter
of
permissive
discretion.
it
may
be
that
under
the
act
of
july
16,
1862,
set
forth
in
the
government's
brief
at
page
3,
conferring
authority
upon
the
secretary
of
the
navy
to
promulgate
rates
of
wages,
it
may
be
that
under
that
act,
the
secretary
of
the
navy
had
the
discretion
to
award
gratuity
pay
to
these
employees
for
working
on
these
days
which
at
the
time
were
normal
wok
days.
but
the
plain
fact
is
that
if
he
had
that
discretion,
he
did
not
exercise
it.
this
respondent's
employment
was
governed
by
a
schedule
of
wages.
the
schedule
of
wages
is
explicit
on
the
matter
of
its
compensation
for
holiday
work.
it
provides
that
for
that
work,
he
is
to
receive
his
regular
rate
of
pay,
plus
of
course
overtime
or
night
differential
allowances.
the
schedule
of
wages
provides
that
he
is
to
get
gratuity
pay
only
if
he
is
unable
to
work
on
the
particular
holiday,
relieved
or
prevented
from
working
on
the
holiday
and
thus
cannot
earn
his
normal
day's
pay.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
it
says
that
he
can't
get
it
then
but
it
says
that
with
respect
to
the
days
upon
which
he
--
he
works,
he
is
to
be
allowed
his
regular
pay
plus
a
premium
of
50%
if
the
holiday
falls
without
his
normal
work
week.
now,
these
holidays
fell
within
this
employee's
normal
work
week.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
--
that's
right
but
the
--
but
the
--
the
schedule
of
wages
did
not
specifically
authorize
this
and
the
respondent
has
not
contended
at
any
point
in
this
case
that
the
schedule
of
wages
here
conferred
an
entitlement
upon
the
respondent
to
this
gratuity
for
holiday
work.
so
that
the
question
comes
down
to
whether
in
1943
--
or
in
1945
rather,
there
was
a
mandatory
statutory
requirement
that
per
diem
employees
were
to
be
given
a
gratuity
above
and
beyond
their
normal
compensation
for
working
on
days
which
were
for
all
federal
employees
regular
workdays
as
to
this
matter
that
we
now
turn.
the
history
of
legislation
on
the
subject
of
holiday
gratuity
pay
for
per
diem
workers
goes
back
to
1880.
prior
to
that
time,
the
per
diem
worker
was
not
paid
on
days
in
which
no
work
was
performed.
as
a
consequence,
when
a
holiday
intervened
and
the
employee
was
prevented
from
work,
his
paycheck
was
reduced
accordingly.
this
was
not
so
to
the
per
annum
worker,
his
salary
has
traditionally
been
regarded
as
payment
for
everyday
of
the
year
whether
a
workday
or
not.
consequently,
when
he
was
excused
from
work,
this
had
no
effect
at
all
upon
his
paycheck.he
received
the
same
amount.
now,
by
a
resolution
of
1880,
limited
in
its
application
to
the
government
printing
office
and
the
resolution
of
january
6,
1885,
which
had
general
applicability
to
per
diem
employees,
congress
had
vested
itself
to
this
situation.
it
allowed,
by
these
resolutions,
certain
specified
days
as
holidays
with
the
same
pay
as
on
other
days.
and
as
the
legislative
history
of
these
resolutions
show,
which
is
set
forth
in
18
and
19
of
the
government's
brief,
the
single
purpose
of
these
resolutions
was
to
equate
the
position
of
the
per
diem
and
per
annum
worker
that,
henceforth,
the
occurrence
of
a
holiday
with
non-occasional
reduction
in
the
per
diem
workers
paycheck
anymore
than
did
in
the
per
annum
worker's
paycheck.
now,
despite
the
fact
that
this
was
the
sole
purpose
of
this
resolution
insofar
as
the
legislative
history
reflects,
the
1885
resolution
was
administratively
interpreted
by
the
comptroller
of
the
of
the
treasury
and
then
by
the
comptroller
general
as
meaning
that
when
the
per
diem
worker
worked
on
the
holiday
and
thus
was
able
to
obtain
his
regular
wages,
he
nevertheless
was
entitled
to
this
gratuity.
in
short,
under
this
interpretation,
the
per
diem
employee
was
placed
in
this
preferential
position,
the
per
annum
worker
worked
in
the
holiday,
no
additional
compensation,
the
per
diem
worker
worked
on
the
holiday,
he
got
his
regular
wages,
he
got
his
gratuity
as
well.
now,
this
situation,
which
as
i
say,
resulted
from
his
interpretation
of
the
accounting
officials
of
the
government
lasted
until
the
1930s.
on
december
7,
1937,
the
president
issued
an
executive
order
closing
down
the
government
establishment
from
the
day
before
christmas,
december
24th,
and
excusing
all
employees
from
work.
now,
this
executive
order
had
no
effect
at
all
upon
the
per
annum
worker
unless
he's
paid.but
december
24th
wasn't
one
of
the
days
specified
in
the
1885
resolution.
accordingly,
the
per
diem
worker
was
excused
from
work
and
couldn't
work
because
his
establishment
was
closed,
received
no
additional
compensation,
received
no
compensation,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
at
all.
accordingly,
a
resolution
was
introduced
into
the
house
of
representatives
which
would
have
had
the
effect
of
allowing
compensation
to
those
per
diem
workers
by
way
of
a
gratuity,
to
those
per
diem
workers
who
had
been
--
who
had
lost
wages
by
the
result
of
this
executive
order,
in
other
words,
who
hadn't
worked
on
december
24th.
there
was
nothing
in
this
resolution
to
the
effect
that
if
the
per
diem
worker
had
worked
on
december
24th
and
thus
had
been
able
to
obtain
his
regular
wages,
he
was
to
get
additional
day's
pay
as
a
gratuity.
now,
this
resolution
was
referred
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
you
mean
the
gratuity
pay.
that's
right,
that
he
would
not
have
obtained
the
--
the
gratuity
pay.
now,
this
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right.
that's
why
this
resolution
was
necessary.
it
was
that
december
24th
was
not
one
of
the
days
specified
in
the
1885
resolution.
so
that
when
the
employee
didn't
work
on
december
24th,
he
couldn't
obtain
his
regular
wages
and
he
couldn't
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
there
was
--
there
was
special
--
the
customary
holidays,
your
honor,
it
was
new
years
day,
washington's
birthday,
memorial
day,
independence
day,
i
think
that
labor
day
was
added
and
may
even
the
armistice
day,
and
christmas.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
not
by
the
executive
at
this
point.
these
were
just
certain
specified
days
designated
in
particular
legislation
which
is
why
this
probably
came
up
with
respect
to
december
24th.
now,
this
resolution
was
referred
to
the
house
committee
on
the
civil
service
which
was
advised
by
the
civil
service
commission
that
the
problem
of
holiday
pay
for
per
diem
workers
raised
broader
issues
which
should
be
resolved
by
general
legislation
rather
than
on
a
piecemeal
basis
and
attached
to
the
committee
report
was
a
detailed
decision
of
the
comptroller
general
comparing
the
effect
of
holidays
upon
the
per
diem
and
per
annum
worker.
and
this
decision
set
forth
the
various
preferences
and
discriminations
which
had
resulted
as
a
result
of
the
administrative
interpretation
of
the
1885
resolution.
and
one
of
those,
which
was
specifically
referred
to,
was
the
matter
of
the
per
diem
employee
under
this
administrative
construction
obtaining
double
pay
if
he
worked
on
the
holiday
while
the
per
annum
worker
did
not
receive
additional
compensation.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
--
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
reference
was
broader
than
that.
i
think
that
the
comptroller
reference
was
to
the
--
the
broad
problem
of
the
per
diem
worker
obtaining
this
double
compensation
if
he
worked
on
the
holiday
while
the
per
annum
worker
did
not.
that's
the
way
at
any
rate
that
we
read
the
committee
report.
now
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right
and
that's
been
true,
mr.
justice
douglas,
of
the
per
annum
worker
--
well,
it's
true
up
to
1945.
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
we
think
that
in
this
area,
they
can,
your
honor,
be
more
or
less
acquainted.
we
do
not
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
this,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
whether
it's
a
rational
basis
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
--
it
certainly
is
a
historical
basis.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
really
don't
know.
as
i
say
it's
--
it's
something
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
--
it's
had
a
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
per
diem
worker
has
safeguards
against
discharge
in
the
same
manner
in
which
a
per
annum
worker
has
safeguards.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
is
the
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
is
the
per
diem
worker
in
the
government
comparable
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
roughly
speaking,
yes.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
per
diem
worker
in
the
government
--
there
is
on
page
34
of
the
record
a
comparison
of
the
conditions
of
employment
of
mr.
bergh
and
his
private
counterpart
or
private
industry
at
the
time.
and
if
the
court
will
turn
to
that,
it
will
note
that
the
conditions
of
mr.
bergh's
employment
and
they
compared
very
favorably
indeed
with
those
of
his
private
counterpart,
he
got
26
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
between
the
annual
worker
and
the
per
diem
worker?
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
i
think
that
they're
again
on
--
on
balance,
the
per
diem
worker
has
done
very
well
indeed.
the
per
diem
worker's
salary
after
all
is
computed
on
the
basis
to
what
his
counterpart
in
private
industry
obtains.
now,
i
think
that
this
court
can
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
as
i
say,
this
has
a
historical
basis.
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
why
it
was
determined
in
one
point.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
in
--
in
connection
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
in
connection
with
the
matter
of
holiday
pay,
we
submit
that
you
can
go
right
back
to
this
1880
legislation.
it
all
--
it
carried
all
the
way
through
to
the
present
time.
and
there's
no
indication
that
congress
in
this
area
intended
to
treat
the
per
diem
worker
and
the
per
annum
worker
in
a
different
fashion.
now,
the
1938
resolution
which
grew
out
at
this
initial
resolution,
specifically
provides
that
whenever
an
employee
is
relieved
or
prevented
from
working
on
a
holiday,
either
one
which
it
declared
by
statued
or
one
provided
for
an
executive
order,
he
is
to
receive
the
same
pay
as
on
other
day.
and
after
this
resolution
was
in
enacted,
1938,
the
comptroller
general,
same
official
who's
administrative
interpretation
of
the
1885
resolution
is
all
that
this
respondent
has
as
a
basis
for
his
claim.
the
comptroller
general
rule
on
no
less
than
four
occasions
that
the
effect
of
1938
resolution
was
to
supersede
the
administrative
practice
that
the
1938
resolution
by
its
provision
to
section
1
which
i've
just
related
and
the
provisions
of
section
2
which
repealed
the
1885
resolution
and
all
other
inconsistent
or
conflicting
laws
--
to
the
extent
of
the
inconsistency
or
conflict
that
the
1938
resolution
eliminated
this
practice
which
he
had
been
following
by
reason
of
his
reading
of
the
1885
resolution.
now,
between
1938,
when
the
comptroller
general
made
this
determination,
and
1943,
at
least,
the
comptroller
general's
interpretation
of
1938
resolution
was
accepted
generally.
this
is
shown
by
among
other
things
to
follow.several
bills
were
introduced
in
the
subsequent
congresses
which
would
have
had
the
effect
of
restoring
the
old
practice.
these
bills
provided
that
the
employee
who
worked
on
the
holiday
was
to
obtain
double
compensation.
in
a
committee
consideration
of
these
bills,
it
was
a
--
specifically
directed
to
the
committee's
attention
that
the
comptroller
general
had
interpreted
the
1938
resolution.
as
requiring
gratuity
pay,
only
worthy
employee
was
relieved
or
prevented
from
working
and
thus
couldn't
draw
his
normal
wages.
the
bureau
of
the
budget,
the
very
organization
which
had
drafted
the
1938
resolution
and
by
the
congress
that
it
was
not
in
sympathy
with
the
aims
of
the
subsequent
bills
to
--
which
would
have
restored
this
practice,
that
in
the
words
of
the
bureau
of
the
budget,
double
compensation
for
holiday
work
was
not
consistent
with
the
program
of
the
president.
now,
not
one
of
these
bills
even
got
out
of
the
committee.
second,
the
1940
edition
of
the
u.s.
code
prepared
under
the
direction
of
the
house
committee
on
revision
of
the
laws
expressly
reflects
the
view
of
the
codifiers
that
the
1938
resolution
repealed
the
1885
resolution
at
least
to
the
extent
that
--
that
earlier
resolution
required
double
compensation
for
work
performed
on
holidays.
it
wasn't
until
1943,
at
least,
and
maybe
later,
that
this
problem,
this
claim,
the
double
compensation
for
holiday
work
arose,
and
then,
of
course,
only
because
of
this
presidential
directives
declaring
these
days
regular
working
days
for
all
federal
employees.
and
we
must
stress
again
that
what
the
respondent
has
here
is
no
more
than
this
administrative
interpretation
of
the
1885
resolution
by
the
comptroller
general
and
in
placing
total
alliance
upon
that
administrative
interpretation,
he,
at
the
same
time,
says
that
the
interpretation
of
the
comptroller
general
of
the
1938
resolution
has
eliminated
this
administrative
practice
is
all
wrong.
and
we
can't
pay
any
attention
to
it,
whatsoever,
and
solely
that
the
same
interpretation
which
was
given
by
the
codifiers
of
the
u.s.
code,
we
can't
give
any
attention
to
that
either.
the
only
thing
that
we
can
look
to
is
this
administrative
construction
of
this
earlier
resolution.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
in
the
kelly
case,
your
honor,
that
--
that
is
true.
in
the
kelly
case,
the
--
of
course,
the
issue
was
this
as
decided
by
this
court.
the
court
decided
that
the
contract
between
the
public
printer
and
the
--
these
employees
in
the
--
in
the
government
printing
office,
required
--
by
contract,
required
double
compensation
for
holiday
work.
this
court
did
not
decide
and
especially
reserve
judgment
on
the
question
as
to
whether
there
was
a
mandatory
statutory
requirement
in
the
absence
of
contract.
now,
of
course,
it
is
the
government
printing
office
employees
by
this
court's
decision
between
2500
roughly
were
entitled
as
a
matter
of
contract
to
--
to
this
double
compensation.
but
that
is
all.
it
has
rested
exclusively
on
the
basis
of
the
contract
that
was
entered
into
--
between
the
government
printing
office,
and
public
printer,
and
the
employees
of
the
--
the
unions
that
represented
those
employees.
now,
if
the
court
pleases,
if
the
time
does
not
permit
me
to
go
into
in
detail
the
considerations
which
motivated
the
court
of
claims
to
accept
this
position.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
we
think
it
has
just
this
play,
your
honor.
there
is
no
question
that
if
there
is
a
clear
statutory
requirement
that
these
employees
obtain
double
play
for
this
work,
they
are
entitled
to
it
even
though
these
days
were
designated
as
regular
workdays.
so,
we
think
that
in
this
circumstances
where
--
because
of
the
war
all
of
these
days
were
made
regular
workdays
in
which
all
employees
worked
and
which
the
per
annum
worker
concededly
is
entitled
to
no
additional
compensation
for
doing
so
that
there
must
be
a
very
clear
statutory
requirement
before
this
class
of
workers
for
working
on
these
regular
workdays
gets
an
additional
compensation
as
a
gratuity,
not
as
compensation
for
work
performed,
but
as
a
gratuity
which
may
amount
to
some
--
some
$150
million.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
the
--
the
excerpts
and
the
directives,
i
think,
are
set
forth,
if
your
honor
pleases,
in
our
brief
at
pages
4
and
5.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
may
it
please
the
court.
first
of
all,
with
respect
to
the
manner
of
the
legislative
history
and
it's
bearing
upon
whether
congress
intended
to
repeal
in
its
entirety
the
1885
resolution,
it's
interesting
to
note
that
immediately
following
the
text
of
the
resolution
in
the
legislative
history
in
the
committee
report,
it
has
stated
that
section
2
proposes
to
repeal
the
joint
resolution
of
1885,
not
in
part
just
opposes
to
repeal.
now,
with
respect
to
the
terms
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
the
--
the
sentences
that
section
2
proposes
and
it's
explanatory
in
section
2
that
it
proposes
to
repeal
the
joint
resolution
of
january
6,
1885.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
pardon?
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
it's
--
i
think
--
yes,
your
honor,
just
had
the
--
then
the
only
thing
that
was
after
that
was
the
identification
by
u.s.
code
section.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
--
i
think
there
was
no
reference
if
i
recall
correctly.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that
was
just
the
reference
--
it
was
the
citation
of
the
--
the
joint
resolution
of
1885.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
we
think,
your
honor,
in
this
area
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
your
honor,
we
think
that
it
is
descriptive
of
section
2.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
because
we
think
that
the
congress
intended
to
bar
section
2
to
its
references
to
the
--
to
the
extent
of
such
conflict
or
inconsistency
actually
related
to
all
other
laws
inconsistency
--
inconsistent
or
in
conflict.
now,
certainly,
there
is
at
least
an
inconsistency
between
these
two
statutes.
the
1885
resolution,
as
interpreted
administratively,
required
double
compensation
that
the
employee
worked
on
a
holiday.
the
1938
resolution,
in
terms,
requires
gratuity
pay,
only
if
the
employee
is
relieved
or
prevented
from
working
on
the
holiday.
now,
with
respect
to
the
--
the
matter
of
the
kelly
case,
we
see
absolutely
no
inconsistency
between
our
position
here
and
the
course
holding
in
kelly.
we
have
never
suggested
that
the
1938
resolution
constituted
an
absolute
bar
against
contracts
providing
for
gratuity
pay.
indeed,
at
the
very
outset
of
my
argument,
i
attempted
to
make
it
clear
that
our
position
is,
that
there
must
be
either
a
statute
creating
a
permissive
discretion
upon
the
agency
which
there
was
in
the
--
in
the
kelly
case.
it
was
the
statute
of
1924
which
gave
authority
to
the
public
printer
to
enter
into
these
contracts,
or
else,
there
must
be
a
statute
which
actually
requires
it.
now,
in
this
case,
there's
no
aspect
to
permissive
discretion
at
all,
but
this
claim
is
based
upon
as
a
must-be
upon
our
being
a
statute
granting
absolute
entitlement
to
it.
now,
we
again
call
this
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
after
the
1938
resolution
was
enacted,
it
was
uniformly
construed
until
this
wartime
situation
arose
as
eliminating
this
practice.
it
was
construed
by
the
same
official,
the
comptroller
general,
who
had
set
out
this
administrative
practice
which
forms
the
sole
basis
for
the
respondents'
claim.
now,
with
respect
to
the
absurdity
of
paying
a
man
the
same
amount
whether
he
works
or
whether
he
doesn't
work,
as
was
pointed
out
by
the
court,
this
is
a
situation
as
pertained
with
the
per
annum
worker
and
until
1945
congress
did
not
see
that
to
make
any
change.
additionally,
all
of
these
special
statutes,
which
was
set
forth
in
our
brief,
which
related
to
a
date
not
included
in
the
1885
resolution,
these
were
statutes
which
were
enacted
before
1938,
each
of
them
provided
in
terms
that
the
employee
who
was
relieved
from
working
was
to
get
gratuity
pay.
none
of
them
applied
to
the
employee
who
had
worked
on
that
specific
day.
so,
there,
the
congress
itself,
apparently
recognized
the
--
that
there
was
no
inherent
absurdity
in
paying
a
man
the
same
amount
whether
he
worked
or
whether
he
doesn't
--
he
didn't.
now,
since
--
of
course,
1945,
both
per
annum
and
the
--
the
per
diem
worker
obtained
additional
compensation
for
holidays.
but
if
you
will
trace
the
--
this
legislation,
in
its
subject
of
holiday
pay
from
its
very
beginning
to
carry
it
through
to
today,
there
has
--
there
isn't
a
shred
of
evidence
in
any
of
the
legislative
history
or
in
the
terms
of
these
bills
to
indicate
that
congress
intended
to
create
this
preference
for
the
per
diem
worker,
the
preference
arose
by
virtue
of
this
administrative
construction
of
the
1885
resolution.
the
congress
in
1938
has
its
attention
called
to
that
resolution
and
to
these
preferences
and
discriminations
that
arose
thereunder.
and
then,
they
came
forth
with
this
1938
resolution
which
provides
that
gratuity
pay
when
the
employee
is
relieved
or
prevented
from
working
on
that
day.
and
then
in
section
2
they
say
to
the
extent,
inconsistent
or
in
conflict,
the
1885
resolution
rather
and
all
other
resolutions
are
hereby
repealed.
and
we
think
that
the
--
if
the
court
pleases,
that
for
these
reasons
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no
there
was
a
--
there's
a
contract
of
--
the
government
in
the
kelly
case
took
the
--
did
not
contest
that
the
act
of
1924
which
is
in,
i
think,
44
u.s.c.
40,
that's
the
statute
relating
to
the
setting
of
wages
for
employees
of
the
government
printing
office
that
that
statute
conferred
upon
the
public
printer,
the
authority,
if
he
felt
it
necessary.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
the
navy,
of
course,
has
a
similar
statute,
the
act
of
1862.
now,
the
secretary
of
the
navy,
in
setting
forth
the
terms
and
conditions
of
this
response
employment
did
not
see
fit
to
make
provisions
in
the
exercise
of
his
discretion
for
gratuity
pay.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right,
but
that's
quite
true.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no.
well,
the
resolution
(voice
overlap)
--
it's
the
--
yes,
the
resolution
isn't
a
--
a
prohibition.
it's
just
that
the
resolution
moved
the
requirement
of
paying
this
double
pay.
now,
very
few
agencies
have
seen
the
necessity
and
again
if
you
compare
the
terms
of
this
respondent's
employment
with
those
of
his
private
counterparts,
you'll
find
that
in
the
absence
of
this
gratuity
pay,
that
pay
compares
very
favorably
and
of
course
that's
the
object
of
the
--
the
department
of
the
navy
to
see
what
that
--
there
was
a
moral
--
like
rough
equivalent
between
the
pay
of
these
employees,
per
diem
employees
and
those
--
the
pay
of
his
private
counterparts.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
pardon?
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
the
report
number,
your
honor?
it's
report
number
2683
in
the
75th
congress,
third
session.
and
it's
cited
in
the
government's
brief.
