that
phrase
in
the
first
one,
when
they
were
talking
about
the
nonworking
day
and
you
said
that
he
was
to
get
--
you'll
get
single
pay
ordinarily
for
the
--
for
the
holiday
but
in
nonworking
day,
he
will
get
double
pay?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
--
did
the
--
did
the
government
make
this
argument
in
the
kelly
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
the
resolution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
thatcher,
give
me
a
concrete
illustration,
if
you
will,
according
to
your
contention,
what
does
an
employee
get
if
he
works
on
one
of
these
holidays.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
these
holidays
should
include?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
double
pay.
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
right.
now,
suppose
he
doesn't
work
but
he
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
suppose
he
has
a
contract
like
they
had
in
kelly
case,
what
does
he
get?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that
was
a
time
and
a
half
for
holidays.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
he
get
double
pay
and
--
and
a
half
pay
in
addition
to
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
justice
brennan
said
he
got
250%.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
the
statute
governs
as
to
without
a
--
with
a
contract,
why
shouldn't
it
be
governed
without
a
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
kelly
case
then
did
recognize
the
gratuity
at
least
by
contract.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
the
1938
act
had
been
intended
to
do
away
with
gratuity
as
with
this
kelly
case
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
court
will
object
to
decline
the
whole
that
the
1938
amendment
had
that
question,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
although
the
two
of
us
don't
care.
justice
hugo
l.
black
three.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
in
doing
so,
they
left
--
they
--
they
left
in
effect
a
gratuity,
thereby
a
policy
--
i
don't'
know,
thereby
a
policy
indicating
that
they
rejected
the
idea
that
the
1938
act
made
gratuities
illegal.
