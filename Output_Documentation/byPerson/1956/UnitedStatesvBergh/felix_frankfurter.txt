justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
he
would
not
have
been
included
in
the
practice
established
--
in
the
--
he
would
not
have
been
included
in
the
--
in
the
administrative
construction
placed
by
the
comptroller,
the
comptroller
general
giving
him
overtime
when
he
did
work.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
because
--
is
that
because
the
days
were
enumerated
in
some
general
principles?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
included?
what
dates
were
included?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
--
did
they
represent
a
tribe
or
they
--
were
they
picked
on
a
special
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
--
the
holidays
or
nonworking
days
designated
by
--
by
the
congress
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
also
include
nonworking
day
so
designated
by
the
executive?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
constantly,
acquaint
those
two,
can
one
acquaint
those
two?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
like
telling
me
what
--
is
there
any
rational
difference,
is
there
any
rational
basis
on
which
people
are
per
diem
workers
rather
per
annum
worker?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
what
is
it?
i'm
not
talking
about
this
point,
i
want
to
know
what
general
consideration
can
be
governed,
employee
in
the
executive
being
made
by
the
day
rather
than
having
an
annual
acquaint
of
salary
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
per
diem
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
per
diem
worker,
as
this
worker
can
be
laid
off
easily.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
discharge.
i
mean
which
as
a
--
you
don't
need
so
many
workers.
if
the
per
diem
worker
in
the
government
comparable
at
all
in
the
conditions
of
employment
to
the
per
diem
worker
in
a
private
industry?
justice
felix
frankfurter
probably
speaking,
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
theirs
must
be
not
between
him
but
between
the
annual
workers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
don't
like
on
why
--
why
some
employees
of
the
government
have
per
diem
rather
than
on
a
fixed
wage.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
two
categories
of
worker,
what
i
wonder
if
they
have
any
case
that
would
shed
some
light,
whether
that's
some
general
appeal
case
based
under
that
or
call
--
call
it
what
you
will
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
bear
on
this
specific
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
have
to
go
--
why
do
you
have
to
go
to
legislative
history
to
--
to
read
that
statute
in
the
same
manner.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
about
--
don't
know
what
the
--
whether
there
is
or
isn't
but
the
repeal
is
restricted
if
the
questions
got
caught
up
with
your
answer,
but
if
you
restrict
it
to
the
extent
of
such
inconsistency
or
conflict
and
therefore
i
have
to
practically
consider
that
there
is
no
inconsistency
or
conflict
(inaudible)
1885
extent
and
you
say
not
on
the
extent
of
work
but
of
the
administrative
--
of
the
administrative
allowance
could
apply.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
must
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
go
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
the
--
has
the
--
if
all
other
laws
inconsistent,
is
that
just
a
large
reservation
or
are
there
specific
clause
--
are
there
specific
clause
who
could
be
in
conflict
with
the
two,
either
the
government
--
either
the
government
or
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
this
is
one
of
the
army
entitled
clauses.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
legislative
history
about,
which
i
was
skeptical
a
minute
ago,
now
i'm
curious,
would
that
shed
any
light
whether
the
first
clause
said
--
suggested
to
the
construction
of
justice
harlan
that
any
light
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
they
meant
by
the
first
clause
of
the
joint
resolution
of
january
6,
1885
is
repealed
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
kelly
case,
it's
--
there's
been
no
contract,
he
would
have
said
he
got
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
was
against
the
answer
you
gave
to
justice
black.
now,
on
constant
that
the
government
can't
do
by
contract
or
as
congress
says
it
can't
be
done
by
its
own
authority.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
all
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
can
say
is
--
all
you
can
say
--
can
you
say
more
than
that
if
1938
meant
to
cutout
gratuity
allowances,
it
would
be
behind
of
such
a
public
policy
that
this
court
wouldn't
have
construed
the
contract
better
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
go
beyond
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
three.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
judge
whittaker
did
--
did
an
imaginative
thing
in
suggesting
that
he
dissents
on
the
--
on
the
kelly
case,
that
seems
to
me
to
be
an
interesting
mode
of
reasoning.
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
what
is
the
--
is
that
part
of
a
sentence
or
something?
justice
felix
frankfurter
period.
justice
felix
frankfurter
period
after
that
that
you've
just
said?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
says
nothing
about
your
--
the
other
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
can't
be
an
act
--
like
a
statement
to
what
your
inspection
suggests.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
if
it
makes
--
if
it
makes
no
--
i
mean,
to
believe
that
that
is
not
the
descriptive
of
section
2,
what
you've
read,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
leaves
out
the
second
half
of
it
authentically.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
under
kelly
case
here
is
an
explicit
statutory
authorization
to
make
such
an
agreement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
isn't
there
a
similar
statute
right
in
every
executive
ordinance?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
even
when
you
haven't
got
any
--
that
kind
of
a
little
statue
practically
every
executive
agency
of
the
government
as
by
practice
follow
the
fixed
--
fixed
rate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
that's
true
--
if
that
is
true,
then,
it
is
open
to
every
executive
press
to
get
from
under
the
act
the
resolution
of
1938
by
what
we
call
"contract."
