justice
harold
burton
does
it
say
that
he
can't
get
it
then
or
that
he
can
get
the
standard?
justice
harold
burton
(inaudible)
justice
harold
burton
that
was
the
--
it's
on
the
nonworking
day?
justice
harold
burton
as
i
understand
that
you
--
you
claimed
the
1938
is
partially
inconsistent
with
the
1885?
it's
inconsistent
--
justice
harold
burton
--
on
two
specific
points
and
not
on
the
risk?
justice
harold
burton
and
the
one
at
issue
is
one
of
the
risk?
justice
harold
burton
well,
--
justice
harold
burton
the
--
the
clause
certainly
says
without
punctuation,
all
other
laws
is
inconsistent
and
therefore
the
other
laws
must
--
must
have
any
other
of
the
1885
law
as
being
also
in
the
same
classification.
justice
harold
burton
and
that's
one
or
the
other.
justice
harold
burton
yes.
justice
harold
burton
and
in
that
particular,
deliberately
cutout
a
benefit
for
the
per
diem.
justice
harold
burton
that
was
inconsistent.
justice
harold
burton
and
that
was
inconsistent
with
the
previous
--
justice
harold
burton
by
the
agreement.
justice
harold
burton
well,
under
the
government's
theory
is
--
is
this
your
understanding
of
it,
that
a
per
diem
worker
who
has
a
holiday
and
he's
not
called
to
work,
he
gets
his
gratuity.
and
then
if
he
is
called
to
work,
he
doesn't
get
any
extra
at
all,
he
just
works.
justice
harold
burton
and
the
man
who
stays
home
who
would
--
who
was
not
called
out,
he
gets
the
same
amount
of
pay
but
doesn't
work.
