justice
felix
frankfurter
and
this
is
how
i
understand
it.
i'm
not
to
infer
from
what
you
just
said
that
if
there
is
jurisdiction
otherwise
in
a
three-judge
court,
that
the
scope
of
executive
powers
is
any
less
than
that
of
a
single
equity
judge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
it
has
to
--
has
to
have
jurisdiction
as
defined
by
that
here,
the
urgent
deficiencies
act.
but
they
form
--
they
formed
--
since
yes,
it
does
then
it
can
regulate
the
conformity
and
it
--
its
powers
would
be
clear,
no
different
than
a
single
judgment
passed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
thus
brought
in.
i
--i
assume
you
will
tell
us
what
it
said
and
in
what
way
allegheny
to
relation
to
those
two
to
be
combined
entities
was
effected.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
automatically
that
would
change
the
relationship?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
affect
--
did
it
affect
the
interest
of
allegheny?
did
it
affect
the
interest
of
its
stockholdings?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
controlling
different
opinions
of
this
thereafter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
implied
what
we
what
would
allegheny
could
before
the
i.c.c.uphold
this
merging.
is
that
it?
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
could.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
this
--
if
they
have
an
interest
in
--
i
can
understand
the
argument
that
it
was
involved
in
the
merger
if
it
could
adversely
be
affected
by
--
or
if
for
any
reason
but
(inaudible)
it
would
mean
such
a
merger
undesirable
of.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
am
i
right
and
in
the
assumption
of
my
question
that
allegheny
must
have
some
interest
in
that
for
which
consent
by
the
commission
was
asked
and
in
order
to
make
it
--
in
order
to
bring
it
within.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
it's
controlled,
if
--
if
that
which
the
proceeding
before
the
commission
on
the
merger
leave
allegheny
a
wholly
uninterested
party
and
i
would
have
some
difficulty
to
saying
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
reference
that
allegheny
entered
the
bridge
order
by
the
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
find
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
difficulty
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
he
did
it
in
the
argument
that
he
took
it
through
there
in
explicit
formula,
having
control
over
the
allegation
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
gathered
from
--
it's
because
they
left
out
of
the
second
order
of
what
they
explicitly
have
said
in
the
boston
&
albany.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
--
why
is
that
problem
relevant
to
a
property
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
is
that
based
on
the
--
is
that
a
latitude
in
area
that
is
not
a
broad
meaning
attributed
to
control?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
that
and
it's
properly
broad.
what
i
mean
is,
does
the
commission
rest
on
what
was
partly
involved
in
the
marshall
case
namely,
the
breadth
given
to
the
concept
(inaudible)
as
the
legislative
history
shows
that
this
court
held
any
difference
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
control
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
then
you
don't
acquire
it,
and
if
there
is
control
then
you
do
acquire
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
question
of
--
of
--
what
if
there
is
a
change
that
amounts
to
that
which
it,
maybe
attributed
to
the
concept,
control
and
it
set
it
in
this
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
that
because
you
have
control
and
power,
subsidiaries
one,
two,
three
isn't
the
same
controls
as
a
matter
of
actuality
that
you
may
have
is
there
--
you
have
to
control
one
arriving
out
of
the
absorption
of
two
and
three.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
use
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
more
direct
control.
i
would
say
the
--
the
interest
of
alleghany
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
and
to
use
the
words
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter
early
in
the
argument,
the
proprietary
interest
of
alleghany
were
not
affected
by
that.
what
--
what
is
affected
then,
what
is
brought
into
play,
we
think,
is
the
public
interest,
the
regulatory
interest
in
--
in
keeping
control
of
--
of
this
whole
process
of
carrier
unification
consolidation.
now,
the
district
court
also
held,
although
we
agree
unnecessarily.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
--
are
you
implying
that
it's
for
the
commission
to
determine
whether
such
a
--
such
a
practical
change
in
control
is
affected
and
that
the
commission
has
so
determined?
is
that
implicit
in
your
argument?
the
question
of
control
is
not
a
legal,
inherent,
illegal
practice
by
the
--
the
--
of
the
transportation
problem
and
a
judgment
on
the
effect
on
the
public
of
--
of
the
rearrangement,
is
that
(inaudible)
to
your
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
such
mergers
must
have
the
--
the
approval
of
the
commission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
that
they
must,
but
in
this
case
they
do
as
that
involved.
in
other
words,
maybe
commission
said,
have
said
in
this
case,
“we
don't
think
this
is
a
slight
--
affects
the
control
that
alleghany
had
over
these
constituent
units”
and
therefore,
we
dismissed
alleghany
for
this
proceeding.
could
the
commission
have
done
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is,
it
doesn't
make
a
particular
determination
in
each
case,
but
it
may
have
said
in
generality
that
a
holding
company
of
two
or
more
that
that
the
--
the
rearrangement,
in
general
the
arrangement
of
constituent
company
so
normally
affects
the
relationship
with
the
parent
company
that
--
in
--
in
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
this
--
is
your
argument
directed
to
what
you
deemed
the
inequities
of
the
particular
decree?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
want
to
take
you
time,
but
i
just
want
to
clear
what
your
point
is.
suppose
that
so-called
the
non-stock
holder
intervenes
before
the
i.c.c.
in
this
case
and
since
you
have
no
jurisdiction
over
this
stock
issue
that
belongs
to
the
sec
and
the
i.c.c.
overrules
it
and
does
what
it
did
here.
is
there
no
more
than
reviewing
that
claim
of
none
jurisdiction
by
the
i.c.c?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is,
you
have
to
face
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
doesn't
mean
to
say
you're
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
will
always
protest
in
making
inference.
he's
protested
it
to
the
allegations
said,
"i
want
to
get
such
safe
cars,
presumably,
preferably
safe
cars
under
the
investment
statute.”
such
as
leads
to
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
couldn't
give
up,
but
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
the
whole
point,
mr.
levin,
that
these
protesting
stockholders
say
that
you're
not
under
the
i.c.c.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
--
do
you
say
that
not
only
would
be
constitutionally
congress
say,
“there
shall
be
no
reviewing
power
in
two
agencies
have
more
or
less
having
some
--
in
some
ways
seeming,
overlapping
jurisdiction.”
not
only
that
congress
couldn't
withdraw
a
judicial
review,
as
i
for
one
should
think
it
could
but
in
fact
it
did
say
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
i
would
but
you
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
can
understand.
i
see
addition,
and
to
my
mind
there's
a
difference.
it
didn't
say
where
they
do
it
10
years
from
now.
i
could
--
i
can
understand
objections
on
the
ground
would
execute
the
technical
sense
of
the
equity
of
a
chance
it
but
doing
things
or
not
doing
things.
but
the
question
of
power
is
a
different
one.
so
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
levin,
if
you're
dealing
with
the
decree,
would
you
mind
--
that
this
an
unfair
question
to
ask
you,
but
the
government
didn't
represent
it
here.
would
you
mind
stating
what
you
believe
to
be
the
practical
result
of
the
suggestions
of
the
solicitor
general
that
the
injunction
be
lifted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know,
because
he
said
you
might
go
to
jail
if
you
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
page
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
would
be
the
jurisdiction
of
the
one-judge
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
to
the
(inaudible)
of
the
jurisdiction,
what's
the
federal
jurisdiction
of
the
one-judge
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
what
--
what
basis
of
jurisdiction,
what
further
ground?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
take
it
that
the
--
your
answer
in
it
would
be
you
didn't
have
to
stand
to
enjoin
an
illegal
order
of
the
i.c.c.
you
would
have
to
stand
because
of
your
corporate
rights.
these
are
the
incorporation
if
you
had
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no,
your
right
in
relation
to
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
see
what
the
federal
basis
in
a
one-judge
court
proceeding,
is
the
fact
that
some
or
another
federal
statute
will
be
implicated
by
the
federal
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
that's
--
that's
a
perfect
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
did
the
sec
assert
it,
too?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
memorandum
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
quickly
(inaudible)
don't
let
me
interrupt
your
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
in
that
memorandum,
they
merely
asked
the
commission
to
invoke
its
order
of
subjecting
it
to
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
asked
the
commission,
the
i.c.c.
to
revoke
the
order,
which
presumably,
still
recognized
that
the
alleghany
was
subject
to
i.c.c.'s
jurisdiction,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
note
that's
what
the
memorandum
says.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
i
get
in
touch
is
a
body
that
exercises
discretion.
so,
in
this
jurisdiction,
it's
implied
is
to
retain
jurisdiction
by
exercising
discretion
the
other
way.
if
there's
discretion
then
it
can
work
both
either
in
opposite.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
asking.
i
just
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
order
of
the
i.c.c.
presuppose
the
did
control?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
care
what
reason
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
to
be
assumed
that
a
necessary
ingredient
for
the
i.c.c.
order
is
a
finding
whether
by
assumption
or
by
investigation
or
a
knowledge
of
its
records
that
alleghany
did
control
new
york
central?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
covet
you
to
state
what
you
deem
the
relevant
or
whatever
the
finding
may
have
been
of
the
sec
on
the
plan?
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
it's
before
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
to
the
point
you've
just
made
that
it
would
be
relevant
if
you
can
see
that
there
the
jurisdiction
of
the
i.c.c.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
suppose
you
have
such
right
now.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
suppose
you'd
have
such
right
now.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
this
is
10
months
past
as
to
the
record
of
the
case
before
it's
closure,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
--
but
that
finding
as
to
that
report
--
the
finding
of
the
sec
is
10
months
after
what's
contained
in
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
you
before
the
i.c.c.
on
the
plan
that
the
i.c.c.
passed
on?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
did
you
try
to
get
before
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
--
they
took
no
action
on
your
motion
for
intervention?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
they
said
they
would
let
you
intervene
with
no
formal
order
behind
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no.
that's
before.
you
said
you
were
--
you
--
i
thought
i
i
heard
you
say
that
a
month
before
they've
indicated
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
month
before?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
didn't
you
appear
the
next
day?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
knew
that
they
(inaudible)
[laughs]
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
that
is
your
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
follow
because
they
were
not
officers
of
alleghany
that
they
had
no
connection
with
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
gentleman
named
mr.
young
is
the
(inaudible)
of
the
two?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
no
doubt?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
make
any
difference
if
young
controlled
alleghany
and
thereby
controlled
central?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
any
different
here
as
a
corporate
entity?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
every
--
every
company
which
is
owned
by
an
individual
drops
out
of
a
picture
of
corporate
relationships?
justice
felix
frankfurter
control
of
the
partner
that
that
could
possibly
begin
suppose
he
was
a
dominant
partner
and
alleghany
was
a
junior
partner,
does
that
make
any
--
make
it
any
the
less
of
--
a
non-carrier
corporation
having
control?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
100%
or
50%?
this
court
asserted
from
any
--
very
little
and
he
may
have
been
operated
to
alleghany
as
one
might
suspect
he
did?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
always
true
of
a
dominant
stockholder
in
a
corporation,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
doesn't
drop
the
corporation
out
of
the
legal
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that's
a
different
party?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
think
that
that's
a
proxy
--
proxy
by
the
appellants'
for?
justice
felix
frankfurter
evident
sometimes
--
imagine
that
we
may
put
on
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
you're
not
unfamiliar
with
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
told
you
--
you
indicate
that
most
would
disagree
with
the
statements
which
might
caught
my
eyes,
was
it
not,
with
the
icc
brief
that
alleghany's
allegations
have
not
control
of
new
york
central
or
not
where
there's
a
challenge
and
that's
your
position
that's
in
the
--
the
brief
calls
each
of
the
shifting
an
uncertain
nature.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
would
think
that's
not
unfair
characterization?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
where
he
say,
we
deny?
justice
felix
frankfurter
394?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
that's
why
they
turned
to
shifting,
it
was
meant
to
change
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
argument
on
this
point,
assuming
a
control
point
is
relevant,
your
argument
is
that
we
can
go
behind
the
termination
of
the
icc.
the
alleghany
did
control
the
new
york
central
and
say
it's
without
acquiring
any
evidence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
find
in
your
--
what
--
if
i
follow
your
argument
that
(inaudible)
and
that
inquiring
that
your
(inaudible)
for
which
they
should
have
proceeded
or
acted
thereto
and
assuming
that
the
commission
would
have
found
what
it
did
find
here
that
they
had
control,
as
i
understand
it.
then
all
it
leads
is
that
they
would
now
use
the
effect
it's
brought
under
icc
control
and
in
any
event
the
exigency
is
valid.

(inaudible)
i
put
them
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
assuming
that
they
would've
found
it
then
if
they
found
it
now,
that's
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
not
talking
about
the
other
four.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
brussel,
if
you
say
new
york
central
being
composed
of
or
having
control
of
the
73,
that
73
for
73
are
not
one,
then
i
should
think
--
if
i
would
say
that
in
all
department
merging
two
into
a
new
corporation
of
one
if
something
else
should
ultimately
can't
say
two
equals
two
and
two
equals
one
now?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
there
is
a
change?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
in
your
argument
and
you
asked
me
one
--
in
one
phase
of
your
argument,
you
can
see
(inaudible)
73
and
they
had
to
be
covered
by
one
because
one
invoked
this
form
up.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
so
for
my
--
my
mode
of
reasoning,
it
seems
that
there
were
two
corporations
but
whatever
business
reasons,
two
become
one,
we've
got
a
new
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
therefore,
is
it
the
--
the
control
by
the
new
york
central
of
the
73
constituents,
anything
but
the
control
of
one
thing.never
mind,
there's
nothing
in
this.
there's
nothing
in
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
were
saying
the
statute
may
--
allows
the
commission
to
decide
whether
they
have
held
the
so-called
public
hearing
which
is
in
effect
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
says
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
the
complaint
to
define
something
with
affidavit
wasn't
the
conviction
to
commit
to
a
crime.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
merely
suggesting
that
the
statute
allow
and
i'm
considerably
to
discretion
to
the
commission
to
determine
whether
they
should
have
a
public
hearing
in
which
in
all
the
rest,
oral
hearing
and
when
you
decided
--
when
you
--
when
you
give
a
tribunal
that
kind
of
discretion
one
would
have
to
--
and
so
the
long
way
to
say
it,
they
can't
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
have
to
prove
what
they
did
in
order
to
decide
who
may
have
had
the
power
to
them.
