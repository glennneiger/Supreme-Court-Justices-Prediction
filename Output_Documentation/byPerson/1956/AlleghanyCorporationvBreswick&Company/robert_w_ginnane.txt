mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
devote
myself
initially
and
primarily
to
two
questions
of
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
in
this
case,
which
have
an
importance
to
the
commission
and
we
think
to
the
public
interest
going
way
beyond
the
facts
of
this
immediate
case.
first,
we
contend
that
the
commission
had
jurisdiction
under
section
5
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
to
determine
that
allegheny
corporation
should
be
considered
as
a
carrier
for
the
purpose
of
regulation
of
security
issues
and
for
the
other
specified
regulatory
purposes
specified
in
section
5,
paragraph
(3)
of
the
act.
now,
to
go
back
a
little
bit
into
the
structure
of
section
5.
section
5
(2)
(a)
provides
that
it
shall
be
lawful
with
the
approval
of
the
commission
for
a
person
which
is
not
a
carrier
and
which
already
controls
one
carrier,
to
--
to
acquire
control
of
another
carrier
or
carriers.
and
paragraph
(3)
provides
that
where
such
a
non-carrier
is
thus
authorized
by
the
commission
to
acquire
control
of
a
total
of
two
or
more
carriers
that
such
non-carrier
person
shall
thereafter
to
the
extent
specified
by
the
commission
be
considered
as
a
carrier
subject
to
the
probations
of
section
20
in
the
interstate
commence
act.
section
20
contains
the
--
the
commission's
broad
powers
as
to
reports,
the
form
of
which
accounts
are
kept
and
as
general
--
shall
i
say
visitorial
powers
and
for
the
provisions
of
section
20a,
which
briefly
stated,
"requires
the
commission's
approval
for
the
issuance
of
securities
or
assumption
of
carrier
liabilities."
in
this
case,
the
commission
asserted
jurisdiction
over
allegheny
upon
the
basis
of
two
factors.
first,
it
found
that
allegheny
already
controlled
one
carrier,
new
york
central.
and
secondly,
it
found
that
allegheny
through
its
control
of
central
was
seeking
to
acquire
a
modified
control
over
the
louisville
&
jeffersonville
bridge
company.
a
modify
--
a
modification
of
control
arising
out
of
the
simultaneous
proposal
to
merge
the
bridge
company
into
the
big
four,
a
subsidiary
of
new
york
central.
and
simultaneously,
for
big
four
to
lease
the
bridge
company
properties
to
new
york
central
which
as
i
say
was
under
the
direct
control
of
allegheny.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
did
not
get
the
commission's
authority
and
we
contend
and
i
would
like
to
discuss
it
in
some
detail
that
it
was
not
required
to.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
because
the
commission
regarded
the
integrated
new
york
central
system
as
a
single
carrier.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
may
not
be,
depending
upon
the
commission
and
to
this
court's
resolution
of
various
other
issues.
i
may
say
that
that
problem
that
counsel
contended
in
the
district
court
that
that
problem
was
not
relevant
to
the
case.
the
district
court
found
that
the
commission
could
not
assert
jurisdiction
of
alleghany
as
a
pseudo
carrier
under
section
5
(3),
without
first
to
finding
that
alleghany's
acquisition
of
control
of
new
york
central
was
in
the
public
interest.
so,
the
--
in
effect,
the
issue
was
forced
upon
us.
now,
the
court
below
held
that
since
both
before
and
after
this
merger
and
lease
transactions,
alleghany
had
one
form
of
control
or
another
an
indirect
control
over
the
bridge
company
properties
that
there
was
not
involved
any
acquisition
of
control
over
the
bridge
company
by
alleghany.
in
other
words,
the
court
below
held
that
this
non-carrier
provisions
of
section
--
of
paragraphs
2
and
3
of
section
5
apply
only
to
non-carriers
acquiring
control
over
previously
--
previously
uncontrolled
carriers
and
do
not
apply
to
modifications
of
existing
control
of
carriers.
now,
we
think
that
that's
too
literal,
a
reading
of
section
5
in
view
of
the
sweeping
purposes
of
the
statute.
now,
to
go
back
a
bit,
it's
undisputed
that
the
merger
of
the
bridge
company
into
big
four
and
the
simultaneous
lease
of
the
bridge
company
properties
by
big
four
to
new
york
central
were
transactions
which
require
the
commission's
approval,
the
district
court
so
found
and
sustained
those
--
that
portion
of
the
commission's
order.
and
through
the
years,
the
commission
has
held
repeatedly
that
where
one
carrier
controls
another
carrier,
increases
in
or
modifications
of
carrier
a's
control
of
carrier
b,
require
the
commission's
approval,
because
those
aren't
just
bookkeeping
transactions.
a
carrier
may
have
bare
stock
control
of
another
carrier.
it
can
do
certain
things
under
the
applicable
corporation
law.
if
it
requires
a
two-thirds
stock
control,
it
can
do
more
drastic
things.
in
united
states
v.
marshall
transport,
decided
by
this
court
in
1944,
a
non-carrier
already
controlled
a
carrier
and
that
carrier
then
acquired
the
properties
of
another
carrier.
this
court
held
that
that
transaction
simultaneously
involved
an
acquisition
of
control
by
the
non-carrier
parent
of
the
latter
carrier
of
the
acquired
carrier
and
that
the
non-carrier
parent
must
seek
and
obtain
the
commission's
approval
of
such
an
indirect
acquisition
of
control.
since
the
marshall
transport
case
in
1944,
the
commission
has
held
in
several
cases
that
a
non-carrier
parent
must
obtain
approval
under
section
5
(2)
for
the
modification
of
its
existing
control
of
subsidiaries.
and
i'd
like
to
get
two
examples
of
it.
one,
a
small
case
involving
motor
carriers,
the
commission
held
that
upon
a
merger
of
two
carriers
controlled
by
an
individual,
that
that
individual
must
join
in
the
application
and
seek
and
obtain
the
commission's
approval
for
his
modification
--
for
the
--
the
modification
of
his
control
over
the
two
carriers.
then,
in
a
larger
case,
in
1947,
the
pere
marquette
merger,
the
commission
authorized
under
section
5
(2)
the
merger
of
the
properties
of
the
pere
marquette
railroad
into
chesapeake
in
ohio.
now,
chesapeake
in
ohio
already
had
stock
control
of
pere
marquette.
and
at
the
same
time,
the
commission
found
that
alleghany's
acquisition
of
control
through
its
existing
control
at
chesapeake
in
ohio
of
the
properties
of
pere
marquette
through
that
merger
of
pere
marquette
into
chesapeake
in
ohio
was
a
transaction
which
came
within
the
scope
of
section
5
(2).
now,
we
submit
then
in
--
in
this
case
the
commission
did
substantially
the
same
thing.
it
held
that
section
5
(2)
required
its
approval
of
the
change
or
modification
of
alleghany's
control
of
the
bridge
company
properties
which
resulted
from
the
double
transaction
of
the
merger
of
the
bridge
company
properties
and
the
big
four,
and
the
simultaneous
lease
of
the
--
of
the
bridge
company
properties
by
big
four
to
new
york
central
which
was
directly
controlled
by
--
by
alleghany.
and
we
think
that
that
construction
of
section
5
is
necessary
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
the
act.
that
purpose
shows
not
only
in
the
broad
sweep
of
section
5,
but
in
a
legislative
history
equally
sweeping
in
purpose,
a
purpose
to
place
the
entire
process
of
carrier
consolidation
and
unification
under
public
regulation.
and
as
a
practical
matter,
contrary
to
the
view
to
the
court
below,
this
increases
or
modifications
of
control
can
involve
a
good
deal
more
than
intra-system
bookkeeping
and
the
pere
--
pere
marquette
merger
is
an
example
of
that.
an
increase
in
the
stock
control
of
a
carrier
may
enable
its
direct
or
indirect
non-carrier
parents
to
bring
about
corporate
actions
which
a
lesser
form
of
control
would
not
permit.
the
merger
of
a
carrier
previously
controlled
by
a
stock
ownership
signals
the
end
of
the
possibility
of
independent
operation
of
that
carrier.
and
in
the
history
of
alleghany,
this
is
rather
a
dramatic
illustration
of
that.
some
years
ago,
alleghany
controlled
c
&
o,
pere
marquette,
and
nickel
plate.
through
the
years,
different
factors,
economic
factors,
pere
marquette
was
merged
in
the
c
&
o.
nickel
plate
on
the
other
hand
has
become
a
completely
independent
carrier
competing
vigorously
with
c
&
o.
at
the
same
time,
such
mergers,
such
--
such
rearrangements
of
a
system
will
often
signal
a
change
in
--
in
the
management
or
in
the
policies
of
a
holding
company.
such
a
change
as
would
warrant
the
commission
for
the
first
time
in
subjecting
such
a
non-carrier
parent
to
partial
regulation
as
a
carrier
under
section
5
(3),
particularly
with
respect
to
security
issues.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
minor
stock
acquisitions,
say,
an
increase
in
stock
control
from
55%
to
57%,
the
commission
has
paid
no
attention
to,
but
the
--
the
more
formal,
definite
rearrangement
such
as
mergers
in
particular.
now,
the
commission
has
always
held,
require
its
approval.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
stock
control,
but
not
--
but
not
complete
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
but
not
complete
stock
controls.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
at
the
same
time,
the
lease
of
the
bridge
company
properties
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
by
big
four
to
new
york
central,
a
combination
merger
and
lease
upstream
of
the
properties.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
now,
the
commission
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
pardon?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
where
the
court
below
found
it,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
sir.
well
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
you
--
you
have
the
same
keywords,
both
in
at
the
last
clause
of
5
(2)
and
in
5
(3).
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
it's
5
(2)
and
(3),
and
--
but
the
keywords
are
the
same,
acquire
control
or
acquisition
of
control.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
because
the
commission
held
as
it
--
as
it
is
held
in
some
other
cases
that
--
that
the
phrase,
the
keywords
as
you
call
them,
acquire
control,
acquisition
of
control
and
through
the
acquisition
of
a
changed
or
modified
form
of
control.
the
court
below
held
to
the
contrary
that
the
words
embrace
only
acquisition
of
control
over
a
previously
uncontrolled
carrier.
that
is
a
new
acquisition
of
control
altogether.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
is
the
commission's
position,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
it's
based
upon
what
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
indeed,
the
present
definition
of
control
in
--
in
the
commerce
act
was
deliberately
based
drawn
from
this
court's
decision
on
the
rochester
telephone
case.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
think
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
does
that
--
the
key
question
--
the
key
question
in
this
aspect
of
the
case
is
whether
those
--
those
words
require
control
or
acquisition
of
control,
whether
they
cover
as
a
matter
of
agency
jurisdiction
the
acquisition
of
a
modified
(inaudible)
control
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
a
new
(voice
overlap)
control.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
--
that
was
the
view
of
the
court
below.
that
it
--
that
it
applied
only
to
new
acquisitions
of
control.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
over
--
over
carriers
previously
uncontrolled
in
any
way.
pardon
me,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
and
i
think
i
was
going
a
bit
broader
than
that
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
that
--
that
the
purpose
of
what
--
what
congress
intended
by
the
--
by
this
broad
section
5.
now,
the
commission
believes
that
--
that
if
the
--
the
--
what
congress
intended
above
all
which
is
subject
to
regulation
of
the
whole
process
of
carrier
consolidation
and
integration.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
correct.
yes,
sir.
and
the
commission
cannot
exercise
such
control
under
section
5
(3)
over
a
non-carrier.
unless,
the
non-carrier
is
required
under
section
5
(2)
were
the
same
words
"acquire
control
or
acquisition
of
control
there",
unless
the
non-carrier
is
required
under
section
5
(2)
to
seek
and
obtain
the
commission's
approval
for
such
a
modification
of
control.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
was
acquiring
an
existing
carrier
structure.
it
was
proposing
no
changes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
of
a
carrier.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
is
the
commission's
position
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
and
i
would
like
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right.
it
--
it
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
it
filled
the
central
system
under
--
under
unified
operating
control
as
a
single
carrier.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
couldn't
make
changes
without
approval.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right,
sir.
it
couldn't
add
to
the
system
or
change
it
without
commission
approval.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
for
bridge
company
it
had
been
completely
independent
if
the
system
had
reached
up
for
that.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
--
that
would
--
that
would
require
commission
approval,
too.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
and
the
whole
--
a
wholly
or
big
four
owned
all
of
the
stock
of
the
bridge
company.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
the
big
four
has
--
had
stock
control
of
new
york
central,
not
complete
stock
control.
and
then
new
york
central
had
complete
stock
control
of
big
four.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
not
consistent
with
their
decisions
since
the
marshall
transport
case.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
as
original
matter,
i
suppose
they
could
have.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
assessed
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
it
--
it
has
said
so
in
several
cases.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
--
that
those
--
those
are
the
keywords
in
the
statute.
now,
the
district
court
also
held
that
the
commission's
status
order,
so-called
in
the
bridge
case
was
invalid
because
the
commission
had
not
authorized
alleghany's
acquisition
of
control
of
new
york
central
as
consistent
with
the
public
interest.
i
will
state
that
alleghany
did
seek
or
obtain
the
commission's
approval
of
its
acquisition
of
control
of
new
york
central.
the
commission
found
and
this
is
at
page
511
of
the
record
that
the
new
york
central
railroad
company
is
the
parent
company
of
the
new
york
central
railroad
system,
comprised
of
numerous
carriers
including
several
railroad
systems
and
the
railroads
and
properties
controlled
and
operated
by
those
companies
under
lease
or
otherwise.
when
allegany
by
stock
ownership
and
by
the
favorable
action
of
the
stock
holders
obtained
control
of
central,
all
the
properties
within
the
carriers
of
it,
rather
long
established
single
operating
control
and
the
commission
concluded
that
since
alleghany
was
recognized
as
a
single
established
system,
that
since
central
was
recognized
as
a
single
established
system,
alleghany's
acquisition
of
control
of
central
did
not
constitute
an
acquisition
of
control
of
two
or
more
carriers.
now,
the
district
court
held
squarely
to
the
contrary.
it
held
that
where
a
non-carrier
acquires
control
of
the
parent
corporation
of
a
railroad
system,
it
acquires
control
of
the
subsidiaries
and
consequently
of
two
or
more
carriers.
now,
this
--
this
presents
we
think
a
very
important
jurisdictional
question
under
the
act,
because
section
5
(2)
expressly
permits
a
non-carrier,
holding
company
or
otherwise
to
acquire
control
of
a
single
carrier.
it's
only
the
acquisition
of
control
of
two
or
more
carriers
by
a
non-carrier
which
requires
the
commission's
approval.
now,
as
practical
matter,
many
railroads
and
i
would
not
know
how
many
motor
carriers
consist
of
a
parent
and
subsidiary
corporations
whose
properties
are
integrated
for
operating
purposes
through
leases
and
similar
arrangements.
on
the
other
hand,
some
carriers
for
tax
purposes
or
as
the
result
of
recent
reorganization
proceedings
have
eliminated
such
--
such
subsidiaries
and
hold
all
their
properties
in
the
ownership
of
a
single
corporate
entity.
but
either
way,
it
seems
to
us
that
congress
and
everybody
else
regard
new
haven,
for
example
or
delaware
&hudson
as
a
single
carrier.
but
under
the
decision
below,
every
acquisition
of
control
of
a
single
integrated
carrier
enterprise
consisting
of
two
or
more
corporations
would
require
approval
under
section
5
(2)
and
that
jurisdiction
would
vary
depending
upon
the
internal
organization
arrangements
of
a
particular
carrier
enterprise
whether
it
operated
through
operating
subsidiaries
or
whether
its
operations
were
organized
in
terms
of
unincorporated
operating
divisions.
and
in
its
report,
the
commission
also
pointed
out
the
practical
problems
that
would
arise
if
the
commission's
approval
was
required
for
every
acquisition
of
control
of
a
carrier
consisting
of
a
parent
company
and
one
or
more
subsidiaries.
for
example,
in
recent
years,
there
have
been
successful
practicing
struggles
for
the
acquisition
of
control
over
such
carriers
as
minneapolis
&
st.
louis
and
the
new
haven.
the
commission
does
not
believe
that
congress
intended
it
to
determine
either
before
or
after
such
proxy
contest
whether
a
particular
person
or
identified
group
of
persons
should
be
allowed
to
control
and
operate
a
carrier.
with
it,
congress
made
it
very
clear
that
it
intended
the
commission
to
determine
who
could
or
could
not
control
a
carrier,
only
where
there
was
involved
the
acquisition
of
control
of
two
or
more
carriers.
i'd
like
to
mention
only
one
more
point,
quite
unrelated
to
what
i've
just
been
discussing.
the
court
below
found
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
--
it
would
place
it
in
the
--
in
the
position
as
a
matter
of
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right,
but
--
but
we
think
congress
has
laid
down
the
policy
that
we
shall
pass
that
judgment
only
where
there
is
definitely
involved
control
of
two
or
more
carriers
by
a
non-carrier.
