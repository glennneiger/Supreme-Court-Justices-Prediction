mr.
whitney
north
seymour
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
appellant
side
of
the
case
has
a
total
of
an
hour
and
half
and
for
convenience
i
got
in
touch
with
other
counsel
and
we're
going
to
divide
the
time
on
the
basis
of
--
my
taking
40
minutes
for
alleghany
in
opening
the
case.
mr.
ginnane
taking
25
minutes
for
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
mr.
levin
taking
15
minutes
for
the
preferred
stockholders,
mr.
kahan
taking
two
minutes
for
certain
common
stockholders,
and
if
that
all
works
out
i
hope
that
we'll
end
up
with
eight
minutes
left
for
reply.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i'm
--
i'm
trying
to
hope.
these
are
appeals
from
a
judgment
of
a
three-judge
district
court
in
new
york,
convened
under
the
urgent
deficiencies
act.
the
questions
involved
concerned
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
some
questions
under
the
investment
company
act.
the
judgment,
which
appears
at
page
555,
has
had
a
very
sweeping
impact
on
i.c.c.regulation
and
on
the
company
and
on
its
stockholders.
it
did
three
major
things.
first,
it
enjoined
part
of
a
commission
order
which
continued
jurisdiction
over
alleghany,
which
is
the
company
that
controls
new
york
central,
in
connection
with
an
application
made
in
1954
and
decided
by
the
commission
in
1955
by
alleghany
with
central
and
others,
continuing
its
control
over
alleghany
as
a
non-carrier
controlling
carriers.
the
effect
of
that
portion
of
the
judgment
is
to
oust
--
oust
interstate
commerce
commission
jurisdiction,
not
only
over
alleghany
but
over
other
companies
which
may
be
carrier
holding
companies.
this
jurisdiction
over
alleghany
had
been
exercised
by
the
commission
continuously
since
1945
and
of
course
such
a
result
has
a
far-reaching
effect.
next,
it
set
aside
and
enjoined
an
order
of
the
commission
under
section
20
(a)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
approving
after
a
very
careful
consideration,
a
proposed
issue
by
alleghany
of
six
percent
preferred
stock
to
some
130,000
preferred
stockholders,
preferred
stock
which
was
intended
to
wipeout
about
$18
million
in
accumulated
dividends.
so
the
dividends
might
have
ultimately
be
paid
on
the
common
stock.
this
was
in
the
teeth
of
a
decision
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
with
--
after
hearing
the
appellees,
upholding
the
issue
against
all
the
contention
made
against
it
as
a
proper
security
issue
to
be
issued
by
a
carrier
holding
company.
and
i
think
your
honors
will
see
as
you
scrutinize
this
record
that
the
i.c.c.had
given
the
most
careful
consideration
to
that
question.
and
finally,
going
beyond
any
injunction
against
orders
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
it
undertook
also
to
issue
in
the
most
comprehensive
terms
an
injunction
against
the
effectuation
of
the
exchange
of
the
preferred
stock
which
have
been
approved
by
the
commission
and
which
was
in
process
at
the
time
its
injunction
issued
with
the
effect
that
all
of
this
stock
has
been
substantially
frozen
to
the
great
hardship
of
the
stockholders.
when
the
court
issued
a
temporary
injunction
followed
by
its
interlocutory
injunction,
some
900,000
of
the
new
shares
that
already
issued,
some
400,000
remained
to
issue.
and
ultimately
an
application
was
made
to
mr.
justice
harlan
to
stay
the
injunction,
and
he
stayed
it
as
to
900,000
shares
already
issued,
but
did
not
stay
it
as
to
the
balance
because
that
might
have
well,
mooted
this
appeal.
but
unfortunately,
that
stay
was
ineffective,
substantially
ineffective
because
the
stock
exchange
in
the
light
of
the
temporary
injunction
and
in
the
light
of
the
lawsuit
had
already
substantially
blocked
trading
in
the
securities.
so
that
in
effect,
since
this
injunction
--
this
stock
has
been
completely
frozen
and
the
stockholders
of
the
company
have
been
un
--
able
to
enjoy
their
stock
interest.
now,
its
perfectly
apparent,
i
submit,
from
the
--
from
the
order
on
temporary
injunction,
from
the
opinion
below,
from
the
nature
of
the
appellees'
suit,
that
the
court
thought
it
was
called
upon
to
determine
whether
regulation
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
under
the
investment
company
act
might
be
preferable
to
a
regulation
under
the
interstate
commerce
act,
and
that
this
injunction
was
in
substance
a
choice
by
the
court
for
a
regulation
under
the
investment
company
act.
and
that
was
what
the
plaintiffs
sought,
they
made
it
perfectly
clear,
explicitly
clear
that
the
whole
basis
of
this
suit
was
to
enforce
the
investment
company
act,
and
that
runs
right
through
the
opinions
below.
now,
that
choice
was
in
the
face,
not
only
of
outstanding
orders
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
of
the
s.e.c.,
recognizing
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
had
jurisdiction
here
but
also
in
face
of
the
clear
congressional
choice
represented
by
an
explicit
exemption
in
the
investment
company
act,
that
companies
subject
to
regulation
under
the
interstate
commerce
commission
act
were
not
within
the
investment
company
act.
a
recognition
which
also
obviously
carried
with
it
a
recognition
of
the
desirability
of
having
the
interstate
commerce
commission
regulates
both
carriers
and
the
companies
holding
carriers
which
fall
within
the
statute.
the
--
as
--
as
your
honor
scrutinize
the
opinion
below,
i
think
it's
perfectly
apparent
that
the
changing
basis
upon
which
the
court
justified
its
action
all
really
relate
to
a
kind
of
a
preference
for
regulation
under
the
investment
company
act.
now,
the
urgent
deficiencies
act,
as
i
shall
argue
at
greater
length
later,
certainly
does
not
contemplate
the
exercise
of
general
equity
jurisdiction
by
the
special
three-judge
court,
so
as
to
permit
the
court
to
range
widely
as
a
one-judge
court
might
do.
and
when
the
court
went
so
far
as
to
try
to
use
this
occasion
to
enforce
another
statute
and
to
impose
restrictions
on
the
stockholders
in
order
to
accomplish
that,
it
certainly
exceeded
any
power
confided
to
it
under
the
urgent
deficiencies
act.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
i
think
that
the
three-judge
court
is
grounded
to
an
injunction
which
is
squarely
ancillary
to
the
exercise
of
its
powers
under
the
urgent
deficiencies
act
which
is
to
deal
with
interstate
commerce
commission
orders.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
and
not
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
i
think
its
powers
are
restricted
to
an
exercise
which
is
plainly
ancillary
to
an
exercise
of
its
very
limited
power
to
review
the
interstate
commerce
commission
orders,
and
it
can't
be
as
enterprising
as
equity
courts
generally
can
be
in
reaching
out
and
doing
a
whole
lot
of
other
things.
now,
we
have
before
your
honors
and
obviously
this
makes
the
presentation
a
little
more
comparable
briefs
from
three
different
government
agencies.
there
is
a
brief
here
from
the
interstate
commerce
commission
sustaining
its
jurisdiction
which
we
think
clearly
exists.
there
is
also
a
brief,
sort
of
his
friend
to
the
court,
i
guess,
by
the
department
of
justice
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
in
our
position
to
some
of
the
contentions
made
by
the
appellant.
and
then
there's
a
very
brief
statement
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
which
obviously
enjoys
and
would
like
to
continue
the
jurisdiction
which
it
has
succeeded
in
inheriting
as
a
result
of
this
decision
below.
but
there
are
certain
points
made
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief
or
the
department
of
justice
brief
which
i
think
here
of
considerable
moment
in
appraising
the
opinion
below.
first,
i
ought
to
say
that
the
department
of
justice
below
supported
the
commission
substantially
across
the
board.
and
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
but
in
this
--
the
department
of
justice
brief
here,
it
has
suggested
that
it
wouldn't
do
any
great
harm
to
vacate
the
injunction
granted
below
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
has
now
considered
this
security
in
a
limited
way
and
that
would
avoid
difficult
questions
presented
by
that
injunction.
now,
if
the
question
is
difficult,
it's
difficult
because
just
as
i
have
argued,
the
court
below
issued
an
injunction
to
enforce
the
investment
company
act
which
it
had
no
power
to
do.i
don't
think
that
can
be
disposed
of
by
simply
vacating
the
injunction.
the
--
i'm
trying
to
use
these
--
these
few
minutes
as
effectively
as
i
can
if
your
honors
will
bear
with
me
just
a
moment.
after
the
--
the
reason
the
solicitor
general's
brief
is
written
after
action
by
the
s.e.c.is
that
in
deference
to
the
injunction
granted
by
the
court
below
and
with
no
alternative,
alleghany
made
an
application
to
the
s.e.c.to
exempt
this
--
this
proposed
preferred
stock
issue
from
the
application
in
the
investment
company
act.
and
the
staff
of
the
commission
in
a
report
which
has
been
on
next
i
think
to
mr.
levin's
brief
as
an
appendix,
approved
the
proposed
exemption.
but
the
commission
itself
on
considering
the
matter
by
vote
of
4-to-1,
considering
the
record
too
uncertain
to
take
such
action,
denied
the
exemption
and
that
matter
is
on
appeal.
counsel
on
the
other
side
have
very
much,
i'm
afraid
in
a
natural
desire
to
get
the
full
benefit
out
of
anything
of
that
kind
that
might
seem
to
squint
in
any
direction,
wrapped
themselves
in
this
decision
of
the
s.e.c.to
the
point
where
they
say
that
it
held
this
stock
issue
grossly
unfair.
as
we
pointed
out
in
a
reply
brief,
it
held
no
such
thing.
it
was
a
determination
as
to
--
on
a
very
complicated
record
on
a
matter
which
is
not
properly
before
this
court,
and
which
shall
have
to
be
considered
on
appeal
from
that
decision.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
may
it
please
the
court.
i
shall
now
try
in
the
26
minutes
remaining
to
cover
the
facts
and
the
principal
points
that
we
want
to
have
the
court
hear
us
on.
obviously,
some
of
them
will
have
to
rest
in
the
briefs.
first,
the
chronology
in
1940,
after
passage
of
the
investment
company
act,
the
appellant
allegheny
became
a
registered
investment
company.
as
your
honors
know,
that
act
does
not
cover
all
investment
companies,
but
only
a
limited
number
of
them.
there
are
many
exceptions
and
exemptions.
it
would
be
quite
wrong
to
suppose
that
the
limitations
which
the
court
below
has
put
on
interstate
commerce
commission
jurisdiction
resulted
in
transferring
all
those
potential
carrier
holding
companies
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
sec.
because
it
wouldn't
have
an
effect.
the
particular
exception
which
we
are
concerned
with
here
and
which
we
think
the
court
below
has
inadequately
given
weight
to,
is
that
any
company
subject
to
regulation
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
act
is
not
within
the
investment
company
act.
under
the
interstate
commerce
commission
act,
sections
5
(2)
and
5
(3),
a
company
which
was
a
non-carrier
could
be
brought
under
interstate
commerce
commission
jurisdiction
if
it
sought
to
acquire
in
any
manner
another
carrier
so
that
if
a
company
controlled
two
carriers
in
any
fashion
that
was
subject
to
i.c.c.
jurisdiction
and
control
in
the
interstate
commerce
act
was
defined
in
section
1
subdivision
3
(b)
in
the
very
broadest
terms.
in
1944,
allegheny
controlled
the
c
&
o.and
in
that
year,
it
applied
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
an
order
approving
a
change
in
the
status
of
the
norfolk
terminal
company
applied
with
the
c
&
o
for
approval
of
a
change
in
the
status
and
to
have
allegheny
thus
brought
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
as
a
non-carrier
holding
an
interest
or
controlling
two
carriers.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
those
--
those
entities
were
--
allegheny
controlled
the
c
&
o.
the
c
&
o
had
an
interest
in
the
terminal
company.
the
proposal
was
for
a
change
in
that
relationship
and
thus,
there
was
a
change
in
the
relationship
with
allegheny
and
the
c
&
o.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
think
so,
as
a
result
of
a
change
in
the
nature
of
that
relationship.
this
was
a
change
in
the
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
it
affected
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
it
affected
the
nature
of
its
control
that's
cited
as
i
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes.
if
in
--
different
in
the
nature
of
the
property
or
in
the
nature
of
the
interest.
now,
i'll
come
to
that
more
specifically
in
connection
with
the
later
proceeding.
the
interstate
commerce
commission
granted
that
application,
conceding
that
it
was
following
the
then
very
recent
decision
of
this
court
in
united
states
against
marshall
in
the
322.
and
ever
since
that
time,
the
commission
has
i
think
without
--
certainly,
without
any
substantial
exception,
always
taken
the
view
that
a
company
which
was
in
the
position
of
allegheny
and
which
proposed
a
change
in
the
relationship
to
any
of
the
carriers
involved
was
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission.
and
indeed,
in
the
court
below,
the
government
and
the
commission
both
agree
that
under
the
marshall
case
and
under
the
new
york
central
securities
case,
the
construction
of
the
commission
has
always
put
on
the
statute
was
the
correct
one.
so,
the
commission
in
1945
brought
allegheny
as
a
non-carrier
under
its
regulation.
that
order
explicitly
provided
that
it
should
be
considered
a
carrier
unless
and
until
otherwise
ordered
by
the
commission.
that
order
appearing
at
the
record
page
183.
and
ever
since
that
time,
allegheny
has
continued
to
be
a
non-carrier
subject
to
the
regulation
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
in
1945,
when
the
sec
discovered
the
action
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
or
it
was
brought
to
its
attention,
the
sec
held
a
hearing
and
entered
an
order
concluding
that
allegheny
was
no
longer
an
investment
company,
but
was
subject
to
regulation
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
was
accepted
from
the
investment
company
act.
and
that
order
also
provided
that
if
in
the
future,
allegheny
ceases
to
be
subject
to
regulation
under
the
interstate
commerce
act,
the
sec
order
might
be
revoked,
suspended
at
or
suspended
after
notice
and
hearing.
that
order
is
still
outstanding
and
has
never
been
revoked.
thus,
both
commissions
in
1945
explicitly
held
that
allegheny
was
subject
the
regulation
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
both
commissions
ordered
that
their
order
should
be
continue
until
revoked
and
indeed
the
statute's
applicable
to
both
commissions,
made
that
provision
a
necessary,
consequence
of
any
order,
anyhow.
so,
we
have
a
situation.
we
start
with
the
situation
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
asserted
and
never
relinquished
jurisdiction
over
allegheny
and
the
sec
conceded
and
never
canceled
its
order
recognizing
that
jurisdiction.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes,
i'm
coming
that
right
now.
in
1954,
allegheny
completed
its
disposition
of
its
c
&
o
holdings.
it
notified
the
interstate
commerce
commission
that
having
divested
itself,
it
considered
itself
free
to
acquire
an
interest
in
new
york
central
and
thereupon,
proceeded
in
a
--
what
was
a
notable
proxy
battle
to
gain
control
of
new
york
central.
now,
there's
no
real
question
here
i
think
about
that
operation
although,
i'll
come
to
two
matters
connection
--
connected
with
it.
the
court
below
thought,
and
i
think
the
appellees
contend,
that
it
was
necessary
to
obtain
interstate
commerce
commission
approval
for
that
acquisition,
but
it
seems
quite
clear
from
the
commission's
interpretation
of
its
statute
that
it
has
never
taken
the
view
that
acquiring
one
carrier
required
its
approval
even
though
a
very
important
carrier
was
involved.
and
so,
there
was
no
failure
i
think
to
comply
with
the
statute
in
not
applying
for
approval
of
the
acquisition
in
new
york
central.
your
honors
will
see
at
once
that
applying
to
get
leave
to
win
a
proxy
contest
or
approve
the
winning
of
a
proxy
contest
would
make
such
contest
virtually
impossible.
but,
however
that
may
be,
immediately
after
that,
allegheny
again
made
application
to
the
commission
and
the
commission
reasserted
and
continued
its
jurisdiction.
so,
even
if
there
was
any
need
to
get
approved
of
the
new
york
central
acquisition
which
we
think
that
clearly
was
not,
the
commission
continued
its
jurisdiction.
now,
appellees
raised
some
question
about
whether
in
fact
allegheny
controlled
new
york
central.
i
don't
propose
to
spend
much
time
on
that
because
i
think
it's
probably
plain
on
this
record
that
there
is
no
such
question
that
your
honors
need
to
be
concerned
with.
the
commission
made
very
full
and
adequate
findings
on
that
subject.
and
under
the
broad
control
which
they
were
entitled
to
determine,
i
think
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
it.
i
mean
the
appellee,
breswick
at
page
322
of
the
record
in
one
of
the
many
papers
that
were
filed
by
brewick
with
the
commission
conceded
the
control.
in
the
court
below,
the
government
agreed
that
there
was
control.here,
the
government
doesn't
discuss
the
matter
but
assumes
it
arguendo.
and
i
don't
think
your
honors
will
have
any
doubt
about
it
and
i
don't
spend
--
propose
to
spend
any
time
on
it.
after
allegheny
acquired
control
of
central
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
that
wasn't
the
final
disposition
of
the
case.
that
the
final
--
there
was
some
suggestion
in
the
earlier
opinion
that
some
further
finding
might
be
appropriate.
but
in
the
end,
the
injunction
was
simply
a
flat
injunction,
without
any
direction
for
recommitting
it
to
the
commission
and
i
take
it
that
that
was
their
ultimate
disposition.
as
your
honor
will
see,
examining
the
opinion
on
the
temporary
injunction
and
the
opinion
on
the
final
injunction,
the
court
shifted
its
position
a
little
bit
between
those
two
things.
certainly,
it
did
not
remand
it
to
the
commission
for
a
finding.
after
allegheny
got
the
control
of
--
of
central,
the
commission
raised
some
question
about
whether
ought
to
terminate
its
1945
order
which
was
based
upon
the
application
in
the
c
&
o
case.
and
at
allegheny's
request,
it
postponed
action
on
that
suggestion
because
allegheny
said
that
it
was
about
to
apply
for
a
further
order
from
the
commission.
sec
also
inquired
about
the
possibility
of
terminating
its
order,
but
postponed
any
consideration
of
that
matter.
and
thereupon,
shortly
after
that
question
was
raised,
allegheny
joined
with
central
in
one
of
the
two
critical
matters
which
i
think
are
raised
by
this
record,
in
applying
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
approval
of
a
change
in
the
control
of
the
louisville
bridge
company.
and
that
was
a
situation
which
contemplated
a
merger
of
the
bridge
company
into
the
big
four
and
a
change
in
the
lease
between
big
four
and
central.
now,
i
submit
that
those
were
significant
changes
in
the
relationship
of
the
general
order
of
the
changes
which
your
honors
held
in
the
new
york
central
security's
case
required
participation
and
the
matter
was
fully
considered
by
the
commission.
the
commission
granted
that
application
after
full
consideration
and
issued
an
order
continuing
the
jurisdiction
over
allegheny
as
a
company,
as
a
non-carrier
which
should
be
treated
as
a
carrier.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
i
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
--
i
--
i
suppose
it
could
have.
it
was
--
it
was
before
anybody
could
oppose
the
merger,
any
interested
person.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
the
theory
i
think
of
the
new
york
central
security's
case
is
that
if
there's
any
tightening
or
strengthening
of
control,
at
least
that
and
the
marshall
case
have
so
been
interpreted
for
years
by
the
commission.
the
commission
could
take
jurisdiction
and
regulate
the
non-carrier
applicant.
i
would
suppose
that
it
would
affect
--
it's
bound
to
affect
the
ultimate
interest
of
allegheny
in
some
way
when
the
corporate
life
of
one
of
the
parties
theretofore,
an
independent
company
was
ended
by
the
merger.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
i
should
--
yes.
obviously,
it
would
have
to
have
something
in
the
nature
of
control
of
an
--
of
two
carriers
in
order
to
be
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
--
to
be
there.
now,
you
can
express
it
in
terms
of
interest
or
in
terms
of
control.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
the
commission,
of
course,
has
a
very
considerable
interest
under
its
statute
in
controlling
and
regulating
the
activities
of
such
companies.
and
if
there
is
control
to
bring
it
within
the
statute,
i
should
think
the
commission
was
in
a
position
where
it
could
exert
regulation
over.
now,
the
order
in
this
--
in
this
bridge
company
proceeding
which
appears
at
the
record
at
page
446
did
several
things.
first,
it
directed
that
allegheny
as
a
non-carrier
should
be
subject
to
the
regulation
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
second,
having
just
asserted
its
--
its
regulation
by
that
paragraph,
it
vacated
its
earlier
order
which
was
related
to
the
c
&
o.and
the
proper
interpretation
and
the
proper
way
to
begin
with
that
order
is
one
of
the
questions
in
the
case.
prior
to
the
time
that
order
was
entered,
the
sec
intervened
and
without
raising
any
question
about
the
--
the
jurisdiction
of
the
i.c.c.
indicated
that
it
would
be
a
nice
thing
if
the
i.c.c.
would
turn
the
jurisdiction
over
to
the
sec,
but
the
i.c.c.
declined
to
do
it.
now,
i
submit
that
it's
perfectly
apparent
from
this
course
of
events
with
the
i.c.c.
regulating
and
--
and
having
allegheny
under
its
regulation
from
1945
until
its
order
in
1955,
that
it
was
not
intending
to
terminate
its
control
over
allegheny
unless
it's
reassertion
of
regulation
in
that
order.
its
continuation
of
jurisdiction
in
that
order
was
affected.
and
yet,
the
court
below
--
i'll
have
--
i'll
come
back
to
this
at
this
time
and
that
the
other
side
and
the
--
the
department
of
justice
suggests
in
this
court
although
the
department
of
justice
i
think
took
the
other
view
below
that
determination
of
that
19
--
that
the
termination
provision
of
that
1945
order
terminated
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
jurisdiction.
now,
it's
perfectly
apparent
that
that
was
a
sort
of
a
conditional
determination
conditioned
upon
its
continue
--
continued
jurisdiction
under
the
earlier
order.
now,
while
the
application
in
the
bridge
company
matter
was
pending,
allegheny
joined
with
central
in
another
application,
seeking
the
same
sort
of
approval
and
the
same
sort
of
an
order
in
connection
with
the
change
in
the
relationship
to
the
boston
&
albany
and
two
other
carriers.
and
those
carriers
had
formerly
been
under
lease
to
the
central
and
this
was
a
--
a
request
for
approval
of
the
acquisition
of
their
stock.
and
the
commission
granted
that
application,
but
it
granted
it
20
days
after
the
bridge
company
application.
it
made
it
clear
that
it
was
doing
so
consistently
with
its
disposition
to
the
bridge
company
application.
but
having
only
20
days
before
entered
an
order
expressly
asserting
that
allegheny
was
a
non-carrier
subject
to
its
regulation.
it
did
not
repeat
that
formula
in
that
order
and
the
court
below
and
the
other
side
take
the
view
that
the
absence
of
a
reference
to
that
same
continued
regulation
somehow
makes
that
order
ineffective
as
regulation.
now,
i
submit
that
you
have
to
take
those
orders
together.
they
all
represent
an
assertion
of
control
over
allegheny
under
circumstances
which
gave
the
commission
control
and
that
to
give
the
weight
in
these
circumstances
to
the
absence
of
that
particular
phrase
or
clause
in
that
order,
disregard
substance
in
favor
or
form.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
the
bridge
--
well
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
the
bridge
order
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
no,
no,
the
argument
is
that
the
commission
had
no
jurisdiction
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
--
to
enter
the
order
where
there
was
a
mere
tightening
or
change
of
control.
thus,
that
the
jurisdiction
assuming
order
is
invalid
whereas
the
termination
part
of
the
order
is
valid.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
that's
the
reason
that
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
but
that's
a
formula
of
objection,
isn't
it?
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes,
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
--
i
think
so.
the
court
below
having
had
that
order
cited
to
them
gave
it
no
weight
and
i
submit
that
the
two
orders
together
are
established,
continued
regulation
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
yes,
mr.
justice?
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
and
ultimately
approved
by
the
full
commission.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
now,
so,
we
have
to
two
orders
by
the
commission.
we
have
one
order
in
the
bridge
company
case,
one
order
in
the
boston
&
albany
case,
and
then,
we
have
the
problem
of
the
stock
order.
my
warning
signal
is
gone.
i've
got
five
minutes
and
i'm
going
to
hurry
if
i
may
over
the
balance
of
this
matter
because
i
want
to
be
sure
to
--
to
pose
the
major
problems
to
your
honors.
the
--
the
directors
of
allegheny
decided
in
december
1954
that
a
--
an
exchange
of
preferred
stock
ought
to
be
worked
out
which
would
dispose
of
$18
million
of
accumulated
back
dividends
on
preferred
which
hold
over
any
dividend
granting
on
the
common.
that
proposal
was
submitted
to
stockholders
in
the
early
part
of
1955.
before
it
was
submitted
to
stockholders,
a
proxy
embodying
a
very
full
statement
of
the
--
all
considerations
affecting
the
stock.
it
proposed
the
exchange
offer
was
put
through
the
sec
in
the
regular
way
and
all
changes
suggested
by
the
sec
were
adopted.
the
proposal
was
put
to
the
stockholders,
97.5%
of
the
common
stock
represented
at
the
meeting
or
70%
of
all
the
common
voted
for
it
and
a
very
substantial
majority
of
the
others.
the
matter
was
fully
presented
to
the
commission
for
approval.
the
commission
approved
it
and
issued
an
order
of
approval
at
the
end
of
march
and
--
or
at
the
end
of
may,
and
the
--
under
the
terms
of
the
offer.
the
offer
became
effective
and
closed
on
june
6
and
everybody
who
had
submitted
their
stock
for
exchange
prior
to
june
6
was
entitled
to
get
their
stock
after
june
6,
the
new
stock
after
june
6.
and
then,
the
appellees
who
had
intervened
before
the
commission
filed
a
motion
for
reargument
and
filed
this
suit.
now,
i
want
to
just
make
--
make
a
reference
to
the
circumstances
under
which
the
temporary
injunction
was
issued.
by
filing
their
application
for
reargument
before
the
commission,
they
tied
up
the
proceedings
in
the
commission.
june
6
was
the
last
day
when
anybody
could
withdraw
stocks
submitted
for
exchange
so
that
everybody
was
frozen
in
on
june
6.
then,
they
filed
this
suit
in
the
court
below
and
this
suit
in
its
original
form
was
a
suit
to
enjoin
the
bridge
company
order,
nothing
about
any
stock
order,
nothing
about
the
stock
issue.
the
only
parties
in
the
original
action
were
the
commission
and
the
united
states.on
june
16th,
the
plaintiffs
made
a
motion
for
a
temporary
injunction.
it
was
returnable
on
june
23rd.
at
their
request,
as
i
understand
it,
the
--
the
matter
was
adjourned
to
june
30th,
but
at
least
it
wasn't
at
allegheny's
request.
allegheny
wasn't
a
party
and
when
allegheny
sought
on
june
21st
to
intervene,
its
proposed
intervention
was
rejected
by
the
other
side.
on
june
22nd,
the
commission
order
approving
the
stock
issue
came
down,
came
to
allegheny's
attention
on
june
23rd.
they
were
obligated
by
their
agreement
with
their
stockholders
to
start
exchanging
stock
immediately,
and
they
did
so.and
the
afternoon
of
that
day,
the
temporary
restraining
order
was
issued.
now,
here
was
a
situation
in
which
plaintiffs
who'd
been
fully
heard
in
the
commission
who
brought
a
suit
not
naming
allegheny,
who
did
not
in
the
suit
has
filled,
ask
any
relief
against
the
stockholder,
whose
temporary
--
whose
temporary
injunction
application
didn't
involve
the
stock.
and
directors
and
officers
faced
with
a
potential,
very
heavy
liability
to
stockholders
because
if
the
market
had
gone
down
and
they
failed
to
make
good
on
the
exchange,
they
would
have
been
liable.
and
so,
they
proceeded
to
start
to
make
the
exchange
and
the
temporary
injunction
issued
and
ultimately
a
preliminary
injunction
issued.
as
your
honors
will
see,
judge
hincks
dissented.
his
view
was
that
this
was
not
a
proper
suit
under
the
urgent
deficiencies
act
that
the
plaintiffs
were
trying
to
enforce
the
investment
company
act
which
was
not
a
proper
purpose.
his
opinion
is
cast
in
terms
of
absence
of
--
of
irreparable
damage,
but
that's
obviously
what
he's
talking
about.
i'm
very
sorry,
but
my
--
i
must
keep
my
obligation
about
time.
may
i
say
just
one
word
more
and
then
i'll
sit
down.
we
submit
that
these
orders
of
the
commission
were
valid
and
effective
and
that
allegheny
has
been
subject
to
commission
jurisdiction
and
subject
to
the
commission's
approval
of
this
preferred
stock
and
that
the
injunction
should
be
reversed
not
on
the
--
the
rather
informal
grounds
suggested
by
the
solicitor
general,
but
because
it
is
--
it
was
a
--
an
injunction
which
the
court
below
had
no
right
to
issue
that
it
has
ousted
the
interstate
commence
commission
of
jurisdiction
long
enjoyed
and
--
and
which
congress
has
imposed
upon
it
and
that
this
injunction
has
had
the
most
disastrous
effect
upon
the
company
and
upon
its
stockholders.
now,
every
other
question
i
must
leave
on
the
briefs
is
a
grave
question
about
the
standing
of
these
plaintiffs
to
maintain
this
action,
a
very
grave
question
about
the
--
i
think
there's
no
real
question
about
the
jurisdiction
of
the
i.c.c.
they
raised
some
procedural
questions.
i
think
we've
got
them
fully
dealt
on
the
briefs
and
i
won't
take
anymore
of
your
time.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
have
a
problem.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
may
it
please
the
court,
i
realized
that
i
only
have
a
few
minutes
and
i'll
push
right
along.
first
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes,
i
will,
your
honor.
first,
the
requirement
that
there
should
be
an
application
to
the
icc
for
approval
of
the
bridge
company
merger
and
lease
and
of
the
boston
and
albany
transaction
is
squarely
required
by
your
decision
in
the
new
york
central
securities
case,
which
has
been
followed
for
more
than
20
years
and
which
lays
it
down
that
any
change
in
form
of
control
as
an
acquisition
of
control
under
the
statute,
there's
nothing
new
or
novel
about
the
doctrine,
it's
been
followed
by
the
commission
in
hundreds
of
cases.
the
government
seeks
to
distinguish
it
in
this
case
because
it
says
that
that
case
involved
a
lease
transaction
but
so
does
the
bridge
company
proceeding
here
and
my
very
friend,
the
solicitor
general,
simply
overlooked
that
in
making
that
distinction.
now,
counsel
on
the
other
side
persuaded
the
court
below
that
a
special
urgent
deficiencies
court
should
enforce
other
statutes
and
not
merely
review
the
icc
orders,
and
apparently
he
seeks
here
to
try
his
minority
stockholder
suit
which
is
pending
in
a
one-judge
court
below
because
his
argument
has
been
full
of
references
outside
the
record,
many
of
them,
in
exact,
and
i
shall
try
to
medium
on
those.
your
honors
will
have
notice
that,
again
and
again,
he
referred
to
things
which
are
not
in
this
record
at
all,
which
transpired
after
this
docket
has
closed.
and
on
the
question
that
control
of
new
york
central,
i
submit
that
the
findings
of
the
commission
clearly
determine
that
new
york
central
was
controlled
by
alleghany,
certainly
it
--
it
was
controlled
by
alleghany
along
with
alleghany's
nominees
and
this
is
taken
directly
from
a
statement
made
by
the
plaintiff
or
appellee,
breswick,
at
page
322,
in
which
he
said
by
a
reason
of
said
prohibited
and
unlawful
acts,
alleghany
corporation
and
it's
nominees
were
successful
in
acquiring
on
june
14,
1954
the
control
of
the
new
york
central
railroad
company
and
its
system
companies
and
that
it's
continued
since.
now,
i
don't
think
it's
an
inadequate
answer
to
that
kind
of
a
deliberate
statement
to
the
commission
that
that's
only
the
first,
out
of
seven
or
eight
pleadings
which
varied
all
over
the
line,
i
think
the
commission
was
entitled
to
take
into
account
that
it
is
not
dealing
here
with
amateurs
but
with
professionals
who
make
these
statements
and
that
when
a
statement
like
that
is
made,
the
fact
that
later
for
other
reasons,
some
other
statement
may
be
made
is
no
reason
to
disregard
this
statement.
there
was
adequate
evidence
to
sustain
the
commission's
findings
and
under
the
decision
in
the
rochester
case,
which
is
referred
to
this
morning,
the
court
shouldn't
consider
disturbing
those
findings.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes,
sir.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
think
plainly
they
were
not
necessary
parties.
the
commission
has
not
followed
the
practice
of
adding
individuals
to
touch
a
control
to
such
a
proceeding
and
as
regarded,
as
i
understand
it,
the
control
over
the
holding
company
as
the
supervision
that
it
need,
but
even
assuming
that
it
went
to
that
point,
i
don't
see
what
standing
the
plaintiffs
have
to
make
an
objection
to
that
--
to
--
to
that
result.
now
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
and
i'll
come
--
i'll
answer
that
right
now.
the
point
is
made
--
was
made
for
the
first
time
in
appellee's
brief
that
there's
some
distinction
between
a
lessor
and
a
carrier
as
to
the
requirement
of
getting
approval
under
section
5
(2).
we've
analyzed
that
argument
in
our
reply
brief.
it's
perfectly
clear
that
even
though
for
some
purposes
a
company
may
be
a
lessor.
if
it
is
a
railroad
company
and
a
carrier,
it
must
get
approval
under
5
(2).
the
case
cited
by
counsel
is
a
decision
dealing
with
the
question
of
whether
a
particular
company
was
entitled
to
a
separate
rate
and
hasn't
anything
to
do
with
the
question
here.
and
mr.
ginnane
tells
me
that
there
are
two
decisions
in
the
commission
holding
that
a
--
because
the
company
may
be
a
lessor,
it's
nevertheless
a
carrier
in
261
i.c.c.
623
and
in
257
i.c.c.796.
and
i
think
--
submit
there's
nothing
in
the
point
that
boston
and
albany
case,
standing
alone
without
anything
more,
is
enough
to
establish
continued
regulation
by
the
commission.
and
it's
perfectly
plain
that
if
any
defects
existed
in
any
earlier
orders,
the
commission
would
have
asserted
jurisdiction
again
over
alleghany
in
connection
with
that
proceeding.
and
except
for
the
point
about
the
lessor,
which
is
absolutely
without
merit,
no
one
challenges
the
validity
of
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
by
the
commission
in
that
case.
now,
may
i
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
all
right.
i
just
want
to
add
one
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
--
one
point
if
i
may.
counsel
has
referred
to
alleged
over
reaching
by
mrs.
young
and
kirby
to
allege
profits
by
mr.
's
young
and
kirby.
and
to
things
of
that
kind,
i
submit
that
if
there
were
time,
we
could
litigate
those
questions
here
but
this
isn't
the
place
for
it.
those
are
matters
which
have
been
repeatedly
denied
and
have
no
proper
place
in
--
in
the
--
the
disposition
of
this
matter.
the
scc
made
no
such
findings,
the
staff
finding
is
to
the
contrary
and
that
finding
was
not
disturbed
by
the
commission.
finally,
on
this
point,
counsel
rather
suggested
that
the
scc
always
challenged
the
jurisdiction
of
the
icc
and
i
submit
that
while
the
scc
showed
a
preference
for
having
the
jurisdiction
transferred
to
it,
a
preference
which
congress
had
pretty
well
taken
care
off
by
the
terms
of
the
investment
company
act,
it
always
recognized
the
jurisdiction
of
the
icc
and
there
is
still
an
outstanding
order
of
the
scc
continuing
that
jurisdiction.
and
therefore,
i
submit
that
the
judgment
should
be
reversed
in
its
entirety.
