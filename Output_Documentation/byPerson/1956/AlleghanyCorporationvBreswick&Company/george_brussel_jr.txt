mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
this
court.
there
are
seven
parties
before
the
court
on
these
appeals.
alleghany
corporation
controlled
by
mr.
young
and
his
chairman
and
mr.
kirby,
its
president.
adelaide
neuwirth,
represented
by
mr.
kahan
who
just
spoke,
who
was
a
common
stockholder
but
who
does
not
appeal
from
the
jurisdictional
questions
involved
in
the
judgement
below,
who
merely
appeals
from
the
injunctive
provisions
of
the
judgement
and
who
took
no
active
part
in
the
proceedings
below.
and
there
is
the
one
preferred
stockholder
represented
by
mr.
levin,
gruss
&company,
a
new
york
stock
exchange
firm.
we
have
the
interstate
commerce
commission
who
identifies
with
alleghany
in
this
case,
except
on
the
question
of
standing
to
sue
and
except
as
to
the
laws
of
alleghany's
carrier
status
on
january
19,
1954,
in
which
respects,
it
identifies
with
our
position.
we
have
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
which
has
supported
the
appellees
in
this
case
on
all
investment
company
aspects
of
the
case,
as
set
forth
in
its
brief
amicus.
and
the
united
states
who
did
not
appeal
from
the
judgement
below,
who
instead
has
filed
a
brief
here
in
which
it
has
confessed
error.
may
i
read
briefly
from
the
government
brief
at
page
18
in
which
it
sets
its
position
for?
in
the
district
court,
the
united
states
supported
the
i.c.c.
in
defending
its
orders.
however,
upon
for
the
study
of
the
issues
and
upon
consideration
of
the
court's
opinions,
the
united
states
has
concluded
that
the
district
court
correctly
held
(1)
that
alleghany
did
not
acquire
control
under
section
5
(2)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
of
the
bridge
company
through
the
merger
of
the
latter
with
the
big
four.
and
that
the
i.c.c.
therefore
had
urged
in
subjecting
alleghany
to
carrier
status.
and
(2),
that
1945
status
order
was
terminated
by
this
order
in
the
merger
proceedings.
under
this
view,
the
i.c.c.
orders
authorizing
the
preferred
stock
issue
were
invalid
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
and
then
finally,
we
have
the
three
common
stockholders
whom
i
represent
and
who
for
two
long
years
and
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
say
so,
quite
along
have
raised
the
question
of
the
nullity
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
orders
and
the
importance
in
the
public
interest
of
alleghany
registration
and
its
subjection
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
propositions
now
supported
both
by
the
united
states
and
by
the
sec.
they
sue
not
only
in
their
own
right
as
stockholders,
but
in
the
right
of
the
entire
class.
now,
this
appeal
is
from
a
unanimous
judgement
of
the
three-judge
court,
including
the
late
judge
frank,
judge
dimock
and
judge
walsh.
the
court
below
decided
five
substantive
questions
and
every
one
of
them
was
resolved
in
favor
of
the
appellees.
but
actually,
a
finding
on
anyone
of
them
will
dispose
of
this
appeal
and
require
affirmance
of
the
judgement
below.
the
decision
of
the
court
below
was
synthesized
in
two
or
three
sentences
which
i
take
the
liberty
of
reading.
quoting,
“we
believe
that
the
i.c.c.
had
no
appropriate
application
before
it
for
a
determination
of
the
question
of
the
control.
the
case
cannot
therefore
be
remanded
for
such
a
determination.
the
i.c.c.'s
orders
purported
to
determine
the
question
of
control
of
central,
but
that
determination
cannot
stand,
(a)
because
the
findings
as
to
alleghany's
control
of
central
are
insufficient.
(b)
because
the
evidence
does
not
support
this
findings
and
(c)
because
plaintiffs
were
deprived
of
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
that
issue
of
control.
there
was
one
other
substantive
issue
in
the
case,
which
has
been
the
subject
of
colloquy
between
court
and
counsel
in
the
argument
that
proceeded.
and
that
was
whether
the
merger
was
authorized,
of
whether
--
whether
the
merger
authorized
i.c.c.jurisdiction
or
provided
the
basis
for
it.
and
concerning
that
question,
the
court
said
this.
quote,
"but
where
as
the
instant
case
the
non-carrier
alleghany
is
according
to
our
assumption
arguendo
already
in
indirect
control
of
such
property.
no
acquisition
by
the
non-carrier
results
from
the
merger.”
this
seems
to
us
the
plain,
clear
and
obvious
interpretation
of
the
statute.
now,
at
the
threshold
we're
presented
with
the
reviewability
and
standing
to
sue
questions.
all
the
i.c.c.o
rders
reviewable.
do
we
have
standing
to
sue?
the
i.c.c.
doesn't
challenge
our
standing
to
sue
and
the
united
state
agrees
that
we
have
standing
to
sue.
the
district
court
held
that
the
orders
were
reviewable.
it
confirmed
all
right
to
challenge
them.
it
pointed
out
that
the
orders
had
caused
us
direct
and
substantial
injury,
that
our
stock
was
threatened
with
dilution
and
if
anything
more
were
needed
to
point
up
the
adversity
of
our
position
from
that
of
alleghany's,
we
have
it
in
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
decision
of
november
30,
1956,
when
by
virtue
of
its
findings
of
unfairness
to
the
common
stockholders
and
i
shall
demonstrate
that
that
is
in
the
record
and
that
my
statement
is
correct.
our
position
was
both
adverse
to
alleghany
and
adverse
to
the
preferred
stockholders
specifically,
on
that
very
question.
the
result
of
the
i.c.c.
order
approving
the
preferred
stock
plan
was
to
increase
the
dividend
on
the
new
--
new
preferred
stock
from
5.5%
to
6%.
that
directly
hurt
the
common
stock.
in
addition,
the
i.c.c.
orders
--
ordered
the
conversation
ratio.
that
is
the
number
of
shares
which
the
--
which
the
new
stock
would
command.
the
number
of
common
stock
shares
which
the
new
stock
would
command
if
the
conversation
rights
were
exercised
and
increase
them
from
34
to
47.
and
then,
of
course,
in
addition
to
section
18
(d)
as
the
sec
found,
bars
the
use
of
this
call
on
the
common
stock
by
the
preferred
stockholders
as
a
matter
of
law.
although
as
we
say
it
confirmed
our
right
to
sue,
they
were
specific
findings
by
the
sec.
they
are
implicit
in
the
judgement
of
the
court
below.
according
to
alleghany's
view
we
have
no
remedy
in
any
court.
they
say
that
they
argued
in
opposition
to
a
motion
that
we
made
before
judge
walsh
sitting
as
a
single
judge
in
a
derivative
action
which
our
clients
had
started
against
alleghany,
that
we
were
not
entitled
to
a
temporary
injunction
in
that
one-judge
court.
and
they
succeeded
in
persuading
judge
walsh
to
deny
the
motion
and
judge
walsh
did
so
remitting
us
to
our
administrative
remedies
before
the
i.c.c.
the
nub
of
this
decision
was
that
we
haven't
exhausted
our
remedies
there.
pursuant
to
the
direction
in
his
judgment
we
did
go
before
the
i.c.c.
and
these
--
this
judgment
raises
the
orders
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
now,
your
honors,
if
we're
wrong
on
every
phase
of
this
question
of
standing
to
sue
we
say
that
the
judgment
below
stands
as
a
judgment
of
a
one-judge
district
court.
that
is,
the
three-judge
district
court
may
be
--
the
judgment
may
be
considered
as
a
one-judge
court
and
that
the
--
contrary
to
what
alleghany
argues
in
its
brief,
it
was
not
necessary
for
us
to
join
the
directors
in
this
case
in
order
to
have
a
sufficient
complaint
in
law
before
the
three-judge
court,
because
that
question
is
not
reviewable
here.
and
secondly,
its
--
is
--
the
fact
is
that
we
sued
individually
and
representatively
and
in
neither
situation
were
we
required
to
join
directors.
in
other
words,
we
had
a
right
to
seek
an
injunction
against
what
we
considered
to
be
a
--
a
preferred
stock
plan
that
was
inequitable
and
unfair
to
us
and
that
was
being
promulgated
pursuant
to
avoid
i.c.c.
order.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
to
grant,
find
a
relief
to
us
as
--
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
to
enjoin
--
to
enjoin
alleghany.
do
you
mean
what
are
the
grounds
of
--
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
well,
we're
--
we're
dealing
here
with
federal
statutes,
with
the
investment
company
act
and
the
interstate
commerce
act.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
no,
our
rights
as
against
the
corporation
as
a
whole,
not
the
right
--
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
--
not
in
the
--
in
the
right
of
the
corporation.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
well,
we
have
diversity
of
citizenship
in
addition,
your
honor,
that
--
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
now
--
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
with
the
i.c.c.?
oh,
yes
we
did.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
and
we
asked
to
be
heard
and
we
never
were.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
no,
sir.
we
were
holders
of
common
stock
--
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
--
contesting
the
right
of
the
commission
--
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
no,
to
reprove
the
preferred
stock
plan,
which
would
give
the
holders
of
the
preferred
an
option
--
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
--
to
call
on
and
convert
some
of
their
shares
into
common
stock.
we
were
contesting
that.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
i
beg
pardon,
sir?
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
yes
sir,
we
did.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
when
i
--
when
--
when
--
my
answer
to
your
question
is
that
we
pleaded,
but
we
were
not
heard.
and
in
our
pleadings,
we
raised
the
question
which,
your
honor,
suggests.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
oh,
yes.
we
reviewed
that
order
and
that's
one
of
the
two
orders
that
are
--
that
are
under
review
and
presented
for
determination
--
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
yes,
that's
right.
two
orders,
one
--
one
by
which
the
securities
--
by
which
the
i.c.c.
assumed
jurisdiction
over
alleghany,
which
has
been
referred
to
here
as
the
status
order
or
the
jurisdiction
assuming
order.
and
the
other,
the
order
by
which
it
approved
the
preferred
stock
plan.
the
second
followed
the
first.
now,
as
we
see
the
issues
here
in
this
case
with
respect
to
injunction
to
which
i'm
going
to
address
myself
first
because
of
mr.
levin's
approach
to
this
question.
was
the
district
court
powerless
merely
because
it
was
an
urgent
deficiencies
act
court,
to
maintain
the
status
quo
--
quo
by
an
appropriate
injunction?
wasn't
obliged
to
stand
by
powerless
while
a
--
a
defiant
party,
disregarding
the
pending
proceedings
which
could
have
been
determined
within
a
few
days
deliberately
and
i
should
try
to
demonstrate
this
deliberately
disrupted
the
status
quo
in
order
to
present
the
district
court
with
(inaudible)
common
plea,
which
it
considered
would
be
beyond
the
power
of
the
district
court
to
recall.
now,
was
the
district
court
--
was
the
district
court
bound
to
consider
equities
inuring
to
the
appellate,
solely
by
virtue
of
the
disruption
of
the
status
quo?
that
question
is
also
presented
in
its
proper
focus.
now,
your
honor,
this
is
the
chronology
of
events
which
preceded
the
disruption
of
the
status
quo.
this
is
what
happened.
on
june
2nd,
1955,
the
appellees
filed
a
petition
for
reconsideration
of
division
4's
order
approving
the
preferred
stock
plan.
it
requested
the
full
commission
to
stay
in
adverse
order
if
it
made
one
for
a
reasonable
time
so
that
we
could
go
to
the
district
court
and
get
an
injunction.
on
june
6th,
1955,
we
commenced
this
action.
and
a
few
days
later,
on
june
15th,
1955,
we
moved
for
a
preliminary
injunction,
returned
it
on
june
23rd.
we
didn't
ask
for
any
temporary
restraining
order,
because
we
considered
it
inconceivable
that
alleghany
would
be
advised
to
issue
its
stock,
while
our
motion
for
a
preliminary
injunction
was
sub
iudice.
on
june
21st,
alleghany's
counsel
moved
for
leave
to
intervene.
and
in
their
papers,
they
admit
notice
of
our
application
for
a
temporary
injunction,
although
the
papers
had
not
been
served
upon
because
they
were
not
then
in
the
case,
the
defendants
being
merely
the
united
states
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission
(inaudible).
on
this
--
on
the
same
day,
contrary
to
what
has
been
suggested
here,
the
government
and
the
i.c.c.
joined
in
an
application
to
the
district
court
to
adjoin
the
motion
for
a
temporary
injunctions
until
june
30th,
but
no
one
told
the
district
court
that
on
the
following
day
an
order
would
come
down
from
the
interstate
commerce
commission
which
would
permit
alleghany,
if
it
so
desire,
to
issue
the
stock,
because
there
was
then
no
temporary
restraining
order.
and
on
the
following
day
within
less
than
20
hours
after
the
application
for
the
adjournment
was
made
to
the
district
court,
the
order
did
come
down.
and
that
order
reached
the
possession
of
the
alleghany's
counsel
on
--
at
--
in
washington
on
noon
of
june
23rd.
at
4:30
that
afternoon,
i
was
telephoned
by
alleghany's
counsel
and
told
that
the
full
commission
had
approved
this
preferred
stock
plan
and
that
the
issuance
and
distribution
of
the
stock
was
actually
under
way.
in
less
than
an
hour,
i
prepared
an
application
for
a
temporary
restraining
order.
i
submitted
it
to
judge
dimock
and
at
5:55
that
evening,
he
signed
it
and
it
brought
to
a
halt
the
further
issuance
and
distribution
of
these
securities,
leaving
876,000
shares,
distributed
to
the
extent
that
they
were
in
the
hands
of
the
original,
old
preferred
stockholders
and
that
is
a
crucially
important
distinction.
468,000
were
left
undistributed
and
the
persons
entitled
to
those
merely
held
receipts
for
their
old
securities,
which
--
but
for
the
temporary
restraining
order,
they
could
have
presented
and
claimed
their
new
securities.
so
that
the
result
of
the
temporary
restraining
order
was
to
leave
these
securities
frozen
through,
but
frozen
in
the
hands
of
the
original
holdings.
and
they
never
reached
the
stream
of
commerce
and
they
never
went
to
a
single
person
who
could
truthfully
say
that
he
was
without
notice
of
the
infirmities
in
the
commission's
jurisdiction
and
i
shall
develop
that
point
in
just
a
moment.
now,
in
this
manner,
your
honors,
alleghany
deliberately
disrupted
the
status
quo.
it
could
have
waited
for
six
or
seven
days,
until
there
was
an
argument
on
this
motion
for
a
temporary
injunction
on
the
merits.
it
could
have
urged
all
its
grounds
for
opposition
at
that
time,
but
not
--
notwithstanding,
it
elected
despite
the
pendency
of
the
motion
to
go
forward
and
to
create
this
(inaudible)
common
plea
from
which
we
have
these
anguished
cries
of
innocence
made
here
in
the
argument.
now,
when
questioned
by
the
district
court
on
the
following
day
when
a
motion
to
vacate
the
temporary
restraining
order
was
made
as
to
why
the
order
couldn't
be
relaxed
in
such
a
way
so
as
to
give
those
new
preferred
stockholders
an
opportunity
to
exchange
their
securities
and
get
back
the
ones
that
they
had
given
up,
which
were
valid
securities
and
were
being
traded
on
the
market
and
which
they
could
turn
into
cash
if
they
wanted
to
sell
them,
alleghany
counsel
said,
i
quote
him.
“but
the
thing
having
gone
forward,
we
cannot
unscramble
it.”
and
counsel
for
gruss
&
company
then
later
took
a
similar
position.
there
never
was
--
there
never
was
a
disassociation
by
the
preferred
stockholders
from
that
position.
now,
getting
to
the
question
of
the
innocence
of
these
preferred
stockholders,
because
that
nub
of
the
question
insofar
as
the
equities
are
concerned
assuming
that
they
are
entitled
to
raise
any
questions
of
equity.
the
preferred
stockholders
say
they're
innocent
and
alleghany
as
judge
dimock
found
attempts
to
hide
behind
them,
because
if
the
preferred
stockholders
present
--
prevail
the
alleghany
position
is
rectified
and
they
can
get
the
benefit
of
any
relief
that
is
given
to
the
preferred
stockholders.
these
preferred
stockholders
are
not
naïve,
are
not
innocent
in
the
sense
of
--
we
use
that
word
as
far
as
naïve
or
ordinary
civilian
traders
in
the
stock
market.
they
are
hardcore.
they
are
referred
to
as
hardcore,
recalcitrant
preferred
stockholders
who
have
resisted
in
the
past
every
(inaudible)
to
persuade
them
to
exchange
their
securities
when
prior
conversion
plans
were
made.
this
is
found
by
the
sec
in
the
hearings
before
it.
and
the
ones,
the
preferred
stockholders
before
the
court
are
the
professionals.
i
don't
mean
that
in
an
invidious
sense.
i
merely
say
that
they
are
sophisticated
persons
who
had
full
knowledge
of
the
situation.
they
are
stock
exchange
brokers,
and
traders.
they
knew
on
february
10th,
when
this
preferred
stock
plan
was
published
that
they
had
in
their
pockets,
those
of
them
who
bought
their
securities,
just
before
the
plan
was
approved
by
the
alleghany
directors,
a
profit
of
$170.000
a
share
at
a
--
at
a
maximum
cost
to
them
of
$178
a
share.
in
other
words,
it
was
then
$170
profit
developed
in
the
six
months
period
that
transpired
between
the
alleghany
approval
of
the
preferred
stock
plan
and
the
day
that
the
i.c.c.
finally
approved
it.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
from
$170
per
share
to
$348
per
share.
the
maximum
legal
claim
on
the
preferred
stock
was
$237
per
share,
even
if,
you'll
ignore
the
fact
that
the
preferred
stock
was
selling
marketwise
at
a
discounted
price.
but
if
you
gave
it
every
dollar
that
it
could
legally
command
on
--
on
--
it
was
entitled
to
no
more
than
$237.00.
that
is
the
stated
value,
the
stated
par
value
plus
accumulated
array
--
arrears.
now,
the
alleghany
--
the
preferred
stockholders
knew
that
there
was
as
a
--
a
precondition
to
the
effectiveness
of
the
i.c.c.approved
preferred
stock
plan.
they
had
notice
of
attacks
on
the
i.c.c.
jurisdiction
and
they
had
it
in
this
way.
when
they
became
parties,
contractual
parties
to
the
preferred
stock
plan,
they
signed
a
letter
of
transmittal
in
which
it
affirmatively
appeared
on
the
face
of
the
letter
that
they
were
assuming
all
of
the
obligations
and
conditions
of
the
--
of
the
exchange
offer
and
from
which,
it
appeared
that
they
were
bound
by
the
terms
and
provision
of
that
offer.
they
were
less
contractually
integrated
into
the
plan
and
they
thus
had
notice
of
whatever
infirmities
existed
in
the
plan.
it
matters
not
whether
they
made
their
investigation,
having
noticed
--
having
noticed,
coupled
with
an
interest.
they
had
a
duty
as
prudent
men
to
inquire
and
if
they
failed
to
make
the
inquiry,
they
were
charged
with
whatever
they
might
have
learned,
had
they
made
it.
and
had
they
made
the
inquiry,
they
would
have
discovered
two
things.
the
jurisdiction
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
was
being
attacked
by
the
appellees
and
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
now,
they
say
the
--
we
never
got
a
valid
order
from
the
i.c.c.
we
didn't
make
the
investigation,
so
we
preferred
to
call
ourselves
innocent.”
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
the
sec
filed
a
memorandum
on
september
14th,
1954,
long,
long
before
and
in
connection
with
that
--
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
a
memorandum
in
the
i.c.c.
jurisdiction
proceeding
and
--
and
in
addition
to
that
fact
of
which
the
newspapers
took
public
notice
and
we've
indicated
in
our
brief
where
that
notice
could
have
been
found
--
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
all
right,
i'll
have
it
for
you
in
a
moment.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
page
--
record
190.
now,
this
is
the
singular
fact
about
what
the
preferred
stockholders
didn't
do.
for
four
months
after
the
preferred
stock
plan
was
published,
they
could
have
withdrawn
their
securities
and
gotten
there
money
back
in
effect
or
gotten
their
securities
back,
because
it
was
not
until
june
6th,
1955
that
the
preferred
stock
offer
became
irrevocable.
it
was
not
until
then
that
they
lost
their
chance
to
exchange
their
securities.
and
now,
they
say
having
waged
in
on
the
result,
having
lost
the
wager,
we
come
here
pretending
our
innocence.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
yes,
but
there
was
possibility
of
success.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
yes,
that's
all
they
asked,
your
honor.
that's
quite
correct.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
no,
i
--
i
think
not,
sir.
what
they
actually
did
was
to
make
an
--
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
as
i
read
it,
sir.
they
asked
has
the
i.c.c.to
decline
jurisdiction
as
a
matter
of
discretion
and
to
surrender
to
it
them.
they
said
that
the
--
that
nothing
in
the
preexisting
history
of
the
i.c.c.
regulation
of
alleghany
including
the
1945
orders
required
the
i.c.c.
to
continue
its
regulation
of
alleghany.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
oh,
yes
and
that
was
the
--
the
very
place
where
we
diverged
from
the
position
of
the
sec.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
we
said
that
the
i.c.c.
had
no
power
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
right.
thank
you,
sir.
now,
the
preferred
stockholders
in
addition
say
that
this
hardship
falls
on
them,
as
i
pointed
out.
they
had
an
opportunity
to
acquiesce
any
suggestions
made
by
district
court
that
the
injunction
should
--
could
be
relaxed.
and
i
myself
offered
to
put
myself
at
the
disposal
of
counsel
to
try
to
workout
such
a
relaxation.
we
were
only
interested
in
attacking
the
jurisdiction
of
the
i.c.c.
we
sought
to
impose
no
hardship
on
any
security
holdings.
we
wanted
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
common
stock,
that's
true.
but
we
were
perfectly
willing
to
acquiesce
in
relaxation
of
the
judgment,
which
might
have
permitted
them
to
get
their
securities
back.
they
said,
nothing
doing.
it's
all
or
nothing.
and
that's
where
they
stand
to
this
very
moment.
excuse
me.
now,
your
honors,
they
--
the
government
has
said
that
injunction
should
not
be
vacated.
or
i'm
sorry.
the
injunction
should
be
vacated
because
they
say
it's
no
longer
necessary.
they
say,
the
sec
having
made
its
pronouncement
upon
this
stock
plan
the
criminal
sanctions
are
sufficient
to
act
to
as
a
deterrent
and
no
one
needs
the
injunction
anymore.
my
best
answer
to
that
observation
is
to
quote
from
what
alleghany's
counsel
said
on
the
final
hearing
before
the
district
court.
i
quote
him.
“accordingly,
in
the
interest
of
complete
candor,
we
wish
to
advice
the
court
that
the
exchange
agent
would
probably
deliver
the
remaining
400,000
shares
to
its
principals,
unless
this
court
were
specifically
to
enjoin
further
deliverance
of
the
securities.”
that
was
quite
an
extraordinary
and
candid
statement.
may
i
ask
this
court,
what
else
could
the
district
court
have
done
faced
with
a
threat
from
alleghany's
counsel,
that
unless
it
acted,
alleghany
would
move
forward
and
put
the
securities
out,
even
though
there
had
been
a
temporary
restraining
order,
a
preliminary
injunction
and
the
district
court
was
about
to
hand
down
its
judgment
affirming
the
views
of
the
court
--
of
the
district
court
thus
far.
we
say
that
the
injunction
is
needed
to
preserve
the
status
quo
and
we
urge
to
this
court
to
protect
the
common
stockholders
and
indeed
alleghany
corporation
itself
from
the
consequences
of
lifting
the
injunction,
because
the
chaos
involving
the
multiplicity
of
suits
which
would
result,
if
this
--
these
securities
should
go
forward
into
the
stream
of
commerce
would
hurt
everyone.
we
say
to
your
honors
that
affirmance
of
the
judgment
below
will
expedite
relief
for
the
preferred
stockholders.
the
district
court
in
its
judgment
reserved
to
us
the
right
to
apply
--
reserved
to
us,
not
to
the
appellants
the
right
to
apply
to
the
district
court
for
an
adjustment
of
the
equities.
and
under
the
--
under
the
--
the
holdings
that
began
with
porter
against
warner
in
other
cases,
the
district
court
has
jurisdiction
to
restore
the
status
quo
ante
even
it
means
bringing
in
before
the
court
persons
who
were
not
originally
parties
to
it,
such
as
non-intervening
preferred
stockholders,
who
might
want
to
be
heard
when
it
came
time
to
adjust
the
equities.
we
--
we
say
that
if
this
court
affirms
the
judgment
and
retains
the
injunction,
we
will
make
this
application
to
the
district
court
promptly.
now,
your
honors,
if
--
if
we're
right
on
the
proposition
turning
now
to
the
substantive
question
of
control
by
alleghany
of
the
new
york
central
railroad
system
of
73
companies,
if
we're
right
on
the
proposition
that
alleghany
does
not
control
central,
this
court
need
not
reach
any
other
issue
in
the
case,
for
everyone
agrees
that
if
alleghany
did
control
central,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
had
no
jurisdiction.
and
the
orders
must
fall
and
the
judgment
must
be
affirmed.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
it
found
control
to
have
existed
as
a
matter
of
fact
on
may
26th,
1954
by
virtue
of
the
proxy
contest.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
yes,
sir,
it
does.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
the
i.c.c.
so
held.
now
--
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
i
say
alleghany
--
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
--
i
say
that
alleghany
admits
it
in
its
brief
and
says
that
it
would
not
require
to
make
a
control
application
if
it
had
control
of
central
and
that
is
the
basis
on
which
the
i.c.c.
states
its
position.
i
believe
that's
a
fair
statement.
now,
one
other
aspect
before
discussing
the
substantive
question
in
contrast
to
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
or
rather
in
contrast
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
held
full
and
fair
hearings
on
the
preferred
stock
plan.
and
after
a
full
and
fair
hearing
in
which
it
examined
all
of
the
tendered
witnesses,
including
robert
r.
young,
it
found
the
plan
potentially
deceptive.
those
were
its
words,
grossly
unfair,
we
say
to
the
common
stock
and
not
consistent
with
the
protection
of
investors
and
not
necessary
or
appropriate
in
the
public
interest.
the
--
it
was
the
sec
who
disclosed
that
alleghany
had
the
intention
of
paying
this
very
substantial
premium
to
its
preferred
stockholders
by
giving
them
the
right
to
exercise
an
option
to
convert
their
holdings
into
common
stock,
a
premium
which
we
calculate
on
the
basis
of
the
sec
findings
to
have
amount
to
fifteen
millions
of
dollars.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
there
were
two
--
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
yes,
there
were
two
actions
of
--
two
aspects
of
it.
the
sec
findings
were
relevant
because
it
indicated
the
extent
of
adversity
of
our
position
with
alleghany
and
demonstrated
our
standing
to
sue.
it
also
indicated
what
the
i.c.c.
might
have
found,
had
it
made
a
proper
investigation,
had
it
granted
us
a
--
a
hearing
and
had
it
--
it
examined
the
alleghany
records
which
i'm
going
to
refer
to
in
just
a
moment
and
lay
the
demonstration
that
the
--
that
the
plan
was
unfair
as
a
matter
of
fact.
so,
in
those
two
respects
that
sec
decision
are
directly
relevant.
now,
we
had
called
these
facts,
namely
the
arithmetical
basis
of
the
unfairness
of
the
plan
to
the
attention
of
the
--
of
the
i.c.c.,
but
the
i.c.c.
ignored
those
facts.
and
it
ignored
us
and
gave
no
hearing
and
i'm
--
i'm
merely
demonstrating
that
what
the
sec
did
in
the
exercise
of
its
informed
judgment
and
its
expertise
was
to
make
the
kind
of
inquiry
that
the
i.c.c.
could
have
made
and
should
have
made
and
which
would
have
produced
the
same
findings,
i
submit,
had
it
been
made.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
that
may
be
so,
your
honor.
we
never
reached
that
question
as
far
as
the
present
posture
of
the
litigation
is
concerned
because
the
district
court
didn't
pass
on
the
fairness
of
the
plan.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
--
i
accept
to
consider
it
in
the
-
in
the
light
of
the
aspects
of
the
case
which
i've
indicated
to,
your
honor.
now,
in
the
reply
briefs
of
the
appellants,
they
claim
that
the
sec
didn't
find
that
this
preferred
stock
plan
was
grossly
unfair
to
the
common
stock.
they
say
in
effect
we
took
it
from
--
we
took
that
statement
from
a
record
not
in
--
not
before
the
court.
may
i,
in
view
of
the
statement,
may
i
briefly
read
from
the
sec
brief
at
pages
52
and
57,
very
short
excerpts
of
the
--
of
the
sec
holding.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
i
mean
--
yes,
the
sec
brief.
well
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
--
is
that
portion
of
the
sec
brief,
page
52,
that
portion
of
the
brief
which
contains
the
opinion
of
the
full
commission.
i
read
it
at
the
top
of
the
page.
“on
the
basis
of
the
various
conversion
hypothesis,
set
forth
above,
but
excluding
any
assumed
exercise
of
the
perpetual
warrants,
the
47
shares
of
common
stock
obtainable
on
conversion
of
the
new
preferred
stock
received
under
the
exchange
offer
would
have
a
net
asset
value
ranging
from
approximately
$217
to
$413,
depending
upon
the
extent
of
the
conversions
assumed.”
the
next
appropriate
reference
is
at
page
57
where
the
commission
is
discussing
the
testimony
of
mr.
lance
who
was
tended
by
alleghany
as
an
expert.
lance
expressed
the
view
that
alleghany's
common
stock
would
continue
to
sell
at
a
premium
over
its
asset
value,
as
it
had
at
times
in
the
past
so
long
as
that
asset
value
was
increasing,
and
that
alleghany's
common
stock
might
be
expected
to
increase
to
approximately
to
$12.55
figure
after
final
consummation.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
well,
this
is
on
the
same
record.
in
fact,
that
is
true,
your
honor.
it
is
--
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
--
on
the
same
--
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
yes
sir.
just
--
may
i
finish
the
sentence?
on
--
on
that
basis,
the
common
stock
into
which
each
share
of
old
preferred
stock
would
be
ultimately
convertible
would
be
in
excess
of
$400,
an
amount
which
is
considerably
above
the
$270
figure
that
lance
recognized
as
being
high
in
terms
of
fairness
to
the
existing
common
stockholders.
in
our
opinion,
this
would
appear
to
produce
a
grossly
unfair
result.
and
all
of
these
facts,
your
honor,
were
in
the
record
before
the
i.c.c.
the
point
of
the
matter
is
that
every
one
of
the
facts
upon
which
the
sec
acted
were
called
in
as
ultimate
facts,
as
allegations
in
our
pleadings
to
the
attention
of
the

evoked
no
comment
and
produced
no
hearing.
now
--
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
which
we
--
we
got
intervention
on
the
day
that
they
decided
the
case
against
us
and
--
and
denied
us
a
hearing.
if
that
mean
--
if
that
means
we
were
before
it
to
the
extent,
we
were.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
long
before
that.
we
--
we
came
in
four
months
before
with
this
sixth
(inaudible)
--
a
number
of
pleadings,
a
number
of
applications
for
leave
to
intervene.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
they
granted
it
on
the
day
they
decided
the
case
against
us
and
--
and
we
got
notice
on
the
following
day.
we
actually
found
out
that
we've
been
allowed
intervention
after
the
preferred
--
after
the
--
after
the
order
was
signed
and
made.
they
had
made
a
determination
i
may
say
a
month
before
that
were
to
be
entitled
to
intervention,
but
the
order
never
went
to
us
until
the
day
after
they
made
a
decision,
a
month
later,
finding
against
us
on
the
merits.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
they
made
an
order
granting
intervention
and
denying
our
request
for
a
hearing
and
in
the
same
breath,
disposing
of
the
proceeding
on
the
merits.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
they
made
a
formal
order.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
we
didn't
get
the
order
until
after
they
--
a
month
later
until
they
decided
the
case.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
well,
they
never
--
they
never
sent
the
order
in
the
mail.
as
far
as
i
know,
we
--
we
got
it
only
after
inquiring
about
it.
we
never
got
personal
notice
of
that
order
except
in
a
decision
which
finally
a
month
later
said
that
there
had
been
such
an
order.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
well,
it
bears
on
the
question
whether
we
got
a
fair
hearing
and
i
haven't
yet
reached
that
question.
now,
it's
been
said
that
--
that
when
we
said
that
mr.
young
and
mr.
kirby
made
a
profit
of
a
$4,800,000
as
a
result
of
this
preferred
stock
issued
and
that
profit
personal
that
those
facts
are
not
in
the
record.
may
i
make
a
very
brief
demonstration
that
they
offer?
alleghany
supplied
these
facts
and
the
i.c.c.
elucidated
them
to
some
extent
in
its
report.
and
from
those
reports,
record
306,
record
309,
record
522,
it
appears
that
the
range
of
this
preferred
stock
was
two
and
three-eights
to
$170
over
a
period
20
years
and
the
$170
price
was
reached
on
--
on
the
eve
of
approval
by
the
alleghany
directors
of
the
preferred
stock
plan.
now,
during
this
--
during
the
period
that
immediately
preceded
the
alleghany
director's
approval
of
the
plan,
young
and
kirby
accumulated
20%
of
these
securities
for
themselves.
that's
at
record
309,
and
522.
that
amounted
to
$27,784
shares.
we're
doing
the
same
period
that
mr.
young
doubled
his
personal
holdings
and
that
was
a
finding
in
--
in
breswick
against
bridge.
now,
all
of
this
accumulation
occurred
during
the
period
leading
up
to
corporate
action
taken
by
alleghany
to
put
out
the
exchange
offered.
on
june
15th,
1955,
seven
days
before
the
i.c.c.
approved
the
plan,
the
market
had
risen
on
a
when-issued
basis,
the
market
on
the
old
securities
had
--
had
had
risen
on
a
--
from
$170
of
share
to
$348.75
a
share.
that
appears
in
the
sec
brief
of
page
55.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that's
the
preferred
stock.
so
that
the
minimum
profit,
assuming
that
young
and
kirby
bought
their
stock
at
$170
a
share,
the
highest
prize
we
actually
--
they
must
have
bought
it
at
a
lower
price,
but
giving
them
the
benefit
of
a
doubt
in
saying
that
they
bought
it
$170
a
share,
the
minimum
profit
was
$178
a
share
and
a
$178
times
27,784
is
$4,943,000.
so
that
actually,
we
understated
the
profit
by
$143,000.
now,
i
turn
to
the
subsequent
question
of
whether
alleghany
does
in
fact
control
central.
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
by
its
findings
and
they're
the
only
findings
of
control
in
this
case,
found
that
alleghany
acquired
control
of
central
on
may
26th,
1954
as
a
result
of
a
proxy
contest
in
connection
with
the
new
york
central
proxy
campaign
of
1955
or
1954,
i
beg
pardon.
the
same
findings
do
not
disclose
that
on
that
very
same
control
date,
may
26,
1954,
there
was
6,000,446,000
shares
of
new
york
central
stock
outstanding
that
young,
kirby
and
richardson,
their
associates,
personally
owned
a
million
shares
of
new
york
central
stock
at
that
time.
and
that
the
total
value
of
alleghany's
holdings
which
were
limited
to
11,400
shares
was
only
$270,000
whereas
the
total
value
of
the
four
individual
holdings
in
central
was
$23,000,000.
we
say
that
the
i.c.c.
control
findings
were
insufficient,
that
they
were
unsupported.
division
4
held
to
that
effect
and
the
district
court
so
found.
but,
your
honors,
if
there
be
any
question
about
whether
there
--
or
not,
there
was
control
by
alleghany
of
new
york
central
on
may
26,
1954,
this
crucial
event
which
preceded
it
will
dispel
that
doubt.
on
january
19th,
1954,
the
day
that
alleghany
divested
itself
of
control
of
the
chesapeake
and
ohio
railroad
system,
in
order
to
prepare
the
way
for
its
--
for
young
and
kirby's
attempt
to
take
control
of
new
york
central
the
minutes
of
the
board
meeting
held
that
day
contained
the
following
statement.
this
was
an
--
a
statement
made
after
a
recommendation
that
alleghany
divest
itself
of
control
of
the
c
&
o.
i
quote
“the
chairman,
mr.
young,
stated
his
personal
opinion
that
substantial
investment
by
this
corporation,
alleghany
in
central
at
this
time
was
not
wise,
because
it
was
not
clear
whether
control
could
be
obtained
and
because
control
could
perhaps
be
more
easily
secured
by
individuals
than
by
a
corporation.”
now,
i
must
admit
that
169
--
once
--
that
that's
found
at
record
179,
i
must
admit
that
that
record
of
fact
was
not
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
during
the
pendency
of
the
administrative
proceedings.
it
was
brought
out
at
the
final
hearing
before
the
district
court
in
opposition
to
a
motion
by
alleghany
for
a
new
trial,
but
it
does
pose
this
question
and
that
is,
what
kind
of
investigation
did
the
i.c.c.
make?
it
had
alleghany's
records
at
its
disposal
and
it
is
unthinkable
that
having
made
any
kind
of
investigation,
if
it
did,
that
it
would
have
stopped
short
of
taking
a
look
at
the
minutes
of
the
meeting
of
the
--
of
directors
that
which
alleghany
divested
itself
of
control
of
the
chesapeake
&
ohio
railroad
system.
and
it
would
have
observed,
had
it
made
that
inquiry
that
the
directors
themselves
were
saying
to
mr.
young
and
mr.
kirby,
“go
your
own
way.
take
control
in
your
own
names,
but
it
is
not
propitious
for
us
to
do
so.”
there
is
no
corporate
minute
or
corporate
record
of
any
kind
in
this
record,
showing
that
the
directors
contemplated
that
alleghany
would
attempt
to
take
control
of
new
york
central.
and
there
is
no
authority
that
we
know
of,
corporate-wise
for
any
such
attempt.
now,
instead
of
--
it's
resting
on
record
facts
the
i.c.c.
rested
its
findings
on
alleghany's
application,
solely
on
alleghany's
application
and
the
i.c.c.
brief
so
discloses.
and
the
alleghany's
application
was
signed
by
its
public
relations
officer,
mr.
(inaudible).
mr.
kirby
and
mr.
young
would
not
lend
their
names
to
that
application.
now,
the
fact
is
that
new
york
central
directors
were
not
chosen
by
alleghany.
the
i.c.c.
found
that
they
were.
reading
from
the
new
york
central
proxy
statement
signed
by
mr.
young
on
half
of
quote,
“alleghany,
young,
kirby
ownership
board,”
a
--
a
device
to
make
it
appear
that
alleghany
was
actually
seeking
control
when
its
corporate
record
indicated
to
the
contrary.
this
is
what
the
proxy
statement
said,
“if
alleghany
will
furnish
a
clearing
house
and
clerical
headquarters
and
advance
the
interim
costs
of
our
solicitation
for
which
it
will
be
proportionately
reimbursed
by
our
nominees.”
that
was
to
give
coloration
for
the
application
which
alleghany
intended
to
make
on
september
20,
1954
and
which
is
to
provide
the
basis
if
any
exists,
for
i.c.c.'s
jurisdiction.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
i
was
reading
from
the
proxy
statement
which
was
put
--
signed
by
mr.
young
which
was
put
out
at
the
time
the
--
the
new
york
central
proxy
campaign
was
under
way.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
well,
that
statement
was
called
to
the
i.c.c.'s
attention.
we
called
it
to
their
attention.
we
--
we
gave
the
entire
proxy
statement
and
many
other
relevant
facts
among
--
included
among
those
which
i've
called
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
there
is
no
reference
in
the
report
to
that
proxy
statement
or
to
that
fact,
although
it
was
there
in
--
in
text
for
the
i.c.c.
to
observe.
now,
of
the
15
directors
who
were
elected
on
may
26,
1955,
that
is
the
15
directors
of
new
york
central
railroad,
three
of
them,
only
three
of
them
were
officers
or
directors
of
alleghany.
the
other
12
had
no
connection
with
alleghany.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
we
were
discussing
the
effect
of
the
election
of
directors
of
the
new
york
central
railroad
on
may
26,
1955
or
rather
may
26,
1954
which
was
the
control
date
found
by
the
icc.
and
i
pointed
out
that
of
the
15
directors
who
were
elected
on
that
day,
only
three
of
them
were
officers
or
directors
of
alleghany.
and
the
other
12
were
--
as
the
proxy
statement
which
is
in
the
record
clearly
indicates
were
independent
businessman,
each
having
their
own
business
or
profession,
separate
and
distinct
from
that
of
alleghany.
the
12
men
included
collectively
these
12
individuals
who
had
no
connection
with
alleghany,
collectively
held
80%
of
the
board's
voting
power
of
new
york
central.
and
there
is
no
claim
in
this
case,
none
in
this
record,
that
a
single
one
of
these
12
were
agents
of
alleghany
under
it's
domination
of
control
or
behold
into
it
in
any
way.
although,
we
say
that
in
effect
on
may
26,
1954,
which
was
the
date
as
of
which
the
icc
findings
spoke.
the
stock
control
of
central
was
vested
in
young,
kirby,
murchison
and
richardson
individually,
they
had
a
million
shares
on
that
day
and
alleghany
had
11,400
shares.
and
80%
of
the
directors
who
controlled
15%
of
the
new
york
central
stock,
having
no
relation
to
alleghany,
the
icc
control
findings
on
the
record
was
without
support.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
no,
no.
that's
merely
a
--
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
i
have
no
doubts,
sir.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
i
have
no
doubt.
he
--
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
oh,
yes,
it
does
because
--
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
--
because
if
young
controlled
alleghany,
he
had
the
power
to
exercise
control
and
that's
one
of
the
standards
under
the
act
by
which
the
question
of
control
must
be
determined.
this
act
--
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
not
necessarily,
but
the
realities
of
the
situation
must
determine
the
realities
of
the
corporate
situation.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
not
necessarily,
but
the
least
that
must
be
said
through
our
position
is
that
young
and
kirby
were
parties,
necessary
parties
to
the
control
--
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
well,
it
was
--
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
well,
we
say
that
if
--
if
the
realities
are
measured,
it
was
young
and
kirby
in
their
own
right,
associated
with
their
texas
associates,
murchison
and
richardson,
who
had
the
power
to
control
and
we
say
--
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it
--
that
is
always
true
--
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
no,
but
as
i
understand
that
the
--
the
attorney
for
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
admitted
that
under
the
holding
of
one
case,
if
the
individuals
were
controlling
parties,
they
were
necessary
parties.
they
weren't
made
parties
here,
they
didn't
join
them.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
yes,
that
is.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
no,
sir,
it
does
not.
the
only
record
--
the
only
thing
that
it
does
show
is
the
corporate
document
that
i
referred
to,
which
shows
that
alleghany
didn't
intend
to
take
control
in
its
--
in
corporate
wise
and
ask
the
individuals
to
take
control
personally,
and
that
maybe
another
answer
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question.
here,
the
realities
were
that
the
corporation
said,
“we
don't
want
to
take
control,
you
individuals
take
it,
it
best
suits
that
the
purposes
of
all
concerned
of
the
individuals
there.”
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
oh,
this
was
--
this
was
the
private
corporate
records
of
alleghany,
not
communicated
to
anyone
until
after
the
icc
proceedings
had
been
--
had
been
concluded,
that
fact
wasn't
made
public
until
the
day
of
final
hearing
in
this
case.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
speaks
for
itself.
i
think
it
says
in
so
many
words
we're
not
seeking
control
now.
and
may
i
say,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
at
no
time
between
the
date
of
that
resolution
in
may
26,
1954,
which
is
the
control
date
on
which
the
icc
findings
predicated,
did
the
factual
or
statistical
situation
change.
the
same
stockholdings
existed,
only
--
only
became
to
a
greater
extent
vested
in
the
individuals
during
the
intervening
period.
so
if
at
this
time
has
any
significance,
it
has
no
significance
for
the
purposes
of
this
case.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
now,
the
best
answer
i
can
make
to
that
question
is
that
in
the
derivative
action,
they
took
the
position
with
the
profits
on
their
own
million
shares
belonged
to
them.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
i
think
not,
sir,
because
young
and
kirby
have
been
--
young
and
kirby
have
been
found
by
icc
decision
in
1948
to
be
in
control
of
alleghany.
when
the
board
spoke,
it
spoke
for
young
and
kirby,
they
were
--
they
were
mr.
--
mr.
's
alleghany,
and
it
was
their
thinking
that
produced
these
men.
and
we
think
that
the
finding
of
the
commission
in
1948
on
control
of
--
by
the
individuals
of
alleghany
is
controlling
here
because
no
one
has
disputed
the
fact.
it
remains
uncontroverted
for
all
purposes
in
this
case.
now,
your
honors
--
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
as
far
as
i
know,
when
i
had
forth
the
representation
made
in
the
icc
brief,
the
only
process
it
went
through
was
to
read
the
pleadings
of
alleghany
and
to
adopt
its
findings.
and
that
was
made,
as
i
said,
by
the
public
--
that
pleading
was
verified
by
the
public
relations
officer
of
alleghany.
it
wasn't
verified
by
young
or
kirby.
and
although,
we
requested
hearings
on
all
these
crucial
questions,
we
never
got
them.
they
made
no
investigation
based
either,
as
far
as
we
can
determine,
either
an
ex
parte
investigation.
so
far
as
this
record
shows,
there
is
no
such
indication,
and
as
far
as
the
hearing
question
is
concerned,
its
--
it
shows
very
clearly
that
we
were
not
free
and
that
the
issues
were
not
inquired
into
in
an
evidentiary
sense.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
what
particularly?
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
you
mean
the
recognition
by
the
commission?
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
in
the
scc
--
that's
in
the
scc
brief
--
or
the
icc
brief
rather,
and
i'll
have
that
footnote
for
you
in
just
a
moment.
there
is
a
reference
to
it.
i'll
give
that
to
you
in
just
a
moment,
mr.
justice
reed.
it's

12.
now,
your
honors,
during
the
period
that
followed,
may
26,
1954,
the
date
on
which
the
annual
meeting
of
new
york
central
railroad
was
held,
alleghany
made
no
application
to
clarify
its
status.
it
is
complained
here
of
confusion
and
chaos
resulting
from
what's
happened
in
this
case,
but
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
it
had
for
nine
months
an
opportunity
to
clarify
its
own
status
and
didn't
seek
to
take
advantage
of
it.
it
wasn't
until
the
icc
and
the
scc
both
moved
in
june,
july
of
1954
to
terminate
the
1945
orders.
we
say
that
the
alleghany
principals,
young
and
kirby,
were
apprehensive
or
became
apprehensive
that
there
might
then
be
a
full
disclosure
of
the
situation
with
--
regarding
to
the
new
york
central,
the
circumstances
of
the
proxy
fight
and
they
then
tried
to
buttress
their
position
by
acquiring
300,000
shares
of
stock
and
the
voting
rights
to
an
additional
300,000
shares.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
i
would
--
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
and
the
district
court
so
found.
it
is
--
it
is
true
that
--
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
oh,
yes,
sir.
we
did
so
and
the
district
court
found
on
that
very
point
that
we
had
said
so
and
pointed
out
to
the
pleading.
the
particular
pleading
was
the
pleading
of
february
18
at
record
394,
we
denied
control
in
so
many
words
and
the
district
court
found
that
we
had
denied
control
in
so
many
words.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
and
we
--
394
and
we
consistently
denied
control
for
four
months
thereafter
in
every
pleading
that
we
tendered
to
the
commission.
it
--
they
rely
on
the
first
pleading
that
we
made
in
this
case
and
we
amended
our
pleadings
and
made
our
position
crystal
clear
for
--
for
three
or
four
months.
now,
your
honors,
finally
--
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
changing
in
one
--
from
the
first
pleading
and
all
--
all
of
these
six
subsequent
pleadings
raised
the
issues
squarely.
we
surely
had
a
right
to
amend
our
pleadings
and
we
did
so.
and
we
confounded
--
we
confound
our
pleadings
to
documentary
evidence
which
came
to
us,
and
which
justified
us
in
making
that
statement,
and
which
was
not
available
to
us
on
the
--
on
the
occasion
of
the
original
pleading.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
we
say
that
there's
no
--
there's
no
substantial
evidence
to
support
it.
we
say
that
if
that
be
so,
your
honors,
may
do
that
as
a
matter
of
law.
your
honors,
after
waiting
nine
months
to
clarify
their
status
doing
that
volitionally
and
without
making
any
--
and
knowing
that
the
--
they
had
divested
themselves
of
control
of
cno
on
january
19,
1954,
and
that
they
were
in
the
netherlands,
so
to
speak,
an
unregistered
investment
company.
they
waited
for
nine
months
to
make
their
application
and
they
finally
filed
it
on
september
20,
1954.
now,
in
that
application,
curiously
enough,
they'd
invest
for
interstate
commerce
commission
approval
of
the
control
of
the
new
york
central
system.
in
fact,
they
quite
candidly
say
in
their
briefs
and
here,
and
said
it
then,
that
they
don't
have
to
make
such
an
application.
on
the
other
hand,
what
they
did
do
is
they
claimed
that
they
already
had
control
of
the
new
york
central
system
with
its
73
companies,
most
of
which
are
carriers.
and
they
merely
asked
for
the
approval
of
the
merger,
of
let
us
say
the
73rd
company
with
the
72nd,
claiming
that
that
excused
the
necessity
for
applying
for
approval
of
all
73.
and
we
say
that
--
that
our
proposition
is
illogical
and
fallacious
upon
its
phase
and
we
say
it
was
a
wholly
and
consistent
position
for
them
to
take
and
that
is
precisely
what
division
4
for
so
held
at
record
426.
so
strange
was
this
merger
application,
so
curiously
worded
was
it
that
it
evoked
from
judge
dimock
this
observation,
“the
prayer
for
the
approval
of
the
merger
is
treated
as
if
it
were
an
effective
but
meaningless
incantation
to
propitiate
a
medicine
man.”
now,
alleghany
argues
that
it's
subsequent
if
it
didn't
have
control
on
may
26,
1954,
its
subsequent
purchases
of
new
york
central
stock
and
it's
acquisition
of
voting
rights
gave
it
a
control
which
it
did
not
previously
had.
the
first
answer
to
the
question
is
that
the
icc
findings
weren't
predicated
on
subsequent
control
--
subsequent
acquisitions.
it
--
they
did
mention
600,000
shares
but
they
found
that
the
control
existed
as
of
may
26,
1954
by
virtue
of
a
proxy
contest,
a
concept
which
is
statically
impossible
in
the
light
of
the
stockholdings
of
the
parties
as
i
have
given
them
to
you.
it
was
young
and
kirby
control
of
alleghany,
we
say,
that
was
crucial
because
the
issue
here
is
not
how
many
shares
of
stock
new
york
central
that
alleghany
owned,
the
issue
is
who
controls
alleghany's
right
to
vote
the
shares
which
alleghany
owned
or
to
exercise
the
voting
rights
which
alleghany
acquired.
and
whether
young
and
kirby
control
of
these
rights,
plus
their
own
central
holdings,
gave
them,
as
distinguished
from
alleghany,
control
of
new
york
central,
gave
them
in
the
language
of
the
statute
the
power
to
exercise
control.
interstate
commerce
commission
dealt,
not
at
all,
with
this
aspect
of
the
case.
alleghany
has
argued
that
under
section
15
(2)
of
the
act,
the
icc
orders
must
be
continued
and
being
continued
in
effect
until
they
are
terminated
by
a
subsequent
order
and
that
the
1945
orders
vesting
control
of
the
chesapeake
and
ohio
railroad
in
alleghany
perpetuated
alleghany's
control,
and
it's
--
perpetuated
its
carrier's
status
through
these
entire
proceedings.
well,
we
say
that
it
was
not
possible,
legally
possible
for
this
to
happen.
the
full
commission
found
that
alleghany
was
in
fact
a
prison,
not
a
carrier
after
january
19th,
1954.
we
say
that
on
that
day,
as
a
result
of
that
finding,
alleghany
became
an
--
an
unregistered
investment
company.
as
such,
it
could
not
acquire
control
of
the
new
york
central
system
validly
without
violating
section
7
of
the
investment
company
act,
which
prohibits
an
unregistered
company
from
acquiring
control
of
any
company
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
and
furthermore,
we
say
that
if
the
1940
scc
registration
was
automatically
revived
by
virtue
of
the
loss
of
the
chesapeake
and
ohio
on
january
19,
1954.
then
in
terms
of
the
investment
company
act,
alleghany
violated
section
18
(d)
of
that
statute
by
issuing
a
security
which
did
not
meet
standards
of
that
section
as
found
by
the
scc
a
few
months
ago.
now,
we
say,
if
the
district
court
and
the
united
states,
and
appellees
are
all
wrong
about
this
proposition,
about
the
continuation
of
the
orders
and
if,
as
alleghany
claims,
that
the
1945
order
continued
and
effect
throughout
1955
or
is
still
in
effect
then
we
say
that
alleghany
violated
the
interstate
commerce
act.
because
under
the
cno
order
of
1945,
they
were
granted
control
of
the
cno
and
given
carrier
status
under
section
5
(3),
only
under
the
stipulation
which
they
voluntarily
made
and
which
is
incorporated
in
the
commissions
order
that
if
they
acquired
any
--
of
the
stock
of
any
carriers,
subsequently
any
carriers
other
than
the
cno,
they
would
have
to
put
them
in
a
voting
trust
so
as
to
insulate
them
against
alleghany
voting
control.
and
we
--
and
we
say
also,
it
violated
that
provision
of
the
--
of
the
1945
order
which
debarred
alleghany
from
having
an
interlocking
--
locking
directorate
with
any
railroad
other
than
the
chesapeake
and
ohio.
and
yet,
the
first
thing
that
young
and
kirby
did
when
they
took
control
of
the
--
of
central
in
may
26,
1954,
was
to
elect
young,
the
chairman
of
the
board.
now,
we
say
therefore,
that
this
argument
of
continuation
and
control
is
sterile
one.
it
has
no
impact
on
this
case
because
no
matter
how
you
view
it,
it's
merely
an
attempt
to
create
a
defense
to
another
case
in
another
court
and
it
has
no
bearing
on
the
issues
of
this
case.
now,
alleghany
argues
that
it
was
never
necessary
for
it
to
make
any
control
application
because
when
it
controlled
the
73
companies,
it
was
only
controlling
one,
73
equals
one
is
the
demonstration
that
they
make
an
effect.
the
legislative
history,
which
i
won't
have
the
time
to
go
into
here
is
set
forth
from
pages
68
to
70
of
--
of
our
brief,
and
at
page
70
we
show
that
as
a
result
of
the
senate
investigation
of
--
of
alleghany
and
other
investment
companies
who
are
holding
securities
and
carriers,
the
congress
determined
to
dispel
any
ambiguity
and
to
close
any
loophole
that
might
have
existed
with
respect
to
this
very
question
and
by
the
enactment
of
the
transportation
act
of
1940
and
the
text
language
which
the
congress
enacted
at
that
time,
if
there
wasn't
an
ambiguity,
there
wasn't
a
loophole,
it
was
closed.
the
text
matter
that
set
forth
in
our
brief
below,
the
quotation
of
the
statute
at
page
70
illustrates
our
point
in
this
regard.
but
division
4
had
no
doubt
about
this,
division
4
had
no
illusions
on
the
subject
of
what
control
of
73
carriers
means
in
terms
of
icc
standards.
but
this
is
what
it
said
in
this
case,
“we
have
long
recognized
under
section
5
that
railroad
systems
are
comprised
of
two
or
more
carriers
and
that
control
of
a
single
system
may
not
lawfully
be
effectuated
without
our
approval
and
authorization."
because
that
principle
is
considered
basic,
almost
as
a
definition,
so
much
so
that
the
question
of
acquisition
of
a
carrier
system
has
never
been
contested
before
the
commission.
and
as
far
as
we
know,
there
have
been
no
court
decisions
touching
on
that
issue.
i
know
the
full
commission
repudiated
that
the
finding
of
the
division
4,
but
we
think
the
full
commission
was
wrong
and
division
4
was
right,
and
the
district
court
agreed
with
the
construction
that
we
placed
upon
it
and
that
division
4
placed
upon
at
this
aspect
of
the
case.
we
say
that
alleghany
itself
acquiesced
in
this
interpretation
in
1945
when
a
proceeding
to
administer
certain
sanctions
to
alleghany
for
a
failure
to
have
made
a
--
application
for
control
of
cno
reached
the
stage
of
a
proposed
examiner's
report
and
--
in
which
examined
the
both
that
time
upheld
this
very
same
construction
of
the
statute
that
we're
now
claiming
for
and
insisted
that
an
application
would
have
to
be
made.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
in
settlement
of
the
--
of
the
potential
sanctions
that
alleghany
was
faced
with
in
the
1945
proceeding
that
the
cn
order
--
cno
order
of
1945
finally
emerged
and
the
cno
order
contains
a
direct
finding
that
alleghany
had
acquired
control
of
the
cno.
at
that
time
it
had
control
of
no
other
carrier
and
yet
the
commission
found
it
necessary
to
incorporate
it
in
its
order
--
in
its
report
in
this
finding.
we
further
find
that
acquisition
by
alleghany
corporation
of
control
through
ownership
of
stock
as
above
described
of
the
chesapeake
and
ohio,
nickel
plate,
pere
marquette
and
their
subsidiaries
and
affiliates
is
a
transaction
within
the
scope
of
section
5
(2)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
that
would
depend
upon,
firstly,
whether
there
was
control
in
fact.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
yes.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
no,
i
think
--
i
think
the
answer
to
your
question
is
in
the
negative,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
because
that
isn't
the
only
necessary
assumption
you
must
make.
in
order
to
produce
an
affirmative
answer
to
your
question,
you
must
assume
that
there's
nothing
to
any
of
the
other
five
--
of
the
other
four
questions
in
this
case
any
--
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
i
see.
well,
if
we
take
that
in
vacuo
and
compartmentalize
it,
i
think
perhaps
your
honor
is
right.
in
any
case
your
honor,
i
may
point
out
that
section
5
(3)
status
does
not
follow
under
the
statute,
unless
there
is
5
(2)
approval
and
there
was
no
5
(2)
approval
here
and
none
was
asked.
and
an
invitation
by
the
commission
and
commission
made
an
invitation
to
alleghany,
invited
them
to
ask
for
approval
of
control
and
they
rejected
it,
and
declined
to
do
so
after
the
commission,
who
its
director
of
finance,
mr.
boyden,
had
made
that
very
suggestion.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
i'm
--
i'm
coming
to
that
very
question
right
now
and
i'll
develop
that
answer
to
your
honor's
question
at
this
very
moment.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
i
go
now
to
the
merger
question,
which
is
the
basis
of
your
honor's
question
to
me.
alleghany
argues
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
orders
approving
the
merger
constituted
an
acquisition
of
control.
they
must
prevail
on
this
argument
because
on
this
argument
alone,
if
there
--
if
there
is
no
5
(2)
transaction,
as
i've
just
pointed
out
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
then
5
(3)
status
may
not
be
invested
in
alleghany.
we
say
and
the
united
states
agrees
with
us
that
the
merger
was
not
an
acquisition
of
control,
it
--
this
is
one
of
the
--
as
mr.
justice
douglas
said,
the
key
questions
in
the
case,
the
merger
was
not
an
acquisition
of
control
because
there
was
no
change
in
the
control
before
or
after
the
merger.
alleghany
had
the
same
degree
of
control
over
the
bridge
company
after
the
merger
as
it
did
prior
to
the
merger.
what
happened
was
this,
the
big
four
owned
all
of
the
stock
of
the
bridge
company
and
had
the
big
four
being
controlled
or
substantially
controlled
by
the
new
york
central
entered
into
a
lease
with
the
new
york
central.
and
instead
of
putting
the
bridge
company's
properties
in
making
that
physically
subject
to
the
lease
or
part
of
the
(inaudible)
of
the
lease.
what
they
did
was
to
lease
the
stock
of
--
a
100%
of
the
stock
of
the
bridge
company,
so
that
in
effect,
before
this
merger
was
conceived
or
even
made
the
subject
of
this
application,
new
york
central
had
the
same
degree,
quantum
of
control
over
the
bridge
company
as
it
had
after
the
merger
was
made
the
subject
to
the
application
and
consummate
it.
the
properties
were
substituted
for
the
stock,
and
in
effect,
the
same
degree
of
control
reposed
in
the
parties
before
and
after.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
i
--
i
can't
see
any
change
in
the
quantum
of
control,
your
honor.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
yes,
but
this
--
this
was
--
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
well,
what
they
dealt
with
was
not
the
control
of
the
corporations
but
the
control
of
the
properties
that
were
involved,
and
those
--
and
those
properties
in
the
--
in
the
posture
in
which
it
comes
here,
those
--
that
the
transfer
of
those
properties
into
the
lease
between
big
four
and
central
was
not
an
acquisition
of
control
within
the
meaning
on
section
5
(2).
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
under
the
lease.
under
the
lease
where
the
big
four
which
owned
all
the
stock
of
the
bridge
--
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
it
was
a
lease
between
the
big
four
which
converted
the
big
four
from
an
operating
carrier
into
a
lessor
and
the
new
york
central
operated
the
properties
under
that
lease.
and
included
in
the
(inaudible)
of
the
lease
was
the
stock,
100%
of
the
stock
of
the
bridge
company.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
the
properties
were
substituted
for
the
stock,
the
merger
was
consummated
and
the
stock
was
cancelled
out,
that's
precisely
what
happened.
now
--
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
yes,
that's
what
they
ask
for,
that's
--
that
was
the
burden
of
their
application.
section
5
(3)
by
its
terms
applies
only
two
and
i
quote
from
the
statute,
“whenever
a
non-carrier
person
is
authorized,
by
an
order
entered
in
paragraph
(2),
to
acquire
control
of
any
carrier
or
two
or
more
carriers.”
it
is
that
language
which
makes
it
necessary
to
find
before
carrier
status
can
be
invested
if
there
has
been
a
non-carrier
person
actually
acquiring
control
of
a
carrier.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
right
now,
sir.
right
now.
the
boston
and
albany
proceedings
did
not
involve
carriers.
that's
the
threshold
observation
that
i
declare
to
make.
it
was
an
acquisition
of
lessors
and
not
carriers,
and
there's
a
fundamental
distinction
between
lessors
and
carriers,
and
it's
a
distinction
recognized
both
in
the
statute
and
by
the
judicial
cases.
the
term
carrier
is
defined
by
statute,
section
5
(13)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
there's
no
reference
to
this
in
--
in
the
opposing
briefs,
“as
used
in
paragraph
(2)
to
(12),
and
that
includes
the
section
(5)
that
we're
talking
about
here
inclusive,
the
term
carrier
means
a
carrier
by
railroad
and
an
expressed
company
subject
to
this
part,
namely
part
i
of
the
interstate
commerce
act”.
the
second
sentence
of
section
1
(3)
(a)
of
the
act
says
that,
“whenever
the
word
“carrier”
is
used
in
this
part,
it
should
be
held
to
mean
a
common
carrier.”
and
section
1
(4)
says,
“a
common
carrier
has
the
duty
to
provide
and
furnish
transportation
to
establish
reasonable
through
routes
with
such
other
carriers
in
just
and
reasonable
rates.”
now,
we
say
the
necessary
effect
of
that
distinction
is
current
upon
the
phase
of
the
statute,
but
it's
been
recognized
by
at
least
one
--
at
least
one
case
that
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
nor
it
was
the
statutory
court
decision
in
the
group
of
boston
and
providence
railroad
corporation
stockholders
against
interstate
commerce
commission,
decided
1955
and
affirmed
by
this
court
at
350
u.s.
926.
the
statutory
court
there
held
that
the
boston
and
providence
railroad
was
not
a
--
was
a
lessor
and
that
were
not
a
carrier
within
the
meaning
of
part
i
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
well,
that
was
the
effect
of
the
decision.
what
they
sought
in
that
case
was
not
an
acquisition
--
to
approve
an
acquisition
of
control
that
had
to
do
with
rate
matters.
and
so
the
precise
question
that
your
honor
puts
to
me
was
not
in
formulated
form
before
the
court
is
prepared,
it
wasn't
presented
by
that
case.
but
--
but
if
the
lessor
actually
makes
an
application
for
control,
presumably
the
--
if
the
application
is
granted,
it
would
convert
it
into
a
carrier
by
virtue
of
the
fact
to
be
taken
control.
in
any
rate
the
question
is
not
here
and
it
wasn't
in
that
case.
now,
your
honors,
even
if
we
are
wrong
on
every
other
question
in
this
case,
and
i
put
my
arguments
too
as
i
go
along
within
this
complex
because
i
think
as
i've
tried
to
say
earlier
in
the
case,
there
are
four
or
five
substantive
questions
here,
any
one
of
which
can
resolve
a
question
in
--
with
finality.
even
if
we're
wrong
on
the
rest
of
the
arguments
that
we've
made,
the
failure
to
join
young
and
kirby
as
controlling
persons
were
required
alleghany's
application
to
be
dismissed.
there
is
no
discussion
about
this
in
the
icc
brief
and
we
find
no
reference
to
it
in
the
alleghany
reply
brief.
i
believe
mr.
ginnane
conceded
here
there's
at
least
one
case
that
the
icc
decided,
in
which
it
held
that
individuals
may
be
necessary
and
controlling
parties.
but
the
findings
in
this
case
make
it
clear
that
the
controlling
parties
were
the
individuals,
and
therefore,
when
necessary
the
parties
to
the
application.
division
4,
for
example,
found
as
a
consequence
a
holding
company
and
those
in
control
thereof
admittedly
acquired
control
of
a
carrier
which
controls
subsidiary
carriers,
the
references
to
alleghany
and
to
young
and
kirby.
the
full
commission
found
that
alleghany
and
its
allied
interests
have
succeeded
in
electing
sufficient
members
of
the
board
to
permit
them
to
organize
and
elect
their
own
officers.
and
the
finally,
the
district
court
held,
“the
position
taken
by
the
plaintiffs
throughout
has
been
that
alleghany
was
but
an
instrument
employed
by
the
young,
kirby,
murchison
group
in
the
control
of
the
new
york
central
and
was
in
no
sense
in
control.
it
is
to
be
observed
that
the
findings
of
neither
division
4
nor
the
icc
met
these
issues
squarely.”
and
then
the
court
goes
on
to
say,
“we
are
forced
therefore
to
the
conclusion
that
the
findings
do
no
more
than
say
that
alleghany,
with
someone
else,
controls
new
york
central,
they
do
not
even
say
whether
did
someone
else
alone
has
control,
does
that
satisfy
the
statute?”
that
was
the
question
that
the
district
court
opposed.
now,
everyone
in
this
case
agrees
that
the
marshall
transport
case
requires
the
joinder
of
controlling
parties.
that
was
what
it
held.
we
say
that
control
of
new
york
central
being
invested
in
the
individuals,
namely,
to
prior
acquittal
to
use
the
language
in
the
--
of
division
4
which
was
adopted
by
the
full
commission
and
by
the
court
vested
in
“those
in
control.”
and
that
by
reason
of
the
fact,
those
in
control
were
necessary
parties
and
the
application
had
to
be
dismissed
for
failure
to
join
them.
now,
your
honors,
i
come
to
the
hearing
question
which
is
not
a
necessarily
determined
question
in
this
case,
unless
we
our
wrong
on
every
other
point.
we
needed
--
we
say
we
didn't
need
a
hearing
in
order
to
establish
the
nullity
of
these
icc
orders,
we
sell
--
we
say
that
they
fell
by
their
own
weight
and
by
the
jurisdictional
infirmities
which
i
pointed
out.
but
we
say
if
we're
wrong
on
every
such
question,
the
failure
to
grant
us
a
hearing
renders
the
orders
null.
now,
with
great
deference
to
other
side,
who
suggested
here
that
there
was
a
hearing,
i
must
say
that
there
was
no
hearing
in
fact.
i
think
they
--
what
they
meant
is
that
we
got
a
hearing
when
the
icc
glanced
at
our
pleadings
and
in
camera
so
to
speak
made
its
decision.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
well,
we
say
that
if
--
if
the
statute
is
to
be
construed
--
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
it
said
--
it
says
that
--
yes,
but
we
submit
that
we're
entitled
to
at
least
some
kind
of
a
hearing
even
if
it
not
be
a
public
hearing,
there
are
procedural
--
there
are
procedural
--
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
but
the
issues
were
controverted
and
they
couldn't
be
resolved
on
the
pleadings
and
the
icc
owns
rule
--
own
rules
of
practice
state
that
where
there
is
a
kind
--
for
where
there
is
a
denial
of
a
ultimate
issue
of
fact
that
that
is
not
deemed
admitted.
so
therefore,
if
we
have
alleghany
on
the
one
side
saying
we
control
central
and
we
have
--
we
have
the
appellees
on
the
other
side
saying
you
don't
control
the
central,
unless
you
are
to
say
that
our
denials
of
the
control
were
not
made
in
good
faith
and
were
not
supported
by
demonstrable
facts
which
--
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
yes.
well,
the
court
below
found
that
even
if
the
commission
had
discretion
as
to
a
public
hearing
that
it
was
obliged
to
give
us
some
kind
of
a
hearing.
the
court
below
pointed
out
that
in
the
commission's
rules,
there
are
various
procedures
for
modified
hearings
or
short
--
shortened
hearings
which
are
different
in
character
from
a
public
hearing,
but
at
least
that
much
of
a
hearing
was
required.
we
got
none
and
we
had
tended
issues
that
bore
directly
on
the
public
interest.
we
had
pointed
out
our
own
station
that
in
the
icc
proceedings,
we
pointed
out
the
possible
dilution
of
our
stockholdings
that
we
were
facing
the
loss
of
the
benefits
and
protection
of
the
act.
we
specifically
tended
the
unfairness
of
the
stock
plan
and
yet
we
got
no
hearing
of
any
kind,
public
or
--
or
modified,
or
shortened
hearing.
we
were
left
with
our
pleadings
and
no
opportunity
to
examine
or
cross-examine
alleghany's
witnesses.
we
had
no
opportunity,
in
other
words,
of
adducing
before
the
icc
the
things
that
were
adduced
before
the
scc.
and
while
i'll
admit
the
distinction
in
the
statute,
we
think
in
terms
of
the
due
process
requirement
and
--
and
a
fair
hearing
to
us,
some
kind
of
hearing
whether
it
was
public
or
non-public
was
to
us.
we
had
made
specific
offers
of
proof
and
allegations
in
our
pleading
of
these
crucial
issues
of
fact.
we
tended
the
proof.
we
said
what
we
would
prove
if
we
were
permitted
to
--
to
give
testimony
and
to
cross-examine
and
we
got
no
recognition
of
that
position
at
any
time.
all
that
we
--
all
that
we
got
was
a
denial
of
our
request
for
a
hearing
on
the
day
that
the
cases
were
disposed
of
on
the
merits.
mr.
george
brussel,
jr.
your
honors,
it's
argued
finally
that
we
were
not
required
--
we
were
not
required
to
have
--
we
did
not
have
to
have
a
hearing
because
our
interest
in
this
proceeding
is
too
small.
and
i
assume
that
the
reference
is
to
the
fact
that
we
represent
but
1700
shares
of
alleghany's
common
stock
in
comparison
to
the
enormity
of
the
interest
who
oppose
us
and
who
are
arguing
in
our
position.
i
don't
have
to
argue
here
that
whatever
due
process
if
infirmity
existed
in
this
administration
--
administrative
agency's
action
and
then
its
failure
to
give
us
a
hearing
applies
equally
to
the
smallest
as
well
as
to
the
greatest
in
the
land.
