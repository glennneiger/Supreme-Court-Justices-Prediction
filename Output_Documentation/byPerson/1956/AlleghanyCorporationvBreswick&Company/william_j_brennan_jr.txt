j.
brennan,

i
--
i
understand
that
allegheny
has
not
divested
itself
of
holdings
in
c
&
o?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
--
when
allegheny
acquired
control
of
new
york
central,
it
didn't
have
to
get
provision
from
the
--
or
at
least
it
did
not
get
permission?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
it's
a
single
carrier
or
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
how
did
the
--
how
did
the
merger
satisfy
that,
those
words
in
control
of
any
carrier?how
did
the
merger
can
you
explain
that
that
--
it's
not
clear
in
my
mind.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
a
rearrangement
of
succeeding
areas
and
affiliate
within
the
--
a
system
would
be
sufficient
then
to
satisfy
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
would
think
that
the
difficulty
in
making
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
because
of
the
--
and
for
that
reason,
alleghany
did
not
have
to
seek
authority
to
acquire
the
new
york
central
control?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
in
--
in
itself
was
coming
by
that,
a
non-carrier
controller
of
a
carrier?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
didn't
have
to
get
permission
for
that
in
the
i.c.c.?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
a
policy
matter
of
--
what's
in
the
mind
of
the
commission?
why
do
they
think
that
they
should
have
been
be
pertinent
with
that
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
involves
--
each
involves
a
judgment
on
the
quality
of
(inaudible)
to
some
extent.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
--
does
the
record
show
any
right
between
alleghany
and
these
individual
holders
of
stock
for
the
consolidation
of
the
holding
deal
to
alleghany?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

what
--
what
--
speaking
of
that
resolution,
what's
the
significance
of
the
paragraph
from
following
the
one
that
you
directed
our
attention
to,
resolve
that
as
this
board
is
sub
to
the
opinion
that
it
is
in
the
best
interest
of
this
corporation
at
this
time
for
mr.
young
and
kirby
to
seek
representation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
you
don't
suppose
it
has
any
--
was
that
permissible
entrance
from
this
that
what
young
and
kirby
were
doing
was
in
the
thinking
of
the
board,
being
done
in
the
interest
of
the
corporation
or
rather
than
in
the
first
interest?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i'm
addressing
myself
to
what
apparently
is
in
the
minds
of
the
board
when
this
resolution
was
adopted.
i'm
just
suggesting
that
doesn't
mean
what
i've
read
you
indicate
that
at
least
the
board
thought,
rightly
or
wrongly,
what
mrs.
oung
and
kirby
were
doing
was
being
done
in
the
best
interest
of
the
corporation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
assuming
that
the
acquisition
of
new
york
central
was
a
single
transaction,
a
single
operation,
then
what
was
it
that
required,
or
brought
about,
or
why
did
alleghany
asked
for
approval
of
the
acquisition
of
the
bridge,
was
that
dependent
--
the
bridge,
as
i
understand
it,
was
a
part
of
the
big
four.
it
is
a
subsidiary?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right
then.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
i
understand
it
then
before
--
before
this
approval
of
transaction
of
the
bridge,
already
the
new
york
central
had
all
the
stock
in
the
bridge
company?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
what
lease?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
when
this
transaction
came
up,
there
was
a
transfer
or
a
lease
of
the
bridge
property
itself
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
that
what
they
asked
for
when
they
asked
for
the
approval
of
it?
