mr.
alexander
kahan
mr.
chief
justice
and
justices.
i'm
going
to
take
just
a
few
moments
because
my
brother
at
the
bar,
mr.
levin
has
covered
pretty
much
what
i
wanted
to
say
regarding
the
sacrifice
that
has
been
brought
to
the
common
stockholders
he
has
illustrated
with
respect
to
his
group
the
preferred
stockholders.
there
are
4,600,000
shares
of
common
stock.
700
of
those
shares
are
the
plaintiffs,
appellees
here.
92%
plus
voted
for
the
exchange
plan.
72%
of
the
total
issue
voted
for
it.
in
30
years,
there's
been
no
dividend
declared
on
the
common
stock.
the
opportunity
which
this
exchange
afford
for
that
possibility
in
the
foreseeable
future
has
now
been
hamstrung
by
an
inequitable
procedure,
endorsed
by
the
statutory
court.
so
that
--
because
of
the
havoc
brought
by
this
injunction
for
severity
with
which
the
injunction
has
borne
down
upon
the
alleghany
affairs
almost
at
crippling
(inaudible),
no
director's
meetings
possible,
no
stockholders'
meeting
possible
and
all
the
other
functions
of
the
organization,
the
magnitude
of
alleghany.
i
ask
this
court
in
an
exercise
of
an
informed
and
sound
discretion
vacate
the
injunction.
thank
you.
