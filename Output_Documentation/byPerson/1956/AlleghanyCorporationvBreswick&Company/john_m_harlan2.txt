do
you
go
to
the
extent
of
saying
that
any
rearrangement
of
the
corporate
relationship
suffices?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
difference
in
situation
here
as
i
understand
it
was
that
before
the
bridge
company
transaction,
the
big
four
owned
all
of
the
stock
of
bridge
customers.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
the
big
four
was
owned
by
the
new

central?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
the
effect
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
so,
the
effect
of
this
merger
was
simply
to
bring
in
the
bridge

into
the
big
four?

john
m.

yes.
justice

m.
harlan
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
far
as
alleghany's
relationship
to
the
bridge
company
is
concerned,
what
actual
difference
was
there
before
and
after
the
merger
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
as
regards
to
its
degree
or
of
--
of
control?
justice
john
m.
harlan
one
step
up
the
ladder?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
you
say
there
is
no
need,
whatever,
on
the
boston
and
albany
transaction
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
at
all?
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
seymour
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
on
the
basis
of
the
commission's
findings,
what
have
you
got
to
say
to
the
point
that
young
and
kirby
were
necessary
parties
for
the
proceeding?
