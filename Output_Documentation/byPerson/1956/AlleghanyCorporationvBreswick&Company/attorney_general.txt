mr.
attorney
general
may
i
have
--
i
think
i
have
about
six
minutes,
if
i
may.
mr.
attorney
general
your
honors,
i'd
like
to
argue
this
point
very
briefly
on
the
assumption
that
alleghany
did,
in
fact,
acquire
control
of
new
york
central.
and
therefore,
it
will
have
the
standing
to
make
the
merger
application.
the
fact
is
that
in
the
report
of
the
icc,
there
is
no
finding
of
an
acquisition
of
control
by
virtue
of
the
merger.
the
finding
merely
is
an
approval
of
“continuation
of
control”.
there
is
no
finding
in
the
order
or
no
recital
in
the
order
that
control
was
acquired.
the
order
merely
says,”continuation
of
control”
by
alleghany
is
approved.
mr.
justice
burton
turning
to
the
boston
and
albany
proceeding,
that
proceeding,
we
were
given
no
notice
of
whatsoever.no
opportunity
to
be
heard,
no
opportunity
to
file
a
proceeding.
the
commission
did
not
find
on
the
basis
of
that
proceeding
that
alleghany
should
be
given
carrier
status.
it
did
say
that
because
it
already
given
that
status
in
the
bridge
company
order
is
as
somewhat
unnecessary
to
do
so,
but
had
we
been
heard
and
had
the
issue
come
up
in
the
district
court
on
time
and
not
after
on
a
motion
for
reargue,
we
could
have
pointed
out
as
mr.
brussel
did
here,
that
these
were
not
carriers,
they
were
lessors.
and
again,
the
report
of
the
commission
in
that
case
described
all
three
of
the
boston
and
albany
companies
as
lessors.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
sir.
but
they
didn't
find
any
acquisition
of
control
of
carriers
which
was
the
sole
basis
under
which
you
get
on
--
into
5
(3)
or
into
5
(2)
by
a
non-carrier.
mr.
attorney
general
pardon
sir?
mr.
attorney
general
well,
you
read
the
application
of
alleghany
corporation,
you
will
see
that
alleghany
says
that
they
are
lessors.
alleghany
was
not
standing
on
that
application
to
get
status
as
a
carrier.
it
was
standing
on
a
bridge
company
application.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
sir.
the
statute
does,
the
statute
does
at
section
5
(13).
alleghany's
brief,
reply
brief
here
says
that
section
5
applies
the
carriers
and
lessors
but
it
doesn't
call
this
court's
attention,
section
5
(13),
which
says
that
it
applies
to
railroads
as
defined
in
part
i.
i
will
give
you
the
exact
language
if
you
want
it,
i
don't
have
it
--
i
didn't
give
it
to
you
exactly
just
then.
but
the
language
is
section
5
(13),
“as
used
in
paragraphs
(2)
to
(12)
inclusive,
the
term
carrier
means
a
carrier
by
railroad
and
an
express
company
subject
to
this
part.”
you
turn
to
section
1
(3)
(a),
the
defining
section
of
the
statute,
“whenever
the
word
“carrier”
is
used
in
this
part,
it
shall
be
held
to
mean
common
carrier
and
the
common
carrier
has
the
duty
under
section
1
(4)
to
provide
and
furnish
transportation
and
to
establish
reasonable
through
routes
with
other
such
carriers
in
just
and
reasonable
rates.”
now,
all
these
companies,
what
the
boston
and
albany
companies
do
are
to
receive
rentals
and
to
pay
them
out
to
their
stockholders,
they
performed
none
of
these
functions
which
the
statute
says
a
carrier
must
perform.
mr.
attorney
general
of
a
carrier,
no,
sir.
the
--
the
control
was
already
achieved
by
central
under
99
year
leases
and
999
year
leases.
central
has
complete
control
both
before
and
after
this
transaction.
for
tax
reasons,
the
statute
--
the
internal
revenue
act
was
--
was
changed
so
as
direct
corporations
in
this
--
in
this
situation
to
make
a
consolidated
return
if
they
owned
85%
of
the
stock
of
the
affiliated
company.
that
was
the
whole
basis
of
the
transaction,
and
this
is
an
issue
as
mr.
brussel
pointed
out
was
not
litigated
in
the
district
court.
the
judicial
decision
which
we
found
out
came
down
after
the
final
hearing,
and
we,
of
course,
do
not
know
if
at
that
time
this
court
would
affirm
it
as
it
did
in
1956,
but
that
distinction
of
lessor
and
carrier
has
been
affirmed
based
on
icc
precedence
which
are
referred
to
--
mr.
attorney
general
i
don't
say
that
sir,
because
maybe
under
other
sections
of
the
statute,
not
section
5,
under
section
20
where
lessors
are
regulated
have
certain
accounting
and
other
regulatory
problems
that
may
well
be.
i
haven't
examined
it
in
that
light,
but
i
do
say
this
to
you
sir,
that
the
icc's
jurisdiction
is
not
diminished
in
one
wit
because
if
these
lessors
did
anything
at
change,
they
control
the
railroad,
then
they
would
be
caught
or
the
central,
the
parent
company
would
be
caught
by
the
carrier
provisions
for
the
first
three
clauses
of
section
5
(2),
not
the
non-carrier
provisions
of
the
fourth
and
fifth
clauses.
so
this
is
not
diminishing
in
one
wit
the
icc's
regulatory
powers
over
these
kind
of
companies.
all
we're
saying
here
is
there
was
no
basis
in
icc
--
in
the
icc
statute
to
find
that
was
an
acquisition
of
control
of
a
carrier
by
any
of
these
transactions.
and
in
the
bridge
company,
of
course,
big
four
is
a
lessor.
and
the
only
carrier
who's
control
is
legibly
is
acquired
is
this
two
and
a
half
mile
company
called
the
bridge
company
out
of
some
thousand
miles
of
new
york
central
system.
and
that
brings
--
it
gets
one
other
point,
alleghany
claims
that
it
didn't
have
to
make
a
control
application
for
control
of
the
73
carriers.
although,
the
statute
says
in
clause
4
of
section
5
(2),
that
two
or
more
carriers,
whenever
their
control
is
acquired,
must
be
authorized
and
must
be
approved.
and
it
was
alleghany
itself
which
--
whose
activities
in
1937
lead
to
the
senate
interstate
commerce
commission's
investigation,
which
lasted
from
1937
to
1940,
27
reports
were
issued
by
that
committee
of
which
half
of
them
dealt
with
alleghany
and
it
was
to
close
the
very
loophole
in
the
statute
which
they
alleged
existed.
then
alleghany
alleged
--
mr.
young
and
mr.
kirby
alleged
existed
so
they
--
didn't
have
to
bring
a
scrutiny
of
chesapeake
and
ohio
control
to
alleghany
to
the
commission.
it
was
that
very
loophole
which
was
singled
out
in
senate
report
number
180,
mentioned
in
our
brief
and
which
it
should
be
closed
if
it
exists.
we
don't
think
it
exists
under
one
interpretation,
the
courts
may
find
it
doesn't
exist
under
a
null
kind
of
interpretation
of
the
1933
statute.
but
if
it
does
exist,
it
should
be
closed
and
we
don't
think
that
any
fine
spent
arguments
now
when
it's
right,
this
should
await
further
action
by
the
congress.
in
1940,
congress
amended
the
statute
and
made,
in
its
own
words,
clarifying
changes,
that's
in
the
conference
report.
i
don't
want
to
detail
the
statutory
changes
that
are
on
page
70
of
our
brief
but
they
do
say
in
effect,
if
you
acquire
control
of
two
or
more
carriers
through
ownership
of
their
stock
then
you
have
to
come
to
--
to
the
commission,
that
was
the
1933
statute,
through
ownership
of
their
stock,
mind
you,
from
--
in
--
in
that
posture
of
the
statute,
new
york
central
was
the
only
stock
whose
--
whose
acquisition
is
of
course
being
acquired
by
alleghany.
it
didn't
go
to
the
72
other
carriers
because
no
ownership
of
the
72
carriers
stock
was
being
acquired.
therefore,
the
statute
was
amended
to
say,
if
you
acquire
control
of
two
or
more
carriers
through
ownership
of
their
stock,
or
otherwise,
those
two
words
we
put
in,
or
otherwise,
therefore,
when
you
acquire
the
control
of
new
york
central
company,
just
one
stock
transaction,
it
didn't
acquire
control
of
the
72
through
ownership
of
their
stock,
you
acquire
control
of
them
or
through
the
otherwise
clause
because
central
had
that
stock.
and
the
senate
report
said,
this
is
an
--
an
ambiguity
in
the
statute,
they
used
that
very
word,
there's
an
ambiguity
here
and
the
proof
is
ambiguity,
mr.
's
young
and
kirby
and
the
people
before
them
were
crossing
around
the
control
of
a
great
railroad
system
as
if
it
were
a
tie
balloon,
that's
the
words
of
the
chairman.
it
was
chairman
of
the
committee
in
1937
and
chairman
in
1940
and
that's
why
this
--
this
statute
should
be
amended
to
prevent
this
kind
of
--
of
transfer
of
control.
i
want
to
make
one
more
reference
to
this
point.
mr.
ginnane
refers
to
the
difficulty
of
proxy
contestants
if
this
interpretation
of
the
statute
which
we
think
is
the
law
is
adopted.
he
says
that
everybody
who
acquires
control
in
the
proxy
contest
would
have
to
come
to
--
to
the
commission,
that
isn't
so
sir.
because
if
nobody
has
acquired
controlling
blocks
of
stock
as
young
and
kirby
did
with
their
associates,
their
million
shares,
then
of
course,
without
any
controlling
blocks
of
stock
for
10,000
stockholders
have
control,
but
they
don't
exercise
it
until
that
one
day
they
come
together
for
the
meeting
and
they
voted.
and
they
merely
had
voted,
the
directors
take
office
and
the
stock
control
is
dissipated
again
among
the
10,000
units
or
whatever
the
number
of
stockholders
maybe.
if
the
only
coalesces
of
each
election,
there
is
no
acquisition
of
control
within
the
statutory
language.
and
it's
only
because
of
this
that
the
--
this
argument
that
alleghany
seeks
to
avoid
scrutiny
of
the
public
interest
finding
that
it
has
acquired
control.
thank
you,
your
honor.
