mr.
harold
h.
levin
mr.
levin.
mr.
harold
h.
levin
yes.
i
represent
--
mr.
harold
h.
levin
--
the
--
the
appellants
gruss,
et
al.,
who
on
behalf
of
preferred
stockholder
similarly
situated,
intervened
in
the
proceeding
below.
and
i
should
like
to
move
forward
from
the
technical
question
of
control
and
--
and
jurisdiction
of
the
i.c.c.
to
the
issuance
of
the
injunction
which
had
a
very
disastrous
effect
on
the
holders
of
$40
million
of
security.
in
saying
that,
i
don't
want
to
minimize
for
a
moment
the
problem
that
is
before
this
court
respecting
the
kind
of
jurisdiction,
the
public
interest
that
is
involved
in
the
--
in
the
question
of
jurisdiction
of
the
i.c.c.
i
think
it's
very
important
and
undoubtedly
will
receive
great
--
a
great
deal
of
consideration.
nonetheless,
part
from
that,
there
is
the
problem
as
to
whether
the
court
below
having
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
i.c.c.
should
not
have
continued
its
jurisdiction,
whether
it
should
have
acted
in
such
a
fashion
as
retroactively,
to
take
away
that
jurisdiction
and
cancel
out
every
administrative
order
that
was
issued
by
the
commission
in
the
interval.
and
there,
it
seems
to
me,
is
where
the
great
damage
that
was
done
in
this
case
lie.
mr.
harold
h.
levin
i
--
the
--
the
power
of
the
court
to
enter
the
injunction
that
was
issued
below,
not
as
an
exercise
of
discretion
but
as
a
power
and
the
manner
in
which
it
should
exercise
that
power.
it
seems
to
me
that
when
congress
enacted
this
various
agency
statutes
and
placed
corporations
and
entities
under
an
administrative
agency,
it
told
the
public
that
they
have
a
right
to
rely
upon
those
agencies
when
they
act.
and
that
nobody
is
going
to
come
along
to
stockholders
who
owned
$7000
worth
of
stock,
a
week
later
or
a
year
later
or
10
years
later
and
say
that
the
i.c.c.
would
have
entered
this
order
of
approval
didn't
have
jurisdiction
and
therefore,
the
issue
is
void.
therefore,
the
stocks
have
to
be
returned.,
there
must
be
a
recission
and
the
whole
marketplace
must
be
turned
upside
down
and
that's
what
happened
to
this
case,
because
within
the
short
period
between
the
approval
of
the
exchange
offer
and
the
issuance
of
a
--
the
restraining
order,
a
great
many
shares
changed
hands.
900,000
shares
of
the
total
of
about
140,000
or
130,000
something
had
been
actually
distributed,
all
of
them
issued.
no
stockholder,
no
preferred
stockholder
had
any
longer
in
his
possession
a
certificate
of
stock.
mr.
harold
h.
levin
well,
that
brings
us
to
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
review
of
status
under
an
agency
lies
within
the
power
of
--
of
a
stockholder.
it
seems
to
me
that
as
--
that
where
--
whether
or
not
--
mr.
harold
h.
levin
i
am.
i'm
--
i'm
willing
to
face
that.
mr.
harold
h.
levin
yes,
sir.
it
seems
to
me
that
a
stockholder
does
not
have
the
right
under
the
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
some
over
the
years
to
come
into
court
and
say,
“i
don't
think
that
we
should
be
under
the
i.c.c.
jurisdiction.”
i
don't
--
mr.
harold
h.
levin
in
spite
of
that
because
he's
still
talking
about
status
and
status
alone
and
i
don't
think
that
that
he
can
be
heard
to
say
that
there
is
something
preferable
as
the
court
below
seemed
to
think
in
the
sec
as
against
the
i.c.c.
and
i
can
back
that
up
by
the
enactment
by
congress
of
section
3
(c)
(9)
of
the
--
of
the
investment
company
act
which
in
effect
said
in
our
estimate,
“jurisdiction
of
the
i.c.c.
is
at
least
as
good
as
the
sec
and
if
you're
under
the
i.c.c.,
you
don't
have
to
come
under
the
sec.
now,
the
congress
--
mr.
harold
h.
levin
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
harold
h.
levin
that
they
may
protest,
but
the
fact
is
that
they
are
showing,
as
judge
hincks
stated,
"no
legal
injury,
no
irreparable
damage
to
justify
the
--
a
court
of
equity
to
grant
the
kind
of
injunction
it
had
here
where
their
only
objection
is
that
they
are
going
to
be
better
treated
under
the
sec
than
under
the
i.c.c.”,
which
i
say
falls
when
you
consider
that
congress
had
given
the
senior
agency
the
standing
to
substitute
for
the
s.c.c.
in
regard
to
the
safeguard
of
the
rights
of
security
holdings.
and
that
congress
made
this
--
show
the
same
respect
for
the
i.c.c.,
when
it
enacted
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
where
employees
come
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
i.c.c.
they
don't
--
they
are
not
afforded
the
protection
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
i
don't
think
that
any
employee
of
company
could
come
in
and
say,
"i
object
to
this
trucking
company,
my
employer
being
under
the
i.c.c.
i
want
to
get
out
from
under
and
i
want
the
protection
of
fair
labor
standards
act."
i
think
the
administration
of
these
agency
acts
would
--
would
--
will
get
us
into
the
difficulty
that
we
got
into
in
this
very
case.
mr.
harold
h.
levin
i
don't
say
that
--
that
congress
couldn't
constitutionally
--
mr.
harold
h.
levin
i
certainly
would
not.
i
say,
it
did
not
do
so.
i
say
that
congress
said
insofar
as
agency
regulation
is
concerned,
if
you
come
under
the
i.c.c.,
if
a
corporation
comes
under
the
i.c.c.,
that
satisfy
the
investment
company
act
and
you
don't
have
to
pay
any
attention
to
it.
i
say
further
that
this
court
has
held
that
where
you're
arguing
status,
a
common
stockholder,
a
minority
stockholder
cannot
be
heard
to
question
status.and
if
–
if
he
could
and
just
imagine
that
if
this
were
done
10
years
from
now,
the
--
the
problem
that
would
confront
alleghany
and
the
–
and
the
–
the
community.
mr.
harold
h.
levin
well,
i
think
--
i
think
of
--
i'll
now
turn
to
the
point
that
you
just
mentioned,
because
that's
my
next
point.
my
next
point
is
this.
that
when
--
when
one
applies
to
a
court
of
equity,
contrary
to
what
was
held
below,
he
must
show
irreparable
damage.
and
i
say
again
that
a
stockholder
who
merely
says,
“i
think
i'll
fare
better
under
one
governmental
agency
according
to
jurisdiction
than
another
does
not
show
irreparable
damage,
(a).
(b),
i
go
further.
i
say
no
court
of
equity
issues
an
injunction
of
a
kind
branded
here,
knowing
full
well
the
hardship
that
it
was
going
to
engender,
without
weighing
that
hardship
against
the
relative,
lack
of
hardship
or
lack
of
harm,
lack
of
damage
that
would
go
to
the
owners
of
$7000
worth
of
stock.
particularly,
as
judge,
--
as
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out
in
his
granting
of
a
stay,
where
97.5%
of
the
voting,
stockholder
of
that
same
class
approved
the
issue.
and
that
it
seems
to
me
that
on
that
basis
alone,
this
failure
to
consider
hardship
except
to
admit
it,
because
they
all
did,
i
--i
can
read
to
your
honor,
briefly
from
the
opinions
of
--
of
several
of
the
judges,
mr
judge
dimock
of
the
district
court
when
he
considered
this
problem
and
considered
the
stay,
used
this
language.
"what
makes
the
question
perplexing
is
the
plight
of
innocent
stockholders."
and
he
was
referring
to
the
preferred
stockholders
who
have
given
up
there
old
preferred
stock
and
had
got
a
frozen
asset
in
return.
and
mr.
justice
harlan
said,
“i
am
not
unmindful
of
the
plaintiff's
contention
that
alleghany
proceeded
with
the
preferred
stock
(inaudible)
upon
notice,”
but
he
says,
“that
cannot
be
laid
at
the
door
of
the
preferred
stockholders
generally.”
judge
hincks
said,
“this
feature
of
the
injunction
has
its
chief
impact
on
innocent
stockholders.”
and
he
found
the
injunction
to
be
unnecessary
to
protect
plaintiff's
pecuniary
interest.
on
that
score,
i
would
call,
your
honor's
attention
to
the
fact
that
my
adversary,
mr.
brussel,
stated
at
--
at
page
59
of
the
record
that
the
issuance
of
this
injunction,
would
hurt
the
common
stockholders.
and
anybody
who
read
the
stockmarket
sheets
since
the
injunction
was
issued
would
soon
know,
that
the
stock
which
reached
the
high
of
10
of
the
common
stock,
which
reached
the
high
of
ten
and
three-quarters
is
now
showing
at
around
six
and
three-eighths,
because
this
very
fine
plan,
which
was
fairly
and
just
to
both
the
preferred
and
the
common
was
done
away
with
because
of
this
issue,
over
acquisition
of
control,
over
status
which
is
i
say,
i
do
not
think
the
common
stockholders,
the
minority
common
stockholders
should
be
hurt.
mr.
harold
h.
levin
well,
i
think
it's
--
mr.
harold
h.
levin
i
think
it's
--
it's
done
with
tongue
and
cheek.
mr.
harold
h.
levin
that's
right.
no.
we
won't
go
to
jail.
mr.
harold
h.
levin
but
we
won't
get
the
stock
because
those
who
would
have
to
distribute
it
to
us
would
--
would
go
to
jail
and
i
think
--
mr.
harold
h.
levin
--
i
think
that's
just
a
silly
suggestion
as
--
as
long
as
your
honor
asked
it
of
me.
it
would
--
would
do
deference
to
the
solicitor
general.
it
doesn't
help
us
one
bit.
the
fact
is
that
below,
the
solicitor
general
thought
we
were
right.
he's
changed
his
mind,
because
of
the
determination
of
the
scc
on
an
application
and
i
want
to
take
the
--
the
next
few
moments
to
deal
with
that
if
i
may.
an
application
was
made
by
some
preferred
stockholder,
not
the
clients
i
represent
directly,
but
--
and
by
alleghany
who
seeing
this
terrible
hardship
that
was
being
visited
on
so
many
people,
went
before
the
sec
in
the
hope
that
they
could
get
some
kind
of
an
exemption
to
make
the
stock
issue
proper
even
in
light
of
the
decision
below.
and
the
first
thing
i
want
to
call
your
honor's
attention
to
is
this,
that
our
adversaries
in
their
brief
no
less
than
10
times
state
that
the
sec
found
this
plan
grossly
unfair.
it
found
no
such
thing
in
dealing
with
a
single,
the
testimony
of
a
single
witness
who
stated
that
the
stock
might
reach
curtains
heights.
they
said,
“if
that
were
the
case,
it
would
be
grossly
unfair.”
that's
a
far
cry
from
saying
that
they
found
the
plan
grossly
unfair
to
common
stockholders.
on
the
contrary,
they
found
that
in
view
of
the
--
of
the
potential
difficulty
in
determining
the
value
of
the
stock,
in
view
of
the
conflicting
testimony,
they
didn't
feel
that
they
could
grant
the
exception.
but
what
i
want
to
call
your
honor's
attention
more
particularly
to
is
to
the
fact
that
the
decision
of
the
sec
and
i
don't
think
it's
any
secret
that
there's
a
certain
amount
of
rivalry
between
the
sec
and
the
i.c.c.
in
this
situation
and
we're
caught
squarely
in
the
middle.
they
made
the
most
unprecedented,
interpretation
of
section
18
of
the
act.
now,
if
your
honors
will
look
at
page
7
of
my
reply
brief,
you
will
find
set
forth
there,
section
18
(b),
paraphrase
of
it,
18
(b)
forbids
any
warrant
or
right
to
subscribe
to
--
or
purchase
a
security.
mr.
harold
h.
levin
page
7
of
my
reply
brief
and
then
don't
look
at
the
appendix
of
the
reply
brief.
no,
it's
--
it's
mine
or
the
blue
and
it's
the
thinnest
of
the
blue.
mr.
harold
h.
levin
and
section
18
(d)
provides
that
you
may
not
issue
a
warrant
that
would
last
more
than
120
days.
section
18
(e)
and
this,
i
call
your
honor's
special
attention
to,
provides
that
the
provisions
of
this
section
shall
not
apply
to
any
senior
security
issued
or
sold,
by
any
registered
closed-end
company,
for
the
purpose,
and
i
skip,
of
retirement
or
exchange
any
security
of
such
registered
investment
company.
and
so,
the
question
arises
to
whether
this
is
--
is
my
time
up?
may
i
take
one
more
moment?
the
question
is
whether
this
is
a
senior
security.
now,
a
senior
security
is
defined
just
below
that
19
(g),
which
says,
“senior
security
means
any
bond,
debenture,
note,
et
cetera,
and
any
--
and
evidencing
indebtedness,
and
any
stock
of
a
class
having
priority
over
any
other
class
as
to
distribution
of
assets
or
payment
of
dividends.”
there
isn't
any
dispute
about
the
fact
that
this
issue
had
priority,
both
as
to
dividends
and
as
to
assets.
therefore,
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
it's
clear
that
this
issue
was
examined.
now,
how
do
they
get
around
it?
the
sec
says
that
if
a
senior
--
senior
security
seizes
to
be
one
if
it
has
a
long-term
convertibility.
in
other
words,
the
exception
says,
“it
is
--
it
doesn't
apply
--
it
doesn't
apply
to
a
senior
security.
this
limitation
as
to
convertibility
doesn't
apply
to
a
senior
security.
but
if
a
senior
security
says
the
sec
has
long-term
convertibility,
then
it's
no
longer
a
senior
security.
and
on
that
basis,
the
sec
deny
clearance
on
this
issue.
we
say
however,
of
course,
that
this
is
quite
irrelevant
to
the
issues
presented
in
this
case.
it's
something
that
happened
later,
but
i
think
it's
worth
considering
in
determining
the
equities
of
the
situation.
thank
you,
sir.
