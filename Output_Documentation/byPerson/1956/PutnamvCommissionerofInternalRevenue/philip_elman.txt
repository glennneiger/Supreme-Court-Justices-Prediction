mr.
philip
elman
may
it
please
the
court.
may
i
say
in
further
response
of
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
that
there's
no
dispute
in
this
case
that
the
principal
debtor
or
the
corporation
was
in
existence
at
the
time
the
guaranty
was
paid.
this
is
not
a
case
of
--
mr.
philip
elman
wasn't
--
mr.
philip
elman
it
was
--
it
was
insolvent,
it
had
no
assets
at
the
time
the
guaranty
was
paid
but
the
particular
basis
of
decision
of
the
fox
case,
that
the
debtor
was
not
in
existence,
is
not
present
here.
and
the
case
maybe
distinguished
upon
that
ground.
i
should
like
to
say
that
as
mr.
williams'
--
mr.
philip
elman
the
--
the
facts
as
they
are
reflected
by
the
record
are
that
this
corporation
became
totally
unsuccessful
on
the
summer
of
1947.
it
disposed
of
all
of
its
assets,
it
went
out
of
business.
it
remained
as
mr.
justice
harlan
said
is
a
corporate
shell.
it
--
at
that
time
it
was
indebted
to
a
bank
in
the
sum
of
$8500,
evidenced
by
two
promissory
notes,
which
had
been
signed
by
the
taxpayer
individually
and
as
president
of
the
corporation,
so
that
he
was
apparently
a
co-maker.
but
the
tax
court
found
on
a
basis
of
parole
evidence
that
his
liability
was
that
of
a
--
of
a
surety
or
guarantor.
now,
there's
no
question
that
mr.
putnam
suffered
a
loss
in
1948.
there's
no
question
that
he's
entitled
for
deduction.
what
is
in
dispute
is
the
nature
and
source
of
that
loss
and
the
kind
of
deduction
to
which
he
is
entitled.
the
tax
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
have
held
that
he
is
entitled
to
a
deduction
for
a
bad
debt
under
section
23
(k).
petitioner
is
arguing
here
as
in
the
courts
below
that
he
is
not
entitled
for
a
bad
debt
deduction,
that
on
the
contrary
he
is
entitled
to
a
deduction
for
an
ordinary
loss
under
section
23
(e).
now,
it's
necessary
for
the
taxpayer
to
make
that
contention
because
as
he
pointed
out,
23
(k),
the
bad
debt
provision
and
23
(e),
are
mutually
exclusive.
congress
has
carved
out
of
the
general
category
of
losses.
the
specific
type
of
loss
of
a
bad
debt
and
if
a
taxpayer
who
has
suffered
a
bad
debt
loss
asserts
his
right
to
--
to
a
deduction,
he
must
assert
it
under
23
(k),
the
bad
debt
provision.
so
that
in
this
case
we
have
an
inversion
of
the
usual
situation
in
a
tax
case,
it's
the
commissioner
here
who
is
arguing
that
the
taxpayers
entitled
for
a
bad
deduction,
and
he
is
asserting
very
vigorously
that
he
is
not.
now,
the
reason
he
does
so
is
--
is
quite
obvious
because
both
courts
below
have
held
that
his
loss
was
a
nonbusiness
loss,
it
was
not
incurred
in
his
trade
or
business.
he's
a
practicing
lawyer.
he
is
not
in
the
business
of
making
investments.
so
that
if
its
bad
debt
loss
it
comes
under
23
(k)
(4),
which
is
in
our
brief
on
page
32
and
33.
if
it's
a
nonbusiness
bad
debt
loss,
it's
treated
under
the
statute
as
a
short-term
capital
loss.
in
other
words,
it's
deductible
only
against
capital
gains
plus
$1000
of
his
ordinary
income.
so
that
if
he
doesn't
--
if
he
can
succeed
in
maintaining
the
proposition
that
this
is
not
a
nonbusiness
bad
debt,
he
doesn't
come
on
at
23
(k),
then
he
will
move
over
to
23
(e)
(2),
which
is
on
page
31.
and
he
argues
on
that
branch
of
the
case
that
this
guaranty
was
part
of
a
transaction
entered
into
for
profit.
that
he
was
the
controlling
stockholder
of
this
corporation,
was
really
his
corporation
in
every
sense.
that
if
--
if
this
enterprise,
this
corporate
enterprise
had
been
successful
and
it
was
necessary
to
its
--its
success
that
this
loan
be
made,
and
if
he
be
co-maker
on
it
that
thereby,
he
was
--
he
would
be
improving
his
prospects
of
deriving
profit
from
his
stock
investment
in
the
corporation.
so
that
on
that
phase
of
the
case
it's
a
transaction
entered
into
for
profit
but
not
incurred
in
his
trade
or
business.
now,
he
--
he
therefore,
if
successful
on
that
argument,
would
be
entitled
to
an
ordinary
loss
under
23
(e)
(2),
which
would
be
fully
deductible
against
the
ordinary
income.
now,
i
think
it
might
be
fair
to
point
out
that
if
he's
right
in
this
contention,
that
he
is
not
entitled
to
a
bad
debt
deduction
because
the
--
as
he
calls
of
the
no
debt
theory,
that
the
debt
was
worthless
when
he
acquired
it
through
payment
of
the
guaranty.
that
while
it
may
be
down
to
his
benefit
in
this
case,
that
in
the
ordinary
situation
of
a
person
alone,
not
entered
into
for
profit,
where
the
taxpayer
is
a
guarantor
on
a
loan
made
by
a
friend
or
associate,
and
he
is
compelled
to
make
good
on
the
loan
because
the
principle
is
in
default.
now,
in
that
situation,
the
logic
of
the
taxpayer's
argument
here
would
compel
to
conclusion
that
the
ordinary
taxpayer
in
that
situation
would
have
no
deduction
at
all,
because
under
the
taxpayers
theory
here
he
wouldn't
have
a
bad
debt
deduction
since
there
was
no
debt,
and
you
couldn't
come
under
23
(e)
(2)
because
there
was
no
profit
motive.
now,
coming
to
the
merits
of
the
--
the
so-called
no
debt
theory,
which
as
mr.
williams
pointed
out,
has
been
accepted
in
three
very
recent
decisions.
now,
the
first
one
was
in
the
third
circuit
in
19
--
january
of
1954
and
the
two
other
cases,
the
cudlip
case
in
the
sixth
circuit,
from
which
judge
stewart
dissented,
and
the
case
in
the
fifth
circuit,
the
edwards
and
allen
case.
prior
to
1954
it
had
been
consistently
held
by
the
tax
court,
by
the
commissioner,
by
several
courts
of
appeals,
the
first
circuit
in
hamlen
and
welch
in
116
f.2d,
and
the
second
circuit
in
the
shiman
case
in
60
f.2d,
that
a
guarantor's
loss
was
to
be
treated
as
bad
debt
loss.
the
logic,
the
rationale
of
those
decisions
was
quite
simple,
that
the
loss
arose
from
a
--
from
a
debt
and
therefore
the
deduction
also
was
to
be
treated
as
arising
from
the
debt.
because
the
--
a
surety
or
a
guarantor,
when
he
--
when
he
pays
the
creditor
does
not
there
--
thereby
extinguish
the
debt
by
operation
of
the
familiar
principles
of
subrogation.
the
debt
remains
in
existence
and
what
happens
is
that
the
surety
or
guarantor
is
substituted
for
the
creditor,
and
the
debt
remains
--
mr.
philip
elman
i
think
an
indemnitor
--
indemnitor
may
present
an
entirely
different
situation
because
there
the
creditor
is
in
effect
indemnified
for
a
loss
he
suffered.
it
may
--
it
maybe
distinguishable
in
a
sense
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
isolate
the
debt.
in
a
--
in
a
case
like
that
it
might
be
contented
that
the
indemnitor
is
in
--
is
in
substance
making
a
capital
contribution.
but
i
think
that
the
indemnitor's
situation
raises
problem
which
aren't
here.
and
i
--
i
would
not
think
that
the
problems
in
that
kind
of
case
presented
would
have
to
be
considered
in
connection
with
this
case,
where
it's
clear
that
there
was
a
debt
prior
to
december
2nd,
1948
when
the
taxpayer
paid
these
notes.
under
the
negotiable
instruments
law,
which
is
in
effect
in
iowa,
the
notes
are
not
discharged.
the
debts
--
the
debt
was
not
extinguished.
the
taxpayer
succeeded
to
the
rights
of
the
creditor.
now,
it's
true
that
--
that
the
debt
was
worthless
when
it's
acquired
but
to
the
--
the
fact
that
a
debt
is
worthless
at
its
inception
does
not
negate
its
existence.
a
bad
debt
by
definition
is
an
--
is
a
legal
obligation
which
has
a
--
as
an
obligation
is
valid
but
which
is
a
practical
matter,
which
is
a
matter
a
fact
is
uncollectible
and
worthless.
now,
if
--
if
every
bad
if
--
if
a
bad
debt
were
automatically
a
no
debt,
the
consequence
would
be
to
--
really
to
mutilate
the
concept
of
a
--
of
a
bad
debt
and
i
can
illustrate
that
was
a
simple
example.
suppose
a
lends
money
to
b,
and
at
the
time
the
loan
is
made,
b
is
hopelessly
insolvent
and
the
note
he
gives
is
--
isn't
worth
the
paper
it's
written
on.
the
debt
was
completely
worthless
ab
initio.
now,
that's
precisely
the
kind
of
case
that
comes
within
the
bad
debt
provision,
to
deny
the
lender
the
right
to
take
a
bad
debt
deduction,
in
that
situation
would
be
almost
unthinkable.
it's
never
been
suggested
that
you
have
--
you
have
to
--
you
have
to
find
that
the
debt
had
some
--
some
worth
before
you
uphold
the
deduction.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
think
there's
no
question
in
this
--
in
this
case
that
debt
became
worthless,
because
as
i
say
on
december
2nd,
1948,
when
it
was
paid
it
had
been
--
it
had
worth
for
11
months
and
2
days
of
that
year,
and
it
became
worthless
on
december
2nd.
and
the
statute
says
that
in
the
case
of
a
taxpayer,
other
than
a
corporation,
a
nonbusiness
debt
becomes
worthless
within
the
taxable
year.
this
--
this
debt,
it
did
literally
become
worthless
when
the
guarantor
paid
the
bank
and
the
--
the
argument
that
a
debt
has
to
have
some
value
in
the
hands
of
the
taxpayer
before
it
can
be
deducted.
it
would
i
think
produce
a
confusion
between
the
collectability
of
a
debt
and
its
existence.
if
--if
mr.
putnam
had
brought
an
action
after
paying
these
--
these
notes,
if
he
had
brought
an
action
sounding
in
debt
against
the
corporation,
the
corporation
couldn't
defend
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
debt.
he
couldn't
--
couldn't
file
a
general
denial
thing,
no
debt.
it's
--
the
defense
would
be
a
practical
,
it
was
judgment
proof.
the
debt
was
still
in
existence
but
it
couldn't
be
enforced.
now,
that
seems
to
us
to
be
the
--
followed
in
the
classic
definition
of
a
bad
debt.
now,
the
argument
is
also
--
mr.
philip
elman
excuse
me.
mr.
philip
elman
it's
--
it's
a
loss.
but
the
question
is,
how
did
the
loss
arise
and
--
and
the
argument
that
we're
making
is
that
the
loss
arose
--
mr.
philip
elman
not
at
all,
because
if
it's
a
bad
debt
loss,
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
the
tax
court
finding
that
it
was
bad
debt
loss
stopped
there,
didn't
go
on
to
23
(e)
(2)
because
as
this
court
has
held
in
the
spring
city
case
and
it's
an
elementary
principle
of
tax
law
if
--
if
it's
a
bad
debt,
it
can't
be
an
ordinary
loss.
and
the
taxpayer
--
mr.
philip
elman
if
--
if
the
loss
arises
from
a
debt
transaction,
then
you
consider
the
question
of
deductibility
under
23
(k)
because
congress
has
specially
dealt
with
the
question
of
debt
losses
and
its
--
it
--and
you
can
go
to
23
(e)
only
if
it's
not
a
case
that
falls
within
23
(k).
now,
once
you
find
--
mr.
philip
elman
that
--
that's
not
challenged.
the
--
the
issue
here
is
not
whether
it
was
a
business
loss
or
a
nonbusiness
loss.
it
was
a
nonbusiness
loss,
that's
clear.
the
question
is,
is
it
a
nonbusiness
loss
arising
from
a
debt,
a
bad
debt
or
isn't
it?
if
it's
a
nonbusiness
loss,
arising
from
a
bad
debt,
then
that's
the
end
of
the
case
because
the
tax
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
taxpayer
is
entitled
for
deduction
under
that
provision
but
this
taxpayer
unsatisfied
with
that,
since
it's
only
a
capital
loss
--
mr.
philip
elman
it
doesn't
fall
within
that
if
it's
--
if
the
loss
arises
from
a
debt.
that's
the
spring
city
case
in
292
u.s.
stands
with
a
proposition
that
a
loss
under
23
(e),
if
it's
a
debt
loss
is
to
be
treated
entirely
under
23
(k).
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
i
think
that
there's
no
dispute
as
to
that.
i
don't
really
think
mr.
williams
challenged
that.
that's
--
mr.
philip
elman
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
about
that
proposition
and
if
this
case
comes
under
23
(k)
(4)
because
it's
a
loss
arising
from
a
debt
that's
--
that's
it.
now,
if
i
may
go
on
to
--
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
the--
the
reasoning
of
this
case
is
this
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
these
cases
go
on
--
a
reason
that
if
a
debt
as
a
practical
manner
is
worthless,
it
doesn't
exist.
that's
the
base
--
the
proposition
is
put
it
in
as
boldly
as
that.
and
i
commend
to
your
honors
a
reading
of
judge
stewart's
dissenting
opinion
in
the
cudlip
case,
which
i
think
answer
that
much
more
effectively
than
i
could.
mr.
philip
elman
no,
sir.
i
couldn't
--
i
couldn't
--
mr.
philip
elman
i
couldn't
hope
to
present
the
case
as
well
as
the
judges
have
--
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
and
if
i
--
if
i
may
respond
to
the
argument
that
you've
formulated
sir
--
mr.
philip
elman
well
--
mr.
philip
elman
i
understand
it.
your
paraphrase
--
on
your
paraphrase
you
are
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
the
--
the
argument
that
there
was
no
debt
at
all
is
based
on
--
on
cases
which
hold
that
a
debt
doesn't
arise,
where
there's
--
where
the
creditor
has
no
expectation
of
--
of
repayment.
he
does
--
his
motives
are
other
than
those
and
to
take
the
--
the
illustration,
i
put
a
little
while
ago,
a
lending
money
to
b
and
b
is
hopelessly
insolvent.
now,
suppose
we
add
to
that
one
further
element,
that
a,
when
he
lends
that
money
to
b,
knows
that
b
is
hopelessly
insolvent.
and
when
he
--
when
he
makes
that
loan,
he
doesn't
have
any
hope
or
expectation
of
repayment.
now,
in
those
--
in
that
situation,
and
there
are
cases
that
involved
it.
the
courts
have
held
incorrectly
that
what
appears
to
be
a
loan
on
the
surface
isn't
really
a
loan
at
all,
because
the
creditor
is
in
effect
making
a
gratuity,
a
gift.
so
that
there
are
--
there
are
cases
which
--
which
--
in
which
language
appears,
which
in
the
context
of
those
opinions
is
perfectly
correct
and
--
and
unchallengeable
that
where
there's
no
appropriate
expectation
of
--
of
payment
of
the
debt,
it's
not
a
debt.
now,
to
take
that
language,
which
is
meaningful
in
the
context
of
a
voluntary
loan
to
someone
who
is
insolvent
and
to
translate
it
vitally
to
a
situation
like
this,
where
the
debt
arises
involuntarily
by
operation
of
law,
there
is
no
suggestion
in
this
case
that
the
taxpayer
was
making
a
gift
to
the
corporation.
if
he
were
making
a
gift
to
the
corporation,
he
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
any
deduction
and
to
--
and
we
think
that
if
it's
an
uncritical
application
of
the
--
of
the
language
in
cases
involving
what
is
in
substance
a
gratuity.
now,
in
this
case
we
have
what
in
substance
is
a
capital
investment.
in
this
case
the
corporation
was
setup
in
1946
by
the
taxpayer
and
two
others.
he
furnished
all
of
the
working
capital.
he
contributed
a
building.
he
contributed
a
lot.
he
made
a
direct
loan
from
his
own
pocket
and
the
with
respect
to
the
printing
presses,
they
went
to
the
bank
and
executed
these
two
notes
which
he
signed.
the
collateral
for
the
--
one
of
the
notes
with
his
personal
life
insurance
and
automobile.
and
as
the
tax
court
said,
the
loan
wouldn't
have
been
made
if
--
if
a
taxpayer
individually
hadn't
furnished
this
credit.
he
was
supplying
risk
capital
in
the
form
of
his
credit.
now,
the
whole
theory
of
our
--
the
whole
pattern
of
the
tax
law
is
that
when
one
makes
a
capital
contribution,
whether
it
takes
the
form
of
an
investment
by
buying
stock
or
the
form
of
a
loan
to
the
corporation,
whether
or
not
it's
evidenced
by
security.
if
it's
a
capital
transaction
and
the
investment
is
a
good
one,
the
taxpayer
pays
tax
on
capital
gains.
and
if
the
corporation
fails,
he
is
entitled
to
deductions
on
a
capital
loss
basis.
as
judge
stewart
very
succinctly
pointed
out
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
the
cudlip
case,
if
--
if
the
taxpayer
here
had
borrowed
the
money
from
the
bank
himself,
on
his
own
credit
and
had
turned
around
and
lent
the
money
to
the
corporation,
he
would
have
--
he
would
have
suffered
a
loss
but
would've
been
treated
as
a
capital
loss.
if
he
had
invested
in
the
corporation
by
subscribing
this
additional
stock
so
the
corporation
could
take
that
money
and
buy
these
printing
presses,
that
--
that
too
would
have
been
deductible
as
a
capital
loss,
no
matter
how
he
risked
his
capital.
it
would
have
been
--
it
would
have
given
rise
to
a
deduction
as
a
capital
loss.
now,
if
the
--
if
these
three
circuit
--
circuits
are
right,
if
a
guarantor
if
--
if
the
capital
--
if
capital
is
risked
in
the
form
of
a
guaranty
of
a
bank
loan,
the
result
would
be
that
in
that
single
type
of
investment
the
investor,
if
the
--
if
the
enterprise
succeeds,
pays
taxes
on
his
--
on
his
profits
as
capital
gains
but
if
the
corporation
fails
he
gets
an
ordinary
loss
deduction.
now,
we're
not
arguing
--
we're
not
presenting
that
as
an
argument
on
the
merits
but
i
think
it
bears
on
the
reasoning
of
those
--
on
the
reasoning
of
those
opinions,
which
to
some
extent
suggest
that
it's
unrealistic
to
treat
a
debt
which
is
worthless
when
acquired
as
a
debt.
i
think
this
case
is
an
illustration
of
the
proposition
that
what
in
a
--
in
a
particular
case
may
seem
to
be
inequitable
for
a
particular
taxpayer
and
produces
the
decision
in
his
favor
may
result
in
a
rule
which
is
a
applied
to
other
taxpayers
is
inequitable.
mr.
putnam
is
--
as
out
of
pocket
this
$9000
and
he
certainly
should
be
given
a
deduction
for
it
but
to
--
to
say
that
he
is
entitled
to
a
deduction
for
--
as
an
ordinarily
loss,
what
it
seems
to
us
introducing
to
the
statute
something
that
isn't
fair.
it
will
--
will
result
in
incongruities.
the
government's
argument
here
in
a
sense
is
a
technical
one
because
we
do
rely
upon
the
doctrine
of
subrogation,
which
might
be
thought
of
as
a
legal
fiction.
but
it
isn't
--
it
isn't
a
fiction
at
all
in
the
sense
that
the
loss
here
arises
from
what
originally
was
a
debt.
mr.
putnam's
loss
arose
from
the
fact
that
he
was
a
surety
on
his
debt.
it
was
the
debt
which
gives
rise
to
his
loss
and
it
seems
that
the
debt
should
give
rise
to
his
deduction.
mr.
philip
elman
he
--
not
only
that
sir,
before
he
paid
on
his
guaranty
of
course
as
a
surety.
he
had
a
right
of
exoneration.
a
surety's
rights
are
not
limited
to
subrogation,
they
extend
to
exoneration,
to
reimbursement
of
their
co-sureties.
he
has
right
of
contribution.
all
those
rights
spring
from
the
debt.
this
is
a
debt
transaction
in
its
essence
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
--
what
was
the
set
of
law
prior
to
the
pollak
case
in
1954
was
right,
that
a
guarantor's
loss,
arising
from
debt
is
a
bad
debt
loss.
now,
mr.
williams
has
mentioned
the
eckert
case
in
283
u.s.
that
was
--
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir,
but
he
points
out
on
page
8
of
his
brief
that
the
tax
court
pointed
out
that
sections
23
(e)
and
23
(k)
were
mutually
exclusive.
and
he
has
not
challenged
that,
and
he
couldn't
challenge
it
under
the
--
under
the
authorities
--
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
so
that
--
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
but
if
it
comes
under
--
if
it
comes
under
23
(k),
it's
--
there's
a
general
provision
and
there's
a
specific
provision.
and
in
the
spring
city
case,
this
court,
an
opinion
by
chief
justice
hughes,
held
that
this
--
this
specific
provision
control,
just
as
there's
a
conflict
between
the
general
statute
and
the
specific
statute.
so
that
if
--
if
this
is
a
bad
debt
then
23
(e)
controls
and
i
think
that
is
--
that's
the
premise
on
which
this
whole
case
is
proceeded
and
there
has
been
no
dispute
as
to
it.
mr.
philip
elman
precisely.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
but
as
a
qualification
to
the
vice
versa,
the
--
mr.
philip
elman
the
--
the
23
(k),
the
specific
one,
so
that
you
first
ask
yourself
the
question,
does
it
come
under
23
(k)?
it
doesn't
come
under
the
specific
one.
it's
--
it's
only
if
it
doesn't
come
under,
if
it's
not
a
loss
arising
from
a
debt,
then
23
(e)
applies.
now,
i
believe
that
your
honor
will
find
that
--
the
preposition
i've
asserted
in
fact
is
not
--
not
another
one
--
mr.
philip
elman
the
--
the
difference
arise
--
arises
simply
from
the
fact
that
23
(k),
the
specific
one,
dealing
specifically
with
debts.
congress
dealt
with
debt
loss
as
right
there.
it
had
the
general
provision
but
when
--
when
it
dealt
with
debts,
23
(k)
was
the
--
it
was
the
provision
that
congress
intended
to
be
governed,
it
should
be
governed.
now,
the
eckert
case
in
283
u.s.
arose
as
mr.
williams
pointed
out
when
the
statute
was
different
and
at
that
time
a
bad
debt
not
only
has
to
be
worthless
but
it
had
the
charged
off.
and
the
language
in
the
--
in
the
eckert
case
was
not
that
where
a
debt
--
debt
is
worthless
when
acquired,
that's
no
debt,
that's
not
in
the
opinion.
mr.
justice
holmes'
opinion
which
is
all
of
a
page
and
a
half,
does
not
say
that.
it
says
that
there
was
nothing
to
charge
off
and
he
was
repeating
a
statement
made
by
the
court
below,
the
second
circuit.
in
that
case
a
statement
which
was
subsequently
explained
by
judge
learned
hand
in
the
shiman
case
in
60
f.2d.
in
short,
in
the
eckert
case,
the
taxpayer
was
on
a
cash
basis
when
he
--
in
the
tax
year
concerned,
he
had
not
paid
cash
to
the
creditor.
what
he
had
done
was
substitute
the
corporation's
notes
in
which
he
was
secondarily
liable.
he
had
substitute
for
those
notes
his
own
personal
notes
and
he
sought
to
take
a
deduction
in
that
year.
and
the
--
this
court
held
that
the
cash
basis
taxpayer
has
to
pay
out
cash
and
when
it
--
there's
an
intimation
in
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
holmes
that
when
he
does
pay
out
cash,
he
is
entitled
for
deduction.
now,
that
provision
--
that
situation
arose
in
the
shiman
case
in
60
f.2d
that
judge
learned
hand
dealt
with.
