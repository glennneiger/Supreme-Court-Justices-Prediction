mr.
richard
e.
williams
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
richard
e.
williams
this
matter
is
before
this
court
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit
which
court
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
united
states
tax
court.
the
facts
in
this
matter
are
relatively
simple.
the
taxpayer
petitioner,
max
putnam
together
with
two
other
individual
persons
caused
to
be
formulated
a
corporation
known
as
whitehouse
publishing
company
for
the
purpose
of
engaging
in
the
printing
business.
each
of
those
three
individuals,
including
the
petitioner,
acquired
one-third
of
the
capital
stock
of
whitehouse
publishing
company.
shortly
after
the
incorporation
and
after
the
acquisition
by
the
corporation
of
the
necessary
fixed
assets
for
its
operations,
it
became
necessary
for
it
to
have
the
short-term
use
of
some
additional
operating
funds.
those
funds
were
procured
by
borrowing
from
a
bank.
and
the
petitioner
putnam
personally
guaranteed
the
borrowings
of
the
corporation
from
the
bank.
the
corporate
operation
proved
unsuccessful.
its
assets
were
fully
liquidated,
applied
to
the
corporate
obligations
and
after
all
of
its
assets
had
been
so
consumed,
there
remained
an
outstanding
liability
of
the
corporation
to
the
bank
with
reference
to
which
the
petitioner
had
executed
his
guaranty.
there
is
no
question
here
with
reference
to
the
actuality
and
reality
of
the
petitioner's
loss.
the
only
issue
is
this,
is
the
loss
suffered
by
the
petitioner,
a
loss
resulting
from
a
transaction
entered
into
for
profit
and
consequently
deductible
in
full
under
section
23
(e)
(2)
of
the
1939
internal
revenue
code.
or
was
this
loss
so
suffered
by
the
petitioner,
a
loss
resulting
from
the
worthlessness
or
the
fact
of
becoming
worthless
of
a
nonbusiness
bad
debts.
now,
in
the
lower
courts,
the
issue
has
narrowed
down
to
just
that.
it
is
also
recognized
by
the
parties
here
that
these
sections
are
mutually
exclusive,
that
even
though,
and
i
believe
it
is
conceited
by
the
respondent
that
it
is
a
fact
that
the
loss
did
result
from
a
transaction
entered
into
for
profit.
but
even
though
the
loss
so
resulted,
it
is
not
deductible
under
23
(e)
(2)
if
it
is
deductible
under
23
(k)
(4),
which
is
the
code
section
relating
to
the
deductibility
of
nonbusiness
bad
debts.
the
tax
--
the
taxpayer's
argument
as
set
forth
in
its
written
brief
is
also
relatively
simple.
mr.
richard
e.
williams
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
e.
williams
if
it
is
a
loss
within
the
purview
of
23
(k)
(4),
then
it
is
deduct
--
deductible
only
as
a
short-term
capital
loss.
whereas,
if
the
loss
does
not
fall
within
the
purview
of
that
section,
then
it
does
fall
within
the
purview
of
23
(e)
(2)
and
is
deductible
in
full.
the
taxpayer's
argument
has
set
forth
in
its
written
brief
is
also
relevantly
simple.
and
it
is
predicated
on
a
series
of
decisions,
which
are
cited
in
petitioners
brief.
the
cases
there
principally
are
the
pollak
case,
and
the
cudlip
case,
and
the
allen
versus
edwards
case,
and
the
ansley
case,
in
which
cases
--
and
the
fox
case,
in
which
cases
the
so-called
no
debt
theory
was
established
and
some
several
times
followed
by
various
circuits.
the
no
debt
theory
in
turn
is
founded
upon
a
decision
of
this
court
in
eckert
versus
burnet,
283
u.s.
140,
a
case
decided
in
1931.
now
it's
true
as
the
respondent
points
out
in
his
brief
that
eckert
versus
burnet
involved
a
different
statute
than
the
one
with
which
we're
concerned
here.
the
statute
then
did
not
distinguish
between
business
and
nonbusiness
bad
debts,
but
it
did
provide
that
a
loss,
as
a
consequence
of
a
bad
debt,
could
be
deducted
provided
it
was
ascertained
to
be
worthless,
and
provided
that
it
was
charged
of
during
the
year.
that
case
also
involved
a
loss
resulting
from
a
guaranty.
the
only
thing
in
that
case
that
is
of
consequence
to
us
here
and
i
think
it
is
of
major
consequence
because
that
case
is
so
heavily
relied
upon
by
the
various
circuit
courts
in
the
adoption
of
the
so-called
no
debt
theory
is
this.
the
court
in
eckert
versus
burnet
in
effect
said
that
a
debt,
worthless
when
acquired,
cannot
be
considered
to
be
a
debt
at
all.
in
other
words,
the
court
there
is
saying
that
a
debt
or
the
term
debt
as
used
in
federal
taxation
presupposes
something
of
value
in
the
hands
of
the
party
who
proposes
to
charge
the
debt
off
or
to
treat
the
worthlessness
of
the
debt
as
the
occasion
for
a
deduction
from
taxable
income.
the
no
debt
theory
actually
amounts
to
simply
this.
the
execution
by
the
petitioner
taxpayer
of
the
guaranty
itself
created
no
debt.
the
performance
by
the
petitioner
of
his
guaranty,
of
the
corporation's
obligation
to
the
bank,
could
have
freed
to
the
debt
only
if
there
were
at
that
time
some
reasonable
hope
and
expectation
on
his
part
of
recovery
from
the
principle
debt.
which
in
this
instance
and
in
the
factual
situations
embraced
in
the
cudlip,
and
pollak,
and
allen
cases,
which
there
was
no
reasonable
expectation
of
recovery
because
the
corporations
in
those
cases
and
in
this
one,
which
were
the
principle
debtors
were
without
assets.
they
have
no
means
with
which
to
pay
with
the
consequence
that
there
was
no
debt
because
there
was
no
hope
or
expectation
of
recovery.
also,
23
(k)
(4),
which
the
respondent
wishes
to
apply
here
requires
not
only
that
there
be
a
debt
but
that
the
debt
become
worthless
within
the
taxable
year
and
these
decisions
upon
which
we
have
relied
call
attention
to
the
necessity
under
23
(k)
(4)
for
the
active
event
of
worthlessness
to
occur
during
the
year.
and
of
course,
that
is
an
impossibility
where
there
is
--
where
the
so-called
debt
is
worthless
at
that
time
that
it
comes
into
the
hands
of
the
taxpayer,
as
a
result
of
the
performance
of
his
guaranty.
now,
the
respondent's
argument
here
and
i
want
devote
particular
attention
to
that
because
we
have
not
filed
a
reply
brief.
our
facilities
in
iowa
for
quickly
preparing
and
having
printed
briefs
are
--
were
not
adequate
to
enable
us
to
prepare
and
file
a
reply
brief
here.
and
for
that
reason,
i
do
want
to
devote
particular
attention
to
respondent's
argument.
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
respondent's
argument
throughout
is
predicated
upon
two
basic
and
continuing
errors.
the
respondent's
argument
is
principally
that
expressed
by
judge
stewart
in
the
cudlip
case
in
a
dissenting
opinion
which
he
filed
there.
the
errors
that
continue
throughout
the
respondent's
argument
are
these.
the
respondent
feels
to
distinguish
between
the
substantive
position
and
the
substantive
rights
of
an
investor
whether
he
be
a
lender
or
a
stockholder,
and
the
substantive
position
and
rights
of
a
guarantor
who
has
performed
his
guaranty.
the
respondent
fails
to
recognize
that
the
act
of
lending
money
or
the
act
of
purchasing
stock
create
thereupon
an
asset
in
the
hands
of
the
investor
or
loaner-lender,
whereas,
the
execution
of
a
guaranty
does
not
create
or
bring
to
the
hands
of
the
guarantor
any
assets
whatsoever.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
all
it
creates
for
him
is
a
contingent
liability.
he
does
not
have
an
asset
that
he
can
sell
or
exchange
as
is
the
case
of
the
lender
or
of
the
investor
in
corporate
stock.
there
is
no
value
in
his
hands
by
reason
of
his
execution
of
the
guaranty,
whereas,
there
is
value
in
the
hands
if
the
lender
or
of
the
stock
investor.
there
are
no
earnings
resulting
directly
to
the
guarantor
by
virtue
of
the
execution
of
his
guaranty
but
there
are
earnings
normally
inuring
for
the
benefit
of
the
party
making
a
loan
or
the
party
acquiring
stock.
with
a
result
that
the
respondent
has
failed
throughout
to
recognize
that
basic
difference
in
substantive
position
of
the
investor
and
of
the
guarantor.
mr.
richard
e.
williams
that
is
true
and
it
is
on
that
basis
that
the
execution
of
a
guaranty
and
the
lost
that
results
therefrom
are
treated
as
being
losses
resulting
from
a
transaction
entered
into
for
profit.
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
hands
of
the
guarantor
as
a
result
of
the
execution
of
his
guaranty
that
constitutes
an
asset.
there
is
nothing
that
he
can
sell.
there
is
nothing
that
he
can
exchange.
there's
nothing
with
which
he
can
procure
funds,
whereas
the
lender
or
the
stock
investor
does
have
an
asset
in
his
hands
from
the
beginning.
mr.
richard
e.
williams
who
does
sir?
mr.
richard
e.
williams
not
until
he
has
been
called
upon
and
has
performed.
then
by
subrogation
--
mr.
richard
e.
williams
i
didn't
understand
that.
mr.
richard
e.
williams
there
is
no
debt
here,
according
to
the
no
debt
theory.
mr.
richard
e.
williams
technically,
yes.
technically
--
mr.
richard
e.
williams
--
the
corporation
owed
him
money.
mr.
richard
e.
williams
it
was
worthless.
mr.
richard
e.
williams
i
think
perhaps
that
the
respondent
correctly
states
under
the
law
of
suretyship
that
the
debt
actually
arises
upon
the
loaning
of
the
money
by
the
original
creditor.
mr.
richard
e.
williams
yes,
sir.
and
that
the
ranks
of
that
principal
creditor
pass
to
the
guarantor
upon
his
performance
of
his
obligations
under
the
guaranty.
but,
and
i
want
to
call
the
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
respondent
finds
it
necessary
to
indulge
into
some
--
in
some
rather
strained
and
somewhat
thin
reasoning
in
order
to
please
something
of
value
in
the
hands
of
the
guarantor.
now,
of
course,
he
argues
first
that
it
isn't
necessary
that
there'd
be
value
there.
the
same
time
he
turns
around
and
attempts
to
persuade
the
court
that
there
is
value
there
and
that
argument
really
has
set
forth
in
the
footnote
appearing
on
the
bottom
of
page
19
of
the
respondent's
brief
which
i'd
like
to
read.
“so
long
as
payment
of
a
debt
is
guaranteed
by
a
solvent
guarantor,
the
insolvency
of
the
principal
debtor
obviously
does
not
render
the
debt
worthless.
consequently,
if
the
debt
which
a
guarantor
acquires
by
subrogation
becomes
worthless,
it
necessarily
becomes
worthless
in
the
hands
of
the
guarantor
rather
than
in
the
hands
of
the
original
creditor.”
now,
i
--
i
feel
that
that
is
rather
strained
reasoning.
it's
an
effort
on
the
effort
on
the
part
of
the
respondent
to
satisfy
the
requirement
of
the
statute
that
the
debt
or
obligation
must
have
become
worthless
in
the
hands
of
the
taxpayer.
the
statute
is
not
referring
to
the
occurrence
of
worthlessness
in
any
other
person's
hands
but
only
in
the
hands
of
the
taxpayer,
and
that
respondent
is
in
effect
the
same
when
--
if
the
guarantor
himself
is
solvent.
he
in
effect
can
owe
himself.
he
can
pay
himself.
and
as
a
consequence,
when
he
does
perform
his
guaranty,
he
acquires
something
of
value.
well,
it
obviously
is
a
fiction.
nothing
of
value
comes
to
him
by
the
fact
that
he
has
paid
off
someone
else's
obligation.
mr.
richard
e.
williams
yes,
sir.
that
is
the
first
time
that
he
has
someone
owing
him
anything.
mr.
richard
e.
williams
and
it's
true
there
is
a
technical
debt.
mr.
richard
e.
williams
he
knows
it's
worthless
before
it
comes
to
him.
the
assets
of
the
debtor
are
completely
gone.
mr.
richard
e.
williams
yes,
and
these
cases
--
mr.
richard
e.
williams
these
cases
that
involved
the
so-called
no
debt
theory
only
concern
guaranties
of
corporate
obligations,
where
the
corporation
is
without
assets.
that
is
the
only
place
in
which
this
so-called
no
debt
theory
arises
and
has
been
applied.
now,
congress
itself
has
very
definitely
recognized
the
difference
in
the
substantive
position
of
the
lender
or
stock
investor
as
compared
with
the
guarantor.
prior
to
the
--
prior
to
1942,
both
business
and
nonbusiness
bad
debts
were
fully
deductible
from
taxable
income.
no
distinction
was
made
between
the
two.
congress
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
many
taxpayers
being
in
a
--
in
a
situation
similar
to
that
of
the
person
who
had
loaned
money
were
being
restricted
to
capital
loss
limitations
with
reference
to
losses
that
they
might
suffer,
that
was
through
of
the
individual
who
owns
stock
in
a
corporation.
it
was
through
the
individual
who
owns
securities
as
defined
in
the
internal
revenue
law.
if
they
had
a
loss,
they
were
subjected
to
the
limitations
of
the
capital
loss
provision.
but
the
ordinary
lender,
the
nonbusiness
lender
was
not
prior
to
1942,
subjected
to
those
limitations.
in
congress,
in
amending
the
law
in
1942
and
establishing
the
distinction
between
business
and
nonbusiness
bad
debts
was
recognized
that
the
nonbusiness
lender
was
actually
in
the
same
position
and
category
as
he
who
held
a
security
that
did
qualify
as
such
under
the
law.
and
was
recognizing
that
the
so-called
lender
then
should
be
subjected
to
the
same
limitations
with
reference
to
deductions
upon
loss,
as
the
owner
of
a
security
becoming
worthless
would
be
subjected
too.
furthermore,
proceeding
from
1942
up
to
1954,
congress
in
1954
through
the
adoption
of
the
--
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954,
inserted
a
provision,
166
(f),
which
provides
as
follows.
a
payment
by
the
taxpayer,
other
than
a
corporation
in
discharge
of
part
or
all
of
his
obligation
as
a
guarantor,
endorser,
or
indemnitor
of
a
noncorporate
obligation,
the
proceeds
of
which
were
used
in
the
trade
or
business
of
the
borrower
shall
be
treated
as
a
debt
becoming
worthless
within
such
taxable
year
for
the
purposes
of
this
section.
but
only
if
the
obligation
of
the
borrower
to
the
person
to
whom
such
payment
was
made
was
worthless,
without
regard
to
such
guaranty,
endorsement,
or
indemnity
at
the
time
of
such
payment.
now,
note
that
congress
did
not,
by
that
enactment
change
the
situation
with
reference
to
the
ordinary
lender.
now,
certainly
the
loss
that
the
lender
suffers
is
just
as
real
as
the
loss
suffered
by
the
guarantor,
or
endorser,
or
indemnitor.
but
congress
recognized
through
this
enactment
and
through
its
failure
to
give
the
lender
the
same
benefits
that
were
being
extended
to
the
guarantor.
under
this
enactment,
congress
was
recognizing
the
difference
in
the
substantive
position
and
rights
of
the
guarantor
as
compared
with
he
who
actually
loaned
his
money
or
with
he
who
invested
his
money
in
the
form
of
stock.
now,
it's
also
true
and
i
suppose
it
should
be
commented
upon
at
this
time,
that
section
166
(f)
relates
only
to
guarantors
of
noncorporate
obligations.
that
poses
the
question
as
to
why
congress
selected
only
the
non
--
the
guarantor
of
the
noncorporate
obligation
to
extend
this
additional
benefit
to.
the
section
166
(f)
actually
arose
in
the
senate
and
the
senate
report
number
1622,
83d
cong.,
2d
sess.200,
stated
that
where
the
requirements
of
subsection
(f)
are
not
met,
the
taxpayer
will
as
under
present
law
be
treated
tax
wise
under
whatever
provisions
of
the
code
are
applicable
in
the
factual
situation.
in
other
words,
congress
again
had
no
reason
to
discriminate
in
favor
of
the
guarantor
of
a
noncorporate
obligation
and
against
the
guarantor
of
the
corporate
obligation.
but
congress
recognized
that
the
law
as
it
already
existed,
as
it
was
in
1942
and
was
from
that
time
up
until
1954,
did
give
the
guarantor
of
a
corporate
obligation,
the
same
benefit
which
they
now
were
extending
by
statute
to
the
guarantor
of
the
noncorporate
obligation.
i
assume
they
felt
that
was
necessary
for
this
reason,
if
a
corporation
were
without
assets
and
was
technically
indebted
to
a
taxpayer
there
would
be
no
question
as
to
the
permanent
worthlessness
of
the
obligation,
which
the
taxpayer
had
acquired
by
subrogation.
whereas,
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
obligation
were
owing
from
a
noncorporate
debtor
to
the
guarantor,
there
always
remains
the
possibility
of
future
recoupment.
so
congress
did
two
things
by
the
enactment
of
166
(f)
and
it's
very
clear
that
this
is
what
was
in
their
minds.
they
again
recognized
the
substantive
difference
between
the
position
of
the
lender
or
stockholder
as
compared
with
that
of
the
guarantor
and
they
specifically
recognized
and
gave
their
congressional
blessing
to
the
so-called
no
debt
theory
that
was
adopted
by
the
circuit
courts
of
appeals
in
the
pollak,
edwards,
and
ansley
cases.
now,
the
other
basic
fault
in
the
reason
of
the
respondent
in
his
brief
is
this
and
that
is
that
the
respondent
fails
to
recognize
the
presupposition
contained
in
23
(k)
(4),
that
there
must
have
been
something
--
there
must
have
been
an
obligation
having
value
in
the
hands
of
the
taxpayer.
not
in
the
hands
of
the
principal
creditor
because
we're
not
dealing
with
his
tax
problem.
we're
dealing
with
the
problem
of
the
guarantor
taxpayer
and
how
can
23
(k)
(4)
have
any
application.
how
can
there
be
an
obligation
to
become
worthless
unless
there
was
at
sometime
in
the
hands
of
the
taxpayer
something
of
value.
with
the
consequence
that
the
rule
of
eckert
versus
burnet,
which
first
established
for
the
purpose
of
federal
tax
law,
a
debt
which
was
valueless
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
could
not
be
deemed
to
become
worthless
in
the
hands
of
the
taxpayer.
but
not
be
deemed
to
be
the
basis
of
a
charge
off
under
that
statute
in
the
hands
of
the
taxpayer
remains
good
law.
it
has
been
followed
by
the
various
circuit
courts
of
appeals
and
has
been
recognized
by
congress
as
already
having
extended
to
the
guarantors
of
noncorporate
obligation,
i
mean
a
corporate
obligations.
the
same
treatment
with
reference
to
losses
as
a
consequence
thereof,
that
congress
extends
to
section
166
(f)
of
the
1955
internal
revenue
code
to
those
who
lose
as
a
consequence
of
their
personal
guaranties
of
noncorporate
obligations.
mr.
richard
e.
williams
the
--
all
of
them
except
our
own
and
those
circuits
are
the
third
circuit,
yes,
that's
the
pollak
case.
the
sixth
circuit
which
is
the
cudlip
case.
the
fifth
circuit
which
is
the
edwards
versus
allen
case.
the
ansley
case,
i
forget
which
circuit
that
--
the
third
circuit
was
ansley
also.
and
of
course,
there
is
also
--
it
involves
a
slightly
different
question,
there
is
also
the
fox
case,
fox
versus
commissioner,
190
f.2d
101,
which
arose
in
the
second
circuit.
in
which
they
held
that
where
the
principal
debtor
of
being
an
individual
was
dead
and
his
estate
long
closed,
bankrupt,
and
insolvent.
that
the
performance
by
the
guarantor
placed
nothing
in
his
hands
of
value
that
could
thereafter
become
worthless.
mr.
richard
e.
williams
yes,
sir.
and
that
was
the
point
i
was
making
a
while
ago
that
there
is
a
difference
with
reference
to
the
guarantor
of
a
noncorporate
obligation
because
he
might
thereafter
continuing
--
continuing
in
existence
recoup
and
be
able
to
pay.
mr.
richard
e.
williams
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
try
to
clarify
this
matter
of
23
(e)
(2)
and
23
(k)
(4).
as
i
understand
it,
the
respondent
does
not
contend
that
this
loss
did
not
result
from
a
transaction
entered
into
for
profit.
i
think
the
respondent
concedes
that
but
the
respondent
says,
that
since
the
transaction
was
a
bad
debt
transaction,
then
it
must
be
deducted
under
that
section
and
be
subjected
to
its
limitations.
whereas
the
petitioner
here
has
said,
it
was
a
loss
from
a
transaction
entered
into
for
profit.
it
did
not
result
from
a
bad
debt,
consequently,
the
deduction
shall
be
taken
under
23
(e)
(2).
and
i
don't
think
any
now
we
probably
should
have
pointed
out
that
there
is
a
23
(e)
(1),
which
relates
to
losses
resulting
from
the
operation
of
a
trade
or
business.
now,
this
loss,
we
concede
is
not
a
loss
resulting
from
the
operation
of
a
trade
or
business,
but
it
comes
within
that
second
category
of
losses
resulting
from
transactions
entered
into
for
profit.
i
had
intended
initially
and
neglected
to
point
out
one
thing
pertaining
to
the
facts
here.
at
the
time
that
petitioner
putnam
executed
the
first
of
two
guaranties
that
were
involved,
he
owned
only
one-third
of
the
stock
of
this
corporation.
at
the
time
that
he
executed
the
second,
he
owned
two-thirds
of
the
stock.
now,
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
if
petitioner
putnam
had
been
actually
the
controlling
stockholder
of
this
corporation,
the
time
these
guaranties
were
executed,
i
have
no
doubt
but
the
commissioner
would
have
taken
the
position
from
the
very
beginning
that
the
guaranty
actually
constituted
a
contribution
to
capital.
now,
being
unable
to
do
that
because
he
cannot
demonstrate
that
the
petitioner
control
the
corporation,
he
does
the
next
best
thing
from
his
point
of
view.
and
that
is
to
attempt
to
convert
what
is
not
a
debt
transaction
into
one
that
is
through
the
strained
reason
by
which
he
gives
this
debt
some
value
in
the
hands
of
petitioner
putnam
through
the
theory
of
subrogation.
he
calls
attention
some
several
times
to
judge
stewart's
dissent
in
the
cudlip
case
and
it's
true
judge
stewart
was
fearful
that
the
decision
of
the
majority
would
open
the
door
to
the
substitution
of
guaranties
for
actually
investment
capital.
but
let
me
point
out
that
the
commissioner
has
a
tool
with
which
to
combat
that
and
he
has
very
successfully
used
it
in
many
occasions.
and
that
is
to
look
at
the
substance
of
the
transaction
and
if
it
does
involve
a
contribution
to
capital,
he
need
not
be
concerned
as
to
the
form
of
the
transaction.
if
it
is
a
purported
loan,
if
it
is
a
guaranty
but
in
fact
constitutes
a
contribution
to
capital,
he
has
the
tools
already
and
he
has
the
decisions
by
which
he
can
have
such
capital
so
treat.
now,
there
has
been
in
--
mr.
richard
e.
williams
yes,
your
honor.
and
the
reason
why
we
contended
only
applies
in
such
situation
as
this
if
at
the
time
the
guarantor
performs
his
guaranty,
the
principal
debtor
has
assets,
then
he
has
procured
something
of
a
value.
now,
he
owns
an
asset,
which
he
never
owned
before.
mr.
richard
e.
williams
i
think
that
it
--
that
the
law
requires
this,
if
at
the
time
of
the
performance
of
the
guaranty,
the
right
acquired
by
subrogation
has
some
value.
then
i
think
--
mr.
richard
e.
williams
i
--
i
think
to
the
extent
that
the
right
has
value,
then
it
does
become
a
debt
and
would
thereafter
be
treated
as
one
to
the
extent
that
the
right
acquired
where
subrogation
does
not
have
value,
then
it
is
a
loss
that
resulted
from
the
transaction
entered
into
for
profit.
because
up
until
that
time
there
has
been
no
asset,
there
has
been
nothing
of
value
in
the
hands
of
the
taxpayer
that
could
become
worthless.
mr.
richard
e.
williams
well,
your
honor,
is
there,
however,
at
that
time
any
obligation
owing
to
the
taxpayer-guarantor.
does
any
one
owe
him
at
that
point?
and
can
we
have
a
debt
without
an
obligation?
mr.
richard
e.
williams
that
may
create
a
debt.
thank
you.
