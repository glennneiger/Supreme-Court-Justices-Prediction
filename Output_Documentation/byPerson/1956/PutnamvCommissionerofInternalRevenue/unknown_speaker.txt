that
--
doesn't
mean
that
it's
only
a
question
of
whether
it's
a
capital
loss
or
--
unknown

(inaudible)
unknown

the
guarantor
may
derive
great
indirect
benefits
from
this
guaranty
as
to
--
unknown
speaker
he
has
the
obligations
of
the
--
of
these
principles,
does
he
not?
unknown
speaker
the
--
the
man
who
guaranties
the
debt
of
a
principle.
unknown
speaker
that's
the
debt
if
he
loses
it.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
debt
that
your
client
lost?
unknown
speaker
what's
there
an
obligation
on
the
--
on
the
part
of
the
guaranty
--
the
person
whom
he
guaranteed
the
corporation
that
went
bankrupt?do
they
owe
him
what
he's
paid
to
that?
unknown
speaker
i
know.
unknown
speaker
what
--
would
that
--
that
--
unknown
speaker
that's
where
the
worthless
debt
arose?
unknown
speaker
oh,
the
obligation
arises?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
the
first
time
that
a
guarantor
has
someone
owing
him
something?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
that
defines
that
that
obligation
is
worthless
when
it
comes
to
it?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
not
necessarily
in
many
cases?
unknown
speaker
you're
not
bothered
by
the
word
become?
it
becomes
a
debt
and
becomes
worthless
at
the
same
time
that
--
unknown
speaker
what
--
what
--
unknown
speaker
it
was
a
loss
no
matter
--
whether
it
was
debt
or
not,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
are
you
--
are
you
also
arguing
on
--
that
is
a
section
2?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
bad
debt
can't
be
a
loss
that's
occurred
to
profit.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand
that.
i
have
a
loss
and
--
and
it
occurred
in
the
tax
court
as
i
understand
it
and
held
that
this
didn't
incur
in
the
business,
it
wasn't
business
debt,
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
well,
it
incurred
at
any
transaction
entered
into
for
profit.
is
this
--
does
this
fall
within
that?
as
i
understand
it
because
--
unknown
speaker
before
--
before
you
go
into
that
--
unknown
speaker
--
on
this
question
23
(e)
(2),
i
noticed
that
the
question
presented,
won't
they
--
on
page
2
of
the
brief
of
the
petitioner.
does
he
contend
there
that's
entered
into
for
profit
within
the
meaning
of
section
23
(e)
(2)?
unknown
speaker
and
on
the
--
on
page
5,
therefore
the
loss
suffered
by
petitioner
is
not
a
deductible
under
23
(k)
but
is
under
23
(e)
(2)
now.
unknown
speaker
of
course
(inaudible)
made
it
exclusive.
unknown
speaker
as
to
which
one
it
comes
under.
unknown
speaker
i'm
sure
they're
exclusive,
but
why
is
it
isn't
under
(k),
it
can't
be
under
(e)?
i
don't
understand,
but
don't
go
out
with
it
anymore.
