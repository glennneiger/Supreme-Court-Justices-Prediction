what
you
are
saying
is
that
the
category
of
23
(k)
(4)
is
an
inclusive
category
of
nonbusiness
debt
and
one
should
determine
a
debt
is
nonbusiness
as
the
end
of
the
matter
and
we
don't
ever
reach
these
many
pleadings.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
no
matter
--
let
me
give
a
next
question,
this
other
circuits,
they
rest
on
the
fact
--
do
they
turn
on
the
fact
that
this
was
worthless
when
subrogation
in
the
corporation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
before
--
if
you
acquire
it,
the
guarantor
comes
in
when
there's
still
a
chance
of
getting
something
that
in
the
next
few
month,
a
chance
(inaudible)
completely,
could
that
be
in
or
out
in
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
suggest
that
the
analysis
should
be
pushed
further
back
as
you
made
it
mainly
at
the
moment
that
he
signed
the
guaranty,
became
as
a
protection
to
subrogation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
your
contention
then
that
this
doctrine
for
which
you're
contending
applied
only
in
a
situation
like
this,
where
--
where
the
guarantor
pay
the
debtor
(inaudible)
the
debtor
become
(inaudible)
would
have
to
furnish
to
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
--
although,
before
the
year
is
up
of
being
paid
up,
whatever
(inaudible)
property
is
left,
it
becomes
worthless
and
the
stock
market
goes
down
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
wouldn't
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
relation
doesn't
begin
at
the
time
the
guarantor
paid.
it
begins
when
he
signed
his
name
as
the
guaranty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
--
the
debt
hasn't
become
purported
(inaudible)
but
legal
relations
that
come
into
being
