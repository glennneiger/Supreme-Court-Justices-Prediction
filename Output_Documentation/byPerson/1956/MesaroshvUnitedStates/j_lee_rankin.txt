mr.
j.
lee
rankin
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
motion
to
remand
this
case
to
the
district
court
for
an
examination
of
the
testimony
of
a
witness,
mazzei,
in
the
light
of
circumstances
that
occurred
after
the
trial.
we
have
set
out
the
various
circumstances
about
five
in
general
number
in
our
motion.
we
filed
this
motion
because
we
felt
that
it
was
the
duty
of
the
department
and
the
government
to
this
court
as
a
lawyer
before
this
bar
and
also
as
a
prosecutor.
we
think
the
court
is
entitled
to
know
why
we
delayed
to
this
date
or
the
date
that
we
made
the
filing
of
the
motion
in
presenting
this
matter
to
this
--
to
this
court
in
that
forum.
we
think
that
the
district
court
is
the
proper
forum
in
which
to
reexamine
this
testimony
in
the
light
of
what
occurred
later.
the
knowledge
of
this
matter
came
to
the
office
of
the
solicitor
about
10
days
before
the
motion
was
filed.
that
is
true
also
in
regard
to
my
colleagues.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
of
all
of
my
colleagues.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
in
the
solicitor's
office.
i
will
tell
the
court
as
to
how
it
developed
in
the
department
and
what
our
problems
were
with
regard
to
the
matter.
the
first
item
was
the
one
of
june
18th,
1953
in
regard
to
the
testimony
before
the
senate
committee
concerning
senator
mccarthy,
a
plot
against
him,
and
the
--
mr.
bortz
and
his
statements
before
a
communist
meeting
in
regard
to
handling
of
firearms
and
the
construction
of
bombs.
that
matter
was
developed
during
the
trial
in
an
interrogation
of
the
jurors
to
determine
the
effect
that
it
had
upon
for
this
--
this
witness
to
appear
before
the
committee.
it
was
gone
into
at
some
length
by
the
court
and
the
court
appeared
to
be
satisfied
that
it
did
not
affect
the
trial
of
the
case.
then,
we
have
the
further
incident
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
problem
in
regard
to
that
was
that
when
the
witness,
bortz,
appeared
before
the
committee,
he
stated
that
if
he
truthfully
answered
the
questions
that
the
committee
asked
him
in
regard
to
the
testimony
of
mr.
mazzei
before
the
committee,
that
it
would
incriminate
him.
so,
he
had
on
the
one
hand
that
--
the
statements
that
raised
the
real
problem
for
us
as
to
their
validity
before
the
committee
and
we
had
the
statement
of
the
person
who
was
involved,
mr.
bortz,
saying
that
any
truthful
answer
of
those
questions
would
incriminate
on
the
other
side.
and
we
had
the
question
then
if
whether
or
not
that
testimony,
being
known
to
the
court
and
the
jurors,
having
been
interrogated
about
would
be
such
that
it
should
reach
back
to
the
testimony
of
mr.
mazzei
in
this
case
about
the
connection
of
the
various
defendants.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
my
recollection,
would
incriminate
him.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
was,
if
i
understood
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
understood
the
thrust
of
his
testimony.
and
if
seriously,
it
casts
serious
doubt
as
to
which
one
could
be
right,
although
obviously,
the
statements
were
difficult
for
anybody
to
assume
their
validity.
but
the
court
did
inquire
into
them
with
the
jurors
in
this
case
to
see
if
it
had
any
effect
and
knew
of
them
and
examined
the
case
in
regard
to
them.
so,
we
felt
that
it
had
been
before
that
court
for
its
consideration
as
to
any
effect
on
this
action.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
believe
he
would,
although
i
don't
think
at
that
time,
the
department
doubted
the
veracity
of
mr.
mazzei
in
that
particular
testimony
because
it
had
the
testimony
of
mr.
mazzei
before
the
committee
under
oath
and
the
--
the
witness
involved
raising
a
doubt
as
to
which
one
could
have
been
right.
and
the
statements
were
as
to
what
mr.
bortz
told
mr.
mazzei
rather
than
what
actually
happened,
except
as
to
the
instant
of
the
communist
party
meeting
and
the
demonstration
of
firearms
and
bombs.
so,
it
was
--
in
an
area,
it
was
very
difficult
to
prove
who
was
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
at
the
time
that
they
learned
of
the
sheiner
matter,
the
testimony
in
florida
when
it
became
cumulative
of
all
these
things
that
had
occurred
and
they
reflected
back
and
we
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
only
sound
way
to
examine
this
matter
in
the
interest
of
justice
was
to
go
back
and
see
whether
or
not
in
light
of
what
occurred
later,
the
testimony
of
mr.
mazzei
at
the
trial
which
is
the
matter
in
point,
was
valid
or
credible
or
not.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
believe
that
his
testimony
in
that
regard
was
not
credible
in
light
of
what
happened
later.
we
do
not
know
at
this
point
whether
or
not
there
is
something
psychiatric
about
this
situation.
we
are
disturbed
about
that
and
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
why.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
some
of
the
testimony
of
these
later
events
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we're
going
to
frankly
present
to
the
court
below
the
fact
that
the
records
that
we
have
--
the
information
we
have
does
not
support
that
testimony.
that
the
fact
that
what
the
testimony
of
mr.
bortz
before
the
committee
which
he
said
would
incriminate
him
to
answer
the
questions
and
the
testimony,
and
present
the
whole
matter
for
the
court's
determination.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
don't
have
sufficient
knowledge
to
be
sure.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
my
personal
belief
is
that
it
was
not
truthful.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
was
for
several
weeks
as
my
understanding.
counsel
says
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
before
the
witness
was
presented
to
the
court,
his
testimony
was
carefully
appraised
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
supported
by
other
material
the
department
had
and
he
was
not
contradicted,
although,
witnesses
took
the
stand
after
the
defendants.
his
testimony
was
not
contradicted
at
all
and
that
was
one
of
the
factors
that
bothered
the
government
in
connection
with
this
subsequent
--
these
subsequent
events
that
have
caused
us
to
conclude
this
man's
testimony
should
be
carefully
reexamined
by
the
lower
court
in
regard
to
the
validity
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
because
of
what
has
occurred
since
which
ordinarily,
you
know
there
was
actual
perjury.
it
would
not
determine
the
validity
of
the
testimony
at
the
trial
but
they
need
to
find
what
the
circumstances
were.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
have
in
mind
the
procedure
that
was
followed
by
judge
dimock
in
connection
with
the
flynn
case
in
which
it
seems
to
me
the
court
would
examine
the
occurrences
that
relate
and
all
of
the
evidence
which
the
department
will
present
in
regard
to
the
files
it
has
to
the
court
for
its
consideration
to
carefully
determine
whether
or
not
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
this
man's
testimony
was
credible.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
did
fairly
or
whether
it
was
credible,
it
seems
to
me,
the
court
could
determine
for
himself
if
it's
something
that
he
did
not
feel
the
jury
should
even
consider
because
of
the
nature
of
the
testimony
and
how
it
conflicted
with
what
he
stated
later.
and
there
are
also
may
be
a
factor
where
the
court
by
a
careful
consideration
of
this
matter
would
determine
that
there's
a
psychiatric
element
in
this
man's
testimony
on
how
he
testified
in
the
later
events,
and
therefore,
it
should
not
be
presented
or
considered
by
the
court.
his
testimony
would
have
to
be
not
permitted
before
the
court
because
of
lack
of
competency
as
a
witness.
i
think
that
could
fairly
happen
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
except
for
the
matters
that
were
interrogated
about
like
this
matter
before
the
senate
committee.
and
the
court
knew
of
that
at
that
time,
it
was
brought
to
the
attention,
i
think,
by
both
parties
and
he
then
asked
the
jurors
whether
it
had
any
effect.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
at
the
time
of
the
trial?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
couldn't
have.
it
occurred
after
the
trial.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
they
haven't
moved
for
a
new
trial.
we
felt
that
there
was
responsibility
on
the
part
of
the
government
that
went
beyond
that
question.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
is
correct.
now,
the
further
fact
should
be
made
known
to
this
court
and
i
plan
to
make
it
known,
that
much
of
this
material
was
known
at
the
time
of
the
presentation,
the
motion
for
rehearing
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
defense
counsel
at
that
time
referred
to
some
of
that
material
and
urged
the
court
that
the
witness
should
not
believe
along
with
other
witnesses
in
the
case
because
of
it,
but
there
was
no
request
for
the
matter
to
be
returned
to
the
trial
court
or
to
have
a
new
trial
based
on
that.
there
is
a
--
as
i
get
the
threat
of
the
argument,
the
thrust
of
the
argument
was
to
suggest
that
it
should
be
considered
as
to
whether
or
not
the
defendant
should
be
acquitted,
rather
than
to
go
back
and
carefully
examine
the
testimony
and
see
whether
this
witness
was
credible.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
they
never
had
the
full
evidence
that
we
had
because
we
had
the
opportunity
to
compare
certain
material
that
we
had
in
the
files
in
the
preparation
of
the
case
and
other
matters
that
they
didn't
have.
they
drew
the
inferences
from
the
action
that
anyone
could
draw,
and
i
think
they
were
sufficient
that
they
could
have
moved
for
a
new
trial
if
they
wanted
to
use
it
that
way.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
they
do
not.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that
would
depend
on
what
the
trial
court
thought
should
be
done,
i
think,
in
the
conduct
of
the
case.
the
only
reason
i
would
suggest
that,
possibly,
it
shouldn't
be
made
available
to
them
as
that
in
this
whole
problem,
there
are
several
people
involved
who
might
get
hurt
by
a
public
hearing
of
their
connection
to
this
matter.
and
it
would
be
too
bad
and
very
unfortunate
if
it
wasn't
handled
so
as
to
not
injure
those
people
when
it
isn't
necessary
to
the
proper
end
of
this
problem.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
we'll
do
whatever
this
court
thinks
we
should
do,
but
what
i
had
in
mind
was
to
labor
for
the
judge
all
of
the
information
that
the
government
has
about
the
entire
matter.
and
then,
he
can
sort
out
and
protect
the
various
innocent
persons
who
are
described
in
the
files
and
should
not
be
hurt
in
such
a
proceeding.
and
yet,
give
them
the
benefit
of
a
full
and
complete
protection
in
such
a
proceeding
as
to
what
the
facts
are
in
this
matter.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
had
in
mind
that
certain
portions,
the
judge
would
handle
in
camera
so
as
to
protect
innocent
people
and
all
others
that
would
reach
into
the
merits
of
the
situation
would
certainly
be
handled
by
the
court
in
such
a
way
as
to
give
all
the
parties
an
adequate
opportunity
to
present
their
defense.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
is
correct.
if
i
may
say
one
word
in
regard
to
that,
i
feel
that
the
obligation
of
the
government
in
a
situation
of
this
kind
reaches
far
beyond
the
rights
of
this
particular
defendant
and
its
duty
to
this
court
and
to
the
country.
and
that
it's
our
obligation
in
a
situation
of
this
kind
to
try
to
see
that
justice
is
done.
i
believe
that
if
this
case
is
reexamined
in
regard
to
this
witness,
the
trial
court
can
properly
protect
the
various
innocent
people
in
its
procedures
and
has
the
skill
by
the
experience
in
handling
such
matters
to
determine
who
is
telling
the
truth
and
who
is
not,
and
whether
there
is
a
--
a
perjury
involved
in
this
situation
or
in
fact,
some
psychiatric
development
maybe
that
occurred
after
the
trial
or
after
this
basic
testimony
was
given.
and
i
think
any
court
would
look
at
the
testimony
and
think
that
the
witness
has
testified
and
nobody
contradicted
the
testimony
of
this
witness,
although
the
--
it
was
of
a
character
that
certainly
people
could
have.
there
was
other
--
there
were
other
people
would
not.
and
so
that
would
be
a
factor
that
i'm
sure
the
court
would
want
to
consider
and
examine
this
whole
situation,
try
to
determine
what
the
truth
is.
we
don't
feel
that
with
the
great
supervisory
powers
of
this
court,
it
has
the
power
to
watch
every
court
--
federal
court
in
the
country
that
we
are
busily
engaged
in
trying
to
develop
and
work
on
the
various
litigation
the
government
end.so
that,
we
have
to
do
what
we
can
within
our
proper
sphere
to
see
that
justice
is
done.and
whatever
this
court
thinks
is
proper
in
this
situation,
we
felt
that
we
should
bring
it
to
your
attention
for
your
determination
as
to
the
best
course
to
follow.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
not.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
it
reach
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
it
reaches
beyond
that.
i
think
that
the
government
comes
here
saying,
“we
have
doubts
about
the
testimony
of
a
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
feel
that
the
government
was
the
prosecutor
in
this
case
and
we
urged
this
case
and
the
conviction.
and
therefore,
at
anytime
during
the
trial
and
we
maybe
criticized
for
being
late,
i
think
it's
never
too
late
to
try
to
do
justice.
and
having
come
to
that
conclusion,
i
think
that
we
could
--
should
come
before
the
courts,
whichever
one
is
proper
and
try
to
get
a
correction
of
the
wrong
if
there
is
one.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
examined
this
testimony
to
determine
how
important
it
was
to
this
case.
and
my
examination
showed,
satisfied
me
at
least
that
as
two
--
two
of
these
defendants,
it
was
crucial.
and
in
view
of
that,
i
would
not
want
to
have
on
my
conscience
the
idea
that
they
were
convicted
without
testimony
that
would
support
their
conviction.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
--
i
would
think
you
should
except
for
this
question
of
whether
or
not
it's
a
psychiatric
condition
that
would
leave
the
court
to
conclude
that
in
fact,
the
--
this
testimony
was
valid
when
made
and
these
other
occasions
while
--
on
their
face,
they
throw
great
doubt,
cause
us
to
doubt,
are
not
sufficient
in
view
of
what
happened.
now,
the
reason
i
say
that
is
there
are
several
instance
here
that
do
not
follow
the
usual
pattern
of
--
of
perjury
for
someone
who
is
deliberately
falsifying.
now,
here's
the
testimony
about
this
bastardy
proceeding,
which
also
was
developed
in
this
trial.
and
the
witness
said
that
he
was
persuaded
to
--
to
plead
guilty
by
fbi
agent.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
was
during
the
--
after
the
trial
period.
he
said
that
he
was
persuaded
to
plead
guilty
and
he
tried
to
have
it
set
aside
in
the
state
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
so.
but
the
fbi
agent
testified
that
he
did
not
urge
or
he
has
anything
to
do
with
it
and
the
court
denied
his
motion
to
set
aside
the
plea
of
guilty.
but
then,
in
the
florida
incident,
he
repeats
that
same
statement.
now,
it
isn't
usual
for
anyone
who
is
deliberately
falsifying
to
--
to
repeat
something
in
identical
terms
in
that
way,
it
seems
to
us.
usually,
he
changes
the
story
a
little
bit
after
he's
been
caught
to
try
to
adapt
it
to
the
situation
in
the
hope
that
will
be
a
little
better,
a
little
more
palatable
the
next
time.
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
without
those
two
--
without
his
testimony
as
to
those
two
defendants,
i
do
not
think
they
could
have
been
convicted
and
the
court
would
have
--
had
to
direct
the
verdict
in
their
favor
at
least.
but
as
to
the
other
three
defendants,
there
is
practically
no
testimony
by
this
witness.
it
is
very
slight.
i
could
give
it
to
the
court
if
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
that's
the
point
that
the
court
would
--
it
seems
to
me,
the
lower
court
would
have
to
examine
the
situation
and
see
in
view
of
the
offer
being
general,
whether
or
not
it
had
an
effect
on
the
conviction
of
every
one
of
the
defendants.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
way
trial
courts
have
often
times
examined
the
weight
and
this
amount
of
evidence
with
regard
to
a
particular
witness
that
there
is
some
doubt
raised
at
sometime
during
the
proceedings,
either
later
or
at
the
time,
could
be
followed
and
that
the
trial
court
could
determine
the
extent
of
the
effect
this
witness
might
have
had
on
the
other
defendants
because
there
was
a
large
volume
of
testimony
in
regard
to
the
other
defendants
that
bore
directly
upon
their
participation
in
the
conspiracy
and
their
overt
acts
and
the
testimony
of
this
witness
was
so
limited
as
to
even
a
reference.
he
said
he
will
solicited
money
from
him
--
two
of
them
and
it's
so
slightest
to
any
direct
connection.
that
seems
to
me
the
court
would
have
to
weigh
whether
or
not
under
that
situation,
he
had
decided
that
there
is
a
doubt
in
his
mind,
in
which
case,
i'm
sure
he
would
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
he
says
--
right,
that's
what
the
court
would
do,
if
he
--
if
he
came
to
those
conclusions.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
the
only
thing
further
that
i
have
to
say
is
that
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
cannot
better
handle
this
matter
or
it
wouldn't
serve
any
real
purpose
to
examine
all
of
the
other
questions
in
this
case
when
this
particular
question
is
so
important
to
the
matter
of
justice
in
this
proceeding
and
that
the
decision
as
to
this
matter
by
the
trial
court
sent
back
to
it.
it
might
be
very
important
if
not
conclusive
as
to
whether
these
other
problems
ever
had
to
be
passed
upon
by
this
court.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
florida
incident
is
so
extreme
that
there
isn't
--
that
was
the
accumulated
part.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
he
testified
in
a
disbarment
proceeding
of
one
leo
sheiner
for
the
circuit
court
of
11th,
the
judicial
circuit
of
florida
in
miami.
he
then
said
that
he
was
induced
to
plead
to
this
bastardy
proceeding
by
the
fbi
agent.
he
repeated
that
same
testimony.
then,
he
said
that
he
visited
dade
county,
florida
on
behalf
of
the
communist
party
during
each
of
the
years
from
1946
to
1952
that
the
communist
party
in
miami
had
attempted
to
lease
a
bus
line
which
served
the
opelika
air
base,
that
in
1948,
the
communist
party
made
plans
for
the
armed
invasion
of
the
united
states
on
orders
from
the
soviet
union
and
that
he
and
mazzei
was
selected
to
go
to
miami
in
1948
because
it
was
a
c4.
now,
this
is
july
2nd,
1956
that
he
was
testifying,
that
he
took
courses
in
the
communist
party
on
sabotage,
espionage
and
handling
arms
and
ammunition.
he
was
taught
by
officers
of
the
communist
party
in
pittsburg
how
to
blow
bridges,
poison
water
in
reservoirs
and
to
eliminate
people.
he
discussed
with
sheiner
in
1948,
knocking
off
judge
holt,
a
florida
judge,
who
may
presumably
the
communist
party
we're
having
trouble
with
in
importing
one,
louis
bortz,
a
strong
armed
man
for
the
communist
party
to
do
the
job
that
he
and
the
communist
party
have
made
plan
to
assassinate
senators,
congressmen
and
even
went
to
washington
and
beat
up
a
senator.
to
his
knowledge,
schreiner
was
extensively
engaged
in
communist
party
activities
in
1945,
1947,
1950,
1951
and
1952.
none
of
his
testimony
at
the
florida
proceeding
is
supported
or
corroborated
by
information
in
the
possession
of
the
government.he
also
testified
that
he
was
--
went
into
the
army
because
the
fbi
asked
him
too
and
they
got
him
in
the
army.
it
only
took
a
very
short
time
and
i
think
a
couple
of
days
to
get
him
in
the
army
for
this
limited
purpose.
and
the
fact
is
we
know
in
the
investigation
that
he
went
in
because
he
was
under
the
selective
service
act.
now,
that
information
in
a
--
in
a
form
of
a
transcript
was
gotten
as
soon
as
the
department
could
and
it
came
to
the
attention
of
the
internal
security
division
early
in
september
and
they
then
tried
to
check
back
on
in
to
determine
whether
there
was
any
support
for
that
kind
of
testimony
in
whatever
the
government
have.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
we
would
have
recommended
that
to
the
court
if
we
had
been
satisfied
ourselves
that
mazzei's
testimony
at
the
time
of
the
trial
which
we
think
is
the
determining
point
in
the
proper
conduct
of
judicial
proceedings
that
it'd
be
reversed
and
go
back
with
--
because
we'd
feel
at
least
as
to
these
two
defendants,
there
was
no
basis
for
their
conviction.
but
it's
possible
that
something
has
happened
to
this
man
that
his
uncontradicted
testimony
was
valid
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
and
it
seemed
that
with
the
long
case
tried
like
this
and
the
jurors
that
involved,
the
trial
court,
courts
of
appeals
and
so
forth,
the
proper
way
to
do
was
to
send
it
back
to
the
trial
court
for
its
examination
carefully
into
this
question
to
determine
what
the
fact
is
and
then
assume
that
he
would
do
his
duty
which
i
think
he
will
and
have
the
case
handled
properly
at
that
point.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
one
of
the
things
that
cause
me
to
think
that
there
is
that
possibility
is
the
fact
that
no
one
contradicted
that
as
i
understand
the
evidence,
and
that's
his
testimony.
and
there
were
people
available
to
do
that.
and
the
--
senator
mccarthy
instance
seems
so
remote
from
whether
or
not
these
particular
people
were
engaged
in
particular
incidents,
detailed
incidents
of
the
communist
party
action
and
meetings
and
things
of
that
character.
that
–
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
didn't
--
it
wouldn't
determine
whether
or
not
the
witness
testified
credibly
at
the
time.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there
was
no
testimony
to
contradict
it,
as
i
understand
the
officer.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
at
the
trial
of
the
case,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
as
i
understand
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
--
i
was
talking
about
the
--
at
the
time
of
the
trial
but
there
was
no
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
case,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
i
--
they
didn't
have
an
opportunity
–-
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
to
appear
before
the
senate
committee
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
i
wouldn't
hold
that
in
any
way
against
them.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
i
do.
i
don't
know
the
reason
why
though.
that's
the
thing
that
bothers
me.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
i
think
there's
a
further
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
testimony
at
the
time
of
the
trial
was
credible
because
in
the
experience
of
courts,
there's
often
times
that
something
occurs
afterwards
that
clearly
shows
that
the
witness
as
to
some
other
matter
may
not
have
been
telling
the
truth.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
but
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
itself
--
well,
it
satisfies
me.
apparently,
it
didn't
satisfy
the
court
at
the
time
and
there
is
this
factor
of
the
other
witness
who
says
that
it
would
incriminate
you.
the
fact
that
that
is
a
factored
away
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
and
i
think
the
trial
court
should
be
able
to
do
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
i'm
going
to
try
to
examine
to
see
that
the
government
examines
exactly
what
the
situation
as
to
--
as
to
the
validity
of
the
testimony
of
this
first
--
this
very
witness
first.
then,
if
it's
determined
by
the
court
that
this
witness
is
not
credible
in
regard
to
the
testimony
he
gave,
i
want
to
help
the
court
examine
the
situation
and
see
what
the
reach
of
that
testimony
was
frankly
and
openly.
and
then
if
it
reached
into
the
other
defendants,
i
think
that
the
government
should
suggest
and
the
court
certainly
would
regardless,
determine
that
they
should
be
entitled
a
new
trial.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
won't
--
i
won't
say
we
will
do
it
to
prevent
anybody
from
getting
a
new
trial.
we
will
try
to
examine
it
fairly
and
we
had
corroborative
material
at
the
time
we
presented
the
witness
to
support
the
testimony
he
gave
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
and
unless
there
are
some
circumstances
that
the
trial
court
finds
that
justifies
this
testimony
later
and
separates
it
as
being
something
that
other
reasons
to
justify,
then
the
fact
that
this
man
is
falsifying,
we
are
--
we
would
contend
that
that
testimony
is
a
valid.
but
if
they
can't
separate
this,
the
trial
court
on
a
careful
examination
and
find
this
man
did
falsify
at
a
later
date
and
there's
no
explanation
of
the
psychiatric
nature
that
will
justify
separating
the
two
why
we
can't
support
that
testimony
and
certainly
wouldn't.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
--
and
my
recollection
of
that,
there
was
testimony
to
support
it.
but
there
were
instances
in
which
--
which
are
very
important
and
very
disturbing
too
in
which
he
testifies
to
conversations
that
he
alone
had
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
with
these
important
defendants.
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
--
it
also
testified
to
in
regard
to
meetings
generally,
but
these
particular
situations
are
ones
that
could
only
be
answered
by
the
defendants
taking
the
stand,
which
according
to
judge
dimock,
did
not
--
wouldn't
be
fair
to
them
and
i
agree
with
that
interpretation
in
the
application
of
the
law.
so
that
insofar
as
that
element,
if
his
testimony
is
found
beyond
truth,
well,
it
certainly
would
reach
to
those
defendants
and
might
reach
to
the
entire
matter.
is
that
--
that
the
answer
to
it?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
may
i
make
one
statement?
i
do
not
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
i
don't
want
it
left
on
the
record
that
i
believe
this
man
to
be
a
perjurer
because
i
think
in
order
to
commit
perjury,
you
have
to
have
the
intent.
and
that's
what
disturbs
me
about
this
whole
situation.
i
can't
accept
his
testimony
overall
these
events
as
being
valid,
but
whether
or
not
he
knowingly
does
it
with
the
intent
to
commit
a
crime
is
something
else
and
that's
what
--
where
i
can't
follow
through.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
but
i
am
disturbed
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
i'm
disturbed
about
whether
it
occurred
even
back
at
the
trial
and
i
think
the
trial
court
had
examined
it
that
carefully.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
certainly
seems
to
me
that
that's
a
very
peculiar
action
and
that
he
should
have
anticipated
even
if
he
want
to
lie
about
it
that
the
fbi
agent
would
be
there
promptly
in
testifying
to
the
fact.
and
--
so
it's
very
unusual
to
me
that
the
person
normally
wanting
to
falsify
would
do
such
a
thing.
but
i
think
the
trial
courts
have
examined
into
competency
a
good
many
times
and
do
it
everyday
and
should
be
able
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
was
confident
at
the
time.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
--
not
that
i
know
of.
