did
he
say
would
incriminate
him
or
might
incriminate
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
he
admitted
that
he
--
that
he
--
justice
hugo

black
--
admitting
criminal
offense?
justice
hugo

it
was
offered
against
all
of
them,
was
it
not?
justice

and
how
could
--
how
could
the
lower
court
--
i
want
to
say
that
i
--
i
approve
what
you're
doing.
i
think
i
agree
with
you.
it's
the
duty
of
a
prosecutor
to
see
the
justice
when
it
can
whenever
the
occasion
arises,
calls
for
his
action.
but
if
--
if
it
be
true
this
evidence
that
it
developed,
let's
assume
now
that
it
developed
that
this
man
is
now
known
to
be
psychopathic
perjurer
or
some
other
kind
of
perjurer.
his
evidence
was
important
in
connection
with
the
other
--
with
all
the
defendants.
why
isn't
the
jury
the
only
one
that
could
pass
on
the
credibility
that
would
--
why
wouldn't
a
proper
grand
jury
be
to
--
why
would
it
not
be
proper
to
reverse
and
remand
the
case
for
a
new
trial?
how
can
you
do
otherwise?
how
could
the
judge
pass
on
that
question
finally?
that's
--
that's
what
i
want
to
ask
you
about.
justice

without
encroaching
on
the
--
on
the
privilege
of
the
jury
to
try
cases
and
decide
whether
there
is
an
evidence,
is
such
or
the
person
is
such
who
gives
the
evidence
that
he
should
--
his
evidence
should
not
be
believed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
disclosed
to
the
doctrine
of
error
without
injury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
let's
--
let's
assume
now
that
the
evidence
is
of
importance
with
reference
to
all
the
defendants
and
the
case
were
remanded
that
it
is
of
importance.
the
court
reached
the
conclusion
that
he
was
or
has
been
established
since
that
time
to
be
a
perjurer.
would
there
be
anything
else
for
the
trial
court
to
do
or
should
there
be
anything
left
for
him
to
do
except
to
remand
--
to
--
to
set
aside
the
judgment
and
have
him
try
it
by
the
jury
to
confess
on
the
whole
evidence
with
knowledge
that
this
man
has
been
used
against
is
what
is
his
--
his
reference
to
be.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
evidence
was
important
and
that
the
man
was
a
perjurer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
--
may
i
suggest
that
it
will
help
me
if
you
would
state
what's
the
defendant's
position
with
reference
to
the
motion.
