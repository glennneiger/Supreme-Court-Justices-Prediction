justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor,
i
should
like
to
ask
you
just
one
question.
am
i
right
in
inferring
from
what
you
have
said
that
you
take
no
point
and
make
no
point
of
anything
that
the
defendant
did
or
didn't
do
with
reference
to
the
matter
that
you
call
the
attention
of
the
court?
you're
here
with
the
discharge
of
what
you
concede
the
responsibility
of
the
government
that
is
fully
unrelated,
either
to
the
resourcefulness
or
the
alertness
or
the
vigor
or
the
notion
of
higher
educational
status
beyond
the
part
of
the
defendant.
