mr.
frank
j.
donner
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
frank
j.

donner.
mr.
frank
j.
donner
i'd
better
start
by
summarizing
the
items
of
testimony
for
which
this
witness
was
responsible.
there
are
five
in
number.
three
of
them
are
private
conversations
and
two
deal
with
teaching
in
school.
the
conversations
which
involved
teaching
in
school
--
the
testimony
which
involves
teaching
in
school
attributes
to
the
petitioners
dolsen
and
careathers'
statements
involving
force
and
violence.
then
the
witness
said
that
these
two
petitioners
thought
that
the
witness
was
insufficiently
instructed
in
marxism-leninism
and
required
some
private
tutoring.
and
so
he
said
they
went
to
him
privately
and
again
told
him
that
the
only
way
that
we
can
achieve
a
revolution
is
by
force
and
violence
and
with
the
aid
of
the
communist
party.
and
curiously
enough,
the
things
that
he
testified,
they
said
to
him
privately,
not
only
deal
with
force
and
violence
or
are
almost
in
the
same
language,
that
is
force
and
violence
and
with
the
aid
of
the
communist
party,
as
he
says
was
used
in
the
school.
in
addition
to
that,
there
is
another
private
conversation
with
the
petitioner,
dolsen,
along
the
same
lines.
now,
this
is
the
--
the
evidence
with
respect
to
the
private
conversation,
obviously
could
not
have
been
contradicted
by
anyone
or
a
petitioner.
in
addition
to
that
--
and
here,
i'm
forced
to
disagree
with
the
solicitor
general,
he
testified
about
a
school,
but
he
didn't
identify
a
single
student
in
that
school.
for
all
that
could
have
happened,
that
never
--
that
never
could
have
been
said
and
the
defendants
could
never
have
brought
anyone
to
contradict
it.
there
is
not
a
syllable
in
this
record
to
identify
any
one
student
in
this
school.
and
so
first,
it
is
not
a
fact
that
the
evidence
with
respect
to
the
teaching
in
the
school
was
corroborated.
there
was
no
other
witness
who
testified
about
teaching
in
the
school.
and
second,
the
defendants
could
not
have
refuted
it
because
no
one
who
heard
the
conversation,
no
one
who
heard
the
teaching
was
identified
by
name
so
that
he
could
have
been
subpoenaed
and
brought
into
court.
so
you
have
these
statements,
all
of
them,
in
isolation,
all
of
them
made
under
circumstances
in
which
the
defendants
could
not
have
refuted
them,
all
of
them
dealing
with
force
and
violence.
and
the
two
dealing
with
the
schools
being
the
only
statements
in
the
record
dealing
with
what
in
fact
was
taught
and
advocated.
now,
that
--
mr.
frank
j.
donner
very
well.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
motion
involves
two
questions.
first,
the
question
as
to
what
is
the
appropriate
legal
procedure
in
connection
with
the
motion,
and
second,
whether
the
court
should
retain
jurisdiction
over
the
case,
and
here,
the
other
issues.
that
is
the
issues
that
are
presented
by
the
petitioner.
now,
with
--
with
respect
to
the
first,
we
contend
that
it
would
be
appropriate
on
this
record
for
the
court
to
order
the
dismissal
of
the
two
defendants,
the
two
petitioners
as
to
whom
there
is
only
this
evidence
which
is
now
tainted.
and
second,
that
as
to
the
remainder
that
in
order
a
remand
for
a
new
trial
because
there
is
no
question
here
that
you
have
a
situation
like
the
sacb
situation,
a
communist
party
case,
in
which
the
collateral
perjury,
the
collateral
falsities
of
a
witness
discredit
--
inevitably
discredit
his
testimony
in
the
principal
proceeding.
and
--
since
in
fact
the
testimony
was
admitted
against
all
of
the
defendants,
over
--
over
the
defendant's
protest,
so
that
there
isn't
anything
for
a
district
court
to
do
but
to
decide
an
issue
of
credibility
which
is
for
the
jury.
once
it's
recognized
that
in
these
collateral
proceedings
of
this
witness
showed
himself
to
be
an
unreliable
witness.
in
this
posture,
a
district
court
could
only
decide
the
same
thing.
he
could
only
say,
“well,
i
agree
with
the
government
that
he
was
--
he
was
an
unreliable
witness.
the
record
is
tainted
and
therefore,
a
new
trial
should
be
ordered.”
of
course,
there's
no
question
that
the
evidence
was
material.
they
all
dealt
with
force
and
violence
and
most
of
it
dealt
with
teaching.
so
that
on
this
record,
i
repeat
that
the
appropriate
procedure
would
be,
first,
to
dismiss
as
to
the
two,
and
second,
to
remand
this
to
the
other.
now,
i
--
i
too
feel
--
mr.
frank
j.
donner
no.
order
of
judgment
of
acquittal
as
to
the
two,
your
honor,
because
that's
the
only
evidence
asked
to
them.
there
is
no
other
evidence.
now
--
mr.
frank
j.
donner
for
a
new
trial
as
to
the
other
three.
because
as
to
dolsen
and
careathers,
the
principle
evidence
against
them
are
these
private
conversations
which
this
man
testified
to
contemporaneously
with
his
testimony
before
the
senate
subcommittee
about
senator
mccarthy.
now,
bear
in
mind
that
in
1953,
this
man
had
been
an
agent
for
the
fbi
for
11
years.
he
testified
that
he
--
that
he
had
made
a
room-full
of
reports.
the
fbi
knew
everything
that
he
was
on
a
position
to
report
about
the
communist
party.
so
it
can
hardly
be
said
that
the
government
was
completely
in
ignorance
of
the
possible
lack
of
credibility
of
this
witness
when
a
man
is
working
for
any
employer
for
11
years
in
one
field
and
he
doesn't
tell
them
that
the
communist
party
had
a
shooting
practice,
that
it
practiced
manufacturing
bombs,
that
it
had
a
rifle
range
in
a
home,
that
it
took
pictures
of
the
city
of
pittsburg
and
staged,
mocked
sabotage
raids.
why,
that
was
precisely
what
the
fbi
employed
him
to
do.
and
to
suggest
that
there
could
be
any
doubt
that
this
was
an
invention,
it
seems
to
me
is
rather
extreme
under
the
circumstances
of
his
relationship
to
the
fbi.
and
it
--
it
does
not
involve
merely
the
question
of
bortz.
bortz
was
one
individual
who
was
mentioned
in
the
testimony
as
the
alleged
finger
man
for
senator
mccarthy,
but
their
huge
plot
was
laid
out
involving,
for
example,
petitioner
dolsen
who
presided
at
the
meeting
where
plans
were
made
so
that
the
fact
that
bortz
pleaded
the
fifth
amendment,
horribly
explains
the
government's
satisfaction
with
that
testimony
because
as
i
say,
it
covered
far
more
than
bortz.
now,
i
also
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
this
testimony,
and
the
solicitor
has
pointed
it
out
in
his
motion,
that
the
court
of
appeals
referred
to
this
testimony
not
once
but
twice.
once,
in
connection
with
a
discussion
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
and
another
occasion,
in
connection
with
a
discussion
of
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence.so
that
there
is
no
question
that
the
evidence
loomed
large
in
this
case.
there
were
only
five
witnesses
and
this
--
this
witness
testified
about
in
his
conclusory
way
about
force
and
violence
in
such
a
way
that
he
couldn't
have
failed
to
impress
both
the
court
and
the
jury.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
could
--
the
testimony
is
only
54
pages
long.
the
court
can
read
it
and
you
can't
help
reading
it
but
what
--
but
what
--
but
inevitably
come
to
the
conclusion
that
this
witness
made
the
case
for
the
government.
he
was
the
force
and
violence
man.
he
was
the
person
who
talked
about
shedding
blood
and
--
without
equivocation
on
this
bare-faced
conclusory
kind
of
--
of
statements
which
informers
are
told
to
give.
and
so
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
that
to
prove
now
whether
there
was
some
psychiatric
barrier
which
possibly
separated
the
testimony
in
the
trial
court
from
everything
that
went
afterwards,
seems
to
me
to
be
rather
irrational
if
i
may
say
so.
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
have
this
man
who
was
contemporaneously
lying,
he
gets
off
a
stand
in
this
case
and
then
he
gets
on
the
senate
committee
and
he
says,
"the
--
the
communist
had
this
huge
plot."
he
--
if
he
was
psychiatric,
he
must
have
suffered
from
a
form
of
schizophrenia
or
divided
personality.
but
nevertheless,
it
seems
to
me,
viewing
this
thing
in
an
ordinary
common
sense
rational
way,
it's
quite
obvious
that
the
petitioners
here
were
the
victims
of
a
perjurer,
a
man
who
lied
and
lied
boldly
and
without
much
skill.
and
so
--
and
--
and
this
is
particularly
true
of
course
with
respect
to
the
two
petitioners
as
to
whom
there
is
no
other
evidence.
mr.
frank
j.
donner
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i'll
do
that.
i'm
glad
you
reminded
me.
the
question
of
whether
the
court
should
hear
the
whole
case
in
order
to
determine
these
other
issues
really
involves
values
that
don't
impinge
on
petitioner
so
much
as
they
do
on
the
business
and
function
of
the
court.
now,
we
have
presented
a
number
of
questions.i'll
just
list
them
briefly.
and
we
have
presented
questions
about
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence,
whether
a
pre-1940,
pre-statutory
evidence
is
admissible,
whether
the
evidence
antedating
the
indictment
is
admissible.
we
have
presented
questions
about
the
comments
on
clear
and
present
danger
which
the
court
--
the
trial
court
engaged
in.
we
have
presented
questions
about
the
conduct
of
--
of
the
voir
dire.
now,
there
have
been,
as
the
court
knows,
14
smith
act
cases
tried,
and
they
--
these
cases
produced
characteristic
and
predictable
kinds
of
problems.
and
one
of
the
most
characteristic
is
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence.
that's
fought
out
in
every
case.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
--
that
the
court
has
a
duty
to
tell
the
district
courts
of
this
country
what
the
rules
are
in
smith
act
case
about
the
admissibility
of
evidence
because
--
otherwise,
regard
to
have
the
same
kind
of
confusion
and
conflict
which
it
seems
to
me
should
be
avoided.
in
every
case
for
example,
the
government
has
a
witness
named
john
lautner.
he
testifies
about
what
he
taught
in
a
school
in
1930.
the
defendants
object.
well,
importantly
to
say
their
testimony
is
competent
or
it's
incompetent.
it's
remote
or
not
to
remote.
but
in
every
smith
act
case,
john
lautner
has
testified.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
must
sometimes
say
whether
that
testimony
is
admissible.
that
question
is
one
which
will
continue
to
play
the
administration
of
the
statute
in
this
field
until
this
court
speaks
with
some
authority.
and
that
troubles
us
and
i'm
sure
that
it
troubles
everybody
who
is
going
to
try
one
of
these
cases.
now,
another
kind
of
problem,
"are
you
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
clear
and
present
danger
or
aren't
you?"
three
district
courts
--
two
district
courts
have
now
given
hearings.
all
the
rest
say
that
what
was
held
--
that
was
held
in
dennis
that
you're
not
entitled
to
a
hearing.
another
recurrent
problem,
there's
a
universal
national
feeling
against
communism.
the
climate
is
awful.
it's
hard
to
get
a
fair
trial.
what
are
the
trial
judges'
duties
with
respect
to
the
conduct
of
the
voir
dire?
does
he
have
a
special
responsibility
to
cure
the
prejudice
in
a
hostility?
how
far
must
he
go?
that
--
those
kinds
of
questions,
it
seemed
to
me,
which
are
polished
by
our
case,
have
to
be
resolved
sometime.
now,
i
don't
want
to
put
myself
in
a
position
of
saying
that
i'd
rather
have
my
day
in
court
today
rather
in
sometime
in
the
future.
but
i
do
feel
it's
my
duty
to
remind
the
court
that
you
do
have
these
problems,
and
i
think
the
court
can
solve
them
as
expeditiously
and
as
quickly
as
possible.
