stephen
mesarosh,
also
known
as
steve
nelson,
et
al.,
versus
united
states
of
america
on
the
motion
of
the
solicitor
general
to
remand.
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
say
a
majority
of
your
colleagues?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
of
all
of
your
colleagues.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
--
but
that
the
department
know
then
or
did
the
department
then
have
reason
to
doubt
the
honesty
of
that
statement?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
the
court
below
had
been
advised
at
that
time
that
you
doubted
the
veracity
of
mr.
mazzei
as
to
that
testimony,
do
you
think
he
would
have
acted
as
he
did?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
when
did
the
department
first
come
to
question
the
--
the
truthfulness
of
mr.
mazzei
in
that
regard?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
now
--
do
you
now
believe
that
mr.
mazzei
lied
at
that
hearing
of
the
committee
in
which
he
testified
to
the
assassination
about
the
post
assassination
of
senator
mccarthy?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
what
--
the
point
i'm
getting
at
is
when
you
get
back
to
the
--
to
the
district
court,
if
you
go
back
there
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
are
you
going
to
represent
to
the
district
court
that
this
testimony
in
your
opinion
is
untrue
or
that
it
is
true?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i'm
talking
about
this
attempt
to
assassinate
senator
mccarthy
or
the
--
the
suggestion
that
he
would
be
assassinated.
are
you
going
to
--
to
represent
to
the
court
below
that
mazzei
was
truthful
or
untruthful
in
that
testimony?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
you're
not
going
to
take
the
position
either
in
this
court
or
the
court
below
as
to
whether
mr.
mazzei
lied
or
not
in
--
on
that
occasion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
your
belief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
that's
--
that's
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
rankin,
on
the
question
of
--
of
whether
the
defense
moved
for
a
new
trial
on
the
basis
of
this
florida
evidence,
did
they
have
available
to
them
the
same
information
that
--
that
you
now
have
that
cause
you
to
disbelieve
the
witness,
mazzei,
in
this
connection?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
they
have
the
same
information
that
you
have
concerning
the
possible
untruthfulness
in
the
--
in
the
mccarthy
incident
that
happened
in
--
at
the
time
of
the
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
to
be
made
available
to
them
if
it
goes
back
to
the
--
the
trial
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
can
understand
that,
but
when
the
case
goes
back,
do
they
have
to
operate
in
the
dark
and
without
any
--
any
knowledge
of
the
facts
you
have
that
caused
you
to
disbelieve
this
man?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
you'll
try
it
in
camera
with
the
judge,
would
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
didn't
get
ever
to
the
florida
incident.
that
--
that
is
not
your
fault,
it's
because
the
questions
we
asked,
but
i'd
like
to
have
you
discuss
that
if
you
will,
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
mind
saying
what
he
did
testified?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
you
--
you
believe
that
the
testimony
he
gave
about
the
plan
to
assassinate
senator
mccarthy
was
untrue
and
that
was
given
at
the
precise
time
of
this
trial.
if
that
--
if
you
believe
that
was
untrue,
why
do
you
believe
anymore
that
--
that
the
testimony
he
gave
at
this
trial
was
true?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
was
the
--
was
the
testimony
that
he
gave
in
this
trial
contradicted
by
the
defendants?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
mean
the
testimony
that
he
gave
at
this
trial.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then,
why
wouldn't
that
be
subject
to
the
--
to
the
same
--
same
thing
that
the
--
his
testimony
before
the
un-american
affairs
committee
is
subject
to?
you
say
there,
you
--
you
didn't
believe
it
or
you
have
reason
to
believe
it
because
it
wasn't
contradicted.
chief
justice
earl
warren
over
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that's
my
fault.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
now
believe,
do
you
not
that
the
testimony
you
gave
in
that
florida
proceeding
is
false?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
the
only
--
the
only
thing
--
only
question
then
that
bothers
you
is
whether
this
testimony
which
was
admitted
as
to
all
of
the
defendants
was
of
sufficient
importance
to
the
others
except
the
two
that
it
directly
affected
in
order
to
taint
the
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
didn't
this
mccarthy
testimony
occur
precisely
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
it
was
in
the
middle
of
the
trial.
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
may
i
ask
you
this?
when
you
get
--
if
you
should
get
down
to
the
trial
court,
do
you
propose
to
argue
to
the
court
that
this
testimony
has
not
tainted
the
trial
and
that
--
and
that
no
new
trial
should
be
granted?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
reason
i
asked
you
that
is
because
in
your
motion,
you
stated
that
the
government
in
spite
of
all
these
other
things
still
believes
that
all
the
testimony
that
he
gave
in
that
trial
is
true.
now,
the
question
i
profound
to
you
is
this.
if
you
should
go
back
to
the
trial
court,
are
you,
in
spite
of
these
other
perjuries
that
he
has
--
has
committed,
going
to
represent
to
the
court
that
you
still
believe
that
the
testimony
he
gave
there
was
true
in
order
to
prevent
the
defendant
from
getting
a
new
trial.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
there
any
corroboration
in
the
record
of
the
testimony
of
this
man
concerning
those
two
defendants,
concerning
whom
you
say
his
testimony
is
crucial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that's
the
crux
of
his
testimony,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
they
--
that
they
proposed
to
do
violence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
solicitor
general,
i've
asked
you
great
many
questions.
i
--
i
don't
want
you
to
--
to
feel
that
i
cast
any
aspersions
on
you
bringing
this
here.
i
think
it's
the
most
commendable
thing
to
do.
the
--
the
only
question
in
my
mind
is
to
--
to
the
procedure
that
we
should
follow
whether
this
court
knows
as
much
now
as
the
court
below
will
know
and
based
upon
your
statement
that
you
believe
this
man
to
have
been
a
perjurer
in
these
very
vital
matters
affecting
the
same
subject
should
cause
this
court
to
act
--
act
here
rather
than
to
send
the
case
back
and
have
it
moved
through
the
courts
for
a
term
of
years
and
eventually
come
to
us
again.
that's
the
reason
that
i
--
i
was
asking
those
questions
to
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
certainly.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
you
have
any
information
now
as
to
--
as
to
when,
if
there
was
a
psychiatric
condition,
that
it
--
it
started?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
may
have
developed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
--
pardon
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess.
the
court
will
recess.
