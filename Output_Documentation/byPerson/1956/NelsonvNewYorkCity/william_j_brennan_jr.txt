and
no
proof
that
they
didn't
follow
up
the
other
details
of
the
statute
by
letting
you
notice.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
jones,
what
are
the
notices
that
you've
been
discussing?
are
they
the
notices
of
the
foreclosure
proceeding
or
--
or
water
bill?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
they
the
notices
referred
to
at
page
27
of
appendix
a?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
with
reference
there
to
--
before
the
day
of
the
first
publication,
treasury
should
course
a
copy
of
such
notice
to
remand.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
how
many
of
such
notices
were
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
they
found
both
notices?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
with
the
water
bills
or
separate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
jones,
did
you
say
whether
these
tax
bills
in
addition
of
the
word
arrears
or
the
amount
of
the
arrears.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
the
word?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
that
stamped
on
it
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
some
authority
rule
or
statute
or
which
specifies
that
form
of
indicating
arrears?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
it
the
sort
of
thing
that
alerts
taxpayers
generally
that
the
bill
may
not
be
all
if
they
owed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
it
did
not,
but
is
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
said
that
it
was
an
option
on
the
part
of
a
city
to
use
that
method
rather
than
the
one
it
used.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
jones
(inaudible)
he
was
bound
to
pay
up
what
he
owed
or
suffer
the
consequences
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i'm
suggesting
to
counsel
is
a
friendly
and
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
are
suggesting
you
can
reach
it
in
a
short
term.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
what's
known
as
a
strict
foreclosure
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
there
any
basis
upon
which
the
city
could
refuse
him
if
he
asks
that
--
makes
that
request?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
mean
if
he
asks
that
the
--
the
separate
parcels
be
separately
sold.
the
city
take
what's
owing
it
and
to
pay
him
the
balance
maybe
the
city
refused
to
do
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
--
that's
absolute
right
that
the
taxpayer
had.
