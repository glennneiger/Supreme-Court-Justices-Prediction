mr.
william
p.
jones
may
it
please
the
court.
at
this
time,
your
honor,
because
the
appellee
served
his
brief
three
weeks
late,
i'm
going
to
have
to
ask
leave
of
the
court
to
serve
the
reply
brief.
the
clerk's
office
informs
me
that
copies
have
been
furnished
to
the
members
of
the
court.
mr.
william
p.
jones
this
appeal
is
from
the
final
order
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
which
denied
the
motion
for
reargument
but
granted
the
motion
to
amend
the
remittitur
to
show
that
constitutional
questions
had
been
presented
and
necessarily
passed
upon.
appellants
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
title
d,
chapter
17
of
the
administrative
code
of
the
city
of
new
york
and
the
action
taken
by
the
city
thereunder
in
taking
two
of
appellants'
properties
in
foreclosure
in
rem
for
the
collection
of
delinquent
real
estate
taxes.
in
this
case,
appellants'
two
properties
worth
in
the
aggregate
$52,000
were
confiscated
to
collect
$887
of
water
charges.
the
statute
involved
--
provides
an
in
rem
method
of
collecting
delinquent
real
estate
taxes.
it
provides
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
water
charges
are
defined
by
statute
as
a
tax
lien
and
then
the
statute
goes
on
to
define
that
at
all
delinquent
liens,
tax
liens
shall
be
foreclosed.
however,
at
this
point,
i
take
occasion
to
point
out
a
significant
difference
that
water
charges
can
be
collected
in
persona
as
provided
in
code.
furthermore,
water
charges
can
also
be
collected
in
a
very
simple
way
of
turning
off
the
water
which
is
also
pointed
out
in
our
brief.
well,
the
statute
provides
for
the
usual
posting
of
a
list
of
delinquent
parcels
in
the
clerk's
office
and
then
notice
by
publication,
that
is
the
novice
feature
of
the
statute.
that's
the
way
the
action
is
commenced.
then
from
that
date,
the
defendant
taxpayers
have
seven
weeks
to
redeem
their
property.
if
they
don't
redeem,
then
the
statute
forecloses
them
forever
from
redemption.
it
then
provides
that
they'll
have
another
20
days
to
answer
it.
if
they
neglect
to
answer
through
inadvertence,
mistake,
oversight
or
any
of
those
reasons,
the
statute
directs
that
an
absolute
--
an
irrevocable
deed
issued
to
the
city
for
those
--
for
each
of
the
parcels,
that
accomplishes
a
confiscation,
a
barefaced
simple
confiscation
of
all
and
the
entire
value
of
the
property.
now,
in
this
case,
the
appellants
have
been
paying
their
real
estate
taxes
ever
since
they
acquired
these
two
pieces.one
was
a
--
a
piece
of
real
estate
in
brooklyn,
the
other
in
queens.
one
was
acquired
in
1934
and
the
other
in
1938.
the
record
shows
that
during
that
entire
period,
the
appellants
paid
all
of
their
real
property
taxes,
which
were
vastly
in
excess
of
the
amount
of
the
water
charges.
now,
commencing
in
1945,
due
to
the
unexplainable
behavior
of
a
trusted
bookkeeper
who
managed
the
clerical
details
for
the
office,
these
--
these
bills
for
water
charges
were
not
paid.
the
appellant
trustee
didn't
know
about
it.
he
was
being
presented
with
the
real
estate
taxes
in
vastly
larger
amount
than
the
water
charges
and
he
paid
all
of
them.
but
this
clerk,
this
bookkeeper
didn't
give
him
the
--
the
water
charges
for
some
reason.
in
any
event,
the
water
charges
commencing
with
the
year
1945,
were
not
paid,
and
it
is
for
these
water
charges
that
the
foreclosure
action
was
commenced.
that
keyed
it
off.
now,
the
statute
provides
that
this
foreclosure
shall
be
instituted
against
any
parcels
which
are
four
years
or
more
delinquent.
the
action
against
the
queens
property
came
first.
that
was
instituted
in
may
of
1950.
in
may
of
1950,
there
were
only
$72.50
worth
of
water
charges
which
were
delinquent
four
years.
those
were
the
only
charges
for
which
this
foreclosure
action
could
have
been
instituted.
mr.
william
p.
jones
$72.50.
that
property
was
assessed
for
$6000.
our
appellant
trustee
did
not
--
didn't
have
any
actual
notice
of
that
action.
nobody
sees
the
publication
in
the
--
in
the
newspaper.
you
just
don't.
it's
one
of
those
things.
he
didn't
see
the
list
posted
in
the
county
clerk's
office
in
queens
county
and
he
didn't
see
mail
notices
to
this
office
which
he
maintained
which
this
bookkeeper
is
also
concealed.
mr.
william
p.
jones
it's
conceded,
your
honor,
that
i
personally
found
here
notices
in
that
office.
the
record
says
that
they
were
found
in
the
office
after
--
long
after
this
property
was
foreclosed.
this
bookkeeper
had
concealed
them.
actually,
they
were
found
up
on
top
of
a
bookcase.
some
of
them
were
--
they
were
scattered
all
over
at
the
office
in
the
most
peculiar
way.
mr.
william
p.
jones
they
had
reached
the
office,
your
honor.
it's
not
conceded
if
they
reached
the
bookkeeper.
they
got
to
the
office.
mr.
william
p.
jones
i
don't
know
whether
they
came
in
the
ordinary
course
of
mail,
your
honor.
they
can't
be
found
in
the
office.
mr.
william
p.
jones
i
don't
even
know
that.
i
presume
they
were.
mr.
william
p.
jones
it
didn't.
there
was
--
there
was
no
envelope.
it
was
just
the
note.
mr.
william
p.
jones
your
honor,
all
we
know
is
that
--
is
that
those
notices
were
found
in
the
office.
mr.
william
p.
jones
that's
right.
mr.
william
p.
jones
that
--
that
was
the
address
given
by
the
city,
by
the
trustee.
mr.
william
p.
jones
yes,
your
honor.
this
--
this
procedure
is
--
i
think
it
was
in
my
brief,
if
you're
referring
to
my
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
p.
jones
that
was
the
statute
that
we're
concerned
with.
mr.
william
p.
jones
we
assumed
that
they
filed
that
--
that
list
under
the
--
pursuant
to
the
statute.
mr.
william
p.
jones
no,
there's
nothing
in
this
record
to
raise
that
point.
mr.
william
p.
jones
well,
that
may
or
may
not
be.
at
any
rate,
the
combination
of
the
--
the
way
this
bookkeeper
performed
his
duty
may
--
interfered
with
the
reception
of
the
notice.
mr.
william
p.
jones
well,
we
certainly
proceeded
against
the
bookkeeper,
but
he
turned
out
to
be
judgment
proof
of
course.
mr.
william
p.
jones
well,
we
thought
he
was
more
than
delinquent.
we
--
we
thought
that
he
was
an
--
an
embezzler
as
well.
at
any
rate,
we
got
a
judgment
against
him
for
some
hundred
thousand
dollars
which
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
i
have
mentioned
the
--
the
receipt
of
the
water
bills
which
were
found
in
the
office.
i
have
also
said
that
the
notices
of
the
foreclosure
action
were
later
found
in
the
office.
mr.
william
p.
jones
not
--
not
at
this
time,
your
honor.
mr.
justice
murphy
had
--
on
page
27?
mr.
william
p.
jones
those
are
the
notices
that
i've
been
referring
to.
mr.
william
p.
jones
there
was
a
notice
for
each
action.
there
were
two
actions
involved
here.
mr.
william
p.
jones
both
notices
were
found
in
the
office,
years
after
the
action.
mr.
william
p.
jones
the
water
bills
were
also
found.
i
can't
tell
you
now,
whether
they
were
physically
together,
but
water
bills
were
also
found
and
found
not
to
have
been
taken.
mr.
william
p.
jones
no,
your
honor,
and
they
didn't.
that's
one
of
the
peculiarities
of
the
city's
tax
method
that
the
water
bills
don't
show
whether
they're
paid
or
not.
mr.
william
p.
jones
that
appears
only
on
the
real
estate
tax
bill.
mr.
william
p.
jones
it
appears
--
the
word
arrears
appears
on
the
real
estate
--
real
estate
tax
bill,
but
--
but
it
doesn't
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
not
on
the
water
bill
nor
does
it
specify
on
the
real
estate
tax
bill
which
item
is
in
arrears
and
which
one
is
unpaid.
mr.
william
p.
jones
it's
that
is
the
--
the
nonpayment
of
the
water
tax
is
what
caused
the
word
arrears
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
--
to
appear
on
the
real
estate
tax
bill,
but
there
is
no
cross-connection
on
that
the
real
estate
tax
bill
which
notifies
the
taxpayer
what
item
is
not
paid.
mr.
william
p.
jones
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
as
a
meticulous
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
the
brooklyn
property
was
assessed
at
$46,000.
mr.
william
p.
jones
he
was
not
--
along
with
most
people,
not
too
thoroughly
informed
on
the
--
on
the
tax
billing
method
of
the
city
of
new
york.
mr.
william
p.
jones
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
no,
your
honor.
there's
--
there's
no
suggestion
of
incompetence.
mr.
william
p.
jones
this
isn't
like
the
covey
case.
unfortunately,
the
--
when
i
say
the
-
the
nice
point
in
the
covey
case
of
incompetence
is
not
present
in
this
case.
mr.
william
p.
jones
he's
a
trustee.
mr.
william
p.
jones
he
received
them
in
this
office
which
he
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
i
did.
mr.
william
p.
jones
that's
right.
mr.
william
p.
jones
that's
correct.
there
were
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
there
was
the
word
arrears
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
--
which
indicates
a
delinquent
tax.
mr.
william
p.
jones
they
did.
mr.
william
p.
jones
those
bills
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
well,
it's
not
a
notice
of
delinquency,
your
honor,
quite
as
sharp
as
that.
mr.
william
p.
jones
arrears.
yes.
mr.
william
p.
jones
nothing
other
than
pay
that
bill.
he
did
pay
that
bill
through
a
check
and
that
the
--
and
that
check
was
sent
in
and
--
and
paid
that
bill.
he
paid
--
he
paid
that
--
his
real
estate
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
there
had
been
no
indebtedness
at
all.
mr.
william
p.
jones
that's
right.
mr.
william
p.
jones
they
were
both
sent,
your
honor.
both
the
water
bills
and
the
real
estate
taxes
were
sent
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
--
and
--
and
marked
on
the
real
estate
tax
bill
was
the
word
arrears.
mr.
william
p.
jones
that's
right.
mr.
william
p.
jones
well,
he
saw
presumably
saw
the
tax
bill.
mr.
william
p.
jones
i
say,
he
--
he
presumably
saw
the
tax
bill.
mr.
william
p.
jones
now,
whether
he
didn't
see
that
word
arrears
or
not.
mr.
william
p.
jones
no,
this
was
brought
up
on
motion
by
affidavit.
so,
there
was
no
testimony
in
this
case.your
honor?
mr.
william
p.
jones
he
paid
the
tax
bill.
mr.
william
p.
jones
that's
right.
he
paid
the
tax
bill
in
full.
mr.
william
p.
jones
that's
correct.
mr.
william
p.
jones
he
paid
a
current
tax
bill.
mr.
william
p.
jones
it
was
not
in
arrears,
no.
mr.
william
p.
jones
that
is
correct.
it
meant
nothing
to
him
because
he
had
been
paying
all
of
his
real
estate
taxes
and
that
he
knew.
mr.
william
p.
jones
no,
several
bills.
mr.
william
p.
jones
a
series.
mr.
william
p.
jones
that's
right,
a
series
over
years.
mr.
william
p.
jones
well,
he
disregards
it
because
it
--
i
suppose
an
ordinary
man
might
say,
“over
here.
what
does
this
mean?
i
keep
paying
my
current
bill
and
these
arrears
are
never
explained.”
mr.
william
p.
jones
there
--
there
is
not.
no.
mr.
william
p.
jones
except
what
he
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
p.
jones
the
record
shows
that
that
there
were
other
properties.
mr.
william
p.
jones
that's
correct.
and
--
and
as
a
part
of
administering
this
rather
substantial
property
in
real
estate,
he
had
a
reputable
real
estate
agent
managing
the
properties.
they
were
seven
at
that
time
which
he
operated.
a
real
estate
agent
kept
them
maintained,
painted,
repaired,
the
rents
collectively,
and
remitted
to
him
the
rent.
his
tax
bills
however
came
to
a
--
a
little
administrative
office
which
he
maintained
separate
and
apart
from
his
real
estate
managing
agent.
mr.
william
p.
jones
they
--
yes,
sir.
they
came
to
that
office
and
he
would
come
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
they
were.
mr.
william
p.
jones
they
were.
he
would
--
because
he
would
go
to
that
office
two
or
three
--
two
or
three
hours
a
week
and
this
bookkeeper
would
present
him
with
the
bills
to
be
paid
and
he
would
write
the
checks
out
for
the
payment
of
these
various
tax
bills.
mr.
william
p.
jones
that's
right.
he
did
not
leave
that
to
the
real
estate
agent.
mr.
william
p.
jones
well,
he
owes
this
money
because
there's
an
unsatisfied
judgment
against
him.
mr.
william
p.
jones
that's
correct.
that's
right.
mr.
william
p.
jones
no,
your
honor.
he
never
took
commissions.
mr.
william
p.
jones
no,
your
honor,
they
did
not.
mr.
william
p.
jones
just
a
word,
the
one
word,
arrears.
mr.
william
p.
jones
it
was
high
printed,
i
think
or
it
was
just
a
draft.at
any
rate,
it
appeared
on
there
by
one
word,
arrears.
it
didn't
say
how
much.
it
didn't
say
what
item,
what
year,
what
category
the
charge
was,
whether
it
was
a
water
charge,
a
sewer
assessment,
a
painting
assessment.
mr.
william
p.
jones
that's
right.
that's
--
that
--
that
is
the
pursuant
to
the
--
to
the
tax
portion
of
the
new
york
city
administrative
code.
mr.
william
p.
jones
it
didn't
alert
this
taxpayer.
mr.
william
p.
jones
that's
the
way
the
city
does
it.
there
are
--
have
to
prove
your
question
your
honor.
there
are
great
many
other
taxpayers
who
haven't
been
alerted
by
that
method
either.
mr.
william
p.
jones
that's
correct.
mr.
william
p.
jones
father
and
son.
mr.
william
p.
jones
yes.
mr.
william
p.
jones
there'll
be
no
point
that's
made
of
the
fact
that
he
didn't
take
permission.
mr.
william
p.
jones
it
was
not.
it
is
for
a
current
tax.
mr.
william
p.
jones
which
is
unpaid.
mr.
william
p.
jones
in
fact,
it
couldn't
have,
no.
whether
he
knew
that
at
the
time,
he
--
he
believed
as
he
many
times
said
that
why
i
paid
all
my
taxes
and
that
was
true.
we
went
and
checked
the
record
and
--
and
since
1934
and
in
one
case
in
1938
and
the
other,
he
had
an
unbroken
record
of
paying
the
real
estate
taxes.
there
was
one
exception.
a
half
year's
tax
for
the
year
1948,
1949,
real
estate
tax
was
not
paid.
now,
that
is
an
--an
inadvertence
just
like
the
water
charges,
but
other
than
that,
which
doesn't
figure
in
these
cases
because
that
one
was
not
four
years
old
and
couldn't
key
off
this
in
rem
statute.
the
real
estate
record
is
unbroken.
mr.
william
p.
jones
well,
now,
that
can
bring
us
directly
to
what
i
believe
is
the
--
is
the
key
in
the
case,
acquainted
with
generally
with
the
in
rem
type
method
of
foreclosing
real
estate
taxes.
those
statutes
exist
in
many
states.
one
of
the
ordinary
elements
is
publication
by
notice,
no
return
by
a
publication,
commencing
the
action
by
filing
a
list
of
delinquent
taxes
in
the
county
clerk's
office
or
the
county
auditor's
office
copy
with
publication
in
a
--
in
a
newspaper
and
possibly
followed
by
a
mail
notice.
now,
that
is
the
ordinary
way.
mr.
william
p.
jones
because
all
of
the
statutes
don't
require
the
mailing
of
the
notice.
mr.
william
p.
jones
that's
right.
that's
the
--
that's
the
kickoff
point,
your
honor.
the
filing
of
that
list
in
a
county
clerk's
office
commences
the
action
and
then
he
has
to
publish
in
a
local
newspaper.
and
then,
he
is
told
to
mail
a
notice
if
he
knows
the
address.
now
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
that
is
further
along
in
that
same
section.
mr.
william
p.
jones
mr.
justice
burton
put
his
hand
on
it
there.
trader
shall
post
a
copy
of
such
notice
to
be
mailed
to
the
last
known
address
of
each
property
affected
thereby.
mr.
william
p.
jones
that's
on
the
top
of
page
27
in
my
brief,
appendix
a.
mr.
william
p.
jones
if
he
doesn't
know
the
address,
he
doesn't
have
to
mail
that
notice.
mr.
william
p.
jones
that's
correct.
mr.
william
p.
jones
well,
he
--
he
did
in
this
case
because
this
record
shows
that
--
that
he
had
what
he
--
what
he
believed
was
the
address
of
the
taxpayer.
so,
he
mailed
these
notices.
mr.
william
p.
jones
right.
mr.
william
p.
jones
he
never
had
actual
note.
he
didn't
get
it.
mr.
william
p.
jones
it
got
to
the
office.
that's
right.
mr.
william
p.
jones
he
got
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
p.
jones
that's
right.
the
record
show
that
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
that's
right.
however
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
the
record
shows,
your
honor,
that
--
and
it's
never
been
denied
that
the
taxpayer
never
had
actual
notice.
that
--
that
has
been
undenied
in
the
record.
mr.
william
p.
jones
no,
i'm
not
--
i
was
just
about
to
get
to
what
i
consider
the
point
here.
the
--
i
was
reviewing
very
briefly
the
in
rem
general
type
of
the
in
rem
statute
which
brought
--
was
brought
on
by
--
by
published
notice
and
--
and
the
list
posted.
the
other
element
of
the
in
rem
proceeding
is
that
a
judgment
those
against
the
property
itself
dispensing
with
any
personam
process
or
any
personam
collection
or
any
personam
liability.
but
then
this
is
where
they
diverge
and
why
this
statute
involved
is
--
is
novel,
unique,
and
the
question
brought
here
today
we
think
is
a
--
a
new
question
presented
to
this
court
for
the
first
time.
most
of
the
other
in
rem
statutes
provide
that
there
be
a
sale
of
the
property
to
collect
the
tax
and
that
the
surplus
goes
to
the
owner.
mr.
william
p.
jones
well,
but
there's
the
sale
and
--
and
it
exposes
the
property
to
a
--
a
fair
objective
sale
in
which
there's
a
strong
possibility
that
there
will
be
surplus
for
the
owner.
at
least
he's
got
that,
and
that's
the
minimum
that
we
say
he
can
insist
on,
all
right.
mr.
william
p.
jones
there
was
an
option,
an
option
under
another
section
of
their
code
title
a,
but
this
particular,
now,
this
is
where
the
city
statute
is
unique
and
novel.
it
doesn't
order
a
surplus
sale.
in
fact,
it
orders
and
directs
that
there
be
no
surplus
sale,
but
that
there
be
a
confiscation
of
the
entire
property.
mr.
william
p.
jones
that's
correct.
it
doesn't
--
it
cuts
off
all
of
the
owner's
equity
in
the
surplus.
mr.
william
p.
jones
well,
it's
not
--
it's
an
opportunity
to
redeem.
it
isn't
actually
an
equity
redemption.it's
a
chance
to
pay
your
taxes,
an
opportunity
you
have
for
seven
weeks
after
that
list
is
filed.
then,
you've
got
another
20
days
to
answer
and
if
you
inadvertently
miss
them
both,
the
statute
orders
an
absolute
deed
executed
to
the
city
or
irrevocable
deed
for
that
entire
property.
mr.
william
p.
jones
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
no,
sir.
i
insist
that's
not
an
equity
of
redemption
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
--
that
takes
an
opportunity
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
--
you
can't
get
the
property
there's
--
what
if
you
can't
pay
your
taxes
then?
mr.
william
p.
jones
well,
yes
if
that's
due.
if
he
sees
--
if
he
does
get
notice,
yes.
i
mean,
if
he
--
if
he
gets
the
notice.
mr.
william
p.
jones
i'm
suggesting
this,
your
honor,
that
there's
no
case
that
i
can
find
that's
been
decided
by
this
court,
which
upholds
an
in
rem
statute
with
a
confiscatory
feature
with
a
speedy
confiscatory
feature
like
this
one.
mr.
william
p.
jones
it's
not
the
period.
it's
the
fact
that
there
has
been
a
confiscation
for
the
--
in
lieu
of
the
collection
of
the
tax.
it's
the
taking
the
entire
property,
instead
of
confining
the
tax
authority
to
collecting
its
just
tax.
now,
that
brings
me
to
the
case
that's
cited
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
by
a
sale
of
property.
mr.
william
p.
jones
well,
that's
fine.
mr.
william
p.
jones
well,
that's
all
right.
if
that
happens,
that
certainly
--
we
say
that
the
taxpayer,
if
that
happens
to
him,
it's
--
it's
hard
luck,
but
at
least,
he's
had
the
benefit
of
a
sale
which
might
produce
surplus
in
return
for
his
equity
in
the
property.
mr.
william
p.
jones
and
not
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
that
is
the
key
to
it,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
jones
that
was
the
later
point
which
i
--
i
would
like
to
come
to,
but
this
--
if
i
can
develop
this
point
mr.
justice
reed
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
--
which,
like
eerie
--
you
put
your
finger
on
it
precisely
that
it
is
the
taking
the
whole
property
without
a
sale.
that
is
the
wrong
thing.
now,
these
cases
that
--
that
the
appellee
cites
in
support
of
this
statute
don't
involve
statutes
like
that.
they
involve
--
now,
the
wynonna
case
involving
the
minnesota
statute,
that
minnesota
statute
precisely
directs
that
there
be
a
surplus
sale
and
that
the
tax
authority
gets
out
of
the
property
only
the
amount
of
its
tax
and
the
proceeds
from
the
sale
is
surplus
to
the
tax
go
for
the
benefit
of
the
owner.
that's
why
it's
so
different
from
this
statute
and
that
--
that's
where
this
statute
diverges
and
why
it's
such
a
--
a
rudely
tough
statute
on
the
--
on
the
individual
rights
of
a
property
owner.
mr.
william
p.
jones
now
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
right.
mr.
william
p.
jones
right.
when
this
--
when
the
statute
--
when
this
--
this
action
has
begun,
it
--
it
is
the
--
precisely,
it's
not
a
problem
of
getting
the
surplus.
it's
simply
a
--
a
further
time
that
he
can
pay
the
taxes
due
and
he
still
retains
everything
he
had
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
--
before.
mr.
william
p.
jones
that's
right.
mr.
william
p.
jones
if
he
sees
--
if
he
gets
there
in
time.
if
he
gets
there
in
just
10
weeks.
mr.
william
p.
jones
no,
the
statute
doesn't.
mr.
william
p.
jones
there
is
publication
in
local
newspaper.
mr.
william
p.
jones
in
this
case,
brooklyn
and
a
queens
newspaper.
mr.
william
p.
jones
well,
i
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
really
recall
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
--
how
long
this
thing
has
to
be
published.
mr.
william
p.
jones
once
a
week,
i
think.
mr.
william
p.
jones
once
a
week,
yes.
mr.
william
p.
jones
well,
it's
not
an
instantaneous
forfeiture,
your
honor
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
--
but
it
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
no.
and
yes.
that
isn't
certainly
one
of
the
features.
that
--
that's
what
makes
it
harder
because
there's
10
weeks
and
that's
all.
there
is
that
theory.
mr.
william
p.
jones
that
is
absolutely
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
p.
jones
that
is
absolutely
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
they
have
--
from
then
on,
they're
not
--
not
in
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
yes
as
it
--
that
and
--
and
particularly
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
--
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
mr.
william
p.
jones
i
call
that
a
forfeit,
sir.
mr.
william
p.
jones
that's
right.
it
is.
it's
to
confiscate
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
do
you
mean
that
if
the
--
if
the
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
it
would
--
it
would
be
just
as
bad
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
--
yes,
it
would.
just
as
bad.
mr.
william
p.
jones
it
would
be
just
bad
and
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
that's
right,
two
years
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
--
five,
just
as
bad.
mr.
william
p.
jones
essentially,
just
a
bad.
of
course,
you
might
have
to
pick-up
an
opportunity
in
the
--
in
a
longer
period
to
correct
yourself.
in
other
words,
you
--
you
again,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
put
your
--
put
the
two
together.
it's
very
--
it's
bad
enough
to
have
your
property
over
and
above
the
taxes
confiscated,
but
when
it's
done
swiftly
and
with
haste
and
weeks
is
a
--
is
a
short
time
to
lose
all
of
your
property.
why
then
it's
--
it's
troubling
then.it's
--
it's
lawful.
mr.
william
p.
jones
i
do
say
that.
mr.
william
p.
jones
yes,
i
do.
mr.
william
p.
jones
i
--
i
say
that
and
that's
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
--
one
point.
that
is
one
point
in
this
case.
mr.
william
p.
jones
i
have
never
seen
another
one,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
jones
i
have.
mr.
william
p.
jones
i
have
not
found
one,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
jones
i
haven't
checked
all
48-state.
mr.
william
p.
jones
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
p.
jones
that
is
correct.
every
--
every
statute
that
i
have
checked
in
connection
with
this
case
provides
a
surplus
sale.
and
when
--
now,
to
find
the
surplus
sale
is
at
least
requiring
a
sale
that
guarantees
that
the
tax
authority
is
going
to
get
only
its
taxes
plus
interest,
plus
penalties,
plus
cost
of
the
action
and
if
there's
anything
left
over,
it
goes
to
the
owner.
now,
the
other
--
very
briefly,
the
other
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
i
say
that,
yes,
but
they're
getting
a
windfall
that
it
isn't
tax
collection
at
all.
that
puts
the
tax
authority
in
the
real
estate
business.
the
other
case
that
he's
--
appellees
have
cited
in
support
of
the
statute
involves
a
michigan
statute.
so,
michigan
statute
also
provided
a
surplus
sale.
they
did
it
a
little
differently
in
a
rather
curious
difference
by
providing
that
the
purchaser
if
the
tax
fail
would
be
sold
the
smallest
possible,
undivided
fee
interest,
which
he
would
take
in
payment
for
the
amount
of
tax.
so
then,
you'll
see
the
purchase
if
the
tax
sale
winds
up
as
a
cotenant
in
fee
with
the
owner,
but
the
owner
still
has
his
surplus
represented
in
the
remainder
of
the
fee.
now,
that's
also
a
surplus
method.
he's
preserved
his
ownership
in
the
land.
likewise,
the
nebraska
statute,
involved
which
they
cite
in
support
of
this
statute.
i
want
to
refer
the
court
to
united
states,
the
lawton
110
u.s.146,
which
appears
to
be
very
close
to
the
point
of
this
case.
in
that
case,
the
united
states
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
us
v.
lawton.
mr.
william
p.
jones
right,
right.
mr.
william
p.
jones
well,
except
what
mr.
justice
black
presented
in
his
opinion,
that
if
the
surplus
hadn't
been
given
back
to
the
owner,
that
he
would
have
been
deprived
of
due
process
of
law.
mr.
william
p.
jones
but
i
want
to
point
out
--
i
--
i
think,
your
honor,
that
it
was
more
fundamental
than
that.
that
it
was
a
principle.
mr.
william
p.
jones
but
it
involved
regardless
of
the
statute.
mr.
william
p.
jones
well,
in
my
reading
of
the
opinion,
i
--
i
gathered
from
the
opinion
that
the
statute
didn't
actually
provide
for
the
surplus
to
go
to
the
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
there
is
a
point
of
improper
notice
in
this
case.
however,
following
the
doctrine
laid
down
in
the
mullane
case.
mullane
case,
which
was
the
key
to
the
decision
in
covey
versus
the
town
of
somers
states
that
any
pro
forma
notice,
which
is
reasonably
calculated
to
bring
the
action
to
the
attention
of
the
defendant
will
satisfy
the
minimum
requirements
of
the
due
process.
of
course,
in
the
covey
case,
there
is
an
incompetence,
but
we
contend
that
that
minimum
requirement
for
notice
is
not
satisfied
in
a
case
where
the
plaintiff,
the
party
bringing
the
action
in
new
york
city
in
this
case
knew
or
should
have
known
from
the
facts
that
the
pro
forma
notice
would
be
a
mere
gesture.
they
in
fact
did
know
that
this
notice
would
be
a
mere
gesture
or
should
have
known
and
are
chargeable
with
knowing
that
it
was
a
gesture
from
the
record
in
the
case.
now,
this
is
why
after
plaintiffs
--
after
appellants,
queens
property
had
been
taken,
they
continued
to
pay
real
estate
taxes
on
it.
and
the
city
continued
to
bill
them
for
taxes,
even
though
the
city
had
taken
title
to
it
and
sold
it
to
somebody
else
for
$7000
and
retained
all
the
proceeds,
the
city
still
continued
to
bill
the
appellant
for
real
estate
taxes
and
the
appellant
paid
those
taxes.
now,
if
that
isn't
notice
to
an
opposite
party,
who
in
turn
is
going
to
rely
on
pro
forma
notice
to
give
this
uninformed
person
notice
about
confiscatory
action,
then
he's
not
going
to
get
any
notice.
why,
i
--
i
don't
see
what
--
what
would
be
a
good
example.furthermore,
the
appellants
paid
the
much
higher
real
estate
taxes
and
left
unpaid
the
water
charges.
now,
the
water
charges
were
small
in
amount,
but
because
they
are
the
older
ones,
they
would
detain
these
ones.
but
nevertheless,
they
went
on
paying
these
--
these
large
taxes.
now,
that
also
is
notice
to
the
city
that
their
pro
forma
type
of
notice
would
not
get
across
to
the
appellant
and
therefore,
there
is
not
the
proper
minimum
notice
in
this
case
required
by
mullane,
the
ruling
of
the
mullane
case.
mr.
william
p.
jones
served
as
--
as
a
--
as
process
in
a
civil
action.
that's
the
minimum
in
a
civil
action,
is
personal
service.
in
this
particular
case,
when
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
my
argument
here
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
that's
right,
sir.
that's
right.
mr.
william
p.
jones
personal
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
i
think
a
--
a
letter,
something
--
certainly,
something
more
than
he
got,
possibly,
a
telegram
to
his
house,
possibly
a
personal
call
or
some
kind
of
a
personal
contact.
they
knew
these
notices
weren't
getting
across,
because
he
certainly
wasn't
behaving
like
a
man
who
was
getting
notice
of
his
property
being
in
danger.
mr.
william
p.
jones
a
--
a
great
many
tax,
i'm
sure.
mr.
william
p.
jones
there
are
a
great
many.
that
would
be
--
it
would
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
how
many?
there
must
be
--
there
are
maybe
500,000.
mr.
william
p.
jones
(inaudible)
mr.
william
p.
jones
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
correct,
as
soon
as
i
can,
some
misimpressions
about
the
chapman
case
that
may
have
--
had
left
with
you.
the
chapman
case
was
decided
long
after
this
case
that
we're
trying
now
was
decided
and
long
after,
of
course,
this
case
has
begun.
of
course,
this
case
also
was
begun
after
any
opportunity
to
make
use
of
the
answer
in
this
foreclosure
action
had
expired
and
the
--
and
the
chapman
interpretation
of
that
section
is
only
good
for
a
taxpayer
whose
time
to
answer
hasn't
expired.
mr.
william
p.
jones
there's
one
good
reason
why
the
one
thing
i
--
i
know
the
lawyer
in
the
chapman
case
and
--
and
the
--
and
the
--
the
state
statute,
your
honor,
that
is,
this
prototype
statute
of
new
york
state
does
provide
that
where
an
answer
is
filed.
then,
you'll
have
certain
rights
that
you
don't
have
when
you
don't
file
an
answer
to
that.
we
all
knew
that
very,
very
clearly
and
discussed
that
particular
point
that
the
state
statute
provided
that
where
an
answer
is
filed,
you
can
then,
in
a
proper
case,
move
for
a
--
to
request
the
sale
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
--
but
this
--
this
--
that
you
didn't
have
it
there.
mr.
william
p.
jones
well,
they
can't
ever
say
that
the
--
this
case
here
was
started
long
before.
mr.
william
p.
jones
this
case
was
started
in
january
of
1953.
mr.
william
p.
jones
no,
i
don't
think
there
is
anything
into
the
mamaroneck
case
that
have
stimulated
anybody's
thought
that
the
--
that
--
that
filing
an
answer
would
have
been
includable
under
the
relief
in
this
statute,
but
what
good
would
it
have
done
to
anybody
in
this
case?
the
chance
to
answer
had
long
since
expired,
long
since.
mr.
william
p.
jones
no,
there
wasn't,
your
honor,
and
that's
what
i
want
to
correct
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
because
the
answer
had
to
be
filed
20
days
after
--
it
had
to
be
filed
10
weeks
after
this
foreclosure
action
and
that
have
gone
on
years
before.
mr.
william
p.
jones
yes.
mr.
william
p.
jones
at
--
at
any
rate,
any
chance
to
make
use
of
an
--
of
an
interpretation
of
--
of
what
could
be
done
with
an
answered
file
in
this
case,
long
since
gone.
mr.
william
p.
jones
well,
yes,
if
you
--
if
you're
--
if
you
have
the
misfortune
to
miss
your
chance
to
answer
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
well,
i
mean,
then
you
have
a
--
then,
there
is
a
confiscation
if
you
miss
your
chance
to
answer.
just
a
few
brief
words
on
this
--
on
this
remedial
statute.
remedial
statute
says
that
the
taxpayer
has
to
pay
not
only
all
of
the
taxes
that
were
due
at
the
time
the
city
took
the
property
but
all
of
the
taxes
since
that
date
plus
interest
during
the
period
of
the
city's
claimed
ownership
and
while
the
city
is
collecting
the
rents.
you're
given
no
credit
for
the
rent.
in
addition
to
that
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
i
have
--
agree
that
i'd
have
an
awful
fight
with
the
city
on
the
interpretation
of
that
statute
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
--
because
i
--
it
has
been
discussed
on
the
phone
who
would
get
those
rents
and
that
it
has
--
i've
have
been
informed
that
the
city
is
going
to
keep
the
rents.
mr.
william
p.
jones
under
the
statute,
they
claimed
that
they're
entitled
to
the
rent.
so,
you
see
there
--
it's
a
fight
who's
going
to
get
the
benefit
of
about
four
years
of
grants
which
are
considerable.
so,
it's
--
it's
a
very
--
it
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
well,
you
would
have
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
that
--
that
is
certainly
a
strong
argument.
mr.
william
p.
jones
that
is
a
strong
argument
if
i
have
to
go
--
have
to
fight
this
one
out
too,
i'll
certainly
remember
what
your
honor
has
said
promptly
[laughter]
the
strength
of
the
argument.
mr.
william
p.
jones
but
there
should
be
an
end
of
litigation
sometime
and
i
hope
that
we
don't
have
to
go
to
--
mr.
william
p.
jones
[laughter]
mr.
william
p.
jones
i
have
only
a
few
minutes
left
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
something
that
i
didn't
get
to
in
my
main
argument.
that
when
the
city
resorted
to
this
stringent
method
of
collecting
the
taxes,
there
was
available
to
it
existing
in
as
part
of
their
tax
law,
the
method
under
title
a
which
was
the
well-accepted
method
of
selling
a
tax
lien.
and
then,
the
purchaser
of
the
tax
lien
forecloses
the
tax
lien
and
the
owner
gets
surplus.
now,
that
method
was
available
and
it
was
an
alternative
method.
this
wasn't
a
mandatory
method
in
rem.
they
had
a
choice.
they
had
an
alternative.
but
they
chose
to
use
the
--
the
abrupt,
the
confiscatory
method
because
the
--
the
record
undoubtedly
showed
here
that
this
taxpayer
didn't
know
what
was
going
on
and
that
this
was
the
--
a
sure
windfall
that
was
brought
in
to
the
in
rem
proceeding
which
it
turned
out
to
be
some
$51,000
of
windfall
property.
also,
there's
the
clearly
expressed
intent
of
the
legislature
contained
in
the
governor's
bill
jacket
which
says
that
the
in
rem
method
was
intended
to
get
back
on
the
tax
rules,
heavily
encumbered
properties
whose
--
where
the
taxes
had
--
had
practically
doubled
up
the
economic
value.
and
that
title
a,
this
is
the
corresponding
title
in
the
state
statute,
was
intended
to
be
applied
to
improve
properties.
now,
i
--
i
submit
that
the
--
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
that
the
action
of
the
city
violated
the
appellant's
constitutional
rights.
it
isn't
necessary
to
knock
out
the
entire
statute.
we
claim
that
only
as
applied
to
the
appellants
in
this
case.
however,
it
would
be
within
the
scope
of
the
court
if
they
saw
so
fit.
we
urge
that
the
order
be
reversed
with
cause.
