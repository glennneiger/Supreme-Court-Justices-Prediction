justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
was
the
address
given
by
the
trustee
by
the
city
of
new
york?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
water
bills
waterloo
on
that
basis
did
--
they
were
arrears?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no.
were
there
no
notices
indicating
there
have
arrears?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
appeared
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
water
bill?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
he
has
notice
that
there
are
some
arrears
in
some
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
in
fact
we
must
know
that
nonpayment
of
taxes,
arrears
may
have
consequences
and
he
stepped
out,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
this
trustee
--
this
trustee
is
the
size
of
a
property?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
the
trustee,
does
it
appear
whether
he
was
an
innocent,
that
he
was
unversed
in
--
in
transactions
like
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
if
he'd
get
billed
in
the
said
arrears
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
there's
no
suggestion
that
he
was
not
mentally
competent
to
know
what
arrears
is,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
isn't
--
is
this
an
old
lady
who's
mentally
defective
like
the
somers
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
man
gets
the
bill
which
says
arrears
and
he
knew
he
had
paid
his
taxes.
was
that
just
one
bill
in
the
said
arrears
or
several
bills?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
good
--
good
--
except
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
series
over
years.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
man
who's
--
who's
aware
of
the
fact
that
he
takes
for
granted
that
he
paid
his
bills,
gets
--
he
paid
past
bills
gets
the
current
bill
that
says
arrears
to
get
a
series
of
them
and
he
just
disregards
that
fact,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
did
he
--
did
he
--
did
he
take
it?
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
show
that
he
ever
said
that
to
himself
that
he's
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
say
again
this
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
this
was
a
trustee
of
an
estate
wasn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
to
the
amount
of
--
did
--
did
the
record
show
that
the
--
that
the
whole
estate
embraced
other
property
besides
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
was
a
substantial
--
this
was
a
trustee
of
substantial
properties.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
came
to
him
because
he
paid
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
in
the
office
here.
they
--
they
came
to
him.
they
were
brought
to
his
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
then
--
that
aspect
of
the
trustee
that
was
paying
bills
on
which
was
printed
arrear,
he
didn't
leave
to
his
agent,
he
did
himself?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
is
that
this
trustee
wasn't
a
compensated
trustee.
i
don't
suppose
i
have
to
guess
as
to
the
irrelevance
that
he
was
an
imaginary
trustee
because
the
estate
was
transferred
under
a
will
of
complete
--
it's
bearing
the
same
name
nelson.
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
father
and
son.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
went
to
the
office.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
mean
to
say
is
the
water
commissioner
or
the
comptroller
of
new
york
didn't
call
him
up
on
the
telephone
and
say,
“mr.
jones,
did
you
get
a
notice?”
he
said,
“yes.”
that
isn't
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
anything
he
says?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
for
an
equity
redemption?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
you
have
federal
cases
you
have
(inaudible)
point
because
the
statute
there
explicitly
(inaudible)
pertinent
to
the
redemption.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
within
that
procedure,
we
don't
a
chance
to
--
if
there
was
that's
been
suspended
for
this.
it
collects
an
opportunity
for
making
(inaudible)
through
the
cutoff
day,
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--does
d17-6.0
printed
in
your
appendix
e?
(inaudible)
when
the
city
--
when
the
city
begins
its
foreclosure
proceeding
to
the
opportunity
of
the
delinquent
taxpayer
to
get
the
surplus,
seek
or
have
you
got
the
--
the
period
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
provided
by
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
he
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
so
that
there
is
no
forfeiture
until
he's
had
the
opportunity
until
these
extra
10
weeks
or
whatever
they
are
left.
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
forfeiture
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
exactly
cutting
off
from
getting
there
in
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
statute
gave
him
notice
that
there's
a
publication
of
all
of
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
sure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
six
weeks
running.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
fact,
it
says
so,
week
after
week.
justice
felix
frankfurter
once
a
week?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
that
there
isn't
a
forfeiture
following
upon
the
late
issues.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
then
it
gets
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
back
to
the
point
that
mr.
justice
douglas
asked
you
about,
whether
you
claim
that
the
time
is
too
short.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
you
have
10
weeks
or
half
a
year,
if
--
if
you
could
get
the
city
all
the
revenue
to
skip
to
--
to
collect
the
--
the
unpaid
taxes
out
of
the
property
that's
times
in
a
period?
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
example
two
years
after
these
proceeding
starts.
that,
the
argument,
those
you
have
just
--
which
you've
just
indicated
was
exact.
which
is
just
enough,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
would
be
bad.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
two
years,
five
years
automatic.
justice
felix
frankfurter
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
in
rem
then
has
nothing
to
do
with
--
notice
has
nothing
to
do
with
--
whether
although
the
commissioner
--
one
of
the
commissioner
(inaudible)
has
personally
called
up
mr.
nelson
and
told
him
all
about
it
or
had
to
have
it
in
a
(inaudible)
wouldn't
make
any
difference
because
the
statute
which
did
the
city
release
beyond,
the
dollars
will
send
to
the
delinquent
tax
you
said
are
constitutional,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
statute
is
(inaudible)
right
for
the
seizure
of
the
property
to
say
the
government
to
satisfy
out
of
the
money,
out
of
the
amount
received
from
the
sale.
the
government
may
satisfy
a
tax
rule
under
separated
(inaudible)
that
has
come
to
the
owner.
the
statute
explicitly
provided
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
doesn't
follow
the
counter
statute
is
a
part
and
agree
that
it
was
constitutional.
it
doesn't
even
follow
because
the
united
states
has
a
different
statute,
that
new
york
does
have
its
kind
of
a
statute.
and
it
doesn't
follow
because
now,
new
york
has
ameliorated
its
statute.
that
what
it
did
before
was
beyond
the
power
of
the
city.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
because
the
statute
said
he
was
entitled
to
it.
why
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
mr.
jones,
they
have
a
statute
that
explicitly
says
the
secretary
of
the
treasury.
the
property
is
sold
and
has
net
$10,000
and
there
(inaudible)
a
tax
of
$453,
the
rest
can
be
confiscated
because
congress
said
it
must
be
returned.
of
course,
if
you
don't
give
back
what
congress
said
you're
entitled
to,
that's
the
deprivation
of
property
arbitrarily
and
therefore
without
due
process
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
no
matter
how
it
ended.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
in
any
explicit
detail
turned.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
would
you
regard
a
personal
service
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
what
would
you
regard
as
personal
service?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
personal
call
or
a
telegram,
roughly,
how
many
taxes
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
are
there
in
the
city
of
new
york?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
matters
pertaining
to
mootness
arriving
subsequently
do
not
fall
within
rule
of
court
that
case
was
to
be
decided
on
the
record
because
the
issue
of
mootness
arises
subsequent
to
and
therefore,
whatever
is
relevant
to
determining
that
as
you
may
properly
be
before
this
court,
as
i
understand
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
wasn't
among
the
questions
that
he
raised
when
--
when
this
jurisdiction
was
stated,
either.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
in
effect,
the
statute
doesn't
fitly
not
in
words
indicate
that.
so,
what
--
what
i
gather
from
the
chapman
docks
case
is
that
the
appellate
division
--
is
that
the
last
word
on
this
subject?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
but
--
but
is
this
the
last
adjudication
on
this
subject?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
what
this
in
effect
does
is
to
grant
upon
the
statute
a
judicially
interpreted
right
to
cover
sale
and
get
the
surplus.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
also
direct
to
the
statute
for
our
purpose
as
though
they
have
been
written
in
the
statute
for
purposes
of
construing
the
statute
by
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
think
that's
--
what
that
statute
means
is
for
new
york's
court
to
say
and
you
say
the
appellate
division
has
spoken
and
this
is
not
--
no
appeal
has
been
taken.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
evidently,
the
city
--
did
the
city
lose
there?
the
city
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
the
appellant
is
there,
the
city
didn't
appeal
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
therefore,
that's
the
binding
decision
and
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
1956.
justice
felix
frankfurter
page
24
of
the
appellant's
brief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
haven't
read
that
opinion.
i
have
sent
words,
but
i
assume
it's
not
too
difficult
to
see
the
process
by
which
the
court
arrived
to
that
inasmuch
as
a
man
may
come
in
and
pay
$623.
he
comes
in
and
says,
“this
is
my
property.
that's
a
fund.
would
you
translate
that
fund
into
dollars
and
cents
and
take
out
what
belongs
to
you
and
give
the
rest
to
me?”
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
notice
in
as
i
now,
fairly
rapidly
looked
at
the
small
type
in
the
chapman
docks
opinion
and
i
notice
they
say
that
if
a
party
says
and
so
on,
the
court
should
inquire
as
the
case
of
the
proper
for
directly
of
sale
so
that
surplus
moneys
may
be
available
to
the
answering
party.
and
i
noticed
they
were
confronted
with
the
--
the
village
of
mamaroneck
--
mamaroneck
case
273
app.
div.
(inaudible)
anyhow,
they
have
that
opinion
staring
them
in
the
face
and
they
distinguished
that
case
because
they
said
in
that
case
the
owner
--
merely
the
owner
didn't
say
the
property
was
worth
more.
he
didn't
claim
a
sale.
he
didn't
claim
a
surplus
interest
so
that
presumably
this
is
a
moot
and
has
been
a
mooted
question
in
new
york
and
then
they
go
on
and
say,
“the
--
if
it
--
it
be
intended
that
as
an
owner
who
has
answer
and
property
has
a
value
substantially
exceeding
the
amount
of
the
tax
liens
is
to
be
deprived
of
an
equitable
right
to
surplus
money,
the
statute
must
so
state
or
so
indicate
clearly.”
and
their
decision
is
that
they
impliedly
read
(inaudible)
of
provision
into
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
a
fair
construction
of
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
in
value
does
the
appellate
division
have
there,
about
300?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
it
300?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
--
that
preceded
this
litigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
preceded
this
litigation
and
this
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
this
general
problem
was
canvassing
the
mamaroneck.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
bearing
on
the
question
of
mootness.
it
can
be
mooted
only
if
the
exact,
as
i
see
it
this
is
my
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
that
which
he
claimed,
that
which
he's
entitled
to
claim
on
his
own
theory
is
provided
by
the
statute
to
wit
that
he
gets,
that
he
merely
is
the
subject
to
the
delinquent
taxes.
now,
does
the
statute
leave
him
in
that,
even
wholly
the
new
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
yes,
i
don't
--
why
would
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
cost.
well
(inaudible),
but
beyond
that,
he
--
it
gives
him
what
he
claims
to
be
--
he
was
improperly
or
invalidly,
illegally
deprived
of
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
namely,
the
surplus
value
beyond
the
statutes
and
clause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
gets
the
property
back.
he
simply
has
to
take
actions
for
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
then?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
gets
the
property
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
he
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
would
be
in
the
position
to
litigate
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
the
question
whether
he
should
have
had
the
rental
on
the
city
while
he
owned
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
suggest
that
in
our
profession,
we
assume
that
when
a
decision
is
handed
down,
it
wasn't
concocted
the
minute
that
the
decision
was
handed
down,
but
i'm
not
resorting
to
a
fiction
as
evidence
of
the
lawyer
of
the
chapman.
he
thought
that
the
statute
was
in
itself
without
construction
and
he
was
alerted
to
think
so
by
the
discussion
of
mamaroneck
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
i'm
merely
suggesting
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
merely
suggest
that
the
--
that
the
stimulus
to
all
that
the
statute
might
be
so
interpreted
wasn't
there
and
i
should
think
it
is
there
particularly
(inaudible)
that
wasn't
merely
a
case
in
which
you
could
reason
on
the
fact
that
the
chapman's
doctrine
isn't
--
wasn't
really
in
that
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
to
my
mind.
when
was
this
being
started?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
mamaroneck
case
at
273
app.
div.
does
not
involve
after
1948.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
was
a
chance
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
because
of
the
--
because
of
the
notion
that
he
knows?
it
went
back
to
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
will
you
say
to
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
one-night
decision?
will
you
say
--
will
you
quote
it
as
a
one-night
decision
of
the
city?
