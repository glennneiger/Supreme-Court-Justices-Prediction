mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
that
amount
again,
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
came
to
the
office
in
the
ordinary
course
of
mail,
i
presume.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
come
by
mail?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
did
the
envelope
show
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
this
--
this
failure
to
pay
the
water
tax
is
shown
in
the
general
term
in
arrears
on
the
property
tax,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
now,
if
there
had
not
been
some
other
debt
as
the
word
arrears
wouldn't
have
been
there,
would
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
this
trustee
compensated
for
his
trusteeship?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
--
it
was
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
his
office?
chief
justice
earl
warren
his
address?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
--
how
would
they
collect
their
tax?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
did
someone
suggest
that
they
ever
--
tax
sales
as
we
all
know
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
many
tax
sales
and
what
--
what
people
do,
they
go
on,
and
they
set
the
amount
of
the
taxes
of
the
property.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
find
this
statute
to
be
unique
or
rather
similar
statutes
throughout
the
country?
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
you
looked
for
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
been
unable
to
find
any
statutes
that
have
a
--
a
procedure
similar
to
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
of
them,
all
of
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
of
them
that
you
have
checked
to
give
them
an
opportunity
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
get
back
the
excess
over
the
taxes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
that
some
brief
says
about
837,000
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
quel.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
file
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
other
states
--
do
other
states
have
statutes
of
this
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
year
was
that,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
very
recent.
chief
justice
earl
warren
had
that
procedure
ever
been
opened
to
--
to
the
appellant
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
it
have
had
to
be
before
the
--
the
docks
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
there
was
no
knowledge
that
they
--
on
--
on
the
part
of
the
public
generally
that
they
had
that
right.
that
--
that
is
really
the
initial
statute,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may
give
to
the
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
jones.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
agree
you
would
have
an
action
against
the
city
for
those
rents
in
the
event
that
you
pay
the
taxes
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
agreed
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
mean
that
they're
legally
entitled
to
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may.
