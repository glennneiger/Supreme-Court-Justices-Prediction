mr.
seymour
b.
quel
if
the
court
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
thank
you,
your
honor.
if
the
court
pleases,
before
i
discuss
the
merits
of
the
statute,
i
have
suggested
in
my
brief
and
my
adversary
does
not
agree
that
this
appeal
was
academic
with
respect
to
the
larger
of
the
two
parcels
involved.
now,
mr.
jones
did
not
touch
upon
that
aspect
of
the
case
in
my
argument
and
i
would
like
to
develop
that
briefly.
when
this
case
got
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
a
brief
opinion,
“this
is
a
hard
case,
but
relief
should
come
from
the
legislature.”
after
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
mr.
jones
filed
his
notice
of
appeal
to
this
court
after
he
got
the
--
was
permitted
to
amend
--
amend
it
and
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction.
now,
in
the
meantime,
the
new
york
legislature
amended
the
in
rem
foreclosure
statute
and
that
amendment
is
annexed
as
an
appendix
to
my
brief.
and
that
amendment
provided
in
substance
that
with
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
the
appendix,
your
honor,
commencing
on
page
20
of
--
of
my
brief.
it
was
laws
of
1956,
chapter
481.
now,
that
amendment
provided
in
substance
that
with
respect
to
in
rem
foreclosures,
which
had
been
completed
in
the
past,
the
taxpayer
could
come
in
within
a
period
of
60
days
after
the
passage
of
a
statute
and
request
the
return
of
his
property.
and
the
board
of
estimate
in
its
discretion
could
grant
that
application,
provided
that
he
paid
the
back
taxes.
as
to
future
in
rem
foreclosures,
the
period
for
doing
that
was
four
months,
but
it
also
expressly
applied
retroactively,
provided,
you
came
in
within
the
60-day
period.
now,
this
taxpayer
came
in
and
requested
that
the
property
be
reconveyed
to
him
pursuant
to
the
statute
and
we
wrote
him
a
letter
and
said,
“we
would
reconvey
it
to
whom,
provided,
that
he
paid”
--
it
was
about
$15,000
of
taxes
which
accrued
in
the
meantime.
and
he
wrote
back
a
letter
which
said,
“we'll
be
glad
to
do
this
after
the
supreme
court
decides
the
case,
but
will
you
please
hold
it
in
abeyance
while
the
appeal
is
pending.”
now,
those
letters
are
not
part
of
the
record,
because
i
--
and
i
didn't
want
to
print
them
as
a
appendices
because
strictly
speaking,
they
are
not
part
of
the
record
and
they
couldn't
be.
they
are
circumstances
which
happened
after
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
however,
i
have
made
typewritten
copies
of
those
letters
and
with
the
court's
permission,
i'd
like
to
hand
them
up.
the
statute,
of
course,
i've
printed
because
the
court
can
take
judicial
notice
of
that.
now
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
surely.
well,
i'm
glad
you
know
that,
your
honor.
and
perhaps,
i
should
have
printed
as
an
appendix
to
my
brief,
but
i
hesitated
to
do
that.
now,
it
seems
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
no,
it
relates
to
one
of
the
two
properties
involved.
the
reason
for
that
is
this.
the
statute
is
expressly
made
applicable
to
any
property
which
the
city
has
not
reconveyed
since
it
acquired
title.
now,
the
larger
of
the
two
properties,
the
city
still
had
when
the
statute
was
passed
and
by
its
expressed
terms
the
statute
applied.
the
other
property,
the
so-called
45th
avenue
property
which
is
the
smaller
of
the
two
the
city
had
sold
some
six
or
seven
months
after
it
--
it
had
acquired
title.
and
as
to
that,
the
statute
does
not
apply
and
i
can
see
that
the
appeals
of
our
respect
to
that
parcel.
but
as
to
the
other
parcel,
i
think
that
the
appeal
is
moot.
now,
of
course,
in
his
reply
brief,
the
--
mr.
jones
says
he
doesn't
like
the
statute
and
its
terms
and
so
forth,
but
any
question
--
i
mean,
the
--
the
ameliorated
statute.
but
any
questions
relating
to
that
are,
of
course,
not
before
the
court
on
this
appeal
and
would
have
to
be,
it
seems
to
me,
the
subject
of
a
separate
proceeding.
now,
turning
to
the
other
parcel
as
to
which
clearly
the
appeal
survives.
what
happened
here
in
substance
is
that
the
appellant
had
a
bookkeeper
who
was
an
embezzler
and
a
thief
and
they
say
so,
themselves.
incidentally,
i
don't
know
to
this
day,
what
the
bookkeeper's
name
was
or
--
or
what's
happened
to
him.
we
have
accepted
at
their
face
value
the
statements
contained
by
mr.
nelson
in
his
affidavit
when
he
moved
to
set
aside
the
in
rem
foreclosure
with
relation
of
his
property.
and
mr.
nelson
says
on
page
9
of
the
record
in
his
affidavit,
“on
or
about
november
13th
1952,
the
bookkeeper's
attempted
suicide
precipitated
deponent's
discovery
that
the
bookkeeper
had
for
a
number
of
years
been
converting
his
employer's
funds
to
his
own
use.
and
otherwise,
acting,
so
as
to
injure
deponent
and
his
co-trustees
and
deprive
them
of
their
property.
now,
of
course,
that
lies
at
the
crux
of
the
case.
i
don't
see
how
the
question
of
notice
can
arise
in
this
case,
as
it
did
for
instance
in
the
mullane
case
or
as
it
did
in
this
town
of
somers
case,
which
incidentally
involved
a
very
similar
statute
to
the
instant
one,
but
it
was
the
new
york
state
statute
or
the
instant
one
is
applicable
in
new
york
city
alone.
in
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
it's
passed
by
the
-
by
the
state,
your
honor,
as
an
--
as
an
amendment
to
the
new
york
city
administrative
code.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
the
other
is
the
statewide
statute
and
i
might
explain
to
your
honor,
just
what
the
difference
is
and
why
we
--
why
we
felt
that
a
new
york
city
statute
was
necessary.
you
see,
those
statutes
provide
that
when
you
foreclose,
you
cannot
exclude
any
property
which
is
delinquent
because
what
they
were
trying
to
guard
against
was
any
possible
favoritism
on
the
part
of
the
collecting
officer.
now,
the
state
statute
provides
that
if
a
parcel
has
been
delinquent
for
four
or
more
years,
the
tax
district
may
foreclose.and
when
the
tax
district
proceeds
against
these
parcels
which
are
delinquent,
it
takes
in
every
delinquent
parcel
within
the
tax
district.
now,
of
course,
new
york
city
with
its
five
counties
is
all
one-tax
district
and
that
just
wouldn't
have
worked
for
the
city.
we
don't
want
to
foreclose
against
everything
all
at
once.
so,
the
new
york
statute
which
parallels
the
state
one
very
closely
provides
in
substance
that
instead
of
doing
it
by
the
whole
tax
district,
you
can
do
it
by
so-called
wards
or
sections.
the
city
treasurer
picks
out
a
section
which
is
a
well-recognized
geographical
division
of
the
tax
map
and
then
proceeds
with
the
in
rem
foreclosure.
now,
if
he
proceeds
--
and
again,
they
were
trying
to
guard
against
any
playing
of
favorites
in
its
taking
in
some
parcels
and
excluding
others,
if
a
parcel
is
delinquent
within
the
definition
of
a
statute,
it
may
not
be
excluded
except
or
--
for
rather
narrow
exceptions
which
are
not
irrelevant
by
all.
briefly,
if
some
question
of
title
has
been
raised
or
if
some
question
as
to
--
if
some
arrangement
has
already
been
made
to
pay
the
taxes
on
an
installment
plan
and
one
of
the
minor
exception.
now,
that
means
that
when
the
city
proceeds
against
a
particular
section,
it
must
include
within
that
section
every
parcel
which
is
four
or
more
years
delinquent
as
to
taxes.
the
city
treasurer
has
no
discretion.
he
may
not
exclude
it
because
it
is
small.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
passage
of
the
statute
was
if
the
city
had
an
enormous
number
of
tax
liens
and
no
practicable
method
of
collecting
them.
you
see,
the
old
alternative
method
and
the
one
which
prevails
before
the
in
rem
procedure
was
in
essence,
a
method
which
was
substantially
in
personam
and
was
similar
to
a
private
mortgage
foreclosure.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
it
was
passed
in
1948
and
was
first
applied
by
the
city
in
1950.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
there
--
not
in
the
city.
there
had
been
a
state
tax
statute
which
as
i
recall,
it
was
passed
in
1939.
and
which
was
before,
your
honors,
in
the
--
in
the
town
of
somers
case,
although,
you
didn't
reach
the
question
of
its
constitutionality
and
i
might
say
that
there
are
two
other
cases,
one
of
which
is
cited
in
my
brief,
the
pennoyer
case.
and
another
one
in
320
--
in
the
lynbrook
gardens
case
in
322
u.s.742
in
which,
your
honors
denied
certiorari
to
review
the
state
in
rem
statute
on
the
ground
of
unconstitutionality.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
anymore
than
this
one
does.
it
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
on
the
application
of
the
certiorari
in
the
--
sorry,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
in
the
lynbrook
gardens
case,
they
raised
that
exact
point.
they
said,
the
statute
fails
to
provide
for
public
sale
of
property
against
which
the
tax
liens
have
been
foreclosed
and
the
distribution
of
surplus
moneys
to
the
owners
of
said
property
and
they
claimed
that
it
was
unconstitutional
without
reason.your
honors
denied
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
we
don't
call
it
that
in
new
york.
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
term.
now
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
well,
your
honor,
that's
a
hard
question
for
me
to
answer.
at
least
my
answer
is,
i
don't
know.
now,
the
reason
i
don't
know
is
that
this
is
the
first
time
i
--
i
got
my
adversary's
reply
brief
this
morning.
i
was
right
with
mine
and
to
that
extent,
it
was
my
fault,
but
in
any
event,
until
i
got
that
reply
brief,
that
point
has
never
been
raised
in
this
case.
he
never
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
our
statute
was
unconstitutional
because
it
didn't
provide
for
sale
of
the
property.
he
raised
other
points
which
i'll
come
to,
presently,
but
this
is
the
first
time
that
this
question
has
ever
been
raised,
and
any
claim
has
been
made
that
our
statute
is
unconstitutional
because
it
does
not
provide
resale.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
no,
your
honors.
it
--
it
was
not.
now,
i
started
to
say
that
i
don't
see
how
any
question
of
notice
arises
in
this
case.
the
bookkeeper
was
dishonest
and
the
notice
for
that
reason,
some
of
the
notices
never
reached
the
appellants.
they
do
not
deny
that
notice
of
a
foreclosure
suits
the
two
in
rem
proceedings
was
addressed
to
them
at
the
address
which
they
gave,
which
was
estate
of
william
nelson.
i
think
it
was
36
west
44th
street.
the
notices
were
sent
there.
they
got
there.
they
were
never
returned.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
by
mail.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
yes,
your
honor,
and
the
statute
so
provides
--
the
statute
provides
that
if
you
register
your
name
with
treasurer
as
the
owner
of
property,
he
must
under
the
in
rem
foreclosure
statute,
in
addition
to
the
publication
in
various
newspapers
and
the
filing
in
the
county
clerk's
office,
he
must
send
you
a
notice
by
mail
and
he
did
that
here.
and
they
got
that
notice.
that
is,
the
bookkeeper
got
it.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
no.
no,
you
--
you
were
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
--
it's
optional
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
the
--
if
the
--
if
you
don't
do
it
that
the
treasurer
hasn't
got
your
address.
of
course,
you
can't
mail
that
notice
and
he
makes
an
affidavit
to
that
effect.
but
where
you
register
your
name
with
them,
he'll
--
he
sends
you
this
notice.
he
must
under
the
statute
and
there's
no
claim
here
that
he
didn't.
in
fact,
it's
admitted
that
he
did.
that
they
--
what
--
what
they
say
in
essence
is
the
notices
were
sent.
the
bookkeeper
got
them
and
he
never
called
the
notices
of
the
foreclosure
suit
to
the
attention
of
the
trustee.
now,
they
do
say
however,
that
during
this
period
of
time
and
this
all
comes
from
mr.
nelson's
affidavit
without
any
attempt
on
our
part
to
go
into
the
facts
which
we
accepted
is
true.
he
said
that
for
a
period
of
years,
the
bookkeeper
used
to
present
the
tax
bill
and
he
used
to
make
out
a
check
and
he
used
to
pay
the
tax
bills.
now,
if
your
honors
will
turn
to
page
36
of
the
record,
a
sample
of
one
of
the
tax
bills
is
--
is
there
reproduced.
and
your
honors,
and
this
--
this
relates
to
the
--
to
the
45th
avenue
property
and
your
honors
will
see
that
on
about
the
middle
of
the
page
and
slightly
to
the
right,
after
giving
the
amount
of
the
taxes,
the
amount
of
the
taxes
$196.20,
incidentally,
your
honors
will
note
the
address
of
the
appellant's,
estate
of
william
nelson,
36
west
44th
and
so
forth.
now,
the
amount
of
the
taxes,
$196.20,
the
first
half
is
$98.10.the
second
half
is
$98.10.
and
thereafter,
there
appears
the
word
"arrears".
and
in
--
underneath,
there
appears
the
legend.
the
word
"arrears"
as
it
appears
on
the
space
indicated
by
the
arrow,
which
is
the
arrow
which
appears
right
underneath
"arrears"
means
that
as
of
june
30,
1950,
previous
taxes,
assessments
or
water
charges
have
not
been
reported
as
paid.
if
these
have
not
been
paid
since
june
30
of
1950,
payment
should
be
made
immediately.
now,
for
a
period
of
some
seven
or
eight
years,
the
trustee
got
those
of
that
character.
he
made
out
the
check
for
the
current
taxes.
he
never
bothered
to
find
out
what
the
word
"arrears"
meant
or
what
it
stood
for.
i
don't
see
how
within
the
limits
of
reasonable
procedure,
if
you
have
any
kind
of
an
in
rem
proceeding,
you
could
hardly
give
more
notice
than
was
given
here.
the
fault
as
i
say,
lies
in
the
dishonesty
of
the
bookkeeper.
now,
some
questions
were
raised
during
the
course
of
mr.
jones'
argument
with
reference
to
the
right
of
redemption
under
the
existing
administrative
code
provisions.
now,
that
statute
provides,
but
after
the
treasurer
shall
have
filed
his
list
and
published
and
mailed
notice
and
so
forth.
well,
he
have
to
publish
as
i
recall
it
once
a
week
for
--
for
six
successive
weeks
and
then
you
have
20
days
to
answer.
and
the
--
excuse
me,
the
appellate
division
of
the
new
york
supreme
court
has
held
that
if
you
have
any
--
of
course,
you
can
come
in
and
pay
your
taxes
which
is
one
way
of
getting
your
property
back.
but
in
--
in
addition
to
that,
you
can
if
you
wish,
file
an
answer
which
says
in
effect.
“well,
i
don't
want
to
pay
my
taxes,
but
please
sell
my
property
separately
and
put
aside
any
surplus
for
me.”
and
under
the
chapman
docks
case
which
is
cited
in
my
brief,
you
can
do
that
so
that
if
you
have
an
equity
on
the
property
or
you
(inaudible)
substantial
equity
in
the
property,
you
may,
if
you
wish
preserve
that
equity
in
that
manner.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
well,
you
file
an
answer
and
you
--
and
you
say
--
you'll
in
effect
ask
the
court
to
direct
that
your
property
be
taken
out
of
the
--
of
--
of
the
property
as
listed
and
sold
separately
at
a
public
sale
and
any
surplus
derived
from
such
sale
be
set
aside
to
your
benefit.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
you
file
it
as
an
answer
to
the
in
rem
foreclosure
proceeding,
yes,
in
the
supreme
court.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
may
i
explain
that?
what
happens
is
this.
the
city
treasurer
makes
up
a
list
of
delinquent
tax
parcels
and
he
then
files
that
in
the
county
clerk's
office
and
he
--
and
that
is
headed
if
your
honor
will
note
under
the
terms
of
the
statute
which
is
--
where
is
the
appellee
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
--
which
is
set
forth
in
the
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
page
20
of
the
appellant's
brief.
your
honor,
will
notice
on
page
22.
it
says,
“such
list
shall
be
known
and
designated
as
the
list
of

essential,
bear
the
following
caption,

whatever
the
county
is
in
the

of

of

so
forth.
so
that
it
is

--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
publication
plus

mr.
seymour
b.

that
is
correct,
but
it
is
an
in

foreclosure
suit
instituted
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
county
in
which
the
properties
lie.
the
only
thing
really
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
--
the
--
a

if
--
if
there
is
no

a

is
ended
which
directs
the

to
make
out
a
deed
to
the
city
for
the
tax
parcels
involved
as
to
which
no

has
been
filed.
however,
your
honor,
there
is
no
deficiency
judgment.
you
don't
wind
up
with
a
personal
judgment
against
the
owner.
you
do
wind
up
with
a
judgment
which
directs
the
conveyance
of
those
properties
to
the
city.

mr.
seymour
b.
quel
well,
that's
the
one
which
gives
you
the
right
to
file
an
answer.
now,
as
to
what
happens
if
you
have
a
surplus,
that
section
--
or
if
you
think
you
have
a
surplus,
that
section
has
been

by

by

yes,
thank
you.
at

div.2d
895,
in
which
the
appellate

of
the
second

construed
that
as
meaning
that
in
addition
to
whatever
defenses
you
might
have
with
respect
to
the

you
could
file
a

that
the

mr.

no,
it

not,
your

the
court
of

is
our

we

this

mr.

yes.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
oh
yes,
your

mr.
seymour
b.
quel
well,
the
notice
--
again,
if
your
honor
will
turn
to
--
to
page
24
of
my
opponent's
brief,
the
appendix
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
but
they
--
but
the
bookkeeper
got
two
different
kinds
of
notices.
the
bookkeeper
got
--
the
bookkeeper
in
the
first
place
got
the
notice
of
the
taxes.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
in
addition
to
that,
the
bookkeeper
got
a
notice
that
this
foreclosure
suit
was
being
commenced
by
the
city
against
the
particular
parcels
involved.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
in
the
court.
now,
the
form
of
that
notice,
your
honor,
is
prescribed
by
the
statute
and
that
appendix
(a)
of
my
adversary's
brief
at
page
24,
you
will
see
the
way
that
notice
reads
this.
it's
--
it
had
--
it
--
it's
headed
--
incidentally,
in
reading
that,
your
honor,
if
you
would
start
just
a
little
bit
above
the
indented
matter,
such
notice
shall
be
in
substantially
the
following
form,
quote
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
"supreme
court
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
yes,
your
honor.
"supreme
court,
blank
county"
and
it
says
"notice
of
foreclosure
of
tax
liens
by
the
city
of
new
york
in
the
borrow
of,"
so
and
so.
then
it
says,
“by
action
in
rem.”
then
and
it
says,
”please
take
notice
that
on
the
blank
day
of
so
and
so,
the
treasurer
of
the
city
of
new
york,
pursuant
to
the
law
filed
that
lien.”
and
then
--
and
then
it
goes
on
in
--
in
considerable
detail
that
notice
covers
about
a
page
and
a
half
and
says,
“to
whom
it's
directed,”
and
then
--
and
then
it
says
in
substance
that
if
you
don't
come
in
and
do
something
about
the
property,
will
revert
to
the
city.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
surely.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
right.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
correct.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
appellate
division?
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
that
is
substantially
correct,
your
honor.
with
this
--
now
may
--
my
--
may
we
add
this
footnote
to
it?
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
there
isn't
any
question
irrespective
of
the
opinion
on
the
chapman
dock's
case,
that
if
you
have
a
defense
or
if
you
want
to
pay
your
taxes,
you
can
come
in
and
pay
them
before
the
expiration
period
of
20
days.
so,
the
statute
clearly
says
that
on
its
face.
the
chapman
dock's
case
was
concerned
with
the
different
situation
with
the
situation
where
a
man
for
instance
said,
“i
owe
taxes
on
this
property.
i
do
not
want
to
pay,
but
i
want
you
to
take
that
property
out
of
the
general
list
and
sell
it
at
a
separate
sale
so
that
any
surplus
from
such
sale
redound
to
my
benefit.”
that's
the
--
that
is
not
contained
in
the
statute
in
express
words.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
under
the
chapman
docks
case,
he
clearly
has.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
the
city
could
not
refuse
to
accept
the
payment
of
the
taxes.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
well,
before
the
chapman
docks
case,
we
apparently
thought
that
we
could
refuse.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
no,
not
--
not
--
we
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
--
we
did
not
appeal
with
chapman
docks
case
and
as
the
chapman
docks
case
construes
the
law,
we
cannot
now
refuse
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
yes,
your
honor,
under
the
present
statute.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
had
--
yes.
yes,
indeed,
your
honor.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
well,
the
docks
case
was
not
decided
until
this
year.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
he
could
have
done
exactly
what
the
property
owner
in
the
chapman
docks
case
did
and
presumably,
the
result
had
it
been
litigated
would
have
been
the
same.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
well,
i
would
say
this
that
there
was
some
doubt
as
to
what
the
statute
meant
before
the
chapman
docks
case
and
that
doubt
has
been
resolved
by
the
decision
therein.
but
you
see,
your
honor,
in
this
case,
the
trouble
again
was
the
bookkeeper.he
just
pocketed
these
notices
of
before
of
the
in
rem
foreclosure
and
the
trustee
says
that
he
never
got
the
notices.
and,
of
course,
we
accept
that
statement
as
true,
but
now
however
unfortunate
that
result
may
be.
so
far
as
the
question
of
due
process
is
concerned,
it's
difficult
to
see
what
more
we
could
have
done
here.
you
just
can't
show
a
personal
service
which
has
never
been
told
to
be
a
prerequisite
to
due
process
in
an
in
rem
foreclosure
suit.
there
are
all
kinds
of
tax
statutes
where
you
get
judgments
against
property,
all
sorts
of
instances
of
notices
by
publication,
which
is
the
only
notice,
which
have
been
held
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
due
process.
now,
short
of
actually
personally
serving
these
trustees,
it's
difficult
to
see
what
more
we
could
have
done
in
this
case.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
i
--
i
think
it
is.
and
i
think
that
answers
the
constitutional
objections
which
the
appellant
has
to
the
case.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
well,
they
--
they
got
up
i
think
to
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
no,
they
--
they
got
up
to
286
and
then
they
jumped
into
1
a.d.2d.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
my
associate
advises
me
that
273
app.
div.
is
1948,
your
honor.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
now
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
oh,
yes.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
surely.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
it
was,
your
honor.
oh,
yes.
i
would
like
to
mention
one
other
thing,
your
honor,
which
i
overlooked
when
i
was
discussing
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
appeal
was
moot
with
respect
to
the
larger
parcel.
the
ameliorative
statute
vests
discretions
in
the
board
of
estimate.
however,
so
far,
that
--
there
have
been
191
applications
for
the
return
of
parcels
which
were
taken.
we
have
granted
157.
we
have
not
rejected
any.
the
only
reason
that
the
others
haven't
been
granted
is
that
we're
still
investigating
when
they're
being
processed.
and
in
the
letters
which
i'm
going
to
hand
up
to,
your
honors,
there
is
the
statement
by
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
real
estate
that
he
will
recommend
to
the
board
of
estimate
that
the
application
be
granted.
now,
i
think
that
--
that
i
can
assure
the
court
that
this
application
will
be
granted.
i
mean,
i
wouldn't
ask
the
court
to
dismiss
the
appeal
as
academic
as
to
that
parcel
on
any
theory
that
the
board
of
estimate
still
had
any
discretion.
we'll
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
i'm
talking
about
discretion
to
--
discretion
to
give
them
back
their
property
after
the
foreclosure.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
well,
the
--
the
words
say
the
board
of
estimate
in
its
discretion,
but
we
--
we've
granted
every
application
so
far
and
we
do
not
propose
to
deny
this
one.i
mean,
i
just
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
surely.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
go
ahead.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
now,
i
--
i
cannot
in
--
in
fairness
say
that
because
it
does
provide
that
he
shall
pay
the
cost
that
has
a
maximum
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
--
has
a
maximum
limit
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
--
of
$500
--
$500.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
--
as
to
cost.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
well,
i
want
to
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
he
gets
the
property
back.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
that's
correct.
it
--
it
doesn't
apply
to
the
property
that's
been
sold.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
as
to
the
--
and
to
the
other
property.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
that's
correct.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
now,
your
honor,
in
--
in
fairness
to
mr.
jones,
he
does
say
in
his
brief
that
he
doesn't
want
to
do
that
because
the
way
he
construes
the
statute,
if
he
gets
the
property
back
he
says,
“we
can
keep
the
rent.
we've
been
collecting
rents
for
three
or
four
years.”
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
the
proper
construction
of
the
statute.
i'm
inclined
to
think
it
isn't,
but
that
question
is
not
before
the
court
and
i
see
no
point
in
going
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
--in
--
into
it
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
oh,
certainly
he
would.
indeed,
he
would.
if
he
pays
the
$15,000
which
represent
taxes
plus
a
small
--
and
it
was
plus
the
small
amount,
of
course,
he'll
get
this
property
back.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
is
--
is
a
matter
of
dispute
or
possible,
i
hope
not,
possible
additional
litigation.
now,
your
honors,
i
--
i've
tried
to
outline
the
procedure
here.
the
only
thing
i
can
say
in
conclusion
is
that
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
of
this
character
has
to
be
viewed
in
the
light
of
the
problem
involved.
we
have
834,000
separate
parcels
of
real
estate
in
new
york
city.
and
at
the
time
that
the
affidavits
were
presented
here,
we
had
foreclosed
against
something
like
40,000
for
delinquent
taxes
and
i'm
advised
that
we
have
proceeded
against
up
to
date,
against
something
like
57,000
parcels
and
have
acquired
title
to
them.
now,
your
honors
must
realize
also
that
in
many
instances,
arrears
of
taxes
are
relatively
small.
there
is
no
practicable
way
of
collecting
these
taxes
by
the
old
title
a
method,
because
by
the
time
you
or
it
would
take
years
and
years
and
years
to
conduct
the
necessary
title
searches
on
all
the
various
parcels
involved.
we
have
devised
by
this
method
what
we
think
is
an
expeditious
way
of
collecting
these
taxes
which
we
think
satisfies
the
requirements
of
due
process.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
that's
correct.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
57,000
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
--
of
real
--
of
real
property
have
been
foreclosed
by
this
in
rem
method.
and
since
the
ameliorative
statute
was
passed
which
was
early
this
year,
there
had
been
191
applications
for
the
return
of
properties.
i
might
say
that
under
the
ameliorative
provision,
we
may
not
dispose
of
the
property
for
a
period
of
four
months
with
reference
to
the
future.
and
within
that
four-month
period,
any
owner
can
come
in
and
make
application
for
the
return
of
the
property
upon
the
payment
of
the
back
taxes,
as
was
done
here
in
the
incidence
of
the
powell
street
property.
and
your
honor,
may
