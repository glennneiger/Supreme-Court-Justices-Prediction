justice
hugo
l.
black
i'd
like
to
see
if
i
--
is
--
is
the
first
thing
you
contend
this?
that
most
statutes
provided
with
the
collection
of
taxes
that
if
we'll
take
properly,
had
to
use
property
to
collect
these
provides
for
a
means
of
collecting
the
tax
only
and
it
simply
has
a
tax
only
out
of
the
property.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
here
they
provided
first
place
that
automatically,
they
take
the
title
to
your
property.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
do
not
limit
themselves
to
trying
to
get
the
actual
value
of
the
property
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
actual
value
of
the
tax.
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
contention
is
in
the
first
place
as
i
understand
it
is
that
violates
due
process.
that
is
quite
right
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
then,
you
say
that
--
that
material
that
even
though
they
have
taken
away
your
property,
that
might
be
what's
a
great
deal
more
than
the
amount
you
owe
on
the
taxes.
you
call
that
opponent.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
you
got
--
do
not
call
that
a
collection
tax.
is
that
what
you
keep
referring
to
as
confiscation
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
effect,
you're
saying
that
if
they
get
any
more
than
that
and
that's
all
you
own.
they're
confiscating
your
property.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
relate
to
all
of
the
properties?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
were
they
sent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
mail.
is
that
the
customary
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
--
how
do
you
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
may
i
ask
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
if
the
notice
that
you
sent
to
them
was
going
to
their
bookkeeper?
justice
hugo
l.
black
notified
of
this
particular
proceeding
in
the
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
notice,
we
--
we
had
the
notice
that
was
sent
to
us
referred
to
a
while
ago,
somewhere
in
the
record.
the
notice
in
one
set,
the
bookkeeper
got
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
what
page?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
i
think
that
--
(inaudible)
appellee's
brief
--
page
24?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
let
me
see
if
i
understand
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
it
now,
you
notified
him
of
the
tax
and
that
went
to
the
bookkeeper.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
later
notified
them
that
proceedings
were
being
started
in
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
went
to
the
bookkeeper?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
your
statute
does
not
provide
as
you
understand
it
by
reason
of
--
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
or
whichever
court,
not
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
appellate
division's
opinion.
the
statute
does
not
provide
for
an
automatic
taking
of
the
property,
but
gives
him
a
right
to
appear
in
court
after
notice,
the
notice
which
went
to
the
bookkeeper
and
see
that
his
property
is
not
taken
as
a
whole,
but
that
it
is
sold
so
that
he
can
get
any
surplus
value
out
of
his
property.
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
i'd
like
to
know.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
he
has
a
right
to
do
that
under
the
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
offered
the
chapman
docks
doctrine
as
i
understand
it
as
a
(inaudible)
his
contention
that
you
provide
for
on
automatic
taking
of
his
property
as
a
whole,
irrespective
of
the
value
of
the
property?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
still
to
use
the
question
of
the
notice
to
the
bookkeeper.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
suppose
we
could
--
we
could
pass
the
old
act
unconstitutional
on
the
grounds
it
provided
for
an
automatic
taking
of
your
property
when
it,
of
course,
has
held
at
any
time
it
doesn't
make
--
it
doesn't
provide
for
such
conditions,
couldn't
we?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
the
question
of
the
adequacy
of
the
note.
that's
a
different
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
have
a
pretty
strong
argument,
wouldn't
you,
that
they're
going
to
make
you
pay
the
taxes
as
though
it
was
your
property?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
city
certainly
ought
to
give
you
the
rent.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
at
the
cost
of
collecting.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
hope
so.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
nobody
dissented
yet.
