unknown
speaker
any
difference
water
taxes
and
real
estate
taxes?
unknown
speaker
is
it
--
it's
conceded
it
--
his
bookkeeper
had
noticed?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
conceded
they
had
to
reach
the
bookkeeper
then?
unknown
speaker
did
this
go
under
the
d17-5
that
you
have
under
appendix
a?
is
this
procedure
under
that?
unknown
speaker
page
20.
unknown
speaker
it
had
--
it
proceeded
under
that.
unknown
speaker
and
the
--
the
city
did
file
a
--
the
office
of
the
clerk
the
list?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
--
unknown
speaker
well,
do
i
understand
that
the
--
who
was
he,
a
trustee
you're
saying?
unknown
speaker
does
the
trustee
receive
in
his
own
hands
notices
of
the
--
of
--
which
specified
that
there
were
delinquencies?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
i
understood
that,
but
i
thought
you
just
said
something
in
regard
to
the
tax
bill
as
distinguished
in
the
water
bill.
unknown
speaker
and
that
the
water
bill
did
not
give
notice
of
being
delinquent.
unknown
speaker
but
they
were
tax
bills.
unknown
speaker
and
on
those
tax
bills,
there
was
notice
of
delinquencies.
unknown
speaker
arrears.
unknown
speaker
now,
and
--
where
--
did
they
come
to
the
attention
of
the
--
unknown
speaker
--
of
the
trustee?
unknown
speaker
and
with
notice
of
delinquency
he
did
not.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
arrear?
what
--
what's
the
word
do
you
use?
arrears?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
those
have
arrears.
notice
of
arrears,
he
did
nothing
about
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
was
an
indebtedness
of
the
tax
bill
that
was
sent.
it
was
a
real
estate
tax
bill
as
i
understood
you
--
unknown
speaker
--
or
did
i
misunderstood?
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
and
that
came
to
the
attention
of
the
trustee?
unknown
speaker
and
--
and
he
made
no
investigation
as
to
what
arrears
was
there
for?
unknown
speaker
what?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
he
did
testify
or
anything
of
the
case?
unknown
speaker
but
he
paid
the
--
he
paid
the
current
tax
bill,
didn't
he?
unknown
speaker
and
that
--
that
could
not
have
been
in
arrears?
unknown
speaker
but
the
word
arrears
meant
nothing
to
him
and
he
made
no
further
investigation?
unknown
speaker
now,
this
bookkeeper
that
presented
him
these
tax
bills
marked
arrears,
is
that
the
same
bookkeeper
who
you
say
owes
you
money
because
of
--
he
tried
to
cover
the
--
unknown
speaker
he
was
the
bookkeeper
in
the
administrative
office
of
the
trustee.
unknown
speaker
that's
the
way
you
do
it,
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
--
i
understand
that
--
that
this
tax
notice
that
came
to
him
was
in
itself
not
a
delinquent
tax.
unknown
speaker
for
a
current
tax
which
is
unpaid.
unknown
speaker
so,
it
couldn't
--
the
word
arrears
did
not
apply
to
the
tax
that
was
listed
on
the
notice
that
he
got.
unknown
speaker
but,
why
do
you
say
possibly?
unknown
speaker
well,
look
at
this
1705
of
page
20.
what
does
that
say?
that's
the
one
we're
operating
right
here.
unknown
speaker
now,
where
is
that?
unknown
speaker
on
page
27,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
where
is
that?
unknown
speaker
but
if
he
doesn't
know
the
address,
he
does
something
else.
unknown
speaker
nobody
does
something
else,
i
think,
files
an
affidavit
in
the
office
of
the
treasury?
unknown
speaker
do
you
do
that?
unknown
speaker
he
mailed
the
notices?
unknown
speaker
and
did
he
--
he
didn't
get
that?
the
taxpayer
never
received
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
--
what
is
your
position
to
--
to
comply
with
due
process?
there
should
be
a
proceeding
whereby
an
official
of
the
city
or
of
the
state
to
--
took
a
notice,
of
the
pending
suit
before
closure,
and
delivered
it
to
the
individual
who
made
the
return.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
--
unknown
speaker
but
could
you
--
could
you
say
that,
the
sentence
of
what
you
think
would
be
the
type
of
notice
they
should
have,
the
--
the
minimum
requirement
of
due
process?
unknown
speaker
the
--
the
property
would
have
to
be
sold,
well,
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
would
have
--
it
would
have
to
be
sold
as
though
it
were
a
foreclosure
of
an
individual
mortgage.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
whereabouts?
unknown
speaker
was
this
in
rem
a
recent
statute?
unknown
speaker
and
there's
never
been
anything
like
it
before,
go
in
rem?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
that
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
and
they
--
they
had
registered
their
name
for
that?
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
--
a
routine
matter
that
if
you
pay
a
tax
and
they
register
your
name?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
do
you
file
that
proceeding
in
--
in
a
court?
unknown
speaker
do
you
file
such
a
proceeding
in
court?
unknown
speaker
but
i
--
i
didn't
know
the
in
rem
procedure
was
in
the
courts.

speaker
(inaudible)

of
the
appellant's
brief.

speaker
there's
no
requirement
of

unknown
speaker
no
process.
unknown
speaker
is
the
judgment
entered?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
discretion
beyond
the
exemption
for
the

(voice

unknown
speaker
that's
the
discretion
there?
unknown
speaker
pardon
me.
do
you

did
i
understand
it
correctly
that

that
new
