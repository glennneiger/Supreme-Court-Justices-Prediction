mr.
william
a.
wilson
if
the
court
please.
the
petition
here
appears
to
raise
no
question
as
to
absolute
liability.
it
appears
to
raise
no
question
as
to
the
liability
of
a
vessel
owner
for
supplying
defective
appliances.
quite
clearly,
it
raises
no
question
as
to
liability
of
a
vessel
owner
for
unseaworthiness
and
no
question
as
to
the
applicability
of
the
common
law
simple
tool
doctrine.
the
only
question
that
is
before
the
court
on
this
petition
is
whether
or
not
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
its
holding
that
the
record
shows
no
proof
of
faults
on
the
part
of
the
respondent
for
the
injury
to
this
petitioner
who,
although
he
was
supplied
with
the
customary
implement
which
he
admitted
to
be
in
good
condition
for
serving
ice
cream
to
passengers
on
board
the
respondent's
vessel,
chose
on
his
own
initiative
without
knowledge,
without
consent
of
any
of
the
superiors
to
take
a
butcher
knife
that
he
himself
described
as
razor
sharp
that
was
used
customarily
by
another
member
of
the
crew
for
another
purpose
and
which
the
petitioner
himself
admitted
was
improper
for
his
crew
and
to
use
that
knife
as
a
dagger
to
stab
ice
cream
that
he
found
to
be
hard.
i
should
invite
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
fact
at
the
outset
that
there's
no
question
of
unseaworthiness
as
mr.
engelman
has
said.
this
action
has
brought
at
law.
it's
brought
for
damages
for
personal
injuries
under
the
provisions
of
the
jones
act.
there
has
been
no
claim
and
there
is
now
no
claim
that
the
respondent's
vessel
or
appliances
or
equipment
was
in
anyway
unseaworthy.
the
court
is
not
now
concerned
with
the
application
of
any
principle
of
absolute
liability
or
liability
without
cause
that
attaches
to
cases
of
unseaworthiness
under
the
rule
in
the
arseola.
now,
there
may
well
be
liability
without
cause
imposed
on
a
vessel
owner
under
the
doctrine
of
unseaworthiness
for
injuries
caused
by
unsafe
working
conditions,
but
no
case
has
been
cited
by
the
petitioner
holding
that
liability
maybe
imposed
under
the
jones
act
without
full
proof
of
negligence,
and
there
is
no
case
that
so
hold.
those
decisions
under
the
jones
act
that
place
the
vessel
owner
under
the
non-delegable
duty
to
provide
a
seaman
with
a
safe
place
to
work
go
no
further
than
to
hold
that
the
owner
is
responsible
for
the
negligence
of
a
third
person
to
whom
the
owner
has
entrusted
the
duty.
the
gist
of
this
action
is
negligence
and
an
order
to
establish
a
cause
of
action
against
this
respondent
under
the
jones
act,
the
petitioner
had
the
burden
of
proving
substantial
evidence
of
fault
on
the
part
of
the
respondent.
without
that
proof,
there
can
be
no
recovery.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
in
de
zon
against
the
american
president
lines,
made
clear
what
is
the
status
of
the
negligence
proof
required
in
a
jones
act
case,
a
case
that
was
incidentally
affirmed
in
this
court.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“we
must
be
mindful
of
the
fact
that
although
the
jones
act
has
given
a
cause
of
action
to
the
seaman
who
has
suffered
personal
injury
for
the
negligence
of
his
employer,
still
it
does
not
make
that
negligence,
which
was
not
negligence
before.
it
does
not
make
the
employer
responsible
for
acts
or
things
which
do
not
constitute
a
breach
of
duty.”
that
same
principle
has
been
stated
by
this
court
in
two
decisions
that
are
referred
to
at
page
9
of
the
respondent's
brief,
jamison
against
encarnacion
and
jacob
against
the
city
of
new
york.
that
principle
has
also
been
recognized
implicitly
in
the
socony-vacuum
oil
company
against
smith
case
that
was
referred
to
by
mr.
engelman.
i
would
like
to
refer
the
court
now
to
page
14
of
the
petitioner's
brief
at
which
point
there
is
a
quotation
from
the
socony
oil
case.
the
court
there
said
--
i'm
reading
from
the
middle
of
the
quotation
on
page
14,
“there
being
no
defense
of
assumption
of
risk
where
the
seaman
has
without
opportunity
to
use
a
safe
appliance.
it
seems
plain
that
his
choice
of
a
defective
instead
of
a
safe
one
resulting
in
injury
does
not
differ
in
either
quality
of
the
act
or
in
its
injurious
consequences
in
any
practical
way
from
his
correspondently
negligent
use
of
a
safe
or
an
unsafe
appliance
where
its
use
has
contributed
to
an
injury
resulting
from
a
breach
of
duty
by
the
owner.”
now,
the
petitioner
appears
to
contend
and
states
at
point
one
of
his
brief
that
under
the
jones
act,
there
is
absolute
liability
imposed
on
a
shipowner
for
unsafe
working
conditions.
that
conclusion
directly
contradicts
the
language
of
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
which
is
set
out
at
page
2
of
the
respondent's
brief.
that
language
reads,
“every
common
carrier
by
a
railroad
while
engaging
in
commerce
shall
be
liable
in
damages
to
any
person
suffering
injury
while
he
is
employed
by
such
carrier
in
such
commerce
or
such
injury
or
death
resulting
in
whole
or
in
part
from
the
negligence
of
any
of
the
officers,
agents
or
employees
of
such
carrier
or
by
a
reason
of
any
defect
or
insufficiency
due
to
its
negligence
in
its
cars,
engines,
appliances,
machinery
and
so
forth.”
the
conclusion
that
the
petitioner
points
at
point
one
of
his
brief
is
inconsistent
with
all
case
law
on
the
point
including
the
authorities
that
he
himself
cites
apparently
in
support
of
it.
now,
this
appears
to
be
the
petitioner's
argument
as
contained
at
page
9
of
his
brief,
the
principal
argument
upon
which
the
petitioner
seems
to
rely
in
attempting
to
reach
a
conclusion
as
to
the
shipowner's
absolute
liability
in
jones
act
cases.
petitioner
says
has
the
duty,
referring
to
the
vessel
owner's
duty
to
provide
safe
appliances
and
to
provide
for
the
seaman
a
safe
place
to
work
as
the
duty
is
non-delegable,
not
discharged
by
the
exercise
of
due
diligence
and
is
a
continuing
one
for
the
shipowner's
actual
knowledge
or
breach
of
the
duty
need
not
be
proved
for
it
is
always
imputed
to
him.
therefore,
the
mere
breach
of
the
duty
satisfies
the
negligence
requirements
of
the
jones
act.
mere
breach,
i
go
now
to
the
last
sentence
of
that
paragraph.
"mere
breach
of
the
similar
duty
to
provide
a
safe
place
to
work
satisfies
the
negligence
requirements
of
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
where
the
injury
was
sustained
on
a
property
of
another
over
which
the
railroad
had
neither
knowledge
nor
control."
i
should
like
to
discuss
briefly
the
four
decisions
which
the
petitioner
cites
in
that
paragraph
in
apparent
support
of
the
argument
that
i've
read.
first
is
pacific
american
fisheries
against
hoof,
petitioner
cites
that
apparently
in
support
of
the
proposition
that
shipowner's
actual
knowledge
of
the
breach
of
duty
need
not
be
proved
for
it
is
always
imputed
to
him.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
in
its
opinion
in
that
case
made
it
clear
that
its
decision
was
based
on
the
general
common
law
principles
of
constructed
knowledge.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“when
the
working
place
and
appliances
are
unsafe,
it
is
no
answer
to
say
that
they
were
rendered
unsafe
at
some
previous
time
by
the
act
of
another
servant."
as
already
stated,
the
duty
is
a
continuing
one
and
the
notice
of
defects
and
dangers
will
be
imputed
to
the
master
where
they
could
have
been
discovered
by
reasonable
inspection
and
by
the
exercise
of
reasonable
care.
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
the
pacific
american
fisheries
case.
second,
frey
against
the
united
states
also
cited
by
the
petitioner
in
support
of
the
points
of
that
paragraph,
in
frey
against
the
united
states
--
mr.
william
a.
wilson
that
case,
your
honor,
is
--
mr.
william
a.
wilson
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
wilson
that
case
is
cited
by
the
petitioner
on
page
9
of
his
brief
in
support
of
the
principle
that
since
the
duty
is
not
an
order,
not
discharged
by
due
diligence,
actual
knowledge
of
the
breach
of
the
duty
on
the
part
of
the
shipowner
need
not
be
proved
for
it
is
always
imputed
to
him,
involving
in
the
statement
of
the
petitioner
there
some
absolute
liability
on
the
part
of
the
shipowner
by
virtue
of
failure,
their
failure
to
provide
either
safe
appliances
or
a
safe
place
to
work.
i
refer
to
the
pacific
american
fisheries
case
in
the
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
in
that
case
as
pointing
out
that
the
vessel
owner
is
liable
only
where
such
defects
or
such
dangers
could
have
been
discovered
by
a
reasonable
inspection
and
by
the
exercise
of
reasonable
care.
in
other
words,
the
court
of
appeals,
ninth
circuit
refers
back
to
the
common
law
principles
of
negligence
in
order
to
hold
a
vessel
unreliable
under
the
jones
act.
mr.
william
a.
wilson
in
our
case,
sir?
mr.
william
a.
wilson
yes,
i
--
i
would
assume
so
from
the
charge
that
it
was,
athough
negligence
only
was
charged
in
the
complaint.
second
is
frey,
the
second
case
is
frey
against
the
united
states.
there
--
mr.
william
a.
wilson
i
can't
quite
tell,
sir.
i
don't
know
whether
it's
negligence
in
the
condition
of
the
ice
cream,
the
alleged
condition
of
the
ice
cream.
i
don't
know
whether
it's
negligence
in
an
alleged
condition
of
machinery.
i
don't
know
whether
it's
negligence
in
having
a
knife
in
the
galley.
i
don't
know
whether
it's
negligence
which
apparently
from
my
reading
on
the
briefs
seems
to
be
the
case
in
not
giving
this
second
baker
working
on
ice
cream
a
bar
tool
to
work
with,
a
multiple-pronged
ice
pick
as
it
were
that
he
could
use
to
chip
off
this
ice
cream
that
he's
described
as
hard
as
a
brickbat.
and
it
was
incidentally
when
he
described
it
as
hard
as
a
brickbat
which
apparently
nothing
can
penetrate
that
he
took
the
knife
which
he
himself
described
as
razor
sharp
in
an
attempt
to
penetrate
it.what
the
--
what
the
particular
negligence
is,
i
do
not
know,
sir.
frey
against
the
united
states
involved
that
injury
to
a
seaman
who
slipped
in
a
shower
that
was
improperly
constructed
and
there
appear
to
be
no
question
as
to
the
fact
of
improper
construction.
now
there,
the
shipowner
was
quite
obviously
charged
with
notice
of
the
defective
--
defective
condition
by
a
reason
of
the
fact
that
it
had
created
it.
but
there,
the
court
said
--
again
with
regards
to
jones
act
liability
of
a
seaman
--
of
a
shipowner,
it
is
unquestioned
that
a
seaman
may
recover
for
an
injury
caused
by
the
negligence
of
the
shipowner
in
not
providing
seaworthy
working
conditions,
going
back
virtually
to
the
actual
language
of
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
