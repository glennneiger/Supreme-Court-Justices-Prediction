earl

well,
who
was
his
immediate
supervisor,
the
chef?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
what
is
that
case,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
wilson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
--
may
i
ask
how
that
particular
citation
helps
your
case?
would
you
mind
stating
it
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
point
which
--
that
you've
read.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say
to
speed
--
as
to
speed
they
process?
chief
justice
earl
warren
which
he
had
what?
he
had
used?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
what
instruments
besides
this
--
this
scoop
does
respondent
contend
that
they're
available
for
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
it
was
equipped
right,
if
it
was
equipped
properly.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
this
respect
--
doesn't
he?
he
claims
in
this
respect
it
was
not
properly
equipped
doesn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
would
they
expect
--
what
would
they
expect
the
man
to
do,
that
he
had
a
rush
call
for
12
dishes
of
ice
cream
and
he
had
this
hard
mixture
and
no
--
no
tool
provided,
what
would
they
expect
him
do?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
on
--
there's
no
barrier
with
the
--
would
the
owner
be
entitled
to
--
to
not
provide
adequate
tools
for
--
for
a
man
to
do
that
kind
of
work
and
put
him
at
this
peril
if
he
tried
to
conform
to
the
--
to
the
general
instructions
to
--
to
use
speed
and
serve
the
--
serve
these
people
well
and
accommodate
the
waiters
and
so
forth?
would
they
expect
him
do
that
at
his
peril?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
could
they
reasonably
suppose
he
would
use?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
he
testified
that
he
couldn't
get
it
out
with
the
scoop.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
--
he
couldn't
get
it
out
because
it
was
too
hard
and
that
--
that
question
was
presented
to
the
jury
and
the
jury
decided
with
him
on
it
apparently.
was
there
--
was
there
contrary
evidence
that
this
was
adequate
to
that
occasion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
a
lot
of
these
are
on
the
kitchen
where
they're
not
dangerous,
normally,
but
it
could
cause
a
lot
of
injuries.
and
i
suppose
that
if
a
person
was
obligated
to
--
to
furnish
proper
utensils
that
he
would
have
to
anticipate
what
to
me
is
a
matter
of
the
law
that
--
that
certain
instruments
should
be
there
if
--
if
the
workman
was
required
to
do
certain
things.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may,
sir.
you
have
some
time.
