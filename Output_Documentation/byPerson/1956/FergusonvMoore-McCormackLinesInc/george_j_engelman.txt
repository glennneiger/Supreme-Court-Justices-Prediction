mr.
george
j.
engelman
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
represents
a
review
of
judgment
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
though
the
action
is
won
by
a
merchant
seaman
who
invokes
the
jones
act,
a
federal
statute
to
recover
damages
for
personal
injuries
allegedly
due
to
negligence,
the
act,
the
federal
statute,
the
jones
act,
being
one
admittedly
where
recovery
is
granted
only
for
negligence.
a
case
was
tried
before
mr.
justice
conger
and
a
jury
in
the
united
states
district
court.
at
the
end
of
the
plaintiff's
case,
the
respondent
moved
for
a
directed
verdict.
his
motion
was
denied.
the
case
went
to
the
jury
where
plaintiff
had
a
verdict
and
respondent,
defendant
below
appealed
to
the
circuit
court
and
plaintiff's
judgment
was
reversed.
mr.
george
j.
engelman
no
cause
of
action
for
unseaworthiness.
the
facts
are
substantially
these,
the
plaintiff
was
employed
as
a
member
of
a
crew
of
respondent's
vessel,
brazil,
which
was
on
a
40-day
--
42-day
cruise
to
south
america
carrying
500
first
class
passengers.
in
addition
to
his
duties
as
a
baker,
during
the
evening
meal
at
night,
he
had
the
job
of
filling
the
orders
of
waiters
for
ice
cream.
the
ice
cream
was
kept
in
the
bakeshop
adjacent
to
the
galley.
it
was
stored
in
two
and
a
half
gallon
containers
in
what
is
known
as
a
tempering
or
dispensing
chest
such
as
we
are
all
familiar
with
and
see
in
drugstores
and
confectioner
shops.
the
only
tool
with
which
he
was
furnished
was
the
usual
hemispherical
scoop
by
means
of
which
he
could
press
this
tool
into
the
ice
cream,
bring
it
up
with
a
bowl,
apply
a
liver
and
put
it
in
silver
conditions.
on
the
night
of
this
accident,
he
said
that
he
came
on
watch
and
he
had
dispensed
about
a
half
of
a
tub
of
ice
cream
which
was
of
proper
consistency
where
upon
he
proceeded
to
dispense
from
a
new
tub,
but
he
found
it
hard.
but
with
the
exercise
of
considerable
pressure,
he
was
able
to
go
down
about
halfway
in
this
tub
of
ice
cream
and
serve
it.
he
then
got
an
order
from
a
ship's
waiter
for
12
portions
of
ice
cream.
at
that
point
halfway
down,
he
found
the
ice
cream
as
he
said
as
hard
as
a
brickbat
and
the
tool,
the
scoop,
was
utterly
useless.
he
testified
that
he
had
met
with
this
situation
previously
on
ships
and
had
been
provided
with
a
tool
to
wit
an
ice
chipper
which
was
a
simple
tool
with
a
handle
and
had
six
or
eight
prongs
in
a
vertical
line.
and
that
he
would
take
this
ice
chipper
and
dig
it
into
the
ice
cream,
smashing
it
into
small
pieces
and
then
use
the
scoop
to
form
it
into
balls.
lacking
the
ice
chipper
and
seeing
no
other
tool
that
he
might
improvise
with,
he
took
a
butcher
knife
which
was
lying
nearby
in
a
brittle
and
there's
no
allegation
if
there
was
any
defect
in
the
knife
itself.
and
using
the
butcher
knife
as
a
chipper,
he
first
separated
the
hard
ice
cream
from
the
sides
of
the
container
in
order
to
get
air
in
there.
and
then
with
his
hand,
he
--
grasping
the
knife
in
sort
of
a
dagger-like
fashion,
he
proceeded
to
hack
away,
making
small
shavings
or
slivers
of
ice
cream
which
he
formed
into
bowls
by
means
of
the
scoop.
in
that
way,
he
was
able
to
make
nine
servings
of
ice
cream.
when
the
point
of
the
knife
struck
a
piece
of
ice
cream
that
was
so
hard
that
it
resisted
the
cutting
surface
and
his
hands
slipped
down
the
blade
with
the
result
that
he
was
badly
cut
and
had
an
injury
of
60%
loss
of
the
functional
use
of
his
hand.
he
testified
that
no
one
gave
him
a
specific
order
to
use
this
knife.
he
appreciated
that
it
was
not
designed
as
an
ice
chipper
and
he
appreciated
that
it
involved
certain
hazards
in
its
use.
however,
he
relied
on
the
compulsion
of
the
job,
the
fact
that
he
had
an
order
from
the
waiter.
and
he
relied
on
the
implications
in
a
general
order
which
he
got
from
his
superior
when
he
joined
the
vessel
in
which
he
was
told
that
he
was
working
on
a
first
class
passenger
vessel
and
that
he
would
have
to
give
good
service,
prompt
service
and
give
the
waiters
what
they
want.
acting
under
those
conditions,
he
used
the
knife.
now,
the
question
arises
whether
the
respondent
so
conducted
its
business
or
so
handled
this
commodity
of
ice
cream
whether
it
could
reasonably
foresee
the
need
of
an
additional
tool
which
was
not
supplied
to
wit
the
ice
chipper
or
that
in
the
alternative,
it
would
stop
serving
ice
cream
to
the
passengers.
fortunately
for
the
petitioner,
there
is
an
abundance
of
evidence
in
the
case
that
the
respondent
could
foresee
that
the
tool
it
provided
the
petitioner
with
was
totally
inadequate.
the
ice
cream
was
stored
down
in
d
deck
in
considerable
quantities
in
a
deep
freeze.
and
there,
it
was
maintained
at
a
temperature
of
5
degrees
below
zero.
a
dairy
expert
testified
that
ice
cream
of
that
kind
is
too
hard
to
be
dispensable
and
that
it
requires
being
placed
in
a
dispensing
or
tempering
chest
at
18
--
at
8
to
13
degrees
fahrenheit
above
zero
for
a
period
of
12
hours
plus,
12
to
24
hours
in
order
to
become
dispensable
or
serviceable
throughout,
because
as
it
rests
in
this
tempering
chest
or
cabinet,
the
bottom
part
is
resting
on
ice
and
it
will
fore
out
or
reach
a
consistency
for
serving
from
the
top-down.
now,
in
answer
to
interrogatories,
the
respondent
said
that
it
maintained
this
dispensing
chest
where
the
ice
cream
was
located
at
the
time
the
petitioner
was
injured.
that
it
maintained
this
chest
at
a
temperature
of
--
from
zero
to
5
to
10
degrees
which
was
too
low.
it
said
that
it
brought
up
the
ice
cream
from
down
to
d
deck
for
service
at
the
evening
meal
between
noon
and
the
time
of
the
evening
service
which
would
be
anywhere
from
5
to
8
hours,
which
was
not
a
sufficient
time.
the
respondent's
refrigerating
engineer
testified.
the
respondent
took
his
deposition
in
advance
to
trial
and
we've
read
it
in
total.
petitioner
read
it
in
support
of
his
case.
respondent
offered
no
evidence.
he
said
that
he
couldn't
say
whether
or
not
this
tempering
chest
was
in
working
order
in
condition
on
the
day
of
the
accident
or
not.
he
said
in
substance
that
they
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
with
this
device.
in
fact,
they
still
do
as
of
the
time
of
his
testimony.
and
whether
he
looked
at
it
that
day
or
not,
he
didn't
know.
he
said
that
one
of
the
difficulties
was
that
when
the
machine
was
out
of
order,
it
made
the
ice
cream
too
soft.
but
taking
all
of
that
testimony
together,
of
course,
it
seems
particularly
obvious
that
the
fact
that
the
--
from
time
to
time,
there
was
considerable
difficulty
with
the
machine
and
when
there
was
that
difficulty
with
this
tempering
chest,
it
generated
too
much
heat.
of
course,
explains
why
they
maintained
it
at
a
lower
temperature
than
they
should
have
and
why
the
ice
cream
was
not
brought
up
in
sufficient
time
for
proper
pouring
so
as
to
be
dispensable.
certainly,
on
the
basis
of
that
testimony,
the
jury
had
the
right
to
find
and
determine
if
this
respondent
could
foresee
the
need
of
some
tool
other
than
the
scoop.
the
petitioner
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
bringing
of
the
ice
cream
up,
the
handling
by
the
--
the
chest
down
on
d
deck,
the
deep
freeze
or
the
dispensing
chest
in
the
galley.
he
was
a
baker.
his
sole
job
was
to
serve
it
during
the
night
time.
mr.
george
j.
engelman
well,
i'm
--
i'm
sorry
to
say
--
mr.
george
j.
engelman
what
part
of
the
record?
mr.
george
j.
engelman
well,
that
would
be
--
mr.
george
j.
engelman
that
would
be
--
that
would
be
in
the
testimony
of
the
petitioner
in
a
general
nature.
and
specifically,
it's
in
the
first
part
of
the
record,
the
deposition
of
mr.
sam
shefrin,
the
refrigerating
engineer
of
the
respondent.
and
there
was
an
abundance
of
--
of
testimony
to
that
effect
in
there.
mr.
george
j.
engelman
yes.
the
--
we
offered
in
evidence,
there
is
on
file
in
court
the
ice
picker
or
chipper.
the
respondent
said
that
the
petitioner
could've
done
this
job
by
means
of
a
spoon.
i
think
counsel
for
the
respondent
has
it.
so
a
large
spoon,
it
appears
to
me
to
be
one
that
would
be
used
on
soup
stock
and
they
took
the
spoon.
this
is
it.
it's
of
some
substance
--
substantial
and
they
presented
it
to
the
dairy
expert
who
testified
for
the
petitioner
and
he
answered
them
that
this
would
not
be
adequate
to
attack
ice
cream
such
as
described
to
him.
now,
respondent
in
its
brief
refers
of
course
to
various
implements
that
he
might
have
found,
but
there's
not
a
scintilla
of
evidence
in
the
case
that
any
other
tool
was
available
other
than
this
butcher
knife
which
the
man
used
to
do
his
job.
the
case
was
submitted
by
judge
conger
to
the
jury
on
well-established
principles
of
maritime
law
that
the
seaman
was
entitled
to
a
safe
place
in
which
to
work.
he
was
entitled
to
adequate
tools.
he
was
entitled
to
reasonably
safe
ice
cream
in
which
to
work
and
he
was
bound
to
obey
implied
as
well
as
expressed
orders,
contributory
negligence
rule
and
proximate
cause
were
given
to
the
jury.
they
returned
the
verdict
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
on
the
ground
that
the
use
of
the
knife
was
not
within
the
realm
of
reasonable
foreseeability.
we
urge
that
in
doing
that,
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
effect
established
a
complete
--
completely
new
rule
of
law
under
which
a
shipowner
can
now
fail
to
--
to
supply
an
appliance
or
can
supply
a
defective
appliance
and
escape
liability
unless
he
can
reasonably
foresee
harm
from
the
breach
of
his
duty.
in
a
long
line
of
cases
in
the
various
united
states
courts
of
appeals,
the
various
circuits
and
in
the
decisions
of
this
court,
the
shipowner's
duty
with
respect
to
appliances
has
been
stated
that
the
duty
is
absolute,
positive,
continuous
during
the
voyage.
that
it
is
non-delegable
and
that
due
diligence
does
not
excuse
for
breach
of
the
duty.
in
other
words,
a
duty
which
has
those
attributes,
those
conditions
attached
to
it,
we
urge
that
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
shipowner
that
he
breached
the
duty
is
not
a
necessary
ingredient
of
liability.
it
is
simply
necessary
to
show
the
breach
of
the
duty
and
rest
there.
that
is
illustrated
by
two
cases,
strangely
in
the
court
below
in
the
second
circuit.
those
cases
are
a
standard
oil
versus
robins
dry
dock
&
repair
company
and
shields
versus
the
united
states.
in
the
robins
case,
the
standard
oil
had
no
possession
and
control
of
its
vessel.
the
gangway
was
defective,
but
the
standard
oil
was
found
to
be
liable
for
a
defect
in
its
gangway
even
though
it
was
out
of
--
out
of
possession
and
control.
and
in
shields
against
united
states,
which
was
liable
under
the
suits
in
admiralty
act,
the
seaman
was
injured
when
the
defect
involved
was
created
not
by
the
united
states,
in
that
case,
the
shipowner,
but
it
was
created
by
an
independent
contractor
who
came
aboard
the
vessel.
under
the
fela,
the
railroad
cases,
the
law
is
substantially
the
same
where
a
railroad
car
will
go
on
the
property
of
another
and
where
that
--
there
are
defects
and
the
railroad
man
is
injured
by
reason
of
those
defects.
now,
what
the
--
if
we
think
that
the
circuit
court
here
has
now
imposed
an
additional
--
an
additional
element
of
negligence,
it
is
no
longer
sufficient
to
show
that
the
shipowner
breached
his
duty
by
failing
to
provide
a
necessary
tool
or
by
supplying
a
hazardous
form.
you
have
to
go
further
than
that.
you
not
only
have
to
show
that
breach
of
duty,
but
you
have
to
show
that
the
shipowner
could
reasonably
foresee
that
harm
would
come
from
his
breach
of
duty
and
we
say
the
fact
is
contrary
to
the
cases.
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
below
cited
no
cases
to
support
its
premise
whatsoever.
the
three
cases
that
they
cited
were
not
in
point.
one
was
fowler
--
it's
fitzpatrick
against
fowler
which
involved
a
domestic
servant,
a
shoreside
employee
here
in
the
city
of
washington
where
assumption
of
risk
was
held
to
apply.
the
other
case
was
manhattan
versus
the
united
states
which
involved
repairmen
who
got
into
a
perfectly
sound
lifeboat
which
had
all
necessary
equipment
and
appliances
but
the
boat
was
swung
out.
and
one
of
the
workmen
carelessly
--
through
his
own
carelessness,
released
obvious
and
good
lowering
gear.
the
boat
went
into
the
water.
the
man
was
badly
injured.
in
that
case,
the
representatives
of
the
workman
claimed
that
the
boat
should've
been
lashed.
and
the
circuit
court
said,
“well
now,
it
can't
be
anticipated.
it
can't
be
foreseen
that
workman
will
be
so
careless
as
to
lower
good
gear.”
on
that
case,
on
its
facts,
is
of
course
a
sound
case,
but
it
has
no
application
whatsoever
to
our
case
here.
mr.
george
j.
engelman
not
in
a
defective
appliance
case,
sir.
not
in
a
defective
appliance
case.
the
--
the
duty,
the
obligation
upon
the
part
of
the
shipowner
to
--
to
keep
his
vessel
and
as
to
supply
all
necessary
equipment
and
appliances
and
to
repair
defects
is
a
positive
non-delegable
one.
the
breach
of
that
duty,
any
damage
that
flows
from
the
breach
of
that
duty
is
sufficient
to
establish
liability.
he
must
--
on
the
other
hand,
we
concede
that
it
is
not.
we
concede
that
the
--
the
shipowner
cannot
make
a
veritable
storehouse
out
of
his
ship
and
that
he
is
only
under
an
obligation
to
supply
those
tools
which
are
necessary.
but
once
you
have
established
the
necessity
for
a
tool,
once
you
have
it
to
that
extent,
foreseeability
is
an
element
on
the
necessity
for
the
tool.
but
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
they
haven't
held
that.
the
evidence
--
our
evidence
unmistakably
establishes
the
necessity
for
the
tool.
mr.
george
j.
engelman
yes.
mr.
george
j.
engelman
that
is
the
premise
of
my
position.
mr.
george
j.
engelman
well,
i
am
not
too
familiar
with
the
--
the
doctrine
of
master
and
servant
in
a
hotel
on
shoreside.
of
course,
those
cases
seldom
exist
because
of
compensation
acts
on
shoreside
employment.
now,
what
the
--
what
the
law
would
be
under
the
old
master
and
servant
doctrine
is
--
is
substantially
in
(inaudible)
versus
the
united
states
which
was
not
a
negligence
case.
it
was
a
--
or
mahnich
versus
the
southern
steamship
company.
this
court
reviewed
the
duty
of
a
shipowner
with
respect
to
appliances
and
referred
to
common
law.
and
as
i
take
the
court's
opinion,
i
understand
that
the
court
arrived
at
a
conclusion
that
the
duty
with
respect
to
appliance
as
of
common
law
was
positive
and
non-delegable
just
as
it
is
in
a
maritime
case.
mr.
george
j.
engelman
no,
there
was
no
--
no
evidence
to
that
effect
at
all.
the
very
--
mr.
george
j.
engelman
that
would've
been
the
only
instrument
that
could
have
satisfactorily
attacked
this
--
this
ice
cream.
it
was
a
--
a
solid
frozen
mass
and
--
mr.
george
j.
engelman
there's
no
proof
that
there
was
any
ice
pick
there.
mr.
george
j.
engelman
well,
this
man
--
of
course
we
are
dealing
as
a
practical
matter
of
going
into
the
realm
of
perhaps
speculation.
this
was
a
large
ship,
the
brazil,
i
think
of
about
35,000
tons,
that
isn't
in
the
record.
now,
here's
a
man
--
the
ship
i
think
was
500
or
600
feet
long.
here's
a
man
down
in
the
galley.
i
presume
if
we
speculate,
if
the
man
had
gone
up
to
200
or
300
feet
back
and
up
four
or
five
decks
and
spent
maybe
10
or
15
minutes
and
told
the
waiter
to
wait,
perhaps
he
could
have
and
that's
what
they
assert
in
their
brief.
he
might
have
found
some
tool
that
was
more
adaptable
or
less
hazardous
than
the
knife
which
he
finally
picked
up.
of
course,
all
of
these
things
were
argued
to
the
jury
when
the
case
was
tried.
mr.
george
j.
engelman
yes.
he
testified
that
his
immediate
supervisor
is
the
chef.
mr.
george
j.
engelman
that
is
--
mr.
george
j.
engelman
there
was
an
alternative.
they
should
have.
of
course,
as
judge
medina,
who
wrote
the
opinion
on
the
second
circuit,
he
said,
“well,
why
should
the
customers
get
frozen
ice
cream?”
the
man
was
of
course
in
a
--
in
a
dilemma.
he
had
the
orders,
not
a
specific
order,
but
he
had
the
orders
to
get
them
out,
to
--
to
give
good
service.
so,
his
alternative
was
either
to
--
to
stop
the
work
or
to
try
and
give
the
service
and
he
did
the
latter
to
his
injury.
the
--
the
same
circuit
court,
strangely,
more
than
30
years
of
going
in
a
frequently
cited
case
storgard
versus
france
&
canada
steamship
company
decided
the
precise
point
contrary
to
the
present
decision.
in
that
case,
a
seaman
was
ascending
or
had
to
go
a
loft
and
instead
of
using
a
ladder
he
used
rings
that
were
attached
to
the
sail.
a
defective
boat
was
attached
to
one
of
these
rings
and
then
using
the
ring,
he
sustained
an
injury
because
of
the
defective
boat.
and
this
is
what
the
circuit
court
said
and
i'd
like
to
read
the
three
lines.
mr.
george
j.
engelman
no.
this
is
a
maritime
case
founded
on
negligence,
a
seaman's
case.
the
circuit
--
mr.
george
j.
engelman
the
--
in
this
storgard
--
mr.
george
j.
engelman
in
the
earlier
case,
in
the
stogard
case,
the
complaint
was
a
defective
appliance.
the
shipowner
in
that
case
--
mr.
george
j.
engelman
no,
negligence.
not
unseaworthiness,
negligence.
the
shipowner
said,
“granted,
the
appliance
--
the
appliance
is
defective
in
this
particular
case,
but
we
could
not
anticipate
that
a
seaman
would
use
a
ring
rather
than
a
ladder
to
go
aloft."
in
other
words,
he
was
putting
to
use
an
appliance
for
which
it
was
not
designed
or
intended.
therefore,
we
think
the
case
supports
--
the
circuit
court
held
that
it
made
no
difference
whether
they
could
apprehend
that
a
man
would
use
the
ring
or
not,
and
they
said
“it
makes
no
difference
whether
they
use
reasonable
men,
would
not
have
apprehended
the
particular
accident
which
actually
did
happen.”
in
other
words,
we
--
we
come
back
to
our
premise
that
foreseeability,
foreseeability
of
harm
in
a
defective
appliance
case
or
in
the
lack
of
an
adequate
appliance
is
not
a
necessary
element
of
negligence.
mr.
george
j.
engelman
well,
my
last
--
mr.
george
j.
engelman
my
last
point
in
the
case
is
that
all
of
these
matters
were
submitted
to
the
jury
and
the
jury
answered
all
questions
and
all
points
and
therefore,
we
had
a
jury
verdict.
that
comes
about
in
this
way,
the
judge
did
not
charge
the
jury
that
in
order
for
the
respondent
to
be
liable,
he
must
reasonably
foresee
that
petitioner
would
use
the
knife.
but
what
the
judge
did
charge
was
very,
very
close
to
that.
he
said,
“one
of
the
elements
the
jury
might
consider
was
whether
the
respondent
could
have
anticipated
on
all
of
the
evidence,
all
the
facts
in
the
case
whether
respondent
--
whether
the
petitioner
would
use
the
knife.
so,
the
verdict
was
a
general
one
and
that
question
stands
answered
in
the
affirmative.
the
--
the
doctrine
of
reasonable
foreseeability,
we
know
of
no
case
where
it's
been
applied
before.
in
the
two
cases
of
this
court,
seemed
to
clearly
call
for
the
application
of
the
doctrine.
one
was
socony-vacuum
oil
company
versus
smith
which
we
tried
in
the
--
in
the
district
court
and
argued
here.
there,
a
seaman
had
a
choice
between
a
sound
seaworthy
floor
plate
and
a
defective
step
plate.
he
knew
the
step
plate
to
be
defective.
without
any
specific
order,
he
voluntarily
chose
to
use
the
defective
plate.
he
had
a
free
and
un-coerced
choice.
mr.
justice
stone
held
there
was
negligence
in
failing
to
supply
proper
equipment
and
the
choice
of
defective
equipment
in
place
of
non-defect
--
or
the
use
of
defective
equipment
in
place
of
adequate
equipment
was
simply
a
matter
of
the
seaman's
contributory
negligence.
on
that
case,
a
very
experienced
maritime
counsel
argued
the
cause
and
briefed
it
for
the
socony-vacuum
oil
company
and
the
doctrine
of
foreseeability
of
harm
was
not
even
discussed
by
counsel,
was
never
raised.
the
point
that
was
raised
in
the
chamber
of
this
court
on
the
question
of
assumption
of
risk.
it
seems
that
--
that
the
shipowner
has
ample
protection
in
the
contributory
negligence
rule.
this
case
we
believe
illustrates
that,
a
man
recovered
a
verdict
of
$17,500
for
60%
loss
of
his
hand
which
permanently
disabled
him
from
his
occupation.
the
medical
testimony
is
not
reputed
in
any
way.
and
as
a
practical
matter,
the
rule
announced
by
the
circuit
court
certainly
is
not
going
to
help
the
careful
shipowner,
the
shipowner
who
keeps
his
appliances
and
equipment
in
a
safe
and
proper
condition.
the
rule
will
help
the
shipowner
who
doesn't.
he
is
the
man
who
will
attempt
to
excuse
his
breach
of
duty
by
saying,
“i
did
not
supply
proper
equipment
here.
i
failed
to
supply
equipment
there.
but
it
was
not
within
the
realm
of
my
foreseeability
that
this
particular
accident
occurred.”
with
the
end
result,
the
rule
would
result
in
the
impairment
of
the
efficiency
of
our
merchant
marine.
it
would
give
rise.
courts
and
juries
would
make
such
--
or
certainly,
juries
would
arrive
at
such
diverse
interpretation
of
where
foreseeability
lay
with
respect
to
the
enumerable
ship's
appliances
that
the
law
of
appliances
would
end
up
as
a
hunch
punch
and
hardly
any
shipowner
would
know
what
he
had
to
supply
and
what
he
didn't
have
to
supply.
now,
as
my
second
point
is,
the
simple
tool
doctrine
of
this
appliance,
the
--
the
absence
of
the
ice
chipper
of
course
is
a
simple
tool.
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
did
not
refer
to
the
simple
tool
doctrine
or
did
not
refer
to
the
appliances
as
simple
tools.
the
common
law,
the
simple
tool
doctrine
to
wit
of
the
servant
used
defective
simple
tools
at
his
own
peril
is
--
was
based
on
the
law
of
assumption
of
risk
that
he
assumed
the
risk.
he
was
a
shoreside
worker.
he
could
walk
off
the
job
if
he
wished.
he
could
bring
his
own
tools.
the
last
pronouncement
this
court
made
in
a
simple
tool
case
was
jacob
versus
the
city
of
new
york.
and
in
that
case,
the
maritime
bar
without
any
question
feels
that
this
court
abolished
the
simple
rule
doctrine.
there,
a
--
an
engineer
had
a
monkey
wrench
which
this
court
said
was
probably
adequate
for
the
job.
however,
for
his
particular
work,
there
was
aboard
ship
a
more
adaptable
type
of
wrench
and
that
was
worn
and
defective.
three
requests
for
a
new
wrench
had
been
made
and
had
not
been
complied
with.
instead
of
using
the
monkey
wrench,
he
used
the
defective
wrench
and
he
sustained
injury.
again,
the
second
circuit
dismissed
this
case
holding
that
there
was
no
insufficiency
of
appliances
and
applying
the
simple
tool
doctrine.
this
court
held
that
the
evidence
--
on
the
evidence,
there
was
a
jury
question
as
to
whether
there
was
any
defect
or
insufficiency
in
the
ship's
appliances.
mr.
george
j.
engelman
that
case
is
jacob
versus
the
city
of
new
york,
315
u.s.
752.
now,
with
some
language
used
of
the
question
that
i'm
attempting
to
get
at,
whether
--
whether
the
rule
of
foreseeability
which
the
second
circuit
engrafted
on
to
the
--
to
defective
appliance
rule,
whether
this
foreseeability
rule
is
engrafted
on
in
the
case
of
simple
tools.
now,
in
that
jacob's
case,
this
court
did
use
language.
it's
the
first
time
i
found
it
in
any
of
the
decision
of
this
court
or
in
any
decision
that
i
have
been
able
to
find
in
any
of
the
circuits,
did
use
language
with
respect
to
foreseeability
and
this
is
what
it
said
referring
to
the
--
referring
to
what
the
jury
may
have
found
with
respect
to
negligence
of
respondent,
the
shipowner
had
said.
it
said
this.
“whether
respondent,
after
it
had
knowledge
of
the
defect
might
not
have
reasonably
foreseen
a
possibility
of
resulting
harm,
if
it
allowed
the
worn
wrench
to
remain
in
use.”
now,
we
concede
there
that
foreseeability
was
an
element,
one
of
the
elements
of
negligence
in
the
case
because
a
request
for
another
wrench
should've
been
made
on
three
different
times,
but
we
say
that
it
was
not
the
necessary
element.
in
a
sense,
it
was
a
superfluous
element
of
negligence.
the
primary
negligence
consisted
in
permitting
the
worn
wrench
to
remain
in
use
a
careful
shipowner
properly
supervising
his
equipment
with
safe
and
competent
officers
would
not
have
permitted
the
worn
wrench
to
remain
in
use.
so,
we
say
that
--
or
urge
that
the
primary
duty
of
safe
appliances,
a
proof
of
that
and
nothing
else,
is
sufficient
in
a
simple
tool
case
such
as
we
have
here
as
well
in
case
--
as
well
as
in
cases
of
general
appliances.
now,
the
socony
case,
socony-vacuum
oil
company
versus
smith,
it's
debatable
whether
the
tool
was
a
simple
one.
it
was
a
small
step
plate
or
about
six
by
six
but
it
was
a
fixed
tool
pillar.
and
in
a
sense,
it
was
a
simple
tool.
now,
we
see
--
we
can
see
no
reason
why
in
the
case
of
simple
tools,
the
doctrine
of
foreseeability
of
harm
from
breach
of
duty
and
not
appliance
cases
should
exist
when
it
clearly
doesn't
exist
on
the
authorities
in
other
cases,
cases
other
than
simple
tools.
the
result
that
would
be
reached
if
you
did
have
this
doctrine
engrafted
on
the
foreseeability,
if
you
go
back
and
take
the
plaintiff's
position
or
his
dilemma
that
confronted
him,
his
alternatives
would
be
either
to
throw
the
scoop
down
and
not
do
any
work
at
all
or
he'd
be
--
have
the
obligation
when
he
went
aboard
the
ship
to
bring
his
own
tools,
because
he'll
be
in
a
position
where
he
could
not
rely
on
the
shipowner
to
supply
his
tools.
and
again,
in
the
jacob's
case,
the
--
this
court
sharply
criticized
the
--
the
proposition
of
a
simple
tool
doctrine
of
common
law
where
it
was
born
and
invoked,
shoreside
cases
that
they
won
such
as
a
seaman
who
moves
about
the
world
should
bring
aboard
ship
his
own
tools.
mr.
george
j.
engelman
well,
it's
a
combination.
it's
a
--
it's
a
combination
of
circumstances,
the
--
one
of
the
elements
of
negligence.
mr.
george
j.
engelman
well,
the
--
the
case
on
the
question
of
proximate
cause,
i
think
the
knife,
the
use
of
the
knife
comes
in.
true,
there
was
negligence,
but
i
don't
think
this
--
this
was
not
questioned.
an
accident
report
was
made
immediately
after
the
accident,
but
practically
no
facts
in
dispute.
the
man
had
hard
ice
cream.
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
now,
the
--
the
question
of
--
of
foreseeability
with
respect
to
the
tool,
i
think
arises
out
of
the
--
the
issue
of
the
proximate
cause
of
the
accident.
mr.
george
j.
engelman
oh,
yes
it
was
--
i
think
it
was.
judge
conger
decided
that
this
--
this
man
was
entitled
to
a
reasonably
safe
commodity
on
which
to
work.
of
course,
hard
ice
cream
per
se
is
not
a
negligent
condition.
mr.
george
j.
engelman
that
is
it,
absolutely,
yes
sir.
the
--
on
the
third
point
with
respect
to
the
decision
of
the
circuit
court
is
that
it
invokes
the
defense,
the
shipowner
of
assumption
of
risk.
in
effect,
what
the
circuit
court
held
was
that
the
petitioner
in
using
this
knife
to
perform
his
duty
assumed
the
risk
of
the
use
of
a
hazardous
tool
when
a
necessary
one
was
not
provided.
now
again,
coming
back
to
the
fundamental
socony-vacuum
versus
oil
--
the
smith
case,
this
court
abolished
the
defense
of
assumption
of
risk
in
seaman's
cases.
and
in
the
concluding
question
that
we
asked
here,
is
the
defense
of
assumption
of
risk
also
abolished
in
simple
tool
cases?
mr.
justice
stone,
at
the
conclude
--
conclusion
of
his
opinion
in
the
socony-vacuum
oil
versus
smith
case
made
a
statement
with
respect
to
the
class
of
cases
that
was
not
covered
by
the
decision
of
the
court,
and
this
is
what
he
said.
“we
leave
to
future
cases
as
they
may
arise,
the
determination
of
what
rule
is
to
apply
in
cases
where
the
seaman's
election
to
use
an
unsafe
appliance
is
in
disobedience
of
orders
or
made
while
not
on
duty.”
he
left
the
door
open
on
disobedience
of
orders
and
the
use
of
--
voluntary
use
of
defective
appliances
that
in
those
two
class
of
cases,
nothing
was
said
or
indicated
that
the
court
would
reach
a
different
rule
in
simple
tool
cases."
now,
following
that
decision,
congress
in
the
federal
employers'
liability
act,
a
section
which
we
have
quoted
in
our
brief,
45
u.s.c.a.
54
abolished
the
defense
of
assumption
of
risk.
the
language
of
the
statute
merely
refers
to
the
negligence
of
any
of
the
officers,
agents
or
employees
of
such
carrier.
and
of
course,
that
act
is
incorporated
into
the
jones
act
by
reference.
the
act
also
refers
to
any
statute
enacted
for
the
safety
of
employees.
there
is
no
such
statute
with
respect
to
seaman
that
we
know
of.
the
--
the
situation
on
--
on
a
parity
of
--
or
an
ironic
comparison
basis,
certainly,
the
petitioner
here
was
in
a
far
more
difficult
position
than
smith
was
in
the
socony-vacuum
oil
company
case.
smith
had
a
good
floor
plate.
he
had
no
specific
orders.
he
was
not
hurried
up.
he
was
just
performing
routine
duties
of
oil.
he
knew
this
plate
was
defective.
apparently,
he
forgot
about
it.
he
got
on
it
and
he
was
injured.
he
had
very
little
--
his
only
compulsion
was
a
compulsion
of
his
job,
whereas
the
petitioner
here
had
the
more
pressing
or
immediate
compulsion
of
his
job,
his
work.
he
had
a
specific
order
for
12
servings
of
this
ice
cream
and
he
had
his
general
orders.he
was
to
get
the
work
out
and
give
good
service.
we
think
that
to
apply
any
different
rule
because
the
tool
involved
was
a
simple
one,
would
be
an
--
unjust.
and
of
course
further
and
our
final
point
is
that
the
jury
verdict,
the
general
jury
verdict
on
the
basis
of
the
court's
charge
was
a
finding
that
this
man
had
an
implied
order
to
use
the
knife.
it's
what
the
jury
found
and
it
was
a
clear
finding
under
the
judgment
--
judges'
charge.
nothing
is
more
bedrock
in
maritime
law
pertaining
to
seaman
than
the
duty
of
obeying
expressed
as
well
as
implied
orders.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
same
second
circuit,
not
long
ago
in
the
darlington
case
said
the
case
--
cases
make
it
clear
with
the
safety
of
ships
at
sea
might
be
in
seriously
danger
but
the
rule
otherwise.
now,
the
cases
cited
by
my
friend
are
cases
that
deal
with
transitory
substances.
they
are
the
grease
and
oil
cases,
the
foreign
substance
cases
where
someone
without
knowledge
may
spill
gravy,
grease,
banana
peels
or
some
other
substance.
there
is
no
proof
that
the
shipowner
had
knowledge
or
an
opportunity
to
correct
the
condition.
and
of
course,
there,
the
cases
at
the
present
time
while
there
are
some
cases
permitting
recovery
very
recently
on
the
basis
of
unseaworthiness,
those
cases
properly
hold
that
there
is
no
liability
under
the
jones
act
because
there's
no
negligence.
there
is
no
knowledge
that's
brought
home
to
the
employer.
but
here,
we
have
a
situation
where
a
careful
prudent
shipowner
would
supply
the
necessary
tools,
the
need
for
something
in
addition
to
that
scoop,
the
sole
tool
with
which
the
petitioner
was
provided.
the
evidence
abundantly
beyond
question
shows
the
need
and
the
necessity.
now,
when
they
breach
that
duty,
he
was
ordered
to
use
hard
ice
cream
and
he
didn't
have
a
tool
to
tackle
hard
ice
cream.
that
was
the
negligence.
and
we
say
that
the
shipowner
as
the
jury
found
is
responsible
for
anything
that
flows
from
that,
and
they
shouldn't
be
superimpose
something
else,
the
nebulous
something
and
vested
the
most
nebulous
speculative
concept
that
the
shipowner
must
foresee
that
out
of
his
breach,
there's
a
possibility
that
harm
may
come
over.
we
think
it
would
be
the
ultimate
confusion,
overrides
established
decisions.
mr.
george
j.
engelman
if
the
court
please,
might
i
very
reach
the
--
mr.
george
j.
engelman
unfortunately,
my
friend
might
have
tried
the
case
in
the
district
court
nor
argued
it
in
the
circuit
court.
consequently,
he
is
not
familiar
with
the
evidence.
now,
with
respect
to
the
knife
and
the
scoop
about
which
the
court
required,
both
of
those
articles
were
the
ship's
property.
on
the
trial
of
the
case,
neither
of
those
instruments
were
produced.
now
first,
with
respect
to
the
knife,
counsel
has
indicated
that
there
was
available
another
knife
with
a
guard,
a
french
knife.
the
record
is
completely
barren
that
there
was
any
such
knife
with
the
guard
available.
the
evidence
to
which
counsel
refers
is
on
page
60
and
61
of
the
record
on
the
bottom
of
the
page
and
on
the
top
of
the
page.
and
the
witness
is
referring
to
the
use
of
the
knife
on
another
vessel,
not
on
this
particular
vessel.
now,
with
respect
to
the
scoop
itself,
petitioner
produced
the
dairy
expert.
he
wasn't
even
asked
by
trial
counsel
for
the
respondent
whether
the
scoop
could
have
scooped
out
or
shaved
out,
as
counsel
implies,
slivers
of
this
ice
cream.
so
that
those
issues,
there
were
no
issues
of
that
kind
at
all.
the
case
stood
squarely
on
the
fact
that
the
scoop
was
an
inadequate
tool,
completely
inadequate
and
there
was
no
request
to
charge
that
there
was
available
any
other
knife
which
had
a
protective
device
which
the
knife
which
was
used
did
not
have.
now,
with
respect
to
how
this
ice
cream
got
to
be
hard,
who
was
responsible
for
it?
it
was
clearly
the
negligence
of
a
fellow
servant.
the
testimony
of
the
plaintiff
is
that
the
third
baker
or
one
of
the
personnel
in
the
steward's
department
of
the
ship
was
charged
with
the
responsibility
as
to
the
quantity
of
ice
cream
that
was
to
be
brought
up,
placed
in
this
tempering
chest
for
thawing
when
it
was
to
be
brought
up,
quantity
of
it.
the
third
baker
in
turn
had
a
superior,
the
chef
who
issued
orders.
so,
on
the
evidence,
as
it
stands,
it's
clearly
the
case
of
negligence
of
a
fellow
servant.
the
jury
might
have
drawn
that
inference
or
as
i
said,
in
my
main
argument,
the
absence
of
proper
mechanical
equipment
aboard
ship
to
soften
this
ice
cream
to
a
point
where
it
was
properly
dispensable.
and
the
evidence
with
respect
to
the
third
baker
is
found
on
page
50
of
the
record.
a
--
a
question
was
asked
as
to
whether
this
was
one
of
the
novel
impression
with
respect
to
ice
cream
and
it
is.
there
is
a
case
that
is
not
cited
by
either
counsel
in
brief,
in
which
a
shipowner
strangely
again
by
the
same
circuit
--
second
circuit
was
found
liable
in
negligence
to
a
longshoreman,
a
number
of
them
who
sustained
dermatitis
as
a
result
of
the
bad
properties
of
threshing
that
oil
has
that
propensity.
and
the
shipowner
said,
“well,
we
didn't
know
anything
about
that
that
these
drums
of
threshing
that
oil
leaked
and
all
these
longshoremen
got
dermatitis
as
a
result
of
this
commodity.
and
the
second
circuit
held
that
the
shipowner
was
charged
as
a
third
party
case,
was
charged
with
knowledge
of
the
properties
of
this
commodity,
what
they
could
have
learned
had
they
employed
people
who
were
skillful
in
the
trade
and
could
have
informed
them
about
it.
that
is
the
only
other
case
i
know.
the
citation
is
it's
anderson
versus
lorentzen,
l-o-r-e-n-t-z-e-n
160
f.2d
173.
with
respect
to
the
main
point
in
the
analysis
of
my
authorities,
i
don't
think
that
i
have
made
myself
clear
to
my
adversary.
i
concede
of
course
that
no
ship
can
be
a
storehouse
of
a
vast
number
of
tools
and
equipment
that
the
duty
to
supply
a
tool
can
only
arise
out
of
the
nature
of
the
business
and
reasonable
foreseeability.
therefore,
in
absence
of
tool
cases,
there
must
always
be
negligence.
here,
on
the
evidence
i've
described,
the
jury
found
that
negligence,
that
failure
to
provide
a
tool.
once
we
have
the
breach
of
the
duty,
then
foreseeability
is
out
of
the
picture
because
anything
that
flows
from
the
--
from
breach,
there
is
liability.
