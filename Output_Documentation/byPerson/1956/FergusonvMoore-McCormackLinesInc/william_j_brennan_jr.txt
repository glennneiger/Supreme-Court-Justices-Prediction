what
do
you

by
a
mechanical
ice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
what
a
scoop
is,
but
that
--
you
mean
it's
driven
by

would

would
only
operate
in
soft
ice
cream.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
perhaps
it's
easy
to
--
he
couldn't
operate
in
the
--
to
dip
down
into
a
block
of
ice
cream.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whose
duty
was
it
to
soften
the
ice
cream?
does
the
record
show
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it's
not
his
duty
to
see
that
the
ice
cream
was
up
in
time
to
be
soft?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
inference
is
clear,
i
gather,
or
at
least
jury
of
reasonable
men
might
draw
the
inference
that
it
was
someone's
duty
not
to
bring
it
up
until
it
was
tempered.
you
offered
no
evidence
of
that
kind.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
page
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
the
shipowner
offered
no
testimony
of
any
kind?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
towards
the
plaintiff's
case.
well
that
--
certainly,
the
jury
could
find,
could
it
not,
that
the
ice
cream
was
hard
when
the
petitioner
made
use
of
this
knife
to
break
it
up.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
could
not
the
jury
also
infer
in
the
absence
of
any
testimony
at
all
on
the
part
of
the
shipowner
that
in
its
hard
condition,
an
inference
might
be
drawn
that
someone
had
been
negligent
somehow,
not
this
petitioner
but
some
other
employee.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
what
--
what
significance
then
is
any
of
the
evidence
as
to
the
tempering
chest?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
my
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
--
i
asked
you,
is
that
--
is
that
of
any
importance
if
reasonably,
a
jury
might
infer
in
the
absence
of
any
other
explanation
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
the
mere
hard
condition
of
the
ice
cream
indicated
that
someone
had
been
negligent.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
my
question
is
--
my
question
is,
did
the
petitioner
have
any
burden
to
show
in
what
way
the
hard
condition
resulted
from
some
particular
kind
of
negligence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
was
enough
merely
that
it
was
hard
to
justify
a
jury
to
infer
that
there
had
been
negligence
not
on
his
part
but
on
the
part
of
someone
else.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me,
mr.
wilson,
i
gather
there's
enough
however
in
the
plaintiff's
case
to
justify
an
inference
or
at
least
perhaps
a
difference
of
view
among
reasonable
men
that
something
would
be
used
by
an
employee
under
the
duty
as
this
evidence
indicates
this
petition
was
to
serve
the
ice
cream
finding
that
that
to
be
was
difficult
because
of
its
hardness
and
finding
as
well
as
half
of
evidence
is
uncontradicted
that
he
did
that
the
ordinary
scoop
would
not
suffice.
so,
wouldn't
a
jury
be
justified
in
inferring
that
at
least
the
employer
had
reason
or
should
reasonably
had
anticipated
that
he'd
use
something.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
that's
then
to
say,
isn't
it
that
it's
sufficient
that
it
should
have
realized,
the
employers
should
have
realized
that
something
be
used,
is
not
necessary
for
the
petitioner
to
establish
that
the
employer
should
have
realized
that
this
knife
or
a
knife
should
be
use.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
doesn't
your
argument
really
come
down
to
a
question
whether
in
choosing
the
knife,
the
petitioner
choose
something
which
perhaps
as
a
matter
of
contributory
negligence,
he
should
not
have
picked
for
the
purpose?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
something
that
he
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
quite
understand
how
you
can
see
that
on
these
circumstances
an
inference
that
he
would
use
something
when
the
scoop
didn't
work
was
something
that
the
employer
could
reasonably
expect
that
to
have
foreseen.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
doesn't
say
that
when
he
picked
the
knife
that
the
foreseeability
that
he
would
use
something
stopped
short
of
that.
i
don't
follow
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
how
--
how
can
you
help
when
you
say
that?
you
offered
no
proof.
the
ice
cream
was
hard
and
i
thought
you
admitted
earlier
that
from
the
fact
that
it
was
hard,
how
the
jury
could
properly
infer
that
the
negligence
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
(voice
overlap)
--
the
petitioner.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
that
--
am
i
correct
that
the
employer
did
not
ground
the
motion
for
directed
verdict
than
any
--
contribute
to
alleged
contributory
negligence
of
the
