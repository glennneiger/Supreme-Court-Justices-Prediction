there
is
no
cause
of
action
for
unseaworthiness.
justice
john
m.

mr.
engelman,
one
of
the
things
that
puzzle
me.
in
your
brief,
you
say
there
was
uncontradicted
proof
showing
that
the
tempering
chest
was
not
in
proper
order
and
your
opponent
says
there's
no
proof
whatever.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
wondering
where
the
record
shows
which
of
you
is
right
on
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
don't
take
time
from
your
argument.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
claim
that
the
rule
in
this
respect
under
a
jones
act
case
is
different
for
what
it
is
in
an
ordinary
negligence
action?
foreseeability
is
not
an
element
of
that
--
a
cause
of
action
under
your
jones
--
the
jones
act
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
your
point
is
that
a
--
this
ice
cream
pick
was
just
as
essential
to
the
proper
equipment
to
the
ship
as
a
life
boat.
that's
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
that's
the
premise
of
your
position.
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
there
any
other
evidence
that
the
ship's
equipment,
the
galley
equipment,
it
included
an
ice
cream
pick
at
any
time
in
its
maritime
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
stand
and
fall
on
that?
in
other
words,
supposing
we
disagree
with
you
as
to
the
applicable
rule
of
law.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
decision
all
right
then?
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
there
any
special
gadget
that
is
made
which
should
be
out
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
far
as
ice
cream,
yes.
is
there
such
a
thing?
i
don't
know.
justice
john
m.
harlan
for
chipping
out
frozen
ice
cream.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
know
about
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
but
i've
never
heard
of
one
that
chipped
the
ice
cream.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
any
evidence
that
anybody
besides
this
petitioner
knew
that
the
ice
cream
was
hard?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
--
this
bread
knife
we've
been
taking
about,
was
it
one
of
these
thin
knives
with
a
flexible
blade?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
french
bread
knives
that
i
have
seen,
they're
like
you
almost
lay
them
around.
they're
flexible.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
it
has
anything
to
the
--
your
opponent's
case
for
the
circumstance
that
this
fellow
was
a
baker?
justice
john
m.
harlan
serving
ice
cream
and
the
bakers
usually
use
bread
knives?
