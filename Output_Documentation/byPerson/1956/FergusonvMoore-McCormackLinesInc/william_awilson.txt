mr.
william
a.wilson
--
to
two
of
the
case
authorities
mentioned
by
the
petitioner
in
support
of
the
position
expressed
at
page
9
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
i
should
like
now
to
refer
briefly
to
the
third
of
those
cases,
terminal
railway
association
against
fitzjohn
which
petitioner
cites
in
support
of
the
statement
that
mere
breach
of
the
similar
duty,
again
referring
to
the
shipowner's
duty
to
provide
safe
appliances
and
to
provide
a
safe
place
to
work,
satisfies
the
negligence
requirements
of
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
where
the
injury
was
sustained
on
the
property
of
another
over
which
the
railroad
has
neither
knowledge
nor
control.
in
the
fitzjohn
case
which
was
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit,
there
was
a
question
as
to
a
portion
of
the
trial
judge's
charge
to
the
jury.
the
court
said,
"complaint
is
made
concerning
a
statement
of
the
trial
court
in
its
charge
to
the
jury,
that
it
was
the
duty
of
a
railroad
company
to
furnish
its
employees
with
a
reasonably
safe
place
in
which
to
work."
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
inclusion
of
that
sentence
in
the
charge
was
not
error
because
--
and
i
read
again
from
the
opinion,
later
in
the
charge,
when
the
court
came
to
charging
the
jury
specifically
respecting
the
basis
of
defendant's
liability,
the
following
language
was
used.
it
was
the
duty
of
the
st.
louis
terminal
railroad
association
to
use
reasonable
care
to
provide
a
reasonably
safe
place
for
its
employees
to
work.
the
last
of
those
four
cases
is
storgard
against
france
&
canada
steamship
corporation
cited
by
the
petitioner
in
support
of
his
statement
that
mere
breach
of
the
duty
satisfies
the
negligence
requirements
of
the
jones
act.
the
storgard
case
was
decided
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
1920
and
was
--
and
referred
to
a
judgment
entered
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
in
1918,
and
two
years
before
the
jones
act
was
enacted.
the
storgard
case
referred
to
the
entitlement
of
a
seaman
to
recover
damages
for
injuries
that
he
allegedly
sustained
as
a
result
of
a
defective
bolt
on
a
mast
of
the
defendant's
vessel.
the
petitioner
has
quoted
certain
language
from
the
storgard
case
at
the
foot
of
page
10
of
its
brief
referring
particularly
to
the
doctrine
of
reasonable
foreseeability
to
which
i
should
like
to
come
later
in
argument.
but
at
the
present
time,
i
should
like
to
refer
the
court
to
the
full
text
of
the
sentence
in
which
the
fragment
quotation
at
the
foot
of
page
10
is
taken.
there,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“if
the
bolts
was
worn
and
defective
and
the
shipowners
knew
or
ought
to
have
known
the
fact
then
they
considered
that
the
seaman
would
be
entitled
to
recover
damages
for
injuries
as
a
result.”
the
respondent
submits
that
not
one
of
the
four
cases
cited
under
the
section
to
which
i
referred
the
court
before
the
recess
supports
the
principle
proposed
by
the
petitioner
that
there
is,
in
any
sense,
an
absolute
liability
cast
upon
a
vessel
owner
under
the
provisions
of
the
jones
act.
respondent
submits
that
the
principles
which
controlled
the
question
of
recovery
or
not
in
the
jones
act
case
are
those
general
common
law
principles
that
control
the
question
of
recovery
or
not
in
any
common
law
negligence
action.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
was
error
here
for
the
trial
court
to
deny
the
respondent's
motion
for
a
directed
verdict.
in
its
opinion,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“there
being
no
proof
of
fault
on
the
part
of
a
shipowner,
defendant's
motion
for
a
directed
verdict
should
have
been
granted.
the
respondent
submits
that
the
record
fully
supports
that
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
respondent
negligently
failed
to
provide
the
petitioner
with
this
proper
tools
for
his
work.
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
respondent
was
negligent
by
reason
of
any
defect
of
machinery.
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
respondent
had
any
reason
to
foresee
in
the
circumstances
the
possibility
of
any
danger
to
the
petitioner.
in
the
first
place,
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
respondent
failed
to
furnish
the
petitioner
with
proper
tool.
the
petitioner
was
furnished
with
a
mechanical
ice
cream
scoop,
a
standard
design
that's
used
commercially
for
serving
ice
cream.
there
is
no
contention
here
on
petitioner's
part
that
that
scoop
was
in
any
way
defective.
mr.
william
a.wilson
he
should
have
stopped,
sir,
or
he
should
have
invited
the
attention
of
the
superiors
to
the
condition.
one
thing
we
do
say
is
that
he
should
not
have
picked
up
the
knife
which
he
says
was
a
razor-sharp
and
used
it
for
the
purpose
for
which
he
did
and
in
a
manner
in
which
he
did
use
it.
mr.
william
a.wilson
the
ice
cream
scoop
that
was
used
which
--
mr.
william
a.wilson
no,
sir.
it
--
it
had
a
little
lever
that
was
activated
by
the
thumb
which
caused
a
clearance
device
to
release
the
ball
of
ice
cream
from
the
--
mr.
william
a.wilson
it
would
operate,
sir.
mr.
william
a.wilson
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
necessarily
agree.
the
respondent
doesn't
necessarily
agree
that
it
would
operate
only
in
soft
ice
cream,
sir.
perhaps
it
might
operate
more
efficiently
in
hot
ice
cream
so
far
as
its
releasing
capabilities
are
concerned.
mr.
william
a.wilson
to
dip
down,
no,
sir.
to
scrape,
yes
sir.
it
has
quite
a
sharp
edge
on
it
on
a
circumference
--
the
circumference
of
its
lip,
don't
we
have
it?
the
--
so
the
petitioner
chose
to
speed
the
process
by
taking
this
sharp
knife
which
was
kept
under
the
nearby
griddle
for
another
purpose
and
to
use
it
to
loosen
the
ice
cream.
mr.
william
a.wilson
he
chose
to
speed
the
process.
he
chose
to
hurry
the
process
and
in
that
connection
may
i
refer
the
court
to
the
language
of
the
record
at
page
72
where
there
is
included
a
passage
from
pretrial
testimony
given
by
the
petitioner
in
the
action.
the
question
now
--
just
a
couple
of
more
questions
mr.
ferguson
to
get
back
to
the
accident.
when
you
found
that
this
ice
cream
was
hard,
did
you
know
that
this
knife
to
which
you
refer
was
right
there
nearby?
answer:
that
is
where
they
always
kept
it.
question:
and
you
just
reached
now
and
got
the
knife?
answer:
because
i
was
in
a
hurry,
yes.
now,
this
petitioner
was
standing
in
the
galley
of
a
large
passenger
vessel,
one
of
the
largest
us
flag
passenger
vessel.
that
galley
was
equipped
to
serve
500
passengers.
that
petitioner
testified
that
there
was
no
other
instrument
available
to
him
in
the
galley
or
elsewhere
on
the
vessel
except
the
eighteen-inch
razor
sharp
butcher
knife
that
he
could
have
used
for
the
purpose.
he
used
this
sharp
butcher
knife
without
a
guarded
blade
when
he
could
have
used
and
said
that
he
could
have
used
a
different
type
of
knife
with
a
guarded
blade
and
now
he
seeks
to
charge
this
respondent
with
the
consequences
of
his
own
negligence.
mr.
william
a.wilson
which
one
is
that,
sir?
mr.
william
a.wilson
i
don't
have
it
offhand,
sir.
mr.
william
a.wilson
i'll
see
if
i
could
--
and
he
refers
to
--
he
referred
to
a
french
knife
which
he
described
as
a
knife
with
a
guarded
blade
which
he
had
earlier
used
in
which
he
had
seen
used.
mr.
william
a.wilson
earlier
used
and
had
seen
used.
i'm
referring
to
the
language
at
the
bottom
of
page
60
of
the
record
and
at
the
top
of
page
61.
mr.
william
a.wilson
we
contend
generally,
sir,
that
they
were
available
for
his
use
any
and
all
instruments
that
would
normally
be
expected
to
be
found
in
the
galley
of
a
passenger
vessel
equipped
to
serve
meals
to
500
passengers.
mr.
william
a.wilson
there's
no
question
that
it
was
not,
sir.(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
a.wilson
no
question
that
it
was
--
that
it
if
their
own
--
no
claim
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner
that
it
was
not
properly
equipped.
petitioner
--
mr.
william
a.wilson
with
a
bar
tool.
mr.
william
a.wilson
with
a
bar
tool,
with
a
specific
tool
--
mr.
william
a.wilson
--
that's
designed
for
purposes
or
for
use
in
a
bar
room
i
suppose
or
in
one
of
the
ship's
saloon,
not
in
the
--
the
galley.
there's
no
indication
that
such
a
tool
has
ever
been
seen
in
the
galley
on
board
a
passenger
vessel
or
elsewhere.
mr.
william
a.wilson
in
the
first
place,
that
there's
no
indication
that
it
was
a
rush
call
for
the
ice
cream
but
had
it
--
as
assuming
it
had
been,
the
respondent
would
expect
the
man
not
to
attempt
to
serve
that
ice
cream
if
they
could
not
be
served
in
a
manner
that
would
have
failed
to
endanger
the
petitioner's
health
or
condition.
failing
that,
the
respondent
would
expect
the
petitioner
to
consult
one
of
his
superiors
with
regard
to
that
condition.
mr.
william
a.wilson
no
indeed,
they
would
not,
sir.
mr.
william
a.wilson
they
would
not
in
the
first
place
be
on
notice
of
a
condition
of
hardness
of
the
ice
cream.
but
if
they
were
they
would
not
expect
and
could
not
reasonably
anticipate
that
this
petitioner
would
choose
to
use
and
implement
which
prove
to
be
dangerous
in
order
to
serve
that
ice
cream.
there's
no
indication
from
the
record
--
mr.
william
a.wilson
what
he
would
use,
sir?
mr.
william
a.wilson
he
could
well
have
used
the
scoop
that
he
had,
failing
that
which
--
which
as
i
say
in
answer
to
a
--
a
previous
question
could
well
have
been
used
in
order
to
scrape
the
ice
cream
from
the
top
where
this
ice
--
mr.
william
a.wilson
he
could
not
scoop
it
out,
sir.
mr.
william
a.wilson
there's
no
evidence
so
far
as
i
recall
from
the
record
that
the
ice
cream
could
not
have
been
scraped
with
the
tool
that
was
provided.
but
even
so,
it's
--
it's
the
respondent's
position
on
--
in
connection
with
this
petition
that
it
should
not
and
could
not
reasonably
have
anticipated
that
any
danger
would
befall
this
man
by
reason
of
the
fact
of
the
hardness
of
the
ice
cream
which
in
itself
is
in
no
sense
a
dangerous
substance.
mr.
william
a.wilson
assuming,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
respondent
should
have
foreseen
the
need
for
a
tool,
it
does
not
follow
that
he
should
have
foreseen
that
an
injury
should
happen
to
the
petitioner
by
reason
of
the
absence
of
it.
this
requires
the
foresight
upon
the
part
of
the
respondent
that
the
condition
of
the
ice
cream
would
have
reasonably
resulted
in
the
petitioner's
use,
first
of
the
dangerous
appliance
not
intended
for
its
purpose
and
second,
he
uses
that
dangerous
appliance
in
a
dangerous
manner
for
which
it
was
never
intended.
the
bread
knife
that
was
used
--
the
butcher
knife
that
was
used
was
extremely
sharp.
it
was
designed
as
a
cutting
instrument
not
as
a
jabbing
instrument.
that
is
precisely
where
this
case
departs
from
the
decision
of
this
court
in
jacob
against
the
city
of
new
york,
where
there
was
admittedly,
a
defective
wrench.
apparently,
there
was
an
end
wrench
which
had
become
so
worn
that
it
would
no
longer
take
hold
of
a
bolt
or
a
nut
or
a
bolt
of
the
size
for
which
it
was
designed
and
after
having
made
several
requests
for
a
replacement,
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
was
referred
to
the
possibility
that
he
might
have
a
monkey
wrench
perfectly
good.
no
question
about
it,
but
he
preferred
to
use
the
end
wrench.
now
there
was
the
--
the
production
by
the
shipowner
of
a
defective
appliance.
there's
no
such
indication
here.
mr.
william
a.wilson
a
special
gadget
made?
mr.
william
a.wilson
a
special
gadget
made,
i
did
not
--
mr.
william
a.wilson
there
is
none
to
the
respondent's
knowledge.
but
there
are
several
gadgets
made
for
chipping
ice
--
mr.
william
a.wilson
--
one
of
which
--
mr.
william
a.wilson
the
respondent
has
never
heard
of
any
instrument
being
used
on
ice
cream
other
than
a
standard
closed-type
spoon
for
the
type
of
appliance
with
which
the
petitioner
was
furnished.
mr.
william
a.wilson
whose
--
whose
particular
duty
on
board
the
vessel?
mr.
william
a.wilson
no,
sir,
it
does
not.
it
--
it
--
it's
silent
on
that
question.
it
was
not
--
mr.
william
a.wilson
--
in
any
event
the
petitioner's
duty.
he
was
the
second
baker
--
a
third
baker
or
a
second
baker
whose
duties
were
centered
only
about
the
galley
and
the
galley
areas.
mr.
william
a.wilson
not
--
not
to
bring
it
up
until
it
was
tempered.
sir
the
tampering
is
done
at
the
site
at
which
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
operating.
the
ice
cream
generally
was
kept
in
a
frozen
state
one
deck
below.
and
then
it
was
brought
up
and
put
into
the
tempering
chest
from
which
the
petitioner
served
it.
it
was
with
regard
to
the
condition
of
that
tempering
chest
that
some
testimony
was
offered
and
i
would
like
to
refer
to
that
now
if
i
may,
that
tempering
chest
on
the
galley
deck.
mr.
william
a.wilson
i
have
several
page
references,
if
i
may,
sir,
there
--
it
appears
to
--
mr.
william
a.wilson
specifically,
sir,
the
person
whose
duty
that
was,
that
member
of
the
crew
whose
duty
that
was,
is
not
identified
in
the
record.
it
was
some
other
member
of
the
galley
force
apparently.
i
refer
now
to
the
condition
of
the
tempering
chest
itself
as
to
which
some
question
was
raised
on
the
record
before
this
court
by
the
petitioner.
and
i
point
out
that
there
is
no
evidence
whatever
to
indicate
that
the
respondent
was
negligent
by
reason
of
any
defective
machinery
within
the
contemplation
of
the
language
of
the
federal
employers
liability
act.
mr.
william
a.wilson
the
shipowner
rested
it
towards
the
plaintiff's
case.
mr.
william
a.wilson
yes,
he
could,
sir.
mr.
william
a.wilson
that
inference
could
be
drawn,
sir.
mr.
william
a.wilson
only
to
point
out
that
although
the
petitioner
indicates
in
his
argument
that
there
was
a
defect
of
machinery,
the
defect
was
of
such
nature
that
it
would
cause
directly
contrary
effect
to
that
which
the
petitioner
suggests
was
the
case
here.
mr.
william
a.wilson
in
--
mr.
william
a.wilson
i
mentioned
--
mr.
william
a.wilson
i
mention
it
only
to
dispose
of
the
possible
question
that
the
negligence
refer
to
defective
machinery
within
the
contemplation
of
the
fela.
now,
whether
there
was
negligence
at
some
other
stage
as
--
as
to
the
time
of
bringing
it
up
not
only
as
apart
from
the
question
of
the
condition
of
the
machinery
itself
which
according
to
the
petitioner's
argument
which
two
factors
would
appear
to
counterbalance.
i
don't
say
--
mr.
william
a.wilson
no,
sir,
he
did
not.
mr.
william
a.wilson
so
far
as
the
hardness
of
the
ice
cream
is
concerned,
yes,
sir.
there
is
in
the
record
no
evidence
that
the
respondent
had
any
reason
to
forsee
the
possibility
of
any
danger
to
the
petitioner
in
the
circumstances.
mr.
william

none,
whatever,
sir.
there
is
no
--
the
record
is
completely
barren
of
any
indication
that
the
petitioner's
supervisors,
superiors
or
anyone
else
on
the
ship
had
any
reason
to
believe
that
the
ice
cream
was
other
than
in
serviceable
condition.
in
this
argument
that
the
respondent
negligently
failed
to
furnish
the
petitioner
with
a
safe
place
to
work,
the
petitioner
appears
to
take
the
position
that
the
respondent
should
reasonably
have
foreseen
the
possibility
that
he
would
use
the
instrument
that
he
did
this
razor
sharp
butcher
knife,
which
wasn't
provided
for
this
use
and
used
it
for
a
purpose
for
which
it
was
not
intended
and
in
a
manner
for
which
it
was
not
designed.
at
pages
60
and
61
of
the
record,
the
petitioner
admits
that
the
use
of
a
knife
was
improper.
reading
from
the
bottom
of

60,
question
have
you
ever
seen
a
knife
used
to
serve
ice
cream
while
employed
on
any
other
vessel,
have
you?
answer:
yes.
question:
a
knife
similar
to
the
one
that
you
used
on
this
particular
occasion?
answer:
no.
question:
what
kind
of
a
knife
was
it
that
you
saw
used?
answer:
french
knife.
question:
what
is
a
french
knife?
a
french
knife
has
a
flange
at
the
bottom
of
the
handle
where
your
hand
would
never
go
down
on
the
blade.
question:
then
would
you
say
that
the
knife
that
you
used
on
this
particular
occasion
was
improper?
answer:
that's
right.
what
was
the
purpose
of
this
knife?
they
used
it
to
cut
french
bread.
question:
it
wasn't
put
there
to
serve
ice
cream,
was
it?
the
element
of
foreseeability
is
essential
to
the
proof
of
a
negligence
case
under
this.
mr.
william
a.wilson
i
know
of
none,
sir.
mr.
william
a.wilson
this
is
the
first
case
of
its
kind
where
a
claimant
under
either
the
jones
act
or
the
fela
has
claimed
that
there
was
negligence
by
reason
of
a
hard
ice
cream
after
he
had
used
a
sharp
knife
in
order
to
help
him
as
he
says,
“serve
it”.
i
assume
that
the
importance
of
this
case
is
restricted
to
its
particular
facts,
the
point
to
which
i
should
like
to
come
later.
this
court
has
recognized
the
necessity
of
this
element
of
foreseeability
on
several
occasions
in
jamison
against
encarnacion
and
more
recently
in
the
case
of
jacob
against
the
city
of
new
york,
both
of
which
are
cited
at
page
9
of
the
respondent's
brief.
but
particularly,
this
court
has
recognized
that
element
of
foreseeability
as
a
necessity
in
the
railroad
cases
in
brady
against
the
southern
railway
which
is
cited
at
page
15
of
the
respondent's
brief.
that
case
involved
an
action
that
was
brought
in
a
state
court
in
north
carolina
for
death
of
a
brakeman
employed
on
the
defendant
railway
--
by
the
defendant
railway
company.
i
will
omit
a
reading
of
the
facts
in
order
to
shorten
the
time
and
to
refer
the
court
to
the
specific
language
that
was
used
by
this
court
in
connection
with
its
decision.
regarding
the
specific
question
of
reasonableness
of
anticipation,
this
court
said,
“the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
was
of
the
view
that
striking
a
derailer
from
the
unexpected
direction
'was
so
unusual,
so
contrary
to
the
purpose'
of
the
derailer
that
provision
to
guard
against
such
a
happening
was
beyond
the
requirement
of
due
care.
with
this
we
agree.
bare
possibility
is
not
sufficient.
quoting
then
from
milwaukee
against
st.
paul
railway
and
st.
paul
railway
against
kellogg
in
94
u.s.,
this
court
said,
"it
is
generally
held,
that,
in
order
to
warrant
the
finding
that
negligence,
or
an
act
not
amounting
to
wanton
wrong,
is
the
proximate
cause
of
an
injury
it
must
appear
that
the
injury
was
the
natural
and
probable
consequence
of
the
negligence
or
wrongful
act,
and
that
it
ought
to
have
been
foreseen
in
the
light
of
the
attending
circumstances."
events
too
remote
to
require
reasonable
prevision
need
not
be
anticipated.
it
would
be
unreasonable
in
this
case
the
respondent
submits
for
it
to
forsee
--
mr.
william
a.wilson
sir?
mr.
william
a.wilson
i
refer
to
brady
against
the
southern
railway
company
in
320
u.s.
476,
320
u.s.
476.
in
its
opinion,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
here
had
this
to
say,
“after
reciting
the
facts,
the
court
said,
“no
one
in
authority
told
plaintiff
to
use
the
butcher
knife
which
was
customarily
used
in
cutting
french
bread.
the
knife
was
properly
in
the
galley
and
there
was
nothing
defective
about
it
but
it
was
never
designed
for
or
intended
to
be
used
as
a
dagger
or
ice
pick
for
chipping
frozen
ice
cream.
and
that
it
would
be
put
to
such
use
was
not
within
the
realm
of
reasonable
foreseeability.
the
court
of
appeals
referred
to
one
of
its
earlier
decisions
in
manhat
against
the
united
states
for
which
there
is
a
short
discussion
at
page
9
of
the
respondent's
brief.
mr.
william
a.wilson
it's
quite
possible
that
there
is
room
for
the
inference
from
the
record
that
the
respondent
could
anticipate
that
the
petitioner
would
do
something.
mr.
william
a.wilson
no,
sir.
i
quite
agree.
mr.
william
a.wilson
i
don't
believe
it
does,
sir,
because
i
think
we
stopped
short
of
that
point.
our
position
being
that
in
order
to
establish
a
case
in
negligence
under
the
jones
act,
it's
necessary
that
there'd
be
an
indication
of
reasonable
foreseeability
on
the
part
of
the
respondent.
mr.
william
a.wilson
that
the
--
not
only
that
but
that
the
petitioner
would
use
something
dangerous
and
use
it
in
a
dangerous
fashion.
in
other
words,
this
adds
up
to
the
question
of
the
ability
of
the
respondent
to
foresee
a
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner
and
that's
the
respondent's
position
on
that
question.
mr.
william
a.wilson
at
this
--
mr.
william
a.wilson
in
the
first
place,
we
don't
agree
that
the
respondent
had
any
notice
as
to
the
condition
of
the
commodity
but
assuming
that
we
did
i
--
i
assume
that
your
--
your
honor's
question
--
mr.
william
a.wilson
i
believe
that's
true.
mr.
william
a.wilson
i
believe
that's
true,
sir.
but
to
do
that,
to
--
to
reach
the
ultimate
result
that
was
reached
here
would
require
a
--
apparently
a
chain
of
inferences.
first,
as
to
the
negligence
of
someone,
some
agent
of
the
shipowner
with
regard
to
the
condition
of
the
ice
cream,
then
the
inference
that
faced
with
that
condition,
the
petitioner
would
not
stop
doing
what
he's
doing
but
take
some
other
kind
of
implement
in
order
to
serve
the
ice
cream.
then
the
inference
added
to
that,
that
the
instrument
which
the
petitioner
did
or
would
reasonably
take
would
be
an
instrument
of
such
character
as
possibly
to
cause
him
danger
and
finally
the
inference
that
having
satisfied
all
these
inferences,
the
instrument
would
be
improperly
used
by
the
petitioner
and
would
result
in
injury
to
him.
mr.
william
a.wilson
if
the
court
please,
there
is
here
involved
no
question
either
of
contributory
negligence
or
of
risk
assumption.
it's
the
position
of
the
respondent
here
that
there
is
no
negligence
on
its
part
consequently
neither
of
those
theories
or
defenses
as
any
cause
for
appearing
in
the
page.
may
i
refer
briefly
to
the
manhat
case
which
mr.
engelman
referred
to
in
his
principal
argument.
that
was
the
case
where
the
plaintiff
was
precipitated
in
the
dark
by
the
failure
over
the
falling
of
one
of
the
lashings
securing
a
lifeboat
that
was
hung
out
over
the
side
of
the
respondent's
vessel.
particularly
with
regard
to
the
issue
of
foreseeability,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
that
case
said,
"the
prospect
of
the
falling
of
the
lifeboat
under
the
circumstances
presented
here
did
not
possess
those
elements
of
reasonable
foreseeability
which
would
impel
the
conclusion
that
reliance
upon
the
rottmer-type
releasing
gear
constituted
a
failure
to
exercise
that
degree
of
care
which
could
be
expected
of
a
reasonable
manner.
under
no
theory
said
the
second
circuit,
could
a
standard
be
considered
reasonable
which
imposed
upon
the
shipowner,
a
duty
to
safeguard
absolutely
against
the
possibility
that
the
handle
would
be
moved
by
one
of
these
men.
what
it
all
boiled
down
to
is
the
difference
between
the
exercise
of
reasonable
care
on
the
one
hand
as
contrasted
with
the
taking
of
every
conceivable
precaution
or
adherence
to
the
highest
standard
of
care
on
the
other.
now,
possibly
the
exercise
by
the
respondent
here
what
every
conceivable
precaution
or
adherence
by
it
to
the
highest
standard
of
care
may
have
avoided
this
accident
but
quite
clearly,
such
conduct
on
the
respondent's
part
was
not
required.
the
record
is
bare
of
any
evidence
to
indicate
violation
by
the
respondent
of
any
reasonable
duty
that
it
was
imposed
on
it
under
the
jones
act
to
anticipate
the
possibility
of
harm
to
the
petitioner
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
william
a.wilson
it
was
a
--
it
was
a
knife
of
a
thin
blade,
sir.
i'm
not
aware
that
the
blade
itself
was
a
flexible
material.
there's
is
no
indication
of
any
bending
of
it
in
the
record.
mr.
william
a.wilson
no,
sir.
i
don't
believe
this
was.
i
believe
that
there
was
substantial
thickness
to
the
blade
of
the
knife
in
this
case.
before
closing,
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
the
respondent
here
concedes
that
the
simple
tool
doctrine
has
no
relevance
to
this
case.
at
point
2
of
its
brief,
the
petitioner
refused
to
argue
that
the
court
of
appeals
failed
to
take
notice
of
the
facts
that
the
knife
which
caused
the
injury
in
this
case
and
this
ice
chipper
which
the
petitioner
says
should
have
been
given
to
him
were
both
simple
tools.
having
negligently
failed
to
provide
the
necessary
simple
tool
the
petitioner
said,
“the
respondent
should
justly
be
charged
with
any
harm
that
may
flow
from
his
conduct
whether
foreseeable
or
not.”
mr.
william
a.wilson
no,
sir,
the
knife
was
never
found.
the
knife
was
not
recovered
on
board
the
vessel.
it
was
described
and
it
is
described
in
the
record
though
i
don't
have
the
specific
page
reference.
mr.
william
a.wilson
i
doubt
it
very
much,
sir.
all
we
know
is
that
it
was
a
knife
of
about
eighteen
inches
in
length
with
a
handle
of
about
four
and
a
half
inches
and
an
unguarded
blade.
i
refer
to
the
characteristic
of
the
unguarded
blade
because
the
petitioner
in
his
testimony
to
which
i
refer
the
court
contrasts
this
knife
with
a
french
knife
which
does
have
a
guarded
blade.
the
petitioner
argues
that
the
simple
tool
doctrine
has
no
application
on
the
jones
act
case
and
with
this,
the
respondent
certainly
agrees
because
the
simple
tool
doctrine
is
concerned
with
the
issue
of
liability
of
a
master
with
regard
to
his
servant
in
a
situation
where
the
master
provides
the
servant
with
the
defective
appliance
of
such
a
simple
character
that
the
defect
is
or
should
be
apparent
to
the
servant
and
by
virtue
of
that
fact
the
master
is
exonerated
from
liability
caused
by
that
obvious
defect
because
of
the
principle
of
the
assumption
of
the
risk.
now,
respondent
readily
agrees
that
that
can
have
no
place
in
the
jones
act
case
because
there's
no
room
for
assumption
of
the
risk
in
the
jones
act
case.
so,
any
reference
by
the
petitioner
here
to
applicability
of
the
simple
tool
doctrine
appears
to
be
out
of
order
particularly
because
such
a
doctrine
was
never
proposed
by
the
respondent
at
any
point
of
the
defense
and
was
not
referred
to
in
any
sense
by
the
court
of
appeals.
we
take
it
that
the
--
the
doctrine
has
been
brought
to
the
forefront
of
the
argument
here
by
the
petitioner
with
the
view
to
bringing
this
case
somewhat
in
parallel
with
jacob
against
the
city
of
new
york
which
is
referred
to
at
page
9
of
the
respondent's
brief.
but,
of
course,
the
facts
in
that
case
and
the
facts
in
this
are
substantially
different.
there,
a
situation
was
presented
where
actually
a
defective
appliance
was
provided
by
the
master.
here
--
there
--
the
record
is
barren
of
any
defective
appliance
whatsoever.
if
all
--
only
defect
appears
to
be
the
conduct
of
the
petitioner
in
doing
what
he
did.
the
respondent
respectfully
submits
that
the
petitioner
failed
to
establish
on
the
trial
a
prima
facie
case
of
negligence
against
the
respondent,
had
to
justify
denial
by
the
trial
court
of
the
respondent's
motion
for
a
directed
verdict.
the
petitioner
failed
to
prove
that
there
was
any
duty
owing
to
him
by
the
respondent
that
was
not
fully
performed.
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
ruling
that
the
respondent
motion
for
a
directed
verdict
should
have
been
granted
and
in
reversing
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
on
that
ground.
mr.
william
a.wilson
it
--
mr.
william
a.wilson
in
--
mr.
william
a.wilson
i
doubt
it
very
much.
this
baker
has
testified
that
one
of
his
principle
duties
was
to
serve
ice
cream.
i
think
it's
just
a
question
of
the
allocation
of
jobs
among
the
people
in
the
bakery
department
on
board
the
vessel
and
that
question
of
course
--
that
issue
which
your
honor
refers
has
never
been
raised.
the
court
of
appeals
in
reversing
the
judgment
of
the
district
courts
has
the
full
authority
--
has
the
full
support
of
the
case
authorities
that
require
in
a
jones
act
case
as
in
every
common
law
negligence
case
that
sound
probative
evidence
must
be
produced
before
a
case
may
be
submitted
to
the
jury
for
their
consideration.
i
refer
particularly
to
gunning
against
cooley,
cited
at
page
14
of
the
respondent's
brief
and
the
brady
against
the
southern
railway
company
to
which
i
refer
thereof.
insofar
as
the
respondent
can
see,
this
petition
appears
to
present
no
question
other
than
a
revisitation
by
this
court
of
the
nature
and
scope
of
the
evidence
produced
by
the
petitioner
on
the
trial.
they
refused
to
be
here
and
no
question
whose
importance
extends
beyond
the
interest
to
the
parties
to
this
litigation
before
it
reaches
beyond
these
particular
facts.
although
the
petition
speaks
of
a
new
rule
of
law
that's
established
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
which
is
said
to
the
contrary
to
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
of
other
courts
of
appeals,
a
review
on
the
record
and
reading
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
shows
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
fully
consistent
with
the
body
of
case
law
that
now
serves
to
interpret
the
jones
act.
it
presents
to
this
court
no
case
of
first
impression.
for
these
reasons
the
respondent
prays
that
the
writ
of
certiorari
be
dismissed
or
in
any
event,
if
the
matter
is
to
be
considered
on
the
merits
of
the
petition
that
the
record
fully
justifies
affirmance
of
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
