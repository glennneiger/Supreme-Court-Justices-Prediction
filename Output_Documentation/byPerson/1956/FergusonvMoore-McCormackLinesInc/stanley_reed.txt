justice
stanley

is
--
is
there
a
testimony
in
regard
to
the
character
of
other
implements
that
were
there
by
which
the
ice
cream
haven't
been
gotten
out?
justice
stanley
reed
the
negligence,
would
it
be
necessary
to
furnish
an
ice
pick,
is
that
the
only
implement
that
would've
satisfied
due
care
here?
justice
stanley
reed
ice
picks
wouldn't
do?
justice
stanley
reed
don't
they
have
any
ice
on
the
board?
justice
stanley
reed
was
this
with
the
fela
case?
justice
stanley

wasn't
it
an
inadequately
equipped
ship?
justice

in
the
earlier
case.
justice

unseaworthiness?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
is
this
a
foreseeability
case
or
is
this
a
case
of
negligence
for
freezing
the
ice
cream
too
hard?
justice
stanley
reed
well
then,
do
all
the
circumstances
have
to
be
foreseeable
as
to
freeze
the
ice
cream
too
hard,
like
the
sharp
knife
where
the
steward
would
--
would
pick
up
a
sharp
knife?
justice
stanley
reed
you
don't
think
it
was
negligence
to
have
a
hard
ice
cream?
justice
stanley
reed
but
if
they
hadn't
conditioned
it,
the
negligence
was
not
conditioning
it
before
they
went
to
serve
it.
justice
stanley
reed
before
you
take
that
case
up,
what
--
what
do
you
think
is
the
negligence
that's
--
that's
charged
against
your
client?
justice
stanley
reed
the
record
reference
to
that
statement
is,
in
the
record,
that
you
just
spoke
of?
justice
stanley
reed
in
regard
to
being
available
the
other
knife
to
him
--
that
is
passed
on
to
him?
justice
stanley
reed
(voice

--
justice
stanley
reed
that
--
that
is
what
i
--
i
asked
you,
whose
duty
it
was
to
--
perhaps
i
don't
understand
you.
who
--
whose
duty
was
it
to
see
that
the
ice
cream
was
in
readiness
to
serve?
