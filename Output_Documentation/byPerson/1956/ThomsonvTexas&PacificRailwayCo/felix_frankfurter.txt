you
mean
--
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
counsel
do
not
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
fifth
circuit
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
this
class
of
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
--
can
you
say,
as
your
experience
is
trivial,
fifth
circuit
cases
enable
one
to
say
that
there
is
a
current
--
that
there's
an
attitude
has
occurred
adjudication
by
that
court
in
this
regard
of
the
decisions
of
this
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i
asked
you
a
very
specific
question
and
i
don't
mean
that
this
--
you
know
my
attitude
toward
these
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
--
but
you
latterly
raised
a
question
in
which
i
am
deeply
interested
to
--
just
the
relevance
in
my
point
of
view.
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that
--
i'm
not
talking
about
your
case
but
having
been
in
this
case
and
therefore
presumably
in
other
cases
and
therefore
presumably
having
studied
what
is
called
in
louisiana
the
jurisprudence
of
the
fifth
circuit.
can
one
find
in
that
jurisprudence,
namely,
in
a
current
of
cases
before
that
court?
now,
that's
all
bringing
into
question
any
motive
that
they
disregard
--
that
they
disregard,
they
consciously
do
not
take
into
account
the
decisions
of
this
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
to
say
you
feel
so
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
suppose
if
--
if
i
made
it
my
job
to
look
at
all
the
reported
cases
in
the
fifth
circuit,
i
would
find
that
they
don't
care
what
this
court
has
decided.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
just
want
to
know
what
your
impression
is
because
that
line
should
be
--
very
well,
if
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
to
say
--
i
don't
mean
to
say
you
--
you
shouldn't
prevail
apart
from
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
you
did
say
something
like
that,
didn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
initiate
this
remark.
you
initiated
it,
didn't
you.
