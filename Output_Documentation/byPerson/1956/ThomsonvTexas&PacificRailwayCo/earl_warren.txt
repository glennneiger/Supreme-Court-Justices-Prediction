chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
that
last
that
he
said?
i
--
i
didn't
quite
get
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
get
your
last
statement
that
was
made.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
before
that,
what
had
been
told
to
her
in
that
regard
by
a
higher
superior,
did
you
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
look.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
heavy
do
these
bags
get?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
they
get
heavier
than
that
on
--
on
occasions?
chief
justice
earl
warren
had
she
been
told
before
that
she
must
do
this
herself
but
must
not
--
must
not
get
any
other
help?
chief
justice
earl
warren
she
--
she
must
not
use
this
mexican?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
that
it
wasn't
as
counsel
stated
that
this
--
it
was?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
was
her
purpose
of
talking
to
them
if
she
wasn't
complaining
it
was
too
heavy
for
her?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
no
--
is
there
no
limit
in
this
--
in
that
particular
state
as
to
the
weight
that
women
--
weight
of
packages
women
are
permitted
to
handle
in
their
employment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
states
do.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
is
pretty
--
pretty
heavy
weight
to
have
women
in
there,
throwing
around
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
couldn't
she
get
--
why
wouldn't
they
permit
her
to
use
the
mexican
laborer
if
he
was
available?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
understood
counsel
to
say
that
when
--
when
she
took
it
up
with
her
superior,
her
superior
told
her
that,
"now,
you've
got
a
man's
job
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you've
got
to
do
it
yourself.
you've
got
to
do
it
and
do
it
without
other
help.”

(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
it
191?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
--
now,
is
that
--
that's
referring
to
this
particular
night?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no,
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
--
what
you
just
read.
no,
mr.
higginbotham
told
me,
this
is
just
oral,
but
this
is
what
he
said,
the
best
i
can
remember,
i
was
to
take
this
one
car,
this
one
truck.
now,
is
she
referring
to
that
particular
night?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
all
of
your
women
operator-agents
or
what
did
they
call
him
here,
agent-operators
on
this
railroad
wear
men's
clothing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
this
woman
was
told
according
to
thomson's
argument
that
--
that
she
must
wear
--
wear
it
because
she
had
a
man's
job
to
do
and
--
and
she
had
to
wear
men's
clothing
if
that
was
necessary
to
do
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
my
--
my
question
is,
is
that
--
is
that
the
normal
instruction
you
give
to
your
women
agent-operators
and
are
they
suppose,
all
of
them,
to
wear
men's
clothing
when
they
--
if
they
handle
any
mail?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
you
--
as
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
--
you
say
this
is
an
unusually
heavy
load
this
--
in
this
particular
day.
how
would
the
woman
know
--
know
when
she's
taking
care
of
the
mail
whether
there
was
going
to
be
very
light
load
or
whether
there's
going
to
be
a
very
heavy
one
like
--
like
this.
and
i
would
think
that
it
would
have
some
significance
as
to
how
she
dressed,
if
she
dressed
normally
in
women's
clothes.
and
occasionally,
she
got
a
--
a
truck
like
this,
it
would
be
a
dangerous
thing
for
her,
wouldn't
it,
to
handle
--
handle
mail
bags
that
--
that
are
up
to
75
pounds
and
--
and
running
around
this
trucks
in
a
woman's
clothing,
skirts
that
might
get
tangled
up
on
--
on
things
that
trip
her
and
injure
her?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
i
suppose
if
it
was
--
it
was
packed
higher
with
mail,
she
might
have
to
get
on
top
of
the
mail.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
haven't
you?
you've
seen
that
in
the
railroad,
you
are
doing
this,
haven't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
she
didn't
complain
of
--
of
the
bad
kidneys.
she's
claiming
of
an
injured
back
after
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
handling
this
mail.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
she
had
been
told
sometime
before,
i
say
if
she
had
been
told
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
sometime
before
that
she
had
to
do
this
work
herself
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
that
she
was
not
to
get
anybody
else
to
do
it.
wouldn't
that
bear
on
the
question
as
to
whether
on
that
morning
she
should
have
asked
for
--
for
some
more
help?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
did
she
--
where
did
she
testify
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
all
you
referred
to
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
all
you
referred
to
on
this
statement
that
you
just
made
to
us?
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
she
said
she
has
never
on
any
occasion
done
any
such
thing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know
but
that's
not
what
you
said,
sir.
you
said
that
she
testified
that
she
had
not
on
any
other
occasion
ever
--
ever
asked
anybody
about
this.
now,
there's
a
lot
of
difference
between
testifying
that
way
and
not
testifying
at
all
on
the
subject.
chief
justice
earl
warren
go
on
to
say
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
do
you
--
how
do
you
explain
this
--
this
answer
on
the
bottom
of
page
18
that
justice
douglas
called
your
attention?
and
that
it
seems
to
me
she's
talking
about
more
than
that
there.
taking
it
in
context
to
--
it
seems
to
me
that
she
is
complaining
that
--
that
she
needs
help
and
he
says,
"no,
you're
doing
a
man's
job
and
you
do
it
by
yourself.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
ms.
tarpley,
did
you
--
have
something
in
rebuttal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
a
pretty
rough
question
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
that's
--
i
think
that's
a
pretty
rough
to
question
to
ask
