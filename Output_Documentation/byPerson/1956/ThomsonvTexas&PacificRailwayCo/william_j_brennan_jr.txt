justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
there
was
some
evidence,
was
there
not,
that
this
was
in
the
christmas
season?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
mean
wasn't
the
--
wasn't
the
suggestion
that
the
volume
of
mail
was
a
little
larger
or
perhaps
much
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
suppose
the
railroad
was
charged
with
that
knowledge
with
--
equally
with
the
petitioner.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
the
railroad
simply
doesn't
deny
that
it
would
have
knowledge
to
the
christmas
season
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
volume
of
the
mail
was
larger.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
don't
you
think
that's
a
fact
too
which
bears
upon
whether
or
not
there
should
have
been
some
affirmative
aid
offered
her
by
the
railroad?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
wasn't
--
wasn't
there
also
a
fact
question
whether
she
testified
and
she'd
been
instructed
that
she
was
not
to
ask
if
she
couldn't
have
anyone
to
help
her
with
it?
there
wasn't
any
need
to
ask
because
she
couldn't
get
any
help?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
--
why
not?
she
testified
with
that
effect
too.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
is
slick
sligh
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
she
was
asked
--
especially
whether
she
asked
them
for
assistance
and
she
said
she
didn't
because
she
had
been
told
by
her
superior
not
to
ask
for
any
help
and
that
that
maybe
she
wasn't
telling
the
truth
but
was
is
not
for
the
jury
to
decide?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
ordinarily,
i
--
issues
of
credibility
for
the
jury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
apparently,
the
trial
judge
thought
there
was
enough
to
let
the
jury
decide
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
fact,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it's
a
test
whether
a
judge,
you
or
i
or
anyone
else
can
read
it
but
whether
reasonably
the
jury
can
read
it
that
way,
that
test?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
is
the
test,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
--
where
the
problem
basically
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
here
is
whether
there
was
a
jury
question
or
wasn't.
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
if
that
can
be
read
as
the
chief
justice
suggests,
doesn't
that
answer
that
there
was
a
jury
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
--
i
don't
think
it's
a
matter
of
taking
it
out
of
context.
it's
a
question
the
jury,
after
all,
the
jury
see
the
witnesses.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
certainly
we
didn't,
neither
did
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
trial
judge
saw
the
witness
--
witnesses
and
the
trial
judge
felt
that
on
what
the
jury
saw
and
what
the
jury
heard,
the
jury
could
decide
whether
to
(inaudible)
and
that's
why
he
sent
it
to
the
jury,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
not
ordinarily
the
way
we
do
these
things
in
negligence
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
i
didn't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
didn't
think
that
the
determination
was
based
upon
what
we
might
do
taking
a
printed
record
and
say
the
thing
mattered,
it
was
rather
what
the
trial
judge
ordinarily
might
properly
feel
that
the
jury
could
draw
upon
it,
that
they
could
draw
the
inference
which
the
chief
justice's
question
suggests.
that's
a
jury
question
for
the
jury
to
decide,
isn't
it?
