mr.
j.
b.
look
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
now,
here's
why
we
are
up
here.
the
petitioner
pled
in
her
pleading
that
that
morning
she
noticed
there
was
an
unusual
heavy
amount
of
mail
and
then
she
told
her
superior
about
it
but
he
ordered
her
to
go
ahead.
the
proof
did
not
show
that.
there's
absolutely
no
evidence
as
to
that.
now,
here's
what
happens
on
these
jobs.
she
had
been
working
for
some
15
months
as
an
agent-operator.
she
testified
it
was
normally
one
of
the
regular
duties
of
an
agent-operator
to
handle
the
mail,
that
she
knew
it
was
the
duty
of
the
agent-operator
at
monahans,
where
she
asked
the
railroad
to
send
her
to
handle
the
mail.
now
then,
what
happens
is
this,
the
post
office
employees
sacked
the
mail,
not
the
railroad.
they
determine
how
much
it
will
be
in
a
sack
and
how
many
sacks
there
will
be
and
they
load
them
on
to
these
carts.
and
then
a
railroad
employee
takes
the
cart
and
takes
the
mail
off
of
the
truck,
which
is
an
ordinary
kind
of
cart
that
the
railway
express
and
railroads
all
use,
and
sets
them
inside
the
--
the
railway
post
office
car
and
takes
the
rest
of
them
all.
of
course,
the
railroad
post
office
car,
their
employees
in
there
are
united
states
employees,
united
states
government
employees
and
not
railroad
employees.
mr.
j.
b.
look
on
this
occasion,
she
stated
the
bags
were
--
some
of
them
50
to
75
pounds
on
this
particular
occasion.
now,
remember
--
mr.
j.
b.
look
i
--
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
the
record
is
completely
silent
as
to
that.
i
--
i
don't
know
how
heavy
they
might
get.
i
took
it
that
this
was
"unusually
heavy
this
morning"
is
the
impression
that
you
get
from
reading
the
record
on
only,
that
this
particular
morning
she
said
the
sacks
were
heavy.
but
now,
all
of
this
happens
while
the
train
stops
there.it
stopped
there
in
the
station
at
monahans.
there
was
no
way
in
the
world
that
the
railroad
could
have
known,
the
t
&
p
railroad
could
have
possibly
known
how
many
sacks
and
what
weight
the
sacks
would
be
that
the
railway
post
office
company
--
the
united
states
post
office
company
employees
would
sack
on
that
train.
now
then
--
mr.
j.
b.
look
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
look
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
look
no,
sir.
she
stated
that
she
couldn't
wear
skirts
and
hose,
he
--
the
superior
and
still
do
that
job.
now,
her
superior
that
she
is
talking
about,
that
first
told
her
about
skirts
and
hose,
worked
on
another
division
of
the
railway
and
he
had
told
her
that
so
long
as
your
duties
are
performed
--
you
can
perform
your
duties
satisfactorily,
we
want
you
to
wear
skirts
and
hose.
but
one
of
her
duties
was
handling
the
mail,
which
is
the
normal
everyday
duty
of
agent-operators
throughout
the
--
the
country.
now
then,
when
she
got
to
monahans,
someday
beforehand,
she
said
this
when
she
was
reminded
that
she
was
not
performing
that
function.
she
--
she
said,
"i
can't
wear
skirts
and
hose
and
do
that."
he
says,
"all
right,
then
don't
wear
skirts
and
hose
but
your
job
is
to
handle
the
mail."
she
never
did
tell
anyone
that
the
job
was
too
strenuous
for
her,
either
on
that
morning
or
any
other
occasion,
she
never
complained
to
anyone.
now
then,
we
get
to
the
--
to
the
tiller
case.
mr.
j.
b.
look
she
said
she
would
have
to
climb
up
and
down
on
those
carts
and
she
couldn't
dress
in
skirts
and
hose
and
go
--
she'd
be
exposed
that
way,
you
see,
out
around
the
station.
that
was
her
only
complaint
that
i
can't
--
now
the
--
also
in
the
other
division,
a
woman
wear
skirts
and
hose,
"i
can't
wear
skirts
and
hose
and
climb
up
on
and
around
those
carts.”
and
he
said,
“well,
don't
wear
skirts
and
hose."
mr.
j.
b.
look
yes,
sir,
to
wear
slacks
or
some
other
appropriate
tights.
now
then,
of
course,
in
order
for
the
man
to
be
--
mr.
j.
b.
look
not
that
i
know
of,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
b.
look
i'm
in
the
personal
injury
--
mr.
j.
b.
look
one
or
two
sacks,
i
think.
the
testimony
will
show
it
weighed
that
much.
but
she
testified
she
had
never
at
any
time
ever
had
any
other
trouble.
she's
been
doing
this
now
for
15
months,
handling
mail,
not
off
just
to
this
train
but
trains
up
and
down
the
line.
she's
been
working
that
long.
now
then,
in
order
for
there
to
be
--
mr.
j.
b.
look
there
is
no
evidence
that
anyone
told
her
she
could
not
get
help.
there
was
no
evidence
as
to
that.
the
evidence
was
she
was
to
assist
in
the
handling
of
the
mail.
now,
it
depends
on
how
many
railroad
carts
there
are.
one
person
works
at
the
door,
that
is
all.
she
was
to
--
to
assist.
she
hadn't
been
doing
it.
mr.
j.
b.
look
yes.
mr.
j.
b.
look
i
don't
--
the
record,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
will
reflect
that
he
told
her
that
he
--
she
could
not
have
help.
mr.
j.
b.
look
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
look
well,
sir,
that
--
i
don't
--
mr.
j.
b.
look
of
the
record.
mr.
j.
b.
look
191,
footnote
5.
mr.
j.
b.
look
well,
when
pressed
further
she
stated,
mr.
higginbotham,
when
asked
about
that
--
mr.
higginbotham
in
that
same
note,
"told
me,
now,
this
is
just
oral
but
this
is
what
he
said,
the
best
i
can
remember,
i
was
to
take
this
one
car,
this
one
truck
and
take
it
out
and
take
what
is
on
there
and
put
it
on
the
train
and
take
this
on
the
train
and
bring
it
and
put
it
in
the
baggage
room."
she
never
did
ask
for
help.
now,
our
proposition
--
mr.
j.
b.
look
at
no
time,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
look
no,
sir.
that
was
her
regular
duty
to
do
everyday.
mr.
j.
b.
look
there
was
no
conversation
between
her
superior
and
--
and
the
petitioner
on
this
day
at
all.
there
wasn't
any
--
there
was
no
conversation
whatsoever.
there
was
evidence
that
this
was
a
normal
regular
duty
of
all
agent-operators
and
that
she
had
been
performing.
now,
our
position
is
this
that
a
request
for
help
or
assistance
is
essential
in
a
case
such
as
this
to
establish
liability
for
this
very
reason,
your
negligence
of
course
depends
upon
the
existence
of
a
duty.
the
existence
of
a
duty
arises
by
virtue
of
a
reasonable
anticipation
that
some
injury
will
befall
someone.
now
then,
thousands
upon
thousands
of
people,
men
and
women
have
--
did
this
--
performed
the
same
task
many,
many
times
and
are
performing
it
many,
many
times
even
today,
namely,
transferring
the
mail.
it
is
not
an
inherently
dangerous
task.
mr.
j.
b.
look
the
agent
--
if
they
have
a
train
--
a
passenger
train
that
carries
mail,
they've
got
to
work
the
train.
now,
whether
or
not
they
wear
men's
clothing
or
not,
i
don't
know.
mr.
j.
b.
look
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
look
they
are
not
instructed
to
wear
men's
clothing.
they
are
told
if
they
cannot
wear
women's
clothing
and
work
the
mail,
then
they
wear
men's
clothing.
now,
that
will
vary
from
station
to
station,
i
mean
they
don't
tell
them
what
--
what
they
can
wear
and
what
they
cannot
wear.
mr.
j.
b.
look
but
they
--
mr.
j.
b.
look
the
--
the
testimony
--
the
objection
to
the
wearing
of
the
women's
clothes
was
that
she
would
have
to
climb
up
on
these
carts,
on
the
record
page
36a,
one
of
these
regular
little
carts.
she
had
to
climb
up
on
to
the
cart
and
it
--
mr.
j.
b.
look
i
--
i
suppose
that
she
might.
mr.
j.
b.
look
that
is
true
in
your
larger
--
mr.
j.
b.
look
--
stations.
this
was
a
very
small
town
station
with
a
very
small
number
of
people.
for
instance,
in
--
in
--
say
in
dallas,
they
have
people
that
do
nothing
but
panel
mail
off
a
train,
say
your
agent
there
of
course
is
a
very
high
official
and
you're
operator
there,
they'll
have
many
of
them
on
duty.
but
in
this
little
stations
like
monahans,
where
they
--
and
merkel
and
all
of
the
other
little
towns
up
and
down
the
t
&
p
and
up
and
down
the
santa
fe
and
every
other
railroad
that
it's
normally
just
a
part
of
her
duties.
it
was
all
of
the
operators
perform
this
duty.
no
one
had
ever
asked
for
additional
help
or
said
that
it
wasn't
--
that
they
couldn't
do
it.
now
then,
if
you
have
a
duty
that's
just
a
normal
duty,
that
is
a
duty
that's
imposed
by
the
nature
of
the
occupation
which
we
have
here.
if
for
some
reason
this
employee
can't
do
it,
the
employee
must
in
order
to
establish
negligence,
in
order
to
establish
a
duty.
in
other
words,
a
reasonable
anticipation
of
injury,
the
employee
must
apprise
the
employer
of
the
fact.
now,
we
have
this
in
here.
the
petitioner
had
been
undergoing
treatment
for
a
kidney
ailment.
she
--
the
respondent
knew
nothing
about
it.
she
went
to
a
private
physician.
she
told
--
didn't
tell
her
boss.
she
didn't
tell
anyone
else.
now,
that
may
have
weakened
her
on
this
particular
day.
mr.
j.
b.
look
it
may
have
weakened
her
and
caused
the
injury
or
what
happened,
we
don't
know,
except
that
she
and
other
employees
did
it
constantly.
the
only
thing
different
is
she
was
ill
on
that
day
and
had
been
treated
by
a
doctor.
now,
we
didn't
know
about
it.
there
was
no
way
that
we
can
tell
(inaudible)
orders,
the
employee
goes
to
see
a
doctor
and
maybe
suffering
some
illness.
can
it
possibly
be
said
that
merely
requiring
someone
expecting
him
to
do
their
normal
job
would
be
negligence
if
by
virtue
of
the
illness
it
makes
it
dangerous
if
we
don't
know
about
the
illness?
mr.
j.
b.
look
yes,
sir.
now
--
mr.
j.
b.
look
yes,
sir.
now,
i'm
just
saying
that
the
kidney
ailment
may
have
weakened
her
to
some
extent
trying
to
account
for
this
--
this
accident.
now,
her
actions
are
relevant.
the
tiller
case
notwithstanding,
not
to
determine
whether
she
was
guilty
of
contributory
negligence
or
not
but
to
determine
whether
or
not
we
were
apprised
of
any
facts
from
which
we
could
reasonably
be
expected
to
anticipate
an
injury,
thus,
giving
us
a
duty
to
perform.
mr.
j.
b.
look
this
was
--
happened
on
the
2nd
day
of
december,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
b.
look
there
was
some
evidence
that
it
was
starting
to
get
larger,
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
look
she
was
the
only
one
with
the
railroad
that
ever
touched
the
mail
on
that.
mr.
j.
b.
look
no,
no,
no.
mr.
j.
b.
look
no.
mr.
j.
b.
look
no,
sir,
because
we
might
know
that
the
mail
is
picking
up,
but
she
has
got
a
duty
to
perform
as
she
sees
fit.
and
at
such
time
as
the
mail
becomes
heavy,
if
she
then
request
assistance
and
we
refuse
to
give
it
to
her,
we
thereby
at
all
notice.
in
other
words,
if
the
testimony
had
shown
what
she
pled,
which
it
didn't.
she,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
testified
she
didn't
even
talk
to
her
boss
that
morning.
mr.
j.
b.
look
yes.
mr.
j.
b.
look
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
look
sir
--
yes,
sir,
if
--
mr.
j.
b.
look
but
if
the
record
would
bear
that
out.
actually,
what
they
are
referring
to
there
is
the
only
conversation
she
had
with
him.
the
subject
matter
of
strenuousness
of
volume
didn't
come
up.
the
only
question
was,
she
said,
"mr.
higginbotham,
i
can't
crawl
up
on
that
cart
wearing
skirts
and
hose."
mr.
j.
b.
look
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
look
she
made
that
statement
on
further
examination
to
ask
her
what
she
was
referring
to
by
that.
she
said
the
only
thing
she
was
referring
to
was
this
conversation
that
she
had,
none
other.
mr.
j.
b.
look
slick
sligh
was
a
--
was
a
fellow
employee,
so
with
jack
kittrell.
mr.
j.
b.
look
i
don't
believe
it
was,
your
honor.
if
the
bear
--
mere
statement
--
mr.
j.
b.
look
issues
of
credibility
are
for
the
jury,
but
if
she
is
--
if
she
later
on
explained
to
weigh
that
answer
herself
and
you
ask
her,
"who
told
you
not
to
ask
for
help?
what
were
you
referring
to?”
and
she
said
just
that
prior
conversation,
then
of
course
there
is
nothing
--
nothing
in
there.
mr.
j.
b.
look
now,
who
told
her
not
to
ask
for
help?
mr.
j.
b.
look
she
doesn't,
in
that
statement,
state
who
didn't
ask
her
for
help.
remember,
she
was
there
in
monahans
and
no
one
--
she
--
she
was
on
the
stand.
this
isn't
a
case
where
we
have
an
unfortunate
accident
where
somebody
is
dead.
she
was
on
the
stand
and
she
testified
unequivocally
that
she
never
had
intimated
even
a
need
for
help
to
anyone.
mr.
j.
b.
look
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
look
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
look
sir?
mr.
j.
b.
look
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
look
yes,
sir.
we
thought
forth
every
conversation
she
had
with
her
and
she
never
in
any
of
them
requested.
it's
an
absence
of
something
is
what
i'm
trying
to
show
and
of
course
you
can
point
out
--
mr.
j.
b.
look
that
would
be
in
the
--
well,
sir,
perhaps
i
stated
the
converse
of
it,
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
intend
to
--
to
do
that.
what
i'm
getting
at
is
this
--
mr.
j.
b.
look
the
complete
conversation
in
regard
to
this
was
brought
out
that
she
had
with
mr.
higginbotham.
and
actually,
there
was
no
disagreement
between
higginbotham
and
--
and
the
petitioner
at
the
trial
as
to
what
happened.
and
she
said
that's
the
only
conversation
she
had
with
him
and
there's
certainly
nothing
in
there
to
indicate
that
she
had
any
more
conversation.
now,
the
burden
was
on
her
in
this
case.
the
burden
was
on
her.
mr.
j.
b.
look
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
look
the
trial
judge
did,
yes,
your
honor.
now,
the
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit,
a
very
reading
of
it
shows
and
--
that
they
exhaustively
searched
the
record.
it's
right
with
--
with
annotations
and
of
course
what
the
case
amounts
to
is
an
analysis
of
the
facts.
now
then,
we
get
into
this
situation,
may
it
please
the
court.
ordinarily,
when
a
case
turns
upon
merely
an
analysis
of
the
facts
in
the
particular
case,
this
court
does
not
concern
itself
with
those
cases
because
by
the
very
nature
they
are
very
limited
in
our
application.
in
recent
years
particularly
of
course
more
and
more
of
these
cases
like
the
rogers
case,
like
this
case,
like
the
case
yesterday,
two
of
them
i
believe,
and
your
employer-employee
relationship.
now
of
course,
there
--
there
is
no
really
bright
dividing
line
between
negligence
and
non-negligence.
judges
always
have
and
always
will
differ.
this
court
in
the
wilkinson
case
pointed
that
out.
well
then,
here's
the
difficulty.
we
have
our
trial
courts
and
we
have
our
courts
of
appeals,
which
ordinarily
are
intended
to
be
and
are
courts
of
last
resort.
in
other
jurisdictions,
either
by
statute
or
a
court
rule
where
there
are
intermediate
courts,
the
highest
court
will
not
review
questions
of
facts
because
it
necessarily
involves
merely
a
second-guessing.
mr.
j.
b.
look
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
look
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
look
if
it
would
be
read
in
context,
your
honor,
it
said
--
well,
i
told
him
that
the
mexican
had
been
handling
it
and
that
the
trains
had
been
getting
out
and
he
instructed
that
you
were
to
handle
it
personally.
he
said,
"i
was
to
handle
it
anyway
regardless."
mr.
j.
b.
look
yes,
sir.
she
stated
that
she
had
and
previously
gotten
another
employee
to
do
her
work
and
that
the
train
could
still
been
getting
out
on
time.
mr.
j.
b.
look
she
was
talking
to
her
superior.
mr.
j.
b.
look
he
said
that
i
was
hired
out
to
do
a
man's
job
and
had
to
do
it
regardless.
with
that
we're
in
perfect
agreement.
but
if
we
look
at
the
--
mr.
j.
b.
look
she
was
complaining
because
she
couldn't
wear
her
skirts
and
hose
and
trying
to
get
up
on
a
cart
because
she
would
be
exposed
and
be
unladylike.
mr.
j.
b.
look
i
certainly
can't
read
that
construction
in
there,
mr.
chief
justice.
she
stated
that
somebody
else
has
been
doing
it
for
her
voluntarily.
mr.
j.
b.
look
that
is
--
that
is
one
of
the
tests,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
b.
look
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
look
yes.
mr.
j.
b.
look
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
look
it
does
if
you
say
that
the
jury
can
take
any
statement
completely
out
of
context.
mr.
j.
b.
look
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
look
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
look
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
look
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
look
that
is
ordinarily.
but
i
don't
believe
this
statement
can
be
taken
out.
you
can
take
any
statement,
any
one
question
and
answer
completely
out
of
context
mr.
j.
b.
look
and
say
that
presents
the
jury
issue.
mr.
j.
b.
look
no,
sir.
i
--
i
think
that
the
--
the
test
is
whether
taking
the
printed
record
and
with
what
we
have
whether
a
reasonable
man
could
for
more
than
mere
scintilla
of
the
evidence
have
reasonably
arrived
at
the
verdict
that
they
did.
it's
not
what
the
trial
judge
was
--
thought
at
the
time,
but
it's
what
we
have
the
benefit
of
seeing
the
record,
that
is
the
purpose
of
having
the
record.
mr.
j.
b.
look
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
look
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
look
i
--
i
don't
believe
that
a
jury
verdict
means
that
the
trial
judge
would
have
found
it
the
same
way.
mr.
j.
b.
look
yes,
sir,
he
sat
and
left
it
to
--
mr.
j.
b.
look
it
sounds
like
--
he
thought
that
reasonable
man
could
arrive
at
that
answer,
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
look
no,
sir.
the
charge
was
the
plaintiff
alleges
reading
the
sentence
before
them,
sir.
he
was
referring
to
the
allegations.
