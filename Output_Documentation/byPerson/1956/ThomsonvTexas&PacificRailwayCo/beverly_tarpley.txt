ms.
beverly
tarpley
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
arising
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act,
a
suit
involving
an
injured
workman
on
a
railroad.
the
employee
had
been
hired
several
months
before
this
accident
to
perform
the
duties
of
an
agent-operator
on
the
respondent's
railroad
lines.
after
a
few
months
of
training
or
a
short
period
of
training,
she
was
employed
first
of
all
on
what
was
--
what
was
called
the
extra
board.
that
meant
that
she
went
to
various
stations
up
and
down
the
line,
filling
in
for
a
day
or
here
and
there
while
employees
were
on
vacation
or
on
sick
leave.
after
a
period
of
several
months
of
doing
this
kind
of
work,
she
bid
in
and
received
by
a
reason
of
her
seniority
a
regular
job
as
agent
and
operator
on
the
station
at
monahans,
texas,
a
station
in
far
west
texas.
there
on
her
testimony,
it
was
her
job
to
perform
various
duties
of
the
clerical
nature
to
take
care
of
train
orders
and
handling
tickets
and
things
of
that
nature.
when
she
first
went
to
this
job
--
pardon
me,
a
mexican
laborer,
also
an
employee
of
the
respondent
railroad
was
engaged
in
handling
the
mail
which
came
in
on
a
regular
passenger
train,
which
passed
--
passed
through
on
the
petitioner's
shift.
now,
handling
the
mail
meant
loading
up
a
baggage
cart,
that
sort
of
thing,
follow
these
individual
bags
and
mail
which
had
been
prepared
by
the
postal
employees
and
lock
in
the
postal
room,
pulling
that
cart
out
to
the
waiting
train,
climbing
up
on
the
cart
and
picking
up
the
bags
and
mail
individually
and
tossing
them
into
the
post
office
cart,
receiving
incoming
bags
of
mail,
getting
down
and
pulling
the
cart
back
into
the
waiting
mail
room.
now,
as
i
have
said,
when
petitioner
first
went
to
work
on
this
particular
station,
a
mexican
laborer,
who
was
a
witness
in
the
trial
of
this
case,
was
handling
this
mail
and
he
continued
to
handle
it
up
until
two
or
three
days
before
the
petitioner's
injury.
at
that
time,
she
was
told
by
her
immediate
superior,
who
was
the
witness,
higginbotham
that
she
was
to
handle
the
mail,
she
was
to
handle
it
alone
and
with
no
assistance.
there's
no
testimony
in
the
record
that
the
handling
of
the
mail
up
to
this
time
had
been
improper,
that
the
train
could
been
delayed
or
that
the
mexican
laborer
was
no
longer
available.
simply
the
very
statement
that
her
superior
requested
that
she
handle
the
mail.
she
did
so
for
two
or
three
days
and
on
about
the
third
day,
on
the
day
of
the
accident,
she
climbed
down
from
the
mail
cart
after
handling
several
bags
of
mail
weighing
50
to
75
pounds
each,
felt
a
sudden
catch
in
her
back.
shortly
after
that
time,
she
was
taken
into
the
hospital
and
received
various
treatment
over
a
long
period
of
time.
this
case
was
tried
in
the
abilene
division
of
the
northern
district
of
texas
and
a
jury
verdict
was
returned
for
the
petitioner.
the
case
was
reversed
on
its
merits
by
the
fifth
circuit
and
brought
here
by
certiorari.
now,
it
is
our
contention
that
the
fifth
circuit
reversed
this
case
or
reversed
the
jury
verdict
on
two
particular
grounds.
both
of
those
grounds
are
arguments
which
had
been
advanced
before
this
court
in
numerous
decisions
arising
under
this
act
and
have
on
each
instance
been
rejected
by
this
court.
the
first
of
those
arguments,
one
advanced
by
the
railroad,
was
that
this
woman
was
engaged
in
doing
only
the
usual
and
customary
duties
of
her
employment
at
the
time
of
the
accident
or
in
other
words,
the
whole
idea
of
non-negligence.
now,
we
feel
that
the
fifth
circuit
improperly
analyzed
the
record
and
in
arriving
at
their
decision
that
this
was
usual
and
customary
and
therefore
no
negligence,
that
they
rely
on
the
very
argument,
as
i
have
said
which
have
previously
been
advanced
before
this
court
and
rejected.
the
testimony
is
clear
that
it
was
not
usual
and
customary
as
to
this
particular
employee.
the
allegations
of
the
petitioner's
complaint
in
the
trial
court
were
failure
to
furnish
sufficient
help,
failure
to
furnish
a
safe
place
to
work.
and
the
jury
was
charged
on
that
basis
and
on
that
basis,
on
the
basis
of
the
testimony
of
petitioner
and
the
testimony
of
these
other
witnesses
returned
a
verdict
that
she
had
been
furnished
improper
help.
now,
the
first
of
these
cases
arising
before
this
court
after
the
1939
amendment
to
the
act,
which
was
of
course
the
amendment
that
abolished
assumption
of
risk,
was
the
tiller
case
in
which
this
court
set
forth
a
very
exhaustive
opinion
and
set
forth
a
very
complete
summary
of
the
intent
of
congress
and
the
responsibilities
of
the
employer
under
this
act.
the
lower
court
in
the
tiller
case
had
advanced
the
same
theory
that
the
congress
by
abolishing
the
defense
of
assumption
of
risk
had
not
meant
to
increase
the
employer's
responsibility
towards
his
employee.
this
court
said
that
that
was
just
another
way
of
saying
no
negligence
and
assumption
of
risk.
in
other
words,
the
employer
could
not
simply,
by
saying
this
is
a
usual
and
customary
duty,
force
the
employee
to
take
on
whatever
risk
were
involved
in
performing
that
job.
and
as
we
said,
this
was
first
advanced
by
this
court
in
the
tiller
case,
it
has
been
advanced
by
this
court
down
through
the
years
in
the
stone
case,
blair
case,
all
of
which
cases
had
been
cited
by
petitioner
and
reaffirmed
in
fact
by
this
court
in
three
opinions
handed
down
by
this
court
only
last
month,
the
rogers
case
and
the
other
cases
following.
the
second
thing
that
the
fifth
circuit
mentioned
was
a
failure
to
protest
sufficiently
hard
on
the
part
of
the
employee.
the
record
showed
that
several
days
before
this
accident
occurred,
the
petitioner's
immediate
superior
told
her
that
she
had
to
handle
the
mail
and
had
to
do
it
alone.
the
petitioner
then
testified
that
she
had
previously
been
instructed
by
someone
who
was
hired
in
the
railroad
line
of
organization
that
it
had
become
the
railroad's
policy
to
encourage
its
women
employees
to
dress
in
a
manner
becoming
a
woman
and
that
this
made
it
impossible
for
them
to
climb
up
on
carts
and
do
manual
labor.she
told
her
superior
that
and
he
said,
"you're
hired
out
to
do
a
man's
job
and
that's
what
i
intend
for
you
to
do."
ms.
beverly
tarpley
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
ms.
beverly
tarpley
the
--
her
immediate
superior
there
on
the
job,
the
witness
higginbotham,
told
her
in
response
to
her
protest
about
the
fact
that
she
could
not
do
this
job
while
wearing
the
clothing
she'd
been
requested
to
wear
was,
"you
have
hired
out
to
do
a
man's
job
and
now
those
are
the
duties
i
see
fit
for
you
to
do."
ms.
beverly
tarpley
yes,
sir.
she
had
been
requested
to
wear
skirts
and
hose
and
normal
female
attire,
and
such
attire
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
climb
up
on
mail
carts
and
do
the
kind
of
manual
labor
that
her
superior
insisted.
and
during
that
period
of
time,
the
laborer,
who
was
an
employee
of
the
railroad,
had
been
doing
this
work.
so
at
that
point,
on
a
direct
order
from
her
superior,
she
began
doing
the
work
and
after
performing
it
only
two
or
three
times
suffered
an
injury.
now,
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
that
was
a
failure
to
protest
and
said
that
by
reason
of
her
failure
to
protest,
she
could
not
recover
under
the
circumstances.
now,
it
has
been
suggested
--
pardon
me,
it
has
been
suggested
by
the
petitioner
and
we
would
reiterate
here
that
the
conduct
of
the
employee
is
not
the
test
set
forth
by
congress
or
by
this
court
in
its
interpretation
of
the
law
under
--
arising
under
the
statute,
that
it
is
the
conduct
of
the
employer
which
is
the
sole
criteria
for
deciding
whether
or
not
there
is
liability.
i
believe
that
this
court
in
its
case
of
rogers
versus
missouri
pacific,
one
of
the
latest
cases
deciding,
has
said
that
the
only
ground
of
inquiry
for
an
appellate
court
is
whether
or
not
the
negligence
of
the
employer
contributed
in
the
slightest
degree
to
the
injury
of
the
employee.
and
by
reason
of
that
statement
and
it
is
a
statement
which
this
court
has
made
many
times
before,
we
feel
that
the
fifth
circuit
simply
did
not
follow
the
interpretation
of
the
law
laid
down
by
this
court
previously.
they
--
we
feel
that
they
ignored
the
sense
of
this
court's
opinions
in
--
and
put
improper
emphasis
on
her
conduct.
under
those
circumstances,
we
feel
that
the
decision
of
the
trial
court
ought
to
be
affirmed.
ms.
beverly
tarpley
may
it
please
the
court.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
in
which
has
been
advanced
here
is
simply
an
indication
of
the
fact
that
this
was
a
fact
question
involved,
which
was
properly
left
in
the
jury
and
in
the
trial
--
trial
judges'
wisdom
was
left
to
the
jury
and
that
it
should
have
been
so
left.
the
petitioner
testified
that
she
had
asked
for
help
and
had
been
--
or
rather
that
she
had
been
instructed
not
to
ask
for
help.
the
witness
higginbotham
on
page
89
of
the
record
testified
that
this
was
not
her
sole
duty
and
that
she
was
only
to
assist
in
handling
the
mail.
there's
a
square
conflict
of
fact
between
the
two
witnesses
or
between
the
testimony
of
two
witnesses.
and
certainly,
that's
--
by
its
very
essence,
the
type
of
thing
which
should
be
left
to
a
jury
determination
in
which
the
trial
judge
in
his
wisdom
did
leave
to
a
jury
determination.
now,
throughout
the
record
there
are
simply
conflicts
of
fact
which
should
and
all
through
have
been
left
to
a
jury
determination,
and
that
determination
ought
to
be
upheld.
the
respondent
has
said
over
and
over
again
that
the
petitioner
or
that
the
railroad
was
not
apprised
of
the
danger
of
this
work.
but
again,
we
have
the
testimony
of
the
petitioner
that
she
had
been
told
that
this
was
a
man's
work.
certainly,
that
shows
notice
within
itself
that
this
was
the
type
of
work
which
a
woman
ought
not
to
be
required
to
handle
without
assistance.
now
--
ms.
beverly
tarpley
the
honorable
t.
whitfield
davidson,
who
is
now
--
ms.
beverly
tarpley
well,
over
20
years.
he's
now
the
presiding
judge
of
the
northern
district,
if
the
court
please.
and
this
court
has
held
in
the
case
of
lillie
versus
thompson,
which
was
the
case
in
which
a
woman
who
has
suffered
a
criminal
attack
in
a
poorly
lighted
section
of
the
freight
yard.
this
court
held
that
an
employer
had
to
reasonably
anticipate
the
dangers
of
a
particular
situation
as
those
would
affect
a
particular
employee
and
had
to
anticipate
those
dangers.
that's
exactly
the
same
type
of
thing
that
is
present
here.
an
employer
would
have
to
anticipate
the
danger
to
an
employee
of
requiring
that
employee
to
handle
work
which
was
beyond
her
physical
strength.
in
short,
we
think
that
this
case
has
one
issue
and
one
issue
alone
and
that
is
that
under
all
the
circumstances,
under
all
the
conflicts
and
the
testimony
that
this
was
a
jury
matter
and
as
this
court
has
said
repeatedly
again
and
again,
one
that
should
have
been
left
to
the
jury
determination.
that
the
jury
having
reached
the
decision,
that
that
decision
should
not
be
upset
by
second-guessing
in
the
record
or
sitting
here
and
attempting
to
construct
inferences
out
of
the
printed
record
when
the
jurors
have
the
benefit
of
the
living
witnesses
in
the
court's
charge.
has
--
it
has
been
said
this
court
repeated
again
in
--
in
the
rogers
case
that
under
all
the
circumstances
if
in
the
slightest
degree,
this
court
--
the
employer's
negligence
contributed
to
the
employee's
injury
then
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
apply.
it
also
said
in
the
schulz
case
that
if
the
evidence
was
such
that
the
--
the
jury
could
in
reasonable
probability
arrived
at
a
verdict
of
negligence
that
verdict
should
not
be
disturbed.
there
is
this
final
factor
which
i
would
like
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
in
which
i
think
suggest
the
basis
for
the
decisions
of
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
decision
advocated
by
the
respondent
here.
in
neither
the
respondent's
brief
nor
in
the
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit
have
the
latest
pronouncements
of
this
court
been
advocated
as
authority
for
those
decisions.
in
the
respondent's
brief,
not
one
case
of
this
court
is
cited
as
authority
for
the
proposition
that
this
situation
presents
a
case
of
non-negligence
or
that
this
is
a
case
which
should
not
have
been
left
to
the
jury.
the
same
is
true
of
the
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit,
which
was
based
primarily
on
the
wadiak
case,
a
case
out
of
the
fifth
--
of
the
seventh
circuit.
we
feel
under
all
those
circumstances
that
both
the
respondent
and
the
fifth
circuit
have
refused
to
follow
the
latest
pronouncements
of
this
court
and
have
on
that
basis
and
that
basis
alone,
on
the
theory
which
they
have
which
differs
from
this
court
have
decided
that
this
case
should
have
been
taken
from
the
jury.
ms.
beverly
tarpley
no,
sir,
i'm
sorry.
i
said
that
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
cite
as
authority
the
latest
pronouncements
of
this
court.
ms.
beverly
tarpley
if
the
court
please,
i'm
not
prepared
to
present
other
cases.
i
--
i
have
a
personal
opinion
--
ms.
beverly
tarpley
--
which
the
court
is
not
interested
in,
i
wouldn't
imagine
--[laughter]
ms.
beverly
tarpley
yes,
sir,
i
do.
ms.
beverly
tarpley
yes,
sir.
i
sincerely
feel
so.
ms.
beverly
tarpley
well
--
ms.
beverly
tarpley
may
i
cite
a
specific
--
ms.
beverly
tarpley
--
example
which
is
beyond
the
realm
--
ms.
beverly
tarpley
well
--
ms.
beverly
tarpley
well
--
ms.
beverly
tarpley
yes,
sir.
ms.
beverly
tarpley
if
i
may
say
this,
after
the
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit
and
this
case
was
handed
down
and
prior
to
the
term
--
the
petitioner's
term
for
motion
for
rehearing
had
expired,
this
court
published
it's
opinion
in
the
case
of
schulz
versus
pennsylvania
railroad
which
was
a
jones
act
case
and
similar
of
course
on
the
liability
angle,
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
in
that
case,
this
court
said
that
negligence
cannot
be
measured
like
a
--
an
acre
of
ground
but
that
is
something
that
should
be
left
to
the
--
the
sound
discretion
of
the
jury.
that
case
was
particularly
called
to
the
attention
of
the
fifth
circuit
by
the
petitioner
in
her
motion
for
rehearing
and
that
motion
for
rehearing
was
overruled
without
opinion.
thank
you.
