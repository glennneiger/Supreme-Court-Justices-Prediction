justice
william
o.
douglas
there
was
testimony
that
judge
cameron
puts
in
the
footnote
on
page
191?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
she
said,
"i
have
been
instructed
i
was
not
to
ask
but
i
couldn't
have
anyone
to
work
the
mail
with
me,
there
wasn't
any
need
to
ask."
justice
william
o.
douglas
in
footnote
5
on
page
191.
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
do
you
--
what
do
you
say
to
the
testimony
at
the
bottom
of
page
18
in
the
record?
this
was
on
direct
examination
i
gather.
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
on
direct
examination,
she
did
not
intimate
that
she'd
been
instructed
to
form
the
mail
handling
alone
and
was
not
to
request
assistance.
that's
in
the
footnote,
page
191.
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
bottom
of
page
18,
it
indicates
on
direct
examination
that
she
says
she
was
instructed
to
handle
it
alone.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
he
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
at
page
168,
near
the
top,
he
instructed
the
jury
on
this
point
we're
talking
about
that
she
asked
her
superiors
for
help
to
unload
the
heavy
mails,
which
was
refused
her
although
assistants
were
then
available.
so
he's
been
reading
that
--
he
was
reading
that
record
or
listening
to
the
witnesses.
it's
quite
differently
from
the
interpretation
that
you
could
get.
