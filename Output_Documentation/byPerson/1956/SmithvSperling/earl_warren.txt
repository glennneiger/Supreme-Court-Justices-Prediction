mr.
williams,
before
you
get
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
you
--
we
get
off
of
this
subject,
i
--
i
noticed
in
that
sentence
you
read
of
mr.
levy's
on
page
587,
i
have
no
further
evidence
to
offer.
the
record
shows
also
that
he
said,
"under
those
circumstances."
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
--
now
preceding
--
preceding
that,
is
what
he
calls
your
admission
and
what
you
call
your
statement
of
your
position.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
preceding
that
was
a
dialogue
between
the
court
and
mr.
levy
in
which
the
court
said,
"is
there
any
further
evidence
to
be
offered
on
the
issues
as
to
jurisdiction
limitation
or
latches?"
and
mr.
levy
said,
"may
it
please
the
court,
i
have
been
thinking
over
very
carefully,
some
of
the
questions,
your
honor,
propounded
to
me
yesterday
in
our
discussion
with
respect
to
the
meaning
of
hostility,
antagonism
and
so
forth.
i
was
wondering
whether
a
cross-examination
of
the
principal
characters
in
this
drama
would
shed
any
light
on
that
particular
subject.
in
the
present
state
of
the
record
your
honor
has
before
you
the
depositions
of
certain
people."
and
then
he
goes
on
to
say,
"i
have
not
cross-examined
any
of
these
people.
it
may
be
that
a
cross-examination
of
them
will
yield
further
light
on
the
question.
namely,
is
there
hostility?
is
there
antagonism
between
the
corporation
as
composed
of
the
individuals
who
influenced
its
day-to-day
conduct
and
responsible
for
its
basic
policy
and
so
--
and
so
forth?"
and
then
comes
what
he
calls
your
admission.
and
then
he
says,
"i
have
no
further
evidence
to
offer
under
those
circumstances,
but
that
would‚Äù
--
would
that
not
indicate
that
there
was
not
a
full
hearing
on
the
question
of
the
interest
of
these
people
but
that
when
he
said,
"i
have
no
further
evidence
to
offer"
that
it
was
in
relation
to
a
particular
situation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
its
appropriate
order,
i
suppose
that's
an
order
