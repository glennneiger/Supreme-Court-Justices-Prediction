j.
brennan,

otherwise,
you
would
always
have
a
realignment
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
of
the
corporation
on
the
other
side.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
see.
does
that
mean,
do
you
read
that
as
saying
that
it's
not
enough
to
show
that
however
corrupt
maybe
the
board
of
directors
and
however
corrupt
their
motivation
not
to
bring
the
action,
the
stockholder
has
actually
to
show
that
the
corporation
itself
is
a
captive
of
the
defendants
not
connected
with
the
corporation?
do
you
go
that
far?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
in
fact
exercising
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
in
the
light
of
these
findings
which
you
said
you're
willing
to
accept
for
the
purposes
of
your
argument,
as
i
understand
it
you
believe
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
will
you
phrase
what
you
think
the
rule
is
in
the
light
of
these
findings?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
in
light
of
these
findings?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
levy,
you
--
you
said
at
the
very
outset
of
your
argument
that
you
did
not
agree
with
mr.
doyle's
answer
to
me
in
the
previous
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
findings
of
the
fact
made
here
by
judge
mathes
are
the
very
findings
which
i
hypothesized
from
mr.
doyle
when
i
put
in
the
question
to
him,
namely,
when
acting
in
good
faith
and
in
the
exercise
of
an
independent
business
judgment,
they
resolve
not
to
bring
the
suit.
mr.
doyle's
proposition
was
that
never
let
--
in
that
circumstance,
the
corporation
was
to
be
aligned
on
the
side
of
the
defendant
as
i
understood
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
mr.
levy,
what
do
you
mean
he
didn't
find
out?
what
--
what
am
i
reading
at
75?
and
that
even
the
corporation
nor
the
directors
or
officers
were
shown
that
they
at
that
time
or
at
anytime
under
the
domination
or
control
of
the
three
brothers,
warner
above
name,
what
do
you
mean
he
didn't
find
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
schwab,
if
the
court
had
arrived
at
the
opposite
conclusion
and
had
found
that
the
corporation
should
have
been
realigned
as
a
party
defendant,
do
i
understand
from
what
you
and
mr.
williams
have
said
that
on
this
record,
automatically
then,
there
would
have
been
a
judgment
on
the
merits
for
the
plaintiff?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
--
then,
that's
now
to
tell
us
then
that
there
has
not
been
a
complete
trial
on
merits.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
mr.
williams
told
us
earlier
that
the
evidence
was
actually
that
would
which
would
constitute
a
complete
