what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
have
to
be
proven
on
--
according
to
your
viewpoint
in
order
to
make
it
antagonistic?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
this
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
they'd
have
to
prove
facts
of
what
they
allege
as
the
ground
for
relief,
would
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
would
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
would
have
to
prove
that
what
the
allege
here
is
a
basis
for
the
recovery,
setting
aside
to
this
contract,
that
these
directors
illegally,
wrongfully
in
that
state
to
pay
--
conspired
to
do
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
you
--
from
your
standpoint,
they
have
no
jurisdiction
unless
they
can
recover
on
the
merits.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
this
particular
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
--
has
that
--
has
that
been
tried
out?
have
they
--
has
it
issued
and
tried
out
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
court
find
that
they
did
not
illegally
or
wrongfully
and
in
bad
faith
conspired?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
it
decided?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
--
your
--
your
argument
here
that
--
that
they
have
tested
out
the
real
basic
issue
in
this
basis?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
shows
the
court
didn't
have
jurisdiction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
did
--
they
have
decided
here,
put
in
our
claim
that
they'd
put
in
all
the
evidence
that
they
had
to
show
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
they
acted
illegally
and
so
forth.
and
then,
can
we
really
consider
that
as
a
moral
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
trial
on
the
merits
of
the
controversy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
on
the
issue
of
whether
they
had
acted
illegally
and
fraudulently
and
so
forth?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought,
maybe
i
was
wrong.
did
i
understand
mr.
levy
to
say
that
this
issue
have
not
been
cited
out
and
he
had
not
been
given
a
chance
to
try
it
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
although
you
called
it
the
jurisdiction,
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
reacted
at
the
issue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
merit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
--
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'd
like
to
have
your
viewpoint.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
can
discuss
it
when
it
gets
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
into
full
rise.
i'd
like
to
have
your
viewpoint
of
it.
i
like
to
have
your
answer.
what
sort
of
proof
of
the
allegation
that
it's
made
as
to
the
invalidity
of
this
contract
and
showing
that
the
contract
has
been
made
by
these
--
to
this
company
with
these
three
men
on
the
board
of
directors,
a
son-in-law,
one
of
the
warner,
under
the
circumstances
they
alleged.
what
sort
of
proof
of
those
facts
would
you
say
would
have
been
sufficient
to
hold
that
the
--
that
the
warner
brothers
should
be
aligned
as
a
defendant
rather
than
a
plaintiff?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'd
like
to
get
your
judgment
to
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
what
is
the
ground
here
basically,
a
fraud
charged
against
it,
the
--
to
make
--
be
made
the
basis
for
setting
aside
this
contract
between
warner
brothers
and
the
united?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what's
the
difference
between
that
issue
and
the
issue
that
you
say
would
require
to
be
proven
to
show
that
the
--
the
party
should
be
realized?
justice
hugo
l.
black
none?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
saying
that
under
the
evidence,
it
was
stipulated
not
enough
to
prove
the
allegations
they
made
of
course.
but
suppose
the
allegations
had
been
proven,
just
as
they
made
them
or
the
illegality
and
so
forth,
would
that
have
the
matter
it
require
to
realign
with
the
party?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
they
had
shown
exactly
what
the
alleged
in
the
complaint
as
a
ground
to
set
it
aside,
would
that
have
required
the
realignment
of
them
as
a
party
defendant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
some
quote
on
that
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
say
he
had
an
unlimited
opportunity.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
have
that
when
the
issues
were
limited
if
--
if
the
issue
was
really
tried
out
on
the
basis
of
showing
or
giving
him
a
chance
to
prove
the
fraud
he
alleged
which
was
made
of
realignment.
why
should
it
have
been
limited
to
the
question
of
jurisdiction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
choose
being
its
in
depth,
he
had
the
right
to
and
yes,
he
had
a
right
to
offer
up
all
evidence
such
in
the
merits
of
his
claim
and
if
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
your
adversary
is
right
on
what
he
claimed
has
to
be
established
in
order
to
realign
the
target,
how
could
you
decide
it
in
this
case
without
deciding
the
merits
of
your
action?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
are
saying
is
that
you
do
not
have
to
try
the
merits.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
you
say
that
that
can't
be
wrong.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
your
test
is
right
and
that
under
your
test
that
the
--
entitled
for
him
to
try
the
case.
