mr.
eugene
d.
williams
(voice

--
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
will
i
start
now,
your
honor?
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
it
has
been
well
pointed
out
by
judge
--
more
and
more
of
the
justices
that
they
should
first
find
out
what
the
facts
are
in
determining
that
framework,
what
rule
of
law
is
after.
we
suggest
most
definitely
that
the
facts
are
those
which
are
found
by
judge
mathes
after
a
full
scale
trial
lasting
15
days,
consuming
2000
pages
of
transcript
and
many
hundreds
of
dozens
of
exhibits.
on
the
single
question
or
the
double
question
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
district
courts
to
entertain
the
action
and
the
questions
of
whether
the
statute
of
limitations
was
a
bar
to
the
taking
of
the
action
and
the
fact
that
those
two
issues
were
coupled
is
logical
because
the
issue
of
realignment
and
diversity
jurisdictions
depended
on
the
question
of
whether
the
corporation
was
in
hands
hostile
to
its
interest
or
whether
it
was
dominated
by
the
wrongdoers
or
otherwise
unable
to
protect
itself.
and
also
basically,
the
question
of
statute
of
limitations
depended
upon
a
finding
of
fact
covering
the
same
subject
matter
because
if
the
corporation
had
been
unable
to
protect
its
own
interests,
the
statute
of
limitations
would
not
have
been
running
against
the
action,
whereas
if
it
were
able
to
protect
his
own
interest,
it
would
have
been.
however,
in
view
of
judge
mathes'
decision
with
reference
to
the
--
to
the
basic
question
of
diversity
of
jurisdiction,
he
never
came
to
the
point
and
obviously,
he
could
not
come
to
the
point
of
deciding
the
--
the
second
question
of
statute
of
limitations
because
he
had
no
jurisdiction
to
decide
anything
except
that
he
had
no
jurisdiction.
i
may
say,
if
the
court
please,
that
frankly
we
were
a
little
disappointed
at
the
judges
decision
realizing
the
sincerity
of
his
approach
and
the
meticulous
regard
which
judge
mathes
had
for
the
limits
of
federal
jurisdiction,
a
--
a
regard
which
is
probably
unusual
and
probably
accounts
for
the
fact
that
there
hasn't
been,
so
far
as
i
know,
another
case
just
like
this
where
so
much
evidence
has
been
taken
where
the
real
issues
have
really
been
decided
because
i
suspect
in
many
cases
where
judges
who
had
less
regard
for
the
limits
of
federal
jurisdiction,
they
may
have
gone
ahead
and
decided
the
cases
on
the
merits
in
favor
of
the
defendants,
they
never
came
up
on
this
point.
but
judge
mathes
did
have
that
regard
and
as
you're
--
this
court
will
find
when
the
examination
of
his
very
scholarly
opinion,
he
--
he
had
a
great
deal
of
thought
and
--
and
sincere
work
to
the
solution
of
the
problem.
however,
with
all
this
background
of
evidence,
he
made
findings
of
facts
which
appears
to
me
it
would
be
utterly
decisive
of
this
case
in
view
of
our
understanding
of
the
meaning
and
effect
of
doctor
against
harrington
and
venner
against
great
northern
and
--
and
koster
against
lumbermens
mutual
and
so
forth.
he
found
this,
and
i
think
it's
worth
reading
these
findings
in
full
because
they're
not
too
long
and
yet,
they
are
the
very
crux
of
this
case,
that
the
board
of
directors
of
warner
brothers
pictures,
inc.
is
composed
of
11
men
of
whom
the
defendants,
harry
m.
warner
and
jack
l.warner
and
their
brother
albert
warner,
not
a
defendant,
but
three,
that
the
contract
in
controversy
was
made
and
entered
into
in
good
faith
and
without
fraud.
and
said
contract
was
intended
by
the
directors
to
be
of
financial
benefit
to
warner
brothers
pictures,
inc.
and
its
stockholders.
and
said
contract
was
considered
by
said
11
members
of
the
board
of
directors
of
warner
brothers
pictures,
inc.
to
be
a
sound
business
arrangement
for
the
best
interest
and
future
interests
of
the
--
for
the
best
present
and
future
interests
of
the
corporation.
that
in
approving
and
authorizing
the
contract,
the
officers
and
board
of
directors
acted
in
good
faith
and
exercised
their
independent
business
judgment
that
at
time
of
the
execution
of
the
contract,
albert
warner,
together
with
the
defendants
harry
m.
warner
and
jack
l.
warner,
owned
less
than
20%
of
the
outstanding
shares
of
stock
of
warner
brothers
pictures,
inc.
and
that
neither
the
corporation
nor
the
directors
or
officers
were
shown
to
be
at
that
time
or
at
any
time
under
the
domination
or
control
of
the
three
brothers
warner
above

that
neither
the
stockholders,
its
officers
or
directors
were
at
any
time
involved
in
this
action

to
the
financial
interest

or
more

it
is
not
true
that

that
those
to
whom

findings

rely

i
considered
to

gist

therefore,

shall,

to
read
the
further
findings

i
believe
to
be

finding

"that

and
the

--

that's
correct.
mr.
eugene
d.

yes.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
well,
i
don't
know
that
they
begged
the
question
because
the
problem
we
have
here
may
turn
on
the
question
of
domination.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
yes,
yes.
well,
of
course
as
i
can
--
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
now,
in
connection
with
this
matter
of
the
demand
would
have
been
futile.
counsel
has
not
given
your
honors
the
complete
picture
on
that.
the
record
shows,
and
i
believe
that
--
it's
at
record
page
588,
the
so-called
admissions
in
connection
with
the
futility
of
the
findings
and
i
think
that
the
examination
of
the
record
is
important
because
the
record
is
what
we're
interested
in.
it
appears
at
pages
587
and
586
in
which
the
court
inquired
of
may,
i
should
assume
unless
there
is
some
contention
expressly
made
to
the
contrary
that
this
corporation
would
never
have
brought
this
suit.
is
there
any
contention
to
the
contrary?
and
i
say,
we
don't
make
such
a
contention.
then,
the
court
--
i
skip
--
and
the
court
goes
down
to
say,
“so
far
as
demand
and
refusal
are
concerned,
i
take
it
that
the
defendant
in
effect
stipulates
in
such
a
--
that
a
demand
would
have
been
futile."
mr.
williams,
"but
not
for
the
reasons
alleged
in
the
complaint."
the
court,
"no,
but
for
the
reasons
contended
by
the
defendant.”
mr.
williams,
“certainly,
not
for
the
reason
that
the
defendants
ever
contended
that
the
contract
was
fraudulent.”
the
court,
"as
i
understand,
defendant's
position
and
i
can
be
corrected
if
i
am
in
error,
the
defendant's
position
is
that
this
was
an
advantageous
arrangement
for
warner
--
for
the
warner
corporation.
and
the
directors
would
have
--
have
upheld
it
at
any
time
against
any
attack
by
any
person
including
any
group
of
stockholders."
mr.
levy,
“that
is
the
position
of
both
the
individual
defendants,
warner
brothers
and
the
corporation.
all
of
them
contend
likewise.”
mr.
williams,
“the
individual
defendants,
warner
brothers,
are
not
involved
in
that
issue.
it
is
the
corporation
that
is
involved
in
that
issue.”
the
court,
“and
for
those
reasons,
no
matter
what
demand
the
plaintiff
stockholder
had
made
on
the
directors,
they
would
never
have
brought
this
suit,
is
that
a
fair
statement
of
it?”
mr.
williams,
“yes,
that
is
a
fair
statement
but
not
for
the
reasons
alleged
in
the
complaint
that
there
was
domination
but
for
the
reason
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
responsible
officers
and
directors
of
the
corporation,
this
was
a
good
contract.”
the
court,
“by
good,
you
mean
advantageous
to
the
corporation?”
mr.
williams,
“advantageous
to
the
warner
corporation,
yes.”
now,
that
is
the
so-called
admission
which
was
made
and
we
regard
it
as
a
statement,
rather
than
an
admission,
a
statement
of
our
position.
now,
the
findings
which
i
have
taken
the
liberty
of
reading
to
this
court
were
considered
and
the
evidence
supporting
those
findings
was
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
no
reason
to
disturb
the
findings
after
the
examination
of
the
record.
and
so,
stated
at
--
at
page
5
of
the
supplement
appendix
1
attached
to
the
petition
in
this
case
where
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
set
forth
in
full.
i,
therefore,
take
it
that
in
this
case,
we
are
justified
in
taking
the
position
that
the
questions
which
will
be
decided
by
this
court,
the
basic
questions
of
law,
will
be
decided
on
the
assumption
that
the
findings
of
this
court
determined
of
--
of
the
lower
court,
determined
the
facts,
the
court
will
not
in
view
of
the
record
in
this
case
and
the
type
and
character
of
the
petition
for
the
writ
of
certiorari
and
the
--
that
was
filed
will
not
go
back
of
the
court's
findings,
the
court
of
appeals
having
found
that
the
findings
were
supported
by
the
evidence.
if
i
may
narrow
that,
why
i
am
--
i'm
very
seriously
narrow
because
there
has
not
been
brought
before
this
court
by
any
means,
the
--
the
full
evidence
in
the
case,
only
a
fragmentary
portion
of
the
evidence.
because
we
have
assumed
that
in
view
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
there
would
be
no
desire
on
the
part
of
this
court
to
dig
into
the
specific
facts
underlying
the
findings
and
--
and
i
am
proceeding
in
my
argument
upon
that
theory.
now,
counsel
has
said
that
he
does
not
question
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
support
the
findings.
and
on
the
other
hand,
he
--
he
--
at
another
point,
he
said
in
response
to
a
question
by
one
of
the
associate
justices
that
he
didn't
think
the
evidence
did
support
the
findings
and
then
at
another
point,
he
--
he
went
back
to
his
original
suggestion.
what
he
has
attempted
to
do,
i
believe,
is
without
making
an
--
a
direct
attack
upon
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
support
the
findings,
he
has
taken
certain
fragmentary
and
disconnected
evidentiary
facts
and
talked
about
them
without
giving
the
full
story
in
any
particular.
and
obviously,
i
cannot
and
do
not
believe
i
should.
at
this
time,
endeavor
can
beyond
the
court's
findings
and
try
to
engage
in
discussion
as
to
what
the
evidence
has
been
omitted
in
his
statement
or
what
other
evidence
was
there.
now,
we
believe
that
the
rule
of
law
which
has
been
established
by
this
court
is
as
follows,
we
believe
that
this
court
has
stated
that
in
a
stockholder's
derivative
suit,
the
corporation
will
ordinarily
and
normally
be
aligned
as
a
party
plaintiff
because
it
is
the
entity
for
whose
benefit
the
action
is
being
brought
and
the
pursuit
or
entity
which
will
recover
the
judgment
if
any.
it
is
the
real
party
in
address.
but,
that
there
is
an
exception
to
that
rule
and
that
exception
is
a
limited
and
special
exception.
when
the
corporation
is
a
captive
corporation,
when
it
is
in
hands
antagonistic
to
its
financial
analysts,
when
it
is
unable
by
reason
of
that
captivity
and
being
in
such
antagonistic
hands
to
properly
represent
itself,
there
is
an
exception
and
in
that
case,
it
will
be
aligned
as
a
party
defendant.
we
believe
that
is
the
true
meaning
of
doctor
versus
harrington.
we
believe
that
is
the
true
meaning
of
venner
against
the
great
northern
and
we
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
it
is
very
tertiary
and
very
well
stated
by
this
court
in
the
case
of
koster
against
lumbermens
mutual
in
which
the
court
epitomized
the
rule,
as
i
understand
it
as
follows.
the
cause
of
action
which
such
a
plaintiff,
it
is
a
stockholder,
brings
before
the
court
is
not
his
own
but
the
corporations.
if
it's
the
real
party
in
interest
and
he
is
allowed
to
act
in
protection
of
its
interests,
somewhat
as
a
next
friend
might
do
for
an
individual,
because
it
is
disabled
from
protecting
itself,
if
however,
such
a
case
as
this
were
treated
in
--
as
other
actions,
the
federal
court
would
realign
the
parties
for
jurisdictional
purposes
according
to
their
real
interest.
in
this
case,
which
his
typical
of
many,
this
would
put
lumbermens
on
the
plaintiff's
side.
illinois
corporations
would
then
appear
among
plaintiffs
and
among
defendants
and
jurisdiction
would
be
ousted.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
the
corporation
would
automatically
be
--
be
aligned
as
a
plaintiff.
i
am
now
coming
to
the
very
--
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
as
a
plaintiff.
i
am
now
coming
to
the
very
gist
of
the
point
when
i
read
the
last
sentence
of
the
quotation
i
was
about
--
that
i
was
making.
"but
jurisdiction
is
saved
in
this
class
of
cases
by
a
special
dispensation
because
the
corporation
is
in
antagonistic
hands."
in
other
words,
i
believe
the
rule
established
by
these
cases,
by
this
court,
is
that
the
corporation
will
always
be
aligned
as
a
plaintiff
unless
it
is
in
antagonistic
hands
--
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
--
or
is
a
captive
corporation.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
would
have
to
be
proved?
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
in
this
case,
it
would
have
to
be
proved
that
the
directors
or
the
majority
of
the
directors
were
antagonistic
to
the
interest
of
the
corporation.
that
is
between
the
corporation
and
the
alleged
wrong
doers.
they
were
willing
to
serve
the
interest
of
the
wrong
doers
rather
than
the
interest
of
the
corporation.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
in
--
in
our
case
--
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
--
in
this
particular
case
--
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
in
this
particular
case,
yes.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
in
this
particular
case.
well,
i
think
--
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
yes.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
yes.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
i
just
got
through
reading
the
finding.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
yes.
i
say
--
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
that's
correct.
i
say
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor,
the
issue
upon
which
the
plaintiff
sets
his
cause
of
action,
puts
his
cause
of
action
is
coextensive
with
the
issue,
which
the
court
tries
on
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
yes.
i
will
say
this.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
i
will
say
this,
if
your
honors
please,
that
at
page
588
of
the
record
or
587
of
the
record,
mr.
levy,
who
represented
the
plaintiff
in
the
case
said
that
he
--
"i
have
no
further
evidence
to
offer."
now
we
had
--
and
that
was
on
the
issue
of
domination,
which
involved
the
very
gist
of
the
whole
case.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
naturally,
because
the
issue
of
domination
inevitably
involved
the
whole
question
or
the
entire
conduct
with
reference
to
this
transaction.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
what
mr.
levy
said,
if
i
understood
him,
and
what
i
will
say
to
is
this.
that
the
court
limited
the
taking
of
evidence
to
the
question,
the
two
questions
of
jurisdiction
and
statute
of
limitations
which
involve
the
same
basic
evidentiary
matter.
in
this
particular
case,
because
of
the
allegations
of
the
complaint,
that
evidence
also
necessarily
included
the
very
facts
upon
which
the
claim
was
based.
and
while
we
have
not
ever
gotten
to
the
merits
of
the
case,
we
had
put
on
all
of
the
evidence,
practically,
all
evidence
on
either
side
could
have
had
on
the
merits
because
they
were
--
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
no.
no,
we
--
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
yes,
we
really
--
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
yes,
we
really
tried
that
issue.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
yes.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
certainly.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
no,
your
honor.
i
do
not
say
that.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
i
say
that
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
yes
--
no,
i
don't
say
that.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
i
say
that
the
question
of
whether
the
real
merits
will
be
tried
by
the
court
in
this
preliminary
investigation
and
to
its
own
jurisdiction
must
depend
on
the
facts
of
each
case
as
to
whether
the
merits
are
or
are
not
in
disagreeably
mixed-up
with
the
--
with
other
questions.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
i
think
--
yes.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
i
think
your
honor
is
correct.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
[laughs]
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
i
think
your
honor
is
correct
and
--
and
i
think
the
word
"disabled"
is
right
and
i
--
and
i
was
struck
as
--
with
the
appropriateness
of
the
expression
“captive
corporation”
which
was
used
by
some
of
the
justices.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
yes.
now,
if
your
honor
please,
that
puts
in
--
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
yes.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
that's
--
that's
when
i
had
stated
that
--
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
that's
correct.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
no.
if
your
honor
please,
it
cannot
possibly
indicate
that.
in
this
case,
the
testimony
of
every
director
and
of
the
number
of
officers
who
were
not
directors
of
warner
brothers
and
other
individuals
was
presented
to
the
district
court.
it
was
presented
either
by
examination
in
open
court
or
by
the
reading
of
their
depositions.
in
the
case
of
the
depositions,
the
--
the
officers
and
directors
had
been
cross-examined
at
length
by
the
counsel
who
appeared
at
the
taping
of
the
depositions.
consequently,
the
evidence
was
before
the
court
and
in
extensile
before
the
court.
two
of
the
directors
had
testified
for
days.
the
depositions
of
all
the
other
directors
had
been
offered
in
evidence.
a
hundred
in
our
exhibits
have
been
received
in
evidence.
the
--
the
testimony
of
numerable
individuals
had
been
received
in
evidence.
the
testimony
of
the
plaintiffs
by
way
of
deposition
had
been
received
in
evidence.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
because
they
were
residence
of
new
york
and
--
and
pennsylvania
and
depositions
were
taken
for
that
reason.
and
we're
taking
some
time
in
advance
to
the
trial.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
they
were
done
by
stipulation,
i
think.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
and
now,
mr.
levy
was
thinking
out
loud
and
decided
that
he
didn't
want
to
ask
anymore
questions.
he
--
if
he
did
want
to
ask
any,
all
he
had
to
do
was
say
so.
but
he
decided
at
that
point
as
he
said
that
under
those
circumstances
i
have
no
further
evidence
to
offer.
there
was
other
evidence
that
i
might
have
offered
but
i
--
i
felt
that
at
that
time,
the
entire
factual
picture
wasn't
before
the
court.
and
so,
i
say
that
--
if
your
honors
please,
that
there
was
as
full
and
complete,
a
hearing
of
the
facts
upon
which
these
findings
are
placed
as
--
as
they
could
have
well
have
been.
and
--
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
yes,
sir.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
yes.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
yes.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
you
mean
the
warner
corporations?
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
yes.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
i
think
--
i
think,
if
your
honor
please,
in
this
particular
case
in
view
of
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
in
this
case
that
there
is
very
little
shot
of
that
that
--
that
could
have
satisfied
that
point.
in
other
words,
this
case
is
based
upon
the
allegation
that
the
brothers,
warner,
two
of
the
brothers
warner,
conceived
the
idea
of
enriching
the
son-in-law
of
one
of
them
at
the
expense
of
the
corporation.
and
that
they
imposed
this
contract
upon
the
corporation
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
they
dominated
and
controlled
the
board
of
directors.
that
is
the
essence
of
the
charge.
now,
the
essence
of
the
charge
then
becomes
the
question
--
the
essence
of
the
issue
is
was
the
board
of
directors
dominated?
in
this
particular
case,
the
board
of
directors
which
approved
the
contract
was
the
same
board
of
directors
which
was
on
the
--
was
in
--
man
of
the
corporation
with
one
exception.
at
this
time,
the
suit
was
filed
and
that
all
of
the
intervening
time.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
eleven.
i
might
say
that
the
record
shows
that
mr.
harry
warner
and
jack
warner
did
not
participate
in
the
board
meeting
which
approved
this
contract.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
they
held
--
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
they
held
with
their
brother,
albert,
a
total
of
15%
of
the
stock.and
the
court
found
that
they
did
not
have
control
of
the
corporation
or
the
directors.
now,
that
brings
us
to
a
consideration
of
what
i
consider
and
i
--
i
may
be
wrong
about
it
but
i
consider
a
very
important
element
in
this
case.
and
of
course,
under
the
rule
of
erie
against
tompkins,
this
being
a
diversity
case
upon
the
merits.
the
--
the
federal
court
will
apply
the
law
of
the
firm,
the
law
of
the
state.
and
we
have
cited
cases
in
our
brief.
on
a
point,
there
is
one
rather
recent
case
in
california
that
is
particularly
significant
that
involved
the
douglas
aircraft
corporation,
the
case
of
finley
versus
garrett,
in
which
the
california
rule
in
reference
to
this
matter
was
laid
down.
there
was
a
case
where
there
was
a
--
a
rather
a
very
extensive
claim
alleged
by
a
stockholder
to
subsist
in
favor
of
the
corporation
based
upon
part
in
the
overreaching
of
the
corporation,
interlocking
the
right
place
and
things
of
that
sort
and
the
man
was
made
on
the
directors
of
--
of
the
douglas
aircraft
corporation
that
they
sue.
and
the
matter
rose
on
demurrer
to
the
complaint,
and
the
court
held.
now,
here's
the
case
where
the
directors
in
charge
of
the
corporation
at
that
time,
the
majority
of
the
directors
in
charge
of
the
corporation
at
the
time
that
suit
was
demanded
and
refused
are
not
shown
by
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
who
have
been
dominated
by
the
alleged
wrongdoers.
the
corporation
is
not
shown
to
have
any
disability
to
protect
itself
or
to
be
captive.
and
under
those
circumstances,
the
california
rule
is
applied
as
follows,
that
a
--
that
in
the
absence
of
fraud,
bad
faith,
or
domination,
the
directors
of
a
corporation
have
the
right
to
decide
the
questions
involved
in
the
administration
of
that
corporation
including
specifically
the
question
of
whether
to
file
a
particular
lawsuit.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
mr.
williams,
well
i'm
struggling
to
what
you've
just
said
that
the
causes
and
the
diversity
case
that
the
federal
court
is
controlled
by
the
state
law
as
to
what
constitutes
control
under
the
questions
that
arise
in
--
in
state
litigation.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
no,
sir.
i
don't
say
--
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
that's
a
federal
question.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
absolutely.
the
--
the
state
law
has
no
--
the
state
of
california
has
no
authority
to
limit
or
control
the
federal
court
in
determining
its
own
jurisdiction.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
yes.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
yes.
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
this,
not
that
this
court
is
bound
by
california
law
because
that
is
the
last
thing
i
would
suggest.
it
is
this,
that
this
rule,
in
the
application
of
this
rule
in
this
case
is
in
conformity
with
the
substantive
rule
involving
california.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
well,
it
may
be.
it
may
be
and
i
--
i
have
given
it
because
i
thought
it
has
some
reference
to
the
subject
matter.
and
if
i
am
wrong,
well,
i
have
wasted
my
time.
now,
i
know
that
there
are
many
cases
and
they've
been
discussed
in
the
brief
and
i
don't
intend
to
discuss
them.
there
are
many
cases
particularly
in
the
--
in
the
various
courts
of
appeal
and
in
the
district
courts
where
there
is
--
apparent
to
me,
a
great
deal
of
confusion
of
thought
on
the
question
of
--
of
what
is
the
true
rule.
but
we
again
state
and
--
and
this
is
the
very
gist
of
my
argument
that
so
far
as
the
law
now
stands
in
the
united
states,
it
has
been
determined
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
starting
here
with
some
of
the
earlier
cases
or
removal
cases
in
the
ketchum
against
pacific.
it
has
been
the
--
the
basic
proposition
that
parties
will
arraign.
it'd
be
aligned
in
accordance
with
their
real
interest
was
very
fully
covered
in
the
indianapolis
against
chase
national
bank.
and
then,
we
get
down
to
the
specific
cases
and
i
--
i
assert
to
this
court,
the
doctor
against
harrington,
venner
against
the
great
northern
and
koster
against
the
lumbermens
are
the
cases
which
determined
the
law
in
--
in
the
united
states
at
this
time.
and
if
--
if
that
is
not
the
law,
if
it
is
not
the
law
that
in
all
cases
of
stockholders
to
remedy
suits,
the
corporation
will
be
aligned
as
a
plaintiff
because
it
is
the
entity
for
whose
benefit
the
action
is
being
brought,
except
when
it
is
under
disability
to
defend
itself.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
no,
no,
if
it's
a
difference
of
opinion
in
the
absence
of
fraud
or
bad
faith
or
other
disability,
if
it's
a
mere
difference
of
opinion,
the
board
of
directors
have
a
right
to
do
--
to
have
a
--
have
good
judgment
or
a
bad
judgment
in
reference
to
that.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
yes.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
well,
it
goes
to
the
merits
and
to
jurisdiction.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
i
--
i
can't
--
i
can't
see
in
this
case
any
point
of
jurisdiction,
any
question
of
fact
in
connection
with
jurisdiction
that
in
this
particular
case,
doesn't
also
go
to
the
merits.
it
just
happens
because
--
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
yes.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
yes.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
yes,
nothing
more.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
i
say
that
if
you
have
not
that
and
nothing
more,
the
corporation
should
be
aligned
as
a
plaintiff.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
no.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
x
might
owe
$100,000.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
yes.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
in
that
litigation
in
--
in
our
judgment
under
these
authorities.
now,
i
--
i
--
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
i
think
chicago
against
mills
is
very
readily
distinguishable
because
in
chicago
against
mills,
it
was
an
ultra
vires
case
in
which
it
was
claimed
that
the
act
of
the
corporation
was
ultra
vires.
in
all
of
those
ultra
vires
cases,
the
stockholder
has
a
cause
of
action
in
his
own
right
in
which
he
asked
for
a
judgment
against
the
corporation.
to
the
effect
of
this
shall
be
enjoined
from
committing
the
ultra
vires
act.
so
that
the
corporation
is
of
necessity
joined
as
a
party
defendant
because
some
--
some
relief
is
asked
for
against
the
corporation
which
is
not
true
in
the
derivative
case.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
yes.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
that's
correct.
and
in
those
cases
in
my
judgment
are
completely
distinguishable
from
this
case.
now
i
--
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
it
is
a
license
that
harry
warner
and
jack
warner
device
a
scheme
of
causing
the
corporation
to
enter
into
a
contract
with
the
son-in-law
of
harry
warner
by
which
the
son-in-law
would
be
at
risk
in
the
contract
and
the
corporation
would
be
most
of
its
money.
and
--
and
that
they
forced
the
board
of
directors
who
may
dominated
and
controlled
to
approve
that
contract.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
no
difference.
mr.
eugene
d.
williams
i
--
i
think
that
--
i
think
in
this
case,
the
question
of
jurisdiction,
the
question
of
the
right
of
the
stockholder
to
bring
any
action
at
all
as
--
as
set
forth
in
rule
23
(b)
and
the
merits
of
the
case
are
quite
extensive.
now,
i
noticed
from
the
--
it's
last
year
that
i
have
used
the
time
which
i
