mr.
herman
h.
levy
your
honors,
this
case
comes
here
on
certiorari
for
the
ninth
circuit.
in
a
good
many
respects,
this
case
is
similar
to
the
preceding
case.
in
the
swanson
case
or
may
i
--
at
this
point
interrupt
what
i
was
going
to
say
by
answering
judge
--
justice
brennan's
question
directed
to
mr.
doyle
that
in
the
event
a
--
the
directors
of
a
corporation
said
to
a
suing
stockholder,
there's
no
use
of
going
on
with
this
thing.
all
we
can
do
is
try
a
lawsuit
and
if
they
were
--
if
we
get
a
judgment,
it
will
never
be
collected
whether
under
said
circumstances,
the
stockholder
would
be
stating
the
kind
of
a
cause
of
action
that
a
court
of
equity
or
rather
would
--
would
the
situation
be
such
as
to
warrant
the
alignment
of
the
corporation
as
a
defendant.
i
must
disagree
with
mr.
doyle
on
that
and
answer
no
to
that
question.
however
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
that
is
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
that
is
correct,
sir.
however,
if
the
issue
between
the
stockholder
in
that
given
situation
and
the
corporation
with
this,
the
stockholder
says,
“i
don't
agree
with
you.
we
will
collect
this
judgment.
i
know
of
assets
that
this
man
has.”
under
those
circumstances,
there
was
a
real
disagreement
between
the
stockholder
and
this
corporation.
the
corporation
being
definitely
against
the
stockholder,
it
assumes
an
attitude
deliberately
against
him.
and
whatever
the
motives
may
be
of
the
individual
directors
will
make
up
this
directory.
they,
nevertheless,
are
genuinely
oppose
to
the
basic
underlying
issues
that
the
stockholder
races
in
his
charge
of
wrongdoing
against
these
directors.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
that
depends
on
whether
the
plaintiff
has
alleged
in
his
complaint
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
--
wrong.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
well,
i
assumed
that
what
mr.
justice
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
no,
your
honor,
but
i
assume
that
mr.
--
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
assumed
that
the
stockholder
had
alleged
a
series
of
facts
which
indicated
wrongdoing
upon
the
part
of
these
individuals
and
the
directors
took
this
position
and
they
said,
“yes,
i
guess
you're
right.
these
things
are
wrong
but
what's
the
use
of
going
ahead
with
this
thing?
the
corporation
alone
had
spent
a
lot
of
money
and
on
the
line
up,
get
a
judgment
against
the
man
who
has
nothing
and
cannot
collect.”
now,
if
the
stockholder
says,
“well,
the
disagreement
between
you
and
me
is
this,
i
disagree
on
--
on
the
basic
premise
that
you
have
made.”
i
say
this
man
has
a
lot
of
money.
he's
got
it
hidden.
he's
got
it
concealed.
i'll
show
you
how
to
get
it
under.
and
under
those
conditions,
i
say
that
the
--
that
the
--
we
contend
that
the
corporation
should
be
aligned
as
a
defendant
because
there
is
an
adversity
of
interest
to
align
such
a
corporation,
to
align
such
directors
on
the
side
of
the
plaintiff
to
ally
them
with
the
plaintiff.
it
would
create
an
incongruity
of
the
worst
order
because
in
the
first
place,
bare
in
mind
that
the
directors
have
no
controversy
admittedly
with
these
alleged
wrongdoers,
they
say,
“we
have
no
controversy
with
them.”
taking
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
reasoning
in
the
--
in
the
indianapolis
case.
why
--
how
can
you
take
a
--
a
directorate
of
a
corporation
that
says,
in
so
many
words
concededly
and
admittedly,
“we
have
no
quarrel
with
these
defendants.”
we
say
that
what
they
did
was
not
only
proper.
it
was
not
only
right.
it
was
just
and
the
plaintiff
hasn't
got
a
case.
furthermore,
in
this
particular
case,
in
the
warner
matter,
the
defendant
corporation
joined
in
an
answer
with
the
alleged
wrongdoers
and
it
is
conceded
by
counsel
in
that
case
that
the
directors
believed
that
the
conduct
that
the
stockholder
alleges
was
wrongful.
it
was
perfectly
proper
and
just.
and
they
admit
and
the
fact
show
that
the
corporation
participated
in
this
wrongful
conduct
because
here,
it
was
a
contract
made
between
a
corporation,
namely,
warner
brothers
and
harry
warner's
son-in-law.
now,
the
corporate
--
the
stockholder
comes
along
and
says,
“this
was
a
--
a
device
and
a
vehicle
by
which
the
money
was
to
be
siphoned
out
of
the
corporation
into
the
hands
of
the
president's
son-in-law.
now,
these
things
are
not
unusual.
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
court,
the
--
the
statistics
on
the
--
on
--
on
the
questions
are
really
astounding.
here
is
what
the
american
institute
of
management
says
as
late
as
may
14th,
1956,
i'm
quoting
now
from
my
petition
for
certiorari,
your
honors,
on
page
12.
they
say,
“feather-betting
occurs
as
top
level
management
and
extends
down
to
the
rank
performance,”
said
aim
in
the
report
to
its
17,000
members.
and
one
of
the
biggest
causes
of
feather-betting
is
nepotism.
now,
this
is
what
this
case
is
about.
of
course,
nepotism,
the
--
the
real
connotation
probably
applies
to
things
governmental,
but
in
its
latest
connotation,
that
word
has
become
--
has
come
to
be
applied
to
awkward
situations.
in
more
than
--
i
--
i
quote
again
in
more
than
half
of
the
23,000
u.s.
companies,
aim
studied
and
executive
and
put
his
sons,
cousins
and
brothers
even
an
assortment
of
relatives
on
the
payroll.
now,
this
comes
out
of
time
magazine
dated
may
14th,
1956.
i
have
no
reason
to
question
the
authority
of
the
authoritativeness
of
this
statement
as
a
statistic.
now,
in
listening
to
the
arguments
that
have
gone
long
in
this
--
in
--
in
the
swanson
case,
i
--
i
observed,
if
i
may
say
so
state,
a
--
a
confusion.
the
question
in
my
humble
judgment
as
to
whether
diversity
exists
or
does
not
exist
in
any
case,
it
has
been
clearly
stated
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
the
indianapolis
case.
and
we
have
gone
--
we
have
actually,
in
our
brief
applied
the
reasoning
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
the
indianapolis
case
to
the
present
case
and
we
have
said
in
point
two,
i
quote
from
page
22
of
my
brief,
the
warner
directorate
is
a
validly
on
the
defendant
side
of
the
matter
in
controversy.
it
was
error
to
realign
the
corporation
as
a
--
as
a
complainant.
and
using
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
words
in
the
indianapolis
case,
i
said
that
only
if
the
expensive
judicial
integrity,
judicial
integrity,
in
quotes,
may
warner
be
alive
with
the
complainant
in
this
case
in
face
of
directors'
admissions
which
i
test
to
say
the
least
that
they
are
not
on
the
complainant
side
of
the
dispute.
in
face
of
warner
counsels,
that
is
the
corporation
counsels
admission,
that
they
are
not
antagonistic
to
the
step.
they
are
antagonistic
to
the
suit
but
the
corporation
is
at
one
with
the
defendants
in
a
common
contention,
namely,
the
challenge
dealings
in
which
if
the
corporation
and
these
directors
against
whom
we
allege
this
wrongdoing,
again,
in
a
common
contention,
namely,
to
challenge
dealings
which
--
in
which
it
and
they
participate
are
unlawful.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
in
this
case?
mr.
herman
h.
levy
very
well.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
very
well.
i
have
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
no.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
very
well.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
i
have
stated
these
facts,
your
honor,
in
my
statement
of
the
case
beginning
at
page
4
and
continuing
on
until
page
12.
briefly
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
yes.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
in
this
case,
we
have
both
alleged
and,
of
course,
there
was
testimony
in
this
case
as
your
honors.
i
--
i
don't
think
i
have
made
that
thing
clear
and
if
your
honors
haven't
read
my
brief,
maybe
i
should
say
this.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
well,
then
maybe
--
maybe
i
should
--
maybe
i
should
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
well,
then
may
i
--
may
i
state
the
facts
briefly.
our
client
is
a
new
york
citizen
and
a
stockholder
of
warner
brothers
pictures.
he
commenced
this
action
in
the
district
court
in
california
back
in
1948.
he
commenced
it
against
his
corporation,
the
warner
corporation,
harry
and
jack
warner,
the
president
and
vice-president
of
the
company,
harry
warner's
son-in-law,
milton
sperling,
and
another
corporation,
namely,
united,
which
was
owned
by
the
son-in-law.
now,
there
would
have
been
no
question
of
diversity
in
this
case
who
had
it
not
been
for
the
fact
that
warner
corporation,
the
stockholders
company,
is
a
delaware
corporation
and
the
son-in-law's
company
happens
to
be
a
delaware
corporation.
now,
having
joined
as
defendants,
the
stockholders
corporation,
namely,
warner
for
short,
and
united,
the
son-in-law's
corporation,
if
there
--
if
the
corporation
is
realigned,
that
is
the
stockholders
corporation
is
realigned
on
the
side
of
the
plaintiff,
obviously,
diversity
is
lost.
having
done
so,
the
defendants
put
in
an
answer.
now,
the
--
by
the
defendants,
i
mean
the
corporation,
warner,
harry
and
jack
warner,
they
all
appeared
by
the
same
attorneys
and
joined
in
a
common
answer
in
which
they
denied,
(1),
that
the
plaintiff
was
a
citizen
of
new
york,
(2),
they
denied
all
of
the
allegations
of
alleged
wrongdoing
and
breach
of
trust
that
the
complainant
had
alleged
in
this
complaint,
namely,
the
making
of
a
series
of
contracts
and
the
dealings
between
the
warner
corporation
and
the
son-in-law's
corporation
which
the
gist
of
which
was
that
there
was
over
reaching
and
self-dealing,
bringing
about
an
unwarranted
and
unjust
enrichment
in
favor
of
the
son-in-law
and
to
the
detriment
of
the
corporation.
now,
of
course,
this
unjust
enrichment
didn't
stop
merely
with
the
making
of
a
contract
or
with
the
signing
of
a
contract
or
with
the
dealings
of
the
parties
over
a
number
of
years.
and
incidentally,
while
this
action
was
pending,
amendments
were
made
to
this
--
this
contract
and
this
joint
venture
between
the
warner
corporation
and
the
son-in-law's
corporation
was
not
only
continued
but
was
increased
in
scope
from
time
to
time,
more
and
more
pictures
were
added
which
the
son-in-law's
corporation
was
to
produce
and
on
which
he
was
to
get
50%
of
the
profits.
now,
the
--
the
basic
claim
of
the
stockholder
here
is
that
something
was
given
away
to
the
son-in-law
by
a
doting
father-in-law.
now,
that's
the
summon
substance
of
that.
having
taken
the
position,
when
--
when
i
say
having
taken
the
position,
i
mean
by
the
corporation
that
this
was
perfectly
good
and
advantageous
to
the
company,
they
were
going
to
make
a
lot
of
money
and
this
was
--
this
was
good
business
to
do
it.
the
plaintiff
went
on
to
discovery
and
for
a
long
period
of
time,
there
were
--
there
was
a
lot
of
discovery,
admissions,
request
for
admissions
and
depositions
and
interrogatories
to
this
effect.
finally,
we
came
down
to
pretrial.
there
was
no
suggestion
in
the
answer
or
there
was
no
suggestion
up
to
this
time.
now,
this
pretrial
happens
some
two
or
three
years
after
the
action
have
been
commenced
or
maybe
four.
there
was
no
suggestion
up
to
that
time
that
there
was
a
lack
of
diversity
here.
judge
mathes
at
pretrial
questioned
counsel
with
respect
to
that
and
sua
sponte
raised
the
question
which
he
was
entitled
to
do
and
as
the
--
this
court
has
held
that
this
court
can
do
it
all
when
--
when
it
gets
here.
in
other
words,
if
there
was
no
jurisdiction,
there
was
no
jurisdiction
no
matter
how
long
the
case
had
gone
on
and
no
matter
when
it
was
raised
or
no
matter
how
somnolent
and
sleepy
everybody
was
on
the
question
up
to
that.
having
raised
that
question
as
the
findings
show
in
this
case,
the
judge
made
an
order
practically
as
follows
and
i
--
i
stated
in
my
brief
this
way,
the
merits
of
the
controversy,
namely,
whether
the
warner-united
dealings
are
in
fact
unlawful
and
should
be
terminated
and
whether
united
--
warner-united
contract
should
be
ordered
canceled
to
the
extent
that
they
remain
unexecuted
or
not
reach.
the
court
ordered
two
issues
to
be
tried,
namely,
one,
jurisdiction,
and
two,
the
statute
of
limitations.
he
said,
he
should
be
inquired
into
preliminarily
before
we
go
ahead.
let's
see
whether
this
court
has
jurisdiction
before
we
go
on
and
rightfully
so.
the
parties
were
directed
to
present
evidence
and
i
have
this
in
quotes
and
emphasize
only
as
to
those
issues
and
the
findings
go
on
to
say,
“thereupon,
evidence
on
behalf
of
plaintiff
and
defendants,
it
was
offered
and
received
and
the
cause
argued
and
submitted
on
the
two
above
stated
issues
only.”
so
then,
it
is
clear
from
this
finding
that
judge
mathes
was
concerned
primarily
and
only
as
it
turned
out
to
be
with
the
question
of
diversity
jurisdiction
and
even
the
question
of
the
statute
of
limitations
although
considerable
evidence
was
introduced
on
it.
it
was
not
reached.
judge
mathes
held
as
follows
and
this
is
in
concurred
distinction
to
the
holding
in
the
swanson
case.
and
may
i
briefly
summarize
what
i
believe
the
holding
in
the
swanson
case
is
before
ours.
the
holding
in
the
swanson
case
is
that
in
the
absence
of
a
showing,
that
the
law
--
that
the
directorate
was
hostile
to
the
prosecution
of
the
suit,
the
corporation
should
not
be
aligned
as
a
defendant.
now,
that's
the
summon
substance
of
the
holding
in
the
swanson
case.
the
holding
in
our
case,
however,
in
the
--
in
the
sperling
case,
it
goes
beyond
that.
the
court
says,
“that
isn't
enough.”
the
holding
here
is
that
neither
a
showing
that
the
directorate
is
hostile
to
the
prosecution
of
the
suit
nor
a
showing
that
the
directorate
is
antagonistic
to
the
objects
of
the
suit
is
sufficient
to
warrant
the
corporation's
alignment
as
a
defendant.
nothing
short
of
preponderating
proof
that
the
corporation
was
actually
dominated
and
controlled
by
the
co-defendants
can
save
the
corporation
from
being
realigned
as
a
plaintiff.
now,
we
say
that
that
is
not
the
law
and
has
never
been
the
law.
neither
doctor
against
harrington
has
held
that,
nor
has
venner
against
the
great
northern
held
that.
and
while
i'm
on
that
subject,
may
i
--
may
i
say
what
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
no,
your
honor,
i
--
i
--
no,
i
--
i
think
what
judge
mathes
said
virtually
was
this.
he
says,
the
stockholder
is
incumbent
upon
the
stockholder
and
it's
a
prerequisite
to
--
as
right
to
be
heard
in
the
federal
court.
it
is
incumbent
upon
a
stockholder
to
show
that
the
directorate
that
each
and
every
member
of
that
board
of
directors
was
actually
dominated
and
controlled
in
this
case
by
the
president
and
vice-president
that
he
controlled
them.
and
that
they
were
simply,
as
mr.
justice
douglas
in
his
article
in
the
directors
who
do
not
direct
practically,
i
think
called
them
directorial
gigolos
or
something
to
that
effect.
that's
about
the
size
of
it.
that
is
the
holding
of
judge
mathes.
you
have
to
go
that
far.
and
in
my
petition
for
certiorari,
your
honor,
i
have
--
and
i
refer
to
page
13,
i
have
made
this
remark
with
respect
to
that.
admissions
like
the
foregoing
and
i
--
in
a
moment
state
what
these
admissions
were,
admissions
like
the
foregoing
will
fall
short
of
proof
by
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
the
directory
was
dominated
and
controlled
by
the
alleged
wrongdoers
because
as
appellees
successfully
contended
in
the
court
below,
men
who
posses
personal
strength
and
integrity
cannot
be
controlled
by
such
venal
considerations
or
substantial
annual
salaries
from
the
corporation.
in
short,
the
decision
of
the
courts
below
in
essence
is
--
or
in
essence
required
the
stockholder
to
demonstrate
to
an
almost
mathematical
certainty
that
the
ethical
current
in
each
of
his
company's
directors
is
not
adequate
to
overcome,
prompt
this
himself.
and
i
went
on
to
say
a
virtually
impossible
task
and
a
task
which
with
deference
to
the
courts
below
seems
decidedly
out
of
harmony
with
this
court's
recent
observations,
and
i
refer
to
mr.
justice
reeds'
observation
in
koster
against
lumbermens
in
which
he
said
it
has
been
the
whole
course
of
our
law
to
break
down
the
barriers
against
calling
corporations
to
account
in
all
states
where
they're
maybe
doing
business
and
mr.
justice
black's
observation
in
that
same
case
as
follows,
namely,
the
whole
trend
of
recent
congressional
legislation
has
been
to
protect
corporate
stock
and
security
holders.
see
for
example,
securities
act
of
1933.
but
this
legislation
was
not
intended
as
a
complete
substitute
for
the
antidote
by
stockholder
suits
for
the
dangers
inherent
in
the
modern
development
of
frequent
conflicts
between
corporate
owners
and
corporate
managers.
now,
the
factual
background
upon
which
we
make
all
of
these
statements,
your
honors,
is
briefly
stated
in
our
statement
beginning
on
page
6
and
going
on
for
three
or
four
pages.
the
inquiry
that
the
court
had
ordered
into
jurisdiction
in
this
case
unfolded,
as
we
say
the
following
realities,
that
one
of
us
owned
by
the
public.
its
stock
was
distributed
among
some
30,000
stockholders.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
that's
right,
your
honor.
these
are
the
matters
that
came
up
in
evidence
before
judge
mathes
and
the
reason
why
we
stated
or
brought
these
things
out
in
evidence
because
we
were
under
this
impression
and
i
believe
that
we
were
right.
we
took,
as
our
text
say,
this
court's
decision
in
pacific
railroad
against
ketchum
and
in
the
removal
cases
in
which
chief
justice
waite
laid
down
the
following
as
the
rule
to
be
observed.
he
said,
namely,
that
the
district
court
will
"ascertain
the
real
matter
in
dispute
and
arrange
the
parties
on
one
side
or
the
other
of
that
dispute.”
now,
so
that
the
district
court
will
know
what
the
real
matter
in
dispute
is,
we,
the
complainant,
offered
the
following
evidence.
we
--
we
showed
that
the
warner
was
owned
by
the
public
that
30,000
people
owned
this
stock
and
they're
located
all
over
the
world.
that
three
of
the
stockholders,
namely,
harry
and
jack
warner
and
his
brother
albert,
between
them
have
a
working
control
of
the
company.
they
owned
between
15%
and
20%
of
the
stock.
we
showed
by
--
and
these
are
statements
out
of
the
mouths
of
the
directors
and
they
are
stated
on
page
6
and
7
of
our
brief
and
we
showed
that
the
--
that
harry
and
jack
and
albert
warner
run
the
company,
run
in
quotations.
they
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
no,
your
honor,
no.
only
incidentally
am
i
--
am
i
relating
these
things
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter
as
to
what
the
factual
background
is
that
came
out
before
of
mr.
justice
mathes.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
there
was
a
lot
--
when
we
say
--
we
didn't
have
an
18-day
trial
in
the
first
place,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
it
went
on
that
long
and
on
the
second
place
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
oh,
some
15
days
but
we
had
short
sessions
as
well
as
long
sessions
and
--
and
in
during
that
time,
what
we
have
was
this,
your
honor,
we
could
have
all
--
practically
all
of
what,
let's
say
most
of
what
went
into
evidence
in
this
record,
could
have
been
just
--
i
could
have
just
said
i
--
i
offer
an
evidence
of
these
interrogatories
or
i
offer
an
evidence
of
these
requests
for
admissions.
now,
they
were
this
thick
instead
of
that,
we
read
them.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
so
that
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
that's
right.
in
other
words,
i
am
assuming
for
the
sake
of
the
argument
and
is
my
question
--
as
my
question
was
paused
in
this
case.
i
am
assuming
for
the
sake
of
this
argument
that
these
directors
were
not
controlled.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
we're
not
controlled,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
the
warner
directors
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
--
all
of
them.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
that's
right.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
that's
what
the
record
shows.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
he
applied
the
wrong
legal
standards.
now,
i'm
going
beyond
that,
your
honor.
i
say
that
assuming
for
the
sake
of
the
argument,
he
was
--
that
his
findings
were
correct.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
namely,
he
found
that
these
were
--
this
in
--
that
warner
--
that
harry
and
jack
warner
despite
the
fact
that
the
directors
had
testified
that
if
they
became
persona
non
grata
to
harry
and
jack
warner,
they'd
be
through
and
so
they
did
and
that
--
those
are
admissions
in
the
record.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
no,
it
means
they
--
they
had
control.
but
i'm
assuming
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
well,
that's
what
judge
mathes
said.
he
said
he
had
--
they
said
that
these
men
did
--
these
men
were
disinterested
men.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
he
said
--
he
said
that
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
he
didn't
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
may
i
--
may
i
point
this
out,
your
honor.
the
witnesses
that
your
honor
speaks
of
were
several
directors,
only
one
of
which
who
appeared
before
judge
mathes,
the
others,
judge
mathes
never
had
the
benefit
of
seeing
these
people
anymore
than
your
honors
have
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
i
say
it's
unfounded
in
law
because
it's
unfounded
in
fact
but
i
go
on
to
say
further
that
assuming
that
it
is
unfounded
in
law
as
well
as
unfounded
in
fact
and
assuming,
however,
that
he
have
the
right
to
make
such
findings.
i
say,
nevertheless,
i
come
to
this
point
assuming
in
other
words
that
these
directors
were
all
honest
men.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
capable
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
--
capable
of
exercising
their
--
their
good
business
judgment.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
and
in
fact
exercise
and
i
will
go
that
far
and
say
in
fact
exercise.
i
say
this
that
where
a
stockholder
comes
in
and
says,
"you
milked
this
corporation
for
the
benefit
of
this
boy."
the
fact
that
every
one
of
these
men
is
honest
and
has
exercised
to
the
best
of
his
ability,
this
interested
of
an
independent
judgment,
nevertheless,
does
not
argue
for
the
fact
that
these
men
cannot
be
wrong.
i
say
that
the
road
to
a
fraud
maybe
bottomed
down
the
best
of
intentions.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
now,
let
us
assume
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
may
it
please,
your
honor,
mr.
judge
mathes
did
not
find
that
there
was
no
fraud.
what
he
found
was
this.
he
found
that
these
men,
when
they
approve
this
arrangement,
were
not
acting
in
bad
faith.
they
intended
this
to
be
good.
they
considered
this
to
be
good.
the
proposed
findings
and
i
call
your
honors
attention
to
the
record
on
this
point,
the
proposed
findings
on
page
74
of
the
record,
your
honors
will
notice
--
your
honors
will
notice
(voice
overlap).
mr.
herman
h.
levy
these
are
the
findings
that
the
successful
party
proposed
to
judge
mathes.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
and
he
deleted
certain
--
he
deleted
certain
portions
of
the
record
and
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
that's
right.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
now,
these
deletions
of
the
things
that
i
particularly
call
your
honors
attention
to,
your
honor
said
something
a
moment
ago
create
--
made
--
made
a
premise,
namely,
that
judge
mathes
had
found
that
no
fraud
had
been
committed
here.
i
say
that
is
not
the
fact
and
judge
mathes
did
not
find
it
to
be
the
fact.
here
is
what
he
said,
let
us
take
first
what
the
proposal
is
that
judge
mathes
find.
our
opponents
asked
the
court
to
find
that
the
board
of
directors
of
warner
brothers
is
composed
of
11
men
of
whom
the
defendants
harry
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
on
page
74,
your
honor,
of
volume
1.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
but
three,
that
the
contract
in
controversy
was
and
all
amendments
and
supplements
thereto
were
and
are
sound
business
arrangements
made
and
entered
in
good
faith
and
without
fraud.
now,
what
judge
mathes
did
was
struck
out,
the
ultimate
fact.
he
did
not
find
that
these
contracts
were
honest
and
without
fraud.
he
said
they
were
intended
to
be.
they
were
intended
by
the
directors
to
be
a
--
a
benefit
to
the
company
and
the
directors
considered
them.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
that's
right.
he
says
under
the
--
under
the
record
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
well,
because
he
--
what
he
says
there,
your
honor,
he
didn't
say,
"i
examined
this
whole
situation
and
i
find
that
this
son-in-law
wasn't
--
wasn't
treated
--
wasn't
treated
with
--
with
favor.”
he
says
this,
“the
directors
examined
this
thing
and
they
came
to
the
conclusion
in
their
opinion
that
this
was
all
right.”
but
i
don't
say
it's
all
right.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
he
could
be
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
that's
right.
that
isn't
the
finding
in
my
humble
judgment
that
that
contract
is
not
fraudulent.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
well,
it
means
this,
your
honor.
it
means
that
these
directors
when
this
contract
was
placed
before
them
and
they
said,
“very
well,
we'll
pass
on
this.”
and
at
the
time
they
did,
they
didn't
intend
to
hurt
the
company.
they
weren't
out
to
hurt
the
company.
that's
all
but
it
is
a
far
cry
from
the
director
saying
--
from
saying
that
the
directors
were
honest
men
and
they
didn't
intend
to
hurt
the
company
to
saying
that
what
actually
was
contained
in
that
contract
and
the
dealings
under
that
contract
between
these
two
corporations
were
not,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
unwarrantedly
favorable
to
a
son-in-law
and
did
not,
in
fact,
militate
in
the
direction
of
siphoning
a
--
a
part
of
warner's
capital
into
the
coffers
of
a
--
of
a
favorite
boy.
it's
quite
a
different
thing
and
the
fact
that
judge
mathes
was
careful
enough
to
x
this
out
is
another
indication
of
the
fact.
and
furthermore
may
i
say
this,
your
honor,
another
evidence
of
the
fact
that
judge
mathes
didn't
find
that
there
was
actual
fraud
here
in
the
sense
these
--
whether
these
dealings
were
actually
closure
or
not,
let
me
put
it
that
way,
is
this.
had
he
done
so,
he
would
have
assumed
jurisdiction.
he
says,
he
never
assumed
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
he
says
he
never
tried
the
merits
in
this
case.
he
ordered
the
parties
not
to
present
evidence
on
the
merits
in
this
case.
he
confined
and
limited
the
issue,
the
hearing
to
questions
involving
whether
--
involving
what
whether
or
not
there
was
diversity
in
this
case.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
what
--
pardon
me?
mr.
herman
h.
levy
that's
right.
the
question
before
judge
mathes
was
simply
this,
have
i
or
have
i
not
the
power
to
examine
into
the
merits
of
this
thing
and
determine
whether
this
was
an
honest
deal
or
was
not
an
honest
deal.
first
of
all,
i'm
going
to
determine
whether
i
have
the
power
as
the
federal
court
does.
now,
what
he
meant,
he
makes
these
findings
and
he
says
this,
before
i
can
have
the
power
to
decide
this
case,
the
stockholder
must
show
me
not
only
that
the
directors
are
hostile
to
him,
not
only
that
they
are
antagonistic
to
him
in
anyway,
unless
he
shows
and
by
preponderating
evidence
that
each
and
everyone
of
these
men
were
--
was
dominated
and
controlled
by
the
three
warner
brothers
so
that
they
were
not
free
agents.
i
cannot
decide
this
case
because
then
the
corporation
must
be
aligned
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
and
notwithstanding
the
fact
--
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
corporation
has
taken
the
position
and
concedes
it
contrary
to
the
stockholders
notwithstanding
any
of
such
things
all
together.
now,
we
say
that
that
is
not
the
law
in
this
case,
neither
doctor
against
harrington
has
held
that,
neither
venner
against
the
great
northern
hasn't
held
that.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
the
rule
of
alignment?
mr.
herman
h.
levy
that
where
a
stockholder
can
show
or
show
us
whether
it
is
pleadings
or
by
affidavit
or
by
evidence
taken
orally
that
the
corporation,
his
corporation,
the
stockholder's
corporation
is
hostile,
is
inimical
to
the
objects
of
the
suit
under
those
conditions,
the
corporation
has
to
be
aligned
as
a
defendant
where
he
cannot
show
that
the
corporation
is
hostile,
not
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
--
to
the
best
interest
of
the
corporation
as
--
as
judge
mathes
held.
what
judge
mathes
held
here
is
this,
it
isn't
enough
for
the
stockholder
to
show
that
the
corporation
was
hostile
to
him
or
that
the
directors
were
hostile.
he
must
show
that
they
were
hostile
not
to
him
or
to
the
commencement
of
the
action
or
to
its
object.
he
must
show
that
they
are
hostile
to
the
best
interest
of
the
corporation.
now
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
--
i
contend
this,
your
honor
if
that's
the
situation,
how
can
he
do
that
unless
he
tries
the
merits
as
the
chief
justice
suggested
to
one
of
the
gentlemen
who
argued
the
case
before
this?
how
can
he
do
this
unless
he
tries
all
the
merits?
now,
if
that
were
the
rule,
what
will
happen?
judge
mathes
would
have
gone
along
and
tried
the
merits
of
the
controversy.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
that's
right.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
yes,
except
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
i
--
i
disagreed
with
it
for
this
reason.
i
didn't
--
it
-
it
struck
me
that
a
mere
disagreement
between
a
stockholder
and
the
directors
of
a
corporation
that
has
no
real
basis
are
just
--
a
disagreement
with
stockholders
as
i
think
you
ought
to
bring
this
thing
and
the
--
and
the
directors
say,
"we
don't
think
you
all
agreed.
you
haven't
showed
us
why."
there's
no
reason
for
it
at
all
and
the
stockholders
simply
remained
quiet
about
it
and
it's
just
--
just
arbitrary
and
capricious
about
it.
that's
no
reason.
i
mean
i
don't
think
that
that
would
establish
diversity
because
he
hasn't
shown
that
the
corporation
is
antagonistic,
is
hostile
to
what
he
claim
is
right,
unless
the
--
when
the
stockholder
comes
into
court
and
he
says,
"look,
here
is
a
series
of
acts
that
were
done.
these
things
i
say
are
wrong.
they
are
evil."
the
corporate
director
say,
"oh,
no,
we
regard
these
things
as
good
and
rightful."
you
have
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out
to
be
inevitable.
you
have
a
situation
where
one
side
says,
“yes”
and
the
other
side
says,
“no.”
in
this
case,
we
have
this
situation.
here
is
the
warner
outfit,
the
corporation,
being
aligned
with
the
complainant
against
the
directors
of
the
company,
the
--
the
president
and
vice-president
when
the
corporation
has
no
dispute
at
all
with
them.
now,
as
a
matter
if
we
go
one
step
further
and
as
i
say
in
my
second
point
adopting
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
language
to
this
situation,
we
point
out
that
only
at
the
expense
we
say
of
judicial
integrity
can
this
be
done
in
this
case
for
these
reasons.
i
put
it
this
way.
the
error
of
both
courts
in
realigning
warner
corporation
as
a
complainant,
thus
destroying
diversity
becomes
clear.
when
this
court's
language
in
indianapolis
has
adopted
to
the
realities
and
that's
the
thing
that
we
talked
about
in
--
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
talked
about
in
indianapolis,
the
realities
of
the
present
case
and
it
is
seemed
that
the
question
which
permeates
this
litigation
is,
"should
the
court
terminate
and
cancel
the
warner-united
arrangement
as
unlawful
and
unfair
to
warner
and
compel
the
defendants
--
the
co-defendants
to
account
for
the
injuries
they
--
they
were
alleged
to?”
of
course,
we
asked
and
our
answer
that
the
court
halt
this
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
yes,
sir.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
that's
what
the
court
in
doctor
against
harrington
said.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
yes,
your
honor.
i
say
that
it
happened
here
even
though
mr.
--
even
though
judge
mathes
found
that
in
his
opinion.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
that's
right.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
both
i
think,
your
honor.
and
in
the
next
place,
i
go
one
step
further
and
i
say,
he
assumed
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
well,
then
maybe
i
misunderstood
your
honor's
question.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
yes.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
there
is
not.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
he
found
that
when
he
applied
the
wrong
rule
of
law.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
yes,
your
honor.
he
says
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
he
--
he
excluded
it
from
his
findings.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
no,
he
didn't
find
one
or
another,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
no,
he
said
nothing
of
the
kind.
he
simply
confined
these
findings
to
one
thing.
it
was
because
he
was
under
this
impression
that
before
a
corporation
can
be
realigned
as
a
complainant
in
a
stockholder
suit,
the
stockholder
must
show
that
the
--
the
directors
were
dominated
in
control
and
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
he
found
that
they
were
not
under
the
domination
and
control
of
the
three
brothers.
oh,
yes,
he
found
that.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
no,
your
honor.
doctor
and
harrington
--
may
i
say
this,
doctor
and
harrington
was
not
decided
on
that
issue
at
all.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
may
i
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
may
i
--
may
i
respectfully
call
your
honors
attention
to
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
yes,
your
honor.
and
may
i
point
out
that
if
doctor,
and
--
and
i
say
this
advice,
that
after
reading
a
lot
of
law
on
this
thing,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
in
the
doctor
and
harrington
case,
i'll
go
so
far
as
to
say
this,
if
there
had
been
no
allegation
in
the
complaint
in
the
doctor
and
harrington
case
of
domination
and
control
by
the
defendants,
by
the
co-defendants
of
--
of
the
corporation
under
the
stockholder,
that
complaint
would
--
the
diversity
would
still
be
present
in
doctor
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
--
against
harrington.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
may
i
call
your
honors
attention
to
this
though.
here
is
what
--
here
is
--
here's
the
language
of
the
court
on
this
thing,
it
says
the
94th
rule
in
equity
contemplates
that
there
may
be
and
provides
for
a
suit
by
a
stockholder
in
a
corporation
founded
on
rights
which
maybe
properly
asserted
by
the
corporation.
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
established
that
such
a
suit
when
between
citizens
of
different
states
involves
a
controversy
cognizable
in
a
--
in
a
court
of
the
united
states.
the
ultimate
interest
of
a
corporation
maybe
--
may
defendant
maybe
the
same
as
that
may
plaintiff
--
plaintiff
of
the
corporation
maybe
under
a
control
antagonistic
to
him
on
how
the
--
what
is
the
semantic
meaning
of
the
word
antagonistic
doesn't
mean
antagonistic
of
the
corporation
ultimate
interest
which
require
a
trial
of
the
merits
in
order
to
determine.
and
after
you
get
a
trial
of
the
merits,
what
happens?
the
judge
says,
"i
have
found
that
the
plaintiff
hasn't
got
a
case
but
i
cannot
decide
it
because
i
have
no
jurisdiction."
that's
what
it
will
amount
to.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
may
i
say
that
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
mr.
justice
black
asked
the
question
whether
there
had
been
a
complete
trial
on
the
merits.
may
i
quote
in
this
part?
i
refer
the
court
to
page
572,
first
of
the
record
in
which
i
say,
"i
am
just
wondering,
your
honor,
the
reason
why
--
the
reason
why
i
say
there
maybe
some
occasion
is
this.
we
are
trying,
as
i
understand,
limited
issues
here
now
and
this
applies
to
both
this
witness
and
the
witness,
mr.
friedman
who
preceded
him
and
so
forth."
and
the
court
says,
"mr.
levy,
you
may
need
them
tomorrow,"
meaning,
the
witnesses
that
we
were
talking
about.
“i
will
ask
them
to
remain
until
tomorrow.
i
hope
we
can
reach
a
conclusion
of
the
evidence
tomorrow
on
this
matter.”
mr.
levy,
“on
the
issues
that
we
are
trying
now,
your
honor?
the
court,
"on
the
issues,
yes.
on
the
issue
as
to
jurisdiction
and
the
issue
as
to
the
statute
of
limitations.”
now,
on
page
583
of
the
record,
the
court
says,
"do
both
sides
rest
on
the
issues
as
to
jurisdiction
latches
or
limitation?"
mr.
williams,
"yes,
your
honor."
mr.
levy,
"yes,
your
honor."
the
court,
"if
we
take
up
the
case
further
on
the
merits,
it
will
be
some
time
--
it
would
be
some
time
in
july,
the
last
half
of
july
or
in
the
fall."
now,
if
that
isn't
in
itself
sufficient,
we
go
to
page
586
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
583,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
no,
your
honor,
he
need
not.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
all
that
he
need
do
is
this.
the
court
--
mr.
chief
justice,
wait,
laid
down
the
rule
way
back
in
pacific
railroad
against
ketchum
that
when
a
question
of
jurisdiction
arises
at
the
threshold,
then
it
should
arise
right
at
the
threshold.
the
court
will
look
into
the
matter
and
determine
what
kind
of
a
case
is
this.
let's
see
what
this
is
about
and
the
next
thing
that
he
must
do
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
no.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
no,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
that's
right.
in
other
words,
the
court
does
not
adjudicate
at
that
point
whether
he
has
the
power
to
hear
and
determine
as
a
federal
court
what
this
case
is
all
about
and
to
decide
either
in
the
plaintiff
--
for
the
plaintiff
or
for
the
defendant.
all
he
has
called
upon
to
do
under
chief
justice
waite's
rule
was
this.
let
me
see
what
this
case
is
about
and
then
let
me
see
who
belongs
on
one
side
and
who
belongs
on
the
other
side.
who
says
this
and
who
says
that.
now,
according
to
your
own
--
to
your
honor's
own
rule
laid
down
in
indianapolis
case.
you
said
that
in
that
case
that
chase
and
in
the
--
in
indianapolis
were
partners
in
litigation.
now,
the
facts
in
this
case
even
under
these
findings
show
that
these
two
people
--
that
is
the
--
the
warner
brothers,
the
individual
defendants
and
the
corporation
here
were
partners
in
litigation.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
no,
sir.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
no,
sir.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
at
all.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
yes,
sir.
and
the
court
so
held
in
this
case.
whatever
we
found
here
is
not
on
the
merits
and
he
--
he
had
it
in
his
opinion.of
course,
if
the
complainant
in
this
case
has
to
go
to
the
state
court,
he'll
certainly
will
--
and
never
practically
won't
prevail
if
the
statute
of
limitation
is
going
to
be
a
--
become
a
bar
to
them.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
no,
sir.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
absolutely
not.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
he
couldn't.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
no,
sir.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
yes,
sir.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
yes,
your
honor.
and
i'll
give
your
honor
and
an
answer
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question,
the
test
--
your
honor
asked
me
that
yesterday
and
the
test
has
been
very,
very
nicely
and
i
believe
adequately
and
justly
stated
by
judge
lanning
in
new
jersey
in
the
case
of
groel
against
the
electric
company.
he
said
this.
and
may
i
read
from
the
21
of
my
brief?
the
groel
case
suit
problem
--
this
is
my
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals,
your
honors.
the
groel
case
suit
problem
was
decided
some
25
years
after
the
removal
cases.
in
that
case,
the
complainant
stopped
although
a
citizen
of
new
jersey
had
instituted
a
derivative
suit
in
the
new
jersey
court
of
chancery,
the
defendant's
name
with
his
corporation,
a
new
jersey
company
and
the
pennsylvania
corporation.
the
case
had
been
removed
from
the
state
court
to
the
federal
district
court
of
new
jersey.
plaintiff
stopped
all
the
move
to
remand
on
the
ground
that
both
he
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
--
and
the
defendant,
new
jersey
corporation
were
citizens
of
new
jersey.
in
our
position
to
the
motion,
it
was
contended
that
since
the
stockholder
was
urging,
not
his,
but
to
the
corporation's
cause
of
action
which
has
been
the
contention
throughout
here,
but
that
is
controlling.
the
federal
court
should
view
the
stockholder's
corporation
as
a
plaintiff
and
realign
it
with
the
complainant,
thus
bringing
about
diversity.
the
court
declines
to
do
so
and
said
on
page
263,
quote,
"this
contention
has
seem
to
necessitate
before
going
to
review
of
the
authorities
and
judge
lanning
really
made
a
review
of
the
authorities."
the
rule
deduced
from
them
is
that,
in
astute
in
equity
instituted
by
a
stockholder
in
his
own
name,
but
upon
a
right
of
action
existing
in
his
corporation,
the
stockholder's
corporation
will
be
aligned
with
the
defendant's
whenever
the
officers
or
persons
controlling
the
corporation
are
shown
to
be
opposed
to
the
object
sought
by
the
complaining
stockholder.
and
that
when
such
opposition
does
not
appear,
the
stockholder's
corporation
will
be
aligned
with
the
complainant
in
the
suit,
and
this
case
was
cited
with
approval
in
venner
against
the
great
northern.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
no,
your
honor.
i
do
not.
when
we
say
what
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
may
i
explain
it
then,
your
honor?
mr.
herman
h.
levy
judge
lanning
meant
this.
he
says
when
the
corporation
--
when
the
directorate
of
a
corporation
evinces
and
makes
evident
an
attitude
that
is
opposed
not
to
the
stockholder,
because
he
wears
a
red
tie
for
example,
nothing
personal
about
it.
but
when
it
is
opposed
to
what
he
stands
in
court
and
condense
for,
when
the
directorate
of
the
corporation
is
opposed
to
that,
then
it
--
the
corporation,
the
--
this
directorate
is
antagonistic
to
the
--
to
the
--
to
the
stockholder's
claim.
and
the
corporation
is
in
antagonistic
hands
because
the
point
is
this,
that
in
this
case,
the
directors
were
unanimous.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
in
any
case.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
does
your
honor's
premise
carry
this
--
carry
this
thought
as
well
that
the
corporation
virtually
says,
"you
may
have
a
point
there.”
this
man
--
this
corporation
may
be
entitled
to
get
this
money,
but
we
think
that
even
though
it's
entitled
to
get
this
money,
we
don't
feel
that
it's
advisable
to
go
ahead
and
sue
because
you
may
not
win.
now,
i
think
that
under
those
circumstances,
your
honor,
the
corporation
should
be
aligned
as
a
defendant
for
the
reason
that
the
directorate
is
enhanced
that
is
in
opposition
or
inimical
to
the
objects
of
the
stockholder's
action
which
he
prepared
--
which
he
is
prepared
to
bring.
now
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
in
one
case,
yes,
and
in
one
case
not.
now,
i'll
tell,
your
honor,
in
which
case,
yes,
and
in
which
case,
not.
if
the
corporation
has
a
claim,
if
the
stockholder's
claim
is
this,
the
corporation
has
a
claim
against
the
stranger,
the
case
that
you
put,
your
honor,
put
to
mr.
schwab.
in
other
words,
the
corporate
--
the
--
the
stockholder
says,
“this
corporate
--
this
stranger
owes
this
corporation
a
$100,000.00.”
and
the
directorate
says,
"well,
no."
or
maybe
--
well,
maybe
he
does
and
maybe
he
doesn't.
we
don't
think
it's
advisable
to
go
ahead.
i
say
that
under
those
circumstances,
the
stockholder
hasn't
even
got
a
case
for
this
reason,
for
this
reason
because
this
is
a
--
a
claim
of
the
corporation
against
the
stranger
and
the
directorate
can
do
what
it
pleases
about.
in
other
words,
improvidence
in
such
a
situation
makes
no
difference
and
doesn't
give
the
stockholder
the
right
to
come
into
court.
but
those
cases
are
distinguishable
clearly
as
mr.
justice
douglas
has
pointed
out
in
pepper
against
litton
from
the
case
in
which
a
contract
is
involved
between
the
corporation
and
its
president
or
his
wife
or
his
son-in-law
and
the
case
of
--
the
wife
was
clearly
stated
by
one
of
the
vice
chancellors
in
breweries
against
nixon
in
new
jersey.
that
is
a
different
situation.
in
those
cases,
the
business
judgment
rule
must
yield
to
the
greater
rule
of
undivided
loyalty
as
mr.
justice
douglas
has
pointed
out
in
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
say
that.
now,
that
--
that
would
be
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
i
say
that
where
a
corporation
is
engaged
in
a
deal
with
a
son-in-law
of
the
president,
and
that
deal
has
been
arranged
by
his
father-in-law,
the
president
of
the
company
with
him
and
a
stockholder
comes
along
and
says,
"this
is
a
vehicle
by
which

corporate
money
into
the
hands
of
the
son-in-law."
i
say
under
those
circumstances,
the
court
is
not
bound
by
the
business
judgment
rule
but
all
the
decisions
are
to
the
effect
that
the
--
a
court
of
equity
will
scrutinize
the
contract
carefully
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
it
was
in
its
last
analysis
fair
or
unfair,
irrespective
of
whether
the
board
of
directors
thought
it
was
fair,
irrespective
of
whether
they
were
honest
men
because
even
honest
men
may
differ,
may
be
capable
of
using
--
thinking
that
something
is
fair
which
isn't
because
i'll
give
your
honor
the
simple
example.
suppose
the
board
of
directors
is
composed
of
men
who
are
perfectly
honest
and
perfectly
fair,
they
believe
that
this
president
of
a
corporation
should
get
a
million
dollars
a
year.
now,
they
say
in
our
--
we
are
--
business
judgment
rule
is
exercised
right
then
as
to
right
now,
and
the
stockholder
comes
along
and
says,
"oh,
no.
this
is
just
ridiculous.
this
is
unreasonable."
shall
we
say
that
under
those
circumstances,
the
stockholder
is
out,
out
in
the
state
court
or
out
in
a
federal
court?
mr.
herman
h.
levy
yes,
sir.
mr.
herman
h.
levy
no,
sir.
it
has
not.
and
may
i
make
one
request,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
brief
who
served
my
opponent's
brief,
who
served
on
me
the
day
before
i
am
trained
for
washington,
from
california
and
i've
had
absolutely
no
opportunity
of
course
to
reply.
may
i
file
--
may
i
just
file
with
the
court
my
brief
in
the
court
--
in
the
court
of
appeals
which
contains
the
latest
law
of
the
state
--
of
the
state
of
california
on
the
question
not
the
one
cited
by
my
opponent
namely
finley
against
gareth,
but
the
later
case
unless
your
honors
want
to
take
it
down,
the
case
of
kennerson
against
burbank
120
cal.ap.california
appeals
157
--
170
in
which
the
law
of
california
is
stated
to
be
clearly
the
law
as
stated
by
mr.
justice
douglas
in
pepper
against
litton
are
no
different.
may
i
--
mr.
herman
h.
levy
--
please
file
it?
mr.
herman
h.
levy
thank
you,
your
honors.
