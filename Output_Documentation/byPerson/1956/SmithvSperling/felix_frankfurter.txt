mr.
levy,
may
i
interrupt
you
to
just
summarize
the
material
on
the
basis
of
which
the
criteria
in
which
you
have
invoked
is
to
be
determined.
what
are
facts
in
short
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
interpolate
in
the
bite
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
the
facts
in
this
case
which
are
before
us?
i
assume
there's
no
such
controversy
in
this
case
as
in
the
prior
one
as
to
what
facts
are
really
before
us
so
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
think
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
then
what
are
the
facts
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
i
take
it
your
brother
will
agree
with
or
with
the
usual
differences
of
counsel
in
stating
the
facts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
the
sources?
its
complaint
is
just
state
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
all
the
sources
on
which
you
--
from
which
the
facts
arrived
on
which
we
must
act
on
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
one
of
these
judges
who
doesn't
read
the
briefs
as
it
does.
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
deal
any
such
compulsion
and
i
have
good
reason
for
not
doing
it
myself
whatever
or
anybody
else's
reason
for
himself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
turning
on
giving
us
all
--
it
came
out
on
evidence
after
judge
mathes
put
this
question
--
these
issues,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
we're
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
directors?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
i
understood
your
argument,
i
may
have
hoped
they
must
concede
it,
you
persuaded
me
if
what
you
said
was
so
that
the
warner
brothers
with
a
15%
to
20%
working
interest
controlled
in
the
sense
determined
what
that
corporation
would
or
wouldn't
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
that's
what
the
record
shows
that
having
that
control
determining
what
the
corporation
which
they
control
can
--
would
or
would
not
do
by
their
ipse
dixit
that
in
fact
these
stockholders
said,
“you
are
milking
the
corporation
in
what
i
have
a
monetary
interest
by
giving
favors
by
trigging
the
outside
and
the
way
in
which
you
shouldn't
be
treated
if
you
merely
regard
the
corporate
interest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
what
you
said?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
that
being
so,
your
argument
i
think
it
is
that
judge
mathes
applied
the
wrong
legal
doctrine
as
justice
whittaker
suggests,
applied
the
wrong
legal
standard
for
determining
when
you
transfer
a
nominal
plaintiff
over
to
the
defendant's
side.
isn't
that
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
does
that
mean
that
--
that
what
you
said
that
this
15%-20%
warners
did
not
have
control?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
they
had
control,
then
judge
--
then
--
then,
how
can
the
fellows
saying
that
the
fellow
has
control
hasn't
got
control?
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
he
must
have
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
he
must
have
rejected
the
conclusion
which
you
and
i
under
your
inference
have
drawn
from
this
testimony
and
hear
the
witnesses,
then
you're
up
against
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
justice
whittaker's
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
what's
challenging
as
justice
whittaker
suggested
to
you
a
minute
ago,
you
say
that
the
conclusion
which
he
arrived
at
is
unfounded
in
law
because
it's
unfounded
in
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
capable
of
exercising
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
their
honesty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
you
just
negative
our
right
to
conclude
that
judge
mathes
was
wrong
or
unjustified
on
the
record
in
finding
there
was
no
fraud.
if
there
was
fraud,
then
we
got
no
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
mean
by
proposed
findings?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
made
them
as
amended?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
isn't
what
he
actually
found.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
bottom
of
the
page
--
bottom
words.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
he
--
he's
very
categorical
in
saying
--
in
signing
his
name
to
a
finding
that
the
contract
in
question,
in
controversy
was
made
and
entered
into
in
good
faith
and
without
fraud.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
weren't
--
on
the
finding,
there
was
no
fraud.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
--
between
what
says.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
why
do
you
paraphrase?
he
says,
the
contract
in
controversy
was
made
and
entered
into
in
good
faith
and
without
fraud.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
levy
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
do
you
conceived
of
a
corporation
as
having
an
external
existence
apart
from
those
who
control
its
fate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
because
--
that's
--
doctor
and
harrington
was
the
case
where
the
harrington
has
a
corporation
by
the
throat.
they
were
the
corporation
for
purpose
of
that
transaction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
may
have
happened
here,
but
then
you
have
to
say
that
the
findings
of
judge
mathes
to
the
contrary
or
to
the
outset,
although
he
found
that
as
a
fact,
he
drew
the
wrong
inference
from
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
go
that
part
to
that
point,
you
don't
have
to
go
any
further.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
know
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
say
that
judge
mathes
--
does
it
appear
from
the
finding,
the
first
one,
does
it
appear
from
the
finding
that
the
people
who
control
the
fate
of
warner
brothers
as
a
corporation
exercise
an
honest,
non-fraudulent
judgment?
is
that
a
finding
of
it?
if
you
challenge
that
as
a
finding,
then
--
then
my
next
question
isn't
going
to
be
what
it
is.
but
if
you
say
that's
what
he
found
and
that's
as
i
read
it,
then
the
next
question
is,
is
that
a
baseless
finding?
is
there
no
evidence
in
this
record
which
justify
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well,
i
can
understand
that
and
--
or
you
can
say,
“yes,
he
found
that
but
he
applied
the
wrong
rule
of
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
did
he
find
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
mean
he
excluded
it?
did
you
mean
he
found
the
opposite?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
irrelevant?
did
he
say
it
was
irrelevant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
we
can't
find
unless
we
find
that
that
finding
is
based
that
they
were
under
control
and
that's
doctor
and
harrington.
justice
felix
frankfurter
doctor
and
harrington
were
decided
on
a
simple
plain
stock
issue
that
the
dominant
control
of
that
corporation
did
something
in
their
self-interest
and
thereby
deprived
the
doctors
of
their
right
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
doctor
and
harrington
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
of
the
charge
of
doctor
and
harrington
among
others
is
the
--
the
brief
opinion,
so
we
can
read
it
very
quickly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
it
would
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
the
whole
point
of
doctor
and
harrington
was
that
a
certificate
came
up
here
from
judge
lacombe
of
the
circuit
court
in
the
southern
district
asking
this
specific
question
and
not
aligning
it
and
this
court
said
that
--
and
aligning
it
with
the
plaintiff,
this
court
said,
“no”,
because
the
people
who
actually
has
the
corporation
there
by
the
throat
were
the
fellows
against
whom
you
complained.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
suggesting
that
in
this
kind
of
a
case,
if
a
--
if
a
stockholder
brings
suit
and
on
behalf
of
the
corporation
against
a
third
person
on
the
--
because
the
directors
will
not
bring
suit
because
they
might
have
thought
--
on
a
claim
that
he
alleges
the
corporation
pass.
and
he
further
alleges
that
he
won't
bring
suit,
that
directors
won't
bring
suit
because
the
debtor,
the
potential
debtor
is
a
great
friend
of
the
majority
of
the
directors
and
they
don't
want
to
bring
suit
against
him
which
might
put
him
in
a
bad
public
life.
is
it
your
suggestion
that
on
the
question
of
jurisdiction
being
raised
i.e.
they're
preventing
the
corporation
from
suing,
the
corporation
would
have
to
be
a
necessary
party
on
one
side
or
the
other
in
such
a
suit,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
on
the
question,
whether
it
should
be
on
the
plaintiff's
side
or
the
defendant's
side,
is
it
your
suggestion
that
the
merits
of
the
claim
that
is
pressed
must
also
be
decided
before
you
can
decide
the
jurisdictional
question
as
to
what
the
real
conflict
is
between
the
parties?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
not
saying
about
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suggest
that
the
word
"antagonistic"
isn't
that
illuminating
description.
the
word
"disabled"
used
in
the
cost-cutting
case
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
means
something.
justice
felix
frankfurter
antagonistic
gets
you
into
other
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
a
totally
different
area.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
if
it
isn't
disabled,
then
the
corporation
must
be
the
plaintiff?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
--
why
was
the
evidence
as
to
--
of
some
directors
by
way
of
deposition
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
stipulation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
directors
were?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
their
holding
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
their
holding
to
the
total
stock?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
just
--
suppose
the
california
supreme
court
ruled
as
a
matter
of
law
that
15%
of
stockholding
isn't
enough
to
give
you
control.
would
that
determine
the
question
of
realigning
the
party?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
federal
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
question
of
--
in
my
point
of
view,
essentially
a
question
of
fact
to
be
determined
by
the
district
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
california
or
any
other
state
law
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
california
law
comes
into
play
after
the
--
if
diversity
is
established
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
you
go
to
the
merits
of
a
suit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
why
do
you
have
to
so?
it's
simply
confusing
if
i
may
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
know
of
this
particular
case,
if
a
stockholder
says
that
x
owns
a
corporation,
$100,000.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
stockholder
writes
to
the
corporation,
“will
you
please
sue
x
for
$100,000?”
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
--
the
secretary
of
the
corporation
or
their
lawyer
writes
to
the
stockholder.
“he
ought
to
have
the
47th
receipt
and
i'm
ought
--
i'm
instructed
to
inform
you
the
corporation
has
decided
not
to
bring
suit
against
x.”
suppose
you
have
that,
nothing
more.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
would
you
do
in
that
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
has
nothing
to
do
whether
indeed
x
owes
a
$100,000
to
the
corporation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
he
might
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
has
nothing
to
do
where
you
put
the
corporation
in
that
litigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
way
the
income
tax
case
was
--
and
later
on
the
federal
law
and
the
corporation
is
asked.
if
the
stockholder
says
that
you
mustn't
pay
this
tax,
not
that
i'm
enforcing
some
claim
that
you
have.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
the
claim
that
i
had
against
you
not
will
be
guilty
of
devastated
of
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
your
view,
mr.
levy
that
when
a
court
in
a
--
in
this
kind
of
a
diversity
case
that's
confronted
with
the
problem
appropriately
raised
as
to
the
side
on
which
the
corporation
whose
claim
is
being
pressed
by
a
stockholder?
when
the
district
court
is
confronted
with
that
question,
must
we
go
to
the
merits
of
the
corporate
claim
which
the
stockholder
is
seeking
to
enforce?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
what
is
the
point
of
what
you're
now
stating?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
merely
as
to
pursue
that
the
court
has
to
adjudicate
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
whether
or
not
there
is
a
claim?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
can
--
that's
what
to
me,
means
the
term
--
the
merits
mean.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
adjudicating
the
question
whether
ultimately
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
these
defendants
were
fraudulent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
fact
that
the
statute
of
limitations
might
have
run
because
you
chose
--
because
a
litigant
chooses
to
go
to
the
federal
court,
there's
no
reason
for
finding
their
federal
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
to
say
that
if
the
rule
that
you're
offering,
that
whenever
a
--
whenever
a
stockholder
seeks
to
enforce
a
claim
which
runs
to
the
corporation
in
his
view
and
he
asked
the
corporation
to
sue
and
the
corporation
said,
"we're
very
sorry.
we
do
not
think
it
is
desirable
to
sue.
we
do
not
think
we
can
win
in
this
case.
yours
truly."
that
at
once
aligned
him
with
the
defendant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
understand
what
--
the
reading
of
that
is
opposed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
certainly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
this
case.
i
want
a
proof.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
there
plaintiffs
stockholders,
right?so,
there,
in
courteous
letter
and
encloses
a
very
strong
opinion
from
his
lawyer
saying,
"i've
studied
the
authority
and
i
think
the
corporation
has
a
good
cause
of
action."
and
that
is
sent
to
the
secretary
to
whom
service
is
sent
of
corporation
x.
and
corporation
x
sends
that
on
to
its
general
counsel
and
the
general
counsel
send
back
an
opinion
saying,
"i
think
the
opinion
of
my
respected
brother
at
the
bar
is
--
is
not
in
all
that,
but
i
think
he
has
overlooked
some
recent
tendency,
the
supreme
court
decisions.
i
think
the
chances
of
recovery
are
very
remote.
this
will
be
a
long
going
out
litigation.
it
will
cost
a
lot
of
money
and
incidentally
arouse
friction
and
i
recommend
that
the
corporation
do
not
make
that
claim
and
bring
proceeding
--
does
that
on
opposition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
corporation
in
other
words
isn't
entitled
to
act
in
good
faith
on
the
advise
of
its
counsel.
it
must
take
the
advice
or
plaintiff's
counsel
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he's
exercising
a
--
an
exercising
a
business
judgment
by
the
corporation
is
proved
disloyal,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
say
then?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
our
question.
you
may
be
able
to
get
a
recovery
because
the
corporation
laws
of
a
various
state,
very
enormous,
at
least
they
did
when
i
asked
you
about
it
which
is
a
long
time
ago.
they're
very
enormous,
for
instance
whether
--
whether
a
member
of
the
board,
whether
a
director
can
be
a
party
to
a
contract
of
the
corporation,
whether
he's
entitled
to
vote,
whether
he
can
be
in
the
room
when
they
take
a
vote.
all
those
things
are
questions
of
substantive
law
on
which
the
states
have
their
different
policies
on
the
basis
of
which
you
may
or
may
not
recover.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
has
nothing
