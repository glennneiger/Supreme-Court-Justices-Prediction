justice
charles
e.
whittaker
on
mr.
justice
brennan's
hypothesis,
do
you
think
there
would
be
any
equity
sufficient
to
enable
the
plaintiff
even
to
maintain
the
suit?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
alleged
the
facts
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
alleged
--
suppose
--
assumed
he
alleges
the
facts
that
mr.
justice
brennan
assumed.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it's
just
a
matter
of
disagreement
between
the
directors
and
the
stockholder.
is
that
enough
to
give
the
stockholder
a
right
to
supplant
the
directors
in
their
judgment
as
to
whether
the
suit
should
be
brought?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
the
three
months
--
yes,
in
this
case,
at
least
the
generalities
that
one
can
agree
with

justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
levy,
may
i
ask,
is
the
object
of
this
argument
to
show
that
the
findings
made
by
judge
mathes
to
the
--
are
not
supported
by
evidence?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
did
have
an
18-day
trial
up
before
judge
mathes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
he
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
isn't
the
trouble
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
levy,
however,
if
judge
mathes'
findings
made
it
to
conclusion
of
the
trial
are
supported
by
--
by
evidence,
then
we're
now
down
to
questions
of
law,
aren't
we?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
said
they
acted
in
good
faith
and
this
was
a
matter
of
judgment.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
does
it
mean
then?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it's
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it's
just
a
fact
raised
for
the
pleading
preliminary
to
the
determination
of
the
question
of
whether
he
had
time
to
try
the
case.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
isn't
that
the
law?
