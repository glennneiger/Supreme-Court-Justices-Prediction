of
course,
those
findings
are
significant
only
if
domination
is
a
requirement.
justice
john
m.
harlan
because
the
court
--
if
domination
is
not
a
requirement,
the
court
expressly
found
that
a
demand
would
have
been
futile
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
and
therefore,
the
absence
of
a
demand
would
not
officiate
the
jurisdiction?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
that
really,
the
findings
beg
the
question
as
far
as
the
problem
we
got
here
is
concerned.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
if
--
of
course,
if
domination
is
a
prerequisite
than
the
findings,
i
would
suppose
you
can't
get
over
those.
justice
john
m.
harlan
domination
is
not
a
requirement.
this
finding
is
beside
the
point
for
this
particular
purpose.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
would
be
the
consequence
of
that
rule
in
a
situation
where
the
stockholder
is
suing,
not
the
directors
but
a
third
party?
and
where
in
that
situation
you
would
have
no
antagonism,
no
personal
interest
between
the
--
antagonistic
interest
between
the
interest
of
the
directors
and
the
corporation?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
then
if
we
let
(voice
overlap)
as
aligned
as
a
plaintiff?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
why
doesn't
that
go
to
the
merits
instead
of
jurisdiction?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
see
where
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
do
--
what
do
you
do
with
chicago
against
mills?
