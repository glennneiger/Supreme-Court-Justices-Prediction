mr.
oliver
b.
schwab
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
perhaps
to
continue
on
the
same
line
for
a
moment
and
bring
into
a
little
clearer
focus
what
happened
in
this
trial,
i
don't
quite
agree
that
in
every
instance,
the
issue
of
the
merits
is
relevant
to
the
issue
of
control
or
antagonism
or
to
the
issue
of
disability
of
the
corporation.
it
so
happened
that
in
the
instance
given
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
it
may
not
be
relevant
for
the
court
to
inquire
whether
or
not
the
promissory
note
was
valid,
whether
or
not
the
corporation
owed
it.
however,
in
this
case,
judge
mathes,
in
an
effort
to
lean
over
backwards
and
to
accept
every
possible
inquiry
into
the
facts
relevant
to
jurisdiction,
listened
to
evidence
not
only
as
to
the
freedom
of
action
of
these
directors,
but
also
looked
at
the
contract.
now,
it
is
true
and
this
is
partially
an
answer
to
your
inquiry,
mr.
justice
black.
it
is
true
that
the
contract
might
be
circumstantial
evidence
that
the
directors
were
dominated
or
acted
fraudulently.
that
is
the
relevance,
only,
the
only
relevance
of
the
contract
in
this
situation.
so,
in
the
case
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
inquiry,
it
is
possible
that
if
a
plaintiff
comes
in
and
says,
“the
corporation
refuses
to
sue
on
$100,000
promissory
note.”
the
evidence
may
be
as
follows,
the
directors
may
take
the
stand
and
say,
“we
don't
think
it's
collectible.”
they
may
say,
“we
don't
think
we
have
a
good
cause
of
action.”
or
they
may
say,
“we
have
appraised
this
and
in
our
opinion,
the
corporation
would
waste
its
money
suing.”
now
whether
or
not
--
whether
or
not
the
promissory
note
is
valid
would
only
be
circumstantial
evidence
to
show
that
the
directors
were
or
were
not
acting
fraudulently.
that
is
all.
now,
in
this
case,
judge
mathes
need
not
to
have
inquire
into
this
contract.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
he
opened
the
door
that
we
had
an
unlimited
trial,
that
this
case
went
15
days
or
more,
that
this
case
involved
a
hundred
and
some
exhibits
that
this
contract
was
shown
and
the
testimony
of
the
executive
vice
president
to
be
a
contract
from
which
warner
brothers
would
derived
over
a
$11
million
in
profits,
that
this
contract
were
shown
not
to
be
an
unusual
transaction,
but
one
of
steady
current
of
business
transaction.
mr.
oliver
b.
schwab
if
the
evidence
had
shown
that
these
directors
were
acting
fraudulently
and
under
domination,
then
this
corporation
would
not
have
been
acting
in
its
best
interest.
mr.
oliver
b.
schwab
i
would
say
that
it
would,
but
this
court
found
after
the
trial
court
found
and
the
circuit
court
examined
the
record
and
found
that
there
was
no
fraud
and
that
there
was
no
domination.
and
that
therefore,
this
corporation,
warner
brothers,
was
acting
in
its
own
best
interest
even
though
it
was
in
disagreement
with
the
plaintiff
over
whether
this
suit
should
be
brought.
mr.
oliver
b.
schwab
well,
it
might
be
enough,
your
honor.
but
in
this
case,
judge
mathes
found
after
a
protracted
trial
that
it
was
not
enough.
he
listened
to
the
evidence.
mr.
levy
had
an
unlimited
opportunity.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
december
15th
of
this
year,
we
will
be
nine
years
in
this
litigation.
and
may
i
point
out
that
we
didn't
file
a
single
delaying
tactic.
we've
didn't
demur.
we
didn't
do
anything.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
would
like
to
come
to
trial
whether
it's
before
the
federal
court,
the
state
court
or
even
a
justice
of
the
peace.
we
feel
our
--
we
feel
we
have
the
right
with
the
matter.
mr.
oliver
b.
schwab
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
oliver
b.
schwab
that
is
correct.
mr.
oliver
b.
schwab
because,
your
honor,
as
is
necessary
and
this
court
has
frequently
said,
“the
federal
court
should
examine
the
issue
of
jurisdiction.”
and
on
the
issue
of
--
mr.
oliver
b.
schwab
well,
may
i
say
that
the
court
held
that
if
mr.
levy
wanted
to
introduce
the
contract
and
examine
whether
it
appeared
fair,
a
circumstantial
evidence.
now,
i'm
paraphrasing
the
meaning
of
the
court's
position
that
here
was
evidence
by
the
directors
as
to
their
conduct.
here
was
all
kinds
of
evidence
that
they
were
fair
and
free.
this
is
my
epitomization
of
it.
they
were
not
acting
under
domination.
they
were
not
acting
under
fraud.
they
were
fair
and
free.
now,
mr.
levy
says,
"that
isn't
enough.
i
want
to
show
this
contract.
i
want
to
show
by
implication
or
innuendo
that
something
is
wrong
here
that
the
court
hasn't
seen."
so,
the
court
said,
“introduce
the
contract.”
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
introduced
a
dozen
other
contract
of
similar
nature
that
warner
brothers
had
entered
into.
this
was
no
odd
contract.
this
was
a
course
of
business
and
it
so
happened
that
this
was
a
desirable
course
of
business
and
this
--
this
endeavor
to
introduce
nepotism
under
these
cases,
is
to
me
beside
the
point.
this
is
strictly
a
case
of
federal
jurisdiction,
and
the
court
held
a
fair
trial
on
federal
jurisdiction.
and
if
anything,
mr.
justice
black,
the
court
went
too
far
in
my
opinion
in
permitting
everything
into
the
record
that
could
possibly
touch
upon
the
issue
of
domination
or
control
or
basically,
disability.
mr.
oliver
b.
schwab
no,
sir.
then,
the
court
would
have
been
governed
under
erie
versus
tompkins
by
the
rule
of
california.
and
then,
mr.
levy
might
have
decided
he
wanted
10
more
days
of
evidence.
i
don't
know.
he
had
a
free
hand
here
and
incidentally
--
mr.
oliver
b.
schwab
there
has
not
been
a
complete
trial
on
the
merits.
what
i've
said
is
there
has
been
a
complete
and
unlimited
trial
on
issue
of
jurisdiction.
and
that
issue
--
mr.
oliver
b.
schwab
well,
what
mr.
williams
has
said
is
what
i
started
out
to
say,
that
the
evidence
may
apply
to
both
issues.
in
other
words,
under
state
law
in
california
as
was
said
here
yesterday,
the
substantive
law
may
be
that
if
the
directors
act
honestly,
if
they
are
fair
and
free,
that's
the
end
of
it.
that's
a
matter
of
state
substantive
law,
but
it
may
also
be
a
matter
relevant
to
doctor
and
harrington.
now,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
this
court
gave
the
plaintiff
unlimited
time
to
prove
anything
he
wanted,
directors
circumstantial
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
these
directors
were
fair
and
free.
and
when
he
have
no
more
to
say,
and
incidentally,
while
i
was
going
to
--
to
--
with
respect
to
mr.
levy's
remark
that
i
have
no
further
evidence
to
offer
under
those
circumstances,
that
related
to
mr.
william's
statement.
in
other
words,
mr.
levy
said,
"well,
maybe,
i
want
to
examine.
maybe,
i
thought
of
whether
i
should
examine
some
of
the
directors."
incidentally,
he
had
any
period
of
time
to
do
that.
the
depositions
were
taken.
he
could
have
had
them
in
court.
this
was
up
to
his
freewill.
now,
the
last
day
after
15
days
of
trial
and
he
wasn't
cut
off,
this
court
i
think
would
have
gone
on
for
10
more
days.
he
said,
"well,
maybe
i
should
examine."
then,
mr.
william
said,
"look,
it
is
our
position
that
the
corporation
considers
this
a
fair
contract,
and
therefore,
where
the
corporation
wouldn't
have
sued
because
it
considered
it
a
fair
and
good
contract."
then,
mr.
levy
said,
"well,
under
those
circumstances,
that
is
all."
in
other
words,
he
had
his
full
opportunity
to
try
this
issue
of
jurisdiction
and
to
attempt
to
show
under
doctor
versus
harrington
that
the
corporation
was
in
antagonistic
hand
and
after
that
trial,
he
did.
now,
--
and
that,
after
that
trial,
the
court
held
that
he
had
not
proved
that
the
corporation
was
disabled
and
therefore
the
court
lack
federal
jurisdiction.
i
want
to
add
this
by
way
of
illuminating
background
to
show
how
clearly
this
is
a
case
strictly
of
federal
jurisdiction.
this
controversy
started
by
suit
in
new
york
in
1948.
these
are
matters
of
judicial
notice.
immediately
after
that,
there
were
piggyback
bases,
almost
chinese
copies.
there
were
19
cases
filed
in
new
york.
there
were
nine
or
ten
of
them
in
the
state
court,
nine
in
the
federal
court.
it
was
because
of
the
bond
rule
and
the
case
of
cohen
versus
beneficial
loan
that
the
plaintiff's
attorneys
in
new
york
forwarded
the
cases
to
california
and
there
were
two,
or
three,
or
four
or
five,
more.
now,
some
of
the
state
courses
in
--
courts
in
new
york
are
--
the
cases
are
still
pending.
this
is
no
question
whether
plaintiff
doesn't
have
a
form.
he's
not
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations.
he
is
trying
to
elect
the
federal
court.
he
is
trying
to
circumvent
the
rule
of
doctor
versus
harrington.
the
only
issue
here
is
that
whether
he
has
or
hasn't
the
cause
of
action.
we
think
he
has
it
and
we
think
that
under
california
law,
he'd
be
held
not
to
have
under
the
substantive
law,
but
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
that
the
federal
jurisdiction
in
this
case
has
not
been
proven.
i
--
i
had
some
other
things
to
say
on
this
but
i'm
afraid
i
--
i
have
ran
out.
thank
you.
