justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
--
in
the
house
that
--
that
word
was
“section”?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
discussion
of
it
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
there
must
have
been
some
of
that
done
at
this
time.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
a
regular,
i
suppose,
regulations
of
the
department
of
interior
in
response
to
the
legislation
of
congress
that
identified
the
mineral
land.
to
take
--
take
the
place
land
here
in
section
(a)
of
so
and
so
that
hasn't
--
that
had
not
been
declared
to
be
a
mineral
land
by
the
department
of
the
interior.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
anyone
got
that
piece
of
property
and,
later,
the
whole
vane
was
discovered
on
it
or
coal
or
whatever
it
was.
they
didn't
lose
their
title,
did
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
did
their
--
their
title
didn't
right
them
until
that
particular
section
had
been
passed
on,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
the
railroad
had
either
within
its
power
or
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
government
to
locate
its
railroad,
and
then,
it
did
have
a
choice
within
10
miles
of
--
of
that
mine.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
had
a
choice
of
everything
except
mineral
lands.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and,
that
was
at
the
time
that
the
act
was
passed?
both
of
those
things
were
in
the
act.
now,
was
there
a
--
then
a
legal
provision
as
to
how
the
railroad
could
tell
what
were
these
mineral
lands?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
it
the
legislation
of
congress
that
fixed
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor
general,
are
there
other
grants,
in
addition
to
this
one,
which
raises
the
question
who
would
get
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me,
what
--
what
title
interest
did
the
railroad
get
under
this
grant,
as
you
see?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they're
feasible
if
they
don't
do
certain
things.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
was
the
government's
position
as
to
the
interest?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
i
--
if
i
can
quote
correctly
some
of
the
answers
you
gave
mr.
justice
reed,
you
suggested
that,
as
to
a
given
piece
of
land,
what
ultimately
might
be
the
interest
might
depend
upon
when,
if
at
all,
this
determination
whether
there
were
minerals
in
the
land
had
been
made,
when,
if
at
all,
the
line
of
the
right
of
way
had
been
established
and
agreed
upon,
and
when,
if
at
all,
certain
other
things
had
been
accomplished.
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
certainly
strikes
me
as
meaning
they
got
no
interest
at
all
until
all
these
things
are
done.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
right
of
way
was
going
to
be
surveyed.
it's
going
to
be
laid
down
and
determined
on
before
they
--
they
could
determine
whether
there
are
10
miles
on
each
sidewise.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and,
once
they
had
determined
where
that
was,
wasn't
there
some
provision
that
it
had
to
be
approved
by
the
government
or
something?
could
they
put
the
railroad
any
place
they
pleased?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
discretion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
very
explicit,
to
me
at
least,
if
you
want
to
say
where
the
--
where
the
mines
would
run.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
they
did
do
that?
they
did
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
set
that
out
and
they
defined
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
--
did
they
have
to
accept
that
or
approve
it
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
their
--
it
was
their
choice
rather
than
the
government's?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
did
--
did
the
government
ever
determine
whether
some
of
these
lands
was
mineral
lands
with
implication
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
they
ever
determine
that
any
part
of
the
right
of
way
was
mineral
land?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
--
you
--
what's
the
argument
then,
that
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
government
can
now
determine
that
it's
mineral
lands
and
take
it
back?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
from
the
right
of
way.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
from
the
right
of
way.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
i
get
that
to
mean
distance?
since
all
we
are
concerned
with
in
this
case
is
the
oil
and
gas
rights
underlying
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
right
of
way
itself.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
point
is
that
all
was
given
was
the
right
of
way
without
any
of
the
underlying
mineral
rights,
whether
or
not
there
ever
was
a
determination
by
the
government
that
they
were
mineral
lands,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
--
the
thing
that
confuses
me,
i
think,
is
--
i
gather
now,
you're
making
a
distinction
between
place
lands
and
the
right
of
way.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
there
may
have
been
interest
in
the
place
lands
which
depended
upon
and
were
determined
by
government
decisions
whether
or
not
some
of
those
place
lands
were
or
were
not
mineral
lands.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
true?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
not
so
as
to
the
right
of
way.
as
to
the
right
of
way,
the
government's
position
is
that
nothing
went
but
the
right
to
use
the
surface
for
the
railroad,
that
any
minerals
underneath,
with
the
exception
of
this
1866
amendment,
were
retained.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
--
as
i
understand
that
the
department
of
the
interior
has
never
determined
that
these
were
mineral
lands?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
--
is
the
1866
act
printed
in
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
still
have
the
same
problem
of
what
is
a
mineral
land.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor
general,
may
i
ask
finally
whether
it's
necessary
to
the
position
the
government
takes
that
we
accept
your
construction
of
that
proviso
that
all
mineral
lands
shall
be
excepted
from
the
operation
of
this
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
necessary
to
your
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
make
weight?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
where
are
we
going
to
get
that,
from
legislative
history
or
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather,
then,
that
the
change
from
“section”
to
“act”
in
the
proviso
you
think
is
reflective
of
the
general
concept
that
that's
all
the
government
intended
to
give
at
the
time.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
clary,
am
i
correct
that
right
of
way
is
uniformly
400
feet
in
width,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
where
first
towns
have
grown
up
along
the
right
of
way,
i
suppose
you
sometimes
conveyed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
there
been
leases?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
industrial
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
sites?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
down
the
existing
main
line
right
of
way,
i
believe
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
the
possible
grant
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
are
no
branch
lines.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
not
--
but
none
involved
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
never
drilled
out
of
wells,
did
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
--
when
did
they
issue
these
patents?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
must
have
been
some
--
something
that
caused
the
issuance
of
the
patent.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
understand.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
understand
yet
when
the
acquisition
or
what
triggered
the
issue
of
the
patent.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
was
what
gave
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
authority
for
the
issuance
of
it
and,
before
they
were
issued,
i
understand
you
to
say
that
there
was
a
decision
as
to
whether
there
were
any
mineral
lands
within
that
area.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
what
shows
us
that
that
was
a
part
of
the
regulation?
was
there
a
regulation
to
that
effect?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
is
the
record
clear
on
that?
is
that
the
difficulty,
that
the
record
isn't
clear?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
must
have
been
a
declaration
made
by
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
someone
as
to
what
was
mineral
land
sometime
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
before
the
patent.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
clary,
getting
back
to
the
right
of
way
for
a
moment.
i
gather,
after
this
grant
under
the
1862
act,
something
remained
to
be
done
to
locate
the
right
of
way,
did
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
400
feet.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
how
long
was
it
after
the
grant
that
that
was
completed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
when
is
it
in
--
what
is
your
position
as
to
when
in
point
of
time
you
acquired
what
you
say
was
a
fee?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
all
--
all
the
discussion
you've
been
having
with
mr.
justice
reed
on
the
matter
of
patents
is
--
is
not
pertinent
at
all
to
the
interest
you
acquired
or
settled,
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
alleging
and
claiming
or
acquiring
it
from
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then,
the
provision
in
section
4
that
it
had
to
be
approved
as
having
been
properly
constructed,
and
so
forth,
and
--
and
then
authorizing
the
patent.
no
patent
was
issued
for
the
right
of
way
lands.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
you
didn't
have
a
right
of
way
granted
to
you,
actually
located,
until
you
had
built
your
40
miles
and
had
it
approved
by
the
commissioners
appointed
by
the
president.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
it
had
to
be
approved.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
you
--
you
really
did
not
know
where
your
alliance
were
until
you
had
the
approval
under
section
4,
didn't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
do
either
of
those
grants
have
anything
comparable
to
this
proviso
of
section
3?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
a
phrase
this
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
subject
to
the
operation
of
this
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me,
may
i
--
may
i
get
this
clear
now,
mr.
solicitor
general.
i
think,
just
before
you
sat
down,
i
had
asked
you
whether
you
were
relying
upon
the
proviso
as
if
it
were
written
into
section
2,
are
you
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
guess
that's
the
way
i
phrased
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
one
of
your
arguments
and
one
of
the
propositions
upon
which
you
do
rely
is
that
that
proviso
is
to
be
read
into
two
as
if
it
appeared
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
say
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
say
that,
mr.
solicitor
general,
even
though,
as
i
understand
it,
two
of
those
cases
involved
grants
where
this
proviso
in
haec
verba
appears?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
suppose
--
i
understand
--
as
i
understand
mr.
clary,
in
two
of
those
cases,
two
--
involved
two
grants
with
the
precise
proviso
that
we
have
before
us
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
you
say
then
we
ought
to
pay
no
significance
to
the
fact
that
the
grants
did
have
that
provision
since
the
issue
of
mineral
rights
was
not
involved
either
case.
