--

--
of
any
kind.
chief
justice
earl

is
that
the
language
that
you
just
read
in
the
townsend
case

warren
why
couldn't
it
--
if
it
has
the

subject
to

is
mining
or
developing
for
oil
for
the
purposes

chief
justice
earl

but,
what
is
or
what
would
there
be
to
prevent
them

mr.

before

may
i
ask
just
one
question
about
the
wording
in
this
act
that
the

commented
on.
he
said
that
the
mineral
reservation,
first,
was
as
to
this
section.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
first,
as
to
the
“act,”
then,
they
changed
it
in
the
house
to
the
“section.”
and
then,
in
the
senate,
they
changed
it
back
to
the
“act”
and
that,
now,
it
says
there's
--
the
minerals
shall
be
reserved
in
--
in
all
lands
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
the
act.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--

justice
earl
warren
since
you're
