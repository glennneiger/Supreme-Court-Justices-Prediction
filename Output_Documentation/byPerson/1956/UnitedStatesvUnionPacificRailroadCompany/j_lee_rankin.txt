mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
action
where
the
united
states
seeks
an
injunction
against
the
union
pacific
railroad
company
for
its
taking
gas
and
oil
from
under
the
right
of
way
in
a
small
area
of
an
80-acre
section
in
the
state
of
wyoming.
the
question
that
is
presented
is
whether
the
grant
by
the
united
states
to
the
respondent
in
the
year
1862
under
the
terms
of
“the
right
of
way
through
the
public
lands
for
the
construction
of
said
railroad
and
telegraph
line”
conveyed
the
title
to
oil
and
gas
deposits
underlying
the
right
of
way
so
that
respondent
may
remove
or
dispose
of
such
deposits.
the
issue
in
the
case
entirely
turns
upon
the
construction
of
the
statute.
the
statute
is
set
out
on
pages
2
and
3
of
the
government's
brief.
i'd
like
to
call
to
your
attention
briefly
the
terms
which
we
think
the
controversy
turns
upon.
you
will
note
in
section
2
that
--
that
there
is
a
grant
of
the
right
of
way
and
a
provision
for
materials
for
the
railroad's
construction.
and,
the
right
of
way
grant,
like
that
in
the
great
northern
case,
is
of
“the”
right
of
way,
not
“a”
right
of
way,
and
also
includes
the
right
to
take
from
lands
adjacent
to
the
land
of
the
road
earth,
stone,
timber,
and
other
materials
for
construction
thereof.
the
grant
is
to
the
extent
of
200
feet
on
each
side
of
the
line
of
the
road.
and,
section
3
is
the
section
in
regard
to
what
is
generally
called
place
lands.
it
involves
the
section
that
provides
for
the
financing
of
the
road,
providing
the
lands
by
means
of
which
it
was
thought
the
railroad
would
be
induced
and
able
to
finance
the
construction
necessary
to
complete
it.
and,
in
that
section,
there
is
a
proviso,
after
providing
the
large
number
of
acres
that
would
be
allowed
to
the
railroad
if
it
accomplished
the
construction
provided,
about
halfway
down
on
page
3,
that
all
mineral
lands
shall
be
excepted
from
the
operation
of
this
act.
and,
i
dwell
upon
the
word
“act”
because
the
legislative
history
in
regard
to
that
is
quite
important
in
the
eyes
of
the
government.
there
are
several
rules
of
construction
that
apply
to
the
statute
or
in
the
grant
in
this
case
and
are
generally
recognized.
one
of
them
is
that
any
grant
of
this
type
by
the
sovereign
must
be
strictly
construed
that
it
shall
be
liberally
construed
in
regard
to
accomplishing
the
purpose
by
which
the
grant
was
made.
and,
if
all,
you
are
trying
to
determine
the
rights
that
will
pass
under
the
grant,
that
it
must
be
strictly
determined
in
accordance
with
the
explicit
and
clear
terms
of
conveyance
in
the
act
of
grant.
now,
the
legislative
history
of
this
particular
proviso
was
that,
in
the
house,
they
first
had
a
provision
for
act,
that
is,
that
the
mineral
lands
that
were
not
to
be
covered
by
the
grant
would
be
limited
to
the
act
generally.
and
then,
it
was
amended
in
the
house
to
apply
only
to
that
particular
section
which
would
have
the
effect
of
applying
the
reservation
of
the
mineral
lands
under
the
grant
of
the
act
only
to
the
place
lands
in
section
3.
then,
when
the
bill
got
to
dissent
without
any
explanation,
we
were
able
to
discover
the
senate
changed
and
put
back
in
the
word
“act,”
so
that
the
reservation
of
the
grant
of
the
entire
act
should
not
apply
--
should
apply
to
the
entire
act,
all
sections
and
not
merely
to
the
section
3
in
which
the
proviso
was
contained.
now,
there's
a
difference
between
the
government
and
the
respond
in
regard
to
the
purpose
of
that
change.
it's
contended
by
the
respondent
that
the
change
was
made
so
that
subsequent
sections
of
the
same
act,
which
provided
for
other
railroads
to
be
or
to
have
certain
place
lands
and
have
certain
financing
assistance
through
such
lands,
would
have
the
provisions
of
that
section
apply
to
it
and
that,
therefore,
the
word
“act”
was
inserted
for
that
purpose.
but,
the
act
provided
that
these
subsequent
grants
should,
in
all
cases,
be
upon
the
same
terms
and
conditions
in
all
respects
as
provided
in
this
act
for
the
construction
of
the
railroad
and
telegraph
line
first
mentioned.
the
government
contends
that
you
don't
have
to
insert
the
word
“act”
in
the
proviso
at
all
to
make
that,
the
whole
provision
in
regard
to
the
prior
sections
of
the
right
of
way
grant
and
the
section
3
place
lands
grant,
apply.
that
the
only
purpose
that
congress
could
have
had
was
to
carry
out
its
purpose
of
withholding
mineral
lands
from
the
grant
involved
under
this
act.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
was,
first,
“section”
and
then
it
was
changed
--
it
was,
first,
“act”
and
then
it
was
changed
to
“section”
in
the
house.
then,
in
the
senate,
it
was
changed
to
“act”
and
the
house
agreed
to
“act”
change,
so
that
the
bill
as
finally
passed
was
“act.”
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
but,
it
does
seem
to
us
that
it
shows
a
considerable
deliberation
when
the
history
shows
that
it
was,
first,
a
provision
of
act
and
then
changed
to
“section”
deliberately
by
the
house.
and
then,
the
senate
changed
it
to
“act”
and
the
house
agreed
to
“act,”
so
that
there
was
complete
agreement
in
the
final
terms
that
was
passed
in
--
as
“act.”
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
construe
it
as
meaning
that
not
only
should
there
be
no
mineral
lands
in
any
place
lands
that
were
granted
under
the
act,
but
that
there
could
be
no
mineral
lands
involved
or
mineral
rights
involved
in
the
right
of
way
which
was
part
of
the
same
act.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there
is,
and
in
the
history
of
congress
dealing
with
this
subject,
it
did,
in
time,
get
around
to
the
consideration
of
mineral
rights
as
distinguished
from
mineral
lands.
and,
the
court
of
appeals
relied
upon
that
as
one
of
the
principal
grounds
for
its
holding.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
that's
true,
but
we
think
that
the
--
the
action
of
congress
in
the
history
of
the
time
was
such
that
congress
want
to
make
as
clear
as
it
possibly
could
still
making
it
possible
for
the
railroad
to
go
through
to
withhold
minerals
and
that
was
the
fundamental
purpose
that
congress
was
trying
to
carry
out
by
this
action
in
the
proviso
and
also
the
history
of
the
period
at
the
times.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
there
is
not.
it
says
mineral
lands
and
not
mineral
rights.
now,
the
history
of
the
period
indicates
very
clearly
that
the
congress
was
very
much
interested
in
mineral
lands
and
minerals
and
the
potential
for
the
country
in
the
development
of
minerals
from
the
period
of
1849,
with
the
great
discovery
in
california
and
the
gold
strike,
and
it
was
upper
most
in
their
mind.
also,
it
must
be
kept
in
our
minds
that,
at
that
time,
in
considering
this
history,
gold
was
selling
for
$16
an
ounce
and
that
if
congress
happened,
by
purposely
or
inadvertently,
to
include
great
gold
strikes
within
this
grant,
that
they
might
very
probably
be
far
more
valuable
than
all
of
the
lands
that
they
were
trying
to
provide
to
aid
this
construction.
but,
throughout
this
period,
from
1849
to
1862,
the
congress
was
very
careful
in
showing
its
intent
that
it
should
withhold
the
mineral
lands
from
any
grants
to
railroads
or
others.
this
court
held,
in
view
of
that
history,
in
a
grant
to
the
state
of
california
and
another
grant
to
the
state
of
utah
of
school
lands
in
certain
alternate
sections
that
even
though
those
grants
said
nothing
about
the
withholding
of
mineral
lands
with
the
proviso
such
as
we
have
in
this
grant
--
this
act
of
1862,
that
it
was
the
history
and
the
intention
of
congress
during
this
period
to
protect
these
very
valuable
minerals
and
it
was
the
purpose
of
congress
by
that
act.
and,
although
there
was
no
such
statement
in
two
--
in
both
of
those
cases,
that
the
grant
to
the
state
of
california
of
the
school
lands
did
not
include
any
mineral
lands
within
its
grant
and
the
grant
to
the
state
of
utah
did
not
include
any
such
lands
within
its
grant.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
granting
acts
of
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
california
and
utah
were
before
1862.
i
think
they
were
sometime
between
1850
and
1862.
they
were
before
1862.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
there
was
a
pattern
that
was
followed
that's
described
in
the
mining
company
case
by
this
court
in
which
it
dealt
with
the
california
lands
school
grants
in
which
it
--
the
court
described
the
history
and
said
that
it
was
the
purpose
of
the
congress
for
the
period
from
about
1849
or
1850
onto
1866
to
withhold
all
mineral
lands
from
any
grants
and
that,
during
that
period,
the
congress
was
trying
to
decide
and
determine
upon
a
program
for
the
handling
of
mineral
lands
and
how
they
could
be
acquired.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
very
largely,
by
the
way
it
was
granted
and
by
virtue
of
other
provisions
where
they
would
not
even
permits
the
lands
--
the
mineral
lands
to
be
surveyed,
so
that
there
couldn't
be
any
preemption
or
entries
or
other
action
in
accordance
with
the
homestead
and
other
special
law.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
seems
to
us
that
it
indicated
how
clearly
congress
wanted
to
do
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and,
the
grant
should
be
construed
where
it's
in
behalf
of
the
whole
country
in
such
a
way
as
to
try
to
carry
out
the
purpose
of
the
congress
in
making
it
and,
certainly,
it
was
not
necessary
to
have
this
railroad
constructed
that
it
be
able
to
explore
for
business
purposes
and
extract
oil
and
gas
any
more
than
it
was
to
explore
for
gold
or
precious
metals
in
this
area.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
now,
the
--
the
court
has
said,
in
several
cases
that
we
have
to
deal
with,
that
there
was
a
limited
fee
in
connection
with
--
with
grants
under
this
very
act
of
the
right
of
way.
and,
we
think
that
those
cases
do
not
need
to
be
overruled,
that
if
they
are
not
extended
to
cover
oil
and
gas
which
was
not
--
has
never
been
considered
by
this
court
before
with
regard
to
this
particular
act
and
if
they
are
limited
to
the
facts
of
those
cases
and
what
the
court
was
trying
to
deal
with
in
allowing
the
right
of
way
to
be
used
in
a
manner
that
would
be
properly
contemplated
for
the
railroad
purposes,
that
the
cases
present
no
real
problem
to
the
court.
but,
to
try
to
extend
them
to
cover
oil
and
gas
which
even
at
this
late
date,
almost
94
years
later,
it's
the
first
time
that
it's
being
asserted
in
the
courts,
that
they
have
any
such
right
and,
certainly,
is
not
necessary
or
closely
related
in
any
way
to
the
railroad
operation
or
what
congress
had
in
mind
at
that
time.
now,
we
concede,
as
argued
in
the
--
by
respondent
in
the
brief,
that
the
government
was
eager
to
have
the
railroads
constructed
in
the
west
during
this
period,
and
there's
no
question
about
that
and
the
government
concedes.
but,
the
--
at
the
same
time,
the
congress
was
very
explicit
and
careful
not
to
make
grants
that
would
include
the
minerals
and
mineral
rights
in
connection
with
these
lands
and
to
try
to
withhold,
in
every
way
that
it
could
conceive
at
the
time,
the
mineral
lands
from
any
exploitation
or
being
given
away
in
relation
to
these
grants.
now,
it
has
been
said
in
the
great
northern
case
by
the
court
that
the
united
states
did
make
lavish
grants
in
connection
with
these
railroad
grants.
particularly
talking
about
that
case,
the
northern
pacific
is
probably
the
most
extravagant
or
elaborates
grants
and
the
union
pacific
was
also
very
substantial
large
grants.
but,
if
you
take
into
account
the
fact
that
the
government
was,
in
one
section,
placing
a
value
of
$1.25
per
acre
on
the
lands,
if
they
were
not
sold
within
a
certain
time,
that
they
would
be
open
for
sale
at
that
price.
you
could
see
that
the
united
states
was
trying
to
evaluate
the
grant
that
it
was
making
in
relation
to
the
problem
to
be
solved
in
providing
for
the
construction
of
this
railroad.
well,
if
you
would
try
to
apply
that
to
oil
and
gas
values,
which
were
even
then
developed
in
1862
in
this
country,
and
the
state
of
pennsylvania
where
we
had
3
million
barrels
of
oil
being
produced,
and
it's
fair
to
assume
congress
was
aware
of
that
situation,
that
the
grant,
in
--
in
--
if
you
would
construe
it
to
include
minerals
and
gas
and
oil
and
other
rights
of
that
type,
would
certainly
be
almost
beyond
calculation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice
burton
asked
me
about
the
--
the
date
of
the
grant
to
california
and
also
to
utah.
the
date
of
the
grant
to
california
was
1853.
i
also
said
that
the
grant
to
utah
was
earlier
and
it
was
in
1894,
which
was
considerably
after
even
the
great
northern
grant
probably
due
to
the
fact
of
the
time
it
became
a
state,
but
it
was
not
in
this
prior
period.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there
was
very
largely
under
the
local
regulations
of
the
various
areas
and
they
--
the
miners
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there
were
some
congressional
enactments,
too,
that
provided
for
leases
and
that
the
government
should
have
royalties
covering
some
areas
in
indiana
and
missouri
and
some
others,
and
then,
the
congress
had
recognized
the
local
mining
laws
that
had
been
established
by
the
miners.
and,
in
view
of
these
great
gold
strikes
and
the
interest
the
whole
country
had,
the
congress
determined
to
look
into
the
entire
matter
and
see
what
should
be
done.
and,
it
wasn't
until
1866
that
they
developed
a
considerable
program
for
the
acquisition
of
mineral
lands
and
how
it
could
be
done,
and
so
forth.
that
is
referred
to
by
respondents
in
their
brief
and
they
talk
about
the
fact
that
this
was
one
way
to
get
the
mineral
lands
or
the
minerals,
under
the
right
of
way,
developed.
the
argument
seems
rather
shallow
to
us
in
view
of
the
fact
that
it's
almost
100
years
after
the
grant
and
they're
just
starting
to
try
to
develop
them
as
far
as
oil
and
gas
is
concerned.
but,
furthermore,
when
congress
did
see
fit
to
provide
for
the
--
a
manner
in
which
you
could
acquire
or
obtain
title
to
mineral
lands,
they
were
very
careful
to
put
certain
limitations
on
it.
one
of
which
was
that
you
had
to
make
some
development
of
at
least
$100
a
year,
a
total
of
$500,
in
order
to
be
able
to
get
title
to
it.
and,
another
was
that
you
were
limited
to
the
extent
of
the
vane
that
you
would
be
able
to
get
the
title
to
the
land
above
and
--
and
be
able
to
explore
as
a
mineral
right,
and
that
even
a
group
or
association
could
only
follow
a
vane
or
a
load
for
a
certain
distance.
so,
there
was
a
deliberate
attempt
on
the
part
of
congress,
when
it
did
address
itself
to
this
particular
problem,
to
try
to
avoid
the
monopoly
and
to
also
encourage
and
require
a
considered
and
careful
policy
of
developing
the
minerals
rather
than
being
able
to
transfer
them
to
somebody
like
this
concept
would
be
where
they
could
hold
them
for
100
years
or
1000
years
and
just
have
them
in
the
ground
without
having
the
benefit
of
their
development
for
any
interest
of
he
country.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
was
generally
contemplated
as
lands
that
would
have
minerals
and
the
government
would
then
--
it
was
provided
that
the
government
would,
through
the
department
of
interior,
determine
whether
the
lands
did
have
minerals
and
they
would
then
be
opened
up
after
that
determination
for
preemption
and
entry,
and
so
forth.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
all
that
the
government
would
designate
either
then
or
at
some
future
date
prior
to
the
time
that
the
title
was
acquired
to
them.
there
--
the
--
this
court
has
dealt
with
the
question
of
where
the
minerals
were
discovered
after
the
lands
were
sold
--
the
place
lands
were
sold
by
the
railroad
and
held
that
they
still
could
pass
a
good
title
because
it
was
necessary
to
the
granting
aid
that
they'd
be
able
to
get
money
to
--
for
the
construction
purposes.
but,
it
wasn't
--
congress
knew
that
the
minerals
had
not
all
been
discovered
and
that
government
had
not
been
able,
in
--
back
at
this
date,
to
cover
all
of
these
area
and
determine
the
extent
of
the
mineral
lands.
so,
that
was
in
the
process,
but
the
term
“mineral
lands”
meant
lands
that
were
--
that
did
contain
minerals
and
that
would
be
so
determined
by
the
government
as
it
examined
the
various
tracks
of
land
that
were
in
public
ownership
throughout
the
country.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
some
of
it
had
been
done.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
in
part,
it
was
the
practice
to
try
to
--
for
the
government
to
try
to
determine
whether
they
were
mineral
lands
as
rapidly
as
they
could.
and,
the
vast
areas,
that's
one
of
the
difficulties
that
developed
in
the
history
here
which
i
will
try
to
relate
to
you,
vast
areas
were
withdrawn
from
entry
and
the
right
to
acquire
title
as
settlers
after
this
grant
because
the
railroads
were
given
an
opportunity
to
make
a
choice
of
certain
sections
of
lands
and
they
--
the
grant
did
not
define
exactly
just
what
sections
they
would
get.
they
would
get
the
ultimate
sections
within
a
certain
area
but
that
area
had
to
be
within
a
certain
distance
of
the
right
of
way
or
the
line
of
the
railroad,
and
the
railroad
had
not
--
the
line
of
the
railroad
had
not
yet
been
fixed.
and,
it
was,
later,
determined
that
it
would
start
from
omaha
and
go
at
the
most
direct
route
west,
but
it
could
have
varied
probably
several
hundreds
of
miles
in
trying
to
comply
with
that.
but,
then,
it
was
the
policy
of
the
government
to
try
to
withdraw
large
areas
of
these
lands
from
settlement
during
the
period
that
the
railroad
was
trying
to
determine
whether
some
of
these
were
mineral
lands
and
so
designated
by
the
department
of
interior
and,
therefore,
not
open
to
them
and
they
had
to
take
other
lands
in
place
of
them.
and,
the
settlers
became
very
unhappy
with
the
situation
because,
in
effect,
held
these
lands
back
so
that
they
couldn't
settle
on
them
at
all
while
the
railroad
was
making
up
its
mind
as
to
just
where
the
route
would
be
and
also
what
lands
it
would
take.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
practice
was
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
practice
was
for
the
department
of
interior
to
proceed
to
ascertain
insofar
as
they
could
and,
of
course,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
did
not
and
that
gave
rise
to
some
disputes
later
on
where
they
discovered
minerals
after
the
time
that
the
railroad
had
taken
them
as
place
lands
and
settlers
claimed
that
they
were
entitled
to
them
against
the
interest
of
the
railroad.
and,
this
court
held
that,
for
the
purpose
of
the
grant,
it
was
necessary
that
they'd
be
able
to
pass
the
title
to
them
and
that,
once
the
government
had
made
a
determination
that
they
were
not
mineral
lands,
that
that
was
--
that
would
have
to
be
conclusive
on
the
government.
does
that
answer
your
question?
i'm
sorry.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
probably
the
one
that
the
court
would
be
familiar
with
is
the
one
involving
the
great
northern,
which
was
in
1875.
and,
it
expressly
did
not
include
any
place
lands
at
all.
so,
it
only
involved
a
right
of
way
and
the
same
language
as
far
as
being
“the”
right
of
way
and
not
“a”
right
of
way,
as
characterized
as
in
this
grant.
and,
the
court
held
there
that
oil
and
gas
was
not
included
in
the
grant.
now,
there
were
two
other
provisions
in
that
grant
that
are
different
than
this,
in
this
case,
in
1862.
one
of
them
was
a
provision
that
if
the
railroad
right
of
way
or
line
should
go
through
a
canyon,
defiled,
or
passed,
that
that
would
have
to
be
used
in
common
with
any
other
railroad
that
came
along.
and,
another
was
that,
the
--
as
soon
as
the
right
of
--
the
line
was
established,
that
that
should
be
entered
upon
the
county
land
titles
or
records
and,
after
that
date,
any
conveyances
by
the
government
would
have
to
be
subject
to
it.
now,
the
court
relied
on
those
three
things
in
addition
to
the
policy
in
the
1875
grant
in
the
great
northern
case
in
deciding
that
the
gas
and
oil
did
not
pass
through
the
railroad.
and,
there
is
--
in
the
history,
there
is
an
explanation
for
the
reason
for
each
of
those
other
provisions
in
the
right
of
way
in
the
great
northern
case.
the
canyon,
defiled,
or
passed
provision
was
inserted,
according
to
the
history,
because
railroads
would
get
established
and
have
their
line
determined
through
a
pass
in
that
--
the
area
in
the
great
northern,
and
then,
they
would
not
go
ahead
with
the
construction
but
they
would,
be
able
to
--
because
they
had
the
only
practicable
way
through
the
mountains
at
that
point,
be
able
to
sell
that
line
to
a
great
advantage,
and
all
have
a
monopoly.
and,
the
congress
was
trying
to
meet
that
problem
that
had
developed
in
its
experience
in
making
that
provision.
and,
of
course,
it
had
not
occurred
in
the
union
pacific
because,
at
that
time,
they
were
only
considering
three
different
ways.
one
was
the
southern
line,
and
one
was
the
central,
and
one
was
the
northern.
and,
it
was
in
its
later
period
of
the
history
that
they
try
to
provide
for
additional
railroads
in
the
northern
area.
then,
on
the
latter
provision,
the
--
that
was
inserted
because
the
country
had
developed
to
such
an
extent
between
1862
and
1875
where
the
settlers
which
were
more
--
quite
limited
in
earlier
period,
were
going
out
into
this
country
and
were
very
unhappy
and
complaining
to
congress
because
the
railroad
was
so
slow
in
taking
up
its
particular
grants
and
place
lands
and
establishing
its
line,
and
that
the
--
a
right
to
settle
was
held
up
until
that
was
completed.
so,
by
this
device
of
providing
that
all
conveyances
would
be
subject
to
this
as
soon
as
the
line
was
established
and
would
be
recorded
on
the
local
land
offices,
they
were
trying
to
take
care
of
those
complaints
of
the
settlers
and
be
able
to
go
ahead
with
the
transfers
and
conveyances
to
settlers
instead
of
having
--
having
to
hold
the
matter
in
abeyance
for
such
a
long
period
of
time
and
having
them
unhappy
about
not
being
able
to
enter
and
develop
them.
the
court
also
relied
in
the
great
northern
case
upon
the
principle
that
these
grants
should
be
strictly
construed
in
favor
of
the
government,
that
they
should
be
construed
as
--
with
regard
to
their
purpose
liberally
so
as
to
carry
that
out,
that
the
court
could
find
no
reason
for
any
purpose
in
the
grant
of
the
railroad
right
of
way
and
the
grant
that
was
made
by
congress
to
believe
that
oil
and
gas
was
contemplated
or
intended
in
any
regard
in
connection
with
it.
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
it
in
the
history
and
the
history
of
the
times.
the
court
said
that
the
legislative
policy
changed,
and
that
was
a
very
important
consideration
of
the
court
in
the
great
northern
case
in
regard
to
the
1875
grant.
and,
the
government
concedes
that
the
policy
changed,
but
the
policy
changed
from
time
to
time
as
we
moved
through
this
era
from
the
discovery
of
gold
in
the
1849
on.
and,
it
first
--
the
grant
to
the
illinois
central
was
one
of
the
cases
relied
upon.
it
wasn't
decided
by
this
court.
it
was
decided
by
the
illinois
court
and
court
of
appeals,
and
this
court
did
not
examine
the
question.
it
was
a
grant
of
1850
in
which
where
the
grant
was
made
to
the
state
of
illinois.
and,
there
was
no
provision
and
no
--
of
any
kind
in
regard
to
withholding
mineral
lands.
then,
when
the
grant
was
made
by
the
state
of
illinois
to
the
railroad,
they
made
the
grant
of
the
right
of
way
and
the
lands
in
fee,
simple,
and
so
recited
in
so
many
words.
and,
the
court
relied
a
great
deal
upon
that
terminology
that,
in
1862,
the
history
shows
that
congress
had
progressed
to
the
place
where
it
wanted
to
make
very
certain
that
these
mineral
lands
would
be
withheld,
and
it
so
did.
then,
we
get
down
to
1875
with
the
great
northern
grant,
and
they
didn't
give
them
any
place
lands
of
any
kind.
they
just
gave
them
the
right
of
way.
and,
later
on,
we
get
on
to
the
1909
period
in
which
congress
tried
to
separate
the
surface
from
the
minerals,
dealing
with
the
mineral
rights
question.
but,
it's
contended
by
the
respondent
that
that
showed
that
congress
knew
the
difference
between
mineral
rights
and
mineral
lands
and
was
doing
that
for
the
deliberate
purpose
of
treating
them
as
a
reservation
of
mineral
rights
and
preserving
the
minerals
in
that
manner.
the
government
contends
that
that
wasn't
the
purpose
of
it
at
all.
we
recognize
there
is
a
difference,
but
congress
was
trying
to
protect
mineral
lands,
any
lands
that
had
minerals
on
them,
from
prior
to
1862
right
on
through.
and,
in
1909,
it
was
trying
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
the
surface
use
of
those
lands,
and
the
history
shows
it.
and,
at
that
time,
when
it
tried
to
separate
and
did
separate
it,
the
provision
in
regard
to
the
reservation
of
mineral
rights
and
the
surface
use
of
the
lands
by
the
legislation
in
1909,
the
history
shows
that
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
making
available
to
settlers
the
right
to
use
those
--
the
surface.
and,
the
settlers
were
complaining
that
the
minerals
--
mineral
lands
reservation
was
withholding
these
lands
from
their
use,
that
the
development
of
the
minerals
in
the
lands
would
not,
in
any
way,
interfere
with
the
use,
in
--
to
a
very
large
extent,
of
the
surface
and
that
they
would
be
--
the
one
would
be
separated
from
the
other
in
the
grant
that
they
could
make
use
of
large
areas
of
the
country
which
are
then
--
then
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
they
claim
that,
under
some
decisions
of
this
court,
they
have
a
limited
fee
or
a
base
fee,
a
fee
of
simple
title
except
for
the
right
of
the
fees.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
if
they
didn't
complete
the
railroad
and
they
have
to
also
maintain
it
under
the
grant.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
government
contends
that
the
congress
isn't
bound
by
any
such
conveyancing
rules
as
to
the
form
of
the
state
under
general
principles
of
conveyancing.
it's
a
question
of
what
was
intended
by
the
congress
in
the
--
in
the
grant
and
the
purpose
of
the
grant,
what
congress
was
trying
to
accomplish.
and,
it's
contended
by
the
government
it's
very
plain
that
congress
didn't
want
to
grant
any
minerals
to
this
railroad
because
of
the
way
the
history
developed
and
the
way
it
expressly
provided
otherwise.
and,
therefore,
that
you
don't
have
to
reach
the
question
of
the
character
of
the
estate
and
that,
seems
to
us,
is
demonstrated
by
the
great
northern
case.
that
the
court
there
held
that
the
railroad
only
got
an
easement,
but
it
wasn't
necessary
to
the
decision
to
even
go
that
far
because
it
was
clear
from
the
history
that
it
was
never
intended
to
give
them
the
right
to
drill
for
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
now,
if
you
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
they
probably
wouldn't
because
the
difficulty
is
that
you
see
they
were
to
start
out
in
omaha
and
go
the
best
route
they
could
to
the
west,
straight
west
as
possible,
in
general
terms.
now,
that
is
so
general
and,
ordinarily,
it
would
be
construed
as
an
easement,
if
any
kind
of
a
right
was
passed.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
so,
then
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
they
had
a
very
large
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
discretion
about
putting
it
because
the
grant
was
just
not
as
explicit
as
later
grants.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
became
more
explicit,
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
justice.
there
were
several
things
involved
in
making
it
explicit
though,
and
one
of
them
was,
of
course,
as
to
the
line
itself.
as
soon
as
it
was
defined,
then
they
were
to
make
a
record
of
it
and
advise
the
government,
and
so
forth.
but
after
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
but,
after
that,
then,
those
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
they
were
to
advise
the
government
of
it
and,
i
presume,
it
was
implicit
that
there
would
be
a
general
approval.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
then,
even
after
that
though,
the
question
of
whether
the
mineral
lands
had
been
determined
depended
upon
whether
the
government
had
been
able
to
reach
all
of
that
problem
and
pass
upon
it
before
they
passed
the
lands
to
anybody
else.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
this
is
just
the
right
of
way
itself.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
so,
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
not
that
i
know
of.
they
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
that
there
was
never
any
intention
that
mineral
lands
on
the
railroad
be
granted
and
has
any
kind
of
a
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
fee
right
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
that
it
was
only
the
place
lands
because
there
was
no
need
for
that
type
of
grant
in
order
that
it
passed
this
railroad
through
the
country
and
be
able
to
maintain
--
construct
and
maintain
a
railroad
over
this
line.
but,
it
was
as
to
the
place
lands
that
there
was
a
need
for
this
action
to
determine
whether
they
were
mineral
lands
or
otherwise.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
right
of
way.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
except
for
one
thing.
i
have
to
qualify
that
further
because
of
the
subsequent
history.
there
was
an
amendment
in
1866
in
which
they
said
that
mineral
lands,
the
congress
said,
shall
not
include
iron
and
coal
in
the
definition.
but,
they
also
further
said
in
that
act
that
mineral
lands
shall
not
be
understood
to
be
conveyed
in
any
way
by
this
act,
in
which
they
amended
the
prior
act.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
only
further
thing
would
be
that
there
would
have
to
be
support
on
--
support
for
the
railroad
that
they
would
get
that
much
right
in
the
--
under
surface.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
so
far
as
i
know,
it
never
had
the
--
the
question
presented
to
it
as
far
as
whether
or
not
these
are
mineral
lands
as
such
because
that
didn't
apply,
according
to
the
government's
position,
to
the
right
of
way.
now,
the
question
has
come
up,
a
number
of
times,
as
to
whether
or
not
the
oil
and
gas
extraction
rights
on
the
right
of
way
were
within
the
grant.
and,
it's
been
the
consistent
position
of
the
government
for
50
years
in
any
number
of
decisions
that
--
that
there
was
no
such
grant
in
the
--
in
this
grant,
the
act
of
1862,
or
the
subsequent
grants
to
the
railroads.
and,
congress
has
passed
an
act
in
1930
in
which
it
said
that
all
such
rights
should
have
to
be
obtained
by
a
lease
and
it
belonged
to
the
government.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
1866
act
is
not.
i
have
it
before
me
and
i
can
quote
that
language
if
you'd
like.
“and,
the
term
“mineral
land,”
wherever
the
same
occurs
in
--
in
this
act
and
the
act
to
which
this
is
an
amendment,
shall
not
be
construed
to
include
coal
and
iron
lands.
and,
any
lands
granted
by
this
act
or
the
act
to
which
this
is
an
amendment
shall
not
defeat
or
impair
any
preemption,
homestead,
swamp
land,
or
other
lawful
claim
nor
include
any
government
reservation
or
mineral
lands,
or
the
improvements
of
any
bona
fide
settler
or
any
lands
returned
denominated
as
mineral
lands.”
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
but
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
think
that
is
a
guide
to
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
to
the
intention
of
congress
in
connection
with
the
matter.
but,
it
seems
to
me,
the
paramount
thought
of
the
court
in
dealing
with
this
problem
should
be
what
would
congress
intend
to
do
and
what
was
necessary
to
accomplish
what
they
were
after,
which
was
the
construction
of
this
railroad.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
the
legislative
history
and
also
the
history
of
the
times
which
is
treated
in
the
great
northern
and
also
in
a
number
of
the
cases
we
cite
indicating
that
--
including
the
mining
company
case
by
this
court
in
which
the
court
recognized
that
there
was
no
purpose
on
the
part
of
congress
to
make
conveyance
of
these
mineral
lands
and
transfer
them,
that
there
was
a
purpose
to
withhold
for
the
protection
of
the
interest
of
the
country.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
it
indicated
it
for
that
purpose.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
didn't
get
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
i
think
that's
where
it
turns
and,
also,
whether
or
not
you
need
to
have
oil
and
gas
back
in
1862
to
accomplish
the
purposes
of
--
that
congress
was
trying
to
accomplish
in
providing
for
the
construction
of
this
railroad.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right
and
that's
because
nobody
asked
for
it.
and,
it
also
seems
to
me,
it's
pretty
strong
evidence
against
any
claim
of
this
type
that
nobody
even
raised
the
question
for
as
long
as
they
did.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
it
was
about
50
years
later.
but,
i
do
think
they
are
--
they're
not
contemporaneous.
i
won't
claim
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
don't
think
it's
that
so
much,
although
that
could
contribute
to
it.
but,
even
when
you
think
that
it's,
even
today,
almost
100
years
later
that
this
question
comes
up
in
the
form
of
litigation,
the
fact
that
it
wasn't
even
raised
50
years
ago
and
we
don't
have
a
case
until
100
years
later,
it
seems
to
me,
pretty
important
as
to
how
reasonable
it
is
to
claim
that
gas
and
oil
was
intended
by
congress.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
the
--
the
area
involved
is
about
500,000
acres.
it's
9800
running
miles
of
right
of
way
and
about
50
acres
to
the
mile.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
my
understanding.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
it
could
apply
to
the
subsurface
without
any
question
and
i
think
that
congress
intended,
in
view
of
the
history
of
the
period,
to
reserve
the
minerals
and
was
trying
to
do
it
in
every
way
possible
and
that's
why
they
made
the
change
from
“section”
to
“act.”
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that
it
was
so
considered
by
congress
at
that
time
and
that
the
history
of
the
later
development
in
which
they
distinguished
between
surface
rights
and
mineral
rights
was
due
to
the
entirely
different
factor
of
trying
to
make
the
surface
available
to
settlers
and
that
they
were
trying
to
make
every
protection
they
could
for
the
minerals
of
this
country.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
--
it
would
apply
as
far
as
subsurface
rights
are
concerned.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
now,
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i'm
not
--
i
thought
your
question,
mr.
justice,
was
whether
or
not
that
was
our
sole
reliance.
it
is
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
is
not
our
sole
reliance.
we
think
that
the
history
of
period
is
a
very
important
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
now,
in
regard
to
that
same
matter,
counsel
answered
the
chief
justice
saying
that
there
was
--
the
reason
for
the
word
“act”
was
that
it
was
in
trying
to
provide
for
these
other
railroads
in
the
subsequent
sections,
but
if
you
--
and
that
they
didn't
want
to
have
to
repeat
that
statement
throughout
each
section
and
the
subsequent
sections
about
the
other
railroads.
but,
it
seems
to
me,
that
answer
is
inadequate
because,
as
i
had
already
described
in
my
prior
argument,
the
--
they
fully
said
that
these
--
the
earlier
provision
was
to
apply,
in
all
respects,
to
each
one
of
these
railroads.
and,
the
congress
didn't
see
fit
to
describe
the
grant
in
detail
in
the
subsequent
sections
at
all.
it
referred
back
to
the
prior
sections
to
find
out
what
the
grant
was.
now,
if
they're
going
to
look
there
for
the
grant,
they
certainly
shouldn't
have
to
worry
about
finding
the
same
provision
that
they're
using
in
“act”
to
apply
to
it.
so
that,
that
explanation
seems
entirely
inadequate
for
the
reason
for
putting
--
for
the
congress
going
through
the
procedure.
now,
if
the
house
had
only
put
in
“act”
in
the
first
place,
that
might
be
one
thing,
and
if
that's
all
the
history
of
it.
it
wouldn't
be
nearly
as
convincing,
at
least
to
me,
as
for
them
to
have
rejected
that
selected
section
and
then,
in
the
senate,
put
“act”
back
and
the
house
accepted
it.
it
shows
a
legislative
purpose
that
should
not
be
denied.
now,
counsel
has
also
suggested
that
the
congress
was
perfectly
willing
to
have
these
lands
made
available
for
mineral
rights,
the
mineral
lands,
to
the
public.
but,
this
court
has
dealt
with
that
very
problem
and
dealt
with
it
in
detail
concerning
the
history
of
these
times.
and,
in
the
decision
of
the
mining
company
case
in
1880
about
the
california
grant,
it
goes
into
detail
how
careful
congress
was
to
try
to
protect
these
minerals.
and,
it
said
“during
this
period,
or
from
1849
to
1866,
the
system
of
a
disposition
of
the
public
lands
in
general
had
to
be
introduced
in
california,”
and
grants
of
land
were
made
to
the
state
for
various
purposes,
also,
to
railroad
companies.
and,
in
all
these,
the
attention
of
congress
was
necessarily
turned
to
the
distinction
between
mineral
lands
and
the
ordinary
agricultural
lands
of
the
other
western
states
to
which
similar
laws
had
applied.
this
distinction
is
no
more
plainly
manifested
than
in
this
act
of
1853.
and,
it
goes
on
to
say,
“we
say
that
this
introduce
a
new
principle
and
preemption
for,
except
in
very
few
cases,
no
right
of
preemption
had
before
existed
until
the
lands
were
surveyed
so
that
the
preemptor
could
designate
by
the
description
of
the
congressional
survey
the
precise
land
to
which
this
preemption
test.”
but,
this
right
of
preemption
on
unsurveyed
lands
was,
by
this
statute,
to
last
but
one
year,
and
so
careful
was
congress
to
protect
mineral
lands
from
sale
and
preemption
that,
as
we
have
already
shown
by
the
proviso
of
section
3
of
the
act,
the
surveyors
were
forbidden
to
extend
their
surveys
over
them.
now,
i'd
like
to
say
one
word
about
the
400-foot
right
of
way
grant
in
section
2.
it
might
be
considered
that
that
is
a
lavish
grant
and,
therefore,
some
construction
should
be
made
from
that.
it
should
be
assumed
that
it
was
intended
by
congress
to
be
used
for
some
other
purpose
than
just
railroad
purposes.
but,
that
came
up
during
the
legislative
history
of
this
act,
and
the
motion
was
made
and
amendment
was
proposed
to
reduce
it
to
200
feet,
100
feet
on
each
side.
and,
it
was
then
explained
that
it
was
necessary
in
some
areas
of
the
mine
because
of
the
passes
and
the
difficulty
of
building
the
road
to
have
the
400
feet.
and,
therefore,
it
--
the
amendment
was
abandoned
and
they
left
it
at
the
400-foot
size,
but
it
was
because
it
was
claimed
that
it
was
needed
for
railroad
purposes
that
that
was
given.
now,
i'd
like
to
also
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
this
court
said
in
the
great
northern
railway
case
that
if
the
railroad
tried
to
get
a
right
of
way
by
eminent
domain,
it
got
nothing
but
an
easement,
which
seems
to
me
important
in
trying
to
construe
what
would
be
intended
in
a
situation
of
this
kind.
now,
the
government
doesn't
deny
that
a
very
valuable
part
of
the
inducement
of
this
building
of
this
railroad
was
this
right
of
way,
but
it
wasn't
the
gas
and
oil.
it
wasn't
the
gold
or
the
silver
or
any
precious
minerals
that
were
involved.
the
inducement
was
the
fact
that
you
just
couldn't
get
a
right
of
way
across
the
lands
of
the
united
states
unless
it
was
granted
to
you.
you
can't
get
anything
like
that
by
eminent
domain.
and,
therefore,
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
they
get
such
a
right
in
order
to
build
the
railroad,
but
they
were
interested
and
it
was
a
vital
importance
politically
and
to
the
war
itself
that
was
going
on
that
this
railroad
be
built.
but,
in
spite
of
such
client,
the
congress
was
careful
to
try
to
protect
the
country
in
regard
to
these
mineral
rights.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
it
is,
insofar
as
it
was
necessary
to
the
holding
in
a
particular
case,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
was
trying
to
solve
that
problem
and
it
--
and
then,
went
back
to
the
general
law
or
language
of
conveyance
instead
of
directing
its
attention
to
what
the
intent
of
the
congress
was
in
the
specific
act
and
what
they
were
trying
to
accomplish,
as
this
court
has
done
over
the
years
in
trying
to
construe
congressional
acts.
and,
if
they
did
that,
you
wouldn't
have
to
characterize
the
estate
in
any
way
in
order
to
give
the
protection
that
was
necessary
in
each
of
those
cases
in
order
to
maintain
the
railroad.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and,
i
argue
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
one
of
them
was
a
case
of
adverse
possession
question
and
the
other
was
whether
or
not
the
united
states
could
convey
part
of
the
right
of
way.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
but
they
didn't
involve
the
question
of
whether
these
minerals
are
oil
and
gas
rights
or
mineral
rights
were
passed
or
to
be
with
--
or
reserved
by
the
congress.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
and
i
point
to
the
great
northern
case
as
one
which
this
court
did
do
the
very
thing
of
looking
to
see
what
the
intentions
--
intention
of
congress
was,
what
the
history
of
the
moment
was,
the
history
of
the
whole
period
was,
and
whether,
under
all
of
that,
it
was
intended
to
pass
oil
and
gas
rights.
it
found
that
they
did.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
that's
right.
