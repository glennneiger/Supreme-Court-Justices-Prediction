e.
whittaker
do
you
happen
to
know
anything
about
the
mineral
--
if
there
was
a
method
of
getting
mineral
lands,
was
it
not
about
this
time?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
there
is
congressional
enactment
for
it,
wasn't
there?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
excuse
me,
mr.
clary.
let
me
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
do
you
call
the
atlantic
and
pacific
case?
what's
--
what's
the
name
of
the
case?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
those
decisions
say
whether,
in
the
event
of
abandonment,
title
is
reacquired
only
upon
reentry
or
automatically?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
there
are
distinctions.
as
i
recall
it
from
law
school,
the
possibility
of
reverter
is
one
thing
but
a
right
of
reentry
for
conditions
broken
is
another.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
it
could
lease,
apparently,
to
oil
companies
to
do
this?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
suppose
that
--
suppose
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
suppose
an
issue
of
interference
with
a
proper
conduct
for
the
railroad
should
be
raised
merely
from
the
fact
that
you
made
the
lease,
and
the
government
part
by
the
extent
of
the
operations
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
by
the
oil
company
under
the
lease,
then,
what
happens?
