justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
tell
us
the
date
of
those
granting
acts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
california
and
utah.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
a
body
of
the
act
in
other
--
other
than
those
two
grants
to
the
states
from
which
you
are
arguing
a
pattern
and
--
withholding
it
did
not
require
explicit
as
to
the
expression
of
the
parties?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
withholding,
did
that
mean
by
a
specific
--
by
exquisite
reservation
or
that
reservation
was
implied
merely
by
what
is
granted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
would
involve
it
indicated
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
how
such
a
statute,
where
you
quickly
prevail,
raise
and
unfold
on
the
reservation.
they
just
wanted
to
mark
it
up
and
infer
the
disposition,
certainly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and,
here,
you
derive
the
reservation
from
your
facts
that
the
land,
the
mineral
will
grow,
if
they
would,
and
the
grant
would
merely
do.
you're
restricted
to
the
face
of
the
grant.
there's
nothing
beneath
or
above
it,
is
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
your
argument
is
that
there
wasn't
an
implied
conveyance
of
a
fee.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
it
gets
down
to,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
proper
to
add
that
--
is
it
appropriate
to
add,
in
addition
to
what
you
said,
that
what
they
got
--
what
mineral
lands
were
conveyed
was
determined,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
by
the
landowners
and
the
interior
department?
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
it
was
or
wasn't
mineral
land,
it
was
an
administrative
determination
on
section
3
of
the
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
statute
itself
neither
defined
nor
limited
what
mineral
--
what
was
conveyed
by
mineral
lands,
either
technical
or
whatever
you
call
them,
technological
matters
that
left
to
be
assumed,
just
as
it
would
assume
knowledge
of
the
department
of
the
interior
as
the
landowners
upon
such
land,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
would
come
before
it,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
agree?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
agree
that
a
good
way
to
start
is
to
read
section
2
and
3?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
agree
that
a
good
way
to
start
with
this
problem
is
to
read
section
2
and
3,
and
see
what
they
direct
themselves
to?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
territory
is
involved
by
the
issue
that
is
now
before
us?
what
--
what's
the
scope
of
the
area?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
in
this
case
alone.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that
the
claim
that
is
now
before
us,
as
been
recognized
below,
was
not
made
until
this
suit
was
started?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
places
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
production
in
the
right
of
way?
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
production
of
oil
and
minerals?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
the
--
mr.
clary,
would
the
--
if
the
right
of
way
--
if
the
road
has
to
go
through
mineral
lands
that
wasn't,
and
crosses
the
injunction,
would
the
minerals
that
meets
the
right
of
way
also
go
to
the
railroad?
justice
felix
frankfurter
take
your
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
it's
a
general
proposition,
but
if
--
as
i
also
understand,
unless
you
correct
me,
that
it
may
have
a
right
of
way
over
what
is
--
what
are
mineral
lands
and,
therefore,
excepted
by
section
3
--
by
the
proviso
of
section
3.
in
that
stretch
of
the
right
of
way,
would
the
right
of
way
grant
carry
with
it
the
minerals?
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
it's
mineral
land
or
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
comment
in
for
one
or
two
more
decisions,
mr.
clary.
restricting
myself
entirely
to
what
you
claim
under
section
2,
the
right
of
way,
did
the
secretary
of
the
interior
claim
any
part
at
all
in
the
formalities
of
the
grant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
he
grant
formally
a
formal
document?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
where
--
is
the
grant
expressed
in
a
formal
document?
and,
if
so,
where
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
you
do
is
you
draw
the
line
and
that's
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
grant,
do
you
mean
what
the
statute
gave
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
has
become
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
becomes
a
section
as
soon
as
you
drew
the
line.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
are
no
legal
documents
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
may
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
that
may
include
land
which,
in
another
connection,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
found
to
be
mineral
land.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
follow.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
place
lands.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
it
filed
out?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
he
have
to
approve
of
the
land?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that,
what
it
really
means
is
this
is
what
congress
has
written
in
section
2
and
you're
the
master
of
turning
it
into
reality,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
section
--
congress
granted
this
act
in
1862
and
gave
you
whatever
rights
regarding
the
section
2,
and
you
determine
what
those
rights
are,
typically
speaking.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
--
i
mean,
you
determine
where
they
are.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
fixed
by
what
then?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
our
question,
the
problem
before
the
court,
and
this
is
a
fair
statement,
the
problem
before
the
court
is
to
construe
section
2
with
such
aids
to
construction
as
are
appropriate
for
the
court
in
determining
what
the
statute
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
it
disturb
the
plain
order
of
your
argument
if
you
went
straight
to
the
point
that
they
said
you
were
coming
and,
in
answer
to
chief
justice's
question,
you
gave
us
an
ambiguous
answer
and
said,
“and
the
decisions
of
this
court
so
held.”
would
you
mind
coming
to
that,
by
the
way?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
don't,
if
your
order
of
argument
suggests
another.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
if
that's
so,
then
it's
the
property
that
matters,
we
often
observe
what
we
previously
held
of
our
other
decisions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
clary.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
i
hope
i'm
not
pressing
too
much.
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
relief
of
this
land
or
apportionment
of
this
land
are
and
may
be,
by
the
railroad,
put
to
use
for
other
uses,
at
least
in
one
part,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and,
now,
in
the
townsend
case,
which
i've
know
read
for
the
first
time
and
it's
been
uncommonly
short
opinion
by
mr.
justice
white,
they
might
be
a
little
short.
i
learned
from
that,
they
couldn't
--
the
railroad
could
not
alienate
it
because
that
would
be
to
make
a
just
use
of
the
grant.
it
may
grant
its
own
purpose.
it
may
consider
this
for
99
years
or
what
we
--
what
ultimately
make
the
railroad
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
selling?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
in
99
years.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and,
if
these
other
uses
to
which
you
referred
earlier
are
its
own
businesses?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
they
may
be
anything
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
be
the
case
that
troubles
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
one
more
question
before
you
sit
down,
mr.
solicitor.
i've
read,
i
think,
all
the
cases
on
which
reliance
is
placed,
and
i
think,
if
i
may
say
so,
you
are
quite
right
in
saying
that
not
one
of
them
exists
in
this
recite
--
in
this
recited
issue,
the
adjudication.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
also
impressed
by
the
fact,
in
reading
your
assertion,
that
various
judges,
various
members
of
this
court,
and
at
least
one
or
two
congresses,
with
land
problems
more
particularly
on
mind,
so
that
this
particular
problem
did
characterize
this,
what
was
different
in
section
2
has
a
grant
which
is,
in
scope,
very
different
from
a
mere
right
of
passage.
indeed,
in
one
of
the
opinions
which
mr.
justice
makes
the
distinction
between
a
mere
right
of
passage
and
easement
to
a
natural
person
and
what
was
given
here
to
the
railroad
for
public
purpose.
what
i
would
like
to
ask
of
you
is
whether
such
--
if
such
a,
what
shall
i
say,
an
additive
for
this
grant
by
judges
when
their
minds
weren't
on
it
but
they
read
the
statute
innocent,
whether
that
is
already
--
already
an
important
language
and
weighty
testimony
or
as
i
come
to
reading
this
statute
in
the
light
of
urging
that
it's
certainly
time
to
try
and
find
out
what
the
interests
are.
justice
felix
frankfurter
anything
could
do,
36
in
number
there.
