mr.
william
w.
clary
may
it
please
the
court.
right
at
the
start,
i
would
like
to
further
come
to
the
solicitor
general's
last
comment
that
the
claim
wasn't
made
until
100
years
later.
as
we
look
at
it,
the
shoe
is
entirely
on
the
other
foot.
the
government
never
claimed
this
until
100
years
later.
the
union
pacific
has
only
assumed
that
it
owned
this
right
of
way
and
has
dealt
with
it
as
an
owner.
and,
there
is
a
finding
in
the
record
which
is
not
challenged
that,
in
making
leases
of
apportions
of
its
right
of
way,
presently
not
needed
for
railroad
purposes,
it
had
always
reserved
the
right
to
cancel
the
lease
in
order
to
develop
oil
and
gas,
that
that's
been
a
very
long
standing
practice.
mr.
william
w.
clary
on
the
right
of
way
land.
so
that,
the
facts
are
that
the
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
it's
on
page
13
of
the
record,
finding
number
8.
no,
that
is
--
yes,
finding
number
9.
so
that,
the
facts
are
that
this
case
arises
because
the
government,
after
100
years
or
nearly
100
years,
for
the
first
time,
has
claimed,
as
far
as
the
union
pacific
knows,
that
it
now
owned
or
had
a
right
to
take
the
minerals
out
from
under
the
union
pacific
right
of
way.
mr.
william
w.
clary
it
is
a
strip
of
land,
your
honor,
400
feet
in
width,
as
so
defined
in
section
2
of
the
act.
mr.
william
w.
clary
in
the
early
days,
conveyances
were
made
and
they
were
held
invalid
in
some
of
the
early
cases,
and
there
have
been
congressional
statutes
validating
those.
but,
after
the
case
of
townsend
versus
northern
pacific,
which
held
that
the
right
of
way
was
inalienable
and
could
not
be
acquired
by
adverse
possession
or
by
grant,
there
have
been
no
such
conveyances.
mr.
william
w.
clary
yes.
mr.
william
w.
clary
it's
a
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
--
common
practice,
the
matter,
i
might
say,
i
think
i
may
safely
say
of
common
knowledge.
anyone
riding
on
a
railroad
may
see
that
it
was
within
the
400
strip.
the
portions
of
the
right
of
way
which
are
not
immediately
needed
for
railroad
purposes
are
used
for
a
variety
of
other
usage.
some
of
them
contribute
to
railroad
operations
and
many
do
not.
everything
from
motor
courts
and
signboards
and
things
of
that
sort,
residents
are
--
and
their
lease
for
profit
had
never
been
considered
that
that
is
a
violation
of
the
condition
upon
which
the
right
of
way
was
granted.
of
course,
those
things
are
--
do
not
interfere
with
the
operation
of
the
road
and
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
w.
clary
yes,
your
honor.
this
is
the
main
line
right
of
way.
mr.
william
w.
clary
well,
there
are
many
branch
lines.
mr.
william
w.
clary
but,
the
question
that's
involved
here,
in
a
strictly
technical
sense,
is
--
is
only
80
acres.
the
principal
may
involve
the
entire
thousand
miles
right
of
way.
we're
aware
of
that.
but,
the
case
arises
over
an
attempt
by
the
union
pacific
to
drill
for
oil
upon
one
small
segment
of
its
right
of
way
in
the
state
of
wyoming,
adjoining
which,
the
united
states
has
the
mineral
rights
to
80
acres
of
land.
and,
the
united
states
claims
that
it
has
the
mineral
right
under
that
piece
of
right
of
way
and
seeks
to
enjoin
the
drilling
of
that
particular
well.
that
is
the
precise
question.
of
course,
we
have
the
broader
implications
of
--
to
--
of
the
principles
which
may
be
established.
mr.
william
w.
clary
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
william
w.
clary
so
far
as
i
know,
there
is
none
at
this
time
on
the
union
pacific
right
of
way.
i
suspect
there
is
on
other
railroad
rights
of
way.
mr.
william
w.
clary
the
union
pacific,
as
far
as
i
know,
has
never
drilled
any
--
or
any
oil
on
its
right
of
way
until
this
attempt.
this,
of
course,
was
--
was
temporarily
stopped
by
this
suit.
now,
i
think
that,
in
regard
to
some
of
the
question
that
had
been
asked,
might
--
i
might
be
able
to
clarify
the
situation
if
i
point
out
that,
in
our
view,
there
are
two
separate
and
distinct
grants
made
in
this
act.
the
grant
by
section
2
was
a
grant
of
a
strip
of
land
400-feet
wide.
it's
for
a
named
purpose,
namely,
the
construction
of
a
right
of
way.
well,
i
will
discuss
later
the
authorities
which
we
maintain,
hold,
and
determine
that
that
is
a
grant
of
a
fee.
the
other
grant
which
is
entirely
separate
is
a
grant
of
lands,
alternate
sections
on
either
side
of
the
road,
which
are
called
place
lands
because
there
were
indefinite
limits,
i
suppose.
and,
those
grants
are
made
in
the
same
act
but
in
a
separate
section.
now,
as
to
those
grants
of
these
place
lands
entirely
outside
the
400-foot
strip,
there
is
no
doubt
but
that
there
is
a
--
an
exception
of
mineral
lands
from
those
place
lands.
that
exception
has
been
given
effect
consistently
in
this
way.
under
the
act,
after
a
certain
time,
a
railroad
is
entitled
to
receive
a
patent
to
those
place
lands.
it
is
the
administrative
duty
of
the
department
of
the
interior
to
determine
before
the
issuance
of
the
patent
whether
or
not
they
are
mineral
lands.
if
they
are
mineral
lands,
no
patent
was
issued
and
that,
of
course,
has
happened
in
many
instances.
if
--
if
they
are
not
determined
to
be
mineral
lands,
the
department
of
the
interior
issues
a
patent
under
a
well
set
of
principles
of
law
and
decisions
of
this
court.
if
after
the
patent
issues,
minerals
should
be
found
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
they
were
considered
non-mineral,
the
--
the
entire
title
has
vested
by
the
patent
and
it
--
the
united
states
can't
take
back
the
minerals.
that
was
the
decision
in
the
pleading
case
of
burke
versus
southern
pacific,
which
i'll
cite
a
little
later.
mr.
william
w.
clary
well,
they've
been
issued
over
a
period
of
many
years,
your
honor.
mr.
william
w.
clary
well,
the
first
thing
that
was
done
was
that
the
railroad
laid
out
its
line
of
track
and
then,
answering
your
question,
there
were
no
specific
restriction
as
to
where
it
might
go,
except
there
were
termini.
it
had
to
start
at
a
place
on
the
missouri
on
the
100th
meridian
which
will
be
designated
by
the
president
of
the
united
states,
and
was
so
designated.
and,
it
had
to
connect
--
it
had
to
go
to
the
pacific
coast
and
it
was
suppose
to
connect
with
the
central
pacific
railroad
which
it
was
building
eastward
from
california,
and
it
did
connect
with
the
central
pacific
at
a
place
known
as
promontory
point
in
utah
in
1869.
the
--
this
same
act
granted
the
central
pacific
a
similar
right
of
way
in
place
lands.but,
between
those
points,
there
was
no
restriction
as
to
where
the
lines
would
be
built,
except
section
8
of
the
act
which
provided
that
the
line
must
go
in
the
most
direct
and
practicable,
i
believe
the
words
are
“the
most
direct
and
practicable
route
--
continuous
route.”
as
we
said
here
this
morning,
it
couldn't
go
around
mineral
lands
or
it
couldn't
jump
over
mineral
lands.
it
had
to
cross
mineral
lands
when
it
came
to
them,
and
the
government
here
has
frankly
conceded
that
the
exception
of
mineral
land,
which
is
found
in
section
3
of
the
act
and
as
to
which
they
talk
about
the
mineral
policy,
cannot
possibly
apply
to
the
right
of
way
because
you
cannot
accept
lands
out
of
a
railroad
right
of
way
and
have
a
railroad.
mr.
william
w.
clary
well,
our
position
is,
and
i
--
i'm
coming
to
that
now
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
--
that
the
grant
of
the
right
of
way
was
a
grant
of
a
fee
and,
therefore,
the
minerals
in
the
right
of
way
pass
with
the
fee.
mr.
william
w.
clary
we
think
it
would,
your
honor,
very
definitely
and
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
we
think
whether
it
was
mineral
or
not,
and
we
think
the
decisions
clearly
support
that.
mr.
william
w.
clary
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
william
w.
clary
when
the
act
was
passed,
the
railroad,
and
this
was
amended
in
1864
in
order
to
increase
the
place
lands,
it
was
provided
that,
in
section
4
of
the
act,
that
if
it
should
appear
that
40
consecutive
miles
of
said
railroad
and
telegraph
line
had
been
--
had
been
completed
and
equipped
in
all
respects
as
required
by
the
act,
then
upon
the
certificate
of
the
commissioners
who
are
appointed
for
the
government,
happens
--
should
issue
conveying
the
right
and
title
to
the
said
land
to
said
company.
in
other
words,
the
patents
were
supposed
to
issue
as
each
40
miles
was
completed.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
do
not
think
that
actually
happened.
many
of
them
were
delayed
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
--
because
of
the
determination
of
whether
it
was
mineral
or
homestead
or
whether
there
were
exceptions
or
reservations
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
--
but
that
is
the
factor.
mr.
william
w.
clary
well,
there
was
supposed
to
have
been
a
decision
before
the
patent
was
issued
as
to
whether
it
was
mineral
land.
if
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
well,
the
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
the
decisions
--
the
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
nothing
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
when
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
when
the
railroad
applied
for
a
patent
under
the
clause
which
i
read,
it
was
the
duty
of
the
secretary
under
the
law
to
determine
whether
the
land
was
of
the
kind
to
which
a
patent
should
issue,
whether
it
was
mineral
or
non-mineral,
or
whether
it
was
reserved.
now,
that
is
found
in
the
general
duties
and
conscience
of
the
secretary.
in
the
case
of
burke
that
i
mentioned,
as
specifically
held
that
it
was
the
function
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
--
to
make
that
determination
before
he
issued
the
patent.
but,
once
the
patent
was
issued,
that's
final,
title
passes
and
nothing
is
reserved
and
there's
no
policy
of
reservation
of
any
minerals
and
patents
as
the
solicitor
general
has
said
in
title
of
1909.
mr.
william
w.
clary
the
railroad
it's
--
of
course,
there
had
been
three
surveys
of
transcontinental
routes
made
during
the
1950s,
but
they're
--
the
--
after
the
act
was
passed,
the
railroad
had
to
survey
and
actually
locate
the
precise
line,
and
it
did
so.
mr.
william
w.
clary
that
was
the
400
feet.
mr.
william
w.
clary
they
located
the
center
line
of
that.
mr.
william
w.
clary
about
two
years,
if
i
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
there
are
decisions
of
the
courts
on
that
which
hold
that
we
acquired
it
either
at
the
date
of
the
grant
or
at
the
date
of
the
filing
of
that
exact
line.
we
say
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
in
the
case.
that
is
in
the
stewart
case.
in
the
case
of
missouri,
kansas,
and
texas
versus
roberts,
it
was
definitely
settled
that
the
right
of
way
passed
to
the
railroad
at
least
“upon
the
construction
of
the
road,
if
not
earlier.”
that's
as
close
as
i
can
answer
your
question.
although
the
grant
is
commonly
spoken
of
by
the
courts
as
a
grant
in
praesenti,
upholding
grant
which
became
definite
upon
the
location
of
this
line
or,
if
not
then,
upon
the
actual
construction
of
the
railroad
which
was
completed
in
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
i
don't
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
--
i
think
it
is,
your
honor.
merely,
it
--
it
merely
explains
the
structure
of
the
act,
but
--
but
this
matter
of
patenting
of
the
patents
of
the
alternate
sections,
we
say,
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
right
of
way
and
the
rights
acquired
under
it.
mr.
william
w.
clary
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
william
w.
clary
the
grant
itself
conveyed
the
title.
mr.
william
w.
clary
there
is
no
formal
document
here.
mr.
william
w.
clary
the
decisions
of
the
courts,
which
i
would
like
to
cite
in
a
few
minutes,
hold
that
the
grant
itself
was
the
conveyance.
the
grant
is
better
than
the
document.
mr.
william
w.
clary
yes,
i
mean
section
2.
mr.
william
w.
clary
that's
the
grant.
mr.
william
w.
clary
that
is
a
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
that
is
right.
mr.
william
w.
clary
it's
a
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
none
whatever.
it's
a
legislative
grant.
it's
a
grant
by
acts
of
the
legislature
in
which
the
granting
words
“be”
and
“are
hereby
granted”
are
used
right
in
the
statute.
the
court
said
when
those
words
are
used,
title
pass.
mr.
william
w.
clary
as
soon
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
that's
certainly
true
because
the
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
--
the
land
in
the
other
connection
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
--
is
in
the
place
lands.
mr.
william
w.
clary
that
is
right.
as
soon
as
the
survey
--
as
the
actual
survey
of
the
road
is
completed,
which
i
think
took
about
two
years,
a
map
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
that
was
filed
with
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
a
map
of
the
definite
location
of
the
road
was
filed,
i
think,
in
about
two
years.
mr.
william
w.
clary
the
law
didn't
require
him
to
approve
it.
but,
then
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
i
don't
know
if
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
william
w.
clary
well,
we
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
we
determine
where
they
are
by
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
--
but
the
termini,
as
i
said,
are
fixed.
mr.
william
w.
clary
by
the
statute,
so
that
there
couldn't
be
--
and
the
general
route
had
to
follow
--
it
had
to
go
from
a
point
on
the
100th
meridian
somewhere
near
omaha
to
san
francisco
and
--
so
that
there
wasn't
so
much
leeway
as
they
might
think,
but
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
i
think
that
is
right;
whether
section
2,
as
we
maintain,
granted
the
fee
or
limited
fee
which
included
the
minerals.
we
maintain
that
it
did.
mr.
william
w.
clary
yes,
your
honor,
in
the
sense
that
there
was
a
specific
exception
of
mineral
lands
in
section
3.
mr.
william
w.
clary
without
any
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
--
without
any
exception
or
reservations,
and
that
is
what
this
court
has
held.
we
--
that's
what
we
base
our
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
no,
no
patent
was
ever
issued
with
the
right
of
way
lands.
mr.
william
w.
clary
well,
we
--
it
was
located
by
the
survey
but
the
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
it
had
to
be
approved
before
the
patent
was
issued.
mr.
william
w.
clary
well,
i
might
have
to
--
had
to
prove
them,
but
they
were
built
each
40
miles.
mr.
william
w.
clary
we
didn't
know
whether
the
secretary
would
--
would
approve
that.
the
commissioners
would
approve
it,
of
course,
until
they
had
approved
it
but,
as
each
40
miles
progressed,
why,
patents
were
issued.
whereas,
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
and
that's
what
made
it
finally
definite,
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
w.
clary
i'd
be
very
glad
to.
mr.
william
w.
clary
well
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
the
--
we
based
that
conclusion
on
--
on
three
different
arguments.
one
is
the
general
historical
background
of
this
grant,
which
i
had
planned
to
discuss
first.
the
second
is
the
decisions
of
this
court,
which
i
mentioned.
and,
the
third
is
the
mineral
policy
of
the
united
states,
which
we
believe
supports
our
position.
now,
that
was
the
order
in
which
i
had
planned
to
present
the
case
and,
if
there's
time,
i
would
like
to
present
something
on
each
of
those
three
points.
speaking,
first,
of
the
historical
background
of
this
act,
it's
important
to
consider
that
the
year
1871
was
the
dividing
point
in
the
history
of
railroad
land
grants.
it
was
the
end
of
one
era
and
the
beginning
of
another.
the
objectives
of
railroad
legislation
prior
to
1871
were
succinctly
described
in
the
classic
work
entitled
railroad
transportation
by
arthur
twining
hadley,
the
president
of
yale
university
in
1885.
and,
he
said
that
early
railroad
legislation
in
the
united
states
was
devised
for
the
object
of
securing
railroad
construction.
the
only
theory
was
that
the
railroad
would
not
be
billed
as
fast
as
they
were
needed.
now,
it
was
in
order
to
meet
that
need
that
these
combined
grants
which
began
in
the
1950s
with
illinois
central
grant,
combining
a
grant
of
land
for
a
right
of
way
and
place
lands
to
help
finance
the
road,
was
begun.
that
was
the
beginning
of
the
policy.
the
first
of
these
grants
was
the
illinois
central
grant
of
1850.i
should
say,
however,
that
that
was
a
grant,
as
--
as
counsel
has
said,
to
the
state
of
illinois
but
it
was
on
behalf
of
the
illinois
central
railroad.
and,
the
grant
which
the
court
construed
in
illinois
central
case
in
the
--
in
the
seventh
circuit
was
the
grant
from
the
united
states
to
the
state
of
illinois
which
is,
of
course,
the
basis
of
illinois'
title.
illinois
then
transferred
the
property
to
the
illinois
central
railway.
it
was
that
grant
which
the
court
of
appeals
held
conveyed
the
right
of
way
and
fee
together
with
the
minerals.
now,
when
it
came
to
the
time
of
the
civil
war,
it
was
obvious
that
a
transcontinental
railroad
was
a
necessity,
a
political
and
military
necessity,
to
connect
california
with
the
rest
of
the
union.
and,
there
were
many
intelligent
people
at
that
time
who
thought
that
a
railroad
over
the
rocky
mountains
and
the
sierra
nevada
was
an
impossibility,
that
the
difficulties
would
be
insurmountable.
i
think
it's
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
purpose
of
the
union
pacific
grant
was
to
induce
people
to
engage
in
this
then
hazardous
enterprise.
and,
this
act
should
be
construed
with
that
purpose
in
mind,
with
the
idea
that
the
purpose
of
congress
was
to
induce
people
to
engage
in
this
enterprise,
and
the
first
act
was
insufficient
to
accomplish
that
end.
and,
in
1864,
they
had
to
increase
the
place
lands
before
it
was
finally
accomplished.
now,
it's
been
held
with
the
court,
i
will
cite
in
a
moment,
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
present
case
held
that
the
inclusion
of
the
right
of
way
in
this
grant
was
an
important
part
of
this
inducement.
it
was
in
the
late
of
this
historical
background
and
in
view
of
this
purpose
that
this
court
said
in
the
great
northern
case,
which
involved
the
later
act,
that
when
congress
made
outright
grants
of
alternate
section
and
along
with
the
grants
of
the
right
of
way,
it
was
not
surprising
that
the
courts
had
held
that
the
right
of
way
conveyed
these
grants
as
limited
fees.
but,
the
policy
which
led
to
this
conclusion
that
these
were
limited
fees
was
radically
changed
in
1871.
again,
to
quote
hadley,
“the
reaction
between
1870
and
1873
was
sudden
and
widespread.”
that
reaction
was
brought
about,
as
the
solicitor
general
said
in
part,
by
a
pressure
of
homesteaders
who
wanted
to
take
up
these
lands
and,
as
a
result,
congress
passed
a
resolution
in
1872
that
there
would
be
no
more
place
land
grants
to
railroads.
another,
perhaps
more
important,
reason
was
that
by
1872
or
by
1875,
the
main
transcontinental
routes
had
already
been
laid
out
and
provided
for
by
grants
and
there
was
no
need
for
these
inducements
on
place
land
and
other
grants.
however,
that
--
that
was
when
the
court
came
to
the
great
northern
case.
they
were
construing
the
act
of
1875.
the
court,
in
that
case,
accepted
the
premise,
which
i'll
state,
that
the
grants
prior
to
1871
conveyed
limited
fees
in
the
rights
of
way.
and,
they
found
that,
because
of
the
change
of
policy
and
because
of
the
particular
provisions
which
were
mentioned
by
the
solicitor
general,
that
only
an
easement
was
conveyed.
one
of
those
provisions
is
particularly
significant,
i
mean,
of
the
act
of
1875.
that
was
the
provision
at
the
location
of
each
right
of
way.
it
should
be
noted
on
the
plaque
in
the
local
land
office
and,
thereafter,
any
homesteader
could
acquire
title
to
the
land
subject
to
the
right
of
passage
of
the
railroad
which,
obviously,
has
characteristics
of
an
easement.
but,
the
point
that
we
make
here
is
that
this
type
of
limitation
and
all
the
other
practice
which
led
the
court
to
conclude
that
the
1875
act
conveyed
only
an
easement
are
totally
absent
from
the
1862
act.
the
1862
act
made
a
present
absolute
grant
in
granting
language
of
a
strip
of
land
400
feet
wide
subject
to
no
condition
or
limitation
except
that
the
railroad
be
built
and
operated.it
was
not
a
grant,
in
general
terms,
to
permit
anyone
to
construct
the
railroad
anywhere,
as
was
the
1875
act,
but
it
was
a
grant
to
a
designated
grantee
to
procure
the
construction
of
the
railroad
between
certain
designated
points.
now,
i
come
to
the
cases
which
your
honor
suggested
that
i
refer
to.
the
court
of
appeals,
in
the
present
case,
noted
that
the
extent
of
the
estate
conveyed
in
the
right
of
way
in
the
pre-1871
grant
has
been
before
the
court
many
times
and
it
cited
seven
decisions
of
this
court
as
being
the
most
important.
i
believe
that
there
were
seven
in
this
court
or
perhaps
six
to
this
court
and,
plus,
the
illinois
central
case.
the
court
of
appeals
summed
up
the
holdings
of
these
decisions
by
saying
that,
considering
the
time
and
circumstances,
the
history
which
i've
outlined,
it
must
be
held
that
congress
intended
to
convey
a
limited
fee
upon
the
implied
condition
of
reverter
to
the
united
states
in
the
event
the
company
seized
to
use
or
retain
the
land
for
the
purposes
for
which
it
was
granted.
that
was
the
only
limitation.
now,
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
necessary
nor
is
there
time
for
me
to
discuss
all
seven
of
these
cases,
but
there
are
two
or
three
of
them
that
i
would
like
to
mention
specifically.
one
is
the
case
of
new
mexico
versus
united
states
trust
company.
in
that
case
--
that
case
involved
a
grant
to
the
atlantic
and
pacific
railroad
company
of
1866.
i
believe
that,
later,
became
santa
fe.
it
is
practically
identical
with
the
union
pacific
grant.
however,
it
had
a
provision
in
it
which
excepted
the
right
of
way
from
taxation
within
the
territory.
the
territory
of
new
mexico
claimed
that
the
right
of
way
was
an
easement
and,
therefore,
the
buildings
and
structures
upon
it
could
be
taxed
as
personal
property.
so,
the
power
of
the
territory
to
tax
was
held
to
depend
on
the
nature
of
the
estate
granted,
that
is,
whether
it
was
a
fee
or
an
easement.
the
court
held
that
the
grant
was
a
grant
of
the
land
itself,
not
of
a
mere
right
of
passage.
it
based
this
upon
the
earlier
case
of
missouri,
kansas,
and
texas
--
it
based
it,
in
part,
on
the
earlier
case
of
missouri,
kansas,
and
texas
versus
roberts
in
152
u.s.in
which
the
court,
in
passing
on
a
similar
grant,
decided
specifically
that
it
conveyed
the
fee.
but,
here
is
the
interesting
thing
about
the
new
mexico
case.
new
mexico
claimed
that,
in
the
roberts
case,
the
distinction
between
a
fee
and
easement
had
not
been
raised
and,
therefore,
it
presumed
that
i
would
think
they
--
to
suggest
that
the
supreme
court
had
overlooked
it.
but,
the
court
held
that
the
issue
of
title
was
involved
in
the
roberts
case
and
said
pointedly
that
the
difference
between
an
easement
and
a
fee
would
not
have
escaped
the
attention
of
the
author
of
the
opinion
and
that
of
the
whole
court
with
the
inevitable
consequences
which
would
depend
upon
such
a
difference.
of
course,
the
court
knew
what
the
different
consequences
that
would
follow
from
a
fee
or
an
easement.
and,
in
the
new
mexico
case,
it
was
held
that
a
consequence
of
fee
ownership
that
the
improvements
became
a
part
of
the
realty
and,
hence,
were
not
taxable
as
personal
property.
and
so,
in
the
present
case,
by
the
same
token,
the
minerals
are
a
part
of
the
--
of
the
realty
and
passed
with
the
fee.
another
case
i
would
mention
briefly
is
the
case
of
clairmont
versus
the
united
states
in
225
u.s.551.
i
merely
want
to
quote
one
sentence
from
this
case,
which
was
written
by
mr.
justice
hughes
speaking
for
the
entire
court.
this
had
reference
to
the
northern
pacific
right
of
way
which
is
practically
identical
with
the
union
pacific
right
of
way
act.
mr.
justice
hughes
said,
and
i
want
to
quote
his
exact
words,
“by
the
grant
of
congress,
the
railroad
company
obtained
the
fee
in
the
land
constituting
the
right
of
way.”
with
all
respect
to
the
solicitor
general,
i
frankly
do
not
understand
how,
in
his
brief,
he
can
brush
aside
so
lightly
this
very
forthright
statement.
i
cannot
help
but
think
that
when
mr.
justice
hughes
used
these
familiar
legal
expressions,
he
meant
them
in
their
true
legal
sense.
mr.
william
w.
clary
the
controversy
was
the
question
whether
the
--
a
person
arrested
on
a
train
of
the
northern
pacific
was
within
indian
country
or
not
within
indian
country.
and,
if
he
was
--
if
the
right
of
way
was
held
solely
as
an
easement,
it
would
have
been
within
the
indian
country.
i'm
not
saying,
your
honor,
that
--
that
this
was
the
holding
in
the
case.
i
was
careful
to
say
that
it
was
a
statement
of
mr.
justice
hughes
but,
as
such,
to
me,
it
carries
a
very
great
deal
of
weight.
now,
the
one
other
case
that
i
would
like
to
discuss
is
northern
pacific
versus
townsend
in
190
u.s.267.
this
case
involved
the
right
of
way
granted
to
the
northern
pacific,
which
i
just
mentioned,
involved
the
question
whether
a
title
to
a
question
of
the
right
of
way
could
be
acquired
by
adverse
possession.
the
court
held
that
the
decision
turned
upon
the
nature
of
the
estate
granted
in
the
act
of
congress.
and,
on
the
authority
of
the
new
mexico
on
other
cases
specifically
held
that
the
fee
passed
by
the
grant
in
section
2.
there,
your
honor,
if
i
may
refer
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question,
is
a
specific
reference
to
section
2
of
the
great
mellon
act
which
is
identical
--
i
mean,
the
northern
pacific
act
which
is,
we
say,
identical
with
the
union
pacific
act
and
which
says
that
the
fee
passed.
now,
of
course,
it's
a
matter
of
common
--
it's
common
in
the
law
for
a
grant
of
a
fee
to
be
limited
or
qualified
by
a
condition
that
the
lands
will
be
used
for
a
particular
purpose
and,
at
--
upon
the
cessation
of
that
use,
it
will
revert
to
the
grantor.
and,
that
is
exactly
what
the
court
held
in
the
townsend
case.
i'd
just
like
to
quote
this
one
sentence,
“the
substantial
consideration
inducing
the
grant
was
the
perpetual
use
of
the
land
for
the
legitimate
purposes
of
the
railroads,
just
as
all
the
land,”
and
notice,
again,
they
say
“the
land,”
“had
been
conveyed
in
terms
to
have
and
to
hold
the
same
so
long
as
it
was
used
for
railroad
right
of
way.”
mr.
william
w.
clary
yes,
your
honor,
both
the
northern
pacific
and
the
atlantic
pacific
grant
had
exceptions
of
mineral
lands
in
--
in
the
place
land
grant.
mr.
william
w.
clary
i
think
the
phrase
is
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
yes,
your
honor.
the
phrase
i
believe
is
identical
in
both
those
facts.
mr.
william
w.
clary
well,
we
think
it
was.
yes,
your
honor.
we
think
that
the
court
said
it
was.
it
said
that
the
nature
of
the
--
that
the
decision
depended
on
the
nature
of
the
estate
granted.
that
is
the
basis
upon
which
the
court
made
its
decision.
mr.
william
w.
clary
that
is
new
mexico
versus
united
states
trust
company,
172
u.s.
now,
just
--
we
come
to
one
more
point
on
the
--
on
the
legal
effect
of
this
grant
of
a
fee
for
a
named
purpose.
the
court
of
appeals,
after
holding
on
the
basis
of
these
cases
that
the
right
of
way
had
been
granted
as
a
limited
fee,
applied
a
well-settled
rule
that,
so
long
as
the
estate
continues,
the
owner
has
the
same
right
to
remove
minerals
as
an
owner
in
fee
simple.
we
have
cited
authority
on
that.
mr.
william
w.
clary
which
case
was
that?
mr.
william
w.
clary
that
was
this
present
case.
i'm
saying
that
the
court,
your
honor,
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
our
case
said
that
the
holder
of
a
limited
fee
has
the
same
right
to
extract
the
minerals
as
the
holder
of
a
title
in
fee
simple.
and
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
well,
we
have
cited
a
number
of
cases
in
our
brief
and
i
would
like
to
read
one
right
now.a
--
a
sample
case,
a
very
typical
case,
a
state
case
is
davis
versus
skipper
125
texas
364,
where
the
plaintiffs
who
held
a
possibility
of
reverter
in
lands
which
had
been
granted
for
church
purposes
and
they
were
not
permitted
to
enjoin
the
search
from
billing
for
all.
the
court
in
that
case
said
so
long,
and
this
we
think
applies
specifically
to
this
present
case,
“so
long
as
there
is
no
abandonment
of
the
land
for
church
purposes,
the
trustees
of
the
church
may
use
the
land
to
the
extent
of
producing
oil
and
gas
there
from.
and,
conversely,
the
holder
of
a
mere
possibility
of
reverter
has
no
as
such
estate
as
authorizes
him
to
maintain
an
injunction
to
prevent
such
use
of
the
land.”
that
is
a
very
old
rule
and
we
have
cited
authorities
in
our
brief
supporting
it
all
the
way,
from
blackstone
and
kent
down
to
the
restatement
of
property
in
which
there
is
no
kind
of
question
to
what
that
is
as
a
rule
of
real
property
law.
now,
we
say
this
applies
--
this
is
not
a
local
rule.
it
is
not
a
rule
of
any
particular
state.
it
is
a
general
rule
of
property
law,
and
it
applies
here
because
of
the
holding
of
the
townsend
case,
was
that
the
purpose
of
congress
was
to
withhold
only
the
right
of
reversion
in
order
to
ensure,
as
far
as
possible,
the
perpetual
use
of
the
land
for
the
operation
of
the
railroad.
and,
since
that
is
the
only
right
reserved,
the
right
to
the
minerals
under
the
objective
rule
vested
in
the
owner
of
the
limited
fee.
mr.
william
w.
clary
i
say
that's
a
general
authority
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
i
say
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
i
say
that
when
a
limited
fee
is
conveyed
to
anybody,
a
railroad
or
anyone
else,
and
the
grantor
reserves
only
a
right
of
reverter
in
the
event
of
abandonment
that
the
right
to
take
the
minerals
belongs
to
the
owner
of
the
limited
fee
and
not
to
the
holder
of
the
reverter
or
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
is
what?
mr.
william
w.
clary
there
is
no
right
of
reverter
in
this
section,
your
honor,
but
the
court
in
the
townsend
and
other
cases
have
held
that
under
the
grant
of
section
2,
there
is
an
implied
condition
of
reverter
if
the
railroad
ceases
to
use
the
land
for
a
railroad.
mr.
william
w.
clary
well,
certainly.
well,
it
is
not
less
than
the
fee.
it's
one
kind
of
a
fee.
it's
a
limited
fee.
it's
a
fee
simple
so
long
as
it
lasts.
it's
--
it's
less
than
a
fee,
your
honor,
only
in
the
sense
that
it
may
end
at
some
future
time.
the
limitation
is
on
the
duration
of
the
estate
not
on
the
quality
or
extent
of
it.
but,
so
long
as
the
fee
is
not
forfeited
by
cessation
of
a
use,
the
owner
of
the
fee
has
all
the
rights
of
an
owner
in
fee
simple.
that
is
the
principle
which
i
say
has
thoroughly
established
both
the
state
and
federal
law.
mr.
william
w.
clary
well,
there
--
that
is
a
fee
--
what
your
honor
has
described
would
be
commonly
called
a
fee
simple
absolute,
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
--
but
there
are
--
there
are
qualified
determinable
or
diffusible
fees.
mr.
william
w.
clary
well,
they're
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
they're
less
than
fee
simple
absolute,
but
my
point
is
that
the
difference
is
in
the
duration
of
the
estate,
not
in
the
quantity
of
it.
and,
this
is
a
fee
which,
so
long
as
it
lasts,
carries
with
it
all
the
incidents
of
a
fee
simple
absolute.
now,
it
may
terminate
if
the
union
pacific
should
go
out
of
business
and
abandon
its
railroad,
then
the
fee
would
revert.
but,
until
that
time
happens,
the
--
the
union
pacific
owns
the
fee
and
had
all
the
incidents
of
the
owner
of
a
fee
simple
absolute
subject
to
that
one
limitation.
that's
why
it's
called
a
limited
fee.
mr.
william
w.
clary
your
honor,
as
far
as
i
know,
there's
never
been
a
decision
on
that,
but
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
that
is
true,
but
that
has
to
do
with
the
remedy
which
the
holder
of
the
reversion
would
apply,
namely,
whether
the
reverter
would
be
automatic
or
whether
the
holder
of
the
possibility
of
reverter
would
have
to
do
something
affirmative.
there
has
never
been
a
decision
on
that
but,
as
far
as
i
know,
it
never
happened.
but,
we
think
it's
totally
immaterial
in
this
case
because,
in
either
of
those
cases,
the
rights
of
the
holder
of
the
unlimited
or
conditional
fee
is
the
same,
and
they
are
the
same
as
the
owner
--
as
the
holder
of
a
title
in
fee
simple.
now,
i
have
yet
to
come
to
my
answer
to
counsel's
argument
that
we
should
read
a
reservation
of
minerals
into
this
grant
because
of
mineral
policy.
we
think
it's
vital
in
this
case
to
distinguish
between
an
exception
of
mineral
lands
from
a
general
grant
and
a
reservation
of
mineral
rights
from
a
grant
of
a
particular
piece
of
land.in
the
case
of
an
exception,
nothing
would
ever
passes.
the
title
doesn't
pass
at
all
to
the
excepted
lands.
but,
when
you
have
a
grant
reserving
mineral
rights,
it
brings
into
play
a
completely
different
principle.
the
title
to
the
land
does
pass
but
there
is
a
separation
of
the
underlying
minerals
from
the
rest
of
the
estate.
such
a
case
was
before
the
court,
i
believe,
only
a
week
or
two
ago
or
later,
minerals
versus
united
states.
that
was
a
case
of
a
mineral
reservation.
i
don't
think
it
has
any
relation
to
this
except
to
illustrate
what
a
mineral
reservation
is,
as
compared
with
an
exception
of
mineral
land.
now,
the
cases
cited
and
relied
upon
by
the
solicitor
general
regarding
the
policy
are
all
cases
which
refer
to
an
exception
of
mineral
lands
and
there
is
no
suggestion
in
any
of
these
cases
that
there
was
any
policy
of
reserving
mineral
rights.
now,
petitioner
concedes
that
that
exception
of
mineral
lands
could
not
apply
to
the
right
of
way.
but
--
and,
it
should
be
added
that
the
grant
of
the
right
of
way
itself
contained
a
no
reservation
of
mineral
rights.
therefore,
petitioner
is
forced
to
argue
not
that
mineral
land
should
be
excepted
from
the
right
of
way,
but
that
the
court
should
read
into
section
2
a
reservation
of
mineral
rights
on
the
basis
of
federal
policy.
and,
we
think
the
history
of
the
federal
policy,
which
we've
outlined
in
detail
in
our
brief,
does
not
support
that
argument.
the
policy
of
granting
a
fee
in
reserving
minerals
was
not
fully
developed
until
1916,
and
such
a
reservation
could
not
have
been
intended
by
congress
in
1862.
during
the
last
half
of
the
19th
century,
the
policy
of
congress
regarding
both
mineral
and
agricultural
land
was
to
encourage
their
development
just
as
rapidly
as
possible.
and,
congress
believes
that
the
most
effective
way
to
do
this
was
to
segregate
mineral
lands
on
the
one
hand,
and
agricultural
lands
on
the
other,
and
provide
for
a
disposition
of
each
class
of
land
under
a
different
set
of
laws.
but,
in
making
this
segregation,
there
was
no
intention
of
withholding
mineral
land
from
development.
on
the
contrary,
the
mineral
lands
could
be
filed
upon
and
patented
after
1866
as
readily
as
agriculture
lands.
mr.
william
w.
clary
and,
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
in
certain
portions
of
the
400-foot
step.
mr.
william
w.
clary
i
intended
to
cover
that
point,
your
honor,
if
i
get
to
it.
mr.
william
w.
clary
i
don't
think
the
townsend
case
prohibits
the
railroad
itself.
mr.
william
w.
clary
well,
it
prohibits
them
from
selling
but
it
doesn't
prohibit
it
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
i
think
it
would
prohibit
it
from
making
any
alienation
--
i
don't
--
of
its
land
for
any
long
period,
but
i
don't
think
it
prohibits
it
from,
itself,
making
other
uses
which
do
not
interfere
with
the
operation
of
the
railroad.
mr.
william
w.
clary
no,
they
may
not
be.
they
may
be
anything.
mr.
william
w.
clary
but
in
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
--
in
every
instance
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
in
every
instance,
your
honor,
the
railroad
would
reserve
the
right
to
repossess
that
land
the
moment
it
needed
it
for
railroad
purposes.
there's
a
full
discussion
of
that
in
the
brief.
i
don't
know
whether
--
i
should
like
to
discuss
this
question
of
mineral
policy
a
few
moments
and
then,
if
i
have
time,
i
will
take
up
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
i
don't
think,
your
honor,
it
could
sell
it
at
all.
it
had
no
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
the
court
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
the
court
held
in
the
townsend
case
that
it
could
not
alienate
that
right
of
way.
mr.
william
w.
clary
it's
not
inconsistent
with
a
limited
fee
for
the
use
granted
for
the
purposes
of
the
railroad.
mr.
william
w.
clary
that
would,
in
effect,
be
an
abandonment,
yes.
mr.
william
w.
clary
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
william
w.
clary
but
--
developing
the
grant
does
not
limit
the
railroad
from
the
use
of
the
land
so
long
as
it
operates
the
railroad
for
other
purposes
which
are
not
inconsistent.
mr.
william
w.
clary
the
only
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
one
time,
i
thought
they
could
do
that.
and,
the
townsend
case
held
that
because
the
grant
was
made
for
the
purpose
of
the
operation
of
a
railroad,
they
could
not
alienate
it,
but
there
are
many
cases
which
are
cited
in
our
brief
that
hold
--
that
hold
that
the
company
itself
may
temporarily
use
--
use
portions,
portions
of
the
railroad
not
presently
needed
for
railroad
purposes,
for
any
other
legitimate
purpose
which
does
not
interfere
with
the
operation
of
the
railroad.
and,
that
is
a
universal
practice
of
railroads.
it
was
never
been
held
to
constitute
a
forfeiture
and
it
since
--
it's
neither
a
forfeiture
nor
a
ground
for
injunction.
and,
here,
the
union
pacific
is
using
a
very
small
piece
of
--
it's
proposing
to
use
a
very
small
piece
of
right
of
way,
not
presently
needed
for
the
railroad,
to
drill
an
oil
well
on.
there's
no
interference.
the
court
has
found
that
it
does
not
interfere,
so
that
there
--
there
is
nothing
inconsistent
with
that
for
the
use
of
the
railroad,
but
it
must
maintain
title
under
the
townsend
case
or
it
could
abandon
its
title
completely,
then
it
would
revert.
mr.
william
w.
clary
it
could
lease
providing
it
always
preserved
the
right
to
repossess
the
land
if
needed
for
railroad
purposes,
and
that
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
in
every
lease
the
railroad
has
ever
made
is
the
right
to
repossess
when
it's
needed.
mr.
william
w.
clary
after
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
that
issue
was
raised
in
the
trial
court
here,
but
the
court
found
that
the
proposed
operations
would
not
interfere
with
the
operations
of
the
railroad
and,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
that
finding
was
not
challenged.
on
this
matter
of
--
of
mineral
policy,
the
purpose
of
accepting
mineral
lands
from
the
operation
of
--
from
the
alternate
sections
was
not
to
prevent
the
development
of
the
mineral
lands,
but
to
keep
them
from
being
taken
up
and
patented
as
agricultural
lands,
so
that
they
might
be
patented
as
mineral
lands.
the
policy
of
the
government
was
to
patent
both
types
of
land
under
separate
laws
at
nominal
prices
without
any
royalty.
there
was
no
attempt
to
hold
them
back.
so
that,
a
reservation
of
minerals
in
the
right
of
way
--
to
read
in
such
a
reservation
of
minerals
in
the
right
of
way
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
federal
policy
of
that
kind.
now,
the
policy
of
reserving
minerals
and
granted
land,
separating
the
mineral
rights
from
the
estate,
did
not
develop
until
after
the
withdrawals
by
president
roosevelt
and
taft
in
the
1900s
for
reasons
which
i
will
not
have
time
to
go
into
but,
because
the
segregation
policy
had
not,
at
that
time,
was
not
working
successfully,
the
--
there
had
been
abuses
because
coal
lands
had
been
taken
up
as
agricultural
--
as
agricultural
lands
and,
so,
those
lands
were
withdrawn
until
a
--
a
segregation
could
be
made.
as
a
result
of
that
withdrawal,
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
garfield,
in
1907,
recommended
what
he
called
a
brand
new
policy
of
separating
the
minerals
and
granting
the
surface.
that
was
a
new
concept
in
the
history
of
mineral
policy
in
the
united
states,
and
that
policy
was
first
put
into
effect
with
regard
to
coal
lands
in
1862,
i
beg
your
pardon,
in
1909
and
became
general
in
1916.
as
to
the
stock-raising
homestead
act,
all
minerals
were
excepted
from
patents
under
those
acts.
and,
the
leasing
act
of
1920
completed
the
--
the
development
of
this
new
policy
of
reserving
mineral
rights
in
granted
lands.
and,
so,
we
think
it
follows
that,
in
1862,
congress
not
only
did
not,
but
would
not,
under
any
circumstances,
have
reserved
minerals
from
the
grant
of
this
right
of
way.
now,
one
final
point,
the
solicitor
general
has
argued
that
the
rule
of
strict
construction
prevents
the
minerals
from
passing.
we
had
cited
the
cases
in
our
brief,
which
i
won't
have
time
to
discuss,
but
i
will
say
that
it
is
definitely
settled
that,
as
of
that
period
of
time,
in
--
that
when
the
title
passed,
once
the
patent
was
issued,
as
we
said
with
regard
to
the
place
lands,
the
minerals
passed
with
it.
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
title
passed
by
virtue
of
a
patent
or
by
a
statute.
we
maintain
that
title
passed
by
the
statute
of
1862
and
these
decisions
hold
that
when
that
title
passed,
minerals
passed
without
any
special
mention.
it
has
never
been
held
that
there's
any
rule
so
strict
that
a
grant
by
the
united
states
in
words
which
commonly
convey
a
fee
do
not
pass
all
the
incidence
of
a
fee
but
that
there
must,
in
addition
to
that,
be
spelled
out
what
go
with
a
grant
of
a
fee.
the
united
states,
when
it
grants
land
and
fee,
grants
land
and
fee
as
anyone
else
does.
if
it
uses
its
words
that
have
that
legal
meaning
which,
as
i
pointed
out,
were
used
here,
as
stated
in
the
excerpt
i
read
from
mr.
justice
hughes'
opinion.
mr.
william
w.
clary
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
w.
clary
in
the
act.
mr.
william
w.
clary
that's
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
--
true.
mr.
william
w.
clary
well
--
mr.
william
w.
clary
that
is
the
correct
statement
of
what
happened,
but
it
seems
to
us
that
it's
immaterial
because
counsel
himself
concedes
that
the
exception,
even
though
it
says
in
this
act,
cannot
apply
to
the
right
of
way.
we
think
that
the
reason
the
word
“act”
was
put
in
there
was
because,
in
sections
9,
13,
and
14
there
are
grants
to
five
other
railroads
in
--
which
carry
place
lands
in
order
to
make
sure
and
--
and
not
to
have
to
repeat
the
mineral
exception
in
each
one
of
those
five
grants.
it
would
be
perfectly
natural
for
congress
to
say,
“well,
we'll
make
this
exception
here
apply
to
the
entire
act.”
but,
even
though
it
says
that,
the
physical
conditions
are
such
that
it
couldn't
apply
to
the
right
of
way,
as
stated
and
conceded
by
counsel.
and,
in
order
to
get
around
that,
counsel
wants
the
court
to
read
into
the
act
a
reservation
which
we
claim
is
a
totally
different
kind
of
an
animal,
if
you'll
pardon
the
