justice
harold
burton
does
that
mean
then,
in
the
case
of
mineral
lands,
there
shall
not
be
any
place
lands
taken
from
the
mineral
lands?
justice
harold
burton
isn't
there
a
distinction
between
mineral
lands
and
mineral
rights?
justice
harold
burton
it
would
be
necessary,
wouldn't
it,
for
the
right
of
way
to
go
straight
ahead,
whether
there
are
any
mineral
lands
there
or
not.
justice
harold
burton
it
said
nothing
in
act
about
mineral
rights
in
that
question.
justice
harold
burton
but,
even
in
1862,
the
phrase
“mineral
land”
as
it
appears
in
the
statute
wasn't
just
a
way
of
saying
land
that
might
have
minerals
under
them,
was
it?it
was
--
it
was
a
legal
phrase
that
had
a
meaning
of
its
own.
so
--
so,
you
could
identify
what
they
meant
when
they
said
mineral
land.
justice
harold
burton
when
they
said
except
mineral
lands,
they
meant
except
those
kinds
of
lands
that
the
government
had
designated
in
--
in
some
manner
as
mineral
lands,
not
all
lands
that
might
possibly
have
minerals
under
them.
justice
harold
burton
you
mentioned
something
about
administrative
interpretations.
there
weren't
any
for
a
long,
long
time,
were
there?
justice
harold
burton
but
there
is
no
interpretation
that
carries
out
your
point
of
view
from
the
administrative
end
of
it
for
many
years.
justice
harold
burton
because
they've
learned
a
lot
in
those
50
years.
justice
harold
burton
when
you
complete
your
survey,
you
must
file
a
certified
map
of
some
kind.
justice
harold
burton
and
that's
what
marked
your
lines.
