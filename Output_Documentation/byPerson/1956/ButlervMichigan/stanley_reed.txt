before
--
before
you
get
in
to
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
saying
what
you're
clearing
out,
is
that
also
include
whether
or
not
the
book
as
a
whole
is
obscene?
justice
stanley
reed
you
--
you
have
an
insertion
in
your
brief,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
court
did
not
find
the
book
as
a
whole
obscene.
justice
stanley
reed
and
would
you
argue
that
question?
justice
stanley
reed
well
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
your
view
--
does
that
mean
that
your
contention
in
regard
to
"containing"
is
not
--
justice
stanley
reed
i
know
but
you
said
just
now
that
you
would
concede
if
you
put
a
period
after
"descriptions".
justice
stanley
reed
you
--
you
think
it
had
to
be
the
entire
book.
justice
stanley
reed
well,
how
can
--
i
have
difficulty
in
following
you
on
that.
so
i'm
holding
that
the
defendant
is
guilty
because
he
sold
the
book
in
the
city
of
detroit,
pertaining
this
language,
and
also
because
the
court
feels
that
even
during
the
book,
as
a
whole,
is
not
necessary
to
the
proper
development
of
the
theme
of
the
book
your
in
conflict
with.
justice
stanley
reed
it
may
be
different
words
but
so
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
hold
the
man
is
guilty
because
he
sold
the
book
containing
this
language,
all
the
language
of
the
book,
i
suppose.
justice
stanley
reed
what
is
all
--
all
the
language
has
been
referred
to
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
whatever
it
referred
to,
all
through
the
opinion.
justice
stanley
reed
all
the
passages
are
read,
i
don't
suppose
you
read
the
whole
book.
justice
stanley
reed
no,
i
mean
--
justice
stanley
reed
to
the
--
to
the
court
of
the
trial.
justice
stanley
reed
the
court
--
justice
stanley
reed
obviously,
there
are
words
in
there
that
are
not
--
justice
stanley
reed
well,
they're
not
common
parlance.
there
are
also
words
that
are
not
salacious
or
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
obscene.
but
he
says,
pertaining
this
language,
the
book
contains
this
language
and
i
--
during
the
book
as
a
whole,
i
find
the
defendant
guilty.
justice
stanley
reed
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
stanley
reed
we're
taking
right
here
about
the
problem
of
whether
or
not
he
determines
that
the
book
as
a
whole
was
obscene.
justice
stanley
reed
yes.
justice
stanley
reed
what
will
say
to
the
other
--
justice
stanley
reed
(inaudible)
i
suppose?
justice
stanley
reed
you
also
say
that
the
other
construction
would
be
possible
that
he
did
say
as
a
whole.
justice
stanley
reed
no,
you
don't
say
so,
but
i
--
i
suppose
it's
a
possible
construction.
you
say
that
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
stanley
reed
would
you
--
would
you
think
that
--
if
something
that
was
obscene
conceivably
not
have
a
small
influence
on
you?
justice
stanley
reed
i
agree,
it
would
be
very
difficult
if
you
didn't
have
the
lewd
and
obscene
in
the
last
sentence
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
first.
justice
stanley
reed
that's
right.
justice
stanley
reed
that
adds
nothing
to
the
requirement
of
this.
