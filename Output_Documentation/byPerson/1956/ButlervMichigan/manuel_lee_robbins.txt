mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
yes,
sir.
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
early
summer
of
1954,
mr.
butler,
the
appellant
in
this
case,
sold
a
book
to
an
adult
police
officer
in
detroit,
michigan.
for
this,
he
was
promptly
arrested,
prosecuted
and
convicted
under
a
statute
which,
from
the
very
outset
of
the
litigation
to
this
very
day
in
court,
we
have
contended
is
an
invasion
of
the
freedom
of
press
and
of
due
process
of
law.
after
our
conviction
in
the
trial
court,
we
sought
leave
to
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
and
the
prosecutor,
in
consenting
to
the
appeal,
certified
to
the
court
that
in
his
opinion,
the
statute
needed
clarification.
but
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
denied
our
application
for
leave
to
appeal
and
we
had
no
clarification.
now,
before
i
start
on
the
main
argument
of
the
case,
i
should
like
to
just
clear
the
atmosphere
for
a
second
to
indicate
what
is
not
in
this
case.
we
fully
recognize
that
this
is
not
a
case
of
prior
restraints.
we
were
convicted
for
selling
a
book.
second
of
all,
we
also
recognized
that
a
properly
drawn
statute
forbidding
and
punishing
the
distribution
of
obscene
literature,
just
as
simply
as
that,
would
be
certainly
valid
under
the
exercise
of
a
state
of
police
power.
in
other
words,
if
the
statute
said
it
is
a
crime
to
distribute
obscene
literature,
we
say
that
that
would
be
valid
under
the
state
police
power.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
pardon
me,
sir.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
well,
it
--
frankly,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
verbatim
repetition
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
--
of
my
words
but
the
mere
proscription
against
the
sale
or
distribution
of
obscene
literature
and
not
with
a
lot
of
other
qualifying
phrases
after
it.
it
is
not
my
opinion
make
it
unconstitutional.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
i
would,
sir.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
now,
the
statute
that
we
have
here
is
a
far
cry
from
that.
but
before
i
get
to
the
statute,
i
should
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
book
itself.
i
have
in
my
hand
here
a
facsimile
copy
of
people
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
yes,
sir.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
i'm
coming
to
that,
your
honor.
that
is
a
--
a
point.
i
am
taking
the
position
that
as
far
as
judicial
--
as
far
as
our
statute,
i'd
come
to
that
later
but
i'm
going
to
develop
the
point
to
the
statute
which
--
containing
statute
is
not
constitutional.
the
book
must
be
judged
as
a
whole.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
i
--
that
is
true,
sir.
i
do
say
that
in
my
brief.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
i
will
argue
that
question.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
if
it's
just
as
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
i
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
i
say
--
i
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
we
are
on
a
different
question.
i
have
a
different
statute
and
i'm
not
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
--
claiming
that
this
is
just
an
obscenity
statute.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
all
right.
now,
so
far
as
the
book
is
concerned,
i
have
in
my
hand
a
facsimile
copy
of
people's
exhibit
1
which
in
the
record
of
this
case.
this
is
a
paperback
book.
it
sells
for
50
cents.
i'm
happy
to
note
that
the
covers
of
this
book
do
not
exhibit
any
sexually
stimulating
material.
the
front
cover
is
a
serious
parade
of
the
sad
and
curious
figures
of
the
leading
characters
in
the
book.
the
back
cover
has
got
a
comment
about
the
book,
by
the
side,
the
review
of
literature.
the
front
page
has
got
some
more
reviews
of
the
book,
wholesome
in
their
praise.
and
on
the
whole,
it
would
be
very
harder
to
view
this
book
as
an
attractive
nuisance
for
alluring
children
into
or
anyone
else
for
that
matter
into
any
salacious
reading.
now,
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
much
was
made
and
much
is
presently
made
in
my
adversary's
brief
of
the
method
of
distribution
of
this
book
and
it
take
a
sort
of
a
separate
rule
for
paperbound
books
as
against
hardcover
books.
now,
the
only
sale
in
the
record
of
this
case
was
a
sale
to
an
adult
police
officer.
there
isn't
a
scintilla
of
evidence
anywhere
in
this
case
that
it
was
sold
to
any
child
or
read
by
any
child.
now,
there
was
evidence
that
it
was
distributed
nationally
throughout
the
country
without
any
stimulating
promotion
campaign
that
it
appears
on
open
racks
and
stores
that
these
stores
are
drugstores,
or
5
and
10
cents
stores,
or
department
stores,
or
cigar
stores,
or
news
stands.
and
it
also
appear
that
in
some
of
these
stores,
school
supplies
may
be
sold.
now,
from
that
little
--
little
bit
of
kernel
comes
the
whole
thesis
that
this
book
must
necessarily,
therefore,
have
been
channeled
or
could
be
channeled
towards
an
intended
for
adolescent
reading
only.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
no,
sir.
this
is
a
word
per
word
--
virtually
word
per
word.
there
were
few
punctuation
changes
of
some
sort
but
other
than
that,
it
is
practically
the
same
book,
and
i'm
coming
to
the
original
edition
of
this
book.
but
there
isn't
anything
in
the
record
that
even
approximates
the
quantitative
analysis
of
proof
that
this
book
was
channeled
towards
or
intended
for
distributions
to
minors.
gosh
knows
that
adults
can
go
to
5
and
10
cents
stores
and
drug
stores
for
many
more
reasons
than
children.
now,
it
so
happens
at
the
time
of
the
trial
of
this
case,
the
hardcover
edition
of
this
book
was
in
the
public
library
of
detroit.
at
the
trial,
the
chief
of
the
book
selection
committee
of
that
library
testified
that
in
their
opinion,
they
thought
this
was
good
literature
that
the
public
library
ought
to
have
it
but
because
there
were
certain
passages
in
it
which
were
sexually
stimulating,
they
put
it
on
what
they
called
the
restricted
shelf.
that
meant
that
that
while
it
was
listed
for
the
home
reading
--
on
home
reading,
that
meant
that
adults
could
come
to
the
library
and
ask
for
it
and
get
it.
there
was
no
problem
about
that
but
it
was
not
on
the
open
shelves
where
children
might
get
it.
now,
just
take
the
position,
of
course,
that
if
the
library
had
a
copy
of
the
hardcover,
which
you
would
pay
$3
or
$4
for
and
it
was
--
you
wanted
to
replace
it
or
get
a
new
one,
if
they
wanted
us
to
get
this
--
the
same
book
for
50
cents
and
save
the
library's
money
and
wanted
this
edition
of
the
book,
nobody
would
dare
to
sell
it
to
him.
now,
the
book
itself,
we've
talked
about
the
distribution
and
the
format
of
this
book.
the
book
itself
is
a
--
has
been
paraphrased
in
my
brief,
it
has
been
elaborately
commented
upon
on
the
record
but
frankly,
it's
a
story
of
a
conflict
within
a
man.
it's
the
story
of
a
man
who
has
tasted
worldly
life
and
earthly
pleasures
and
as
a
student
of
musicology
comes
to
this
benedictine
monastery
in
the
countryside
of
france
to
study
the
gregorian
chant.
he
lives
in
the
monastery
and
then
from
there,
for
the
first
time
in
his
life,
he
feels
a
different
spirit
evolving
about
him,
he
feels
a
call
to
an
inner
peace
and
--
and
happiness.
he
starts
to
realize
that
his
life
head
him
to
fleshly
as
it
may
have
been
is
not
what
he
is
ultimately
content
with
and
he
has
this
conflict
developing
in
himself
with
how
much
of
the
world
will
he
give
up
and
how
much
peace
and
security
are
represented
by
the
monastery.
ultimately,
he
is
one
through
the
sanctity
but
not
without
some
tempestuous
problems
on
route.
now,
of
course,
he
reminisces
this
from
time
to
time
as
to
his
prior
pleasures
and
dalliances
and,
of
course,
from
time
to
time
he
lapses
away
from
the
monastic
life.
now,
some
of
this
language
and
some
of
the
description,
i
admit,
is
in
--
of
--
of
earthy
nature.
it
is
realistic
writing.
it
is
of
the
naturalistic
vein.
there
is
some
discussion
and
treatment
of
sex
situations.
there
was
also
the
blunt
and
earthy
idiom
of
the
french
countryside.
but
view
it
as
a
whole,
as
i
will
argue
later
and
say
now,
as
it
must
be,
these
were
in
parts
that
were
indigenous
to
the
story
and
at
least
fairly,
reasonably
connected
with
its
plot.
now,
at
the
trial
when
our
constitutional
objections
were
overruled,
we
went
ahead
and
defended
this
book
on
the
merits.
we
--
the
two
eminent
professors,
one
from
the
university
of
pennsylvania
and
one
from
the
university
of
michigan,
the
very
area
where
the
prosecution
was
brought,
testified
that
in
their
opinion,
this
was
a
serious
work.
it
was
excellent
writing.
it
was
high
--
highly
ethical
--
ethically
motivated
novel.
and
that
viewed
as
a
whole
and
by
its
dominating
--
dominating
themes,
it
was
a
good
piece
of
literature.
it
would
be
hard
to
fathom
under
that
testimony
how
our
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
could
be
established,
but
we
have
to
look
to
the
statute
itself
to
find
out
exactly
how
we
were
convicted.
the
statute
says
that
if
the
book
contains
language
in
description
which
is
obscene,
and
i'm
coming
to
the
other
point
just
take
it
from
obscene,
it
is
a
crime
to
distribute
that
book.
now,
i
don't
have
to
labor
the
point
to
--
to
show
that
we
certainly
contained
in
isolated
aspects,
certain
--
certain
language
which
of
--
is
not
related
to
the
whole
might
be
offensive.
but
if
--
the
--
the
statute
in
this
case
permits
a
conviction
for
the
containing,
not
--
and
does
not,
in
the
realistic
sense,
consider
that
the
book
must
be
treated
as
a
whole
and
by
its
dominant
theme.
now
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
the
statute
appears
on
page
5
of
my
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
my
attack
is
on
the
statute
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
--
on
its
face
and
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
all
right.
now,
the
--
the
statute
is
rather
lengthy
one,
as
i
reprinted
it
in
page
5
of
my
brief.
i
would
--
i
think
a
fair
and
accurate
paraphrase
of
the
statute
is
that
it's
a
crime
to
sell
a
book
or
distribute
a
book
which
contains
obscene,
and
i'm
--
there
was
immoral,
lewd
or
lascivious
language.
i
--
my
position
is
that
that
would
be
virtually
the
same
as
obscene,
contain
obscene
language
or
descriptions
tending
to
insight
minors
to
violent
or
depraved
or
immoral
acts
manifestly
tending
to
the
corruption
of
the
morals
of
humans.
that's
the
part
of
the
statute
that
we
were
involved
with
in
this
case,
but
as
--
we
have
no
proof.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
i
have
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
that's
right.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
yes,
sir.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
i'm
sorry.
that's
right.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
yes.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
no,
containing,
sir,
containing
obscene,
immoral,
lewd
or
lascivious
language
or
obscene,
immoral,
lewd
or
lascivious
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
--
language
or
obscene,
immoral,
lewd
or
lascivious
prints,
pictures,
figures
or
descriptions
then
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
--
the
qualifying
phrase
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
--
tending
to
incite
minors.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
if
it
--
that's
right.
it's
--
that
is
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
--
the
position
i
took
from
the
start.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
pardon
me,
sir?
i
didn't
gather
your
point.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
that
is
my
view.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
i
can't
decide
what's
constitutional,
your
honor,
i
understand.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
i
understand.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
i
understand.
well,
when
i
say
"conceding",
i
don't
mean
any
assumption
of
the
authority
of
the
court.
i
would
say
--
perhaps,
may
i
modify
to
say
that
i
would
not
be
here
contending
that
a
statute
which
merely
says,
this
is
a
crime
to
distribute
obscene
literature
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
no,
sir.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
i
--
i
have
had
happen
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
that
is
only
one
of
my
contentions,
sir.
i
haven't
gotten
--
haven't
had
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon,
mr.
justice
reed.
you're
quite
right.
i
was
in
error.
i
will
withdraw
my
answer
to
judge
frankfurter.
the
containing
aspect,
i
still
would
find
unconstitutional.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
that
is
right.
i
didn't
realize
the
significance
of
that.
and
if
they
took
the
"containing"
out
and
then
put
the
period
then,
then
i
would
be
content
with
the
statute.
thank
you
for
pointing
that
out.
now,
i
have
--
we
have
eluded
--
i
mean,
the
--
there
was
a
wealth
of
authority
to
the
fact
that
book
must
be
viewed
as
a
whole
by
its
dominant
themes
and
you
can't
take
isolated
passages
out
of
their
context.
actually,
at
the
trial,
before
the
trial
started,
a
long
list
of
excerpts
of
the
so-called
salacious
parts
was
prepared
by
the
prosecutor,
shown
to
his
defense
witnesses.
they
were
examined
on
that.
and
a
great
deal
of
attention
by
prosecutor
and
by
court
was
spent
on
having
them
read
the
excerpts
and
--
and
give
their
opinions
about
it.
the
focus
of
the
whole
rebuttal
by
the
people
was
on
the
excerpts.
ultimately,
of
course,
and
i
believe
that
was
our
undoing
in
the
--
in
the
finding.
and
the
judge
in
his
opinion,
the
trial
judge
in
his
opinion
that
police
stated
that
he
find
the
book
contains
language
and
description.
now,
i
want
to
point
the
court
in
all
candor,
i
want
to
point
to
the
--
the
court's
attention
to
a
further
comment
that
the
court
made
and
--
the
trial
court
made
in
its
opinion.
he
says,
"i
find
that
the
--
that
this
book
contains
language
and
descriptions
which
is
obscene,"
and
so
forth
and
goes
on
with
the
qualifying
phrases,
and
he
says
and
what's
more,
'when
viewed
as
a
whole,
i
don't
think
these
passages
were
necessary
to
the
development
of
the
--
of
the
plot
of
the
book
where
the
conflict
expressed."
now,
that,
i
don't
want
any
--
i
shouldn't
want
anyone
to
think
that
that
isn't
anyway
a
view
of
the
book
as
a
whole.
he
is
saying
he
finds
and
he
says
he
is
taking
the
statute
as
it
is.
he
says
he
finds
that
it
contained
these
things
and
then
he
gives
as
a
matter
of
dicta,
in
all
due
fairness,
an
opinion
that
literarily,
these
other
passages
were
necessary.
he
doesn't
say
bluntly
and
afterwards
were
at
hand,
he
doesn't
say
bluntly
that
this
makes
the
book
obscene
as
a
whole.
he
just
says
it
wasn't
necessary
to
put
these
passages
in
the
book
but
he
doesn't
find
the
book,
by
its
dominant
themes
and
by
view
to
the
whole,
was
obscene.
he
says
that
in
his
opinion,
it
wasn't
necessary
to
--
to
develop
the
conflict.
now
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
yes.
that
is
the
language
i
am
referring
to
your
honor.
i'm
saying
that
that
is
a
different
than
same
that
i
find
that
this
makes
the
book
as
a
whole
obscene.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
well,
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
no.
well,
you
have
to
look
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
but
the
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
but
he
is
--
he
is
repeating
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
i
read
the
whole
book.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
the
court?
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
no,
the
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
--
well,
the
--
the
book
was
submitted
in
evidence
and
the
court
just
read
them.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
common
parlance.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
oh.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
if
your
honor
please.
but
he
--
that
is
--
he
is
really
--
really
repeating.
i
mean,
the
emphasis
on
this
opinion,
i
think,
is
on
the
"containing".
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
because
above
that,
he
says
however
the
court
does
have
to
find
that
it
is
in
violation
of
this
particular
statute
because
the
statute
does
say
that
it
is
sufficient
to
contain
lewd,
immoral,
obscene,
lascivious
language
or
description.
now,
his
primary
finding,
if
your
honor
please,
i
mean
--
and
i
--
i
have
no
better
way
of
delving
into
a
judge's
mind
than
anyone
else.
but
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
conduct
of
the
trial
and
look
at
the
examination
of
the
witnesses
and
then
look
at
this
opinion
as
a
whole,
you're
saying
he
is
arguing
all
the
time
that
it
contains
these
things.
and
then
he,
for
some
reason,
and
i
don't
think
this
is
--
this
was
justified
under
statute,
is
saying,
and
his
questions
to
the
witnesses
at
the
trial
with
the
same
way,
he
is
saying
"didn't
have
to
put
this
language
in
to
get
your
point
across,
mr.
author".
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
now,
that's
what
he
is
saying
here.
he
is
saying
it
was
unnecessary.
that,
if
your
honor
pleases,
is
more,
not
a
--
a
legal
judgment
of
what
is
obscene
language
and
description,
that
is
more
illegal
judgement
of
how
--
of
whether
it
was
literally
or
artistically
necessary.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
yes.
and
i
say
he
didn't
determine
that
the
book
as
a
whole
was
obscene.
i
say
he
determined
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
that's
right.
that's
--
that's
right,
sir.
i
think
he
took
the
bull
by
the
horns.
and
i
think
he
was
adding
gratuitously.
he
didn't
--
he
was
telling
the
world,
he
saw
no
need
for
putting
this
to
stop
and
that
it
didn't
help
book
any.
but
he
--
i
think
he
meant
very
definitely
in
the
whole
opinion
and
the
whole
conduct
of
the
trial
examine,
he
meant
very
definitely
to
hold
squarely
that
this
containing
--
this
book
contained.
and
that's
what
we
were
in
court
on
and
that's
what
we
were
convicted
of.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
that's
right.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
i
think
that
is
true,
sir.
i
think
it
is
limited
to
a
containing
point.
i
think
if
he
wanted
to
say,
"now,
i'm
--
the
only
other
way
he
could
have
done
it
if
he
really
wanted
to
obviate
my
contention
was
to
say,
"now,
containing
doesn't
mean
just
isolated
passage,
i'm
saying
that
it
contains
it
to
the
extent
that
the
book
as
a
whole
is
just
replete
please
with
it."
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
now,
he
doesn't
say
that.
they
were
words
(inaudible)
and
he
doesn't
use
it.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
he
might
have.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
he
might
have
and
he
didn't.
he
interpreted
--
he
--
he
convicted
us
as
a
--
because
our
book
contained
and
i
think
it
--
that's
a
fair
--
fair
analysis
of
the
whole
trial
and
of
the
opinion.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
i
think
a
very
literal
interpretation
of
that
statute
would
--
would
justify
that.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
yes.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
that's
right.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
yes.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
that's
right.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
it
is
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
this
construction
of
the
statute
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
offends
freedom
of
press.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
offends
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
this
--
does
this
case
get
down
on
it?
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
this
--
the
principles
of
this
case
get
down
to
it.
i
mean
i
don't
think
--
think
that
he
just
took
up
a
few
--
just
one
or
two
little
words
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
no.
the
principles
of
this
case
go
down
to
that.
it
can't
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
that's
right.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
that
is
true.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
that
is
true.
i
would
--
i
would
say
that
that
is
possible,
a
very
possible
thing
that
we
would
have
to
fear
if
this
was
the
construction.
now,
this
isn't
our
--
we've
spent
some
time
on
it
but
it
isn't
our
major
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
i
--
i
didn't
get
your
point.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
i
don't
--
i
don't
exceed
that.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
well,
not
to
me
to
say
that
it
is
possible
when
i
enlarge
it
consistently
that
i
didn't
think
that's
what
he
meant
but
i
--
i
suppose
reasonable
men
could
differ
on
it.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
i'm
not
a
michigan
attorney,
your
honor,
and
i
--
i
really
can't
answer
that
authoritatively.
i
think
any
judge
in
any
court,
when
a
question
of
constitutionality
is
raised
would
be
obliged
to
follow
the
constitution
and
the
--
his
understanding
of
the
statute
and
the
constitution
had
come
to
the
best
position
under
the
law
that
he
could.
i
don't
think
there
is
a
statute
that
says
judges
must
decide
against
constitutional
issue
or
must
--
must
uphold
statute.
i
would
think
that
he
had
power
to
--
to
discard
the
statute
and
claim
that
it
was
unconstitutional
but
i
cannot
answer
that
authoritatively.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
well,
he
is
--
yes.
well
--
i
tried
this
case,
your
honor,
and
the
recorder's
court
is
an
inferior
court
to
try
mainly
misdemeanors.
it
doesn't
have
a
stenographer
unless
you
asked
for
one.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
its
--
its
jurisdiction
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
my
co-counsel
has
informed
me.
its
jurisdiction
is
--
applies
to
all
crimes
committed
in
the
city
of
detroit.
felonies
as
well?
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
is
the
great
criminal
court
of
detroit?
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
i
thought
--
i
thought
there
was
a
county
court.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
i
--
i
must
apologize
to
any
slight
i
gave
to
the
recorder's
court.
i
was
trying
a
charge
there
which
--
in
--
in
this
case
which,
i
think,
was
punishable
only
by
fine
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
--
or
small
imprisonment.
now,
our
first
and
foremost
constitutional
objection
in
this
case
is
not
the
aspect
of
containing
although,
we
pressed
that
with
great
sincerity.
i
come
again
to
the
statute
and
say
that,
what
this
statute
also
does
is
to
say
that
if
this
book
contains
any
languages
and
--
and
descriptions
which
is
--
which
of
--
is
obscene
for
children,
it
can't
be
sold
to
anyone.
in
other
words,
if
this
is
obscene
and
tends
to
incite
minors
and
thereby,
tends
to
incite
minors
to
violent
and
depraved
and
immoral
acts
manifestly
tending
to
the
corruption
of
the
morals
of
youth,
it
cannot
be
sold.
this
means
an
adult
couldn't
buy
it.
this
means
the
public
library
couldn't
buy
it
and
educational
institution
couldn't
buy
it.
and
it
means
quite
generally,
that
the
whole
world
of
adult
readership
is
fobbed
off
because
it
might
be
bad
for
children.
now,
again,
i
don't
want
to
labor
that.
i
think
it's
a
very
drastic
inroad
on
our
freedom
of
press.
in
other
words,
what
a
child
or
an
adolescent
or
a
minor
could
not
helpfully
digest
or
it
might
work
some
--
some
evil
on
him,
that
book
cannot
be
read
by
--
or
purchased
by
any
adult.
no
one
--
no
one
will
sell
that
to
an
adult.
now,
of
course,
we
all
--
as
i
said
in
the
beginning,
of
course,
the
public
--
the
police
power
of
a
state
is
quite
right
in
protecting
the
adolescence
and
minors
of
a
state
but
there
are
limits
to
the
degree
to
which
they
can
go.
they
can't
take
overly
drastic
and
highly
excessive
means
to
protect
this
situation.
what's
more,
they
--
they
rid
the
whole
--
they
reduced
the
whole
adult
readership
in
the
community
to
the
standard
of
a
child's
library.
actually,
the
statute,
itself,
i
term,
a
legislative
clarification
of
the
rule
in
the
hicklin
case.
the
old
1868
rule
in
england
was
that
a
book
was
to
be
considered
obscene
if
the
matter
had
a
tendency
to
debase
or
corrupt
the
minds
or
morals
of
anyone
in
to
whose
hands
it
might
fall.
therefore,
it
was
the
children
and
the
village
idiot
and
the
moron
that
might
be
considered.
now,
by
the
last
20
years,
most
of
the
courts
in
this
country
have
abandoned
the
implications
of
the
hicklin
rule,
not
--
not
every
single
court
but
most
of
them
have
abandoned
the
implications
of
the
hicklin
rule
and
taken
a
better
position
and
saying
that
it's
the
average
person's
sex
instincts
which
are
the
--
used
to
be
the
test.
in
other
words,
if
the
book
is
viewed
as
a
whole
and
by
its
dominant
themes,
it's
dirt
for
dirt
sake
to
the
average
person
or
just
stimulates
the
sexual
appetite
of
--
of
all
classes
of
a
community
that
it
can
--
can
be
considered
obscene.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
but
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
well,
i
considered
that,
your
honor.
i
certainly
would
have
a
different
case.
i
would
have
a
harder
case.
i
don't
know
if
i
might
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
--
still
might
be
here.
i
don't
know.
might
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
i
might
still
not
be
here
but
i
have
a
lot
harder
case.
actually,
there
is
no
stuff
like
liquor
and
tobacco.
there
is
no
constitutional
freedom
to
distribute
liquor
and
tobacco
but
there
is
as
to
literature
and
i
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
--
don't
know
about
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
that's
right,
your
honor.
it
would
be
a
different
case.
now,
that
is
our
second
great
complaint
about
the
statute
and
third
complaint
about
the
statute
is
one
as
to
vagueness
and
uncertainty.
we
say
that
if
you'll
look
at
this
statute
and
you
see
that
obscene
is
modified
by
these
clauses
that
its
obscene
language
contains
obscene
language
and
descriptions,
tending
to
incite
minors
to
acts
of
violence,
depravity
and
immorality.
now,
i
suppose
this
--
i
don't
want
to
attack
the
word
"violence".
i
guess
i
could
come
to
some
accepted
definition
of
violence
but
i
certainly
would
have
a
lot
of
trouble
finding
a
definition
of
what
is
depraved
or
what
is
immoral
which
reason
--
on
--
on
terms
which
reasonable
men
might
not
vary.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
yes,
sir.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
that's
right.
whatever
concreteness
we've
had
in
the
term
of
obscenity
has
been
reduced
and
virtually
eliminated
by
saying
obscene
in
that
they
do
these
things.
that's
exactly
the
force
and
effect
of
--
of
these
clauses.
now
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
oh,
yes.
it
can
--
can
conceivably
but
--
but
things
--
the
things
that
are
depraved
or
what
corrupt
the
moral's
view,
i
don't
actually
know
what
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
--
standard
is
covered
by
the
moral's
view.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
yes.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
that's
right.
that's
true.
but
i
don't
--
i
don't
believe
that
you
can
say
obscene
and
then
say
in
that,
it
does
these
things
and
claim
that
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
--
you
have
a
definite
concept
of
obscenity
at
that
case.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
well,
it
--
it
isn't
just
it
adds
nothing
to,
it's
very
definitely
adds
such
a
wide
field
that
i
don't
exactly
know
what
is
--
what
publication
might
be
interdicted.
now,
i
say
reasonable
men
can
differ
as
to
what
depravity
and
what
immorality
are
and
what
manifestly
tends
to
corrupt
and
there's
another
aspect
of
this
thing,
it's
tending.
it
even
adds
to
the
confusion
by
saying
what
tends
to
do
these
things
or
what
manifestly
tends.
it
even
broadens
and
widens
the
entire
--
entire
field
of
interdicted
literature.
now,
there
are
no
standard
set
up
in
the
statute
as
to
what
tends
to
incite
or
what
manifestly
corrupts
these
youths.
there
are
no
standards
in
the
statute.
the
judge
doesn't
give
any
statements.
he
doesn't
show
in
any
way
in
--
in
which
these
standards
might
be
operative.
there
are
no
previous
cases
in
michigan
giving
us
any
sign
post
and
all
in
all,
i
would
say
that
no
member
of
the
public
could
conceivably
understand.
he
wouldn't
have
enough
notice
to
know
what
publications
were
interdicted.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
i
said
yes,
it
proscribes
an
obscenity
which
is
defined
in
a
way
which
is
vague.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
a
court
could
construe
--
a
state
court
could
construe
a
statute
--
i
suppose
any
way
it
--
it
chose
to
but
we
went
to
trial
on
the
statute
as
it
is
now
with
all
this
verbiage
in
it,
our
witnesses
were
questioned.
our
witnesses
in
the
other
side,
witnesses
were
questioned
and
there
were
examples
of
this
in
my
brief
as
to
whether
something
didn't
tend
to
incite
minors
to
violent
and
deprave
conduct.
we
--
we
were
--
the
court,
in
its
opinion,
said
that
--
he
thought
this
--
this
was
obscene,
lewd
and
intended
to
--
intended
to
incite
minors
to
violent,
deprave
and
immoral
acts.
so
that,
all
through
this
case,
we've
gone
--
we've
gone
on
this
litigation
with
the
fact
that
it
was
established
to
the
trial
court
satisfactory
that
was
obscene
in
that
it
tended
to
deprave
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
this
particular
obscenity?
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
oh,
no,
no.
they
were
--
well,
the
witnesses
were
directed
to
certain
excerpts
of
the
book
which
viewed
by
themselves.
they
paid
a
good
little
attention.
actually,
there
was
no
expert
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
--
there
was
no
expert
testimony
as
to
what
motivated
views,
none
whatsoever.
there
was
no
expert
testimony
on
either
side
as
to
what
the
written
were
--
what
any
of
the
--
what
written
words,
if
any,
in
here
would
tend
to
incite
as
experts.
they
were
literally
experts
who,
at
times,
thought
that
this
material
tended
to
deprave
--
to
incite
minors
but
there
was
no
expert
testimony
on
motivation
of
any
sort.
now,
we
were
--
at
the
trial,
we
were
confronted
by
these
words.we
--
we
didn't
have
a
trial
court
that
said,
"let's
just
forget
about
all
these
other
words,
just
let's
say
we're
talking
about
obscenity."
and
that
all
this
really
doesn't
interfere
with
the
question
of
obscenity.
if
that
was
the
case,
the
state
court
would
have
construed,
it
would
have
been
a
construction
by
a
state
court
that
this
was
just
merely,
as
judge
frankfurter
said,
we
put
the
period
after
obscenity.
but
we
went
all
through
the
trial
and
we've
gone
all
the
way
up
here.
we've
got
an
opinion
by
a
trial
court
which
included
these
words
and
we've
had
questions
after
questions
to
witnesses
on
that.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
i
--
i
would
say
that
except
that
i
think,
your
honor,
you
say
the
otherwise
clear.
i'm
not
so
absolutely
positive
obscenity
is
completely
free
from
any
doubt
but
at
least,
it
is
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
sufficiently
clear
of
doubt.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
well,
i
have
a
great
wealth
of
authority,
a
varying
--
a
varying
save.
i
can
give
you
only
my
personal
opinion
and
that
it
means
dirt
for
dirt
sake.
that
would
be
my
best
definition.
there
was
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
i
don't
know
how
constitutionally
clear
it
is
but
it's
the
best
i've
ever
been
able
to
arrive
at.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
[laughs]
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
i
don't
really
know.
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
well,
i
--
i
am
acquainted
with
the
opinions
that
advert
to
long
usage.
i
am
--
i
am
acquainted
with
that
aspect
of
it.
i
think
that
is
an
important
aspect
of
it.
i
think
also
because
people
deal
with
earthy
things.
people
have
obscene
literature
and
dirty
books.
it
has
been
in
everybody's
mind
for
quite
some
time
and
over
the
years
of
experience
with
sex
and
with
literature
and
with
dirty
things.
one
gets
some
sort
of
common
accepted
feeling
as
to
what
is
vague,
what
is
generally
permissible
and
what
is
not
generally
permissible.
human
experience
is
probably
the
best
answer
to
that.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
no
more
than
i
could
trust
the
judgment.
i
--
i
couldn't
trust
the
trial
judge
to
charge
a
jury
on
that.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
yes.
i
think
i
could
trust
a
judge
on
obscene.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
i
don't
know,
i've
only
--
i
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
yes,
but
there
may
be
sign
posts
either
inquire
adjudication
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
--
or
in
the
statute
or
in
the
regulation.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
they
may
have
been
--
you
--
my
experience
is
not
that
broad,
your
honor.
i've
conceived
that
they
may
have
been.
i
--
in
my
own
experiences
is,
as
far
as
literature
is
concerned,
we
--
i
have
never
been
in
a
case
whereas
willing
--
let
anybody
charge
as
to
what
was
immoral.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
yes.
i
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
with
lewd,
obscene
in
specific.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
now,
this
court
--
those
words
had
been
construed
as
(inaudible)
ever
since
the
schweringen
case
way
back
in
161.
well,
i
--
my
argument
has
been
eclipsed
to
this
extent.
i
think
i've
said
about
everything
that
can
be
said
in
this
--
in
this
field
except
that
on
the
last
point,
i
am
--
want
to
just
to
call
your
--
the
court's
attention,
that
there
were
a
series
of
motion
picture
cases,
i
know
they
are
licensing
cases.
i
know
they
are
--
they
--
there
are
some
distinctions
because
they
--
to
some
extent,
they
involve
prior
restraint.
but
i
think
the
tenor
and
the
flavor
of
these
--
of
these
decisions
and
we
haven't
been
blessed
with
many
opinions
here
but
we've
had
a
lot
of
decisions.
the
flavor
of
these
decisions
is
such
that
would
strike
down
words
of
--
such
as
immoral
or
what
would
debase
and
corrupt
morals.
it
would
strike
down
that
as
being
overly
vague
and
--
and
too
indefinite.
i
say,
of
course,
there's
no
difference
with
the
motion
pictures
and
books
but
i
say
that
the
same
flavor
of
those
decisions,
despite
incidental
distinctions,
ought
to
prevail
in
this
case.
now,
all
in
all,
and
i'll
conclude
my
argument
with
this.
all
in
all,
if
you
want
to
really
be
realistic
about
freedom
of
press
and
due
process
of
law
about
certainty
and
criminal
statute
affecting
the
distribution
of
literature,
all
in
all,
you
are
asked
to
construe
here,
the
prosecution
of
a
book
which
we
never
were
afraid
to
--
to
publish
and
we
never
--
we
weren't
squeamish
about
it.
it
was
in
--
by
eminent
professors
have
called
to
the
great
work.
but
we're
--
we're
convicted
here
of
selling
this
book
and
a
statute
which
really
says
it's
a
crime
to
distribute
to
anyone,
to
anyone
a
book
containing
language
and
descriptions
obscenely
motivating
and
corrupting
minors
or
youth
and
they're
not
interchangeable,
under
standards
which
are
not
ascertainable.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
yes.
the
statute
is
familiar
or
old.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
i
--
i
don't
recall
saying
that
but
i
--
i
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
oh,
i
--
i
said
long
usage
in
the
--
in
construction
of
obscenity,
yes.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
long
usage
as
to
the
construction
of
obscenity.
yes,
i
am
familiar
with
that.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
yes,
sir.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
yes,
it
does.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
i
can
say
that
the
modern
period
of
enlightenment,
and
i'm
considering
obscenity,
is
a
young
period
but
nevertheless,
if
we're
going
to
have
freedom
of
press
in
the
modern
period,
i
really
don't
care
how
old
the
statute
is.
we've
got
a
modern
world
to
live
in
and
we've
got
modern
considerations
for
the
distribution
of
literature.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
i
don't
know.
all
i
can
say
is
the
fact
that
the
statute
is
even
older
than
the
hicklin
case,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
it
is
important.
i
don't
--
i
don't
minimize
it.
i
say
if
i
--
when
--
when
the
chips
are
finally
down,
the
question
is
how
big
an
infringement
of
freedom
of
press
that
we
got
today.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
well,
i'll
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
but
the
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
it
does
have
a
good
deal
of
weight
but
other
things
must
--
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
--
have
weighed
also.
what's
more?
we
didn't
have
paperback
books
when
this
--
when
this
statute
was
there.
we
didn't
have
ready
public
distributions
to
adults
throughout
the
community.
mr.
manuel
lee
robbins
no,
your
honor.
i
understand
that.
