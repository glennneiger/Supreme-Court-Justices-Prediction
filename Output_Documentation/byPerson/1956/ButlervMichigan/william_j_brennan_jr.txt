j.
brennan,

so,
mr.
robbins,
does
that
mean
that,
as
you
view
the
statute,
it
proscribes
an
obscenity,
not
ordinary
obscenity
but
some
special
kind
of
obscenity?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
might
not
the
statute
also
be
read
as
merely
proscribing
obscenity
as
ordinary
--
ordinarily
understood
but
having
certain
effects?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
there
any
--
is
there
any
evidence
to
the
question
directly,
whether
this
particular
obscenity
did
have
the
effect
of
tending
to
incite
so
forth?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
involved
in
this
book,
in
the
excerpts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
shepherd,
may
i
ask?
is
this
statute
in
the
state's
burden
in
establishing
guilt
of
the
misdemeanor
satisfied
by
proof
of
some
special
kind
of
obscenity
which
is
not
ordinary
obscenity
or
is
it
that
it
requires
a
proof
of
some
special
effects
of
ordinary
obscenity
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then,
are
you
suggesting
that
the
statute
deals
only
with
ordinary
obscenity
and
then
actual
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
fact
that
the
appended
language
"tending
to
incite"
etcetera
is
surplusage?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
understand
from
that
that
the
state's
position
that
there
was
a
finding
on
the
book
as
a
whole.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
would
he
let
them
testify
whether
the
excerpts
would
or
would
not
corrupt?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
the
reason
i
asked
that
is
i
noticed
on
page
32,
he
made
a
statement
that
i
think
they
will
be
beneficial,
while
he
said,
and
on
the
other
hand
i
would
like
to
hear
the
opinions.
i
think
they
will
be
beneficial
and
helpful
to
the
court.
the
opinions
both
as
to
the
literary
value
and
as
to
whether
or
not
it
tends
to
corrupt
morals.
in
fact
there
was
no
such
evidence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
did
they
qualify
first
to
be
an
expert
in
this
field?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
why
--
why
do
you
have
to
reach
that
at
all?
did
this
--
did
this
judge
decide
on
the
book
as
a
whole?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
--
if
he
did
decide
on
it
as
a
whole,
you
don't
have
to
take
up
the
problem
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
marginal
cases.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
maybe
that
one
obscene
word
in
the
book
but
not
ban
the
whole
book
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
under
the
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
don't
have
--
we
don't
reach
that?
