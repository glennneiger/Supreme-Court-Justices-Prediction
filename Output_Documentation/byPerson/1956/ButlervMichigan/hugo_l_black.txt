that's
your

i
assume
you
concede
that's
your

of
this

l.
black
you're
--
you're
going
a
long
way,
it
looks
like,
in
connection
with
some
other
cases
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
are
written
in
this
field.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
you
wouldn't
have
taken
the
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
it
mean?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that's
a
vague
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
a
clear,
constitutionally
clear
description,

less
(voice

justice

if
that's
true,
why,
on
your
argument,
could
you
trust
the
good
jurors
on
immoral,
lewd
or
lascivious?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
could
--
you
could
--
do
you
think
you
could
trust
them
less
to
charge
on
that
and
you
could
on
obscene?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
maybe
obscene,
maybe
you
could
do
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
has
been
done.
and
i've
--
i've
had
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
other
has
--
the
other
has
been
done
too,
hasn't
it?

l.
black
there
are
many
statutes
throughout
the
country
that
--
that
relates
to
what's

they
not,
and
lewd
and
lascivious?
justice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
there
have
been
sufficient,

black
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice

what
i
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
interested
in
is,
how
would
you
qualify
an
expert
in
this
field?
what
--
what's
the
experience
do
they
have
to
have
different
from
other
people
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
be
an
expert
in
censorship.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
are
they
determining
whether
books
should
be
sensitive?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
what
was
the
--
what
did
they
qualify
--
what
was
he
an
expert
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
i
understand,
what
were
they?
professors
of
literature
or
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
anything
else
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black

to
know

l.
black
--
(voice

of
educations,
(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
incidence,
it
covers
40
pages
in
the
500-page
book.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
incidence
then
instead
to
cover
40
pages
on
a
500-page
book
and
your
recorder
decides
that
the
book
as
a
whole
is
immoral,
obscene,
and
so
forth.
what
about
that?
does
that
settle
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
incidence
is
only
five
pages
and
he
decides
that
it's
--
that
as
a
whole.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
know.

where
does
it
stand

guilty
on
the
old
statute
of
violating
that
law.
