but
he
wouldn't

testify

what

you
are
going

discuss
them.
unknown

at
this
time,
you
go
as
far
as
that.
unknown

well,
you
read
the
statute
differently
because
you
are
assigned
to
it.

and
you

and
we're
not
bound

what
this

said

of
your

that

if
your
interpretation
of
the
statute
then
it
--
that
if
he
merely
found
that
the
particular
passage
was
obscene,
that
doesn't
violate
the
statute.
unknown

if
your
interpretation
of
the
statute
as
i
take
it
that
if
he
merely
follows
the
passage
per
se
and
of
itself
was
obscene
that's
not
enough
to
violate
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
you
think,
they
read
the
context
and
the
book
as
a
whole,
personally.
unknown
speaker
and
if
we
can
read
this
statute
that
way
in
spite
of
what
the
district
judge
said.
unknown

would
it
--
would
it
be
proper
to
say
that
i
think
it
has
been
said
in
some
of
the
cases
that
one
must
find
that
the
dominant
purpose
of
the
writer
was
obscenity?
unknown
speaker
but
the
whole
book
might
be
obscene
but
it
might
be
a
work
in
literature
such
as
innocent
adolescence.
certainly,
it
wasn't
in
a
five-cent
copy
or
a
10-cent
copy
would
be
probably
wholly
obscene.
