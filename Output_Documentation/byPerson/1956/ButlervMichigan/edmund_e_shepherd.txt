mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
as
i
understand
the
word
"obscene",
take
it
from
the
dictionary,
it
is
that
which
is
offensive
to
chastity
of
mind
or
in
modesty
expressing
to
the
mind
or
abuse
something
that
delicacy,
purity
and
decency
forbids
to
be
exposed.
and
in
my
view,
that
word
is
not
only
well
understood,
it
is
somewhat
elastic
in
its
content
from
age
to
age
and
maybe
in
different
localities.
and
my
definition
of
obscenity
would
be
that
it
is
something
which
offends
the
conscience
of
the
community
and
that
the
final
arbiter,
in
determining
whether
a
book
is
obscene,
is
the
jury.
now
in
--
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
--
one
of
--
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
is
jury
of
the
community
--
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
--
is
the
arbiter
of
the
conscience
of
that
community.
now,
we
have
one
case,
although
only
three
which
have,
in
any
manner,
vest
upon
this
statute,
that
is
the
supreme
court
in
michigan
passed
upon,
people
v
lathers
223
michigan
92.
in
that
case,
publisher
of
a
newspaper
was
taxed
under
this
very
law
with
publishing
a
story,
i
think,
double
meaning.
the
judge,
the
trial
judge
took
the
question
from
the
jury
and
told
them
that,
without
going
to
their
jury
room,
they
should
render
a
verdict
of
guilty.
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
reversed
that
case
on
their
judgment
on
the
ground
that
the
defendant
was
entitled
to
go
to
the
jury
on
the
question
of
obscenity.
now,
i'm
not
going
to
dwell
very
long
on
this
question
of
vagueness
because
i
want
to
come
to
that
word
"containing".
i
--
i
can't
personally
see
anything
vague
or
indefinite
about
this
statute.
i
have
convinced
that,
leaving
out
a
lot
of
extraneous
matter,
this
rather
lengthy
section
to
read
this
way.
as
far
as
it
is
applicable
to
the
x
in
this
case,
any
person
who
shall
sell
any
book
containing
obscene
descriptions
tending
to
incite
minors
to
violent
or
depraved
or
immoral
acts,
and
i
insert
the
disjunctive
there,
or
tending
to
the
corruption
of
the
morals
of
youth
shall
be
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor.
now,
for
the
life
of
me,
i
can't
see
anything
vague
or
indefinite
in
--
in
that
language
because
the
--
the
keyword
there
is
this
word
"obscenity"
as
the
dictionary
defines
it
and
merely
because
you
have
phrases
added
to
that
doesn't
deprive
the
person
of
his
constitutional
rights
because
it's
all
hooked
up
to
that
keyword.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
i
--
i
do
not
apprehend
that
it
requires
proof
in
each
particular
case
of
some
special
effect
on
children
or
--
or
youths.
i
don't
think
that
is
true.
and
as
i
read
it,
i
think
that
any
obscene
description,
such
as
we
find
in
this
book,
would
tend
to
the
corruption
of
the
morals
of
youth.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
more
or
less,
i
would
say
or
descriptive.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
the
statute,
as
originally
enacted,
read
this
way,
obscene
descriptions
tending
to
the
corruption
of
the
morals
of
youth.
in
1954,
this
other
clause
or
phrase
was
added
"tending
to
incite
minors
to
violent
or
depraved
or
immoral
acts".
that
--
that
was
added
in
the
amendment
in
1954.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
yes.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
i'll
try
to.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
i
would
like
mr.
chief
justice
to
answer
your
last
question.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
and
at
the
same
time
to
reanswer
a
question
from
associate
justice
brennan.
michigan
has
no
record
of
legislative
history
for
being
possibly
to
tell
just
why
that
amendment
was
enacted.
my
guess
would
be
and
it's
merely
a
guess
or
a
suggestion
that
that
additional
phrase
or
clause
was
put
in
there
because
of
the
increase
in
juvenile
delinquency
of
which
we
are
all
aware.
now
if
i
might
digress
in
the
record
just
to
give
you
an
illustration
of
that,
the
other
day
just
before
i
let
--
i
had
occasioned
to
visit
the
state
police
post.
and
there
for
the
first
time
i
observed
polygraph
test
of
a
young
man
19
years
of
age,
accused
of
statutory
rape
on
a
13-year
old
girl.
and
i
watched
that
and
i
observed
his
answers
and
he
didn't
confess,
i
understand
he
did
live.
but
the
horrible
part
of
it
was
that
at
the
same
time
six
others
were
awaiting
a
similar
test
for
statutory
rape
on
the
same
13-year
old
girl.
so
it
maybe
that
acts
of
that
kind
induce
the
legislature
to
amend
the
statute.
now,
coming
back
to
my
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
brennan
--
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
that
might
be
true.
now,
logically
i
passed
to
reanswering
this
other
question.
i
do
not
think
that
under
the
--
the
statute
and
in
each
particular
case,
you
have
to
prove
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
some
particular
youth,
a
boy
or
a
man
was
led
to
commit
some
act
of
deprivation.
i
think
that
the
--
the
case,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
issue
of
fact
would
be
the
matter
contained
in
the
book
with
the
matter
contained
in
the
book
tends
to
do
these
things.
so
that
as
in
this
case,
the
recorder's
court
judge
resolved
the
issue
of
fact
but
finding
as
i
view
this
record
that
taking
the
book
as
a
whole
and
having
read
of
it,
it
is
obscene
within
this
definition.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
definitely
not
the
expensive
maybe
tedious.
just
for
a
few
minutes,
i
want
to
take
you
to
this
record
and
show
you
just
why
i
--
i
make
that
contention.
at
the
outset,
a
motion
was
filed
to
--
on
--
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
the
motion
is
filed
to
dismiss.
and
on
page
16
of
the
record
there
are
some
discussion
about
that
in
which
the
recorder's
judge
reserves
his
decision
on
that
motion.
and
he
didn't
pass
upon
it
until
the
end
of
the
trial.
now,
he
says
among
other
things
in
regard
to
that.
now
i
would
like
first
to
meet
on
--
i
would
like
first
to
meet
with
counsel
because
after
all,
some
of
these
passages
are
delicate.
some
of
these
passages,
i
don't
mind
telling
you,
so
far
as
i
am
only
on
page
123,
referring
to
the
book,
and
there
are
over
500
pages.
and
many
continues
i
was
pleased
that
the
book
was
handed
to
me
before
the
case
commenced,
which
clearly
indicates
that
at
that
time,
when
the
motion
was
under
consideration,
he
intended
to
read
the
whole
book.
now,
the
court
will
turn
to
page
23,
you
will
find
that
at
that
point
in
the
case,
during
the
receiving
of
testimony,
these
excerpts
were
introduced
in
evidence.
and
what
the
court
said
there
clearly
indicates
that
he
did
not
intend
to
judge
the
book
alone
on
those
excerpts,
because
he
says
that
the
court
takes
this
position
at
this
time.
i
have
not
read
the
complete
book.
i
intend
to.
now
whether
i
base
my
decision
on
the
complete
book
afterwards
or
the
excerpts
contained
in
there
will
be
a
matter
of
my
opinion,
or
my
opinion
there.
so,
he
passes
thereby
and
he
introduces
the
excerpts
solely
for
the
purpose
of
identification,
not
that
he
may
judge
it
but
that
he
--
that
they
may,
as
he
says,
save
a
lot
of
time
marking
at
the
book
and
the
page
references,
and
so
forth.
now
on
page
29,
again
he
reserves
the
decision
on
the
motion
and
clearly
indicates
that
he
is
going
to
read
this
whole
book
and
he
says
that
he
is
just
a
slow
reader,
reads
books
very
slowly
or
your
excerpts
very
slowly
or
your
briefs
very
slowly.
i
do
not
--
i
do
not
know
that
i
have
not
completed
reading
anything
but
the
brief
and
the
motion.
i
have
read
part
of
the
book
and
i've
read
part
of
these
excerpts.
so
he's
progressing,
maybe
somewhat
slowly.
now
on
page
32,
we
come
to
the
point
where
they
are
about
to
introduce
expert
testimony
on
the
literary
value
of
the
book
and
whether
or
not
this
or
rather
by
passages
which
earned
the
scrutiny
here
or
essential
to
the
theme.
and
he
clearly
indicates
that
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
--
of
admitting
that
testimony.
now
we
turn
to
page
58
and
59
of
the
record.
again
on
expert
testimony
and
showing
just
how
the
court's
mind
is
working
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
for
the
whole
report.
without
objecting
any
further,
my
ruling
would
be
the
same
on
both
issues.
it
would
be
perhaps
the
court
and
the
literary
issue
and
go
be
of
help
to
the
court
and
the
interpretation
of
the
statute.
i
am
going
to
permit
people
who
claim
to
know
what
it's
all
about
to
testify
in
this
case.that
would
apply
to
both
sides.
now
i
want
to
point
out
just
one
thing
here
in
passing.
judge
ricker
(ph)
admitted
in
evidence
and
received
in
evidence
testimony
adduced
from
experts
on
literary
values.
experts
who
have
read
this
entire
book
and
who
testified
what
if
these
episodes
were
essential
to
the
main
object
or
theme,
he
would
not
permit
testimony
as
to
whether
in
the
opinion
of
any
witness,
the
passages
were
obscene
or
the
book
was
obscene
because
as
he
held
right
and
wrong,
(inaudible)
usurped
is
judicial
function
in
passing
on
those
questions.
now,
on
page
77
--
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
whether
it
was
--
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
he
--
he
would
let
them
testify
as
to
whether
or
not
these
passages
were
essential
to
the
main
theme
of
the
book,
this
conflict
between
the
spiritual
and
physical.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
now
--
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
no,
no
your
honor.
he
--
he
avoided
that
most
carefully
as
i
read
this
record.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
no,
i
don't
believe
so.
it
may
--
one
or
two
questions
from
you
slipped
in
and
had
been
answered
but
take
it
by
and
large
he
carefully
excluded
any
expert
testimony
on
the
issue
which
he
himself
is
to
determine.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
he
said
that,
yes,
but
i
think
--
i
can't
point
to
pages
but
his
--
his
general
approach
or
philosophy
was
if
that
is
a
question
after
all
for
him
to
--
to
determine.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
you
mean
as
to
literary
value.
there
--
there
were
a
number
of
professors
and
book
reviewers
on
each
side
who
--
who
testified
that
for
the
--
for
the
dependants,
the
respondent
testified
that
in
their
opinion
it
was
a
beautifully
written
book.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
yes.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
well,
as
to
--
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
well,
not
in
censorship.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
no.
i
don't
think
that
was
the
point,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
that
was
the
issue.
i
don't
think
that
was
the
point
on
which
they
testified.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
he
was
an
expert
--
they
were
experts
on
--
on
books
and
on
literary
values
and
the
--
the
gist
of
the
testimony
of
witnesses
for
the
defendant
was
this.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
professors
of
literature
in
colleges
and
--
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
that
they
had
--
that
they
had
reviewed
different
books,
and
that
sort
of
thing.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
well,
not
all
of
them.
we
produced
for
instance
doctor
adler
of
the
theological
college
in
new
york.
we
produced
--
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
jewish
theological
college
of
new
york.
they
teach
(inaudible).
and
we
also
--
we
had
a
bishop
of
an
african
church
and
we
had
a
father,
a
priest
in
the
catholic
faith,
who
said
they
had
read
books,
they
had
made
the
practice
of
criticism
of
books
and
that
they
were
versed
in
literary
values
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
you
see,
that
--
that
--
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
--
that
was
--
that
your
honor
please
was
the
only
issue
of
fact
in
this
case
as
to
the
testimony
developed.
now
on
page
77,
it
shows,
i
think,
that
the
court
was
then
studying
this
book
very
carefully
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
now
just
to
clarify
this,
the
conflict
continues
throughout
the
entire
book.
it's
a
conflict
between
the
physical
and
the
spiritual.
and
finally
the
spiritual
wins
out.
it
said,
it
is
questioning
a
witness
here,
he
shows
interest.
yes,
your
honor,
i
am
trying
to
distinguish
which
between
spiritual
passion
and
sexual
passion.
the
court
throughout
the
book
it
starts
and
varies
in
degrees
i
get
it
and
then
spiritual
wins
out
and
that's
his
evident
--
quite
evidently,
he
is
taking
a
great
interest
in
it
and
has
written
the
book.
now,
i
could
refer
through
any
number
of
page
citations
here
but
i
turn
to
page
171
of
the
transcript
of
record
in
which
the
court
says
however,
the
courts
will
permit
it
as
i
see
it
the
testimony
as
to
whether
the
material
contained
in
there
is
of
such
literary
value.
as
to
justify
these
particular
passages,
there
might
be
immoral,
nude,
lascivious,
and
obscene.
so
i
am
going
to
ask
you
again
(inaudible),
if
you
feel
that
some
of
the
materials
in
there
is
justified
by
the
literary
value
of
the
book,
can
you
answer
that?
so
it
shows
that
each
following
true
on
that
--
on
that
carrier.
it
clearly
indicates
that
he
has
read
the
book
and
is
judging
it,
then
just
that
way.
there
is
another
question
which
he
propounds
to
witness
on
page
179
and
i
will
continue
on
page
180
where
they
confront.
you
think
that
the
literary
value
of
the
book
would
have
been
impaired
at
all
by
removing
or
changing
some
of
those
parts
in
the
book.
that,
well
particularly
in
the
very
description
of
the
--
let's
call
it
sensual
rather
than
sexual
act.
do
you
think
the
literary
value
would
have
been
destroyed
if
some
of
those
were
changed?
and
so
currently
--
idea
of
a
literary
value,
i'd
say
no.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
that's
on
page
179,
if
your
honor
please.
then
on
page
180
just
a
little
short
quotation
down
at
the
bottom,
it's
a
--
they've
examined
father
(inaudible),
i'm
right
in
that
pronunciation.
the
court
says,
“now
wait,
i
have
read
the
book.
i
would
be
terribly
shocked
if
father
(inaudible)
had
answered
that
any
other
way
than
he
had."
and
again
on
page
188,
i
hope
i'm
not
too
tedious,
i
think
it's
at
the
utmost
importance.
another
witness
on
the
stand,
the
court
says
on
the
matter
of
obscenity
nor
salacious
literature.
he
has
as
i
said
received
disqualifications
and
it
goes
to
the
degree
rather
than
the
admissibility.
so
the
court
will
ask
you,
do
you
think
that
the
passages
could
be
eliminated,
so
rephrased
without
effect
--
without
affecting
the
literary
value
of
the
book.
and
the
colloquy
goes
on
between
the
court
and
the
witness.
our
counsel
has
already
gone
over
this
opinion
which
the
court
read
and
i
think
he
followed
--
to
be
followed
both
(inaudible)
and
drawn
on
the
modern
rule
but
at
any
rate
it's
quite
clear
to
me
that
he
did
after
reading
this
book
comes
the
conclusion
that
those
passages,
obscene
passages,
were
not
essential.
they're
overstressed,
they're
overemphasized,
and
that
therefore,
the
book
as
a
whole
was
clearly
obscene.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
well
am
i
rather
doubted
to
you
get
a
great
deal
of
light
on
statutory
construction
for
reading
the
opinion.
i
think
that
what
the
judge
was
doing
here
in
the
sole
function
when
she
performed
was
to
resolve
the
issue
of
fact.
are
these
particular
passages
obscene?
yes,
they
are.
now
if
they're
obscene,
you
integrate
them
to
the
whole
of
the
book,
does
the
make
the
book
obscene?
does
the
book
contain
obscene
passages
applying
the
modern
rule,
and
that
would
be
my
view.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
yes,
sir.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
yes,
sir.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
that's
right.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
it's
discretionary.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
by
the
prosecutor.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
that
particularly
statute
is
under
observation
to
my
knowledge
(voice

--
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
yes,
sir.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
yes,
sir.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
yes.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
the
only
case
that
--
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
yes.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
well,
i
mean
that
has
never
been
construed
by
our
supreme
court.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
never,
except
when
they
held
on
the
little's
case
that
the
--
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
--
a
defendant
was
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
yes,
that's
--
yes.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
it
don't.
that's
right.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
not
on
this
particular
subject
of
obscenity,
no
your
honor.
statutes
went
on
--
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
i
don't
think
the
recorder
said
an
awful
lot
of
them
and
how
that
language
should
be
construed,
he
don't
call
it,
he
--
he
simply
decided
the
question
on
the
--
of
fact
as
i
view.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
no
guidance
from
our
supreme
courts
your
honor,
please.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
i
am
sure
--
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
i'm
sure
your
capable
of
doing
that,
your
honor,
mr.
frankfurter.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
wasn't
it
--
wasn't
it
mr.
justice
jackson
who
said
that
you
do
not
sit
as
a
super
bar
of
censors,
is
that
what
you
have
in
mind?
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
well,
i
think
--
i
think
that
these
--
that
these
passages
sir,
excerpts
if
you
do
want
to
call
them
that,
are
so
foul
and
so
filthy,
maybe
it's
my
puritanical
ancestors
coming
out
here
and
my
very
dear
victorian
aunt
who
chatted
me
once
for
referring
to
legs
into
the
limbs.
but
i
think
this
thing
--
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
i
--
i
hope
so.
i
hope
so.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
well,
i
turn
to
a
couple
of
cases,
i
believe
from
ohio,
your
honor
please.
they
are
cited
in
my
brother's
brief.
we
have
a
situation,
an
argument
or
a
statute
provides
that
--
it
reads
not
wholly
obscene
but
contained
certain
description.
it's
not
wholly
obscene
but
contained
--
or
you
might
have
a
law
which
says
containing
any
obscene
merit.
you
might
have
a
different
problem
there.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
oh,
no.
any
book
which
has
salacious
descriptions
or
obscene
descriptions,
then
it
certainly
contains
it.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
i
do,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
well,
i
have
the
utmost
respect
for
the
recorder's
court.
it's
a
court
--
it's
a
court
of
record.
it
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
all
crimes
committed
within
the
city
of
detroit.
it
has
a
court
reporter
and
all
that
sort
of
thing.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
but
--
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
pardon?
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
well,
maybe
i
don't
make
myself
clear.
i
think
the
only
question
and
that
that
court
decided
was
one
effect
and
i
think
in
deciding
or
resolving
that
issue,
he
used
modern
rule.
he
may
have
decided
that
these
excerpts
were
obscene,
obscene
description.
but
i
think
he
also
held
that
integrating,
the
myriad
integrating
into
the
book
that
the
book
itself
was
obscene.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
i
don't
understand
that.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
no,
i
think
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
personally,
i
think
that
you
should
judge
the
book
as
a
whole
or
you
want
to
follow
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
that's
the
way
i
read
it.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
that's
right.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
i
--
i
agree
with
judge
hand
on
that.
i
do.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
(inaudible)
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
certainly.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
i
think
so,
as
i
read
this
entire
record.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
you
don't
take
the
marginal
cases.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
marginal
cases
or
maybe
the
case
later
on
or
--
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
no.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
that's
right.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
that's
right.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
pardon
your
honor?
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
i
think
that
settles
the
issue
of
faith,
of
course
they
didn't
go
--
they
can
go
to
a
jury.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
well,
this
is
more
than
five
pages.
you're
reaching
a
marginal
case.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
we
might
run
into
trouble
with
the
case
of
that
kind
but
--
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
well
--
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
with
the
rape
of
lucrece,
i
think
if
you
put
the
rape
of
lucrece
in
a
paper
covered
book
and
sold
it
through
drugstore
outlets,
it
might
be
considered
salacious
or
obscene,
maybe.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
if
it
were
sold
through
those
channels
or
to
children
as
notoriously
congregate.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
that's
right.
the
conscience
of
the
community
speaking
through
its
--
through
the
jury.
thank
you
for
your
attention.
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
i
think
that's
the
--
that's
the
basis
of
the
whole
book
rule,
is
it
not
dominant?
mr.
edmund
e.
shepherd
it
may.
it's
quite
a
problem.
we
submit
this
--
