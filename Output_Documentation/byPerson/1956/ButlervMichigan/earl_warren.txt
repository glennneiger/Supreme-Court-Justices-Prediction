does
the

or

without

--
without

you
concede

mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
do
the
statute
always
have
that
provision
in
about

--

warren
--
you
could
tell

before
you
answer
that
one,
mr.

i
--
i
wondered
if
--
if
in
passing
this
amendment,
your
legislature
thought
that
perhaps
it
had
to
put
another
definition.
it
created
another
standard
let's
say
or
another
type
of
obscenity
in
order
to
be
able
to
convict
people.

justice
earl
warren
you
say,
he
would
not
let
the
experts
testify
as
to
whether
in
their
opinion
the
book
itself
was
obscene.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
shepherd,
would
you
mind
the
court
--
would
you
mind
talking
closer
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
the
microphone
so
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
so
all
can
hear?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
all
right.
you
don't
need
to
follow
that,
just
to
the
end.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
robbins,
do
you
have
anything
more?
very
well.
