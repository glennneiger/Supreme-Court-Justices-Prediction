you
mean
counting
those
words?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
express
--
just
as
your
expression
that
you
could
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
just
want
to
--
justice

frankfurter
(voice

whether

and
to
infer
from
that
that
you
would
regard
the

"obscene"
period,
as
satisfying
the

justice

justice

but
that's
a
very

question
from
whether

make

he

does
the

sufficiently
is
not
offending
against
the
ruling

justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
one
has
not
to
look
at
any
book
just
the
statute
can
save.
the
statue
itself
is
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
no
--
no,
that's
a
different
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i'm
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
don't
you
go
to
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
don't
you
take
us
to
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
as
i
understood
you,
the
defect
here
is
in
the
statute,
isn't
it?
you
started
out
by
saying
this
is
not
an
ordinary
obscenity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
you're
attacking
on
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
go
to
the
statute
and
found
what
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
your
suggestion
that
the
statute
had
to
go
a
period
after
lewd,
lascivious
and
lawfully
immoral,
lewd
and
lascivious
prints,
pictures,
figures
or
description
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
period.
it
doesn't
appear
you
have
no
quarrel
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
i
--
i'm
not
challenging
anything.
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
mean,
mr.
robbins,
that
in
a
book
containing
570
odd
pages,
under
the
construction
given
by
the
state
court
to
the
statute
and
the
statute
comes
here
as
though
that
construction
were
written
into
it,
if
a
book
of
570
pages,
if
the
prosecutor
in
michigan,
that
he
was
(inaudible)
about
it,
as
i
understand
it,
if
you
have
a
book
of
575
pages,
prosecutor
can
say
if
there
are
three
pages
that
are
obscene
and
tend
to
do
these
things
that
he
can
rest
and
he
makes
out
of
the
case,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
statute
plus
the
construction
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
you
are
contending
and
rightly
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
it
comes
here
with
an
authoritative
construction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
if
he
does
call
out
of
this
--
this
or
any
other
book
by
the
70
pages
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
three
pages,
never
mind
what

what
the
context
of
those
three
pages
and
the

pages
before
or
after
may
due
to
those
(inaudible)
justice

frankfurter
and
your
position
is
that
a
statute
which
does
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
case
get
down
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice

no,
no,
i

i
didn't

it's

it's

isn't
it?
justice

yes.
famous

--

famous

justice

you
think
those
qualifications
rendered
the

vague?
justice

they
take
away
--
they
take
away
without
credence
with
the

"obscene"?
justice

and
you
say
that
those
qualifying
words
used
the
otherwise
clear

of
obscenity
to
the
point
of
vagueness
making

have
it

the

justice

do
you

it's

in

the

that
may
satisfy
the

requirement
even
though,
you
may
not

able
to
give
an

justice

and
you
trust
the
judgment
of
what
supposed
to

justice

i
suggest,
you

it
has
been
done.
justice

the

--
justice

frankfurter
before
you
sit
down,
i
just
want
to
ask
you
one
question.
at
before
your
remark,
what
i
think
the
(inaudible)
a
little
awhile
ago,
you're
familiar
with
cases
that
give
respect
--
weigh
the
fact
of
the
statute
is
familiar
or
old,
isn't
that
right?
you
said
something
about
it.
justice

so
it
has
behind

the

(inaudible)
justice

the
thing
regarding
obscenity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

now,
that's
what
i
meant
by
age.
but
why?
i
notice
in
taking
mr.

brief
that
this
statute
long
antedate
the

michigan
anticipated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
and
this
goes
back
to
a
hundred
years
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

say
about
that?
one
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
may
be
an
admirable
argument
in
regress
to
modern
clubs
and
legislatures
if
it's
conclusive
on
the
court
but
the
court
had
the
last
word
on
what
is
deemed
modern?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
that
concludes
the
matter,
i
say
it's
very
important.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
we
have
a
scale
on
which
we
could
weigh
it,
that
--
that
would
be
easy
but
this
all
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

about
judgement
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
which
age
the
longevity
of
the
statute
has,
for
one
member
of
the
(inaudible)
good
deal
of
weight.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
everything
that's
new
isn't
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
shepherd,
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
was
an
application
for
leave
to
appeal
from
the
recorder's
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
your
supreme
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
which
you've
realized
directly
as
i
understand
it.
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
condition
by
the
defendants
to
secure
a
review
from
the
supreme
court
was
consented
by
the
people.
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
the
prosecutor.
the
people
agree,
a
i
read
their
memorandum,
that
because
the
issues
involved
in
this
occasion
are
of
great
public
interest
and
because
it
appears
with
further
clarification
in
the
language
of
section
so
and
so
and
amended
(inaudible)
application
for
leave
to
appeal
would
be
granted.
despite
this
consented
application,
your
supreme
court
did
deny
the
application
and
did
not
leave
that
the
case
called
for
further
clarification.
now,
what
i
want
to
know
from
you
is
this.
as
i
take
it,
our
first
inquiries,
what
is
the
scope
of
the
statute?
what
--
what
is
the
authoritative
meaning
of
this
statute
which
we
must
take
from
your
supreme
court?
what
i
want
to
know
from
you
as
the
first
one,
from
the
statute
(inaudible)
what
i
want
to
know
from
you,
mr.
shepherd
is,
to
what
decisions
--
what
decisions
other
than
what
the
recorder
here
brought,
what
decision
would
your
supreme
court
will
you
refer
me
to
enable
me
to
ascertain
what
i
must
take
as
the
settled
and
controlling
medium
of
the
statute
on
the
basis
on
which
i
must
decide
whether
it
does
or
doesn't
depend
to
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
all
you
can
say
that
that
statute
has
been
under
observation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
has
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that,
i
should
think
that
case
was
easy
because
that
specifically
says,
the
little
case
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
was
convicted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
i
don't
have
to
--
to
the
point
of
laziness
to
welcome
the
answer.
i
don't
have
to
read
any
precedence,
read
court
opinions
on
this
subject,
is
that
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
the
scope
is
except
as
applied
in
this
case
to
what
the
recorder
said,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
then
is
my
--
then
that's
your
answer
to
my
question
that
i
might
put
on
this
(inaudible)
a
question
away
because
that's
the
way
i
have
to
reach
the
result.
it's
my
job
then
to
read
this
book,
as
yet
i'm
fully
innocent
of
its
content.
i
have
to
read
this
book
and
take
myself
while
they
upheld
this
is
within
the
statute,
therefore,
the
statute
covers
a
thing
like
this
and
i
must
decide
a
thing
like
this
if
that's
made
of
a
crime
whether
that
may
or
may
not
commit
a
crime
by
michigan,
is
that
it?
can
i
get
no
guidance
from
your
supreme
court
opinions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
to
get
it
all
out
of
my
own
head
and
my
knowledge
of
reading
anything.
justice
felix
frankfurter
find
out
things
of
what
this
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
but
i
can't
make
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
would
that
enable
me
--
can
i
just
close
that
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
fully
on
that,
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
are
saying
is
in
spite
in
view
of
the
light,
in
view
of
the
light
(inaudible)?
and
what
you're
saying
is
that
we
have
to
consider
this
as
a
simple
unqualified
statute
to
make
into
a
sentence
to
tell
obscene
literature
seriously.
and
further
that
there
is
to
be
incorporated
the
rules
that
in
determining
our
representative,
the
publication
in
its
entire
as
a
whole,
you
can't
tear
out
a
page
or
two
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
your
--
that
that's
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understood.
that's
--
that
is
under
a
different
statute.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
--
you're
saying
that
exactly
to
me
although
the
michigan
supreme
court
hasn't
got
much
of
the
authoritative
light,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
to
add
one
more
relevance,
mr.
shepherd,
and
the
jury
must
still
find
it.
