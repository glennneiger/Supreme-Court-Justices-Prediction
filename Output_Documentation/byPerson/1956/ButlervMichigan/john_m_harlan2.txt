well,
then
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
doesn't
the
--
doesn't
the
first
sentence
in
the
first
paragraph
throw
some
light
on
what
he
was
doing
or
he
says,
"so
--
justice
john
m.
harlan

so
that
if
therefore
--
so
that
if
therefore,
if
there
ever
is
a
reveal
of
my
decision
in
this
matter,
i
am
not
trying
in
any
way
to
evade
the
issue,
i
am
trying
to
follow
the
statute
as
it
is".
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
if
the
statute
was
limited
to
sales
of
such
books
to
minor,
you'd
have
a
different
case,
wouldn't
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
want
to
debate
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
would
--
it
would
be
different.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
didn't
say
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
i
said
difference.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
wonder
really
whether
what
you've
been
through
mr.
solicitor
general,
throws
any
real
light
on
what
the
opinion
means
because
the
threshold
of
all
these,
he
specifically
says
that
he's
going
to
decide
on
one
basis
or
the
other
excerpts
or
the
book
as
a
whole
in
his
opinion.
from
where
you
began
--
began
there
on
page
23
before
he
did
as
he
undoubtedly
did
read
the
whole
book,
he
says
now
whether
i
base
my
decision
on
the
complete
book
afterwards
or
the
excerpts
contained
in
there
will
be
a
matter
for
my
opinion
there.
and
you
don't
really
get
any
light
on
anything
until
you
reach
the
opinion,
do
you?
