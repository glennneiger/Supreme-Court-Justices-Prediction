mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
may
it
please
the
court.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
like
to
make
a
brief
review
of
the
facts
of
this
case.
in
1953,
petitioner,
mr.
christianson
and
mr.
paster
were
indicted
and
tried
for
the
crime
of
conspiring
to
violate
the
johnson
act,
which
prohibits
the
interstate
shipment
of
gambling
devices.
as
a
result
of
that
trial,
petitioner
was
acquitted.
the
jury
disagreed
as
to
mr.
christianson
and
mr.
paster.
the
following
year,
the
government
retried
the
case
against
mr.
christianson
and
mr.
paster.
in
preparing
for
the
retrial
of
the
christianson
case,
the
government
procured
the
issuance
of
subpoena
duces
tecum
no.
160.
that
subpoena
was
issued
on
march
the
25th,
returnable
march
the
29th,
the
date
set
for
the
beginning
of
the
christianson
retrial.
on
march
the
29th,
mr.
paster
moved
to
quash
the
subpoena.
the
motion
was
denied
and
the
district
judge
vogel
issued
an
order
compelling
the
mayflower
distributing
company
to
whom
the
subpoena
had
been
directed
to
forthwith
comply.
on
april
the
1st,
mayflower
distributing
company
purported
to
comply
with
the
subpoena
through
petitioner,
the
vice
president
of
mayflower.
at
a
hearing
in
judge's
chambers
on
the
return
of
subpoena
160,
petitioner
was
put
under
oath
and
testified
concerning
the
return.
the
court,
dissatisfied
with
his
testimony,
issued
an
impounding
order
directing
the
marshal
of
north
dakota
to
impound
the
records
of
mayflower
distributing
company
in
st.
paul.
that
order
was
issued
and
the
records
were
impounded.
the
christianson
retrial
proceeded
to
a
conclusion.
a
determination
of
the
christianson
retrial,
the
court
sua
sponte
issued
an
order
to
show
cause
why
petitioner
should
not
be
cited
for
contempt
and
set
forth
three
specifications.
specification
1,
charged
him
with
contempt
for
false
and
evasive
testimony.
specification
2,
charged
him
with
contempt
in
disobedience
of
another
subpoena,
subpoena
78
and
specification
3,
charged
contempt
in
disobedience
of
subpoena
no.
160.
the
show
cause
order
was
issued
april
23rd.
it
was
set
down
for
a
hearing
on
april
27th.
on
the
morning
of
april
27th,
petitioner
asked
for
an
extension
of
time
which
was
granted
until
3
o'clock
that
afternoon.
at
termination
of
the
afternoon
hearing,
the
court
found
petitioner
guilty
of
contempt
on
all
three
specifications
and
sentenced
him
to
one
year
and
a
day.
petitioner
took
an
appeal
to
the
eighth
circuit.
while
the
case
was
pending
in
the
eighth
circuit,
the
government
filed
a
supplemental
record.
that
supplemental
record
was
discussed
at
great
length
last
thursday.
the
supplemental
record
is
the
last
half
of
the
record
now
before
this
court.
it
consists
of
68
pages.

to

of
the

now,
this
supplementary

involves
the

of
the

your

with

this
supplemental

involves
the
indictment
against
christianson,
paster,
and
petitioner.
it
involves
a
modified
indictment,
carries
the
motion
to
quash
the
subpoenas
filed
by
paster
at
the
beginning
of
the
christianson
retrial.
it
carries

hearing,

correction,
your
honor.
it
involves
a
list
of
the
exhibits
introduced
by
petitioner
at
the
contempt
hearing.
petitioner
in
his
motion
to
strike
certain
portions
of
this
supplementary
record
before
the
court
of
appeals
took
no
objection
to
the
inclusion
of
the
memorandum
opinion
of
judge
vogel
nor
did
he
take
objection
to
the
list
of
exhibits
which
he
had
introduced
during
the
contempt
hearing.
the
government
does
not
undertake
to
support
the
other
elements
in
the
supplemental
record
and
does
not
believe
they
are
germane
to
this
case.
the
government
doesn't
care
to
support
specification
no.1,
that
is
the
specification
charging
contempt
in
that
petitioner
--
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
yes,
your
honor.
we
feel
it's
not
germane
to
the
issue
on
this
case.
the
government
is
supporting
the
conviction
only
on
specification
3.
all
other
elements
in
the
supplemental
record
are
germane
to
specifications
no.1
and
2,
and
we
believe
they
have
no
relevancy
to
specification
3,
except
the
memorandum
opinion
and
petitioner's
list
of
exhibits
in
the
contempt
proceeding.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
which
are
not
objected
to.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
that's
right,
your
honor.
in
specification
no.1,
charging
contempt
in
that
petitioner
gave
false
and
evasive
testimony
the
obstructing
the
administration
of
justice,
the
government
believes
that
this
specification
is
controlled
by
in
re
michael
decided
by
this
court,
326
u.s.224.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
as
it
appears
before
this
court
to
indicate
that
the
obstruction
of
justice
arose
from
the
false
and
evasive
testimony
rather
it
appears
that
it
arose
from
the
non-production.
even
if
it
did
arise
from
the
false
and
evasive
testimony,
the
government
doesn't
believe
that
the
testimony
of
petitioner
was
adequately
falsified
or
proved
to
be
false
by
reliance
upon
the
testimony
of
f.b.i.
agent
peterson,
who
testified
during
the
christianson
retrial.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
if
the
testimony
--
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
i
say
--
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
the
government
doesn't
believe
that
--
the
testimony
of
petitioner
which
is
alleged
to
be
false
is
proved
to
be
false
either
by
the
presentation
of
the
impounded
records
in
court
or
by
the
testimony
of
f.b.i.
agent
peterson
who
testified
in
the
christianson
retrial.
to
use
agent
peterson's
testimony,
to
establish
the
falsity
of
petitioner's
testimony,
would
deprive
petitioner
of
an
opportunity
to
cross-examine
the
f.b.i.
agent
on
the
issue
of
the
truth
or
falsity
of
his
testimony.
for
that
reason,
the
government
doesn't
care
to
support
specification
no.1.
specification
--
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
i
will.
i
will
now
--
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
it
doesn't
flow
over
3
for
this
reason.
judge
vogel,
who
tried
the
contempt
proceeding,
heard
the
christianson
retrial.
now,
as
your
honor
mentioned
in
thursday,
he
does
have
the
advantage
of
knowing
all
of
the
facts.he
had
heard
peterson's
testimony
in
the
original.
the
introduction
of
peterson's
testimony
during
the
contempt
proceeding
was
nothing
new
to
the
judge.
it
could
not
have
prejudiced
him
in
his
view
of
the
case.
at
least
we
don't
feel
that
it
could.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
only
--
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
yes,
your
honor.
now,
the
only
judges
who
may
have
been
influenced
by
peterson's
testimony
were
the
court
of
appeals
who
saw
it
for
the
first
time.
but
the
court
of
appeals,
in
its
opinion,
set
forth
from
the
supplemental
record
on
page
76
viewed
the
testimony
of
agent
peterson
as
indicating
the
falsity
of
nilva's
testimony,
which
would
indicate
that
they
correlated
the
f.b.i.
agent's
testimony
to
specification
no.1.
there's
no
reference
made
to
correlating
it
to
specification
3
other
than
the
broad
statement
on
page
79
of
the
supplemental
record
in
which
they
say
that
there
is
no
reason
why,
under
the
circumstances
here
presented,
peterson's
testimony
was
not
equally
admissible
as
a
summarization
of
voluminous
records
in
both
the
christianson
case
and
the
contempt
proceedings.
well,
the
government
doesn't
support
that
allegation
--
that
statement,
your
honor.specification
no.2
charged
petitioner
with
contempt
and
that
he
was
disobedient
of
subpoena
78.
this
subpoena
78
was
directed
to
the
mayflower
distributing
company
and
required
the
production
of
records
pertaining
to
16
different
accounts
that
the
mayflower
distributing
company
had
with
its
customers.
specification
no.2
charges
petitioner
in
failing
to
produce
five
specific
items,
two
ledger
sheets
and
three
invoices
pertaining
to
accounts
with
mr.
sandy
and
mr.
bater.
in
order
to
establish
a
contempt
against
petitioner,
it
would
be
incumbent
upon
the
government
to
prove
the
issuance
and
service
of
the
subpoena
the
failure
to
comply
and
the
existence
of
the
documents
at
the
time
the
subpoena
was
served.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
which
would
indicate
that
the
records
called
for
or
mentioned
in
specification
no.2
were
actually
in
existence
at
the
time
subpoena
78
was
served.
but
if
we
may
revert
to
--
advert
to
the
supplemental
record
for
one
moment,
it
appears
from
the
supplemental
record
that
the
testimony
of
james
christianson,
a
bookkeeper
for
the
mayflower
distributing
company
indicates
clearly
there
is
a
strong
possibility
that
those
records
were
actually
destroyed
and
were
nonexistence
when
subpoena
78
was
served.
for
that
reason,
the
government
does
not
care
to
support
the
conviction
on
specification
2.
the
government
does
believe
that
the
specification
3
charges
a
contempt
and
a
conviction
can
be
supported
on
that
specification
alone.
subpoena
160,
which
underlies
specification
3,
is
set
forth
in
the
record
on
page
24
and
25.
it
clearly
--
it
is
addressed
to
the
mayflower
distributing
company.
it
clearly
calls
for
invoices,
bills,
checks,
slips,
papers,
records,
letters,
and
ledger
sheets
among
others.
it
is
limited
to
a
period
from
july
the
1st,
1950
through
april
30th,
1951.
it
reflects
--
those

are
the
reflect
purchases,
sales
and
trades
of
slot
machines,
flat-top
or
console,
coin-operated
device,
whether
new
or
used.
it
is
the
used
records
that
gave
rise
to
this
contempt
proceeding.
subpoena
160
was
served
upon
mayflower
distributing
company
in
march
the
25th.
it
was
delivered
to
the
secretary
walter
johnson.
it
called
for
a
return
march
the
29th,
the
day
the
christianson
retrial
began.
on
that
day,
mr.
paster,
president
of
mayflower
move
to
quash.
the
motion
was
overruled.
the
court
issued
a
forthwith
order
to
comply
with
the
subpoena
and
compliance
was
had
or
purported
to
be
had
on
april
the
1st
in
the
judges'
chambers.
the
proceedings
relative
to
the
april

are
set
forth
on

of

of

that's
right.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
april
1st,
1954.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
this
was
on
the
return
day
of
the

and
the
forthwith
was
ordered.
mr.

mr.
richard

blanchard
and
then,
they
move
to

--
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
--
which
motion
was
denied.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
the
court
then
entered
an
order
to
comply
forthwith
with
the
subpoenas.
compliance
was
attempted
on
april
1st.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
government
counsel
pointed
out
to
the
court
that
the
only
records
petitioner
had
turned
over
in
compliance
with
the
subpoena
were
records
dealing
with
the
purchase
of
new
machines.
petitioner's
counsel
said
there
were
other
records.
this
is
on
page
6
of
the
record,
"with
relation
to
the
use
of
secondhand
machines,
inventories
were
made
of
those
machines
and
were
furnished
to
the
attorney
general."
now,
the
inventories
of
used
slot
machines
furnished
to
the
attorney
general
were
made
under
the
johnson
act.
the
johnson
act
became
effective
january
2nd,
1951
and
returns,
commenced
in
july
the
1st,
1951.
government
counsel
pointed
out
that
the
inventories
which
were
furnished
to
the
attorney
general
would
be
inventories
of
used
machines
as
of
july.
that
is
on
page
7
of
the
record.
petitioner
said
that
they
had
only
compiled
records
of
used
slot
machines.
there
are
no
records
of
any
other
kind.
this
is
on
page
7.
i
brought
them
all
down.
i
got
everything
we
had.
on
page
8,
he
again
repeated.
he
brought
all
of
the
records
that
he
has
of
the
compiled
nature
of
used
machines.
when
government
counsel
questioned
the
use
of
the
word
“compiled”,
petitioner
said,
"there
was
nothing
other
than
what
appears
in
the
records
that
you
have
at
the
present
time
before
this
court."
government
counsel
dissatisfied
with
this
return
asked
the
petitioner
be
put
under
oath,
which
was
done.
on
page
9
of
the
record,
government
counsel
asked
petitioner
if
the
records
of
the
mayflower
distributing
company
incorporated
showed
the
purchase
of
secondhand
slot
machines
during
the
month
of
january
1951,
to
which
petitioner
answered,
"the
records
with
reference
to
that
matter
have
all
been
subpoenaed
and
are
in
evidence
in
the
appellate
court."
now,
that
has
reference
--
that
reference
of
the
appellate
court
pertains
to
another
case,
nilva
versus
united
states,
a
samuel
nilva.
petitioner
here
is
allen
nilva.
that
case
is
reported
at
212
f.2d
115.
when
government
counsel
again
repeated
the
same
question
concerning
the
records
of
mayflower
reflecting
slot
machines,
petitioner
answered,
"well,
i
don't
know.
i
can't
state
whether
they
do
or
do
not.
if
there
were
any
records,
i
know
that
the
records
were
subpoenaed."
that
raises
a
doubt
as
to
whether
it
remained
subpoenaed
in
this
case
or
that
they
were
subpoenaed
in
the
original
nilva.
i
think
it's
quite
--
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
on
page
10,
your
honor,
the
eighth
line
from
the
bottom.
i
think
it's
quite
plausible
to
interpret
that
as
meaning
that
petitioner
knew
that
records
of
secondhand
slot
machines
purchased
in
january
were
called
for
by
subpoena
no.160,
issued
in
this
case,
although
there's
still
room
to
view
it
as
pertaining
to
the
other
nilva
situation.
following
a
colloquy
between
counsel
and
attorneys
and
the
court,
mr.
dibble,
the
government
counsel
again
repeated
the
question,
“is
there
any
record
in
the
mayflower
distributing
incorporation
today?"
this
is
on
page
15.
in
their
possession
today,
which
would
reflect
the
purchase
of
secondhand
coin
machines,
slot
machines
during
a
month
of
february
1951
to
which
petitioner
answered,
"i
have
made
a
thorough
search
to
the
best
of
my
ability.”
and
he
concluded,
"had
been
unable
to
find
any
records
of
any
purchase
in
the
month
of
march
or
when
corrected,
in
the
month
of
february.”
when
asked
specifically
about
the
records
of
march
1951,
he
said,
"there
are
no
records."
on
page
16,
when
pushed
further
he
said,
“i
have
been
unable
to
find
the
records
you
refer
to.
there
are
no
records,
whatsoever.”
government
counsel
then
interrogated
him,
"did
you
examine
your
daily
ledger
sheet
for
the
months
of
january,
february,
march,
april
of
1951?"
to
which
petitioner
answered
"the
daily
ledger?
i
am
not
sure
whether
we
examined
the
daily
ledger,"
which
would
appear
to
be
the
basic
book
of
any
corporate
enterprise.
in
the
middle
of
page
17,
he
states
that
he
checked
all
incoming
invoices,
all
outgoing
invoices
that
we
had,
all
our
checks,
all.
well,
everything
that
had
anything
to
do
with
the
purchase
as
well
as
anything
that
had
anything
to
do
with
the
sales,
and
they're
still
speaking
of
used
slot
machines.
now,
on
page
20,
when
government
counsel
rephrased
his
question
and
instead
of
speaking
of
the
records
of
mayflower
as
showing
the
purchases,
he
put
it
in
terms
of
money.
he
said,
"if
i
had
sold
you
five
machines
during
the
month
of
january
in
1951
and
came
to
you
and
told
you
that
you
hadn't
paid
me
for
all
of
those,
do
you
have
any
records
that
will
show
to
the
contrary
in
the
mayflower
distributing
company?"
to
which
petitioner
answered,
"i
believe
that
we'd
have
that
record
on
your
account
just
like
bally.
bally
sold
those
machines,
that's
why
it
was
easy
to
find
any
matter
relating
to
bally
or
united
because
we
dealt
with
them
consistently.
we
have
the
records
of
their
running
accounts
and
it's
easy
to
find
out.
i
presume
that
would
be
easy."
it
was
then
the
government
counsel
announced
that
those
were
the
records
the
subpoena
called
for.
on
page
28
of
the
record
is
a
transcript
to
the
proceedings
before
the
court
in
a
contempt
proceeding.
the
show
cause
order
has
discharged
in
specification
3
that
petitioner
had
failed
to
produce
a
long
series
of
items.
i
will
focus
my
attention
only
on
items
a,
b,
c
and
d,
the
general
ledger
of
1950,
the
general
ledger
of
1951,
the
journal
of
1950
and
1951,
and
the
check
register
of
1950
and
1951.
this
show
cause
order
issued
april
23rd
came
on
for
hearing
april
27th.
the
court
opened
by
saying
that
the
burden
was
upon
petitioner
to
proceed.
that
we
understand
to
mean
the
burden
of
going
forward
with
the
case.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
yes.
to
which
--
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
on
the
third
specification
--
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
--
and
belief.
that's
right,
your
honor.
i
believe
the
evidence
in
the
record
on
those
four
items
is
enough
to
support
this
conviction
on
specification
3.
petitioner's
counsel
pointed
out
that
petitioner
was
not
the
moving
party
and
then
immediately
asked
for
further
time
to
prepare
the
defense.
he
believe
that
he
hadn't
been
given
adequate
time,
then
he
asked
for
a
bill
of
particulars
pertaining
to
specification
1
as
to
where
in
petitioner
had
committed
false
and
evasive
answers.
the
court
granted
an
extension
until
three
that
afternoon.
now,
the
record
will
indicate
that
the
documents
impounded
for
mayflower
were
in
the
courtroom
at
the
time.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
they
had
been
on
the
marshal's
custody,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
i
believe
that
took
him
three
days
to
examine
all
of
the
records
of
mayflower
with
the
assistance
of
an
agent,
make
the
selection
they
needed,
give
a
receipt
to
mayflower,
and
transport
the
required
documents
back
to
bismarck,
north
dakota.
those
records,
which
were
in
court,
as
i
understand
it,
occupied
one
of
these
mail
hand
trucks,
that
many
of
them
but
we're
concerned
only
with
the
first
four
items
in
specification
3.
government
counsel,
on
page
33,
was
careful
to
point
out
at
this
time
that
this
entire
contempt
proceeding
was
instituted
by
the
court
on
its
own
motion
and
not
by
the
government
filing
an
application.
when
the
proceeding
began
that
afternoon,
mr.
--
the
petitioner
took
the
stand,
examined
by
his
own
counsel
and
on
page
46
and
47
of
the
record,
it's
indicated
that
petitioner's
counsel
handed
him
exhibit
1,
which
was
the
general
ledger
of
the
mayflower
distributing
company.
the
petitioner
identified
it.
he
handed
him
exhibit
2,
which
was
the
general
ledger
for
1951
of
the
mayflower
distributing
company
and
he
identified
it.
when
he
got
to
--
to
exhibit
no.
3
and
asked
whether
he
had
examined
exhibit
no.
3,
petitioner
answered,
"yes,
sir,
i
have
examined
this
record."
now,
this
is
on
page
47.
"yes,
sir,
i
have
examined
this
record
as
well
as
the
others
and
from
my
examination
--
no,
let
me
say,
i
examined
those
two
records
--
those
other
two
records
previously
and
was
unable
to
find
any
evidence
of
slot
machines."
the
other
two
records
refer
to
exhibits
1
and
2,
the
general
ledgers
for
1950
and
1951.
the
word
previously
taken
in
the
context
involved
petitioner's
testimony
as
it
appears
on
page
48,
49,
50,
and
51
indicates
that
he
is
referring
to
april
1st,
1954.
he
examined
general
ledgers
for
1950
and
1951
prior
to
april
the
1st,
prior
to
the
return
date
on
the
subpoena.
it
is
his
failure
to
produce
these
four
items,
particular
items
of
the
general
ledgers,
the
journal
and
the
check
register
on
april
the
1st
which
he
admits
handling
that
is
the
gist
of
this
contempt
citation.
we
believe
the
record
shows
that
petitioner
acted
willfully,
both
from
his
testimony
at
the
april
1st
hearing
and
from
his
testimony
during
the
contempt
hearing.
in
a
contempt
citation
for
noncompliance
with
a
subpoena
duces
tecum,
the
burden
is
upon
the
defendant,
the
respondent
to
the
subpoena
to
establish
an
adequate
excuse
for
noncompliance.
it
must
be
a
legally
sufficient
excuse.
mere
statements
that
he
looked
and
couldn't
find
the
records
demanded
that
he
didn't
know
there
were
such
records
are
not
compelling
upon
any
court.
in
lopiparo
versus
united
states,
the
eighth
circuit
refused
to
accept
those
statements.
it
put
the
burden
squarely
upon
the
court
to
prove
the
adequacy
of
the
excuse
for
non-production.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
upon
the
person's
subpoena,
the
contemnor
to
justify
his
noncompliance.
there's
nothing
in
this
record
which
would
indicate
that
petitioner
has
established
an
adequate
legal
reason
for
noncompliance
with
subpoena
no.

mr.

it's

--

mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
that's
right
because
the
word
"previously"
when
taken
in
context
with
the
next
three
or
four
pages
indicates
that
it
was
prior
to
your
testimony
here
on

1st,
1954.
mr.
richard

if
i
gave
the
impression,
your
honor,
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
intend
to
give
that.
mr.

the
only
admission
is
to
the
general
ledgers.
mr.
richard
j.

no,
your
honor,
there's
no
admission
to
those.
the
reason
the
government
relies
upon
journal
and
check
register
is
because
they
were
introduced
into
evidence
which
establishes
their
existence.
mr.
richard
j.

at
the
offices
of
mayflower.
mr.
richard
j.

before
the

they
cover
a
fast
period
of
time,
but
there
is
no
admission
as
to
the
journal
or
the
check
register.
the
other
exhibits,
5
to

are
only
those
documents
which

brought
with
him
on
april
the

when

they
do
not
establish

against

10
months.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
yes,
your
honor.
now,
these
are
the
basic
control
books
of
the
corporation,
the
general
ledgers.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
on
the
april
1
return
date,
the
court
was
dissatisfied
with
the
return
made
and
then
issued
the
impounding
order.
the
impounding
order
was
executed
by
the
united
states
marshal
following
april
the
1st.
i
think
it
was
the
second
or
third
that
they
put
him
on.
the
petitioner
--
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
there
was
by
defendant
paster
when
he
moved
to
quash.
the
court
overruled
that.
petitioner
before
this
court
last
thursday
stated
that
there
was
no
objection
imposed
in
this
case
at
this
time
to
the
breadth
of
the
subpoena.
i
think
it's
significant
to
know
that
petitioner,
during
april
the
1st
testimony,
stated
that
he
did
not
examine
the
daily
ledger.
and
now,
we
find
him
during
a
contempt
hearing
stating
that
he
had
examined
it
previously.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
it
is
useful
to
point
out
that
the
judge
was
completely
conversant
with
all
the
facts
of
the
case,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
we'd
indicate
that
too.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
it
would
in
pointing
out
the
fact
that
peterson's
testimony
was
not
germane
to
specification
3.
it
didn't
prejudice
the
trial
court
unless
we
wouldn't
assume
that
it
would
prejudice
the
trial
court
who
had
heard
the
testimony
in
its
original
forms.
petitioner
made
an
argument
that
he
should
not
be
held
in
contempt
because
he
was
only
vice
president
and
not
familiar
with
the
accounting
principles
of
the
mayflower
distributing
company.
we
believe
that
that
answer,
that
contention
has
been
adequately
answered
by
this
court
in
the
white,
the
fleischman,
and
the
wilson
cases
in
which
it
is
held
proper
to
address
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
to
a
corporation
and
impose
a
burden
upon
the
officers
to
make
a
return
thereof.
in
this
instance,
petitioner,
however
knowledgeable
he
was
of
accounting
or
corporate
procedures,
did
submit
himself
to
the
court,
did
assume
the
responsibility
of
making
this
return.if
he
is
not
held
fully
accountable
--
accountable
for
compliance
with
this
subpoena
which
he
has
attempted
to
answer,
it
would
be
open
a
door
to
easy
evasion
to
any
subpoena.
take
the
least
informed
man
in
the
corporation
and
have
him
make
the
return,
he
also
makes
the
objection
that
there
was
not
adequate
time
given
to
him
to
prepare
his
defense.
subpoena
no.
160
was
issued
march
the
22nd
and
served
march
the
25th.
he
testifies
that
he
examined
it
shortly
after
it
was
served
upon
the
secretary,
walter
johnson,
of
the
mayflower
distributing
company.
he
conducted
a
search
for
the
documents.
walter
johnson
then
went
on
to
north
dakota
to
testify
to
be
present
on
march
the
29th
when
the
argument
was
held
upon
the
motion
to
quash
and
then
he
called
the
petitioner
to
collect
the
documents
and
bring
them
on
to
north
dakota.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
he
claims
that
he
didn't
have
adequate
opportunity
to
prepare
his
defense
to
the
specification.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
by
just
pointing
out
the
chronology
of
it,
your
honor.

richard

pardon?
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
that's
right.
mr.

the
dates
on

mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
the
show
cause
order
was
issued

23rd
and
returnable
april
27th.
now,
that
gave
him
four
days
to
prepare
his
defense.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
then
he
asked
for
further
time
to
examine
the
documents
in
the
court.
the
court
gave
him
until
3
o'clock
that
afternoon
then
they
returned.
he
renewed
his
objection
to

blanchard

in
the
morning,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
at
that
time,
he
renewed
his
objection
to
the
lack
of
time
and
the
lack
of
bill
of
particulars.
we
believe
that
he
had
adequate
time.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
it
is
represented
by
counsel,
altering
the
contempt
hearing.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
that's
right.
mr.
richard
j.

that's
correct,

honor.
they
are
the
basic

documents.
they
are
the
documents
which
he
entered
into
evidence.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
that's
right.
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
well,
in
that
point,
we
refer
to
the
supplemental
record
to
the
list
of
exhibits
on
page
51
of
the
supplemental
record.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
remains
germane.
it
was
not
objected
to
by
petitioner
in
his
motion
to
strike.
and
it's
also
of
interest
to
note
that
on
page
106
and
107
of
the
record,
the
parties,
petitioner
and
the
united
states
entered
into
a
stipulation
that
these
exhibits
would
be
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals.
and
this
is
listed
on
page
sr
51
supplemental
record
--
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
that's
right.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
those
were
the
particular
dates
they
were
concerned
with
on
the
christianson
retrial.
the
johnson
act
which
was
alleged
to
be
violated
--
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
i
believe
he
was,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
well,
they
got
this
evidence
against
him
by
virtue
of
the
impounding
order.
this
--
this
--
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
it
was
used
--
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
--
against
them,
yes.
and
then
this
is
the
procedure
that
grew
out
of
it.
it's
the
government's
position
that
the
conviction
on
specification
3
being
valid.
and
since
the
sentence
of
the
year
and
a
day
was
within
the
limits
which
this
court
--
which
the
trial
court
could
have
imposed
upon
any
one
specification
that
that
sentence
should
be
sustained
even
though
the
other
two
specifications
are
discarded.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
not
specifically,
your
honor,
but
he
had
once
--
one
--
he
had
one
general
transaction.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
we
believe,
and
of
course,
there's
no
solid
foundation
in
fact
for
it.
it's
conjecture.
the
best
you
can
do
in
this
circumstance
is
that
there
was
one
general
transaction
of
petitioner
in
relation
to
the
court,
a
general
disobedience
or
noncompliance
with
the
subpoenas.
it
was
the
general
conduct
as
set
forth
in
specification
or
captured
in
specification
3,
epitomized
in
specification
3.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
specification
3,
we
believe
this.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
that's
right.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
we
--
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
we
agree
that
the
--
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
that
the
maximum
relief
petitioner
is
entitled
to
in
this
case
would
be
a
remand
for
resentencing
--
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
--
but
not
a
retrial.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
yes
but,
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
add
on
this
point,
your
honor's
position
is
that
at
the
dicta
in
the
gompers
case
that
when
a
general
verdict
is
returned
upon
several
counts,
it
is
presumed
that
some
of
the
sentence
is
imposed
upon
each
count.
however,
position
of
this
court
in
whitfield
versus
ohio
where
a
general
sentence
was
imposed
upon
two
counts
and
the
court
questioned
the
validity
of
one
count
and
threw
it
out,
they
still
did
not
disturb
the
basic
sentence.
and
on
the
whitfield
case,
that
was
tried
to
the
court.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
that
was
whitfield
versus
ohio
involved
prison-made
goods,
prohibition
--
ohio's
prohibition
of
sale
of
prison-made
goods.
the
cases
relied
upon
petitioner
stromberg
and
williams
are
inapposite
here
because
in
that
situation,
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury
upon
two
general
theories,
one
of
which
was
valid
and
the
other,
invalid.
it
was
impossible
to
tell
from
the
general
verdict
as
distinguishing
the
general
sentence
upon
which
theory
of
the
case
the
verdict
rested.
therefore,
the
court
properly
remanded
the
case
for
retrial,
but
here,
we
have
a
valid
conviction
on
specification
3.
we
had
a
general
sentence
of
the
year
and
a
day
and
we
believe
that
it
can
be
sustained.however,
if
the
court
deems
otherwise,
we
further
contend
that
the
only
relief
petitioner
is
entitled
to
is
a
remand
for
resentencing
and
not
for
retrial
on
specification
3.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
oh
no,
no.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
well,
we
believe
that
a
year
and
a
day
is
not
an
excess
of
sentence
in
view
of
the
sentence
of
18
months
imposed
upon
mr.
lopiparo
in
the
eighth
circuit,
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
bar
and
is
held
to
a
higher
degree
of
compliance
with
the
orders
of
the
court.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
i
believe
there's
something
in
this
memorandum
opinion.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
at
some
place,
he
remarked
that
he
wasn't
sure
that
this
petitioner
would
have
faired
so
well
if
he
had
been
retried
the
second
time.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
there's
no
discretion
in
the
court,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
no
limit.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
but
we're
not
contending
as
much
here,
your
honors.
it
was
contended
on
the
appellate
court.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
well,
i
don't
think
we're
going
to
find
any
case
quite
in
point
on
this,
your
honor.
the
most
the
cases
we'll
point
out
and
the
most
i
can
cite
them
for
is
that
the
whitfield
case
doesn't
follow
the
dicta
of
gompers.
now,
it's
very
difficult,
and
i
can
--
concede
that
it's
extremely
difficult
to
second
guess
what
the
trial
judge
meant
or
what
he
had
in
mind.
did
he
intend
to
prorate
his
sentence
over
a
year
in
a
day
over
three
specifications?
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
did
he
intend
to
put
it
on
one?
we'd
like
to
think
that
the
government
contends
that
he
probably
put
it
on
one
because
it
was
one
basic
transaction.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
well
--
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
--
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
well,
that
is
one
of
the
questions
before
this
court.
i
presume,
your
honor,
it
should
be
sent
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
as
much
as
they
have
had
two
opportunities
to
rule
on
it,
they
ruled
on
it
on
the
direct
appeal
and
on
the
--
petition
for
rehearing
which
they
denied.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
no,
they
didn't.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
they
affirmed.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
they
affirmed.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
no,
they
couldn't,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
they
could
send
it
back.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
yes,
they
could,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
well,
they
could.
mr.
richard
j.
blanchard
i
see
nothing
improper,
your
honor.
