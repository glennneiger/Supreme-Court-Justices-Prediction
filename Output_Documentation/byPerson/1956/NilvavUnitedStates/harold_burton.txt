justice
harold
burton
well,
mr.
gressman,
you
were
asked
to
produce
the
--
the
record
sheets
relating
to
slot
machine.
and
on
page
51,
which
--
of
the
supplemental
record,
records
indicate
that
sales,
sales
of
new
slot
machines
may
dispose.
well,
that
means
to
me
that
--
that
you
were
asked
to
produce
those
particular
records
showing
those
sales
of
slot
machines,
do
i
read
that
properly?
justice
harold
burton
there
--
there
was
proof
--
isn't
that
proof
--
whether
it's
correct
proof
or
not,
but
isn't
that
proof
that
they
were
records
of
february
1950
relating
to
slot
machines
on
your
ledger?
justice
harold
burton
that
may
be
--
justice
harold
burton
--
but
the
judge
would
have
a
right
to
--
to
appraise
the
evidence
as
between
one
who
will
testify
that
they
were
records
and
this
man
who
testified
that
there
weren't
any
records,
did
he
not?
justice
harold
burton
let's
assume
that
this
was
a
testimony
before
the
judge
on
1951?
justice
harold
burton
well,
some
list
of
exhibits.
i
--
i
don't
know.
i
maybe
thinking
of
it
improperly
or
wrongly,
but
it
looks
to
me
like
you
have
definite
proof
before
the
judge.
the
proof
may
be
right
or
wrong
that
there
were
slot
machine
records
called
for
by
your
no.
160
subpoena.
justice
harold
burton
and
--
well,
that's
the
record
of
february
of
1950
or
maybe
not.
justice
harold
burton
well,
if
the
first
one
is
february,
the
next
one
is
october
and
the
next
is
december.
the
date
is
july
1950
to
april
1951.
justice
harold
burton
mr.
gressman,
i
just
want
to
make
sure
of
your
answer
to
justice
harlan.
you
said
after
these
books
were
presented
to
the
court
and
the
fbi
men
testified
about
them,
didn't
it
appear
that
some
of
these
records
did
relate
to
used
slot
machine?
was
--
wasn't
that
clear
in
the
testimony
there
were
some
interest
in
them?
justice
harold
burton
yes.
justice
harold
burton
they
were
in
these
books
though,
weren't
they?
justice
harold
burton
but
he
did
find
a
substantial
number
of
used
sales,
sales
of
used
machines.
