mr.
eugene
gressman
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
would
just
like
to
add
a
few
comments
to
what
i
had
in
my
remarks
last
thursday.
it
seems
that
the
government
has
now
retreated
even
further
from
the
position
it
took
in
its
briefs
and
has
orally
announced
that
it
no
longer
seeks
to
support
any
part
of
the
third
specification,
except
as
to
the
two
or
possibly
four.
i
wasn't
exactly
clear
with
the
number
of
items,
the
first
--
few
items
in
specification
no.
3,
thereby
abandoning
some
18
or
more
of
the
items
which
are
set
forth
in
specification
no.
3.
considering
that
there
was
no
adequate
proof
apparently
that
--
that
those
items
were
in
existence.
now,
i
would
also
add
one
other
item.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
right.
now,
i
would
also
point
out
to
your
honors
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes,
i
do
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--
your
honor.
that
seems
to
me
to
mean
and
it's
not
entirely
clear
since
this
was
a
statement
of
his
which
was
interrupted
by
the
court.
it
was
not
completed
and
we
will
never
know
from
this
record
what
he
actually
meant
there,
but
it
is
my
reading
of
that
and
my
understanding
that
he
was
referring
to
the
fact
that
he
had
examined
those
two
records
during
the
time
allowed
him
that
same
day,
previously
which
was
between
the
hours
of
10
and
3
o'clock.
that
was
--
that
was
the
first
time
he'd
ever
seen
those
records
as
far
as
this
record
indicates.
mr.
eugene
gressman
those
were
slot
machines
and
that
brings
up
the
point,
your
honor,
that
i
emphasize
last
thursday
and
that
is
that
it's
not
enough
to
show
that
these
two
or
three
items
were
actually
in
existence.
and
in
the
courtroom,
it
was
also
essential
to
show
that
there
was
a
relationship
between
the
contents
of
those
records
and
what
was
called
for
by
the
--
the
rather
broad
and
encompassing
nature
of
the
subpoena
no.
160,
and
by
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
now,
you
--
again,
he's
referring
to
the
supplemental
record
and
while
i
don't
think
that
any
admission
or
a
failure
to
object
to
a
particular
portion
give
--
adds
to
the
power
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
consider
or
add
to
something
which
is
not
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes,
your
honor.
now,
on
that
point
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
i'm
not
clear
about
that,
your
honor,
if
--
if
it
is
true,
it
must
be
in
the
record
but
i'm
not
--
at
the
moment,
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
fact.
but
at
least,
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
that
these
list
of
exhibits
in
page
51
of
the
supplemental
record,
if
taken
as
true
or
stipulated
to,
does
not
confirm
the
fact
that
the
items
mentioned
in
those
ledgers
were
what
--
were
relevant
under
subpoena
no.
160.
now,
you
have
these
conflicting
statements
by
the
defendant
himself
during
the
testimony
that
they
did
not
name
any
evidence
of
slot
machines.
and
so,
if
--
if
you
have
--
it
seems
to
me
a
clear
conflict
there
between
his
statements
and
this
itemization
in
the
listing
and
that
--
that
clearly
put
into
issue
this
very
question
of
the
relevance
of
these
exhibits,
of
these
two
or
three
exhibits
to
subpoena
no.
160.
and
if
you're
going
to
refer
to
the
basic
standard
of
proof
in
these
cases,
namely,
that
you
prove
guilt
beyond
all
reasonable
doubt,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
cannot
affirm
a
conviction
which
is
based
upon
such
a
conflicting
testimony
on
the
basic
question
of
contempt.
and
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
no,
i
say
that
if
they
are
--
if
--
if
they
are
in
the
record
and
that
an
issue
is
raised
as
to
their
relevance,
it's
incumbent
upon
the
government
to
prove
that
they
are
what
it
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
in
the
contempt
proceeding,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
gressman
because
the
contempt
proceeding
has
to
stand
alone
by
itself.
mr.
eugene
gressman
when
you
have
a
--
a
general
subpoena,
your
honor.
now,
i'm
not
saying
it's
unduly
vague
and
broad,
but
when
you
have
a
general
subpoena
calling
for
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
calling
without
specifying
the
particular
items
which
are
called
for
as
later
specified
in
the
order
to
show
cost,
but
when
you
have
a
--
a
subpoena
which
calls
not
for
all
the
records
of
the
corporation,
not
for
any
particular
record
but
for
certain
categories
of
records.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
you'll
find
those
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
categories
which
would
indicate
the
sales
of
slot
machines,
coin
operated
devices
whether
new
or
used
between
certain
specified
dates.
now,
this
corporation
did
--
does
business
other
than
with
relation
to
those
particular
items
that
had
for
example
a
--
a
lot
of
--
of
business
connected
with
the
servicing
of
slot
machines
or
coin
operated
devices
rather
than
sales
or
purchases.
so
that
--
they're
not
now
calling
for
all
the
records
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
right.
mr.
eugene
gressman
between
certain
specified
dates.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
right,
your
honor,
particularly
where
he
brings
that
into
issue
in
his
testimony.
mr.
eugene
gressman
they
asked
for
certain
books
of
account
relating
to
slot
machines.
now
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--
that
may
or
may
not
include
all
the
--
the
books
of
account
it
has.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
right.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
no,
your
honor,
there
--
there
--
it's
conceivable
that
there
are
bookkeeping
records,
ledger
sheets,
invoices
or
whatnot
which
do
not
reflect
purchases
and
sales
of
slot
machines
or
coin
operated
devices.
they
did
other
business
than
--
than
slot
--
sale
and
purchases
of
slot
machines
and
coin
operated
devices.
and
some
of
their
bookkeeping
records
may
very
well
not
have
reflected
any
of
the
--
the
subject
matter
with
which
this
subpoena
is
concerned.
mr.
eugene
gressman
to
the
best
of
my
ability,
yes.
yes,
he
said
that
i
am
responding
and
trying
to
bring
in
everything
that
i
don't
have
an
accounting
experience,
i'm
not
too
familiar
with
all
of
these
bookkeeping
records,
ledger
sheets
and
so
forth,
but
i
--
i
have
attempted
to
comply.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
that's
another
way
of
saying.
i
think
the
same
thing
that
he
--
he
was
not
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--
he
was
not
asked
to
produce
the
--
the
general
ledger
for
1950
to
1951
as
such.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
as
i
understand
this
list
of
exhibits,
they
refer
only
to
the
exhibits
which
were
introduced
through
the
petitioner.
now,
they
don't
have
any
relation
to
the
--
direct
relationship
to
the
subpoena.
i
mean
these
were
--
what
were
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
now,
you
have
this
testimony
of
his
that
--
that
there
was
no
such
evidence
in
that.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
assuming
that
--
that
these
were
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
presumably,
your
honor.
now,
that
--
that's
not
absolutely
clear
that
--
that
these
items
were
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
your
honor,
it
--
it's
--
it
seems
to
me
rather
difficult
to
say
that
--
that
they
were
specifically
the
ones
that
were
called
for
by
the
subpoena
without
some
further
elaboration
or
proof
of
them.
mr.
eugene
gressman
no.
that's
before
july
1,
1950
when
the
--
the
subpoena
calls
for
it.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
it
appears
on
page
106
of
the
first
record.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes.
well,
now,
your
honor,
of
course
it's
--
it's
still
a
question
as
to
what
is
meant
by
slot
machines.
i
mean,
that's
a
--
not
a
term
of
art
particularly.
it's
--
it's
a
generic
term
which
may
require
some
elaborations
as
to
what
is
meant
by
that
in
relation
to
whether
the
--
the
matters
in
this
exhibit
were
really
slot
machines
or
exactly
what
they
were.
i
think
it's
--
the
matter
was
put
into
issue
by
the
defendant
and
i
think
it
requires
elaboration
and
it
points
up
what
i
think
is
the
basic
issue
in
this
case
and
that
is
the
reliance
on
the
knowledge
of
judge
vogel
in
--
as
a
substitute
for
proof
of
contempt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
you
have
not
only
this,
but
you
have
an
entire
absence
in
this
record
of
the
order
of
march
29
issued
by
judge
vogel,
which
is
also
one
of
the
basic
elements
of
this
third
specification
which
never
appears
in
the
record.
i
have
searched
from
beginning
to
end
of
both
the
supplemental
and
the
regular
record,
and
i
have
never
found
any
identification
or
indication
of
what
that
march
29
order
reads
or
provides.
and
yet,
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
upon
which
this
petitioner
was
found
guilty
of
contempt
under
the
third
specification.
and
that
this
is
entire
general
approach
to
the
case
which
i
believe
requires
condemnation,
this
reliance
upon
the
judge's
knowledge
of
the
case
rather
than
insisting.
mr.
eugene
gressman
pardon?
mr.
eugene
gressman
presumably,
during
the
course
of
the
criminal
trial
and
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
right.
he
was
not
a
defendant.
he
was
not
present.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
right.
and
i
think
he
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
knowledge,
i'm
not
sure.
i
don't
mean
by
christianson.
you
mean
that
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
peterson.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes.
knowledge
not
only
as
to
peterson's
--
knowledge
gained
through
peterson's
testimony
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
right,
but
it's
knowledge
about
these
--
these
particular
items
that
he
may
have
acquired
during
the
course
of
the
previous
trial
or
during
the
--
which
knowledge
was
not
thrust
upon
the
defendant
in
the
nature
of
proper
testimony
or
evidence
so
that
he
could
refute
or
rebut
or
examine
as
he
saw
fit
and
to
take
these
particular
items
to
--
so
he
could
know
what
the
government's
contention
or
the
court's
contention
was
as
to
their
existence
or
more
particularly
as
to
their
relevance
under
the
--
under
the
case,
under
the
subpoena.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
your
honor,
it
was
a
very
broad
--
a
very
exhaustive
specification
to
begin
with.
and
there
were
thousands
of
documents
to
be
examined
and
to
relate
to
--
to
attempt
to
relate
to
the
subpoena
and
more
particularly
the
ones
in
the
specifications.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
upon
such
short
notice
and
i
deny
the
government's
contention
that
he
had
from
april
1
to
prepare
for
this
case.
it
wasn't
until
april
23rd
that
he
knew
for
the
first
time
what
the
specifications
of
contempt
that
the
judge
was
citing
him
for,
and
he
had
only
that
short
weekend
within
a
new
attorney
coming
in
on
the
case.
he
never
had
a
fulltime
attorney
previously
to
that
to
familiarize
himself
with
this
case.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
entirely
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
it's
entirely
possible,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
think
that's
the
key
to
this
whole
case,
your
honor,
is
the
failure
--
not
so
much
perhaps
of
the
government
but
of
the
trial
judge
since
he
initiated
this
contempt
proceeding
to
take
steps
to
see
that
all
the
basic
elements
of
contempt
were
presented
at
the
trial
and
that
the
petitioner
was
there
confronted
with
the
evidence
and
given
a
chance
to
explain
our
rebut
at
that
point,
rather
than
relying
upon
the
supplemental
records
and
all
the
other
errors
that
i
think
the
government
has
conceded
in
this
case
which
the
trial
judge
used
to
sustain
the
conviction.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
say,
your
honor,
there's
no
--
there's
no
proof
in
this
record
that
there
--
the
--
there
was
an
identity
between
what
was
introduced
at
the
christianson
case
and
what
he
failed
to
produce
here,
no.
that
is
--
now,
even
that
is
not
clear,
your
honor.
the
record
is
quite
muddy
on
that
and
the
petitioner's
counsel
in
the
record
below
indicates
that
he
never
had
time
to
examine.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
i
say
more
than
that
but
he
never
had
time
to
--
there
--
nobody
took
time
to
identify
them
or
find
out
if
they
were
in
existence
and
what
their
relevance
was.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
--
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
and
--
well,
that
assumes
of
course
that
he
had
proper
time
to
examine
those.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes,
but
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
gressman
it
takes
more
than
--
than
a
--
an
outline
of
what
is
in
that
exhibit
to
identify
it
with
the
subpoena
as
within
the
scope
of
the
subpoena,
particularly
where
he
raises
that
issue
himself
and
denies
that
it
has
any
relationship
to
that
subpoena.
it
seems
to
me
it's
incumbent
on
someone,
the
judge
or
the
--
the
government
prosecutor
to
confront
him
with
the
evidence
of
that
relationship
so
that
he
can
adequately
defend
himself
on
that
issue.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
they
could
not
have
rested
on
anything
more
than
that.
i
mean
there
was
not
--
there's
nothing
in
there
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
no,
just
the
records
themselves
apparently.
mr.
eugene
gressman
and
that
they
were
introduced
by
the
petitioner
rather
than
by
the
government.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
my
understanding,
yes.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
as
i
understand
it
they
also
--
within
the
terminology
coin
operated
devices
also
sell
such
things
as
cigarette
dispensing
machines,
soft
drink,
coffee
dispensers
and
the
like.
mr.
eugene
gressman
oh,
yes,
your
honor,
they're
not
confined
to
the
--
the
ordinary
slot
machine
or
the
one-armed
bandit
type
of
thing,
it's
all
these
in
which
you
insert
a
coin
into
the
machine
and
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--
for
one
purpose
or
another.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes,
sir.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
am
afraid
i'm
not
that
familiar
with
it
to
know.
mr.
eugene
gressman
they
have
apparently,
half
dozen
office
employees
which
i
think
was
indicated
somewhere
in
this
record.
mr.
eugene
gressman
not
to
--
to
one
who
was
familiar
with
the
--
the
records
you
mean?
mr.
eugene
gressman
possibly
not
to
one
who
is
familiar
and
who
is
with
the
records
and
who
has
accounting
and
bookkeeping
experience,
no,
which
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
it
--
it's
possible
that
it
was
difficult
particularly
to
this
petitioner
as
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
when
the
government
agent
ceased
the
entire
records
in
the
impounding
orders,
they
ceased
literally
thousands
upon
thousands.
we
took
a
whole
truck
full
of
records
out
of
there,
and
i
don't
know
whether
that
reflects
upon
the
--
the
competency
of
their
filing
system,
but
there
were
literally
tens
of
thousands
of
various
ledgers,
bookkeeping
items,
files
and
the
like
which
required
a
--
a
corp
of
f.b.i.
agents
and
accountants
to
go
through.
it
took
them
three
or
four
days
to
go
through.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
presumably
not
the
one
who
is
familiar
and
who
is
the
custodian
of
those
records
and
the
record
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
only
as
a
last
measure
because
everybody
else
in
official
status
there
was
tied
up
with
the
trial,
which
was
beginning
on
--
practically
on
the
return
date
of
this
subpoena
and
the
secretary
of
treasure
was
out
on
that
business.
the
president
was
away
from
there
and
this
petitioner
who
did
nothing
but
legal
business
for
the
corporation
was
called
in
at
the
last
minute
on
the
phone
and
asked,
“would
you
please
try
to
make
a
return
on
this
subpoena?”
and
despite
the
fact
that
he
had
no
knowledge
of
the
records
and
had
no
business
or
accounting
experience,
he
did
make
what
is
an
unchallenged
good
faith
effort
to
go
through
these
thousands
of
records.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
all
in
--
and
explained
in
the
testimony.
mr.
eugene
gressman
we
--
we
claimed
and
it's
set
forth
at
length
in
our
brief,
your
honor,
that
under
these
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
don't
think
the
claim
was
made
at
that
point,
your
honor,
no.
but
we
claim
that
under
this
unique
circumstances
that
a
good
faith
effort
on
the
part
of
one
who
is
not
officially
responsible
for
the
records,
which
is
the
terminology
used
in
the
wilson
case
that
that
is
an
adequate
excuse
for
failure
to
produce
records
and
unless
--
if
there
is
some
proof
of
bad
faith
on
his
part
that
he
should
not
be
held
in
contempt
for
failing
to
produce
particular
items
as
to
which
he
made
a
good
faith
effort
to
find.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
i
wouldn't
say
there's
no
way
of
enforcing
it,
your
honor.
they
did
secure
through
the
impounding
order
but
more
directly
to
your
question
under
the
unique
circumstances
of
this
case
were
here,
all
the
responsible
officers
were
tied
up
by
the
pendency
of
this
criminal
trial
and
where
this
individual
who
is
described
by
the
trial
judge
himself
as
merely
a
nominal
officer,
a
nominal
vice
president
of
this
company
whose
duties
were
so
illegal
in
nature,
where
he
voluntary
attempts
to
comply.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
should
not
hold
him
to
the
high
uncompromising
standard
that
a
responsible
officer,
let's
say
the
president
or
the
secretary
of
treasure
would
have
in
responding
to
that,
that
you
will
recognize
a
good
faith
effort
in
this
--
on
this
petitioner's
part
where
you
might
not
say
that
was
enough
on
the
part
of
a
person
who
is
primarily
responsible
for
the
--
for
those
records
and
the
keeping
of
those
records.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
your
honor,
that
raises
the
question
as
to
how
much
of
a
lawyer
he
was.
he
was
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
not
--
certainty,
he
was
not
a
lawyer
in
relation
to
this
criminal
case.
mr.
eugene
gressman
and
it's
also
--
it
--
it
seems
to
me
impossible
as
far
the
sentence
is
concerned
to
--
and
the
fact
that
he
was
a
lawyer
to
dissociate
the
fact
that
what
really
concerned
the
trial
judge
apparently
and
what
obviously
concerned
the
court
of
appeals
was
the
first
specification.
mr.
eugene
gressman
on
--
and
i
think
that's
reflected
in
the
sentencing
and
--
and
i
think
that
the
fact
that
he
was
a
lawyer,
he's
probably
primary
in
that.
mr.
eugene
gressman
and
the
fact
that
he
was
a
lawyer,
i
don't
think
distinguishes
him
here
though
insofar
as
his
obedience
or
his
attempt
to
make
the
good
faith
search.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
right.
mr.
eugene
gressman
the
same
time
the
government
had
one
attempt,
one
chance
to
find
out
what
these
records
were
and
what
were
necessary
to
the
trial,
the
second
trial.
and
yet,
we
come
along
the
second
trial
and
they
have
yet
--
they're
unable
to
specify
exactly
what
they
want
and
they
engaged
in
this
sort
of
a
fishing
expedition
to
bring
in
all
these
categories
without
specifying
at
that
point
what
it
is
they
need
for
this
second
trial.
it
seems
to
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
think
that's
a
fair
conclusion.
mr.
eugene
gressman
of
the
fbi
agents
you
mean?
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
it's
quite
true,
your
honor,
but
there
is
no
evidence
that
what
the
basis
of
what
that
fbi
agent
was
stating
were
the
items
which
were
specified
in
this
order
to
show
cause
in
the
third
specification
particular.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
we
don't
know.
he
didn't
set
forth
in
his
testimony
what
was
the
basis.
he
was
testifying
from
general
summaries
he
had
made
from
this
entire
mass
of
documents
and
without
specifying
what
particular
items
he
based
his
conclusions
on
as
to
slot
machines
and
other
items.
mr.
eugene
gressman
from
some
unidentified
source,
your
honor,
yes,
as
far
as
this
record
shows.
i
--
i
assume
--
i
--
of
course,
there
are
other
--
some
other
matters
in
my
briefs
which
i
know
your
honors
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--
will
read
and
consider
this
case.
