justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mind
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mind,
mr.
blanchard
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
before
you
get
to
the
negative
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
--
that
doesn't
flow
into
3.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
with
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
seems
to
be
the
same.
i'm
not
arguing
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
can
we
know?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
by
(inaudible)
to
the
judge,
the
highest
relevance,
as
i
suppose,
(inaudible)
to
judge,
isn't
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
an
objection
to
the
breadth
of
the
subpoena?
is
there
objection
to
the
breadth
of
the
subpoena?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
isn't
that
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
relevant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
--
what
is
the
objection
as
to
inadequacy
of
opportunity
to
do
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
so
understood
you
when
you
started
out
but
then
you
went
over
to
the
evidence.
what's
the
evidence
on
that?
i
don't
see
the
bearing
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
subpoena
was
relevant
to
that
matter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
--
the
opportunity
of
--
of
producing
what
he
was
asked
to
produce
isn't
relevant
to
that
company.
if
i
understand
it,
the
objection
is
he
didn't
have
time
to
respond
to
these
specifications,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
are
the
--
what
are
the
dates?
what
is
the
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
he
--
what
did
he
do
on
april
23rd?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
10
in
the
morning.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
of
these
represented
by
counsel?
justice
felix
frankfurter
since
he
can't
tell,
that
would
have
been
reviewed
and
taken.
the
appropriateness
of
the
sentence
by
the
--
by
the
district
judge
had
the
only
one
specification
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
generally.
anyway,
he
--
there's
no
basis
for
making
any
judgment
as
to
what
judge
vogel
(inaudible)
would
have
thought
was
a
mete
punishment
if
only
specification
3
or
if
one
which
he
had
formulated
and
charged.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
isn't
what
contempt
proceedings
that
were
avowed
a
general
transaction
as
to
be
specific
if
you
will
recognize
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
one
we
call
for
and
he
made
3
and
2
are
not
sustainable
on
the
government's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
appropriate
recognition
here.
so,
when
you
say,
"you've
got
to
do
the
best
you
can,‚Äù
i
suggest
one
better
way
to
do
that
is
to
go
back
and
have
justice
vogel
decide
what
he
would
have
done
on
--
what
he
would
do
on
reflection
to
those
specifications
are.
i
think
that's
better.
justice
felix
frankfurter
guess
what
he
would
do
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
what
--
what
he
could
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
a
different
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
were
not
up
to
this
point
or
what
to
do
with
the
sentence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
a
state
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
this
minute,
may
i
ask
what
the
chief
justice
is
saying?
not
only
combined
but
is
separate,
suppose
he
did
deem
his
one
transaction,
it's
not
too
difficult
to
assume
that
a
judgment
be
more
painless,
more
deserving
of
punishment
pertinently
rather
than
withholding
documents.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
there's
not
--
obeying
a
subpoena
is
commendable
or
isn't
(inaudible)
thing,
but
i
do
suggest
that
the
generality
of
(inaudible)
much
more
likely
to
impose
to
produce
the
documents.
they
would
think
that
isn't
anything
like
that,
it's
going
out
on
this
stand
and
falsely
swearing.
(inaudible)
a
part
from
congress,
he
may
have
thought
the
year
was
a
good
thing
for
specification
1
and
when
he
came
to
specification
3,
questionable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
vacate
the
sentence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
could
change
the
sentence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
if
the
sentence
has
to
be
adjusted
and
measured
in
this
case
and
it
has
to
be
by
the
district
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
before
you
move
on?
i
can
see
no
legal
difficulty
involved.
i'm
not
talking
about
this
one.
i
can
see
no
legal
difficulty
in
sustaining
a
specification
which
lists
10
or
12
items,
12
items
that
can
make
proof
of
only
three
of
the
12.
i
see
no
difficulty
in
concluding
that
there
was
less
specification
sustained.
in
other
words,
the
government
must
have
sustained
every
subdivision
in
specification
3
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
sustained
the
specification.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
quite
follow.
i
must
have
misunderstand
what
you're
saying.
assume
--
assume
the
documents
(inaudible)
and
they're
not
produced
--
will
or
not
produced,
must
you
go
beyond
that
and
show
that
if
they
had
been
produced,
they
would
have
revealed
evidence
relevant
to
the
main
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
contempt
proceeding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
why.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right,
and
i
should
think
that
you
don't
try
out
there
the
relevance
of
documents
asked
to
be
produced
in
the
main
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
what
that
means,
general
subpoena.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
--
did
the
government
characterized
the
papers
they
wanted
as
papers
related
to
slot
machines
or
did
the
government
asked
for
certain
books
of
account
within
a
certain
date,
which
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
did
he
object
to
it?
did
he
respond
to
this
subpoena
and
--
as
--
in
effect
say,
"i'm
producing
everything
that
comes
within
the
scope
of
the
subpoena,
so
here
it
is?"
justice
felix
frankfurter
then,
why
don't
you
attack
your
argument
just
what
it
is?
why
don't
you
say
we're
never
asked
to
produce
the
general
ledger
of
the
1950?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
different
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
saying
is
he
didn't
disobey
it,
not
that
it
wasn't
proven
relevant.
if
you
say
he
didn't
disobey
it
because
he
was
never
asked
to
produce
it,
i
can
understand
that.
if
the
record
bears
it
out,
i
can
understand
that.
that's
a
very
simple
position.
that's
the
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
knowledge,
you
mean
christianson
--
whatever
christianson's
testimony?
i
thought
that's
what
you
mean
by
knowledge
out
there
for
this
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
f.b.i.
agent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
peterson.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
government
disavowed
that
completely.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
that.
the
subpoena
gave
them
the
scope
of
the
area
within
which
he
was
asked
to
produce
things.
the
specification
gives
him
bill
of
particulars
as
to
the
failure
to
produce,
either
than
that,
give
him
more
of
a
notice
and
all
of
these
connections
that
he
wants
to
which
the
director's
testimony.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
documents
that
informed
the
mind
of
the
judge
in
the
christianson
trial
were
also
documents
in
this
case,
but
you
said
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
isn't
good
enough
because
you
didn't
have
a
time
to
examine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
difference.
that's
--
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that's
--
your
real
contention
is,
i
should
think
it
might
be
muddy
but
it's
clear
enough
to
justify
the
(inaudible)
all
those
documents
were
again
in
contempt
and
you
said
they
were,
but
you
say
you
didn't
have
time
to
examine
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
the
documents
that
were
in
the
criminal
trial
are
also
in
evidence
in
the
contempt
proceeding
and
if
it
isn't
and
if
the
defendant
in
contempt
proceeding
wasn't
precluded
from
having
knowledge
or
examined
those
documents
and
they
are
in
them
and
they
are
in
the
contempt
proceeding,
that
it
isn't
(inaudible)
not
merely
the
abstraction
that
he
didn't
have
any
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
it
turns
on
(a)
what
documentation
there
was
in
the
contempt
record
and
(b)
whether
that
documentation
can
reasonably
be
brought
home
for
this
defendant
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
certainly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
take
into
account
the
totality
of
the
situation
that
this
was
a
lawyer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
can
we
decide
that
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
he
at
one
--
the
record
shows
that
he
said
he's
a
good
enough
lawyer,
not
to
need
any
lawyer
to
defend
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
with
you
on
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
with
you
on
the
sentencing
part.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
bears
on
all
these
things
of
what
he
knows,
what's
its
citation
and
whether
he
has
time
and
all
of
the
business
that
makes
difference
between
a
lawyer
and
a
layman
who
comes
into
court
even
he's
very
bright
and
distinguished,
he
had
to
be
(inaudible)
by
court
proceedings.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then,
we
have
to
find
out
what
kind
of
a
lawyer
he
was
on
both
sides.
