brennan,

where
are
you
reading
this
at?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me,
mr.
blanchard.
do
you
suggest
that
we
need
to
be
concerned
only
with
a,
b,
c,
and
d?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
we
may
forget
the
rest
of
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
--
the
government
rests
its
case
on
the
third
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
respect
to
the
labor
act.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
had
they
been
meanwhile,
mr.
blanchard?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
had
he
--
had
he
taken
them
on
the
day
they
were
impounded
from
the
office?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
tell
me
again,
mr.
blanchard,
where
you
say
it
is
that
we'll
find
his
admission
that
before
the
return
day
of
the
subpoena,
he
handled
items
a
to
d
closely?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
line?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
the
one,
"no,
let
me
say
i
examined
these
other
two
records?"
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
previously.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
suggest
that
that
means
exhibits
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it's
the
general
ledger
for
1950
and
the
general
ledger
for
1951.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
they
--
that
this
means
that
he
admits
he
examined
it
before
the
return
day
of
the
subpoena.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
where
is
it
you
say
there's
an
admission
by
him
that
he
examined
the
journal
and
checklist
before
the
return
dates?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
the
only
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there's
nowhere
out
--
no
admission
at
all
as
to
the
general
or
check
register?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
their
existence
you
mean
at
the
offices
of
mayflower.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
the
return
date
of
the
subpoena.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
your
point
is,
mr.
blanchard,
that
between
10
and
3,
among
other
things
he
examined
were
these
items
a,
b,
c,
and
d.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
he
should,
from
an
examination
of
them,
have
been
able
to
recollect
whether
in
fact
they
were
among
the
things
he
examined
before
april
1st,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
we
came
back
at
3,
your
point
is
that
in
effect
he
admitted
in
the
testimony
you
referred
to
me
too
earlier,
that
he
had
before
april
1st
examined
at
least
a
and
d
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
is
it
further
somewhere
in
the
--
is
it
further
somewhere
in
this
evidence,
some
connection
between
certain
sheets
in
those
general
ledgers
and
the
dates
that
the
subpoena
referred
to,
whenever
they
were
as
to
sales
of
used
machine?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
this
is
--
this
is
the
part
of
the
supplemental
record
that
you
say
remains
germane
to
the
certain
specification.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
looking
at
51,
i
gather
those
a,
b,
and
cs,
(inaudible)
sales,
paster
and
mayflower,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
those
are
the
particular
dates
that
we're
concerned
with
or
they
were
concerned
with
at
the
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
was
christianson
convicted
at
any
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
without
the
benefit
of
at
least
this
evidence,
was
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
used
at
any
event.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
against.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
won't
admit
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
this
entitle
at
least
that
much.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
will
not
admit
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
government
will
not
admit
to
this
entitle
at
least
that
much.
in
other
words,
to
go
back
to
the
trial
judge
and
resentence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me,
mr.
gressman
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
before
you
leave
that,
at
47,
have
you
any
comment
on
the
sufficiency
of
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
mr.
blanchard
referred
us
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
which
is
sufficient?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
he
was
saying
here
was
that
in
fact
after
examining
him
on
that
very
day,
he
found
in
them
no
reference
to
any
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
what
is
the
significance
then
of
what
mr
.blanchard
referred
us
to
at
page
51
of
these
lists
of
exhibit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
on
the
premise
--
on
the
premise
that
there
was
no
--
nothing
irregular
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
about
the
court
of
appeals
looking
at
it.
as
i
understood
mr.
blanchard,
there
was
some
stipulation
before
the
court
of
appeals
that
in
fact
the
ledgers
of
1950
and
1951
contain
these
references
or
at
least
the
ledger
of
1950
to
sales
of
used
slot
machines.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
that
the
fact?
was
that
stipulated
on
behalf
of
the
defendant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
gressman,
is
it
a
little
more
definite
than
that?
that's
at
page
24.
is
this
the
subpoena?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
that
includes,
for
example,
eliminating
the
immaterial
or
irrelevant
types
of
papers,
ledger
sheets
entered
in
july
1,
1950
through
april
30,
1951
reflecting
any
and
all
purchases
and
sales
of
all
slot
machines,
flat-top
or
console,
coin-operated
device,
whether
new
or
used
with
any
persons
as
far
as
we're
concerned.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
rather
more
specific,
isn't
it,
than
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
any
speculation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
is
this
stipulation
in
the
record,
mr.
gressman,
that
deals
with
that
1951
matter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
gressman,
may
i
ask
you
this?
are
you
suggesting
something
like
this
that
the
judge
knew
because
he
presided
at
the
second
christianson
trial?
that
after
the
subpoena
did
not
produce
certain
documents,
when
the
--
all
documents
were
impounded,
documents
were
found
among
mayflowers
records
which
where
in
fact
used
by
the
government
in
its
case
against
christianson
and
that
from
that
fact,
the
judge
may
well
have
concluded
that
there
had
been
a
disobedience
of
the
subpoena
because
the
records
did
exist
because
he
had
seen
them.
they
were
produced
to
trial
against
christianson.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
what
you're
getting
at?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
he
--
he
reached
this
conclusion
of
disobedience
from
his
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
the
records
existed
and
not
from
any
other,
or
at
least
not
based
solely
upon
the
evidence
which
was
offered
against
nilva
at
the
trial
for
contempt,
is
that
it?
