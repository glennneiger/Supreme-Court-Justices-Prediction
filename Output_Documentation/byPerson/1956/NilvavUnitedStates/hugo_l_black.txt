what
category
here
in
connection
with
--
as
related
to
your
argument
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you?
is
it
clear
that
they
can
get
just
what
you
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
before
you
move
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying
there
that
they
asked
for
certain
papers
relating
to
slot
machines
for
answers?
they
didn't
tell
you
what
the
papers
were
--
justice
hugo
l.

--
and
all
papers
relating
to
slot
machine.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
is
it
your
argument
that
it's
the
duty
of
the
government
to
show
that
he
had
paid
for
this
plus
the
fact
that
they're
related
to
slot
machines?

in
which
this

for

justice

what
you're
claiming
--
what
you're
claiming
there
is,
as
i
understand
it,
that
it
was
impossible
of
the
evidence
of
printed
record
to
show
that
there
was
any
failure
to
produce
the
particular
documents
you
have
called
for.
and
that
the
government
is
attempting
to
rely
on
knowledge
that
the
judge
has
in
other
--
in
another
trial
without
offering
the
evidence
anew
where
the
defendant
could
cross-examine.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
what
you
saying
now,
i
want
to
see
if
i
get
it
clearly.
you're
saying
that
if
you
assume
that
there
was
enough
evidence
in
the
criminal
case
to
identify
documents
for
being
the
kind
accorded
(inaudible)
and
being
the
kind
that
the
defendant
knew
about
and
failed
to
produce
even
if
there
was
such
evidence
in
the
criminal
trial,
there
was
no
evidence
and
so
forth
to
prove
that
in
the
contempt
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
if
defendant
in
contempt
case
was
entitled
to
have
evidence
offered
where
he
could
refuse
and
could
cross-examine
the
witnesses
be
confronted
with
them
in
his
contempt.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
assumes
another
thing,
doesn't
it?
as
i
understand
your
contention,
maybe
it's
wrong,
but
you
say
that
the
documents
themselves
although
offered
in
the
contempt
were
not
enough
in
themselves
to
show
their
identity.
