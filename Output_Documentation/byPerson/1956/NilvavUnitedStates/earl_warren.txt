number

allen
i.
nilva,
petitioner,
versus
united
states
of
america.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
blanchard,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
he
actually
have
--
he
actually
had
from
the
25th
until
the
--
25th
of
march
until
the
second
of
april
to
make
you
search,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
april
1st.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
government
counsel
brought
petitioner
and
his
counsel
to
the
court's
chambers
pointed
out
the
subpoena
had
been
served
and
said,
“now,
this
morning,
they
come
in
with
only
the
records
of
new
machines.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
was
on
what
date?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
return
date
--
the
thing
that's
confusing
in
a
list
that
the
return
date
was
the
29th,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
blanchard,
did
you
give
any
thought
to
the
question
whether
if
this
case
goes
back,
it
should
go
back
to
the
district
court
or
should
go
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
light
of
all
of
these
concessions
that
you
--
that
you
make
as
to
count
one
and
count
two
and
--
and
it
seems
to
me
that
in
this
case,
isn't
there
also
the
--
the
question
of
whether
the
trial
court
used
the
correct
rule
of
criminal
procedure?
and
did
you
give
any
thought
to
whether
it
would
be
appropriate
if
we
we're
going
to
send
it
back
--
to
send
it
back
to
--
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
clean
up
this
whole
thing
and
send
it
--
send
it
up
here
if
necessary
on
--
on
the
précising
that
you
do
contend
because
apparently
you
contended
one
thing
in
the
appellate
court
and
you're
contending
entirely
different
thing
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you're
not
and
i
should
say
you're
not.
you're
--
what
you're
asking
for
exactly
the
same
result
and
you
don't
appear
to
have
any
cases
exactly
in
point
as
the
whitfield
case
and
there
the
--
the
nearest
thing
you
have
in
point
on
--
on
this
question
of
whether
a
man
can
be
where
there's
one
count
and
--
there
are
three
counts
and
the
judge
gives
him
one
--
one
year
on
--
on
all
counts
combined
that
if
the
government
waives
two
--
two
of
the
counts
that
we
should
still
assume
that
--
that
one
year
is
adequate
or
is
proper.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
not
might
and
not
be
entirely
different
in
the
eyes
of
--
of
a
judge
to
have
a
--
a
subpoena
evaded
and
another
thing
if
the
--
if
the
person
evading
the
subpoena
comes
in
and
gives
either
purged
testimony
or
--
or
the
equivalent
of
it
on
the
--
on
the
hearing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
might
--
it
might
not
be
considered
that
--
that
those
two
things
combined
or
much
more
serious
offense
than
if
the
person
had
just
evaded
through
--
through
in
action
or
negligence
or
something
of
that
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
they
could
send
it
back
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
.--
they
can
send
it
back
to
the
district
court
in
the
light
of
this
changed
position
of
the
government
wherein
you
abandon
that
your
case
on
--
on
two
counts
of
the
three.
they
could
do
the
same
thing
that
we
do,
could
they
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
say
you
think
would
not
be
improper
for
us
to
do,
they
could
then
--
they
could
send
the
case
back,
cleaned
up
to
the
--
to
the
district
court
to
--
to
do
what
it's
all
fit
in
that
regard,
could
they
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
there
would
be
anything
improper
in
that
procedure
if
we
believe
that
it
should
go
back
to
any
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
mr.
solicitor
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gressman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gressman,
as
i
understood
you
this
organization,
this
mayflower
corporation
is
both
a
sales
organization
and
a
service
organization.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
do
they
sell
anything
other
than
slot
machines?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
do
that
too.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
coin
operated
machines.
chief
justice
earl
warren
tell
me
how
--
how
big
was
this
business?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
know
how
many
employees
they
have?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
point
i'm
getting
at
is
would
it
be
an
insuperable
task
to
distinguish
between
the
items
of
service
and
the
items
of
sale
in
that
--
in
a
business
of
that
size?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
would
it
be
difficult,
do
you
think,
to
--
was
it
so
large
that
it'd
be
difficult
to
segregate
the
slot
machines
from
the
sales
of
cigarette
machines,
gum
machines
and
things
of
that
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
might
--
it
might
take
them
that
time
to
go
through
but
should
it
take
anyone
who
knows
the
bookkeeping
system
of
the
company
who
was
an
officer
of
the
company
and
--
and
who
is
the
one
that
the
--
that
the
company
selected
to
--
to
make
this
return
on
the
subpoena?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he's
the
one
--
he's
the
one
that
the
corporation
chose
to
make
this
return
before
it,
isn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
all
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
--
does
the
corporation
or
--
or
does
the
--
the
petitioner
here
claimed
that
he
was
not
the
proper
person,
that
someone
else
should
have
--
should
have
done
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
is
it
claimed
in
the
--
in
the
trial
court
when
these
proceedings
are
going
along?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
one
of
the
things
that
--
that
bothers
me
here
is
that
if
--
if
the
court
issues
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
to
--
to
a
corporation
and
the
corporation
chooses
anyone
at
once
to
respond
to
the
--
to
the
subpoena,
it
chooses
the
vice
president
of
the
--
of
the
company
and
he
doesn't
produce
the
records
and
he's
committed
for
contempt,
should
it
be
open
to
him
or
to
the
corporation
to
say,
“well,
we
didn't
--
we
didn't
have
the
proper
person
return
this.
you
can't
hold
this
man
accountable
because
he
really
didn't
--
he
really
didn't
know
anything
about
what
we
should
have
done
was
to
have
our
--
our
controller
or
head
bookkeeper
or
somebody
else
who
knows
the
record
to
this
but
this
man
didn't
so
--
so
there's
no
way
of
enforcing
a
subpoena.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
was
pretty
closely
connected
with
this
whole
subject
matter,
wasn't
he,
he
was
an
original
defendant
in
a
criminal
conspiracy
that
the
others
were
convicted
of,
he
happened
to
be
acquitted.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
was
all
before
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
he
was
asked
to
do
this
and
i
assume
we
can
infer
that
he
was
apparently
--
he
was
very
familiar
with
the
records
of
his
company
in
the
trial
in
which
he
was
acquitted.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
fully
considered
in
discretion.
