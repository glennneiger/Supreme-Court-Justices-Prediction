chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
belcher,
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
that
the
applicable
rules
of
the
supreme
court
was
difficult
at
the
time
of
johnson
versus
the
state
bar
and
at
that
time,
all
that
were
required
from
you
is
to
make
an
application
for
review.
and
since
that
time,
the
rule
was
(inaudible)
that
require
both
in
the
petition,
(inaudible)
brief.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
they
didn't
require
it.
they
didn't
require
it,
but
--
but
they
do
now.
all
that's
required
of
them
is
an
application,
not
--
as
to
first
time,
as
i
understand
it,
it
require
both
and
the
briefs,
isn't
that
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
belcher,
i'm
not
quite
clear
yet
(inaudible)
your
position
is
that
declamation
of
--
of
the
petitioner
to
answer
this
question
that
constituted
failure
to
show
his
good
moral
character
or
whether
it
was
his
continuous
association
testified
to
by
most
of
defendant
as
of
the
year
1943
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
must
be
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
that
(inaudible)
let
us
suppose
he's
been
(inaudible)
in
1943,
he
was
and
congress
says.
he
was
entitled
at
that
time
to
register
into
congress
under
california
law
and
to
vote
in
congress
under
california
law,
if
he
had
that
vote
would
that
in
and
of
itself
have
been
a
demonstration
or
lack
of
good
moral
character
if
the
committee
chose
so
preserve.

chief

swell,
that
be
if
it
goes
(inaudible)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
determining
what
the
case,
but
i
did
want
to
get
in
my
mind
what
the
fact
was
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
am
i
correct
mr.
belcher
in
my
recollection
that
all
the
way
from
1950
or
1949
(inaudible)
his
time
with
the
university
of
california,
the
loyalty
oath
(inaudible)
in
the
garner
case,
that
that
was
introduced
in
the
legislature
by
the
defending
committee
to
compel
all
lawyers
to
take
the
loyalty
oath
in
that
state
bar
of
sacramento
and
the
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
it's
barred,
not
required.
i'm
not
sure

chief
justice
earl
warren

don't
know
anybody
else
who
