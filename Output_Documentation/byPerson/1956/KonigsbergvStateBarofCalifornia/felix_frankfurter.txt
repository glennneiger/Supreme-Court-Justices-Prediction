justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
the
first
amendment,
what
part
of
it
--
assuming
--
assuming
it's
already
--
you're
not
here
on
the
first
amendment.
you
can
only
be
here
under
fourteenth.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
then
the
fourteenth
that
is
infused
from
the
summary,
what
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
he
ask
to
be
permitted
to
speak?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
what
part?
was
it
an
abridgment
speech,
the
abridgment
of
speech
that
was
involved?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
abridgment
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
not
abridgment
of
speech.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
the
difference
and
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
right
of
association
was
the
encroachment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
can
understand
your
argument
that
he
had
a
right
to
belong
to
the
communist
party.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
you're
arguing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
all
vague
and
looks
upon
the
first
amendment.
the
first
amendment
would
be
--
what
fifth
amendment
would
(inaudible)
to
other
people?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
understand
that,
but
i
would
like
to
have
a
particular
delineation
of
definite
and
the
indication,
what
part,
what
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
other
than
arbitrary
determination
that
he
can't
practice
law.
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
but
when
you
talk
first
amendment,
you
talk
something
that
i
don't
understand
unless
you
define
it.
every
time
we
got
any
objection
in
this
court,
now
they
only
say
first
amendment
as
i've
said
it,
other
claims
refers
specifically
and
all
sorts
(inaudible),
the
first
amendment,
the
next
amendment
apply.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
the
general
interpretation?
do
you
mean
to
say
the
state
statutes
require
him
in
his
--
lots
of
belief
that
a
man
has?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
all
right.
then,
you
have
to
be
very
particular
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
to
what
it
is
that
he
was
--
that
was
inquired
as
to
this.
what
is
the
inquiry
with
us
to
testify
about
that
disclose
everything?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
such
decision
of
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
the
claim
that
life
or
--
life
and
liberty
over
property
may
not
arbitrarily
that
they
could
take,
that
is,
without
any
justification
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
pursuant
calling
or
the
exercise
of
what
has
been
deemed
as
human
right.
i
understand
that.
when
you
talk
first
amendment
that
goes
from
abracadabra,
you
loosely
complete,
gain
others
but
you
loosely
complete.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
that
we
shouldn't
discuss
that,
i
just
want
you
to
know
it
means
nothing
to
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
to
close
my
analysis.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
like
you
to
know
why
i
think
this.
for
decades
some
of
us
fought
against
this
court
declaring
stuff
unconstitutional
on
vague
general
grounds
and
that's
the
law
of
human
rights,
the
spirit
of
the
constitution
and
i
think
the
objection
to
that
law
of
applying
the
constitution
applies
to
every
provision
of
the
constitution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
why
do
you
make
that
concession?
why
must
a
man
be
forced
to
tell
his
secret
thoughts
about
whatever
the
hardships
and
pain
in
court
that
an
occasion
of
bloodletting
if
i
may
quote
jefferson,
is
a
good
thing
in
view
of
the
advantages
that
may
come.
why
must
he
disclose
that
private
thought?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
that
put
--
that
put
this
--
consists
on
the
fact
that
he
did
answer
the
question
or
did
assert
that
he
does
not
believe
in
force
and
violence.
why
if
you
are
right
in
that
to
be
forced,
why
must
we
ask
that
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
calling
your
stand
to
that
question,
would
he
draw
the
line
if
--
whether
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
to
cross-examine
the
witness
also
and
it
were
in
conjunction
with
the
first
answer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
is
outside
the
society.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
does
not
stand
outside
the
society
and
he
had
relations
that
amongst
--
my
point
of
view,
the
most
indispensable
aspect
that
he
in
--
a
part
of
society,
namely,
the
judicial
system.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
court
systems,
the
administration
of
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
answer
me
to
what
gain,
i
do
not
see
why
you
emphasize
that
--
that
whatever
may
be
full
of
teachers
and
policemen
and
plumbers
is
not
applicable
to
lawyers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he's
not
that
--
i
think
it's
extraordinary.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
mosk,
suppose
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
mosk
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
suppose
this
situation
and
i'd
like
to
put
on
one
side
but
i
don't
suppose
it's
an
assumption
of
yours
that
only
crime
he
commits
penally
violates
the
penal
statute
that's
involved
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
if
we
talk
about
crime,
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
think
dozens
of
questions
would
be
higher
than
it
is,
but
isn't
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
--
the
question
i
want
to
put
you
is
this.
suppose
a
member
of
this
committee
after
he
said
he's
not
a
philosophical
communist,
i
don't
know
what
that
means.
why
he
should
be
ready
to
say
that,
not
rather
say
some
other
things
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no.
i'm
not
asking.
but
suppose
after
he
said
he
was
not
a
philosophical
communist,
(inaudible)
that's
apparent.
and
suppose
this
woman,
this
witness
before
the
committee
then
--
perhaps
i
should
(inaudible)
suppose
the
member
of
the
committee
doesn't
affect
the
problem
that
you
can
express,
you
said
that
you're
not
a
philosophical
communist.
so
far
as
i
am
concerned,
i
do
not
think
membership
in
the
communist
party
as
in
the
court
would
be
a
barred
admission.
we
don't
have
to
rest
on
the
decisions
of
each
case
by
the
supreme
court
but
that
is
my
view,
at
least
being
provided.
but
this
lady
before
us
the
other
day
said
you
were
a
member
and
active
in
a
cell
on
which
she
then
was
a
(inaudible)
i'm
not
suggesting
on
the
facts
(inaudible)
and
this
member
of
the
committee
says,
“i
want
to
make
it
perfectly
clear
to
you
(inaudible)”
“yes,
i
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.”
i,
for
one
do
not
think
that's
a
bar
and
i
think
it's
illegal.
but
i
do
realize
the
right
and
find
out
from
you
whether
you're
telling
the
truth,
of
course.
and
i
should
like
to
determine
whether
this
lady
is
truthful
or
not
with
what
she
said
if
he
was
a
remember
of
this
cell,
because
if
she's
right
about
that
and
i'd
like
to
ask
you
more
questions
about
your
--
this
claim
of
not
being
a
philosophical
communist.
do
i
make
clear
my
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
if
the
district
attorney
says,
“your
honor,
you're
including
a
problem,
unconstitutionally
protected
territory
and
i
want
to
inquire.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
added
to
that.
before
i
make
an
admission,
i
know
there
are
other
members
on
the
committee
but
this
questioner
stated
that
his
search
for
evidence
was
not
to
bar
him
because
of
communist
connection
or
affiliation
or
sympathy
but
that
is
the
lawyer
given
the
right
to
ascertain
whether
this
is
the
truth
telling
a
person.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
i
dislike
the
abstract
requirements
on
what
ought
to
be
complete
doctrine.
if
you
say
you
can't
inquire
and
led
you
to
believe
a
person,
cut
off
all
the
right,
all
the
analysis
are
for.
there
must
have
been
continued
inquiry.
i
don't
understand
what
the
question
is,
its
pertinency,
the
context
in
which
you've
asked,
etcetera,
etcetera.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'd
--
i'd
like
to
interrupt
on
teachers.
maybe
it's
my
occupational
prejudice
but
i
hold
an
opinion
some
years
ago
which
i
thought
that
freedom
ought
to
be
most
respected,
at
least
with
much
respect
in
regard
to
teachers
being
a
part
of
the
community.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
to
try
that
in
this
court.
this
notion
that
you
put
teachers
in
a
classroom
could
be
(inaudible)
and
should
be
treated
more
roughly
and
more
restrictedly
than
lawyers,
i
should
like
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
surely
have
said
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i've
said
that
because
teachers,
if
they've
got
narrow
speaking
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
because
they
were
teachers.
i'm
speaking
for
myself.
i
answered
some
remarks
on
this
circuit
to
the
effect
the
position
that
a
teacher
has.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wouldn't
say
that
this
adds
more
just
to
lawyers
--
to
lawyers
but
i
would
have
had
to
say
lawyers
had
immunity
that
teachers
have.
justice
felix
frankfurter
regretting
the
question
when
you
say
not
basing
that
on
the
words
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
that
such
is
the
truth
of
it
is
an
assertion
to
his
--
into
his
words.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
could
be
an
admissible
binding
inquiry
before
a
man
is
admitted
to
the
bar.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
would
think
lawyers
and
priests
and
doctors
ascertained
from
them
is
exacted
--
from
them
exacted
the
habit
of
truth
by
as
much
as
anybody
who
has
anything
in
this
society.
i
would
not
accept
teachers
for
that
because
i
do
not
think
there's
any
profession
more
important
than
the
profession
of
training
the
next
generation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
--
suppose
the
witness
draws
before
this
committee.
i'm
asking
these
questions
because
in
all
cases,
the
worth
of
evidence
in
case
of
following
through
implications
not
only
on
the
most
obvious
and
so-called
freedom,
but
also
in
the
relations
of
the
reviewing
parties
brought
into
state
action
with
admission
to
the
bar.
suppose
the
witness
came
before
the
--
this
committee
and
said,
“the
candidate
told
me
yesterday
that
he's
going
to
refuse
to
answer
any
of
the
questions
because
if
he
answers
them
truthfully,
he
is
getting
the
difficulties
and
of
course
doesn't
want
to
subject
himself
to
perjury.”
suppose
a
witness
came
before
that
committee
and
the
committee
--
a
member
of
the
committee
then
--
mr.
konigsberg,
you
heard,
you
were
present,
mrs.
williams,
mrs.
jacobs
or
mr.
frank
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
might
have
testified
to
that.
did
you
or
did
you
not
say
that
(inaudible)
could
you
atleast
answer
that
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
question
has
to
be
dealt
with
as
a
question.
if
you
can't
say
you
don't,
you
can't
answer
this
although
the
proper
question,
“are
you
constitutionally
not
protected
because
the
question
may
then
cover
up
an
improper
question?”
you
can't
upset
the
state
judge
on
that
kind
of
reading.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
my
difficulty.
i
don't
know
what
the
--
i
don't
know
what
that
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
constitution
doesn't
talk
about
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
only
on
specific
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
pro
forma
you're
suggesting.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pro
forma
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
your
supreme
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
the
court
of
origination,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
this
kind
of
a
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
why
wasn't
--
why
isn't
that
raising
the
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
take
two
minutes?
you
don't
have
to
take
more
to
the
same
point
that
mr.
mosk
(inaudible)
to
the
supreme
court
to
california,
is
that
in
your
brief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
point?
what
was
the
basis
on
which
in
the
supreme
court
of
california,
the
present
petitioner
sought
to
overturn
or
deny
admission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
legal
point
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
which
they
claim
the
bar
association
committed
error?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
under
the
(inaudible)
just
before
you
go
to
five,
the
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
is
there
anything
under
(d)
that
would
indicate
that
the
issue
would
be
demonstrated
here
or
a
contention
raised.
i
don't
mean
in
common
words
an
infringement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
one
would
have
to
leave
it
on
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
the
situation
you
felt
(inaudible)
that
the
very
important
couple
of
questions
are
here
and
i
just
want
to
know
whether
on
this
(inaudible)
of
the
case,
this
is
a
situation.
do
you
contend
that
it's
the
rule
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
and
therefore
(inaudible)
although
a
statute
in
the
constitution
(inaudible)
that
it's
the
rule
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
that
no
matter
how
explicitly
or
elaborately,
the
federal
constitutional
question
is
raised
in
a
petition
or
the
plea
unless
it
is
argued
in
the
initial
brief
(inaudible)
the
petitioner
in
this
case
unless
it
is
argued
in
a
brief,
it
is
deemed
not
to
be
before
the
court,
the
supreme
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
you
said
further
that
if
we
leave
mr.
mosk's
reading
of
the
supreme
court
of
california,
we
read
the
decisions
of
the
court
of
california
on
this
point
in
your
view
there'd
be
no
doubt
left
on
(inaudible)
if
that
is
so,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
to
save
a
lot
of
time.
it
was
(inaudible)
--
he
was
even
able
to
read
that,
(inaudible)
if
it's
a
demonstrable
qualification
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
--
what
does
the
johnson
case
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
johnson
case
say
you
must
express
not
less
than
five
pages
in
argument
at
least
taken.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
wouldn't
you
say
--
wouldn't
you
say
what
was
quoted
on
page
5
raises
the
point
and
maybe
affected
directly
in
the
california
judicature
that
defines
raising
a
point
in
a
very
special
way
but
now
how
did
the
lawyer
raise
the
point
and
just
by
saying,
“i
refuse
to
answer
this
question
because
the
first
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution
made
me
privileged
(inaudible)”
isn't
that
raising
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
year
were
these
articles
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
1953
to
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
the
--
the
year
in
court
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
was
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
i
ask
you,
mr.
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
belcher,
if
--
if
this
witness,
he
had
this
before
your
bar
committee,
a
similar
situation,
perhaps
these
questions
that
have
been
said
in
a
high
standard,
“yes,
i
was
an
enrolling
member
of
the
(inaudible)
the
communist
party
in
1939
to
february
9th,
1957
(inaudible)
since
that
i
have
not
been
and
have
not
(inaudible)
the
communist
party.
would
the
law
of
california
(inaudible)
could
that
bar
him
from
admission
to
the
bar?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
what
that
means.
i'm
no
more
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
merely
because
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
disbarring?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
called
the
man
before
he
--
suppose
the
man
said
he
was
as
a
communist
(inaudible)
until
the
korean
war
entry
is
denied.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
trying
to
prove
your
opinion.
i'm
trying
to
find
out
whether
either
by
a
statutory
provision
that
by
a
ruling
with
your
supreme
court,
admission
to
the
bar
excluded
by
somebody
if
you
plead
as
now,
i'm
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
is
the
statute
of
--
is
the
statute
of
california
dispose
this?
i've
been
talking
about
force
and
violence.
i'm
talking
merely
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
the
man
is
on
the
witness
stand
and
you
were
a
member
of
the
bar
committee
and
he
says,
“i
am
not
a
member
of
the
communist
party.”
i
was
(inaudible)
as
i
could
quote
california
and
(inaudible),
so
far
as
i
know,
but
i
completely
disbelieve
in
force
and
violence.
there's
no
stopping
it.
i
take
no
(inaudible)
and
a
lot
of
people
take
no
(inaudible)
with
that
he
respond.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
know
as
a
matter
of
law
so
far
as
yours
ascertain
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
that
go
or
put
there
because
of
that
statement,
because
of
that
particularly
is
not
likely
to
(inaudible)
his
moral
character.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
could
say,
nobody
--
what
i
want
to
know
is
could
the
committee
of
the
--
could
the
bar
examiners
writing
the
opinion
to
say
their
attitudes
so
much
of
this
petitioner
has
admitted
that
he
was
a
communist
from
1947
to
1950.
(inaudible)
bring
down
the
korean
war,
1950.
he
then
speaks,
he
believes
in
it
that
he
no
longer
cares.
but
because
he
was
at
the
1950
there,
in
our
opinion,
he
would
be
likely
--
he
would
(inaudible)
--
likely
with
good
moral
character
for
--
assuming
the
bar
committee
(inaudible)
the
supreme
court
of
california
say
that's
all
i
have.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
want
to
know
whether
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
it
isn't
hypothetical
to
me
to
desire
to
know
whether
the
membership
in
a
--
in
the
communist
party
as
such
is
proof
of
lack
of
moral
character.
justice
felix
frankfurter
united
states
--
the
proposal
is
the
same,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
you
be
modest
about
the
bar
because
as
i
went
to
the
house
of
delegation,
that
is
one
of
its
noble
proposals
on
the
present
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
you
did
oppose
the
policy
of
the
house
of
delegates'
proposal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
that
the
american
bar
proposal
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
the
california
bar
upholds
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
[laughs]
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
get
on
to
the
merits
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
read
the
johnson
case
and
the
reference
it
was
made.
i
must
say
your
supreme
court
has
dealt
with
what
i
call
a
process
which
just
say
(inaudible)
is
unconstitutional
without
the
citation
of
authority
or
an
argument
other
than
an
attack
upon
the
method
of
the
state
bar
as
it
appears.
if
the
rule
will
separate
such
--
such
a
presentation
the
substance
is
sufficient,
requires
it
to
pass
upon
the
point
suggested.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
must
be
rather
surprised
(inaudible)
just
say
the
question
is
vague
and
raise
them.
in
fact,
i
don't
know
whether
he
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
doesn't
raise
the
question
as
to
which
i'm
wholly
uninformed.
but
does
it
--
there's
one
reason
that
they
want
more
than
just
to
say
i
employ
the
first
amendment
not
the
fourteenth,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
what
is
covered,
what
is
relevant
is
that
it
decides
to
declare
of
a
proceeding.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
probably
the
beauty
of
it.
there
are
no
cases
to
be
cited
for
this
argument.
