justice
harold
burton
but
before
your
complete
reaction,
i
--
i
understand
that
the
answer
as
to
whether
or
not
but
refusing
to
say
whether
he's
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
justice
harold
burton
so,
the
only
part
of
the
record
clearly
a
desire
not
to
say
whether
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
justice
harold
burton
but
actually
he
did
answer.
justice
harold
burton
he
answered
that
he
was
opposed
to
force
and
violence.
justice
harold
burton
and
he
refused
to
--
to
say
whether
or
not
he
was
or
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
is
that
correct?
justice
harold
burton
and
that
was
on
the
basis
of
the
findings
as
to
the
first
amendment.
justice
harold
burton
well,
his
moral
principle
was
(inaudible)
justice
harold
burton
he
has
to
have
a
constitutional
protection.
justice
harold
burton
and
in
behalf
of
answering
the
first
(inaudible)
in
answer
to
questions,
did
he
(inaudible)
other
than
that.
justice
harold
burton
well,
i
think
it's
whether
he
was
in
favor
of
overthrowing
the
government
by
force
and
violence
and
that's
the
basis
for
his
moral
character?
justice
harold
burton
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
harold
burton
yes,
he
responded
to
that.
justice
harold
burton
now,
some
people
may
think
a
communist
party
(inaudible)
justice
harold
burton
(inaudible)
suppose
those
are
all
matters
apart
from
what
i'm
asking.
i'm
trying
to
find
how
far
this
man
going
up
(inaudible)
and
so
forth
answered
the
questions
that
were
asked
and
you
make
him
respond
to
the
question,
“are
you
in
favor
of
force
and
violence
to
overthrow
the
government?”
justice
harold
burton
he
did?
justice
harold
burton
now,
that
he
is
--
you
say
he's
not
required
to
answer
the
question
on
this
court.
justice
harold
burton
all
the
theory
i
suppose,
that
is
a
case
(inaudible)
--
justice
harold
burton
--
(inaudible)
to
force
and
violence.
justice
harold
burton
some
people
might
think
that
some
(inaudible)
that
he
gives
more
opportunities
to
go
into
the
membership
(inaudible)
that's
what
you
objected
to.
justice
harold
burton
(inaudible)
to
the
factual
question,
i'm
just
trying
to
get
the
first
one.
whether
or
not
he
must
respond
to
each
question,
he
says,
“unless
for
constitutional
reasons
to
keep
from
answering.”
justice
harold
burton
(inaudible)
justice
harold
burton
(inaudible)
justice
harold
burton
well,
what
is
on
moral
character?
justice
harold
burton
a
lawyer
to
use
--
do
you
say
that
the
bar
(inaudible)
justice
harold
burton
that
--
that
may
be
but
his
moral
character
does
involve
(inaudible)
in
the
practice
of
law.
justice
harold
burton
all
right,
just
on
--
i'm
a
little
over
(inaudible)
just
to
your
position
in
regard
to
the
obligation
of
petitioner
to
make
the
implied
questions
that
have
no
constitutional
effect.
justice
harold
burton
why
do
you
believe
or
would
you
--
what
do
you
obtain
in
that.
would
--
would
you
be
willing
to
engage
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence?
now,
is
that
a
substantive
question
to
ask?
justice
harold
burton
does
he
--
does
he
have
to
answer
that
question?
because
they're
trying
to
remember
--
is
it
like
the
prosecution
in
which
the
prosecuting
officers
must
develop
all
the
evidence
and
bring
it
forth
and
the
defendant
may
refuse
to
testify
at
all,
is
that
your
position?
justice
harold
burton
and
that
has
nothing
to
do.
justice
harold
burton
i'm
asking
you
a
question
whether
in
further
to
draw
this
man
to
answer,
or
is
he
protected
by
criminal
defense?
justice
harold
burton
then
he
must
answer
some
questions.
justice
harold
burton
questions
that
are
pertinent
to
his
moral
character?
justice
harold
burton
he
could
be
--
he
could
be
asked
whether
he's
ever
been
in
the
penitentiary.
justice
harold
burton
the
information
that
of
his
name
was
(inaudible)
justice
harold
burton
and
--
and
as
to
his
--
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence
you
think,
he
didn't
have
to
answer.
i've
decided
the
word
(inaudible)
justice
harold
burton
what
if
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
what
was
this
--
his
action
on
the
subject
(inaudible)
justice
harold
burton
that's
his
association?
justice
harold
burton
to
find
out
whether
he
was
(inaudible)
or
a
criminal.
justice
harold
burton
(inaudible)
justice
harold
burton
and
not
the
conspiracy?
justice
harold
burton
suppose
the
record
have
said
it.
justice
harold
burton
(inaudible)
justice
harold
burton
he
refused
on
the
ground
(inaudible)
justice
harold
burton
in
other
words,
he
refused
to
answer
on
the
ground
(inaudible)
justice
harold
burton
is
that
the
ground
in
which
he
was
denied
admission?
