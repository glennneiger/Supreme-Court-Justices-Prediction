mr.
edward
mosk
i'm
ready
for
the
petition,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
mosk
yes.
mr.
edward
mosk
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
mr.
belcher.
this
case
arise
before
this
court
by
reason
of
the
action
of
the
committee
of
bar
examiners
in
the
state
of
california
in
denying
the
petitioner
admission
to
the
bar
of
california
by
reason
of
his
alleged
views,
opinions
and
associations.
under
the
state
bar
act
of
california,
the
committee
of
bar
examiners
is
empowered
to
certify
to
the
supreme
court
applicants
who
fulfill
certain
requirements.
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
petitioner
here
fulfilled
all
of
the
educational,
age,
residence
and
other
requirements
of
this
sort.
there
are
in
addition,
two
other
requirements.
one
is
that
the
applicant
be
a
person
of
good
moral
character,
and
the
second
is
that
the
legislature
in
california
has
said
that
no
person
who
advocates
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence
or
other
unconstitutional
means
shall
be
certified.
now,
shortly
before
the
time
that
the
petitioner
here
took
the
bar
examination
in
the
state
of
california,
he
was
called
in
before
the
committee
of
bar
examiners
and
asked
certain
questions
relative
to
his
qualifications.
he
thereafter,
with
the
consent
of
the
committee
took
the
bar
examination
and
passed
it
so
that
there
are
no
impediments
other
than
the
position
of
the
committee
of
bar
examiners
that
the
petitioner
here
has
not
sustained
his
burden
of
proof.
that
he
is
a
person
of
good
moral
character,
and
they
state
he
has
not
sustained
his
burden
of
proof
that
he
does
not
believe
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
now,
over
a
period
of
time,
there
were
four
hearings
held
before
the
committee
of
bar
examiners.
three,
before
this
other
in
subsection
and
then
a
final
hearing
in
effect
that
de
novo
hearing
before
the
full
committee
of
these
bar
examiners
for
the
state
of
california.
in
the
course
of
these
hearings,
the
following
facts
were
basically
established.first
of
all,
the
petitioner
himself,
the
background
of
the
petitioner,
a
graduate
of
ohio
state
university
in
1931,
later
getting
a
master's
degree
in
social
work,
taught
history
and
english
literature
in
the
cleveland
high
school.
he
was
a
supervisor
in
the
department
of
health
here
in
washington,
d.c.
he
was
a
research
director
of
the
council
of
social
agencies
in
los
angeles.
he
was
a
supervisor
for
the
state
relief
administration
in
california.
he
was
a
director
of
social
services
in
the
city
of
hope
sanitarium
in
duarte,
california.subsequently,
in
the
--
during
the
war,
he
became
a
captain
and
he
--
and
was
in
charge
of
information
and
education
for
some
400,000
soldiers
in
germany
in
the
seventh
army.
and
three
times,
he
was
a
candidate
for
public
office
in
los
angeles,
twice
for
the
board
of
education
and
once
for
the
state
assembly.
the
record
contains
no
single
fact
other
than
those
which
i
shall
refer
to
in
a
moment,
indicating
anything
about
his
work
record,
his
personal
record,
his
life
in
the
community
of
los
angeles
other
than
the
very
highest
recommendation
as
to
his
character.
in
addition,
the
petitioner
brought
before
the
committee
of
bar
examiners
some
40
letters
from
every
single
stage
of
his
life
as
a
social
worker
in
the
hospitals,
in
the
army,
everything,
in
--
in
the
university.
he
brought
letters
from
persons
like
right
reverend
monsignor
dwyer,
from
rabbi
jed
cohen,
community
leaders
all
indicating
that
he
had
an
impeccable
personal
record
in
his
community.
now,
at
the
hearings,
the
committee
commenced
by
introducing
and
showing
to
the
petitioner
a
series
of
articles
which
he
had
written
during
a
brief
period
of
employment
with
a
los
angeles
newspaper
known
as
the
california
eagle.
this
is
a
newspaper
of
weekly
circulation
and
primarily
--
primary
circulation
is
in
the
negro
community
of
los
angeles.
these
articles
were
vigorous,
pungent,
strong,
challenging
political
articles
but
all
dealing
with
the
political
--
were
all
commentaries
on
the
political
affairs
of
the
day.
these
articles
were
introduced
and
shown
to
the
petitioner.
he
acknowledged
that
he
had
written
them
over
a
period
of
about
a
year
and
he
was
asked
at
various
times.
“do
you
still
believe
the
things
that
are
in
these
articles?
would
you
write
the
same
articles
today?”
and
a
number
of
questions
of
that
sort.
now,
he
further
introduced
testimony.
there
was
further
introduced
certain
testimony
that
in
one
point
he
had
appeared
before
a
--
the
california
senate
investigating
committee,
commonly
known
as
the
tenney
committee.
and
he
was
asked
whether
the
testimony
that
he
had
given
at
that
time
before
that
committee
would
be
his
opinion
at
this
time,
and
he
was
shown
a
written
statement
that
he
had
introduced
at
that
time
and
asked
whether
he
still
believe
these
things
to
be
true.
now,
he
was
also
asked
whether
or
not
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
there
was
introduced
a
witness
who
came
before
the
committee
who
testified
that
sometime
in
1941
or
1942,
the
petitioner
had
been
a
member
of
a
small
group
in
the
communist
party
with
this
--
with
this
witness.
she
was
asked
on
cross-examination
whether
or
not
what
was
said
at
the
meetings,
she
recalled
nothing
that
was
said
in
any
of
the
meetings.
she
was
asked
whether
there
was
any
discussion
of
advocacy
of
force
and
violence,
she
said,
she
didn't
remember
anything
that
anybody
said
including
this
petitioner
at
any
of
those
meetings.
so
that
there
was
no
evidence
presented
at
the
hearings
other
than
the
--
their
testimony
that
he
--
that
this
witness
who
incidentally
went
under
cross-examination,
when
asked
how
she
knew
this
petitioner
she
said,
“well,
he's
the
only
face
in
the
room
that's
familiar
to
me,
so
he
must
be
konigsberg.”
but
assuming
that
the
--
that
there
was
some
element
of
identification,
the
only
testimony
that
there
was,
was
the
bare
testimony
that
he
may
have
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
in
1940
or
1941.
now,
he
was
asked
questions
regarding
an
advocacy
of
force
and
violence.
he
answered,
responded
to
every
such
question
and
not
once
but
about
six
times
during
the
course
of
the
hearings.
he
said
specifically,
“i
do
not.
i
never
have.
i
never
will.
my
entire
record,
my
entire
background
is
contrary
to
any
belief
in
doctrines
of
force
and
violence.”
he
did
on
one
occasion
respond
to
a
question,
“are
you
a
communist?”
and
he
answered
to
this
question,
“no,”
if
you
mean
by
that,
a
philosophical
communist.
there
was
some
colloquy
between
the
committee
and
the
petitioner
at
this
point
in
which
he
indicated
that
what
he
was
trying
to
distinguish
was
between
his
belief
in
jeffersonian
democracy
which
did
not
mean
advocacy
of
force
and
violence
and
their
interpretation
apparently
of
communist
party
membership.
so
that
he
specifically
denied
that
he
was
a
communist.
he
declined
to
answer
repeatedly
saying
that
this
is
solely
on
the
basis
of
high
moral
principle.
he
said
that
this
is
not
self-incrimination.
i
am
not
relying
on
the
fifth
amendment.
i'm
relying
solely
on
the
first
amendment
and
my
--
my
deep
abiding
feeling
that
you
have
no
right
to
inquire
into
this
area.
mr.
edward
mosk
the
--
at
the
very
beginning,
your
honor,
there
was
some
reference
to
his
saying,
“well,
you
can
bring
lots
of
nameless
informers.”
but
i
think
a
--
a
careful
examination
of
each
of
the
references
that
he
made
would
indicate
that
the
basic
reference
was
that
on
the
basis
of
the
first
amendment
they
had
no
right
to
inquire.
he
did
make
such
comments.
i
think
on
perhaps
one
or
two
of
the
occasions.
mr.
edward
mosk
yes.
there
--
there
were
such
references,
your
honor.
however,
the
--
the
basic
position
that
he
took
with
regard
to
his
refusal
was
this
is
a
first
amendment
position
and
you
have
no
right
to
inquire.
thereafter,
of
course,
they
did
bring
a
--
they
did
bring
a
witness
before
them
and
from
that
point
on
certainly,
any
references
that
he
made
were
always
to
his
--
his
basic
first
amendment
position.
now,
the
only
--
mr.
edward
mosk
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
mosk
well,
we
have
two
--
mr.
edward
mosk
we
have
the
--
the
first
amendment
as
included
within
the
fourteenth.
mr.
edward
mosk
the
--
the
abridgment
of
speech
and
--
mr.
edward
mosk
he
was
being
required,
your
honor,
to
--
to
speak
as
to
his
associations
and
in
connection
with
the
articles
and
--
mr.
edward
mosk
well,
it
--
it
comes,
your
honor,
from
the
--
the
whole
feeling
that
one
must
not
--
we
must
not
encroach
on
the
right
of
association.
mr.
edward
mosk
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
mosk
the
encroachment
was
that
--
mr.
edward
mosk
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
mosk
that
is
part
of
our
argument,
your
honor,
but
it
is
not
the
basis
in
which
we're
here.
mr.
edward
mosk
well,
what
we
have
here,
your
honor
is
the
--
by
the
use
of
this
testimony
and
the
kind
of
questions
that
they
are
asking
him
in
the
area
in
which
he
declined
to
answer,
we
have
a
situation
where
they
are
coming
up
with
an
arbitrary
determination
of
his
unfitness,
so
far
as
his
good
moral
character
is
concerned.
mr.
edward
mosk
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
mosk
well,
in
this
case
your
honor,
what
we
have
is
a
--
and
i
--
i
think
is
basically
a
margin
of
the
general
freedom
to
be
--
to
be
free
from
inquiry
into
one's
beliefs,
one's
associations
which
are
generally
interpreted
as
coming
within
the
first
amendment
protections
as
protected
by
--
mr.
edward
mosk
i
would
not
say
that
they
cannot,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
mosk
all
right,
in
--
mr.
edward
mosk
right.
in
this,
the
--
the
substance
of
the
first
amendment
as
it
is
grown
as
i
understand
it,
your
honor,
is
that
there
are
areas
of
--
of
speech,
of
political
association
which
we
say
that
society
will
prevent
that
the
values
to
society
are
such
that
the
encroachment
of
the
state
by
asking
questions
or
inquiring
into
on
asking
the
person
to
give
up
his
rights
in
this
area
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
edward
mosk
i
think
perhaps
your
honor,
in
a
sense
we
may
be
asking
this
court
to
go
further
than
it
has
in
any
case
in
this
area.
but
in
this
case
of
course,
what
we
have
is
a
determination
which
comes
within
the
arbitrary
determinations
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
this
of
course
is
basically
what
we're
--
we're
--
mr.
edward
mosk
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
mosk
all
right.
mr.
edward
mosk
well,
i
--
i
suspect
that
perhaps,
i'm
using
it
more
loosely
--
mr.
edward
mosk
i
--
i
think
perhaps
your
honor
--
mr.
edward
mosk
if
i
may,
i
think
that
by
the
time,
perhaps
i
have
concluded
my
remarks.
i
may
have
been
able
to
tie
it
up
so
that
you
will
see
a
little
more
clearly
what
--
at
least
as
we
see
it,
how
the
two
are
tied
up.
but
basically
of
course,
we're
here
on
basically
--
mr.
edward
mosk
now
--
mr.
edward
mosk
i
shall
indeed,
your
honor.
now,
we
--
i
think
that
that
probably
gives
a
fair
appraisal
of
the
facts
that
we
have
before
this
court.
and
i
think
basically
all
of
the
facts
that
are
essential
to
a
determination.
mr.
edward
mosk
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
mosk
it
is
a
little
more
than
that
i
think
from
the
record,
your
honor.
at
a
subsequent
hearing,
when
he
was
questioned,
why
do
you
answer
one
question
and
not
the
other?
he
indicated
that
that
subsequent
hearing
that
he
felt
that
perhaps
he
had
violated
his
principles
in
even
answering
the
philosophical
question,
and
if
he
were
asked
it
again
he
would
decline
on
the
same
basis.
mr.
edward
mosk
actually,
he
did
answer
the
--
mr.
edward
mosk
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
mosk
that
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
mosk
that
is
correct
and
high
moral
principle
that
he
also
indicated.
mr.
edward
mosk
well,
his
--
his
moral
principle
was
--
mr.
edward
mosk
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
mosk
the
--
as
we
see
it,
the
burden
is
on
him
to
answer
any
questions
that
go
directly
to
his
fitness
to
practice
law.
it
is
our
position
that
several
--
we
have
several
answers
to
this
particular
question.
one
is
that
whether
or
not
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
had
--
communist
party
or
no
relationship
to
the
type
of
things
which
are
important
for
the
--
for
the
practice
of
law.
mr.
edward
mosk
well,
now
you
see
--
mr.
edward
mosk
there,
we
--
he
has
responded
to
the
questions
on
force
and
violence.
mr.
edward
mosk
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
mosk
right.
now,
on
that
your
honor,
the
second
question
asked
after
the
first
question
has
been
asked
and
answered,
avails
the
questioner
nothing.
the
cases
before
this
court
and
apparently
respondent
pretty
much
concedes
that
simple
communist
party
membership
without
scienter
would
not
be
sufficient
to
base
their
decision.
so
that
having
gone
backwards
from
the
second
question,
that
is,
“i
do
not
believe
my
whole
lifetime
indicates
that
i
do
not
believe
it,”
and
even
more
than
that.
this
record
discloses
one
of
the
articles
introduced
by
the
respondent
here
written
before
any
of
the
events
that
are
involved
in
this
case
indicated
that
he
wrote
them.
that
he
did
not
believe
in
force
and
violence,
that
anyone
who
did
believe
in
force
and
violence
should
be
punished
for
it.
so
that
in
the
state
of
this
record
indicating
the
denial,
indicating
additional
affirmative
proof,
indicating
letters
from
persons
in
high
positions,
indicating
despite
the
respondent's
statement
that
if
they
don't
go
to
the
issue,
the
letters
for
instance
from
his
law
school
professors
went
to
this
issue.
mr.
edward
mosk
i
am
saying,
yes.
mr.
edward
mosk
yes,
he
did.
mr.
edward
mosk
that
is
--
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
mosk
well
--
mr.
edward
mosk
if
--
mr.
edward
mosk
if
i
may,
perhaps
a
little
extended
but
i
--
this
is
certainly
a
major
point.
i
recognize
that
we
must
respond
to
it,
if
i
may
then
at
this
time
respond
directly
to
that.
mr.
edward
mosk
i
would
say
not,
your
honor,
that
--
mr.
edward
mosk
if
--
if
it
is
pertinent
to
the
questions
which
relate
specifically
to
the
practice
of
law,
and
there's
some
doubt
in
my
mind,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
mosk
well,
i
was
just
going
to
say
--
mr.
edward
mosk
well,
i
--
i
am
not
--
i
did
not
mean
to
concede
that
when
it
comes
to
ideas
into
anywhere
in
the
realm
of
opinions
and
ideas
--
mr.
edward
mosk
if
the
facts
in
this
case
were
other
than
they
are
i
might
very
well
be
arguing
before
this
court
that
this
would
be
improper.
the
facts
that
i
have
before
me
your
honor,
is
that
he
did
respond
to
this
question.
therefore,
i
do
not
think
that
we
are
called
upon
on
the
facts
of
this
case
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
that
statute.
i've
been
trying
to
think
that
the
statute
itself
is
improper.
but
under
the
facts
that
we
have
here,
we're
not
called
upon
to
challenge
that.
mr.
edward
mosk
that
is
correct,
because
that
--
that
would
avail
him
nothing.
it
adds
nothing.
they
--
immediately,
they
asked
him
that
question.
if
you
were
to
answer
the
question,
the
next
one
would
be
in
order
to
have
any
meaning
to
them,
are
you
a
member
of
the
communist
party
who
believes
in
force
and
violence,
but
they've
already
had
the
answer
to
that
question.
so,
they
would
avail
of
nothing
to
take
from
that
--
to
ask
this
question.
mr.
edward
mosk
of
course
they're
not
bound
by
--
mr.
edward
mosk
that's
correct.
and
what
we
have
here,
your
honor,
if
i
may
say
is
we're
dealing
with
an
entirely
different
area
than
i
think
this
court
has
had
to
deal
with
before.
and
i
think
perhaps
this
--
in
line
with
these
questions,
i
should
so
indicate,
we're
not
dealing
with
the
public
employee
here.
we're
not
dealing
even
with
a
teacher
as
important
as
the
independence
of
a
teacher
is
concerned.
we're
not
dealing
with
a
private
employee
here.
we're
not
dealing
with
an
army
officer
as
this
court
has
had
to
deal
in
general
related
cases
before.
we're
dealing
here
with
a
free
and
independent
bar.
we're
dealing
here
with
a
--
with
the
--
a
institution,
the
law
of
a
legal
profession
which
is
absolutely
unique
in
our
society.
we're
dealing
here
with
the
only
group
within
our
society
which
must
remain
absolutely
free
and
independent
of
--
of
the
kinds
of
restraint
that
we
find,
unfortunately
required
in
some
of
these
areas,
because
it's
only
the
lawyer
who
must
stand
between
the
individual
and
society,
who
stands
between
society
and
the
individual
who
protects
society
from
the
individual.
but
at
the
same
time,
it
must
be
the
lawyer
who
must
protect
the
individual
against
his
society.
mr.
edward
mosk
he
is
not
out
--
mr.
edward
mosk
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
mosk
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
but
--
mr.
edward
mosk
let
me
--
let
me
hasten
to
add
that
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
conceding
that
they're
propriety
of
--
of
going
into
these
areas
for
teachers.
but
i
say
that
there
is
a
strong
distinction
because
the
lawyer
from
the
very
beginning,
when
you
try
and
select
who
are
going
to
become
lawyers,
you
must
not
at
the
very
beginning
crush
out
the
selection
of
a
complete
cross
section
of
everyone
who
meets
the
other
requirements
for
the
practice
of
law.
but
if
the
state
of
california
as
it
has
endeavored
to
do
in
this
case
say,
“we
will
select
one
from
another,”
and
this
is
the
word
that
they
used
in
their
own
brief.
we
have
the
right.
the
state
of
california
has
the
right
to
select
who
shall
be
lawyers
in
the
state
of
california.
and
i
say
that
as
soon
as
you
allow
the
state
of
california
to
select
one
from
another
on
the
basis
that
they
have
tried
to
do
here,
that
is
on
the
basis
of
disagreement
and
basically,
that's
what
they
have
done
here
on
the
basis
of
disagreement
with
the
opinions,
the
ideas
expressed
by
this
petitioner.
this
is
the
basis
--
mr.
edward
mosk
they
have
--
mr.
edward
mosk
i
would
say
that
moral
character
your
honor
does
not
involve
one's
political
views.
mr.
edward
mosk
oh,
yes,
no
question
about
that
and
we
do
not
challenge,
except
as
applied
in
this
case.
and
as
applied
in
this
case,
we
say
it's
arbitrary
a
violation
of
fourteenth
amendment,
but
the
term
moral
character
as
it
has
always
been
interpreted
in
the
past
in
california
up
to
this
case
was
that
if
a
person
had
violated
some
statute,
if
they
had
--
if
the
person
was
--
had
been
involved
in
a
fraud,
the
person
had
fraudulently
made
his
application.
things
in
this
area
are
properly
and
we
do
not
question
their
right
to
term
moral
character
based
on
these
things.
but
what
they
are
doing
now
for
the
first
time
is
saying,
but
moral
character
means
something
else.
we
don't
agree
with
these
articles.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
say
the
majority
of
the
people
don't
agree
with
these
articles
and
that
may
well
be.
but
i
submit
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
majority
of
the
people
in
the
state
do
not
agree
with
one's
ideas
is
not
a
basis
for
saying
that
he
is
not
a
person
of
good
moral
character,
given
the
kind
of
record
that
we
have
here.
and
i
hasten
--
mr.
edward
mosk
i
hasten
to
add
that
because
we
must
approach
this
case
from
the
--
from
the
nature
of
the
record
here.
fortunately,
for
this
petitioner,
he
was
not
in
the
same
position
of
the
ordinary
young
man
of
the
22,
23
or
24
years
old
who
comes
before
the
committee
of
bar
examiners
with
a
--
with
a
clean
slate.
he's
had
no
work
record.
he's
had
no
opportunity
to
establish
a
general
reputation
in
a
record
in
the
community.
but
this
petitioner
was
a
man
of
42
by
the
time
he
arrived
at
where
we
are
today.
and
in
that
basis,
he
had
many
years.
he
had
been
a
social
worker
in
several
cities.
nowhere
in
this
record
is
there
any
challenge
to
the
substantial
reputation
and
record
of
good
moral
character
that
this
man
had
build
up
save
only
the
four
things
that
the
respondent
here
brings
out.
save
only
the
--
their
allegation
of
membership
in
the
communist
party
15
years
earlier.
mr.
edward
mosk
it
was
not,
sir.
that,
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
edward
mosk
as
a
matter
of
fact,
at
that
time
your
honor,
we're
operating
under
the
peak
decision
in
california
which
was
--
was
directly
to
the
contrary.
there
was
a
decision
on
the
state
supreme
court.
mr.
edward
mosk
to
the
effect
that
the
communist
party
was
a
legal
party
in
the
state
of
california.
mr.
edward
mosk
i'm
sorry.
mr.
edward
mosk
they
--
mr.
edward
mosk
of
course
in
1942,
the
communist
party
was
on
the
ballot
in
california.
it
was
perfectly
legal.
there
was
no
challenge
in
that
effect.
it
was
during
the
war
just
before
the
war
years
when
it
was
--
it
was
common
--
it
was
a
common
place
thing
in
california.
this
has
been
indicated
by
the
facts
since
then.
mr.
edward
mosk
oh,
no,
no,
sir.
he
ran
under
democratic
ticket,
and
that
was
many
years
subsequent.
mr.
edward
mosk
there
was
a
communist
--
you
mean
in
the
year
when
he
ran?
mr.
edward
mosk
i
would
doubt
very
much
whether
at
that
time,
although
i'm
not
certain
of
the
fact
on
that.
however,
in
1942,
there's
no
question
if
they
were.
mr.
edward
mosk
not
in
the
state
of
california,
it
has
not,
sir.
mr.
edward
mosk
of
course.
mr.
edward
mosk
but
the
--
the
factual
situation
that
you're
setting
up,
your
honor,
would
have
called
for
the
respondent
to
have
gone
forward
in
some
manner
with
the
evidence.
mr.
edward
mosk
you
see
--
mr.
edward
mosk
i'm
sorry.
mr.
edward
mosk
that's
correct.
and
mrs.
bennett's
testimony
as
far
as
this
record
is
concerned
is
in
effect
a
--
a
shell.
it
says,
you
are
--
he
was
a
member
of
this
group
and
nothing
that
anybody
said
there
was
some
reference
to
all.
well
it
was
implicit
but
of
course
this
is
a
--
is
a
mere
conclusion
of
the
--
of
the
witness
where
she
makes
the
--
the
generality
that
it
was
implicit
that
bad
things
went
on.
mr.
edward
mosk
yes.
i
--
i
say
i'm
aware
that
on
the
--
the
very
first
occasion
in
the
first
colloquy
between
the
committee
and
mr.
konigsberg
at
a
time
when
he
was
there
without
counsel,
if
you
recall
he
had
been
called
in
without
any
knowledge
of
why
he
was
been
there
and
he
was
without
counsel
at
that
time.
however,
even
at
the
same
hearing
and
--
and
still
without
counsel,
i
called
your
honors
attention
on
--
on
page
30
or
starting
right
at
the
bottom
of
29.
i
understand
that
under
the
law
as
it
is
today,
you
may
ask
me
specifically,
“do
i
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence?”
i
specifically
answer,
“i
do
not.
i
never
did
or
never
will.”
when
you
get
into
the
other
question
of
specific
views
in
a
political
party,
it
seems
to
me
only
the
fact
the
right
of
political
opinion
is
protected
under
the
first
amendment
and
is
binding
on
the
states.
and
then
over
on
the
next
page
on
31,
again
the
question,
in
other
words,
you
feel
that
asking
you
that
question
is
a
violation
of
your
constitutional
rights.
answer
“of
free
opinion,
free
speech,
yes.”
and
then
he
goes
on.
so
that
it
is
true
that
--
that
at
the
very
beginning
there
perhaps
was
some
mixture
of
--
of
discussion
about
nameless
informers
and
so
forth.
but
basically,
if
--
if
you
read
the
entire
record,
it's
basic
to
what
he
has
said
that
while
he
did
mixed
in
this
other
argument
in
every
occasion,
he
said
this
is
predicated
on
--
on
the
first
amendment.
and
certainly,
after
the
first
hearing,
there
were
no
other
reference
as
i
think
after
the
first
hearing.
mr.
edward
mosk
132,
sir?
mr.
edward
mosk
oh,
117.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
edward
mosk
that's
correct.
i
think
that
it's
--
it's
simply
a
paraphrase
of
what
he
had
said
before.
but
i
think
that
your
honor
will
find
that
it
was
only
at
the
first
hearing,
the
very
first
hearing
that
these
other
element
of
--
of
nameless
informers
was
intruded
into
it.
and
even
then,
it
was
almost
always
in
juxtaposition
of
saying,
“well,
how
do
i
know
how
many
people
you're
going
to
bring
or
going
to
say
something
else.”
but
in
addition,
in
almost
every
case,
he
said
however
it's
protected
under
the
first
amendment.
so
that
there
is
this
slight
other
element
but
it's
--
it's
only
in
connection
with
the
--
what
he
referred
to
constantly
as
his
first
amendment
position.
mr.
edward
mosk
it
is
--
mr.
edward
mosk
well
--
mr.
edward
mosk
no.
let
me
answer
that
this
way.
the
specific
question
places
a
somewhat
difficult
burden
because
i
say
under
this
record,
we
are
not
challenging
it.
mr.
edward
mosk
no.
mr.
edward
mosk
oh,
well,
obviously,
he's
protected
but
there
still
is
a
burden
and
we
do
not
--
mr.
edward
mosk
he
must
answer
some
questions.
now
--
mr.
edward
mosk
that
is
correct.
that
questions
that
are
pertinent
to
his
moral
--
mr.
edward
mosk
i
would
say
so.
assuming
also,
your
honor,
i
--
i
would
raise
some
question
as
to
the
right
to
simply
go
on
a
fishing
expedition,
because
the
mere
fact
that
the
person
is
coming
before
this
committee
asking
to
be
a
lawyer
--
mr.
edward
mosk
then
he
would
certainly
be
called
upon
to
respond
and
say,
“this
was
not
me
or
if
it
was
me,
here
are
the
circumstances.”
mr.
edward
mosk
it
--
it
would
be
my
opinion,
your
honor
that
if
the
facts
in
this
case
were
otherwise,
and
this
were
the
question
that
was
before
you,
i
would
argue
that
here
again,
we're
in
the
area
of
belief
but
this
would
certainly
be
a
closer
question
that
we
have
here.
i
--
i
would
question
whether
a
question
inquiring
into
his
beliefs
of
this
sort
would
be
a
proper
question.
but
as
i
say,
we're
not
based
with
that
here.
mr.
edward
mosk
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
mosk
his
associations
--
mr.
edward
mosk
if
the
--
if
there
were
--
if
there
were
facts
which
indicated
a
participation
in
some
criminal
activities
then
perhaps
you
could
go
into
this.
but
again,
it's
the
--
it's
the
criminal
activities
that
you're
going
to
and
not
the
association.
mr.
edward
mosk
there
--
yes,
but
i
hastened
again
to
add
that
it
is
the
robbing
of
the
train
that
is
the
important
thing
and
not
the
association.
mr.
edward
mosk
if
having
developed
the
evidence
of
--
of
the
conspiracy
to
rob
the
train
and
there
was
evidence
that
he
was
one
of
the
conspirators
to
rob
the
train
then
perhaps
you
come
over
the
hall
and
say,
“all
right,
well
now,
is
this
you?”
but
in
the
--
in
our
situation,
the
ultimate
question
that
is
the
--
the
wrongdoing
about
the
communist
party,
he
has
already
answered.
and
simply
asking
him
the
question,
“well,
now,
were
you
a
member,”
would
add
them
nothing
because
they
have
to
go
right
back
to
the
other
question
again
unless
they
had
some
additional
evidence
which
obviously
they
did
not
have
and
did
not
come
forward
with.
mr.
edward
mosk
yes,
sir?
mr.
edward
mosk
i'm
not
that
restrictive
in
it.
mr.
edward
mosk
it's
an
easy
way
of
saying
it
but
i
think
it's
not
--
mr.
edward
mosk
no,
it
is
not,
sir,
and
we
do
not
--
we
do
not
for
a
moment
suggest
the
lowering
of
the
standards
of
profession.
mr.
edward
mosk
i
--
i
could
not
answer
that
one
either,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
mosk
yes,
your
--
mr.
edward
mosk
well
--
mr.
edward
mosk
and
i
--
i
perhaps
could
fallback,
your
honor,
on
the
--
on
mr.
konigsberg's
own
answer
in
a
sense
to
that.
mr.
edward
mosk
right.
well,
in
a
sense,
we've
come
to
--
to
part
to
the
vice
in
--
in
having
answered
this
question.
you
see,
mr.
konigsberg
himself
at
a
subsequent
hearing
said,
“i
was
wrong
in
answering
this
question
because
i
realized
that
in
a
sense,
i
have
reached
the
principle
that
i
have
always
lived
in
but
under
the
stress
of
a
hearing,
i
answered
the
question.”
and
i
think
in
a
sense
this
is
the
--
is
the
vice
that
we
have
here.
he
should
not
have
answered
that
question
either
and
it's
only
because
he
did
that
we
get
into
the
position
of
perhaps
having
to
say,
“well,
we
can
prove
the
truth
of
a
belief.”
i
--
i
would
submit
to
your
honor
--
mr.
edward
mosk
that
--
that's
correct
and
i
--
i
would
agree
with
that
100%.
as
a
matter
for
that
--
that
is
the
very
burden
of
our
position
here
that
--
that
we're
not
dealing
with
teachers.
we're
not
dealing
with
--
mr.
edward
mosk
i
--
mr.
edward
mosk
un
--
unfortunately,
your
--
mr.
edward
mosk
well,
unfortunately,
your
honor,
if
this
court
could
replace
them
in
--
in
this
position
with
relation
to
my
case
rather
than
--
than
my
so
stating.
mr.
edward
mosk
no,
but
your
honor,
in
--
in
the
one
case
balancing
off
the
--
the
equities
of
the
situation,
this
court
has
decided
that
there
can
be
certain
--
what
i
would
consider
to
be
intrusions
into
the
--
the
--
mr.
edward
mosk
well
--
mr.
edward
mosk
well,
this
--
this
of
course
is
--
maybe
where
--
where
i
would
somewhat
hard
company
with
your
honor
because
i
--
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
there
is
no
profession
and
this
is
not
to
in
any
way
suggest
that
inquiries
are
necessarily
proper
in
the
case
of
other
professions.
but
i
say
that
if
there
is
anywhere
in
our
society,
if
there
is
any
area
in
our
society
where
we
say
we
must
protect
that
area
against
the
type
of
selection
which
this
respondent
here
has
endeavored
to
make
based
not
on
the
worth
of
the
person,
not
on
a
record
--
mr.
edward
mosk
except
--
mr.
edward
mosk
well,
if
--
if
it
please
the
court,
searching
for
the
truth
telling
on
--
mr.
edward
mosk
true.
mr.
edward
mosk
but
the
question
that
--
that
your
honor
has
asked,
i
don't
believe
that
the
next
questions
would
have
any
way
of
going
to
whether
he
is
telling
the
truth
when
he
says
he's
not
a
philosophical
communist.
this
is
the
vice
with
--
with
inquiry
into
this
area
because
no
one
under
any
circumstances
could
ever
determine
whether
he
was
telling
the
truth.
mr.
edward
mosk
cannot
--
mr.
edward
mosk
i
suppose
there
would
be
questions
of
relevancy
involved,
your
honor,
as
to
whether
it
was
a
relevant
to
the
actual
issues
that
are
involved
here.
but
i
would
be
inclined
to
say
that
if
the
--
that
if
we're
in
an
area
which
bears
no
relationship
other
than
truth
or
falsity
of
an
individual
question,
but
if
that
truth
or
falsity
as
to
the
individual
question
is
going
to
take
us
in
to
determination
with
relation
to
beliefs,
i
would
have
reservations
about
it.
it
--
the
thing
that
i
am
concerned
with
--
mr.
edward
mosk
well,
except
this
that
if
the
entire
area
in
which
they're
dealing
--
mr.
edward
mosk
well,
let
me
--
mr.
edward
mosk
let
me
--
let
me
--
mr.
edward
mosk
let
me
give
an
example
and
by
a
specific
thing
that
we
have
in
this
record.
a
respondent
in
this
record
apparently
recognizing
that
simple
membership
alone
would
not
have
been
sufficient
and
they
--
they
go
back
and
forth
on
this
issue.
on
one
place,
they
say
yes,
another
place
they
say
no,
have
decided
that
they
must
in
some
way
and
this
record
show
that
he
really
does
believe
in
force
and
violence.
so,
in
order
to
establish
this,
they
seek
through
these
articles
that
they've
introduced
and
they've
read
them
through
and
called
them
through.
and
what
did
they
come
up
with
in
order
to
prove
that
this
petitioner
believes
in
force
and
violence,
they
come
up
with
a
statement
that
reads
substantially
like
this.
they
say
petitioner
wrote
in
this
article
that
everyone
should
militantly
defend
the
principles
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
and
then
they
put
in
quite
parenthetically.
they
say,
“militant
means
forceful,
warlike.
therefore,
he
believes
in
force
and
violence.”
now,
this
is
what
happens
as
soon
--
and
by
ways
of
specific
examples
--
this
is
exactly
what
is
going
to
happen
as
soon
as
we
penetrate
into
this
area
of
“what
do
you
think”
and
“what
does
this
article
mean”
and
“who
were
your
associations.”
we'll
come
up
with
this
kind
of
--
of
article
which
they
have
said
now
in
this
record
before
this
court
this
proves
that
this
man
or
it
--
they
don't
say
proofs.
i'm
sorry.
they
say
this
indicates
that
perhaps
he
really
does
believe
in
force
and
violence.
and
this
is
exactly
what
happens
not
only
in
the
articles,
but
it's
also
going
to
happen
as
soon
as
we
start
intruding
into
and
i
--
i
hope
i'm
not
being
too
general,
but
into
the
area
of
what
a
person
thinks
in
the
political
area,
in
the
realm
of
--
of
political
ideas
where
what
this
generation
says
is
correct
and
true
and
--
and
right.
perhaps,
10
years
from
now,
someone
else
will
say
no
and
this
petitioner
can't
wait
10
years
to
be
admitted
to
the
bar.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
case
of
the
--
of
the
applicant
for
admission
to
the
bar,
he
has
established
on
this
record
his
good
moral
character
by
every
standard
which
we
have
known
in
the
past,
save
the
one
that
they
--
that
the
respondent
here
is
endeavoring
to
bring
in
and
that
is
he
has
refused
to
answer
these
couple
of
questions,
these
few
questions
and
sometime
in
the
past
without
more,
he
was,
they
alleged
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
so
that
--
it
seems
to
me
that
what
we
are
dealing
with
this
is
--
is
an
entire
record.
maybe
this
case
would
be
different
if
we
had
a
23-year
old
boy
asked
some
of
these
questions,
i
think
not.
but
we
have
a
record
here
which
is
overwhelming
in
its
proof
of
this
man's
good
moral
character.
every
sign
in
this
record
points
to
his
good
moral
character,
except
these
intrusions
into
this
--
this
area.
and
it
submit
--
it
seems
to
me
that
given
this
record
to
hold
that
this
man
on
the
basis
of
this
--
his
failure
to
answer
these
few
questions
and
this
--
the
other
points
that
they
have
raised,
it
becomes
an
arbitrary
determination
and
contrary
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
i
had
hoped
to
hold
a
few
minutes,
i
think
i
have
about
five
and
i
would
like
at
this
time
to
--
to
reserve
that.
mr.
edward
mosk
if
i
have
--
i
think
i
have
just
a
few
minutes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
mosk
i'd
like
to
address
myself
just
to
few
little
points.
first
of
all,
i
--
i
want
to
indicate
to
the
court
that
i
did
not
purposely
pass
over
the
jurisdictional
point.
i
had
considerable
note
on
them,
but
we
never
quite
got
to
those
points.
and
i'm
satisfied
that
the
record
in
the
briefs
cover
it
except
i
would
like
to
call
to
the
courts
attention
one
point
and
that
is
that
in
respondent's
reply
brief
before
the
california
state
supreme
court
as
indicating
the
complete
recognition
of
the
constitutional
points
aside
from
other
references
in
respondent's
brief
in
their
conclusion,
their
final
summary
to
the
california
supreme
court,
respondent
says
in
part.
in
addition,
respondent
has
shown
its
questions
were
proper
that
petitioner
had
no
constitutional
privilege
justifying
his
refusal
to
answer.
so
that
it's
perfectly
clear,
not
only
from
the
overall
record
and
as
i
indicated
in
further
detail
in
my
brief,
respondents
themselves
recognized
and
presented
before
the
court
the
constitutional
questions
at
all
times
below.
mr.
edward
mosk
yes.
mr.
edward
mosk
yes,
it
is,
sir.
all
of
the
briefs
are
here.
they're
--
we
wrote
some
questions
as
to
what
their
meaning
was
but
they're
all
here
before
you.
mr.
edward
mosk
they're
not
printed
in
the
record
but
the
actual
briefs.
mr.
edward
mosk
there
may
be
more
but
at
least
one
is
here.
i
think
more.
now,
if
i
may
just
briefly
to
try
and
get
to
the
heart
of
some
of
the
comments
that
counsel
--
mr.
edward
mosk
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
mosk
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
mosk
well,
let
--
i
think,
your
honor,
i
have
--
mr.
edward
mosk
yes.
i
--
i'm
aware
of
that
case,
your
honor,
and
it
is
an
isolated
case.
it
deals
with
--
mr.
edward
mosk
right.
but
my
--
my
position
is
very
simple,
your
honor,
that
despite
even
accepting
for
a
moment
the
language
of
that,
i
think
any
examination
of
the
--
of
the
briefs
that
we
have
here
substantiates
the
fact
that
it
was
completely
before
the
court
so
that
i
could
point
to
the
individual
paragraphs,
but
i
think
it
would
do
us
no
good
here.
now,
i
--
i
want
to
--
mr.
edward
mosk
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
your
honor
will
read
our
brief,
i
do
not
think
that
the
brief
cited
really
very
many
cases
on
any
point.
this
was
presenting
a
new
approach
to
the
court
and
there
were
practically
no
cases
cited
as
i
recall.
mr.
edward
mosk
that
might
have
been
an
answer.
[laughs]
however,
i
--
i
think
that
if
your
honors
will
read
the
--
the
record
here,
i
think
that
the
record
will
satisfy
you
that
it
was
at
all
times
before
the
court
and
was
responded
to
by
the
respondents
and
maybe
a
major
part
of
their
response
to
our
position
obviously
indicating
a
complete
recognition
of
the
constitutional
position
that
we
were
putting
forward.
i
also
call
to
the
court's
attention
and
this
was
--
is
only
a
first
step
before
the
california
court
have
they
granted
review,
we
would
then
have
filed
our
actual
briefs
and
arguments
so
that
this
was
a
preliminary
step
before
the
california
court.
but
let
me
address
myself
just
to
the
couple
of
points
that
counsel
has
mentioned
here.
first
of
all,
he
has
said
that
we
failed
to
meet
our
burden
of
proof
and
has
placed
everything
on
this
burden
of
proof.
he
has
avoided
saying
that
it
was
this
--
it
was
the
failure
to
answer
questions
or
it
was
the
communist
party
membership
or
it
was
the
articles
of
the
tenney
committee.
he
has
simply
lump
them
all
together
and
said,
“we
haven't
met
our
burden
of
proof.”
now,
i
want
to
submit
to
the
court
that
this
--
on
this
record,
the
burden
of
proof
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
that
is
we
have
only
--
we
have
not
an
unlimited
burden
of
proof
to
meet.
we
have
a
reasonable
burden
of
proof
to
meet.
they
cannot
place
upon
us
an
unreasonable
burden.
now,
i
submit
that
on
this
record,
where
we
have
shown
affirmatively
our
good
moral
character
beyond
anything
that
any
normal
person
could
do
any
23
or
24-year
old
could
do
while
we've
qualified
educationally
passed
the
bar
exam
affirmatively
in
addition
to
simply
in
language
established
non-belief
in
force
and
violence.
and
i
call
to
your
honors
attention
the
one
article
that
dealt
with
a
relevant
question
under
their
theory.
force
and
violence
was
a
complete
declaration
of
that
people
should
be
punished
to
believe
in
force
and
violence.
mr.
edward
mosk
that
was
one
that
seemed
to
have
been
omitted
in
their
original
offer
which
we
subsequently
in
order
to
make
the
file
clear
did
offer.
and
we
--
we
have
shown
an
affirmation
of
belief
in
democratic
principles
and
the
deviation
on
this
--
this
philosophical
communist
question
only
came
in
the
context
of
saying
if
you
mean
by
a
philosophical
communist,
i
am
a
believer
in
jeffersonian
democracy.
and
in
that
sense,
certainly,
i
am
not
a
philosophical
communist.
this
was
the
context
in
which
this
question
was
answered
going
directly
to
the
force
and
violence
question.
introduced
letters
from
all
walks
of
life
and
--
and
just
to
--
to
point
out
one
of
them
from
professor
niverville
of
the
university
of
southern
california,
one
of
the
people
who
knew
him
last
and
closest
points
out,
“it
was
my
impression
that
mr.
konigsberg
is
a
man
with
the
courage
of
his
convictions
but
not
one
who
holds
those
convictions
blindly
or
with
any
but
the
most
honest
motives.”
he
seems
to
hold
the
constitution
in
high
esteem
and
is
a
vigorous
supporter
of
civil
rights.
but
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
despite
his
vigorous
position,
he
showed
a
willingness
to
recognize
the
necessity
from
time
to
time
of
balancing
the
interest
of
the
individual
against
the
interest
of
society
and
so
forth.
so
that
when
counsel
says,
“the
letters
did
not
go
to
the
heart
of
the
issue,”
these
letters
did
go
to
the
heart
of
the
issue
and
we
offered
to
bring
these
people
before
the
committee
and
let
them
cross-examine
them
on
the
heart,
but
the
committee
never
availed
itself
of
that
opportunity.
now,
--
mr.
edward
mosk
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
mosk
i'm
generally
familiar
with
it.
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
mosk
yes,
yes.
mr.
edward
mosk
on
the
factual
basis,
your
honor?
mr.
edward
mosk
i
would
not
--
the
facts
would
not
be
that
close,
your
honor
that
i
would
want
to
comment
on
it
from
that
point
of
view.
i
--
i
would
like
to
refer
to
the
other
cases
of
the
counsel
cited
and
the
adler
case
for
instance
where
counsel
used
this
to
say
and
pointed
out
that
it
involved
the
right
to
work
in
a
school
system
and
i
submit
that
right
there,
we've
come
to
the
crux
of
the
difference
and
it
is
certainly
not
my
position
that
there
--
that
there
is
such
a
great
difference
between
education
and
the
law
and
i
don't
want
to
be
placed
in
that
position.
but
nevertheless,
this
case
was
at
least
in
part
based
upon
the
fact
that
here
were
employees,
employees
of
a
school
system.
but
when
we
are
dealing
with
the
legal
profession,
we
are
not
dealing
with
employees
of
the
state.
the
lawyer
is
not
an
employee
of
the
state.
he
is
an
independent
person
and
the
very
independence
of
the
lawyer
is
the
reason
why
the
kind
of
encroachment
which
the
respondent
here
is
endeavoring
to
make
is
going
to
destroy
that
very
independence
of
the
bar.
because
if
they
are
entitled
to
ask
this
kind
of
a
question,
what
would
prevent
for
instance
the
supreme
court
of
--
or
the
committee
of
bar
examiners
say
in
alabama
from
saying,
“are
you
a
member
of
the
naacp,”
knowing
that
so
far
alabama
is
concerned,
the
naacp
believes
in
overthrowing
the
--
the
kind
of
--
of
status
of
the
government
there.
and
i
submit
that
you
cannot
make
this
kind
of
an
encroachment
in
the
case
of
a
legal
profession
and
still
maintain
the
kind
of
standards
and
high
moral
principle
that
the
legal
profession
includes.
i
would
like
to
and
i
have
not
the
time
to
do
it
now,
call
to
the
court's
attention
the
questionnaire
which
respondent
themselves
sent
out
to
petitioners
here
and
see
whether
they
included
themselves
within
that
good
moral
character
of
these
political
questions.
they
asked
the
--
every
petitioner
certain
questions
in
a
questionnaire
which
is
included
in
the
record
here
at
page
262.
and
in
this,
they
went
directly
to
the
type
of
thing
which
has
always
been
good
moral
character
in
the
past.
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
what
they
have
asked
him
to
do,
the
petitioner
here
to
do
is
to
give
up
his
good
moral
character,
his
principles
in
order
to
become
a
man
of
good
moral
character.
and
i
submit
that
this
is
improper
and
the
petitioner
should
be
allowed
to
be
a
member
of
the
bar.
