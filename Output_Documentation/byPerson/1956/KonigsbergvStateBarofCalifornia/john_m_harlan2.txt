justice
john
m.

didn't
he
also
say
the
he
was
worried
about
being
prosecuted
for
perjury?

94
and

of
the
record.
justice
john
m.
harlan
they're
not
bound
by
his
answer.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
this
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
premise
of
your
position
is
that
he
answered
the
question
as
to
whether
he
was
a
communist
or
in
a
philosophical
sense
and
he
said
no.
now,
supposing
he'd
answered
this
question
as
to
whether
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
his
answer
to
it
showed
that
he
was
an
officer
of
the
communist
party
and
a
member
of
it,
and
that
he
had
not
stated
truth
to
the
committee
when
he
had
first
--
when
he
had
first
said
that
he
was
not
a
philosophical
communist.
could
the
committee
take
that
into
account
as
a
reason
for
not
admitting
him?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
they've
put
on

justice
john
m.
harlan
they've
put
on
mrs.
bennett.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
i'm
puzzled
about
is
whether
he
said
at
page
38,
mr.
sterling,
a
member
of
the
committee.
this
is
all
in
relation
as
to
why
he
balks
at
answering
the
question,
“are
you
a
member
of
the
communist
party?”
and
mr.
sterling
asked,
“if
you
are
afraid
if
you
answer
the
question
as
to
membership
in
the
communist
party
the
negative
and
say,
“no,
i
am
not
a
member
and
i
have
never
been.”
assuming
you
made
that
answer,
you
were
afraid
that
we
could
find
half
a
dozen
people
who
would
say
that
you
were
--
were
and
have
been
and
therefore
you
were
--
if
you
were
on
a
perjury
trial
and
the
jury
believed
them
and
not
you,
you've
committed
perjury.
and
his
answer
was,
“i'm
saying
no
matter
what
answer
i
have,
whether
i
was
or
wasn't
then,
definitely,
there
would
be
several
whom
you
could
get
to
say
the
opposite
and
as
i
said
before.”
then
mr.
sterling
and
the
judge
subjecting
him
to
a
perjury
trial
and
the
witness
answer
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
how
about
this,
on
page
117,
which
is
the
second
hearing?
mr.
frodo
is
a
member
of
the
committee.
you
refused
to
affirm
or
deny
our
testimony.
that's
the
testimony
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
117.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
under
the
page,
“mr.
frodo,
you
refused
to
affirm
or
deny
our
testimony,”
that
means
mrs.
bennett's
testimony.
mr.
konigsberg,
“the
committee
is
not
empowered
to
ask
with
regard
to
political
affiliations
to
that
type.”
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
brief
on
our
files?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
was
any
of
that,
is
it
--
is
it
--
is
it
available
to
us?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question
at
that
point?
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
you
didn't
have
in
this
record
his
refusal
to
answer
questions,
is
it
your
position
that
any
of
that
material
that
you've
read
would
have
justified
it
being
kept
out
of
the
bar?
justice
john
m.
harlan
then,
why
refer
to
it?
