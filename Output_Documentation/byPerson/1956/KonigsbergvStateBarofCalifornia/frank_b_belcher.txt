mr.
frank
b.
belcher
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
order
of
this
court
granting
certiorari
which
appears
at
page
133
of
the
record,
the
court
directed
to
counsel
three
questions
touching
upon
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
to
hear
this
matter
and
asked
that
we
comment
upon
them
not
only
in
briefs
but
in
oral
argument.
paraphrasing
these
questions,
the
first
were,
were
petitioners
constitutional
claims
raised
before
the
supreme
court
of
california?
the
second
question
was,
was
the
supreme
court
of
california's
denial
of
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
review,
a
final
judgment
within
the
meaning
of
28
u.s.
code
1257?
and
the
third
question
was,
if
a
final
question,
was
it
a
rejection
of
petitioner's
claims
under
the
fourteenth
amendment?
answering
those
questions,
i
would
say
that
in
my
judgment,
the
answer
to
the
second
question
is
yes,
that
the
rejection
by
the
supreme
court
of
california
of
this
petition
for
a
writ
of
review
was
a
final
judgment
sufficient
for
the
purpose
of
giving
this
court
jurisdiction
in
that
respect.
answering
however
the
first
and
the
third
questions,
my
answer
to
this
court
is
no
to
each
of
them.
i
hold
here
petitioner's
plea
which
was
filed
before
the
supreme
court
of
california.
and
i
say
to
this
court
that
there
is
not
one
heading,
one
paragraph,
one
sentence
or
one
phrase
or
a
single
authority
which
raises
the
constitutional
questions
before
the
supreme
court
of
california
which
they
attempt
to
place
before
this
court.
it
has
then
a
rule
--
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
it
was
--
this
situation
exist
mr.
justice
with
reference
to
the
brief.
yes,
sir.
it
was
certified
to
this
court
by
the
supreme
court
of
california.
a
request
was
made
by
the
petitioner
here
that
it
be
included
in
the
record.
it
however
was
not
so
included,
but
we
have
been
advised
by
the
clerk.
i
assume
the
court
is
not
necessarily
bound
by
the
clerk
that
we
have
the
right
to
advert
to
it
in
argument.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
yes,
sir.
it
is
on
file
here.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
it's
certified
here
by
the
supreme
court
of
california.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
i
say
sir
that
he
did
not
raise
the
questions
in
the
brief.
now,
they
were
specified
in
the
petition
as
such.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
the
petition
sets
them
forth
pro
forma,
yes
sir,
but
there
is
not
one
--
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
they
are
merely
recited
as
one
of
the
grounds
upon
which
they
are
petitioning
for
a
writ
of
review.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
the
petition
is
something
--
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
because
our
court
has
held
and
has
held
many,
many
times
that
points
which
are
not
argued
in
the
brief
do
not
have
to
be
considered
by
the
court
and
are
deemed
waived.
that
--
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
yes,
sir.
now,
in
count
--
in
the
brief
of
the
--
the
counsel
for
petitioner,
he
says
that
that
rule
only
apply
in
cases
of
appeal
and
not
in
cases
where
the
supreme
court
of
california
has
the
original
jurisdiction.
but
in
making
that
statement,
he
overlooks
the
case
of
johnson
against
state
bar
in
our
4
cal.2d
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
which
was
a
petition
for
review
addressed
to
the
state
bar
of
california
before
the
supreme
court
of
california
and
in
which
they
attempted
to
raise
a
constitutional
question.
and
in
that
case,
the
supreme
court
of
california
again
said
that
if
you
don't
raise
these
questions
in
your
brief,
if
you
don't
argue
and
if
you
don't
cite
available
authorities,
then
we
do
not
have
to
know
this.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
in
the
johnson
case?
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
that
sir
i
cannot
answer
because
they
denied
it
without
opinion.
they
denied
it
by
a
4-to-3
vote.
however,
i
do
not
think
that
the
three
negative
votes
should
be
construed
as
a
favor
of
granting
a
petition.
i
think
it
was
possibly
because
they
thought
an
opinion
should
be
written.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
i
didn't
understand
your
question,
sir.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
no,
sir,
because
they
did
not
tender
it.
the
state
bar
did
--
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
yes,
but
not
argued
in
the
pleas
and
the
state
bar
only
paid
attention
to
the
matters
which
were
raised
in
the
brief.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
all
right,
sir.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
paragraph
--
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
i
could
do
that
perfectly
by
quoting
his
topical
index,
point
4.
applicant
has
sustained
his
burden
of
proof
and
established
his
good
moral
character,
(a)
petitioner
fulfilled
all
requirements
of
the
committee,
(b)
the
applicant
established
by
letter
and
other
documentary
proof
his
good
moral
character,
(c)
the
record
contains
no
evidence
of
bad
moral
character
within
the
meaning
of
section
6060
(c),
(d)
the
respondent
cannot
base
its
denial
of
admission
upon
the
fact
that
this
petitioner
declined
to
answer
certain
questions.
point
5,
the
applicant
does
not
believe
in
force
and
violence,
(a)
the
committee
heard
in
placing
the
burden
of
proof
upon
the
applicant
to
show
compliance
within
the
provision
of
section
6064.1
and,
(b)
the
applicant
affirmatively
established
his
antipathy
to
the
doctrine
of
force
and
violence.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
(d)
the
respondent
cannot
base
its
denial
of
admission
upon
the
fact
that
this
petitioner
declined
to
answer
questions.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
no,
sir.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
yes,
sir.
and
there
was
--
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
not
in
petitioner's
brief.
that
is
what
i
am
referring
to.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
and
the
supreme
--
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
yes,
but
it
has
been
repeatedly
held
by
our
supreme
court
time
without
number.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
that
it
has
to
be
raised
initially
or
it
has
been
deemed
waived.
and
i
submit
that
--
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
no,
sir
and
that
rule
also
is
that
it
applies
in
a
case
of
this
kind
which
has
taken
initially
to
the
supreme
court
in
johnson
against
the
state
bar
is
the
case
which
we
cite
is
so
old.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
yes,
sir,
and
has
--
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
may
i
inquire
what
brief
you
were
--
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
before
this
court
--
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
--
on
page
--
on
page
5.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
yes,
sir.
that
is
a
correct
quotation
--
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
--
which
is
in
his
brief
purely
by
way
of
recital.
again,
i
say
without
one
word
of
argument
and
without
a
single
constitutional
authority
of
any
kind
or
character
and
nature.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
no,
but
it
say
you
must
at
least
raise
the
point,
argue
it
and
cite
available
authorities.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
well,
there
happens
to
be
a
wealth
of
them
in
this
instance,
sir,
by
this
court,
the
sights
of
--
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
where
the
rule
is
that
you've
got
to
argue
it
and
cite
available
authorities.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
yes.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
yes,
but
the
johnson
case
your
honor,
and
the
language
in
that
decision
relates
to
the
briefs
which
were
filed
in.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
well,
frankly,
i
can't
say
as
to
the
requirements
but
i
know
that
it
was
always
the
practice
in
these
matters
to
submit
a
brief
with
your
application.
now,
it
is
true
that
for
many
years,
the
court
out
there
entertained
very
informal
petitions
that
did
not
have
to
be
much
more
than
a
letter
simply
stating
if
we
want
the
court
to
review
this.
but
i
have
known
of
no
relaxation
in
the
requirements
of
that
court
so
far
as
the
briefing
is
concerned.
i
place
that
court
--
that
points
simply
before
the
court
because
we
were
directed
to
argument.
now,
the
petitioner
in
his
briefs
and
in
his
arguments
before
this
court
here
has
sought
to
show
that
this
petitioner
was
denied
admission
or
certification
for
admission
in
california
because
of
his
political,
economic
and
social
beliefs.
i
say
to
this
court
with
all
the
conviction
that
i
can
muster
that
i
think
there
is
no
foundation
for
that
statement
at
all.
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
denied
certification
to
the
supreme
court
because
he
failed
to
establish
his
good
moral
character
and
because
he
left
some
considerable
doubt
as
to
how
he
stood
on
the
matter
of
the
use
of
force
and
violence
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government.
now,
we
have
a
specific
statute
on
that
score
that
no
one
maybe
certified
for
evasion
to
practice
law
who
advocates
the
overthrow
of
either
the
federal
or
the
state
government
by
force
and
violence
or
other
constitutional
means.
that
is
the
way
the
matter
became
a
subject
of
inquiry
before
our
board
of
bar
examiners.
now,
the
board
of
bar
examiners
made
two
findings
and
one
of
them
was
that
this
petitioner
had
not
sustained
the
burden
of
proof
as
to
his
good
moral
character
and
that
he
had
not
let
the
statutory
test
--
test
of
being
one
who
could
not
advocate
the
overthrow
of
--
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
and
there
was
no
finding
that
he
was
denied
admission
because
of
any
of
his
social,
economic
or
political
beliefs.
now,
by
statute,
it
became
the
duty
of
the
board
of
bar
governors
to
make
inquiry
into
these
things,
and
that
is
exactly
what
they
did
in
discharge
of
their
duty.
now,
the
report
passes
of
evidence
in
all
which
were
introduced
into
that
hearing.
the
first
one
had
to
deal
with
a
transcript
of
a
hearing
in
which
this
petitioner
appeared
before
the
so-called
tenney
committee
which
was
a
legislative
un-american
activities
committee
in
the
state
of
california.
now,
at
the
time
he
appeared
before
that
committee
as
shown
by
transcript
of
the
proceedings,
he
was
asked
and
i
quote.
"have
you
ever
been
or
are
you
now
a
member
of
the
communist
party?"
now,
mr.
--
although
he
was
directed
three
times
in
his
appearance
before
the
tenney
committee
to
answer
that
question,
he
never
did
so.
and
his
answer
was
a
long
two
or
three-page
garbled
reply,
the
summoned
substance
of
which
was
that
he
declined
to
answer
the
question.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
that
he
refused
to
answer
the
question.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
not
standing
alone,
sir,
but
we
say
that
that
is
a
very
significant
indicia
as
bearing
upon
his
good
moral
character
or
lack
of
it.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
he
never
adopted
the
fifth
amendment
specifically
declined
to
do
so.
always
upon
the
first
amendment,
that
he
had
a
right
to
his
religious,
political
and
personal
beliefs
and
that
we
had
no
right
to
inquire
into
them.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
that
the
committee
has
no
right
to
inquire
into
them,
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
absolutely,
without
the
slightest
question
and
this
court
is
so
held
as
i
shall
presently
point
out.
now,
the
next
bit
of
evidence
was
the
testimony
of
this
mrs.
bennett
which
has
been
referred
to.
now,
mrs.
bennett's
testimony
left
much
to
be
desired
that
i
can
see
her
identification
of
this
man
was
not
all
that
you
might
wish.
but
in
the
course
of
her
testimony,
she
testified
that
it
is
implicit
in
the
fact
that
one
who
is
a
communist
that
one
expected
a
forceful
overthrow
of
the
government
at
some
time.
now,
this
respondent
was
present
when
mrs.
bennett
testified,
and
later
on,
when
he
was
on
the
stand
he
was
asked
by
a
member
of
the
committee
as
follows
and
i'm
now
referring
to
page
117
of
the
brief
of
the
record.
“who?
a
lady
by
the
name
of
bennett
testified
here.
you
heard
her
testimony.
is
there
any
part
of
that
testimony
you
wish
to
desire
to
deny?”
mr.
konigsberg
replied
in
part.
“that
is
a
question
relating
to
opinions,
beliefs,
political
affiliations.”
and
again,
he
said,
“the
committee
is
not
empowered
to
ask
with
regard
to
political
affiliations
of
that
type.”
and
in
short,
he
may
--
he
declined
to
make
any
more
specific
answer
but
no
place,
even
no
given
repeated
opportunities
so
to
do
that
he
ever
denied
one
word
of
what
mrs.
bennett
had
testified
to.
now,
in
addition
to
that,
they
were
introduced
into
the
record
here
as
counsel
for
petitioner
has
indicated
some
27
articles
which
the
petitioner
had
written
for
this
newspaper
called,
the
eagle.
the
petitioner
himself
later
put
in
some
51
articles
which
as
i
recall
included
the
27,
which
the
committee
had
introduced.
now,
i'm
going
to
refer
to
certain
excerpts
from
those
articles,
not
as
an
infringement
upon
this
man's
freedom
of
the
press
or
freedom
of
speech
but
for
the
purpose
of
showing
certain
characteristics
in
his
line
of
thinking
which
furnished
that
i
submit
a
reasonable
foundation
for
later
inquiry
by
the
members
of
this
bar
examining
committee.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
1900,
from
july
the
28th
of
1950
to
december
of
1950,
so
far
as
the
27
put
in
by
the
committee
but
extending
over
until
may.
i
believe
it
was
of
1951
by
--
by
the
petitioner
himself.
now,
i
expect
--
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
1950
to
1951.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
no,
that
was
--
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
yes,
sir.
now,
i
expect
to
show
by
these
articles
a
general
trend
along
this
line.one
of
the
extreme
criticism
of
the
government
all
the
way
from
the
local
school
board,
the
local
council
to
the
highest
offices
in
washington,
the
second
trend
is
an
extreme
sympathy
--
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
has
a
right
to
do
it.
no
question
about
it
and
i
concede
it.
the
second
trend
in
these
articles
which
he
wrote
shows
his
extreme
sympathy
with
everyone
who
has
some
leaning
towards
the
communist
doctrine
and
particularly
with
the
soviet
union
and
things
that
they
do.
for
instance,
he
wrote,
“on
freedom
side
or
such
good
people
as
a
hollywood
ten,
the
(inaudible),
the
members
of
progressive
party,
the
joint
anti-fascist
refugee
committee,
the
paul
robeson's
and
the
howard
fast's.
on
the
other
side
are
the
giant
corporations,
the
mac
arthur's,
the
truman's,
the
mason's,
the
american
legion,
the
chamber
of
commerce
and
practically
all
press,
radio
and
movies.”
again,
he
says,
“a
school
system
that
is
so
deeply
committed
to
the
anti
--
anti-democratic
conspiracies
being
enjoyed
by
the
economic
loyalists
to
whom
they
have
sold
out.
i
criticize
the
boards
of
education,
the
board
of
supervisors,
the
sheriff,
the
city
council.”
he
called
our
defense
forces
a
scoff
army
and
he
spoke
up
and
again
i
quote,
“sons
slaughtered
on
foreign
fields
to
ensure
greater
profits
for
the
morgan's
and
the
mac
arthur's.”
he
was
severely
critical
of
the
secretary
of
state,
the
attorney
general,
called
the
president
dishonest,
spoke
of
him
as
hydrogen
harry
and
referred
to
and
again
i
quote,
"his
program
for
war
and
american
fascism
which
taft
and
his
collaborators
are
helping
truman
and
his
cronies
to
fasten
on
america."
he
wrote
quote
--
and
quoting
again,
“the
nationalist
theory
and
terror
over
communism,
manufactured
by
the
taft-truman
axis
to
divide
and
deceive
the
american
people.”
again,
he
also
wrote
of
the
intellectual
dishonesty
of
certain
senators
and
he
spoke
to
the
leaders
of
our
land
as
and
again
i
quote,
"men
without
principles,
without
morals
and
without
hopes."
he
wrote
of
american
imperialism
and
he
also
wrote
and
again
i
quote,
"the
obscene
cry
of
fighting
communism."
he
charged
the
united
states
of
these
articles
with
aggression
in
korea.
he
demanded
that
we
take
our
troops
out
of
korea.
he
advocated
joining
the
soviet
union
in
rebuilding
a
democratic
united
nations
and
world
peace.
he
wrote
critically
of
the
building
of
strings
of
bases
around
the
soviet
republic
and
he
charged
the
united
states
of
provoking
china
and
with
aggression
in
korea.
he
charged
the
united
states
with
war
against
the
people
of
korea
and
spoke
of
it
as
being
a
criminal
war.
he
bemoaned
and
again
i
quote,
“the
jailing
of
the
leaders
of
the
communist
party.”
he
charged
our
government
who
are
trying
the
outlaw
peace
but
he
praised
the
soviets
as
being
the
true
promoters
of
peace.
he
advocated
the
withdrawal
of
our
forces
from
korea,
of
canceling
the
martial
plan,
of
withdrawing
that
from
the
north
atlantic
pact
and
he
urged
recognition
and
establishment
of
trade
relations
with
red
china
and
with
their
admissions
to
the
--
the
united
nations.
he
also
charged
the
leaders
of
our
land
with
and
again
i
quote,
"treasonous
betrayals
of
our
political
code."
he
charged
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
that
sold
out
to
its
enemies
and
that
again
i
quote,
"judges
with
impunity
violate
our
constitutional
rights."
he
even
charged
the
vatican
and
the
pope
with
duplicity
and
conspiring
to
help
hitler
launch
world
war
ii
and
he
blasted
all
persons
who
criticized
russia.
he
charged
the
american
people
with
permitting
the
government
to
make
war
on
the
people
of
greece,
china
and
korea
and
predicted
that
in
time,
the
government
might
make
war
even
upon
its
own
people.
now,
before
going
i
think
--
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
no,
sir.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
because
i
say
that
it
furnished
the
court
of
appeal
for
cross-examination
of
this
man
an
inquiry
into
some
of
his
beliefs
and
associations
which
he
consistently
defined
to
give
the
committee
the
right
to
do.
now,
i
want
to
again
make
it
clear,
exceedingly
clear
that
i
recognize
the
man's
right
to
write
and
speak
as
he
has
done.
but
i
want
to
make
it
equally
clear
that
i
think
that
the
committee
of
bar
examiners
of
california
not
only
had
the
right
but
that
they
had
the
duty
with
those
utterances
coming
from
him
to
ask
concerning
some
of
his
beliefs
with
reference
to
the
forceful
overthrow
of
the
government
or
the
use
of
other
unconstitutional
means.
now,
the
committee
did
attempt
to
question
mr.
konigsberg
with
respect
to
these
articles
but
without
much
success.
for
example,
when
they
asked
him
if
certain
statements
written
by
him
was
a
true
statement,
he
replied
in
substance
that
when
a
person
writes
as
a
newspaperman,
freedom
of
the
press
and
freedom
of
the
speech
are
involved,
"regardless
of
truth
or
falsity.”
and
argued
that
by
reason
of
the
first
amendment,
he
was
not
required
to
answer
as
to
whether
he
now
took
the
same
position.
when
asked
again
further
as
to
some
of
his
present
beliefs,
he
answered
and
stated
and
again
i
quote
him,
"i
believe
that
what
i
believe
today
has
no
bearing
on
my
moral
fitness
to
practice
law."
now,
he
persisted
in
that
position
time
and
time
again
even
though
this
committee
advised
him
that
all
it
was
trying
to
do
was
to
test
his
veracity.
now,
the
following
transport
--
transpired
in
front
of
this
committee
by
mr.
fuller,
a
member
of
the
committee,
quote,
"to
return
to
the
editorial
entitled,
court
of
last
resort,
dated
may
the
11th
of
1950,
there
is
this
language.
when
the
supreme
court
of
these
benighted
states
can
refuse
to
review
the
case
of
the
hollywood
ten,
thus
making
that
high
tribunal
an
integral
part
of
the
cold
war
machine
directed
against
the
american
people,
then
the
enemies
of
democracy
have
indeed
won
a
major
victory.
when
the
commanders
of
the
last
legal
bulwark
of
our
liberties
sell
out
to
the
enemy,
then
the
fascists
have
gone
far,
much
further
than
most
people
think.
he
who
cannot
see
the
dangerous
damnable
parallel
to
what
happened
in
germany
is
willfully
blind."
he
questioned,
“you
made
that
statement?”
mr.
konigsberg
-
“if
that
is
a
correct
copy
of
what
i
wrote,
i
made
the
statement
at
that
time,
yes.
mr.
fuller
-
“and
would
you
make
that
statement
today?”
mr.
konigsberg
-
“again,
i
give
you
the
answer
that
because
of
the
guarantees
of
the
freedom
of
speech,
the
freedom
of
the
press
under
the
first
amendment,
the
committee
has
not
empowered
into
--
to
inquire
into
what
i
think
or
say
today.”
mr.
fuller
-
“have
you
any
evidence
to
support
your
statement
at
the
supreme
court
sold
out
to
the
enemy?”
mr.
konigsberg
-
“i
think
i
covered
that
in
what
i
said
in
answer
to
your
previous
question.”
mr.
fuller
-
“i
don't
believe
it
is
in
the
evidence
to
support
that
statement.”
mr.
konigsberg
-
“are
you
asking
me
if
i
have
any
evidence
now?”
mr.
fuller
-
“did
you
have
any
evidence
then?”
mr.
konigsberg
-
“i
think
the
same
answer
applies.”
mr.
fuller
-
“what
is
the
answer?”
mr.
konigsberg
-
“the
committee
is
not
empowered
to
ask
me
questions
relating
to
what
i
thought
or
opinions
which
i
express.”
now,
the
committee
also
asked
this
petitioner,
quote,
"mr.
konigsberg,
are
you
a
communist?"
now,
his
answer
to
that
was
long
and
in
bulk
but
in
substance
it
was
that
he
did
not
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
or
violence
that
whether
he
was
or
wasn't
a
communist,
the
committee
would
get
a
dozen
informers
who
would
say
the
opposite
and
that
his
right
of
political
opinion
is
protected
under
the
first
amendment,
but
he
didn't
answer
the
question.
pages
37,
38
and
39
of
the
record,
the
same
question
was
put
to
him
and
he
took
the
same
attitude.
when
he
was
asked
if
he
had
knowingly
participated
in
any
organization
which
he
believe
was
sympathetic
to
the
communist
cause,
his
answer
in
substance
was
that
it
wouldn't
have
made
any
difference
to
him
one
way
or
the
other,
so
long
as
the
organization
had
other
proper
objectives.
and
he
declined
again
on
page
40
of
the
record
to
say
whether
he
was
or
was
not
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
on
page
118
of
the
record,
he
was
asked.
“are
you
a
member
of
the
communist
party
now?”
to
which
he
made
this
reply
“the
answer
is
the
same
i
would
give.
the
committee
is
not
empowered
any
more
than
they
may
inquire
whether
i'm
an
elk,
a
freemason,
a
democrat
or
a
republican.
it
might
be
incriminating
to
be
a
member
of
the
democratic
party
today,
like
saying
all
democrats
are
traitors.
now,
he
was
advised
by
this
committee
that
the
committee
was
interested
in
knowing
whether
or
not
he
had
any
past
or
present
affiliations
with
the
communist
party.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
no,
sir.
he
was
denied
admission
on
the
ground
that
he
is
--
had
not
established
his
good
moral
character
and
the
director
did
not
establish
that
he
--
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
well,
i
was
not
a
member
of
the
committee,
but
undoubtedly,
the
committee
did
and
had
a
right
to
take
into
consideration
his
refusal
to
answer
those
questions.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
i
think
they
furnished
the
committee
with
a
right
of
cross-examination
which
he
denied.
standing
alone
on
the
articles,
i
would
say
would
--
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
well,
i'm
not
entirely
certain
that
i
understand
just
what
definition
you're
placed
--
placing
upon
good
moral
character.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
showing
in
this
record
that
the
man
was
ever
--
that
he
had
ever
robbed
a
bank,
that
he
had
ever
stolen
money
from
anybody
or
that
he
--
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
there's
evidence
here
that
he
attended
communist
party
meetings.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
not,
basically
--
not
beyond
what
i
have
indicated
to
the
court
and
what
i
am
going
to
indicate
in
just
a
few
further
reference.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
and
his
own
appearance
that
attitude
and
his
answers
before
the
committee.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
under
our
decision,
sir,
there
is
no
question
of
that.
that
any
petitioner
must
assume
the
burden
it
has
been
declared
many
times
by
our
supreme
court
and
so
far
as
my
research
has
disclosed
as
a
universal
rule
throughout
all
states
in
the
united
state.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
of
his
good
moral
character?
by
bringing
in
proper
evidence
of
that
by
undergoing
questioning
--
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
he
brought
in
some
40
letters
from
various
people.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
he
was
told
that
it
would
not
be
necessary
that
the
committee
would
--
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
on
the
contrary,
they
all
let
them
had
the
very
glowing
statements
as
to
the
man's
record
although
none
of
those
record,
none
of
those
letters
gave
any
evidence
of
any
knowledge
of
his
having
been
or
having
attended
meetings
of
the
communist
party
or
of
any
of
this
writing.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
no,
sir.
i
think
he
was
not
of
good
moral
character.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
because
i
think
any
man
who
comes
before
the
bar
seeking
to
be
admitted
to
practice
law
or
to
answer
with
frankness
questions
concerning
his
past
associations
and
beliefs
and
so
on,
particularly
when
they
involved
his
attitude
towards
the
government
and
particularly
when
they
involved
his
attitudes
towards
the
courts
from
the
lowest
to
the
highest
in
the
land.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
well,
that's
the
major
portion
of
it,
sir.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
well,
i
don't
think
that
he
has
sustained
the
burden
here
at
all
by
showing
that
he
would
not
advocate
force
and
violence
against
the
government.
and
that
he's
extolling
members
of
the
communist
party
of
russia
and
that
those
who
have
been
sympathetic
with
the
communist
party
raised
a
very,
very
severe
doubt
in
that
regard.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
no,
sir
as
such.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
well,
no.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
not
if
the
--
not
if
he
had
the
--
not
if
he
otherwise
resist,
now
with
your
question,
one
with
that
disbarring.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
no,
sir.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
well,
now,
your
honor
says
you'd
mean
--
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
no,
sir.
there
is
not.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
not,
as
a
matter
--
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
as
a
--
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
answering
your
question
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
answer
would
be
no,
whether
or
not
it
might
disbar
him
as
a
matter
of
fact
upon
a
factual
determination
by
the
committee
presents
another
question
which
is
in
--
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
well,
of
course,
that's
extremely
hypothetical,
your
honor.
and
i've
--
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
i've
missed
--
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
well,
now,
if
you
take
judicial
notice
that
the
member
--
that
the
communist
party
is
a
continuing
conspiracy
to
overthrow
government
by
force
and
violence
as
has
been
legislatively
found
and
has
been
judicially
found
then
my
answer
to
your
question
would
be
yes.
however,
the
precise
question
which
you
are
now
posing
to
me,
will
doctors
be
debated
at
length
in
the
next
case
which
follows
this
when
upon
your
calendar
were
almost
that
precise
situation
existed.
now,
to
pursue
on
--
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
yes?
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
that's
very
good
summary
of
it,
sir,
yes,
sir.
except
i
want
to
go
if
i
may
just
one
step
further
in
showing
just
how
far
is
declination
to
answer
questions
went.
on
page
109,
he
said,
“i
really
say
that
you
are
not
entitled
to
know
my
associations
and
any
person
may
refuse
to
answer
on
the
basis
of
the
rights
of
a
citizen
under
the
first
amendment
to
which
i
have
previously
referred
to
on
my
testimony.”
again,
he
said,
“as
to
whether
i
still
believe
this
or
not,
then
i
think
you're
venturing
in
to
the
realm
of
belief
again.”
i
don't
refuse
to
answer.
it
was
always
the
position
he
took
but
i
say
under
the
basis
of
my
rights
under
the
first
amendment,
i'm
not
required
to
answer.
again,
he
stated
his
position
next,
“you
are
empowered
to
ask.
do
i
personally
advocate
the
overthrow
by
--
the
overthrow
by
force
or
violence
or
other
unconstitutional
means,
and
at
the
time
i
say,
no,
you
can't
ask
any
further
political
questions.”
again,
he
said
on
page
125,
“the
committee
can
only
ask.
do
you
now
personally
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
or
this
state
by
force
or
violence
or
other
unconstitutional
means,
and
if
i
say
no,
yes
or
whatever
it
may
be,
that
is
as
far
as
you
can
go.”
and
again,
i
am
saying
they
can
only
ask,
“do
i
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
or
violence
or
other
means?”
and
in
substance,
he
specifically
stated
and
declined
to
give
to
this
committee
any
right
of
cross-examination
whatsoever
on
his
declaration
as
to
his
attitude
about
the
use
of
force.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
it
is
a
--
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
regretfully,
i
cannot
agree
with
your
honor,
that
it
must
be
one
or
the
other.
i
say
when
the
testimony
of
mrs.
bennett
and
the
man's
declaration
raised
a
strong
suspicion
or
even
an
inference
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
that
he
may
have
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
yesterday
or
the
day
before
and
that
being
so
at
least
the
suspicion
or
inference
of
his
sympathy
with
the
use
of
force
and
violence
arose
that
in
order
to
--
and
having
in
mind
the
record
of
deceit
and
treachery
of
that
party,
that
the
obligation
then
involved
upon
him
to
answer
with
the
utmost
freedom
and
frankness
before
that
committee
exactly
what
his
attitude
was.
but
when
he
simply
took
the
position
that
i
say
today,
today
and
he
limited
it
right
down
today
that
i
do
not
advocate
the
use
of
force
and
violence
and
then
declined
all
the
right
to
cross-examination.
or
to
prove
him
in
the
slightest
extent
in
that
regard
that
the
man
just
simply
failed
to
meet
the
test
to
proving
his
good
moral
character
and
failed
to
remove
the
suspicion
or
inferences
to
what
his
attitude
might
be
with
respect
to
force
and
violence.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
will
you
couple
with
that
his
refusal
to
answer
any
question
--
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
all
right.
i'll
--
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
all
right.
i'll
say
no
to
your
--
i'll
say
no
to
this
question
drawing
that
1943
line
and
just
nothing
further
connected
with
it.
of
the
moment
that
he
declines
to
answer
any
questions
when
they
say,
“well
how
about
1944
and
on
1948
or
yesterday?”
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
no,
i
do
not
say
and
--
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
i
do
not
say
that
membership
in
a
communist
party
as
of
the
1930s
or
at
1940s
in
and
of
itself
standing
alone
and
coupled
with
good
proof
from
that
time
on
down
would
--
would
disbar
him
or
--
or
make
the
man
unfit
for
certification.
but
when
he
declines
to
answer
a
question
and
let
anybody
else
find
out
how
he's
good
yesterday
or
the
day
before
then
i
say
that
it
does.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
standing
alone.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
i
don't
say
that.
i
think
if
they'd
have
a
right
to
inquire
further,
but
that
the
man
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
courts
have
consistently
placed
the
burden
of
proof
upon
him
would
have
to
answer
with
frankness.
and
this
court
has
so
--
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
that's
correct,
sir.
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
but
i
--
well,
i
--
i
apprehend
that
your
degrees
of
proof
for
a
criminal
conviction
and
those
for
a
denial
of
practice
of
law
or
even
disbarment
may
be
somewhat
different.
now,
may
i
just
include
in
closing,
point
out
just
briefly
to
this
court
some
of
the
utterances
which
he
just
has
made
and
while
we
have
cited
a
number
of
cases
in
the
brief,
i'm
only
going
to
refer
to
two.
and
i
do
this
because
of
the
very
obvious
separate
which
has
been
made
here
to
place
lawyers
in
a
different
category
than
public
employees
and
school
teachers.
and
i
say
to
this
court
that
i
want
lawyers
under
no
lesser
standard,
certainly
one
equally
strict
with
the
school
teachers
and
municipal
employees
if
not
even
more
so.
now,
in
the
well-known
adler
case
against
the
board
of
education
as
latest
342
u.s.,
this
court
said
in
response
to
an
argument
that
this
steinberg
law
constituted
an
abridgment
of
the
freedom
of
speech
and
assembly
of
person
seeking
employment
into
the
public
schools
of
new
york.
and
i
quote,
"it
is
clear
that
such
persons
have
the
right
under
our
laws
to
assemble,
speak,
think
and
believe
as
they
will,”
and
we
so
concede
to
this
petitioner.
the
court
continues
on.
it
is
equally
clear
that
they
have
no
right
to
work
for
the
state
in
the
school
system
on
their
own
term,
and
the
same
thing
may
be
said
with
respect
to
the
right
to
practice
law.
and
quoting
from
united
public
workers
versus
mitchell,
“they
may
work
for
the
school
system
upon
reasonable
terms
laid
down
by
the
proper
authorities
of
new
york.
if
they
do
not
choose
to
work
on
such
terms,
they
are
at
liberty
to
retain
their
belief
and
associations
and
go
elsewher.”
and
so
with
this
petitioner.
has
the
state
best
deprived
them
of
any
right
to
free
speech
or
assembly?
we
think
not.
such
persons
are
or
maybe
denied
under
the
statutes
in
question,
the
privilege
of
working
for
the
school
system
of
the
state
of
new
york
because
first,
of
their
advocacy
of
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
or
violence
or
secondly,
by
unexplained
membership
in
an
organization
found
by
the
school
authorities.
they
have
to
notice
in
hearing
to
teach
and
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence
and
known
by
such
persons
do
have
such
purpose.
according
in
that
case,
quoted
from
garner
against
the
los
angeles
board
of
public
works
as
follows.
"we
think
that
a
municipal
employer
is
not
disabled
because
it
is
an
agency
of
the
state
from
inquiring
of
its
employees
as
to
matters
that
may
prove
relevant
to
their
fitness
and
suitability
to
public
service.
past
conduct
may
well
relate
to
present
fitness.past
loyalty
may
have
a
reasonable
relationship
to
present
and
future
trust.both
are
commonly
inquired
into
in
determining
fitness
for
both
high
and
low
positions
in
private
industry
and
we
are
--
and
are
not
less
relevant
in
public
employment."
and
certainly
why
should
they
be
any
less
relevant
when
a
question
involved
is
one
of
admission
to
the
bar?
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
well,
perhaps
your
honor,
it's
overrating
the
influence
of
the
state
bar
with
the
legislature
but
otherwise
your
recitation
is
correct.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
no,
i
was
not
one
of
the
representatives
of
the
state
bar
--
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
oh,
yes.
the
bar
itself
did
not
support.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
correct.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
well,
sir,
that
--
that
is
the
american
bar
association
--
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
--
and
perhaps
it
is
not
quite
exposed
to
the
grassroots'
lawyers
as
the
state
bar
of
california.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
in
the
american
bar?
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
yes.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
well,
i
don't
really
know
but
i
would
imagine
that
they
would,
certainly
if
i
achieved
the
policy,
i
would.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
now,
with
respect
to
counsel's
auditory
statement.
here
that
we
have
no
right
to
inquire
into
this
man's
past
associates
or
the
position
which
he
took.
let's
see
what
this
court
has
said
about
that.
one's
associates
past
and
present
as
well
as
one's
conduct
may
properly
be
considered
in
determining
fitness
and
loyalty.
from
time
immemorial,
one's
reputation
has
been
determined
in
part
by
the
company
he
keeps.
in
the
employment
of
officials
and
teachers
of
the
school
system,
the
state
may
very
properly
inquire
into
the
company
they
keep
and
we
know
of
no
rule,
constitutional
or
otherwise
that
prevents
the
state
when
determining
a
fitness
and
loyalty
of
such
persons
from
considering
the
organizations
and
persons
with
whom
they
associate.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
well,
i
certainly
think
it
applies
to
lawyers,
sir
and
i
--
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
well,
that
--
that
language
of
course
must
receive
an
interpretation
of
reason
and
i
have
no
doubt
but
that
it
must
have
some
relevancy
to
the
object
to
be
obtained.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
that's
correct,
sir.
yet,
let's
take
a
look
at
the
summer's
case
from
illinois
in
which
a
man
was
denied
admission
there
by
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
because
of
his
religious
beliefs
in
unquestioned
good
faith,
which
would
have
prevented
him
from
bearing
arms
in
the
militia
of
the
state
of
illinois
when
they
had
a
constitutional
provision
which
would
permit
the
state
to
call
him
in
anytime
aboard.
and
they
denied
him
admission
on
that
ground.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
and
his
--
this
court
upheld
it.
now,
that
certainly
gone
a
lot
further
than
anything
if
we
--
that
we
have
advocate
--
that
we
advocate
in
this
case.
i
was
going
to
refer
to
the
cio-doud's
case
but
unquestionably,
it
will
be
read
by
the
court
in
reaching
its
conclusion
in
this
case.
but
in
summary,
may
i
simply
say
that
i
think
the
board
of
bar
examiners
of
the
state
of
california
and
the
supreme
court
in
passing
upon
that
very
conduct
was
more
than
warned
in
the
only
two
findings
which
they
made.
one,
that
this
man
had
failed
to
sustain
the
burden
of
proof
as
to
his
good
moral
character
and
that
he
failed
to
establish
that
he
did
not
advocate
the
use
of
force
and
violence
and
other
unconstitutional
means
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government.
and
therefore,
i
say
that
if
this
court
gets
passed
jurisdictional
question
into
the
merits
of
the
matter
that
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
