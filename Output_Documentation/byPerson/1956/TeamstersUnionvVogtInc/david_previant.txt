mr.
david
previant
if
the
court
please,
this
case
comes
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
to
review
a
judgment
of
that
court
which
restrains
the
petitioners
from
peaceful
picketing
at
the
place
of
employment
of
nonunion
workingmen.
litigation
was
initiated
in
the
circuit
court
for
waukesha
county
which
entered
ex
parte
temporary
and
permanent
injunctions
against
such
picketing.
on
appeal
to
the
wisconsin
supreme
court,
it,
first,
rendered
the
decision,
in
which
unanimously
held,
that
the
lower
court
was
in
error
and
reversed
the
lower
court
with
directions
to
dissolve
the
injunction.
upon
motion
for
rehearing
and
after
re-argument,
some
seven
months
later,
the
court
reversed
itself
and,
by
a
vote
of
six-to-one,
reinstated
the
permanent
injunction,
holding
that
it
was
in
error
in
its
first
opinion
when
it
directed
the
lower
court
to
dissolve
it.
mr.
david
previant
on
motion.
the
case
presents
the
question
whether
such
peaceful
picketing
at
the
place
of
employment
of
nonunion
employees,
unaccompanied
by
any
demand
upon
the
employer
and
preceded
only
by
a
solicitation
of
the
nonunion
employees,
is
protected
by
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
constitution
or
whether,
as
the
court
below
found
that
such
picketing
was
engaged
in
for
the
unlawful
purpose
of
compelling
the
employer,
through
economic
coercion,
to
interfere
with
the
rights
of
his
employees
not
to
join
a
union
in
violation
of
the
state
law.
the
evidentiary
facts
are
simple
and
they
are
undisputed.
the
employer
operates
a
place
of
business
in
a
gravel
pit
in
the
town
of
oconomowoc,
county
of
waukesha
in
the
state
of
wisconsin.
in
its
operations,
it
employees
from
some
10
to
15
employees,
all
of
whom
are
eligible
for
membership
in
either
of
the
three
unions
which
are
the
petitioners
here.
in
august
of
1953
and
again
in
april
of
1954,
the
petitioning
unions
solicited
directly
the
membership
of
these
nonunion
employees,
discussed
with
them
the
advantages
of
organization,
but
their
invitation
was
rejected.
now,
there
is
some
statement
in
respondent's
brief
that
this
solicitation
occurred
over
a
period
of
12
months.
the
record
does
not
so
show
it,
but
we
believe
it
is
immaterial.
after
the
refusal
of
the
employees
and,
again,
without
any
approach
ever
having
been
made
to
the
employer,
without
any
demand
ever
having
been
made
upon
the
employer,
the
petitioners
commenced
picketing.
they
picketed
at
the
site
of
the
gravel
pit
on
a
public
road
immediately
adjoining
the
gravel
pit
where
the
employer
maintained
his
place
of
business
and
where
the
nonunion
employees
were
working.
the
sign
which
they
displayed
carried
the
very
simple
and
truthful
legend
that
the
men
on
the
job
were
not
100%
affiliated
with
the
american
federation
of
labor.
and,
the
sign
was
signed
by
the
three
unions
involved,
the
building
and
construction
labor's
union,
the
operating
engineers'
union
and
the
teamsters
union
and,
that
is,
the
local
unions
of
those
organizations.
there
is
no
proof
with
respect
to
the
extent
of
the
traffic
which
used
the
road.
there
was
no
proof
with
the
extent
to
the
number
of
customers
which
might
come
to
that
particular
job
site
to
transact
business
with
the
employer.
the
picketing
was
completely
peaceful
and
completely
orderly.
there
was
no
obstruction
of
any
kind,
no
threats,
and
no
violence.
mr.
david
previant
two
or
three,
sometimes
one.
the
record
is
--
i
don't
believe
that
there's
even
a
reference
in
the
record
to
that.
it
may
be,
if
there
is,
that
there
were
one.
but,
there
was
no
mass
picketing,
no
finding
of
mass
picketing
of
any
kind.
now,
some
truck
drivers
of
material
suppliers
to
this
place
of
business
refused
to
go
through
that
picket
line.
in
consequence
of
which,
the
employer
used
his
own
trucks
with
which
to
pick
up
the
materials
which
had
been
or
would
have
been
delivered
by
these
other
truck
drivers
who
did
not
go
through
the
line.
he
did
sustain
inconvenience.
he
sustained
expense
and
he
sustained
damage.
when
i
say
“he,”
i
speak
of
the
employer.
now,
all
of
these
facts
were
alleged
by
the
employer
and
they
were
admitted
procedurally
by
the
petitioners.
i
say,
therefore,
there
is
no
undisputed
evidentiary
fact
in
the
record.
when
respondent
says
that
there
is
some
dispute,
respondent
refers
to
the
allegation,
also
contained
in
the
bill
of
complaint,
that
the
picketing
was
unlawful
because
it
was
indulged
in
or
engaged
in
for
the
purpose
of
coercing
the
employer
to
coerce
the
employees
in
the
exercise
of
the
right
not
to
join
a
union
and,
therefore,
to
coerce
him
in
violation
of
state
law
and,
therefore,
the
picketing
was
unlawfully
purposed.
it
was
also
charged
that
the
picketing
was
unlawful
per
se
because
of
the
existence
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
of
a
statute
which
defines
a
labor
dispute
as
a
controversy
over
wages
and
working
conditions
between
an
employer
and
a
majority
of
his
employees
and
a
further
statute
which
says
that
unless
there
is
a
labor
dispute
as
so
defined,
picketing
is
unlawful.
the
union
denied
the
unlawful
purposes.
the
union
asserted
that
the
wages
and
working
conditions
of
these
employees
were
less
than
those
which
prevailed
in
union
contracts.
they
asserted
the
desirability
of
inducing
these
employees
to
join
their
union
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
their
standards,
and
they
asserted
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
wisconsin
statute
which
was
invoked
defining
a
labor
dispute
and
prohibiting
picketing
unless
pursuant
to
a
dispute
so
defined
and
asserted
also
that
any
restraining
order
or
injunction
which
might
be
entered
under
these
factual
circumstances
would
deprive
them
of
their
rights
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
conjoined
with
the
first
amendment.
in
the
circuit
court,
or
what
would
ordinarily
be
the
trial
court,
in
view
of
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
and
the
admissions
of
the
petitioners
here,
there
was
no
evidence
taken.
the
court
made
its
decision
based
upon
those
uncontroverted
facts.
it
found,
number
one,
that
there
was
no
unlawful
purpose.
it
found,
number
two,
that
there
was
a
purpose
to
organize
the
employees
who
did
not
belong
to
the
union,
said,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
to
induce
the
plaintiff's
employees
to
organize
and
affiliate
with
the
unions.
it
found
that
to
be
the
purpose.
however,
it
felt
that
it
was
bound
by
the
wisconsin
statutory
scheme
of
prohibiting
picketing
unless
the
picketing
was
pursuant
to
a
dispute
between
a
majority
of
the
employees
and
the
employer.
so,
it
found
the
picketing
unlawful,
under
the
statute
which
i've
alluded
to,
and
entered
a
temporary
injunction
restraining
the
picketing.
the
parties
there
upon
stipulated
that
the
record
contained
all
of
the
facts
that
would
be
adduced
in
court
on
the
merits.
and,
on
such
stipulation,
the
court
then
entered
its
permanent
injunction
making,
again,
the
same
findings
of
facts
and
the
same
conclusions
of
law.
from
that
point,
the
unions
took
an
appeal
to
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
and
because
the
holding
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
initially
is
pertinent
to
these
proceedings
with
the
leave
of
court.
i
would
like
to
quote
this
one
flat
unequivocal
finding
of
the
wisconsin
court
in
the
first
decision.
the
court
said,
“the
testimony
would
not
have
supported
a
finding
of
the
facts
constituting
a
violation
of
either
of
the
subsections.”
mr.
david
previant
111.06
(2)(a)
restrains
the
unions
from
coercing
employees
in
their
right
to
join
or
not
to
join
a
union.
111.06
(2)(b)
restrains
employers
in
the
exercise
of
the
right
to
join
or
not
to
join
a
union.
mr.
david
previant
the
final
rehearing
was
that
the
violation
of
(b)
and
that
is
all
that
is
involved
in
this
case.
now,
again,
the
wisconsin
court
said
no
threats
were
made
against
the
plaintiff.
no
demands
were
made
upon
them.
it
does
not
appear
that
any
of
it's
--
it
does
not
appear
that
any
of
the
defendant's
representatives
had
even
spoken
to
plaintiff
law
officers
about
their
desire
to
organize
its
employees.
there
was
no
violence,
no
force,
no
threat
of
force,
no
disorder,
or
physical
destruction
to
plaintiff's
property.
there
was
no
evidence
that
defendant's
representatives
had
coerced
or
intimidated
any
of
plaintiff's
employees
in
the
right
to
join
or
refuse
to
join
either
of
the
defendant
unions.
there
was
only
peaceful
persuasion
exercised
by
the
carrying
of
a
banner
bearing
a
truthful
legend.
mr.
david
previant
it
did
not.
mr.
david
previant
yes,
the
case
would
be
in
no
different
posture
at
all
because
we
say
that,
on
these
--
mr.
david
previant
on
these
--
mr.
david
previant
it
could
not
have
found
coercion
to
accomplish
an
unlawful
purpose
in
violation
of
wisconsin
statue.
when
you
say
“coercion,”
of
course
you're
speaking
of
a
term
that
has
many
meanings,
but
--
mr.
david
previant
--
but
it
may
have
been
coercive.
it
may
have
been
compulsive.
it
may
have
been
inducing.
there
are
many
adjectives
that
might
describe
the
effect
which
picketing
may
have.
but,
to
say
that
it
is
illegally
coercive,
in
that,
it
was
to
compel
the
commission
of
an
unlawful
act
is
an
entirely
different
thing.
that
is
the
finding
which
the
trial
court
refused
to
make.
that
is
the
finding
which
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
refused
to
make
in
the
first
decision.
that
is
the
finding
which
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
made
in
its
second
decision.
mr.
david
previant
well,
it
raises,
of
course,
questions
that
are
not
here
present
because
--
mr.
david
previant
--
that
is
not
the
fact.
mr.
david
previant
no,
because
the
wisconsin
court
expressively
rejected
any
idea
that
union
here
was
coercing
the
employees
for
recognition
or
that
the
union
was
claiming
to
recognize
them.
it
expressively
rejected
any
finding
that
the
picketing
activities
were
coercive
of
the
employees.
mr.
david
previant
then,
i
misapprehended
the
question.
mr.
david
previant
even
though
the
union
may,
at
that
time,
represent
a
majority?
mr.
david
previant
even
though
the
union
may,
at
that
time,
represent
a
majority?
mr.
david
previant
well,
if
the
union
represents
a
majority,
it
raises
other
questions.
i
believe
that
the
picketing
would
be
protected
in
that
instance.
but,
it
raises
a
question
which
is
not
present
here
because,
although
the
court
found
that
kind
of
purpose
here,
we
say
the
record
would
not
support
such
finding.
we
have
never
made
a
claim
to
represent
--
mr.
david
previant
--
a
majority
of
the
employees.
mr.
david
previant
the
picketing
was
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
union
standards.
it
was
hoped
that,
ultimately,
we
might
persuade
these
employees
to
join
the
union.
it
was
hoped
that,
during
that
period
of
time,
we
might
divert
patronage,
--
mr.
david
previant
--
of
course,
to
the
union's
place.
mr.
david
previant
yes.
mr.
david
previant
well,
now,
the
wisconsin
court
did
find
that
this
was
coercion
to
get
union
recognition
by
using
the
influence
of
the
employer
in
that
regard.
in
other
words,
by
either
having
the
employer
say
to
the
union,
“i
recognize
you”
or
having
the
employer
say
to
the
employees,
“you
must
join
the
union
or
i'll
discharge
you”
and
thereby
putting
the
union
in
a
position
of
representing
the
employees.
now,
that's
what
the
wisconsin
court
said.
and,
we're
not
according
with
any
statutory
policy
that
says
an
employee
has
a
right
to
refuse
the
join
a
union,
that
says
that
an
employer
must
not
interfere
with
the
exercise
of
that
right,
and
that
says
a
union
shall
not
picket
the
employer
to
compel
the
employer
to
interfere
with
the
exercise
of
that
right.
that's
been
decided
here,
but
that
is
not
this
case.
mr.
david
previant
well,
i
think
in
one
--
mr.
david
previant
in
one
sense,
you're
talking
about
coercing
the
violation
of
the
state
law.
in
the
other
sense
--
mr.
david
previant
that's
the
state
law
now,
your
honor.
mr.
david
previant
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
david
previant
i
think
the
question
that
is
raised
here
is
whether
or
not,
on
these
facts,
--
mr.
david
previant
that's
right.
that's
right,
we're
attacking
the
validity
of
an
injunction
purportedly
based
upon
the
statue
which
deprives
us
of
constitutional
rights.
mr.
david
previant
well,
it
depends
upon
the
inferences
the
court
drew
from
undisputed
facts
where
a
primary
constitutional
right
is
involved.
mr.
david
previant
well
--
mr.
david
previant
it's
precisely
our
position,
your
honor.
the
wisconsin
court
did
reject
the
idea
that
picketing
here
could
have
been
restrained
because
of
the
statute
which
said
it
had
to
be
only
in
pursuance
of
the
dispute
between
a
majority
and
an
employer.
in
fact,
in
another
case
decided
the
same
day,
it
had
declared
that
statute
unconstitutional
and
they
had
refused
to
apply
that
principle
on
this
case
on
the
authority
of
the
swing
and
wohl
cases.
on
rehearing,
however,
without
the
--
without
any
further
facts,
without
any
further
evidence,
and
without
referring
to
any
further
acts,
the
court
concluded
that
it
was
in
error
in
making
its
initial
finding
that
the
record
would
not
support
a
finding
of
unlawful
purpose.
it
said
it
had
given
insufficient
consideration
to
other
rights
which
might
be
involved
in
the
situation.
it
said
it
had
a
right
to
draw
its
own
inferences
from
the
undisputed
facts,
just
as
we
say
this
court
has
the
right
to
do
so.
it
concluded
that
the
union
hoped
that
the
picketing
would
interfere
with
the
business
of
the
employer
and,
thus,
bring
pressure
upon
the
employer
to
coerce
the
employees
to
join
the
union.
it
concluded
that
the
message
of
the
banner
could
not
have
been
of
any
enlightenment
to
the
employees
because
the
employees
had
already
been
solicited
and
were
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
union
wanted
them
to
join.
it
concluded
that,
since
the
picketing
was
on
a
country
road
and
business
was
patronized
by
only
a
small
number
of
customers.
when
i
say
that,
that's
an
inference
which
the
court
drew,
it's
not
in
the
record.
this
picketing
could
not
be
the
guidance
of
the
--
or
it
could
not
for
the
guidance
of
the
community.
so,
having
rejected
those
possible
bases
for
picketing,
it
came
to
the
ultimate
conclusion
that
the
only
purpose
was
to
influence
the
deliverymen
and
this
would
then
compel
the
employer
because
of
the
inconvenience
and
damage
sustained
by
it
to
either
continue
--
permit
the
continuance
of
the
picketing
with
loss
to
him
and,
possibly,
the
loss
of
his
business
or
by
some
means
or
other
coerce
his
employees,
in
violation
of
the
wisconsin
statute,
to
join
the
union
in
violation
of
section
111.06
(2)(b)
and,
therefore,
the
court
vacated
its
original
mandate
that
reinstated
initial
judgment.
the
unions
were
permanently
restrained
from
engaging
in
any
picketing
at
or
about
the
premises
where
the
nonunion
employees
were
employed
and
where
business
is
located.
mr.
david
previant
well,
october
is
when
the
case
was
reargued,
your
honor.
mr.
david
previant
the
decision
of
the
court
was
announced
in
february
of
the
following
year,
over
a
period
of
some-six
or
seven
months,
the
shifting
position
took
place,
that's
right.
mr.
david
previant
same
court,
no
change
in
personnel,
same
counsel
on
the
case.
mr.
david
previant
that's
right.
the
picketing
cases
of
this
court
are
very
extensively
reviewed
in
the
brief
that
was
filed
here
by
amicus
curiae.
we
don't
intend
to
examine
and
analyze
each
of
those
cases
in
detail.
they
may
be
summarized
generally
and
briefly,
as
holding
number
one,
that
picketing
is
the
working
man's
means
of
communication.
it
is
a
form
of
free
speech.
number
two,
that
in
some
aspects
it
has
some
plus
considerations
and,
so,
it
may
be
a
little
bit
more
than
free
speech
and,
therefore,
it
is
subject
to
regulation
by
the
state
in
some
limited
aspects.
those
limited
aspects,
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
were
that
picketing
which
is
enmeshed
with
violence
or
in
a
background
of
violence
could
be
restrained,
or
that
picketing
a
place
which
has
no
economic
connection
with
the
area
of
the
dispute
could
be
restrained,
or
that
picketing
to
compel
the
violation
of
a
valid
state
policy
could
be
restrained.
this
court
did
make
it
clear,
however,
that
picketing
to
--
could
not
be
restrained
merely
based
upon
the
state's
notion
of
what
is
a
labor
dispute
or
trying
to
establish
artificial
bounds
to
a
labor
dispute.
actually,
this
case
involves
that
series
of
cases
in
which
this
court
held
that
picketing
to
compel
a
violation
of
the
valid
state
policy
may
be
regulated
or
restrained
by
the
state
regardless
of
whether
that
state
policy
is
announced
by
the
judiciary
or
by
the
legislative
branch
of
the
state.
mr.
david
previant
well,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
david
previant
that's
right.
mr.
david
previant
that's
right.
mr.
david
previant
that's
true
and
what
i
--
mr.
david
previant
that's
right.
mr.
david
previant
no.
mr.
david
previant
yes.
mr.
david
previant
no,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
you're
right.
what
i
am
seeking
to
do
here
inept
way
is
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
that
is
the
only
issue
and
that
we
should
not
be
detoured
from
that
issue
by
appeals
that
had
been
made
by
the
respondents
here
with
respect
to
other
policies
which
might
be
applied,
or
the
strength
of
a
labor
union,
or
the
growth
of
a
labor
union,
or
change
of
economic
circumstances.
that
is
the
only
issue
here.
mr.
david
previant
and,
we
say,
in
considering
this
record,
this
court
is
not
bound
by
the
conclusions
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
with
respect
to
the
purpose
of
the
picketing
based
upon
undisputed
facts
in
the
record.
we
say
that
that
is
not
a
finding
of
fact.
it
is
a
conclusion
of
law.
it
is,
at
most,
a
mixed
finding
of
fact
of
law
and
that
this
court
has
traditionally
asserted
its
right
to
draw
its
own
conclusions
whereas,
here,
the
facts
are
undisputed.
we
say
that
even
if
it
may
be
considered
a
finding
of
fact,
as
distinguished
from
a
conclusion
or
inference
of
law,
that
it's
still
subject
to
independent
review
and
evaluation
here
because
it
involves
a
claim
of
first
rank
and
that's
his
rights
under
the
first
amendment.
that
was
decided,
we
say,
by
this
court
not
only
in
the
other
civil
liberties
cases
involving
coerced
confessions
or
discrimination
in
the
empanelling
of
juries,
but
was
decided
by
this
court
in
the
very
picketing
cases
which
have
previously
been
before
this
court,
and
i
refer
to
thornhill,
meadowmoor,
and
graham
in
which
this
court
said
so.
we
think
there's
one
other
consideration
which
this
court
must
give
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
inference
or
the
conclusion
drawn
from
wisconsin
is
a
valid
one
and,
that
is,
we
believe,
the
presumption
which
would
ordinarily
prevail
in
favor
of
state
action
does
not
operate
when,
as
here,
a
substantial
claim
is
made
to
first
amendment
rights.
we
say
this
normal
presumption
must
yield
because
of
the
presence
of
other
considerations,
other
than
the
comity
between
state
and
federal
government.
the
freedom
of
expression,
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
is
the
rule.
the
restraint
is
the
exception
and
any
doubt,
we
say,
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
must
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
fundamental
right.
where
they
had
at
least
--
mr.
david
previant
i
think
it's
settled.
i
think
there's
some
--
mr.
david
previant
--
i
think
there's
some
question
about
the
language
to
be
used
in
describing
that
situation.
i
appreciate
that
some
of
the
justices
feel
that
they
are
in
a
preferred
position.
i
appreciate
that
some
of
the
justices
feel
that
they
have
a
momentum
for
respect.
i
think,
to
quote
justice
frankfurter's
language,
but
i
think,
in
any
event,
all
of
you
have
agreed
that
they
are
entitled
to
a
great
weight
--
a
sufficient
weight
to
overcome
the
presumption
of
constitutionality.
i
think
where
the
figure
of
agreement
is
that
there
is
no
presumption
of
unconstitutionality
in
examining
the
statute.
now,
we
do
not
so
here
assert
that
there
is
a
presumption
of
unconstitutionality
in
the
action
taken
by
the
state
here
through
its
judiciary.
mr.
david
previant
i
think
it's
a
little
bit
more
than
that.
mr.
david
previant
right.
mr.
david
previant
well,
we
say
that
--
well,
certainly,
under
the
decisions
of
--
mr.
david
previant
well,
all
right.
well,
we
do
say
that,
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
no
matter
what
the
test
the
court
may
have
applied,
the
court
has
made
it
fairly
clear,
it
seems
to
me,
that
there
is
a
heavy
burden
upon
those
who
would
justify
the
restraint
to
prove
the
basis
for
that
restraint,
and
that
you
need
clear
unequivocal
and
convincing
proof.
mr.
david
previant
well,
i
think
i'm
coming
out
with
what
this
court
has
adopted
as
its
own
test.
mr.
david
previant
well,
i
--
mr.
david
previant
i'm
quoting
what
i
believe
are
the
--
mr.
david
previant
well,
again,
i
don't
--
mr.
david
previant
--
suppose
we're
going
to
get
into
an
argument
on
semantics
as
to
what
is
--
mr.
david
previant
well,
all
right.
at
least,
the
court
has
agreed
also
that
there
is
required
a
solidity
of
evidence.
in
other
words,
if
you're
dealing
with
these
rights,
whether
you
say
go
slow
or
whether
you
say
the
burden
has
shifted
or
whether
you
say
the
presumption
has
shifted,
you
must
have
something
in
the
record
more
than
the
various
kind
of
an
inference
based
upon
speculation
or
remote
possibilities.
mr.
david
previant
certainly
--
mr.
david
previant
yes,
and
we
say
that,
on
this
state
of
facts,
here's
a
quote
that
made
this
--
made
a
completely
opposite
judgment
--
mr.
david
previant
--
on
the
identical
--
mr.
david
previant
i
think
that
more
frequently
happens
concerning
questions
of
law
than
it
does
concerning
conclusions
to
be
drawn
from
undisputed
facts,
your
honor.
mr.
david
previant
that
is
the
effect
of
the
statute,
yes.
and
we
don't
quarrel
with
that
policy.
mr.
david
previant
we
do
not.
mr.
david
previant
that's
true.
mr.
david
previant
well,
the
record
fails
to
show
any
--
any
evidence
that
there
was
a
purpose
here
to
compel
an
employer
to
violate
the
rights
of
his
employees.
mr.
david
previant
not
to
join
this
labor
union.
mr.
david
previant
that's
right.
we
say
that
the
employee
has
a
right
not
to
join.
we
say
that
the
employer
may
not
coerce
him
in
that
right
not
to
join.
we
say
the
union
may
not
coerce
the
employer
to
coerce
the
employee
in
his
right
not
to
join.
and,
we
say
there
is
not
one
single
fact
in
this
record
from
which
a
reasonable
inference
may
be
drawn,
from
which
a
finding
may
be
made,
that
the
picketing,
under
these
facts
and
under
these
circumstances,
was
for
the
purpose
of
coercing
the
employer
to
interfere
with
the
rights
of
his
employees.
mr.
david
previant
yes,
yes.
mr.
david
previant
that's
the
point.
the
evidence
is
only
this.
a
solicitation
of
nonunion
employees
by
representatives
of
the
labor
union
and
a
discussion
with
them
of
the
advantages
of
organization,
followed
by
peaceful
picketing
with
a
truthful
banner
at
the
site
at
which
these
nonunion
employees
are
working,
unaccompanied
by
any
threats,
violence
or
intimidation,
unaccompanied
by
any
demand
made
upon
the
employer
to
enter
into
a
contract
with
the
union
or
to
interfere
with
the
rights
of
his
employees
not
to
join
or
to
join
the
union.
mr.
david
previant
no
demand.
there
was
never
any
demand
made
upon
the
employer,
never
any
discussion
with
the
employer
with
respect
to
this
matter.
the
union
confined
itself
to
the
solicitation
of
the
employees
and
to
picketing
when
the
employees
refused
that
solicitation.
mr.
david
previant
picketing
at
or
near
the
place
of
the
dispute,
the
place
of
employment.
mr.
david
previant
displaying
a
standard
--
mr.
david
previant
on
a
public
highway,
county
trunk
p,
adjoining
the
place
of
employment.
mr.
david
previant
that's
all
they
did.
mr.
david
previant
they
marched
at
the
entrance
which
was
a
private
road
leading
into
the
gravel
pit,
the
private
road
led
off
of
the
public
highway.
mr.
david
previant
no,
there's
been
no
such
suggestion
in
this
case
and
there's
no
law
to
my
knowledge
that
would
make
it
unlawful.
mr.
david
previant
they
had
a
placard.
mr.
david
previant
not
per
se.
mr.
david
previant
the
placard
said
that
the
employees
at
this
establishment
are
not
100%
affiliated
with
the
a.f.of
l.
mr.
david
previant
that's
all
the
sign
ever
said.
mr.
david
previant
never
any
connection
with
the
employer
at
all.
never
any
approach
to
the
employer,
never
any
discussion
with
him.
mr.
david
previant
well,
the
argument
runs
something
like
this
as
we
read
the
opinion.
you
couldn't
have
been
picketing
to
--
to
persuade
these
employees
to
join
the
union
because
you
have
already
solicited
them
and
that
solicitation
was
unsuccessful.
you
couldn't
be
picketing
to
inform
the
public
because
not
many
people
travel
this
road.
therefore,
we
think
you
are
picketing
as
a
signal
so
that
anybody
who
wanted
to
make
a
delivery
and
who
might
be
sympathetic
to
your
cause
would
not
go
through
the
picket
sign.
mr.
david
previant
no,
it
does
not.
the
statute
--
mr.
david
previant
--
does
not
forbid
that.
mr.
david
previant
well,
let's
follow
--
mr.
david
previant
all
right
--
mr.
david
previant
this
is
--
this
is
the
chain
of
reasoning.
if
you
are
picketing
as
a
signal
to
a
deliverymen,
then
you
must
be
picketing
to
hurt
the
employer.
if
you
are
picketing
to
hurt
the
employer,
it
must
be
to
compel
the
employer
to
do
one
of
two
things,
either
tolerate
the
picketing
or
violate
the
law
to
get
out
from
under.
therefore,
on
that
chain
of
reasoning
and
logic,
we
now
go
back
to
the
initial
picketing
and
find
it
is
to
accomplish
this
unlawful
purpose
of
compelling
the
employer
to
violate
the
state
statute.
we
--
mr.
david
previant
that
would
be
the
violation.
mr.
david
previant
that
would
be
the
violation,
your
honor.
that's
right.
mr.
david
previant
no.
mr.
david
previant
there
was
no
--
mr.
david
previant
well,
yes.
there
was
a
discussion
with
respect
to
the
advantages
of
unionism
but
that
discussion
--
mr.
david
previant
--
took
place
between
the
employees
and
the
union
representative.
mr.
david
previant
none
whatsoever.
mr.
david
previant
yes.
mr.
david
previant
no,
there
was
never
any
demand
on
the
--
mr.
david
previant
--
employer,
your
honor.
mr.
david
previant
never
any
discussion
with
the
employer.
mr.
david
previant
yes.
mr.
david
previant
surely,
it
did.
mr.
david
previant
that's
true.
mr.
david
previant
that
--
well,
the
industrial
objective
was
to
protect
standards.
in
the
protection
of
the
standards,
joining
the
union
would
be
one
way
of
doing
it,
certainly.
mr.
david
previant
well
--
it
was,
surely.
mr.
david
previant
that's
right.
mr.
david
previant
made
upon
the
employer.
mr.
david
previant
that's
right.
mr.
david
previant
that's
right.
it's
just
that
--
that
simple.
now,
as
i
say,
the
chain
of
reasoning
--
mr.
david
previant
yes.
well,
that
would
be
the
net
result.
actually,
the
--
mr.
david
previant
well,
now
--
mr.
david
previant
i
think
we're
--
mr.
david
previant
excuse
me.
mr.
david
previant
it
would
still
violate
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
mr.
david
previant
well
--
mr.
david
previant
that's
right.
mr.
david
previant
yes,
but
we
are
not
in
a
position,
mr.
justice
black,
of
challenging
the
second
kind
of
a
statute
which
you
--
which
you
say
this
might
be
result
in.
we
are
challenging
here
the
application
of
a
valid
statute.
mr.
david
previant
we
don't
want
to
--
mr.
david
previant
in
this
case
--
mr.
david
previant
except
--
mr.
david
previant
yes.
mr.
david
previant
well,
we
would
rather
put
it
this
way,
your
honor.
we
would
rather
say
that
the
net
result
of
this
decision
is
to
completely
set
with
any
vitality
the
holding
of
this
court
that
there
can
be
a
labor
dispute
even
though
the
employees
are
not
in
the
employment
of
the
employer
because,
actually,
what
they
have
said
here
--
mr.
david
previant
yes.
mr.
david
previant
well,
they
have
done
it
in
a
much
more
subtle
fashion,
your
honor.
mr.
david
previant
well,
that
is
the
net
result.
mr.
david
previant
well,
we
think
it
is.
mr.
david
previant
we
think
it
is.
we
appreciate
that
this
court
has
felt
otherwise.
we
believe
that
it
is,
actually,
a
public
advertising,
whether
--
mr.
david
previant
--
whether
it's
--
mr.
david
previant
--
there
or
in
the
press.
mr.
david
previant
yes.
mr.
david
previant
otherwise,
in
what,
your
honor?
well,
this
court
has
indicated
--
mr.
david
previant
no.
no,
this
court
has
not
held
that
it
was
less
lawful
in
that
circumstance.
this
court
has
held
that,
in
some
circumstances,
the
usual
attributes
or
the
usual
protections
which
have
been
given
to
speech
as
evidenced
by
newspapers
or
by
film
or
by
pamphlet,
does
not
extend
completely
to
the
protection
that
would
be
afforded
to
speech
which
is
evidenced
by
picketing.
that's
what
this
court
has
done.
mr.
david
previant
yes.
mr.
david
previant
yes,
you
have.
mr.
david
previant
you've
restrained
it
--
mr.
david
previant
well
--
mr.
david
previant
well,
i
know
what
this
court
has
done
with
respect
to
mass
picketing,
with
respect
to
picketing
for
an
unlawful
purpose,
with
respect
to
picketing
enmeshed
with
violence,
with
respect
to
picketing
outside
of
the
industrial
dispute.
mr.
david
previant
yes.
mr.
david
previant
that's
right.
mr.
david
previant
and
that
is
the
distinction
which
i
said
this
court
has
drawn.
mr.
david
previant
well,
it's
a
distinction
which
i've
also
said
i
do
not
agree
with,
but
it
is
--
mr.
david
previant
--
there,
nevertheless.
mr.
david
previant
we're
confronted
with
it.
mr.
david
previant
yes.
but,
as
i
say,
we're
confronted
with
that
situation
and
we
do
not
here
seek
to
reverse
that
holding,
nor
to
quarrel
with
it,
nor
in
any
way
to
say
that
it
should
not
be
applied
here.
mr.
david
previant
sure.
mr.
david
previant
i'm
sorry?
mr.
david
previant
it
was
the
conclusion
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
in
the
second
opinion
that
that
was
the
hope
or
the
intent
of
the
union.
that
was
the
conclusion
drawn
from
this
undisputed
facts
by
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
--
mr.
david
previant
--
that
the
picketing
was
a
signal
for
that
purpose.
mr.
david
previant
what
in
--
well,
it's
not
a
finding
of
fact.
i
say
it's
a
kind
of
conclusion
that
is
reviewable
here.
it's
an
inference
which
we
say
could
not
have
been
drawn
from
this
matter.
mr.
david
previant
well,
all
right.
mr.
david
previant
but
--
our
position
then,
certainly,
is
that
a
signal
is
known
as
communication
in
any
other
form.
mr.
david
previant
well,
if
we
were
to
assume
that
one
of
the
objects,
one
of
the
things
that
at
least
the
union
foresaw
was
that
this
would
act
as
a
signal,
it
would
not
flow
from
that
that,
because
some
person,
the
employer
in
this
case,
might
violate
the
law
as
the
consequence
of
what
is
agreed
to
be
the
exercise
of
a
constitutional
right,
you
can
then
reason
backward
from
a
subjective
reaction
of
the
employer
to
the
consequential
damage
and
say
that
the
action,
therefore,
in
its
beginning
was
unlawful.
mr.
david
previant
well
--
mr.
david
previant
no.
mr.
david
previant
no.
mr.
david
previant
well,
on
that
hypothesis,
i
don't
have
a
case
because
you
have
assumed
what
has
to
be
proven
here
and
which
was
not
proven.
you
have
assumed
in
your
statement
that,
number
one,
it
was
intended
solely
to
be
a
signal.
number
two,
that
the
signal
was
responded
to.
number
three,
we
knew
it
would
be
responded
to.
number
four,
we
knew
if
it
were
responded
to,
it
would
hurt
the
employer.
number
five,
we
knew
that
it
would
hurt
the
employer,
he
would
violate
the
law.
therefore,
we
intended
to
hurt
the
employer
to
violate
the
law.
therefore,
we
go
back
to
the
signal
and
say
it
is
no
longer
constitutionality
protected.
now,
it's
that
kind
of
a
priori
reasoning,
non-sectarian
reasoning,
upside
down
or
backward
reasoning
that
motivated
the
court,
in
our
opinion,
in
this
case.
mr.
david
previant
to
say
that
picketing
was
--
mr.
david
previant
we
may
or
we
may
not,
and
i
don't
know
that
that's
the
test,
whether
effectiveness
is
the
test.
it
may
be
that,
in
a
particular
community,
the
state
of
organization
is
so
high
that
even
a
newspaper
ad
might
induce
a
great
many
union
people
not
to
go
to
the
store
or
to
make
deliveries
to
the
store
or
to
the
gravel
pit.
it
may
be,
as
in
a
small
community
like
waukesha
county,
that
neither
picketing,
nor
advertising,
nor
radio,
nor
movies
would
persuade
anybody
not
to
continue
to
do
business
with
this
employer
or
not
to
continue
to
go
to
that
employer's
place
of
business.
but,
i
say
that
our
right
to
picket,
a
constitutional
right,
if
you
please,
does
not
depend
upon
such
slender
rights
that
we're
going
to
look
to
the
effectiveness,
that
we're
going
to
look
to
the
subjective
results,
and
then
reason
backwards
from
that
point
to
determine
whether,
in
the
first
instance,
we
were
unlawfully
purposed
when
placed
that
picket
or
we
were
malicious
or
we
intended
deliberately
to
run
somebody
out
of
business
in
this
way
or
compel
it
in
the
alternative
to
violate
the
law.
and,
that
is
what
wisconsin
did
to
us
here.
they
made
that
conclusion
on
the
record
which,
in
our
opinion,
is
completely
excepted
or
completely
lacking
in
any
justification
for
that
kind
of
a
conclusion.
mr.
david
previant
yes.
yes,
it
would
--
mr.
david
previant
it
would
make
a
difference.
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
particularly
the
gazzam
case,
we
would
then
be
in
the
position
of,
ever
having
--
after
having
asked
the
employer
to
put
his
employees
into
the
union
or
to
sign
a
contract
with
us
at
a
time
where
he
was
legally
inhibited
from
doing
so,
nevertheless,
to
do
so
and
then,
because
he
refused
to
be
picketed,
then
we
have
an
entirely
different
picture.
it
is
not
the
picture
that
is
here
at
all.
that
was
the
picture
--
mr.
david
previant
--
that
was
already
before
this
court.
mr.
david
previant
well,
i
don't
know
that
we're
talking
here
about
the
absence
of
elements.
there
--
supposing
we
had
not
engaged
in
any
solicitation
whatsoever
and
merely
coldly
put
out
a
picket
at
this
particular
place.
there
might
be,
then,
a
great
deal
more
basis
for
drawing
an
inference
that
we're
trying
to
put
the
heat
on
the
employer
because
we've
made
glorified
effort
to
interest
these
people
in
organization.
supposing
we
had
drop
a
hint
some
place
down
the
line
to
one
of
the
employer's
competitors.
we're
going
to
make
this
employer
sign
the
contract
and
then
we
picketed,
but
nothing
like
that
is
in
this
record
and
that
is
precisely
our
point,
your
honor.
mr.
david
previant
surely,
we
did.
we
were
trying
to
persuade
this
nonunion
people
to
join
our
union.
we
were
trying
to
advice
our
friends
and
our
sympathizers
that
these
people
were
not
union,
that
they
were
destroying
the
very
standard
which
we
had
fought
to
maintain.
mr.
david
previant
and,
the
--
mr.
david
previant
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
we
had
no
right
to
persuade
an
employer
and
i
don't
believe
that
a
court
should
draw
the
inference
that
we're
trying
to
make
the
employer
commit
an
unlawful
act.
mr.
david
previant
no.
i
think
we're
entitled
to
the
assumption
that
we
did
not
intend
for
anybody
to
violate
any
law.
and,
i
don't
think
that
the
inference
should
be
drawn
that
we
did
in
the
absence
of
evidence
to
support
that
inference.
mr.
david
previant
well,
it
is
for
that
reason,
your
honor,
that
we
did
not
agree,
or
that
we
fought,
or
at
least
litigated
the
problem
of
the
unlawful
purpose
for
just
that
reason.
now,
what
has
happened
is
this.
that,
once
this
court
announced
its
unlawful
purpose
doctrine,
the
courts
that
formally
did
pay
at
least
lip
service
to
the
early
decisions
of
the
court
are
stirring
around
in
these
records
to
find
that
unlawful
purpose.
now,
without
intending
any
disrespect
for
the
wisconsin
court,
we
say
that's
exactly
what
it
did
on
the
rehearing
in
this
case.
it
did
find,
on
the
record
of
what
you
first
said
there
couldn't
possibly
be
such
finding.
mr.
david
previant
surely,
what
--
mr.
david
previant
what
happened
is
shear
speculation.
i
don't
know
what
happened.
mr.
david
previant
well,
i
think,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
i
have
just
about
exhausted
all
of
the
time
and
there
might
be
something
i
want
to
say
in
the
remaining
five
minutes,
i
will
sit
down.
mr.
david
previant
thank
you.
mr.
david
previant
i'm
addressing
myself
to
the
question
asked
from
mr.
chief
justice
warren.
there
was
no
allegation
and
there
was
no
proof
with
respect
to
the
number
of
people
who
travels
on
this
county
highway,
this
country
road,
or
with
respect
to
the
number
of
customers
that
might
be
there.
it
first
arose
in
the
court's
decision
on
the
motion
for
rehearing
and
we,
in
a
footnote
to
our
brief,
point
out
that
there
is
no
evidence
to
support
it.
i
think
the
case
has
been
thoroughly
canvassed.i
just
want
to
point
out
that
there
are
other
alternatives
to
an
employer
in
this
position.
many
employers
survive
picketing
very
well.
many
employers,
in
fact,
increase
their
business
on
the
patronage
of
those
who,
for
some
reason
or
other,
are
not
sympathetic
to
the
union's
cause.
if
any,
this
particular
employer
might
increase
his
truck
fleet
to
get
his
deliveries
just
on
the
money
he
may
be
saving
by
his
employees
not
being
members
of
the
union
and
not
drawing
the
union
wage.
and,
finally,
although
we
have
never
ourselves
believed
that
an
employer
should
be
anything
but
strictly
neutral
in
these
matters,
this
court
and
the
law
have
indicated
that
it
is
not
beyond
the
possibility
for
an
employer
to
sit
down
with
his
employees
and
to
discuss
with
them,
fully
and
frankly,
both
the
advantages
and
the
disadvantages
of
organization
if
he
does
not,
in
so
doing,
either
make
a
promise
of
benefit
to
them
in
exchange
for
whatever
action
they
may
take
or
to
threaten
them
with
reprisal
in
exchange
for
whatever
action
it
takes.so,
we
are
not
here
confined,
as
the
case
might
indicate,
with
solely
the
question
that
he
has
either
got
to
yield
or
go
out
of
business.
and,
again,
i
say,
the
fact
that
an
employer
might
be
inclined
to
violate
the
law
is
applying
a
subjective
test.
it's
applying
a
test
of
the
effectiveness
of
the
picket
line
and
should
not
be
used
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
right
which
is
of
constitutional
rank
is
unlawfully
purposed
or
not.
mr.
david
previant
thank
you.
