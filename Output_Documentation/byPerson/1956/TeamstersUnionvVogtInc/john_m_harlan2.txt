do
we
have
to
pursue
a
study
or
a
motion?
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
it
have
made
any
difference
to
your
case
if
there
had
been
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
union
had
gone
to
the
employer
before
picketing
and
politely,
without
coercion,
without
threat
of
picketing,
said
“we'd
like
to
have
your
shop
organized”?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
would
have
made
a
difference?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
to
see
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
to
test
the
absence
of
that
element
that
you
say
deprives
a
finder
of
the
fact
to
say
that
that
--
we
can
infer
that
from
what
went
on
here.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
you
wanted
to
influence
somebody.
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
there
any
dispute
that
the
union
knew
that
the
effect
of
its
picketing,
whatever
its
purpose
was,
was
to
prevent
your
suppliers
from
coming
across
the
delivery
line,
any
dispute
on
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understand
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
knew
that
their
picket
line
is
being
respected
and
that
you
weren't
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
adversary
said
that
this
morning.
