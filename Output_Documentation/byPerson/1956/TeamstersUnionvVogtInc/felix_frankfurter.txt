justice
felix
frankfurter
in
number,
how
many
were
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
--
would
it
interfere
with
the
course
of
your
intended
argument
if
you
stated
the
difference
between
11
--
111.06
(2)(b)
and
(2)(a)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
and
this
was
found
to
violate
(b)?
i
mean,
on
the
final
rehearing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
the
trial
court
has
found
that
there
was
coercion,
did
it
find
that?
did
it
find
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
it
had
found
that
there
was
coercion,
would
you
be
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
saying
that,
on
the
facts
--
on
the
facts,
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
they
couldn't
have
found
coercion,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
i
bring
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
all
wisconsin
said
that
picketing
in
order
to
coerce
recognition
of
the
union
is
unlawful.
would
that
be
unconstitutional?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
sure
they're
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
sure
they're
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
the
employees.
what
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
action
which
says
picketing
to
coerce
an
employer
to
recognize
a
union
shall
hereafter
be
barred.
would
that
be
unlawful?
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
picketing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
picketing
for?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
your
court
--
i'm
asking
these
questions
because
these
are
very
troublesome
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
my
own
mind
and
in
the
opinion
of
this
court,
they
are
very
troublesome,
in
my
own
mind.
suppose
the
wisconsin
court
had
found
that
this
was
an
effort
by
what
they
found
to
be
coercion
to
get
union
recognition
and
that
wisconsin
law
barred
that.
would
that
be
unconstitutional?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
why
--
i
don't
follow
that
all
that
is
constitutional
but
to
bring
pressure
to
bare
or
what
the
state
would
call
coercion
to
get
union
recognition
would
be
violative
of
the
constitution.
i
don't
follow
that.
i
cannot
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
connect
coercion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
state
law
is
that
you
shouldn't,
by
means
of
picketing,
obtain
that
object.
that's
the
state
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
well,
now,
is
that
unconstitutional?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
this
isn't
--
you're
not
into
that
--
you're
not
attacking
the
validity
of
the
statute
but
whether
these
facts
bring
it
within
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
all
depends
on
the
construction
the
state
court
made
of
the
specific
facts
and
the
allowable
area
of
differences
of
judgment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
with
all
due
respect,
mr.
previant,
i
don't
get
very
far
by
starting
out
with
a
violation
--
with
a
finding
of
a
violation
of
a
constitutional
right.
if
that's
there,
of
course,
that's
an
end
of
the
matter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
troubled
about
is
exactly
what
it
is
you're
asking
us
to
do,
namely,
as
i
understand
it,
you're
asking
us
to
say
there
was
no
warrant
on
undisputed
facts
--
there
was
no
warrant
on
undisputed
facts
and
--
on
the
part
of
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
to
draw
the
inference,
that's
what
this
is,
to
draw
the
inference
that
the
effect
of
this
is
to
compel
to
use
this
means
of
picketing,
this
means
of
gaining
recognition
for
the
union.
that
that
was
a
disallowable
inference
by
the
court,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
right
in
finding
that
this
shifting
position
by
your
supreme
court
took
place
between
june
28th
and
october
5th?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
same
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
cuts
both
ways.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
--
i'm
not
surprised
that
i'm
puzzled
again
because
these
are
tricky
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
these
are
tricky
problems
and
not
your
fault.
but,
here,
the
problem
isn't
--
as
i
understood
from
our
colloquy,
you
recognize
that
the
state
may
make
it
a
state
policy
not
to
bring
what
is
called
the
coercive
influence
of
picketing
to
bear
to
bring
about
a
particular
result.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
your
--
what
i
understood
you
to
indicate
with
the
issue
before
us
is
that
there
is
no
basis
on
this
record
to
warrant
such
a
conclusion
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
bringing
it
within
that
policy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
we
don't
have
to
argue
whether
it's
an
allowable
policy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
is,
wasn't
this
a
baseless
and,
therefore,
an
arbitrary
finding
that
it
did
come
within
the
policy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
a
settled
document
of
this
court,
mr.
previant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
at
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
--
you're
saying
anymore
or
you're
contending
for
anymore
that,
when
we
deal
with
freedom
of
speech,
we
should
go
slow?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
little
bit
more.
all
right,
let's
not
--
this
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
--
see
why
i
should
put
on
you
the
burden
of
difference
of
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
simply
warrant
a
caveat
against
the
notion
that
there
is
a
principle
of
law
that,
presumptively,
things
that
deal
with
freedom
of
speech
have
to
be
justified.
go
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
know,
if
you
put
it
that
way,
then
you
come
out
with
the
result
that
you
want
to
come
out
with.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
you.
i
mean
anyone
who
puts
it
that
way
comes
out
with
that
result.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know
but
there
are
other
things
you
could
quote,
too,
you
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
isn't
semantics
for
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
judgment
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
different
judges
on
the
same
set
of
facts
is
also
something
in
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
court
has
done
that,
too.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and,
maybe
the
later
judgment
is
a
wiser
judgment,
where
it
only
means
just
as
much
to
be
respected.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
would
it
bother
you,
or
maybe
you
have
said
it's
enough
for
your
satisfaction
but
it's
not
enough
for
mine
yet,
to
state
in
summary
what
is
this
evidence
and
then
tell
us
what
effects
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
did
the
placards
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understand
you
to
say,
that
there
was
no
demand
for
any
specific
wages,
hours,
or
conditions
of
employment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that,
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
concerned
merely,
abstractly
stating
it,
i
don't
mean
to
carry
any
implication
myself,
this
concerned
merely
the
absence
of
the
affiliation
of
the
employees
of
this
plant,
of
this
enterprise,
belonged
to
the
union.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
i
mean,
couldn't
anybody
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
was
no
specific
demand
on
the
employer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
in
relation
to
--
i
mean
to
use
the
neutral
phrase.
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
in
relation
to
unionization.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
so
far
as
the
picketing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
as
justice
black
has
developed,
the
picketing
must
have
had
some
purpose.
it
wasn't
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
charivari.
it
wasn't
a
mardi
gras.
it
had
some
industrial
objective,
didn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and,
the
industrial
objective
was
to
get
them
to
join
the
union.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
they
were
--
that
was
their
aim,
to
protect
standards
by
being
a
union.
that's
what
you
and
i
know
to
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
one
of
the
reasons
for
unions,
one
of
the
appropriate
necessary,
from
my
point
of
view,
but
is
that
right,
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
there
was
no
demand
for
any
specific
changes
in
the
conditions
of
employment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
employer,
not
at
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
there
was
just
this
mode
of
communicating
to
whomsoever
it
was
communicated
that
the
employees
in
this
enterprise
didn't
belong
to
the
union.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
forbids
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
forbids
people
to
--
some
members
of
unions
to
invite
others
to
join
publicly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
by
“public”
you
don't
mean
that
--
that
this
is
the
same
thing
as
putting
an
ad
in
the
paper
or
having
a
whole
article
written
by
friendly
people.
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
“public”
do
you
mean
in
this
way,
--
this
public
way?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
questioning
the
public
aspect.
this
is
public
but
so
is
an
ad
in
the
--
in
the
milwaukee
journal
public.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
had
supposed
that
all
members
of
the
court
had
agreed
that
it
isn't
enough
to
say
that
--
that
marching
up
and
down
as
an
abstract
proposition
doesn't
settle
cases.
that
you
may
march
in
such
numbers
or
under
such
circumstances
or
your
placards
may
say
things
which
you
might
say
in
the
newspaper,
and
it
would
be
a
difference.
i
had
supposed
we
all
have
said
that
because
decision
had
been
unanimous
on
that
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we've
all
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
we've
--
we've
outlawed
mass
picketing,
haven't
we,
mr.
previant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that,
already
you
can
claim
marching
is
constitutionally
protected
under
all
circumstances,
have
we?
what
do
you
think
we
have?
what
do
you
think?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
wouldn't
be
here
saying
you
can
have
mass
picketing
under
the
first
amendment,
would
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
all
i'm
suggesting
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
that
the
unlawfulness
may
be
derived
from
conditions
with
reference
to
picketing
which
would
not
be
unlawful
if
in
the
context
of
a
newspaper.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
if
one
says
the
court
has
drawn,
one
means
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
made
it
as
clear
as
i
think
it
can
be
made,
if
i
may
say
so,
mr.
previant,
what
the
very
narrow
and
circumscribed
position
is,
which
you
are
urging
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
excluding
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
excluding
from
your
desire
of
persuasion
everybody
except
the
employer
then.
you're
--
you're
including
only
the
employer
from
your
desire
of
persuasion,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
question
of
the
processes
of
the
human
mind
of
a
decent
piece
of
reasoning
or
is
an
allowable
piece
of
reasoning,
not
decent,
an
allowable.
if
you
say
you
wanted
to
bring
this
knowledge
home
to
the
employees,
to
your
friends,
to
employers
who
have
the
good
sense
to
be
sympathetic
with
unions
that
here
is
a
fellow
who
stupidly
doesn't
have
a
union-shop,
you
wanted
to
bring
this
knowledge
home
to
everybody
except
the
employer
because,
by
the
law
of
wisconsin,
you
can't
bring
it
home
to
the
employer,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
when
one
begins
to
talk
about
violating
law
and
not
violating
in
this
area
when
it's
introducing
what
i
believe
is
an
irrelevant
and
a
dangerous
implication
of
moral
elements
which,
for
me,
aren't
there
at
all.
these
are
very
difficult,
very
subtle,
as
no
one
knows
better
than
you,
issues
in
which
moral
judgments
or
from
which
moral
judgments
ought
to
be
excluded.
these
are
practical
things
and
the
unions
are
in
some
difficulty
and
employers
are
in
difficulty
and,
if
i
may
say
so,
judges
are
in
difficulty
of
knowing
exactly
what
the
law
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
nothing
happened
between
june
and
october
to
enable
them
to
look
for
that
to
forbid
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
he
did?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i'm
not
unaware
of
the
point
you've
just
made
and
that's
made
with
a
good
deal
of
vigor
in
the
amicus
brief.
and,
i
have,
in
my
day,
expressed
my
feeling
on
this
subject.
it
might
need
conviction
which
has
been
changed,
and
we're
dealing
here
with
a
very
narrow
question
of
constitutionality,
as
i
need
not
tell
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
page
30
of
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean,
the
employer
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
the
employees
coerced
the
employer
to
coerce
his
employees.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
as
i
understand
it,
the
sign
between
you
and
your
adversary
here
is
very
narrow
there.
they
say
that
no
evidence
at
all
which
you
can
find
that
their
purpose
was
to
coerce
the
employer
to
coerce
the
employees.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
say
if
that
evidence
is
there,
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
have
a
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
the
question
as
to
whether
there
was
any
evidence
from
which
that
could
be
found.of
course,
in
a
given
a
case,
we
have
very
strong
evidence
to
show
not
only
a
purpose
to
violate
the
law,
but
a
constant
continuing
violation
of
the
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
everything
it
was
said
on
the
placards
and
everywhere
else,
he
says
here
there
is
no
evidence
of
that
kind
on
which
there
could
rationally
be
a
finding
that
there
was
a
purpose
here
to
coerce
the
employer
to
coerce
the
employees.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
a
wisconsin
statute
which
makes
it
illegal
for
one
person
to
try
to
persuade
another
not
to
do
business
with
the
third?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
asking,
the
court
doesn't
seem
to
have
relied
on
any
statute
which
makes
it
illegal
for
one
person
trying
to
persuade
another
person
not
to
do
business
with
a
third
person.
do
you
have
such
a
law
in
wisconsin?
they
have
not
relied
on
any
such
law
and
i'm
just
--
that
seems
to
be
your
main
reliance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and,
yet,
there
is
that
against
the
law
of
wisconsin.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
the
peaceful
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
relying
on
any
statute
as
making
this
conduct,
this
particular
piece
of
conduct
to
which
you
prefer
--
refer,
having
a
picket
line
there
that
others
would
not
cross,
are
you
relying
on
a
particular
statute
which
makes
that
unlawful?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
do
--
do
you
have
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
have
any
statute
which
makes
it
unlawful,
to
--
for
--
either
a
picket
line
or
any
other
way,
for
one
person
to
try
to
persuade
another
not
to
go
into
a
place
of
business.
you
--
the
court
hasn't
relied
on
any.
it's
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
are
you
able
to
say
that
what
happened
here,
let's
assume
that
they
would
not
cross
the
picket
line,
are
you
able
to
point
to
any
wisconsin
statute
or
any
wisconsin
opinion
which
makes
that
unlawful
under
wisconsin
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
then
that
you
are
arguing
now
that,
although
wisconsin
has
no
statute
against
this
and
has
never
said
that
it's
against
the
law,
it
can
nevertheless
be
used
as
an
implication
to
deprive
people
of
the
right
of
advertising
the
facts
of
a
labor
dispute
or
that
--
to
try
to
persuade
to
join
the
union.
justice
felix
frankfurter
imply
a
violation
of
some
other
law
in
the
fact
that
they
do
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
see
if
i
understand
the
course
this
argument
is
taking.
as
i
understand
you,
you
say
you
support
the
wisconsin
decision
on
rehearing
because
they
found
that
this
was
a
violation
of
section
(b).
justice
felix
frankfurter
and,
mr.
previant
says
he
recognizes
the
validity
of
section
(b)
but
he
says
there's
no
warrant
in
this
record
for
having
made
such
a
finding.
isn't
that
the
clash
of
the
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
--
have
you
available,
you
and
mr.
previant
or
mr.
previant,
have
you
available
the
briefs?
were
there
printed
briefs
which
preceded
this
kind
of
a
rehearing
before
the
wisconsin
supreme
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
briefs
filed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
briefs
filed
--
were
printed
briefs
filed
before
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
preceded
and,
perhaps,
led
to
the
grant
of
the
rehearing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
were
printed
briefs?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you,
with
the
chief
justice's
permission,
file
those
briefs?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
mr.
previant
have
a
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
were
such
briefs?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
leave
them
with
the
clerk?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
that
be
done
quickly,
mr.
bernheim?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
will
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
we'll
have
--
we'll
have
to
make
do
with
one,
if
you
have
that.
i
would
like
to
see
the
briefs
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
came
before
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
say,
i
am
cheered
by
the
suggestion
that,
in
wisconsin,
the
atmosphere
is
such
that
that's
a
reasonable
expectation
on
the
part
of
the
employer.
