justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question
to
get
myself
clear.
you
say
the
only
thing
we
have
to
consider
here
is
whether
there
was
any
right
to
draw
an
inference
that
this
statute
was
violated,
number
111.06
(2)(b).
you
--
you
agree
that
the
statute
is
valid
in
saying
that
there
can
be
no
picketing
to
coerce,
intimidate,
or
induce
an
employer
to
interfere
with
his
employees
in
enjoyment
of
their
legal
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
quarrel?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and,
you
say
your
only
quarrel
is
that
they
found
the
statute
was
violated
with
inadequate
inferences
--
inadequate
evidence
to
support
the
inferences.
in
what
is
it
short,
do
you
say?
do
you
say
there's
no
evidence
to
show
that
they
coerced,
there's
no
evidence
to
show
that
they
intimidated,
no
evidence
to
show
the
purpose
to
induce,
or
that
there's
a
failure
to
show
that
the
purpose
was
to
interfere
with
some
of
the
employees
in
enjoyment
of
their
legal
rights?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
one?
now,
what
isn't
shown
here?
what
does
it
fail
to
show?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
that
the
purpose
to
compel
an
employee
to
--
by
coercion,
intimidation,
or
inducement
to
interfere
with
the
employee's
right
to
do
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and,
that's
your
whole
basis
of
your
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
your
point,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
demand?
does
it
show?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
was
--
was
anything
more
enjoined
in
the
marching
around?
what
--
what
is
enjoined?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
on
a
highway,
was
that
on
a
street
or
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
did
they
do,
marched
backwards
and
forward
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
running
around
or
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
against
the
law
in
wisconsin
or
are
they
held
as
against
the
law
to
march
backwards
and
forwards
on
the
highway?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
say
is
that
the
whole
evidence
is
that
they
marched
backwards
and
forwards.
they
had
placards?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
against
the
law
of
wisconsin
or
is
it
claimed
to
be
against
the
law
of
wisconsin
to
march
backwards
and
forwards
with
placards?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
what
did
the
placards
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
all
they
ever
had
on
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
evidence
or
any
agreement
that
they
ever
said
anything
else
to
the
employer,
except
what
was
said
--
employer,
except
what
was
said
on
the
placard?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
court
point
out
in
what
way
that
coerced,
intimidated,
or
induced
them
to
do
that,
or
what
is
the
argument
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
that
--
is
that
included
in
this
--
what
the
statute
forbid?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what
is
with
reference
to
the
particular
thing
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
seeing
or
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
intimidating
the
employer
further
to
get
him
to
do
it.
i
don't
know
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
would
be
to
compel
them
to
join
a
union
they
didn't
belong
or
wanted
to
belong
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
you
are
saying
then
in
effect
is,
isn't
it,
that
they
have
construed
their
state
statute
on
the
facts
of
this
case
in
forbidding
members
of
the
union
to
advertise
the
fact
that
they
want
people
working
there
to
join
the
union?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and,
if
that's
the
--
you
are
saying
that
if
a
statute
were
written
out
in
that
language,
as
the
way
they
have
applied
it,
that
it
would
violate
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
they
hadn't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
they
had
put
in
the
statute
here
that
it
shall
be
unlawful
against
the
law
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
for
men
to
invite
other
people
to
join
the
union
and
to
publicize
that
fact,
what
would
that
statute
violate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
your
claim
here,
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
claim
is,
as
i
understand
it,
from
what
you
said,
the
evidence
shows
they
did
no
more
than
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
therefore,
they've
applied
the
statute
in
such
a
way
that
it
makes
it
unlawful
for
men
to
invite
others
to
join
the
union,
privately
or
publicly?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but,
if
the
court
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
the
court
construes
it
as
meaning
that,
we
would
be
bound
by
the
state's
construction
of
the
meaning
of
its
own
statute.
what
you're
saying
is
our
understanding
is
that
that
statute
as
applied
by
them,
meaning
that
they
interpret
it
to
authorize
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
want
to
get
around
to
what
a
labor
dispute
is
when
you
are
saying
that,
here,
they
have
forbidden,
maybe
you're
right
or
wrong
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that,
under
the
facts
here,
you
--
they
have
to
limit
what
they
are
saying
here
that
it's
unlawful
in
wisconsin
for
union
men
to
invite
others
to
join
the
union
publicly.
justice
hugo
l.
black
whatever
way
they've
done
it,
is
that
what
you're
claiming
they've
done?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
has
this
court
held
otherwise,
in
what
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
has,
left
and
right,
where
it's
lawful
to
march
backwards
and
forwards
or
where
a
person
could
be
that
is
less
lawful
for
him
to
invite
somebody
to
join
a
union
under
those
circumstances.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
of
course,
some
members
of
the
court
have
drawn
a
difference
between
marching
backwards
and
forwards
as
an
element
of
picketing
and
publicity.
and,
here,
you
say
that
aside
from
the
one
thing
which
has
been
found,
which
you
say
is
not
supported,
it's
perfectly
lawful
to
march
up
and
down
in
front
of
their
bills.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
think
i've
ever
said
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
doesn't
know
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
a
distinction
which
i
said,
“i
haven't
drawn.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
say,
if
what.
i
didn't
quite
get
your
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
haven't
argued
that
yet
before.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
you
are
arguing
--
