justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
previant,
may
i
ask
just
this
one
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
make
reference
or,
perhaps
i
have
to
put
it
this
way,
is
there
any
finding
that
this
picketing
was
purposed
to
shutoff
deliveries
to
the
employer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
any
finding
that
this
picketing
was
purposed,
in
part
at
least,
to
shutoff
deliveries
to
the
employer
because
the
operators
of
vehicles
and
members
of
the
same
picketing
union
would
not
cross
the
picketing
line?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
follow
what
you
mean
by
conclusion.
is
that
to
say
it
was
not
a
finding
but
something
else?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
let's
--
let's
suppose
it
could
have
been
drawn.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then,
what
would
your
position
be?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
what
other
--
what
i
gather
--
i
understood
you
to
mean
by
conclusion
or
signal
or
whatever
the
word
is,
that,
in
that
way,
pressure
was
exerted
upon
the
employer,
which
i
think
you
said
earlier
would
be
unlawful
pressure,
to
induce
his
employees
to
join
this
union
so
that
the
normal
operations
of
the
business
could
resume.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
what
i
want
to
get
to
--
what
i
want
to
get
to
is
if,
in
fact,
this
picketing
was
in
part
purposed
to
shutoff
deliveries
to
this
employer
and
so
affect
the
conduct
of
its
business
that
it
would,
in
an
effort
to
relieve
itself,
put
pressure
on
the
employees
to
join
this
union.
would
you
have
a
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
on
that
hypothesis,
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
would
you
have
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
a
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
course,
if
you
had
taken
the
newspaper
advertisements
or
had
an
article
written,
you
probably
would
not
have
accomplished
shutting
off
deliveries
to
this
employer,
would
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
suppose
there
had
not
been
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
there
had
not
been
--
this
isn't
my
first
day
in
this
chair,
and
maybe
this
doesn't
work.
suppose
there
had
not
been
these
conduct
of
trucks
refusing
to
cross
the
picket
line.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
have
had
a
case?
