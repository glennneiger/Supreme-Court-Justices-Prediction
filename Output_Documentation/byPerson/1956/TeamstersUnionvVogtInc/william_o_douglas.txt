well,
that
would
be
true
of
any
picket
line,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
so,
why
do
you
say
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
you
just
say
that
the
--
the
existence
of
a
picket
line
itself
is
not
to
bring
coercion
on
the
employer.
what
happens
to
cases
like
swing
and
the
others
where
we
upheld
picketing?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
understand.
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
court
found
that
the
purpose
was
to
coerce
the
employer.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
say
if
you
can
infer
that
just
from
the
mere
fact
of
picketing,
why
--
why
can't
you
infer
it
in
every
case
what
this
picket
line
has
shown?
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
kind
of
a
case
would
you
say
would
be
saying
the
doctrine
that
you
are
arguing
before
was
adopted?
when
would
you
think
it
would
be
permissible?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
your
argument
would
outlaw
all
organizational
picketing.
