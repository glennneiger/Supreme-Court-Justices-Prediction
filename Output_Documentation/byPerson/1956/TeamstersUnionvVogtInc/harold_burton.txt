was
there
any
controversy
about
that
fact
about
the
number
of
people
that
passed
and
that
the
location
of
this
area,
any
dispute
about
it
on
--
from
the
other
side?
justice

but
do
you
say
that
to
place
this
picket
line
amounts
to
having
that
effect
because
it
coerces
the
people
or
it
coerces
the
employer
by
placing
the
picket
line
and
cutting
off
his
deliveries?
justice
harold
burton
that's
right.

therefore,
you
say
that
the
placing
of
the
picket
line
there
tantamount
to
a
violation
of
section
(b)
because
it
does
amount
to
automatic
effects
on
these
liberals
to
coerce
the
employer?
