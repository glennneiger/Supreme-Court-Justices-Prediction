mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
if
the
court
please,
i
would
like
to
just
--
for
the
enlightenment
of
the
court,
restate
a
few
things
about
the
pleading
and
the
manner
of
disposing
of
the
case
on
the
pleading.
and,
i
should
like
--
what
i
think
of
it,
mr.
justice
brennan,
to
say
to
you
that
the
court
--
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
which
determined
that
it
had
the
power
to
make
findings
of
its
own
on
a
record
of
this
kind,
where
there
was
no
oral
testimony,
did
find
in
effect
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
picketing
was
to
cut
off
the
transportation
facilities
of
the
employer.
i
may
call
your
attention
to
page
35
of
the
transcript
on
that
point.
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
the
court
says,
this
is
its
second
opinion,
“the
question
then
arises
whether
the
defendants
violated
section
111.06
(2)(m)
of
the
statute
and,
thereby,
engaged
in
picketing
for
an
unlawful
purpose.
the
trial
court
refused
to
find
as
plaintiff
requested
that
the
picketing
on
plaintiff's
premises
had
been
engaged
in
for
the
purpose
of
coercing,
and
so
forth,
to
become
members
of
the
defendant
labor
organization
and
for
the
purpose
of
injuring
the
plaintiff
in
his
business
of
his
refusal
to,
in
anyway,
interfere
with
the
rights
of
his
employees
to
join
or
not
to
join
a
labor
organization.”
they
go
on
to
say
here,
“we
are
of
the
opinion
that
the
finding
should
have
been
made
picketing
may
be
more
than
free
speech
when
it
is
conducted
as
it
was
in
this
instance,
upon
a
rural
highway
at
the
entrance
to
a
gravel
pit
for
an
exceedingly
small
number
of
possible
or
probable
patrons
of
the
owner's
business
might
pass
and
be
influenced
by
the
union's
banner.
it
is
more
than
the
mere
exercise
of
the
right
of
free
communication.”
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
in
the
record,
yes.
there
was
a
finding
by
the
trial
court
that
the
truckers
refused
to
deliver
or
take
away
materials
and
things
that
were
needed
in
the
business.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
there
are
allegations
in
the
complaint,
if
your
honor
please.
which
--
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
which
i
think
support
that
position
entirely.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
no,
they
were
not
controverted,
not
in
any
manner
of
shape
or
form.
we
must
remember,
if
you
please,
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
undoubtedly
took
judicial
notice
of
the
situation
which
was
existing
here
with
reference
to
the
geography
of
the
state.
the
premises
in
which
this
gravel
pit
was
conducted
were
described
by
meets
and
bounds
as
in
the
town
and
readily
intelligent
to
the
supreme
court
judges
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
as
to
what
the
locus
in
court
was,
and
that
is
taking
into
consideration
in
their
making
these
various
findings
which
they
themselves
made
as
a
result
of
the
motion
and
argument
on
the
rehearing.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
no,
there
is
--
there
is
no
direct
evidence
on
that
point.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
well,
i
think
they
arrived
at
that
finding,
mr.
chief
justice,
upon
their
own
knowledge
of
the
situation
as
it
existed
in
that
locus
because
that
is
a
sort
of
a
trunk
--
county
trunk
road,
off
even
the
--
off
the
main
highway
and
is
in
a
distinctly
rural
situation
where
it
is
not
used
by
persons
who
are
normally
engaged
in
business
back
and
forth.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
my
only
answer
to
that
is,
and
was
indicated
a
moment
ago,
i
think
that
they
--
they
knew
what
the
situation
there
was,
just
as
i
--
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
--
knew
what
the
--
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
i
am
very
positive
that,
while
they
didn't
have
any
direct
evidence
on
the
subject
because
of
the
number
of
people
that
might
pass
there,
that
they
were
surely
conversant
with
that
site
in
the
rural
district
in
which
it
was
located.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
well,
let
me
say
this
in
answer
to
that.
you
say
could
and
i
say
they
did.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
yes.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
and,
if
you
take
that
into
consideration
as
only
one
of
the
elements
which
led
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
came
to
in
the
--
in
the
second
opinion,
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
no.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
i
don't
remember
that
it
was
disputed.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
i
don't
remember
that
it
was
disputed.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
it
was
disputed.
may
i
--
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
well,
that's
true.
that's
true.
may
i
just
call
your
attention
on
page
30
of
the
transcript.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
page
30
of
the
transcript.
i
would
like
to,
if
i
may,
read
just
what
the
court
said
in
the
first
paragraph
of
its
opinion
to
indicate
to
your
honors
here
the
basis
upon
which
it
made
the
final
holding
in
this
case.
we
have
concluded
that
we
were
in
error
in
our
original
determination
of
the
issues
in
this
case
and,
therefore,
withdraw
the
opinion
on
the
mandate
previously
entered.
we
are
convinced
that,
in
our
study
of
the
issues
presented,
we
gave
too
little
consideration
to
the
fact
that
there
are
limitations
upon
the
right
of
free
speech
and
that
the
prohibition
of
action
against
free
speech
is
not
intended
to
give
immunity
for
every
use
or
abuse
of
language.
we
gave
him
sufficient
notice
to
the
fact
that
free
speech
is
not
the
only
right
secured
by
our
fundamental
law
and
that
it
must
weighed
here,
for
instance,
against
the
equally
important
right
to
engage
in
a
legitimate
business,
free
from
dictation
by
an
outside
group
of
the
right
to
protection
against
unlawful
conduct
which
will
or
may
result
in
a
destruction
of
a
business,
that
both
the
right
to
labor
and
the
right
to
carry
on
business
are
liberty
in
property.
we
left
out
of
calculation
the
rule
that
the
court
is
to
consider
not
only
the
established
facts,
as
they
appear
in
the
record,
but
that
it
should
also
give
attention
to
the
inferences
reasonably
and
justifiably
to
be
drawn
there
from.
now,
in
connection
with
that,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
you
in
a
sort
of
an
itemized
way
the
different
elements
that
entered
into
the
court's
conclusions
and
those
are
contained
on
page
49
of
our
brief.
it
sums
up
the
bases,
the
factual
bases
upon
which
the
court
came
to
this
conclusion.
the
title
of
--
the
title
is
the
right
to
engage
in
a
lawful
business
free
from
outside
interference
is
also
a
constitutionally
--
is
constitutionally
protected.
when
the
supreme
court
handed
down
its
second
opinion
upon
rehearing,
it
recited
the
following
principles
among
others
which,
in
part,
have
motivated
it
to
reverse
its
first
decision
and
to
which
it
had
previously
given
too
little
consideration.
and,
those
are
the
facts
which
i
call
to
your
honor's
attention
to
in
the
beginning
of
the
decision.
there
are
some
other
considerations
which
commence
with
(e)
on
page
49
that,
in
considering
the
right
of
freedom
of
speech,
it
must
be
recognized
that
the
right
is
to
be
evaluated
with
the
right
of
the
many
who
have
no
interest
whatsoever
in
the
relationship
between
the
defendant
union
and
those
who
may
seek
to
acquire
as
members.
that,
by
its
very
nature,
every
right
is
related
to
a
duty
to
exercise
so
as
to
cause
a
minimum
of
harm
to
another,
least
of
all
to
an
innocent
bystander,
that
the
right
of
freedom
of
speech
may
not
be
considered
a
part
from
that
of
society
to
maintain
order,
that
when
one
who
seeks
freedom
--
that
one
who
seeks
freedom
may
not
wholly
ignore
his
neighbor's
right
to
it.
now,
we
have
had
quite
a
lot
of
controversy
in
the
labor
relations
and
in
the
legal
actions
that
flow
from
them
about
recognition
picketing
and
organizational
picketing.
some
inquiry
from,
i
think,
mr.
justice
clark
--
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
well,
it
was
directed
to
that
point
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
difference
between
picketing
which
results
from
a
demand
upon
the
employer
to
recognize
it
as
a
bargaining
agent
and
picketing
which
is
indulged
in
without
any
demand
or
communication
between
the
union
and
the
employer.
there
has
never
--it
has
never
seemed
to
me
that
there
is
any
difference
in
that
kind
of
an
approach
because
the
objectives,
whether
it
is
so-called
recognition
picketing
or
so-called
organizational
picketing,
is
the
same,
namely,
to
achieve
a
status
whereby
the
union
gets
the
representation
for
the
employees
involved
and
proceeds
along
the
normal
lines
of
the
sequence
of
union
representation
to
attempt
to
get
some
kind
of
a
collective
bargaining
contract.
now,
what
was
the
employer
here,
under
the
law
of
wisconsin,
up
against,
regardless
of
whether
this
was
organizational
picketing
or
recognition
picketing?
our
statutes
provides,
the
wisconsin
employment
peace
act
which
have
been
before
this
court
a
good
many
times
in
other
cases,
that
it
shall
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
an
employer
to
bargain
with
the
representatives
of
employees
who
do
not
represent
the
majority.
if
this
union
had
come
to
the
employer
in
this
case,
not
representing
a
majority,
and
the
employer
would
have
bargained
with
it,
he
would
have
been
guilty
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
wisconsin.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
if
an
employer,
mr.
justice
black,
bargains
with
a
union,
it
does
not
represent
a
majority
of
the
employees
involved
in
the
union,
he
is
guilty
of
an
unfair
labor
practice.
now,
obviously,
this
employer
must
have
known
that
this
union
didn't,
in
any
manner,
represent
the
majority
of
the
employees,
so
that
if
he
had
even
desired
to
bargain,
he
would
have
been
guilty
of
an
unfair
labor
practice.
now,
what
was
the
other
alternative
for
him
to
do?
he
was
confronted
with
the
picketing
which
had
the
same
effect
the
moment
that
picketing
--
the
picket
was
placed
there,
it
had
the
same
effect
upon
his
business
situation
as
a
home,
a
house,
would
have
if
you
put
a
sign
on
the
door,
there
is
a
hysteria
here.
there
is
no
difference
from
the
moment
that
that
picket
got
there,
as
far
as
this
company
was
concerned,
as
to
deliveries
of
supplies
in
and
finished
product
out,
it
was
quarantined.
you
must
remember
that
we
have
here
the
teamsters
union.
the
teamsters
union,
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
was
perfectly
legitimate
for
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin,
if
it
did
so,
to
take
judicial
notice
of
hot
cargo
clauses,
anti-picket
crossing
line
clauses.
the
employer
was,
from
the
time
that
that
picket
was
placed
there,
cut
off
from
the
proper
conduct
of
his
business.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
that
would
be
true
of
any
picket
line.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
yes,
but
--
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
they
claim
they
weren't
--
mr.
justice
douglas,
they
claim
they
were
not
picketing
this
employer.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
there
was
no
dispute
here
between
the
employer
and
the
--
and
these
three
unions.
they
claim
that
they
were
there
for
the
purpose
of
influencing
the
employees.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
that
--
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
yes,
the
court
found
that.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
well,
i
think
there
are
a
good
many
cases
--
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
do
you
mean,
when
a
picketing
would
be
permissible?
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
well,
i
think
it
would
be
permissible
in
any
controversy
between
an
employer
and
a
union
where
the
objective
of
the
union
was
lawful
such
as
wages,
hours,
and
working
condition
or
any
facet,
lawful
facet.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
under
the
wisconsin
statute,
and
i
think
it
should
be.
i
think,
here,
you
yourself,
in
one
or
two
opinions
and
some
of
your
writings,
have
indicated
the
--
that
picketing
is
per
se
more
than
freedom
of
speech.
that
it
has
coercive
elements
in
it
which
distinguish
it
from
freedom
of
speech
and
make
it
something
considerably
more.
and,
now,
what
happened
here,
if
your
honors
please,
was
a
realistic
dramatization
of
modern
labor
relation.
it
is
all
right
to
use
the
word
“peaceful
picketing”
and
“peaceful
persuasion.”
that
it
is
all
right
to
use
the
word
“organizational
picketing”
or
“recognition
picketing”
to
distinguish
between
certain
rights
which
are
conceived
by
some
courts
and
some
writers
and
conceived
by
more
courts
and
more
writers
not
to
have
any
difference.
but,
here
was
a
drama
that
was
actually
taking
place.
the
actions
in
it
spoke
louder
than
the
words.
they
had
--
contrary
to
counsel's
statement,
the
union
had
been,
for
over
a
period
of
a
year,
at
various
intervals,
doing
their
best,
i
presume,
as
the
fact
show
here,
to
persuade
these
employees
to
join
the
union.
and,
these
employees,
as
the
trial
court
expressly
found,
the
express
finding
had
no
--
had
no
desire
and
made
that
manifest
for
the
union
to
join
the
union.
now,
the
arts,
the
very
keystone,
of
the
wisconsin
employment
peace
act
is
the
freedom
of
employee
choice,
and
all
the
allegations
and
all
the
unfair
labor
practices
which
are
set
out
in
that
act,
and
there
are
many
of
them,
both
on
the
part
of
employees
and
the
unions
and
on
the
part
of
employer,
are
designed
to
protect
that
freedom
of
--
freedom
of
choice
on
the
part
of
the
employee,
whether
or
not
they
want
to
be
members
of
a
union
or
whether
or
not
they
don't
want
to
be
a
member
of
a
union.
and,
one
of
the
unfair
labor
practices
on
the
part
of
employees
is
that,
where
the
employees
exert
pressure
upon
the
employer
to
exert
pressure
upon
the
employee
--
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
--
to
join
--
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
that's
right.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
well,
mr.
--
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
that's
right.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
that's
right.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
found
that
that
was
one
of
the
purposes.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
that's
right.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
well,
the
mere
stationing
of
the
picket
under
the
circumstances
and
facts
which
exist
in
this
case
show
that
purpose.
there
isn't
any
escape
from
it.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
yes?
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
well,
that's
a
very
interesting
question.
i
would
say
that,
under
the
circumstances
of
the
locus
in
call
and
all
the
facts
which
the
graham
actually
revealed
that
i
simply
would
have
had
a
case
even
without
that
because
there
would
have
been
some
kind
of
pressure
by
the
mere
stationing
of
that
picket,
their
indication
to
the
employer's
premises
on
the
part
of
the
employer
to
exercise
some
influence
on
the
employees
to
sign
up,
so
to
speak.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
did
the
union
dispute
that?
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
i
don't
think
they
disputed
it,
but
they
disputed
the
motive
or
purpose.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
yes.
they
didn't
dispute
that
--
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
well,
but
--
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
we
are
in
a
modern
world
and
we
all
know
how
those
things
operate.
and,
we
all
know,
i
say
it
without
fear
of
contradiction,
that
where
the
teamsters
union
is
involved
and
maybe
even
where
it
isn't
involved,
the
stationing
of
that
picket
is
a
message
to
its
members,
under
conditions
which
may
result
in
sanction,
not
to
cross
that
picket
line
and
it's
invariably
observed.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
now,
here
is
a
--
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
may
i
ask
you
to
repeat
that
question.
i
didn't
quite
hear
it.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
well,
we
have
a
--
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
we
have
a
criminal
statute
in
wisconsin
which
makes
it
a
crime
to
injure
a
person
in
the
conduct
of
his
business
--
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
--
by
--
i
can't
say
that
directly,
in
answer
to
that,
that
the
mere
attempt
to
persuade
a
person
not
to
do
business
with
another
person
is
a
crime.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
but
to
hinder
--
to
hinder
the
pursuit
--
it's
called
“to
hinder
the
pursuit
of
lawful
business,”
and
i
know
that
if
two
or
more
people
get
together
for
that
purpose,
that
they're
violating
a
criminal
statute
of
wisconsin.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
no.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
we
don't
have
any
particular
statute
which
makes
crossing
a
picket
line
unlawful
or
--
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
i
--
i
think,
if
my
recollection
serves
me
correctly,
although
i
didn't
know
that
was
coming
up
and
perhaps
i'm
not
as
well
prepared
on
that,
i
do
think
we
have
a
statute
which
makes
it
a
criminal
offense
under
some
conditions
to
attempt
to
persuade
a
person
not
to
do
business
with
another
person.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
no,
i
can't.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
well,
mr.
justice
burton,
the
employer
is
between
the
devil
and
the
deep
blue
sea.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
he
either
has
to
forego
the
permissible
conduct
of
his
business,
otherwise,
or
somehow
or
another
make
peace
with
the
union
when
the
union's
objective,
as
they
claim,
was
not
against
him.
he
can't
survive
unless
he
gets
protection
from
what
is,
to
my
mind,
from
my
experience
and
observation
and
understanding,
the
obvious
purpose
of
putting
that
picket
there,
no
matter
what,
in
semantics,
the
unions
may
say
is
not
that
purpose.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
i
would
say
so.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
well,
yes,
i
did.
i
had
a
question
--
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
--
from
mr.
justice
brennan
along
those
lines
in
which
he
said,
“had
this
failure
to
get
transportation
not
taking
place,
would
you
still
say
that
the
placing
of
that
picket
was
unlawful?”
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
and,
i
answered
yes,
i
think.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
well
--
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
because
picketing
is
more
than
advertising.
it
has
elements
in
it
which
are
commonly
understood
by
a
man
on
the
street
that
there
is
some
kind
of
a
coercive
force
resulting
from
the
placing
of
a
picket
and
especially
under
circumstances
like
this.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
that's
right.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
i
think
that's
right.
we
come
here
with
the
findings
of
a
court
of
high
standing
recognized
all
over
the
country.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
pardon
me,
i
--
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
--
didn't
put
that
quote
in
my
motion.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
yes.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
yes,
i
have
it
here.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
yes.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
you
mean
--
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
you
mean
briefs
in
support
and
against
the
motion
for
rehearing?
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
yes,
i
have
--
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
--
i
have
a
copy
here.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
certainly,
i
have
only
one
copy
here.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
do
you
--
how
many
copy
do
you
desire?
i
don't
know
whether
we
have
enough
--
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
--
to
make.
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
well,
i'll
leave
it
with
the
clerk,
--
mr.
leon
b.
lamfrom
--
the
one
that
i
have
here.
i
just
want
to
press
upon
your
honors,
although
i
know
the
question
of
facts
that
is
here,
that
the
wisconsin
has
never
been
a
laggard
in
social
and
economic
progress
and
in
the
progress
of
labor
relations,
legislation
and
judicial
decisions
which
have
for
their
purpose,
generally
speaking,
of
bringing
about
industrial
peace
and
economic
justice.
this
act
says
that
labor
relation
constitute
a
three-way
street,
that
they
employ
--
impose
obligations
and
duties
and
confer
privileges
on
employees,
unions,
and
employers
and,
upon
those
two
elements
in
labor
relations,
to
serve
the
interest
of
the
public.
and,
i
repeat
again
that
the
safeguard
that
is
in
that
labor
relations
act
or
in
the
wisconsin
employment
peace
act
is
the
fact
that
the
right
of
the
employee
to
choose
to
join
a
union
or
not
to
join
a
union
is
the
whole
keystone
of
the
act,
and
that
any
party
to
the
labor
relationship
that,
in
any
manner,
tries
to
intimidate,
coerce,
induce,
or
force
in
any
manner
an
employee
to
make
a
choice
against
his
will
is
guilty
of
an
unfair
labor
practice.
