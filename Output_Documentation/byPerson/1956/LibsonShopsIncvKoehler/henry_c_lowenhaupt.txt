mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
glad
to
move
now
from
a
somewhat
tempestuous
area
of,
maybe,
karl
--
karl
marx
to
that
which
may
be
a
little
calmer,
the
sphere
of
adam
smith.
this
case
involves
a
question
of
the
taxation
of
income
that
comes
to
this
court
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
the
precise
question
presented
is
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
here,
the
surviving
corporation
in
a
merger,
may
carry
over
and
deduct
from
its
income
the
operating
losses
of
three
corporations
which
were
a
component
corporations
in
that
merger.
the
facts
are
stipulated,
fully
set
out
in
the
briefs,
maybe
summarized
very
briefly
here.
prior
to
1949,
there
were
17
corporations,
each
with
the
name
libson
as
part
of
its
name.
some
of
them
were
missouri
corporations,
some
of
them
were
illinois
corporations.
they
conducted
retail
business
in
16
locations.
the
17th
corporation
was
a
management
company.
the
stock
of
all
the
corporations
was
owned
by
the
same
individuals
in
identical
proportions
with
one
nsignificant
exception,
that
one
of
the
corporations
was
the
wholly-owned
subsidiary
of
another
corporation.
that
of
course
doesn't
vary
the
substantial
ownership
of
the
corporations,
all
of
which
were
owned
in
the
same
proportions,
add
identically.
three
of
these
corporations
sustained
net
operating
losses.
at
the
end
of
the
fiscal
year
in
1949,
all
of
the
corporations
were
merged
into
one
corporation
under
the
statutory
provisions
of
the
missouri
and
illinois
corporation
loss
of
the
states
to
their
incorporation.
petitioner
here
is
the
sole
surviving
corporation
in
that
merger.
of
course,
the
fact
that
there
were
17
corporations
doesn't
mean
that
there
were
17
separate
businesses.
there
were
17
accounting
units
conducting
business
at
16
locations
under
one
common
management.
this
appears
to
be
but
one
business.
basically,
the
fact
that
it
was
one
business
is
the
reason
for
the
merger.
this
petitioner
deducted
from
its
income
consisting
of
the
income
of
all
the
locations.
for
the
year
following
the
merger,
the
net
operating
loss
suffered
in
three
of
those
locations
which
appeared
in
the
accounts
of
its
component
corporation,
three
of
its
component
corporations.
and
the
only
question
presented
here
is
the
propriety
of
that
deduction.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
no,
as
new
locations
were
opened
from
time
to
time,
new
corporations
were
formed.
many
of
them
were
organized
at
once
succeeding
to
a
--
a
business
conducted
as
sole
proprietorship.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
no.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
no,
no.
one
corporation
was
the
wholly-owned
subsidiary
of
one
other
corporation.
other
than
that,
there
were
16
corporations
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
were
the
same
individuals,
individual
shareholders.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
each
--
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
that's
right.
all
owning
it
in
the
same
proportions.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
yes.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
were
now
three
but
the
precise
number
makes
no
difference.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
as
new
retail
locations
were
established.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
from
time
to
time,
yes.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
however,
on
the
original
formation
of
the
business,
as
i
understand
it,
there
were
several
incorporated,
four
locations
previously
conducted.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
there
was
no
reason
in
corporate
law.
the
reason
was
based
probably
on
business
judgment,
desirability
of
limiting
liability
in
a
new
least
similar
considerations.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
apparently,
and
the
merger
occurred
probably
for
the
reason
that
it
was
desired
to
have
better
credits
than
a
single
corporation
could
sustain.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
they
all
sell
the
same
product
and
operate
under
common
management.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
yes.
the
management
corporation
so
called.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
did
the
buying
and
management.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
none
was
manufacturing.
as
to
the
motivations
which
led
both
to
the
separate
incorporation
and
to
the
merger,
those
have
never
been
an
issue.
other
sections
of
the
statute
are
addressed
to
various
kinds
of
transfer
acquisitions,
and
the
like,
with
particular
motivations.
the
application
of
those
sections
has
never
been
asserted,
and
therefore,
the
motivations
have
never
become
a
direct
issue
in
this
case,
specifically
section
129
applies
with
some
--
when
certain
motivations
are
present.
that
section
hasn't
been
alleged,
hasn't
been
asserted,
and
therefore,
the
motives
have
not
become
immaterial.
this
case
then
becomes
a
purely
classic
case.
17
corporations
merged
into
one
corporation
which
seeks
to
deduct
the
loss
of
some
of
the
predecessor
corporations.
now,
the
pertinent
statute,
the
case
arises
under
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939,
section
23.
"in
computing
that
income,
there
shall
be
allowed
as
deductions,
the
net
operating
loss
deduction
computed
under
section
122."
section
122,
"if
for
any
taxable
year,
the
taxpayer
has
a
net
operating
loss,
such
net
operating
loss
shall
be
a
net
operating
loss
carry-over
for
each
of
the
three
succeeding
taxable
years."
the
question
of
the
deductibility
of
the
net
operating
loss
in
this
case
involves
only
the
effect
of
the
statutory
merger
of
the
17
corporate
--
component
corporations
on
the
carry-over
of
the
loss
of
the
three
of
them.
no
question
is
raised
here
on
any
other
aspect
of
that
deduction.
now,
the
statute
which
i
have
just
quoted
appears
to
mean
clearly
that
the
loss
may
be
carried
over.
the
only
objection
made
to
that
result
in
this
case
is
that
petitioner
has
now
constituted
--
differs
in
some
respect
from
the
corporations
which
had
the
net
operating
losses
and
may
pause
only
to
note
that
the
statute
does
not
state
any
requirement
if
the
person
seeking
the
deduction
must
be
the
same
person
who
suffered
the
loss.
that
the
identification
of
the
person
entitled
to
the
deduction
was
not
a
matter
of
primary
concern
to
the
drafters
of
the
statute.
they
were
considering
the
computation
of
net
income
and
so
expressed
the
definitions
both
of
gross
income
and
deductions.
i
passed
that
because
this
petitioner
is
entitled
to
the
deduction
because
it
is
the
same
taxpayer,
as
that
would
suffer
the
loss.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
that
is
the
question.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
it
may
be
--
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
no.
it
was
the
surviving
corporation
in
a
merger
of
the
17.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
the
statutes
of
missouri
and
illinois,
which
were
involved
in
this
case
and
which
are
set
out
in
the
briefs,
provide
that
any
two
or
more
corporations
may
merge
into
one
corporation
by
articles
of
merger
which
shall
designate
which
one
of
them
is
the
surviving
corporation
and
that
that
one
so
designated
shall
survive
with
all
the
rights,
powers,
duties,
liabilities
and
so
forth,
of
the
component
corporations
except
it's
limited
in
the
--
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
no,
there
was
not
a
new
corporation.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
that's
right.
a
merger
--
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
merger
is
the
technical
word
of
the
statute,
all
became
one.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
it
was
merger.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
looked
on
as
if
two
streams
has
flowed
together
forming
one
stream.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
the
following
stream
includes
all
the
pre-disaster
streams.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
the
management
corporation
was
selected
as
that
which
should
survive.
now,
the
consideration
of
the
question
whether
or
not
the
corporation
surviving
the
merger
may
have
the
benefit
of
net
operating
loss
carry-over,
may
be
approached
on
either
of
two
basis,
both
lead
to
the
same
conclusion.
first,
we
may
address
ourselves
to
the
exact
technical
language
and
requirements
of
the
statute
and
the
authorities
under
that
statute.
it
will
have
been
noted
that
--
from
the
quotation
of
the
statute
that
a
deduction
is
allowed
if
the
taxpayer
suffers
a
loss.
petitioner,
we
assert,
as
the
same
taxpayer
as
its
component
corporations.
it
owes
their
taxes.
the
pertinent
corporation
statutes
which
have
been
quoted
from
missouri
and
illinois
are
in
this
respect
identical
with
the
statutes
of
almost
every
other
state.
they
provide
for
this
continuity.
now
then,
three
taxpayers,
three
corporations,
three
accounting
units
suffer
losses
in
1948
and
1949.
the
statutes
says
that
--
that
these
losses
shall
be
carry-overs.
for
whom
shall
they
be
carry-overs?
the
answer,
for
petitioner,
because
there
is
no
other
person
that
can
be
suggested
who
succeeds
to
these
carry-overs
along
with
all
the
assets,
liabilities,
every
other
characteristic
of
its
component
corporation.
now,
that's
the
result
of
the
statutes
of
missouri,
illinois,
the
state
statutes.
an
inquiry
may
be
addressed
as
to
whether
or
not
the
state
statutes
are
controlling
in
this
matter.
the
answer
to
that
inquiry
is
that
they
are,
and
the
reason
that
the
internal
revenue
code
expressly
so
provides.
it
does
so
in
its
definition
of
corporation
that
a
corporation
shall
include
associations,
trusts
and
so
forth.
of
course,
we
all
know
that
the
word
corporation
includes
also
any
organization
to
which
a
charter
is
granted
under
state
law
that
the
word
corporation
is
not
limited
to
an
association,
trust
or
partnership.
that
one
individual
may
own
all
the
shares
of
--
of
a
corporation.
in
which
case,
there
would
be
no
association,
no
trust,
no
partnership.
nevertheless,
there
is
a
corporation.
so
that
by
definition,
the
internal
revenue
code
adopts
the
state
law
for
the
determination
of
the
existence
of
a
corporation.
having
adopted
that
state
law
for
the
determination
of
existence,
it's
a
logical
necessity
that
the
same
law
be
looked
to,
to
determine
continuity.
continuity,
existence,
corporate
entity,
corporate
identity
just
aren't
separable.
they
mean
the
same
thing.
then
further,
taking
this
particular
case
to
determine
the
application
of
state
law,
we
find
that
without
the
application
of
state
law,
there
is
no
basis
for
the
very
beginning
statement
in
this
case.
i
stated
that
prior
to
1949,
there
were
17
corporations.
the
only
reason
that
there
were
17
corporations
was
that
there
were
17
charters
issued
by
the
states
of
missouri
and
the
state
of
illinois.
if
we
attempt
to
disregard
the
laws
of
the
various
states
in
determining
corporate
existence,
corporate
separateness,
corporate
continuity,
corporate
entity,
we
must
find
in
this
case
that
prior
to
1949,
there
was
only
one
corporation,
that
there
was
no
merger.
17
corporations
existed
only
because
there
were
17
charters
and
the
state
law
recognized
17
separate
accounting
units,
entity
corporations.
now,
this
is
--
has
been
the
accepted
practice
of
treasury
department,
of
all
administrative
agencies
since
the
beginning
of
the
income
tax
law
that
any
entity
with
a
charter,
organization
chartered
by
the
state
as
a
corporation
,is
necessarily
a
corporation
regardless
of
whether
or
not
it's
in
association,
trust
or
partnership.
so,
we
have
the
state
law
to
--
to
look
to.
we
have
it
adopted
into
the
internal
revenue
code.
we
have
the
state
law
providing
the
kind
of
succession
which
here
occurred,
the
kind
of
continuity
of
existence
looking
to
the
state
law
for
the
determination
of
existence
and
entity.
we
must
also
look
there
for
the
determination
of
continuity
and
identity.
now,
we
may
look
for
a
moment
to
the
decisions
pertinent
to
this
question,
particularly,
the
case
of
helvering
versus
metropolitan
edison
company.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
the
surviving
corporation
was
a
missouri
corporation.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
no
question
has
ever
been
raised.
the
statutes
of
missouri
and
illinois
are
identical
in
their
provisions
for
merger,
both
being
copies
from
the
delaware
statute.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
that's
right.
and
the
missouri
corporation
was
authorized
to
do
business
in
illinois.
referring
first
to
helvering
versus
metropolitan
edison
company
case,
that
case
involved
a
corporation
which
they
issued
bonds
for
less
than
far,
amortize
the
discount.
before
the
bonds
matured,
it
was
merged
with
another
corporation,
questioned
whether
or
not
the
other
corporation,
by
virtue
of
the
statutory
merger,
could
continue
the
amortization
answered
in
the
affirmative.
the
other
case
in
this
court
which
touches
upon
the
question
is
possibly
new
colonial
ice
company,
a
case
of
a
reorganization
different
from
a
merger.
it
was
a
case
in
which
the
colonial
ice
company
incurred
liabilities,
found
difficulty
under
its
corporate
charter,
transferred
all
its
assets
to
a
new
corporation
in
consideration
of
which
the
stock
of
the
new
corporation
was
issued
to
shareholders,
creditors
and
others
of
old
corporation.
without
any
exact
or
detailed
study
of
whether
or
not
a
reorganization
had
occurred,
it
was
held
that
the
losses
of
the
old
corporation
could
not
be
carried
forward
to
the
new
corporation.
it
was
pointed
out
by
the
court
that
the
old
corporation
kept
its
charter,
continued
to
exist.
now
then,
if
both
new
colonial
ice
company
and
the
more
recent
metropolitan
edison
decision
are
to
be
accepted
as
correct
decisions,
the
problem
is
to
find
the
material
distinction
between
the
two
cases.
the
difference
repeatedly
pointed
out
both
in
the
lower
courts
and
the
treasury
department
rulings
and
the
administrative
interpretations,
is
that
one
case
involved
a
reorganization
which
was
not
a
merger,
the
new
colonial
ice
case.
the
other
case,
metropolitan
edison
involved
a
reorganization
which
was
a
merger.
that
distinction
may
be
accepted.
without
that
distinction,
the
cases
are
in
conflict.
the
distinction
has
been
accepted
by
congress.
the
quotations
from
congress
have
been
set
out
in
the
briefs.
the
distinction
has
now
been
abolished
by
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954.
it
was
described
as
an
over
technical
distinction.
the
distinction
is
made.
if
it's
accepted,
it
follows
that
in
this
case
since
a
merger
occurred,
the
loss
may
be
carried
--
carried
forward
under
the
doctrine
of
metropolitan
edison.
in
another
case,
if
it
was
a
reorganization
of
a
different
kind,
then
the
carry-forward
might
not
be
allowable.
but
to
approach
the
question
more
generally
in
terms
of
reorganization,
it
may
be
urged
that
there's
no
real
distinction
between
a
merger
and
another
reorganization.
in
many
cases,
the
same
--
the
--
a
different
technique
may
be
used
to
accomplish
the
same
end.
this
certainly
is
the
reasoning
which
appealed
to
congress
when
it
enacted
the
revenue
code
of
1954.
and
it
may
possibly
be
that
the
distinction
has
no
materiality
to
it.
if
that
be
so,
then
the
new
colonial
ice
company
case
was
possibly
wrongly
decided.
nevertheless,
it
would
appear
that
the
metropolitan
edison
case
expresses
the
preferable
doctrine
that
if
new
colonial
is
to
be
abandoned,
the
proper
rule
should
be
that
upon
succession
in
a
reorganization,
the
net
operating
loss
suffered
by
a
predecessor
corporation
opt
to
be
allowed
as
a
carry
over
to
its
successor
in
a
reorganization
whether
or
not
it's
a
component
corporation.
now,
i
may
assume
here
that
in
this
regard,
notwithstanding
the
authorities
are
all
to
the
contrary,
no
difference
exists
between
a
merger
in
any
other
kind
of
reorganization.
we
know
the
substantial
purposes
of
congress
in
the
allowance
of
these
carry-overs.
the
substantial
purpose
is
to
alleviate
the
hardships
of
water-tight
annual
accounting
periods.
these
annual
accounting
periods
have
as
their
only
justification,
the
administrative
expediency.
where
it
is
consistent
with
administrative
expediency
to
allow
the
carry
forward,
congress
has
intended
to
do
it.
congress
has
shown,
by
its
language,
that
its
concern
is
less
with
who
may
carry
over
the
loss,
who
may
take
the
loss,
and
with
the
substantial
proposition
that
the
loss
may
be
carried
forward,
it
so
expressed.
previous
statutes
have
reiterated
the
word
taxpayer.
words
have
been
changed
one
way
or
another
but
without
any
apparent
intention
to
make
a
substantial
change
in
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
the
fundamental
injunction
of
the
statute
is
the
net
loss
shall
be
a
carry-over.
now,
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
petitioner
is
poor
by
reason
of
the
losses
which
its
predecessor
suffered,
that
no
other
person
is,
no
independent
corporation
exist.
there
can
be
only
one
surviving
corporation
in
a
merger.
this
corporation
is
liable
for
the
debts
of
its
predecessor,
not
by
contract,
by
mere
operation
of
law,
by
succession,
by
continuity.
this
corporation
merely
continues
the
businesses,
the
operations,
the
assets,
all
the
elements
of
its
predecessors.
now,
to
be
sure
if
we
go
into
the
meaning
of
reorganization,
why
the
reorganization
sections
were
passed,
you
find
this
history
which
i
may
state
briefly
that
the
original
revenue
act
contained
no
provision
whatsoever
or
nonrecognition
of
gain
upon
exchanges.
the
courts
commenced
working
out
rules
to
govern
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
upon
a
particular
exchange,
there
was
a
disposition
of
an
asset
or
mere
continuity
of
ownership
in
a
different
form
contrasting
termination
continuity.
now,
that
was
a
very
difficult
question,
the
variety
of
transactions,
infinite.
before
very
long,
congress
came
to
the
aid
of
the
courts
and
enacted
definitions
of
the
kinds
of
exchanges
which
resulted
in
continuity
as
compared
to
the
kinds
of
exchanges
which
were
--
resulted
in
termination
of
an
interest.
now,
it
may
well
be
that
the
courts,
possibly
under
the
leadership
of
mr.
justice
mcreynolds,
were
over
anxious
to
help
as
to
accept
this
exact
statutory
help
which
congress
had
given
them
to
apply
the
words
of
the
reorganization
without
any
thought
as
to
the
reasoning
that
went
behind
and
if
a
transaction
fit
the
form
of
the
statute
to
declare
the
reorganization.
this
was
the
state
of
the
law
when
the
new
colonial
ice
company
case
was
decided.
there
was
no
consideration
given
to
the
reason
for
the
rules
on
reorganization,
rather,
if
the
form
of
an
exchange
fit
the
description
of
the
statute,
that
was
a
reorganization.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
it
continued
to
exist.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
as
a
shell
probably
and
conducted
no
business.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
it
was
not
dissolved.
the
court
adverts
to
that
fact.
now,
the
rule
that
in
order
for
reorganization
to
exist,
there
must
be
a
substantial
continuity.
it
was
read
into
the
statute
and
enunciated
clearly,
given
expression
for
the
first
time
in
gregory
versus
helvering,
decided
about
a
year
later
than
the
new
colonial
ice
decision.
the
metropolitan
edison
case
was
decided
on
the
heels
of
gregory
versus
helvering.
so
that
reading
the
decisions
and
the
purposes
of
the
statute
together,
what
we
find
is
that
after
the
decision
in
the
new
colonial
case,
this
court
came
to
a
realization
that
in
order
for
a
reorganization
to
occur,
there
must
be
continuity.
it's
so
held
in
the
metropolitan
edison
case,
after
the
decision
in
gregory
versus
helvering,
in
which
that
rule
had
first
gained
expression.
now
then,
if
continuity
exist,
identity
must
exist.
the
two
words
mean
the
same.
if
something
continuous,
it's
the
same
as
that
which
previously
existed
to
distinguish
between
continuity
and
continued
identity.
it
doesn't
appeal
to
the
mind.
now,
this
is
the
background
of
the
metropolitan
edison
case.
it
represents
the
current
trend
of
decision
with
reference
to
reorganization,
that
reorganization
that
presents
continuity,
continuity
represents
identity.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
yes.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
yes.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
if
they
had
had
income
in
succeeding
years,
of
course
they
could
have.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
there's
no
tax
benefits.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
at
the
time
of
the
merger,
it
could
not
be
known
whether
or
not
the
three
businesses,
three
locations
which
has
operated
at
loss
in
previous
years
would
operate
at
a
net
profit
in
the
succeeding
years.
certainly,
it
was
the
hope
of
any
businessman
that
those
locations
would
show
a
profit,
otherwise,
they
would
have
been
closed.
so
that
whether
or
not
that
net
operating
loss
would
have
done
any
good
would
depend
on
circumstances
which
could
not
possibly
be
known.
on
july
31,
1949,
when
the
merger
occurred.
it
was
the
succeeding
years
which
gave
rise
to
the
source
of
benefit,
facts
unknown
at
the
time
of
merger.
the
carry
forward
existed,
whether
or
not
it
would
do
any
benefit
--
accomplish
any
benefit,
must
depend
on
the
profit
picture
in
the
succeeding
years.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
the
fact
is
that
they
did
suffer
loss.
that
loss
may
result
from
some
extent
to
allocation
of
overhead,
similar
accounting
devices
which
are
of
questionable
reality.
the
business
as
a
whole,
all
the
retail
locations
together
operated
comfortably
after
the
merger.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
to
an
extent,
that
may
be
true.
the
profits
of
the
other
corporations
came
into
the
picture.
now
then,
if
we're
approaching
this
on
a
substantial
ground,
it
would
seem
improvident
to
reach
one
rule
if
the
loss
corporation
were
the
surviving
corporation.
and
another
rule,
if
a
different
component
corporation
were
the
surviving
corporation.
the
implication
of
the
statutes
of
both
missouri
and
illinois
is
that
the
corporate
existence
of
all
corporations
continues
in
the
merged
corporation.
so
that
approaching
the
question
substantially,
what
ought
to
be
done
as
a
matter
of
economic
substance,
no
distinction
ought
to
be
made
based
on
which
of
the
corporations
is
named
as
the
surviving
corporation.
that
is
only
a
question
of
draftsmanship.
it
makes
no
difference
other
than
what
words
you
write
in
the
paper
you
file
with
the
secretary
of
state.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
all
of
the
corporations
had
a
fiscal
year
ending,
july
31st.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
the
merger
occurred
as
of
july
31st,
1949.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
yes.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
it
would
depend
on
subsequent
events
if
those
--
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
no,
the
merger
must
--
shorter
filing
consolidated
returns.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
now,
in
any
particular
situation
--
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
yes.
in
the
particular
situation,
the
tax
disadvantage
would
far
outweigh
any
tax
advantage
gained
in
this
situation.
in
as
much
as
with
17
separate
corporations,
there
were
17
exemptions
from
surtax
of
$25,000
each.
by
virtue
of
the
merger,
there
was
only
one.
now,
that
comes
to
some
$400,000
exempt
from
surtax
prior
to
the
merger
with
$25,000
exempt
from
surtax
subsequent
to
the
merger.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
yes.
mr.
henry
c.
lowenhaupt
that's
right.
now
then,
it's
unnecessary
in
this
case
to
decide
that
the
new
colonial
decision
is
wrong,
but
this
case
follows
the
metropolitan
decision.
nevertheless,
the
new
colonial
case,
as
congress
has
stated,
should
at
least
be
confined
to
its
own
facts.
let
me
read
the
statement
from
the
congressional
committee
reports.
"your
committee
agrees
that
whether
or
not
the
items
carry-over
should
be
based
upon
economic
realities
rather
than
upon
such
artificialities
as
the
legal
form
of
the
reorganization.
the
new
rules,
speaking
of
the
rules
of
the
1954
code,
enable
the
successor
corporation
to
step
into
the
tax
dues
of
its
predecessor
corporation
without
necessarily
conforming
to
artificial
legal
requirements
which
now
exist
under
court-made
law,"
speaking
of
the
distinction
made
between
metropolitan
edison
and
new
colonial
ice.
congressional
reports
have
used
the
same
reference
to
pension
trust
deductions
and
numerous
other
kinds
of
deductions
which
may
be
carried
forward.
they
indicate
that
all
these
tax
credits
are
to
be
considered
in
the
same
light.
in
1954,
they
rejected
the
distinction
which
has
been
made
between
new
colonial
and
metropolitan
edison,
recognized
as
its
--
this
distinction
as
existing
prior
to
1954.
whether
or
not
this
distinction
can
coexist
with
the
doctrine
of
gregory
versus
helvering,
that
reorganization
is
a
substantial
thing
involving
continuity
of
the
business,
need
not
be
decided
here.
the
reason
is
that
this
case
involves
a
statutory
merger.
petitioner
is
entitled
to
the
credit
claim
under
the
doctrine
of
the
metropolitan
case,
whether
or
not
the
doctrine
of
new
colonial
stands.
but
at
this
point,
to
extend
the
doctrine
of
new
colonial,
contrary
to
the
--
to
the
settled
understanding
of
congress,
to
the
expressions
of
the
courts,
the
treasury
department,
the
understanding
of
the
bar
would
be
a
rather
pitiful
effort
against
a
rather
broad
current
of
judicial
decision,
judicial
interpretation
on
the
nature
of
a
merger
and
what
a
merger
is.
for
these
reasons,
it's
submitted
that
the
carry-forward
should
be
allowed.
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
the
time
for
(inaudible)
to
answer.
