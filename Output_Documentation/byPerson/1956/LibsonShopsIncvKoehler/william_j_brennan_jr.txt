they

centralized
buying?

did
the
buying?
justice
william
j.

and
none
of
the
corporations
was
a
manufacturer?
justice

which
was
the

corporation?

justice
william
j.
brennan,

over
what
years
were
these
companies
organized?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
your
statement
applicable
to
both
of
the
years?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
they
didn't
--
they
didn't
continue
the
business
so
as
to
get
tax
deduction,
i
take
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
it
make
any
difference
that
all
of
the
--
all
of
the
corporations
sold
the
same
product?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
your
--
would
yours
be
a
stronger
case
do
you
think
if
each
of
these
16
constituent
companies
had
been
in
a
different
business?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that's
not
suggested
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
say
that
except
for
charter
amendments,
the
surviving
corporation
could
not
have
been
an
operating
company?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
mean
that
if
it
could
have
operated
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
did.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
tell
me.
i
--
i
had
the
impression
as
to
where
there
were
statutory
mergers.
i'm
speaking
now
--
but
we
understand
generally
as
merger
is
distinguished
to
other
forms,
consolidation
and
the
like,
and
the
big
fish
swallows
the
small
one.
after
that,
you
have
to
look
to
the
big
fish
to
collect
anything.
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
small
ones
disappeared.
well,
why
shouldn't
that
carry
with
it
the
right
of
the
big
fish
to
take
on
whatever
the
small
one
was
allowed
to
have
in
way
of
the
taxes?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
kind
of
expense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
if
the
taxpayer
prevails,
do
you
see
any
particular
loophole,
would
have
assessed
as
tax
consequence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
gather
it
never
actually
operated
the
retail
outlet
until
after
the
mergers,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
it
--
is
it
--
the
statutory
merger
as
to
the
constituent
corporations
that
are
swallowed
up
by
the
survivor
continue
in
any
sense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then,
you
can't
sue
them
anymore,
can
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
under
the
laws
of
missouri
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
you
telling
us
that
despite
this
merger
then
that
these
three
corporations
would
suffer
the
losses
may
still
be
sued
and
be
sued
--
pursued
and
be
sued
where
they
were
organized
for
instance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
--
yes,
but
whom
do
you
sue,
the
surviving
corporation
or
the
original
corporation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
you
sue
the
constituent
corporations?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
