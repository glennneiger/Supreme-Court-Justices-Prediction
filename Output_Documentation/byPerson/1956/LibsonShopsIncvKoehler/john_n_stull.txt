mr.
john
n.
stull
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
harlan
and
mr.
justice
black
have
succinctly
stated
the
government's
difficulty
with
this
case.
that
is
that
in
our
view,
the
taxpayer's
position
boils
down
to
a
contention
that
losses
realized
by
three
separate
businesses
that
never
could,
up
to
and
including
the
year
of
the
merger
here
under
consideration,
all
set
the
income
or
reduce
the
taxes
of
those
businesses,
can
as
a
result
of
the
--
this
merger
suddenly
all
set
to
fit
the
income
and
reduce
the
taxes
of
14
other
businesses.
our
position
is
that
if
this
is
a
correct
result,
it's
certainly
one
that
should
be
set
forth
in
the
statute.
we
don't
think
it
is.
now,
i'd
like
to
go
back
for
just
a
second
over
the
facts
of
this
case
since
they
were
very
briefly
stated.
the
owners
of
these
16
retail
stores
and
the
one
store
supplying
management
to
it
chose
to
operate
in
the
corporate
form.
they
could
have
chosen
to
do
it
through
the
medium
of
one
corporation
with
17
separate
divisions.
they
did
not
do
this.
and
if
they
had
done
it,
they
--
they
would
have
been
able
to
offset
the
losses
of
these
ailing
corporations
against
the
profits
of
the
good
corporations
and
this
case
never
would
have
arisen.
but
they
chose
to
operate
this
business
through
the
medium
of
13
missouri
corporations
and
four
illinois
corporations.
our
counsel
has
stated
that
there
would
be
some
advantages
to
doing
this.
they
certainly
wouldn't
have
done
it
if
there
hadn't
been
advantages
such
as
limiting
liability,
possibly
reducing
state
franchise
taxes.
and
certainly,
at
the
inception
of
businesses,
it's
well
if
it's
possible
to
be
able
to
chop
them
up
into
as
many
segments
as
possible
for
federal
income
tax
purposes.
in
the
years
here
in
consideration,
the
lowest
corporate
rates
were
imposed
upon
net
incomes
below
$25,000.
somewhat
higher
rates
were
imposed
on
incomes
from
$25,000
to
$50,000
and
the
highest
rates
were
reserved
for
incomes
in
excess
of
$50,000.
mr.
john
n.
stull
those
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
pardon
me
sir?
mr.
john
n.
stull
they
started
in
1946
and
i
believe
the
last
one
was
1948,
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes,
sir.
later
on,
there
was
a
change
in
that,
but
this
--
it
still
is
in
effect
that
corporations
within
counts
below
$25,000
pay
less
tax.
so,
it
still
is
advantageous
to
chop
up
your
businesses
into
small
segments.
now,
even
though
they
chose
this
form
for
whatever
advantages
they
realized
or
hoped
to
realize,
they
still
could
have
avoided
this
situation
by
filing
a
consolidated
federal
income
tax
return
which
would
have
in
effect
ignored
the
separate
corporate
entities.
but
of
course,
that
has
a
disadvantage
of
a
2%
additional
surtax,
and
also,
it
has
the
disadvantage
of
giving
you
only
one
net
income
and
loses
the
advantage
of
splitting
up
those
incomes
for
the
lower
tax
rates.
now,
three
of
these
corporations,
separate
losses,
two
were
illinois
corporations
and
one
was
a
missouri
corporation.
these
losses
qualified
under
the
statute
as
net
operating
losses
which
could
be
carried
forward
to
offset
the
income
of
the
corporations
for
the
next
three
years.
i
don't
believe
that
counsel
meant
to
make
any
contention
that
these
corporations
should
be
ignored
for
federal
income
tax
purposes
so
that
the
losses
of
the
three
ailing
businesses
prior
to
the
merger
could
have
offset
the
income
from
the
other
businesses
prior
to
the
merger.
on
august
1,
1949,
these
corporations
went
through
a
merger
under
the
state
laws
of
missouri
and
illinois.
as
a
result
of
that
merger,
the
resulting
corporation
was
a
missouri
corporation.
it
had
its
name
changed.
it
changed
and
increased
its
authorized
shares
and
it
extended
its
business
purposes.
and
the
taxpayer
now
says,
that
as
a
result
of
complying
with
these
state
laws,
the
pre-merger
losses
two
separate
illinois
corporations
and
one
separate
missouri
corporation,
can
now
offset
the
post-merger
profits
of
a
resulting
missouri
corporation.
mr.
john
n.
stull
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
on
that,
sir.
the
only
thing
that's
in
the
record
is
that
they
were
extended.
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
particularly
important
to
the
government's
position
in
this
case.
mr.
john
n.
stull
well,
it's
just
--
i
have
mentioned
it
to
show
that
it
wasn't
exactly
the
same
thing
that
they
started
off
with
before
from
the
corporate
entity
view.
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes,
sir,
except
that
it
is
stipulated
that
there
were
certain
changes.
how
extensive
they
were,
we
have
no
way
of
knowing.
now,
these
--
the
taxpayer's
position
in
this
case
is
that
the
resulting
missouri
corporation
now
can
deduct
from
the
profits
of
these
14
other
businesses,
the
losses
of
the
three
ailing
businesses
which
would
suffer
prior
to
the
merger,
which
certainly
couldn't
have
been
deducted
from
them
before.
now,
while
counsel
below,
somewhat,
the
separate
accounting
theory
after
the
merger,
it
is
stipulated
that
separate
accounting
showed
that
those
three
locations
as
he
calls
them
businesses,
i
think
they
were,
still
suffered
losses
after
the
merger.
so
that
this
post
--
these
pre-merger
losses
never
could,
up
to
and
including
this
year,
have
all
set
any
income
or
reduced
any
tax
but
for
this
merger.
now,
the
basis
of
taxpayer's
position
here
seems
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
i
certainly
do,
sir,
because
we
have
losses
that
never
could
have
been
used
if
these
corporations
had
continued
the
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
--
way
they
were
before.
mr.
john
n.
stull
well,
they
certainly
didn't
drop
them,
sir,
even
though
they
did
realize
losses.
mr.
john
n.
stull
and
it
maybe
that
they
--
it
maybe
in
the
next
20
years
they
might
have
made
a
profit
that
could
carry
forward
to
going
through.
mr.
john
n.
stull
well,
it's
perfectly
possible
that
they
did,
sir.
this
--
this
whole
thing
opens
up
a
--
failed
a
tax
avoidance
in
our
view.
that
is
that
you
can
get
two
shots
of
the
apple
here
by
using
--
if
this
result
is
a
correct
one.
somebody
starts
up
a
new
business.
let's
take
the
operating
loss
carry-over
provisions
of
--
few
years
later
to
accentuate
it.
those
loss
provisions
gave
you
five
years
forward
and
one
year
back
for
seven
years'
pay.
you
can
start
up
your
business
when
you
expect
that
some
of
the
end
segments
of
this
business
may
realize
losses.
in
any
event,
you're
going
to
keep
them
small
so
that
you
can
get
the
event
of
the
lower
surtax.
but
you
know
that
if
at
the
end
of
five
years
or
just
before
the
end
of
five
years,
any
of
these
other
businesses
have
made
such
losses
that
it's
advantageous
to
put
together,
you
have
nothing
to
lose,
you
could
just
put
them
together.
and
these
losses
will
offset
the
income
just
as
they
would
have
if
you
had
operated
under
the
--
under
one
single
corporation
from
the
very
beginning.
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes,
sir,
we
do.
we
think
that,
that
should
only
be
allowed
if
it's
clearly
allowed
by
the
federal
tax
statute.
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes,
sir.
these
are
separate
corporate
entities.
we
cannot
look
through
them
to
the
people
back
at
it.
they
pay
their
own
taxes.
they
are
able
to
store
up
income
in
them.
if
they
had
wanted
to
worry
about
the
people
behind
it,
they
could
have
operated
in
partnership
form,
for
example.
then,
this
case
never
would
have
arisen
because
there
would
have
only
been
one
income
for
this
--
this
partnership.
mr.
john
n.
stull
i
think
that
that
has
some
relevancy
in
this
case,
but
i
can't
see
that
the
business
of
a
missouri
corporation
which
is
now
operating
16
different
retail
outlets
spread
throughout
illinois
and
missouri,
and
also,
furnishing
management
to
them
is
the
same
business
as
a
former
missouri
corporation
or
as
the
old
missouri
corporation
which
was
only
in
missouri
and
was
only
furnishing
management
services
to
the
other
corporations.
i
think
there's
been
a
complete
change
in
business
by
that
corporation
even
though
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
that's
--
that's
really
difficult
to
say.
i
think
that
what
the
businesses
are
doesn't
make
any
difference.
in
this
particular
case,
i
think
that
the
fact
that
they
were
similar
is
not
material
here.
i
don't
think
we
would
have
much
of
a
stronger
case
except
as
it
might
show
tax
avoidance
if
they
were
--
even
further
if
they
were
trying
to
put
two
things
--
things
together.
mr.
john
n.
stull
i
think
that
these
results
in
a
tax
avoidance
scheme,
your
honor,
as
i've
said
before
about
giving
the
taxpayer
two
shots
at
this
thing.
mr.
john
n.
stull
only
if
the
statute
--
the
federal
income
tax
law
sold
out,
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
there's
no
question
of
relation
here.
mr.
john
n.
stull
no
question
about
that,
sir.
there
would
have
been
no
carry-over.
mr.
john
n.
stull
because
there
is
an
entirely
different
taxable
entity.
there
is
now
instead
of
17
individuals
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
pardon
me
sir?
mr.
john
n.
stull
that's
what
we
say.
mr.
john
n.
stull
that's
our
position.
mr.
john
n.
stull
now,
they
--
they
have
to
take
the
disabilities
to
go
along
with
it.
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes,
sir.
i
think
that's
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
john
n.
stull
it's
perfectly
all
right,
sir,
for
them
to
do
business
in
17
corporations.
mr.
john
n.
stull
that's
right.
exactly,
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
no,
sir.
you
can't
even
--
even
if
you
and
i
should
go
into
a
partnership,
our
three
partnership
losses
wouldn't
be
carried
over
to
partnerships,
so
far
as
i
know.
that,
it
would
--
it
would
have
that
effect.
i
take
that
back,
sir.
it
would
have
that
effect,
because
the
individual
has
his
own
losses
which
should
be
offset
against
his
other
business
income
in
the
future
year.
but
when
you
interject
the
corporate
entity,
then
--
then
you
can't
go
across
the
corporate
line
with
net
operating
losses.
i
don't
think
you
could
say
that
it
was
the
same
taxpayer,
you
cannot
look
through
that
entity.
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes,
sir,
because
the
federal
income
tax
laws
look
through
a
partnership
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes,
sir.
it's
not
a
taxable
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
well,
it's
a
tax-computing
entity
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
--
but
it
is
not
a
taxable
entity,
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
no,
sir.
i
don't
know
that.
i
don't
believe
that's
so.
mr.
john
n.
stull
i
think
that
it
did
have
the
power
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
--
to
do
this
prior
to
the
merger.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
no,
the
management
company,
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
well,
it
was
the
resulting
corporation
from
this
merger.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
and
had
been
in
existence
before
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
--
with
--
with
some
minor
changes.
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes,
sir.
the
tax
law
recognizes
that
you
can
put
together
two
corporations
by
statutory
merger
where
that's
allowed
of
course
by
the
states
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
--
without
imposing
income
tax
liability
on
either
the
corporations
or
on
the
shareholders
who
make
exchanges.
but
there
is
no
provision
saying
that
you
can
carry
over
net
operating
loss
after
a
merger.
mr.
john
n.
stull
then
they
could
have
carried
forward
the
losses
to
offset
against
their
own
income.
mr.
john
n.
stull
they're
trying
to
offset
the
losses
of
these
--
these
pre-merger
losses
against
in
effect
income
realized
after
the
merger
by
what
we
still
--
what
we
say
is
an
entirely
different
corporation.
this
resulting
corporation
derived
from,
the
businesses
is
carried
on
by
the
14
other
corporations.
they
were
profitable
both
before
and
after
the
merger.
mr.
john
n.
stull
well,
perhaps
under
the
state
law,
they
do,
sir.
but
i
don't
think
that
that
has
anything
to
do
with
the
federal
income
tax
consequences
of
the
merger.
mr.
john
n.
stull
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
it
--
well,
it
carries
on
the
businesses
formerly
carried
on
by
the
others.
mr.
john
n.
stull
i
suppose
there
is
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
because
one
continue,
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
under
state
law,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes,
sir,
under
state
law.
mr.
john
n.
stull
well,
because
they've
--
supposedly
under
the
state
law,
they
are
now
identified
with
one
resulting
corporation
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
--
that
they
do
not
survive
as
particular
state
entities.
mr.
john
n.
stull
that's
what
the
state
law
says.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
well,
we
say
that
the
same
--
the
way
they
continue
as
the
same
corporation
under
the
state
law,
but
they
don't
continue
as
the
same
corporation
or
as
the
same
taxpayer
under
section
122
under
the
federal
income
tax
laws.
mr.
john
n.
stull
well,
i
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
no,
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
well,
the
taxpayer
says
that
we
won't
and
we
say
that
we
will
get
--
that
we
should
get
the
full
tax.
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
we're
--
we're
destroying
there
--
we
say
that
the
authority
can
carry
forward
that
merger
that
those
were
pre-merger
losses
is
destroyed
by
the
merger.
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes,
sir,
exactly.
mr.
john
n.
stull
that
--
that
is
correct
because
it's
their
liability.
i
think
that
state
law
would
say
that
it's
a
liability
like
any
other
debt,
and
i
think
that
we
could
collect
from
them.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
well,
because
in
the
--
in
the
case
of
the
tax
liability,
it's
a
question
there
of
a
debt
that
is
owed
by
the
resulting
corporation
because
the
losses
that
said,
they
have
to
take
over
all
the
assets
and
they
have
to
assume
all
the
liabilities.
so,
it's
their
debt
that
they
are
paying.
and
it's
they
--
they
that
we
can
go
after
in
that
particular
case.
but
that
doesn't
say
that
a
pre-merger
loss
carries
over
because
that
is
a
loss
of
a
corporation
which
no
longer
exists
as
a
corporation.
it
only
exists
under
the
state
law
as
a
part
of
the
resulting
corporation.
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
sir,
i've
come
to
a
legislative
history
of
this
--
of
the
net
operating
loss,
carry-forward
and
carry-back
provisions
but
i
haven't
found
anything
that's
particularly
helpful.
i
haven't
been
able
to
find
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
indicates
that
they
ever
wanted
to
allow
this
situation.
and
certainly,
nothing
that
indicates
that
they
wanted
to
allow
in
the
effect
pulling
losses
the
way
it's
happening
here,
pulling
the
losses
and
the
gains
of
corporations
as
a
result
of
the
carry-overs.
that
was
never
meant.
mr.
john
n.
stull
the
merger
provisions
have
been
in
the
tax
laws
for
a
long
time.
i
know
as
long
--
goes
from
1921,
sir.
and
the
--
the
only
two
cases
on
it
that
i
know
decided
by
this
court
are
the
new
colonial
ice
company
case
and
the
metropolitan
edison
company
case
which
we
feel
are
entirely
distinguishable.
we
think
the
metropolitan
edison
company
case
is
distinguishable
and
it
just
never
decided
this
question.
because
in
that
case,
that
had
to
do
with
discount
on
bonds
issued
by
the
corporation
which
is
in
effect
an
interest
expense
because
the
corporation
of
course
has
to
eventually
redeem
to
that
power.
so,
they
allow
an
amortization
derivable
deduction.
after
the
merger,
the
corporation
resulting
from
that
merger
has
the
liability
to
repay
those
bonds,
and
it's
going
to
--
to
suffer
this
loss.
so,
we
say
that
under
the
metropolitan
edison
company
case
that
if
a
corporation
has
a
post-merger
expense
even
though
it
may
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
a
post-merger
expense,
even
though
it
may
have
originated
with
some
transaction
that
took
place
pre-merger
that
is
perfectly
all
right
for
it
to
take
a
deduction
and
because
it
its
liability
and
its
expense
that's
being
paid.
now,
the
metropolitan
edison
company
case
and
distinguished
--
being
distinguished
on
that
ground
from
the
new
colonial
ice
company
case,
i
must
admit
that
we're
not
completely
happy
with
the
metropolitan
edison
case
or
rather
than
the
government's
conduct
in
it
because
in
that
case,
it
was
conceded
that
if
a
statutory
merger
took
place
that
the
deduction
would
have
been
allowed.
we
don't
know
quite
why
that
was
done
on
brief
and
unfortunately,
everybody
connected
without
debts
and
we
can't
find
out.
but
we
do
think
that
probably,
it
was
to
win
that
case
if
they
thought
that
there
was
not
a
statutory
merger
in
the
case
and
since
some
of
the
lower
courts
had
gone
off
on
the
distinction
between
statutory
mergers
and
other
mergers,
they
decided
to
follow
that
and
win
that
particular
case.
now,
the
result
contended
for
by
taxpayer
here
would,
although
it
seems
to
be
going
further
than
any
of
the
lower
courts
had
gone
in
oral
argument
here,
would
result
in
these
losses
being
allowable
after
a
statutory
merger
but
not
after
other
mergers
which
are
tax-free
under
the
federal
income
tax
laws.
a
few
years
ago
of
course,
a
lot
of
states
didn't
allow
the
mergers
or
perhaps
they
didn't
allow
a
merger
with
a
foreign
corporation.
so,
the
federal
income
tax
law
has
a
practical
merger
which
is
the
same
effect,
it's
a
--
an
exchange
of
stock
for
assets.
and
as
i
understand
these
lower
court
opinions
in
this
--
on
this
ground,
they
wouldn't
allow
in
that
situation
the
carry-overs
to
go
forward.
they
look
at
state
law,
and
they'd
say
that
if
it's
a
statutory
merger
under
the
state
law,
it
will
allow
to
carry-forwards,
but
if
it's
a
practical
merger
or
the
tax
pre-liquidation
of
the
subsidiary,
we
won't
allow
it.
now,
that
--
that
seems
to
me
that
congress
usually
tries
to
legislate
uniformly
throughout
the
states.
and
if
the
carry
forward
of
a
net
operating
loss
is
going
to
depend
upon
the
particular
state
law,
we
think
that
it
certainly
should
be
clearly
set
forth
in
the
statute
and
we
will
see
if
it
is.
mr.
john
n.
stull
they
could
have
incited
to
that,
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
they
did
not.
mr.
john
n.
stull
they
wanted
to
take
the
advantages
of
separate
returns
and
separate
corporations.
mr.
john
n.
stull
incitement.
mr.
john
n.
stull
well,
i
do
think
that
it's
going
to
--
it
may
open
up
areas,
other
areas,
your
honor.
and
that
if
state
law
is
to
control
in
this
situation.
it
seems
to
me
that
a
lot
of
decisions
of
this
court
have
to
be
distinguished
in
a
way
i
certainly
can't
do
it
and
possibly
overturn.
it
also
seems
to
me
--
well,
to
answer
your
question
specifically,
this
--
this
particular
situation
has
been
taken
care
of
by
congress
in
the
1954
code.
now,
we
know
that
there'll
be
problems
that
will
arise
in
applying
those
provisions
but
this
particular
case
here
probably
would
not
arise
under
the
1954
code.
so,
the
area
of
tax
avoidance
may
be
a
limited
one.
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
and
they
--
we
have
a
--
there
is
a
possible
distinction
between
this
case
and
the
newmarket
case.
in
that
--
you
see,
our
basic
argument
here
is
that
these
losses
can
be
used
only
by
the
taxpayer
who
suffered
them.
that
has
got
to
be
the
same
taxpayer.
now,
we
say
there
are
two
facets
in
determining
whether
you
have
the
same
taxpayer.
one
is
the
entity,
is
it
the
same
entity?
well,
we
say
in
this
case
that
a
surviving
missouri
corporation
isn't
the
same
thing
as
all
the
rest
of
these
illinois
and
missouri
corporations.
we
also
say
in
newmarket
that
there,
a
massachusetts
corporation
which
was
the
old
corporation
is
not
the
same
taxable
entity
as
a
new
delaware
corporation.
now,
if
it
were
the
same
entity,
it
seems
to
us
that
they've
gone
through
an
out
of
gesture
and
an
expensive
one
in
moving
to
delaware
because
they
said
that
the
reason
they
moved
was
to
prevent
franchise,
massachusetts
franchise
tax
on
new
york
sales.
well,
if
they
hadn't
done
anything,
if
they
hadn't
had
any
advantages
from
moving
to
delaware,
if
they
had
the
same
corporation
that
they
had
before,
it
seems
to
me
that
they
wouldn't
have
gotten
out
of
franchise.
mr.
john
n.
stull
well,
sir
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
that
it
is
correct,
sir,
because
we
can't
argue
with
second
problem.
mr.
john
n.
stull
the
second
problem
to
our
argument
is
that
it
has
carry
on
the
same
business.
and
we
admit
that
in
newmarket,
it
is
carrying
on
the
same
business.
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
may
i
point
out
that
in
newmarket,
there
was
a
carry-back
rather
than
a
carry-forward.
mr.
john
n.
stull
--
and
it's
a
little
bit
even
more
difficult
for
me
to
see
how
a
loss
of
one
corporation,
the
delaware
corporation,
can
be
carried
back
and
used
to
offset
income
in
a
year
before
that
delaware
corporation
was
even
in
existence.
i
think
i
have
only
a
few
more
points
to
make.
i
want
to
say
that
the
legislative
history,
we
think,
whatever
there
is
in
it,
is
slightly
helpful
because
there's
no
indication
that
in
this
situation
would
ever
be
--
a
loss
would
be
allowed
to
be
carried
over.
we
don't
think
that
it
ever
was
indicated
that
approving
of
losses
would
be
allowed
such
as
resulted
here.
now,
there
has
been
mention
made
in
the
taxpayer's
brief
as
to
the
administrative
practice
or
the
administrative
practice
admittedly
has
not
been
quite
as
clear
as
it
might
have
been.
however,
there
has
never
been
any
regulation
or
any
ruling
with
the
dignity
of
the
treasury
decision
that
was
issued
covering
this
situation.
there
is
one
pension
trust
ruling
which
deals
with
the
carry
over
of
past
service
credits
which
are
funded
and
therefore
deducted
ratably
over
a
period
just
like
an
amortized
bond
discount.
we
think
that
the
rule
there
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
metropolitan
edison
company
case,
that
it
is
the
liability
of
the
resulting
corporation
and
therefore,
the
deduction
should
be
allowed.
we
haven't
been
treated
too
well
by
the
lower
courts
in
this
situation.
we
lost
in
the
second
circuit
with
judge
learned
hand
dissenting
in
1949
and
no
indication
ever
came
out
from
the
treasury
department
that
they
were
going
to
follow
that
case
and
in
fact,
they
kept
on
litigating
it
in
the
tax
court
and
in
these
cases
here.
i
think
that
probably,
although
i
might
say
that
we're
not
completely
"fundless"
before
this
court,
we
do
have
the
district
court
and
the
eighth
circuit
of
course,
we
have
judge
wyzanksi
who
was
overruled
by
the
first
circuit
and
we
have
the
tax
court
on
our
side,
and
we
have
judge
learned
hand
dissenting
in
the
stanton
brewery
company
case.
i
think
that
probably
the
distinction
made
by
the
courts
and
the
point
at
which
there
is
a
departure
between
newmarket,
gallo
and
this
case
and
others
is
the
emphasis
put
on
state
law
by
those
courts.
it's
also
probably
an
approach
to
the
net
operating
loss
carry-over
provision.
now,
we
say
that
it
is
a
deduction,
that
it
is
a
short
departure
from
the
annual
accounting
periods,
and
that
therefore,
it
should
be
construed
now.
some
of
the
lower
courts
seemed
to
feel
that
it
is
a
relief
provision
and
should
be
construed
rather
broadly.
i
think
that
is
possibly
that
all
i
can
get
from
the
interpretation
of
the
lower
court,
plus
the
fact
that
they
think
that
the
new
colonial
case
was
--
might
have
been
overruled
or
certainly
is
inapplicable
after
the
metropolitan
edison
company
case
which
we
don't
think
so
at
all.
i
can
do
now
in
part
or
in
closing
in
reading
part
of
the
dissent
from
judge
learned
hand's
opinion
which
i
think
pretty
well
sums
up
our
position
here.
he's
talking
about
an
excess
profits
tax
credit
carry-forward
which
in
principle
is
the
same
as
the
net
operating
loss
credit
carry-forward
here.
and
he
says,
“a
statute
so
intricate
and
detailed
such
as
this
means
little
latitude
for
interpretation.
moreover,
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
more
consistent
with
any
declared
purpose
that
i
can
find
to
extend
the
privilege
to
a
--
of
a
carry-over
to
the
taxpayer
far.
indeed,
as
a
decision
cited
in
my
brother's
opinion
show,
privilege
is
closely
akin
on
purpose
to
this
are
ordinary
laws
by
transfers
from
one
corporation
to
another.
and
the
full
of
the
transfer
cannot
be
imported.
we
have
no
warrant
for
supposing
that
congress
in
general
regard
such
credits
as
parts
of
a
universitas
juris
passing
with
the
chattels,
choses
an
action
and
the
rest
by
a
goodwill
or
trademarks.
mr.
john
n.
stull
that
is
a
question
of
form
and
i
would
have
to
answer
that
in
the
affirmative,
except
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
--
for
--
for
instance,
if
united
states
steel
merges
into
some
small
corporation
with
a
couple
of
million
dollars
of
losses
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
we
would
say
in
that
--
in
that
case
that
the
form
would
control
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
no,
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
i
don't
think
so,
sir.
i
think
that
there
has
been
a
change
of
taxpayer
in
that
case.
mr.
john
n.
stull
because
the
assets
that
produced
those
losses
or
the
--
the
losses
are
now
coming
over
into
another
corporation
to
offset
the
income
that
is
being
realized
from
assets
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
realizing
those
losses.
mr.
john
n.
stull
well,
unfortunately,
sometimes
those
things
happen
in
federal
tax
laws
that
you
get
stuck
with
these
particular
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
well,
i
think
that
the
continuity
test
of
the
surviving
--
of
their
incorporation
resulting
from
the
merger
in
your
first
instance
is
met.
mr.
john
n.
stull
the
--
unless
you
have
a
--
an
outstanding
example
like
the
one
i
gave.
