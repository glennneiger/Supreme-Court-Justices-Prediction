mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
mr.
chief
justice
and
justices.
i
might,
at
the
outset,
review
some
of
the
questions
that
occurred
as
to
the
facts
so
as
to
clarify
the
matters.
first,
the
question
of
when
the
corporations
were
organized
in
the
first
instance,
appears
at
the
record
at
page
14
and
it
appears
that
all
of
the
17,
except
one
were
organized
on
the
same
date,
on
january
2nd,
1946.
and
the
17th,
one
of
the
16
operating
corporations
came
in
later
about
two
years
later.
i
think
that
may
have
affected
the
picture
of
the
--
of
the
organization
of
the
enterprise.
second
question
that
was
raised
on
the
facts
is
the
question
of
the
change
in
the
purposes
of
the
corporation.
i
think
it
was
indicated
by
counsel
for
the
government
that
he
was
aware
of
no
material
change
in
the
charter
and
it
is
clear
from
the
record
at
page
15
that
the
management
corporation,
the
petitioner,
which
is
the
surviving
corporation,
was
authorized
to
engage
in
the
business
of
selling
of
the
commodity
in
question
prior
to
the
--
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
that
is
--
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
prior
to
that
time,
it
simply
acted
as
a
supervisory
corporation.
now,
the
question
of
the
--
the
basic
problem
here
as
--
as
indicated
maybe
discussed
in
terms
of
the
two
facets
to
the
government's
objection
to
the
allowance
of
the
carry-over
in
this
case.
the
one
facet
has
to
do
with
the
concept
of
the
same
taxpayer.
the
statute
of
course
uses
the
expression
"taxpayer"
and
the
government
contends
that
petitioner
is
not
the
taxpayer
who
suffered
any
of
the
losses
in
question.
now,
we
take
the
position
of
that
argument,
falls
as
soon
as
we
bring
into
the
--
into
the
discussion
the
concept
of
statutory
merger.
we
rely
upon
that
as
in
itself
answering
the
government's
objection
that
we
do
not
have
the
same
taxpayer
here.
because
once
we
bring
into
the
discussion
the
concept
of
statutory
merger,
we
bring
in
all
that
goes
with
it
including
the
notion
that
in
a
merger,
the
corporate
existence
with
each
of
the
components
continues
in
the
survivor.
so
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
as
a
result
of
the
merger,
in
contemplation
of
law
of
the
corporation
which
suffered
the
loss.
in
this
case
the
taxable
office
--
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
they
do
continue
without
substantive
facts
according
to
the
usual
exposition
of
the
doctrine.
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
no,
but
all
their
corporate
--
yes,
we
can
sue
them.
the
--
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
under
the
laws
of
missouri
and
illinois.
the
doctrine
is
such
that
--
the
only
thing
that
doesn't
continue
as
a
matter
of
fact
is
the
nominal
existence.
they
thought
the
component
corporations
don't
continue
in
the
--
in
the
form
of
a
--
of
a
separate
corporation.
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
the
statute
provides
that
the
--
that
any
--
any
obligations
of
the
component
corporations
after
the
merger
may
be
sued
upon
by
any
person
who
has
a
right
to
sue
them.
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
you
may
name
--
you
may
name
the
surviving
corporation.
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
as
such?
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
you
can
sue
them
as
such,
your
honor.
but
the
--
the
concept
of
mergers
that
all
the
rights
and
all
the
--
all
the
obligations
carry
over
and
that
that
being
the
--
that
--
that
is
incidentally
is
the
--
the
basis
of
the
theory
of
the
decision
of
this
court
in
metropolitan
edison
company
which
did
not
involve
a
carry-over
but
which
involved
a
tax
benefit,
which
prior
to
the
merger
adhered
to
the
component
corporation.
and
the
expression
used
by
this
court
was
that
the
concept
of
the
merger
is
such
that
the
corporate
identity
of
each
component
is
drowned
in
the
personality
of
the
survivor
or
absorbed.
it's
--
to
be
sure
it's
a
metaphor,
it's
a
tenuous
concept
but
it
nevertheless
is
a
well-recognized
concept.
and
so
that,
we
feel
that
that
in
itself
is
the
answer
to
the
first
class
that's
over
the
government's
objection.
the
objection,
you
do
not
have
the
taxpayer
who
suffered
the
loss.
now,
to
be
sure,
the
government
does
press
its
second
facet
and
the
reason
it
does
express
it
is
because
it
feels
that
the
second
facet
enables
it
to
distinguish
newmarket,
for
example,
which
did
not
involve
the
problem
of
--
of
the
operation
of
--
of
different
assets
by
the
surviving
corporation
from
those
who
are
operated
by
the
component.
now,
there
was
only
one
operating
corporation
in
that
case.
but
now,
we
feel
that
the
government's
continuity
argument
is
also
--
can
be
--
can
also
be
answered
if
we
consider
it
carefully.
the
--
the
argument
in
the
brief
was
really
made
with
three
different
levels.
the
government
begins
by
pointing
to
the
committee
report,
the
1939
committee
report,
which
was
issued
in
connection
with
this
enactment
of
this
legislation
and
it
picks
up
a
quotation
to
the
effect
that
this
statute,
the
section
122,
permits
a
business
to
average
its
income
over
a
period
of
years
for
tax
purposes.
and
the
government
suggests
that
the
intention
was
to
limit
the
right
to
the
carry-over
to
that
situation.
the
--
but
it
is
submitted
that
that
is
of
course
the
most
irritable
case,
the
ordinary
case
uncomplicated
by
any
form
of
statutory
reorganization
for
the
merger
or
otherwise.
and
to
be
sure,
if
john
jones
operates
a
business
and
suffers
losses
in
the
year
one,
the
statute
permits
him
to
carry
over
those
losses
and
offset
them
against
profits
earned
in
year
two.
but
certainly,
that
is
not
the
limit
of
the
--
that
was
conferred
by
the
statute.
we
may
consider
the
next
case.
the
case
where
(a)
one
operator,
a
corporation
or
otherwise
has
two
separate
businesses
in
the
sense
of
two
different
accounting
unit,
different
operation,
perhaps
a
shoe
store
and
--
and
some
other
kind
of
a
store.
now,
it
--
it
may
be
asked
in
such
a
case
which
is
the
next
most
advanced
case.
can
he
offset
the
losses
of
one
of
these
accounting
units
against
the
profits
of
another?
can
he
carry
forward
the
losses
and
allow
such
as
against
the
profits
for
the
other
in
the
subsequent
hearing?
and
the
government,
in
its
brief,
is
compelled
to
answer
that
it
--
that
it
make.
well,
the
government
indeed
has
argued
that
that
too
is
improper.
but
even
the
tax
court
as
without
any
deviation
rejected
the
notion.
if
there
is
anything
in
the
statute
which
associates
the
right
to
the
carry-over
with
their
particular
business
operation.
the
statute
is
termed
in
--
phrased
in
terms
of
the
taxpayer.
so
that
really,
the
--
the
only
issue
here
is
whether
we
are
correct
in
our
proposition
that
the
petitioner
is
the
taxpayer
with
respect
to
the
losses
of
each
of
the
components.
now
then,
if
i
may
continue
the
same
analysis
then
i'll
bring
you
on
something
that
was
developed
earlier.
put
the
case
of
a
--
of
a
reorganization,
a
merger
in
which
as
one
of
the
justices
suggested,
the
--
the
surviving
corporation
is
the
loss
corporation,
the
corporation
which
prior
to
the
merger
has
the
losses.
counsel
for
the
government
was
compelled
to
admit
that
there
is
no
question
but
what
under
the
very
words
of
the
statute,
the
carry-over
would
be
allowed
in
such
a
case
because
the
surviving
corporation
is
--
he
has
to
admit
the
taxpayer
apart
from
the
fact
that
it
may
be
in
such
a
case
that
the
process
of
the
subsequent
juror
against
which
this
surviving
corporation
is
going
to
accept
the
earlier
losses,
are
not
derived
from
assets
which
were
formally
operated
by
that
loss
corporation
but
were
derived
from
other
assets
that
were
formally
operated
by
the
component
corporations.
it's
just
a
converse
of
our
case.
as
justice
harlan
indicated,
it
would
seem
to
be
a
ridiculous
artificiality
to
think
that
congress
would
contemplate
that
result
and
at
the
same
time
contemplate
the
--
the
opposite
result
in
the
--
in
the
case
at
bar.
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
no,
sir.
i
didn't
mean
to
quote
you,
paraphrasing
it
and
practically
carried
away
to
a
point.
now,
that
is
--
that
is
one
way
in
which
the
government
has
tried
to
develop
as
argument
of
--
of
the
second
facet
of
its
case.
the
other
level
at
which
it
has
argued
this
facet
is
the
level
of
the
decided
cases.
here,
it
has
pointed
to
the
case
of
new
colonial
ice
company
and
picked
up
the
phrase
"continuity
of
business"
that
was
used
in
that
--
by
the
court
in
that
case.
that
case
if
you
will
recall
was
a
case,
is
the
case
--
not
a
merger
but
of
a
reorganization
which
a
--
in
which
a
new
corporation
was
formed.
and
the
court
--
and
the
supreme
court
in
that
case
made
it
very
clear
that
the
reason
why
the
carry
over
was
not
allowed
was
because
there
was
a
new
corporation
formed,
and
because
it
was
not
a
statutory
merger.
the
language
used
was,
"this
transfer
was
not
by
operation
of
law
but
by
contract,
therefore,
you
do
not
have
the
same
taxpayer
the
second."
and
thus,
clearly
distinguishing
our
case.
now,
that
phrase
"continuity
of
business"
was
taken
out
of
context.
the
government
argues
that
since
the
phrase
"continuity
of
business"
was
used
there,
do
not
necessarily
mean
something
that
is
not
present
here,
but
it's
not
true.
it's
submitted
that
there's
continuity
of
business
here
in
the
same
sense
in
which
there
was
continuity
of
business
in
that
case.
the
sense
in
which
the
term
was
used
there
was
this.
the
business
operations
formerly
conducted
by
the
loss
corporation
continued
to
be
conducted
by
the
new
corporation.
continuity
in
that
sense.
now,
in
the
same
sense,
there
is
continuity
here
because
the
surviving
corporation
continues
to
operate
the
business
assets
formerly
operated
by
the
three
loss
corporations.
the
fact
that
it
also
operates
additional
assets
formerly
operated
by
other
components
does
detract
from
the
argument
that
there
is
continuity
of
the
operation
of
the
business
which
would
result.
and
in
the
same
way,
the
government
picks
up
a
phrase
in
the
stanton
brewery
case
in
its
brief,
the
phrase
"continuity
of
enterprise,"
and
suggests
again
that
it
means
identity
of
enterprise,
identity
of
scope
of
the
business
before
and
after
of
the
business
which
produced
losses.
and
that
against
those
profits
the
losses
are
upsetting.
again,
that
is
demonstrative
false
analysis.
and
then
turning
to
the
final
level
of
the
government's
argument
and
this
is
something
that
i
really
want
to
mention
because
it
again
has
been
brought
out
by
counsel
for
the
government
here.
well,
the
concept
of
tax
avoidance
is
introduced
and
it's
quite
extraneous.
it's
evident
from
the
record
that
there
is
no
question
of
tax
avoidance
here.
counsel
suggests
that
if
this
result
is
permitted
to
obtain,
there
is
a
tax
avoidance
problem
which
this
court
must
take
responsibility
for.
of
course
he
himself
admits
that
it
is
--
even
if
he
sees
it,
it's
narrow
in
scope
because
the
1954
legislation
allows
the
carry-over
in
this
very
situation,
so
it
would
apply
only
two
years,
affected
by
the
1939
code.
but
over
and
above
that,
congress
in
the
1939
code
in
section
129,
addressed
itself
for
the
very
problem
of
tax
avoidance
which
might
be
inherent
in
this
situation
when
it
provided
that
when
an
outsider
steps
in
and
acquires
a
lost
corporation,
when
new
interest
come
into
the
picture
and
acquire
a
loss
corporation
for
a
purpose
of
tax
avoidance,
then
a
loss
carry-over
is
not
permitted.
and
there
--
there
of
course
--
of
course
there's
no
such
case
here
as
we
have
no
change
in
ownership,
no
question
of
outside
interest
acquiring
a
--
a
business
for
the
purpose
of
utilizing
that
loss.
so
that
again,
the
government's
argument
at
the
level
of
the
appeal
to
--
to
some
concept
of
justice
and
tax
avoidance
is
without
merit.
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
i
believe
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
under
the
application
section
129.
if
there
is
a
substantial
change
in
stock
ownership
of
a
corporation
and
if
the
acquisition
of
the
corporation
by
the
new
interest
is
for
a
purpose
of
tax
avoidance
because
of
the
two
conditions,
then
the
loss
carry-over
is
not
permitted.
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
that's
correct.
and
in
that
same
--
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
under
the
language
of
section
129,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
no,
your
honor.
now,
there
may
be
some
other
things.one
thing
was
mentioned,
another
conclusion.
it
was
pointed
out
that
learned
hand
had
dissented
in
the
stanton
brewery
case.
the
fact
is
that
his
dissent
was
not
based
upon
a
rejection
of
the
same
taxpayer
argument
which
was
advanced
by
counsel
for
the
taxpayer
in
that
case.
his
dissent
was
based
upon
consideration
of
other
statutes
which
affected
the
problem
of
excess
profits
tax
credit
carry-over
and
which
do
not
affect
the
problem
of
net
operating
loss
carry-over.
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
it
applies
to
individuals
of
those
corporations,
your
honor.
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
the
right
to
the
carry-over
attaches
to
the
--
to
the
taxpayer
who
has
sustained
the
loss
in
the
first
instance.
if
an
individual
for
a
given
taxable
year
has
sustained
a
loss,
that
loss
is
a
--
is
the
carry-over
to
that
individual.
now,
there
is
no
way
--
no
theory
of
law
that
by
which
--
by
which
we
can
identify
a
corporation
organized
by
him
with
that
individual.
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
that's
correct
your
honor.
we
do
not
pretend
that
the
term
"taxpayer"
encompasses
that
type
of
a
change.
however,
because
of
the
doctrine
of
statutory
merger,
we
--
we
contend
that
the
--
that
document
itself
takes
us
over
the
bridge,
so
to
speak,
of
this
problem
with
the
same
taxpayer.
a
word
from
the
government
says
that
--
that
it's
resolving
a
question
by
means
of
resort
to
state
law,
but
we
do
not
see
it
that
way.
as
counsel
for
petitioner
pointed
out
in
the
first
part
--
part
of
our
argument,
it
is
not
that
case
at
all
because
the
internal
revenue
code
itself,
the
whole
code
necessarily
incorporates
the
--
the
private
corporation
law
of
the
several
states
whenever
it
speaks
for
the
corporation.
and
it
incorporates
--
the
corporation
law
for
that
purpose,
it
must
be
incorporated
for
the
purpose
of
the
--
of
statutory
merger
which
is
a
familiar
concept
and
which
is
used
in
the
code
without
definition.
the
code
in
the
reorganization
section
includes
the
statutory
merger
as
one
of
the
kinds
of
reorganization,
a
tax-free
reorganization
without
bothering
to
define
the
term.
so
that,
it
is
a
familiar
concept
and
the
notion
that
we
are
permitting
state
law
to
govern
tax
consideration
is
not
found.
it
was
suggested
by
one
of
the
justices
that
the
result
here
may
be
improper
and
that
individuals
could
not
avail
themselves
of
these
tax
benefits
in
a
comparable
situation.
of
course,
there
is
no
law
of
merger
of
individual
which
distinguishes
that
case.
there
is
a
law
of
statutory
merger
of
