you
said
that
as
new
units
came
into
being,
they
were
incorporated
as
it
were,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
corporation
for
each
new
unit,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
time
to
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
--
was
there
--
were
there
any
considerations
in
the
corporate
law
that
prevented
the
existing
--
the
existing
corporations
from
--
of
having
the
new
units
come
under
the
umbrella
of
the
old
corporations?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now,
at
least,
these
new
corporations
came
into
existence
for
business
reasons.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that's
really
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
--
was
it
absorption
really.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

consolidate
--
it
wasn't
consolidated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
main
stream.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
it
merely
--
it
wasn't
tax
avoidance
they
are
entitled
to
avoid
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
merely
talk
about
your
words.
if
it's
an
avoidance
then
it's
on
the
right
side
of
the
line?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
this
isn't
the
question
--
this
--
our
problem
is
fully
unrelated
to
the
legitimacy.
they're
doing
business
in
17
corporation.
that's
--
that's
--
that
isn't
a
--
have
something
to
do
with
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
--
this
17
cooperation
--
and
you
say
they
did
business
in
17
corporations
and
when
they
shrink
at
their
own,
it
isn't
the
same
thing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
isn't
referred
--
doesn't
regard
it
as
an
entity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
taxable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
i
understand
you,
mr.
stull,
to
say
that
during
the
life
of
this
marketable
corporation,
a
consolidated
income
tax
could
have
been
filed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
which
the
losses
and
the
credits
--
the
losses
and
gains
could
have
been
offset
and
all
these
things
could
have
been
then
claimed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
did
not
do
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
a
part
of
individual
reports
with
their
individual
gains
and
losses.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
i
mean
those
incitements.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
argument
mean
that
if
a
primary
corporation,
privately
--
privately
held
shares
becomes
a
public
corporation
that
your
argument
impose?
justice
felix
frankfurter
generally
speaking?
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
this
family
is
--
is
a
family
with
a
large
(inaudible)
nephews
and
nieces
have
a
loss
and
if
(inaudible)
that's
admitted
or
was
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
under
your
argument.
that
under
your
argument,
it
wouldn't
have
had
to
do
it.
