justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
lowenhaupt,
were
the
17
corporations
--
they
all
brought
into
being
the
same
as
to
all
four
of
them
for
the
initial
enterprise?
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
you
suggesting
--
i
just
want
to
make
sure
i
follow
you,
that
if
you
wipeout
the
somewhat
artificial
test
between
the
merger
and
other
forms
of
reorganization
and
look
at
it
in
the
more
realistic
ways
to
whether
that
is
continuity,
is
that
your
suggestion
as
to
the
basic
test
that's
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
involved.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that
leads
me
to
ask
this
question
then.
i
take
it,
as
i
understand
the
situation,
before
the
merger
of
the
16
corporations,
the
three
corporations
has
had
not
net
operating
losses,
could
not
have
taken
any
net
operating
loss
deduction
because
of
their
--
they
had
no
income.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
yes,
but
as
of
the
year
prior
to
the
merger,
there
wasn't
any
tax
benefit
that
would
accrue
to
them.
justice
john
m.
harlan
therefore,
when
you
think
of
it
in
terms
of
continuity,
is
it
not
a
fact
that
as
a
result
of
the
merger,
there
was
a
net
operating
loss
deduction,
a
tax
benefit
that
came
into
being
as
a
result
of
the
merger
which
did
not
exist
before.
and
my
question
is
whether
that
doesn't
break
the
chain
of
continuity?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
wasn't
the
--
didn't
those
three
units
continue
to
suffer
losses
during
the
succeeding
years?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
what
was
bothering
me
was
this,
that
if
you
take
the
continuity
test
and
you
answered
that
as
of
the
time
of
the
merger,
you
couldn't
foresee
what
that
operation
should
be
in
future
years.
in
fact,
in
future
years,
the
operation
has
altered,
there's
a
loss
of
these
three
stores
with
that
singly.
and
therefore,
doesn't
it
remain
true
that
the
tax
benefit
came
into
--
came
into
being,
came
into
existence
only
as
a
result
of
the
merger?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
what
respect,
mr.
stull,
were
the
business
purposes
of
the
resulting
corporation
changed
or
added
to
the
use?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
you
mentioned
it.
that's
the
reason
i
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
so,
i
understood
that
the
original
before
the
merger,
the
--
what
was
then
the
management
company
had
in
its
charter
powers
to
engage
in
operation.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
the
only
result
of
the
merger
was
to
bring
those
powers
into
being
and
became
an
operating
company
instead
of
a
management
company,
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
put
--
put
--
putting
in
a
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question
that
maybe
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
a
little
extraneous
but
--
you're
familiar
with
the
newmarket
case
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
in
which
the
--
as
the
chief
justice
announces
the
brief
today
that
was
filed
here
in
light
of
this.
as
you
can
--
are
you
familiar
with
the
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
can
see
that
the
result
of
both
these
cases
has
to
--
they
have
to
stand
up
altogether.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
don't
want
to
argue
--
i
don't
want
to
argue
the
newmarket
with
you
but
i
suggest
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
suggest
--
i
say
i
don't
want
to
argue
newmarket
with
you,
but
i
suggest
that
as
far
as
your
continuity
test
is
concerned
which
is
your
second
facet,
you
had
a
quite
a
different
problem
in
newmarket
than
the
one
you
have
here.
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
because
the
newmarket
simply
change
your
domicile.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so,
you
have
to
rest,
it
seems
to
me,
there
and
squarely
on
the
proposition
of
the
difference
between
a
--
the
different
corporate
entities
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
technical
corporate
entity.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes
and
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'd
like
to
ask
you
one
question
if
i
may,
mr.
stull,
under
your
taxpayer
theory,
the
first
face
to
your
argument.
take
two
corporations
a
and
b,
b
has
losses,
net
operating
losses.
if
a
merges
into
b
under
your
theory,
would
the
merged
corporation
be
entitled
to
take
the
operating
loss
deduction?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
there
would
be
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
alright.
yes,
i'm
not
thinking
about
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so,
your
answer
would
be,
they
could
say
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i'm
taking
back
the
same
situation.
reverse,
b
has
the
losses
and
it
merges
into
a,
could
it
take
the
--
a
corporation
take
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
is
not
a
pretty
artificial
kind
of
a
concept
to
attribute
to
congress?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
there's
been
a
change
of
tax
--
taxpayer
because
the
lawyer
could
have
paid
for
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
is
simply
because
of
the
happenstance
if
the
papers
are
going
one
way
rather
than
the
other.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you
don't
have
to
stand
on
that
as
i
understand
it.
you
--
you
could
say
no,
there's
another
question
about
here
and
absolutely
there's
a
continuity,
the
continuity
test
to
satisfy
it
too.
and
if
the
continuity
test
would
satisfy,
i
would
suppose
you'd
say
that
result
in
both
cases
ought
to
be
the
same.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
mean
in
formal
sense?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
didn't
say
ridiculous.
