does
that
mean
they
were
subsidiaries?

stanley

you
don't
mean
that,
do
you?

16
of
that.
now,
each
--
each
of
the
16,
what
about
the
stockholders?
justice
stanley
reed
it's
the
three
--
three
individuals
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
owned
all
of
the
stock
in
the
17
different
corporations?
justice
stanley
reed
the
three
of
it
in
the
same
proportion.
justice
stanley

(voice

--
justice
stanley
reed
well
i
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
i
thought
you
said
it
was
a
new
corporation.
it's
formed
to
take
over
the
17.
justice
stanley
reed
there
was
--
there
was
--
created
the
new
corporation.
justice
stanley
reed
then
--
then
i
misunderstood
that
there
was
not
a
new
corporation
created
after
the
--
or
for
the
merger.
justice
stanley
reed
it
was
a
consolidation
of
those
that
--
that
had
existed,
four
into
one.
justice
stanley
reed
which
--
which
--
before
we
get
into
that,
which
--
which
state
was
the
surviving
corporation?
missouri
or
--
justice
stanley
reed
and
there's
--
there's
no
question
about
the
validity
of
the
merger
into
it?
justice
stanley
reed
yet,
the
illinois
corporations
left
illinois
when
they
were
merged
into
the
(voice

--
justice
stanley
reed
what
--
what
became
of
the
older
corporation
in
the
--
in
the
colonial
ice
case?
justice
stanley
reed
just
as
a
shell?
justice
stanley
reed
that
means
it
was
not
dissolved?
justice
stanley
reed
what
was
the
fiscal
year?
did
he
--
all
of
these
corporations
--
justice
stanley
reed
so,
this
is
at
the
end
of
the
fiscal
year
when
the
results
were
known
for
the
preceding
year?
justice
stanley
reed
as
of
the
end
of
the
fiscal
year
for
all?
justice
stanley
reed
but
do
you
think
that
affects
your
argument
in
any
way?
justice
stanley
reed
that's
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
that's
a
purely
a
business
accident,
isn't
it?
evidently,
they
expected
to
make
a
profit
out
of
it
or
as
counsel
preceding
have
said
they
wouldn't
have
continued
those
locations.
justice
stanley
reed
and
--
and
you
think
that's
objection?
justice
stanley
reed
even
though
the
same
people
only
take
all
the
risks
in
all
the
different
corporations?
justice
stanley
reed
but
you
can
go
from
an
individual
to
a
partnership?
justice
stanley
reed
but
it
looks
through
it.
justice
stanley
reed
well,
why
--
why
did
you
say
--
justice
stanley
reed
as
i
understand
it,
the
operating
company
was
chosen
as
the
--
justice
stanley
reed
yes,
the
management
company
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
were
all
the
same
thing
to
me.
is
there
any
difference
between
the
operating
and
the
management?
justice
stanley
reed
based
on
how
you
use
the
word
"operating"
i
suppose?
justice
stanley
reed
but
anyway,
it
--
it
continued.
justice
stanley
reed
--
to
--
to
(voice

--
justice
stanley
reed
and
had
been
before.
justice
stanley
reed
before,
and
what
are
the
--
justice
stanley
reed
and
when
--
and
the
assets
in
the
business
and
the
others
simply
passed
it
to
them
by
merger.
now,
what
i'm
coming
to,
is
there
a
provision
in
the
tax
laws
in
regard
to
the
effect
of
mergers
not
--
not
related
to
the
carry-over
but
as
allowing
mergers?
justice
stanley
reed
by
the
states.
justice
stanley
reed
unless
--
unless
by
this
provision
here
where
--
unless
if
you
had
a
continuous
existence
of
the
two
or
the
16
corporations
here
then
--
then
it
would
apply.
justice
stanley
reed
well,
that's
what
they're
trying
to
do
here
as
i
understand
it.
justice
stanley
reed
but
when
they
merged,
i
don't
just
see
why
one
continues
and
one
not
because
of
the
names
that's
chosen
or
--
or
all
the
assets,
all
the
liabilities
of
the
old
corporation
passed
that
had
been
used
and
they
don't
pass
it
by
sale
but
by
merger.
doesn't
everyone
of
those
17
continue
as
a
part
of
the
new
merger?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
in
affects
on
whether
there
are
continues
existence
of
the
former
16,
doesn't
it?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
i
should
think
it's
the
corporation
itself.
justice
stanley
reed
does
the
--
doesn't
it
depend
on
whether
the
pre-existing
corporations
continue
with
the
liability
and
responsibility
after
the
merger?
justice
stanley
reed
if
the
16
corporations
that
were
merged
into
the
new
one,
doesn't
the
new
one
assume
all
the
liabilities
and
is
liable
(voice

--
justice
stanley
reed
--
to
the
others?
justice
stanley
reed
but
why
don't
the
16
continue
with
their
liabilities
and
obligations
continues?
justice
stanley
reed
yes.
justice
stanley
reed
so,
by
the
--
so
by
that
merger,
you
destroy
the
opportunity
of
the
--
those
that
had
a
loss
before
to
ever
regain
anything
from
it.
justice
stanley
reed
there's
--
there's
no
legislative
history
on
this
merger
of
aspect
exactly?
justice
stanley
reed
but,
since
the
--
since
the
days
of
gregory
white
versus
helvering
or
helvering
versus
gregory,
i
forgot
which,
you
had
these
merger
provisions
in
other
phases
have
to,
so
to
speak.
justice
stanley
reed
does
carry-back
carry
over
a
bargain
like
in
corporations
or
as
an
individual
(inaudible)
justice
stanley
reed
do
they
have
any
problems
for
the
--
the
individual
may
organize
a
corporation
and
take
over
his
business?
justice
stanley
reed
even
though
it
took
over
the
same
grocery
store
to
be
