whatever
--
whatever
rules
you
adopt
or
whatever
basis
you
put
it
on,
as
i
gather
from
your
answers,
a
merger
of
this
kind
would
result
either
in
a
tax
advantage
to
the
merged
company
or
to
a
tax
disadvantage
to
the
merged
company.
it
would
not
remain
the
same
if
there
was
some
losses,
losses
in
some
of
the
merged
companies
and
gains
on
the
others.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
was
--
i'm
--
i'm
talking
about
--
but
could
--
could
--
is
it
possible
that
if
you
have
10
corporations
or
16
or
whatever
it
is,
and
you
have
four
of
them
that
have
losses
and
the
rest
have
gains.
is
it
possible
to
merge
that
in
such
a
way
that
the
tax
situation
wouldn't
be
changed
over
--
from
what
it
had
--
would
have
been
had
they
remained
unmerged?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
your
argument
--
your
argument
means
if
they've
adapted
and
maybe
it's
right,
that
--
by
a
merger
such
as
you
had
here,
the
--
if
the
--
shows
to
be
done,
there
can
be
a
tax
advantage
result
--
has
to
be
a
tax
advantage
or
tax
disadvantage
result
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
whether
with
some
gains
and
some
losses
among
the
companies.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
absent
of
merger.
let's
suppose,
now
absent
the
merger
here,
the
tax
would
remain
precisely
as
congress
had
--
wouldn't
it,
could
it
not?
the
results
would
be
the
same
that
congress
had
provided
for.
forget
there's
a
merger.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
had
--
had
no
merger
and
then
you
could
administer
the
tax
law
in
accordance
with
the
provision
that
--
as
the
way
they're
written,
but
the
other
permits
the
merger
to
alter
the
tax
results.
justice
hugo
l.

suppose
there
had
been
seven
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
there
had
been
17
individuals
who
had
been
doing
business
for
two
years,
some
have
been
in
losses
and
carry-over
and
so
forth.
when
they
organized,
they
decided
to
put
all
of
them
in
one
corporation,
what
would
have
been
the
result
of
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
there
were
taxable
entities
in
there,
aren't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
they
were
entirely
different
taxable
income?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
question
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
had
suppose
--
i
thought
there
was
a
--
the
court
ruled
an
opinion
some
years
ago
to
the
effect
because
as
they
chose
to
do
business,
this
corporate
entity,
and
get
tax
to
corporate
entities,
they
were
taxed
as
corporate
entities.
justice
hugo
l.
black
higgins
against
smith,
as
i
recall
it,
was
the
case
that's
in
there,
something
like
that.
did
you
cite
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
say
that
the
law
doesn't
allow
17
individuals
to
shrink
their
tax
--
taxability
into
one
corporation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
don't
survive
under
the
name
of
a,
but
they
do
survive
under
the
name
of
g
or
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
the
state
law
continue
their
tax
obligations
or
do
away
with
their
tax
obligations?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
could
understand
how
the
state
law
can
fix
the
contract
between
private
partners,
say
that
if
you
merge,
you're
not
going
to
be
allowed
to
defeat
your
obligations
nor
must
you
to
take
on
more.
you
continue
the
old
just
as
much
as
you
did
before.
you
can
get
paid
as
much
as
you
could
before
in
existing
obligations
between
private
partners.
but
does
that
result
tax-wise
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
adopt
the
conceptualistic
idea
that
these
16
corporations
that
have
somehow
been
--
this
used
to
be
and
now
still
existing
in
some
way
and
the
concepts
are
divine.
but
do
they
continue
as
they
would
as
between
private
contract,
private
contracts
that
will
had
to
be
paid
in
full?
but
would
the
government
get
its
full
tax
it
would
have
gotten
at
these
conceptualistic
corporations
not
changed
there,
somehow
the
invisibility
or
visibility?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
right.
then,
what
--
the
effect
of
this
would
be
that
the
government
will
not
--
that
these
corporations
will
not
have
to
--
do
not
continue
with
the
same
obligations
that
they
had
before
and
now
with
the
same
benefit.
because
when
they
merged,
that
changes
the
tax
situation
and
changes
the
obligation,
but
that
wouldn't
happen
with
the
reference
to
the
--
the
part
of
the
activities
of
the
state
governments,
would
it,
as
between
private
partners?
the
obligations
would
neither
be
increased,
nor
--
or
--
nor
diminished.
but
here,
you
would
change
the
obligation
as
between
--
after
this
occurred
according
to
the
arguments
made
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean,
you
do
with
the
government.
you
do
what
they
did?
they
choose
to
give
it
up.
i
--
i
don't
quite
understand
where
--
where
do
they
have
that
you
do
it
as
the
government.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
that
the
--
you
say
that
the
law
gives
corporation
as
such
the
rights
within
their
own
area
of
what
they
owe
and
what
they
don't
owe
and
so
forth,
state
certain
tax
deductions,
and
they
can't
change
it
by
merging
three
or
four
into
one.
