unknown
speaker
but
the
effect
of
your
interpretation
would
then
say
that
congress
was
encouraging
communists
to
register
but
never
mind
about
the
prosecution
of
them
for
membership.
unknown
speaker
but
not
under
the
membership
clause.
unknown
speaker
and
they
wouldn't
be
registered
because
they
have
this
protection
that
they're
registered.
unknown
speaker
but
can
they
explain
that
they
did
that
in
order
that
they
might
get
them
registered?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
very
ones
they
wanted
to
get
registered
were
those
that
were
under
the
membership
clause
of
the
smith
act,
weren't
they?
they're
the
ones
that
they
wanted
to
get
down
on
paper.
unknown
speaker
but
they
wanted
to
reach
some

the

they
want
to
reach
something
that
they
could
prosecute,
didn't
they?
unknown
speaker

but
they
prosecute
them
for
the
conspiracy
and

unknown
speaker
they
get
them
registered
as
members
and
prosecute
them
for
the
conspiracy.
unknown
speaker
but
why
--
why
do
say
it
would
follow?
unknown
speaker
even
if
he
register
--
unknown
speaker
even
if
he
registered,
it
--
it
could
not
be
used
against
him
in
any
prosecution.
unknown
speaker
if
you
--
if
you
concede
that
that
if
he
claimed
his
privilege
against
registration,
why
could
he
--
how
could
he
claim
a
privilege
when
the
registration
could
do
nothing
towards
his
conviction?
unknown
speaker
do
you
draw
the
intent
to
your
character
of
the
organization
knowing
the
character
of
the
organization
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
to
urge
--
unknown

what
