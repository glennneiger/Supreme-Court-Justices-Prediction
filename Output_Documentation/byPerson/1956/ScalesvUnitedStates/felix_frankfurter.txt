justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
take
a
minute
to
state
the
--
what
you
call
statutory
question.
that
isn't
a
question
of
criminal
pleading,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
taylor,
i
don't
quite
--
i'm
not
sure
i
understand.
is
it
your
contention
that
congress
cannot
constitutionally
say
that
anyone
who
is
a
member
of
an
organization
that
seeks
to
destroy
the
government
by
force
and
violence
must
be
guilty
of
an
offense?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
my
--
my
question
is
just,
i
want
to
know
whether
if
you
are
referring
to
the
powers
of
congress
to
make
it
a
defense,
deals
to
be
member,
although,
a
member
never
opens
his
mouth,
never
likes
to
lie,
leave
the
membership
in
an
organization
which
is
considered
to
the
purpose
of
the
law
dedicated
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
asking
is
whether
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that
is
in
this
case,
where
does
this
differ?
justice
felix
frankfurter
advocate
is
not
--
not
the
--
entertaining
the
idea
of
advocacy
the
accomplishment
of
that
purpose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
get
valid
treatment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
assuming
however
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
court
has
proven
the
problem,
the
difficulty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
not
one
way
rather
than
the
other.
can
you
say
that
the
proscribed
membership
in
such
an
organization
which
make
such
an
organization
possible
of
rejecting
before
this
trial,
a
participation
by
people?
does
that
sometimes
(inaudible)
although
those
who
manipulate
the
organization
maybe
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
case
i've
put
to
you
doesn't
involve
any
speech
at
all,
it's
a
--
its
merely
--
the
question
i
want
to
raise
is
whether
the
inarticulate
members
would
--
must
qualify
the
(inaudible)
as
my
question
presuppose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
that
is
not
tangible
by
congress
although
the
organization
bring
it
about
the
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
freedom
of
speech
is
involved.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
understand
the
problem
of
remoteness,
i
don't
understand
what
freedom
of
speech
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
understand
your
reply,
but
somehow
rather
somewhere
in
the
constitution
it's
explicitly
there
was
a
right
of
free
association.
but
i
--
my
trouble
is
and
i'd
like
to
read
the
constitution
not
as
a
congramurate
document,
but
something
that
binds
me
to
find
something
by
congress
that's
unconstitutional.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
difficulty
finding
free
speech
involved.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
taylor,
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
as
i
understand
your
argument
now
is
that
a
certain
interpolation
must
be
made
whether
having
the
solicitor
general
to
argue
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
in
terms
of
general
knowledge,
suggests
a
certain
interpolation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
purpose
of
(inaudible)
in
the
statute
did
report
in
his
charge
as
i
understand
what
(inaudible)
if
the
court
submits
to
the
bureau
a
meaning
of
the
statute
with
the
interpolation
with
the
solicitor
general
has
to
submit
to
it
all
the
(inaudible)
it
referred
to
the
district
court
in
this
case
on
a
different
assumption
of
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
that's
so
unless
i'm
very
wrong,
the
question
is
whether
it
should
or
it
shouldn't
be
but
didn't
and
that
is
the
--
the
verdict
must
be
judged
by
what
a
judge
--
by
a
trial
judge
trying
with
the
juror
(inaudible)
and
that
was
not
really
put
together.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
indictment,
more
or
less
is
having
turned
to
the
statute
so
that
it
would
give
a
--
it
would
give
a
leeway
for
the
charge
to
be
made
of
it,
but
the
scope
of
the
charge
is
vital
to
the
terms
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
the
government's
position
--
do
you
tell
the
government's
position
that
this
is
in
effect
an
indictment
of
likelihood
with
other
people
with
whom
it
is
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon,
scales.
justice
felix
frankfurter
more
or
less
the
statute
plainly
enough
made
a
differentiation
between
those
that
they
gave
room
and
prescribed
for
conspiring
and
organizing
each
exceptions
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
those
who
give
strength
to
the
organization
by
being
members
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
whatever
one
may
think
about
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
comments
off
it
to
make
those
two
categories.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
can't
say
that
every
member
and
everybody
who
--
who
is
a
member
of
the
communist
organization
in
view
of
the
nature
of
that
organization
is
a
conspirator.
that's
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
indictment
for
him,
the
judge
has
solely
charged.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
taylor,
at
the
time
this
indictment
was
filed,
the
smith
act
was
no
longer
the
smith
--
the
original
smith
act
was
not
a
provision
under
statute
rules,
wasn't
it?
that
it
is,
the
smith
act
and
that
kind
of
penal
code
is
categorized.the
smith
act
remained
an
independent
statute
in
whatever
department
it
was?
in
other
words
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
1948
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(a)
and
(b),
(a)
and
(c)
which
you
have
in
your
brief,
that
was
part
of
the
u.s.
code,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then,
there
was
a
later
provision
by
the
internal
security
act
into
law,
underwent
a
codification
in
1952.
what
i'm
asking
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
what
--
pardon
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
(inaudible)
it
wasn't
it
--
wasn't
all
this
then
the
provision
put
into
one
comprehensive
court
provision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
one
--
on
the
one
section
or
title
whatever
it
was.
and
if
so,
then
--
then
what
was
it
the
name
of
the
clause,
statutorily
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
that's
so,
it
--
it
seems
i'm
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
the
smith
act
didn't
close
out
there
by
itself
as
an
independent
statute,
but
is
imparted
by
this
collection
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
also
--
he
might
claim
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
and
to
put
concrete
that
this
was
put
in
so
in
this
case,
the
government
would
not
proceed
with
the
indictment
by
proving
to
obtain
the
members
of
the
communist
party
directly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
wasn't
that
true
of
the
smith
act?
they
--
they
couldn't
do
that
in
the
smith
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
how
could
it
(inaudible)
did
anybody
attempt
with
the
prosecution
under
the
smith
act,
i
mean
by
the
fact
that
knowledge
was
required.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
it's
a
question
of
safeguarding
opening
up
an
inquiry,
and
4
(f)
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i'm
not
talking
about
(inaudible)
it
seems
to
me,
(inaudible)
i
don't
see
how
they
accomplished
it
but
(inaudible)
by
4
(f)
in
which
--
which
would
be
(inaudible)
of
membership.
because
the
other
provision
of
the
smith
act
you
have
to
put
in
all
the
knowledge
in
passing,
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
how
about
--
how
would
that
come
to
be?
how
would
it
pay
if
this
--
what's
the
--
to
hold
that
if
it
leads
--
how
does
that
--
what
is
asked
anymore
than
by
--
by
just
saying
the
first
amendment
is
what
(inaudible)
in
other
words,
prosecution
under
the
smith
act?
that's
what
i
understand
on
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
(inaudible)
and
tell
me
what
your
view
is,
the
bearing
of
section
8
(b)
of
the
internal
security
act
which
makes
the
requirements
of
an
individual
acknowledge
the
organization.
each
individual
who
is
or
becomes
a
member
of
any
organization
(inaudible)
from
section
7
(a)
(inaudible)
that
you
have
failed
to
include
his
name
(inaudible)
required
to
register.
now,
there's
knowledge
in
the
fact
that
(inaudible)
protect
anybody
from
the
mere
fact
of
being
a
member
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
unless
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
the
--
that
what
you
indicate,
it
seems
to
be
a
(inaudible)
that
they
are
putting
a
(inaudible)
they're
not
concerned
(inaudible)
and
so
on.
they
weren't
concerned
with
it
because
really,
they
werent
concerned.
that
is
not
a
problem,
that
was
not
an
active
problem.
but
the
problem
--
but
the
control
of
the
communist
party
was
enacted
(inaudible)
namely,
it
should
go
out
to
the
policy.
that's
the
way
(inaudible)
--
don't
go
out
of
your
way
to
find
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that
you
read
the
statute
to
mean
that
he
must
have
shared
the
purposes
of
the
organization
(inaudible).
that's
what
it
all
gets
down
to?
justice
felix
frankfurter
having
to
be
a
matter
of
construction
of
the
statute
that
he
--
the
law
requires
that
he
should
know
--
that
he
should
have
joined
an
officer
knowing
that
the
organization
as
he
--
as
he
proscribed
these
illicit
purposes
and
that
he
shared
believing
this
purpose
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
i
don't
see
why.
this
would
just
start
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
cannot
call
membership
active
membership
from
(inaudible)
wants
to
bring
down
the
government
by
force.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
the
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
see.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it
doesn't
help
you
any.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
would
help
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor,
does
your
view
of
4
(f),
the
controversial
clause
gets
down
to
the
statement,
gets
down
to
this,
that
is
merely
a
declaratory
statement
by
congress?
justice
felix
frankfurter
anything
but
declaratory,
it
must
be
a
modification.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
there
anything
if
one
goes
beyond
the
statutory
language
and
i
know
there's
such
a
tendency
going
to
legislative
history
that
we
now
even
(inaudible)
experience
enable
counsel
to
begin
with
legislative
history
(inaudible)
if
one
goes
to
legislative
history
at
the
end
instead
at
the
beginning,
is
there
anything
which
discloses
(inaudible)
of
mind
on
the
part
of
congress
that
this
was
put
in
merely
out
of
an
abundance
of
courts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
the
history
legislation
had
been
made
a
declaratory
statement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
your
position
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
if
it's
anything
other
than
that,
it
must
be
a
modification.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
had
a
similar
problem
(inaudible)
with
regards
to
immigration
services
relying
on
the
statement
by
senator
mccarthy
that
membership
--
for
purpose
of
the
deportation
made
was
immigration
one
of
the
other,
i
ought
to
remember
but
i
don't,
that
it
--
it
must
--
there
must
be
activity
behind
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
all
events,
the
problem
put
by
my
brother
harlan
is
in
the
realm
of
the
scope
of
statutory
construction,
is
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
in
this
case,
this
--
this
is
not
that
case,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
spend
one-half
minute
on
17,
what
is
it?
the
--
the
section
17
on
which
--
which
is
what
the
basis
of
the
government's
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
that's
the
no
addition
and
modification.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
a
general
provision
(inaudible)
in
the
united
states
code.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
