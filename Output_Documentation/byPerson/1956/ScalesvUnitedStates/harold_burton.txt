and
yet
you
would
say
then
he
was
a
member
per
se?
justice
harold
burton
although
by
the
constitution,
he's
not
a
member.
justice
harold
burton
before
--
before
--
justice
harold
burton
--
you
leave
that
on,
is
--
is
it
--
it's
a
previous
question
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan,
is
it
for
that
reason
that
you
read
the
intent
to
this
membership
clause?
justice
harold
burton
i
understood
you
to
say
that
so
far
as
intent
was
concerned,
that
there
must
be
an
intent
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
--
of
the
party.
justice
harold
burton
but
now
if
the
member
is
purely
(inaudible)
member
such
as
(inaudible)
would
it
be
because
the
intent
was
not
--
he
could
not
read
the
intent
into
his
membership
that
he
would
not
be
liable
or
might
not
be?
