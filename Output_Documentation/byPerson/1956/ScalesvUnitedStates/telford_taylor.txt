mr.
telford
taylor
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
this
case
comes
up
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
it's
also
a
smith
act
case,
but
it
is
not
a
conspiracy
case.
and
it
comes
up
here
under
a
provision
of
the
smith
act
that
has
not
hitherto
then
before
this
court
for
review
and
consideration.
perhaps,
the
court
would
like
to
look
at
it
right
at
the
outset
and
my
brief
in
the
appendix
of
page
48
sets
forth
the
language
of
the
smith
act
showing
this
clause
and
its
context.
the
court
will
recall
that
there
are
three
basic
paragraphs
in
the
smith
act,
one
prohibiting
advocacy,
one
on
the
distribution
of
literature,
and
one
on
organizing
groups.
and
the
conspiracy
cases
that
have
hitherto
come
here
have
been
for
conspiracy
to
violate
the
first
and
third
paragraphs
on
advocacy
and
organizing.
the
clause
for
this
action
that
this
case
comes
under
is
the
last
clause
of
the
third
paragraph.and
eliminating
the
part
about
organizing,
which
is
not
relevant
here.
it
reads,
"whoever
becomes
or
is
a
member
of
or
affiliates
with
any
such
society,
group
or
assembly
of
persons,
knowing
the
purposes
thereof
shall
be
fined,
imprisoned
and
so
forth."
and
to
such
group
refers
back
to
the
same
groups
that
the
other
provisions
of
the
act
is
concerned,
group
of
persons
who
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
or
violence.
in
short,
this
clause
prescribes
being
a
member
of
a
group,
the
members
of
which
advocate
violent
overthrow
with
knowledge
that
that
is
the
purpose.
now,
your
honors,
this
case
involves
some
of
the
same
questions
that
you
have
heard
discussed
in
the
preceding
cases,
questions
such
as
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
about
the
communist
party,
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
about
an
individual's
connection
with
it.
but
the
court
has
heard
considerable
argument
on
these
points.
in
the
last
two
days,
though
not
quite
as
much
as
i
expected
this
morning
when
i
came
to
court,
and
for
that
reason
it
seems
to
me
that
it
might
be
best
for
me
to
go
immediately
to
the
new
questions
in
this
case
that
are
not
presented
in
the
prior
cases
because
there
are
new
constitutional
and
statutory
problems
arising
here
that
i
plan
to
focus
my
argument
upon.
there
is
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
this
membership
clause
on
its
space
and
as
applied
in
this
case.
the
--
to
state
very
briefly,
the
question
of
constitutionality
arises
because
this
contains
no
prohibition
of
advocacy
or
incitement
or
organizing
or
conspiring,
this
is
a
prohibition
of
status
plus
state
of
mind.
now
the
court
may
not
reach
that
question.
the
court
may
not
reach
it
because
there
is
a
statutory
question
here
too,
which
maybe
governing
and
the
court
may
prefer
to
approach
constitutional
questions
last
and
not
first
as
has
been
said.
and
that
question
is
whether
the
indictment
here
states
an
offense
against
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
it
arises
because
in
1950,
10
years
after
the
smith
act
was
passed,
congress
enacted
the
internal
security
act
of
1950
including
section
4
(f)
of
that
act
which
you
will
find
in
the
appendix
to
my
brief
at
page
49.
section
4
(f)
declares
that
neither
the
holding
of
office
nor
membership
in
any
communist
organization,
by
any
person,
shall
constitute
per
se
a
violation
of
subsection
(a),
or
subsection
(c)
of
this
section
or
of
any
other
criminal
statute.
now,
that
extension
of
the
bar,
whatever
the
bar
is,
to
any
other
criminal
statute,
it
is
my
argument
that
that
presently
bars
the
prosecution
of
communists
under
the
membership
clause
which
is
the
clause
that
this
case
comes
up
under.
whatever
might
be
its
effect
on
conspiracy
cases
that
has
an
effect
on
the
membership
clause
is
to
cut
off
the
prosecution
for
communists.
now,
after
stating
the
case,
i
propose
to
focus
my
argument
on
these
two
questions,
the
statutory
and
the
constitutional.
there
are
also
these
evidentiary
questions
which
are
raised
in
yates
and
--
and
were
raised
in
mesarosh.
and
if
time
permits,
i
will
say
a
few
words
about
those
as
well
as
about
the
points
relating
to
fair
trial.
mr.
telford
taylor
no.
it
is
a
question
of
--
of
limitation
of
the
scope
of
--
of
the
smith
act
by
virtue
of
a
subsequent
act.
it
is
not,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
a
repeal
of
that,
of
the
membership
clause
because
the
membership
clause
is
left
applicable
to
persons
belonging
to
other
organizations
than
a
communist
party,
that
is
assuming
it's
constitutional.
but
it
is
in
our
--
in
my
view
a
limitation
of
the
membership
clause
by
the
--
an
exclusionary
limitation,
an
exclusionary
limitation
of
communists.
now,
might
i
say
a
preliminary
word
on
the
government's
past
practice
in
the
enforcement
of
this
membership
clause
as
compared
to
its
enforcement
of
the
other
provisions
of
the
smith
act.
as
the
court
knows,
the
dennis
case
was
the
first
case
against
communists
under
the
smith
act.
the
defendants
there
were
indicted
not
only
in
a
single
indictment
for
a
conspiracy,
but
those
defendants
were
also
indicted
in
individual
indictments
under
this
same
membership
clause.
but
before
the
case
was
tried,
there
was
a
motion
to
sever
those
individual
indictments
under
the
membership
clause.
that
motion
is
granted
so
that
the
dennis
defendants
were
tried
only
under
the
conspiracy
indictment.
however,
those
membership
indictments
have
not
been
withdrawn,
despite
the
lapse
of
eight
years
since
1948.
those
membership
indictments
against
the
original
dennis
defendants
are
still
pending
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
although
there
has
never
been
any
trial
under
those
indictments.
now,
after
the
dennis
case,
the
government
brought
a
series
of
conspiracy
indictments
similar
to
dennis'
indictment,
similar
to
the
cases
that
were
here
the
last
two
days,
against
groups
of
communist
party
members
and
officers
in
various
cities.
those
cases,
those
indictments
all
were
laid
after
1950
and
therefore,
after
the
enactment
of
this
provision
from
the
internal
security
act
that
i've
just
read.
whether
or
not
that
was
the
reason,
i
do
not
know,
but
the
fact
is
that
in
those
subsequent
indictments,
they
did
not
undertake
to
indict
the
members
individually
under
the
membership
clause.
there's
the
fraenkel
case
in
baltimore
and
the
flynn
case
in
new
york
in
which
this
court
denied
certiorari.
then,
this
week,
we
have
had
the
yates
and
mesarosh
cases
and
none
of
those
cases
were
there
individual
indictments
under
the
membership
clause.
they
were
indicted
only
for
conspiracy,
and
that
insofar
as
i
know
remained
true
until
1954,
1954
was
the
first
occasion.
since
1948
when
those
original
membership
indictments
went
in
against
the
dennis
defendants,
it
was
the
first
occasion
that
the
government
again
sought
to
invoke
this
membership
clause
and
it
sought
it
in
this
case,
which
is
now
before
you,
and
in
the
lightfoot
case
coming
from
the
seventh
circuit,
which
is
on
argument
following
this
one.
only
this
case
and
the
lightfoot
case
under
the
membership
clause
have
been
reviewed
in
the
courts
of
appeal.
this
one
in
the
fourth
circuit,
lightfoot
in
the
seventh,
and
in
both
of
those
cases,
the
conviction
was
affirmed
and
it
was
held
that
the
act
was
constitutional
and
that
section
4
(f)
that
i
stressed
is
not
a
bar
to
prosecution.
now,
may
i
turn
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
which
i
can
state
quite
briefly
because
basically
the
questions
here
are
legal,
i
think.
the
petitioner,
scales,
was
indicted
on
november
18th
in
north
carolina,
federal
district
court.
the
indictment
is
found
on
page
1
of
the
record.
and
i
think
it
is
important
to
take
a
look
at
that,
because
much
of
the
argument
will
revolve
around
what
is
in
it
and
what
is
not
in
it.
it
is
a
very
short
and
simple
indictment
entirely
contained
on
that
first
page
and
it
alleges
four
things.
the
first
paragraph
alleges
that
the
communist
party
is
a
society
or
group
of
persons
who
teach
and
advocate
the
overthrow
of
government.
the
petitioner
undertook
to
deny
that
allegation.
then,
in
the
next
paragraph,
it
is
first
alleged
that
the
petitioner,
scales
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
that
he
did
not
undertake
to
deny
and
the
record
shows
that
he
is
an
officer
of
the
party
at
the
state
level.
he
is
not
a
national
officer.
he
is
chairman
of
the
party
in
north
carolina.
on
argument
in
the
yates
case,
government
counsel
analogized
these
cases
by
the
number
of
stars
the
generals
wore
on
their
shoulder.
i
do
not
know
how
many
stars
would
be
warranted
for
this
particular
office,
but
apart
from
that,
this
is
a
state
level
case,
nothing
higher.
then,
it
is
alleged
that
scales
knew
the
communist
party
to
be
a
group
that
advocates
overthrow
by
force
or
violence,
and
that
is
denied.
finally,
the
last
allegation
according
to
page
1
is
that
the
defendant
intended
to
bring
about
overthrow,
violent
overthrow,
as
speedily
as
circumstances
permit.
that
too
is
denied.
there
is
a
legal
question
as
to
whether
that
allegation
has
any
proper
place
in
the
indictment,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
membership
clause
specifies
that
membership
and
knowledge
says
nothing
about
intent,
and
i
will
discuss
that
question
in
due
course.
the
case
went
to
trial
in
april
of
last
year
and
scales
was
found
guilty.
he
got
his
six-year
in
jail
much
more
easily
than
mrs.
yates
did.
he
did
not
take
the
stand,
had
no
contempt
problem,
but
he
was
given
six
years
for
this
offense,
which
is
in
fact
a
year
more
than
any
other
defendant
in
the
smith
act
case
has
gotten.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
other
defendants
have
been
convicted
under
the
general
conspiracy
statute,
the
maximum
penalty
underwhich
until
recently
has
been
five
--
the
maximum
penalty
is
five
years.
whereas,
since
this
case
came
up
under
the
smith
act
itself
where
the
maximum
penalty
is
10
years,
he
could
be
given
a
longer
sentence
and
he
was.
the
case
was
--
the
conviction
was
affirmed
below
and
the
case
came
here
on
certiorari
last
march
on
four
stated
questions,
of
which
i
have
already
mentioned
two,
the
constitutionality
problem,
the
statutory
problem
under
4
(f)
of
the
internal
security
act,
a
question
whether
there
is
sufficient
evidence
of
the
party's
unlawful
aims
and
sufficient
evidence
of
scales's
guilty
knowledge
and
intent.
that
is
sufficient
to
go
to
the
jury
or
support
a
verdict.
and
finally,
there
are
four
questions
raised
about
the
conduct
of
the
trial
of
which
probably
the
two
most
important
are
the
method
of
impaneling
the
grand
jury
and
the
validity
of
certain
rulings
on
the
admissibility
of
evidence
which
mr.
donner
adverted
to
briefly
this
morning
in
discussing
the
questions
which
would
be
--
would
have
been
presented
under
the
mesarosh
case.
mr.
telford
taylor
there
are
no
questions
raised
on
certiorari
about
the
judge's
charge.
i
think,
your
honor,
probably
has
in
mind
the
problem
of
incitement
or
may
have
that
in
mind
which
is
discussed.
there
was
in
this
case,
unlike
the
yates
case
the
same
kind
of
a
charge
about
incitement
that
judge
medina
gave
in
the
dennis
case.
now,
might
i
say
a
few
words
about
the
evidence,
which
again
i
can
do
quite
briefly.
the
prosecution
called
only
three
witnesses
against
scales.
the
first
one
was
lautner,
john
lautner,
who
is
a
chronic
witness
in
these
cases
and
he
made
exactly
the
same
kind
of
testimony
as
far
as
i
know
that
he
has
given
in
the
others.
he
knew
nothing
about
scales,
did
not
purport
to
know
anything
about
petitioner.
he
testified
as
an
ex-member
of
the
communist
party
about
the
doctrinal
aims
of
the
party
from
which
incidentally
he
resigned
on
january
17th,
1950,
which
is
nearly
five
years
before
this
indictment
was
brought
and
about
two
years
before
the
statutory
period
of
limitations
under
this
indictment.
in
general,
he
--
he
identified
the
classical
writings
that
were
discussed
yesterday
with
marx,
lenin,
and
stalin.
he
testified
that
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states
where
in
its
constitution
or
in
other
writings,
it
claims
not
to
advocate
force
and
violence.
lautner
says
in
his
opinion
not
as
a
camouflage.
and
he
stated
that
marxism-leninism
essentially
means
overthrow
by
force
and
violence.
and
that
was
in
some
substance
of
lautner's
testimony.
the
other
two
witnesses
are
the
ones
who
testified
about
petitioner.
they
are
both
fbi
informants
who
joined
the
communist
party
by
prearrangement
with
the
fbi
to
observe
and
report
on
what
went
on.
the
first
being
a
witness
named
clontz
and
he
met
scales
in
1948,
which
again
is
a
long
time
before
the
indictment
of
statutory
period
and
was
in
contact
with
scales
until
december
1951,
which
is
just
barely
the
beginning
of
the
statutory
period.
he
testified
primarily
to
numerous
private
conversations
with
scales
in
which
scales
has
reported
to
have
made
statements
upon
which
the
government
relies
heavily
to
show
scales'
own
personal
belief
in
force
and
violence.
then,
the
third
witness,
childs,
another
fbi
informant,
sort
of
picks
up
chronologically
where
clontz
stopped.
he
was
in
contact
with
scales
during
the
statutory
period
and
attended
a
party
school
in
north
carolina
which
it
had
said
scales
was
the
director
of.
there
is
extensive
testimony
from
childs
on
what
was
taught
of
that
school.
on
the
record
of
his
testimony,
much
was
taught
there
that
it
is
certainly
highly
controversial,
certainly
highly
abhorrent
to
many
americans.
but
as
i
read
the
record,
there
is
no
showing
that
force
and
violence
was
part
of
the
school.
that
is
the
prosecutioner's
case.
as
to
the
defense,
the
petitioner
did
not
testify
and
the
evidence
given
in
his
behalf,
which
i
have
described
in
my
brief
for
the
information
of
the
court,
does
not
in
my
opinion
importantly
affect
the
issues
that
are
now
open
here
on
certiorari,
as
to
those
issues.
as
i
have
remarked,
the
court
may
not
have
to
reach
the
constitutional
question.
but
the
constitutional
and
the
statutory
question,
both
depend
on
a
careful
reading
of
this
membership
clause
to
see
what
is
in
it
and
what
isn't
in
it
and
i
think
it
will
be
clearer
if
i
tried
to
point
out
the
constitutional
issue
first
and
then
comes
the
statutory
question.
although,
your
honors,
may
well
decide
to
decide
the
case
in
reverse
order.
now,
on
constitutionality.
i
would
like
the
court
to
consider
just
what
the
membership
clause
as
applied
in
this
indictment,
seeks
to
imbue
with
a
criminal
seditious
character.
there
is
no
charge
in
this
case
that
the
--
that
scales
advocated
violent
overthrow
or
that
he
incited
anybody
to
violent
overthrow,
or
that
he
organized
any
group
which
was
dedicated
for
the
purpose
of
violent
overthrow.
there
is
no
charge
that
he
conspired
with
anyone
to
do
any
one
of
those
things.
there
is
in
fact
no
act
at
all
charged,
unless
remaining
a
member
of
the
party
during
the
statutory
period
maybe
considered
an
act.
there
is
no
concert
of
action,
no
agreement
with
anyone
else
charged
in
the
indictment
for
any
legal
or
illegal
purpose.
the
defendants
involved
in
the
conspiracy
cases
that
have
just
been
before
the
court,
after
all,
are
accused
of
being
co-conspirators
with
the
dennis
case
defendants
and
they
are
the
people
who
were
supposed
to
have
patched
this
conspiracy
in
1945,
and
they
are
the
leaders
of
the
party
that
is
said
to
be
the
vehicle
of
the
conspiracy.
it
is
not
my
responsibility
to
say
whether
that
accusation
is
--
is
substantiated
or
not.
however
that
may
be,
there
is
no
such
charge
in
this
case,
no
charge
of
conspiracy
with
anyone.
the
difference,
therefore,
between
this
case
and
the
dennis
case
in
terms
of
clear
and
present
danger
is
i
think
not
in
need
of
elaboration.
and
actually,
my
argument
with
the
solicitor
general
is
not
joined
on
the
basis
of
the
membership
clause
as
written,
because
as
i
read
his
brief,
he
does
not
undertake
to
defend
the
constitutionality
of
the
membership
clause
as
written.
he
undertakes
to
defend
it
by
reading
into
that
clause
a
great
deal
that
is
certainly
not
there
in
words
and
that
i
think
cannot
be
read
into
it
by
any
common
sense
implication.
mr.
telford
taylor
this
is
not
a
statute,
your
honor,
that
punishes
conspiracies
to
destroy
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
i
can
only
repeat,
your
honor
that
i
don't
think
that
is
this
case.
mr.
telford
taylor
whether
it
would
be
my
opinion?
mr.
telford
taylor
this
differs
in
that
the
organization
here
is
charged
only
with
advocating
the
overthrow
by
force
and
violence.
there
is
a
quite
different
federal
statute
that
punishes
conspiracies
to
overthrow
the
government.
this
statute
punishes
conspiracies
to
advocate
overthrow
or
the
advocacy
itself
and
it
is
my
position
that
under
the
first
amendment,
congress
cannot
proscribe
mere
membership
in
an
organization
that
does
nothing
but
advocate
even
if
the
advocacy
is
force
and
violence.
mr.
telford
taylor
advocates
the
accomplishment
of
purpose.
mr.
telford
taylor
indeed
so.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
had
enough
difficulties
sustaining
the
actual
members
of
--
the
actual
conspiracy
charged
in
the
dennis
case.
by
difficulty,
i
mean
soul
searching,
consideration
and
disagreement,
and
if
that
case
is
an
arguably
closed
one,
as
it
seems
to
me
is
a
very
serious
problem,
this
case
seems
to
me
a
fortiori,
this
is
so
much
further
removed
from
any
concept
of
clear
and
present
danger.
here,
we
have
nothing
but
an
allegation
of
membership
instead
of
an
allegation
of
co-conspiracy
with
the
leaders
of
the
party
that
were
involved
in
dennis.
now,
as
i
was
saying
to
meet
--
mr.
telford
taylor
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes.
mr.
telford
taylor
those
who
organize
it,
those
who
advocate
or
who
conspired
to
do
it
and
that
of
course
is
quite
an
important
factor
because
in
my
belief,
the
court
laid
great
stress
on
the
presence
of
conspiracy
in
its
--
in
its
opinion
in
the
dennis
case.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes.
mr.
telford
taylor
i
should
think
not.
it
is
true
that
there
is
no
--
mr.
telford
taylor
it
is
true
that
there
is
no
speech
of
the
member
involved
if
he
is
as
you
say
a
silent
member.
but
the
only
thing
which
is
dangerous
about
the
group
is
that
it
is
an
advocating
to
a
speaking
group
so
that
speech
must
come
into
it
in
terms
of
the
group
even
though
it
doesn't
in
terms
of
the
individual
member.
so
that
all
the
problems
under
the
first
amendment
that
confronted
the
court
in
dennis
are
here
multiplied
and
aggravated
by
the
fact
that
the
petitioner's
connection
with
the
conspiracy
or
the
advocacy
is
so
much
more
remote
than
it
was
in
the
case
that
came
here
before
it.
mr.
telford
taylor
because,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
prohibition
is
on
membership
in
a
group
that
advocates,
in
a
group
that
advocates.
and
therefore,
the
thing
which
is
being
based
upon,
i
suppose,
is
the
petitioner's
freedom
to
belong
to
a
group
dedicated
to
the
purpose
of
advocacy.
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
i
should
think
--
mr.
telford
taylor
i
should
think
that
speech
is
not
only
what
you
or
i
may
say
with
our
own
lips,
but
it
is
also
expression
through
organizations
whom
they
belong
to.
and
i
should
certainly
think
that
penal
restrictions
on
membership
in
a
group
based
on
advocacy
by
that
very
fact
must
impinge
on
free
speech.
might
i
continue
to
meet
what
are
the
arguments
that
had
been
levelled
against
my
position
by
the
solicitor
general.
because
he
undertakes
to
meet
our
position
on
constitutionality,
as
i
said,
by
reading
a
great
many
additional
factors
into
this
membership
clause
so
that
by
the
time
it
gets
through,
it
is
substantially
the
same
as
if
this
were
a
conspiracy
case.
i
have
mentioned
that
he
wishes
to
read
into
it
the
additional
requirement
of
personal
intent.
he
also
wishes
to
limit
it
to
active
members.
now,
as
to
those
two
things,
i
am
about
to
state
briefly
the
reasons
why
i
think
that
can't
be
done,
but
i
should
like
to
state
at
the
outset
that
it
is
not
crucial
to
my
position
whether
or
not
we
read
personal
intent
into
this
clause.
it
is
not
crucial
to
my
position
that
we
read
an
implied
limitation
to
active
members.
what
he
does
attempt
to
read
and
that
i
do
think
is
crucial
is
the
equivalent
of
a
conspiracy
case,
but
let
me
deal
first
with
the
personal
intent
problem.
the
solicitor
general's
position
is
that
mens
rea
or
guilty
intent
is
often
read
into
criminal
statutes
and
that
it
should
be
done
in
this
case
in
order
to
assist
the
constitutionality
as
an
aid
to
interpreting
the
clause
of
being
constitutional.
and
he
points
to
the
dennis
case,
where
this
court
did
read
the
requirement
of
personal
intent
into
the
paragraphs
dealing
with
advocacy
and
organizing.
now,
in
fact,
i
think
it
is
very
difficult
to
read
a
personal
intent
in
here
and
i
will
state
briefly
why.
this
membership
clause
is
part
of
the
smith
act
which
in
turn
is
modeled
on
a
new
york
statute,
which
came
before
this
court
in
the
gitlow
case.
the
resemblance
between
the
smith
act
and
the
new
york
statute
was
commented
on
in
the
dennis
case
itself.
the
new
york
statute
contains
a
membership
clause.
it
was
not
involved
in
the
gitlow
case,
but
it's
been
on
the
books
there
all
the
time.
and
the
membership
clause
in
the
new
york
statute
does
not
even
require
knowledge.
it
is
a
naked
prohibition
of
membership
with
no
additional
qualifications
or
limitations,
and
it
was
in
that
form
that
the
smith
act
was
first
introduced
in
congress.
the
membership
clause
in
the
original
smith
act
simply
prohibited
membership
and
did
not
require
any
joint
personal
knowledge.
that
requirement,
that
personal
knowledge,
was
added
in
the
assigned
judiciary
committee
by
a
specific
amendment.
that
being
so,
and
congress
having
deliberately
added
the
requirement
of
knowledge,
it
would
seem
quite
arguable
that
had
they
meant
to
include
intent
at
the
time
they
were
fortifying
this
clause,
they
would
have
specifically
added
intent,
and
intent
is
indeed
to
be
found
in
paragraph
2
of
the
smith
act,
the
clause
dealing
with
literature.
well,
but
what
about
the
reasoning
of
this
court
in
the
dennis
case,
when
it
was
read
into
advocacy
and
organizing?
i
don't
think
it
applies
here.
this
court
went
on
the
basis
that
it
is
part
of
the
intrinsic
nature
of
things
that
if
you
advocate
a
result,
you
intend
it,
or
that
if
you
organize
a
group
to
advocate
a
result
that
you
intended.
but
it
does
not
follow,
certainly
does
not
follow
nearly
as
automatically,
that
because
you
are
a
member
of
a
group,
you
intend
all
of
its
purposes,
legal
or
illegal.
the
--
the
addition
does
not
follow
by
the
same
logic
as
in
the
other
clauses
and
here,
we
have
a
legislative
history
showing
that
the
original
models
of
the
statute
didn't
even
require
knowledge
and
that
congress
specifically
added
knowledge.
now,
those
considerations
apply
in
general
also
to
the
proposal
from
the
solicitor
general
that
the
requirement
of
party
activity
to
be
read
in
here.
but
now,
we
come
to
the
addition
which
i
think
is
really
the
crucial
point,
because
in
addition
to
intent
and
activity,
the
solicitor
general
wishes
to
read
into
this
clause
the
sort
of
thing
that
is
found
at
page
45
of
his
brief.
he
quotes
justice
jackson's
opinion
in
the
doud's
case
and
then
once
--
goes
on
to
say
that
ordinary
conspiracy
principles
are
playing
irrelevant
to
membership
in
an
organization
where
a
membership
entails
such
tightly
disciplined
quasi-military,
deeply
conspiratorial
activities
as
those
of
the
organization
against
which
the
smith
act
is
directed.
such
membership
obviously
partakes
of
the
concert
of
action,
combination
and
acting
together
which
characterize
conspiracy.
that
indeed
was
also
more
or
less
the
theory
upon
which
the
court
of
appeals
went
below.
they
--
the
court
in
substance
equated
membership
in
an
organization
with
being
a
conspirator.
now,
i
do
not
think
that
this
effort
to
save
the
constitutionality
of
the
membership
clause
by
reading
all
this
material
into
it,
can
work.
i
have
four
reasons
why
i
think
this
--
this
effort
must
fail.
the
first
one
is
a
purely
verbal
one,
but
i
think
it
is
nonetheless
important.
it
is
all
very
well
to
try
to
save
a
statute
by
construing
it
so
as
to
be
constitutional.
it
is
entirely
proper
to
work
the
construction
in
such
a
direction
that
constitutional
questions
aren't
raised.
but
it
--
one
cannot
simply
and
totally
rewrite
the
statute
for
that
purpose.
more
for
amusement
than
anything
else,
i
have
written
out
here
how
the
statute
would
look
if
everything
the
solicitor
general
wants
to
add
into
it
were
added
into
it.
and
if
there
is
very
little
resemblance
to
the
original
clause,
that
argument
may
be
said
to
be
formal,
but
there
comes
a
point
where
formalities
have
some
meaning
and
this
is
simply
trying
to
add
too
much
by
way
of
implication.
but
there
are
more
important
reasons.
if
we
adopt
the
interpretation
below
and
the
solicitor
general's
interpretation,
and
in
substance,
turn
this
membership
clause
into
a
conspiracy
clause.
we
have
rendered
either
that
clause
itself
or
the
conspiracy
provision
meaningless
surplusage
and
i
would
like
to
remind
the
court
that
in
1940,
when
this
clause
was
--
when
this
act
was
passed,
in
fact,
from
1940
to
1948,
there
was
a
separate
conspiracy
provision
right
in
the
smith
act.
one
was
not
at
that
time
indicted
under
the
general
conspiracy
statute,
but
under
the
conspiracy
clause
of
the
smith
act
itself
and
that
has
now
been
restored
with
the
smith
act
by
an
amendment
in
1956.
so
that
it
seems
to
me
incredible
that
congress
would
have
inserted
the
membership
clause,
merely
to
serve
as
sort
of
another
version
of
a
conspiracy
charge.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes.
mr.
telford
taylor
several.
mr.
telford
taylor
indeed,
the
trial
court
did
not
read
into
it
what
the
solicitor
general
seeks
to
do
and
that
was
the
fourth
of
the
arguments
that
i
intended
to
--
to
point
here.
mr.
telford
taylor
that's
quite
right.
in
other
words,
even
if
you
try
to
build
up
by
holding
new
membership
clause
here,
you
still
got
to
go
back
to
two
things,
the
indictment
and
the
charge.
none
of
these
things
that
the
solicitor
general
wants
to
add
were
in
the
indictment.
he
was
not
indicted
for
being
an
active
member.
he
was
indicted
for
having
an
intent.
that's
the
one
thing
i
did
add
in
that
isn't
in
the
statute.
but
these
other
things
importing
a
whole
thought
of
conspiracy,
concert
of
action
and
error
were
not
put
in
the
indictment
and
the
jury
was
never
charged
that
any
such
elements
as
that
have
any
bearing
on
guilt
or
innocence.
mr.
telford
taylor
it
seems
to
me
so.
there
is
one
other
factor
that
i
think
also
is
of
importance
and
that
is
that
the
position
that
the
government
wishes
to
take
would
give
the
government
all
the
benefits
of
the
conspiracy
idea
but
none
of
the
burdens.
if
you
are
going
to
charge
a
person
with
conspiracy,
you
have
to
indict
more
than
one
person.
you
have
to
name
co-conspirators.
you
have
to
name
at
least
those
co-conspirators
upon
whose
evidence
you're
going
to
rely
to
convict
anyone.
you
have
to
prove
an
agreement.
that's
the
--
the
essential
thing
about
a
conspiracy,
is
that
it
is
an
agreement
to
achieve
some
unlawful
objective
or
by
some
unlawful
means.
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
this
is
scales,
not
likely.
mr.
telford
taylor
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
basis
of
their
argument
and
--
and
it
isn't
only
that.
it
is
also
in
my
opinion
of
theory
that
judge
parker
went
on
below
in
sustaining
this
act.
we
have
quoted
in
our
brief
segments
from
judge
parker's
opinion
and
he
does
say
it,
a
tantamount
of
conspiracy
case
and
treats
it
just
as
if
it
were
a
conspiracy
case.
but
if
it
were,
why
then
all
these
things
that
i
have
been
mentioning
would
have
to
be
there,
there
would
have
to
be
co-conspirators.
there
would
have
to
be
a
charge
and
proof
of
an
agreement.
there
would
have
to
a
charge
of
some
joint
action
of
some
kind.
but
nothing
like
that
has
been
charged
here,
nothing
like
that
is
in
statute
and
it
seems
to
me
therefore
that
the
--
that
the
act
must
fail.
now,
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
proceed
immediately
to
the
statutory
problem
because
as
i
have
indicated,
i
think
that
that
maybe
of
equal
importance
here
and
maybe
considered
first.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes.
mr.
telford
taylor
that
is
the
way
i
read
the
brief.
their
argument
in
favor
of
the
statute's
constitutionality
is
certainly
bottomed
on
the
assumption
that
these
elements
of
working
together,
concert
of
action
are
considered
as
being
part
of
the
membership
clause.
mr.
telford
taylor
i
think
they
would
argue
that
--
that
in
their
view,
the
communist
party
is
the
kind
of
organization
that
has
these
characteristics.
but
that
gets
us,
mr.
justice
douglas,
to
a
matter
of
proof,
not
to
a
matter
of
what
a
statute
prohibits
when
an
indictment
accuse
this
person
of
and
what
a
judge
charges
the
issues
on
that.
and
those
--
that's
the
framework
that
we
have
to
stay
within
here
or
if
one
comes
to
the
proof.
the
government
who
undoubtedly
cite
many
things
that
they
say
shows
that
the
party
was
like
this.
but
if
we
look
at
the
statute,
the
indictment
and
the
charge,
we
don't
encounter
those
problems
and
we
shouldn't.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes.
mr.
telford
taylor
quite
right,
yes.
mr.
telford
taylor
that's
the
difference.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes.
mr.
telford
taylor
that's
my
position.
and
if
you're
going
to
say
it,
then
you've
got
an
indictment
for
conspiracy.
mr.
telford
taylor
quite
right.
let
me
turn
now
to
the
statutory
question
and
i
will
remind
the
court
that
4
(f)
of
the
internal
security
act,
which
is
what
i
rely
on
here,
says
that
neither
the
holding
of
office
nor
membership
in
any
communist
organization
by
any
person
shall
constitute
per
se
a
violation
of
this
act
or
of
any
other
criminal
statutes.
now,
the
issue
this
time
between
myself
and
the
solicitor
general
is
as
follows.
he
says
that
because
the
words
"per
se"
are
in
there,
that
this
clause
from
the
internal
security
act
only
bars
the
prosecution
on
the
ground
of
membership
and
nothing
else.
whereas,
the
smith
act
membership
clause
prohibits
membership
plus
knowledge
and
therefore,
membership
plus
knowledge
is
something
more
than
membership
or
officership
per
se.
and
you
can
be
indicted
under
the
smith
act
for
membership
plus
knowledge.
that
is
his
argument.
now,
i
will
meet
that
in
two
ways.
i
should
like
to
say
first
what
i
think
it
does
mean.
i
think
this
clause
means
that
a
communist
can
be
prosecuted
for
advocating
the
overthrow
of
government
for
distributing
a
literature
or
organizing
a
group
that
advocates
or
for
conspiring
to
do
those
things.
in
other
words,
he
can
be
indicted
and
tried
under
the
smith
act
in
terms
of
prohibited
action.
but
that
he
can't
be
indicted
and
tried
in
terms
of
membership.
that's
what
i
read
the
clause
to
mean.
if
we
differentiate
on
the
ground
of
membership
plus
knowledge,
then
we
encounter
problems,
both
of
legislative
history
and
of
logic.
and
let
me
do
the
legislative
history
first.
the
purpose
of
this
provision
in
the
internal
security
act
is
perfectly
clear.
the
internal
security
act
makes
certain
findings
about
the
communist
party.
it
prohibits
certain
conduct
and
it
requires
members
of
communist
organizations
to
--
to
register.
well,
the
introduction
of
a
registration
statute,
that
is
to
say
an
exposure
statute,
so
to
speak,
into
a
field
already
covered
by
penal
legislation
raised
obvious
problems
under
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
self-incrimination
provision
there,
problems
which
this
court
brushed
in
the
--
in
the
subversive
control
board
case
which
was
sent
back
for
reasons
parallel
to
those
discussed
this
morning.
now,
john
w.
davis,
late
john
w.
davis
pointed
out
to
the
senate
committee
that
this
problem
of
self-incrimination
was
inherent
in
the
registration
notion.
he
pointed
out
in
the
internal
security
act
in
one
breath
undertakes
to
punish
people
who
try
to
overthrow
the
government.
the
exact
language
of
the
penal
provision
is
found
in
my
brief
at
page
48."
it
would
be
unlawful
for
any
person
to
conspire,
to
perform
any
act
which
would
substantially
contribute
to
the
establishment
within
the
united
states
of
a
totalitarian
dictatorship.”
i
believe
no
one
has
been,
as
far
as
i
know,
indicted
under
that
yet.
but
obviously,
there
would
be
danger
that
if
one
registers
a
communist
under
section
7
of
the
act,
one
might
inculpate
oneself
under
this
that
i
just
read.
and
john
w.
davis
pointed
that
out
and
it
was
on
his
urging
that
section
4
(f)
came
into
existence.
but
in
the
form
that
it
first
came
into
existence,
all
he
did
was
say
that
you
couldn't
be
prosecuted
under
this
other
section
of
the
internal
security
act
by
virtue
of
communist
membership.
then,
when
it
reached
congress,
senator
kilgore
and
the
senate,
congressman
cellar
in
the
house
both
pointed
out
that
section
4
(f)
in
that
form
did
not
give
any
protection
under
the
smith
act.
and
indeed,
senator
kilgore
specifically
referred
to
the
membership
clause
of
the
smith
act,
saying
that
if
you
could
be
required
to
register
as
a
communist
and
then
prosecuted
for
membership
under
the
membership
clause,
it
would
clearly
have
a
fifth
amendment
objection
to
registration.
and
that
unless
you
put
in
this
provision,
therefore,
the
registration
mechanism
would
breakdown
because
the
privilege
would
be
available.
so,
this
4
(f)
and
the
reference
to
any
other
criminal
statute
which
is
thereupon
added
to
it
was
put
in
there
specifically
with
the
membership
clause
in
mind.
now,
the
solicitor
general
says
that
the
purpose
of
4
(f)
is
to
ensure
that
the
membership
clause
will
not
be
construed
as
punishing
membership
without
knowledge.
well,
i've
heard
the
story
about
hiring
an
elephant
to
step
on
a
mat,
but
this
is
getting
an
elephant
to
step
on
a
mat
that
isn't
there
because
this
membership
clause
already
sets
its
membership
with
knowledge
which
is
punishable.
and
to
think
that
congress
would
have
enacted
an
entire
clause
10
years
later
to
ensure
that
that
would
be
not
construed
as
membership
without
knowledge
seems
to
me
with
quite
--
quite
impossible
reasoning,
quite
impossible.
it
isn't
as
if
there
was
any
ambiguity
in
the
membership
clause
by
requiring
knowledge.
it's
there
in
so
many
words.
there
is
certainly
no
need
to
enact
another
statute
to
ensure
that
knowledge
would
be
left
in
there.
the
result
is
that
under
the
interpretation
he
contends
for,
section
4
(f)
is
left
without
any
place
to
operate,
because
even
those
other
sections
of
the
internal
security
act
require
knowledge.
so
that
if
4
(f)
only
protects
communists
who
do
not
know
the
purpose
of
the
party,
it
would
have
absolutely
no
effect
under
either
of
the
membership
clause
or
the
other
sections
of
the
internal
security
act.
and
what
would
it
do
to
the
internal
security
act
itself?this
after
all
is
a
scheme
of
trying
to
get
people
to
register,
enforce
--
enforcement
of
communist
registration.
but
if
4
(f)
only
protects
communists
who
do
not
know
the
unlawful
purpose
of
the
party,
presumably,
such
ignorant
communists
are
the
only
ones
who
can
be
required
to
register,
and
any
communist
who
has
guilty
knowledge,
guilty
intent
of
any
kind
can
plead
self-incrimination
and
avoid
registration.
it's
quite
beyond
the
purview
of
possibility
that
congress
intended
any
such
consequence
as
that.
what
they
were
trying
to
do
is
to
ensure
that
communist
could
be
required
to
register
under
the
internal
security
act
and
to
give
them
the
protection
that
they
needed
to
avoid
the
plea
of
self-incrimination.
now,
it
may
or
may
not
be
that
congress
was
successful.
it
may
or
may
not
be
that
this
provision
is
broad
enough
to
give
them
that
protection.
mr.
telford
taylor
but
their
purpose
--
mr.
telford
taylor
that
may
well
be,
justice
harlan,
but
that
that
was
their
purpose,
there
is
no
doubt.
john
w.
davis'
letter,
the
debates,
the
addition
of
a
phrase
or
of
any
other
criminal
statute
make
it
quite
clear
that
the
purpose
of
this
--
and
there
could
have
been
no
other.
i
mean,
congress
had
no
reason
to
pass
this
provision,
saying
that
communists
shall
not
be
prosecuted
for
that
reason
alone.
he
had
no
reason
to
pass
that
other
than
to
try
to
meet
the
self-incrimination
danger
to
the
registration
provisions.
now,
may
well
be
as
i
say
that
they
do
not
go
far
enough,
but
the
effect
of
4
(f),
the
interpretation
of
4
(f)
must
be
in
the
light
of
what
congress
is
trying
to
do.
and
assuming
that
--
that
this
is
what
it
was
trying
to
do
which
i
think
is
beyond
argument,
it
cannot
be
confined
the
way
this
was
the
general
wish
it
to
be.
mr.
telford
taylor
it
does
in
section
2.
that
of
course
merely
reinforced
the
danger
of
self-incrimination.
mr.
telford
taylor
it
is
quite
clear
to
me
that
it
was
the
danger
of
--
of
that
that
led
to
the
inclusion
of
4
(f).
it
was
the
combination
of
the
congressional
finding
in
section
2,
the
penal
provisions
in
section
(4),
and
the
registration
provisions
in
section
7
that
originally
led
mr.
davis
to
write
this
letter.
they
wrote
an
exculpating
provision
which
applied
only
to
the
penal
provision
in
section
(4),
then
it
being
pointed
out
that
the
membership
clause
was
still
on
the
books.
they
added
the
provision
of
any
other
criminal
statute.
now,
it
is
not
arguable,
i
think,
justice
harlan
that
what
they
were
worried
about
was
that
the
membership
clause
would
be
construed
as
punishing
membership
alone,
because
it
says
right
in
it,
membership,
knowing
the
purposes
thereof,
that
language
could
be
no
clearer.
mr.
telford
taylor
they
were
still
vulnerable
to
prosecution
in
the
way
they're
being
prosecuted
in
these
other
cases
under
the
substantive
provisions
or
action
of
some
kind
--
mr.
telford
taylor
but
not
on
the
membership
clause.
they
will
be
vulnerable
for
prosecution
for
advocacy,
organizing,
conspiring
to
do
those
things
without
their
membership.
mr.
telford
taylor
they
would
be
required
to
register
and
whether
or
not
this
4
(f)
is
sufficient
to
wipe
out
their
plea
of
self-incrimination
is
a
question
that
is
not
now
before
us,
though
it
may
well
be
in
another
case
one
day.
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
the
indictment
is
under
the
membership
clause
but
4
(f),
your
honor,
says
that
no
communist
shall
be
prosecuted
--
it
says
neither
the
holding
of
office
nor
membership
shall
constitute
per
se
a
violation
of
this
section
or
of
any
other
criminal
statute
and
the
--
or
of
any
other
criminal
statute
covers
the
membership
clause,
the
smith
act
and
was
put
in
by
specific
design
to
reach
the
membership
clause
of
the
smith
act
which
is
the
section
that
--
mr.
telford
taylor
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
we
do
know
that
the
--
if
--
that
the
any
other
criminal
statute
was
put
in
there
because
it
was
brought
home
to
congress
that
communists
could
be
prosecuted
under
the
membership
clause
and
that
there
was
a
danger
that
if
they
remained
vulnerable
to
that
they
would
have
the
plea
self-incrimination
when
required
to
register.
that
is
the
--
mr.
telford
taylor
--
point
of
senator
kilgore's
report
--
pardon
me.
mr.
telford
taylor
the
legislative
history
is
discussed
in
there
at
--
just
a
minute.
mr.
telford
taylor
pages
29
to
31,
and
you
will
find
the
reference
to
senator
kilgore
at
page
31.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes.
the
senate
bill
in
the
meantime
was
reported
out
with
the
provision
that
neither
membership
nor
office
holding
of
any
communist
organization
should
constitute
a
violation
of
the
internal
security
act,
what
mr.
justice
harlan
was
asking
about.
in
a
minority
report,
senator
kilgore
pointed
out
that
this
provision
does
not
even
purport
to
avoid
self-incrimination
in
relation
to
the
membership
clause
of
the
smith
act.
and
then
the
other
senators
joined
in
and
there
was
this
amendment
written
in
any
of
the
criminal
statute.
mr.
telford
taylor
pardon
me?
mr.
telford
taylor
the
amendment
was
written
in
after
senator
kilgore
made
his
minority
report.
it
was
written
in
--
actually
in
contrast.
what
had
happened
was
that
a
different
kind
of
clause
of
4
(f)
had
emerged
from
the
house
and
a
different
kind
from
the
senate,
and
the
two
were
sort
of
melted
together
in
conference.
in
the
course
of
which
per
se
was
put
in
and
the
words
or
of
any
other
criminal
statute
were
added.
mr.
telford
taylor
that
i
do
not
know.
he
was
the
author
of
the
minority
report
from
the
senate
committee,
so
--
mr.
telford
taylor
that's
correct.
so,
it's
quite
possible
that
he
was
in
the
conference,
but
i
have
to
check
that.
mr.
telford
taylor
well
--
mr.
telford
taylor
1950?
he's
the
chairman
or
a
ranking
minority
member.
again,
i'll
have
to
check.
mr.
telford
taylor
it
had
been
codefied
i
believe
in
1948
--
mr.
telford
taylor
--
before
this
indictment.
mr.
telford
taylor
in
the
u.s.
code.
mr.
telford
taylor
no,
in
1952
--
mr.
telford
taylor
excuse
me,
there
is
another
amendment
in
1956,
just
this
year.
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
they
are
all
assembled
together
in
--
in
one
volume
of
the
code,
yes.
i've
forgotten
the
exact
sequence.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes,
that
would
be
true.
that
would
be
true.
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
if
there's
--
mr.
telford
taylor
part
of
a
scheme
of
statutes
regulating
the
question
of
security,
1940,
1950,
communist
control
act
of
1954,
etcetera,
etcetera.
now,
i
think
that
i
have
covered
the
principal
things
that
i
wanted
to
say
about
these
two
major
points
and
i
do
want
to
reserve
some
time
for
a
reply.
as
to
the
evidence
here,
i
would
simply
like
to
make
one
observation.
the
evidence
given
about
the
communist
party
here
is
subject
to
exact
to
the
same
infirmities
that
were
the
basis
of
judge
hastie's
dissent
on
the
mesarosh
case.
i
had
of
course
expected
before
that
the
mesarosh
case
would
have
been
discussed
this
morning
so
that
i
could
shortcut
it.
but
essentially,
judge
hastie
thought
that
there
was
not
sufficient
testimony
of
imminent
overthrow
of
the
government
toward
defining
a
clear
and
present
danger.
insofar
as
scales
himself
is
concerned,
there
is
a
place
in
the
record
where
one
of
the
government
witnesses,
i
believe
it
is
childs
who
testifies
that
he
asked
scales
how
soon
he
thought
this
violent
revolution
is
going
to
occur.
and
his
answer
was
that,
“your
daughter
who
is
now
one-year-old
will
be
married
under
a
socialist
government.”
allowing
the
usual
span,
it
would
seem
that
the
revolution
was
in
the
neighborhood
of
20
or
21
years
off.
this
is
not
quite
as
long
as
william
z.
foster
made
it
when
he
dedicated
the
book
to
his
great,
great
grandson
who
would
grow
up
under
a
communist
government.
but
questions
were
asked
in
the
last
two
days
about
how
soon
this
revolution
has
to
come.
and
in
terms
of
scales'
personal
intent,
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
the
government
is
relying
on
evidence
about
a
theoretical
attitude
of
approval
of
the
idea
of
revolution.
that
in
terms
of
imminence
or
incitement,
he
is
talking
about
spans
of
20
years
and
this
is
a
very
difficult
thing
to
make
into
a
clear
and
present
danger.
i
will
rely
on
my
brief
where
the
points
brought
fair
trial,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
rest.
mr.
telford
taylor
mr.
chief
justice,
the
marshal
tells
me
i
have
three
minutes
left.
i
believe
the
argument
on
the
statutory
point
on
4
(f)
has
been
fairly
joined
and
pretty
fully
explored.
and
i
would
like
to
spend
my
three
minutes
--
mr.
telford
taylor
section
17?
mr.
telford
taylor
oh,
well,
my
--
my
statement
on
that
is
--
is
in
my
brief
and
it's
--
it's
my
feeling
that
that
is
a
general
provision
which
is
frequently
in
long
and
complicated
statutes
and
which
must
necessarily
give
way
to
a
special
provision
inserted,
obviously,
for
a
special
purpose.
mr.
telford
taylor
there
is.
mr.
telford
taylor
i
would
like
to
make
two
observations
on
the
constitutional
point
arising
out
of
the
colloquy
between
the
bench
and
the
solicitor
general.
yesterday,
justice
harlan
asked
about
the
instructions
given
to
the
jury
with
respect
to
these
added
ingredients
which
may
or
may
not
be
read
into
the
statute.
i
might
say
that
the
charge
itself
is
to
be
found
in
the
record
here,
page
107
to
16,
but
i
think
the
answer
to
justice
harlan's
question
is
as
follows.
that
on
the
element
of
intent,
which
the
solicitor
general
wishes
to
read
them,
instructions
were
very
clearly
given
that
the
jury
must
find
intent.
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
but
it
is
equally
beyond
doubt
that
no
instructions
were
given
on
the
added
notion
of
the
acts
of
membership
much
less
where
any
instructions
given
on
the
idea
that
the
party
must
be
a
sort
of
quasi-conspiratorial
body
which
is
so
much
the
basis
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision
below.
now,
justice
minton
asked
the
question
along
the
same
line,
which
was
whether
for
a
conviction
here,
there
wouldn't
have
to
be
some
kind
of
advocacy.
well,
it
is
quite
clear,
i
believe,
justice
minton,
that
--
that
there
is
no
such
requirement
of
statutes.
there
is
no
such
charge
in
the
indictment.
and
there
is
no
such
instruction
to
the
jury,
that
is
the
--
the
conviction
here
must
stand
on
the
basis
where
the
element
of
personal
advocacy
is
entirely
absent
and
it
must
stand
or
fall
on
that
ground.
now,
my
other
observation
relates
to
the
colloquy
between
the
solicitor
general
and
justice
frankfurter,
in
which
justice
frankfurter
mentioned
bryant
against
zimmerman,
a
case
involving
the
ku
klux
klan,
and
i
thought
with
the
suggestion
perhaps
that
case
was
governing
or
relevant
to
the
constitutional
problem
here.
i
do
not,
with
all
respect,
believe
it
is.
i
have
refreshed
my
recollection
about
the
case
this
morning.
there
is
no
problem
of
advocacy
involved
there
and
indeed,
it
was
not
a
prohibitory
statute.
that
was
a
new
york
statute
which
related
to
societies
bound
by
oaths.
it
is
a
lineal
descendant
of
old
british
statutes
directed
to
the
same
end,
which
are
referred
to
in
my
brief.
and
there
has
always
been
a
policy
against
those
because
such
societies
tend
to
punish
their
own
members
and
oust
the
court's
jurisdiction
varies
to
the
factors
like
that.
it
was
for
that
reason
that
they
require
registration
like
the
internal
security
act.
it
was
not
a
prohibitory
statute.
in
whitney
against
california,
i
think
quite
clearly,
the
concurring
justices
regarded
the
statute
such
as
this
one
as
raising
an
acute
problem
of
both
assembly
and
free
speech.
thank
you.
