justice
john
m.
harlan
are
there
any
questions
as
to
the
judge's
charge?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
one
question
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
before
you
go
to
that?
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
government
as
you
interpret
their
position
except
for
this
element
of
specific
intent
that
they
recognize
has
to
be
imported
or
which
they
agree
has
to
be
imported
into
the
statute.
but
apart
from
that,
they
don't
undertake
to
defend
the
statute
with
that
addition
except
with
the
addition
of
these
other
elements
that
you
talk
about?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
was
going
to
say
under
series
of
things,
would
that
be
the
purpose
they
did
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
their
own
statement
they
left
(inaudible)
to
the
prosecution
for
all
other
violations.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
security
act
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
it
be
that
the
purpose
of
section
4
(f)
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
not
saying
that
the
(inaudible)
bear
in
mind
there
were
citings
(inaudible)
in
terms
of
the
security
act,
if
you
read
section
4
(f)
as
--
as
you've
placed
here
that
despite
those
incitements,
there
was
to
be
no
prosecution
under
the
internal
security
act
against
members
--
members
of
the
communist
party.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
doesn't
reach
however
the
membership
clause
of
smith
act
and
that
if
you
could
carry
that,
at
least
that
point
in
your
argument,
then
many
other
criminal
statute
simply
to
revert
the
prosecution
of
the
communist,
being
a
member
is
one,
of
the
party
first
if
any
other
criminal
statute
makes
that
an
offense
leading
the
membership
clause
holding
the
defense.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
smith
act
did
not
in
terms
referred
as
a
communist
party.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
membership
clause
did
not
in
terms.
is
it
your
point
that
absent
the
4
(f)
provision,
it
might
have
been
that
particularly
in
view
of
the
recitals
in
the
internal
security
act
granting
the
party
as
a
subversive
party,
that
somebody
might
have
thought
that
by
putting
in
mere
membership
of
the
communist
party
would
make
a
prima
facie
case
under
the
membership
clause
which
required
knowledge,
is
that
your
point?
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
rankin,
assuming
knowledge
and
intent
to
be
proved,
you've
drawn
a
distinction
between
the
validity
of
the
statute
as
applied
to
a
passive
member
as
distinguished
on
an
officer
or
an
active
member.
what
i
mean
is,
supposing
a
man
gets
a
letter
to
make
it
concrete,
gets
a
letter
saying
this
party
dedicated
to
violence
and
overthrow
would
like
to
have
your
support
and
believe
in
it,
he
signs
up,
does
nothing
more,
he
goes
to
no
meetings,
is
he
reached
by
the
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
prove
knowledge
and
intent.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
he
writes
a
letter
back
says,
"i
agree
with
all
this.
this
is
my
program.
i'd
like
to
lend
my
support.
here
is
my
subscription.‚Äù
he
signs
up,
there's
nothing
more.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
another
question.
the
reason
i
asked
you
was
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
because
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
implicit
in
your
brief
--
and
mr.
taylor
made
some
point
of
it
that
you
did
add
to
the
element
of
the
membership
something
that
connoted
"active
membership"
as
distinguished
in
passive
membership.
that's
the
reason
i
put
the
question
to
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
would
be
the
ordinary
way
of
proving
intent.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
i'm
trying
to
test
my
understanding
of
your
theory
conceptually
where
you
had
all
of
that
supplied
by
written
evidence
and
was
foolish
enough
to
say
"yes,
i
believe
all
these
and
i'll
join
your
party
and
then
does
nothing
more."
i
understood
from
your
brief
you
expressed
some
doubt
as
to
whether
you
could
get
that
man
or
constitutionally
apply
the
statute
to
that
type
of
person
as
against
a
--
an
active
man.
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
you
do
write
something
more
to
the
statute
then?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you're
talking
about
evidence,
i'm
talking
about
constitutionality.
justice
john
m.
harlan
my
question,
assume
a
card
carrying
communist,
a
card
carrying
member,
so
that
he's
a
member
in
every
sense
of
the
term,
but
he's
not
an
active
one.
he
doesn't
go
around
and
preach.
he
pays
his
dues.
he's
carried
on
the
roles.
he
carries
the
card.
and
i
understood
you
say
that
you
would
not
regard
that
kind
of
a
member
as
being
subject
to
the
membership
clause.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
let
me
make
my
question
then
more
specific.
supposing
a
man
has
all
of
those
attitudes
of
mind
that
are
in
that
bylaw
and
he's
admitted
to
membership
on
those
premises
and
he
gets
a
card
and
then
either
through
inefficiency
or
through
waiver
of
those
requirements
or
because
they
like
him,
they
tolerate
him
as
a
member
in
the
party,
don't
revoke
his
membership,
don't
revoke
his
card
even
though
he
doesn't
become
active
in
all
those
senses
that
you're
talking
about
there,
so
that
he
remains
a
member,
is
he
subject
to
the
membership
clause?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
if
he
--
if
he
had
intent,
then
would
he
necessarily
be
or
would
he,
in
your
view,
be
necessarily
be
covered
by
the
membership
clause?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
bearing
in
mind
that
this
statute
is
not
in
terms
leveled
against
the
communist
party
but
is
in
the
level
in
terms
against
subversive
organizations,
i
mean,
organizations
believing
in
enforcing
violence,
there
might
well
be
organizations
that
don't
have
these
requirements
of
these
bylaws
that
don't
insist
on
active
membership.
yet,
i
take
it
you
would
say
that
as
a
matter
of
construction,
the
statute
is
limited
to
active
membership
even
though
the
bylaws
of
another
type
of
organization
didn't
have
these
provisions
that
the
communist
party
mentioned.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
you
read
into
the
statute
active
membership
in
effect.
