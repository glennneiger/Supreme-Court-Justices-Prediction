mr.
j.
lee
rankin
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
i'd
like
to
call
attention
to
one
fact
in
regard
to
the
statute
of
limitations,
which
was
increased
to
five
years
in
the
summer
of
1954,
which
was
before
the
indictment
in
this
case,
which
was
in
november
of
1954.
so,
the
critical
period
would
reach
five
years
back
in
november
of
1954,
instead
of
the
lesser
period.
while
the
matter
is
fresh
in
your
minds,
i'd
like
to
briefly
refer
to
section
4
(f)
on
our
interpretation
of
what
the
congress
did
and
try
to
do.
we
have
no
dispute
about
the
legislative
history
as
set
out
in
the
briefs.
we
agree
that
the
various
congressmen
and
senators
said
substantially
what
was
set
forth
in
the
briefs
in
regard
to
that.
but
the
problem
of
accepting
the
interpretation
replaced
by
the
petitioner
upon
this
section
of
the
statute
from
the
internal
security
act
of
1950,
seems
to
us
impossible.
because
at
the
very
time
that
the
congress
was
doing
this,
it
was
residing
at
considerable
length
and
petitioner
claim
--
complaints
about
it,
that
this
communist
party
was
a
terrible
instrument
engaged
in
a
program
for
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states.
and
then,
by
this
device
of
4
(f),
the
congress
at
the
same
time
was
supposed
to
set
up
a
provision
which
would
emasculate
a
portion
of
the
smith
act
under
which
they
just
debated
and
knew
that
prosecutions
had
been
sustained
by
the
courts
in
the
dennis
case.
and
they
were
to
take
out
this
membership
clause
entirely
at
the
same
time
that
they
were
going
at
lengths
to
condemn
this
party
and
its
action
to
require
registration.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
that
is
the
claim.
i
want
to
deal
with
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
the
congress
was
careful
about
the
use
of
the
expression
"per
se,"
and
the
problem
was
whether
or
not
membership
by
itself
was
a
vice
for
which
a
person
could
be
convicted
of
a
crime.
and
they
were
trying
to
deal
expressly
with
that
problem
and
i
think
they
did.
they
said,
“neither
the
holding
of
office,”
you'll
notice
that
that
goes
farther
than
membership,
it
meant
only
membership
in
the
smith
act,
“nor
membership
in
any
communist
organization
by
any
person
shall
constitute
per
se
a
violation
of
subsection
(a)
or
(c)
of
this
section,”
which
means
the
internal
security
act
of
1950.
and
then,
they
added
at
a
later
date,
"or
of
any
other
criminal
statute."
now,
it
was
recognized
that
they
had
taken
care
of
the
problem
of
whether
or
not
the
registration
under
the
internal
security
act
of
1950
would
be
a
crime
under
sections
(a)
or
(c)
of
these
particular
act
that
they
were
passing.
and
then,
it
was
--
the
question
was
raised.
well,
you
don't
do
anything
for
the
smith
act
by
such
language,
and
of
course
that's
true.
it
doesn't
purport
to
have
any
effect
on
anything
else.
and
the
question
was
whether
registration
under
this
internal
security
act
of
1950
might
in
some
way
involve
the
membership
clause
of
the
smith
act
and
to
make
it
clear
that
"per
se"
membership
would
not
be
affected
in
any
way,
they
added,
"or
of
any
other
criminal
statute."
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
and
those
persons,
they
--
they
want
to
reach
by
this
registration
the
members
of
the
communist
party,
but
they
didn't
want
to
reach
anybody
who
is
a
member
per
se
by
the
smith
act
because
it
didn't
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
had
not
provided
any
--
any
provision
for
prosecution
in
the
smith
act
for
those
who
were
just
members
per
se.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
could
be
prosecuted
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
that
was
the
problem
that
was
--
that
they
were
trying
to
deal
with.
and
by
adding
--
by
up
to
the
time
that
they
put
in
the
words
"or
of
any
other
criminal
statute,"
they
had
no
provision
to
take
care
of
the
registration
of
a
member
per
se
which
might
lead
to
some
prosecution
under
the
smith
act
of
the
conspiracy
to
organize
or
advocate
or
overthrow.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
in
the
smith
act,
they
were
also
--
had
the
problem
of
the
other
provisions
of
the
smith
act
in
regard
to
conspiracy
to
organize
and
to
advocate
and
teach
and
that
wasn't
taken
care
of.
if
they
registered
even
though
it
was
just
per
se,
it
might
lead
to
information
where
they
could
prosecute
under
those
provisions
of
the
smith
act
without
regard
to
the
membership
clause
which
was
not
expressly
discussed.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
knowledge
as
to
membership.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
there
are
two
other
provisions
in
the
smith
act
about
organizing
and
advocating
in
teaching
which
the
member
--
the
registration
of
the
member
per
se
might
claim
--
would
lead
to
that
information.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that
case
isn't
before
the
court
and
that
is
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
that's
true.
but
you
also
might
get
leads
from
the
registration
that
would
be
objectionable
and
they
were
trying
to
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
problem
that
congress
had
was
that
it
was
declaring
the
communist
party
to
be
bad
in
the
internal
security
act
of
1950.
and
yet,
in
order
to
make
it
effective
at
all
for
registration,
it
wanted
to
make
it
clear
that
membership
of
the
party
itself
was
conceivably
not
bad.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that's
what
they
were
working
at.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
we're
going
to
add
intent,
too.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
congress
was
trying
to
say
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
congress
is
trying
to
say
that
membership
without
war,
without
knowledge
and
intent
is
not
bad.
and
so,
the
mere
fact
that
you
register
a
membership
is
you
don't
add
anything
to
the
crime,
because
you
can
be
innocent
and
be
a
member
if
there's
nothing
more
than
that.
now,
that's
what
the
burden
of
4
(f)
is.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
they
were
saying
you
could
not.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
congress
was
saying
that
you
couldn't
use
the
registration
to
prove
any
part
of
the
crime.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
they
recognized
the
smith
act
already
provided
that
there
had
to
be
knowing
membership,
and
that
there
could
be
membership
per
se
that
was
perfectly
innocent.
there's
a
recognition
of
that
by
this
particular
language.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
per
se,
whatever
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that
case
isn't
here,
but
it
would
seem
to
follow.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
because
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
he
would
have
to
claim
his
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right,
but
i
--
the
question
was,
if
he
would
claim
his
--
and
the
fact
that
would
incriminate
him,
would
he
have
to
register?
and
he
can
--
i
might
not
claim
his
privilege
and
the
fact
that
he
registered
could
not
be
used
against
him.
but
if
he
did
say
that
it
would
incriminate
him,
object
to
it,
that
was
what
i
was
conceding.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
only
on
the
theory
that
that
might
lead
in
some
way
to
information
toward
his
convictions.
but
the
registration
of
course
could
not
be
used
as
such
against
him
and
he
might
not
claim
his
privilege.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
--
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
my
recollection
of
the
provisions
of
the
internal
security
act
of
1950.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
fact
that
the
registration
of
any
person
under
section
787
or
section
788
of
this
title
as
an
officer
or
member
of
any
communist
organization
shall
not
be
received
in
evidence
against
such
person
in
any
prosecution
for
any
alleged
violation
of
subsection
(a)
or
subsection
(c)
of
this
section
or
of
any
alleged
violation
of
any
other
criminal
statute.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
did
concede
that
it
might
and
that
--
that
would
be
the
reason
why
the
claim
of
--
that
it
might
incriminate
him
would
be
valid
but
he
still
have
to
make
the
claim.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
i
--
i
concede
that.
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
unless
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
that's
what
we
think
the
debates
as
set
out
in
the
brief
shows
congress
was
trying
to
reach.
it
was
a
mere
effect
of
membership
that
could
not
be
used
and
that
they
wanted
to
exclude
so
that
it
wouldn't
bar
the
registration
on
the
reach
of
what
they
accomplish
to
something
else.
but
that
was
their
purpose
and
it
was
suggested
that
when
they
referred
to
this
particular
act
and
not
alone
they
certainly
were
doing
nothing
about
the
problems
in
the
smith
act,
and
that's
why
the
language
of
any
other
statute
was
added
to
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
you
have
a
greater
problem
than
that.
i
think
you
got
a
problem
of
trying
to
construe
both
acts,
the
smith
act
and
this
act,
so
as
to
not
reach
a
constitutional
problem
that
would
destroy
the
statute
if
you
can
help
it.
and
i
think
they
can
be
read
together
under
the
interpretation
that
we
suggest
to
find
that
there
is
some
provision
as
to
registration
(inaudible)
and
also
that
the
smith
act
was
not
affected.
and
i
think
that
you
do
violence
to
the
--
to
everything
congress
was
trying
to
do.
if
you
say
that
in
spite
of
the
recitals
that
congress
made
in
the
internal
security
act
of
1950,
and
again
in
1954,
that
they
were
drawing
a
section
in
the
statute
in
such
a
way
as
to
exclude
from
it
membership
in
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states
and
leave
within
its
purview
all
other
organizations
like
nazi
and
fascist
--
fascist
organizations
which
they
weren't
concerned
with
at
that
time
to
any
extent
as
the
debate
show
and
everything
that
was
done
shows.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
i
--
i
think
that's
correct.
i
do
think
that
congress
was
acting
in
this
area
and
it
was
trying
to
accomplish
something
and
it's
--
it's
plain.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
would
try
to
undertake
to
make
both
provisions
effective
insofar
as
it's
able
to.
and
certainly
it
seems
very
clear
to
me
in
the
debates
that
they
were
well
aware
of
the
decision
in
the
dennis
case
and
we're
not
trying
in
any
way
to
injure
the
smith
act.
i'd
like
to
turn
next
to
the
question
of
the
acts
of
these
petitioner,
his
participation
in
the
question
of
knowledge
and
intent.
the
question
was
asked
whether
or
not
the
government
was
urging
that
this
was
in
the
nature
of
a
conspiracy
like
the
other
provisions
of
the
smith
act.
and
that
is
not
our
contention,
it
wasn't
the
way
the
case
was
tried
below
and
it
isn't
urged
in
our
brief
as
i
understand.
our
contention
is
that
were
you
alleged
that
a
person
joins
a
group
that
necessarily
you
have
some
concert
of
action.
but
you
also
have
to
have
knowledge
of
the
statute
describes
and
we
had
intent
as
a
necessary
element
on
the
theory
that
mens
rea
is
a
generally
presumed
and
require
those
provisions.
i
--
i
can
understand
how
the
petitioner
can
complain
about
that
because
we
are
requiring
a
much
stricter
construction
of
this
statute
than
the
one
that
he
would
argue
for
with
just
knowledge.
we
--
we
require
in
addition
the
element
of
intent
by
the
petitioner
to
accomplish
the
objectives
and
purposes
of
the
party
that
he
joins.
not
only
that
he
has
knowledge
of
the
purposes
and
intents
and
objectives
of
that
party,
but
that
he
personally
intend
to
accomplish
it.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
removes
from
this
problem
of
the
membership
clause
of
the
smith
act
some
of
the
elements
that
could
be
and
probably
would
bother
this
court
a
great
deal
which
involves
the
question
of
the
innocent
person
who
joins
the
party
knowing
some
things
about
it
but
never
having
any
intent
to
try
to
accomplish
them
or
contribute
to
the
accomplishment
of
that
which
case
just
could
be
imagined.
i
think
that's
in
the
periphery
and
we
don't
examine
these
constitutional
questions
by
cases
on
the
periphery.
but
it
would
be
much
more
abolished
than
a
case
under
this
statute
as
interpreted
by
the
government.
it
is
admitted
as
counsel
state
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
we
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we'll
follow
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
we
follow
the
general
thinking
of
the
dennis
case
in
regard
to
that
problem
and
urge
it
in
this
situation.and
tried
the
case
in
the
lower
court
on
that
basis
and
the
constructions
expressly
so
provided
that
there
had
to
be
knowledge
and
intent
as
well
as
the
membership.
they're
very
precise
on
it.
it's
also
conceded
the
fact
that
this
petitioner
was
an
officer
in
the
local
organization
in
carolina,
he
was
a
state
chairman.
he
maintained
a
constant
contact
with
the
national
committee
of
a
party
in
new
york.
he
made
arrangements
for
the
witness
clontz
to
go
to
the
special
school,
the
jefferson
school
of
social
science,
and
have
a
special
course
and
training
in
new
york
city
and
in
that
training
this
witness
was
given
detailed
instruction
in
marxism-leninism.
the
purpose
of
the
party
in
regard
to
revolutionary
purposes
and
the
proletarian
revolution
and
the
accomplishment
of
the
witness.
clontz
came
back
and
discussed
it
these
various
studies
at
length
with
the
petitioner
and
he
indicated
his
belief
in
them
and
his
understanding
and
knowledge
of
those
purposes.
he
then
went
into
the
whole
question
of
the
purposes
of
the
party
with
the
witness
trials
who
was
a
student
in
a
university
there
and
then
discussed
with
him
the
desire
and
ambition
of
the
party,
the
purpose
to
infiltrate
the
trade
unions
and
to
occupy
key
positions
in
the
unions
in
order
to
forward
this
revolution
at
the
earliest
possible
date.
this
was
discussed.
many
urged
that
the
witness
clontz
test
--
attend
a
meeting
that
a
man
by
the
name
of
(inaudible)
came
down
to
new
york
by
arrangement
of
the
petitioner
and
this
--
this
man
said
in
his
talk,
which
the
petitioner
asked
--
wants
to
attend
--
the
revolution
in
the
united
states
was
a
certainty
and
a
necessity
and
would
--
would
be
modeled
on
the
revolution
that
took
place
in
russia.
he
told
clontz
that
about
the
underground
and
the
necessity
of
the
underground
and
that
the
party
would
have
to
carry
on
as
an
underground
when
the
pressure
became
too
great.
he
also
said
that
he
himself
had
gone
underground
and
that
clontz
was
not
to
communicate
to
--
with
him
by
telephone,
telegraph
or
mail.
then
he
arranged
for
the
organization
of
a
school
which
was
very
clandestine
and
all
the
arrangements
for
it
was
held
on
a
farm
and
everybody
who
attended
became
a
student
of
this
school
under
the
direction
of
the
petitioner,
had
aliases
and
they
called
each
other
by
these
various
aliases
rather
than
the
names
that
they
were
known
by.
during
this
school,
the
various
purposes
of
the
party
were
developed
to
some
length,
marxism-leninism,
and
the
purpose
to
accomplish
the
proletarian
revolution
as
soon
as
possible
and
it
was
--
there
was
a
demonstration
in
the
presence
of
the
petitioner
by
one
of
the
leaders
in
which
he
pointed
out
how
murder
could
be
committed
upon
another
person
while
in
a
picket
line
by
the
use
of
a
pencil
driving
it
through
the
throat
or
the
chest.
discussion
was
had
in
some
detail
by
the
witness
as
to
when
the
revolution
could
be
expected,
and
whether
or
not
they
could
expect
any
aid
from
the
soviet
union
and
he
told
the
witness
clontz
that
the
soviet
union
when
the
revolutionary
time
was
ripe
would
come
to
the
aid
of
the
united
states,
or
come
to
the
aid
of
the
party,
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states.
then
there
was
a
list
of
names
of
persons
in
a
western
electric
publication
which
set
out
in
some
detail
the
effect
of
the
communist
party's
activities
in
the
united
states
on
--
in
the
united
states
and
the
industrial
activity.
and
it
was
very
adverse
to
a
communist
party
and
in
this
there
was
a
list
of
names
at
the
end,
and
the
petitioner
said
to
this
witness
that
they
should
keep
those
names
and
when
the
right
time
came
these
people
should
be
shot.
the
witness
childs
was
also
advised
that
the
trade
unions
where
the
school
is
the
revolution
and
we
think
that
this
record
demonstrates
not
only
that
the
activity
of
this
petitioner
was
for
the
party
generally,
but
also
that
he
was
trying
to
do
what
he
could
to
accomplish
the
objects
and
purposes
of
the
party,
and
recruit
members
and
aid
in
every
way
that
he
could
to
the
accomplishment
of
the
objectives
of
the
overthrow
of
the
government
at
the
earliest
possible
date.
in
addition
to
that
there
was
the
evidence
of
witnesses
as
to
the
purposes
of
the
party
and
its
objectives
and
its
objective
to
overthrow
the
government
by
violent
revolution
in
considerable
detail.
a
part
of
this
by
--
was
by
the
witness
and
none
has
been
referred
to
before.
i'd
like
to
briefly
refer
to
the
problem
of
the
constitutional
questions.
we
rely
to
a
considerable
extent
on
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
dennis
case,
but
we
feel
that
the
problems
are
different
in
the
membership
clause
and
the
court
would
certainly
want
to
examine
that
with
reference
to
the
dennis
case
and
the
problems
that
are
involved
in
it.
as
i
stated,
i
think
the
statute
fairly
shows
the
requirement
of
knowledge
and
we
feel
that
the
intent
should
be
included
as
mens
rea
in
the
ordinary
construction
of
criminal
statutes.
the
issue
as
we
see
it
is
whether
or
not
the
congress
has
the
power
to
provide
for
the
proscription
of
membership
with
knowledge
and
the
intent
to
accomplish
the
objectives
of
the
communist
party
in
this
manner.
and
that
there
would
be
a
presumption
of
the
congressional
right
in
the
action
that
congress
take
--
took
being
valid
and
should
be
given
a
great
weight
in
this
--
in
the
consideration
of
this
court
of
the
problem
before
it.
now
the
threat
of
the
communist
party
was
recognized
by
the
court
in
the
dennis
case
and
also
as
we
regarded
in
the
douds
case.
there
have
been
numerous
cases
in
which
the
problem
of
the
communist
party
in
its
--
in
the
prosecution
of
various
defendants
has
been
conducted
under
smith
act
cases.
some
20
cases
and
the
juries
in
each
instance
have
convicted
the
defendants.
the
trial
judges
have
affirmed
that
on
the
evidence
that
was
presented
to
them
and
the
appellate
courts
have
approved
that
in
various
instances
up-to-date.
we
think
that
the
situation
during
this
trial
was
more
aggravated
than
it
was
at
the
time
of
the
dennis
proceeding
in
that
there
was
during
two-thirds
of
the
time
of
this
period
involved
in
this
indictment,
the
korean
conflict
going
on
in
which
we
had
a
large
number
of
american
casualties.
we've
also
had
as
the
court
recognizes
dennis
the
history
of
a
number
of
governments
that
have
fallen
through
the
means
of
the
communist
party
and
its
program
of
trying
to
secure
a
minority
who
would
support
its
program
and
then
secure
control
of
the
police
of
the
country
like
in
poland,
czechoslovakia
and
then
overthrow
of
the
government.
all
of
these
things
seem
to
us
to
demonstrate
the
danger
and
the
present
threat
of
the
party
as
such.
and
here
we
have
a
functionary
of
the
party
who
was
an
officer,
was
an
important
person
in
the
area
of
the
party
activities
in
control
of
the
carolina's
on
behalf
of
the
party,
and
constant
communication
with
it,
actively
recruiting
new
members,
instructing
them
in
the
purposes
of
the
party,
its
objectives
and
revolutionary
designs
and
intending
to
do
all
that
he
had
--
he
could
within
his
power
to
accomplish
those
objectives.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
i
wouldn't
think
so,
no.
i
think
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
you
don't
prove
that
he
intended
to
accomplish
the
objective.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
don't
believe
the
jury
would
convict
him
of
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
because
it
doesn't
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
we
do
and
the
way
we
arrive
at
that,
we
feel
that
the
only
way
you
can
conclude
intent
is
that
you
find
activity
of
some
kind
from
which
you
draw
the
inference
of
intent,
and
unless
there
are
some
activity
that
is
of
important
to
as
difficult
to
draw
the
conclusion
of
intent
to
accomplish
the
objectives
and
purposes
of
this
party
as
distinguished
from
just
a
general
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct.
we
find
--
we
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
find
that
the
action
has
to
be
sufficient
to
make
the
intent
clear
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
the
court
was
--
mr.
chief
justice,
the
court
was
very
precise
about
that
element.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
he
directed
they
must
find
that
it
was
an
incitement
and
also
an
intent
and
that
the
intent
had
to
be
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
do
not.
we
find
--
we
take
the
position
that
you
have
to
find
a
specific
intent
by
the
defendant
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
to
urge
and
accomplish
these
purposes,
these
unlawful
purposes.
and
the
court
so
instructed
instead.
and
a
specific
intent
as
i've
already
indicated
to
you
on
the
part
of
the
accused
to
bring
about
the
overthrow
of
the
government
is
also
necessary
and
an
indispensable
requisite
of
the
offense.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
on
page
111
of
the
record.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
one
way
of
saying
it,
yes.
but
the
--
it
seems
to
me
the
court
is
very
precise
on
that
instruction
being
an
indispensable
requisite
of
the
offense.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
yes.
oh,
he
has
to
have
knowledge
of
the
purposes
of
the
party
and
he
has
to
--
to
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
do
sufficient
acts
so
that
you
can
conclude
that
he
personally
intends
to
accomplish
the
objectives
and
purposes
of
the
party
and
that's
the
instruction
that's
been
given
in
this
case
and
the
other
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
that's
--
that
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
effect
of
it
is
that
once
he
becomes
a
member
and
has
that
knowledge
and
--
and
understands
the
purposes
and
intents,
and
has
the
intent
to
accomplish
those
objectives
that
it
becomes
a
crime
and
that's
what
it
had
to
be
followed
specifically
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
three
or
four
other
matters
that
i
would
like
to
go
into
and
finish
up
on
couple
that
i
don't
think
i
got
completed
last
evening.
first
place,
i'd
like
to
call
attention
to
the
statute
of
limitations
that
i
referred
to,
counsel
for
the
petitioner
asked
me
about
the
section,
and
it's
title
18,
section
3282.
it
became
effective
september
1,
1954
and
extended
the
statute
for
a
period
of
five
years.
you
recall
the
indictment
here
was
november
18th
of
1954.
i
also
want
to
call
the
attention
of
the
court,
however
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
think
the
--
the
question
is
in
the
case
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
because
the
court
instructed
the
jury
that
was
limited
to
the
three-year
period.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
so
we
--
we
don't
have
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
extends
the
period
in
violation
of
their
rights.
now,
with
regard
to
the
internal
security
act,
i'd
like
--
of
1950,
i'd
like
to
call
attention
to
several
things
about
the
pattern
of
that
act.
it
seemed
to
me
that
congress
was
trying
to
provide
for
the
registration,
not
only
of
individuals
which
was
one
of
the
more
remote
provisions
of
the
act,
but
for
registration
of
the
party
and
the
officers
of
the
party,
and
there
were
important
sanctions
with
relation
to
the
failure
of
the
party
itself
to
so
register.
there
was
also
a
provision
that
the
party
did
not
register
and
those
sanctions
came
into
being.
the
officers
were
required
to
register.
and
if
the
officers
failed
to
register,
then
the
members
themselves
would
have
to
register.
but
the
provisions
in
regard
to
the
officers
require
the
registration
as
to
their
functions
and
duties
in
their
office.
that
seemed
to
us
that
the
problem
that
congress
had
was
whether
or
not
by
reason
of
recitals
as
to
the
character
of
the
communist
party
as
a
conspiracy
in
detailed
form
as
was
set
out
in
that
act.
it
might
be
construed
by
the
courts
as
a
provision
in
itself
which,
along
with
the
registration
or
the
membership,
might
establish
the
crime.
and
it
was
that
they
were
trying
to
reach.
now,
when
senator
kilgore
made
his
objections
to
the
form
of
this
proposed
4
(f)
in
connection
with
the
internal
security
act
of
1950,
there
was
no
provision
in
the
act
as
it
then
was
in
regard
to
per
se.
and
in
conference,
they
added
the
provision
in
regard
to
per
se,
limiting
it
to
per
se
as
well
as
the
provision
or
of
any
other
criminal
statute.
i'd
like
to
call
attention
particularly
to
section
17
of
that
same
act,
which
is
set
out
on
page
55
of
our
brief.
there,
congress
provided
the
foregoing
provision
of
this
title
shall
be
construed
as
being
in
addition
to
and
not
in
modification
of
existing
criminal
statutes.
now,
we
think
regardless
of
anything
else
of
our
legislative
history
or
any
other
interpretation
that
you
could
draw
from
the
action
of
congress
in
this
matter
that
that
should
be
conclusive
because
it
seems
to
us,
congress
said,
“whatever
we
do
in
this
internal
security
act
of
1950,
we
just
added
on
top
of
whatever
we
have
done.
and
whatever
you
do
with
it,
don't
take
it
to
try
to
reduce
what
we
already
have.”
now,
i
think
you
have
a
further
problem
if
you
adopt
the
construction
that
is
advanced
by
petitioner's
counsel
in
this
matter
in
regard
to
section
4
(f).
because
if
you
recall,
the
language
of
that
section
does
not
refer
only
to
members
as
had
been
treated
largely
by
petitioner's
counsel
in
the
brief
as
though
it
did.
but
it
also
refers
to
officeholders
and
says
neither
the
holding
of
office
nor
membership
in
any
communist
organization
by
any
person
shall
constitute
per
se
a
violation
of
these
subsections
or
any
other
criminal
statute.
what
is
the
effect
of
that?
if
you
are
going
to
say
that
regardless
of
the
fact
that
congress
deliberately
and
carefully
said
this
should
be
limited
to
per
se
membership
and
not
membership
with
knowledge
as
the
smith
act
said,
then
what
about
the
provisions
about
an
officer
who
is
required
to
register
and
tell
what
his
functions
and
duties
in
his
office
are
with
regard
to
the
other
provisions
of
organization
and
advocacy
in
teaching
in
a
conspiracy
in
the
other
parts
of
the
smith
act?
it
seems
to
me
that
that
forces
upon
the
court
a
construction
that
the
entire
provisions
dealt
within
the
dennis
act
were
intended
by
congress
that
was
discussing
the
successes
of
the
government
in
dealing
with
this
problem
in
the
smith
act
prosecutions
as
an
intention
of
congress
to
wipe
them
all
out,
and
i
don't
think
that
can
be
found.
but
regardless
of
all
the
other
refinements
to
the
argument,
when
you
get
down
to
a
proposition
where
congress
carefully
says,
“in
the
same
statute
practically
at
the
close,
that
regardless
of
what
we
have
done
here,
this
is
not
to
modify
or
reduce
any
of
the
criminal
statutes
that
we've
got
in
regard
to
this
up
to
this
point.”
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
my
interpretation
of
it.
and
i
think
the
court
can
deal
with
it
like
it
did
in
the
hutchinson
case
in
applying
the
norris-laguardia
act
to
the
sherman
act
as
a
matter
of
trying
to
interpret
this
situation,
but
not
to
reduce
the
smith
act
which
congress
was
not,
in
any
mood
or
temper,
to
do
at
the
time
it
passed
this
act.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that's
the
way
we
read
the
history,
that
congress
had
this
question
brought
up
and
it
was
a
possibility.
and
in
order
to
maybe
stamp
on
this
fly
with
an
elephant,
they
want
to
eliminate
and
maybe
even
the
fly
wasn't
there.
and
they
were
trying
to
eliminate
it
with
great
force.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
and
that's
the
way
we
view
the
act
in
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
yes,
mr.
justice.
now,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
next
problem
to
the
question
that
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
which
disturbed
me
and
i
don't
think
i
answered
adequately
for
him
or
for
the
court.
in
regard
to
the
person
who
writes
a
letter
in
--
into
the
party
who
says
that
he's
sending
in
the
dues
and
he
believes
in
the
party,
in
its
objectives,
in
its
purposes
and
its
intent
to
accomplish
a
revolution
by
force
and
violence,
we
suggest
that
that
has
knowledge
and
that
has
intent,
why
isn't
that
a
crime
under
the
statute?
and
the
thing
that
disturbed
me
about
is
whether
or
not
you
had
membership
in
that
situation.
in
fact,
and
i
think
that
you
have
to
start
with
genuine
membership.
we're
familiar
in
--
in
our
activities
in
life
that
there's
all
kinds
of
membership,
inactive,
active,
and
the
various
organizations
and
many
of
them
like
various
lodges
or
--
or
groups
you
can't
get
into
by
merely
writing
letter
saying
you're
for
everything
that
they're
intending
to
do
or
the
objects
and
purposes
that
they
have
in
mind
in
sending
the
necessary
money.
you
have
to
comply
with
their
requirements
before
becoming
a
member.
and
that
is
one
--
that
is
the
first
step.
now,
what
does
the
communist
party
require
in
regard
to
membership?
the
government's
exhibit
number
39
is
a
1948
constitution
of
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states
was
submitted
in
evidence
in
this
case.
and
in
article
2,
section
3,
it
is
stated,
“a
party
member
is
one
who
accepts
the
aims,
principles
and
program
of
the
party
as
determined
by
its
constitution
and
conventions,
who
belongs
to
a
club
and
attend
these
meetings,
who
is
active
in
behalf
of
the
party
program,
who
reads,
and
circulates
the
party
press
and
literature,
and
who
pays
dues
regularly.”
now,
that
is
the
only
evidence
that
i
know
of
in
the
case
as
to
the
requirements
of
membership
in
the
communist
party
except
as
you
can
deduce
them
from
the
actions
of
the
petitioner
and
the
witnesses
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
thing
that
bothers
me
is
there's
another
requirement
in
the
--
in
their
constitution.
he
must
--
it
says,
“who
is
active
in
behalf
of
the
party
program,
who
reads
and
circulates
the
party
press
and
literature,
and
who
pays
dues
regularly.”
now,
if
you'll
assume
all
of
those
things
in
your
question,
then
i'll
--
i
think
i
can
answer
it.
but
you
didn't
seem
to
me
to
assume
all
of
those
things,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
that
we
would
have
difficulty
with
the
court
if
he
would
prove
that
he
did
not
--
he
was
not
active
in
behalf
of
the
party
program.
in
defense,
if
we
would
prove
affirmatively
that
he
did
all
of
the
things
that
you
described
and
he
would
prove
that
he
was
not
in
fact
active
in
behalf
of
the
party
program,
i
think
the
court
could
fairly
conclude
that
he
was
not
in
fact
a
member
of
the
communist
party
under
the
statute.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
he
could
be
a
member
per
se.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that's
a
possibility.
but
i
think
that
the
statute
should
be
construed
fairly
to
require
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
of
the
party.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
now,
i
--
i
didn't
answer
yet
the
question
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
i
--
i
was
going
to
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
was
going
to
turn
to
that
next.
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
we
think
that
that
--
the
intent
should
be
read
in
as
a
matter
of
mens
rea
and
the
usual
interpretation
of
criminal
statutes
and
find
it
there
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
might
be
several
factors.
that
might
be
one
of
them.
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
not
necessarily
because
he
might
not
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
constitution
of
being
an
active
member
in
trying
to
further
the
purposes
of
the
party.
he
might
intend
it
do
it
wholly,
and
i
think
that
was
the
question
that
mr.
justice
harlan
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
that
was
the
next
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
we
do
that
in
--
in
the
way
we
think
the
court
did
in
the
dennis
case
in
examining
the
constitutional
question
in
which
we
think
the
court
dealt
with
the
problem
and
said
congress
covered
this
particular
type
of
crime.
now,
how
far
can
the
congress
reach
constitutionally
in
limiting
free
speech
in
dealing
with
this
particular
situation?
and
is
the
threat
sufficient
weighed
against
the
constitutional
limitation
to
permit
congress
to
reach
this
far?
and
we
then
say
that
only
for
the
purpose,
not
as
a
component
part
of
the
crime,
but
for
determining
the
--
the
limitations
regarding
the
constitutional
limitations,
that
we
consider
active
as
being
an
important
portion.
of
course,
he
would
have
to
satisfy
the
organizational
requirements.
i'd
like
to
briefly
call
attention
to
one
more
matter
and
that
is
the
testimony
in
regard
to
the
witness'
statements
as
to
when
he
expected
this
revolution
to
occur.
and
i
--
we
definitely
disagree
with
counsel's
statement
it
was
any
20
years
hence.
i
call
attention
to
the
statement
of
the
testimony
on
page
16
of
our
brief
and
41
of
the
record
in
which
it
was
stated
that
the
petitioner
predicted
to
klans
when
the
revolution
would
take
place.
in
the
following
language,
he
commented
that
in
july
of
1917,
the
czar
had
driven
the
communist
party
of
russia
underground
and
had
outlawed
them.
he
said
that
the
very
next
october,
the
communist
party,
the
bolsheviks
had
managed
to
bring
about
the
revolution.
scales
said
he
saw
a
perfect
analogy
here
in
this
country.
he
said
that
as
soon
as
the
capitalists
drive
us
underground,
there
will
be
a
revolution.
he
said
that
if
the
depression
came
along,
that
would
accelerate
it
still
further
and
would
make
the
job
easier.
now,
the
jury
had
before
it,
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
himself
told
the
witnesses
that
he
had
gone
underground,
so
the
underground
movement
had
occurred.
and
this
is
when
he
predicted
that
the
revolution
would
occur
and
it
seems
to
me
it
shows
his
idea
of
the
immanency
of
a
threat
of
his
action.
