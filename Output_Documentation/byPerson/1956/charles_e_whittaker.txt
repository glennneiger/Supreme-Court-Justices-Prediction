was
that
possibility
foreclosed
by
the
court
of
appeals
decision?
justice
whittaker
possibility
that
the
government
might
on
the
retrial
have
sufficient
evidence
to
support
the
lesser
included
offense
of
second
degree
murder?
justice
whittaker
but
sir
does
it
make
it
any
difference
to
your
position,
that
whether
the
--
a
second
degree
murder
charge
was
embraced
within
the
indictment
or
not?
justice
whittaker
but
in
any
event
he
was
under
this
indictment
charged
with
first
degree
murder
and
he
was
not
convicted
of
first
degree
murder,
that's
your
position.
justice
whittaker
and
you
follow
that
by
saying
that
necessary
instance
is
or
the
necessary
legal
result
is
to
acquit
him
of
first
degree
murder.
justice
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
whittaker
that
is
you
don't
construe
the
waiver
(inaudible)
justice
whittaker
i
would
like
--
i
would
like
to
ask
you
one
question
at
least,
pardon
me
mr.
sand.
i
understood
you
to
say
that
you
(inaudible)
case.
now,
you
said
that
at
the
beginning
and
i
foresee
you
do
now.
was
the
law
in
the
philippines
at
that
time
as
to
what
constitutes
a
trial,
similar
to
what
constitutes
a
(inaudible)
court
in
the
trial
therein
even
now?
was
it
not
the
law
there
then
that
a
trial
in
the
court
of
first
instance
so-called
or
before
a
magistrate
was
as
commented
upon,
both
in
kepner
and
in
trono,
a
preliminary
or
an
investigatory
proceeding
and
that
review
as
of
right
existed
to
the
so-called
supreme
court
of
the
islands
which
had
the
power
to
try
the
case,
de
novo
on
both
the
law
and
facts.
and
must
not
what
is
said
by
this
court
in
that
case,
be
read
against
that
factual
background
even
though
it
did
say
that
the
case
should
be
considered
as
one
having
been
tried
in
a
federal
district
court.
justice
whittaker
then
if
i
may
break
in
like
that.
then,
would
not
the
jeopardy
necessarily
continue
under
that
situation
until
the
completion
of
the
trial,
which
could
and
only
this,
the
judgement
of
the
supreme
court?
justice
whittaker
the
double
jeopardy
provision.
justice
whittaker
but
my
question
a
while
ago
was
that
if
a
trial
under
the
existing
law
at
that
time,
the
philippine
islands
consisted
on.
both
this
preliminary
hearing
and
for
the
first
instance
and
a
de
novo
trial
on
review
upon
both
the
law
and
the
facts
in
the
supreme
court
then
wouldn't
necessarily
jeopardy
have
to
continue
until
there
had
been
an
end
of
the
trial
which
concluded
with
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
islands.
justice
whittaker
i
--
i
wonder
what
it
is
to
be
said
or
the
possible
confusion
that
justice
holmes'
dissent
in
the
trono
case
is
to
be
read
against
that
background
of
the
preliminary
trial
and
the
final
trial
in
the
supreme
court
as
a
continuing
jeopardy?
