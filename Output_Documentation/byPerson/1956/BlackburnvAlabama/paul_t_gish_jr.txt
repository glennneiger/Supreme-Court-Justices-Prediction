mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
honorable
chief
justice
and
if
the
court
please.
after
entering
all
of
the
suggestion,
my
position
in
this
case,
the
implication
of
the
state
of
alabama
is
and
there
was
a
place
in
the
fact
which
was
decided
by
the
trial
judge
first
and
then
again
by
the
trial
jury
as
to
whether
or
not
this
petitioner
was
insane
at
the
time
he
confessed
on
the
one
hand
and
--
and
the
time
of
the
crime
on
the
other
hand.
now,
that
question
of
fact
of
rightness
we
submit
in
this
matter
on
page
32
of
the
record.
the
--
is
the
--
about
the
man
which
the
prosecutor
faced
attempted
to
introduce
a
confession.
now,
on
that
page
the
deputy
sheriff
who
received
the
confession
testified
and
the
--
there
was
no
threshold
rule
on
interval.
he
testified
to
enough,
to
rebut
the
presumption
that
it
was
involuntary
in
a
normal
case.
now,
at
that
point,
the
defense
objected
and
offered
evidence
on
voir
dire
after
a
question
that
the
jury
be
excused
on
voir
dire
examination.
now,
in
the
offer
of
what
they
were
going
to
prove
on
voir
dire
there,
they
mentioned
the
records
of
the
veterans
administration
as
to
jesse
blackburn's
mental
condition
in
years
past.
actually,
when
they
got
into
offering
the
evidence,
that
evidence
of
the
records
of
the
veterans
administration
were
not
presented
on
voir
dire.
therefore,
the
only
thing
that
the
defense
offered
on
voir
dire
were
the
two
depositions
of
two
of
the
members
of
the
lunacy
commission.
the
defense
did
not
even
offer
the
deposition
of
the
third
member
of
the
lunacy
commission
and
it's
obvious
that
the
reason
they
didn't
do
any
of
this,
his
answers
were
conflicting
with
the
other
two.
they
would
have
entered
in
a
peculiar
position
had
they
offered
an
oath
through
each
definitions.
the
state
on
voir
dire
offered
the
deposition
of
the
third
doctor
whose
evidence
conflicted
with
the
other
two.
and
in
addition,
continued
to
examine
the
deputy
sheriff
stanford
on
voir
dire.
now,
at
the
end
of
that
voir
dire
examination,
that
is
when
the
trial
judge
made
his
determination
that
the
confession
should
be
received
in
evidence.
and
one
of
your
honors
asked
mr.
hobbs
whether
he
makes
any
at
all
a
determination
as
i
understood
it
as
to
mental
insanity,
he
did
not.
the
jury,
you
see,
has
not
even
been
present.
they've
been
away
from
the
courtroom,
then
they
come
back
and
the
judge
merely
allows
the
objection
--
the
confession
in
evidence
over
the
objection
of
the
defendant
to
support
the
juries'
concern
up
to
that
point.
they
have
no
implication,
no
evidence
before
them
as
to
the
man's
mental
condition.
now,
on
--
on
this
voir
dire
examination
in
the
case
at
bar,
we
have
as
mr.
hobbs
stated
statements
showing
that
jesse
blackburn
was
sane
from
the
deputy
sheriff
--
i
think
that
--
when
he
was
cross-examined.
his
--
his
testimony
on
voir
dire
begins
on
page
99.
he
was
examined
and
cross-examined
on
the
sanity
proposition
on
voir
dire.
now,
in
addition
to
his
testimony,
we
have
as
i
have
mentioned
the
depositions
of
the
three
doctors,
two,
introduce
by
the
defendant
and
one
by
the
state
below.
the
report
of
the
lunacy
commission
and
that's
all
it
is,
it's
a
report
to
the
trial
judge
for
his
guidance
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
put
this
man
to
trial
or
to
send
him
to
the
hospital
until
he
can
stand
trial.
the
report
of
this
commission
was
that
the
petitioner
was
insane.
defendant
was
insane
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
but
now,
when
you
get
to
the
voir
dire
examination,
these
interrogatories
which
were
introduced
by
these
doctors
on
voir
dire,
you
--
you
run
into
the
conflict
which
we
say
is
in
the
evidence
in
this
case
and
i've
mentioned
a
few
question
on
fact
which
was
properly
left
by
the
alabama
court
of
appeals
to
the
trial
judge
in
the
trial
jury.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
yes.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
yes
--
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
you
--
you
--
right
now,
i
believe
that
all
three
depositions
were
instituted
by
the
defendant.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
and
available
for
cross-interrogatories
by
the
states.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
but
when
they
came
to
trial,
the
defendant
didn't
see
fit
to
introduce
in
evidence
--
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
--
decisions
of
dr.
richards.
they
introduced
the
direct
interrogatories
of
dr.
tarwater
and
dr.
rowe
and
the
state
introduced
the
cross-interrogatories
of
both
those
doctors
plus
the
direct
and
cross
of
dr.
richards.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
it
would
seem
so,
your
honor,
from
that
answer.
now,
my
references
here
in
my
notes
to
these
interrogatories
of
--
early
in
the
record
of
mine
on
voir
dire,
you
see
they
went
in
twice,
once
on
voir
dire
and
once
in
the
case
in
chief.
now,
on
page
82
and
83,
interrogatories,
there
are
number
of
6,
7,
8,
9,
10,
14,
15
and
16,
they
were
dr.
richards'
answers
to
these
questions
which
are
in
direct
conflict
with
what
he
himself
stated
in
this
answer.
in
those
interrogatories,
in
answer
to
those
interrogatories,
he
said
one
time
the
petitioner
has
been
normal,
mentally
(inaudible).
he
was
asked
about
this
--
the
petitioner's
mental
conditions
on
the
date
of
the
crime
and
he
said
they
were
normal.
he
was
asked
about
his
mental
condition
on
april
8th,
1948,
the
date
of
the
confession
and
his
words
were
it
was
good.
for
that
reason,
i
beg
to
disagree
with
mr.
hobbs
in
his
interpretation
that
normal
mental
--
he
was
normally
insane.
i
can't
read
that
into
it
at
all.
if
that
were
true,
surely,
the
word
good
would
amend
that.
now,
the
other
two
doctors
testimony
were
more
damaging
to
the
state
than
was
dr.
richards.
but
dr.
rowe
stated
that
he
was
more
normal
than
it
is
normal
and
that
he
had
lucid
intervals.
but
i
think
and
submit
for
the
state
of
alabama
that
the
significant
part
of
these
depositions
lie
in
the
answers
of
the
doctors
which
clearly
show
that
the
--
they
didn't
give
much
time
to
this
case.
they
--
they
--
of
course
i
know
nothing
about
medicine
but
i
--
i
don't
see
how
when
the
man
is
committed
and
when
the
doctors
take
six
months
to
report,
how
they
can
testify
this
--
what
the
dr.
tarwater
says,
“i
saw
him
at
most
two
or
two-and-a-half
hours
would
cover
the
entire
time
that
i
joined
during
his
stay
in
the
hospital."
dr.
richards
when
this
--
explicit
and
he
gives
that
(inaudible),
"i
didn't
see
him
very
often."
the
other
doctor
says,
"i
saw
--
saw
him
maybe
twice
a
week
but
some
of
those
times
were
on
general
ward
rounds."
i
submit
that
that
could
be
considered
probably
by
the
trial
judge
on
voir
dire
and
by
the
jury
in
the
case
in
chief
as
going
to
the
weight
of
the
report
made
by
the
lunacy
commission.
now,
mr.
justice
whittaker
asked
about
the
adjudication
aspect
of
that
report.
that
report
is
--
is
not
an
adjudication
of
insanity,
it's
a
gap
for
the
trial
judge
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
man
can
be
put
on
trial.
now,
even
when
the
depositions
were
offered
in
the
case
in
chief
when
they
were
offered
on
voir
dire,
the
report
was
attached
as
an
exception
to
the
deposition.
but
under
implications
in
alabama
the
report
cannot
be
offered
in
the
evidence.
so
when
they
came
to
offer
the
depositions
in
evidence
in
the
case
in
chief
before
the
jury,
the
judge
refused
to
allow
the
report
to
go
in
and
as
they
properly
so
--
because
there
is
no
adjudication,
it
is
to
say
the
least
an
ex
parte
matter
(inaudible)
cross-examination
and
then
should
not
be
in
evidence
and
what's
not
in
this
case.
now,
what
we
have
in
this
case
is
a
trial
judge,
who
he
is
--
the
evidence
of
three
doctors
and
the
testimony
of
the
deputy
sheriff,
that
with
all
those
offered
to
him
on
voir
dire
then
he
makes
a
determination
in
the
essence
of
the
jury.
he
says
at
the
confession,
“if
voluntary,
we'll
receive
and
bring
the
jury
back
again."
the
jury
back
again
and
all
of
that
evidence
were
reintroduced
before
them
and
in
addition
thereto
that
is
where
the
records
of
the
veterans
administration
were
introduced.
the
trial
judge,
at
the
time
he
--
he
made
his
determination,
knew
nothing
of
those
records.
he
couldn't
have
known.
they
were
introduced
later
but
even
so,
the
jury
honorably
are
not
guilty
by
insanity
not
only
found
him
guilty
but
one
of
your
honors
as
mr.
hobbs,
about
the
full
determination
aspect
even
after
the
trial
judge
had
admitted
the
confession
into
evidence.
he
charges
the
jury.
that's
on
page
234
of
the
record.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
yes.
in
the
last
paragraph,
little
half
way
down.
begins
now
and
gentlemen,
the
state
introducing
the
evidence
in
written
paper.
and
that
goes
on
to
the
end
of
that
paragraph.
now,
at
the
very
end,
he
is
telling
the
jury
this.
he
said
if
the
defendant
signed
--
signed
the
paper,
he
--
you
make
up
your
minds,
these
things,
if
the
jury
signed
the
paper,
was
he
insane
in
denying
he's
not.
if
the
defendant
signed
the
paper
and
he
had
the
known
capacity
of
knowing
and
to
remember
that
which
he
was
saying
is
empirical?
then
he
goes
on
down,
beginning
the
second
sentence
in
the
next
paragraph.
he
said
gentlemen,
the
jury,
if
you
reach
the
affirmative
answers,
says
this
in
substance,
if
you
reach
the
affirmative
answers
to
the
those
questions
that
i
have
asked
you
above,
do
not
give
any
weight
to
the
confession.
so
even
after
he
--
and
made
his
determination
that
the
confession
was
voluntary.
he
is
still
in
that
sense
leaves
it
up
to
the
jury.
now,
i
think
that
that
is
perfectly
proper
under
to
our
practice.
we
have
in
line
of
cases
which
holds
that
any
evidence
offered
on
voir
dire
can
go
to
the
admissibility
of
the
confession
in
the
evidence.
however,
the
cases
say
that
if
the
defendant
waits
and
holds
back
evidence
or
doesn't
introduce
the
evidence
as
was
done
in
this
case
in
regard
to
the
veterans
administration
records,
if
you
hold
it
by
--
until
after
the
end
of
the
board
trial
examination,
then
the
evidence
that
you
do
introduce
in
the
case
in
chief
goes
only
to
the
weight
of
the
confession.
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
reason
that
the
trial
judge
was
so
implicit
in
his
charge
to
the
jury
and
it
is
important
that
we
just
examine
because
he
realize
that
you
gentlemen,
the
jury
he
was
saying,
have
before
you
much
more
evidence
in
regard
to
this
man's
insanity
then
i
have
before
me,
when
i
allowed
the
confession
in
evidence.
in
any
case,
there
was
still
a
question
of
fact
because
of
the
testimony
of
the
deputy
sheriff
and
because
of
the
conflict
in
the
lack
of
observation
made
by
the
--
by
the
lunacy
commission
and
because
the
jury
told
the
defendant
on
the
stand.
and
it
was
true,
it
was
four
years
later.
however,
they
were
in
a
much
better
position
than
it
was
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
alabama
and
seeing
him,
the
other
witness'
plan.
and
my
interpretation
of
the
decision
of
the
court
--
court
of
appeals
of
alabama
differs
from
that.
and
mentioned
by
mr.
hobbs,
when
he
says
that
when
they
talk
about
the
discretion
below,
they're
measuring
it
in
conjunction
with
the
rule
that
was
mentioned
by
mr.
justice
brennan
a
moment
ago.
to
me,
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
is
saying
that
you
(inaudible)
your
conflict,
the
lack
of
evidence
down
there,
we
as
the
court
of
appeals
of
alabama
don't
know
whether
this
man
was
insane
or
not
under
the
record
and
we
can't
determine.
it's
not
up
to
us
to
determine,
a
new
trial
judge
and
you
trial
jury
have
already
made
that
determination.
and
since
this
record
has
conflicting
evidence
in
it,
we
won't
disturb
your
determination.
that
is
the
way
i
interpret
the
--
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
alabama.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
i
would
have
to
answer
substantially
like
mr.
hobbs
did
by
stating
that
the
trial
judge
submitted
it
in
his
instructions
to
the
jury.
he
said
that
if
you
don't
find
at
the
confession,
if
you
don't
give
any
weight
to
the
confession,
then
you
have
--
your
case
must
be
based
on
circumstantial
evidence.
then
the
case
would
be
much
weaker,
much,
much
weaker.
i
will
be
the
first
to
admit
that
but
i
do
think
that
there's
enough
in
this
record
to
make
a
jury
question
without
the
confession.
i
do
not
think
that
a
general
charge
would
have
probably
been
given
in
the
case.
the
--
as
i've
stated
in
the
evidence
which
comes
in
after
the
conclusion
of
voir
dire
only
goes
to
the
weight
of
the
confession
on
our
practice.
now,
the
last
motion
to
exclude
this
confession
and
there
were
a
number
--
number
of
them,
number
of
objection
and
motion
to
exclude.
the
last
one
in
this
record
was
made
when
the
state
rested
its
case.
in
other
words,
before
all
of
the
testimonies
which
the
defense
had
in
regard
to
insanity
was
before
for
the
court
and
throughout
they
knew
--
knew
nothing
on
the
veterans'
records
at
the
time
of
the
last
motion
to
exclude.
the
trial
judge
not
only
pointed
out
in
his
instructions
to
the
jury
the
parts
that
i
have
mentioned
just
a
moment
ago
by
the
confession.
but
in
addition,
he
was
--
given
their
clear
instruction
as
to
the
jury's
duty
on
the
plea
of
insanity
without
regard
to
the
confession.
in
other
words,
the
only
thing
that
i
am
saying
here
is
that
the
jury
had
before
it
all
of
--
the
attention
was
brought
vividly
to
the
question
of
insanity
all
through
this
case.
now,
i
submit
that
the
question
of
insanity,
the
question
of
the
--
in
whether
i'm
right
in
my
interpretation
that
we
had
a
question
of
fact
or
whether
i'm
wrong
is
the
only
thing
in
this
case
here
in
this
court.
now,
the
petitioner
attempts
in
brief
to
bring
in
within
some
of
the
decision
of
this
court,
notably
turner
versus
pennsylvania,
harris
versus
south
carolina
and
like
cases,
but
i
submit
it
is
not
in
this
record.
the
petitioner
was
questioned
on
may
the
8th,
1948.
the
deputy
sheriff
was
testifying
in
1953.
he
said,
i
can't
remember
the
exact
times
but
as
--
i
was
talking
to
judges
sometime
after
lunch,
probably
about
1
o'clock.
he
said,
i
know
we
took
both
down
to
the
supper.
he
says,
“well,
you
could
think
about
it,
about
an
hour."
and
he
said
i
questioned
him
after
supper
from
probably
about
7
o'clock
or
maybe
10
or
11.
the
confession
was
handwritten
by
the
deputy
sheriff.
it's
a
10-page
confession
and
detailed
very
vividly,
the
trip
from
chicago,
illinois
back
to
after
the
defendant
was
arrested
in
carrying
the
act.
the
confession
has
many
misspelled
words
or
many
grammatical
errors,
it
was
a
terrible
penmanship.
the
only
reason
i'm
bringing
that
out
is
to
put
this
point
forward
that
the
deputy
sheriff
obviously
was
not
an
educated
man.
obviously,
he
did
not
write
this
10-page
confession
in
15
and
20
minutes.
it
--
it
took
a
man
of
his
education
much
longer
to
write
this
confession
and
get
it
down
in
writing
than
it
would
have
a
stenographer
say
or
even
someone
who
could
just
--
writing
with
the
average
speed.
i'm
bringing
that
out
to
say
that
most
of
this
time,
not
most
of
course
but
some
of
this
time
as
basically
that
night
of
may
8th
were
not
taken
up
with
questioning
jesse
blackburn
but
rather
was
taken
up
with
getting
forward,
jesse
blackburn
said
down
in
writing
because
we
don't
know
exactly
how
much
time
that
takes
off.
but
this
isn't
all
of
this
question
and
even
if
the
man
had
had
a
stenographer
there
didn't
amount
to
but
nine
or
10
hours
and
there
was
no
showing
that
the
man
was
coerced
in
any
manner
whatsoever.
and
the
petitioner
tries
to
--
to
bring
in
relay
questioning
in
this
case.
well,
i
submit
that
the
record
just
doesn't
bear
that
out
at
all.
deputy
sheriff
stanford
says,
“i
am
the
one
who
received
his
confession.
i'm
the
one
who
talked
to
this
man.”
yes,
the
sheriff
and
another
--
another
deputy
were
there
at
some
time
but
i
was
their
all
the
time.
and
he
said
in
answer
to
a
question
said,
yes,
they
might
have
asked
some
questions.
this
was
four
years
later.
he
was
remembering
that
he
talked
to
this
defendant,
that
he
was
the
man
who
received
this
man's
confession
and
wrote
it
down,
but
he
wouldn't
--
he
wouldn't
say
and
for
sure
that
they
didn't
come
in
and
hear
us
talking.
and
i
asked
the
question
as
amended
that
all
this
record
bear
it
out
on
any
question
of
relay
questioning.
there
were
no
evidence
of
any
cruelties.
there
were
no
evidence
of
any
loss
of
sleep
or
denial
of
food.
this
record
just
doesn't
bear
it
out.
we
submit,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
this
case
has
one
--
in
which
as
i
have
said
in
lieu
of
the
question
of
fact
and
that
question
was,
was
this
defendant
or
was
he
not
insane?
we
submit
that
the
trial
court
afforded
the
defendant
below
every
legal
opportunity
to
go
forward
with
the
evidence
in
any
--
every
legal
manner.
now,
that
the
defendant
did
present
his
evidence
and
that
evidence
was
in
conflict
with
other
evidence
in
the
case.
and
that
therefore,
the
court
of
appeals
rightfully
held
that
the
trial
judge
and
the
trial
jury
had
merely
decided
a
question
of
fact.
now,
we
would
be
the
first
to
admit
that
if
this
man
was
insane,
of
course
all
cases,
your
cases
and
the
cases
in
the
courts
of
alabama
and
the
cases
everywhere
say
that
he
can't
confess
if
he
was
insane.
since
there
was
a
question
of
fact
as
to
whether
or
not
he
was
insane
in
this
case,
both
at
the
time
he
confessed
and
at
the
time
of
crime,
answers
in
both
those
questions
have
been
determined
under
the
practice
of
alabama
by
the
trial
judge
and
then
again
by
the
trial
jury.
we
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
alabama
did
not
violate
any
right
generally
to
this
petitioner
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
thank
you.
