mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes,
sir.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
jesse
blackburn.
jesse
blackburn
was
convicted
of
the
crime
of
robbery
in
the
state
of
alabama.
the
crime
for
which
he
was
convicted
was
a
brutal
one.
it
involved
the
armed
assault
and
serious
injury
to
the
operator
of
a
rolling
country
store
in
the
rural
county
of
colbert
county.
it
was
the
contention
of
jesse
blackburn
in
his
trial
and
it
has
been
throughout
the
appellate
procedures
in
alabama
that
his
conviction
rested
on
a
confession
of
it
--
the
admission
of
a
confession
into
evidence
was
improper
that
the
confession
was
involuntary.
and
in
our
petition
for
certiorari,
we
had
the
consideration
of
that
question
by
this
court
whether
the
confession
in
that
case
was
involuntary
and
therefore
violated
the
due
process
clause
of
the
constitution.
the
facts
--
the
immediate
facts
surrounding
the
confession
of
jesse
blackburn
all
came
from
the
deputy
sheriff
who
took
that
confession.
this
was
true
because
jesse
blackburn
testified
in
the
trial
and
stated
that
he
had
no
recollection
whatsoever
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
that
confession.
in
fact,
he
testified
that
he
had
no
recollection
of
anything
that
had
occurred
for
several
months
prior
to
his
confession
and
for
several
months
thereafter.
this
was
not
an
inconsistent
statement
for
jesse
blackburn
to
make
because
his
medical
records
in
--
from
government
insane
hospital
showed
that
recurrently
jesse
blackburn
suffered
from
complete
amnesia
for
long
periods
of
time.
so
then
again,
as
to
the
immediate
facts
surrounding
that
confession,
we
take
it
entirely
from
the
testimony
of
the
deputy
sheriff
who
obtained
the
confession.
his
testimony
showed
that
shortly
sometime
after
jesse
blackburn's
arrest,
he
was
confined
to
jail
in
colbert
county
and
was
taken
into
a
small
room
there
in
the
jail,
which
he
described
as
a
room
four
feet
by
six
feet
or
six
feet
by
eight
feet.
we
call
it
a
table
size
room
and
he
was
interrogated
there
by
the
--
this
deputy
sheriff
and
two
other
police
officers
whom
he
said
came
in
and
out
for
some
nine
or
10
hours.
the
testimony
of
the
deputy
was
that
they
did
knock
off
the
questioning
for
about
an
hour
while
they
had
supper.
and
after
supper,
the
--
the
questioning
continued
until
10
or
11
o'clock
at
night.
in
its
brief
filed
in
this
court,
the
state
of
alabama
has
suggested
that
the
only
person
that
questioned
jesse
during
all
this
period
of
time
was
this
deputy
sheriff
stanford.
the
record
itself
discloses,
however,
that
the
deputy
sheriff
stated
that
there
were
these
other
law
enforcement
officers
who
were
coming
in
and
out
and
that
in
answer
to
a
question
as
to
whether
any
of
these
law
enforcement
officers
asked
questions,
he
said
they
might
have
asked
some
questions
and
then
the
question
was
asked,
did
these
questions
relate
to
the
facts
in
this
case
and
his
answer
was
yes.
so
we
think
here
that
without
any
real
question,
we
have
a
situation
where
this
man
was
questioned
almost
unceasingly
for
nine
or
10
hours
by
relays
of
law
enforcement
officers
in
this
table
sized
room
in
this
jail
down
in
colbert
county.
we
think
such
a
confession,
even
if
jesse
blackburn
had
been
a
person
of
normal
will
and
mind,
would
raise
substantial
doubts
as
to
whether
it
would
square
with
the
constitutional
requirements
of
due
process
of
law.
but
in
this
case
we
don't
have
a
person
who
was
of
sound
mind
or
sound
will.
jesse
blackburn
was
a
young
negro,
25
years
old
when
this
alleged
crime
was
committed.
he
had
been
in
the
armed
services
during
world
war
ii.
and
in
1944,
he
was
discharged
from
the
army
as
permanently
mentally
defective.
the
army
medical
board
that
surveyed
him
out
of
the
army,
recommended
that
he
be
transferred
to
a
government
insane
institution,
and
he
went
from
the
army
to
a
government
insane
institution.
the
diagnosis
at
that
time
for
jesse
blackburn
was
that
he
was
a
victim
of
dementia
praecox
which
in
other
places
they
call
schizophrenia,
simple
type,
that
he
had
a
history
of
hallucinations
and
defective
judgment
and
insight.
and
jesse
blackburn
remained
in
this
government
insane
institution
from
1944
until
sometime
in
1948.
in
november
1946,
the
medical
--
the
government
hospital
rated
jesse
blackburn
100%
mentally
incompetent.
in
february
of
1948,
he
was
released
into
the
custody
of
his
sister
for
a
10-day
leave
from
the
insane
hospital.
when
the
10
days
was
up,
jesse
didn't
return
to
the
hospital.
instead
a
short
time
thereafter,
he
left
his
home
in
chicago
and
came
to
alabama
to
attend
the
funeral
of
his
brother.
it
was
--
while
he
was
on
this
trip
to
alabama,
that
the
crime
for
which
he
was
convicted
was
committed.
his
medical
records
at
this
government
insane
hospital
state,
however,
and
they
automatically
discharged
jesse
when
he
didn't
return
after
90
days.
his
medical
record
stated
that
on
his
discharge
"the
diagnosis
of
schizophrenic
reaction,
paranoid
type,
remains
unchanged."
and
he
was
considered
incompetent
at
the
time
of
his
release.
now,
we
think
it's
significant
in
this
case
that
this
issue
of
insanity
was
not
first
raised
by
petitioner's
counsel.
it
was
raised
by
the
very
persons
who
obtained
the
confession
from
him.
it
was
raised
by
the
jailer
and
the
deputy
sheriff,
and
the
sheriff
who
watched
him
there
in
the
jail.
they
testified
that
a
short
time
or
some
little
time
or
we
don't
know
exactly
the
period,
but
it
couldn't
have
been
more
than
a
few
days
or
very
few
weeks.
they
communicated
to
the
circuit
judge
in
colbert
county
that
jesse
showed
signs
of
insanity.
and
the
circuit
judge
called
in
certain
lay
persons
in
the
community
and
three
local
doctors
to
examine
jesse
blackburn.
all
of
the
persons
who
examined
him
apparently
found
reasonable
grounds
for
believing
him
insane.
the
two
doctors,
there's
a
statement
from
them
in
the
record,
they
weren't
psychiatrist,
they
were
just
medical
doctors.
they
stated
that
in
their
judgment
jesse
blackburn
was
not
mentally
able
to
stand
trial
at
that
time.
on
receiving
these
communications,
the
circuit
judge,
pursuant
to
the
statute
of
alabama,
had
jesse
transferred
to
the
state
insane
hospital
and
a
sanity
commission
was
appointed
which
had
as
its
head,
the
superintendent
of
the
state
mental
hospitals
in
alabama,
dr.
tarwater.
dr.
tarwater
pointed
the
other
two
members
of
this
sanity
commission
that
examined
jesse
blackburn.
after
their
examination
and
they
kept
jesse
blackburn
in
--
under
observation
for
some
months
before
rendering
a
report,
they
were
unanimous
in
their
conclusion
that
jesse
blackburn
was
insane
when
he
was
examined
by
the
sanity
commission,
that
in
their
judgment
he
was
insane
when
the
alleged
crime
was
committed
and
in
their
judgement,
he
was
insane
when
his
confession
was
received.
the
respondent
in
its
brief
has
suggested
that
there's
a
conflict
in
the
testimony
of
the
three
doctors
on
that
commission
in
their
depositions.
he
find
such
conflict
from
the
statement
of
one
of
the
doctors,
dr.
richards,
that
in
his
judgment,
jesse
blackburn
did
not
show
--
was
at
all
times
normal.
and
that
is
the
statement
of
dr.
richards,
that
in
his
judgement,
jesse
blackburn
was
at
all
times
normal.
on
the
same
deposition,
however,
dr.
richards
stated
--
reaffirmed
the
position
he'd
taken
in
his
report
that
jesse
blackburn
was
insane
when
he
first
examined
him,
was
insane
when
the
crime
was
committed.
and
i
think
the
only
logical
way
to
square
dr.
richards'
testimony
not
with
the
testimony
of
the
other
doctors,
but
with
his
other
testimony
on
that
deposition
was
that
he
viewed
jesse
blackburn's
normal
condition
as
that
of
insane.
this
is
strengthened
when
it
is
also
noted
that
dr.
richards
was
asked,
does
--
did
you
ever
observe
jesse
blackburn
when
he
was
having
a
lucid
interval?
and
he
said
that
in
his
judgment
jesse
blackburn
had
no
lucid
intervals.
respondent
makes
a
further
effort
to
minimize
the
report
of
the
sanity
commission
by
suggesting
that
dr.
rowe,
one
of
the
other
doctors
that
examined
him,
conceded
that
he
didn't
see
him
too
often
or
words
to
that
effect
that
he
saw
him
on
his
general
rounds.
but
what
dr.
rowe
said
was,
and
i'm
quoting
that
he
had
petitioner
“continuously
under
observation
from
the
time
of
his
admission
to
the
hospital
until
his
discharge.”
he
stated
that
on
many
occasions,
he
interviewed
jesse
blackburn
for
quite
sometime,
for
interviews
that
lasted
more
than
an
hour
in
duration
and
in
on
other
times,
he
just
saw
him
on
his
general
ward
rounds.
on
the
basis
of
this
lunacy
commission's
report,
jesse
blackburn
was
committed
to
the
insane
hospitals
in
alabama
and
he
remained
on
an
insane
institution
from
july
1948
until
november
1952.
he
was
actually
in
the
insane
hospital
for
more
than
four
years
being
treated
for
his
insanity.
that
was
under
an
order
of
the
circuit
court
of
colbert
county
which
directed
that
he
be
turned
over
to
the
insane
hospital
“permanently"
or
until
restored
to
sanity.
in
1952,
the
sanity
commission
reported
back
to
the
court
that
at
that
time,
jesse
appeared
to
be
restored
to
sanity.
and
then
he
was
brought
back
and
put
to
trial.
now,
the
state
of
alabama
recognized
the
time
honored
rule
that
you
don't
try
insane
people.
and
for
that
reason,
they
put
jesse
blackburn
where
he
belong
in
an
insane
institution
for
some
four-and-a-half
years.
but
when
they
said
he
was
restored
to
sanity,
they
sent
him
back
to
trial
and
convicted
him
on
a
confession,
which
in
the
opinion
of
all
the
medical
evidence
in
the
case,
was
obtained
at
a
time
when
he
was
insane.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
the
jury
passed
on
the
question
of
whether
he
was
insane
at
the
time
the
offense
was
committed.
in
alabama,
the
court
passes
on
the
matter
of
--
of
whether
the
confession
was
voluntarily
or
involuntarily.
the
court
ruled
that
it
was
voluntary
despite
the
fact
that
all
the
medical
testimony,
these
depositions
of
the
doctors
that
had
the
lunacy
report,
and
all
of
this,
it
ruled
that
it
was
voluntary.
then
the
confession
was
admitted
in
evidence
and
it
went
to
the
jury
under
instructions
which
said
that
there
was
a
claim
of
insanity
in
the
case
and
then
unless
they
--
they
could
give
whatever
weight
they
desired
to
the
confession.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes,
sir.
i
--
i
don't
think
it
was
appropriately
considered,
it
was
--
it
was
considered.
we
think
that
surely
if
the
law
protects
a
defendant
from
standing
trial
when
he
is
insane,
at
which
time
he,
in
a
capital
case
such
as
this,
he
would
be
protected
by
the
court
and
protected
by
court
appointed
counsel
that
due
process
extends
to
a
confession
which
was
obtained
at
a
time
when
he
was
mentally
insane.
now,
if
this
confession
was
not
obtained
at
a
time
when
petitioner
was
insane,
we
submit
this
court
will
never
have
an
opportunity
to
pass
on
a
case
where
such
is
the
situation
because
the
only
evidence
in
this
case
that
petitioner
was
otherwise
than
a
mentally
deranged
person.
all
of
his
medical
history
showed
his
mentally
derangement.
his
four-and-a-half
years
incarceration
for
mental
disorder
after
his
confession
shows
it.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes,
sir.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
oh,
better
than
four
years,
merely
five
years.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
that's
correct,
sir,
because
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
in
that
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
no,
sir.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
there
was
the
testimony
of
the
three
doctors,
their
depositions,
the
members
of
sanity
commission
and
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes,
sir.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes,
sir.
and
there
was
also
the
--
his
records
from
the
veterans
administration
which
showed
that
he
had
been
surveyed
out
in
the
army
as
a
mentally
--
mental
defective
and
he'd
spent
the
prior
four
years
in
a
government
insane
hospital
as
100%
mentally
defective
patient.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes,
sir.
the
only
testimony
to
repute
it
came
from
the
deputy
sheriff
who
had
taken
the
confession,
who
said
that
in
his
judgement,
the
petitioner
made
sensible
answers
to
questions
that
his
eyes
were
clear
and
that
he
could
answer
questions
with
clarity
and
seemed
to
know
the
details
about
the
instance
--
incidents
that
he
was
being
questioned
about.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
says
that
at
that
point,
the
judge
must
pronounce
whether
the
confession
was
voluntary.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
you
mean
at
the
time
of
the
confession?
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
i
don't
know
whether
--
whether
it
could
be
classified
as
finding
of
fact
that
he
was
sane.
he
makes
a
finding
of
fact
that
it
was
voluntary
which
is
implicit
and
he
is
admitting
it
in
the
evidence.
and
then
after
his
--
after
the
ruling
on
voir
dire
and
after
the
confession
had
been
admitted
in
the
evidence,
when
the
defendant
took
the
stand
in
his
part
of
the
case,
he
stated
to
the
court
that
the
signature
appeared
to
be
his,
he
had
no
recollection
of
anything.
recited
in
the
confession
that
he
had
no
recollection
of
events
leading
up
to
his
trip
to
alabama
and
he
--
he
didn't
remember
anything
for
several
months
after
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
i'm
--
i'm
pretty
sure
that's
correct,
judge
hill.
now,
we
think
that
whatever
the
standard
for
judging
whether
this
confession
was
voluntary,
the
circuit
judge
in
alabama
applied
that
it
wasn't
--
the
stand,
that
it
is
not
approved
by
this
court.
in
the
appellate
court,
the
court
of
appeals,
which
was
the
only
the
court
that
brought
an
opinion
addressed
to
this,
the
court
of
appeals
simply
said
that
the
--
in
matters
of
this
kind,
the
discretion
vested
in
the
trial
judge
is
so
broad
that
it
would
not
upset
the
trial
court's
judgement
as
to
this
question
of
whether
the
confession
was
voluntary.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
i
--
i
believe
the
state
would
concede
probably
that
it
could
not,
although
the
--
the
trial
judge
said
in
its
--
in
its
oral
charge
that
in
the
event
the
jury
didn't
wish
to
consider
the
confession,
they
could
consider
the
circumstantial
evidence
and
so
forth.
but
the
only
circumstantial
evidence
in
the
case
really
was
that
jesse
blackburn
was
down
there
with
two
other
colored
men
driving
--
one
of
the
other
colored
man
had
a
--
a
maroon
buick
and
with
an
illinois
license
tag
and
there
was
evidence
that
the
robbery
was
committed
by
persons
driving
a
maroon
buick
with
an
illinois
licence
tag,
but
there
was
no
evidence
that
jesse
blackburn
was
even
at
the
scene
of
this
crime.
and
i
think
it
is
--
the
only
fair
conclusion
would
be
that
without
this
confession
there
couldn't
have
been
any
conviction.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
no,
sir,
i
would
not.
i
think
this
court
has
stated
in
many,
many
cases
that
if
the
confession
comes
in,
that
--
that
that
ends
it,
he's
got
to
go
back
for
another
trial.
now,
the
test
announced
by
this
court
and
not
for
the
first
time
either
but
announced
by
this
court
in
the
stein
case
was
--
where
this
court
allowed
a
confession,
"the
limits
of
constitutional
due
process
in
any
case
depends
upon
a
weighing
of
circumstances
of
pressure
against
the
power
of
resistance
to
the
person
confessing.
what
would
be
overpowering
to
the
weak
of
will
or
mind
might
be
utterly
ineffective
against
an
experienced
criminal."
now,
what
were
the
powers
of
resistance
of
this
mentally
deranged
man
who,
at
the
time
of
his
trial,
had
spent
his
entire
adult
life
over
eight
years
in
insane
institutions?
the
stein
case
emphasized
that
the
prisoners
in
that
case
were
not,
“young,
soft,
ignorant
or
timid.
they
were
not
inexperienced
in
the
ways
of
crime
or
its
detection."
apply
the
plain
implication
of
that
language
to
jesse
blackburn,
he
is
a
man
that
has
never
had
any
previous
experience
whatsoever
with
criminal
procedures.
he
was
25
years
old
when
this
crime
was
committed
and
when
this
confession
was
taken
and
he'd
spent
all
of
his
adult
life
at
that
time
in
an
insane
institution.
plain
implication
of
stein
if
it
means
anything
in
that
regard,
we
submit,
is
that
the
circumstances
of
pressure
brought
against
him
was
overpowering
to
him
because
his
powers
of
resistance
was
so
weak.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
you
mean
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals?
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
well,
the
only
thing
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
to
me,
it
is.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes,
sir.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
i
think
it's
a
fair
question
and
i'll
try
to
answer
it.
i
think
to
begin
with
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes,
sir.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
no,
sir.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes,
sir.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
well,
i
would
suggest
this,
your
honor,
that
in
reading
the
courts
of
opinions,
the
courts
of
alabama,
appellate
courts
in
confession
cases,
you
find
almost
no
cases
where
the
confession
--
where
a
case
has
been
thrown
out.
a
conviction
has
been
reversed
because
the
confession
was
admitted
in
evidence.
i
don't
purport
to
have
exhausted
those
reports.
but
in
my
research
of
it,
i
found
only
one
case
which
was
many,
many
years
ago
where
the
courts
of
alabama
knocked
out
a
case
on
the
ground
of
--
of
the
confessions
being
involuntary.
and
i
think
the
key
to
--
the
key
to
--
to
answering
your
question
is
probably
found
in
the
--
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
where
it
says
that
we
vest
so
much
discretion
in
the
trial
judge
in
these
matters
that
we
will
not
upset
his
judgment.
they
view
it
somewhat
as
a
judgement
of
fact,
although
this
court
has
said,
your
honor
has
said
in
--
in
some
of
his
opinions
that
--
that
these
are
questions
of
fact
but
they're
the
very
facts
that
this
court
is
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
well,
if
you're
asking
me
how
to
explain
the
jury's
verdict
in
this
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
i'd
be
happy
to
try.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes,
sir.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes,
sir.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes,
sir.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
that's
--
i
would
say
this
in
--
in
defense
of
the
jury
down
there
not
that
i
--
no,
there's
nothing
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
i
know
it
--
i
know
it.
i
recognize
that.
but
i
would
put
out
this
to
the
court
that
the
jury
was
at
somewhat
of
a
disadvantage
in
this
case.
they
were
suppose
to
pass
on
the
insanity
of
--
of
a
prisoner
who,
under
the
test
which
the
state
is
now
attacking,
caused
his
commission
to
the
alabama
insane
hospital
for
treatment
for
some
four-and-a-half
years.
and
at
the
time
the
jury
viewed
him,
he,
according
to
that
commission,
had
been
restored
to
sanity.
he
took
the
stand
and
was
apparently
able
to
answer
questions
and
the
question
was
brought
out
that
at
that
time
he
had
been
and
jury
was
so
advised
that
he
had
been
restored
to
sanity.
so
the
jury
was
--
it's
ironic
but
perhaps
if
jesse
blackburn
had
not
been
quite
so
much
mentally
deranged,
so
that
it
was
apparent
to
everybody
that
examined
him,
immediately
including
his
jailor,
he
might
have
taken
the
stand
there
and
even
the
jury
might
have
seen
at
the
time
that
his
trial
would
normally
have
come
up
that
he
was
a
demented
individual.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
i
don't
know,
sir.
i
--
i
think
it
--
i'm
sure
it
lasted
more
than
one
day.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes,
sir.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
that's
all
it
could
have
been.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
i'm
--
i
have
asked
such
question
myself,
what
the
lunatic
doing
lunacy
unless
it
means
that
he's
got
to
be
more
or
less,
i
don't
mean
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
insane
when
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
--
when
he
stood
trial
or
when
he
--
when
he
--
when
the
confession
was
taken.
that
redwine
case,
which
is
one
that
they're
referring
to
there,
in
that
case,
the
man
on
voir
dire
offered
to
make
a
showing
that
the
--
that
redwine,
the
defendant,
was
insane
and
the
court
didn't
permit
it.
and
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
ruled
that
that
was
not
reversible
error
because
the
quest
--
the
offer
should
have
been
phrased
in
terms
not
that
he
was
insane,
but
that
he
was
a
lunatic
in
lunacy.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes,
sir.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes,
sir.
i
think
--
i
think
the
standard
that
although
they
say
here
that
--
in
--
at
the
bottom
of
page
246,
when
they're
talking
about
the
accused
not
being
in
full
possession
of
his
faculties,
they
do
say,
although
that
is
a
circumstance
to
be
considered
by
the
--
by
the
jury,
weighing
its
verity.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
i
think
it
does.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
i
was
going
to
say
if
that
meant
what
i
believe
it
doesn't
mean,
if
the
court
--
i
think
what
the
--
what
the
courts
of
alabama
do
in
these
instances
is
to
compartmentalize
the
two.
they
say,
was
there
any
brutality,
was
the
interrogation
beyond
the
allowable
limits,
then
that's
one
compartment.
then
was
he
a
lunatic
in
lunacy?
if
you
answer
--
they
don't
consider
the
two
in
conjunction
which
is,
as
i
understand
it,
is
exactly
the
--
the
direction
of
this
court
in
the
stein
case,
in
the
fikes
case,
in
the
haley
against
state
of
ohio
case.
in
the
haley
case,
you
remember,
there
--
there
was
a
young
boy,
i
think
he
was
15
years
of
age
and
was
picked
up
and
carried
to
jail
and
was
interrogated
for
some
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
i
think
this
case
is
much
stronger
than
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes,
sir,
in
my
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
in
my
judgment,
the
confession
from
a
person
who
is
mentally
deranged,
insane
is
and
should
be
per
se,
inadmissible.
again
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
but
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
no,
no,
sir.
i
--
i
don't
want
to
stand
only
on
that
ground
because
so
far
as
i
know
this
court
hasn't
had
to
consider
just
that
issue,
but
this
court
has
considered
the
question
where
you
have
mental
derangement.
although
it
--
certainly,
none
of
those
cases
has
gone
to
the
extent
that
it
has
gone
here.
but
this
court
has
considered
mental
derangement
plus
--
plus
prolonged
questioning.
and
i
stand
in
the
final
analysis
on
the
combination
of
those
two
things,
he
has
nine
or
ten
hours
of
sustained
questioning
plus
a
person
who
is
already
a
--
a
mentally
deranged
person
and
there
--
there
couldn't
possibly
be
any
argument
that
this
man
was
mentally
deranged
at
the
time
of
his
confession.
surely,
that
the
statement
of
the
deputy
sheriff
that
his
eyes
were
clear
and
so
forth,
we
know
enough
about
insanity
to
know
it
is
not
generally
detected
or
not
often
detected
by
a
layman
schizophrenia
and
so
forth.
and
in
that
connection,
i
think,
i
might
point
out
just
--
in
just
a
word,
something
of
a
nature
of
this
disease
of
schizophrenia.
gray's,
in
his
textbook,
medical
textbook
for
attorneys
in
volume
1
says,
if
the
victim
of
even
simple
schizophrenia
is
driven,
the
patient
breaks
down.
so
getting
back
to
the
test
in
this
court
which
is
weighing
the
power
of
resistance
against
pressure
brought,
you
have
a
mental
disease
here
which
is
a
characteristic
of
it
is
that
under
pressure
you
breakdown.
smooth
in
his
text
on
criminal
insanity
says
that
schizophrenics
are
held
not
to
be
able
to
act
rationally
in
their
relations
with
other
members
of
society
and
are
easily
imposed
from
it.
and
in
connection
with
the
statement
of
the
deputy
sheriff
that
he
looked
sane,
gray
states,
should
the
patient
apparently
recover
from
schizophrenia,
stoppage
of
progress
is
all
that
occurs
with
residual
changes
permanent
in
character.
so
we
think
that
in
this
case
that
it
is
closely
analogous
to
the
fikes
case
which
this
court
has
recently
decided
with
the
exception
that
the
most
--
two
of
the
two
most
significant
circumstances
in
the
fikes
case
present
here
to
a
much
greater
extent,
the
court
in
the
fikes
case
commented
on
the
mental
instability
of
the
prisoner
in
that
case.
here,
we've
got
a
history
of
mental
insanity
--
insanity
to
the
point
of
incarceration
for
some
eight-and-a-half
years.
and
in
the
fikes
case
there
was
a
questioning
which
never
at
any
period,
i
think
lasted
for
--
a
sustained
period,
lasted
more
than
two
or
three
hours.
in
this
case,
according
to
the
deputy
sheriff,
it
lasted
for
nine
hours
with
one
break.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
they
were
not,
except
by
the
testimony
of
the
deputy
sheriff
that
he
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
i
would
certainly
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
well,
the
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
correct.
the
only
adjudication
of
sanity
that
jesse
blackburn
has
ever
had
was
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
--
was
at
the
hands
of
this
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
--
this
jury.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
i
--
i
think
that
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
and
--
and
the
state
would
have
been
in
an
anomalous
position
to
have
challenged
it
when
it
acted
on
that
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
--
report
to
send
this
man
off
for
four-and-a-half
years.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
i
think
--
i
think
that
is
a
logical
position
to
take.
i
think
it's
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
but
we
--
we
have
here
circumstances
over
and
beyond
the
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
--
finding
and
i
didn't
want
to
stand
anywhere
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
--
on
any
intermediate
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
i
--
i
think
carrying
out
your
honor's
thought
on
that
if
this
--
this
is
not
merely
a
situation
where
the
defendant
comes
in
with
an
expert
psychiatrist
who
says
this
man
in
his
judgment
is
mentally
insane.
this
is
--
is
--
it
--
it's
somewhat
in
the
nature
of
a
bargain,
a
bargain
that
--
that
the
state
makes
with
the
defendants.
and
they
are
committed
to
this
sanity
commission
and
the
sanity
commission
if
it
had
come
out
with
--
with
a
finding
of
sanity,
it
would
have
been
powerfully
persuasive,
if
not,
conclusive.
and
it
wouldn't
have
been
conclusive
but
it
would
have
been
powerful
persuasive
on
--
on
the
court,
the
jury,
and
everyone
else
at
the
time
of
this
trial
that
this
man
was
sane.
but
the
state
got
an
adverse
ruling
from
its
own
--
own
doctors.
every
one
of
these
are
state
doctors
in
the
state
mental
hospitals
and
all
of
them
said
he
was
insane.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
the
--
the
decision
of
the
sanity
commission
itself
which
was
reported
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
--
back
to
the
court
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
well,
i
think
--
i
think
that
is
correct
with
this
exception
to
it,
that
the
--
that
the
report
of
the
sanity
commission
went
beyond,
the
report
to
the
judge
went
beyond
a
mere
finding.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
i
--
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
committing
him
to
the
insane
institution
would
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
i
was
agreeing
with
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
i
was
attempting
to
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
i
was
tempted
to
agree
with
the
court
that
his
commission
to
the
insane
institution
would
go
no
further
than
the
finding
that
he
was
insane
at
the
time
he
was
being
examined
by
the
commission.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
no,
sir.
the
confession
was
made
on
may
the
8th
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
--
and
some
time
after
the
confession
was
made,
the
deputy
sheriff
or
the
sheriff
reported
to
the
judge
that
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
it's
not
clear,
he
said
it
--
but
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
well
--
well,
it
--
the
--
the
confession
was
may
8.
he
was
--
the
--
the
order
of
the
judge
sent
him
to
the
sanity
commission
which
was
after
local
doctors
that
examined
him
and
other
people
and
so
forth
was
in
july.
so
it
had
to
be
within
a
relatively
short
period
of
time,
but
it
--
it
may
not
have
been
--
i
think
the
deputy
said
it
wasn't
immediately
or
that
it
was
some
time
thereafter.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
well,
by
the
court
itself,
i
would
say
no.
the
sanity
commission
which
was
what
i
understood
justice
frankfurter
was
talking
about
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
that's
right.
the
--
the
sanity
commission
made
a
finding
to
the
court
that
he
was
insane,
not
only
when
they
examined
him
but
in
their
judgment,
was
insane
when
the
crime
was
committed
and
was
insane
when
the
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes,
sir.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
in
--
in
conclusion
and
i'd
like
to
save
some
--
some
time
for
rebuttal
in
case
it's
needed.
i'd
just
like
to
say
that
in
our
opinion
this
is
the
type
of
miscarriage
of
justice
that
justice
jackson,
the
late
justice
jackson
spoke
of
in
the
stein
case
as
being
so
grave
that
it
requires
in
a
--
in
a
civilized
society
with
an
enlightened
system
of
justice
that
the
reverse
shall
be
thrown
out.
this
was
nothing
more
than
a
conviction
of
an
insane
person
on
the
basis
of
a
confession
which
was
taken
from
him
after
some
nine
or
ten
hours
of
questioning
in
a
room
four
by
six
or
six
by
eight,
by
relays
of
law
enforcement
officers
at
a
time
when
all
the
medical
opinion,
not
merely
the
sanity
commission
but
everybody
who
has
ever
examined
him,
had
found
that
he
was
mentally
in
--
and
100%
mentally
incompetent.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
thank
you.
i
just
want
to
take
a
minute
or
two,
your
honor,
to
point
out
that
if
this
petitioner
was
not
insane
at
the
time
of
his
confession,
it's
difficult
to
see
how
on
any
state
of
evidence
there
could
be
such
a
finding
by
any
court.
the
only
evidence
presented
by
the
state
of
alabama
that
this
man
was
not
insane,
despite
the
reports
of
the
numerous
doctors
who
examined
him,
the
veterans
administration
and
then
the
government
insane
hospital
plus
the
state
of
alabama's
doctors
convened
pursuant
to
the
court's
order,
all
found
him
insane.
the
only
evidence
to
the
contrary
was
the
statement
by
the
man
who
took
his
confession.
now
obviously,
the
man
who
took
his
confession
in
no
case
is
going
to
come
in
and
say,
well,
he
probably
was
insane
at
the
time
but
it's
--
that's
the
same
deputy
sheriff
that
some
short
time
thereafter
did
admit
that
he
observed
signs
of
insanity.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
that's
the
only
time
he's
ever
been
found
sane.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
i
suppose
--
i
don't
know
that
there
was
a
finding
of
the
sanity
commission
whether
there'd
be
an
adjudication
or
not.
it
would
be
a
loose
use
of
the
word
“adjudicate”.
there
was
that
finding
by
the
sanity
commission.
but
as
to
this
question
of
the
conflict
and
i'm
about
to
sit
down,
i
know
my
time
is
nearly
up.
the
--
on
page
226
of
the
record,
this
dr.
richards
says
the
state
of
alabama
relies
on
for
having
a
conflicting
opinion
about
jesse
blackburn's
insanity,
was
asked
a
question,
“is
it
not
a
fact,
dr.
richards,
from
your
observation
of
jesse
blackburn
that
he
at
times
had
lucid
intervals?
the
answer
-
"i
do
not
think
so."
that's
the
same
doctor
who
said
he
was
insane
on
all
the
occasions
that
the
other
doctor
said
he
was.
and
may
i
point
out
that
in
the
cases
of
haley,
in
the
case
of
fikes,
in
the
case
of
stein,
there's
no
requirement
in
order
to
find
that
the
confession
be
determined
as
involuntary
that
the
man
have
to
be
insane.
and
i
think
this
record
adequately
supports
the
conclusion
that
he
was
insane
and
really
no
other
conclusion
as
it
seems
to
me
to
be
possible
but
this
court
does
not
require
insanity.
it
only
requires
that
the
pressures
brought
to
bear
be
greater
than
the
power
of
the
--
of
resistance
of
the
party
who
is
being
interrogated.
and
there
isn't
any
dispute
that
this
man
had
spent
his
entire
adult
life
in
an
insane
hospital
and
that
he'd
been
--
he
had
been
found
insane
by
everybody
who
had
ever
examined
him
with
medical
competence
to
examine.
the
state
of
alabama
introduced
no
evidence
any
way
in
his
trial,
despite
the
findings
of
its
own
three
doctors
that
he
was
insane.
they
could
have
him
examined
by
somebody
else
if
they
had
any
doubt
about
the
correctness
of
those
findings
but
there
was
no
medical
testimony
to
the
contrary.
they
simplify
found
this,
submitted
it
to
the
jury
and
then
said
that
so
much
discretion
is
in
the
trial
court
and
there's
a
finding
of
fact
and
so
this
board
goes
off
for
20
years.
thank
you.
