justice

frankfurter
mr.
hobbs,
i
probably
missed
it.
what
was
the
time
between
the
confessions
--
confession,
which
is
what
you
bring
here
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
the
trial,
what
period?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
didn't
come
to
trial
for
five
years
after
the
confession?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
yes,
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
at
the
trial
--
at
the
trial
the
claim
of
insanity
was
--
was
stressed,
held
first.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
--
was
it
claimed
at
the
trial
that
he
was
insane,
not
when
he
made
the
--
when
he
gave
the
so-called
confession,
but
at
the
trial,
was
he
--
was
it
claimed
that
he
was
too
insane
at
the
time
to
stand
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
okay.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
wouldn't
concede
that
that
would
make
a
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
hobbs,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
a
question
and
--
and
i'm
fumbling
for
words
to
avoid
misunderstanding.
to
you
this
decision
seems
to
me
utterly
in
defensive
of
nothing,
that's
your
word,
do
you
think
there's
nothing
to
justify
it,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
think
this
is
a
perfectly
clear
case,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
to
you
it's
perfectly
clear
within
our
decisions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
now,
when
i
say
i'm
trying
to
struggle
with
words
i
can
use.
i
do
not
remotely
mean
you
to
do
any
psychoanalysis
of
the
judges
who
decided
otherwise.
i
mean
you
to
take
the
opinion
and
try
to
--
in
your
capacity
to
indicate
if
you
can,
if
you
say
--
prefer
not
to
answer
the
question,
i
would
understand
it
too
but
it
bothers
me
and
that's
why
i'm
putting
the
--
but
rather
it
seems
--
seems
as
clear
that
seems
to
be
--
or
i
ask
myself
how
did
the
conscientious
court
--
what
were
the
assumption?
what
were
the
presuppositions?
how
did
they
off
to
legal
way
as
much
as
your
argument
indicates
that
in
your
view
it
did,
would
you
care
to
answer
that
question,
mr.
hobbs?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
assuming
that
one
assumption
in
my
question.
that
court
is
conscientious?
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
read
the
opinion
to
the
court,
did
you
argue
this
case
below?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
all
there
is
--
the
reports
of
this
court
are
not
recondite,
the
very
things
locked
up
in
some
treasure
room
of
the
library.
they're
familiar
with
them
and
did
the
best
to
apply
those.
that's
the
assumption
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i'm
making.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
jury's
share
in
this
determination
in
alabama?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
asking
you
to
explain
why
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
i
don't
mean
that.
i
mean
is
there
--
and
i
was
wondering
whether
you
give
an
answer
along
the
line
as
you
did,
is
there
that
they
say
--
the
jury
also
is
a
party
to
this
determination
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
it
isn't
merely
the
trial
court
but
it's
your
appellate
court,
your
suggestion
is
that
they
regard
this
as
in
the
manner
of
--
in
the
way
and
fairly
enough,
it
can
be
said
to
be
a
question
of
--
of
the
fact,
the
ascertainment
of
a
condition,
that's
what
they
say,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
that's
been
--
and
their
ascertainment
has
been
made
or
the
determination
has
been
made
by
a
trial
judge
who
then
adequately,
well
assume,
i
assume
charges
the
jury,
charges
them
with
their
responsibility
and
their
opportunity
to
pass
on
what
are
complicated
facts.
that's
the
explanation.
the
respect
show
no
deference
or
regard
for
it,
if
you
will,
the
jury
plus
the
judge
in
passing
on
what
they
concede
to
be
a
question
of
fact,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
that's
the
language
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
--
how
many
hours,
if
it
was
hours,
was
he
before
the
trial
jury
in
the
main
case,
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
did?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
they
had
a
good
look
at
him
and
from
that
they
judged
what
he
was
like
four
years
before,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
hobbs,
did
you
tell
the
court
whether
the
--
at
the
trial,
at
his
trial,
the
findings
of
the
commission
of
lunacy
were
challenged?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
i
mean
findings
of
the
commission,
as
a
--
they
have
all
sorts
of
--
or
does
it
have
legal
significance
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
consequences?
within
the
state
of
alabama,
would
--
has
that
any
legal
meaning?
what
does
it
mean
if
the
finding
of
the
commission
of
lunacy
in
the
circuit
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
point
of
making
a
finding,
i
know
it's
partly
a
requirement
that
he
should
be
capable
of
being
committed.
but
that
in
itself
is
in
a
--
is
hesitating
into
an
adjudication,
but
it
is
a
determination
within
the
court
of
the
circumstance
that
has
lots
of
legal
consequences,
i
should
think.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
might
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
come
up
in
a
perfectly,
if
he
ordered
a
lot
of
grocery
and
he
pay
for
them,
it
might
--
you
might
depend
on
this
going
contract
of
this
order.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
--
that
finding
was
not
challenged
at
the
main
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
--
at
this
another
question
i
ought
to
get
put.
why
are
you
not
urging
the
court,
why
are
you
not
standing
on
the
legal
proposition
that
is
in
fact
there
has
been
what
within
its
scope
is
an
adjudication
of
insanity
that
in
and
of
itself
precludes
use
of
statements,
inculpatory
statements
made
during
--
the
state
which
that
determination
has
made
knowing
the
condition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
is
the
point
--
you
said
slightly
put.
i
don't
see
how
the
--
what
the
--
what
the
bearing
of
the
jury's
finding
is
on
that
which
has
already
been
found
by
a
body
that
contemporaneously
was
acting
on
the
issue
in
reaching
its
determination
on
which
this
data
has
acted
which
wasn't
upset
or
questioned.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
didn't
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
why
isn't
that
a
legal
proposition
or
a
legal
consideration
that
doesn't
bring
the
case
within
the
natural,
from
my
point
of
view,
reason,
on
the
whole
reasonable
statement,
there's
a
jury
determination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
put
my
question
to
you
in
the
expectation
that
when
the
attorney
general
comes
to
reply,
he
will
deal
with
it
because
it
seems
to
me
of
--
of
great
importance.
and
the
kind
of
the
thing,
so
far
as
i
recall
that
we've
not
had
in
a
single
case
that's
been
before
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
wasn't
the
confession
made
during
the
period,
during
which
that
--
that
commitment
lasted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
soon
thereafter?
justice
felix
frankfurter
two
months
or
two
days
or
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
basis
of
which
the
court
acted.
