justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
hobbs,
at
the
hearing
before
the
judge
on
the
issue
of
inadmissibility
of
the
confessions
by
reason
of
insanity
when
taken,
what
testimony
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
are
the
ones
who
made
the
finding
that
he
was
in
fact
insane
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
when
the
question
was
taken?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
testimony
was,
therefore,
that
reputes
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
under
your
practice
did
the
judge
then
have
to
make
a
finding
of
fact?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
on
the
issue
inadmissible
by
reason
of
insanity
at
the
time,
does
the
judge
make
a
finding
of
fact?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
when
it's
offered,
does
he
say
that
i
find
as
a
fact
he
was
sane
when
it
was
taken
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
is
not
important
and
i'm
just
curious.
was
the
trial
judge
the
same
one
who
had
originally
committed
him
for
examination?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
hobbs,
may
i
--
i'm
just
looking
at
this
alabama
appellate
court
opinion.
i
see
at
247
and
there's
some
reference
to
a
standard
in
cases
where
this
issue
was
urged
as
a
reason
for
inadmissibility
followed
by
the
alabama
courts,
but
i
don't
quite
understand
what
it
means.
according
to
this
and
these
quotes
from
some
alabama
opinions,
"is
to
be
observed
that
the
voluntariness
of
a
confession
is
not
affected
by
the
fact
that
the
accused
was
not
in
full
possession
of
faculties."
and
that
goes
on,
"to
render
such
confession
inadmissible
on
that
ground
alone.
the
mania
must
have
been
such
that
the
accused
was
either
an
idiot
or
a
lunatic
during
lunacy."
what's
that
mean?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
insane
when
he
stands
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
take
it
then
when
the
following
paragraph,
we
conclude
the
wide
discretion,
that's
the
one
you
referred
to
as
--
is
in
the
trial
judge
on
these
issues
of
admissibility
of
confession.
the
wide
discretion
vested
in
the
court
is
not
shown
here
to
have
been
abused
and
there
was
no
error
in
admitting
the
confession
in
evidence,
has
to
be
read
in
light
of
the
standard
which
was
employed,
does
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
attacking
the
standard
as
such?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
means
it's
verity
as
to
the
contents,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
after
it's
admitted?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
none
of
those
cases
involved
a
case
such
as
this
of
an
actual
finding
--
determination
of
insanity
at
the
time
that
the
confession
was
taken,
i
think,
is
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is,
are
you
attacking
this
on
the
due
process
grounds
as
that
if
he
were
that
insane
and
this
--
assuming
the
evidence
supports
it
and
that
there
isn't
anything
to
question
the
finding,
any
finding,
except
that
he
was
so
insane
as
that
necessarily
his
act
was
involuntary.
are
you
attacking
this
on
the
ground
that
being
involuntary
couldn't
possibly
ever
it
be
voluntary
and
therefore
to
have
used
it
at
all,
or
admitted
it
at
all
was
a
deniable
of
due
process?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
has
nothing
to
do
then
with
the
circumstances
under
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
which
it's
taken.
