doctor
that

it
--
it
says
this,
did
you
and
the
other
doctors
associated
with
you
find
as
stated
in
said
report,
“from
a
copy
of
his
case
and
using
information
from
several
other
mental
hospitals
where
he
has
formerly
been
treated,
it
is
our
further
opinion
that
he
was
insane
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
crime
for
which
he
is
charged.”
did
this
part
of
your
report
relate
to
jesse
blackburn
and
to
the
indictments
of
robbery
and
assault
with
the
intent
to
commit
murder
which
had
been
returned
and
were
pending
against
him
in
colbert
county,
alabama
at
the
time
of
your
said
report?
answering
the
fifth
direct
interrogatory
the
witness
says,
yes,
the
other
doctors
and
i
have
found
as
stated
in
said
report
that,
“from
a
study
of
his
case
and
using
information
from
several
other
mental
hospitals
where
he
has
formerly
been
treated,
it
is
our
further
opinion
that
he
was
insane
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
crime
for
which
he
is
charged."
yes,
that
part
of
our
report
related
to
jesse
blackburn
and
to
the
indictments
and
so
forth.
yes,
i
have
read
that
report.
yes,
i
had
signed
it.
yes,
i
and
the
said
other
doctors
associated
with
me
found
stated
in
--
in
said
report.
and
that
part
of
said
report
which
is
set
out,
“commencing
with
the
words.”
so
in
general
i
take
it
he
did
agree
with
the
other
two
doctors,
did
he
not?

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gish,
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
perhaps,
it
will
bear
on
the
decision
but
in
the
absence
of
this
confession,
is
there
enough
in
the
record
to
sustain
the
conviction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hobbs,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
