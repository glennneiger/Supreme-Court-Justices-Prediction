justice
charles
e.
whittaker
excuse
me.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
would
you
rely
on,
mr.
hobbs,
as
the
act
of
adjudication
of
insanity
here?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
that
as
i
understand,
the
--
when
this
accused
came
on
for
trial
before
the
court,
a
question
arose
as
to
whether
or
not
he
was
at
that
time
mentally
competent
to
stand
trial.
and
for
the
purpose
of
determining
that
issue,
the
court
had
him
examined.
and
reports
were
made
to
the
court
on
the
basis
of
which
the
court
did
not
adjudicate
him
insane.
what
found
that
for
the
time
being
he
is
not
mentally
competent
to
stand
trial?
do
i
misunderstand
it?
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
but
there
was
no
finding
by
the
court
of
anything
more
than
that
at
the
moment
the
accused
is
not
able
to
stand
trial
is
as
i
understand
it,
am
i
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
of
course,
he
must
commit
him
under
your
law
on
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
until
he's
able
to
stand
trial.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
is
it
your
view
that
that
amounts
to
an
adjudication
of
sanity
--
of
insanity?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
i
was
trying
to
see
if
there
is
a
basis
that
could
amount
to
an
adjudication
of
insanity
which
would
raise
the
question
sharply,
suggested
by
my
brother
frankfurter,
on
the
question
of
the
law
as
to
whether,
if
there
is
an
adjudication
of
insanity,
the
confession
wouldn't
automatically
fall?
but
is
there
any
such
adjudication
in
this
case?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
--
you
use
that
word
finding
in
that
sense
i
assume
in
the
sense
of
conclusion.
the
--
the
commission
made
a
--
they
reached
a
conclusion.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
