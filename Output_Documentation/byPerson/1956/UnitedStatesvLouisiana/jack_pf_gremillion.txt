mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
mr.
justice
black
and
your
honors.
as
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
louisiana,
i
would
like
to
briefly
explain
to
the
court
the
position
of
the
state
in
this
case.
incidentally,
this
is
an
auspicious
day
for
louisiana
because
were
admitted
to
the
union
of
145
--
145
years
ago
today.
so,
we
are
here
in
a
form
of
a
happy
birthday,
and
we
hope
it
will
be
happy.
our
position
is
plain
and
it's
covered
in
several
simple
statements,
which
i
would
like
to
make
to
the
court.
our
argument
will
be
conducted
on
the
motion
about
--
the
argument
of
louisiana
on
the
motion
against
the
federal
government
would
be
conducted
by
mr.
scott
wilkinson
of
shreveport
and
mr.
victor
sachse
of
baton
rouge
will
conclude
the
state's
argument
under
the
arrangement
that
we
have
made.
but
i
want
to
state
our
position
very
simply
at
the
outset
and
that
is
this.
that,
number
one,
the
seaward
boundaries
of
our
state
are
coextensive
with
the
seaward
boundaries
of
the
nation.
there
is
not
any
federally-owned
belt
of
submerged
land
seaward
of
the
state-owned
submerged
land.
and
while
the
congress
alone
can
declare
the
extent
of
american
territory,
and
has
done
so,
the
ownership
of
that
territory,
as
distinguished
from
the
imperium
respecting
it,
necessarily
is
vested
in
the
states
pursuant
to
our
constitutional
system.
and
number
two,
alternatively,
and
only
if
the
court
should
hold
that
congress
can
legally
appropriate
for
the
federal
government
a
belt
of
land
seaward
of
the
submerged
land
belonging
to
and
occupied
by
the
states.
louisiana
claims
that
its
historic
boundaries
within
the
meaning
of
congressional
acts
extend
seaward
three
leagues
and
not
just
three
miles
from
its
coast.
third,
if
a
state
limit
is
set
short
of
the
limit
of
national
territory,
the
measurement
determining
the
state
limit
necessarily
commences
from
the
coastline
and
not
the
shoreline.
and
the
coastline
has
been
declared
by
congress
to
be
where
inland
waters
meet
the
open
sea.
fourth,
in
this
particular
case,
louisiana
has
filed
a
motion
to
take
depositions
of
various
facts
or,
in
the
alternative,
to
have
the
case
transferred
to
the
district
court
for
such
place.
now,
the
primary
problem
is
the
baseline
from
which
louisiana's
boundary
is
to
be
measured
and
that
is,
whether
from
louisiana's
coast
as
the
enabling
act
admitting
louisiana
provides
for
are
from
the
shore
or
whether
that
measurement
is
to
be
three
leagues
as
we
plead
the
enabling
act
also
provides
or
three
miles.
we
believe
that
the
court
might
very
well
conclude
that
the
enabling
act
makes
it
clear
that
the
baseline
is
the
coast
and
not
the
shore,
that
the
measurement
is
three
leagues,
not
three
miles
if,
indeed,
the
court
has
not
rendered
all
of
these
unnecessary
by
deciding
that
louisiana
is
entitled
to
the
entire
continental
shelf.
but
if
the
court
entertains
any
doubt
as
to
whether
the
congress
in
1812
chose
the
word
“coast”
instead
of
“shore”
intentionally
or
whether
the
congress
in
1812
said
“three
leagues”
intentionally,
then
in
keeping
with
the
mandate
of
the
congress
in
the
submerged
lands
act,
louisiana
is
entitled
to
produce
evidence
to
show
that
the
implication
and
the
necessary
implication
and
the
real
meaning
of
the
enabling
act
was
and
is
that
louisiana
is
to
have
within
its
territory
all
submerged
lands
within
three
leagues
of
its
coast
as
it
existed
in
1812,
145
years
ago.
now,
there
is
one
other
matter
that
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
--
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
we
were
admitted
in
1812.
see,
we
were
admitted
in
1812,
mr.
justice.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
that's
right.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
prior
to
and
at
the
time
of
admission.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
yes,
correct.
now,
there's
another
matter,
mr.
justice,
that
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
in
this
case.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
we
wanted
to
prove
that
the
necessary
implication
and
the
real
meaning
of
the
enabling
act
was
and
is
that
louisiana
was
to
have,
within
its
territory,
all
submerged
lands
within
three
leagues
of
its
coast
as
it
existed
in
1812.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
“by
the
coast,”
we
mean
the
line
which
marks
the
inland
waters
from
the
open
sea.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
yes.
now,
louisiana,
pursuant
to
the
--
let
me
say
this.pursuant
to
the
submerged
lands
act,
which
uses
the
word
“coast,”
redefined,
reasserted,
and
reconfirmed
by
the
passage
of
act
33
of
1954
its
coastline
in
accordance
with
what
we
claimed
congressional
authority.
we
claimed
that
our
coastline,
this
backline
right
here,
because
our
enabling
act
said
“including
all
islands
within
three
leagues
of
the
coast,”
and
we
say
“within”
means
encompassed.
and
this
court
held
in
louisiana
versus
mississippi
that
our
eastern
boundary
over
here
by
the
chandeleur
island
was
a
water
boundary
that
did
extend
out
to
this
particular
distance.
so,
we
contend
that
this
is
our
coastline.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
correct.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
it
is
taken
--
the
act
of
louisiana,
mr.
justice,
was
defined
by
the
legislature
of
louisiana
using
the
enabling
act.
if
we
were
admitted
to
the
union,
the
act
--
the
state
was
admitted
to
the
union
and
the
coast
guard
line,
which
congress
authorized
to
come
to
the
coast
guard
to
establish
i
think
in
1807,
again
in
1850-something,
again
in
1895,
and
it
was
done
and
it
is
used.
