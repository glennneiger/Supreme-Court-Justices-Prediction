justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
operations
are
now
going
on
under
that
stipulation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
means
grants
getting
into
this
specific
case
that
if
it
could
be
historically
established
in
that
argument
because,
if
he's
here,
the
motion
is
stretched.
the
conscientious
historian
reads
the
conclusion
to
mean
they
were
excessive
to
this
court.
that,
in
fact,
at
the
time
that
louisiana
came
into
the
union,
they
came
up
next
to
this
country
by
the
louisiana
treaty,
it
claimed
a
right,
then
it
would
be
three
leagues.
does
that
mean
that
the
submerged
lands
act
would
carry
three
leagues
to
louisiana?
justice
felix
frankfurter
assuming
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
assuming
that
the
government
--
the
court
would
have
to
say
a
few
words
on
examining
the
record.
conscientiously,
yes,
that
was
--
that
was
the
historic
claim
and
exerted
upon
this
town
to
be
exerted
by
what
was
louisiana,
before
it
became
part
of
the
united
states,
was
three
leagues.
what
--
assuming
--
assuming
that
concludes
it,
how
do
you
put
that
in
the
court,
your
submission,
would
that
carry
three
leagues
to
louisiana?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
put
it
back?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
need
clarification.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
want
to
be
more
--
i
ought
to
be
familiar
with
the
act,
and
i'm
direct
authority
in
1953.
what
i
understood
you
to
say
a
little
while
ago
is
that
what
congress
granted
in
1953
carried
only
up
to
the
three-mile
limit
with
some
exceptions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
was
the
exception?
that
we
suppose
that
there
might
be
a
different
situation
with
reference
to
different
states,
and
the
equal
footing
clause,
therefore,
though
applicable
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
might
be
differently
treated
by
acts
of
congress
within
its
power,
as
justice
black
said,
to
deploy
the
property.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
then,
what
if
--
is
the
equal
footing
determinative,
by
itself,
of
all
the
right
of
the
state
bordering
on
the
sea?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then,
i
don't
--
i
still
--
i
need
more
possibility.
if
congress
saw
fit
--
if
congress
saw
it
fit
to
recognize
right
in
louisiana,
going
out
of
--
of
the
supposed
issues
of
historic
situation,
could
it
not
do
so,
although
it
itself
were
restricted
to
the
three-mile
limit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
does
that
exception
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
that's
having
proved
it.
i'm
assuming,
hypothetically,
that
you've
come
into
court
here
and
say,
and
if
i
may
say
so,
you
were,
that
that
was
the
evidence
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that,
if
so,
is
there
any
legal
consequence
that
followed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
base
it
to
my
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
political
determination
derived
from
the
equal
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
equal
footing
clause?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then,
the
exception
doesn't
give
anything
because
the
principle
you
just
invoked
would
cut
it
down.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then,
i
don't
understand
what
the
exception
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
just
as
an
academic
exercise.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
see
if
i
issued
a
fair
statement
of
what
you
said.
that,
although
the
act
of
congress
is
typically
restricted,
as
a
generality,
to
three
miles
and
although
the
act
of
congress
--
although
that
was
done
under
representation
by
the
state
department,
that
has
been,
from
the
time
the
jeffersons
took
it,
the
uninterrupted
position
of
the
united
states.
although
that
was
a
submission
of
the
state
department
as
to
the
right
of
the
government,
and
congress
put
in
the
three-mile
limit
as
the
generality.
yet,
it
has
put
in
an
exception
allowing
them
to
what
you
call
proof
to
historic
facts
that
it
went
beyond.
that,
nevertheless,
if
they
do
prove
--
nevertheless,
if
they
do
prove
it
is
the
question
for
the
court
--
this
court
to
decide
whether
the
state
department
was
right
that
three-mile
--
that
three
miles
is
the
extent,
the
full
extent,
of
any
assertion
of
rights
by
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
that,
in
it
of
itself,
precluded
any
state
from
having
anymore.does
that
mean
to
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
--
i
don't
know
why
i
--
i
think
i
got
in
my
own
mind.
if
that's
the
issue,
that
is
to
be
exchanged,
that
is
an
issue
that
is
all
verging
to
the
conversation
and
colloquy
between
you
and
me.
i
understood
you
to
say
that,
assuming
they
could
prove
it,
up
to
the
hill,
they
can't
legally
derive
any
benefits
from
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
this
is
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
go
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
mr.
justice
black's
question.
i
thought
his
question
was
we
should
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
they
couldn't
have
issued.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
they
can't
prove
it.
that's
a
very
different
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
thought
you
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
historically.
justice
felix
frankfurter
including
without
prejudice
in
claim
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
you
say
the
matter
of
the
law
confining
this
court
in
adjudicating
this
contemplation
must
recognize,
no
matter
what
the
historic
position
was
when
louisiana
came
in,
the
unit
for
the
controlling
law
of
territorial
water
act
of
this
country,
of
the
nation,
is
limited
to
three.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
louisiana
can't
go
beyond
that
and
can't
have
anything
beyond
it,
no
matter
what.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
this
is
a
question
of
construction.
you've
got
permission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor,
will
you
forgive
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
making
a
suggestion
in
your
own
judgment.
i
take
it,
this
much
would
carry
out,
the
legal
question
which
finally
emerged
from
this
land
is
a
more
manageable
problem
of
the
court
than
the
facts
here
because
if
they
can't
establish
this,
then
they're
out
of
luck.
justice
felix
frankfurter
doesn't
--
do
you
mind
my
suggesting
to
keep
in
mind
that,
in
your
time,
an
adequate
consideration
of
the
facts
of
this
case,
as
to
which
i
suppose
you
are
less
informed
and
the
tables
are
being
unfortunate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
doesn't
that
affect
your
argument,
mr.
solicitor?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
say
that
the
determination
of
the
original
true
boundary
approved
beyond
it
is
not
for
this
court.
i
mean,
are
the
facts
that
we
thought
about
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
say
that
the
determination
of
the
boundaries
would
be
irrelevant
to
the
issue
because
the
boundary
of
the
united
states
is
international?
the
conception
by
the
united
states
of
the
limits
of
its
international
boundary
is
gone.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
should
i
care
if
it's
not
five
leagues
in
the
pleadings
if
it
can't
be
more
than
three
miles?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
it's
crystal
clear
now.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
the
senate
is
going
to
approach
it,
but
you
talked
about
ascertaining
the
boundary
of
the
state
from
the
nation.
that
isn't
accurate
because
the
boundary
of
the
state
is
not
in
that
cleared
facts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
have
to
worry
about
it
because
you
can
see
they
are
entitled
to
three
miles.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
i
don't
have
to
worry
what
their
new
boundary
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
the
three-mile
limitation
as
the
boundary
of
the
united
states,
is
that
an
issue
between
the
government
and
louisiana
or
do
they
accept
three
miles?
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
are
--
these
are
acknowledgement
as
to
what
the
state's
boundary
was,
but
the
part
of
the
international
law
position
of
the
government
is
mainly
three
miles.
is
that
taken
as
the
norm
of
the
international
water
right
as
it's
perceived
to
be
by
the
united
states?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
actually,
it
tells
and
allows
geographic
facts
to
be
withheld.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or,
it
could
have
been
heretofore
approved
by
congress.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
i
want
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
louisiana
challenges
the
general
proposition
that,
as
a
general
view
point
of
national
politics,
we
were
guided
by
as
far
as
the
bullet
could
reach,
three
miles.
as
i
understand
from
what
you
say,
they
say,
as
to
louisiana,
we've
got
all
this
recognition
by
way
of
congress.
but
is
there
an
issue
that
we
have
to
decide
or
could
one
take
for
granted
that
that
is
not
challenged.
that's
the
general
policy
of
the
united
states
since
jefferson's
days.
it
was
a
three-mile
limit,
although,
in
reference
to
those
terms
under
which
texas
came
in,
the
terms
under
which
louisiana
came
in,
and
instances
in
which
the
united
states
made
a
different
limit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
where
the
issue
lies?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
lost
it
by
this
principle
of
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
may
--
in
short,
it
gets
down
whether
one
may
what
--
this
isn't,
from
your
point
of
view,
a
question
of
geography,
but
a
question
of
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
matter
what
it
had
before?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
say
--
did
you
say
yes
to
that
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
we'd
need
to
examine
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
that
the
secretary
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
that
secretary
dulles's
letter
was
absolutely
controlling
on
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
didn't
you
have
a
talk
about
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
here,
you
regarded
the
matter
he
talked
about
in
that
letter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
namely,
what
the
policy
of
this
country
has
been
regarding
the
three
--
regarding
the
nautical
claims
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor,
is
it
correct
to
say
that
one
can
start,
i
believe,
with
full
acceptance
of
what
the
secretary
of
state
has
written
in
his
letter?
"i
don't
have
to
go
behind
his
evidence
at
all
myself
because
they
didn't
have
to
reach
--
i
don't
have
to
follow
them.
i
accept
the
admission
that
this
court
is
controlling.”
starting
from
there,
that
letter
sheds
no
light
on
the
last
sentence
of
section
4,
the
tideland
act,
except
insofar
as
it
involved
that
the
united
states
for
itself
did
not
make
claim
beyond
the
three-mile
limit,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
sot
he
crucial
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
isn't
--
hasn't
taken
it
very
farfetched.
the
secretary's
letter
doesn't
take
it
very
far.
it
can
take
me
anywhere
of
the
fact
in
regard
to
the
construction
of
that
letter.
and
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
except,
the
united
states
itself
made
no
claim
beyond
the
three
miles.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
think
that's
involved
but
that
doesn't
--
still
doesn't
help
you
to
deal
with
the
problem
raised
by
the
last
state
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
is
not
involved
in
the
secretary's
letter.
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
--
must
--
i
can't
take
that
law
from
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(a)
he
doesn't
send
it,
(b)
i
wouldn't
take
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
i
tried
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
tried
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you've
answered
justice
black,
unless
that's
what
ended
into
his
question
of
your
answer
that
if
congress
can
explicitly
give
the
tideland
possession
act,
although
we
ourselves
claimed
no
right
to
drill
for
oil
beyond
the
three-mile
limit,
nothing
in
this
act
shall
preclude
louisiana
from
doing
this.
it
would
have
a
very
different
policy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
depends
on
how
you
construe
the
effect.
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
foreclosing
it.
i
need
to
hardly
say
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
put
this
question
to
you,
sir.
always
being
hesitant
of
putting
a
hypothetical
question
that
isn't
directly
rather
than
the
issue.
suppose
congress
had
made
an
extended
investigation
in
the
various
state
claims
and
has
concluded,
just
making
a
big
supplement,
and
has
concluded
that
louisiana
is
the
only
state
that,
in
fact,
asserted
rights
in
water
extending
to
three
leagues.
suppose
that
is
satisfied,
it
need
not
show
permission
permitting
you
whatever
the
finding
physically
herein,
and
congress
had
specifically
written
into
the
recession
act
of
1953
whereas,
we
made
an
investigation
and
found
that
louisiana
may
develop
oil
up
to
the
three
leagues.
would
that
be
beyond
the
power
of
congress?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
yet,
if
it
found
so,
you
--
louisiana
would
be
exercising
rights
that
no
other
state
could
be
exercising
and
therefore,
bringing
the
question
which
clause
do
we
actually
read.
what
does
equal
footing
clause
mean,
anyhow?
that
would
be
just
geographic
of
taking
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
up
to
your
courts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
--
if
that's
so
--
if
it's
just
that,
there
is
a
question
of
demonstrating
or
disproving
that
they
had
it,
if
on
just
for
them.
and
if
that's
the
case,
“if
any,”
normally,
“if
any”
means
something
that
could
be
established
in
the
court
of
law.
and
if
it
is
established,
legal
consequences
follow.
but
it
comes
with
your
case
that
even
though
they
could
establish
it,
no
legal
consequences
follow
because
of
the
paramount
restriction
of
any
rights
of
louisiana
to
be
internationally
asserted
in
court
now.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
follow
you.
i
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
fact
you
gave
to
us
in
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
black,
namely,
whether
what
you
call
very
clear
is
very
clear.
if
congress
had
said
what
you
have
said,
there
wouldn't
be
a
problem
except,
if
congress
had
said,
i
don't
see
why
a
court
within
its
jurisdiction
doesn't
allow
louisiana
to
make
a
geographic
demonstration.
that's
entirely
a
judicial
purpose
about
it,
interesting
as
though
it
might
be.
on
the
other
hand
in
certain
other
things,
whatever
plan
they
had,
they
may
assert
in
a
court
of
law
their
viewpoints,
some
of
the
courts
in
some
of
the
places,
that
that
is
a
part
of
it
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
could
get
oil
exploiting
authority
to
the
state
of
louisiana
beyond
three
miles,
if
it
could.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
that
--
i'm
not
saying
you're
not
right.
i'm
not
saying
that
you're
not
right
that
they
have
shut
it
off.
all
i'm
saying
is
if,
as
much
as
i
am
speaking
to
say,
if
i
may
say
so,
correctly,
congress
could,
we
get
back
to
the
question
of
what
is
in
that
suit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
that
louisiana
said
three
miles
--
three
miles,
but
that
the
united
states
says.
and
i
suggest,
again,
there
is
that
old
difficulty
of
the
theory
being
many.
and
when
you
say
that
congress
could
authorize
louisiana,
if
it
passed
the
specific
statute,
after
our
decision,
we
said
that
we
now
reconsider
this
thing
and
you
have
--
you
may
explore
or
exploit
oil
out
to
three
leagues
if
you
say
congress
could
do
that.
i
believe
you're
right
to
saying
that,
if
i
may
say
so.
then,
the
question
gets
back
to
what
the
statute
means
and
it
wouldn't
be
the
first
time
that
congress
passed
up
to
this
court
a
cloud
in
the
statute.
i'm
not
saying
it
is
cloudy,
but
it
puts
--
congress
is
not
incapable,
with
every
respect
for
it,
of
using
a
lot
on
the
words
which
would
satisfy
contradictory
elements.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
don't
have
to
say
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
here
is
this
ocean
in
which
--
when
we
talk
in
terms
of
proprietorship
entitled
about
the
ocean
beyond
the
three-mile
limit,
i
think
we
get
into
trouble.
we
get
all
sorts
of
different
rights,
and
they're
not
foreclosed
by
all
private
types.
what
case
was
it
where
we
allowed
expunge
fish
way
out,
i
don't
know
how
many
miles.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
ready
to
take
that
to
serve
as
a
case.
i'll
be
giving
that
as
an
illustration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
scariotis,
not
without
this
difficulty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
going
to
deal
with
the
geography
on
your
--
when
you
reply
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
you
be
able
to
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
trouble
you
to
tell
me
what
--
to
what
you
mean
"by
the
coast."
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
from
there,
the
three
league
was
measured.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
wilkinson.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i
get
out
of
secretary
dulles'
letter,
i've
indicated
i've
seen
that
controlling
on
this
case.
what
the
attitude
of
this
country
is,
these
are
the
other
countries
in
asserting
its
right
on
the
matter
of
the
pleading.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
matters
of
declarations
by
the
secretary
of
state,
passed
the
international
policy
of
the
government
which,
for
me,
doesn't
foreclose
the
questions
in
this
case
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
if
that
--
if
that's
foreclosed,
whether
or
not,
international
law,
whether
that's
the
their
meaning,
that
the
government
of
the
united
states,
according
to
the
secretary
of
state,
speaks
with
authority
and
conclusively
on
that
point,
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
had,
from
the
day
it
sent
this
down,
maintained
that
its
attitude
and
intonations
with
other
nation
what
right
it
claims
on
the
seas.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
internationally,
the
claim
or
the
position
of
the
united
states
in
matters
of
the
international
law,
so-called,
are
not
to
be
found
merely
in
treaties.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
would
be
found
in
the
continuous
practice
of
the
government.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
why
we
can't
get
judicial
notice
of
every
class
of
evidence
on
which
you
--
to
which
you
appeal,
except
living
witness
--
testimony
of
living
witness.
isn't
there
a
general
provision
about
certain
crimes
and
public
documents
to
the
court?
are
these
treaties,
aren't
they
included
in
official
volumes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
between
what
parties
are
these?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
these
treaties
preceding
the
admission
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
the
treaties?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
trouble
you
to
turn
to
the
act
of
admission
and
state
more
specifically
what
ambiguous
term
in
that
act
of
admission
would
be
illuminated
by
the
testimony
in
which
you
would
like
to
have
made
available.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'll
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
they
prove
your
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
the
evidence
--
would
the
evidence
give
proof
of
that
fact?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
suppose
you
do
take
the
government
on
its
claim
of
law
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
foreclose
the
question,
namely,
what
was
the
act
of
congress
in
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
leave
out
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
leave
out
an
important
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
that
you
don't
know
it.
of
course,
you
do,
but
we're
not
at
large
here.
at
least
we're
not
in
the
open
sea.
if,
after
the
decisions
in
this
court
in
the
gulf
state,
texas
and
louisiana
decisions,
after
those
decisions,
the
claim
that
your
state
now
makes
no
longer
exists.
it's
rejected.
is
that
right,
in
those
decisions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
claim
was
rejected.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and,
if
congress
had
never
passed
the
statute,
you
wouldn't
be
here.
there
wouldn't
be
a
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and,
therefore,
what
i
would
like
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
tried
and
--
and
that
litigation
was
closed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
whatever
rights
you
may
have,
if
any,
derived
from
the
passage
by
congress
in
may,
it
was
in
may,
of
1953
of
this
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
the
closer
we
hug
the
shore
of
this
act,
the
clearer
the
issues
will
be
and
the
less
confused
we'll
be,
even
the
judicial
minds.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
court
is
never
confused.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
try
to
derived
some
right
of
the
precise
grants,
whatever
it
may
be,
that
congress
made
in
this
act
and,
therefore,
it
seems
to
me
quite
unhealthy
to
argue
anew
if
though
that
were
an
original
question,
whether
the
government
of
the
united
states
had
a
title
or
whatever
it
did
have,
whether
the
state
had
a
coterminous
title,
where
they
had
less
or
more,
all
those
issues
were
foreclosed
not
as
a
title,
as
i
remember
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
argue
it,
but
as
to
dominion
in
those
tideland
cases.
and
therefore,
you
tried
to
persuade
this
court
that
what
congress
granted
is
what
this
court
said
is
a
matter
of
so-called
interstate
common
law
the
state
didn't
have.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
is
that
correct?
is
that
the
issue?
justice
felix
frankfurter
please
be
good
enough
to
correct
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
congress
has
no
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
then
the
government
has
no
standing
here
at
all
if
you
are
right
about
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
the
government
hasn't
any
--
anything
to
which
--
to
make
a
claim.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
not
that
the
united
states
congress
said
“we
want
to
exert
no
authority,
whatever.”
it
wouldn't
be
the
first
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
the
united
states
has
passed
legislation
saying,
“an
adjudication
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
shall,
in
the
matter
of
public
policy,
within
our
control,
not
be
the
assertion
of
a
federal
right,”
because
that's
in
the
favor
of
the
famous
evie
rich
case.
you
tell
me
that's
what
the
congress
did
and
i'll
listen
to
you
with
great
interest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
surprisingly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
take
that
position
then,
in
effect,
you
are
asking
this
court
to
reconsider
its
decision
in
louisiana
--
in
louisiana
and
that's
your
case.
is
that
right?
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
issue?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what's
going
on?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
this
is
really
what
the
statute
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
this
statute,
all
is
bounded
to,
in
section
4,
was
an
invitation
of
the
supreme
court
to
grant
a
rehearing
or
initiate
a
rehearing
to
reconsider
its
decision
in
u.s.
against
louisiana,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
--
this
court,
in
an
opinion
with
which
i
happen
not
to
agree
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
which
i
happen
not
to
agree,
decided,
as
clearly
as
anything
was
ever
decided,
that
that
position
is
wrong
in
laws.
and
while
i
have
to
follow
the
record,
you
say
you
want
to
argue
it
today,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
there
are
four
by
category
in
your
motion
paper,
didn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
four?
you
said
four
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
category
of
things
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
you
would
like
to
have
put
at
issue
at
a
hearing
in
your
motion
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
those
are
the
categories
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
we
have
before
us
now.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
anything
to
add
to
that
or,
now,
can
we
stand
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
something
may
appear
to
be
absolutely
clear.
it
could
just
be
any
english
words
and
the
testimony
he'd
make
sure
that
it's
clear
the
other
way.
these
words
are
to
be
embedded
in
the
context
of
their
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
you
can't
just
read
it
and
say,
“i
know
what
this
means.”
if
you
have
relevant
evidence,
then
it
really
means
something
very
different.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
indicated
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
declined
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
no
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
of
an
empty
promise?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
could
they
do?
would
you
mind
being
very
particular,
what
is
it
in
rejecting
the
people
who
didn't
want
to
--
who
wanted
to
foreclose
the
issue
by
not
recognizing
it,
those
who
wanted
a
blessing,
as
you
--
they
took
neither
of
these
two
and
said
“if
you
can
prove
your
claim,
go
ahead
and
prove.”
now,
what
is
it
they
were
allowed
to
prove?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
an
issue
that's
tried
and
simple,
doable,
determinable,
or
is
it
foreclosed
that,
even
--
that
though
they
have
proved
it
or
they
may
prove
it
up
to
their
year,
since
the
international
policy
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
was
to
limit
its
claim
of
right
to
extend
not
beyond
the
three-mile
limit,
no
state
could
go
beyond
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then,
why
should
we
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
doesn't
everybody
include
us?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
whether
you
can't
with
the
candor,
you
agree
that
congress
need
not
to
be
bound
by
it
because
res
judicata
didn't
apply
to
a
different
conception
of
policy
by
congress.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
suppose
i
accept
that.
i
would
like
you
to
be
good
enough
to
illustrate
this.
in
the
secretary's
letter,
setting
forth
the
political
policy
of
the,
certainly,
foreign
affairs
directing
branch
of
our
government,
secretary
of
state
says
the
position
of
the
united
states
--
their
position
on
the
three-mile
limit,
page
159
of
his
letter
to
you,
the
position
of
the
united
states
on
the
three-mile
limit
has
been
made
unchanged
to
this
day,
and
at
no
time
has
this
government
found
a
different
policy
regarding
the
extent
of
its
territorial
waters
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
that
his
statement
to
you
as
to
the
policy
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government.
but,
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
in
the
act,
we
have
to
construe,
does
makes
a
difference.
in
section
(b),
to
which
you
referred,
they
gave
it
additional
power
which
shall
not
be
interpreted
as
extending
it
from
the
coastline
more
than
three
geographical
miles
in
the
atlantic
ocean
or
the
pacific
ocean
or
more
than
three
marine
leagues
into
the
gulf
of
mexico.
and,
how
can
i
have
reached
that,
except
to
this
extent
that
the
finding
that
the
congress
adopted
a
different
policy
and
allowed
rights
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
different
from
that
secretary
dulles
telling
the
united
states
in
all
the
waters.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
it
says
that,
but
it
shouldn't
be
differentiated
interest
in
the
gulf
of
mexico,
different
from
the
atlantic
and
the
pacific
ocean.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
if
you
found
out
if
some
--
i
was
trying
to
find
some
significance
not
to
forget
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
--
but
you
say
it
is
an
inadmissible
interest
that
they
come
to
court
and
establish
that
claim
not
foreclosed
by
what
we
decide
in
the
california,
louisiana,
and
texas
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
not
when
the
original
requirement
has
been
originally
got
louisiana
from
the
poll.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
--
may
i
asked
a
question,
mr.
solicitor.
as
i
understand
it,
the
motion
of
leagues
makes
the
question
the
--
those
are
the
questions
--
that
assumption
goes
to
the
question
that
you
think
will
be
determined
apart
from
it,
what
it
sought
to
find
out
that,
namely,
whether
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
including
the
one
whether
--
the
one
the
statute
is
about,
whether
it
is
three
leagues
or
three
miles.
and,
isn't
that
included
in
the
subject
matter
regarding
the
way
the
state
of
louisiana
certainly
can't
start
it
unless
you
take
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'd
like
to
ask
you
one
more
question
regarding
that
view.
assume
we
reach
the
question
where
the
court
thinks
that
the
deposition
would
be
just
one
required.
we
would
now,
or
perhaps
in
the
memorandum,
to
indicate
the
view
of
the
department
of
whether
the
court
should
allow
to
extend
while
you
take
--
to
a
maximum
of
20
miles,
according
to
these
records,
as
you
wish
or
whether
it
should
take
appropriate
steps
and
try
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
preference
is
the
master.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
follow
that,
because
the
state
may
own
what
are
called
adjacent
islands
or
an
adjacent
island,
do
i,
at
that
time,
so
that
i
would
may
be
out
3-12
miles,
i
believe
the
catalina
island
is,
off
the
shore
of
california,
could
that
carry
with
it
that's
kind
of
mean
what
the
right
of
the
water
intervening
are?
