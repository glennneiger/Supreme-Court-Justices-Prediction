justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
solicitor
general.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
then,
is
your
--
on
your
premise,
is
the
issue
(inaudible)
for
the
united
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
my
question
was
not
--
didn't
carry
the
idea
as
i
intended.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
say
that
you
go
on
the
premise,
first,
that
it's
already
been
decided
that
louisiana
did
not
own
the
title.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then,
you
say
that
an
act
had
been
passed.
is
it
your
contention
that
there's
nothing
left
except
the
question
of
law
as
to
interpreting
the
meaning
of
the
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
do
not
quite
understand
your
addition.
i
understood
you.
right
now,
i
don't
understand
you.
the
first
decision,
res
judicata,
determined
that
louisiana
did
not
have
the
title
of
the
right
to
this
tidelands.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
congress
came
along,
with
its
power
to
dispose
of
government
matters,
and
passed
an
act
which
granted
them
some
interest
in
the
tidelands.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
the
issue
was,
i
understood
you
to
say,
first,
what
that
act
meant.
now,
i
understand
you
to
say
that
you've
got
to
look
back
and
behind
that
act
would
represent
judicial
knowledge,
you
think,
of
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you're
right
in
your
pages.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
may
i
ask
you,
if
i
may
interrupt
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
kind
of
gets
us
down
to
what
the
basic
issue
really
is.
if
congress
intended
to
leave
it
up
to
prove,
as
i
understand
it,
what
you
said
at
the
beginning,
you
are
asking
us
to
take
the
judicial
knowledge
of
proof,
rather
than
to
give
louisiana
here
as
evidence
the
findings
made
on
the
proof
that
they're
supposed
to
have
gave.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
we
--
you
finally
get
down
then
to
the
basic
issue,
as
i
understand
it,
assuming
that
the
act
means
that
they
can
prove
their
claim,
over
this
period
of
time,
that
there's
more
than
three
miles,
the
question
before
us
is
whether
we
would
take
judicial
knowledge
of
the
fact
which
show
they
can
prove
whether
we
will
have
via
hearing
--
have
a
hearing
now
to
determine
the
facts
on
whether
they
have
--
can
establish
by
proof
that
which
congress,
you
said,
entitled
them
to
more
than
three
miles.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
can't
prove
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
do
not
have
to
enunciate.
do
i
understand
that,
through
the
act,
it
means,
it
left
only
any
state
that
could
prove,
by
evidence,
that
it
was
entitled
to
more
than
three
miles
of
its
shores?
justice
hugo
l.
black
historically.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
exact
language
in
the
act
now
at
issue
which
you
refer,
would
you
mind?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
suppose
they
could
prove
that,
in
their
constitution
or
law
prior
to
that
time,
they
had
claimed
more
than
three
geographical
miles.
what
do
you
say
would
be
developed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that,
this
would
be
separate.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
--
suppose
congress
had
simply
said
they
could
have
nine
miles,
could
it
have
done
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
why
could
it
not
attach
the
condition,
that
--
say,
if
you
had
a
condition
like
here,
why
would
it
be
bound
by
what
it
considered
or
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
could
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
question
before
us.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
is
it
your
position
that
it
was
more
inane
what
was
going
on
before
us
would
be
impossible
to
prove
that
the
boundary
that
you've
got
is
three
miles?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
another
way
that
this
would
lead
only
leaning
in?
the
reference
is
that
three
marine
leagues
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
is
it
the
government's
position
that
it's
impossible
for
them
to
prove
that
by
any
evidence
prior
to
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
congress
had
decided,
however,
to
say
that
that
was
not
here
--
done
here,
if
it
is
done
in
connection
with
what
taken
place.
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
we
get
back
to
what
it
intended.
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
though
they
would
have
to
take
it
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
it
could
also
contend,
i
don't
know
what
it
amounts
to,
but
that
they
can't
not
delimit
the
claim
of
the
three
miles.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
passing
it
over
to
the
courts,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
other
place
that
gets
congress
to
establish
that
line
that
was
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
do
you
suppose
it
should
be,
within
your
theory,
along
that
coast
in
standards
that
were
referenced
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
submit
a
report
to
make
any
effort
to
explain
the
language
or
even
proving
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
make
it
clear
that
something
was
actually
left
open,
that
that
was
to
be
decided
by
the
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
proof?
did
they
say
on
proof?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
could
get
it
from
the
act.
they
could
actually
prove
the
meaning
that
this
might
be
better
if
they
did
not
previously
had
been
beyond
certain
places.
we'd
never
give
them
this
much
or
we'd
had
to
give
them
so
much
on
certain
proof
and
form
a
decision
that
this
court
wouldn't
even
suggest.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
have
to
look
to
the
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
exists
at
the
time
the
state
became
a
member
of
the
union.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then,
over
another
one,
they
explained
that
they
wanted
that
to
be
construed
as
inadvertently
that
it
would
be
considered
in
the
light
of
what
was
“prior
to”
or
“at
that
time.”
isn't
that
what
section
4
mean?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
or
it's
denied.
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
law
has
provided
the
trial
but
i
think
that's
in
a
section
or
the
constitution
provides
the
trial.
the
law
should
not
--
just
as
the
date
he
came
in,
that
they
did
have
(inaudible)
nine
miles
out
or
three
leagues
out.
what
about
this?
you
would
say
that
all
that
disappeared
when
they
became
a
part
of
the
union
when
they
were
admitted
the
day
they
would
--
the
moment
they
went
in?
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
if
the
moment
(inaudible)
their
constitution
had
provided
or
the
law
had
provided
that
they
extend
out
nine
or
three
leagues?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
that
were
true
and
they
actually
did
that.
congress
came
along
and
said
that,
in
spite
of
the
facts,
they
lost
everything
up
to
--
beyond
the
three
miles
when
they
came
in.
we
got
to
let
them
have
nine
miles
now
if
they
could
prove
the
trial
to
decide
they
came
into
the
union
or
the
trial
has
been
and
they
were
admitted,
their
constitutional
laws
provided
nothing
on
this.
would
that
be
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
where
we
get
to
admit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
to
find
a
way
we
get
back
when
it
was
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
i'm
not
sure,
if
your
contention
is
correct,
this
language
is
found
to
say
it
could
mean
anything.
was
it
ever
used
here?
because
if
it
was
already
approved
on
conclusion
that
it
only
has
three
miles
when
it
came
in,
that's
all
that
it
gets,
all
this
language
from
the
natural
thing,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
1812?
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
the
time
of
admission.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean,
before
it
was
admitted
or
at
the
time
it
was
admitted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean,
before?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
you
say
you
wanted,
an
opportunity
to
reverse
the
facts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
you
give
us
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
mean
if
we
accepted
what
he
said
that
would
decide
the
case
against
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
say
that
the
evidence
of
the
shrinking
would
be
able
to
prove
what
is
under
the
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
issue?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
has,
what
--
how
was
that
help
in
this
issue?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
congress
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
decided
to
do
so.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
congress
decided
to
do
so.
is
it
your
contention
that
it
could
not
constitutionally
do
that?
suppose
it
concluded
that
it
wanted
to
take
possession
or
control
of
some
kind
over
100
miles
out
in
the
ocean.
is
it
your
contention
that
it
would
unconstitutional,
but
you
say
that's
too
much
because
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
united
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
not
made
the
question
inferentially.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
just
a
question
here.
did
you
take
part
in
the
hearings
over
the
senate
on
this
bill?
they
have
hearings?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
louisiana
did
--
at
first,
i
was
going
to
ask,
i
thought
maybe
you
had
represented
louisiana's
claims.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
--
was
the
argument
that
you've
been
making
to
us
about
the
boundaries
presented
in
the
hearing
over
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
just
give
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
was
there
any
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
--
was
there
any
extended
comments
made
in
connection
with
louisiana's
claims
of
three
leagues
instead
of
the
three
miles?
justice
hugo
l.
black
wherever
it
went
to.
justice
hugo
l.
black
wherever
it
went
to.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
true
about
section
4?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
same
thing
true
about
section
4?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
led
them
to
say
it
didn't
have
any.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and,
i
say
to
you
that
i'd
hope,
before
you
finish,
to
save
enough
time
to
argue
the
case
on
the
merits.
congress
either
gave
you
something
in
this
act
or
you
don't
have
anything.
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
me,
that's
your
issue.
it
may
not
be
to
the
entire
court,
but
it
doesn't
help
to
devote
all
your
time
in
trying
to
put
it
on
the
--
you're
trying
to
put
it
on
the
baby
and,
somehow,
you
left
something
at
the
court's
decision.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
you
joined
issue
with
the
government's
statement
which
seems
to
disregard
the
words
“or
trial
thereto.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
on
page
21
of
the
government's
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
argument?
that
says
argument?
well,
that's
a
different
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and,
is
that
crucial
to
your
case,
the
truthfulness
of
the
acquisition
of
that
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but,
when
the
act
got
through,
you
had
something
down
there
that
you
didn't
have
under
this
court's
opinion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and,
unless
you
can
prove
that
the
court's
opinion
were
otherwise,
well,
i
suppose
you
have
to
say
that
you
--
they
have
here
the
subject
you
didn't
have
before.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
that
your
question
--
your
question
here
is
whether
the
congress,
in
this
act,
permitted
you
to
have
some
kind
of
a
trial
to
see
if
you
have
three
leagues
instead
of
three
miles.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
on
the
language
of
the
act
and
not
on
rationalizations
that
may
have
been
offered
as
why
the
act
was
passed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
are
you
reading
from?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
are
you
reading
from?
justice
hugo
l.
black
perhaps,
i
may
repeat,
and
i
won't
say
it
anymore,
speaking
as
one
member
of
the
court,
i
would
prefer
if
you
could
argue
your
case
on
what
the
statute
means.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
the
basis
that
you
didn't
have
anything,
congress
gave
us.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
see
it,
it's
your
issue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
is
that
--
is
that
the
end
of
your
position,
then
that's
alright.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
your
only
framework.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
they
are,
they
would
--
would
all
of
them
be
admissible?
now,
could
we
take
judicial
notice
of
all
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
or
some
of
them
we
could
not
take?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
challenge
to
that?
is
that
what
it's
supposed
to
suggest?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
challenge
here?
it's
just
that
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
understand
that
issue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
government
impinging
that
florida
can
get
this
tidelands
at
nine
miles
and
you
can't?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
saying
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you're
saying
that
if
we
had
the
case
of
texas
and
florida
in
court,
that
we'd
be
compelled
to
hold
that
they
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
three
leagues.
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
language
of
the
act
does
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
that,
i
think
is
the
very
language
of
the
act
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
though
it
happened,
the
state
found,
not
by
law,
would
be
found
a
national
boundary,
is
that
true?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
that
one
state
should
be
given
nine
leagues
though
the
other
isn't
given?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
may
i
ask
if
you've
given
us
all
the
answers
that
you
can
think
that
the
basic
issue
before
us
here,
for
us
to
decide
at
this
case
now.
shall
there
be
a
hearing
that
is
right
to
introduce
evidence
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
determine
some
issues?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
statute
says
that
--
it
provides
that
where
in
any
case
such
boundaries
had
existed
at
a
time
such
a
state
became
a
member
of
the
union,
and
so
forth?
justice
hugo
l.
black
had
you
given
us
all
the
illustration,
all
the
possibilities
you
think
you
can
offer
of
which
we
can't
take
judicial
notice
to
establish
the
occasion,
in
other
words,
that
you
need
a
hearing
for?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
in
a
general
way,
that's
the
issue
we
have.
what
--
what
is
it
that
you
can
offer
here
in
evidence
that
would
establish
your
right
to
have
three
leagues
out
in
the
gulf.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
wording,
that's
--
that's
--
you
don't
have
to
have
evidence
on
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean,
before
and
afterwards?
before
and
after
you
were
admitted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
else?
what
else,
in
order
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
testimony
of
witnesses
on
those
points.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
other
than
that,
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this
is,
sir?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
of
today,
seemed
to
me,
require
we
accept
it.
if
we
hold
that
these
several
references
to
these
three
leagues
will
just
fully
use
the
severance.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
if
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can
understand
that
argument
that
you
may.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but,
if
--
if
that
--
suppose
that's
not
correct.
do
you
claim
that
congress
went
beyond
its
constitutional
power
in
providing
that
those
states
would
be
clearly
different
than
to
the
others?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then,
it's
wholly
a
question
of
construction
of
the
statue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
--
what
it
means?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
up
to
date,
i
haven't
--
where
--
your
interpretation
should
give
it
anything
or
no?
