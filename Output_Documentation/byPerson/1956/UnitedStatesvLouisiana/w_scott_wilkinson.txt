mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
attorney
general
of
louisiana
made
an
opening
statement
to
outline
briefly
the
points
on
which
louisiana
relies
in
this
case,
leaving
to
me
the
matter
of
making
the
main
argument
and
answering
the
questions
that
the
court
may
have
propound
in
that
connection.
i
would
like
to
take
up
where
the
united
states
attorney
general
left
off
which
will
permit
me
more
or
less
to
go
chronologically
into
the
argument
of
the
case.
that
is,
i
would
like
to
start
on
the
proposition
that,
at
the
time
of
or
prior
to
the
time
that
louisiana
entered
into
the
union,
its
boundaries
were
three
leagues
or
more
from
its
coast
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
in
that
connection,
let
me
comment,
first,
upon
the
letter
of
the
secretary
of
state
which
the
solicitor
general
says
is
conclusive
on
the
court.
to
me,
that
is
an
unheard
of
proposition
that
a
plaintiff
from
the
case
may
bring
his
suit
before
court
to
ask
a
court
to
adjudicate
on
the
location
of
certain
boundaries.
then,
after
the
answer
of
the
defendant
is
filed,
to
write
to
another
official
of
the
government
and
ask
that
official
of
the
government
to
state
where
those
boundaries
are,
and
to
present
that
reply
to
this
court
and
to
say
that
that
decides
the
case.
it
isn't
necessary
to
have
this
court
if
that
is
so.
that
is
not
so.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
if
mr.
--
i
wouldn't
say
even
that
because
i'm
going
into
mr.
dulles'
letter
in
just
a
minute
to
read
a
part
of
it
that
the
solicitor
general
did
not
read
to
the
court.
i
know
he
didn't
leave
that
out
intentionally
because
neither
of
us
have
time
to
go
into
everything
we
might
choose
to
say
to
your
honors.
it
would
take
too
much
time
to
do
that.
first,
i
do
want
to
say
this.
opposing
counsel
referred
to
the
political
branches
of
the
government.
he
continued
to
refer
to
the
political
branches
of
the
government.
there's
not
just
one,
they
are
two
the
legislative
branch
and
the
executive
branch.
there's
never
been
a
treaty
entered
into
by
the
united
states.
it
was
not
negotiated
by
the
executive
department
and
concurred
in
by
a
two-thirds
vote
of
the
senate.
those
are
the
political
branches
of
the
government,
and
this
case
has
specifically
said
so
that
our
foreign
relations
--
in
the
(inaudible)
case
that's
quoted
in
our
brief
that
the
foreign
relations
of
this
nation
are
vested
in
the
political
departments
of
the
government
-
the
legislative
and
the
executive.
and,
it
would
be,
indeed,
a
noble
situation
if
either
one
of
these
two
had
the
sole
right
to
interpret
the
meaning
of
a
treaty
or
a
meaning
of
an
act
of
congress.
that
is
a
judicial
matter
for
this
court
to
determine.
it
is
true
that
there
have
been
cases
where
the
position
of
the
united
states
and
international
affairs
has
been
declared
to
be
thus
and
so
by
the
executive
department
of
the
government,
such
as
where
the
boundary
between
the
united
states
and
spain
may
have
been
at
a
certain
time,
and
the
court
has
refused
to
go
behind
that
statement
and
on
this
theory.
that
for
the
--
for
the
executive
department
of
the
government
to
say
to
a
foreign
nation
“our
boundary
is
here,”
and
then
this
court
to
come
and
say
that
it
isn't
there,
there
could
be
no
stability
in
our
government.
but,
in
matters
relating
between
the
united
states
and
a
state,
and
this
court
so
said
that
in
an
early
case
of
united
states
versus
texas
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
here,
in
matters
of
determining
boundaries
as
between
the
united
states
and
a
state
or
as
between
the
states
of
the
union,
those
are
matters
to
be
determined
by
the
judiciary.
and,
to
close
this
part
of
my
argument
as
quickly
as
i
may,
i
would
simply
like
to
read
this
short
statement
made
by
this
court
in
the
case
of
in
re
cooper,
reported
on
143
us
472,
also
cited
in
our
brief.
without
the
clear
--
this
is
what
this
court
said.
“without
the
clear
authority
of
the
law
of
commerce,
the
executive
can
never,
by
determining
a
so-called
political
question
or
by
construing
an
act
of
congress
or
a
treaty,
conclude
the
rights
of
persons
or
property
under
the
protection
of
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states
in
a
determination
of
these
rights.”
and,
that
is
exactly
the
situation
here.
you're
asked
to
determine
the
rights
of
the
state
of
louisiana
on
the
say
so
of
the
executive
department
of
the
government
and
without
reference
to
what
congress
may
have
said.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
yes,
sir?
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
i
think
that's
exactly
what
the
court
said
in
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
i
don't
think
it's
maintained
that
attitude.
reading
secretary
dulles'
letter
here,
we
find
that
thomas
jefferson
made
his
statement
in
1793.
that
is
quoted.
then,
he
skips
over
to
1868
where
he
quotes
a
statement
from
secretary
of
state
seward.
what
jefferson
did
say
in
1793
under
the
pressure
of
a
war
between
european
nations
when
america
was
a
weak
nation
that
had
just
achieved
its
independence
was
this.
the
greatest
distance
to
which
any
respectable
assent
among
nations
had
been
at
any
time
given
has
been
the
extent
of
the
human
sight
estimated
at
upward
of
20
miles
and
the
smallest
distance,
i
believe,
claimed
by
any
nation,
or
whatever,
is
a
range
of
cannonball
usually
stated
at
one
sea
league.
some
intermediate
distances
also
have
been
insisted
on
and
that
of
three
sea
leagues
has
some
authority
in
its
favor.
now,
here's
what
he
goes
on
to
say
with
reference
to
the
united
states.
the
character
of
our
coast,
remarkable
and
considerable
parts
of
it
--
and
certainly
remarkable
in
that
part
that
deals
with
the
state
of
louisiana
where
the
coastline
has
measured
467
miles
along
the
line
between
seaward
waters
in
the
open
sea
and
7793
miles
when
you
follow
all
the
sinuosities
of
the
coast
and
the
islands
and
the
bays
and
the
inlets
and
such,
the
character
of
our
coast
remarkable
and
considerable
parts
of
it
were
admitting
no
vessels
of
size
to
pass
near
the
shores
would
entitle
us
in
reason
to
as
broad
marginal
protected
navigation
as
any
nation,
whatever.
and,
he
says,
for
the
present,
we
will
be
restrained
in
to
distance
of
one
sea
league.
he,
after,
would
had
repudiated
that
statement.
he,
after
--
that
is,
he
repudiated
the
idea
that
that
three
miles
had
been
fixed
or
agreed
upon
as
a
national
boundary.
and,
your
honors
will
not
find
any
single
treaty
entered
into
by
the
united
states
wherein
the
territorial
waters
were
limited
to
three
miles,
nor
will
you
find
it
any
--
in
any
act
of
congress,
until
the
passage
of
the
submerged
lands
act
and
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
in
1953,
if
those
acts
could
be
construed
to
have
that
meaning
and,
of
course,
we
say
they
do
not.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
that's
right.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
yes,
sir,
that's
--
that's
correct.
and,
i
would
be
glad
to
go
into
the
continuous
practice
of
the
government
particularly
with
regard
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
because
we
have
to
bear
in
mind
that
when
louisiana
was
admitted
to
the
union,
the
gulf
of
mexico
occupied
quite
a
different
status
than
it
occupies
today.
the
gulf
of
mexico,
then,
was
an
enclosed
sea.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
up
until
1800,
the
whole
circumference
of
the
gulf
was
owned
by
the
kingdom
of
spain.
not
another
union
--
not
another
nation
in
the
united
states
had
a
foot
of
ground
boarding
on
the
gulf
of
mexico
prior
to
1800
when
spain
retroceded
the
territory
of
louisiana
to
france
and
then,
in
1803,
when
france
ceded
it
to
the
united
states.
just
before
that
occurred,
spain
owned
the
entire
circumference
of
the
gulf
of
mexico.
there
never
been
any
big
battles
fought
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
only
remember
one
naval
engagement
in
the
war
between
the
states
when
a
car
gets
fleet
to
take
mobile
bay
and,
the
other,
when
the
marines
attacked
at
veracruz.
the
big
battles
of
the
world
have
been
fought
on
the
atlantic
and
the
pacific
oceans
in
all
time.
the
atlantic
ocean
then
was
a
great
avenue
and
the
great
highway
of
commerce
in
the
world.
the
gulf
of
mexico
was
an
enclosed
sea.
and,
your
honors
will
find,
in
reading
the
statements
of
the
secretaries
of
state
of
the
united
states,
all
along,
many
of
those
statements
are
qualified
by
the
statement
that
this
government
has
subscribed
to
the
principle
of
a
territorial
limit
of
three
miles
on
our
eastern
coast.
and,
of
course,
that's
because
there
was
a
difference
and
there
should
be
a
difference
between
our
eastern
coast
and
the
gulf
of
mexico.
now,
the
act
of
admission
of
louisiana
into
the
union
in
1812
describes
its
limits
as
being
bounded
on
the
south
by
the
gulf
of
mexico
including
all
islands
within
three
leagues
of
its
coast.
this
act
of
admission
was
antedated
by
the
act
creating
the
territory
of
orleans
in
1804.
the
territory
of
orleans,
after,
what
became
the
state
of
louisiana.
that
act
creating
the
territory
of
orleans
described
the
boundaries
of
louisiana
as
being
all
--
territory
of
orleans
as
being
all
that
part
of
the
territory
of
louisiana
briefly
south
of
the
33rd
parallel
of
latitude,
which
is
a
present
northern
boundary
of
the
state
of
louisiana
was,
that,
without
any
exception,
without
the
reservation
of
any
seas,
islands,
submerged
lands
or
waters
or
anything
of
that
nature.
the
enabling
act
or
act
of
1811
provided
that
the
state
of
louisiana
might
be
incorporated
into
a
state
in
the
union,
admitted
on
an
equal
footing
with
other
states,
comprising
all
that
territory
of
louisiana
within
the
following
limits,
and
then,
proceed
to
detail
description
ending
up
including
all
islands
within
three
leagues
of
its
shore
--
coast,
i
mean.
well,
i'm
not
sure
if
it's
a
coast.
now,
our
--
our
position
on
that
subject
is
this.
that
either
that
means
that
our
limits,
our
three
leagues
from
the
coast
or
else,
that
is
not
a
clear
description.
we
say
that
the
act
has
been
interpreted
by
the
acts,
by
the
contemporary
construction
over
a
long
period
of
time,
by
the
legislature
and
by
the
officials
of
louisiana,
as
well
as
by
the
actions
of
the
united
states
commerce.
the
citizens
of
louisiana
had,
from
time
and
memorial,
made
use
of
the
oyster
beds
and
leased
them
for
private
exploitation
in
the
gulf
of
mexico,
three
leagues
and
even
beyond
three
leagues
from
the
shores
of
louisiana
and
within
the
mine
shown
on
the
map
here
as
the
louisiana
boundary
of
the
act
33
of
1954.
the
shoaled
of
the
state
of
louisiana
come
out
into
the
golf
here,
as
far
out
as
what
they
call
the
coastguard
line.
there
are
places
there
where
there
are
less
than
two
fathoms
in
depth.
that
is
a
very
narrow
coast
and,
the
coast
there,
the
coast
line
changes
sometimes
from
day
to
day.
in
the
case
of
a
great
storm,
their
coastline
has
been
washed
inland
by
the
action
of
the
storm
and
the
waves
to
take
off
as
much
a
half-a
mile
at
a
time.
we
have
an
island
on
the
shoreline
of
louisiana.
timbalier
island
has
actually
moved
sideways
and
northwestern
--
northwesterly,
positioned
nine
miles
such
the
state
entered
into
the
union.
it's
an
unusual
coastline.
louisiana
passed
laws
and,
throughout
its
history,
has
passed
laws
and
enforced
laws
not
only
leasing
the
bed
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
for
oysters
and
for
regulating
the
trawling
for
shrimp
and,
by
the
way,
shrimp
are
sedentary
fishes.
they
are
the
natural
resources
of
the
seabed
and
the
subsoil
according
to
many
definitions.
those
operations
go
40
and
50
miles
off
shore.
these
are
facts
your
honor
can
take
--
your
honors
can't
take
judicial
notice
of
all
these
facts.
we
think
there
is
enough
of
a
complication
here
in
the
coast
of
the
state
louisiana
and
in
the
manner
in
which
the
state
--
the
coast
of
the
state
has
been
occupied,
out
three
leagues
and
beyond
three
leagues
in
the
gulf
of
mexico,
makes
it
necessary
and
desirable
that
testimony
of
witnesses
be
taken
to
show
the
contemporaneous
construction
of
the
meaning
of
the
act
of
admission
of
louisiana
for
the
past
145
years
to
this
very
day.
that's
what
we
ask
for
in
our
motion
to
take
the
depositions
of
witnesses.
there
are
records
of
the
state,
the
various
departments
of
the
state,
there
are
testimony
of
living
witnesses.
there
are
also
treaties,
if
your
honors
please,
between
foreign
nations
relating
not
only
to
the
coast
of
louisiana
but
to
the
other
coasts
of
the
united
states
of
which
this
court
will
not
take
judicial
notice.
we
must
have
those
treaties
certified
as
true
and
correct
copies
and
filed
in
the
court
in
evidence.
we
think
that
the
type
of
testimony
that
needs
to
be
taken
in
this
court
or
in
the
courts
is
one
that
should
more
properly
call
for
a
thorough
investigation
and
hearing
of
the
case
by
a
district
judge
and
then
to
be
brought
up
to
this
court
in
a
logical
and
ordinary
way.
we
found
out
that
cases
of
that
kind
can
be
brought
up
here
a
lot
quicker
and
decided
a
lot
quicker
than
the
california
case
which
was
referred
to
a
master
almost
10
years
ago
and
hasn't
fully
been
decided
yet.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
i
don't
know
that
they
are.
now,
a
lot
of
treaties
are.
there
are
treaties
that
are
official
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
france
and
england
and
spain,
some
between
all
the
european
powers.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
preceding
the
admission
of
louisiana
to
the
union
and
all
of
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
none
of
those
treaties
are
less
provided
for
territorial
waters
less
than
three
leagues.
now,
i
say
territorial
waters.
it
wasn't
written
thus
--
just
those
themselves.
in
those
days,
the
great
value
of
territorial
waters
to
a
nation
was
the
fish
in
those
territorial
waters,
the
right
to
exclude
other
nationals
from
fishing
in
those
waters.
so,
of
necessity,
these
old
treaties
naturally
refer
largely
to
fishing.
some
of
them
refer
to
navigation,
too,
because,
of
course,
navigation
within
a
certain
distance
of
your
shore
can
make
a
pretext
for
taking
fish
and,
if
you
have
a
treaty
which
prohibits
that,
then
of
course,
you
want
to
also
prohibit
navigation
within
that
distance
from
your
shore,
except
by
permission.
i
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
that
is
occupation
and
possession,
if
your
honor
please,
of
the
bed
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
over
a
long
period
of
time.
that
makes
that
true.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
the
issue
is
the
extent
to
which
the
boundaries
of
louisiana
can
be
considered
to
have
extended
by
a
feature
of
this
very
act
of
admission.
we
--
we
can
--
we
can
take
the
act
of
admission
and,
from
that
act
of
admission,
we
can
prove
facts
that
will
show
a
proper
construction
of
that
act
to
mean
that
the
louisiana
boundary,
at
the
time
of
its
admission
to
the
union,
was
three
leagues
from
its
coast.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
i
do
not
state,
your
honor,
that
it
is
ambiguous.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
i
say
that
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
--
the
most
that
can
be
said
is
that
it
is
ambiguous,
and
i
will
turn
to
that.
that
is
on
--
the
enabling
act
for
louisiana
is
on
page
70
of
the
appendix
filed
by
louisiana.
the
act
of
admission
to
the
union
is
on
page
71
of
the
appendix.
the
enabling
act
describes
the
limits
of
louisiana.
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
portion
of
the
act
of
admission
here
that
describes
the
limits
other
than
by
reference
to
the
enabling
act.
in
the
enabling
act,
it
is
provided,
that
the
inhabitants
of
all
that
part
of
the
territory
or
country
ceded
under
the
name
of
louisiana
by
the
treaty
made
at
paris
on
the
30th
day
of
april,
1803
between
the
united
states
and
france
contained
within
the
following
limits.
that
is
to
say,
beginning
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
sabine,
and
thence
proceeding
up
the
sabine
river
to
the
33rd
parallel,
thence
over
to
the
mississippi
river,
thence
down
the
mississippi
river
and,
finally,
ending
up
about
the
sixth
line
from
the
bottom
of
the
page
here,
thence
bounded
by
the
said
gulf
to
the
place
of
beginning,
including
all
islands
within
three
leagues
of
the
coast.
the
only
reason
i
would
say
that
that
might
be
ambiguous
is
that
the
government
says
that
--
that
the
phrase
"including
all
islands
within
three
leagues
of
the
coast"
doesn't
include
all
submerged
lands
within
three
leagues
of
the
coast.
we
say
it
does
and
that
it
has
always
been
so
construed.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
yes,
sir.
quote
on
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
yes,
sir.
and,
the
only
proof
that
he
has
that
the
national
boundary
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
was
only
three
miles
is
a
letter
of
present
secretary
of
state
written
after
this
case
had
been
put
at
issue
and
supported
by
quotations
from
thomas
jefferson
that
i
have
read
here
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
--
and
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
i
don't
know
how
the
government
could
prove
that
the
limits
were
three
miles.
i
have
never
seen
any
treaty.
i
have
never
seen
any
law.
i
have
never
seen
any
statement
made
by
the
department
of
state
in
any
communication
that
the
international
boundary
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
was
only
three
miles.
on
the
contrary,
your
honor,
there
are
numerous
treaties
and
there
are
statements
by
the
department
of
state.
we
quote
them
in
our
brief
and
i
can
pick
them
up
in
detail.
that,
in
the
gulf
of
mexico,
the
international
boundary
was
three
leagues,
and
it
is
so
shown
on
maps
that
are
in
the
department
of
state,
maps
that
are
in
the
coast
and
geodetic
survey
offices,
surveys,
they're
shown
in
our
map
appendix
which
we
filed
here.
we
have
reproduced
and
filed
in
our
map
appendix
a
map
--
a
survey
made
that
shows
international
boundary.
a
line
drawn
three
leagues
into
the
coast
and
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
--
as
designated
international
boundary
in
three
leagues
and
it
would
even
tells
you
the
depth
at
the
end
of
that
line
is
27-and-three-tenths
fathoms
in
depth
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
it
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
right,
sir.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
we'll,
do
it.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
oh,
that's
right.
that's
right,
what
does
the
act
of
congress
mean,
and
i
doubt,
it
doesn't
foreclose
a
question
either
as
to
how
far
congress
can
go.
now,
on
the
matter
of
--
let
me
just
say,
while
we're
on
the
subject
of
the
boundaries
of
the
united
states,
i
think
when
your
honors
read
the
brief
and
consider
the
--
the
supporting
facts
in
the
brief
with
reference
to
the
matter,
that
a
boundary
of
the
united
states
has
been
extended
to
the
edge
of
the
continental
shelf.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
escape
it.
i
don't
see
how
the
provisions
of
the
outer
continental
shelf
act
that
was
passed
in
--
on
august
7,
1953
mean
anything
else.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
that
would
help
in
this
case
by
referring
to
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court
over
a
number
of
years,
wherein
this
court
has
repeatedly
and
consistently
held
that
the
boundaries
of
the
states
are
coterminous
with
the
boundaries
of
the
united
states
and,
in
the
continental
united
states,
the
united
states
owns
no
territory
beyond
the
boundaries
of
the
states.
now,
there
is
a
fine
question
there
as
to
who
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
--
as
to
who
goes
first.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
sir?
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
oh,
no
sir.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
oh,
no
sir.
i
do
not
say
the
united
states
cannot
do
that.
the
united
states
can
do
anything
permissible
by
international
law
and
of
course,
as
far
as
our
domestic
welfare
is
concerned,
it
may
disregard
international
law
and
go
out
to
the
middle
of
the
gulf
of
mexico.
if
it
owned
all
the
gulf
of
mexico,
like
philip
of
spain
back
in
1563,
philip
of
spain
claimed
and
owned
the
entire
gulf
of
mexico
because
spain
owned
the
entire
circumference
of
the
gulf
of
mexico.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
yes,
sir.
exactly,
sir.
that
is
right
and
that
is
what
this
court
has
said
many
times.
this
court
--
i
say
this
court,
of
course,
i
mean
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
has,
in
the
years
gone
by,
gone
further
than
that.
in
the
case
of
manchester
versus
massachusetts,
the
court
stated
that
the
states
of
the
united
states,
the
several
states,
insofar
as
their
boundaries
at
sea
were
concerned,
had
the
right,
same
rights
of
sovereignty
possessed
by
other
nations
of
the
world,
and
that
the
states
had
the
right
to
extend
their
boundaries
to
the
full
limit
permitted
by
international
law.
and,
that
statement
has
never
been
overruled
and
has
never
been
questioned
by
this
court,
unless
it
--
you
may
say
it
was
questioned
inferentially
by
your
honors
deciding
these
tidelands
cases.
you
didn't
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
inferentially,
yes,
sir.
it
--
it
could
not
stand
if
the
decisions
of
this
court
stand
in
the
california
case,
the
louisiana
case,
or
the
texas
case
decided
back
in
1940
and
1950,
respectively.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
there
were
hearings,
sir.
i
did
not
take
part
in
them
personally.
do
you
mean
did
louisiana
take
part?
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
no,
sir.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
sir,
i
am
sorry
to
say
they
were
not
made.
i
--
i
can
explain
why,
except
to
say
that
i've
been
studying
this
case
for
two
years
and
i
think
i
found
out
a
lot
of
facts
that,
perhaps,
they
hadn't
read
at
that
time.
i
--
i
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
i
don't
say
that
disparagingly
to
anybody
else,
but
i
do
say
that
this
--
this
problem
here
has
involved
quite
a
study
of
history
of
international
law,
constitutional
law,
domestic
law,
common
law.
the
whole
theory
of
our
constitutional
form
of
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
--
government
is
involved
in
this
question.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
oh,
yes.
there
--
there
were
statements
made
about
the
three-league
boundary
and
there
were
also
statements
made
that
--
by
governor
keenan,
as
i
recall,
that
the
boundaries
of
louisiana
went
--
that
louisiana
had
a
right
to
claim
the
whole
continental
shelf
at
that
time.
i
think
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
sir?
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
wherever
it
went
to,
yes.
i
--
i
must
confess,
your
honor,
that
there
was
some
lack
of
definiteness
and
certainty
in
the
argument.
i
wish
i
could
appear
before
the
congressional
committee
now.
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
i
--
i
mean
i
think
there's
a
lot
of
facts
that
have
--
we
have
ferreted
out.
in
this
case,
it
will
not
--
have
not
been
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
--
obtained
by
research
then.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
sir,
that
is
not
in
section
4.
just
a
minute,
who
got
my
act
here?
that's
not
in
section
4,
sir.
that's
in
section
3,
and
that
does
not
relate
to
the
state.
that
is
--
that,
if
any
it
has,
relates
to
the
title
of
the
united
states.
now,
let's
read
that.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
no,
sir.
it's
in
section
3.
here
is
what
it
says,
in
section
3
(b)
of
the
submerged
lands
act
--
what
page
is
that
on
in
our
appendix.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
i
--
i
--
i
won't
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
that's
not
--
that's
not
in
--
wait
a
minute,
now.
let
me
see.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
let
me
get
the
government's
brief.
where
is
it?
i
want
the
government's
brief.
i
--
i
didn't
catch
that
your
honor.
167?
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
yes,
i
see.
any
claim
--
it
is
in
both
places
your
honor.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
both
sections
3
and
4,
i'm
sorry.
now,
let
me
--
let
me
call
the
court's
attention
to
what
this
thing
means
because
i
think
some
confusion
here
has
been
engendered
by
--
by
maybe
our
answers
to
questions.
section
2
is
the
act
--
is
the
part
of
the
act
that
makes
the
definitions.
i
think
those
definitions
as
opposed
to
thereafter
applied,
or
whatever,
is
stated.
section
3
of
the
act
is
a
confirmatory.
now,
the
government
calls
it
a
grant.
we
say
that
that
is
a
part
of
the
act
that
confirms
the
preexisting
titles
of
the
state
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
admits
has
always
been
considered
as
the
properties
of
the
states.
in
that
section
3
and
on
section
4
is
the
saving
clause
or
the
proviso
with
regard
to
nothing
in
the
act
shall
--
nothing
in
this
act
shall
prejudice
the
right
of
any
state
to
prove
that
its
boundaries
are
more
than
three
miles
if,
at
the
time
or
if
prior
from
the
time
it
was
admitted
to
the
union,
it
was
so
provided
by
its
laws.
now,
let's
read
section
3.
section
3
(a)
declares
that
“it
is
the
public
interest
that
the
title
to
an
ownership
of
lands
beneath
navigable
waters
within
the
boundaries
of
the
states,
and
the
right
and
power
to
manage
the
same,
be
and
they
are
hereby
subject
to
the
provisions
hereof
recognized,
confirmed,
established,
invested
in,
and
assigned
to
the
respective
states.”
now,
let's
go
down
to
subparagraph
(b)
of
this
confirmatory
clause
which
is
section
3.
“the
united
states
hereby
releases
and
relinquishes,”
i
think
those
words
“releases
and
relinquishes”
are
the
kind
that
us
lawyers
down
my
way,
anyhow,
always
use
to
write
up
a
quick
claim
deal.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
you
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
no,
sir.
they
weren't
assigned.
they
--
i'll
tell
you
what
that
applies
to.
they
threw
that
in
for
good
measure,
your
honor,
and
section
2
(b)
--
section
3
(b)
will
show
you
the
reason
why.
“the
united
states
hereby
releases
and
relinquishes
onto
such
states
and
persons
aforesaid,
except
as
otherwise
reserved
herein,
all
right,
title,
and
interest
of
the
united
states,
if
any
it
has.”
congress
questioned
whether
the
united
states
had
any
right,
title,
or
interest
in
these
lands
which
it
was
relinquishing
and
releasing
to
the
sates
and
whose
title
it
was
confirming
and
establishing
and
recognizing
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
sir?
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
no,
sir.
there's
--
what
--
what
section
4
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
what
section
4
says
is,
now,
that
the
states
can
prove
their
title
beyond
three
miles,
if
any
they
have.
now,
that
brings
us
down
to
this
thing
here.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
that's
right.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
that's
right.
i
--
i
was
just
stating
it.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
congress
knew,
your
honor,
when
this
law
was
passed
--
when
these
laws
were
passed.
we
must
give
congress
credit
for
knowing
what
had
been
done
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
in
the
years
gone
by.
congress
must
have
known
that
the
laws
of
texas
provided
that
its
boundaries
were
three
leagues
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
it
must
have
known
that
the
boundaries
of
florida
were
three
leagues
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
it
must
have
known
that
the
enabling
act
and
the
act
of
admission
of
louisiana
and
its
constitution
which
was
approved
on
its
admission
into
the
union
provided
that
the
--
that
the
state
of
louisiana
was
contained
within
the
following
limits,
including
all
islands
within
three
leagues
of
its
coast.
it
must
have
known
of
those
things
and
this,
of
course,
if
your
honors
please,
was
a
compromise
measure.
i
believe
i
am
correct
in
stating
that,
back
in
1938
and
probably
again
in
1939,
there
was
an
effort
on
the
part
of
the
administration
to
have
congress
to
declare
that
the
submerged
lands
adjoining
the
coast
of
all
the
states
belonged
to
the
united
states,
and
congress
refused
to
do
that.
in
1948,
i
believe
it
was,
a
resolution
was
enacted
by
the
congress
and
passed
both
houses
wherein
it
recognized
the
states
owned
the
submerged
lands
offshore.
and,
i
don't
believe
there
was
any
limitation
in
that
resolution.
it
was
vetoed
by
the
president
and
it
failed
to
pass
over
his
veto.
then,
came
the
passage
of
the
submerged
lands
act
and
the
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
--
congress
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
i'd
like
to
put
it
in.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
in
those
decisions,
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
you're
right,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
unless
we
try
to
get
you
to
overturn
your
pre
--
prior
decisions
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
--
which
you
would,
perhaps,
refuse
to
do.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
yes.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
that's
right.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
yes,
sir.
well,
of
course,
we
can
come
a
whole
lot
closer
to
that
by
the
--
by
the
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
adhering
to
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
that
is
not
entirely
correct
your
honor.
i
--
i
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
i'll
be
good
enough
to
correct
you
then.
we
--
we
make
the
argument
here
in
our
brief
that
the
only
theory,
first,
of
course,
congress
--
congress
is
a
legislative
body.
congress
can
declare
whether
or
not
the
united
states
has
extraterritorial
rights
or
merely
territorial
rights.
that's
correct,
isn't
it?
now,
congress,
in
the
passage
of
these
acts,
reputed
entirely
any
claim
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
to
any
extraterritorial
rights
in
the
submerged
lands
and
waters
adjoining
the
shores
of
the
united
states
anywhere.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
so
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
yes,
that's
right.
government
had
no
standing
here.
that's
correct,
sir.
and
we
don't
think
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
oh,
yes.
oh,
yes
we
still
have
a
dual
system
of
sovereignty,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
oh,
that's
right.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
alright.
i'll
come
to
that.
that's
what
the
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
that's
what
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
that
congress
did,
your
honor,
in
the
cases
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
i
--
i
know
--
i
know
that
that
is
--
that
is
covered
thoroughly
in
our
--
in
our
briefs,
your
honor.
and,
i
will
try
to
pick
it
out
for
you
in
--
in
the
act
of
congress
and
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
of
congress.
it
was
contented
i'll
--
it
--
let
me
say
this.
the
--
the
department
of
justice
appeared
before
the
committees
of
congress
to
urge
that
the
three
miles
was
the
only
limit.
and
they
gave
all
the
testimony
that
is
now
contained
in
mr.
dulles'
letter
as
to
why
three
miles
was
the
extreme
limit
of
the
ownership
of
territorial
waters
and
submerged
lands.
congress
didn't
agree
to
that.
they
rejected
that
theory
by
saying
that,
if
we
think
it
is
possible
and
we
think
that
the
states
should
be
entitled
to
prove
that
their
boundaries
extended
more
than
three
miles
into
the
gulf,
and
if
they
did
extend
more
than
three
miles
into
the
gulf,
either
at
the
time
they
were
admitted
to
the
union
or
prior
thereto,
then
they
are
entitled
to
such
boundaries.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
oh,
yes.
yes,
certainly,
and
we
--
we
don't
--
we
joined
issue
with
the
government,
too,
in
its
assertion
that,
well,
they
make
the
statement
here
that
the
limit
was
set,
this
three-league
limit,
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
on
page
21
of
their
brief.
not
as
an
indication
that
congress
believed
that
such
limits
did
or
could
exist,
but
as
a
concession
to
the
demands
of
the
coastal
states.
well,
that
was
certainly
not
only
a
futile
proposition,
but
i
think
it
would
be
a
deceitful
proposition
if
a
provision
were
written
into
the
law
in
this
manner.
to
say
to
the
state,
“you
may
prove
that
you
have
a
three-league
boundary
but
we
know
you
can't
do
it
because
it
isn't
so.”
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
yes,
at
the
bottom
of
page
21
of
the
government's
brief,
it's
there.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
last
paragraph.
it's
this
reply
brief.
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
brief
of
the
united
states
in
reply
to
louisiana's
opposition
to
motion
for
judgment.
in
the
passage,
your
honor,
of
the
submerged
lands
act,
witnesses
appeared
before
the
committee
to
urge
that
what
congress
was
endeavoring
to
do
was
to
give
away
property
belonging
to
the
united
states
to
these
coastal
states.
they
said
that
this
was
a
gift
of
bounty
from
the
national
government
to
the
state
governments
and
that
the
nation
should
not
do
that
to
deprive
all
the
people
of
the
united
states
of
this
great
wealth
in
order
to
benefit
a
few
states.
the
congressional
committee,
in
reporting
--
favorably
reporting
the
senate
joint
resolution
which,
in
that
respect,
was
no
different
from
the
house
resolution
and
the
legislative
history
on
that
is
the
same,
specifically
stated
that
this
is
not
a
gift.
it
is
not
a
gift.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
it
merely
reconfirms
and
reestablishes
in
the
states
what
they
have
always
believed
that
they
have
owned
during
the
entire
nation's
history.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
well,
i
don't
think
that's
crucial.
no,
sir,
because
i
think
it's
--
i
think
it's
implicit
in
the
act
itself,
the
wording
of
the
act
of
the
recognition.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
under
your
court's
opinion,
that's
right,
sir.
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
no,
sir.
they
recognized
us
as
having
something
that
we
have
always
had
and
they
confirmed
and
recognized
and
established
our
title
thereto.
and,
the
word
“grant”
was
used
because
they
released
and
relinquished
onto
the
state
any
title
that
the
united
states
might
have,
if
any
it
has.
it
was
the
words
they
used
there.
and,
thereby,
in
the
act
itself,
questioning
as
to
whether
the
united
states
had
any
title.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
that's
correct,
sir.
and
that's
what
we've
asked
the
court
to
do
when
we
asked
to
take
the
depositions
in
the
case.
and
of
course,
that's
the
reason
we're
here,
now,
to
this
part
of
the
hearing.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
oh,
i
think
it
depends
on
that
too
your
honor.
of
course,
we
may
not
agree
on
that
point,
but
our
--
our
position
is
that
there's
a
great
deal
of
rationalization
here.
extraterritorial
rights
--
the
government,
here,
says
they
claim
extraterritorial
rights.
such
rights
appear
nowhere
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
they
appear
nowhere
in
any
law
except
such
extraterritorial
rights
as
exists
by
virtue
of
treaties,
and
extraterritorial
rights
are
mere
personal
rights
such
as
a
treaty
with
another
country
to
permit
the
passage
of
truth
through
that
treaty.
a
right
such
as
we
acquired
after
the
boxer
rebellion
in
china
to
have
our
nationals
tried
before
our
own
courts
for
offenses
committed
in
china.
those
are
extraterritorial
rights.
what
they
are
claiming
here
is
territorial
rights
because,
by
the
very
wording
of
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act,
the
territory
of
the
united
states,
the
jurisdiction
in
control
of
the
united
states,
the
power
of
disposition
over
the
seabed
and
the
subsoil
have
been
extended
to
the
edge
of
the
continental
shelf.
it
--
on
the
--
on
that
same
subject,
if
your
honors
please,
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
case
of
quintana
versus
--
superior
oil
company
versus
quintana,
the
case
where
the
state
of
louisiana
sought
to
impose
taxes
on
severance
--
severance
taxes
on
resource
that's
been
severed
from
the
soil,
this
was
within
the
three
--
within
three
miles
of
the
shores
of
the
state
of
louisiana.
the
court
sustained
the
right
of
the
state
of
louisiana
to
collect
taxes
on
lands,
on
resources
that
have
been
severed
from
the
soil
within
this
area
before
the
submerged
lands
act
ever
became
law.
the
court
said
that,
by
virtue
of
the
act,
public
law
number
31,
the
submerged
lands
act,
which
nullified
the
theory
on
which
the
opinion
and
the
decree
of
the
supreme
court
had
been
based,
they
must
be
held,
notwithstanding
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court,
to
have
always
and
at
all
times
had
the
title
and
right
of
possession
of
or,
if
the
passage
of
public
law
number
31
which
brought
the
long
struggle
to
an
end
is
to
be
regarded
as
then
confirmed
title
on
them,
this
title
by
the
very
terms
of
the
act
declaring
it
and
establishing
it
related
back
so
as
to
confirm
and
maintain
the
possession
and
title
of
the
state
and
the
lessee
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
--
as
good
from
the
beginning.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
this
is
an
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
now,
i
know
i
can't
assume
that
your
honors
approve
that
by
refusing
certiorari,
but
i
would
think
that,
perhaps,
this
court
didn't
violently
disagree
with
that
statement
because
it
did
refuse
certiorari
in
that
case.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
well,
sir
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
well,
sir,
as
i
see
it
--
as
we
see
it
and
the
position
we
take
of
course
is
directly
contrary
to
that
because
we
think
that
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
that's
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
that's
not
--
that's
not
the
end
of
our
position,
your
honor.
of
course
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
i
think
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
i
think
--
i
think
your
honor,
in
view
of
the
--
i
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
i
think,
in
view
of
the
acts
of
congress,
that
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
--
what
was
said
in
those
cases
(voice
overlap)
--
should
be
reconsidered.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
no,
not
in
section
4
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
we
got
two
acts
here,
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
is
the
other.
and
the
legislative
history
behind
both
of
these
acts
are
what
indicate
that
it
was
a
confirmation
of
title
and
a
recognition
of
title
rather
than
a
grant
of
title
and
rather
than
a
gift
of
title
because
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
i
say
that
it
should
be
reconsidered,
your
honor.
now,
i
would
like
to
go
on
with
the
argument
here
as
to
the
three
leagues,
whether
or
not
louisiana
is
entitled
to
three
leagues
or
merely
three
miles
from
its
coast.
in
the
case
of
louisiana
versus
mississippi,
the
boundary
line
between
louisiana
and
mississippi
was
in
issue
before
this
court.
and,
in
that
case,
while
this
court
did
not
decide
the
limit
of
territorial
waters,
it
did
say
that
louisiana's
southern
boundary
was
a
water
boundary.
now,
the
act
of
admission
of
louisiana
described
it
as
a
water
boundary
and
when
it
says
that
it
was
contained
within
the
following
limits,
that
is,
including
all
islands
within
three
leagues
of
its
coast.
this
court,
in
this
--
in
this
case,
said
that
that
was
a
water
boundary.
if
it
were
not
a
water
boundary
then,
by
implication,
the
act
of
admission
would
have
included
the
submerged
lands
and
territorial
waters
adjoining
the
coast
of
louisiana
by
implication.
that
has
been
stated
in
numerous
decisions
of
this
court.
the
united
states
has
consistently
approved
the
three-league
boundary
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
in
a
treaty
with
spain
--
now,
the
treaties
that
we
enter
into,
your
honors,
i
think
are
--
we
refer
to
treaties
as
matter
of
common
usage
between
nations
as
a
basis
for
international
law.
we
entered
into
a
treaty
with
spain
on
february
22nd,
1819
defining
the
boundaries,
beginning
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
at
the
mouth
of
the
sabine
river.
a
similar
treaty
was
made
with
mexico
in
1828.
in
1838,
the
united
state
entered
into
a
convention
with
the
state
of
texas
for
the
marking
of
the
boundary
between
the
united
states
and
texas.
and,
notes
to
that
treaty
by
the
department
of
state
show
that,
in
the
--
in
the
agreement
for
the
marking
of
that
boundary,
both
the
department
of
state
of
the
united
states
and
the
foreign
office
of
--
or,
rather,
the
representatives
of
the
republic
of
texas
agreed
that
they
were
bound
by
the
prior
treaties
that
had
been
made
with
spain
and
mexico,
and
that
the
boundary
of
texas
was
three
leagues
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
subsequently,
in
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo,
in
1840
--
in
1848,
the
united
states
and
mexico
agreed
upon
an
international
boundary
in
the
gulf
of
mexico,
beginning
three
leagues
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
opposite
the
mouth
of
the
rio
grande
and,
thence,
on
over
to
the
pacific
ocean
some-2000
miles.
in
the
gadsden
treaty,
in
1853,
the
same
boundary
was
reconfirmed
as
being
three
leagues
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
subsequent
treaties
were
entered
into
in
1882
with
texas,
in
18
--
i
mean,
with
mexico
1882,
1884,
and
1905
wherein
this
boundary
was
reaffirmed.
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
recognized
that
territorial
limits
of
the
states
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
extend
three
leagues.
in
the
case
of
florida,
of
course,
florida's
constitution
was
approved
as
being
three
leagues
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
in
1906,
congress
passed
an
act
prohibiting
the
taking
of
sponges
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
that
was
the
case
of
the
abby
dodge
versus
the
united
states
where
the
crew
of
--
the
captain
of
abby
dodge
or
the
owner
of
the
abbey
dodge
was
indicted.
and
the
courts
specifically
held
in
that
case
that
the
indictment
did
not
negative
the
fact
that
the
taking
of
these
sponges
was
within
the
territorial
waters
of
the
state
of
florida.
subsequent
to
that
decision,
in
1914,
congress
passed
another
law
regulating
the
taking
of
sponges
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
beyond
the
territorial
limits
of
the
states.
now,
i
think
all
those
--
all
those
treaties
and
all
those
acts
of
congress,
if
your
honors
please,
recognizing
the
three-league
boundaries
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
are
to
be
considered
in
interpreting
the
boundaries
of
the
state
of
louisiana
and
in
accordance
with
the
submerged
lands
act
as
a
part
of
our
proof
that
we
are
entitled
to
that
boundary.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
i
won't
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
you
can
take
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
you
can
take
judicial
notice
of
these
boundaries
of
course
because
they
are
in
treaties
executed
by
the
united
states,
and
these
recognitions
are
in
acts
of
congress.
now,
briefly,
in
closing
this
part
of
the
case
in
order
that
i
may
reserve
a
little
time
for
reply,
i
want
to
remark
with
regard
to
the
equal
footing
clause
and
the
admission
of
the
state
of
louisiana.
in
the
case
of
united
states
versus
texas,
your
honors
will
recall,
it
was
assumed
that
if
texas'
boundaries
were
three
leagues
in
the
gulf
of
mexico,
the
court
could
not
recognize
that
because
that
would
admit
texas
on
a
footing
that
was
equal
with
the
other
states.
now,
by
that
same
token
--
by
that
same
token,
to
provide
here
or
to
permit
here
the
other
states
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
to
have
boundaries
three
leagues
offshore
is
to
deny
to
louisiana
the
equal
dignity
and
equal
standing
and
the
equal
sovereignty
with
the
other
states
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
it
is
perfectly
proper
for
the
congress
to
say
that
the
boundaries
may
extend
three
leagues
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
but,
by
the
equal
footing
provision,
we
are
entitled
to
the
same
and,
certainly,
in
consideration
of
that
equal
footing
provision,
this
court
should
construe
the
act
admitting
louisiana
into
the
union
in
1812
in
the
same
like
that
the
other
states'
boundaries
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
are
considered.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
we
would
like
to
--
sir?
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
the
government
challenges
that
statement
on
the
grounds
that
we
--
that
texas
and
florida
came
into
the
union
after
louisiana
was
admitted.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
no,
sir.
they
are
not
insisting
that.
that
is
implicit
in
the
act.
now,
we're
discussing
the
act,
your
honor.
you
desire
that
i
adhere
to
that
act,
and
i'm
discussing
that
act
now
and
that
act
unmistakably
--
that
act,
although
mistakably,
recognizes
texas
and
florida
and
any
other
states
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
i
say,
explicitly
does,
i
mean
you
can't
read
the
act
and
you
can't
read
the
laws
of
these
states
without
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
it
does
recognize
three-league
boundaries
in
the
gulf
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
--
for
those
states.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
three
leagues
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
yes.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
it
gives
them
the
right
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
that
is
the
language
of
the
act
that
says
“if
it
was
so
provided
by
its
laws
at
the
time
of
or
prior
to
the
admission
to
the
union,”
and
in
the
definition
of
boundaries.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
no,
the
national
boundary
goes
to
the
edge
of
the
continental
shelf,
your
honor.
and,
our
argument
is
that
the
national
boundary
has
always
been
declared
to
be
three
leagues
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
there
is
not
a
single
act
of
congress
or
a
single
treaty
that's
ever
said
it
was
three
miles,
never.
and
this
act
recognizes
the
fact
--
this
act
recognizes
the
fact
that
there
are
laws
which
may
provide
that
the
boundaries
of
states
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
go
to
three
leagues
and
it
sends
us
to
this
court,
in
effect,
to
have
this
court
to
determine
that
factor,
as
to
whether
not
that
is
a
fact.
and
louisiana's
boundaries
read
“within
the
limit
of
three
leagues,”
but
they
do
not
read
the
same
as
the
texas
and
the
florida
act.
i
think
the
texas
and
the
florida
acts
clearly
read
three-leagues
boundaries
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
and
when
you
read
the
submerged
lands
act
and
when
you
read
the
laws
of
these
states,
i
think
the
--
the
conclusion
is
inescapable,
but
their
boundaries
are
three
leagues
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
and
the
right
to
be
maintained
on
an
equal
sovereignty
over
these
states
is
not
limited
to
the
date
of
admission
of
the
state
into
the
union.
this
court
had
so
--
said
so.
if
that
were
so,
you
could
produce
an
inequality,
indignity,
in
sovereignty
between
the
states
instead
in
maintaining
the
equality
of
sovereignty
that
they
are
entitled
to.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
our
time.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
in
the
gulf
of
mexico,
yes,
sir,
and
i
--
i
began
my
argument
with
the
statement
that
the
gulf
of
mexico
is
different
from
the
atlantic
and
pacific
oceans
and,
of
course,
the
act
makes
the
difference.
it's
a
reasonable
classification.
in
the
great
lakes,
the
international
boundary
goes
to
the
middle
of
the
great
lakes,
50.
well,
lake
curran
has
an
average
width
of
177
miles.
so
the
boundaries
of
the
states
on
--
the
international
boundary
of
the
states
on
lake
curran
go
out
77
miles.
and
the
court
has
always
said
what
is
true,
that
these
are
great
inland
seas.
because
they
are
inland
seas,
it
is
reasonable
to
classify
them
differently
from
the
atlantic.
because
the
gulf
of
mexico
is
also
more
or
less
of
an
enclosed
sea,
it
may
be
classified
differently
and
it
may
be
provided
there,
reasonably,
that
the
limit
may
be
three
leagues
if
the
state
can
so
prove
it.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
yes.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
only
in
a
general
way,
your
honor.
of
course,
i
couldn't
--
i
would
have
to
give
the
testimony.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
the
manner
in
which
the
act
of
admission
of
louisiana,
the
--
the
wording
of
the
act
admitting
louisiana
into
the
union
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
we
don't
have
to
have
evidence
on
that,
unless
the
court
should
say
that
that
wording
is
ambiguous
and,
in
order
to
show
what
the
wording
means,
we
are
entitled
to
show
the
contemporary
and
long
continued
construction
given
to
this
boundary
of
louisiana.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir,
the
testimony
--
some
of
that
testimony
of
witnesses,
of
course,
the
testimony
of
living
witnesses
can
only
go
back
for
the
past
50,
maybe,
or
60
years
at
the
most.
documents
in
the
state
land
office
and
the
mineral
board
and
documentary
evidence
and
records
in
the
state
capital
at
baton
rouge,
your
honors
don't
take
judicial
notice
of
those
things.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
other
than
the
testimony
of
witnesses,
the
records
of
the
state
department
--
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
that's
right,
on
those
points.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
other
than
documentary
evidence
and
records
of
the
state
offices,
i
--
i
know
of
nothing
else.
do
you?
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
sir?
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
yes.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
yes.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
of
course
testimony
of
this
--
i
mean,
the
--
this
evidence
to
show
that
united
states
has
recognized,
and
the
united
states
has
to
prove
our
act
of
admission
as
meaning
three
leagues,
just
as
the
state
of
louisiana
has
construed
it
over
these
145
years.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
scott
wilkinson
my
relevant
evidence
means
that
we
are
entitled
to
three
leagues
from
coast
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
that's
what
the
evidence
will
show.
