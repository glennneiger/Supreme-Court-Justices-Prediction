mr.

justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
solicitor,
as
i
understand
you
now,
let's
see
if
i
can
get
the
grasp
of
this
case.
in
united
states
against
louisiana,
this
court
held
that
the
state
of
louisiana
had
no
proprietary
rights
beyond
the
low
mean
water
mark
seaward.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
the
only
grant
of
any
proprietary
interest,
after
it
was
made
by
congress,
is
found
in
section
2
of
the
submerged
lands
act,
is
it
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
what
is
found,
if
there
are
other
rights,
dealt
with
in
section
4
depending
upon
--
they
are
dependent
upon
other
principles,
aren't
they
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
sections
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
section
3
and
definition
is
in
2,
correct.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
what
section
4
deals
with
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
grant
of
any
proprietary
interest.
it
simply
says,
in
fact,
that
we
make
no
question
about
nor
do
we
prejudice
by
this
grant
any
other
rights
under
other
principles.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
oh
yes.
oh
yes,
well,
that's
the
grant
that's
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
given
expressly
by
the
act.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
they
had
a
right
to
go
out,
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
if
therefore
louisiana
has
any
rights
beyond
the
three
miles,
they
depend
upon
principles
wholly
foreign
to
this
statute
or
to
any
rights
granted
by
the
statute.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
yes
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
would
that,
in
turn,
mr.
solicitor,
have
the
effect
of
extending
the
international
boundary
of
the
country,
extending
our
sea
with
boundary
of
the
country?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
is
that
within
the
power?
first,
is
it
not
true,
it
seems
obvious
to
me,
that
a
state
cannot
be
partly
within
and
partly
without
the
union?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
they
do
so,
isn't
it
your
claim
that
you
stand
in
the
southern
boundary
of
louisiana
a
bargaining?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
is
also
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
the
language
--
the
quick
language
here,
down
right,
were
just
assigned?
