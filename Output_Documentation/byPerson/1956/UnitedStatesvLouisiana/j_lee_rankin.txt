mr.
j.
lee
rankin
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
the
united
states
is
entitled,
as
against
the
state
of
louisiana,
to
the
lands,
minerals,
and
other
things
underlying
the
gulf
of
mexico,
lying
more
than
three
geographic
miles
seaward
from
the
ordinary
low
water
mark
and
from
the
outer
limit
of
inland
waters
on
the
coast
of
louisiana
and
extending
seaward
to
the
edge
of
the
continental
shelf.
it
presents
the
further
question
of
whether
united
states
is
entitled
to
an
accounting
by
the
state
of
louisiana
for
all
sums
of
money
derived
by
the
state
from
june
5th,
1950,
the
date
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
the
other
case,
from
such
lands
and
minerals.
united
states
alleges
in
the
complaint
that
it
is
entitled
to
a
judgment
for
the
property
described,
lying
seaward
from
the
low
water
mark,
inland
waters,
that
the
question
is
res
judicata
by
reason
of
the
prior
opinion
of
the
court,
june
1950,
and
the
decree
by
this
court
of
december
11th,
1950
that
the
rights
of
the
united
states
were
modified
to
the
extent
of
the
provisions
of
the
submerged
lands
act
passed
by
the
congress
which
gave
the
states
the
right
to
the
lands
within
three
miles
of
the
baseline
below
water
--
low
water
mark
or
a
right
to
the
lands
in
three
leagues
but
no
more
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
providing
they
had
a
historic
boundary
for
such
three
leagues
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
either
at
the
time
they
entered
the
union
or,
if
it
was
approved
by
act
of
congress,
on
or
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
act
on
may
22nd,
1953.
the
united
states
alleges
that
it's
being
interfered
with
in
the
operation
of
the
properties
in
the
area
described
by
the
state
of
louisiana
that
it
does
not
have
any
relief
--
adequate
relief
except
in
this
court.
it
goes
on
to
describe
the
nature
of
the
interference,
the
fact
that
louisiana
brought
an
action
against
the
united
states
in
the
state
courts
of
louisiana
in
which
it
sought
to
enjoin
the
further
leasing
and
development
of
the
area,
and
that
that
action
was
enjoined
by
this
court
and
that
later,
a
stipulation
was
entered
into
in
accordance
with
the
order
of
this
court
whereby
the
properties
might
be
developed
and
limited
leasing
provided
for
by
an
agreement
filed
with
this
court
until
this
matter
could
be
determined.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right,
mr.
justice.
louisiana
alleges
a
series
of
defenses,
first,
a
general
denial,
and
then,
supplementary
allegations
to
support
that
general
denial
and
altogether,
eight
separate
defenses.
seven
of
the
defenses,
i
will
deal
with
later
in
seriatim
as
i
reach
them
in
the
argument.
the
principal
defenses
in
the
--
as
pertinent
to
their
argument
and
general
denial
are,
first,
that
the
submerged
lands
act
nullified
the
decree
of
this
court
by
the
action
of
the
congress,
in
that
--
by
that
congressional
act,
the
congress
interpreted
the
decree
of
the
court
and
determined
that,
instead
of
--
of
the
united
states
acquiring
the
property
in
the
manner
the
court
decreed
that
it
was
always
the
right
of
the
states
to
have
the
property
which
was
the
subject
of
the
submerged
lands
act
and
therefore,
they
were
--
it
was
less
in
the
nature
of
a
quick
claim
or
a
grant
but
merely
giving
to
the
states
what
they
had
already
had
for
a
period
since
the
beginning
of
the
country.
they
alleged
that
the
restrictions
on
the
state
boundaries
are
unconstitutional,
that
the
territorial
boundary
included
the
continental
shelf,
that
the
state
always
had
a
title
to
the
submerged
lands,
that
the
boundary
of
louisiana
always
was
the
same
as
the
united
states
since
the
treaty
of
paris
of
1803
when
we
acquired
the
louisiana
purchase.
that
by
the
louisiana
acts
of
1938
to
1954,
they
acquired
the
right
to
all
of
the
land
in
the
submerged
area
from
the
cost
guard
line
to
0.3
leagues
beyond
that,
in
the
gulf,
but
they
exercise
jurisdiction
under
claims
of
right
since
1949,
and
they
are
entitled
to
judgment.
the
position
of
the
united
states
is
that
the
judgment
and
decree
of
this
court
is
res
judicata
as
to
all
of
the
elements
except
what
was
carved
out
by
the
congress
in
the
submerged
lands
act
of
1953.
that
there
is
no
genuine
issue
of
fact
or
of
law
before
this
court
at
this
time
in
the
pleadings
presented
by
the
parties,
that
the
court
takes
judicial
notice
of
its
own
decrees
of
the
fact
that
the
political
branches
of
the
government
have
determined
since
1793
that
the
maritime
boundary
of
the
united
states
is
only
three
miles,
three
nautical
miles.
and
therefore,
no
state
could
possibly
have
a
boundary
beyond
that
of
the
united
state
as
a
maritime
boundary
on
any
coast
including
the
gulf.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
or
not
the
united
states
is
entitled
to
all
of
the
area
beyond
the
three-mile
belt
--
maritime
belt
on
the
gulf
outlying
beyond
the
low
water
mark
from
the
boundaries
of
the
state
of
louisiana
touching
the
gulf.
and
the
contention
of
louisiana
is
that
they
are
entitled
to
a
belt
of
three
leagues
measured
in
various
manners
out
from
the
--
either
the
coast
guard
line
or
the
inland
waters
as
measured
in
various
ways.
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i'm
sorry.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
there
are
certain
materials
that
the
court
will
have
to
look
at,
which
it
takes
judicial
notice
of
in
the
contention
of
the
united
states.
and
taking
those
various
cases
and
actions
of
this
court,
and
the
actions
of
the
political
branches
of
the
government
over
the
years,
and
the
issues
as
defined,
and
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
tidelands
cases
or
the
u.s.against
louisiana
prior
to
this
date,
that
there
is
no
issue
of
fact
or
law
that
is
material
or
has
any
substance
before
this
court.
and
the
united
states
is,
therefore,
entitled
to
judgment
for
the
determination
that
the
belt
of
maritime
--and
the
maritime
belt
that
louisiana
is
entitled
to
is
three
miles
and
not
three
leagues.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
you
--
you
look
at
the
act,
first,
to
determine
what
congress
granted
by
reason
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
and
then,
secondly,
in
interpreting
that
act
or
applying
that
act,
congress
said
they
were
entitled.
all
the
states
of
the
union
were
entitled
where
they
bordered
upon
the
ocean
to
three
miles
except
that,
in
the
gulf
of
mexico,
if
they
had
a
historic
boundary
which,
at
the
time
they
entered
the
union,
extended
three
leagues
or
was
approved
by
congress
at
anytime
prior
to
may
22nd,
1953,
the
date
of
the
act,
giving
them
three
leagues
in
the
gulf
of
mexico,
they
could
have
up
to
three
leagues.
otherwise,
they
only
got
the
three
miles.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
think
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
think
not.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
because
of
this
reason,
that
whatever
the
united
states'
position
was
with
regard
to
its
maritime
belt,
it's
binding
upon
every
state
in
the
union
regardless
of
any
claims
that
it
might
have
had.
for
instance,
in
the
case
of
--
for
different
reasons,
in
the
case
of
u.s.against
texas,
the
court
said
that
assuming,
they
didn't
examine
the
question
but
assuming
that
texas
had
a
three-league
boundary
in
the
gulf.
when
it
entered
the
union,
it
obtained
a
“no
submerged
lands”
because
of
the
fact
that
it
entered
on
the
same
basis
as
every
other
state,
so
that
the
--
the
maritime
boundary
of
the
united
states
can
only
be
fixed
by
the
united
states.
no
state
can
possibly
fix
it
is
the
position
of
the
united
states.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
don't
think
it
is
in
this
particular
case.
i
was
pointing
to
it
just
as
an
illustration
of
the
proposition
that
the
historic
boundary
of
the
state
of
louisiana
could
not,
according
to
the
contention
of
the
united
states,
extend
beyond
that
of
the
united
states.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
congress
was
very
careful
not
to
recognize
rights
in
anyone
in
connection
with
this
legislation,
any
state.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
--
it
was
giving
them
an
opportunity.
if
they
were
able
to
prove
that
they
in
fact
did
have
such
a
historic
boundary,
that
they
could
come
into
court
and
prove
it.
and
that
was
the
discussion
by
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
legal
consequence,
if
you
assume
that
they
could
prove
that
there
was
any
element
of
a
historic
boundary
that
they
had
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
before
they
entered
the
union,
then
it
is
the
contention
of
the
united
states
that
they
were
bound
by
the
political
determination
of
the
united
states
as
to
what
their
limit
was
at
all
times
from
the
moment
they
entered
the
union.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
that
derives
from
the
sovereign
power
of
the
united
states.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
the
exception
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
exception
was
recognized,
during
the
handling
of
the
legislation
in
the
congress,
as
giving
them
an
opportunity
to
examine
the
question
of
what
their
historic
boundary
was
in
the
courts.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
to
try
to
prove
that
they
had
some
prior
rights
which
they
claimed
and
the
congress
did
not
see
fit
to
undertake
to
say
that
the
political
boundary
of
the
maritime
belt
of
the
united
states
has
always
been
three
miles.
and
they
said,
“we're
entitled
to
have
that
examined
in
the
courts
like
the
courts
examined
many
other
questions
of
boundaries
and
determine
what
the
fact
is.”
and
it
was
also
presented
to
the
congress,
at
the
time,
in
detail
by
the
state
department
that
the
maritime
belt
of
the
united
states
had
been
held,
time
after
time,
by
the
political
branches
of
the
government
to
be
three
miles
and
no
more,
and
the
congress
was
well
aware
of
that.
so,
they
were
--
they
were
allowing
every
state
to
have
a
three-mile
belt
in
accordance
with
the
history
of
the
position
of
the
country
from
1793.
and
they
said
to
the
states
in
the
gulf,
“if
you
can
prove
that
you
had
a
historic
boundary
because
of
all
these
various
claims
you've
made,
despite
the
position
of
the
united
states,
you're
entitled
to
it
but
you
have
to
deal
with
this
position
of
the
united
states,
too.
and
the
courts
will
have
to
determine
whether
it's
possible
for
you
to
have
any
boundary
beyond
what
the
united
states
has.”
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
--
that's
our
understanding
of
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
is
our
understanding
of
the
issue.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
thought
i
answered
the
same
question
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
the
last
question.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
thought
that
was
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
--
i
am
sorry.
i
answered
the
question
wrong
then,
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
because
i
--
what
i'm
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
i
try
to
compare
the
two
inquiries,
the
act
does
not
say
that
they
can
prove
that.
it
says
that
nothing
that
the
act
does
shall
affect
it
but
if
they
prove
all
of
these
things
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
nothing
--
i'll
refer
you
to
pages
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
167.
the
part
that
is
--
has
a
bearing
as
to
the
area
beyond
three
geographical
miles
is
the
last
sentence.
the
part
set
out
in
section
4.
nothing
in
this
section
is
to
be
construed
as
questioning
or,
in
any
manner,
prejudicing
the
existing
--
the
existence
of
any
state's
seaward
boundary
beyond
three
geographical
miles
if
it
was
so
provided
by
its
constitutional
laws
prior
to
what
the
time
such
state
became
member
of
the
union
or
if
it
has
been
heretofore
approved
by
congress.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
under
the
law,
it
would
make
no
difference
because,
by
reason
of
the
decision
of
this
court
and
by
the
action
of
the
political
branches
in
determining
that
we
could
only
have
an
area
for
the
boundary
of
the
united
states
of
three
geographical
miles,
no
state
could
have
a
boundary
beyond
that.
and
therefore,
there
is
no
issue
because
the
court
would
take
judicial
notice
of
that.
it,
by
any
number
of
decisions,
has
held
that
it
is
bound
by
the
action
of
the
political
branches
in
determining
the
boundary
of
the
unite
states,
we
think
there
is
--
could
be
no
issue
as
to
the
fact
the
state
cannot
have
a
boundary
beyond
that
at
the
united
states
and
therefore,
there
can
be
no
question
that
would
be
--
would
not
be
material.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
now
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
the
position
of
the
united
states.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
now,
in
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it's
very
possible
that
they
could
because
congress
is
also
a
political
branch.
it's
acting
in
that
sphere
and
it
has
certain
control
over
the
problems
of
questions
of
foreign
relations,
too.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
could
if
it
intended
to
do
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
now
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
now,
the
particular
part
in
regard
to
the
boundary
that
the
court
is
asking
about
is
section
2
(b).
the
term
“boundaries”
includes
the
seaward
boundaries
of
the
state
or
its
boundaries
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
or
any
of
the
great
lakes
as
they
existed
at
the
time
such
date
it
became
a
member
of
the
union
or
as
hereto
--
excuse
me,
it's
165,
or
is
heretofore
approved
by
the
congress
or
as
extended
or
confirmed
pursuant
to
section
4
hereof.
but
in
no
event
shall
the
term
“boundaries”
or
the
term
“lands”
beneath
navigable
waters
be
interpreted
as
extending
from
the
coastline
more
than
three
geographical
miles
into
the
atlantic
ocean
or
the
pacific
ocean
or
more
than
three
marine
leagues
into
the
gulf
of
mexico.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
then
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
nature
of
the
grant
is
set
forth
in
section
2
based
upon
the
boundary
of
each
state.
all
lands
permanently
or
periodically
covered
by
tidal
waters
up
to

not
above
the
line
of
mean
high
tide
in
describing
the
lands
that

subject
of
the

a
later

seaward
to
align
three
geographical
miles
distant
from
the
coastline
of
each
such
state
and
to
the
boundary
line
of
each
such
state,
so
that
the
test
is
what
was
the
boundary
of
the
state
where,
in
any
case,
such
boundary
as
it
existed,
at
the
time
such
state
become
a
member
of
the
union
or
as
heretofore
approved
by
congress
extends
seaward
or
into
the
gulf
of
mexico
beyond
three
geographical
miles.
when
the
legislation
was
before
the
congress,
there
is
a
considerable
legislative
history
about
what
was
intended
by
this
particular
language.
and
senator
cordon,
at
the
time,
was
the
man
in
charge
of
the
bill
for
the
senate.
and
the
bill
that
was
finally
adopted
was
largely
that
of
the
senate
because
the
house
bill
was
entirely
substituted
by
the
senate
bill
as
the
final
bill
that
was
passed.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
is
not
a
power,
part
of
the
power,
or
the
duty
of
the
congress
to
make
determination
with
reference
to
those
boundaries
or
where
those
boundaries
should
lie.
it
is
a
matter
for
the
courts
to
determine
or
for
the
united
states,
through
congress
and
the
legislative
organization
of
the
several
states
to
reach
an
agreement
upon.
the
pending
bill
does
not
seek
to
invade
either
problems.
it
leaves
both
exactly
where
it
finds
them.
whenever
a
question
arises
as
to
a
boundary,
it
will
be
determined
exactly
as
any
question
of
law
is
determined
and
the
boundary
will
be
established.
the
pending
measure
does
not
seek
to
prejudge
that
issue
or
to
determine
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
last
statement
from
mr.
justice
is
correct,
in
regard
to
what
is
controlling.
however,
when
you
say
that
the
boundary
that
louisiana
might
have
had
before
him
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
immaterial.
and
what
it
had,
before
hand
because
the
congress
didn't
say
whatever
they
had
“before
they
entered
the
union.”
it
says
“at
the
time
they
entered
the
union.”
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
in
--
except,
in
that,
you
would
--
in
our
contention,
the
united
states
would
have
to
say
that
the
boundary
of
any
state
of
a
nation
cannot
extend
beyond
that
of
the
united
states.
and
in
finding
what
the
boundary
of
the
state
is,
you
would
look
to
see
whatever
their
claims
were
and
say
it
can't
be
beyond
three
miles
no
matter
what.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
same
statement
was
made
by
mr.
holland
senator
from
florida,
who
had
a
great
interest
in
this
legislation
in
connection
with
his
state,
and
their
claim
to
three
leagues.
a
similar
statement
was
made
by
mr.
--
by
senator
long
from
louisiana
where
he
said,
“the
pending
measure
does
not
give
to
texas,
florida,
or
louisiana
anything
more
than
a
boundary
three
miles
out.
it
gives
--
that
merely
gives
them
the
right
to
prove,
if
prove
they
can,
that
the
boundary,
that
is
state
boundary,
i
am
interpolating,
goes
beyond
three
miles.
a
similar
statement
was
made
by
senator
keagle
of
california.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
was
impossible
to
prove
that,
at
the
time
they
entered
the
union,
they
could
have
any
boundary
beyond
three
miles
because
they
couldn't
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
would
be
impossible,
according
to
the
government's
contention,
that
any
state
could
prove
that,
at
the
moment
it
entered
the
union,
it
had
any
boundary
beyond
three
miles
because
that
was
the
historic
position
of
the
united
states
by
the
political
branches
and
it
was
binding
upon
the
united
states,
and
every
state
of
the
union
would
be
bound
by
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
there
are
some
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
seems
quite
clear
in
the
legislative
history
that
it
did
not
intend,
in
any
way,
to
change
the
rights
of
the
parties
in
that
regard.
but
it
was
contended
that
the
government
suggested,
during
the
legislative
history,
that
congress
should
try
to
fix
the
line,
and
it
was
suggested
by
those
of
the
gulf
states
that
congress
should
not
try
to
fix
any
line
but
leave
them
on
whatever
rights
they
could
establish
in
the
courts
by
reason
of
the
history.
and
then,
congress
saw
fit
to
take
a
measure,
that
was,
whatever
their
boundary
of
the
state
was
at
the
time
they
entered
the
union
which
necessarily,
according
to
government's
contention,
limited
them
to
whatever
the
boundary
of
the
united
states
was.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
government
believes
that
would
be
the
only
way
that
any
state
could
satisfactorily
show
that
they
had
a
boundary
that
was
beyond
three
miles.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
is
not
the
accepted
--
so
that
it
is
clearly
accepted.
it
--
there
are
contentions
by
louisiana
that
the
united
states
recognized
the
boundary
of
texas
as
being
the
three
leagues
at
one
time,
that
it
recognized
a
three-league
boundary
between
mexico
and
the
state
of
texas
in
connection
with
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
as
far
as
the
state
of
louisiana
is
concerned,
it
isn't
that
clear,
mr.
justice
because
they
say
that
the
boundary
of
the
united
states
is
established
by
the
relationships
between
the
political
branch,
the
state
department,
and
the
president
in
saying
what
our
boundary
is
and
what
we
recognized
and
the
action
over
the
years.
and
they
say
by
and
despite
the
history
which
dates
back
to
1793
with
president
jefferson.
and
case
after
case,
including
a
letter
to
senator
connolly
by
the
state
department
within
the
very
recent
period
in
which
the
state
department
says
the
united
states
has
never
recognized
the
three-league
boundary
in
the
gulf
and
thus,
it
didn't
recognize,
at
that
time,
that
if
--
the
reference
was
merely
for
the
purpose
to
protect
smuggling
and
nothing
more.
and
the
traditional
position
of
the
united
states
has
always
been
that
the
boundary
of
the
united
states
--
maritime
boundary
is
three
miles
and
nothing
else.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
despite
all
of
that,
they
say,
“well,
the
united
states
recognized
this
about
three
leagues
for
texas
and
mexico
and
therefore,
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
that's
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct.
and
if
they
could
say
that
this
correspondents,
which
is
a
matter
of
judicial
notice
to
this
court,
and
the
treaties,
and
these
various
things
were
in
fact
a
recognition
by
the
united
states
of
three
leagues,
so
that
the
boundary
of
the
united
states
in
the
gulf
was
in
fact
three
leagues
instead
of
three
miles,
they
would
have
an
issue
that
this
court
would
have
to
determine
whether
it
was
three
leagues
or
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
three
miles.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
think
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
think
it
would
be
fair
to
them
to
say
that
they
agree
that
three
miles
is
the
limit.
it
is
the
position
of
the
united
states
that
the
records,
and
the
treaties,
and
the
action
of
the
state
department
is
so
clear
that
no
one
could
construe
it
otherwise,
but
they
do
try
to
construe
it.
and
we
think
that
the
court
takes
judicial
notice
of
those
various
papers
and
documents
and
in
construing
them,
could
only
arrive
at
the
one
conclusion.
and
then,
furthermore,
we
have
the
letter
of
secretary
dulles
in
reviewing
the
entire
matter
which
is
set
forth
in
appendix
b,
page
176,
june
15th,
1956.
and
he
reviews
the
entire
history
in
regard
to
the
position
of
the
united
states
concerning
its
boundary
and
three
miles
being
its
--
the
maritime
belt,
that
is,
the
boundary
of
the
united
states.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
the
language
of
the
act
gives
them
the
right
according
to
their
boundary
at
the
time
they
entered.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
would
be
--
whatever
the
united
states
had
at
that
time,
they
couldn't
extend
beyond
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
now,
that
is
the
statement
that
this
--
this
act
shall
not
prejudice
whatever
that
situation
is.
but
the
grant
is
dependent
upon
the
description
of
the
boundaries
and
the
fact
that
is
dependent
upon
what
their
boundary
was
at
the
time
they
entered
the
union.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
so
that,
the
grant,
in
view
of
the
decision
of
the
court
that
all
of
the
submerged
lands
belong
to
the
united
states,
the
state
could
only
have
whatever
the
congress
saw
fit
to
give.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right,
because
this
court
held
that
they
never
had
in
the
tidelands
cases.
and
then,
you
have
to
look
to
the
act
to
see
what
the
congress
gave
--
was
willing
to
give
to
them
and
the
terms
upon
which
it
gave
it.
and
it
provided
that
they
should
get
what
was
within
their
historical
boundaries
at
the
time
they
entered
the
union
or
as
approved
by
congress
on
or
prior
to
may
22nd,
1953.
now,
there's
no
issue
between
us
that
congress
ever
proved
any
such
boundary
of
three
leagues
by
its
acts.
so,
it's
only
a
question
of
what
they
had
at
the
time
they
entered
the
union,
and
it's
the
position
of
the
united
states
that
they
could
not
have
anything
beyond
what
the
united
states
have.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that
their
position
is
that
the
three
miles
did
not
control
in
the
gulf
but
it's
based
upon
treaties
and
communications
which
this
court
takes
judicial
notice
of.
and
--
the
government's
position
is,
it
could
be
only
construed
one
way
which
is
the
way
that
the
political
branches
the
government
have
said,
“this
was
three
miles
for
this
country
since
1793
and
still
is
today
and
nobody,
as
a
matter
of
law,
can
dispute
it
even
though
louisiana
doesn't
concede
it
upon
the
act.”
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
official
correspondents
that
you
take
judicial
notice
of.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
don't
think
so.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
think
that
you
would
be
bound
by
what
the
government
says
because,
otherwise,
this
court
would
try
to
say
the
united
states
boundary
is
three
leagues
in
the
gulf
per
se.
and
where
the
political
branches,
the
state
department,
the
president
are
busy
before
the
international
law
committee
of
the
united
nations
within
a
very
recent
time
saying,
“the
united
states'
position
since
1793
has
been
that
the
boundary
of
the
united
states
is
only
three
miles
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
from
the
coast.”
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
true.
in
--
there's
a
case,
the
nelson
case,
an
early
case
in
regard
to
the
boundary
of
the
state
of
louisiana
in
which
that
very
question
came
out
--
came
before
this
court.
and
the
court
examined
the
question
about
whether
the
boundary
was
at
the
perdido
river
or
at
the
iberville
river.
and
it
was
contented
by
both
france
and
spain
that
the
boundary
was
different.
then,
the
united
states
government
claimed
and
this
court
said
that
even
though
it
would
arrive
at
a
different
conclusion,
it
was
bound
by
the
position
taken
by
the
political
branches
in
regard
to
what
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
those
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
need
not
view
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
you
need
not.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
is
what
i
was
trying
to
answer.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
did
you
understand?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
that's
controlling
in
regard
to
the
entire
matter,
but
we
have
developed
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
the
boundary
of
the
united
states.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
we
have
elaborated
to
try
to
satisfy
the
court
that
that
is
supported
by
the
history
of
this
country
since
1793
in
positions
taken
by
one
who
get
--
government
after
another
throughout
the
entire
history
of
the
country.
and
that's
recited
also
by
secretary
dulles'
letter
on
page
176.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
in
regard
to
the
historic
boundary
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
of
the
united
states,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
on
176,
secretary
dulles
recites
the
testimony
--
the
fact
that
the
department
of
state
testified
concerning
the
position
of
the
united
states,
traditionally
supported
the
three-mile
limit.
that
is
a
breadth
of
territorial
waters
to
three
nautical
miles
measured
from
low
water
mark
on
the
shore.
and
then,
he
proceeds
to
refer
to
the
action
back
in
1793
under
secretary
of
state,
jefferson,
and
delineates
the
position
taken
there
and
also
that
we
protested
against
the
claims
of
spain
concerning
a
six-mile
boundary
for
the
island
of
cuba
and
insisted
that
it
was
three
miles.
and
then,
he
goes
on,
on
page
179,
saying,
“the
position
of
the
united
states
on
the
three
--
three-mile
limit
has
remained
unchanged
to
this
day
and
at
no
time
has
this
government
followed
a
different
policy
regarding
the
extent
of
its
territorial
waters
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
freedom
of
the
seas
continues
to
be
essential
to
the
national
interest
of
the
united
states,
particularly,
in
the
mattes
of
commerce,
fishing,
and
defense.
free
sea
lanes
and
air
officer
over
the
seas
are
essential
to
the
maintenance
of
the
preeminence
of
the
united
states
in
commercial
shipping
and
air
transport.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
now
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
--
it
depends
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
depends
upon
whether
the
court
will
also
take
the
further
step
with
me
that
the
boundary
of
the
united
states
can
only
be
determined
by
the
united
states.
and
that
no
state
of
the
union
can
determine
the
boundary
of
the
united
states.
if
you
would
take
that
step
with
me
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
if
you
take
that
step
and
then
the
further
step
that
no
state
could
possibly
have
a
boundary
that
extended
beyond
the
boundary
of
the
united
states
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
that
is
the
contention
the
united
states
makes.
we
don't
cite
in
any
case
for
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
we
think
it's
inherent
that
no
state
of
the
union
can
have
any
territory
that
extends
beyond
that
of
the
united
states
whenever
it
is
part
of
the
union.
it
can
have
less
and
this
court
recognized
the
state
could
extend
for
a
lesser
distance
than
the
united
states
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
in
u.s.against
california.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
agree
that
that's
entirely
--
that's
a
different
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
suggest
that
congress
could
have
said
that,
regardless
of
whatever
the
united
states
has
done
in
the
past
about
three
miles,
any
state
or
the
states
in
the
gulf
may
have
an
area
out
to
three
leagues,
but
they
didn't
say
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
congress,
i
don't
think,
could
say
the
united
states
had
a
maritime
boundary.
the
boundary
of
the
united
states,
at
the
time
1812,
when
louisiana
entered
the
union,
was
more
than
three
miles
because
nobody
could
determine
or
could
so
state
and
make
it
a
fact
when
the
position
of
the
government
was,
at
that
time,
by
the
people
who
had
the
power
to
make
that
position,
that
it
was
only
three
miles.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
difference
in
the
question
is
that
congress
did
not
see
fit
to
make
the
grant
on
that
kind
of
a
basis.
now,
if
it
had
--
if
it
said
the
boundary,
based
upon
whatever
the
historic
records
might
show
that
louisiana
can
produce
prior
to
the
time
it
entered
the
union
and
we
granted
that,
that
would
be
something
else.
but
they
--
they
were
very
careful
not
to
make
that
because
they
were
not
willing
to
pass
upon
this
claim
or
to
give
them
any
three
leagues.
the
presumption
was
that
they
were
only
entitled
to
three
miles
and
everybody
was
given
that.
and
they
tried
to
make
it
very
clear
that
if
they
had,
it
could
show
that
their
boundary,
even
though
that
was
--
they'd
already
had
the
evidence
it
couldn't
be
beyond
that,
was
three
leagues,
they
would
get
it
and
not
otherwise.
and
the
state
boundary
was
the
test
that
they
made,
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct.
they
--
they
wanted
to
leave
that
question
not
decided
by
the
congress
and
open
to
the
courts,
as
the
managers
of
the
bill
said.
and
the
--
the
only
thing
that
they
did
make
very
clear
in
order
to,
and
i
think
it
would've
been
impossible
from
the
legislative
history
to
get
the
agreement
that
they
did
on
the
legislation
without
it,
was
that
they
were
not
granting
anything
that
would
extend
to
recognition
of
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
you
can
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
you
can
find
some
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
language
that
would
indicate
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
didn't
find
any
language
that
would
indicate
anything
in
regard
to
that,
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
there
is
nothing
of
that
kind.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
i
think
it
does.
it's
a
question
of
whether
the
government
is
right
in
its
contention
that,
the
boundary
at
the
time
it
entered
the
union,
the
language
is
clear
that
that's
what
it
says
is
controlling.
and
whether
or
not
any
state
could
have
a
boundary
beyond
three
miles
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
united
states,
by
all
of
the
positions
of
the
political
branches
which
are
binding
upon
this
court,
according
to
our
contention,
was
that
it
couldn't
be
beyond
three
miles
for
the
united
states
and
the
state
couldn't
be
beyond
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
on
the
part
that
this
action
might
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
“if
any
it
had”
is
the
effort
by
the
congress
not
to
affect
or
prejudice
in
any
way
by
the
legislation
and
not
to
say
they
did.
they
are
very
careful
to
not
say
that
they
did
have
any
rights
or
any
basis
for
such
claim.
and
it
was
frankly
stated
that
it
would
be
up
to
courts
to
determine.
louisiana
also
contends
that
its
boundary
extends
out,
and
we've
furnished
some
small
maps,
i'm
sorry
about
the
size
of
them
because
they're
hard
to
read,
the
various
leagues
of
the
various
places,
but
the
mine
shown
in
pink
along
the
border
of
louisiana
is
the
government's
contention
as
to
whether
the
three-mile
line
was
granted.
that's
from
a
to
a.
line
from
b,
shown
in
the
darker
color.
from
c
to
c
is
the
additional
area
making
three
leagues.
assuming
the
baseline
to
be
where
the
government
contends.
louisiana
claims
that
the
baseline
should
be
taken
from
the
coast
guard
line
which
is
the
line
from
a
to
d
and
over
here
is
the
dotted
line,
and
then,
the
three
leagues
would
be
out
from
e
--
from
e
to
c.
now
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
dotted
line.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
and
it's
the
position
of
the
government
at
this
time
that
the
court
does
not
need
to
decide
that
question
at
--
at
this
time.
there
are
--
we
concede
that
there
are
many
questions
in
regard
to
facts
concerning
the
line
--
the
baseline
and
the
sinuosities
of
the
coast
and
where
the
various
points
would
be,
how
they
would
be
measured,
the
rules
that
would
be
applied.
and
the
court
followed
a
similar
plan
in
regard
to
the
case
of
u.s.against
california
where
they
decided
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
state
or
the
united
states
was
entitled
to
the
submerged
area
and
then
reserve
the
question
of
where
the
coastline
was
to
be
handled
by
a
special
master
and
his
examination
of
the
facts
and
details.
and
the
government
is
now
asking
that
the
court
pass
only
upon
the
question
of
whether
it's
three
miles
or
three
leagues,
and
agrees
that
louisiana
is
entitled
to
have
evidence
and
probably,
a
special
master
to
develop
a
question
of,
assuming
it's
three
miles,
where
shall
it
be
measured
from
and
where
is
the
proper
coastline.
but
we
do
want
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
coast
guard
line,
the
dotted
line,
has
no
real
relation
to
the
--
what
is
a
proper
measure
of
the
coastline
under
all
of
the
legal
holdings.
the
line
was
prepared
by
the
commandant
of
the
coast
guard
and
it
was
not
made
with
reference
to
what
the
coastline
should
be
or
boundary
of
any
state
should
be,
but
was
made
with
regard
to
navigation
and
navigational
aids.
and
it
runs
along
from
the
point
a
to
d,
along
the
islands
here,
and
then
you'll
notice
it
departs
at
some
points
in
as
much
as
10
nautical
miles
away
and
then
on,
one-and-a
half
to
six
at
other
points,
and
it
doesn't
purport
to
touch
any
land
for
practically
the
entire
distance
from
about
60
miles
over
here
on
the
east
side
of
the
coast
at
all.
so
that,
if
the
court,
in
examining
this
question
that
we're
asking
the
court
to
pass
on
at
this
time,
would
determine
whether
or
not
the
measure
of
the
maritime
belt
is
three
miles
or
three
leagues,
and
would
also
decide
whether
or
not
the
coast
guard
was
a
proper
baseline
of
which
to
try
to
measure
the
coast,
it
would
be
of
great
help
in
--
in
passing
onto
the
detailed
question
of
the
measurement
of
the
coast,
which
we
assume
would
be
done
by
direction
of
the
court
before
a
special
master
in
an
action
similar
to
what
was
taken
in
the
case
of
u.s.against
california.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
have
one
line
but
they
went
27
miles.
that's
clear
down
g
to
g.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
then
the
e
to
ec
is
the
three
leagues
based
upon
the
coastline
as
the
--
at
the
coast
guard
line
as
the
base
line
under
their
act
33.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
it
was
suggested
that
it
would
help
everybody
in
the
exploitation
of
this
area
if
congress
would
draw
the
line
in
detail
on
all
the
coasts.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
was
done
in
california
and
the
master
did
examine
the
questions
there
and
brought
in
a
report
to
this
court.
now,
the
court
hasn't
acted
on
it
and
with
--
the
government
hasn't
asked
the
court
to
act
on
it
yet.
but
it's
--
it's
not
an
impossible
proceeding.
we
tried
to
anticipate
it
and
then
avoid
it
by
suggesting
the
action
of
the
congress,
and
the
reaction
of
congress
was
it
would
be
impossible
for
them
to
agree.
and
i
think
further,
though,
in
complete
frankness,
there
was
a
--
they
didn't
want
to
resolve
the
question
about
the
three
leagues
or
the
three
miles,
too,
and
they
said
during
the
debates
that
that
would
be
a
question
the
courts
would
have
to
determine
about
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
not
except
to
make
it
clear
that
they
were
not
passing
on
this
question
of
three
miles
and
three
leagues.
that
--
i
think
that's
clear.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
--
i'd
have
to
refresh
my
memory
about
whether
it
was
detailed
proof
or
exact
language
on
that.
but
it
was
clear
that
they
did
not
want
to
prejudice
whatever
action
would
be
brought
by
the
states
in
regard
to
three
leagues.
they
didn't
want
to
approve
the
three
leagues
or
take
any
action
that
would
indicate
any
approval
of
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
my
recollection.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
must
correct
my
prior
answer.
the
section
3
is
the
grant
part
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
and
2
defines
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct,
although
section
4,
in
the
first
part,
does
authorize
every
state
to
come
out
to
three
miles.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
so,
if
they
hadn't
already
gotten
out
three
miles,
they
have
a
right
to.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
that's
an
approval
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
that
congress
talked
about.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
yes,
except
it's
the
united
states
position
that
they
couldn't
have
any
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
because
this
court
has
already
adjudicated
it
and
therefore,
you
go
back
to
the
decisions
of
the
court,
find
that
its
res
judicata.
it
isn't
just
stare
decisis.
it's
an
adjudication
between
these
parties
about
this
very
question,
that
they
had
no
rights
whatsoever
from
the
low
water
line
out
into
the
submerged
lands
area.
the
only
place
they
could
possibly
get,
from
the
date
of
that
decision
on,
would
be
this
act.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
except
that
it
seems
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
act
is
clear
that
the
act
gave
them
whatever
their
boundary
was
when
they
entered
the
union
or
as
approved
on
or
prior
to
may
22nd,
1953.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
provided
by
its
constitution
or
laws,
it
doesn't
say
that
their
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
doesn't
say
if
there
are
history
or
anything
like
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
it
says
nothing
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
because
the
effect
of
their
entering
the
union
and
the
benefits
they
got
from
that
also
had
the
effect
of
giving
them
the
boundary
of
the
united
states.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
act
said
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
where
we
get
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
we
think
that
the
act
is
explicit
about
the
grant
and
that
that
the
granting
part
in
light
of
the
history
of
trying
to
not
pass
this
question,
one
way
or
the
other,
to
prove
the
three
--
three-league
boundary
is
explicitly
in
making
the
terms
of
the
grant
the
moment
they
entered
the
union
or
if
there
could
be
found
any
language
where
congress,
prior
to
the
date
of
the
act,
had
approved
--
expressly
approved,
and
there
is
no
such
contention
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
but
it
was
the
history
of
these
acts
that
or
the
tidelands
litigation
that
the
states
and
the
united
states
were
contending
that
certain
acts
had
certain
effect.
and
it
was
continued
to
be
contended
in
the
connection
with
this
legislation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
these
various
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
think
that
it
could
because
these
states
were
still
contending
that
these
various
claims
that
they
had
had
some
legal
validity
regardless
of
the
decision
of
this
court
and
--
and
the
decisions
of
this
court.
and
that
was
an
issue
that
the
congress
didn't
see
fit
to
try
to
determine
as
to
whether
or
not
these
various
contentions
as
to
the
three
leagues,
historic
events
that
were
contended
for,
had
any
effect.
but
this
court
would
be,
it
seems
to
us,
bound
by
the
action
of
the
political
branches
in
that
regard
and
even
though
the
states
would
not
recognize
it
--
not
be
willing
to
recognize
it,
would
have
to
conclude
that
those
were
the
determining
factors
in
this
entire
matter.
and
so,
congress
did
not
try
to
resolve
that
question
and
left
into
the
courts.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
if
the
--
you
would
hold
that
there
were
three
leagues,
then
you
would
--
we
would
still
have
the
problem
of
where
they
would
--
the
measurement
would
be
made.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
if
this
court
would
hold
that
congress
intended
to
grant
three
leagues,
then
that
would
be
binding
upon
the
parties
and
the
measurement
would
still
have
to
be
made
as
to
whether
--
where
it
would
be
from
and
the
fact
that
it
does
not
extend
out
to
27
miles
as
claimed
by
louisiana.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that's
what
the
united
states
claims.
and
we
say
that
this
court
has
no
power
to
determine
that
the
boundary
of
the
united
states
is
three
leagues
when
the
political
branches
say
its
three
miles.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
except
that
you
were
bound
by
the
language
they
used
which
says
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
which
uses
state
boundaries.
now,
if
they
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
was
suggested
to
them
that
this
legislation
might
be
drafted
so
it
provided
for
exploration
of
these
minerals
and
other
subsurface
rights,
and
that
was
rejected.
now,
if
they
had
done
that
and
not
connected
it
up
with
state
boundaries
at
all,
there
certainly
would
be
no
problem
that
we
have
here
today
because
they
wouldn't
be
limited
by
the
state
boundaries
or
the
federal
boundary
limiting
the
state
boundary.
and
they
could
have
exploration
wherever
they
wanted.
but
for
this
court
to
say
that
the
state
boundary
of
the
state
of
louisiana
is
three
leagues
when
the
executive
department
is
saying,
in
all
of
its
dealings
with
other
nations
in
the
world,
that
its
three
miles.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
but
with
all
due
respect
to
this
court,
i
don't
believe
this
court
can
say
that
any
state
of
the
union
can
extend
beyond
the
boundaries
of
the
united
states.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
a
problem.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
the
scariotis
case,
i
think.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
think
that
that
we're
entitled
to
judgment
for
the
limited
position
that
we're
asking
at
this
time
in
the
court,
and
were
entitled
to
accounting
under
the
prior
decree
of
the
court
for
all
of
the
income
obtained
from
the
area
beyond
the
three
miles.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
--
the
rest
of
my
time
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
i'll
try
to
do
that.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
sorry,
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
may
it
please
the
court.
if
you
will
bear
with
me
just
a
moment,
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
the
act
and
clarify
what
appears
to
me
to
be
a
slight
misunderstanding
as
to
its
terms.
on
page
165
of
the
government's
brief,
section
2
subparagraph
(b)
of
2,
the
definition
of
the
term
"boundaries"
and,
there,
you
will
see
the
language
used
as
they
existed
with
regard
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
at
the
time
such
state
became
a
member
of
the
union,
or
as
heretofore
approved
by
the
congress,
or
as
extended
or
confirmed
pursuant
to
section
4
hereof
but,
in
no
event,
shall
the
term
“boundaries,”
and
so
forth.
so
that,
the
extended
or
confirmed
is
the
part
that
refers
to
section
4.
then,
if
you
refer
to
section
3
subparagraph
(a),
you
will
see
there
is
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
the
lands,
where
it's
to
be
in
the
public
interest
to
make
the
declaration,
is
within
the
boundaries
of
the
respective
states.
and
then,
in
subparagraph
(b)(1),
the
united
states
hereby
releases,
relinquishes,
and
so
forth.
and
then,
reading
down
to
the
fourth
line,
all
said
lands,
improvements,
and
natural
resources
taking
the
train
back
through
those
sections.
it's
the
lands,
as
i've
referred
to,
within
the
boundaries
of
the
respective
states
in
section
3
that
are
relinquished
in
(b)(1)
where
the
grant
is.
and,
the
boundary
definition
is
back
in
(b)
of
(2).
now,
if
you
turnover
to
section
4,
you
will
see
that
the
language
“any
state
admitted
subsequent
to
the
formation
of
the
union,
which
has
not
already
done
so,
may
extend
its
seaward
boundaries,”
to
what?
“to
a
line
three
geographical
miles
distance
from
its
coastline.
any
claim
heretofore
or
hereafter
asserted,
either
by
constitutional
provision,
statute,
or
otherwise,
indicating
the
intent
of
a
state
so
to
extend
its
boundaries
is
hereby
approved
and
confirmed
as
to
three
miles,”
not
three
leagues,
“without
prejudice
to
its
claim,
if
any
it
has,
that
its
boundaries
extend
beyond
that
line.”
it
isn't
empowered
by
those
means
to
get
out
to
three
leagues.
it's
empowered
to
get
to
three
miles
but,
without
prejudice,
to
whatever
rights
it
has,
in
any
other
way
to
beyond
that
point.
and
then,
nothing
in
this
is
--
this
section
is
to
be
construed
as
affecting
those
rights
to
three
leagues,
and
so
forth.
so,
what
the
congress
was
trying
to
do
was
say,
“this
situation,
as
far
as
there
are
legal
rights
to
a
three-league
boundary,
is
the
same
as
though
this
act
had
never
been
passed,
insofar
as
to
whether
they
had
such
a
boundary
or
didn't
have
such
a
boundary.”
now,
the
grant
is
something
different.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
they
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
excuse
me.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
gives
it
this
meaning,
that
there
were
powerful
forces
contending
in
the
congress
for
different
view
points.
and,
one
of
the
contentions
was
that
congress
should
not
foreclose
the
claim
to
three
leagues.
another
was
that
they
should
put
a
blessing
on
it
and
approve
it.
and
another
was
that
they
shouldn't
get
it
in
any
event,
that
all
states
should
be
limited
to
three
miles.
now,
congress
selected
the
one
where
they
said,
“we
won't
put
any
blessing
on
it.
if
you
can
prove
it,
in
spite
of
the
fact
of
the
position
of
the
united
states
and
all,
that's
up
to
you
to
go
to
court
and
do
it.”
that's
--
that's
what
we
feel
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there
wasn't
any
promise
in
it.
they
only
gave
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
they
were
allowed
to
prove
that,
at
the
time
they
entered
their
union,
they
--
the
state
boundary
extended
to
three
leagues,
if
they
could
prove
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
what
you've
just
said
is
correct,
but
everybody
didn't
agree
to
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
if
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
only
if
this
court
is
not
going
to
be
bound
by
its
decisions
recognizing
the
decision
as
to
the
boundary
of
the
united
states
by
the
political
branch
of
the
government.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
agree
to
that
because
it
is
also
a
political
branch
of
the
government
that
has
the
power
to
say
that,
despite
everything
that's
done
in
the
executive
branch,
and
there
is
a
refinement
of
limitations
there
as
to
whether
they're
acting
within
their
area
as
distinguished
with
the
executive's
area,
but
assuming
that
we
don't
have
that
problem,
that
they've
also
have
the
power
to
declare
the
boundary
of
the
united
states,
and
can
do
it.
now,
i
say,
with
due
respect
to
this
court,
that
those
two
branches
have
the
power
to
say
that
in
regard
to
the
boundary
of
the
united
states
in
their
proper
areas
of
action,
and
this
court
will
take
that
action
to
say
no
state
in
the
union
can
extend
beyond
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
don't
think
that
interpretation
is
proper
and
i
think,
upon
studying
the
brief,
you
will
find
that
it's
not.
but,
i
think
if
the
congress
had
said
that
the
--
the
boundary
of
the
united
states
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
is
hereby
extended
three
leagues,
instead
of
three
miles,
then
you
would
have
the
problem
that
you
are
describing.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
agree
with
that
and
the
reason
for
it
was
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
you
should
find
why
they
did
it.
and,
the
reason
they
did
it
was
not
to,
at
that
point,
chop
them
off
by
the
congressional
action
and
decide
right
then,
as
they
apparently
did
with
all
the
rest
of
the
country
that
three
miles
is
the
limit.
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
because
of
the
other
language
they
used
about
what
was
the
measure
of
how
the
--
the
rights
they
would
get,
which
was
their
state
boundary
at
the
time
they
entered
the
union.
now,
here,
we
have,
in
addition
to
all
of
that,
we
have
a
territory
of
louisiana.
we
don't
have,
like
with
texas,
an
independent
nation
or
republic.
so
that,
whatever
property
they
had
prior
to
that
time
was
the
property
of
the
united
states.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
when
we
got
the
purchase,
then
it
was
described
by
running
along
the
gulf,
together
with
the
islands
within
three
leagues.
now,
we
have
--
in
several
cases,
the
united
states
has
--
states
has
a
treaty
with
britain
about
the
eastern
coast
running
from
the
bay
of
fundy
down
to
the
river
between
georgia
and
florida,
giving
the
united
states
all
of
the
islands
within
20
leagues.
and,
it's
always
been
our
policy
that
we
only
claim
three
miles
plus
the
islands.
the
same
is
true
over
in
the
bering
sea
with
the
treaty
with
russia.
we've
taken
that
position
for
--
since
1860
or
1870.
i
guess
it
was
1870-something
in
regard
to
russia.
so
that,
the
position
of
the
united
states
is
that
such
language
gives
you
the
islands
and
what
--
the
coast,
but
not
the
intervening
land.
and
then,
you
look
to
see
whether,
under
proper
laws,
the
inland
waters
are
defined
to
be
according
to
bays
and
other
things
that
we
think
should
be
a
subsequent
part
of
this
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
you
always
have
to
read
where
you're
going
to
draw
the
line,
which
is
from
the
coastline
or
the
high
water
mark,
in
order
to
get
the
measurement
of
the
two
sides.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
way
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
i
read
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
mr.
justice,
is
that
all
lands
permanently
or
periodically
covered
by
tidal
waters
up
to,
but
not
above,
the
line
of
mean
high
tide,
and
i
interpolated,
then
seaward
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
to
a
line
three
geographical
miles
distance
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
in
the
coast.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
true.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
but
you
have
to
take
the
term
"boundaries"
when
you
--
when
it's
used
here
to
find
out
how
it's
defined
and
in
this
same,
too,
it
says
“when
it
became
a
member
of
the
union.”
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
only
--
i
would
like
to
just
say
one
thing
about
the
depositions,
if
i
may,
mr.
justice.
we
suggest
that
if
the
court
feels
that
the
united
states'
position
is
justified
and
that
if
you
can,
at
this
time,
determine
the
question
between
three
miles
and
three
leagues,
that
the
question
of
depositions
should
at
least
be
reserved
until
we
know
the
extent
of
the
line,
whether
it's
three
miles
or
three
leagues.
the
motion,
as
you
recall,
is
to
take
depositions,
and
that
is
all
that
the
motion
involves
as
far
as
louisiana's
concerned
at
this
point,
as
we
understand
it.
and,
we
think
that
it
would
be
much
more
serviceable
to
all
of
the
parties
if
that
question
is
reserved
until
we
know
whether
it's
three
leagues
or
three
miles
that's
involved.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
think
that's
involved
in
their
defense
to
our
motion,
in
that,
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
there
are
any
issues
of
fact,
at
this
point,
that
the
court
does
not
take
judicial
notice
of.
if
the
court
would
conclude
that
there
are
none,
then
their
question
of
deposition
would
bear
on
this
baseline
and
the
problem
before
you
do
the
measuring.
if
the
court
would
conclude,
from
the
briefs
and
material
that's
presented
to
the
court,
that
there
are
questions
that
would
bear
upon
the
facts
that
would
have
any
materiality,
then
the
depositions,
i
assume,
would
--
would
bear
on
that,
too.
but,
if
you
conclude
that
the
facts
are
such,
that
there
is
no
issue
that's
material
in
regard
to
all
of
these
other
things
that
would
attack
the
old
decisions
and
so
forth,
then,
it
seems
to
me,
you
get
down
to
the
question
of
baseline
and
the
deposition
for
that
purpose.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
can
express
myself
now
in
behalf
of
the
government
that
the
united
states
would
much
prefer
doing
it
to
a
special
master.
we
would
prefer
not
to
have
the
duplication
that's
involved
in
taking
the
depositions
and
then
appearing
before
a
master,
too.
and,
we
do
not
think
that
the
cases
preclude
the
court,
assuming
that
you
follow
the
civil
rules,
from
doing
it
otherwise.
we
think
it
would
save
everybody's
time.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
