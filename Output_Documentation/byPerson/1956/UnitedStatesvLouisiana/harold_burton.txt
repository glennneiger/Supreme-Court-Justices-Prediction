justice
harold
burton
mr.
solicitor
general,
did
i
understand
you
to
a
sharp
distinction
between
at
the
time
such
state
became
a
member
of
the
union
and
the
situation
before
it
became
a
member
of
the
union?
justice
harold
burton
so,
even
though
they
proved
that
they
had,
before
they
entered,
the
longer
three-league
limit,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
because,
at
the
time
that
they
entered,
they
lost
it.
justice
harold
burton
well,
what
do
you
do
with
--
with
the
phrase
that
if
it
is
so
provided
by
the
constitutional
laws,
“prior
to”
or
“at
the
time”?
if
the
law
is
“prior
to”
in
section
4
or,
in
any
manner,
fencing
the
distance
of
any
state
seaward
boundary
provided
beyond
three
geographical
miles,
if
it
is
so
provide
by
its
constitution
or
laws
prior
to
or
at
the
time
such
state
became
a
member.
justice
harold
burton
that's
the
granting
clause
rather
than
--
justice
harold
burton
--
probably
this
section
called.
justice
harold
burton
thank
you.
justice
harold
burton
need
not.
justice
harold
burton
now,
for
the
factor,
if
any
they
have?
justice
harold
burton
and
it
says
without
prejudice
to
--
to
any
claim
that
they
may
have
but
it
doesn't
permit
itself
for
there
being
any
at
all.
