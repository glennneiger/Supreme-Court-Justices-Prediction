justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
does
that
mean,
mr.
solicitor
that,
under
the
statute,
all
that
congress
contemplated
that
the
states
would
have
an
opportunity
to
do,
from
the
government's
point
of
view,
was
that
the
state
could
establish
that,
in
fact,
the
national
boundary
was
not
three
miles
at
the
time
the
state
entered
the
union.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
if,
as
i
gather
you're
suggesting
to
us,
it
can
be
established
from
judicial
notice
of
something
that,
in
fact,
the
national
boundary
at
the
time
the
state
entered
the
union
was
three
miles,
then,
necessarily,
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
statute
is
satisfied
and
the
state
must
lose.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor,
i
think
you
said
earlier
that
it
would
not
be
fair
to
say
that
louisiana
agreed
that
there
was
a
national
maritime
three-mile
line.
would
it
be
fair
to
say
that
louisiana
disagrees
that
there
was,
at
the
time
of
its
entry,
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
a
national
three-mile
line?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
if
that's
based
upon
treaties
and
i
take
it,
other
documents,
as
well
as
treaties?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
would
there
be
fact
questions
underlying
the
interpretation
of
those
treaties
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
correspondents?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
that
to
say,
then,
that
there
would
be
--
there
need
not
even
authority
in
this
court
to
examine
the
underlying
treaties
and
documents.
if
those
have
been
interpreted,
as
you
have
stated
to
us,
they
have
been
interpreted
by
department
of
state
and
the
president
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
but
that
we
would
have
to
accept
those
as
the
interpretations
even
though,
examining
them
ourselves,
we,
perhaps,
might
reach
a
different
--
find
a
different
meaning
in
the
previous
concern.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
isn't
that
saying
that
to
resolve
the
issue,
at
least
in
the
frame
of
reference
that
the
government
presents
it,
we
need
to
examine
nothing
except
those
political
--
those
determinations
by
the
political
branches
of
the
government?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
form
do
those
determinations
take?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
what's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
how
i
understood
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
as
i
understood
you
to
answer
to
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
then,
perhaps
you've
already
answered.
is
secretary
dulles'
letter
the
only
thing
we
need
to
look
at?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
anything
else
claimed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
it
was
cited
also
and
that's
comprehensive
of
everything
else
you're
urging
upon
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
solicitor,
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
can
you
find
anywhere,
either
in
the
statute
itself,
preferably
in
the
statute,
or
not
in
this
legislative
history,
any
recognition
by
the
congress
that
if
it
were
the
fact
that
the
there
was
a
national
three-mile
band
and
that's
all
at
the
time
of
entry,
that
congress
recognized
that,
then,
louisiana
could
have
no
claim
beyond
three
miles?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then,
was
it
--
well,
is
there
anything
to
indicate
that
congress
was
in
doubt
upon
that
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then,
that
does
get
us
back,
basically,
to
what
this
last
sentence
means,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
is
that
--
is
that
“couldn't
be
beyond
those
three
miles”
in
any
way
imported
in
its
claim,
if
any
it
has?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
section
4,
confirmed
without
prejudice
to
its
claim,
if
any
it
has,
that
its
boundaries
extended
beyond
that
line.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
even
if
only
the
three
miles
went
out
on
that
coast
guard
--
which
one
is
it?
the
coast
guard
line,
is
that
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
d-da?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
--
in
other
words,
is
there
a
contention
that
even
if
not
three
leagues,
at
least
three
miles
is
measured
from
that
line
rather
than
from
the
government's
baseline?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
solicitor,
what
about
this
other
line,
this
louisiana
act
33,
1954,
line
according
to
this
legend?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
one,
further
seaward.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
the
--
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
incidentally,
i
noticed
apparently,
that
that
line
seems
exactly
to
parallel
the
coast
guard
navigational
line.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
mr.
wilkinson,
i
had
the
impression
the
government's
argument
was
“so,
what?”
even
though
you
establish
it.
they'll
assume
it
and,
yet,
say
you
can't
go
beyond
three
miles
because
that
was
the
national
thing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
the
time
of
your
entry
and,
that
being
true,
it's
immaterial
that
you
establish
your
proposition,
you
know.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
assume
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
assume
his
position
conceding
to
you
that
you
may
be
able
to
establish
that
it
was
three
leagues.
what,
in
the
way
of
facts,
would
we
have
to
hear
to
decide
his
proposition
that,
in
any
event,
the
national
limit
was
three
miles?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather,
then,
that's
to
say
to
me
that
taking
the
government
on
its
own
terms.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
is
still
a
fact
question
which
you're
entitled
to
have
resolved
at
the
trial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
wilkinson,
can
you
enlighten
us
at
all
why
this
language
in
section
4
without
--
without
prejudice
to
its
claim
that
is
beyond
three
miles,
if
any
it
has?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they're
not
in
section
4?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
this
is
--
this
is
an
inaccurate
statement
at
page
167
of
the
government's
brief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
purports
to
give
us
the
verbatim
quotation
or
a
part
at
least
to
section
4.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
page
167
of
the
government's
brief.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
page
167.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
both
sections
3
and
4?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
the
actual
language
is
“without
prejudice
to
its
claim,
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
if
any
it
had.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
boundaries
extend
beyond
that
line.
what
puzzles
me
is,
why
that
form
of
words
and
whether
there's
any
enlightenment
upon
the
use
of
them
that
would
be
found
in
the
legislative
history.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
rankin,
before
you
sit
down,
just
one
last
question.
as
i
get
it
now,
what
you're,
in
effect,
telling
us
is
that
the
granting
clause
is
using
boundaries,
notwithstanding
this
reference
to
something
beyond
three
miles
and
four
in
section
4,
in
fact,
limits
boundaries
to
the
three-mile
--
to
the
three-mile
band.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
do
you
do
then
with
the
granting
clause
also
contains
language
of
ownership
of
the
lands
beneath
navigable
waters
within
the
boundaries,
and
you
get
back
now
to
2
(a)
or
a
(2),
rather.
and,
lands
within
the
united
states
are
defined
as
seaward
to
a
line,
three
miles
distance,
from
the
coastline
and
to
the
boundary
line
of
such
state
where,
in
any
case,
such
boundary,
as
it
existed
at
the
time
the
state
became
a
member
of
the
union,
extends
seaward
beyond
three
geographical
miles.
don't
you
have
to
read
both
definitions
into
the
granting
clause?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
this
says
that
lands
means
everything
seaward
to
three
miles
distance
or
where
it
was
so
at
the
time
the
state
came
into
the
union
to
that
point
beyond
three
geographical
miles,
wherever
it
may
be.
that's
what
a
(2),
at
least
the
excerpt,
i
find
at
164
of
your
brief,
at
the
bottom.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
then,
go
on.
and,
to
the
boundary
line
of
each
state
where,
in
any
case,
such
boundary
as
existed
when
the
state
became
a
member
of
the
union
extended
seaward
beyond
three
geographical
miles.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
extended
seaward
or
into
the
gulf
of
mexico,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
don't
you
have
to
take
that
definition
and
read
it
into
the
use
of
the
words
“lands
beneath
navigable
waters”
in
the
granting
clause?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
then
--
then
this
broader
definition
is
limited
by
the
word
“boundaries”
which
is
defined
to
be
within
three
miles.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
certainly
did
a
fine
job
of
confusing
it,
didn't
they?
