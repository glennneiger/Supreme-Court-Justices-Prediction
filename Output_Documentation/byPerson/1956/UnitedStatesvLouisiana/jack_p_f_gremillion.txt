mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
mr.
justice
black
and
your
honors,
i
should
like
to
start
very
briefly
with
the
submerged
lands
act.
but,
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
the
same
session
of
congress
also
passed
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act.
i
should
like
to
point
out
that,
in
the
submerged
lands
act,
the
congress
gave
definitions,
the
congress
gave
a
relinquishment
or
a
quick
claim
or
a
conveyance
of
lands
within
--
submerged
lands
within
three
miles
to
all
of
the
states,
and
the
congress
gave
to
each
of
the
states
in
the
--
their
border
on
the
gulf
of
mexico
the
right
to
prove
that
their
boundaries
went
further,
if
they
could
do
so.
and,
that
would
be
a
very
poor
concession
to
have
made
to
the
states
who
were
arguing
for
that
right
if
the
congress
had
meant
“but
when
you
get
to
court,
you
will
find
that
the
right
is
empty
because
you,
if
you
prove
it,
can
get
nothing
from
it.”
now,
the
same
congress
passed
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
and,
when
it
did
so,
it
did
not
say
that
our
outer
continental
shelf
begins
three
miles
from
the
coast
or
even
three
miles
from
the
shore.
it
said
it
begins
from
where
the
submerged
lands,
the
boundaries
established
under
the
submerged
lands
act,
leave
off.
to
turn
to
the
act
--
the
language
of
congress,
the
term
“outer
continental
shelf,”
and
that's
on
page
6
of
our
brief,
means
all
submerged
lands
lying
seaward
and
outside
of
the
area
of
lands
beneath
navigable
waters
as
defined
in
section
1301
of
this
title
and,
of
which,
the
subsoil
and
seabed
appertain
to
the
united
states
and
are
subject
to
jurisdiction
and
control.
and
so,
the
same
congress
made
a
distinction
between
the
lands
it
was
dealing
with
for
the
states
and
the
lands
it
was
dealing
with
in
connection
with
the
outer
continental
shelf.
and
may
i
say
here
that
it
was
not
only
the
congress,
but
the
president
also,
for
the
president
signed
these
acts
and
both
political
branches
of
the
government,
the
executive
as
well
as
the
legislative,
said
that
the
gulf
states
would
be
permitted
to
prove
that
they
had
three
leagues
when
they
came
into
the
union
or
that
three
leagues
had
been
approved
thereafter
if
they
could,
and
it
is
--
it
is
unthinkable
to
me
that
the
president
and
the
congress
would
say
that
we
would
have
the
right
to
do
it,
but
that
a
cabinet
officer
of
the
same
president
would
say
“but
we
can't
have
the
right
to
do
it
because
the
national
boundaries
never
went
so
far.”
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
dulles
does
not
say
that.
and,
if
you
will
refer
to
his
letter,
which
appears
in
the
government's
brief,
he
took
care
really
not
to
say
that.
on
page
178
of
the
brief,
after
talking
about
mr.
jefferson's
care
in
this
matter,
and
you
will
remember
that
mr.
jefferson
said
the
least
we
have
is
three-miles
but
he
didn't
say
we
don't
have
more,
and
mr.
dulles
in
his
letter
to
mr.
brownell
says
that
the
caution
which
led
jefferson
to
reserve
for
further
consideration
the
claims
of
the
united
states
in
this
matter
continued
to
mark
the
position
of
this
government
for
a
few
years
after
the
turn
of
the
century.
that's
in
the
middle
of
page
178.
now,
how
many
years
after
the
turn
of
the
century?
louisiana
came
into
the
union
in
1812.
louisiana
had
its
enabling
act
in
1811.
the
louisiana
purchase
or
session
was
in
1803.
all
of
these
were
a
few
years
after
the
turn
of
the
century.
in
1811,
we
were
to
have,
and
in
1812,
all
islands
within
three
leagues
of
the
coast.
in
1817,
mississippi
was
to
have
all
islands
within
six
leagues
of
the
shore.
in
1819,
alabama
was
to
have
all
islands
within
six
leagues
of
the
shore.
in
1819,
we
make
a
treaty
with
mexico
discussing
three
leagues,
and
so
on
and
on
and
on,
and
no
date
does
mr.
dulles
suggest
prior
to
1862
when
he
says
“the
policy
of
the
united
states
as
to
three
miles
became
firm
and
it
was
not
applied
to
the
gulf
of
mexico.”
and,
there
is
nothing
whatever
to
limit
the
territory
of
the
united
states
two-three
miles
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
and,
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
by
the
submerged
lands
acts
and
by
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act,
show
as
positively
as
people
can
that
they
think
the
boundary
of
the
united
states
extends
at
least
three
leagues.
now,
there
is
a
difference
on
the
atlantic
coast,
on
the
pacific
coast
where
the
continental
shelf
dropped
sharply,
and
from
our
coast
where
it
tapers
off
gradually.
and,
i
think
that
congress
meant
--
i
think
that
the
congress,
in
1811
and
in
those
days
when
the
only
mode
of
transportation
in
our
area
of
the
country
that
meant
anything
was
by
water,
i
think
that
they
didn't
use
words
carelessly
with
respect
to
the
three
great
states
of
louisiana,
mississippi,
and
alabama.
i
think
they
knew
what
they
were
talking
about.
and,
i
think
that
when
they
talk
about
our
coast
and
the
--
talk
about
the
shores
of
mississippi
and
the
shores
of
alabama,
they
understood
that
there
was
a
difference
and
they
didn't
use
the
words
meaninglessly
but
meaningfully.
and,
i
think
we
ought
to
be
permitted
to
show
that
and
to
show
that,
through
out
in
dealing
with
louisiana
and
from
the
very
beginning,
that
the
congress
has
always
talked
about
our
coast
as
distinguished
from
our
shore.
now,
i
would
like
to
go
a
little
bit
further
back.
i'd
like
to
go
to
what
i
grew
up
calling
the
louisiana
purchase
but
what
we
now
call
the
louisiana
session.
and,
when
that
wonderful
act
was
written
in
1803,
france
ceded
to
us
not
only
the
mainland,
but
they
said
in
the
session
made
by
the
preceding
article
are
included
the
adjacent
islands.
now,
i
--
i
emphasize
the
word
“adjacent”
because,
to
me
as
a
lawyer
and
to
your
honors
as
justices,
i
am
sure
it
has
a
significant
meaning.
adjacent,
to
me,
means
in
join
--
adjoining,
that
there
is
not
something
separating
one
from
the
other.
and
france
ceded
to
us
this
mainland
and
the
adjacent
islands.
it
didn't
say
within
three
leagues.
it
didn't
say
within
10
leagues.
it
didn't
say
within
20
leagues.
but,
it
said
the
adjacent
islands
as
a
part
and
parcel
of
the
same
thing,
that
the
hare
was
going
with
the
hide,
and
the
united
states
got
all
of
it
--
all
of
these
islands.well,
where
were
they?
when
the
united
states
undertook
to
form
louisiana
within
certain
limits
under
the
enabling
act
of
february
1911,
the
united
states
drew
a
line
not
just
the
congress,
but
the
president,
the
entire
political
branches
of
the
government
drew
a
line
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
they
said
three
leagues
from
coast.
and,
they
did
the
same
thing
when
they
got
to
mississippi
and
when
they
got
to
alabama,
expect
that
they
said
six
leagues
from
shore.
but,
they
were
drawing
a
line
because
everyone
must
have
believed
then
that
in
order
for
the
united
states
to
own
these
islands
in
the
gulf
of
mexico,
at
least
those
acquired
by
purchase
from
france
under
the
language
i
have
just
read,
that
for
us
to
own
them,
we
own
them
as
a
part
of
that
purchase.
and,
when
they
established
the
state
of
louisiana,
these
islands
adjacent
--
adjacent
to
the
mainland,
those
surrounded
by
water
at
the
surface
of
the
water,
were
given
to
us
and
that
carried
the
submerged
land
with
it
as
clearly
as
could
be.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
i'd
like
to
draw
a
distinction
between
the
language,
if
i
may.
in
our
treaty
with
england,
the
people
who
drew
that
act
said
north
america
and
all
islands
within
20
leagues
of
the
--
of
the
shore
or
maybe
all
islands
within
20
leagues
of
the
coast,
and
there
could
have
been
an
international
belt
in
between
because
that
didn't
say
adjacent
islands.
but,
in
our
case
--
in
our
case,
the
descriptive
words,
and
this
was
a
big
land
deal
and
then
people
were
trying
to
be
careful
and
talk
about
what
they
meant,
and
it
was
an
important
land
deal
to
the
united
states
because,
from
the
very
beginning
of
our
independence,
our
people
started
talking
about
an
outlet
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
through
the
mississippi.
and,
i
remember
that,
in
the
very
year
of
our
independence,
mr.
morrison
wrote
to
mr.
jefferson
and
said,
“we'd
have
to
have
it,
and
if
you
can't
get
it
at
new
orleans,
get
it
at
baton
rouge,”
which
is
my
home
town.
and,
from
--
from
the
beginning,
they
knew
that
they
had
to
get
to
the
open
sea
that
there
were
not
to
be
left
any
belt
between
them
and
the
open
sea.
the
open
sea
was
the
--
was
the
travel
lane
by
which
people
leave,
and
we
were
going
there
by
one
means
or
another.
in
my
part
of
the
state,
the
florida
parishes,
the
people
seized
the
government
and
invited
the
united
states
in
because
united
states
didn't
claim
it
at
once.
the
title
to
it
was
clarified
later
and
--
and,
so,
we
have
the
florida
parishes
because
there
was
a
doubt.
but,
at
least
as
to
the
sea,
there
was
no
doubt
because
that's
where
they
were
going
and
they
bought
the
mainland
and
the
adjacent
islands
out
to
the
open
sea,
and
they
meant
to
give
it
to
us
because
there
was
no
other
state
to
use
that
territory
below
or
south
of
louisiana.
now,
i'd
like
to
say
this.
the
--
when
the
congress,
in
1811,
said
that
we
were
to
have
a
state,
listen
to
the
language
they
used.
the
area
contained
within
the
following
limits,
and
then
they
set
the
limits.
that's
on
page
70
of
our
brief
--
of
our
appendix
--
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
and,
they
set
the
limits
and
they
described
these
limits
as
surely
and
as
definitely,
and
as
clearly
as
people
could
do
it
now.
i
agree
that
the
submerged
lands
didn't
attract
the
attention
that
the
waters
did
in
those
days.
but,
certainly,
no
one
had
in
mind
that
there
was
a
foreign
belt
or
an
international
belt
between
our
mainland
and
islands
adjacent
to
our
coast.
and,
when
they
said
three
leagues
from
our
coast
in
the
enabling
act,
they
were
drawing,
and
we
can
prove
that
they
were
drawing,
a
line
which
encompassed
the
islands
as
they
had
been
were.
and,
i
say
that
by
any
legal
tests,
louisiana
is
entitled
to
that
much.
i
--
i
believe
that
mr.
wilkinson
had
made
it
abundantly
clear
that
every
official
act
of
our
government
concerning
the
gulf
of
mexico,
including
the
submerged
lands
act
which
comes
from
the
congress
and
from
the
president,
set
three
leagues
as
our
measure.
i
say
it
would
be
utterly
meaningless
to
say
that
louisiana
is
to
have
these
adjacent
islands
--
adjacent
islands
but
not
the
land
under
the
water
which
makes
them
adjacent.
if
that
land
were
in
some
international
area,
the
islands
could
not
be
adjacent.
and,
i
think
we
are
entitled
to
so
much.
i
should
like
to
close
this
way.
the
government's
brief
here,
the
last
brief,
on
page
3
talks
about
“the
additional
provisions
the
gulf
states
could
obtain
submerged
land
out
to
three
leagues
if
they
could
prove
that
they
had
boundaries
that
far
out
when
they
entered
the
union
or
if
such
boundaries
were
thereafter
approved
by
congress
did
not
reflect
a
congressional
view
that
such
boundaries
were
possible.
i
do
not
think
that
this
court
can
accept
the
view
that
the
congress
and
the
president
satisfied
the
gulf
state
by
presenting
a
will
of
the
wisp
that
could
not
be
realized.
i
think
we
are
entitled
to
proof.
i
think
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
enabling
act
considered
with
the
purchase
proves
of
itself
that
we
have
three
leagues
and
three
leagues
from
the
coast
because
that
is
the
language
of
the
enabling
act.
i
think
all
that
really
and
rightfully
remains
is
for
us
to
show
where
is
the
coast,
and
i
hope
this
court
will
give
us
the
opportunity
to
do
that.
