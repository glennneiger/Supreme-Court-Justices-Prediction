mr.
a.
l.
wirin
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
as
the
preceding
one
and
as
the
one
to
follow,
deals
with
a
subsection
of
section
401
of
the
nationality
act
of
1940
which
involves
a
loss
of
citizenship.
the
subsection
here
is
401
(c)
which
provides
the
loss
of
united
states
citizenship
by
an
american
citizen
who
serves
in
a
foreign
army
and
who
at
the
same
is
a
citizen
of
that
foreign
state.
we
have
raised
the
constitutionality
on
its
face
of
this
subsection
in
our
brief
and
since
the
constitutional
question
has
been
argued
substantially
in
the
former
case
and
will
also
be
considered
in
the
next
case,
i
am
not
going
to
discuss
that
feature
of
this
case.
i'm
going
to
address
myself
particularly
to
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
indicated
with
the
due
process
features
of
this
statute
as
applied
to
the
petitioner.
i'm
going
to
assume
the
power
of
congress
to
legislate
in
the
field,
(a)
of
persons
serving
in
a
foreign
army
abroad,
(b)
where
those
persons
have
dual
nation
--
dual
nationality.
i'm
going
to
assume
the
--
the
making
of
broad
power
and
i'm
going
to
urge
upon
your
honors
that
that
power
was
not
properly
exercised
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned
because
it
was
exercised
in
a
manner
to
be
unreasonable
and
to
offend
due
process.
more
particularly,
to
narrow
my
point
and
to
narrow
the
problem,
i'm
going
to
be
dealing
with
a
question
which
mr.
justice
harlan
has
with
respect
to
the
matter
of
in
--
of
voluntariness
and
involuntariness.
and
i
want
to
make
at
the
very
beginning
a
distinction
which
to
me
seems
to
be
cardinal
in
connection
with
the
use
of
the
word
“voluntariness
or
involuntariness”
because
it
can
be
used
in
two
separate
contexts
and
with
two
separate
meanings.
for
instance,
whether
or
not
a
person,
when
he
does
something,
intends
to
lose
his
citizenship
or
as
one
of
the
cases
that
concurs
in
the
loss
of
his
citizenship
by
doing
something.
this
is
one
example
of
voluntariness.
for
the
purpose
of
my
argument,
i'm
going
to
assume
that
this
is
utterly
inconsequential
and
that
in
that
context,
he
may
lose
his
citizenship
though
his
--
though
he
--
he
doesn't
want
to,
though
it
is
involuntary.
but
when
congress
undertakes
to
specify
various
grounds
for
the
loss
of
citizenship
which
it
did
in
this
--
section
401
of
which
(c)
is
an
--
an
example.
and
it
provides
that
merely
doing
that
which
congress
says,
if
done,
results
in
loss
of
citizenship.it
is
clear
and
it
is
undisputed
by
the
government
that
that
act
which
congress
defines
must
be
voluntary.
for
instance,
if
it's
a
question
of
service
in
the
armed
forces
of
another
country,
the
government
concedes
there
could
be
no
loss
of
citizenship
if
the
service
was
involuntary,
if
the
service
in
the
armed
forces.
so
in
that
respect
and
in
this
narrow
fashion,
voluntariness
is
important,
it
is
conceded
and
it
is
the
heart
of
the
petitioner's
case
so
far
as
this
--
this
case
is
concerned.
because
we
say
that
in
the
trial
below
under
section
503,
the
trial
court
in
ultimately
ruling
that
the
petitioner
voluntarily
served
in
the
armed
forces
of
japan,
ignored
and
violated
the
rules
laid
down
by
this
court
as
to
the
quantum
and
burden
and
nature
of
the
truth
which
is
upon
the
government
where
the
stakes
are
deprivation
and
forfeiture
of
this
most
precious
of
rights,
the
rights
of
citizenship,
that
the
court
below
laid
down
an
incorrect
rule
of
law
as
to
where
the
burden
of
proof
was.
it
followed
an
incorrect
rule
of
law
so
far
as
any
presumption
that
might
follow
upon
a
showing
that
the
petitioner
--
the
petitioner
served
in
a
foreign
army
or
developed
conscription
and
that
in
any
event,
the
court
below
ruled
against
to
the
petitioner
without
complying
with
the
standards
imposed
by
this
court
in
connection
both
with
persons
who
were
citizens
by
naturalization
or
by
birth,
namely
that
the
evidence
against
the
petitioner
and
in
favor
of
the
government,
is
not
clear
and
convincing
and
unequivocal
to
warrant
the
forfeiture
of
this
precious
right.
now,
fortunately,
we
have
here
a
record
of
some
40
pages,
not
the
15,000-page
record
to
which
your
honors
wrestled
with
in
--
in
gates
versus
united
states
and
the
record
is
before
your
honors
and
in
a
moment
i
want
to
refer
to
it.i
mean
the
record
of
the
trial
as
compared
to
our
brief,
it
is
some
--
some
40
pages
in
that.
first,
with
respect
to
a
couple
of
propositions
of
law
and
then
i
want
to
deal
with
these
propositions
of
law
as
reflected
by
the
facts
in
this
case.
we
say
that
where
the
government
says
that
an
american
has
lost
his
citizenship
by
virtue
of
doing
something
which
so
far
as
the
citizen
is
concerned,
is
not
accompanied
by
any
knowledge
on
his
part
that
he
is
forfeiting
or
abandoning
or
affecting
his
citizenship
that
as
a
minimum,
the
burden
of
proof
that
the
petitioner
has
committed
the
act
proscribed
and
set
forth
in
the
statute,
voluntarily
that
that
burden
is
upon
the
government.
now,
additionally
we
say
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no.
we
say
it
is
not
exception
to
the
rule
in
other
types
of
cases
that
are
analogous.
we
say
it
is
the
rule
because
we
say
that
this
court
has
defined
expatriation
as
the
voluntary
renunciation
or
abandonment
of
united
states
citizenship.
this
is
the
phrase
that
chief
justice
hughes
used
in
(inaudible).
we
say
that
the
act
of
expatriation,
that's
what's
involved
here,
losing
your
--
your
citizenship,
is
an
act
which
must
be
voluntary
in
order
for
it
to
consist
of
an
act
of
expatriation.
and
if
the
government
says,
i
--
anyone
here,
has
lost
his
citizenship
and
has
expatriated
himself,
it
must
prove
that
the
act
which
the
citizen
committed
was
voluntary
and
not
involuntary.
i
think
--
in
other
words,
we
say
one
of
the
elements,
one
of
the
inherent
and
indispensible
elements
of
expatriation
is
voluntariness.
the
burden
of
proof
on
which
is
upon
the
government,
the
same
that
it
has
a
burden
of
proving
that
--
that
the
person
did
--
did
something
which
the
act
proscribes.
so
we
are
--
we
do
not
say
that
we're
asking
for
an
exception.
we're
simply
saying
that
this
is
part
of
the
definition
of
voluntariness
which
--
which
is
inherent
in
the
definition.
but
in
any
event,
even
if
we're
mistaken
about
that,
there's
a
serious
question
in
this
case
with
respect
to
the
presumption
which
a
court
should
draw,
we
say
must
draw,
where
in
a
case
like
ours,
the
--
excuse
me,
the
evidence
of
the
petitioner
as
a
citizen
of
united
states,
born
in
united
states.
the
evidence
is
that
he
served
in
a
foreign
army
but
that
he
served
solely
by
virtue
of
conscription,
that
is,
you
received
an
order
from
a
foreign
army
to
--
to
appear
for
induction.we
say
and
we
think
all
of
the
circuits
with
the
exception
of
the
circuit
below
in
this
case
take
the
view
that
upon
that
showing,
there
has
been
a
showing
by
the
petitioner
of
involuntariness
and
that
the
burden
then
shifts
to
the
government
to
--
to
rebut
the
presumption
of
involuntariness
which
that
showing
makes,
and
this
was
the
showing
here.
but
then
we
say
finally
--
well
of
course,
i'm
not
proving
my
argument.our
--
our
central
point
is
that
irrespective
of
where
the
burden
of
proof
is,
assuming
now,
i'm
entirely
an
error
and
assuming
i'm
merging
upon
your
honors
which
i
believe
i
am
not,
an
exception
and
that
we're
wrong
about
it
and
that
the
burden
is
upon
the
petitioner
in
a
general
way
to
carry
his
burden
of
this
case.
we
say
that
all
of
the
evidence,
some
40
pages,
if
looked
at
by
the
court
will
bring
this
court
as
a
minimum
to
have
a
troubling
doubt
as
to
whether
there
were
sufficient
evidence
to
justify
the
forfeiture
of
--
of
citizenship.
and
in
baumgartner
and
other
cases,
your
honors
have
reviewed
judgments
both
by
trial
and
appellate
courts,
findings
against
the
citizen,
baumgartner
a
naturalized
citizen
and
gonzales,
the
last
nationality
case
argued
before
your
honors
which
you
decided
per
curiam.
when
born
in
united
states,
you've
taken
the
view
--
and
in
--
in
gonzales,
you
cited
baumgartner
that
if
your
honors
look
at
a
case,
even
though
it
comes
here
in
case
in
the
armor
of
finding
by
--
by
lower
(inaudible)
both
of
them
and
you
have
a
troubling
doubt
as
to
whether
there
should
have
been
a
forfeiture,
you
will
reverse
the
judgment.
let
me
go
on
to
what
the
facts
are
in
this
case.
as
i've
said,
one,
this
boy
was
born
in
the
united
states
and
was
an
american
citizen
by
virtue
thereof.
he
was
also
a
dual
citizen
by
virtue
of
no
conduct
on
his
part,
by
virtue
of
nothing
that
he
did.
he
was
a
dual
citizen
because
the
government
of
japan,
prior
to
the
war,
said
by
its
laws
that
every
person
born
in
united
states
of
japanese
ancestry
was
a
citizen
of
that
country.
he
was
a
dual
citizen
because
--
he
was
a
dual
citizen
without
his
knowledge
or
consent.
because
his
father,
in
accordance
with
the
practice,
of
thousands
of
nisei
in
the
united
states,
before
he
was
14
days
of
age,
went
down
and
registered
--
registered
his
name
in
the
koseki
or
in
the
--
or
in
the
japanese
family
register.
he
got
his
education
in
the
united
states.
he's
a
graduate
of
the
university
of
california.
he
went
to
japan
in
1939.
he
had
no
ties
in
japan.
he
went
to
japan
as
thousands
of
nisei
went
to
japan
at
the
request
of
their
parents,
their
passage
paid
by
their
parents
to
secure
some
education
and
to
have
a
visit.
he
went
there
for
the
purpose
of
staying
two
to
five
years
temporarily
and
his
passport
application
--
and
his
passport
shows
it.
he
went
there
as
an
american
citizen
and
only
as
an
american
citizen.
he
had
no
time
either
here
or
in
japan
ever
asserted
any
right
as
a
japanese
citizen
or
claimed
any
privilege
or
desired
any
benefit
because
he
was
a
japanese
citizen.
it
is
urged
by
the
government
that
when
he
went
to
japan
in
1939,
he
knew
that
he
was
a
japanese
citizen.
the
record
does
not
support
that.
the
record
is
to
the
effect
that
when
he
was
in
japan,
he
discovered
that
he
was
a
dual
citizen
solely
because
his
name
was
on
the
--
on
the
family
register.
he
was
then
under
no
obligation
to
render
any
military
service
in
the
united
states.
the
united
states
conscription
law
hasn't
been
passed.
he
couldn't
have
known
that
he
was
endangering
his
citizenship
when
he
went
to
united
--
when
he
went
to
japan
or
when
he
was
conscripted
in
the
japanese
army
because
the
nationality
act
which
provides
for
your
loss
of
citizenship
wasn't
even
adopted
at
the
time
he
went
to
--
he
went
to
japan.
he
was
being
supported
by
his
father.and
one
thing
he
couldn't
foresee
is
that
his
father
would
die
three
months
after
he
was
in
japan
to
leave
him
penniless.
and
in
1940,
he
received
a
notice
from
the
japanese
army
to
appear
for
a
physical
examination,
and
in
march
1941,
he
was
ordered
--
inducted.
now,
we
say
this
was
involuntary,
just
as
involuntary
as
this
court
has
often
said
when
a
person
received
the
subpoena
and
he
appears
as
a
witness,
he
isn't
appearing
voluntarily.
he
is
appearing
under
coercion.
and
the
decisions
have
been
uniform
in
the
recent
years
that
where
a
service
in
a
foreign
army
is
under
coercion,
it
is
not
the
kind
of
voluntary
conduct
which
is
indispensible
to
warrant
a
forfeiture
of
citizenship.
mr.
justice
harlan,
let
me
make
one
further
explanation.
the
argument
that
a
citizen's
rights
can
be
taken
away
from
him
completely
involuntary,
namely,
that
if
he
serves
in
a
foreign
army
and
he
is
conscripted
in
a
foreign
army
and
is
coerced
by
physical
violence
in
a
foreign
army
that
nonetheless
he
loses
his
citizenship
and
that
401
(c)
so
provides
is
the
very
argument
that
government
made
some
years
ago
in
a
case
known
as
dos
reis
versus
nicolls
which
we
cite.
and
the
court
--
court
of
appeals
there
rejected
the
argument
that
it
is
either
constitutional
or
--
or
believable
that
congress
no
matter
its
authority
to
--
over
foreign
relation
and
no
matter
his
legitimate
concern
to
prevent
conflicts
between
his
country
and
another,
that
congress
could
go
to
that
extent.
the
court
in
dos
reis
versus
nicolls
didn't
say
it.
it
wasn't
going
to
say
it
now,
a
justice
of
this
court
did.
the
point
is
that
this
would
be
offensive
to
common
decency
and
--
and
elementary
fair
play.
so
that
we
say
up
to
this
point,
the
evidence
of
involuntariness
was
reasonably
persuasive.
we
say
that
it
became
conclusive
as
a
result
of
further
testimony.
this
boy
testified
--
well
let
me
perhaps
withdraw
that
and
--
and
develop
the
argument
this
way.
the
trial
court
found
against
the
plaintiff,
against
the
petitioner,
and
he
did
so,
we
think,
as
a
result
of
a
--
of
a
misapprehension
as
to
the
duties
of
a
citizen
living
abroad
and
a
misapprehension
after
the
applicable
rules
in
this
kind
of
a
case.
the
trial
judge
was
at
the
view
that
this
petitioner
lost
his
citizenship,
although
there's
no
question
he
was
conscripted
into
the
japanese
army
because
the
petitioner
refrained
from
doing
certain
things
which
he
think
what
the
judge
thought
a
citizen
should
do.
in
the
first
place,
the
trial
judge
was
at
the
view
that
the
petitioner
should
have
returned
to
the
united
states
instead
of
staying
in
japan.
we
think
this
is
utterly
unrealistic
and
quite
unfair.
in
the
first
place,
we
wouldn't
then
not
at
war
with
japan.
we
didn't
even
have
a
conscription
law.
the
united
states
government
has
recognized
dual
citizenship
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
a
few
--
few
moment
ago.
there
he
was
in
japan
and
he
got
a
notice
to
serve
in
the
japanese
army.
at
that
time,
there
wasn't
--
such
service
was
not
inconsistent
with
any
allegiance
he
had
to
united
states.
and
certainly,
he
cannot
be
charged
with
the
lack
of
prescience
to
foretell
that
a
couple
of
years
afterwards,
there
would
be
a
war
between
united
states
and
japan.
he'd
made
no
effort
to
return
to
this
country
but
he
explained
the
reason
he
didn't
is
because
he
was
penniless,
funds
from
his
father
had
stopped,
he
went
to
work
and
he
was
earning
70
yen
a
month,
$15
a
month
and
he
didn't
have
the
fair
to
get
home
so
he
stayed
on.
and
of
course
if
he
attempted
to
leave
after
he
got
a
notice
to
appear
for
physical
examination,
well,
certainly
the
same
thing
would
have
happened
to
him
that
happens
to
americans
who
try
to
leave
to
--
to
evade
--
evade
the
draft.
the
trial
judge
held
it
against
him
that
he
didn't
do
one
other
thing
--
didn't
do
three
other
things,
that
he
didn't
go
down
to
the
united
states
consulate
and
assert
his
rights
there.
and
there
are
two
answers
to
this
claim.
one
is
that
he
--
as
he
testified,
had
a
friend
who
worked
in
the
embassy
and
the
united
states
embassy
point
to
this
friend
who
do
nothing
for
persons
who
were
in
japan.
some
intimation,
some
claim,
had
made
by
the
judge
and
some
intimation
appears
in
the
government's
brief
that
had
he
gone
down
to
united
states
consul,
the
consul
could
have
granted
him
some
relief.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
that
the
state
department
had
formally
announced
that
it
would
not
help
any
persons
in
japan
who
were
being
drafted
in
the
japanese
army.
furthermore,
he
testified
that
he
didn't
protest
to
the
japanese
authorities
because
he
was
afraid.
and
he
was
afraid
not
only
of
the
penal
sanctions
which
accompany
this
--
the
--
the
conscription
law
of
japan
but
he
was
afraid
of
extra
penal
sanction
by
the
kempei
tai,
the
japanese
military
police.
that
--
he
knew
that
the
boarding
house
where
he
was
living
had
been
visited
by
the
japanese
military
police
and
that
he
had
heard
rumors,
he
didn't
know
whether
they
were
true
or
not
that
persons
who
attempted
to
evade
the
japanese
military
system,
this
is
1940,
this
is
while
japan
is
under
control
as
we
--
we
--
which
is
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
of
a
--
of
a
ruthless
military
cast
that
he
had
heard
that
the
kempei
tai
had
pursued
some
persons
who
are
evading
the
draft.
and
in
one
instance
they
suspected
that
a
person
was
hiding
in
a
trunk
filled
with
straw
and
they
bayoneted
the
trunk
and
killed
the
person
who
was
in
it.
now,
he
didn't
see
this
but
he
was
afraid
of
it
and
we
have
submitted
to
the
clerk
of
this
court,
documents,
official
report
of
the
united
states
government
through
scap,
supreme
command
of
allied
headquarters
--
general
macarthur's
headquarters
with
respect
of
the
conduct
of
the
kempei
tai
so
far
as
the
japanese
people
generally
were
concerned
and
particularly
the
nisei
who
were
--
who
were
living
in
japan.
now,
the
judge
went
further.
the
judge
said
that
when
this
boy
went
to
japan
--
went
to
japan,
he
went
there
for
the
purpose
of
doing
his
hitch
in
the
japanese
army.
there
isn't
the
slightest
evidence
to
warrant
any
such
finding
of
any
such
opinion.
the
difficulty
as
i
view
it
with
the
judge
below
if
i
may
be
both
superstitious
and
serious
at
the
same
time,
is
that
he
gave
too
much
credit
to
the
university
of
california.
this
boy
has
graduated
from
the
university
of
california.
and
because
he
was
a
graduate
from
the
university
of
california
and
went
to
japan
when
--
when
he
was
23,
this
judge
said,
"this
boy
is
a
bright
man."
he
said
he
is
a
graduate
of
one
of
our
greatest
institutions
of
learning
in
this
country
and
so
he
proceeded
to
a
court
to
this
petitioner
and
knowledge
of
political
affairs
or
wisdom
pertaining
to
them
and
oppressions
of
possible
conflict
between
united
states
and
japan.
as
a
result
of
which,
he
felt
--
this
boy
knew
more
than
he
--
than
met
the
eye
and
therefore,
he
arrived
to
the
conclusion
that
he
must
have
known
many
things
which
--
which
were
not
clear
and
therefore,
he
lost
his
citizenship.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
if
that
testimony
were
cut
out,
there
would
be
nothing
in
the
record
because
the
only
testimony
comes
from
the
lips
of
the
petitioner.
if
the
trial
judge
disbelieve
the
petitioner
then
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
warrant
a
forfeiture
of
citizenship
because
then,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
the
petitioner
has
acted
voluntarily
and
the
government
hasn't
carried
any
of
the
--
any
burden
not
even
the
most
minimum
burden
which
this
court
has
said
it
must
carry
in
order
for
a
loss
of
citizenship.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
sir.
well
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
in
a
brief
would,
i
think
all
of
the
cross-examination
elicited
was,
one,
was
some
of
the
things
i
have
recounted.
he
was
a
graduate
of
the
university.
two,
that
he
knew
that
japan
was
engaged
in
war
in
manchuria.
he
denied
that
he
knew
that
he
was
subject
to
conscription
and
the
judge
--
judge
doesn't
--
the
judge
however,
makes
a
finding
that
he
did
know
he
was
subject
to
conscription
in
--
in
japan.
the
further
import
of
a
cross-examination
would
be
to
the
effect
that
he
communicated
with
his
family
and
with
friends
in
the
united
states
from
which
--
and
he
was
asked
whether
or
not
he
didn't
know
that
there
was
a
draft
in
the
united
states.
this
is
after
1940.
he
said,
no,
they
didn't
tell
him
that.
now,
i
--
i
can't
see
much
more.
i'm
sure
the
--
the
solicitor
general
or
assistant
general
will
see
much
more
on
the
cross-examination,
will
answer
your
honor's
question
better
than
i.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
okimura
and
murata
cases,
as
i
think
perhaps,
the
solicitor
said,
judge
maclaughlin
found
that
there
was
no
duress
and
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional,
the
government
did
not
appeal
there
that
both
of
these
petitioners,
those
persons
are
now
american
citizens
that
this
petitioner
would
like
to
be.
and
if
this
petitioner
remains
an
american
citizen,
then
317
(c)
is
no
--
no
longer
the
law,
it
will
be
only
by
virtue
of
the
--
of
the
justice
and
--
or
generosity
by
the
justice
of
this
court.
now,
i
mean
--
i
mean
if
he
loses
this
case,
he's
--
he's
lost
his
american
citizenship
and
he's
on
his
way
back
to
japan.that's
what
i'm
trying
to
say,
your
honor.
now
then,
to
--
to
answer
some
--
some
questions
asked
by
justices
of
the
court
in
colloquy,
first
with
respect
to
the
problem
of
believing
to
the
--
the
petitioner.
it
is
true
that
the
district
judge
said
he
didn't
believe
the
petitioner.
indeed,
that's
what
the
district
judge
said
also
in
the
gonzales
case.
but
it's
impossible
to
tell
from
what
the
district
judge
said
what
he
believed
and
what
he
didn't
and
what
the
solicitor
has
done
is
picked
out
the
things
that
he
doesn't
like
and
say
that
the
district
judge
didn't
believe
them.
and
of
course,
as
already
stated,
if
the
district
judge
believed
the
petitioner
completely
and
it's
conceded
the
petitioner
is
a
citizen
of
united
states
and
if
everything
else
is
rejected
from
the
case,
the
petitioner
remains
a
citizen
of
united
states
and
the
judgment
should
have
been
for
him.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
he
could
but
i'm
saying
the
record
isn't
clear
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
now,
a
question
was
asked
by
mr.
justice
warren
as
to
what
the
state
department's
position
would
have
been.
on
page
28
of
our
brief
is
a
reference
to
this
--
to
a
statement
appearing
in
the
state
department
publication,
page
28,
in
which
the
state
department
said,
"it
is
not
the
practice
of
the
state
department
to
make
representations
with
respect
to
dual
citizens
with
respect
to
their
obligations
to
other
countries."
the
solicitor
has
said
that
a
number
of
persons
have
returned
from
--
from
japan
after
they
--
presumably
after
they
received
word
of
conscription.
i
know
of
none.
i
do
know
that
the
law
of
japan
which
is
set
forth
in
the
transcript
at
page
23,
article
74
and
it's
in
the
--
in
this
record,
specifically
provide
that
any
evasion
of
military
service
by
deserting
or
hiding
and
so
forth
will
be
punished
to
penal
servitude
of
three
years
or
less.
this
is
aside
of
any
--
of
any
non-penal
sanctions
which
might
come
from
the
kempei
tai.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
page
28.
excuse
me.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
page
23
of
the
record.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
i'm
going
to
rest
on
his
argument
to
this
extent
that
in
his
brief,
he
makes
the
distinction
between
a
person
being
a
dual
national
through
fiat
of
foreign
government
or
conduct
by
his
father
when
he
is
innocent
and
voluntary
action
in
acquiring
dual
nationality.
in
other
words,
we
would
concede
that
if
this
petitioner
did
some
voluntary
act
acquiring
dual
nationality,
he
would
be
in
a
very
different
position
from
--
from
what
he
is
now
but
we
say
that
there's
no
such
thing
in
this
record.
now,
with
respect
to
the
matter
of
judicial
notice
and
the
matter
of
conditions
in
japan,
i
appreciate
the
compliment
the
solicitor
paid
me
as
being
one
qualified
to
try
this
cases,
i
did
not
try
this
case.
one
of
my
younger
colleagues
did.
he
was
just
out
of
the
law
school
and
he
neglected
to
offer
some
things
that
were
offered
in
other
case.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
am
not
here
to
cast
stones
on
that
petition.
in
any
event
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
in
any
event,
your
honor,
we
have
in
an
appendix
to
our
brief
which
is
the
blue
brief,
given
to
the
court
extracts
from
official
government
documents
with
respect
to
conditions
in
japan
and
the
role
of
the
kempei
tai.
we
think
they
are
the
subject
of
judicial
notice
and
they
are
to
the
effect
that
one
who
didn't
comply
with
the
conscription
law
of
japan
not
only
run
the
risk
of
going
to
jail
but
took
his
life
in
his
own
hands
so
far
as
the
conduct
of
the
japanese
military
police
are
concerned.
and
now,
one
--
one
final
word,
in
mandoli
versus
acheson,
this
court
had
before
it
an
american
who
served
in
the
italian
army
and
he
took
an
oath
of
allegiance
while
he
was
in
the
italian
army.
in
that
case,
the
attorney
general
or
solicitor
general
confessed
error
with
respect
to
that
portion
of
the
case
because
the
attorney
general
had
ruled
that
with
respect
to
taking
of
an
oath
in
the
--
in
the
italian
army,
i'm
referring
to
a
matter
which
appears
on
page
24
of
our
blue
brief,
the
attorney
general
had
ruled
the
choice
of
taking
the
oath
or
violating
the
law
for
a
soldier
in
the
army
of
fascist
italy
was
no
choice
at
all.
and
our
position
is
that
under
all
of
the
evidence
in
this
case,
the
choice
of
an
american
citizen
who
happened
to
be
a
dual
citizen
by
virtue
of
the
act
of
his
father
when
he
was
an
infant.
in
japan,
when
he
received
a
one-way
ticket,
an
order
of
conscription,
the
choice
of
his
not
complying
with
the
order
was
no
choice
at
all.
he
was
under
duress
and
we
think
the
evidence
in
his
place
disposes
duress
and
that
the
petitioner
is
entitled
to
his
citizenship.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that
is
not
in
this
case.
