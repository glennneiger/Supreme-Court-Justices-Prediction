petitioner,
versus
john
foster
dulles,
secretary
of
state.
mr.
okrand.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
what
would
have
happened
to
him
in
japan
if
he
had
not
--
if
he
had
refused
to
go
into
the
service?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
is
it?
well,
then
don't
bother,
you
go
head
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
--
was
the
petitioner's
word
contradicted
in
anyway
or
is
it
--
was
that
an
inference
from
the
judge?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
--
and
that
was
before
we
were
at
war
with
japan?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
--
mr.
okrand,
do
you
ask
anymore
than
that
this
case
should
go
back
for
hearing
by
the
court
below
to
determine
whether
he
did
in
--
in
fact
voluntarily
--
voluntarily
join
the
army
and
leaving
the
burden
to
the
government
as
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
let's
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
he
voluntarily
went
into
the
japanese
army
and
voluntarily
fought
throughout
the
--
the
war.
do
you
--
would
you
concede
then
that
the
government
had
the
right
to
denaturalize
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
concede
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
you
would
raise
a
constitutional
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
question
and
mr.
horsky
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say
apparently,
is
there
--
is
the
law
so
state
over
there
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
1941,
he
was
--
the
japanese
empire
was
in
alliance
with
hitler,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
he
have
refused
to
be
examined?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
hadn't
--
if
he
hadn't,
would
they
put
him
in
jail?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
might
not
the
country
that
a
man
is
in
have
a
lot
to
do
with
whether
he
would
--
he
would
go
now
and
seeking
information?
if
he
was
in
nazi,
germany,
it
might
be
a
lot
different
from
whether
he
was
in
--
in
the
south
american
republic
or
some
other
country.
being
in
japan
might
make
a
lot
of
difference
too
in
view
of
the
--
the
attitude
of
the
government
and
the
japanese
people
at
that
particular
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
except
that
he
--
he
might
lose
his
head
by
it
but
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
[laughs]
yes,
indeed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
at
what
--
in
what
years,
do
you
know?
is
it
in
1941?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mitsugi
nishikawa,
petitioner,
versus
john
foster
dulles,
secretary
of
state.
mr.
davis,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
stay
with
that
one
just
for
a
minute,
what
does
the
statute
say
you
must
prove?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
a
little
more
to
it
than
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
just
--
it
just
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
okrand.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
give
it
to
us
again
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
what
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
number
44
--
no,
no.
number

i
beg
your
pardon.
number
19,
mitsugi
nishikawa,
petitioner,
versus
john
foster
dulles.
mr.
wirin.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
what
--
what
evidence
did
he
base
that
finding
on?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
understood
you
to
say
when
he
left
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
this
country.
now
let's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
let's
take
it
right
from
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
that
point
on,
what
--
what
evidence
the
judge
used
to
support
that
finding.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
he
went
to
the
japanese
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
there
evidence
to
show
that
he
did
know
it
when
he
left
this
country
as
you
said.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
the
--
what
was
the
evidence
to
the
effect
that
--
that
he
knew
he
was
a
japanese
citizen
at
the
time
he
went
into
the
army.
no,
i
don't
--
i
don't
question
it's
there,
but
i
mean
just
what
is
the
character
of
the
evidence
that
the
judge
used
to
relate
it
back
to
1939?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
take
question
two.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
--
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
may
i
ask
this
question,
mr.
davis.
suppose
he
had
gone
to
the
american
consulate
after
he
received
notice
to
go
into
the
japanese
army
or
to
come
for
--
for
physical
examination,
will
he
have
had
any
right
under
international
law
to
--
through
our
consul
to
be
sent
home?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
may
do
a
feudal
thing
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
would
take
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
would
take
your
citizenship
away
from
him
because
he
didn't
do
a
feudal
thing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
there
is
no
--
if
there
is
no
legal
right
for
him
to
go
home,
if
it
would
have
been
dishonored
and
if
he
would've
put
himself
in
--
in
difficulties
with
the
japanese
regime,
does
the
government
expect
him
at
the
expense
of
his
--
his
safety
to
go
to
the
american
consul
and
ask
them
to
see
whether
he
goes
home
when
the
government
knows
that
it
can
do
nothing
for
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
somebody
had
any
difficulties?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
he
said
also
that
he
was
working
out
in
the
country,
a
good
many
miles
from
the
city
that
he
didn't
read
any
japanese
papers
because
he
didn't
--
he
didn't
understand
the
--
the
characters
and
that
for
that
reason,
he
didn't
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
true,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
the
truth.
they
couldn't
do
anything
for
him.
chief
justice
earl
warren
after
they
were
summoned
into
the
japanese
army?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
was
ordered
for
examination
more
than
a
year,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
before
--
more
than
a
year
before
we
could
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but,
i
couldn't
conflict
it
about
what
he
says
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
he
was
ordered
--
ordered
up
before
that.
the
year
before
we
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
a
man
leaves
--
leaves
this
country
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
he's
ordered
up
for
examination.
chief
justice
earl
warren
don't
say
it,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may.
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
wirin.
