mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
particular
facts
of
this
case
are
very
important
because
we
have
here
of
the
findings
of
a
trial
judge
after
a
trial
adverse
to
the
petitioner,
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
as
amply
supported
by
the
evidence.
and
so
there
is
to
a
certain
extent
the
invocation
of
the
two-court
rule
relating
to
findings
of
fact
upheld
by
two
courts
below.
the
undisputed
facts
are
these.
petitioner
was
born
in
the
united
states
in
the
state
of
california.
he
was
educated
here.
he
went
to
the
university
of
california
and
secured
an
engineering
degree.
in
august
1939,
when
he
was
23
years
of
age,
he
went
to
japan
on
an
american
passport.
his
claim
was
that
he
went
there
to
visit
and
study.
he
knew
japanese
apparently
as
an
oral
tongue
but
he
did
not
--
he
could
not
write
japanese
or
read
japanese
because
when
he
got
to
japan,
he
hired
a
tutor
to
teach
him
japanese
characters
so
that
he
could
read
and
write
japanese.
his
father
died
shortly
after
he
got
to
japan
in
november
1939.
he
did
not
then
return
to
the
united
states.
his
claim
at
the
trial
was
that
he
did
not
have
funds
to
come
back
to
the
united
states
though
his
father
had
given
him
the
funds
to
go
to
japan
and
he
did
testify
that
his
father
was
going
to
support
him
during
his
studies
in
japan.
it
--
he
knew
when
he
went
to
japan
in
1939
--
in
august
1939
that
he
was
national
of
japan
as
well
as
the
united
states.
he
was
a
dual
national
and
he
also
knew
that
japan
was
fighting
in
manchuria,
that
there
were
hostilities
going
on
at
that
time.
when
his
father
died
and
he
felt
he
couldn't
continue
with
his
studies
as
he
said,
he
then
went
to
work
in
an
airplane
plant
in
japan
and
this
was
apparently
shortly
after
his
father
died
in
november
1939.
in
june
1940,
he
was
notified
that
he
would
be
inducted
into
the
japanese
army
and
he
came
and
took
a
physical
examination
in
june
1940.
he
was
not
actually
inducted
until
nine
months
later,
march
1941.
now,
during
that
period
of
nine
months
between
june
1940
and
march
1941,
he
himself
testified
that
he
did
not
make
any
protest
or
any
inquiries,
letter
on
protest,
any
protest
or
any
inquiries
of
either
to
the
japanese
authorities
or
of
the
american
authorities.
that
is
the
american
consulate
or
the
american
embassy.
he
did
nothing.
he
did
not
attempt
to
renounce
his
japanese
nationality
as
some
other
persons
and
i
think
i
can
say
this
because
it
--
it
came
up
in
the
record
of
the
kawakita
case
to
which
mr.
okrand
mentioned.
there
were
a
japanese
dual
national
to
renounce
their
japanese
nationality
abroad
in
order
not
to
serve
in
the
japanese
army,
nor
did
he
seek
to
come
back
to
this
country
in
anyway.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
apparently
so.
apparently
that
this
was
--
this
was
rather
early.
this
was
june
1940
to
march
1941.
and
apparently
at
that
time
there
was
a
possibility
of
--
of
abating
service
or
avoiding
service
by
renunciation.
at
least
he
didn't
make
any
effort
to
do
that
or
to
find
out
about
that
nor
did
he
make
any
effort
to
find
out
whether
he
could
come
back
to
the
united
states.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
do
not
know,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
is
my
understanding
of
--
of
the
--
of
the
japanese
law.
i
have
gone
into
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
but
his
--
in
june
1940,
he
was
--
he
went
abroad
in
august
1939.
he
was
notified
of
perhaps
induction
in
june
1940.
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
there
is
no
showing
on
this
record
of
any
attempt
to
find
out
about
these
things.
this
is
all
important
because
the
judge
--
judge
byrne
who,
as
mr.
okrand
has
indicated,
has
heard
a
very
large
number
of
these
japanese
expatriation
cases
in
the
southern
district
of
california
and
has
not
always
many,
many
times
held
in
favor
of
the
--
of
the
citizenship
claimant
against
the
government.
judge
byrne
found
on
the
basis
of
the
record
before
him
and
the
testimony
of
this
petitioner,
who
appeared
orally,
that
this
man
went
to
japan
in
order
to
serve
in
the
japanese
army.
he
made
that
specific
finding
as
one
of
the
basis
of
his
holding.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
he
was
the
only
witness
at
--
at
the
hearing.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
he
based
it
on
the
fact
that
this
was
a
--
a
man
of
a
superior
education
who
testified
at
the
trial
that
he
did
know
--
knew
nothing
at
all
about
the
cold
war
between
japan
and
the
united
states.
he
didn't
know
that
that
war
clouds
were
gathering.
he
didn't
--
he
didn't
read
any
newspapers
abroad.he
didn't
know
what
--
he
didn't
know
that
a
draft
was
occurring
in
the
united
states.
he
said
he
couldn't
read
japanese
characters
or
he
couldn't
read
japanese
newspapers
and
the
one
english
language
newspaper
that
was
published
there,
he
said
was
too
far
out
--
didn't
reached
him
where
he
was
in
the
country
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
you
--
you
have
a
man
who
went
in
august
1939,
who
did
not
return
when
his
father
died
and
even
though
his
father
apparently
was
going
to
support
him
abroad
who
--
and
who
gave
him
the
money
to
go
abroad,
who
took
a
job
in
an
airplane
factory,
who
made
no
protestations,
no
inquiry
whatsoever
in
relation
to
entering
the
japanese
service.
he
didn't
--
he
testified
that
he
didn't
make
any
inquiry
or
protestation
either
as
to
the
--
to
japanese
officials
or
to
the
american
officials.
he
didn't
seek
to
come
back
to
this
country
in
anyway.
he
was
asked
at
the
trial
whether
he
hadn't
heard
that
americans
were
being
asked
at
that
time
to
come
back
to
the
united
states
by
the
consul
there,
he
said
no,
he
hadn't
heard
that.
i
feel
somewhat
justified
in
--
in
contradicting
that
because
in
the
material
which
petitioner
has
filed,
filed
not
in
the
trial
court
but
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
which
it
asked
this
--
this
court
to
take
judicial
notice
of,
petitioner
has
himself
included
two
depositions
of
japanese-americans
in
italy
taken
by
petitioner
not
--
not
in
this
case,
in
other
cases
entirely,
in
other
cases
in
the
southern
district
of
california,
but
in
--
but
depositions
taken
by
the
same
counsel
or
on
behalf
of
the
same
counsel
and
those
are
the
cases.
and
there
is
a
specific
question
in
--
in
one
of
those
depositions,
"did
you
not
know
that
the
american
consulate
was
asking
all
nisei,
all
american
person,
citizens
of
japanese
dissent
to
come
back
to
this
country
in
1940
and
1941?"
"yes,
i
did."
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
this
is
--
this
is
--
these
are
depositions
taken
with
relation
to
other
people
which
are
included
by
this
petitioner
in
matters
which
he
wants
the
court
to
take
judicial
notice
of
and
we
don't
think
he
can
--
you
can
take
judicial
notice
of
them.
but
i
--
i
mentioned
that
because
petitioner
himself
has
--
has
presented
them
to
the
court
for
consideration.
well,
it
was
on
the
basis
of
all
these
facts
and
the
fact
that
he
did
serve
in
the
japanese
army,
that
judge
byrne
held
that
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
he
served
in
--
in
manchuria
and
in
the
philippines
and
in
indonesia.
and
he
testified
that
he
knew
that
there
were
american
troops
in
the
philippines
though
he
said
he
did
not
himself
see
them.
he
was
in
the
air
force.
he
--
he
claimed
he
was
a
mechanic
in
the
--
the
japanese
airforce.
this
is
a
man
with
an
engineering
degree.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
believe
he
served
in
manchuria
before
he
went
to
war
and
then
in
indonesia.
now,
he
did
claim
and
--
and
judge
--
i
think
judge
byrne
disbelieved
him.
he
did
claim
that
there
was
certain
element
of
fear
but
his
statements
as
to
fear
are
very
weak.
he
said
that
he
had
heard
rumors
that
the
kempeitai,
their
political
police
were
surveilling
nisei
and
that
they
would
beat
them
up.
and
he
said
this
might
be
true.
he
didn't
even
say
that
he
--
that
they
were
true.
he
says
this
might
be
true
and
all
he
said
is
that
there
were
rumors.
he
didn't
--
he
said
he
had
personal
contact
with
the
police
at
all
when
he
testified,
that
these
were
rumors
that
he
had
heard.
he
was
asked
if
he
checked
these
rumors
with
any
american
official
in
japan.
he
said
he
did
not.
"did
you
check
those
rumors
with
any
japanese
official
in
japan?"
"no,
sir."
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
may
i
answer
your
question
in
two
parts
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
mr.
justice
black?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
we
think
that
judge
byrne
in
this
case
held
against
petitioner
regardless
of
the
burden
of
proof.
he
does
not
say
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
he
did
not
believe
petitioner's
statements
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
if
he
doesn't
make
any
efforts
to
get
out
of
there.
if
he
doesn't
make
efforts
to
come
back
to
this
country
to
protest,
of
course
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
burden
would
be
on
him
to
do
those
things
and
he
showed
that
he
did
not
do
them.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
i
think
there's
a
difference,
mr.
justice
black,
between
the
burden
of
what
he
must
do
in
order
--
in
relation
to
voluntariness.
as
to
those
things,
there
was
no
question
of
burden
of
proof
because
he
testified
he
did
not
do
those
things.
he
himself
testified
on
direct
and
cross-examination
that
he
did
not
do
any
of
these
things.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
do,
mr.
justice,
and
i
particularly
think
it
was
enough
to
make
--
to
make
a
finding
when
he
went
over
there,
that
he
did
not
go
into
the
japanese
army
under
duress.
but
i
said
i
would
answer
your
question
on
--
in
two
parts
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
and
my
first
answer
is
that
judge
byrne,
regardless
of
the
burden
of
proof,
held
against
the
petitioner
and
we
believe
the
court
of
appeals,
regardless
of
the
burden
of
proof,
affirmed.
though
the
court
of
appeals
did
say
explicitly
that
the
burden
of
proof
was
on
petitioner.
we
think
if
you
read
their
opinion
you
will
see
that
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
then
i'm
going
to
go
on
to
that
--
to
the
second
thing.
as
far
as
burden
of
proof
is
concerned,
if
i
can
make
a
distinction
between
the
ultimate
burden
of
proof,
that
is
if
the
judge
finds
that
the
facts
of
the
evidence
is
equally
balanced,
for
whom
shall
he
decide?
that's
the
ultimate
burden
of
proof.
and
the
burden
of
going
forward
with
the
evidence,
which
party
has
the
--
the
duty
and
obligation
of
initiating
consideration
of
a
certain
matter
and
presenting
some
prima
facie
evidence
in
relation
to
it?
because
we
think
that
there
are
differences
in
relation
to
that.
and
as
i
go
through
the
steps
of
the
--
of
the
trial,
it
may
seem
like
a
tennis
match
in
which
the
balls
are
shifting
backward
and
forward
but
we
think
that's
the
correct
approach.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
we
think
the
kawakita
case
is
quite
different,
mr.
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
more
than
that,
there
were
specific
questions
asked.
there
was
a
special
--
special
verdicts
in
--
in
that
case.
and
the
jury
was
asked,
did
kawakita
ever
think
that
he
had
given
up
his
american
nationality
and
on
the
basis
of
evidence
which
this
court
held
was
sufficient
that
the
jury
returned
a
verdict?
no,
he
never
thought
that
he'd
given
up
his
american
nationality.
and
the
jury
was
also
asked
--
was
also
told
that
if
kawakita
did
anything
--
that
kawakita
had
to
be
found
to
have
done
something
in
order
to
commit
treason
against
the
united
states,
which
was
the
issue
in
that
case,
he
had
to
--
he
found
to
have
done
something
which
was
not
required
of
him
more
than
was
required
of
him
of
--
of
--
by
japanese
law
and
the
jury
made
that
specific
finding.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
expatriation
was
the
threshold
question,
what
you
had
before
us
--
before
you,
findings
of
fact
that
he
had
never
intended
to
expatriate
himself
and
--
and
that
he
--
findings
of
fact
that
no
duress
was
exercised
upon
him.
still
the
petitioner
in
that
case
raised
the
issue
of
expatriation
and
it
was
very
important
question
which
was
mooted
here.
i
--
i
mean
to
lay
the
case
aside
because
there
were
findings
of
fact
in
that
case
made
by
a
jury,
a
special
verdict
which
were
far
different
from
the
cases
--
from
the
case
which
is
before
you
now.
on
the
question
of
burden
of
proof,
the
petitioner
is
the
plaintiff,
as
an
ordinary
plaintiff,
he
has
the
--
what
you
might
say
the
long
range
burden
of
proof
of
showing
that
he's
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
well,
he
proved
that
he
was
born
in
california
and
if
nothing
more
appeared,
that's
all
there
was,
he
would
certainly
be
entitled
to
a
judgment.
the
--
the
burden
would
then
shift
to
the
united
states
and
we
think
that
the
burden
is
clearly
on
the
united
states
of
showing
that
he
committed
an
objective
act
of
expatriation.
that
is
that
he
went
into
the
japanese
armed
forces
while
a
dual
national,
while
a
japanese
of
japan.
but
that
was
proved.
it
was
proved
because
petitioner
himself,
anticipating
what
the
government
could
easily
prove
himself
admitted
that
he
went
into
the
japanese
armed
forces
and
that
he
was
a
national
of
japan.
so
you
have
a
case
where
--
on
the
one
hand
he's
proved
he's
--
he
was
born
in
california,
on
the
other
hand
he's
proved
that
he
served
in
japan
while
a
national
of
japan.
if
nothing
more
appeared,
we
would
think
that
the
--
our
view
is
that
nothing
more
appeared
that
the
government
should
have
--
should
have
the
judgment
because
we
think
that
the
burden,
at
least
the
burden
of
going
forward
with
--
with
showing
issues
of
--
with
showing
matters
of
duress
goes
to
the
petitioner.
he's
the
one
who
knows
that
if
he
entered
the
japanese
army,
he
did
it
under
duress.
and
so
we
say
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
congress
--
well,
the
statute
says
that
--
that
you
are
expatriated,
you
lose
your
nationality
if
you
--
as
a
dual
citizen
entered
the
armed
forces
of
the
other
country.
now
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
the
issue
of
constitutionality
may
be
there
but
the
statute
is
clear
on
--
on
that.
coming
back
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
in
our
view,
yes.
that
congress
is
going
to
pass
the
statute
must
have
known
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
issue
in
the
case
is
whether
it
should
be
construed
that
way.
if
i
could
say
this
on
that
point,
mr.
justice
brennan,
congress
passed
the
statute
in
1940.
it
was
well
known
that
throughout
the
world,
there
was
conscription.
in
fact,
most
of
the
people
who
would
be
caught
by
the
net
of
the
statute
would
be
drafted
or
--
or
conscriptees.
it
was
true
of
all
the
countries,
almost
all
the
countries
which
had
dual
nationality.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
other
--
yes.
the
other
side
argues
that
you
should
nevertheless
construe
the
statute
as
not
relating
to
a
dual
national
who
is
conscripted.
now,
we
admit
that
if
it's
found
that
the
man
though
conscripted
was
--
that
the
man
involuntarily
entered
the
forces,
the
--
the
statute
does
not
apply
then
because
it
has
been
construed
and
we
think
correctly
as
applying
only
to
a
man
who
voluntarily
entered.
our
difference
is
that
we
think
that
mere
proof
of
conscription
alone
does
not
show
involuntariness.
and
that
--
that's
the
issue
which
is
at
--
really
at
the
heart
of
this
case.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
it
would
depend
of
what
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
we
--
mr.
justice
black,
we're
not
saying
that
if
the
man
did
what
he
think
--
we
think
he
should
have
done,
gone
to
the
consulate,
make
protest,
try
to
come
back
to
the
country,
he
couldn't
do
it.
there
are
many
cases
which
the
government
has
not
appealed
and
brought
to
this
court
where
the
man
shows
that
he
went
to
the
consulate.
he
said,
“i
want
--
i
don't
want
to
serve
in
the
army
of
the
foreign
country."
and
they
said,
“there's
nothing
we
can
do
about
it.”
he
said,
“i
want
to
come
back
to
the
united
states.”
they
say,
“we
don't
have
any
funds
to
give
to
you,”
and
so
forth.
he
then
goes
into
the
army
and
we
would
not
be
here
urging
that
he
was
--
that
he
was
--
a
voluntary
entrance
into
the
japanese
army.
we
are
here
urging
this
position
because
this
man
did
none
of
those
things
which
in
all
the
other
cases
those
people
did.
i
don't
mean
they
did
everyone,
but
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
there
is
no
appellate
decision
with
relation
to
duress
and
conscription
which
has
as
bare
a
record
as
this
one.
in
all
the
other
cases
in
which
the
court
has
held
that
a
man
who
was
conscripted
into
the
army
acting
under
duress,
there
was
always
some
showing
of
an
attempt
to
protest
or
--
or
an
attempt
to
inquire
or
an
attempt
to
come
back
to
the
united
states
or
something
rather
like
that.
in
this
case,
there
is
nothing
except
his
protestations
of
fear,
weak
as
they
were
even
stated
and
which
were
disbelieved
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
there
--
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that.
but
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
this
court
held
in
the
savorgnan
case
in
1950
in
--
in
338
u.s.,
that
it
is
not
a
concomitant
of
an
act
of
expatriation
that
the
person
who
commits
it
knows
that
he's
--
has
the
subjective
intent
that
he
expatriate
himself
or
that
he
knows
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
might
have
some
bearing
on
it
but
we
think
it
is
overborne
in
this
case
by
the
--
by
--
by
the
history
--
his
own
history,
the
type
of
person
he
is
and
what
he
did
not
do.
the
judge
so
found
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it's
meaningful,
mr.
justice
brennan,
because
if
the
natural
thing
for
a
person
who's
abroad,
who's
only
going
to
study
and
--
and
visit
as
he
says,
not
to
want
to
serve
in
--
in
the
armed
forces
particularly
at
a
period
of
time
in
which
this
man,
who
was
a
graduate
of
the
university
of
california,
must
have
known
there
was
world
tension
whether
he
knew
there
was
going
to
be
a
war
between
japan
and
united
states
or
not.
and
it's
meaningful
that
in
that
situation,
in
those
circumstances,
he
did
not
do
anything
which
all
the
other
persons
involved
in
this
type
of
case
did
do
or
he
didn't
make
proof
of
--
of
more
direct
terror
and
fears
as
a
result
surveillance
in
japan.
he
said
he
had
no
contact
and
all
of
that.
in
other
words,
our
view
is
that
this
record
is
about
the
barest
record
that
we
have
seen
in
a
long
time
with
relation
to
a
claim
of
--
of
duress
by
a
man
who
was
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh,
he
wasn't
conscripted.
he
--
between
june
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
but
he
--
there
was
a
period
of
time,
june
1940
is
when
he
knew
he
would
be
drafted,
that's
when
he
had
his
physical
examination.he
was
not
actually
inducted
into
the
army
until
nine
months
later
in
march
1941.
what
i'm
talking
about
is
what
he
did
not
do
during
this
nine-month
period.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
--
that's
--
that
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
he
should
have
done
something.
he
did
nothing
and
that's
on
his
own
testimony.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
i
doubt
that,
but
i
think
that
he
--
after
the
examination
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
know.
they
might
have
proceeded
against
him.
we're
not
saying
he
should
have
refused
to
--
to
be
examined.
i'm
not
saying
he
should
have
been
refused
to
be
inducted,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
am
saying
that
he
should
have
done
some
utterly
other
things
which
in
all
the
other
cases
have
been
indicia
indicative
of
a
--
of
a
non-voluntary
--
of
non-voluntary
entrance
into
a
foreign
army.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
he
testified
he
was
not
in
direct
contact
with
the
police.
he
testified
that
he
made
no
effort
to
find
out
anything,
not
only
from
the
japanese
but
from
americans
except
from
some
nisei
friend
of
his
who
gave
him
hearsay
opinion.
he
did
not
go
to
the
consul.
he
was
an
american
citizen
travelling
on
an
--
on
american
passport.
there
would
be
nothing
to
prevent
his
going
up
to
the
american
consulate,
the
american
embassy
and
entering
in
there
for
whatever
business
that
--
that
he
might
have.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
they
wouldn't
--
the
japanese
wouldn't
even
know
why
he
went
to
the
american
embassy.
he
was
travelling
on
an
american
passport.
he
could
go
there
to
renew
the
passport.
they
wouldn't
even
know
why
he
went
there.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
we
hope
not.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
in
other
cases
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
there
are
other
cases
of
niseis.
this
--
i'm
referring
to
reported
cases.
these
are
--
it's
not
in
the
record
in
this
case.
they
were
reported
opinions
which
indicate
that
other
people
did
go
and
did
make
inquiry.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
even
later
than
that,
even
later.
this
is
a
relatively
early
period
in
--
in
relation
to
these
matters.
inquiry
was
made
even
at
a
later
time.
after
all,
pearl
harbor
wasn't
until
--
almost
a
year
after
he
was
inducted
in
the
army.
he
was
inducted
in
march
1941
and
pearl
harbor
didn't
take
place
until
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
i
don't
say
that
--
that
he
should
have
known
we
would
get
--
get
into
the
war.
i
don't
even
think
that
judge
byrne
said
that.
i
--
all
i
say
is
that
he
should
have
known
that
there
was
tension
in
the
world
that
the
japanese
were
fighting,
that
there
was
a
world
situation
which
could
go
up
like
(inaudible).
our
position,
if
i
can
state
it
in
a
minute
that
i
have
today,
is
that
he
has
the
burden
of
going
forward
of
showing
duress
and
that
by
proving
conscription
alone
which
is
all
that
he
proved
here
because
the
judge
did
not
believe
his
other
statement,
by
proving
conscription
alone,
he
does
not
carry
the
burden
of
--
of
making
a
prima
facie
case
of
duress.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
six
minutes
that
i
have
remaining,
it
perhaps
will
be
most
helpful
if
i
present
in
summary
fashion
the
general
position
of
the
government
on
the
issues
of
burden
of
proof
and
burden
of
going
forward
with
the
evidence
of
duress
which
arise
in
these
cases
of
loss
of
nationality.
this
is
an
issue
which
is
present
in
the
much
power
of
the
greatest
majority
of
these
cases
and
which,
at
least,
in
certain
aspects,
there
is
a
conflict
of
the
circuits.
once
the
government
has
proved
as
it
must
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
an
objective
act
of
expatriation
has
been
committed
such
as
the
joining
by
this
petitioner
of
the
army
of
japan.
then
the
question
is,
what
about
involuntariness
or
what
about
duress?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
involuntariness
and
duress.
now
all
the
courts
of
appeals
are
agreed,
all
of
them
agreed
that
the
burden
of
initiating
consideration
of
that
subject
lies
on
the
claimant
to
citizenship.
that
is,
he
must
bring
up
the
issue
of
duress.
he
must
make
some
kind
of
showing
in
order
to
throw
that
issue
into
the
case.
all
the
courts
of
appeals,
as
we
read
their
opinion
are
agreed
on
that.
now
the
next
question
is
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
he
joined
the
--
entered
the
army
of
--
of
foreign
country
while
in
national
thereof.
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
doesn't
use
the
word
"voluntary"
mr.
chief
justice.
that
is
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
says
entering
or
serving
in
the
armed
forces
of
a
foreign
state,
unless
expressly
authorize
by
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
in
fact,
as
i
would
try
to
point
out
in
a
moment,
the
congress
deliberately
omitted
the
word
“voluntary”
when
the
statute
was
under
consideration
in
1940.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
then
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
is
our
--
our
position.
now,
if
the
burden
of
coming
forward
of
--
with
some
proof,
some
prima
facie
evidence
of
duress
rest
on
the
claimant
to
citizenship,
what
is
enough
is
the
fact
that
he
was
drafted,
that
he
was
conscripted,
is
that
enough?
now
on
that
issue,
there
is
a
conflict
of
circuits.
the
court
below
and
we
believe
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
and
perhaps
some
others
have
said
that
mere
proof
of
subscription
of
conscription
is
not
enough
to
carry
his
burden
of
coming
forward.
as
we
read
the
second
and
third
circuits
decisions,
they
have
said
it
is
enough.
on
that
issue,
all
i
would
like
to
add
to
what
has
been
said
is
to
point
out
that
this
court
in
the
two
cases,
the
murata
and
okimura
case,
which
it
had
here
about
four
or
five
years
ago,
we
think
we
solved
that
issue.
in
those
two
cases,
judge
mclaughlin
in
hawaii
had
invalidated
the
statutes
providing
for
expatriation
for
serving
on
a
foreign
army
and
the
japanese
army
in
that
case.
the
cases
came
here
on
that
constitutional
issue.
the
court
did
not
decide
the
constitutional
issue.
it
vacated
the
–-
of
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
remanded
the
case,
both
cases
for
consideration
by
the
trial
court
of
the
issue
of
duress
pointing
out
that
all
the
circumstances
should
be
shown
and
inferences
draw
therefrom.
the
point
i
wish
to
make
here
is
that
if
conscription
alone
were
enough,
the
court
would
have
affirmed
the
judgment
below
because
on
the
records
which
came
to
this
court,
it
was
undisputed
that
both
of
those
petitioners
had
been
conscripted,
had
been
grafted
into
the
japanese
army.
this
was
clear
on
the
findings
of
fact
made
by
the
trial
judge.
and
if
that
was
enough
to
bear
his
burden
of
coming
forward,
there
would
have
been
no
need
to
reverse
the
cases
and
send
it
back
for
further
hearings
and
further
consideration
on
the
issue
of
duress.
now,
i
pass
from
the
issue
of
--
of
who
--
of
whether
duress
is
sufficient.
i
mean,
if
whether
conscription
is
sufficient
to
--
for
the
citizenship
claimant
to
show
in
order
to
bear
his
burden
of
coming
forward
with
evidence
of
duress.
and
i
pass
to
the
--
that
the
last
question
of
who
has
the
ultimate
burden
of
proof
in
the
whole
case,
and
perhaps
i
can
state
it
most
succinctly
if
i
say
that
petitioner's
view
of
the
statute
is
as
if
it
read,
a
person
shall
lose
his
nationality
by
entering
or
serving
in
the
armed
forces
of
a
foreign
state
voluntarily
--
voluntarily
as
if
that
word
were
in
the
statute
as
part
of
the
--
the
facts
which
cause
the
expatriation.
on
the
other
hand,
our
position
is
that
it's
a
proviso
that
its
as
if
congress
had
said,
“you
lose
your
nationality
by
entering
or
serving
in
the
armed
forces
of
a
foreign
state
provided
that
if
you
can
show
that
you
did
it
involuntarily,
you
shall
not
lose
your
nationality.”
i
argue
with
the
statute,
the
citizenship
claimant
would
have
the
burden
of
proof
that
--
that
he
did
enter
under
duress.
now,
as
a
general
rule,
duress
is
a
defense
in
our
law.
it
is
not
part
of
the
plaintiff's
case.
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
states
specifically
that
in
civil
actions,
duress
must
be
set
up
and
prove
by
the
defendant.
we
think
that
that
general
rule
which
occurs
in
many
cases,
in
fact
occurs
in
the
type
of
cases
from
which
this
court
took
the
clear
and
convincing
rule,
the
--
the
patent
--
land
patent
cases
where
the
court
said
the
defenses
of
--
of
bona
fide
of
purchase
over
value
had
to
be
set
up
and
proved
by
the
man
who
had
the
land
patent.
since
my
time
has
expired,
all
i
can
do
is
refer
the
court
to
the
--
to
the
discussion
in
our
brief
of
the
legislative
history
which
we
think
is
very
important
and
which
shows
that
congress
deliberately
rejected
the
notion
that
voluntariness
should
be
proved
by
the
government.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
like
mr.
wirin,
i
intend
to
devote
myself
unless
the
court
desires
to
hear
argument
on
the
question
of
constitutionality,
solely
to
the
issue
of
the
burden
of
proof
of
duress
and
the
quantum
of
proof
of
duress.
what
is
sufficient
proof
of
duress
in
a
case
such
as
nishikawa's?
and
let's
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
mr.
justice,
sir.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
no.
on
--
in
the
basis
of
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
the
issue,
the
--
the
general
issue
of
who
has
the
burden
of
proof
and
the
general
issue
of
what
is
the
quantum
of
burden
of
proof
is
important
not
only
in
this
particular
case
but
it
arises
very
frequently
in
expatriation
cases
both
under
the
1940
act
and
under
the
later
act
of
1952.
so
it
is
a
general
problem
which
is
troubling
courts
in
this
field.
if
i
may
state
summarily
first
what
the
government's
position
is
and
then
try
to
elaborate
it,
i
think
it
may
be
helpful.
and
i
would
like
to
stress
at
the
outset
that
when
i
state
what
the
government's
position
is,
i
am
basing
that
position
on
three
sources.
one
source,
a
very
important
source
is
the
legislative
history
of
the
1940
act
which
we
believe
bears
out
our
view
of
the
burden
of
proof,
where
the
burden
of
proof
is
and
the
quantum
of
proof.
the
second
source
is
prior
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
particular
appeal
to
the
expatriation.
and
the
third
source
is
analogous
in
comparable
provisions
in
other
fields
of
loss.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
statute
itself
--
except
the
words
of
the
statute
shed
no
light.
the
word
voluntarily
does
not
appear
in
the
statute.
the
light
is
shed
by
the
legislative
history
and
by
the
--
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
lower
court.
summarily,
what
our
position
is,
is
this.
the
citizen
claimant
has
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
act
of
expatriation
which
he
committed,
an
act
which
the
government
must
prove,
but
he
has
the
burden
of
proving
that
that
act
of
expatriation
was
done
involuntarily
in
order
to
excuse
himself
from
the
effects
of
that
act.
that's
the
first
proposition.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
the
citizen
claimant,
i
call
him.
yes.
the
second
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
he
join
the
foreign
army
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
the
government
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
i
--
i
would
say
this
that
in
certain
acts
of
expatriation,
there
is
a
subjective
element
such
as
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
--
that's
right.
the
second
proposition
is
that
the
citizen
claimant,
petitioner
here,
nishikawa,
does
not
fulfill
his
burden
of
proof
by
proving
that
he
was
conscripted
that
is
--
that
is
not
sufficient.
that
if
all
he
proves
is
that
he
was
conscripted,
that
is
not
sufficient,
the
case
goes
against
him
and
in
favor
of
the
government.
my
third
proposition
is,
in
relation
to
this
particular
case
that
all
that
nishikawa
has
proved
as
the
case
comes
to
this
court
after
a
trial
before
district
court
and
findings
by
the
district
court
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
as
the
case
comes
before
this
court,
all
that
nishikawa
has
proved
is
that
he
was
drafted
into
the
japanese
army
in
1941.
and
if
i'm
right
on
the
first
two
propositions,
he
cannot
make
a
case
by
proving
that
he
was
conscripted.
i
would
stress
now
before
i
go
in
--
when
i
go
into
the
--
there
--
there's
a
fourth
proposition
which
we
also
stand
on
in
which
i
probably
won't
have
much
time
to
go
into
but
which
is
expressed
in
our
brief.
that
in
this
particular
case,
regardless
of
where
the
burden
of
proof
is
and
regardless
of
what
the
quantum
of
proof
is,
the
trial
judge
found
irrespective
of
the
burden
of
proof
that
nishikawa's
entry
into
the
japanese
armed
forces
was
voluntary.
so
that
in
this
particular
case,
if
the
court
wish,
we
believe
that
it
could
pretermit
the
issues
of
burden
of
proof.
it
could
find
that
even
if
the
government
had
the
burden
of
proof,
that
burden
of
proof
was
satisfied.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
mr.
justice.
our
position
is
that
even
if
whatever
--
whoever
has
the
burden
of
proof,
if
you
just
look
at
nishikawa's
own
testimony
which
is
all
that
there
is
in
this
case,
it
is
sufficient
to
find
that
his
entry
into
the
--
into
the
japanese
armed
forces
was
voluntary.
let
me
go
if
i
can
to
the
--
the
facts
in
this
--
in
this
particular
case.
but
before
i
do,
i
would
like
to
stress
the
fact
because
i
think
that
mr.
wirin
did
not
emphasize
it
for
reasons
which
are
clear
from
his
point
of
view
that
the
trial
judge
did
not
believe
nishikawa's
testimony
that
he
was
frightened.
he
did
not
believe
his
testimony
that
he
stayed
--
that
he
refused
to
do
anything
to
keep
himself
out
of
the
japanese
army
because
he
was
afraid
of
the
secret
police
or
afraid
of
anything
else.
now,
this
was
a
man
who
appeared
before
the
trial
judge.
he
was
a
witness
on
the
stand.
and
the
trial
judge
said
explicitly,
"i
do
not
believe
his
claim
that
he
didn't
--
that
--
of
--
of
tariff.
and
whatever
may
be
the
power
of
a
court,
of
appellate
court
to
review
findings
of
fact
by
a
trial
judge
in
an
expatriation
case,
certainly,
the
--
the
credibility
of
the
witness
is
still
within
--
in
the
hands
of
the
district
court.
this
court
said
that
in
a
denaturalization
case,
the
(inaudible)
case.
they
said
that
credibility
still
remains
with
the
district
judge.
and
so,
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
state
the
facts
in
this
case
in
that
light.
the
facts,
most
of
which
i
shall
state
first,
are
undisputed,
was
that
he
--
he
was
born
in
the
united
states
in
california,
went
to
the
public
schools
here,
went
to
the
university
of
california,
got
an
engineering
degree
and
graduated.
in
1939
--
in
august
1939,
he
went
abroad
to
japan
at
the
instance
of
his
father,
paid
for
by
his
father
for
the
purpose
of
studying
in
japan
for
a
period
of
two
to
five
years.
he
did
not
know
japanese
written
characters.
he
hardly
knew
japanese
is
a
spoken
language.
he
did
not
know
written
japanese.
when
he
got
over
there,
he
hired
a
tutor
for
the
purpose
of
studying
written
japanese.
shortly
after
he
got
over
there,
he
apparently
got
there
let's
say
in
august
1939.
in
november
1939,
his
father
died
and
his
testimony
was
that
he
then
was
cut
off
from
--
from
income
from
the
united
states
and
he
had
to
take
a
job
which
he
did.
he
took
a
job
in
an
airplane
plant
which
he
kept
until
he
was
inducted
into
the
japanese
army.
now,
the
district
judge
also
made
a
very
specific
finding
of
fact
and
these
findings
of
fact
that
when
nishikawa
left
the
united
states
in
august
1939
to
go
to
japan,
he
knew
that
japan
was
at
war
or
had
hostilities
in
manchuria
and
that
he
knew
he
was
liable
to
be
drafted
in
the
japanese
army,
that
he
knew
he
was
a
japanese
citizen
as
well
as
an
american
citizen,
that
he
had
dual
nationality
as
mr.
wirin
is
said.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
he
based
it
on
nishikawa's
own
statement
that
he
knew
he
had
japanese
citizen
--
citizenship.
now,
that
statement
in
the
colloquy
in
the
--
in
the
record,
the
examination
is
this
--
“when
you
went
into
the
japanese
army
did
you
know
you
were
a
--
an
american
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
presumably,
the
judge
knew
--
used
the
fact
that
this
was
an
intelligent
man.
that
he
went
to
--
that
he
went
to
japan
for
some
reason.
that
he
--
that
he's
testified
that
he
knew
he
had
japanese
citizenship
when
he
got
--
went
into
the
japanese
army.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
isn't
qualified
to
say
that
i
didn't
know
it
before.
the
question
was
when
he
went
into
the
--
“when
you
went
into
the
japanese
army,
did
you
know
that
you
have
japanese
citizenship?”
he
answered,
“yes,
i
knew
i
had
been
registered.”
now,
that
doesn't
exclude
the
fact
that
he
knew
it
before
he
went
into
the
japanese
army.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
that
the
evidence
is
--
what
i've
said
mr.
justice
that
a
trial
court
can
properly
and
did
properly
base
that
finding
on
--
on
the
knowledge
of
the
man's
intelligence,
the
fact
that
he
went
to
japan
which
people
don't
ordinarily
do
unless
to
study
japanese
language
and
literature,
unless
they
have
some
connection
with
japan
that
he
knew
that
japan
was
fighting
in
manchuria
and
that
he
knew
that
he
was
--
by
the
time
he
went
into
the
japanese
army,
he
knew
he
was
a
japanese
citizen.
i
think
that's
sufficient
finding
that
he
knew
when
he
went
abroad
that
he
was
a
japanese
citizen
and
dual
national.
that
is
--
and
that
is
the
trial
judge's
finding.
now,
in
june
of
1940
which
is
a
little
less
than
a
year
after
he
got
to
japan,
he
was
notified
that
he
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it's
a
general
question
which
perhaps,
unfortunately,
the
u.s.
attorney
prefaced
by
saying,
“when
you
went
into
the
japanese
army,”
but
the
answer
is
a
general
answer,
it's
on
page
34
of
the
record,
at
the
bottom
of
the
record.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
“now,
at
the
time
that
you
entered
the
japanese
army,
mr.
nishikawa,
you
were
a
national
japan,
is
that
correct?”
answer,
“yes.
i
was
a
national
of
japan
because
my
father
registered
at
the
time
of
my
birth
in
the
family
register.”
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
and
--
and
that
plus
the
other
elements.
plus
he's
going
to
japan,
his
intelligence,
all
these
other
things
was
the
foundation
for
the
judge's
finding
that
he
knew
when
he
went
to
japan
that
he
was
a
japanese
national
and
subject
to
the
draft.
now,
in
june,
1940
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
same
evidence
plus
the
fact
that
it
was
common
knowledge
that
japan
was
engaged
in
hostilities
in
manchuria
and
that
japan,
like
many
other
nations
of
the
world
had
conscription.
i
think
the
judge
was
entitled
to
and
did
take
into
account
that
common
knowledge
which
he
would
assume
that
a
nisei
who
went
to
japan
would
know
about.
there's
also
evidence
that
he
made
no
attempt
to
check
whether
he
was
subject
to
--
to
the
draft
or
not
and
that
also
entered
into
the
court's
finding.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
he
was
--
yes,
he
asked
and
he
denied
it.
but
again,
that's
an
issue
of
credibility.
the
judge
said,
“i
do
not
believe.”
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
and
we
think
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
we
--
we
think
taking
everything
into
account,
what
i've
said
plus
the
demeanor
of
the
witness
and
so
forth,
there
was
sufficient
evidence.
there
would
be
a
sufficient
evidence
for
a
jury
to
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
he
knew
of
this
fact
when
he
went
to
japan.
now,
in
june
1940
he
had
a
physical
examination
which
he
took.
he
was
not
inducted
into
the
army
until
nine
months
later
in
march,
1941.
now,
there's
a
period
of
nine
months.
now,
during
that
period
of
nine
months,
there
is
no
doubt
because
he
admitted
it
that
he
did
not
take
any
of
the
following
steps.
he
did
not
find
out
from
any
american
official
of
the
consulate,
what
to
do,
whether
he
was
subject
to
the
draft
or
whether
there's
anything
he
could
do.
he
did
not
ask
any
japanese
official
whether
he
was
subject
to
the
draft
or
whether
he
could
get
out
because
he
was
an
american
official.
he
did
not
seek
to
renounce
his
japanese
nationality
which
others
had
done.
perhaps,
it
was
a
difficult
thing
but
he
did
not
seek
to
--
to
do
it
or
to
find
out
whether
he
could
have
done
it.
he
did
not
seek
to
find
out
whether
he
could
return
to
the
united
states,
whether
he
will
be
given
money
by
the
americans
or
--
or
some
other
way.
i'm
not
saying
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
between
june,
1940
and
march
1941.
he
was
inducted
in
march
1941.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
i
think
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
if
you
will
take
the
great
mass
of
cases,
you
will
find
and
we
have
tried
to
set
out
in
our
supplemental
brief
all
the
appellate
cases
on
this
subject.
you
will
find
out
that
some
efforts
are
made.
the
--
and
--
and
as
i'll
try
to
get
to
later,
congress
expected
some
efforts
will
be
made.
they
might
not
be
successful.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
others
made
--
made
the
attempt.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
i
should
say
right
now
because
the
--
the
other
side's
latest
brief
seems
to
think
that
we
take
the
position
that
the
man
had
to,
shall
i
say,
scream
from
housetop,
no.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
the
whole
proposition
is
that
congress
said,
“you've
got
to
show
some
resistance
to
going
into
the
japanese
army.”
in
order
to
show
--
lack
of
duress,
you've
got
to
show
that
you
try
to
keep
out
in
some
way.
we
don't
expect
you
to
be
a
hero
or
a
model
but
we
have
to
show
--
we
have
to
see
something
which
indicates
that
you
--
you
didn't
want
to
go
in.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
--
i
have
difficulty
with
the
problem
of
judicial
notice
because
a
large
opportunity
was
granted
to
experienced
counsel.
mr.
wirin
is
probably
the
most
experienced
counsel
in
this
field,
in
this
firm,
to
present
evidence
in
the
district
court
which
could
have
been
qualified
by
the
government
or
controverted.
this
was
not
done.
it
has
been
done
in
other
cases,
it
was
not
done
here.
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
we
think
not
because
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
we
think
not
because
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
in
each
case
--
in
each
case,
the
government
may
have
--
we
had
no
opportunity
to
bring
other
things
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
in
here
which
we
didn't
do.
what
--
what
is
brought
in
other
case
has
brought
a
conglomeration
of
other
cases
not
--
and
we
had
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
mr.
justice.
i
think
you
can
assume
that
the
japanese
ordinarily
force
people
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
but
i
do
not
think
you
can
assume
that
other
people
--
other
dual
nationals
in
his
situation
did
not
make
efforts
to
get
out
or
to
stay
away
or
to
get
protection
or
come
back
to
the
united
states
or
to
renounce
their
japanese
nationality.
that
i
think
you
cannot
assume
on
the
basis
of
judicial
notice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
probably
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
the
point
that
congress
was
interested
in
--
the
point
that
congress
was
interested
in
is
seeing
whether
he
made
the
effort.
it
might
be
that
he
would
have
to
go
into
the
--
in
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
because
they
were
trying
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
they
will
try
this
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
they
were
trying
to
separate
the
sheep
from
the
goats.
they
were
trying
to
separate
those
who
really
made
the
effort
--
made
what
effort
they
could
in
a
particular
circumstances
and
--
from
those
who
--
who
did
--
who
didn't
indicate
an
attachment
to
the
united
states.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
that
--
that
--
and
if
perhaps
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
accept
the
last
statement
you
made
that
it
would
put
him
in
difficulty.
other
people
did
or
--
and
some
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
i
can't
say
they
didn't.
i
--
i
don't
know
but
other
people
did.
there
are
--
and
other
people
did
leave
before
they
were
perhaps
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
he
did
not.
he
said
he
did
not.
he
excused
it.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
he
said
he
was
afraid
that
the
japanese
police
would
get
after
him
and
the
judge
disbelieved
those
statements.
i
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh,
yes.
but
he
didn't
say
that
the
only
reason
he
gave
for
not
trying
to
find
out
about
whether
he
was
going
to
be
drafted
or
not
drafted
or
according
to
the
american
consulate
was
the
fact
that
he
was
afraid
that
there
were
rumors,
he
said,
which
might
have
been
true.
he
was
never
himself
personally
contacted
by
any
japanese
police
officer,
he
said
that.
he
was
never
--
he
never
personally
came
in
contact
with
any
japanese
police
officer.
he
had
no
personal
experience
which
would
have
led
him
to
believe
that
anything
bad
would
have
--
would
have
happened
to
him.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
mr.
justice.
i
don't
think
it
had
to
because
on
the
basis
of
--
of
his
own
testimony
and
the
way
he
put
it
and
the
demeanor
evidence
which
the
judge
had,
the
judge
was
--
could
disbelieve
the
statement.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
he
said
that
he
talked
under
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
no
evidence
was
offered
by
the
government.
that
conversation
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
pardon
me?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
there
were
things
--
they
couldn't
keep
him
out
of
the
japanese
army
but
there
were
things
that
could've
been
done.
people
did
return
to
this
country
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
between
the
time
of
summonsing
and
the
time
of
induction.perhaps
it
was
illegal
under
--
under
japanese
law,
i
don't
know
but
it
was
done.
and
so
that
--
and
even
before
he
was
--
after
all,
he'd
--
he
--
he
didn't
--
he
only
received
the
notice
--
excuse
me.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
the
records
are
not
in
this
--
in
this
case.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
in
view
of
your
question,
mr.
justice,
i
feel
justified
in
calling
account
of
material
which
the
petitioner's
counsel
has
filed
in
this
court.
this
was
not
introduced
at
the
trial
court.
it
was
material
from
other
cases
which
was
introduced
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
which
has
been
filed
in
this
court.
we
do
not
think
it
is
properly
part
of
the
--
of
the
record
but
i
did
go
over
it.
and
then
one
of
the
depositions
in
--
in
the
cases
filed
by
mr.
wirin
here
in
another
case
--
in
another
case.
the
question,
"you
knew
prior
to
the
war
for
about
a
year
that
the
consulate
was
advising
all
american
citizens
to
leave
japan,
didn't
you?"
"yes,
i
did."
"isn't
it
true
that
there
were
in
addition
--
that
there
were
in
addition
to
official
statements
by
the
state
department
that
among
the
japanese
people,
the
nisei,
there
were
rumors
and
general
talk
about
the
fact
that
american
citizens
should
leave
japan."
"yes."
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
it
was.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
june
1940.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
would
necessarily
conflict
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
but
he
--
he
wasn't
inducted
until
march
1941.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
he
was
given
a
physical
examination.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
know
whether
that
--
i
don't
know
and
the
record
doesn't
show
whether
that's
ordering
up
and
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
know.
the
only
law
of
japan
that
appears
in
the
record
doesn't
say
it.
and
anybody
who
doesn't
come
into
the
barracks
when
ordered,
it
violates
the
law
of
japan.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
under
our
law,
it
is
an
offense.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
is,
i
--
i
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
in
our
view,
yes.
[laughter]
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
because
we
think
it's
very
important
to
point
out,
one,
that
this
court,
we
believe,
has
already
held
in
1953
in
the
okimura
and
murata
cases
in
342
united
states.
that
conscription
alone
is
not
sufficient
because
there,
the
court
sent
it
back
though
there
was
undisputed
proof
of
this
conscription
of
two
japanese
who
entered
the
japanese
army.
there
was
an
undisputed
proof.
the
court
sent
it
back
for
findings
and
investigation
as
to
the
other
elements.
so
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
i
think
the
court
said.
and
if
i
can,
i'd
like
to
get
to
the
legislative
history
because
we
haven't
set
it
out
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
the
murata
and
okimura
case,
342
--
it's
acheson
against
murata
and
acheson
against
okimura,
per
curiam
decisions
of
the
court.
the
legislative
history
is
stronger
than
we
set
it
out
in
our
brief
as
i
had
occasion
to
find
out
when
i
was
preparing
for
oral
argument.
the
reason
it
is
stronger
is
that
there
were
--
there
were
proof,
we
believe,
of
two
factors.
one
factor
is
that
--
that
the
congress
did
not
believe
that
conscription
alone
would
be
enough
proof
of
duress.
and
the
second
factor
is
that
congress
thought
that
the
burden
of
proof
of
duress
should
be
on
the
citizen
claimant.
those
two
elements
of
our
--
of
our
case.
now,
what
about
conscription?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
particular
citations
are
not
in
the
brief.
the
--
there's
a
general
reference
to
the
legislative
history.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
pardon
me?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
there
in
the
brief,
at
page
30.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
quotations,
but
what
i'm
about
to
give
the
court
are
not
in
the
brief.
the
quotations
are
somewhat
strike
--
the
pages
are
given
in
--
in
the
court
--
in
the
brief.
now,
when
this
particular
provision
of
the
statute
was
before
the
committee
and
the
representatives
of
the
various
departments
were
there,
and
i
should
say
that
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
1940
act,
one
very
important
element
of
--
one
very
important
source
of
legislative
history
are
the
hearings
because
the
--
the
bill
had
been
drafted
by
the
cabinet
committee
which
the
solicitor
general
spoke
in
the
last
case.
and
the
representatives
of
the
state
department
or
the
labor
department
and
the
justice
department
are
right
there
and
with
the
committee
on
immigration
and
naturalization.
and
when
the
bill
did
get
to
the
houses
of
congress,
there
are
constant
references
to
the
help
of
the
--
of
the
officials
of
the
three
departments
and
so
it's
fair
to
go
back
to
the
hearings
to
see
what
occurred
there
as
part
of
the
important
legislative
history
of
the
act.
now,
when
this
particular
provision,
joining
a
foreign
army
came
before
the
committee,
the
state
department,
through
its
representative,
mr.
flournoy,
the
assistant
legal
advisor,
wanted
to
make
it
conclusive
of
--
that
a
man
who
joined
the
foreign
army
of
which
he
was
also
a
citizen,
couldn't
show
duress
at
all.
and
he
said,
they're
always
trying
to
show
duress,
he
said.
and
they're
always
trying
to
show
--
we
ought
to
make
it
conclusive
that
if
he
joins
the
army
of
another
country
of
which
he
is
a
citizen,
he
is
automatically
expatriated
whether
he
did
it
voluntarily
or
involuntarily,
and
the
war
department
supported
that
position.
now,
the
labor
department
and
the
justice
department
opposed
and
the
grounds
of
their
opposition
are
very
important
to
my
argument
because
their
grounds
were,
"we
ought
to
let
him
have
an
opportunity
to
come
in
and
show
that
though
he
was
drafted,
although
he
entered
the
army,
he
did
what
he
could
to
stay
out."
they
put
it
always
in
terms
of
give
him
the
opportunity
to
show.
i
think
he
ought
to
have
the
chance
to
show
which
is
as
clear
an
indication
of
where
the
burden
proof
could
lie
in
the
terms
in
which
congress
was
considering
as
there
could
be.
the
labor
department
and
this
--
and
the
justice
department
succeeded
in
their
view,
congress
did
not
adopt
the
--
the
view
of
mr.
flournoy.
but
we
think
you
must
take
together
with
that
action
of
congress
the
legislative
background
which
is
he
ought
to
have
the
opportunity
to
show.
he
ought
to
be
--
have
a
chance
to
show
the
burden
is
on
him.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
would
be
invalid,
mr.
justice,
under
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
but
this
is
not
a
criminal
offense.
this
is
an
entirely
different
kind
of
statute
and
--
and
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
it
--
it
may
raise
a
question
but
we
think
that
in
the
light
of
the
previous
decisions
of
this
court
which
were
cited
in
our
brief,
there
is
no
constitutional
objection
to
what
--
doing
what
congress
did.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
it
goes
to
the
interpretation
of
--
of
subsection
(c)
that
congress
intended
when
it
enacted
subsection
(c)
that
the
government
proved
the
act
of
expatriation
but
that
the
citizen
claimant
has
the
burden
of
proof
of
showing
that
he
performed
the
act
under
duress.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
that
--
that's
right.
i
think
since
the
statute
is
--
is
neutralized
faith.
it's
appropriate
to
go
back
to
the
legislative
history
to
see
what
congress
had
in
mind
and
that
is
what
i've
been
trying
to
present
to
the
court.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
because
that
it
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
ultimately,
it's
a
question
of
interpreting
the
statute
and
congress
can
do
it
explicitly
or
it
can
do
it
implicitly.
for
instance,
in
this
case,
congress
deliberately
did
not
put
the
word
voluntarily
under
section
401
(c)
which
was
suggested
to
it.
he
did
not
put
it
in
there.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right,
mr.
justice.
the
1952
act
does
have
a
provision
just
to
the
kind
you
said
and
that
is
now
of
course
here
before
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
not
before
the
court.
then
with
relation
to
conscription,
it
seems
relatively
clear
from
the
hearings
of
--
of
the
committee
and
from
some
of
the
statements
on
the
floor
of
the
house
that
congress
knew
that
men
would
be
conscripted
into
foreign
armies
and
that
they
did
not
think
that
fact
alone
would
be
enough
of
an
excuse.
again,
there
was
quite
a
discussion
between
the
various
people
of
the
committee.
and
the
representatives
of
the
labor
department
who
were
the
foremost
ones
in
saying,
"give
the
man
a
chance
to
prove
that
he
--
that
he
did
what
he
could,"
were
also
the
ones
who
said,
"of
course,
if
he
puts
his
head
into
the
lion's
mouth
then
he
should
be
expatriated."
if
he
has
gone
there
knowing
this
will
happen
to
him,
that
is
he
will
be
drafted,
then
he
should
be
expatriated.
assume
that
war
breaks
out
and
he
is
drafted,
i
would
certainly
let
him
make
a
showing
that
that
was
against
--
against
his
will
and
that
he
intended
to
keep
his
american
citizenship
a
lie.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
these
are
individual
members
--
representatives
of
--
of
the
state
and
labor
department.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
there
is
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
two.
both
--
both
things
occurred.
one,
both
the
sponsor
--
the
sponsor
in
both
houses,
were
representative
swellenback,
congressman
rees
and
congressman
dickstein
referred
consistently
to
this
committee
at
which
the
representatives
of
the
various
departments
had
appeared.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
dickstein
was
chairman
of
the
committee
and
congressman
rees
of
kansas
was
the
ranking
member
who
had
a
great
do
--
deal
to
do
in
the
drafting
of
legislation.
so
they
referred
constantly
and
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
can't
say
that
they
said
we
adopt
everything
they
had
said
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
but
they,
in
essence,
adopted
the
general
view
of
these
things
that
i've
been
saying
to
you.
and
also,
there
is
one
slight
reference
on
the
floor
of
the
house,
two
slight
references
which
are
significant
and
that
is
in
colloquy,
congressman
reiss
who
was
one
of
the
leading
sponsors
of
the
bill,
referred
twice
to
men
called
back
to
serve
in
the
army
of
the
other
country.
now,
the
only
time
you're
called
back
is
when
you
--
when
you're
conscripted
or
drafted.
and
so
that
is
an
indication
on
the
floor
of
the
house.
and
mr.
justice
harlan,
we
do
not
have
these
citations
in
our
brief,
so
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
give
them
to
you.
appear
at
86
congressional
record
--
86
congressional
record
13248
and
13250.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.my
argument
is
that
that
fact
alone
shall
not
show
that
he
went
in
involuntarily.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
he
can
--
he
must
then
go
further
and
show
other
things
which
bear
upon
the
issue
of
voluntariness.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
we
think
that
there
is
a
very
rational
connection
between
--
for
--
the
rational
reason
for
congress
to
impose
the
burden
of
proof
of
such
a
personal
thing
as
voluntariness
and
conduct
upon
the
individual
rather
than
upon
the
government.
and
so
we
think
there
is
no
violation
of
the
tot
case
which
dealt
only
with
an
irrational
presumption
which
had
no
relevance
to
--
to
who
knows
best
of
what
the
situation
is
or
rational
inference
from
other
facts.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
might
have
the
indulgence
of
the
court
to
say
one
further
thing
because
it
is
not
in
our
brief.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
at
the
--
one
reason
why
congress
adopted
the
rule
that
we
have
believed
that
they
did
adopt
is
that
at
the
very
same
time
and
this
is
referred
to
in
the
house
debate.
at
the
very
same
time,
they
adopted
in
a
very
easy
short
form,
renaturalization
proceeding
for
people
who
had
expatriated
themselves
by
serving
in
a
foreign
army.
that's
section
317
(c)
of
the
1940
act
which
is
not
in
our
brief,
317
(c).
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
in
the
same
act.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
in
the
same
act.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
and
that's
right,
it's
--
and
it
was
referred
to
constantly
on
the
floor
of
the
house
when
people
said
how
harsh
this
is.
you're
saying
that
a
man
who
goes
abroad
and
serves
in
the
foreign
army
gets
expatriated.
the
answer
was,
"well,
maybe
so
but
he
can
come
back
easily."
now,
of
course,
he
must
meet
the
ordinary
provisions
of
the
--
of
exclusion
of
the
immigration
law,
provided
that
he
could
come
back
without
(inaudible)
that
he
had
to
meet
the
ordinary
provisions
for
good
character
and
so
forth
of
the
immigration
law.
and
i
should
say,
i
don't
know
the
reason
why
it
wasn't
done
that
--
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
could
have
availed
himself
of
that
provision
until
it
was
repealed
in
december
1952.
he
did
--
he
didn't
do
it
and
perhaps
his
counsel
or
some
other
person
didn't
know
about
it
but
it
was
available
to
him
until
it
was
repealed
by
the
new
act
of
1952.
mr.

the
history
is
that
judge
maclaughlin
in
hawaii
made
more
extensive
findings
of
--
of
--
subsidiary
findings
which
the
government
believed
proved
duress.
but
judge
maclaughlin
then
refused
to
find
duress
as
an
ultimate
fact
and
held
the
statute
unconstitutional
again.
we
did
not
seek
to
appeal
the
case
for
the
reason
that
the
subsidiary
findings
of
duress
which
judge
maclaughlin
had
made
were
precisely
the
same
kind
of
findings
made
by
district
judges
on
the
west
coast
generally
and
other
district
judges
in
hawaii
which
the
government
has
--
had
accepted
and
which
is
not
appealed
to
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but
there
were
further
findings
than
there
were
in
this
case.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but
further
findings
of
--
subsidiary
findings
of
duress
as
to
what
happened
to
them
than
there
were
