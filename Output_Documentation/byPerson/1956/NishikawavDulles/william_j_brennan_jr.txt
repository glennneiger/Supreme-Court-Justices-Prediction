justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
that
situation
or
in
the
draft
--
anything
in
the
draft
law
would
have
brought
upon
him
some
consequences
if
he
gone
in
the
american
consulate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
was
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
did
the
petitioner
admit
knowledge
that
by
going
into
the
japanese
army
he
was
risking
a
loss
of
his
american
citizenship?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
in
that
circumstance,
what
reason
would
he
have
had
to
go
to
the
american
consulate
if
he
didn't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
how
does
--
how
does
disbelief
of
all
of
that
add
up
to
the
affirmative
finding
that
he
went
there
purposely
to
join
the
japanese
army.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it's
this
petition?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
--
and
there
includes,
i
take
it,
drafted?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
an
issue
in
the
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
other
side
argued
the
other
way?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
that
--
in
that
connection
then
do
you
accept
your
adversary's
view
of
the
record
that
there's
absolutely
nothing
to
indicate
that
he
had
any
knowledge
whatever
that
by
serving
in
the
japanese
army
he
risked
forfeiting
his
american
citizenship?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
do
agree?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
might
that
not
bear
on
the
question
whether
in
fact
conscription,
even
in
the
sense
you
suggested,
was
voluntary?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
just
wondering
whether
what
he
did
not
do
is
very
meaningful
in
a
situation
in
which
it
doesn't
appear
they
have
any
knowledge
of
the
consequences
of
what
was
failure
to
do
might
mean.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
page
did
you
say?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
davis,
i
don't
know
if
i
fully
follow
this.
are
you
giving
us
arguments
dealing
with
burden
of
proof
which
go
to
the
interpretation
of
subsection
(c)
or
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
although
there's
nothing
at
all,
explicitly,
they're
dealing
with
burden
of
proof
in
the
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
where
--
where
congress
says
nothing.
i'm
thinking
off
the
top
of
my
head.
why
are
we
at
all
governed
in
respect
of
the
matters
of
burden
of
proof
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
by
anything
that's
in
the
--
in
the
legislative
history.
