mr.
davis,
may
i
ask
you,
i
should
take
it
this
is
one
of
the
cases
maybe
where
burden
of
proof
would
be
rather
important.
would
you
think
if
the
burden
of
proof
was
on
him,
in
connection
with
defending
his
citizenship
show
that
when
he
is
ordered
into
the
army
in
japan
he
had
to
go?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
just
thought
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
don't
see
from
what
you've
just
said
how
he
could
possibly
done
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
--
on
--
if
that's
your
evidence,
if
that's
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
he
didn't,
suppose
--
suppose
he'd
said,
“i
don't
believe
a
word
you've
said.”
could
you
then
deprive
him
of
his
citizenship
on
the
ground
that
he
didn't
have
to
go
when
he
was
ordered?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
burden
--
the
burden
would
be
on
him
to
show
that.
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
the
trial
where
you
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
your
citizenship.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
without
more
you
think
that
was
enough
for
a
judge
to
make
a
finding,
that
he
went
over
there
for
the
deliberate
purpose
of
getting
in
the
army?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that's
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
was
not
under
duress,
i'm
--
i'm
interested
in
the
viewpoint,
but
he
had
a
dual
citizenship
and
he
was
under
that
--
he
didn't
respond
to
either
offenses
that's
all
in.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
be
true
in
this
country?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
a
quite
difference
between
the
voluntary
and
the
constituted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
didn't
he
prove
duress
when
he
proved
he's
conscripted?
i
could
get
to
where
the
arguments.
but
after
he's
conscripted
to
somewhere,
accused
it
or
ordered
by
statute.
he
tried
to
get
out
but
he's
already
in,
he's
in
by
being
conscripted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
you
said
he
was.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
say
after
he
was
notified,
he
was
going
to
be
conscripted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
should
have
immediately
moved.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i've
heard
sometimes
they
do.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
it
was
a
year
before
pearl
harbor
that
you
say
he
should
have
known
we
were
going
to
get
in
a
war?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
decided
in
this
litigation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
decision
of
the
court
in
the
penn-delco
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
true
in
the
monaco
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
these
references
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
was
the
evidence
found
that
he
was
a
subject
to
draft
in
connection
with
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
we
ask
that
in
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
might
not
believe
it
and
still
not
have
enough
evidence
to
show
that
it
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
he
did
know
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
may
not
believe
his
statement
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
what
he
said?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
government
offer
any
evidence
to
show
that
those
rumors
were
not
true?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
also
said
that
he
told
a
friend
of
his
who
work
as
american
himself
of
him.
and
that
his
claim
to
the
american
embassy
who
told
him
or
consulate
there'll
be
nothing
for
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
evidence
to
show
that
was
false?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
record
of
those
claims,
either
he
didn't
do
something
but
these
japanese
were
there
and
called
a
disposition?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
there
any
record
that
we
can
find
that
shows
that
to
be
true?
justice
hugo
l.
black
wouldn't
he
violate
the
law
of
japan
by
leaving
after
his
conscription?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
citizens
of
who
which
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
those
cases
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
congress
passed
a
law
and
the
man
is
charged
with
murder
because
of
the
law,
on
the
charge,
he
has
a
burden
of
proof
if
he
was
innocent.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
raises
a
question
i
have
identified
as
what
a
man's
citizenship
been
taken
away
from
him,
so
the
(inaudible)
if
then,
congress
could
go,
holding
it
could
be
taken
away
without
a
proof.
justice
hugo
l.
black
let
me
ask
you
one
question.
does
your
argument
(inaudible)
on
some
of
the
ideas
that
congress
has
the
right
to
say
that
courts
have
the
(inaudible)
or
infer
on
the
fact
that
a
man
has
been
conscripted
and
served
in
a
foreign
army,
and
he
went
involuntarily?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
that
such
as
anywhere
here
that
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
gist
within
murata
and
okumura
cases,
since
they
would
think
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
these
men
have
the
evidence
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
finding
of
duress.
