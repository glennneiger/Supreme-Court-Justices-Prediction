mr.
fred
okrand
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
davis.
this
case
can
and
should,
in
my
judgment,
be
decided
without
the
court
having
to
reach
the
constitutional
question.
in
any
way
that
the
court
looks
at
the
evidence
in
this
case,
petitioner
is
entitled
a
judgment
either
because
the
lower
court
failed
to
apply
proper
rules
of
interpretation
of
evidence
as
this
court
has
said
it
should
in
an
expatriation
case
or
because
it
imposed
the
burden
of
proof
upon
the
petitioner
when
the
burden
of
proof
ought
to
be
properly
imposed
upon
the
government
in
an
expatriation
case.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
--
in
this
case
are
simple
and
there
is
no
conflict
of
evidence.
the
government
introduced
no
evidence
in
the
case.
petitioner
was
born
in
california
in
1916.
he
went
to
school
in
california
and
lived
there
all
his
life,
graduating
from
stanford
university.
on
his
graduation
as
is
the
case
with
many
of
our
american
boys,
he
had
a
chance
too
and
did
go
to
japan
for
study
and
to
visit.
his
expenses
were
being
paid
by
his
father.
he
went
in
1939.
in
california,
his
father
and
mother
both
lived
in
california
and
both
his
father
and
mother
remained
in
california
when
he
went
to
japan
to
study
and
to
visit.
as
luck
would
have
it
while
he
was
in
japan
in
1939,
his
father
died.
and
he
had
no
funds
with
which
to
return
to
this
country
and
he
went
to
work
in
an
aircraft
plant.
in
1940,
for
--
i
failed
to
mention
and
i
think
i
--
it's
important
that
i
do.
being
born
in
california
in
1916,
that
is
before
1924,
of
japanese
born
parents,
he
was,
of
course,
under
united
states
law
an
american
citizen,
born
an
american
citizen.
and
he
was
also
under
japanese
law,
a
japanese
citizen
by
virtue
of
that
birth
to
japanese
born
parents.
so
that
when
he
went
to
japan
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
1939,
he
had
both
nationalities.
the
record
is
not
clear
as
to
whether
he
knew
that
fact
in
1939
but
the
fact
is
that
he
did
have
both
nationalities.
japan,
at
that
time,
had
a
compulsory
universal
military
conscription
law
for
its
nationals
which
provided
severe
criminal
penalties
for
evasion
thereof.
in
1940,
under
that
conscription
law,
petitioner
was
required
to
take
a
physical
examination
under
the
law.
had
he
not
taken
it,
he
would
be
subject
to
those
criminal
penalties.
he
took
the
examination.
and
in
--
that
was
in
june
of
1940.
and
in
march
of
1941,
he
was
inducted
under
this
conscription
law
into
the
japanese
army.
following
the
war
--
mr.
fred
okrand
he
did
not
and
i
will
deal
with
that
subject
in
a
moment,
because
that,
as
i
understand
the
government's
position,
is
its
main
case.
that
is
on
what
they
rely
to
show
voluntary
conduct
and
upon
what
they
rely
to
show
proof
of
voluntary
conduct.
mr.
fred
okrand
absence
of
duress.
of
course
in
our
view,
the
government
has
to
go
forward
and
show
that
it
was
voluntary,
but
i
will
deal
with
that
no
protest
in
a
moment.
after
the
war,
he
applied
at
the
american
consulate
in
--
in
japan
to
return
to
the
united
states
and
was
told
at
that
time
that
he
was
not
any
longer
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
for
reason
of
this
military
service
under
the
regulations
which
were
in
effect
then
and
are
in
effect
now.
he
was
issued
by
the
american
consulate
a
document
entitled
"certificate
of
the
loss
of
the
nationality
of
the
united
states".
this
document
was
executed
by
the
vice
consul
and
approved
by
the
state
department
here
in
washington.
after
he
received
that
document
and
the
denial
of
his
passport
application,
he
filed
suit
in
the
district
court
in
los
angeles
for
a
declaration
as
to
whether
he
had
lost
his
united
states
citizenship
and
was
permitted
under
the
law
then
in
effect
to
come
to
california
for
his
trial.
the
trial
court
ruled
against
him
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
mr.
fred
okrand
yes,
there
is,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
okrand
there
is
the
--
the
japanese
military
service
law
is
in
the
record.
mr.
fred
okrand
yes.
mr.
fred
okrand
setting
forth
the
criminal
penalty
that
is
provided
in
the
--
in
the
event
of
--
of
refusal
to
comply
with
the
order.
in
addition,
we
think
there
is
also
in
the
record,
although
there
are
some
dispute
between
government
counsel
and
ourselves.
the
fact
that
this
court
can
take
judicial
notice
of
the
situation
in
japan
in
1940
and
1941
which
is
the
critical
date,
1941,
namely,
that
it
is
a
totalitarian
--
was
a
totalitarian
government
which
could
not
have
been
expected
to
brook
any
violation
of
its
draft
laws
at
that
time.
mr.
fred
okrand
not
in
the
record.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
specifically
except
the
petitioner's
testimony.
mr.
fred
okrand
which
was
that
he
was
afraid
to
go
to
the
american
consul
at
that
--
at
that
time
because
of
the
conditions
in
japan,
he
was
under
surveillance
as
a
nisei
which
is
an
american
born
japanese
person.
because
he
feared
that
he
would
be
harmed
by
the
kempeitai,
which
is
the
japanese
military
police,
had
he
done
that.
the
court
below
felt
two
things
that
the
burden
of
proof
was
upon
the
petitioner
to
establish
that
he
served
involuntarily.
in
this,
we
think
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
court
below
was
wrong
and
the
trial
court,
well,
i'm
not
specifically
saying
so
in
this
case,
did
follow
that
legal
theory
that
the
government
has
pointed
out
that
the
trial
court
has
tried
a
number
of
these
cases
and
in
other
opinions
that
he
has
written,
he
stated
that
that
is
his
view
of
the
burden
of
proof.
we
think
that
expatriation
being
as
this
court
has
said,
the
voluntary
renunciation
or
abandonment
of
nationality
or
allegiance,
that
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
government
to
prove
its
entire
case,
to
prove
expatriation.
and
we
think
the
law
--
the
rule
is
and
ought
to
be
that
the
government
must
prove
all
the
elements
of
expatriation
including
the
element
of
voluntary
conduct.
the
court
below
not
having
followed
that
rule
on
that
ground
alone,
we
believe
we
are
entitled
to
a
reversal
of
the
judgment.
on
another
theory,
we
think
that
the
petitioner
is
entitled
to
--
to
a
reversal
of
judgment
and
that
is
the
failure
of
the
courts
below
to
follow
what
this
court
has
said
is
the
rule
in
expatriation
cases.
namely,
that
the
facts
and
the
law
are
to
be
interpreted
so
far
as
it's
reasonable
in
favor
of
the
citizen
and
that
in
the
event
of
any
ambiguity
or
any
doubt,
that
must
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
petitioner.
i
might
say
to
the
court
that
this
case
is
quite
in
conflict,
as
the
government
has
recognized
in
its
response,
to
at
least
the
second
and
third
circuits
and
also
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
on
both
the
burden
of
proof
issue
and
on
the
feature
of
the
case
about
resolving
factual
doubts
in
favor
of
the
citizen.
with
reference
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
petitioner
did
not
protest,
did
not
audibly
protest.he
did
not
go
to
the
american
consulate
nor
did
he
audibly
protest
to
any
japanese
official.
that
feature
of
the
case,
your
honor,
is
the
very
feature
which,
it
is
clear
from
a
reading
of
the
record,
prompted
the
trial
court
to
hold
that
he
affirmatively
acted
voluntarily.
now,
the
government
has
not
disputed
because
it
is
the
fact
and
has
been
for
many
years.
that
the
government
of
a
country
in
which
a
person
is
residing
particularly
if
he
happens
to
be
under
the
law
of
that
state,
a
citizen
or
a
national
of
that
state,
has
the
right
to
require
the
military
service
of
that
individual
whether
the
other
government
wants
it
or
not.
and
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
the
government
has
issued
in
its
state
department
a
little
--
a
little
booklet
which
it
gives
to
persons
who
obtain
passports.
it
has
specifically
stated
that
it
will
not
and
it
does
not
make
any
effort
to
relieve
an
american
citizen,
who
also
happens
to
have
the
nationality
of
a
foreign
state,
from
military
obligation
if
he
is
in
that
state
and
must
respond
to
the
laws
of
that
state.
that
is
not
disputed
by
the
government
and
it
is
the
fact.
mr.
fred
okrand
he
was
told
that
is
in
the
record.
he
was
told
by
a
friend
of
his,
a
nisei
who
happened
to
work
at
the
consul
--
at
the
embassy,
i
believe,
that
there
was
nothing
that
could
be
done
for
him
if
he
should
go
to
the
consulate
and
make
a
request
for
excuse
for
military
service.
now,
i
must
point
out
to
the
court
that
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
things
that
the
trial
court
said
he
did
not
believe
the
petitioner.
i
--
i
say
i
think
it
is
because
it
isn't
clear
but
i
--
i
think
that's
one
of
the
things.
the
trial
court
apparently
did
believe
the
petitioner
when
the
petitioner
testified
that
he
did
not
go
to
the
consulate
but
the
trial
court
apparently
didn't
believe
him
when
he
said
that
the
reason
that
he
didn't
go
was
because
of
fear
that
he
might
have
reprisals
taken
against
him
by
the
kempeitai
or
because
he
felt
that
--
that
the
american
consulate
could
do
nothing
for
him.
mr.
fred
okrand
it's
an
inference
--
well,
it's
--
there
is
no
contradiction
of
the
petitioner's
testimony.
all
the
evidence
was
given
by
the
petitioner,
including
the
documentary
evidence.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
upon
the
conclusion
of
the
petitioner's
case,
the
trial
court
asked
the
petitioner
--
his
counsel,
"do
you
rest?"
and
he
said,
"yes."
without
anything
further,
the
trial
court
said
to
the
government's
counsel,
"do
you
rest?"
and
the
government's
counsel
said,
"yes."
so
that
the
trial
court
felt
obviously
that
the
burden
entirely
was
upon
the
petitioner
to
prove
his
case
and
the
government
had
no
obligation
whatsoever
to
prove
that
--
its
case
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
fred
okrand
oh,
no.
that
is
very
clear.
that
there
is
no
admission
of
that,
the
evidence
is
to
the
contrary,
he
said
he
did
not
know
and
--
and
the
trial
court
also
made
it
very
clear
that
it
was
not
inferring
that
he
did
know.
that
he
would
lose
his
american
citizenship
at
the
time
he
went
into
the
army.
mr.
fred
okrand
well,
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
an
--
that
he
was
told
by
this
friend
that
he
couldn't
get
any
relief.
he
probably
wouldn't
except
that
a
person,
normally,
i
should
think,
in
ordinary
circumstances
would
rather
not
go
into
the
military
service
if
he
can
avoid
it.
perhaps
in
some
compulsion
of
some
kind
of
war
or
something
like
that.
so
that
the
--
but
the
evidence
is
very
clear
that
he
did
not
know
that
he
would
lose
his
american
citizenship
by
going
into
the
japanese
army.
mr.
fred
okrand
it
was
before
we
were
at
war
with
japan.
i
may
point
out
to
your
honors
that
there
have
been
a
number
of
cases
involving
italian
military
service
in
which
the
courts
have
taken
into
consideration
the
fact
that
this
was
in
a
totalitarian
type
of
country
and
in
peace
time
and
this
was
likewise
before
we
were
at
war
and
i
may
say
that
the
trial
court
viewed
it
in
just
the
other
way.
the
trial
court
viewed
it
in
the
sense
that
he
ought
to
have
known
we
were
going
to
get
into
war.
i
will
not
make
reference
to
pearl
harbor
as
to
my
views
as
to
whether
i
think
the
trial
court
was
correct
in
imposing
that
burden
upon
the
petitioner
to
have
known
that
we
were
going
to
get
into
a
--
mr.
fred
okrand
i
think
this,
your
honor,
i
think
i
can
conceive
of
a
situation
--
well,
perhaps
not
controlling
where
he
would
be
relevant.
in
other
words,
if
an
individual
knew
that
he
was
going
to
lose
his
citizenship
by
this,
there
could
be
a
situation
where
that
would
have
relevance
as
to
the
voluntariness
of
his
conduct.
mr.
fred
okrand
if
he
--
if
he
didn't
know
and
then
there
can
be
none
of
this
implied
waiver
that
--
that
seems
to
run
from
the
government's
briefs
except
that
they
always
had.
i
want
to
save
a
little
bit
of
time.
there
is
one
other
argument
that
i'd
like
to
--
one
of
the
point
that
i'd
like
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention.
oh,
before
i
do
that,
one
other
--
one
other
matter.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
and
the
third
circuit
very
clearly
and
in
my
judgment
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
this
district,
for
the
district
of
columbia
has
stated
as
a
rule
of
evidentiary
law
that
conscription
into
the
army
of
a
foreign
country
under
compulsion
of
law
raises
a
presumption
of
involuntary
conduct,
irrespective
of
where
the
burden
of
proof
may
lie
to
prove
voluntariness
or
involuntariness.
and
those
circuits
have
held
that
absent
proof
by
the
government
overcoming
that
presumption,
a
petitioner
in
the
--
a
position
of
--
of
this
petitioner
here
is
entitled
to
a
reversal
of
a
trial
court's
judgment
withheld
--
which
held
that
he
served
voluntarily.
the
circuit
below,
the
ninth
circuit
of
course
held
to
the
contrary
and
held
that
there
is
no
presumption
of
--
of
involuntary
conduct
by
reason
of
conscription.
that
will
be
it
under
compulsion
of
law
carrying
a
criminal
penalty.
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief
also
one
other
reason
why
this
court
need
not
and
ought
not
read
the
--
reach
the
constitutional
issue.
we
suggest
that
this
statute
ought
not
to
be
applied
to
this
factual
situation,
namely,
conscription
under
law
carrying
military
--
carrying
criminal
penalties
of
a
national
resident
at
that
time
in
that
country.
in
answer
to
the
government's
suggestion
that
then
the
statute
would
not
apply
to
anyone,
we
reply
that
it
would
in
fact
apply
to
the
very
individuals
which
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
passed
this
particular
bit
of
legislation.
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
is
set
forth
at
some
length
in
the
opinion
of
the
first
circuit
in
the
dos
reis
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
it
sets
forth
a
great
deal
of
the
legislative
history,
namely,
to
take
away
citizenship
from
those
individuals
who
have
shown
by
their
conduct
that
they
want
to
throw
off
citizenship
of
the
united
states
and
adhere
to
nationality
of
another
state.
now,
we
say
that
--
if
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
statute
then
it
ought
not
be
applied
to
this
case
because
all
that
there
is
in
this
case
is
a
person
responding
to
the
law
of
the
country
in
which
he
happens
to
be.
one
other
point
and
i
shall
sit
down.
in
kawakita
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
which
was
a
treason
case
in
which
the
arguments
were
just
the
other
way
around.
petitioner
was
claiming
loss
of
citizenship
and
the
governor
was
saying
--
the
government
was
saying
not.
the
government
made
the
point
that
conduct
requires
by
the
law
of
a
foreign
state,
in
which
a
person
was
living,
could
not
be
used
against
him.
he
was
excused.
it
was
the
word
of
the
government.
now,
if
that
be
true,
that
is
another
reason
why
the
statute
ought
not
to
be
applied
for
this
factual
situation.
mr.
fred
okrand
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
are
asking
more
but
we
are
entitled
to
that
at
the
least.
mr.
fred
okrand
because
as
i
view
the
--
all
the
other
circuits,
except
this
one,
in
the
third
and
the
second
in
the
district
of
columbia
precisely
on
this
type
of
a
record,
those
circuits
did
not
remand
but
the
one
exception
on
the
bruni
case,
the
latest
one,
did
not
remand
but
simply
held
that
--
that
on
the
record,
the
government
had
not
repelled
the
presumption
of
--
of
involuntariness
and
therefore
petitioner
was
entitled
a
judgment.
but
at
the
minimum,
we're
entitled
to
a
reassessment
in
the
--
on
the
--
in
the
light
of
correct
burden
of
proof.
mr.
fred
okrand
well,
then
we
come
to
the
constitutional
question.
mr.
fred
okrand
yes,
sir.
no.
mr.
fred
okrand
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
fred
okrand
well,
we
have
--
mr.
fred
okrand
yes,
we
have
raised
a
constitutional
question
in
the
brief.
mr.
fred
okrand
but
it
would
be
duplicating
to
it.
mr.
fred
okrand
very
clearly,
there
is
no
question
about
that.
and
of
course
that's
one
of
the
basis
for
our
argument
for
the
--
why
the
statute
should
not
be
applied
here.
mr.
fred
okrand
it
is
with
regret
that
i
find
myself
disagreeing
with
government
counsel
in
a
statement
yesterday
that
there
are
no
cases
on
appeal
in
which
there
was
not
a
protest
of
some
type
made
by
the
petitioner
or
by
the
person
claiming
citizenship.
in
our
opening
brief,
at
pages
25
and
26,
we
have
called
attention
to
at
least
two
or
three
cases,
the
main
one
is
the
lehmann
case
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out.
mr.
fred
okrand
page
25.
the
omissions
which
were
relied
upon
by
the
government
to
show
voluntary
conduct.
i
call
attention
to
the
second
and
third
that
at
a
visit
to
the
american
consulate,
he
did
not
specifically,
did
not
asked
specifically
for
the
protection
of
the
american
consulate
and
expressed
no
desire
to
register
as
an
american
citizen.
and
number
three,
he
did
not
protest
that
the
time
he
entered
the
swiss
army
or
at
the
time
he
took
the
oath
of
allegiance.
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
said,
"with
respect
to
these
admissions,
it
need
only
be
said
that
they
were
utterly
irrelevant
to
the
critical
issue
of
voluntariness."
in
another
case,
monaco
against
dulles,
which
we
also
call
attention
to,
not
only
was
there
no
protest
but
the
citizen
actually
ignored
the
warnings
of
the
state
department
when
he
was
leaving
the
united
states
when
they
told
them,
he
ought
not
to
go
until
he
made
sure
that
he
would
not
have
to
serve
in
the
italian
army.
and
even
in
the
penn-delco
case
upon
which
the
government
relies
and
which
we
call
attention
to
on
the
next
page,
the
government
stresses
the
fact
that
the
plaintiff
did
not
protest
to
any
united
states
consulate
that
he
was
being
forced
to
enter
italian
military
service
under
duress.
so
i
think
it's
clear
that
a
number
of
appellate
cases
have
had
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
duress
was
necessary.
but
more
important
--
mr.
fred
okrand
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
fred
okrand
for
the
--
for
the
citizen.
mr.
fred
okrand
in
the
monaco
and
in
the
lehmann.
more
important
from
our
view
is
the
fact
that
we
believe
that
this
court
has
decided
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
protest
in
order
to
protect
one
citizenship.
in
the
mandoli
case,
which
is
number
15
in
the
1952
term,
at
page
23
of
the
record,
finding
number
3
by
the
trial
court
is
this,
the
plaintiff
was
inducted
into
the
italian
army
and
served
in
the
italian
army
from
april
14,
1931
to
september
5th,
1931.
he
did
not
protest
his
induction
in
to
the
army.
your
honors
will
recall
that
on
that
issue,
the
government
confessed
error.
now
calling
the
attention
to
the
government's
brief
in
the
mandoli
case
at
page
16,
footnote
3,
the
government
said,
“the
solicitor
general
did
not
authorize
an
appeal
in
tomasicchio
against
acheson,
98
fed.
supp.
166,
whereon
facts
essentially
similar
to
those
here,
the
trial
court
held
that
the
claimant
had
not
lost
his
american
citizenship,
this
is
the
government's
explanation
as
to
why
they
didn't
appeal
because
the
district
court's
ruling
on
this
point
was
viewed
as
correct.
mr.
fred
okrand
these
are
not.
no.
mr.
fred
okrand
yes.
i
first
called
attention
with
the
mandoli
--
cases
referred
to
on
my
brief
but
not
these
particular
references.
i
called
attention
to
page
23
of
the
record
to
finding
number
3.
mr.
fred
okrand
in
the
mandoli
case.
that's
number
15
of
the
1952
term.
and
i
next
called
attention
to
footnote
3
on
page
16
of
the
government's
brief
in
the
mandoli
case.
mr.
fred
okrand
i
cannot
say
but
have
it
with
the
experience
in
the
other
cases,
i
would
say
the
very
unlikely
if
he
did
not
testify.
i'm
reasonably
sure
he
didn't.
one
more
reference
on
this
point,
this
also
is
not
referred
to
in
our
brief,
it's
the
tomasicchio
case
to
which
the
government
had
reference
in
its
mandoli
brief.
i
want
to
call
attention
briefly
to
the
statement
of
the
court
on
page
174
of
98
federal
supplement.
the
government
argues
that
the
plaintiff
was
under
a
duty
to
protest
against
--
they
drafted
into
the
italian
army
and
not
to
submit
without
a
contest.
no
doubt,
however,
a
protest
would
have
been
futile
and
a
refusal
to
take
the
oath
would
have
been
equally
ineffective.
the
plaintiff
might
well
have
feared
severe
reprisal
--
reprisals
if
he
either
protested
or
contested
the
order
to
respond
to
the
draft.
during
the
fascist
regime
in
italy,
it
would
have
been
realistic
to
fear
such
an
eventuality.
the
government,
now
the
court
is
using
the
government
in
a
broader
sense,
does
not
restrict
its
solicitude
to
stouthearted
men,
the
timid,
the
weak,
and
the
ignorant
are
equally
entitled
to
its
protection.
the
law
does
not
exact
a
crown
of
martyrdom
as
a
condition
of
retaining
citizenship.
mr.
fred
okrand
out
of
these?
first,
i
get
the
proposition
of
law
that
if
one
is
conscripted
into
the
army,
that
raises
a
presumption
of
involuntary
conduct.
next
–-
mr.
fred
okrand
--
an
absent
--
absent
proof
--
mr.
fred
okrand
yes,
absent
--
yes,
he
can
rest
and
i
understand
every
--
mr.
fred
okrand
well,
i
believe
that
the
fact
that
conscription
alone
does
as
a
matter
of
law
prove
duress
absent,
the
government
coming
forward
with
anything
else
to
overcome
that.
mr.
fred
okrand
yes.
mr.
fred
okrand
well,
the
lehmann
case
does,
your
honor.
the
lehmann
case,
the
augello
case
in
the
second
circuit,
and
i
think
--
mr.
fred
okrand
yes.
mr.
fred
okrand
that's
correct.
mr.
fred
okrand
that's
correct.
mr.
fred
okrand
that's
what
they
say.
mr.
fred
okrand
well
--
mr.
fred
okrand
not
in
the
lehmann
case,
not
in
the
lehmann
case.
the
talk
about
the
fascist
government
--
mr.
fred
okrand
the
lehmann.
that's
from
the
third
circuit
and
the
augello
case
from
the
second
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
fred
okrand
i
agree,
your
honor.
but
the
lehmann
and
augello
cases
do
not
go
off
on
that
second
point.
one
further
matter,
i
think
i
have
to
bring
up,
we
do
read
the
statute
as
the
government
says
we
do.
we
read
the
statute
as
requiring
in
it
proof
of
voluntary
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
government.
we
read
it
from
the
perkins
versus
elg
case
which
says
that
expatriation
is
the
voluntary
renunciation
or
abandonment
of
nationality
or
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
fred
okrand
in
the
--
in
the
okimura-murata,
that
case
came
up
here
on
the
government's
direct
appeal
on
the
issue
of
constitutionality.
mr.
fred
okrand
not
on
the
government's
--
not
on
the
government's
appeal.
the
trial
court
found
that
the
statute
was
under
unconstitutional,
although,
there
had
been
conscription
and
there
was
conscription
in
the
case
but
the
government's
appeal
was
on
--
mr.
fred
okrand
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor,
at
least
two
of
the
justices
felt
that
there
was
sufficient
in
the
--
mr.
fred
okrand
yes,
sir.
yes.
well,
but
the
court
did
send
it
back.
mr.
fred
okrand
well,
the
court
did
not
reach
the
constitutional
question
and
one
of
the
trial
court
to
reach
the
issues
of
fact
first,
as
the
trial
court
did
on
remand.
i
was
going
to
say
that
i
get
--
i
read
the
statute
as
requiring
voluntary
proof
by
the
proof
of
voluntariness
by
the
government
from
the
perkins
case
and
from
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
which
is
set
forth
into
those
recent
cases
at
some
length,
in
which
the
government
made
a
very
strenuous
effort
to
read
out
the
requirement
of
voluntary
conduct.
in
some,
what
the
government's
case
is,
is
that
even
though
there
is
conscription,
(a),
that
is
not
sufficient,
and
(b)
it
is
necessary
for
the
petitioner
to
go
forward
and
show
something
else,
something
--
some
--
after
some
kind
which
would
lead
to
he's
disobeying
the
law
of
the
state
in
which
he
is
residing.
and
the
government
goes
further
and
tries
to
find
proof
of
voluntariness
by
the
so-called
"lack
of
protest."
