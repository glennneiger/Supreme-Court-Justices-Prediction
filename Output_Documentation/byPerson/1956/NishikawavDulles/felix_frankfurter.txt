justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
the
first
--
what
about
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
this
--
if
that
were
made
of
criminal
defense,
as
i
understand
the
law
or
the
government
would
have
to
prove
is
that
what
you
call
the
objective
facts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
--
if
the
defendant
read
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
case
the
code
of
the
jury,
it
couldn't
be
withdrawn
because
there
isn't
basis
for
proving
it
beyond
unreasonable
doubt
the
conviction
was
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
may
i
come
to
you
to
state,
in
what
--
what
proposition
of
law
you
get
out
of
all
these
citations?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
and
approve
and
he
can
rest
on
that
presumption?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
every
--
the
circumstances
in
each
case,
it
doesn't
follow
because
in
one
case
conscript
--
protest
would
be
futile,
that
that
can
be
a
record
as
for
generalizing
the
rule
of
law
that
conscription
in
itself
necessarily
proved
or
as
a
matter
of
law
proved
duress,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
proposition
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
the
case
that
you've
cited
for
me
do
not
establish.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
lay
down
that
rule
of
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
all
they
talk
about
what
fascist
regime
and
the
dangers
of
it
are
unnecessary.
justice
felix
frankfurter
unless
a
conscription
means
obedience
to
--
coercive
demand
of
government.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
they
say
–-
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
all
the
duress
is
needless.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all
thrown
in.
but
to
throw
it
in,
they
make
a
difference
on
the
facts
of
the
particular
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
case
--
what
case
doesn't?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
one
thing
to
say
that
conscription
in
and
of
itself
establishes
coercion.
it's
another
thing
to
say
that
in
specific
cases,
there
was
conscription
in
the
attending
circumstances
proved
that
it
was
coercive
though
it's
a
very
different
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
--
what
do
you
do
to
the
suggestion
that
this
court
sent
back
and
ascertain
the
fact
although
there
was
conscription?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
the
other
the
questions
weren't
in
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
i
don't
see
why
we
should
have
sent
it
back
on
that
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
but,
i'm
constantly
told
two
of
the
justices,
decisions
of
this
court
or
by
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
sometimes
in
a
dissent
that
doesn't
mean
that
--
that
the
court
hasn't
decided
against
and
what
is
this
business
of
the
two
of
the
justices?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
wirin.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
that
they
were
extirpated
before
they
were
cut
out
from
this
record,
the
testimony
of
the
petitioner.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
would
there
be
left
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
there
--
what
is
the
residuum
of
the
testimony
of
the
petitioner
on
the
basis
of
a
cross-examination?
in
short,
while
he
may
disbelieve
the
petitioner,
while
the
trial
judge
will
disbelieve
a
petitioner
and
it
expels
the
glory
of
favorable
testimony
or
negative
testimony,
the
case
may
be
made
out
against
him
on
cross-examination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
what
extent,
is
that
true
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
does
the
record
show?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
abstraction
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
statute
itself
shed
no
light.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
see
if
i
understand
that.
you
say
that
if
the
government
proved
the
external
fact
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
external
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
claimant
that
doesn't
--
it
come
for
the
--
he
put
in
no
proof
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
go
against
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i'm
talking
the
one
you're
talking
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
was
this
--
this
is
--
when
was
this?
(inaudible)
what
he
didn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
now,
how
much
of
an
inference
against
him
to
withdraw
that
during
that
period,
he
didn't
take
the
affirmative
step
in
saying,
“i
only
renounce
any
responsibility
in
the
japanese
law
because
i'm
an
american.”
you
think
that's
fair
--
that
was
fair?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
inference
of
actuality
or
to
ask
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
to
japan
all
those
months?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
asking.
i
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
just
try
to
face
myself
in
that
situation
and
maybe
i'm
making
strong
attribution
on
what
the
feeling
of
japan
at
that
time
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
waved
the
american
flag.
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
this
point,
and
perhaps,
you
displayed
a
--
i
need
to
ask
you
what
i'd
like
to
know
whether
we
can
take
any
--
take
judicial
notice
on
the
basis
on
the
theory
the
department
has
or
otherwise
of
--
what
was
the
condition
--
in
one
of
the
conditions
in
japan
in
compelling
simply
to
enter
the
japanese
army?people
of
japanese
sons,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
can
--
i
should
think
that
it's
appeared
in
other
cases
might
be
almost
did
it
show
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
respect
your
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
you're
saying
--
are
you
saying
that
i
must
rid
my
mind
of
any
notion
that
on
the
whole,
the
japanese
made
it
almost
impossible
to
allow
it
in
this
situation
not
to
enter
the
japanese
army.
justice
felix
frankfurter
puts
on
pressure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that
they
wanted
some
sure
good
faith?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
to
say
he
didn't
say
anything
that
--
did
he
make
the
kind
of
assertions
that
you
are
--
hypothetically,
he
said
he
could've
made?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
to
say
did
he
duly
say
but
did
he
explain
at
the
trial
why
he
went?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
you're
having
the
burden
of
--
of
sustaining
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute
which
shuts
off
all
explanation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
absolutely
prevents
the
government
by
saying
it
gives
--
he
may
prove
coerced
entering
into
an
army.
we
have
a
different
kind
of
a
statute
and
if
congress
said
and
you
had
to
defend,
we
don't
care
why
he's
in
the
army,
duress
or
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
was
ordered
but
that's
not
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
these
all
individual
legislators?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
the
department,
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
it
got
into
the
congress
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
was
there
any
--
any
--
either
adoption
of
what
this
committee
of
the
cabinet
said
or
were
there
any
independent
utterance
by
someone
in
charge
of
the
bill
in
either
house
who
spoke
on
this
subject?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
he
was
the
chairman,
wasn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
they
adopted
--
they
--
they
adopted
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
say
at
the
same
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
same
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
it's
one
piece
of
legislation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
trial
judge
may
believe
things
said
adversely.
he
said
adverse
to
a
witness,
he
disbelieved
everything
else.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
fact
that's
the
common
thing
about
liars.
justice
felix
frankfurter
23.
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
though
you
reversed
the
california?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
the
intent
of
my
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
raises
a
question,
mr.
wirin,
which
as
in
term
as
argument
whether
the
congress
or
a
court
judge
compel
a
dual
citizen
--
citizen
to
make
the
choice
for
his
american
citizen
and
the
other
nation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
it's
there
down
between
your
last
point.
