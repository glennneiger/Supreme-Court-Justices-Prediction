mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
if
the
court
please.
virgil
herdman,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
the
complainant,
the
plaintiff
in
the
original
trial
of
the
case.
this
case
was
tried
in
the
district
court
of
columbus,
ohio
and
submitted
on
the
basis
of
res
ipsa
loquitur.
only
the
complainant,
the
petitioner
and
his
two
doctors
testified.
at
the
end
of
the
case,
the
court
directed
the
verdict
for
the
respondent
railroad.
virgil
herdman
worked
for
22
years
for
the
respondent
railroad
as
a
brakeman
and
as
a
freight
conductor.
back
in
1951,
his
work
then
was
as
a
freight
conductor.
he
worked
from
columbus,
ohio
to
richmond,
indiana
and
back
on
the
following
day
working
seven
days
a
week.
his
work
as
a
freight
conductor
was
that
of
the
paperwork
on
the
freight
train.
he
rode
in
the
caboose
and
performed
his
work
as
the
train
moved
along
at
prescribed
route,
from
one
city
to
another
and
from
one
railroad
yard
to
another.
he
had
the
responsibility
of
the
bills
of
lading
and
as
he
said,
he
checked
them
and
wrote
them
up
as
the
train
moved
from
one
place
to
another
and
he
set
of
the
bills
of
lading
when
the
cars
were
set
off
in
their
prescribed
place.
it
was
customary
that
all
the
paperwork
be
concluded,
by
the
time
the
train
reached
it's
--
the
end
of
its
destination.
in
the
caboose
was
provided
not
only
a
bunk
to
rest
on
but
a
table
and
chair
on
which
the
petitioner
was
to
perform
his
paperwork
as
they
move
from
city
to
city.
herdman,
as
he
testified,
was
in
charge
of
the
train
from
the
caboose
forward
to
the
coal
tender,
not
including
the
coal
tender,
the
diesel
locomotive
and
the
steam
locomotive
that
made
up
this
train.
in
february
1st,
1951,
the
train
in
which
he
was
riding
consisted
of
about
67
freight
cars.
a
diesel
locomotive,
coal
tender
and
a
steam
engine
on
the
head
end.
they
had
left
richmond,
indiana
and
was
proceeding
eastwardly
through
dayton,
ohio.
virgil
was
working
in
the
caboose
as
prescribed
with
his
paperwork.
when
they
reached
the
point
within
the
yard
limits
or
what's
called
sometimes
the
dayton
limits
of
the
respondent
railroad
near
the
city
of
dayton,
at
a
point
were
there
was
no
reason
to
stop
about
three
miles
as
a
matter
of
fact
from
the
next
stop,
three
miles
from
the
next
yards,
a
certain
--
a
running
of
a
slack
occurred.
the
caboose
was
jerked
violently
forward.
the
petitioner
was
thrown
from
his
position,
the
edge
of
a
bunk
forward
into
the
caboose
into
the
wall
and
down.
the
man
working
in
the
caboose
with
him
landed
on
top
of
him,
and
he
sustained
personal
injuries.
he
got
out
of
the
caboose.
some
few
minutes
afterwards,
he
walked
outside,
heard
the
air
coming
back
through
the
air
line
of
the
caboose
and
got
back
in.
the
railroad
owed
virgil
herdman,
by
common
law
and
under
the
fela,
a
duty
to
provide
him
a
safe
place
to
work.
this
is
a
continuing
duty.
his
safe
place
to
work
supposedly
was
within
the
caboose
area.
it
was
there
he
was
to
do
his
work,
the
same
as
the
engineer
in
the
engine
and
the
fireman
in
the
engine
on
the
locomotive.
when
that
violent
running
of
slack
occurred,
his
place
to
work
was
then
made
unsafe.
he
was
thrown
from
one
end
of
the
caboose
to
the
other
and
sustained
the
injuries
to
the
extent
that
he
has
not
returned
to
work
since
then,
that's
february
1951.
he
testified.
the
facts
showed
that
after
he
got
out
of
the
caboose
and
he
heard
the
air
coming
back
in,
he
knew
then
that
something
had
occurred
in
the
frontend
of
the
train
to
cause
the
sudden
stop
of
the
train
and
the
running
of
the
slack
in
the
subsequent
injury.
he
got
back
on
the
caboose.
they
rode
on
into
the
dayton
yards,
completed
their
work,
come
on
into
columbus,
ohio
and
completed
the
run
of
the
train
some
time
around
midnight
that
night.
if
the
court
please,
it
is
the
claim
of
the
petitioner
that
those
facts,
so
setup
showed
the
duty
of
the
respondent
railroad
to
provide
a
safe
place
to
work.
those
facts
show
a
breach
of
that
duty,
which
constitutes
negligence.
it
is
the
petitioners
claim
then,
that
on
the
basis
of
that
--
of
those
facts,
he
had
a
right
to
expect
his
case
to
go
to
the
jury
on
the
basis
of
res
ipsa
loquitur.
to
go
on
with
the
facts
a
minute,
because
the
defense
of
the
case
has
been
rested
primarily
upon
the
facts
that
occurred
after
this
point,
they
come
on
into
columbus,
ohio
about
midnight.
herdman
as
the
freight
conductor
is
charged
with
all
of
the
paperwork
of
the
train.
about
arriving
in
columbus,
according
to
information
that
came
out
in
the
trial
on
cross-examination
and
which
was
objected
to,
the
engineer
told
herdman
that
he
had
applied
the
brake
in
the
maximum
manner
because
a
car,
an
automobile
went
across
the
crossing.
somebody
wrote
out
a
report.
it
was
herdman's
duty
to
report,
to
do
the
paperwork
of
making
all
reports
and
so
forth,
and
herdman
signed
the
report
that
somebody
else
wrote
out
that
that
was
what
occurred.
herdman,
67
cars,
a
diesel,
a
tender
and
a
steam
locomotive
to
the
rear,
of
course
had
no
personal
knowledge
of
what
took
place
at
the
front
end
of
the
train.
he
could
have
no
personal
knowledge
except
what
somebody
else
told
him
had
occurred.
when
plaintiff's
--
the
petitioner
rested
his
case
on
cross-examination
they
asked
mr.
herdman
if
he
had
not
made
such
a
report
and
the
testimony
as
in
the
record
is
that
he
signed
the
report
that
somebody
else
wrote,
that
he
had
been
told
by
the
engineer
that
that
was
what
had
occurred.
he
personally
had
no
knowledge
whatsoever.
we
respectfully
submit
to
the
court,
that
the
evidence
shows
that
the
stopping
of
the
train
occurred
by
reason
of
some
conduct,
herdman
said,
that
occurred
at
the
front
end
of
the
train.
now,
there
were
two
locomotives
up
there.
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
yes.
that
report
got
in
over
the
objection
of
herdman's
counsel.
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
yes,
sir,
and
it
appears
on
page
32
of
the
record.
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
i
believe
is
where
that
objection
appears.
towards
the
bottom
of
page
32,
question,
"did
the
engineer
told
you
that
he
applied
the
emergency
break
from
hitting
an
automobile
that
came
onto
the
track?"
answer
-
"he
told
me
that."
mr.
mcnamara
-
“i
want
to
object
to
hearsay
in
what
the
engineer
through
this
man
is
not
subject
matter
for
cross-examination.”
mr.
barton
-
“i
think
it
is
entirely
proper
on
cross-examination.”
mr.
mcnamara
-
“the
engineers
are
available
for
testimony.”
the
court
-
“i
will
overrule
the
objection,
note
exception.”
and
then
again
on
the
top
of
page
33
--
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
sir?
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
that
relates
to
the
reading
of
the
report
and
the
statement,
mr.
herdman
had
stated
that
that
was
all
hearsay,
that
he
personally
knew
nothing
about
it,
that
all
that
there
was
in
the
report
was
hearsay.
and
there
was
an
objection
to
cross-examination
as
to
the
hearsay
matter.
if
--
if
the
court
--
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
that
is
right.
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
that
is
right.
mr.
barton
asked
the
petitioner
to
read
it
and
he
had
trouble
reading
the
report.
and
so,
mr.
barton
read
the
reports
to
the
jury.
it's
in
the
record.
he
read
the
report
and
when
he
started
to
ask
the
question,
then
following
that,
we
objected.
we
objected
to
hearsay
and
what
the
engineer
told
this
man
which
stated,
“it
was
not
matters
to
be
brought
out
on
cross-examination.”
the
court
overruled
our
objection.
again,
on
the
top
of
page
33
--
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
no,
sir.
only
the
petitioner
and
his
two
doctors
testified.
the
court
--
the
trial
court
sustained
a
motion
for
a
directed
verdict.
it
was
respectfully
submitted
that
this
court
has
held
many
times
that
res
ipsa
loquitur
is
a
rule
of
evidence
that
applies
in
federal
employer
--
employee
liability
cases.
under
fela,
the
doctrine
does
apply.
this
court
has
held
for
bailey
versus
central
vermont
in
u.s.
administrative
cases
cited
in
there
show
the
continuing
duty
to
provide
the
petitioner
with
the
safe
place
to
work.
the
act
in
itself,
we
think
shows
a
violation
of
that
duty
to
a
point
where
there
is
a
situation
that
the
jury,
an
inference
of
negligence
may
be
drawn
by
the
jury
and
under
the
doctrine
of
res
ipsa
loquitur
as
it
has
been
described,
it
is
compulsory
that
the
matter
go
to
the
jury
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
negligence
for
which
the
respondent
railroad
should
be
held
responsible.
now,
in
the
head
end
--
at
the
head
end
of
this
train,
the
evidence
is
that
the
engineer
on
the
head
end
on
the
steam
engine
could
have
applied
either
intentionally
or
accidentally
that
control
brake
to
throw
this
train
into
a
sudden
stop.
the
engineer
in
the
diesel
could
have
intentionally
or
accidentally
thrown
the
train
into
this
sudden
stop.
the
control
arm
was
described,
i
guess
sort
of
like,
"old
street
tires"
control
arms
that
swings
around
in
a
semicircle
and
can
--
as
mr.
herdman
said,
"there
are
two
ways
in
which
to
use
that
control
arm
to
apply
the
breaks."
they
have
what
they
call
a
service
application,
an
application
of
the
break
that
will
bring
the
train
to
a
smooth
stop,
which
is
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
to
everybody
in
riding
trains.
that
it
is
possible
to
bring
trains
to
a
smooth
even
stop.
you
can
then,
in
the
alternative
throw
the
break,
the
maximum,
what
the
railroad
or
sometime
referred
to
as
big
hauler.
there's
a
niche-like
at
the
end
and
they
throw
it
around
there
and
it
holds
it
in
position
and
they
big
haul
it
and
puts
it
on
the
breaks
in
the
maximum
condition
which
then
will
permit
or
cause
a
running
of
the
slack
and
cause
the
caboose
on
the
rear
end
to
be
jerked
forward
suddenly
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
it
runs
into
the
rear
of
66
other
cars
and
stops.
if
the
court
please,
this
--
this
court
had
before
it,
this
fall
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
case
that
is
cited
in
the
brief,
the
kansas
city
southern
railway
in
justice
case
versus
justice
which
they
denied
the
petition
for
a
writ
by
the
kansas
city
in
southern
railroad.
it
was
a
case
where
the
man
in
the
same
position
as
herdman,
a
freight
conductor
was
riding
and
there
they
knew
that
a
stop
was
to
be
made.
in
the
kansas
city
southern
case,
they
knew
that
a
stop
was
to
be
made
for
an
inspection
and
a
rush
stop
occurred
sufficiently
to
throw
the
conductor
from
one
end
of
the
caboose
to
the
other
and
he
sustained
injuries.
the
case
went
to
the
jury
on
res
ipsa.
there
was
a
$45,000
recovery.
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
down
there,
i
believe
it's
the
fifth
circuit
sustained
it.
the
railroad
then
files
a
petition
for
a
writ
here,
claiming
that
the
case
should
not
have
been
allowed
to
go
to
the
jury
on
res
ipsa
and
this
court
overruled,
in
october
of
this
year.
clearly,
i
think
the
elements
of
res
ipsa
are
all
set
forth
the
movement
of
this
train.
its
actual
control
movement
was
in
that
of
the
engineers
who
in
substance
are
the
respondents.
they
are
the
railroad.
the
exclusive
control
of
the
movement
of
the
train
was
in
the
defendant
railroad.
there
is
no
negligence,
no
inference
of
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner.
he
was
working
in
the
place
where
he
was
assigned
to
work
and
virtually
a
haul
at
the
rear
end
of
the
moving
train,
where
he
has
no
idea,
no
observation
of
what
goes
on
and
no
way
can
control
what
goes
on,
so
that
the
exclusive
control
is
vested
in
and
was
in
the
respondent
railroad.
there
is
no
question
that
the
petitioner
was
not
guilty
of
any
negligence
of
his
own
when
the
sudden
stop
occurred.
third
comes
the
question
on
which
the
other
half
of
the
respondent
railroad's
defense
argument
has
been
made.
was
it
something
that
occurs
in
the
exercise
of
proper
care?
now,
proper
care
--
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
unless
fails
--
someone
fails
to
use
the
(inaudible)
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
the
court
--
the
court
is
right.
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
no.
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
now,
the
testimony
is
on
his.
yes,
they
do.
now
--
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
now,
may
--
may
i
go
on
for
one
moment
as
to
the
testimony
here.
virgil
herdman,
22
years
of
freight
conductor,
says
he
has
been
on
trains
four,
five
or
six
times
in
22
years
in
which
there
was
such
a
sudden
stop.
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
well
--
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
i
--
i
don't
think
that
ordinary
human
experience
need
to
come
in.
i
think
there
was
enough
here
in
the
record.
although,
if
the
court
will
apply
human
--
human
knowledge,
common
knowledge,
i
think
the
court
will
arrive
at
the
same
conclusion.
now
--
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
that
train
--
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
right.
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
that
is
right.
due
care
to
the
man
on
the
rear
end
to
whom
they
owed
care,
not
due
care
to
some
other
condition,
but
due
care,
proper
care
to
the
man
to
whom
they
owed
that
duty
on
the
rear
end
of
the
caboose,
the
man
who
has
no
way
to
protect
himself,
the
man
who
can
receive
no
warning
of
what
is
going
to
happen.
it
is
the
same
as
the
elevator
cases.
elevators,
since
they
were
first
constructed,
since
they
first
built
a
mechanical
lift,
elevators
have
fallen.
they
have
fallen.
i
have
personally
in
the
last
five
years
tried
three
elevator
cases.
so
that
goodness
only
knows
how
many
years
they
have
been
going
on,
fallen
elevators
still
occur.
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
well,
you
and
i
--
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
you
and
i
ride
elevators
and
i
don't
think
there
is
a
more
classic
case
--
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
--
(voice
overlap)
up
the
situation.
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
virgil
herdman
testified
it
is
22
years.
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
no.
not
enough
to
knock
you
off
your
feet.
if
they
did,
passengers
would
not
ride
trains.
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
then,
it
still
goes
to
the
jury.
the
permissible
inference
of
res
ipsa
does
not
say
that
they
must
fine
for
the
plaintiff.
the
application
of
res
ipsa
says
that
the
case
shall
go
to
the
jury
to
determine.
the
permissible
inference
of
negligence
is
to
be
determined
by
the
jury.
now
--
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
no,
sir,
and
this
court
refuse
to
review
that
kansas
city
southern
and
justice
case
where
they
knew
the
train
was
going
to
stop.
the
matter
of
knowledge
is
not
a
basis
for
the
application
of
res
ipsa.
the
--
well,
the
flower
case
is
where
the
guy
walked
--
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
right.
now,
a
violation
of
a
duty
is
that
negligence?
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
we
do
not
know
that
that
is
the
true
situation.
there
isn't
anything
in
the
record
that
that
is
a
true
situation,
mr.
--
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
sir?
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
because
mr.
herdman
said,
“i
was
told
by
the
engineer.”
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
that
is
only
hearsay.
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
well,
there
--
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
yes,
sir.
it
maybe,
that's
right.
but
we
think
the
objection
that
follows
a
little
lower
down
on
the
page
was
sufficient
to
order
to
request
the
court
--
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
it
was
a
--
it
says,
“i
want
to
object
to
hearsay
and
what
the
engineer
told
this
man
is
not
subject
matter
for
cross
examination.”
now,
whether
or
not
it
is
through
the
introduction
of
the
statement
--
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
suppose
i
have
not
done
that?
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
now,
i
still
say
that
it's
a
res
ipsa
situation.
it
is
for
the
jury
to
decide
that
whether
or
not
the
--
the
negligence
is
there.
it
is
not
for
the
court
to
decide
that
the
inference
has
already
been
rebutted.
it
is
a
jury
question
to
decide.
the
court
cannot
intervene
and
say,
“i
think
that
is
a
good
explanation.
i
will
refuse
to
let
the
case
go
to
the
jury.”
now,
the
jury
is
the
one
who
shall
decide
whether
or
not
the
inference
of
negligence
has
been
rebutted
by
the
explanation,
not
the
trial
court.
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
well
--
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
they
are
in
--
they
are
in
the
brief,
the
kansas
city
southern
railway
case
and
justice
which
came
before
this
court.
it's
cited
in
the
--
in
the
brief
where
there
was
a
sudden
stop.
i
think
there
are
quite
a
few
cases
cited
in
there,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
no.
that
was
the
man
working
in
the
caboose
the
same
as
the
petitioner,
a
freight
conductor.
and
he
knew
that
they
were
to
make
a
stop
for
an
inspection,
and
they
made
the
stop
but
they
made
it
so
rough
that
they
threw
him
from
one
end
of
the
caboose
to
the
other,
the
same
as
the
petitioner
and
he
was
hurt.
the
case
--
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
no,
the
duty
--
the
duty
is
--
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
yes.
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
yes,
you
do.
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
you
would
expect
--
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
yes.
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
because
herdman
has
the
right
to
assume
no
stop
will
be
made.
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
we
believe
so.
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
yes.
now,
if
--
if
the
court
please.
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
well,
because
they
have
scheduled
stops.
they
have
scheduled
stops
to
set
off
freight
carts.
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
well,
if
stops
have
to
be
made,
then
it
is
a
question
of
whether
or
not
--
that
is
a
jury
question
then.
the
jury
--
the
jury
can
say,
“this
stop
was
made,
we
think
with
due
care.
the
stop
should
have
been
made.
there
was
no
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
railroad.
mr.
herdman
is
not
entitled
to
recover.”
but
that
is
a
jury
question.
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
herdman
says
it
is
only
--
he
has
only
known
of
such
a
stop,
22
years
in
the
railroad,
he
has
only
been
in
the
caboose
for
five
or
six
times,
i
think
was
his
language.
maximum,
six
times
in
22
years
that
such
a
stop
occurred.
now,
that
is
not
something
that
happens
in
the
ordinary
course
of
events.
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
no
evidence
by
--
no
evidence
by
any
one
except
herdman.
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
well,
he
testified
that
--
i
only
wish
if
i
could
find
it
in
the
record.
if
the
court
please,
it
--
it
is
in
the
record
and
i
cannot
--
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
well
--
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
yes,
yes.
at
the
bottom
of
34
--
let's
see.
it
was
on
--
on
direct
examination.
i
stated
--
or
no,
that's
on
cross-examination,
“that
in
your
experience
as
a
conductor,
you've
been
riding
in
a
caboose
only
about
four
times
when
the
emergency
application
break
made.”
“i
said
a
few
times,
maybe
three,
four
or
five
times.”
“is
that
all
then?”
“answer
-
“i
rode
in
a
caboose
for
years,
but
those
emergency
stops
are
not
a
common
occurrence.”
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
sir?
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
yes.
he
had
known
--
he
had
known
of
it.
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
yes.
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
yes,
yes.
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
and
it
--
it
is
the
same
as
--
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
i
believe
so.
it
is
just
the
same
as,
saying
that,
we
know
of
many
elevator
falls,
but
it
does
not
excuse
their
negligence
if
one
falls
with
you
and
i
on
it.
even
though
i
know
it
happened
many
times,
i'm
going
to
continue
to
ride
them.
it
will
not
excuse
their
negligence.
it
will
permit
--
i
do
believe
that
here
i
will
cut
short
to
try
and
permit
the
completion.
i
think
here
clearly,
the
duty
owing
to
herdman
was
there.
this
was
his
place
to
work.
it
was
the
place
that
he
had
a
right
to
anticipate
would
be
kept
in
a
safe
condition.
there
was
a
violation
of
that
duty
and
it
was
made
unsafe.
no
negligence
on
his
part,
exclusive
control
by
the
railroad,
it
does
not
happen
in
the
common
course
of
events
and
coming
along
afterwards
and
telling
him.
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
it
--
it
is
not
a
common
occurrence.
it
is
not
a
common
occurrence
by
the
testimony
that
is
in
the
record.
it
is
not
a
common
occurrence,
four
times
in
22
years.
it
is
not
a
common
occurrence.
we
believe
that
here,
there
was
an
inference
of
negligence
sufficient
that
the
case
should
be
submitted
on
res
ipsa,
not
that
their
negligence
must
be
bound,
but
that
the
case
should
be
submitted
to
the
jury.
now,
the
defendant
as
i
said
has
--
has
argued
primarily
that
because
virgil
herdman
was
told
about
it
that
that
should
excuse
the
--
the
negligence
or
should
warrant
the
directed
verdict.
now,
the
mere
fact
that
he
was
told
about
it
does
not
in
itself
prevent
the
jury
from
drawing
an
inference
of
negligence
that
that
was
not
a
correct
situation.
the
mere
fact
that
he
was
told
what
took
place
even
if
the
objection
is
not
to
the
introduction
of
the
--
of
the
report
itself
to
any
examination
on
it.
the
fact
that
he
was
told
what
took
place,
it's
up
to
the
jury
to
decide
whether
that
is
sufficient
to
rebut
the
inference
of
negligence.
the
trial
court
apparently
decided
that
the
inference
of
negligence
had
been
rebutted.
and
so,
he
directed
the
verdict
or
else
he
decided
that
res
ipsa
loquitur
doesn't
apply
in
the
railroad
cases,
i
don't
know
which.
i
have
--
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
error
to
admit
this
report?
i
believe
it
was
whether
or
not
my
objection,
if
the
court
please,
was
quick
enough,
i
don't
know.
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
that
it
was
error
to
admit.
no,
but
i
did
say
that
it
was
error
to
cross-examine
him
in
reference
to
hearsay,
matters
that
he
--
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
i
do
not
believe
so.
i
believe
so
--
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
i
--
i
think
that's
right
that
mr.
barton
read
it.
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
well,
he
could
--
he
said
he
couldn't
read
it
and
i
think
in
here
that
he
was
having
a
hard
time
reading
it.
we
said
that
we
have
no
objections
to
mr.
barton
reading
it
and
then
any
questions
in
reference
to
it,
we
objected
to.
i
think
i
have
about
five
minutes
left
i
would
like
to
reserve.
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
in
the
rebuttal
--
mr.
donald
s.
mcnamara
--
very
quickly,
this
record
that
they
introduced
is
not
plaintiff's
evidence.
it
was
marked
defendant's
exhibit
and
introduced
in
the
cross-examination
that
it
is
not
plaintiff's
evidence
which
destroys
the
possibility
of
the
application
of
res
ipsa.
he
said
that
he
discussed
the
matter
of
a
150
feet
of
track
or
something
like
that.
he
is
bringing
matters.
i
don't
know
where
he
got
them.
there
isn't
anything
in
the
record
in
an
effort
to
pervert
the
attention
of
the
court.
depositions
are
improperly
used
here
and
i
would
like
for
you
to
know,
i
will
not
take
the
time
but
if
you
knew
what
the
engineer
had
to
say,
you
would
then
understand
why
the
engineer
was
not
called
to
testify,
why
he
was
not
made
plaintiff's
witness
whom
we
could
not
impeach
from
the
story.
he
told
the
story
is
absolutely
contradictory
to
the
evidence
that
has
been
read
here
from
a
deposition.
now,
it
said,
“defendant's
explanations
may
preclude
recovery,”
and
that
is
exactly
correct.
we
do
not
say
that
we
are
entitled
to
recovery.
we
say
that
the
duty,
the
violation
of
a
duty
and
the
evidence
is
here
to
permit
an
inference
of
negligence
that
should
be
decided
by
the
jury.
the
judge
should
not
say
that
it
was
rebutted.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
collision.
he
cited
two
cases
that
the
court
said,
had
previously
said
where
there
was
a
collision
with
an
automobile,
everything
wasn't
in
exclusive
control
of
the
defendant.
that
is
not
the
true
situation
here.
