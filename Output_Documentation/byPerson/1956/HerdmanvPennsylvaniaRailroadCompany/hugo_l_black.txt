suppose
the
train
did
stop
on
account
of
an
automobile,
what
would
you
say
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
is
that?
justice

black
why
is

justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
--

justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
statement
was
introduced
in
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
was
no
objection
made
to
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
this
court
not
held
several
times
that
the
--
by
hearsay
is
introduced
in
evidence
without
objection?
that
it
--
it
can
be
considered
along
with
the
other
evidence,
it
could
be.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
not
an
objection
to
the
statement.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
you
--
suppose
you
have
not
done
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
you
say
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
cases
have
held
that
a
mere
sudden
stop
is
enough
to
infer
negligence
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
a
mere
sudden
stop?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
would
he
have
a
right
to
assume
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
sometimes
stops
have
to
be
made
on
account
of
objects
on
the
tracks.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
that
this
was
a
stop
of
a
kind
testified
to
by
extra
or
long
railroad
men
with
long
experience
of
a
kind
that
does
not
happen
when
the
train
is
properly
operated?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
evidence
such
as
i've
suggested
that
from
someone
with
experience
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
is
an
extraordinary
stop.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
did
he
say
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
alright.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
why
do
you
have
that
evidence?
it
does
not
happen
in
the
common
course
of
events.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
instead
of
that,
there
had
been
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
supposed
instead
of
that,
there
had
been
evidence
that
this
was
--
this
stop
was
a
very
severe,
very
extraordinary
and
that
he
had
never
known
it
to
happen
in
case
of
--
of
--
unless
there
was
something
wrong
with
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
make
a
difference
in
your
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i'm
saying.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
unless
--
not
unless
there's
evidence,
if
there
is
evidence
that
the
degree
of
violence
does
make
a
difference
(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
asked
you,
if
it
doesn't
happen.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
there's
no
such
evidence
as
to
(voice

justice

was
that
deposition
in
evidence?

was
the
deposition

evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
read
it,
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
can't
consider
the
deposition?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
was
no
objection
to
this

that
you
just
