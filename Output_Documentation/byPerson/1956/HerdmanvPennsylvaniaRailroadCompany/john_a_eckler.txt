mr.
john
a.
eckler
may
it
please
this
honorable
court.
the
issue
before
your
honor
is
a
simply
one
of
the
plaintiff
that
has
established
prima
facie
case,
so
well
the
district
judge
and
unanimous
circuit
of
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
directing
a
verdict
for
defendant
in
this
case.
the
petition
in
this
case
was
filed
in
1951
based
on
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
now,
the
court
knows
that
federal
employers'
liability
act,
it
is
not
an
insurance
law.
it
is
not
a
workmen's
compensation
law.
there
is
liability
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
only
if
the
employer
is
negligent.
plaintiff
in
his
complaint
filed
in
1951
reflects
that
fact
and
it
has
three
specific
allegations
of
negligence
for
which
the
railroad
is
charged.
one
was
that
the
negligence
failed
to
supply
a
safe
place
to
work.
negligence
failed
to
operate
the
train,
making
an
emergency
stop
and
finally,
negligence
to
fail
to
warn
the
plaintiff
to
stop.
immediately
after
filing
the
complaint,
the
plaintiff
indulged
in
most
elaborate
discovery
procedures.
two
different
sets
of
involved
detail
and
regulatories
were
filed
to
which
sworn
answers
were
prepared
and
filed
to
the
court.
then,
the
deposition
was
taken
of
the
engineer,
the
fireman,
everyone
else
who
had
any
knowledge
of
this
particular
accident
taken
by
the
plaintiff
and
prepared
and
ready
for
trial.
and
yet,
when
the
plaintiff
came
on
to
establish
his
case,
to
establish
these
allegations
of
negligence,
only
the
testimony
of
the
petitioner
or
plaintiff,
mr.
herdman
was
introduced.
the
detailed
depositions
were
not
used.
the
detailed
interrogatories
were
not
used
along
with
the
testimony
of
mr.
herdman.
a
large
portions
of
the
record
before
your
honors
seemed
to
us
to
be
totally
irrelevant
to
the
issues
in
this
case.
more
than
that,
some
of
--
some
of
the
assertions
of
fact
that
i
have
just
heard
my
judgment
are
completely
a
departure
from
those
of
the
record
and
i
should
like
to
review
the
facts.
their
facts
show
that
mr.
herdman
had
been
a
conductor
for
the
defendant
railroad.
as
such
conductor,
he
was
in
charge
of
the
train,
responsible
for
its
general
movements.
it
was
his
--
it
was
his
responsibility
to
report
all
incidents
in
the
operation
of
the
train.
on
february
1st,
1951,
mr.
herdman
was
the
conductor
of
a
regular
scheduled
train
running
from
richmond,
indiana
to
columbus,
ohio.
the
--
it
was
a
very
cold
day,
an
icy
day,
a
slippery
day,
snow
moved
through
the
air.
mr.
herdman
was
discharging
his
functions
as
a
conductor
riding
in
the
caboose
of
the
train.
the
train
had
proceeded
into
the
city
of
dayton
on
the
mainline
of
the
railroad.
it
was
going
through
a
closely
build
up
section
at
a
speed
of
some
eight
to
10
miles
an
hour.
as
the
train
approached
at
great
crossing
on
the
main
streets
of
the
city
of
dayton,
it
went
to
an
emergency
breaking
situation.
mr.
herdman
testifies
that
it's
a
result
of
the
brake
that
he
was
thrown
about
in
the
caboose.
incidentally,
a
fellow
trainman
who
was
riding
with
him
was
not
called
to
testify
as
to
what
actually
happened
at
the
time
of
the
stop.
the
question
of
mr.
herdman's
injuries
are
not
before
the
court.
although
plaintiff
took
the
liberty
in
its
brief
to
suggest
that
mr.
herdman
was
seriously
injured
indicated
here
today
that
he
hadn't
work.
i
think
it's
only
fair
that
we
suggest
to
your
honors
that
we
categorically
deny
that
mr.
herdman
was
in
fact
seriously
injured.
but
even
as
it
may,
as
soon
as
the
emergency
stop
was
made,
mr.
herdman,
as
it
was
his
responsibility
jumped
off
the
caboose
and
started
forward
to
determine
why
the
emergency
stop.
after
he'd
gone
past
the
couple
of
cars,
he
heard
the
air
coming
back
in
the
system.
he
turned
around
and
jumped
back
on
the
caboose
and
testified
that
he
had
first
looked
at
the
--
the
air
pressure
shortly
before
the
accident
and
then
the
air
pressure
came
back.
it
was
normal
at
the
exhaust
so
he
knew
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
the
equipment
that
something
had
gone
on,
on
the
front
end.
shortly
after
the
air
pressure
came
on
the
train
left,
went
three
more
miles
and
the
main
line
of
the
railroad
departed
and
went
into
a
switching
yard.
as
soon
as
it
has
gone
the
switching
yard
to
let
some
cars
off
and
pick
up
some
cars,
again
mr.
herdman
went
forward
and
talked
to
the
engineer.
the
engineer
told
him
that
the
reason
he
had
made
the
emergency
stop
was
because
an
automobile
of
--
appeared
to
be
school
children
at
3
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
had
come
up
to
the
crossing,
stopped,
slid
over
and
became
stopped
directly
on
the
railroad
tracks
and
that
for
that
reason
he
threw
the
car,
the
train
into
emergency.
mr.
herdman
then
when
they
arrived
in
columbus
about
midnight
made
a
report
of
this
particular
incident
and
mr.
herdman
the
next
day
filed
a
written
report
with
the
railroad
as
it
was
his
duty
to
report.
now,
that
has
been
discussed
and
i
want
to
again
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
report
was
marked
for
identification
purposes
as
defendant's
exhibit
a.
it
was
shown
to
mr.
herdman
on
the
stand.
mr.
herdman
himself
undertook
to
read
that
report
and
did
read
the
report
into
evidence.
and
then,
mr.
mcnamara
said,
“we
are
willing
mr.
barton
to
read
it,
if
the
court
please,
if
the
witness
can't
make
it
up,”
and
then,
mr.
barton
read
the
report
with
the
witness
following
the
report
and
that
report
is
then
this
was
filed,
mr.
herdman
immediately
after
the
accident,
"cn
28,
engine
8800
and
5680
moving
east
through
dayton,
with
67
cars,
at
estimated
speed
of
eight
to
10
miles
per
hour.
automobile
drove
over
crossing
just
east
of
dayton
rubber
works.
to
prevent
striking
the
automobile,
engineman
applied
air
in
emergency
causing
rough
stop.
i
was
standing
in
the
cabin
observing
air
gauge
and
when
stop
was
made,
knocked
me
to
the
floor
of
cabin
bruising
my
hip."
now,
if
it
please
the
court,
there
has
been
no
objection.
there
was
not
one
objection
to
this
report,
the
official
report,
the
report
made
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business
by
mr.
herdman
to
the
railroad.
there
was
no
objection
to
that
report.
they
introduced
and
is
a
part
of
this
case
in
chief
and
is
a
part
of
this
record.
immediately
thereafter,
mr.
barton
asked
mr.
herdman
about
it
and
he
said,
“now,
is
the
fact
the
way
the
accident
happened,
the
way
the
statement
--
that
statement
says”
and
mr.
herdman
said,
"the
engineer
told
me
that
was
the
way
he
did
it."
but
again,
there
has
been
no
objection.
the
first
objection
that
was
made
to
any
of
this
testimony
was
on
a
third
repetition
of
a
portion
of
it
and
mr.
mcnamara
then
said,
"i
object
on
the
grounds
of
hearsay
and
improper
cross-examination."
that
objection
was
overruled
and
mr.
herdman
has
not
taken
an
appeal
even
at
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
or
to
this
court.
mr.
justice
black,
it
is
true
that
where
evidence
which
is
hearsay
of
this
is
introduced
and
is
before
the
court
in
the
record,
it
is
entitled
to
its
full
formative
value.
but
more
than
that,
gentlemen,
this
evidence
was
not
hearsay
evidence.
if
it
was
hearsay,
it
was
entitled
to
admission
under
the
res
gestae
exception.
but
more
than
that,
the
actual
statement,
the
actual
report
is
admissible
under
the
ohio
statutes
for
a
regular
--
records
made
in
the
record
course
of
business
which
under
your
rule
--
federal
rule
20
something
--
43
(a)
is
entitled
to
admission.
so,
there
was
no
basis
to
keep
this
evidence
out.
it
was
proper
evidence
and
it
is
in
record
before
this
court.
it
supplies
the
answer
to
why
this
emergency
stop
was
made
and
inference
of
negligence
is
drawn
only
at
the
completion
of
the
entire
plaintiff's
case.
it's
then
you
say
from
the
facts
which
the
plaintiff
has
approved,
it
is
their
inference
of
negligence.
an
inference
never
was
created
in
this
case.
there
was
no
overcoming
an
inference.
there
was
no
rebutting
an
inference.
there
was
no
--
the
court
setting
itself
in
--
in
place
of
the
jury.
an
inference
never
arose
because
the
plaintiff
himself
in
his
own
case
established
at
the
conclusion
of
his
case
the
reason
for
the
emergency
stop
which
was
a
non-negligence
stop.
now
then,
this
question
of
is
an
emergency
stop
a
--
an
unusual
thing.
in
that
regard
and
i
want
to
be
accurate
and
i'll
try
to
follow
my
notes
regarding
the
emergency
stop.
the
plaintiff
testified
in
this
record
that
a
railroad
had
to
expect
emergency
stops,
page
37.
that
he
had
to
think
about
them.
the
record
shows
on
the
deposition
just
a
few
days
before
trial
that
the
plaintiff
told
me
that
he
himself
personally
had
experienced
while
riding
in
a
caboose
many
times
when
there
was
an
emergency
stop.
his
particular
testimony
at
that
is
as
follows.
i
said,
“have
you
ever
been
in
a
caboose
before
when
there
was
an
emergency
application
of
steam?"
he
says,
"many
times."
"was
there
anything
different
about
this
time?"
“emergency
of
air
you
mean?
i
have
said
emergency
of
steam
and
air?”
and
i
said,
“yes.”
and
he
said
“many
times.
i've
seen
the
tracks
jump
out.”
and
i
say,
“and
you
have
had
that
happen
to
you
many
times?”
“i
am
very
much
alert
to
expecting
that.”
now
this
was
his
--
his
deposition
a
week
before
the
trial.
mr.
john
a.
eckler
pardon?
mr.
john
a.
eckler
well,
what
--
mr.
john
a.
eckler
your
honor,
you
--
you
grant
that
this
is
hypothetical
because
there's
nothing
suggested.
mr.
john
a.
eckler
but
i
would
say
no,
no,
sir.
no,
sir,
and
if
it
was
--
it
was
very
violent
based
on
the
emergency
of
children
sliding
on
--
in
front
of
the
train,
the
engineer
putting
an
emergency
stop,
if
by
chance
for
some
mechanical
reason
happened
to
be
very
severe.
unfortunately,
mr.
herdman
had
no
claim
of
action
since
it's
based
on
the
negligence
of
the
railroad.
unfortunately,
we
don't
have
workmen's
compensation
law
to
compensate
men
in
this
regard.
the
men
themselves
don't
seem
to
want
it
but
--
but
i
would
answer
your
question
categorically
that
the
degree
of
violence
of
the
stop
makes
no
difference
and
--
and
where
he's
confronted
with
an
emergency
--
mr.
john
a.
eckler
well,
well
--
oh
yes,
yes.
mr.
john
a.
eckler
yes.
now
--
mr.
john
a.
eckler
correct.
there
was
no
such
evidence
at
all.
there
--
there
is
a
statement
and
that
there
were
two
questions
asked
to
mr.
herdman.
“is
there
any
other
way
to
stop
the
train?”
he
says,
“by
service
application.”
“what
does
that
mean?”
“well,
that
gradually
let's
off
the
air,
but
that's
all.”
there's
no
statement
that
confront
with
emergency
with
a
150
feet
of
track
ahead
of
you
and
a
carload
of
school
children
on
the
car
that
an
emergency
application
can
be
used.
there's
no
evidence
to
support
any
that
there's
any
other
means.
in
fact,
emergency
is
emergency
as
mr.
herdman
says
that
he's
experienced
it
many
times
that
he
knew
of
it
for
many
times.
he
says
that
the
conductor
himself,
he
has
a
conductor
riding
that
can
pull
emergency
stop
for
instance
if
i
had
the
reason
or
if
it
was
necessary.
“i
can
pull
the
air,”
he
said.
now,
this
is
in
the
regular
operation
of
a
railroad
that
an
emergency
stop
can
be
made
by
the
conductor.
anyone
on
the
statement,
the
regular
operation
of
a
freight
train
and
this
is
testimony
that
the
engineman,
the
engineer
can
make
emergency
stops
for
a
variety
of
reasons,
if
the
trail
line
brakes
at
air
plus
or
if
the
engineer
is
faced
with
an
emergency,
which
is
precisely
the
situation
here
that
it
is
an
expected
thing
of
railroading
--
railroading
men
must
experience.
he
says
that
emergency
stops
are
common
knowledge,
something
we
have
to
know
about.
and
then
he
concluded,
“you've
got
to
expect
them.”
so,
this
was
an
act
that
happens
in
the
ordinary
course
of
railroading
that
happens
without
the
explanation
of
negligence
or
inference
of
negligence.
now,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
is
the
total
proof
in
this
record
to
establish
the
three
specific
allegations
of
negligence.
mr.
john
a.
eckler
well,
of
course
you
see
the
--
the
record
is
silent
at
that
point.
this
issue
had
not
been
raised
in
this
record
and
--
and
in
the
deposition,
the
engineer
which
the
plaintiff
have
taken,
they
testified
that
by
putting
an
emergency
stop,
they
can
practically
knock
the
paint
off
of
the
automobile
and
the
train
didn't
stop
for
some
400
feet
on
the
other
side
of
the
crossing.
now,
this
of
course
under
your
discovery
procedures,
the
plaintiff
knew.
they
knew
that
only
by
the
emergency
that
was
a
close
miss,
a
near
miss
as
it
was.
well,
this
evidence
wasn't
introduced
but
the
record
that
he
built
here
has
no
evidence
at
all.
he
talks
about
an
emergency,
that
the
emergency
is
the
device
that
an
engineer
uses
to
stop
a
train
when
confronted
with
emergency.
at
3
o'clock
was
there
blowing
on
the
school
children.
he
came,
he
--
he
threw
an
emergency
operation
which
mr.
herdman
says,
“we
expect
many
times.”
there
is
no
foundation
in
this
record
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
depositions,
he
knew
none
could
be
made,
no
matter
what
kind
of
testimony.
no
experts
or
otherwise
could
support
the
proposition
that
there
was
any
other
means
of
stopping
this
particular
locomotive
at
this
time
that
it
was
the
proper
device,
the
only
device
and
it
was
a
very
fortunate
device.
it
was
a
matter
of
--
of
children
just
might
have
been
killed.
mr.
john
a.
eckler
well,
thank
--
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
now,
confronted
with
this
total
failure
of
proof,
plaintiff
made
a
motion
for
a
directed
verdict
at
the
end
of
plaintiff's
case
and
that
was
argued
by
the
trial
court.
the
court
held
in
our
favor
and
granted
the
motion.
an
appeal
was
made
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
briefs
were
filed
and
it
was
unanimously
determined
to
be
the
district
court's
duty
to
have
directed
our
verdict.
now,
the
two
of
the
three
specifications
of
negligence,
negligence
take
place
over
negligence
of
operation,
failure
to
warn.
the
plaintiff
abandoned
the
first
and
third
in
the
trial
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
we
understand
this
case
here
that
they're
abandoned.
he's
talking
not
only
about
the
negligent
operation
of
the
train
which
we
suggest
to
your
honors
has
been
totally
the
fruit
for
which
has
been
a
total
failure.
confronted
by
this
failure
and
the
plaintiff
knew
he
could
not
establish
any
negligence
nor
could
he
establish
any
of
the
three
--
these
three
allegations
of
negligence.
the
plaintiff
in
1954,
the
complaint
was
filed
in
1951,
in
1954,
late
in
the
afternoon
of
the
day
before
this
case
came
to
trial,
he
filed
a
minute
complaint.
and
at
that
time,
asserted
language
which
he
thought
might
lay
a
foundation
for
this
res
ipsa
loquitur
argument.
it
was
100%
a
johnny-come-lately
idea
by
this
--
by
the
plaintiff
after
he
knew
he
had
no
case
to
establish
negligence
against
the
railroad.
now,
this
document
is
res
ipsa
loquitur.
the
doctrine
appears
to
be
a
substitute
for
the
requirements
on
the
part
of
a
plaintiff
to
establish
by
clear
and
convincing
proof
the
--
his
case.
and
because
of
that
fact,
this
court
and
many
courts,
many
tax
writers
have
given
considerable
attention
to
the
question
of
res
ipsa
loquitur
to
still
down
the
various
propositions
seem
to
require
this.
the
various
discussions
of
very
res
ipsa
loquitur
seem
to
require
that
before
you
can
use
res
ipsa
loquitur
in
the
case,
each
of
four
basic
conditions
must
be
met.
first
that
the
actual
cause,
the
events
complained
of
is
not
in
evidence.
two,
that
the
plaintiff
does
not
have
knowledge
of
how
the
occurrence
happened.
three,
that
the
accident
is
one
which
does
not
happened
in
the
ordinary
course
of
events
unless
they
are
failure
to
use
due
care
and
four,
that
the
instrumentality
causing
the
injury
must
be
in
the
exclusive
control
of
the
defendant.
now,
not
only
does
the
plaintiff's
case
failed
to
satisfy
all
four
of
these
conditions,
in
truth,
it
failed
to
satisfy
any
one
of
the
conditions.
this
first
one
regarding
the
first
condition
that
the
actual
cause
of
the
events
complained
of
is
not
in
evidence.
now,
this
has
been
stated
in
different
ways
and
different
cases.
in
johnson
against
united
states,
333,
justice
douglas,
you
made
the
statement
that
the
rule
deals
only
with
permissible
inferences
from
unexplained
events.
and
justice
frankfurter,
you
said,
“it
is
after
all
a
rule
of
necessity
to
be
invoked
only
when
necessary
evidence
is
absent
and
not
readily
available.”
now,
i
submit
to
this
course
--
court
that
in
this
particular
case,
the
actual
cause
of
the
event
complained
of,
namely,
the
emergency
stop
is
in
evidence.
there
is
no
question
about
it.
it
is
in
evidence
in
this
record.
it
explains
why
the
stop
was
made,
namely,
the
emergency
stop.
the
doctrine
of
res
ipsa
loquitur
as
i
suggested,
is
a
fact
in
which
permits
an
inference
from
proven
facts,
but
it
is
an
inference.
it
is
a
doctrine
which
applies
only
at
the
completion
of
the
whole
case.
it's
at
the
end
of
the
plaintiff's
case
that
you
say
is
there
an
inference
of
negligence.
and
at
the
completion
of
this
plaintiff's
case,
not
at
his
testimony
in
chief
but
at
all
of
his
testimony,
the
question
asked,
“can
an
inference
be
drawn
of
negligence
at
this
time?”
and
in
the
record
that's
before
your
honor,
you
can't
read
the
record
without
knowing
the
reason
for
the
emergency
stop
that
there
was
no
negligence.
therefore,
there
could
be
no
permissible
inference
and
the
case
or
there
was
a
properly
a
directed
verdict.
now,
i
have
talked
about
this
word
of
--
word
about
the
proof.
recall
that
it
was
this
plaintiff's
duty
to
--
to
determine
the
cause
of
the
stop.
seconds
after
the
stop,
he
started
out
this
charge
of
that
duty.
three
miles
down
the
line,
he
did
determined
and
he
did
file
a
report.
that
report
is
in
evidence.
the
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
suggested
that
mr.
barton
read
the
--
the
report
and
it
was
marked
for
identification
purposes
as
our
exhibit
and
is
in
reference
here.
i
have
discussed
the
question
of
the
--
the
--
that
this
evidence
is
relevant
even
if
there
had
been
objection,
there
was
no
objection.
one
objection
was
made
to
only
one
statement
and
no
appeal
has
been
taken
from
that
and
the
--
the
general
testimony
regarding
the
stop
is
in
evidence
without
any
objection.
and
i
will
repeat
again
the
plaintiff's
suggestion
that
the
--
the
question
you've
asked,
mr.
chief
justice,
about
the
stop
not
being
necessary,
i
repeat
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
you
might
ask.
he
also
said,
“well
--
well,
could
you
stop
a
train
by
just
letting
off
the
(inaudible)
cause
to
stop
of
course
you
could.”
everyone
knows
there's
a
service
application,
but
there's
no
evidence
that
in
the
facts
confronting
the
engineer
and
fireman
here,
automobile
on
the
tracks
that
a
service
application
could
have
done
the
job.
there
was
no
jury
question
presented,
no
testimony
which
would
support
it.
the
plaintiff
himself
said
that
the
use
of
emergency
stop
in
emergency
situations
and
--
and
on
that
point,
i
think
the
court
might
be
interested
in
the
testimony
of
mr.
herdman,
statements
of
mr.
herdman
which
answered
the
res
--
just
that
question
and
--
and
answer
this
question
that
again
this
is
his
statement,
a
little
salt
here,
made
no
lawyers
off
this
track
to
the
courtroom
and
here
is
mr.
herdman's
deposition
when
he
has
stated
that
he
had
talked
to
the
engineer,
the
question
was,
“what
did
he
tell
you?”
mr.
herdsman's
answer
-
"he
told
me
when
i
got
off,
he
had
a
pickup,
he
set
off
and
whatnot."
that
was,
he
had
some
cars
to
change
after
been
going
down
three
miles
from
the
stop.
and
i
asked
him,
"what
in
the
hell
was
he
trying
to
do
back
there?
are
you
trying
to
kill
us
in
the
caboose?"
he
said,
"no,
virg,"
he
said,
"i
didn't
give
it
a
thought."
i
had
--
there
was
a
carload
of
school
children,
some
kids
in
the
car.
he
felt
they
might
be
school
children
who
are
going
home
or
whatnot.
and
he
said,
“they
skidded
out
on
the
tracks
and
stopped,"
and
he
said,
"my
god,
it
was
you,
to
get
you
back
there,
take
a
chance
on
you
or
kill
them
kids."
and
he
said,
“that
was
the
reason
he
done
it.”
now,
i
suggest
that
with
any
test
of
hearsay
and
i
suggest
within
any
question
confronted
with
this
emergency,
this
firemen
and
engineer
did
the
one
thing
he
could
do,
was
stop
this
train.
certainly,
that
doesn't
imply
negligence,
in
the
inference
of
negligence
which
supports
the
claim
under
the
fela.
the
next
part
that
i
have
lost
track
of
my
time
but
i
--
i
think
i
can
keep
track
of
it.
the
second
condition
which
must
be
shown
is
that
the
plaintiff
does
not
have
knowledge
of
the
event.
this
again
has
been
stated
in
many
ways.
what
in
here
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
plaintiff
did
know,
plaintiff
not
only
testified
as
to
the
report
that
he
made.
he
testified
in
detail
as
to
the
validity
of
the
report.
mr.
john
a.
eckler
pardon?
mr.
john
a.
eckler
no,
deposition
was
not
in
evidence.
mr.
john
a.
eckler
pardon?
i
--
i
read
this
one
portion
which
is
--
which
is
the
same
testimony.
i
said
this
was
a
little
more
colorful,
a
little
salt
here,
of
his
testimony
and
of
the
--
the
statements.
he
makes
the
same
statements
in
--
in
the
record
that
he
was
told
and
he
was
asked
about
that
particular
point
on
page
--
mr.
john
a.
eckler
no,
no,
your
honor.
that's
right.
and
of
course,
it's
on
page
23
in
the
record
that
says,
“as
a
matter
of
fact
mr.
herdman
in
the
deposition
mr.
eckler
took
from
you
three
days
ago.
you
told
him
that
the
engineer
told
you
that
there
was
a
load
of
school
children
in
an
automobile
and
he
stopped
to
avoid
striking
the
automobile,
didn't
he?”
and
his
answer
is,
"the
engineer
told
me
that".
now,
it
was
that
particular
testimony
that
--
that
i
called
the
court's
attention
--
mr.
john
a.
eckler
no,
sir.
mr.
john
a.
eckler
well,
yes.
at
one
portion
--
at
one
portion
he
said
--
mr.
john
a.
eckler
yes,
mr.
mcnamara
said
“objection,”
but
there
was
no
ruling
and
he
didn't
press
the
objection.
there's
no
question
now
in
this
case.
now,
i
should
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
of
the
knowledge
which
the
corporate
defendant
had
of
this
instance.
it
was
only
the
knowledge
it
got
from
the
plaintiff
himself
since
the
plaintiff
was
the
one
charged
with
responsibility
of
making
this
report.
he
was
the
conductor,
and
it
was
his
report
to
the
defendant
that
gave
a
defendant
any
knowledge,
the
only
knowledge
it
had.
an
honest
question
of
the
plaintiff
does
not
have
knowledge
of
the
event.
i
should
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
and
i
have
not
seen
this
discussed
in
any
case,
but
this
is
a
fundamental
requirement,
they
suggested
through
and
through
that
the
plaintiff
does
not
have
knowledge.
yet,
while
that
may
have
had
validity
back
in
1860
when
the
case
was
--
the
doctrine
was
first
given
a
name,
a
barrel
falling
out
of
a
head
in
the
english
case
and
hitting
the
man,
the
head
and
so
forth.
now,
since
the
court
has
approved
and
adopted
federal
rules
of
procedure
for
discovery,
there
is
a
real
question
with
the
--
there's
any
validity
any
longer
and
this
question
of
plaintiff
does
not
have
knowledge
of
the
event.
and
in
this
particular
case
as
the
record
shows
detailed
interrogatories
were
taken.
depositions
were
taken.
the
plaintiff
knew
not
only
from
the
actual
facts
but
from
the
discovered
procedure
of
the
defendant.
the
third
condition,
which
must
be
shown
the
res
ipsa
loquitur
apply
is
that
the
accident
is
one
which
does
not
happen
in
the
ordinary
course
of
events
unless
there
is
a
failure
to
use
due
care.
now,
here
again,
the
plaintiff's
proof
failed
and
when
i
discussed
the
fact,
i've
called
your
attention
that
the
testimony
here
by
the
plaintiff
was
that
many
times
he
had
experienced
stops,
emergency
stops
and
--
and
that
the
engineer
himself
has
to
use
the
emergency
stops
when
faced
--
faced
with
such
an
--
such
situations.
i
call
the
court's
attention,
the
statement
of
circuit
court
of
appeals
judge
boldt
in
another
case
in
which
he
said,
“it
is
common
knowledge
that
trainmen
--
among
trainmen,
that
air
brakes
are
applied
in
emergency,
not
frequently
yet
--
but
yet
commonly
enough
to
be
an
incident
of
freight
train
operation.
trainmen
must
expect
the
occasional
necessity
for
such
applications.
when
they
are
made
in
order
to
protect
life,
it
is
the
performance
of
a
duty.”
and
i
submit
that
that's
exactly
what
we
have
in
this
case.
the
engineer
stopped
the
train
to
protect
life.
it
was
a
--
a
performance
of
the
duty.
and
finally,
if
it
please
the
court,
the
fourth
grounds
for
proving
a
res
ipsa
loquitur
must
be
shown
is
that
the
instrumentality
be
in
the
control
of
the
defendant.
but
the
instrumentality
here
was
an
automobile
sliding
out
in
front
of
the
train
and
striking
the
similar
effect
that
was
presented
in
smith
against
the
(inaudible)
in
which
this
court
denies
certiorari
in
346.
their
train
was
involved
by
a
tractor
trailer
at
a
great
crossing,
and
the
plaintiff's
fireman
was
killed.
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
the
doctrine
of
res
ipsa
loquitur
has
no
application
to
the
facts
in
this
case
for
the
reason
that
the
tractor
trailer
which
collided
with
the
locomotive
was
not
under
the
control
of
the
appellee,
just
as
the
automobile
was
not
here.
now,
i
would
like
to
say
to
the
court
that
there
is
no
confusion
in
this
record
as
to
where
this
accident
took
place.
this
accident
happened
on
a
regular
schedule
run
from
richmond
to
columbus
as
the
train
came
in
riding
through
dayton,
ohio
in
a
closely
built
up
residential
section
as
an
automobile
drove
out,
come
to,
and
in
front
of
this
train.
now,
the
counsel
for
plaintiff
suggested
in
his
argument,
he
suggest
that
every
page
in
his
brief
or
reply
brief
that
this
happened
within
the
limits
of
the
dayton
yards.
there
is
that
statement,
but
plaintiff
knows
that
the
dayton
yards
is
an
administrative
decision
for
a
maintenance
section
on
the
railroad.
the
fact
show
that
this
was
on
the
mainline,
that
this
was
not
a
switching
yard
situation.
this
was
not
a
classification
yard
situation
where
the
railroad
controls
the
whole
area.
and
if
it
has
to
make
an
emergency
stop
because
someone
got
on
the
tracks
then
it
is
their
own
fault.
here,
it
was
at
a
great
crossing
and
the
train
on
the
mainline,
so
they
have
no
control
over
this
particular
great
crossing.
finally,
i
suggest
that
because
the
--
not
only
has
the
plaintiff
not
shown
all
four
conditions
they
must
show,
he
has
not
been
able
to
show
any
one
of
the
four
that
this
was
not
a
proper
case
for
res
ipsa
loquitur.
i
also
would
like
to
suggest
the
court
that
there
is
no
conflict
in
the
district
in
the
disregard.
just
this
past
month,
this
court
in
number
361,
(inaudible)
against
northwestern
refused
certiorari
in
a
case
in
their
own
county
where
the
court
had
granted
a
directed
verdict
in
an
fela
case
at
the
completion
of
the
plaintiff's
case.
the
various
circuits
have
required
these
four
basic
conditions
and
plaintiff
is
not
satisfied.
and
therefore,
we
suggest
it
and
--
and
probably
even
more
important
is
that
there
never
was
and
in
our
judgment
never
will
be
another
herdman
case.
you
can't
disassociate
a
res
ipsa
loquitur
case
from
the
facts
to
the
particular
case.
and
in
this
case,
we
have
a
conductor
charged
with
responsibility
and
finds
out
and
goes
in
the
record
the
cause
of
the
accident
certainly
there
is
no
conflict
with
any
of
the
decision.
finally,
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
the
fela
is
not
a
workmen's
compensation
law.
now,
there
have
been
numerous
members
of
this
bench
that
have
suggested
it
might
be
well
for
congress
to
--
to
pass
the
workmen's
compensation
law
for
railroad.
with
that
proposition,
we
certainly
do
not
have
--
deny
or
question
or
disagree
what
congress
does.
the
fela
remains
an
act
based
entirely
on
negligence
and
negligence
must
be
shown
is
not
presumed
and
was
not
shown
in
this
case.
and
finally,
and
i
have
just
lived
through
the
shortest
30
minutes
of
my
life.
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
that
on
page
number
--
on
point
number
three
of
our
brief,
we
call
the
attention
to
the
sound,
the
judicial
discretion
which
should
properly
be
accorded
trial
judges.
and
i
would
like
to
suggest
the
court
in
the
trial
of
these
cases,
we
have
found
occasionally
when
a
motion
for
directed
verdict
is
made
that
the
trial
judge
is
implying
to
reserve
his
opinion
and
let
their
defendant
put
in
his
case
and
then
when
it's
renewed
he
again
reserves
his
opinion
and
judgment
on
the
motion
until
the
matter
has
been
submitted
to
the
jury.
we
often
suspect
that
maybe
it
is
designed
to
--
to
hope
that
the
jury
might
protect
the
judge
and
require
to
make
the
--
it's
his
decision.
i
would
like
to
say
that
it
is
refreshing
indeed
to
see
the
evidence
of
a
really
courageous,
straightforward,
direct
piece
of
judicial
statements
here
and
a
court
approved
