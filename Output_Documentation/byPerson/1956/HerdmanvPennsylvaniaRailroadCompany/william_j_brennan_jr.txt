j.
brennan,

well,
was
it
--
rather
the
other
way
whether
or
not
a
sudden
stop,
if
it
occurs
ordinarily
will
not
occur
unless
someone
failed
to
use
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
--
what
is
the
ordinary
experience?
don't
trains
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
don't
they
stop
suddenly?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
and
if
that's
case
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know,
but
do
you
rely
to
the
res
ipsa
just
on
the
record
or
was
it
the
matter
of
ordinary
human
experience
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
was
drawn
in?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
see,
you
mean
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
mere
--
the
mere
fact
that
it's
ordinary
human
experience
that
when
a
train
stops
suddenly,
it
wouldn't
do
so
unless
someone
fail
to
use
due
care
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
ordinary
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
don't
think
elevators
fall
very
often
fortunately,
do
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
the
train
--
the
train
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
trains
do
stop
suddenly
quite
a
bit,
don't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
but
don't
they
--
in
your
own
experience?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
don't
you
think
there's
a
difference
between
a
scheduled
stop
where
as
you've
phrased
it,
"it's
made
roughly?”
and
a
--
and
a
sudden
stop
at
the
time
as
we
have
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i'm
speaking
in
terms
of
--
if
it's
a
scheduled
stop,
ordinarily,
you
would
expect
it
to
be
smoothly
made,
that's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
ordinarily
the
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
when
you
have
a
sudden
stop
en
route
not
at
a
scheduled
point
ordinarily
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
fact
that
you
make
it
does
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
it
be
made
--
do
you
think
it's
made
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
has
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that's
the
question,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
should
you
think
you
have
read
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
mr.
mcnamara?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
bottom
of
that
page
over
on
36,
says,
“i've
known
it
but
many
times.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
known
whether
that
was
an
emergency
application,
i
know
about
many
emergency
applications
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
applied
to
the
other
fellows
that
i
wasn't
involved.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
we
get
the
same
inference
then?
