chief

earl

mr.
eckler,
there
is
just
one
thing
in
there
that
that
bothered
me
and
it's
this.
you
said
that
the
severity
of
the
--
of
the
shock
wouldn't
make
any
difference
in
a
situation
of
this
kind?
i
was
wondering
if
it
--
if
it
would
say
--
say
the
train
was
going
35,
40,
50
miles
an
hour
and
an
automobile
came
across
the
crossing
and
they
applied
the
--
applied
the
brakes
very
quickly
as
an
emergency,
why
of
course
it
would
--
it
would
throw
you
from
one
end
of
the
car
to
the
other.
but
on
the
other
hand,
if
you're
going
very
slowly,
the
application
of
the
air
brakes
even
in
slight
manner
not
as
an
emergency
but
even
in
a
just
--
just
throttling
it
down
would
--
would
slow
you
down
with
practically
no
--
no
shock
at
all.
now,
i
notice
in
this
--
in
this
statement
that
the
train
was
going
eight
to
ten
miles
an
hour.
it
took
eight
miles
an
hour.
it's
just
about
a
dog
track
and
if
--
if
the
brakes
are
in
condition,
i
thought
i
read
here
a
moment
ago
that
he
said
they
were
in
condition.
at
eight
miles
an
hour,
you
--
you
wouldn't
think
that
it
would
take
a
terrific
shock
that
way
and
if
it
--
if
one
would
think
that
way,
maybe
--
maybe
it's
sure
he
would
have
the
right
to
--
to
determine
whether
it
was
--
had
anything
to
do
with
the
safe
place
to
work.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
proceed,
proceed
to
--
we're
going
to
finish
the
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
you
have
one
minute,
mr.

warren
