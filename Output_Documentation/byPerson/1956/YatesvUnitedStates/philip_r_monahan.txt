mr.
philip
r.
monahan
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
arose
as
to
the
relationship
between
these
petitioners,
and
the
senate
petitioners.
while
i
believe
that
relationship
will
come
out
in
more
detail
a
little
later,
i
think
i
can
recapitulate
all
of
the
evidence
in
one
sentence
by
saying
that
the
dennis
defendants
with
a
full
star
and
the
five
star
generals,
and
these
petitioners
were
the
lieutenant
generals
and
the
major
generals,
with
brigadier
of
two.
but
they
are
all
in
the
same
army,
and
they
were
all
engaged
in
the
same
mission.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
would
--
i
would
differ
mr.
margolis
in
a
couple
of
respect.
one
of
the
petitioners
whom
he
represents,
petitioner
lima,
has
been
a
member
of
the
national
committee.
another
one,
petitioner
yates,
has
been
an
ultimate
member.
do
you
want
me
to
take
the
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
--
the
petitioners
that
mr.
margolis
does
not
represent,
there
are
three
that
he
does
not
represent.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
all
of
them?
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i'm
on
it
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
wanted
--
i
should
really
qualify
what
i
said
a
minute
ago.
there
is
one
exception,
petitioner
schneiderman
i
think
is
a
four
star
general
at
least
in
any
man's
language.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
just
thought
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
petitioner
schneiderman
is
or
has
been
--
i
don't
know
what
he
is
now,
but
at
the
time
of
the
trial
or
sometime
shortly
before
them,
a
member
of
the
national
committee
of
the
communist
party.
and
also
a
member
of
the
inner
group,
known
as
the
national
board,
in
addition
of
course
to
being,
for
some
15
or
20
years,
the
leader
of
the
party
in
california.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
he
is
the
national
--
i
mean
the
state
chairman
in
california,
in
addition
to
those
national
officers
that
i
have
mentioned.
petitioner
yates,
as
i
have
mentioned,
has
been
an
ultimate
member
of
national
committee.
and
is
or
has
been
until
recently,
the
organizational
secretary,
which
is
the
number
two
office,
the
second
in
command
right
under
schneiderman.
petitioner
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
state
officer.
petitioner
stack
formally
occupied
the
position
which
petitioner
yates
occupied
now
namely,
the
organizational
secretary
of
the
communist
party
in
california,
the
number
two
official
of
california.
lima,
as
i
mentioned,
was
formally
a
member
of
the
national
committee,
and
is
or
has
been
a
member
of
the
california
state
committee.
lambert
is
a
member
of
the
california
state
committee
and
holds
the
very
or
has
held
the
--
until
recently,
the
very
important
position
of
the
state
security
head.
he
is
the
man,
he
is
--
i
might
say
the
(inaudible)
of
the
communist
party.
he
is
the
man
whose
duty
it
is
to
find
out
what
they
refer
to
as
stool
pigeons
in
the
party
and
get
rid
of
them.
petitioner
carlson
was
one
time
the
organizer
of
the
wisconsin
communist
party.
and
is
or
has
been
until
recently,
the
organizer
of
the
los
angeles
county
of
the
communist
party.
he
was
shifted
suddenly
on
orders
from
the
national
committee,
he
left
california,
went
to
wisconsin
for
a
few
years
to
give
the
party
a
shot
in
the
arm
as
one
of
the
witnesses
testified.
and
then
suddenly
was
transferred
back
to
california.
as
happened
with
so
many
of
these
persons
who
i
believe,
most
or
all
or
most
whom
are
classified
as
professional
revolutionists,
which
i
will
define
a
little
bit
later
on
from
their
--
from
party
sources.
petitioner
dorothy
healey
connelly
whom
incidentally
i
shall
refer
to
by
her
maiden
name
healey,
to
distinguish
her
from
phillip
connelly
and
because
she
was
referred
to
by
the
name
healey
throughout
the
trial,
he
is
or
has
been
until
recently,
the
county
chairman
of
los
angeles
county.
petitioner
dobbs
is
or
has
been
until
recently,
the
organizational
secretary,
that
is
to
say
the
number
two
official
of
the
communist
party
of
los
angeles.
petitioner
steinberg
is
or
has
been
until
recently
the
educational
director,
that
highly
important
job
of
organizing
the
study
groups
for
the
los
angeles
county.
petitioner
spector
is
or
has
been
the
division
organizer
of
the
southern
division
of
los
angeles
county.
i
should
explain
that
the
division
is
the
next
level
below
the
county.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
think
slightly
more
important
than
a
precinct,
sir.
in
fact
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
there
are
two
lower
levels
in
the
division,
there's
the
section
and
there
are
clubs.
petitioner
kusnitz
is
or
has
been
the
division
organizational
secretary
of
the
midtown
division
of
los
angeles
county.
in
other
words,
at
the
same
level
as
spector,
except
he
was
second
command
of
the
third
division.
petitioner
fox
is
or
has
been
the
leader,
the
chairman
of
the
highly
important
san
francisco
maritime
section.
richmond
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
no,
he's
--
he
is
the
head
of
the
maritime
section
in
san
francisco
county.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
--
the
section
is
below
the
division.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
now,
i
speak
generally,
there
--
there
are
some
counties
in
which
there
are
no
divisions.
the
division
is
an
intermediate
level
between
the
county
and
the
section
for
certain
counties
only,
the
more
populous
counties.
richmond
is
the
editor
in
chief
of
the
west
coast
communist
paper.
the
paper
that
corresponds
the
daily
worker
except
it's
the
west
coast,
named,
the
daily
people's
world.
and
petitioner
connelly
is
the
los
angeles
editor
of
the
people's
world.
that
covers
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well,
if
i
were
to
pursue
my
figure
sir,
i
would
say
that
a
newly
--
a
newly
inducted
member
would
be
a
private.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
just
a
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
just
--
would
he
be
--
would
he
be
an
officer?
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it
would
depend
upon
the
evidence,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
but
--
but
briefly,
there
--
there'd
be
the
club
--
there's
a
club
in
the
section.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
if
the
court
please.
our
response
channels
itself
into
four
principal
points,
the
four
points
which
have
been
discussed
by
the
petitioner's
counsel.
the
first
point
we
will
take
up
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
15
separate
refusals,
the
part
of
the
petitioner
file
testifying
constituted,
but
one
single
contempt.
secondly,
we
would
discuss
the
question
for
our
contention
that
even
--
even
if
this
court
should
hold
that
the
15
refusals
were
but
a
single
continuous
contempt
that
the
district
court
still
had
the
power
to
coerce
compliance
by
incarceration
of
the
witness
during
the
trial
and
to
punish
the
petitioner
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial.
third,
i
will
try
to
discuss
very
briefly,
the
petitioner's
contention
that
the
trial
court
in
sentencing
the
petitioner
for
one
year
was
merely
trying
to
coerce
answers
and
was
not
trying
to
vindicate
the
authority
of
the
court.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
that
was
--
you
mean
that
at
the
same
time
that
he
puts
her
into
jail
to
coerce,
he
can
also
--
that's
to
impose
a
fine
for
criminal
contempt?
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it
is
our
contention,
your
honor,
that
the
same
contempt,
the
same
disobedience
of
a
court's
lawful
order
can
be
punished
in
two
ways.
one,
for
the
equitable
power
of
the
court
to
coerce
compliance
with
courts
orders
which
maybe
through
imprisonment
and
secondly,
through
the
courts
power
to
punish
and
thereby
to
vindicate
the
authority
of
the
court.
i
think
that's
this
court's
holding
to
the
mine
workers
case.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
about
that
in
this
case.
well,
we
--
we
don't
have
to,
your
honor,
except
that
they
raised
the
point
that
these
contempts
were
part
of
one
continuous
transaction
and
really
only
one
contempt.
we
have
an
alternative
argument.
first,
that
they
were
not
a
single
contempt,
that
they
were
at
the
very
minimum,
six
contempts
breaking
it
down
to
the
persons,
subject
matters
of
the
various
inquiries.
and
this
second
alternative
contention
that
we
raised
is
that
even
if
the
court
should
adopt
their
argument
that
it's
so
--
that
the
15
questions
were
so
integrally
related
to
constitute
but
--
but
one
continuous
offense
that
the
court
had
the
dual
authority
here
to
coerce
and
to
punish.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
no,
sir.
but
if
--
but
if
this
court
adopts
their
theory,
then
the
11
would
merge
or
--
or
be
their
detailed
on
the
four
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
sir?
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well,
that's
the
way
the
district
court
regarded
them
and
that's
the
way
the
circuit
court
regarded
them
but
the
petitioners
would
like
this
court
to
regard
them
both
as
the
same
case
for
this
purpose.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
court
of
appeals
did
not.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
nor
did
the
district
court
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
--
could
not
do
that.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
my
position
is
an
agreement
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
a
--
a
court
could
not
do
that
because
of
the
due
process
consideration.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
that
i
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
but
why
did
the
court
gives
her
a
fair
warning
at
the
time
he
puts
her
in
jail
for
the
--
for
the
coercive
purpose
that
she
also
faces
a
criminal
charge
for
contempt
to
court.
in
other
words,
so
that
the,
the
contemnor
would
not
be
deluded,
so
to
speak,
into
thinking
that
his
incarceration
during
the
trial
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
--
was
all
the
punishment
that
he
was
going
to
get.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well,
because
i
don't
think
that
she
did,
your
honor,
because
there
were
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
no,
sir
because
if
it
is
true,
it
was
not
completed
until
the
third
day
when
she
refused
to
answer
the
11
questions
which
were
added
to
the
four
on
the
first
day.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
but
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
court
of
appeals
treated
the
first
four
contempts
as
something
apart,
something
separate.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir
but
even
if
i
assume
that
they
all
constituted
but
one
contempt,
i
will
not
concede
that
the
contempt
was
complete
on
the
first
day.
and
therefore,
the
rationale
of
the
court
of
appeals
would
be
different
from
the
rationale
that
i
would
place
upon
a
continuous
contempt
which
placed
over
a
period
of
three
days.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
she
was
in
jail
because
she
was
in
contempt
of
court.
and
it
is
our
--
it's
our
position,
that
she
--
she
committed
additional
contempts
three
days
later.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
on
the
first
day,
he
did
not
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
that's
right.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
except
that
the
petitioners
argue
that
the
substantive
--
substantive
questions
were
a
continuing
part
of
the
contempt
and
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well
i
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
if
the
court
please,
i
don't
admit
at
all.
i
don't
concede
at
all
that
there
was
only
one
contempt
here,
it
is
merely
an
alternative
argument
which
was
the
petitioners
made.
now
first,
their
argument
is
that
the
15
refusals
were
one
that
the
contempt
was
total
on
june
26
when
she
stated
her
position
that
she
would
refuse
to
identify
persons
as
communist.
and
they
say
that
the
government
could
not
thereafter
the
multiply
of
the
contempt
because
of
her
having
taken
that
fixed
position.
and
they
try
to
bring
the
case
within
the
rationale
of
such
cases
as
costello
where
there
was
a
total
refusal
and
the
court
held,
the
court
of
appeals
held
and
where
a
witness
has
refused
to
answer
of
any
questions
at
all,
you
cannot
continue
to
ask
different
questions
and
multiply
the
contempts.
now,
we
contend
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
--
i
agree
that
where
a
witness
said
that
i
just
won't
testify
at
all
and
by
continuing
to
ask
questions
on
the
same
subject
matter,
it
would
not
add
to
the
one
contempt.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
contempt
--
the
contempt
your
honor
is
the
refusal
to
testify
at
all,
the
same
as
refusal
to
appear
in
response
to
a
subpoena
it
would
be
but
one
contempt.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
because
he
has
--
he
has
said
i
won't
answer
any
other
--
any
questions
at
all,
so
that
--
so
that
any
question
that
are
subsequently
put
would
certainly
come
within
his
first
refusal
and
would
be
a
merely
and
when
he
then
refused,
he
would
be
merely
restating
the
position
that
he
had
previously
announced.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well,
i
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
that's
the
holding
in
costello.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it
could
be,
your
honor.
but
here,
it
is
our
contention
that
that
was
not
the
position
that
the
petitioner
here
took.
she
did
not
take
the
position
that
i
won't
tell
you
any
names
of
people
in
the
communist
party.
he
took
the
position
which
amounted
to
--
to
this.
if
you
ask
me
a
question
about
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
i
will
decide
when
that
question
is
put
whether
or
not
i
will
answer
that
question.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
she
--
she
said
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
have
a
sort
of
synopsis
of
that
statement
your
honor.
the
first
time,
i
can't
support
it
to
go
through
the
--
the
various
statements
that
she
did
make
in
making
her
refusal
from
these
various
days.
in
the
morning
session
of
june
26,
the
first
day
of
the
first
court
contempt,
the
petitioner
testified
concerning
a
co-defendant
frank
carlson.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
that's
in
transcript
11,231.
i
don't
think
it's
in
the
record,
your
honor.
transcript
11,231,
she
said
that
in
the
19
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
sir?
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
it's
set
forth
in
the
statement
of
facts,
i
think
it's
on
page
7
(inaudible).
now,
at
that
time,
she
did
testify
as
to
co-defendant
(inaudible)
identified
him
as
the
party's
california
state
chairman.
and
she
also
testified
as
to
having
frequently
met
with
her
co-defendant
frank
carlson
at
the
communist
party
office
during
the
year
of
about
1951.
now,
she
was
then
asked
who
else
did
you
meet
with
that
communist
party
headquarters.
she
made
this
statement,
says
she
would
not
answer,
that
she
was
not
willing
to
do
anything
that's
going
to
harm
the
defense
of
other
people.
and
she
was
not
willing
to
do
anything
that
is
going
to
open
up
the
door
of
persecution
and
harassment
of
other
people.
the
prosecutor
denied
the
press
for
an
answer
on
that
question.
in
the
afternoon
session
of
june
26,
she
was
asked
concerning
a
harry
glickson
who
had
appeared
prominent
in
the
government's
case
in
chief,
and
who
the
evidence
show
we
think
conclusively
as
a
co-conspirator.
the
petitioner
had
testified
on
direct
examination
as
to
a
statement
which
was
attributed
to
glickson
by
a
government
witness,
and
she
had
in
fact
said
that
that
statement
attributed
to
glickson
would
not
have
been
made
by
a
good
communist,
that
a
person
with
a
proper
understanding
of
marxism-leninism
and
good
communist
party
leader
would
not
make
such
a
statement.
it
was
a
statement
which
concerned
itself
with
the
fact
that
the
communist
party
was
readying
itself
for
a
revolution.
i
could
quote
it
but
the
statement
of
her
counsel
in
cross-examining
her
and
something
up
as
to
that
statement
is
set
forth
at
page

transcript.
now,
when
she
was
asked
this
question
as
to
glickson
and
the
question
also
as
to
a
co-defendant
who
digressed,
frank
spector.
she
took
the
position
that
the
questions
as
to
glickson
could
lead
to
a
situation
in
which
a
person
could
be
caused
or
suffer
the
loss
of
his
job
and
be
subjected
to
further
harassment
in
a
period
such
as
this
where
there
is
so
much
witch-hunting
and
hysteria.
and
the
question
as
to
her
co-defendant
frank
spector,
she
took
the
position
that
she
would
not
become
a
government
informant,
she
put.
now,
so
her
refusals
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
that's
right
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
that's
right
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
on
that
first
day,
on
her
two
refusals,
one
in
the
morning
and
one
in
the
afternoon,
it's
a
general
refusal.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
she
took
substantially
the
same
position
and
that's
it.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
now,
on
the
third
day,
of
her
cross-examination,
when
she
was
asked
this
or
prior
to
her
being
asked
these
11
questions,
she
was
interrogated
--
or
first,
let
me
say
that
she
did
testify
as
to
certain
people
who
had
been
or
were
members
and
officials
of
the
communist
party.
she
testified
for
his
annual
freely
concerning
william
z.foster,
the
national
chairman
of
the
communist
party
and
it
might
be
noted
as
the
trial
court
pointed
out
during
the
course
of
hearings
in
this
matter
that
william
z.foster
at
that
time
was
under
indictment
and
was
on
trial
for
conspiracy
to
violate
the
smith
act.
yet,
he
had
no
compulsion
in
identifying
william
z.
foster
as
an
official
--
high
--
the
top
official
of
the
communist
party.
she
also
identified
one
mike
queen
as
a
person
she
knew
to
be
a
communist
party
member.
but
the
explanation
that
she
knew
that
mike
queen
was
dead
and
her
testimony
could
not
hurt
him.
she
also
testified
as
to
a
(inaudible)
whom
she
identified
as
a
person
she
knew
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
now,
she
was
then
asked
concerning
meetings
that
had
been
held
in
a
home
of
a
government
witness
(inaudible)
state
board
in
the
year
1947
to
1948
in
san
francisco.
and
she
was
asked
who
attended
the
meetings
and
she
said
that
she
will
refuse
to
state
who
any
of
the
persons
were
and
she
admitted
the
home
of
mrs.
(inaudible)
because
these
people
are
in
a
position
where
my
identification
of
them
as
communist
would
do
them
an
estimable
amount
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
she's
applying
one
of
her
earlier
grounds
to
these
people.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
she
said
they
were
in
that
category.
she
determined
subjectively
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well,
no
sir.
that
isn't
involved
here
because
she
does
not
held
in
contempt
for
refusing
to
divulge
the
names
of
the
people
who
were
there.
the
court
did
not
instruct
her
to
answer
that
particular
question.
i
don't
believe.
at
least
it
is
not
--
it
is
not
a
specification
of
contempt.
she
was
not
held
on
contempt
for
her
refusal
to
divulge
or
to
answer
the
question
as
to
who
was
there.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
think
--
i
think
one
or
two
of
the
subsequent
names
as
to
the
specific
questions,
leading
questions,
were
people
who
had
attended
this
meetings.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
of
course
that
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
sir?
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
no
sir.
we
don't
think
the
position
that
you
can
ask,
did
you
know
frank
spector
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
that
tomorrow
on
the
same
cross-examination
asked
the
identical
same
question,
did
you
know
frank
spector
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party?
that
is
our
position.
that
is
not
involved
because
what
--
what
we
have
here
is
a
series
of
15
questions
involving
10
people.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
that
those
questions
are
pertinent
to
the
cross-examination
that
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well,
we
don't
have
to
meet
that
either
because,
we
don't
--
we
didn't
have
presented
that
kind
of
a
problem.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir,
they
refer
--
they
refer
to
co-defendants,
some
co-defendants
who
had
rested
their
case.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
at
the
conclusion
of
the
government's
case
10
of
the
14
co-defendants
arrested.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
don't
think
she
covered
all
of
her
co-defendants
who
had
rested
in
that
answer.
but
these
questions
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir,
very
broad.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
or
at
least
i
have
been
unable
to
find
any
case
in
which
this
court
has
ruled
on
that
specific
problem.
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
second
circuit
in
the
costello
case
did
make
such
a
finding.
however,
i
think
that
the
refusal
of
the
witness
to
answer
at
all
or
to
respond
to
a
subpoena
is
a
different
situation
than
you
have
here
where
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
chooses
to
waive
her
absolute
privilege
not
to
testify
and
gets
on
the
stand
and
thereafter
seeks
to
pick
and
choose
the
questions
that
she
will
or
will
not
answer.
here,
it
was
a
situation
where
this
petitioner
got
on
to
stand
and
testify
to
--
to
whatever
she
thought
might
be
beneficial
to
her
case.
and
the
questions
which
concerned
themselves
with
her
associations
with
co-conspirators,
her
associations
with
people
who
the
government's
evident
show
or
teachers
in
the
communist
party,
she
then
refused
to
testify,
and
on
the
clumsy
ground
that
i
won't
be
a
government
informer.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well
sir,
i
was
merely
stating
the
rule
of
the
costello
case
which
is
the
rule
which
the
petitioner
seek
to
put
themselves
within.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well,
i
wouldn't
like
to
wait
for
the
crime
if
the
court
please
and
i
think
both
of
them
amount
to
a
total
disregard
for
the
processes
that
are
duly
set
out
to
compel
testimony.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
think
that
this
woman
should
--
should
be
susceptible
to
punishment
for
each
one
of
the
individual
refusals
to
comply
with
the
court's
directive.
and
the
--
the
rationale
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
costello
case,
that
was
a
contempt
of
congress
case,
and
a
contempt
of
court
case,
was
that
the
witness
had
committed
his
contempt.it
was
the
same
as
if
a
witness
did
not
even
answer
a
subpoena.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
a
more
serious
thing
for
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case,
to
--
to
take
a
stand
and
to
waive
his
privilege
and
to
testify
as
to
certain
matters
that
she
thinks
maybe
helpful
to
him.
and
then,
on
cross-examination
which
might
hurt
to
call
a
cross-examiner.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
think
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
plus
not
only
that
--
not
on
the
fact
that
they
were
different
subjects
of
inquiries
that
you
could
use
to
answer
but
here
you
had
one
day
when
she
refused
to
answer
more
questions,
and
the
later
day,
three
days
later
when
she
refused
to
answer
a
series
of
11
questions.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
certainly
your
honor,
precisely.
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
some
significance
that
on
the
first
day
of
her
--
before
her
refusal
going
to
discussion
of
the
contempt
action,
the
cross-examiners
stated
that
he
did
not
intend
to
go
into
any
names
except
names
of
either
co-conspirators
named
in
the
indictment,
or
names
which
had
been
brought
out
by
various
witnesses
as
club
leaders
and
chairman
or
leaders
of
various
groups.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
--
i
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
our
point
here,
your
honor
that
he
was
cross-examined,
this
witness.
this
was
--
has
got
her
on
the
stand
and
she
made
a
general
denial
of
participating
in
this
conspiracy.
she
denied
that
she
conspired
with
anybody,
to
do
any
of
the
things
charged
for
this
indictment.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
no
sir,
she
did
not.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
that's
correct.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
say
that
--
if
the
court
please,
that
the
question
as
to
(inaudible)
summation
of
the
propriety,
and
the
necessity
of
the
cross-examination
on
this
point.
a
government
witness
had
testified
and
i'm
going
to
use
the
petitioner's
trial
counsel
who
has
summarized
it
in
questioning
her
concerning
her
testimony
in
regard
the
witness.
he
said,
in
direct
examination
of
this
petition,
i
will
ask
you
the
same
question
with
respect
to
the
testimony
of
the
witness
forward,
at
page
4440
of
the
transcript
to
the
effect
that
in
a
club
meeting
it
was
said
that
in
support
of
veterans'
legislation
was
important
because
it
would
analyze
the
case
of
national
crisis
such
as
revolt.
now
--
then
he
went
on
to
another
question
which
can
also
concern
itself
with
the
government
witnesses
statement
that
glickson
had
testified
concerning
to
revolt,
the
fact
that
revolt
will
eventually
break
out.
she
in
effect
said
by
her
answers
on
her
direct
examination
that
a
good
communist
just
wouldn't
make
such
a
statement
about
revolt.
now,
it
is
our
contention
that
the
cross-examiner
had
a
right
and
a
duty
to
inquire
her
--
did
she
know
this
harry
glickson
whose
words
--
she
was
forsaken.
did
--
how
long
have
she
known
him?
did
she
know
him
as
a
communist
party
leader
through
her
activities
and
associations
with
him,
had
she
continued
or
considered
him
over
the
years
as
a
good
communist
party
leader.
as
a
matter
of
cross-examination
of
her
denial
of
the
government's
evidence
as
to
what
glickson
had
thought
at
this
communist
party
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
no
sir,
he
was
not
a
defendant,
he
was
a
person
who
was
--
mentioned
many,
many
times
in
the
evidence
and
who
is
apparent
was
a
co-conspirator
with
the
defendants
in
this
case.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
he
was
not
a
witness.
glickson
was
not
a
witness.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
they
asked
three
questions
concerning
glickson
on
the
first
day.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
sir?
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
glickson
was
only
involved
in
the
questions
of
the
first
day.
this
was
on
cross-examination
after
she
had
testified
concerning
the
statement
attributed
to
glickson.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
that's
right.
and
we
submit
that
the
government
had
a
right
to
show
through
this
cross-examination
of
her
knowledge
over
glickson
and
previous
association
with
glickson
that
she
did
actually
consider
him
as
a
good
communist.
as
a
matter
of
cross-examination
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
he
was
gotten
into
as
a
third
party
declaration
of
a
co-conspirator
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
he
was
not
alleged
in
the
indictment
as
such
but
the
evidence
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
four
names
which
had
been
brought
up.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
no,
sir,
i
added
this.
four
names
which
had
been
brought
up
by
various
witnesses
as
12
leaders,
chairman
who
are
leaders
of
various
groups.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
people
already
in
evidence.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
and
people
who
the
evidence
showed
or
that
the
jury
could
conclude
from
the
evidence
were
co-conspirators
with
this
petitioner
who
was
testifying.
and
therefore,
the
three
questions
that
were
asked
were
any
time
since
she
was
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
have
you
ever
known
glickson
to
be
a
member
of
the
party.
the
next
one,
isn't
that
true
that
mr.
harry
glickson
was
going
to
use
44
and
46
--
45
and
46
and
act
as
chairman
of
a
communist
club
in
the
city
of
san
francisco?
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir
we
do.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
no
denial
except
for
her
statement.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
she
didn't
say
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
--
yes,
he
was
a
communist
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
if
the
court
please.
yesterday,
mr.
margolis
made
the
observation
that
the
communist
party
is
opposed
to
persons
who
want
and
advocate
socialism,
now,
right
away
and
that
they
insist
that
before
socialism
can
be
brought
to
this
country,
a
majority
must
be
convinced
of
the
desirability
of
it.
i
would
like
to
ask
mr.
margolis
in
replying
to
explain
a
majority
of
whom
and
secondly,
how
is
the
fact
of
this
majority
to
be
registered
or
to
be
made
known.
in
a
moment,
i
shall
proceed
to
state
the
government's
position
based
upon
the
evidence
in
this
case
as
to
what
the
communist
party
believes
and
teaches
in
respect
of
those
questions.
in
another
observation
that
he
made,
was
that
there
is
no
--
nothing
in
any
marxist
communist
classics
which
teaches
or
advocates
the
violent
overthrow
of
this
government,
the
government
of
the
united
states.
in
a
moment,
i
would
like
to
read
to
the
court
a
passage
or
two
which
does
so
advocate
and
--
so
i
shall
now
--
if
the
court
wishes
to
follow
the
--
the
reading
of
the
evidence,
it
appears
on
page
155
of
the
government's
brief.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
indictment
charges
the
petitioners
with
having
knowingly
joined
a
conspiracy.
to
advocate
and
teach
the
duty
and
a
necessity
of
violently
overthrowing
the
government
of
the
united
states
with
the
specific
intent
--
i
must
use
the
word
"intent".
i
don't
think
that
question
making
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
with
the
intent
of
accomplishing
that
desideratum
that
objective
as
soon
as
possible,
as
soon
as
circumstances
permit.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
to
advocate
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it
definitely
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
the
advocacy,
not
only
the
action
but
of
the
violent
action.

mr.
philip
r.
monahan
those
were
the
two
overt
acts
which
occurred
within
the
statute
of
limitations
period
and
which
were
approved.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
only
two
that
were
alleged
and
proved.
there
were
many
overt
acts
that
were
proved
but
which
were
not
laid
in
the
indictment.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
believe
that
under
the
statute,
it's
necessary
for
the
government
to
allege
and
prove
at
least
one
overt
act
committed
by
anyone
of
the
conspirators
within
the
statutory
period.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well,
of
course
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
nature
of
the
meeting
is
important.
i
mean
--
the
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
overt
--
i
mean,
it
is
permissible
for
the
government
to
prove
what
happened
to
these
meetings.
now,
the
government
does
not
say
that
there
was
overt
advocacy
of
violence
at
these
meetings,
these
were
public
meetings.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
they
were
public
meetings.
they
were
lenin
memorial
rallies
which
were
meetings
of
--
of
the
--
of
a
nature
in
which
communists
try
to
recruit
members
into
their
organization.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
they
were
--
the
one
thing
there
was
an
appeal
for
funds
to
foster
the
activities
of
the
communist
party.
there
was
speeches
and
prayers
of
lenin,
the
author
of
the
pirate
conspiracy
which
the
communist
in
this
country
and
the
world
over
seek
to
duplicate
at
the
earliest
opportunity.
and
lenin,
of
course,
too
is
the
author
of
most
of
the
so-called
marxist-leninist
classics
which
the
communist
used
as
a
vehicle,
the
chief
vehicle
for
their
indoctrination
of
their
members
and
their
advocacy
of
teaching
of
force
and
violence.
i
say,
he's
either
the
author
or
at
least
the
author's
purport
to
expound
his
teachings.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
certainly,
sir.
that's
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well
established
law.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
hundred
years
of
history.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it
must
--
it
must
be
of
such
a
nature
is
to
indicate
that
the
conspiracy
is
not
still
up
in
the
minds
of
the
conspirators
but
has
somehow
manifested
itself
objectively.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it
can
be
picking
up
a
telephone
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
--
making
a
phone
call
can
be
an
overt
act.
there
were
liberty
scores
of
cases
which
so
--
which
so
holds.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it
was
a
meeting
such
as
this,
sir,
which
the
communist
used
to
interest
the
people
in
their
conspiracy
--
in
their
organization
with
the
objective
of
getting
them
into
it
as
members
and
then
to
indoctrinate
them
and
build
up
their
organization.
now,
i
would
like
to,
first
continue
if
i
may
on
the
--
the
teaching
of
the
communist
party
which
is
contained
in
the
--
this
booklet
called
"outline
on
fundamentals
of
marxism
for
class
study
or
self
use"
issued
by
the
state
educational
committee
of
the
communist
party
of
california.
incidentally,
there
are
two
other
documents
substantially
identical,
one
issued
by
the
national
organization
and
one
by
the
los
angeles
county
organization.
now
on
page
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
would
say
this
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
would
say
that
one
of
the
--
if
not
the
principle
argument
of
the
petitioners
is
that
the
judge
in
his
instructions
to
the
jury
did
not
make
sufficiently
clear
that
it
was
a
violent
action
which
they
had
to
find
that
the
defendant
is
conspired
to
advocate,
and
not
just
abstract
approval
of
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
urging.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i'm
not
certain.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
six.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
a
large
part
of
which
may
i
observe,
your
honor,
was
devoted
to
thorough
exhaustive
and,
i
was
going
to
say
merciless
cross-examination
of
the
government
witnesses.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
mean
that
--
i'm
saying
that
that
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip

monahan
may

may
i
read
what
the
judge
told
the
jury
in
his
charge?
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i'd
like
to
develop
it
right
now,
sir.
on

--
i'm
going
to
read
from
the
instructions
as
they
are
contained
in
volume
106
of

supplement.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
in
the
--
in
the
record,
they
are
at

the
part
that
i
want
to
read,
sir?
mr.

--
mr.

the
--
the
part
that
i'm
going
to
read
sir
began
at
page
13,752
of
that
green
bound
record.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
word
"advocate"
means
to
urge
or
to
plead
in
favor
of
to
support,
vindicate
or
recommend
publicly.
the
word
"teach"
means
to
instruct,
show
how,
to
guide
the
studies
of.
the
word
"force"
means
the
use
of
physical
power
other
than
the
power
of
oral
or
written
speech.
the
word
"violence"
it
means
the
use
of
great
and
destructive
force.
the
holding
of
a
belief
or
opinion
does
not
constitute
advocacy
or
teaching.
hence,
the
smith
act
does
not
prohibit
persons
who
may
believe
that
the
violent
overthrow
and
destruction
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
is
probable
or
inevitable
from
expressing
that
belief,
whether
such
belief
be
reasonable
or
unreasonable
is
immaterial.
prediction
or
prophecy
is
not
advocacy.
any
advocacy
or
teaching
which
does
not
include
the
urging
of
force
and
violence
as
the
means
of
overthrowing
and
destroying
the
government
of
the
united
states
is
not
within
the
issue
of
the
indictment
here
and
can
constitute
no
basis
for
any
finding
against
the
defendants
etcetera.
there
was
further
instruction
in
that
same
thing
going
on
to
the
next
page.
i
think
that
the
jury,
were
clearly
instructed
that
the
defendants
were
not
being
charged
with
conspiring
to
inculcate
ideas,
but
that
they
were
charged
with
conspiring
to
advocate,
force
and
violence
as
a
means
of
overthrowing
the
government
of
this
united
states.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes.
yes,
sir.
in
judge
medina's
charge
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
in
judge
medina's
charge
he
used
--
he
used
the
word
"incite".
he
said,
"i
charge
you
that
in
order
to
convict,
you
must
find
that
the
defendants
advocated
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
in
language
ordinarily
and
reasonably
calculated
to
incite
to
such
action."
now,
at
this
trial,
the
question
arose
in
colloquy
as
to
the
propriety
of
the
word
"incite."
judge
mathes
pointed
out
that
incite
and
in
fact
the
defense
attorney's
not
only
pointed
out
but
insisted
that
"incite"
connoted
moving
to
action
immediately.
and
judge
mathes
said,
obviously
the
smith
act
doesn't
--
in
words
or
a
fact
he
said
the
smith
act
doesn't
--
isn't
concerned
with
that.
its
advocacy
of
force
and
violence
as
soon
as
possible,
as
soon
as
circumstances
permit
and
for
that
reason,
he
declined
to
use
the
word
"incite"
in
his
instructions
even
though
the
government
acquiesced
in.
in
fact
that
was
among
the
proposed
instructions
of
the
government
because
judge
medina
had
given
it
and
hasn't
given
in
other
cases.
the
essence
of
our
position
on
this
point,
sir,
is
that
the
word
"incite"
is
a
perfectly
proper
word
to
use
in
the
smith
act
instruction
if
it
is
understood
as
not
connoting
incitement
to
immediate
action
but
as
--
but
as
connoting
no
more
than
the
incitement
of
--
of
the
urging
of
action
at
some
time
when
the
signal
is
given,
when
the
catalyst
has
been
added
to
the
mixture.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it
was
perfectly
--
proper
charge
if
understood
in
the
way
that
i've
just
explained
to
mr.
justice
harlan,
sir.
but
the
issue
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
if
it
--
if
it
was
explained
as
--
as
meaning
"urge"
and
so
judge
mathes,
instead
of
using
the
word
"incite"
and
explaining
that
all
it
meant
is
"urge"
said
it
means
"urge".
i
mean
he
just
used
the
word
"urge."
and
that
is
the
essence
of
the
government's
positions
that
what
is
forbidden
is
the
urging
--
the
urging
of
force
and
violence
and
that
was
given.
now,
i'd
like
to
get
on
to
page
155
of
the
brief
and
i'm
going
to
read
excerpts
from
lesson
7
of
the
"outline
on
the
fundamentals
of
marxism."
lesson
7
defines
socialism
as
the
establishment
of
the
political
power
of
the
working
class.
the
foundation
of
soviet
power
achieved
through
revolution.
a
prerequisite
of
a
socialist
revolution
is
said
to
be
"support
of
the
class
conscious
workers
by
the
majority
of
the
people."
in
order
to
--
to
obtain
the
power
of
a
state,
the
outline
states
and
it
quotes
lenin
here,
"the
class
conscious
workers
must
win
the
majority
to
their
side."
we
are
not
linguists.
we
are
not
in
favor
of
seizure
or
power
by
a
minority
but
that
the
word
"majority"
referred
to
does
not
mean
an
absolute
majority
of
all
the
people
is
quickly
made
clear.
what
it
--
it
says
that
those
who
affect
the
seizure
of
power
should
have
the
sympathy
of
the
masses.
meaning
by
the
term
"masses",
the
majority
of
whom,
everybody
know
the
workers
and
of
the
exploited
ones.
now,
in
chapter
3,
part
3
of
stalin's
foundation
of
leninism
which
is
given
as
assigned
reading
in
this
lesson.
stalin's
quotes
a
statement
of
lenin's
as
follows.
it
follows,
"that
for
the
--
for
revolution
it
is
essential
first,
that
a
majority
of
the
workers"
or
at
least
the
majority
of
the
class
conscious,
the
thinking,
the
politically
active
workers)
should
fully
understand
the
necessity
for
revolution
and
what?
march
to
the
polls
and
voted
into
it
--
voted
in?
no.
be
ready
to
sacrifice
their
lives
for
it.
the
matter
has
given,
even
more
pointed
clarification
in
chapter
4
of
problems
of
leninism
which
is
given
as
additional
reading
in
this
lesson.
there,
stalin
again
quotes
lenin
with
--
refers
with
scorn
to
the
view
of
the
petty-bourgeois
democrats,
that
the
majority
of
the
population
must
first
declare
itself
for
the
party
of
proletariat.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
book?
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
of
the
book
that
--
was
1926
--
1924.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it
was,
sir.
i
--
i
believe
under
another
title.
i
think
it
was
called
the
"the
theory
and
practice
of
leninism."
must
first
declare
itself
for
the
party
of
the
proletarian
and
only
then
can
it
and
should
it
take
power."
that
says
stalin
and
he
still
quoting
lenin
is
what
it
said
by
--
and
this
language
was
italicized
and
mr.
stalin
indicates
that
it's
his
italics.
that
is
what
it
said
by
petty-bourgeois
democrats
who
call
themselves
socialist,
but
are
really
the
henchmen
of
the
bourgeoisie.
but
we
say,
and
stalin
again
indicates
that
this
is
his
italics."
let
the
revolutionary
proletariat
first
overthrow
the
bourgeoisie,
break
the
yoke
of
capital,
breakup
the
bourgeois
state
apparatus."
then
the
victorious
proletariat
will
speedily
gave
them
sympathy
and
support
of
the
majority
of
toiling
non-proletarian
masses
by
satisfying
their
wants
at
the
expense
of
the
exploiters.
having
overthrown
the
bourgeoisie
and
seized
state
power,
the
same
chapter
continues,
the
--
the
proletariat
must
introduce
soviet
rule
and
smash
to
pieces
the
oral
state
apparatus.
and
if
it
could
be
any
further
doubt
about
what
is
meant,
it
is
removed
by
lenin's
reply
to
those
who
confuse
the
dictatorship
of
the
proletariat
with
popular
or
elected
government
which
stalin
quotes
with
approval
in
the
same
chapter."
the
class
which
has
seized
political
power"
said
lenin
does
not
decieved
themselves
or
others
by
talk
about
popular
elected
government's,
sanctified
by
the
whole
people."
"for
the
scientific
concept
of
dictatorship"
he
said,
"means
nothing
more
or
less
than
unlimited
power
resting
on
violence
and
not
on
law."
and
i
don't
want
to
--
there's
one
more
passage
on
this
general
point,
i'd
like
to
develop.
on
--
in
lesson
eight,
the
following
lesson,
chapter
two
of
the
same
book
is
referred
to
as
given
as
assigned
reading.
and
in
that
chapter,
stalin,
again
hit
scorn
and
ridicule
on
the
opportunist
who
assert
that
the
proletariat
cannot
and
not
enough
to
take
power
unless
it
constitutes
a
majority
in
the
country."
no
proofs
are
reduced"
he
says,
"for
there
are
no
proofs
either
theoretical
or
practical
that
can
justify
this
absurd
thesis.
i
can't
think
of
any
stronger
language
to
make
it
clear
that
the
communist
in
this
country
think
that
it
is
ridiculous
that
they're
going
to
take
power
by
a
--
by
majority
vote.
and
it's
true
that
this
book
is
written
in
1924,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
but
the
communist
party
--
we're
not
selecting
these
passages,
the
communist
party
is
selecting
these
passages,
it
is
outlined
some
fundamentals.
we're
just
reading
the
passages
that
the
communist
party
selects
for
their
study
outlines.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well
i
just
want
to
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
--
remove
any
possible
inference
that
this
is
a
--
that
this
is
some
old
dusty
tome.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
see.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well,
the
argument
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
think
the
--
the
counsel
for
the
other
side,
someone
of
them
has
referred
to
these
books
as
being
old
ancient
dusty
tomes
that
refer
to
some
other
country
and
some
other
part
of
the
world
and
some
other
time.
it's
true
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
not
only
bad
but
it
can
be
revitalized
by
being
reused
in
present
times
in
this
country.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
they
give
assigned
reading.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
after
--
after
they
give
the
outline
of
their
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
this
--
this
study
--
this
--
these
study
groups
were
going
on
throughout
the
state
of
california
in
the
post
world
war
ii
period
and
they
were
put
out
by
the
state
--
by
the
national
committee,
and
a
state
committee
and
the
various
county
committees
on
which
some
of
the
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
--
on
which
some
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
there
is
no
specific
evidence
saying
that
a
certain
person,
certain
defendant
individually
and
personally
put
this
on
the
hands
of
anyone
but
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
may
i
refer
your
honor
to
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
may
i
say
this
sir,
that
two
of
these
petitioners
authored
one
of
the
study
outlines
except
that
it
was
not
the
study
outlines
that
were
used
in
the
immediate
post
war
--
world
war
ii
period
but
were
used
in
the
1949
to
1950
after
the
schneiderman
--
i
mean
after
the
dennis
indictment
was
brought.
and
that
contains
certain
language
such
as
the
--
refers
to
the
attempt
of
the
bourgeoisie
to
pin
advocacy
of
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
on
them
etcetera.
but
the
same
books
are
referred
to,
the
same
classics
are
referred
to,
the
same
passages
are
referred
to.
and
as
the
defendants
are
referred
to,
our
petitioner,
schneiderman
and
yates,
and
i'm
coming
to
that
in
a
moment,
sir.
now,
about
the
--
there
being
no
classic
that
advocates
the
violent
overthrow
of
this
government.
may
i
refer
the
court
to
page
153
of
the
government's
brief,
where
in
lesson
4
which
assigns
chapter
4
of
stalin's
foundations
of
leninism.
it
has
stated
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
page
153
of
the
government's
brief.
stalin's
further
points
out
in
this
chapter
that
while
marx
did
at
one
time
concede
the
possibility
of
a
peaceful
--
"peaceful
evolution
of
bourgeois
democracy
into
proletarian
democracy
in
england
and
america,"
that
concession
no
longer
his
validity.
now,
"the
special
conditions
for
peaceful
development
in
england
and
united
states
have
disappeared
so
that
marxist
qualification
in
regard
to
these
countries
can
no
longer
hold
good.
hence,
at
present
in
england
and
united
states
no
less
than
other
imperialist
countries
of
the
world,
the
law
of
violent
proletarian
revolution,
the
law
of
the
smashing
of
the
bourgeois
state
machine
as
a
preliminary
condition
for
such
revolution
is
in
inevitable
law."
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it
is
said
in
words
or
affect,
"i
urge
you."
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
that
would
not
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
that
would
not
suffice.
there
has
to
be
an
urging
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
--
an
urging
of
violent
action.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.

the

that
from

so

by

teaching
the
duty
and
necessity
of
overthrowing

with
the

of

by

and

as

as

and
by
two,
willfully
and
knowingly

helping
to

of
persons
who
teach

advocate
the
overthrow
and
destruction
of

government
of

by
force
and
violence
with
the
same
intent.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
judges
charged
and
didn't
leave
any
doubt
about
that.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
and
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
doubt
in
the
indictment
either
but
the
important
thing
is
that
the
charge
didn't
leave
any
in
doubt.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
as
i
understood
mr.
justice
black's
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
word
"advocate"
was
used.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
but
--
but
the
judge
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well,
that's
--
that's
the
word
that's
in
the
--
was
in
the
indictment
that
was
--
that
--
that
was
--
that's
the
word
was
in
the
smith
act
which
was
sustained
by
this
court
in
the
dennis
case.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
and
there
was
here
too.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
but
that
instruction
that
was
given
by
judge
medina
in
which
the
government
acquiesced
in
was
the
same
substantial
instruction
that
was
given
by
judge
mathes
in
this
case.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
there
is
nothing
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
--
there
is
nothing
sacrosanct
about
the
phraseology
of
an
instruction,
if
the
idea
--
if
the
idea
of
the
instruction
is
conveyed
in
other
language,
it's
perfectly
appropriate.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
and
i
think
it's
clear
from
all
of
the
prevailing
opinions
of
this
court
in
the
dennis
case
that
that
other
language
does
mean
this.
there
is
not
a
single
intimation
in
any
of
the
prevailing
opinions
of
this
court.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes.
and
i
think
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
--
i
want
to
point
out
that
--
that
he
was
correct
because
that
is
what
this
court
decided
in
the
dennis
case
as
it's
clear
from
the
prevailing
opinions.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i'll
just
come
back
to
the
point
i
made
a
moment
ago,
sir.
there's
nothing
sacrosanct
about
the
word
"incite"
it's
the
idea.
it's
the
proper
idea
which
is
conveyed
by
the
word
"incite",
which
is
important
and
it
is
that
idea
which
judge
mathes
conveyed.
now,
as
i
understood
justice
--
mr.
justice
black's
point.
he
said
if
someone
takes
lenin's
state
in
revolution
and
hands
it
to
someone
and
says,
"read
this."
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
you
got
to
have
more
than
intent
and
there
was
more
than
intent
here.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
there
has
to
be
advocacy
of
violent
action,
the
urging.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
he
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
he
doesn't
have
to
use
any
particular
language.
he
doesn't
have
to
say,
"i
urged
you
to
overthrow
the
government
of
the
united
states
at
your
earliest
opportunity."
he
doesn't
have
to
use
language
like
that.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
and
suppose
he
picks
up,
passed
and
read
this
and
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
and
he
says
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
and
i
urge
you
to
do
it
like
manner.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
he
would
have
to
make
that
--
he
would
have
to
make
that
point
clear
in
a
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
--
in
words
or
effect.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i'd
like
to
get
into
it
right
now.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
remember
this
--
this
is
the
charge
in
the
conspiracy.
there
is
no
necessity
that
any
individual
member
of
the
conspiracy,
himself
in
his
--
out
of
his
own
lips
say
this,
as
long
as
he
is
knowing
member
of
the
conspiracy
to
do
this
and
--
now,
i
would
like
to
get
into
the
evidence.
you
heard
yesterday
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
case.
i'd
like
to
give
you
some
of
the
evidence.
i
like
to
start
out
with
mr.
william
schneiderman,
the
man
who
has
gone
soft
in
communism.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
no.
i've
--
it
--
it
begins
on
page
58
of
the
government's
brief.
he
--
he
was
introduced
on
the
floor
of
the
california
state
convention
in
1945
by
steve
nelson
as
a
professional
communist
who
has
given
his
whole
life
to
the
communist
party.
i
believe
that
as
this
evidence
unfolds,
the
court
will
agree
that
mr.
nelson's
characterization
is
entirely
justified.
at
his
denaturalization
hearing
in
1939
in
the
case
which
reached
this
court,
mr.
schneiderman
was
asked
and
he
gave
the
following
answers,
asked
the
following
questions
and
gave
the
following
answers.
"where
did
you
go
then
in
1934?"
"i
made
a
visit
to
europe
and
i
made
a
visit
to
the
soviet
union."
"that
was
in
1934?"
"yes."
"did
you
go
as
an
official
representative
of
the
communist
party
for
the
united
states
of
america?"
"no."
did
you
go
with
the
delegate
to
some
congress
of
the
communist
international?"
i
went
there
on
a
visit
and
i
stayed
there,
and
studied
conditions."
"you
were
not
a
delegate
to
the
communist
international?"
"during
the
time
i
was
there,
the
seventh
world
congress
of
the
communist
international
took
place
and
i
attended
that.
i
remember
when
i
read
that
in
1943,
when
this
case
was
before
the
court,
i
had
the
impression
of
a
tourist,
dropping
in
congress
to
watch
proceedings."
"but
you
were
not
a
delegate
to
it?"
now,
mr.
honig,
a
witness
in
this
case
gave
sharply
differing
testimonies
about
mr.
schneiderman's
activities
in
moscow
in
1934.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
he
was
--
he
was
a
witness
in
his
denaturalization.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
cross-examination
on
mr.
schneiderman
in
this
case.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
because
there
was
no
direct
testimony.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
mr.
honig
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
all
of
it.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it
was
introduced,
i
believe,
by
petitioner
yates
who
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
believe
that
the
--
that
the
introduction
of
it
was
at
the
request
of
petitioner
yates
who
said
that
she
--
she
agreed
with
schneiderman's
testimony
in
that
case.
now,
"mr.
honig,
what
other
countries
have
delegates
there
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
this
is
page
335
of
this
yellow
covered
appendix
to
the
government's
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
335.
yes,
sir.
i
should
say
that
honig
testified
that
schneiderman
not
only
was
a
delegate
of
the
american
communist
party
to
the
seventh
world
congress
of
the
communist
international
in
1934
and
1935.
but
he
was
the
--
the
only
delegate."
mr.
honig,
what
other
countries
have
delegates
there
at
the
red
international
labor
unions?"
i
should
explain
that
mr.
honig
testified
about
two
meetings.
one,
the
meeting
of
the
red
international
of
labor
unions
at
which
schneiderman
was
present
and
other
one,
later
in
that
week,
of
the
communist
international
at
which
mr.
schneiderman
was
present.
mr.
honig
is
not
testifying
about
the
--
the
meeting
at
the
red
event
--
at
the
red
international
of
labor
unions."
let's
take
the
meeting
at
the
building
of
the
red
international
of
labor
unions
about
when
do
that
take
place."
"there
were
a
number
of
such
meetings
but
i
could
mention
one,
specific
one
at
which
the
policy
of
the
communist
party
was
discussed.
and
that
one
was
in
the
second
week
after
my
arrival.
i
would
place
that
in
the
middle
of
june
1934."
"how
many
people
are
present
to
that
meeting?"
"about
25."
"25
people
present
at
this
meeting."
"was
the
defendant
schneiderman
present?"
"he
was
that
one."
"did
he
participate
in
the
discussion?"
"yes."
"will
you
relate
as
nearly
as
you
can
recall
what
was
said
with
respect
to
the
policy
of
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states?"
"the
court."
"and
--
and
who
said
it?"
"the
witness."
"well,
the
policy
of
the
party
of
the
united
states
of
the
american
party
was
discussed
first
of
all,
in
relationship
to
a
situation
in
the
san
francisco
waterfront.
in
a
moment,
i'm
going
to
get
into
--
if
i
have
time,
i
want
to
say
a
few
words
about
the
san
francisco
waterfront.
some
of
the
justices,
they
recall
that
more
vividly
than
others
but
i'll
differ
that
for
the
moment.
a
man
named
lozovsky,
solomon
lozovsky
who
was
the
head
of
the
red
international
of
labor
unions,
introduced
the
subject
by
mentioning
that
he
got
a
report
from
the
american
communist
party
directly
by
mr.
kennison.
"mr.
honig,
will
you
go
ahead
and
tell
us
what
was
setup
in
the
meeting
and
who
said
it?"
answer,"well
this
man
lozovsky,
whom
i
mentioned,
introduced
the
question
of
the
american
party's
policy
towards
the
situation
on
the
waterfront
in
san
francisco.
he
said
that
he
received
a
letter
from
earl
browder
who
was
then
the
general
secretary
of
the
american
communist
party,
which
stated
that
the
longshoremen
were
either
on
strike
or
about
to
call
a
strike
that
the
strike
--
that
the
party
was
endeavoring
to
spread
this
into
a
general
strike
of
all
waterfront
employees
in
san
francisco.
and
lozovsky
mentioned,
that
browder
mentioned
what
the
american
policy
was
to
that
effect?
that
they
were
trying
to
spread
that
into
such
a
general
waterfront
strike.
then
lozovsky,
after
quoting
this
letter,
this
is
still
honig
testifying.
"as
i
recall,
he
did
not
read
the
entire
letter.
he
just
quoted
from
it.
he
said
that
he
thought
that
from
the
contents
of
the
letter
and
the
tenor
of
the
letter
that
perhaps
the
strike
could
be
further
spread
into
a
general
strike
of
all
workers
at
least
in
san
francisco,
not
merely
the
waterfront
workers.
and
he
threw
the
floor
open
to
--
to
discussion
on
the
subject
of
the
policy
for
the
american
party
to
pursue.
that
is
to
endeavor
to
bring
about
such
a
general
strike
of
all
the
workers
in
san
francisco.
i'm
not
giving
the
exact
words
because
i
don't
remember
them
but
that
was
about
what
he
says.
that
was
about
what
lozovsky
said.
then
he
called
upon
schneiderman
to
state
his
opinion
on
what
the
american
policy
should
be
or
could
be.
based
upon
what
he
had
suggested
himself
since
schneiderman
was
the
american
representative
to
the
common
term.
he
said,
he
felt
that
all
--
he
said,
he
felt
we
all
are
to
hear
from
him.
the
witness
giving
two
lines.
the
witness,schneiderman
said
that
he
thought
that
was
an
excellent
suggestion.
that
from
what
he
understood
and
from
what
he
heard
lozovsky
read,
are
quote
from
the
letter,
"he
thought
such
a
general
strike
could
be
produced."
then
many
other
people
took
the
floor
and
agreed
to
that.
lozovsky
again
took
the
floor.
i'm
not
giving
the
chronological
order
in
which
they
spoke.
he
reminded
the
people
there
with
the
basic
communist
party
policy
throughout
the
world
that
general
strike
should
be
regarded
as
rehearsals
for
seizure
of
power
by
the
party
and
the
working
class.
and
the
delegates
became
very
enthusiastic
again
about
that.
i
should
explain
that
phrase,
"enthusiastic
was
in
a
moment
stricken,"
a
request
of
defense
counsel.
and
they
got
up
and
endorsed
what
lozovsky
said
and
among
them
was
mr.
schneiderman.
he
also
said
that
that
was
true
that
he
believes
such
a
general
strike
was
possible
and
that
such
a
general
strike
would
offer
an
excellent
rehearsal
for
the
seizure
of
power
in
the
united
states
by
the
american
communist
party.
and
comes
a
passage
about
the
striking
of
the
word
"enthusiasm?.
question,
"mr.
honig,
i
now
direct
your
attention
to
the
second
meeting
that
was
at
the
red
international
of
labor
unions."
i
now
direct
your
attention
to
the
second
meeting
that
you
mentioned,
the
one
that
took
place
in
the
common
term
building,
when
did
that
meeting
take
place?"
answer,
"the
same
week
as
the
one
i
mentioned
at
the
red
international
of
labor
unions."
"and
was
it
before
or
after
that
meting?"
"afterward."
"and
who
was
present?"
"myself
and
schneiderman,
lozovsky
again,
dmitry
manuilsky
who
was
the
secretary,
i
believe
was
the
title
head
of
the
communist
international.
a
man
named
(inaudible),
a
man
named
merrin
who
were
jointly
heads
of
the
american
--
anglo-american
secretary
of
the
communist
party."
"about
how
many
other
people
were
there?"
"oh,
i
guess
about
20
people.
25
people
at
the
first
one,
20
people
at
this
one."
isn't
that
--
these
testimonies
all
undenied,
stayed
uncontradicted
in
the
record."
"at
this
meeting,
was
there
a
discussion
of
policy
of
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states?"
"will
you
relate
what
was
said
and
who
said
it?"
"lozovsky
took
the
floor
and
reported
substantially
as
the
head
of
the
red
international
of
labor
unions
on
the
san
francisco
situation.
and
after
he's
finished,
manuilsky,
the
head
of
communist
international,
took
the
floor
and
he
said
that
on
the
basis
of
the
talk
he
have
with
lozovsky,
he
felt
there
was
need
of
immediate
action
on
the
part
of
the
american
communist
party
to
bring
about
such
a
general
strike,
that
i
have
mentioned
in
san
francisco.
that
they
hope
to
start
such
a
general
strike
up
and
down
the
pacific
coast
but
to
start
it
immediately
or
as
soon
as
possible
anyway
in
san
francisco.
and
the
meeting
took
place
--
and
the
meeting
took
a
vote
on
it.
and
there
were
no
abstentions.
there
were
no
abstentions
and
there
were
no
negative
votes.
everybody
voted
that
such
instructions
to
the
american
party
should
immediately
go
forth
from
the
communist
international
to
immediately
prepare
for
such
a
general
strike."
"did
defendant
schneiderman
participate
in
that
discussion?"
"yes
he
did."
"do
you
recall
what
he
said?"
"he
stated
again
as
he
have
stated
at
the
red
international
of
labor
unions
that
he
felt
that
the
situation
will
becoming
right
to
warrant
such
a
general
strike."
now
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
was
that
brought
home?
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
that
was
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
--
that
was
limited
to
schneiderman.
now,
in
due
course,
there
was
a
general
strike
in
san
francisco.
i
had
hoped
to
tell
you
a
little
bit
about
it
but
because
of
the
shortage
of
time,
i'm
just
going
to
say
that
it's
in
the
government's
brief,
the
whole
story
of
san
francisco
general
strike
and
how
the
communist
party
in
its
official
theoretical
organ
called
"the
communist"
took
credit
for
the
bringing
about
of
the
san
francisco
general
strike.
the
strike
that
general
--
head
of
the
n.r.a.,
i
can't
think
of
his
name
now.
johnson
called
bloody
revolution.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it
could
be
vivid
and
still
be
accurate.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
was
all
these
before
--
what
--
what
--
did
this
occur
before
or
after
we
had
schneiderman,
this
case
right
here.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
participation
of
schneiderman
in
the
red
--
in
moscow?
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
that
took
place
in
1934,
sir.
the
schneiderman
case
was
before
this
court
in
1942
and
1943.
but
there
was
no
such
evidence
as
this
in
the
schneiderman
case
of
this
court
heard.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
no.
he
did
not,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
so
far
as
i
know,
honig
was
not
known
to
the
government
and
he
was
a
communist
at
that
time.
is
that
explains
the
situation,
sir?
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
all
right.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes.
he
admit
it
as
i
read
his
testimony.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
he
--
he
said
he
dropped
in,
remember?
he
dropped
in
at
the
red
--
at
the
--
at
the
communist
international.
now,
two
years
later,
in
september
1936,
schneiderman
participated
in
a
party
meeting
in
which
the
idea
of
bringing
out
another
general
strike
was
discussed.
this
one
to
tie
up
not
san
francisco
but
the
entire
west
coast
with
the
objective
of
staging
what,
a
rehearsal
for
the
seizure
of
power
in
this
country.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
a
subsequent
discussion
at
which
schneiderman
participated
in
which
it
was
(inaudible)
the
idea
of
bringing
out
another
general
strike.
this
one
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
rehearsal
for
the
seizure
of
power.
this
one
to
be
a
little
bigger
not
be
limited
to
san
francisco.
they
tie
up
the
whole
west
coast.
another
occasion
in
1936,
schneiderman
advised
a
man
named
carlisle
who
was
the
editor
of
the
western
worker,
the
predecessor
paper
of
the
people's
daily
world
which
--
of
which
mr.
richmond
is
the
editor-in-chief.
and
the
relationship
--
is
the
relationship
of
just
--
i
think
--
i
think
the
western
worker
became
a
daily
and
that
--
in
some
substance
of
it
but
it's
still
control
livestock
and
barrel
by
the
communist
party.
schneiderman
advised
carlisle,
the
editor
of
his
paper,
that
he
was
being
removed
as
editor
because
of
his
--
of
dilettante
attitude
towards
his
job.
he
pointed
out
to
him
that
the
ultimate
aim
of
the
party
and
hence
the
western
workers
only
reason
for
being
was
to
bring
about
a
revolution
in
the
united
states
and
a
seizure
of
power
by
the
communist
party.
schneiderman
told
carlisle
that
his
dilettante
attitude
was
not
serving
such
a
purpose.
one
other
i
--
it's
--
it's
difficult
to
select
this
material
from
schneiderman
they
took
--
there's
so
much
of
it
--
but
i
--
there's
one
other
episode
that
i'd
like
to
relate.
in
february
1947,
schneiderman
addressed
the
party
meeting
on
the
subject
of
left
sectarianism
and
right
deviations.
now,
a
left
sectarian
in
the
party
terminology
is
someone
who
is
too
impatient
to
wait
for
the
signal
to
be
given.
he
wants
to
start
revolution
right
away.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
to
the
extent
of
the
government's
ability
sir,
we
have
tried
to
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
mean
in
the
brief.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
see
no
way,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
but
i
want
to
point
out
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
--
that
in
the
government's
brief
each
petitioner
enlisted
by
name
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
--
and
the
evidence
is
listed
underneath.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
would
leave
the
court
i
should
do
that.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
--
i
agree
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
agree
that
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
way
of
avoiding
the
duty
of
looking
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
at
the
evidence.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
see
no
way,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
testimony
about
schneiderman's
participation
in
moscow
was.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
that
was
brought
in
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
no.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
no.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
no.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
this
was
brought
in
as
evidence
of
william
schneiderman's
intent
in
this
case.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well,
witness
honig
was
called
and
he
was
--
he
was
a
member
of
the
party
since
the
early
1920s,
i
believe,
and
he
told
freely
about
william
schneiderman.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
believe
that
was
introduced
by
counsel
for
petitioner.
incidentally,
this
is
--
this
--
this
testimony
is
a
matter
of
which
the
court
can
take
judicial
notice.
this
is
on
--
it's
in
the
archives
of
this
court.
this
is
the
testimony
of
schneiderman.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
--
i
believe
that
petitioner,
yates,
introduced
certain
evidence
saying
that
she
agreed
with
his
testimony
in
that
case.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
believe
so.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
if
the
exact
same
question
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
--
was
determined,
as
i
understand
the
doctrine
of
collateral
estoppel
that
would
bar.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
oh,
no.
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
objective
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
objective
sought?
the
of
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
don't
mean
(voice
overlap)
as
a
matter
of
--
of
the
--
of
trying
to
get
the
same
relief.
it's
a
question
of
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
what
--
what
issue
was
involved
in
the
case?
what
ultimate
issue?
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
issue
was
whether
or
not
the
government
had
proved
by
clear,
convincing,
persuasive
evidence
that
william
schneiderman,
in
1927
and
during
the
preceding
five
years
was
not
attached
to
the
principles
of
the
constitution
and
they're
well-disposed
to
the
good
order
and
happiness
of
the
united
states.
that
was
the
issue
in
the
schneiderman
case.
that
was
the
only
issue
in
the
schneiderman
case.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
that's
not
quite
what
i
said,
sir.
i
don't
believe.
it
isn't
the
fact
that
one
of
the
denaturalization
case
the
other
one
is
a
criminal
case.
that's
not
it.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
in
1927.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
and
this
is
about
1951.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
court
specifically
so
stated
in
his
opinion
that
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
--
that
was
not
an
issue.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes.
but
that
was
not
an
issue
in
that
case,
in
the
schneiderman
case.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well,
mr.
justice
murphy's
opinion,
sir,
states
explicitly
that
the
issue
in
this
case
is
not
the
nature
of
the
communist
party.
we
have
never
considered
whether
the
communist
party
now
or
ever
has
thought
one
thing
or
another.
he
explicitly
so
stated.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
schneiderman
testified
that
he
agreed
generally
with
the
principles
and
the
statements
and
doctrines
to
be
found
in
the
classics.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
classic
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
but
the
court
didn't
hold
that
they
were
innocent
as
the
freshly
fallen
snow.
he
said
a
tenable
conclusion.
he
said
this
is
not
the
--
he
said
this
is
not
the
--
the
common
sensory
and
this
is
not
the
--
this
is
not
the
evident
mean,
a
tenable
conclusion
is
that
--
that
the
--
the
party
advocates
violence
at
some
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
no,
that's
what
this
court
said.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
not
--
not
according
to
this
court.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
to
the
classics,
not
the
communist
party,
to
the
classics.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
materials
up
--
up
to
1927
we're
the
only
ones
an
issue.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
may
i
read
some
--
the
pertinent
language
of
the
schneiderman
opinion,
sir?
this
court
has
never
passed
upon
the
question
of
whether
the
party
does
so
advocate
force
and
violence
and
it
is
unnecessary
for
us
to
do
so
now.
we
do
not
say
that
a
reasonable
man
could
not
possibly
have
found
as
the
district
court
did
that
the
communist
party
in
1927,
actively
urged
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
but
that
is
not
the
issue
here.
in
so
holding,
we
do
not
decide
what
interpretation
of
the
party's
attitude
towards
force
and
violence
is.
we
do
not
decide
what
interpretation
of
the
party's
attitude
towards
force
and
violence
is
the
most
probable
on
the
basis
of
the
present
record
or
that
petitioner's
testimony
is
acceptable
at
face
value.
we
hold
only
that
where
two
interpretations
of
an
organizations
program
are
possible.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
any
organization.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
think
it
is
general,
he
just
stated
that
--
that
the
--
that
the
nature
of
the
communist
party
is
not
an
issue,
are
passable,
the
one
reprehensible
and
a
bar
to
naturalization
and
the
other
permissible.
a
court
in
a
denaturalization
proceeding
assuming
that
it
can
reexamined
a
finding
of
attachment
upon
a
charge
of
illegal
procurement
is
not
justified
in
canceling
a
certificate
of
citizenship
by
imputing,
see,
by
imputing
the
reprehensible
interpretation
to
a
number
of
the
organization
in
the
absence
of
overt
acts,
indicating
that
such
was
his
interpretation.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
think
there
were
overt
acts
in
this
case.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
meaning
of
the
classics.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
meaning
of
the
--
of
the
classics.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
plus
the
intent.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it
was
a
lot
--
a
lot
of
the
--
a
lot
of
the
classics
that
were
in
evidence
here
that
were
not
evidence
there.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
schneiderman
decision
established
that
schneiderman
has
a
certificate
of
sanity,
as
its
counsel
put
it,
but
it's
dated
1927.
and
what
is
more,
the
certificate
does
not
say
that
he
was
sane
then.
it
says
that
the
government
did
not
prove
by
the
requisite
degree
of
evidence
that
he
was
not
sane.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
(voice
overlap)
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
did
--
does
it
have
to
be
the
same
individual?
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
why
would
you
argue
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
--
individual.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
but
the
--
but
the
only
finding
of
fact
that
was
peculiar
to
schneiderman
was
his
state
of
mind,
not
--
not
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
--
the
concepts
of
the
classics.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
and
the
court
did
not
say
that
it
meant
the
other
thing.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
court
said
that
it
was
a
tenable
conclusion.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
on
--
with
respect
--
well,
now,
can
you
litigate
that
again?
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
with
respect
to
those
books
that
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
we
--
it's
possible
to
--
to
--
here's
a
book
that
wasn't
in
evidence.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
and
this
was
a
book
that
was
used
of
a
textbooks
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
--
by
one
of
these
petitioners.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
believe
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
because
the
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
think
as
--
as
long
as
the
matter
is
evidential
and
not
the
issue,
it's
permissible.
and
you
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
--
if
a
man
is
acquitted
of
--
of
shooting
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
--
it
doesn't
mean
that
you
can't
be
convicted
of
shooting
why
with
this
gun.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
believe,
sir,
that
if
your
contention
is
carried
through,
to
it's
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well,
i'm
--
that's
what
i
mean
right
now,
sir.
carry
to
it
to
the
full
extent
of
his
logic.
that
would
mean
that
these
classics
couldn't
be
used
against
anybody
anymore.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
but
is
that
--
that
is
not
a
relevant
point
to
the
--
to
what
we
are
talking
about
though
the
fact
that
they
haven't
been
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
court
looked
at
these
--
at
these
classics
objectively.
that
they
read
what's
in
the
classics
objectively,
not
--
not
with
--
not
with
necessarily
with
the
relation
to
schneiderman.
i
say
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
believe
that
under
your
point,
sir,
that
the
judge
would
have
to
instruct
the
jury
in
all
--
all
smith
act
cases
that
a
tenable
conclusion
from
these
classics
is
this.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well,
sir
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
i
believe
you
did,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
would
say
not,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
would
say
not.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well
that
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
that
is
the
point
that
i've
mentioned
a
minute
ago.
i
--
i
believe
under
mr.
justice
black's
contention,
the
logic
of
that
contention
would
require
that
that
--
that
the
jury
be
so
instructed.
and
not
just
about
schneiderman,
against
anybody,
against
mr.
dennis
because
it
was
those
classics
that
were
used
in
the
dennis
case.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
you
were
asking
me
sir?
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
and
my
observation
is
i
failed
to
see
why
not.
you
see
that's
--
that's
the
rule
but
i
don't
see
the
reason
behind
that
rule
is
my
point.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i'll
take
it
out
right
now
if
you
like
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i'm
--
i'm
going
to
come
to
it
very
shortly.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
that
double-barreled
argument.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well,
may
i
answer
right
now
sir?
i'd
like
to
answer
right
now
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
--
if
i
may?
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
think
that
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
situation
is
just
--
i
believe
just
the
reverse
of
the
way
you
put
it.
if
he
had
charged
the
--
they
--
had
to
find
either
one
or
the
other.
then
it
could
not
be
determined
from
their
verdict
which
of
those
they
found.
and
therefore,
it
would
be
incumbent
upon
the
government
to
--
to
defend
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
as
to
both
but
since
he
charged
that
they
had
to
find
both
organizing
and
advocacy.
and
since
they
--
in
order
to
convict
and
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it's
--
we
still
know
that
the
jury
found
--
found
the
defendant's
guilty
under
the
advocacy
branch
of
the
indictment.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
because
they
were
told
that
they
had
to
find
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
in
the
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
but
at
least
we
--
at
least
we
know
that
they
found
them
guilty
under
that
branch
of
the
indictment
which
you
say
they
were
properly
--
that
doesn't
left
to
them
--
that
wasn't
left
with
them.
they
found
that
they
were
found
guilty
under
a
branch
of
the
indictment
containing
two
--
two
clauses,
two
lanes,
one
of
which
was
a
--
was
written
in
that
--
they
couldn't
rest
that.
and
therefore,
we
do
not
know
whether
they
were
fraud
in
the
verdict
on
the
advocacy,
if
they've
been
properly
instructed
under
organize
the
ultimate
relation
then
as
to
what
the
jury
had
done.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
we
--
we
know
that
they
found
them
guilty
under
advocacy.how
do
we
know
that?
because
they
were
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
they
had
to.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
right.
but
i
still
say
they
found
them
guilty
under
the
advocacy
branch.
they
found
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
jury
found
them
guilty
of
both
because
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
didn't
get
the
last
point
you
made,
your
honor,
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
we're
--
we're
assuming
for
argument
that
the
one
was
error.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
--
i
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
think
--
i
think
they're
separable
--
i
think
they're
separable.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
don't
understand
your
honors
point,
how
the
jury
might
have
mingled
them.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well,
but
you
can
read
the
instructions.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
we
must
assume
that
they
followed
the
judge's
instruction
and
the
judge
instructed
--
instructed
them
that
they
had
to
find
both
to
convict.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
and
they
did.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
don't
quite
follow
your
honors
reasoning
there,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
but
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
but
that
argument
is
not
of
greater
importance
in
the
government's
position
then
our
argument
that
the
jury
was
properly
instructed.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
and
i
believe
that
the
judge
in
the
mesarosh
case
did
too.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
--
i'm
not
prepared
to
make
such
a
broad
statement
of
that,
sir.
i
--
i
know
of
two
judges
that
has
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
is
that
so.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
know
that
the
judge
in
the
flynn
case
did
and
--
in
--
i
believe
in
the
mesarosh
case
too
but
i'm
not
informed
as
to
the
other
smith
act
cases.
now,
let
me
give
a
couple
of
other
examples
of
how
the
communist
party
is
constantly
organizing.
spector,
in
1936
came
out
from
new
york
to
become
the
county
organizer
in
san
francisco.
some
14
years
later,
in
1950
he's
identified
as
the
southern
division
organizer
of
los
angeles
county.
in
1945,
lima
is
the
field
organizer,
working
out
in
the
san
francisco
office.
three
years
later,
he's
again
identified
in
the
record
as
a
field
organizer
of
the
same
party
etcetera.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
that
for
example
taking
a
section,
breaking
it
up
into
new
units,
amalgamating
sections
making
activities
designed
to
make
the
party
more
effective
as
the
dictionary
defines
it,
a
more
effective
organization.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
that,
plus
the
breaking
up
of
--
of
units,
the
amalgamation
of
units
that
whole
process
is
in
a
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes.
i
think
that
that
is.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
he
--
yes.
he
says
the
--
that
includes
recruitment.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
and
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
and
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case
testified
that
that
was
part
of
her
duties
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
--
as
the
organizational
secretary.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes.
he
--
he
included
that
among
other
things.
he
didn't
say
that
alone.
he
said
this
plus
the
process
of
dividing
and
rebalancing
and
regrouping,
he
lump
them
all
together.
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
pardon
me
sir?
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
and
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
oh,
a
minister.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
revitalize,
revivify
his
congregations
and
so
forth?
yes,
i
think
so.
i
think
that
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
improve
it
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
--
build
it
up.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
anything
--
anything
directed
towards
making
the
organization
more
effective
for
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
created.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
think
it's
a
realistic
meaning
in
the
--
in
the
light
of
--
of
a
--
particularly,
in
the
light
of
the
congressional
intent.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
no.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
no.
for
the
reasons
which
mr.
justice
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
you
want
--
you
want
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
in
other
words,
you
understand
the
alternative?
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
not
--
not
working
is
working
among
those
were
already
organized.
the
recruitment
of
fresh
blood
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
exactly.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
exactly.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
verb
organized
includes
the
recruiting
of
new
members,
as
what
he
said
among
other
things.
now,
congress
when
it
passed
the
smith
act
--
mr.
justice
harlan,
in
reply
to
your
question
a
moment
ago,
i'm
informed
by
enclose
shift
that
judge
mathes
charged
was
followed
in
the
smith
act
cases
in
honolulu,
seattle,
saint
louis,
denver,
new
heaven
and
detroit.
in
1940,
when
congress
passed
the
smith
act,
which
new
--
which
had
the
organize
language
in
it.
it
is
perfectly
clear
from
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
that,
perhaps,
the
organization
that
they
had
in
mind
was
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states.
now,
that
party
originally
was
organized
in
this
country
in
1919.
now,
if
the
petitioner's
theory
is
correct,
it
would
mean
that
the
communist
party,
i
mean
that
the
organized
clause
of
the
communist
party,
could
never
been
applied
to
the
communist
party
since
1917
was
more
than
three
years
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
smith
act
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
--
hadn't
not
been
for
the
fortuitous
interlude
of
the
communist
political
association
from
1944
to
1945.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
would
--
but
if
you
say
that
if
there's
a
section
and
the
section
is
broken
into
two.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
a
new
--
a
new
unit
has
--
a
break
off
from
an
old
unit.
say
there's
a
unit
in
a
southern
part
of
los
angeles,
i
say.
a
new
unit
is
created.
you
said
that
you
had
no
problem
there.
that
is
organizing.
but
this
general
work
all
over
--
not
only
with
california
but
all
over
the
country.
the
principal
purpose
of
which
is
getting
up
new
members
into
the
organization
as
--
as
petitioner
yates
said,
"to
make
the
party
a
bigger
and
more
effective
organization,"
you
--
you
apply
it
and
you
have
to
say
you
have
difficulty
in
--
in
applying
organize
to
that
concept.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
is
it
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
but
what
are
you
--
how
do
you
organize?
you're
organizing
the
new
units.
are
you
organizing
the
party?
i
mean
are
you
organizing
the
--
the
main
organization?
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
mean
the
smith
act
says
it
should
be
unlawful
to
organize
a
group
assembly
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
--
or
society
of
person.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
think
that
the
--
that
the
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
--
the
clear
--
the
plain
meaning
of
the
smith
act
in
the
light
of
its
legislative
history
is
that
what
they're
talking
about
is
the
organization
of
a
group,
like
the
communist
party.
it's
clear
to
ask
what's
the
--
what's
the
--
the
aim
of
the
smith
act.
there's
no
doubt
really
about
that.
and
not
--
and
not
just
units
of
the
party
but
the
party.
now,
i'd
like
to
speak
very
briefly
if
i
may
on
the
contention
of
the
petitioner's
that
they
were
denied
a
fair
trial.
their
contention
is
divisible
into
two
parts.
at
the
time
that
the
trial
started
there
was
running
in
a
local
paper
in
los
angeles,
a
series
of
articles
by
herbert
philbrick
who
was
one
of
the
dennis
witnesses
on
telling
about
his
--
his
experiences
in
the
communist
party.
i
think
it
was
called
"i
led
three
lives"
or
some
--
something
like
that.
this
was
syndicated
nationally.
petitioners
asked
for
a
60-day
continuance,
asked
a
60-day
period
to
commence
at
the
end
of
the
running
of
that
series
of
articles
before
the
--
the
trial
started.
that
motion
was
denied
and
the
petitioners
contend
the
denial
of
that
continuance
was
prejudicial
error.
their
voider
examination
of
the
prospective
jurors
in
this
case
however
indicates
that
the
judge
asked
all
the
prospective
jurors
on
the
panel,
whether
or
not
they
had
read
or
seen
anything
about
these
series
of
articles
and
all
except
one,
said
they
had
not
seen
anything
about
it.
and
this
one,
a
woman
named
flanagan
was
not
among
the
persons
selected
for
jury
to
read.
now,
it
is
true
that
that
series
of
articles
continued
for
a
few
days
beyond
that
questioning
into
the
beginning
of
the
trial.
but
the
judge
explicitly
admonished
all
the
jurors
that
they
were
to
read
nothing
about
the
case
and
that
they
were
to
base
their
verdict
solely
upon
the
evidence
they
heard
adduced
in
the
courtroom.
now,
the
petitioners
speak
about
building
inference
on
inference.
i
say
there's
an
inference
on
inference
to
assume
that
the
jurors
must
have
violated
that
explicit
instruction
of
the
judge
in
that
respect.
the
judge
emphasized
to
the
jurors
in
this
manner.
he
said,
"if
we
could
try
these
cases
upon
what
the
jury
reads
in
the
magazine
or
hears
over
television
or
sees
in
a
newsreel,
or
reads
in
the
paper,
it
wouldn't
be
necessary
for
you
to
come
down
at
all,
we
could
just
ask
you
to
mail
in
your
ballot
as
to
whether
or
not
the
defendant
is
guilty
of
innocent.
but
that
is
incompetent
evidence.
in
order
to
have
a
jury
that
is
absolutely
impartial,
we
have
to
have
people
who
can
decide
the
issue,
not
upon
something
they've
heard
or
read
outside
the
courtroom
but
upon
the
evidence
adduced
here
in
a
lawful
and
competent
manner."
well,
in
other
words
we
start
out
with
a
jury,
all
of
whom
have
sworn
that
they
--
that
they
have
not
read
anything
about
the
philbrick
articles
and
then
they're
instructed
along
this
line
all
the
way
to
through
the
trial.
the
government
contends
that
there
is
no
substance
at
all
for
that
contention.
now,
the
second
facet
of
the
argument
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
who
is
philbrick?
was
he
a
government
employee?
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
he
was
a
government
witness
in
the
dennis
case.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
he
was
a
confidential
informer.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
he
had
been
in
the
party,
just
about
what
his
natural
rate,
we're
not
informed
whether
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well,
his
financial
arrangements
were,
i
am
not
informed
whether
he
got
a
pay
or
expenses
on
what
it
was.
i'm
not
informed
about
that.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
not
to
my
knowledge,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
now,
the
second
facet
of
that
contention
has
to
do
with
a
release
put
out
by
the
internal
security
subcommittee
entitled
documentary
proof
that
the
communist
party,
u.s.a.
teaches
and
advocates
the
overthrow
and
destruction
of
the
united
states
government
by
force
and
violence.
this
consist
of
a
compilation
of
material
which
was
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
no.
this
is
a
separate.
this
is
something
entirely
separate.
this
--
this
document
was
published
by
the
committee.
it
contains
--
a
--
a
brochure
put
up
by
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
and
given
to
the
committee
at
the
request
of
the
committee
in
which
various
materials
from
these
classics
are
assembled
as
proof
that
the
party
teaches
force
and
violence.
now,
this
committee
point
was
released
to
the
public
at
a
time,
i
think,
during
the
closing
arguments
in
this
case.
and
it
got
a
lot
of
nationwide
publicity
including
publicity
in
the
papers
in
los
angles.
now
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
internal
security
subcommittee
of
the
judiciary
committee,
the
mccarran
subcommittee.
the
petitioners
have
from
the
beginning
cleaned
and
least
insinuated
that
this
was
given
out
by
the
mccarran
committee
with
the
express
design
of
a
--
of
a
--
influencing
this
case
but
without
a
shred
of
--
there's
not
a
shred
of
evidence
in
the
record
to
substantiate
that
claim.
now,
the
--
the
way
the
matter
was
handled
was
--
it's
as
follows.
i
think
i
can
best
give
the
thinking
of
the
judge
--
they
moved
for
mistrial.
they
moved
for
a
mistrial
on
the
basis
of
this.
that
the
court
said,
the
colloquy
of
counsel
about
this
matter.
"is
there
anything
in
any
of
this
material,
even
if
we
were
to
assume
that
the
jury
have
seen
it?
is
there
anything
but
quotations
that
are
involved
here?"
i'm
reading
from
page
15655
of
the
green
--
green
bound
record.
and
6
--
13657,
the
court
says
"assuming
for
the
purpose
of
this
discussion
that
the
jury
has
read
it,
could
it
be
any
possible
news
to
them
that
the
department
of
justice
make
such
contention?
i
do
not
think
it
could
possibly
be
new
as
to
them
if
the
head
of
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
so
believes."
the
court
"who
is
stating
it?"
"mr.
showman
a
defense
counsel,
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation,
in
fact
the
government
of
the
united
states."
the
court
"would
that
be
any
surprise
to
the
jury
that
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation,
two
of
whose
members
have
sat
here
throughout
this
trial,
contend
that
the
communist
party
so
advocates."
the
court
"very
well,
i
will
ask
you
again".
he's
now
speaking
to
defense
counsel.
"do
you
suppose
it
could
possibly
be
any
surprise
to
this
jury
that
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
contends
with
the
communist
party
throughout
the
case?"
anyone
who
reads
the
article
sees
that
the
source
of
a
stalin
statement,
the
stalin
statement
is
the
report
quotes,
"the
russian
premier
as
writing
in
1939,
proletarian
revolution
is
impossible
without
the
forcible
destruction
of
the
bourgeois
state
machine
and
the
substitution
part
of
a
new
one."
"it
seems
to
me
i've
heard
that
right
here
several
times
in
the
last
six
months."
the
court
"when
the
matter
was
presented
yesterday
morning,
i
thought
there
was
possibly
something
new.
i
haven't
seen
the
article.
but
when
i
read
the
article,
i
didn't
see
anything
at
all
in
it
that
any
person
in
this
courtroom,
who
had
attended
this
trial
wouldn't
recognize
as
having
been
read
here,
not
once
but
several
times.
and
a
thought
it
occurred
to
me
that
of
all
the
people
in
this
community
who
would
be
least
affected
by
that
article,
the
jury
would
be
and
the
counsel
and
the
court
in
this
case
who
sat
here
for
several
months,
hearing
that
sort
of
thing,
read.
to
whom
it
would
be
no
news,
whatever."
skipping
again,
"of
course
we
would
like
to
have
nothing
mentioned
in
the
press
or
anywhere
else
that
could
possibly
influence,
even
the
community
while
a
case
such
as
this
is
under
way.
but
the
world
can't
stop
while
the
trial
goes
on."
the
court
"let
me
ask
you
then,
do
you
suppose
when
it
is
known,
when
--
when
one
of
the
most
mentioned
names
in
this
case
of
the
fbi,
when
you
gentlemen
for
the
defense
have
brought
out
time
and
time
again
at
this
trial
that
two
members
of
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
sit
there
at
counsel
table
throughout
the
trial."
"do
you
suppose
that
any
member
of
the
jury
would
be
naïve
enough
to
believe
that
j.edgar
hoover,
the
head
of
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
has
contrary
ideas
to
what
was
being
urged
by
the
government?"
but
despite
that,
the
judge
offered
to
defense
counsel
to
query
the
jury
as
follows.
whether
any
of
them
had
seen
the
article
or
any
reference
to
it
in
the
press
and
if
so,
whether
any
of
those
who
had
seen
such
reference
felt
in
any
degree,
whatever,
disable
from
basing
his
verdict,
solely
upon
the
evidence
in
the
case.
now,
i
know
that
petitioners
in
their
reply
brief
say
that
their
objection
to
--
to
that
question
was
the
fact
that
it
was
a
compound
question.
that
they
wanted
first
to
ask
whether
any
of
the
jurors
had
heard
it.
and
secondly,
to
have
it
broken
down
and
secondly,
as
--
so
--
so
that
it
could
be
determined
whether
any
had.
and
secondly,
to
find
out
from
those
who
had
read
it,
whether
they
had
been
unduly
influence
so
as
to
render
them
unable
to
return
a
verdict.
however,
the
government
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
that's
not
--
that
is
not
so,
sir.
that
is
the
point
that
they
make
in
a
reply
brief.
the
record
does
not
substantiate
that
as
i
shall
now
proceed
to
show.
the
court
"there
will
be
only
one
question."
i
now
read
13714."
there
will
be
only
one
question.
it
is
whether
that
has
happened
to
them
and
if
so,
has
it
affected
them
in
such
way,
any
of
them
that
they
feel
they
could
not
with
open
mind
decide
this
case
solely
upon
the
evidence
adduced
here
as
they
are
duty
bound
and
ought
bound
to
do
and
that
is
all."
then
we
take
their
word,
whatever
it
is.
now,
mr.
leonid,
one
of
the
defense
attorneys
says,
"your
honor
there
seems
to
be
two
questions."
one
is
"did
they
see
these
articles,
newspapers
or
hear
the
radio
stories?"
and
the
second
was
"what
your
honor
proposed,
what
effect
did
that
have
on
them?
and
could
they
lay
it
aside
and
so
forth?"
the
court
"i
expect
to
put
it
as
a
compound
inquiry.
it
is
a
matter
for
the
jurors'
conscience
now."
mr.
leonid
continues.
"it
is
our
view
of
the
law,
any
questions
with
respect
to
what
effects
such
articles
and
stories
had
on
the
jury,
if
there
is
a
showing
that
juror
saw
the
article
or
read
the
story
are
immaterial
and
irrelevant
because
we
think
once
that
showing
is
made
then
there
has
been
an
intrusion
and
we
want
the
record
to
show,
we
would
object.
we
would
object
to
questions
with
respect
to
the
effect
of
such
articles
upon
the
mind
of
the
jury
and
because
it
is
our
view
that
they
should
be
limited
to
whether
they
saw
the
articles
or
heard
about
it."
the
court
"i
understand
your
views."
mr.
leonid
"again,
your
honor
just
to
state
our
position
and
then
your
honor
can
rule.
we
think
there
are
two
main
questions
here.
did
they
see
the
articles
or
hear
the
radio
report
to
which
we
are
clearly
have
no
objection
that
we
urge
your
honor
to
inquire
into?
and
second
one
--
secondly,
the
question
your
honor
suggested
the
effect
of
such
a
reading
or
such
a
hearing.
that
question
we
think
is
immaterial
and
irrelevant
and
it
is
that
question
that
we
would
make
an
objection
to."
the
court
"just
a
moment,
do
you
mean
you
don't
want
me
to
ask
what
effect
it
had?
you
don't
wish
me
to
invite
them
to
say
whether
any
of
them
feel
if
they
have
heard
or
read
something,
they
can't
go
ahead
with
open
mind."
mr.
leonid
"we
think
as
a
matter
of
law,
there
is
only
one
result
that
could
flow
from
anybody
having
read
or
seen
these
articles.
we
think
if
there
is
a
factual
showing
of
this
kind
of
an
intrusion
that
the
other
question
is
immaterial
and
so
forth."
it's
--
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
defense
counsel
were
telling
the
court
that
they
didn't
want
the
other
question.
therefore,
the
government
insists
upon
the
statement
that
it
has
in
its
brief
that
--
that
--
that
the
defense
insisted
upon
a
mistrial
if
anyone
saw
this
material
without
any
inquiry
as
to
what
effect
it
had
upon
them.
and
before
i
sit
down,
i'd
like
to
call
the
attention
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
opinion
in
the
flynn
case
where
this
very
same
document
was
involved.
and
as
he
pointed
out
there,
the
fact
that
--
now
if
--
if
there
is
if
--
there's
one
--
there's
this
one
difference
between
the
flynn
case
and
this
case.
the
jury
were
questioned
as
to
whether
or
not
they've
seen
this
article.
however,
as
mr.
justice
harlan
points
out
in
the
flynn
case,
they
were
not
questioned
as
to
whether
or
not
they
have
seen
any
of
the
newspaper
publicity
tackled
with
it.
but
mr.
justice
harlan
points
out
that
that
is
unimportant
because
of
the
fact
of
the
explicit
and
clear
instructions
that
the
jury
got
all
through
the
trial
and
in
--
and
in
the
charge
that
they
were
to
consider
the
--
their
verdict
solely
upon
what
was
adduced
in
the
courtroom
and
nothing
that
they
heard
outside.
and
so
that
reason,
we
think,
that
the
--
the
--
that
the
flynn
decision
on
this
point
is
in
all
force
on
this
point
and
we
suggest
--
submit
that
there
is
no
merit
whatever
in
the
contention
that
a
mistrial
should
have
been
declared
on
this
matter.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court?
i
believe
that,
i
say
this
with
respect
that
the
record
is
clear,
that
this
contempt
comes
under
18
u.s.c.
401,
paragraph
3.
it
is
true
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
pointed
out,
that
the
certificate
of
contempt
describes
the
contempt
has
having
occurred
in
the
presence
of
the
court,
but
the
judge
did
not
thereby
mean
to
say
that
because
he
thereby
described
where
these
contempts
occurred
that
he
was
limiting
it
to
401,
18
u.s.c.
401(1).
the
whole
context
and
all
the
colloquy
around
this
sentence
appears
in
the
record,
it
is
clear
that
he
was
putting
it
under
401(3).
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
believe
that
if
a
contempt
clearly
meets
401(3),
a
disobedience
of
the
valid
order,
that
it
would
be
excluded
from
401(1).
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
misbehavior
other
than
a
disobedience
of
a
valid
order
because
401(3)
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
401(3)
covers
that.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well,
but
this
is
a
--
the
third
paragraph
of
a
unified
statute.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well,
correct
me
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
wasn't
the
point
of
--
and
i
confused
--
wasn't
the
point
of
hudgins
that
what
--
he
did
answer,
did
he
not?
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
he
did
answer.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
but
the
point
is
that
hudgins
did
answer,
he
answered
perhaps
perjuriously,
perhaps
evasively,
but
here
there
was
a
refusal
to
answer.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
if
an
answer
was
given,
even
though
it
may
have
been
perjurious
or
evasive
it
was
an
answer.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well
of
course
all
witnesses
are
supposed
to
tell
the
truth.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
but
the
committing
of
perjury
is
not
a
contempt
as
this
court
has
held.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
think
the
hudgins
is
taken
care
of
by
the
fact
that
there
was
what
purported
to
be
what
was
claimed
to
be
a
truthful
answer.
now
if
the
fact
that
was
evasive
and
perjurious
does
not
detract
from
the
fact
that
an
answer
was
given,
which
i
think
distinguishes
this
case.
but
furthermore
i
don't
know
--
i
do
not
rest
on
that
point
there
was
obstruction
here.
my
argument
is
two
pronged,
it
comes
within
401(3)
which
does
not
require
an
obstruction
but
there
was
an
obstruction
here.
what
was
the
purpose
of
these
questions?
this,
this
witness
was
on
cross
examination.
under
it
she
had
testified
that
she
had
never
conspired
with
anyone
to
advocate
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
and
that
to
the
best
of
her
knowledge
and
belief,
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states
did
not
so
teach
or
advocate.
now
that
goes
to
the
heart
of
what
this
case
was
about.
the
indictment
charged
the
defendants
with
having
conspired
to
advocate
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
and
to
organize
as
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states
a
group
of
persons
who
so
advocate
and
teach.
the
communist
party
under
the
government's
theory
was
the
instrumentality,
the
vehicle
of
this
conspiracy
and
this
court
recognized
it
in
the
yates'
opinion
last
term.
therefore
when
the
--
mrs.
yates
made
what
was
referred
to
in
the
record
as
the
bold,
bold
denial
that
she
knew,
that
she
ever
advocated
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
or
that
the
communist
party
had
ever
so
thought,
it
became
relevant
for
the
prosecution
to
test,
to
test
the
veracity,
the
credibility
et
cetera
of
that
direct
testimony
by
inquiring
--
by
asking
her
these
questions
as
to
whether
not
she
knew
these
various
persons
who
have
played
such
a
prominent
part
in
the
government's
case
whether
she
knew
they
had
been
communists
or
not.
the
issue
was
--
i
mean
i
think
the
purpose
of
these
questions
was
not
to
get
her
to
inform
on
anyone,
the
government,
the
government's
testimony
clearly
established
that
these
persons
were
communists,
but
as
on
page
5
to
6
of
the
record,
the
point
of
these
questions
i
think
becomes
clearer.
in
specification
4,
“is
it
not
true
that
ida
rothstein
has
for
the
last
five
or
six
years
at
least
been
a
club
chairman
or
the
leader
of
one
or
more
of
the
clubs
of
the
communist
party
situated
in
the
city
of
san
francisco?”
answer,
“that
is
asking
me
to
say
that
ida
rothstein
is
a
communist.”
“i
will
ask
you
that
question,
is
ida
rothstein
a
communist
then?”
the
witness,
“i
decline
to
answer
it.”
mr.
nucum
does
--
your
honor
--
then
the
court
says,
“you
understand
--”
addressing
the
witness,
“you
understand
that
question
to
be,
is
she
known
to
you
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party.”
the
witness,
“yes
i
do
your
honor.”
“is
that
the
way
you
understand
the
question?”
the
witness,
“yes
i
do
so
understand
the
question.”
“you
are
instructed
to
answer
the
question,”
et
cetera.
the
point
of
these
questions
is
were
these
people
known
to
witness
as
communists.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
petitioner
--
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well
that
was
--
that
would
be
relevant
–
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
--
to
the
--
to
her
denial
that
the
communist
party
--
that
she
ever
had
advocated
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
because
it
was
a
–
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it
was
the
government's
theory
that
these
defendants
had
conspired
to
advocate
the
overthrow
the
government
through
the
instrumentality
of
the
communist
party.
and
therefore
it
becomes
--
certainly
became
relevant
as
part
of
the
whole
picture
as
to
whether
or
not
these
persons
who
she
admitted
she
knew,
some
of
them
she
knew
for
20
years,
whether
she
knew
they
were
communists.
in
any
event
that
was
the,
that
was
the
relevance
of
the
questions
and
therefore
when
the
witness
refused
to
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
government's
evidence
showed
that
they
were
communists,
yes.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
defense
had
not
denied
it,
but
it
was
not
--
it
was
not
admitted
on
the
record
your
honor.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it
was
undisputed
but
it
was
not
admitted.
so
therefore
i
would
conclude
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
certainly
there
was
evidence
of
statements
which
had
been
attributed
to
these
people
or
some
of
these
people
from
which
the
jury
could
infer
as
part
of
the
whole
picture
that
they
were
parties
to
a
conspiracy.
well
for
example
this
ida
rothstein
case,
one
of
the
prominent
passages
in
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
the
yates
case
of
last
term
dealt
with
ida
rothstein
and
she
was
one
of
the
teachers
at
the
san
francisco
classes
in
1946.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
these
were
limited
to
communist
party
members.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
they
were
secret,
in
that
essence,
they
were
party
teachers
and
the
most,
the
most
significant
aspect
of
her
teachings
as
the
court
will
recall
was
her
analogy
of
the
san
francisco
general
strike
to
the
paris
commune
when
she
said
that
here
was
a
time
when
labor
held
power
for
three
days
and
if
the
political
consciousness
of
the
people
and
labor
had
been
more
mature,
they
could
have
gone
further
and
taken
over
the
government
or
words
to
that
effect
and
she
said
next
time
you
have
got
to
be
more
ready
--
ready
for
a
situation
like
that.
now
in
light
of
testimony
such
as
that,
it
became
entirely
relevant
for
the
prosecutor
to
ask
mrs.
yates
whether
she
knew
if
mrs.
rothstein,
whom
she
admitted
knowing
for
20
years
i
believe
or
something
like
that,
knew
that
she
was
a
communist.
it
certainly
was
part
of
the
general
picture
that
was
dealt
at
the
trial,
but
now
i
should
like
to
get
to
the
point
of
whether
or
not
the
judge
had
exhausted
his
power
to
sentence
for
contempt
on
june
30th.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well
my
answer
is,
is
i
said
two
pronged,
there
was
an
obstruction
here
but
it
was
not
necessary
to
prove
an
obstruction
because
it
came
squarely
within
the
terms
of
401(3)
disobedience
of
a
valid
order
of
the
court
which
does
not
require
that
there
be
an
obstruction.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well
perhaps,
perhaps
the
way
you
would
answer
the
question
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
if
it
was,
if
it
was
relevant
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well
right
perhaps
that's
the
answer.
this
was
a
relevant
question.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well
perhaps
your
honor
was
suggesting
that
401(3)
is
superfluity.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well
that
could
be
an
disobedience
of
an
order
of
the
court
which
do
not
take
place
in
the
court.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well
perhaps
congress'
point
was
that
if
a
violation,
a
disobedience
of
a
specific
order
that
that
should
end
and
there
should
not
be
any
necessity
of
inquiring
into
whether
or
not
there
was
obstruction.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well,
in
any
event
i
continue
to
insist
that
there
was
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
all
right,
now
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it
is
the
petitioner's
contention
that
there
was
just
one
contempt
committed
over
this
two-day
period
june
26th
and
june
30th
and
when
the
judge
sentenced
her
for
civil
contempt
on
the
first
day
he
thereby
exhausted
his
sentencing
power
with
respect
to
that
single
contempt
here
assumed
to
be
single
for
purposes
of
argument
so
that
on
the
third
day
of
her
cross
examination
june
30th,
he
could
--
he
just
lacked
the
power
to
impose
a
criminal
sentence.
the
government's
reply
to
that
is
likewise
two
pronged.
we
say
that
the
premise
is
unsound,
but
even
if
it
were
sound,
the
conclusion
does
not
follow
and
i
think
that
if
i
can
sustain
that,
the
court
will
agree
that
there
was
not
much
left
to
that
argument.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
none
was
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
none
whatsoever
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
that's
not
in
this
record.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well
at
least
i
am
glad
to
answer
that
--
i
have
you
in
the
first
point
there
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
prove
it
affirmative.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
but
in
any
event
that's
not
this
case.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
now
i
should
–
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument,
i
shall
first
assume
that
there
was
just
one
contempt,
but
clearly
it
is
government's
position
that
this
contempt
continued
from
june
26th
to
june
30th.
it
was
a
continuous
offense.
now
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
settled,
have
clearly
settled
the
point
that
a
single
act
of
contempt
can
be
made
the
basis
for
both
a
civil
sentence
and
a
criminal
sentence,
i
refer
your
honors
to
the
(inaudible)
case,
the
mine
workers
case,
and
penfield
versus
the
securities
exchange
commission.
perhaps
the
following
quotation
from
mr.
justice
douglas'
opinion
speaking
for
the
court
in
penfield
will
make
this
point
clear.
“we
assume,”
he
said,
“arguendo
that
the
statute
401,
usc
401
allowing
fine
or
imprisonment
governs
civil
as
well
as
criminal
contempt
proceedings.
if
a
statute
is
so
construed
we
find
in
it
no
barrier
to
the
imposition
of
both
the
fine
as
a
punitive
exaction
and
imprisonment
as
a
coercive
sanction
or
vice
versa.”
skipping
a
bit,
“when
the
court
imposes
a
fine
as
a
penalty
it
is
punishing
yesterdays
contemptuous
conduct
when
it
adds
the
coercive
sanction
of
imprisonment
it
is
announcing
the
consequences
of
tomorrow's
contumacious
conduct.”
now
in
that
case
there
was
a
dissent,
but
the
dissent
was
not
relevant
to
this
point.
it
follows
therefore
that
it
lay
within
the
powers
of
judge
mathes
to
impose
both
a
civil
contempt
sentence
and
a
criminal
contempt
sentence
for
petitioner's
contemptuous
series
of
refusals,
which
i
herein
assume
to
be
but
one
contempt.
now
--
but
even
if
i
were
wrong
on
that
point,
i
now
argue
that
there
was
more
than
one
contempt.
there
were,
now
the
number
of
contempts
that
there
were
i
shall
infer
for
the
moment,
i'll
reach
it
very
shortly,
but
what
i
am,
what
i
now
propose
to
argue
is
that
there
were
more
than
one
contempt
at
least,
at
least
two
and
that
is
all
that
is
necessary
even
under
a
petitioner's
contention
to
establish
the
validity
of
the
criminal
contempt
sentence
of
june
30th.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
of
the
cases
which
establish
that
proposition
that
one
contempt,
one
act
of
contempt
maybe
made
the
subject
of
both
civil
and
criminal,
it
was
a
simultaneous.
it
was
not,
it
was
not
--
in
other
words
it
was
not
a
continuing
offense
as
here,
but
the
government's
view
is
that
is
not,
that
doesn't
make
any
difference.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
but
it
is
of
essence
of
this
argument
that
this
one
contempt
be
a
continuing
contempt.
in
other
words,
it
did
not
--
it
was
not
completed
on
the
first
day
but
it
continued
on
to
june
30th
too.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yeah.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
oh
no
i
am
not
suggesting
that
she
could
be
punished
criminally
a
dozen
times,
she
could
only
be
punished
criminally
once
for
this
one
contempt.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
oh,
no
i
misunderstood.
i
thought
you
meant
was
the
offense,
a
single
offense
that
occurred
at
one
point
of
time.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
think
the
penfield
case
is
at
least
analogous.
in
the
penfield
case
she
was
first
--
the
witness
was
first
subjected
to
a
criminal
fine
of
$50.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
and
the
government
appealed
from
that
on
the
ground
that
the
proceeding
--
that
the
judge
had
in
effect
abused
his
discretion
by
fining
the
witnesses
$50
and
it
should
have
subjected
him
to
a
civil
sentence
of
imprisonment
until
the
witness
agreed
to
answer.
the
government
argued
that
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
and
this
court
upheld
the
court
of
appeals,
but
there
the,
it
was
just
a
reverse
of
this.
there
the
criminal
sentence
came
first
and
the
civil
sentence
was
there
after
imposed
by
the
appellate
court
but
at
two
different
times.
now
here
it
was
just
the
other
way
around.
here
the
civil
sentence
came
first
and
a
criminal
sentence
came
thereafter,
but
i
think
that
the
principle
will
be
the
same.
now,
it
is
the
government's
position
that
there
were
as
many
contempts
committed
as
there
were
persons
who
were
the
subject
matters
of
the
questions
in
over
this
two-day
period
with
one
qualification,
which
i
shall
mention
in
a
moment.
in
other
words,
in
these,
in
this
two-day
period
there
were
a
total
of
10
persons
concerning
whom
mrs.
yates
was
questioned,
two
on
the
first
day
and
eight
on
the
second
day
and
--
now
we
agree
that
if
the
purpose
of
these
questions
was
to
ask
mr.
yates
whether
or
not
she
knew
any
communists
at
all
that
all
these
questions
were
really
in
effect
a
single
question,
but
that
was
not
the
purpose
of
these
questions.
each
of
these,
each
of
these
questions
insofar
as
they
are
related
to
a
different
person
had
value
in
itself
and
therefore
there
were
as
many
contempts
as
there
were
persons
who
were
the
objects
of
the
questions.
now
with
this
one
qualification,
five
of
these
questions
dealt
with
codefendants
of
mrs.
yates
who
had
rested
their
cases.
now
mrs.
yates
said
from
the
beginning
and
consistently
maintained
throughout
the
two-day
period
that
she
would
not
identify
any
of
her
codefendants
who
had
not
rested
their
cases
as
communists.
now
in
view
of
the
fact
that
she
was
consistent
in
that
position,
we
believe
at
least
we
shall
assume
for
argument
that
the
multiple
questions
dealing
with
these
several
codefendants
were
in
effect
one.
but
there
were
also
these
other
people
about
whom
she
was
questioned,
who
were
not
codefendants
and
she
answered
these
questions
on
a
person
by
person
basis.
some
of
the
persons
she
answered
about.
she
answered
about
a
peson
named
mike
quinn.
she
answered
about
a
person
named
carl
winter
who
was
one
of
the
–
her
--
one
of
the
named
but
unindicted
coconspirators.
he
was
one
of
the
smith
act
defendant
–
the
dennis
defendant.
she
named
william
z
foster.
she
named
a
person
named
sam
darcy
who
was
a
former
communist
who
had
been
expelled
and
the
rationalization
that
she
presented
to
the
court
and
to
the
prosecutor
as
to
why
she
was
asking,
why
should
answer
some
of
these
questions
and
not
others
was
this.
“i
will
answer
any
questions
that
you
ask
me
as
long
as
in
my
opinion,
my
identification
of
him
as
a
member
of
the
party
cannot
hurt
him
or
any
member
of
his
family.”
it
was
specifically
pointed
out
to
her.
“how
mrs.
yates
can
you
hurt
someone
who
is
employed
by
the
party.”
and
she
acknowledged,
“you
know,
well
it's
true
i
can't
hurt
him,
but
i
might
hurt
some
members
of
his
family.”
and
then
in
the
case
of
mike
quinn
she
said,
“well,
i
will
answer
about
mike
quinn.
he
is
dead.”
but
how
about
members
of,
how
about
members
of
mike
quinn's
family,
well
she
didn't
go
into
that.
the
net
effect
to
that
was
she
was
in
the
words
of
the
(inaudible)
case,
she
was
arrogating
onto
herself
the
function
of
a
judge.
she
was
going
to
decide
or
at
least
with
respect
to
these
questions
on
cross-examination,
she
was
going
to
decide
on
a
person
by
person
basis
which
person
she
would
answer
about
and
which
ones
she
would
not
answer
about.
now
for
that
reason
the
government
is
of
the
view
that
each
question
insofar
as
it
dealt
with
a
different
person,
with
the
exception
that
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago
about
codefendants,
forms
a
basis
of
a
separate
contempt.
now
by
the
basis
--
by
the
use
of
a
little
arithmetic
that
would
come
down
to
six
contempts,
two
committed
on
the
first
day
and
four
additional
ones
on
the
second
day.
now
since
petitioner
admits
that
all
you
need
is
two
to
establish
the
basis
--
to
make
the
criminal
sentence
valid,
that
if
my
reasoning
is
sound
that
proves
that
the
criminal
contempt
sentence
was
valid
on
the
independent
grounds
than
the
one
i
first
mentioned.
now
i
shall
like
to
come
to
the
petitioner's
second
point
namely
that
the
criminal
contempt
sentence
was
misconceived
because
the
purpose
of
a
sentence
was
not
punish
mrs.
yates,
but
really
to
coerce
her
and
to
give
an
answer,
into
giving
answers
for
the
benefit
of
the
government.
we
think
that
it
is
clear
from
reading
the
record
and
the
record
is
very
short
and
particularly
the
colloquy
between
the
judge
and
mrs.
yates
and
her
counsel
that
his
purpose
in
opposing
this
second
sentence,
this
criminal
sentence
of
june
30th
was
to
vindicate
the
authority
of
the
court.
he
used
that
expression
at
least
five
times
during
that
colloquy
and
that
is
the
characteristic
purpose
of
a
criminal
sentence.
now
it
is
true
that
he
does
speak
in
terms
of
i
had
hope,
he
said,
“i
had
hoped
mrs.
yates
would
have
purged
herself
by
now.”
but
it
is
clear
from
the
context
in
which
he
uses
that
expression
that
he
was
using
it
in
the
sense
of
i
had
hoped
that
she
would
by
now
have
bound
to
the
authority
of
the
court.
in
other
words
he
was
saying
that
he
had,
he
hoped
that
by
now
she
would
have
exhibited
some
repentance
and
contrition
for
her
refusal.
and
he
said
that
if
she
had
done
that,
he
would
take
that
into
consideration
in
reducing
the
sentence.
he
referred
specifically
to
rule
35(a)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
which
authorizes
a
court
within
60
days
after
the
imposition
of
a
criminal
sentence
to
reduce
it.
he
referred
to
that
specifically.
so
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
judge's
attitude
and
point
of
view
was
this.
this
is
a
criminal
sentence
but
you
have
it
within
your
power
by
answering
these
questions
and
thereby
exhibiting
a
repentance
and
contrition
that
you
bow
to
the
authority
of
the
court
and
i
will
take
that
into
consideration
in
reducing
your
sentence,
possibly
suspending,
possibly
suspending
it's
execution.
and
for
that
reason
we
think
that
there
was
no
merit
to
the
petitioner's
view,
contention
that
the
judge
really
didn't
know
what
he
was
doing
here,
that
he
was
really
that
--
they
admit
that
the
sentence
would
inform
a
criminal,
it
was
to
a
definite
period
which
is
the
hallmark
of
a
criminal
sentence.
but
they
say
that
the
judge
didn't
really
know
what
he
was
doing,
what
he
really
had
in
mind
was
trying
to
coerce
her
into
giving
these
answers
for
the
benefit
of
the
government.
in
the
colloquy
it
was
pointed
out
to
him
that
it
was
too
late
to
give
these
answers.
the
trial
was
over
and
he
recognized
that.
he
said
--
he
said
i
recognize
the
fact
that
it's
too
late
for
the
trial
but
she
can
still
answer
the
questions
and
thereby
bow
to
the
authority
of
the
court.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well
it
would
have
no
effect
whatever
on
it
sir.
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
missed
the
point
of
your
honor's
question.
the
effect
would
be
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
the
contempt
sentence
would
begin
immediately
i
take
it.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
don't
follow
your
honor
there.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
no
i
am
saying
that
this
criminal
contempt
sentence
will
moot
become
regardless
of
what
happens
at
her
second
trial.
the
only
thing
that
might
happen
would
be
that
if
she
is
acquitted
at
her
second
trial,
then
her
criminal
contempt
sentence
in
this
case
would
begin
to
run
immediately
because
there
would
be
nothing
--
there
would
be
no
other
sentence
on
which
it
would
be
tacked
on
to.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well
it
is
true
that
that
the
--
at
least
now
in
terms
of
beginning
to
run
at
the
end
of
the
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well
that
is
on
the
assumption
that
she
is
going
to
serve,
right.
i
am
sure
that
that's
the
--
what
that
means
that
it
will
begin
to
run
when
that,
when
that
sentence
is.
but
that's
on
the
presumption
that
she
--
on
the
assumption
that
she
is
going
to
serve
it.
of
course
she
does
not
have
to
serve
it
because
she
is
acquitted
at
a
second
trial,
well
it
won't
be
tacked
on
to
anything
and
so
therefore
will
begin
immediately.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well
it
would
still
begin
at
the
end
of
her,
of
her
–
oh
i
see
what
you
mean.
i
think
that
a
reasonable
reading
of
the
way
that
sentence
--
the
sentence
in
this
case
reads
is
that
it
will
begin
to
run
at
the
end
of
her
sentence
of
on
the
main,
but
of
course
that's
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
that's
been
dictated
now.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
that's,
that's
a
nice
question.
frankly
it
did
not
occur
to
me
but
i
don't
think
that
it
had,
i'd
like
to
think
about
that
some
more,
i
don't
think
it
is
pertinent
to
this
case.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
oh
no,
i
don't
think
they
had
any
intention
of
whatsoever
about
what
it's
all
about.
that's
an
ordinary,
i
mean
that's
the
way
many
sentences
read,
it
will
begin
to
run
at
the
end
of
some
other
sentence.
now
it
often
happens
that
another
sentence
is
washed
out,
but
that
doesn't
wash
out
the
sentence
which
is
going
to
begin
to
run
it,
which
was
designated
to
begin
to
run.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
don't
read
the
terms
of
this
specific
order
as
being
unique
on
this
respect.
i
think
this
is
a
--
it
just
says
it
going
to
begin
to
run
at
the
end
of
some
other
sentence,
is
it
not
sir
and
for
that
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well
i
think
there
are
either
one
of
two
possibilities;
one
because
that
original
smith
act
sentence
has
been
washed
out
at
least
as
of
now,
it
could
be
that
she
will
be
required
to
serve
the
sentence
in
this
case
immediately
assuming
that
is
affirmed
by
this
court
because
the
sentence
under
which
it
was
added
just
no
longer
is
as
of
now.
om
the
other
hand
a
possibly
resonable
reading
of
that
would
be
that
the
judge
will
because
it
was
with
intent
to
make
that
sentence
run
after
the
smith
act
sentence,
he
might
decide
to
wait
and
see
what
happens
at
the
second
trial
and
if
she
is
again
convicted
then
make
this
one
run
consecutively
to
that
future,
possibly
future
sentence.
but
in
no
case,
i
am
sure
in
no
case,
would
a
reasonable
reading
of
that
sentence
means
that
it
might
be
washed
out
entirely.
there
will
be
some
question
as
to
when
it
will
begin
to
run.
i
now
come
to
the
final
contention
of
the
petitioner
that
the
sentence
is
excessive.
now
the
argument
is
as
i
follow
it
that
she
acted
out
of
good
faith
here
pure
motives,
she
didn't
want
to
be
an
informer
and
therefore
one
year
was
excessive.
i
would
like
to
present
to
your
honors'
attention
that
the
good
faith
with
which
a
person
refuses
to
obey
a
valid
order
is
not
a
relevant
consideration.
such
a
view
if
it
is
found
that
is,
that
is
relevant
would
certainly
have,
would
certainly
have
wide
radiations.
it
would
not
be
limited
to
contempt
cases.
it
would
apply
to
the
consciences
objector
to
military
service
whose
conscience
compels
him
not
only
not
to
bear
arms,
but
not
to
answer
his
graphical,
not
to
fill
out
a
questionnaire.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
think
it
went
back
–
(inaudible)
before,
i
say
an
obstruction
was
not
necessary,
but
there
was
an
obstruction
here.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
but
the
point
is
her
good
faith
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
whether
there
was
an
obstruction
or
not.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well
i
--
for
present
purposes
i
would
like
to
assume
that
there
has
to
be
an
obstruction,
but
my
point
now
is
that
the
good
faith
of
the
defendant
is
not
a
relevant
consideration.
whether
or
not
her
conscience
dictates
this,
she
obstruct
the
justice
--
that
she
obstruct
the
proceedings
is
not
relevant.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
in
all
criminal
cases
except
contempt
cases
at
a
jury
trial,
but
with
due
respect,
with
all
respect
sir,
i
don't
think
that's
relevant
to
this
present
consideration.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
am
saying
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
no,
i
am
merely
saying
that
if
the,
if
the
petitioner
is
good
faith
which
i
am
now
assuming
was
an
answer
to
this
contempt
charge
that
there
is
no
reason
why
that
rule
of
law
should
be
limited
to
contempt
cases.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it
should
be,
it
should
apply
to
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it
should
apply
to
all
criminal
law
and
it
would
apply
to
the
person
whose
conscience
tells
him
that
he
must
steal
from
the
rich
and
give
to
the
poor,
or
it
would
even
apply
to
a
person
who
believed
that
it
was
conscientious
duty
to
assassinate
the
persons
who
wield
the
authority
of
the
state.
there
was
no
reason
for
limiting
that
that
contention
to
contempt
cases
and
therefore
i
say
that
argument
has
wide
radiations
and
i,
with
all
due
respect,
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is
sound.
now
was
one
year
too
long?
well
then
how
long
was
too
long?
suppose
if
it
is
taking
place
before
a
committee
of
congress
i
don't
suppose
it
would
be
here,
but
if
this
took
place
be
a
committee
of
congress
because
the
contempt
of
congress
statute
authorizes
a
one
year
sentence.
not
only
does
it
authorize
a
one
year
sentence,
it
makes
a
one
month
sentence
mandatory,
a
minimum
of
one
month,
minimum
of
one
month
and
a
maximum
of
a
year
for
contempt
of
congress.
and
that
is
not
all,
but
in
addition
there
is
a
mandatory
fining
requirement
of
not
less
than
one
hundred
nor
more
than
$1000.
here
the
defendant
got
a
one
year
sentence
and
no
fine
because
no
fine
was
possible
for
a
contempt
of
the
court.
now
is
a
court
supposed
to
be
more
restricted,
should
be
more
restricted
in
punishing
the
contempts
of
itself
than
are
the
congressional
committees.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
and
you
assume
that
they
were
separate
contempts?
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
all
right,
it
is
one
of
my
contentions
that
there
were
four
contempts
committed
upon
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
he
found
her
guilty
of
eleven--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
now
i
think
that
i
have
to
make
a
number
of
distinctions
here.
three
of
these
11
questions
all
dealt
with
one
person.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
that's
what
i
wanted
to
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
yes.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
think
that
would
present
pretty
closely,
pretty
much
the
same
question,
as
if
he
sentenced
her
to
11
years
on
each
count
to
run
concurrently.
in
other
words,
what
i'm
saying
to
your
honor
is
this,
that
there
comes
a
point
where
an
appellate
court
was
saying
this
is
an
abuse
of
discretion,
too
long.
now
where
that
point
is,
it's
not
for
me
to
say,
it's
for
an
appellate
court
to
say.
it's
for
this
court
to
say
whether
one
year
was
too
long,
just
as
it
would
be
for
this
court
to
say
whether
11
years
would
be
too
long,
but
i
can't
say
anything
more
than
it
is
possible
for
a
judge
to
abuse
his
discretion
but
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
whether
he
abused
his
discretion
by
taking
in
a
year
for
each
one
and
making
it
consecutive
or
giving
ten
years
for
each
and
making
it
concurrent.
it's
the
total
length
of
the
sentence
which
would
be
the
relevant
consideration
in
determining
whether
or
not
there
had
been
an
abuse
of
discretion.
does
that
answer
your
honor's
question?
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
now
i
readily
concede
that
it's
within
the
power
of
this
court
in
its
supervisory
powers
over
the
lower
courts
to
reduce
this
sentence.
i'm
also
suggesting
that
there
is
no
necessity
to
do
it,
i
don't
think
that
one
year
is
too
long,
but
there
is
no
question,
especially
under
the
united
mine
workers
decision,
that
the
court
has
the
power
if
it
thinks
it
was
too
long.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
got
five
years
on
the
main
case.
now,
i
think
that
an
important
factor
that
this
court
should
keep
in
mind
in
weighing,
in
evaluating
or
determining
whether
or
not
one
year
was
too
long,
was
the
fact
that
her
refusal,
although
they
were
purported
to
be
the
result
of
conscientious
approval
were
deliberate
and
persistent,
and
she
continued
in
it
after
every
invitation
was
held
out
to
her
to
answer
the
questions
and
moreover
and
i
think
this
is
equally
important,
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
crime
of
someone
like
costello
who
says
i
won't
answer
any
questions,
is
more
serious
than
the
offense
of
mrs.
yates,
perhaps
that
is
true.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
mrs.
yates'
offence
would
have
been
less
if
she
just
had
said,
mr.
prosecutor
i'm
not
going
to
answer
any
of
your
questions,
i
think
that
would
have
been
a
more
serious
offense
than
the
offense
that
she
committed.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
but
that
might
be
a
more
serious
offense,
and
it
would
be
i
think,
a
more
serious
offense
than
the
one
she
committed
and
she
might
subject
herself
to
a
longer
prison
sentence
for
that.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
--
i
mean
the
difference
between
the
costello
case
and
this
case
really
has
relevance
to
how
many
offenses,
how
many
contempts
were
committed,
but
it
does
not
follow
that
because
a
person
only
committed
one
contempt
and
not
five
or
six;
that,
that
one
contempt
was
less
serious
than
the
five
or
six,
but
my
final
point
is
this,
that
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
two,
one
on
each
day,
but
you
know
remember
the
facts
of
the
costello
case,
he
was
a
witness
on
two
separate
days
and
on
each
day
he
refused
to
answer
questions
under
different
circumstances.
there
was
something
about
the
doctor's
certificates
and
there
was
--
in
anyway
it
was
undisputed
that
there
were
at
least
two
offences,
but
the
court
said
only
two.
the
offense
of
each
day
could
not
be
proliferated
by
continuing
to
answer
costello
questions
and
we
except
that
principle,
i
think
that's
sound,
but
that's
not
this
case.
but
my
final
point
is
that
mrs.
yates
by
picking
and
choosing
the
questions
that
she
would
answer,
in
the
words
of
the
(inaudible)
case,
she
determined
what
testimony
to
give
and
what
to
withhold,
and
thereby
she
transferred
from
the
court
to
the
witness,
the
management
of
the
trial.
i
think
that,
that
is
an
important
factor
for
this
court
to
keep
in
mind
in
determining
whether
or
not
one
year
was
too
long.
in
gompers
against
bucks
stove
&
range
company,
this
court
said
through
mr.
justice
lamar
speaking
for
unanimous
court,
if
a
party
can
make
himself
a
judge
of
the
validity
of
orders
which
have
been
issued
and
by
his
own
act
of
disobedience
set
them
aside,
then
are
the
courts
impotent
and
what
the
constitution
now
fittingly
calls
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
would
be
a
mere
mockery.
for
all
these
reasons
the
government
submits
the
sentences
are
valid
and
that
the
one
year
sentence
while
reducible
by
this
court,
in
its
opinion
it
is
too
long,
was
within
the
range
of
a
sound
judicial
discretion.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
believe
i
have
a
couple
of
minutes.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
may
it
please
the
court.
the
chief
justice
asked
a
question
of
my
opponent.
if
there
--
he
had
been
able
to
find
any
cases
where
a
judge
attempted
to
punish
both
civilly
and
criminally
on
whether
these
cases
said
that
it
must
happen
at
the
same
time
(inaudible).
the
yates
decision,
the
reversal
of
the
three
year
sentence
in
this
case
which
is
reported
at
227
f.2d
848
says
just
that.
the
judge
had
put
her
in
jail
civilly
where
she
remained
for
43
days
and
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
he
said
i
now
treat
this
as
criminal
and
i'm
going
to
sentence
you
the
three
years
and
the
court
reversed
on
the
exact
basis,
that
it
was
a
denial
of
due
process
for
the
court
to
punish
civilly
and
then
without
giving
her
warning
at
that
time,
that
he
still
held
it
within
his
power,
he
still
intended
to
do
something
criminally
about
it,
because
and
this
is
logical,
because
if
a
witness
knew
at
the
time
that
he
was
being
committed
civilly,
that
there
was
a
possibility
of
a
criminal
sentence
for
the
same
offence
it
might
make
an
awful
deal
of
difference
as
to
whether
or
not
that
witness
was
going
to
answer
that
question
or
not
at
that
time,
and
so
the
court
held
that
in
this
case,
this
very
case,
that
it
was
the
denial
of
due
process
to
wait
until
the
trial
was
over.
so
i
say
that
in
this
case
says,
when
he
first
committed
her
for
a
civil
contempt,
assuming
that
there
was
only
contempt,
it
was
then
a
denial
of
due
process
for
having
to
attempt
to
sentence
her
again
and
the
government
cannot
now
come
back
and
say
well
he
could
have
sentenced
her
both
civilly
and
criminally
and
we
can't
go
back
and
retry
what
the
judge
might
have
done,
because
he
tried
to
do
just
that
and
the
court
reversed
it.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes
and
that
was
the
question
which
i
understood
the
chief
justice
to
put
to
my
opponent,
whether
or
not
they
had
to
be
given
notice
of
that
time
and
the
case
held
that
because
she
wasn't
told
at
that
time
that
she
might
be
punished
criminally
for
the
same
offense,
it
was
a
denial
of
due
process
and
she
was
entitled
to
it.
and
in
my
final
minute
let
me
say
this
that
i
think
that
there
is
no
question
about
the
court
having
the
power
to
do
something
about
the
sentence
in
this
case
if
it
feels
that
the
sentence
was
excessive.
in
arguing
excessiveness
of
the
sentence,
i
do
not
waive
for
one
more,
my
honest
and
sincere
and
(inaudible)
belief
that
there
are
committed
in
this
case
which
requires
a
complete
reversal
of
this
conviction
without
regard
to
the
excessiveness,
but
failing
of
that
argument
i
think
that
in
on
the
basis
of
precedent,
the
fact
that
30
days
and
60
days
has
been
sufficient
in
every
other
case
of
this
kind,
to
vindicate
the
authority
of
the
court
that
it
was
certainly
a
very
great
abuse
of
discretion
and
it
is
shocking
to
the
conscience
that
the
court
would
give
a
year
in
this
case
after
she
had
already
spent
more
that
70
days
in
jail.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
repeat
the
comment
that,
that
was
an
interesting
question.
i
think
that
perhaps
if
you
affirm
this
conviction,
one
of
two
things
is
possible
and
i
don't
know
the
exact
answer
to
it.
it
maybe
that
the
business
of
sentence
is
purely
an
administrative
process
and
that
the
case
could
go
back
to
the
trial
court
for
a
correction
of
the
sentence
from
the
standpoint
of
when
it
is
to
permit
because
it
maybe
that
you
can
argument
that
this
is
purely
an
administrative
action.
on
the
other
hand
it
maybe
that
this
is
such
an
integral
part
of
the
judgment,
that
because
of
the
fact
that
there
was
reversal
in
the
main
case,
that
the
contempt
case
falls
with
the
main
case,
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
which
of
those
alternatives
is
the
correct
one.
