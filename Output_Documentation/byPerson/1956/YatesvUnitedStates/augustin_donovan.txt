mr.
augustin
donovan
your
honors
please.
in
our
opening
brief
and
prior
thereto
on
over
a
period
of
months,
we
made
a
very,
very
meticulous
examination
of
this
record,
last
came.
each
and
every
possible
bit
of
evidence
in
a
voluminous
record
that
it
could
or
did
by
inference
or
otherwise
applied
to
our
particular
petitioners,
richmond
and
connelly.
richmond
was
the
editor
in
san
francisco
of
the
daily
people's
world
and
connelly
the
editor
of
the
daily
people's
world
in
los
angeles.
they
are
members
of
the
communist
party
and
have
been
for
many
years.
and
they
as
such
have
been
minor
officials
here
and
there.
the
newspaper,
both
editions
are
the
sponsored
papers
of
the
communist
party
in
california.
now,
we
did
in
our
opening
brief,
set
forth
everything
that
we
could
possibly
find
in
this
record
and
i'm
sure
we
got
it
all
because
the
government
found
no
difficulty
except
the
few
cases,
where
few
spots
where
we
will
show
that,
a
sort
of
it
reflects
more
the
other
way,
that
we
stated
and
discuss
in
detail,
all
of
the
possible
and
tenable
inferences
that
might
come
or
arise,
or
would
have
attack
or
approach
any
legal
mind
from
the
evidence
of
what
they
said,
did
or
wrote.
it
is
admitted
by
the
government,
on
page
112
of
its
brief,
did
not
one
word
in
the
newspaper
ever
advocated
or
innovated
any
advocacy
of
violence
whatsoever.
we
contend
that
not
one
bid
evidence
will
respect
to
these
two
many
in
anyway,
in
first,
violence
or
advocacy.
the
only
thing
you
can
say
about
these
men
is,
they
are
members
of
the
communist
party,
they
have
been
members
of
the
communist
party
for
many
years.
there
is
not
one
item
or
evidence
in
these
whole
records,
showing
any
act,
deed,
word
written
or
spoken
by
them
in
any
manner,
shape
or
form
can
be
labored
into
an
advocacy
of
violence.
on
the
contrary,
on
the
contrary,
they
wrote
in
their
newspaper
matters
concerning
the
taft-hartley
act,
labored
bills,
the
recognition
of
colored
people's
rights,
the
recognition
of
mexican-americans,
the
things
that
are
matters
of
public
consequence
and
interest.
sometimes
they
are
on
the
minor
side.
i
do
not
believe
that
is
a
crime
to
be
on
the
short
side
of
the
things
and
be
a
sorry
day
in
america
when
the
only
safe
place
in
the
world
is
on
bandwagon.
and
it
seems
to
me,
that
outside
of
the
general
idea
that
they
were
members
of
the
communist
party.
and
that
the
communist
party
proclaimed
that
was
based
on
marxism-leninism,
there
is
literally
nothing
in
this
record
with
respect
to
these
defendant.
now
then,
communism
as
to
be
a
member
of
the
party,
i
assumed
from
the
discussion
is
not
primeval.
now
then,
the
question
then
becomes,
if
you
construed
marxism-leninism,
in
what
way
did
you
construe
it?
it
is
capable
as
the
record
shows
of
many
types
of
construction.
some
of
them
innocents
and
void
of
any
invalidity
or
any
force
of
violence,
you
might
say
that
when
you
take
these
books
applying
to
another
country,
in
another
year,
almost
a
century
ago,
that
could
be
interpretative
in
various
ways,
to
select
from
that
and
take
all
of
its
context
certain
thoughts
and
ignore
others,
and
put
them
in
the
united
states
of
50
or
60
years
later
and
put
them
in
the
mind
of
somebody
who
said
nothing
and
does
nothing
to
in
the
case
interpretation,
you
are
going
along
way
to
create
a
case.
you
are
making
a
criminal
case,
you
are
not
insisting
on
the
tenable
evidence
rule.
that
if
rule
is
consider
--
that
rule
should
be,
i
believe
that
is,
we
have
discussed
that
fully
in
our
brief,
that
if
the
evidences
consisted
with
innocence
or
are
tenable
inference
of
innocence,
can
be
drawn
from
the
evidence
as
you
go
from
once
place
along
when
the
guy
got
county,
testing
it
out,
here
then
and
the
other.
if
inferences
of
innocence
can
be
interpreted
in
to
each
act,
then
you
should
never
give
in
that
case
to
jury
for
a
guessing
contest
in
these
inflammatory
times,
in
the
case
of
that
time,
with
all
the
atmosphere
that
existed
at
the
time.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
record
shows
that
these
two
petitioners,
as
we
analyze
it
tonight,
would
do
wish
a
very
careful
reading
about
briefs
because
we
have
intended
to
analyze
every
conceivable
inference
that
could
be
drawn
from
the
various
testimony.
and
in
any
matter
either,
directly
or
indirectly
reflects
upon
our
two
defendants.
and
i
believe
you
will
ask
to
change
and
come
to
the
conclusion,
that
from
that
record,
and
in
each
instance
and
each
reference
to
us,
the
tenable
inference
of
innocence
from
any
sort
of
things
such
as
the
conspiracy,
can
be
concluded.
and
having
that
in
mind,
it
seems
to
me
it
was
the
duty
of
the
trial
court,
not
to
present
this
to
a
jury
of
the
law
under
any
conditions.
and
to
permit
them
to
speculate
on
a
set
of
facts
or
set
of
evidence
of
that
kind
of
character.
now
then,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
of
this
case,
that
either
petitioner
richmond,
petitioner
connelly,
and
were
expressly
advocated
violent
overthrow
of
our
government.
there
is
no
evidence
of
either
of
them
ever
said
anything
construable
as
advocacy
of
violent
overthrow.
putting
aside
the
question,
whether
doctrine
or
marxism-leninism
or
in
any
sense
equitable
with
advocacy
of
force
and
violence,
there
is
no
evidence
connecting
either
petitioner
with
the
study,
teaching
or
advocacy
of
marxism-leninism.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
either
petitioner
was
present
at
any
meeting
or
anyone
else
expressly
advocated
forceful
overthrow
of
the
government,
or
said
anything
interpretable
as
so
advocating
or
thought
studied
or
are
advocated
the
doctrines
of
marxism-leninism.
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
daily
people's
world,
the
newspaper
would
which
petition
were
connected,
ever
contained
one
word,
either
express
or
implied
advocating
brought
of
revolution.
of
that,
if
this
record
is
carefully
analyzed,
with
respect
to
the
fact,
that
this
is
a
criminal
procedure.
and
this
is
a
type
of
a
case,
that
all
know
it,
we
have
no
such
thing
as
a
changer,
it
is
a
changer.
and
finding
of
guilt
goes
to
the
third
generation
of
this
type
of
case.
no
case
requires
greater
chair,
with
respect
to
the
evidence.
and
no
case
requires
a
higher
responsibility
to
keep
from
a
jury,
possible
going
to
speculate
on
the
set
of
facts,
if
the
facts
are
such
that
tenable
inferences
of
innocence
can
be
drawn.
there
are
as
the
great
duty
of
the
trial
judge.
this
case
should
never
have
gone
to
this
jury,
particularly
under
those
particular
circumstances.
in
the
1945,
and
again
in
‘48,
and
i
believe,
clearly
within
the
statute
or
beyond
the
statutes
limitations,
because
it
was
not
‘48
indictment
here
with
brought
in
about
the
last
day
of
two
of
730,
51.
so,
we
assume
it
was
in
'48
prior
to
the
beginning
of
the
three
year
period.
the
constitutional
of
the
party
of
the
communist
party
was
adopted
in
1945.

again
in
'48,
something
along
the
same
line,
again
two,
section
3
and
section
9,
can
be
found
on
page
47
of
mr.
margolis
brief,
it
negates
in
to
this
case.
now,
there
is
nothing
here
in
this
record,
to
show
that
richmond
and
connelly,
did
not
accept
that
on
its
based
value.
there
is
no
evidence
here
if
that
was
me
or
sham
or
pre
chance,
nothing
of
the
kind.
it
almost
have
to
go
to
the
same
sort
of
reasoning
that
the
boss
had
when
he
called
perkins
in.
perkins
came
in
to
the
boss's
big
office.
the
carpets
were
very
deep.
but
perkins
walked
there
and
very
subserviently
stood
at
the
desk.
the
boss
says,
perkins,
you
have
been
with
us
30
years.
you
have
done
everything
perfectly.
you
have
never
been
late.
you
have
never
asked
for
overtime.
you
even
come
here
on
your
vacations
and
works.
you
are
accounts
are
perfect.
perkins,
what
in
the
world
are
you
up
to
anything?
and
that
sort
of
mind,
and
that
sort
of
attempt,
that
viewing
this
evidence,
that
brings
these
laborite
conclusions.
these
conclusions
are
equally
text
out
of
the
air.
to
say
that,
this
man
intended
certain
things
particularly
with
the
limitation
was
placed
in
the
dennis
case
as
speedily
as
circumstances
would
permit,
is
just
to
walk
the
evidence
out
of
all
recognition.
it
is
a
labored
attempt
to
merely
say,
communist
party,
marxism-leninism,
you
are
guilty.
there
isn't
anything
else
here
if
you
guilt
the
real
responsible,
cheerful,
scrutinizing,
screaming
in
the
--
check
up
on
what
is
the
rule
in
criminal
cases
for
the
accomplishment
of
a
house
of
guilt.
this
is
a
house
of
guilt
fills
on
the
foundation
of
sand.
it
is
a
series
of
continuous,
tenuous,
constructions
built
one
up
on
the
other.
assuming
certain
things
in
fair
or
facts,
which
are
merely
inferences
from
no
facts
and
going
round
and
round
and
round
as
our
brief
well
outlined?
these
men
surely
our
members
of
the
party.
surely,
the
party
was
for
marxism-leninism,
but
there
you
stop
too
also
surely,
marxism-leninism
has
many
constructions.
as
to
place,
geography,
type,
kind,
what
happen?
you
betake
the
file
if
you
want
to,
and
you
can
find
plenty
of
things
from
the
bible
too.
and
if
you
want
to
state
it
because
of
man,
believes
in
the
bible,
that
you
could
not
narrow
that
context,
take
a
war
or
attempted
war,
or
the
various
thing
the
bible
tells
us
practically
everything,
you
could
do
equally
well.
but
when
you
are
dealing
with
the
security,
the
liberty,
the
life,
the
status,
the
condition
of
these
men
and
all
the
children
relations
and
--
what
have
you?
we
have
to
get
to
a
pretty
serious
test
of
what
is
the
criminal
will
claim
for
good
evidence.
and
where
is
the
judge
of
the
trial
court,
stepping
and
prevent
the
juries
to
go
above
the
matter
of
pure
speculations.
i
have
some
time
later
for
a
bottom,
i
believe
i
have
covered
most
of
the
matter
i
had
in
mind.
there
was
--
we
were
criticized
some
what
in
the
brief
of
the
respondents,
with
respect
having
overlooked
or
insinuated.
there
is
something
with
respect
to
the
evidence.
we
find
an
examination
that,
one
of
our
insinuations
was
a
very
unfortunate
one.
we
call
attention
to
the
fact,
that
one
of
the
informal
witnesses
of
the
prosecution,
have
testified
--
i
think
it
was
connelly
was
present
at
the
witness,
we
just
call
attention
to
the
fact,
that
connelly's
record
showed
he
was
in
europe
at
the
time.
he
is
a
certified
before
the
(inaudible)
another
was
that
apparently
connelly,
it
was
testified
that
connelly
had
gone
up
in
an
elevator.
about
half
a
dozen
times
in
three
years
of
the
seventh
floor,
where
there
was
a
headquarters
of
the
communist
party
in
san
francisco.
at
then
--
from
that
testimony
alone,
we
have
the
government
saying,
that
he
went
there
at
night,
that
he
went
at
the
night
some
particular
means.
and
it
was
on
the
list,
there
is
no
such
evidence
whatsoever
of
any
one
of
those
evidence.
so,
we
do
fill
that,
probably
we
are
appropriate
in
making
our
allusions
to
the
insufficiencies
of
the
evidence.
now,
the
government
has
answered
here
some
four
pages
with
the
respect
of
richmond
and
connelly,
nothing
more
than
a
recitation
of
generally,
the
same
old
generally.
it
was
the
member
of
the
party,
it
was
there
three
years,
he
belongs
at
the
party,
he
was
an
officer
here,
he
was
an
officer
there.
but
not
one
word,
have
may
admit
that
not
one
word
of
advocacy
of
violence
ever
appeared
on
the
newspaper
of
these
two
editors.
all
that
could
be
so
in
firm.
and
they
admit
also,
by
their
fail,
to
state
in
anyway,
any
portion
of
the
evidence
that
would
indicate
either
that
we
intended
to
be
violent,
advocated
violence,
ever
said
anything
or
did
anything
of
a
violent
character
or
could
be
so
construed.
it
seems
to
me
your
honors
that
the
question
of
the
character,
the
texture,
the
substance
of
this
particular
record,
with
respect
to
these
particular
petitioners,
is
of
such
character
that
it
should
never
have
gone
to
the
jury.
mr.
augustin
donovan
your
honors
please.
with
respect
to
the
question
concerning
that
double
question
of
the
court,
i
wanted
to
read
this
that
occurred
later
on
in
the
record
after
the
colloquy
that
was
referred
to
when
they
were
discussing,
the
one
or
two
question
matter.
and
i
read
from
the
record
at
page
13,721
and
that
is
volume
26.
the
court
“i
won't
ask
them
that,
i
would
ask
them
to
answer
if
any
of
them
feel
or
if
any
of
them
happened
to
have
heard
something
or
seen
something
which
has
affected
them.
and
they
feel
it
might
affect
their
ability
to
serve
with
absolute
impartiality
as
a
jury
if
they
so
feel
to
stand
up
and
say
so
but
you
must
appreciate
that
this
is
a
very
delicate
situation.
i
would
only
do
it
as
i
say
if
the
defense
urged
it.
mr.
schullman
we
are
urging,
except
we
are
urging
it
to
be
done
in
this
fashion,
your
honor.
i
mean
i
am
not
talking
about
phraseology.
we
are
urging
it
to
be
done
in
a
fashion
so
at
least
we
have
two
concrete
questions
that
occurred
later
on
in
the
record
after
the
colloquia
referred
to
default.”
now,
if
your
honors
pleased
with
respect
to
the
last
question
addressed
to
justice
frankfurter
by
mr.
margolis
and
the
court
asked
the
question.
i
believe
that
our
two
petitioners
at
a
stage,
long
before
there
were
any
instructions,
should
have
been
dismissed
from
this
case.
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
evidence
that
added
them
in
as
conspirators.
and
i
believe
a
very
careful
analysis
of
our
brief
which
takes
up
every
single
item
and
goes
into
every
inference
as
i
said
yesterday
and
shows
the
tenable
inferences
of
absolute
innocence
all
the
way
along
the
line
that
at
that
time,
the
trial
court
should
have
been
acted
and
dismissed.
and
i
believe
if
the
record
shows
that
that
then
this
court
should
do
what
the
trial
court
should
have
done
under
the
record
that
was
presented.
irrespective
of
whether
or
not
it
is
an
unusual
matter,
i
believe,
that
the
justice
required
that
where
the
evidence
in
a
criminal
case
is
not
sufficient,
the
tenable
inferences
of
innocence
all
the
way
along
the
line
and
not
anyone
other
inference
that
could
be
drawn
that
then
at
that
time
the
case
should
have
been
dismissed
as
to
these
particular
petitioners.
and
if
this
court,
if
it
sees
it
that
way
that
they
should
also
follow
the
rule
and
--
and
order
a
dismissal
as
to
our
petitioners.
i'm
speaking
only
as
to
our
petitioners
because
of
this
voluminous
record,
we
have
limited
our
research
and
our
checking
to
the
evidence
that
particularly
refers
to
us.
we
find
out
from
the
answer
of
the
respondent
that
there's
very
little
disagreement
in
our
analysis
of
that
evidence.
i
was
just
told
that
by
mr.
monahan
that
he
agrees
with
us
on
the
connelly
elevator
the
deal.
connelly
went
up
in
the
elevator
three
times
in
three
years
or
six
times
in
three
years
and
has
no
record
of
being
on
any
list.
there
is
no
record
of
whether
he
went
in
morning,
noon
or
night
and
there's
no
record
if
there
was
any
meeting
at
the
time
he
went
up.
and
that
we
contended
for
in
our
answer
and
mr.
monahan
has
conceded
that
that's
accurate.
mr.
augustin
donovan
he
is
--
he
acted
as
--
the
paper
responses
by
the
communist
party.
it
is
the
sponsored
communist
party
paper
both
in
los
angeles
and
san
francisco.
mr.
augustin
donovan
well,
whoever
the
appropriate
person
is
i
don't
happen
to
be
able
to
answer
that
question
justice
harlan.
mr.
augustin
donovan
yes.
i
don't
believe
there's
any
evidence
as
mr.
--
i
hadn't
any
evidence
of
how
we
came
into
the
existence
of
position
of
the
judge.
however,
the
invalidity
of
the
testimony
as
analyzed
in
our
brief
stands
out.
now
then,
does
it
mean
in
this
case
that
when
you
join
a
club,
you
write
a
blank
check
on
everything,
anybody
in
the
club
did
or
might
do
or
what
the
founding
fathers
of
the
club
might
have
done
or
what
they
might
have
written.
it's
getting
far
--
far
field
when
minds
search
for
its
thoughts
of
that
kind
and
were
found
guilty
of
thoughts
by
virtue
of
the
use
of
the
conspiracy
system
of
trial
to
be
guilty
of
anything
that
somebody
else
might
or
did
not
think,
despite
the
fact
that
all
of
our
conduct
points
directly
to
the
opposite,
everything
we
wrote
in
our
paper.
it's
admitted
in
the
brief
on
page
112
that
there's
nothing
in
the
paper
that
divide
(inaudible)
possibility
was
advocate
--
advocated
violence
or
the
like.
now,
nothing
that
they
did,
as
we
outlined
in
our
brief,
nothing
that
they
said,
nothing
was
said
in
their
presence.
where
in
the
world
do
we
go
with
this
conspiracy
charge,
must
we
write
a
blank
check
on
everybody
we
know
or
belongs
to
our
club
or
organization?
mr.
augustin
donovan
i
don't
believe
so
unless
it
was
brought
definitely
home
to
these
men
and
they
showed
the
intent.
mr.
augustin
donovan
yes.
mr.
augustin
donovan
yes.
mr.
augustin
donovan
well,
if
the
party
itself
was
without
question
and
clearly
in
favor
of
force
and
violence
and
a
man
knowing
that
showing
in
the
party
and
continued
in
the
party
with
that
idea
and
intent
--
mr.
augustin
donovan
pardon
me,
your
honor.
mr.
augustin
donovan
yes.
and
they
advocated
violence.
mr.
augustin
donovan
i
think
not
in
view
of
their
constitutional
provision
to
the
exact
--
to
the
exact
contrary.
in
1945,
the
one
that
i
read
yesterday
is
directly
to
the
opposite.
they
are
official
constitution.
in
1945,
they
set
forth
this
non-advocacy
of
any
type
of
violence
whatsoever.
in
1948,
they
added
two
provisions
to
--
to
the
same
tone
and
effect.
mr.
augustin
donovan
i
doubted
your
honor.
i
--
i
have
not
to
--
as
i
say
i
must
say
frankly,
that
i
have
not
analyzed
this
record
except
with
respect
to
my
two
petitions.
but
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
evidence
of
that
kind.
however,
i'm
saying
that
and
not
having
screened
at.
i
don't
want
to
be
sure
i'm
not
to
be
misunderstood.
now,
there
is
--
there
first
in
the
reply
brief
here
--
i
did
want
to
say
this.
there
was
one
question
concerning
instructions.
the
jury
was
out
six
days
and
six
nights
and
it
was
a
mixed
jury
i
ascertain
that.
i
was
not
at
the
trial.
i
didn't
engage
in
a
case
whatsoever
until
it
came
for
--
for
petitioner
--
mr.
augustin
donovan
six
days
and
six
nights
continuous.
mr.
augustin
donovan
you
would
know
that.
i
wouldn't
--
mr.
augustin
donovan
i
presumed
you
can
speculate
as
to
whether
or
not
the
instructions
were
clear
or
solve
from
the
length
of
time
that
they
were
out,
i
don't
know
whether
that's
appropriate
enough.
now,
the
analysis
of
the
evidence,
we
find
nothing
either
in
the
answer
of
respondent
or
in
his
argument
that
in
anyway
challenges
our
contentions
as
to
its
instability,
texture
of
sand,
lack
of
the
type
of
character
that
should
be
used
or
permitted
to
be
used
and
sent
to
a
jury
under
the
rules
of
the
criminal
law
with
respect
to
the
exclusion
of
reasonable
doubts
and
the
presumption
of
innocence
and
the
rule
that
tenable
testimony
of
innocence
prevents
them
to
be
--
entirely
all
the
way
through
would
prevent
the
case
from
being
sent
to
the
jury.
and
that
purpose,
i
believe,
that
long
before
these
instructions
or
any
of
these
other
things
came
up,
the
duty
then
lay
on
the
trial
court
to
dismiss
the
case
with
respect
to
us.
now
--
now,
in
the
dennis
case,
the
expression
as
--
that
we
intend
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence
as
speedily
as
circumstances
would
permit.
now,
that
doesn't
mean
we
just
intend
to
overthrow
the
government
with
force
and
violence.
let's
assume
its
arguendo
by
all
means
because
it
would
be
purely
hypothetical
with
respect
to
our
petitioners
and
i
think
any
other
petitioners
here.
however,
with
our
petitioners.
let's
assume
that
they
have
intent
to
advocate,
to
overthrow
the
government
on
force
and
violence.
how
are
we
going
to
equate
the
phrase
“as
speedily
as
circumstances
will
permit?”
does
that
mean
any
time,
years
hence
or
does
not
that
have
an
element,
an
import
of
immediacy?
the
word
“speedily”
suggests
immediacy.
it
might
--
maybe
if
they
said
if
passed
and
when,
it
wouldn't
mean
anything.
maybe
if
they
just
said
period,
then
if
you
had
it
anytime
in
the
future,
you
would
violate.
but
when
the
limitation
of
that
“speedily
as
circumstances”
would
permit,
is
placed
in
there,
it
means
something.
it
means
something
that
imports
immediacy.
now
it
also
gets
into
somewhat
the
--
mr.
augustin
donovan
no
--
no.
not
necessarily,
but
it
doesn't
mean
10,
20
years
from
now
or
whenever
you
might
get
the
idea.
it
doesn't
mean
it
passes
when
your
honor,
i
don't
believe.
i
believe
it
has
something
in
the
nature
of
pretty
soon
or
it
doesn't
mean
anything,
they
could
have
stop
with
the
period
and
never
put
that
clause
in
there
at
all.
if
they
had
just
intended
that
all
you
have
to
do
is
have
the
intent.
and
that
i
--
and
that
i
--
as
i
analyzed
the
case,
now,
of
course,
as
cases
go
along
here
undoubtedly
that
particular
phrase
in
the
dennis
case
will
be
given
action
and
will
eventually
be
set
forth
in
someway
that
will
probably
more
accurately
indicate
the
bounds
and
the
limits,
wherein
you
can
step
in
to
the
first
amendment
and
restrain
its
--
its
use.
mr.
augustin
donovan
oh,
is
it.
mr.
augustin
donovan
sorry.
mr.
augustin
donovan
yes.
mr.
augustin
donovan
yes.
