mr.
robert
w.
kenny
the
court
please.
i'm
the
man
who
argue
steinberg.
and
it
has
been
said
it's
well-known
that
mr.
schneiderman
was
here
before
and
the
last
time
he
was
here,
he
was
represented
by
mr.
wendell
willkie.
history
treated
me
rather
gently
because
back
in
1940,
i
lost
the
case
of
schneiderman
in
the
trial
court
and
mr.
willkie
took
it
one
in
this
court.
but
mr.
schneiderman
is
good
enough
to
let
me
have
one
more
chance
and
he's
let
me
argue
it
this
time.
i
don't
know
but
he
may
have
somebody
warming
up
in
case
the
case
comes
here
the
third
time
but
i
am
going
to
discuss
particularly
the
res
judicata
or
to
be
more
specifically
the
collateral
estoppel
point.
let's
think
first
what
was
litigated
before
in
the
schneiderman
case,
that
is
the
schneiderman
denaturalization
case
before
this
court
in
1943.
the
thing
that
was
litigated
before
was
schneiderman's
beliefs
on
the
crucial
issue
of
the
advocacy
of
force
and
violence
and
issues
before
were
did
communist
party
membership
equal
to
such
advocacy
into
that
this
court
said
no.
the
court
said
they
could
still
be
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
could
still
be
attach
to
the
constitution.
well
the
issue
was
could
he
advocate
the
doctrines
of
marxist-leninist,
marxism-leninism
according
to
his
interpretation
of
them
as
still
not
be
advocating
force
and
violence.
and
to
that
this
court
said,
“yes,
he
could
advocate
marxism-leninism
according
his
interpretation
and
he
could
be
still
be
attach
to
the
constitution.”
and
now
it's
because
this
court
said
and
there
this
is
the
language
of
the
tenable
conclusion
language
has
been
cited
so
many
times
thereafter.
this
court
held
then
a
tenable
conclusion
is
that
the
part
--
that
the
party
in
1927
desired
to
achieve
its
purpose
by
peaceful
and
democratic
means
and
as
a
theoretical
matter
justified
the
use
of
force
and
violence
only
as
a
method
of
preventing
an
attempted
forcible
counter
overthrow
once
the
party
had
obtained
control
in
a
peaceful
manner
or
as
a
matter
--
as
a
method
last
resort
to
enforce
the
majority
will
if
at
some
indefinite
time
in
the
future
because
peculiar
circumstances,
constitutional
or
peaceful
can't
offer
no
longer
open.
this
is
the
tenable
conclusion
the
court
said,
could
we
reach
out.
the
last
thing
is
what
was
the
evidence
in
the
first
schneiderman
case.
well
it
was
the
same
marxist-leninist
classics
that
the
government
has
relied
upon
the
present
case.
and
it
was
from
those
same
books
which
were
quoted
at
length
by
this
court
in
footnotes
in
the
original
schneiderman
case
that
this
court
was
able
to
adjudicate
this
tenable
conclusion
that
i've
just
read.
in
other
words
that
a
tenable
conclusion
that
schneiderman
was
not
advocating
force
and
violence
could
be
derived
from
these
--
these
--
the
same
books
which
were
the
evidence
again
in
this
case.
now
as
what
was
litigated
this
time.
this
time,
schneiderman's
intent
is
litigate
as
against
belief,
they're
both
states
in
mind.
and
it
was
his
intent
again
on
this
same
crucial
issue
of
the
advocacy
of
force
and
violence.
the
issues
this
time
where
did
his
membership
and
officership
in
the
communist
party
provide,
prove
ipso
facto
that
he
intended
to
advocate
force
and
violence,
and
did
his
advocacy
of
marxism-leninism
prove
that
he
indented
to
advocate
force
and
violence.
now
our
point
on
this
collateral
estoppels
as
we
say
that
on
those
issues,
schneiderman
was
protected
from
a
relitigation
by
his
government
unless
the
government
produced
proof
this
time
of
some
different
interpretation
by
him,
of
the
same
mold
marxist-leninist
books.
the
matter
that
was
litigated
before
and
on
which
point
schneiderman
won
before
was
that
his
circulation
of
these
books
would
not
have
advocacy
of
overthrow
by
force
and
violence.
and
thereafter
we
contend
that
as
long
as
he
merely
repeated
his
formal
conduct,
that
is
the
conduct
which
has
been
adjudicated
lawful
by
this
court
as
long
as
he
repeated
that
merely
repeated
that
conduct
he
was
protected
by
the
formal
decision.
however,
the
evidence
this
time
that
same
--
same
old
books,
and
the
books
which
have
been
litigated
once.
it's
true
in
the
government's
brief
they
talk
of
new
books
but
they're
glossed
over
and
they're
not
cited
because
the
really
violent
language,
it
was
ever
to
be
found
were
these
old
european
classics
and
the
books
that
have
been
written
since
1927,
are
more
on
the
side
of
the
tenable
conclusion
and
then
the
--
than
the
earlier
works
which
were
--
mr.
robert
w.
kenny
that's
what
i
--
it
didn't
occur
to
us.
it
might
be
an
interesting
--
mr.
robert
w.
kenny
i
think
that's
right.
i
don't
--
mr.
robert
w.
kenny
i
can't
--
mr.
robert
w.
kenny
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
kenny
i
thought
--
that
i
just
find
in
the
record
the
original
finding.
mr.
robert
w.
kenny
well,
we
--
we
would
contend
that
there
would
be
nothing
left
of
the
so-called
theoretical
discussion
of
the
use
of
force
and
violence.
mr.
robert
w.
kenny
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
kenny
yes.
that
--
mr.
robert
w.
kenny
we
contend
that
all
--
that
there
wouldn't
be
any
--
anything
left
that
is
if
you
cut
out,
what
has
been
litigated
before
in
schneiderman.
mr.
robert
w.
kenny
1943,
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
kenny
as
we
see
it,
mr.
schneiderman
is
like
the
man
who
was
discharged
in
the
insane
asylum.
he
had
a
--
said
--
this
says
i
am
sane
and
then
he
goes
on
and
say,
“i've
got
--
i've
got
a
certificate,
it
says,
i'm
sane,
where
is
yours?”
in
this
way,
the
way
we
feel
schneiderman,
he
was
--
his
conduct,
his
interpretation,
and
those
books
were
adjudicated.
there's
been
nothing
shown
in
this
record
that
he
has
ever
changed
his
position.
the
record
actually
show
things
like
this
that
one
man,
a
government
witness,
name
sander,
this
attempt
that
was
produced,
produced
by
the
government
and
he
said,
“yes
i
quit
the
communist
party”,
he
says
because
schneiderman
was
watering
down
marxism-leninism
and
that
i
want
to
bring
socialism
about
right
now,
and
schneiderman
is
ordering
it
down
i
quit.
the
government
also
introduced
a
--
an
exhibit
that
showed
that
schneiderman
--
mr.
robert
w.
kenny
he
fairly
saw
some
communism.
yes,
he
wanted
it
down
in
a
proper
figure.
and
other
time
--
another
exhibit
that
the
government
has
used
this
trial
is
where
schneiderman
and
mrs.yates
were
preparing
some
syllabus
for
class
studies
in
1949
and
they
quote
again
this
tenable
conclusion
language
quoted
with
approval,
and
this
is
the
language
they
were
using
to
indoctrinate.
this
very
thing
--
this
is
the
government
producing
against
it,
and
there
again
they
quote
the
language
of
this
court.
now
i
think
in
--
mr.
robert
w.
kenny
that's
right.
they
did.
mr.
robert
w.
kenny
that's
right.
mr.
robert
w.
kenny
well,
the
first
part
of
your
question,
mr.
justice
harlan
is
this.
the
--
the
--
we
don't
contend
that
this
court
ever
did,
ever
make
any
finding
one
way
or
the
other
and
hasn't
yet
as
to
a
connection
between
either
the
government.
i
think
the
various
times
would
like
to
contend
and
lower
courts
have
at
various
times
and
said
we'll
take
judicial
notice
that
the
communist
party
over
quote
advocates
force
and
violence.
we
don't
contend
that
that
was
decided
in
favor
of
the
communist
party
in
the
schneiderman
case
or
that
it
has
ever
been
decided
by
this
court
the
other
way.
that
--
that
question
is
on
the
court.
but
as
to
schneiderman,
his
--
the
question
was,
could
he,
by
his
interpretation
on
these
books,
the
same
books
that
are
used
against
him
here,
same
books
were
used
before,
could
he
by
his
--
did
he
by
his
interpretation
on
those
books
then
had
that
his
--
was
his
state
of
mind
demonstrative
of
the
belief
that
he
was
not
attached
to
the
constitution,
that
was
on
denaturalization.
on
this
trial,
the
question
was,
what
was
he
--
did
he
have
the
necessary
intent
to
overthrow
government
by
force
and
violence.
and
we
say
that
as
to
schneiderman,
he
has
this
personal
relationship.
he's
been
--
he
was
told
by
this
court.
i
think
it
was
excellent
language
of
--
quote.
quoted
many
times
about
how
the
change
of
the
political
temper
is
not
to
--
not
to
affect
his
--
his
conduct.
and
incidentally,
what
we're
confronted
with
now,
we
say
that
schneiderman,
the
time
may
have
changed,
it
may
have
changed
back
and
forth
and
they
have
changed
for
perhaps
quite
violently
in
the
communist
party
itself.
the
time
may
changed,
have
changed
but
there's
never
shown
the
government
has
never
shown
anything
that
schneiderman
changed.
and
we
say
that
schneiderman
is
entitled
to
that
repost,
that
the
adjudication
gave
him
once,
until
such
time,
and
there's
evidence
showing
new
condition
or
so
on,
he
has
got
his
certificate
that
as
long
as
he
conducted
himself
in
the
way
he
had
conducted
himself
when
the
court
approved
of
his
conduct,
that
until
the
government
shows
a
change
in
condition,
that
is
what
we
say
is
the
collateral
estoppel.
mr.
robert
w.
kenny
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
kenny
well
my
point
was
that
he
had
a
certificate
and
the
rest
of
us
don't.
that
schneiderman
had
--
did
litigate
his
question
of
his
advocacy
of
force
and
violence.
that
is
--
mr.
robert
w.
kenny
well,
that
might
be
a
little
--
mr.
robert
w.
kenny
no.
well,
in
the
absence
of
change
--
mr.
robert
w.
kenny
--
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
kenny
well,
we
agree
that
the
opportunity,
it
was
open
in
the
government
to
make
that
new
showing,
and
the
government
did
not
take
that
opportunity
because
it
failed
to
make
that
kind
of
a
showing.
mr.
robert
w.
kenny
that
is
correct.
there
is
--
mr.
robert
w.
kenny
mere
membership
clause
advocacy
of
marxist-leninist
doctrine
to
lines
that
is
the
old
advocacy
in
circulation
of
the
old
classics,
plus
membership
and
officership
over
a
long
period
of
time.
these
are
the
inferences
which
we
say
the
government
appeared
on
this
to
reach
the
conclusion
of
guilt.
and
we
say
that
in
the
first
amendment
case,
i
can
present
them.
mr.
robert
w.
kenny
i
didn't
get
the
correct
--
mr.
robert
w.
kenny
oh,
i
think
they
are
--
they
could
be
different.
that
is
you
could
have
membership
and
still
not
read
their
advocate
or
read
the
books.
so,
i
think
it
--
mr.
robert
w.
kenny
i
think
that
is
right.
i
think
that
the
government,
and
that's
why
the
government,
i
think
makes
that
as
a
second
half
of
its
proposition.
that
is
a,
membership
and
officership,
and
then
b,
the
reading
of
the
books
and
advocacy
of
them.
mr.
robert
w.
kenny
the
last
collateral
estoppel
case.
i
remember
was
paramount
pictures.
mr.
robert
w.
kenny
well
that
--
that
one
i
--
mr.
robert
w.
kenny
this
--
this
i
couldn't
help
the
court
on.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
w.
kenny
yes,
sir.
