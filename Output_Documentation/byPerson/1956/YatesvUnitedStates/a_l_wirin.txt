mr.
a.
l.
wirin
may
it
please
the
court.
the
thrust
of
my
argument
will
be
with
respect
to
judicial
policy
or
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
judicial
iniquity,
namely
that
the
sentence
in
this
case
was
in
the
federal
statute
of
this
case
so
unduly
harsh
and
severe
as
to
make
it
appropriate
for
this
court
to
invoke
a
general
supervisory
power
or
to
the
administration
of
justice
generally
in
the
district
court
and
in
connection
which
contempt
subject
to
that.
and
therefore,
i
want
to
call
your
honors
attention
on
a
number
of
facts
that
i
hope
you
will
find.
in
the
numerous
prosecutions
under
the
smith
act
throughout
the
country,
mrs.
yates
is
not
the
first
defendant
to
refuse
to
give
names.
the
first
defendant
was
in
the
famous,
the
famous
kennedy
case.
mr.
gates
was
a
witness.
the
trial
judge,
judge
medina
is
not
known
as
the
stock
dealer
on
communist
or
communism.
we
know
what
the
trial
judge
did
there
as
to
the
defendants
and
even
to
the
lawyer.
but
as
to
the
matter
of
refusal
to
give
names,
judge
medina
considered
it
adequate
to
the
situation
to
impose
a
sentence
of
30
days.
when
the
(inaudible)
case
was
heard
before
judge
chesler,
judge
chesler
considered
30
days
adequate
to
the
situation
then.
when
does
a
similar
matter
arose
before
judge
medina
in
the
case
of
(inaudible)
enforcement
in
effort
upon
it,
particularly
familiar,
there
again
judge
medina
thought
that
the
authority
of
the
court
on
the
one
hand
could
square
with
the
rights
of
the
individual
on
the
other
by
a
sentence
of
30
days.
indeed,
your
honors
will
be
interested
to
know
the
defendants
were
proud
to
learn
there
that
in
the
smith
act
case
in
st.louis,
judge
parker,
when
the
prosecutor
asked
the
defendant's
name,
refused
to
judge
that
defendant
in
contempt.
now,
the
imposing
of
severe
sentencing
upon
defendant
in
the
smith
act
case
who
takes
the
stand
to
his
defense
and
presumably
in
defense
of
the
remaining
colleagues
who
have
not
rested,
the
taking
of
the
stand
by
a
defendant
in
the
smith
act
case
is
an
important
aspect
of
the
right
of
defendant
regarding
essential
charge
involving
him
and
who
ordinarily
better
than
the
defendant
can
testify
to
their
intent.
but
if
--
when
a
defendant
who
under
our
administration
of
justice
has
the
right
to
assert
a
defense
attempts
to
do
so
and
then
find
himself
confronted
with
severe,
serious,
harsh
penalties
because
a
refusal
it
had
made.
it
may
not
very
well
mean
anything,
the
deprivation
of
the
right
to
defend.
you
got
it
from
mr.
branton,
that
once
mrs.
yates
was
given
this
sentence,
it
became
obvious
to
the
defendants
that
they
were
in
a
very
serious
situation,
they
had
already
set
four
and
a
half
months
in
jail
because
this
judge
wouldn't
grant
bail
and
no
matter
how
they
come
to
this
court
and
again
back
to
the
trial
court.
they
anticipated
this
judge
would
be
harsh
to
them
as
the
sentence
he
imposed
the
maximum
submitted
by
law,
five
years
and
$10,000
on
each
defendant.
and
so,
no
other
defendant
took
the
stand
when
they
saw
what
was
happening
to
their
colleagues,
mrs.
yates.
and
therefore,
it
is
a
serious
matter
in
the
administration
of
justice
and
for
difficult
cases
where
persons
are
charged
with
advocacy
of
certain
kind
of
opinions
for
anyone
of
the
defendants
to
find
himself
not
only
facing
the
maximum
sentence
permitted
by
the
smith
act
but
also
facing
severe
additional
sentences
keep
on
to
him
to
serve
at
the
end
of
the
time
that
he
serves
his
full
five-year
sentence
as
a
price
for
asserting
the
right
of
putting
on
a
defense.
now,
there
are
other
considerations
of
judicial
policy
that
i
call
to
your
attention.
mrs.
yates
said,
she
would
not
make
names
and
identify
communists
because
of
the
harm
that
will
come
to
them.
the
time
in
the
history
of
america
was
1952,
the
place
was
california,
for
her
to
identify
communists
at
that
time
and
that
place
and
possible
indictment
by
the
department
of
justice
under
the
smith
act
meant
probable
harassment
by
the
federal
and
state
investigating
committees,
meant
certain
loss
of
public
and
private
employment
in
california.
she's
on
the
court
and
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
give
names
and
identify
persons
and
hurt
them
because
she
said
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
become
a
government
informer
and
the
judge
so
understood.
he
said,
"mrs.
yates
does
not
want
to
be
an
informer."
what
is
the
significance
of
her
refusal
to
answer
questions
on
the
grounds
that
you'd
become
an
informer
again
in
1952
and
in
the
smith
act
case?
she
had
suffered
a
number
of
months
as
a
defendant
in
this
case
and
have
--
had
observed
the
governments
witnesses.
every
single
witness
called
by
the
government
was
a
paid
informer.
what
is
--
what
was
a
paid
informer?
they
are
in
two
categories,
they
are
those
who
are
full-time,
in
the
full-time
employ
of
the
government
and
received
compensation,
so
far
professional
witnesses
like
john
lautner.
there
are
others
who
work
as
it
were
by
the
peace.
they
are
called
to
testify
in
particular
cases
and
they
give
their
testimony
in
such
cases.
i
suppose
it's
the
reasonable
inference
that
if
the
testimonies
they
did
in
one
case
is
helpful
to
the
government
in
that
case,
the
likelihood
of
further
peace
work
of
their
being
called
for
further
testimony
is
the
greater.
the
informants
are
also
in
this
case,
perhaps
divisible
into
other
categories.
there
are
those
who
went
into
the
communist
party
at
the
pay
of
the
government
and
there
are
those
who
became
terminals
and
who
in
the
pay
of
the
government
turned
out
more
paid
to
the
informers
against
their
former
colleagues.
the
evidence
in
this
case
discloses
that
the
witnesses
of
the
government
received
the
sum
of
$48,303.02
prior
to
their
testimony
in
this
case.
she
had
seen
and
heard
these
government
witnesses,
these
informers,
the
like
of
which
she
rebelled
against
being
on
the
witness
stand.
she
had
heard
john
lautner
to
help
the
government
state
that
the
defendant
richmond,
was
seen
by
him
at
a
convention
of
the
communist
party
in
1945,
when
the
fact
was
that
richmond
was
serving
his
country
--
our
country
to
the
armed
forces
overseas
during
that
period.
she
had
heard
an
informer
(inaudible),
identified
the
client
whom
i
represent
in
that
case
(inaudible)
as
having
been
seen
by
him
at
a
meeting
of
a
communist
party
in
los
angeles
in
january
1951,
when
the
fact
of
the
matter
was
she
was
in
jail,
in
custody
because
she
couldn't
furnish
the
bail
which
the
trial
judge
was
demanding
at
that
time.
she
had
heard
an
informant
who's
tried
to
testified
that
the
communist
would
start
revolution
and
would
use
guns
and
discover
that
at
the
same
time
contemporaneously
when
(inaudible)
testified
he
had
heard
a
defendant
make
that
statement,
it
turned
out
within
the
report
of
the
f.b.i.
the
statement
which
the
defendant
was
suppose
to
have
made
was
that
there
would
be
a
revolution
by
the
fascists
not
the
communists.
and
she
had
heard
and
informed
the
rest
will
testify
that
he
was
in
the
employ
of
the
f.b.i.
that
he
made
friends,
that
he
induced
his
friends
to
join
the
communist
party
and
then
he
turned
those
days
over
in
pursuant
of
his
employment
to
the
government.
now,
it
is
true,
your
honors,
that
1952,
mrs.
yates
did
not
have
the
patience
to
anticipate
that
this
very
court,
this
very
last
term
would
look
upon
a
record
in
which
there
was
testimony
from
informers
and
consider
it
so
endangered
as
to
require
remand.
and
certainly,
she
did
not
have
the
patience
then
to
know
that
in
this
very
court,
this
very
term,
in
the
very
next
case
which
is
to
be
argued,
the
solicitor
general
of
united
states
is
suggesting
to
this
court
a
tainting
of
a
record
by
virtue
of
the
irresponsible
if
not
but
the
jury's
testimony
of
a
paid
informer.
but
if
she
didn't
have
the
questions,
she
did
have
some
history
in
which
her
resistance
to
giving
names
was
mooted,
and
let
me
faithfully
advert
to
a
page
or
to
up
history.
it
is
generally
known
that
in
the
1920's,
when
mr.
mitchell
palmer,
was
attorney
general,
the
number
of
outstanding
americans
objected
to
the
then
raid
against
communist
because
of
the
use
of
informers
by
the
then
department
of
justice.
the
gentlemen
included
professor
chafee
of
the
harvard
law
school,
be
impound
of
that
school
and
others.
and
there
is
the
historic
decision
by
judge
anderson
in
(inaudible)
to
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
had
referred
in
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
the
galvan
case.
a
case
in
which
mr.
chafee
and
others
appeared
amici
before
judge
anderson.
it
was
judge
anderson
in
the
1920's
said,
"that
no
honest
man
would
be
a
government
informer,"
referring
to
the
informers,
in
the
employ
of
the
department
of
justice,
and
the
irresponsibility
of
their
testimony
during
the
1920's.
and
since
i
am
turning
to
history
and
have
given
your
honors
a
page
with
respect
to
matters
in
1920,
permit
me
to
turn
to
page
back
even
further
to
1798
into
the
alien
and
sedition
laws
to
which
the
chief
justice
had
occasioned
to
refer
in
a
footnote
in
pennsylvania
against
nelson,
to
which
mr.
justice
holmes
had
occasioned
to
refer
in
the
dissent
of
(inaudible)
when
the
alien
and
seditions
laws
were
proposed
in
this
country,
happily
they
were
at
existence
only
two
years,
this
statute
has
been
upon
the
statute
books
since
1940
and
it's
being
widely
enforced
currently
as
your
honors
know.
but
on
the
alien
and
sedition
laws
were
for
adoption
before
congress,
mr.
edward
livingston
arose
in
the
hall
of
the
congress
and
he
made
this
statement
about
informers
to
which
i
call
your
attention.
he
said,
"the
country
was
swarmed
with
five
informant,
delators
and
all
the
odious
reptile
tribe
that
breed
in
the
sunshine
of
despotic
power."
now,
i
hope
your
honors
do
not
consider
that
i
am
overstating
the
situation.
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
what
mrs.
yates
was
saying
here
she
could
not
stoop
to
join
the
class
of
this
reptile
breed
which
a
class
which
has
been
held
in
odium
throughout
the
ages
in
every
land.
for
she
said,
"i
cannot
bring
myself
to
do
that,"
meaning
i
cannot
bring
myself
to
become
a
paid
informer.
for
she
said
if
she
did,
"i
would
be
going
around
hanging
my
head
in
shame
the
rest
of
my
life,"
and
she
felt
she
couldn't
do
that.
of
course
in
current
history,
we
have
other
examples.
your
honors
will
recall
that
(inaudible)
on
part
or
before
a
committee
said,
"i
will
tell
about
myself
but
i
will
know
no
names
of
my
--
of
any
colleague."
and
mr.
(inaudible)
has
just
currently
taking
--
taken
the
same
position.
in
short,
there
are
many
americans
of
high
courage
and
self-conscience
who
are
unwilling
to
becoming
informers
and
to
name
colleagues
as
communist
when
there
maybe
reprisal
upon
them
no
matter
the
price
they
pay.
now,
i
have
said
and
i
offer
no
(inaudible)
that
her
position
was
as
we
see
her
position
rooted
in
history.
and
now,
i
want
to
suggest
that
her
position
was
rooted
even
deeper
to
that
in
history
and
was
rooted
and
bottomed
in
conscience.
she
said
and
the
record
showed,
page
29
that
when
she
explained
her
inability
to
testify,
it
was
because
of
conscience.
judge
mathis
so
understood
it.
he
said
her
situation
was
analogous
to
that
as
the
jehovah's
witnesses
who
take
the
position
because
they
believe
the
word
of
god
requires
them.
so,
he
recognized
that
her
position
was
on
--
based
on
conscience.
indeed,
let
me
call
your
honors
attention
to
what
she
said
and
then
to
another
historic
example
and
i
shall
be
done.
she
said
in
all
conscience,
i
cannot
do
otherwise
than
adhere
to
this
clear
determination
of
hers
not
to
name
names
which
will
result
her
in
harm
to
those
who
she
named.
the
other
historical
example
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
the
crux
of
my
argument
is
solely
that
the
punishment
was
excessive
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
and
the
input
of
my
argument
is
that
she
had
--
since
she
already
has
served
70
days
by
virtue
of
--
of
what
--
what
took
place
that
that
--
that
the
service
at
that
time
meets
the
--
meets
the
demands
of
the
authority
of
the
state
or
of
the
judiciary
under
one
hand
and
omits
a
reconciliation
with
the
exercise
of
conscience
on
the
other.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
and
that
--
and
that
this
court
has
--
has
the
authority
to
do
it.
therefore,
i
want
to
give
your
honors
this
--
this
final
example.
perhaps
your
honors
will
recall
what
it
was
that
martin
luther
said
or
did
when
he
arrived
at
his
views
and
he
was
--
when
he
was
called
for
trial,
the
diet
of
worms,
the
diet
of
worms.
he
had
arrived
at
his
(inaudible)
and
he
took
a
nail
and
he
pounded
the
nail
and
the
document
upon
which
his
views
were
expressed
on
the
church
door
at
once.
and
he
said
--
and
i
--
i
credit
this
to
mr.
--
to
judge
hand
in
united
states
against
helen.
he
said
i
neither
can
nor
will
recant
anything,
since
it
is
neither
right
nor
safe
to
act
against
conscience.
here,
i
stand,
i
can
do
no
other.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
mrs.
yates
completely
without
her
realizing
what
she
was
saying
and
whose
great
words
she
was
in
effect,
"that
she
was
taking
essentially
the
same
position,"
for
as
caution
is
the
central
pieces
of
my
position
that
the
struggle
for
freedom
of
conscience
is
the
same
everywhere
and
at
all
times
and
often
finds
its
expression
even
in
the
same
words.
now,
this
court
has
on
numerous
occasions
beginning
with
the
chief
justice
hughes
in
his
dissent
in
the
mcintosh
case
which
finds
acceptance
in
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
douglas
for
this
court
in
the
(inaudible)
case.
that
it
will
seek
to
accommodate
the
authority
of
the
state
with
the
demands
of
conscience.
and
my
argument
is
that
that
accommodation
maybe
arrived
at
by
this
court
by
reversing
the
present
judgment
which
will
mean
that
the
--
that
mrs.
yates
had
served
seven
days
in
jail
for
her
refusal
to
have
--
70
days
in
jail
for
her
refusal
to
have
given
names
of
colleagues
of
hers
who
might
be
penalized
or
otherwise
suffer
if
their
names
were
given.
