mr.

margolis
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
ben
margolis
no,
each
of
the
cases
will
be
argued
separately
but
they
are
consolidated.
they
have
been
consolidated
by
the
court
for
a
single
--
appearing
a
single
argument,
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
ben
margolis
we
will
have
myself,
mr.
kenny,
and
mr.
donovan.
i
am
arguing
case
number
6,
which
involved
11
of
the
petitioners
in
the
case.
if
the
court
please,
this
--
mr.
ben
margolis
there
are
no
--
i
will
state
right
at
the
outset,
your
honor
that
aside
from
some
evidence
with
respect
to
individual
acts
or
statements
of
individual
petitioners
and
aside
from
differences
with
respect
to
their
position
in
the
communist
party,
there
are
no
substantial
differences
among
these
petitioners.
mr.
ben
margolis
aside
from
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ben
margolis
--
aside
--
aside
from
the
fact
that
there
are
differences
as
to
individual
statements
attributed
to
the
petitioners,
differences
as
to
their
positions
held
within
the
communist
party.
mr.
ben
margolis
i
believe
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
however,
counsel
may
disagree.
this
is
the
first
smith
act
case
of
course
since
dennis
that
this
court
has
agreed
to
hear.
i
think
that
the
court
should
know
at
the
outset
that
the
indictment
in
this
case,
names
all
of
the
defendants
in
the
dennis
case
as
co-conspirators
with
the
defendants
in
this
case.
the
theory
of
the
respondent
has
been
at
all
stages
of
this
case
that
the
conspiracy
charged
in
this
case
is
identical
with
the
one
in
dennis
sustained
by
the
decision
of
this
court.
it
might
be
wrong
then
at
the
outset
to
consider
to
what
extent
the
facts
in
this
case
and
those
in
the
dennis
case
are
similar
than
to
what
extent
they're
differ.
there
are,
in
my
opinion,
only
two
facts
common
to
both
cases,
two
general
facts.one
is
that
in
both
cases
all
of
the
defendants
were
admittedly
members
of
the
communist
party.
no
issue
in
dennis
about
that
and
no
issue
here.
the
second
is,
that
in
both
cases
essentially
the
same
books,
the
so-called
“marxist-leninist”
books
were
introduced
into
evidence
and
essentially
the
same
passages
from
those
books
are
relied
upon
by
the
respondent.
i
believe
that
there
is
no
other
fact
of
consequence
that
is
the
same
in
the
two
cases.
the
differences
are
numerous
as
a
comparison
of
the
findings
in
dennis
remembering
that
the
court
did
not
pass
upon
the
sufficiency
of
the
events
on
that
case,
but
accepted
the
findings
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
acted
upon
them.
so
we
take
a
comparison
of
the
findings
in
dennis
with
the
record
in
this
case
where
the
court
has
agreed
to
review
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
in
dennis,
it
was
found,
and
may
i
say
at
the
outset
that
the
court
said
in
dennis
that
these
findings
were
essential
to
its
decision
to
the
finding
that
the
statute
as
applied
was
constitutional.
the
first
finding
is
that
the
petitioners
were
the
leaders
of
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states.
that
they
were
all
members
of
a
small,
compact,
top
governing
body.
this
was
charged
in
the
indictment.
this
was
the
undisputed
evidence.
this
--
they
were
all
members
of
the
group
known
as
the
national
board
of
the
party.
none
of
the
defendants,
none
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case
are
or
ever
were
members
of
that
body.
during
the
period
within
the
statute
of
limitations
of
the
11
petitioners
who
i
represent,
only
four
--
first
of
all
not
a
single
one
of
them
held
any
national
position,
not
one.
only
four
held
positions
as
officials
of
the
state
organization,
the
california
state
organization
of
the
communist
party
and
they
were
members
of
the
state
committee
of
that
party.
of
the
remaining
six,
there
is
evidence
that
two
others,
on
some
occasions,
attended
meetings
of
that
state
committee.
of
the
remaining
petitioners,
five
held
offices
and
the
highest
level
of
which
was
the
county.
they
were
county
officials
in
the
county
of
los
angeles
or
county
of
san
franscisco.
two
never
held
any
officers
above
a
city
level.
and
whereas
in
dennis,
there
was
the
common
relationship
between
all
of
the
defendants
in
that
case
by
reason
not
only
of
their
common
membership
on
the
national
board
but
by
reason
of
their
acts
as
found,
as
members
of
the
national
board.
in
this
record,
there
is
nothing
showing
common
activity
on
the
part
of
these
petitioners
at
least
in
the
same
sense,
unless
that
common
activity
be
that
they
were
all
members
of
the
communist
party
and
as
members
of
the
communist
party
independently
within
the
communist
party
carried
on
certain
activities.
the
dennis
case
proceeds
also
upon
the
finding
that
the
petitioners
on
that
case,
and
i
believe
these
are
the
words
used
by
the
court,
were
unwilling
to
work
within
the
framework
of
democracy.
i
am
not
here
discussing
the
sufficiency
of
the
findings
in
dennis,
this
court
didn't.
we
must
assume
for
the
purpose
of
the
argument
that
they
were
supported
by
the
record
and
this
court
did.
here,
the
record
is
replete
with
statements
of
support
for,
and
work,
and
plans
all
within
the
framework
about
democratic
process
relating
to
legislation,
relating
to
running
for
office,
relating
to
discussion
of
various
issues
which
were
current
controversial
issues
being
decided
within
the
framework
of
our
democratic
process
with
these
petitioners
taking
their
part
in
making
that
decision,
small,
minority,
and
popularism
might
be.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
a
great
deal
of
this
evidence.
in
fact
perhaps
a
major
portion
of
this
evidence
with
respect
to
the
almost
total
preoccupation
of
these
defendants
with
their
activities
within
the
framework
of
our
democratic
process,
came
from
respondent's
witnesses
and
as
a
result
of
their
direct
examination,
because
of
the
theory
which
respondent
proceeds
on
in
this
case,
and
that
is,
that
any
activity
within
the
communist
party,
according
to
the
respondent,
is
evidence
of
participation
in
the
conspiracy.
this
is
a
subject
that
i'll
come
back
to
a
number
of
times
during
the
course
of
my
argument.
next,
there
was
a
finding
in
the
dennis
case
that
the
defendants
there
intended
to
initiate
a
violent
revolution
whenever
the
propitious
occasion
occurred.
now
that
finding
did
not
result
from
independent
evidence
of
intent,
but
as
the
decision
indicates
was
a
finding
which
arose
out
of
the
other
findings
of
the
activities
of
the
petitioners
in
that
case
of
the
dennis
defendants,
that
is
their
activities
as
members
of
the
national
board,
their
advocacy
and
the
other
findings
that
i
referred
to
here.
in
other
words,
intent
came
as
a
direct
result
there
of
findings
of
fact,
none
of
which
are
present
in
this
case,
none
of
which
can
be
supported
by
the
record
in
this
case.
moreover,
concededly
that
intent
could
be
deduced
from
findings
of
activities
other
than
those
which
it
was
found
the
dennis
defendants'
engagement.
but
i
believe
we
will
demonstrate,
i
believe
--
i
believe
our
brief
demonstrates
that
there
is
no
basis
for
any
finding
with
respect
to
anyone
of
these
petitioners
resulting
from
their
activities,
resulting
from
their
knowledge
as
shown
by
the
evidence
to
support
a
finding
of
this
kind
of
intent.
next
was
probably
the
most
important
single
finding
made
in
dennis.
in
dennis,
this
court
may
remember,
the
indictment
was
returned,
i
believe,
some
three
days
short
or
three
years
after
the
reconstitution
of
the
communist
party
just
barely
in
time
to
bring
that
reconstitution
within
the
limits
of
the
statute
of
limitations
if
in
fact
the
government
intended
to
rely
probably
on
that.
and
the
finding
that
was
made
with
respect
to
these
laws,
that
these
defendants,
these
members
of
the
top
governing
board,
use
their
control
of
the
communist
political
association,
which
has
been
organized
in
1944
some
13
or
14
months
earlier
as
a
result
of
the
dissolution
of
the
communist
party.
that
they
had
used
their
control
of
the
communist
political
association
to
change
it
from
an
organization
which
had
a
policy
of
peaceful
cooperation
with
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
a
peaceful
change
within
the
democratic
framework
of
the
united
states
to
one
which
worked
for
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
force
and
violence.
in
other
words
what
they
said,
this
court
said
here,
here
are
the
small
group
of
men
who
set
down,
they
control
the
communist
political
association,
this
was
a
lawful
organization
engaging
in
rights,
in
activities
protected
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
by
their
control,
they
changed
it
to
an
organization
the
object
of
which
was
to
accomplish
the
forceful
overthrow
of
our
government.
how
about
the
record
here?
first
of
all,
there
is
not
one
word
of
evidence
to
indicate
that
anyone
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case
exercised
to
any
extent
the
kind
of
control
that
the
petitioners
in
dennis
were
found
to
have
exercised.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
anyone
of
them
had
anything
to
do
with
bringing
about
such
a
change.
there
is
no
evidence
that
they
denied
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
i
have
pointed
out,
only
four
of
the
individuals
were
even
members
of
the
state
committee,
of
the
11
i
represent.
and
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
state
committee
of
the
communist
party
did
anything
to
change
the
communist
political
association
from
an
organization
which
believe
in
peaceful
advocacy,
of
peaceful
change
to
one
which
worked
for
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
next
and
this
is
rather
interesting
point
although
i
have
sometimes
been
in
doubt
about
its
full
significance.
the
dennis
indictment,
the
dennis
findings
were,
that
the
conspiracy
was
initiated
in
1945
with
the
reconstitution
of
the
communist
party.
i
want
the
finding
that
the
communist
political
association
that
fourteenth-month
period
was
not
a
period
when
any
conspiracy
as
far
as
that
organization
was
concerned
or
anything
in
relation
to
it
was
in
action.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
i
pointed
out,
that
reconstitution
of
the
communist
party
was
the
key
evidence
in
dennis.
here,
when
the
original
indictment
was
returned,
it
was
alleged
that
the
conspiracy
began
in
1945
on
the
same
date
that
was
alleged
in
the
dennis
case.
that
indictment
was
dismissed
because
of
the
failure
to
allege
intent,
and
a
new
indictment
was
returned
some
months
later.
and
in
that
indictment,
it
was
alleged
that
the
conspiracy
began
in
1940,
i
don't
recall
the
exact
date
but
it
was
the
date
when
the
smith
act
became
effective.
the
theory
of
the
respondent
apparently
be,
that
the
conspiracy
was
in
existence
for
sometime
prior
to
that
date
but
that
it
became
unlawful
upon
the
smith
act
becoming
effective.
in
the
dennis
case,
it
was
found
that
communist
party
was
a
highly
disciplined
organization.
that
the
dennis
defendants
controlled
it
and
that
they
would
tolerate
no
dissension
from
the
policies
laid
down
by
them,
but
instead
that
they
insisted
that
the
program
be
slavishly
followed.
i
say
that
there
is
just
no
proof
of
that
in
this
record,
just
no
evidence
of
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
from
respondent's
own
witnesses,
there
appears
a
tremendous
amount
of
evidence
concerning
many
differences
of
opinion
among
members
of
the
communist
parties,
considerable
dissension
on
various
issues.
it
is
true
that
there
is
evidence
showing
that
the
communist
party
exercised
this
right
to
expel
certain
persons
from
its
organization
just
trade
unions
and
other
organizations
from
time
to
time
exercise
the
right
to
expel
some
of
their
members.
but
the
significant
thing
is
the
basis
for
the
expulsion.
they
were
of
three
kinds.
they
were
those
who
wanted
to
advocate
socialism
that
socialism
be
established
now
when
a
majority
of
the
people
was
opposed
to
it,
instead
of
indicating
a
willingness
to
wait
for
advocating
the
establishment
of
socialism
until
such
time
as
it
was
believed
that
the
american
people
would
want
by
a
majority,
by
an
overwhelming
majority
to
have
socialism
established.
these
people
who
didn't
want
to
wait
were
the
ones
who
were
expelled.
then
there
were
certain
informers
and
spies
and
their
character,
i
think,
has
been
evidenced
by
some
recent
developments
before
this
court.
there
were
certain
informers
and
spies.
they
were
expelled
from
this
organization
as
i
think
they
would
be
expelled
from
any
organization.
and
finally,
there
was
the
expulsion
of
a
person
who
carried
a
gun,
and
who
discriminated
against
negroes
and
those
were
the
charges
they
give.
now
if
that
indicates
iron
control,
then
it
also
indicates
the
character
of
the
iron
control
exercise
within
the
communist
party
in
california.
it
was
found
in
dennis
that
the
petitioners
in
that
case
were
adept
at
infiltration
into
strategic
positions.
there
just
no
evidence
of
that
here,
just
none
of
any
adeptness,
of
any
willful
infiltration
into
strategic
positions.
it
was
found
in
dennis
that
the
petitioners
there
used
aliases
in
order
to
cover
up
their
work.
there
is
no
such
evidence
here.
it
was
found
in
dennis
and
this
i
think
is
a
matter
of
very
great
importance.
that
the
petitioners
in
that
case
used
double
meaning
language.
now
that
was
predicated
upon
the
testimony
of
one
(inaudible),
who
testified
that
on
the
basis
of
his
association
with
the
petitioners
in
that
case,
he
knew
that
when
they
talk
in
favor
of
peaceful
change,
they
didn't
mean
it.
they
meant
violence
instead.
he
said
he
knew
them.
this
was
a
very
important
bit
of
testimony
in
the
reason
that
it
was
so
important
in
that
case,
is
that
in
1945
when
the
communist
party
was
reconstituted,
in
1945
when
the
communist
party
was
reconstituted,
it
adopted
a
constitution
and
that
constitution
stated
that
the
party
predicated
itself
upon
marxism-leninism.
and
it
also
stated
that
it
favored
the
achievement
of
socialism
in
the
united
states
through
winning
a
majority
of
the
people
to
that
end.
it
also
adopted
provisions
for
the
expulsion
from
the
organization
of
advocates
of
force
and
violence.
now
(inaudible)
explained
all
of
these
away.
he
said
that
was
protective
coverage.
whether
his
testimony
was
truthful
or
not,
it's
not
before
us,
but
he
said
this
is
protective
coverage.
this
people
who
whined
didn't
mean
this.
marxism-leninism
is
the
key
there.
he
says,
“i
know
when
they
used
the
word
marxism-leninism,
they
meant
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence.”
and
this
other
language
was
just
been
put
in
there
to
fool
people.
there
is
no
such
evidence
in
this
case,
none
whatsoever.
there
is
no
evidence
insofar
as
this
case
is
concerned
that
the
constitution
of
the
communist
party,
when
it
said
that
it
favored
the
achievement
of
socialism
by
winning
the
majority
to
that
end,
when
it
indicated,
it's
our
position
to
advocate
force
and
violence
meant
anything
else
to
the
petitioners
than
what
it
said,
not
one
word
of
evidence.
finally,
there
was
a
finding
in
dennis
that
the
defendants
in
that
case
advocated
force
and
violence
by
statements
and
activities
of
the
leaders
and
by
literature.
now,
as
i
will
show
a
little
more
detail
here
as
much
detailed
if
time
will
allow,
there
were
no
such
statements
here
by
any
of
the
petitioners.
it
is
true
that
the
essentially
the
same
marxist-leninist
books
and
passages
are
relied
upon
in
the
two
cases
and
to
that
extent,
the
two
cases
are
similar.
but
it
is
also
true
that
in
this
case,
there
is
literature
of
the
communist
party
introduced
both
by
the
respondent
itself
and
by
the
defendants
in
the
case
indicating
that
the
american
communist
party
or
at
least
indicating
a
position
from
which
it
would
be
possible
to
conclude
very
reasonably
that
the
american
communist
party
does
not
favor
in
fact
disposed
to
the
use
of
force
and
violence
as
long
as
democratic
processes
are
open
and
as
long
as
our
present
form
of
government
exists.
and
there
was
an
article
by
mrs.yates,
the
defendant
whose
name
leads
all
the
rest
in
this
case.
in
which
she
took
issue
with
a
group
who
recalled
the
(inaudible)
who
were
expelled
who
said,
“we
want
to
fight
for
socialism
now”,
and
in
which
he
said,
“no,
you
can't
educate
the
majority
of
the
american
people
for
socialism.
you've
got
to
win
them
to
that.”
there
was
--
excuse
me.
mr.
ben
margolis
strongly
as
i
possibly
--
mr.
ben
margolis
--
can,
your
honor.
but
just
was
no
evidence
and
i
intend
to
discuss
the
respondent's
theory
in
connection
with
that
we
do
dispute.
there
was
much
other
material
of
the
party
there
which
indicated
men
of
these
petitioners,
which
indicated
their
view
that
they
favored
peaceful
change,
that
they
favored
socialism,
is
--
is
on
question.
but
that
they
favored
peaceful
changes
a
method
of
achieving
it
is
what
we
contend
the
record
shows
and
what
the
respondent
disputes.for
example,
there
is
evidence
that
when
the
schneiderman
decision
came
down,
one
of
the
defendants
here
being
the
schneiderman,
being
mr.
schneiderman,
this
was
welcomed.
and
what
was
stated
as
a
tenable
conclusion
there
was
stated
by
petitioners
here
to
be
their
own
view
of
what
marxism-leninism
meant.
there
are
many
other
instances
of
this
kind
which
time
does
not
permit
me
to
go
into.
it
is
my
position
in
short
that
not
a
single
one
of
the
basic
facts
which
this
court
found
were
essential
to
the
sustaining
of
the
convictions
in
the
dennis
case
in
holding
the
statute
constitutional
as
applied,
not
one
of
those
facts
has
been
proved
here.
but
there
are
also
additional
factors
that
were
not
present
in
dennis.
for
example,
at
the
time
that
the
dennis
case
was
tried,
the
conspiracy
section
was
a
part
of
the
smith
act
itself.
subsequently,
prior
to
the
time
of
the
trial
in
this
case,
that
was
amended
out
of
the
smith
act
and
the
general
conspiracy
section
was
applied
in
this
case.
the
smith
act
conspiracy
section
required
no
proof
of
an
overt
act
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
the
general
conspiracy
section
which
is
applicable
here,
as
the
court
i'm
sure
know,
does
require
a
proof
of
an
overt
act
and
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
there
was
no
issue
in
dennis
as
to
whether
such
an
overt
act
had
been
committed.
here,
there
is
such
an
issue.
and
here
the
issue
is
this,
i
believe.
i
think
that
respondent
takes
the
position
that
any
act
committed
by
any
petitioner
which
in
any
way
helps
the
communist
party,
not
helps
it
towards
its
illegal
objective,
but
helps
it
in
any
way,
is
an
overt
act
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
and
i
believe
that
this
presents
a
new
and
an
important
constitutional
question
of
construction
and
application
of
this
statute
both
under
the
first
amendment
under
due
process
and
simply
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction.
mr.
ben
margolis
no
sir.
my
recollection
is
that
there
were
not.
mr.
ben
margolis
my
recollection
is
that
--
mr.
ben
margolis
my
--
i
understand
your
question,
i
maybe
wrong,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
but
my
recollection
is
that
no
overt
acts
as
such
were
charged.
mr.
ben
margolis
that's
my
recollection.
mr.
ben
margolis
i
say
that
there's
no
evidence
--
evidence
so
far
as
the
teachings
of
the
party
are
concerned,
but
there
just
no
evidence
of
it,
that
is.
mr.
ben
margolis
that
there
is
no
evidence.
let
me
make
my
--
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
ben
margolis
but
let
me
--
let
me
say
this.
what
i
am
--
my
point
is
that
there
is
not
here
clear,
convincing,
and
unequivocal
evidence,
meeting
the
standards
of
the
first
amendment
from
which
it
can
be
found
that
anyone
of
these
petitioners,
either
by
virtue
of
their
membership
in
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states,
the
communist
party
of
california
or
any
other
subdivision
thereof
or
by
virtue
of
any
other
fact
adhered
to
a
conspiracy
as
charged,
just
no
evidence.
that's
our
position.
mr.
ben
margolis
that
is
our
position.
mr.
ben
margolis
it
is
my
position,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
wherever
the
first
amendment
is
involved
it
has
to
be
given
consideration
of
interpreting
the
law.
mr.
ben
margolis
well,
i
would
say
first
of
all,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
the
overt
act
in
accordance
with
the
ordinary
requirements
would
be
--
have
to
be
a
step
toward
the
completion,
a
step
moving
toward
the
consummation
of
the
conspiracy.
mr.
ben
margolis
yes,
yes.
but
that
--
that
--
but
in
addition
it
is
my
position
that
advocacy
protected
under
the
first
amendment
that
is
speech
which
is
not
lawful
but
which
were
false
completely
100%
within
the
framework
of
our
democratic
processes
cannot
consistently
with
the
first
amendment
be
an
overt
act
and
a
conspiracy
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence
without
returning
the
doctrine
of
seditious
conspiracy
which
i
think
the
first
amendment
was
intended
to
terminate
in
this
country
forever.
mr.
ben
margolis
i
said
lawful
speech,
which
speech
expressing
ideas
which
are
fully
protected
by
the
constitution
cannot
be.
i
am
not
talking
now
about
advocacy
of
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence
under
certain
circumstances.
i'm
talking
about
lawful
speech.
i'm
talking
about
speaking
for
fppc.
i'm
talking
even
about
opposing
this
court's
decision
in
dennis
which
i
think
there
is
a
right
to
do.
mr.
ben
margolis
the
difference
is
this.
if
i
do
not
believe
--
mr.
ben
margolis
i
believe,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
where
the
lawful,
where
the
speech
is
merely
the
conveyance
of
an
idea
rather
than
part
of
a
course
of
conduct
that
it
cannot
be
an
overt
act
in
any
kind
of
conspiracy
case.
mr.
ben
margolis
no,
i'm
not
saying
that,
your
honor.
i'm
not
taking
about
that.
i'm
not
talking
about
incitement.
mr.
ben
margolis
i'm
talking
about
or
advocacy
of
ideas
--
mr.
ben
margolis
supportive
ideas
--
vigorous
supportive
ideas.
mr.
ben
margolis
yes
and
it
isn't
limited
to
just
sort
of
a
yes,
but
discussion,
you
can
be
strong
in
your
discussion
as
you
want
to
be.
and
it's
the
first
amendment
protects,
i
can't
be
an
overt
act
in
any
kind
of
a
crime
as
long
as
the
first
amendment
stands
in
my
opinion.
mr.
ben
margolis
that's
a
different
point.
i
--
i
--
an
incitement
--
mr.
ben
margolis
well,
i
--
i
am
not
--
i
think
the
dennis
case
--
well
i
think
the
dennis
case
was
wrongly
decided
there,
but
i
don't
want
to
argue
that
point
because
it
isn't
necessary,
you
might
have
been
--
mr.
ben
margolis
for
the
purpose
of
this
case,
although,
i
don't
want
to
be
understood
as
agreeing
with
that.
aside
from
the
overt
act
point,
there
are
--
there
are
three
other
or
two
other
respects,
important
respects
in
which
this
case
raises
very
serious
legal
problems,
constitutional
problems
which
are
not
present
in
dennis.
one
is,
that
the
organized
term,
the
organized
section
of
the
conspiracy
the
conspiracy
charges
to
--
charges
an
agreement
to
organize
as
the
communist
party
of
united
states
an
organization
which
advocates
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
that
in
dennis,
there
was
no
problem
about
the
meaning
of
the
term
“organize”.
because
as
used
in
dennis
and
in
accordance
with
the
court's
findings
there,
the
word
“organize”
was
applied
to
the
reconstitution
of
the
communist
party
to
in
effect
the
creation
of
a
new
organization
and
to
giving
it
the
attributes
of
an
organization
which
advocated
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
therefore
there
was
no
question
in
that
case,
about
what
the
word
“organize”
meant
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
or
what
the
word
“organize”
meant
or
could
mean
consistently
with
the
requirements
of
our
constitution.
here
there
is
such
a
question.
because
here
again,
under
the
instructions
of
the
trial
judge,
virtually
any
act
of
a
communist
which
on
the
any
act
which
gave
any
assistance
for
the
communist
party
regardless
of
its
purpose,
regardless
of
its
mode
constituted
organization
of
the
communist
party.
i
think
that
raises
serious
constitutional
statutory
question.
then
of
course
there's
the
question
i
hope
to
discuss
at
some
length
that
the
instruction
which
was
quoted
in
the
dennis
case,
the
one
dealing
with
the
incitement
was
refused
in
this
case
although
it
was
proper
both
by
the
government
and
by
the
defendant
and
no
similar
instruction
was
given.
finally,
the
court
construed
clear
and
present
danger
differently
in
my
opinion
in
this
case
than
it
was
construed
in
dennis.
in
dennis,
as
i
understand
it,
the
court
said
that
in
considering
whether
or
not
there
is
a
clear
and
present
danger
even
as
they're
limited
said,
you
have
to
look
at
the
nature
of
the
activities
of
the
defendants,
their
power
to
bring
about
the
evil,
and
the
objective
conditions
in
the
world
and
the
circumstances
of
the
conspiracy.
all
of
these
things
had
to
be
considered
together
as
i
understand
dennis
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
clear
and
present
danger
existed.
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
ruled
that
a
finding
of
intent
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence,
plus
a
finding
of
an
agreement
to
advocate
such
overthrow
in
and
of
itself
and
then
without
regard
to
anything
else,
any
of
the
factors,
conditions
of
the
world,
nature
of
the
activities,
power
to
bring
about
evil,
created
a
clear
and
present
danger.
i
believed
these
two
raises
most
serious
questions
with
respect
to
the
first
amendment
on
the
construction
of
the
statute.
now
the
respondent
in
this
case
has
two
theories
which
it
urges
support
the
verdicts
of
the
jury
and
the
judgment
of
the
court.
neither
of
these
theories,
i
submit,
find
any
support
in
dennis.
and
in
order
to
sustain
here
these
theories,
it
is
going
to
be
necessary
for
this
court
or
would
be
necessary
for
this
court
to
go
far
beyond
dennis
in
the
limitations
placed
upon
the
right
to
speak
or
in
the
rights
given
to
the
government
to
punish
for
the
exercise
of
free
speech.
now,
here's
the
first
theory.
they
say
the
communist
party
basis
itself
of
marxism-leninism.
and
this
where
it
is
not
in
dispute
because
the
constitution
so
said
the
marxist-leninist
party.
it
circulates
marxist-leninist
literature
because
of
this,
says
the
respondent,
inferences
establishing
every
element
of
the
offense
from
connection
with
the
conspiracy
to
the
proscribe
contempt
can
be
drawn
from
leadership
in
the
communist
party
and
activity
therein
regardless
of
the
character
of
that
activity.
this
was
not
the
dennis
theory,
but
this
is
the
theory
here.
second,
it
is
argued
that
certain
disconnected
oral
declarations
made
by
or
supposedly
made
by
several
of
the
petitioners,
are
also
sufficient
to
establish
every
element
of
the
offense
and
i
want
to
spend
a
few
minutes
--
well,
i'm
not
going
to
spend
a
few
minutes
discussing
those
because
of
the
time
--
well
because
i
want
to
get
on
to
other
things.
let
me
just
simply
say
that
they
are
discussed
in
the
brief
that
there
isn't
one
of
them
that
is
a
clear
statement
as
testified
to
by
an
informer
and
each
of
them
came
from
the
lips
of
an
informer.
there
isn't
anyone
of
them
that
is
an
unequivocal
statement.
there
isn't
any
one
of
them
which
isn't
contradicted
by
other
evidence
in
the
record
and
each
of
them
constitute
and
involved
a
question
of
interpreting
words.
as
for
example,
just
to
take
one
of
them.
well
one
of
the
defendants
is
supposed
to
have
said,
i
want
to
see
the
overthrow
of
this
lousy
system
as
badly
as
anyone
else,
but
the
time
for
militant
action
has
not
yet
arrived.
now,
this
particular
petitioner
to
indicate
the
strength
or
the
weakness
of
the
respondent's
case
was
a
long
time
member
of
the
communist
party.
he
has
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
since
1935.
fifteen
years
during
which
time
the
party
was
riddled
with
informers
and
people
who
later
testified
against
their
former
associates,
who
had
every
opportunity
to
observe
what
this
defendant
and
every
other
defendant
in
this
case
said.
and
during
the
entire
fifteen-year
period
they
come
up
with
this
one
equivocal
sentence
which
says
“the
time
for
militant
action
has
not
yet
arrived”
and
the
use
of
this
word
“militant”
incidentally
by
a
man
whose
main
activity
was
in
the
trade
union
where
the
word
“militant”
as
anyone
who
knows
anything
about
trade
union
activity
is
a
common
word
which
has
no
necessary
association
with
force
and
violence.
if
things
of
this
kind
as
loose,
as
weak,
as
inferior
in
quality
of
evidence
because
they
consist
entirely
of
all
declaration.
and
incidentally,
there
is
not
a
single
one
of
such
declaration
within
the
period
of
the
statute
of
limitations
except
as
to
one
defendant
and
the
evidence
was
limited
as
to
him,
that's
the
defendant
--
the
petitioner
lambert.
so
that
during
the
entire
period
the
statute
of
limitations
among
all
of
these
people,
these
eleven
people
that
i
represent.
there
is
this
one
equivocal
statement.
mr.
ben
margolis
that's
right.
they
don't
and
we
are
not
raising
as
the
respondent
would
have
the
court
believe
simply
questions
of
credibility.
we
say
take
a
look
of
these
things
to
see
what
--
what
stuff
they're
made
off.
they're
the
weakest
kind
of
evidence,
they're
inconsistent
within
themselves,
they're
just
not
solid
convincing
evidence.
that's
what
we
say.
and
it
isn't
believe
or
disbelieve
the
witness.
although
i
don't
believe
that
when
you
get
through
looking
at
the
evidence
of
anyone
of
these
witnesses
that
it
is
possible
to
have
much
confidence
in
the
truth
of
anything
that
they
say.
mr.
ben
margolis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ben
margolis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ben
margolis
yes,
i
participate
in
the
trial.
mr.
ben
margolis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ben
margolis
yes.
mr.
ben
margolis
yes.
well
as
i
recall
at
this
moment,
full
charges
--
proposed
charges
were
submitted
by
the
government
and
by
the
defendants.
that
was
then
i
think
--
mr.
ben
margolis
well
in
advance
of
it.
they
were
then
--
i
think
we
had
the
jury
dismissed
for
a
day
or
two,
i
don't
recall
how
long
and
we
argue
those
and
the
judge
indicated
“i
will
give
this,
i
will
give
that”
and
before
the
instructions
were
given,
we
have
in
our
hands
a
modified
set
of
the
instructions
as
the
judge
intended
to
give
that.
we
had
also
indicated
--
mr.
ben
margolis
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
and
he
--
we
knew
in
advance
of
our
argument
what
he
was
going
to
give
with
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
have
stated
our
objections
to
them
so
fully
that
after
the
charge,
i
believe
that
for
the
most
part
we
simply
referred
back
to
objections
which
had
been
previously
made,
everybody
agreed
that
that
procedure
would
be
acceptable
in
order
to
save
time.
mr.
ben
margolis
no,
your
honor
we
knew
everything
that
he
was
going
to
charge
before
he
charge
it.
mr.
ben
margolis
fully.
mr.
ben
margolis
he
gave
us
a
written
document.
mr.
ben
margolis
setting
forth
what
he
was
going
to
charge.
we
--
we
incidentally
make
no
--
we
--
out
complaint
is
about
the
content.
mr.
ben
margolis
well,
it
was
very
thoroughly
considered.
mr.
ben
margolis
for
most
of
the
judges,
yes.
mr.
ben
margolis
for
most
of
the
judges
or
to
indicate
fairly
specifically
what
he's
going
to
--
what
he's
going
to
say.
mr.
ben
margolis
well,
lawyers
that
tried
cases
think
it
is
a
wise
thing.
mr.
ben
margolis
think
it
is?
mr.
ben
margolis
think
it
is.
well,
i
--
i
--
sorry
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
specific
incidents,
but
only
time
prevents
me
from
doing
so,
they're
fully
covered
in
the
brief.
now,
i
want
to
turn
to
--
i
want
to
say
this
before
leaving
these
specific
incidents.
these
specific
incidents
involved
only
five
of
the
petitioners
and
are
in
no
way
tied
up
to
the
other
six
unless
any
statement
made
by
any
communist
is
--
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
was
made
by
communist
attributable
to
any
other
communist.
it's
--
it's
tied
in
to
the
other
six
in
no
way
whatsoever.
it
has
not
shown
that
they
knew
of
them,
it
has
not
shown
that
they
approved
of
them.
it
is
not
shown
that
they
had
anything
whatsoever
to
do
with
these
statements.
and
with
respect
to
the
six
of
the
petitioners,
it
is
our
position
that
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
record
other
than
evidence
of
party
membership,
the
holding
of
a
kind
of
offices
that
i
have
indicated
to
you
prior
and
innocent
activities
within
the
party
such
as
supporting
certain
types
of
legislation
and
it
is
true
in
some
instances
distributing
marxist-leninist
books
but
never
with
any
advocacy
or
any
interpretation
of
them
has
advocated
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
now,
even
as
to
these
six,
the
respondent's
position
is
that
the
evidence
is
ample.
it
is
our
position
however,
that
unless
the
nature
of
petitioner's
activities
is
given
no
weight
than
they
were
given
weight
in
dennis
that
unless
section
4
(f)
of
the
internal
security
act
which
is
a
new
provision
since
dennis
and
which
provides
that
membership
per
se
is
not
criminal,
membership
of
a
communist
party
per
se
is
not
criminal
unless
that
proposition
and
the
proposition
of
guilt
is
personal
or
both
abandoned,
unless
the
requirement
of
clear
and
unequivocal
proof
where
first
amendment
rights
are
involved
is
discarded
unless
the
clear
presentation
of
rule
is
completely
abolished
and
unless
a
presumption
of
guilt
is
substituted
for
a
presumption
of
innocence
so
far
as
communists
are
concerned,
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
support
the
conviction.
the
membership
in
a
conspiracy
consists
of
adherents
to
an
agreement,
to
a
common
agreement
here
to
an
agreement
to
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
membership
and
officership
in
the
communist
party
is
not
the
equivalent
of
although
the
respondent
treats
it
as
the
equivalent
of
adherents
to
an
agreement
to
violate
the
law
in
that
respect
or
in
any
other
respect.
nor
is
leadership.
some
point
is
made
in
the
reply
brief
of
these
people
weren't
merely
members
and
officers.
they
were
leaders
of
the
party.
well
they
were
leaders
i
suppose
in
a
small
way,
but
at
least
absent
evidence
of
use
of
that
leadership
towards
the
forbidden
objective
the
fact
that
they
were
leaders
lends
not
one
iota
of
support
to
the
respondent
case.
because
our
position
is
that
if
membership
in
the
communist
party
is
per
se
lawful
and
if
the
activities
which
are
engaged
in
are
per
se
lawful,
you
cannot
by
combining
the
two
create
some
kind
of
a
chemical
reaction
which
imposes
criminology
upon
the
compound
resulting
from
innocent
membership
plus
innocent
activities,
but
this
is
precisely
the
government's
theory
here.
now,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
main
basis
for
the
respondent's
position
is
to
follow.
these
people
were
long
time
members,
officers
of
the
communist
party.
communist
party
adheres
to
marxism-leninism
reasonable
to
infer
that
they
knew
about
the
party
adheres
from
marxism-leninism
and
they
wouldn't
have
remained
long
time
members
and
officers
of
the
communist
party
unless
they
agree
with
that
adherence,
the
marxism-leninism.
next,
they
say,
“take
all
of
these
marxist-leninist
words.”
none
of
them
say
directly
and
this
is
an
important
point
i
believe,
none
of
them
say
directly
that
the
communist
party
or
that
marxist-leninist
theory
is,
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
should
be
overthrown
by
force
and
violence.
no
such
statement
can
be
found
in
any
of
these
books.
but
they
say
that
when
you
read
these
books,
this
is
the
only
possible
interest.
this
is
only
thing
that
marxism-leninism
can
possibly
mean
and
therefore
by
remaining
long
time
members,
officers
and
leaders
of
a
communist
party
these
--
they
can
be
inferred
that
they
agreed
with
marxism-leninism
and
interpreted
in
this
way,
became
part
of
a
conspiracy
they
have
in
their
requisite
intent,
all
of
that
series
of
inferences
drawn
from
their
continued
membership
in
the
communist
party
and
its
distribution
of
and
support
of
marxist-leninist
works.
well,
i
think
one
problem
with
this
theory
is
that
actually
it
broadens
the
conspiracy
beyond
the
communist
party.
if
under
it,
if
it
is
accepted
anybody
who
admits
adherents
to
marxism-leninism,
thereby
labels
himself
a
criminal
and
there
many
besides
communist
both
in
the
united
states
and
throughout
the
world
who
claim
to
be
adherence
of
marxism-leninism
and
who
fact
say
that
the
communist
have
started
marxism-leninism.
but
if
there's
only
one
possible
meaning
to
marxism-leninism
that
anybody
who
says,
“i
am
a
marxist-leninist”,
is
thereby
rendered
a
criminal.
but
it
is
also
contrary
to
the
law
and
to
facts.
it
forces
the
respondent
to
say
schneiderman
is
of
yesterday.
schneiderman
when
which
it
was
held
that
a
tenable
conclusion
is
that
marxism-leninism
does
not
stand
for
this
forbidden
advocacy.
and
there's
much
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
a
similar
finding.
but
i
like
to
spend
the
moment
or
two
on
just
the
basic
theory
that
of
the
respondent's
case.
if
you
will
examine
the
kind
of
passages
that
have
been
introduced
into
evidence
here,
you
will
find
that
they
are
one
of
two
kinds.
either
they
refer
to
force
and
violence
in
a
specific
situation
having
no
relationship
to
united
states
where
there
is
a
tyrannical
form
of
government,
where
there
are
different
historical
conditions,
whether
is
no
opportunity
for
changes
of
the
democratic
process
or
they
consist
of
the
broadest
kind
of
generalities,
talking
about
the
capitalism.
now
it
is
our
position
that
you
cannot
form
such
generalities
draw
a
conclusion,
that
they
have
only
one
meaning.
certainly,
the
first
amendment
is
such
a
generality.
congress
shall
make
no
law
abridging
freedom
of
speech
and
there
are
some
with
whom
this
court
is
familiar
who
have
said
that
can
only
mean
one
thing.
congress
shall
make
no
law
abridging
freedom
of
speech.
but
this
court
said
in
dennis
that
the
right
to
free
speech
is
not
an
unlimited,
unqualified
right,
but
must
on
occasion
be
subordinated
to
other
values
and
considerations.
yet
the
respondent
here
insist
that
as
far
as
these
petitioners
are
concerned
only
one
in
construction
and
that
the
construction
of
the
petitioners,
from
selected
passages,
from
selected
books
must
be
the
one
which
the
petitioners
adopted
even
though
there
is
in
the
record
here
a
great
deal
of
testimony,
a
great
deal
of
evidence
in
the
form
of
exhibits
and
a
great
deal
of
testimony
form
witnesses
including
their
own
witnesses
indicating
the
marxism-leninism
can
be
and
has
been
interpreted
differently.
one
of
their
principle
witnesses,
the
man
by
the
name
of
honig
said
that
when
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
he
was
a
high
official
in
the
communist
party,
he
believed
that
there
was
a
75%
chance
and
he
hoped
100%
for
--
for
peaceful
changes
to
socialism.
he
believed
that
violence
would
only
come
if
a
minority
started
against
the
majority
when
they
wanted
socialism.
and
that
he
had
talked
to
many
leaders
of
the
party
and
that
they
had
agreed
with
him.
if
there
is
one
--
one
thing
that
has
never
been
explained
here,
if
the
respondent's
witnesses
could
have
so
believe,
why
is
it
that
the
petitioners
must
be
assumed
arbitrarily
to
believe
otherwise
when
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
to
support
it.
i
want
to
turn
for
a
moment
to
the
instruction
on
sight
that
my
time
is
just
about
up,
and
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
most
important
thing.
both
the
government
and
the
defendants
in
this
case
asked
an
instruction
be
given.
that
the
law
punishes
only
advocacy
or
conspiracy
to
advocate
action
for
the
accomplishment
of
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
force
and
violence
by
language
reasonably
and
ordinarily
calculated
to
incite
persons
to
such
action.
now
this
is
--
this
is
the
instruction
that
was
given
in
dennis.
this
was
refused.
not
only
was
this
refused,
instructions
to
the
same
effect
in
various
other
forms
were
submitted.
and
the
trial
judge
refused
to
give
any
instruction
which
indicated
that
advocacy
of
action
as
distinguished
from
advocacy
of
abstract
doctrine
and
advocacy
of
ideas
was
the
kind
of
advocacy
of
which
the
statute
was
asked.
not
a
single
instruction
that
he
gave.
i
call
--
i
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
at
pages
and
i
hope
to
read
it
but
i
won't.
at
pages
69
and
70
of
the
respondent's
reply
in
the
mesarosh,
which
will
be
argued
shortly,
69
and
70.
this
same
respondent
in
another
case
in
which
the
issue
was
a
different
one,
the
issue
there
is
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
that
show
incitement
concedes,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
kind
of
instruction
that
we
ask
for
--
what
the
respondent
asked
for,
was
essential
to
a
proper
construction
of
the
statute
by
the
court.
because
what
this
--
what
the
court
left
in
the
minds
of
the
jury
was,
that
they
could
find
these
defendants
guilty
even
though
all
that
they
advocated
were
ideas
which
could
be
answered
by
ideas.
nowhere
did
he
make
it
clear
that
--
mr.
ben
margolis
yes.
i
--
i
can
give
it
to
you,
you
want
the
page?
mr.
ben
margolis
the
one
that
was
given
or
the
one
that
was
refused?
mr.
ben
margolis
well,
the
most
convenient
place
for
finding
them
is
in
the
printed
appendix,
and
your
honor
will
find
them
--
the
ones
that
were
given,
your
honor
will
find
at
pages
33
to
36
of
the
appendix,
the
printed
appendix,
to
appellants'
brief
in
the
court
below,
it's
a
green
volume
--
yes,
the
--
mr.
ben
margolis
the
ones
that
were
given
appear
at
pages
33
to
36.
there's
some
--
not
all
of
them
at
those
pages
deal
with
this
but
on
those
pages
appear
all
that
were
given
on
the
subject.
and
also
the
ones
that
were
refused
appear
in
the
same
document
at
pages
73,
74
and
76.
mr.
ben
margolis
yes
sir.
mr.
ben
margolis
as
found
by
the
court
as
the
basis
--
mr.
ben
margolis
--
for
its
decision
on
that
case,
yes.
mr.
ben
margolis
i
--
mr.
ben
margolis
i
think
that
--
maybe
i
understand
dennis
a
little
differently.
i
understand
this
case
a
little
differently
and
i'm
taking
a
moment
or
two
if
i
may
have
it
to
--
to
answer
your
honor's
argument.
mr.
ben
margolis
i
think
there
are
some
--
some
factors
that
they
require
answer
in
respect
to
your
question.
my
position
is
this.
dennis
did
not
find
and
did
not
hold
that
the
communist
party
was
a
conspiracy.
that
wasn't
the
charge.
the
charge
there
was
that
these
individuals
engaged
in
a
conspiracy
to
make
out
of
the
communist
party
a
certain
kind
of
a
thing.
mr.
ben
margolis
and
to
utilize
it
for
that
purpose.
that
was
--
now
incidentally,
the
charge
here
is
not
that
the
communist
party
is
a
conspiracy.
the
charge
here
is
the
same
insofar
as
that
goes
as
dense.
our
position
is
as
follow.
number
one,
the
charge
not
being
that
the
communist
party
is
a
conspiracy,
it
makes
no
different
what
findings
there
were
or
could
be
about
the
communist
party
and
number
two,
that
the
evidence
in
this
case
is
different
from
dennis
and
does
not
support
a
finding
from
--
it's
different
from
dennis
and
does
not
support
a
finding
that
the
communist
party
if
that
were
material,
is
that
kind
of
an
organization
and
i
want
--
i
must
say
this
first.
i
may
find
the
thing
that
perhaps,
if
the
court
had
reviewed
the
record
in
dennis,
it
might
have
had
doubts
about
the
sufficiency
of
the
showing
in
dennis.
but
in
any
event,
the
showing
here
is
not
the
same.
mr.
ben
margolis
i
--
i
would
very
much
like
to
see
this
court
reconsider
dennis.
mr.
ben
margolis
but
i
say
that
simply
by
following
the
limitation
which
dennis
imposed
upon
any
further
breach
of
the
first
amendment
--
fifth
amendment
because
dennis
frankly
say
that
the
--
the
first
amendment
has
been
impaired
to
some
extent
as
a
result
of
this
decision,
simply
by
saying,
“alright,
the
line
which
we
drew
in
dennis
is
the
one
which
we're
going
to
observe
in
this
case
requires
the
reversal
of
this
case
upon
the
grounds
of
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
and
upon
a
half-a-dozen
other
independent
grounds.
mr.
ben
margolis
my
associate
--
mr.
ben
margolis
that
will
be
argued.
mr.
ben
margolis
thank
you.
mr.
ben
margolis
mr.
donovan.
mr.
ben
margolis
if
the
court
please.
in
the
10
minutes
remaining
to
me,
it
is
simply
impossible
for
me
to
deal
with
the
numerous
misstatements
of
fact,
erroneous
statements
concerning
the
contents
of
the
records,
misleading
statements
by
omitting
portions
of
the
record,
which
were
included
in
counsel's
argument.
they
are
contained
in
the
brief,
however,
and
if
i
have
time,
i
will
refer
to
some
of
them.
i
want
first,
however,
in
the
time
remaining
for
me
to
deal
with
some
of
the
legal
questions
principally
with
some
of
the
instructions.
at
page
112
of
the
brief
for
petitioners,
the
court
will
find
in
a
footnote
the
instruction
which
judge
medina
gave
on
the
issue
of
in
kind
of
advocacy
proscribed
by
the
smith
act.
and
it
reads
as
follows,
“in
further
construction
and
interpretation
of
the
statute,
i
charge
you
that
it
is
not
the
abstract
doctrine
of
over
--
overthrowing
or
destroying
organized
government
by
unlawful
means
which
is
denounced
by
this
law.”
now,
let
me
stop
there.
the
defense
requested
the
trial
judge
to
advise
the
jury
that
it
was
not
the
abstract
doctrine
of
overthrowing
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
he
refused
to
give
that
--
that
there
was
involved
there.
he
refused
to
give
that
instruction.
true.
he
said
that
the
mere
holding
of
an
opinion
or
a
belief
or
a
prediction
or
a
prophecy
did
not
constitute
a
violation,
but
he
never
said
that
the
advocacy
of
the
abstract
doctrine
wouldn't
constitute
a
violation
although
he
was
specifically
requested
to
instruct
the
jury
that
the
advocacy
of
the
abstract
doctrine
of
the
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence
does
not
constitute
a
violation
of
the
smith
act.
then
they,
the
instruction
of
medina,
judge
medina
--
mr.
ben
margolis
and
i
will
deal
with
that,
your
honor,
in
a
moment.
i
--
i
wish
first
of
all,
i
think
there
are
two
questions
involved
as
you
indicated
yourself,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
one
is
whether
it
was
done
and
second
if
so
the
clarity
with
which
it
was
done.
i
submit
that
on
this
--
an
issue
of
this
important
the
defense
was
entitled
not
only
to
enact
a
--
an
instruction
which
is
susceptible
of
a
correct
instruction
--
correct
construction
of
the
law.
but
they're
entitled
to
an
instruction
which
specifically
and
explicitly
and
clearly
spelled
out
the
law
and
this
we
never
got.
we
never
got
an
instruction
which
said,
“that
abstract
doctrine
is
not
covered
by
the
smith
act.”
now,
let
me
go
on
with
judge
medina's
instructions.
now,
he
goes
on,
but
the
teaching
and
advocacy
of
action
for
the
accomplishment
of
that
purpose.
we
said
in
the
trial
of
that
case,
we
want
an
instruction
which
says,
“it
isn't
just
the
teaching
and
advocacy
of
ideas,
but
it
is
the
teaching
and
advocacy
of
action.”
he
refused
to
give
that
instruction.
at
no
--
nowhere
in
his
instruction
will
you
find
the
word
action.
medina
--
judge
medina,
however,
wasn't
satisfied
even
with
that.
he
went
to
say
--
he
went
on
to
say,
“by
language
reasonably
and
ordinarily
calculated
to
incite
the
persons
to
such
actions.”
we
ask
that
he
give
that
with
respect
to
the
type
of
language
to
be
used,
but
he
refused
to
do
so.
now,
let
us
take
the
instruction
that
he
did
give.
first
of
all,
he
gave
a
definition
in
which
he
stated
to
the
jury
that
the
word
“advocate”
and
the
word
“urge”
mean
exactly
the
same
thing.
he
said
the
word
--
and
here
i
am
referring
to
the
appendix
to
appellant's
brief
which
i
previously
referred
to
at
page
32.
he
said
the
word
“advocate”
means
to
urge
or
to
plead
in
favor
of,
to
support,
vindicate
or
recommend.
in
other
words,
he
threw
“urge”
in
with
all
of
these
phrases
and
definitions
which
include
the
urging
or
advocacy
of
ideas
as
distinguished
from
the
urging
or
advocacy
of
action.
never
once
did
he
say,
“it
is
action
that
must
be
urged,
not
an
idea
must
be
urged.”
now
let
me
point
this
out
from
the
standpoint
of
clarity
to
counsel
here
and
perhaps
to
me
if
i
hear
someone
say,
“urge
the
advocacy,
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence.”
it
might
mean
urge
action
to
accomplish
that
purpose.
but
one
can
also
urge
that
as
an
idea,
as
a
philosophical
concept.
the
word
--
use
of
the
word
does
not
limit
the
definition
to
a
situation
in
which
only
urging
of
action
or
advocacy
of
action
is
what
it
is
covered.
it
can
be
either
urging
or
advocacy
of
the
idea
or
urging
or
advocacy
of
action
and
therefore,
the
instruction
was
at
large
on
this
issue
and
it
permitted
a
conviction
for
the
urging
or
advocacy
of
ideas
as
distinguished
from
the
urging
or
advocacy
of
action.
now
--
mr.
ben
margolis
yes.
mr.
ben
margolis
which
was
more
damaging
almost
than
anything
else
he
did.
what
does
he
say?
the
holding
of
a
belief
or
opinion
does
not
constitute
advocacy
or
teaching.of
course
it
does.
we
were
told
--
we
wanted
an
instruction,
not
that
you
couldn't
hold
beliefs
or
opinions
but
that
only
advocacy
of
action
was
involved.
he
said,
“hence
the
smith
act
does
not
prohibit
persons
who
may
believe
that
the
violent
overthrow
and
destruction
of
the
government
of
united
states
is
probable
or
inevitable
from
expressing
that
belief.”
in
other
words,
he
said,
“you
have
a
right
to
say
that
in
your
opinion
this
is
probable
or
inevitable.”
and
then
he
goes
on
to
say,
“whether
such
belief
be
reasonable
or
unreasonable
is
immaterial,
prediction
or
prophecy
is
not
advocacy.”
so,
there
he
is
saying
there
certain
kind
of
ideas
that
you
can
urge.
certain
kind
of
ideas
that
you
can
--
mr.
ben
margolis
entertain.
but
he
says
--
he
--
he
does
not
include
within
those
ideas.
he
does
not
even
include
as
an
idea
that
can
be
entertained,
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence
as
a
duty
and
necessity.
he
doesn't
even
include
that
as
an
idea,
would
you
have
a
right
to
hold
and
a
right
to
urge
upon
others
for
acceptance
as
an
idea.
by
this
first
paragraph
--
by
this
first
paragraph,
he
eliminated
the
very
thing
that
we
say
--
of
a
he
--
he
removed
protection
from
the
very
thing
which
we
say
is
protected
under
the
first
amendment
which
dennis
said
is
protected
under
the
first
amendment,
to
wit
the
urging
or
advocacy
of
the
idea
of
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence
and
asking
people
to
accept
the
idea.
this
instruction
is
clearly
as
it
was
possible
for
the
judge
to
do
unintentionally
and
knowingly,
willingly
on
his
part
permitted
the
jury
to
return
a
verdict
of
guilty
as
to
each
of
these
petitioners
for
the
advocacy
of
ideas
and
nothing
more
without
regards
to
whether
or
not
action
was
even
urged
by
any
of
these
petitioners.
this,
i
submit,
is
a
clear
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
let
me
turn
now
to
a
question
--
mr.
ben
margolis
well,
we
think
that
the
court
should
still
reach
the
issue
of
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence,
because
that
would
dispose
of
the
matter
once
and
for
all.
it
would
not
merely
result
in
it
being
sent
back
for
a
new
trial.
but
if
the
evidence,
as
we
contend,
was
wholly
insufficient
then
what
should
be
done
is
that
the
matter
should
be
sent
back
with
instructions
to
dismiss
the
proceedings.
mr.
ben
margolis
i
--
i
would
say
this
because
as
a
practical
matter
when
the
case
was
concluded,
when
they
had
put
in
their
case.
they
have
chosen
their
course
of
action.
they
had
put
these
defendants
in
jeopardy.
they
had
gone
through
six
months
of
this
--
mr.
ben
margolis
they
had
put
them
in
jeopardy.
they
had
accepted
their
theory.
they
had
put
in
the
evidence
that
they
had
available.
at
that
time,
the
evidence
was
insufficient
and,
we
submit,
that
it
was
the
duty
of
the
trial
judge
if
the
evidence
was
insufficient
to
order
the
jury
to
bring
in
a
verdict
of
not
guilty.
he
should
have
done
that.
he's
having
failed
to
do
that
can
be
corrected
only
on
appeal.
mr.
ben
margolis
i
think,
if
your
honor
please,
that
the
answer
is
this.
that
the
--
i
--
i
think
that
the
court
is
done
both
things.
i
think
there
are
cases
in
which
they
have
discovered
errors
of
law,
held
the
evidence
insufficient
and
send
it
back
for
a
new
trial.
there
are
other
cases
in
which
they've
sent
it
back
with
the
instructions
to
dismiss.
it
seems
to
me
and
i
don't
think
that
this
was
a
case
in
which
the
government
held
out
anything.
i
don't
think
that
this
was
a
--
they
had
six-month
trial.
i
think
consideration
should
be
given
to
the
fact
of
the
burden
that
is
placed
upon
defendants
in
a
situation
such
as
this.
i
think
that
this
--
that
there's
also
been
the
theory
laid
down
for
the
government.
these
are
the
--
i
think
the
dennis
case
outlines
what
the
limitations
were
under
the
smith
act
prosecutions
consistent
with
the
first
amendment.
they
had
noticed
of
what
they
had
to
prove
and
i
submit
that
they
didn't
prove
anymore
because
they
didn't
have
anymore.
they
would
approve
more
if
they've
had
it.
and
just
to
put
these
defendants
through
the
burden
of
a
second
trial
if
this
evidence
is
insufficient
is,
i
think,
not
in
the
best
interest
of
the
process
of
justice.
mr.
ben
margolis
that
--
that
--
mr.
ben
margolis
may
i
--
may
i
answer
that
question,
mr.
justice
frankfurter?
mr.
ben
margolis
yes.
in
the
first
place,
i
want
to
say
to
the
court
that
it
will
not
be
necessary
for
this
court
to
read
15,000
or
16,000
pages
of
the
record.
and
the
reason
for
it
is
that
the
references
to
all
of
the
material
testimony
will
be
found
in
the
two
briefs.
and
i
think
that
it
--
actually
as
far
as
the
material
testimony
is
concerned
outside
of
these
quotations
and
when
you
read
someone,
you've
read
--
many
of
them
are
simply
repetitious.
i
don't
assume
that
the
court
is
going
to
sit
down
and
spend
hours
reading
quotation
after
quotation.
leaving
that
to
one
side,
the
quotation,
the
evidence,
i
doubt,
if
it's
more
than
--
i
--
i'm
pretty
sure
it's
under
a
thousand
pages.
it
might
be
more
in
the
neighborhood
of
500.
you
see
this
--
this
record
was
filled.
this
--
this
case
was
a
trial
of
books.
this
--
almost
most
of
the
time
was
spent
reading
from
the
books,
the
jury
have
a
tough
time
keeping
its
eyes
open.
and
so
--
that
you
have
a
long
record
for
this
--
the
same
thing
that
happened
in
the
argument
here.
mr.
ben
margolis
however,
what
was
lacking
in
the
case
and
what
we
claim
is
lacking
is
that
there
was
a
lacking
proof
that
the
individuals
here
involved
put
an
evil
or
unlawful
interpretation
upon
those
books.
i'm
not
saying
that
books
aren't
admissible.
mr.
ben
margolis
well,
not
at
the
great
length.
there
were
--
there
were
quotations
that
were
read
six
and
eight
times,
same
quotations
for
the
jury.
there
were
quotations
which
are
repetitious.
the
same
thing
said
in
a
half
and
dozen
ways.
this
--
this
case
was
tried
so
that
the
jury
would
hear
the
word
violence
as
many
times
as
it
was
possible
to
get
that
word
before
the
jury.
that's
the
manner
in
which
this
case
was
tried.
as
far
as
the
time
spent
on
showing
or
attempting
to
show
any
connection
between
these
individuals
and
the
books
other
than
the
membership
in
the
communist
party
or
any
interpretation
which
they
gave
to
the
books,
well
it
just
none
of
it.
let
me
give
you
an
example
of
how
they
tried
this
case
and
this
happened
time
and
time
again,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
they
would
put
on
a
witness
and
the
witness
would
say,
“petitioner
or
defendant
so
and
so
taught
a
class
on
marxism-leninism.”
and
he
said
read
these
books.
that
happened
one
or
two
cases
or
in
most
cases
he
just
taught
a
class
on
marxism-leninism
and
not
mentioning
any
books.
(inaudible)
they
have
--
their
witnesses
were
there.
the
witnesses
were
sitting
in
the
class,
hearing
the
petitioners
teaching
that
class
on
marxism-leninism.
they
don't
ask
a
single
word
about
what
was
said
about
of
that
class,
about
how
the
petitioner
himself
while
teaching
the
class
construed
marxism-leninism,
oh,
no.
they
say
he
taught
the
class
on
marxism-leninism
and
then
they
read
marxism-leninism.
and
i
say,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that's
a
trial
of
books,
not
a
trial
of
people.
mr.
ben
margolis
that
the
differences
arise
primarily
upon
the
inferences
to
be
drawn
from
the
facts
and
there
are
a
few
instances
in
which
--
in
which
there
are
differences.
well,
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
is
that
you
will
find
in
the
two
briefs
the
references
to
the
pages
--
mr.
ben
margolis
--
that
we're
reading
and
i
think
that
you
will
find
that
those
pages
probably
run
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
500.
mr.
ben
margolis
thank
you,
your
honor.
