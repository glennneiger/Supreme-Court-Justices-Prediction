mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
of
yates
versus
the
united
states
is
a
contempt
case
arising
directly
out
of
the
smith
act
case
which
was
just
argued
before
this
court.
mrs.
oleta
o'connor
yates
was
one
of
the
defendants
in
the
smith
act
case
and
was
the
only
defendant
who
testified
in
that
case.
now,
there
were
three
contempt
cases,
three
separate
cases
of
contempt
arising
out
of
this
case,
all
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner,
yates.
these
three
cases
are
so
closely
interrelated
that
i'm
going
to
take
a
little
time
to
give
a
rather
complete
summary
of
the
facts
of
all
three
of
these
contempt
cases
even
though
this
court
is
only
concerned
with
one
of
the
three
cases.
and
i
think
that
when
you
have
heard
the
statement
of
facts
as
it
concerns
all
three
of
the
cases,
you
will
see
why
it
has
become
necessary
for
me
to
feel
that
i
must
burden
the
court
with
discussing
two
cases
that
are
not
even
before
this
court.
at
the
time
that
the
prosecution
rested
its
case,
all
of
the
defendants
with
the
exception
of
four
defendants,
rested
their
case
without
putting
on
any
evidence
at
all.
mrs.
yates
was
one
of
the
defendants
who
chose
not
to
rest
but
to
put
on
a
defense.
and
she
took
the
stand
as
the
first
witness
for
the
defense.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
yes
sir,
she
is
the
only
one.
and
she
testified
for
approximately
nine
days
on
direct
examination.
during
which
period
of
time,
she
testified
fully
and
completely
about
everything
that
she
had
ever
done
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
why
she
joined
the
communist
party,
what
she
did
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
what's
her
interpretation
of
the
so-called
classics
were
and
how
she
felt
in
what
her
intent
was
so
far
as
her
being
a
member
of
the
communist
party
was
concerned.
on
the
first
day
of
cross-examination,
she
was
examined
by
the
prosecutor
until
it
reached
a
point
why
she
was
--
where
she
was
asked
questions
for
a
number,
all
of
which
called
for
her
identification
of
other
people
not
on
trial
as
members
of
the
communist
party.
she
refused
to
answer
any
of
these
questions
which
called
for
identification
of
these
people
as
members
of
the
communist
party.
and
in
doing
so,
she
stated
to
the
court
that
she
admits
no
disrespect,
but
that
she
felt
in
these
times,
the
times
on
which
the
case
was
being
tried
that
to
identify
a
person
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party
might
bring
upon
that
person
prosecution,
persecution,
illegal
violence,
the
loss
of
a
job,
and
the
loss
of
many
of
the
other
privileges
which
citizens
who
are
not
a
communist
enjoy.
she
was
ordered
to
answer
those
questions
by
the
trial
judge
and
she
answered
in
effect
that
as
much
as
she
would
like
to
answer
those
questions
as
grim
as
the
consequences
might
be
for
her
refusal.
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
be
an
informer,
that
she
felt
that
this
was
what
the
government
witnesses
had
been
doing
in
the
case
and
consequently
she
couldn't
add
to
this
kind
of
testimony
and
consequently
hurt
anyone
else
no
matter
how
much
disposition
might
hurt
her.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
as
to
the
first
four
questions,
all
of
them
were
people,
three
of
the
questions
concerned
one
individual
who
was
not
a
defendant
and
one
of
the
questions
concerned
a
--
one
of
the
defendants
who
had
already
rested
his
case
and
her
refusal
as
to
that
particular
defendant
was
that
he
had
rested
his
case
and
consequently,
he
had
no
opportunity
to
meet
any
evidence
according
to
the
record
it
has
against
him.
and
she
felt
that
she
would
be
an
informer
in
identifying
him
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
so
as
to
all
of
the
refusals,
we
get
down
to
the
one
single
thing,
she
would
not
identified
people
as
members
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
from
the
question
of
admissibility
--
strict
technical
admissibility,
i
think
that
the
questions
were
irrelevant
and
immaterial.
however,
we
have
not
raised
that
question
here.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
i
think
we
must.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
we
made
objections
to
the
questions
but
that
is
not
a
point
which
brings
us
here
and
i
think
we
must
assume
that
for
purposes
of
this
argument.
at
the
time
of
her
refusal
to
answer
these
questions,
the
court
held
her
in
contempt
as
to
each
of
these
four
separate
refusals.
and
he
ordered
her
to
custody
for
the
--
until
she
answered
such
questions.
now,
all
of
the
defendants
at
that
time
were
out
on
bail
so
that
she
went
to
jail
and
during
the
rest
of
her
time
on
the
stand
and
during
the
rest
of
the
trial
indeed,
she
came
to
the
witness
stand
and
she
left
jail
and
she
went
back
to
the
jail
where
she
was
incarcerated.
now,
things
were
a
lot
smoothly
again
for
two
other
days
and
then
finally
of
the
third
day,
apparently,
when
the
prosecutor
was
lagging
in
his
cross-examination,
the
trial
judge
told
him
to
hurry
along,
that
he
was
wasting
time.
then
again
immediately,
upon
this
--
having
received
this
admonition
from
the
court,
he
started
asking
for
names
again.
he
asked
11
other
questions,
all
of
which
were
designed
to
elicit
one
thing,
the
identification
of
other
people
not
on
trial
and
of
some
the
defendants
who
had
rested
and
against
whom
she
had
previously
indicated
she
also
would
not
answer
the
question.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
yes.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
yes,
sir.
he
said
that
he
held
her
in
civil
contempt
that
she
would
go
to
jail
until
she
answered
the
question.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
yes
sir,
she
was
still
on
jail.
so
that
at
the
time
of
her
refusal
to
answer
the
11
questions
which
were
of
substantial
and
the
same
quality
and
upon
the
same
grants,
the
court
again
found
her
in
contempt
11
separate
times
and
indicated
that
he
viewed
these
findings
of
contempt
as
criminal
contempt.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
no
sir,
she
was
still
on
the
stand
the
third
day
of
cross-examination
and
he
said
that
he
would
differ
sentence
on
this
criminal
contempt
until
the
end
of
the
case.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
the
jury
was
of
course
there
when
they
refused
to
answer
the
questions
and
was
there
when
she
was
found
in
contempt,
but
during
the
time
of
certain
discussions,
the
jury
was
dismissed
while
these
discussions
were
carried
on.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
yes
sir,
very
much
sir.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
were
the
11
different
individuals?
no,
sir.
i
believe
that
there
were
about
six
or
seven
different
individuals
as
to
some
of
them,
they
refer
to
the
same
people.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
most
of
them
were
not
and
i
think
that
a
couple
of
the
questions
were
concerning
defendants
who
were
on
trial
but
who
had
rested
their
case.
they
were
the
--
some
of
the
11
defendants
would
--
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
that's
right.
some
of
them
were
not
on
trial,
had
not
been
on
trial
and
were
not
indicted.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
said
that
in
my
opinion,
it
was
irrelevant
to
have
asked
about
them
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
but
i
do
not
urge
that
point
here
because
we
didn't
come
up
on
that
point.
for
purposes
of
this
argument,
i
think
you
can
assume
that
the
trial
court
was
correct
in
ruling
that
the
questions
did
have
some
relevancy
while
i
disagree
with
that.
i
think
we
must
assume
that
for
the
purposes
to
be
resolved.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
no,
sir.
i'm
saying
that
i
--
that
my
argument
that
these
questions
were
irrelevant
is
a
tenable
argument
on
my
part
but
that
because
of
other
matters
which
are
more
important
and
more
significant
in
my
opinion
would
be
called
for
a
reversal
of
this
contempt.
we
did
not
urge
that
particular
point
before
this
court.
now,
when
he
ruled,
the
trial
judge
ruled
that
he
would
view
this
contempt
as
criminal
contempt
he
postponed
action
on
it,
until
after
the
trial
was
over.
as
the
result
to
the
experience
which
took
place
concerning
mrs.
yates
and
her
being
held
in
contempt,
no
other
defendant
took
the
stand.
the
defendants
rested
their
case
at
the
end
of
mrs.
yates'
testimony
and
she
was
in
jail
43
days
under
the
judgment
of
civil
contempt.
now,
when
the
jury
found
each
of
the
defendants
guilty
on
august
6,
on
august
7th,
the
trial
judge
sentenced
each
of
the
defendants
to
five
years
plus
$10,000
fine
which
was
the
ultimate
that
he
could
give
at
that
time
under
the
law.
on
the
next
day,
he
found
--
he
sentenced
mrs.
yates
on
the
criminal
contempt,
the
11
counts
of
separate
contempt
which
he
had
found
previously
and
he
sentenced
her
to
one
year
in
jail
on
each
of
the
11
counts,
but
that
11
counts
to
run
concurrently,
but
with
the
sentence
not
to
begin
until
the
termination
of
her
sentence
under
the
main
case.
in
other
words
it
was
not
to
begin
until
she
has
spent
her
five
years
that
she
has
been
sentenced
to
under
the
smith
act.
now
these
defendants
all
filed
notice
of
appeal
and
the
circuit
court
ruled
that
there
was
a
substantial
question
and
ordered
the
trial
judge
to
set
bail,
the
trial
judge
refused
to
set
bail.
we
went
back
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
they
themselves
set
bail.
we
went
back
and
posted
bail
on
behalf
of
each
of
the
defendants,
but
the
martial
would
not
release
the
defendant
yates
even
though
$20,000
bail
had
been
deposited
in
her
behalf
on
the
ground
that
he
was
still
holding
her
pursuant
to
a
judgment
of
civil
contempt
by
judge
mathis.
now,
at
that
time,
the
trial
judge
was
away
and
anther
judge
was
sitting.
this
judge
released
the
petitioner
yates
with
the
understanding
that
she
would
report
back
two
days
later
to
see
what
judge
mathis
wanted
to
do
concerning
his
judgment
of
civil
contempt.
it
was
our
argument
incidentally
that
at
the
time
that
the
trial
terminated,
the
finding
of
civil
contempt
terminated
and
there
was
no
longer
any
power
for
the
court
to
hold
her
pursuant
to
that
judgment.
so
two
days
later,
we
went
back
before
the
trial
judge
and
the
trial
judge
rules
and
he
wrote
an
opinion
as
a
matter
of
fact
which
holds
this
language,
the
language
which
i
am
about
to
recite
that
even
though
the
trial
was
over,
the
litigation
had
not
terminated
because
there
was
an
appeal
pending
and
it
maybe
that
the
government
would
need
the
benefit
of
those
answers
on
a
new
trial
or
at
sometime
in
the
future
as
long
as
the
appeal
was
pending,
the
government
had
a
right
to
those
questions.
and
consequently,
she
could
not
be
released
from
jail
at
all
as
long
as
an
appeal
was
pending
or
any
part
of
the
litigation
was
pending.
from
that,
we
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
and
asked
the
judge
to
set
bail
and
he
refused
to
set
bail.
again,
we
went
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
set
$1000
bail
on
this
contempt.
after
we
got
the
petitioner
yates
out
on
jail
on
$1000
bail,
judge
mathis
again
for
the
third
time
ordered
the
petitioner
yates
to
come
back
before
his
court.
at
this
time,
he
said
to
her,
“it
appears
that
my
sentencing
you
to
civil
contempt
had
no
effect
whatsoever
and
consequently
i
am
now
going
to
view
that
civil
contempt,
the
original
four-question
contempt
as
criminal
contempt.
now
i
sentence
you
to
three
years
in
jail
for
this
civil
contempt.”
so
that
at
this
time,
we
now
have
three
contempt,
first
a
filing
of
civil
contempt
from
which
the
judge
would
not
release
the
petitioner
from
custody
on
the
basis
that
the
government
still
had
a
right
to
answers
and
incidentally
in
our
opinion,
this
would
have
been
a
life
sentence
or
at
least
she
would
have
been
in
jail
until
today
1956
because
we
still
haven't
terminated
the
litigation.
and
the
one
year
sentence
for
the
11
counts
and
the
three-year
sentence.
now,
all
three
of
this
contempt
led
before
the
ninth
circuit,
as
to
the
judge's
ruling
that
the
civil
contempt
was
still
enforced
in
effect.
they
reversed
this
and
reversed
it
naturally
on
the
logical
ground
that
at
the
termination
of
the
trial,
there
was
no
longer
any
power
for
the
court
to
coerced
the
answers,
the
trial
was
over
and
the
answers
could
no
longer
be
given,
so
that
was
reversed.
as
to
the
three
years
sentence
of
contempt,
the
court
also
reversed
that
and
they
reversed
that
on
the
basis
that
it
was
a
violation
of
due
process
for
the
judge
to
first
hold
her
in
civil
contempt
and
for
her
to
spend
43
days
in
jail.
and
then
30
days
after
the
termination
of
the
trial
informed
her
for
the
first
time
that
he
was
doing
that
civil
contempt
as
criminal
contempt
and
consequently,
that
also
was
reversed.
the
one-year
sentence
was
affirmed
and
it
was
affirmed
on
the
ground
that
the
11
questions
of
the
third
day
of
cross-examination
constituted
a
separate
incident
of
contempt.
they
gave
no
reason
why
they
reached
the
conclusion
that
this
was
a
separate
contempt
from
the
first
four
days
and
this
is
the
contempt
which
brings
us
before
this
court.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
if
in
chronology,
it
was
the
second.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
it
was
the
one.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
at
the
time
that
this
arose,
she
was
in
jail
under
the
civil
contempt.
she
had
been
in
jail
three
days
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
she
refused
to
answer
11
questions
and
the
sentence
was
postponed
until
the
trial
was
over.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
one
year.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
no
sir,
the
order
was
that
that
would
--
she
would
not
begin
serving
that
until
the
termination
of
the
five-year
period
which
she
was
supposed
to
spend
under
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
validity
of
that
one
sentence
of
one
year
for
11
separate
contentions.
now
our
--
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
agree
with
you
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
i
cannot
cite
for
you
a
case
for
the
proposition
that
we
are
appropriately
here.
however,
in
the
sentence
of
this
crime
i
believe
that
there
is
no
question
about
the
fact
that
we
view
here,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
not
even
been
suggested
to
me
that
there
was
anything
to
the
contrary
and
your
question
raises
the
question
that
i'm
on
the
first
time.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
i
--
i
don't.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
the
only
answer
that
i
can
give
you
at
this
time
sir
is
that
we
are
appropriate
of
it.
now,
our
first
point
that
we
urge
upon
the
court
for
reversal
is
the
fact
that
there
was
never
but
one
contempt
in
this
case
if
there
was
any
contempt
at
all.
now
keeping
in
mind
the
fact
that
the
ninth
circuit
proved
that
the
only
reasons
they
affirmed
the
--
this
contempt
was
that
they
viewed
this
as
a
separate
contempt
and
they
are
completely
solid
as
to
one.
the
only
thing
that
we
can
suppose
is
the
fact
that
they
viewed
it
as
a
separate
contempt
because
it
arose
on
a
separate
day
from
the
other
four
questions,
because
even
the
government
admits
in
their
brief
before
the
ninth
circuit
and
also
their
briefs
here
that
the
questions
were
substantially
the
same
questions
that
they
called
for
substantially
the
same
answers.
now,
the
law
is
i
believe
that
once
an
accused
in
a
contempt
case
states
an
unequivocal
position,
once
that
person
shows
a
singleness
of
attitude
or
an
identical
nature
for
a
ground
of
refusal,
that
there
can
be
no
multiplication
of
contempts
by
the
prosecutor
or
jointly
putting
questions
to
her
which
will
call
for
the
same
answers
and
there
are
many
cases
along
this
line,
i
think
the
costello
case
is
one.
in
the
costello
case,
the
witness
in
the
beginning
said
that
he
would
not
testify
at
all.he
absolutely
refused
to
testify.
following
that,
the
questions
were
put
to
him
which
called
for
various
answers,
did
he
know
(inaudible),
did
he
know
frank
moran,
did
he
know
other
people
and
the
court
held
him
separately
in
contempt
for
the
refusal
to
answer
all
of
these
questions.
and
the
court
in
reversing
said
that
there
was
only
one
contempt
because
of
the
fact
that
the
witness
had
stated
unequivocally
that
he
would
answer
no
questions
and
that
the
prosecutor
could
have
been
in
contempt
a
thousand
times
by
asking
a
thousand
different
questions.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
that
this
exact
question
has
been
before
this
court.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
well,
we
say
they
cannot
do
that
and
that
is
in
effect
what
they
are
trying
to
do
but
they
disclaim
the
fact
that
that
is
what
they
are
trying
to.
their
position
is
that
her
refusal
on
the
other
days
was
not
the
same
thing
because
they
asked
different
questions
about
different
people
and
they
take
two
positions
that
no
matter
what
the
witness
says
in
the
beginning
about
a
refusal
to
identify
people
as
members
of
the
communist
party,
that
each
time
she
is
asked
a
question
concerning
a
different
individual,
that
is
a
different
contempt.
this
is
--
this
is
the
one
of
the
positions
which
they
take.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
that
is
my
position,
exactly.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
now,
does
your
question
assume
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
in
between
those
box
that
there
are
questions
being
answered?
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
no.
my
position
is
--
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
that
was
the
situation
here.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
yes.
but
my
--
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
that's
correct.
my
position
is
that
they,
which
determines
the
singleness
of
the
contempt
is
the
singleness
of
the
attitude
of
the
person
who
refuses
to
answer
the
questions
so
that
as
long
as
she
says
at
the
beginning,
i
will
not
answer
any
questions
which
calls
for
my
saying
that
this
person
is
a
communist.
then
no
matter
how
many
questions
or
how
many
intervening
days
went
in
between,
whenever
that
question
is
put,
it
is
a
continuing
contempt,
a
part
of
the
first
and
only
original
contempt.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
well
--
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
that's
correct.
if
she
were
here
--
if
she
announces
a
position
from
the
beginning
and
adheres
to
that
position
and
then
refusing
to
answer
the
second
question
says,
i
adhere
to
my
first
position
and
there
is
a
single
attitude,
a
single
impulse
which
motivates
her
attitude
towards
those
questions,
our
position
is
that
this
can
only
be
one
contempt.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
if
you
look
at
the
history
of
the
contempt
statutes
and
you
see
how
the
courts,
the
appellate
courts
have
very
jealously
protected
the
rights
--
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
all
right
well
then,
i
am
certainly
relying
upon
the
history
and
the
policy
of
the
contempt.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
that's
--
that's
what
--
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
that's
one
of
my
arguments.
but
also,
there
was
law
in
this
subject
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
the
costello
case
had
exactly
that
point.
now
it's
true
that
there
were
not
days
in
between
that
the
--
his
refusal
to
answer
the
question,
once
he
have
stated
his
position
that
i
will
not
testify.
but
i
don't
think
it
would
have
made
difference
in
that
case
if
he
had
been
on
the
stand
for
15
or
20
days
before
he
refused
to
answer
those
questions.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
the
third
day.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
if
i
understand
anything
at
all
about
the
law
of
contempt
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
it
is
this,
that
each
contempt
case
must
be
decided
on
the
facts
of
that
particular
case
and
if
--
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
the
costello
case
is
only
to
give
us
what
the
background
of
the
law
is,
the
background
of
the
logic
and
the
practice
is.
but
this
particular
case
has
to
be
decided
on
the
facts
of
this
case
and
as
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
there
is
no
question
but
that
she
didn't
change
her
mind.
each
time
that
she
refused
to
answer
these
questions,
she
refused
to
answer
them
on
the
same
basis
that
she
would
not
be
an
informer
and
she
would
not
name
any
of
these
people
because
it
might
tend
to
hurt
them.
now,
i
must
hurry
along
to
my
second
point
which
i
also
think
is
an
important
point.
that
point
your
honors
is
that
even
though
the
trial
--
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
yes.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
43
days.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
that
is
the
exact
holding
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
one
of
these
companion
cases
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
the
judge
had
held
her
in
civil
contempt
and
after
she
spent
43
days
in
jail,
at
the
end
of
the
trial,
he
called
her
back
and
he
said
you
are
still
(inaudible)
so
i
sentence
you
to
three
years
in
jail,
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
on
the
--
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
but
our
position
is
that
there
isn't
a
new
one,
it's
all
the
part
of
one.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
all
right.
now,
our
second
point
is
this,
that
even
though
the
trial
judge
labeled
this
one
year
contempt
as
criminal
contempt,
it
was
really
civil
contempt
because
as
this
court
well
knows
the
difference
between
the
two
kinds
of
contempt
is
one
is
punitive
and
one
is
coercive.
and
it
makes
no
difference
how
he
labels
it.
it's
what
his
purpose
was
in
giving
the
sentence
that
makes
it
either
civil
or
criminal.
and
we
say
that
even
though
he
labeled
a
criminal
contempt
that
the
purpose
of
this
contempt
was
to
coerce
the
answers
and
why
do
we
say
that?
because
at
the
time
of
the
first
contempt,
he
used
such
phrases
as,
it
would
not
be
fair
to
preclude
the
government
on
this
situation
to
establish
that
relationship.
to
borrow
language
from
some
of
the
cases,
you
carry
the
key
to
the
jail
at
your
own
pursuit.
you
may
purge
yourself
at
anytime
in
order
to
discharge
yourself
from
custody.
now,
this
was
the
time
of
the
contempt
which
unquestionably
was
civil
contempt.
however,
at
the
time
of
the
second
contempt
and
this
is
the
contempt
of
which
we
are
here
concerned.
the
judge
still
used
the
language
which
indicated
that
he
had
one
purpose
and
one
purpose
alone,
not
to
punish
the
defendant
in
order
to
vindicate
the
authority
of
the
court,
but
to
coerce
the
answers.
and
his
statement
at
the
time
of
sentencing
under
this,
when
he
allegedly
called
it
criminal
was
as
follows,
"i
had
hope
by
this
time
that
mrs.
yates
might
be
willing
to
purge
herself
that
she
might
be
prompted
to
do
so."
now,
the
government
was
entitled
on
cross-examination
to
show
if
they
could
--
what
--
the
person
that
mrs.
yates
said
impliedly
said
was
a
foolish
person,
was
a
friend
of
mrs.
yates.
we
don't
know.
that's
the
problem.
and
finally
he
said,
"i
hope
mrs.
yates
will
yet
purge
herself.
i
am
not
interested
in
imprisoning
mrs.
yates."
now,
the
fact
that
the
judge
made
all
of
these
statements
showed
that
the
judge
was
not
concerned
or
was
indicating
the
authority
to
the
court.
he
was
concerned
with
getting
the
answers
to
those
questions
and
this
intent,
and
this
motive
and
the
judge
might
even
carry
it
over
into
the
third
contempt
at
which
time
she
had
--
the
case
was
over,
he
had
it
over
30
days
and
he
called
her
back
and
his
questions
to
her
at
this
time
was,
“do
you
wish
to
answer
the
question?”
you
could
have
been
(inaudible)
mrs.
yates
by
answering
the
questions,
if
you
were
disposed
to
purge
yourself.
the
court
will
entertain
a
motion
to
modify
not
only
this
sentence
but
even
the
one-year
sentence.
now,
we
submit
that
in
the
court
making
all
of
these
things,
the
court
showed
--
even
though
the
court
was
been
held
that
it
could
then
coerce
the
answers
for
the
benefit
of
the
government
because
the
government
have
the
right
to
those
answers
once
the
case
was
over.
we
say
that
it
showed
that
the
court's
only
purpose
was
to
coerce
the
defendant,
yates
by
answering
the
questions
and
since
the
kind
of
a
sentence
that
he
gave,
even
though
he
labeled
it
criminal
was
for
this
purpose
and
this
purpose
alone,
it
was
civil
contempt
and
not
criminal
contempt
and
consequently,
the
one
year
sentence
was
illegal.
now,
i
only
have
a
few
more
minutes
and
i
wanted
to
discuss
point
three
which
is
the
excessiveness
of
the
sentence.
we
believe
that
the
sentence
is
so
inhuman
and
so
cruel
as
to
give
violation
of
this
defendant's
constitutional
rights.
in
the
first
place,
we
must
consider
that
we
are
dealing
with
the
question
of
summary
contempt
and
the
tremendous
possibilities
which
this
power
gives
to
a
judge
to
abuse
the
judicial
process.
the
history
of
the
contempt
shows
how
the
courts
have
jealously
guarded
this
and
every
time
a
case
comes
down
in
history
since
the
time
of
the
judge
next
trial,
this
power
of
contempt
has
been
restricted
and
restricted
and
restricted.
and
there's
a
reason
for
this,
because
of
the
fact
that
it
--
any
criminal
contempt
case
doesn't
have
any
of
the
benefits
of
the
bill
of
rights
such
as
the
--
the
indictment
or
jury
trial,
or
right
of
cross-examination
and
such
things
as
this.
and
consequently,
we
believe
that
the
power
which
the
judge
should
use
should
be
only
the
minimum
power
which
is
adequate
to
protect
the
dignity
of
the
court.
and
we
submit
that
after
the
defendant
has
spent
43
days
in
jail
at
the
time
the
trial
was
over
and
they
spent
additional
time
in
jail
because
of
the
trial
judge's
refusal
to
obey
the
orders
of
the
ninth
circuit
to
meet
that
she
stayed
in
jail
70
days
altogether
and
not
43
days
that
then
to
give
a
sentence
of
one
year
in
jail
on
top
of
this
was
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
and
especially
considering
the
fact
that
by
taking
this
attitude,
the
defendant
was
only
adhering
to
a
position
which
could
not
possibly
have
hurt
the
government
but
only
hurt
herself,
because
the
jury
was
obstructed
that
they
could
take
in
a
consideration
her
refusal
to
answer
these
questions
and
testing
her
own
capability.
the
jury
knew
that
she
had
refused
to
answer
these
questions
and
she
was
convicted.
also,
the
questions
which
she
were
asked
were
questions
which
--
on
which
the
government
have
been
put
in
affirmative
evidence
that
every
one
of
these
persons
was
members
of
the
communist
party.
now,
what
could
avail
the
government
to
have
to
come
out
of
this
defendant's
mouth,
the
fact
that
these
people
were
members
of
the
communist
party?
none
of
the
defendants
of
the
trial
and
none
of
the
counsel
disputed
for
a
moment
that
these
people
were
members
of
the
communist
party,
but
yet
they
sentence
her
to
a
one
year
in
jail
because
of
the
fact
that
she
adhered
to
this
position
of
conscience
from
the
very
beginning.
and
finally
on
this
regard,
i
want
to
say
that
this
sentence
of
one
year
is
grossly
under
proportion
for
what
any
of
the
states
here
can
say,
the
contempt
of
this
kind.
the
majority
of
the
states
provides
for
a
maximum
of
only
30
days
on
this
kind
of
contempt
and
the
defendant
had
already
spent
70
days
in
jail.
none
of
the
states
exceed
six
months
for
this
kind
of
contempt.
and
even
in
the
--
under
the
federal
system
when
the
process
contempt
was
permitted,
not
on
the
premise
of
the
court,
there
is
a
six
months
limitation
to
it.
and
the
final
point
of
the
excessiveness
of
the
sentence
in
this
regard
your
honors
will
be
presented
by
my
colleague,
mr.
wirin.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
i
believe
--
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
i
have
a
few
minutes
left.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
i
would
like
to
reply
very
briefly
to
a
few
of
the
matters
raised
by
the
respondent.
the
position
of
the
respondent
that
because
mrs.
yates,
after
first
stating
a
position,
after
first
stating
that
she
would
refuse
to
answer
questions
which
would
identify
people
as
members
of
the
communist
party.
as
i
understand
his
position,
it
is
that
because
she
later
relaxed
her
position
and
said,
"well,
i
want
to
be
of
as
much
benefit
to
this
court
as
i
can
and
answer
questions
as
much
i
can
and
still
maintain
my
position
of
conscience,
and
so
there
are
some
questions
that
i
will
answer."
because
of
that
she
could
committed
a
different
contempt.
now,
this
seems
to
me
to
be
that
our
fairest
position
that
anyone
could
possibly
take
because
for
example
if
the
witness
had
answered
all
the
questions
that
had
been
asked
her
on
direct
examination
and
at
the
time
of
cross-examination
she
had
said,
"i
absolutely
refuse
to
answer
any
questions,"
i
don't
think
there
is
argument
on
the
part
of
respondent
but
that
that
would
have
only
been
one
contempt.
but
here
is
our
witness
who
does
not
pick
and
choose
to
suit
herself
as
the
respondent
would
have
this
court
believe.
and
she
did
not
answer
questions
which
she
thought
would
help
herself
and
refuse
to
answer
the
questions
which
she
thought
might
hurt
herself
as
he
would
have
you
believe,
she
only
refused
to
answer
questions
which
came
with
that
a
narrow
refinement
which
she
herself
have
said
yes,
but
she
said
it
because
she
was
complying
with
her
position
of
conscience.
she
answered
all
of
the
questions
about
herself,
even
as
to
the
questions
about
these
particular
people.
she
admitted
that
she
knew
these
people.
she
had
--
she
told
about
how
long
she
had
known
these
people.
and
the
only
time
she
refused
to
answer
any
questions
at
all
is
when
the
answer
are
called
for
in
an
identification
of
these
people
as
members
of
the
communist
party.
now,
i
think
that
when
a
witness
his
willing
to
give
testimony
that
we
should
certainly
be
much
more
lenient
with
that
witness
than
we
should
be
with
a
witness
who
absolutely
refuses
to
give
any
testimony
whatsoever.
now,
the
respondent
would
also
make
much
out
of
the
fact
that
the
witness
answered
questions
about
some
of
the
--
of
the
people.
now,
what
was
her
position?
her
position
was,
"i
will
not
answer
questions
about
any
person
who
--
that
will
identify
these
people
as
members
of
the
communist
party
if
it
will
hurt
these
people."
now,
certainly
she
knows
at
her
own
mind
and
anybody
knows
that
answering
a
question
about
william
z.
foster,
the
head
of
the
communist
party,
a
man
who
was
not
tried
because
of
a
heart
condition
and
is
probable
that
he
will
never
be
--
be
tried
for
this
--
for
which
he
was
charged.
and
the
man
who
is
publicly
and
baldly
a
communist
that
she
could
not
hurt
that
person
by
testifying
that
that
person
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
it
is
likewise
within
the
knowledge
of
everyone
that
she
could
not
hurt
this
mike
quinn
by
identifying
mike
quinn
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
mike
quinn
was
dead.
so
naturally
in
order
to
show
her
good
faith
she
said,
"i
will
only
answer
about
people
whom
i
can
hurt."
she
would
have
been
in
bad
faith
that
she
had
refused
to
answer
the
question
about
mike
quinn
because
how
could
she
possibly
hurt
mike
quinn
who
was
dead.
so
this
shows
the
good
faith
of
this
witness
and
this
shows
that
this
witness
was
not
trying
to
protect
herself
but
was
only
trying
to
maintain
her
consistent
claim
of
conscience.
now,
as
to
one
other
matter,
when
the
court
sentenced
her
in
civil
contempt,
if
in
fact
this
was
a
--
a
one
contempt,
the
court
did
punish
her
twice
for
the
same
contempt
because
the
court
gave
her
three
years
for
this
contempt
because
when
the
trial
was
over
she
was
sentenced
to
three
years.
so
she
has
been
punished
both
civilly
and
criminally
for
this
one
contempt.
and
that
is
the
judgment
which
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
that
is
the
judgment
which
the
respondent
took
no
appeal
from,
so
as
far
as
that
judgment
is
concerned,
it
is
final.
so
in
this
particular
case,
the
witness
has
been
punished
once
in
civil
contempt
for
which
she
has
spent
70
days,
and
she
has
been
punished
in
criminal
contempt
for
which
she
--
she
was
given
three
years
and
that
has
been
reversed.
and
now,
he
can
come
back
say
that
she
can
be
given
one
year
for
a
contempt
which
was
essentially
only
one
contempt.
and
finally,
i
want
to
say
this
in
that
regard.
it
is
not
important
that
the
prosecutor
does
not
know
in
advance
which
questions
will
fall
within
this
refinement
of
hers.
it
is
only
important
that
when
a
question
is
asked
that
falls
within
this
confinement
which
she
set
for
herself,
that
it
goes
back
to
the
original
contempt
which
was
total
when
she
set
this
category
for
herself
and
it
is
only
one
contempt.
and
the
reason
for
it
is,
is
that
in
a
contempt
it
requires
as
in
most
other
criminal
offenses
an
intent.
and
if
the
witnesses
says,
"i
am
not
going
to
answer
any
question
concerning
this
particular
category,"
when
she
is
asked
a
question
50
days
later
or
100
days
later
or
about
100
different
people
as
long
is
that
question
falls
within
this
confinement
which
she
has
set
for
herself,
it
is
still
a
part
of
her
original
intent.
no
second
intent
has
come
about.
she
still
refuses
to
answer
the
question
because
of
the
original
intent
which
she
had,
not
to
answer
a
question
which
is
going
to
hurt
anybody.
i
submit,
your
honors,
that
this
petitioner
who
has
spent
more
than
70
days
in
jail
as
a
result
of
a
mere
claim
of
conscience
and
not
because
of
any
obstruction
of
the
court,
because
the
judicial
process
was
not
obstructed
as
a
result
of
this.
when
she
has
done
that
that
is
sufficient
under
the
law,
not
only
to
coerce
the
answers
which
the
court
was
really
trying
to
do
at
all
times
but
also
to
vindicate
the
authority
of
the
court.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court?
this,
like
the
case
of
yesterday,
is
a
case
involving
the
power
of
the
court
to
punish
for
contempt.
however,
unlike
the
case
of
yesterday,
it
involves
a
different
kind
of
a
contempt.
this
is
a
contempt
which
grew
out
of
the
los
angeles
smith
act
trial,
also
known
as
yates
versus
the
united
states,
which
was
argued
last
term
before
this
court
and
which
this
court
reversed
on
june
the
17th
of
this
year.
at
the
los
angeles
smith
act
trial
in
1952,
at
the
end
of
the
prosecution's
case,
ten
of
defendants
rested
their
case
without
putting
on
any
evidence
and
four
did
not
rest
their
case.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
mrs.
yates
was
one
of
those
four.
she
also
is
the
only
defendant
to
have
testified
in
that
case.
now
there
were
three
different
contempts
arising
out
of
her
testimony
and
i'm
going
to
take
some
time,
if
i
might,
to
briefly
summarize
each
of
these
contempt
cases
even
though
there
is
only
one
of
the
contempt
cases
which
is
before
this
court
on
petition
for
certiorari.
and
the
reason
that
i'm
going
to
do
is
because
i
believe
that
you
will
agree
with
me
after
i've
given
these
facts
that
these
contempts
are
so
closely
interrelated
that
one
must
know
what
happened
in
each
of
the
other
contempt
cases
in
order
to
properly
decide
this
particular
case.
mrs.
yates
testified
on
direct
examination
for
nine
days
during
the
course
of
which
time
she
answered
fully
and
completely
every
question
concerning
herself,
when
she
had
become
a
communist,
why
she
had
become
a
communist,
the
things
that
she
believed
in
as
a
communist,
the
things
that
she
had
fought
for
during
all
of
her
life.
on
cross-examination,
she
likewise
answered
fully
and
completely
all
questions
concerning
herself
and
her
own
activities.
however,
there
came
an
area
of
questions
which
she
refused
to
answer,
and
this
came
on
the
first
day
of
cross-examination.
she
was
asked
four
different
questions,
each
of
which
she
refused
to
answer
and
she
gave
the
reason
for
refusing
to
answer
these
questions
as
a
desire
not
to
become
an
informer
because
the
answer
to
each
of
these
questions
would
necessarily
name
someone
else,
someone
else
other
than
herself
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
and
she
believed
that
in
the
present
times
when
there
was
so
much
anticommunist
hysteria
that
to
identify
other
people
as
members
of
the
communist
party
was
subject
to
bring
some
harm
to
that
person
or
to
that
person's
family
and
perhaps
visit
physical
violence
upon
that
person
or
that
person's
family
and
she
could
not
in
good
conscience
bring
herself
to
be
that
kind
of
a
person.
this
in
essence
was
the
basis
of
her
refusal
which
she
spelled
clearly
to
the
court
on
the
first
day
that
she
refused
to
answer
these
four
particular
questions.
at
that
time
the
court
told
her
that
he
appreciated
the
fact
that
she
just
didn't
want
to
become
an
informer,
that
perhaps
the
jury
might
agree
with
her,
the
jury
might
understand
what
it
is
to
be
an
informer,
however,
the
orders
of
that
court
had
to
be
carried
out
and
consequently
he
directed
her
to
answer,
upon
her
refusal
to
answer,
he
ordered
to
jail,
to
remain
there
until
she
did
answer
the
questions.
so
that
she
remained
in
jail
for
the
rest
of
the
trial
which
was
some
43
days.
he
held
that
that
was
civil
contempt.
then
the
cross-examination
proceeded
for
another
three
days
during
which
time
she
again
answered
all
questions
concerning
herself
until
on
the
third
day
as
she
was
getting
–
as
the
prosecutor
was
nearing
the
end
of
the
day,
the
trial
judge
turned
to
the
prosecutor
and
said,
“mr.
nucum
you
ought
to
be
getting
pretty
close
to
the
end
of
your
cross-examination
now”
and
the
prosecutor
said,
“well,
i
intend
to
go
all
day
tomorrow,”
whereupon
the
trial
judge
said,
“you
are
just
waiting
time
now,
come
on
get
along
with
the
case.”
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
three
days.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
whereupon
--
whereupon
the
prosecutor
immediately
without
further
ado
began
to
put
other
questions
to
her
which
said
questions
necessary
called
for
her
identification
of
other
people
as
members
of
the
communist
party.
he
put
eleven
separate
questions
to
her,
which
she
refused
to
answer
and
said,
“i
repeat
these
–
this
is
the
same
kind
of
a
question
you
asked
me
the
other
day
and
no
matter
how
many
times
you
ask
me
to
identify
these
people
as
members
of
the
communist
party,
i
can't
bring
myself
to
do
so.”
the
court
at
that
time
held
that
he
treated
the
eleven
contempts
of
that
day
as
criminal
contempt
and
he
treated
them
as
separate
contempts
from
those
of
the
third
of
cross-examination,
from
those
which
had
jailed
her
civilly
and
on
the
first
day
of
cross-examination,
and
he
postponed
a
sentence
upon
that
until
the
end
of
the
trial.
now
this
was
on
june
the
26th.
then
on
august
6th
the
jury
found
all
defendants
guilty.
the
next
day
the
trial
judge
sentenced
each
defendant
to
$10000
fine
and
five
years
in
jail,
the
maximum
allowed
under
the
smith
act
at
that
time
and
on
the
same
day
or
the
next
day,
i
don't
recall
which,
the
court
sentenced
the
defendant
yates
to
one
year
in
jail
for
the
contempt
of
the
third
day
of
cross-examination
to
which
the
eleven
questions
which
he
had
ruled
was
criminal
contempt
rather
than
civil
contempt.
now
all
of
the
defendants
applied
for
bail.
bail
was
refused
by
the
trial
court.
we
went
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
held
that
there
was
a
substantial
question
and
ordered
the
trial
court
to
set
bail.
the
trial
court
still
refused
to
set
bail.
we
went
back
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
itself
set
bail
at
the
sum
of
$20,000
as
to
each
defendant.
however,
the
marshal
refused
the
release
the
defendant
yates
even
though
the
$20,000
bail
was
deposited
because
he
said
he
was
still
holding
the
defendant
yates
in
jail
pursuant
to
a
certificate
of
civil
contempt,
which
the
court
had
ordered
on
the
first
day
of
a
cross-examination
and
consequently
until
the
court
ordered
her
release,
she
was
in
jail
or
still
should
be
in
jail.
now
judge
mathes,
the
trial
judge,
was
not
in
the
jurisdiction
at
that
time.
mrs.
yates
was
taken
before
another
judge
who
ordered
her
release
upon
the
stipulation
that
she
would
present
herself
a
couple
of
days
later
before
judge
mathes
to
see
what
his
ruling
would
be
concerning
the
civil
contempt.
so
two
days
later
the
defendant
appeared
before
judge
mathes,
at
which
time
judge
mathes
ruled
--
asked
her
if
she
was
still
willing
to
answer
the
questions
which
she
had
refused
to
answer
on
the
first
day
and
for
which
he
had
jailed
her
for
43
days.
she
said,
“my
position
is
still
the
same
your
honor.”
the
judge
held
that
the
prosection
was
still
entitled
to
those
answers
in
spite
of
our
argument
that
she
could
no
longer
purge
of
contempt
the
trial
being
over
and
he
ordered
her
back
to
jail
where
she
was
remain
until
she
answered
the
questions
which
would
have
in
affect
been
--
may
have
been
a
life
time
sentence.
we
asked
for
bail
for
this.
the
trial
judge
denied
bail,
we
went
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
who
then
fixed
bail
to
the
sum
of
$1000
on
this
contempt.
she
got
out
on
bail.
after
she
got
out
on
bail,
the
trial
judge
summoned
her
before
the
court
a
third
time,
this
was
30
days
after
the
trial
was
over,
at
which
time
he
told
her
that
because
of
her
refusal
to
answer
the
questions
of
the
first
day
for
which
she
had
–
she
had
already
spent
43
days
in
jail
and
for
he
held
she
would
have
to
stay
in
jail
until
she
answered
and
for
which
we
had
just
got
her
out
on
appeal,
he
said
he
was
now
going
to
treat
that
as
criminal
contempt
and
he
sentenced
her
to
three
years
in
jail
for
that
contempt.
all
three
of
those
of
cases
of
contempt
went
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
the
contempt
which
called
for
her
staying
in
jail
until
she
answered
the
questions
on
the
obvious
ground
that
the
trial
being
over,
she
could
no
longer
purge
herself
and
that
since
that
was
civil
contempt,
the
government
was
no
longer
entitled
to
those
answers
and
ordered
a
reversal
of
that
contempt.
the
ninth
circuit
also
reversed
the
three-year
sentence
of
contempt
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
a
denial
of
due
process
to
the
defendant
yates
to
first
punish
her
in
civil
contempt
and
send
her
to
jail
for
43
days
incidentally
by
the
time
she
–
all
of
these,
she
was
jailed
after
each
one
of
those
contempt
citations
and
it
took
us
some
time
for
the
machinery
of
bail
to
get
her
out,
by
this
time
she
had
spent
in
excess
of
70
days
in
jail
because
of
these
contempts
rather
than
the
43
days
which
she
spent
prior
to
the
time
of
conviction.
at
any
rate,
this
three-year
sentence
was
likewise
reversed
by
the
ninth
circuit
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
a
denial
of
due
process
for
the
court
to
first
punish
her
civilly
and
then
without
giving
her
any
warning
or
any
notice
that
was
willing
to
punish
her
again,
after
the
trial
was
over
to
punish
her
criminally
for
that
same
contempt.
the
court
affirmed,
however,
the
one-year
sentence
of
contempt
and
to
repeat
myself
perhaps
but
in
order
that
we
might
get
the
complete
picture,
this
was
the
sentence
wherein
she
had
refused
to
answer
questions
on
the
third
day
of
cross-examination
and
which
the
court
at
the
time
said
that
it
was
going
to
treat
differently
from
the
contempt
of
the
first
day
of
cross-examination.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
that
is
the
appeal
that
is
before
us
today.
now
that
brings
us
here.
when
the
ninth
circuit
reversed,
i'm
sorry,
affirmed
the
one-year
sentence
it
stated
that
the
contempt
of
june
20th
to
with
the
third
day
of
cross-examination
were
different
and
separate
contempts
of
the
26th
of
june,
the
first
day
of
cross
examination
but
it
gave
no
reason
for
holding
that
these
contempts
were
separate
and
distinct
and
this
brings
us
to
the
first
point
which
we
argue
here
on
appeal.
our
first
point
which
we
believe
calls
for
a
reversal
by
this
court
is
the
fact
that
the
contempt
of
june
30th,
if
it
was
a
contempt
at
all,
and
i
say
‘if
it
was
a
contempt'
because
on
an
argument
which
i
will
make
later
i
think
that
i
have
a
very
valid
argument
that
there
was
not
even
a
contempt
permitted
on
june
30th
but
for
purposes
of
this
first
point,
i
want
to
assume
for
a
moment
that
there
was
a
contempt.
if
there
was
a
contempt
at
all
it
was
not
a
contempt
committed
on
june
30th
but
the
only
contempt
in
this
case
was
committed
on
june
26th
at
which
time
the
witness
said,
“i
will
answer
all
questions
excepting
questions
which
will
call
for
my
identification
of
other
people
as
members
of
the
communist
party.”
at
that
time
her
contempt
was
tolled
and
thereafter
the
prosecution
could
not
multiply
the
contempts
in
this
case,
if
the
prosecution
asked
her
to
identify
5
people,
11
people
or
5000
people,
this
is
the
holding
of
the
costello
case.
the
government
agrees
with
the
costello
case.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
even
though
they
were
different
people.
in
the
costello
case,
mr.
costello
your
honor
had
refused
and
stated,
“i'm
not
going
to
answer
any
questions
at
all”
and
thereafter
he
was
asked
three
different
questions,
one
question
did
he
know
one
person,
one
question
did
he
know
(inaudible)
and
one
other
person,
all
of
which
questions
he
refused
to
answer
and
the
–
he
was
held
in
separate
contempts
for
those
refusals
and
the
court
said
that
once
he
had
said
he
was
going
to
answer
no
questions,
the
court
could
not
multiply
the
contempt
by
holding
–
answering
questions
which
called
for
different
people,
and
consequently
there
was
only
one
contempt.
now
the
court
–
as
i
said
the
government
accepts
that
case,
but
yet
it
claims
that
that
the
yates
case
is
different.
i
don't
really
know
why
other
than
what
they
argue
in
their
brief
but
in
a
moment
i'll
attempt
to
show
you
that
in
my
opinion
that
has
no
merit
–
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
that
is
a
question
which
comes
up
in
my
second
point
if
i
might
defer
it
until
that
time
–
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
--
i
would
be
glad
deal
with
it
at
that
time.
the
trial
judge
in
the
case
mistakenly
considered
each
separate
refusal
as
a
separate
contempt.
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
treated
the
contempts
of
june
26
as
different
from
the
contempts
of
june
30th,
but
it
does
not
say
why.
the
government
argues
two
possibilities.
it
argues
that
the
contempt
of
june
30th
was
different
because
it
concerned
different
individuals,
the
costello
case
is
a
complete
answer
to
that
argument
i
believe,
but
it
also
argues
that
the
contempts
took
place
on
a
separate
day.
i
have
been
unable
to
find
any
cases
of
contempt
which
say
that
a
contempt
committed
--
a
question
which
is
answered
or
which
a
witness
refuses
to
answer
on
one
day
makes
it
any
different
than
a
question
which
she
had
refused,
the
witness
refused
to
answer
on
the
day
before
because
if
you
follow
that
logic
i
think
you
can
get
into
an
absurdity.
here
our
two
witnesses
who
testifying
before
a
court.
one
witness
refuses
to
answer
a
question
after
having
stated
his
position,
“there
are
certain
kinds
of
questions
i
will
not
answer.”
he
refuses
to
answer
a
question
at
4:29
on
one
day
and
the
court
because
it
adjourns
at
4:30,
it
starts
another
session
tomorrow
and
he
refuses
to
answer
the
first
question
out
of
the
box
the
next
day,
under
the
government's
argument
that
time
that
witness
would
in
contempts
twice,
two
different
contempts
merely
because
of
the
accident
of
the
case
–
of
the
questions
having
been
asked
on
two
separate
days.
another
witness
on
a
trial
in
the
same
courtroom
could
be
answered
20
questions
all
of
which
had
came
in
the
same
day
and
refused
to
answer
all
of
those
questions
and
that
witness
under
the
costello
case
would
be
guilty
on
the
one
contempt.
i
think
that
what
both
the
court
and
–
below
and
the
government
misses
in
this
case,
what
they
all
ignore
is
the
position
of
the
accused
in
this
case.
her
complete
singleness
of
attitude,
the
fact
that
at
all
times
when
she
refused
to
answer
questions
she
acted
with
a
single
impulse,
she
had
a
single
course
of
conduct,
she
gave
an
identical
nature
of
her
ground
of
refusal
and
i
believe
that
under
the
costello
case
and
under
the
plain
logic,
the
witness
cannot
be
held
in
contempt
many
times
because
of
the
accident
of
refusal
coming
on
separate
days.
and
that
–
yes
sir.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
she
did
not
use
the
same
words,
but
basically
it
was
the
same
reason
and
in
that
–
the
ninth
circuit
recognized
that
in
its
opinion.
it
stated
i
believe
that
on
the
other
day
she
was
asked
questions
of
a
similar
nature
and
she
refused
on
similar
grounds.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
mr.
justice
whittaker,
it
is
true
that
on
the
first
day
of
her
examination,
she
said,
“i
will
not
answer
any
questions
which
will
identify
anyone
as
communist
because
of
the
fact
that
the
answer
to
this
question
is
subject
to
cause
someone
some
damage,
a
loss
of
a
job
or
physical
violence
etc.
then
it
is
true
that
on
the
30th
she
did
add
to
her
answer
the
fact
she
would
identify
people
as
communist
wherein
the
answer
to
that
question
would
not
hurt
anyone.
it
is
true,
but
in
my
opinion
mr.
justice
whittaker
that
makes
no
difference
in
this
case.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
i
would
be
glad
to
answer
that
sir.
the
trial
judge
could
not
tell,
neither
could
the
prosecutor
tell,
whether
or
not
the
answer
to
a
question
would
hurt
anyone
or
not,
but
in
my
opinion
it
is
not
necessary
for
there
to
be
an
objective
by
which
the
trial
judge
or
the
prosecutor
can
know
whether
or
not
an
answer
to
a
question
will
hurt
someone.
the
fact
is
once
the
question
is
put
and
once
the
answer
makes
that
question
fall
into
the
category
of
the
refusal
that
the
witness
had
carved
out
for
herself,
it
becomes
a
part
of
the
original
contempt.
now
let
me
give
you
what
i
mean,
and
let
me
tell
you
why
that
should
be
the
policy
of
the
law.
a
witness
like
mr.
costello
who
says
i
won't
answer
any
questions
can
only
be
in
contempt
one
time
no
matter
how
many
questions
are
put,
but
here
is
a
witness
who
says
in
the
beginning,
“i'm
not
going
to
answer
any
questions
that
will
hurt
anybody”
or
rather
“i'm
not
going
to
answer
any
questions
that
will
identify
anybody
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party”
and
then
she
narrows
this
a
little
bit
by
saying,
“well,
i
will
answer
questions
of
people
who
can't
be
hurt
by
this.”
in
my
opinion
that
witness
is
showing
her
complete
good
faith
in
narrowing
it
because
if
she
had
refused
to
identify
people
for
example
like
william
z.
foster,
who
was
the
acknowledged
head
of
the
communist
party,
who
was
publically
a
communist,
which
question
she
did
answer
incidentally
mr.
justice
whittaker,
she
did
answer
questions
about
some
people
and
she
answered
a
question
about
a
fellow
by
the
name
of
mike
quinn,
because
in
her
opinion,
she
said
mike
quinn
is
dead
and
mike
quinn
can't
be
hurt
anymore,
so
i
have
--
i
will
name
mike
quinn.
i
think
the
policy
of
the
law
should
be
to
encourage
as
much
testimony
from
a
witness
as
possible
rather
than
to
discourage
that
witness
from
testifying
because
what
that
witness
was
doing
when
answered
some
of
those
questions,
and
i
think
without
weaving
her
position
was
showing
her
complete
good
faith
because
in
the
beginning
she
said
i'm
not
going
to
identify
anybody
who
can
be
hurt,
so
that
if
she
had
refused
to
identify
mike
quinn,
then
this
court
could
have
said
why
you
aren't
even
in
good
faith,
because
you
can't
hurt
mike
quinn,
mike
quinn
is
dead.
so
she
did
name
mike
quinn.
in
my
opinion,
the
policy
of
the
law
should
be
not
to
punish
her
by
holding
her
in
contempt
many
times
because
of
the
fact
that
she
did
identify
some
people
who
she
could
not
hurt,
because
if
that's
going
to
be
the
policy
of
the
law
that
the
safest
thing
for
this
witness
to
have
done
on
cross
examination
was
to
say
i'm
just
not
going
to
answer
any
questions
at
all.
and
so
for
that
reason,
i
think
the
fact
that
she
did
answer
those
particular
questions
is
of
no
significance
whatsoever
and
should
not
be
under
the
law
and
could
be
justice.
now
the
second
point
and
i
think
that
this
point
gets
us
to
the
point
which
was
raised
by
mr.
justice
harlan.
we
say
that
in
this
case,
while
the
judge
treated
this
attempt
as
criminal,
and
he
labelled
it
as
criminal,
actually
it
was
civil
contempt.
and
it
was
civil
contempt
because
of
the
way
the
judge
treated
it
for
the
purpose
of
the
punishment
here.
i
need
not
remind
this
court
of
the
difference
between
civil
contempt
and
criminal
contempt.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
purpose
of
civil
contempt
is
coercing
to
get
the
answers.
well
the
benefit
of
the
parties
seeking
those
answers,
while
on
the
other
hand,
the
purpose
of
criminal
contempt
is
not
coercive
at
all,
but
it
is
impunity,
it
is
to
vindicate
the
authority
of
the
court
in
order
to
deter
any
possible
future
contention
and
it's
not
to
coerce
the
answers.
now
let's
examine
what
happened
in
this
case.
as
i
said
it's
not
the
label
which
makes
it
criminal
attempt,
but
it's
the
character
and
the
purpose
of
the
punishment
which
controls.
this
was
held
by
(inaudible)
and
by
several
other
cases.
we
can
only
tell
what
the
essential
purpose
of
the
court
was
in
this
case
by
examining
what
the
court
said
and
what
the
court
did
at
the
time
of
the
sentencing.
now
at
the
time
of
the
first
contempt
which
is
unquestionably
civil,
nobody
disputes
that,
this
was
the
language
that
court
used.
to
borrow
language
from
some
of
the
cases,
you
carry
the
key
to
your
jail
in
your
own
purse.
you
may
purge
yourself
at
anytime
and
be
discharged
from
custody.
this
is
typical
language
of
civil
contempt,
carrying
the
keys
to
the
jail
in
your
own
pocket.
i
think
it
was
quoted
from
some
case,
the
name
of
which
i
cannot
recall
at
this
point
in
time.
also
the
court
at
the
time
of
ordering
her
back
to
jail
under
civil
contempt
stating
isn't
the
government
entitled
to
those
answers
which
she
according
to
the
orders
of
the
court
should
have
given,
and
in
case
there
is
another
trial
of
the
case,
if
she
should
elect
to
take
the
stand,
the
government
should
have
those
answers,
again
this
signifies
that
they
treated
this
as
civil
contempt.
now
what
did
the
court
say
at
the
time
of
the
second
contempt,
and
this
is
the
contempt
that
is
now
before
this
court,
the
contempt
which
he
labeled
as
criminal,
but
which
we
say
was
actually
civil
and
he
had
no
power
to
give
a
punitive
sentence
because
of
the
fact
that
he
treated
it
as
civil,
the
court
said
this
and
this
language
appears
at
page
of
the
transcript
of
the
record
and
it's
also
in
the
record
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
is
13541,
which
we
also
filed
with
the
court.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
yes.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
the
court
said
i
had
hoped
by
this
time
that
mrs.
yates
might
be
willing
to
purge
herself.
that
she
might
be
prompted
to
do
so
and
again
at
page
36
and
37,
the
court
said
i
hope
mrs.
yates
will
yet
purge
herself.
i
am
not
interested
in
imprisoning
mrs.
yates.
this
is
the
language
of
the
court.
well
why
isn't
the
court
interested
in
imprisoning
mrs.
yates
because
imprisonment
would
be
punitive
and
the
court
wasn't
interested
in
any
punitive
imprisonment
here.
he
wasn't
interested
in
vindicating
the
authority
of
a
court,
the
reasons
was
that
he
wanted
the
answers,
because
if
he
was
going
to
punish
her
criminally,
she
couldn't
purge
herself
from
criminal
contempt
as
he
says
here,
and
he
wouldn't
have
used
this
language
about
being
interested
in
having
the
answers
if
the
purpose
of
his
sentence
was
punitive
rather
than
civil.
now
did
the
court
say
at
the
time
of
the
third
contempt,
now
this
was
30
days
after
the
case
was
over?
the
court
said,
do
you
wish
to
answer
the
questions
at
this
time
mrs.
yates,
this
was
even
after
the
case
was
over,
you
could
end
it
all,
there
is
simply
mrs.
yates
by
answering
the
questions.
if
you
disposed
to
purge
yourself
of
this
contempt
and
obey
all
lawful
orders
of
the
court
i
will
entertain
a
motion
to
modify
any
one,
not
only
this
sentence,
but
any
other
of
these
sentences
heretofore
invoked.
and
then
at
the
time
of
his
written
judgment,
he
said
if
and
when
at
any
time
prior
to
defendant
release
from
custody
following
execution
of
the
concurrent
three-year
sentences,
the
defendant
shall
purge
herself
of
contempt
by
answering
under
oath
the
questions,
then
the
concurrent
three-year
term
of
imprisonment
herein
shall
ipso
facto
cease
and
terminate.
now
the
government
says
that
if
is
any
different
contempt
proceeding
and
has
no
bearing
upon
the
contempt
which
is
before
this
court,
but
we
say
that
it
does,
because
if
the
court
30
days
after
a
trial
is
over,
when
it
is
no
longer
possible
to
recall
the
jury
in
that
case,
is
still
interested
in
getting
the
answers
and
tells
her
he
hopes
that
--
does
she
still
want
to
answer
the
questions.
and
he
hopes
that
she
would
purge
herself.
in
my
opinion
it
has
very
distinct
bearing
upon
the
question
which
was
asked,
rather
has
distinct
bearing
upon
how
the
court
felt
at
the
time
of
the
first
sentence.
now
to
get
specifically
to
the
question
which
mr.
justice
harlan
asked?
the
court
–
the
government
argues
that
even
if
it
was
one
contempt,
the
court
could
treat
the
contempt
both
civilly
and
permanently,
because
it
maybe
a
continuing
attempt,
and
it
cites
the
united
mine
workers
case.
i
believe
that
the
answer
to
that
is,
that
in
the
first
place,
the
contempt
was
not
continuing,
that
the
questions
which
she
refused
to
answer
on
june
30th
was
not
a
contempt,
but
was
only
a
reiteration
of
the
position
which
she
had
stated
on
june
the
26th
and
that
no
contempt
was
committed
at
that
time,
and
if
there
was
a
contempt,
the
contempt
was
committed
on
june
the
26th.
and
if
you
can
say
that
the
court
has
the
power
to
punish
both
civilly
and
criminally
for
one
contempt,
the
court
did
attempt
to
do
so
in
this
case
because
the
court
attempted
to
treat
the
civil
contempt
as
criminal
by
giving
a
three-year
sentence,
so
that
if
there
is
only
contempt,
the
court
has
held
her
in
jail
for
the
43
days.
it
has
given
her
a
three-year
sentence
for
the
same
contempt,
which
sentence
was
reversed
by
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
which
sentence
is
now
final,
the
government
did
not
appeal
from
that,
and
that
is
the
law
of
this
case.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
that
is
exactly
our
position.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
--
yes
it
does,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
argument
about
that.
the
only
argument
that
the
government
makes
against
that
is
it
says
that
on
june
30th
she
narrowed
her
refusal
by
naming
some
people
after
saying
she
would
not
name
anyone.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
that's
correct
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
the
record
--
the
asking
of
the
question
mr.
justice
frankfurter
does
not
establish
that
it
falls
within
that
category,
but
the
answer,
makes
it
obvious
that
it
does,
and
it's
the
answer
which
is
important
and
not
the
question
and
i'll
give
you
an
example.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
that
is
the
fact.
now
to
give
you
an
example
of
what
i
was
talking
about
a
minute
ago,
wherein
the
question
is
not
the
thing
that
is
important,
but
as
long
as
the
answer
makes
it
fit
within
that
category
then
it
becomes
a
part
of
the
initial
and
only
contempt.
suppose
the
witness
had
said
i
am
going
to
testify
fully
and
completely
about
everything,
but
i
am
not
going
to
answer
any
questions
concerning
a
member
of
my
family,
now
that's
pretty
clear
that
this
witness
will
answer
all
questions,
but
this
witness
just
isn't
going
to
be
an
informer
on
his
family.
the
prosecutor
has
no
way
of
knowing
who
belongs
to
that
family
and
he
starts
putting
names,
joe
jones,
joe
smith
and
so
forth
and
so
forth
and
she
gets
to
some
question
she
answers
some
question
and
she
refuses
answer.
the
prosecutor
cannot
then
say
well
i
didn't
know
that
joe
jones
was
a
member
of
your
family,
so
i
think
the
fact
that
she
spells
out
the
area
is
the
only
thing
that
is
important,
and
as
long
as
the
refusal
to
answer
specific
questions
thereafter
falls
within
the
area
which
she
has
spelled
out
for
herself,
and
it
is
a
question
of
good
faith
and
here
i
don't
think
there
is
--
undoubtedly
there
was
good
faith
and
all
of
the
people
whom
she
refused
to
answer,
i
think
then
that
there
is
only
one
contempt
committed.
now
i
get
to
my
third
point,
this
is
that
the
sentence
in
this
case
was
arbitrarily
imposed
and
was
a
gross
use
of
discretion
and
constituted
a
cruel
and
inhuman
punishment.
and
now
i
come
to
a
part
of
my
argument
which
i
said
from
the
beginning
what
i
argued,
point
one
i
said
for
purposes
of
that
argument
i
was
going
to
assume
that,
that
was
a
contempt.
here
i
am
going
to
argue
and
i
think
with
much
validity,
that
there
was
no
punishable
contempt
in
this
case
at
all.
now
we
have
to
remember
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
summary
contempt
power
of
the
court,
a
power
which
offers
tremendous
possibilities
of
abuse,
and
that
congress
and
the
courts
have
recognized
this,
beginning
with
the
first
judiciary
act
of
1789
and
then
following
the
famous
impeachment
of
judge
peck,
we
had
the
act
of
march
2,
1831;
and
finally
what
we
know
is
18
u.s.c
401.
this
does
not
involve
a
question
of
the
power
of
the
court
to
punish
for
contempt.
of
course
a
court
has
the
power
to
punish
for
contempt,
but
i
say
that,
that
power
is
strictly
construed
by
section
401
of
18
u.s.c
and
by
the
cases
which
have
drastically
curtailed
the
power
of
the
court.
and
the
reason
the
court
had
been
so
zealous
in
guarding
the
rights
of
individuals
in
this
kind
of
contempt
because
it
is
summary
contempt,
where
we
don't
have
the
protection
of
the
bill
of
rights,
we
don't
have
that
kind
of
indictment.
we
don't
have
that
confrontation
of
witness,
the
right
of
cross
examination,
and
the
right
to
be
found
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
but
here
the
judge
acts
as
--
he
acts
as
the
person
bringing
the
indictment,
the
prosecutor
and
the
sentencing
judge.
whey
then,
we
ask
this
extraordinary
power?
the
only
reason
this
extraordinary
power
was
given
to
the
court
is
in
order
to
prevent
an
obstruction
to
the
performance
of
the
judicial
process.
and
the
cases
of
henry
hudgins
and
the
michael's
case
which
i've
cited
in
my
brief
make
clear
that
obstruction
of
the
judicial
process
is
a
necessary
element
which
must
be
found
in
every
summary
contempt
case
before
the
court
has
a
new
power
to
punish
for
contempt.
if
the
conduct
did
not
obstruct,
then
the
use
of
the
contempt
power
is
not
justified.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
i'm
talking
about
summary
contempt
power
now
which
is
contempt
which
is
in
the
view
of
the
judge,
and
which
it
says
in
his
discretion
i
think
you
have
to
read
in
that
section
which
says,
at
his
discretion
whether
or
not
there
was
any
obstruction.
the
restriction
does
not
say
that
there
must
be
obstruction,
but
the
cases
say
that
there
must
be
obstruction
in
other
cases.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
that
is
true,
but
--
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
yes.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
because
three
is
the
only
--
perhaps
i
can
be
corrected.
is
not
three
the
section
which
says
--
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
that's
what
i
thought.
if
you
read
those
sections,
it
is
the
only
section
that
you
could
possibly
under.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
yes.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
the
certificate
--
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
the
certificate
of
contempt
recites
that
in
topology
with
rule
42(a),
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
18
u.s.c.a.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
this
is
on
page
three
of
the
transcript
of
records.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
in
conformity
with
rule
42(a)
of
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
18
u.s.c.a
i
hereby
certify
that
on
june
30,
1952
the
series
of
criminal
contempt
set
forth
below
consisting
of
the
refusal
of
the
defendant
oleta
o'connor
yates
to
answer
proper
and
relevant
questions
put
to
her
on
cross
examination,
were
committed
in
the
actual
presence
of
the
court
and
were
seen
or
heard
by
the
court
during
the
trial
of
the
case
of
the
united
states
versus
schneiderman
et
al.,
numbers
22131
cd.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
then
it
says
the
specifications.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
yes.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
you
are
correct,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
i
had
confused
one
--
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
yes,
it's
a
refusal
of
an
order
it
is
a
contention.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
my
point
is
that
--
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
i
want
to
face
everything
mr.
justice
--
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
i
agree
with
you
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
yes,
i
had
confused
what
i
had
thought
what
was
in
three
was
what
was
in
number
one,
and
that's
why
i
said
three,
when
actually
all
the
time
i
did
mean
one
because
of
the
fact
that
it
is
the
only
section
which
has
in
the
presence
of
the
court,
and
i
do
insist
on
it.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
i
do
not
have
the
--
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
no,
nothing
is
said
about
misbehavior
other
than
the
fact
that
there
was
a
refusal
to
answer
proper
and
relevant
questions.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
yes,
a
finding
of
contempt
based
upon
that,
but
the
words
misbehavior
are
not
used
mr.
justice
burton
and
the
court
did
not
in
anytime
of
its
certificate
find
misbehavior
other
than
him
stating
that
there
was
a
refusal
to
answer
the
questions
and
it
did
not
at
any
time
state
that
there
was
any
obstruction
--
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
of
the
record
mr.
justice
douglas?
yes
it
is
in
the
judgment.
he
does
have
the
language
--
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
no
sir
everybody
--
if
you
want
to
call
the
refusal
to
answer
questions
as
misbehavior,
it
can
be
argued
that
this
is
misbehavior,
but
other
than
that
kind
of
misbehavior,
nobody
argues
that
there
was
any
misbehavior,
there
was
no
respect
--
no
disrespect.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
government
concedes
and
the
record
bears
out
the
fact
there
was
the
utmost
respect
for
the
court
in
every
way
other
than
the
fact
that
the
witness
just
would
not
violate
her
conscious
by
answering
questions
which
she
had
said
she
would
not
answer.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
in
the
meaning
of
what
cases
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
both
of
those
cases
had
to
do
with
perjury.
the
trial
court
in
both
of
those
cases
felt
that
a
witness
was
committing
perjury
and
was
knowingly
committing
perjury
and
in
that
case
the
court
held
that
because
on
the
perjury
that
it
necessarily
obstructed
the
processes
of
the
court
and
he
found
them
in
contempt,
but
the
court
in
reversing
both
of
those
cases
said
that
perjury
in
and
of
itself
does
not
necessarily
constitute
an
obstruction,
but
there
must
be
some
other
element
present
in
the
case
which
was
not
present
in
the
case
and
either
of
those
to
this
cases.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
applying
that
to
the
case
at
hand
i
believe
that
we
have
a
stronger
case,
than
either
the
michael's
case
or
the
hudgins
cases
because
of
the
fact
that
i
can
conceive
of
perjury,
not
giving
truthful
answers
possibly
being
an
obstruction
to
the
purposes
of
the
court,
but
we
have
to
look
at
what
happened
in
this
case.
there
was
a
refusal
to
answer
these
questions.
the
question
were
of
dubious
relevancy,
because
of
the
fact
that
when
the
questions
were
asked
it's
obvious
from
the
record
that
these
question
were
only
asked
for
the
purpose
of
getting
names
and
the
work.
it
was
not
connected
up
with
the
evidence
in
the
case
in
anyway
whatsoever.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
to
the
people
whom
she
identified
as
communist,
they
did
not
attempt
to
come
up
and
follow
this
up
by
showing
some
connection
with
these
people
on
their
case,
so
that
--
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
this
was
cross
examination
of
the
defense
witness
and
not
a
part
of
a
main
case
and
another
thing
that
shows
that
there
was
no
obstruction
in
this
case
mr.
justice
douglas
is
the
fact
that
while
she
refused
to
identify
certain
people
as
members
of
the
communist
party,
she
never
denied
that
they
were
members
of
the
communist
party.
she
just
wouldn't
affirm
it
with
her
own
lips
and
there
was
much
other
evidence
in
the
record
to
--
which
was
undisputed,
which
we
never
attempted
to
meet
in
anyway,
counsel
didn't
even
attempt
to
meet
it
in
its
argument,
in
order
to
show
that
this
was
something
which
the
government
just
wanted
to
get
from
her
lips
and
it
didn't
add
anything
to
the
case
whatsoever.
as
a
matter
of
fact
at
the
conclusion
of
the
--
it
only
heard
the
defendant,
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial,
the
trial
judge
instructed
the
jury
that
they
could
take
into
consideration
her
refusal
to
answer
these
questions
in
judging
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses
on
testimony
and
the
jury
brought
back
a
verdict
of
guilty
in
the
case
so
that
i
can't
say
how
this
record
shows
that
there
was
any
obstruction
at
all
upon
her
refusal
to
answer
--
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
yes.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
yes
sir
it
does.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
well
the
record
was
over
15,000
--
you
mean
the
trial
transcript
that
appears,
it
does
not
appear
in
the
record
which
was
before
the
--
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
on
the
main
case
--
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
yes,
i
can't
tell
you
the
specific
case
that
it
appears
in
the
--
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
--
but
i
can
tell
you
how
it
appears.
witnesses
took
the
stand
and
testimony
was
allowed
from
those
witness.
they
went
to
various
schools
where
a
class
was
taught
by
the
communist
leader
joe
doakes
who
said
such
and
such
a
thing.
we've
put
on
no
evidence
in
the
record
at
all
to
dispute
that
the
joe
doakes
did
say
such
and
such
a
thing
or
that
the
joe
doakes
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
so
that
this
was
in
the
government's
case
and
she
is
undisputed.
we
did
not
touch
on
that
when
we
put
all
the
witness
understand
on
direct
examination
but
on
cross
examination
the
government
asked
the
witness,
do
you
know
joe
doakes
who
was
mentioned
in
such
and
such
a
testimony,
the
witness
said
yes
i
know
joe
doakes.
was
joe
doakes
a
member
of
a
communist
party,
it
was
there
where
she
refused
to
answer
at
that,
it
is
in
that
context
that
it
appears.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
it
maybe
in
some
instances
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
but
in
this
case
on
this
record
it
was
totally
unimportant
and
insignificant.
now
i
want
to
spend
just
a
few
minutes
on
my
last
point
--
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
that
is
exactly
my
position.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
no
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
court
did
in
the
hudgins
case.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
i
think
not,
because
i
believe
that
obstruction
must
be
present
in
every
contempt
case
and
that
the
hudgins
case
so
holds.
now
on
my
final
point
and
that
is
the
--
and
i
do
want
to
save
a
few
minutes
for
a
possible
rebuttal.
yes
sir.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
no
sir
that
is
not
my
position.
my
position
is
that
if
she
refuses
to
answer
a
question,
while
it
is
a
refusal
of
a
direct
order
of
the
court,
that
before
the
court
can
use
its
summary
contempt
power,
that
the
record
must
show
that
the
refusal
to
answer
that
question
had
some
obstructive
effect
upon
the
judicial
process
and
it
is
not
just
enough
to
show
that
there
was
a
ipso
facto
refusal.
in
my
opinion,
the
court
cannot
punish
in
criminal
contempt
for
the
absence
--
for
the
refusal
to
answer
the
question
without
anything
else
being
shown
concerning
the
possibility
of
obstruction
and
i
think
that's
what
the
hudgins
case
shows
mr.
justice
whittaker.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
i
believe
that
unless
the
record
shows
that,
that
refusal
to
answer
was
obstructive
of
the
judicial
process
in
some
way
that
the
mere
fact
of
the
refusal
does
not
give
the
power
to
--
the
court
the
power
to
punish
for
contempt,
i
believe
that
that
what
the
law
is.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
relying
on
both
the
hudgins
case
and
the
case
of
henry
(inaudible)
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
no
he
said
that
i
find
you
guilty
of
contempt,
because
--
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
that's
correct.
but
the
court
attempted
to
use
the
contempt
power
in
that
case
to
punish
for
what
he
thought
was
perjury
and
the
holding
was
that
mere
fact
of
perjury
alone
is
not
sufficient
for
the
court
to
use
that
contempt
power,
that
there
must
be
an
obstruction,
and
we
say
that
in
this
case
there
was
no
such
obstruction.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
i
do
not
think
that
the
refusal
to
obey
all
orders
of
court
is
an
obstruction.
there
are
circumstances
under
they
you
can
refuse
to
obey
the
order
of
a
court
and
it
would
not
be
obstruction
and
that's
the
fact
in
this
case.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
mr.
justice
whittaker
i
don't
think
if
the
word
--
i'm
not
relying
upon
the
fact
that
she
was
--
she
said
it
sweetly
and
i
don't
think
that
makes
any
difference,
i
still
would
give
the
same
answer
to
mr.
justice
burton.
now
finally
on
this
--
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
other
than
the
--
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
the
michaels
cases
and
the
hudgins
cases
are
the
only
cases
that
i
know
on
the
point
of
obstruction,
and
they
both
deal
with
perjury
and
not
with
the
(inaudible)
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
i
haven't
other
cases.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
yes,
the
answer
--
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
as
the
matter
of
fact
mr.
justice
frankfurter
the
court
in
that
case
said
that
he
was
giving
answers
which
were
evasive
and
he
really
was
not
answering
the
questions
so
that
in
affect
what
was
a
refusal
to
answer
the
questions
(inaudible)
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
i
agree
with
that
wholeheartedly.
on
the
question
of
the
amount
of
the
amount
of
the
sentence
in
this
case,
at
the
time
of
oral
argument
at
last
year,
mr.
chief
justice
warren
asked
both
sides
to
submit
a
supplemental
memorandum
on
what
had
happened
in
other
contempt
cases.
those
memorandums
have
been
filed
with
the
court.
i
examined
very
carefully
the
memorandum
which
was
given
to
me
by
the
government
and
i
made
a
very
brief
reply
to
that
memorandum
and
let
me
say
this
that
from
the
refusal
to
answer
a
type
of
contempts,
the
maximum
sentence
which
has
been
given
in
any
other
contempts
case
for
refusal
to
answer
in
these
types
cases,
where
the
judgment
is
final,
has
been
either
a
30-day
sentence
or
a
60-day
sentence.
district
court
judges
have
found
that
30
days
or
at
the
most
60
days
was
sufficient
to
vindicate
the
authority
of
the
court
and
in
my
opinion
that
should
have
some
bearing
upon
what
the
court
should
do
in
another
cases.
in
no
other
case
has
the
court
given
as
drastic
a
sentence
as
the
one
year
sentence
which
was
given
in
this
case
with
the
exception
of
some
cases
which
followed
this
case
and
which
i
(inaudible)
mr.
leo
branton,
jr.
there
is
no
doubt
whatsoever.
this
court
has
that
power,
and
it
does
so
many
times
in
the
past.
