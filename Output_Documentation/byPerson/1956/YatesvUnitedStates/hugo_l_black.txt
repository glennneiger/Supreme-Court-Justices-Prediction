could
you
have
done
better
if
you
use
the
fact
that
he
had
a
certificate
when
his
appendix
was
out?
justice

he
might
--
he
might
be
insane

he

20

might
be
insane
now.
his
certificate
that
you're
saying
--
that
he
was
saying
20
years
ago
would
be
binding
now,
would
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
in
adding
dependency,
aren't
you
--
its
hard
to
suspect
that
you'd
draw
another
one.
justice
hugo

black
that
is
membership

the
acceptance
of
the
classical
books
of
the
marxist-leninist
theory.
justice
hugo

black
we
had
a
case
a
few
years
ago
from
california
as
i
recall
it
on
collateral
estoppel
and
the
taxi
case.
have
you
decided
that
case?
justice

this
was
a
criminal

this
was
a
criminal
case.

or
tax
case.
justice

that
of
a

justice

a
little
bit
more
important
than
a

permitted
neither

of
the

justice
hugo

black
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
assuming
that
the
same
charges
were
made
against
others,
were
made
in
these
indictments.
and
the
others,
you'd
have
to
define
as
privates
in
the
rear
ranks.
could
there
be
anymore
--
any
reason
why
they
couldn't
be
convicted
besides
that
these
are
what
we
call
generals
and
sub-generals?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
--
suppose
one
have
been
a
member
for
five
or
10
years
involved
in
the
communist
ticket
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
a
common
ordinary
everyday
member.
justice
hugo
l.

is
there
any
reason
why
he
wouldn't
be
convicted
under
this
kind
of
charge
the
same
as
these?
justice
hugo
l.
black
sure.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
the
case
over
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that's
a
rather
(inaudible)
but
true,
let's
suppose
that
the
evidence
imposed
in
completely
irrelevant,
couldn't
possibly
be
irrelevant,
somebody
is
put
in
jail
for
not
answering
questions.
are
you
concealing
that
under
those
circumstances
the
judge
should
have
put
him
in
jail
if
he
could?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
we
have
that
question
before
us?
can
you
cite
any
case
from
this
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
difference
is
--
is
this
the
difference
between
and
i
don't
know
if
this
is
right.
i'm
just
asking
what's
the
difference
--
are
they
saying
that
the
witness
refusal
to
answer
question
that
is
assumed
irrelevant
or
invalid
would
continue
to
deprive
the
criminal
contempt
for
that
refusal.
you
asked
them
the
next
day,
they
say,
well,
we're
going
to
give
you
another
chance
to
bring
him
back
for
review,
that
they
can
try
him
the
second
time
(inaudible).
keep
on
trying
asking
day
by
day
and
try
them
each
time
separately
for
criminal
contempt.
is
there
a
difference
between
you
and
the
government
if
you
say
they
cannot
do
that
if
they
say
you
can?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
agree
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
not?
if
you
can
ask
different
--
if
you
can
ask
the
same
witness
to
confess
here,
why
should
he
be
able
to
foreclose
you
from
trying
all
questions
by
simply
saying
i'm
not
going
to
answer
them.
what
is
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
be
a
contempt
but
would
it
also
be
a
contempt
if
you'd
ask
him
special
questions
thereafter,
he
declined
for
instance,
calling
the
logic
of
the
situation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
admit
that.
i
don't
see
why
you
argue
against
the
other.
i'm
not
sure
if
that's
correct
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
a
person
says
i'm
just
not
going
to
answer
any
question
at
all,
do
you
say
then
the
government
can't
get
him
into
other
contempts
by
asking
a
different
question,
but
here
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
is
that
precisely
the
same
ground
that
she
had
given
in
the
beginning,
the
first
theory.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
the
ground,
she
said
she
wouldn't
give
any
evidence
as
reference
to
that
group
of
kind
of
people,
at
least
that
you
asked
about
that
or
within
the
category
she
had
announced,
she
would
not
testify
against
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
your
ground
(voice
overlap)
--
and
your
argument
is
that
she
cannot
only
be
prosecuted
but
generally
declined
to
identify
those
people
as
a
whole.
she
could
pick
out
each
one
separately
and
ask
her
about
it
or
make
it
a
separate
offense.
i'm
not
sure
you
can,
but
that's
what
i
understand
your
position
to
be.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
she
--
was
she
held
in
contempt
for
refusal
to
give
names
of
some
of
the
people
who
would
--
were
within
the
category,
that
she
had
declined
to
testify
again?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
government's
position
is
they
can
do
that
to
--
make
each
one
refusal
to
answer
each
question
separately.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
could
be
asked
day
after
day.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
could
be
asked
day
after
day?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you
do
take
the
position
that
if
you
asked
about
350
people,
different
people,
her
refusal
to
answer
with
reference
to
each
one
of
them
would
constitute
separate
crimes?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
maybe
true.
(voice
overlap)
but
i'm
not
sure
--
i'm
not
sure
that
you
couldn't
be
through
certainly
logically
if
you
just
said
we
will
do
this
day
after
day,
logically.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
was
--
incidentally,
what's
the
difference
does
it
make?
what
was
the
relevance
here?
just
answer
that.
do
you
say
that
we
must
presume
that
he
just
want
to
get
information?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
helpful
in
the
trial?
how
could
that
have
helped
their
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
did
she
deny
she
was
a
communist?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
she
admit
she
had
been
a
communist
and
is
going
to
the
communist
party?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
--
what
was
the
relevance,
what
possible
bearing
--
maybe
it
could,
i
just
thought
(inaudible)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
he
a
defendant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
he
a
witness.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
question
they
asked
him
about?
that
they've
fell
in
contempt
all
that
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
one
here
involved.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
ask
about
the
first
day
too
as
well
as
the
last
day?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
she
didn't
make
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
the
evidence
--
did
the
evidence
get
in
about
what
he
had
said
if
he
was
not
a
defendant
and
not
a
witness?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
already
have
evidence
then
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
a
denial
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
sounds
to
me
like
she
say
yes,
she
is
a
communist
but
he
wasn't
a
good
one.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
--
i
don't
see
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
a
denial
over
there.
i
--
i
frankly
don't
see
in
the
inference,
or
the
relevancy
in
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
teaching
--
it's
teaching
the
advocacy.
justice
hugo
l.
black
teaching
the
advocacy
as
mean
in
the
language
of
the
--
indictment
of
the
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
are
you
reading
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
conviction,
the
validity
of
the
conviction
depend
upon
the
validity
of
these
charges
as
overt
acts,
these
particular
two?
could
you
convict
that
these
charges
are
not
valid
to
point
out
as
overt
acts
under
the
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
case
here
depends
on
the
validity
of
these
as
overt
acts.
you
say
there
is
evidence
to
prove
that
they
went
to
meetings
but
if
--
let's
suppose
that
those
were
not
sufficient
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
as
overt
acts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
nature
of
the
meeting?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
printed
in
any
of
the
appendix?
justice
hugo
l.
black
green
appendix?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
of
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
ask
you?
suppose
indictment
charged
that
a
man
gave
another
man
this
book
specifically
called
his
attention
to
that
page,
it
charged
with
his
purposes
and
candid
doing
so
was
to
get
him
to
overthrow

government
as
soon
as
possible.
would
that
be
a
good
indictment
under
the
smith
act?
would
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
he
said
that
the
intent,
just
as
you
have
in
here
with
the
jury,
as
i
understand
it
has
got
to
divide
up
between
what's
in
the
intent
in
the
minds,
and
what
was
the
right
to
convict
depends
on
that.
suppose
they
charge
him
and
gave
him
this
book,
the
intent
was
to
get
him
to
overturn
the
government
as
soon
as
possible,
as
soon
as
circumstances
would
permit.
justice
hugo
l.

why
--
why
wouldn't
that
violate
the
smith
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
what
the
indictment
said?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
where
did
it
say
that?
to
the
intent
of
causing
the
over
--
that
foresaid
overthrow
and
destruction
of
the
government,
page
2.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
said
and
if
it
does
exactly
what
it
says
here,
you're
charged
with
the
--
handed
it
--
they
head
there
and
that
they
gave
it
to
them
with
the
intent
of
advocating
to
overthrow
the
government
as
soon
as
circumstances
would
permit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
else
do
you
have
to
have?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
intending
by
that
to
urge
him
to
overthrow
the
government
as
soon
as
possible.
no.
not
intending
to
urge,
urging
him
to
commit
violent
action
with
the
intent.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean,
you
would
have
to
show
that
the
particular
individual
at
the
time
they
gave
him
the
book,
added
to
that
some
urging
that
i
want
you
to
overthrow
the
government.
if
that's
true
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
evidence
like
that
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
he
gives
him
the
book
and
says,
"this
tells
you
all
about
how
to
overthrow
the
government."
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
said,
he
picks
up
that
particular
part
that
you
read
and
gives
him
the
book.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
charged
him
what
you've
charged
here,
advocating
and
so
forth.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
in
other
words,
you
say
he
would
have
to
had,
"i
urged
you
to
do
this."
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
you
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you
have
in
this
case
against
each
one
of
these
defendants
additional
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i've
given
--
of
having
books
belong
to
the
communist
party
and
these
particular
individuals
said,
"we
want
you
to
go
out
and
overthrow

we
urged

yes.
justice

it's
okay.
thank
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
question
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
about
the
legal
sayings
of
the
schneiderman
case
but
you
haven't
covered
them
fully.
i
don't
know.
i'm
sure
you
will.
suppose
a
man
is
accused
by
the
government
of
having
received
a
$100,000
from
someone
which
he
failed
to
report
in
his
income
tax
and
the
government
tries
a
case
against
him
for
penalty
not
(inaudible)
but
for
empty
that
issue
is
tried
out
in
civil
proceedings,
the
government
loses.
suppose
later,
the
government
prosecutes
him
criminal
on
the
case
where
there's
the
same
question
that
comes
up
as
to
whether
he
received
this
$100,000
check.
is
there
any
doctrine
either
res
judicata
or
collateral
estoppel
which
would
bar
the
government
from
relitigating
that
same
question
again?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that's
the
question
in
this
matter?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
organization?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
one
are
we
talking
about
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
get
my
position
clearly.
i'll
just
ask
you
here.
as
i
understood
the
schneiderman
case,
if
i
still
understand
it,
there
were
certain
books
introduced
in
evidence.
the
government
sought
to
draw
from
those
books
the
idea
that
the
meaning
of
it
was
that
they
would
urge
people
to
commit
violence
and
overthrow
the
government.
the
lower
courts
so
held,
they
got
up
here
in
this
court
in
passing
on
those
documents,
those
books
tell
that
it
could
not
be
given
that
interpretation
because
that
it
didn't
supply
the
kind
of
proof
necessary
to
establish
that
influence.
as
i
understand
that
you've
offered
those
same
documents
here.
you
have
relied
on
precisely
the
interpretation
here
that
the
government
--
that
this
court
held
could
not
be
given
those
particular
document.
now,
that
doesn't
mean
that
you
couldn't
have
other
evidence
in
addition
to
that
of
course
which
would
make
this
case
altogether
different.
but
why
are
you
entitled
if
the
doctrine
of
collateral
estoppel
is
valid?
and
i
think
we've
held
that
it
isn't
the
case
that's
left
here.
why
are
you
entitled
again
to
relitigate
between
government
and
the
same
individual
of
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
meaning
of
that
--
of
those
books
which
this
court
has
said
did
not
establish
what
you
must
say
that
you
establish
here
either
in
whole
and
heart
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
is
the
same
individual.
i
certainly
--
it's
not
i
--
i
don't
suppose
there's
been
any
doubt
that
at
least
i
don't
think
so.
there
were
two
parties,
litigate
points.
the
court
decides
it
as
between
those
two
parties,
the
findings
of
fact
cannot
be
relitigated
in
subsequent
proceeding.
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
didn't
the
court,
unless
i'm
wrong,
maybe
--
maybe
i'm
wholly
wrong.
justice
hugo
l.
black
didn't
the
court
take
up
those
what
you
call
classics?
i'm
not
sure
i
would
so
call
it
but
didn't
the
court
take
up
what
you
call
the
classics?
and
the
government
insist
that
they
meant
one
thing
and
this
court
hold
that
they
had
failed
to
prove
that
they
meant
that
and
determines
that
issue
against
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
i'm
not
talking
about
what
it
said
it
meant.
didn't
it
decided
against
the
government
on
the
point,
on
the
interpretation
of
those
particular
books?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
--
well
suppose
it
was
tenable
but
it
wasn't
enough
to
prove
it.
it
decided
against
them
on
that
issue,
didn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
can
you
litigate
that
again
with
reference
to
those
particular
books?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
do
not
understand
that
the
defense
of
collateral
estoppel
is
dissolved,
takes
the
position
that
you
could
not
prove
to
their
fact
in
dispute
in
the
schneiderman
case
by
new
and
additional
evidence
which
has
come
out
since
but
not
with
reference
to
the
period
anterior
to
1927,
i
understand
they
say
that
and
that
you
can't
use
those
same
books
to
give
them
a
meaning
which
the
court
has
said,
they
could
not
be
given
in
that
case.
and
unless
i'm
wrong
about
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
collateral
estoppel
what
--
it
seems
to
me
that's
right
(voice
overlap)
wrong?
i
--
i
believe
that
is
a
--
a
doctrine
of
collateral
estoppel
which
has
never
been
as
follows
by
this
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
why
do
you
say
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
the
court
reaches
a
conclusion
in
certain
evidence,
does
not
mean
this
and
the
same
part
is
litigated
again,
can
either
one
of
them
raise
the
question
for
the
second
time
and
say
that
the
books
do
mean
what
the
court
said
the
government
have
failed
to
establish
the
first
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words
you
think
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
was
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
unfortunately,
i
tried
a
case
exactly
to
the
contrary.
if
you
look
up
the
case
of
moss
against
the
state
of
alabama,
you
will
find
that
a
man
shot
two
people.
they
treated
the
doctrine
of
collateral
estoppel
because
he
was
convicted
--
he
was
convicted
for
killing
one.
the
second
time
they
pleaded
that
the
fact
of
the
--
they
determine
that
he's
wholly.
it
was
not
that
of
--
of
a
murder
or
what
it
was.
the
court
of
alabama
and
in
line
with
most
of
the
authorities
of
the
united
states
held
that
they
could
not
litigate
that
same
question
twice.
but
you've
used
an
illustration
which
i
happen
to
know
is
--
is
an
old
classical
illustration
of
the
use
of
the
doctrine
of
collateral
estoppel,
not
res
adjudicata
but
collateral
estoppel.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
--
i'm
just
trying
to
get
you
to
say
why
that's
not
correct?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
wouldn't?
it
hadn't
been
litigated
just
between
the
other
parties.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
relevant
to
what
i'm
talking
about.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
didn't.
they
didn't
do
it
in
a
detached
way
it
wasn't
--
they
didn't
just
take
up
the
classics
and
write
an
essay
on
it,
did
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
you
--
i
haven't
made
my
position
clear.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
had
not
been
previously
litigated
with
dennis.
i'm
talking
about
his
doctrine
where
the
parties
are
identical
and
after
the
second
time
there's
an
effort
made
to
relitigate
the
point
in
the
court.
and
i
suppose
that
doctrine
does
apply
with
special
emphasis
to
criminal
cases.
both,
because
of
the
doctrine
in
form
of
jeopardy,
because
this
court
reviewed
the
--
as
not
being
proving
what
is
said
to
be
done
on
the
lighter
burden
of
proof
than
that
of
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
now,
for
what
i'm
asking
you
it
doesn't
apply
to
any
of
the
other
defendants.
there's
no
application
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
say
the
--
the
point
i
have
been
asking
you
about,
from
my
standpoint
would
have
no
avocation
to
any
of
the
other
defendant
except
schneiderman.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
mean
organizing
subsidiary
units?
justice
hugo
l.
black
recruitment.
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
means
that
a
minister
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
minister
has
established
church
as
an
organizer,
have
this
organization
such
as
you
referred
to
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
minister
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
of
the
church.
a
man
who
works
in
the
church
tries
to
get
new
members
of
the
church
which
is
longer
and
established?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i've
--
i've
--
fraternal
society
send
out
people,
they
have
some
who
organize
new
units.
they
are
organizers
but
you
would
say
that
even
the
man
who
are
working
in
the
fraternal
society
just
from
time
to
time
trying
to
improve
the
established
organization
or
that
they
are
organized.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
people
working
in
it.
yes.
that
--
there
is
a
member
of
it
and
they
have
prolonged.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
a
rather
unusual
meaning
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
--
do
we
have
to
hold
that
that's
the
meaning
of
it
here
in
this
case
to
sustain
the
court's
charge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
a
difference
between
you
in
that?
i
haven't
yet
quite
caught
it
under
you've
explained
it
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
about
the
other
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
get
the
error
without
injury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
charge
as
to
its
validity
does
depend
on
whether
--
whether
the
organizing
--
whether
an
organizer
is
a
man
who
goes
and
create
new
units
and
so
forth.
however,
he
just
works
or
upon
those
that
already
organized.
justice
hugo
l.
black
getting
in
new
members,
already
established
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
institutions.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
an
organization.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
would
that
be
--
couldn't
--
couldn't
they
refer
to
going
around
and
organizing
new
units
as
i
suppose
they
were
trying
to
do,
and
most
of
them
do,
organization.
i
can
--
i
can
understand
that
meaning
clearly.
certainly,
that's
organizing
and
you
go
and
create
a
new,
whatever
they
call
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no.
i
want
to
think
about,
i
was
thinking
about
going
--
organizing,
starting
a
new
unit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
different
units
and
all
that
these
are
smell
i
suppose
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
to
--
the
chamber
of
commerce
--
fraternal
society,
they
have
people
that
organize
new
or
plunge
in.
they
have
people
who
go
and
organize
new
club.
that's
organizing.
but
i
wouldn't
suppose
they're
just
being
a
member
of
those
club
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
think
of
myself,
when
i'm
alone
or
whatever
going
out
to
get
a
new
member
i
try
to
organize
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
organizing
that
one
and
if
you
organize
that
under
the
smith
act
for
the
purpose
of
advocating
the
overthrow
of
the
government.
you'd
be
guilty
of
violence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
let's
say
organize,
if
they
didn't
have
unit
in
san
diego
said
and
they
go
down
in
that
organize
one
and
organize
it
for
that
purpose.
they'll
be
guilty
of
violating
the
act
clearly
if
they
act
--
they
prove
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
they
already
had
one
in
los
angeles?
the
only
business
was,
some
of
one
to
get
some
new
members,
would
you
call
that
organizing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
according
to
your
interpretation,
i
guess,
you
could
say
--
what
you
said
that
she
first
said
she
wasn't
going
to
answer
about
any
communist
then
she
relaxed
on
the
next
--
the
second
occasion,
decided
she
would
tell
about
some
of
them.
she's
not
going
to
tell
about
any
except
those
she
wanted
to.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
say
that
second
one
is
a
second
offense
for
that
reason?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
you
say
that
if
they
keep
asking
her
about
different
ones
that
each
separate
time
she
declines
to
answer,
she
is
guilty
of
a
separate
crime,
of
a
separate
contempt?
it
is
a
crime,
isn't
it?
was
she
prosecuted
under
--
tried
under
the
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
so
it's
a
crime
under
the
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
say
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
i
get
--
it
finally
gets
down,
does
it
not,
to
a
question
of
whether
when
a
witness
says
that
they
will
not
answer
any
question
about
any
person
except
those
that
they
think
the
that
statute
condition
appears
at
each
time
the
court
asks
her
about
a
separate
person,
it's
a
separate
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
if
that's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
fact
whether
it's
a
communist
case
or
bankruptcy
case.
what
you
are
saying
there
is
this
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
declining
to
let
a
judge
sentence
a
person
with
civil
contempt
and
for
criminal
contempt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then
you're
saying
that
--
that
means
if
they
are
different,
you
get
back
to
the
question
as
to
whether
to
continue
an
offense
but
whether
there
are
two
separate
offenses,
do
you
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it's
a
continuing
offense.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
a
person
is
punished
for
cohabitation
and
later
on
there's
an
attempt
to
punish
him
for
adultery,
doing
at
the
same
period
with
the
same
person.
would
you
be
convicted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
this
court
has
known
and
could
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
be
tried
for
adultery?
justice
hugo
l.
black
during
at
the
time
or
does
that
bother
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
are
different
but
the
person
goes
to
the
same
jail
in
either
event,
doesn't
it,
for
the
same
thing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
the
same
definition.
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
her
getting
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
testify?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
but
the
--
the
reason
he
did
that
was
because
she
failed
to
testify.
and
that's
basically
why
she
went
to
jail,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
second
time
that
she
goes
is
because
she
failed
to
testify,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
jail
--
the
jail
probably
the
same
one,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
that's
correct
then
of
course
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
the
other
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
held
that
she
couldn't
be
tried
for
both?
justice
hugo
l.
black
held
they
couldn't
be
tried
for
both,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
other
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
call
that
a
retrospective?
you
--
you
accepted
that
statement,
why
do
you
call
it
retrospective
when
a
person
does
something
one
day
and
they
decide
four
days
later
they
will
prosecute
him,
has
done
all
the
time,
isn't
it,
unless
it's
barred
with
the
statute
of
limitation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
that
had
done
in
assault
and
battery,
taking
it
down
to
separate
crimes,
separate
offenses.
that
had
been
assault
and
battery
and
he'd
fined
her
in
civil
contempt
on
monday.
couldn't
they
have
tried
her
for
the
assault
and
battery
thereafter?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
your
point
that
you
raised,
that
in
order
for
this
to
be
punished
as
contempt,
it
is
not
enough
to
show
that
the
defendant
refuses
to
answer,
but
you
must
in
addition
to
that
as
in
connection
with
perjury,
show
that
the
refusal
to
answer,
actually
served
as
an
obstruction
to
the
proceedings
of
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
case
many
years
ago
from
california
where
the
man,
i've
forgotten
his
name,
that
judge
beal,
that
after
judge
beal,
they
tried
him
for
contempt,
have
you
looked
at
it,
do
you
remember
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
cited
in
oliver,
against
the
oliver
case,
333
u.s.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
difference
did
that
make?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
difference
did
that
make
in
the
charge
you
had
against
her,
whether
she
knew
some
people
as
communists?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
would
that
tend
to
show
that
she
advocated
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
communist?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
shown
by
other
evidence
that
they
were
communists?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
dispute
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
had
anybody
denied
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
the
public
teachings
--
were
they
–
were
they
secret
teachers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
may
i
say
before
you
leave
the
point
of
hudgins,
that
as
i
read
hudgins
and
the
other
cases
on
which
it
rests,
it
makes
a,
makes
the
obstruction
of
the
court,
the
constitutional
prerequisite
to
what
is
known
as
contempt,
a
contempt
by
a
person
can
be
given
a
summary
trail
without
protection
of
bill
of
rights,
what
do
you
say
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
objection
to
trial
here
without
a
jury
on
the
ground
that
this
statute
creates
a
crime
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
distinct
from
the
common
law
idea
of
contempt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
not
in
this
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
she
is
neither
(inaudible)
be
affirmed
now
and
sent
back,
when
would
her
sentence
begin?
justice
hugo
l.
black
pretty
soon.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
see
---
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
it
apply
to
anything
else
except
contempt
cases?
the
basis
of
the
hudgins
opinion
was
that's
a
very
narrow
exception
to
the
bill
of
rights
protections
to
try
a
defendant
there
has
to
be
very
narrow
and
one
of
the
things
that
makes
it
constitutionally
possible
to
try
and
the
thing
which
he
said
is
an
essential
ingredient
to
make
it
so
is
to
prevent
giving
a
close
shot,
is
that
there
must
be
an
actual
obstruction
to
the
court
in
addition
as
it
was
held
there,
the
prejudice
there
that
he
said
was
relied
on
the
principle
that
there
must
always
been
shown
or
you
could
escape
giving
a
man
a
full
trial
under
the
bill
of
rights,
the
central
ingredient
was
that
of
obstruction.
so
why
would
it
go
any
further
in
contempt
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
thought
you
were
saying,
pointing
out
to
the
consequences
of
holding
that
in
contempt
cases
for
a
man
to
be
tried
summarily
without
the
benefit
of
a
jury,
an
indictment
and
so
forth
that
if
we
held
that
in
contempt
cases
justified
trial
there
must
be
an
obstruction,
the
same
thing
would
be
true
with
reference
to
other
types
of
refusals
to
answer
question.
i
don't
see
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
would
they
be
tried?
a
person
who
tries
to
escape
the
draft,
who
won't
answer
the
question
