and
you
--
you're
arguing
that
the
government
has
undertaken
which
say
that
mere
membership
is
sufficient
to
justify
the
conviction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
could
have
a
knowing
membership
or
an
understanding
membership.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
--
is
there
someone
--
someone
of
these
defendants
who
went
to
that
study
class?
and
if
they
say
these
are
the
books
that
you
should
read
or
what
--
or
did
they
say
anything?
how
do
these
books
get
in
the
hands
of
other
people
than
this

william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--

petitioners
as

of
those
various
committees,
took
part
in
that
action?

brennan,
jr.
was
there
an
open
study
class,
where
20
people
went
and
someone
talked
to
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
in
the
record
here?
as
to
what
they
talked
about
at
that
study
class
or
the
right
to
these
books?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we'll
talk
about
that
later.
it's
a
question
of
tying
up
these
books
with
these
petitioners.

talking
about
a
subsequent?

of
