mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
thank
you,
sir.
if
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
go
back
for
just
a
few
minutes
to
a
question
which
arose
yesterday
concerning
a
--
a
comparison
between
the
costello
case
and
--
and
this
case.
to
recall
once
again
in
the
costello
case
a
witness
just
simply
flatly
refuse
to
answer
any
questions,
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
situation
was
but
one
contempt.
in
this
situation,
the
witness
on
the
first
day
of
her
cross-examination
was
interrogated
concerning
certain
members
of
the
communist
party
and
she
took
the
position
that
she
would
not
testify
as
to
her
co-defendants
who
had
rested
and
as
to
other
members
of
the
communist
party
because
she
did
not
want
to
become
a
government
informer.
now,
three
days
later
and
--
and
at
that
time,
of
course,
the
court
incarcerated
the
witness,
the
petitioner
here,
until
such
time
that
she
would
agree
to
answer
the
questions.
now,
three
days
later
while
still
on
cross-examination,
the
witness,
when
she
was
interrogated
concerning
certain
other
members
of
the
communist
party,
reiterated
her
previous
position
and
added
that,
"i
am
willing
to
give
names
of
people
whom
i
know
i
cannot
hurt,
but
where
it
is
a
question
of
damaging
their
interest,
of
harming
their
ability
to
make
a
livelihood,
of
hurting
their
families,
no."
she
then
refused
after
making
that
statement
to
answer
the
11
questions
which
are
the
specifications
of
the
contempt
involved
in
this
case.
now,
what
she
did
then
on
the
second
occasion
was
to
say
to
the
court
that
i
have
previously
refused
to
answer
four
questions.
now,
i
have
asked
additional
questions
concerning
members
of
the
communist
party
and
i
will
have
to
determine
on
a
question
by
question
basis,
which
questions
i
will
answer,
which
questions
i
will
refuse
to
answer.
now,
in
the
costello
case,
we
submit,
the
witness
having
stated
i
won't
answer
anything.
the
--
the
nature
of
the
contempt,
the
extent
of
the
defiance
was
apparent,
it
was
complete.
and
a
sentencing
judge
would
have
the
--
the
full
benefit
of
the
seriousness
of
the
contempt
of
the
particular
witness.
in
this
case,
on
the
first
day,
when
the
witness
refused
to
answer
four
specific
questions
while
asserting
at
the
same
time
that
she
would
still
continue
to
answer
other
questions.
the
district
court
did
not
know
the
extent
of
the
witness'
defiance
of
his
lawful
orders.
it
became
much
more
apparent
four
--
three
days
later
when
she
made
it
more
crystal
clear
that
she
herself
would
have
to
determine.
she
would
not
accept
the
judge's
decision
as
to
whether
a
particular
question
would
be
answered.
she
herself
would
decide
on
the
basis
of
her
own
subjective
test,
what
questions
would
be
answered
and
what
questions
would
not
be
answered.
so
i
submit
that
if
a
court
having
been
defied
on
four
occasions
on
one
day
and
having
incarcerated
the
witness
until
such
time
as
she
would
purge
was
thereby
divested
of
any
authority
three
days
later
to
further
--
to
take
further
steps
in
connection
with
this
contempt,
this
repeated
defiant
attitude
of
the
witness
that
the
--
the
trial
courts
would
find
themselves
in
interminable
position,
a
position
which
would
cause
a
criminal
trial
to
degenerate
into
a
witness
conducting
or
master
--
mastering
the
conduct
of
the
trial
rather
than
the
court.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
and
controlling
the
conduct.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
know,
sir.
i
--
i
think
that
regardless
of
her
statements
here
that
the
contempts
on
the
separate
days
were
separate
contempts.
and
that
the
district
court
could
well
have
thought
and
reasonably
have
thought
that
by
putting
her
in
jail
overnight
or
for
a
couple
of
days,
she
would
come
to
her
senses
and
would
respond
to
the
court's
directives.
and
that
three
days
later
when
she
again
refused
another
further
--
a
lawful
order
of
the
court
that
she
committed
a
separate
contempt.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir.
i
--
i
think
in
any
event,
there
would
be
separate
contempts.
but
that
even
--
even
if
a
test
is
given
as
to
--
to
whether
she
made
a
flat
statement
and
stopped
to
refusing
to
answer
that
type
of
question.
she
didn't
do
that
here
because
she
specifically
stated
here,
“i
am
going
to
decide
on
a
question
by
question
basis.”
the
prosecutor
couldn't
know
when
he
asked
a
question
if
she
was
going
to
answer
the
question
or
not.
the
judge
couldn't
know
if
this
was
going
to
be
a
question
that
she
would
refuse
or
would
not
refuse
to
answer.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
she
did.
yes,
sir.
between
--
between
the
four
contempts
on
june
26th
and
the
11
refusals
on
june
30th,
she
testified
as
to
a
mike
quinn,
whom
she
identified
to
be
a
member
of
the
communist
party
or
is
having
been
a
member
of
the
party.
and
she
also
testified
as
to
a
sam
darson
(ph),
as
a
person
whom
she
knew
to
be
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
and
also
she
testified
as
to
william
z.
foster,
who
was
the
national
chairman,
still
is
a
national
chairman
of
the
communist
party.
and
who
incidentally,
at
the
time
of
her
testimony,
was
under
indictment
in
another
smith
act
prosecution
and
who
had
not
has
yet
been
tried,
still
hasn't
been
tried.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that
--
that
apparently
is
what
happened,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
because
she
relaxed?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir.
i
say
it's
a
separate
contempt
in
any
event.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
she
was
tried
under
the
provisions
of
rule
42
(a),
the
criminal
contempt
procedural
statute
and
18
u.s.c.
401.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
each
one.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right.
i
think
that
was
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir.
because
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
say,
i
don't
believe
that
a
person
could
not
be
proceeded
against
both
for
civil
contempt
and
criminal
contempt
for
the
same
contemptuous
conduct.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
as
i
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
then
they
can
--
then
she
can
be
punished
even
if
it's
a
continuing
single
offense.
she
can
be
punished
both
for
the
criminal
contempt
and
she
can
be
proceeded
against
for
the
civil
contempt.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
sir,
the
--
the
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
crimes
--
the
crimes
are
not
identical
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
could
not.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right.
this
court
has
held
that
a
cohabitation
offense
cannot
be
broken
down
into
periods
of
time.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
in
other
words,
if
there's
a
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
as
i
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
oh,
that
bothers
me
a
little
bit.
i
--
i
wouldn't
be
sure,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
two
offenses
would
have
different
ingredients,
different
elements
and
if
--
if
that
were
so
they
could
be
prosecuted
as
separate
crimes.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right.
and
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
it
could
and
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
not
for
the
same
thing.
no.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
was
not
the
same
purpose.
that's
what
distinguishes
civil
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
it's
not
the
same
purpose
of
the
confinement.
what
the
judge
did
here
--
did
on
june
26
was
to
put
her
in
jail
in
an
--
under
the
equitable
power
of
the
court
in
an
effort
to
coerce
her
to
answer.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
so
that
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
to
--
that's
right.
well,
to
coerce
her
to
give
the
answers.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
but
the
purpose
of
the
confinement
is
different.
in
one
--
in
one
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
if
the
court
please,
i
think
this
court
has
held
in
a
number
of
cases
that
the
same
act
can
constitute
both
civil
and
criminal
contempt.
and
that
it
is
a
purpose
of
the
incarceration,
if
that's
what
it
is,
that
determines
whether
the
particular
incarceration
is
for
a
civil
or
--
or
a
criminal
contempt.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir.
the
court
of
appeals
treated
this
as
two
separate
and
distinct
contempt.
the
first
one
as
a
civil
contempt
and
the
--
and
the
11
refusals
on
june
30
as
a
criminal
contempt
and
i
think
it's
clear
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
sir?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
it
--
it
--
it
merely
held
in
the
other
case
as
to
the
four
refusals
for
which
she
was
put
in
jail
during
the
trial.
that
because
the
trial
judge
had
not
told
her
at
the
time
he
--
he
put
her
in
jail
to
coerce
her
answers,
because
he
had
not
told
her
that
she
still
faced
a
proceeding
in
criminal
contempt,
that
she
still
could
be
punished,
that
the
--
the
procedure
lacks
the
necessary
due
process.
and
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right.
that's
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
and
i
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
and
i
think
that
was
the
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
and
i
think
that
was
the
rationale
of
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
the
first
four.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
except
that
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
instance
held
that
the
witness
who
was
going
to
jail
for
her
four
refusals
on
june
26
could
well
have
considered
that
that
would
be
her
total
punishment.
and
that
the
court
later
on,
not
having
forewarned
her
during
her
stay
in
jail,
could
not
then
go
back
and
say,
we're
also
going
to
proceed
against
you
for
criminal
contempt
on
the
--
on
the
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir.
that
isn't
our
contention.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir.
here,
the
witness
on
one
day
said,
i
won't
answer
questions
as
to
the
members
of
the
communist
party
and
i
won't
answer
questions
as
to
my
co-defendants
who
have
rested.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
then
in
the
course
of
her
subsequent
testimony
and
before
she
was
asked
these
11
questions
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
she
did,
in
fact,
testified
concerning
members
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
said,
i
think,
if
the
court
please,
that
whether
she
had
continued
to
assert
the
same
reading
--
reason
that
--
in
other
words,
the
reason
she
asserted
on
the
first
day,
if
she
had
reasserted
it
on
the
third
day
that
it
would
have
been
two
contempts
but
because
of
the
factual
situation
we
have
here
where
the
--
the
two
contempts
were
connected
by
her
having
testified
about
members
of
the
communist
party.
so
as
a
--
as
a
practical
matter
she
--
she
did
testify
about
the
members
of
the
communist
party.
and
i
think
the
prosecutor
had
the
right
to
assume
that
she
would
answer,
having
--
having
answered
three
questions
three
days
later
or
two
days
later,
that
she
would
continue
to
answer
as
to
some
people.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
that,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
certainly
think
it
would
be
a
better
situation
if
at
the
time
of
her
refusal
the
court
said,
"i'm
going
to
put
you
in
jail
until
such
time
as
you
purge
civil
content."
if
he
had
then
said
at
the
same
time
and
in
addition,
"i'm
going
to
hold
you
in
criminal
contempt
and
i
will
sentence
you
at
--
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial."
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that
would
avoid
any
question
that
is
--
such
as
is
raised
by
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
the
--
the
companion
case
here.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir.
i
--
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
he
could.
but
i
just
wanted
to
--
to
emphasize
the
practical
problem
which
--
which
--
with
--
with
which
the
trial
judge
found
himself
confronted
here.
a
witness
who
--
who
refused
to
answer
four
questions
and
whom
he
thought
he
could
probably
bring
around
by
a
night
or
two
in
jail.
and
then
three
days
later
her
continued
defiance
of
the
court's
authority,
and
i
think
that
it's
clear
that
the
court
should
have
been
and
he
was
empowered
to
further
deal
with
those
later
defiances.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir.
i
think
that
if
his
primary
purpose
is
to
--
is
to
coerce,
then
a
sentence
under
the
criminal
contempt
statute
would
not
be
proper.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
but
because
by
that
time
it's
apparent
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
the
substance
of
that
i
think
i
probably
did,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
but
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
but
the
--
the
thinking
behind
that
statement
is
that
several
days
later
it
is
apparent
that
this
witness
is
just
adamant
in
her
defiance
of
the
court's
authority.
and
i
think
that
by
that
time
it
is
--
it
is
particularly
apparent
to
everyone
in
the
courtroom
that
this
witness
is
just
standing
there
defying
the
courts
authority,
and
that
the
court
at
that
point
has
a
right
to
vindicate
the
authority
of
the
court.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
to
vindicate
the
authority
of
the
court,
i
think
he
can.
yes,
sir.
now,
that
--
i
think
only
have
two
or
three
minutes
left
and
i
would
just
like
to
discuss
the
petitioner's
contention
of
the
court's
purpose
here
in
giving
here
the
one
year
sentence
was
to
coerce
rather
than
to
punish,
rather
than
to
vindicate
the
authority
of
the
court.
and
in
--
in
an
attempt
to
bolster
their
argument,
they
have
isolated
colloquy
between
court
and
counsel
in
not
only
this
proceeding
but
in
the
other
contempt
proceedings.
however,
the
order
of
judgement
in
the
certificate
here
of
criminal
contempt
is
specifically
clear.
it's
precise
that
the
court
was
proceeding
in
this
case
under
rule
42
(a),
the
criminal
contempt
statute,
that
he
found
her
guilty
of
criminal
contempt
and
that
the
imposition
of
the
one
year
sentence
was
for
her
criminal
contempt
and
not
to
coerce
her
answers.
and
the
colloquy
that
is
cited
by
the
petitioners,
insofar
as
it
relates
to
this
case,
only
reflects
the
--
the
grace
of
the
court
in
offering
to
accept
a
layer
answering
of
the
questions
as
a
bowing
by
the
petitioner
to
the
authority
of
the
court
and
to
accept
that
as
vindication
of
the
court's
authority.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i'd
be
very
happy
to
try
to
do
that,
your
honor.
