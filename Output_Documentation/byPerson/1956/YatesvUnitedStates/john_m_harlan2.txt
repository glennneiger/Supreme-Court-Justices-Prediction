justice
john
m.
harlan
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question.
do
you
dispute
that
on
the
issue
of
whether
the
purposes
of
the
communist
party
of
california
were
within
the
purview
of
the
smith
act?
do
you
dispute
there
was
enough
evidence
to
go
to
the
--
to
raise
a
jury
question
on
that
fragment
of
the
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
do.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
assume
this
case
that
there
may
have
been
or
there
was
a
policy
of
the
communist
party
of
united
states?
they
would
use
force
to
bring
about
their
--
i
know
you
said
there's
no
evidence
of
that
in
here,
what
about
teachings
of
the
party
itself.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
that
there
is
either
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
is
no
complicity
--
on
part
of
these
defendants
and
no
statement
--
of
no
evidence
as
to
the
party
itself
as
to
whether
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
kenny,
i
maybe
mistaken,
but
i
thought
that
schneiderman
--
in
schneiderman,
the
court
expressly
disclaimed
any
need
for
determining
what
the
communist
party
represented.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
that
all
they
decided
in
that
case
was
that
the
government
had
not
met
its
burden
of
proof
in
showing
that
schneiderman
had
advocated
what
the
government
had
said.
justice
john
m.
harlan
therefore,
how
does
any
adjudication
as
to
the
--
either
schneiderman
state
of
mind
or
as
to
the
nature
of
the
communist
party
operate
here
as
a
collateral
estoppel.
justice
john
m.
harlan
were
all
the
people
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
supposed
you
can
put
your
position
something
like
this,
can't
you
that
this
was
not
a
case
where
the
prosecutor
was
trying
to
accumulate
contempts
by
just
asking
the
same
question
under
the
guise
of
different
names
of
people
that
under
her
formula,
to
know
him
as
the
prosecutor
you'd
tell
in
advance
whether
or
not
the
answer
to
a
particular
name
would
fall
within
her
own
self
defined
(inaudible)
or
not.
and
he
had
no
course
except
to
go
through
the
list
and
find
out
by
asking
the
questions,
isn't
that
your
position?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
do
you
tie
this
overt
act
into
those
being
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy?
justice
john
m.
harlan
excuse
me,
i'm
using
your
106
too.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
number
is
that?
934
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
anything
in
this
charge
on
this
aspect
that
is
omitted
and
what
was
in
the
medina
charge
in
the
dennis
case
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
which
this
court
had
before
ruled?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
the
difference?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
brought
home
to
anybody
besides
schneiderman?
justice
john
m.
harlan
to
any
defendant
besides
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
schneiderman?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
raise
a
question
to
you?
i
take
it
that
at
least
so
far
as
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
is
concerned
there
is
no
shortcut
except
to
go
through
this
record
with
regard
to
each
defendant,
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
realize
you've
done
a
lot
of
help
but
still
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
with
all
the
help
in
that,
there
is
no
shortcut
to
evaluating
this
evidence
without
matching
it
against
the
position
of
each
defendant.
that's
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
is
no
way
in
which
you
can
take
a
broad
brush
to
this
problem,
is
there?
justice
john
m.
harlan
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
therefore
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
appreciate
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
appreciate
that.
all
i
was
about
to
suggest
to
that
is,
since
that
is
inevitable
part
of
this
job
that
we've
got
to
do.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
it
might
be
more
profitable
if
you
directed
yourself
to
the
legal
points
of
issue
that
are
involved
here
would
surrender
themselves
better
to
our
argument
than
this
kind
of
thing.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
simply
speaking
for
myself.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
which
they
were
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
was
hoping
your
going
to
suggest
that
there
was.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
this
question?
take
the
document
of
collateral
estoppel
as
barring
from
using
this
evidence.
have
you
got
enough
to
hold
this
case
against
schneiderman
without
resorting
to
that
pre-1927
evidence?
do
you
have
to
rely
on
the
pre
1927
evidence?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
--
you
think
you
can
forget
about
collateral
estoppel
and
start
from
1927
and
still
hold
the
verdict
against
him?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
do?
justice
john
m.
harlan
judge
dimock
took
a
different
view
of
it
in
the
flynn
case,
didn't
he?
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
the
lower
courts
have
taken
a
different
view
except
this
one,
haven't
they?
justice
john
m.
harlan
check
the
cases
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
and
that's
all
of
it
and
i
didn't
find
any
difference,
any
exception.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
you're
not
answering
the
question.
justice
john
m.
harlan
whether
the
only
defendant
have
been
in
the
communist
party
himself?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
will
you
concede,
there
was
enough
evidence
to
raise
the
jury
questions,
but
for
the
purpose
(inaudible)
force
and
violence.
justice
john
m.
harlan
assuming
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
assuming
that
she
had
made
no
supplementary
statement
on
the
30th,
do
you
think
then
that
the
questions
asked
on
the
30th
in
view
of
her
statement
on
the
26th
as
to
her
general
attitude
would
have
constituted
but
one
contempt?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
you
attach
no
weight
to
her
supplementary
statement
on
the
30th?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
suppose
under
the
united
mine
workers
doctrine
at
the
time
that
she
after
refused
to
answer
the
first
question
--
first
question.
there
would
have
been
nothing
to
prevent
the
court
from
saying,
"i'm
going
to
give
you
civil
contempt
sentence
and
commit
you
until
you
purge
yourself,
at
the
same
time
i'm
going
to
give
you
a
criminal
sentence,"
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
your
position
is
that
if
you
only
had
one
question
asked
in
this
case
and
the
third
day
after
she'd
been
in
jail,
the
court
brought
her
back
and
say,
"are
you
willing
to
answer
this
question?"
she
said,
"no."
he
then
could've
added
to
the
criminal
--
to
the
civil
contempt
sentence,
a
criminal
contempt
sentence
on
top
of
it,
right?
that's
your
basic
position,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
but
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
as
i
understand
it,
he
didn't
impose
the
criminal
contempt
sentence
in
respect
of
which
--
of
the
june
26
questions
until
after
the
civil
contempt
sentence
had
expired
by
virtue
of
the
end
of
trial.
and
therefore,
he
was
trying
to
add
nunc
pro
tunc,
a
criminal
contempt
sentence.
justice
john
m.
harlan
which
is
quite
a
different
proposition
from
the
case
i
put
to
you
of
a
continuing
contempt,
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
that
if
he
could
do
it
in
the
case
of
a
single
question,
initially
at
the
same
time,
why
can't
he
do
it
later
on
at
the
same
contempt
discontinuing?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
was
the
time
interval
between
the
first
episode
and
the
one
you
are
talking
about?
justice
john
m.
harlan
three
days.
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
one
were
to
agree
with
your
position
that
this
is
a
single
contempt,
what
about
â€“
what
do
you
say
to
the
right
of
the
court
to
see
it
as
one
continuing
contempt
and
to
impose
sentence
on
the
basis
of
what
happened
on
the
30th,
which
is
a
continuing
contempt?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes
certainly.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
do
you
do
with
subdivision
three
of
401?
justice
john
m.
harlan
subdivision
one
talks
about
obstruction,
subdivision
three
talks
about
resistance
to
a
lawful
order,
command,
et
cetera
of
the
court.
justice
john
m.
harlan
have
you
got
any
case
which
suggests
that
where
the
ground
of
the
contempt
is
refusal
to
obey
a
command
of
the
court,
that
obstruction
is
a
necessary
element?
justice
john
m.
harlan
other
than
the
refusal?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
you
haven't
found
any
such
case
have
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
retain
any
doubt
as
to
the
power
of
this
court
if
it
thinks
the
sentence
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
deal
with
a
sentence
directly?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john

the
fact
that
she
had
served
the
sentence.
