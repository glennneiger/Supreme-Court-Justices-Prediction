chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
monahan,
would
you
mind
referring
to
what
mr.
margolis
said
about,
i
believe
you
said
four
of
them
were
--
had
held
national
office,
few
of
them
had
held
state
office
and
a
few
of
them
had
held
county
office,
and
a
few
of
them
had
held
no
office.
would
you
mind
relating
those
--
in
according
to
those
classifications
with
the
dennis
group
as
long
as
you
start
along
those
lines.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
so
because
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
like
to
get
all
of
them
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
because
you
said
some
of
them
were
four
star
generals,
lieutenant
generals
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
some
brigadiers.
and
i
just
like
to
know
who
the
brigadiers
were
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
who
the
lieutenant
generals?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
just
--
i
just
want
to
know
what
their
importance
is.
chief

that's
all
in

chief

mr.

chief

warren
mr.
wirin,
before
you
get
to
that,
let
me
ask
you,
do
you
--
do
you
believe
she
was
justified
in
not
answering
these
questions,
the
four,
or
do
you
--
do
you
--
are
you
arguing
only
that
the
--
that
the
punishment
was
excessive?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
they
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
monahan.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
mr.
monahan,
assume
--
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
there
is
in
this
case
but
one
contempt
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
court
have
the
right
to
coerce
a
witness
by
sending
her
to
jail
on
the
day
that
she
commits
the
contempt?
then
after
the
trial
is
over
without
any
announcement
therefore
that
he's
to
consider
it
as
criminal
contempt,
give
her
a
period
of
years
as
a
sentence
for
criminal
contempt?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
meant
--
i'm
just
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
--
no.
i'm
not
asking
what
they
did.
i'm
asking
what
your
position
here
is.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
me
just
--
let
me
just
carry
it
on
one
step
farther.
as
i
understand
it,
you
said
that
--
that
even
though
there
was
only
one
contempt
in
this
case,
you
--
it
is
your
position
that
she
can
be
sentenced
on
these
11
counts
after
the
trial,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
now,
let
me
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
if
she
committed
that
one
contempt,
she
committed
it
on
the
first
day,
did
she
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
--
no
(voice
overlap).
you
conceded.
you
said
that's
an
ultimate
position
of
yours
and
you
said
that
even
though
there
was
one
contempt,
he
could
still
sentence
her
at
the
conclusion
of
trial
for
criminal
contempt,
didn't
you?
all
right,
now,
let's
assume
that
in
this
case,
there
is
but
one
contempt,
just
for
the
sake
of
art.
if
that
is
true,
the
contempt
was
committed
on
the
first
day
she
refused
to
answer
the
question,
was
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
you
said,
you
agreed
with
the
--
with
the
court
of
appeals
a
little
while
ago,
that
--
that
she
had
to
be
advised
at
the
time
that
she
was
put
in
contempt,
that
she
would
also
be
prosecuted
for
criminal
contempt.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
court
do
that
in
this
instance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know.
(voice
overlap)
i
know
but
we're
being
here
as
one
contempt
because
you
said
you
would
--
you
would
assume
that
for
the
sake
of
your
argument
and
still
contend
that
they
could
send
her
to
jail
for
terminal
years
after
the
trial
was
over
for
criminal
contempt.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
if
a
contempt
wasn't
complete
on
the
first
day,
what
was
she
in
jail
for
after
the
first
day?
he
sent
her
to
jail
right
away,
he
said
you
committed
a
contempt
against
this
court.
in
refusing
to
answer
his
questions,
i
send
you
to
jail.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
she
must
have
been
in
jail
because
the
contempt
was
completed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
we're
proceeding
at
this
time
on
the
assumption
that
there
is
but
one
contempt
because
you
said
you
would
--
you
would
pursue
that
argument,
that
even
though
there
was
one
contempt,
the
court
could
afterwards
sentence
her
to
--
to
term
of
years
for
criminal
contempt.
provided,
he
had
notified
her
at
the
time
she
committed
the
offense
that
he
intended
to
hold
her
both
criminally
and
civilly.
did
he
do
that
on
the
first
day?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
he
sent
her
to
jail.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
there
must
have
been
the
completed
contempt
there.
must
there
is
she
was
entitled
--
if
she
was
to
go
to
jail
and
--
and
he
wouldn't
consent
to
bail?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
if
there
was
one
contempt
then
he
couldn't
sentence
her
at
the
trial
for
criminal
contempt?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you're
going
away
from
your
own
admission
now
it
seems
to
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
will
take
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
in
the
record
here
as
we
have
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
copied
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
she
took
that
--
she
took
that
position
generally
in
that
first
question
that
you
just
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
read
was
that
she
because
--
she
said,
"i'm
not
willing
to
provide
names
and
i
intend
that
these
people
other
than
those
that
i
have
indicated
because
i
believe
in
the
case
of
the
other
defendants,
their
case
was
already
rested,
i
would
only
be
contributing
toward
the
(inaudible)
adding
to
the
prosecution
case
against
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
she
took
that
general
position
at
the
outset,
did
she
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
rest
of
it
in
particular
(inaudible),
was
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
any
of
these
--
do
any
of
these
11
questions
refer
specifically
to
other
defendants?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
--
the
thing
i
would
like
to
ask
you
is
if
that
was
at
all
included
in
the
first
question
that
you
read
a
little
while
ago.
she
was
then
asked,
who
else
of
the
defendants
she
had
met
with
to
these
headquarters
in
connection
with
her
party
duties.
she
refused
to
answer
these
questions
stating
that
she
was
“not
willing
to
provide
names
and
identities
of
people
other
than
those
that
i
have
indicated,
because
i
believe
and
so
forth.”
so
she
covered
all
of
those
people
on
that
first
day,
and
that
first
question
or
that
first
answer
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
now,
let's
see,
or
as
she
did
say
that
because
i
believe
that
the
other
defendants
have
rested.
but
she
goes
on
to
say
i'm
not
willing
to
do
anything
that
is
going
to
harm
the
defense
of
other
people
and
open
up
the
door
for
persecution
and
harassment
of
other
people.
that's
a
broad
statement.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i'll
tell
you
why
i
asked
that
mr.
monahan,
it's
hard
for
me
to
follow
the
argument
that
if
a
witness
comes
in
to
court
and
says,
“i
refused
to
answer
any
questions
of
any
kind
that
are
asked
to
me”,
that
he
can
only
be
punished
for
one
contempt,
but
that
if
a
person
comes
into
court
and
says
i
will
answer
any
question
about
my
self,
that
you
may
ask
me,
anything
that
is
pertinent
to
this
case,
but
i
will
not
be
an
informer
against
others,
that
you
can
then
go
ahead
and
give
that
person
intimately
more
punishment
than
you
would
give
the
thoroughly
re-counsel
witness
by
breaking
it
up
then
asking
him
on
successive
days,
and
about
successive
persons,
a
very
same
thing
that
the
witness
do
or
refused
to
testify
about
in
the
first
instance.
that,
it
seems
to
me
is
--
it
is
not
a
very
--
or
just
approach
to
a
situation
to
say
the
least.
now
of
course,
if
you
have
definite
authority
to
the
effect
that
that
could
be
done
whether
that
give
way
to
it,
but
it
does
seems
to
me
that
those
two
things
don't
square.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
think
that's
sufficient
to
distinguish
her
from
costello
so
that
the
judge
might
have
the
right
to
sentence
her
on
any
number
of
counts
that
he
desires
and
up
to
three
years
on
a
count
where
on
the
other
hand,
mr.
costello
would
only
be
punished
ones,
do
you
think
that's
just?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
are
trying
to
take
them
out
of
it
and
although
conceding,
that
it's
all
right
for
costello.
now,
where
is
the
justice
in
your
position
from
trying
to
inflict
this
punishment
on
her
when
it
could
not
be
done
in
the
costello
case?
do
you
think
she
has
committed
a
greater
crime
against
--
against
the
government
than
costello
did?do
you
think
she's
permitted
to
greater
indignity
to
the
court
than
costello
did?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
do
you
think
that
costello
was
only
--
should
only
be
subject
to
one
punishment
that
--
will
this
woman
should
be
subject
to
many,
as
a
matter
of
justice?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
might
--
it
might
be
subject
to
greater
punishment
if
you
think
so
for
having
done
it
but
is
--
do
you
make
a
distinction
between
multiple
offenses
in
a
single
offense?
do
you
think
she
has
committed
multiple
offenses
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
more
than
costello?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
he
alleged
to
be
one
of
the
conspirators?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
--
i
thought
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
the
prosecutor
announced
that
he
was
not
going
to
ask
her
any
questions
except
about
defendants
and
those
who
were
named
as
co-conspirators
in
the
indictment.
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
you
--
did
you
say
that
to
me?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
did.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
said
that.
chief
justice

we'll

mr.

you
may
proceed.
chief

where
do
we
find
these
in

record?
chief

that
i
thought
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
--
where
do
you
find
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
monahan,
as
i
understand
this
testimony
of
schneiderman
was
limited
to
him,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
was
brought
--
that
was
brought
in
first
by
putting
in
his
cross-examination
and
his
denaturalization
proceeding,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
into
the
case
--
into
this
case
by
the
introduction
of
his
testimony
in
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
his
denaturalization
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
did
you
bring
it
in?
what's
the
sequence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
now,
how
--
how
did
you
start
your
proof
on
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
about
william
schneiderman.
and
then
how
--
how
did
this
testimony
in
the
denaturalization
case
come
in?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
ask
that.
i
just
asked
you
how
it
came
in.
chief
justice
earl
warren
she
put
it
in?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
he
aid
informer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
had
been
--
he
had
been
in
the
party,
in
the
pay
of
the
government?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
--
wasn't
that
gone
into
the
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
committee
was
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
judge
wouldn't
permit
it
to
be
asked
in
that
form?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
margolis
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
margolis,
did
i
--
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
so
far
as
the
briefs
were
concerned,
there's
no
great
difference
of
opinion
between
you
on
the
facts
of
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
donovan.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
donovan,
i'm
afraid
--
i'm
afraid
your
time
is
up.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
now
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
me
suggest
this.
you
--
you
are
now
--
you
and
mr.
monahan
were
agreed
as
to
the
--
as
to
some
phases
at
least
of
your
evidence.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
mind
putting
that
in
writing
so
it
will
help
simplify
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
without
putting
any
obligation
on
other
counsel,
i
might
say
that
if
there
are
any
phases
that
you
can
agree
with
mr.
monahan
on
that
will
simplify
the
issue
for
us.
you
may
feel
free
to
do
the
same
thing
but
no
obligation
on
anybody
to
--
to
do
it.
chief

mr.
maroney,
you
--
i
think
you
had
not
concluded,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
monahan,
assuming
that
--
that
the
petitioner
stated
her
reasons
fully
and
clearly
that
she
did
not
propose
to
answer
any
questions
concerning
others
because
she
didn't
want
to
be
an
informer.
and
then
the
government
took
the
roster
of
the
party
as
they
--
as
they
knew
it.
is
it
your
contention
that
they
could
ask
her
about
all
of
the
a's
on
one
day
and
then
excuse
her
and
ask
her
about
all
the
b's
on
the
next
day
and
all
the
c's
the
next
day
and
take
her
for
26
days
and
convict
her
of
as
many
units
of
contempt
as
there
were
names
read
off
to
her?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
now,
will
you
differentiate
between
that
and
your
position,
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
--
but,
mr.
monahan,
as
i
understood
you
just
a
little
while
ago,
you
answered
in
response
to
one
of
the
justices
that
whether
she
had
relaxed
or
not,
under
your
theory
of
the
case,
she
could
still
be
convicted
of
these
successive
contempts,
did
you
not
say
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
maroney,
if
the
limit
of
the
power
of
the
court
in
civil
of
contempt
is
to
incarcerate
a
person
during
the
proceedings.
do
you
think
that
the
court
should
also
have
the
right
for
the
purpose
of
coercing
to
find
a
person
guilty
of
criminal
contempt
just
so
he
can
punish
her
a
greater
--
in
a
greater
amount
in
order
accomplish
the
same
purpose?
are
you
not
extending
the
jurisdiction
and
the
power
of
the
court
to
punish
for
civil
contempt
when
you
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
--
you
just
told
us
that
you
thought
that
the
judge
might
think
that
two
days
later,
that
because
she
haven't
responded
to
his
coercion
that
he
ought
to
give
her
more
punishment
in
order
to
accomplish
the
same
purpose.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
not
--
did
you
not
say
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
to
grant
--
to
give
her
a
greater
punishment
than
he
could
possibly
give
her
for
civil
contempt.
namely,
to
put
her
in
jail
for
a
period
of
years
after
the
trial
is
over
instead
of
just
until
the
trial
was
completed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
sir.
you
--
you
have
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
--
mr.
maroney,
some
of
the
members
of
the
court
would
like
to
know
if
it
would
be
possible
for
you
to
present
to
us
a
summary
of
the
sentences
that
had
been
imposed
in
recent
years
in
--
for
refusal
to
answer
questions
in
the
federal
courts
and
if
you
also
will
please
note
the
kind
of
case
that
was
involved?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you
very
much.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
number
2,
oleta
o'connor
yates
versus
united
states
of
america.
mr.
branton.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
record
show
that
any
of
these
people
concerning
whom
she
was
questioned
did
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
monahan
assuming
they
can
be
punished
both
civilly
and
criminally,
are
there
any
cases
which
say
whether
or
not
those
convictions
must
be
simultaneously
or
on
the
other
hand
can
the
court
coerce
a
person
for
so
long
under
civil
contempt
and
then
decide
well
that
isn't
working
and
then
call
him
up
and
say
now
i
am
going
to
find
you
--
i
am
going
to
find
you
guilty
of
criminal
contempt.
chief
justice
earl
warren
wouldn't
that,
wouldn't
that
militate
against
your
argument
if
there
was
only
one
contempt
and
she
committed
that
contempt
on
the
first
day
and
the
judge
committed
her
to
jail
to
coerce
her
to
testify
and
then
the
next
day
or
so
he
found
that
she
was
guilty
of
the
same
contempt.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
in
--
under
those
circumstances
then
you
could
have
one
contempt
punishable
by
as
many
refusals
as
she
made
to
answer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
would
you
call
that
one
contempt
if
she
could
be
punished
criminally
maybe
a
dozen
times
and
--
in
addition
to
the
civil
contempt?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
but
my
point
is
this.
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
cases
you
had
read
indicated
that
if
she
was
to
be
committed
both
civilly
and
criminally
that
the
commitment
should
be
--
commitments
should
be
made
simultaneously.
now
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
i
was
talking
about
--
i
was
asking
you
if
there
are
any
cases
that
that
say
that
it
must
be
simultaneous
or
that
they,
that
he
can
hold
her
in
jail
to
coerce
her
for
a
number
of
days
and
then
if
she
isn't
amenable
to
that,
can
he
then
bring
her
up
and
say,
“well
now
you
haven't
--
you
haven't
responded
to
several
contempt
and
i
am
going
to
find
you
guilty
of
criminal
contempt?”
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
supposed
he
had
punished
her
by
consecutive
sentences
in
all
of
these
11
counts,
her
term
of
imprisonment
was
11
years
instead
of
one,
what
would
you
say
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
such
as
you
have
got
here,
take
the
facts
of
this
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
find
her
guilty
of
eleven.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
now
let's
just
take
that,
that
situation
and
suppose
if
those
11
were
all
variations
of
her
contumacious
conduct
and
that
if
he
had
the
right
to
convict
her
of
one,
he
had
the
right
to
convict
her
of
11
and
instead
of
giving
imprisoning
her
for
one
year
by
concurrent
sentences
he
had
given
her
consecutive
sentences
so
that
her
term
would
have
been
11
years
here.
now
you
asked
the
question
what
is
long
and
i,
i
ask
it
in
the
language
of
this
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
let's
don't,
let's
don't
make
the
distinction
--
let's
take
--
let's
say
they
were
all
valid,
but
the
evidence
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
have
as
much
right
to
find
her
guilty
on
one
count
as
he
did
on
all
11
counts
he
did
on
any
one
of
them.
now
you
got
11
counts
here
that
emanate
from
this
case
and
if
didn't,
under
your
theory
here,
it
could
just
as
well
as
not
been
that
way.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
you've
got
11
counts
that
he
finds
her
guilty
on,
he
sentences
her
to
one
year
on
each
count
to
run
consecutively,
what
would
you
say
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understand
you,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
would
have
broken
that
up
into
different
categories
then,
the
government
would
be
through
right
there,
if
she
said
i
won't
answer
any
of
your
questions?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
agree
that
costello
only
committed
one
contempt,
when
he
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
branton.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
go
right
ahead.
