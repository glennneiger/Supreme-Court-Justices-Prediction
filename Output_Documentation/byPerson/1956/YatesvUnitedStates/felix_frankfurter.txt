justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you?
whether
you're
alone
or
your
associate
--
your
associate
will
argue?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
arguments?
three,
four,
how
many?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
get
around
this
early,
would
you
mind
stating
what
identity,
what
differences
there
are
in
the
three
cases
that
are
consolidated
that
you're
arguing,
when
you
get
around
this
mr.
margolis
for
overtime.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
only
difference
is
of
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
this
argument,
that
those
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
main
attacks
or
common
attacks?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
enlighten
me
on
a
point
that
you
(inaudible).
in
the
dennis
case,
there
were
in
fact
over
that
place
whether
or
not
there's
indictment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
that's
what
the
individual
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
speaking
whether
it's
necessary
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
to
say
if
i
--
pardon
me.
that
was
finally
here.
i
just
wondered
what
the
situation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
get
the
convention
on
making
part
of
the
overt
act,
am
i
right
in
(inaudible)
in
what
you
say
that
you
address
yourself
to
the
proposition
the
requirement
of
overt
act
going
back
to
the
origin
of
the
general
conspiracy
statute
would
be
to
satisfy
as
an
overt
act
anything
and
any
other
conspiracy,
conspiracy
before
the
revenue,
conspiracy
to
violate
the
opposing
laws,
has
a
different
greatest
question
by
virtue
of
the
first
amendment
consideration,
different
from
overt
acts
and
other
conspiracy
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
stating
that
argument,
just
stating
the
proposition
what
the
content
or
what
the
significance,
what
kind
of
significance
that
was
demanded
from
overt
act
in
relation
to
the
smith
act
in
the
present
steps
of
the
judicial
code.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
all
of
that
have
to
be
further
required
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
this
is
here,
but
then
you
would
say
speech
can
never
be
a
stuff
of
a
substantive
violation
of
the
smith
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
gather
from
the
proposition
that
you
intended
a
while
ago
that
the
act
must
satisfy
the
requirement
for
the
overt
act,
must
have
a
particular
characteristic
different
from
overt
act
in
search
of
further
evidence.
(inaudible)
why
did
your
argument
--
you
deal
with
it
as
it
has
a
requirement
(inaudible)
why
should
the
argument
of
its
freedom
of
speech
is
protected
not
applied
to
on
overt
acts
that
involves
what
you
call
lawful
speech
in
the
conspiracy
before
the
government
anymore
or
any
less
than
a
conspiracy
to
violate
the
smith
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
lawful
speech
is
protected,
not
to
protect
it,
in
whatever
situation
you
use
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
evidentiary
matters
which
you
just
adverted
are
not
--
do
not
raise
the
question
allegedly
improper
admission
but
merely
go
to
their
significance
in
ways,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
--
why
do
you
round
me
out.
i'd
like
to
ask
another
question
(inaudible).
several
of
your
questions
relate
to
the
charge
of
the
court,
is
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
both
the
granting
and
the
denial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you,
you
are
at
the
trial,
are
you
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
be
good
enough
not
tell
me
what
the
course
in
the
procedure
was
in
the
giving
of
the
charge
specifically,
the
--
or
request
the
charge
submitted
in
advance
to
the
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
denials
thereof
indicated
before
he
charged
that
you
then
accept
to
some
of
his
charges,
would
you
mind
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
one,
the
manner
in
which
the
jury
charges
for
me,
one
of
the
most
important
thing
about
it
was
in
the
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
in
advance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
gave
some
and
denied
others
and
modified
further.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
didn't
have
to
know
what
he
was
going
to
charge
on
his
own
until
you've
heard
it
and
you
then
took
exceptions
within
the
charges?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
just
to
the
doctrine,
did
he
indicate
what
he
was
going
to
charge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
his
own
--
in
his
own
language?
the
language
of
this
matter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
even
of
that
purpose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
--
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
suggesting
any
basis
for
criticism.
i
just
want
to
know
that
then
upon
the
--
the
way
in
which
a
denial
of
a
charge
or
a
granting
of
it,
may
or
may
not
have
extra
weight
in
the
disposition
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
(inaudible)
for
a
judge
to
--
discharge
him
a
grant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
really?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
in
your
--
the
request
and
he's
granting
a
denial
would
indicate
that
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
man
(inaudible)
i'm
not
suggesting
this
is
the
way
i
can
do
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
think
it
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down
mr.
margolis,
with
the
chief
justice's
permission,
i'd
like
to
ask
a
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
make
sure
i
followed
the
(inaudible).
i
understood
that
the
during
the
early
part
of
your
argument,
all
of
the
questions
relate
to
--
in
relation
to
this
case,
generally
with
schneiderman
(inaudible)
and
i
would
like
to
ask
three
questions
in
relation
to
this.
i
understood
that
burden
of
--
the
fore
part
of
your
argument
was
that
the
relation
of
these
defendants
to
the
communist
party
is
of
a
very
different
order
of
condition
in
what
the
relation
of
dennis
and
company,
the
dennis
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
technically,
unless
they
are
not
in
here,
(inaudible)
you
express
the
nature,
and
the
direction,
and
the
purpose
of
the
communist
party
disregarding
for
the
moment
individual
relation,
the
perfectness
and
effort
on
that
part.
in
that
--
in
that
part
of
your
argument,
are
you
questioning
a
conclusion
in
the
inference
of
illegality
or
criminality
brief,
with
reference
to
the
party,
never
mind
the
individual
which
was
one
of
the
essential
conclusions
of
the
dennis
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
so,
is
the
evidence
in
this
case
different
from
the
evidence
that
there's
a
basis
of
the
decision
of
the
dennis
case
on
that
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
to
be
objective
or
to
prove
any
legal
arguments.
i
just
want
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
to
utilize?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
question
of
the
connection
between
the
individuals
and
the
communist
party
which
therefore
brings
significance
of
the
communist
party
of
the
functioning
effort
which
has
a
necessary
consideration
by
the
court.
we're
not
asking
anything
as
i
followed
but
all
or
a
departure
from
anything
that
goes
offensive
in
search
of
the
dennis
case.
i'm
not
saying
you
shouldn't.
i
just
want
to
know
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
that
is
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
thirdly,
you
mentioned
the
schneiderman
case,
rather
than
glancing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
can
be
argued?
very
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
no
more.
justice
felix
frankfurter
indeed
--
indeed
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
pages
of
briefs
are
in
front
of
these
because
any
of
them
give
me
a
list
of
what
would
be
left
of
this
record
in
relation
to
schneiderman
if
you
cut
out
everything
that
is
before
us
in
the
naturalization
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
heart
of
the
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
want
to
ask
it.
now
can
you
tell
us
what
your
knowledge
here
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
would
be
left
if
you
cut
out
of,
for
instance,
these
what,
thousands,
how
many
volumes
we've
got
here,
(inaudible)
what
would
be
--
what
would
be
left
if
you
physically
cut
out,
have
to
legally
cut
out
everything
in
these
green
volume
page,
i
don't
know
how
many
there
are
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
the
volume
is
quite
thick.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
talking
about
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
that
was
essential
of
that
case,
the
fact
that
there
maybe
other
issues
but
not
two
or
one,
unless
it's
a
brand
new
thing,
unless
something
has
happened,
unless
the
communist
party
--
what
was
the
date
of
that,
1942?
1943?
justice
felix
frankfurter
unless
the
communist
party
in
those
days
as
speaking
for
purpose
for
this
case
anything
--
innocent
in
relation
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
but
it
hasn't
now
as
it
perhaps
shows
in
that
has
to
relate
the
climate
of
opinion
and
in
that
period,
was
the
climate
of
opinion
in
the
(inaudible)
wouldn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
schneiderman
was
sought
on
communism,
is
that
the
idea?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
judge
kenny,
i
think
i
must
agree
with
you
on
the
first
part
that
you
would
have
the
case.
the
communist
party
is
of
course
not
a
party
before
this
court.
this
court
of
course
could
make
an
adjudication
with
reference
to
that
party.
but
in
terms
of
estoppel
like
this
one
has
to
see
what
the
issues
were
before
the
court.
i
holding
that's
concede,
what
is
it
that
you
are
worrying
about
in
that
case?
it
would
be
if
you
fight
to
argue.
except
that
it
was
charged,
that
schneiderman,
because
of
his
allegiance
to
promotion
of
official
responsibility
or
an
organization
which
have
these
and
these
or
believing
that
the
overthrow
of
this
government
by
force
and
violence
and
therefore
could
not,
in
good
faith
take
a
note
that
he
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
as
to
me,
what
schneiderman
case
has
decided
if
he
decided
anything?
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
were
the
issues.
i
don't
stand
by
this
and
precisely
some
occasion
to
this
case,
namely,
whether
believe
this,
allegiance
to
promotion
of
it
is
that
you
can
call
the
communist
party
of
the
doctrine,
that
kind
of
views
and
towards
all
the
older
government.
and
if
it
is,
the
fact
that
the
communist
party
happens
to
be,
for
these
are
personalities
which
were
not
before
us
in
which
we're
involved
to
it,
it
seems
to
me
the
period
of
what
was
adjudicated
eventually.
unless
to
you,
unless
you're
insane
or
insane
fellow.
i
think
the
case
is
held
against
him
because
a
man
maybe
certified
an
insane
person
in
1924,
1942,
(inaudible)
you
and
are
take
conviction
of
that
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
dennis
applies
to
this
case
at
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
verdict
analysis
because
on
concept
before
the
1943
it
was
adjudicated
that
his
belief
and
action
for
--
against
the
--
not
violate
the
constitution
of
united
states
because
to
contemplates
--
contemplated
force
and
violence
to
be
overthrown.
now
on
concept
that
the
--
that
was
so
13
years
ago,
it
is
so
now.
and
so,
i
could
take,
no
matter
what
was
litigated
there
is
open
to
the
government
to
make
a
new
showing
--
to
make
a
new
showing
that
there
was
contribution
to
further
imply.
so
i
ask,
what
there
is,
that
they
could
put
out
what
they
were
that
they
were
reviewing
about
the
certificate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
controversy
as
to
the
legitimacy
of
the
questions
from
the
point
of
view
of
admissibility?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
--
that
is
not
--
we
assume
the
questions
were
properly
put?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
the
court
would
properly
rule
--
has
properly
ruled
on
that
degree.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
branton
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
excuse
me
but
i
was
trying
to
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
--
that
means
provides
a
period
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
jury
apply
the
holding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
jury
had
talked
to
him
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
branton.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
if
(inaudible).
the
review
of
that
sentence
is
appropriate
to
be
here
now
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
suggesting
that
there's
anything
in
it
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
your
position
that
this
is
really
a
case
continuing
offense
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
continuing
offense
was
only
a
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
suppose
that
you
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
was
the
situation
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
the
law
requires
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
she
announce
the
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
having
it
under
the
position
and
hearing
the
position
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
do
you
think
that
position
was
neither
illogic
or
was
it
a
matter
of
--
initially
could
be
thought
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
they're
called
policies,
that's
a
different
story.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
agree
you
could
find
things
like
that
in
the
history
(inaudible)
unless
you
were
referring
to
the
matter
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
makes
you
think
(inaudible)
today
--
on
monday,
i
will
testify
and
on
tuesday
or
wednesday,
they
will.
if
there
is
a
man
who
stands
in
the
witness
stand
because
i
think
his
position
is
no,
no,
no,
the
second
question
that
i
understand
to
be
one
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
your
costello
case
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that's
one
more
thing
to
do,
you're
correct
about
this
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
serve
--
serve
the
sentence
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wasn't
a
sentence
(inaudible)
a
civil
contempt,
never
mind
if
it's
civil
or
criminal
contempt
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
again
a
different
case.
it's
all
--
he
continued
to
be
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
are
carrying
this
--
it
fits
almost
the
situation,
is
it
--
there
is
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
witness
has
said,
i
will
not
answer
any
questions
which
tell
you
or
give
the
names
of
the
--
of
the
people
in
the
communist
party.
who's
causing
all
of
those
in
the
future,
or
isn't
that
the
same
as
the
--
in
effect
as
the
other,
maybe
the
other
draw.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
would
you
mind
reading
the
record
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
seen
it
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
monahan?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
embark
on
this
--
what
is
essentially
a
rebuttal
of
what
mr.
margolis
said?
may
i
ask
you
this
because
it
appears
to
your
field,
your
intended
argument,
if
you
were
to
state
part
in
your
views
sighting
the
charge
against
the
petitioner
and
what
in
your
view
the
charge
means
in
order
(inaudible)
so
far
as
it
is
possible
and
to
avoid
those
terms,
those
question
that
in
terms
about
infinite
and
motive
and
all
the
rest,
tell
us
what
in
your
view
indictment
charges
and
what
in
your
view
is
required
to
sustain
the
allegation
with
regards
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this,
i
may
infer
from
what
you
said
that
the
charge
is
participating
in
the
conspiracy
to
teach
with
the
view
of
bringing
about
action,
not
just
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
ideas
--
ideas
or
views,
not
just
the
conspiracy
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
something
--
some
--
some
cerebration
but
that
the
cerebration
can
turn
himself
into
action
that
the
teaching
is
directed
towards
getting
the
disciples
of
this
belief
to
do
something
eventually.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
a
fair
statement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
violent
action.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
merely
to
teach
certain
beliefs?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
care
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
the
substance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
i
may
intervene
in
--
in
this
discussion
on
the
overt
act.
am
i
right
in
assuming
that
the
government's
position,
everything
you've
said
starts
with
the
assumption
going
under
the
assumption
that
an
overt
act
though
necessary
under
the
statute
satisfy
the
requirement
of
a
crime,
overt
act
required
in
this
conspiracy
on
that
(inaudible)
but
it's
the
government's
view
that
no
overt
act
need
be
in
and
of
itself
an
unlawful
action,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
basis
of
the
law
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
yet
finish
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
suggesting.
that's
the
basis
of
the
interchange.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
answers
some
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
maybe
the
making
of
an
innocent
letter
from
your
point
of
view.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
--
i'm
going
to
interrupt
you
not
in
the
view
of
(inaudible)
your
argument
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
you
go
on
with
what's
going
to
be
the
answer
of
the
argument
(inaudible)
would
you
please
state
having
stated
broadly
what
you
concede
to
be
the
nature
of
a
crime
(inaudible),
would
you
please
state
without
the
confusion
of
50
issues
of
more
or
less
unrelated
character,
what
concedes
to
be
the
central
controversy
between
the
government
and
the
petitioner
with
regards
to
the
validity
of
his
conviction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
have
50
points,
the
court
had
said
to
its
mind,
isn't
likely
to
concede?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
inculcation,
approval
or
not.
you
say
approve
in
that
(inaudible)
and
on
one
side
his
action
and
on
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
other
side,
it's
just
getting
into
the
mind
without
intending
eventually
that
the
mind
should
act,
is
that
right?
i
mean
that's
the
controversy
between
you
two.
their
claim
is
that
the
judgment
just
said,
it
did
not
sufficiently
make
the
distinction
which
i
understood
you
two
have
made
a
few
minutes
ago.
namely,
this
is
a
matter
of
conspiracy
to
get
something
in
people's
minds,
but
conspiracy
will
get
onto
the
peoples
minds
with
the
views
that
they
should
act
thereon,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
charge
--
if
the
charge
did
not
sufficiently
make
clear
that
distinction
so
that
ordinary
men
and
women.
were
there
women
on
this
jury?
never
mind
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
were.
so
that
ordinary
men
and
women
would
know
what
the
issues
were
and
should
intelligently
answer
on
this
massive
evidence
which
took
how
many
months
to
apply?
how
many?
justice
felix
frankfurter
six
months.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
care
what
--
i
don't
care
what
it
was.
i'm
suggesting
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
blaming
or
anybody.
i'm
not
remotely
thinking
of
any
fault
to
be
logically
against
anybody.
i'm
suggesting
that
if
you
have
a
trial
of
this
complexity,
extending
over
six
months
at
the
end
of
which
a
jury
of
ordinary,
highly
esteemed,
respectable
but
ordinary
men
and
women
gone
from
all
sorts
of
walks
of
life
were
not
concerned
with
these
problems
the
way
we
lawyers
got
all
the
time,
in
order
that
they
may
reach
a
rational
judgment,
they
must
have
illuminating
guidance
from
the
court,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
--
and
therefore,
if
they
did
not
have
it,
that's
enough
about
this
case,
not
been
able
to
learning
to
stand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
i've
hopes
that
you
will
spend
a
good
deal
of
time
on
this
subject
because
i
don't
mind
telling
you
i
have
the
greatest
difficulty
in
the
advocacy
of
the
court's
charge.

justice
felix
frankfurter
what
does
the
government
--
let
me
change
that.
why
did
the
government
impose
the
charge
from
the
medina
--
from
the
dennis
case
the
trial
court
(inaudible)
justice

it
would
have
been
given
and
appropriately
been
required
additional
interpretation
of

you
could
have
added
that.
justice

what
was
the
date
of
the
book
you're
reading
about?
justice
felix

publication
date?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
was
in
the
record
before
since
--
justice

i
wasn't
questioning
remotely
that
you've
selected
--
justice

i
just
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
nothing
would
follow
from
my
mind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
far
as
old
age
has
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
interest
wasn't
related
to
the
schneiderman
says.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
(voice

everything
they're
told
is
bad
you
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
point
is
that
as
you
read,
excluding
in
a
cloud
of
uncertainty
that
advocate
there
means
is
to
advocate
in
order
to
fill
the
minds
with
different
ideas.
justice

your
(voice

mr.
justice
black
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
you
--
you
talked
of
the
hypothetical
case
put
to
you
by
justice
black,
would
be
centered
by
requirements
of
the
statute
because
it
didn't
--
the
case
put
by
my
brother
black
wasn't
the
case
of
urging
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
indictment
--
i
didn't
hear
the
word
"urging"
was
in
there,
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
point
--but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
advocate
is
a
dubious
term.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
--
but
i
have
to
make
clear
in
the
dennis
case
that,
there
were
charges
which
gave
definitions
of
unequivocal
character,
the
heinous
part
gave
unequivocal
character
to
what
advocate
means
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
is
that
--
it's
that
unequivocal
definition
by
judge
medina
which
the
government
itself
offers
in
this
case
in
which
the
court
declined
to
give.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
controversy.
what
substantially
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
how
much
is
actually
covered?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
for
the
controversies
whether
the
other
language
mean
the
same
thing,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
didn't
have
this
problem
in
the
dennis
case
because
of
the
charge
that
was
given
by
judge
medina.
now,
i'm
not
saying
--
i'm
not
testing
on
the
validity
of
your
argument
which
is
that
judge
mathes
gave
the
substance
of
the
idea
in
different
language
from
that
in
which
judge
medina
is
questioned.
that
is
your
position,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
question.
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
that's
what
companies
are
doing.
if
the
court
has
before
it
a
record
with
one
charge
and
makes,
and
uses
language
that
means
you
approve
that
it
changes
the
language.
it
is
to
be
read
and
considered
in
light
of
the
charge
that
was
in
that
case.
you
can't
pull
that
language
out
and
say
that
covers
different
world.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
read
was
from
the
denaturalization
proceeding,
not
from
the
cross-examination
of
schneiderman,
is
that
right?
what
you've
just
read,
i
just
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
was
from
the
proceeding
into
the
denaturalization.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
didn't
expect
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
much
of
that
testimony
--
how
much
is
put
in
--
in
volume
would
be
--
how
much
of
schneiderman's
testimony
of
the
denaturalization
proceeding
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
of
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
schneiderman
didn't
use
--
utilize
any
of
the
testimonies?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
had
a
vivid
vocabulary?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
say
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
fact
that
schneiderman
had
been
in
the
record
was
now
before
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
there
has
to
be
identity
and
identity
of
issues
in
the
two?
justice
felix
frankfurter
same
--
the
same
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
--
that
is
the
objective
sought
has
to
be
the
same?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
objective
sought.
that
means
that
you've
got
to
ask
for
the
same
thing
--
the
same
--
try
to
get
the
same
kind
of
relief
in
the
two
cases
that
issue
--
that
which
mean?
you
mean
that,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
the
subject
matter
that
was
canvassed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
take
--
to
be
specific.
the
ultimate
issue
in
denaturalization
whether
he
had
falsified.
that
issue
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
the
ultimate
issue.
but
the
--
that
--
that
ultimate
issue
depended
on
whether
or
not
(a)
he
belongs
to
an
organization
which
--
and
his
relation
to
that
organization
was
such.
so
there
was
a
collision,
inconsistent
between
the
purposes
of
the
organization
which
he
was
an
active
member
and
the
implications
before
taking
an
oath
to
become
a
loyal
citizen.
you
can't
take
the
abstract
question,
the
issue
in
that
case
was
denaturalization
case
and
this
case
violates
the
smith
act.
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
i
think
i
--
sorry.
namely,
whether
you're
loyally
attached,
whether
he
was
more
falsely
when
he
took
an
oath.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
1927
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
a
different
question
whether
--
that's
a
very
different
question.
i
find
it
margolis
is
(inaudible)
on
the
insanity.
certainly,
if
there's
a
new
situation
about
status,
you
made
sure
that
there's
a
new
situation
but
--
but
do
you
deny
that
an
issue,
a
subject
matter
for
the
inquiries
which
have
to
be
determined
in
the
schneiderman
case
was
whether
or
not
she's
an
active
member
of
an
organization.
the
purpose
of
which
was
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
united
states
by
force
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
violence
therefore
he
couldn't
practicably
swear
to
be
loyal
to
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
--
is
part
of
that
at
least
an
issue
of
this
case?
namely,
whether
he's
an
active
participant
of
an
organization?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was.
it
had
to
be
because
you
have
to
decide
whether
he
has
such
relation
to
the
communist
party
or
the
communist
party
was
what
it
was
in
order
to
determine
whether
there's
a
collision
of
loyalty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
how
can
the
court
issue
the
conclusion
(inaudible).
what
was
all
the
stuff
that
was
put
in
there
lenin,
stalin,
all
these
to
me
very
important
so
far
as
literature
is
concerned,
the
stuff
that
we
agreed
in
that
case.
what
was
all
that
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
those
classic
--
those
doctrines
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
prohibits
them
--
the
question
before
them
is
no
--
that
wouldn't
show
any
conflict
to
invoke
as
a
loyal
citizen,
would
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
the
lower
court
did.
that
--
on
that
ground
the
schneiderman
decision
--
schneiderman's
limitations
here,
is
that
right?
what
you've
just
said
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
mean
the
reverse
of
that
was
the
law
of
course.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
nature
of
his
activities
in
relation
to
the
communist
party
was
open
roof
of
that
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
did
it
decide?
unless,
it
decided
that
the
lower
court
was
wrong
in
attacking
deleterious
implication
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
the
materials
here
are
the
same
materials
pinned
down
to
the
communist
party,
aren't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
different
point
on
one
hand.
i've
--
i've
no
doubt
about
it
that
you
can
show
or
rather
be
open
that
the
government
show
that
what
was
true
in
1937
and
1943
when
the
schneiderman
case
is
decided.
was
true
because
in
those
days,
that
was
a
benign
organization
and
now
it's
not
a
benign
organization.
and
then
it
would
be
open
to
the
other
side
and
getting
all
the
experts
on
the
subject
as
to
what
(inaudible)
what
he
doesn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
questioning.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
questioning
that
the
merits
of
the
decision
went
one
way
rather
than
another.
that
--
that's
what
all
that
talk
means
because
what
was
the
difference
in
the
majority
and
minority
in
the
schneiderman
case
except
the
difference
on
what
was
allowable
--
an
allowable
deduction
by
the
commissioner
if
that
was
his
name
in
the
courts
below
as
to
the
meaning
of
this
evidence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
on
--
most
of
your
evidence
--
most
that's
above
your
evidence
at
the
start
isn't
it?
plus
the
--
plus
the
relation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
but
the
--
the
only
question
is
whether
this
man
can
be
differed.
most
of
which
was
before
us
in
the
first
schneiderman
case,
is
not
necessarily
--
is
not
necessarily
a
canvas
plus
some
other
consideration
of
being
different
canvass
in
the
first
schneiderman
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
all
that
but
collateral
estoppel
doesn't
mean
that
the
two
litigations
must
be
identical.
collateral
estoppel,
as
i
understand
it
means
that
some
issue
that
was
canvass
in
one
litigation
no
matter
what
the
subsequent
result
was,
is
again
in
controversy
in
the
later
end.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
collateral
estoppel
doesn't
concern
itself
what
the
merits
of
the
decision
was.
it
concerns
itself
the
fact
that
included
in
the
decision
or
the
range
of
equality
which
is
now
again
the
range
of
equality.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
couldn't
--
there
has
to
be
identity
of
partnership.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
law
there
are
three
situations,
three
doctrines.
all
of
which
goes
to
the
point
that
a
thing
that's
been
litigated
to
us
shouldn't
be
relitigated
with
the
same
party.
the
doctrine
collateral
estoppel,
doctrine
res
judicata,
doctrine
of
double
jeopardy
all
applies
to
either
criminal
case
and
they
apply
on
a
fortiori
under
criminal
case.
so,
there
you
have
the
extra
consideration
that
you
shouldn't
harass
a
defendant
more
than
once,
either
for
the
regard
at
the
same
time
or
regard
to
the
determination
of
(inaudible)
which
is
part
and
apply
a
proceeding.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
how
do
you
know
the
jury
would
have
so
found.
it's
a
question
of
what
you
now
agree
leading
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that's
the
question
that
went
to
the
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
monahan,
yet
by
way
of
--
before
you
sit
down,
cover
up
one
thing.
i
think
it's
important.
you
will
be
arguing
i
take
it
eventually,
and
i
understand
this
correctly,
this
question
of
what
organized
in
all
--
an
organizational
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
i
--
i
have
no
logic
to
say
that
--
the
concept,
the
responsibility
in
the
burden.
i
just
want
you
to
show
when
you've
come
to
that
question,
to
argue
the
point
that
it
made
in
your
brief,
pages
94
and
95.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
whether
the
government
don't
concede
that
--
i
have
no
issue
of
the
matter
that
it
was
not.
if
you
want
to
bear
in
mind
in
contrary.
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
you
further.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
it
comes
to
that
point.
would
you
please
deal
with
the
government's
position
that
even
though
the
government
maybe
wrong
(inaudible)
what
organize
mean.
it
doesn't
matter
because
the
conviction
can
be
held
under
the
score
of
(inaudible).
that
is
your
position
in
the
brief
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
when
you
come
to
the
crux
of
that,
that
question,
can
you
please
bear
--
bear
in
mind
my
difficulty,
namely,
that
this
is
not
a
situation,
so
that's
fine,
i
just
want
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
you.
that
this
is
not
a
case
of
pre
(inaudible)
if
there's
anyone
of
you
who
imposed
the
word.
it
may
well
be
--
it
may
well
be
that
under
the
indictment,
judge
mathes
could
have
charged
the
jury
that
the
convicted
defendant
if
you
find
either,
you
find
that
you're
disjunctive
either
they
could
file
the
application
or
conspired
to
order,
if
yet
so
charge
then
your
argument
would
be
briefly
valid.
but
whether
he
--
needlessly
charge
that
they
must
find
that
they
both
advocated
and
organized,
then
the
argument
that
you've
made
seems
to
me
not
justified
by
the
accepted
(inaudible)
because
he
told
the
jury,
"don't
answer
unless
when
it
comes,"
he
told
the
jury
that
they
must
find
both,
although
he
probably
will
follow
and
so
forth.
but
since
he
told
that
we
(inaudible)
when
you
come
to
that
point
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
suit
yourself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suit
yourself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
--
you
ask
the
two
upon
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
assuming
that
he
mischarged
them
unorganized
that
he
misinstructed
on
organized,
that's
the
whole
point.
if
he
--
if
he
instructed
them
properly,
there
is
no
problem.
but
if
he
instructed
them
improperly
as
to
what
organized
mean.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
how
do
we
know
if
he
charged
him
properly
under
organize
they
would
have
so
found?
how
do
we
know
that
if
he
had
charged
them
properly,
as
to
what
organize
mean
and
he
assumed
that
he
charged
them
for
purpose
of
this
argument
improperly
that
they
then
would
have
brought
in
that
verdict.
justice
felix
frankfurter
both.
but
one
of
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
ther
were
told
to
find
is
a
thing
they
had
no
business
to
find
under
the
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
did
find
them
guilty
of
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
found
them
--
they
found
them
guilty
of
advocacy
and
organized
as
the
judge
defined
organized.
justice
felix
frankfurter
an
accumulated
statement
of
what
the
jury
brought
in.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
--
because
they
had
to
out
of
the
judge's
instructions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
and
one
of
the
things
on
which,
they
both
included
something
that
was
erroneously
found.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
both
included
one
half
which
was
an
error.
that
we
don't
know
what
the
relation,
we
need
to
have
word.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
the
error.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
have
to
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
know.
i
wasn't
in
the
jury
room.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
i
don't
know
how
they
acted
on
it.
they
were
told
to
find,
they
must
find
a
and
b
and
they
come
up
and
found
a
and
b
being
on
(inaudible)
on
the
assumption
that
was
erroneously
charged
verdict.
and
therefore,
i
don't
know
whether
they
were
brought
in
a,
if
they
had
a
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
can't
get
any
help
from
both
because
one
of
them
is
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
afraid
i
can't
make
it
clearer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
didn't
mean
to
read
that
part.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
sir.
i
--
now
i
think,
i'll
--
i'll
take
up
now
the
point
about
the
propriety
of
the
instruction
unorganized.
the
judge
instructed
the
jury
that
the
verb
organized
as
used
in
the
smith
act
and
the
indictment
include
--
this
is
on
page
935
of
106
f.supp.the
second
column
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
page."
the
verb
organized,
as
used
in
the
smith
act
and
the
indictment
includes
the
recruiting
of
new
members
and
the
forming
of
new
units
and
the
regrouping
or
expansion
of
existing
club,
classics
and
other
units
of
any
society,
party,
group,
or
other
organization."
now,
the
essence
of
the
petitioner's
contention
is
that
the
communist
party
was
organized
in
1945.
and
that
therefore,
more
than
three
years
had
elapsed
between
that
date
and
the
return
of
the
indictment
in
this
case
with
the
result
that
the
organizing
clause
of
the
smith
act
as
a
prosecution
under
the
organizing
clause
of
the
smith
act
was
barred
by
limitations.
now,
it
is
the
governments
contention
that
that
is
erroneous,
super
--
super
technical
contention.
organize,
we
say
within
the
meaning
of
the
smith
act,
is
a
continuing
process.
it
goes
on
from
day-to-day
and
no
one
recognizes
this
fact
better
than
the
communist
party
itself.
what
is
the
name
of
the
leader
of
an
of
--
of
a
unit
of
the
party?
the
--
the
name
of
the
leader
is
the
organizer.
what
is
the
name
of
this
--
of
the
second
in
command?
oleta
--
oleta
yates
with
the
second
in
command
of
the
california
party,
the
organizational
secretary
or
oleta
yates
testifies
herself
in
this
case
that
one
of
her
duties
as
organizational
secretary
is
to
recruit
members
to
make
the
party
a
bigger
organization.
the
organization
of
a
communist
party
is
not
static.
once
done
and
forever
accomplished
sort
of
the
event
that
the
petitioners
claim.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
adding
new
members
to
impose
self-organizing,
an
active
drive
to
bring
life
for
(inaudible)
organization
and
making
it
more
dynamic,
is
that
organizing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
want
to
add
breaking
up
and
having
you
--
suppose
there's
an
organization,
a
rather
sleeping
kind
of
an
organization
along
with
vigorous
--
i
don't
mean
--
a
vigorous
young
fellow
and
he
sets
it
up
and
included
as
a
membership,
is
that
organizing
under
the
smith
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is?
you
would
have
to
--
that
is
so
under
judge
mathes'
charge,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that's
really
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
clearly
the
issue
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i'm
trying
--
just
trying
to
find
out
what
the
problem
--
that
is
the
problem,
isn't
it?recruitment
is
organizing.
recruitment
is
organize
under
the
judge's
charge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
organization?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
is
a
(inaudible)
is
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
is
that
he
affirm
--
that
he
instructive
affirmatively
what
it
was
and
therefore,
the
failure
to
deny
what
it
want,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
(inaudible)
he
gave
the
paragraph
that
he
just
keeps
following
the
words
to
which
you've
just
referred
about
advocate
etcetera.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
disavow
of
giving
a
meaning
that
it
restricted
with
entertainment
of
ideas.
justice
felix
frankfurter
entertain.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
one
agrees
with
you,
what
issues
are
left
in
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
--
that
isn't
the
normal
call
if
the
reversal
on
a
question
of
law
will
took
care
of
it
on
concept,
what
you
call
insufficiency
of
evidence
may
involve
a
judgment
as
to
the
requirements
of
the
law,
the
government
may
had
one
view
with
the
trial,
to
their
great
surprise
the
court
reversing
that
--
rejects
that
view.
why
haven't
--
why
do
you
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
doubt
about
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
but
the
government
may
have
had
its
theory
then
or
i
don't
what
was
the
relevant
law
that
this
trial
judge
may
have
the
same
theory.
the
court
of
appeals
claimed
he
had
a
theory
that
this
was
sufficient.
and
here
they
--
for
purposes
of
this
discussion,
this
court
said,
“no”.
he
didn't
have
enough
or
he
didn't
have
the
kind
of
evidence
that
the
statute
requires.
whereas
the
government
allowed
you
to
raise,
lifted
your
jeopardy.
why
is
the
government
obliged
to
just
say,
well
he
didn't
know
the
statute
requires
this.
he
could
have
not
said
so
and
he
can
meet
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
put
to
you
this
consideration.
suppose
i
--
suppose
i'm
convinced
that
the
charge
was
one
in
one
respect
or
another.
suppose
i
conclude
that
the
charge
has
been
adequate
for
this
or
that
reason,
since
i
didn't
go
through
the,
how
many?
fifteen
thousand
page,
evident
and
say,
“i
don't
think
we
ought
to
direct
these
people
because
i
think
the
evidence
is
sufficient.”
i
should
hesitate
long
before
i
think
i
ought
to
tell
in
case
there
has
to
be
a
new
trial
that
the
evidence
is
sufficient.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
not
a
very
--
that's
not
a
--
that
has
its
serious
disadvantages
for
the
supreme
court
to
be
announcing
announce
that
the
evidence
is
sufficient
only
if
a
judge
get
the
right
words,
the
next
time
he
charge
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
i'm
putting
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
a
book
can
be
less
evident
the
fact
that
it's
written
testimony
instead
of
oral
testimony
doesn't
make
it
less
demanding
in
taking
up
your
judgment
what
it
all
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
make
it
necessary
to
read
the
books?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
documentary
instructions
during
those
six
days?
they're
just
out
six
days,
how
many?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
years?
how
many
working
hours
do
they
have
everyday?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
coming
under
the
court
to
see.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
six
days,
is
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
answer
to
no
further
instruction
or
is
to
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
it
seems
to
me
rather
to
me
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
take
that
position?
let's
forget
about
this
case
as
a
communist
case
and
think
of
any
other
case,
bankruptcy
case.
a
bankruptcy
as
i
understand
is
being
examined
as
to
its
assets.
he
review
this
grant
for
questions
on
monday
and
the
judge
then
finds
him
guilty
of
civil
contempt
and
he
says,
"i
put
you
away
overnight
so
that
you
may
think
about
it
and
see
whether
you
know
want
to
make
up
you
mind
and
answer."
and
he
keeps
on
and
added
to
the
recalcitrancy
and
on
thursday,
he
still
continuously
recalcitrant
if
the
court
says
this
is
an
obstruction
of
justice,
and
i
will
now
cite
you
for
criminal
contempt.
why
then
--
why
doesn't
a
contempt
continue
just
to
the
conspiracy
proceeding.
and
does
the
sentencing
for
civil
contempt
on
monday
preclude
and
the
court
taking
notice
to
continue
the
contempt
as
a
criminal
kind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
very
different
from
saying
--
for
them
talking
about
of
this
one
offense
or
seven
offenses?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
this
court
has
known
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
cohabitation
is
an
offense.
the
nature
of
which
is
continuity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
offense,
as
one
offense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
whether
you
cohabit
for
two
days
or
four
days,
you
can't
be
separately
tried
for
two
days
and
four
days?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
haven't
got
two
offenses
here.
we've
got
a
civil
contempt
which
is
the
court's
remedy
to
secure
specific
performance
as
it
were.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
has
no
criminal
ingredient
and
a
criminal
contempt
is
a
totally
different
thing,
there's
a
vindication
of
the
process
of
justice,
whereby
justice
can
be
teared
down
in
a
very
different
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
answer
is
no,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
for
the
same
conduct.
i'm
not
talking
about
the
same
language.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
couldn't
--
he
couldn't
--
for
failure
on
monday
when
he
submitted
her
until
she
could
answer
and
said
nothing
about
any
so-called
criminal
contempt
action,
he
couldn't
retrospective
to
say,
"now,
looking
back,
i'm
going
to
put
you
in
jail
for
what
did
it
last
monday."
justice
felix
frankfurter
non-concept
that
a
witness
who
refuses
to
testify
on
monday
and
the
judge
can
think
about
it
and
i
put
you
on
jail,
non-concept
the
judge
may
not
hit
that
kind
of
structure
of
justice.
he
may
merely
want
the
exact
testimony
for
the
pertinacity
of
continuing
refusal
constitutes
a
new
thing,
namely,
obstruction
of
justice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
this
record
bears
that
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
analyze
the
process.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
remind
us,
but
i'm
sure
we'd
be
glad
to
have
your
enlightenment.
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that
for
conduct
either
of
omission
of
commission
of
omission,
what
she
refused
on
june
30th,
she
had
already
completely
refused
on
june
26th
that's
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
record
bear
that
out?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
suppose
a
witness
says
on
june
26th
i'm
not
going
to
answer
any
of
your
questions
and
give
no
reason,
if
the
witness
says
i'm
not
going
to
answer
any
of
your
questions,
that
would
comprehend,
that
would
be
inclusive
of
all
particulars,
but
if
she
says
i'm
not
going
to
answer
your
question
because
i
don't
want
to
get
other
people
into
trouble,
then
that
generalization
doesn't
cover
the
particulars,
because
the
particular
maybe
outside
of
the
generalization,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
are
the
facts
or
reference
to
what
happens
as
between
what
she
said
on
the
26th
and
what
said
on
june
30th?
in
other
words,
the
counsel
in
asking
that,
the
district
attorney
would
have
to
find
out
in
each
case
whether
the
particular
person
about
whom
he
sought
answers,
came
within
formula,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
can
you
say
that
the
record
establishes
that
as
to
each
person
of
whom
she
was
asked,
about
whom
she
was
asked
on
june
30th
automatically
was
included
in
her
refusal
of
june
26th.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
before
you
give
me
the
example
just
give
me
the
facts.
is
it
that
you're
saying
that
when
he
--
what
about
smith,
what
jones,
what
about
robinson,
she
said
each
one
of
these
fellows
i've
dealt
with
on
june
26th,
i
told
you
i'm
not
going
to
answer
anything
to
bring
trouble
to
any
of
my
friends,
is
that
the
fact?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
under
three?
are
you
conceding
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
how
do
we
determine
whether
it's
under
one
or
three?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
we
determine
whether
it's
one
or
three?
justice
felix
frankfurter
disobedience
of
resistance
to
its
lawful
writ
process
or
a
rule,
decree
or
command.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
government
thinks
it
was
under
three,
what
did
the
judge
do
who
actually
committed
it,
did
he
put
it
under
three?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
look
at
the
left
half
of
the
judgment,
the
certificate
of
the
judge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
order
of
judgment,
the
certificate
of
criminal
contempt,
always
good
to
go
to
the
text
of
documents
when
we
talk
about
documents.
justice
felix
frankfurter
read
it
(inaudible)
read
it
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
what
do
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
say
now,
in
the
actual
presence
of
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that
phrase
found?
that's
found
in
one
and
not
in
three.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
could
maybe
under
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
before
--
this
is
very
vital,
don't
go
off
on
this,
without
facing
it.
it's
a
very
important
topic.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
that
if
--
it
isn't
that
you're
not
facing
it
because
if
you're
damaged,
quite
the
contrary.
contended
statute
401
has
three
clauses,
presumably
defines
its
own
particularity,
and
when
a
judge
fines
somebody
for
contempt
he
must
issue
a
certificate
and
he
must
formulate
a
judgment.
and
as
plain
as
a
pikestaff
to
me
what
this
court,
what
this
judge
did
was
to
find
the
violation
of
one
and
not
of
three,
because
the
phrase
in
the
presence
of
the
court
is
only
in
one
and
not
in
three.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suggest
you
insist
on
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that's
misbehavior,
if
a
fellow
doesn't
answer
questions
when
he
is
told
to
answer
and
obstructs
the
course
of
justice,
that's
misbehavior.
i
don't
know
what
more
misbehavior
you
could
have.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
a
finding
of
contempt
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suggest
that
if
you
have
to
use
every
word,
in
one,
two
or
three
then
there
is
nothing
said
about
disobeying
a
lawful
writ,
pass
this
order
(inaudible)
command,
is
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can't
get
anymore
out
of
a
judgment,
than
you
can
get
out
of
the
order
judgment,
then
you
can
get
out
of
the
certificate
because
that's
incorporated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
misbehavior
doesn't
mean
you
must
draw
an
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
to
(inaudible)
something
you
said
in
--
a
minute
ago
namely
that
what
she
was
asked,
the
government
either
had
in
this
case
or
the
information
was
available,
didn't
you
say
something
like
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
appear
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
does
it
appear?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
i
mean
on
the
main
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
your
suggestion,
your
argument
is
that
she
couldn't
obstruct
or
disobey
or
obstruct
or
have
anything
that
really
interfered
with
the
process
of
the
law
in
this
trial
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
the
question
which
he
refused
to
answer
were
in
fact
in
possession
of
or
indeed
produced
by
the
government,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course
it
may
become
important
sometimes,
to
illicit
conformation
of
a
trial
witness.
the
jury
may
believe
one
witness
more
than
another
witness
or
the
jury
may
have
doubt,
except
when
three
witnesses
say
the
same
thing
then
doubt
becomes
conferred,
dissipated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
do
you
say
that,
that
applies
to
subdivision
three
or
law
of
obstruction
isn't
mentioned
as
well
as
the
subdivision
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
say
that
--
are
you
suggesting
that
if
hudgins
is
found,
if
hudgins'
law,
as
it
has
been
decided
in
that
case,
which
have
since
been
referred
to
and
relied
upon,
holding
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
witnesses
commit
perjury,
isn't
in
and
of
itself
an
obstruction,
that
while
it
couldn't
be
deemed
an
obstruction,
for
reasons
given
in
that
opinion
by
the
then
chief
justice,
that
they
could
label
it
a
disobedience
to
an
order,
that
would
take
care
of
hudgins,
is
that
it?
one
would
--
are
you
suggesting
that
one
would
reach
that
alternative?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
in
hudgins
they
dealt
with
perjury
and
said
it
wasn't
an
obstruction,
or
could
the
hudgins
conclusion
be
avoided
by
calling
it
not
an
obstruction,
but
a
disobedience
of
an
order?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
revert
to
your
answer
to
justice
harlan's
question,
that
hudgins
is
perjury
because
there
the
witness
did
answer,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suggest
that
the
order
of
a
witness
when
he
is
asked
the
question
is
derived
from
the
oath
that
he
takes
to
answer
truthfully,
not
just
to
answer.
the
command
is
to
answer
truthfully,
and
i
don't
think
that
a
perjurious
answer
is
an
obedience
of
a
question
for
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
it
would
have
profited
us
if
you
had
printed
as
an
appendix
to
your
brief
the
series
of
questions,
the
whole
record
in
hudgins
case,
which
was
the
persistence
not
only
alleged
perjury,
alleged
lies,
but
also
evasion
as
you
point
out,
that
as
judge
there
pointed
out,
its
believed
they
did
and
when
a
man
is
on
the
witness
stand,
he
doesn't
fulfill
the
order
to
answer
what
is
relevant
by
(inaudible)
must
be
words
that
are
full
and
truthful.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
they
reciprocally
exclusive,
do
you
think?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
say
more
than
this
with
definitiveness,
that
in
order
to
come
under
one
it
has
to
be
some
conduct
or
absence
of
conduct
directed
in
the
presence
of
the
court,
that
one
deals
with
things
that
happen
in
the
court.
(inaudible)
so
i'm
behaving,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
know
but
legislation
isn't
that
scientific?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
is
the
direction
of
a
court
to
a
witness
to
answer
a
question,
you
claim
that
is
an
order,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
wasn't
it
an
order
in
hudgins?
much
more
of
an
order,
almost
than
here
because
how
to
remember
who
the
judge
was,
a
very
good
judge
who
presided
in
that
case
thousands
of
years
ago,
he
constantly
told
hudgins
you
must
answer
this,
don't
evasive,
you
answer
this,
and
then
he
gave
round
about
questions,
wasn't
that
an
order
or
a
command?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
must
have
been
an
order
if
this
was
an
order.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
not
wholly
as
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
but
wasn't
that
--
wasn't
he
ordered
to
answer,
didn't
the
judge
there
say,
i
asked
him
again
and
again
and
he
evaded,
wasn't
that
a
--
wouldn't
you
call
that
an
order?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
not
a
disobedience,
what's
the
other
word,
resistance
to
an
order,
i
put
it
to
you
that
when
a
judge
says,
“will
you
answer
that?”
he
means
will
you
answer
that
truthfully,
not
when
you
just
utter
some
sound.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
precisely
and
that's
why
the
denial
of
it
is
a
disobedience
of
an
order.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
why
i
am
asking
you
therefore
if
you
start
with
that
i
am
asking
you
this,
may
hudgins
be
avoided
simply
by
saying
it's
an
order
and
that
cares
of
the
decision
in
hudgins.
by
having
a
judge
say
this
witness
has
purged
himself
flagrantly
again
and
again
i
put
because
the
court
put
questions
to
him
in
that
case,
i
had
asked
him
questions,
he
evaded
these
and
so
i
ordered
him
to
answer
truthfully
will
that
take
care
of
hudgins,
if
it
does
then
it's
really
playing
tricks
with
words.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
monahan.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
clearing
up
something
for
me,
i
find
it
difficult
to
the
point
of
impedance
to
understand
how
any
disobedience
or
resistance
to
an
order
of
the
court
lawfully
issued
and
therefore
within
the
authority
of
the
court
and
relevant
to
the
proceeding
before
it,
how
a
disobedience
or
resistance
to
such
an
order
can
fail
to
be
an
obstruction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
maybe
we
are
waiting
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
this
wasn't
relevant,
the
court
has
no
business
to
answer
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well,
so
assuming
both
of
those
and
my
phrasing
it
doesn't
state
the
problem,
the
particular
problem
fairly,
then
correct
it,
but
if
a
court
issues
an
order
that
is
relevant
and
within
the
power
of
the
court
for
the
fair
conduct
and
disposition
of
a
litigation,
why
isn't
that
inherently
an
obstruction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
do
not
because
there
are
lots
of
disobediences
which
are
interferences
with
the
fair
conduct
of
justice
that
do
not
happen
in
the
presence
of
a
court
and
to
me
that's
the
vital
thing
between
one
and
three.
justice
felix
frankfurter
certainly
but
--
therefore
you
have
to
have
more
than
one
because
one
requires
in
the
presence
of,
and
if
this
court
sends
the
marshal
out
to
give
notice
to
somebody
about
something
within
its
power
and
at
the
other
end
of
the
district
you
couldn't
get
him
under
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
all
i
am
saying
is
–
i'm
suggesting
that
it's
a
presupposition,
obstruction
is
a
presupposition
of
breach
and
that
you
cannot
--
you
cannot
have
a
judgment
of
disobedience
and
resistance
without
necessarily
implying
thereby
and
requiring
thereby
obstruction
and
therefore
what
hudgins
says
about
what
obstruction
means
becomes
relevant,
that's
the
direction
of
my
thinking
on
this
subject.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well,
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
takes
care
of
it,
it
takes
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
would
you
allow
me
to
make
a
correction
or
a
qualification
or
elucidation
on
this
question
of
obstruction
because
i
--
for
me
that
that
is
one
of
the
vital
aspects
of
this
case.
i
quite
agree
with
you,
i
thoroughly
agree
with
you
that
if
you
have
a
clear
case
of
a
disobedience
or
resistance
to
a
court
order,
you
do
not
have
affirmatively
to
prove
obstruction
because
it
is
implied
from
my
point
of
view,
but
the
question
is
whether
you
may
negative
the
implication
by
disproving
obstruction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
because
i
say
it's
inherent
in
a
--
that's
my
point,
resistance
and
disobedience
inherently
implies
obstruction
and
therefore
the
government
in
a
particular
or
the
judge
in
a
particular
case
said,
“i
issue
this
order,
i
told
you
to
be
here
at
10:00
on
tuesday
and
you
weren't
there
and
that's
a
disobedience
of
the
court.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is,
but
then
the
other
person
can
explain
why
it
wasn't
a
disobedience
if
he
had
a
telephone
call
from
one
of
the
officials
of
the
court
who
told
him
that
it
isn't
necessary?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no.
well
but
there
is
involvement
in
this
case
whether
and
i
think
seriously
involved
whether
the
requirements
of
hudgins
as
to
what
constitutes
obstruction
is
present
in
this
case.
