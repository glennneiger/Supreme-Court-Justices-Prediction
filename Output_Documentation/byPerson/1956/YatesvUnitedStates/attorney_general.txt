mr.
attorney
general
your
honor,
i
would
estimate
that
they
were
work
nine
or
ten
hours
a
day.
mr.
attorney
general
i
think
during
that
period
of
time
if
they
work
from
9:30
or
10
until
six.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
sir.
well,
they
came
in
with
a
verdict
on
the
afternoon.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right,
sir.
