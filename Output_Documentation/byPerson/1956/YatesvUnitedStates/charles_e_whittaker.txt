justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
branton
may
i
ask
you,
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
only
reason
she
gave
for
refusing
to
answer
the
questions
on
the
26th
were
the
same
that
she
gave
for
refusing
to
answer
on
the
29
–
on
the
30th.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
did
she
not
on
the
–
in
refusing
to
answer
the
questions
on
the
30th
of
june
say
that
she
wouldn't
answer
questions
that
she
thought
would
hurt
anyone?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
perhaps
not,
but
then
you
tell
us
how
one
could
tell,
how
the
trial
judge
could
tell
what
questions
she
thought
would
or
would
not
hurt
anyone?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
this
is
page
27
of
the
record?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
thank
you.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
min
dif
i
ask,
the
refusal
(inaudible)
that
it
follows
there
is
not
obstruction
(inaudible)
but
nevertheless
it
would
be
a
direct
disobedience
of
an
order
of
the
court
to
answer,
wouldn't
it?
and
wouldn't
that
therefore
constitute
in
the
direct
language
of
subdivision
three,
a
refusal
to
comply
with
order
of
the
court,
to
answer
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
i
understand
you
to
say
(inaudible)
by
declining
to
answer
nothing
can
be
done
about
as
contempt?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
relying
on
the
hudgins?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
i
don't
think
you're
testifying,
i
think
you're
not
telling
the
truth,
therefore
i
find
you
guilty
of
perjury,
is
that
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
my
point
of
view.
in
other
words
you've
got
to
answer
questions
in
such
a
manner
as
satisfies
the
trial
court
that
you're
telling
the
truth
or
you
maybe
sentenced
for
perjury,
that's
what
the
trial
court's
theory
there
was,
not
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
word
