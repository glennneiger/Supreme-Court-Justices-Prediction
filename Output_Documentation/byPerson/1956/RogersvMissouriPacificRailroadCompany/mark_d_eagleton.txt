mr.
mark
d.
eagleton
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
mark
d.
eagleton
this
is
an
action
that
was
brought
in
the
st.
louis
circuit
court
for
damages
suffered
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner,
james
c.
rogers,
while
in
the
employ
of
the
missouri
pacific
railroad
company
at
garner,
arkansas
on
july
17th,
1951.
it
was
brought
under
the
terms
and
provisions
of
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
on
this
--
in
the
pleadings.
both
parties
conceded
that
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendant
that
lower
courts
level
were
subject
to
the
provisions
of
that
act.
the
plaintiff,
the
petitioner
here,
proceeded
to
trial
on
april
12th,
1954,
and
for
three
days
following
that,
recovered
a
judgment
by
the
court
and
the
jury
in
a
sum
of
$40,000.
and
after
judgment
have
been
entered,
the
defendant
in
that
case,
the
respondent
here,
missouri
pacific
railroad
company
appealed
to
the
missouri
supreme
court,
which
reversed
the
judgment
outright
holding
that
the
petitioner
had
not
made
a
submissible
case.
thereafter,
this
court
granted
certiorari,
bringing
us
here
because
of
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
was
final
as
of
that
time.
we
contend
the
petitioner
that
the
ruling
of
the
state
court
was
wrong,
not
only
because
it
was
in
the
teeth
of
the
decisions
of
this
court,
but
because
it
based
its
decision
on
facts
that
were
not
warranted
inferences
and
facts
not
warranted
either
by
the
evidence,
the
submission
of
the
case
or
the
instructions
granted
by
the
court.
the
whole
answer
to
the
case
will
have
to
be
found
in
the
facts,
and
while
they
are
somewhat
extensive,
they
are
simple
in
their
very
nature,
and
i
will
as
quickly
as
i
can,
with
the
chronicle
--
chronological
order,
attempt
to
give
your
honors
a
review
of
those
facts.
in
this
particular
case,
the
plaintiff,
petitioner
was
24
years
of
age
at
the
time
of
his
injury
on
july
17th,
1951.
he'd
been
employed
by
the
railroad
company
some
six
or
seven
weeks
prior
to
that
particular
injury.
at
the
time
they
were
working
at
garner,
arkansas
on
a
roadbed
and
track
that
ran
in
general
direction,
north
and
south,
the
north
bound
track
or
the
east
track
was
for
the
north
bound
trains
and
the
west
track
would
be
necessarily
for
the
south
bound
trains.
there
were
only
two
tracks.
they
cover
the
space
when
laid
down
on
the
ties
and
the
ballast
in
between
the
ties
are
some
15
or
20
feet,
which
might
be
referred
to
as
the
roadbed.
the
work
the
petitioner
was
doing
was
the
burning
of
weeds
along
the
western
side
of
this
north
and
south
track.
these
weeds
have
been
prepared
for
burning
previously
by
having
then
sprayed
by
chemical
the
purpose
of
which
was
indeed
cause
the
weeds
to
dry
and
to
be
ready
to
immediate
ignition
when
they're
torched
or
some
force
of
that
kind
was
applied.
a
particular
torch
that
he
was
given
to
do
this
work
was
a
rather
improvised
quart
can
of
oil.
it
had
two
spouts,
one
on
either
side
coming
out
on
a
45-degree
angle
in
one
of
which
spouts
rags
serving
as
a
wick.
they
were
--
were
placed
and
on
the
other
spout
of
this
45-degree
angle
was
inserted
a
stick
or
handle
about
three
feet
long.
the
particular
place
of
work
which
becomes
important
here
was
about
250
to
300
yards
north
of
what
is
called
the
garner
crossing.
and
the
work
intended
was
to
burn
these
weeds
which
for
the
most
part
were
to
the
west
of
the
petitioner
as
he
would
work
from
south
to
north.
in
other
words,
he
would
be
working
on
the
west
shoulder
of
this
right
of
way.
the
shoulder
itself
was
defined
as
being
a
space
beginning
with
the
western
edge
of
the
ties
and
extending
to
the
west
about
three
to
three
and
a
half
feet.
and
if
we
look
further
to
the
west,
we
go
down
to
his
left
as
he
goes
north
or
to
his
west
side
as
to
what
is
called
a
dump,
which
is
lower
than
the
roadbed,
which
is
up
above
it.
now,
the
weeds
were
about
two
and
a
half
to
three
feet
in
width
to
the
west
of
his
shoulder
and
extending
in
part
down
into
the
dump.
he
would
take
this
ignited
torch
and
apply
it
to
these
specially
prepared
weeds
for
burning.
on
this
particular
case
on
how
he
succeeded
with
that
job
and
how
he'd
gone
along
without
any
difficulty,
he
would
have
gone
up
to
the
culvert
which
is
in
question
here.
in
that
culvert,
it
was
253
yards
north
of
the
garner
crossing
where
he
started
all
of
his
work.
he
remembers
on
the
west
side.
and
after
getting
to
the
crossing,
he
would
then
have
gone.
he
didn't
get
there,
but
he
would
have
been
have
gone
200
yards
further
to
the
north
on
the
west
side
at
which
time
he
would
then
cross
over
to
the
east
side
to
do
his
further
work.
i
mentioned
that
because
in
addition
to
the
job
of
burning
the
weeds,
he
was
a
section
man
and
the
defendant
through
its
foreman
imposed
on
him
and
the
others
the
duty
of
watching
for
the
trains
whenever
they
went
by
for
hotboxes.
apparently,
that
was
a
paramount
consideration
because
the
foreman
told
him
that
--
and
told
all
of
them,
“when
a
train
goes
by,
drop
everything.
put
down
everything
and
watch
the
train
for
hotboxes.”
and
the
foreman
went
further
and
said
that
the
crew
should
divide
their
works
so
that
some
would
be
on
the
east
side
and
some
on
the
west
side
so
that
necessarily,
they
can
watch
as
the
train
went
by
the
hotboxes
on
the
west
side,
which
would
be
equally
important
with
the
hotboxes
if
any
on
the
east
side.
it
so
happens
and
the
record
show
this
fact
that
at
the
time
of
plaintiff's
injury,
the
petitioner's
injury
he
alone
was
on
the
east
side.
every
other
member
of
the
crew
was
on
the
--
he
alone
was
on
the
west
side,
i
beg
your
pardon.
every
other
member
of
the
crew
was
on
the
east
side
so
that
--
and
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
assigning
those
other
men
to
that
position.
he
was
merely
assigned
to
do
this
work
himself,
but
he
was
explicitly
told
to
watch
that
train
for
hotboxes.
so,
he
goes
along
with
his
torch
and
he
sets
fire
to
the
weeds
on
the
west
side
and
was
told
to
stand
on
the
west
shoulder,
to
stay
along
the
west
shoulder.
he
was
told
not
to
cross
or
attempt
to
cross
to
the
east
in
front
of
the
oncoming
train
which
of
course
would
be
hazardous
in
and
of
itself.
but
he
was
particularly
advised
not
to
cross
because
the
--
the
noise
of
the
oncoming
train
would
deafen
the
sound
of
another
oncoming
train,
if
one
would
come
from
the
opposite
direction,
so
that
he
couldn't
cross
to
the
east.
he
couldn't
cross
to
the
west
because
that's
where
he
was
burning.
he
was
burning
to
the
left
of
it
and
the
west
on
the
shoulder
and
the
--
down
into
to
the
dump.
he
couldn't
go
back
to
the
south.
that's
the
direction
he
was
working
from,
from
south
to
north.
the
only
avenue
of
escape
from
the
fire
once
it
was
started
would
be
to
the
north.
and
so,
he
goes
along
with
his
work
and
the
understanding
was
that
when
a
train
was
coming
before
a
gap
to
the
crossing,
the
foreman
would
yell
“train”
and
would
usually
yell
in
the
south
bound
or
north
bound.
but
in
this
particular
instance,
it
is
not
of
great
significance,
but
it
is
in
--
a
fact
nevertheless,
that
the
foreman
did
not
yell
“train!”
he
didn't
give
the
customary
notice.
it
would
only
be
important
in
showing
how
the
time
was
consumed.
he
didn't
give
him
that
notice.
and
the
first
that
the
petitioner
knew
that
a
train
was
coming
was
when
he
heard
the
whistle
at
the
crossing,
some
200
yards
away
from
him.
mindful
of
the
admonition
that
had
theretofore
been
given
him
to
watch
the
train,
he
started
running
away
from
the
fire
which
had
been
set
to
the
north
and
he
ran
as
far
as
the
culvert,
which
was
30
to
35
yards
from
the
point
where
he
was
last
working
when
he
heard
the
train.
when
he
gets
to
the
culvert,
by
that
time,
the
train
has
overtaken
him
and
the
engine
has
already
passed
him
by.
now,
the
engine
is
on
the
north
bound
track
so
that
its
engine
on
the
--
because
its
pulling
on
the
north
bound
track.
it
is
15
to
20
feet
east
of
it.
he
sets
his
torch
down
at
that
point,
turns
to
the
east
so
it's
the
--
watched
the
hotboxes
and
when
three
or
four
cars
going
at
the
rate
of
35
to
40
--
30
to
35
miles
an
hour,
which
would
be
at
the
rate
mathematically
of
51
to
59
feet
a
second.
that's
purely
mathematics.
in
that
51
to
59
feet,
it's
like
three
cars
go
by
him.
and
by
that
time,
he
feels
the
heat
of
the
blaze
on
his
face.
as
he
carries
his
hip,
it
seems
his
eyebrows
are
seamed.
he
throws
his
left
hand
over
his
eyes
and
quickly
backs
up
six
or
eight
feet.
and
when
he
backs
up
at
least
six
or
eight
feet,
he
has
caused
to
fall
down
the
embankment
and
suffers
injury
because
that
particular
portion
of
the
culvert
onto
which
he
backed
was
sloping
and
had
loose
gravel
on
it
which
he
says
was
never
permitted
ordinarily
to
be
there.
that
was
kept
flat
and
leveled
so
that
such
a
man
would
have
a
safe
place
to
walk.
now,
he
didn't
know
the
sloping
gravel
was
there,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
because
when
he
--
the
only
time
he
was
ever
up
at
that
culvert.
this
was
the
first
day
he
had
ever
done
that
job
in
his
life.
it
was
the
first
time
he'd
ever
seen
it
done.
he'd
only
had
this
torch
complete
the
total
of
30
to
35
minutes
according
to
the
record.
he
runs
out
there
immediately
apply
his
attention
to
the
east
to
watch
this
thing
that
only
takes
two
to
three
seconds
for
three
cars
to
go
by.
he
feels
the
blaze,
backs
away,
then
down
he
goes.
now,
--
mr.
mark
d.
eagleton
no,
from
the
--
mr.
mark
d.
eagleton
no,
from
the
fire
of
the
weeds.
mr.
mark
d.
eagleton
the
wind.
what
happened
was
that
the
train
and
the
evidence
shows,
the
train
caused
the
north
air
disturbance
to
firm
up
the
blaze
and
back
upping
to
the
south
and
to
cause
it
to
envelop
him
and
to
come
up
on
top
of
it.
now,
he
was
asked
by
counsel,
“didn't
you
know
that
the
train
passing
would
cause
wind?”
and
he
said
well
he
thought
it
would
cause
wind
in
the
direction
it
was
going,
which
was
to
the
north,
but
he
did
not
know
that
it
would
cause
the
blaze
to
come
over
the
wind,
to
come
over
far
enough
to
involve
the
blaze
to
the
west.
in
other
words,
at
15
feet
or
20
feet,
he
was
standing
on
the
shoulder,
there
was
a
track
intervening
a
southbound
track
between.
so
that
we
say
that
--
that
under
the
evidence,
the
very,
very
simple
facts
that
these
facts
are
--
are
practically
without
dispute,
the
form
and
everything
i
could
--
any
part
of
this.
it
was
referenced
to
telling
the
man
where
he
had
to
stand,
said,
stand
on
the
west
shoulder.
that's
where
he
stood.
the
foreman
never
said,
“i
didn't
tell
him
to
stand
there.
no
other
witness
said
he
shouldn't
have
stood
there.
no
other
witness
said
that
he
did
a
single
thing
that
wasn't
right
to
do.
he
did
exactly
what
he
was
told
to
do.
in
fact,
if
you
examine
the
facts,
you'll
wonder
what
else
he
could
have
done.
having
in
mind
that
there
was
a
duty
imposed
on
him
to
watch
this
train,”
and
the
foreman
never
says,
“he
wasn't
supposed
to
watch
the
train,
that
he
could
avoid
that.”
although,
counsel
suggested
that
he
might
well
ignored
the
train
and
has
he
ignored
the
train
which
he
was
trying
to
do,
he's
trying
to
do
his
job
which
the
foreman
told
him
to
do
and
which
the
foreman
doesn't
deny.
he's
trying
to
do
his
job,
but
the
counsel
said
that
he
ignored
the
train
and
watched
the
fire,
he
wouldn't
have
burned.
that
isn't
even
true.
he
could've
ignored
that
train
and
he
just
stood
there
and
watched
the
fire,
just
look
at
it.
he
was
burned
back
to
the
face,
turned
himself
up
and
then
looked
and
watched
that
fire.
it
would
have
burned
with
him
watching
it
just
as
much
as
would
if
he
was
not
watching
it.
the
train
had
caused
the
air
disturbance
with
just
as
much
and
envelop
that
he
just
stood
there.
the
only
difference
is,
either
burn
to
death
while
standing
there
and
watching
it.
there
wasn't
anything
he
could
do.
he
had
no
magic.
he
had
no
wand.
he
just
couldn't
say,
“out!”
he
was
there,
had
to
stand
and
watch
that
fire
would
only
then
to
watch
it
burn.
and
yet
the
state
court
said
that
he
was
--
didn't
have
a
submissible
case
because
he
didn't
attend
the
fire.
these
two
or
three
seconds,
he
was
watching
the
train.
he
couldn't
do
both
at
the
same
time,
and
they
gave
him
no
means
of
escape.
they
say
that
this
culvert
which
was
normally
suppose
to
be
kept
free
and
clear
of
gravel
and
which
was
not
supposed
to
be
sloping
down.
they
say,
“normally,
it
would
be
all
right
for
the
average
section
man
to
walk
across
it
if
he
was
walking
across
with
this
--
facing
the
direction
he's
going.
he
could
walk
across
it
readily
and
easily,
to
grab
at
that.
he
could,
normally.”
and
they
say,
“he
was
negligent,”
they
say
in
their
answer
in
backing
up
that
he
shouldn't
have
backed
up.
he
shouldn't
have
made
these
missteps.
he
should've
watched
where
he
was
going.
that
to
me
seems
somewhat
utterly
ridiculous
to
say
that
you
first
give
a
man
a
job
to
do.
tell
him
expressly
where
to
stand,
tell
him
what
to
do
then
send
your
train
along.
he
didn't
cause
this
disturbance.
it
did.
the
defendant
did.
and
then,
when
he
was
about
to
catch
on
fire
his
hair,
his
eyes,
his
eyebrows
have
already
caught
on
fire,
to
say
that
when
he
protects
himself
by
throwing
his
hand
over
his
eyes,
we're
happier
now.
he's
negligent
by
backing
up
instead
of
walking
away.
you
ought
to
get
caught
on
fire
on
the
rear
end
instead
of
the
front
end.
well,
to
me,
that
is
--
is
utterly
ridiculous
and
it's
in
the
face
of
your
honors'
decisions
and
many
of
them.
i'll
take
no
further
time
after
the
counsel
is
finished.
mr.
mark
d.
eagleton
may
it
please
your
--
the
court.
of
necessity
in
any
pleading,
i
suppose
in
any
state,
you
don't
plead
all
of
the
evidence.
if
you
did,
you
would
have
to
come
in
with
a
transcript
of
evidence
rather
than
a
pleading.
we
usually
come
out
with
a
longer
one
that
we
go
in
with.
what
you
plead
is
ultimate
facts
and
the
facts
are
simply
set
forth
in
our
petition
filed
in
the
circuit
court.
we
haven't
changed
a
single
fact,
a
single
theory,
a
single
position
and
don't
intend
to.
but
mr.
sommers,
when
mr.
chief
justice
warren
asked
him
to
--
what
this
--
what
did
the
pleading
say,
he
started
reading
at
the
tail
end
of
paragraph
5
instead
at
the
beginning.
and
i'm
going
to
ask
your
honor's
indulgence
because
i'm
not
going
to
use
the
full
time
anyway.
i
don't
think
that
it's
all
necessary
here.
he
--
he
overlooked
the
fact.
mr.
chief
justice
said,
“do
you
make
a
distinction
between
being
compelled
to
watch
these
cars
for
hotboxes
are
being
required?”
he
said,
“no.”
but
then,
when
he
went
to
read
the
pleading,
he
overlooked
the
allegation
about
being
required.
on
page
2
of
the
record,
the
pleading
says
that
the
defendant
was
engaged
in
burning
weeds
using
a
hand
torch
along
defendant's
right
of
way
near
garner.
in
so
doing,
he
was
required,
the
petitioner
was
required
to
work
at
a
place
in
close
proximity
to
defendant's
tracks
whereon
trains
moved
and
passed
causing
the
fire
from
said
burning
weeds
and
the
smoke
there
from
become
dangerously
close
to
the
plaintiff
and
requiring
plaintiff
to
move
away
from
said
danger.
that
on
the
occasion
herein
mentioned
a
train
did
pass
and
did
cause
plaintiff
to
fast
retreat
and
move
quickly
from
the
place
where
he
was
then
working
and
he
uses
his
place
of
work
on
the
right
of
way
adjoining
a
culvert
covered
with
slope,
loose
and
sloping
gravel
which
did
not
provide
adequate
or
sufficient
footing.
all
we've
done
is
plead
the
facts.
mr.
justice
douglas
in
the
bailey
case
said,
“that's
all
you
plead.
that's
all
you
submit.
that's
for
the
jury
to
appraise
and
consider.
you
can't
plead
it
anymore
succinctly
or
chronologically
than
that.”
that's
exactly
what
he
said
happened.
“i
was
required
to
stare
within
close
and
dangerous
proximity
to
those
tracks
at
a
time
you
were
running
a
train
on
it
and
at
a
time
when
you
had
at
least
set
a
fire
with
this
torch
as
you
caused
by
your
train
and
your
wind
the
fire
to
envelop
me,
so
i
have
to
move
quickly
away
or
be
burned
to
death.”
and
he
said,
“that
isn't
enough.”
no
jury
could
find
the
defendant
was
negligent
under
those
circumstances.
he
said
that
it
defies
the
rule
of
foreseeability.
where
was
the
petitioner
to
go?
there's
no
mystery
about
this
thing.
he
couldn't
go
south.
he'd
go
into
the
fire.
he
couldn't
cross
east.
he'll
be
crossing
the
tracks
when
they
told
him
not
to.
he
couldn't
go
west.
that's
where
they
were
burning
the
weeds.
he
could
only
go
north.
that's
the
direction
he
did
go,
30
or
35
yards
north.
and
then,
what
--
why
did
he
stop
there?
because
they
had
imposed
on
him
his
duty
to
watch
these
hotboxes,
and
he
said
that
he
was
standing
there
voluntarily,
these
two
seconds.
that's
all
he
stood,
two
to
three
seconds.
he
said
he's
standing
there
voluntarily.
well,
is
that
voluntarily
when
you're
standing
there
in
expressed
compliance
with
a
command?
in
the
record,
let's
see
how
that
record
recites
that
matter
and
it
won't
--
it
disposes
of
this
thing
so
clearly
that
i
think
that
it's
worth
reading.
did
you
receive
--
page
12,
“did
you
receive
any
instructions
from
mr.
howdershell,
your
foreman
as
to
what
you
should
do
at
all
times
while
a
section
man
was
referenced
to
trains
go
by?”
“yes,
sir.”
“as
to
what
your
duties
were,
as
--
as
to
what
duties
you
were
to
perform,
what
were
you
told
by
him?”
answer
-
“he
told
us
to
put
down
everything
we
were
doing.
get
clear
of
what
we
were
doing
and
stand
and
watch
the
trains
go
by
for
hotboxes.”
and
continuing
just
a
short,
“and
you
always
done
that
--
had
you
always
done
that
during
the
time
you
worked
there
as
section
man?”
“yes.”
“were
you
told
by
him
anything
with
reference
to
standing
on
the
opposite
track,
opposite
track
and
doing
it?”
he
said
at
all
times
he
wanted
some
men
on
the
one
side
of
the
track
and
some
on
the
other
and
this
petitioner
was
the
only
one,
the
only
one
that
was
left
to
perform
that
duty
on
the
west
side.
there
wasn't
anybody
else
there.
the
record
shows
that.
now,
at
page
29,
counsel
was
cross-examining
about
his
statement
made
in
direct
examination
and
the
petitioner
repeated
this
question
by
mr.
sommers.
“you
say
he
said
you
should
drop
everything
you
are
doing
and
watch
for
hotboxes?”
answer
-
“yes.
he
said
when
a
train
is
passing
to
not
be
working,
be
watching
the
train.”
and
then
when
he
gets
over
to
page
30,
the
next
page,
as
you
knew,
mr.
sommers
is
still
cross-examining,
“as
you
knew
on
that
day
it
was
your
duty
to
watch
that
fire.
"yes,
sir."
we
don't
say
that
he
--
whether
supposed
to
watch
the
fire
as
best
he
could
while
he
was
still
trying
to
watch
the
train
if
he
could.
they
were
conflicting.
i'll
read
that
question
and
answer
again
here.
“that
you
knew
on
that
day
it
was
your
duty
to
watch
that
fire.”
answer
-
“yes,
sir."
and
that
was
the
first
duty
regardless
of
the
train.
and
now,
his
answer,
“he
told
us
to
watch
the
train
when
it
came
by.”
those
were
his
explicit
instructions
and
mr.
sommers
is
trying
to
say,
“why
didn't
you
go
some
other
direction?”
on
page
28,
he
says,
“why
didn't
you
get
behind
your
fire
so
the
wind
would
pull
it
away
from
you?”
and
he
answers,
“i
would
have
been
standing
in
the
fire.
there
was
fire
on
the
shoulder,
all
south
of
me.”
he
couldn't
get
any
place
by
watching.
he
--
he
went
as
far
as
he
could
to
get
away
from
the
hazardous
position
they
placed
him
in.
now,
on
page
12
of
the
respondent's
brief,
he
said
this
petitioner
was
getting
along
performing
his
work
with
ease
until
he
saw
fit
to
leave
his
fire
and
stand
next
to
the
culvert.
he
didn't
see
fit
to
do
anything.
he
was
told
to
do
it.
he
wasn't
voluntarily
doing
anything
but
following
instructions,
and
no
witness
took
the
stand,
howdershell
and
no
one
else
took
the
stand
and
said,
“i
did
not
give
those
instructions
or
i
did
not
expect
them
to
follow
them
in
that
manner.”
the
only
thing
you
talk
about
a
change
in
position,
the
only
thing
that
was
changed
was
the
defendant's
position,
respondent
here.
in
the
answer
in
his
--
in
the
lower
court,
he
never
once
said
the
plaintiff
was
doing
something
he
shouldn't
be
doing.
standing
some
place
he
shouldn't
be
standing.
he
simply
said
he
failed
to
watch
where
he
was
going,
either
ahead
or
laterally.
he
failed
to
maintain
secure
footing.
he
walked
backwards
of
course
when
he
was
in
peril
and
he
made
a
misstep.
he
never
once
submitted
to
the
jury
the
fact
that
he
left
his
fire
unattended
or
that
he
was
wrong
in
leaving
it
unattended.
no
jury
would
say
that
he
was
wrong
in
leaving
the
fire
for
two
seconds
to
perform
a
task
that
was
made
imperative
by
the
defendant,
the
respondent
here.
and
under
those
circumstances
to
say
that
you
needed
a
crystal
ball
to
say
that
this
man
was
going
to
be
injured
or
even
burn
to
death.
there's
no
place
for
him
to
go
except
what
he
did
do.
and
i
don't
think
when
you
say
that
you're
trying
to
have
the
case
considered
as
a
whole,
all
of
the
facts
that
were
alleged
that
you
have
to
come
up
with
an
argument
that
you
ought
to
say,
you
were
saying
you're
trying
to
tie
--
tie
an
oil
pin
on
mrs.
o'leary's
cow.
what
we're
trying
to
show
is
that
things
in
a
pattern
in
relation
to
each
other
must
all
be
considered,
what
he
was
doing,
why
he
was
looking
at
this
train,
why
he
kept
his
eyes
away
for
two
seconds
or
three
seconds.
and
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan,
mr.
sommers
said
--
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
him
i
believe,
“was
there
anything
in
the
evidence
to
show
that
this
culvert
was
any
different
than
any
other
culvert?”
and
mr.
sommers
said,
“no,
i
don't
think
that's
effective.
i've
got
just
a
few
little
excerpts,”
and
not
that
i
think
that
the
culvert
itself
was
already
part
of
it.
the
loose
gravel
was
only
part
of
it.
this
fellow
was
doomed
to
be
burned.
i'd
say
with
or
without
the
loose
gravel.
the
only
thing
the
loose
gravel
did
was
to
make
certain
of
it.
he
was
due
to
get
hurt.
he'd
either
get
burned
to
death
on
it
and
when
he
fell
with
the
loose
gravel,
his
back
was
injured
instead.
now,
here's
the
parts
about
that
matter
on
page
14.
at
the
bottom,
“are
culverts
a
very
frequent
and
necessarily
and
plentiful
thing
around
railroads?
you
saw
a
lot
of
them.”
answer
-
“yes.”
“in
section
work?
i
will
ask
you.
“what
is
the
fact
normally?
do
they
have
a
flat
surface
upon
which
to
walk
across
a
culvert?”
answer
-
“yes,
sir,
they
do.”
“did
this
one
had
one
or
was
it
one
that
was
there
buried
and
covered
up.”
answer
-
“apparently,
it
had
one,
but
they
had
neglected
it
and
the
vibration
from
the
train
had
shaken
it
down,
and
then
there
was
an
objection.
the
answer
wasn't
scripted.
then
i
went
on
with
this.
“i
don't
want
you
to
assume
anything.
when
you
stepped
on
that
portion
of
it,
what
was
the
effect
that
it
had
on
your
feet
on
that
portion
of
the
culvert
where
normally
it
is
flat?”
answer
-
“nothing,
but
crushed
rock.
no
flat
surface.
it
rolled
out
from
under
me.”
now,
in
--
in
continuing
in
that
same
--
mr.
mark
d.
eagleton
about
the
culvert
again,
“is
there
a
path
normally
provided
across
the
culvert
right
contiguous
with
the
path?”
that's
the
path
he
was
coming
up
to
the
culvert.
“yes.”
“how
wide
is
the
path
across
the
culvert,
approximately
the
same
width,
two
and
a
half
or
three
feet
wide?”
“and
did
you
see
that
path
on
the
culvert
so
as
you
went
north
to
get
away
from
the
fire?”
“on
the
day,
what
was
it
covered
with?”
answer
-
“loose
rock,
crushed
gravel.”
“what
were
the
instructions
to
the
section
gang
with
reference
to
permitting
or
allowing
loose
rocks
to
be
on
that
path
across
the
culvert?”
answer
-
“when
there's
loose
rocks,
anytime
we
take
out
a
tire
or
anything
and
move
the
rocks
from
the
incline,
he
would
have
us
to
clean
it
out
and
put
them
back
where
they
were
so
the
men
would
have
a
safe
place
to
walk.”
no
denial
of
it
by
howdershell.
it's
just
something
--
something
that
shouldn't
have
been
there,
but
the
real
cause
of
this
thing,
the
whole
picture
is
making
him
work
where
they
told
him
to
stand
on
the
west
shoulder
of
the
road
and
they
--
they
--
even
the
place
where
they
told
him
to
stand.
it's
here
on
page
12.
you
were
told
to
stand
at
all
times
on
the
west
shoulder
of
the
road.
mr.
mark
d.
eagleton
well,
i'll
repeat.
i
read
that
to
the
court
before.
now,
i
think
--
i
think
under
the
circumstances
that
the
court
in
practically
convicting
this
petitioner's
negligence
as
a
matter
of
law
and
say
that
he
solely
was
to
blame
and
that
the
respondent
who
had
told
him
what
to
do
which
he
followed
where
to
stand
which
he
followed,
when
this
train
going
35
to
40
miles
an
hour
and
with
a
wind
disturbance
and
then
imperative
that
it
was
not
to
blame
at
all
and
that
no
jury
could
so
apply.
i
don't
believe
that's
the
law.
and
one
thing
about
the
survey
of
this
culvert,
he
didn't
have
any
chance
when
he
went
up
to
look,
running
up
to
this
culvert.
he
didn't
have
any
chance
to
look
at
it.
then,
his
time
was
taken
right
when
he
got
there
to
look
at
this
train.
it
says,
“how
long
was
it
that
you
were
in
that
position
before
you
felt
the
flame
or
the
burning
process?
how
many
cars
had
gone
by?”
“approximately,
three
or
four.”
“about
how
fast
would
you
say
the
train
was
moving?”
“i
would
say
35
to
40
miles
an
hour.”
“had
you
when
you
went
up
there
made
any
survey
of
the
situation
that
was
not
there
or
the
culvert
at
that
time?”
“no
sir,
i
didn't.”
he
wouldn't
have
any
occasion,
so
he
runs
as
fast
as
he
could.
he
turns
to
watch
the
--
the
things.
the
next
thing
in
a
second
or
two
is
invalid.
he
makes
an
effort
to
escape
by
backing
six
or
eight
feet.
the
loose
gravel
throws
him
and
he's
injured.
mr.
buckley
says
i
misread
a
word
here
and
i
don't
want
to
do
that
in
--
on
page
33.
he
said
i
used
the
word
“see”
instead
of
“use”.
“did
you
use
that
path
on
the
culvert
as
you
went
north
to
get
away
from
the
fire?”
answer
-
“yes,
sir.”
that's
the
same
one
of
the
loose
gravel.
i
thank
you.
