chief

earl
warren
(voice

with
instructions?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
--
did
the
foreman
deny
having
given
--
giving
him
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
orders
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
any
question
about
this
that
his
primary
duty
was
to
tend
the
fire?
was
it
his
secondary
duty
to
watch
for
--
for
hotboxes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
had
to
--
as
i
understand
though,
he
had
to
make
that
decision
between
the
fire
which
was
blowing
into
his
face
and
the
train
going
35
miles
an
hour
by
him,
he
being
on
a
--
on
a
very
narrow
plateau
there
that
--
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
there
a
difference
between
that
--
that
situation
that
you've
just
stated
in
his
position?
as
i
understand
it,
when
you
were
a
boy
and
--
and
cleaning
the
--
burning
the
leaves
in
the
gutter,
they
didn't
also
give
you
instructions
to
watch
those
cars
for
hotboxes
or
bad
breaks,
and
you
were
perfectly
free
to
move
in
one
direction.
here,
as
i
understood
the
counsel,
i
maybe
mistaken
but
as
i
understood
him,
this
man
was
on
a
narrow
ledge
of
soft
material
that
could
break
down
at
anytime
and
he
was
given
instructions,
both
to
watch
for
the
fire
in
one
direction
and
also
watch
for
hotboxes
in
another
direction.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
isn't
that
different
from
your
situation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
would
you
put
me
right
on
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
that
loose?
isn't
that
loose
material?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
mean
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
gravel
--
the
gravel
and
the
crest
rocks
that
you
put
in
between
the
ties
and
the
rails
and
along
the
shoulders,
isn't
that
loose
material?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
so.
chief
justice
earl
warren
comes
up
to
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
some
of
it
was
what
he
claims
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
you
--
before
you
get
off
to
that.
isn't
it
one
thing
for
that
to
be
that
area
to
be
safe
under
normal
conditions?
isn't
it
another
thing,
another
question
as
to
whether
it's
safe
for
a
man
has
a
fire
on
one
side
of
him
and
a
train
moving
35
miles
an
hour
on
the
other
side
of
him
and
the
wind
caused
by
the
train
flowing
in
to
his
face
and
singeing
his
eyebrows
and
he
with
--
with
orders
to
watch
both
the
fire
and
the
train
for
fireboxes,
is
--
isn't
there
a
little
difference
in
those
two
situations?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
my
point
is
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sommers,
the
thing
--
the
thing
that
bothers
me
and
that
i
would
like
to
--
you'd
add
in
this
--
in
this
case
is
this.
your
--
your
right
of
way
may
--
may
have
been
properly
constructed
for
the
--
for
the
passage
of
--
of
trains
and
also,
the
--
the
burning
of
the
weeds
program
that
you
have
might
--
might
be
entirely
proper.
if
there
were
no
trains
coming
along
at
the
same
time,
but
if
you
try
to
make
it
--
put
a
--
have
a
combination
of
the
two,
the
burning
of
the
weeds
while
there
--
while
there
are
trains
going
by
and
you
--
you
put
a
man
in
that
dangerous
position
and
instruct
him
that
he
so
not
only
have
one
duty,
the
duty
of
watching
after
his
fire
and
protecting
his
own
life.
but
you
give
him
--
give
him
another
duty
and
tell
him
that
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
is
watching
that
fire,
he
must
also
watch
the
passing
train
for
hotboxes
and
then
you
leave
him
in
this
narrow
position
where
your
footing
--
footing
is
not
secure
and
have
a
train
passing
35
miles
an
hour
by
him
and
he
does
some
act
that
you
think
under
normal
circumstances
might
be
a
negligent
act,
is
he
accountable
for
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
such
times
--
as
such
times
as
that
and
should
not
the
employer
have
those
things
in
mind
when
he
instructs
the
employee
to
both,
to
watch
his
fire
from
this
precarious
position
and
watch
for
hotboxes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
isn't
that
for
the
jury
to
determine.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
a
--
is
that
a
matter
of
law.
isn't
that
for
the
jury
to
determine?
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
they
plea
negligence
of
--
of
the
company
and
in
terms
that
were
broad
enough
to
encompass
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
court
decide
it
on
the
question
of
pleading
--
lack
of
pleadings?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
make
a
--
a
distinction
between
being
compelled
to
do
it
and
being
instructed
by
his
foreman
to
do
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
make
a
distinction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
the
pleading
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
--
is
the
pleading
broad
enough
to
cover
that
kind
of
negligence
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
regardless
of
whether
it
was
specifically
urged
or
a
specific
instruction
was
asked
on
that
--
on
that
score?
was
the
negligent
--
what
was
the
language
in
the
pleading
so
far
as
negligence
of
the
employer
was
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
doesn't
that
raise
--
doesn't
that
raise
a
question?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
don't
suppose
you'd
have
to
put
all
of
the
--
the
evidence
in
would
you,
but
doesn't
raised
the
--
the
issue
as
to
whether
they
were
negligent
in
--
in
--
in
the
facts
of
the
case
as
he
relates
in
there
on
this
alleged,
the
train
go
and
by
and
he's
required
to
do
certain
things.
isn't
that
not
enough
to
raise
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
did
he
--
in
this
--
in
the
testimony,
did
he
not
say
that
the
foreman
had
--
had
given
him
instructions
to
--
to
watch
the
train
for
hotboxes
at
the
same
time
he's
to
be
watching
his
fire?
did
he
not
so
testify?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
mean
in
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
substance.
that's
what
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
understood
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
didn't
he
say
that
was
an
instruction
from
his
foreman
to
do
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
and
didn't
he
also
testify
that
--
that
this
was
a
narrow
ledge
and
had
a
poor
--
a
poor
footing
for
--
in
such
circumstances?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
and
--
and
he
endeavored
to
--
to
show
the
loose
condition
of
that
footing,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then,
then
he
showed
that
there
was
a
train
coming
35
miles
an
hour.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
he
showed
that
the
fire
was
so
close
that
--
that
it
burned
him.
when
the
--
when
the
wind
came
along,
it
--
it
burned
him
and
he
--
he
had
to
move.
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
it
would.
have
you
ever
had
your
eyebrows
singed
in
a
situation
like
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i
think
the
man
had
moved
pretty
fast,
wouldn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
and
i
wondered
if
he'd
ever
stood
along
side
of
a
railroad
train
going
35
miles
an
hour
within
a
foot
or
two
of
it
on
a
loose
footing
and
had
any
duties
to
perform.
chief
justice
earl
warren
pretty
dangerous
thing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
--
isn't
that
the
condition
this
man
was
talking
about
and
isn't
that
a
--
isn't
that
a
question
for
the
jury
to
determine
whether
those
condition,
putting
a
man
in
--
in
those
situations
did
constitute
negligence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
evidence
indicates
to
support
it,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
sommers.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sommers,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
eagleton.
