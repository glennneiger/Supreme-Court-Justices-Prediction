mr.
donald
b.
sommers
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
the
factual
situation
can
be
limited
to
about
six
different
events.
first
of
all,
the
petitioner
was
given
a
task
to
perform,
a
several
task
of
firing
those
weeds
and
only
those
weeds
which
had
been
affected
by
a
chemical
weed
killer
and
had
dried.
he
testified
that
they
were
--
that
he
had
a
place
about
three
feet
wide
to
walk
at
where
there
was
no
fire
on
the
--
on
this
next
to
the
track.
that
it
was
his
job
to
set
this
torch
to
those
weeds
which
had
apparently
some
of
--
hadn't
been
killed
and
others
have.
and
in
his
own
words,
he
burned
just
spots
of
weeds
of
a
distance
of
about
two
and
a
half
to
three
or
three
feet
to
his
left.
in
other
words,
he
just
set
his
torch
out
there
as
he
walked
along.
he
testified
he
got
along
all
right
with
the
job.
the
next
thing
that
happened
was
that
he
heard
the
train
coming
and
blow
the
whistle
crossing
south
of
garner
crossing.
ordinarily,
the
foreman
calls
the
train,
but
the
foreman
was
about
400
yards
off
the
road
putting
in
ties
with
the
rest
of
them.
that
train
caused
him
no
surprise
and
he
said
so.
when
he
heard
the
train
however,
he
quit
his
firing,
in
his
own
words,
he
quit
firing.
left
his
work
and
ran
to
the
culvert
which
he
knew
was
there,
which
he
saw
it
was
an
open
and
obvious
culvert
and
stood
right
next
to
it.
stood
there
while
the
train
in
his
own
words
went
--
was
until
--
the
train
was
about
a
half
or
two-thirds
of
the
way
by.
during
this
time,
he
watched
the
train
for
hotboxes.
then
he
felt
--
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
well,
if
the
court
please,
the
petitioner
did
say
the
reason
he
went
up
there
to
watch
this
train
for
hotboxes
was
because
of
a
previous
general
order
of
the
foreman
to
watch
trains
for
hotboxes.
however,
he
was
examined
on
that
point
and
he
said,
affirmative
to
them,
that
he
knew
his
job
on
that
day
was
to
watch
and
tend
the
fire.
he
knew
his
primary
duty
was
to
watch
and
tend
that
fire.
he
did
not
construe
the
foreman's
orders
to
mean
that
he
should
ignore
the
fire.
now,
those
were
his
own
words.
now,
--
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
oh,
no.
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
that's
true.
it's
a
general
order.
all
section
crews,
when
a
train
goes
by.
they
used
to
get
off.
they
can't
work
on
the
tracks
when
a
train
goes
by,
so
they
get
off
and
if
they
--
they
look
at
that
train
as
it
goes
by
for
journals.
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
i
presume,
sir,
if
--
it
is
fairly
inferred
from
this
record
that
if
the
fellow
could
watch
the
hotboxes
without
losing
control
of
his
fire,
it
could
--
he
wasn't
--
he
was
to
do
so.
he
said
by
his
own
words,
he
did
not
construe
the
foreman's
orders
to
mean
that
he
should
ignore
his
fire
however.
and
--
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
i
think
that
the
--
the
problem
of
whether
or
not
he
watched
the
trains
for
hotboxes
is
not
so
important,
as
the
fact
that
he
in
so
doing
ignored
the
fire
or
was
he
had
been
put
out
there
to
tend.
now,
we
don't
claim
as
petitioner
says
in
his
brief
that
he
was
negligent
in
watching
his
hot
--
by
then
watching
the
train
for
hotboxes.
we
don't
claim
that
he
himself
was
negligent.
the
fact
that
he
did
so,
certainly,
doesn't
--
and
did
so
to
the
--
in
such
a
manner
as
that
he
would
not
know
where
his
fire
was
burning
is
what
is
important
in
the
case.
the
fact
is
that
he
was
sent
out
here
and
--
and
i'm
reminded
of
--
of
the
times
when
i
was
a
young
boy
in
st.
joseph,
missouri,
and
we
break
the
leaves
out
into
the
gutter
of
the
street
in
the
fall
of
the
year
and
set
fire
to
them
along
the
gutter
of
the
street,
and
cars
would
go
by
and
fan
those
weeds
from
time
to
time,
and
we'd
stand
out
there
with
a
rake
and
scoop
them
up
into
piles.
now,
certainly,
that
if
--
we
know
that
as
this
fellow
did
that
the
passing
vehicles
are
going
to
cause
some
--
some
impetus
to
the
fire,
but
we
can't
say
--
say
it
because
we
watched
cars
go
by,
that
that's
the
reason
why
we
ignored
the
fire
which
we
had
set
and
which
we
knew
was
there
and
there
was
no
one
else
and
that
he
doesn't
claim
someone
else
should've
told
him
or
advised
him
that
this
fire
which
he
had
set
was
approaching
him.
all
he
had
to
do
was
look
and
see,
and
that
is
what
the
situation
is
so
far
as
the
missouri
court's
opinion
is
concerned
here.
they
merely
found
by
the
own
--
fellow's
own
evidence
in
the
case
and
there
was
no
conflict
in
the
evidence
in
the
case.
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
no,
no.
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
no
--
i'm
--
it's
not
to
my
understanding
of
the
case
but
perhaps
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
this
dump
as
i
understand
the
railroad
lingo
to
be
is
the
build
up
embankment,
the
roadbed.
i
--
that's
what
i
call
a
dump
and
i
think
that's
what
the
section
men
call
a
dump.
on
top
of
the
dump,
it's
flat
on
top
supposedly
and
slants
at
the
sides.
on
top
of
the
dump,
there's
nothing
infirm
about
the
dump
by
the
way,
mr.
chief
justice.
there's
nothing
infirm
about
the
place
where
the
fellow
was
walking.
on
top
of
the
dump
is
placed
a
ballast
which
holds
the
ties
and
tracks
in
place.
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
and
it
is
simple
as
that.
now,
this
fellow
--
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
well,
no.
here's
the
situation
here.
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
between
--
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
but
you
see,
at
the
testimony
that's
here,
there
was
an
area
of
about
six
feet
from
the
end
of
the
ties
up
of
to
the
crest
of
the
dump.
some
of
it
was
occupied
by
the
ballast
and
the
other
he
says
was
a
flat
loose
or
a
flat
dirt
surface,
you
see.
now,
he
comes
up
to
this
culvert.
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
to
the
culvert,
where
he
stood,
which
he
could
see
was
open
and
obvious.
and
at
the
culvert
he
says,
he
does
and
there's
no
claim
in
this
case
that
the
culvert
was
improperly
constructed
or
maintained.
all
that
he
says
about
the
culvert
was
this,
and
he
--
said
--
gives
two
different
versions
on
the
thing.
he
says
two
or
three
different
places,
pages
24,
30
and
31
of
the
record,
that
when
he
threw
his
arm
over
his
eyes,
he
backed
up
on
the
ballast
which
was
properly
placed
as
to
hold
the
ties
and
rails.
at
best,
the
petitioner's
evidence
in
this
case
can
only
go
to
show
that
some
of
it
had
shaken
down
over
what
was
otherwise
are
flat
dirt
surfaces,
you
see.
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
that's
what
he
test
--
that's
what
--
taking
the
--
the
evidence
most
favorable
to
petitioner
as
the
missouri
supreme
court
did.
now,
the
question
then
becomes
as
to
whether
or
not
that
condition
or
there
was
evidence
sufficient
in
the
record
to
create
or
to
raise
a
question
of
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
respondent
in
that
condition.
first
of
all,
the
missouri
court
held
and
i
think
it
is
properly
so
from
the
state
of
the
record
in
the
case
that
there
would
be
record
--
i
mean,
the
condition
was
not
shown
to
have
been
dangerous
merely
because
that
there
were
some
gravel
out
there.
the
petitioner
did
not
claim
and
it
is
submitted
here
that
for
the
normal
foreseeable
use
of
that
culvert,
even
assuming
as
petitioner
claims
it
was
to
be
used
as
a
walkway.
it
can
only
be
reasonably
foreseen
that
it
was
going
to
be
used
as
a
walkway.
a
person
could
walk
across
it
at
least
--
with
his
eyes
open.
and
there's
not
one
word
of
evidence
in
this
case
that
it
could
not
be
--
it
was
not
entirely
safe
considerable
for
that
purpose.
secondly,
and
just
--
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
i
assume,
your
honor
if
it
could
be
said
that
it
could
be
reasonably
foreseen
that
by
assigning
this
man
the
task
of
burning
these
weeds
with
a
hand
torch
that
it
could
be
assumed
that
he
would
and
with
knowledge
that
his
primary
duty,
in
his
own
words,
primary
duty
to
watch
and
tend
that
fire.
that
he
would
ignore
the
fire
in
order
to
watch
the
train
for
hotboxes.
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
--
and
then
placed
himself
in
a
position
where
he
voluntarily
stood.
no
one
told
him
to
stand
next
to
the
culvert.
for
all
that
is
shown
on
the
record,
he
could
have
stood
anywhere
north
of
where
he
was
or
on
this
area
three
feet
wide
on
the
dirt
platform.
he
stood
there
next
to
this
open
and
obvious
culvert
with
knowledge
that
the
fire
was
on
his
one
side
and
the
culvert
was
on
the
other.
and
then,
could
it
be
reasonably
foreseen
from
that
that
he
would
continue
to
ignore
his
fire
which
he
had
set
and
which
it
was
his
duty
to
tend
until
it
caught
up
with
him.
and
then,
could
it
--
from
that,
could
it
be
reasonably
assumed
that
he
would
then
have
to
put
his
arm
over
his
eyes
and
walk
backward
rapidly
over
a
condition
which
is
normally
and
otherwise
entirely
safe
and
suitable
for
the
use.
i
submit
under
the
doctrine
of
--
of
the
cases
set
down
here,
brady
versus
southern
railroad
company
where
it
is
said
by
this
court
that
negligence
must
be
a
link
in
a
chain
of
reasonably
foreseeable
events,
and
missouri
court
has
held
that
this
--
this
bizarre
situation
could
not
be
reasonably
foreseen
by
the
railroad
company
in
order
to
have
a
guard
against
insofar
as
the
culvert
was
concerned.
and
there's
another
reason
also,
your
honor,
there's
no
attempt
and
petitioner
does
not
claim
now
that
there
was
evidence
in
this
case
too
in
a
legal
manner,
present
a
question
of
knowledge
or
notice
on
behalf
of
the
railroad
company
as
to
any
alleged
dangerous
or
defect
--
defective
condition
in
this
culvert
whereby
in
the
exercise
of
reasonable
care,
he
could
have
discovered
the
alleged
defect.
and
in
the
exercise
of
reasonable
care
for
the
safety
of
its
employees
correct
--
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
there
can
be
two.
there
--
were
the
points
in
this
case
--
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
onto
the
provisions
--1
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
excuse
me,
sir.
it
goes
straight
to
the
supreme
court.
it
was
divided
itself
and
then
thereafter
it
maybe
heard
by
the
court
en
banc.
in
this
case,
a
full
hearing
was
denied.
it
was
heard
by
the
division
and
upon
application
for
full
a
hearing,
it
was
denied.
the
--
the
decision
of
the
division
being
announced
had
some
effect
on
that.
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
well,
the
negligence
was
charged
in
two
respects.
one,
that
the
method
of
work
was
unsafe
because
petitioner
was
given
a
--
a
torch
and
required
to
walk
along
the
right
of
way
to
do
his
work.
and
two,
there
was
negligence
charged
in
that
because
of
the
emergency
situation.
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
he
was
required
to
walk
upon
the
culvert
and
used
it
as
a
place
of
the
work
and
because
of
loosened
sloping
gravel,
it
was
--
there
was
--
inadequate
--
the
loosened
sloping
gravel
which
did
not
provide
adequate
for
footing
under
the
circumstances.
i
think
that's
the
wording
out
of
the
petition.
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
no,
no,
sir.
no,
sir.
it
was
a
drainage
culvert
running
under
the
right
of
way
as
ordinary,
i
presume
there
was
a
--
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
well
--
he
--
he
slipped
and
fell
to
his
buttocks.
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
slipped
and
fell
to
his
buttocks.
his
feet
went
from
underneath
him
as
he
went
backwards
there.
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
that's
right.
and
he
says
--
he
says
he
slipped
on
this
loose
gravel
which
of
course
assuming
which
we
do
not
admit,
but
assuming
that
the
loose
gravel
did
constitute
a
defect
of
the
petitioner
has
nothing
in
this
case
alleged
that
the,
or
proved
that
the
respondent,
railroad
company
was
in
a
--
in
any
legal
way
of
--
of
--
or
committed
any
act
or
omission
constituting
negligence.
we
didn't
know
about
the
situation.
they
don't
contend
we
know
about
it.
they
say
that
this
--
they
say
that
the
culvert
was
--
it
was
properly
constructed
as
such,
but
at
some
time
or
another,
we
don't
know
if
it
was
five
minutes
or
five
hours
or
when
it
was.
some
of
the
gravel
had
--
have
vibrated
out
to
--
out
of
place
off
the
ballast.
and
of
course,
we're
not
even
charged
with
notice
of
that
in
this
case.
and
i'm
thinking,
in
--
in
any
type
of
a
negligence
action
wherein
a
safe
place
of
work,
a
physical
condition
is
changed
to
create
a
danger,
the
employer
or
master
or
owner
of
the
premises
must
have
been
charged
with
knowledge,
actual
or
constructive
of
the
defect.
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
it
was
constructed.
i
think
the
evidence
shows
the
same.
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
no,
sir.
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
well,
that's
one
element
of
it.
that's
one
element
of
negligence.
the
other
of
course
is
the
method
of
work.
the
--
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
they
say
that.
and
they
say
that
--
actually,
by
his
own
testimony,
he
shows
that
he
had
no
trouble
with
the
burning
of
the
weeds.
we're
not
charged
incidentally
with
negligence
since
--
in
burning
these
weeds
in
this
case
but
only
with
the
method
whereby
it
was
done.
we're
not
charged
if
it
is
negligent
to
burn
these
weeds
because
they
presumably
constitute
somewhat
of
it,
a
--
a
hazard
to
the
men
who
have
to
get
on
and
off
the
trains
and
they
should
properly
be
removed.
but
--
but
it's
not
contended
in
any
ways
that
the
--
the
fire
as
such
was
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
railroad
company
but
what
is
contended
that
in
some
manner,
the
method
of
work
was
dangerous.
but
the
petitioner
himself
said
that
he
had
absolutely
no
trouble
burning
these
small
patches
of
weeds,
and
he
did
not
contend
that
the
use
of
the
hand
torch
which
is
alleged
enhanced
the
danger
of
the
fire
in
any
way.
now,
he
did
try
to
inject
into
the
case
a
question
of
a
fire
machine,
which
spouted
flame
out
onto
the
right
of
way,
but
--
and
presumably,
he
did
that
in
order
to
show
that
there
was
another
way
or
better
way
of
burning
the
weeds
than
using
a
hand
torch.
but
he
only
failed
to
come
up
to
par
in
the
evidence
on
that
respect
because
he
didn't
know
anything
about
the
fire
machine.
he
had
merely
seen
it
long
before
he
ever
went
to
work
for
the
railroad
pass
through
town.
he
didn't
know
anything
about
the
duty
of
the
crew
or
the
operation
of
it
or
anything
else.
the
only
man
who
was
old
enough
on
the
job
to
testify
about
the
fire
machine
was
the
foreman.
all
the
other
fellows
had
never
seen
the
thing
used,
and
the
fire
--
the
foreman
unequivocally
and
uncontradicted
stated
that
the
fire
machine
through
out
so
much
fire,
an
uncontrolled
fire
that
was
burning
the
creosote
ties
and
the
farmers'
adjoining
pasture
and
--
and
transposed
to
things
of
that
sort
so
they
abandoned
it,
convert
the
machine
to
spray
those
weed
killer
out
so
that
the
weeds
would
wither
and
die.
and
thereafter,
he
could
set
the
weeds
with
a
hand
torch
and
have
a
lot
less
fire
and
much
less
hazard,
but
--
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
i
--
i'm
--
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
if
the
court
please,
the
petitioner
now
contends
in
this
case
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
the
manner
or
method
or
place
of
work,
except
being
negligent
except
in
this
respect
on
page
16
of
their
brief,
which
is
directly
in
point
of
what
you
have
just
said.
the
petitioner
in
his
brief
says
that
the
respondent
created
an
emergency
situation
by
compelling
the
petitioner
to
watch
for
hotboxes
at
a
time
when
it
was
highly
dangerous
for
him
to
do
so.
it
was
the
imposition
of
these
concurrent
and
conflicting
duties
that
made
the
respondent's
method
of
work
an
unsafe
and
dangerous,
sir.
that
is
their
position.
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
now,
there
are
two
answers
to
that
which
--
excuse
me,
which
i
was
getting
to
but
i'll
--
i'll
consider
right
now.
in
the
first
place,
the
petitioner
never
stated
nor
did
he
contend
by
his
testimony
that
he
was
compelled
to
watch
a
train
for
hotboxes.
he
said
that
was
the
reason
he
left
this
fire,
but
at
the
same
time,
his
own
interpretation
of
this
previous
order
was
contrary
to
what
they're
contending
in
there
brief
now,
and
that
is
this.
that
he
knew
that
irregardless
of
what
--
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
why
he
left
the
fire
actually.
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
he
ignored
his
fire
and
he
knew
he
did
so
and
he
stated
that
he
did
not
construe
the
foreman's
orders
or
to
mean
that
he
should
did
so.
now,
that
was
his
own
words.
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
possibly
so.
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
possibly
so,
had
it
been
pleaded
as
an
act
of
negligence
in
this
case.
it
was
not.
that
was
the
second
reason.
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
there
is
nothing
in
the
pleading
in
regard
to
any
concurred
or
conflicting
duties
of
the
respondent,
your
honor,
compelled
on
the
person
by
the
respondent.
it
is
argued
that
that
is
part
of
the
whole.
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
the
first
time
it's
been
raised
was
when
they
got
here,
your
honor.
to
my
knowledge,
it's
a
mere
issue
in
the
case.
it
was
not
even
submitted
as
far
as
the
instructions
in
the
case
as
to
whether
or
not
he
was
compelled
to
be
there
by
a
reason
of
contrary
and
conflicting
duties.
i
assume
this
to
be
a
correct
statement
of
law
that
--
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
well,
the
same
would
apply,
no.
i
mean
--
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
no,
sir.
but
i
assume
that
this
is
a
correct
statement
of
law
that
as
your
honors
said.
if
you
have
this
ordinarily,
i
say
it,
method
of
work,
and
it
is
changed
to
something
which
is
unsafe
as
they
are
alleging
here
in
their
--
in
their
brief
that
if
they
are
saying
that
ordinarily,
this
men
are
in
method
of
performing
the
work
was
safe,
a
reasonably
safe
one.
but
it
was
changed
to
be
an
unsafe
one
by
a
reason
of
the
fact
that
there
were
concurrent
and
conflicting
duties.
then,
i
submit
that
those
--
that
--
that
is
the
reason
that
is
negligence.
that
is
the
ground
of
negligence
upon
which
they're
seeking
to
recover,
and
the
defendant
in
any
action
is
entitled
to
be
a
price
of
that
situation
in
the
pleading,
in
the
issues,
in
the
instructions
to
the
jury
and
they
were
not
in
this
case.
it
was
not
raised
until
this
appeal
here
and
it
was
never
before
contended
that
and
--
and
the
--
the
petition
in
this
case
--
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
--
mentioned
nothing
--
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
i
think
not.
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
that
on
the
occasion
herein,
they
mentioned
a
train
did
pass
and
did
cause
flame,
thus,
to
retreat
and
move
quickly
from
the
place
of
work
--
from
--
and
they
move
quickly
from
the
place
where
he
was
then
working
and
to
use
his
place
of
work
--
use
that
in
his
place
of
work,
a
part
the
defendant
has
said
right
of
way
adjoining
his
track
that
was
covered
with
loose
and
sloping
gravel
placed
it
safe
into
certain
method
and
then
goes
on
to
say
which
did
not
provide
adequate
or
sufficient
footing.
now,
as
to
--
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
as
to
the
--
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
that
he
was
imposed
--
that
the
concurrent
and
conflicting
duties
were
imposed
upon
him?
i
think
not
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
well,
i
--
i
think
it
would
be
enough
if
he
had
proved
that
there
was
a
dangerous
or
defective
conditions
as
to
the
culvert,
or
that
the
manner
or
method
taken
according
to
his
pleading
and
he
goes
on
further
to
say
as
to
the
manner
and
method
that
he
was
required
to
work
alongside
the
railroad
tracks
with
his
torch.
now,
assuming
from
that,
wherein
that
he
in
this
case
proved
that
those
methods,
that
method
in
that
place
of
work
were
not
reasonably
safe,
and
the
answer
i
think
by
his
own
admission
is
that
they
were
not
except
that
imposed
thereon,
he
now
says,
for
the
first
time,
where
a
concurrent
and
conflicting
duty
which
changed
the
situation.
now,
when
you
have
an
ordinarily
reasonably
safe
place
and
method
of
work
which
is
changed
by
some
act
or
omission,
raising
a
question
of
negligence
for
a
jury
to
decide
then
--
is
not
that
act
or
omission
which
is
the
issue
in
the
case,
not
the
hand
torch
method
or
the
gravel
and
so
forth,
and
that
is
our
position
here
in
this
court.
now,
here,
he
comes
up
and
--
and
having
realized
that
his
--
that
his
evidence
didn't
come
up
to
snaps
so
to
speak
insofar
as
the
gravel
condition
was
concerned.
and
realizing
that
his
evidence
did
not
came
up
to
snap
so
far
as
this
hand
torch
method
of
firing
the
right
of
way
as
the
petitioner
called
it,
enhanced
the
danger
of
fire.
he
then
says,
"oh,
yes",
but
the
concurrent
and
conflicting
duties
made
it
a
different
situation.
well,
that
different
situation
was
not
pleaded
in
his
petitions
submitted
to
the
jury
and
as
i
recall
was
not
argued
below.
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
well,
no,
not
exactly
that
way.
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
well,
he
--
he
says,
the
reason
he
went
and
the
reason
he
quit
firing
was
to
go
watch
the
train
for
hotboxes,
sir.
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
the
--
the
witnesses
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
it.
he
said
that
when
he
backed
up
there,
he
slipped
on
some
loose
and
sloping
gravel.
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
he
--
he
did
so
testified
that
when
he
backed
up,
he
--
he
slipped
on
some
loose
and
sloping
gravel.
i
think
that's
about
as
far
as
it
went.
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
at
--
there
was
some
--
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
--
a
test
of
statement
that
he
singed
his
eyebrows
was
the
extent
--
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
yes,
sir,
he
would.
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
but
the
--
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
no,
sir.
i
have
not.
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
it
might
well
be.
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
well,
in
--
not
in
the
manner
in
which
they're
now
alleging
now,
sir.
you
see
--
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
well,
i
--
i'm
inclined
to
disagree
with
your
honor,
except
to
this
extent.
had
they
come
in
to
court
and
said
that
he
was
compelled
by
these
concurrent
and
conflicting
duties
which
changed
a
normally
safe
manner
and
method
and
place
of
work
into
a
dangerous
or
unsafe
one,
then
i
think
he
would
and
--
and
submitted
a
sufficient
evidence
along
the
line.
i
--
i
don't
agree
with
the
--
with
the
construction,
but
they
can
be
argued
that
way
and
--
and
submitted
it
on
that
proposition
and
relied
upon
it,
then
of
course
we'd
have
a
different
case
entirely.
but
that's
the
precise
answer
i
give
to
this
statement
of
his
that
he
did
not
rely
on
it.
he's
relying
on
all
up
here,
but
he
didn't
rely
on
it
down
there.
he
relied
on
the
loosened
sloping
gravel
as
--
and
hopes
to
show
that
was
a
dangerous
or
not
reasonably
safe
condition.
and
his
evidence
wasn't
sufficient
for
it,
so
the
missouri
court
held
and
i
think
rightfully
--
rightfully
so.
he
relied
on
the
fact
that
he
was
required
to
work
alongside
this
railroad
track
where
all
section
men
incidentally
have
to
work.
there's
no
two
ways
about
that
with
a
hand
torch.
and
yet,
he
was
unable
to
say
how
or
in
what
manner
this
method
of
setting
the
weeds
enhanced
the
danger
of
the
fire
as
such.
now,
it
doesn't
and
accordance
with
what
your
honor
has
--
has
been
touching
on
here.
actually,
the
method
of
work,
the
method
of
causing
this
fire
or
burning
the
weeds
had
actually
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
acts
to
that
such
because
the
fellow
left
what
was
pleaded
to
be
the
dangerous
method
of
work
and
ran
34,
35
or
40
yards
ahead
of
it
and
stood
there
and
in
his
own
words
as
--
as
he
--
as
he
testified
as
how
the
accident
happened,
he
says,
“i
thought
i
was
far
enough
ahead
of
the
fire
to
where
i
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
--“
he
says,
“at
the
time
i
thought
i
was
far
enough
or
away,
i
was
pretty
far
enough
to
clear
myself
of
the
fire
or
any
danger
of
the
fire.
and
it
was
time
to
start
to
watch
these
journals.
so,
i
sat
down.
i
set
down
--
set
my
torch
down
on
the
end
of
a
tie.
i
was
standing
out
on
a
flat
surface,
watching
a
train
go
by.
after
the
train
had
gotten
approximately
half
or
two-thirds
of
the
way,
i
felt
this
heat
on
the
side
of
my
face.
i
turned
to
see
what
had
happened
then
it
was
fire
right
up
in
my
face.
i
threw
my
left
arm
over
my
face,
started
turning
to
the
west,
to
the
north,
backing
rapidly
away
from
the
fire
and
that
is
when
i
walked
in
on
this
culvert
and
slipped
and
fell.
so,
you
see,
actually,
the
hand
torch
and
what
was
pleaded
against
us
was
of
no
significance.
the
fact
of
the
matter
was
it
was
the
fire
there.
now,
it
wasn't
in
the
danger
of
the
fire
enhanced
by
the
method
of
setting
a
fire
which
as
alleged
to
be
negligence
in
this
particular
case.
he
was
away
from
the
fire.
he
went
completely
away
from
it.
he
stood
there
and
ignored
it.
presumably,
you
said
he
was
up
there
because
as
mr.
chief
justice
warren
has
pointed
this
other
order.
but
he
said
he
did
not
construe
that
order
to
mean
he
should
ignore
this
fire.
he
stood
there.
he
could've
looked
right
to
his
right
and
seen
what
was
happening
to
the
fire.
he
could
have
moved
across
the
culvert.
he
knew
the
culvert
was
there.
he
knew
he
was
standing
next
to
it.
he
knew
that
--
that
he
was
between
the
culvert
and
the
fire
which
he
had
left.
and
therefore,
i
submit
that
if
the
evidence
does
not
come
up
to
say
that
the
concurrent
and
conflicting
duties
caused
him
to
ignore
the
fire.
he
didn't
so
contend
by
his
own
words
but
if
it
be
said
that
there
was
a
jury
proposition
involved
in
that
respect
then
i
frankly
submit
to
this
court
that
that
was
an
element
which
should
have
been
pleaded
and
submitted.
mr.
donald
b.
sommers
thank
you,
your
honor.
in
the
connection
with
what
i
was
taking
up
before
recess,
it
is
claimed
in
the
reply
brief
by
petitioner
that
they
did
produce
sufficient
evidence
of
negligence
if
you
look
to
the
whole
of
the
case
and
not
just
to
the
component
parts
which
were
fitted
in
the
case.
if
the
whole
of
the
case,
i
submit
to
the
court
includes
the
concurrent
duties
or
the
inexperience
of
petitioner,
which
is
set
up
in
the
recent
response
of
petitioner
as
grounds
for
recovery,
then
these
are
acts
of
negligence
which
caused
otherwise
safe
methods
and
otherwise
safe
places
of
work
to
become
unsafe
if
that
be
the
fact
and
they
should
be
pleaded.
the
whole
of
the
case
--
looking
to
the
whole
of
the
case
certainly
does
not
mean
that
the
component
parts
can
be
ignored.
and
i
submit
that
evidence
can
only
be
fairly
apprised
or
appraised
by
looking
at
it
step
by
step.
in
addition,
as
exampled
as
to
why
the
whole
of
the
case
should
be
looked
to,
petitioner
says
that
even
though
the
pleaded
elements
such
as
the
culvert,
the
condition
of
the
culvert
and
the
hand
torch
method
of
firing
it
right
away
were
not
of
themselves
acts
of
negligence.
combined,
they
were
on
the
theory
of
mrs.
o'leary's
account
on
page
21
of
appellant's
brief
or
petitioner's
brief,
wherein
it
says
that
the
state
court's
faulty
conclusions
are
due
--
due
to
the
fact
that
it
detaches
and
separates,
(1),
the
combined
dangers
involved,
(2),
the
place
of
work
and
(3),
the
method
of
work
from
each
other.
by
this
process,
it
was
able
to
say
that
torching
in
and
of
itself
was
not
dangerous.
the
train
was
perfectly
safe
and
the
culvert
was
adequate
for
ordinary
purposes.
the
petitioner
goes
on
to
say
these
truisms
take
on
a
different
meaning
when
we
consider
the
manner
in
which
they
were
being
used.
for
illustration,
a
cow
is
a
docile
animal,
and
an
oil
iron
is
a
simple
appliance
and
barns
are
commonplace
structures,
but
we
learned
through
mrs.
o'leary
that
they
cannot
be
used
successfully
in
close
and
dangerous
proximity
to
each
other.
and
i
think
that
is
the
gist
of
the
appeal
of
this
case
and
i
submit
that
what
they
are
saying
there
that
we,
according
to
the
evidence,
use
an
ordinary
and
reasonably
foreseeable
method
of
setting
fire
to
the
weeds.
we
used
an
ordinary
and
reasonably
safe
method
or
place
for
this
man
to
work.
but
since
we
added
the
petitioner
himself,
it
became
dangerous
and
that
is
what
they
are
saying
by
that
language.
and
we
of
course
tied
the
torch
to
the
tail
of
a
cow
which
didn't
know
what
it
was
doing
by
reasonably
anticipate
that
he
might
get
himself
involved
in
the
fire,
but
the
railroad
did
not
in
this
case
set
a
fire
and
leave
it
abandoned
so
that
passing
trains
or
winds
could
cause
it
to
sweep
down
upon
unsuspecting
employees.
that
was
not
the
situation.
it
delegated
the
duty
of
this
petitioner
to
go
out
there
and
watch
and
attend
the
fire.
he
was
the
one,
the
only
one,
who
was
supposed
to
know
how
much
fire
he
had
at
one
time
and
know
and
what
precise
point
along
the
right
of
way
it
was
burning.
the
fact
that
he
chose
to
later
do
so
--
later
ignore
the
fire
in
order
to
watch
for
hotboxes,
although
he
knew
it
was
his
primary
duty
to
do
otherwise.
while
it
may
not
be
an
act
of
negligence,
it's
not
necessary
for
respondent
to
--
to
contend
he
was
negligent
in
that
respect.
the
point
of
it
is
the
ignorance
--
his
ignorance
of
the
fire
does
not
constitute
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
respondent.
now,
as
to
the
missouri
court's
opinion,
it
has
been
stated
by
the
respondent
that
the
missouri
court
ignored
the
dictates
of
this
court
under
cases
--
in
cases
of
--
of
the
federal
employers
liability
act,
and
i
submit
that
it
did
not.
there
was
no
conflicting
evidence
which
was
argued
to
the
court
below.
there
was
no
conflicting
evidence
which
the
court
had
their
way
as
in
wilkerson
versus
mccarthy.
it
did
not
do
so.
it
took
only
that
evidence,
most
favorable
to
the
petitioner
and
applied
it
to
the
pleadings
and
the
issues
raised
by
petitioner
in
this
case.
it
did
not
ignore
reasonable
inferences
of
fact
as
in
lavender
versus
kurn,
tennant
versus
peoria
and
schulz
versus
pennsylvania
railroad
company,
wherein
in
those
cases,
the
deceased
was
unable
to
speak
for
himself
and
tell
the
exact
details
of
the
accident
and
the
case
necessarily
had
to
be
made
from
circumstantial
evidence
from
where
--
from
--
from
which
juries
could
make
reasonable
inferences
and
--
and
reasonable
minds
could
differ
it.
the
court
did
not
have
that
proposition
because
the
petitioner
himself
was
in
court
and
told
everything
that
happened
and
gave
his
whole
and
complete
version
of
what
happened
there.
and
i
submit
that
all
of
the
missouri
court
did
is
agree
with
me
that
even
on
taking
the
evidence
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
this
petitioner,
there
is
much
to
be
said
about
the
condition
of
the
right
of
way
even
from
his
own
words,
whether
or
not
that
constituted
a
danger
where
there
was
a
question
raised.
there
was
much
to
be
said
for
there
was
no
evidence
as
to
whether
or
not
the
culvert
was
safe
or
suitable
for
reasonably
foreseeable
circumstances
as
brady
versus
southern
indicated
by
this
court
as
required.
and
furthermore,
the
court
also
said
that
in
as
much
as
the
fire
was
not
by
the
respondent
left
unwatched,
unintended,
it
cannot
be
said
that
the
use
of
the
hand
torch
and
that
method
of
setting
the
fire
enhanced
the
danger
of
the
fire,
because
it
was
not
left
unwatched
and
unattended
by
the
respondent.
it
was
left
unwatched
and
unattended
by
this
24-year-old
man
whom
i
assume
has
reasonable
and
ordinary
intelligence,
raised
in
the
country
down
in
arkansas.
and
he
alone
knew
that
was
his
duty
to
watch
the
fire
and
did
not
charge
anyone
else.
certainly,
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
was
assigned
a
simple
task
and
given
a
simple
appliance,
all
that
was
expected
of
him.
and
i
--
by
the
way,
i
--
i
don't
mean
to
imply
to
this
court
that
had
he
watched
this
train
for
hotboxes
as
he
did,
as
he
says
he
did
that
he
was
to
be
in
any
way
is
criticized.
all
we
ask
that
he
not
get
himself
involved
in
the
job
in
which
he
was
then
and
there
assigned
to
do.
and
i
submit
to
this
court
that
a
reasonable
and
prudent
employee
could
not
anticipate
the
bizarre
set
of
circumstances
which
resulted
in
the
accident
to
this
employee.
certainly,
on
the
pleaded
issues,
the
petitioner
cannot
be
heard
now
to
raise
this
question
of
inexperience
or
on
the
plea
of
the
issues.
he
cannot
be
heard
to.
now,
for
the
first
time
say
that
an
emergency
situation
was
created
because
of
conflicting
and
concurrent
duties.
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
unanimous
decision
of
the
missouri
supreme
court
ought
to
be
affirmed
by
this
court
as
submitted.
