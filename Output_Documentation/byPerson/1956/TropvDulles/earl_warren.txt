mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
which
was
it?
do
you
know?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
chief
justice
earl
warren
which
was
it?
was
he
apprehended
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
record
doesn't
show.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
made
a
distinction
as
i
understood
it
yesterday
between
rights
of
citizenship
that
are
restored
by
pardon
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
citizenship
itself.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
--
then
--
but
today,
apparently,
you
--
you
equate
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
you
said
in
response
to
--
to
justice
frankfurter
that
he
was
doing
the
equivalent
of
what
he
does
in
other
cases
of
pardon
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
towards
citizenship.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
--
what
power
is
given
to
the
president
to
--
to
make
a
person
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
if
he
is
not
a
citizen
of
the
united
states?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
said
it
could.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
guess
he
wouldn't
be
an
american.he
wouldn't
be
an
american
as
you
have
said.
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
me
ask
you
this,
mr.
davis.
you
--
you
think
that
the
president
in
the
case
of
this
kind,
by
giving
a
man
a
pardon,
could
restore
his
citizenship.
now,
let
me
ask
you
about
a
--
a
case
where
there
has
been
a
voluntary
abandonment
of
citizenship.
could
the
president
restore
that
person
by
his
act
to
american
citizenship?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
let's
take
the
case
that
just
went
ahead
of
this
one,
the
japanese
case,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
where
a
man
joined
the
--
or
was
conscript
to
the
japanese
army.
you
say
now
that
he
is
not
an
american.
chief
justice
earl
warren
has
the
president
any
power
to
give
him
american
citizenship?
chief
justice
earl
warren
based
--
based
upon
what
power
of
the
president?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
isn't
convicted
to
any
offense.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
what
is
he
going
to
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
--
can
this
--
can
the
president
pardon
him
for
a
disability?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fraenkel.

chief

chief

i
--
chief

warren
perez
brief,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
general,
would
you
tell
me
what
--
what
that
item
is
on
page
63,
desertion
from
the
armed
forces
in
one
--
in
war
time
(inaudible)
is
that
all
that
--
is
that
all
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
arose
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
out
of
the
millions
that
are
in
the
service?
chief
justice
earl
warren
apparently
so
understood
it
because
it
says
desertion
from
armed
forces
in
war
time
and
that
it
gives
a
number
four
in
1950
which
was
the
year
of
the
korean
war.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll

chief
justice
earl

what

to
the
truck
driver
that
he
did
what
from
the
hospital?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
oh,
just
said
he
was
from.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
truck
driver
take
them
into
custody?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know.
did
he
take
them
into
custody?
i
mean,
when
--
when
they
got
into
the
--
to
get
them
into
the
truck
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
did
it
say
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
general,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
would
fairly
support
the
conclusion
that
he
was
deserting
to
the
enemy?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there's
nothing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
--
what
was
he
in
prison
for
the
first
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
doesn't
show.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
general,
are
there
any
--
any
reports
--
any
government
reports
that
show
how
many
people
were
or
how
many
soldiers
did
desert
and
how
many
were
convicted
of
court
--
by
court-martial
and
how
many
were
--
were
--
have
their
citizenship
restored.
would
the
army
--
any
army
report
show
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
know?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
there
are
any
--
if
there
are
any
such,
i
wonder
if
you'd
be
good
enough
to
get
it
for
us.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
