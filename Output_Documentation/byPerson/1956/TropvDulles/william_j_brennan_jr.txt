justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
davis,
before
you
start
your
argument,
do
you
--
does
the
government
have
any
statistics
to
indicate
how
many
deserters
from
domestic
military
facilities
during
the
war
who
were
dishonorably
discharged?
i
don't
mean
in
the
war
of
theater
but
from
camps
here
in
the
united
states.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
am
i
correct
that
--
as
to
any
who
were
not
and
who
were
convicted
of
desertion
within
the
united
states,
they
also
have
lost
their
citizenship
under
this
provision?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
can
appreciate
that,
but
where
are
they
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
gather
those
that
i
had
in
mind
just
means
i
can
never
leave
the
united
states?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
could
never
get
back
in,
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
they
could
never
leave
it
legally
in
any
event
because
they
can
never
get
a
visa.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
would
you
understand
mr.
fraenkel's
argument
as
directed
to
interpretation,
instruction
of
this
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
apart
from
the
point
of
invalidity?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
the
way
i
understand
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
davis,
you
referred
to
the
desertion
as
a
military
crime?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
suppose
that
congress
could
deprive
a
felon
committed
--
convict
of
a
civil
crime
of
his
nationality
and
citizenship?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
--
let's
suppose
it
were
a
crime
of
murder
for
which
he
gets
a
life
sentence.
did
the
congress
say
that
everyone
convicted
of
the
crime
of
murder
shall
be
thereby
deprived
of
his
nationality
and
citizenship?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
not
--
that
--
that
might
not
be
the
case
to
deal
perhaps
in
the
crime
of
murder.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
if
it
were
--
suppose
there
were
conviction
of
the
--
of
a
crime
of
election
frauds.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then,
let's
assume
--
let's
assume
that
the
government
--
that
the
congress
could
with
reason,
as
i
would
suppose
it
could,
conclude
that
election
frauds
were
violations
of
one
of
the
prime
obligations
of
citizenship.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
--
then
your
--
your
--
the
government's
distinction
then
is
whether
or
not
the
particular
conviction,
whether
it's
a
military
offense
or
of
a
civil
offense.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
particular
conduct,
whether
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
it
happens
to
be
a
military
or
a
civil
crime
indicates
what,
in
respect
of
investigation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
in
that
case,
you
think
that
no
distinction
will
be
made
between
civil
and
criminal
--
civil
and
military
offenses?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
--
i
was
interested
because
apparently,
senator
mccarran
doesn't
agree
with
you.
i
noticed
that
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
has
not
any
reference
to
that
but
i
noticed
that
he
said
that
he
thinks
a
serious
doubt
about
the
constitutional
right
of
the
congress
to
deprive
a
man
of
the
citizenship
as
a
criminal
penalty,
depriving
a
felon
of
the
civil
rights,
but
of
course,
an
accepted
thing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
depriving
a
felon
of
a
citizenship
which
means
his
basic
nationality
is
an
entirely
different
matter.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
what
he
was
saying
here
that
was
at
least
as
to
a
civil
crime,
you
can't
--
you
may
deprive
him
of
rights
of
citizenship
but
you
can't
deprive
him
of
nationality,
whether
or
not
it
happens
to
relate
too.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
this
is
yale
in
the
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor,
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
any
short
form
naturalization
procedure
available
that
is
going
on?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
this
case.
page

in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
know
whether
these
figures
at
62
and
63
that
requires
the
--
reflect
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
did
take
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
i
take
it
under
the
statute
the
dishonorable
discharge
for
desertion
within
the
continent
of
the
united
states
would
have
the
consequence
of
expatriation
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
know
whether
these
figures
reflect
any
cases
of
that
kind?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
speaking
of
62
and
63
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
suppose
all
of
these
are
cases
of
desertions
overseas,
do
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
during
the
korean
period.
well
that
was
--
that
was
the
--
the
statute
would
apply
then,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
the
incident
was
the
war
for
that
purpose
would
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
just
surprised
because
apparently
this
purging
provision
by
its
terms
would
affect
of
only
those
january
20,
1944,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
prior
or
--
it
does,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
this
might
have
applied
as
well
during
the
korean
--
as
desertions
during
the
korean
war
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
does
the
1865
statute
actually
strip
citizenship?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
it
strip
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
strip
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
it
make
the
individual
a
stateless
person?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
quite
a
difference
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
mr.
solicitor,
i
think
it
solved
the
barrier
that
perhaps
with
mr.
davis,
i'm
not
sure
of
--
of
this
question
of
the
kind
of
review
in
cases
like
this,
judicial
review.
i
think
you've
told
it
was
a
trial
de
novo?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
what's
the
nature
of
the
trial
de
novo
that
would
be
available
in
this
instance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
all.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
they're
taking
it.
