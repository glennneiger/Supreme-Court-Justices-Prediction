mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
may
it
please
the
court.
this,
also,
is
a
nationality
case.
it
comes
here
in
an
action
for
a
declaratory
judgment,
instituted
by
the
petitioner
here
after
he
had
been
denied
a
passport.
the
basis
for
the
denial
of
the
passport
was
that,
in
1944,
when
he
was
serving
with
the
armed
forces
in
casablanca,
he
had
been
convicted
by
court
martial
of
desertion
and
dishonorably
discharged.
and
therefore,
came
within
subsection
(g)
of
the
nationality
act
of
1940
which
provides
for
loss
of
nationality
under
such
circumstances.
in
the
action,
motions
for
summary
judgment
were
made
by
both
parties.
the
plaintiff,
submitting
an
affidavit
to
which
was
a
next
state
summary
of
the
court
martial
proceedings.
in
that
affidavit,
he
stated
that
he
was
--
had
been
then
20
years
old,
that
he
had
been
confined
in
casablanca
by
reason
of
some
breaches
of
military
discipline.
that
finding,
the
conditions
of
his
confinement
as
he
says
intolerable,
he
had
escaped
from
confinement,
had
never
left
the
area
controlled
by
american
troops.
and
on
the
day
following
his
escape,
had
surrendered
himself.
and
the
excerpt
from
the
court
martial
proceedings
consists
of
the
testimony
of
the
officer
to
whom
he
surrendered
himself
and
a
sergeant
who
accompanied
that
officer,
which
stated
that
petitioner
at
the
time
was
walking
along
the
road
from
a
place
called
meknes
which
is
variously
spelled
moknes
to
rabat.
and
as
the
atlas
indicates,
that's
going
back
toward
casablanca,
instead
of
away
toward
the
spanish-moroccan
border.
petitioner
stated
at
the
court
martial
that
he
had
escaped
because
of
his
intolerable
conditions
and
because
he
had
some
notion
that
he
might
be
able
to
rejoin
his
own
battalion,
which
have
been
sent
to
italy.
in
his
affidavit,
he
states
that
he
had
no
intention
to
contact
the
enemy.
that
he
had
made
no
attempt
to
contact
the
enemy.
that
he
had
no
connection
with
any
foreign
state
of
any
kind,
whatsoever.
the
judge
in
the
district
court
agreed
with
the
parties
that
there
were
no
issues
of
fact,
no
disputed
issues
of
fact,
and
therefore,
that
the
case
was
right
for
decision
on
summary
judgment.
in
two
brief
memoranda,
which
deal
with
none
of
the
legal
questions
presented
to
him,
the
judge
granted
the
defendant's
motion
and
denied
the
plaintiffs.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
affirmed,
and
judge
clark
dissenting.
the
majority
in
the
court
rejected
a
contention,
which
i
had
made
on
behalf
of
petitioner
that
the
statute
should
be
construed,
to
be
applicable
only
to
those
who
desert
to
the
enemy.
the
court,
feeling
that
there
was
no
sufficient
doubt
about
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
to
justify
such
an
interpretation.
the
court
did
not
specifically
discuss
the
constitutional
questions,
other
than
to
recite
this
court's
decisions
in
mackenzie
and
savorgnan
in
repudiation
of
the
notion,
which
i
had
advanced
to
that
court
and
do
not
advance
here,
that
nationality
cannot
be
lost
absent
--
a
desire
to
loose
it.
that
is
not
my
position.
my
position
is
that
congress
has
no
power
to
destroy
the
nationality
of
a
native-born
american,
except,
one,
to
consent
to
a
voluntary
abjuration
of
such
nationality
or
accession
of
other
nationality,
and
two,
to
regulate
dual
nationality.
my
position,
being
that
congress
has
no
power,
either
under
the
broad
provisions
of
the
constitution
as
a
sovereign
or
under
the
limitations
of
the
constitution
found
both
in
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
prohibition
against
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
in
the
eighth
amendment,
to
decree
loss
of
nationality
to
--
to
a
native-born
citizen
because
of
some
act
permitted
by
that
citizen,
which
the
congress
may
think
inimicable,
inimical
to
the
interest
of
the
united
states
where
that
act
has
no
relation
whatsoever.
as
i
submit
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
act
has
no
such
relation
to
the
acquisition
of
nationality
elsewhere
or
to
any
manifestation
of
allegiance
to
another
country,
that
loss
of
nationality
may
not
be
an
instrument
of
domestic
policy,
but
is
an
instrument
of
international
policy.
now,
perhaps
the
breadth
of
my
position
maybe
illustrated
if
i
attempt
a
brief
spectrum
of
the
various
provisions
of
law,
which
permit
or
decree
loss
of
nationality.
starting
at
the
clearest
point,
you
have
subsections
(f)
and
(i)
of
the
1940
act,
which
provide
for
loss
of
nationality
where
a
citizen
has
abjured,
either
in
this
country
or
elsewhere
under
certain
form.
and
then,
you
have
the
case
under
subsection
(a),
where
the
citizen
has
formally
upheld
the
nationality
of
another
country.
and
then,
you
have
the
provision
which
we
discussed
yesterday,
which
is
no
longer
in
the
law,
a
provision
of
the
1907
act,
construed
in
the
mackenzie
case
where
nationality
was
lost
at
least
temporarily
because
of
marriage
to
a
foreigner,
the
woman
in
that
case
acquiring
an
additional
nationality.
i
might
suggest
parenthetically
that
i
think
mackenzie
was
wrongly
decided
insofar
as
it
permitted
loss
of
nationality
to
a
person
who
had
not
left
the
united
states.
i
can
concede
that
if
a
married
woman,
acquiring
nationality
elsewhere,
those
--
the
country
of
that
acquired
nationality,
considerations
of
possible
international
embarrassment
might
arise.
but
i
cannot
conceive
how
they
could
arise
so
long
as
you
remained
in
this
country,
and
therefore,
to
that
extent,
i
would
say
that
mackenzie
had
been
wrongly
decided.
but
of
course,
i
didn't
go
that
far
in
my
case.
and
then,
we
come
to
those
cases
where
an
oath
of
allegiance
has
been
taken,
although,
no
formal
acquisition
of
citizenship.
and
there,
i
think
we
enter
--
or
rather
we
leave
the
area
of
the
first
category,
permissible
to
congress,
declaration
of
loss
of
a
nationality
here
where
a
nationality
elsewhere
has
been
acquired.
and
we
enter
the
more
debatable
area
of
the
regulation
of
dual
nationality,
which
may
arise
in
connection
with
voting
in
a
foreign
election,
holding
public
office,
serving
in
foreign
armies
or
various
things
of
that
kind.
and
there,
i
recognized
that
the
government
has
power
to
act,
but
i
believe
as
counsel
in
the
earlier
cases
before
this
court
indicated,
that
congress
has
no
power
to
create
a
conclusive
presumption.
it
could
lay
down
certain
conditions
under
which
these
acts
might
constitute
loss
of
nationality,
giving
an
opportunity
--
where
those
conditions
indicate
a
choice
of
allegiance.however,
again,
i
need
not
go
that
far
here.
somewhere
along
this
middle
area
is
the
case
which
might
arise,
where
the
statute
which
i
am
concerned
with
construed
as
i
had
suggested
below
and
as
i
also
suggest
here
as
limited
to
desertion
to
the
enemy.
because
there,
although,
there
would
be
no
acquisition,
perhaps,
of
a
new
nationality.
the
act
of
desertion
to
the
enemy
may
be
so
unequivocal
as
treason
would
be,
so
unequivocal,
a
--
an
informal
abjuration
of
allegiance
to
this
country
as
to
justify
congressional
declaration
on
the
subject.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no,
no,
so
far
as
i
know
he
did
not.
i
say
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no,
but
of
course,
a
person
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no,
i
have
--
i
haven't
raised
doubts
about
desertion
to
the
enemy,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no,
i
--
i
would
suggest
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
at
--
to
take
the
first
case
that
i
mentioned,
a
formal
abjuration
of
united
states
citizenship
may
not
result
in
acquisition
of
citizenship
elsewhere.
and
under
those
particular
circumstances
might
result
as
the
voluntary
act,
deliberate
voluntary
act
of
the
former
american
citizen.
and
i
consider
treason
to
be
of
that
character,
and
i
think
desertion
to
the
enemy
of
that
character,
because
while
there
no
citizenship
has
been
acquired
elsewhere,
the
act
is
of
such
a
character
that
it
can
properly
be
described
as
abjuration
of
allegiance.
but
i
say
a
desertion
which
in
this
case
is
not
even
the
normal
desertion
of
an
intent
to
avoid
military
service,
that
the
desertion
technically
defined
by
the
articles
of
war,
namely,
absence
from
a
post
of
duty
to
avoid
unpleasant
service
and
i
suppose,
escape
from
confinement
comes
within
that
description.
it
is
an
unpleasant
service
to
be
confined.
and
in
any
event,
the
court
martial
so
found,
but
it
has
relation,
no
conceivable
relation
to
allegiance
to
the
united
states.
it's
an
offense.
of
course,
it's
an
offense,
and
it's
an
offense
for
which
a
person
deserves
to
be
punished
and
this
man
was
sentenced
to
serve
at
hard
labor
for
a
period
of
years
and
he
served
that
sentence,
so
that
i
come
now
to
that
area
such
as
this,
to
this
kind
of
desertion
which
has
no
connection
with
any
foreign
country
of
any
sort
whatsoever.
the
statute
doesn't
even
require
that
desertion
occur
outside
the
united
states.
and
of
course,
the
circumstance
that
this
did
occur
outside
of
the
united
states
was
no
voluntary
act
of
this
individual.
he
was
taken
to
casablanca
by
the
army.
he
wasn't
there
of
his
own
choice,
so
it's
in
irrelevance.
in
any
case,
there
was
no
contact
with
the
enemy.
no
intent
to
have
contact
with
the
enemy
of
any
kind
whatsoever.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
it's
for
him
to
determine,
so
long
as
what
he
has
done.
he
is
not
of
such
a
character
as
to
indicate
an
abjuration
of
allegiance.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
but
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
subject
to
this
court's
final
decisions
to
whether
he
was
right.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
after
all
--
no
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
that
is
correct.
again,
with
the
qualification
that
i
made
a
moment
ago,
up
to
the
point
where
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
that
what
he
has
done
is
as
it
would
be
as
i
suggested
in
the
case
of
treason
or
in
the
case
of
desertion
to
the
enemy,
an
abjuration
of
this
allegiance
to
this
country.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
i
say
that
--
that
in
that
area,
the
attribution
has
reasonableness.
in
other
areas,
it
has
no
reasonableness
and
the
due
process
clause
does
restrict
the
power
of
congress
over
loss
of
nationality,
assuming
that
it
has
so
brought
a
power
as
the
government
claims
for
it.
the
government
recognizes
that
the
due
process
clause
is
a
limitation,
and
if
the
due
process
clause
means
anything,
it
means
that
there
must
be
a
rational
relationship
between
the
objective,
which
is
here
allegiance
and
the
particular
act
involved.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
but
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
exactly,
sir.
the
constitution
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
that
is
correct,
except
that
i
should
suppose
that
congress
in
the
laws
related
to
naturalization
could
impose
certain
conditions
which
might
subsequently
affect
the
naturalized
citizen
if
those
were
in
effect
at
the
time
that
he
became
naturalized.
and
in
that
respect,
have
greater
power
than
with
a
natural-born
citizen
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
--
but
that's
not
here.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
he
did.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
i
--
i
would
--
no
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
in
any
event,
sir,
i
would
say
this.
since
this
court
has
held,
and
i
don't
think
that
it
will
review
that
holding
in
any
of
these
cases
that
nationality
maybe
lost
under
circumstances.
although,
the
citizen
didn't
intend
subjectively
to
lose
it,
as
in
savorgnan
for
instance
where
his
act
is
contrary
to
--
or
her
act
is
contrary
to
her
on
disclosed
intention.
there
can
well
be
an
area
whereas
you
can
suggest
it.
congress
lays
down
a
formula,
which
may
be
contrary
to
the
subjective
intent
of
the
individual.
i
say
congress
may
have
that
power
where
the
act
involved
is
so
clearly
of
the
character
of
a
transfer
or
abjuration
of
allegiance.
that
any
reasonable
man
would
so
conclude
that
it
has
no
power
to
do
that
where
the
act
involved,
however,
heinous
it
may
be,
however,
contrary
to
the
laws
of
the
country
it
may
be,
has
no
real
connection
with
allegiance.
now,
a
person
--
a
person
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no.
well,
certainly
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
certainly
on
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
but
it's
an
essential
content.
i
think
all
of
the
authorities
indicate
is
the
concept
of
allegiance.
moreover,
as
many
of
the
authorities
indicate,
the
regulation
of
nationality
is
properly
speaking
only
in
an
international
subject.
i
have
taken
the
liberty
to
quote
to
this
court
a
paragraph,
which
makes
that
clear
from
the
writings
of
an
argentine
jurist,
who
has
had
a
great
experience
in
this
area,
and
who
was
a
professor
in
buenos
aires.
and
he
wrote
a
large
number
of
books
on
various
international
law
subjects
and
i
think
his
formulation
of
it
is
clearer
than
that
found
anywhere
else,
where
he
says
that,
“nationality
is
a
matter
of
international
law,
rights
of
citizenship
a
matter
of
domestic
law.”
and
i
know
it
was
a
good
deal
of
discussion
yesterday
about
this
phrase,
“rights
of
citizenship
in
the
old
1865
statute,”
that
government
counsel
maintained
that
that
was
the
equivalent
of
loss
of
citizenship
and
i
must
concede
that
there
are
many
cases
which
so
hold.
but
i
do
still
think
that
clear
thinking,
whereas
a
distinction
between
the
two
concepts
and
that
the
regulation
of
nationality
is
irrelevant
to
wrongs
done
by
the
individual
towards
the
state,
until
those
reach
the
point
which
i
have
--
i
don't
want
to
repeat
it
unnecessarily,
heretofore
elaborate.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
that
is
correct.
and
it
may
well,
but
i
suggest
that
when
congress
uses
a
catch
or
term
such
as
desertion,
which
under
the
articles
of
war
can
include
an
occurrence
such
as
--
is
the
basis
for
asserted
loss
of
nationality
here.
that
congress
has
gone
beyond
its
proper
scope.
that
it
has
embraced
within
the
concept,
act
so
varies,
so
unrelated
to
essential
obligation
of
citizenship.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
may
i
suggest
with
all
deference
that
the
desertions
involved
which
led
to
the
adoption
of
the
1865
statute
were
not
this
kind
of
desertion.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
this
--
this
will
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
that
wasn't
--
that
was
of
course
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
the
man
who
falls
asleep
i
suppose
is
subject
to
military
discipline,
which
may
result
of
course
in
a
sentence
of
death.
this
particular
offense
theoretically
could
have
resulted
in
a
sentence
of
death
because
it
was
committed
in
war
time.
and
congress
has,
i
suppose,
power
to
provide
for
death
sentences
in
situations
with
which
this
court
is
not
likely
evident
in
here,
and
had
this
petitioner
been
sentenced
to
death,
i
wouldn't
be
here.
he
wouldn't
be
here.
but
he
has
been
allowed
to
live
and
the
fact
that
he
might
have
been
sentenced
to
death
and
that
the
president
might
not
commuted
his
sentence,
i
submit
it
has
no
bearing
on
the
particular
problem
with
which
this
court
is
now
confronted
with
which
i'm
trying
my
best
to
deal.
i
want
to
say
one
other
thing
briefly
and
then
i
would
like
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal.
the
question
yesterday
also
came
up
of
possible
deportation
of
persons,
who,
by
reason
of
this
loss
of
nationality,
might
become
aliens.
and
of
course,
this
particular
petitioner
would
become
stateless,
and
as
i
have
argued
in
my
brief,
i
submit
that
that
would
be
cruel
and
an
unusual
punishment,
but
i'm
living
that
in
my
brief.
i
want
to
suggest,
however,
that
in
this
particular
petitioner's
case,
deportation
might
also
result
because
this
petitioner
was
confined
by
the
army
in
casablanca.
and
then,
he
came
back
to
the
united
states
after
his
dishonorable
discharge
and
the
immigration
people
claimed
that
his
entry
into
the
united
states
on
that
occasion
was
an
illegal
one
because
he
was
then
an
alien
and
having
no
visa.
so
that
if
this
court
should
sustain
the
judgment
below,
he
would
be
probably
subject
to
deportation
and
with
--
one
of
these
wonderers
because
presumably,
no
country
would
take
him,
not
that
there's
anything
that
matter
with
him
but
he
isn't
a
national
of
any
country.
there's
no
reason
why
any
country
should
take
him.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
a
respectable
responsible
citizen,
working
for
an
aviation
company
and
unfortunately
there
is
no
way
that
he
can
remain
an
american
national,
absent
a
reversal
by
this
court
because
the
statute
provides
for
a
--
restoration
of
nationality.
only
in
the
one
case
of
restoration
to
armed
service
during
at
time
of
war
which
is
of
course
impossible
in
this
case.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
i'll
briefly
say
this.
i
don't
think
it
makes
very
much
difference
when
you
call
it
disability
or
punishment.
its
consequences
are
the
same.
i
would
like
to
point
out,
however,
in
answer
to
what
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
i
think
provisions
of
the
bill
of
rights
belong
in
--
in
any
case,
certainly
the
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
--
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
oh,
yes.
i'm
not
--
no,
but
i
do
wanted
to
make
this
thought
with
the
court.
the
statute
does
not
impose
loss
of
nationality,
merely
because
of
the
court-martial
conviction.
there
is
an
additional
condition
imposed,
namely,
that
there'll
be
a
dishonorable
discharge
by
the
army.
and
to
that
extent,
i
might
suggest
that
an
element
has
entered
into
here,
which
is
wholly
outside
of
any
volition
on
the
part
of
the
person
involved.
you
have
a
--
it
indicates
where
a
man
has
done
an
act
which
--
for
which
he
may
be
convicted
and
let's
take
the
chances
of
that
being
established,
it
is
an
independent,
non-civilian,
mental
operation
which
has
to
be
imposed
here.
namely,
the
dishonorable
discharge
and
that
i
should
be
--
it
doesn't
lead
the
case
in
a
somewhat
different
posture.
thank
you.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
briefly
to
remind
the
court
of
the
facts
of
this
case
which
comes
under
subdivision
(g)
to
which
reference
has
already
been
made,
namely,
the
subdivision
which
deprives
an
american
national
of
his
nationality
if
after
conviction
by
court-martial
for
desertion
in
time
of
war,
he
is
dishonorably
discharged.
in
this
case,
we
had
a
man
who
was
20
years
old,
taken
by
the
american
forces
to
casablanca,
who
there
got
into
difficulty
with
the
military
authorities
and
was
placed
in
confinement,
who
escaped
and
was
brought
back.
and
some
couple
of
weeks
later
escaped
a
second
time
was
away
a
day
and
on
the
second
--
on
the
first
whole
day
surrendered
to
american
patrols
as
he
was
walking
some
miles
away
but
back
towards
the
place
from
which
he
had
escaped.
and
as
he
said
at
his
court-martial
trial,
and
i'm
referring
to
5
(a)
of
the
--
what
is
now
the
--
4
of
the
record,
“my
organization
is
now
in
italy.
i
thought
it
would
be
possible
for
me
to
rejoin
my
organization
and
there
i
might
get
a
brigade
commission
commander
that
would
reopen
my
case.
at
the
time
lieutenant
(inaudible)
picked
us
up,
we
had
decided
to
return
to
the
stockade.
the
going
was
tough.
we
had
no
money
to
speak
of
and
at
the
time
we
were
on
foot
and
we're
getting
cold
and
hungry.”
now,
that
was
a
technical
desertion
under
the
articles
of
war
because
he
was
absent
from
a
place
of
confinement
which
is
a
place
of
unpleasant
duty.
here,
of
course,
there
is
involved
no
question
of
dual
nationality.
no
question
whatever
of
foreign
relations.
there
is
the
bare
question
where
the
congress
has
the
power
to
deprive
a
native-born
american
of
his
citizenship
because
of
some
act
fully
unrelated
to
the
conduct
of
foreign
affairs.
an
act
serious
in
its
nature,
of
course,
but
for
which
other
punishment
has
been
provided
by
the
articles
of
law
--
of
war,
other
punishment
which
was
in
fact
imposed.
and
we
submit
that
there
is
nothing
in
any
of
the
decided
cases
which
so
much
as
suggest
this
power
in
the
congress.
that
all
of
those
cases
can
be
subsumed
under
general
heading
of
control
over
foreign
relations,
and
dealing
with
problems
that
might
arise.
now,
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief,
one,
in
our
original
brief
and
the
other
in
supplemental
brief,
two
possible
grounds
on
which
this
basic
constitutional
issue
could
be
avoided
by
this
court,
by
way
of
statutory
construction,
the
government
will
have
none
of
them.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes.
a
supplemental
--
a
short
supplemental
brief
was
filed
in
connection
with
the
--
the
reargument.
and
in
that
brief,
i
called
attention
of
the
court
to
a
point
of
construction
first
raised
by
three
students
of
the
yale
law
school.
when
that
institution
chose
this
case
as
the
case
to
be
argued
in
its
annual
moot
court
competition,
the
argument
which
was
held
up
at
new
haven
after
i
had
argued
this
case
originally
here
last
may.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
mr.
justice
douglas
was
the
--
sat
on
it.but
because
of
the
state
dinner
being
given
with
some
royal
dignitary
from
the
far
east
and
he
was
unable
to
come.
mr.
justice
stanley
reed
took
his
place.
the
other
two
judges
were
mrs.
sobeloff
and
bazelon
of
courts
of
appeals,
dean
griswold
of
the
harvard
law
school
and
mr.
harrison
tweed
the
chairman
of
the
commission
of
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yale
in
the
court.
yes.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well
--
but
the
point
that
was
raised
was
interesting
and
it
was
received
with
much
attention
by
those
judges
and
therefore
i
have
called
it
to
your
honor's
attention
here.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no,
they
don't
decide
the
merits.
they
only
--
of
the
cause
but
only
the
merits
of
the
debaters.
and
in
that
particular
case,
i
believe,
it
was
one
of
the
debater
--
of
the
presenters
for
the
government
that
was
awarded
upon
and
i
must
say
that
if
i
had
been
one
of
the
judges,
i
would
have
done,
likewise.
but
i
really
call
your
attention
to
these
issues
of
construction
because
they're
there.
i
don't
want
to
take
the
short
time
that's
available
to
deal
with
it.
and
i
must
admit
that
as
a
lawyer
and
a
citizen,
i
would
be
greatly
disappointed
if
the
case
were
decided
on
those
grounds
although
as
a
lawyer
for
my
client,
i
would
hope
that
if
the
case
couldn't
be
decided
on
any
other,
it
would
be
on
those.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
the
two
grounds
are
these.
one,
that
in
order
to
save
the
statute
from
constitutional
attack,
desertion
to
the
enemy
must
be
implicit
in
it.
of
course,
that
involves
a
problem
of
foreign
relations.
that
was
my
original
point.
the
yale
law
school
point
is
that
the
statute
requires
that
the
dishonorable
discharge
be
the
result
of
the
conviction
for
desertion.
here
was
a
single
sentence
imposed
on
pre-charges
for
each
one
of
which
dishonorable
discharge
was
a
possible
penalty
under
the
articles
of
war
and
therefore
no
one
can
say
for
which
of
them
the
penalty
was
imposed.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
one
of
them
was
certainly
of
a
minor
character,
absence
from
--
without
leave.
the
others
were
escapes
from
military
confinement
and
two
escapes
from
military
confinement
might
very
well
rank
as
much
more
serious
than
this
one
day
technical
desertion
which
really
was
not
a
desertion
in
the
popular
sense
at
all.
i'm
sure
if
anyone
were
asked
and
were
--
they
would
say
this
was
absent
without
leave
from
--
to
be
sure
from
a
military
confinement
rather
than
from
an
ordinary
camp.
but
there
was
nothing
here
which
indicated
any
attempt
to
get
away
from
obligation.
this
--
as
i
say,
the
–
the
soldier
himself,
within
a
day,
was
walking
back.
he
had
some
grievances
and
he
thought
that
he
might
get
better
attention
to
those
grievances
if
he
could
get
out
of
the
atmosphere
of
casablanca.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
that
is
a
conceivable
--
that
is
a
conceivable
proposition.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
however
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
i
have
raised
the
issues,
mr.
justice
and
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
all
right.
now,
to
greet
the
issue
head
on.
the
solicitor
general
has
already
indicated
that
he
believes
that
congress
has
the
power
to
decree
loss
of
nationality
as
an
inherent
attribute
of
sovereignty
in
a
number
of
situations.
i
will
not
quarrel
with
the
basic
thesis
that
congress
has
the
power
to
provide
conditions
upon
which
nationality
may
be
surrendered
or
even
under
certain
situations
to
indicate
that
unequivocal
acts
constitute
such
surrender.
but
i
say,
that
power
is
circumscribed
by
the
nature
which
gives
it
being,
since
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
whatever
which
deals
with
the
issue
other
than
the
fourteenth
amendment
declaration,
citizen
--
persons
born
are
citizens.
now,
what
is
it
--
the
basic
concept
which
gives
congress
the
implied
power?
it
is
the
fact
that
this
is
a
sovereign
nation
dealing
with
other
sovereign
nations.
and
the
question
of
nationality
may
under
circumstances
assume
importance
in
the
dealings
of
congress
or
the
executive
--
when
he
does,
with
other
nations.
and
the
congress
may,
therefore,
prescribe
certain
rules
of
conduct
which
facilitate
the
conduct
of
our
foreign
relation.
but
at
the
moment
you
go
beyond
that
basic
reason
for
the
existence
of
any
power
at
all,
the
power
ceases
to
exist.
and
therefore,
congress
does
not
have
the
power
which
the
government
in
his
brief
seeks
to
attribute
to
it,
namely,
to
decree
loss
of
nationality
where
a
citizen
does
something
which
congress
thinks
is
inconsistent
with
his
obligations
as
a
citizen.
that,
i
say,
is
wholly
outside
of
congressional
power.
and
i
say
that
the
same
result
is
accomplished
if
you
view
it
from
the
due
process
aspect.
in
my
brief,
i
have
viewed
it
from
both
and
it
doesn't
really
make
any
difference
because
as
i
say,
the
rational
connection
between
certain
acts
and
loss
of
nationality
must
inhere,
in
the
relation
of
those
acts
to
other
nationalities
and
not
in
the
heinousness
of
the
act
done.
there'd
be
an
ordinary
crime,
whether
it'd
be
an
election
crime,
whether
it'd
be
a
defiance
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
or
whatever
the
nature
of
the
act
which
is
considered
serious
and
worthy
of
punishment.
it
has
nothing
to
do,
no
matter
how
much
anyone
may
say
in
congress
or
in
the
pulpit
or
anywhere
else
other
than
i
hope
in
this
court
that
the
act
results
in
an
indication
of
abandonment
of
allegiance.
now,
how
does
that
apply
to
desertion
in
war
time?
desertion
in
war
time
is,
of
course,
a
serious
offense,
under
certain
circumstance,
punishable
by
death.
it's
probably
at
least
serious
in
the
particular
case
involved.
but
the
scope
of
a
statute
must
be
judged
by
the
least
as
well
as
the
most
serious
cases.
and
in
order
for
a
statute
to
be
saved
from
attack
on
constitutional
grounds,
it
must
be
properly
applicable
to
all
situations
which
might
arise,
which
parenthetically
is
an
objection
which
could
be
made
--
well
made
to
some
of
the
other
sections
of
the
statute
which
have
been
debated
here
today.
namely,
that
they
create
irrebuttable
presumptions
wherein
certain
of
the
situations
perhaps
in
most
of
them,
all
that
congress
should
have
done
was
to
create
rebuttable
presumptions,
namely,
that
certain
acts
might
indicate
such
allegiance
to
another
country
as
the
result
in
loss
of
nationality
leaving
it
to
the
courts
to
determine
the
general
boundary
under
certain
standards.
now,
here,
desertion,
bare
technical
desertion,
defined
as
leaving
the
post
of
unpleasant
duty
of
–
without
any
connections
to
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
without
any
contact
between
the
deserter
and
the
enemy
forces,
under
circumstances
where
such
contact
was
clearly
impossible
as
it
was
here
never
attempted,
i
say,
that
such
an
act
is
wholly
beyond
any
connection
between
foreign
relations
or
the
sovereignty
of
the
united
states
in
a
family
of
nations
as
distinguished
from
the
concepts
which
arise
domestically
between
a
government
and
the
conduct
of
its
citizens
which
might
justify
the
imposition
of
ordinary
criminal
penalties.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
the
only
evidence
here
is
what
was
testified
to
at
the
court-martial
which
is
accepted
in
the
appellant's
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
included
therefore
in
the
brown-covered
small
record
here.
and
all
that
the
government
added
to
that
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
here
was
a
copy
of
the
full
charges
and
judgment
of
conviction
and
the
sentence.
so
if
there
no
question
whatever,
about
the
facts,
and
as
our
excerpt
show,
the
testimony
of
the
witness
is
produced
by
the
government,
shows
that
this
man
was
walking
back
toward
casablanca
when
the
patrol
came
along
and
that
i
think
he
got
in
without
any
question.
he
was
driven
back
to
confinement
and,
of
course,
he
has
served
the
three
years
sentence
that
was
imposed
upon
him.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
i
assume
that
everyone
as
to
whom
a
dishonorable
discharge
resulted
was
expatriated.
now,
it
might
be
--
it
should
be
noted
here,
of
course,
that
congress
did
not
give
to
the
court-martial
any
discretion
with
respect
to
loss
of
nationality.
that
is
nothing
with
which
the
court-martial
concerned
itself
at
all.
these
provisions
are
not
in
the
articles
of
war.
they're
part
of
the
nationality
act
so
that
is
automatically
resulted
that
when
this
man
came
back
to
the
united
states,
after
release
from
confinement,
assuming
that
he
was
still
an
american
citizen.
and
then
for
business
reasons,
needed
a
passport
and
applied
for
one
--
he
was
told,
“no,
you've
lost
your
american
nationality”
and
this
lawsuit
followed.
now,
i
have
no
means
of
knowing
how
many
people
there
are
in
like
case.
of
course,
the
government
should
know.
i
don't
believe
it
has
disclosed.
i
assume
there
are
great
many.
and
we
say
that
that
is
simply
beyond
anything
which
earlier
cases
have
decided,
beyond
any
rationale
principle
which
can
be
applied.
and
whether
you
call
it
lack
of
power,
lack
of
due
process
or
an
attempt
to
inflect
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
as
judge
clark
concluded,
dissenting
below,
it
all
adds
up
to
the
same
single
result
that
this
is
not
something
for
which
congress
can
take
away
nationality
of
an
american-born.
i
would
like
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal
if
there
is
time.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
this
rather
hypothetical
account
of
what
trop
might
have
done
under
the
difficult
circumstances
of
1944
seems
to
me
wholly
out
of
place
in
this
case,
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
legal
principles
involved.
moreover,
i
think
it's
a
reconstruction
that
has
no
substance.
in
fact,
bear
in
mind
that
the
reviewing
authorities
criticized
the
leniency
of
the
three-year
confinement
at
hard
labor
in
this
case.
can
anyone
suppose
that
under
those
circumstances
they
would
have
yielded
to
importunities
to
sentence
the
--
remitted
altogether
and
he'd
be
sent
back
particularly
in
view
of
the
fact
that
before
the
court-martial,
he
testified
that
his
escape
was
motivated
by
his
desire
to
get
back
to
his
unit
who's
fighting
in
italy.
well,
i
will
leave
that
because
i
don't
think
it
touches
the
issues
in
this
case.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
i
would
say
yes.
i
would
say
there
was
a
lack
of
rational
connection
and
i
would
also
say
that
was
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
in
the
view
taken
by
judge
clark
in
the
second
circuit.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
not
as
such.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
we
--
well,
there
are
no
provisions
in
the
united
states
penal
law
which
contain
additional
penalties
involving
loss
of
citizenship
although
there
are
and
i
have
referred
to
them
in
my
brief,
quite
a
number
of
such
provisions
which
involve
loss
of
various
rights
such
as
the
right
to
hold
office.
there
are,
in
the
nationality
act,
a
number
of
sections
which
do
provide
loss
of
citizenship
following
convictions
for
certain
crimes
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
--
which
have
not
yet
come
before
this
court,
insofar
as
i
know,
have
never
yet
been
invoked.
conviction
of
advocacy
of
the
overthrow
of
the
government
under
the
smith
act
is
one
of
such
crimes.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
(voice
overlap)
no.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no,
no,
you're
not
wrong.
restoration
of
citizenship
rights
was
what
was
meant.
in
other
words,
that
brings
us
back
perhaps
to
the
semantics
of
the
statute
of
1865
which
spoke
of
the
loss
of
the
rights
of
citizenship
which
was
generally
interpreted,
meaning
the
loss
of
the
right
to
vote
and
to
hold
office.
although
there
are
other
authorities
as
the
solicitor
general
mentioned
yesterday
which
--
made
that
phrase
equivalent
with
the
loss
of
nationality.
now,
it
is
true
that
president
coolidge,
i've
been
informed,
signed
an
amnesty
act
dealing
with
the
deserters
in
world
war
i
which
purported
to
restore
to
them
the
nationality
which
they
may
have
lost
under
--
remnants
of
the
act
of
1865.
but
as
far
as
i
know,
no
case
has
yet
arisen
where,
as
the
result
of
conviction
for
crime,
a
person
has
lost
his
nationality
although,
as
i
said,
there
are
certain
provisions
of
law
which
it's
ultimately
sustained,
here,
when
they
do
become
tested
would
have
that
result.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
oh,
no.
this
was
a
very
recent
amendment
to
the
nationality
act,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
the
--
the
one
dealing
with
conviction
on
the
smith
act
is
one
of
the
latest
additions
to
the
nationality
act.
it
didn't
exist
in
the
nationality
act
of
1940
the
--
which
we
are
here
concerned.
i
want
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
oh
yes.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
oh
yes.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
hold
office
and
congress
has
a
considerable
control
over
a
determination
as
to
who
shall
hold
federal
office.
there
is,
we
submit,
a
constitutional
right
to
be
a
citizen.
and
the
control
of
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
i
have
always
doubted
the
interpretation
of
the
1865
act
which
had
anything
to
do
with
the
right
to
vote
but
that
was
never
tested
for
the
reason
parenthetically
that
in
the
first
place,
the
qualifications
for
the
right
to
vote
are
state
determined
and
they're
not
federally
determined.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
that's
right.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
i
say,
he
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes.
that
is
my
position.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no,
no.
but
it
does
equal
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
--
it
does
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
it
does
create.
it
does
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
it
does
create
a
condition
of
statelessness
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
--
list
in
the
situation
here
present
where
there
is
involved
no
connection
whatever
with
any
foreign
country.
banishment
is
an
additional
point
and
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
there's
a
whole
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
--
there's
a
whole
host
of
grounds
for
deportation,
of
course.
but
we're
not
involved
in
that
yet.
may
i
add
only
two
other
things
in
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
that's
right.
it
is
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
i
don't
know.
i
don't
see
it.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
in
my
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
--
my
innocent
--
i'm
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
i'm
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
deporting
is
another
matter.
but
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
--
as
far
as
being
an
alien
is
concerned,
my
--
my
innocence,
i
thought
a
person
was
either
a
citizen
or
an
alien.
he
couldn't
be
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
--
anything
in
between.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
about
the
stateless
because
he's
not
a
citizen
of
any
other
country.
but
he's
still
an
alien
in
respect
to
this
country,
two
other
things
briefly,
if
i
may.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
i'm
trying
now
unfortunately
with
this
white
light
staring
at
me
to
deal
with
it,
unless
i'm
given
a
few
minutes
indulgence.
as
to
the
statistics
which
are
on
the
brief
in
the
perez
case,
i
suggest
they
are
meaningless
because
i
believe
they
are
statistics
only
of
people
whom
the
lightning
struck,
that
is
people
who
applied
for
passports
so
were
accorded
the
boarders,
not
the
numerous
people
who
may
have
been
convicted
of
court-martial
for
desertion
and
given
dishonorable
discharges.
moreover,
i
think
it
should
be
kept
in
mind
that
i
doubt
whether
even
the
military
authorities,
many
of
them
realized
what
was
happening.
and
that
loss
of
nationality
would
result.
certainly,
the
soldier,
ordinary
soldier
knew
nothing
about
it.
and
finally,
reference
was
made
yesterday
to
the
so-called
trial
de
novo
under
503.
of
course,
trial
de
novo
is
a
misnomer.
there
is
a
judicial
hearing.
in
this
particular
case,
there
would
be
no
issue
of
fact
to
be
determined
at
the
hearing,
the
identity
of
the
individual
being
conceded.
all
of
the
facts
are
record
facts.
so
the
additional
hearing
would
deal
only
with
questions
of
law
which
we've
raised
and
which
fortunately
we're
able
to
present
here.so
that
it
isn't
a
trial
in
a
full
sense.
there
is
no
retrial,
for
instance,
of
the
issue
of
desertion.
that
is
determined
by
the
court-martial
conviction.
it's
not
open
under
503.
so,
we
--
as
to
the
war
power,
we
submit
the
war
power
in
this
context
is
no
greater
than
the
power
to
meet
our
criminal
justice
and
that
therefore
the
penalty
of
loss
of
nationality
has
no
rational
relation
with
the
conduct
of
the
armed
forces.
it
has
rational
relation
with
foreign
affairs
and
with
no
other
aspect
of
our
existence
as
a
sovereign
so
that
no
inherent
power
exists
to
deal
with
that
subject
outside
the
realm
of
international
relations
which
is
not
in
any
respect
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
as
i've
said,
president
coolidge
--
coolidge
purported
to
do
just
that
to
restore
nationality.
i'll
doubt
if
the
legal
effect
of
it
was
--
was
never
questioned.
i
doubted
for
the
reason
that
it
is
not
the
offense
for
which
the
disqualification
here
is
imposed
but
the
dishonorable
discharge
and
i
don't
know
any
pardoning
power
in
the
president
which
can
change
a
dishonorable
discharge
into
different
kind
of
discharge.
