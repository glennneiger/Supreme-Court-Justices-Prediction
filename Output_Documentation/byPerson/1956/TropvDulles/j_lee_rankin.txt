mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
regard
to
the
inquiry
as
to
other
cases,
mr.
justice
harlan,
we
note
that
in
the
perez
brief
in
the
appendix
on
page
62,
there's
a
tabulation
of
other
cases
and
says
other
grounds
for
the
report
in
1951
to
1956
and
it
isn't
broken
down
to
cover
all
the
various
--
or
to
cover
only
desertion
but
other
grounds.
there
are
40
for
1951,
2
for
1952
and
3
for
1953,
6
for
1954,
5
for
1955,
and
5
for
1956.
and
on
page
63,
there
is
a
report
of
the
commission
of
immigration
for
the
period
--
one-year
period
closing
june
30,
of
1950
and
is
broken
down
next
to
the
last
line
of
the
tabulation
there
to
show
the
desertion
from
the
armed
forces
in
war
time,
this
show
4
for
1949
and
4
for
1950.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
is
in
the
perez
brief.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
in
the
appendix
b
at
pages
62,
the
first
tabulation
i
referred
to
and
63
for
the
second.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there
was
--
no.
there
was
a
special
provision
in
the
statute
itself
though,
by
which
they
could
obtain
the
benefits
of
being
restored
and
it
goes
provided
and
that's
on
page
2
of
our
brief
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
that
notwithstanding
loss
of
nationality
or
citizenship
or
civil
or
political
rights
under
the
terms
of
this
or
previous
acts
by
reason
of
desertion
committed
in
time
of
war,
restoration
to
active
duty
with
such
military
or
naval
forces
in
time
of
war
or
the
reenlisting
or
induction
of
such
person
in
time
of
war
with
the
permission
of
competent
military
and
naval
authorities,
prior
or
subsequent
to
january
20th,
1944,
shall
be
deemed
to
have
the
immediate
effect
of
restoring
such
nationality
or
citizenship.
and
all
civil
and
political
rights
heretofore
or
hereafter
so
lost,
and
of
removing
all
civil
and
political
disabilities
resulting
therefrom.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
would
assume
that
they
reflect
--
that
those
persons
did
not
take
or
obtain
the
benefits
of
this
proviso
and
that
there
were
hundreds
and
possibly
thousands
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
who
did
take
the
benefits
of
this
proviso
and
–
and
proceeded
to
reenlist
or
be
reinducted
and
perform
their
duty
and
got
the
full
benefit.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
do
not
know
that
--
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
--
i
don't
think
it'd
be
fair
to
assume
that
they
are
entirely
--
because
the
other
possibility
is
there.
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
and
i'm
satisfied
with
the
reason
is
that
frankly
all
of
them
took
the
benefit
of
this
proviso.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
that's
on
page
2
of
our
brief.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
in
trop,
number
70
and
it's
(g)
in
about
six
or
seven
lines
down.
because
--
and
the
reason
i
draw
that
conclusion
or
make
that
deduction
is
that
the
country
was
having
great
trouble
with
this
problem
of
desertions
during
the
time
of
war
and
it
got
so
bad
that
the
president
issued
a
special
proclamation
taking
the
–
the
top
off
of
the
limitations
in
regard
to
the
penalties
so
that
it
could
be
the
penalty
for
desertion
could
be
even
death.
prior
to
that
there
was
a
statutory
limitation
that
the
president
had
the
power
to
remove
and
he
did
issue
such
a
proclamation.
and
certainly,
if
the
figures
were
as
small
as
indicated
by
62
and
63,
i
just
assume
that
the
government
wouldn't
be
bothered
about
taking
an
act
of
that
kind
by
the
president
during
time
of
war
with
all
of
the
other
problems
he
had
and
that
they
–
they
were
also
instructed,
all
of
the
commanders,
to
give
special
indoctrination
to
all
of
their
me,
telling
them
the
seriousness
of
this
offense.
and
the
--
the
penalties
that
would
flow
from
it
so
that
they
would
be
fully
advised
and
try
to
reduce
the
number
of
desertions
that
the
army
and
armed
services
were
experiencing,
so
that
it
had
become
a
very
serious
problem
to
our
government
during
this
period
as
exemplified
by
those
things.
now,
just
from
what
we
all
know
about
what
happened
during
the
war
time
period
and
the
problem
of
awl
--
awol
and
desertions
and
so
forth.
we
know
that
it
had
was
that
--
as
many
man
as
we
had
in
the
armed
services
to
run
into
thousands,
if
not,
many
thousands.
and
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
must
have
been
solved
by
this
proviso.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
it's
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
just
can't
answer
that
--
regarding
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
now,
whether
there
was
a
special
(voice
overlap)
enactment
after
that
to
make
similar
provisions,
we
haven't
--
because
it
wasn't
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
says
prior
or
subsequent,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
there
is
a
difference.
there
isn't
any
question
about
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
you
see,
you
have
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
there
were
two
escapes
involved
hereto
and
one
escape
was
from
confinement
which
would
be
much
more
serious
and
you
also,
it
seems
to
me,
have
to
take
into
account
the
--
the
condition
of
the
war
situation
at
that
time
and
the
fact
that
our
armed
forces
were
moving
into
the
italian
area
in
large
buildups
for
the
conflict
that
occurred
there
and
what
it
was
involved
in
this
kind
of
a
desertion.
now,
all
we
have
is
the
record
before
us
that
there
was
the
conviction
at
the
court-martial
for
this
desertion
and
for
the
two
escapes.
and
there
was
a
penalty
of
three
years.
and
then
it
was
reviewed
by
the
reviewing
authority
and
the
only
thing
they
found
was
that
it
wasn't
enough
in
this
case.
now,
that
shows
the
seriousness
of
how
it
was
regarded
by
the
reviewing
authority
at
that
time,
in
view
of
the
situation
that
was
present
in
the
whole
war
picture
with
this
great
build
up
in
italy
and
the
fact
that
very
shortly
thereafter
some
--
the
units
that
this
man
would
be
connected
with,
advanced
on
rome
and
undoubtedly,
what
must
have
been
in
the
mind
of
the
reviewers
was
the
situation
about
this
man
not
having
to
engage
in
combat
by
this
device.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
he
would
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
he
would
have
been
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
awo
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
awol
is
certainly
not
serious
like
desertion
and
wasn't
treated
by
the
articles
of
war
or
by
our
government
in
the
same
way.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
and
that
all
i
can
say
is
that
you
had
the
court-martial
and
you
had
to
review
it.
and
under
the
circumstances,
it
was
certainly
regarded
as
a
very
serious
matter
when
they
thought
that
the
three-year
penalty
for
the
desertion
was
not
sufficient
and
it
just
wasn't
enough,
the
man
would
have
gotten
off
if
he
hadn't
been
given
that
if
that
sentence
had
not
been
left
in
effect.
so
that
under
the
circumstances
here,
it
was
certainly
regarded
by
the
reviewing
authority
and
i
think
we
have
a
right
to
assume
they
fairly
examined
it,
tried
to
evaluate
it
from
the
light
of
the
circumstances
of
this
case
as
a
very
serious
matter.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
now,
we
do
not
think
there's
anything
to
the
point
about
desertion
to
the
enemy.
the
whole
circumstances
about
the
statute
and
its
adoption
did
not
lend
itself
to
that
kind
of
interpretation
or
the
conclusion
of
that
is
a
–
a
valid
assumption
regarding
the
statute.
in
the
first
place,
you
have
to
go
back
to
--
with
regard
to
the
statute,
to
1865
and
this
statute
in
some
respects
comes
down
through
the
years
for
around
100
years
when
the
country
has
felt
the
need
of
this
type
of
statute.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
1865
statute
affected
citizenship.
it
depends
upon
how
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
how
you
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
construe
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
government
thinks
that
it
did
and
that
that
was
how
it
was
construed
by
the
congress
but
it
has
also
been
claimed
to
affect
the
rights
of
citizenship
as
distinguished
from
expatriation
and
that
is
a
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
although
at
that
time,
the
important
rights
that
were
commented
on
were
the
right
to
hold
office
and
the
right
to
vote.
but
there
is
a
difference
in
the
way
it's
been
treated
in
the
legislative
history
throughout
the
various
debates
in
congress
and
they
have,
in
1912,
the
question
came
up
as
to
whether
it
should
be
changed
so
it
would
apply
only
in
war
time
and
not
in
peace.
and
during
that
debate,
there
was
much
that
--
much
of
the
comment
indicated
that
they
were
treating
it
as
though
it
was
expatriation
rather
than
depriving
the
citizen
of
his
rights
to
citizenship.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right,
under
section
503.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
--
the
trial
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
court-martial
and
dishonorable
discharge
and
then
it
would
follow
that
he
--
that
he
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
statute
doesn't
provide
as
to
a
jury.
it
does
provide
for
a
declaration
of
right
and
i
presume
you
would
go
back
to
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
as
to
what
the
process
would
be
in
regard
to
such
a
proceeding
and
there
are
provisions
under
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
for
submitting
factual
questions
to
a
jury
if
the
court
should
see
fit
in
many
circumstances.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
there's
a
special
statute
in
regard
to
this
particular
one
though.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
there's
--
there
are
situations
where
the
court
could
provide
a
jury
for
a
determination
of
disputed
facts
but
whether
or
not
in
this
situation
where
the
facts
aren't
in
dispute.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that
would
be
possible
there.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
there
are
some
provisions
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
provisions
on
the
rules
for
them
to
be
advisory
for
--
to
the
court.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
to
continue
my
argument
with
regard
to
the
trop
case,
i'd
like
to
first
say
that
the
authority
for
the
act
of
congress,
401
subsection
(g),
consists
of
the
war
power,
the
power
to
regulate
the
government
of
the
armed
forces,
a
power
to
raise
and
provide
for
the
support
of
the
armed
forces
and
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
as
it
modifies
those
various
powers.
turning
to
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
there
is
an
inherent
power
but
i
don't
think
it
--
it
has
the
same
problem
with
regard
to
foreign
affairs,
in
this
case,
that
there
is
in
perez
and
nishikawa
and
other
cases
before
the
court.
there's
certainly
the
inherent
power
to
conduct
the
affairs
of
the
united
states
as
a
sovereign
which
is
also
present.
turning
to
the
facts
on
page
4
of
the
transcript,
i'd
like
to
call
briefly
to
the
court's
attention
the
charge
three
that
was
involved
in
the
court-martial.
there,
it
has
stated
that
the
1st
lieutenant
dirr
(ph)
testified
that
on
may
23rd
of
the
year
1944,
and
you
will
recall
that
this
man
escaped
from
confinement.
it
wasn't
as
though
he
just
left
the
army
as
such.he
was
in
confinement
on
his
first
escape
on
may
9th,
1944,
that's
uncontradicted.
then,
after
he
was
brought
back
on
may
22nd,
he
again
escaped
and
that
was
the
time
that
the
desertion
charge
was
established
against
him.
now,
in
regard
to
what
happened
when
he
was
found
to
have
deserted,
1st
lieutenant
dirr
(ph)
testified
that
on
may
23rd,
he
was
in
a
truck
going
from
meknes
to
rabat
and
saw
plaintiff
who
was
hold
and
i
think
that's
typographical,
it
should
be
told
him,
he
was
from
the
hospital
and
he
and
a
companion
boarded
the
truck
and
were
turned
over
to
the
military
police
in
rabat.
now,
the
next
line,
i
think
is
important
to
our
thinking
about
this
charge
of
desertion
and
the
seriousness
of
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
he
was
from
the
hospital.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
and
he
and
a
companion
boarded
the
truck
and
were
turned
over
to
the
military
police
in
rabat.
they
got
in,
the
next
sentence
i
think
is
quite
important,
they
got
in
without
any
argument
and
made
no
attempt
to
leave
the
truck.
now,
i
don't
seem
to
think
that
that
language
is
open
to
the
construction
that
they
were
just
asked
to
be
taken
and
voluntarily
were
going
back
to
get
straightened
around
with
their
unit
because
there
wouldn't
be
any
reason
for
saying
that
they
got
in
without
any
argument
and
made
no
attempt
to
leave
the
truck
if
it
was
all
voluntary
at
that
time.
then
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
he
took
them
back.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
language
is
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
only
that
it
--
they
boarded
the
truck
and
were
turned
over
to
the
military
police
in
rabat.
so,
whether
he
was
treating
it
as
a
custody,
i
can't
tell
from
the
transcript.
then
the
technical
sergeant
helen
alcock
(ph)
testified
that
she
was
in
the
truck
and
that
plaintiff
and
another
"willingly
guarding
the
truck
although
nothing
was
said
and
that
they
were
walking
in
the
direction
of
rabat"
and
then
this
is
in
the
direction
of
casablanca
and
away
from
spanish
morocco.
then
the
plaintiff
himself
said,
"my
organization
is
now
in
italy,"
and
i
think
that's
very
important
in
regard
to
the
seriousness
of
this
charge
so
that
he
had
full
knowledge
of
where
his
organization
was
at
that
time.
“i
thought
it
would
be
possible
for
me
to
rejoin
my
organization
and
there
i
might
get
a
brigade
commander
that
would
reopen
my
case.
at
the
time
that
lieutenant
dirr
(ph)
picked
us
up,
we
had
decided
to
return
to
the
stockade.
the
going
was
tough.
we
had
no
money
to
speak
of,
and
at
the
time
we
were
on
foot
and
we
were
getting
cold
and
hungry."
that's
the
end
of
the
quote
and
that's
all
we
have
as
to
what
was
his
purpose
and
intention.
but
it
doesn't
appear
that
there's
any
clear
intention,
any
repentance
or
clear
intention
to
try
to
go
back
and
straighten
out
his
record
and
try
to
perform
his
duty
as
a
citizen
and
get
back
into
combat.
now,
if
you
take
into
account,
in
addition
to
that,
the
situation
that
was
present,
that
the
court
would
take
judicial
notice
of,
in
italy
in
regard
to
the
war,
we
find
that
the
axis
forces
had
been
defeated
in
africa.
the
fighting
in
italy
had
proceeded
and
naples
was
taken
october
1st,
1943
but
the
offensive
bogged
down
outside
of
cassino,
halfway
between
naples
and
rome
where
the
nazis
had
built
there
gustav
line.
now,
the
problem
was
to
bypass
this
enemy
stronghold
and
an
attack
was
launched
at
anzio
on
january
22nd,
1944.
but
the
american
and
british
troops
were
able
only
to
maintain
a
beachhead
there
due
to
heavy
nazi
bombing
and
shelling.
of
course,
we're
all
familiar
with
the
great
losses
that
were
suffered
on
that
beachhead.
throughout
february,
march
and
april
of
1944,
the
italian
fronts
remained
stabilized.
it
was
only
local
actions
taking
place.
then
on
may
11th,
after
several
weeks
of
extensive
air
--
aerial
bombardment,
the
allies
launched
their
spring
offensive.
cassino
was
captured
on
may
18th,
after
tough
and
bitter
fighting.
now,
if
you
relate
those
dates
to
that
kind
of
condition
in
italy,
for
he
knew
his
unit
was,
and
the
threat
to
life,
his
life
as
well
as
all
the
others
in
his
unit,
to
participating
in
that
combat.
i
think
you
get
the
picture
as
the
court-martial
looked
at
the
situation
when
they
examined
this
case
and
saw
that
this
man
was
absent
from
confinement,
first,
and
then
about
13
days
later,
may
22nd,
he
was
absent
again.
and
i
think
that
the
conclusion
is
very
fair
that
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
this
combat.
now,
you
take
into
account
the
shortage
of
manpower
that
we
had
in
this
country
and
the
demands
that
were
being
met
--
being
made
upon
our
armed
forces,
wherever
they
were
situated
in
the
world,
and
the
great
need
for
manpower
seems
to
me
you
also
must
take
into
account
the
fact
that
under
this
provision
of
section
401
(g),
it
was
provided
first
that
before
you
come
to
the
proviso,
there
was
an
opportunity
for
the
man
to
proceed
before
he
was
--
got
to
the
place
where
there
isn't
dishonorable
discharge
and
perform
his
obligation
of
citizenship
by
going
--
satisfying
his
superiors
in
going
back
to
his
unit
and
participating
in
combat
like
many
others
did,
who
were
also
involved
in
this
situation.
so,
being
absent
and
desertion
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
nothing.
we
don't
think
that
is
necessary
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
because
we
think
that
the
whole
history
shows
that
there
was
--
the
congress
wasn't
contemplating
anything
like
that.but
there's
nothing
to
show
that
he
was
deserting
for
the
enemy
that
he
was
trying
to
be
treasonable.
we
think
the
record,
well
supports,
the
position
that
he
didn't
want
to
fight
for
his
country
and
that
he
was
busy
trying
to
do
the
things
that
would
make
it
impossible
for
him
to
have
to
risk
his
life
on
behalf
of
this
country
but
not
to
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
record
doesn't
show
--
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
so
that
--
but
it
--
there's
no
question
that
what
this
--not
just
the
awol
case
where
a
man
leaves
if
he
can.
he
was
confined
because
of
the
action
and
i
--
there
isn't
any
question
but
what
the
record
show
that
it
was
--
he
was
properly
confined
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
at
least
there
isn't
any
charge
to
the
contrary.
and
so,
he
was
absent
from
a
confinement
as
distinguished
from
just
participation
in
his
army
duties.
and
then
in
addition
to
that,
we
have
the
fact
in
this
case
that
he
could
have
complied
with
the
proviso
as
many
thousands
did,
hundreds,
at
least,
in
which
he
could
have
been
restored
to
his
unit
if
he
wanted
to
and
satisfied
his
superiors,
carried
out
his
obligation
as
citizen.
and
there
--
thereby
recovering
his
citizenship.
now,
before
getting
to
the
proviso,
he
could
--
he
would
not
have
lost
his
citizenship,
at
all,
because
at
that
point
if
he
satisfied
his
superiors
and
returned
to
his
unit
and
fought
on
behalf
of
this
country,
he
never
would
have
lost,
because
there
would
not
have
been
a
dishonorable
discharge
at
that
point.
that
was
held
in
abeyance,
up
to
the
time
it
was
actually
entered.
and
if
you'll
recall,
the
section
requires
both
the
elements
of
conviction
for
desertion
by
a
trial,
by
military
trial
and
the
further
element
of
the
dishonorable
discharge.
and
there
were
many
that
were
restored
to
their
units
at
a
good
period
of
service,
established
their
satisfactory
military
action
and
were
not
given
dishonorable
discharge
at
all.
they
were
given
either
general
--
general
discharge
or
an
honorable
discharge.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
but
they
--
often
a
man
that
wanted
to
go
back
and
fight
during
a
period
when
the
country
needed
soldiers,
as
it
did
this
man,
at
this
time,
there
were
many
of
them
who
were
--
their
sentence
was
remitted
and
they're
put
back
in
their
unit
and
they
proceed
to
fight
on
behalf
of
their
country
and
made
a
good
record
and
got
honorable
discharge
or
a
discharge
--general
discharge
without
a
dishonorable.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
i
think
it
--
there
isn't
any
question
to
what
would
be
discretionary.
it
would
depend
on
his
willingness
his
satisfying
them
that
he
would
act
in
good
faith
and
would
not
be
detrimental
to
the
morale
of
the
rest
of
the
troops
that
he
was
with.
but
we
--
they
all
needed
men
at
that
time,
both
in
civilian
life
and
military
and
here
was
a
man
that
was
already
on
the
ground
and
the
practice
was
to
encourage
those
men
to
return
and
do
their
duties
for
other
countries
rather
than
have
them
confined
and
they'll
have
to
put
guards
on
them
and
increase
the
personnel
for
that
purpose.
so,
every
action
and
every
motive
on
--
of
the
army
at
that
time
was
to
get
him
back
into
his
unit
if
he
was
the
kind
that
wanted
it
at
all.
and
i
think
that
should
be
taken
into
account
in
considering
the
fact.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
doesn't.
it
is
just
a
--
the
way
everything
was
run
at
that
time.
i
think
you
should
take
judicial
notice
of
the
shortage
of
manpower
and
the
situation
and
the
fact
this
man
was
located
in
north
africa,
that
he
was
available
there
and
to
replace
him,
you'd
have
to
get
someone
else
moved
up
to
that
point.
but
this
was
a
staging
position
where
they
were
moving
in
to
combat,
according
to
the
record
that
we
all
know
about
the
action
in
italy,
and
therefore
his
particular
unit,
he
knew
was
in
italy
and
it
would
be
the
desire
to
get
him
there
to
help
in
the
fight.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
they
tried
to
rehabilitate
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
and
reinstate
him.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
in
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
they
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
refer
in
the
brief
to
the
history
of
this
proviso
and
the
reason
for
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
i
want
to
make
it
clear.
i
don't
claim
that
they
could
do
it
all
by
themselves.
they
had
to
satisfy
their
commanding
officers
that
they
were
or
could
be
rehabilitated.
but
the
history
in
congress
showed
that
that
was
the
purpose
of
this
proviso
to
make
it
possible
to
reinstate
these
men
rather
than
just
have
them
as
a
burden
upon
the
army
and
have
them
lose
their
citizenship
and
be
in
confinement
and
all
of
those
things.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
--
it
--
the
congress
dealt
with
it
in
the
history
of
the
--
the
legislative
history
pretty
carefully
and
we've
referred
to
it
in
our
brief.
so,
that
they
had
in
mind
these
numbers
of
--
large
number
of
desertion
cases
and
put
the
proviso
in
as
you
may
recall
in
the
legislative
history,
in
1944,
after
the
1940
act.
the
proviso
was
put
in,
in
1944,
for
the
purpose
of
taking
care
of
this
very
kind
of
situation.
and
so,
i
think
in
light
of
that,
you
have
to
take
into
consideration
the
--
the
fair
assumption
here
that
this
man
just
wasn't
subject
to
rehabilitation
and
didn't
want
to
be
rehabilitated.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
we
think
it's
open
to
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
construction.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
history
shows
thousands.
that's
all
that
i
--
that
it
was
referred
to
in
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh
yes.
it
was
so
serious
that
the
commanders
were
instructed
to
warn
all
the
soldiers
in
their
units
of
the
seriousness
of
it,
of
the
seriousness
of
the
penalties
for
it.
and
the
president
went
so
far
as
to
issue
a
proclamation
in
which
he
removed
the
tie
on
the
penalty,
the
penalty
that
could
be
imposed.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
so
it
was
possible
to
award
the
penalty
of
death.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
and
i'm
sure
that
president
roosevelt
when
he
did
that
didn't
do
it
without
regard
for
the
seriousness
of
the
situation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
haven't
inquired
but
i
could
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
if
the
court
would
like
to
have
me.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i'll
try
to.
