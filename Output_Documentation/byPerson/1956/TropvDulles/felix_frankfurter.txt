i
do
not
know,
you
probably
do,
whether
benedict
donald
became
a
citizen
of
--
of
great
britain
as
against
having
then
whatever
you
are,
a
citizen
of
new
york
there
before.
as
i
understand
you
--
what
are
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
he
did
not
become
a
citizen
of
great
britain?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
say
you
raised
doubt
whether
this
cannot
be
or
could
terminate
citizenship
with
order
to
implication
to
a
person
who
deserts
to
the
enemy,
out
of
whimsicality,
out
of
disapproval
of
--
of
our
participation
of
war,
for
any
reason
you
please.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
have
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
no
--
although
no
acquisition
or
desire
for
acquisition
of
--
of
citizenship
in
another
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
the
--
the
constitutional
position,
which
you
are
urging,
will
you
correct
me
if
i
misinterpret
it.
the
constitutional
position,
which
you're
urging,
is
that
it
is
for
a
citizen
who
wants
to
hang
on
to
his
citizenship
and
acquire
any
other
or
not
to
be
adrift
in
the
world
of
a
stateless
person.
it's
for
him
to
determine
the
extent
to
which
he
will
carry
out
any
of
the
implications
of
the
duty
of
citizenship.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
that's
what
i
meant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
for
him
to
determine
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
how
long
he
will
--
how
long
he
will
continue
whatever
he
may
deem
desirable
in
the
citizenship
of
the
united
states.
although,
it
is
for
him
to
determine
the
extent
to
which
he
will
carry
out
any
obligations
to
that
citizenship.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
--
you're
urging
us
the
cause.
of
course,
this
court
has
the
responsibility
of
deciding
whether
you're
right
or
wrong.
but
what
you're
urging
is,
is
it
fair
or
not
what
i
stated
a
minute
ago
that
it's
for
a
citizen
to
determine
how
long,
or
to
what
extent,
or
in
what
way
he
will
exercise
the
advantages
of
citizenship
and
for
him
to
determine
the
extent
to
which
he
will
rid
himself
of
those,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
an
attribution
that
may
not
be
to
the
fact.
you're
saying
it's
for
congress
to
attribute
to
him
a
purpose
which
he
hasn't
got.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
objective
which
is
retention
of
citizenship,
not
allegiance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
once
--
once
when
granted
term,
i'm
not
saying
you
are
wrong
mr.
fraenkel.
you
may
be
wholly
right.
i'm
trying
to
get
clarity
into
a
difficult
subject
for
myself,
not
to
you
or
for
others.
and
if
one
talks
and
it
must
be
assumed
and
it's
in
the
area
that's
likely
you're
dealing
with
fictions,
with
things
that
maybe
opposed
to
reality.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
you
may
attribute
that
kind
of
things
in
congress,
why
can't
i
attribute
other
purposes
to
congress
that
have
relation
to
the
ultimate
thing,
namely,
shall
you
continue
to
enjoy
citizenship?
the
constitution
doesn't
say
a
thing
about
allegiance.
the
constitution
doesn't
say
a
thing
about
any
of
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
constitution
merely
says
that,
“a
man,
who's
born
in
the
united
states,
is
born
in
the
united
states
and
ipso
facto
becomes
a
citizen.”
and
as
i
understand
it,
subject
to
correction,
there
is
no
difference
between
a
naturalized
and
natural-born
citizen,
except
he
can't
become
president
of
the
united
states
and
i
assume,
vice-president
of
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
raise
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
noticed
he
did.
it's
a
very
dubious
problem
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
whether
congress
would
say
it
will
make
you
a
citizen
and
look
but
the
10
years
interest
is
still
as
good
man
as
you
are
today.
that
raises
a
very
familiar
series
of
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
possibly,
i
have
a
personal
interest
in
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
importing
that
term
into
the
constitution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
citizenship
isn't
an
obstruction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
isn't
an
obstruction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
citizenship
has
contents.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
suggest
that
allegiance
doesn't
mean
merely
putting
your
hand
to
your
heart
when
the
star-spangled
banner
is
played.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
fraenkel,
you
need
not
be
reminded.
among
the
most
difficult
of
all
the
problems
that
came
before
president
lincoln
that
was
compassionate
of
states
was
what
to
do
with
desertions,
not
to
be
enemy
but
this
kind
of
desertion
because
that's
all
--
if
enough
people
do
that,
there's
no
country.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
those.
i'm
talking
about
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
cases
that
came
before
lincoln
when
he
was
appealed
to
for
president
because
a
fellow
fell
asleep
at
the
post.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
very
common
thing
in
war,
i
take
it
or
it
is
common
enough.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
--
the
declaratory
judgment
--
the
judgment
which
is
before
us,
either
for
confirmation
or
reversal
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
he
is
not
citizen.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
but
is
the
starting
point.
he
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
not
a
citizen,
and
therefore,
subject
to
the
immigration
laws,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
that
wasn't
the
suggestion
merely.
the
suggestion
was
he
may
be
subject
to
the
immigration
law
and
on
some
other
counts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
suggest,
as
i
understood
mr.
fraenkel,
he
was
merely
pointing
out
the
potential
dangers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
i
--
but
he
is
subject
to
the
immigration
laws?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
about
him
--
i
don't
want
to
--
like
a
stateless
person.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know
he
can
stay
but
he
can't
--
but
when
he
comes
in,
he's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
--
do
the
stateless
persons
resident
of
the
united
states
have
anything
like
an
nansen
passport?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
davis,
was
there
much
of
a
congressional
history
about
the
1865
act?
and
if
so,
you
made
reference
to
it
in
your
--
in
your
brief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
proposed
that,
the
drastic
--
the
drastic
stanton?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
--
mr.
davis,
do
you
mean
to
suggest
though
that
pardoning
automatically
carries
with
it
the
restoration
of
citizenship,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
as
a
matter
of
no
importance,
but
i
think
if
the
president
has
usually
stated
it
in
pardon
with
full
restoration
of
the
citizenship,
i
think
the
records
in
the
department
of
the
attorney
general
who
reports
that
each
year.
there
is
that
provision,
there
is
usually
a
--
or
an
addition
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
it
isn't
in
the
statute,
if
the
statute
doesn't
make
that,
then
whatever
the
consequences
follow
a
pardon
or
the
normal
consequences
in
regard
to
presidential
pardons
generally.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
choice
to
counterfeiters,
any
federal
offense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
the
exercise
of
the
pardoning
power
is
that
power
to
accomplish
retroactivity,
the
lack
of
talk
in
the
case
about
wiping
it
out
just
as
he
could
nullify
judgment.
certainly,
the
united
states
has
no
power
to
nullify
a
judgment.
that
he
could
wipe
out
as
such.
however,
i
don't
think
your
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
makes
no
difference
unless
by
using
the
word
“punishment”,
you
imply
that
we
drag
in
provisions
of
the
bill
of
rights.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
talking
about
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
talking
about
the
difference
between

worries
about

told,

don't
