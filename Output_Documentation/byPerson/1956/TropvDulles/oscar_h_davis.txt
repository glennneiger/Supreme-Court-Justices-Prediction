mr.
oscar
h.
davis
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
began,
because
the
petitioner
asked
for
a
passport
from
the
state
department,
and
was
refused
a
passport
on
the
ground
that
he
was
not
an
american
national.
it
does
not
involve
any
issue
of
deportation.
the
record,
which
is
before
this
court,
does
not
mention
the
facts,
which
mr.
fraenkel
just
stated
as
to
possible
deportation,
and
i
frankly
do
not
know
whether
they
are
true
or
not
because
the
record
does
not
even
show
how
this
man
came
back
to
the
united
states.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
he
is
not
a
citizen.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but
that
does
not
automatically
make
him
deportable.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
--
that's
right.
the
only
thing
i
was
trying
to
point
out,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
is
that
congress
has
not
passed
a
statute,
which
says,
“that
any
person
who
becomes
expatriated
shall
be
deported.”
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
that's
right
but
i
am
not
certain
that
he
is.
i
do
not
know
and
the
record
that
not
bare
or
have
any
light
on
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
there
is
a
potential
danger
but
it
is
not
certain,
at
least
on
this
record.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
do
not
have
them
available,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
--
i
hazard
the
assertion
and
i
think
it's
substantially
correct
that
deserters
within
the
united
states,
in
fact,
even
most
deserters
abroad,
were
restored
to
duty
after
a
period
of
--
of
disciplinary
training
at
--
in
one
of
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
they
do.
i
would
point
out
further
in
--
in
part
of
my
colloquy
with
justice
frankfurter
that
they
would
not
be
subject
to
deportation.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
they
are
stateless
citizens
as
a
person
who
renounced
his
citizenship
in
the
united
states
would
be.
many
japanese-americans
during
the
war
renounced
their
citizenship.
a
great
many
of
those
have
been
set
aside
as
done
under
duress,
but
some
of
them
have
not.
and
as
to
those
who
have
not
been
set
aside,
those
which
have
not
been
set
aside
under
duress
--
as
under
duress
and
who
are
not
also
japanese
nationals,
they
are
stateless
persons.
garry
davis,
the
well-known
personality
is
a
stateless
person,
though,
he
now,
i
think,
lives
in
the
united
states.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
garry
davis
is
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
if
he
doesn't
leave
the
united
states,
he
would
not
be,
unless
--
unless
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
would
--
yes,
i
think
that's
the
theory
that
serves
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
--
that
is
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
they
--
they
could
get
some
kind
of
identification
in
the
state
department
but
it
may
very
well
be
that
they
would
be
denied
entry
on
coming
back,
unless
they
had
some
papers
from
some
other
country.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
do
not
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
know
--
i
don't
know,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
the
facts
of
the
case
which
appear
only
from
the
record
are
--
i'd
like
to
state
them
a
little
more
in
detail
as
mr.
fraenkel
did.
the
petitioner
was
in
the
army
and
he
went
with
his
unit
to
casablanca
in
north
africa.
there,
in
march
of
1944,
he
committed
some
offense
for
which
he
was
tried
and
convicted
by
a
general
court
martial.
the
record
doesn't
indicate
what
it
was,
but
it
was
sufficiently
serious
so
that
he
could
be
tried
and
convicted
by
general
court
martial
and
he
was
confined.
he
was
transferred
to
the
station
hospital.
and
on
may
9,
he
escaped
from
the
station
hospital,
and
either
came
back
or
was
apprehended
shortly
thereafter.
and
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
on
may
9th?
i'm
not
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
know.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
on
may
9th,
i
don't
know
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
record
show,
i
believe.
it
shows
that
he
returned.
on
may
22nd,
he
escaped
again.
he
claims
that
he
surrendered.
we
do
not
have
the
full
court
martial
proceedings,
but
even
he
did
surrender,
he
indicates
that
he
did
because
he
was
tired
and
cold,
and
we
were
having
a
tough
time
on
foot
and
the
going
was
getting
tough.
that
--
so
he
--
he
came
back
into
military
custody,
i
think
on
may
23rd
and
he
was
convicted
by
a
general
court
martial
and
sentenced
to
three
years
confinement,
and
also,
to
have
a
dishonorable
discharge.
the
convening
authority
affirmed
the
sentence,
although,
it
said
it
was
inadequate
but
it
suspended
the
execution
of
the
dishonorable
discharge
until
release
from
confinement.
now,
section
401
(g),
which
is
involved
in
this
case,
has
a
restoration
provision.the
court
will
find
it
on
page
2
of
the
government's
brief.
this
restoration
provides
that
if
you
--
at
first,
i
should
say
that
the
loss
of
nationality
is
a
result,
not
only
of
conviction
for
desertion
by
a
court
martial,
but
also,
the
execution
of
the
dishonorable
discharge.
it
does
not
occur
until
the
execution
of
the
dishonorable
discharge,
and
it
also
provides
that
if
you're
restored
to
duty
during
time
of
war,
you
shall
not
lose
your
citizenship.
this
petitioner
was
not
restored
to
duty
and
we
don't
know
why.
one
can
only
guess
on
the
basis
of
this
record
which
indicates
that
the
unit
which
he
left
or
from
which
he
was
taken
because
of
his
crime
was
then
engaged
in
fighting
in
italy
in
the
spring
of
1944.
possibly,
perhaps,
his
two
escapes
from
confinement
within
the
short
time
and
possibly
his
--
his
activities
and
conduct
during
confinement,
but
actually,
we
don't
know.
the
statute,
401
(g),
goes
back
like
the
draft
evasion
statute,
which
is
being
discussed
yesterday
to
the
act
of
1865,
the
act
which
was
passed
in
march
of
1865.
and
one
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
questions
to
mr.
fraenkel
evoked
in
my
mind
a
bit
of
history,
which
i
believe
should
be
given
to
the
court.
that
act
was
passed
at
a
time
when
this
confederacy
was
collapsing.
there
was
no
fear,
no
large
fear
that
the
northern
soldiers
would
desert
the
confederacy.
there
was
a
great
deal
of
fear
that
they
would
desert
to
canada
or
go
home
before
the
--
the
war
had
been
completed.
that
was
the
theory
which
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
enacted
the
statute
which
provided
for
loss
of
citizenship
for
draft
evasion
and
desertion.
and
it
wasn't
at
all
related
to
fear
that
these
people
would
desert
to
the
enemy,
to
the
confederacy.
it
was
a
fact
that
they
would
--
that
the
army
would
collapse.
that
there
wouldn't
be
any
people
left,
unless
this
people
continued
to
serve
in
the
army,
as
they
should
until
peace
was
finally
declared
and
they
were
released
in
orderly
fashion.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
we
have
not.
there
isn't
very
much
and
--
but
we
haven't
even
made
reference
to
the
--
the
formal
indications
in
--
in
the
congressional
record
of
those
(inaudible).
on
the
face
of
it
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i'm
unable
to
say,
mr.
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
i
would
suggest
that
the
basis
of
--
of
history
that
that
would
mean
that
he
would
be
restored
to
a
nationality.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
it
does
not.
it
does
not
now
cover
it
expressly.
it
didn't
even
before
under
the
1865
act,
but
there
is
a
bit
of
history
on
that,
as
i
mentioned
yesterday,
when
the
statute
was
amended
in
1912
to
provide
--
so
that
it
wouldn't
be
operative
for
desertions
and
draft
evasion
in
peacetime.
congress
at
the
same
time
provided
that
the
president
could
pardon
those
previously
subjected
to
the
act
who
had
been
found
guilty
of
draft
desertion
or
draft
evasion
or
desertion
during
peacetime.
that
was
the
specific
provision
regarding
to
peacetime
persons.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
not
ordinary
pardoning
but
i
think
--
at
least,
i
have
the
authority
of
secretary
of
war
stimson,
who,
when
he
proposed
this
provision
in
1944,
said
that
the
citizenship
could
be
restored
by
pardon
as
it
was
done
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
by
--
by
president
coolidge.
in
fact,
fill
out
a
detail
to
us.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
i'm
--
i'm
talking
about
a
pardon
related
directly
to
this
particular
statute.
in
1920
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
i
don't
think
it
is.
it's
a
disability
and
i
think
that
the
president
has
the
power
to
relieve
from
disability
just
as
well
from
those
things,
which
are
--
are
punishments
in
a
criminal
sense.
in
1924,
president
coolidge,
as
i
think
i
mentioned
yesterday,
did
pardoned
those
deserters
who
deserted
after
the
armistice
of
1911.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
and
i
--
that's
why
i
stated
it
in
--
in
a
potential
sense
that
i
did
because
there
is
some
history
and
it
is
not
been
not
affirmatively
decided
by
this
or
by
any
other
court.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
--
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
but
i'm
suggesting
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
president
can
do
both,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
suggest
that
he
may
be
able
to
do
both,
that
he
can
restore
the
rights
of
citizenship
in
relation
to
voting
and
the
other
things
but
that
he
may
also
be
able
to
restore
citizenship
itself
as
i
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
i
meant
to
say
that
there
was
this
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
if
i
did,
i
didn't
make
myself
clear.
i
meant
to
say
that
what
he
--
that
--
that
the
power
that
he
was
exercising
was
a
power
which
was
directed
to
these
specific
provisions,
the
draft
evasion
and
desertion
statute.
and
in
relation
to
those,
he
may
have
a
greater
power
than
he
would
have
or
he
may
be
able
to
exercise
a
greater
power
than
he
ordinarily
does
in
other
cases.
and
as
i
said
that
secretary
of
war
stimson,
when
he
proposed
the
restoration
provision
in
1944
said,
"citizenship
may
be
restored
by
presidential
pardon,
granted
in
each
individual
case
or
by
proclamation
as
it
was
done
by
the
pardon
proclamation
of
president
coolidge.”
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
--
that
may
be
so,
but
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
i
--
i
don't
feel
that
my
case
depends
upon
--
on
this
suggestion.
i'm
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
i
said
--
i
said
that
i
believe
that
it
could,
that
it
hadn't
--
that
there
had
been
no
determination
about
it.
i
present
the
--
the
facts
of
history
in
which
there
--
of
president
coolidge
and
of
secretary
stimson
thought
that
it
could
be.
you
--
one
can
say
that
the
presidential
power
is
broad
enough
so
that
he
can
do
away
with
it
and
grant
amnesty
against
any
disability,
which
has
been
imposed
by
law
of
congress,
and
if
that
is
so,
then
the
presidential
power
extends
that
far.
if
it
does
not
extend
that
far,
then
of
course
he
could
not
restore
citizenship.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
yes,
but
the
president
can
of
course
pardon
others
who
weren't
american.
he
can
pardon
the
aliens
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
i
--
i
don't
think
that.
i
would
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
may
--
it
may
be,
i
am
not
certain
if
--
i
think
that's
a
much
weaker
case
because
there,
there
has
been
no
--
what
the
president
would
be
doing
here
would
be
wiping
out
in
a
sense
or
--
or
wiping
out
the
consequences
of
a
conviction
for
desertion
and
the
statute
says
that
a
dishonorable
discharge,
plus
a
conviction
of
desertion
leads
to
loss
of
nationality.
that
would
not
--
they
would
not
be
that
--
those
factors
in
the
case
you
mentioned.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
now
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
suggest,
sir,
that
there
is
a
possibility
that
that
is
so.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
power
to
pardon.
i
suggest
that
that
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
that's
right
but
if
disability
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
a
disability
has
been
imposed
upon
him.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
am
not
certain
of
this,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
don't
think
that
this
--
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
rests
upon
it.
in
answer
to
a
question
from
the
bench,
i
tried
to
give
whatever
history
there
was
on
--
on
the
subject
with
relation
to
this
particular
statute,
the
1865
statute
as
to
which
it
has
been
exercised.
i
--
i
might
mention
the
same
connection
that
congress
is
aware
that
--
that
these
various
expatriation
statutes
may
very
well
lead
to
harsh
consequences
because
both
after
world
war
i
and
after
world
war
ii,
it
has
passed
special
ameliorative
legislation.
the
president
have
passed
a
special
statute,
saying
that
“any
person
who
voted
in
a
--
in
a
foreign
country
which
was
not
an
enemy
country,
could
get
his
citizenship
back
by
a
short-form
naturalization
proceeding
if
he
did
it
within
one
year
of
august
15th,
1946.
petitioner
perez,
in
the
first
of
these
cases,
could
have
wiped
--
got
--
if
voting
abroad
had
been
his
only
act
of
expatriation
could
have
become
re-naturalized
or
naturalized
under
that
provision
if
he
had
made
application
for
it.
there
had
also
been
provisions
for
those
who
had
served
in
the
armed
forces
of
non-enemy
countries.
it's
a
short
form
naturalization
proceedings
for
those
who
have
served
in
the
armed
forces
of
--
of
non-enemy
countries,
that
of
course
does
not
include
italy,
japan
and
germany.
and
there
was
this
special
statute
for
those
who
voted
after
the
war
in
the
elections
in
italy
and
in
japan.
these
special
statutes
are
on
the
books
and
they
have
been
availed
of
by
a
great
many
people
who
lost
their
nationality.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
understand
there
was
some
indication
of
that.
the
case
--
cases
before
the
court
now
do
not
involve
that
act,
do
not
involve
even
the
--
of
the
act
of
--
of
1952.
they
involved
the
act
of
1940
as
to
which
there
are
no
similar
--
there
is
no
similar
history
and
particularly,
with
relation
to
this
statute,
the
section
of
the
statute
which
is
now
before
the
court,
401
(g).
i
should
--
i
should
--
i
believe
i
should
point
out
to
the
court
that
as
passed
in
1940,
the
statute
provided
simply
that
anyone
who
deserted
the
military
or
naval
force
of
the
united
states,
provided
he
was
convicted
by
a
court
martial
should
lose
his
nationality.
in
1944,
the
war
department,
mostly
because
of
the
--
a
man
who
deserts
the
armed
forces
in
this
country,
as
mr.
justice
brennan
mentioned,
came
to
congress
and
asked
that
the
statute
be
changed,
so
that
it
--
going
to
effect
only
when
the
--
a
dishonorable
discharge
was
executed
and
to
provide
the
provision
for
restoration
which
is
printed
in
the
government's
brief
at
page
2.
and
this
statute
was
enacted
at
that
time.
this
particular
restoration
provision,
i
think,
in
and
of
itself
shows
the
whole
--
entire
inadequacy
of
petitioner's
view
that
this
statute
should
be
limited
to
desertion
to
the
enemy.
there
are
various
grounds
for
rejecting
that
interpretation.
it's
completely
unpermissible.
it
is
not
within
the
bounds
of
--
of
appropriate
interpretation
of
the
statute.
first
place
as
i
said,
the
parent
statute,
the
1865
statute
shows
from
its
history
that
it
was
related
to
desertions,
not
to
the
enemy
but
to
home
or
the
country.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
and
i
think
he
has
two
arguments.
one,
that
it's
invalid,
but
if
it
is
not
invalid,
it
should
to
be
interpreted
as
relating
only
to
desertions
to
the
enemy
and
as
that
--
in
that
respect
would
not
apply
to
the
petitioner
here
who
did
desert
to
the
enemy.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
i
think
he
would
say
that
because
of
the
constitutional
doubt.
the
court
should
restrain
--
construe
the
statute
as
relating
on
desertion
to
the
enemy.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
but
i
--
i
would
try
to
point
that
this
is
one
of
those
cases
in
which
the
court
cannot
accept
that
alternative
because
the
countervailing
arguments
are
so
strong
that
the
statute
cannot
be
interpreted
in
that
way.
and
i'd
like
if
i
may
to
run
through
them
with
these
various
arguments
that
we
think
they
are
very
strong.
the
first
is
the
--
the
basic
historical
one
that
the
parent
statute
did
not
relate
only
to
desertions
to
the
enemy.
the
second
is
the
fact
that
the
statute
relates
to
desertion,
which
is
a
military
crime,
talks
about
the
conviction
by
a
court-martial.
now,
in
military
law,
desertion
is
wholly
--
desertion
to
the
enemy
is
wholly
irrelevant.
the
whole
--
the
whole
question
is
whether
you
have
deserted
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states
and
it
is
not
part
of
the
crime
at
all
that
you
went
over
to
the
enemy
or
you
didn't.
and
when
congress
refers
to
the
term
which
were
--
since
the
beginning
of
our
country
has
been
known
in
military
law
and
uses
--
says
that
a
conviction
by
a
court-martial
shall
be
adequate
conviction
for
this
crime.
it
must
be
referring
to
the
military
crime
of
desertion,
which
does
not
refer
desertion
to
the
enemy.
and
second,
there's
the
--
third
rather,
there
is
the
provision
for
restoration,
which
i
mentioned
just
a
few
moments
ago.
if
the
statute
were
limited
to
desertion
to
the
enemy,
it
would
be
highly
unlikely
that
there
would
be
any
provision
for
restoration,
because
any
man
who
deserted
to
the
enemy
would
be
highly
unlikely
to
come
back
to
the
forces
of
the
united
states,
and
if
he
did,
it
would
be
highly
unlikely
that
anyone
want
to
restore
him
to
service.
so,
the
whole
provision
for
restoration
wouldn't
make
sense,
even
if
one
didn't
look
at
the
legislative
history,
which
i'll
come
to
in
a
minute.
it
wouldn't
make
sense
at
all
if
the
statute
were
initially
limited
to
desertion
to
the
enemy.
and
the
forth
factor
is
that,
if
this
were
a
statute
with
limited
to
desertion
to
the
enemy,
it
would
be
equivalent
to
treason
provision.
and
there's
another
provision
in
the
statute,
providing
for
loss
of
nationality
for
treason,
that's
section
401
(h),
and
if
--
if
mr.
fraenkel's
view
of
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
were
correct,
there
would
hardly
be
any
difference
between
401
(g),
the
desertion
statute
and
401
(h),
the
treason
statute.
another
factor
is
that
congress
specifically
provided
in
this
nationality
act
of
1940
that
most
of
the
acts
of
expatriation
would
not
take
effect
with
respect
to
loss
of
nationality,
unless
they
are
performed
abroad
or
the
person
went
abroad.
it
--
it
made
some
exceptions
to
that
and
one
of
the
specific
exceptions
made
was
this
provision
401
(g),
relating
to
desertion.
it
specifically
provided
that
except
as
provided
in
subsection
(g)
and
so
forth,
expatriation
shall
not
result
until
you
go
abroad
or
an
act
is
done
abroad.
and
that
fact
indicates
very
clearly
that
they
were
referring
to
desertions
within
the
united
states,
and
of
course,
it
was
highly
unlikely
that
desertions
to
the
enemy
would
occur
within
the
united
states.
and
fourth,
and
perhaps,
most
persuasive
of
all
is
the
legislative
history
of
the
restoration
provision
which
was
enacted
in
january
1944,
in
which
--
to
which
we
have
referred
at
page
9
of
our
brief
in
this
case.
that
makes
it,
i
think,
irrefutably
clear
that
congress
was
concerned,
not
with
man
who
deserted
to
the
enemy,
which
at
that
time
there
were
very
few.
but
if
the
great
large
mass
of
soldiers
who
were
deserted
in
this
country
from
training
camps
and
so
forth
or
who
were
deserted
from
training
camps
in
england
or
abroad
and
they
were
--
they
were
interested
in
making
sure
that
these
people
would
not
lose
their
nationality
and
that
they
would
be
--
if
they
were
competent
able
fellows
would
be
restored
to
duty.
and
it
--
i
think
it
is
impossible
to
read
that
legislative
history
and
to
conclude
that
this
section
401
(g)
as
it
stood
at
the
time
it
--
it
affected
this
petitioner
could
possibly
be
construed
as
limited
only
to
desertion
to
the
enemy.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
it
would
depend
upon
the
nature
of
the
crime.
i
think
--
as
i
said
yesterday
that
it's
--
it's
a
question
of
when.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
can't
give
a
category
glance,
mr.
justice
brennan,
because
it
depends
upon
how
--
what
one
considers
to
be
the
obligations
of
citizenship,
the
prime
obligations
of
citizenship.
i
think
congress
can
provide
that
conviction
of
a
civil
crime
for
invading
or
avoiding
the
prime
obligations
of
citizenship
can
lead
to
loss
of
nationality,
as
it
did
in
the
draft
evasion
statute
which
is
under
discretion
yesterday.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
am
not
certain
and
i
cannot
say
that
that
is
a
prime
obligation
of
citizenship.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
again,
one
would
have
to
weigh
the
rationality
of
a
judgment
based
upon
the
materials
which
were
before
congress
and
on
which
it
acted
of
the
conclusion
that
an
election
fraud,
a
person
who
commits
an
election
fraud
has
violated
one
of
the
cardinal
or
one
of
the
prime
obligations
of
--
of
citizenship.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
i
don't
have
that
case
here.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
if
--
if
that
conclusion
is
raised,
then
i
think
that
there
is
power
in
congress
to
impose
laws
of
nationality
on
someone
who
has
committed
that
kind
of
--
that
kind
of
crime.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
particular
conduct
because
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
in
the
case
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
in
the
other
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
there
are
two
factors.
one,
that
congress
can
take
into
account
in
the
field
of
citizenship
two
general
sets
of
factors.
one
is
relations
with
foreign
countries
and
the
things
that
lead
to
embroilment
with
foreign
countries,
things
that
may
lead
to
clash
of
nationality,
clash
of
allegiance.
that's
one
set
of
--
set
of
factors.
the
other
--
the
second
set
of
factors
are
those
things
which
are
inconsistent
with
the
cardinal
or
prime
elements
of
american
citizenship.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
there
were
--
there
were
certain
things
said
in
the
1954
debates
which
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
there's
nothing
inconsistent
with
what
i
have
said.
we
are
not
saying
that
loss
of
nationality
is
a
penalty.
we
are
saying
it
is
a
disability,
a
consequence
which
congress
has
imposed
as
a
result
of
a
conviction
in
this
case
for
a
desertion.
and
i
think
that's
what
senator
mccarran
was
saying
there
because
he
was
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
senator
mccarran
was
in
that
particular
situation,
the
sponsor
of
a
bill,
which
did
seem
to
deprive
of
nationality,
people
who
have
been
convicted
of
violations
of
the
smith
act,
which
is
a
civil
crime.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
but
the
act,
i
believe
as
--
as
enacted
was
satisfactory
to
him
and
it
did
provide
that
a
person
who
was
convicted
of
violation
of
the
smith
act
should
lose
his
nationality
perspectively,
not
retroactively.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
there
is
a
problem
--
no,
as
far
as
civil
or
military
trial,
no,
i
do
not,
mr.
justice
black.
i
think
for
the
crime
of
desertion,
which
is
a
military
crime
a
court-martial
conviction
is
--
is
due
process
and
has
always
been
considered
as
such
throughout
our
history.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
would
not
agree
it's
punishment,
but
the
consequence
--
the
consequence
follows
from
the
conviction,
and
if
the
conviction
is
adequate
and
is
sustained
and
there
is
a
review,
as
the
court
knows
from
the
cases
which
were
recently
argued.
if
the
conviction
is
sustained,
i
think
there
is
no
constitutional
objection
to
congress
imposing
loss
of
citizenship
as
a
result
of
that
conviction.
now,
this
as
i
say
was
done
in
1865.
the
statute
of
1865
did
not
say
anything
about
conviction.
it
was
interpreted
by
this
court
as
to
--
to
impose
loss
of
citizenship
upon
conviction
by
court-martial
and
--
but
kurtz
against
moffitt
case
in
--
in
which
mr.
justice
breyer
wrote
the
opinion,
refers
--
make
this
clear
that
it
could
only
be
conviction
by
a
court-martial
which
lead
to
the
loss
of
citizenship,
because
only
a
court-martial
would
have
jurisdiction
of
the
crime
of
desertion.
so,
i
think
that
added
to
whatever
we
can
say
here
as
a
de
novo
matter,
there
is
the
--
the
clause,
the
very
witty
clause
of
92
years
of
history.
and
that
particular
statute
was
in
effect,
as
i
say
in
the
closing
months
of
the
civil
war.
it
was
in
effect
during
world
war
i
and
the
present
statute,
401
(g)
--
section
401
(g),
it
was
in
effect
during
world
war
ii.
so
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
do
not
know,
mr.
justice.
there
was
a
--
it
was
a
large
act
and
this
is
one
section,
section
15
i
believe.
