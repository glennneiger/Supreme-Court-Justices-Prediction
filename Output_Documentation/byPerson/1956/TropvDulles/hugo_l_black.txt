do
you
think
there's
any
problem
in
connection
with

assuming
that
the
government
can
deprive
people
of
citizenship,
as
citizen,
do
you
think
there's
any
problem
in
connection
whether
that
should
be
done
--
justice
hugo

--
by
a
civil
trial
or
military
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
assuming
that's
true,
that
punishment
that
will
be
inflicted
will
be
the
loss
of
citizenship.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
trust
that
to
the
army,
rather
than
to
the
public
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
upon
of
the
same
aspects
allowed
here,
the
court
martial
for
the
crime
of
traitors
with
the
army
or
businessmen?
justice
hugo

did
you
say
a
supplemental
brief?
justice

what
are
you
reading
from
the
proviso

justice

justice

black
has
the
distinction
between
awol
and
desertion
(inaudible)
justice

one
--
one
day
he's
gotten
out
of
jail
and
today
he's
coming
back
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
presumably
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
about
the
time
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
i'm
just
--
maybe
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
that.
i've
read
the
undisputed
facts
that's
in
the
record
which
is
there,
it
simply
means
that
he
just
got
out
there
in
order
to
see
if
he
came
back
to
his
own
unit
so
he'll
be
treated
fairly
and
one
doesn't
take
but
a
few
hours
and
then
came
back
and
they
confined
him
in
for
desertion.
i
thought
desertion
was
a
crime
and
abandonment
that
deserves
the
detention
that
depended
on
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
awol
was
just
a
term
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
our
problem.but
it's
a
little
strange
to
me
that
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
it
was
so
treated
here
by
this
court-matial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
that
we
have
to
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
there's
more
with
perez
(inaudible)
different
requirements.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
should
not
be
bound
for
this
â€“
the
court
must
be
bound
by
the
jury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
you
said
it
could
be.
the
judge
could
if
he
wanted
to
get
one.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
does
the
record
show
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
we
can
permit
the
desertion,
quite
an
extraordinary
thing
even
to
give
them
a
discretionary
right
to
take
a
man
back.
and
i'm
very
surprised
to
lead
you
to
say
that
they
took
him
back
by
the
thousands
that
it
was
in
agreement
with
desertion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
point
us
to
the
--
any
record
that
shows
they
took
them
back
by
the
thousands
and
they
made
the
disposition
of
desertion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it's
--
just
strikes
me
as
rather
unusual.
i
--
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
never
thought
of
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
how
was
it
--
how
did
it
operate?
it's
very
careful
to
say
they
may
be
permitted
by
competent
military
authority
to
come.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
you
did
not
state
it's
irrelevant
to
the
--
to
the
legal
issue
of
the
(inaudible)
because
i
was
just
curious
of
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
think
we
can
do
that
part
of
the
decision.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
it
might
be
also
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it
might
be
also
thought
that
when
he's
already
been
in
jail
once
and
got
away
again,
there's
(inaudible)
once
and
got
away
again,
the
--
the
usual
feeling
of
the
army
for
a
man
of
that
kind
particularly
at
war
time
was
up
at
the
top
and
he's
probably
nowhere
and
--
and
he
couldn't
get
in,
wouldn't
that
be
just
as
reasonable
[laughs]
as
the
evidence
of
this?
i
don't
think
it's
really
so.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
fraenkel,
is
your
position
there
get
down
to
this?
i'm
not
sure
of
that.
that
for
a
crime,
a
man
could
be
deprived
of
the
right
to
vote,
could
be
deprived
of
a
number
of
other
rights
with
the
connections
of
--
by
living
in
this
country
as
a
citizen
does.but
that
he
cannot
be
made
in
the
state
live.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
it's
the
constitution
makes
him
a
citizen
of
the
country?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
therefore,
protects
him
from
being
banished
as
a
punishment
for
a
crime
or
for
anything
else.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
your
position?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
the
law
provide
with
reference
to
a
noncitizen
to
the
right
to
stay
in
this
country
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
the
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
deportation
relates
to
alienation.
