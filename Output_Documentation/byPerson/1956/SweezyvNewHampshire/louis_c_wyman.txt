mr.
louis
c.
wyman
may
it
please
the
court.
i
feel
that
this
case
here
is
a
very
simple
case,
essentially.
we
have
a
--
a
situation
which
requires
a
good
deal
of
clarification
as
to
the
facts,
i
think,
before
it's
possible
to
realize
just
exactly
what
the
issues
are.
i
think
that
it's
important
to
remember
here
that
first
of,
the
position
of
mr.
sweezy
before
the
committee
and
i
would
like
to
refer
to
the
attorney
general
for
the
purpose
of
the
investigation
as
a
committee
rather
than
as
the
attorney
general,
so
as
to
avoid
possibility
of
misunderstanding
as
to
the
various
aspects
of
separation
of
powers
in
view
of
the
decision
of
the
new
hamsphire
supreme
court
referring
constantly
to
the
function
of
the
committee
as
a
fact
finding
committee
in
the
person,
the
attorney
general.
he
was
a
witness
before
the
committee.
he
was
not
a
defendant.
the
testimony
which
was
taken
in
this
case
was
taken
in
private
sessions.
it
was
not
taken
in
public.
the
position
of
mr.
sweezy
never
became
that
of
a
defendant,
until
after
in
private
session
represented
by
counsel.
he
had
declined
to
answer
questions
not
claiming
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
and
none
under
the
practice
which
we
have
in
new
hampshire.
it
was
necessary
for
the
administrative
official
given
the
power
to
subpoena
to
transfer
the
matter
to
the
superior
court
and
to
ask
the
superior
court
to
go
on
with
matter
just
as
though
it
had
been
commenced
initially
in
the
superior
court.
that's
the
law
in
new
hampshire.
there's
no
such
thing
as
a
direct
contempt
of
an
administrative
official
without
the
insulation
of
a
court
hearing.
and
in
this
case,
after
the
private
sessions
and
with
no
publicity
whatever,
there
was
filed
with
the
superior
court
a
petition,
asking
for
the
court's
help.
and
in
the
process
of
trying
to
find
out
whether
or
not
these
questions
were
relevant,
the
superior
court
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire
spent
two
and
a
half
days
of
argument
in
which
two
counsel,
very
confident
counsel
in
our
state
were
involved,
before
the
court
determined
and
ruled
that
the
questions
were
relevant.
and
then,
the
court
went
ahead
and
directed
mr.
sweezy
to
answer
the
questions.
and
mr.
sweezy
then
continued
to
refuse
to
answer
in
court,
and
the
court's
finding
then
was
that
he
was
in
contempt
and
he
was
released
on
bail
and
the
case
went
up
to
the
supreme
court
of
new
hamsphire
and
is
reported
at
page
210
of
the
transcript
in
this
case
in
full.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
there
was
no
statement
made
by
me
to
the
press,
your
honor.
mr.
sweezy
himself
made
public
that
he
had
appeared
and
talked
to
the
press
right
outside
the
hall
in
my
office
when
he
came
in.
now,
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i
would
like
to
answer
that
directly
by
saying
that
in
new
hamsphire,
this
whole
business
of
investigating
to
see
if
there
were
any
subversive
activities
in
the
state
was
passed
by
our
legislature
in
1953.
it
was
at
a
time
when
there
was
a
good
deal
of
confusion
about
this
whole
subject
and
there
had
been
some
abuses.
and
before
we
went
ahead,
we
drafted
in
new
hamsphire
the
rules
of
procedure
which
are
set
forth
in
our
brief
in
this
case
at
page
51.
those
rules
of
procedure
were
adopted
with
the
view
to
getting
away
from
just
such
sort
of
difficulties
that
had
happened
in
the
past.
and
they
specifically
provide
that
all
testimony
will
be
taken
and
i
refer
at
page
52,
the
rule
one.
"insofar
as
possible
examination
of
witnesses,"
and
i'm
quoting,
“will
be
conducted
in
executive
session.
hearings
will
not
be
held
in
public
unless
requested
by
the
witness."
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
yes,
sir,
and
the
reason
i
referred
to
it
is
that
a
very
excellent
law
review
article
quoted
by
appellant
in
his
brief
in
65
yale
l.j.
makes
a
good
deal
of
the
point
that
the
only
application
of
the
first
amendment
to
this
type
of
situation
that's
meritorious
can
apply
if
a
person
is
hauled
into
a
public
session
and
the
matter
is
--
gone
into
--
to
the
extent
of
reaching
an
abuse
of
his
privacy
and
his
rights
of
privacy.
and
i
merely
wanted
to
point
out
that
in
the
rules
of
procedure
which
is
applied
in
new
hampshire
and
which
specifically
applied
to
this
case,
there
has
been
no
such
pushing
of
witnesses
around.
i
hope
that
before
a
decision
is
ultimately
made
in
this
case
that
both
of
the
transcripts
on
the
questioning
of
this
witness
which
appear
in
full
in
the
transcript
and
before
the
court
will
be
read
to
get
the
general
sense
of
the
situation
that
existed.
this
would
be
the
relationship
between
the
witness
and
the
persons
asking
the
questions.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i
believe,
your
honor,
it's
unimportant.
there
are
others
who
have
said
in
law
review
journals
that
there
is
some
appointments
to
be
attached
to
it
and
i
think
what
they're
really
talking
about
is
a
matter
of
method
as
distinct
from
a
general
rule,
a
matter
of
method
as
to
whether
you
proceed
in
public
hearing
for
reasons
somewhat
unconcerned
with,
perhaps
just
investigating
and
perhaps
connected
with
political
activity.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
no.
they
wouldn't,
except
that
in
this
case
before
the
witness
was
found
to
be
in
contempt,
a
court
had
to
pass
on
the
question
of
relevancy.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
no,
your
honor,
it
couldn't
and
that
of
course,
objection
was
made
in
this
case,
before
the
court.
it
was
argued
before
the
supreme
court
in
new
hampshire
and
disposed
of
contrary
to
the
position
of
appellant
before
that
court
on
the
first
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
that's
--
that's
right,
your
honor
and
that's
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
that's
correct
and
that's
why
before
going
further
here,
i
would
like
again
to
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
rules
of
procedure
which
applied
in
new
hampshire,
which
require
that
a
copy
of
the
rules
of
procedure
should
be
furnished
to
each
witness
before
he
comes
in
to
testify,
that
he
has
a
right
to
counsel,
that
he
has
a
right
to
participation
of
counsel.
that
in
the
event
of
a
public
hearing,
no
one
is
to
mention
any
names
in
a
defamatory
way
or
in
a
way
which
might
reflect
adversely
on
other
people
without
first
discussing
them
in
private
session.
that
any
witness
is
entitled
to
have
a
transcript
of
his
testimony
and
that
on
television
and
radio,
there
will
be
no
television
and
no
radio
unless
the
witness
requested
it.
that
is
one
of
the
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
this,
your
honor,
is
at
page
52
of
our
brief,
51
and
52,
the
rules
of
procedure
which
have
applied
throughout
in
new
hampshire
and
applied
specifically
to
this
case.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
no,
we
haven't,
your
honor,
not
yet.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
none,
whatever.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
this
hearing
was
in
my
office
in
one
room
and
no
one
was
present
except
the
witness
and
his
counsel
and
myself
and
on
one
occasion,
two
assistant
attorney's
general.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
perhaps
so,
your
honor.
as
we
see
it
in
this
case,
there
are
just
two
issues,
one
whether
your
decision
in
commonwealth
versus
steve
nelson
supersedes
the
right
of
a
state
to
investigate
or
perhaps
in
a
corollary
sense,
the
right
of
a
state
to
make
it
a
crime
to
overthrow
a
state
government
as
distinct
from
overthrow
of
the
federal
government.
and
second,
whether
free
speech
generally
speaking
is
abridged
in
the
first
amendment
sense
by
a
legislative
inquiry
which
is
always
subject
to
rules
of
pertinence.
mr.
emerson,
professor
emerson
has
made
a
lot
here
of
so-called
sanctions
all
through
his
brief.
it
is
implicit
that
the
sanctions
of
the
legislative
process
of
investigation
are
something
which
are
a
burden
which
a
citizen
does
not
and
should
not
have
to
bear,
because
of
the
first
amendment,
even
though
the
questions
which
are
asked
of
the
witness
are
relevant
and
pertinent
to
a
fact
finding
investigation
in
aid
of
legislation.
i
am
unable
personally
to
quite
see
what
those
sanctions
are
or
what
they
can
be,
particularly
when
one
realizes
that
any
abuse
of
method
or
any
abuse
of
a
witness
is
always
subject
to
--
to
judicial
review.
and
all
such
cases
can
readily
be
set
aside
in
the
event
that
legitimate
private
rights
have
been
abused
in
the
way
which
the
court
abuses
and
violated
of
due
process
of
law.
if
the
method
is
fair,
if
the
questioning
is
courteous
without
any
clink
lights,
if
it's
relevant
and
so
found
by
a
court,
then
i
think
there
is
no
room
if
you're
going
to
have
intelligent
legislation.
there's
no
room
to
apply
the
first
amendment
to
prevent
that
type
of
question.
in
rumely
versus
u.s.
where
they
had
a
lobbying
investigation.
and
in
de
jong
versus
oregon,
with
questions
of
membership
in
a
party
meeting
as
distinct
from
membership
in
a
party.
all
in
many
of
these
cases
where
you
have
investigations
not
into
subversive
activities,
it
is
well
settled
that
the
play
of
freedom
of
speech
is
much
broader
than
it
is
in
the
field
of
subversion.
in
dennis
versus
u.s.,
the
decision
of
this
court
in
an
exhaustive
sense
brought
so
much
to
bear
upon
the
application
of
the
first
amendment
to
this
case.
and
since
that
decision,
there
have
been
numerous
decisions
in
the
circuit
courts
and
in
the
district
courts,
which
has
specifically
ruled
on
the
question
which
is
involved
here
now
and
which
have
found
certiorari
denied.
i
refer
particularly
for
example
to
u.s.
versus
josephson
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
to
which
certiorari
was
denied
in
which
the
majority
very
explicitly
dealt
with
the
application
of
the
first
amendment
to
questioning
otherwise
relevant
in
investigation
by
the
house
committee
on
un-american
activities.
as
far
as
one
thing
and
i've
read
a
good
many
of
the
very
cogent
reasons
which
have
been
advanced
by
some
members
of
this
court
in
these
cases
which
deal
with
civil
liberties,
civil
rights,
private
rights.one
thing
that
i
think
is
important
to
remember
here
is
that
this
isn't
a
question
of
asking
a
man
how
he
voted.
this
isn't
the
question
of
calling
somebody
a
first
amendment
communist
or
calling
somebody
a
fifth
amendment
communist,
or
doing
anything
which
is
entirely
inept
and
has
resulted
in
a
good
deal
of
unfortunate
confusion
relating
to
this
whole
subject.
this
is
a
case
where
it's
important
to
remember
the
reasons
on
the
record
for
questioning
this
witness.
and
this
witness
gave
ample
reasons
had
you
been
in
the
same
position
for
questioning
him
concerning
what
in
fact
he
said
at
this
lecture
at
the
university
of
new
hamsphire.
referring
to
the
record
itself,
the
witness
at
page
82
testified
that
he
considered
himself
a
marxist.
now,
when
i
say
page
82,
your
honors,
i'm
referring
to
the
transcripts
of
testimony
which
were
before
the
court
at
the
time
that
the
court
was
asked
to
continue
with
the
questioning.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
the
lecture
was
not
available
to
me
except
that
there
was
another
witness
which
was
called
--
who
was
called
in
the
joint
hearing
before
the
court,
named
professor
gwynne
daggett
at
the
university
of
new
hamsphire
and
eventually,
he
was
directed
to
answer
by
the
court
and
he
did
answer
and
we
did
go
on
in
private
session
at
some
length.
but
in
his
answers
as
the
transcript
will
show
and
as
this
transcript
shows
as
applied
to
sweezy,
the
answers
were
less
than
candid
to
put
it
mildly.
mr.
sweezy,
after
this
investigation
was
over,
furnished
the
transcript
of
what
he
purported
he
said
in
his
lecture
but
declined
to
do
it
to
the
court
in
compliance
with
its
order.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
just
furnished
--
didn't
furnish
it
to
me,
your
honor.
he
furnished
it
generally,
publicly,
issued
it
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
issued
it
publicly.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
that's
correct.
and
the
--
the
matter
became
one
of
what
i
considered
at
the
time
was
aggravated
contempt,
but
i
file
no
further
petitions
with
the
court
because
the
matter
was
before
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire.
when
you
come
further
into
the
record,
you
find
that
there
were
two
transcripts
that
were
taken
in
questioning
this
witness,
one
was
in
january
1954.
and
in
between
the
january
questioning
and
the
june
questioning,
the
witness
gave
a
lecture
at
the
university
of
new
hampshire.
i
learned
about
the
lecture
and
because
of
the
matters
which
appear
in
the
transcript
in
which
i'm
now
going
to
refer
to,
the
witness
was
recalled
in
private
session
and
questioned
further
about
just
what
he
said
in
the
lecture.
at
page
74
and
75
of
the
record,
the
witness
was
inquired
or
was
asked
concerning
a
translation
of
principles
of
communism
by
frederick
engels
which
he
had
prepared.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
asked
whether
or
not
this
case
involved
a
reading
on
something
to
a
witness
and
then
asking
the
witness,
“did
you
say
this
in
your
lecture?”
and
the
answer
to
that
question,
your
honor,
is
yes
that's
exactly
what
this
case
involves.
and
while
i'm
on
that
point,
sir,
i'd
like
to
say
further
that
the
trial
court
in
this
case
directed
the
witness
to
answer
the
question
of
whether
he
believed
in
communism
on
the
authority
of
lawson
versus
u.s.
and
the
supreme
court,
on
that
particular
issue,
ordered
the
witness
to
answer
just
that
question.
that
appears
in
the
record
at
page
193
and
194
where
the
issues
are
dealt
with
by
the
court
and
the
witness
is
directed
to
answer
just
those
questions.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
at
page
205,
your
honor.
and
in
order
to
avoid
getting
into
the
questions
of
just
what
questions
were
asked,
the
actual
transcript
of
the
actual
proceedings
before
the
court
begins
at
page
201.
and
the
questions
which
were
asked
and
refused
and
the
reasons
assigned
in
the
court
appear
at
pages
201
to
209.and
the
question
on
belief
in
communism
at
page
205
and
i'm
reading
a
question,
line
--
about
line
10.
“and
now,
do
you
believe
in
communism?”
answer,
“if
the
definition
and
characterization
of
communism
are
those
presented
in
the
preamble
of
the
1951
act,
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
beyond
that
however,
i
decline
to
answer
the
question
on
the
advice
of
counsel
and
for
reasons
given
by
counsel."
and
at
page
208,
your
honor,
in
line
3.
the
court,
“all
right,
you
are
ordered
to
answer
the
questions
which
you
have
declined
to
answer.”
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i
did
not
mess
the
questions,
your
honor.
i
referred
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i
referred
to
the
transcript
in
the
court
proceedings
which
appears
in
the
record
as
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
that's
right,
your
honor,
and
those
are
the
questions.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
no,
your
honor,
because
in
the
petition
which
i
filed
with
the
superior
court
under
our
practice
which
was
just
referred
to,
i
had
to
set
forth
the
questions
which
we
wanted
the
court
to
answer
and
--
to
order
answered,
and
the
answers
which
the
witness
had
given.
and
that
is
exactly
what
happened
and
it's
important,
i
believe
in
the
original
transcript
which
this
court
has
to
know
that
paragraph
3
of
the
prayer
of
the
original
petition
was
that,
and
i
quote,
“in
the
event,
the
respondent
elects
to
proceed
to
answer
the
questions
put
that
this
honorable
court
direct
respondent
to
appear
before
petitioner
in
private
session
and
resume
further
questioning,”
but
the
only
questions
appear
at
record
201.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
all
questions,
yes,
your
honor.
all
questions
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
the
decision
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i
think
i
can,
your
honor.
all
questions
relating
to
opinion
and
belief
were
disallowed
by
how
a
supreme
court
except
the
single
question,
“do
you
believe
in
communism?”
that
appears
in
the
decision
of
the
trial
court
in
the
order
of
the
trial
court
in
this
case
which
was
in
this
sense
affirmed
by
the
supreme
court
in
its
opinion.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i
believe
that
is
correct,
but
that
is
the
only
one,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i
will
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
yes,
sir,
of
course.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
no,
i
do
not.
i
think
that
the
list
appearing
in
the
transcript
at
page
201
is
the
only
list
that
can
possibly
be
referred
to
here,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
well,
i
understand
that,
your
honor,
except
that
in
this
matter
of,
”do
you
believe
in
communism,”
which
is
the
only
question
of
belief
involved
and
which
was
cited
on
authority
of
the
lawson.
i
do
not
see
that
at
pages
11
and
12
of
his
brief,
he
has
considered
it.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i
believe
it's
the
only
one.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i
think
his
list
is
accurate,
your
honor,
but
i
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
yes,
i
think
his
list
is
accurate
so
far
as
i
can
observe
apart
from
that
one,
except
that
if
the
list
in
his
brief
is
looked
at
in
the
form
that
the
questions
there
appear
without
looking
at
the
exchanges
between
the
court
and
the
questioner
which
appeared
in
court
and
which
appear
in
the
record
at
page
201,
you
get
a
decidedly
different
flavor
to
the
whole
proceeding.
and
for
that
reason,
i
felt
that
the
best
review
of
what
actually
happened
was
the
actual
transcript
of
what
actually
happened.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
some
of
the
questions
were
disallowed
by
the
court.some
of
the
questions
were
withdrawn
by
the
questioner
and
rephrased
in
different
form
in
order
to
meet
the
convenience
of
the
witness
and
in
order
to
avoid
confusion.
the
questions
as
they
appear
in
appellant's
brief
in
naked
form
look
a
little
bit
like
bulldozing,
your
honor.
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
transcript,
you'll
see
that
there
was
none
of
that
in
this
case.
in
the
record
back
at
74
and
75
on
this
translation
of
principles
of
communism
by
frederick
engels
by
mr.
sweezy
who
has
written
several
books
on
the
subject
in
socialism
and
other
subject,
mr.
sweezy
is
asked
the
question
and
i'm
quoting.
i
will
not
quote
very
long.
reading
from
his
translation
referring
to
engels
having
a
master's
touch
in
focusing
the
readers'
attention
and
quote,
“in
getting
across
the
central
message
of
a
new
society
in
the
making,”
sweezy
says
and
i
quote.
“and
this
was
asked
in
the
form
of
a
question
this
is
no
scholarly
track
that
selects,
emphasizes
and
exaggerates.
as
such,
it
is
that
expression
relevant
today
as
it
was
more
than
100
years
ago.
the
revolutions
of
1848
proved
supportive
and
the
greatest
period
of
capitalist
expansion
was
still
in
the
future."
much
that
engels
wrote
at
that
time
was
inevitably
premature,
but
this
only
means
that
it
is
all
the
more
relevant
for
us
at
a
time
when
the
tide
of
world
revolution
has
already
swirled
over
a
large
part
of
the
earth
and
is
daily
rising
higher
despite
the
frantic
demands
of
our
20th
century
canoes.”
then
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i
agree,
your
honor,
and
that's
exactly
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
well,
i
haven't
quite
finished,
if
i
could
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
--
in
respect
of
what
was
asking.
and
then,
going
on
in
the
literal
rephrasing
of
the
question,
quote.
“if
the
oppressed
proletariat
is
finally
driven
to
the
revolution,
then
we
communist,”
this
is
a
quotation
from
the
extract,
“will
defend
interest
of
the
proletarians
with
this
as
we
now
defend
them
with
words.”
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i'm
reading
from
75,
your
honor,
the
record
at
75
above
line
18
at
the
bottom
of
the
quotation.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
in
the
middle
of
theppage
75.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
no,
that's
not
his
answer.
that
was
a
part
of
his
translation.
and
then
he
was
asked
this
question
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
by
that
question
and
by
that
answer
in
your
translation.
“did
you
mean
to
imply
directly
or
indirectly
that
if
the
oppressed
proletariat
is
finely
driven
to
revolution,
thereby,
that
the
interest
of
the
proletariat
would
be
defended
with
deeds
as
now
with
words?”
the
witness,
“by
that,
i
meant
--
i
simply
meant
to
present
the
ideas
engels
foot
forward.
you
can
interpret
it
as
you
like
it.”
now,
going
on
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
none
whatever
objection
in
the
sensorial
sense,
your
honor,
none
whatever.
there
was
then
asked
whether
or
not
these
translations
and
these
views
were
advocated
to
the
students,
but
i,
if
i
could,
would
like
to
touch
some
other
things
that
came
in
between
the
january
1954
hearing
and
the
june
1954.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
that's
right,
your
honor,
exactly.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
that's
right.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
well,
if
i
could
be
--
if
i
can
sum
this
all
up
in
just
a
little
--
a
little
phrase.
at
42
of
the
record,
at
42
of
the
record,
you'll
see
that
mr.
sweezy
is
asked
the
question
in
the
middle
of
the
page.
“isn't
it
true,
mr.
sweezy,
that
the
socialism
you
have
been
advocating
exist
only
in
communist
countries
today?"
answer,
mr.
sweezy,
“yes,
that
is
true.
written,
hasn't
actually
succeeded
yet
in
establishing
a
socialist
system.”
now,
that
then
tied
into
a
question
which
later
appears
in
the
transcript,
at
least
we
thought
it
did.
“did
you
tell
the
class
that
socialism
in
america
was
inevitable?"
and
the
answer
to
that
eventually
through
a
series
of
hearings
was,
“yes.”
but
then,
when
the
question
proceeded
further
into
exactly
what
else
was
said
and
what
was
advocated,
the
witness
declined
to
discuss
even
the
subject
of
his
lecture
or
what
he
took
into
the
lecture
room
or
anything
else
that
happened
there,
and
we
still
don't
know
what
went
on
in
that
lecture,
not
in
an
effort
for
one
minute
to
tell
this
witness
that
he
couldn't
say
anything
that
was
lawful,
but
only
for
the
purpose
of
seeking
to
find
out
whether
or
not
in
conformity
with
the
legislative
mandate,
there
had
actually
been
advocacy
of
subversion
as
that
phrase
is
used
in
the
basic
act.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
no,
i
do
not,
your
honor.
i
do
not
at
all.
i
do
think,
however,
that
when
one
considers
the
testimony
that
the
witness
considers
himself
a
marxist
and
that
the
socialism
which
he
has
in
mind
and
i'm
not
in
authority
on
this,
is
a
socialism
which
can
only
exist
in
communist
countries.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
does,
that's
--
that's
correct.
and
then
when
one
looks
at
the
writing
which
appears
at
page
82
and
83
of
this
witness
which
was
written
in
the
monthly
review
and
in
which
--
well,
i
do
not
wish
to
read
the
whole
thing.
i
feel
that
i
must
take
the
time
to
at
least
read
a
summary
for
the
reason
that
i
consider
and
we
consider
this
alone
beyond
anything
else
to
warrant
the
questioning
of
the
witness
as
to
the
lecture.
i'm
not
and
i
don't
have
the
time
here
to
go
into
all
the
other
excerpts
that
appear
in
the
transcript
of
organizations
that
appeared
on
any
attorney
general's
list.
to
that
matter,
i
might
consider
--
might
be
considered
relevancy
for
asking
somebody
about
associations
with
persons
on
the
list
or
not
depending
upon
the
point
of
view
of
a
committee.
but
here
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
100.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
approximately
100,
your
honor
and
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i
did
not
summon
students
to
be
informers
on
their
teacher,
your
honor.
that
was
my
decision.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i
didn't
try
to
do
that.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i
can
only
say
because
i
felt
that
that
was
something
that
i
wanted
to
avoid
at
least
as
far
as
my
decision
was
concerned.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i
thought
that
there
was
a
ground
for
questioning
him
in
as
much
as
the
excerpt
which
appears
at
page
82,
was
finished
to
me
by
the
witness
himself.
and
in
as
much
as
i
had
a
letter
from
a
professor
at
the
university
of
new
hampshire
which
appears
in
the
record
and
about
which
the
witness
was
questioned
to
the
effect
that
his
lecture
consisted
of
a
thinly-glass
older
version
of
the
dialectic
material.of
--
another
words,
of
the
third
facet
of
that
elements
--
of
those
elements
in
marxism,
surplus
value
,class
struggle
and
dialectical
materialism
which
appeared
to
involve
at
least
a
part
of
the
penance
here
of
communism.
whether
they
involve
or
include
in
a
particular
individual
case
advocacy
of
overthrow
to
the
government
by
force
and
violence,
we
don't
know.
that's
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
that
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
that
is
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
he
disavowed
it
in
this
way,
your
honor.
he
said
in
his
lecture,
“i
didn't
advocate
force
and
violence."
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
"i
am
not
a
communist.”
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
that
is
correct.
he
disavowed
that
and
then
he
said
that,
“i
don't
--
i
am
not
a
communist.
i've
never
been
a
communist.
beyond
this,
i'm
not
talking.
i
am
not
answering
your
questions.”
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
that's
correct.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
that
is
correct.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
and
that's
what
we
thought
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
well,
he
may,
your
honor.
and
at
this
point,
i
feel
that
all
i
can
do
is
read
this
which
appears
in
the
transcript
at
page
82.
and
i'm
quoting
now
for
something
which
mr.
sweezy
wrote
with
leo
huberman
in
the
monthly
review.
and
in
the
transcript
at
page
108,
reaffirmed
today,
namely
on
june
4th,
1954.
it
expresses
my
opinions,
yes.
quote,
“in
which
country
within
the
last
few
months
did
the
presidential
candidate
promise
peace,
and
immediately
upon
taking
office,
said
about
spreading
war?”
and
as
regards
to
leaders
of
the
two
camps
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
in
the
center
of
the
page,
your
honor,
record
82.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
“and
as
regards
to
leaders
of
the
two
camps
that
are
certain
that
in
the
last
eight
years,
the
united
states
has
been
responsible
for
killing
a
vastly
greater
number
of
human
beings
than
has
the
soviet
union.
we
would
not
argue
however
that
the
quantitative
question
even
if
it
were
possible
to
answer
it
with
precision
is
the
crucial
one.
in
the
last
analysis,
those
who
hate
violence
must
judge
it
by
an
entirely
different
standard.
they
must
ask
whether
violence
is
used
to
perpetuate
the
state
of
affairs
in
which
violence
is
inevitable
or
whether
it
is
used
in
the
interest
of
creating
a
truly
human
society
from
which
it
will
be
possible
at
long
last
to
banish
violence
altogether.
so
far
as
the
united
states
and
its
allies
are
concerned,
there
is
unfortunately
no
doubt
about
the
answer.
our
country
is
preparing
to
practice
violence
on
a
hitherto
undreamed-of
scale
to
preserve
a
social
order
which
in
the
space
of
four
decades
has
already
produced
the
greatest
orgy
of
violence
in
the
whole
long
and
violent
history
of
the
human
race.
capitalism,
the
organization
of
society
according
to
the
barbaric
principle
of
private
profit,
is
the
scourge
of
mankind.and
violence
designed
to
preserve
it
is
doubly
damned,
once
for
itself
and
once
for
its
purpose.
those
of
us
who
have
socialism
in
our
bones,
will
believe
that
a
truly
human
society
can
be
erected
only
on
the
basis
of
common
ownership
and
economic
planning,
must
necessarily
judge
the
violence
of
the
socialist
countries
differently.
we
hate
it
as
we
hate
all
violence.
we
would
have
vastly
preferred
to
have
the
building
of
the
new
economy
take
place
peacefully
and
painlessly
as
it
could
have
at
the
advance
countries
that
led
the
way.
but
history
which
as
frederick
engels
once
said
is
a
most
cruel
goddess,
decreed
that
the
economic
foundations
of
the
society
of
the
future
must
be
laid
in
backward
countries,
not
only
without
the
assistance
of
the
advanced
countries
but
against
their
ruthless
and
implacable
resistance.
it
was
thereby
rendered
inevitable
that
the
process
should
be
difficult,
painful
and
violent.
but
the
process
does
go
forward.
of
that,
the
majestic
successes
of
the
soviet
economy
despite
all
the
strains
and
trials
to
which
it
has
been
subject
within
these
years
of
hot
and
cold
wars
is
irrefutable
proof.
and
the
hopes
of
mankind
for
a
better
future
go
with
it.
for
the
first
time
in
history,
we
can
say
that
violence
is
being
used
to
protect
regimes
which
are
doing
their
utmost
to
create
a
society
which
will
be
able
to
dispense
with
violence.
that
makes
all
the
difference.
”well,
when
that
--
when
we
had
that
in
an
investigation
which
in
the
last
analysis
is
justifiable
in
relation
to
this
aspect
of
first
amendment
and
freedom
of
speech
issues,
only
because
of
this,
the
necessity
of
a
state
or
the
federal
government
to
look
into
the
question
of
whether
there
are
people
around
seeking
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
i
felt
that
it
was
necessary
to
question
the
witness
concerning
what
terms
he
used
and
what
he
actually
said.
it
is
our
state
university.
we
do
support
it
with
tax
money.
we
do
feel
that
if
we
want
to
find
burglar
for
example
which
you
approved
in
this
court
in
adler
versus
board
of
education,
we
might
wish
to
make
recommendations
concerning
legislation
of
that
type
in
new
hampshire.
i
don't
say
that
it's
necessary
at
all.
i
don't
know.
one
can't
know
until
at
least
the
witness
is
directed
to
answer
relevant
questions.
as
far
as
the
witness
was
concerned,
he
simply
declined
to
answer.
he
didn't
claim
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
and
now,
the
position
here
apparently
is
that
even
if
questions
are
relevant
and
on
that
point,
the
decision
of
the
highest
court
in
new
hampshire
is
that
they
were
irrelevant.
even
if
they
are
relevant
that
there
is
some
sort
of
a
road
block
of
the
first
amendment
which
ought
to
be
inserted
to
bar
questioning.
as
a
practical
matter,
it's
a
little
difficult
to
know
just
where
one
would
draw
the
line,
if
there
is
to
be
a
road
block
of
that
type.
but
assuming
that
a
line
could
be
drawn,
then
the
question
becomes
hardly
abuses,
hardly
invasions
of
freedom
of
speech
in
its
absolute
sense,
as
such
a
menace
to
the
security
and
welfare
of
america
that
the
first
amendment
ought
to
be
used
in
this
type
of
situation.
we
--
we
submit
that
they
are
not.
we
submit
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
apply
here.
we
submit
that
the
test
must
be
its
state
legislatures
or
the
congress
of
the
united
states
as
to
be
intelligently
informed.
the
test
must
be,
one,
that
there
must
be
a
--
a
law
which
is
constitutional,
a
resolution
which
is
tied
to
it
which
is
clear
and
which
reasonably
informs
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
said,
"the
charter
of
the
investigating
committee,
what
its
powers
are."
we
then
maintain
that
the
questions
asked
under
that
charter
must
be
relevant
to
the
subject
matter.
as
is
said
in
u.s.
versus
ullmann,
what
that
means
is
directed
to
a
--
in
a
possible
answer,
a
possible
answer
which
would
have
to
do
with
the
main
object
of
the
investigation.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
oh,
no.
it
isn't
anywhere
as
near
as
broad
as
that
in
the
sense
that
they
are
not
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i
read
it,
your
honor,
to
try
to
show
that
a
writing
such
as
that
from
a
person
in
these
times,
reaffirmed
by
that
person,
together
with
membership
or
association
or
affiliation
with
organizations
that
were
supposed
to
be
in
the
opinion
of
some
people
were
controlled
by
a
communist,
together
with
a
number
of
other
aspects
which
have
been
referred
to,
affords
grounds
for
questioning,
the
witness
in
regard
to
what
he
said
to
students
and
they
require
the
course
at
a
state
university.
not
in
an
effort
to
central
what
he
said
at
all
but
in
an
effort
to
inform
the
legislature
as
to
whether
there
was
advocacy
of
subversive
conduct
as
defined
in
the
statute.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
your
honor,
i
haven't
criticized
the
witness.
i
haven't
called
the
witness
a
communist.
i
don't
know
what
the
witness
really
is.
i
--
i'm
not
and
offered
them
expert
in
the
field
to
know.
all
i
know
is
that
we
ran
up
against
the
point
of
which
the
witness
declined
to
answer
and
the
issue
which
is
basically
involved
here
is
whether
or
not
the
classrooms
of
america,
if
the
matter
is
to
become
broad
enough,
are
to
be
impervious
from
fact
finding
investigation,
construct
--
conducted
in
a
restraint
and
reasonable
manner
in
private
session
under
rules
of
relevancy.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
that's
right,
your
honor
and
that,
i
referred
to
and
meant
to
refer
to
in
relation
to
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
asked
mr.
emerson
because
just
that
sort
of
thing
did
happen
here.
he
was
questioned
concerning
documents
which
were
involved
and
the,
“i
don't
think
so”
or
“i
refuse
to
answer”
or
“i
don't
remember,”
appears
in
the
first
transcript.
“i
don't,”
how
many
times
but
more
than
24
times
in
the
second
transcript.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
don't
know.
i
don't
want
to
make
a
suggestion
or
be
construed
as
making
a
suggestion
that
any
witness
has
committed
perjury.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
that
is
right
,
your
honor,
but
when
it
came
to
asking
him
what
he
said,
what
he
advocated
or
what
he
said
if
you
will
in
the
lecture,
he
wouldn't
answer.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
well,
only
that
that's
what
he
said,
your
honor.
as
i
say,
what
we
were
--
what
we
were
trying
to
find
out
was
whether
or
not
there
was
teaching
here
or
advocacy.
i'd
like
to
point
out
if
i
may
that
the
first
recommendation
in
the
report
which
mr.
emerson
has
referred
to
here
to
the
general
court
of
new
hampshire
which
was
made
as
a
result
of
these
investigations,
and
these
two
transcripts
were
a
part
of
this
were,
and
i'm
quoting.
“without
attempting
to
set
out
exact
language
of
a
resolution,
it
is
respectfully
recommended
that
there'll
be
enacted
in
new
hampshire,
some
expression
of
legislative
approval
of
forces
designed
to
objectively
teach
youth
throughout
new
hampshire
the
true
nature
and
meaning,
method
and
purpose
of
communism
in
relation
to
american
constitutional
government.
it
is
believed
to
be
of
genuine
importance
that
our
youths
should
be
taught
these
facts
so
that
they
may
be
able
to
understand
the
truth
and
help
to
protect
our
system
against
communist
cancer
of
the
mind,"
and
there
is
more
on
that.
there
has
never
been
any
attempt
to
suppress
and
there
is
none
implicit
in
proceedings
such
as
this,
freedom
of
thought
or
freedom
of
expression,
but
we
do
believe
that
we
are
entitled
to
investigate
to
determine
whether
there
has
been
advocacy
or
whether
it
has
just
been
teaching
in
the
object
of
sense.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor
and
i
think
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i
think
that's
right.
and
also,
of
course,
one
of
the
reasons
why
no
objection
was
made
to
the
question
of
jurisdiction
here
was,
that
we
would
like
to
find
out
if
we
could
just
exactly
how
far
the
steve
nelson
decision
goes
on
this
matter
of
legislation.
i
want
to
touch
--
i
only
have
a
few
minutes
left
upon
one
thing
here.
there
has
been
some
mention
of
the
fact
that
as
interpreted
by
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire,
the
definition
of
subversive
person
includes
a
person
who
is
a
member
of
an
organization
that
actually
is
subversive,
although
innocently
so,
not
knowing
it
could
be
such.
i'd
like
to
point
out
first
that
there
are
no
criminal
sanctions
attached
to
innocent
membership
and
that
the
principle
case's
decision
is
very
clear
to
point
that
out.
second,
that
no
element
of
loyalty
oath
is
involved
in
this
case.
in
wieman
versus
updegraff,
a
very
different
situation
apply
where
people
were
required
to
execute
affidavits
of
non-membership
in
subversive
organizations
or
organizations
on
the
attorney
general's
list,
even
though
there
was
no
requirement
that
they
were
knowingly
members
of
those
organizations
and
this
court
struck
that
down.
an
examination
of
the
record
in
that
case
indicates
that
they
offered
to
execute
an
affidavit
inserting
the
words
"not
knowingly
a
member,"
but
that
was
refused
by
the
local
officials.
in
this
case,
i
want
to
make
the
same
statement
to
this
court
if
there
should
be
any
part
of
confusion
on
that
issue,
in
this
particular
problem
here
that
--
that
the
attorney
general
of
maryland
made
to
this
court
in
gerende
verus
board
of
supervisors
in
which
you
approved
this
basic
type
of
legislation
in
that
respect
on
his
assurance
that
he
would
advice
appropriate
state
officials
that
they
should
accept
the
affidavits
which
insert
the
word
"knowingly"
before
any
such
comment.
that
certainly
would
apply
in
new
hampshire.
but
in
nelson
versus
wyman
in
99
n.h.
33
and
in
the
principle
case,
we
have
no
issue
here
of
any
loyalty
oath.
that's
not
involved.
the
only
real
issues
here
are
whether
the
steve
nelson
decision
eliminates
from
the
states
the
rights
to
make
it
a
crime
basically
to
overthrow
state
government
as
distinct
from
the
federal
government.
and
this
first
amendment
issue
of
whether
there
is
to
be
a
first
amendment
road
block
added
to
the
basic
other
formula
for
governing
fact
finding
investigations
that
they
allegedly
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
yes,
your
honor,
in
this
sense.
the
resolution
under
which
we
have
been
operating,
both
since
1953
and
as
renewed
by
the
general
court
in
new
hampshire
in
1955,
the
record
of
the
attorney
general
as
a
committee
for
the
legislature
to
investigate
whether
there
had
been
violations
of
the
subversive
activities
act
and
to
make
recommendations
for
legislation
if
any.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
that's
right.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
yes,
your
honor,
with
a
separability
clause
which
is
explicit.
on
that
subject,
i'd
like
to
say
and
to
invite
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
our
subversive
activities
law
in
new
hampshire
is
not
an
original
matter
with
us.
it
was
a
part
of
the
patent
of
subversive
activities
law
which
were
based
on
the
maryland
act.
and
in
shub
versus
simpson
which
was
the
circuit
court
case
prior
to
gerende
versus
board
of
supervisors,
this
whole
question
was
carefully
considered
and
the
appeal
was
dismissed
by
this
court
in
41
supreme
court.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
my
view
of
it
is
this.
i
think
what
you
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
want
to
be
presumptuous.
i
think
what
you
said
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i
think
what
you
said
was
that
state
sedition
acts
are
suspended
as
to
enforceability
for
so
long
as
the
smith
act
is
on
the
books,
that
both
paramount
interest
and
other
--
of
the
reasons
assigned
mean
that
the
states
should
not
go
into
this
field.
there
should
be
a
federal
field
in
a
sense
of
prosecution,
and
that
we
can't
prosecute.
i
don't
think
it
follows
from
that
that
our
legislation
is
completely
voided.
i
think
it
is
suspended
as
to
enforceability,
pending
the
period
of
the
smith
act
being
on
the
books.
that
has
been
our
position
and
i
would
like
to
say
that
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire,
two
days
--
three
days
ago
in
wyman
versus
uphaus,
number
4533,
considered
this
point
again
and
with
some
apparent
additional
authority
disclosed
to
the
--
in
the
same
manner
by
saying
that
this
was
investigation
and
not
prosecution.
and
an
investigation
on
no
theory
was
outlawed
by
the
--
by
the
basic
steve
nelson
decision.
on
that
point
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
it
--
it
can
--
it
covers
both
state
and
federal,
your
honor,
but
there
is
some
question
of
course.
we
have
taken
the
position
all
along
that
it's
impossible
to
seek
to
overthrow
the
federal
government
without
including
the
states.
and
as
far
as
investigation
is
concerned,
we
claim
under
the
tenth
amendment
that
if
anybody
is
around
really
trying
to
overthrow
the
government
of
the
united
states
of
america
that
each
state
does
have
an
interest
in
it.
and
at
least
as
far
as
fact
finding
investigation
is
concerned,
we'd
like
to
help.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i
think
new
hampshire
can
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i
think
new
hampshire
can
legislate
as
it
has
and
this
is
on
the
books
to
make
it
a
crime
to
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
state
government
by
force
and
violence.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
that's
right.
i
think
it
could
legislate
a
feinberg
law
in
respect
to
the
university
of
new
hampshire
if
it
wished
to
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire
which
i
mean
is
setting
up
the
board
to
give
organizations
opportunity
to
have
notice
and
hearing
and
so
forth
and
then
making
requirements
as
to
teachers,
i
think
it
could
make
amendments
to
the
present
law.
i
think
it
might
enact
immunity
statutes
on
the
state
level
if
it
wished
to
or
amendments
to
immunity
acts.
we
have
one
now
which
is
on
the
books.
i
think
it
might
seek
to
make
some
revisions
to
the
loyalty
oath
and
affidavit.
and
i
shall
certainly
recommend
that
we
amend
our
act
just
as
soon
as
i
get
back
in
new
hampshire
to
insert
the
words
"knowingly"
before
the
definition
of
subversive
person
even
though
they
exist
in
the
formula
which
this
court
has
approved.
and
i
think
that
we
should
have
them
in
there
so
as
to
clarify
that
point
and
not
leave
it
just
to
judicial
decisions.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
the
secretary
of
state,
state
officials.of
course,
under
the
law,
it
doesn't
quite
fit.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
that
is
patented
exactly
on
the
maryland
act.
before
i
sit
down,
i
--
i
would
like
to
point
out
the
decision
here
and
--
or
the
help
that
we
gave
or
tried
to
give
to
a
federal
committee
on
this
whole
relation
of
federal-state
partnership
in
an
investigation.
these
were
carried
as
to
the
white
hearings
by
the
senate
internal
security
committee
and
incorporated
many
papers
which
we
took
on
search
warrant
in
new
hampshire
at
the
request
of
the
internal
security
committee
in
the
exercise
of
our
function
and
in
partnership
with
the
federal
authorities.
we
feel
that
this
matter
of
investigation
is
one
which
could
be
helped
by
restrain,
careful,
protected
investigation
without
--
as
i've
tried
to
say
blunt
language,
your
honor,
pushing
anybody
around
and
we
hope
that
the
clear
decision
of
the
supreme
court
in
new
hampshire
make
--
meet
the
approval
of
this
court
in
the
review
of
this
case.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i
think
there
is
added
to
it,
your
honor,
by
force
and
violence.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
by
force
and
violence
does
apply
there
in
the
definition.
without
the
force
and
violence,
without
the
unlawful
means,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
no,
it
must
be
in
there.
if
it's
not
in
there,
it's
not
valid.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
oh
yes,
your
honor,
definitely
so.
