chief
justice
earl

were
any
of
the
questions
were
--
were
not
permitted
by
the
court,
questions
of
his
opinion
about
what
he
meant
by
his
lecture?is
there
anything
in
there
to
that
effect?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
he
intended
to
convey
to
the
students,
was
there
anything
of
that
kind
in
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
only
these
that
are
here,
on
these
pages.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
attorney
general
wyman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
general,
how
many
--
how
many
student
were
in
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
couldn't
find
anybody
to
testify
what
--
what
this
lecture
was?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
you
would
rather
probe
a
man's
mind
for
--
for
what
he
might
have
meant
than
to
--
than
to
probe
the
situation
to
find
out
what
he
said.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
that?
where
is
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
oh,
page
82.
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
general,
i
noticed
--
i
noticed
that
on
page
108,
there
are
--
there
are
questions
and
answers
that
interpret
this
--
this
quotation
that
you
have
just
read
to
us.
mr.
nelson,
"do
you
advocate
the
united
states
including
new
hampshire
to
be
a
socialist
state?”
“yes,
i
have
said
that
many
times.
it
is
on
the
record.
it
is
in
all
my
writings
over
the
years.
it
is
no
--
the
great
discovery,
i
am
a
socialist.
this
is
true.”
mr.
nelson,
"do
you
advocate
that
the
united
states
including
this
state
a
socialist
state,
be
integrated
with
the
union
of
soviet
socialist
republics?”
the
witness,
“no.
i
never
have
so
advocated.”
attorney
general
wyman,
"do
you
consider
and
do
you
take
the
position
in
you
writings
which
are
available
and
are
read
in
this
state
that
the
transition
from
a
capitalist
economy
to
a
socialist
economy
is
possible
without
force
and
violence?”
witness,
“yes.”
so,
it
isn't
quite
as
broad
as
--
as
just
the
quotation
that
you
read
would
indicate,
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
did
you
need
it
for?
i
thought
that's
what
you
read
it
for
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
emerson.
