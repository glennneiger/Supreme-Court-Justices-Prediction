mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire
upholding
appellant's
conviction
of
contempt
in
court.
the
contempt
arose
out
of
appellant's
refusal
to
answer
certain
questions
which
were
propounded
to
him
by
the
attorney
general
of
new
hampshire
acting
in
the
capacity
of
a
legislative
investigating
committee
which
was
investigating
subversive
activities
in
new
hampshire.
appellant
answered
all
the
questions
with
regard
to
the
user
advocacy
of
force
or
violence
to
overthrow
government
and
also
all
questions
with
respect
to
membership
or
influence
of
the
communist
party.
but
he
refused
to
answer
certain
questions
as
to
the
contents
of
a
lecture
on
socialism
which
he
had
given
at
the
university
of
new
hampshire
and
also,
on
the
activities
of
his
wife
and
two
others
in
the
formation
and
operation
of
the
progressive
party
in
new
hampshire.
the
basic
issue
is
whether
appellant
can
be
forced
by
a
state
legislative
investigating
committee
to
answer
questions
which
go
beyond
the
area
of
force
and
violence
and
communist
activity
and
would
seek
to
probe
into
the
area
of
academic
discussion
and
lawful
political
organization.
there
are
three
issues
on
the
merits.
first
amendment
issue,
a
due
process
issue,
and
the
question
whether
federal
legislation
has
preempted
the
field
under
the
pennsylvania
against
nelson
case.
there
is
also
a
jurisdictional
issue
and
the
court
postponed
consideration
of
jurisdiction
until
argument
on
the
merits.
since
that
order
of
the
court
was
issued,
i
think
the
jurisdictional
question
has
been
pretty
well
settled
by
a
certificate
issued
by
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire
which
appears
on
the
last
page
of
our
brief.
there
was
never
any
issue
with
respect
to
the
first
amendment.
that
issue
was
raised
from
the
beginning,
pressed
through
out
and
passed
upon
by
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court.
the
due
process
issue
if
i
--
i'm
--
i
should
say
that
when
i
refer
to
first
amendment,
i
--
i
mean
of
course
the
first
amendment
as
made
applicable
to
the
states
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
due
process
issue
was
presented
to
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
and
passed
upon
it
in
its
original
opinion.
the
only
question
arose
with
respect
to
the
preemption
issue.
this
question
for
reasons
which
i
need
not
go
into
here
was
not
presented
to
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
until
a
second
motion
for
rehearing
which
was
denied
by
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
without
opinion.
it
was
in
that
state
of
the
record
that
the
jurisdictional
statement
was
filed.
since
then,
however,
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire
has
issued
the
certificate
which
appears
on
page
78,
the
last
page
of
our
brief
in
which
they
say
they
certify
that
they
considered
on
the
merits
the
second
petition
for
rehearing
and
unanimously
denied
it
because
the
court
was
not
satisfied
that
pennsylvania
against
nelson
purported
to
preclude
a
state
legislative
investigation
of
subversive
activities.
in
light
of
the
rosenberg
against
california
and
similar
cases,
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
did
pass
upon
the
federal
question
and
passed
exclusive
and
rested
its
decision
in
fact
exclusively
on
the
federal
question.
and
that
therefore,
the
jurisdictional
issue
is
disposed
off.
i
might
add
that
the
position
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire
with
respect
to
this
preemption
question
was
considered
in
a
case
subsequent
to
the
sweezy
case
in
kahn
against
wyman
which
is
printed
in
our
brief
at
page
76.
and
that
in
this
case,
a
per
curiam
opinion,
they
did
consider
in
a
such
--
such
detail
as
i
wish
to
give
it
the
preemption
issue.
the
attorney
general
of
new
hampshire
raises
no
question
with
respect
to
jurisdiction.
now,
getting
to
the
merits
then,
it
would
be
necessary
for
me
to
develop
further
the
facts
with
respect
to
this
inquiry.
there
are
two
new
hampshire
statutes
involved.one
is
the
subversive
activities
act
of
1951
which
is
reprinted
in
our
brief
beginning
at
page
62.
this
statute
is
in
two
parts,
a
sedition
act
and
a
loyalty
program.let
me
summarize
it
briefly
without
attempting
the
full
refinement
of
the
legislation.
it
provides
that
it
shall
be
a
felony
punishable
up
to
20
years
in
prison
to
do
three
things,
commit
any
act
intended
to
overthrow
or
alter
the
constitutional
form
of
government
of
the
united
states
for
the
state
of
new
hampshire
by
force
or
violence.
two,
to
advocate
or
cage
by
any
means,
any
person
to
commit
or
assist
in
the
commission
of
such
an
act
or
violence.
and
third,
to
assist
in
the
formation
or
participate
in
the
management
or
contribute
to
the
support
of
any
--
of
any
subversive
organization
and
a
subversive
organization
is
defined
as
one
that
has
engaged
in
the
prohibited
acts
of
violence
or
in
the
prohibited
advocacy
or
teaching.
now,
for
our
purposes,
the
--
the
key
provision
of
the
statute
is
the
definition
of
subversive
person
which
appears
on
page
63.
a
subversive
person
is
defined
as
anyone
who
commits
any
of
the
prohibited
acts
or
engages
in
the
prohibited
advocacy
or
teaching
or
is
a
member
of
the
subversive
organization
or
including
a
foreign
subversive
organization.
the
chief
significance
of
the
definition
of
subversive
person
as
it
appeared
in
the
original
statute
here
was
in
relation
to
the
loyalty
program,
no
subversive
person
could
be
employed
in
the
state
government
but
the
definition
gave
--
added
significance
from
the
second
statute
which
i
will
--
that
i'll
mention.
the
loyalty
program
simply
provided
that
no
person
who
was
a
subversive
person
could
hold
public
office
or
be
employed
in
new
hampshire
and
was
enforced
--
enforced
through
investigatory
procedures
and
loyalty
oaths.
now,
the
second
statute
is
entitled
a
joint
resolution
relating
to
the
investigation
of
subversive
activities
was
passed
two
years
later
in
1953.
there
were
no
prosecutions,
as
i
understand
it,
under
the
1951
sedition
act.
but
in
1953,
the
legislature
passed
a
joint
resolution
of
investigation
and
this
authorized
and
directed
the
attorney
general
to
investigate
two
things.
one,
to
make
a
full
and
complete
investigation
with
respect
to
violations
of
the
subversive
activities
act
of
1951,
that
is
investigate
violations
of
the
1951
act.
and
two,
to
determine
whether
subversive
persons
as
defined
in
that
act
are
presently
located
within
the
state.
the
authority
to
investigate
subversive
persons
was
no
longer
limited
to
state
employees,
but
included
any
person
within
the
state.
the
attorney
general
was
given
the
subpoena
power,
but
it
was
enforceable
only
by
application
to
the
superior
court
of
new
hampshire
for
a
court
order.
now,
the
two
statutes
have
been
interpreted
by
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
in
a
decision
prior
to
the
sweezy
decision
involving
another
witness
before
the
attorney
general,
known
as
nelson
against
199
new
hampshire
33.
the
interpretation
was
that
the
--
the
1953
act,
the
resolution
of
investigation,
delegated
to
the
attorney
general
of
new
hampshire
the
legislative
power
of
investigation.
in
other
words,
that
he
was
not
conducting
the
investigation
acting
as
an
executive
official
but
acting
as
a
legislative
investigating
committee.
the
other
interpretation
was
this,
that
whereas
under
the
first
act,
no
felony
would
be
involved
without
knowledge
and
willfulness,
so
far
as
the
definition
of
subversive
person
was
concerned.
a
person
could
be
a
subversive
--
a
subversive
person
whether
or
not
his
action
or
advocacy
or
teaching
or
membership
was
knowing
and
willful.
in
other
words,
an
innocent
member
of
an
organization
would
come
within
the
definition
of
subversive
person
and
therefore,
be
subject
to
investigation,
so
much
for
the
statutes.
now,
appellant
was
a
resident
of
new
hampshire.he
was
a
graduate
of
harvard
and
obtained
his
doctor's
degree
in
economics
at
harvard
in
1937.
he
taught
on
the
harvard
faculty
for
eight
years
until
the
outbreak
of
the
war.he
went
into
military
service
and
at
the
end
of
military
service,
became
a
resident
of
new
hampshire
and
had
since
engaged
in
research
and
writing.
he
is
a
co-editor
of
the
journal
of
opinion,
monthly
review.
dr.
sweezy
is
a
distinguished
economist
and
a
well-known
authority
on
socialism.
he's
the
author
of
a
standard
text
on
socialism,
as
well
as
some
other
books
on
capitalism,
socialism
and
marxism.
in
political
orientation,
he
is
a
marxist
and
a
socialist.
dr.
sweezy
was
called
before
the
attorney
--
attorney
general
on
two
occasions,
in
january
and
june
1954.
in
an
opening
statement
on
the
first
occasion,
dr.
sweezy
made
clear
to
the
committee
his
position
with
respect
to
the
interrogation.
after
giving
his
reasons,
he
stated
that
he
would
answer
certain
questions
about
himself,
although
not
conceding
the
right
to
ask
them.
and
he
also
said
that
he
would
answer
questions
with
respect
to
force
and
violence
to
overthrow
the
government
but
not
other
conduct
which
he
considered
to
be
lawful
or
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
appellant
adhered
to
this
position
throughout
the
two
hearings
at
least
so
far
as
--
as
a
witness
under
those
circumstances
consistently
could.
he
answered
a
number
of
questions
in
line
with
this
pattern.
he
answered
all
questions
dealing
with
the
use
or
advocacy
or
force
and
violence.
he
testified
that
he
had
never
used
or
advocated
force
or
violence
or
assisted
any
group
which
advocated
force
or
violence
or
knew
any
person
in
new
hampshire
or
any
group
which
advocated
force
or
violence.
he
also
answered
questions
with
respect
to
the
communist
party.
the
1951
statute
had
contained
legislative
findings
of
fact
that
the
communist
party
engaged
in
acts
of
violence
and
other
similar
acts.
and
in
order
to
eliminate
the
question
of
the
relationship
of
the
communist
party
to
use
of
force
and
violence,
appellant
answered
questions
that
related
to
the
communist
party.
he
testified
that
he
was
never
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
was
not
at
the
time
a
member,
had
never
attended
any
meetings,
made
any
contributions
and
did
not
know
any
persons
in
new
hampshire
to
be
members
of
the
communist
party.
he
likewise
testified
with
respect
to
questions
concerning
communist
party
influence
on
the
progressive
party,
saying,
he
did
not
know
of
any
such
influence.
appellant
also
answered
a
number
of
questions
with
respect
to
himself.
he
testified
that
he
was
a
member
or
had
been
associated
in
some
ways
such
as
writing
or
making
speeches
for
a
number
of
organizations
listed
by
the
committee
on
un-american
activities
and
a
number
listed
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
he
testified
that
at
the
time
of
the
hear
--
that
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
he
was
not
a
member
of
any
organization
on
the
attorney
general's
list.
now,
the
attorney
general
of
new
hampshire
apparently
disagrees
with
some
of
these
statements
of
fact
i
have
made
with
respect
to
what
the
record
shows
as
to
the
testimony.
he
contends
that
my
statement
that
appellant
testified
with
respect
to
matters
concerning
force
and
violence
and
with
respect
to
advocacy,
membership
and
influence
of
the
communist
party
is
incorrect.
without
--
i
--
he
submits
no
specified
portions
of
the
record
in
--
to
support
his
statement,
except
these
two.
one,
a
question
which
was
asked,
“do
you
believe
in
communist?”
which
appellant
refused
to
answer
on
first
amendment
grounds,
although
he
later
answered
in
part.
that
is
a
question
of
belief
and
is
not
involved
here.
the
other
question
was,
“were
communist
--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
the
new
hampshire
courts
have
eliminated
by
saying
he
didn't
have
to
answer
those
questions.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
questions
with
respect
to
--
to
opinion
and
belief
including
which
would
include
this
question.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
no,
they're
not,
because
they
had
not
been
an
issue
and
you
have
to
read
the
whole
--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
yes.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
on
pages
11
and
--
beginning
on
page
11
of
our
brief.
i'll
--
i'll
indicate
that
in
a
moment.
i
--
i
merely
want
to
clear
up
this
question
or
fact
because
this
seems
to
me
is
a
--
is
a
crucial,
the
crucial
element
of
the
case.
the
other
point
that
the
attorney
general
cites
as
--
as
disputing
my
statement
with
respect
to
the
facts
is
the
question,
“were
communists
active
in
the
progressive
party
in
the
state?”
which
on
page
98
of
the
record,
appellant
refused
to
answer,
but
on
page
99
did
answer,
saying,
“no,
i
don't
know
of
my
own
knowledge
of
communist
in
new
hampshire.”
so,
that
question
was
answered
later.
i
therefore
stand
on
my
statement
of
the
facts
that
all
questions
with
respect
to
the
use
or
advocacy
of
force
and
violence
were
answered.
and
all
questions
except
belief,
questions
of
belief
with
respect
to
the
communist
party
were
answered.
now,
the
question
is
not
answered.
it
involved
as
i
have
said
first,
certain
ones
of
opinion
and
belief
which
the
superior
court
in
new
hampshire
held
it
was
not
necessary
for
appellant
to
answer
and
which
are
no
longer
subject
of
controversy
here.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
no,
there
was
no
fifth
amendment.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
no,
no
stage
with
the
fifth
amendment
claims.
now,
the
--
the
questions
as
i've
said
related
first
to
the
lectures
and
then
to
the
progressive
party.
the
lecture
was
a
lecture
given
at
the
university
of
new
hampshire
in
the
humanities
course.
a
regular
course
there
to
which
appellant
had
been
invited
for
three
years
to
lecture
on
question
of
socialism.
appellant
was
not
a
state
employee
or
otherwise
connected
with
the
university
of
new
hampshire.
he
was
a
guest
lecturer
on
the
question
of
socialism
at
the
humanities
course.
now,
he
testified
that
he
had
neither
in
his
lecture
nor
in
any
of
the
time
had
he
advocated
or
in
any
way
furthered
the
aim
of
overthrowing
constitutional
government
by
force
and
violence.
and
he
also
testified
that
he
had
not
advocated
communism
in
his
lecture.
the
questions
which
he
refused
to
answer
as
set
forth
on
page
11
and
12
were
these.
what
was
the
subject
of
your
lecture?
did
you
tell
the
class
that
socialism
was
inevitable
in
this
country?
did
you
advocate
marxism
at
any
time?
did
you
espouse
the
theory
of
dialectical
materials?
those
were
the
questions
that
he
refused
to
answer
with
respect
to
the
lectures.
now,
with
respect
to
the
progressive
party,
the
--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
yes.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
none
of
these
were
sustained.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
none
of
them.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
yes.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
that's
right,
yes.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
yes,
correct.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
those
all
deal
with
the
lecture.
there's
also
a
second
set
to
deal
with
the
progressive
party
which
are
on
page
13
and
14.
the
--
the
progressive
citizens
of
america
was
before
run-over
the
progressive
party
and
i
will
refer
to
them
both
as
the
progressive
party.
appellant
testified
that
he
did
not
know
any
communist
in
the
progressive
party
and
that
to
his
knowledge,
the
progressive
party
had
not
been
manipulated
or
influenced
by
the
communist
party.
there
was
no
allegation
that
the
progressive
party
was
a
subversive
organization,
although
the
attorney
general
says
that's
one
of
the
questions
he
is
investigating
but
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
it
was
subversive
or
in
anyway
unlawful.
now,
the
questions
with
respect
to
the
progressive
party
that
appellant
refused
to
answer
are
set
forth
on
13
and
14
and
they
were
these.
“was
nancy
sweezy,
your
wife,
active
in
the
formation
of
the
progressive
citizens
of
america?
was
charles
beebe
active
in
forming
the
progressive
citizens
of
america?”
a
question
with
respect
to
whether
appellant
had
had
a
conversation
with
abraham
walenko
about
the
progressive
party.and
the
fourth
question,
“was
charles
beebe
active
in
the
progressive
party
in
new
hampshire?”
those
were
the
questions
that
he
refused
to
answer.
now,
i
can
dispose
of
the
subsequent
proceeding
as
i
think
rather
quickly.
the
attorney
general
--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
yes.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
that's
because
they
were
sort
of
double
questions
relating
to
the
same
problem.
i
don't
think
--
with
the
exception
of
one,
your
honor,
on
page
13,
there
was
a
question.
“was
nancy
sweezy
then
working
with
individuals
who
are
members
of
the
communist
party?”
i
attest
over
that
because
as
i
explained
in
the
footnote,
he
had
answered
that
in
another
place
and
i
take
there's
no
objection
to
answering
again
if
your
asked
it.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
no,
that's
--
they
agreed
that
these
are
the
only
questions,
sir.
the
attorney
general
of
new
hampshire
then
petitioned
the
superior
court
of
new
hampshire
for
an
order
to
compel
appellant
to
answer
the
questions.
a
hearing
was
held
before
the
superior
court
and
the
superior
court
rule
as
i
have
said
that
he
need
not
answer
questions
relating
to
opinion
and
beliefs
but
that
he
must
answer
the
questions
set
forth
in
--
in
the
brief
with
respect
to
the
lecture
and
the
progressive
party.
appellant
refused
or
continued
his
refusal
to
answer
the
questions
and
the
superior
court
then
ordered
him
to
be
held
in
contempt
and
confined
to
the
county
jail
until
he
did
answer
the
questions.
he
was
admitted
to
bail.
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
new
--
new
hampshire
supreme
court.
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
ruled
that
the
questions
involved
were
relevant
under
the
new
hampshire
statutes.
and
two,
that
they
did
not
violate
appellant's
rights
under
the
first
amendment
or
the
due
process
clause
or
motions
for
rehearing
which
as
i
have
said,
raised
the
--
the
preemption
point.
now,
that
brings
me
to
the
merits
in
my
argument
on
the
first
amendment.
briefly,
my
argument
on
the
first
amendment
is
this.
the
first
amendment
is
applicable
as
a
limitation
on
the
power
of
state
legislative
investigating
committees.
and
the
standard
by
which
the
amendment
is
to
be
applied
is
the
standard
set
forth
in
the
quinn
case,
namely
that
a
legislative
committee
may
not
investigate
in
an
area
where
it
may
not
legislate.
and
thirdly,
that
in
this
case,
the
attorney
general
has
intruded
in
areas
which
would
be
foreclosed
to
state
control
by
the
first
amendment.
and
that
therefore,
the
--
the
appellant
was
justified
in
refusing
to
answer
the
questions
because
they
went
beyond
an
area
in
which
the
attorney
general
of
new
hampshire
was
constitutionally
authorized
to
investigate.
now,
let
me
develop
the
argument
a
little
further
and
then
attempt
to
answer
my
appellant's
contention.
i
take
it
that
it
is
unnecessary
to
deal
at
any
length
with
the
impact
upon
freedom
of
political
expression
in
actual
fact
of
the
operation
of
legislative
investigating
committees.
it
seems
to
me
that
experience
has
made
quite
clear
that
the
power
to
call
a
witness
before
a
committee
to
subject
him
to
a
series
of
questions
by
skilled
interrogators
and
then
to
publish
what
amount
to
official
government
findings
with
respect
to
his
conduct
or
actions
or
associations,
clearly,
impose
sanctions
upon
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
expression
and
freedom
of
association,
which
can
be
and
in
this
area
are
most
devastating.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
no,
your
honor.
this
--
this
was
--
initially,
this
was
a
private
hearing,
an
executive
session.
however,
attorney
general
had
power
to
make
public
after
the
hearings
a
transcript
to
the
testimony.
and
of
course
transcript
of
--
of
this
testimony
is
public
because
it
was
entered
as
part
of
the
record
in
the
superior
court.
in
addition
to
that,
the
attorney
general
issued
a
full
report
to
the
legislature
which
was
made
public
which
dealt
in
attempt,
purported
to
summarize
his
testimony.
that
repost
is
not
in
the
record,
it
was
--
but
i
take
it
it's
an
official
document.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
no,
no,
but
i
take
it.
justice
--
mr.
justice
harlan's
point
was
that
if
they
were
private
hearings,
this
impact
would
not
result,
but
i
--
i
think,
your
honor
that
even
though
the
hearings
may
be
initially
private,
much
of
the
impact
remains.
it
was
well
known
and
it
cannot
help
but
be
well
known
that
investigations
of
this
sort
are
going
on
and
the
testimony
did
become
public
and
would
inevitably
become
public.
now,
it's
--
it's
clear
that
there
were
this
sort
of
an
impact
in
this
case.
in
fact,
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire
expressly
stated
in
its
opinion
that
the
inquiries
undoubtedly
interfered
with
defendant's
free
exercise
and
celebrities
guaranteed
by
the
federal
constitution.
and
the
impact
was
--
here
occurred
in
particularly
delicate
fields
of
political
expression,
the
field
of
academic
discussion
and
field
of
political
organization.
i
have
set
out
in
the
brief
at
--
at
length
that
the
--
my
argument
with
respect
to
this
question
of
the
impact
upon
freedom
of
expression
of
legislative
investigations
and
i
won't
elaborate
it
further
at
this
time.
now,
under
these
circumstances,
it
is
clear
that
the
first
amendment
as
a
legal
matter
does
operate
as
a
limitation
upon
activity
of
this
sort,
and
this
i
think
was
clearly
held
in
the
rumely
case
and
was
reiterated
in
the
quinn
case
and
has
been
consistently
so
held
in
a
number
of
lower
federal
courts
in
which
the
issue
has
come
up.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
well
--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
well,
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
if
it
also
interferes
with
freedom
of
expression,
then
it
brings
into
the
picture
the
first
amendment
and
that
may
cut
off
the
--
the
inquiry
at
an
earlier
point
than
the
mere
question
of
relevancy.
that
--
that's
why
i
think
it's
significant
that
the
first
amendment
is
applicable.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
well,
but
--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
in
this
case
--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
in
this
case
--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
yes,
it's
quite
correct,
your
honor.
if
this
had
been
a
case
involving
a
federal
committee.
but
if
here,
the
--
this
was
a
state
legislative
investigation
in
which
the
court
--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
no,
your
honor,
but
maybe
with
respect
to
relevancy.
and
in
any
event
--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
yes,
exactly
and
these
questions
are
relevant.
so,
if
that's
all
that's
involved,
i'm
finished.
but
i
say
i'm
--
i'm
not
because
the
first
amendment
operating
through
the
fourteenth
operates
as
a
limitation.
now,
a
--
a
word
or
two
with
respect
to
the
legal
standard
or
doctrine
by
which
the
first
amendment
limitation
becomes
applicable.
there
are
various
theories
of
this
but
i
will
discuss
only
the
one
which
was
most
recently
stated
by
this
court
in
the
quinn
case
where
the
court
said
that
the
power
of
talking
there
of
congressional
legislative
investigation
does
not
extend
to
an
area
in
which
congress
is
forbidden
to
legislate.
this
was
in
line
with
mr.
chief
justice
hughes'
opinion
in
electric
bond
&
share
case
where
he
also
had
said
that
information
bearing
on
activities
which
are
within
the
range
of
congressional
power
may
be
subject
to
either
legislative
or
administrative
investigation.
the
standard
applies
also
to
the
states,
certainly,
where
the
states
purport
to
enter
an
area
that
is
forbidden
to
them
by
the
federal
constitution.
i
think
the
rule
is
a
sound
one
for
--
for
a
number
of
reasons.
let
me
just
state
this.
the
process
of
investigation
itself
as
i've
just
indicate
operates
as
a
restriction
or
a
regulation
particularly
in
the
field
of
first
amendment
pointer,
a
field
of
political
expression.
and
since
it
operates
as
a
restriction
or
a
legislation,
it
should
be
told
by
the
same
rules
with
respect
to
formal
legislation.
furthermore,
the
power
of
investigation
is
a
subsidiary
or
ancillary
power
to
be
exercised
only
in
aid
of
legislation.
and
therefore,
the
lesser
power
of
investigating
should
not
be
allowed
to
expand
beyond
the
greater
power
of
legislative.
now,
that
brings
me
to
the
question
of
the
application
of
this
area
standard
to
this
case.
i
am
willing
to
concede
that
there
may
be
cases
in
which
the
question
can
be
difficult,
but
i
submit
it
is
not
so
here.
first
with
respect
to
the
lecture.
as
i
have
said,
the
appellant
answered
questions
with
regard
to
use
or
advocacy
of
force
or
violence,
advocacy
of
communism.
the
other
--
other
testimony
in
the
record
indecently
supports
appellant's
testimony
on
this
point.
the
questions
with
regard
to
force
and
violence,
having
thus
been
answered,
the
attorney
general
went
on
and
asked.
“well,
what
did
you
say?
what
was
the
subject
of
your
lecture?
did
you
say
that
socialism
was
inevitable?
did
you
discuss
dialectical
materialism?”
and
so
on.
he
thereby
stepped
over
the
boundary
of
the
area
in
which
the
state
had
authority
to
legislate
and
proceeded
into
an
area
in
which
the
state
had
no
authority
because
it
was
dealing
with
academic
discussion.
the
state
has
authority
to
prohibit
force
and
violence,
and
under
the
doctrine
of
the
dennis
case
to
prohibit
the
advocacy
of
force
and
violence
under
certain
conditions,
but
it
has
no
power
to
limit
academic
discussion
of
--
of
--
along
peaceful
lines.
and
this
was
the
area
in
which
these
questions
intrude.
now,
let
me
make
one
subsidiary
point
here
before
i
pass
to
the
attorney
general's
answer.
this
was
not
an
investigation
of
the
curriculum
at
the
university
of
new
hamsphire
or
the
manner
of
teaching.
it
was
an
investigation
into
subversive
activities.
now,
true,
teachers
could
be
investigated
if
they
were
engaged
in
subversive
activities
as
well
as
anyone
else
but
i
want
to
emphasize
that
this
does
not
involve
the
power
of
the
state
to
make
rules
with
respect
to
the
curriculum.
it
doesn't
involve
the
question
of
whether
new
hamsphire
wants
socialism
taught
in
its
schools
or
--
or
to
discuss
in
its
schools
and
from
the
point
of
view,
whether
that's
sound
educational
policy.
that
the
attorney
general
had
no
power
in
that
field
and
the
supreme
court
of
new
hamsphire
expressly
recognized
so.this
is
a
question
of
his
power
with
respect
to
subversive
activity.
now,
the
attorney
general
has
two
arguments
in
answer
to
the
position
i
have
just
expressed.
the
first
is
that
appellant's
writings
and
associations
for
such
action
justify
a
further
pro.
the
argument
as
i
understand
it
is
that
appellant
is
the
kind
of
a
person
as
shown
by
his
writings
and
associations
that
he
has
a
propensity
to
advocate
force
and
violence
and
therefore,
you
can
inquire
further
about
what
he
said.
now,
i
--
i
will
not
discuss
this
in
any
detail.
i
think
i
would
simply
say
that
there
is
no
basis
in
either
fact
or
theory
for
this
argument.
there
is
nothing
in
appellant's
writings
which
indicate
in
anyway
that
he
ever
engaged
or
thought
to
engage
in
advocacy
of
force
or
violence
with
respect
to
the
united
states
government.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
if
--
if
the
--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
no,
not
quite
in
that
way.
the
appellant
answered
questions
as
to
what
he
had
--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
--
had
it
written
and
what
his
associations
were.
he
refused
to
answer
questions
all
with
respect
to
what
he
had
said
at
the
lecture.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
we
don't
have
that
case.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
and
i
would
--
and
i
post
that
for
--
not
necessary
to
the
window.
i
would
say,
"no
i'm
not
so
delighted
to
force
and
violence.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
oh,
yes,
yes.
i
would
agree
then
if
it
--
if
it
contained
evidence
of
force
or
violence.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
yes.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
well,
there's
an
area
in
which
he
contest
the
credibility
of
the
witness.i
--
i
agree
to
that
point.
and
that
brings
me
to
my
--
my
second
point
as
to
the
attorney
general's
argument
here.
his
--
his
position
is
that
he
contest
the
witness'
credibility
by
any
questions
which
are
relevant
regardless
of
whether
they
go
into
first
amendment
areas
or
not.
and
as
he
says,
the
mere
trace
of
relevancy
under
the
new
hampshire
statutes
authorizes
his
investigation
and
that
takes
precedence
over
any
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
now,
my
position
is
that
that
is
incorrect,
that
the
rule
of
the
area
test
is
that
when
you
cross
the
boundary
into
a
protected
area,
you
must
start
whether
it's
relevant
or
not.
and
that
here,
when
he
had
asked
the
questions
with
respect
to
advocacy
of
--
of
force
or
violence,
he
could
not
go
on
and
then
say,
“well,
what
did
you
say?”
because
that
is
so
clear
within
the
area
of
protected
freedoms
that
--
that
to
--
to
hold
that
you
can
go
into
that
area,
simply
nullifies
any
limitation
on
the
first
amendment.
now
--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
no.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
no,
no.
we
have
a
case
where
the
--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
yes,
based
--
and
the
witness
says,
“there
was
no
advocacy
of
force
or
violence,
no
advocacy
of
communism.”
there
are
certain
other
testimony
in
the
record
which
supports
this
position.
the
attorney
general
then
says,
“well,
if
you
didn't
--
well,
in
order
to
test
this,
i
must
ask
you,
what
did
he
say?
what
were
the
contents
of
the
lecture?
“that
is
the
--
is
the
question.
now,
i
say
--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
there
was
--
there
were
some
questions
not
what
he
meant
about
his
lecture
but
what
he
--
what
his
views
about
socialism
were
and
--
and
--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
well,
only
this
--
only
these
questions,
in
effect
what
contents.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
yes.
now,
let
me
just
make
one
or
two
further
points
with
--
with
respect
to
this.
even
if
you
assume
that
the
attorney
general
had
some
leeway
to
cross
the
boundary
in
order
to
get
at
something
that
might
show
some
light
on
the
permitted
area.
even
if
you
assume
that,
which
i
think
the
area
of
theory
is
not.
nevertheless,
the
attorney
general
went
much
too
far
in
this
case.
and
i
say
that
the
interest
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire
in
cross
examining
appellant
with
respect
to
these
matters
as
an
aid
to
legislation
on
this
questions
was
far
outweighed
by
the
damage
that
was
done.
if
the
attorney
general
wanted
to
prove
that
appellant's
answers
were
wrong,
he
had
the
possibility
of
a
perjury
of
prosecution.
and
the
perjury
prosecution
should
--
could
establish
the
integrity
of
a
legislative
investigation
in
this
sort
of
a
situation
if
it
were
called
for.
furthermore,
the
kind
of
questions
which
this
type
of
cross
examination
would
--
would
--
are
involved
are
not
the
kind
that
are
normally
necessary
to
a
legislative
committee
investigating
in
aid
of
legislation.
these
are
questions
which
go
to
the
details
of
particular
cases
which
might
be
relevant
in
an
adjudicatory
or
an
administrative
proceeding
dealing
with
particular
facts,
but
where
a
legislation
--
a
legislature
is
dealing
with
the
broad
facts
upon
which
to
establish
broad
legislative
policy,
it's
much
less
necessary
to
go
into
the
particular
individual
facts
of
--
of
a
--
of
a
particular
case
involving
cross
examination
to
test
the
answers
and
so
on.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
well,
that's
--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
that's
the
--
the
attorney
general's
argument
that
was
in
the
nature
of
cross
examination
to
test
the
validity
of
the
answer
of
that,
the
appellant
was
given.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
no.
it
was
not
cross
examination
in
the
--
in
the
accepted
sense,
your
honor.
i
--
it
was
merely
cross
examination.
i
mean,
it's
merely
an
analogy
to
cross
examination.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
i
think
--
i
think
not,
your
honor,
because
i
--
i
don't
think
that
this
is
a
kind
of
situation
where
the
normal
rules
of
cross
examination
applicable
and
in
a
--
in
a
case
before
a
court
dealing
with
an
adjudicatory
problem,
would
necessary
prevail.
now,
the
--
the
questions
with
respect
to
the
progressive
party,
i
think
stand
on
the
--
on
the
same
footing
and
i
think
i
can
and
will
have
to
dispose
of
them
fairly
briefly.
appellant
answered
all
questions
as
to
force
and
violence,
as
to
the
presence
of
communist
party
members
in
the
progressive
party,
as
to
the
influence
of
the
communist
party
on
the
progressive
party.
he
thereby
illuminated
or
--
or
answered
questions
that
dealt
with
the
area
of
--
use
or
advocacy
of
force
or
violence.
it
was
not
asserted.
he
--
he
--
well,
he
refused
to
answer
these
questions
as
to
whether
mrs.
sweezy
and
two
others
had
been
active
in
the
progressive
party.
it
was
not
asserted
that
any
one
of
those
three
were
members
of
the
communist
party
or
were
subversive
persons.there
was
nothing
in
the
record
which
indicated
that
they
were.
therefore,
the
questions
he
asked
dealt
with
ordinary
members
of
a
political
party
and
with
their
ordinary
activities
in
political
organization
and
consequently,
where
in
an
area
that
is
denied
to
the
state.
now,
the
attorney
general
makes
the
same
argument
that
these
questions
that
--
well,
he
makes
the
argument
that
he
had
in
his
possession
information
that
certain
communist
party
members
were
active
in
the
progressive
party.
and
therefore,
he
can
ask
as
to
whether
so
and
so
was
active
and
later
perhaps
tied
up
with
his
knowledge
about
someone
being
in
the
communist
party
and
therefore,
find
out
whether
there
were
communists
in
progressive
party.
but
on
that
theory,
if
the
court
please,
the
attorney
general
could
call
anyone
before
him,
ask
a
state
that
he
had
in
his
possession
that
there
were
some
members
of
the
republican
party
or
the
democratic
party
or
the
americans
for
democratic
action
or
any
organization
who
are
members
of
the
communist
party
and
then
say,
“how
about
so
and
so?
what
did
he
do
in
this
organization?
was
he
a
member?
how
active
was
he?”
now,
that
sort
of
--
of
extension
seems
to
me
clearly
goes
beyond
any
area
of
the
first
amendment.
now,
with
respect
to
the
due
process
issue,
i
have
to
say
only
this.
our
point
there
is
that
the
resolution
was
so
vague
and
so
uncertain
that
a
person
called
before
the
attorney
general
could
be
called
before
the
attorney
general
and
subjected
to
investigation
and
labeled
a
subversive
person
without
knowing
what
his
rights
were
and
would
not
know
at
what
point
he
could
stop
talking
before
the
attorney
general.
and
that
therefore,
it
violates
due
process
of
law.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
yes.
actually,
at
the
first
hearing,
he
did
not
--
he
had
a
--
he
did
not
have
counsel
because
his
counsel
was
busy
somewhere
else,
but
he
waived
that
he
had
counsel.
i
really
want
to
call
the
court's
particular
attention
--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
i'm
sorry?
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
i'm
attacking
--
mainly,
the
definition
of
subversive
persons
but
--
which
is
on
page
63.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
of
my
brief,
yes.
no,
wait
a
minute,
64.
now,
the
court
--
the
new
hamsphire
court
has
interpreted
this
definition
of
subversive
person
to
include
persons
who
were
--
who
committed,
who
engaged
in
the
advocacy
or
teaching
that's
involved
or
with
members
of
organizations
wholly
innocent.
that
is
it's
--
it
--
it
has
been
interpreted
in
the
way
that
the
loyalty
oath
was
interpreted
in
wieman
against
updegraff,
namely,
that
it
included
innocent
none-knowing,
non-willful
action
within
the
definition
of
subversive
person.
and
we
say
that
that
both
gives
the
attorney
general
and
a
fluent
unconfined
power
to
investigate
into
--
into
numerous
areas,
virtually
without
limitation.
and
that
it
also
results
in
the
arbitrary
application
of
sanctions
of
the
investigatory
process
to
innocent
membership,
that
is
to
say
that
just
as
wieman
against
updegraff
held
that
it
is
a
violation
of
due
process
to
deny
government
employment
to
an
innocent
member
of
this
--
of
an
organization.
so
here,
it's
a
denial
of
due
process
to
apply
the
sanctions
of
an
investigating
process.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
well,
then
--
then
--
since
the
power,
your
honor,
to
investigate
is
the
power
to
--
is
--
is
based
upon
these
provisions.if
those
provisions
were
unconstitutional,
then
there
would
be
no
power
to
investigate.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
yes,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
yes,
i
think
--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
i
think
that
--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
no,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
no.
that
--
that's
--
that
added
into
it,
but
--
but
i'm
saying
that
there
could
be.
i'm
--
i'm
certainly
not
saying
that
there
couldn't
be
legislation
which
would
be
sufficiently
definite
so
that
it
could
be
judged
at
least
reasonably.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
it
would
be
difficult,
yes,
but
--
but
this
is
impossible,
this
--
his
one.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
i
don't
think
--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
i
--
i
don't
think
that
would
help
me
in
advising
a
--
a
client
before
the
attorney
general.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
now,
i
just
want
to
say
a
final
word
about
my
last
point,
the
--
the
preemption
point.
there
are
two
aspects
to
this
without
going
into
this
again
in
any
detail.our
position
is
that
the
validity
of
the
resolution
of
investigation
depends
upon
the
validity
of
the
1951
act.
i
won't
develop
the
argument
for
that
is
in
my
brief.
i
would
simply
say
that
i
think
both
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
and
the
attorney
general
agree
that
the
--
the
statute
authorizing
the
investigation
is
based
upon,
predicated
upon
and
depends
upon
the
validity
of
the
1951
act.
therefore,
the
first
question
under
this
aspect
to
the
argument
is
whether
or
not
those
provisions
with
respect
to
sedition
in
the
1951
act
under
which
the
investigation
was
conducted
are
valid
under
the
doctrine
of
pennsylvania
against
nelson.
now,
on
that,
there
is
no
distinction
on
pennsylvania
against
nelson.
the
--
the
provisions
were
relatively
the
same.
they
--
they
dealt
with
the
question
of
sedition
involving
the
national
government,
the
federal
government.all
of
the
inquiry
involved
here
related
to
questions
of
--
of
sedition
on
a
nationwide
scale.
and
consequently,
those
provisions
of
the
act
of
the
new
hampshire
statute
which
were
involved,
and
the
investigation
conducted
under
them
fall
squarely
within
pennsylvania
against
nelson
and
no
further
extension
of
that
doctrine
is
necessary
here.
i
say
further
that
even
if
the
resolution
does
not
depend
upon
the
validity
of
the
prior
statute,
it
is
invalid
under
pennsylvania
against
nelson
because
it
is
in
aid
of
legislation.
its
only
--
its
--
its
only
sanction,
its
only
power
arises
from
the
fact
that
it's
in
aid
of
legislation.
but
this
legislation
under
pennsylvania
against
nelson
is
invalid.
therefore,
the
investigating
resolution
falls
also.
if
you
say
it
has
some
purpose
other
than
in
aid
of
legislation,
then
it's
a
regulation
and
likewise
falls
within
pennsylvania
against
nelson.
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
reserve
such
time
as
i
had
left
to
--
for
rebuttal.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
may
i
just
make
three
short
points.
first,
with
respect
to
the
publicity
issue,
the
report
of
the
attorney
general
appropriately
read
as
of
the
matter,
contains
more
than
20
pages
summarized
in
the
testimony
in
the
hearings
involving
the
appellant
in
this
case,
and
that
was
made
public
in
new
hampshire.
now,
your
honor,
if
i
may
attempt
to
clear
up
this
question
of
the
--
whether
the
question,
“do
you
believe
in
communism?”
should
have
been
included
among
the
unanswered
questions.
the
situation
there
refers
--
it
was
asked
by
the
attorney
general
before
the
court.
“now,
do
you
believe
in
communism?”
appellant
answered,
“if
communism
is
defined
as
in
the
new
hampshire
act,
no,
otherwise
i
won't
discuss
it.”
it
was
never
pressed
beyond
that
point.
then
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire
--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
then
he
went
on
to
another
question.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
the
--
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
in
its
decision
says,
“after
inquiries
which
related
to
opinion
and
beliefs
and
answers
to
hypothetical
questions,”
the
court,
meaning
the
lower
court,
ruled
that
these
were
not
relevant.
other
questions
were
being
relevant
and
then
they
went
ahead
and
discussed
only
the
lecture
questions
and
the
progressive
party
questions
which
are
included
in
my
brief.on
--
it
was
on
that
basis
that
i
assume
that
the
belief
question
had
dropped
out.
however,
if
--
and
this
is
the
first
time
the
attorney
general
has
suggested
that
the
belief
question
is
back
in.
if
so,
i
--
my
position
to
that
would
be
the
same
as
with
respect
to
the
other
questions
kept
more
--
even
more
clearly,
it
seemed
to
me,
the
question
as
to
belief
in
communism
is
--
is
within
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment
and
outside
the
area
of
legitimate
state
investigation.
may
i
add
just
one
other
thing?
the
appellant
in
this
case
attempted
to
draw
a
line
between
those
areas
in
which
the
state
had
an
interest
in
legislating
with
respect
to
political
expression,
and
those
areas
where
the
state
must
stay
out.
that
is
the
line
which
seems
to
me
extremely
important
for
this
court
to
recognize
and
--
and
confirm
so
far
as
it
can
be
made
clear
because
the
--
the
whole
development
of
political
expression
in
times
like
this
depends
upon
that
kind
of
distinction
and
not
apart
and
--
and
the
danger
of
blurring
over
that
distinction.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
the
distinction
between
what
a
state
may
legitimately
infringe
upon
or
interfere
or
control
in
the
field
of
political
expression
and
what
it
may
not.
the
distinction
specifically
in
this
case
being
the
distinction
between
force
and
violence
or
advocacy
of
force
or
violence
and
academic
discussion
or
lawful
political
organization.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
he
agreed.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
he
agreed,
but
agrees
with
us
in
theory,
not
in
facts.
