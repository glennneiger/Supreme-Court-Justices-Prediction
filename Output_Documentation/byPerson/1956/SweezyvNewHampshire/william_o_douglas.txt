what
is
--
what
is
the
relevancy
of
it,
of
the
secrecy
rather
than
the
public
hearing?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
if
a
question
violates
the
first
amendment,
it
still
violates
about
the
hearings,
executive
session
are
public.
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
that
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
where
--
where
is
that?
justice
william
o.
douglas
was
hearing
on
television
and
radio?
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
don't
think
that
mr.
emerson's
list
of
questions
is
complete?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
he
--
he's
--
works
on
the
same
record
that
you
work
on
and
he's
got
his
questions
from
the
same
record
that
you
get
your
questions
from?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
see.
is
that
the
only
one
that
he
considered?
justice
william
o.
douglas
apart
from
that,
then
his
list
this
accurate.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
apart
from
that
one.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
may
mean
no
more
than
we
better
--
better
find
out
what
this
thing
of
communism
is.
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
that
a
--
a
subject
that
new
hampshire
could
regulate
or
control?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i'm
sorry.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
i
don't
think
that
he
disavowed
that.
justice
william
o.
douglas
no,
on
page
205.
if
the
definition
and
characterization
of
communism
or
those
presented
in
the
preamble
of
the
1951
act,
the
answer
to
that
is
“no.”
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
so
far
as
--
so
far
as
the
--
as
tactics
go,
it
seems
to
be
whatever
he
may
think
of
the
end
results,
seem
fairly
mild
because
on
page
109,
he
says
he's
in
favor
of
compensation
for
all
privately-owned
means
of
production.
i
mean,
this
is
not
a
program
of
confiscation
that
he's
promoting.
