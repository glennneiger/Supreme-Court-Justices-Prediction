justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
interrupt?
when
you
say,
“it's
not
involved,”
the
attorney
general
did
not
press
that
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
questions,
what
questions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
those
questions
grouped
anywhere,
mr.
emerson?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
--
but
this
was
part
of
his
testimony.
these
are
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
some
questions
that
he
refused
to
answer
and
the
--
and
the
new
hampshire
court
sustained
the
refusal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
where
can
i
find
the
questions
that
were
pressed
by
the
attorney
general
but
rejected
by
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
was
it,
mr.
emerson?
i'm
looking
at
page
11
of
your
brief,
11
and
12.
justice
felix
frankfurter
q-a,
q-a.
the
first
q
was
refused
and
its
refusal
was
not
sustained
by
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire.
justice
felix
frankfurter
none
of
these.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then,
all
these
one,
two,
three
he
skips
them
i
think
and
all
of
these
are
questions
that
were
pressed.
while
he
was
asked
to
answer,
refused
to
answer
and
the
supreme
court
says,
should
answer
and
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
power
of
the
state
to
ask
these
questions
is
now
before
us?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
the
questions
from
11
through
down
the
middle
12,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
are
those
all
of
the
questions
we
have
before
us?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
the
questions
--
i'm
sorry
to
be
pestering
you.
the
--
the
questions
--
and
--
and
the
questions
on
pages
11
and
12
and
again
on
13
or
14
are
all
the
questions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
that
comprehends
them
all.
that's
the
line?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
go
--
i
gather
from
your
argument
that
you
established
in
a
compendious
way
that
asking
these
questions
has
an
adverse
effect
upon
freedom
of
expression
and
therefore,
it's
fair.i
should
suppose
the
real
question
was
in
--
was
in
a
territory
in
which
--
where
it
has
any
impact
or
not.
inquiry
can
be
foreclosed
rather
than
going
to
debating
whether
it
does
or
doesn't
cramp
your
style.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
they
have
no
business
to
ask
it,
it's
immaterial
whether
it
cramps
your
style?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
of
course,
it
can
inquire
apart
from
question
of
relevance
because
it
may
be
shut
off
by
the
freedom
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
if
it
does,
i
should
think
that's
an
end
of
the
matter.
i
just
wonder
you
prove
that
it
comes
within
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
whatever
is
infused
into
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
the
first,
i
don't
have
to
get
at
it
that
way
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
rather
than
the
other
way
around.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
this
is
an
area
--
if
this
is
an
area
which
cannot
--
about
which
there
can
be
no
legislation
and
there
can
be
no
enquiry.
why
do
i
have
to
weigh
whether
professor
mckee
was
right
or
sydney
hawk
is
right
but
it
doesn't,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
area
any
different
between
state
and
federal
so
far
as
freedom
of
speech
is
concerned?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
would
permit
as
to
the
relevance,
i
suppose
we
take
the
word
of
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
quite
follow,
the
attorney
general
leaving
after
he
made
the
disavowal.
the
attorney
general
didn't
say,
“doctor
sweezy,
i
hold
in
my
hand
a
pamphlet
published
by
xyz
and
i
read
the
following
under
your
name.
did
you
ever
write
that?
would
you
deny
to
do
that?
justice
is
the
credibility,
the
reliability
of
the
disavowal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
what
happened,
did
it
or
did
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
he
was
asked
what
he'd
said.
i
mean,
that's
why
it
seemed
to
me
so
important
to
pin
down
as
you
did,
as
you
have
done,
exactly
what
questions
--
to
what
questions
were
there
a
refusal?
and
he
did
ask
him
what
he
said
in
his
lecture,
but
would
you
agree
or
disagree?
would
you
deny
that
he
could
actually
confront
him
with
a
prior
document,
which
would
--
it
could
have
a
tendency
to
contradict
the
disavowal
he
just
made?
we
haven't
got
that
case,
haven't
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
assuming
that.
i'm
assuming
that.
i'm
assuming
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
something
that's
argued
for?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
there's
an
area
of
testing
the
credibility
of
the
witness
so
long
as
it's
done
with
the
usual
--
under
the
usual
rules?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
haven't
even
got
a
situation.
i
think
my
--
my
point
of
view
of
the
--
on
that
better
go
very
warily
in
this
business,
that
is
at
large.
this
isn't
even
a
case
where
the
attorney
general
asked
the
witness
after
appropriate
foundation.
is
it
or
is
it
not
a
fact
that
in
a
lecture
in
the
university
of
new
hampshire
on
january
22,
1952,
you
said
the
following
and
then
quoted.
“i'll
make
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
wild
hypothesis.”
you
then
quote,
supplying
for
him
in
citing
--
that's
a
bad
word,
a
plan
for
his
utterance
merely
saying
there
comes
a
time
when
you
can
resort
to
violence.
we
haven't
got
that
kind
of
a
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
you
ask
him
to
tell
him
what
he
said?
justice
felix
frankfurter
aren't
you
really
saying
on
your
due
process
point
and
the
vague
--
because
of
vagueness,
aren't
you
really
saying
that
the
freedoms
that
are
protected
that
are
--
that
are
covered
and
protected
by
the
due
process
clause
as
to
the
states
are
necessarily
--
they're
not
defined,
they're
indefinable,
that
they
involve
ultimately
in
a
conflict
between
or
accommodation
between
the
vast
powers
of
the
state
that
belong
to
it
by
way
of
legislation
in
the
auxiliary
power
to
investigate
before
you
legislate
or
against
the
limitation
that
is
implied
from
freedom
of
expression
of
association
that
is
--
that's
the
qualification
upon
that
and
that
is
not
ascertainable
in
advance,
that's
a
difficult
and
delicate
subject
in
--
in
the
realm
of
--
ultimately
of
judgment
of
those
who
have
the
last
say
and
therefore
inherently,
this
is
so
vague
and
nobody
can
tell
in
advance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
effect?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
limitations
which
the
freedoms
guaranteed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
apply,
supply
are
insufficient?
justice
felix
frankfurter
upon
the
subject
of
it,
determine
what
they
are?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
would
have
a
hard
job
even
with
you
skill
unfavorably.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
they
could
amend
all
this
power
of
investigation
conferred
upon
the
attorney
general,
is
of
course
subject
to
the
limitations
which
the
fourteenth
amendment
places
upon
inquiry
and
further
his
subject
with
the
hospitable
attitude
that
should
be
taken
in
construing
such
limitations.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
would
be
quality
with
that,
would
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
you
could
help
him
anymore
than
you
have
helped
him,
no
matter
what
you
helped.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
other
way
around
too,
attorney.
if
these
questions
won't
be
denied
power
of
--
to
be
answered.
it's
made
by
--
by
a
legislative
committee
on
the
score
of
constitutionality,
not
on
the
score
of
relevance
under
the
order.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
they
were
barred
because
of
constitutionality,
they
wouldn't
be
the
less
barred
although
ordered
to
be
answered
by
a
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
there
might
be.
i
understand
that,
but
if
--
if
it
found
it's
relevant
but
limited
by
the
--
if
it
were
to
be
found
to
be
irrelevant
but
denied
response
because
of
the
constitutional
limitation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
it
would
by
you
or
by
a
committee
of
your
legislature
on
that
ground.
that
hurdle
couldn't
be
cleared
by
a
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
might
be
--
there
might
some
--
be
some
questions,
procedural
due
process
that
might
be
involved,
secrecy
and
absence
of
counsel.
i'm
not
saying
there
are,
there
could
be
which
would
be
taken
care
of
if
done
the
way
you
did
it
in
new
hamsphire
based
on
the
original
proceeding
in
the
branson
case
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
this
is
based
on?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
haven't
brought
to
another
difficulty,
have
you,
that
you
--
this
is
--
this
is
an
incursion
on
the
field
of
press,
how
can
you
deny
them,
tv
and
everything
else?
that's
not
by
our
trouble,
but
you
haven't
had
that
trouble.
you
might
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
none?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
reflected
the
normal
new
hampshire
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
furnished
--
has
furnished
to
whom?
justice
felix
frankfurter
speaking
of
public
figures.
justice
felix
frankfurter
printed
somewhere?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
attorney
general,
in
the
interest
of
convenience,
i
wonder
if
you
do
this.
mr.
emerson,
if
i
did
not
misunderstand
him
and
i
thought
he
was
clear,
told
us
that
the
question
in
dispute,
the
questions
that
were
asked
and
to
which
answers
refused,
are
those
set
forth
in
his
brief,
pages
11
and
12,
one
set,
and
pages
13
and
14,
another
set.
i
have
looked
at
your
brief
any
more
than
i
read
his
brief.
did
you
mess
the
questions
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
are
before
us.
we
all
give
two
layers
likely,
if
i
may
say,
ought
to
be
able
to
agree
what
questions
were
asked
and
that
were
asked.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
201
to
209,
you
just
read.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
--
the
court
--
the
--
your
court,
supreme
court
certainly
didn't
mess
into
the
superior
courts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
as
i
also
understood
it,
unless
i'm
corrected,
some
questions
are
disallowed
by
your
supreme
court,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now,
so
that
raises
a
question.
what
questions
fall
under
that
ban?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
--
would
you
mind
if
the
chief
justice's
agreement
to
--
could
you
do
that
without
trouble,
actually
set
forth,
seriated
the
questions
that
you
think
have
been
ordered
to
be
answered
by
your
court
and
that
are
none
--
scrutiny
by
this
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
--
could
you
do
that
before
you
go
back
to
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
the
record
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
are
you
reading
from
now?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
lasting
and
(inaudible)
word,
where
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
yes.
that's
his
answer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
go
ahead,
yes
i
see.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understand
what
you
are
doing
now,
is
it
or
is
it
not,
namely,
that
you
--
you
--
as
you
indicated
that
the
questions
must
be
read
in
the
context
of
things
that
aren't
objectionable
questions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
--
that's
what
you
are
saying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
line
your
argument
as
taken.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
can
but
does.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
heart
your
added
subversion
policy,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
force
and
violence,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
difficulties
of
--
if
you
let
me
say
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
difficulties
about
this
kind
of
question,
i
don't
mean
constitutional
difficulties
about
this.
but
when
he
says,
russia,
the
communist
country,
only
one
that
have
communism
in
the
sense
that
i
talk
about.
difficulties
is
that
a
man
--
maybe,
he
may
have
meant
for
all
i
know
or
when
maybe
economic
aspect
of
communism
and
not,
he
operate
as
a
coercion,
the
denial
of
civil
liberties
because
the
--
the
present
leader
of
the
opposition,
great
britain
says,
“he
is
a
socialist.
he
is
a
marxist,”
as
he
believe
in
the
body
of
economic
doctrine
which
may
or
may
not
be
valid,
which
may
not
--
not
come
to
pass.
but
to
make
a
prophecy
that
they
will
come
to
pass
would
be
outside
as
i
understand
it,
your
--
your
policy
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
that
that
is
subversion.
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
so,
these
--
these
words
to
the
vantage
about
are
so
--
are
so
--
what
shall
i
say,
have
so
many
meanings.
it
is
so
ambiguous.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
when
a
man
says,
"i'm
a
communist
in
--
in
a
sense
in
which
i
mean
it,
communists
exists
in
communist
countries."
he
may
be
as
passionate
about
the
civil
liberties
as
--
as
to
say
that
delayed
professional
asking
wasn't
--
he
got
in
himself
as
a
less
being
socialist.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
shed
some
light
--
i
thought
i
could
believe
as
i
keep
on
reading
your
record.
there's
a
colloquy
with
you.
because
he
answers
to
you
on
page
85.
it
seem
to
be
almost
forthcoming,
particularly
when
you
asked
him
these
questions
and
tells
you
what
it
is
and
relies
on
--
but
let's
assume
(inaudible)
of
interesting
reliance
from
that
also
or
from
dr.
sweezy's
outlook?
but
they're
not
(inaudible)
he
defined
what
he
means
by
inevitable.
that
that's
just
what
he
--
that's
a
point
of
view.
that's
a
belief
that
students
aren't
stupid.
would
you
like
to
testify
to
that,
mr.
attorney
general?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i
get
the
impression
more
than
the
identical
serious
impression
that
the
witness
rarely
wanted
to
raise
a
general
proposition,
namely
--
namely,
may
the
state
of
new
hampshire,
even
for
the
purposes
--
for
the
purposes
of
anything,
may
it,
as
a
teacher,
whether
he's
a
permanent
teacher
or
just
lecturer.
may
it
ask
him
to
tell
an
investigating
committee,
and
i
--
by
the
same
token,
i
think
the
court
--
"what
did
you
tell
your
class
yesterday?"
he
rarely
wanted
to
raise
in
a
way
that
--
that
general
question,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
clearly
what
it
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
resolution
on
--
the
resolution
under
which
you
are
operating
by
your
legislature,
did
that
--
was
that
the
record
towards
inquiry
whether
there
was
a
danger
of
subversion
to
the
government
of
united
states
and
the
government
of
new
hampshire?was
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
government
of
united
states
was
mentioned
too.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
subversive
activities
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
referred
both
subversion
against
the
united
states
and
the
supreme
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
your
view
of
the
--
the
effect
of
this
court's
decision
in
nelson
upon
your
legislation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you're
not
because
we
are
in
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
of
your
view
as
left
in
the
light
of
the
nelson
decision
as
you've
stated
it,
i
think
fairly.
that's
the
defense
you've
stated.
what
is
there
left
on
which
new
hampshire
could
legislate
so
long
as
the
nelson
case
stands
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
requested
by
congressional
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
inquiry
--
inquiry
has
at
least
the
ultimate
aim
of
some
legislation,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yours,
but
i
understand
you
to
say
that
your
loyalty
oath
act,
who
has
to
take
that,
state
officials,
teachers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
is
that
--
is
that
apart
from
the
maryland
act
as
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
the
statute
was
dropped
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
go
ahead.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
repeating
what
distinction
you
suggest
to
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
trouble
is,
attorney
general
that
agreed
with
you
on
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
agrees
with
that
proposition.
