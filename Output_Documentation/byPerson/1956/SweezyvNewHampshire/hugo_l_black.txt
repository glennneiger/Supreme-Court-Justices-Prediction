suppose
you
were
right
in
your
attack
on

section,
what
effect
would
that
have
on
the
right
of

asked,
“do
you
believe
in
communism?”
he

was
recognized
by
the
supreme
court,
your
state
supreme
court
as
one
of
the
grounds
for
sentencing
him
for
contempt.
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
--
you
think
when
you
have
a
secret
--
forbid
anyone
to
say
that
they
thought
socialism
was
inevitable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
what
you
understand
this
to
mean
and
yours
--
such
as
to
finding
felony.
i
just
read
a
part
of
it.
"it
shall
be
a
felony
for
any
person
knowing
and
willfully
to
commit
any
act
intended
to
alter
the
constitutional
form
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
or
the
state
of
new
hampshire."

is
there
to
destroy
or
alter?
i
don't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
you
do
but
i
don't
--
i
mean
it's
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
have
the
words
of
--
but
you
have
the
permit
--
attempt
to
permit
or
aid
in
the
commission
of
any
act
intended
to
overthrow
and
destroy
our
government.
and
you
would
--
you
would
limit
that
to
the
course
involved?
