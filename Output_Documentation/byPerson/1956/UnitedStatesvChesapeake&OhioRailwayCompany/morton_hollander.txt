mr.
morton
hollander
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
like
number
19
originated
as
an
action
by
the
carrier,
chesapeake
&
ohio
railway,
against
the
united
states
in
the
district
court.
there,
too,
the
claim
was
that
the
county
had
not
been
paid
enough.
this
is
--
this
is
the
factual
situation
in
--
in
number
19,
chesapeake
&
ohio.
in
december,
late
december
1941
right
after
pearl
harbor
and
in
the
early
part
of
the
next
month,
january
1942,
the
government
moved
over
chesapeake
&
ohio's
lines
approximately
50
carloads
of
military
automative
equipment.
the
destination
for
these
military
supplies
was
china.
it
was
to
be
shipped
to
china
through
rangoon.
for
the
domestic
leg
of
the
movement,
the
goods
were
transported
from
their
point
of
origin,
pontiac,
michigan,
to
the
seaport
at
newport
news
whence
there
were
supposed
to
be
shipped
through
rangoon
to
china.
prior
to
the
movement
of
these
50
carloads
of
military
supplies
from
pontiac
to
newport
news,
the
government
had
made
all
the
necessary
arrangements
through
the
office
of
defense
transportation
which
coordinated
all
domestic
rail
and
overseas
ship
traffic.
they
had
made
arrangements
through
the
odt.
they
had
obtained
the
necessary
releases.
they
had
assured
themselves
a
sufficient
cargo
or
vessel
space
at
the
newport
news
destination
at
the
seaport
from
which
they
were
going
to
be
shipped
to
rangoon
and
then
to
china.
the
goods
were
at
--
the
goods
arrived
at
newport
news
in
due
course.
they
were
there
for
a
matter
of
two
or
three
weeks
when
--
on
march
8
--
march
8,
1942.
march
8,
1942,
rangoon
fell
to
the
japanese.
so
this,
of
course,
made
it
impossible
for
the
government
to
ship
the
goods
from
the
overseas
port
at
newport
news
onto
china.
the
goods
were
--
at
that
time
moved
to
inland
storage
centers
where
they
stayed
for
approximately
two
or
three
months
and
then
a
year
later,
they
were
transshipped
across
the
united
states
to
california.
and
at
that
point
from
that
port
from
wilmington,
california,
they
were
exported
to
india.
the
tariff
rate
question
in
this
case
arises
--
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
they
were
shipped
back
in
the
middle
of
1943.
the
tariff
rate
question
in
this
case
arises
with
respect
to
the
movement,
the
original
movement
from
pontiac,
michigan
to
the
original
overseas
port,
newport
news,
where
the
overseas
transportation
was
frustrated
by
the
fall
of
rangoon.
the
carrier
claims
that
they
are
entitled
to
the
higher
domestic
rate
which
applies
to
a
shipment
of
that
sort
because
they
say
the
goods
did
not
leave
the
united
states
from
newport
news,
the
original
consignment
port.
the
government's
position
in
this
--
in
this
litigation
has
been
that
--
now,
it's
--
it's
unfair,
it's
unreasonable
to
apply
the
high
domestic
rate
in
a
case
of
this
sort
where
the
overseas
exportation
has
been
frustrated
by
war
or
by
any
other
circumstance
beyond
the
shipper's
control.
the
government
insisted
that
the
lower
export
rate
should
apply,
a
rate
considerably
less
than
the
domestic
rate.
the
government,
in
other
words,
contented
that
the
lower
export
rate
for
the
movement
from
--
in
pontiac,
michigan
to
newport
news
should
apply.
the
record
--
the
record
shows
very
clearly
that
these
goods
would
have
followed
through
on
the
original
plan
and
have
been
exported
from
newport
news
to
rangoon
to
china
had
not
--
burma
had
been
conquered
by
the
japanese
in
march
of
1942.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
precisely
the
--
the
basic
issue
on
the
tariff
rate
question
in
both
the
district
court
and
in
--
and
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
--
mr.
morton
hollander
the
government's
position
is
that
these
subsequent
events
occurring
after
the
goods
arrived
at
the
original
consignment
port
have
no
bearing
on
the
government's
eligibility
for
the
export
rate
on
the
initial
shipment
because
the
government
certainly
had
a
bonafide
intent
to
export
that's
conceded.
the
government
had
made
all
the
necessary
arrangements,
had
taken
all
--
had
taken
all
possibly
diligent
precautions
to
assure
itself
a
vessel
space
from
newport
news
to
rangoon
only
the
--
the
only
factor
of
frustrating
the
shipment
was
the
circumstance
completely
beyond
its
control.
mr.
morton
hollander
none
--
none
whatsoever,
your
honor,
none
whatsoever.
the
icc
in
fact
because
of
that
has
consistently
ruled.
it's
consistently
ruled
that
in
circumstances
of
this
sort
where
the
shipper
exercises
reasonable
diligence
to
assure
himself
of
adequate
cargo
space
at
the
consignment
port
and
where
the
shipment
does
not
move
overseas
because
of
some
circumstance
beyond
his
control
like
war,
the
africa
war
in
1939
is
the
first
icc
case
we
rely
on.
the
goods
were
completely
domesticated
there.
they
never
did
go
overseas
from
any
port.
they
remained
in
the
united
states.
the
icc
has
consistently
ruled
that
when
you
have
those
two
factors,
you
have
a
bonafide
intent
to
export,
you
have
reasonable
diligence
in
assuring
necessary
cargo
space
prior
to
the
time
the
goods
move
out
over
the
rails
to
the
consignment
port.
in
--
in
those
--
in
that
situation,
the
icc
has
consistently
ruled
that
it
is
unreasonable,
it
is
unfair
to
the
shipper
to
require
him
to
pay
the
higher
domestic
rate.
now,
we
relied
on
those
icc
rulings
in
the
courts
below.
we
said
that
on
the
basis
of
those
icc
rulings,
we
were
entitled
to
a
ruling
from
the
court,
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
that
we
should
have
to
pay
no
more
than
the
export
rate.
we
further
contended
in
the
courts
below
that
if
the
court
was
not
ready
to
give
full
effect
for
the
commission
decisions
on
unreasonableness
of
application
of
the
high
domestic
rate
in
these
circumstances,
if
the
court
was
not
ready
to
give
effect
to
those
commission
decisions,
then
we
requested
the
court
to
stay
the
proceedings,
refer
the
question
of
reasonableness
of
application
of
these
high
domestic
rates
to
these
frustrated
freight
shipments,
refer
that
question
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
await
administrative
commerce
commission's
resolution
of
that
issue.
what
the
court
below
did
was
to
say
that
they
were
to
view
that
they
were
not
ready
to
apply
the
icc
decisions
on
unreasonableness.
in
fact
as
they
saw
it,
as
they
read
those
decisions,
it
was
perfectly
permissible.
there
was
nothing
unreasonable.
the
court
below
ruled
in
applying
the
higher
domestic
rates.
with
respect
to
our
request
that
the
proceedings
be
stayed
so
as
to
afford
us
an
opportunity
to
go
before
the
commission,
have
the
commission
itself
apply
its
own
rulings
unreasonableness
for
the
situation.
there,
the
court
of
appeals
too
raised
its
hand
like
the
court
of
claims
did
in
number
9
--
in
number
18
and
said,
“we're
very
sorry,
very
sorry,
two-year
period
of
limitations
has
gone
by.”
the
commission
has
that
power
to
entertain
any
referral
and
we
will
not
refer
the
case
to
it.
now,
in
the
--
the
date
sequence
in
--
in
the
chesapeake
&
ohio
case
is
this.
the
shipments
as
i
pointed
out
were
made
in
1941,
later
part
of
december
1941
and
early
of
january
1942,
the
shipments
in
question,
that
is
the
movement
from
pontiac,
michigan
to
the
newport
news.
the
government
defected
--
and
the
--
the
carriers
billed
the
government
at
the
high
domestic
rates.
in
compliance
with
the
mandate
of
the
transportation
act
of
1940,
the
government
made
prompt
payment
of
those
high
domestic
rates.
the
gao
was
in
a
position
to
audit
these
bills
in
1946,
approximately
four
years
later.
at
that
time,
gao
determined
that
there
was
an
overcharge
that
we
should
have
paid
only
the
export
rate
and
effected
recoupment
by
deductions
from
other
bills
submitted
by
chesapeake
&
ohio
in
1946.
six
years
later,
1952,
almost
exactly
six
years
later
after
these
deductions
were
effected
in
the
record,
and
this
case
is
very
clear,
chesapeake
&
ohio
comes
into
court,
into
the
district
court
and
contests
the
correctness
of
the
deduction,
the
--
the
gao's
position
that
there
had
been
an
alleged
overpayment
when
they
initially
received
payment
on
the
basis
a
higher
domestic
rate.
mr.
morton
hollander
there,
as
in
this
case,
the
carrier
--
there
as
in
the
earlier
case,
the
carrier
waited
for
more
than
two
years
to
go
by,
then
it
could,
as
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
ruled
and
as
the
court
of
claims
in
the
earlier
case
held,
it
was
in
a
position
to
deprive
the
government
of
its
right
and
actually
to
--
to
establish
its
defense
of
unreasonableness
of
application
of
the
domestic
rates
to
these
shipments.
the
--
the
government's
hands
were
tied
under
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
the
passage
of
that
two-year
period
of
time
while
barring
the
right
of
the
government
to
obtain
a
referral
in
no
way
affects
the
carrier's
right
to
file
a
suit.
the
carrier
could
come
as
much
as
six
years
later,
lot
of
carriers
come
in.
however,
the
fact
that
the
two-year
period
of
limitations
prescribed
by
section
16
(3)
of
interstate
commerce
act
had
elapsed
--
had
elapsed
that
the
time
the
carrier
came
into
court.
that
fact
prevented
the
government
as
a
shipper,
as
a
defendant
from
going
to
the
icc
to
establish
the
unreasonableness
of
the
rate.
in
other
words,
under
the
opinions
of
both
of
these
courts,
it
is
up
to
the
plaintiff
carrier
to
dictate
and
to
control
the
type
of
defense
which
may
be
asserted
by
the
government
as
a
shipper
defendant.
the
carrier
has
no
such
right
of
control
or
the
case
with
respect
to
the
private
shipper.
as
far
as
the
private
shipper
is
concerned,
the
carrier
is
forced
to
come
into
court
within
two
years
to
file
its
--
its
complaint
against
the
shipper.
and
as
i
pointed
out
earlier,
even
if
the
carrier
as
far
as
the
private
shipper
is
concerned,
waits
until
the
very
last
day
of
that
two-year
period.
the
expiration
of
that
two-year
period
does
not
bar
the
shipper
from
getting
before
the
icc
on
a
case
arising
out
of
the
same
transportation
service
because
section
16
(3)
(b)
of
the
act
explicitly
gives
the
shipper
an
additional
90
days.
if
the
carrier
should
wait
until
the
last
day
of
the
two-year
period,
then
the
shipper
is
accorded
an
additional
90-day
period
beyond
the
expiration
of
two-year
period
within
which
he
can
take
advantage
of
a
proceeding
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
that
admiral
relief
is
not
open
to
the
government.
as
i
say
in
this
case
as
in
the
earlier
case,
it
is
up
to
the
carrier
that
the
whim
of
the
carrier,
if
the
carrier
wants
to
collect
unreasonable
charges
from
the
united
states
as
a
shipper,
if
it
wants
to
collect
these
unreasonable
charges,
all
it
have
to
do
under
both
of
these
opinions
is
wait
for
the
two-year
period
to
go
by,
then
file
suit
against
the
government
and
the
government
is
--
is
completely
barred
from
asserting
its
defense.
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
as
i
try
to
suggest
with
--
with
all
due
deference
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
option
is
completely
an
illusory
one
as
far
as
the
government
is
concerned
because
there's
really
no
need,
no
warrant,
no
justification
for
the
government
to
go
trembling
over
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
every
time
it
gets
a
bill.
and
congress
has
reserved
to
the
government
the
explicit
right
of
recoupment
by
deductions
of
overpayments
from
later
bills.
and
i
think
it
would
be
quite
appropriate
for
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
say
that
the
--
the
government
hasn't
exercised
the
statutory
right
conferred
upon
it
by
congress.
it
shouldn't
bother
the
icc
until
it's
done
that.
mr.
morton
hollander
no
--
mr.
morton
hollander
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
the
government,
of
course,
is
the
largest
shipper.
i
don't
know
how
many
thousands
or
hundreds
of
thousands
of
--
of
bills
are
processed
annually
--
mr.
morton
hollander
well
--
mr.
morton
hollander
i
--
i
know
--
mr.
morton
hollander
well
i
--
mr.
morton
hollander
without
knowing
any
statistics,
your
honor,
i
can
--
i
can
safely
venture
the
thought
that
the
--
the
task
confronting
gao
is
really
one
of
herculean
proportions,
so
that
--
i
know
that
they
have
--
i
know
that
they
have
a
division,
a
whole
division
of
transportation
over
there,
a
whole
division,
the
general
accounting
office,
that
does
nothing
but
work
on
these
carrier
claims
and
carrier
bills.
and
it's
--
it's
because
--
it's
because
there
aren't
so
many
of
these
bills,
your
honor,
that
the
carriers
themselves
in
1940
insisted
the
congress
that
it
enact
this
transportation
act
so
that
it
doesn't
have
to
wait
until
--
mr.
morton
hollander
it's
not
--
mr.
morton
hollander
that's
performance.
mr.
morton
hollander
that's
--
that's
--
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
we
--
we
believe
the
--
the
minimum
relief
were
--
were
entitled
to
his
--
certainly
is
to
have
the
interstate
commerce
commission
pass
on
the
reasonableness
of
what
was
done
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
court,
number
19
and
what
was
done
to
us
in
the
court
of
claims
in
the
--
in
the
earlier
cases
in
the
way
of
applying
these
higher
first
class
rates.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
in
--
well,
let
me
say
this,
your
honor.
first,
in
--
in
the
other
cases,
there
is
no
such
question.
everybody
concedes
and
the
court
of
claims
recognized
that
we
had
a
right
to
have
this
particular
issue
of
reasonableness
determined
by
the
commission.
and
they
said
that
we
would
have
referred
it
but
for
the
expiration
of
the
two-year
period.
mr.
morton
hollander
everybody
agreed.
mr.
morton
hollander
no,
in
the
--
in
the
first
case,
in
the
bond
cases.
i
am
coming
to
this
--
mr.
morton
hollander
--
this
case
right
now.
in
the
other
cases,
there's
no
problem.
the
court
of
claims
explicitly
recognized
our
right
to
have
that
particular
question
adjudicated
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
but
it
said
two
years
is
too
late.
in
this
case
--
in
this
case,
the
--
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
indicates
its
doubt
as
to
whether
or
not
the
question
of
domestic
versus
export
is
one
properly
raising
a
question
of
reasonableness
appropriate
exclusively
rights
to
see
determination.
our
--
our
argument
on
that
aspect
of
the
case
is
simply
this,
that
the
icc,
as
i
pointed
out,
is
consistently
ruled
in
a
number
of
cases
involving
those
same
two
operator
facts.
the
arrangement
for
the
cross
--
the
continental
domestic
shipment
coordinated
with
the
vessel
space
already
arranged
for
prior
to
the
time
the
goods
are
even
shipped
from
the
original
point
of
shipment,
the
icc
has
consistently
ruled
in
those
cases
that
the
application
of
the
high
domestic
rate
is
unreasonable.
and
we
were
urging
upon
the
lower
court
that
this
question
of
reasonableness
which
is
one
appropriate
for
icc
determination
has
in
fact
already
been
passed
upon
by
icc
in
these
other
cases.
so
we
ask
the
court
to
apply
it
and
we
pointed
out
to
the
court,
but
the
icc
is
--
has
already
ruled.
if
you
apply
the
high
domestic
rates
here,
it's
unreasonable
on
--
on
the
basis
of
at
least
five
cases
holding
to
that
effect
since
world
war
ii.
we
also
pointed
out
that
if
the
court
was
unwilling
to
accept
our
reading
of
the
icc
decision,
which
on
their
face
plainly
stated
that
the
application
of
the
domestic
rate
was
unreasonable,
if
the
court
was
unwilling
to
accept
our
reading
of
the
icc
decisions,
then
we
thought
that
the
least
we
were
entitled
to
was
to
have
the
court
to
ship
the
matter
all
to
the
icc
and
let
them
decide
for
ourselves
whether
or
not
we
read
those
cases
correctly.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
if
may,
i
would
--
mr.
morton
hollander
if
i
may,
i
would
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
address
myself
to
that
question.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
sir.
may
i
answer
that
question
briefly
rather?
mr.
morton
hollander
the
--
that
--
that
aspect
--
that
aspect
of
the
case
goes
to
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
its
apt,
its
proper
to
characterize
the
particular
question
in
this
chesapeake
&
ohio
case
is
one
of
reasonableness
which
is
one
peculiarly
competent
for
an
administrative
tribunal
with
the
icc.
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
it
was
not
such
a
question
and
said
for
that
reason,
kansas
city
suddenly
doesn't
apply.
our
--
our
position
simply
is
that
with
--
with
all
due
deference
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
icc
itself
has
in
at
least
five
cases
since
world
war
ii
said
that
this
is
a
reasonableness
question
and
as
for
that
reason
refused
to
apply
the
domestic
rate.
mr.
morton
hollander
may
it
please
the
court.
the
respondents
in
the
napalm
gel
case
and
by
incorporation
by
reference,
the
respondents
in
number
19
have
argued
that
there
are
outstanding
a
number
of
decisions
of
this
court
holding
that
the
two-year
limitation
period
prescribed
by
section
16
(3)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
is
jurisdictional
in
a
sense
that
it
sets
an
outside
boundary
on
the
power
of
the
commission
to
entertain
proceedings
filed
with
--
after
the
expiration
of
the
two-year
period.
i
believe
that
that
was
the
--
the
question
mr.
justice
harlan
was
interested
in.
now,
we
--
we
recognized
the
--
the
existence
of
these
series
of
decisions
characterized
by
the
respondents
as
an
unbroken
line
of
decision.
we
feel
though
that
they
are
besides
the
point
here.
all
of
those
decisions
to
the
extent
that
they
involved
proceedings
by
shippers
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
are
proceedings
initiated
independently
as
a
matter
of
first
resort
by
the
shipper
against
the
carrier
before
the
commission
and
none
of
those
cases
cited
is
establishing
these
jurisdictional
limits
on
the
interstate
commerce
commission
deal
with
the
power
of
the
court
as
an
incident
of
a
proceeding
timely
filed
before
it
to
refer
to
the
commission.
i
repeat
as
an
incident
of
the
power
of
the
court
hearing
the
case
to
refer
to
the
commission
a
proceeding
notwithstanding
the
lapse
of
the
two-year
period.
for
that
reason,
we
believe
that
--
that
line
of
jurisdictional
cases
by
itself,
that
reason
alone,
requires
that
those
decisions
on
the
jurisdictional
point
would
be
viewed
as
not
--
not
being
in
point.
now,
their
jurisdictional
argument
or
the
argument
that
these
cases
set
a
jurisdictional
limit
and
the
commissions
thereby
deprived
the
power
and
can't
take
the
case
also
ignores
the
fact
and
this
is
recognized
by
respondents
in
another
face
of
their
argument.
it
--
it
ignores
the
fact
that
the
government
is
because
it
is
the
government
because
it
is
the
sovereign.
it
is
entitled
to
a
special
immunity
from
statute
of
limitations
provisions.
so
that
even
if
it
were
to
be
assumed
as
respondents
necessarily
contend
that
the
reach
of
section
16
(3)
goes
far
beyond
its
language
and
extends
not
only
to
independent
reparation
proceedings
but
also
to
proceedings
referred
to
the
commission
as
an
incident
of
a
timely
filed
suit
in
court.
and
even
if
that
assumption
were
indulged
in,
the
respondents
cannot
possibly
explain
away
the
fact
that
the
united
states
traditionally
has
been
held
to
be
immune
from
such
a
statute
of
limitations
provisions.
now,
the
only
time
--
the
only
time
the
united
states
may
be
subjected
to
a
limitation
defense,
the
only
time
such
a
defense
may
be
ruled
to
apply
to
the
united
states,
and
this
court
has
consistently
held,
is
in
a
situation
where
congress
has
explicitly
manifested
an
intent
to
subject
the
united
states
to
that
particular
statute
of
limitations.
in
other
words,
if
in
section
16
(3)
(b),
there
were
some
explicit
manifestation
and
the
only
way
that
manifestation
could
possibly
be
expressed
would
be
by
saying
that
independent
reparation
proceedings
filed
by
the
united
states
just
as
an
independent
reparation
proceedings
filed
by
any
other
shipper,
they
would
have
to
refer
explicitly
to
the
united
states
and
subject
the
united
states
to
the
bar
of
their
two-year
period.
that,
of
course,
was
not
done
here.
the
respondents
seem
to
us
to
take
a
very
inconsistent
position
because
they
recognize
on
the
one
hand
that
because
of
the
sovereign
--
this
traditional
sovereign
immunity
from
limitations,
the
united
states,
the
united
states
if
it
went
into
court
beyond
the
expiration
of
the
two-year
period,
if
it
went
into
court,
section
16
(3)
they
say
they
agree
would
be
no
bar.
here,
however,
they
insist
that
if
rather
than
going
to
the
court
directly,
they
are
hailed
into
court
and
try
to
get
before
the
commission
as
an
incident
of
a
timely
filed
judicial
proceeding,
they
somehow
reason
that
this
traditional
sovereign
immunity
from
limitations
is
thrown
out
of
the
window,
so
that
the
united
states
may
be
met
whether
he
joined
to
that,
you're
too
late
now
to
go
over
to
the
commission,
even
though
you
want
to
get
there
as
an
incident
to
a
timely
filed
judicial
proceeding.
now,
we
believe
on
either
one
of
those
two
grounds,
the
line
of
cases
holding
that
section
16
(3)
is
jurisdictional,
really
has
no
application
here.
first,
as
i've
pointed
out
those
cases
involved
independent
reparation
proceedings
not
those
referred
as
an
incident.
secondly,
it
gives
no
consideration
to
the
unique
position.
the
united
states
has
always
occupied
in
its
immunity,
special
immunity
from
limitation
defenses.
for
the
reasons
i've
tried
to
outline
and
the
reasons
we
advanced
in
the
earlier
case
and
those
in
our
brief,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
number
19
and
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
claims
in
number
18
to
be
reversed
with
instructions
in
both
cases
remanding
the
cases
to
the
lower
courts
in
order
to
afford
the
government,
the
petitioner
here,
a
full
opportunity
to
present
all
of
its
defenses.
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
i
think
the
court's
questions
are
fully
explored
all
of
the
issues
in
the
case.
i
have
nothing
further
to
add,
except
i
would
like
to
take
two
or
three
minutes,
your
honor,
to
show
why
the
stipulation
mr.
spicer
relies
on.
mr.
morton
hollander
the
--
the
stipulation
controlled
the
government,
it
is
true
to
the
extent
that
that
case
was
similar
to
this.
but
that
case
was
different
from
this
in
at
least
these
three
respects
and
it
was
because
of
these
differences
in
these
three
respects
that
we
found
it
necessary
to
further
litigate
the
second
series
of
chesapeake
&
ohio
cases.
the
first
time
the
--
the
first
case,
the
one
in
which
the
stipulation
is
supposedly
controlling,
the
first
case
did
not
involve
any
subsequent
exportation.
judge
parker's
opinion
in
the
first
case
seemed
to
place
a
great
deal
of
emphasis
on
that
fact
that
we
had
not,
on
the
record
shown,
that
there
was
any
subsequent
exportation.
in
the
second
case,
we
were
ready
to
show
it.we
had
ample
evidence
of
subsequent
exportation.
that
was
a
major
difference
number
one.
in
the
first
case,
we
never
suggested
that
there
should
be
a
referral
of
the
reasonableness
question
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
judge
parker
in
the
first
case
thought
that
that
was
terribly
important
when
we
suggested
that
the
court
of
appeals,
the
first
time
should
--
and
that
the
district
court,
the
first
time
we
suggested
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
state
its
proceedings
and
referred
to
the
icc.
judge
parker
said,
“well,
you
didn't
ask
the
district
court
to.”
that
was
in
the
first
case.
in
the
second
case,
we
very
explicitly
asked
the
district
court
to
refer,
the
district
court
denied
the
motion.
it's
basic
difference
number
two.
finally,
in
the
first
case,
there
is
a
specific
factual
finding
by
the
district
court
that
there
was
a
voluntary
conversion
of
that
shipment
from
export
into
domestic
by
the
government,
the
district
court
relying
in
large
part
on
the
fact
that
we
never
showed
any
evidence
of
subsequent
exportation.
there
is
no
such
similar
finding
by
the
district
court
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
the
district
court
simply
viewed
it
as
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
we're
entitled
to
export
rate,
even
though
while
he
acknowledged
subsequent
exportation,
it
was
from
a
port
other
than
the
original
concerned
port.
