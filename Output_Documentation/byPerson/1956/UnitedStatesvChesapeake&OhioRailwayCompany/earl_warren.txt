mr.
hollander.
chief
justice
earl

in
connection
with
the
--
in
connection
with
the
war
also?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hollander.
chief
justice

mr.
spicer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
something
had
happened
that
they
couldn't
get
out
of
the
--
out
of
the
port
there
at
norfolk
and
--
and
they
had
to
be
--
the
material
had
to
be
shipped
up
to
baltimore
and
eventually
it
went
out
of
baltimore,
would
that
have
destroyed
the
rate,
do
you
think?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
suppose
it
have
--
it
have
to
have
applications
just
in
norfolk
and
something
occurred
there
and
they
couldn't
get
out
of
the
--
of
that
port
and
they
moved
--
moved
the
things
by
rail
again
up
to
baltimore
and
then
shipped
them
overseas
in
accordance
with
their
previous
intentions.
do
you
think
that
would
--
should
deprived
them
of
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
you
think
the
government
wanted
to
--
to
abandon
this
project
and
--
or
do
you
think
that
it
wanted
to
ship
these
goods
clear
across
the
continent
to
california
again
and
--
and
then
send
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
they
have
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they
did
go
to
the
pacific?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
they
had
to
pay
two
rates
across
the
continent
to
get
it,
didn't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
had
come
here
to
--
come
here
to
atlantic
coast
and
then
pay
that
and
they
are
taken
back
again
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
order
to
accomplish
the
same
purpose?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
noticed
that
one
of
these
shipments
is
made
on
december
10th
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
1941,
three
days
after
pearl
harbor
and
the
other
one
was
made
on
january
31st,
1942.
there
were
--
there
were
a
lot
of
things
going
out
in
the
pacific
besides
the
fall
of
rangoon
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
would
bear
that
that
might
influence
the
government
in
delaying
somewhat
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
transportation
of
these
things
and
you
got
to
blame
the
government
for
any
--
any
delay
that
was
occasioned
by
conditions
out
in
the
pacific
immediately
after
--
after
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
pearl
harbor.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
you
said
that
the
breach
was
made
when
they
took
them
up
to
new
jersey.
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
that
the
reason
that
the
government
gave
them
a
right
to
offset
on
these
charges
that
were
made
so
that
you
could
get
paid
immediately
and
those
things
could
take
due
course?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
was
done
at
the
request
of
the
railroads,
wasn't
it,
so
they
could
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
paid
immediately.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
as
mr.
hollander
said,
the
railroads
represent
it
to
--
to
congress.
well
--
we'll
let
the
audit
go
until
--
whenever
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
government
gets
around
to
it,
you
can
make
the
deductions
there
and
pay
it,
but
we
want
our
money
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
now
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
you
wouldn't
expect
under
those
circumstances,
would
you,
that
they
would
challenge
the
payment
right
at
that
moment.
we're
in
a
war
and
a
desperate
one
and
--
and
all
kinds
of
things
were
happening
out
in
the
ocean
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
many
and
many
shipment
couldn't
be
made
on
time
and
perhaps
had
to
be
routed
to
other
places
before
they
could
be
done.
do
you
think
the
government
should
be
penalized
for
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
by
our
own
railroads?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
they
did
--
but
they
didn't.
they
sent
them
overseas.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
did
this
cost
the
railroad
any
more
money?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
what's
the
burden?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
i
think
if
they
had
been,
you'd
have
--
might
have
an
entirely
different
case
here
and
maybe
it
wouldn't
be
here
at
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you,
mr.
spicer.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
hollander?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
