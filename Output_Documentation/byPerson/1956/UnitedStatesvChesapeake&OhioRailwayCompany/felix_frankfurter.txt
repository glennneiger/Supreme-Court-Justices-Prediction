how

does
the
government
quarrel
the
--
do
you
happen
to
know
how
often
the
government
contradict
the
applicability
of
particular
classifications.
the
government
is
big
shipper,
but
this
question
isn't
around
on
every
shipments.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
the
exceptional
case,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
bills.
i'm
talking
about
challenges
with
tariff.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
it
gets
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
with
thousands
and
thousands
of
bills
on
a
particular
commodity,
but
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
tariff
doesn't
cover,
was
it
the
same
as
everything?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
doesn't
touch
our
problem,
namely,
whether
you're
going
to
transfer
tariff
making
as
it
were
and
tariff
determination
to
the
gao
office.
justice

as
they
went
up
the
bar
until

until
there
is
conflict,
then
you
can
say
you
didn't
have
to
do
it.
justice

and
there
--
this
is
the
--
the
fourth
circuit
question
on
u.s.
against
chesapeake
&
ohio
and
distinguish
the
kansas
city
case.
are
you
familiar
with
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
might
care
to
say,
there
is
something
whether
you
think
they
were
wrong
and
take
the
position
that
the
more
likely
the
chesapeake
&
ohio
stated
prior
to
the
rule
15
as
against
a
very
different
result
that
it
did
make
a
reference
to
whether
(inaudible)
the
statute,
the
case
it
had
been
until
the

justice

certainly.
