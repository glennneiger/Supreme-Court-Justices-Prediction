mr.
meade
t.
spicer,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
with
reference
to
the
question
just
discussed
by
mr.
hollander,
i
do
like
to
call
attention
to
the
brief
filed
in
number
18,
page
29,
we
incorporated
by
reference
the
argument
there
on
this
particular
point.
and
on
page
29,
the
--
as
quoted
from
the
commission
case
itself,
in
fact
in
80
i.c.c.
in
which
it
went
into
the
reasons
for
its
conclusion
that
it
could
not
pass
on
a
claim
that
was
filed
after
two
years.
and
it
said,
“it
is
fundamental
that
we
act
only
under
the
jurisdiction
conferred
upon
us
by
congress.
it
is
the
status
of
the
tribunal
rather
than
the
status
of
the
litigant.”
in
other
words,
that
that
point
is
relied
upon
here
by
the
respondent.
the
power
--
in
other
words,
the
statute
created
the
right
and
also
created
the
remedy.
certainly,
situation
is
not
unusual
to
the
law,
one
that
is
common
i
believe
among
the
death
statutes
in
--
throughout
the
united
states,
in
the
state
statutes
as
well
as
on
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
statute
that
the
--
where
the
right
goes
with
the
remedy
when
it's
destroyed.
now,
i
would
like
to
ask
the
court
to
look
at
page
21
of
the
record
at
a
stipulation
of
counsel
with
this
case.
i
do
not
think
that
this
case,
there's
anything
to
decide
in
this
case
that
hasn't
already
been
decided
in
the
case
12,
and
like
68.
before
this
case
was
tried,
there
were
a
number
of
cases
pending
in
the
district
court
in
which
the
questions
of
frustrated
traffic
were
involved.
a
stipulation
of
counsel
was
entered
into
in
which
it
was
agreed
and
signed
--
signed
stipulation
on
page
21,
that
the
final
judgment
in
case
12,
number
68
should
govern
the
disposition
of
claims
involved
in
this
action
to
the
extent
that
it
is
applicable.
now,
that
copy
--
that
stipulation
was
filed
in
this
case.
that
was
entered
into
--
back
in
1953.
12,
68
was
a
test
case
which
was
litigated
through
the
district
court
and
through
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
a
year
ahead
of
this
case
and
that
is
the
case
that
is
referred
to
in
the
--
my
opinion
of
court
of
appeals
to
say
--
in
which
they
said,
it
seems
to
us
that
this
case
has
been
fully
decided
and
that
we
might
well
add
nothing
more.
in
other
words,
those
--
that
--
the
shipments
involved
in
this
case
arose
at
the
same
time
that
the
shipments
involved
in
that
case.
the
parties
were
the
same,
the
destinations
were
the
same,
the
starting
points
were
the
same,
pontiac,
michigan,
newport
news,
goods
intended
eventually
to
go
to
china
by
the
port
of
rangoon.
the
only
difference,
the
only
factual
difference
there
was
that
the
government
in
that
case
did
not
attempt
to
show
anything
after
the
goods
got
to
newport
news.
they
just
closed
that
and
said
that
we
weren't
able
to
carry
out
our
plans
because
of
all
developments
and
that
that
was
entered
here.
in
this
case,
they
did
go
to
the
extent
of
showing
that
a
year-and-a-half
later
after
the
goods
had
been
unloaded
and
stayed
at
newport
news
for
three
months
as
it
did
in
the
other
case,
they
were
reconsigned
back
to
storage
points
in
the
country,
government
storage
points.
they
stayed
in
storage
points
and
went
to
two-storage
points
stayed
for
a
year,
and
were
eventually
exported
not
to
china
but
to
india
not
by
newport
news
but
by
wilmington,
california.
now
quite
obviously,
say
that
--
that
was
not
a
compliance
as
we
see
it
with
the
tariff
and
we
have
filed
here
original
transcript
of
a
copy
of
a
portions
of
the
tariff
that
seemed
to
be
applicable.
that
was
in
--
in
the
first
case.
they
--
mr.
meade
t.
spicer,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
would
have
printed
--
present
a
fairly
close
question.
i
think
possibly,
they
would
have
been
entitled
to
it
because
of
this
particular
tariff
allowed
other
eastern
ports,
allowed
exportation
to
be
made
through
other
eastern
ports.
it
had
no
application
to
anything,
specific
ports
at
all.
mr.
meade
t.
spicer,
jr.
well,
i
--
possibly
not
if
the
question
of
reasonableness
i
think
they
have
construction,
that
should
be
construction.
mr.
meade
t.
spicer,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
was
a
--
there
were
sent
to
a
storage
cellar.
mr.
meade
t.
spicer,
jr.
and
repacked
and
we
crated
apparently.
and
then,
of
course,
they
had
to
go
to
pacific
and
they
were
--
suddenly
where
we
crate
it
and
stayed
--
stayed
there.
mr.
meade
t.
spicer,
jr.
a
year
and
a
half
later.
mr.
meade
t.
spicer,
jr.
now,
we
think
that's
a
separate
movement.
there
were
two
intervening,
at
least
two
--
three
intervening
domestic
movements
on
which
they
paid
freight
charges.
mr.
meade
t.
spicer,
jr.
and
on
which
they
ultimately
got
an
export
rate
according
to
allegations
through
wilmington
railroads
in
california.
in
other
words,
they
did
get
an
export
--
export
rate.
well,
that
is,
they
don't
deny
that
they
didn't
get
export
rate.
well,
it
went
out
of
wilmington,
north
--
california.
mr.
meade
t.
spicer,
jr.
well,
they
had
some
--
mr.
meade
t.
spicer,
jr.
well,
we
--
mr.
meade
t.
spicer,
jr.
we
said
--
we
said
that
is
another
movement.
that's
another
freight
movement.
how
long
will
this
thing
going
to
last?
no,
doubt,
i
think
they
keep
on
doing
that
indefinitely.
but
the
statute,
this
tariff,
by
exportation
from
newport
news.
and
that
was
the
way
it
was
submitted
to
the
initial
agent
in
pontiac,
michigan
through
newport
news.
now,
of
course,
this
tariff
wasn't
put
into
effect
just
for
military
shipments.
it
was
started
in
peace
times.
it's
a
--
it's
a
traffic
matter.
it's
a
competitive
matter.
norfolk
is
not
as
big
a
port
as
new
york
and
boston
and
that's
--
that's
the
--
that's
the
background
of
--
for
having
it.
and
when
it
got
to
newport
news
and
it
was
--
we
didn't
know
anything
about
it
being
going
across.
they
--
we
--
we
--
bills
for
the
freight
charges
were
assessed
as
soon
as
it
went
to
the
first
other
point,
which
was
bloomfield,
new
jersey.
now,
in
this
case,
as
soon
as
there
was
--
they
shipped
to
bloomfield,
new
jersey,
bills
were
rendered
by
the
cno.
they
not
--
they
all
--
they
--
they
got
--
collected
a
domestic
rate
from
newport
news
back
to
bloomfield.
but
in
--
before
doing
that
or
when
doing
that,
they
presented
the
bill
on
the
basis
of
a
domestic
rate
movement
from
pontiac
to
newport
news.
they
were
paid
properly
and
that's
the
way
this
thing
remains
insofar
as
the
government
is
concerned.
i
mention
that
because
of
the
situation
in
other
cases
but
they
were
paid
properly
and
it
was
four
years
later
before
the
cno
had
any
knowledge
that
there
was
any
question
about
that
being
the
proper
rate
to
pay.
the
cno
had
no
knowledge
of
any
subsequent
transporting,
transferring
to
india
across
--
across
the
country.
it
had
--
it
didn't
have
any
bill
presented
to
it
for
--
to
revise
or
anything
like
that,
but
four
years
later.
so
that
this
claim,
if
there
was
a
claim
for
reasonableness,
died
or
--
or
attacked
on
the
reasonableness
died
while
the
matter
was
in
the
hands
of
the
government.cno
had
no
status
before
the
commission.
now,
all
that
was
gone
until
we
say
about
the
other
case,
we
think
it
--
that
by
virtue
of
this
stipulation
of
counsel
in
the
case
that
that
judgment
is
--
is
binding
in
this
case
that
there's
nothing
legally
additional
that
make
any
difference.
the
difference
was
simply
that
--
and
the
fact
that
i
believe
in
--
in
the
case
below,
the
first
case,
they
did
not
actually
apply
for
a
hearing
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
they
did
question.
they
bring
up
the
question
of
reasonableness.
now,
we
say
that
there
isn't
any
question
of
reasonableness
involved
here
and
we
think
it's
been
a
while
substantiated
because
the
same
thing
was
brought
up
in
both
cases,
in
the
first
cases.
the
district
court
said,
“well,
isn't
that
a
question
of
reasonableness
here?
all
you're
contesting
is
which
rate
applies.”
and
he
said,
“i
--
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
is
confident
under
these
circumstances
to
say
whether
a
though
rate
applies
or
vested.”
but
he
found
that
was
a
voluntary
conversion
in
that
first
case
and
he
specifically
set
out
in
the
opinion
of
the
court.
there
was
a
change
of
intention
and
that
--
that
was
required.
he
thought
it
was
a
domestic
movement.
and
that
was
--
that
was
a
basis
of
the
opinion.
he
said
it
was
a
voluntary
--
government
voluntarily
converted
what
had
started
out
as
an
export
shipment
into
a
domestic
shipment.
there
is
no
reason
why
it
should
not
pay
the
domestic
rate.
now,
in
the
course,
the
testimony
wasn't
very
long
here
but
is
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
when
the
--
sometimes
before
the
trial,
question
was
raised
as
to
what
--
what
was
--
what
we're
trying
to
do
with
the
goods
in
between
and
it
was
stated
by
a
witness
in
general
accounting
office
that
they
were
trying
to
decide
what
they're
going
to
do
with
it.
that
was
all
that
--
they
knew
it
at
the
time
they
--
they
moved
it
back
to
bloomfield,
new
jersey
except
they
won't
put
some
additional
freighting
order.
now,
we
submit
that
they
say
there
--
there
is
no
question
of
reasonableness
except
in
a
very
superficial
way
involved.
there
--
the
shipments
did
not
stop
until
after
the
attack
of
pearl
harbor,
december
the
10th
through
january.
they
are
--
nothing
was
shown
to
have
happened
since
then
except
the
fall
of
rangoon
which
happened
about
six
weeks
after
they
got
there.
and,
of
course,
rangoon
was
not
the
place,
it
has
ultimate
destination.
rangoon
was
simply
the
port
that
they
were
scheduled
to
go
out
from.
now,
we
submit
that
it
is
not
fair
to
place
on
the
railroad
with
the
knowledge
that
the
government
had
when
these
shipments
moved
from
pontiac.war
had
begun
at
that
time.
and
that
this
is
a
--
not
a
risk
that
would
--
should
be
fall
upon
the
railroad
to
make
a
revision
of
its
records
or
rates.
the
carrier
was
--
the
government
knew
that
when
a
shipper
was
submitted
at
pontiac,
michigan
that
the
rates
and
tax
have
effected
that
time
ago.
and
to
see
that
the
initial
carrier,
they
had
to
take
them
under
those
tariffs
which
remained
in
effect.
that
is
so
plain
and
it
seems
to
us
and
it
seemed
to
the
district
judge,
there's
no
question
here.
nobody
has
attacked,
presented
any
attack
on
these
rates
of
reasonableness
of
its
other
rates
by
any
proper
proceedings
and
there's
nothing
to
do
but
to
enforce
them.
and
they
came
back
and
say,
that
was
in
--
held
in
the
first
case.
and
that
was
--
it
was
conceived
by
this
stipulation
that
the
further
second
case
should
be
governed
by
it.
no
--
no
application
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
was
filed
closing
the
first
case.
and
they
came
back
with
exactly
the
same
position
and
just
said,
“well,
it's
unreasonable.”
and
the
court
tried
to
bring
--
for
--
for
what
circumstances
make
it
unreasonable.
and
the
only
thing
they
could
say,
“well,
rangoon
fell,
war
was
on
before
we
began
and
that's
all.”
now,
that
kind
of
a
situation
in
relation
to
the
great
law
and
element
of
the
case
simply
calls
for
a
simple
decision
of
a
court.
it
didn't
require
any
battery
of
tariff
experts,
economic
experts,
anything
of
that
kind.
it
was
a
--
something
that's
similar
to
what
a
federal
judge
has
to
decide
everyday.
mr.
meade
t.
spicer,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
the
--
i
--
i
think
that
the
--
the
position
was
when
--
when
the
first
case
was
over,
we
appeared
to
ask
for
judgment
in
this
case
and
the
government
said,
“no,
this
--
this
stipulation
takes
care
of
it
while
the
court
says
that
if
there's
some
other
questions
involved,
why,
it
shall
not
be
controlling.
but
so
far
as
the
first
raise
rule,
they
will
be
controlling.
and
they
said,
“well,
we
got
some
additional
circumstances
here.”
and
they
--
were
afterwards
exported
at
some
remote
time.
of
course,
we
didn't
agree
that
that
was
true,
but
we
tried
to
facilitate
a
method
by
which
the
court
might
provisionally
hear
that
question.
the
court
--
there
wasn't
any
witness
there
from
the
general
accounting
office
at
all
to
explain
anything.
they
simply
submitted
a
sheet
--
worksheets.
now,
what
there's
one
--
one
ultimate,
sir,
printed
in
the
record,
just
one
sheet,
but
they're
about
25
sheets
altogether
and
that's
the
transcript
right
back.
there
wasn't
any
witness
there
to
explain
anything
about
them.
and
we
just
had
to
take
them
as
it
were,
and
i
guess
as
the
best
contention
of
through
movement
and
unreasonable
rate
should
be
sustained
on
that
basis.
mr.
meade
t.
spicer,
jr.
yes.
mr.
meade
t.
spicer,
jr.
that's
--
that's
certainly
--
mr.
meade
t.
spicer,
jr.
well,
that
is
certainly
--
mr.
meade
t.
spicer,
jr.
well
--
mr.
meade
t.
spicer,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
our
--
our
position
we
don't
question
the
delay,
if
they
had
stayed
at
newport
news
and
going
on
from
newport
news,
i
suppose
they
could
have
stayed
rather
indefinitely
to
deal
with
the
development
issues.
mr.
meade
t.
spicer,
jr.
well,
that's
what
the
court
said
that
that
was
a
voluntary
thing
that
he
did
and
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
indication
from
any
dealings
with
the
carrier
that
they
were
ever
going
to
be
shipped
anywhere
over
the
country
after
that
time.
in
other
words,
there
wouldn't
be
any
mark
put
on
freight
bills
or
any
notice
given
to
carrier
or
anything.
as
far
as
the
cno
knew
that
was
the
end
of
the
transaction.
and
they
only
knew
different
four
years
later
when
the
general
accounting
office
said
we
have
deducted
these
amounts.
now,
that
--
that
was
--
mr.
meade
t.
spicer,
jr.
well,
that's
a
part
of
the
statute,
same
statute,
yes,
sir.
mr.
meade
t.
spicer,
jr.
that's
certainly
true.
mr.
meade
t.
spicer,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
meade
t.
spicer,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
part
of
it
was
at
the
request
of
the
railroads
but
it
wasn't
done
at
the
same
time.
in
other
words,
the
railroads
were
interested
in
getting
from
or
more
from
the
payment
than
they
had
gotten
by
reason
of
things
that
hadn't
been
audited.
mr.
meade
t.
spicer,
jr.
yes.
mr.
meade
t.
spicer,
jr.
yes.
mr.
meade
t.
spicer,
jr.
that's
--
that's
entirely
true.
mr.
meade
t.
spicer,
jr.
well
--
mr.
meade
t.
spicer,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
should
have
stated
--
mr.
meade
t.
spicer,
jr.
i
--
i
think
it
should
have
stated.
you
could
use
all.
i
have
to
conceive
that
there
may
have
been
strategic
developments
that
demanded
that
other
things
be
done
with
it.
well,
if
that
was
true,
that
was
a
military
risk.
that
wasn't
a
carrier
risk.
the
carrier
had
a
risk
that
was
set
forth
in
the
tariffs
and
in
the
bill
of
lading.
and
that
was
what
it
is.
when
--
when
they
were
shipped
after
--
after
the
war
begun
and
all
of
these
were
that
--
that
wasn't
a
risk
that
was
put
on
the
carrier
and
it
was
--
no
military
risk.
and
i
say
that
the
expense
here
may
have
been
very
small
compared
to
what
the
importance
--
military
for
having
these
goods
somewhere
else.
they
might
have
sent
them
back
to
entirely
into
the
continent
and
they
may
--
may
have
used
them
for
self-defense,
but
that
wouldn't
affect
the
--
mr.
meade
t.
spicer,
jr.
they
sent
them
overseas
after
two
independent,
two
or
three
independent
movements
indicating
that
they
probably
decided
what
to
do
then,
what
they're
going
to
--
but
it
just
--
it
just
--
just
happens
that
they
ultimately
sell
them
to
the
same
continent
not
to
the
same
country,
but
to
the
same
continent
that
they
were
suppose
to
go
and
start
there.
now,
we
say
that
that's
an
unwarranted
burden
upon
the
railroads
or
i
should
say
something
had
been
done
but
that
was
--
we
weren't
--
not
--
not
until
four
years
later.
mr.
meade
t.
spicer,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
that
it
did,
but
it's
a
--
mr.
meade
t.
spicer,
jr.
well,
i
--
we
were
entitled
to
it
on
the
situation
that
existed
for
a
year
afterwards
and
we
have
until
four
years
afterwards.
and
we
had
no
way
of
knowing
that
we
would
be
called
upon
to
pay
anything
more.
i
think
that's
right
along
a
period
of
time
for
something
to
be
--
come
back
on
--
on
you
is
--
without
any
notice.
but
we
know
whether
they
were
had
--
had
been
put
and
sent
somewhere
else
in
the
country.
they
are
used
for
national
guard
or
inside
the
country
and
otherwise,
we
had
no
way
of
--
mr.
meade
t.
spicer,
jr.
well,
we
didn't
think
we
would
ever
be
here
on
these
shipments
after
so
did
--
for
--
for
months.
now,
i
think
that
the
fact,
this
first
point
we
made
in
our
brief,
that
the
fact
that
two
courts,
the
lower
court
and
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
found
in
both
cases
that
there
had
been
a
voluntary
conversion
of
these
goods
back
into
domestic
shipments
that
that
should
justify
affirmance
of
the
opinion.
now,
i
realize
that's
not
a
mandatory
rule
by
anyway,
but
i
think
it's
a
reasonable
rule
and
in
view
of
the
stipulation
in
this
case,
which
have
all
the
elements,
i
have
never
seen
one
in
which
it
was
so
much
alike
and
just
the
different
shipments
and
what
--
as
far
the
time
and
the
places
and
the
parties
and
everything.
now,
i
don't
think
that
question
of
statute
of
limitations
was
involved
in
this
case.
the
--
the
brief,
government
brief
starts
off
in
this
court
by
saying
the
two
years
limitation
thing.
well,
that
statute
of
limitation
was
not
mentioned
in
the
trial
court.
it
wasn't
mentioned
in
the
trial
court
in
the
preceding
case.
and
we
submit
that
the
briefs
had
said
nothing
about
them
in
--
in
the
court
of
appeals
case.
and
there's
only
an
effort
on
--
apparently
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
get
this
case
into
the
move
that
the
other
case
was
that
their
question
was
presented.
we
don't
think
it
has
anything
to
do
with
the
case.
we
adopted
colonel
weiner's
argument
on
the
point,
but
the
jurisdictional
power
lacking
in
the
court
of
claims.
but
the
record
just
doesn't
say
anything
about
it.
there's
no
testimony.
there's
no
position
taken
by
a
counsel
and
the
first
thing
we
heard
of
it
was
in
the
application
for
certiorari
here.
mr.
meade
t.
spicer,
jr.
the
court
of
appeals
as
--
in
its
opinion
in
the
last
case
said
in
this
case,
said
that
the
case
is
just
like
--
is
like
the
one
before
and
nothing
further
need
--
need
to
be
said.
the
case,
we
think,
is
clearly
governed
by
our
own
former
decision
and
nothing
may
be
added
--
nothing
need
to
be
added
to
what
was
said
there.
that
it
went
on
to
say
in
answer
to
the
government's
contention
that
this
is
a
great
hardship
on
us,
for
two-year
limitation
and
you're
assuming
on
a
six-year
limitation
that
this
is
hardship,
its
unfair
and
uneven
and
referred
to
the
kansas
city
southern
case
in
which
the
court
said
there
was
no
such
administrative
questions
involved
in
--
in
this
case
as
it
was
in
that
case
which
involved
element
of
charges
at
--
at
a
port
where
there
was
no
--
where
there
was
a
tariff,
it
provided
that
it
should
be
absorbed
by
the
carrier,
but
where
the
shipper
didn't
elect
to
take
them
that
way,
but
went
out
and
got
some
of
his
own,
took
the
same
elevator
company,
hired
it
privately
and
then
claimed
afterwards
that
he
ought
to
have
the
allowance
for
it.
and
--
and
after
that,
the
court
has
--
it
went
on
to
say
more
or
less
to
placate
to
the
other
side
that
furthermore
it
would
not
have
been
a
reasonable
discretion
to
stay
proceedings
pending
action
by
the
commission
where
all
parties
before
the
court
were
barred
by
limitations
from
asking
for
such
action.
now,
the
government
grabbed
on
to
that
which
was
not
necessary
to
the
decision
at
all
because
the
court
had
previously
decided
the
case.
it's
not
necessary
to
say
anything
else.
the
government
grabbed
on
to
that
and
makes
it
the
first
point
in
his
brief
in
this
case.
mr.
meade
t.
spicer,
jr.
[laughs]
well,
i
think
it
was
too
late
in
this
case.
it
wasn't
presented
in
the
lower
court
in
any
sense.
it
wasn't
presented
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
any
sense.
so
it
just
wasn't
litigated
there.
and
i
--
as
i
understand
this
court
to
review
is
what
happened
in
--
in
the
trial
court,
as
long
as
the
case
was
affirmed.
the
decision
of
the
district
court
was
affirmed
by
the
district
--
court
of
appeals,
this
case
and
in
the
preceding
case
without
any
change
at
all.
and
we
--
it
was
submit
that
--
here,
the
question
here
is
what
happened
in
the
district
court.
and
here,
the
government
brief
starts
out
by
saying
something
about
the
statute
of
limitations
of
two-year,
which
--
well,
i
don't
think
the
trial
judge
would
recognize
the
case.
now,
we
submit
therefore
that
--
that
under
the
circumstances
that
--
and
the
findings,
specific
findings,
that
there
was
(inaudible)
conversion
back
into
a
--
from
an
interstate
movement
--
export
movement
into
a
domestic
movement
that
the
domestic
rates
was
properly
applied
and
that
judgment
should
therefore
be
affirmed.
the
reason
we're
putting
this
tariff
excerpt
in
was
that
it
did
not
appear
on
the
--
necessarily
in
the
trial
that
the
rate
applied
in
newport
news
but
it
did
supply
to
northern
but
the
tariff
shows
that
they
provide
in
both
places.
