suppose
they
had
never
been
exported
to
india,
would
that
make
any
difference?
justice
harold
burton
mr.
hollander,
even
though
you
do
succeed
in
your
point
that
the
time
has
not
expired
for
doing
this,
don't
you
still
have
to
show
that
this
is
the
kind
of
a
case
that
should
be
referred
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission?
this
isn't
the
interpretation
of
a
tariff.
it's
just
a
difference
between
domestic
and
--
and
export,
isn't
it?
justice
harold
burton
everybody
--
justice
harold
burton
including
the
railroad
agrees
that
the
difference
between
domestic
and
--
justice
harold
burton
all
right.
