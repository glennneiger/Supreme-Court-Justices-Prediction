justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
is
your
factual
situation
changed
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
on
the
--
on
the
facts
before
1945,
did
you
qualify
for
exemption
under
the
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
under
the
statute
then,
you
did
have
a
support
of
--
of
judicial
decisions
that
you
are
entitled
to
statutory
exemption.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what
i'm
having
difficulty
is
i
don't
understand
if
you
were
entitled
of
the
exemption
under
the
statute
before
1945,
why
you
now
tell
us
that
you
acknowledge
that
you're
not
entitled
to
it
after
1945?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now
to
draw
an
inference
on
that
maybe
you're
wrong
all
along
before
1945
(voice
overlap)
in
your
title
of
defense.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
might
be
more
worried
about
losing
on
the
first.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
don't
bother
answering
that
--
[laughter]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
the
tax
very
different
in
allowing
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
with
that
one
year,
or
two
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
there
isn't
any
prospect
as
a
practical
matter
that
the
government
will
go
back
of
1943?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
could
that
be
rescinded
tomorrow
and
then
the
government
go
back?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
can't
--
you
can't
say
--
you
can't
say
that
that's
conclusive
against
the
commissioner
is
going
back
if
the
commissioner
wants
to
resend
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
meanwhile
will
this
taxpayer
have
the
advantage
after
1954
of
the
compromise
that
you
just
mentioned?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
the
first
exception
to
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
about
outside
the
automobile
club
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
you
said
that
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
standard
procedure
was
not
to
apply
to
these
changes.
