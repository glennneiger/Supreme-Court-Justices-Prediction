justice
hugo
l.
black
where
--
where
is
the
power
given
the
commissioner?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
grant
exemptions
and
keep
them
in
exempt
for
five
or
six
years
on
the
basis
of
that
an
exemption
under
the
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
promulgate
a
new
rule
and
make
it
effective
in
the
future.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
--
you
disturb
me
by
your
concession.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
why
do
you
say
that
then
that
he
could
grant
exemptions?
it
doesn't
stay
in
effect
for
a
number
of
years
and
then
decides
he
doesn't
want
to
grant
exemptions
and
cut
them
off
for
the
future,
that
the
law
offers
or
delegate
such
a
power
to
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
must
decide
that
but
does
that
prevent
binding
on
the
court
if
it
comes
to
the
court?
in
other
words,
does
the
statute
fix
the
exemptions
or
does
the
commissioner
fix
the
exemption?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
gather
from
you
that
the
commissioner
determines
the
exemptions
under
the
tax
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
was
wrong
under
the
statute
in
granting
the
exemption,
why
couldn't
he
change
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
suppose
the
tax
laws
were
fixed
by
the
statute.
i
didn't
know
that
the
exemption
and
so
forth
is
determined
by
the
tax
commissioner.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
they're
--
if
they're
valid
under
the
statute,
that's
a
good
interpretation
as
we
take
it.
it
has
great
weight
in
saying
whether
that
statute
doesn't
mean
to.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
not
the
issue
i
thought
it
was.[laughter]
maybe
it
is.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
it
make
any
difference
so
far
as
the
law
is
concerned
(inaudible)
whether
you
didn't
know?
justice
hugo
l.
black
only
the
little
ones,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
only
a
little
one.[laughter]
