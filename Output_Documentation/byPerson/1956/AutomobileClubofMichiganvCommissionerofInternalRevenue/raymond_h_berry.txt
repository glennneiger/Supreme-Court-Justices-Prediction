mr.
raymond
h.
berry
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
alvord
has
brought
briefly
on
some
of
the
functions
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
i
would
like
to
elaborate
on
them
because
from
the
standpoint
of
the
accounting,
the
facts
involved
in
this
case
would
appear
to
be
quite
important.
bear
in
mind
please
the
automobile
club
of
michigan
has
carried
on
an
accounting
system
dating
back
to
1934,
a
consistent
system
of
accounting
on
the
accrued
basis
in
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
our
system
of
accounting
has
been
carried
on
uninterruptedly
from
june
30th,
1924
from
mr.
sasser
the
chief
accounting
officer
of
the
club
so
testified.
now
our
dues
as
to
the
corporation,
existing
under
our
laws
as
a
membership
corporation.
our
dues
during
this
period
of
time
were
$10
a
year.
except
in
october
of
1946,
that
was
increased
to
$12.
however,
i
shall
use
$10
(inaudible).
the
club
--
those
dues
are
paid
daily.
that
is
a
man
may
join
on
the
6th
day
of
march
1957
for
his
$10.
his
membership
continues
for
12
months
until
march
5th,
1958
and
he
has
built
a
(inaudible).
now
those
dues
are
to
carry
on
the
functions
of
the
club
which
we
agree
to
furnish
him
for
12
months
time.
among
those
are
road
service,
which
includes
towing
of
automobiles,
factory
service,
fixing
cars,
and
so
forth.
now
we
have
absolutely
no
way
of
estimating
based
on
the
years
of
experience
what
that
cost
runs
one
year
from
another.
now
we
take
this
man's
$10.
we
put
that
into
a
separate
fund
known
as
unearned
membership
dues.
once
a
month,
we
take
out
of
that
fund
one-twelfth.
now,
i
hope
i'm
not
misunderstood.
this
fund
is
not
a
separate
bank
account.
it
is
a
separate
account
in
our
books
and
ledgers.
we
do
not
regard
that
money
as
earned.
up
to
that
point,
the
time
this
man
pays
his
$10,
we
have
not
earned
one
penny.
our
--
what
we
agreed
to
give
him
or
serve
him
is
all
in
the
future.
let's
take
a
case
where
a
man
may
join
the
club,
we'll
say
the
first
of
october.
we
take
into
income,
three
clubs
of
that
$10,
the
balance
for
the
--
the
three
remaining
fund
--
months
of
the
balance
of
that
year.
by
theway,
we
are
on
in
a
full
basis
and
our
fiscal
year
is
december
31st.
we
take
that
money
into
income
of
the
three
clubs,
one
club
each
month.
so
there's
nine
months
remaining
of
those
twelve
for
which
we
have
agreed
to
furnish
him
certain
of
the
services,
the
services
which
briefly
enumerate.
now
we
then
take
out
of
that
unearned
--
mr.
raymond
h.
berry
--
membership
account,
three
clubs
of
that
$10.
we
put
that
in
our
income
and
we
pay
a
tax
on
that
three
clubs.
mr.
raymond
h.
berry
the
government's
position
here
is
that
we
should
pay
a
tax
on
the
full
$10
in
the
year
in
which
proceeding.
and
right
there
is
the
issue
on
this
account.
now
we
have
conducted
this
business
since
1916.
we
believe
we
know
something
about
the
business
itself,
the
up
right
--
we
had
all
this
in
detroit
with
26
branches
throughout
the
state
of
michigan.
during
the
period
here
under
review
our
membership
increased
from
something
like
215
or
20,000
members
to
269
to
70,000.
today,
there's
a
great
(inaudible).
95%
of
our
income
of
our
receipts
are
from
these
dues.
the
balance
of
our
income
is
from
investments
and
miscellaneous
sources
not
too
important
here.
now
the
road
service,
our
emergency
service
and
the
things
that
we
agreed
to
give
that
member
when
he
joins,
in
fact
he
joins
in
order
to
obtain
those
services.
95%
or
--
the
largest
amount
of
that
income
goes
to
and
towards
the
payment
of
the
services
for
which
we
agreed
to
furnish
that
line.
whether
that
be
within
the
12
months
or
whether
that
be
within
the
next
--
i
mean
within
the
county
here
or
within
the
next
--
the
months
of
showing
in
the
following
act.
now
i
mentioned
we
cannot
determine
what
our
costs
are.
we
cannot
for
the
reason,
i
mean
our
--
setup
a
reserve
for
the
reason
that
if
we
have
a
very
tough
winter,
snow,
rain,
hail,
(inaudible)
and
so
forth,
various
road
conditions.
then
our
cost
go
up
appreciatively.
by
the
same
token,
if
we
have
a
very
hot
summer,
which
we
sometimes
have
in
michigan,
then
our
cost
by
the
same
token,
materially
increase
because
they
call
for
more
services.
in
summer,
they
will
call
for
road
information
and
maps
and
the
tour
laws.
in
the
winter,
we
furnish
those
also
for
which
of
course
we'll
make
no
charge.
we
have
not
been
able
to
adopt
any
system
of
accounting
that
will
meet
our
needs
any
better.
we
believe
it's
a
sensible
sound
system,
at
least
it
has
been
so
tried
and
we
believe
there's
no
improvement
of
it.
now
our
system
is
one
of
accounting
is
one
that
we
rely
upon
for
all
our
purposes.
we
rely
upon
it
for
our
state
tax
purposes,
our
accounting
purposes
to
the
state
of
michigan,
in
any
at
all
other
purposes
and
upon
the
basis
upon
which
we
have
filed
our
tax
returns
with
the
government.
to
change
that
system
which
the
government
has
done,
they
have
put
us
on
a
case
basis.
by
the
way,
the
government
does
not
dispute
the
fact
that
we
are
on
a
poor
basis
and
that
we
had
consistently
followed
our
method
of
accounting
throughout
all
these
years.
i
don't
believe
there's
any
dispute
as
to
our
--
that
--
how
we've
handled
it.
now
to
put
us
on
a
case
basis
and
i
submit,
your
honors,
that
if
95%
of
our
revenue
is
from
the
dues
and
the
government
says,
â€œwe
want
to
tax
those
dues
and
perceived,
they
then
have
shifted
our
basis
to
a
case
basis
from
an
accrue
basis.
to
me,
95%
is
almost
100%.
we
accrue
the
balance
anyhow.
mr.
raymond
h.
berry
no,
sir.
well
--
well
yes,
wait
a
minute.
we
--
we
raised
a
question
as
to
our
method
of
accounting.
we
claimed
that
our
method
of
accounting
--
mr.
raymond
h.
berry
yes,
sir.
we
--
we
claim
that
our
method
of
accounting,
mr.
justice
warren
is
that
should
be
use
--
the
method
we
follow
should
be
used
for
income
tax
purposes
for
1945
and
all
the
years
following.
today
we
make
out
our
returns
what
the
--
accept
through
on
that
basis.
mr.
raymond
h.
berry
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
burton.
now
we
must
--
well,
now,
let's
see
what
the
statute
requires
us
to
do.
section
41,
the
internal
revenue
code
provides,
it
sets
--
mr.
raymond
h.
berry
--
forth
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
raymond
h.
berry
well
--
mr.
raymond
h.
berry
well
i
think
i
could
explain
that,
mr.
justice
warren.
mr.
alvord
was
talking
about
two
other
points.
now
our
--
which
do
not
run
through
and
carry
this
side
of
1945,
the
statute
of
limitations
and
the
retroactive
revocation
of
our
exemption.
mr.
raymond
h.
berry
however,
our
accounting
carries
through
every
year.
if
we're
taxable
from
1945,
1943
on,
then
by
the
same
token,
our
accounting
method
determines
the
basis
of
our
tax.
so
our
accounting
method
differs
from
the
two
points
mr.
alvord.
because
our
accounting
must
be
consistent
every
year
and
we
are
taxable,
we
know
that
from
1945
forward.
so
we
must
have
a
system
that
will
determine
the
basis
or
furnish
the
basis
to
determine
our
tax.
though
our
accounting
therefore
is
very
important.
now
section
41
of
the
--
mr.
raymond
h.
berry
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
raymond
h.
berry
yes,
sir.
mr.
raymond
h.
berry
and
vice
versa
or
i
hope
we
went
on
all
of
them
--
on
both
of
them.
mr.
raymond
h.
berry
well,
no.
if
i
had
--
mr.
raymond
h.
berry
all
right,
sir.
now,
on
section
41
of
the
code,
the
internal
revenue
code
provides
to
submit
income
shall
be
--
and
i'm
going
to
indulge
of
just
reading
a
portion
of
it,
shall
be
computed
upon
the
basis
of
tax
presented
in
the
accounting
period
in
accordance
with
the
method
of
accounting
regular
employees
in
keeping
the
books
of
such
taxpayers.
but
if
those
such
methods
of
accounting
has
been
so
employed,
or
if
the
method
employed
does
not
fairly
reflect
the
income,
a
computation
shall
be
made
in
accordance
with
such
method
as
the
commissioner
may
determine.
now
that
is
just
where
we
are.
now,
my
time
is
up
and
i
--
it's
a
very
important
facts
of
material
and
this
is
very
important
because
the
lower
court
and
the
tax
court
have
put
us
on
a
so-called
claim
of
right
doctrine
which
we
claim
by
reason
or
by
our
systems
and
the
necessity
for
our
bookkeeping
deprives
us
of
force
and
such,
in
fact
to
continue
our
system
because
we
cannot
develop
and
device
any
other
system.
mr.
raymond
h.
berry
and
there
are
--
mr.
raymond
h.
berry
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
raymond
h.
berry
we
were
relying
upon
beacon
publishing
company
that
is
cited
in
our
brief
but
i
can
look
it
up.
mr.
raymond
h.
berry
we
believe
that
in
--
there
is
precedent
for
our
case.
in
the
beacon
case,
it's
on
the
newspaper
where
they
take
subscription
over
a
period
of
years,
from
one
to
five
years.
they
are
permitted
to
defer
their
income
just
the
same
as
we
are
asking
for
a
privilege
to
differ
here.
incidentally,
the
beacon
has
congressional
pool
in
the
repeal
of
sections
425
and
--
452
and
462,
in
the
committee
reports,
both
the
senate
of
finance
committee
and
the
house
ways
and
means
committee
and
then
a
letter
from
secretary
humphrey.
now
we
are
relying
on
the
beacon
case,
the
schuessler
case.
we
believe
that
they
support
our
position
and
our
accounting
position
and
in
our
method
of
treating
the
revenue
available
to
us.
mr.
raymond
h.
berry
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
raymond
h.
berry
yes,
sir.
mr.
raymond
h.
berry
yes,
sir.
i
might
say
this
quickly.
if
our
membership
dues
--
if
our
membership
and
our
dues,
state
status,
there
will
be
no
difference
in
tax
if
our
membership
were
to
decrease
or
our
income
were
to
decrease
from
dues,
our
method
would
produce
a
greater
amount
of
revenue
and
vice
versa.
