mr.
john
n.
stull
may
it
please
the
court.
of
the
two
questions
before
the
court
here,
i'd
like
to
start
off
with
the
ruling
question
and
then
later
come
back
to
the
accounting
question.
as
regard
to
this
ruling,
there
seems
to
be
some
intimation
here,
the
certain
lack
of
integrity
on
the
part
of
the
tax
collectors
in
a
so-called
retroactive
revocation
of
a
ruling.
and
taxpayers
are
asking
this
court
to
come
to
their
rescue.
i
think
it
is
pertinent
in
this
case
to
remember,
as
mr.
alvord
pointed
out,
that
they
have
conceded
on
this
oral
argument
before
the
tax
court
that
this
outset
is
not
exempt
after
1945.
this
to
us
means
that
it
never
was
exempt
under
the
statute.
therefore,
we
have
an
organization
which
since
1916
until
1943
did
not
bear
its
fair
share
of
the
tax
burden
which
congress
meant
to
place
upon
organizations
of
this
type.
and
now,
this
court
is
being
asked
to
help
it
to
escape
its
fair
share
taxes
for
two
additional
years,
1916
to
1943
apparently
wasn't
enough.
now
in
pointing
up
our
approach
to
this
case,
i
would
like
to
briefly
summarize
the
facts
of
this
case,
discuss
the
statute
under
which
the
commissioner
is
operating
and
finally
try
to
analyze
just
what
it
is
that
the
taxpayer
is
complaining
about
in
this
case.
taxpayer
was
organized
in
1916.
no
ruling
was
requested
as
far
as
we
know
no
tax
returns
were
ever
filed
until
1945,
and
no
tax
was
ever
paid.
it
is
possible
that
it
thought
it
was
exempt
on
the
basis
of
an
office
decision
of
the
internal
revenue
service
issued
in
1920
with
regard
to
an
automobile
club.
as
mr.
alvord
has
pointed
out
in
1934,
the
commissioner
or
internal
revenue
issued
a
ruling
which
we
say
is
erroneous
and
has
been
shown
by
the
courts
to
be
erroneous
to
this
club
stating
that
it
was
exempt
from
income
tax.
and
said
you
don't
have
to
file
returns
all
the
way
back.
you
won't
have
to
file
any
returns
in
the
future
unless
you
change
your
method
of
operation,
organization,
or
purposes.
in
1938,
a
letter
of
erroneous
ruling
was
issued
to
the
same
taxpayer
reaffirming
the
1934
ruling.
now,
during
all
this
time,
the
commissioner
was
far
from
title
in
this
field.
he
had
been
busy
in
1928,
issuing
two
other
erroneous
rulings
which
were
published
as
general
counsel
memorandum.
one
of
them
related
to
an
association
of
automobile
clubs.
the
other
related
to
a
local
automobile
club,
and
held
in
both
cases
that
they
were
exempt
under
this
section
101
(9)
which
exempts
social
clubs.
in
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
well,
sir
it
was
--
it
is
finally
been
determined
by
the
courts
that
all
those
rulings
were
erroneous
because
these
clubs,
as
far
as
we've
been
able
to
determine,
have
not
changed
their
purposes
or
their
activities
or
their
organization.
therefore
the
--
there
are
three
circuits
in
the
tax
court
now
tell
us
that
these
never
--
cannot
come
within
the
statute.
the
statute
has
been
fundamentally
the
same
all
these
years.
so
this
is
a
case
of
a
committee
of
errors
on
the
part
of
the
commissioner.
mr.
john
n.
stull
no,
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
in
1949
and
1950,
your
honor.
mr.
john
n.
stull
no,
sir.
this
is
a
relatively
new
thing
and
apparently
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
that
is
correct.
i
think
it
is
--
it
was
a
mistake
of
law
in
this
case
though,
because
it's
certain
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
well
finally,
in
this
--
in
1943,
the
commissioner
woke
up
and
issued
another
general
counsel's
memorandum.
now,
mr.
alvord
has
been
somewhat
disparaging
of
a
general
counsel's
memorandum
and
although
it
doesn't
appear
on
the
record,
i
can
tell
the
court
that
a
general
counsel's
memorandum
being
an
opinion
of
the
general
counsel,
when
it
is
published
in
the
internal
revenue
board
the
way
this
way
for
general
circulation
to
the
public.
it
is
approved
by
the
commissioner's
office,
therefore,
it
is
a
ruling
of
the
revenue
service
and
not
merely
just
an
opinion
of
the
general
counsel
of
the
treasury.
this
ruling
was
published
in
the
internal
revenue
board
in
1943.
it
stated
that
it
was
reconsidering
the
status
and
all
these
automobile
clubs
or
rather
the
status
of
an
association
of
automobile
clubs.
and
it
was
obviously
directed
and
it's
been
admitted
that
it
was
directed
at
the
american
automobile
association
not
at
a
local
club.
this
ruling
also
revoked
both
of
those
two
1928
published
gcms,
one
of
which
had
to
do
with
an
association
of
automobile
club,
the
other
of
which
had
to
do
with
a
local
automobile
club.
as
a
result
of
the
publication
of
this
general
counsel's
memorandum
in
1943,
the
commissioner
started
looking
into
all
the
status
of
all
of
these
clubs.
he
did
not
want
to
revoke
without
giving
anybody
a
chance.
so
he
started
going
through
his
records
and
looking
for
those
who
had
never
filed
for
an
exemption
anyway.
he
got
around
to
a
great
many
of
them
in
1943,
but
government
being
what
it
is,
he
didn't
get
around
to
this
particular
club
until
1945.
and
at
that
time,
he
wrote
a
letter
and
said
in
the
light
of
the
1943
published
gcm
were
reconsidering
the
problem
of
your
exemption,
will
you
please
submit
information
so
that
we
can
find
out
whether
you
are
distinguishable
from
it.
as
a
result
of
the
information
that
was
submitted,
a
ruling
was
issued
to
the
taxpayer,
which
stated
that
it
was
no
longer
exempt.
it
said,
"you
are
not
required
to
file
income
tax
returns
for
periods
commencing
before
january
1,
1943."
that
was
because
the
gcm
was
published
for
everybody
to
see
in
1943.
but
you
will
be
required
and
are
required
to
file
income
and
excess
products
tax
returns
for
years
beginning
after,
i
think
it
was
december
31,
1943.
at
any
rate,
these
taxpayers
are
on
a
calendar
year
basis
and
he
was
required
to
file
and
did
file
in
1945
income
and
excess
profit
tax
returns
covering
the
years
1943
and
1944.
the
assessment
or
rather
the
notice
of
deficiency
finally
after
a
great
many
negotiations
between
revenue
and
the
taxpayer
was
issued
in
1950.
now,
if
the
statute
of
limitations
and
that
is
a
question
on
this
case
began
to
run
as
we
think
it
did
when
those
returns
were
filed
in
1945
at
the
request
of
the
commissioner
and
not
at
some
time
back
in
1943
or
1944,
then
there's
no
question
in
this
case
that
the
notice
of
deficiency
was
timely.
now
the
taxpayer
here
seems
to
be
saying,
first,
that
this
revocation
of
its
ruling
in
1945,
and
direction
to
file
in
1943
was
a
retroactive
revocation
and
furthermore,
it
was
unfair.
now
i
think
that
if
it
is
analyzed
that
this
1943
ruling
was
issued
to
the
american
automobile
club,
it
was
published
in
the
internal
revenue
board
for
everyone
to
see.
the
taxpayer
here
is
associated
with
the
american
automobile
club.
it
pays
a
substantial
amount
of
dues
to
it
every
year
and
it's
represented
on
the
board
of
directors.
so
far,
counsel
has
not
admitted
knowing
the
existence
of
this
ruling.
but
he
certainly
hasn't
denied
it.
and
it
seems
to
us,
pretty
incredible,
that
they
didn't
know
about
that
ruling.
mr.
john
n.
stull
we're
--
this
--
this
part
of
the
argument,
your
honor,
is
that
there
was
never
a
retroactive
revocation
anyway.
as
far
as
the
law
is
concerned,
in
our
view,
they
were
either
exempt
under
the
law
or
they
weren't
and
there
was
nothing
the
commissioner
could
do
to
make
an
exempt.
mr.
john
n.
stull
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
i
don't
know
honestly
what
more
the
taxpayer
wants
in
this
case.
here
was
a
published
ruling.
it
referred
to
a
former
ruling
dealing
with
an
--
a
local
club.
so
therefore,
it
seems
to
me
that
they
certainly
were
unnoticed
of
it.
perhaps
they
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
could
we
have,
your
honor
i
think
we
could
have
gone
back
to
1942
but
we
didn't
in
this
case
because
the
revenue
felt
not
to
because
it
was
really
their
own
mistake
that
contributed
to
this
delinquency
here.
now,
the
complaint
seems
to
be
that
we
did
not
get
around
to
this
ruling
and
revoke
it
or
revenue
didn't
when
it
should.
therefore
they
say
that
until
our
individual
ruling
is
revoked,
we
are
still
--
we
still
continue
to
be
exempt.
and
the
revenue
service
in
the
course
of
the
year
issues
hundreds
of
rulings.
over
the
course
of
the
years,
they've
issued
thousands
of
them.
and
we
think
that
it
would
be
a
very
serious
detriment
to
the
orderly
and
collection
and
administration
of
the
revenue
if
every
individual
ruling
had
to
be
reconsidered
everytime
there's
a
reconsideration
of
policy
in
the
light
of
a
change
of
policy
or
a
court
decision
or
something
by
the
revenue
service.
and
we
think
that
a
publication
in
the
internal
revenue
board
which
is
just
for
this
purpose
is
sufficient
notice
to
taxpayers
to
come
in
and
ask
to
have
their
or
at
least
know
that
their
individual
ruling
may
no
longer
be
considered
finding
by
the
commissioner.
now
this
taxpayer
apparently
gets
that
fact
and
said,
“well
i'll
sit
around
and
wait
until
they
come
and
get
me.
they're
trying
to
enjoy
this
way
a
position
which
was
not
enjoyed
by
mostly
other
taxpayers
because
as
mr.
alvord
pointed
out
in
all
the
cases
which
were
litigated,
revenue
did
get
around
to
it
in
1943.
now
they
also
say
that
there
is
an
unfairness
here.
the
unfairness
is
a
little
hard
for
me
to
see
it.
in
the
first
place,
this
organization
can't
show
any
hardship.
perhaps
if
we
had
revoked
back
in
1916
or
1938
and
take
away
all
their
assets
or
something
like
that,
put
them
out
of
business,
it
certainly
would
have
been
hardship.
and
an
unfair
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
john
n.
stull
well,
we're
taking
a
free
good
slide
of
tax
in
this
because
an
excess
profit
tax
year
but
actually
it's
only
245,000
but
they
have
plenty
at
surplus.
we
can't
see
if
they
can
show
any
detriment.
we
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
two
years,
your
honor.
they
can't
show
any
detriment,
we
didn't
deserve
any
penalties.
in
fact,
the
only
detriment
that
they've
been
able
to
show
on
the
brief
is
that
had
they
known
that
there
they
were
not
exempt,
they
would
have
setup
a
reserve
to
pay
the
income
taxes.
well
it
seems
to
us
that
any
prudent
accounting
knowing
that
the
general
counsel
of
the
treasury
had
just
published
a
memorandum
that
these
clubs
are
not
exempt,
would
have
setup
a
reserve
in
case
they
were
finally
determined
that
they
weren't.
we
also
think
that
the
commissioner
was
not
only
being
fair
in
applying
this
ruling
to
all
taxpayers
similarly
situated
as
of
this
year.
and
there's
one
point
here,
and
of
course
we
can't
break-up
taxable
years,
so
there's
one
taxpayer
here
who
got
away
with
an
extra
six
months
because
he
was
on
a
fiscal
year
and
the
ruling
was
made
retroactive
only
to
fiscal
years
beginning
on
and
after
january
31,
1942.
so
beyond
on
august
to
june
30
of
fiscal
year,
you
get
away
with
a
little
bit
there.
but
that
was
something
that
we
couldn't
help.
it
seems
to
us
that
this
1943
ruling
applied
to
the
taxpayer
and
that
he
knew
it.
and
furthermore,
that
there
was
nothing
unfair
or
indiscrete
or
on
the
action
of
the
commissioner.
now
if
we
assume
that
this
was
a
retroactive
revocation
of
a
ruling
and
we
certainly
don't
admit
it,
then
we
have
to
look
at
the
statute
to
see
just
what
the
commissioner's
power
to
revoke
rulings
retroactively
is.
under
section
3791
(b)
of
the
1939
code,
it
is
stated
in
effect
and
that's
quoted
on
page
30
of
our
brief,
"that
the
commissioner
may
prescribe
the
extent,
if
any,
to
which
any
ruling,
regulation,
or
treasury
decision,
relating
to
the
internal
revenue
laws,
shall
be
applied
without
retroactive
effect."
in
other
words
the
discretion
of
the
commissioner
is
to
issue
in
certain
cases,
rulings
prospectively.
and
it
is
certainly
recognized
in
there
and
clear
on
its
face
that
the
commissioner
has
the
power
to
revoke
rulings,
regulations,
treasury
decisions
retroactively.
if
there's
any
question
about
that,
going
back
to
the
1921
act
when
this
--
the
predecessor
of
this
section
first
came
in,
it
was
put
in
the
law
by
the
committee
to
take
care
of
the
situation
where
the
attorney
general,
in
1919
had
revoked
an
excised
tax
ruling.
and
it
was
recognized
and
stated
in
the
committee
report
that
it
was
understood
that
no
administrative
officer
had
the
power
to
forgive
or
to
weigh
collection
of
a
tax.
therefore,
the
commissioner
was
under
a
duty
to
apply
this
ruling
of
the
attorney
general
revoking
another
ruling
retroactively
to
the
years
1917
and
1918.
and
it
was
stated
that
this
would
help
the
administration
of
the
revenue
to
--
and
prevent
the
opening
of
literally
thousands
of
cases
everytime
there
was
a
change
in
the
views
of
the
--
those
administering
the
revenue.
far
from
restricting
this
power,
it
has
been
extended
from
year
to
year
since
then.
there
have
been
a
couple
of
extensions
that
first
started
of
by
saying
that
it
could
be
this,
the
discretion
in
the
commissioner
could
be
applied
only
where
a
court
decision
did
not
require
that
the
ruling
be
revoked
retroactively.
later
on,
that
was
taken
out
of
the
law
and
although
the
first
one
just
said,
"a
treasury
decision
or
a
regulation".
it
was
finally
extended
to
the
retroactive
revocation
of
a
ruling.
now
in
this
particular
section
of
the
law
has
been
under
consideration
once
before
by
this
court
in
the
r.j.
reynolds
tobacco
company
case.
in
that
case,
under
the
broad
provision
of
22
(a)
which
it
used
to
define
income
in
the
vague
words
of
gains,
profits,
and
income,
the
commissioner
had
come
out
with
a
regulation
and
had
--
which
had
stated
that
the
purchase
and
sale
of
stock
by
a
corporation
is
a
capital
transaction
that
doesn't
give
rise
to
gain
or
loss.
mr.
john
n.
stull
if
the
court
please,
i
would
like
to
take
a
moment
to
very
briefly
summarize
the
government's
position
as
presented
yesterday.
we
are
saying
first
with
regard
to
this
ruling
question
that
there
was
not
a
retroactive
revocation
here
that
the
taxpayer
had
noticed
of
the
change
in
the
revenue
services
position
in
the
1943
ruling
and
that
owners
of
individual
rulings
cannot
be
expected
in
every
occasion
to
have
individual
notification
of
a
revocation
of
a
ruling
that
has
generally
published.
to
do
so,
it
would
put
too
much
of
a
burden
on
the
administration
of
the
revenue.
furthermore
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
taxpayer
is
asking
that
others
similarly
situated
whom
revenue
had
the
personnel
to
get
around
to
prior
to
the
time
of
getting
around
to
this
one
had
to
pay
back
the
1943
as
well
as
we're
asking
in
this
case.
we
have
not
been
able
to
see
that
they
--
that
this
taxpayer
is
being
discriminated
against.
we
have
not
been
able
to
see
that
there
is
any
detriment.
no
showing
has
been
made
by
the
taxpayer
in
this
case
of
any
detriment
at
all.
furthermore,
we
say
that
under
the
internal
revenue
code,
a
retroactive
revocation
of
a
ruling
is
allowed
that
it
is
clear
from
the
legislative
history
of
the
1921
act,
that
the
reason
for
putting
that
provision
in
the
statute
was
that
the
tax
collector
without
it
has
no
power
to
waive
a
tax
and
if
he
has
made
a
mistake
and
subsequently
retrofires
that
mistake,
he
has
to
go
back
and
collect
all
taxes
retroactively
which
are
not
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations.
and
it
was
that
particular
situation
which
was
met
by
the
statutory
provision.
this
court
has
considered
this
particular
section
of
the
internal
revenue
code
on
one
prior
occasion.
that
was
in
the
reynolds
tobacco
company
case.bear
under
the
very
broad
provisions
of
section
22
(a)
which
you
will
recall
defines
income
as
gains,
profits
and
income.
the
commissioner
issued
a
regulation
that
the
sale
and
purchase
of
stock
of
its
own
stock
by
a
corporation
is
a
capital
transaction
and
does
not
result
in
gain
or
loss.
subsequently,
that
regulation
was
amended
to
say
that
under
certain
circumstances,
it
would
result
in
gain
or
loss.
the
tax
--
the
commissioner
attempted
to
apply
that
--
that
ruling,
the
new
regulation
retroactively.
this
court,
in
its
decision,
recognized
the
power
of
the
commissioner
under
the
statute
to
correct
erroneous
regulations
with
retroactive
effect
unless
there
was
good
reason
that
such
alteration
must
operate
prospectively
only.
in
that
case,
a
good
reason
was
found
by
this
court.
they
said
that
this
regulation
had
been
outstanding
for
a
number
of
years.
congress
had
passed
successive
revenue
acts
and
was
presumed
to
have
given
at
the
step
of
law
and
that
the
commissioner
did
not
have
any
discretion
to
revoke
retroactively
what
it
was
in
effect
a
provision
of
law.
we
say
that
that
does
not
apply
in
this
particular
case.
in
the
first
place,
this
taxpayer
argues
that
it
was
acting
under
an
individual
unpublished
ruling.
we
do
not
think
that
congress
can
certainly
be
presumed
to
have
known
of
the
existence
of
this
individual
unpublished
ruling.
furthermore,
there
are
regulations
outstanding
under
this
particular
section
of
the
code.
these
regulations
merely
require
that
anyone
who
wants
to
--
who
says
that
they're
exempt
should
come
in
and
try
to
prove
to
the
commissioner
that
they
are
exempt.
if
he
--
if
the
taxpayer
is
able
to
prove
exemption
under
the
regulations,
then
the
commissioner
isn't
going
to
bother
him
anymore.
there
is
a
1935
decision,
the
board
of
tax
appeals,
in
which
an
organization
was
held
exempt
even
though
it
never
went
in
and
requested
the
commissioner
to
give
it
a
ruling
with
exempt.
they
said
that
the
--
only,
the
worst
that
could
happened
for
failure
to
comply
with
those
regulations
was
that
a
litigation
would
result
that
the
commissioner
could
resist
it.
the
commissioner
acquiesced
in
that
decision
and
has
followed
it
ever
since.
therefore,
we
don't
believe
that
there
is
any
outstanding
regulation
or
rule
which
ever
said
that
this
taxpayer
was
exempt
and
that
congress
knew
about.
now,
this
regulation
does
say
in
one
part
that
if
you
comply
with
these
particular
rules,
you
don't
have
to
file
a
return.
well,
the
taxpayer
may
say,
and
that's
the
next
point
in
the
argument,
that
he
relied
on
that
and
did
not
file
a
return.
well,
we
don't
see
how
that
could
be
true
in
this
case
in
view
of
the
1943
published
ruling.
after
all,
that
was
noticed
generally
published
for
all
the
world
to
see.
now,
taxpayer
seems
to
hint
rather
darkly
that
the
commissioner
cannot
be
trusted
with
discretion
under
these
circumstances.
well,
that
seems
to
be
right
in
the
face
of
the
statute
which
congress
has
enacted.
it
seems
to
us
that
if
congress
was
afraid
that
the
commissioner
would
abuse
his
discretion
that
it
would
have
put
the
brakes
on
it
but
it
hasn't
done
that.
it
has
in
effect
expanded
that
particular
provision
every
time
it's
come
up.
there
is
another
question
as
to
this
retroactive
revocation
and
that
has
to
do
with
the
running
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
the
law
says
that
the
statute
of
--
that
the
commissioner
can
assess
the
deficiency
in
tax
within
three
years
only,
within
three
years
from
the
time
the
return
is
filed.
and
another
section
of
the
code
says
that
if
no
return
was
filed,
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations.
the
taxpayer
here
admits
that
he
never
filed
a
tax
return,
but
he
does
say
that
the
mere
fact
that
he
was
excused
from
filing
a
tax
return
was
enough
to
start
the
statute
of
limitations.
his
authority
on
this
seems
to
be
a
decision
of
the
second
circuit,
the
balkan
national
insurance
company
case,
in
which
the
--
all
the
books
and
records
of
a
corporation
was
seized
by
the
alien
property
custodian.
the
alien
property
custodian
did
make
some
sort
of
a
return
but
it
wasn't
signed
and
didn't
really
constitute
a
return.
an
enterprising
revenue
agent,
some
years
later,
said
that
that
wasn't
a
return
and
assessed
the
deficiency.
the
second
circuit
held
in
that
case
that
after
all
the
commissioner
by
his
own
action
had
prevented
filing
of
a
return
of
this
taxpayer
or
rather
the
government
had
and
then
another
branch
of
the
government
could
not
take
advantage
of
such
action.
here,
we
say
that
that
--
they
were
never
presented
from
filing
a
return
as
in
that
particular
case.
there
is
one
further
point
on
this
and
that
is
that
during
the
years
in
question,
certain
information
returns
were
filed
by
the
taxpayer
in
this
case.
these
are
form
990
and
do
not,
in
anyway,
represent
or
resemble
the
regular
corporation
income
tax
return.
now,
in
order
to
understand
exactly
what
was
the
reason
behind
the
requirement
of
filing
this
return,
we
have
to
go
back
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
1943
act
when
it
was
put
in.
at
that
time,
congress
was
becoming
very
concerned
about
charities,
which
were
operating
business
in
competition
with
regular
taxpaying
organizations.
they
were
also
concerned
with
so-called
theatre-corporations
where
they
earn
a
spaghetti
business
or
some
other
business
and
all
their
profits
go
to
a
charity
because
all
their
stock
is
owned
by
it
and
they
say
they're
exempt.
congress
in
1943
wanted
to
do
something
about
that
but
they
said
that
we
are
in
possession
of
sufficient
information
to
be
able
to
act
intelligently
on
this
problem.
so
therefore,
they
directed
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
to
require
organizations
which
have
been
given
exemption
to
file
certain
information
in
order
to
allow
a
study
of
the
problem
to
be
made.
this,
in
other
words,
was
merely
for
information
gathering
purposes.
it
was
not
for
tax
collection
purposes.
i
think
possibly
the
distinction
can
be
brought
out
by
two
decisions
of
this
court.
the
first
one
was
in
the
germantown
trust
company
case.
there,
the
trust
company
put
a
lot
of
small
trust
funds
together
in
order
to
make
more
efficient
operation.
they
filed
a
fiduciary
income
tax
return
on
which
they
listed
all
the
income,
all
the
deductions
and
all
the
people
who
are
interested
in
this
fund.
they
filed
this
fiduciary
return
and
they
later
on
a
revenue
agent
came
around
and
said,
“you
are
taxable
as
a
corporation
not
as
a
trust,
therefore,
you
filed
the
wrong
return
and
the
statute
has
not
started.”
this
court
in
that
case
said,
“you,
the
commissioner,
were
in
possession
of
sufficient
facts
to
know
how
to
compute
that
tax.
what
more
do
you
want?”
and
said
that
started
the
statute.
then,
the
lane-wells
case
came
up.
in
that
case,
congress
had
levied
a
very
steep
surtax
on
personal
holding
companies.
the
commissioner
said
that
on
his
regular
form
1120
corporation
income
tax
return
put
a
question,
“are
you
a
personal
holding
company?”
if
so,
file
form
1120
(h)
which
requested
further
information.”
in
the
lane-wells
case,
taxpayer
said
no
to
that,
he
is
not
a
personal
holding
company
and
did
not
file
form
1120
(h).
after
the
three-year
period
had
expired,
the
commissioner
assessed
the
deficiency
for
the
personal
holding
company
tax
and
this
court
said
that
was
correct
that
--
that
return
on
1120
had
not
started
the
statute
of
limitations
running,
that
the
commissioner
was
perfectly
within
his
rights
in
requiring
that
information
on
form
1120
(h).
and
since
he
was
not
in
possession
of
sufficient
information
to
compute
the
tax,
the
statute
of
limitations
had
not
started.
it
was
made
--
the
argument
was
made
in
the
--
in
the
lane-wells
case
but
this
court
did
not
agree
with
it
that
the
commissioner
could
have
required
that
information.
on
the
form
1120
(h)
and
not
necessarily
require
another
return,
but
this
court
said
that
availed
him
nothing.
now,
on
this
form
990,
there
is
not
sufficient
information
to
compute
the
tax.
for
example,
these
are
excess
profits
tax
here
that
we're
talking
about
here.
an
excess
profit
tax
depends
upon
and
involved
average
base
period
net
income
credit
or
a
historical
invested
capital
credit.
there
is
no
information
as
to
any
of
that
on
these
returns.
furthermore,
the
commissioner
could
not
even
have
computed
the
income
tax
because
under
world
war
ii
excess
profits
tax,
there
was,
what
was
known
as
the
two-basket
approach,
that
is
that
you
had
to
compute
income
subject
to
excess
profits
tax
first
which
was
income
done
in
a
certain
prescribed
way
minus
the
credit.
then,
that
income
was
not
subject
to
the
income
tax.
in
other
words,
you
could
not
compute
the
income
tax
unless
you
knew
the
--
what
the
income
subject
to
excess
profits
tax
was.
we
say
that
nowhere
at
no
time
were
we
in
possession
of
sufficient
information
to
start
this
to
--
in
order
to
compute
that
tax.
now
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
your
honor
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
as
far
as
this
point
goes,
yes,
sir.
on
the
retroactive
face
of
this
case,
i
don't
think
we
couldn't
have
gone
back
to
1916.
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
i
think
that
that
is
certainly
the
only
sure
and
certain
way
of
doing
it.
mr.
john
n.
stull
i
understand
from
revenue
that
there
are
organizations
that
do
such
a
thing
up
until
the
1954
code
because
the
1954
code
now
says
that
the
commissioner
can
prescribe
an
information
return
which
will
start
the
statute.
mr.
john
n.
stull
your
honor,
i
--
i
must
misunderstood
the
question.
may
i
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
--
restate
my
answer?
mr.
john
n.
stull
my
answer
to
the
question
is
that
under
the
law,
there
seems
to
be
no
reason
why
the
commissioner
could
not
go
back
to
1942
or
any
other
time.
mr.
john
n.
stull
or
even
1916
as
far
as
that
goes.
but
we
don't
think
that
the
commissioner,
as
a
practical
matter,
should
be
allowed
to
go
back.
we
think
that
in
this
particular
case
that
he
had
the
notice
in
--
that
this
taxpayer
had
the
notice
in
1943.
and
that
notice
plus
the
statute,
we
think,
it
makes
this
a
perfectly
fair
application
of
a
retroactive
revocation.
now,
i
don't
--
i
--
i
can't
honestly
tell
you
whether
the
government
would
be
here
if
we
had
gone
back
to
1942
or
1941
and
1916.
i
don't
think
that
we
would
have
argued
that
case
but
i
don't
know.
i
think
just
--
we're
--
we're
here
on
this
--
under
these
facts.
mr.
john
n.
stull
well,
as
a
practical
matter
in
this
case,
your
honor,
they
have
published
this
gcm
in
which
they
said
they
would
not
go
back.
and
i
don't
think
that
they
--
that
is
a
type
of
ruling
which
we
could
say
was
erroneous.
mr.
john
n.
stull
well,
if
--
if
revenue
does
that,
i
hope
congress
does
(inaudible).
i
don't
think
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
well,
i
would
hope
that
this
court
would
step
in
that
situation,
your
honor,
if
congress
didn't.
one
final
point
on
this
business
of
the
statute
starting
the
other
information
returns
starting
the
statute
of
limitations
running,
that
is
that
in
1950,
congress
as
a
result
of
these
studies,
which
was
started
with
the
filing
of
the
information
returns
in
1943,
did
enact
very
elaborate
provisions
as
to
taxing,
what
they
call
unrelated
business
and
net
income
by
these
charities
and
business
and
also
taxing
theatre-organizations.
in
that
particular
year,
they
said
that
the
information
return
would
start
the
statute
of
limitations
running
for
any
organization
which
would
be
exempt
or
if
not,
for
the
fact
that
it
was
engaged
in
a
business.
in
other
words,
they
seem
to
recognize
that
that
return
was
not
going
to
start
the
statute
and
they
also
seem
to
say,
“we're
going
to
take
care
of
this
people
but
we're
not
going
to
take
care
of
the
rest
of
it.”
it
wasn't
until
the
1954
code
that
they
were
taken
care
of.
now,
taxpayer
here
cannot
come
in
under
that
1950
amendment
for
two
reasons.
one
is
that
he's
not
engaged
in
business
and
the
other
is
that
it
applied
--
it
did
not
apply
to
--
as
deficiencies
which
had
been
asserted
prior
to
september
20,
1950.
and
the
commissioner
had
asserted
the
deficiency
here
sometime,
i
think,
it
was
in
january
or
february
of
1950
and
anyway
--
and
anyway,
it
was
before
that
time.
so
it
seems
to
us
that
congress
has
recognized
this
problem
and
if
there's
any
equity
in
the
situation,
they
had
certainly
rectified
it
in
the
1954
code.
the
final
problem
we
have
here
is
this
problem
with
prepaid
income.
it's
--
the
old
question
which
many
phases
of
which
had
been
before
this
court
on
previous
times.
it's
a
question
of
tax
accounting
versus
commercial
accounting.
the
commissioner
says,
“the
taxpayer's
particular
method
here
is
not
allowed
under
the
revenue
laws.”
the
taxpayer
said
--
says
that
my
method
clearly
reflects
income,
so
therefore,
it
is
allowed
under
the
revenue
laws.
if
i
may
make
an
illustration
of
it,
suppose
the
duties
here
are
$12,
an
individual
becomes
a
member
of
this
organization
on
october
1,
1950.
he
pays
his
$12.
he
is
entitled
to
receive
the
services
of
the
organization
for
the
next
12
months.
taxpayer
says
that
actually
the
cost
of
those
services
is
going
to
be
incurred
over
the
next
12
months.
so
therefore,
what
he
would
do
in
the
situation
is
to
take
$3
in
the
income
for
1950,
$1
for
october,
$1
for
november
and
$1
for
december.
that
is
all
he
paid
the
tax
on.
the
rest
of
it
would
be
apparently
shown
on
the
balance
sheet
as
a
differed
liability.
now,
this
is
in
the
face
of
the
fact
that
he
has
all
this
cash
on
hand,
he
has
it
in
the
bank
account
and
he
can
use
it
for
any
purpose
allowed
by
the
charter.
the
$9
that's
left
over,
he
says,
is
not
taxable
until
the
following
year
because
that
is
the
year
in
which
the
services
will
be
rendered.
i
understand
that
the
same
--
almost
the
same
thing
to
be
accomplish
by
a
reserve
for
estimated
expenses.
in
other
words,
if
they
have
a
pretty
good
idea
that
if
the
$12
they
take
in,
it
will
cost
him
$10
to
service
all
this
particular
member.
they
could
deduct
the
reserve
under
commercial
accounting
system
of
$10
so
that
they
would
only
be
taxed
on
$2
in
that
year.
reserves
--
there
were
few
reserves
allowed
by
the
revenue
laws
but
such
as
reserve
for
depreciation,
depletion,
pay
debts
and
so
on
but
no
reserve
for
estimated
expenses.
and
i
doubt
that
taxpayer
would
be
here
if
he
had
handled
it
that
way.
now,
i
don't
want
to
get
into
a
discussion
of
a
proper
method
of
handling
this
under
commercial
accounting
because
i
do
not
think
that
we're
concerned
here
with
the
computation
of
net
profit
under
commercial
accounting
standards.
we
are
here
concerned
with
the
computation
of
net
income
under
the
internal
revenue
code,
but
i
do
question
whether
even
under
a
commercial
accounting
principles,
this
particular
method
clearly
reflects
income.
can
you
say
when
somebody
comes
in
on
october
and
pays
his
dues
for
the
next
12
months
that
he
is
going
to
require
one-twelfth
of
the
services
for
which
he
is
entitled
each
month?
what
if
he
goes
to
a
hospital?
it
may
be
a
small
point
and
i'm
sure
there
isn't
very
much
involved
but
i
am
ought
to
know
what
they
would
do
with
the
case
of
a
life
member.
for
$250,
you
can
become
a
life
member
in
this
organization
and
you're
excused
from
paying
dues
for
the
rest
of
your
life
and
you're
entitled
to
services
for
the
rest
of
your
life.
i
suppose
they
would
find
some
way
of
prorating
that
over
your
life
expectancy
in
accordance
with
actuarial
tables.
at
any
event,
under
the
internal
revenue
laws,
we
are
concerned
mostly
with
an
annual
accounting
period
at
the
end
of
every
annual
accounting
period
you
have
to
--
you
have
to
compute
your
tax
and
find
out
what
your
income
is,
what
your
deductions
are
as
of
that
time.
there
are
very
few
exceptions
to
this.
there,
of
course,
is
the
net
operating
loss
carry-forward
and
carry-back
which
is
an
exception
to
it.
there
is
an
exception
of
completed
contract
basis.
there
are
other
--
few
other
exceptions
in
the
law.
but
nevertheless,
outside
of
those
few
specific
exceptions
is
an
annual
accounting
period
not
a
transactional
basis
as
this
taxpayer
is
contending.
now,
i
think
that
our
whole
argument
here
stems
from
a
decision
of
this
court
in
1932,
north
american
oil
consolidated
company
case,
in
which
this
court
said
that
if
a
taxpayer
receives
earnings
under
a
claim
of
right
without
restriction
as
to
disposition,
he
has
received
income
even
though
in
a
later
year,
he
may
have
to
return
it
or
it
may
have
to
be
given
back
or
spend
it
for
some
other
reasons.
this
here
--
this
income
here
or
these
earnings,
these
dues
here
are
received
with
no
restriction.
there
is
no
trust
fund.
they
were
not
segregated
in
the
bank
account.
they
could
be
used
at
any
time.
we
think
that
this
case
falls
exactly
under
the
north
american
case
which
was
reaffirmed
in
1951
by
this
court
and
the
lewis
case
in
which
they
said
that
the
claim
of
right
interpretation
of
the
tax
laws
has
long
been
used
to
give
finality
to
the
accounting
period
that
is
now
deeply
rooted
in
the
federal
tax
system,
but
this
taxpayer
in
this
--
in
our
particular
case,
we're
in
the
accrual
basis
and
it
doesn't
apply
to
us
because
we
are
in
the
accrual
basis.
i
think
that
a
reading
of
the
north
american
oil
consolidated
case
shows
that
in
that
case,
the
board
of
tax
appeals
went
off
on
an
erroneous
tangent
in
--
when
it
had
the
case
before
it
and
never
did
make
a
finding
as
to
whether
the
taxpayer
there
was
on
the
cash
or
the
accrual
basis.
this
court
in
deciding
the
case
said
that
regardless
of
what
basis
the
taxpayer
was
on,
if
these
earnings
are
received
under
a
claim
of
right
without
restriction
as
to
disposition,
they
are
taxable.
now,
i
don't
think
that
ordinarily
under
the
--
these
cases
under
the
1939
code,
we
should
pay
any
attention
at
all
to
the
1954
code
because
we've
been
told
by
the
committee
that
we're
not
to.
but
i
think
that
it's
interesting
and
important
to
know
what
the
1954
code
did
in
this
case.
the
1954
code
had
provisions
in
its
sections
452
and
462,
one
of
which
provided
for
deferral
of
prepaid
income
exactly
what
taxpayer
is
claiming
here.
the
other
section
provided
for
a
reserve
for
estimated
expenses.
the
difficulty
with
those
sections
was
that
the
transitional
period
would
have
been
so
expensive
that
it
would
have
practically
wreck
the
economy.
and
when
that
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
congress
by
the
treasury,
they
realized
that
it
couldn't
be
afforded,
so
they
revote
those
two
sections.
now,
those
two
sections
provided
very
restrictive
provisions
as
to
deferral
prepaid
income
and
reserves
for
estimated
expenses.
they
did
not
purport
to
(inaudible)
commercial
accounting
with
tax
accounting
as
taxpayer
claims
here
should
be
the
case.
they
realized
that
it
just
couldn't
be
done,
so
actually
what
it
was,
was
sort
of
a
compromise.
for
instance,
if
i
saw
a
refrigerator
for
$200
and
i
give
a
ten-year
guarantee
with
that
refrigerator
for
which
i
charged
$10,
under
the
deferred
income
of
the
1954
code
even
though
i
had
to
do
those
--
do
the
repairs
and
so
on
over
a
period
of
ten
years,
you
could
not
differ
it
for
more
than
six
years.
that
was
the
longest
that
it
could
be
differed.
in
other
words,
congress
knew
that
they
weren't
taking
care
of
the
entire
problem
but
they
were
doing
the
best
they
could
in
a
very
restricted
way.
now,
what
this
taxpayer
is
asking
this
court
to
do
in
this
case
is
to
put
its
blessing
upon
a
method
of
handling
prepaid
income
which
will
have
none
of
those
restrictions
on,
which
congress
saw
fit
to
put
on
them
and
thought
were
necessary
in
this
--
since
repealed
legislation.
in
other
words,
i
guess
that
would
allow
commercial
accountants
to
go
wild.
they
would
be
able
to
use
any
of
their
rules.
i
don't
think
that
that
is
what
congress
intended.
now,
what
congress
did
say
when
it
repealed
the
law
is
that
something
should
be
done
of
that
in
this
situation
that
it's
just
isn't
fair.
and
so
they
said,
“we're
going
to
study
the
situation.
we're
going
to
find
a
way
around
this
particular
question
of
transition
which
will
cost
the
government
so
much
money,
it
can't
be
afforded
and
we're
going
to
study
it.
now,
i
understand
that
no
subcommittee
is
studying
at
the
moment,
but
i
don't
know
of
any
legislation
which
they've
been
able
to
come
up
with
at
the
moment.
but
we
do
think
it's
a
problem
entirely
for
legislation.
mr.
john
n.
stull
no,
sir,
because
not
--
not
unless
they
come
through
with
this.
the
congress
come
through
with
legislation.
if
they
come
through
with
legislation,
that's
retroactive
to
1954.
i
doubt
if
it
would
be
retroactive
if
it
were
passed.
if
they
passed
it
this
year,
we'll
probably
start
for
all
years
beginning
at
1957.
now,
taxpayer
also
relies
on
this
--
in
this
case
on
a
case
called
the
beacon
publishing
company.
in
that
case,
the
circuit
court
put
its
blessing
on
this
method
of
differing
income
and
said
that
the
north
american
oil
consolidated
case
and
subsequent
decisions
of
this
court
were
distinguishable
and
the
beacon
case
also
did
something
else.
that
is
they
said
that
if
a
taxpayer
who
had
been
reporting
on
the
basis
of
tax
accounting
under
the
north
american
oil
decision
of
this
court
wish
to
change
to
this
deferral
method
that
he
could
do
it
in
that
case
because
said
the
court
that
is
merely
the
correction
of
an
erroneous
method
of
accounting
of
--
of
an
error
made
in
his
computation
of
taxable
income.
it's
not
a
change
in
method
of
accounting.
now,
counsel
for
the
taxpayer
here
said
yesterday
in
oral
argument
that
in
the
committee
reports
on
the
repeal
of
this
1954
code
amendment,
that
it
was
indicated
that
beacon
would
be
accepted.
i
don't
think
he
could
mean
that
because
if
it
was
indicated
there
that
beacon
would
be
accepted
on
both
counts,
then
they're
saying
the
economy
can't
afford
our
particular
methods
of
deferring
income
but
we're
putting
our
blessing
on
a
case
which
does
even
worst,
goes
even
further.
so
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
possibility
of
saying
that
beacon
was
accepted
and
there's
a
letter
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
which
was
--
well,
which
is
placed
in
the
committee
report
in
connection
with
that
repeal,
in
which
it
says
that
the
repeal
of
section
452,
and
this
was
an
order
to
give
assurance
to
the
committee,
will
not
be
considered
by
the
department,
the
treasury
department,
as
either
acceptance
or
rejection
by
congress
of
beacon
or
any
other
judicial
decisions
outstanding
at
this
time.
