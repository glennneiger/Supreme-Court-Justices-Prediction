mr.
ellsworth
c.
alvord
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
ellsworth
c.
alvord
we
are
here
on
certiorari
to
the
sixth
circuit.
the
facts
are
stipulated
and
there
are
three
issues
in
the
case,
almost
three
different
cases.
i
will
attempt
to
cover
the
first
two
issues
in
the
order
in
which
they
appear
in
the
government
brief
and
mr.
berry
will
cover
the
third
issue.
the
first
issue
does
the
commissioner
have
power
to
revoke
retroactively
a
ruling
of
some
nine-year
standing,
eleven-year
standing,
granting
tax
exemption
to
the
petitioner.
the
second
issue
is,
did
he
act
within
the
applicable
statute
of
limitations.
the
third
issue
which
mr.
berry
will
cover
is,
did
the
commissioner
have
power
to
compel
the
petitioner
to
change
his
long
standing,
consistent
methods
of
accounting.
these
are
the
facts
that
were
stipulated
and
relatively
simple.
the
petitioner
is
an
automobile
service
organization,
organized
under
the
nonprofit
laws
of
michigan
having
no
stockholders,
only
members
governed
by
the
board
of
directors.
like
in
other,
certificate
of
incorporations
and
by-laws,
all
of
which
are
in
the
record.
its
principal
purpose
is
exactly
what
we
all
know
an
automobile
association
is
to
give
its
members
emergency
service.
if
your
car
doesn't
start
in
the
morning,
you
get
stuck
on
the
road,
you
may
call
and
service
is
sent.
the
club
pays
the
cost
of
the
service
under
contracts
of
various
service
garages.
that
is
its
principal
function.
it
also
supplies
road
service
to
its
members,
and
less,
rising
where
the
roads
are
good
and
where
they're
bad.
it
also
gives
a
magazine.
its
membership
is
on
annual
basis.
it
has
never
paid
a
dividend
and
could
not
pay
a
dividend.
early
in
1934,
it
was
concerned
about
the
application
of
section
215
of
the
national
recovery
act
which
imposed
a
capital
stock
tax
upon
corporations.
and
as
a
result
of
its
inquiry
the
commissioner
wrote
a
letter
and
said,
"please
send
me
the
facts"
and
imposed
the
question
there
which
call
for
a
very
detailed
facts.
in
june
of
1934,
the
commissioner
by
letter
advised
the
petitioner,
that
was
exempt
from
tax
under
what
is
now
known
as
section
101
(9),
the
same
section
under
which
golf
clubs,
private
golf
clubs
are
exempted,
the
metropolitan
club
and
the
press
club,
and
all
recreations,
social
subject
exempt
a
value
of
the
petitioner
that
was
exempt
under
101(9).
and
that
it
need
not
file
income
tax
returns,
either
for
the
past
or
for
the
future.
somewhat
later
in
1937
the
commissioner
in
accordance
with
his
practice
have
attempted
to
check
on
tax
exempt
organizations
or
organizations
which
have
been
ruled
tax
exempt
as
for
another
questionnaire
with
a
copy
filled
in
and
returned.
a
second
letter
came
out
a
few
months
later
saying,
"we
affirm
our
prior
ruling
that
you
are
not
--
that
you're
exempt
and
you
were
not
called
upon
to
prior
corporate
income
tax
returns".
and
there
the
matter
stood.
until
my
point
of
view,
1945
but
there's
an
intervening
factor
of
no
consequence
although
the
government
pays
a
great
deal
of
weight
to
it.
a
general
counsel
memorandum
which
has
nothing
but
the
opinion
of
the
general
counsel
of
the
bureau
of
internal
revenue
given
to
the
commission
of
internal
revenue
for
his
guidance
which
he
may
follow
or
my
not.
he
often
does
not.
it
was
published
in
the
internal
revenue
bulletin.
that
memorandum
was
addressed
to
the
3
a's,
which
is
the
washington
organization
which
is
a
federation
of
all
the
various
local
clubs
such
as
the
michigan
club.
now
so
you
won't
be
confused.
in
the
district,
the
3
a's
also
has
a
separate
division
which
operates
like
the
michigan
club
did,
but
that's
not
the
principal
function
of
the
3
a's.
in
fact
gcm
said,
"you
3
a's
are
not
exempt
despite
our
prior
ruling.
and
in
my
point
of
view,
that's
all
that
happened.
in
1945,
the
commissioner
writes
the
petitioner
a
letter
saying
that
in
the
light
of
this
gcm,
we
are
reconsidering
whether
automobile
clubs
and
you
specifically
are
to
be
exempt
under
101
(9).
please
send
this
information
and
the
information
was
presented.
it
was
considered
by
the
commissioner
and
on
july
11th,
1945
i
think
it
was.
he
wrote
to
petitioner.
wrote
a
long
letter,
it's
in
the
record
saying
"we
have
given
thorough
consideration.
we
have
now
changed
our
views
about
clubs
under
section
101
(9).
we
think
that
there
must
be
some
friendship,
some
social
--
social
purposes
involved.
and
we
rule
that
you
have
no
social
friendship
purposes,
no
association
together,”
and
he
was
right
in
that.
“and
therefore
we
rule
that
you
were
not
exempt
from
taxes.
from
that
moment
on,
we
do
not
dispute,
mr.
(inaudible)
that
anytime
he
could
say
"gentlemen
as
to
the
future,
i've
changed
my
mind.”
but
the
letter
goes
on
to
say,
his
letter
is
in
1945,
says
that
you
must
now
file
returns
for
1943
and
1944
for
the
two
years
preceding,
two
years
and
six
in
one
case
plus
six
months
preceding
with
the
specific
revocation
ruling.
returns
were
filed
under
protest
and
statements
on
the
returns
were
made,
prior
returns
of
income
and
excess,
profits,
taxes
had
not
been
filed.
because
of
reliance
upon
the
tax
exempt
rulings
which
have
been
enforced
to
some
10
to
11
years.
mr.
ellsworth
c.
alvord
he
does
not,
sir.
i
will
come
to
that.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
anywhere
which
gives
the
commissioner
that
power.
the
regulations
under
which
he
was
acted,
regulation
111
which
we
cite
to
you,
in
my
opinion
denied
them
both.
the
regulation
says
that
when
the
commissioner
determines
that
an
organization
is
exempt,
not
quite
in
those
words
it
says
when
an
organization
establishes
its
right
to
exemption,
which
means
when
the
commissioner
agrees
with
it.
from
that
time
on,
no
returns
are
required
for
income
tax
purposes.
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
regulation
which
gives
the
commissioner
the
power
to
change
his
mind
retroactively.
he
doesn't
need
the
power
as
to
the
future.
mr.
ellsworth
c.
alvord
as
to
the
future?
mr.
ellsworth
c.
alvord
that
your
honor
is
--
mr.
ellsworth
c.
alvord
that
--
mr.
ellsworth
c.
alvord
that
your
honor
is
a
very
appropriate
question.
the
only
power
there
is
to
make
rulings
of
this
kind
outside
of
the
regulations
which
are
promulgated
by
the
commissioner
with
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
under
ample
authority
of
the
statute.
the
only
power
is
the
duty
imposed
upon
the
commission
who
administer
the
law.
mr.
ellsworth
c.
alvord
under
our
tax
laws,
your
honor
as
you
know,
we
go
forth
on
an
annual
basis.
our
status
in
1945
would
be
exactly
the
same
as
our
status
in
1944
and
1943
but
1945
is
a
year
under
determination
or
perhaps
1957
is
a
year
under
determination.
the
commissioner
is
charged
with
the
duty
of
collecting
taxes
from
corporations
for
the
year
1945.
he
must
decide
which
is
a
corporation,
which
is
not,
which
corporation
is
taxable,
which
is
not.
that's
an
annual
duty
imposed
upon
him.
that
duty
sir
is
found
in
the
statute
itself.
mr.
ellsworth
c.
alvord
the
statute
--
mr.
ellsworth
c.
alvord
the
statute
fixes
the
exemptions.
from
one
year
to
another,
the
commissioner
has
no
power
to
change
the
statute.
but
when
he
rules,
as
he
does
and
as
a
consistent
practice
over
many,
many,
many
years
he
gives
rulings,
rulings,
rulings
everyday
with
respect
to
taxability
or
non-taxability.
i'm
coming
more
directly
to
the
point,
your
honor
if
i
may,
when
he
follows
that
long
continuing
practice,
well-known
to
congress
authorized
under
the
regulations,
then
he
has
the
power
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
corporation
such
as
the
automobile
club
here
is
taxable
or
whether
or
not
it's
exempted.
he
exercised
that
function.
mr.
ellsworth
c.
alvord
you
honor,
in
reply
to
your
question,
i
must
be
a
little
bit
more
specific.
mr.
ellsworth
c.
alvord
there
is
nothing
in
the
tax
law
as
which
it
requires
me
to
apply
for
a
ruling.
mr.
ellsworth
c.
alvord
i
may,
if
i
wish,
that
if
i
wish
i
will
get
a
ruling.
now
the
regulations
in
this
case
are
a
little
bit
different
from
that
because
maybe
that
some
courts
have
indicated
he
went
beyond
his
power
because
the
--
regulation
111
in
this
case,
say
that
i
must
apply
for
a
ruling
or
i
cannot
be
exempt.
(inaudible)
but
that
isn't
--
we
did
comply
with
the
regulations,
we
did
get
a
ruling
and
that
ruling
was
enforced
for
many,
many
years.
mr.
ellsworth
c.
alvord
the
factual
situation
is
not
changed
in
the
slightest
and
that
isn't
admitted
to.
the
purpose
of
our
organization
and
methods
of
our
doing
business
remained
exactly
the
same
through
all
the
years.
mr.
ellsworth
c.
alvord
in
the
absence
of
the
decision
of
the
commissioner.
mr.
ellsworth
c.
alvord
the
best
answer
i
can
give
you
on
that
sir
is
four
judges
thought
i
was
exempt,
not
in
my
case
that
an
automobile
club
would
be
exempt.
there
is
a
few
years
of
litigation
on
it.
mr.
ellsworth
c.
alvord
not
at
the
time
of
the
rulings.
(voice
overlap)
--
that
--
that
must
be
very
(voice
overlap)
not
at
the
time
of
the
rulings.
mr.
ellsworth
c.
alvord
that
i
can
interpret
this
issue.
the
commissioner,
with
respect
to
corporations
which
had
received
no
ruling,
with
respect
to
automobile
clubs
including
these
3
a's,
proceeded
against
them
beginning
in
1943.
he
had
reached
the
decision
based
upon
an
unpublished
decision
have
enforced.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
income
taxes,
but
it
had
only
to
do
with
the
dues
tax,
whether
dues
to
revoke
more
health
profit
(inaudible).
whether
the
member
paying
those
should
pay
a
tax
on
that,
the
court
said
no.
based
on
that
decision,
they
jumped
over
to
the
exemption
101
(9)
and
they
say,
"we
think
automobile
clubs
are
no
longer
exempted".
and
we
go
through
litigation.
the
first
case
in
litigation
rule
that
the
automobile
club
of
california
was
exempted.
mr.
ellsworth
c.
alvord
ruled
that
it
was
an
appeal
that
opinion
was
reversed.
at
the
time
this
case
was
tried
before
the
tax
court,
there
were
at
least
three,
i
think,
four
circuit
court
of
appeals
decisions
against
this.
so
that
we
stipulated
on
the
tax
court
that
from
1945
on,
currently
and
for
the
future,
we
would
not
be
exempted.
mr.
ellsworth
c.
alvord
that
is
a
very
possible
inference,
yes
sir.
and
that
of
course
is
the
condition
that
the
government
takes
but
to
me
it
makes
no
difference.
if
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
if
we
were
exempted,
then
we
wouldn't
be
here.
we'd
be
here
unquestionably
--
if
it
all
would
be
on
the
question
of
exemption.
we
are
here
on
a
question,
first
of
administrative
law.
having
that
ruling
of
exemption,
can
the
commissioner
reverse
it?
even
though
he's
right
on
law.
mr.
ellsworth
c.
alvord
you
honor,
that's
--
mr.
ellsworth
c.
alvord
your
honor
you
--
you
will
recall
that
every
tax
law
imposes
upon
the
commissioner
where
the
approved
secretary
of
the
treasury
not
only
the
power
but
the
duty
to
prescribe
regulations.
mr.
ellsworth
c.
alvord
beginning
--
mr.
ellsworth
c.
alvord
that's
right.
if
we're
invalid
under
the
statute,
we'll
still
take
it
under
certain
circumstances.
that's
been
put
in
this
course
to
getting
with
the
reynold's
case
in
1939.
yes,
the
commissioner's
interpretation
of
regulation
is
wrong
but
if
it's
been
adopted
by
the
congress,
or
if
it's
been
long
standing,
you
accept,
we
say
we
don't
go
back.
this
regulation
has
been
enforced
ever
since
1918,
permitting
organizations
to
apply
for
exemption
and
more
specifically
in
1921
saying
that
if
they're
exempt,
they
need
not
file
corporate
tax
returns.
now,
i'm
very
happy
to
see
that
you
see
the
issue.
the
power
to
revoke
retroactive
--
mr.
ellsworth
c.
alvord
the
commissioner
exercised
the
power.
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
the
regulations
gave
them
the
power,
those
regulations
were
enforced
through
--
more
than
25
years.
i
think
i
would
express
some
doubt
as
to
the
effectiveness
of
the
regulations
to
compel
me
to
apply
for
a
ruling.
but
i
have
no
doubt
as
to
the
propriety
of
the
regulations
and
the
consequences
of
complaint
with
them,
if
i
do
follow
them
apply
to
get
a
ruling.
mr.
ellsworth
c.
alvord
that's
is
right
(voice
overlap).
that
is
right.
mr.
ellsworth
c.
alvord
that
is
correct
and
the
third
circuit
and
the
sixth
circuit
agree
with
you.
the
third
circuit
and
the
sixth
circuit
will
say
that
the
commissioner
has
no
power
to
revoke
this
specific
tax
luring,
granting
exemption
to
a
specific
organization
has
no
power
to
revoke
retroactively.
and
that's
what
we
want
this
court
to
do.
we
say
as
to
the
statute
of
limitations,
my
time
is
almost
up.
we
say
as
to
the
statute
of
limitations,
if
you
follow
the
balkan
insurance
company
case
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia,
and
if
you
follow
the
sandston
case,
decided
by
the
third
circuit,
you
will
find
that
that
regulation
relieved
of
--
relieved
us
of
a
duty
to
file
tax
returns
and
the
statute
of
limitations
which
says
that
tax
must
be
assessed
within
three
years
from
the
time
the
return
is
filed.
relieved
us
of
the
duty
to
file
a
return
on
the
statute
of
limitations
ran
from
the
due
date.
if
it
did,
the
statute
of
limitations
bars
the
commissioner's
action.
second,
we
say
as
to
the
satute
of
limitations,
we
filed
the
only
form
required
by
law
and
the
regulation
form
under
section
54
(f)
and
the
regulations
adopted
in
1942
applicable
to
1941,
form
990,
which
gives
all
the
facts
necessary
to
determine
an
income
tax.
but
i
concede
not
excess
from
this
tax.
we
comply
with
everything
required
of
this
and
we
see
that
form
990
is
the
return
within
the
meaning
of
section
2
--
275
(a)
and
is
the
return
within
276
(a)
and
the
statute
of
limitations
had
ran.
mr.
ellsworth
c.
alvord
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
indebted
to
counsel
before
the
government
in
his
very
clear
statement
of
the
case.
and
if
i
may
say
so
in
his
very
clear
statement
of
our
position,
i
will
take
up
to
rebuttal
in
the
order
in
which
he
has
discussed
the
issues
this
morning.
first,
he
says
various
power
to
revoke
retroactively.
mr.
justice
black
in
the
bench
yesterday
asked
me
how
a
commission
having
done
wrong
to
be
prevented
from
correcting
his
mistake.
i
interrupted
to
explain
and
i
think
the
counsel
for
the
government
had
done
a
better
job
than
i,
that
it
is
only
when
the
commissioner
is
wrong
that
the
doctrine
adopted
by
this
court
in
reynolds
has
any
conceivable
application.
if
the
commissioner
is
right,
we
don't
have
to
worry.
now,
i
respectfully
call
your
attention
to
the
second
stock
dividend
case,
united
states
against
(inaudible),
in
which
justice
jackson
gives
a
most
worded
exposition
of
the
power
to
revoke
retroactively
to
change
your
mind
retroactively.
and
fortunately,
he
also
gives
a
very
detailed
history
of
the
section
upon
which
the
government
relies,
section
3971
(b),
sustaining
power.
justice
jackson
says
specifically,
as
i
said
yesterday,
that
that
section
gives
no
power
to
revoke
retroactively.
the
power
must
first
exist
before
that
section
applies
and
the
power
in
this
case
just
as
in
length
does
not
exist.
i
think
i
need
to
discuss
those
cases
no
further
beyond
saying
that
in
our
opinion,
there
is
no
power
anywhere
found
in
the
statute,
in
the
regulations,
and
i
trust
in
practice,
under
which
the
commissioner
can
revoke
retroactively
in
this
case.
now,
counsel
for
the
government
makes
a
great
point
about
this
general
counsel's
memorandum
published
in
1943.
i
suspect
if
he
was
going
to
do
that,
then
for
your
convenience,
i
put
the
general
counsel's
memorandum
in
the
appendix
to
our
reply
brief.
if
you
should
read
it,
you
will
find
not
the
slightest
indication
of
the
revocation
of
the
ruling
in
--
in
individual
automobile
club
case,
you
will
find
not
the
slightest
indication
as
to
retroactive
revocation.
i
think
counsel
for
the
government
made
a
mistake
when
he
said
that
general
counsel's
memorandum
stated
in
1943
that
the
commissioner
could
go
back
at
anytime
to
1943.
his
argument
is
that
the
commissioner
by
reason
of
the
publication
of
that
gcm
could
any
grant
in
the
future
and
go
back
to
1943.
now,
the
counsel
for
the
government,
you'll
find
it
somewhat
from
the
record
yesterday
so
i
made
inquiry
of
the
record,
he
suggested
that
the
toy
automobile
club
had
notice
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
whether
the
members
was
on
the
board
or
if
it
took
place,
the
organization
to
which
their
gcm
applied
in
1943.
i'm
advised
that
they
received
no
notice
at
all
of
the
gcm
or
the
possible
application
of
the
revocation
of
any
ruling
that
we
somewhat
point
up
in
two
respects.
first,
and
we
quote
this
in
our
reply
brief,
“the
document
itself
in
which
their
gcm
is
published
says
to
the
world,
this
gcm
merely
evidences
the
trend
of
administrative
decision.
and
bear
in
mind,
it
is
only
an
opinion
from
the
general
counsel
of
the
bureau
to
the
commissioner.
and
any
number
of
instances,
day
in,
day
out
where
the
commissioner
does
not
follow
the
general
counsel.
second,
i
think
perhaps
you
have
at
least
accomplished
two
things
in
this
litigation.
in
1954,
the
commissioner
published
a
ruling
stating
that
from
now
on
general
counsel's
memorandum
published
in
his
bulletin
will
be
noticed.
there
is
nothing
prior
to
that.
and
as
this
court
knows,
the
only
publication,
which
gives
official
notice
is
a
better
register.
and
if
you
will
read
the
1954
revenue
ruling,
you
will
find
also
it
says,
i
think
the
commissioner
is
alarmed
by
this
case,
attempted
to
quiet
the
public.
he
says,
“it
is
the
specific
policy
of
the
bureau
except
in
extraordinary
cases
not
to
revoke
a
ruling
retroactively.”
now,
if
your
honors
please,
that
has
been
the
policy
of
the
bureau
for
years
and
years
and
years.
we
rely
on
that
policy.
taxpayers
rely
on
it.
practitioners
rely
on
it.
accountants
rely
on
it
and
the
commissioner
can
well
be
proud
of
that
policy.
mr.
ellsworth
c.
alvord
so
far
as
i
know,
your
honor,
in
this
automobile
club
case,
we
are
the
only
ones
whose
specific
ruling
was
revoked
retroactively.
there
is
no
--
in
the
litigation,
there
is
no
--
in
all
the
cases
that
have
been
fought.
there
has
been
no
retroactive
revocation.
we
challenged
the
commissioner
in
the
tax
court
to
produce
the
cases
in
which
he
hadn't
revoked
retroactively.
he
failed
to
do
so
and
he
has
not
done
so
yet,
a
several
hundred
automobile
cases
so
far
as
we
know.
we
are
the
only
one
in
which
there
has
been
a
retroactive
revocation.
mr.
ellsworth
c.
alvord
outside
the
automobile
clubs,
your
honor,
there
are
--
i'm
about
to
give
you
my
experience
now.
mr.
ellsworth
c.
alvord
well,
i
--
mr.
ellsworth
c.
alvord
i
--
i
did
your
honor.
and
i
must
give
you
my
experience
because
other
people
may
have
different
experience
and
i
had
quite
a
good
experience
in
this
field.
while
the
cases,
let
me
say
since
1939
and
since
reynolds,
it
is
the
established
policy
of
the
bureau
of
internal
revenue
so
far
as
i
know
never
to
revoke
a
ruling
retroactively.
we
actually
troubled
you
remember
back
in
the
days
of
senator
couzens,
i
won't
bring
you
to
that
case
because
it
has
a
lot
of
history.
but
as
soon
as
this
court
announced
r.j.reynolds
tobacco
company
case,
the
bureau
adopted
that
policy
and
adhered
to
it.
now,
let
me
point
out
that
in
reynolds,
there
was
a
retroactive
application
by
the
commissioner.
was
he
wrong?
yes,
because
he
enables
the
indictment.
just
a
year
ago,
you
said
that
the
regulation
involved
in
reynolds
was
correct
if
applied
prospectively.
it's
no
good
if
applied
retroactively.
mr.
ellsworth
c.
alvord
mr.
justice
burton,
we've
examined
the
record
in
all
occasions
where
we
can.
so
far
as
we
know,
every
case
in
which
a
specific
ruling
such
as
ours
was
obtained,
a
specific
notice
of
revocation
was
given
in
the
year
in
which
the
statute
was
to
be
applied.
now,
there's
practically
all
of
these
things
were
revoked
specifically
in
1943.
for
some
reason,
which
i
do
not
know,
we
and
maybe
others
haven't
found
yet
perhaps,
we
received
no
notice
until
1945.
mr.
ellsworth
c.
alvord
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
--
i
wasn't
representing
the
club
at
that
time
and
i
--
i
can't
answer
that
question.
i
--
i
can
answer
justice
harlan
by
--
i
think
by
saying
that
i
had
an
opportunity
to
argue
before
this
court
on
the
exemption
issue.
now,
that
--
i
could
have
convinced
this
court
to
become
more
exempt.
but
after
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
(inaudible)
in
which
we
have
to
apprehend.
so
that
it
isn't
quite
so
clear
that
this
is
merely
a
mistake
in
the
interpretation
of
the
statute.
now,
let
me
come
to
the
statute
of
limitations
very
briefly.
the
government
asked
you
to
disregard
the
decisions
of
the
tenth
circuit,
the
sixth
circuit,
the
second
circuit,
take
back
the
second
circuit
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia.
involving,
the
second
circuit
held
specifically
that
the
action
of
the
government
justified
that
they
need
a
file
to
return.
the
court
of
appeals
held
specifically
that
the
statement
of
a
revenue
agent
that
no
return
would
be
required
to
get
tax
purposes
where
sufficient
justification
for
no
gift
tax
return.
they
asked
you
to
disregard
those
decisions.
and
if
i
read
the
decision
correctly,
they
asked
you
to
overrule
the
germantown
trust.
after
all,
if
we're
going
to
be
accurate
on
this
thing,
germantown
trust
should
have
filed
a
corporation
return
but
they
didn't.
they
filed
a
petition
return
just
as
we
filed
the
990
as
required
first
by
the
regulations
in
1951
and
by
the
statute
in
1953
--
1941
to
1943.
if
balkan
is
right
and
if
the
court
of
appeals
of
district
of
columbia
is
right,
the
statute
of
limitations
run
from
the
due
date
on
which
the
return
was
supposed
to
be
filed.
if
germantown
is
the
one
to
follow,
then
the
statute
of
limitations
run
from
the
date
on
which
we
filed
the
form
990,
which
was
the
only
return
we
were
required
to
file.
and
i
will
take
the
counsel
for
government's
statement
where
the
decision
was
against
the
taxpayer
in
which
he
said
the
taxpayer
could
not
benefit
by
information
and
say
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
the
commissioner.
now,
let's
find
out
the
real
truth
of
this
thing.
it
is
my
humble
opinion
that
the
commissioner
just
failed
to
protect
the
government.
he
knew
of
germantown
trust,
decided,
i
think,
in
1939,
he
knew
of
--
both
the
insurance.
he
just
failed
to
protect
the
government.
now,
why
the
statute
of
limitations?
if
the
taxpayer
is
right,
the
statute
makes
no
difference.
the
statute
says
we
post
cases
right
or
wrong.
it
ends
it.
justice
black,
i
think,
will
remember
a
considerable
debate
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
back
in
1926,
where
senator
carter
glass
insisted
on
cutting
the
statute
from
five
years
to
three
years
and
he
was
joined
in
--
by
the
event
of
senator
black
in
order
to
settle
these
cases
sooner.
in
our
humble
opinion,
the
statute
of
limitation
is
wrong
and
the
second
circuit
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
this
court
in
germantown
were
right.
mr.
ellsworth
c.
alvord
as
i
stated
to
yesterday,
your
honor,
the
990
gives
adequate
information
for
income
tax
return.
an
excess
profits
tax
return
is
something
else.
again,
it's
an
exceedingly
complicated
return.
i
conceded
yesterday
that
there
was
not
enough
information
on
the
990
on
which
the
commissioner
could
compute
an
excess
profits
tax.
but
if
he
was
going
to
texas,
all
he
had
to
do
is
to
commend
early
enough
and
say,
“give
us
a
waiver”
or
commend
early
enough
and
say,
“i
want
more
information
with
respect
to
the
possibility
of
excess
profits
tax.”
i
call
your
attention
if
i
may
that
regulations
101
says,
“no
return
of
income
is
required.”
now,
i
come
to
the
matter
of
accounting.
i
want
to
clear
up
one
question
which
the
chief
justice
asked
yesterday.
the
issues
i
have
been
discussing
now
retroactive
revocation
and
statute
of
limitations
applied
only
to
1943
and
1944.
the
accounting
question
applies
all
the
way
through
from
1943
down
to
the
present
time
specifically.
the
government
realize
as
it
must
upon
the
decision
is
based
and
which
the
doctrine
of
claim
of
right
is
based.
the
government
counsel
failed
because
it
was
utterly
impossible
to
show
the
application
of
a
document
claim
of
right
to
any
case
in
which
there
was
an
established
method
of
accounting
of
longstanding
which
would
pick
the
particular
(inaudible)
in
question.
now,
he
says
our
commercial
accounting
method
is
no
good.
we
can't
rely
on
it
for
tax
purposes.
may
i
point
out
to
you
that
the
method
we
follow
is,
first,
the
method
followed
by
substantially
all
newspapers
of
this
country.
second,
the
method
followed
by
substantially
all
magazines
of
this
country.
and
if
you
then
have
any
doubt
about
it,
it
is
the
method
prescribed
by
the
civil
aeronautics
board
for
airlines.
there's
nothing
strange
or
unusual
about
this
system.
it
was
adopted
in
--
according
to
the
record
in
1934,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
adopted
10
years
before
that.
it
is
a
regularly
employed
system
of
accounting
adopted
with
no
tax
liabilities
involved.
the
cases
upon
which
the
government
relies
which
are
not
claim
of
right
cases
are
cases
where
the
taxpayer
attempted
to
change
the
system
of
a
government
for
some
tax
benefit.
there
is
no
tax
benefit
as
in
this
system.
now,
let
me
ask
one
question.
why
have
you
supposed
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
changed
the
method
of
accounting?
why
didn't
he
like
our
method?
certified
to
every
year
by
an
independent
certified
public
accountant.
the
answer
is
very
simple.
had
he
used
our
method?
there
wouldn't
have
been
practically
no
tax
due.
only
by
changing
that
method
could
he
impose
a
tax
upon
us.
now,
the
automobile
club
is
no
better
off
no
whistle
regardless
of
the
method
of
accounting.
and
i
venture
to
say
in
my
well-considered
opinion
that
if
i
were
to
take
the
balance
sheet
and
the
profit
law
statements
which
the
commissioner
required
in
this
case
to
a
bank
for
a
loan,
i
would
be
accused
of
misrepresenting
the
financial
position
of
the
automobile
property
tort.
it
doesn't
--
anywhere
as
near
represent
the
financial
standing.
now,
as
the
counsel
for
the
government
says,
“but
section
41
gives
the
commission
a
power.”
if
he
doesn't
like
your
system,
it
gives
him
power
to
adopt
a
new
one.
the
commissioner
has
been
controlled
in
this
matter
exactly
as
he
has
been
controlled
in
other
actions.his
system
must
be
better
than
the
taxpayer's
system
or
it
doesn't
take
it.
i
won't
read
but
i
will
tell
you
about
the
dissenting
opinion
of
judge
opper
in
the
tax
court
in
the
california
grape
products
case
which
is
one
of
the
three
cases
which
ratifies
and
endorses
this
principle
of
accounting.
he
was
writing
a
dissent
for
six
on
the
tax
court.
he
says,
“we
are
getting
much
too
careless
in
upsetting
taxpayer's
accounting
records.”
if
their
accounting
method
year
in
and
year
out
followed
consistently
consistent
--
consistently
even
though
in
one
particular
year,
it
may
be
some
strange
thing.
if
you
follow
it
consistently,
it's
good.
and
that
is
the
principle
which
the
courts
have
followed.
now,
government
counsel
in
this
respect
asks
you
to
overrule
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals.
all
three
of
those
courts
and
--
and
the
only
three
cases
that
gotten
up
so
far
to
the
court
of
appeals
as
far
as
i
know
on
this
--
on
this
issue.
every
one
of
us
went
against
the
commissioner.
now,
the
counsel
for
the
government
spends
a
little
time
on
legislative
history.
an
anticipation
of
that,
we
give
you
the
legislative
history
particularly
the
repeal
of
this
section
452
and
462.
in
that
repeal,
the
senate
finance
committee
said
specifically,
“we
like
the
beacon
publishing
company
rule.
we
like
the
california
grape
products
company
rule.
we
expected
the
commissioner
will
make
those
rules
generally
applicable
and
if
he
doesn't
and
if
the
courts
don't
correct
the
commissioner,
then
and
only
then,
if
i
may
differ
with
the
counsel
for
the
government,
then
and
only
then,
will
it
be
legislation.
now,
why
didn't
they
make
this
retroactive?
it's
always
difficult,
but
it
was
counsel
legislative
draftsman
for
many
years
and
counsel
in
the
treasury
for
many
years
in
legislation.
it's
always
difficult
to
know
when
to
make
things
retroactive.
there
are
group
of
cases
in
litigation.
congress
almost
invariably
adopts
the
policy
of
litigation.
let
them
point
it
out.
the
courts
can
work
it
out.
now,
in
conclusion,
i
would
say
that
a
victory
for
the
government
in
this
case
will
be
most
costly
as
a
matter
of
policy.
if
i,
the
tax
practitioner,
cannot
rely
on
the
rulings
of
the
treasury,
of
the
bureau,
then
i
know
the
treasury
as
other
taxpayers
and
practitioner
are
going
to
do
the
same
thing,
the
treasury
is
going
to
lose
money.
the
commissioner
is
going
to
be
embarrassed
because
the
taxpayers
will
have
lost
confidence
in
them.
who
knows
how
he
can
control
as
counsel
for
the
government
admitted.
if
you
want
to
scrap
the
power
to
revoke
in
instances
like
this,
you
can
go
back
to
everything.
there
is
no
stopping.
and
it
will
be
exceedingly
bad
for
taxpayers
because
as
justice
frankfurter
said
yesterday,
“the
system
is
terrifically
complicated.”
and
if
i
may
say,
it
is
getting
more
complicated
every
session
of
congress.
someone
has
to
take
the
burden
of
responsibility
of
giving
interpretations.
we
will
follow
them
as
far
as
we
can.
i
have
one
policy
in
my
office.
i
will
pay
every
penny
of
tax
the
taxpayer
owes
no
more
no
less.
now,
if
i
can't
rely
on
rulings
of
the
treasury,
what
am
i
going
to
do?
it
will
be
a
costly
decision
for
the
government.
and
furthermore,
if
i
understand
this
case,
it
will
mean
that
this
court
admits
that
there
is
no
control
over
the
actions
of
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue,
no
control
whatsoever.
i
have
never
seen
anything
so
arbitrary,
so
inexcusable
as
this
action
in
this
case.
now,
i
will
close
by
reading
your
statement
which
is
peculiarly
applicable
to
our
accounting
system.
and
to
the
policies
back
of
all
accounting
systems
for
tax
purposes
for
commercial
purposes.
there
was
philosopher
much
greater
than
i,
who
said,
“consistency,
thou
art
a
jewel.”
and
if
your
honors
please,
it
is
consistency
in
accounting
principles
upon
which
our
tax
system
rest
and
not
peculiarities.
and
this
accounting
system
has
been
followed
virtually
forever.
