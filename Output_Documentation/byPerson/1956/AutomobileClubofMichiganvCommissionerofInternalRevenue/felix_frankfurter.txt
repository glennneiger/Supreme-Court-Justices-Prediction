does
that
mean
--
are
you
merely
saying,
not
that
it
isn't
important,
are
you
saying
that
he
must
determine
whether
circumstances
bringing
in
with
the
category
which
congress
has
defined.
is
that
what
you're
saying
or
something
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this,
mr.
alvord.
as
i
understand
it,
this
regulation
granting
exemption
was
made
at
the
time
that
there
was
no
--
was
made
during
a
period,
during
which
there
was
no
court
construction
not
challenged
as
we
do
not
now
challenge.
there
was
no
court
construction
saying
that
as
one
construed
the
tax
laws,
this
is
not
within
the
permissive
category
of
an
exemption.
but
that
the
commissioner
construing
as
he
must
everyday
and
does,
the
law
before
the
courts
can
get
out
of
it,
but
before
there's
a
conflict
which
calls
for
a
construction
or
a
contest,
the
commissioner,
in
giving
his
construction
of
the
statute,
thought
this
exemption
was
within
the
terms
of
the
statute,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
if
that
had
continued
for
years
and
years,
and
the
first
time
it
came
up
here,
unless
it
were
one
of
those
egregious
regulation,
it
so
obviously
exceeded
the
speed
limit,
you
say
this
court
would
have
served
such
since
these
tax
measures
not
as
clear
as
crystal,
not
the
multiplication
table.
great
deference,
almost
conclusive
deference
is
shown
to
a
long
standing
administrative
interpretation.
and
indeed,
the
government
constantly
comes
in
and
argues
for
that.
and
therefore
you
say
that
you
can't
look
to
the
subsequent
declaration
of
illegality
that
during
the
period
that
it
was
construed
by
the
commissioner,
it
was
lawfully
construed.
is
that
what
this
is
about?
