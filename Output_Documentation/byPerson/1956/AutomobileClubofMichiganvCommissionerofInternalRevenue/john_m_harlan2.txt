does
the
commissioner
under
the
statute
have
power
to
make
retroactive
rulings?

putting
it
in
other
way
you
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
putting
another
way,
you
could
loose
on
your
point
what
mr.
alvord
did
one
on
his.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
vice
versa.
justice
john
m.
harlan
when
you
say
erroneous
ruling,
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
does
it
simply
mean
that
one
commissioner
took
a
different
view
than
the
other?
justice
john
m.
harlan
those
rulings,
i
suppose,
are
those
court
of
appeals'
opinions
all
came
down
after
the
new
ruling,
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
any
ruling
on
this
court
on
the
subject?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
was
a
characterization
that
you
would
--
you
can't
quite
say
that
it's
a
clear
cut
mistake
of
law.
it's
a
view
which
up
to
now
is
been
regarded
by
a
new
man
and
the
three
courts
of
appeals
as
being
the
right
ruling
or
as
the
other
one
was
erroneous
as
far
as
you
can
go.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
express
(inaudible)
of
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
should
mean
under
your
view
of
the
statute
that
you
could
go
back
to
1916
if
you
chose
to
and
collect
taxes
that
point
on.
justice
john
m.
harlan
those
statute
of
limitations
would
be
applicable.
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
statute.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
also
means
that
if
the
taxpayer
has
gotten
exemption,
erroneous
exemption
if
you
please,
in
order
to
protect
himself
on
the
statute
of
limitations,
he
notwithstanding
that
out,
codify
or
return
to
rehear
to
start
the
statute
run.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
it
would
have
done.
