mr.
jack
i.
levy
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
at
the
outset
to
refer
to
some
of
the
questions
that
were
asked
to
mr.
sprowl
during
the
course
of
his
argument.
the
first,
justice
frankfurter
asked
about
any
tendency
in
the
seventh
circuit
to
refer
cases
to
masters.
and
mr.
sprowl
made
reference
to
a
case
in
which
a
judge
said
that
there
was
some
practice
of
that
sort.
well,
that
case
is
krinsley
versus
united
artists
corporation.
it
was
decided
on
july
19th,
1956,
and
the
judge
who
made
that
statement
is
the
chief
judge
of
the
seventh
circuit
writing
for
a
unanimous
court.
and
what
he
said
was,
that
references
to
masters
are
a
practice
all
too
common
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
july
19th,
1956.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
yes,
sir.
it's
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
i
think
sir
that
the
remark
of
the
chief
judge
who
knows
the
situation
on
the
circuit
better
that
should
be
presumed,
they
know
it
better
than
anyone
else,
supplies
that
element
if
that
element
is
necessary,
but
i'm
prepared
to
demonstrate
that
that
element
is
not
necessary
in
order
to
invoke
mccullough.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
krinsley,
k-r-i-n-s-l-e-y
versus
united
artists.
secondly,
i
believe
that
justice
clark
asked
whether
any
other
antitrust
cases
have
been
referred
recently
in
that
circuit.
i
off
hand
can
think
of
four,
reivera
versus
eastman
kodak
company,
there's
krinsley
case,
the
meat
packers
case
which
was
brought
by
the
government
and
the
borden
case
which
was
also
brought
by
the
government.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
the
borden
case,
when
the
reference
was
made,
the
government
filed
a
petition
for
mandamus
in
this
court
to
revoke
the
reference.
it
was
filed
to
the
october
term
in
1952
and
immediately
upon
its
filing,
the
district
judge
who
had
referred
the
case
revoked
the
order
of
reference
so
that
the
matter
was
never
heard.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
krinsley.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
yes,
it
is.
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
krinsley,
yes,
sir.
the
question
was
asked
as
to
what
is
the
additional
expense
in
these
cases.
the
additional
expense
is,
first
of
all,
the
master's
fee
and
incidentally
i
know
that
the
master's
fee
in
the
krinsley
case
was
$30,000.
and
i
know
all
too
well
that
although
there
had
--
were
never
any
proceedings
before
the
master
in
this
case,
that
pursuant
to
the
order
that
he
had
the
right
to
require
the
posting
of
security
for
his
fees
and
the
parties
were
called
upon
to
post
cash
in
the
amount
of
$10,000.
neither
montgomery
ward
&
company
nor
howse
leather
company
posted
anything
because
of
our
objection
to
the
reference
and
i
don't
know
whether
any
of
the
other
parties
just
what
they
did
in
that
regard.
but
that's
not
the
only
additional
expense.
there
is
the
expense
of
the
court
reporter
which
is
extremely
substantial.
in
our
district
courts
in
chicago,
when
we
try
a
case,
we
have
the
services
of
the
official
reporter.
and
if
i
want
part
of
the
transcript,
i
order
what
i
want
and
i
pay
for
it,
but
that's
all
i
pay
for.
i
don't
pay
for
the
recorder's
time.
and
ordinarily,
in
chicago,
our
district
judges
don't
ask
for
a
transcript
of
all
of
the
testimony
at
the
trial,
and
if
they
do,
there
is
authority
to
the
effect
that
the
district
judge
has
a
right
to
ask
of
the
official
reporter
a
transcript
for
his
personal
use
without
any
additional
compensation.
in
this
case,
master
collin
made
it
very
clear
at
the
outset
that
it
would
be
his
reporter,
his
choice
of
reporter
who
would
take
the
--
the
case.
another
element
of
expense
is
the
expense
of
attorney's
fees
because
when
you
try
a
case
before
a
master,
you
try
it,
you
brief
it,
you
argue
it,
and
the
master
issues
his
report.
and
then
you
go
to
the
district
court
and
you
brief
it,
first
you
have
your
delousing
party
files
as
objections
to
the
report
and
you
brief
it
and
you
argue
it
and
you're
really
arguing
it
before
a
sort
of
intermediate
appellate
court
because
when
you
get
before
the
district
judge,
this
master's
findings
are
not
reversible
unless
they
are
clearly
erroneous.
and
that
was
the
very
point
of
the
two
appeals
in
krinsley
because
when
the
first
one
came
up,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“you
say
the
master
is
wrong,
but
you
don't
tell
us
exactly
how.”
and
then
when
it
came
up
the
second
time,
the
trial
judge
had
told
them
exactly
how.
so
that
there
are
these
additional
attorney's
fees
and
i,
in
this
case,
am
not
only
concerned
about
the
additional
attorney's
fees
that
will
be
chargeable
to
howes
leather
company
because
of
the
additional
work
that
i
do.
but
i'd
better
worry
about
the
additional
work
that
mr.
heisler
does
for
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
because
if
he
wins,
then,
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act,
he
is
going
to
recover
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
from
the
defendant
and,
of
course
they're
reasonable
most
of
the
fee
and
the
amount
will
depend
on
how
much
work
he
does.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
the
reporter's
fees
and
the
master's
fees
are
ordinarily
assessed
as
cost
against
the
losing
party.
of
course,
in
adventures
in
good
eating,
that
case
had
been
mentioned
when
that
went
up
on
appeal.
the
party
who
(inaudible)
the
reference
was
charged
with
the
cost
of
the
reference
even
though
he
had
won
the
case
for
the
course
here
all
parties
have
objected
to
their
reference.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
what
has
our
circuit
felt
about
fees,
our
--
our
circuit
expressed
itself
very
ably
and
succinctly
in
the
adventures
case.
and
they
said
litigants
are
entitled
to
a
trial
by
the
court
in
every
suit,
say
where
exceptional
circumstances
are
shown,
it
is
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
that
references
greatly
increase
the
cost
of
litigation
and
delay
and
postpone
the
end
of
litigation.
references
are
expensive
and
time
consuming.
the
delay
in
some
instances
is
unbelievably
long.
likewise,
the
increase
in
cost
is
heavy.
and
they
go
on
to
say
that
for
nearly
half
a
century
people
have
been
railing
against
this
thing
and
the
litigants
prefer
and
are
entitled
to
the
decision
of
the
judge
of
the
court
before
whom
the
suit
is
brought.
now
this
delay
is
not
inconsequential.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
adventures
in
good
eating
versus
best
places
to
eat
which
was
decided
by
the
seventh
circuit
in
1942,
it's
131
f.2d
809.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
and
it's
cited
in
the
brief.
this
delay,
mr.
sprowl
mentioned
that
if
we
had
been
before
the
master
we
would
evolve
then
round
up
by
this
time.
well
if
this
case
is
as
complicated
as
mr.
sprowl
makes
it
out
and
i
assure
you
that
it
is
not,
and
i
am
prepared
to
demonstrate,
then,
i
would
have
to
doubt
that
we
would
be
through
because
this
case,
as
mr.
sprowl
describes
it
is
far
more
complicated
than
the
krinsley
case
for
example,
and
you
might
be
interested
in
what
happened
there.
hearings
before
the
master
commenced
on
february
20th,
1952.
the
proofs
were
closed
on
december
4,
1952.
now,
someone
asked
about
continuous
hearings.
well,
there
were
exactly
22
days
in
that
period
of
nine
months
on
which
testimony
was
taken
in
the
krinsley
case.
the
master
filed
his
report
four
months
later,
april
21,1953
but
the
decree
of
the
trial
court
wasn't
entered
until
a
year
after
that,
march
17,
1954.
so
that
when
this
court
of
appeals
and
our
circuit
said
that
this
delay
is
serious
and
not
inconsequential,
they
knew
what
they
were
talking
about.
now,
there's
one
other
item
which
i
wanted
to
touch
on
before
i
go
to
the
other
points.
mr.
sprowl,
has
made
much
of
this
memorandum
in
which
the
defendants
describe
count
one
of
the
amended
complaint
as
fantastically
complicated
et
cetera.
i
was
one
of
the
signatories
to
that
brief.
that
brief
was
filed
in
support
of
a
motion
to
strike
count
one
of
the
amended
complaint.
this
was
a
long
time
ago
in
this
case.
judge
la
buy
struck
count
one
of
the
amended
complaint,
and
mind
you,
that
brief
was
only
filed
in
the
rohlfing
case,
not
in
the
shaffer
case.
and,
of
course,
here
judge
la
buy
referred
two
cases.
when
that
brief
was
filed,
there
were
25
defendants
in
the
rohlfing
case.
there
are
now
five,
there
were
six
at
the
time
the
reference
was
ordered
in
february,
1955.
since
then,
one
other
defendant
has
dropped
by
the
wayside
and
they
are
now
five.
and
i
had
great
--
i
would
subscribe
to
that
statement
today
if
rohlfing
had
25
defendants
and
were
in
its
original
posture,
but
that
wasn't
the
situation
when
this
case
was
referred.
and
i
don't
really
know
what
mr.
sprowl's
point
is.
he
illustrates
how
complicated
this
case
is.
certainly,
he
doesn't
mean
to
say
that
mr.
cowen,
who
is
just
a
practicing
lawyer
like
i,
he
doesn't
mean
to
say
that
he's
better
qualified
to
decide
this
case
with
this
judge
la
buy.
that
--
that
would
be
ridiculous
as
he
doesn't
have
the
training
and
he
doesn't
have
the
experience
that
judge
la
buy
has.
and
so
the
more
complicated
the
case,
i
think
perhaps,
that's
an
argument
for
keeping
it
before
the
judge.
and
that's
the
basis,
of
course,
for
the
difference
in
rule
53
(b)
with
respect
to
the
reference
of
jury
cases
where
the
issues
are
complicated
and
non-jury
cases
where
complexity
isn't
mentioned.
but
the
language
there
is
that
a
non-jury
action
and
rohlfing
and
shaffer
are
both
non-jury
actions.
it
shall
be
referred
only
upon
a
showing
of
some
exceptional
condition,
which
requires
the
reference.
and
there's
good
reason
for
that
difference.
juries
certainly
complicated
issues
frequently
are
--
will
escape
them
or
will
perhaps
be
dealt
--
better
dealt
with
if
the
case
is
referred.
now,
as
i
have
said,
these
cases,
rohlfing
and
shaffer,
which
are
private
antitrust
actions,
they
look
bad
when
you
look
at
the
complaints.
but
all
these
private
travel
damage
actions
today
look
bad
when
you
look
at
the
complaint.
the
complaint
isn't
any
--
isn't
a
reliable
estimate
of
the
complexity
of
the
case.
the
judicial
conference
said
that
in
the
cases
with
which
this
report
is
concerned,
and
they
weren't
concerned
with
rohlfing
and
shaffer,
they
were
concerned
with
cases
like
du
pont,
hartford-empire,
ferguson
versus
ford
motor,
alcoa.
now,
you
just
can't
talk
about
rohlfing
and
shaffer
in
the
same
breadth
with
those
cases.
in
cases
with
which
this
report
is
concerned,
complaints
and
charges
are
usually
couched
in
broad
terms
and
are
met
with
general
denials
or
demands
for
strict
proof
or
for
lack
of
information
under
the
views
of
the
function
of
pleadings
which
has
prevailed
in
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
the
complaint
and
answer
cannot,
in
most
cases,
of
the
type
now
under
discussion,
be
relied
upon
as
the
means
of
framing
the
issues
with
sufficient
(inaudible).
and
mr.
brackmann
calister
in
his
well-known
article
on
the
big
case
in
64
harvard
larry.
you
said
very
often
the
complaint
is
of
gragner.
the
issue
is
imposed
by
it
being
far
more
comprehensive
and
elusive
than
any
other
put
before
a
court.
of
course,
that's
precisely
the
case
here.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
sir.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
there
never
was
a
pretrial
conference
on
either
case.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
the
parties
hadn't
made
any
motion
for
pretrial
conference.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
no,
no.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
cases
are
quite
generally
as
a
regular
proposition
set
for
a
pretrial.
now,
these
cases
were
never
set.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
i
don't
--
i
can't
answer
that,
sir.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
in
that
case,
in
rohling
and
shaffer?
mr.
jack
i.
levy
yes
sir.
i'll
--
i'll
be
glad
to
do
that
right
now.
in
rohlfing
87
cobblers,
shoemakers
are
suing
for
travel
damages.
and
they
are
suing
five
defendants.
they
charged
conspiracy
to
restrain
trade
and
monopolize
commerce
trade
section
1
and
section
2
in
sherman.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor
and
as
i'll
care
to
demonstrate.
they
also
charged
violation
of
the
robinson-patman
act,
section
2
(a)
of
the
clayton
act.
now,
the
charges
made
here
that
they
also
charge
violation
of
section
3
of
robinson-patman.
i
don't
think
it's
worthwhile
taking
the
time
of
this
court
to
show
that
they
don't,
in
either
case.
but
if
they
do
charge
that
then
on
the
same
basis
which
would
support
that
statement
they
also
charge
violation
of
the
interlocking
bank
director
section
of
the
clayton
act
and
competitive
bidding
and
securities
dealings
as
they
mentioned
in
their
complaint,
those
sections
too.
now,
rohlfing
brought
by
this
87
shoemakers,
they
claimed
that
they
have
been
discriminated
against
in
the
sales
of
shoe
findings
as
contrasted
with
chains
or
with
large
buyers.
as
i
have
said,
there
are
five
defendants
in
that
case.
the
two
manufacturing
defendants
in
that
case
didn't
sell
anything
to
any
plaintiff.
judge
la
buy
acknowledged
that
and
that's
referred
to
in
our
brief.
so,
there
weren't
any
sales
by
them
to
any
of
these
plaintiffs.
two
of
these
defendants
are
allegedly
preferred
buyers,
the
people
who
got
the
break.
so,
they
didn't
sell
anything
to
any
of
these
plaintiffs.
and
the
remaining
defendant
in
rohlfing,
the
fifth
defendant
is
a
wholesaler
who
went
out
of
business
in
september
1950,
about
four
months
after
the
case
was
started,
and
it
appears
from
the
record
that
he
only
sold
to
two
of
the
plaintiffs.
so,
how
you
get
these
fantastic
bunch
or
mess
of
sales
that
will
have
to
be
probed
in
this
case,
i
fail
to
see
it.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
yes,
sir,
a
shoe
repairman.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
i
--
i've
read
the
complaint
many
times.
they
claim
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
to
monopolize
the
shoe
repair
trade
in
the
chicago
area.
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
to
restrain
them
in
their
trade.
it's
the
usual
general
sort
of
thing
that
--
mr.
jack
i.
levy
there
is
a
question
of
commerce
raised
by
some
of
the
--
mr.
jack
i.
levy
--
by
some
of
the
answers.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
yes.
some
of
the
--
mr.
jack
i.
levy
i
should
think
so
because
they're
confined
if
they
only
talk
in
terms
of
the
chicago
metropolitan
area.
and
i
think
the
facts
will
show
that
none
of
these
cobblers
ever
bought
anything
except
from
local
wholesalers
in
chicago,
who
didn't
do
business
anywhere
else.
of
course,
that's
--
remains
to
be
seen
whether
that
proof
will
show
them.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
correct.
correct,
that's
really
the
--
the
case.
but
nobody
left
in
this
rohlfing
case
ever
sold
to
any
plaintiff
except
one
defendant
and
that
defendant's
been
out
of
business
in
september,
1950.
and
the
record
shows
he
only
sold
to
two
of
--
of
the
87.
now,
in
the
other
case,
shaffer
by
--
and
no
one
can
possibly
claim
that
shaffer
is
--
is
fantastically
complicated.
shaffer
started
out,
there
were
10
wholesalers
in
the
chicago
area.
they
sued
a
number
of
companies
claiming
that
they
didn't
get
the
same
break
as
some
favored
that
wholesalers
got
or
even
some
retail
chain
defendants.
well,
there
again,
it's
true
it
was
a
--
there
were
a
lot
of
people
in
the
case
when
it
got
started.
but
today,
there
are
six
wholesalers
suing
five
defendants
two
are
leather
manufacturers.
one
makes
shoe
polish,
one
is
a
shoe
repair
chain,
and
the
other
is
a
wholesaler
who
went
out
of
business
from
september,
1950,
the
same
wholesaler.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
the
time
the
order
reference,
your
honor
in
--
now
there
are
five
defendants
in
each
case
at
the
time
of
the
order
of
reference.
there
was
one
other
defendant
in
each
case,
griffin
--
griffin
shoe
polish
--
griffin
shoe
polish.
there
again,
in
shaffer,
i
--
i
could
detail
what
the
sales
--
the
sales
of
the
defendants
but
there
again
there's
only
one
defendant
who
sold
to
five
of
the
present
plaintiffs.
these
cases
are
monumental,
there
--
we
see
cases
like
this
all
the
time
and
this
either
rohlfing
at
one
time
was
a
class
action.
we
got
rid
of
that.
there
were
200
--
i
believe
257
antitrust
cases
filed
in
the
--
in
the
federal
courts,
government
and
private
in
the
year
which
ended
june
30th,
1956.
well,
i
would
venture
to
say
that
most
of
those
cases
would
make
rohlfing
and
shaffer
in
its
present
posture
look
very
tame
indeed
as
they
are.
they
certainly
dealt
--
stand
in
the
class
with
du
pont,
which
mr.
sprowl
has
mentioned.
these
orders
of
reference
of
these
two
cases
were
entered
without
there
having
been
any
previous
mention
of
a
reference.
these
cases
have
been
in
this
court
for
several
years.
and
then
the
references
were
made.
and
they
were
made
over
the
objections
of
all
of
the
parties.
and
a
motion
made
by
all
of
the
parties
to
revoke
the
orders
of
reference
were
denied.
and
then
the
petitions
were
filed
with
the
court
of
appeals
for
a
writ
of
mandamus.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
the
rohlfing
case
had
come
on
for
a
trial,
your
honor.
and
the
plaintiffs
made
a
motion
for
a
continuance.
and
the
--
the
judge
referred
the
cases.
that's
not
the
first
time
that
case
had
been
up
for
up
for
a
trial,
however.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
by
the
plaintiffs?
mr.
jack
i.
levy
they
said
they
wanted
to
pursue
some
more
discovery.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
pursue
some
more
discovery.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
i
asked
for
a
trial
on
that
day
i
was
ready,
but
i
--
i
was
ready
for
a
trial
before
a
judge
not
before
a
master.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
oh,
yes
considerable
discovery,
very
extensive
discovery.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
oh
there,
i
--
i
agree
with
you
justice
frankfurter.
i
never
saw
any
--
i
didn't
see
any
reason
for
most
of
it
and
i
--
i
--
mr.
jack
i.
levy
no
i
--
well
i
agree
with
you
and
i
--
i
can't
answer
that.
i
can't
explain
it.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
i
objected
for
example
to
--
mr.
jack
i.
levy
oh,
yes.
yes.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
objections
to
interrogatories?
answer
the
interrogatories
and
so
on.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
no,
i
think
that
these
last
ones
were
dreamed
up
in
the
--
the
very
few
days
before
the
case
came
up
on
the
trial
court.
some
of
them
sounded
brand
new
to
me.
i
haven't
heard
of
them
before.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
no,
suggestion.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
oh,
yes.
there
was
only
one
reason
assigned
in
this
order
for
the
reference.
and
that
was
the
court
being
confronted
with
an
extremely
congested
(inaudible)
and
finding
that
exceptional
conditions
exists
for
this
reason
is
the
--
the
opinion
that
this
case
can
be
most
adequately
and
intelligently
presented
to
the
court
for
ultimate
disposition
by
reference
to
a
master.
when
judge
la
buy
filed
his
answer
to
the
petitions
for
mandamus,
he
expanded
that
somewhat
and
said
that
the
cases
were
very
complicated
and
complex
and
would
necessarily
take
considerable
time
to
try
and
that
his
calendar
was
congested
with
many
cases
long
delayed.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
he
hadn't
said
any
time
sir.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
oh
yes.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
but
he
--
he
told
us
that
there
--
that
he
wouldn't
--
he
want
to
refer
the
case
to
the
master.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
i
believe
he
said
not.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
yes.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
oh
no.
i
--
i
--
he
said
that
his
reason
was
the
--
the
congestion
of
his
calendar
as
he
stated
in
the
order
and
as
he
--
and
of
course
as
he
stated
in
the
answer.
now,
those
reasons
have
now
been
expanded
and
they
were
expanded
in
the
briefs
in
the
court
of
appeals.
there
that
the
cases
are
complicated
that
a
detailed
accounting
analysis
was
required.
i
don't
believe
that
he
means
to
say
this
is
a
matter
of
account
under
rule
53
(b)
which
would
--
is
one
of
the
exceptions
for
reference
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
i.
levy
the
date
of
the
order
of
reference
was
february
24,
1955.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
i
don't
--
mr.
jack
i.
levy
i
don't
know
whether
the
records
of
the
administrative
office
would
show
them
or
not.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
that
seems
so.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
judge
la
buy
in
his
answer
to
the
petitions
for
mandamus
said
that
the
cases
were
complicated.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
no,
sir.
there
was
no
reply
filed
to
his
answer,
but
at
the
time
that
he
was
--
mr.
jack
i.
levy
no,
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
no,
i
don't
believe
so
because
i
think
that
the
matter
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not,
the
writ
of
mandamus
should
have
issued
to
revoke
the
order
of
reference.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
yes
sir,
it
was.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
well,
yes.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
i
am
perfectly
willing
that
--
that
you
--
that
is
because
complicated
issues
are
not
a
ground
for
reference
to
the
jury
case,
and
of
course,
what
he
said
can't
change
the
actual
facts
of
the
case.
the
--
the
cases
are
whatever
they
are.
the
rule
53
(b)
which
is
--
mr.
sprowl
has
indicated
reflects
a
policy
that
is
obtained
ever
since
1912
in
equity
rule
59.
it
does
contain
very
strong
language
as
--
as
we
have
indicated.
it
seems
to
us
that
it
is
--
if
you
say
that
you
can
only
refer
a
non-jury
case
upon
a
showing
of
some
exceptional
condition
which
requires
the
reference
that
--
that
an
order
such
as
the
order
of
reference
entered
here
which
says
i
refer
these
cases
because
my
calendar
has
congested
cannot
stand,
because
there's
nothing
exceptional
about
congestion
of
the
calendar.
in
mr.
chandler's
last
report
for
the
fiscal
year
entered
july
30,
1956,
he
said
as
there
all
of
us
know
at
the
present
time
the
congestion
and
delay
in
the
civil
calendars
of
the
district
courts
are
so
much
the
most
serious
problem
in
the
administration
of
justice
that
in
this
report
i
consider
first
the
civil
business.
and
that
isn't
a
new
thing.
that
isn't
something
that
just
happened
in
the
last
fiscal
year,
because
as
he
points
out
there,
in
his
report,
that
1956
is
the
first
year
since
1951
in
which
the
district
courts
disposed
the
moore
cases
and
were
filed.
and,
of
course,
if
you
read
judge
la
buy's
answers
to
the
petitions
for
mandamus,
you'll
find
that
he
has
been
in
a
congested
state
for
at
least
six
years
prior
to
the
time
that
he
heard
du
pont
because
his
answer
sets
out
the
dates
when
he
heard
du
pont.
he
sets
out
these
other
so-called
big
cases
that
he
heard
prior
to
du
pont,
so
that
he
--
there
was
nothing
exceptional
about
this
with
him.
and
there's
nothing
exceptional
about
--
about
it
so
far
as
any
of
the
federal
courts
are
concerned.
we
all
know
their
--
their
problem.
but
in
the
--
but
the
significant
thing
is
that
no
one
in
all
this
talk
about
curing
congestion
suggests
that
we
cure
it
by
reference
of
cases
to
masters.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
recommendations
are
the
contrary.
they
reject
any
such
notion.
the
judicial
conferences
done
at
the
(inaudible)
report.
the
practice
and
procedure
committee
of
the
antitrust
section
the
american
bar
association
which
has
struggled
with
this
problem.
and
los
angeles
brush,
which
has
been
mentioned,
certainly,
didn't
hold
that
congestion
is
an
exceptional
condition
which
requires
a
reference.
all
that
they
said
there
was
that
we
are
not
inclining
to
hold
that
there
may
not
sometimes
be
such
a
congestion
in
the
docket
as
to
criminal
cases.
there's
nothing
said
here
about
judge
la
buy
sets
out
the
number
of
types
of
all
cases
that
he
has
but
there's
no
finding
here,
there
wasn't
james
but
there
were
criminal
cases
which
were
entitled
to
be
tried
first
if
there
was
any
congestion
in
the
criminal
docket
as
we
justify
a
district
judge
and
not
literally
comply.
and
in
mccullough
versus
cosgrave,
which
i
contend
is
the
case
which
held
that
congestion
plus
wasn't
enough.
because
in
that
case,
the
court
said
there's
congestion,
the
judge
to
whom
the
case
is
assigned
is
ill.
there
is
no
other
available
judge.
the
case
has
been
pending
a
long
time,
it's
complicated,
and
it
will
require
a
long
trial.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
that's
what
i'm
coming
to,
justice
frankfurter.
that
case
came
on
for
hearing
and
original
application
in
this
court
on
the
petition
and
upon
the
sworn
answer
of
judge
cosgrave.
and
that
was
not
disputed
according
to
the
record.
and
in
his
sworn
answer,
judge
cosgrave
denied
that
there
was
any
general
practice
to
refer
cases.
he
denied
that
there
was
any
general
practice
to
refer
patent
cases.
he
denied
that
there
was
any
discrimination
against
patent
litigants.
he
alleged
that
compulsory
references
were
very
exceptional
and
were
made
only
under
exceptional
conditions
and
that
there
was
no
deviation
for
patent
cases.
he
denied
the
maintenance
of
a
special
masters
court
from
the
time
of
james
oath.
and
he
pointed
out
that
there
had
been
12
compulsory
references
in
13
years
in
that
district
court.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
he
denied
that
they
could
maintained
that
special
masters
court
and
i
assume
that's
what
was
meant
by
standing
masters.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
and
that
there
had
been
12
compulsory
references
in
13
years
in
january
1,
1927
and
march
of
1940.three
of
those
were
mccullough.
there
were
three
cases
referred
in
mccullough.
and
in
seven
of
those
cases
where
there
were
compulsory
references
over
objection,
in
seven
of
them
they
were
pure
formal
objections
just
so
that
the
parties
wouldn't
be
bound
by
the
findings
of
the
master.
there
was
no
objection
on
the
ground,
there's
no
exceptional
condition
of
system.
so,
in
essence,
when
you
--
you
look
at
the
record
in
mccullough,
mccullough
isn't
any
different
from
our
case
except
that
the
showing
in
mccollough
was
stronger
in
the
order
of
reference.
the
showing
of
the
exceptional
condition
was
stronger
than
it
was
in
these
two
cases.
if
an
element
of
persistent
disregard
of
the
rules
is
necessary,
that
means
then,
of
course,
that
the
--
the
trial
judges
can
refer
cases
until
somebody
finally
decides
that
there's
a
persistent
disregard
of
the
rules.
i
think
if
the
chief
judge
of
the
seventh
circuit
is
to
be
believed,
i
think
that
element
has
been
supplied
by
this
statement
of
principal.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
he
says
a
practice.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
i
think
it's
significant
to
the
note
that
judge
cosgrave,
who
is
the
respondent
in
mccullough,
had
in
two
instances,
in
all
the
time
he
had
been
on
the
bench
which
at
that
time
was
ten
years,
had
made
two
compulsory
references,
had
made
in
--
in
only
two
instances
had
made
compulsory
references
over
objection
and
the
three
references
in
mccullough
were
one
of
those
instances.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
well,
judge
la
buy
says
in
his
answer
that
in
a
period
of
--
in
a
period
of
six
years,
he
referred
nine
matters
exclusive
of
the
two
cases
here
so
that
would
be
11
and
i
assume
--
mr.
jack
i.
levy
i
--
he
says
that
four
of
them
were
unlimited
matters
i
assume
that.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
limited
--
limited
matters
on
limited
issues.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
unlimited
issue.
i
don't
know
that
they
were
accounted
but
i
assume
those
figures
are
right.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
eight.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
all
of
the
judges.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
well,
oh
--
there
may
or
may
not
be.
in
other
words,
there
are
no
judges
who
just
try
criminal
cases.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
no,
sir.
each
judge
has
a
counter
and
he
takes
things
as
they
come.
cases
are
assigned
in
rotation.
civil
--
mr.
jack
i.
levy
it
might
be
very
well,
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
it's
rotation.
i'm
quite
sure,
judge
--
justice
clark.
you
never
know
when
you
file
your
case
what
judge
--
the
judge's
name
whom
it'd
be
assigned
but
it's
a
--
it
is
a
rotation
process
--
mr.
jack
i.
levy
--
so
that
there's
a
more
or
less
even
numerical
distribution.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
no,
sir.
we
have
no
motion
judge.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
yes,
sir.
he
may
not
ultimately
try
the
case.
there
are
instances
where
cases
are
transferred
by
the
executive
committee
of
the
court.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
suggested
to
judge
la
buy
in
a
--
the
time
i
--
we
were
objecting
these
references
that
he
considered
asking
the
senior
judge
of
the
northern
district
judge
barns
to
consider
reassignment
of
this
case
to
another
judge.
i
said
that
perhaps,
if
it
were
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
chief
judge
of
the
seventh
circuit,
he
might
get
a
retired
judge
or
some
other
judge
from
within
or
without
the
circuit
to
hear
the
case.
those
suggestions
were
summarily
rejected.
and,
of
course,
it
isn't
just
a
question
of
what
is
judge
la
buy's
situation.
these
cases
are
pending
in
the
district
court.
we
want
a
trial
by
a
federal
judge,
not
necessarily
judge
la
buy.
and
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
order
to
judge
la
buy
to
try
these
cases.
the
court
of
appeals
said
they
shall
be
tried
by
the
district
court
just
what
your
honor
said
or
what
this
court
said
in
--
in
mccullough.
it's
not
--
this
is
not
a
--
a
personal
matter,
as
far
as
judge
la
buy
is
concerned.
this
is
a
--
a
--
we
--
we
are
convinced
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
rules
and
that
we're
entitled
to
a
trial
by
a
federal
judge.
his
own
particular
calendar,
what
difference
does
that
make?
it's
a
--
a
question
of
what
is
the
situation
in
the
district.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
yes,
but
there
are
the
cases
are
as
mr.
sprowl
told
your
honors,
yesterday,
there
are
instances
when
cases
are
turned
over.
for
example,
when
judge
la
buy
had
du
pont,
other
judges
helped
out.
there
is
no
--
nothing
ironclad
it.
there's
nothing
wrong
with
transferring
cases.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
i
recall
it,
the
shaffer
case
was
not
originally
assigned
to
judge
la
buy.
and
i
don't
recall
just
how
it
did
happen
to
get
there.
i
think
when
they
appointed
some
new
judges,
some
of
these
cases
were
shuffled
around.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
oh,
no.
they
--
they
have
in
the
district
court,
i
--
i
believe,
this
is
accurate.
they
have
what
they
call
the
executive
committee.
they
speak
about
transferring
a
case
to
the
executive
committee
for
reassignment.
and
i
don't
think
it's
just
the
senior
judge.
i'm
not
quite
sure
just
how
that
works
but
they
handle
the
administration
with
the
courts.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
yes.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
that
he's
on
vacation
or
something
like
that
then
you
will
go
and
report
to
some
other
judge
who'll
be
hearing
that
judge's
motions.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
no,
sir.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
no,
sir.
if
i
wish
to
--
mr.
jack
i.
levy
yes,
sir.
if
i
were
to
make
a
motion
on
the
rohlfing
case,
i
would
decide
what
day
i
wanted
to
make
the
motion.
i
would
serve
notice
that
i
would
appear
before
judge
la
buy
on
that
date.
and
i
would
be
there
and
i
would
hand
the
motion
slip
to
his
clerk
and
his
clerk
would
collate
and
i
would
present
the
motion.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
an
original
proceeding
like
that,
i
would
go
--
mr.
jack
i.
levy
--
i
would
go
if
--
mr.
jack
i.
levy
--
there
were
no
pending
case,
i
would
go
to
the
--
mr.
jack
i.
levy
yes.
i
would
go
into
the
clerk's
office
and
the
clerk
would
tell
me
where
to
go.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
that
would
be
on
the
basis
of
his
rotation
system,
very
likely.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
but
that's
how
i
would
do
it.
i
would
do
--
mr.
jack
i.
levy
no,
sir.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
the
petitioner
in
this
case
denies
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
the
power
to
mandamus.
he
says
right
or
wrong.
of
course,
if
that
is
true,
then
rule
53
(b)
is
what
the
seventh
circuit
said
in
the
irving-austin
case,
a
mere
academic
pronouncement.
however,
this
court
will
note
that
there
is
no
question
about
the
statutory
authority
of
the
court
of
appeals.
it
has
the
same
statutory
authority
as
this
court
has
because
it's
under
rule
1651
(a).
and
i
think
as
has
been
delineated
on
our
brief,
precisely
the
same
power
that
this
court
had
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
all
writs
act
in
1948.
in
ex
parte
peru,
all
the
members
of
the
court,
including
the
dissenting
justices
agreed
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
the
same
power
as
the
supreme
court.
the
--
the
reason
that
the
supreme
court
act
is
there
in
the
view
of
the
majority
was
because
there
were
unusual
circumstances
which
justified
the
--
this
court
in
acting
on
the
original
application.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
i
certainly
am,
sir.
and
judge
magruder
in
the
josephson
case,
in
dealing
with
an
application
for
mandamus
to
revoke
an
order
transferring
a
--a
case
from
judge
wyzanski's
calendar
to
the
federal
court
in
the
southwest,
said
that
the
cases
that
this
court
decided
before
1948,
before
the
passage
of
the
all
writs
act,
were
not
authority
for
issuance
of
mandamus
by
a
court
of
appeals.
i
respectfully
suggest
that
judge
magruder
is
wrong
because
you
can't
read
cases
like
peru
or
roche
and
without
seeing
that
this
court
has
said
on
more
than
one
occasion,
that
its
power
to
issue
mandamus
under
what
was
originally
section
13
of
the
judiciary
act
of
1789
was
confined
constitutionally
to
those
instances
in
which
the
writ
was
in
aid
of
its
appellate
jurisdiction.
but
getting
the
original
jurisdiction
to
promote
as
the
original
jurisdiction
would
have
no
application
here.
it
has
defined
the
power
of
the
court
of
appeals
under
what
was
section
14
of
that
judiciary
act
as
precisely
the
same
--
precisely
the
same.
and
there
are
those
cases
where
this
court
said,
we
won't
issue
the
writ
of
mandamus
to
the
district
court
on
original
application
because
there
are
no
unusual
circumstances
which
should
make
us
take
jurisdiction,
take
the
case.
but
go
to
the
court
of
appeals,
that's
where
you
belong.
that's
really
what
i
think
they
said
in
james.
and
in
mccullough
versus
cosgrave,
that
persistent
disregard
of
the
rules
or
this
policy
which
justice
frankfurter
speaks,
that
could
very
well
be
the
reason
for
this
court's
entertaining
the
original
application.
james
was
merely
cited
to
the
court
in
that
case
in
the
petition
for
mandamus
as
authority
for
the
power.
that
was
the
only
mention
made.
i
don't
mean
that
this
court
makes
its
own
investigation
of
the
law.
but
i
think
that
fact
is
significant.
as
i
have
said,
the
all
writs
act
changed
nothing.
petitioner
argues
that
it
did.
well,
petitioner
must
argue
that,
as
judge
magruder
must
argue
that,
in
the
josephson
case
because
that
is
vital
if
he
is
to
get
rid
of
the
authority
as
mccullough.
but
the
fact
is
that
the
powers
were
the
same,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
1651
(a)
was
enacted,
the
revisers
notes
tell
us
that
these
former
statutes,
one
of
which
dealt
with
the
supreme
court's
power
to
mandamus,
and
one
of
which
dealt
with
the
supreme
court
and
all
other
courts'
power
to
issue
extraordinary
writs,
they
were
eliminated
as
unnecessary.
now
if
they
were
unnecessary
and
certainly
the
old
section
13,
which
became
section
342
couldn't
have
given
this
court
some
power
that
it
doesn't
have
under
the
present
statute,
which
applies
to
all
courts
alike.
i
want
to
call
this
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
there
is
no
remedy
by
appeal
in
this
case.
in
par,
granted
that
it
was
a
--
a
rough
remedy,
perhaps,
because
he
could
have
a
very
unpleasant
experience
in
the
mean
time,
but
this
court
was
very
careful
to
point
out
that
he
did
have
a
remedy
on
appeal.
in
bankers
life,
it
was
conceded
that
there
was
a
remedy
on
appeal.
in
roche,
there
was
a
remedy
on
appeal.
in
roberts,
the
case
of
the
indigent
prisoner,
he
had
--
he
could
start
over
again.
he
had
some
other
remedy.
but
here,
there
isn't
any
remedy.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
i
understand
that,
sir.
but
whether
or
not,
there
is
a
remedy
by
appeal,
is
a
factor
which
this
court
and
other
courts
take
into
consideration
in
determining
whether
in
their
sound
discretion,
they
will
issue
the
extraordinary
writ
of
mandamus.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
and
that's
--
mr.
jack
i.
levy
i
think
there's
no
question
about
that,
sir
--
mr.
jack
i.
levy
--
by
reason
of
the
statute
--
mr.
jack
i.
levy
--
the
all
writs
act.
and
that's
precisely
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
done
here.
they
have,
in
their
sound
discretion,
issued
mandamus.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
no,
sir.
i
mean
this.
that
on
final
review,
these
parties
who
have
objected
to
the
reference
and
they
would,
of
course,
be
the
losing
party,
won't
be
able
to
say,
this
case
should
be
reversed
because
it
shouldn't
have
been
tried
by
a
master.
furthermore
where
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
i.
levy
adventures
in
good
eating
holds
that
in
our
circuit.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
i
can
only
say
to
your
honor,
that
the
two
cases
in
which
it
was
raised.
i
--
i
can
point
to
two
cases.
they're
cited
in
our
brief
and
--
and
really
three
cases,
where
on
final
appeal,
the
appellate
court
condemned
the
references
but
did
not
reverse.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
that
wasn't
only
our
circuit.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
in
these
cases
to
which
i
refer
and
which
appear
in
our
brief
and
which
were
not
just
seventh
circuit
cases,
the
point
currently
was
made
and
preserved
below,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
well,
the
only
circuit
i
know
like
that,
and
there
i
would
confine
it
to
the
limited
situation
before
judge
magruder,
is
the
first
circuit.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
the
third
circuit
mandamus
to
revoke
a
reference
in
united
states
versus
kirkpatrick,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
that
was
the
case
that
mr.
sprowl
mentioned.
that
was
the
third
circuit.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
that
was
a
transfer
case.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
yes.
there
is
that
case
but
the
square
case
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned
is
united
states
versus
kirkpatrick
in
the
third
circuit.
and
in
the
adventures
in
good
eating,
for
example,
they
said
the
--
the
reference
was
wrong
and,
therefore,
will
lay
the
cost
on
the
plaintiff
who
asked
for
the
reference,
even
though
he
won
the
case.
but
of
course,
here,
everyone
is
subjected
to
reference.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
sir?
mr.
jack
i.
levy
i
don't
know.
i'm
hoping
it
won't
be
me.[laughter]
there
has
been
a
--
a
lot
said
here
about
this
case
is
going
to
end
references.
this
case
won't
end
references.
this
is
--
this
case
shouldn't
end
references,
it
can't.
i
don't
think
this
case
has
done
anything
that
we
didn't
know
before.
and
there
are
still
going
to
be
cases
referred,
jury
cases
where
the
issues
are
complicated.
there
will
be
not
--
there
will
be
merits
of
account
referred,
there
will
be
non-jury
actions
referred,
where
exceptional
conditions
required
a
reference.
and,
of
course,
there'll
be
any
number
of
cases
referred
where
the
parties
agree
to
the
reference
or
where
they
don't
object.
this
will
not
--
this
decision
does
not
hamper
the
courts
--
it
doesn't
hamper
the
court.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
no,
sir.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
i
think
--
mr.
jack
i.
levy
well,
i
don't
think
this
court,
in
the
first
place,
would
ever
entertain
a
writ
unless
there
were
some
very
important
question
on
a
--
on
a
national
basis.
mr.
jack
i.
levy
well,
i
don't
think
--
well
(inaudible)
which
is
the
case
in
the
first
circuit
which
wouldn't
revoke
the
reference.
the
reference
was
100%
right
in
that
case.
there,
they
had
eight
jury
cases
consolidated
for
trial.
they
were
(inaudible)
broad
cases
where
the
defendants
counterclaim
for
travel
damages
on
the
antitrust
laws,
complicated
indeed,
jury
cases.
and
the
rule
says
where
the
issues
are
complicated,
you
can
refer
only
where
the
issues
are
complicated.
well,
they
were
complicated
and
that's
what
the
district
judge
said
and
he
referred.
and
then
there
was
a
petition
for
writ
of
mandamus
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
they
didn't
say
they
didn't
have
the
power.
they
said
they
didn't
want
to
go
into
anticipatory
review.
