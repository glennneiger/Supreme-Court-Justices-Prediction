justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
sees
the
case
through?
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
there
been
a
defendant
case
in
your
circuit?
the
district
--
the
district
court
has
made
reference
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
without
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
insisted
this.
is
there
any
suggestion
with
the
--
they
compare
to
the
situation
brought
to
the
terms
of
the
reference
in
that
sense?
justice
felix
frankfurter
definitely,
the
proceedings
before
the
master
would
be
more
than
or
would
be
drawn
out
to
congress
if
files
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
like
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question.
may
i,
mr.
sprowl?
the
question
of
fees
as
the
--
as
the
amount
of
the
fee
allows
the
master
and
referees
(inaudible)
subject
to
the
of
controversy
before
the
court
of
appeals
have
alleged
that
the
abuse
of
excessive
fees
turned
off
the
decision
for
the
district
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
(inaudible)
in
regards
to
him
or
any
other
judge.
i
want
to
know
of
the
circuit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
this
isn't
just
one
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
jennings
case
--
the
jennings
decision
where
they
rested
on
non-desirable
tenets
not
by
the
court
as
the
court's
focus
it's
really
considered
as
the
case,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
put
these
in
place
now,
rather
(inaudible)
you
know
the
ones
standing
by.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
there
any
--
are
there
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
wondered,
because
if
there
are
standing
masters,
then
i
think
that
--
that
to
me
is
wrong
to
employ
on
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
my
recollection
they
are
used
in
new
york
with
southern
district
of
new
york.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
means
there
rather
are
profession
on
judiciary
is
rather
hostile
to
what
seems
to
me
is
the
standard
(inaudible)
this
takes
care
of
the
reference
question
and
those
having
received
questions
but
that
is
not,
as
i
understand
it,
the
position
or
the
attitude
on
part
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
when
they
come
in
on
(inaudible)
once
more.
that
i'm
refreshing
my
recollection.
i
remember
the
mccullough
case
and
i
think
the
reference
to
the
--
to
the
brief
samples
cited
and
filed
and
(inaudible)
as
i
remember
that
case,
where
just
like
the
james
case,
it's
not
words,
namely,
there
is
a
standing
order
to
refer
all
type
of
cases
to
a
master
because
there
was
congestion
in
the
district.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
that's
a
very
--
and
that
--
that
was
precisely
what
was
condemned
in
the
james
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
the
judges
had
been
put
conscious,
leaving
there
too
much
to
do,
they
will
refer
all
patent
cases
to
a
master,
and
would
copy
the
next
order
(inaudible)
to
make
something
ordinary
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
that's
the
order
of
the
condition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
the
reason
we
disposed
of
the
(inaudible)
by
referring
to
the
james
case
is
because
the
james
case
fitted
it
like
a
glove,
it
was
packed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
didn't
answer
to
the
judiciary,
congress
for
one
reason
or
the
other,
where
there
is
sovereign
of
rights,
didn't
make
the
addition
to
the
judiciary
out
of
california
had
been
requested
to
go
judges
said,
“we'll
dispose
of
it
this
way.”
and
the
rule
is
against
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
court
says,
they
can't
do
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that
was
the
case,
that
there
is
no
--
that
was
a
criminal
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
be
non-exercise
of
mandamus
made
a
man
to
have
to
stand
a
trial
and
conviction,
all
the
rest
of
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
convenience
merely
to
determine
the
exercise
of
mandamus.
you
have
it
there
and
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
was
that
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
a
reference
to
that
such?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
--
i
--
in
this
case,
are
you
prepared
to
say
that
there
is
a
systematic
or
continuous
practice
comparable
to
the
gain
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
name
of
that
case,
krinsley?
justice

is
it
in
your
brief,
respondent's
brief?
justice
felix

(inaudible)
krinsley.
justice

did
you
see
the
plaintiff
--
do
you
say
the

will
just
ordinary

justice

you
mean
people
(inaudible)

justice

now,
what
was
the

in

to

the

any

how
was
it
raised?(voice

--
justice

you
may
be

if
you
came
with
(inaudible)
justice

--
but
that
issue
to
that
brief
for
the
master,
of

a
raise
in
the

or
radiation?
justice

what
were
the
grounds
for
continuing

which
it
continue
throughout?
justice

yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice

did
you
ask
for
any
trial?
justice

had
there
been
a

in

already?
justice

what

this
occasionally

what
you
indicated,
what
was

about?

(inaudible)

if
(inaudible)
the
--
the

was

was
directed

appropriate
motion?
justice

i
know.
was
that
passed
on
by
the
judge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
was
a
private
issue
when
we
passed
on?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
good
many
of
them
were
all
standing
still
and
they
wanted
some
more?
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
suggestion
of
reference
was
spontaneously
made
by
the
judge
is
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
to
the
plaintiff.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
were
in
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
levy,
may
i
(inaudible)
to
tell
me
what's
the
date
of
the
order
of
reference
was?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
it
be
easy
that's
even
directed
here,
the
administrative
law
doesn't
show
on
what
judicial
business
judge
la
buy
was
engaged
in
the
six
months
following?
what
kind
of
case
did
he
try?
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
judicial
business?
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
if
he
got
and
referred
to
the
office
if
it's
the
northern
district.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
this,
the
answer
from
the
judge
was
after
the
petition
of
mandamus
by
the
court
of
appeals,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
the
matter
came
to
the
court
of
appeals
was
a
(inaudible)
on
the
basis
of
which
petition
for
mandamus.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
could
justify
on
whatever
way
he
could
justify.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
had
a
systematic
practice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
had
a
standing
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
see
how
you
could
say
that
--
that
remark.
in
the
first
place,
he
doesn't
say
judge
la
buy
went
under
your
(inaudible)
because
of
the
tendency.
he
may
make
think
you
ought
to
have
no
reference
of
how
you
can
say
that
that
is
comparable
to
the
james
situation
or
on
the
assumption
that
is
going
through
the
same
and
the
way
we
act
as
the
cosgrave
case
--
case
that
we
have
because
he
says
there's
a
tendency.
i
might
be
your
(inaudible)
in
the
record,
which
i
can
understand.
how
you
can
present
not
just
to
say
that
this
is
a
finding
that
there
was
a
persistence.
i'm
not
suggesting
that,
that
alone
is
enough
because
it's
true
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
goes
to
next
order
of
decision.
but
i
think
if
persistence.
i
haven't
a
standing
way
of
doing
it
satisfied.
that
it
can't
be
extraordinary
but
it's
always
done.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i've
got
the
exact
words
here.
all
your
practice
(inaudible)
district
of
illinois.
now,
i
don't
know,
maybe
judge
la
buy
is
exceptional.
how
you
can
therefore
say
that
this
particular
thing
demonstrates
an
absence
of
those
unusual
circumstances,
i
don't
quite
see.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
know
how
many
references
judge
la
buy
made
over
a
period
of
years
in
view
of
mr.
sprowl's
decision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
were
miscellaneous
cases
and
one
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
what
matters?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
unaccounted
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
--
how
many
just
(inaudible)
of
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
eight.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
tell
us
what
the
system
is
about
trying
criminal
cases,
do
the
--
do
they
--
how
many
accept
the
criminal
cases
is
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
all
the
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
the
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
the
eight
criminal
trials
are
going
on
today?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
just
the
criminal
--
criminal
statutes
set
aside
in
which
judges
a
or
b
presides
for
two
months.
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
--
you
don't
mix
up
civil
and
criminal
cases.
that
doesn't
try
a
criminal
case
to
set
us
up
if
there
was
any
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right
then.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
is
true,
isn't
it
true,
that
a
judge
keeps
a
case
and
the
motion,
as
he
is
--
an
interlocutory
motion.
is
that
a
motion
calendar
up
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
does
that
continue
to
--
is
it
the
fact
that
there
--
you
have
it
on
a
regular
day
when
somebody
makes
a
motion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
motion
has
to
be
made,
it's
made
before
the
judge
who
has
that
case,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
you
have
a
new
--
suppose
there's
just
--
it
is
--
to
satisfy
my
curiosity
(inaudible)
motion,
suppose
you
want
to
enjoin
from
that
from
your
safe
court
before
whom
do
you
go,
anybody
you
wanted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
pending
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
how
would
he
determine
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
on
regular
motion
counter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
--
you're
familiar
with
the
fact
that
judgment
was
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
doesn't
follow
because
there's
no
remedy
from
an
interlocutory
order,
that
an
appeal
is
allowed
by
an
act
of
congress.
that's
not
a
logical
conclusion.
that's
merely
an
exercise
by
congress
in
determining
what
is
and
wasn't
appealable
by
a
specific
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
they
have,
before
you
exercise
sound
discretion,
you
must
have
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
not
--
why
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i'm
not
talking
about
your
circuit.
but
why
not?
if
a
reference
was
made
beyond
the
power
of
the
court,
any
result
from
that
reference
is
something
you
haven't
and
that's
contendedly
determined,
too.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
your
--
in
your
circuit,
they
profess
to
have
power
to
review
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore
--
therefore,
if
no
question
was
made
as
to
the
reference
when,
at
the
time
it
was
made,
of
course,
you
can't
ask
for
a
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
--
was
it
that
these
cases
arise
in
circuit
things
which
denied
the
power
to
review
the
order
of
reference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
the
third?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
the
earlier
cases
do
they
uphold
third
circuit
should
have
sat
en
banc
and
pointed
out
the
difficulties
of
this
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
a
transfer
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
your
view
that
in
each
case
the
court
of
appeals
is
not
what
is
for,
must
pass
on
the
specific
circumstances
in
a
particular
case
an
ex
parte
judgment
under
the
conditions
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
could
you
avoid
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
unless
you
got
the
same
situation,
it's
just
a
matter
of
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
here
there
was
a
company
to
abuse
the
circuit
on
the
mandate
which
is
important?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
are
you
reading
from?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
sprowl,
i
have
mentioned
(inaudible)
by
one
of
my
brothers
to
do
--
to
document
this
case
--
to
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
of
the
(inaudible)
on
page
30,
beginning
page
30
of
the
record,
am
i
right
in
the
finding
defining
that
the
27
pages
thereafter,
those
are
all
the
documentaries
in
this
case
prior
to
reaching
the
present
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
kind
of
--
what
kind
of
proceedings
were
those?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
--
i
thought
that
within
the
reference
and
the
objection
to
it
stopped
from
using?
but
what
was
it?
what
happened
thereafter?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
is
general
defense
and
is
alive.
i
suppose
you
he
could
write
a
whole
book
on
this
single
exhibit.
