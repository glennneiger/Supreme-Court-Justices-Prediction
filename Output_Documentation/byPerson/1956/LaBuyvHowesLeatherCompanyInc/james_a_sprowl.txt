mr.
james
a.
sprowl
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
excuse
me.
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
in
this
case,
i
represent
judge
walter
la
buy,
one
of
the
district
judges
in
chicago.
this
proceeding,
which
is
a
review
of
two
writs
of
mandamus
issued
against
judge
la
buy
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit,
over
his
entering
of
orders
in
these
two
companion
cases
referring
them
generally
to
a
master
for
hearing.
i
--
in
many
of
these
mandamus
cases
involving
an
interlocutory
order
of
some
sort,
the
attorney
representing
the
judge
is
involved
in
the
litigations
that
underlie
the
mandamus
suits,
but
that
doesn't
happen
to
this
so.
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
antitrust
suits
that
were
referred
to
the
master
but
was
asked
by
the
judge
to
be
his
counsel
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
this
court.
therefore,
my
knowledge
of
the
underlying
litigation
is
derived
from
the
record
which
is
quite
full
and
the
published
opinions
on
interlocutory
rulings
of
judge
la
buy
as
they
have
appeared
in
the
federal
rule
decisions.
i
think
this
case
is
a
considerable
importance
in
the
administration
of
justice
in
the
district
courts.
judge
la
buy
had
the
luck
to
be
the
judge
to
try
the
du
pont
case,
united
states
against
du
pont,
that
is
now
before
this
court
on
review.
that
trial
occupied
him
from
november
18th,
1952,
until
december
21st,
1953,
a
period
of
one
year
during
which
merely
the
hearing
of
the
testimony
and
possibly
the
arguments
in
court,
the
court
time
took
101
trial
days
or
substantially
three
quarters
of
the
entire
year
of
the
court.
after
that,
of
course,
he
had
to
digest
that
record
and
write
his
opinion.
all
of
that
was
very
unusual
and
put
the
judge
behind
in
his
particular
docket.
in
chicago,
they
assigned
the
cases
purely
by
luck
and
i
think
there
are
eight
judges
and
every
eight
case
goes
to
one
of
the
judges.
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
and
he
sees
the
case
through
and
never
reassigned
it
except
of
--
or
there
might
be
if
--
if
one
judge
had
time,
they
might
reassign
a
case
or
if
--
if
a
case
is
related
to
a
case
pending
before
another
judge,
they
consolidate
them
before
the
lowest
number.
and
judge
la
buy,
although
this
isn't
in
the
record,
got
some
relief.
i
know
he
did
because
of
the
appointment
of
new
judges
and
he
was
able
to
reassign
some
cases
to
those
new
judges.
nevertheless,
he
was
left
in
a
very
difficult
position.
now,
then,
another
thing
had
happened
to
judge
la
buy,
now
--
that
--
that
case
of
the
--
the
actual
trial
of
the
case
ended
one
year
before
these
references.
with
his
opinion,
i
don't
think
it
--
that
this
record
shows
it
was
considerably
later
and
the
year
between
the
end
of
the
trial
was
occupied
largely
in
consideration
of
that
case
that
isn't
the
deal
of
time.
now,
in
this
case,
or
these
two
cases,
involved
the
shoe
repair
trade
in
chicago.
the
petitions
for
mandamus,
i
might
say,
set
forth
nothing.
they
say
that
the
orders
were
contrary
to
the
rules
and
should
be
set
aside
but
no
facts
are
setup.
my
partner,
mr.
hatton,
prepared
judge
la
buy's
answers.
i
was
trying
a
case
before
judge
perry
at
the
time
and
didn't
get
active
in
the
case
until
the
arguments
came
along.
the
answers
set
forth
the
second
amendment
complaints
in
each
of
the
cases.
some
of
the
answers,
there
are
number
of
defendants,
i
think,
two
or
three
answers
in
each
case
to
show
the
issues,
some
of
the
answers
to
interrogatory
showing
the
extremely
complicated
and
technical
accounting
type
of
testimony
that
will
be
involved
in
this
case.
so,
from
the
--
and
--
and
the
court
below
said,
the
majority,
that
the
case
was
decided
on
the
pleadings
and
judge
la
buy's
answer
contains
all
of
the
pleading
about
the
cases
and
they
--
it
was
not
disputed
by
the
person
seeking
the
mandamus.
so,
those
are
the
facts.
i'm
going
to
ask
mr.
levy
to
confine
himself
in
his
argument
to
the
facts
as
they
are
in
the
record
because
i
won't
be
able
to
contradict
him
in
whatever
he
says
if
its
outside
of
the
records
since
i
don't
know
anything
about
it.
but
i
am
going
to
confine
myself
to
the
record.
these
cases,
the
first
one
is
the
rohlfing
case
where
87
plaintiff
shoe
repairmen
sue
25
defendants
who
either
manufacturers
of
shoe
repair
materials
or
rubber
heels
or
shoe
polish
or
were
what
they
called
"preferred
distributors"
or
were
chain
store
and
whole
sale
department
store
operators
of
shoe
repair
departments.
originally,
it
was
in
one
company.
it
alleged
violations
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
law,
section
2
of
the
sherman
law,
conspiracies
in
both
cases,
section
2
(a)
of
the
robinson-patman
act
and
section
3
of
the
robinson-patman
act,
in
other
words,
discriminatory
sales
and
a
conspiracy
to
make
such
sales.
in
this
--
in
striking
some
of
the
first
complaints,
the
judge
required
the
plaintiffs
to
each
set
his
claim
up
separately.
at
this,
the
plaintiffs
were
added
and
the
second
complaint
contained
105
counts.
the
first
count
though
was
a
blunderbuss
account
similar
to
the
first
complaint.
and
judge
la
buy
struck
that.
so,
the
second
amended
complaint
consists
just
of
100
--
i
think
in
five
counts,
one
for
each
plaintiff
alleging
these
various
violations.
now,
as
i
read
the
pleadings,
and
i
am
going
to
summarize
it
to
give
a
picture,
it
seems
that
the
plaintiffs
themselves
don't
buy
directly
from
these
manufacturers
who
are
bringing
the
mandamus
suits
but
they
buy
through
finders
and
the
complaint
is
that
there's
a
conspiracy
among
all
these
people,
so
that
the
plaintiff
who
are
small
operators
do
not
get
to
buy
at
the
favored
prices
that
some
of
the
other
defendants
do.
to
decide
that
case
will
require
a
proof
of
the
--
of
transactions
of
purchase
and
sale
between
all
of
these
various
parties.
many
of
which
are
set
forth,
some
of
the
transactions
in
the
answers
of
the
interrogatories.
and
i
think
the
best
description
of
the
complexity
of
this
case
is
the
--
that
set
forth
by
the
defendants
themselves
and
a
brief
they
filed
with
judge
la
buy
on
the
second
--
on
--
on
the
amended
complaint
which
is
exactly
like
this
complaint
except
that
this
complaint
drop
one
of
the
105
counts.
now,
in
that
--
that
memorandum,
they
discussed
the
type
of
testimony
that
would
have
to
be
put
into
the
case.
they
said
it
would
be
practically
impossible
to
track
the
case
that's
the
--
worse
that
the
trial
would
be
fantastically
complicated,
i
think,
which
is
true.
and
they
pointed
out
the
type
of
detail
evidence
of
each
man
against
each
defendant
that
would
have
to
be
put
in
evidence.
the
--
the
second
case,
i
might
say
that
in
that
case,
there
are
still
87
plaintiffs
due
to
apparently
settlements
or
something,
there
are
now
six
defendants,
including
the
two
before
this
court.
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
well,
what
--
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
they
were
seeking
to
strike
the
complaint,
the
--
the
amended
complaint,
there
was
a
--
a
motion
and
support
of
their
motion
or
brief
in
support
of
their
motion
to
strike
the
amended
complaint
and
they
were
describing
the
type
of
trial
that
they
would
have
to
conduct.
now,
that
still
remains
true
because
only
one
count
was
dropped
of
that
complaint.
the
--
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
they're
non-jury
cases.
now,
then,
that
the
cases,
the
judge
had
this
problem
with
his
docket.
the
record
shows
that
he
had
the
most
criminal
cases
which
of
course
were
entitled
to
preference
of
any
of
the
judges
to
probably
do
that
in
the
du
pont
hearing
that
he
have
the
most
cases
all
together
of
all
but
one
of
the
judges.
so,
his
problem
of
congestion
was
different
than
the
other
judges
and
i
might
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
recognized
in
another
case
which
they
cite
in
their
majority
opinion,
the
so-called
rock
island
against
igoe
case,
the
congestion
of
the
federal
courts
in
chicago,
generally.
in
a
footnote
in
that
opinion,
footnote
2,
that
was
a
1954
opinion
where
they
used
our
court
of
appeals,
used
general
congestion
of
the
courts
below
to
say
that
judge
igoe
had
abused
his
discretion
and
not
sending
to
iowa
for
trial,
a
case
where
the
railroad
had
asked
it
to
be
sent
out
there
under
the
forum
non-convenience
statute.
so,
there
is
general
congestion
in
chicago
but
judge
la
buy's
problem
was
peculiar
until
the
du
pont.
now,
in
their
brief,
they
said
that
this
is
not
a
section
3
of
the
robinson-patman
act
case.
i
don't
understand
how
they
can
say
it.
the
complaint
so
alleges
that's
under
section
3
and
judge
la
buy's
opinion
so
has
so
found
in
overruling
the
motions
for
summary
judgment
made
by
certain
defendants.
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
thank
you.
when
we
adjourned
last
evening,
i
had
just
referred
to
a
memorandum
of
the
defendants
including
howes
leather
company
and
montgomery
ward
by
judge
la
buy
below,
in
support
of
a
motion
to
strike
the
amended
complaint.
they
said
it
will
be
next
to
impossible
for
this
court
to
try
the
case,
as
the
pleading
now
stands.
the
trial
will
be
reminiscent
of
a
battle
royal.
there
are
104
plaintiffs
and
10
defendant
manufacturers.
considered
as
price
discrimination
case,
there
are
1040
separate
distinct
and
unrelated
price
discrimination
claims.
there
may
be
10
in
each
count,
from
count
two
through
count
105.
each
plaintiff
was
shown,
not
only
the
price
in
which
purchases
were
made
from
a
manufacture
by
a
defendant
department
or
a
chain
store
in
competition
with
him,
he
must
also
show
that
he'd
want
to
go
to
like
a
greater
quality
from
the
same
seller
at
a
higher
price
and
that
the
effect
thereof
was
to
substantially
less
than
competition.
the
trial
would
be
fantastically
complicated.
and
in
their
brief,
they
underlined
the
words
"fantastically
complicated."
now,
the
number
of
counts
remains
the
same
less
one,
104
counts.
however,
there
will
only
be
87
counts
to
try
because
some
of
the
plaintiffs
have
been
dropped
by
the
wayside
for
one
reason
or
another,
but
at
least
some
600
separate
claims.
the
type
of
evidence
in
this
type
of
case,
of
course,
will
be
tedious
and
documentary.
at
the
hearing,
just
preceding
the
reference
to
the
master,
the
plaintiffs'
lawyer
stated,
and
it's
in
the
record,
he
did
have
to
fire
--
hire
eight
express
stenographer
just
to
answer
the
defendant's
interrogatories.
judge
la
buy
mentioned
in
the
same
hearing
that
he
thought
he'd
heard
more
motions
in
this
case
as
rohling
case
than
in
any
other
case
he
ever
had.
and
the
--
the
docket
which
is
set
up
in
the
record,
covers
28
large
pages
of
just
the
entries
of
the
orders.
judge
la
buy
has
become
quite
familiar
with
the
general
scope
of
the
case
and
has
written
six
opinions
of
which
four
of
them
reported,
one,
in
15
federal
rules
decisions
striking
the
original
complaint,
dismissing
certain
defendants,
quashing
certain
services,
17
federal
decisions
overruling
a
motion
to
strike
the
second
amended
complaint,
that's
the
one
we're
here
of.
20
federal
rules
decisions
allowing
howes
leather
company
and
their
motion
to
inspect
certain
agreements
to
dismiss,
entered
into
by
the
plaintiffs
or
other
defendants
to
see
if
they
didn't,
perhaps,
release
them.
and
in
20
federal
rules
decisions
there's
a
--
two
opinions
refusing
summary
judgements
to
two
defendants,
i
think
armour
&
company
and
gold
glass.
the
basis
for
that
was
they
claim
they
had
not
made
any
sales
to
the
--
the
plaintiffs
but
the
court
pointed
out
they
were
charged
with
conspiring
with
others.
so
nothing
could
be
decided
on
summary
judgment.
i
think
the
record
shows
that
judge
la
buy
knew
the
scope
of
this
case
when
he
made
these
references,
had
done
a
great
deal
of
work
in
it
and
that
it
is
a
very
unusual,
complex
case
involving
a
peculiar
kind
of
tedious,
probably
uncontroversial
testimony,
consisting
largely
of
records
of
sales.
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
the
judge
estimated
it
would
take
two
months.
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
the
plaintiff
estimated
it
would
take
six
weeks
and
he
said
that
the
defendants
counsel
has
previously
told
them
it
would
take
two
months
for
the
plaintiff's
case
but
on
the
hearing,
the
defendant's
counsel,
he
shortened
up
his
estimate.
the
judge
said
two
months
and
i
think
that's
a
fair
estimate.
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
everybody
objected
to
the
reference
probably
on
the
ground
that
it
would
cost
some
money.
however,
nobody
has
objected
on
the
ground
that
he
couldn't
afford
to
pay
his
or
rate
of
share.
there
isn't
any
impossibility
of
their
paying.
no
showing
at
all
that
they
couldn't
pay
whatever
reasonable
fees
are
involved.
that
would
be
a
special
case.
i
recognize
it.
if
--
if
the
judge
insisted
on
referring
a
case
and
one
of
the
party
says,
“i
can't
pay”
so
there
couldn't
be
any
decision,
that's
a
different
cast
than
this.
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
i
would
answer
that
no,
from
my
own
experience
of
27
years.
however,
in
the
reply
brief,
the
other
side
referred
to
one
sentence
in
a
case
where
the
judge
who
wrote
this
opinion,
i
believe,
said
that
they
thought
they
were
too
common,
too
common
in
the
district.
the
references
were
too
common.
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
judge
la
buy,
the
record
shows
this.
in
six
years,
now
and
despite
the
difficulties
that
i
mentioned
yesterday
with
the
long
cases,
judge
la
buy
has
personally
made
only
nine
references
of
which
only
five
were
general
references
and
the
other
four
were
limited
issues.
that's
in
the
record.
so,
he
hasn't
been
guilty
of
that
persistent
refusal
to
follow
the
rule
that
was
condemned
in
one
of
these
--
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
he
gets
paid
from
the
party
as
i
assume
because
he
has
the
right
to
say
--
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
well,
that's
covered
by
the
rule.
before
the
--
the
present
rule
was
adopted,
the
master
could
attach
for
his
fees.
now,
he
gets
an
execution.
he
collects
them
like
any
other
creditor.
now,
let's
take
that
part,
because
i
think
the
court
below
had
the
idea
that
if
the
only
agreed
cases
could
be
referred.
now,
of
course,
you
never
have
any
trouble
about
that
if
everybody
agrees.
i
participated
on
that
when
nobody
objects.
however,
the
rule
provides
farther
on
that
there
may
be
references.
it
--
it
clearly
implies
that
there
can
be
references
from
absent
agreement
because
rule
53
(e)
(4),
part
of
the
same
rule
provides,
"the
effect
of
a
master's
report
is
the
same
whether
or
not
the
parties
have
consented
to
the
reference”.
now,
that
was
put
in
there,
i
think,
because
of
the
armour's
case,
where
there
used
to
be,
long
ago,
a
difference
in
the
finality
of
the
findings
where
it
was
a
consent
reference
and
where
it
wasn't.
what
this
obviously
indicates
and
contemplates
references
absent
consent,
if
you
can't
read
it
otherwise.
now,
actually,
if
the
rule
is
to
be
helpful
to
the
court,
and
i'm
speaking
now
from
the
point
of
view
with
the
trial
court,
consent
should
not
be
important
because
the
case
he
finds
he
needs
to
refer
and
calls
for
it
on
his
nature
may
be
one
where
somebody
doesn't
wish
to
have
it
referred.
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
i
think
that's
fair
to
say.
the
--
perhaps
the
court
reporters
fee
might
be
different.
i
don't
think
i
can
answer
that.
in
our
federal
court,
i
guess
everywhere,
now,
we
have
reporters,
official
reporters
and
some
of
the
judges
insist
those
official
reporters
be
used
before
the
master
and
there'd
be
no
difference.
if
you
had
a
private
reporter,
there
might
be
a
difference,
i'm
not
sure.
otherwise,
there's
no
difference.
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
no.
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
he
does
until
rule
53,
the
master
rules
on
admission
of
evidence.
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
he
--
he's
a
master
under
rule
53
operates
just
like
a
judge
and
he
rules
on
questions
of
evidence
but
he
also
frequently
reports
excluded
evidence
under
rule
43
something
or
rather
just
as
the
trial
judge
does
for
the
help
of
the
court
above.
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
i
think
i
can
answer
that,
no.
there
are
--
that
the
cases
in
our
circuit
on
masters
are
cited
on
the
various
briefs.
there's
allusions
to
fees
as
being
an
item.
there
has
been
no
flagrant
abuse
of
fees
r
in
any
of
the
reported
cases
in
our
circuit.
and
i
would
say
this.
that,
i
think
judge
la
buy
should
be
entitled
to
have
his
conduct
judged
on
its
own
merits.
if
some
other
judge,
and
i
doubt
it
myself,
has
been
guilty
of
abusing
this
rule,
i
don't
think
judge
la
buy
should
be
made
to
vacate
this
particular
reference
if
it
was
a
proper
one.
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
what
we
would
like
to
--
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
no.
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
that's
why
we're
here
to
find
out
just
what
the
court
meant
on
that
case
and
the
cosgrave
case
and
i
don't'
really
know
because
this
case
was
a
memorandum
opinion
and
i
have
my
idea,
which
if
it
coincides,
i
would
say,
where
the
judge
made
on
his
dissent.
mr.
levy
has
his
opinion
which
is
reflected
by
the
majority.
now,
let
me
say
this,
too.
we're
here
construing
rule
53
as
it
is.
it
obviously
permits
references
with
limitations.
it
doesn't
forbid
though,
i
think
the
ruling
of
the
court
below
has
forbidden
them
in
our
circuit
except
in
matters
of
account.
and
for
all
practical
purposes
there
it
had
meant.
now,
that
wasn't,
i
don't
believe,
the
purpose
of
the
rule.
if
this
court
feels
that
the
time
for
doing
away
with
masters
that's
here,
and
there
is
some
movement
that
way,
that
maybe
the
party
shouldn't
ever
be
required
to
pay
for
their
hearing
the
way
you
do
with
a
master's
hearing.
that
should
be
done
by
an
amendment
of
the
rule.
there
are
several
reasons
why
that
should
be
that
way.
in
the
first
place,
if
that
disrupts
things
in
various
circuits
so
they
need
more
judges,
the
rules
go
before
congress
for
a
period
of
time
where
they
laid
fallow
until
they
become
effective
and
congress
could
maybe
apply
--
provide
more
judges
where
they're
needed
or
other
things
could
be
done.
i
don't
think
that
that
should
be
accomplished
by
a
nullification
of
the
present
rule,
which
clearly
contemplates
the
use
of
masters.
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
no.
now
--
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
i
don't.
i
argue
that
it
wasn't
under
roche
and
of
the
harlan
cases.
and
i
think
our
court
has
not
followed
those
cases
as
scrupulously
as
it
says
it
has
followed
cosgrave
in
this
case.
i
--
i
say
all
this
with
no
--
i
--
i
would
like
to
pay
some
credit
to
our
court
of
appeals.
it's
a
good
court.
there
isn't
any
feed
in
this
case.
we'd
like
to
get
the
rule
clarified
but
nobody
is
excited.
our
court
is
very
--
our
court
of
appeals
is
very
diligent
and
it
is
in
court,
decides
its
case
very
punctually
and
expects
good
service
from
the
lower
judges.
so,
in
anything
i
say
here,
i'm
not
against
the
court
of
appeals.
i
think
they
have
made
some
errors
in
this
decision
and
that's
why
i
asked
this
court
to
review
it.
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
i
cannot
answer
that.
i
don't
know
of
any.
i
know
occasionally
there
have
been
some.
i
noticed
in
moore
that
he
--
he
says
in
his
recent
book
that
they're
considering
using
masters
that
they
--
that
that's
being
considered
in
antitrust
cases
as
and
--
and
perhaps
they
would
amend
the
rules
specially
for
that.
and
i
refer
to
note
39
on
page
2944
of
this
second
edition.
because
of
the
unusual
complexity
or
difficulty
in
determining
the
economic
and
scientific
facts
underlying
certain
cases
of
great
magnitude
particularly
many
of
the
large
antitrust
cases.
many
goes
on
to
say
that
on
the
other
hand,
a
commission
on
which
judge
lindley
participated
and
i
think
this
influenced
him
somewhat.
he
--
he
was
on
the
majority
below,
decided
just
without
much
comment
in
a
report.they
thought
maybe
that
shouldn't
be
done.
but
i
don't
think
that
whether
it
should
be
done
as
a
general
practice,
it
should
be
controlling
in
this
particular
case.
now,
the
--
let
me
discuss
the
--
the
rule
a
minute
with
you
if
i
may.
i
don't
think
there's
any
prohibition
in
this
rule.
certainly,
there
isn't
of
general
references.
they
are
used,
they
are
contemplated,
there
is
some
special
authority
for
limited
issue
references
and
mr.
morris
says
on
this,
the
scope
of
the
reference
maybe
defined
by
the
order
of
reference
but
is
indicated
by
the
use
of
the
word
"may"
in
the
rule
and
the
general
grant
of
power
given
by
the
second
sentence
of
subdivision
(c)
a
reference
containing
no
limitations
is
a
general
reference
to
report
all
the
issues
both
the
law
in
fact
involved
in
a
litigation,
and
most
references
are
general
references.
that's
my
comment.
the
exceptional
condition
can't
be
limited
to
consent
references
that
i
think
the
court
below
would
like
to
do,
because
the
rule
contemplates
references
without
consent
as
i've
already
pointed
out.
that
the
special
condition
can't
be
matters
of
account
because
all
are
specially
provided
for.
there
isn't
any
limitation
in
the
rule
as
to
what
type
of
circumstances
the
court
should
consider
but
they
must
be
exceptional.
the
lower
courts
and
we
review
these
cases,
since
the
--
this
really
goes
back
to
1912,
when
they
adopted
the
equity
rules
which
are
practically
these
same
rules.
some
differences
but
not
in
the
most
part
(inaudible0,
and
they
have
always
considered
congestion
is
one
circumstance
that
could
be
from
time
to
time
considered.
there
are
some
cases
to
the
contrary
including
the
one
we're
reviewing.
now,
the
court
--
the
circuits
have
disagreed
a
little
bit
as
to
whether
this
exceptional
circumstance
must
be
inherent
in
the
case
or
can
be
extraneous.
in
kirkpatrick,
the
third
circuit
case
and
if
we're
doing
the
admiralty
rule
said
the
things
must
be
inherent
in
the
case,
in
the
nature
of
the
case.
you
couldn't
consider
the
death
of
a
judge
or
congestion.
perhaps,
that's
what's
meant.
i
don't
know.
other
--
other
courts
such
as
our
circuit
seem
to
think
it
should
be
extraneous
are
not
in
the
case.
that
the
case
can't
be
in
its
nature
such
that
it
would
be
justified
reference
unless
it's
an
accounting
case.
i
think
that
both
types
should
be
considered,
each
case
judged
on
its
own
and
--
and
either
way
you
look
at
in
this
case,
both
the
internal
and
the
external
circumstances
were
present.
now,
the
judge
--
the
judges
below
did
some
reasoning
and
i
--
i
can't
follow
this
reasoning.
it
seems
in
like
(inaudible)
to
me.
it
says
that
in
jury
cases,
this
is
a
footnote
to
the
majority
claim.
only
complicated
cases
can
be
referred.
now,
of
course,
the
jury
thing
came
in
with
ex
parte
peterson
in
the
early
20s
but
under
the
immediate
predecessors
of
these
rules
substantially
the
same.
and
they
were
justifying
for
the
first
time,
the
use
of
a
--
of
a
master
in
a
jury
case.
now,
obviously,
the
only
reason
for
using
it
in
the
jury
case
is
because
it's
too
complicated
for
a
jury,
they
want
to
straighten
these
accounts
out
a
bit.
that
is
the
rational
of
that
decision.
the
fact
that
that
is
the
kind
of
a
case
that
can
be
referred
to
a
jury
case,
shouldn't
at
all
mean
that
you
couldn't
consider
the
complication
of
the
case
in
an
equity
case.
that's
the
only
kind
of
a
jury
case
that
can
be
referred
and
i
think
that's
proper.
otherwise,
your
right
to
a
jury
trial
becomes
infringed.
but
the
complicated
cases
have
been
the
more
common
subjects
of
reference
usually
as
the
court
--
as
our
court
of
appeals
said
in
that
adventures
of
good
eating
case
that
mr.
levy
quotes
and
the
majority
quotes
and
--
and
what
judge
evans,
who
was
a
fine
judge,
used
some
good
language
in
showing
some
of
the
evils
of
master's
references,
said
there
should
have
been
one
in
that
case.
but
that
was
a
simple
case
and
the
reason
he
said
it
was,
it
only
took
eight
hours
to
hear.
well,
the
judge
could
have
heard
it.
the
--
the
--
what
the
judge
says
about
a
case
that
takes
eight
hours
to
hear,
hardly
should
be
applied,
without
at
least
some
second
thought
and
the
case
is
going
to
take
two
months
and
involves
100
parties,
each
would
claims
against
the
other.
now,
the
complicated
cases
in
equity
are
referred
for
a
different
reason
in
the
law.
it
isn't
because
the
judge
can't
handle
them.
obviously,
he
can
do
better
than
his
master.
it's
because,
as
judge
hand
said,
in
the
pennsylvania
railroad
number
32
case,
which
we
cite
in
the
brief.
and
--
and
he
said
that
the
--
that
the
equity
complicated
case
is
referred
because
it
takes
a
long
time
to
hear
and
it's
tedious.
and
it
saves
the
judge's
time
and
lets
them
get
on
with
their
business.
i
think
it
shouldn't
be
forbidden.
now,
is
--
the
court
below
seemed
to
think
that,
as
i
read
their
footnote,
that
--
that
you
can
refer
more
jury
cases
now
than
non-jury
case.
you
can't
refer
complicated
case
in
equity
but
you
can
at
law
with
the
jury.
well
that
seems
ridiculous.
moore
states
that
although,
he
says
rule
53
makes
provisions
for
master
and
both
jury
and
non-jury
actions
although,
its
chief
use
will
be
on
non-jury
actions.
the
court
below
doesn't
seem
to
agree
with
that.
and
in
ex
parte
peterson
where
this
court
authorized
the
use
of
a
master,
in
a
law
case,
in
a
jury
case,
the
court
said
this
253
u.s.
at
page
314,
"but
no
reason
exist."
now,
owing
to
the
differences
in
the
character
of
the
proceedings
and
of
the
questions
ordinarily
involved,
the
occasion
for
seeking
such
aid
as
is
afforded
by
special
masters'
orders
and
examiners
arises
less
frequently
at
law,
than
in
equity.
well
i
think
that's
everybody's
experience.
we
--
we
never
have
reference
in
a
jury
case
in
chicago.
i
never
heard
of
one.
and
now,
on
the
same
case,
ex
parte
peterson,
this
court
said,
"but
no
reason
exists
while
a
compulsory
reference
to
an
order
simplify
and
clarify
the
issues
and
make
tentative
findings,
may
not
be
made
at
law
when
occasion
rises
as
freely
as
compulsory
references
to
special
masters
remain
in
equity."
it's
in
--
in
the
non-jury
cases
that
the
references
should
be
the
more
frequent.
now,
then,
why
did
the
court
--
here's
a
discretionary
order,
it
seems
to
be
very
reasonable,
made
by
a
judge
who
was
very
familiar
with
the
case
and
had
special
problems
because
of
du
pont.
and
why
did
they
vacate
it?
well
they
did
it
because
they
thought
this
court
simply
had
to.
that's
what
they
say.
and
they
--
and
they
may
base
it
on
mccullough
versus
cosgrave
which
in
turn
based
on
the
james
case
that
judge
frankfurter
mentioned.
now,
in
the
james
case,
and
in
the
mccullough
case,
the
charges
seemed
to
be
very
parallel.
they
charged
that
there
was,
in
--
in
effect,
an
agreement,
a
concert
among
the
judges
in
a
certain
district
in
california
to
refer
practically
all
patent
cases
to
masters,
to
a
master,
a
standing
master,
who
heard
nothing
else
and
that
they
referred
no
other
type
of
cases
and
they
were
discriminating
against
patent
litigation.
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
yes,
mr.
collin
is
a
--
a
lawyer
in
a
law
firm
and
he's
--
he
engages
in
the
practice
of
law.
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
he
is
not
a
standing
master
--
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
--
but
i
will
say,
although
the
record
doesn't
show
it
that
--
that
--
because
i
know
what,
that
judge
la
buy
has
referred
cases
more
frequently
than
him
than
other
masters.
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
yes,
they're
authorized
by
the
rule.
i
don't
have
a
full
--
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
i
--
i
don't
think
mr.
(inaudible)
standing
master,
i'm
not
sure.
if
you
would
like
to
be
informed
i
--
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
i'm
not
sure
whether
he
is
--
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
the
rule
mentions
them
they
can
be
had.
i
--
i'm
trying
to
think
he's
not
a
standing
master
and
that
we
have
none.
but
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
i
will
say
because
i
know
it
so
that
judge
la
buy
most
frequently
is
--
referred
to
references
when
he
asked
them
to
this
particular
master.
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
i'd
have
to
read
the
order.
i
--
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
master
hearings
are
seldom
continuous.
they
usually
are
discontinuous
for
the
convenience
of
the
parties.
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
well,
i'm
saying
that's
why
they
do
it,
i
think.
that's
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
sometimes
agree
to
a
reference
or
don't
object
to
it.
the
--
the
orders
are
attached
to
the
petitions
for
mandamus
and
one
that
says
is,
"shall
commence
the
trial
on
may
2nd,
19
--
and
shall
thereafter
continue
with
all
reasonable
diligence."
it
doesn't
say
it
has
to
be
continuous
but
obviously
it
should
be
more
or
less
so.
now,
i
think
that
--
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
that
was
the
charge
and
that's
--
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
that's
right.
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
that's
right.
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
we
have
nothing
like
that
here.
now,
the
--
the
--
that
is
the
fact
in
the
--
in
those
two
cases
that
led
me
and
they
have
the
dissenting
judge
below
to
feel
that
they
didn't
control
this
case.
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
i
read
the
records,
they're
the
same,
except
that
in
the
second
one,
you
have
a
conviction
because
of
the
fact
that
they
never
referred
anything
but
these
patent
cases
to
the
master
and
he
was
a
standing
master
and
he
couldn't
practice
law
and
did
nothing
else
that
they
were
just
sticking
to
that
rule.
now
--
now
this
court
--
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
that's
--
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
that's
the
case.
incidentally,
in
the
roche
case,
that
is
what
this
court
said
in
the
roche
opinion
and
that's
how
it
characterized
that
mccullough
versus
cosgrave
and
it
was
because
they
wanted
the
court
to
have
a
clue
in
the
roche
opinion
that
we
heard
is
on
the
judge
and
what
was
it
condemned
was
this
persistent
refusal
to
follow
the
rule.
the
--
the
i'm
referring
all
those
with
the
kind
of
cases
to
the
master.
now
then,
i
--
i
don't
want
to
take
very
much
more
of
your
time
but
i
am
--
i
would
like
to
also
discuss
with
you
the
power
of
the
court
that
below,
the
issue
of
mandamus
to
correct
an
interlocutory
order.
on
the
basis
of
the
roche
case
and
bankers
life
versus
holland,
we
think
the
court
below
did
not
have
authority
to
review
this
interlocutory
order
since
its
jurisdiction
was
in
no
way
threatened.
it
was
going
to
get
this
case
on
appeal
sooner
or
later.
the
--
i
won't
--
now,
i
won't
take
time
to
discuss
those
cases.
they're
discussed
in
the
briefs
and
are
recent
and
they're
familiar
to
your
honors.
they
are
based
on
this.
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
wholly
statutory.
that
it
has
only
appellate
jurisdiction
and
that
it's
--
the
right
to
review
interlocutory
appeals
is
strictly
limited
to
certain
types
of
appeals
not
including
this
one.
and
roche
and
bankers
both
condemned
the
efforts
of
courts
of
appeals
to
review
interlocutory
orders
by
using
these
extraordinary
writs
particularly
mandamus
and
thereby,
just
slipping
around
at
the
end
of
the
congressional
bar.
now,
it's
important
that
they
not
be
encouraged
to
interrupt.
now,
take
this
case.
it's
been
interrupted
for
a
year
and
three
quarters
while
we
argue
this
one.
now,
they
might
have
had
to
pay
some
thousands
of
dollars
to
get
the
masters
hearing
but
the
case
would
have
probably
been
decided
if
this
hadn't
occurred.
and
that
evil
is
very
eloquently
discussed
in
the
(inaudible)
case
in
the
third
circuit
by
judge
goodrich
or
he
--
he
says
talking
now
about
forms
now
inconvenience
reviews
that
they're
going
to
just
ruin
the
rule.
if
the
courts
review
all
those
by
mandamus
and
stop
the
cases
while
they
do
it.
that
they
want
to
gain
a
thing
we
have
lost.
now,
i've
already
said
that
i
have
a
good
opinion
of
our
court
of
appeals
and
there's
a
good
feeling
in
the
circuit
and
there's
no
heat
in
this
case.
but,
having
said
that,
i
want
to
say
that
i
think
the
--
that
our
court
of
appeals
does
think
it
can
review
any
order
at
once
that
it
considers
wrong
by
mandamus
and
i
will
rely
on
the
two
cases
it
cites
for
its
right.
and
those
were
the
two
cases
against
judge
igoe
and
filed
in
the
chicago
rock
island
&
pacific.
one
is
the
212
f.2d
378
and
both
of
them
are
subsequent
to
the
roche
and
bankers
life
decisions
in
this
court.
in
that
case,
at
page
380,
the
objection
made
to
the
issues
of
mandamus
was
the
same
as
we're
making,
stated
and
this
is
from
the
court's
opinion,
stated
in
the
light
most
favor
to
respondent.
the
contention
is
that
the
granting
or
denying
of
a
motion
to
transfer
rests
in
a
sound
discretion
of
the
trial
court
and
the
mandamus
will
not
lie
to
review
its
disposition.
so
let
me
discuss
roche
and
bankers
and
decide
they
can
do
it.
they
--
they
that
decided
those
don't
stop
them
and
they
--
then
they
have
remanded
it.
in
this
case,
judge
igoe
had
refused
to
send
the
case
to
another
more
convenient
jurisdiction
or
one
alleged
to
be
over
in
iowa,
but
he
hadn't
considered
or
the
court
felt
he
hadn't
considered
the
true
ground
specified
in
the
statute.
so,
they
remanded
the
cause
of
the
district
court
with
directions
to
vacate
the
order
and
to
reconsider
petitioner's
motion
in
the
light
of
the
views
herein
expressed.
then
they
said,
on
the
decision
on
that
motion
is
within
the
promise
of
the
district
court
and
we
cannot
as
petitioner
would
have
us
do,
usurp
its
function
and
decide
the
question
in
this
court.
but
what
have
they
do?
judge
igoe
went
back
and
heard
it
again
including
some
new
facts,
including
that
the
plaintiff
had
moved
to
chicago
and
married
a
chicago
man
or
something.
he
refused
the
transfer
and
they
issued
another
mandamus
and
made
him
transfer.
and
in
that
case,
now
this
is
the
second
time
they
certainly
are
controlling
as
to
discretion.
the
--
the
--
judge
finnegan
wrote
a
rather
cogent
dissent.
he
was
all
alone.
it
was
an
en
banc
decision.
and
he
said,
he
refer
--
use
these
words.
that
they
were
currently
usurping
the
district
court's
function
to
decide
in
the
question
in
this
court.
i
think
we
now
usurp
where
we
once
refrained.
if
we
are
substituting
our
discretion
for
that
of
respondent,
we
ought
to
say
so
and
be
done
with
it.
i
think
they
did
in
that
case.
i
think
they
did
in
this
case.
now,
i
don't
think
they
do
have
the
power
or
if
they
have
the
power
and
i
don't
care
whether
they
have
the
power
and
shouldn't
use
it
or
whether
they
don't
have
the
power.
but
they
shouldn't
use
it.
that's
what
roche
and
bankers
life
say
and
they
are
using
it.
and
perhaps
it's
trying
to
do
a
very
good
job
in
the
circuit
but
what,
to
be
the
effective
it
is,
it
interrupts
these
trials.
and
it's
--
it's
--
it
does
bother
the
district
courts
in
the
carrying
out
of
their
work.
now,
this
idea
of
roche
and
bankers
life
isn't
new.
the
--
as
long
ago
was,
maryland
versus
soper,
270
u.s.
9.
they
said
mandamus
is
an
extraordinary
remedy.
this
is
the
decision
of
this
court
which
in
civil
cases
doesn't
rely
to
compel
the
reversal
of
a
decision
either
interlocutory
or
final
made
in
the
exercise
of
a
lawful
jurisdiction,
especially
where
in
regular
course
the
decision
maybe
reviewed
upon
writ
of
error
repealed.
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
it
was
a
--
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
not
only
that
--
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
that's
right.
in
the
soper
case,
they
issued
a
writ
to
make
them
remand
--
remand
to
the
state
court
for
a
criminal
trial
and
in
all
of
those
state
court
criminal
cases,
they
have
to
do
that
because
if
there
is
an
acquittal
in
the
federal
court
there
is
no
review
at
all.
and
the
only
way
the
--
there
is
no
other
remedy
you
see
and
the
--
the
right
of
this
court
to
review
it
is
threatened.
so,
in
the
criminal
cases
they
had
this
--
said
in
the
hardin
case
are
all
different
because
there
is
no
review
from
an
acquittal
in
a
criminal
case.
well,
now,
that
is
really
all
i
have
to
say,
i
don't
--
i
thought
that
the
court
below
had
misconstrued
the
mccullough
verus
cosgrave,
i
wasn't
sure
of
it.
i'm
not
sure
of
it
yet.
we
would
like
a
--
an
interpretation
and
i
think
perhaps
the
court
of
appeals
should
not
be
encouraged
to
issue
this
peremptory
writs
of
mandamus
to
control
this
question
of
trial
judges.
thank
you.
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
if
the
court
please.
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
i
think
i
have
a
few
moments
for
reply.
i'd
like
to
answer
the
last
point
first,
just
because
in
my
mind,
in
that
narragansett
case,
the
petition
for
mandamus
was
not
filed
in
the
court
of
--
the
first
circuit
refused
to
permit
it
to
be
filed.
they
didn't
reach
the
merits.
they
said
it
won't
--
a
remedy
doesn't
exist.
the
kirkpatrick
case
in
the
third
circuit
that
he
mentioned
just
before,
as
a
case
exactly
like
cosgrave.
there
was
a
practice
in
that
circuit
in
referring
all
admiralty
cases
to
a
standing
master.
it
was
the
practice,
it
was
the
habit
or
the
concerted
habit
of
referring
these
admiralty
cases
in
group
to
the
master
that
was
condemned
in
that
case.
it's
a
case
exactly
like
cosgrave.
and
that's
very
clear
from
the
opinion.
the
--
the
circuits
that
do
not
think
they
have
the
power
are
the
fourth
circuit
which
just
decided
a
case
since
my
original
brief
was
filed
and
which
is
in
the
reply
brief
and
is
clayton
against
warlick,
232
f.2d
699,
which
joins
the
first
circuit
and
the
eighth
circuit
and
the
third
circuit,
i
would
say,
in
the
view
we
take
of
the
all
writs
act.
now,
i
--
i
must
take
exception
to
mr.
levy's
statement
of
the
facts
of
the
case.
i
didn't
think
i
would
have
to
do
it.
the
brief
he
filed,
and
i
read
from,
didn't
move
to
strike
count
one
of
that
complaint,
as
he
said.
i
read
from
page
201
of
the
record.
"memorandum
and
support
of
motion
to
strike
amended
complaint."
it
was
the
entire
complaint.
if
he
says
it
makes
no
difference,
there
are
87
plaintiffs,
why
did
he
insist
and
get
judge
la
buy
to
agree
with
them,
that
they
must
be
set
up
in
some
87
separate
counts?
that
was
because
they
were
separate
claims
and
he
so
argued
and
still
so
argues.
i
will
let
the
court
look
at
the
brief
which
is
set
forth
in
full
at
page
201
in
the
next
two
or
three
pages.
they
set
up
the
--
the
issues
as
they
see
them
and
these
are
the
defendants
now.
i
am
reading
from
on
page
203
as
the
monopolization
complaints
paragraph
13
(a).
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
page
203.
may
i
--
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
page
201
is
where
they
show
what
they're
attacking
in
the
entire
complaint
and
then
--
the
part
i
read
to
the
court
before
is
from
207
where
they're
talking
about
the
trial.
now,
he
sees
they're
all
talking
about
count
one,
but
from
what
i
read
before,
they
say
there
may
be
ten
in
each
count
from
count
two
to
count
105.
they're
not
talking
about
count
one.
and
this
case,
that
i
challenge,
i
don't
represent
this
plaintiffs
and
i
haven't
had
any
water
to
carry
for
them.
i'm
a
little
disadvantaged
and
not
be
in
the
case
to
know
exactly
what
the
evidence
will
be,
but
this
is
very
clear
from
reading
the
judge's
opinions
which
i
read,
that
the
defendants
are
trying
to
get
somewhere
by
showing
that
some
of
them
didn't
sell
to
the
plaintiffs.
and
the
thing
complained
of,
obviously
is,
that
there
is
a
conspiracy
altogether
that
certain
middlemen
give
the
break
to
certain
favored
customers.
and
it
isn't
the
manufacturing
defendants
that
do
sell
to
the
plaintiffs
it's
that
some
middleman
who
were
involved.
that
doesn't
make
the
case
any
less
complicated
or
make
it
any
less,
87
lawsuits,
it
just
can't.
judge
la
buy's
opinion
sets
up
the
issues
and
that
appears
at
15
federal
rules
decisions,
page
44,
where
he
sets
up
the
issues
in
the
case.
now,
mr.
levy,
has
been
out
of
the
record
more
than
any.
i
don't
mind
the
court
having
any
information
that
is
accurate.
the
krinsley
case
was
not
an
antitrust
case.
if
you
read
the
opinion,
that
it
--
it
arose
out
of
an
antitrust
background.
it
was
not
an
antitrust
case.
the
court
expressly
saw
how.
that's
the
one
where
the
court
said
there
too
many
references.
that
was
judge
campbell's
case
not
judge
la
buy's.
there's
nothing
in
the
reporter
of
--
in
this
record
about
a
court
reporter
before
the
master
or
anything
about
what
the
fees
would
be.
assuming
that
mr.
levy
is
correct
and
i
don't
doubt
that,
that
the
master
asked
for
a
deposit,
that
is
provided
by
the
rule,
rule
53.
it
was
provided
by
the
order.
it
would
amount
to
about
$400
for
reach
of
these
defendants
and
around
$80
for
each
plaintiff
which
is
certainly
nothing
exorbitant.
now,
he
read
at
length
from
adventures
in
good
eating
case
about
master
fees
being
large
and
expensive.
the
fees
there
where
it
had
said
to
be
reasonable,
there
were
about
$450,
as
i
remembered.
it
was
an
eight-hour
hearing.
the
thing
that
the
court
didn't
like
was
that
the
court
would
refer
an
eight-hour
case
to
a
master.
now,
he
said
there
are
five
defendants.
the
record
shows
six
and
at
the
time
of
these
references,
there
were
12.
that
is
very
clear
and
i
refer
to
the
record
on
page
19
--
no,
at
page
17
where
the
court
on
the
day
before
he
ordered
the
references
or
when
the
question
the
masters
first
came
up
said,
in
the
rohlfing
case
there
are
12
defendants
left.
that's
page
17.
that's
when
he
entered
the
order,
there
were
now
six.
now,
the
--
the
case
is
complicated,
whether
mr.
levy
wants
to
admit
it
now
or
not.
the
kind
of
evidence
that
will
be
entered
will
be
these
accounts
of
these
purchases
of
these
shoemakers,
as
he
calls
them.
he
said
that
he
didn't
know
why
there
was
no
pretrial
contrast.
judge
la
buy
was
a
state
court
judge
in
illinois
before
he
was
a
federal
judge.
and
he's
been
a
federal
judge
a
great
many
years.
he
originated
pretrial
conferences
in
the
state
court.
he
uses
them
extensively.
but
in
this
case,
there
had
been
then,
as
he
said,
more
motions
that
in
any
case
he
ever
heard
of
and
the
parties
were
not
too
cooperative
and
it
was
very
obvious
that
there
probably
was
nothing
to
be
gained
by
a
pretrial
conference.
there,
the
motion
to
revoke
the
reference
was
made,
but
it
was
limited
to
the
fact
that
a
new
defendant
had
been
added
by
the
plaintiffs.
there
have
been
parties
added
as
well
as
dropped,
who
demanded
a
jury
trial.
they
thought
it
was
going
to
be
a
jury
case
and
that
was
the
sole
basis
for
that
motion
to
revoke.
now,
he
said
that
the
case
came
on
for
trial.
that
is
inaccurate.
before
i
cover
that,
i'd
like
to
answer
a
question.
how
do
we
assign
this
case?
they
have
a
good
system
in
our
district.
the
court
--
the
court
clerk
prints
up
some
opaque
cards
with
the
names
of
the
judges
one
on
each
card.
they
make
up
a
pack,
we'll
say
of
a
hundred
and
we
have
eight
judges,
one-eighth
of
all
the
cards
will
have
judge
la
buy's
name
on
and
one-eighth
will
have
each
of
the
other
judges.
the
clerk
or
someone
under
his
supervision
shuffles
those
cards
and
they
are
sealed
up
like
a
little
pan
so
that
you
cannot
see
the
name
of
any
judge.
in
other
words,
we
don't
--
every
fifth
case
doesn't
go
to
judge
la
buy.
he
may
not
get
any
for
18,
but
he
will
get
one-eighth
of
each
hundred
cases.
and
the
clerk
nor
anybody
else
can
tell
who's
going
to
get
the
next
case.
it's
a
--
a
good
system.
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
once
the
judge
gets
the
case,
he
keeps
the
case.
he
hears
all
motions
in
it,
and
mr.
levy
correctly
said
that
he
hears
both
criminal
and
civil
cases
and
without
any
distinction,
he
accepted
the
criminal
cases
do
have
priority
under
the
law.
now,
this
case,
we
also
have
a
system
on
the
trials
that
you
put
it
on
the
trial
call
and
that
works
its
way
up
in
a
publish
bulletin.
this
case
has
not
been
reached
for
trial.
still
below
the
line.
there's
a
line
in
there
and
they're
a
lot
of
cases
above
the
line
and
they're
supposed
to
be
ready
for
trial
and
below
the
line
they're
coming
on.
this
one
was
below
the
line,
but
this
case
have
come
up
to
number
one
below
the
line.
it
might
not
be
reached
for
a
month
or
two
or
so
but
it
was
coming
on.
and
that
was
the
situation
as
the
record
makes
perfectly
clear.
read
that
at
page
17,
where
there
--
where
the
motion
is
made
and
all
of
that
transcript
is
in
this
record.
so,
the
parties
wanted
an
early
trial
and
judge
la
buy
explained
to
them
that
he
had
cases,
said
it
would
him
to
clear
up
through
this
summer
at
best.
and
that
the
way
they
should
have
a
trial
in
this
case
this
opinion
would
by
a
master.
now
then,
he
said
that
the
reason
that
the
plaintiffs
were
objecting
to
the
trial
date,
now
it
hasn't
been
raised.
they
did
ask
to
have
it
reset
for
june.
but
it
isn't
discovery,
they
want
to
take
some
depositions
for
trial
and
they
proceeded
to
do
it
as
the
record
show.
they
took
16
depositions
after
that
date
and
before
this
--
this
mandamus
petitions
were
filed.
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
yes,
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
that
is
true
with
this
exception.
that
the
order
in
question
on
--
on
february
23rd
appears
on
page
54.
so,
all
of
the
entries
from
page
30
up
to
54
are
prior
and
there's
a
couple
of
pages
subsequent.
those
are
proceedings
in
the
trial
court,
subsequent.
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
they
were
--
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
or
there's
--
well,
there
was
this
additional
party
added.
they
had
a
jury
demand.
they
had
a
motion
about
it.
he
was
dismissed
out.
there
were
proceedings
about
discovery
and
interrogatories
and
depositions.
mr.
james
a.
sprowl
and
that's
just
the
one
case.
there
are
19
pages
of
docket
entries
in
the
latter
part
of
the
record
in
the
other
case.
and
those
appear
at
pages
22
(a)
--
220
(a)
up
through
and
including
240.
that's
in
the
second
case
which
he
says
is
extremely
simple.
these
are
not
extremely
simple
cases
and
i
think
judge
la
buy's
decisions
should
have
been
respected
on
that.
i
think
that's
all
that
i
have
to
say,
except
to
say
that
while
mr.
levy
pointed
out
the
--
the
points
of
similarity
between
the
cosgrave
case
and
this
one,
he
didn't
mention
the
reply
in
that
case
which
pointed
out
that
there
was
a
standing
master
who
heard
only
type
of
cases.
it
was
not
denied
he
ever
heard
anything
but
patent
cases
and
that
practically
all
of
them
have
been
assigned
to
him.
i
think
that's
all.
thank
you.
