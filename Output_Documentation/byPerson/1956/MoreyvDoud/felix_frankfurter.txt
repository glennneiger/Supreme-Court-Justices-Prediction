by
currency
exchanges
to
be
more
popular
than
elsewhere.
you
mean
people
to
whom
--
places
where
you
can
exchange
a
lira
or
a
gold
or
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
see.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
that
a
very
--
is
it
a
special
conception
in
illinois?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
see.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
is
--
well,
that
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
strayed
by
your
suggestion
that
you
had
more
of
them
than
other
states.
i
assume
you
were
comparing
comparables.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
comparing
comparables
but
i'm
talking
about
the
kind
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
these
things
that
were
ruled
out
here.
they
go
in
new
york
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
find
a
license,
namely,
that
if
a
fellow
wants
a
--
a
foreign
exchange
place,
it
requires
a
license,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
--
may
i
ask
--
and
--
and
that
business
could
be
carried
on
in
illinois
without
any
requirement
of
a
license?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
free
--
like
a
grocery
business?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
like
a
grocery
business?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
surprised
he
claimed
leadership
in
illinois
for
that
field.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
it's
regulated
by
the
federal
legislation,
the
american
express
company?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
he
doesn't
have
to
file
tax
and
things?
you
have
to
get
a
permission
of
congress
to
allow
consolidation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
with
--
of
which
enterprise
is
the
--
does
the
united
states
make
it
a
depository?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
very
--
the
thing
we
have
before
us?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
might
you
infer
that
the
united
states
makes
of
an
enterprise
a
depository
without
any
oversight?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
i
--
that's
why
it
puzzles
me
so
in
saying
this
is
like
a
grocery
store,
unregulated,
free.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
i
must
have
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
misunderstood
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
i
understood
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
your
answer
is
clear.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
--
you
were
quite
clear
about
that
but
i
was
puzzled
by
evidence,
they
got
the
impression
that
the
american
express
company
is
not
subject
to
scrutiny
for
its
transaction
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
that
was
a
great
shock
to
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
all
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
sorry.
i'm
responsible
for
all
this
--
this
derailment
if
it
is
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
inquiry
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
directed.
my
inquiry
was
directed
towards
this
curiosity,
namely,
if
the
state
of
illinois
take
out
some
whimsical
exception,
some
favorite
of
some
politician
or
something
that
had
no
relation
to
the
actualities
of
american
finance
and
if
--
is
that
a
fair
description
of
the
american
express
company
and
it
shocked
me
to
--
to
elect
to
infer
that
that
is
so.
i
suppose
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
this
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
responsible
of
organization.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
it
was
regulated
by
illinois.
i
meant
to
suggest
that
it
isn't
a
whimsical
choice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that
the
company
--
the
kind
of
business
which
the
plaintiffs
are
conducting
is
--
as
a
matter
of
classification,
i'm
not
using
legal
connotations
in
term,
as
a
matter
of
differentiation
that
what
the
plaintiffs
are
doing
represents
the
business
that
is
different
from
the
kind
of
business
of
these
accepted
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
let
me
ask
you
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
the
exception
weren't
made,
suppose
that
there
were
no
exception,
will
the
american
express
company
be
within
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then,
there
must
be
an
identification
between
the
class
to
which
the
plaintiff
belongs
and
--
and
what
the
express
company
belongs?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
do
reach
the
question
that
the
chief
justice
quotes?
namely,
that
an
exception
is
carved
out
from
a
class
as
to
which
it
is
claimed.
the
accepted
--
the
accepted
item
or
the
accepted
units
are
of
the
same
category
as
the
included
units.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
--
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you've
just
said
that
if
there
weren't
that
exception,
they
would
be
included.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
they
must
be
the
same
class.
i
don't
understand
it
otherwise.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
precisely
what
i'm
not
doing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
not
meaning
to
do
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
say
class
a
is
--
is
forbidden
to
do
all
people
in
class,
they
are
forbidden
to
do
something
except
jones
and
company.
i
cannot
help
but
conclude,
forgetting
all
about
law,
that
if
that
weren't
to
accept
jones
and
company,
the
jones
and
company
would
be
included.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then,
you
have
to
address
yourself
with
the
legal
question
whether
the
kind
of
circle
that's
drawn
around
giving
sanctity
to
what
the
american
express
company
is
doing,
although
the
same
as
the
prohibited
proscribed
facts
have
some
reason
in
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
a
problem,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
you
forgive
me
for
cutting
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
--
but
so
far
as
this
argument
goes,
this
isn't
the
place
to
determine
this.
you
can't
--
you
can't,
unless
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
has
spoken
on
this
question
and
except
insofar
as
we
do
from
time
to
time
give
a
great
weight
to
what
the
attorney
general
of
a
state
says.
you
can't
answer
categorically
justice
brennan's
question
if
that
hasn't
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
and
passed
on.
what
you're
telling
us
now
is
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
a
matter
of
construction
of
the
statute
to
--
an
answer
to
his
question,
it
would
--
it
would
not
be
included,
isn't
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
can
we
--
how
can
we
sit
here
and
determine
that
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
am
i
wrong
in
inferring
that
the
act
you
just
made
necessarily
involved
a
construction
of
the
statutes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
think
--
you
don't
think
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
but
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
not
--
--
i'm
not
--
i
think
--
i'm
not
parley
with
the
fact
that
you
gave
an
answer.
i'm
merely
suggesting
that
when
you
say
a
statute
excepts
by
name
--
exempts
by
name,
an
enterprise,
and
you
go
on
to
say,
but
if
that
enterprise
did
something
else
than
merely
being
the
american
express
company
would
or
wouldn't
be
within
the
statute,
you're
construing
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
mr.
wines
by
in
reply
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
you
didn't
suggest
the
scope
of
the
slaughter-house
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
leave
your
record,
when
you
appealed
to
the
record,
your
legislature
doesn't
say,
except
however
such
corporation
which
can
make
out
a
case,
it
named.
it
didn't
go
on
the
record.
you
have
to
defend
this
statute
on
the
statute
precisely
and
not
by
convincing
this
court
that
it
might
--
that
the
leverage
present
is
very
difficult
and
that
any
other
corporation
is
equally
different,
has
equal
rights.
that
isn't
what
your
legislature
did.
it
did
--
it
had
its
own
record
or
as
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right,
but
you
can't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
you
can't
thereby
change
the
fact
that
they
carved
out
the
exception
not
as
a
class
but
by
name,
candid
by
named
individuals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
i
don't
follow
it.
you
mean
that
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
might
sustain
the
prohibition
and
drop
out
the
exception
on
the
severability
theory.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
--
what
have
we
got
to
do
with
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
we
said
earlier
in
that
opinion
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
hadn't
passed
on
it
doesn't
preclude
jurisdiction.
that
was
the
point
of
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
any
event,
your
point
--
if
your
point
and
validity,
mr.
wines,
we
would
have
to
decide
that
the
exception
is
unconstitutional.
you
might
be
right
in
saying
that
that
was
done
in
dorchy
against
kansas
as
i
remember
that
there
might
be
--
some
of
it
might
be
saved
but
before
you
get
to
saving,
you
must
destroy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can't
just
say
send
it
back
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
and
then
if
they
cut
this
out,
we
wouldn't
have
a
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then,
we
wouldn't
have
a
problem.
it's
too
difficult
to
decide.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
maybe
they'll
save
us
from
trouble?
justice
felix
frankfurter
license
to
do
--
would
you
mind
stating
license
to
do
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
meaning
by
that
if
i
go
in
there,
he
will
give
me
--
he
will
give
me
a
piece
of
paper
behind
which
stands
his
solvency
and
his
credit,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
credit
for
them.
now,
as
against
the
drugstore,
it's
much
smaller
that
--
and
i
go
in
there
and
what
do
i
get
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
who's
behind
that
piece
of
paper
when
i
get
it
for
the
--
i
give
a
$100
and
i
get
a
piece
of
paper.
what
does
that
$100
piece
of
paper
represent?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
doesn't
make
much
difference
whether
it's
a
small
drugstore
or
a
big
drugstore
if
the
piece
of
paper
and
the
security
that's
behind
it,
that's
the
differentiating
factors.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
might
be
a
forger.
he
might
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
there
have
been
--
but
--
but
banks
tellers
before
could
chase
national
bank,
if
a
national
city
bank,
that
in
the
basis
on
which
legislation
we've
had
on.
the
american
express
company
is
going
to
--
that
there'd
be
a
flood
of
forgery
issued
in
it.
can't
the
legislature
of
illinois
assume
that
on
the
whole
that
is
not
the
normal
thing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
mustn't
we
assume
that
they
did
assume
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
didn't
understand
that
argument
but
i
don't
--
i
--
i
must
start
with
differentiating
between
a
--
a
drugstore
no
matter
how
big
and
solvent
in
and
of
itself
issuing
money
orders
and
the
american
express
company
issuing
(voice
overlap).
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
frazier
against
green
decided
that
about
warehouses
and
everything
else,
knows
the
court
of
ones
you
do
in
the
(inaudible)
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
the
states
--
a
state
--
a
state
have
--
talked
about
other
businesses,
suppose
the
state
had
gone
into
the
--
establishes
a
corporation,
a
state
defense
resistant
and
through
that
corporation
(inaudible)
in
new
hampshire
or
south
carolina
or
suburb
states,
dispenses
this
liquor
business
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
also
allows
private
enterprise
to
be
in
competition
with
the
state.
but
as
to
this
private
people,
it
makes
very
stringent
group,
the
kind
that
justice
brennan
read
a
little
while
ago,
qualifications
of
all
the
employees,
they
must
have
a
pristine
of
absently
pure
record,
not
even
a
traffic
violation.
would
that
be
discrimination
because
it
doesn't
make
similar
regulations
or
reference
to
employees
in
its
dispensary
corporation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
it
doesn't
--
it
chooses
not
regulate
it.
it
has
such
confident
in
the
--
in
the
civil
service
commission
of
the
state
or
whatever
the
personnel
selection
bodies
call
and
it
doesn't
make
any
regulation
except
the
choice
of
officials.
you
think
that
would
be
discrimination?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
public
office
means
that
you
have
confidence
by
means
other
than
you'll
have
with
a
case
of
people
from
whom
you
require
certain
qualification.
and
the
legislature
couldn't
make
that
distinction,
couldn't
make
a
judgment
that
if
it
is
behind
it
is
to
make
certain
regulations
or
it
doesn't
make
them
whereas
if
other
people
want
to
engage
in
that
business,
it
doesn't
make
regulation.
would
that
be
violative
of
the
discrimination
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
i
can't
imagine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
you
introduce
the
adjective
invidious.
therefore,
it
turns
on
whether
a
thing
is
invidious
and
because
you
pick
out
one
doesn't
necessarily
make
it
invidious.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
says
the
reason
that
seems
to
be
one
that
legislature
may
in
good
conscience
entertain.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
fact
that
you've
got
a
responsible
corporation
of
worldwide
significance
may
be
a
reason
that
may
appeal
to
the
legislatures
and
not
be
denominated
constitutionally
invidious.
that's
the
whole
point
about
this
discriminatory
--
the
application
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
but
you
can't
argue
from
something
--
something
very
close
to
it
which
maybe
bad.
that
doesn't
make
the
other
thing
bad.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
we
would
have
all
agreed
that
that
vindication,
the
pilot
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
if
they
had
to
take
one
family
because
we
like
them
and
you've
got
other
families
around
that
might
--
might
have
a
very
different
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
mr.
wines
has
no
business
to
have
the
record
prove
it
and
i
don't
think
you
have
any
business,
unless
you
can
show
that
no
legislature
conscientiously
dealing
with
this
problem
can
say,
we
find
security
for
our
people
in
an
organization
that
has
the
kind
of
solvency
that
the
most
respectable
and
most
reliable
drugstore
hasn't
got.
you
think
that's
so
outrageous
that
honest
legislators
mindful
merely
of
the
public
interest
can't
think
of
those
terms?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
suggest
that
illinois
is
a
part
of
the
united
states
and
it
may
take
note
of
the
fact
that
although
it's
not
in
illinois.
if
it
does
business
in
illinois,
it
carries
certain
guarantee
and
having
a
government
official
examined
the
papers
or
the
books
isn't
the
only
guarantee
in
this
world
for
reliability.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
it's
a
very
common
thing
in
legislation
dealing
with
--
with
a
state
constitutional
restriction
against
passing
separate
laws
for
any
city
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
then
define
the
city
abstractly
which
applies
only
to
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can
play
tricks
with
this
if
you
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that's
what
you
want
to
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
you
but
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
way
that's
easy
enough
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
beat
this
by
another
form
of
words
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
perfectly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
perhaps
that
that
you
wouldn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
wouldn't
give
that
an
illustration
as
one
of
the
most
admirable
edifying
aspects
of
law
would
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
yowell,
may
i
trouble
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
tell
the
--
if
you
can,
if
the
record
shows
ever
if
you
know,
what
--
what
is
the
scale
of
this
--
of
this
business
throughout
the
state,
i
don't
mean
--
to
what
extent
and
volume
--
what's
the
volume
of
dollars
to
which
--
for
which
this
kind
of
thing
is
used,
do
you
know?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
theirs,
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
before
the
legislation
was
passed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
what
extent?
justice
felix
frankfurter
hundred
or
the
millions?
is
this
a
vast
--
do
people
use
these
checks,
whatever
they
call
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
no
gross
figure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
sizeable,
i
mean
can
you
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
people
use
it
for?
who
--
who
goes
to
it?
who
--
who
resorts
to
this
need?
who
has
this
need?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
without
giving
the
--
without
giving
dollars
in
installments,
is
it
as
of
magnitude.
it's
--
it's
not
petty
business,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
in
the
aggregate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
non-sizeable
amounts,
its
total?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
we
got
any
light
as
to
what
lead
to
this
legislation,
do
you
--
does
your
legislature
print
its
journal?
do
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
we
got
any
light
on
how
this
came
to
be,
that
just
some
fellow
--
was
it
just
one
of
these
--
these
are
pieces
of
legislation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
my
question
was
not
about
the
sacred
cows
but
about
the
law
itself.
what
--
what
lead
the
legislature
to
deal
with
this
problem?do
we
know
anything
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
lots
of
legislation
comes
here.
some
years
ago
i
had
to
write
an
opinion,
the
substance
of
--
in
a
statute,
the
substance
of
which
offended
me
greatly
whereby
the
male
bartenders
got
a
law
passed
to
keep
out
the
female
bartenders
with
exceptions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
assure
you
that
that
did
not
appeal
to
me
as
a
very
chivalrous
or
even
very
intrinsically
reasonable
affair
but
we
sustained
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
we
didn't
go
behind
what
one
could
guess
were
the
motives
or
the
forces
behind
that
legislation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
once
you
enter
that
domain
we
are
lost.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
can
find
a
reasonable
one
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
likely
--
thought
more
of
that
tonight
if
we're
not
--
[laughs]
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
the
employee
--
must
the
employees
of
the
western
union
satisfy
this
question
as
to
what
justice
brennan
referred
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
what's
the
--
what's
the
relation
between
regulation
of
them
as
a
utility
to
the
competition
between
a
little
drugstore
that
sells
postal
telegraph
orders
and
the
big
drugstore
that
doesn't
in
it's
regard
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
you
think
it's
unreasonable,
so
unreasonable
it
is
unconstitutional
for
them
to
say,
"we
know
uncle
sam
has
trusted
its
money
business
enterprise.
we
know
new
york
has
some
oversight."
they
can't
say
that
but
if
it
were
required
to
take
out
a
utility
license
unrelated
to
this
very
business
then
it
would
be
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
banking
transactions
have
--
are
regulated
as
banking
transaction.
as
i
understood
you,
the
western
union
isn't
regulated
as
to
these
fiduciary
transaction,
it's
regulated
as
a
utility?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
i
--
then
i
misunderstood
your
answer
to
justice
brennan.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
would
prevent
the
western
union
from
licensing
drugstores
or
anything
else,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
far
as
the
statue
is
concerned,
wouldn't
it?
as
far
as
the
statute
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
concerned
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
they
could
do
their
business
to
a
drugstore?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
can
make
judicial
notice
of
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
vast
amounts
of
money
for
--
i
don't
know,
in
funds.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
no,
but
neither
does
the
western
union
in
connection
with
their
money
order.
