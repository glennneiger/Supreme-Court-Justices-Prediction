mr.
john
j.
yowell
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
john
j.
yowell
i
would
like
to
discuss
briefly
the
questions
of
--
first
of
severability.
in
the
record
at
page
532,
one
of
the
questions
presented,
the
second
question
presented
in
this
case
is
this.
if
the
exemption
of
american
express
company
money
orders
from
the
act
is
an
unconstitutional
provision,
should
the
district
court
have
held
that
the
provision
was
severable.
and
in
the
appellant's
brief
at
page
5,
they
have
substantially
the
same
statement
as
a
question
presented
to
this
court,
whether
or
not
the
district
court
should
have
determined
that
this
exemption
was
severable.
in
other
words,
the
question
is
presented
to
this
court
was
at
error
for
the
district
court
not
to
determine
that
it
was
severable.
however,
we
find
no
argument
in
this
brief
to
this
court
that
the
exemption
is
severable.
now,
that
is
a
very
important
question
because
if
this
exemption
is
severable,
then
this
law
applies
to
the
american
express
company
and
the
appellees
and
everybody
else.
that
would
be
the
effect
of
holding
this
exemption
unconstitutional
but
severable.
the
only
thing
in
the
appellant's
brief
along
that
line,
they
don't
pursue
the
question
presented
in
their
assignment
of
error
and
their
notice
of
appeal,
but
the
end
on
page
25
with
the
conclusion
that
severability
is
a
question
that
might
be
more
appropriately
left
for
adjudication
to
the
illinois
supreme
court
citing
liggett
against
lee.
now,
as
our
brief
shows
when
the
question
of
severability
comes
up
--
when
a
case
comes
up
from
a
federal
court,
the
lower
federal
court,
the
question
of
severability
may
be
determined
by
the
lower
federal
court
and
by
this
court.
it
is
when
a
case
comes
from
a
state
court
that
this
court
says
the
question
of
severability
is
more
appropriately
determined
by
the
state
court.
that
was
held
in
two
cases
in
the
238
u.s.
the
first
one
was
the
guinn
case.
the
guinn
case
came
up
from
the
lower
federal
court.
it
involved
the
validity
of
some
regulations
as
to
the
right
to
vote
and
the
statute
had
a
grandfather
clause
in
it
and
also
a
literacy
test.
and
this
court
held
that
the
grandfather
clause
was
a
discriminatory
and
a
depravation
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
it
found
that
the
literacy
test
was
not
invalid
but
it
said
they
are
so
interwoven
in
the
statute
that
we
can't
say
they
would
have
passed
the
one
without
the
other
and
so
they
said
it
is
not
severable.
and
they
said
having
come
up
for
the
lower
federal
court,
we
can
and
will
decide
it
and
they
did.
the
other
case
was
the
myers
case.
i
think
they're
right
together
in
238.
later
on,
there
was
the
dorchy
case
that
we
cited.
however,
it
was
a
state
--
a
case
from
the
state
court
and
they
stated
the
law,
cited
the
guinn
case,
myers
case,
i
think
perhaps
another
one
and
they
said
it
is
more
appropriate
when
the
case
comes
from
the
state
court
or
the
state
court
to
determine
that.
however,
whether
it
is
victim
or
whether
it
is
not,
certainly,
the
statement
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
that
the
legislature
surely
would
not
had
passed
this
statute
without
the
exemption
in
it
is
to
say
at
least
entitled
to
considerable
weight.
now,
there's
another
reason
why
we
submit
that
this
exemption
provision
is
not
severable
and
that
is
this.
it
is
in
the
definition
of
currency
exchanges,
the
term
currency
exchanges
occurs
in
17
sections
of
the
statute,
some
60
times,
i
believe,
and
when
you
change
the
definition,
you
change
the
meaning
of
17
sections
in
the
statute,
which
we
submit
is
a
reason
why
the
--
it
is
not
severable.
is
my
time
up?
mr.
john
j.
yowell
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon.
