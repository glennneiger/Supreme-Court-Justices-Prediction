suppose
illinois
had
concluded,
turned
over
all
this
business,
do
they
--
this
company,
whether
they
--
would
they
be
forbidden
(inaudible)
by
the
constitution?
suppose
they'd
decided
to
select
them
to
carry
on
that
business.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i'm
thinking
about.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
you
do
not
think
that
the
state
could
select
one
company
to
do
all
of
its
business,
to
do
all
these
kind
of
business?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i'm
not
talking
about
--
for
the
states.
suppose
they
decided
that
after
investigation
that
there's
a
lot
of
trouble
in
having
a
number
of
these
companies,
some
of
them
were
to
fly
by
night,
they
might
make
one
thing
or
another
and
they
decided
--
number
one,
they
decided
the
state
to
do
it,
could
they
do
that?
you
didn't
think
to
forbid
them
in
the
federal
constitution
from
running
the
business
themselves
that
they
won't
do
in
the
state
--
by
the
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then
--
then
suppose
it
simply
wanted
to
turn
over
--
turn
it
all
over
to
one
business.
it
might
be
pretty
bad.
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
they
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
they've
left
it
open
apparently
and
somehow
discriminated
invidiously?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
had
provided
that
no
company
should
do
that
kind
of
business
unless
it
has
$5
million
paid
in
capital
stock.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
this
type
of
business.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then,
it
gets
down
to
the
fact
that
they
have
exempted
this
one
company
which
--
suppose
theydid
it,
suppose
they'd
made
a
finding,
i
don't
think
much
of
legislative
finding
to
serve
as
a
rule.
suppose
they've
made
a
finding
that
they
did
it
because
they
had
reached
the
conclusion
that
this
company
was
reliable,
be
more
trouble
in
expense
and
cost
to
supervise
them
then
they
wanted
to
pay
out.
they
were
satisfied
with
them
anyhow.
they
were
going
to
subject
everybody
else
in
the
state
to
the
control
and
regulation
except
that
one
company.
would
that
have
made
any
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
thought
--
i
thought
it's
pretty
plain
from
the
act,
maybe
i
missed
your
view
on
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
very
good
--
a
very
good
dissent,
i
was
on
the
other
side.
it's
a
very
good
dissent.
