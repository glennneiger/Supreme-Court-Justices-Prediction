mr.

may
it
please
your
honors.
this
case
here
before
this
court
for
the
second
time
is
now
before
this
court's
--
court
on
appeal
probable
jurisdiction
having
been
noted
from
the
decision
of
a
three-judge
district
court
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois.
the
case
involves
the
constitutionality
of
the
illinois
currency
exchange
act
in
its
application
to
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
the
three-judge
district
court
has
held
the
act
unconstitutional
in
that
application
for
a
reason
that
can
be
briefly
stated
and
that
i
shall
then
address.
if
your
honors
please,
the
illinois
currency
exchange
act
regulates
after
defined
currency
exchanges.
this
much
legislative
history
is
i
think
prerequisite
to
a
clear
statement
of
the
question,
subsidy
constitutional
question,
presented
in
this
case.
in
the
1930's
with
the
closing
of
banks
in
illinois,
the
business
of
currency
exchanges
became
widespread
in
illinois
for
a
reason
that
i
don't
know
on
or
off
the
record.
they
have
been
very
much
more
popular
in
illinois
than
they
have
in
other
states.
i
don't
know
why
but
such
is
the
fact.
the
currency
exchanges
in
illinois
engaged
in
two
principle
activities
for
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
was
just
about
to
explain
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
what
the
illinois
currency
exchange
is
and
how
it
is
defined
in
the
act.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
it's
a
legislative
conception.
mr.
william
c.
wines
it
is
a
legislative
conception,
legislatively
defined
and
doesn't
correspond
to
any
ordinary
connotation
of
the
phrase
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--in
--
in
power.
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
institutions
that
i'm
now
describing.
mr.
william
c.
wines
it
has
nothing
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
it
has
nothing
to
do
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
with
foreign
exchange
or
whatsoever.
mr.
william
c.
wines
none
whatsoever.
the
name
is
misleading
and
is
unfortunate.
a
currency
exchange
in
illinois,
as
i
shall
first
describe
from
the
evidence
and
then
advert
to
the
definition,
engages
in
two
principle
activities.
one,
with
its
proprietor's
own
money,
it
cashes
checks
for
a
small
fee,
principally,
payroll
checks
and
federal,
state,
municipal,
government
checks,
pension
checks
and
other
checks
usually
not
more
than
a
few
hundred
dollars
in
amount.
second,
these
currency
exchanges,
as
i'm
now
using
the
term,
write
money
orders.
it's
important
to
explain
at
the
outset
that
these
currency
exchanges
write
money
orders
on
their
proprietor's
own
credit
and
with
their
proprietor's
own
money.
they
are
not
in
any
sense
agents
or
purveyors
of
the
money
orders
of
other
institutions
such
as
banks.
if
i
were
operating
one
of
these
currency
exchanges,
i
would
be
using
my
own
capital
such
as
it
might
be
to
finance
my
money
order
based
business.
now,
abuses
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
statute,
the
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
before
this
statute
was
enacted
in
its
earliest
form
where
--
there
have
been
amendments
but
the
provision
in
question
here
was
ingredient
in
the
virgin
text
of
the
act.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
i
could
have
done
it.
i
could
have
done
it.
just
open
the
money
order
business
and
that's
what
actually
happened.
mr.
william
c.
wines
well
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
if
it
was
bondified,
it
would
not,
an
ordinary
currency
--
currency
exchange
might
cash
a
money
order
but
i'm
now
talking
about
selling.
mr.
william
c.
wines
so
far
as
i
know
any
currency
exchange
will
cash
any
money
order
including
a
united
states
postal
money
order
and
apparently
enough,
you
can
have
more
trouble
with
that
kind
of
money
order
than
any
other
because
it
maybe
stolen,
not
because
it
isn't
good
as
originally
issued.

you
can
cash

at

your

could

almost
at
any
place
that
your
honor
can
cash

--
mr.
william
c.
wines
ordinarily,
i
suppose
most
people
cashes
their
money
orders
at
--
in
other
office
of
the
issuing
company
but
that
is
not
a
--
mr.

that
happened
all
the
time.
mr.
william

he
would
--
mr.

he
would
cash
that
money
order
and
he
could
do
it
at
any
place
that
he
could
cash
any
other
check
on
his
own

if
he
could
cash

or
a
check
given
to
him
by
a
friend
in
repayment
of
a
loan
and
his

he
would
deposit
or
cash
this
at
his

mr.
william
c.
wines
most
of
them
didn't.
this
organization
in
particular
has
some
in
indiana
and
some
in
wisconsin
and
so
far
as
i
know
none
anywhere
else.
mr.
william
c.
wines
by
this
act?
mr.
william
c.
wines
the
american
express
company
is
not
subject.
mr.
william
c.
wines
so
far
as
i
know
that
--
that
those
exemptions
aren't
involved
in
that
--
this
case,
but
i
want
to
reply
to
your
honor's
question
in
the
best
of
my
knowledge.
so
far
as
i
know,
the
only
regulation
imposed
upon
from
western
union
and
the
postal
telegraph
company
is
that
of
the
various
public
utility
commissions
to
which
they
are
subjected.
but
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
oh,
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
they
were
to
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
in
--
in
illinois,
american
express
company
is
not
regulated
by
anything
except
the
ordinary
laws
against
embezzlement
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
in
general,
so
far
as
i
know,
it
is
not.
i'll
come
to
the
utmost
that
i've
been
able
to
find
out
about
that
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i'm
not
sure
that's
the
same
american
express
company,
your
honor.
we've
looked
for
that
statute.
your
honor
mentioned
it
when
the
case
was
argued
here
before
and
we
have
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
not
been
able
to
find
it.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
correct.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that
is
correct.
i
don't
want
to
dissemble
or
minimize
that
fact
at
all.
and
so
this
--
this
question
emerges.
we
had
in
the
illinois
and
still
have
this
business
and
i
am
using
now
the
statutorily
sophisticated
term,
community
currency
exchange,
and
not
any
conventional
term
and
having
to
do
with
foreign
exchange,
which
cashes
checks
not
or
almost
--
are
not
necessarily
it's
own
for
a
fee
and
also
sells
money
orders
on
the
capital
or
credit
of
the
individual
or
occasionally
corporate
proprietors.
the
american
express
company
of
course
has
been
in
business
for
many
years,
in
fact,
since
the
year
1882.
the
community
currency
exchange
act
of
illinois
defines
community
exchange.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
read
a
few
lines
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
that
i
think
where
the
text
is
crucial.
for
the
purpose
of
this
act,
i'm
reading
from
page
50
of
the
appellant's
brief,
should
any
member
of
the
court
care
to
follow
me
as
each,
for
the
purpose
of
this
act,
“community
currency
exchange
means
any
person,
firm,
association,
partnership
or
corporation,
except
banks
incorporated
under
the
laws
of
the
state
and
national
banks
organized
pursuant
to
the
laws
of
the
united
states,
engaged
at
a
fixed
and
permanent
place
of

in
the
business
or
service
of,
and
providing
facilities
for,
cashing
checks,
drafts,
money
orders
or
any
other
evidences
of
money
acceptable
to
such

currency
exchange,
for

or

consideration,

orders,
or

or

one
or
more
of

foregoing
services.”
end
of
the
quotation,
end
of
the
exemption.
mr.
justice
douglas,
i
said
that
was
a
complete
exemption
that
i
now
appear
that
i
forgot
to
inform
you
that
mentioning
state
banks
are
also
exempt
to
the
course.
now,
your
honors
will
note
that
the
american
express
company
is
exempted
by
name.
now,
the
plaintiff
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
the
effect
of
the
text
of
the
statute,
your
honor,
as
understood
by
everybody,
the
plaintiffs,
the
defendant,
the
lower
courts
in
this
case
and
the
illinois
regulatory
authorities
in
the
industry
is
--
is
an
exemption
by
name
of
the
american
express
company.
that
is
the
sense
of
the
--
of
the
statute.
well,
i
see
the
textual
problem
that
prompted
your
honor's
question.
now,
the
plaintiffs,
who
are
three
individuals,
residents
of
illinois,
partners
and
a
fourth
individual,
who
was
at
one
time
and
seeks
again
to
be
an
agent
of
the
other
three
plaintiffs'
partnership,
filed
this
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
asserting
that
they
desire
to
go
into
the
business
of
selling
money
orders
with
their
own
capital,
and
i
shall
come
to
the
extent
of
their
capital
in
a
few
moments,
and
engage
in
competition
with
the
american
express
company,
but
charge
that
they
are
inhibited
from
engaging
in
that
desired
enterprise
by
the
admonitions
of
public
officials
that
such
business
would
violate
the
act
and
that
they
would
be
subject
to
penalties.
thereupon,
they
filed
this
suit
assailing
the
act
in
its
application
to
them
and
they
contend
that
the
exemption
of
the
american
express
company,
they
do
not
advert
to
the
expression
of
the
--
exemption
of
the
telegraph
companies
or,
of
course,
the
united
states
post
office,
but
the
exemption
of
the
american
express
company
by
name
and
not
by
some
standard
of
definition
or
statutorily
enacted
their
norm
is
an
invidious
discrimination
against
them.
they
rely,
i
believe,
principally
on
the
equal
protection
clause,
although,
they
mentioned
the
due
process
too
and
not
to
misquote
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
sir,
there
has
been
a
state
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
court
discussion
of
it.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
sir,
there
has
on
a
different
state
of
facts,
an
entirely
different
record.
but
when
the
act
was
first
attacked,
it
was
--
its
constitutionality
was
considered
on
direct
appeal
by
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
and
the
--
one
of
the
onslaughts
on
the
act
was
based
upon
the
explicit
exemption
not
only
of
the
american
express
but
in
that
case
of
the
two
telegraph
company
cases.
and
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
held
that
the
statute
including
the
exemption
was
valid
and
further
declared,
and
i
will
come
to
the
import
and
the
declaration
on
this
entirely
different
record
later,
but
the
court
in
that
case
did
declare
that
the
legislature
would
not
have
passed
the
act
but
for
the
exemption
and
that
is,
i
think,
response
with
your
honors
question.
now
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
we
think
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
said
so.
i
will
discuss
that
opinion
later,
your
honor
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
and
i
will
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
i'm
happy
to
be
interrupted
but
i
will
urge
with
a
little
more
factual
background
that
the
language
was,
if
not
a
dictum
and
i
really
don't
think
it
was
a
dictum,
nevertheless,
proceeded
from
a
record
so
different
from
this
that
it
should
not
have
been
regarded
as
binding
by
the
federal
court.
now,
the
district
court
referred
question
of
its
jurisdiction,
the
propriety
of
the
exercise
of
that
jurisdiction
to
the
merits,
and
first
entered
a
decision
of
judgment
in
which
it
declared
that
it
was
without
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
case
and
your
honors
noted
probable
jurisdiction.
your
honors
heard
this
case
last
year
and
your
honors
reversed
the
case
without
consideration
and
--
or
at
least
certainly
without
intimation
or
advertence
to
any
matter
of
the
merits,
held
that
the
district
court
had
abdicated
the
jurisdiction
that
it
did
possess
but
made
it
clear
that
your
honors
were
not
telling
the
court
whether
it
should
exercise
that
jurisdiction
or
remit
the
parties
to
the
state
court
for
a
consideration
of
the
--
both
the
federal
constitutional
questions
and
(inaudible)
of
several
ability.
pursuant
to
that
order
of
remandment
on
the
part
of
your
honors,
the
district
court,
which
is
i
have
explained,
had
previously
--
actually
heard
the
case
on
the
evidence,
entered
an
opinion
without
further
argument
or
hearing
in
which
they
held
that
they
regarded
it,
this
illinois
expression
in
the
mcdougall
case
to
which
i
--
which
i
mentioned
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
as
rendering
it
unnecessary
for
the
plaintiffs
to
repair
the
state
court
for
recourse
to
the
federal
courts,
reached
the
subsidy
of
constitutional
question
on
the
merits,
held
the
exemption,
held
the
act
of
discriminatory
as
to
the
--
in
its
application
to
the
plaintiffs.
it
did
not
undertake
to
invalidate
it
in
total
and
entered
a
declaratory
judgment
and
a
permanent
injunction
restraining
the
state
officers
from
the
act.
the
substantive
question
that
emerges,
which
i
shall
i
address
first
is
--
well,
i
think
maybe
the
fairest
way
to
state
it
is
if
i
may
just
read
three
lines
from
the
conclusion
of
--
not
our
brief
but
the
appellee's
brief.
the
appellee
says
this,
its
appellee's
own
language
in
--
in
their
conclusion
at
page
23
of
their
brief,
the
inclusion
and
the
definition
of
the
term
"community
and
currency
exchange"
of
one
who
is
“engaged
in
the
business
of
selling
or
issuing
money
orders“
coupled
with
the
exemption
by
name
of
a
concerned
and
engaged
in
that
very
business
renders
a
statute
discriminatory
and
unconstitutional.
question
-
is
that
contention
stated
in
appellee's
own
language,
one
that
should
prevail
on
this
appeal?
that
is
the
subsidy
of
constitutional
question.
now,
the
--
i
shall
come
--
and
when
i
deemed
to
be
inappropriate
time
in
my
argument,
unless
requested
to
come
sooner
by
question
from
some
member
of
the
court
to
the
united
states
supreme
court
decisions
on
which
we
rely
as
vindicating
the
general
proposition
that
exemptions
by
name
of
private
corporations
are
proper
where
the
exception
itself
is
appropriate
and
not
discriminatory.
but
first,
with
your
honor's
indulgence,
i
should
like
to
compare
or
i
should
more
preferably
say
contest
the
activities
and
operations
of
the
american
express
company
with
the
operation
of
the
plaintiffs
and
then
i
shall
come
to
the
matter
of
the
authorities
that
sanction
and
exemption
by
particular
names.
the
american
express
company,
the
record
is
replete
with
evidence
of
the
very
great
distinctions
other
than
those
of
sides
alone
between
the
american
express
company
and
the
business
that
the
plaintiffs
aspired
to
conduct
in
illinois
and
in
fact
do
conduct
in
illinois
and
wisconsin.
cardinal
among
those
distinctions
are
these
signally
differentiated
events.
american
express
company
was
founded
in
1882.
plaintiff's
business
was
not
either
born
or
conceived
in
illinois
when
this
act
was
passed,
circumstances
that
might
have
warranted
an
exception
by
the
principle
of
the
grandfather
clause
but
that's
not
primarily
relied
on
here.
american
express
company
does
business,
and
if
my
memory
serve
me
correctly,
55
foreign
countries
as
well
as
throughout
the
entire
united
states,
the
record
doesn't
show
to
what
extent
the
american
express
company
is
in
fact
subjected
to
what
might
be
called
an
official
type
of
scrutinizing
regulation
in
all
of
these
55
foreign
countries.
but
it
does
show
that
the
american
express
company
comporting
itself
and
has
for
about
three
quarters
of
a
century
comported
itself
in
such
a
manner
as
to
satisfy
not
only
the
regulatory
authorities
of
the
united
states
and
55
other
countries
but
the
established
business
institutions
that
depend
on
it.
the
record
shows,
if
your
honors
please,
that
the
american
express
company
has
on
many
occasions
and
in
many
respects
acted
as
the
fiscal
agent
for
the
united
states
government.
the
record
shows
that
the
american
express
company
has
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
banking
corporation,
which
is
regulated
and
subject
to
the
supervision
of
the
banking
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york.
it
also
shows
that
bank
is
federally
insured
and
therefore
is,
of
course,
subject
to
the
surveillance
of
the
federal
authorities.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
sir.
the
plaintiffs
concede,
the
trial
court
found,
the
evidence
shows
and
the
legislature
recognized
that
it
is
solvent.
the
statement
isn't
challenged
in
the
brief
and
it's
never
defaulted
on
obligation
and
there
is
no
question
as
to
the
features
of
the
american
express
company's
business
contained
in
or
suggested
by
the
chief
justice's
question.
now,
we
come
to
the
business
of
the
--
it's
briefly
sketched
in
our
brief
and
i'm
not
going
to
read
from
the
brief,
of
course,
but
i
shall
use
it
to
request
my
recollections.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i'm
sorry
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
don't
think
they
are.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
no,
that's
not
the
--
that's
not
the
reliance
at
all.
mr.
william
c.
wines
the
american
express
company,
the
parent
company.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
sir,
not
at
all.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
didn't
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
intend.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
did
not
intend
to
say
that
at
all,
your
honor.
i
understood
you
rather
to
ask
a
different
question.
i
understood
your
honor
to
ask
whether
the
typical
illinois
currency
exchange
before
the
act
could
be
operated
like
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
a
grocery
store
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
and
whether
as
far
as
the
illinois
law
was
concerned,
the
american
express
company
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
oh,
i
did
not
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
if
i
--
if
i
gave
that
impression,
your
honor,
i'm
very
sorry.
i
misunderstood
your
honor's
question.
i
understood
your
honor
to
ask
about
the
typical
illinois
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
currency
exchange
and
the
american
express
too,
so
far
as
illinois
is
concerned.
mr.
william
c.
wines
there
is
none,
except
the
general
laws
against
forgery
or
any
fire
ordinances
or
doing
business
with
intent
to
defraud
or
confidence
game,
the
criminal
codes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
its
subsidiary
is
regulated
by
the
state
of
new
york.
to
what
extent
the
federal
government
regulates
it,
i
don't
know.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
don't
know
of
any
law
anywhere
that
regulates
the
american
express
company's
money
order
business
in
the
sense
that
a
bank
is
regulated
or
a
building
loan
systems,
directly
.
i
don't
want
to
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
it
isn't
derailment.
mr.
william
c.
wines
it's
very
much
to
the
point.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no.
mr.
william
c.
wines
such
is
the
fact
and
such
is
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
that
is
--
that
is
the
whole
question.
mr.
william
c.
wines
so
far
as
i
know
it
does
not.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
my
associates
are
whispering
and
distracting
my
attention.
i
wish
you
could
keep
still.
now,
we
address
the
business
of
the
--
of
the
plaintiffs.
the
plaintiffs
are
three
individuals
who
have
formed
a
partnership
and
a
corporation
and
they
do
business
in
indiana
and
in
illinois.
they
imitate
the
methods
of
the
american
express
company
to
this
extent
and
to
this
extent
only.
we
can
see
the
similarities
before
we
address
the
vital
differences.
they,
like
the
american
express
company,
have
agents
working
in
grocery
stores
or
drugstores.
these
agents
are
empowered
to
sign
the
names
of
the
plaintiffs
or
their
firm
as
the
author
and
responsible
maker
of
money
orders
and
they
keep
a
bank
account.
any
american
express
does
and
company
does
all
of
those
things
and
the
plaintiffs
do
all
of
those
things.
but
now,
we
don't
rely
on
the
size
alone
but
let's
take
size.
impressing
figures
are
recapitulated
on
page
--
at
pages
12
and
--
and
13
of
the
briefs.
the
plaintiffs
sell
a
type
of
money
order,
and
now
when
i
say
sell,
i
mean
do
sell
in
indiana
and
wisconsin,
and
have
sold
in
test
cases
and
seek
to
sell
regularly
in
illinois
money
orders,
which
are
called
bondified.
that's
a
coined
name,
bondified
money
orders.
they
represent
to
the
public
that
they
are
licensed
and
bondified.
actually,
when
you
take
their
depositions
and
asked
them
what
license
they
hold,
community
currency
exchanges
in
illinois
are
licensed,
they
say
that
the
license
they
hold
is
not
from
the
state
of
illinois,
the
state
of
wisconsin,
the
state
of
indiana
or
any
other
states
but
it
is
a
trade
name
license
to
use
the
trade
name
bondified
which
is
a
registered
trade-mark
or
trade
name
and
who
owns
the
registration
and
grants
this
license,
which
is
not
like
a
license
to
drive
an
automobile
but
it's
like
a
license
from
me
to
come
on
my
property.
a
company
or
known
as
checks
incorporated
whose
principle
business
is
to
own
this
trade-mark
or
trade
name,
license
its
use,
permit
the
licensees
to
represent
to
the
public
that
they
are
licensed
would
we
say
the
clear
connotation
that
it's
some
kind
of
a
governmental
license.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
there
are
a
number
of
them
in
the
record.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
and
on
page
244a.
mr.
william
c.
wines
444,
no,
just
44a,
justice
whittaker.
mr.
william
c.
wines
to
this
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
william
c.
wines
to
this
extent,
your
honor,
we
are
concerned
with
whether
there
is
a
valid
basis
for
differentiating
between
the
american
--
way
the
american
express
company
does
business
and
the
way
the
plaintiffs
do
business.
mind
you
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
my
--
that,
of
course,
is
really
a
statement
of
the
only
subsidy
of
constitutional
question
here
and
this
is
my
answer
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
your
honors
please.
we
say
that
the
distinction
is
vindicated
by
the
actualities
of
the
business
and
not
by
the
mere
words
of
the
statute.
mr.
william
c.
wines
with
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
with
respect
to
the
need
for
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
particular
regulation.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
c.
wines
we
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i'm
not
quite
sure,
your
honor
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
that
i
understand.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
did
say
that
and
i
meant
that.
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
your
honor,
it's
sad
that
your
honor
wasn't
using
classification
in
the
legal
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
(voice
overlap)
and
if
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
and
if
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
i
don't
want
to
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
true
and
these
--
and
the
plaintiffs
and
the
american
express
company
are,
of
course,
in
the
same
class
or
there'd
be
no
need
for
the
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
right.
that's
correct
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
and
if
i
give
--
if
i
--
yes,
sir.
and
if
i
gave
a
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
in
every
respect?
mr.
william
c.
wines
this
statute
would
be
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
discriminatory.
mr.
william
c.
wines
it
would
be
--
it
would
--
the
statute
would
--
if
--
if
bondified
were
an
exact
duplicate,
a
complete
replica
of
american
express
company,
the
statute
would
apply
to
bondified,
it
would
not
apply
to
american
express
company.
and
therefore,
it
would
be
discriminatory
and
unconstitutional
and
we
would
not
say
otherwise.
mr.
william
c.
wines
doing
business.
mr.
william
c.
wines
exactly.
mr.
william
c.
wines
exactly.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
what
i
understood
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
what
i
understood
mr.
chief
justice
brennan
to
mean
and
i
see
him
nodding.
mr.
william
c.
wines
oh,
that's
the
whole
point.
mr.
william
c.
wines
they
are
certainly
in
the
same
class
to
this
extent.
they're
both
selling
money
orders
with
their
own
cash.
mr.
william
c.
wines
they're
both
doing
it
through
agents
in
grocery
stores,
drugstores,
department
stores
and
i
don't
know
what
other
kind
of
places.
now,
to
that
extent
they
are
in
the
same
class
and
if
that
is
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
meant
by
the
same
class,
certainly
what
i
meant.
mr.
william
c.
wines
you
mean
with
its
same
financial
apparatus?
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
say,
no.
i
say
the
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
no.
mr.
william
c.
wines
they
would
have
it
except
for
this
fact,
except
for
this
fact.
if
the
statute
were
given
its
--
its
effect,
now,
here's
where
--
here's
where
i
misunderstood
you.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
wish
you
would.
mr.
william
c.
wines
if
your
honor
please,
i
understand
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
but
if
the
act
were
given
its
effect,
it
would
still
apply.
but
we
say,
and
this
is
vital
and
crucial
to
the
argument,
that
until
the
time
comes
when
the
exception
becomes
unfounded
in
reality,
the
exception
is
valid.
suppose
if
i
understand
your
--
i
understood
something
about
tables
that
are
being
reversed.
suppose
that
overnight,
american
express
were
to
shrink
to
a
duplicate
of
what
bondified
is
now
and
over
the
same
night
bondified
were
to
expand
to
american
express,
the
hypothesis
is
grotesque
but
it
does
make
the
--
the
--
it
does
point
up
to
the
problem.
the
statute
we
say
would
still
contain
an
exception
in
favor
of
american
express
company,
would
contain
none
for
bondified
but
would,
thereupon,
become
discriminatory
and
unconstitutional
and
we
would
not
suggest
otherwise.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
don't
this
so,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that
involves
a
construction
of
the
statute.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
think
it's
so
plain,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
if
it's
not
plain
--
if
it's
not
plain,
then
it
involves
the
construction
of
the
question
but
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
me
to
give
him
my
response.
mr.
william
c.
wines
possibly,
you're
right.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i'll
answer
your
question
--
your
honor's
question
as
i
--
as
best
i
understand
it
and
as
best
i
can.
i
don't
say
that
for
this
exemption
to
become
discriminatory
that
a
competitor
would
have
to
duplicate
it
exactly
in
all
particulars
of
course.
but
i
would
have
to
say
that
they
would
have
to
be
so
substantially
comparable
that
it
would
appear
captious
and
arbitrary
law
that
would
distinguish
between.
now,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
if
your
honors
please,
i
don't
want
to
misrepresent
the
appellee's
position
and
if
i
misapprehend
their
briefs,
which
is
plausible,
i
think,
i
want
them
to
correct
it.
but
as
i
understand
them,
their
only
argument
and
certainly
their
chief
argument
is
that
if
you
have
enacted
a
set
of
standards
in
generic
terms,
any
corporation,
i
would
say
you'd
have
to
get
all
of
these
factors
in
but
get
cardinal
features
in,
engaged
in
the
international
business
of
writing
money
orders,
having
a
half
a
billion
dollars
in
free
assets,
which
american
express
company
does,
having
been
in
business
for
50
years,
american
express
company's
history
is
longer
than
that.
and
perhaps
adding
other
ingredients,
which
i
don't
think
would
be
necessary.but
he
put
in
generic
terms,
so
that
if
american
express
company
withers
and
its
assets
fall
below
this
half
a
billion
or
a
quarter
of
a
billion
or
whatever
amount,
put
an
amount
many
times
or
anything
that
the
--
that
the
plaintiffs
have
or
them,
american
express
company,
would
automatically
be
excluded
because
it
would
now
have
ceased
to
comply
like
the
taverns.
they
open
after
hours
or
the
bank
whose
assets
become
invariable.
on
the
other
hand,
bondified
could
achieve
the
quarter
of
a
billion
assets
or
half
a
billion
assets
or
whatever
figure
was
taken
could
achieve
50
years
or
20
years
of
continuous
business,
could
do
so
that
it
would
be
a
matter
of
definition.
what
they
object
to
principally
if
not
exclusively
is
the
exempting
of
american
express
company
by
name.
they
argued
that
we
don't
know
no
matter
what
american
express
company's
virtues
maybe
today.
i
go
and
sell
them
to
big
company's
hand.
it
--
it
may
fail
or
at
least
may
verge
upon
themselves.
they
say
that
it
has
been
baptized
and
salvation
is
there
no
matter
what
it
does
from
now
on
and
that's
the
way
we
--
they
read
the
statute.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
true.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
true
in
the
community.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
true.
mr.
william
c.
wines
mr.
chief
justice,
i
--
i
have
to
confess
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
understand
your
question.
mr.
william
c.
wines
to
answer
your
honor's
question
as
candidly
as
i
can,
i
think
in
the
manner
of
the
liquor
business,
you
couldn't
because
they
just
can't
imagine
an
actual
state
of
affairs
where
a
--
a
--
when
--
when
liquor
is
concern,
it
could
be
so
prepotent
in
its
--
in
its
soundness
as
to
justify
it.
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
if
you
could.a
pawnbroker's
business,
i
can
imagine
a
--
a
pawnbroker's
business
so
well
established
of
dimensions
of
the
size,
i
will
put
it
this
way.
if
you
could
cast
a
statutory
concept
which
would
exempt
this
from
regulation
at
all,
you
could
do
it
by
name
and
wouldn't
have
to
do
it
by
--
by
standards.
for
instance,
banks
in
new
york
and
i
may
be
wrong
about
this,
but
at
least
it
was
a
law
at
one
time
that
certain
types
of
banks
that
didn't
take
deposits
of
less
than
$7000
were
free
from
most
of
the
new
york
banking
regulations.
now,
if
there
had
been
only
one
such
bank
and
you
would
pick
it
out
by
name,
i
would
say
it
makes
no
difference
whether
you
do
it
by
using
the
name
or
by
using
some
euphemistic
artifice
of
--
of
classification.
now,
that
is
the
whole
crux
and
point
of
the
case,
mr.
chief
justice
and
your
honors.
i
think
you
have
done
it.
but
pursuing
your
honors
question,
i
can
tell
you
some
--
i
could
give
you
some
examples
where
they
have
done
that
but
not
quite
the
liquor
and
maybe
not
what
you
either
would
call
a
pawnshop.
but
the
illinois
blue
sky
law,
which
has
not
been
passed
upon
by
this
court,
but
which
has
reaches
far
beyond
illinois
in
its
effect,
although,
exempts
by
name
from
its
very
vigorous
application,
all
securities
listed
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
the
new
york
stock
exchange
is
a
private
organization,
it
isn't
even
incorporated
and
illinois
can't
even
send
an
inspector
to
the
new
york
stock
exchange
to
see
if
they're
complying
with
fire
laws
because
it
isn't
in
new
york.
we
have
no
control
over
it,
not
even
the
control
that
we
have
over
zoning
ordinances.
yet,
nobody
questions,
nobody
challenges
the
exemption
from
the
illinois
blue
sky
law
of
securities
of
private
corporations,
i'm
not
talking
about
public
offerings
from
the
illinois
blue
sky
law
as
long
as
they're
listed
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
oh,
i
think
there
are
few
restrictions
even
as
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
but
it
isn't
by
the
state
and
it
isn't
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
and
--
but
my
point
is
it's
by
name.
if
there's
an
exchange
in
california
that's
just
as
highly
regulated,
there
is
no
exemption
for
it.
there
is
for
a
few
other
exchanges,
including
the
illinois
board
of
trade.
i
think
maybe
--
i
think
the
boston
stock
exchange
is
exempted
too.
i
know
several
stock
exchanges
are
exempt
and
they
are
exempt
by
name.
now
--
but
i
would
like
before
i
conclude
to
--
to
call
your
honors
attention
very
briefly
to
some
very
important
cases
in
which
exemption
by
name
has
been
upheld.
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
your
honor,
perhaps
i
didn't
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
they
said
that.
we
say
that
they
said
it
on
a
different
record.
my
time
is
running
and
the
record
in
this
case
makes
a
very
convincing
demonstration
from
this
plaintiff's
own
evidence
that
this
law
is
necessary
and
a
court
considering
that
same
question
in
light
of
the
record
in
this
case
might
have
very
well
concluded
and
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
i
think,
might
very
well
conclude
on
this
record
that
there's
such
urgency
for
the
regulation
of
money
order
business
in
illinois
that
if
they
have
to
subject
american
express
company
to
the
same
regulation,
they
subject
plaintiff's
and
other
currency
exchange
operators,
they
would
have
done
so.
and
one
of
the
points
that's
urged
in
this
brief
and
i
urge
it
not
for
less
strongly
because
i
urge
it
briefly.
it's
very
simply
argued
then
there's
no
use
in
spending
the
court's
in
my
time
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
think,
your
honor
--
with
all
due
respect
to
your
honor,
i
think
that
even
though
i
can
vindicate
illinois,
the
reasonableness
of
illinois
legislation
on
facts
that
they
couldn't
possibly
have
known
if
it
is
in
fact
reasonable.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that
that
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
right.
now,
we
say
that
the
question
of
severability,
although
it
was
--
it
was
the
subject
of
an
expression
by
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
is
one
that
when
you
read
the
lower
court,
the
lower
court
says,
and
this
is
important,
but
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
had
to
have
before
the
materials
that
we
have
and
they
--
they
were
talking
not
about
reasonableness
but
about
severability.
and
they
said,
the
question
is
a
different
one
on
this
record
from
what
it
was
in
the
illinois
record
and
if
that's
so
i
think
it
ought
to
go
back
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
from
the
logic
of
the
very
opinion
that's
appealed
from
here.
i
don't
think
the
plaintiff's
should
be
allowed
to
have
it
both
ways
to
argue
as
they
did
successfully,
not
only
persuasively
but
successfully.
the
illinois
supreme
court
didn't
have
your
honors
or
mr.
district
judge's
in
illinois
the
materials
that
we
have
before
it.
if
they
had,
they
would
have
reached
a
different
conclusion.
but
nevertheless
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
they
might
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
just
this,
the
question
arises
as
to
whether
or
not
this
court
or
the
district
court
should
have
decided
it
at
all
or
should
have
remitted
the
parties
to
the
state
courts
under
the
teachings
of
the
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
have
been
here,
your
honor?
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
sir.
oh,
no.
your
honor
didn't
--
your
honor's
memory
is
--
is
at
(inaudible)
mr.
william
c.
wines
certainly,
you
--
you
expressly
said
that
they
--
they
had
jurisdiction
but
that
you
were
not
telling
them
whether
to
decide
it
on
the
merits
or
remit
it
to
the
--
the
state
court.
now,
just
--
just
a
second
here.
mr.
william
c.
wines
what?
mr.
william
c.
wines
the
last
sentence
in
--
the
judgment
below
was
reversed
and
the
cause
remanded
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings
not
--
inconsistent
with
this
opinion.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
right.
your
honor
said
there
was
jurisdiction
but
now
look.
may
i
--
may
i
--
mr.
justice
douglas,
we
need
not
decide
the
extent
of
the
district
court's
discretionary
power
to
deny
remission
since
in
any
event,
that's
remission
to
the
state
court,
since
in
any
event,
we
think
there
was
no
occasion
for
its
exercise
here.
the
very
purpose
of
proscribing
in
detail
in
this
statute
of
type
of
inquiry
made
is
to
avoid
uncertainty
over
the
extent
of
investigation
necessarily
for
the
next
--
that's
--
that's
the
law.
it's
not
dead.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
think
that's
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
the
question
is
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
think
that's
what
your
honors
can
do
and
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
you
have
a
state
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
have
a
state
question.
mr.
justice
douglas,
i
did
read
the
wrong
language
but
the
language
i
meant
to
read
was
this.
we
hold
that
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
of
this
cause.
it
was
error
to
dismiss
the
complaint
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
is
vacated
and
the
cause
is
remanded
to
what
we
do
not
now
decide
what
procedure
it
is
the
court
should
follow
on
remand.
i
take
that
to
mean,
your
honor,
that
it
was
at
large
just
so
they
weren't
under
the
misapprehension
that
they
couldn't
act.
may
i
reserve
any
time
that
i
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
wish
to
reply
but
i
made
an
--
i
made
a
misleading
answer
to
a
question
by
mr.
justice
brennan
and
i
would
like
to
correct
it.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
told
mr.
justice
brennan
that
the
act
limited
the
number
of
agency
in
a
given
locality
in
accordance
with
the
finding
of
needs
of
the
community.
on
reflection
and
recollection,
that
was
done
by
an
amendment
to
the
act
which
was
not
in
the
original
act
and
not
before
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
when
the
--
they
expressed
approval
of
the
exemption.
mr.
william
c.
wines
unless
it
should
be
held
that
the
--
it
was
the
amendment
to
the
act
and
not
the
original
act
that
was
unconstitutional,
the
amendment
limiting
the
number.
that
is
the
important
correction
that
i
wanted
to
make.
i
don't
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
want
to
argue
--
i
appreciate
it.
