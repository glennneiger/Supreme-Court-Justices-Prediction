justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
section
contains
the
exception?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
section
1?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
is
this
the
company
exempted
by
name
or
does
it
just
prohibit
any
(inaudible)
ordinance?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
444.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
is
that
question
open
here?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then,
if
it
is
open,
then
does
not
the
statute
make
a
classification
of
a
particular
type
of
security
that
is
exempted?
that
was
the
significance
of
my
original
question
to
mr.
wines.
if
it's
true,
as
the
statute
says,
it
is
not
american
express
company
by
name
that
it's
exempt
but
that's
a
standard
to
use
to
identify
a
particular
security
that
is
need
not
be
registered,
that's
exempt.
now,
i'm
not
sure
i'm
making
myself
clear
to
you.
does
the
state
of
illinois
have
the
right
to
establish
a
class
--
a
kind
of
security
which
it
may
exempt?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
