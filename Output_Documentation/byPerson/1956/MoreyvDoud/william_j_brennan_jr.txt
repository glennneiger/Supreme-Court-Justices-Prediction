justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
now,
where
--
where
would
one
cash
a
money
order
of
this
kind?
as
i
understand
it
ordinarily,
either
western
union
or
american
express
or
that
kind
of
money
order,
you
go
to
--
pay
goes
to
the
--
an
office
of
one
of
those
organizations
somewhere
else,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
but
ordinarily
don't
you
take
them
into
a
western
union
office
and
get
them
cashed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
no,
what
--
what
happened
with
these?
how
are
these
marketed?
if
--
if
one
were
issued,
for
example,
in
illinois
and
the
payee
was
someone
in
ohio.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
what
--
where
would
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
someone
--
where
would
the
payee
take
it
to
get
it
cashed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
this
organization
maintained
no
offices,
i
gather,
outside
or
any
of
these
who's
outside
of
illinois?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
do
i
understand
it
correctly
that
the
postal
telegraph
and
western
union
that
this
aspect,
the
money
order
aspect
to
their
businesses,
is
a
regulated
--
are
regulated
by
--
is
regulated
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no.
isn't
it
generally
regulated
by
someone
either
a
federal
agency
or
a
state
agency,
perhaps
both?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
the
american
express
but
what
about
western
union
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
that
public
utilities
regulation
includes
their
money
order
business
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
american
express
is
not
regulated
by
any
agency,
federal
or
state.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
on
this
record
then,
is
this
a
problem
of
a
statute
which
regulates
some
of
these
money
order
concerns
but
omits
to
regulate
the
american
express,
which
itself
is
unregulated
in
this
business.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
--
has
there
ever
been
a
state
court
interpretation
of
that
exemption?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
has
there
been
one
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
has
there
--
has
there
been
one,
which
has
said
that
the
statute
is
--
that
the
exemption
is
valid?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i
--
what
i
had
in
mind
was
whether
the
statute
might
otherwise
stand
that
the
exemption
was
stricken
down
but
i
gather
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
you
tell
me
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
has
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
don't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
do
not
let
me
interrupt
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
know
specifically
whether
its
money
order
business
is
regulated?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
wines
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
wines,
suppose
--
suppose
bondified
were
an
exact
duplicate
of
american
express.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
every
respect.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
the
statute
apply?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
the
statute
apply?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
suppose
tomorrow
american
express
would've
carry
on
business
just
the
way
you
say
bondified
is
carrying
it
on.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
suppose
that
we're
doing
exactly
what
bondified
is
doing
all
right
with
the
same
financial
apparatus.
in
other
words,
suppose
the
tables
were
turned
here,
would
american
express
have
the
benefit
of
the
exemption
under
this
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
would
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
the
statute
expressly
says
that
american
express
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
my
question
is
simple.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'd
like
you
to
answer
it.
the
exception
is
for
american
express.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
if
american
express
company
were
carrying
on
business
the
way
bondified
is
carrying
on
business,
precisely
the
same
way,
would
this
exception
apply?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
wines,
tell
me,
is
there
any
relation
to
the
problem
of
sections
4.1
and
4.2
at
page
54,
which
is
as
i
read
them,
do
not
permit
the
location
of
one
of
these
exchanges,
except
as
an
affirmative
determination
by
the
licensing
authority
whether
that
location
in
terms
of
the
needs
of
the
community
for
such
exchanges
is
needed
in
the
interest
--
public
interest
or
convenience,
i
think,
the
statutory
language
is?
now,
do
i
read
this
correctly
that
the
american
express
company
can
locate
any
number
of
offices
or
any
number
of
community
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
without
a
determination
whether
there's
any
need
for
that
office
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
whereas
none
of
these
exchanges
may,
except
as
this
been
that
determination?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
they
can
also
get
it,
i
gather,
without
this
determination
whether
that
outlet
will
or
will
not
promote
the
convenience
that
that
is
in
the
community,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
mean
this
for
example
that
they
may
move
in
and
establish
outlets
and
then
bondified
assuming
it
could
otherwise
qualify
for
a
license,
might
yet
be
denied
a
license
for
a
particular
location
in
a
given
community
because
where
so
many
american
express
outlets
are
already
operating
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
suggesting
that
the
locations
also
have
to
be
licensed
under
this
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
the
local
drugstore
has
to
be
licensed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
american
express
outlet,
drugstore,
for
example,
would
not
have
to
get
a
license.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whereas
the
bondified
drugstore
might
be
a
better
drugstore,
bigger
drugstore
and
more
responsible
and
everything
else
it
has
to
know.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
excuse
me.
before
you
get
to
that,
would
you
mind
telling
me
at
page
53
of
the
appellant's
brief
dealing
with
the
application,
which
has
to
be
filed
for
a
license,
he
has
to
contain
certain
information.
am
i
right
that
the
local
drugstore
that
wants
to
sell
money
order
would
have
to
file
an
application
if
he's
within
the
act,
that
is
selling
anything
but
american
express
money
order?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
right?
and
he
has
to
include
in
it
in
the
application
whether
he's
ever
been
involved
in
any
civil
or
criminal
--
criminal
litigation
and
material
facts
whether
he
has
ever
been
committed
to
any
people
or
institution
or
admitted
to
an
institution
for
the
care
and
treatment
of
mentally
ill
person,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
if
in
fact,
he
is
selling
american
express
money
orders
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
even
if
he
has
been
involved
in
civil
or
criminal
litigation,
even
if
he
has
been
committed
to
a
penal
institution
or
to
an
insane
asylum,
he
may
sell
it,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
mr.
yowell,
was
there
a
reason
you
selected
the
exemption
from
--
for
american
express
and
did
not
point
at
the
western
union
or
the
postal
telegraph
and
the
other
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
under
public
utility
regulation
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
it
--
is
it
actually
regulated
then
in
respect
to
them
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
i
don't
mean
that
it
may
be
but
is
it
in
fact
regulated
as
to
its
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
money
order
business?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
one
other
question.
in
these
drugstores
which
are
the
outlet
both
for
american
express
and
bondified,
are
western
union
money
orders
sold?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no?
are
they
selling
them
from
their
own
places
of
business?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
appreciate
but
i
mean
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
you
get
a
money
order
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
but
you
get
that
at
--
at
a
western
union
place
of
business
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
about
united
states
money
orders?
those
aren't
sold
except
at
post
offices,
are
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
just
want
to
know
what
the
fact
was.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
it
would
still
be
true,
would
it
not,
that
if
american
express
company
locations
in
a
given
community
where
they
give
a
number
sufficient
that
no
more
locations
by
american
express
or
anyone
else
ought
to
be
in
that
community,
bondified
even
if
it
otherwise
qualified
under
the
statute
could
not
get
a
license
to
locate
in
that
community.
