mr.
g.
kent
yowell
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
the
constitutional
issue
and
the
issue
of
clean
hands,
which
has
been
adverted
to.
and
my
father
will
touch
on
the
severability
and
the
irreparable
injury
issue
that
is
presented
here.
he
also
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
i
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
i
don't.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
that
is
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
--
that
is
the
thing.
yes,
sir.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
well,
i
--
i
could
only
say
that
that
is
a
question
of
fact
which
has
been
decided
in
our
favor
by
the
district
court
and
it
--
it
does
not
clearly
drawn
here.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
mr.
justice
whittaker
asked
mr.
wines
about
the
--
the
way
this
exemption
comes
in.
and
i
think
mr.
wines
said
that
was
a
textual
distinction
but
i
think
it
is
more
than
that.
the
american
express
company
is
not
exempted,
except
insofar
as
it
engages
solely
in
the
business
of
selling
its
money
orders.
banks,
on
the
other
hand,
are
exempted
whether
they
sell
money
orders
or
cash
checks.
the
statute
is
directed
towards
the
local
person,
the
outlet
of
the
money
order
company.
we
have
a
partnership
which
is
engaged
in
establishing
outlets
through
retail
establishments
in
illinois,
local
drugstores
and
grocery
stores.
that
is
the
same
manner
that
american
express
company
establishes
outlets
but
the
--
and
the
american
express
company
can
get
an
outlet
without
having
their
outlet
pay
a
license
fee
or
be
regulated
or
be
prohibited
from
selling
over
the
counter
in
retail
stores.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
yes,
your
honor.
they
are
absolutely
out
of
the
act
by
definition.
they
are
the
people
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
yes,
your
honor,
even
though
bondified
satisfied
the
state
auditor
that
it
was
financially
responsible,
paid
all
the
investigative
fees
and
licenses.
it
--
that
--
that
one
thing
could
keep
it
out
if
the
--
the
community
were
saturated
with
american
express
company
outlets.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
there
is
--
there
is
none.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
there
is
none.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
well,
yes,
your
honor.
except
the
--
the
profit
motive
may
have
it
--
be
more
particular
as
to
where
it
establishes
agencies.
it
wouldn't
want
to
have
its
own
agencies
swamp
each
other.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
yes,
it
could
do
it.
there's
nothing
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
--
to
prevent
it.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
now,
mr.
wines
indicated
that
this
--
the
history
of
this
went
back
to
the
30's.
actually,
the
--
the
money
order
business
has
been
going
on
at
least
as
long
as
the
american
express
company
has
been
selling
money
orders
since
1882.
so
the
business
of
selling
money
orders
and
not
engaging
in
cash
and
check
is
an
old
business.
the
bondified
systems
do
not
cash
checks
and
that
is
the
distinction
between
this
case
and
mcdougall
versus
lueder.
and
that
is
the
--
the
illinois
case
upholding
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
of
the
--
that
distinction
was
recognized
in
the
three-judge
court
in
wisconsin,
currency
services
versus
matthews.
they
said
that
a
class
of
people
that
cash
checks
and
sell
money
orders
is
different
than
a
class
that
just
sells
money
orders.
here,
however,
and
in
the
wisconsin
case,
we
have
only
one
class,
the
class
of
people
who
sell
money
orders
through
retail
establishments.
that
one
class
is
all
that
is
involved
and
the
outlets
of
the
american
express
company
are
exempted.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
no,
your
honor.
that
would
be
--
that
may
have
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
--
a
reasonable
relationship
to
the
legislative
purpose.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
well,
i
--
if
they
were
having
a
capital,
having
assets
exceeding
liabilities
by
a
million
dollars
is
--
bears
a
reasonable
relationship
to
the
legislative
purpose
and
that
i
think
is
the
question
that
--
that
has
to
be
decided.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
yes
-
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
but
does
that
authorize
the
exemption
of
these
local
people?
do
they
have
to
--
why
are
they
exempt?
they
are
the
--
in
other
words,
why
do
they
have
to
--
to
satisfy
the
state
auditor
that
they
are
morally
and
financially
responsible?
why
do
they
have
to
have
a
performance
bond
and
a
certain
amount
of
cash
on
hand?
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
well,
neither
do
the
people
who
sell
american
express
company
money
orders
that
are
the
local
people.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
oh,
that
is
all
it
is,
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
that
is
what
this
act
licenses,
the
local
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
--
operator.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
that
is
it.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
i
--
i
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
well,
the
--
your
honor,
the
--
the
securities
themselves
are
not
the
subject
of
the
regulation
here.
it
is
the
person
selling
those
securities.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
i
might
point
out
that
one
of
the
appellees
in
this
case
is
the
local
agent
of
the
partnership.
he
is
a
druggist
named,
derek.
now,
under
the
statute,
he
has
to
be
licensed
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
is
prohibited
from
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
license
--
he
has
to
be
licensed
to
be
a
community
currency
exchange
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
the
credit
of
a
partnership.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
you
can
buy
an
american
express
company.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
that
--
it
would
be
the
american
express
company.
it
would
be
behind
that.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
unless
you
are
concerned
with
what
this
local
agent
might
do
if
he
is
careless
with
the
--
with
the
paper
if
he
is
--
if
he
is
careless
with
the
american
express
money
orders.
if
he
is
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
he
might
do
that
and
then
american
express
money
--
company
would
not
pay
those
money
orders.
and
that's
in
the
record,
your
honor,
that
the
--
the
only
money
orders
that
there
is
any
evidence
in
the
record
of
not
having
been
paid
are
american
express
company
money
orders.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
yes.
they
--
they
can
assume
that.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
but
are
they
--
have
they
--
are
they
given
the
--
the
--
are
they
thinking
of
the
american
express
company
and
making
that
a
reasonable
--
does
that
have
a
reasonable
relation
to
the
legislative
purpose
of
license
--
licensing
the
local
person?
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
i
--
i'd
like
to
talk
about
the
american
express
company
because
we
have
said
it
is
of
large
organization.
it
is
a
joint
stock
association.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
yes,
your
honor
and
he
couldn't
do
it
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
that
is
correct.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
it
doesn't
make
any
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
that
is
correct.
and
that
is
the
legislative
purpose.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
i
--
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
if
they
--
if
they
had
intended
to
do
that.
i
--
maybe
your
honors
are
thinking
of
the
slaughter-house
cases.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
in
that
case,
the
people
challenging
the
statute,
of
course,
with
the
butchers,
but
they
weren't
prevented
from
carrying
on
their
butchering
occupation
because
the
statute
creating
the
--
the
slaughter-house,
a
state
corporation,
the
charter,
provided
that
those
--
they
had
to
maintain
a
place
for
those
butchers
to
carry
on
their
business.
but
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
well,
business
for
states
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
well,
i
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
i
--
i
think
they
really
could,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
they
did
that
here.
they
--
they
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
i
think
it's
perfectly
clear
because
if
they
had
intended
to
give
the
american
express
company
which
had
no
relationship
to
the
state
of
illinois
in
anyway,
no
licensing,
no
regulation,
does
not
carry
on
an
express
business
in
illinois,
which
would
have
brought
into
the
regulation.
if
they
had
intended
to
do
that,
they
would
have
exempted
the
american
express
company
along
with
the
banks.
but
the
american
express
company
is
not
exempt
along
with
the
banks
because
if
it
sells
in
the
other
money
orders
or
if
it
carries
on
any
other
business
or
if
its
agents
carry
on
any
other
business,
check-cashing
business,
they
must
be
licensed.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
no
company
should
engage
in
the
business
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
--
of
issuing
money
orders
through
retail
establishments.
i
--
i
think
that
might
have
a
reasonable
relationship
to
the
legislative
purpose
of
protecting
the
public.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
i
think
--
i
think
it
might
have
if
they
had
gone
that
far.
i
would
--
i
--
the
point
i'm
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
i
thought
it's
pretty
plain
from
the
act
whatever
they
said
or
whatever
that
language
they
may
have
used
for
the
purpose
of
--
to
some
extent
concealing
that
they
wanted
the
american
express
to
be
free
from
this
regulation.
in
this
conclusion,
they
didn't
want
them
to
be
regulated.
they
want
to
regulate
everybody
else.
is
that's
what
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
well,
that's
--
that's
where
the
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
--
illinois
supreme
court
had
used
it.
it
--
the
illinois
supreme
court
said,
"here
we
have
the
local
currency
operator
on
the
one
hand
and
the
american
express
company,
a
large
solvent
organization
on
the
other
hand.
“they
obviously
didn't
want
to
bring
that
company
into
the
regulative
picture
but
that
opinion
overlooked
the
fact
that
this
is
a
statute
directed
to
the
local
person
selling
the
--
the
money
orders.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
i
was
--
i
was
going
to
suggest
that
--
that
its
own
dispensary
corporation
would
be
regulated
by
it.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
we
have
public
officers
carrying
on
the
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
yes,
your
honor
and
i'm
reminded
of
chief
justice
rutledge's
comparison
in
the
new
orleans
pilot
case
in
his
dissent,
which
i'm
not
--
i
don't
rely
on
but
i
--
i
just
think
it's
a
good
illustration
where
he
said
that
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
well,
i
don't
know
that
--
mr.
justice
black,
if
you
would
have
dissented
from
this
illustration
and
that
is
that
suppose
that
new
orleans
decided
that
--
that
the
only
--
the
members
of
john
smith's
family
could
be
river
pilots,
officers
of
the
state
of
new
orleans.
and
suppose
further
that
those
members
have
been
pilots
for
generations
that
would
be
an
invidious
discrimination.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
no,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
yes,
sir.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
i
--
i
didn't
intend
to
do
that.
i
meant
to
--
to
make
an
illustration
mr.
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
the
--
the
pilots
law
will
assume
that
they
had
--
they
were
fine
pilots
and
they've
been
pilots
for
generations.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
oh,
we
--
we
recognize
that
a
--
an
exemption
by
name
alone
is
not
bad.
you
--
you
can
exempt
a
railroad
from
taxation
and
that
has
a
reasonable
relation
to
a
legislative
purpose
because
the
railroads
--
one
railroad
runs
in
a
different
place
and
another
railroad
or
maybe
that
railroad
is
in
financial
difficulty
and
you
need
to
maintain
it.
the
point
--
the
presumption,
of
course,
is
that
the
legislative
determination
was
reasonable
but
this
record
shows
that
it
was
unreasonable.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
because
there
was
no
relationship
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
well,
your
honor,
the
american
express
company
maybe
large
but
it
is
not
in
illinois.
it
is
not
licensed
from
illinois
and
the
government
surveillance
is
only
in
relation
to
its
foreign
operations
where
the
--
where
the
money
is
deposited
in
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
i'd
like
to
have
my
father
pursue
the
argument.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
you
--
you
may,
mr.
yowell.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
thank
you,
your
honor.
this
record
shows,
if
the
court
please,
that
we
are
dealing
with
the
sale
of
money
orders,
small
money
orders
from
one
cent
to
$100.
neither
american
express
company
nor
these
appellees
ever
sells
a
money
order
for
more
than
$100.
mr.
smith,
the
executive
vice-president
of
the
american
express
company
testified
in
this
case
that
the
average
amount
of
money
orders
sold
by
american
express
company
is
in
the
neighborhood
of
$15,
that's
the
average
size.
this
is
obviously
not
something
that
is
peculiar
to
illinois.
all
over
the
united
states,
you
see
ads
in
the
paper,
full-page
ads.
they
don't
tell
you
how
much
things
are
anymore.
they
tell
you
how
much
a
week
it
is
and
many
people
don't
have
bank
accounts
and
that
accounts
for
the
great
growth
in
--
in
the
credit,
the
transmission
of
credit,
the
little
folks
that
have
to
send
money
orders
because
they
don't
have
bank
accounts.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
not
any
real
difference
except
this.
these
appellees'
money
orders
are
orders
on
a
bank
just
like
a
bank
check.
they
have
an
account
in
the
bank,
special
account
to
cover
these
money
orders.
it
comes
in
to
the
bank,
the
bank
pays
automatically.
theoretically,
i
suppose
that
they
wish
they
could
call
up
and
stop
payment
on
a
particular
order
but
that
it
have
to
be
pretty
quick
about
it
because
they
get
right
into
the
bank,
the
local
bank
and
are
paid.
whereas
the
american
express
money
orders
are
not
orders
on
a
bank
or
on
anyone.
they're
a
little
more
like
a
promise
that
the
american
express
company
will
pay
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
asked
mr.
smith
of
the
american
express
company,
if
you
ever
had
some
agents
that
went
bad
and
became
dishonest
and
he
said,
“yes,
they
did
occasionally.”
and
we
asked
him
if
in
all
cases
their
money
orders
were
paid
and
he
admitted
that
they
are
not,
that
sometimes
they
suspect
there
might
have
been
some
chicanery
they
won't
pay
their
money
orders
and
he
admitted
that
sometimes
their
opinion
is
not
in
accord
with
the
--
the
man's
opinion
who
put
up
the
money
and
bought
the
money
order
and
litigation
ensues.
and
in
that
connection,
the
record
shows
that
the
american
express
company
is
not
an
express
company
at
all.
it
is
not
licensed
in
illinois,
that's
admitted
in
the
pleadings.
it
is
a
joint
stock
company
under
the
old
dutch
laws
in
new
york.
it
has
only
five
in
illinois
under
the
illinois
assumed
name
statute,
a
certificate
that
25
individuals,
all
non-residence
of
illinois
are
doing
business
in
illinois
under
the
assumed
name
of
american
express
company.
and
we
asked
mr.
smith
about
those
various
individuals
and
we
found
out
that
five
of
them,
including
theodore
roosevelt
are
dead,
presumably
this
(inaudible)
was
filed
before
any
of
them
died
but
that
is
the
record
in
this
case,
that
it
is
not
a
certainty
that
when
a
person
in
illinois
buys
an
american
express
money
order,
it
is
not
absolutely
certain
at
all
events
that
he
--
that
that
will
be
paid.
the
court
also
had
reported
the
fact
that
there
are
three
cases
in
illinois
where
the
american
express
company
was
sued
and
they
defended
on
a
ground
other
than
the
merits
of
the
case
which
they
might
--
might
not
have
any
significance
because
there
are
only
three
of
them.
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
american
express
company,
the
court
should
know,
was
in
existence
before
counsel
says
it
was
1882
because
the
first
case
in
illinois
was
in
1865
when
they
were
actually
in
the
express
business
in
illinois.
somebody
made
a
shipment
of
money
by
way
of
american
express.
the
money
was
lost
and
a
suit
followed
and
the
american
express
filed
a
--
an
affidavit
that
the
service
wasn't
good
because
it
wasn't
a
corporation,
it
wasn't
a
legal
entity
and
couldn't
be
sued,
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
held
that
that
wasn't
a
good
plea
because
they
had
to
give
the
plaintiff
a
better
rip
which
has
no
significance,
no
claim
it
has
except
that
it
does
show
that
in
1865
there
really
were
an
express
company.
now,
there
were
some
mention
of
generic
terms
expressing
exception
whether
an
exception
perhaps
should
be
in
generic
terms
rather
than
singling
out
someone
by
name.
new
york
has
a
statute
that
contains
an
interesting
exemption
that
is
generic
in
its
nature
and
it
provides
--
it's
not
the
statute
referred
to
in
the
appellant's
brief
which
is
the
new
york
check-cashing
statute
that
has
no
exemption
in
it
and
nothing
to
do
with
this
case,
but
this
is
section
180
in
mckinney's
consolidated
laws
of
new
york,
book
4,
part
1,
banking
law,
section
131
and
section
180,
"prohibitions
against
encroachments
upon
certain
powers
of
private
bankers,
saving
banks
and
savings
and
loan
associations.
except
as
authorized
by
this
chapter,
no
individual,
either
for
himself
or
as
trustee
and
no
partnership
or
unincorporated
association
shall
engage
in
the
business
of
transmitting
money
or
selling
money
orders
unless
he
puts
up
at
each
place
from
which
his
money
orders
are
sold,
bonds,
the
federal,
state,
municipal
or
preschool
district
bonds
in
the
amount
of
$100,000
for
each
place
at
which
such
business
is
to
be
conducted."
nothing
in
this
paragraph
shall
apply
to
an
unincorporated
express
company
having
a
contract
with
a
railroad
company.
mr.
smith,
the
executive
vice-president
of
the
american
express
company,
testified
that
american
express
company
has
a
contract
--
a
contract
with
a
railroad
in
new
york.
he
said
he
thought
it
was
--
it
was
the
skaneateles
railroad
company.
the
skaneateles
railroad
runs
from
the
town
of
skaneateles
at
the
north
end
of
lake
skaneateles
and
onondaga
county
to
skaneateles
junction,
a
distance
of
five
miles.
because
the
american
express
company
has
that
contract,
a
contract
with
a
railroad,
it
does
not
have
to
put
up
$100,000
bonds
in
each
one
of
the
--
that
2500
places
in
new
york,
$250
million
in
order
to
sell
money
orders
averaging
$15
a
piece.
now,
we're
not
attacking
the
new
york
statute
but
it
was
in
generic
terms
and
i
give
it
for
the
purpose
of
this
illustration.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
had
this
identical
exemption
before
it
and
held
that
it
violated
the
--
the
equal
protections
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
well
as
the
missouri
constitution
of
this
very
statute.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
that's
right.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
well
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
but,
your
honor
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
no,
but,
your
honor
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
no,
i
don't.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
yes.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
but
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
--
that
illustrates
a
point
i
want
to
make,
if
the
court
please,
if
the
definition
is
something
--
if
it
applies
to
cities
of
500,000
and
over,
we
have
it
in
illinois,
if
it
applies
to
cities
of
500,000
and
over,
it's
good
although
at
the
time
there's
only
one
city
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
--
but
if
it
says
all
cities
now
having
a
population
of
500,000
and
over,
it's
bad.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
but
that's
a
special
legislation.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
oh,
no,
i
certainly
wouldn't.
no
and
i'm
not.
now,
i'm
giving
this
new
york
statute
as
an
illustration
because
the
fact
is
appellee's
licensors
in
this
case
has
an
express
company
called
the
travelers
express
company
and
it
has
a
contract
with
a
railroad
in
new
york
state
which
runs
all
the
way
out
of
the
state,
a
distance
of
11
miles
and
today
there
is
free
competition
in
new
york
between
the
american
express
company
money
orders
on
the
one
hand,
bondified
express
company
money
orders
on
the
other
hand.
there
is
today
free
competition
between
the
bondified
systems
and
mr.
smith
of
the
american
express
company
mentioned
this
in
his
testimony
in
missouri
and
in
new
york
and
in
ohio
and
in
massachusetts
and
in
california
and
in
texas
and
in
new
jersey
but
not
in
illinois.
now,
some
of
the
members
of
the
court
asked
the
question
as
to
a
limitation
of
$5
million.
well,
if
the
limitation
had
a
reasonable
relationship
to
the
objective
of
the
act,
of
course
it's
good.
if
it
doesn't
have,
of
course
it's
bad.
now,
it's
one
that
i
think
is
bad
but
this
is
a
matter
of
illustration,
florida
passed
an
act
that
nobody
can
sell
a
money
order
in
the
state
of
florida
unless
he
has
assets
or
it
has
assets
that
exceed
his
liabilities
by
$1
million
and
unless
for
a
period
of
five
years
before
they
passed
the
law
it
sold
travelers
checks
and
money
orders
in
florida.
now,
that
i
would
say
doesn't
necessarily
have
a
reasonable
relationship
to
the
purpose
of
the
act,
although
it
can
be
argued
that
it
would
have.
but
that
is
not
the
thing
we're
dealing
with
here.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
by
agreement.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
it
has.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
yes,
sir.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
i
--
i
tried
to
get
that,
your
honor,
from
mr.
smith
of
the
american
express
company
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
oh,
well,
ours?
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
oh,
i
couldn't
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
i
--
i
couldn't
say,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
well,
i
can
say
this
that
american
express
company,
the
record
shows
has
i
think
its
13,000
in
some
outlets.
some
of
them
make
maybe
an
average
of
--
they
sell
one
a
month
and
they
make
maybe
$3.50
for
a
year
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
about
the
gross
figures
we
do
not
have,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
well
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
all
the
people
around
in
the
--
in
the
area
where
they're
selling
this
money
orders,
they
want
to
--
they
want
to
pay
their
installment,
they
want
to
pay
their
light
bill,
they
use
to
pay
their
taxes
more
than
they
do
now
with
the
withholding
prohibitions.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
oh,
in
the
--
in
the
aggregate
it's
not.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
in
the
aggregate,
it's
not
petty
business.
i
wouldn't
say.
of
course
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
oh,
i
don't
think
it's
any
tremendous
amounts.
i
tried
this,
if
the
court
please,
i
tried
to
--
to
find
for
mr.
smith.
we
run
the
offices
of
the
american
express
company
and
i
--
i
got
from
them
--
they
put
in
their
financial
statements
showing
the
sources
of
their
income.
they
had
income
from
their
travel
operations.
and
they
had
the
amount
of
that
and
they
had
income
from
their
foreign
exchange
business
and
their
international
freight
forwarding
business
and
the
various
different
ramifications
that
they
have
all
over
the
world
and
their
--
their
collection
--
utilities
collection
business
they
also
have
and
they
had
some
of
those
but
they
couldn't
tell
me.
they
don't
segregate
their
money
order
business.
it
all
goes
into
the
pot
and
they
don't
--
they
don't
have
a
--
apparently
accurate
books
on
it
so
i
couldn't
determine
how
sizeable
it
was
in
the
state
of
illinois.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
no,
they
do
not,
your
honor.
i
tried
to
get
that
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
no,
your
honor.
i
will
say
this;
judge
schnackenberg
who
was
the
circuit
judge
who
presided
in
this
case
below
was
--
happened
to
have
been
the
speaker
of
the
house
of
--
in
the
house
of
the
illinois
legislature
when
this
statute
was
passed.
judge
schnackenberg
said
this
at
page
116
of
the
record,
judge
schnackenberg.
"let
me
ask
this,
with
the
exemption
of
this
law
we
are
considering,
do
you
know
of
any
illinois
statute
which
--
which
exempts
any
corporation
or
individual
by
name?"
mr.
soble
-
“well,
as
i
say
that
blue
sky
law
does.”
judge
schnackenberg
-
“that
doesn't
exempt
the
individual
by
name,
it
exempts
certain
securities
of
their
net
worth
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange
and
certain
exchanges
but
here
the
legislature
writes
into
the
law
itself
three
organizations
that
are
exempt
from
the
operation
of
the
law
and
i
ask
you,
has
there
ever
been
a
statute
passed
within
a
law
like
that
before?”
mr.
soble
-
“well,
i
cannot
say
that
i
know
the
answer
to
that
question
one
way
or
the
other,
i
don't
know.”
judge
schnackenberg,
and
this
gets
down
to
your
honor's
question,
"now,
in
the
legislature
it
has
been
almost
a
religion
with
us
that
if
anybody
was
to
be
exempted
or
any
laws
to
be
applied
to
a
group,
it
would
be
described
in
abstract
terms
as
a
class
having
certain
characteristics.
i
have
often
wondered
where
this
bill
came
from
named
a,
b
and
c,
those
sacred
cows
who
were
beyond
the
pail
of
the
law."
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
i
have
nothing
about
that,
your
honor,
except
hearsay
and
i
would
certainly
hesitate
to
state
that
in
this
court.
but
i
will
say
that
judge
tehan,
who
was
one
of
the
judges
in
the
wisconsin
three-judge
court,
he
was
a
wisconsin
state
senator
when
that
law
was
passed
and
i
have
the
record
here,
he
said,
“well,
i
didn't
know
about
this
law.
i
was
in
the
senate
then
and
i
didn't
know
that
they
had
put
this
through
that
wasn't
--
he
said,
“it
wasn't
ever
argued
on
the
floor
of
the
house
and
it
was
never
on
any
committee
that
i
knew
about."
and
judge
lindley
said,
"well,
judge,
that
wont
disqualify
it."
and
that's
all
there
was
in
that
record
about
that.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
but
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
that's
right.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
but
you
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
but
you
did
say,
your
honor,
in
that
case,
there
is
a
reasonable
relationship
in
this
respect
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
--
that
if
a
man
--
if
a
man
is
operating
a
bar
and
his
own
wife
and
own
daughters
and
now
you
can
count
on
him
to
protect
them
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
--
whereas
he
might
not
if
it
was
somebody
else's
wife
and
daughter.
well,
that
may
not
be
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
that
may
not
be
very
chivalrous
but
at
least
there
was
some
attempt
to
have
an
explanation.
now,
the
judges
--
the
three
judges
in
wisconsin
and
the
three
judges
in
illinois,
they
were
very
aware
of
the
need
to
defer
to
the
legislative
judgment,
i
think
they
have
as
much
deference
for
it
as
this
court,
but
they
had
this
record
and
they
have
this
statute
and
they
could
not
find
that
any
reasonable
relationship
of
this
so-called
classification,
which
actually
isn't
much
of
a
classification,
to
the
objectives
and
the
stated
purposes
of
the
act
which
was
not
only
to
--
to
protect
the
public
but
the
stated
purpose,
one
of
them
was
to
foster
currency
exchanges.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
there
was
a
very
good
reason,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
believe
it
is
three-and-half
--
less
than
three-and-half
months
after
the
act
passed,
the
postal
telegraph
company
went
out
of
existence.
i
think
it
was
swallowed
up
by
the
western
union.
the
western
union
telegraph
company,
in
order
to
operate
in
illinois,
first
of
all
has
to
get
a
license
as
a
corporation
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
that's
right.
it
has
to
subject
itself
to
the
public
utility
commission
of
the
state
and
come
under
the
public
utility
law
as
a
public
utility
as
does
an
express
company
operating
in
the
state
of
illinois.
not
only
that
but
the
utility
statute
provides
that
if
a
corporation
is
operating
as
a
public
utility,
it
must
submit
for
an
inspection
and
regulation
to
the
commission
any
other
business
it
may
carry
on.
so
that
if
the
western
union
company
is
sending
money
orders,
of
course
strictly
speaking
it
does,
it
wires
it's
agent
to
pay
somebody
some
money
and
he
doesn't
pass
money
orders
over-the-counter,
but
at
any
rate
it
is
subject
to
the
laws
of
the
state
of
illinois.
it
is
under
the
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
no.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
as
to
whether
they
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
--
carry
out
the
law,
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
assume
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
no,
and
there
exempts
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
those
--
whatever
the
western
union
sells
in
the
way
of
money
orders
are
not
subject
to
the
statute.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
well,
the
act
might
be
very
reasonable
and
permitting
them
to
--
not
to
have
to
conform
to
the
regulations
prescribed
by
the
act
if
the
state
in
some
other
--
the
--
another
commission
has
jurisdiction
over
them.
in
other
words,
if
they
are
submitting
to
--
to
regulation
under
another
statute,
i
can
conceive
that
it
would
be
a
--
a
reasonable
thing
for
the
legislature
to
say
well,
we
don't
have
to
make
them
do
it
twice
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
they
were
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
--
subject
to
the
banking
law.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
that's
correct.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
yes,
but
the
utility
commission
regulates
these
under
the
law,
is
suppose
to
regulate
this
because
it
regulates
any
other
business
that
it
covers.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
yes,
sir.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
no,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
no,
they
don't
sell
money
orders
in
the
sense
that
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
they
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
perhaps
they
just
said
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
that's
right
and
you'd
have
to
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
they're
not
as
far
as
i
know
and
of
course
the
state
couldn't
very
well
regulate
the
sale
of
united
state
money
orders.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
i
--
i
--
that's
my
understanding.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
i
suppose
not
if
it
wasn't
ultra
vires.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
that
is
as
far
as
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
--
the
statute
is
concerned.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
i
think
that's
very
correct.
one
other
thing,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
meant
to
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
well,
if
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
--
if
they
did
and
they
were
subject
to
regulation,
maybe
that
is
a
basic
and
--
and
a
proper
and
a
reasonable
exemption.
but
here,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
says
that
the
--
the
government
deposits
its
money
with
them,
i
don't
think
this
record
shows
that
or
maybe
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
maybe
you
take
judicial
notice
of
that
--
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
not
in
connection
with
their
money
order
business.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
no.
that's
right.
well,
i
wanted
to
answer
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
think
i
should
tell
you
that
in
the
wisconsin
trial,
judge
tehan
who
had
been
in
the
senate,
he
wanted
to
know,
“well,
who's
back
at
this,”
he
said,
“is
it
the
american
express
company?
is
it
somebody
who
just
reamed
this
up
or
is
--
what
is
the
reason
for
it?"
well,
nobody
could
tell
and
i'm
not
in
the
position
to
tell
the
court
here.
thank
you
very
much.
but
may
i
ask
--
just
pardon
--
just
one
minute.
mr.
g.
kent
yowell
there
--
the
question
of
irreparable
injury
has
been
raised
but
not
argued,
i
don't
want
to
weigh
it,
maybe
mr.
wines
didn't
have
time
to
cover
it
but
i
want
to
say
this.
that
finding
of
fact
number
10,
i
think,
disposes
of
that
contention
and
we
arrest
them.
thank
you.
