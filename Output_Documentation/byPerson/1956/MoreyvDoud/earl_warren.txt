49
of
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
of
course.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
question
as
to
the
solvency
or
the
good
business
practices
or
anything
else
of
the
american
express?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
--
that
isn't
in
the
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
question
was
asked
and
i
am
not
quite
sure
yet
but
the
answer
is
--
or
whether
the
federal
government
regulates
the
american
express
in
these
transactions.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
that's
all.

258,
there's
one.
it

bondified

order.
chief
justice
earl
warren
258,
i
see
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
wines,
does
this
have
anything
to
do
with
the
determination
of
the
constitutional
question
we
have
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
go
ahead.
no,
go
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
the
--
is
the
way
these
plaintiffs
happen
to
be
transacting
their
business
at
the
present
time
as
compared
with
the
american
express
the
important
thing
or
is
the
statutory
requirement
of
their
--
of
their
license
the
important
thing
in
determining
the
constitutional
question?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
what
do
you
mean
by
complete
replica?
do
you
mean
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
having
the
same
financial
background?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
same
historical
background?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
same
--
the
same
--
that
security
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
all
of
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
you
don't
mean
just
the
method
of
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
doing
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
wines,
in
order
to
bring
it
to
realities
as
you
have
spoken
of,
would
it
be
--
would
it
be
essential
in
order
to
equate
the
business
of
these
two
companies
that
they
both
be
of
the
same
size,
that
they
both
be
of
the
same
age,
that
they
both
operate
in
foreign
countries,
that
they
both
have
the
same
amount
of
capital
or
might
there
not
be
other
factors
that
would
--
that
would
enter,
namely,
the
amount
of
business
they
are
doing
and
where
they
do
it
--
do
it
in
order
to
equate
the
business
from
a
standpoint
of
safety?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
wines,
may
i
ask
you
this
question
and
i
suppose
this
rule
of
yours
would
apply
to
--
to
any
business
serving
to
regulation
by
the
state
or
the
police
power?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
take
--
let's
take
a
business
like
the
liquor
business.
is
that
subject
to
regulation
as
--
as
this
business
is?
now,
suppose
the
legislature
said,
we
must
regulate
the
liquor
traffic
but
we
have
absolute
confidence
in
x
liquor
company,
an
old
established
company
that's
thoroughly
sound
financially
and
treats
its
customers
all
right
and
we
will
require
all
of
the
liquor
concerns
in
the
state
to
be
regulated
except
this
one
company.
suppose
you
have
the
same
thing
with
a
--
with
a
pawnbroker
or
any
of
the
other
kinds
of
businesses
that
have
to
be
licensed,
could
you
do
the
same
thing
there
that
you
can
do
in
this
business?
chief
justice
earl
warren
take
a
pawnbroker's
business
then.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
no
more
time.
mr.
yowell.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
consider
the
question
of
clean
hands
important
in
--
in
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
decision
of
this
matter?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
wonder
then
that
the
constitutional
question
isn't
a
thing
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
we're
interested
then.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
hasn't
been
argued
seriously
here
but
clean
hands
is
just
the
difference
between
financial
responsibility
as
they
stated
of
--
of
the
american
express
and
the
--
the
appellees
here.
but
if
you
want
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
if.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there's
no
regulation
--
there
would
be
no
regulation
at
all
as
to
how
many
--
how
many
outlets
the
american
express
could
have.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
it
could
swamp.
it
could
swamp
anybody
who
is
undertaking
to
come
in
to
the
community
by
putting
so
many
outlets
in
that
there
wouldn't
be
any
--
any
necessity
for
any
others,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
might
--
nor
to
get
rid
of
all
competition
and
then
have
it
to
itself
and
do
as
it
please.
that
--
that
is
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
monopolistic
practices
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
it
seems
to
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
suppose
you
would
say
though
that
if
they
picked
out
one
liquor
dealer
from
among
these
private
enterprisers
and
said,
"well,
we
like
you
and
we
have
confidence
in
you
and
you
don't
have
to
be
regulated
but
everyone
--
everyone
else
does."
suppose
you'd
say
that
--
that,
would
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
yowell.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
no,
we'll
just
recess.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
yowell,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
been
construed
by
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
has
that
been
construed
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida?
chief
justice
earl
warren
your
--
the
reason
you
gave
is
the
reason
i
presume
that
they
didn't
include
banks,
isn't
that
right?
because
they
were
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
were
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
(voice
overlap)
under
the
banking
laws
of
the
state.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
i
suppose
if
they
did,
you
would
consider
them
in
the
same
category
as
--
as
the
american
express,
wouldn't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
far
as
this
act
is
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
it
doesn't
take
--
take
long,
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
