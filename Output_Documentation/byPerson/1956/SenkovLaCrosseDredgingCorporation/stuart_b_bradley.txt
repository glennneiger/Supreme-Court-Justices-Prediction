mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
comes
from
the
country
of
mark
twain
whose
life
on
the
mississippi,
you
all
know,
wherein
it
is
described
the
arduous
training,
the
esprit
de
corps
and
the
small
select
company
of
personnel
that
make
up
the
member
of
a
crew
of
a
vessel
and
that
is
true,
the
principle
of
what
is
a
member
of
a
crew
applies
on
the
mississippi
river,
the
same
as
it
would
on
any
vessel
applying
in
the
atlantic
ocean
or
anywhere
else.
there
is
a
group,
a
company
of
men
under
the
command
of
a
master
that
worked
together
that
have
this
as
esprit
de
corps
and
who
are
subject
to
the
orders
of
--
at
anytime
of
day
or
night
in
order
to
operate
and
navigate
the
vessel.
the
principles
as
to
whether
or
not
the
jones
act
is
applicable
to
a
workman
are
decided
by
the
cases
and
contained
three
essential
elements.
those
are
that
the
vessel
be
in
navigation,
that
the
worker,
his
duties
will
be
are
--
to
be
primarily
in
the
aid
of
navigation
and
that
the
man
must
have
a
permanent
connection
with
the
vessel.
those
principles
are
recited
in
the
south
chicago
coal
&
dock
company
versus
bassett
and
in
all
of
the
other
cases.
i
do
not
believe
there's
any
dispute
as
a
matter
of
law
that
those
are
the
principles
which
apply
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
man
is
a
seaman
and
member
of
the
crew
of
a
vessel.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
under
the
definition
of
vessel
contained
in
federal
statutes,
a
dredge
is
a
vessel
but
it
was
not
in
navigation.
and
in
this
case,
the
--
not
only
was
this
man
not
a
seaman,
a
member
of
the
crew,
but
it
was
not
on
navigable
waters.
that
is
our
position
and
that
was
the
decision
of
the
appellate
court
in
reversing
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
and
finding
as
a
matter
and
ultimate
conclusion
which
was
correct
as
we
say
that
those
were
matters
of
law
or
ultimate
conclusions
to
be
determined
by
the
--
by
the
court
rather
than
by
being
conclusive
as
a
matter
decided
by
the
jury.
now,
with
those
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
i
--
there
is
no
authority
that
says
that
the
situations
such
as
we
have
here
is
in
navigation,
no,
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
the
gianfala
case
is
distinguishable
from
this
case
on
several
grounds.
in
the
first
place,
in
our
case
now
before
your
honors,
the
injury
occurred
on
land
when
this
man
was
entering
a
building.
the
waters
involved
here
are
not
navigable
as
i
will
point
out
when
i
get
to
the
facts.
in
the
gianfala
case,
the
accident
occurred
on
the
gulf
of
mexico
where
the
men
worked
so
many
days
on,
so
many
days
off,
subject
to
call
12
hours
a
day.
they
were
kept
in
a
camp
or
site,
more
or
less
equivalent
to
the
operation
of
crews
of
vessels
as
distinguished
from
the
facts
of
our
case
which
i
will
turn
to
in
a
minute.
i
think
those
are
all
--
some
of
the
distinguishing
features
of
the
gianfala
case
in
which
all
of
the
five
cases
cited
also
were
accidents
on
navigable
waters
whereas
we
have
here
before
your
honors
an
accident
on
land.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
is
that
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
that
is
not
the
whole
answer.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
if
this
man
--
if
this
man
were
a
seaman
and
his
duties
pertained
to
navigation,
then
if
he
happened
to
be
injured
on
land,
he
would
be
entitled
to
recover
under
the
doctrine
of
great
lakes
dredge
&
dock
company-o'donnell
case,
where
--
but
in
that
case
where
the
man
was
injured
on,
the
court
pointed
out
carefully
that
if
he
was
entitled
to
recover
because
he
was
a
seaman
and
his
duties
pertained
to
navigation
and
he
was
temporarily
on
the
shore
handling
a
line,
aiding
the
ship
in
docking
or
something
of
that
type
when
he
was
injured,
that's
the
distinction.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
the
control
--
that
is
one.
the
most
important
issue
here
is
whether
this
man
was
a
seaman
member
of
the
crew.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
that
--
that
is
quite
wrong.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
may
i
--
would
i
--
i
would
like
to
have
you
enlarged
on
that.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
the
waters
with
which
we
are
concerned
are
a
slough.
one
of
the
little
backwaters
along
the
mississippi
river
which
at
high
water,
flood
stage
boats,
small
crafts
such
as
rowboats
can
go
through.
at
certain
times
as
shown
in
the
record
in
this
case
and
there's
no
dispute
whatever
about
the
facts
of
the
condition
of
this
particular
area,
at
certain
times
of
the
year
wagons
can
drive
across,
there
is
a
dike
that
has
crossed
it
and
has
been
in
there
for
many
years
since
one
of
the
older
man
who
testified
in
the
case
said
in
his
recollection
was
somewhere
around
1892.
it
is
true
that
at
certain
points
in
this
slough,
water
was
at
certain
stages,
20
feet
deep.but
at
other
times,
according
to
several
witness,
it
would
be
so
low
that
you
could
not
go
through
with
a
rowboat.
now,
the
--
this
particular
slough
was
near
a
point
known
as
chain
of
rocks
on
the
mississippi
river
where
there
were
certain
obstructions
to
navigation
of
the
channel
of
the
mississippi
river
itself.
so
that
the
u.s.
engineers
undertook
to
build
a
new
channel
and
to
build
a
lot
utilizing
in
part
the
course
of
this
slough
and
the
dredge
and
the
first
work
that
was
done
was
to
go
in
and
build
this
--
build
this
lock.
and
when
this
lock
was
built
in
a
different
--
certain
times
when
the
water
was
high,
there
were
barges
that
were
able
to
go
in
there,
shallow
draft
barges
to
bring
equipment
for
the
use
in
building
that
lock
on
several
occasions.
but
the
testimony
in
the
record
is
that
at
certain
--
there
are
many
times
in
the
year
you
couldn't
get
in
at
all
and
that
was
true
even
in
november
5,
1951
at
the
time
of
this
accident.
so,
that
we
--
it
is
our
contention
that
this
work
which
was
being
done
by
the
dredge
permanently,
solidly
affixed
to
the
shore
by
spuds
and
also
by
cables
attached
to
anchors
and
when
say
i
say
anchors,
your
honors,
i
do
not
mean
anchors
such
as
a
vessel
would
use
but
something
that's
put
up
on
the
shore
attached
to
a
cable
to
hold
this
earth-moving
equipment.
furthermore,
the
vessel
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
they
could
shifted
around
by
the
use
of
pulling
on
the
cables
or
like
--
or
by
the
movement
of
the
spuds.
these
four
spuds
that
were
driven
solidly
down
into
the
--
to
the
ground,
then
they
use
a
cutter
head
to
cut
away
the
dirt
and
send
them
--
pump
it
through
a
pipeline
which
ran
from
this
dredge
up
over
on
to
the
bank.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
we
do
not
call
that
navigation,
no,
sir.
that
is
a
permanent
structure
fastened
there,
shifted
around
on
these
spuds
and
it
has
a
pipeline
going
to
the
shore
and
that
is
solidly
affixed
and
it's
quite
an
operation
to
move
that.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
not
within
the
principle
of
the
new
river
case.
not
for
the
purpose
of
saying
that
the
federal
power
commission
for
instance
would
have
control
to
prevent
its
being
obstructed
as
it
might
be
needed
in
the
future
for
navigation
purposes.
but
here,
we
have
something
different.
we
have
the
question
of
whether
this
man's
duties
pertain
to
navigation,
whether
he
is
a
seaman
member
of
the
crew
on
navigable
waters
and
while
it
might
be
that
a
--
a
stream
or
a
slough
if
it
were
the
only
channel
going
through
a
certain
area
and
at
certain
times
of
the
year
you
could
go
through
it
with
rowboats,
might
be
preserved
for
navigation
purposes.
we
contend
that
that
would
not
apply
to
this
slough
where
you
have
the
mississippi
river
right
along
side
navigable
and
our
issue
is
whether
this
man's
duties
pertain
to
navigation,
not
whether
the
federal
government
has
authority
under
the
commerce
clause
to
preserve
this
water
way,
such
as
was
done
in
the
appalachian
power
case,
i
believe.
now,
the
--
some
of
the
facts
i
think
need
to
be
enlarged
on
a
little
more.
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
lived
at
mt.
olive,
illinois
which
were
some
40
miles
from
the
worksite.
he
travelled
to
and
from
his
place
of
work
by
automobile.
he
went
home
at
night.
he
was
paid
a
daily
wage
and
overtime
for
any
extra
work
in
excess
of
eight
hours
in
the
day
or
more
than
40
hours
in
a
week.
he
was
sent
to
this
employer,
the
respondent,
by
the
laborers'
union
which
supplied
men
not
only
for
the
dredge
but
for
all
the
rest
of
the
work
that
was
being
done
by
this
contractor.
and
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
the
dredging
part
was
only
one
phase
of
shaping
the
bank,
use
of
tractors,
hand
tools
and
other
things
going
on
the
bank.
the
laborers'
union
supplied
these
men,
some
either
nine
men
to
this
particular
job
the
union
representative
on
the
job,
who
was
called
a
pusher,
assigned
one
man
to
go
and
work,
one
laborer
to
go
and
work
on
the
dredge,
other
men
to
do
work
in
other
places
in
the
entire
operation.
so
that
you
must
regard
this
as
being
a
large
earth
moving
job
where
the
duties
were
partly
on
land
and
partly
on
this
dredge
which
was
--
had
dug
its
way
in
and
actually
did
have
to
dig
its
way
in
and
plow
its
way
in
to
get
to
the
place
where
it
was
working.
now
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
--
that's
why
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
no,
your
honor.
we
are
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
our
position
is
that
this
man
could
not
possibly
be
considered
a
member
of
a
crew.one
of
the
man
--
laborers
that
worked
one
of
three
shifts
who
go
home,
who
have
a
few
incidental
duties
related
to
water,
but
so
purely
incidental
that
it
doesn't
make
him
into
a
man
who
aids
in
the
navigation
of
a
vessel.
he
had
no
skills
whatever
relating
to
navigation,
had
no
training
of
any
kind
in
that
regard
and
the
evidence
is
undisputed
in
this
record
as
to
what
the
duties
of
seaman
in
the
mississippi
area
are
and
there
is
quite
a
distinction
and
i
would
like
to
point
those
out.
for
example,
the
navigation
on
the
mississippi
river
consists
of
use
of
towboats
and
barges
for
the
most
part.
the
duties,
as
shown
in
the
record,
undisputed
in
this
record
of
seaman
as
distinguished
from
the
petitioner
here
include
these
things
that
he
--
he
must
have
knowledge
of
navigation
lights
and
of
navigation
routes,
how
to
handle
ratchets,
cables
for
the
purpose
of
making
up
and
breaking
up
the
towboats
of
barges.
he
must
know
how
to
recognize
buoys
and
lights
and
a
great
many
other
things.
he
also
--
the
man
that
worked
on
the
towboats
and
on
the
vessels
on
these
rivers
belong
to
one
or
another
of
the
maritime
unions,
for
instance
the
officers
to
the
master
made
some
(inaudible)
and
the
--
the
personnel
or
deckhands,
the
seaman
belong
to
one
of
the
other
unions,
principally
in
the
national
maritime
union.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
definitely
not.
under
the
evidence
in
this
case,
this
man
cannot
possibly
qualify.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
no,
they
would
not
either.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
i've
--
that
is
correct.
i
didn't
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
that
is
--
that
is
our
position
and
that
is
borne
out
by
the
state
--
by
these
cases
which
is
that
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
only
in
the
fact
that
there
happens
to
be
a
statute
of
certain
purposes,
at
least
says
that
any
description
of
water
perhaps
can
be
a
vessel.
now,
there
are
definitions
under
the
shipping
acts,
under
the
connection
of
the
maritime
administration
which
say
that
--
to
give
other
definitions
and
one
of
them
is
that
it
must
be
engaged
in
--
in
an
actual
navigation.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
no,
you
did
not,
your
honor,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
--
brennan,
i
said
that
within
the
definition
in
--
but
it
takes
more
than
that
in
order
for
a
man
to
come
within
the
jones
act
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
not
on
this
kind
of
a
dredge
in
this
kind
of
work
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
--
but
there
are
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
i
think
so
because
after
all
what
--
in
determining
whether
a
man
is
a
seaman,
it's
the
nature
of
his
work
that
counts.
that
is
that
he
actually
be
in
navigation
and
although
this
dredge
is
within
that
federal
or
statutory
definition,
a
vessel,
it
does
not
navigate
and
that
is
the
distinction.
now,
there
are
dredges
which
do
navigate,
there
are
dredges
that
can
cross
the
north
atlantic
and
just
like
merchant
vessels
and
are
--
they
have
this
compliment
of
officers
and
crew
just
as
i
described.
i've
--
we've
--
i've
seen
them,
they
have
been
sent
to
dredge
out
channels
in
--
in
the
--
in
connection
to
the
war,
but
those
are
--
that's
entirely
different.
now,
their
--
the
dredge
describe
in
--
in
one
of
the
first
circuit
cases
cited
by
the
petitioner
here
is
such
a
dredge
it
may
--
it
made
a
trip
from
new
york
to
boston
with
regular
crew.
so
that
--
it
is
possible
to
have
a
dredge
that
will
have
personnel
that
can
qualify
a
seaman
but
our
position
is
that
this
man,
in
this
kind
of
an
operation,
could
not
be,
as
a
matter
of
law,
a
seaman
subject
to
the
jones
act.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
the
line
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
the
dredge
itself,
they
are
built
with
a
--
with
a
haul
that's
suitable
for
--
for
navigating
in
storms
or
withstanding
open
sea
work
or
--
but
of
course
the
principal
distinction
is
the
fact
that
if
you
have
a
ship's
company,
a
crew
of
men
that
work
steadily
for
a
time
and
then
may
be
off,
you
do
have
the
elements
of
seamanship
and
navigation
when
this
vessel
is
moving
from
one
place
to
another.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
i
believe
so
and
particularly
if
the
man
were,
as
mr.
senko
in
this
case,
a
laborer
who
lived
at
home,
came
to
work,
worked
eight
hour
shifts
and
who
were
not
--
we're
not
trained
in
navigating,
it
must
have
something
to
do
with
the
actual
operation
and
navigation
of
the
ship.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
i
would
say
that
that
type
of
bridging
operation
is
so
different
than
the
normal
and
legal
concepts
of
navigation
that
they
would
not
qualify
on
that
basis.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
either
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
yes,
your
honor.
either
as
a
question
of
navigating
or
as
a
question
of
the
duties
which
the
man
himself
performs
which
is
what
the
courts
must
look
to.
now,
we
believe
that
it's
very
important
for
the
question
of
interpretation
of
a
statute
such
as
the
jones
act
to
rest
in
the
hands
of
the
justices
and
judges
of
the
court
that
are
learned
in
the
law
and
that
the
application
of
this
law
should
not
be
left
as
purely
a
question
which
can
be
decided
by
a
jury
because
those
questions
of
the
extent
of
that
law
should
be
decided
by
the
--
by
the
court.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
go
on.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
whether
the
facts
are
as
this
creates
undisputed,
taking
all
the
facts
most
favorable
to
the
petitioner.
all
of
these
activities
and
examining
them
with
care.
this
man
could
not
possibly
be
a
seaman.
it
comes
then
to
an
interpretation
and
application
of
this
act.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
that's
right
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
--
but
the
court
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
it
should
have
directed
a
verdict.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
i
do
say
that
the
question
of
status
is
for
the
court
where
the
--
except
this
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
--
if
there
were
--
yes,
i
do.if
there
were
a
dispute
as
to
whether
or
not
this
man
--
whether
everyone
aboard
the
boat
or
not,
some
question
of
fact
as
to
what
he
did.
i
think
that
of
course
would
be
left
to
the
jury.
just
as
in
the
line
of
f.
e.
l.
a.
cases
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
the
question
of
the
ultimate
decision
of
the
application
of
the
law
rests
with
this
court
just
as
has
been
decided
very
recently
in
the
--
the
case
of
the
gileo
case
and
reed
versus
pennsylvania
railroad
company,
where
those
question
of
the
application
of
the
amended
f.
e.
l.
a.
is
decided
by
this
court.
i
think
those
same
principles
apply
to
--
to
the
jones
act,
the
application
of
the
jones
act,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
because
despite
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
you
did,
your
honor.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
not
at
all.
it
is
not
part
of
the
jones
act
by
the
way.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
and
i
think
it's
quite
immaterial
to
the
conclusion
that
this
man
is
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
in
--
in
the
very
first
volume,
it's
one
united
states
code
annotated
section
3.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
the
term
vessel
shall
be
understood
to
comprehend
every
description
of
vessel
navigating
on
any
sea
or
channel,
lake
or
river.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
i
say
that
whether
--
whether
it
applies,
i
don't
believe
it
applies
myself.
but
whether
it
applies
or
not,
this
vessel,
though
it
be
defined
as
a
vessel
and
we
have
to
admit
the
dredge
is
a
vessel
under
that
definition,
it
is
not
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
--
navigating.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
purely
because
the
statute
said
so.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
the
best
explanation
which
i
can
give
of
that
is
that
the
cases
dealing
with
the
jones
act
say
that
it
is
not
necessary
--
it
is
not
conclusive
that
a
man
be
aboard
a
vessel
but
that
the
vessel
must
be
in
navigation
and
that
the
man's
duties
must
pertain
to
the
navigation
and
management
of
the
vessel.
that
is
the
distinction.
now
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
you're
quite
right.
but
this
dredge
does
not
navigate.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
well,
that
may
be
but
there
is
that
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
no,
it
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
this
is
not
navigating,
this
vessel
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
that
may
be
so.
i
did
have
to
cite
the
statute
though
as
it
was
read
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
--
and
i
was
asked
that
whether
there
was
anything
in
the
federal
law
which
defined
vessel.
but
that
is
not
part
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
any
description
of
water
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
yes.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
that's
correct.
that
is
right.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
oh,
i
didn't
get
that,
your
honor.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
because
the
decisions
dealing
with
the
jones
act
say
that
the
man
must
not
only
be
a
seaman
but
thus
must
be
a
member
of
a
crew
and
that
comes
about
from
the
history
which
grew
out
of
the
longshoreman
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act.
at
one
time,
the
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
and
--
oh,
no.
else,
also
a
member
of
the
crew,
both
are
required.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
both
are
required.
the
old
haverty
case
decided
that
longshoreman
were
seaman.
that
is
--
that
was
long
before
the
longshoreman
act
was
adopted
and
then
after
the
longshoreman
act
provided
workman's
compensation
for
the
class
of
workers
such
as
the
petitioner
here
who
work
partly
on
land
and
partly
on
shore
and
may
discharge
cargo
or
were
ships
carpenters
or
ships
keepers
and
so
on,
all
that
class
of
miscellaneous
workers
who
are
not
crew
members
were
provided
with
a
federal
compensation,
then
the
decisions
of
--
established
of
this
court
--
have
established
that
that
takes
out
of
the
classes
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
that's
right.
but
it
does
cut
out
formally
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
that's
right.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
that's
--
that's
correct.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
no,
also
--
this
cases
like
the
swanson
versus
marra
bros.say
that
the
effect
of
the
longshoreman
act
is
that
in
order
for
the
jones
act
to
apply,
the
man
must
be
both
a
member
of
a
seaman
and
a
member
of
the
crew
that
is
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
that
--
that
is
quite
so.
we
have
cited
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
oh,
yes,
he
would,
your
honor.
where
--
they
are
a
part
of
that
whole
ship's
company
and
are
subject
to
those
same
regulations
and
the
discipline
of
the
ship
and
they
are
part
of
a
crew
even
though
he
might
only
be
a
cook.
but
here,
in
our
case
before
this
court,
this
man
had
worked
--
for
instance
he'd
worked
as
a
minor,
he
worked
as
a
laborer
in
construction
industry
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
a
ship's
company.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
and
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
navigation
and
he
never
had
anything
to
do
with
navigation.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
a
waiter
on
a
merchant
ship,
on
a
vessel,
it's
in
navigation,
i
would
agree
should
be
subject
to
the
jones
act.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
yes.
oh,
yes,
your
honor,
because
he
is
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
well,
yes,
because
he
is
part
of
that
ship's
company
and
that
whole
operating
mechanism,
but
this
laboring
--
labor
operations
such
as
we
have
now
before
the
court,
that
is
quite
different
from
a
merchant
vessel.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
he
was
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
in
the
gianfala
case,
there
were
a
good
many
distinctions
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
--
he
was
hurt
on
land
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
i
believe
in
part,
yes.
there
are
some
others,
but
i
see
my
time
is
up.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
that
a
dredge
is
not?
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
no,
i
did
not
say
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
not
that
i
know
off,
no.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
yes.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
well,
there
are
--
there
are
many
cases
that
--
through
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
now,
you
have
to
look
to
see
whether
this
vessel,
it
is,
is
in
navigation
and
is
crewed
and
if
the
personnel
have
these
duties
that
relate
to
navigation,
there
--
therein
lies
the
test.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
i'll
just
take
a
few
more
moments
your
honor.
justice
frankfurter
asked
for
a
definition
of
a
--
a
vessel,
and
there's
another
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
well,
there's
title
1,
section
3
united
states
code
annotated
defines
vessels
--
defined
a
vessels
as
--
as
follows.
the
word
"vessel"
includes
every
description
of
watercraft
or
other
artificial
contrivance
used
or
capable
--
capable
of
being
used
as
a
means
of
transportation
on
water.
that's
another
definition.
i
don't
urge
upon
the
court,
but
the
court's
bound
with
that
definition
but
there
is
a
definition
in
that
particularly.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
that's
title
1
section
3
u.s.
code
annotated.
i
said
i
didn?t
urge
it
on
the
point
of
the
court.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
what
did
you
say,
sir?
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
well,
i'd
like
that.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
i
would
think
so.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
no,
your
honor.
the
gianfala
case
scited
several
cases
in
this
per
curiam
decision
and
the
--
a
couple
of
the
decisions,
the
wilkes
versus
mississippi
river
sand
and
gravel
company
and
gahagan
construction
company
versus
armao
cited
there
and
the
south
chicago
coal
and
dock
company
were
all
dredge
cases.
and
it's
interesting
to
note
that
in
the
south
chicago
coal
and
dock
company,
the
court
held
that
--
they
held
in
that
case
that
they
were
bound
by
the
findings
of
the
commissioner
that
the
man
was
not
a
crew
member.
but,
they
also
held
that
was
a
question
of
fact
defined
and
the
--
the
appellate
court
in
reversing
this
judgment
used
the
south
chicago
coal
and
dock
company
to
reverse
it.
now,
in
my
interpretation
to
the
south
chicago
coal
and
dock
company
is
--
case
--
is
that
that
case
says
that
you
leave
it
to
a
question
of
fact
whether
it
should
be
the
commission
or
whether
it
should
be
the
jury,
whichever,
what
way
you
happen
to
go
on
the
thing
and
they
used
that
particular
thing
to
say
that
the
dredge
--
where
it
was
situated
couldn't
--
since
it
was
anchored
and
so
on
and
so
forth,
it
could
keep
it
beyond
the
--
in
the
jones
act.
now,
in
distinguishing
this
case,
the
appellate
court,
from
the
case
of
mckie
versus
diamond
marine
company,
204
f.2d
132
and
wilkes
versus
mississippi
river
sand
and
gravel
company,
202
f.2d,
the
court
said
whether
these
cases
should
be
regarded
as
close
or
as
a
encroaching
on
any
like
--
enacted
legislation
is
immaterial.
they
do
not
apply
to
a
plaintiff,
employed
under
a
union,
permit
to
perform
common
labor
on
a
local
project
and
who's
duties
are
to
perform
while
the
applicant
is
securely
attached
to
the
garment.
the
net
result
of
this
reasoning
denies
the
benefits
of
the
jones
act
to
all
man
engaged
in
dredging
and
then
the
usual
course
of
dredging
on
our
ordinary
dredging
operations
on
our
in
bound
navigable
waters.
they
say
that
the
james
wilkinson
was
no
different
from
any
of
the
rest
of
this
dredging
that
would
--
dredging
in
and
out
of
here,
when
in
navigable
waters
when
the
court
held
that
they
were
vessels
and
that
whether
or
not
the
vessel
with
people
on
them
remember
the
crew
that
there
was
any
evidence
at
all
to
sustain
that
if
there
was
never
the
venture
basis
and
it
was
a
question
of
fact
to
the
jury
and
not
to
the
court.
now,
there
was
just
one
thing
i
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
the
issues
i
think
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
i
would
ask
the
jury
to
be
instructive
and
then
if
you
find
and
believe
from
the
evidence
that
on
the
particular
date
in
question,
the
plaintiff
was
a
member
of
the
crew
of
james
--
of
the
james
wilkinson
and
that
the
james
wilkinson
was
operating
our
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
and
that
he
was
injured
in
the
course
of
his
employment
through
the
negligence
of
the
defendant,
then
you
shall
find
that
the
issues
in
favor
to
plaintiff
and
against
the
defendant
can
assess
judges
judgment
in
the
sum
of
$30,000.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
doesn't
it
sir?
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
if
you
--
if
you
believe
from
the
evidence
in
the
--
in
the
incidentally
--
in
the
illinois,
the
--
that
he's
not
incumbent
upon
counsel,
nor
upon
a
trial
court
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
i
would
define
a
member
of
the
crew
as
anyone
who
edge
the
ship
or
the
vessel
in
doing
or
accomplishing
the
purpose
which
he
was
intended
to
accomplish.
now,
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
well,
we
reuse
the
paraphrase
"member
of
the
crew"
because
the
--
the
men
under
the
maritime
law,
as
i
read
that
the
--
there
used
to
be
a
recovery
including
all
people
who
were
not
members
of
the
crew
and
were
members
of
the
crew,
when
he
passed
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers
act,
that
act
specifically
excluded
from
its
coverage
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
no.
your
honor
i
may
have
assumed
the
greater
burden
then
i
have
to
but
at
least
to
the
question
of
the
--
there
was
a
question
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
yes,
but
a
seaman
can
be
a
cook.
a
seaman
can
be
--
a
seaman
is
anyone
who
does
anything
at
all
to
aid
the
ship
or
the
vessel.
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
and
is
doing
something
--
mr.
stuart
b.
bradley
in
other
words,
he's
not
restricted
to
personally
cast
off
the
lines.
in
other
words,
everybody
just
doing
anything,
aboard
the
ship
in
furtherance
of
its
project
is
a
seaman,
and
is
a
member
of
the
crew
if
he
has
that
fixed
and
permanent
connection
with
the
crew
and
which
of
course
first
would
be
a
question
of
fact
to
the
jury.
now,
there
was
one
statement
made.
i
just
want
to
clear
up
that
--
i
think
approximately
and
advertently
said
that
that
this
was
securely
imbedded
into
the
screen
with
this
two
spuds
and
these
two
anchors,
that
is
not
true.
the
spuds
work
like
two
huge
suction
cups.
when
they
want
to
move,
the
--
the
machine
release
one
spud
up
and
tighten
on
one
anchor.
when
i
want
to
move
the
other
way,
release
the
other
spud
up
and
tightens
on
the
other
anchor.
the
ship
or
the
dredge
--
the
dredge
ship
moves
itself
all
over
and
did
move
itself
all
over
these
200
or
300
feet
space
of
water
with
its
own
power.
and
as
we
say,
when
it
was
dredging,
it
was
navigating,
it
was
--
doing
the
purpose
through
which
it
was
designed
and
if
we
hold
that
senko
was
not
a
seaman
and
that
thus
other
people
under
were
not
a
seaman,
then
we
have
a
vessel
without
a
crew.
