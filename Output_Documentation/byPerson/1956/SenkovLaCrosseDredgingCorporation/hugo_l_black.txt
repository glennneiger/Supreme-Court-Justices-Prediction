justice
hugo
l.

well,
what
is
the
line
between
a
dredge
that
is
engaged
in
navigation
and
one
that
is
not?
what
line
do
you
draw?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
there
about
the
man
but
the
number
of
the
crew
or
anything
like
that.
i'm
talking
about
the
dredge.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
have
a
vessel
that
--
a
dredge
towards
--
between
alexander
and
virginia
and
district
of
columbia,
a
very
short
distant
and
very
slowly
stops
that
could
set
down,
works
and
then
moves
for
a
few
feet
and
does
that
day
by
day.
you're
contention
is
that
would
not
be
--
that
it
would
not
be
engaged
in
navigation
within
the
meaning
of
the
jones
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
there
--
suppose
there
are
some
who
are
trained
moving
that
vessel
that
it
actually
--
that
dredge
that
it
actually
moved
during
that
--
in
that
short
space
between
d.c.
and
alexandria,
virginia.
maybe
let's
say
a
man
works
there
all
the
time,
day
by
day,
week
by
week,
month
by
month,
just
moving
a
little
at
a
time
and
the
men
there
do
the
moving
either
with
--
by
one
force
or
another.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
what
i'm
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
trying
to
find
out,
what
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
refer
me
in
your
brief
to
the
case
as
you
have
cited
which
called
that
a
dredge
is
not
a
vessel?
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
dredge
is
not
a
vessel.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
have
you
--
has
any
case
ever
held
that
a
dredge
is
not
a
vessel?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
any
case
ever
held
that
a
dredge
merely
because
it
was
a
dredge
is
not
a
vessel
within
the
meaning
of
the
jones
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
case
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
now
about
the
other
things
you
mentioned.
i'm
talking
about
on
the
basis
that
it's
not
a
vessel.
i'm
asking
you
because
i
had
supposed
that
--
settle
without
any
diversity
of
opinion
at
all
that
a
dredge
is
a
vessel,
like
other
vessels
on
the
ocean,
on
the
water,
wherever
they
are
and
if
you
look
to
other
things
to
see
whether
or
not
a
man
working
on
it
is
covered
by
the
jones
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
add
--
do
you
--
do
you
have
emphasis
to
the
words
"ponder
over"
or
do
you
say
that
by
reading
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
should
think
you
can
read
it.
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
issue
you
think
should
be
submitted
to
the
jury?
what
would
be
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
your
definition
if
you
want
to
instruct
the
jury?
what
would
you
ask
them
to
find,
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
doesn't
quite
begin
at
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
--
how
would
you
then
explain
to
him,
how
ways
they
would
find
whether
he
was
a
member
of
the
crew?
what
would
you
charge
him
about
that?
if
you
believe
what
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
--
i
--
as
i
withdraw
the
charge
fund,
how
would
you
define
a
member
of
the
crew?
