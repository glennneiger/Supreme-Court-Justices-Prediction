mr.
moran.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
finding
because
he
wasn't
a
member
of
the
crew
or
because
it
was
in
navigable
waters
or
both?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
take
your
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
it
your
own
way.
chief

mr.
bradley.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
mr.
moran
to
say
that
it
had
been
held
that
a
--
that
a
dredge
in
these
circumstances
was
in
navigation.
i
understood
you
to
say
that
it
isn't,
is
there
authority
one
way
or
the
other?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
a
waterway
is
navigable
sometime
--
sometime
of
the
year
and
--
and
is
used
for
that
purpose
and
another
--
other
times
of
the
year,
it
is
absolutely
not
navigable,
as
a
matter
of
law
does
that
deprive
it
of
its
navigable
character?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
bradley
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
while
you're
on
that
point
may
i
ask,
suppose
this
--
this
work
had
been
done,
was
being
done
on
the
shoreline
of
the
mississippi
river
itself
and
this
man
worked
under
the
identical
conditions
that
he
--
he
works
under
here.
would
he
be
--
would
he
be
subject
to
the
jones
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
your
position?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
it's
a
character
of
the
--
of
the
work
and
of
the
dredge
itself
and
its
relationship
to
the
river
that
--
that
makes
those
men
ineligible.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
justice
black
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
think
he
has
a
question
he
wanted
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
proceed.
