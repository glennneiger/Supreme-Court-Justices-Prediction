justice
john
m.
harlan
isn't
the
test
under
the
jones
act
not
whether
he's
a
seaman
but
whether
he's
a
member
of
the
crew?
justice
john
m.
harlan
maybe
a
seaman
and
subject
to
the
longshoreman's
act
but
not
a
member
of
the
crew
subject
to
the
jones
act,
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
this
court
said
that
be
a
member
of
a
crew,
you
have
to
be
the
kind
of
a
crewmember
that
aides
the
navigation
of
a
vessel?
justice
john
m.
harlan
isn't
the
real
thing
that
was
going
on
here,
not
that
they
were
on
navigable
waters
but
that
they
were
trying
to
make
them
navigable
cuts
so
that
people
could
use
it,
boats
could
use
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
say
--
pardon
me.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
just
going
to
ask
you,
do
you
make
--
do
you
say
that
it's
not
a
question
for
the
jury
at
all
as
to
whether
he
comes
--
whether
a
particular
individual
comes
in
down
there,
it's
a
matter
of
law
for
the
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
simply
saying
that
although
the
questions
--
the
jury
question,
there
wasn't
sufficient
evidence
to
justify
the
jury
review.
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
that
there
wasn't
enough
evidence
to
submit
it
to
the
jury,
is
that
your
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you
--
you
don't
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
question
of
status
as
a
crew
member
is
not
a
question
for
the
jury
at
all
but
a
question
for
the
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
but
you
put
in
the
qualification
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
said,
i
wouldn?t
even
care
for
that
definition
(inaudible)
