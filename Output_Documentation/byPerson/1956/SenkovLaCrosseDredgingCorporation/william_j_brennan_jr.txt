justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
is
that
the
kind
of
crew,
a
standard
set
of
--
type
of
crew
for
the
dredge
in
this
character?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
any
question
here
that
--
whether
the
dredge
was
a
vessel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
see
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
do
i
get
then
that
even
if
it
was
proper
to
say
that
this
dredge
was
in
navigation,
yet
the
fact
that
this
injury
occurred
on
land
would
bar
a
recovery,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
a
finding
that
this
dredge
was
in
navigation
was
testified
on
the
record,
would
you
nevertheless
claim
that
the
petitioner
was
barred
from
recovery
because
the
accident
happened
on
land?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
is
the
--
in
your
view
is
the
real
--
is
the
controlling
issue
here
whether
the
--
this
dredge
was
in
navigation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at.
then
if
the
vessel
was
in
navigation
and
he
was
doing
something
connected
with
that
navigation,
nevertheless,
you
have
an
argument
that
he
would
not
be
entitled
to
recover
because
he
was
not
a
seaman?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
the
fact
that
he
was
doing
something
in
navigation
would
not
of
itself
make
himself
--
make
him
a
seaman,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
can
any
of
the
members
of
these
four
men
crew
qualify
as
seaman
under
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
speaking
only
of
him.
are
the
other
three
members
of
the
crew
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
then
is
that
when
he
put
this
dredge
on
the
mississippi
instead
of
where
it
was,
is
that
under
no
circumstances
could
any
member
of
that
crew
of
the
dredge
qualify
in
the
act
as
seaman?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
is
that
consistent
then
with
this
being
a
vessel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
you've
said,
when
i
asked
you
earlier,
that
there's
no
question
that
this
dredge
is
a
vessel
for
the
purposes
of
the
statute
or
did
i
misunderstand
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
may
be
but
as
i
--
as
i
now
understand
you,
there
never
could
be
an
employee
on
one
of
these
dredges,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
act
makes
a
dredge
a
vessel
who
could
qualify
under
the
act
because
none
of
them
cannot
make
--
can
never
be
a
seaman.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
makes
it
rather
futile
for
the
congress
to
have
said
this
will
be
a
vessel,
doesn't
it?
