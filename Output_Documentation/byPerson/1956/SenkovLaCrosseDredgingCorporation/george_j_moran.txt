mr.
george
j.
moran
may
it
please
the
court.
this
suit
was
brought
pursuant
to
title
46,
section
68
--
688
of
the
united
states
code
annotated
which
provided
or
provides
that
any
seaman
who
shall
suffer
personal
injuries
in
the
course
of
his
employment
shall
have
a
remedy
therefore
if
there's
negligence
on
his
employer
or
his
fellow
servants
and
all
of
the
rights
that
railroad
employees
have
shall
extend
to
the
seaman.
now,
jacob
senko
files
suit
in
the
city
court
of
granite
city,
illinois
alleging
that
the
defendant
was
the
owner
and
the
operator
of
a
dredge
called
the
james
wilkinson
and
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
crew
and
a
deckhand
on
that
dredge.
he
further
alleged
that
the
dredge
was
plying
on
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
on
the
5th
day
of
november
in
the
year
1951
and
that
was
he
was
injured
through
the
negligence
of
the
defendant.
the
case
was
tried
on
res
ipsa
loquitur
theory
and
trial
was
had
and
the
jury
rendered
the
verdict
in
the
city
court
in
the
amount
of
$30,000
which
was
reduced
by
remittitur
to
$20,000
and
then
judgement
was
entered
by
the
court
on
the
verdict
of
the
jury.
now,
after
that
judgement
was
entered,
the
case
was
appealed
to
the
appellate
court
for
the
fourth
district
on
several
grounds
but
mainly
the
fact
that
senko
being
a
land
lover
could
not
be
a
member
of
the
crew
of
a
vessel
and
therefore
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
jury
had
no
right
to
bring
in
a
verdict
in
his
favor,
and
the
appellate
court
reversed
the
judgement
outright
on
the
ground
that
the
facts
being
undisputed
that
there
was
only
one
conclusion
to
draw
from
the
facts
and
that
was
that
senko
could
not
recover
because
he
didn't
bring
himself
within
the
definition
of
a
member
of
a
crew
of
a
vessel
operating
on
navigable
waters.
now,
the
james
wilkinson
operated
with
a
crew
of
four.
mr.
george
j.
moran
i
am
not
able
to
determine
whether
the
finding
was
based
upon
facts
particularly
that
he
was
not
a
member
of
the
crew
nor
the
fact
that
it
was
in
navigable
waters
or
that
the
ship
was
in
navigation.
i
mean
the
appellate
court
went
in
and
i
was
going
to
get
that,
i
can
explain
it
now,
your
honor,
if
you
want
that
i
--
mr.
george
j.
moran
all
right.
mr.
george
j.
moran
the
--
the
vessel
operated
with
a
crew
of
four.
there
was
an
engineer
who
operated
the
dredge
--
who
took
care
of
the
machinery
on
the
dredge,
there
was
an
operator
who
operated
the
levers
that
ran
the
spuds
and
the
--
and
the
anchors
which
moved
the
dredge
above.
and
then
there
was
an
oiler
who
oiled
the
machinery
and
then
there
was
senko,
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
now,
all
of
the
work
that
was
done
on
the
dredge
and
the
evidence
clearly
shows
that,
which
was
not
connected
with
the
machinery,
was
done
by
senko.
mr.
george
j.
moran
well,
i
believe
that's
true,
your
honor.
i
mean
the
--
generally
the
--
i
imagine
some
dredges
might
have
a
larger
crew,
they
all
carry
what
we
call
--
what
the
respondent
calls
a
laborer
and
we
call
a
deckhand.
now,
all
the
elements
necessary
to
determine
whether
his
status
was
submitted
to
the
jury
by
instructions
tendered
by
the
defendant.
the
defendant
tendered
an
instruction
on
--
and
a
definition
of
navigable
water.
the
--
and
that
was
given
by
the
trial
court.
the
trial
court
also
gave
a
--
gave
a
definition
of
--
of
a
member
of
a
crew
and
told
the
jury
that
he
had
to
be
a
member
of
a
crew
of
a
vessel
operating
on
navigable
waters
in
order
for
--
in
order
to
recover.
so,
this
case,
after
it
was
reversed,
we
filed
a
petition
for
leave
to
appeal
with
the
illinois
supreme
court,
the
petition
for
leave
to
appeal
was
denied
and
thereafter,
we
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
with
this
court
and
the
certiorari
was
granted
on
may
the
28th,
1956.
now,
the
evidence
in
this
case
showed
that
for
about
year
prior
to
the
time
of
this
incident
that
senko
was
attached
to
the
dredge,
james
wilkinson,
exclusively
that
he
was
a
deckhand
and
they
termed
him
so
as
a
deckhand,
that
is
his
witnesses
did,
some
of
the
witnesses
and
that
the
only
time
that
he
went
ashore
was
on
duties
for
the
ship.
in
other
words,
he
had
certain
duties
on
the
ship
but
sometimes
when
they
were
dredge
--
when
they
had
this
dredging
operation,
he
would
have
to
go
to
a
shore
to
deliver
lanterns
or
to
get
supplies
or
do
those
sort
of
things.
and
in
addition
to
that,
he
operated
the
small
motor,
the
rowboat
back
and
forth
to
the
shore.
and
while
he
was
doing
that,
he
had
to
wear
to
a
lifejacket,
that
was
government
regulations.
he's
filled
the
water
cooler
under
--
on
there
and
he
took
on
the
supplies,
took
off
the
supplies
and
he
cleaned
up
the
dredge.
he
kept
the
dredge
shipshape
and
he
also
--
there's
some
testimony
in
there
about
him
splicing
rope.
and
two
witnesses
who
are
in
the
record
testified
clearly
that
his
duties
were
confined
to
the
dredge
and
that's
all
the
work
that
he
did
was
on
the
dredge
except
when
he
was
going
off
the
dredge
on
dredge
business.
now,
the
james
wilkinson
had
been
dredging
in
the
canal
south
of
block
27
for
about
a
year
prior
to
the
accident,
in
a
place
called
gabaret
chute
or
gabaret
slough.
mr.
george
j.
moran
yes,
he
was
operating
right
in
that
particular
area.
it
was
a
place
of
about
a
mile
from
the
south
mouth
of
that
canal
up
there
and
this
--
it
was
a
part
of
an
army
engineer
plan
to
make
the
mississippi
river
more
navigable
as
a
whole.
mr.
george
j.
moran
well,
it
could
--
the
--
the
water
was
300
feet
wide
at
that
space
and
from
the
south
edge
of
the
lock
down
to
the
mouth
of
the
--
of
the
channel
was
a
mile
and
it
was
dredging
out,
making
deeper
this
channel
so
that
the
--
that
this
area
could
be
made
more
navigable.
the
idea
was
that
the
army
engineers
wanted
to
avoid
the
chain
of
rocks
bridge
of
the
mississippi
river
which
at
certain
times
of
the
year
became
low
and
the
vessels
couldn't
navigate
up
and
down
the
river
because
of
that.
now,
senko
at
the
time
he
testified,
testified
that
as
among
his
duties
were
taking
soundings
and
when
he
took
these
soundings,
he
took
soundings
prior
to
november
of
1951
and
that
the
depth
of
the
water
when
he
took
the
soundings
were
from
between
18
to
22
to
24
feet
or
right
around
there.
another
witness,
william
trojan
testified
that
at
the
time
this
happened
and
prior
thereto
he
was
assistant
lock
master
and
that
he
took
soundings
in
august
prior
to
the
time
of
this
happening
and
that
from
the
south
mouth
of
the
canal
all
the
way
up
the
south
gate
of
this
lock
that
was
almost
completed,
that
the
depth,
the
minimum
depth
was
10
feet
and
he
also
said
that
the
water
was
deeper
in
november
than
it
was
in
august.
so
--
and
there
was
some
testimony
that
prior
to
1951,
from
1946
to
1951
that
boats
moved
in
and
out
of
this
canal
up
to
where
the
dredge
was
and
in
and
out
of
the
south
mouth
of
this
canal,
government
boats,
the
supply
boats,
they
move
the
concrete
plant
in
and
out
of
there.
they
had
built
a
supply
dock
in
there
in
1946
and
ships
and
supplies
in
and
out
and
that
the
locks,
although
not
open
to
the
public
at
that
time,
the
locks
that
were
being
built
in
this
gabaret
chute
or
gabaret
slough
had
been
operated
prior
to
november
with
temporary
controls
for
a
period
of
a
week
and
on
--
on
different
occasions
and
that
they
operated
these
when
they
brought
some
bulkheads
in,
they
were
200
feet
long
with
tenders
to
do
that.
and
that
the
wilkinson
itself
was
floated
through
the
south
mouth
of
this
canal
when
it
first
started
this
dredging
operation
at
the
south
mouth
of
gabaret
chute,
we
might
say,
what
they
were
dredging
out.
it
was
floated
through
a
dredge
tender.
now,
prior
to
the
time
that
the
army
engineers
ever
came
in
here
in
1946
--
mr.
george
j.
moran
dredge
tender.
mr.
george
j.
moran
a
dredge
tender,
yes,
sir.
and
prior
to
1946,
this
slough
had
been
used
by
public
for
years
and
years
and
years.
the
slough
was
about
four
or
five
feet
long
and
then
practically
parallel
with
the
mississippi
river
and
the
--
it
--
it
entered
in
--
in
came
into
the
--
left
the
mississippi
river
at
one
point
and
joined
it
again
at
another
point,
it
ran
generally
north
and
south.
and
there
was
evidence
in
the
record
that
one
--
one
witness,
saunders,
testified
that
when
he
was
a
boy,
25
years
ago
or
so,
that
he
used
to
use
this
particular
slough
or
chute
as
a
shortcut
in
returning
to
home
from
saint
louis.
there's
also
testimony
that
there
was
a
ferry
operated
across
there
from
the
mainland
over
to
the
--
over
to
the
gabaret
island
and
that
they
hauled
horses
and
mules
and
things
like
that.
and
also
that
folks
went
across
back
and
forth
across
this
slough.
in
fact,
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
reply
brief,
this
particular
slough
was
made
the
subject
of
litigation
over
20
years
ago
where
a
couple
of
horses
or
mules
fell
in
there
and
the
court
at
that
time,
all
it
wanted
was
the
navigability
was
involved,
pointed
out
that
the
record
showed
that
it
was
300
feet
wide
at
that
time
and
20
feet
deep
in
places.
and
another
thing
i
think
we
should
remember
particularly
in
this
case,
we're
talking
about
the
navigability.
this
record
is
replete
with
evidence
that
as
the
slough
rose,
so
with
the
mississippi
and
vice
versa.
that
the
water
in
the
mississippi
and
the
water
in
the
gabaret
slough
were
interchangeable
and
that
when
water
in
the
mississippi
--
when
the
mississippi
was
low,
the
slough
would
be
row
--
low
or
when
the
mississippi
was
high,
the
slough
would
be
high.
now,
the
dredge
was
a
136
feet
long,
36
feet
wide,
carried
its
own
power
equipment
and
it
operated
by
the
use
of
two
spuds
and
anchors.
and
it
was
on
these
set
of
facts
and
it's
out
of
this
evidence
before
them
that
the
appellate
court
for
the
fourth
district
reversed
the
jury's
finding
of
fact
and
found
that
the
plaintiff
was
not
under
the
jones
act.
the
court
said,
"this
court
therefore
holds
as
a
general
proposition,
an
employee
whose
principal
duty
is
to
load
supplies
on
a
vessel
at
anchor
and
to
perform
incidental
tasks
of
a
common
laborer
character
and
who
is
not
primarily
at
work
to
aid
in
navigation
cannot
maintain
an
action
under
the
jones
act."
the
court
again
says
further
as
to
this
particular
case,
it
being
undisputed
that
plaintiff
lived
and
boarded
ashore,
worked
the
hours
of
a
laborer,
only
was
--
was
paid
only
by
the
hour,
had
the
primary
duty
of
loading
supplies
and
material
on
and
of
--
and
of
performing
various
other
common
labor
task
and
who
is
not
employed
in
moving
the
vessel
from
place
to
place
and
was
not
aboard
except
when
the
vessel
was
anchored
that
he
cannot
maintain
an
action
under
the
jones
act.
further,
that
the
provision
of
law
making
the
compensation
act
the
exclusively
remedy
of
employees
on
vessels
other
than
masters
and
members
of
the
crew,
cannot
be
evaded
by
asserting
that
a
jury's
notion
of
what
law
should
be
applied
nullifies
that
provision
where
there
is
no
substantial
dispute
as
to
the
facts.
the
reasoning
used
by
the
appellate
court
therefore
makes
it
clear
that
what
was
behind
this
decision
was
a
basic
disagreement
with
the
law
that
a
dredge
when
dredging
is
in
navigation
and
under
maritime
law.
for
example,
the
court
said
that
the
dredge
had
to
use
arms
or
poles
or
spuds
to
make
its
position
more
secure
as
the
primary
anchorage
and
it
used
anchorage
there
in
a
term
of
a
ship
being
anchored
of
any
other
type
of
ship
and
but
not
in
--
in
terms
of
when
its
anchored
that
the
dredge
is
actually
doing
its
work.
they
also
referred
to
the
petitioner
as
being
a
person
who
is
only
aboard
when
the
ship
is
anchored.
now,
under
this
reasoning,
no
dredge
when
doing
its
job
could
be
engaged
in
navigation
and
no
person
aboard
a
dredge,
such
as
this
appellate
court
describes,
could
be
a
seaman
because
under
this
reasoning,
the
dredge
being
in
--
in
anchor
could
not
be
in
navigation.
as
we
contended
when
we
filed
our
petition
to
leave
--
for
relief
to
appeal
with
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
that
this
case
flew
into
the
faces
of
the
federal
law
on
this
subject
and
the
federal
cases.
mr.
george
j.
moran
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
true.
that
is
the
--
and
that
--
mr.
george
j.
moran
that's
true
for
those
temporary
employees,
he
can
be
--
who
--
who
load
and
unload
vessels
and
the
test
is
whether
he's
a
seaman
or
a
member
of
the
crew
and
--
and
that
test,
if
there's
any
evidence
upon
which
a
jury
can
base
its
verdict,
is
a
question
of
fact
for
the
jury
as
i
understand
the
law.
mr.
george
j.
moran
yes,
but
they've
also
said
that
a
dredge
boat
when
operating
and
performing
its
function
of
dredging
is
navigating.
in
other
words,
a
dredge
was
designed
to
operate
with
two
anchors
and
two
spuds.
the
spuds
are
large,
about
55
foot
metal
round
objects
which
go
down
under
the
bed
of
the
stream
where
they're
navigating
and
the
two
anchors
go
on
to
the
starboard
and
one
to
the
port
out
and
with
these
two
anchors
they
put
--
they
put
pressure
on
one
anchor
and
one
spot
and
they
maneuver
the
dredge
all
over
the
stream
wherever
they
may
be
dredging
and
in
--
and
--
and
do
that
and
they
perform
the
very
function
for
which
the
dredge
was
operated
or
was
designed.
now,
in
the
event
that
we
say
that
that
is
not
navigation,
then
we
must
say
that
when
a
dredge
is
performing
the
work
for
which
the
vessel
was
designed,
it
is
not
in
navigation
and
as
a
far
as
work
and
as
--
as
far
as
the
law
is
concerned,
it
wouldn't
be
a
vessel
such
as
it's
contemplated
to
be
in
navigation
under
the
--
under
the
maritime
law.
mr.
george
j.
moran
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that's
true.
that
--
we
--
we
say
this
that
if
the
--
if
the
water
was
available
for
navigation
and
susceptible
to
navigation
in
the
future,
it
could
have
made
navigable
by
reasonable
expense
and
effort
that
it
would
still
be
navigable.
but
we
maintain
that
for
a
number
of
years
prior
to
this
that
boats
went
in
and
out
of
there
and
when
those
boats
went
in
and
out
of
there,
the
first
one,
when
the
dredge
tender
floated
through
there
that
that
became
navigable
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
according
to
even
their
own
definition
in
their
brief,
the
daniel
ball
case,
if
a
--
if
a
stream
water
is
navigable,
in
fact
it
is
navigable
in
law.
in
the
appalachian
power
case,
it
extends
the
--
the
definition
of
navigability
to
say
that
reasonable
effort
can
be
expended,
then
a
stream
is
a
navigable.in
addition
to
that,
we
say
that
this
water
had
become
navigable
by
usage
in
the
past
and
that
there
was
and
incidentally,
your
honor,
this
also,
in
our
opinion,
is
a
question
of
fact
to
the
jury.
but
it
had
been
--
yet
it's
been
--
had
become
navigable
in
the
past
by
long
usage
and
by
this
very
reason,
things
have
went
back
and
forth,
but
this
man
using
and
people
using
it
go
back
upstream.
it's
historically
a
navigable
stream,
it's
a
tributary
--
tributary
to
the
mississippi
river
which
had
been
used
in
the
past.and
once
being
navigable,
once
it
is
navigable,
it's
presumed
to
be
navigable
in
the
future
--
long
--
as
i
understand
the
law,
long
continued
disuse
of
the
stream
would
not
make
it
become
unnavigable.
so,
we
say
that
under
the
cases,
gianfala
case
and
the
cases
cited
therein
and
under
the
south
chicago
coal
&
dock
case
which
the
appellate
court
used
to
reverse
this
case,
that
this
case
was
a
question
of
fact
for
the
jury
that
the
navigability
was
a
question
of
fact
for
the
jury,
that
the
question
whether
the
ship
was
navigating
was
a
question
of
fact
to
jury,
that
the
question
whether
the
man
was
a
member
or
crew
was
a
question
of
fact
to
the
jury.
and
if
there
was
an
evidentiary
basis
for
this
judgement,
it
should
stand.
we
feel
that
the
evidence
in
this
case
was
so
strong
that
there
was
hardly
an
evidentiary
basis
for
not
holding
him
a
member
of
a
crew.
