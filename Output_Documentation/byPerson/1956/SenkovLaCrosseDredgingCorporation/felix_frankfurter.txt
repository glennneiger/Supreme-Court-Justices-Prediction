justice

mr.
bradley,
i'm
left
in
some
doubt
by
--
over
the
answers
you
gave
to
the
questions
of
the
court.
what
i
--
i
got
the
impression
--
doubt
miserroneously
that
you
admitted,
that
you
conceded
that
a
vehicle
may
be
a
vessel
under
the
statute
--
under
the
federal
statute
but
none
of
the
operating
members
of
that
vessel
would
be
members
of
a
crew,
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i
want
to
know
before
you
explain
it,
what
makes
--
and
therefore
the
next
thing
that
this
particular
vehicle,
this
particular
bridge
is
a
vessel
under
the
statute.
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is
under
what
statute,
what
makes
this
a
vessel
under
what
statute?
what
is
the
statute?
would
you
mind
referring
me
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
drawing
the
conclusion,
i
just
wanted
to
get
clear
in
my
mind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you've
got
the
words?
what
did
it
say?
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
for
what
purpose
--
to
what
situation
is
that
definition
applicable?
i
can
well
understand
that
a
thing
may
be
a
vessel
for
one
purpose
and
not
for
another.
now,
to
what
does
that
definition
apply?
you
say
it
doesn't
apply
to
the
jones
act,
is
that
right?
so
what
does
it
apply?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
is
it
a
vessel
under
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
does
it
say,
is
it
something
that
navigates?
well,
if
it
navigates
then
the
people
who
--
who
operate
the
navigation,
why
aren't
they
members
of
the
crew?
that's
where
i
get
trouble
--
the
trouble.
i
don't
understand
that
it's
something
satisfied
description
of
being
an
instrument
that
navigates,
that
those
who
navigate
--
those
who
navigate
it
aren't
navigating
and
therefore
members
of
the
crew.
i
still
--
i
still
understand
your
position
that
that
doesn't
necessarily
make
them
liable
or
beneficiaries
under
the
jones
act,
but
--
but
i
--
i'd
like
to
have
that
cleared
up
if
you
can.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
a
man
meaning
be
aboard
in
order
to
become
a
member
of
a
crew,
but
what
i
take
from
you
unless
you
clarify
me
more
than
you
have
is
how
a
thing
can
be
a
navigating
thing
without
the
people
who
bring
about
the
navigation,
being
members
of
a
crew.
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
it
isn't
a
vessel
within
that
definition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
all
mixed
up,
how
a
thing
can
be
a
navigating
thing
and
not
as
though
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
navigating.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
it
isn't
--
then
it
doesn't
come
within
the
definition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
can
you
tell
me
what
a
vessel
is?
can
you
tell
me
what
the
characteristics?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
order
to
constitute
a
vessel,
isn't
that
right?
just
merely
give
the
characteristics
of
what
constitutes
a
vessel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
follow
therefrom
that
this
thing
was
a
vessel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
quite
my
thought.
i'm
asking
what
--
whether
the
statute,
just
by
reading
any
statute
and
to
find
out
whether
it
is
straight
toward
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
they
are
bound
and
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
your
position
is
that,
if
i
just
read
this
at
--
i
just
consider
and
mindful
with
that
definition
i
would
know
that
this
created
a
vessel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
wouldn't
discourage
thinking
about
that,
would
you?
