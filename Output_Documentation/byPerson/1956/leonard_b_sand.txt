mr.
sand
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
first
like
to
direct
myself
to
the
question
of
double
jeopardy
apart
from
the
unappealed
conviction
for
arson.
and
i
would
like
to
answer
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
whether
it
would
be
necessary
for
the
court
to
overrule
trono,
were
to
reverse
in
this
case.
and
it
is
the
government's
position
that
it
would
be
necessary
for
the
court
to
overrule
trono
but
the
converse
is
--
is
not
true.
it
would
not
be
necessary
for
the
court
to
accept
the
full
ramifications
of
the
trono
decision
to
affirm
here
because
there
are
peculiar
unique
facts
in
this
case
which
make
it
an
even
clearer
case,
an
a
fortiorari
case
for
holding
that
a
conviction
for
a
lesser
included
offense
does
not
bar
retrial
for
the
greater
offense.
there
are
four
such
factors,
the
government
believes
present
here.
the
first
of
these
is
the
very
basis
for
the
reversal
of
the
first
conviction
and
that
is
the
defendant's
contention
that
is
conduct
at
the
first
trial
was
first
degree
murder
or
nothing.
it
was
apparent
then
that
a
free
trial
was
to
be
had.
it
could
only
be
for
first
degree
murder.
this
--
this
was
made
very
explicit
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
indeed
it
was
made
clear
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
opinion
in
which
they
reversed
the
first
conviction.
there
appears
at
page
172
and
173
of
the
record
which
is
the
opinion
of
the
court
below,
the
following.
the
court
were
--
we
were
concerned
however,
that
the
obvious
risk
which
green
was
running
in
successfully
appealing
from
the
second
degree
murder
conviction.
but
we
were
assured
he
was
aware
of
it.
with
respect
to
this,
we
said
in
the
opinion,
referring
to
the
opinion
reversing
the
second
degree
murder
conviction.
in
seeking
a
new
trial
which
if
the
evidence
is
substantially
as
before,
the
jury
will
have
no
choice
except
to
find
him
guilty
of
first
degree
murder
or
to
acquit
him.
green
is
manifestly
taking
a
desperate
chance.
he
may
suffer
the
death
penalty.
mr.
sand
yes,
your
honor,
the
felony
murder
statute
provides
for
a
mandatory
death
penalty.
i
think
your
honor
may
be
thinking
of
the
statute
which
was
involved
in
the
--
in
the
mallory
case.
mr.
sand
that
--
that
was
the
rigg
statute
where
there
is
a
--
a
--
mr.
sand
--
the
power
in
the
jury
to
recommend
--
make
a
recommendation
with
respect
to
the
imposition
of
sentence.
mr.
sand
the
--
the
statute
enumerates
the
felonies
in
the
perpetration
of
which
a
murder
may
--
may
be
committed
which
is
a
felony
murder
and
arson
is
the
first
of
those
enumerated
felonies.
mr.
sand
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
sand
the
court
of
appeals
then
in
the
opinion
which
it
reversed
the
second
degree
murder
conviction
stated,
"at
oral
argument,
we
inquired
of
his
counsel
whether
green
clearly
understood
the
possible
consequences
of
success
on
this
appeal
and
we
were
told
that
the
appellant
who
is
64
years
of
age
says,
he
prefers
death
suspending
the
rest
of
his
life
in
prison."
he
is
entitled
to
a
new
trial.
and
so
it
was
as
explicit
as
it
could
possibly
be
that
the
new
trial
which
petitioner
was
seeking
in
appealing
from
his
conviction
was
to
be
a
trial
for
first
degree
murder.
mr.
sand
if
it
they
would
present,
indeed
it
would,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
if
--
mr.
sand
--
if
--
mr.
sand
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
the
--
mr.
sand
that
--
the
hypothetical
as
--
as
your
honor
presented
it,
assumed
that
the
advice
which
was
given
to
the
--
to
the
petitioner
before
he
--
he
made
the
statement
was
an
erroneous
statement
of
the
law.
and
so
there
was
a
--
there
was
a
statement
which
was
based
on
that
erroneous
assumption.
it's
the
government
--
mr.
sand
i
think
--
mr.
sand
i
--
i
think
that
--
that
it
is
confusing.
it
befuddles
the
issue
to
--
to
talk
in
terms
of
waiver.
because
what
we're
really
concerned
with
is
what
legal
consequences
will
attach
where
a
prior
conviction
is
reversed.
i
make
reference
to
this
merely
to
show
that
the
grounds
for
reversal
here
were
unique.
here,
petitioner
was
saying,
"my
conduct,
proven
at
the
first
trial
was
not
a
lesser
offense.
it
was
a
greater
offense."
then
he
states,
"because
of
this,
i
cannot
be
retried
at
all
because
i
cannot
be
retried
for
a
second
degree
murder.
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
my
conduct
did
not
constitute
second
degree
murder."
in
effect,
petitioner
is
now
saying,
"the
consequence
of
my
appealing
the
conviction
is
that
i
attained
an
immunity."
mr.
sand
i
think
that
under
this
indictment
which
contained
no
allegation
with
respect
to
intent,
a
verdict
of
second
degree
murder
could
not
properly
be
returned
because
this
--
mr.
sand
it
is
not
under
this
indictment
but
under
the
statute.
you
--
there
are
situations
--
mr.
sand
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
sand
yes.
mr.
sand
it
--
it
would
not
be
proper
to
return
a
verdict
of
a
second
degree
murder
under
this
indictment.
mr.
sand
this
--
mr.
sand
he
asked
in
the
--
his
appeal
brief
in
the
--
on
--
on
the
first
appeal.
he
asked
merely
that
the
judgment
be
reversed.
he
did
not
specifically
state
what
consequences
be
desired
to
follow
from
that.
mr.
sand
this
was
at
oral
argument
on
the
first
appeal.
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
has
reference
to
--
mr.
sand
--
to
a
colloquy
at
oral
argument
on
the
first
appeal.
mr.
sand
not
--
mr.
sand
--
not
on
the
first
appeal,
your
honor.
mr.
sand
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
the
opinion
of
the
court
both
on
the
first
appeal
and
on
the
second
appeal.
a
second
fact,
the
peculiar
to
this
case
is
as
--
as
i
suggested.
it
is
impossible
to
retry
the
defendant
for
second
degree
murder.
it
is
the
established
law
that
an
appeal
is
a
waiver
of
jeopardy
and
that
one
may
be
retried
following
such
an
appeal.
but
as
i've
said,
petitioner
here
is
saying
that
the
effect
of
the
appeal
should
be
to
grant
him
an
immunity.
mr.
sand
i
--
i
think
the
answer
is
yes,
your
honor
but
i
--
i
have
to
qualify.
before
the
jury
could
return
the
verdict
for
robbery,
there
would
have
to
be
an
instruction
by
the
trial
judge
that
that
was
permissible
verdict.
mr.
sand
it
was
an
erroneous
instruction.
therefore,
the
government
asks
that
on
retrial,
that
the
trial
be
had
free
from
that
erroneous
instruction.
the
petitioner
wishes
to
perpetuate
the
error.
he
says
it
was
error
to
instruct
the
jury
at
the
first
trial
that
i
could
be
found
guilty
of
second
degree
murder.
therefore,
if
retried,
i
can
be
retried
only
for
a
second
degree
murder.
mr.
sand
well
i
--
i
think
and
--
and
that
takes
me
to
the
third
peculiar
factor
of
this
case.
i
think
it
is
totally
unrealistic
to
view
the
first
verdict
as
an
implied
accquital.
there
were
two
counts,
a
count
of
arson
and
a
--
a
murder
count.
the
defendant
was
convicted
of
arson
at
the
first
trial.
he
was
also
convicted
of
second
degree
murder.
the
only
evidence
as
to
the
death,
the
cause
of
the
death
of
the
victim
was
that
it
was
as
a
result
of
petitioner's
arson.
therefore,
even
in
the
verdict
of
the
first
jury,
one
has
all
the
essential
elements
of
first
degree
murder.
now,
the
jury
returned
the
verdict
of
second
degree
murder
which
they
were
told
they
might
return.
and
in
view
of
the
mandatory
death
sentence
and
the
fact
that
this
is
a
very
hard
case,
it
is
entirely
reasonable
to
suppose
that
--
that
considerations
of
--
of
sympathy
led
the
jury
to
return
that
verdict,
but
it
is
--
it
is
not
realistic
to
say
that
the
defendant
was
acquitted
of
murder.
indeed,
this
court
has
said
with
respect
to
the
district
of
columbia
murder
statute
in
the
fisher
case
that
there
is
really
but
one
crime
of
murder
and
that
the
difference
between
first
degree
murder
and
second
degree
murder
really
relate
to
the
grades
of
punishment.
and
so,
this
case
becomes
indeed
like
the
stroud
case
where
the
jury
--
mr.
sand
like
the
stroud
case,
if
your
honor
please,
in
251
u.s.
there,
the
defendant
was
convicted
three
times.
the
first
time,
the
verdict
was
simply
guilty
of
murder.
the
second
time,
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty
of
murder
without
capital
punishment,
the
statute
there
being
like
the
district
of
columbia
rape
statute
permitting
the
jury
to
make
such
a
recommendation.
that
conviction
was
reversed.
the
third
time,
the
jury
as
did
the
first
jury,
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty
of
murder
and
the
death
penalty
was
imposed.
the
contention
was
made
to
this
court
that
that
was
a
violation
of
due
process
--
excuse
me,
a
violation
of
double
jeopardy.
and
this
court
wrote,
"the
only
thing
that
the
appellate
court
could
do
was
to
award
a
new
trial
on
finding
error
in
the
proceeding."
thus,
the
plaintiff
in
error
himself
invoked
the
action
of
the
court
which
resulted
in
a
further
trial.
in
such
cases,
he
is
not
placed
in
second
jeopardy
within
the
meaning
of
the
constitution
and
the
court
cited
trono.
with
respect
to
the
questioning
of
--
of
sentence,
of
--
of
imposition
of
sentence
by
a
trial
judge,
this
court
wrote
in
bozza
against
the
united
states
in
330
u.s.
that
the
constitution
does
not
require
that
sentencing
should
be
a
game
in
which
a
wrong
move
by
the
judge
means
immunity
for
the
prisoner.
the
government
submits
here
that
that
reasoning
applies
and
that
the
wrong
move
by
the
judge,
the
instruction
that
the
jury
at
the
first
trial
could
return
a
verdict
of
second
degree
murder
should
not
confer
an
immunity
upon
the
--
the
petitioner.
mr.
sand
yes,
your
honor
because
the
--
the
government
could
not
appeal.
but
he
--
but
he
did
--
but
he
did
take
an
appeal
and
the
error
which
was
corrected
is
an
error
which
operated
to
the
prejudice
of
the
first
trial
of
both
the
government
and
the
defendant.
that
the
error
in
instructing
the
jury
that
they
could
return
a
verdict
of
second
degree
murder
was
that
it
--
it
permitted
a
compromised
verdict.
mr.
sand
this
--
this
is
indeed
a
special
case.
mr.
sand
justice
holmes'
view
of
course,
would
--
would
lead
to
an
infirmancy
because
this
is
not
a
--
mr.
sand
the
--
the
only
theory
upon
which
double
jeopardy
can
be
invoked
by
the
petitioner
is
to
read
the
first
verdict
as
an
implied
acquittal
of
first
degree
murder.
i
suggest
that
because
of
the
peculiar
facts
here
that
that
cannot
be
done,
the
conviction
of
murder,
the
finding
of
all
the
essential
elements
of
first
degree
murder.
mr.
sand
and
--
mr.
sand
and
the
consequence
of
the
reversal
of
that
conviction
is
to
wipe
the
entire
slate
clean.
mr.
sand
the
--
the
other
result
leads
to
this
fallacious
reasoning.
if
you
limit
the
second
trial
to
second
degree
murder,
you
then
say,
because
of
the
presumption
of
innocence,
there
is
no
valid
finding
that
the
defendant
killed
the
victim
but
there
is
a
finding
that
if
he
killed
the
victim,
he
did
so
in
the
absence
of
circumstances
which
make
it
first
degree
murder.
mr.
sand
i
have
to
say
that,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
to
make
this
an
a
fortiorari
case
from
trono.
but
in
trono,
there
was
an
explicit
finding
by
the
court
the
first
instance
of
acquittal
for
the
greater
offense
and
that
--
that
is
made
much
of
by
the
dissenting
justices
in
that
case
that
there,
there
was
an
explicit
acquittal.
here,
i
--
i
submit
to
the
court,
there
is
not
even
an
implied
acquittal
because
of
--
of
the
peculiar
facts
in
this
case.
mr.
sand
not
entirely.
because
justice
peckham
also
said,
quoting
from
page
27
of
the
government's
brief,
"that
the
judgment
is
one
entire
thing
and
it
brings
up
the
whole
record
for
review."
he
then
said
he
thereby
waives
the
benefit
of
the
provision
in
question.
but
putting
to
one
side
the
theory
of
waiver.
if
we
say
that
when
one
reverses
a
conviction,
he
does
not
remove
only
so
much
of
that
error
as
prejudiced
him
but
he
removes
all
of
the
error
both
that
that
which
operated
to
his
benefit
and
that
which
operated
to
his
detriment,
then
conviction
for
the
greater
included
offense
is
--
is
permissible.
mr.
sand
literally,
it
doesn't.
as
your
honors
have
observed,
mr.
justice
story
for
--
mr.
sand
i
--
i
think
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
i
suggest
that
the
court
has
already
worked
out
such
a
rule
in
the
trono
case.
where
it
--
it
was
held
and
the
clear
language
of
the
opinion
which
followed
the
kepner
opinion
in
this
respect
was
that
its
holding
was,
as
if
the
case
arose
in
the
federal
court
in
the
united
states,
the
provision
being
identical
with
the
--
with
the
fifth
amendment
--
mr.
sand
--
provision.
mr.
sand
you
--
you
cannot
--
mr.
sand
--
read
trono
that
way.
mr.
sand
yes,
probably.
mr.
sand
to
--
mr.
sand
mr.
justice
frankfurter
i
can
only
say,
of
course
the
government
agrees.
mr.
sand
if
one
does
not
say
that
--
mr.
sand
--
the
appeal
and
the
reversal
of
the
conviction
is
a
--
is
a
waiver,
then
literally,
the
defendant
is
--
is
twice
in
jeopardy
for
that
offense.
but
--
but
nobody
contends
that
a
defendant
cannot
appeal
and
nobody
heretofore
has
contended
that
the
effect
of
a
reversal
of
a
conviction
is
to
preclude
a
--
a
retrial.
mr.
sand
i
--
i
--
mr.
sand
you
do,
and
the
question
is
how
far
that
breaches
to
go.
mr.
sand
and
whether
it
is
to
be
possible
for
a
defendant
to
urge
that
because
his
conduct
was
a
greater
crime
from
that
for
which
he
was
convicted,
he
may
not
be
tried
at
all
for
that
crime.
i
--
as
--
as
i
have
said
the
error
in
this
case
operated
both
to
the
prejudice
of
the
government
and
the
defendant
and
that
the
government
here
only
asks
that
that
--
that
a
new
trial
be
permitted
which
is
free
from
that
error.
in
this
respect,
the
language
of
mr.
justice
cardozo
in
the
palko
case
is
--
is
relevant
although
of
course
the
palko
case
was
a
state
case
and
dealt
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
due
process.
but
mr.
justice
cardozo
wrote
in
that
case,
"the
state
is
not
attempting
to
wear
the
accused
out
by
a
multitude
of
cases
with
accumulated
trials.
it
asks
no
more
than
this
that
the
case
against
him
go
on
until
there
shall
be
a
trial
free
from
the
corrosion
of
substantial
legal
error."
and
mr.
justice
cardozo
then
wrote,
"this
is
not
cruelty
at
all
nor
even
vexation
in
any
immoderate
degree."
and
this
is
--
mr.
sand
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
that
the
holding
in
palko
does
not.
i
think
that
--
mr.
sand
i
think
that
is
--
is
entirely
just
and
--
and
not
barred
by
the
double
jeopardy
provision
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
say
that
where
a
conviction
is
reversed
because
a
specific
error
was
committed
at
that
trial,
that
there
may
be
a
retrial
where
that
error
is
corrected.
that
is
all
--
mr.
sand
no,
i
--
i
was
not
--
mr.
sand
--
i
did
not
mean
to
suggest
by
my
reference
to
palko
that
this
was
a
question
of
anything
other
than
double
jeopardy
under
the
fifth
amendment.
i
--
i
thought
that
that
language,
although
it
--
it
was
in
a
different
context
was
relevant
here.
because
all
that
the
government
is
seeking
is
that
the
new
trial
be
a
trial
where
the
specific
error
committed
at
the
first
trial
was
corrected.
mr.
sand
the
government
has
not
collected
any
in
this
case.
mr.
sand
i
have
began
the
historical
approach
with
--
with
the
kepner
and
the
trono
decisions
and
ex
parte
lange
and
have
not
gone
beyond
that.
mr.
sand
of
course
mr.
justice
holmes,
in
--
in
the
trono
--
in
the
kepner
decision
does
state
that
the
origin
of
the
double
jeopardy
provision
was
to
prevent
subsequent
--
mr.
sand
--
new
trials.
mr.
sand
i
--
i
believe
that's
correct.
i'd
like
now
to
turn
to
the
question
of
the
unappealed
arson
conviction.
where
there
is
an
unappealed
conviction
for
a
lesser
included
offense,
it
is
clear
that
that
conviction
will
bar
a
subsequent
prosecution
for
the
greater
offense.
and
the
reason
for
this
is
that
at
the
trial,
the
second
trial
for
the
greater
offense,
the
jury
may
find
the
defendant
guilty
of
the
lesser
offense.
therefore,
he
is
twice
in
jeopardy
for
that
lesser
included
offense.
for
this
reasoning
to
be
applicable
here,
one
would
have
to
find
that
on
the
count
for
murder,
the
jury
could
have
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty
of
arson.
this
would
be
a
matter
of
--
in
the
first
instance
of
district
of
columbia
law,
and
in
wheeler
against
the
united
states
--
mr.
sand
yes.
mr.
sand
if
in
fact
arson
were
a
lesser
included
offense
in
the
--
in
the
crime
of
murder.
mr.
sand
no.
mr.
sand
it
is
not,
your
honor.
it
--
it
is
not
because
the
purpose
of
the
allegation
of
the
commission
of
felony
in
the
indictment
is
to
supply
the
element
of
--
of
intent,
of
premeditation.
originally,
there
was
but
one
crime
of
--
of
murder.
when
the
crime
was
broken
down
into
degrees,
it
was
held
that
a
murder,
a
killing
committed
during
the
commission
of
the
felony
would
be
first
degree
murder
because
the
intent
to
commit
the
felony
supplied
the
necessary
malice
and
premeditation
for
the
first
degree
of
murder
offense.
it
is
--
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
district
of
columbia
has
held
that
under
a
--
an
indictment
in
the
common
law
form
which
alleges
a
killing
with
malice
and
premeditation,
it
is
possible
to
prove
a
killing
during
the
perpetration
of
a
felony.
the
only
purpose
of
the
allegation
of
--
of
felony
is
to
supply
the
mental
intent
but
it
has
never
been
thought
that
--
that
the
mental
intent
in
and
of
itself
was
a
--
a
separately
--
was
a
separate
offense,
was
a
necessarily
included
crime.
mr.
sand
that
is
correct
and
in
--
mr.
sand
it
was
necessary
for
the
government
in
proving
in
crime
of
first
degree
murder
to
prove
that
the
defendant
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
sand
because
the
federal
law
is
clear
as
--
as
a
result
of
--
of
numerous
decisions
by
this
court.
that
in
determining
questions
of
double
jeopardy,
one
does
not
look
to
the
particular
facts
of
the
case
but
rather
looks
to
the
elements
of
the
crime.
and
where
the
elements
of
the
crime
are
different
or
be
it
in
--
in
the
particular
case,
they
result
from
one
act
of
the
defendant.
it
is
not
a
violation
of
double
jeopardy
to
--
to
convict
the
defendant
for
those
two
separate
appeals.
mr.
sand
if
he
had
been
acquitted
of
the
arson
count,
then
--
then
under
the
(inaudible)
case,
it
would
be
res
judicata
that
he
was
not
guilty
of
arson
and
so
an
acquittal
on
the
arson
count
would
have
precluded
a
trial
for
murder
under
the
--
mr.
sand
well,
the
--
the
(inaudible)
case
does
not
turn
on
double
jeopardy
terms,
perhaps
for
that
very
reason
but
--
but
turns
on
--
on
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata.
in
those
jurisdictions
such
as
--
mr.
sand
it
--
it
is
--
it
is
not
and
in
those
jurisdictions
such
as
new
jersey
which
followed
the
single
transaction
rule
at
state
v.cooper
relied
upon
by
petitioner
is
such
a
case
where
a
prior
conviction
--
mr.
sand
but
--
but
that
the
facts
there
were
close
to
this.
it
--
it
would
follow
that
if
both
crimes
result
from
the
same
act
of
the
defendant,
then
double
jeopardy
would
preclude
--
mr.
sand
well
--
mr.
sand
well,
it
would
--
it
would
make
--
would
make
no
difference.
and
if
there
had
been
an
acquittal
of
--
of
the
lesser
included
offense,
there
could
not
be
a
retrial
for
the
--
mr.
sand
--
by
a
greater
sense.
mr.
sand
well,
it
--
it's
--
mr.
sand
in
--
in
our
--
in
either
event,
it
is
--
mr.
sand
well,
if
res
judicata
terms,
the
--
the
defendant
--
it
has
been
found
that
the
defendant
committed
the
arson.
mr.
sand
yes.
but
--
and
if
the
law
in
the
federal
courts
were
that
where
there
is
an
element
in
common
in
two
offenses
or
where
in
fact
both
crimes
are
committed
by
the
defendant,
by
performing
one
act,
then
the
position
of
the
government
in
this
case
could
not
be
sustained.
but
in
--
in
a
holstered
cases
some
of
which
is
cited
on
--
on
page
48
of
the
government's
brief.
that
that
rule
has
been
explicitly
rejected
and
it
has
been
held
that
where
the
elements
of
the
offense
are
different
regardless
of
whether
they
were
the
same
in
a
particular
case.
if
trial
and
conviction
for
both
offenses
is
not
there
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
sand
well,
the
--
the
gist
of
the
crime
of
--
of
a
murder
in
the
first
degree
of
--
of
homicide
is
the
killing.
the
only
lesser
included
offenses
are
other
degrees
of
killing.
in
fact
for
the
felony
murder
doctrine
to
apply,
the
felony
must
be
a
--
a
felony
unrelated
to
the
killing.
if
--
if
the
felony
is
an
integral
part
of
the
killing
then
the
felony
murder
doctrine
is
--
is
inapplicable.
arson
is
a
crime
against
property.
murder
is
--
is
a
crime
against
the
person.
one
does
not
look
under
the
federal
rule
to
what
transpired
in
this
particular
case.
one
looks
to
the
offenses,
and
if
the
elements
of
the
offense
are
--
the
elements
of
the
offenses
are
different
then
conviction
for
both
crime
is
permissible.
mr.
sand
that
this
court
--
mr.
sand
this
court
has
so
held
on
--
on
many
occasions.
and
specifically,
with
respect
to
whether
a
jury
could
return
a
verdict
of
guilty
of
arson
for
the
--
under
the
second
count
of
the
indictment
in
wheeler
against
the
united
states.
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
district
of
columbia
said
that
"where
the
felony
murder
was
--
one
of
robbery
that
the
jury
could
not
under
the
--
under
the
murder
indictment
return
a
verdict
of
guilty
of
--
mr.
sand
this
is
--
this
--
mr.
sand
that
it
--
yes.
mr.
sand
the
(inaudible)
case,
the
--
the
facts
was
very
close
to
that.
mr.
sand
no.i
mean
under
the
law
as
--
as
stated
by
--
by
this
court.
mr.
sand
and
--
mr.
sand
yes,
your
honor.
the
cases
are
cited
on
page
48
of
the
reference
--
mr.
sand
i
would
like
to
turn
now
to
the
mcnabb
point
and
call
to
the
court's
attention
one
very
significant
fact
which
has
not
previously
been
called
to
the
court's
attention.
and
that
is
that
the
defendant
testified
in
this
case
and
on
the
witness
stand,
acknowledged
the
truth
of
almost
all
of
the
statements
concerning
which
there
was
testimony
with
respect
to
extra
judicial
admissions.
petitioner
has
relied
on
--
on
two
specific
examples
as
being
very
prejudicial
to
the
--
to
his
case,
one
was
the
denial
of
the
--
by
petitioner
that
he
had
written
a
very
incriminating
letter.
the
petitioner
testified
at
the
trial
that
he
had
made
that
denial.
the
other
was
--
was
with
respect
to
whether
the
petitioner
had
previously
told
the
investigators
that
the
deceased
was
discovered
by
him
to
have
died
a
natural
death
before
the
fire
occurred.
this
testimony
too
was
repeated
by
the
defendant
--
at
--
at
the
trial.
he
acknowledged
that
--
that
this
was
true.
that
portion
of
the
defendant's
testimony
is
not
reprinted
in
the
printed
transcript
but
it
appears
at
pages
547
and
548
of
the
transcript
of
the
entire
trial
which
--
which
is
on
file
before
the
court.
with
respect
to
the
--
the
mcnabb
point,
it's
--
the
objection
at
the
trial
court
was
not
that
the
questioning
occurred
too
late
after
two
longer
detentions
but
rather
that
it
occurred
too
soon.
on
many
occasions
during
the
voir
dire
and
throughout
the
trial,
counsel
for
the
petitioner
waived
any
objection
to
testimony
with
respect
to
the
28th
of
may
which
was
the
third
day
of
--
of
his
hospitalization.
and
indeed,
all
of
that
--
all
of
the
substantial
allegations
on
the
28th
were
repeated
by
the
defendant
at
the
trial
and
acknowledged
by
him.
and
so,
the
objection
focused
on
the
extra
judicial
statements
made
by
the
petitioner
immediately
after
the
fire.
in
this
connection,
it
is
important
to
know
that
at
the
time
of
the
first
questioning
at
8:30
on
may
26,
the
petitioner
was
not
under
arrest.
the
earliest
stage
at
which
it
may
be
said
that
he
was
under
police
custody
was
subsequent
to
that
because
it
was
at
the
conclusion
of
that
questioning
that
the
call
was
made
by
the
policeman
to
the
precinct
asking
that
--
that
a
policeman
be
--
be
sent
to,
i
think,
look
after
this
gentleman,
was
the
language
in
the
record.
and
in
fact,
that
policeman
had
not
arrived
until
after
the
--
the
second
questioning.
so,
one
does
not
have
illegal
detention
nor
any
type
of
detention
at
the
time
of
the
first
questioning.
and
--
and
all
subsequent
times,
petitioners
testimony
was
consistent
with
the
statements
which
he
made
during
that
first
question.
in
--
indeed
he
--
that
was
his
story
even
at
the
trial.
it
was
a
story
to
the
effect
that
somehow,
an
unidentified
man
got
into
this
house
which
was
locked
and
barred.
this
occurred
by
coincidence
on
the
day
following
which
he
was
served
with
a
notice
that
he
would
be
evicted
from
that
--
that
house.
and
that
this
unidentified
person
stabbed
him,
set
the
fire
--
fires,
opened
the
gas
pipe,
stabbed
him
and
--
and
left,
a
story
which
wasn't
credible.
mr.
sand
there,
petitioner
has
conceded
that
--
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
was
physically
able
to
be
arraigned
at
any
prior
occasion
that
if
prior
to
the
occasion
when
he
was
arraigned.he
was
released
on
the
28th
because
he
was
at
that
time
well
enough
to
be
released.
mr.
sand
the
--
the
testimony
with
respect
to
the
--
to
the
questioning
on
the
26th
at
3
p.m.
is
that
the
inspector
asked
the
nurse
whether
it
would
be
all
right
to
talk
to
petitioner
and
was
told
that
it
would
be.
also
that
he
asked
--
mr.
sand
to
question
him.
mr.
sand
to
question
him
about
--
about
--
mr.
sand
i
don't
recall
whether
the
exact
--
mr.
sand
the
--
the
--
mr.
sand
i
--
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
is
not
any
difference
whereas
here,
the
questioner
at
the
outset
identified
himself
as
being
a
--
a
government
official
interested
in
the
investigation
of
--
of
the
cause
of
the
fire.
in
--
in
that
context,
i
submit
that
there
is
not
that
--
that
significant
difference.
this
court
--
mr.
sand
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
sand
well,
i
--
i
think
that
--
that
it
applies
here
because
you
have
--
regardless
of
the
validity
of
--
of
previous
statements
made
by
the
extra
judicial
statements.
you
have
here
an
acknowledgement
by
the
defendant
on
the
witness
stand
that
--
that
these
facts
did
take
place,
that
he
did
say
what
--
what
he
had
said
on
--
on
the
previous
occasion.
there
--
there
is
no
confession
here.
the
--
the
statements
were
--
mr.
sand
yes.
but
--
as
--
as
here,
the
--
the
reason
for
the
introduction
of
--
of
these
exculpatory
statements
because
of
the
--
the
incriminating
nature
of
--
of
some
of
the
admissions
that
are
--
that
are
contained
--
mr.
sand
yes.
mr.
sand
yes,
sir.
but
--
here,
the
defendant
stated
at
the
trial
that
what
he
had
told
the
investigators
was
true
and
he
--
and
he
reiterated
that
testimony
in
--
in
all
the
--
the
substantial
respects
at
the
trial.
mr.
sand
that
was
after
the
evidence
was
--
was
offered
against
him.
mr.
sand
it
--
mr.
sand
there
are
--
there
are
two
significant
factors,
i
--
i
think
here
and
--
and
perhaps
in
some
respects,
this
case
is
--
is
closer
to
the
--
to
the
mitchell
case
than
to
any
other.
because
here,
you
have
immediately,
after
the
--
the
offense,
at
a
time
when
there
is
no
custody
at
all.
you
have
a
statement
given
by
the
defendant.
the
only
possible
objection
that
can
be
made
to
that
is
that
it
was
so
soon
after
the
occurrence
of
the
--
of
the
fire
that
it
was
unreliable.
this
was
a
fact
question
which
was
submitted
to
the
jury
and
there
were
no
objection
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
sand
at
the
occasion
of
the
--
of
the
--
the
first
question,
he
had
been
taken
to
a
private
hospital
because
he
was
in
need
of
--
of
hospitalization.
mr.
sand
of
--
of
the
record?
mr.
sand
this
has
--
mr.
sand
this
has
reference,
mr.
justice
brennan,
to
the
third
question
--
questioning
on
that
day
after
he
had
been
transferred
from
the
pride
of
hospital,
which
is
emergency
hospital
to
the
strong
room
of
the
d.c.
general
hospital.
at
the
time
of
that
questioning,
there
is
no
doubt
he
was
in
police
custody.
but,
of
course,
there
is
nothing
in
the
evidence
to
suggest
this
petitioner
has,
that
he
would
not
--
that
a
--
an
attorney
would
not
have
been
permitted
to
--
to
enter
the
--
mr.
sand
he
was
not,
your
honor.
mr.
sand
he
had
been
--
at
the
conclusion
of
the
first
questioning
--
mr.
sand
no
--
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
sand
he
was
taken
by
the
rescue
squad
which
answered
the
fire.
there
was
at
that
time
no
knowledge
that
--
that
the
fires
had
been
self-started.
they
--
they
entered
the
--
the
burning
building
after
breaking
down
the
locked
doors
and
windows
and
they
found
the
petitioner
there.
they
took
him
out
to
the
lawn,
they
administered
oxygen
and
took
him
immediately
to
the
hospital,
to
the
private
hospital.
a
--
the
first
investigator
arrived
at
the
scene,
had
no
knowledge
of
--
of
the
cause
of
the
fire
and
went
and
spoke
to
the
petitioner
because
he
was
told
that
he
was
the
only
one
who
had
any
knowledge
as
to
the
fire.
he
was
the
only
who
was
in
the
building.
this
is
the
first
--
this
is
the
first
questioning
on
8:30
of
--
of
may
26th.
there
--
there
was
no
questioning
on
the
27th
of
may.
and
so,
it
is
very
misleading
to
say
that
after
two
and
half
days
of
questioning
because
there
was
questioning
on
--
on
just
these
two
days.
mr.
sand
he
was
in
the
private
hospital
from
8:30
on
--
on
--
on
may
26
until
2:10
p.m.
mr.
sand
of
that
same
day.
at
2:10
p.m.
he
was
transferred
to
the
--
to
the
d.c.
general
hospital.
there
was
a
second
questioning
which
followed
an
hour
and
a
half
after
the
first
questioning.
in
--
and
again,
the
petitioner
told
the
same
basic
story
that
he
had
been
attacked
by
this
man
and
who
--
who
set
the
fire,
separate
fires
that
were
found
in
the
building
and
--
and
denied
that
--
that
--
denied
that
--
that
--
well
--
well,
his
--
his
story
was
limited
to
that.
it's
an
exculpatory
story
sought
to
play
(inaudible)
on
this
--
this
unidentified
person.
mr.
sand
the
--
the
government
doesn't
--
mr.
sand
--
does
--
does
not
rely
on
--
on
the
exculpatory
nature
of
the
--
of
the
statement.
it
relies
rather
on
the
fact
that
the
--
the
story
told
by
the
petitioner
was
first
told
at
a
time
when
he
was
not
in
any
formal
custody.
and
under
the
mitchell
case,
such
a
--
a
confession,
if
it
be
a
confession
is
admissible
because
a
subsequent
illegal
detention
does
not
render
the
first
confession.
mr.
sand
yes,
but
that
there
is
a
--
if
the
only
question
is
as
to
the
voluntary
nature
of
--
of
this
--
of
the
statements
made
by
the
--
by
the
petitioner
apart
from
many
question
that's
mentioned
then
the
--
the
record
is
--
is
clear
that
the
permission
of
the
petitioner
was
asked
with
respect
to
the
--
to
the
questioning
which
is
most
seriously
questioned,
the
3
p.m.
questioning.
the
--
the
investage
--
the
invest
--
the
investigator
asked
the
policeman
whether
it
would
be
all
right
with
the
petitioner
if
--
if
he
could
talk
to
him
and
the
petitioner
said
that
it
was
okay
to
--
to
use
the
term
--
mr.
sand
--
determine.
mr.
sand
that
--
that
is
mr.
blow's
case
at
--
at
this
level.
at
--
at
the
trial
level
--
mr.
sand
--
it
was
an
entirely
different
area
--
mr.
sand
--
contention,
yes.
mr.
sand
ab
initio.
mr.
sand
it
--
it
was
so
promptly,
your
honor,
that
it
was
before
arrest
and
before
there
was
even
suspicion.
who
was
immediately
after
the
fire,
the
petitioner
was
taken
to
this
hospital.
the
--
the
investigator
who
--
who
spoke
to
him
arrived
at
the
scene
of
the
fire,
was
told
that
a
person
had
been
taken
from
that
building
and
taken
to
the
hospital.
he
had
no
knowledge
that
the
fire
was
--
was
a
self-started
fire.
he
went
and
he
spoke
to
petitioner.
petitioner
said
that
he
had
been
attacked
by
this
unidentified
man
and
who
--
who
stabbed
him
and
who
started
the
fires.
mr.
sand
the
--
the
--
there
are
two
other
statements.
one
is
a
denial
that
he
wrote
a
letter
which
was
sent
to
the
--
the
night
before
in
which
was
--
was
highly
incriminated
and
he
denied
at
the
first
questioning
that
he
wrote
that
letter.
at
the
questioning
on
the
first
day,
he
denied
that
he
wrote
that
letter.
on
the
third
day,
there
being
no
question
on
the
second
day,
when
the
letter
--
when
the
letter
was
found
and
shown
to
him,
he
acknowledged
that
--
that
he
wrote
the
letter.
at
the
trial,
he
agreed
that
that
was
his
letter.
he
--
he
admitted
that
that
was
true
and
he
also
testified
at
the
trial
that
he
had
denied
to
the
investigators.
mr.
sand
on
his
--
this
was
on
cross
examination
of
the
defendant
at
the
trial.
he
did
--
he
admitted
that
he
had
previously
denied
to
the
investigators
that
he
had
written
the
letter.
and
--
and
so,
there
is
no
--
there
--
there
is
nothing
which
--
which
is
the
fruit
of
a
subsequent
illegal
detention
if
--
if
there
was
such
a
detention,
and
--
and
the
government
submits
that
there
was
not.
there
was
no
evidence
that
this
man
was
not
arraigned
at
the
earliest
time
when
it
was
physically
possible
to
arraign
him.
and
so,
that
it
--
under
--
under
the
mitchell
case,
the
--
the
testimony
was
not
prejudicial
to
the
--
to
the
defendant.
there
was
not
--
mr.
sand
the
government
did
not
try
to
arraign
him.
mr.
sand
well,
the
testimony
--
there
was
no
testimony
that
--
to
the
contrary.
and
the
testimony
is
that
he
was
released
at
the
--
on
the
morning
of
may
28
because
he
was
at
that
time
well
enough.
the
--
the
contention
of
the
--
of
the
petitioner
was
that
he
was
not
--
not
being
well
enough
then
to
--
to
go
with
this.
the
government
took
a
car
in
his
inquest.
there
is
not
here
under
any
reading
of
the
record,
a
detention
for
the
purposes
of
questioning.
the
detention
here,
if
--
if
it
may
properly
be
called
a
detention
was
because
the
petitioner
needed
--
needed
hospitalization.
if
the
purpose
of
the
mcnabb
rule
is
to
avoid
illegal
detention,
that
--
that
reasoning
does
not
apply
here
because
this
is
not
a
--
a
situation
created
by
enforcement
agents
for
the
purposes
of
--
of
its
active
confessions
from
the
--
from
the
petitioner.
mr.
sand
i
--
i
suppose
that
your
honor
has
reference
to
the
summation
of
the
--
of
the
trial?
mr.
sand
the
significant
point
to
be
made
there
is
that
the
comments
of
the
attorney,
the
government
attorney,
were
in
response
to
arguments
which
had
been
made,
which
had
been
advanced
to
the
jury
in
the
summation
of
the
defense.
mr.
sand
yes,
your
honor.
they
appear
at
--
at
page

mr.
sand
those
are
--
mr.
sand
the
--
mr.
sand
the
--
mr.
sand
page
62
of
the
government's
brief.
mr.
sand
on
page
62
of
the
--
of
the
--
the
government's
brief
it
act
--
it
begins
at
the
bottom
of
page
61.
defense
counsel
in
summation
said
that
the
finding
of
the
jury
of
fact
was
final
and
it
--
that
nobody
"can
hold
you
to
their
opinion
on
questions
of
facts."
which
of
course
is
--
is
inaccurate
statement.
but
then
he
went
on
to
say,
"is
he
guilty
of
first
degree
murder
as
charged,
and
then
he
goes
to
the
electric
chair
and
nothing
will
stop
it,
it
is
mandatory."
and
then
he
proceeded
and
said
putting
himself
in
the
position
of
the
hypothetical
(inaudible).
"before
i
can
send
him
to
the
electric
chair"
and
there's
this
repetition
at
several
points
in
the
summation
of
the
defense
counsel
which
created
the
impression
that
it
was
the
function
of
the
jury
to
impose
sentence
and
that
a
--
the
imposition
of
capital
punishment
was
inevitable,
not
merely
mandatory
but
inevitable.
mr.
sand
well
--
mr.
sand
well,
if
--
if
your
honor
please.
there
is
printed
in
the
transcript
--
mr.
sand
--
only
a
potion
of
the
summation
of
the
defense
counsel.
the
entire
summation
appears
in
the
full
transcript
of
the
record
which
is
on
file
in
the
court.
and
the
government
has
reprinted
it
at
page
62
of
the
brief.
the
portions
of
that
summation
which
the
government
submits
provoked
the
comment
of
the
--
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
and
--
and
which
must
be
read
in
context
with
the
summation
of
defense
counsel.
mr.
sand
the
--
the
prosecutor
then
--
well,
at
--
in
the
first
instance,
he
objected
during
the
summation
of
the
defense
counsel
to
the
impression
which
was
being
created
that
it
was
the
jury
which
imposed
sentence.
and
as
we
have
noted
previously,
this
was
not
the
type
of
statute
where
the
jury
was
called
upon
to
make
any
recommendation
with
respect
to
sentence.
the
--
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
called
the
jury's
attention
to
the
fact
that
their
--
reading
from
the
--
towards
the
bottom
of
page
63
of
the
government's
brief
that
their
--
your
duty
as
representatives
and
members
of
this
community
is
to
sit
here,
listen
to
the
facts,
take
the
law
that
is
honorable
give
you
which
governs
this
case.
and
then
in
accordance
with
the
facts
and
with
the
law,
to
reach
a
fair
and
impartial
verdict
based
on
the
evidence
and
law
and
on
nothing
else.
issue
was
taken
by
the
petitioner,
where
this
--
mr.
sand
where
that
statement
to
have
been
made
by
the
district
attorney
in
the
abstract,
it
--
it
would
be
an
improper
statement.
mr.
sand
the
language
that
we
rely
on
is
the
language
by
which
the
defense
counsel
sought
to
create
--
in
--
in
which
he
sought
to
create
the
impression
that
the
sentencing
function
was
the
jury's
function.
mr.
sand
that
the
jury
sent
the
petitioner
to
the
electric
chair.
mr.
sand
they
are
--
the
--
they
are
to
be
found
at
--
in
printed
form
in
the
government's
brief
at
page
62.
mr.
sand
well,
he
said
for
example
at
page
602
--
mr.
sand
well,
beginning
then
at
--
at
the
bottom
of
page
61.
mr.
sand
said,
"no
one
can
hold
you
to
their
opinion
of
questions
of
fact
for
you
are
the
sole
judges
of
facts."
mr.
sand
then
--
mr.
sand
your
--
your
honor,
the
government's
position
is
that
all
this
language
must
be
read
in
the
context
of
the
entire
summation
and
that
the
highlights
of
which
has
--
are
set
forth
here.
mr.
sand
if
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice
--
but
what
follows
and
which
is
predicated
on
that,
is
not.
mr.
sand
he
--
he
said
further,
"each
of
you
will
know"
--
mr.
sand
yes.
mr.
sand
can
challenge
--
mr.
sand
well,
there
--
there
are
postures
of
the
case
of
course,
where
an
appellate
court
would
say
that
--
that
the
--
that
the
jury
could
not
have
reached
that
verdict,
that
--
that
there
was
an
insufficiency
of
the
evidence.
but
the
--
the
impression
of
inevitability
which
this
language
created
was
followed
--
mr.
sand
--
by
his
statement.
"each
of
you
will
vote
on
that
direct
issue."
mr.
sand
guilt
or
innocent.
mr.
sand
"is
he
guilty
of
first
degree
murder
as
charged?
and
then
he
goes
to
the
electric
chair
and
nothing
will
stop
it.
it
is
mandatory."
mr.
sand
there
is
a
mandatory
death
penalty
for
a
violation
of
this
statute
--
mr.
sand
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
sand
not
--
not
at
this
point,
your
honor.
mr.
sand
that
the
--
the
portion
which
the
government
principally
relies
are
the
following
passages.
where
he
said,
"if
after
my
discussion
of
that
and
come
to
the
factual
opinion
that
this
man
should
not
go
to
the
electric
chair."
mr.
sand
he
said,
"before
i,"
and
i
here
refers
to
--
to
the
jury
before
a
juror.
mr.
sand
"before
i
can
send
him
to
the
electric
chair."
mr.
sand
"i
have
to
say
to
myself,
i
have
no
reasonable
doubt
about
what
caused
the
death
of
this
lovely
lady."
mr.
sand
the
jury
does
not
send
the
defendant
to
the
electric
chair.
the
--
the
imposition
of
sentence
is
a
consequence
of
the
jury's
determination
of
the
facts
under
the
law
submitted
to
them
by
--
by
the
court.
imposition
of
sentence
is
not
jury
function
particularly
under
the
statute
such
as
this
one
where
there
is
no
jury
discretion
with
respect
to
--
to
the
sentence.
then
he
continued
further,
"even
though
you
are
morally
certain
that
he
set
all
the
fires,
you
still
under
your
law
must
not
--
must
say
not
guilty
and
not
send
him
to
that
chair.
yes,
under
your
solemn
and
sacred
oath
shall
i,
as
a
juror,
send
that
kind
of
human
being
to
the
electric
chair."
mr.
sand
well,
the
--
the
full
--
the
full
transcript
is
--
is
now
before
me,
your
honor.
i
--
mr.
sand
the
passage
begins
at
--
at
page
600.
if
the
--
the
court
desire
that
that
i
read
the
full
--
mr.
sand
--
passage
--
mr.
sand
well
--
mr.
sand
i
--
i
agree,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
if
this
argument
had
been
one
initially
advanced
by
the
government,
it
would
be
highly
improper.
there
are
cited
at
--
at
page
65
of
the
government's
brief
several
cases
in
which
the
courts
have
said
that
an
argument
made
in
rebuttal
which
standing
alone
would
be
improper,
is
not
improper.
mr.
sand
where
it
is
made
in
rebuttal
and
whereas
here,
there
is
no
objection
taken.
mr.
sand
in
his
charge
to
the
jury,
he
informed
the
jury
that
--
that
the
--
there
was
a
death
sentence.
and
of
course,
at
the
voir
dire
of
the
jury
was
informed
if
--
if
there
was
a
death
sentence.
mr.
sand
i
cannot
so
concede,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
one
must
read
the
entire
record
and
the
--
the
entire
charge,
and
to
turn
them
then,
whether
in
view
of
all
of
the
evidence,
this
was
such
a
prejudicial
error
that
--
that
a
reversal
is
--
is
warranted.
and
after
reading
this
--
this
record
i
cannot
--
cannot
so
state
to
the
court.
mr.
sand
there
was
no
objection
taken.
mr.
sand
there
was
--
there
was
no
such
request.
there
is
as
this
court
noted
in
--
in
the
(inaudible)
case.
it
--
it
is
possible
to
--
to
abstract
from
the
cold
record
an
incident
which
actually
in
--
at
the
time
of
trial
played
a
very
small
role
in
--
in
the
jury's
determination.
i
--
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
reason
why
no
objection
was
taken
is
because
in
the
context
that
--
of
this
case,
there
was
no
substantial
prejudice
to
the
defendant
by
the
remarks
of
the
prosecution.
the
--
the
summation
of
the
defense
counsel
created
in
the
jury's
mind
the
erroneous
impression
that
the
sentencing
function
was
their
function,
that
they,
the
defendants,
came
back
and
--
and
sent
the
petitioner
to
the
electric
chair.
mr.
sand
well
--
mr.
sand
well,
it
is
--
it
is
this
language
that
--
that
i
send
him
to
the
electric
chair.
i
the
juror,
send
him
to
the
electric
chair,
which
--
which
means
i
imposed
the
death
sentence
on
this
defendant.
it
--
it
is
--
it
is
congress
which
has
decreed
that
one
found
guilty
of
this
crime
should
be
subject
to
the
mandatory.
mr.
sand
yes,
that
they
--
they
--
the
transcript
references
appear
in
the
--
in
the
government's
brief
and
--
and
there,

mr.

i
would
think
that

would
really
have
to

the

i
know
that

mr.

i
could
if
--
if
the
court
will
give
me
access
to
the
--
to
the
only
record
which
exists,
which
the
--
which
the
government

the
government
has
no
record
of
the
transcript.
there
is
a
copy
which
is
the
copy
now

me

mr.

of
the

mr.
sand
and

and
if
i
may
take

i
will
transfer

--
as

thank
you.
mr.
sand
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
no
federal
court
has
ever
accepted
the
limited
waiver
doctrine
which
petitioner
now
urges.
on
the
contrary
that
doctrine
has
been
specifically
rejected
by
the
federal
courts
as
early
as
1846
in
united
states
against
harding,
a
decision
by
mr.
justice
grier
then
sitting
in
the
circuit
court
and
which
he
indicated
that
upon
retrial
after
conviction
for
the
lesser
included
offence,
a
defendant
could
be
retried
for
the
greater
offence.
with
respect
to
the
early
history
of
the
fifth
amendment,
i
have
cited
in
the
government's
supplemental
briefs,
when
first
proposed
the
fifth
amendment
read,
“no
person
shall
be
subject
to
more
than
one
punishment
or
one
trial
for
the
same
offence.”
objection
was
made
to
that
in
the
debates
in
congress
on
the
grounds
that,
that
would
preclude
a
defendant
from
securing
a
reversal
of
his
conviction
and
a
retrial,
and
of
course
we
know
that
subsequently
when
the
fifth
amendment
was
enacted
that
provision
was
omitted.
the
early
history
of
the
double
jeopardy
provisions
in
the
united
states
are
summarized
in
an
article
in
eleven
(inaudible)
law
review
by
judge
bigelow,
the
reference
is
contained
in
the
government's
supplemental
brief.
it
is
of
course
clear
that
a
defendant
may
after
a
second
trial
receive
a
sentence
greater
than
that
initially
imposed
at
his
first
trial.
thus
every
defendant
who
receives
less
than
the
maximum
sentence
at
his
first
trial
runs
the
risk
of
ultimately
receiving
a
greater
sentenced
if
he
succeeds
in
having
his
first
conviction
reversed.
i
check
that
because
i
believe
in
essence
that
is
all
that
is
involved
in
this
aspect
of
this
case.
the
government
submits
that
this
case
is
controlled
by
trono,
but
it
is
for
many
reasons
an
a
fortiori
case,
after
trono
and
i
suggest
now
that
the
case
is
very
analogous
to
stroud
against
united
states
in
251
us.
there
the
defendant
was
tried
three
times
for
murder
in
the
first
degree.
the
first
time
he
was
found
guilty
and
the
death
sentence
was
imposed.
this
conviction
was
reversed.
upon
his
second
trial
the
jury
finding
him
guilty
recommended
that
capital
punishment
be
dispensed
with,
which
was
permissible
under
that
statute,
and
the
defendant
received
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment.
this
conviction
was
reversed
and
upon
the
third
trial
he
was
found
guilty
of
murder
in
the
first
degree,
the
jury
making
no
recommendation
dispensing
the
capital
punishment.
he
was
there
upon
sentenced
to
death.
this
court
found
that
there
was
no
violation
of
fifth
amendment
in
the
subsequent
imposition
of
the
death
sentence
and
wrote
that
the
only
thing
that
the
appellate
court
could
do
when
he
secured
the
reversal
was
to
remand
the
case
for
a
new
trial
and
that
in
such
cases
the
defendant
was
not
placed
in
second
jeopardy,
within
the
meaning
of
the
constitution,
the
court
citing
trono.
i
would
like
to
state
if
i
may
the
reasons
why
the
government
feels
that
this
case
follows
a
fortiori
from
the
trono
decision.
first
the
basis
for
the
reversal
of
the
conviction
of
second
degree
murder
was
petitioners'
assertion
that
if
he
were
guilty
of
any
crime
it
was
murder
in
the
first
degree.
because
this
was
petitioners
theory
accepted
by
the
court
of
appeals
it
was
apparent
that
the
only
crime
for
which
he
could
be
retried
was
the
crime
of
first
degree
murder.
under
these,
under
these
facts
in
the
theory
of
the
reversal
there
could
be
trial
for
no
other
crime.
indeed
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
remanded
the
case
for
retrial.
and
while
petitioner
had
on
the
first
appeal
asked
the
court
of
appeals
for
a
reversal
of
his
conviction,
he
had
not
asked
for
a
dismissal
of
the
indictment
or
a
judgment
of
acquittal
or
any
other
relief.
the
remand
to
the
district
court
for
retrial
offers
to
be
made
what
was
the
natural
consequence
of
the
theory
which
petitioner
had
urged
upon
the
court
of
appeals.
first
it
was
impossible
to
retry
the
defendant
for
any
crime
other
than
first
degree
murder.
if
as
trono
holds
even
where
it
is
possible
to
retry
a
defendant
for
a
lesser
included
offense,
it
is
permissible
to
retry
him
for
the
greater
offense.
surely
here
when
retrial
could
only
be
for
first
degree
murder
such
retrial
is
possible.
were
this
is
not
so,
the
consequence
of
the
error
committed
by
the
trial
judge
at
the
first
trial
would
be
to
confer
upon
the
defendant
an
absolute
immunity
from
retrial
for
the
crime
of
murder.
this
court
wrote
in
the
(inaudible)
case
that
the
constitution
does
not
require
that
sentencing
should
be
again
and
which
a
wrong
move
by
the
judge
means
immunity
for
the
prisoner
and
that
case
and
that
language
of
the
court
we
think
applies
here.
mr.
sand
but
we
feel
that
the
government
--
it
is
not
only
an
undesirable
result
but
is
a
result
which
in
no
way
compelled
by
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
sand
not
by
reason
by
policy
they
got
in
here.
the
american
law
institute
after
studying
the
conflicting
state
decisions,
some
of
which
are
relied
upon
so
heavily
by
petitioner
recommended
that
the
law
of
the
federal
courts
be
adopted
and
that
a
finding
of
guilty
of
a
lesser
included
offense
which
is
subsequently
set
aside
is
not
the
acquittal
of
the
great
offence.
the
american
law
institute
comment,
it's
very
pertinent
to
this
case.
it
is
that
when
he,
the
defendant,
procures
the
reversal
on
the
ground
that
his
conduct
or
what
constitutes
the
great
offense
does
not
constitute
the
lesser
offense,
subsequent
prosecution
for
the
great
offense
is
certainly
warranted,
that's
precisely
the
government's
position.
mr.
sand
under
the
trono
case
the
result
would
be
the
same.
i
--
mr.
sand
well
i
would,
i
would
--
following
the
language
and
reasoning
of
the
supreme
court
in
the
trono
case,
i
would
be
arguing
that
such
a
retrial
was
possible,
but
i
emphasis
the
fact
that
that
is
clearly
not
in
this
case
and
i
think
that
the,
the
other
two
reasons
to
which
i
would
like
now
to
direct
myself
why
that
does
not
in
this
case
are
significant.
i
believe
that
for
the
court
to
hold
that
this
case
--
that
retrial
here
violates
double
jeopardy
the
court
would
have
to
overrule
the
trono
case,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
to
affirm
here
the
court
would
have
to
accept
the
full
ramifications
of
the
trono
case
because
of
the
facts
peculiar
to
this
case
that
to
which
i
am
now
directing.
mr.
sand
yes.
mr.
sand
my
answer
to
that
is
that
i
think
mr.
justice
frankfurter
you
have
stated
in
your
--
in
your
question
to
me
the
facts
in
trono
in
that
i
in
trono
there
was
agreed
a
specific
finding
of
acquittal
of
the
great
offense.
and
throughout
the
majority
and
the
minority
opinion
there
is
reference
to
the
fact
that
there
was
an
acquittal.
and
so
if
one
were
to
accept
the
full
ramifications
of
the
trono
decision,
one
would
have
to
say
that
new
trial
for
murder
would
be
permitted.
but
this,
the
second
factor
which
is
peculiar
to
this
case
is
that
here
the
nature
of
the
error
was
such
that
a
prejudice
both,
both
the
government
and
the
defendant,
one
can
only
speculate
and
it's
ideal
speculation
whether
had
the
jury
at
the
first
trial
been
properly
instructed
that
they
must
find
first
degree
murder
or
acquit,
they
would
have
acquitted,
or
would
have
done
what
the
jury
did
at
the
second
trial
on
substantially
on
some
same
evidence,
but
properly
instructed,
find
the
defendant
guilty
of
first
degree,
and
a
third
factor
which
is
peculiar
to
this
case
is
that
looking
at
the
verdict
returned
by
the
jury
at
the
first
case,
at
the
first
trial,
one
cannot
fairly
say
that,
that
jury
acquitted
the
defendant
of
the
crime
(inaudible)
mr.
sand
i
think
not.
as
the
trono
case
holds
--
mr.
sand
but
the
reason
it
convicts
of
one
and
not
the
other
is
because
there
is
an
error
in
that
proceeding,
the
very
--
mr.
sand
we
get
this
somewhat
paradoxical
situation.
the
petitioner
is
urging
that
because
it
was
error
to
instruct
the
first
jury
that
they
might
find
the
defendant
guilty
of
second
degree
murder,
then
at
a
second
trial
the
jury
must
be
instructed
that
the
only
crime
for
which
they
can
find
the
defendant
guilty
is
second
degree
murder.
mr.
sand
well,
i
think
what
is
wrong
with
it
mr.
justice
black
is
that
the
supreme
court
in
trono
has
held
that,
that
is
not
a
violation
of
double
jeopardy.
mr.
sand
trono
says
that.
mr.
sand
no
i'm
not.
where
the
jury
--
mr.
sand
i
come
back
to
saying
that
in
the
view
taken
by
this
court
in
trono,
if
we
are
dealing
with
lesser
included
offenses,
and
there
is
a
reversal
--
not
only
a
reversal
of
the
conviction
for
the
lesser
included
offenses,
but
as
a
first
proceeding
there
is
a
specific
finding
acquittal
which
were
the
facts
in
trono,
but
there
is
no
difference,
that
the
second
trial
is
permissible.
mr.
sand
arson
the
government
submits
is
in
no
way
a
lesser
included
offense,
but
second
degree
murder
is
a
lesser
included
offense
as
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
has
held
where
the
facts
permit
it
to
be
such,
in
the
felony
and
murder
case
--
mr.
sand
no.
we
state
that
the
reversal
of
--
mr.
sand
i
don't
mean
to
be
(inaudible)
mr.
sand
i
think
that
where
there
has
been
a
conviction
for
a
lesser
included
offence,
that
the
--
and
the
conviction
is
reversed,
that
the
government
may
then
retry
the
defendant
for
the
greater
offence.
i
think
that
this
follows
regardless
of
whether
informed,
the
jury
says
we
acquit
the
defendant
of
first
degree
murder,
but
find
him
guilty
of
second
degree
murder
or
whether
the
jury
says
merely
we
find
the
defendant
guilty
of
second
degree
murder.
mr.
sand
under
the
laws
that
has
been
found
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
interpreting
a
district
of
columbia
statue,
where
the
facts
are
such
that
there
may
have
been
committed
another
form
of
murder
other
than
the
felony
murder,
then
second
degree
murder
would
be
a
lesser
included
offense,
for
example,
where
and
i'm
stating
the
facts
in
the
goodall
case,
in
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
sand
no
your
honor,
it
would
have
been
--
it
was
error
to
charge
the
jury
that
they
could
find
second
degree
murder
and
the
jury
could
not
have
found.
mr.
sand
no,
i
welcome
the
court
--
mr.
sand
in
terms
of
reality
and
not
in
legal
consequences,
of
course
we
know
that
the
reason
that
the
jury
is
of
course
different
and
the
jury
did
not
in
fact
--
mr.
sand
now
from
the
verdict
of
this
jury,
what
in
fact
they
found,
they
found
that
the
defendant
was
guilty
of
arson,
they
found
that
the
victim
died
as
a
result
of
the
actions
by
the
defendant,
and
so
in
essence
we
know
that
in
fact
that
first
jury
found
that
the
defendant
was
guilty
of
all
the
elements
of
felony
murder
and
so
in
those
sense,
in
fact
all
legal
consequences
did
that
first
jury
acquit
the
defendant
of
murder.
the
government
provides
not
only
on
the
trono
case
which
is
--
and
it
is
not
the
only
holding
by
the
court
on
this
point,
but
also
on
brantley
against
the
state
of
georgia
in
217
us,
which
came
under
writ
of
error
from
the
state
court,
there
the
defendant
was
convicted
of
voluntary
manslaughter
and
obtained
a
reversal
of
that
conviction.
on
retrial
he
claimed
that
he
could
not
be
tried
for
the
greater
of
offence,
for
murder,
either
under
the
fifth
amendment
or
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
question
not
having
then
been
resolved
by
this
court,
whether
the
fifth
amendment
and
its
prohibition
against
double
jeopardy
applied
to
the
states
whether
directly
or
whether
it
was
an
aspect
of
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
supreme
court
in
a
unanimous
per
curiam
decision
stated
that
the
contention
that
retrial
for
the
greater
offense
was
a
violation
of
double
jeopardy,
it
is
absolutely
without
matter,
it
was
not
a
case
of
questioning
jeopardy
under
any
view
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
the
reasoning
supports
the
trono
decisions.
as
i've
said,
the
consequence
of
a
contrary
view
is
that
the
error
which
is
committed
at
the
first
trial,
is
not
eradicated
by
a
reversal
of
a
conviction
that
is
perpetuated.
moreover,
what
occurs
is
this.
there
is
no
valid
finding
that
the
act
ever
occurred,
that
the
defendant
ever
caused
the
death
of
the
victim,
but
there
is
a
finding
that
if
he
did
cause
the
death
of
the
victim,
it
was
not
by
premeditation
or
under
such
other
circumstances
as
with
need
to
the
greater
offense,
the
aggravated
offense,
if
the
contrary
rule
binds
the
hands
of
the
second
jury
regardless
of
the
evidence
presented
at
the
second
trial.
i
would
now
like
to
direct
myself
to
the
prior
un-appealed
conviction
for
arson
and
say
briefly
that
arson
is
in
no
sense
a
lesser
included
offense
of
a
crime
of
murder.
the
jury
could
not
have
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty
of
arson
on
the
murder
count
of
the
indictment.
arson
of
course
is
a
crime
against
property
that
the
gist
of
the
felony
murder
--
of
the
murder
count
is
a
homicide.
such
cases
as
states
against
cooper
which
hold
that
out
of
one
transaction
there
can
be
only
be
one
crime.
that
of
course
has
been
rejected
by
this
court.
nor
does
res
judicata
as
applied
to
the
prior
un-appealed
conviction,
a
petitioner,
for
that
judgment
--
where
the
only
judgment
reflected
in
the
arson
conviction
is
a
finding
by
the
jury
that
the
defendant
did
set
the
fire.
this
is
unlike
those
cases
where
there
is
a
prior
acquittal
with
respect
to
a
base
of
underlying
facts
such
as
the
(inaudible)
where
it
has
been
said
that
the
government
is
precluded
from
seeking
to
reestablish
a
fact
which
a
prior
jury
has
found
could
not
exist.
with
respect
to
the
argument
that
the
court
of
appeals
lacked
the
jurisdiction
to
remand
for
a
retrial
under
section
2106,
the
court
of
appeals
is
specifically
empowered
to
remand
a
case
for
such
further
proceedings
as
maybe
just
under
the
circumstances.
since
the
only
theory
of
the
reversal
was
that
this
crime
could
be
first
degree
murder
and
no
other
crime,
obviously
the
only
course
open
to
the
court
of
appeals
was
to
remand
for
retrial
for
the
greater
offense.
collateral
estoppel
of
course
was
not
applied
to
a
prior
reversed
verdict
in
the
same
proceeding
and
moreover
there
is
no
basic
evidentiary
fact
found
by
the
jury
in
the
first
case,
at
the
first
trial
which
in
anyway
exculpates
the
defendant.
i
would
like
turn
now
to
alleged
errors
at
the
trial
itself,
and
with
respect
to
petitioner's
contention
that
prejudicial
error
resulted
from
the
admission
into
evidence
of
a
prearranged
basis,
and
in
this
respect
i
think
it
maybe
helpful
to
briefly
sketch
in
chronological
sequence,
the
events
which
led
to
the
taking
of
those
statements.
on
the
morning
of
may
26,
1953,
at
7:40
that
morning,
firemen
arrived
at
the
scene
and
broke
into
this
house
on
massachusetts
avenue,
the
doors
and
windows
of
which
were
locked.
they
found
on
entering
that
the
victim
had
perished,
and
that
the
petitioner
was
suffering
from
superficial
stab
wounds
and
from
exposure
to
smoke.
he
was
immediately
taken
to
emergency
hospital.
at
about
8:45
that
same
morning,
sergeant
kocher
after
he
introduced
himself
as
a
member
of
the
homicide
squad,
questioned
petitioner
for
about
15
minutes
in
examining
room
of
the
emergency
hospital
while
doctors
and
nurses
were
coming
and
going.
petitioner
at
this
time
was
neither
under
arrest
nor
in
police
custody.
in
fact
sergeant
kocher
did
not
even
know
at
that
time
that
the
fire
was
the
result
of
arson,
and
he
did
not
even
know
in
other
words
that
there
was
any
crime
that
had
been
committed.
he
only
knew
as
he
testified
that
someone
had
perished
in
the
file.
at
the
time
of
the
questioning
petitioner's
answers
were
clear
and
coherent.
he
stated
that
he
awoke
at
7:40
that
morning,
that
he
smelled
smoke,
that
he
was
attacked,
that
he
went
down
the
basement,
that
he
was
attacked
and
there.
this
was
the
same
basic
story
that
petitioner
told
in
later
interviews
and
at
the
trial.
between
the
time
of
the
arrival
on
the
scene
and
10
o'clock
of
the
fire
and
10
o'clock
that
morning,
back
at
the
scene
it
was
ascertained
that
the
fire
was
the
result
of
arson,
in
that
there
were
five
separate
and
independent
fires
which
were
started
by
the
use
of
turpentine,
and
that
the
gas
lights
had
been
opened.
thereupon
sergeant
kocher
returned
to
the
hospital,
it's
now
10
o'clock
on
the
morning
of
the
fire.
petitioner
is
still
in
the
examining
room
and
he
is
asked
these
five
separate
fires
and
the
gas
blast
and
he
says
that
they
must
have
been
started
by
this
man
who
attacked
him.
but
stationary
was
also
found
on
the
scene
and
petitioner
was
asked
whether
he
had
been
writing
any
letters
and
he
denied
it.
at
about
2:10
the
same
day
petitioner
was
taken
to
the
district
of
columbia
hospital.
he
was
at
this
time
placed
in
a
locked
ward
with
a
dozen
other
patients
and
a
police
guard.
this
is
the
earliest
time
that
it
can
be
said
that
petitioner
was
in
police
custody.
in
this
respect
the
opinion
of
judge
bazelon
dissenting
below
is
significant.
because
judge
bazelon
states
that
on
tuesday
afternoon
to
thursday,
he
petitioner
was
under
arrest
and
the
statements
here
in
question
are
those
obtained
from
him
during
that
period
in
interrogations
by
two
policemen
and
two
fire
inspectors.
but
from
tuesday
afternoon
judge
bazelon
says,
and
it
would
appear
from
this
that
he
does
not
address
himself
to
the
question
of
the
admissibility
of
the
testimony
with
respect
to
the
questioning
on
tuesday
morning
at
a
time
when
petitioner
was
really
not
under
any
form
of
police
detention.
since
the
story
which
petitioner
told
on
tuesday
morning
was
in
all
substantial
assessment,
the
identical
story
as
he
told
on
later
occasions
it
is
clear
that
that
no
right
(inaudible)
was
prejudiced
by
the
admission
of
this
evidence
into
testimony.
under
the
mitchell
case
a
confession
made
immediately
after
arrest
is
not
invalidated
ab
initio
by
virtue
of
a
subsequent
unlawful
detention.
therefore
even
if
it
was
assumed
arguendo
that
there
was
such
a
subsequent
unlawful
detention,
petitioner
has
not
contested
it
by
the
testimony
adduced
by
the
government
at
this
stage.
the
questioning
on
the
afternoon
at
the
time
when
petitioner
was
in
the
locked
ward,
(inaudible)
previously
as
told
to
the
investigating
officer
and
there
was
no
questioning
on
the
27th,
the
wednesday
without
following
the
file.
the
petitioner
was
again
questioned
on
thursday
the
28th.
at
the
trial
there
was
held
voir
dire
to
determine
the
admissibility
of
these
prearrangement
statements
and
at
that
voir
dire
defense
counsel
(inaudible)
evidence
which
the
government
could
have
easily
put
to
trial
because
this
is
after
all
a
second
trial,
a
retrial
specifically
waived
any
objection
to
the
introduction
of
testimony
with
respect
to
the
questioning
on
the
28th.
this
case
is
entirely
unlike
the
mallory
case
where
there
was
a
situation
created
by
the
investigating
officer
designedly
or
otherwise
during
which
there
was
the
opportunity
to
extract
the
confession.
this
is
not
the
case.
even
as
the
dissenting
judge
concedes
the
delay
in
arraigning
the
petitioner
was
an
unavoidable
delay
and
not
created
by
the
government.
i
would
like
then
to
direct
myself
to
the
question
of
the
remarks
made
by
the
government
attorney
in
summation.
and
the
claim
of
these
remarks
prejudiced
petitioner
because
they
minimize
the
responsibility
of
the
trial
judge.
we
content
that
the
remarks
of
the
government's
attorney
in
the
context
of
this
trial
did
not
constitute
prejudicial
error.
we
know
at
the
outset
that
no
objection
was
made
to
these
remarks
prior
to
the
verdict.
there
was
or
hasn't
been
claimed
that
the
trial
judge's
instructions
to
the
jury
were
in
any
way
improper.
although
the
defense
counsel
was
specifically
given
an
opportunity
to
submit
any
kind
of
instructions
to
the
jury
subsequently
to
these
remarks,
he
did
not
avail
himself
of
that
opportunity.
under
the
felony
murder
statute
imposition
of
the
death
sentence
by
the
trial
judge
is
mandatory.
this
fact
emphasizes
that
the
role
of
the
jury
in
this
case
is
simply
a
fact
finding
function.
there
was
--
it
was
not
open
to
the
jury
in
this
case
to
make
any
recommendation
with
respect
to
sentencing
and
so
there
was
no
occasion
for
the
jury
to
get
into
that
area
of
the
case.
its
functions
were
simply
a
fact
finding
functions
and
although
the
imposition
of
the
death
sentence
by
the
trial
judge
was
mandatory,
it
was
not
of
course
inevitable
that
that
sentence
to
be
ultimately
be
carried
out.
defense
counsel,
however,
sought
to
create
the
impression
that
the
function
of
the
jury
was
not
merely
to
find
the
facts,
but
also
to
impose
sentence
or
as
you
put
it
to
send
the
defendant
to
the
electric
chair
and
the
death
sentence
was
not
only
mandatory,
but
that
its
exposition
was
inevitable.
mr.
sand
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
avert,
if
i
may,
to
the
question
of
double
jeopardy
and
attempt
to
clarify
the
answers
which
i
gave
to
the
question
asked
by
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
by
mr.
justices
frankfurter
and
--
and
black.
i
stated
that
there
was
no
difference
between
the
case
where
the
verdict
returned
if
one
of
guilt
at
second
degree
murder
and
the
case
where
the
verdict
which
the
jury
returned
to
one
count
and
in
--
and
in
an
indictment
of
not
guilty
of
first
degree
murder,
guilty
of
second
degree
murder.
there
is
no
difference
in
legal
consequence
between
those
two
cases
under
the
view
of
the
trono
case
and
under
the
view
of
the
american
law
institute.
but
if
we
want
to
put
to
one
side
these
cases,
one
could
have
cause
distinguish
between
the
cases
where
the
jury
is
absolutely
silent
and
the
case
where
there
is
a
specific
finding
of
acquittal,
where
there
is
silence
on
the
part
of
the
jury,
for
example,
that
silence
may
be
the
result
of
disagreement.
the
jury
--
there
maybe
a
hung
jury
with
respect
to
a
particular
degree
of
a
crime
and
of
course
a
hung
jury
has
never
in
--
in
recent
times
consort
to
be
tantamount
to
an
acquittal.
the
jury
may
never
have
considered
the
--
that
degree
of
the
crime
to
which
it
returned
no
verdict.
the
government
therefore
went
to
some
lengths
in
its
brief
to
show
that
in
no
respect
may
this
verdict
of
the
jury
at
the
first
trial
explicitly
or
implicitly
be
read
as
a
finding
of
acquittal
of
first
degree
murder.
there
was
of
course
no
such
statement
by
the
jury.
the
jury
merely
returned
a
verdict
of
guilt
in
--
in
the
second
degree.
we
do
know
however
from
the
other
findings
of
the
verdict
--
of
the
jury
with
respect
awesome
count
and
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
did
cause
the
death
of
the
victim
that
the
jury
found
that
in
fact
all
the
elements
of
the
crime
of
first
degree
murder
under
the
felony
murder
statute
was
satisfied.
therefore
if
--
if
the
rule
which
were
to
be
adapted
were
one
which
were
to
distinguish
between
the
case
where
the
jury
returned
an
explicit
verdict
of
not
guilty
or
acquittal
and
the
case
where
it
nearly
returned
a
verdict
of--
of
a
lesser
included
offense.
this
--
whether
to
be
that
distinction
drawn,
then
this
case
clearly
would
not
violate
double
jeopardy.
mr.
sand
i'm
--
i'm
aware
that
in
some
states,
the
practice
is
--
is
to
require
that
the
various
degrees
be
set
forth
in
different
counts,
in
which
case
there
is
a
verdict
returned
in
--
on
each
count.
that
of
course
is
--
is
not
the
--
the
federal
fact
--
mr.
sand
not
in
no
terms
mr.
justice
black,
but
the
question
arises
when
there
is
an
attempt
to
retry
the
defendant
for
the
greater
offense
and
of
course
it
is
clear
that
where
there
is
a
conviction
for
the
less
or
an
acquittal,
for
the
lesser
offense
then
retrial
for
the
greater
offense
is
precluded.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
when
there
is
the
second
trial
for
the
greater
offense,
the
defendant
is
in
jeopardy
on
the
lesser
count.
therefore,
he
is
being
placed
twice
in
jeopardy
for
the
lesser
offense,
the
offense
for
which
he
was
found
guilty
at
--
at
the
first
trial.
mr.
sand
the
--
the
--
that
would
be
the
rationale
in
--
in
a
limited
way
of
a
state,
in
a
state
which
said
that
the
effect
of
the
conviction
for
the
lesser
included
offense
is
--
is
the
effect
of
the
reversal
of
such
a
conviction.
it's
not
to
eradicate
the
entire
judgment.
that
was
--
is
for
example
the
reasoning
of
the
--
of
the
state
court
in
people
against
stallings,
recently
specifically
rejected
by
this
court
in
--
in
the
trono
decision.
my
point
and
if
i
may
state
it
again
is
that
under
the
holdings
of
this
case
and
--
and
trono
and
--
and
then
brantley
and
under
the
view
of
the
american
law
institute,
it
would
make
no
difference
whether
the
jury,
with
respect
to
a
single
count
of
the
indictment,
and
that
is
the
only
situation
we
have
here.
we're
not
faced
with
the
problem
of
multiple
counts
where
of
course
this
court
has
said
that
different
counts
of
an
indictment
are
as
if
they
were
separate
indictments.
where
in
response
to
the
one
count,
the
jury
returns
a
verdict
of
--
in
so
many
words,
not
guilty
of
first
degree
murder,
guilty
of
second
degree
murder,
but
under
the
trono
case
and
the
american
law
institute
view,
that
would
make
no
difference.
retrial
for
first
degree
murder
would
be
permissible
that
the
facts
in
trono
are
--
are
exactly
that.
where
a
distinction
to
be
made
between
the
two
types
of
cases
on
the
theory
perhaps
that
where
the
jury
is
absolutely
silent,
we
do
not
know
whether
they
ever
considered
the
count,
whether
they
considered
the
count
and
did
not
agree
or
for
any
other
reason,
did
not
in
fact
pass
upon
the
defendant's
guilt
of
that
degree
of
crime.
and
if
the
--
the
rule
to
be
annunciated
by
this
court
in
a
case
which
presented
such
a
problem
where
that
such
a
finding
would
preclude
retrial
and
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
it
is
clear
that
retrial
for
the
greater
offense
would
not
be
precluded
because
here,
not
only
was
there
no
finding
by
the
jury
of
acquittal
of
the
greater
offense.
but
by
looking
at
the
--
at
the
facts
of
--
of
the
--
the
necessary
implications
of
the
verdicts
returned
at
the
first
trial,
we
know
that
the
jury
found
that
the
defendant
was
guilty
of
arson.
we
know
that
the
jury
found
that
the
victim
died
as
a
result
of
that
arson.
mr.
sand
the
verdict
was
reversed,
mr.
chief
justice,
at
the
petitioner's
behest,
where
if
not
to
be
held
--
this
was
a
problem
which
the
founding
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
sand
the
only
verdict
which
was
returned
with
respect
to
the
murder
count
of
the
indictment.
mr.
sand
well,
there
was,
your
honor,
under
the
--
under
the
federal
law.
a
reverse
of
not
only
of
so
much
of
the
--
of
the
error.
it
is
one
error
here
of
permitting
the
jury
to
return
a
verdict
to
second
degree
murder.
it
was
not
the
reversal
only
of
so
much
of
the
error
has
--
has
prejudiced
the
petitioner,
but
the
perpetuation
of
so
much
of
the
error
as
operated
to
his
benefit.
here,
were
the
error
not
--
had
the
error
not
been
committed.
we
do
not
know
what
that
first
jury
would
have
done,
but
we
have
--
we
have
a
good
idea
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
there
was
a
retrial
with
the
same
evidence
and
in
the
absence
of
that
error
there
was
a
verdict
of
guilty
of
first
degree
murder.
this
error
prejudiced
both
--
both
the
--
both
the
defendant
and
the
governor
--
and
the
government
in
the
words
of
--
of
mr.
justice
douglas
in
the
safer
case,
it
tainted
the
entire
verdict.
in
no
sense
therefore
can
that
verdict
a
part
from
the
error
which
was
the
very
error
which
caused
the
reverse
he
said
to
represent
an
acquittal
of
--
of
the
defendant.
mr.
sand
i
--
i
--
i
--
i'm
not
certain
that
i
understand
the
hypothetic
--
mr.
sand
well,
this
--
this
was
a
problem
which
the
court
did
not
decide
in
the
--
in
the
burton
case,
but
this
court
has
said
that
separate
counts
of
--
of
an
indictment
are
as
if
they
were
separate
indictments.
mr.
sand
no,
mr.
justice
black.
it
--
it
is
not
true
because
the
jury
returned
but
one
finding
on
that
one
count.
mr.
sand
well,
it's
not
one
case
but
--
but
it's
a
comparison
of
the
holdings
in
--
in
the
harding,
the
trono
and
the
brantley
cases
and
--
and
which
states
that
--
that
rare
convicted
for
the
lesser
offense,
the
defendant
can
be
tried
for
the
--
for
the
greater
and
the
holding
of
this
court
and
i
believe
it's
dunn
against
the
united
states
that
separate
counts
of
an
indictment
are
--
are
as
if
they
were
separate
--
as
if
they
were
separate
indictments.
the
--
the
government
emphasizes
now
as
it
emphasized
in
its
brief
that
this
case
is
in
many
respects
an
a
fortiori
case
as
i
have
said
from
trono,
the
broad
implications
of
the
trono
decision
and
whether
in
all
of
the
--
of
the
hypothetical
situations,
some
of
which
have
been
presented
in
--
in
questions
by
the
justices.
retrial
would
violate
double
jeopardy
on
that
now
before
this
court.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
very
peculiar
because
the
theory
of
the
reversal
was
that
there
could
only
be
--
this
could
only
be
the
greater
offense
because
we
know
from
the
verdict
of
the
jury
at
the
first
trial
that
they
found
in
fact
all
the
elements
of
felony
and
murder
because
the
nature
of
the
error
which
was
a
single
error
tainted
the
entire
verdict.
one
might
have
for
instance,
the
case
where
a
defendant
is
on
trial
for
a
first
degree
murder
and
is
convicted
of
man
--
manslaughter
or
it
is
convicted
of
second
degree
murder
and
there
was
an
error
at
the
trial
with
respect
to
the
difference
between
second
degree
murder
and
manslaughter
where
the
nature
of
the
error
did
not
in
any
way
touch
the
greater
offense.
it
is
conceivable
there
that
the
court
would
hold
that
where
the
error
was
of
such
a
nature,
so
that
it
obviously
do
not
affect
the
jury's
deliberation
with
respect
to
the
first
degree
murder
count,
that
they
would
then
be
found
an
implicit
acquittal
of
first
degree
murder.
i'm
not
urging
that
rule
on
this
court.
i'm
saying
that
it
--
it
is
a
rational
rule.
it
would
be
a
rational
rule,
but
that
is
not
this
case,
because
here,
the
very
error
which
led
to
the
reversal
was
the
error
which
--
which
prejudiced
both
the
government
the
defendant
and
lead
to
the
juries
returning
a
verdict
on
second
degree
murder.
mr.
sand
yes,
mr.
justice
warren,
if
there
were
no
verdict
returned
on
the
murder
count,
then
--
then
there
is
--
then
there
is
a
hung
jury.
mr.
sand
he
--
he
can
be
retried
for
--
for
murder
and
i
would
like
to
emphasize
this.
there
were
two
counts
in
this
indictment,
one
was
a
murder
count
the
other
was
an
arson
count.
when
the
jury
returned
its
verdict,
they
were
asked
whether
there
was
verdict
on
--
on
the
murder
count
in
--
in
the
hypothetical
which
you
suggested
mr.
chief
justice.
the
--
the
jury
would
be
silent.
they'd
be
asked
--
the
foreman
would
be
asked,
“have
you
reached
the
verdict
on
the
--
on
count
two
of
the
indictment?”
and
there
would
be
no
answer.
at
that
point,
i
would
supposed
that
the
--
that
the
trial
judge
would
--
would
inquire
whether
the
jury
was
--
was
divided.
and
if
it
was
divided,
they
would
--
they
send
the
jury
back
for
further
deliberation
--
mr.
sand
--
only
discharge
the
jury
as
a
hung
jury.
mr.
sand
i
--
i
think
that
that
would
be
the
case
where
arson,
a
lesser
included
offense
of
murder
were
these
all
one
crime
or
lesser
degrees
of
a
crime,
but
these
were
two
separate
crimes.
arson
is
not
a
lesser
included
offense
of
murder.
therefore,
had
--
had
there
been
complete
silence
on
the
part
of
the
jury
with
respect
to
the
--
that
count.
under
--
under
federal
practice,
the
jury
would
have
either
been
sent
back
or
would
have
been
discharged
and
under
no
sense
would
--
would
the
defendant
have
been
--
have
been
precluded
with
retrial,
be
precluded
because
--
mr.
sand
i
--
i
have
difficulty
with
the
hypothetical,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
because
i
--
i
think
under
federal
practice,
it
just
doesn't
happen.
mr.
sand
yes.
mr.
sand
which
--
which
may
or
may
not
happen.
mr.
sand
if
--
if
there
is
a
--
i
would
think
that
unless
the
jury
is
discharged
on
those
counts
as
having
failed
to
reach
an
agreement
and
informs
the
judge
--
mr.
sand
yes.
well,
as
in
those,
i
would
think
not.
mr.
sand
now
--
mr.
sand
no.
mr.
sand
no
--
yes,
very
simple.
mr.
sand
it
would
--
that
the
result
would
not
be
that
if
--
if
the
jury
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
sand
yes
and
it's
also
a
different
--
mr.
sand
no,
no
because
the
--
the
different
counts
--
the
different
counts
of
--
of
an
indictment
and
--
and
they
stand
as
if
they
were
different
indictments
and
different
trials
on
that
indictment.
may
i
just
clarify
--
mr.
sand
well,
if
there
are
many
aspects
of
--
of
jeopardy
which
--
which
depend
on
the
--
the
form
in
which
the
--
the
charge
which
the
prosecutor
chooses
to
bring
in
the
first
instance,
whether
it's
the
greatest,
whether
it's
a
lesser
one.
mr.
sand
it
would
have
to
be
very
bad
offense.
mr.
sand
yes.
and
of
course,
if
they're
entirely
unrelated
more
than
he
has
--
have
no
business
being
in
one
indictment
under
the
--
under
the
federal
rules
and
the
defendant
could
move
to
sever
and
there
would
be
a
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
sand
that
--
that
what
is
impossible
to
conceive?
mr.
sand
i
would
think
that
under
the
federal
rules,
if
there
were
no
rational
connection
between
the
charges
that
the
--
that
there
would
be
a
misjoinder
of
counts
if
those
counts
were
in
the
same
indictment
that
the
defendant
could
move
to
--
mr.
sand
that's
a
duplicitous
count.
it's
a
bad
count.
mr.
sand
it
would
be
a
bad
count
and
it
would
be
dismissed
if
being
duplicitous
if
it
--
if
it
charged
more
than
one
crime
in
one
count.
it
would
be
bad
if
there
are
more
than
one
crime
named
in
one
count.
it
would
be
bad
if
the
indictment
contains
several
counts
which
were
factually
unrelated
to
each
other.
mr.
sand
it
--
it
is
the
fact
that
the
trial
proceedings
in
the
philippine
island
were
--
were
as
you
have
stated,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
mr.
sand
it
--
it
could
and
if
that
were
the
basis
for
the
--
this
court's
decision
in
the
trono
case.
we
--
we
would
have
an
entirely
different
situation,
but
the
court
went
at
great
pain.
it
was
a
great
pain
and
it
was
very
explicit,
both
--
both
the
majority
opinion
in
trono
and
the
dissenting
opinion
--
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
kepner
in
stating
that
because
the
language
which
was
being
construed
was
the
language
which
was
taken
word
for
word
from
the
fifth
amendment
and
from
the
bill
of
rights
that
--
that
the
question
was
before
the
court
was,
as
the
court
put
it,
as
if
the
case
arose
in
one
of
the
federal
courts
of
the
united
states.
on
the
facts,
that
distinction
could
be
drawn.
the
court
did
not
draw
that
distinction
in
--
in
trono,
explicitly
based
its
holding
as
if
it
were
construing
the
fifth
amendment
and
of
course
in
later
cases,
as
--
as
in
brantley,
the
situation
was
not
of
a
case
arising
from
this
peculiar
spanish
background
which
was
a
case
arising
in
the
united
states
with
the
trial
by
a
jury.
mr.
sand
of
--
of
course
if
--
and
this
is
also
in
response
to
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
harlan.
it's
clear
that
if
--
if
you
accept
it
the
review
--
the
view
of
double
jeopardy
of
--
of
mr.
justice
holmes
dissenting
in
kepner,
if
you
took
the
period
of
continuing
jeopardy
then
of
course
there's
just
no
--
no
question
at
all
with
the
--
that
retrial
for
first
degree
murder
would
not
violate
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
sand
i
--
i
think
it
is
clear
that
--
that
the
holmes
concurrence
in
--
in
trono
is
based
on
--
on
a
discontinued
belief
in
a
view
which
he
had
expressed
merely
a
year
or
so
before
of
the
view
of
continuing
jeopardy.
mr.
sand
on
the
bill
of
rights?
mr.
sand
oh,
yes.
i
--
i
--
there
is
an
explicit
language
in
the
trono
decision
that
the
case
is
--
as
if
it
arose.
mr.
sand
in
the
trono
decision
that
the
court
specifically
stated
that
this
case
is
as
if
it
arose
in
a
federal
court
in
the
united
states
and
the
problem
was
one
of
--
of
construing
the
--
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
sand
the
double
jeopardy
provision
of
the
--
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
sand
and
my
--
my
answer
is
--
is
yes
that
under
the
practice
in
the
philippine
court,
the
--
the
appellate
court
could
sua
sponte
have
imposed
the
greater
sentence,
but
had
it
done
so
in
the
light
of
the
provision
which
--
which
was
applicable
in
the
philippine
islands
and
which
was
verbatim
from
the
fifth
amendment.
had
it
done
so
and
had
this
court
thought
that
it
was
a
violation
of
double
jeopardy
which
were
done
so.
the
court
would
not
have
decided
trono
as
it
did.
in
other
words,
in
fact,
the
practice
in
the
philippine
islands
was
such
as
to
permit
the
reviewing
court
to
impose
a
greater
sentence
to
subject
the
defendant
if
--
if
you
will
to
continuing
jeopardy.
mr.
sand
i
--
i
--
i
believe
that
one
must
read
the
holmes
concurrence
in
trono
in
the
light
of
the
dissenting
opinion
which
is
quoted
at
--
at
great
length
in
the
government's
brief
in
kepner
because
in
that
opinion,
mr.
justice
holmes
specifically
directed
himself
to
the
question
of
limited
waiver,
to
the
--
to
the
question
which
is
now
before
this
court
and
specifically
rejected
the
state
court
rule
and
--
and
stated
that
under
his
view,
there
is
not
a
limited
way
but
there
can
be
a
retrial
for
the
greater
offense.
therefore,
i
think
that
--
that
it's
entirely
logical
and
--
and
reasonable
to
say
as
--
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
suggested
that
the
basis
for
holmes'
concurrence
in
trono
was
not
because
of
any
quantitative
result
because
of
course
the
concurrence
with
the
majority,
but
because
the
majority
was
not
clear
and
explicit
enough
in
accepting
the
view
which
--
which
he
had
suggested
in
kepner,
which
is
that
it
is
--
there
is
but
one
jeopardy
in
one
proceeding,
a
continuing
jeopardy
notion.
holmes
--
it
cannot
be
said
that
because
holmes
merely
concur,
there
were
not
four
justices
of
the
supreme
court
which
rejected
the
limited
waiver
doctrine,
because
one
would
then
have
to
completely
ignore
holmes'
view
of
--
of
double
jeopardy
and
expressed
--
mr.
sand
i
--
i
think
that
it
can't.
for
who
did
--
mr.
sand
did
--
did
not
--
mr.
sand
i
can
say
that
holmes
specifically
rejected
the
limited.
mr.
sand
limited
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
sand
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
the
four
justices
who
agreed
with
the
majority
opinion
reject
the
limited
waiver
view
and
--
and
do
no
more,
a
query
whether
they
do
more
than
that,
but
at
least
they
specifically
reject
the
limited
waiver
view
deciding
the
case
as
if
it
arose
in
the
federal
court
in
the
united
states.
there
is
mr.
justice
holmes
whose
views
is
to
double
jeopardy.
he
made
known.
i
believe
it's
a
year
earlier
in
another
case
arising
from
the
philippine
islands
in
the
kepner
case.
and
in
that
opinion,
he
too
specifically
rejected
the
limited
waiver
doctrine
and
went
--
and
went
beyond
that.
mr.
sand
well
--
mr.
sand
it
--
it
is
right
in
--
in
a
very
quantitative
sense.
mr.
sand
one
--
mr.
sand
it
is
--
it
is
of
course
indisputable
that
there
were
four
justices
who
joined
in
the
majority
opinion.
there
was
a
concurrence
by
mr.
justice
holmes.
it
is
equally,
i
think
clear,
that
at
the
time
the
trono
decision
was
rendered
by
this
court,
five
justices
made
known
their
view.
when
one
view
--
when
one
takes
trono
in
the
light
of
kepner
that
the
--
the
law
in
the
federal
courts
was
the
law
which
rejected
the
limited
waiver
view
--
doctrine.
and
in
trono
specifically,
in
the
majority
opinion,
the
court
pointed
to
the
state
court
decisions
such
as
people
against
darling
in
new
york,
not
philippine
island
decisions,
not
the
decisions
of
the
territorial
court.
the
point
to
the
opinion
of
--
of
the
new
york
court,
people
against
darling
which
was
then
a
leading
case
on
--
on
limited
waiver
and
specifically
rejected
that
doctrine.
mr.
sand
they
--
mr.
sand
and
of
course
--
mr.
sand
it
--
it
would
be
--
mr.
sand
well,
there
--
there
is
brantley
as
i
pointed
out
earlier.
mr.
sand
where
the
court?
mr.
sand
yes
but
--
mr.
sand
--
or
the
fourteenth
--
mr.
sand
--
in
fact
--
in
fact
in
that
case.
mr.
sand
in
fact,
that
case
arose
from
the
state
court.
mr.
sand
there
is
--
there
is
stroud
and
bryan
and
all
the
similar
cases
which
holds
the
consequence
of
a
--
of
a
reversal
of
a
judgment
is
to
submit
--
mr.
sand
--
retrial.
mr.
sand
of
course
--
mr.
sand
and
trono
--
trono.
they
cited
trono.
mr.
sand
who
appealed
his
trial?
mr.
sand
the
defendant
appealed
it.
mr.
sand
yes,
and
the
court
said
by
his
own
action.
in
green,
the
appeal
--
he
--
he
invoked
or
created
the
situation
whereby
he
could
be
in
a
sense
that
--
mr.
sand
oh,
oh
i
--
i
do,
mr.
justice
black,
because
--
because
as
i
said
earlier
--
first
of
all,
under
the
district
of
columbia
law,
there's
just
one,
in
essence,
one
crime
of
murder
that
this
court
said
in
the
fisher
case.
so,
one
can
say
that
both
at
the
first
trial
and
the
second
trial
as
in
stroud,
there
was
a
finding
by
the
jury
with
respect
to
the
--
to
the
one
crime
charged
which
is
murder.
also,
it's
--
it's
like
stroud
because
we
can
look
at
the
verdict.
return
to
the
first
trial
and
say
that
that
jury
found
this
defendant
guilty
of
--
of
felony
murder
and
that
they
found
the
felony
and
they
found
that
the
felony
caused
the
death,
the
--
the
return
of
the
verdict
to
second
degree
murder
was
--
was
in
many
respect
analogous
to
the
finding
of
--
of
no
capital
punishment
in
stroud.
i
--
i
think
the
case
is
very
(inaudible).
mr.
sand
thank
you.
