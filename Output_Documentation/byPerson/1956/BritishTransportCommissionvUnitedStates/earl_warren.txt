is
there
in
the
pleadings

did
so
consider
it?
chief

mr.

--
chief

you

the

work
very
well

i
understood
mr.

to
say
that
never
in
the
history
of
the
--
of
the
country
has
it
ever
been
used
in
favor
of
funds,
such
whether

law
of
this
country
would
be
applied
to
the
contracts
of
those
claimants
made
with
the
--
with
the
british
vessel.
now,
wouldn't
they
be
getting
something
different
here
than
they
would
get
--
get
over
in
holland
or
over
in
--
in
england
that
they
litigated
their
--
their
rights
under
their
contracts?
would
we
have
a
different
rule
of
â€“-
of
policy
here?

they
won't
hold

you
don't
adhere
to
that
position
of
course.

minutes
you

according
to
the
clerk.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
acheson,
may
i
ask
this
question
please.
would
it
make
any
difference
in
your
position
if
both
of
these
ships
were
american
ships?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but

is
what
i
