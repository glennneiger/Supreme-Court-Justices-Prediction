justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
acheson,
did
you
say
that
there
had
been
a
finding
affirmatively
that
the
duke
of
york
was
at
fault
in
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
would
that
issue
be
open
that
your
contention
today
is
correct
in
a
proceeding
by
one
of
the
co-claimants
in
england,
let's
say,
where
the
duke
of
york
was
found?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
anywhere?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
manners
between
the
--
among
the
co-claimants?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
excuse
me
a
minute.
may
i
ask
you
some
further
question
if
i
may
please?
if
that's
all
that
would
be
left
just
the
judgement
for
the
amount
of
their
claims,
in
what
proceeding
will
the
duke
of
york
be
able
to
have
a
limitation
of
liability
in
respect
to
the
aggregate
of
those
claims?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
dow?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
dow?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
dow,
did
you
say
that
if
the
british
company
had
not
--
the
commission
had
not
appeared
in
this
proceeding,
that
nevertheless
the
finding
that
it
was
at
fault
would
have
been
conclusive,
parted
in
the
england?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
did
you
also
say
that
if
we
had
the
british
procedure
here
of
having
liability
first
determined
and
then
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
rather
than
the
cart
before
the
horse,
as
you
described
it.
if
in
that
instance
there'd
been
a
libel
started
after
the
haiti
victory
came
back
here,
not
by
the
british
commission
but
by
american
claimants,
there
could
have
been
in
that
proceeding
a
defense
by
the
united
states
of
limitation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
in
that
instance
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
whatever
it
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
i'm
not
familiar
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
with
the
--
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
chart
and
whatever
it
is
in
any
event
in
that
libel
proceeding,
the
united
states
could
have
raised
the
issue
of
liability
of
course,
could
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh
no,
i'm
speaking
now
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
hear
me
out.
now,
what
i'm
speaking
about
is
if
we
had
the
british
procedure
rather
than
the
one
we
do
of
the
cart
before
the
horse
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
i
gather
that
the
issue
of
liability
would
have
been
raised
on
the
libel
court
by
perhaps
the
american
claimants
against
the
united
states,
isn't
that
right?
the
issue
is
a
liability
of
the
united
states.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
would
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
with
the
determination
in
that
proceeding
that
the
united
states
was
not
liable
and
even
a
determination
that
the
british
vessel
was
liable
have
been
binding
upon
the
british
commission
that
the
british
commission
did
not
appear
in
that
libel
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
not?
well
then,
wasn't
the
british
commission
in
a
position
here
where
it
had
to
come
in
to
this
procedure,
allow
under
our
law
or
else
suffer
as
you
told
me
they
would
suffer,
a
binding
--
binding
upon
them
in
england
that
they
were
at
fault?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
this
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
now,
what
about
in
a
proceeding
brought
by
american
citizens
against
the
united
states
after
the
haiti
victory
came
into
an
american
port
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
which
proceeding
the
british
commission
did
not
appear.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
would
be
the
effect
in
england
of
the
finding
exonerating
the
united
states?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
the
british
commission
didn't
go
into
that
libel
proceeding
that
litigate
the
issue
of
its
own
lability
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
would
assume
with
--
when
they
brought
it
against
the
united
states,
it
would
be
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
when
they
brought
the
libel
proceeding
against
the
united
states
after
the
haiti
victory
came
into
port,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
if
the
british
commission
were
not
a
party
to
that
libel
proceeding,
are
you
telling
me
that
nevertheless
a
finding
of
exonerating
the
united
states
and
laying
the
fault
to
the
duke
of
york
would
have
been
binding
in
england
upon
the
british
commission?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
they
came
in
because,
as
i
understand
it,
they
had
to
come
in
or
suffer
the
consequences
of
a
determination
against
them
which
would
be
res
judicata
in
england.
is
that
what
you
told
me?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
on
these
cross-claims,
was
there
any
defense
interposed
by
the
british
commission
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
stage
of
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
is
it
that
we
haven't
reached
that
stage
if
we
decide
--
determine
that
it
could
be
impleaded,
do
they
still
have
an
opportunity
to
impose
--
interpose
defenses?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
could
they
do
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
do
you
say?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
what
about
--
what
about
the
contract
stipulation
on
the
ticket,
may
that
be
interposed
as
a
defense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
can
they
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
what
about
the
contract,
the
ticket
contract
of
limitation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
whatever
it
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
no
--
but
i
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
defenses
on
the
merits
in
these
cross-claims
have
yet
been
setup
in
an
answer
to
the
cross-claims
or
otherwise,
have
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
under
--
in
the
steel
inventor
case,
mr.
doub,
were
there
other
claimants
as
well?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
they
also
recovered
from
the
united
states
after
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
acheson,
before
you
sit
down,
now
that
your
client
is
here
and
came
in
to
this
proceeding,
if
these
cross-claims
were
sustained,
is
the
british
commission
in
any
way
prejudiced
in
the
associate
of
any
defenses
inclusive
for
those
arising
under
the
ticket
contracts
or
otherwise?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
not
be?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
then
to
say
that
in
an
action
in
england
between
you
required
in
any
of
these
cross-claimants,
you
might
hope
for
a
more
favorable
result
and
you
can
under
american
law?
