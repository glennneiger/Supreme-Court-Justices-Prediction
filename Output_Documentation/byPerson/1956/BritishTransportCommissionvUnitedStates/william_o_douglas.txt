justice
william
o.
douglas
i
suppose
there's
no
british
decision
on
this
face
of
the
law
you're
speaking
out
here.you're
--
you're
making
a
conjecture
on
the
basis
of
what
practice
has
been.
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
--
what
was
the
name
of
that
case?
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
was
the
name
of
that
decision?
justice
william
o.
douglas
wasn't
that
a
recent
decision?
justice
william
o.
douglas
mr.
doub,
will
you
--
would
you
care
to
say
what
defenses
you
think
the
british
commission
could
interpose
if
these
courts
claims
do
lie
in
this
proceeding?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
suppose
if
the
british
transport
had
--
had
won
here,
below
in
the
district
court,
its
claim
appears
on
page
24,
as
i
read
the
record,
for
a
million
and
half?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
suppose
if
million
and
a
half
had
been
awarded
then
these
intervening
claimants
could've
--
could
have,
without
doubt,
proceeded
in
this
limitation
proceeding
against
the
british
transport,
isn't
that
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
this
was
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
conceivably,
they
might
have
some
recovery
against
the
transport
commission,
perhaps
not
on
negligence,
but
some
other
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
i
--
i
understood
that
the
lower
court
decisions
had
gone
that
far,
permit
the
intervening
claimants
to
file
against
the
--
the
party
for
the
limitation
proceeding
that
--
that
got
the
--
its
claim
of
statute
with
the
admiralty.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that's
the
steel
inventor
case,
isn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
they
--
they
allowed
the
intervening
claimants
there
to
proceed
against
the
--
the
claim
that
was
--
or
the
funds
so
to
speak
in
the
hands
of
the
--
of
the
shipowner
who
was
victorious.
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
that
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
the
united
states
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
united
states
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
united
states
received
an
award
in
the
steel
inventor
case.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
don't
bother,
i
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
--
i
did
--
already
did
and
i
looked
at
page
24
of
your
brief,
while
you
say
the
award
to
the
united
states
was
regarded
in
the
substitute
for
the
(inaudible).
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
right.
