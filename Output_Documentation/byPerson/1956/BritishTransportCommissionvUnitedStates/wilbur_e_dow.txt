mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
would
help
the
court
a
little
to
understand
what
this
thing
is
all
about,
before
we
go
any
further.
when
the
haiti
victory
cut
through
the
bow
of
the
duke
of
york
one
night
in
the
english
channel,
as
you
might
suppose
a
lot
of
people
were
killed,
injured,
and
lost
their
property.
now,
you
have
heard
here
that
a
104
out
of
the
115
were
from
other
parts
of
the
world,
even
as
far
away
as
australia,
so
to
let
them
sue
over
there
if
they
want
to
collect
anything.
but
five
out
of
the
eight
people
that
died
were
americans
and
they
constitute
the
bulk
of
these
claims.
now,
it
would
also
help
if
we
knew
just
what
happens
in
europe,
when
you
have
limitation
of
liability.
you
don't
have
it
as
a
label
on
the
first
proceeding
as
you
often
do
here,
it
comes
afterwards.
the
first
thing
you
do,
everyone's
who's
everybody
else,
just
as
we
usually
do
here.
and
after
there
are
suits,
and
cross-claims,
and
counterclaims,
the
court
decides
the
issue
of
liability
and
determines
under
their
rules
just
who
was
liable
and
to
what
extent.
after
that
is
completed,
the
ship
owner
looks
at
the
bill
that's
presented
to
him
and
then
decide
whether
or
not
he's
going
to
limit,
which
is
a
sensible
thing
to
do.
i
think
in
a
sense,
we
have
the
cart
before
the
horse
here
very
often.
but
we
overcome
that
by
frequently
using
limitation
of
liability
as
a
defense
like
under
the
jahncke
and
that
case
stands
for
the
proposition
that
you
can
use
it
either
way
and
i
submit
that
there
isn't
a
slightest
doubt
that
british
transport
can
limit
now
if
it
wants
to,
because
for
the
first
time
there
are
claims
against
it.
there
weren't
before.
now,
the
difficultly
here
originally
arose
because
of
the
fact
that
there
was
a
government
involved
and
a
british
vessel
which
our
government
thought
was
likewise
a
british
government
ship.
so
they
thought
it
came
under
the
knock-for-knock
agreement.
consequently,
there
were
some
confusion
and
the
thing
didn't
proceed
exactly
as
an
ordinary
case
of
this
kind
would
proceed.
ordinarily,
they
would
have
waited
until
the
vessel
got
where
she
was
going,
the
brooklyn
navy
yard
for
repairs
and
then
british
transport's
counsel
whose
office
was
there
would've
label
it.
the
government
would've
come
back
and
answered
limited,
and
claimed
against
the
british
for
their
damages.
we
would've
come
in.
and
i
only
represent
the
people
that
were
injured,
killed
and,
lost
there
baggage.
mr.
doub
will
speak
for
the
government's
aspect
of
the
case.
so
we
would've
then
come
in
and
filed
our
claims.
and
under
rule
43,
we'd
file
them
against
anybody.
now,
we
don't
have
any
admiralty,
the
equivalent
of
rule
13
(g)
of
the
civil
rules.
so,
for
one
to
have
a
better,
we
used
rule
56
or
sometimes
54
and
have
for
75
years.
it
goes
back,
it
used
to
be
rule
59.
at
first,
as
the
petitioner
pointed
out,
yes,
it
was
designed
for
collision.
but
it
was
quickly
spread
to
cargo
and
then
to
all
sorts
of
things.
now,
if
we
had
the
european
and
british
system
of
determining
liability
before
we
determine
whether
or
not
we
were
going
to
limit,
we
wouldn't
require
the
equivalent
of
rule
56
or
--
or
its
--
its
liberal
use.
who
wouldn't
need
it?
because
all
that
would
be
done
under
the
--
under
perhaps
a
very
clear
rules
permitting
implead
or
in
cross-libel.
but
just
assume
as
we
have,
as
i
say,
the
cart
before
the
horse,
we
have
to
use
rule
56
rather
liberally
in
order
to
get
all
people
before
the
court,
have
a
concourse
of
claims,
determine
liability
all
around
and
then
apportion
whatever
is
before
the
court
for
apportionment.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
we
would
have
to
libel
a
british
vessel
in
england.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
we
would.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
your
honor,
they
chose
to
come
here.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
that's
no
reason
to
prejudice
these
people.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
under
the
english
system,
your
honor,
everybody
would've
had
to
go
--
if
we
went
to
england,
everybody
would
of
course
had
to
go
to
england.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
that's
correct
and
the
united
states
did
limit
its
liability
here
in
norfolk
and
i
think
the
reason
was
because
norfolk
was
up
to
date
and
at
that
time
both
southern
and
eastern
were
five
years
behind,
and
it
was
a
prudent
thing
to
do.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
if
--
if
the
british
didn't
come
here,
then
it
would
be
a
res
judicata
over
there.
now,
and
they
would've
had
--
not
a
leg
to
stand
on
--
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
--
but
they
came
over
here
--
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
to
determine
the
fault,
yes.
and
that's
what
they
came
over
here
to
do.
and
they
said
in
their
pleadings,
the
united
states
is
--
is
not
blamed
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
sir?
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
when
you
read
the
fine
print
on
the
back
of
the
tickets
it's
res
judicata
just
about
everything
else,
too,
only
in
reverse.
these
people
have
no
claims
in
england
for
the
most
part.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
that's
right
and
they
are.
it's
against
public
policy
over
here,
but
it's
all
right
over
there,
and
they
respect
it.
the
shipowner
is
still
in
the
driver's
seat
over
there.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
all
right,
but
it's
these
people's
concern
right
here
in
this
court
now,
and
if
were
going
to
have
a
complete
adjudication
of
this
whole
controversy
in
one
lawsuit
as
chief
justice
taft
and
subsequently
chief
justice
hughes
said
in
both
the
case
against
the
southern
pacific
and
the
--
the
just
and
chambers,
then
it's
got
to
be
done
here
and
it's
got
to
be
done
in
one
litigation
that
if
you
can
litigate
this
thing's
a
piecemeal
all
over
the
world,
then
there's
--
there's
nothing.
the
british
had
nothing
to
lose
coming
over
here.
they
came
over
with
fishhooks
in
their
pockets
in
an
asbestos
suit.
and
they
said,
we
want
every
bit
of
that
million
and
a
half
that
we
can
get,
and
we
deny
any
liability.
and
you
america
are
100%
at
fault
and
the
court
says
you're
mistaken
there,
you're
100%
at
fault.
and
then,
as
my
opponents
said
that
the
money
is
returned
to
the
government
and
the
matter
is
finished.
well,
within
that,
i
find
how
do
you
do.
it
isn't
finished,
there's
115
people
that
hasn't
gotten
a
nickel,
and
this
was
the
only
they're
going
to
get
it.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
your
honor,
it's
--
it's
--
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
as
--
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
that's
a
very
good
question.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
of
the
government's
admiralty
office,
which
is
one
of
the
finest
in
the
country,
has
often
said
that
while
our
civil
rules
are
suppose
to
be
all
inclusive
and
tell
everybody
exactly
what
they
can
and
cannot
do,
the
admiralty
rules
as
--
as
annunciated
by
mr.
justice
bradley
when
he
said
at
the
end
of
his
opinion
in
scotland,
i
believe
it
was,
we
will
now
--
at
the
conclusion
of
this
case,
we
will
announce
a
few
rules
and
that's
just
what
that
they
did.
the
admiralty
rules
were
always
a
few
loose
general
rules
with
the
district
courts
having
a
right
to
author
those
rules
within
the
framework
of
the
general
rules
expressed
by
this
court.
consequently,
we
have
never
attempted
in
admiralty
to
delineate
by
rule
every
single
thing
that
could
or
could
not
be
done.
now,
the
--
the
foolishness
of
trying
to
do
such
a
thing
is
apparent,
no
two
admiralty
collisions
are
alike,
there's
no
such
thing.
for
--
every
collision
has
different
people,
different
cargo
interest,
different
types
of
injuries,
they
can
be
three,
four,
five,
ten
parties
mixed
up
in
it.
there
can
be
passengers
or
not.
the
--
the
--
it
can
happen
in
the
waters
of
different
parts
of
the
world
and
with
the
flags
of
any
nation.
now,
to
attempt
to
have
a
body
of
rules
that
would
specifically
guide
the
courts
in
every
single
step
that
they
were
to
take
in
every
proceeding
would
be
something
inexhaustible,
it
wouldn't
work
and
it
couldn't
be
done.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
yes,
and
that's
substantially
--
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
it's
a
tremendous
difference.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
well,
if
you
are
going
to
narrow
the
scope
of
these
proceedings
to
the
point
where
limitation
of
liability
is
limitation
of
liability
and
nothing
more.
and
you
are
not
going
adjudge
the
question
of
fault,
or
if
you
do,
it
doesn't
do
any
good
because
there's
no
money
there
to
pay
for
it.
then
we've
got
to
--
we're
in
for
tremendous
overhaul.
when
the
british
came
in
here
--
when
the
british
came
in
here,
they
expected
to
submit
themselves
to
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
which
sits
in
equity
for
all
purposes.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
there
is
--
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
--
no
question
about
what
they
did,
the
british
didn't
figure
out
rule
56
or
what
--
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
there
is
--
there
--
your
honor,
i
submit
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
of
any
kind
or
description
where
the
british
still
hold
on
to
some
--
something
which
will
elect
them
out.
they
didn't
appear
especially
for
this
purpose
only.
they
did
nothing
of
the
sort.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
if
they
hadn't?
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
your
honor
--
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
--
in
that
--
in
that
case,
i
think
the
court
--
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
--
would
be
justified
in
striking
their
appearance
from
the
record.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
that's
right
because
it
serves
no
purpose.
you
get
--
there's
no
--
we
can't
do
complete
justice.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
that's
what
--
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
--
this
court
used
in
the
--
in
the
cases
telling
how
this
--
this
limitation
of
liability
should
be
--
should
be
handled.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
yes.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
it
maybe
which?
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
of
course
not,
i
think
it's
a
very
important
thing
that
--
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
--
they
subjected
themselves
too.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it
is.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
oh,
no,
i
never
said
it
was
nothing.
i
think
it's
something
that
should
be
enforced.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
if
you
don't
get
money
from
a
judgment,
you
--
what's
the
use
to
having
it?
yes,
sir?
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
it.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
limitations
--
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
you
say
a
defensive
limitation?
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
--
the
exact
term
--
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
he
had
in
it's
--
in
it's
--
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
--
limitation
of
liability
petition
--
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
--
it
said
you're
not
liable
they
--
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
yes.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
would
have
been
raised
at
that
time?
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i'm
sorry.
i'm
--
i'm
afraid
i
misunderstood
you.
if
our
court
found
that
the
british
was
100%
liable
and
we
were
blameless,
even
though
the
british
didn't
come
in,
they
would
be
bound
by
that.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
yes.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
yes.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
i
think
--
still
think
it
would
be
res
judicata
if
the
court
--
if
the
court
shall
decide
it.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
well,
the
--
the
people
who
were
injured
will
make
--
would
make
their
own
allegations
of
liability
on
the
part
of
someone.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
yes.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
your
honor,
we
say
over
here,
our
courts
have
said
that
finding
is
res
judicata.
ordinarily,
the
courts
of
--
of
the
maritime
courts
of
the
world
respect
the
findings
of
our
courts.
now,
and
--
and
i'm
sure
that
that
would
happen.
what
--
the
issue
that
--
that
the
petitioner
has
raised
here
is
even
if
you
will
get
a
judgement
against
us,
a
claim
against
us
here
and
you
go
over
to
europe
to
enforce
it,
you
may
not
get
anything
anyway.
well,
it's
a
threat.
it's
true,
we
might
not.
in
many
cases,
we
wouldn't.
but
the
british
came
into
this
with
the
idea,
as
stated
in
their
pleadings
that
they
were
blameless
and
that
the
united
states
were
solely
at
fault.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
your
honor,
they
had
to
come
in
if
they
were
to
get
any
part
of
the
fund.
they
wanted
money.
they
couldn't
get
it
unless
they
did
come
in
and
they
believe
that
they
were
entitled.
the
court
held,
otherwise,
they
were
firmly
convinced
that
they
were
going
to
get
a
good
part
of
that
money.
and
when,
to
their
complete
astonishment
and
surprise,
and
mine
as
well,
they
were
held
solely
at
fault.
then
they
said,
well
under
rule
56,
we
pick
up
our
marbles
and
go
home,
we're
through.
we
don't
owe
anybody
anything
because
we
only
came
in
to
claim,
as
a
claimant
in
this
proceeding.
we
did
not
subject
our
self
to
the
jurisdiction,
although,
the
claimants,
if
they
had
claims
against
us.
well,
that
strikes
if
--
if
the
root
of
everything
that
limitation
of
liability
is
supposed
to
be,
which
is
a
concourse
of
claims
in
the
settlement
to
everything
in
one
litigation.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
none
whatsoever
--
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
--
except
that
that
--
mr.
wilbur

except
the
defense
that

mr.

that
you
couldn't
implead
them
under
rule
56.
mr.

oh,
yes,
of
course
these
people
were
slick

mr.

(voice

to
this
accident.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,

if
there
is
a
defense.
if
these
people
in
anyway
contributed
to
their
--
to
their
own
death
(voice

--
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,

can
over
there.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
not
here.
no,
sir,
it's
against
public
policy
here.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
we
don't.
i
say
the
--
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
if
these
people
had
to
take
their
tickets
and
their
claims
to
england
and
sue
the
british
transport
commission
there,
most
of
them
would
be
out
of
court.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
i
think
so.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
don't
think
we
will
--
we
would
enforce
a
--
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
--
a
contract.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
well,
i
had
always
--
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
i
--
yes
sir,
but
i
had
always
thought
that
any
--
any
contract
provision
of
that
contract
that
was
against
public
policy
in
this
country
would
not
be
given
effect
in
this
country
if
it
were
used
as
a
defense.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
well,
i
had
--
i
had
thought
it
was
quite
--
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
--
quite
clear.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
you
see
this
--
this
thing
was
never
have
occurred,
none
of
these
things
would
have
happened
if
the
british
transport
commission
had
libel
this
american
ship.
but
believing
that
that
was
going
to
happen
in
new
york
and
preferring
to
have
it
done
in
norfolk,
they
limited
norfolk,
then
not
--
not
having
a
claim
against
the
british
ship
because
believing
it
was
knock-for-knock,
they
may
have
not.
and
as
a
consequence,
it
stood
solely
as
a
limitation
proceeding,
although,
each
party
claims
that
the
other
was
to
blame.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
well,
they
were
--
most
of
them
made
in
holland.
the
ship
was
in
route
from
holland
to
england.
it
was
a
british
--
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
correct.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
these
people
couldn't
afford
to.
they're
scattered
all
over
the
world.
the
--
these
people
can
very
--
you
look
forward
to
--
they're
all
here
now
represented
by
eight
american
firms
of
attorneys.
if
they
all
had
to
go
to
york
and
finance
a
case
over
there,
the
situation
would
be
impossible
for
the
most
--
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
--
that
they
wouldn't
get
a
cent.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
well
--
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
well,
it
--
it
would
seem
so,
your
honor,
i
know.
it
would
seem
so.
but
actually,
i
don't
believe
that
--
that
that's
the
case.
i
didn't
mean
to
be
so
--
so
firm
that
there's
no
question
about
that
at
all.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
i
want
you
to
construe
the
implications
because
the
implications
of
rule
56,
running
all
through
the
cases
for
the
last
75
years,
make
it
clear
beyond
for
adventure
of
the
doubt
that
you
cannot
take
little
distinctions
and
the
few
little
cases
here,
magnify
them
into
differences
that
will
destroy
the
effect.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
i
--
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
the
rule
--
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
absolutely.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
the
--
the
rule
doesn't
forbid
this,
neither
does
it
authorize.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
well,
in
a
general
way,
to
bring
in
--
to
be
--
to
enable
the
party
to
bring
in
all
those
who
were
directly
concerned
with
the
case
itself.
bring
them
in
and
do
complete
justice
in
one
--
in
one
piece
of
litigation.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
your
honor,
that
doesn't
apply
to
rule
56.
judge
(voice

--
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
judge
--
i
--
i
find
it
hard
to
answer
that,
expect
in
this
way,
your
honor,
judge
brown
permitted
a
cross-claim
--
cross-libels
in
a
collision
proceeding.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
yes,
and
the
rule
was
formulated
to
support
that
opinion,
and
subsequently
extended
to
other
things.
and
i
say
that
you
don't
have
to
extend
it
to
this
case,
it's
also
already
there.
it's
there
in
a
dozen
ways,
not
in
--
in
exactly
so
that
it
affords,
but
almost
so.
the
cases
to
which
--
there's
three
or
four,
which
would
seem
to
give,
and
i
regret
i
don't
have
the
time
to
do
it.
there's
three
or
four
cases
like
the
algoma
case,
several
others.
they
would
appear
to
support
the
petitioner's
position
here,
but
an
examination
of
them
shows
that
they
do
not
--
i'm
--
i'm
sorry,
my
time
is
--
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
--
so
limited.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
this
rule,
sir,
doesn't
forbid
it
--
it
doesn't
forbid
it.
it
doesn't,
in
so
many
words,
allow
it.
but
it's
the
only
thing
we've
have
in
that
in
order
to
achieve
this
result
for
all
these
years
and
it's
done
very
well.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
no
question
about
it.
absolutely.
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
i'm
so
glad
that
we
might
--
mr.
wilbur
e.
dow,
jr.
those
words
were
lifted
out
of
context
from
a
decision
of
mr.
--
judge
learned
hand
in
the
algoma
case,
which
i
wished
i
had
more
time
to
tell
you
about.
in
a
case
where
a
petitioner
limited,
his
vessel
was
gone,
he
made
no
claim
against
anyone.
a
canadian
seeking
to
get
away
from
the
canadian
$15
a
ton
limitation,
who
likewise
wanted
to
limit
and
limit
in
the
buffalo
court
where
he
could
limit
to
do
and
get
out
of
his
15
ton
--
$15
a
ton
canadian
limitation
said,
"this
man,
by
limiting
is
suing
me."
and
judge
learned
hand
said,
“no,
that
is
not
a
suit
within
the
terms
of
this
rule.
that
is
not
a
suit
within
the
terms
of
this
rule
and
consequently
you
can't
get
out
of
it.
and
you'll
have
to
limit
in
canada
where
you're
supposed
to
limit.”
and
then
he
said
--
what
he
meant
was
this
--
this
petitioner
in
this
case
cannot
get
a
dollar
out
of
limitation
liability
proceedings
and
he
couldn't
because
he
wasn't
asking
for
any.
you
can't
get
money
you
don't
claim
before.
that's
true
of
any
limitation
of
liability
proceedings
that
stands
all
alone
and
does
not
involve
the
kilkenny
cat
fight
that
follows
as
on
the
question
of
liability.
and
without
liberal
cross
rules
back
--
cross-claims
back
and
forth,
we
can't
get
everybody
into
the
picture
and
get
the
concourse
of
claims,
but
that's
where
that
expression
came
from.
