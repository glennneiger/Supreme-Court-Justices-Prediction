supposed
the
commission
had
not
come
into
the
limitation
proceedings,
what
would
be
its
position
on
the
basis
of
its
attitude,
namely,
that
the
united
states
transport
was
to
blame?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
would
not
be
bound
by
the
limitation
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
proceedings
of
which
it
was
not
a
party?
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
talk
about
this
being
an
in
rem
adjudication
is
loose
talk.
i
mean
it's
in
rem
as
to
limitation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
as
to
claims
that
you
may
have
against
the
owner
of
the
ship
to
which
you
couldn't
be
jurisdictionally
be
compelled
to
be
a
party?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
it
have
made
any
difference
--
would
it
make
any
difference
if
the
british
commission
had
formally
just
like
a
appearing
especially
could
have
appeared
especially
in
terms?
i
understand
your
argument
is
that
it
doesn't
have
to
do
that,
but
if
in
terms
as
i've
said,
we
come
into
a
court
into
which
we
couldn't
be
dragged
because
the
atlantic
ocean
separates
us
from
service.
we
appear
in
this
court
restrictively
for
purposes
of
the
limitation
where
in
your
view
that
makes
it
--
have
made
any
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
if
--
what
you
say
if
--
if
they
--
if
they're
not
so
limited
as
a
matter
of
law
by
the
nature
of
the
proceeding,
they
couldn't
limit
themselves
by
a
piece
of
paper.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
this
is
--
this
would
not
be
a
special
appearance
challenging
the
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
the
monition
would
involve
a
complete
submission
of
every
possible
vulnerable
claim
after
this
had
become
clearly
the
law
of
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
the
monition
then
would
mean.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
the
monition
now
means,
you
go
in
to
litigate
the
limitation
fault
and
the
limitation
of
that
fund.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
--
your
--
or
the
proper
construction
of
rule
56
--
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
the
proper
construction
for
which
you
contend
is
not
restricted
to
claims
or
appearances
by
foreign
vessels.
it
would
apply,
as
it's
an
american
vessel,
would
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
construing
the
general
statute,
which
is
not
restricted
to
the
appearance
of
foreign
ships.
justice
felix
frankfurter
different
statute
or
accepted
admiralty
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
invoke
the
fact
to
judge
hough?
i
haven't
read
the
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
he
--
did
judge
hough
invoked
the
practice?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
even
the
good
deal
of
a
car
did
himself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
telling
what
these
citations
of
judge
hough's
opinion?
is
that
the
--
the
matter
of
the
court?
is
that
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
1925
a.m.c.?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
1924,
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
evidently,
it's
not
in
the
federal
report.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
have
the
english
system
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
limitation,
as
you
put
it
to
us,
how
would
you
be
able
to
proceed
in
this
country
against
the
british
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
mean
you'd
have
to
go
to
england?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that's
what
the
controversy
is
about,
isn't
it?
whether
you
should
go
there
or
be
able
to
do
this
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
understand
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
meaning
to
decide
the
case
but
i
can
assure
you,
i'm
just
suggesting
that
if
you
invoke
the
english
system,
it
carries
with
it
the
fact
you
couldn't
have
done
this
under
the
english
system
because
you
wouldn't
have
the
commission
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
the
united
states
could
limit
its
liability
or
idea
in
norfolk
as
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
the
british
commission
hadn't
come
here,
you
would've
been
helpless.
you'll
have
to
go
over
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
determination
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
fault
--
the
determination
of
fault
would've
been
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
isn't
challenged
--
but
that
isn't
challenged,
mr.
dow.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
not
challenged
that
it
would
be
a
res
judicata
as
to
fault.
as
i
understood
the
argument,
that
is
not
a
challenged.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
you
--
they
couldn't
recover
because
the
limitations
--
the
contract
of
limitations
are
respected
by
their
courts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
their
concern,
not
ours.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
whole
question
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
could
they
--
would
that
--
would
that
--
i
asked
mr.
acheson
then
i
ask
you,
do
you
think
that
would
make
a
difference
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
they
say,
we
appear
here
only
for
purpose
of
limitation
and
yet
they
followed
always
what
say
you
it
is.
would
that
make
a
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
can
have
it
both
ways?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
if
a
--
if
we'd
say
--
the
court
would
say,
we
won't
allow
you
to
appeal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
complete
justice
is
a
big
fray
from
this
world,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
does
--
it
does
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
does
do
something.
they
are
now
bound
by
the
finding
that
the
--
the
american
vessel
was
not
at
fault,
there
were
at
fault
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that's
something,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
maybe
a
good
deal.
they
can't
--
they
didn't
do
anything.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
cannot
say
that's
it's
--
it's
an
empty
thing
that
to
which
they
subject
themselves.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
suggesting
the
--
that
that
which
is
clearly
adjudicated
against
them
to
the
extent
that
--
that
this
record
held
is
something,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well
and
you
can't
say
it's
nothing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
don't
we
have
to
consider
the
implications
of
the
rule
when
we
come
to
construe
it,
we
can't
construe
the
rule,
something
existing
up
in
air?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
understand
that
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
s
the
rule
for?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
purpose
of
the
rule,
mr.
dow?
why
was
it
formulated?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
rule
doesn't
relate
to
limitations
suits,
does
it?
the
rule
wasn't
a
rule
enunciated
with
reference
to
limitation
suits.
and
when
it
comes
to
limitation
suit,
there
you
haven't
got
a
general
admiralty
doctrine,
you
have
a
legislatively
formulated
doctrine
with
limitations
and
rights.
and
therefore,
you
have
to
go
to
legislation.(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
it
becomes
important
to
see
whether
rule
56
applies
to
a
--
to
a
limitation
proceeding,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
a
limitation
proceeding,
is
that
right?
it
wasn't
a
limitation
proceeding,
that's
just
--
all
one
has
to
do
is
to
go
to
judge
brown's
opinion,
it's
clearly
not
a
limitation
proceeding.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
understand,
mr.
dow
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
an
argument
that
relied
on
the
rule.
and
if
so,
then
one
must
examine
the
rule.
i
understand
an
argument
that
says,
we're
outside
the
rule,
we
don't
need
the
rule,
we
dispense
with
the
rule,
irrelevant
to
this
controversy.
if
that
is
so,
then
you're
restricted
to
the
limitation
statute
of
1851
and
its
amendments,
and
all
the
power
of
the
court
in
enforcing
that
limitation
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you've
got
to
take
one
or
the
other
position,
as
i
see
it.
you
can't
tell
--
take
a
little
bit
of
the
rule
and
now
take
a
little
bit
of
general
equity,
and
somehow
or
other
see
what's
equity
in
the
particular
case
and
that's
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
understood
to
you
say
and
i
can
understand
the
argument
that
you
don't
need
the
--
if
the
rule
weren't
there
at
all,
you
would
make
--
we
make
the
same
argument
for
the
impleading?
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right
then
you
don't
look
at
the
rule.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you
look
at
rule,
you
got
to
look
at
the
rules.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
suppose
--
i've
heard
arguments
like
that
in
connection
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
then
they
found
beyond
the
counter
of
stand
when
it
came
up
late
to
had
a
reconsideration.
i
don't
suppose
you
could
have
stopped
the
government
by
the
remarks
you
just
read.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
think
it
makes
no
difference,
the
court
of
united
states
or
a
foreign
sovereign,
as
in
the
china
bank
case,
comes
in
and
ask
something
as
a
moving
plaintiff
and
where
it
is
brought
in
--
in
a
proceeding
that
has
a
limited
purpose
as
a
willing
of
the
claimant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
difference.
it
may
be
right
--
all
i'm
saying
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
isn't
very
refined
to
say
it
makes
a
lot
of
difference
whether
you
come
in
to
the
courts
of
the
united
states
and
say
i'm
a
(inaudible)
i
have
a
--
a
great
deal.
i
mean,
i
believe
in
the
china
bank
case
very
much
and
where
it
took
an
effect
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
hope
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
you
would
agree,
mr.
doub,
that
a
ship
chandler
can
--
couldn't
intervene
in
this
suit
and
say
now
that
the
british
commission
is
here,
we've
got
a
claim
against
it.
i
suppose
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
are
unrelated
claims?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
in
the
case
of
the
china
case,
it
would
make
any
difference
to
me
whether
it's
unrelated
or
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
then
what's
the
--
why
--
why
don't
you
--
why
do
you
shrink
from
--
from
carrying
this
to
your
position
of
saying
they're
in
court,
they're
here,
they
didn't
have
to
come
to
the
united
states
but
they're
here,
so
we'll
lift
this
claim.
is
this
admiralty?
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
a
claim
in
the
collision
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
the
shipowner
can
claim
too.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
