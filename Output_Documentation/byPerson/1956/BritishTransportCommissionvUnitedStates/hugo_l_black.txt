justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it
does
terminate
the
limitation
of
it,
what
is
the
difference
as
to
the
issues
that
can
--
that
ought
to
be
tried
and
the
evidences
to
be
introduced,
that
kind
of
proceeding
in
one
word
is
a
direct
libel
against
the
ship?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
meant
was
this.
there
are
certain
issues
that
have
to
be
tried
out
in
this
limitation
proceeding
where
the
british
company
comes
as
british
associates,
whatever
it
is,
comes
in
and
files
its
claim.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
are
the
differences
in
the
issues
that
have
to
be
tried
in
that
proceeding
and
the
issues
that
have
to
be
tried
out
if
he
--
if
it
were
to
sue
the
company
directly?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
same
effect
would
occur
--
the
suit
was
between
and
directed
not
in
the
limitation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what
is
the
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
wouldn't
that
--
would
they
do
not
determine
the
liability
of
the
united
states
ship
at
all
in
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it
found
at
fault?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
difference
is
--
is
there
any
more
difference
than
the
fact
that
a
government
would
get
out
for
less
because
it
has
limitation
proceedings,
that
it
would
--
there
were
direct
suits
without
limitation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
be
left
for
the
claimant
and
the
new
ship?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
total
--
that's
all
that
would
be
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
where
would
you
think
these
lawsuits
occur?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
would
the
british
company
lose
anything
by
having
a
value
of
this
claim
fixed
here
and
then
finally,
simply
say,
“we
our
only
liable
to
the
amount
of
the
percentage
of
the
total
on
our
british
men
limitation
act?”
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
they
would
have
to
relitigate
to
some
extent
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
amount
due
by
reason
of
that
difference
in
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand
that.
you
mean
that,
if
it's
the
law
of
this
country
--
i
can
understand
why
they
might
relitigate
any
of
them,
because
it
says
that
it
couldn't
be
properly
litigated
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
they
would
say,
they
would
review
our
decisions
to
see
whether
we
should
have
taken
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can
understand
that
argument
if
you
--
you're
saying
that
they
just
want
to
separate
res
judicata
and
the
reference
to
the
amount
because
they
have
their
own
laws
and
their
own
rules
to
determine
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand
how
it
would
make
any
difference
if
they
might
have
thought,
we
would
hold
this
and
didn't
have
jurisdiction
all
over
again.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
--
let's
assume
now
that
they
looked
at
it
and
said
they
were
right.
they
knew
it
and
they
went
in
there
with
that
knowledge.
do
you
--
is
it
your
position
that
you've
looked
into
it
that
the
british
courts
would
accept
it
as
res
judicata
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
as
to
the
amount.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
would
accept
it
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
just
about
to
ask
you,
do
you
ever
think
that
question
was
asked
about
something
you
had
said?
do
i
understand
from
you
that
the
only
way
this
could
be
justified
is
the
use
or
under
rule
56?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
those
rules
exhausted?
does
that
mean
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
no
--
no
power
left
in
admiralty
to
sanction
its
rules
as
it
goes
along
in
connection
with
this
sign?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
it's
against
public
policy
if
we
adjudicated
claim
against
england
on
that
english
contract
to
recognize
the
law
of
england
in
finding
as
--
is
that
before
us
here?
why
do
we
have
to
decide
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
don't
they
investigate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
say
that's
because
there's
a
valid
contract
in
england,
so
they
recognized
that
the
valid
contract
and
you
say
that
if
it's
--
we
tried
over
here,
we
tried
on
to
our
law
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
law
of
the
united
states,
which
is
to
permit
the
united
states,
would
be
against
public
policy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
have
been
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
haven't
yet
been
decided
as
that
would
have
to
be
decided,
wouldn't
it,
it's
either
there
or
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
we
have
a
right
to
setup
as
a
defense
that
it
was
governed
by
the
laws
of
england
or
wherever
it's
tried.
justice
hugo
l.
black
unless
sometimes
it
will
say
yes
or
sometimes
it's
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
always,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
these
contracts
made
in
england?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
--
and
you
made
a
rather
--
presented
a
rather
strong
point
the
other
side
of
the
--
where
they
are
arguing
that
they
--
they
would
lose
valuable
rights
which
they
are
entitled
to
under
the
laws
of
their
country,
they
should
be
tried
over
here
instead
of
over
there.
if
--
if
what
you
say
is
correct,
whether
it
would
be
decided
in
the
case
or
not,
it
is
certainly
true
that
they
can
show
a
very
substantial
loss
to
them
--
themselves
and
that
this
country
would
refuse
to
recognize
the
obligation
between
them
and
the
people
who
were
there
which
would
be
binding
over
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
understand
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that's
an
argument
--
that's
an
argument
on
your
side.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
seems
to
me
like
if
what
you're
saying
that
it
being
definitely
subtle
that
this
country
will
not
recognize
the
contract
which
is
binding
in
the
country
where
it
was
made,
that
you're
giving
a
pretty
strong
argument
to
the
other
side
for
the
--
for
the
equities
of
the
situation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
case
from
which
you
read?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand
that
while
they
could
sue
him,
bring
a
separate
suit,
go
to
that
trouble
and
then
somebody
move,
and
it's
moved
and
have
it
consolidate
it,
they
couldn't
do
it
directly?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
does
it
mean
that
although
they
can
do
it
by
the
secured
dismiss
and
to
file
a
different
suit,
they
cannot
do
it
unless
in
the
main
suit
itself
expose
of
all
limit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
permit
to
americans.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you've
got
to
go
--
that
circuit
before
he
can
get
in
to
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
they
couldn't
set
that
up
at
the
--
defense
in
their
own
courts
than
how
much
they
would
pay
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
argument
that
they
could.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
the
judgment
has
been
obtained
over
here
fixing
the
amount
and
goes
to
england.
do
you
mean
that
they
would
not
have
power
in
their
courts
to
say
that
while
that
--
this
is
the
amount
would
have
been
due
or
under
their
judgment,
we
can
fix
this
amount?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
then
they
--
they
would
have
arrived
under
their
law
still
to
setup
their
limitations?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
contract
to
a
right?
