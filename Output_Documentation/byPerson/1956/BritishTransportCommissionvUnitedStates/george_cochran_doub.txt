mr.
george
c.
doub
may
it
please
--
if
the
court
please.
the
artificial
scholastic
character
of
the
position
of
the
duke
of
york
is
indicative
by
a
number
of
factors.
first,
the
character
of
a
limitation
and
exoneration
proceeding
in
an
american
court.
now,
this
court
has
said
that
it
partakes
of
a
bill
for
interpleader,
a
bill
to
restrain
a
multiplicity
of
suits,
a
creditors
bill
and
i
add,
and
this
is
never
been
included
in
any
opinion,
but
i
add
a
petition
for
a
declaratory
judgment
of
liability
because
under
our
system
of
admiralty
limitation
procedure,
the
petitioner
is
not
only
attempting
to
limit
his
liability,
but
he
his
attempting
to
obtain
exoneration,
a
declaratory
judgement
that
he
and
his
vessel
are
not
liable.
now,
what
has
the
--
what
is
a
theory
and
philosophy
of
--
of
this
procedure
which
this
court
has
declared?
what
is
the
approach
that
it
should
take
to
this
problem?
well,
chief
justice
taft
said
this,
as
long
ago
as
1927
in
the
hartford
accident
company
case
he
said,
“this
procedure
defines
a
broad
equitable
purpose.
it
should
be
designed
to
facilitate
a
settlement
of
the
whole
controversy
with
all
the
ease
with
which
rights
can
be
adjusted
in
equity
and
that's
intended
to
be
given.”
he
said,
“it
is
the
administration
of
equity
in
an
admiralty
court.”
he
said
again,
“it
looks
to
a
complete
and
just
disposition
of
a
many
cornered
controversy.
to
hold,
otherwise,
would
be
that
unless
the
petitioner
wins,
the
court
does
not
have
the
power
to
administer
justice."
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
nor
in
the
rules
that
require
so
futile
a
conclusion.
now
here,
the
british
transport
commission
as
to
obtunding
that
unless
he
had
won
in
the
limitation
proceeding,
the
admiralty
court
was
without
power
to
grant
any
affirmative
relief
against
it.
mr.
george
c.
doub
i
was
reading,
mr.
justice
black,
in
hartford
accident
company
in
1927.
and
chief
justice
hughes
adopted
that
language
in
1941
in
just
against
chambers
and
those
were
unanimous
opinions.
mr.
george
c.
doub
first,
contrary
to
the
brief
of
our
distinguished
adversary,
they
will
be
able
to
defend
on
the
ground
of
limitation
of
liability.
under
the
jahncke
case,
that's
six
months
limitation
to
make
that
defense
has
been
deemed
only
applicable
to
an
original
limitation
decision
--
mr.
george
c.
doub
--
such
as
ours.
mr.
george
c.
doub
now,
we
know
nothing
about
the
ticket
business
--
mr.
george
c.
doub
i
say
this
--
i
say
this
that
my
impression
was
that
an
american
court
would
apply
english
law
at
a
contracts
made
in
england
but
that's
merely
an
impression.
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
corner
of
the
--
of
this
litigation.
mr.
george
c.
doub
but
suppose
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
c.
doub
no,
because
the
district
court
denied
any
standing
in
the
claimants
to
cross-claim
against
the
british
transport
commission,
and
in
that
connection
must
--
mr.
justice
brennan,
may
i
point
the
extent
to
which
this
commission
became
a
party
to
this
proceeding.
it
didn't
merely
file
a
claim.
it
filed
an
answer
as
well
as
a
claim
for
$1,500,000.
it
denied
the
principle
allegations
of
the
government's
petition.
it
denied
we
were
entitled
of
limitation.
it
denied
we
were
entitled
to
exoneration.
it
asserted
--
it
put
in
issue
its
own
negligence.
it
asserted
this
collision
was
attributable
solely
for
the
negligence
of
the
haiti
victory.
it
denied
that
the
duke
of
york
was
at
fault.
it
litigated
that
in
the
same
way
it
would
have
done
so
if
it
had
filed
a
libel
against
the
haiti
victory
and
we
had
cross-libel.
the
issues
were
identical
and
they
had
to
be
because
in
an
admiralty
collision
case,
you
cannot
determine
the
fault
of
one
vessel
without
considering
the
fault
of
the
other.
the
negligence
of
each
vessel
is
inseparable.
in
other
words,
the
subject
matter
was
not
merely
the
fault
of
the
haiti
victory.
the
subject
matter
was
the
collision,
as
justice
learned
hand
has
said,
was
the
collision.
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
the
district
court
set
this
case
down
for
hearing
in
a
pretrial
order
he
said,
“the
issues
will
be
limited
to
the
liability
of
the
haiti
victory
and
the
liability
of
the
duke
of
york.”
may
it
took
no
exemption
to
that,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
their
answer
when
they
came
in
they
said,
“we
accept
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court."
mr.
george
c.
doub
mr.
justice
harlan,
we
did
not
file
a
cross-libel
or
cross-claim
explicitly
against
the
duke
of
york.
and
we
didn't
do
it
because
the
united
states
had
an
executive
agreement
with
great
britain
which
provided
that
if
there
was
a
collision
between
two
vessels,
the
great
britain
and
the
united
states
government,
claims
would
be
waived.
we
were
up
--
we
believed
and
our
state
department
believed
that
a
vessel
owned
by
the
british
transport
commission
was
a
public
vessel
and
within
that
executive
agreement,
which
is
known
as
the
knock
for
knock
agreement
of
1942.
so
you'll
find
references
in
our
pleadings
to
the
fact
that
this
vessel,
the
duke
york
was
under
that
agreement,
so
we
did
not
feel
free
to
assert
a
cross-libel.
as
matter
of
fact,
the
state
department
will
not
permit
us
to
do
so.
the
subject
was
then
a
matter
of
considerable
representations
by
the
british
government,
the
--
and
the
british
embassy,
and
our
state
department,
and
there
were
notes
back
and
forth
on
the
subject
as
to
wether
their
vessel
was
or
was
not
owned
by
the
british
government.
now,
the
--
as
a
result,
the
question
resolved
diplomatically
until
after
this
case
was
out
of
the
district
court
and
on
appeal.
and
then,
our
state
department
acquiesced
in
the
position
of
the
british
government.
and
in
march
1956,
we
filed
a
formal
cross-claim
against
the
duke
of
york
in
this
proceeding
which
has
not
been
adjudicated.
but,
mr.
justice
harlan,
we
believe
that
our
position
to
cross-claim
is
in
effect
the
same
as
the
position
of
the
third
party
claimants.
we
think
they
have
more
equity
than
we
do.
we
initiated
the
proceedings
--
mr.
george
c.
doub
neither
as
theirs.
no
--
there's
been
no
prejudice
to
any
parties.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
the
district
court
ruled
that
this
thirty
--
third
party
claimants
could
not
cross-claim,
he
had
a
back
rule
that
we
couldn't
cross-claim.
because
was
their
position
--
we
were
all
parties
in
our
position,
that
there's
no
distinction
to
be
made
between
the
two.
we're
not
asking
for
any
preferred
position
that
we
have
the
right
to
cross-claim,
but
the
third
party
claimants
did
not
have
such
a
right,
legalistically
and
technically
on
adopting
the
kind
that
--
mr.
george
c.
doub
--
artificial
scholastic
reasoning
of
our
distinguished
adversary,
we
might
make
such
a
position
--
mr.
george
c.
doub
it
would
be
--
mr.
george
c.
doub
yes,
by
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
george
c.
doub
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
c.
doub
well,
if
you
are
to
consider
as
that,
you
can
say
we're
full
of
traveller,
innocent
by
association
but
actually,
we
are
a
--
one
of
the
principal
parties
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
merit.
but
--
but
if
you
feel
that's
our
position,
i'd
still
point
out
that
when
you
adjudicate
the
right
of
the
third
parties
to
recover
in
this
proceeding
judgements
against
the
british
transport
commission,
you
will
necessarily
be
adjudicating
our
right
--
mr.
george
c.
doub
i
think
they're
inseparable.
mr.
george
c.
doub
well,
not
--
i
--
i
don't
mean
you
--
you
would
do
it
deliberately,
but
i
think
your
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
c.
doub
--
reasoning
will
inevitably
disposed
of
our
finding.
mr.
george
c.
doub
may
i
merely
add
this
on
this
point.
the
united
states,
as
one
of
largest
owners
and
operators
of
vessels
in
the
world,
if
you
accept
the
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
second
circuit
on
this
question
of
admiralty
procedure,
you
will
be
subjecting
in
the
future
the
united
states
to
the
same
cross-claim
liability
when
it
makes
a
claim
of
an
admiralty
proceed
--
limitation
proceeding.
and
it
may
well
be
that
the
liability
of
the
united
states
will
far
exceed
any
financial
benefit
that
we
may
obtain
as
a
proceeding
if
we're
successful
but
we
are
convinced
that
this
is
a
sound,
equitable,
fair
and
just
proceeding.
and
that's
our
real
interest
in
being
here,
mr.
justice
harlan,
regardless
of
any
future
liabilities
on
our
part
or
any
disadvantage
that
we
may
suffer
in
the
future.
mr.
george
c.
doub
the
--
[laughs]
as
early
as
1868,
this
court
have
a
siren,
we
say
determine
the
underlying
principle
that's
involved
here,
at
least
the
equitable
principle.
you
held
in
the
siren
that
although
the
government
had
an
absolute
sovereign
immunity
from
suit
in
an
admiralty
collision
case,
both
in
the
rem
and
in
personam,
where
the
government
came
in
and
sought
judicial
relief,
its
immunity
was
waived,
and
the
vessel
and
the
proceeds
became
subject
to
all
claims
upon
the
vessel.
and
in
1922
in
the
western
maid
justice
holmes
interpreted
your
decision
in
the
siren
domain,
that
whenever
the
united
states
came
into
court
to
enforce
a
claim,
“it
would
be
assumed
to
submit
to
just
claims
of
third
parties
in
respect
to
the
same
subject
matter."
and
in
the
case
of
the
thekla,
you
took
a
position
that
the
united
states
became
a
private
suitor
and
agreed
by
implication
that
justice
maybe
done
with
regard
to
the
subject
matter.
mr.
george
c.
doub
yes,
i
say,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
george
c.
doub
--
that
that
--
if
that
is
a
refined
distinction.
for
example
--
mr.
george
c.
doub
may
i
remind
you
--
may
i
remind
you
the
language
you
used,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
george
c.
doub
--
you
said
the
foreign
government
wants
our
law
like
any
other
litigant,
but
it
was
their
law
free
from
the
claims
of
justice,
and
that's
precisely
what
the
british
transport
commission
did
here.
mr.
george
c.
doub
yes.
mr.
george
c.
doub
oh,
well
no
--
no.
mr.
justice
douglas,
if
the
british
transport
commission
affected
a
recovery
against
the
united
states,
it
--
it
would
be
because
it
was
not
liable,
not
a
fault
--
mr.
george
c.
doub
--
not
negligent
and
we
were
explicitly
negligent.
so
then
the
third
party
claimants
would
recover
against
the
united
states
just
as
the
duke
of
york
did.
mr.
george
c.
doub
well,
i
don't
think
there'd
be
any
--
they
would
recover
against
the
united
states,
unless
the
--
the
british
transport
--
unless
both
vessels
were
held
at
fault,
and
the
--
in
that
case
the
third
party
claimants
would
recover
against
both.
i
think
that
might
be
the
situation
you
were
thinking
of,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
the
contention
that's
been
made
by
its
counsel
would
mean
that
it
couldn't
be
--
couldn't
even
be
subjected
to
any
liability
here,
entitled
to
all
the
benefits
of
our
law
procedure
but
not
of
its
disadvantages.
mr.
george
c.
doub
mr.
justice
douglas,
we're
in
complete
disagreement
as
to
the
interpretation
of
the
judicial
decisions
on
this
subject.
mr.
george
c.
doub
in
the
steel
inventor
case,
you
heard
a
great
deal
about
what
judge
hough
had
decided
and
yet
he
was
reversed
by
learned
hand
and
augustus
hand
in
that
very
case
--
mr.
george
c.
doub
let
--
let
me
explain
a
little
more
--
mr.
george
c.
doub
it's
more
to
it
than
that.
there,
a
destroyer,
the
united
states
destroyer
and
the
steel
inventor
colliding,
the
owner
of
the
steel
inventor
sue
--
filed
a
limitation
proceeding,
just
as
we
did.
the
united
states
intervened
just
as
the
british
transport
commission
did
and
may
decline
and
look
at
loss.
the
united
states
won
in
the
district
court,
lost
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
united
states
was
held
liable
as
for
the
--
its
exclusive
negligence
in
causing
the
act.
and
we
were
--
we
were
a
claimant,
just
as
the
british
transport
commission.
we
were
held
liable
for
all
damages
in
the
case.
and
yet
--
and
yet
it's
been
suggested
too,
there's
no
authority
to
hold
the
british
transport
--
mr.
george
c.
doub
oh,
yes.
mr.
george
c.
doub
everybody
recovered
from
us.
now,
let
me
say
this
too,
why
in
the
adah
you
had
a
--
a
limitation
petition
filed
by
the
owner
of
the
scout
and
judge
hough
held
that
the
accident
was
solely
due
to
the
negligent
loading
of
the
stevedore.
mr.
george
c.
doub
it
have
held
the
stevedore
liable
of
course
--
mr.
george
c.
doub
--
a
claimant.
mr.
george
c.
doub
now
--
mr.
george
c.
doub
well,
look
at
24
f.2d
657.
mr.
george
c.
doub
well,
i
-–
my
doubt
here,
and
i
–-
i
have
--
i
go
into
a
very
more
detail
in
that
brief.
but
there,
my
note
say
that
the
court
held
a
third
party
claimants
were
entitled
to
recover
against
the
united
states,
the
co-claimant
in
the
inventor's
limitation
proceeding.
the
court
--
mr.
george
c.
doub
--
said
the
united
states
claim
the
limitation
proceedings
amounted
to
a
right
of
suit
and
admiralty
against
the
steel
inventor,
"in
doing
so,
it
took
the
position
of
a
private
suitor
and
as
to
justice
be
done
regarding
the
subject
matter
which
was
a
collision."
mr.
george
c.
doub
well,
that
was
the
first
appeal
and
on
the
second
appeal,
they
held
mr.
rosker
might
think
the
united
states
was
so
here
for.
now,
you'll
find
in
the
city
of
boston,
the
same
principle
was
applied
in
the
adah
in
1919.
in
algoma,
i'd
like
to
point
out
what
learned
hand
said,
he
said
initially
a
limitation
proceeding
is
a
defensive
proceeding
but
he
theorized
if
there
are
cross-claims
filed
against
claimants,
it
may
become
an
offensive
action.
now,
actually,
all
we're
asking
here
is
that
you
apply
the
same
kind
of
efficient,
flexible,
fair,
and
equitable
procedure
that's
done
every
day
in
an
equity
reorganization
or
an
equity
receivership
where
there,
claimants
don't
come
in,
there'll
be
a
discharge
--
mr.
george
c.
doub
--
and
they
won't
be
able
to
recover.
mr.
george
c.
doub
well,
i
think
that's
too
extreme
statement.
its
true,
mr.
justice
harlan,
that's
its
different.
it's
true
that
you
have
a
raise
that
you
are
distributing
among
predators.
it's
true
that
where
the
receiver
sues
a
claimant
in
the
proceeding
in
effects
for
recovery
such
as
negligent
directors
and
corporate
officers,
that
he
is
recovering
a
--
an
asset
of
the
state,
that's
true
and
that's
different.
but
on
the
other
hand,
what
i'm
emphasizing
is
that
those
claimants
would
have
been
barred
from
any
participation
in
the
state
if
they
hadn't
come
in.
so
there
was
the
same
compulsion
to
come
in
and
i
say
that
in
principal
--
in
principal
that
the
point
of
view
of
a
court
adjudicating
all
controversies
and
--
and
liquidating
them,
and
disposing
of
them,
and
finalizing
the
situation
as
just
as
much
equity
and
as
just
as
much
reason
for
admiralty
to
take
hold
here,
and
do
justice
and
complete
it
as
there
is
in
the
equity
case.
let
me
point
this
out,
what
if
--
if
you
don't
--
from
that,
this
third
party
claimants
to
recover
here,
after
--
or
the
united
states
for
that
matter,
although,
that's
not
as
important
frankly
because
we
can
always
sue
on
a
foreign
country
and
we
do
it
all
the
time.
and
it's
not
--
not
the
same
hardship
on
us,
but
what
is
the
punctual
--
functional
utility
of
sending
these
people
to
england
or
holland
to
litigate
further?
what's
to
be
served
by
it?
mr
acheson
says
“liability
is
res
judicata.”
well,
if
that's
res
judicata,
if
they're
responsibility
for
the
accidents
then
determine,
why
in
the
world
shouldn't
an
american
court
give
these
people
relief
when
they
came
here
from
all
over
the
world?
mr.
george
c.
doub
no,
those
are
unrelated
claims.
mr.
george
c.
doub
that's
right.
mr.
george
c.
doub
no,
you
applied
unrelated
claim.
mr.
george
c.
doub
that's
because
admiralty
has
jurisdiction
of
this
collision
and
the
liabilities
arising
out
of
it,
and
all
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
c.
doub
or
the
claim
--
mr.
george
c.
doub
no,
i
think
there'd
be
a
logic
in
that.
mr.
george
c.
doub
well,
of
course
i
don't
understand
the
principle
that
my
colleague
annunciated
there
--
mr.
george
c.
doub
--
frankly,
i
have
always
--
i
have
always
assumed
that
--
mr.
george
c.
doub
--
any
court
applies
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
contract
was
made
--
mr.
george
c.
doub
--
in
determining
its
validity.
mr.
george
c.
doub
well
then
--
