if
the
libelant
conceived
that
he's
had
a
claim
against
the
third
party,
did
it
assert
that
claim
once
the
third
party
has
been
brought
in?
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
the
--
would
the
court
have
had
any
jurisdiction
at
all
against
the
commission
in
a
direct
suit
against
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
acheson,
a
non-bearing
question,
but
do
you
draw
a
distinction
between
the
asserted
claim
that
you
say
is
not
here
in
the
united
states
against
the
duke
of
york,
which
they've
tried
to
assert
in
this
proceeding?
and
the
claimant
said,
“being
sought
to
be
asserted
against
the
duke
of
york
by
co-claimants.”
justice
john
m.
harlan
different
questions.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you'd
say
that
it
would
--
you'd
say
that
it
might
be
that
the
united
states
could
cross-claim
in
effect
your
offset
against
the
--
against
the
duke
of
york,
but
it
doesn't
follow
us
on
that,
that
a
claimant,
it
exposes
himself
to
a
claim
of
procurement.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
wouldn't
think
you
would.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
wondering
whether
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
two
of
them.
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
if
you
proceeded
in
england,
but
because
of
your
ticket
provisions,
you
would
not
be
able
to
recover
against
the
british
commission
there.
but
if
you
sue
the
british
commission
here,
those
contract
provisions
under
our
law
will
be
disregarded
and
you
can
recover
here
whereas
you
couldn't
have
done
it
over
there?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that
makes
quite
a
difference,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
if
it
makes
quite
a
tremendous
difference
to
your
position
as
to
what
--
what
--
to
scope
these
limitation
proceedings
should
be
given.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
--
is
that
so?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
--
do
you
agree,
mr.
dow,
that
the
rule
as
written
doesn't
cover
this
kind
of
a
claim?
you
can't
rely
on
the
rule
itself.
in
other
words,
can
you
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
directly
rely
on
some
inherent
power
of
the
court
to
fashion
rules
as
they
go
along?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
one
thing
that
puzzles
me
is
how
you're
up
here?
as
i
understand
it,
the
government
had
tried
to
assert
a
cross-claim
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
against
the
british,
that
was
never
appealed
from
the
--
the
denial
of
that
right
was
never
appealed
from,
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
--
your
position
as
to
the
--
as
a
cross-claimant
has
never
been
adjudicated?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
now
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
this
question,
here
is
what
i'm
trying
to
get
straight,
maybe
i'm
confused
about
it.
so
far
as
mr.
acheson's
clients
are
concerned,
they
have
--
or
the
other
side
has
been
given
a
right
to
cross-claim
against
the
british
commission
in
this
proceeding,
that's
what
he's
complaining
about.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
far
as
the
--
so
far
as
the
government
is
concerned,
you
have
not
had
any
adjudication
below
as
to
your
right
to
cross-claim
against
the
british,
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
therefore,
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
up
there,
what
sort
of
an
amicus
or
what?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
seem
to
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
follow
at
all.
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
as
a
consequence
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
what
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
but
those
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
those
situations
are
wholly
different
from
what
we've
got
here,
except
so
far
as
this
unadjudicated
claim
that
the
government
is
concerned,
perhaps
that
--
they
bear
some
analogy
into
that
situation.
but
those
equity
receivership
places
had
nothing
to
do
with
cross-claims
between
claimants
is
easy,
nothing.
