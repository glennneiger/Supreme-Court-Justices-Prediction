mr.
dean
acheson
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
admiralty
case.
it
--
it
comes
before
the
court
on
a
limited
writ
of
certiorari
for
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
limitation
of
the
writ
restricts
the
argument
today
to
a
question
of
admiralty
procedure,
but
the
case
is
not
the
less
important,
i
hope,
because
of
that.
i
think
there
is
eminent
authority
for
the
view
that
legal
progress
is
secreted
in
the
intestacies
of
legal
procedure
and
it
is
there
that
we
have
to
look
for
it
in
this
case.
the
question
of
procedure,
which
comes
before
the
court
is
a
simple
one.
it
is
whether
“claimants”
in
a
limitation
of
liability
proceeding
may
undertake
to
subject
one
of
their
number
to
liability
by
proceeding
against
him
under
rule
56
of
the
admiralty
rules
and
this,
of
course,
requires
a
consideration
of
the
statutes
involved
and
of
the
admiralty
rules
which
are
applicable.
now,
briefly,
the
case
comes
before
the
court
in
this
posture.
the
united
states
as
the
owner
of
the
naval
transport,
haiti
victory,
which
had
run
in
to
the
british
transport
commission
across
channel
ferry
in
european
waters,
ordered
its
ship
to
return
to
the
united
states.
it
did
so
return.
it
entered
the
port
of
norfolk
and
the
united
states
there
brought
limitation
of
liability
proceedings
to
restrict
its
liability
and
also
to
ask
for
exoneration.
a
monition
order
issued
in
accordance
with
the
practice
and
115
claimants
appeared
in
the
norfolk
proceeding.
of
these
115
claimants,
104
were
residents
of
england
and
the
continent.
the
american
claimants,
the
11
american
claimants
who
entered
the
proceeding,
the
total
amount
of
their
claims
was
less
than
one-half
of
the
value
of
the
haiti
victory
and
in
sufficient
sum
to
support
by
itself
a
limitation
of
liability
proceeding.
during
before
the
file,
during
the
course
of
the
proceedings,
the
sum
of
the
claimants
undertook
to
implead
under
rule
56,
the
british
transport
commission
one
of
the
claimants
in
the
proceeding
and
sought
to
allege
that
the
british
transport
commission
was
liable
for
the
accident,
and
therefore,
it
should
respond
in
damages.
the
district
court
rejected
this
attempt
and
said
that
a
limitation
proceeding
did
not
provide
a
forum
in
which
claimants
might
adjust
their
liabilities
to
one
another.
the
united
states,
in
answer
to
the
claim
filed
by
the
british
transport
commission,
set
up
a
settle
alleging
that
this
was
under
the
divided
liability
law
where
both
ships
might
be
held
at
fault,
so
that
its
damages,
which
were
comparatively
small,
might
be
off
set
against
the
one-half
of
the
damages
which
it
might
be
called
on
to
pay,
which
have
incurred
to
the
haiti
victory.
a
trial
was
held,
and
at
the
trial,
the
haiti
victory
was
exonerated
from
liability
and
the
district
court
found
that
the
duke
of
york,
the
british
transport
commission
vessel
was
solely
at
fault.
all
parties
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
question
of
fault
was
affirmed,
and
this
court
has
refused
to
review
that
finding.
however,
on
the
procedural
question,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
district
court,
saying
that
the
precise
issue
on
which
it
reversed
the
district
court
was
whether
one
claimant
in
a
limitation
of
liability
proceeding
could
implead,
could
sue
another
claimant
in
that
proceeding.
after
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
the
record
was
remanded
to
the
district
court.
and
there,
the
united
states
filed
what
it
calls
a
cross-claim
against
the
british
transport
commission,
a
claim
seeking
to
set
up
affirmative
liability
to
the
united
states
on
the
part
of
the
british
transport
commission.
that
matter,
a
rule
of
motion
to
dismiss,
has
been
entered
and
that
is
now
pending
in
the
district
court.
it
is
not
before
this
court.
it
is
not
a
part
of
this
appeal.
though,
from
the
brief
of
the
government,
there
seems
to
be
every
probability
that
it
will
be
argued.
the
question
then
comes
down
to
consider
rule
56.
does
rule
56,
by
its
terms,
in
the
light
of
its
history,
in
the
light
of
its
analysis,
does
that
describe
a
limitation
of
liability
proceeding?
does
it
describe
as
those
who
can
take
advantage
of
rule
56,
co-claimants
in
the
limitation
of
liability
proceeding?
or
to
put
it
in
a
broader
way,
which
the
united
states
seems
to
put
it,
are
the
rules
of
procedure
in
admiralty
so
amorphous,
so
vague,
that
a
proceeding
started
to
litigate
the
liability
of
the
united
states
and
to
limit
that
liability
if
--
if
it
was
found
to
exist
can
be
turned
in
to
a
suit
by
other
parties
against
another
person?
you
know
admiralty
practice,
the
rule
of
limitation,
statute
having
to
do
with
the
limitation
of
liability
as
some
30
years
older
than
the
third
party
practice
of
rule
56.
so,
we
will
consider
with
your
court's
permission,
limitation
of
liability
first.
this
is
a
legislative
graft
upon
principles
of
admiralty.
we
hear
about
limitation
of
liability
first
in
the
french
ordinance
of
1681.
half
a
century
later,
it
crosses
the
channel
and
that
appears
in
the
statute
of
seven
--
george
ii.
then,
a
hundred
years
went
by
before
it
crossed
the
atlantic
ocean.
then,
the
steam
of
lexington
burned
at
sea
with
a
cargo
of
gold
and
as
a
result
of
that
disaster,
congress
in
1851,
enacted
the
limitation
of
liability
statute,
which
said
that
the
lost
of
a
shipowner
on
a
count
of
a
disaster
occurring
among
other
things
by
collision
might
be
limited
if
he
will
not
prevail
and
had
no
knowledge
of
the
cost
of
this
disaster.
it
might
be
limited
to
the
value
of
a
ship,
plus
the
value
of
the
freight,
which
was
then
pending.
the
idea,
the
historic
idea
of
this
practice
is
to
limit
the
risk
of
the
shipowner
to
what
is
called
the
fortunes
de
mer,
the
amount
which
is
risk
on
the
voyage
shall
be
the
value
of
the
ship
and
should
be
separated
with
the
fortune
de
terre,
which
is
the
general
assets
of
the
shipowner.
this
defense
could
be
setup
obviously,
when
one
is
proceeded
against.
that's
the
normal
way
to
do
it,
but
the
statute
contemplated
that
there
might
be
affirmative
proceedings
by
which
the
injured,
the
shipowner
who
--
whose
liability
was
at
stake
might
take
initial
action
to
raise
the
issue.
and
the
rules
were
laid
down
to
that.
it
was
left
entirely
to
this
court
to
announce
the
rules.
and
20
years
went
by
before
this
court
did
that.
finally,
mr.
justice
bradley,
in
the
case
of
norwich
transportation
company
versus
wright,
announced
that
the
court
had
given
a
thought
to
a
rather
confused
practice
which
had
grown
out
and
that
--
on
that
day,
it
was
announcing
the
admiralty
rules
which
became
the
procedural
guides
for
limitation
of
liability
proceedings.
now,
these
rules
are
quite
simple
and
they
say
that
the
proceeding
is
initiated
by
a
petition.
the
shipowner
may
file
that
petition
in
any
district
where
the
ship
may
be.
if
the
ship
is
not
in
any
district,
he
may
file
it
wherever
he
is
sued.
if
he
isn't
sued
and
if
the
ship
isn't
in
any
district,
he
may
file
it
wherever
he
wishes
in
the
united
states.
the
petition
prays
for
exoneration
from
liability
for
the
exit.
or
if
that
be
denied
for
the
limitation
of
liability
to
the
value
of
the
ship
and
her
freights,
the
petition
must
setout
the
value
of
the
ship
and
her
freights,
and
when
the
petitioner
is
someone
other
than
the
sovereign,
he
must
file
security
which
forms
a
fund
in
the
hands
of
the
court
to
be
divided
among
the
claimants.
the
rules
provide
that
a
monition
shall
issue
and
be
published
in
courts,
which
are
directed
by
the
court
issuing.
in
this
case,
it
was
published
in
the
courts
of
england,
the
monition
of
the
petition,
i
suppose
to
state
the
parties
who
have
been
injured
so
far
as
they
are
known.
and
in
this
case,
some
17
people
who
were
mentioned
by
the
united
states
in
its
petition
as
having
been
killed
or
injured
of
whom
13
were
residents
of
england
and
europe.
and
as
part
of
the
procedure,
also,
an
injunction
is
issued
by
the
court
where
the
petitioner
has
been
filed
enjoining
all
claimants
from
proceeding
in
any
other
court
except
that
one.
then,
there
is
a
trial
on
the
merits.
and
as
a
result
of
that
trial,
the
first
decision
has
to
do
with
the
question
of
fault.
if
the
shipowner
is
found
not
to
admit
its
fault,
then
his
security
is
returned
to
him
and
the
matter
is
finished.
if
however,
it
is
claimed
that
it's
found
that
he
is
at
fault,
then,
the
fund
in
the
hands
of
the
court
distributed
among
the
claimants.
now,
your
honors
can
see
that
this
is
not
like
an
ordinary
judicial
proceeding.
it's
one
that
starts
backwards.
it's
one
which
is
started
by
a
person
who
imagines
himself
to
be
a
defendant.
he
initiates
the
litigation
by
filing
this
petition.
and
so,
judge
benedict,
the
leading
writer
on
this
subject,
describes
it
as
a
special
proceeding
sui
generis
and
indeed,
it
is.
his
purpose
was
to
raise
the
question
of
the
liability
of
the
shipowner,
to
bring
into
that
court
all
claimants
against
the
ship,
to
restrict
the
liability
to
the
value
of
the
ship
if
he
was
liable
at
all,
and
--
and
to
distribute
the
assets.
and
in
further
--
furtherance
of
that
purpose,
for
over
a
century,
this
court
has
given
a
broad
and
equitable
construction
to
the
act.
it
has
described
it
as
a
useful
but
drastic
measure,
a
measure
which
in
the
language
of
chief
justice
taft
brings
in
against
their
will
all
the
claimants
and
prevents
them
from
establishing
their
claims
in
any
other
court.
it's
a
very
drastic
proceeding,
but
it's
a
useful
one
and
for
its
purposes,
it
has
been
generously
construed.
but
in
all
the
years
of
the
existence
of
this
statute,
106
years,
the
last
third
of
march,
not
$1
has
ever
been
recovered
by
anybody
in
any
court
of
the
united
states
against
a
claimant
in
the
limitation
proceeding,
not
$1.
we
will
have
the
occasion
later
on
to
examine
in
it
into
that
and
i
believe
that
you'll
find
that
that
is
the
case.
mr.
dean
acheson
well,
it's
because
in
most
of
the
cases,
they
held
that
they
could
not
sue.
but
in
those
where
they
did
permit
someone
to
be
brought
in,
they
found
that
the
liability
was
otherwise.
so
that
what
i
am
saying
rather,
startling
way
in
--
in
part
to
startle
my
learned
friend
on
my
right
here
is
that
in
all
the
history
of
the
united
states,
no
one
has
ever
succeeded
in
recovering
a
dollar
in
this
proceeding.
now,
if
we
turn
from
limitation
of
liability
to
rule
56,
you'll
see
that
this
is
a
wholly
different
kind
of
a
proceeding.
rule
56
was
thought
by
the
other
respondents
in
this
suit
and
by
the
two
lower
courts
to
be
the
source
of
authority
if
there
was
any
authority
for
any
proceeding
against
the
british
maritime
commission.
it
turned
on
the
construction
of
that
rule,
the
united
states
thinks
not.
the
united
states
thinks
this
could
be
done
regardless
of
the
rule,
but
both
the
lower
courts
and
the
other
respondents
believe
the
rule
to
be
detached
though.
now,
rule
56
came
about
as
a
result
of
decision
of
judge
addison
brown
in
1883
in
the
case
of
the
hudson,
and
judge
brown's
decision
has
came
about
by
reason
of
a
decision
of
this
court
in
the
atlas
in
1876.
now,
what
this
court
decided
in
the
atlas
was
that
contrary
to
the
law
of
england,
that
if
a
person
was
libeled,
if
the
shipowner
was
libeled
and
found
at
fault,
even
though
it
was
found
only
partly
at
fault,
the
libelants
could
recover
from
that
shipowner
the
full
amount
of
the
damages,
and
the
shipowner
was
then
left
to
pursue
contribution
from
his
joint
tortfeasor
or
feasors.
that
became
the
law
of
united
states
because
your
honors
said
it
was
and
it
is
different
from
the
law
england.
as
a
result
of
that,
judge
brown
said,
“very
well,
if
this
is
the
law,
therefore,
if
a
defendant
if
in
a
libel
proceeding,
the
shipowner
who
is
defended,
if
he
claims
that
another
ship
was
equally
at
fault,”
judge
brown
said,
“i
will
issue
an
auxiliary
writ
and
bring
him
in
as
a
defendant
into
this
proceeding,
so
that
he
may
share
the
burden
of
the
defense
and
pay
the
damages
if
damages
there
be.”
and
that's
was
rule
56
is.
and
as
it
was
originally
enacted,
it
was
a
rule
solely
having
to
do
with
collision
cases
later
on.it
came
to
other
--
other
cases
of
injury
too,
but
the
original
rule
is
very
simple
although
the
language
bears
out
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
description
a
moment
ago
in
some
statutes
which
are
not
wholly
illiterate.
on
page
15,
the
statute
reads
as
follows.
“in
a
suit
for
damage
by
collision,”
now
later
on,
it
was
extended
beyond
that.
“if
the
claimant
of
any
vessel
proceeded
against
or
any
respondent
proceeded
against
in
personam
shall,
by
petition,
are
now
presented
before
at
the
time
of
answering
the
libel
or
within
such
further
time
as
the
court
may
allow
and
containing
a
suitable
allegation
shall
enfold
on
negligence
in
any
other
vessel
contributing
to
the
same
collision
and
the
particulars
thereof,
and
that
such
other
vessel
or
any
other
party
ought
to
be
proceeded
against
in
the
same
suit
for
such
damage.”
now,
we
go
back
to
the
word.
“if
the
claimant
show
--
shall,
in
a
play,
that
process
be
issued
against
such
vessel
or
party
to
that
end,
such
process
may
be
issued.”
now,
what
that
meant
is
what
i
said
a
moment
ago,
that
if
a
defendant,
somebody
who
is
proceeded
against,
believes
that
somebody
else
ought
to
be
proceeded
against
as
well,
he
may
issue,
of
course,
to
have
issue
an
auxiliary
writ
to
bring
in
that
other
shipowner
as
a
defendant.
now,
your
honors
will
see
that
this
rule
is
talking
and
applicable
to
libel
proceedings.
it
talks
all
the
way
through
the
rule
of
the
libel.
it
says,
“at
the
time
when
the
rule
is
to
be
invoked,
is
before
or
at
the
time
of
answering
the
libel.
it's
invoked
by
a
defendant
who
is
caused
on
the
court
upon
to
answer
something.
after
service,
there
must
be
personal
service
upon
the
third
party
to
be
brought
in.
after
service,
such
suit
shall
proceed
as
if
such
vessel
or
person
had
been
originally
proceeded
against.
now,
that's
a
libel
action.
that's
where
you
originally
proceed
against
them.
and
when
brought
in,
this
third
party
shall
do
what?
the
first
thing
he
shall
do
is
to
answer
the
libel.
rule
56
is
a
rule
which
is
applicable
to
libel
proceedings
and
it's
made
so
by
its
language
and
it's
also
made
so
by
the
inherent
nature
of
the
two
proceedings.
it
is
wholly
irrelevant
to
a
limitation
of
liability
proceedings
what
rights
claimants
may
have
in
to
say.
the
whole
question
of
the
--
of
the
shipowners,
the
petitioning
shipowner's
liability
can
be
settled.
the
whole
fund
in
the
hands
of
the
court
can
be
distributed
without
being
destructed
in
any
way
by
the
claims
of
claimants
against
one
another.
mr.
dean
acheson
if
--
if
the
united
states
had
a
claim
against
the
british
transport
commission,
it
can
sue
the
british
transport
commission
wherever
it
can
sue
the
british
transport
commission.
but
the
whole
point
of
my
argument
is
that
coming
in
as
a
claimant
does
not
subject
oneself
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
for
purpose
of
service
as
a
--
of
a
cross-libel.
now,
the
united
states
as
cross-libel
is
not
before
your
honors
at
this
time.
that
is
pending
in
the
district
court.
what
is
before
your
honors
is
an
attempt
by
other
claimants
to
make
a
defendant
out
of
the
british
transport
commission.
but
to
answer
your
question,
mr.
justice
harlan,
coming
in
as
a
claimant
does
not
give
that
personal
appearance
in
the
jurisdiction
which
will
warrant
service
upon
the
practice
of
a
cross-libel.
mr.
dean
acheson
no,
sir.
the
court
would
not
have
any
jurisdiction
because
the
commission
is
a
british
corporation
in
england
and
can
of
course
be
sued
in
england.
mr.
dean
acheson
well,
its
position,
your
honor,
would
have
to
be
on
that.
it
would
have
had
to
sue
the
united
states
either
in
libel
in
the
united
states
or
wait
until
the
haiti
victory
or
some
other
ship
owned
by
the
united
states
went
into
a
british
harbor
and
then
attach
it
and
sue
it
in
england.
mr.
dean
acheson
not
at
all.
mr.
dean
acheson
not
at
all,
sir,
not
at
all.
if
it
were
an
american
corporation,
resident
in
the
united
states,
your
honor,
it
would
be
bound
by
the
injunction
so
that
it
could
not
sue
in
any
other
court.
but
if
it
were
in
england
and
not
present
and
not
subject
to
the
injunction
of
the
norfolk
court,
then
of
course
it
could
proceed
where
it
wish
to
proceed
it
and
could
get
service.
mr.
dean
acheson
that
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
dean
acheson
that
is
quite
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
dean
acheson
if
--
if
the
british
corporation
came
into
the
united
states
and
filed
a
direct
libel,
then,
it
would
be
subject
to
a
cross-libel,
no
question
about
that.
mr.
dean
acheson
they
are
different
in
this
respect,
in
this
respect
only,
mr.
justice
black.
the
question
of
fault
is
before
the
court
in
the
limitation
proceeding
as
it
would
be
in
a
libel
proceeding
and
that
issue
is
fully
decided,
have
now
result
of
the
decision
as
res
judicata,
that
everyone
is
bound
by
the
finding.
mr.
dean
acheson
now
--
mr.
dean
acheson
that
is
quite
correct,
your
honor.
it
would.
mr.
dean
acheson
now,
the
other
--
the
difference
is
that
if
this
were
a
libel
and
cross-libel,
then
claims
against
the
haiti
victory
could
come
before
the
court,
had
to
be
decided.
but
those
claims
cannot
come
before
the
court
in
a
limitation
proceeding
which
was
restricted
solely
to
the
question
of
the
liability
and
the
limitation
of
a
liability
of
the
petition.
mr.
dean
acheson
yes,
sir,
they
--
the
--
in
the
limitation
proceeding,
they
determined
the
question
of
fault,
everybody's
fault
that
is
determined.
furthermore,
so
far
as
the
united
states
is
concern,
if
it
is
found
not
at
fault,
then
there
is
no
further
proceeding
--
mr.
dean
acheson
then,
the
fund,
the
value
of
the
ship
plus
the
freight,
if
there
were
any
freight
would
be
divided
among
the
claimants.
mr.
dean
acheson
the
difference
is
whose
liability
is
being
adjudicated.
and
in
the
limitation
proceeding,
the
--
that
liability
is
being
adjudicated
which
is
petitioned
to
be
adjudicated,
i.e.,
in
that
of
the
united
states.
in
the
libel
and
cross-libel
then
the
liability
of
both
parties
that
is
the
damages
which
they
pay
is
adjudicated.
mr.
dean
acheson
well,
we
--
we
believe
that
is
why
--
mr.
dean
acheson
i
don't
believe
putting
it
in
words
has
any
particularly
sectors
of
that.
mr.
dean
acheson
that's
quite
right
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
dean
acheson
the
form
of
incantation
would
not
have
the
--
mr.
dean
acheson
no,
your
honor.
they
--
they
are
--
clearly,
they
are
tearing
for
the
sole
thing
which
the
statute
and
rules
says
is
involved
in
the
proceeding.
that
is,
is
the
united
states
liable
at
all?
and
if
so,
who
gets
what
share
of
the
fund
in
the
hands
of
the
court?
mr.
dean
acheson
that
was
found
by
the
trial
court
and
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
dean
acheson
no,
mr.
justice
brennan.
that
is
res
adjudicata.
that
--
that
issue
is
closed.
mr.
dean
acheson
anywhere,
anytime
at
any
court.
mr.
dean
acheson
among
all
parties
who
appeared
in
that
proceeding.
they
are
bound
by
the
judgement
of
the
two
lower
courts,
which
this
court
would
now
review,
but
the
united
states
was
not
at
fault,
the
duke
or
york
was
at
fault.
that
is
said.
mr.
dean
acheson
it's
proceeding
to
prove
their
claims,
get
a
judgement
for
their
claims.
mr.
dean
acheson
that's
all
that
is
left,
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
and
let
me
speak
for
a
moment
about
that.
mr.
dean
acheson
all
right,
that
--
that
is
a
very
good
question,
your
honor.
i
want
to
wish
i
was
ready
to
address
myself,
because
under
the
government's
claim,
i
think
it
looks
as
though
the
duke
of
york
would
have
no
recourse
to
any
limitation.
the
government
says,
“probably
it
would,
but
it
doesn't
know.”
and
the
reason
it
doesn't
know
is
that
if
this
trial
takes
place
in
the
united
states,
there
was
an
amendment
to
the
limitation
of
liability
statute
in
1946.
and
that
amendment
said
that
“a
proceeding
for
limitation
must
be
started
within
six
months
of
the
time
when
a
shipowner
is
notified
of
the
claim.”
now,
you
can
see
it
what's
about
that,
what
questions
that
raise.
the
question
it
raised
is,
does
this
apply
to
a
limitation
as
a
defense
or
only
as
an
aggressive
act?
and
on
that,
you
will
not
be
surprised
to
hear
that
the
courts
are
evenly
divided,
absolutely
evenly
on
that
question.
half
of
them
say,
“the
six
months
limitation
applies
to
everything.
you
cannot
plead
limitation
as
a
defense.
you
cannot
certify
petitioner.”
the
other
half
of
the
courts
say,
“it
does
not
apply
to
pleading
as
a
defense.
it
only
applies
to
taking
the
affirmative
step.”
and
the
only
court
of
appeals
which
has
expressed
itself
on
this
has
said
that
it
applies
to
both
defense
and
the
other.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit,
in
overruling
the
district
court,
i
was
following
out
some
of
the
thoughts
which
are
in
the
minds
of
your
honors.
and
it
felt
two
--
there
were
two
great
reasons
why
this
should
be
done,
why
should
it
reverse
the
district
court.
one
was
because
it
said,
“there
would
be
grave
hardships
imposed
upon
the
claimants
if
it
did
not
do
so,”
and
the
other
was,
“because
equitable
principles
required
it
to
do
so.”
now,
these
hardships
are
three
in
number
as
stated
by
the
court.
they
are,
that
if
the
court
of
norfolk
doesn't
decide
this,
there
will
have
to
be
another
proceeding.
second
one
is
this
other
proceeding
will
be
at
great
expense.
the
third
one
is
that
it
will
be
at
a
time
when
perhaps
much
of
the
evidence
necessary
to
support
their
claims
would
have
been
lost.
now,
when
we
examined
these,
we
--
we
found
it
a
rather
confusing
situation.
there
must
be
another
proceeding
in
any
event.
this
is
a
british
corporation.
whatever
judgements
it
gets
in
norfolk,
these
judgements
are
collected
in
england.
and
when
a
claimant
goes
to
england
to
collect,
the
first
thing
that
the
british
transport
corporation
will
plead
is
the
british
statute
of
limitation,
not
at
that
time,
but
limitation
of
liability.
now,
the
british
limitation
of
liability
statute
is
different
from
ours.
it's
more
favorable
to
shipowners
than
ours.
it's
one
to
which
this
corporation
is
entitled
in
an
english
court
and
an
english
court
will
give
it
that
benefit.
so,
there
is
one
reason
of
why
they
must
be
--
mr.
dean
acheson
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
dean
acheson
well,
your
honor,
it
--
it
would
lose
this.
in
the
first
place,
there
are
104
people
involved
here
who
are
residents
of
the
continent
in
england
--
on
england.
so
far
as
hardship
for
them
is
concerned,
there's
certainly
far
or
less
hardship
to
litigating
where
you
live
than
in
litigating
across
the
atlantic.
so
far
as
lost
of
evidence
due
to
time
is
concerned,
they
presented
much
more
easily
and
much
more
quickly
and
with
less
chance
of
laws
in
an
english
court
that
over
here
in
norfolk
where
everybody
has
to
cross
the
ocean
to
do
it.
and
furthermore,
there's
another
great
loss
if
they
would
infer.
and
that
is
not
only
just
the
british
limitation
of
liabilities
statute
applied,
but
under
the
british
law,
it
has
two
contract
limitations
of
liability.
they
do
not
have
the
harter
act
provisions
in
this
country.
and
therefore,
when
contracts
of
affreightment
are
made
or
when
personal
passages
are
arranged,
what
the
degrees
of
liability
and
for
how
much
are
determined?
those
are
invalid
in
an
american
court.
they
are
not
invalid
in
an
english
court.
mr.
dean
acheson
yes,
sir.
mr.
dean
acheson
they
--
they
would
have
to
do
it
for
that
reason
and
for
another
reason.
and
the
other
reason
would
--
would
be
that
a
decision
in
the
norfolk
court
as
to
the
liability
of
the
amount
of
the
liability
of
the
british
transport
commission
to
various
claimants
would
not
be
res
judicata
in
england.
and
it
would
not
be
res
judicata
because,
the
english
courts
would
say
and
properly
say
that
at
the
time
that
the
british
transport
commission
appeared
in
the
united
states,
the
law
was
perfectly
obvious
to
anyone
who
is
not
perhaps
a
lawyer.
that
it
was
not
subjecting
itself
to
the
determination
of
its
own
liability.
it
is
not
doing
that
at
all.
the
--
the
rule
was
clear.
the
statute
was
clear.
the
unbroken
course
of
decisions
of
our
courts
have
--
had
been
in
that
direction.
and
as
i
say,
nobody
had
collected
a
cent
in
106
years.
therefore,
the
british
courts
would
say,
“our
national
did
not
enter
the
american
courts
for
the
purpose
of
having
its
liability,
if
any,
to
your
claimants
determined.
and
whatever
the
american
court
did
is
not
res
judicata.
and
we
will
relitigate
that
court
because
we
have
our
own
statute
of
limitation
of
liability.
we
have
our
own
contractual
reasons
for
liability,
and
--
and
we're
all
here
in
europe,
and
i
have
all
our
evidence
here.
and
therefore,
that
would
be
done.”
so,
that
--
mr.
dean
acheson
that's
what
i
meant.
mr.
dean
acheson
no.
they
--
they
would
say
that
the
decision
as
to
the
liability
of
the
british
transport
commission,
two
individual
claimants
was
not
res
judicata
at
all.
it
was
persuasive.
it
will
be
interesting.
it
could
be
introduced,
and
then
it
might
be
followed
by
the
court,
but
it
would
not
be
compelling
upon
the
court.
now,
that
may
be
very
clear
about
one
distinction.
it
is
res
judicata
as
to
who
is
at
fault.
that
point
would
not
be
relitigated.
that
was
clear,
that
--
mr.
dean
acheson
--
but
this
court
would
--
would
accept
that,
but
it
would
not
say,
“we
have
a
judgment
which
is
a
binding
judgment
on
our
case,
because
the
norfolk
--
mr.
dean
acheson
no,
the
english
--
mr.
dean
acheson
the
english
law,
your
honor,
on
res
judicata
is
that
their
courts
will
determine,
whether,
in
appearing
in
a
proceeding
in
a
foreign
court,
the
english
national
appearing,
was
put
on
notice
by
the
local
law
that
he
was
subjecting
himself
to
the
judgment,
which
is
now
produced
against
him.
mr.
dean
acheson
no,
if
--
if
you
mean
they
would
accept
your
decision
in
this
court
after
this
--
mr.
dean
acheson
no,
they
would
not
accept
the
judgment
as
to
the
amount.
and
i
think
even
if
this
court
should
decide
that
a
suit
did
lie,
they
would
say,
“from
now
on,
this
is
the
law
of
the
united
states,
it's
perfectly
clear.
anyone
who
goes
in
now
into
a
limitation
of
liability
is
on
notice.”
mr.
dean
acheson
i
doubt
they
would
but
not
now,
not
--
not
in
the
presence
of
it.
now
that
we
come
to
the
second
question,
which
the
court
--
mr.
dean
acheson
that
--
that's
what
the
--
mr.
dean
acheson
that
would
mean,
but
the
monition
--
mr.
dean
acheson
and
that's
what
it
says
and
those
were
precise
words,
your
honor.
that
it
says,
“you
are
summoned
to
appear
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
the
city
of
norfolk,
et
cetera,
to
litigate
or
to
object
to,
if
you
wish,
the
question
of
the
liability
of
the
united
states
and
the
amount
of
your
claim
against
the
united
states.
now,
that's
all
that
it
says
in
this
monition.
and
that's
all
that
the
statute
says
at
the
same
road.
mr.
dean
acheson
i'm
--
i'm
making
a
conjectural
argument,
your
honor,
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
but
there
are
many
british
decisions
on
the
principle
which
i'm
arguing.
and
that
principle
is,
did
the
person
who
is
now
faced
with
the
judgment,
have
noticed
when
he
went
into
the
foreign
court
that
this
issue
would
be
litigated?
and
if
he
did,
the
courts
of
england
say,
“well,
you've
got
to
abide
by
it,”
but
if
it
was
a
surprise
to
him
and
this
happens
very
often
in
the
english
courts
between
the
continent
in
england,
then
they
will
retry
the
issue.
mr.
dean
acheson
i
beg
you
pardon.
mr.
dean
acheson
there
are
english
cases
of
that
kind,
not
on
this
statute,
justice
whittaker,
but
there
are
of
the
kind
that
i
would
say
and
they're
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
dean
acheson
yes,
it
is.
mr.
dean
acheson
yes
i
am
your
honor,
yes.
you're
quire
right.
now,
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
found
another
reason
for
overruling
the
district
court,
reversing
the
district
court.
and
--
and
this
was
on
the
analogy
of
equity
receivership
proceedings,
particularly,
the
case
of
alexander
versus
hillman.
now,
it
would
always
seem
to
me
that
the
most
confusing
mental
exercise,
which
one
can
indulge,
is
analogy.
that
always
makes
these
people
up,
because
they
get
the
wrong
analogy.
instead
of
thinking
about
the
problem,
they're
thinking
about
some
other
problem.
and
here,
the
court
got
on
to
equity
receivership.
that
it
misunderstood
what
went
on
in
equity
receivership.
and
then,
applying
an
analogy
wrongly,
it
came
to
a
wrong
conclusion.
the
case
of
alexander
versus
hillman
is
one
of
insolvent
to
state,
an
out-of-state
creditor
appearing,
to
make
a
demand
against
the
estate,
but
withholding
from
the
estate,
property
of
the
insolvent
in
the
hands
of
the
claimant.
and
this
court
said,
“you
can't
do
that.
if
you
come
in
here
to
litigate
your
relations
with
this
estate,
we're
going
to
litigate
them
all.
we're
not
going
to
just
litigate
to
what
you
want
to
litigate.”
and
the
court
said,
“on
behalf
of
creditors
and
stockholders,
the
receivers
reasonably
may
insist,
that
before
taking
part,
respondents
made
by
the
receivership
court
to
be
required
to
make
restitution.”
well
that's
clear.
the
distribution,
it
went
on,
may
not
be
made
without
decision
on
the
counterclaims.
nothing
is
more
clearly
apart
of
the
subject
matter
of
the
main
suit,
than
recovery
of
all
but
to
the
res
belongs.
now,
that's
perfectly
clear.
but
in
this
case,
the
main
suit
is
the
liability
of
the
united
states.
the
res
in
the
hands
of
the
court,
if
it
were
not
for
the
sovereignty
of
the
united
states,
would
be
the
value
of
the
haiti
victory.
it's
not
only
possible
but
it's
necessary
to
determine
the
main
suit
and
to
distribute
that
res
without
confusing
this,
by
side
issues
brought
in
by
claims
of
claimants
with
one
another.
mr.
dean
acheson
that
--
these
are
different
questions.
mr.
dean
acheson
they
stem
really
from
the
same
main
consideration,
which
is,
did
the
british
transport
commission
would
come
present
in
the
united
states
for
all
the
litigation,
which
might
grow
up
of
this
collision?
that's
the
basic
fact,
but
the
rights
of
claimants
against
one
another
are
somewhat
different
from
the
rights
of
the
petitioner
against
the
claimants,
not
very,
but
someone.
mr.
dean
acheson
yes,
i
--
i
wouldn't
admit
that
premise,
but
i
would
--
mr.
dean
acheson
--
enthusiast
to
digress
the
conclusion.[laughter]
mr.
dean
acheson
well,
i
--
i
think
there
is
some
--
some
distinction,
yes,
justice
harlan.
now,
the
--
the
foreign
law
looks
at
the
matter
the
way
we
--
we
look
at
it.
can
the
law
of
all
the,
well,
western
maritime
countries,
canada,
england,
france,
italy,
spain,
belgium,
the
netherlands,
all
the
scandinavian
countries.
claimants
in
an
admiralty
proceeding
cannot
litigate
issues
inter
se.
now,
the
government
says,
“well,
do
you
--
you
don't
really
frankly
state
what
the
foreign
law
is,
because
they
say
in
the
foreign
law,”
that
is
the
continent,
this
isn't
true
of
canada,
“but
to
some
extent,
in
england
and
on
the
continent,
liability
of
the
shipowner
must
be
determined
before
you
begin
the
question
of
how
much
shall
be
given
to
what
claimants.”
and
the
limitation
proceeding
which
is
the
second
one,
does
not
have
questions
of
liability
involved
in
it.
and
so,
the
united
states
has
well,
of
course
--
of
course,
there
are
claims
between
claimants
here,
because
all
of
that
was
settled
in
the
original
proceeding.
well,
what
we
say
is
you
misunderstood
it.
we
--
we
are
talking
about
the
whole
business
as
one
proceeding.
surely,
they
have
different
docket
numbers.
they
have
different
title
numbers.
but
the
foreign
courts
decide
the
question
of
liability
first
just
as
we
do
in
the
limitation
proceeding.
and
when
we
say,
“is
it
none
of
these
countries
at
anytime
in
admiralty
make
claimants
claim
against
one
another?”
they
simple
aren't
permitted
to
do
so.
and
in
fact,
in
only
two
countries
may
a
shipowner
proceeded
against,
even
put
out
a
settlor
against
the
claimant,
and
that
is
in
the
netherlands
and
that
is
in
france.
now,
your
honors
--
mr.
dean
acheson
that's
by
accepted
procedure,
not
by
a
statute.
it's
just
never
has
occurred
under
the
civil
law
of
france
and
the
netherlands
are
deeply
criticized,
your
honor,
for
permitting
this.
now,
against
this
record
of
a
100
years,
let
me
briefly
speak
of
some
cases
which
the
government
brings
up.
the
government's
argument
is
that
admiralty
is
so
flexible
that
whatever
the
rules
say,
this
court
would
be
permitting.
in
fact,
the
government
regards
words
as
so
genially
compliant
as
to
warrant
the
most
remarkable
results
from
using
them.
on
page
15
of
their
brief,
they
have
this
sentence.
it
says,
“allowance
of
cross-claims
between
co-parties
has
been
a
characteristic
feature
of
the
limitation
concourse
since
its
inception.”
now,
that
would
certainly
seem
to
carry
to
the
unsuspected
mind
that
this
had
been
a
pretty
characteristic
proceeding
for,
well,
over
a
century.
curious,
if
that
is
so,
that
both
the
courts
below
thought
it
was
a
case
of
first
impression
and
that
the
co-respondents
in
this
case
also
think
it's
a
case
of
first
impression.
however,
one
finds
on
reading
further
in
the
government's
brief
that
they
don't
mean
what
they
say
at
all,
but
they
do
mean,
is
that
in
libel
actions,
where
a
shipowner
libels
another
shipowner,
and
that
shipowner
in
turn
libels
back,
that
in
those
proceedings,
each
shipowner
is
entitled
to
limitation.
well,
of
course,
he
is.
nobody
has
ever
suggested
that
he
wouldn't
be.
limitation
is
a
defense,
whether
it
be
a
libel
or
a
cross-libel
or
however
it
is,
maybe,
you're
entitled
to
that
defense.
but
it
certainly
is
not
the
case.
in
fact,
the
exact
composite
is
the
case,
that
allowance
of
cross-claims
between
co-parties
has
been
the
characteristic
feature
of
limitation
procedures
in
section.
nothing
could
be
informed
erroneous
than
that.
and
the
case
is
which
it
gathers
together,
asserting
that
admiralty
must
be
very
broadly
and
broadly
administered.
our
cases,
which
have
nothing
to
do,
were
the
problem
before
us.
for
instance,
in
the
scotland,
what
was
the
scotland
about?
that
was
a
case,
which
said
the
foreign
shipowners
are
entitled
for
limitation
proceedings
just
as
much
as
american
shipowners,
well,
of
course.
the
north
star
is
a
case,
which
holds,
that
where
two
ships
are
equally
liable,
each
ship
is
entitled
to
limitation.
well,
surely,
it
is.
the
epsilon,
which
they
cited,
it's
a
case,
which
says,
“limitation
is
available
for
personal
injuries
as
well
as
injuries
to
the
ship.”
the
adah,
a
great
deal
of
talk
about
the
adah
in
the
governments
brief,
that
is
authority
for
the
proposition
which
i've
been
insisting
upon
here,
which
is,
that
all
parties
to
the
limitation
proceeding
avowed
from
the
question
of
fault,
just
as
the
commission
is
bound
here.
and
so,
we
go
along,
finding
no
cases,
which
support
the
government's
argument
until
we
come
to
two,
that
they
think
there
are
two,
the
city
of
boston
and
the
eastern
dredging
case.
now,
these
are
not
two
cases,
they're
one
case.
they're
in
1909.
they
were
both
in
the
same
district
court
in
massachusetts.
they
did
not
grow
out.
it
was
very
earthshaking,
a
maritime
disaster.
the
ferryboat,
in
the
city
of
boston,
and
boston
harbor
run
into
a
scow
and
did
not
hurt
the
scow
at
all.
it
didn't
hurt
itself
much,
but
that
mr.
and
mrs.
davenport
fell
overboard
and
they
were
rescued,
a
good
deal
of
outrage
by
the
performance,
but
not
much
the
worst
way.
both
shipowners
started
limitation
proceedings
in
the
same
court
in
boston.
the
ferry
company
went
into
the
dredging
company's
limitation
preceding
and
filed
a
claim,
the
sum
of
$4000
just
to
call
us
to
fix
up
the
ferryboat.
mr.
and
mrs.
davenport
went
into
the
ferryboat's
proceeding
but
not
into
the
scow,
and
they
claimed
$3500
for
their
experience
in
the
water.
judge
dodge
thought
this
over
and
the
problem
was,
of
course,
how
did
both
ships
we're
held
equally
at
fault?
how
he
get
the
davenport
damages
equally
divided
when
they
were
claiming
in
one
preceding
but
not
in
the
other.
so,
first
of
all,
he
made
a
mistake.
the
report
on
page
171
of
182
f.,
he
held
that
it
to
bring
the
scow
into
the
ferryboat's
proceeding.
this
is
cited
by
the
united
states.
however,
on
page
179,
he
did
change
his
mind
on
that,
and
thought
that
wasn't
a
very
good
procedure.
and
the
best
thing
to
do
is
to
allow
the
ferry
company,
which
was
in
the
scow
company's
proceeding
to
put
one-half
of
the
davenport's
judgment
onto
its
claim,
which
they
did.
so,
you
see,
nobody
was
brought
in
under
rule
56
and
made
pay
anything.
the
same
thing
turns
out
to
be
the
case
of
--
of
that
long
litigation
between
the
united
states
and
the
steel
products
company,
which
grew
out
of
the
accident
on
the
pacific
maneuvers
of
1920.
there,
the
steel
inventor,
a
ship
of
the
steel
products
company,
had
got
into
the
middle
of
the
destroyer
formation
on
night,
and
ran
into
and
sank
the
uss
destroyer
woolsey,
making
a
total
loss
of
it.
there
were
several
hearings
that
were
all
cited
here,
except
the
last
part,
which
should
be.
the
first
point
was
two
cargo
owners,
owners
of
cargo
on
the
steel
inventor,
who
were
prevented
by
the
harter
act
from
suing
the
steel
inventor
went
into
the
limitation
of
liability
proceedings
started
by
the
steel
inventor,
and
said,
“we
cannot
sue
the
steel
inventor.
we
can't
sue
the
united
states
because
it's
sovereign.
but
if
the
steel
inventor
is
held
at
fault,
it's
going
to
be
a
big
fund
in
the
court
and
we
want
our
share
of
it."
and
after
some
discussion,
it
was
decided
very
well,
“you
can
file
your
claims
against
this
fund,
not
against
united
states,
it's
the
sovereign.
but
before
the
united
states
gets
the
money,
maybe
you
can
get
hold
of
some
of
it.”
this
is
said
to
be
a
cross-claim.
it
wasn't
a
cross-claim.
it
was
a
claim
on
the
fund
in
the
hands
of
the
court.
but
furthermore,
nothing
came
of
it,
because
it
was
decided
that
the
woolsey
was
at
fault
and
not
the
steel
inventors,
so
the
whole
litigation
evaporated.
then,
there
was
another
part
of
the
litigation,
which
is
much
more
interesting,
and
that
was
that
the
united
states
came
into
the
steel
inventor's
proceeding
with
a
claim,
whereupon,
the
steel
products
company,
filed
a
cross-libel
against
the
united
states.
and
judge
hough
said,
“you
can't
do
that.
that
can't
be
done.”
because
he
says,
“this
does
raise
the
question
of
an
affirmative
claim
against
the
claimant
in
a
limitation
proceeding.”
and
he
should
--
the
argument
here
is
that
every
claimant
who
answers
and
opposes
limitation
is
a
libel,
and
therefore,
is
subject
to
a
cross-libel.
but
he
says,
“that
isn't
so.”
“a
libel,”
said
judge
hough,
“is
a
statement
of
claim
on
which
process
may
issue.
no
process
issues
on
an
answer.”
“a
libel
must
state
damage.”
but
he
claimed,
“it
does
not
have
to
state
any
damage.
all
that
it
states
is
that
a
claim
is
put
in.”
three
a
libel
is
the
beginning
of
an
action.
the
answer
is
not
the
beginning
of
an
action.
now,
he
says,
“surely,
this
is
technical.”
and
then,
this
sentence,
which
i
--
i
venture
to
quote
to
the
court,
“these
technicalities
are
not
unimportant.
for
while
there
could
be
a
theory
of
law
without
any
applied
technique,
there
can
be
no
application
thereof
without
some
technique,
which
lies
at
the
very
foundation
of
legal
application.”
and
so,
he
said,
“there
cannot
be
a
cross-libel
in
a
limitation
proceeding.”
now,
counsel
criticized
this
opinion,
and
i
think
--
mr.
dean
acheson
--
they
do
it
rather
harshly
because
--
mr.
dean
acheson
this
is
the
steel
inventor.
mr.
dean
acheson
no.
that
is
the
recent
one,
your
honor.
that
was
in
1921.
the
recent
one
is
the
moore-mccormack
decision.
mr.
dean
acheson
judge
hough
was
agreeing
with
the
government.
the
government
was
presenting
to
judge
hough
the
argument,
which
i
am
now
presenting
to
you.
and
at
that
time,
there
were
no
authorities
or
clearly,
the
government
would've
found
them.
but
they
thought
--
mr.
dean
acheson
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
dean
acheson
practice?
mr.
dean
acheson
yes.
mr.
dean
acheson
very
considerable
authority,
your
honor,
very
great
authority.
but
the
government
says,
“judge
hough
was
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals,”
and
that
we,
in
our
brief,
did
not
mention
that,
and
it
points
out
how
unfortunate
that
was.
it
would
indeed
have
been
unfortunate
if
it
had
occurred.
but
unfortunately,
there
is
still
another
decision,
which
the
government
didn't
come
across.
and
in
that
decision,
the
court
of
appeals
found
as
i
say,
that
the
woolsey
was
solely
at
fault.
therefore,
it
ends
up
its
--
it's
true.
it
disagreed
with
judge
hough.
it
said,
“well,
we
want
him
to
decide
on
this
one.”
but
it
ends
up
its
decision
by
saying,
“in
view
of
our
decision
as
to
liability,
all
other
questions
raised
on
this
appeal
are
moot.”
so,
this
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
was
saved
from
error
by
mootness
on
that
point.
the
court
of
appeals
is,
i
hope,
going
to
be
saved
from
error
again
by
this
court.
in
moore-mccormack,
it
decided
that
the
claimants
could
file
claims
against
a
co-claimant.
that,
however,
was
an
interlocutory
decision.
the
case
is
now
at
trial.
and
so,
we
believe
that
before
it
reaches
the
point
where
the
court
may
i
have
to
commit
error,
your
honors
will
have
saved
them
from
doing
so.
mr.
dean
acheson
that's
--
mr.
dean
acheson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dean
acheson
it's
19
--
mr.
dean
acheson
1925
american
maritime
--
mr.
dean
acheson
it's
not.
there
is
one
other
decision,
which
they
cite,
which
had
the
same
fate,
the
clio
and
the
springhill.
there,
there
was
an
intervention
permitted
under
rule
56,
not
an
intervention,
but
of
bringing
in
of
the
shipowner
into
another
shipowner's
limitation
of
liability
proceeding.
but
there
again,
the
fault
was
found
on
the
ship
who
brought
in
the
third
party,
and
therefore,
that
again
evaporated.
so,
i
end
up
as
i
begin,
your
honors,
by
saying
that
in
the
whole
106
years
of
practice
under
this
statute,
there
has
not
been
one
single
case
where
a
dollar
has
been
recovered
from
the
claimant
in
the
limitation
of
liability
proceeding.
mr.
dean
acheson
mr.
chief
justice,
am
i
correct
that
i
have
five
minutes?
mr.
dean
acheson
pardon,
a
white
light
there.
mr.
dean
acheson
that
should
be.
if
the
court
please.
first
of
all,
may
i
straighten
out
a
few
matters.
in
regard
to
the
discussion
that
we
had
a
moment
ago
about
my
statement
that
in
a
106
years,
no
dollar
had
been
collected.
one
of
my
distinguished
opponents
thought
that
i
lifted
that
from
judge
hand.
there
isn't
--
find
a
man
to
lift
something
from
that
one
was
lifting.
but
i
was
making
his
statement
on
my
own
authority
and
i
was
saying
that
having
looked
--
i
think
in
every
case
that's
been
decided,
there
is
not
one
where
a
dollar
has
been
collected.
and
if
we
just
take
this
reason
or
one
that
mr.
doub
was
talking
about,
you'll
see
why
he
said
that.
these
--
these
ideas
and
decision
that
he's
talking
about
are
interlocutory
orders
and
in
this
case
that
the
woolsey,
it
is
quite
true,
there
was
an
interlocutory
order
that
some
claimants
might
come
in
and
file
a
claim
against
any
proceeds
which
remained
in
the
hands
in
the
court.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
there
were
no
proceeds
in
the
hands
of
the
court
because
the
steel
inventor
was
declared
innocent,
there
was
no
fault
there.
therefore,
in
its
proceeding
the
--
there
was
no
fund
to
distribute.
the
united
states
destroyer,
woolsey,
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
pacific
ocean
and
since
it
did
not
carry
freight,
the
fund
that
could
have
been
distributed
on
account
of
the
woolsey
was
zero.
and
therefore,
although,
united
states
was
found
at
fault
and
although
people
could
have
claimed,
if
there
had
been
anything
to
claim,
nobody
did.
now,
the
same
thing
is
true
of
these
other
cases.
now,
one
other
matter
to
straighten
up,
which
at
least
confused
me
and
the
responses
to
some
questions
asked
by
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
got
the
idea
that
the
response
was
made
that
if
the
british
transport
commission
had
not
come
to
the
united
states,
but
it
remained
in
england
when
this
indication
proceeding
was
started,
the
results
of
the
courts
decision
would
have
been
res
judicata
against
it.
now,
that
of
course
cannot
be
settled,
the
--
no
one
can
be
bound
by
the
judgment
of
the
court,
it
was
not
in
court
in
present.
and
if
this,
your
honors,
raises
the
whole
basis
of
--
of
this
argument
that
the
purpose
of
limitation
procedures
is
to
bring
in
to
court
everybody
who
has
a
claim
against
a
limited
fund.
now,
so
far
as
the
american
citizens
are
concerned,
our
courts
can
enjoin
them.
they
can
say,
“you
must
come
in
here
or
be
defaulted,
and
you
cannot
go
into
any
other
court.”
but
our
courts
can't
control
people
who
are
not
in
the
united
states,
you
can't
default
somebody
who
isn't
in
your
court.
you
can't
enjoin
somebody
who
is
in
england.
and
therefore,
these
foreign
claimants,
after
they
induced
to
come
into
these
proceedings,
and
it's
highly
important
that
the
proceedings
should
be
of
such
a
nature
that
they
will
come
in.
now,
in
considering
whether
to
come
in,
if
a
claimant
is
going
to
find
himself,
defending
himself
against
all
other
claimants
in
the
suit
he
will
say,
“no,
i
think
i'll
just
wait.”
but
as
there
will
be
another
ship
that
will
come
to
england
before
long
and
i
will
file
a
suit
against
that
ship
and
attach
it
again
a
fund
in
court,
and
then
--
and
have
another
proceeding
in
england.
and
therefore,
the
whole
purpose
of
the
limitation
of
liability
statutes
would
be
defeated
that
you
would
not
have
succeeded
in
bringing
into
one
proceeding
all
the
claims
against
one
shipowner.
and
that's
why
it
is
so
important
to
do
one
thing
at
a
time
and
not
try
to
solve
all
the
issues
which
possibly
could
arise.
mr.
dean
acheson
it
wouldn't
--
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
in
the
argument
on
this
narrow
situation.
mr.
dean
acheson
the
difference
would
be,
your
honor,
that
if
both
ships
were
american
ships
or
if
the
british
were
present
in
the
united
states,
then
an
independent
suit
could
be
filed
against
that
shipowner.
once
that
libel
had
been
filed,
the
court
had
taken
jurisdiction,
the
proceedings
could
be
transferred
to
the
same
court
and
consolidate
that
the
whole
question
here
is
can
you
get
hold
of
the
person
who
is
sought
to
be
impleaded?
and
we
say
that
if
that
person
is
in
the
united
states,
two
american
ship
companies
in
new
york,
one
starts
a
limitation
proceeding.
if
the
other
one
is
at
fault,
he
will
start
an
independent
suit
against
the
other
one
and
then
consolidate
the
proceedings.
but
you
cannot
serve
them
merely
because
he
is
in
the
limitation
proceeding.
now,
this
becomes
important
in
regard
to
foreigners,
because
they
are
not
in
the
united
states
except
as
they
come
in
for
the
limited
purpose
of
the
limited
liability
proceeding.
mr.
dean
acheson
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
dean
acheson
have
it
consolidate
or
have
it
not
consolidate?
mr.
dean
acheson
it
does
not
mean
that
so
far
as
the
foreign
shipowner
is
concerned,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
dean
acheson
so
far
as
an
american
shipowner
is
concerned,
yes.
mr.
dean
acheson
you
--
you
have
acquired
jurisdiction
by
the
service
of
process.
now,
having
acquired
jurisdiction,
you
can
do
in
that
proceeding
what
you
do
in
any
proceeding,
transferred,
or
consolidated,
or
not.
if
you
cannot
acquire
jurisdiction,
you
cannot
do
it
by
serving
his
lawyer
in
the
limitation
proceeding.
one
other
thing
that
i
would
like
to
mention,
i
--
i
misstated
the
result
of
the
decision
in
the
moore-mccormack
case.
i
said
to
the
court
that
was
a
proceeding
in
which
a
co-claimant
had
allowed
--
allowed
to
implead
in
an
interlocutory
way
another
co-claimant.
that
is
not
correct.
i
was
in
error
there.
it
is
a
case
where
a
cross-libel
was
filed.
therefore,
that
case
is
like
the
one
which
is
pending
in
the
district
court
and
not
like
the
case
which
is
now
before
your
honor.
mr.
dean
acheson
yes,
your
honor,
it's
prejudiced.
first
of
all,
in
that
if
--
if
it
has
any
limitation
of
liability
rights,
they
are
those
under
the
american
statute
and
not
under
the
british
statute.
secondly,
all
its
defenses,
the
ticket
and
other
defenses
or
would
not
be
available
to
win
under
the
harter
act.
mr.
dean
acheson
would
not
be,
yes,
sir.
that's
why
mr.
dow
is
very
careful
to
tell
you
that
he
does
not
agree
that
those
--
that
american
law
would
not
be
imposed.
american
law
wouldn't
be
opposed
and
that's
of
course
why
they
wish
to
sue
here.
mr.
dean
acheson
that
is
quite
right.
yes,
your
honor.
the
english
law
is
drawn
among
in
favor
of
the
shipowner
than
the
american
law.
and
therefore,
that's
their
business.
it's
conducted
under
that
law.
mr.
dean
acheson
they
setup
their
--
mr.
dean
acheson
they
setup
their
contracts
as
defenses,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
dean
acheson
no,
i
--
i
mean
that
--
in
the
first
place,
mr.
justice
black,
those
judgments
would
not
be
res
judicata.
and
therefore,
the
whole
matter
would
be
tried
de
novo.
mr.
dean
acheson
that
--
that
is
true,
sir.
mr.
dean
acheson
that
--
that
is
true.
