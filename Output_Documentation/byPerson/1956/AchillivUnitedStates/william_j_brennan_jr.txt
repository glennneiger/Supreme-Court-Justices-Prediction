justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
atwood,
do
i
correctly
understand
the
government's
position
is
not
that
3616
in
terms
would
not
apply
to
this
offense.
but
rather
that
later
legislation
has
indicated
a
congressional
intention
to
supercede
the
purposes
of
prosecution
of
this
offense?
that
statute
with
the
felony
statute.
i
--
i
don't
--
do
you
understand
the
government
to
argue
that
in
terms
3616
would
not
apply
at
this
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think
that's
the
position
of
their
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
do?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
they
pay.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
perhaps,
i
should
have
ask
the
government
the
question
but
i
--
i
followed
your
argument.
i
thought
it
different
--
that
your
impression
is
different
from
mine
of
what
the
government
is
saying.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
we
have
nothing
else
in
the
way
of
legislation
or
history
or
anything
else
but
on
the
face
of
it,
it
would
not
apply.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
you
start,
mr.
rice,
would
you
tell
me
whether
we
have
nothing
but
3616
to
look
at?
would
it
or
would
it
not
on
its
face
cover
the
offense
charge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
looking
at
3616
without
anything
else.
that's
all
we
have.
would
it
on
its
face
cover
the
offense
charge
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
what
your
position
is.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
want
to
know
whether
it
would
or
wouldn't
on
its
face.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right.
now,
your
position
--
your
position
is
that
the
legislative
history
will
establish
that
return
as
used
there
did
not
include
income
tax
return,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it
there
were
number
of
convictions
then
under
it
or
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
say
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
number
of
these
cases,
i
think
you
told
us
before
recess
where
prosecuted
by
information
of
an
indictment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
with
this
new
position,
the
government
is
correct,
what's
the
government's
position
in
relation
to
people
prosecuted
by
and
large?
now,
it
shouldn't
have
been
prosecuted
at
all.
