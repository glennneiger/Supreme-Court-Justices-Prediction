what
could
they
talk
to
him
whether
to
proceed
there
for
a
felony

misdemeanor?
justice

as
a

from

justice

in
what
percentage
did
you
say?
justice

l.
black
you
--
i
suppose
have
put
in
your
brief
the
names
of
those
cases
and
the
amounts
involved
in
them
substantially
to
the
statement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
this
is
material,
i
should
think,
might
be
wise
to
have
all
record
of
all
those
cases
during
that
period
of
time
with
the
name
where
they
were
tried?
justice

if
i
presume
it
would
be
very
easy
because
you
know.

that's
all
of
them?
justice

is
that
material
here?
justice
hugo

black
if
it's
material,
i
think
if
you're
going
to
state
that
they're
all
small
and
--
but
the
purpose
was
it'd
be
wiser
if
you
give
us
a
list
because
i
don't
think
it's
material.
but
if
it
is
material,
i
think
we
should
be
given
a
list.
justice

not
in
the
general
sense
but
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it's
just
the
same
--
i
wouldn't
decide
on
that
basis
that
a
3616
does
apply
to
income
tax
cases.
that
this
man
could
have
been
prosecuted
under
either.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
he
were.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean,
if
your
position
is
correct.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
and
suppose
your
position
is
wrong.
and
suppose
that
both
statutes
apply.
we
don't
understand
what
you
say
on

that
in
this
case
as
in
berra
and
that
proves
that
he
willfully
attempted

raise

filing
a
false

as
identical
of
that
required
prove
that
he
filed
a
false
return
with
attempt
to
evade
in
violation
of
3616?
that's
what
the
government
argued
in
berra.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
question
i
was
asking
was
in
the
berra
case,
the
government's
brief
said
this
as
i
quote
it
to
the
oral
argument.
section

a
broad
area

is
that
proved
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
reading
from
the
government's
brief
in
the
berra
case.
is
that
true
here
what
the
government
said
about
the
berra
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
do
--
do
this
act
in
this
case,
if
you
are
wrong
and
if
you
can
prosecute
under
either,
are
there
searches
to
justify
a
prosecution
under
both?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
but
maybe
we
might
disagree
with
that.
suppose
we
do,
are
we
to
try
it
on
the
basis
that
if
3616
and
145
(a)
applied,
these
overlap
as
we'd
say
in
the
case
and
the
berra
case.
justice

under
the
facts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
ask
--
i
didn't
ask
you
that
question.
there
was
a
very
simple
statement
in
connection
with
the
berra
prosecution
which
was
presented
to
us
and
it
was
admitted
by
the
government
that
under
the
facts
in
that
case
as
3616
was
then
construed,
the
defendant
could
be
prosecuted
under
either.
is
that
the
case
here
with
reference
to
these
facts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
conceivable
or
is
it
your
judgment
it
could?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
washington
office
sent
to
the
prosecuting
attorneys
in
177
cases
were
made
about
this
one
(inaudible)
177
cases
with
instructions
to
proceed
under
3616?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
whose
choice
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
were
they
prosecuted
by
information?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
made
those
choices?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
suppose
--
i
don't
suppose
it's
too
late
for
any
of
us
to
do
that.
i
simply
wanted
to
find
out
first
if
we
disagreed
with
your
position,
if
these
were
the
same
kind
of
case
as
the
berra
case.
of
course,
if
you
are
wrong
all
that
time
and
the
3616
does
not
cover
income
taxes,
it
should
not
be
held
cover
if
it
doesn't
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.

i'm
delighted
to
see
that's
reproduced
for
counsel
this
time.
