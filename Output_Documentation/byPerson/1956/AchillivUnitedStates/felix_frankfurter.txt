you
don't
suggest
that
--
you
don't
suggest
that
in
the
estoppel,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
just
say
it's
very
persuasive.
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
prosecuting
--
i
take
it
that
you
mean
that
sentences
were
imposed
were
in
3616.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
in
the
commission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
correctly.
when
you
say
it
didn't
apply,
a
prosecution
or
the
conflict
that
is
in
--
in
question
here,
your
contention
is
it
falls
both
within
section
145
and
3616,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
to
say
it
was
--
it
was
--
it
could
be
--
if
it
was
prosecuted
under
3616,
merely
means
to
me
legal
significance
of
that
statement
is
that
the
sentence
that
was
imposed,
the
limits
of
--
of
sentence
provided
for
by
3616
was
given
by
the
judges,
the
various
--
in
those
prosecutions.
does
it
mean
anything
else?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
see
it
as
the
indictment
of
the
information
endorsed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
it
has
to
belie
information?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
i
must
trouble
you
again.
does
that
mean
that
in
none
of
those
of
cases
there
were
grand
jury
proceedings
â€“
preceding
the
trial
on
the
merits?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
hardly
believe
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
my
question
is
a
little
different.
justice
felix
frankfurter
70?
justice
felix
frankfurter
seven
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you
--
if
you
are
right
in
your
present
position,
then
no
matter
how
small,
they
would
all
have
--
the
prosecution
would
all
have
to
be
begun
by
--
before
a
grand
jury
and
by
indictment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
your
--
i
do
not
know
what
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
quite
appreciate
your
answer.
if
the
position
now
taken
by
the
government
is
correct,
then
you
--
then
your
answer
to
justice
black's
question
is,
he
couldn't
be
prosecuted
in
the
3616
and
he's
properly
prosecuted
by
the
only
section
under
which
he
could
be
prosecuted
145
(b).
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
my
hypothesis
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
well,
your
honor,
we
have
a
question
here
as
to
whether
the
--
there
are
one
or
two
offenses
involved.
now,
the
language
of
the
second
circuit
in
the
moran
case
would
seem
to
imply
that
there
are
two
offenses
involved
here
because
each
of
the
sections
requires
proof
of
an
act
which
is
not
required
for
the
other.
but
we
think
that
you
don't
have
to
resolve
that
question
because
even
if
there
are
only
one
offense
here,
involved
here,
we
think
there's
nothing
to
preclude
the
court
from
applying
under
--
from
proceeding
under
the
felony
statute
as
against
the
misdemeanor
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
if
there
--
there
are
two
offenses
when
there
is
no
problem
of
choice
by
a
prosecutor
with
different
terms,
is
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
mean
to
say
--
but
the
problem
doesn't
arise.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
i
know
that
you
don't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
main
position
however,
as
i
understand
it,
and
to
me
it's
very
important
to
determine
whether
its
own
act.
your
main
position
is
that
a
detailed
consideration
which
we
not
yet
had
at
the
legislative
history
of
the
criminal
enforcement
of
the
income
tax.
the
government
demonstrates
145
(b)
as
exclusive,
the
3616
does
not
apply
to
it.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
think
it's
very
important
too,
this
is
a
new
position.
and
for
me,
nothing
has
happened
on
the
fact
that
stops
taking
that
position.
it's
never
too
late
to
find
out
what
congress
really
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
many
often,
we'd
leave
enough
time
for
the
main
problem
that
the
government
has
now
presented
which
is
very
foreign
to
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
with
my
information
at
the
counsel's
time
for
my
enlightenment.
that's
what
counsel
are
here
for,
to
enlighten
the
court
not
to
be
indulging
--
to
be
indulging
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
--
but
it's
still
one
year,
the
punishment
after
1924?
justice
felix
frankfurter
five
years,
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
you
said
a
a
felony,
didn't
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
different
(voice
overlap)
--
put
a
different
punishment
on
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
anything
turned
on
the
1939
code?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
--
that
presuppose
of
--
does
that
mean
any
more
than
that
if
you
are
right,
if
the
government
is
right
as
to
what
--
as
to
the
construction
of
the
predecessor
provision
of
145
(b)
in
the
annuals
or
biannuals
of
congressional
legislation,
1939
didn't
effectuate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
have
to
establish
the
relationship
of
the
two
sections
prior
to
1939.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
congress
--
does
3616
in
your
view
had
any
function
at
all?
does
it
apply
to
a
situation
at
all
in
the
protection
of
the
revenue
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
145
(b)
should
have
sowed
the
field
with
reference
to
income
tax.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
that
it
--
i
understand
that.
what
i
want
to
know
is
assume
145
(b)
is
to
be
given
the
restrictive
and
exclusive
scope
that
is
now
contended
for
by
the
government.
would
3616
go
to
sleep
and
have
no
incidents
at
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
as
to
these
things
but
wouldn't
they
--
would
it
apply
to
other
situations?
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
me
it
must
be
a
very
strong
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
were
to
exist
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i've
put
my
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
there
be
no
set
of
circumstances
to
which
1616
could
be
applied
to
which
145
(b)
wouldn't
apply?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
think
--
for
me
it's
a
very
important
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
one
thing
to
say
that
the
government
is
arguing
for
a
construction
that
would
wipe
out
a
section
quite
a
different
argument
to
say
that
there
are
two
sections
which
have
separate
spheres
of
activity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
as
i
understand
they
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
deal
as
to
what
145
(b)
covered
but
not
as
to
everything.
it
isn't
an
empty
thing
thereafter,
a
collection
of
words
with
no
--
nothing
on
which
you
can
talk.
