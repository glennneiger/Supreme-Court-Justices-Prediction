mr.
peter
b.
atwood
yes,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
indicted
and
convicted
of
willfully
and
knowingly
attempting
to
evade
a
large
part
of
his
income
tax
with
violation
of
section
145
(b)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
for
the
years
1946,
1947
and
1948.
the
trial
court
imposed
a
sentence
of
two
years
on
each
count,
which
would
run
concurrently
and
a
$2000
fine
on
each
count
or
a
total
of
$6000.
on
appeal
to
the
seventh
circuit,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
this
to
the
first
count
for
insufficient
evidence
and
sustained
as
to
the
remaining
two
counts
for
the
years
1947
and
1948.
a
petition
for
rehearing
was
filed
which
was
denied
wherein
in
that
petition
for
the
first
there
was
raised
the
question
of
the
overlap
of
sections
145
(b)
and
section
3616(a)
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
a
petition
for
certiorari
was
denied
on
november
19,
1956
and
later
withdrawn.
subsequent
to
the
denial
of
petition
for
certiorari,
the
case
was
brought
back
to
the
district
court
for
resentencing
under
the
mandate
of
the
court
of
appeals.
at
that
time,
a
further
motion
was
filed
for
correction
and
reduction
of
sentence.
the
substantial
--
filed
the
motion.
it
was
based
upon
the
overlap
of
section
3616
(a)
and
145
(b).
the
court
denied
the
motion
with
respect
to
the
overlap
but
reduced
the
sentence
to
one
year
on
each
of
the
remaining
counts
to
run
concurrently
and
fixed
the
fine
of
$1000
on
each
count
to
be
accumulated
or
a
total
of
$2000.
the
matter
was
brought
before
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
seventh
circuit
and
while
there,
the
court
--
this
court
was
dually
--
one
on
the
denial
of
certiorari
and
both
cases
are
now
before
this
court.
the
contention
which
we
make
in
this
case
is
that
an
attempt
to
evade
taxes
within
the
meaning
of
section
145
(b)
is
the
same
and
identical
thence
provide
in
section
3616
(a)
to
file
a
false
and
fraudulent
return
with
intent
to
defeat
and
evade
the
tax.
the
indictment
which
was
filed
against
the
petitioner
in
this
case
alleged
that
he
willfully
and
knowingly
attempted
to
defeat
and
he
attempted
to
avoid
the
--
and
evade
the
payment
tax
by
the
filing
of
a
false
and
fraudulent
return.
i
think
the
government
admits
the
identity
of
the
offenses
when
it
states
at
page
33
of
its
brief,
the
following,
"in
the
instant
case
as
in
berra
versus
united
states
351
u.s.131
and
indeed
almost
every
case
prosecuted
under
section
145
(b),
the
proof
that
the
defendant
willfully
attempted
to
evade
taxes
by
filing
a
false
return
is
identical
without
that
required
to
prove
that
he
filed
a
false
return
with
intent
to
evade
tax
in
violation
of
section
3616
(a).
the
consequences
of
that
assumption,
i've
set
forth
in
the
--
the
main
brief,
which
we
filed
in
this
clause
to
the
effect
that
there
is
an
identity
of
the
offenses
and
there
cannot
be
a
dual
offense
or
double
conviction
for
a
misdemeanor
and
for
the
penalty.
the
government,
approximately
one
week
before
we
are
about
to
file
our
brief
in
this
case,
the
time
fixed
by
this
court,
made
a
completely,
new
position,
took
a
completely
new
position
with
respect
to
section
3616
(a)
to
the
effect
that
section
–
that
that
section
did
not
apply
to
income
taxes.
that
change
of
position,
i'd
like
to
devote
a
few
minutes
to
because
it
seems
to
me
to
be
quite
important
with
respect
to
the
history
of
this
litigation
and
of
the
statutes
involved.
when
this
costello
case
was
before
this
court
and
which
it
is
at
this
term,
the
government
admitted
that
section
3616
(a)
applied
to
income
taxes
and
stated
as
a
matter
fact
that
it
put
clearly
and
therefore
it
applied
to
income
taxes.
the
government
in
the
dillon
case
in
the
eighth
circuit
had
argued
that
3616
(a)
did
not
applied
to
income
taxes
and
was
successful
in
securing
a
ruling
by
the
eighth
circuit
to
the
effect
that
3616
(a)
did
not
apply
to
income
taxes.
the
government
in
its
--
our
--
our
position
to
--
position
for
certiorari
in
that
case
disavowed
holding
of
the
eighth
circuit
and
said
that
3616
(a)
did
apply
to
income
taxes.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
prepared
an
appendix
to
a
brief
in
the
later
cases,
one
of
which
was
(inaudible)
case
which
is
also
pending
before
this
court,
in
which
it
prepared
an
appendix
to
that
brief
and
which
was
send
around
to
the
various
district
attorneys
throughout
the
united
states
to
be
used
in
what
we
call
boilerplate
in
cases,
the
--
involving
the
same
subject.
in
other
words,
urging
the
court's
--
mr.
peter
b.
atwood
in
this
appendix,
your
honors,
that
--
mr.
chief
justice,
is
to
the
effect
that
the
--
mr.
peter
b.
atwood
no.
mr.
peter
b.
atwood
that
is
true
your
honor.
and
furthermore,
they
cited
the
same
historical
material
in
which
they
--
they
call
materials
that
they
cite
here,
in
this
case.
mr.
peter
b.
atwood
no,
i
do
not,
your
honor.
not
at
all,
not
at
all.
mr.
peter
b.
atwood
i
say
it
goes
to
part
of
the
history,
which
i
like
to
bring
out
as
we
go
along
with
respect
to
that
subject.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
--
the
eighth
circuit
in
the
dillon
case
also
stated
that
section
7207
of
the
1954
code
which
is
the
counterpart
of
section
3616
(a)
of
the
1939
code
applied
to
income
taxes.
the
court
--
or
failed
in
that
case
to
take
congress
into
the
fact
that
two
reports
that
congress,
the
senate
and
the
house
with
respect
to
the
1954
code
specifically
stated
that
the
section
7207
was
not
intended
to
make
any
change
in
existing
law.
the
--
the
government
also
as
far
back
as
1952
admits
that
they
have
been
prosecuting
these
cases
under
section
3616
(a).
they
say
that
prior
to
that
time
there
was
no
judicial
holding
that
3616
(a)
did
not
apply
to
income
taxes
or
any
innovation
to
that
effect.
however,
they
do
not
disclose
in
their
brief
--
mr.
peter
b.
atwood
or
an
information
file
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
peter
b.
atwood
yes.
there
were
--
they
say
that
up
prior
--
prior
to
1952
there
were
no
cases
holding
that
3616
did
not
apply
to
income
taxes
and
rely
solely
on
the
dillon
case
as
indicating
that
as
the
first
holding
in
which
the
court
--
they
are
determined
that
3616
(a)
did
not
apply.
mr.
peter
b.
atwood
that
is
true,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
peter
b.
atwood
it
means
this
that
the
district
attorneys
in
filing
an
information
against
the
taxpayer
relied
on
section
3616
(a).
mr.
peter
b.
atwood
information
there
--
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
there
were
--
there
would
be
no
indictment
involving
3616
(a)
because
of
its
being
a
misdemeanor.
mr.
peter
b.
atwood
i
think
so,
your
honor.
the
--
prior
to
--
well,
then
the
government
proceeds
in
its
brief
to
disclose
a
considerable
amount
manner
of
statistics
showing
that
since
1952,
a
177
cases
have
been
prosecuted
under
section
3616
(a).
mr.
peter
b.
atwood
the
information
disclosed
in
their
--
mr.
peter
b.
atwood
their
brief
in
the
case
they
were
by
information.
mr.
peter
b.
atwood
177,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
peter
b.
atwood
however,
prior
to
1952,
the
government
itself
urged
in
many
cases
which
it
cites
at
page
39
of
its
brief.
i
believe
its
39,
to
the
effect
that
section
3616
(a)
is
applicable
to
income
taxes.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
cites
a
case
dated
back
in
1945
in
which
it
was
urged
the
koppelman
case.
in
which
it
was
heard
that
the
3616
(a)
applied
to
income
tax
proceedings
where
the
petitioner
there
was
seeking
probation.
and
the
district
attorney
opposed
probation
on
the
ground
that
he
had
filed
a
false
and
fraudulent
return
in
violation
of
section
3616
(a).
the
position
we
take
with
respect
to
that
is
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
government
at
this
late
stage,
approximately
a
week
prior
to
the
filing
of
our
return,
with
this
change
of
position
feels
and
must
feel
that
unless
they
are
successful
with
respect
to
that
contention,
they
have
lost
this
case.
i'd
like
to
advert
now
directly
to
the
history
of
section
3616
(a).
but
i
think
it's
--
the
crux
of
this
whole
case
and
i
think
the
government
has
pitched
its
own
case
on
that
argument.
certainly,
that
congress
itself
in
our
brief
history
of
the
matter
is
set
forth
at
page
3
of
our
brief.
the
congress
it's
--
of
our
reply
brief,
that
congress
itself
as
stated
in
the
1954
code
that
the
derivation
of
section
3616
(a)
or
--
or
section
7207
of
the
1954
code
is
section
3616
(a).
in
the
1939
code,
that
congress
has
stated
that
the
derivation
of
section
3616
(a)
is
section
3179
of
revised
statutes.
the
two
reports
of
the
house
and
the
senate,
which
i
adverted
to
you
before,
both
specifically
state
that
the
1954
code
with
respect
to
section
7207
did
not
change
the
existing
law.
now,
the
question
is
then
i
think
to
back
and
see
the
antecedence
of
section
3616.
3616
had
its
derivation
in
revised
statutes
of
section
3179
which
first
appeared
in
revised
statutes
of
1874.
the
predecessor
of
that
section
was
the
act
of
1798
as
shown
by
the
materials
which
were
submitted
by
the
government
and
which
applied
--
there
was,
of
course,
no
income
tax
at
that
time.
in
1861
and
1862,
there
was
an
income
tax.
and
the
government
admits
that
section
--
that
the
predecessor
of
section
3179
applied
to
the
income
tax
provisions
of
the
act
of
1861
and
1864.
in
1864,
congress
passed
a
supplement
to
the
revenue
laws,
which
contained
certain
administrative
provisions,
one
of
which
was
section
15.
section
15
later
became
section
3179
of
revised
statutes.
it
reads
as
follows,
"whenever
any
person
delivers
or
discloses
to
the
collector
or
deputy
any
false
and
fraudulent
list,
return
account
or
statement
with
intent
to
defeat
or
evade
evaluation,
enumeration
or
assessment
intended
to
be
made
or
being
dully
summoned
to
appear
to
testify
or
to
appear
and
produce
such
books
as
aforesaid,
neglects
and
so
forth
shall
be
fined
not
exceeding
$1000
or
imprisoned
--
or
imprisoned
not
exceeding
one
year.”
the
government
urges
that
that
provision
was
superseded
by
later
legislation
with
respect
to
income
taxes
and
relies
upon
the
act
of
1898
as
it
started.
it
states
that
the
act
of
1898
marked
the
resumption
of
a
congressional
policy,
which
was
in
--
though
not
in
effect
in
1874
had
been
followed
ever
since
of
incorporating,
under
each
revenue
act,
specific
criminal
penalties.
now,
it
relies
on
the
act
of
1898,
which
provided
that
if
any
manufacturer
shall
make
any
false
or
untrue
declaration,
such
person
shall
be
deemed
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor.
now,
it
seems
to
me
quite
obvious
that
that
provision
could
not
apply
to
the
exclusion
of
section
3179
because
it
did
not
require
a
proof
of
an
intent
to
evade
tax
which
was
one
of
the
requirements
of
section
3179.
the
--
there
is
therefore,
a
different
case
--
a
different
proof
required
under
the
1898
act
as
compared
with
section
3179.
mr.
peter
b.
atwood
i
think
that's
their
whole
case,
your
honor.
that
there
was
a
repeal,
pro
tanto
as
they
say
of
section
31
--
mr.
peter
b.
atwood
so,
it
means
that
it
would
have
applied
only
three
other
different
taxes.
mr.
peter
b.
atwood
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
official
(inaudible)
tax
that
they
refer
to
is
covered
by
specific
legislation,
which
is
referred
to
in
the
reply
brief
of
the
government.
mr.
peter
b.
atwood
i
do
feel
that
they
--
they
have
the
--
they've
taken
the
position
of
3616
does
not
applied
to
income
taxes
at
all.
even
--
mr.
peter
b.
atwood
well,
no.
they
did
apply
to
income
tax
cases
when
there
were
income
tax
laws
in
effect
but
they
had
taken
the
position
that
when
congress
was
about
the
specific
criminal
penalties
and
later
legislation,
they
did
so
to
the
exclusion
of
section
3179.
and
they
start
with
this
1898
act
as
indicating
that.
and
as
i
just
pointed
out
the
1898
act
was
a
much
narrower
act.
it
provided
a
smaller
penalty.
it
didn't
have
the
qualification
of
intent
to
evade
which
was
in
the
--
in
the
3179
provision.
nor
did
it
have
the
later
--
the
other
requirement
in
the
section
3179
which
was
that
any
person
summoned
to
testify
or
to
produce
books
shall
be
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor.
that
was
not
in
the
1898
act.
so,
obviously
in
my
opinion
the
both
were
--
were
supplementary
to
each.
they
complimented
each
other.
then
the
government
proceeds
to
say
that
the
1909
act
set
a
pattern
with
respect
to
the
subject.
the
1909
act
was,
of
course,
not
an
income
tax
but
a
tax,
an
excise
tax
on
the
corporations
by
measured
by
income.
and
that
tax
also
was
very
limited,
that
specific
criminal
provisioning
--
provision
which
was
contained
in
paragraph
8
of
the
act
of
1909
provided
that
any
person
authorized
by
law
to
make,
render,
sign
or
verify
any
return
who
makes
any
false
and
fraudulent
return
or
statement
with
intent
to
evade
or
defeat
the
tax
imposed
shall
be
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor.
well
there
again,
there
was
very
limited
scope
to
section
--
paragraph
8
of
the
act
of
1909
in
that
it
applied
only
to
persons
who
were
required
to
render,
sign
or
verify
the
return.
whereas
that
section
3179
applied
to
anyone
who
was
required
--
who
--
who
--
disclosed
or
delivered
a
return
to
the
collector.
it
also
applied
as
i've
just
mentioned,
to
anyone
who
supplied
--
who
were
refused
to
produce
books
or
to
testify.
that
issue
was
not
covered
by
the
act
of
1909.
and
therefore
again,
both
acts
could
exist
together
and
apply
to
the
income
tax
proceeding.
the
government
says
then
that
there
were
no
specific
legislation
thereafter
which
indicated
that
the
--
the
section
3179
applied
to
income
tax
proceedings
because
thereafter,
commerce
legislated
specifically
on
the
subject.
however,
that
is
not
the
case.
actually,
there
were
only
two
revenue
acts
between
1909
and
1928,
which
specifically
dealt
with
income
taxes.
that
was
--
the
very
first
one
was
the
revenue
act
of
1913.
now,
that
act
too
is
very
limited
in
scope.
i
like
to
refer
the
language
of
that
which
appears
at
page
17
of
our
main
brief,
which
begins
that
if
any
person
liable
to
make
the
return
or
pay
the
tax
shall
neglect
to
refuse
and
any
person
required
by
law
to
make,
render
and
sign
which
is
the
same
language
which
was
contained
in
the
1909
act.
and
again,
was
limited
to
persons
who
were
required
to
file
a
return
and
didn't
apply,
for
instance,
to
an
accountant
who
would
deliver
a
list
or
a
statement
to
the
collector
or
the
director
which
would
prove
to
be
fraudulent
or
false.
so
that
again,
section
3179
would
equally
apply
to
a
criminal
undertaking
on
the
part
of
a
taxpayer
or
a
representative
of
the
taxpayer
under
the
1913
act.
then
to
the
1913
act,
it
didn't
contain
the
language,
which
was
contained
in
section
3179
relating
to
the
production
of
books
or
the
testifying
before
an
internal
revenue
agent
or
representative.
the
government
then
says
that
the
revenue
act
of
1918
is
an
evidence
of
congress
intending
that
its
specific
criminal
provisions
shall
be
applied
exclusively
to
income
tax
proceedings.
there
again,
we
have
a
very
limited
provision
in
the
--
in
the
criminal
provisions
of
the
revenue
act
of
1918.
the
revenue
act
of
1918
provided
that
anyone
who
attempts
to
evade
or
defeat
the
tax
imposed
by
that
chapter
shall
be
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor.
they
added
the
words
"in
any
manner."
in
other
words,
anyone
who
attempts
in
any
manner
to
defeat
or
evade
the
tax
shall
be
guilty
for
a
misdemeanor.
but
there
again,
the
use
of
the
words
"in
any
manner,"
would
not
enlarge
the
meaning
of
the
act
because
the
congress
is
not
required
to
set
forth
the
details
of
--
of
the
manner
in
which
an
evasion
shall
take
place.
so
that
the
revenue
act
of
1917
which
dealt
with
the
same
subject
but
which
left
out
the
words
in
any
manner
would
have
the
same
scope
with
the
1918
act.
the
congress
it
seems
to
me
decided
in
1918
to
punish
attempts
as
such
which
are
to
distinguished
from
the
merely
--
from
the
mere
filing
of
a
false
and
fraudulent
return
which
was
still
a
misdemeanor
under
section
3179
which
provided
however,
only
$1000
fine.
in
other
words,
in
the
revenue
act
1918,
congress
decided
to
make
the
penalty
for
attempts
a
more
serious
offense
and
made
the
punishment
$10,000
but
still
provided
it
would
be
a
misdemeanor.
i
think
the
distinction
between
an
attempt
to
evade
tax
is
to
be
--
is
--
is
--
is
to
--
it's
very
important
in
this
case
because
in
the
--
those
cases
in
which
the
government
has
relied
upon
the
attempts
provision
of
section
145
(b)
and
possibly
this
section
in
1918
act,
it
has
always
delineated
the
attempts
which
the
taxpayer
has
--
is
carrying
out
for
the
purpose
of
evading
his
tax.
for
instance,
he
has
concealed
assets.he
has
made
false
entries
in
his
books.
he
has
given
false
testimony
to
a
revenue
agent
or
he
has
withheld
transactions
from
his
records
or
in
any
of
the
variety
of
ways
depending
upon
the
genius
of
a
taxpayer
to
attempt
to
evade
the
tax
as
distinguished
from
filing
a
return.
in
those
cases,
in
1918,
the
congress
said,
“where
you
attempt
to
do
these
things,
commit
this
affirmative
acts,
we
will
make
the
punishment
$10,000
and
still
keep
so
to
speak,
section
3179
and
apply
to
the
filing
of
a
false
and
fraudulent
return”,
would
intend
to
evade
the
tax.
congress
apparently
believing
that
the
two
sections
did
coexist,
if
the
section
3179
were
applied
to
what
the
government
later
called
“minor
cases”
because
the
government
has
admitted
in
this
case,
that
they
have
prosecuted
for
over
five
years
individuals
under
section
3616
for
"minor"
cases.
now,
this
would
still
even
attack
the
revenue
act
of
--
even
attack
section
3179.
i
also
want
to
point
out
that
in
all
of
these
cases
where
the
congress
was
enacting
legislation,
it
was
also
amending
the
revised
statutes.
and
that
it
was
amending
revised
statutes,
which
were
right
alongside
of
section
3179
but
never
at
anytime
amended
section
3179
or
indicated
that
it
was
refilling
section
3179.
then
comes
along
the
1924
act
which
reverted
it
to
the
language
of
the
1917
act
and
apply
to
attempts
to
evade
tax
and
referred
it
to
two
or
three
accounts
and
made
it
a
felony.
however,
that
act
did
not
apply
to
income
taxes
alone.
it
applied
to
all
forms
of
taxes.
and
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
language
which
appeared
in
the
government's
brief
at
page
26
on
what
--
where
it
makes
reference
to
the
1924
act.
and
states
in
the
income
tax
field,
the
provision
first
appearing
in
the
1924
act,
that
"any
person
who
willfully
attempts
in
any
manner
to
evade
or
defeat
any
tax
imposed
by
this
chapter
or
the
payment,
thereof,
shall
be
guilty
of
a
felony."
now,
the
word
"chapter"
does
not
appear
in
the
act.
the
word
actually
is
"act".
so
that
should
read
any
tax
imposed
by
this
act.
then
counsel
went
on
in
its
brief
to
quote,
from
the
late
justice
jackson
concerning
that
section
being
the
capstone
of
our
system
of
sanctions.
i
think
the
reference
there
is
--
is
erroneous
because
in
the
1924
act
--
the
1924
or
the
penal
provisions
did
not
relate
only
to
income
tax
but
to
all
forms
of
tax.
if
the
court
please,
i
like
to
reserve
partly
10
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
peter
b.
atwood
five
more.
mr.
peter
b.
atwood
thank
you.
mr.
peter
b.
atwood
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
peter
b.
atwood
i
have
just
a
few
remarks
to
make.
they
deal
principally
with
the
--
what
i
consider
there
and
then
--
in
the
administrative
approval
on
the
part
of
congress
in
reenacting
section
3616
(a)
in
the
1954
code
of
section
7207
of
the
1954
code.
when
congress
did
that
as
i
mentioned
in
my
earlier
argument
specifically
stated
that
it
was
not
changing
existing
law
and
congress
of
course
must
have
been
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
government
had
been
prosecuting
for
more
than
two
years
prior
to
the
revenue
act
of
1954,
many
cases
under
section
3616
(a)
for
income
tax
violations.
i've
also
pointed
out
that
as
far
back
as
1926
in
the
noveck
case,
the
government
argued
that
section
3616
(a)
wasn't
applicable
to
income
taxes
but
it
was
nevertheless
proceeding
over
a
period
of
years
in
many
cases
to
argue
that
it
was
applicable.
in
the
cases
i've
cited
at
page
15
of
my
reply
brief
and
there
are
many
cases
there
i've
cited.
and
of
course,
as
late
as
1945
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
the
government
argued
that
it
was
applicable.
certainly,
in
those
cases,
the
government
was
of
course
consistent
throughout
that
period
of
time
in
the
time
when
saying
it
was
applicable.
in
any
simple
reading
of
section
3616
(a)
would
indicate
that
it
was
applicable.
absent
this
detailed
history
which
they
now
say
means
that
it
was
inapplicable
income
tax.
mr.
peter
b.
atwood
mr.
justice
--
mr.
peter
b.
atwood
i
feel
this
way,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
it
supplements
section
145
(b)
in
that,
it
provides
a
lesser
penalty
for
what
congress
may
have
thought
was
a
smaller
offense.
mr.
peter
b.
atwood
i
think
that
would
be
the
effect
of
it,
yes.
mr.
peter
b.
atwood
in
then
--
mr.
peter
b.
atwood
i
think
it
would
--
mr.
peter
b.
atwood
i
think
it
would
still
exist
because
as
section
3616
applies
to
false
testimony
and
applies
to
failure
to
give
--
produce
records
and
all
those
things
which
do
apply
to
income
taxes.
mr.
peter
b.
atwood
i
don't
know
whether
it
follow
--
mr.
peter
b.
atwood
yes.
mr.
peter
b.
atwood
i
can't
think
of
any
now.
i
think
it
would
be
ineffective
when
applied
anything
according
to
the
government's
argument.
mr.
peter
b.
atwood
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
b.
atwood
i
do
not
think
the
argument
had
had
a
separate
sphere
of
activity.
mr.
peter
b.
atwood
the
argument
is
repealed.
mr.
peter
b.
atwood
they
--
they
argue,
i
believe
--
mr.
peter
b.
atwood
i
rely
on
the
fact
that
the
government
was
prosecuting
for
many
years
under
section
3616
(a)
and
congress
knew
that
and
reenacted
section
720
--
3616
(a)
as
part
of
7207
of
the
revenue
act
of
1954
which
clearly
dealt
with
income
taxes.
mr.
peter
b.
atwood
that's
from
1952
to
1954
and
then
in
the
prior
years,
the
--
in
the
many
cases
which
i've
cited
at
page
15
of
my
brief,
they
argued
that
it
was
applicable
to
income
taxes
and
congress
presumed
they
could
be
aware
of
that
argument.
thank
you.
