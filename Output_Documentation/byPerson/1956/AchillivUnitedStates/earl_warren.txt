what
did
they
--
what
did
they
say
to
their

their
district
attorneys
in
that
regard?

of
it.
i
don't
ask
you
to
read
a
lot
of
it

--
did

in
effect
urge
them
to
--
to
act
upon

as
though
it

would
they
be
doing
as
they
sometimes
do
in
other
cases,
say
in
an
embezzlement
case
where
$50,000
has
been
embezzled,
maybe
they'll
only
charge
a
$1000
or
$500
because
those
items
are
clear
to
make
that
