mr.
charles
k.
rice
please
the
court.
the
number
of
briefs
of
amicus
curiae
which
have
been
filed
in
this
case,
there
are
some
evidence
of
the
importance
of
the
case
and
as
far
as
the
revenue
collection
system
is
concerned,
of
course,
the
downgrading
of
the
criminal
sanctions
from
the
status
of
a
felony
to
that
of
a
misdemeanor
is
a
matter
of
extreme
importance.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
if
the
section
145
(b)
did
not
exist?
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well,
our
position
is
that
section
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
there
has
been
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
it
appears
on
its
face
to
cover
the
offense
charge
and
that
i
think
is
the
reason
why
over
a
period
extending
back
to
19
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
if
there
is
anything
that
has
distinguished
the
tax
collection
system
in
the
united
states
from
that
in
foreign,
in
any
foreign
countries
is
the
seriousness
of
which
the
criminal
sanctions
imposed
in
the
united
states
have
been
viewed.
this
court
in
the
spies
case
has
referred
to
the
felony
sanctions
as
the
capstone
of
a
system
designed
to
meet
every
offense
against
the
revenue
laws.
and
we
think
that
the
system
was
deliberately
intended
to
impose
felony
sanctions
as
evidenced
by
the
eight
successive
acts
of
congress
culminating
in
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939.
now,
i
would
like
to
say
a
few
words,
at
the
outset
as
to
the
practice
within
the
department
of
justice
with
respect
to
the
application
of
section
3616.
that
section
as
far
as
income
tax
is
concerned,
of
laying
--
laid
in
a
disregarded
form
for
many
years
and
had
not
been
applied
as
a
matter
of
policy
with
respect
to
income
tax
prosecutions.
there
had
been
an
occasional
reference
to
what
does
in
the
koppelman
case
in
1945
in
connection
with
whether
or
not
a
man
had
violated
the
terms
of
his
probation.
but
as
far
as
prosecution
policy
is
concerned,
the
department
had
not
authorized
prosecutions
under
section
3616
at
anytime
prior
to
the
middle
part
of
1952.
and
the
reason
for
it
--
that
it
did
that
at
that
time
was
this,
in
the
post
war
period
with
the
great
increase
in
tax
rates
and
the
great
number
of
great
increase
in
the
number
of
taxpayers,
it
was
obvious
that
the
great
bulk
of
the
income
was
coming
and
had
to
come
from
those
who
were
in
the
middle-income
brackets
and
the
small-income
brackets.
and
the
internal
revenue
service
felt
that
a
strict
enforcement
policy
with
respect
to
both
the
middle-income
and
low-income
brackets
was
necessary
in
order
to
ensure
the
proper
collection
of
the
revenue.
so,
the
result
was
that
beginning
in
the
late
1940's
and
early
1950's,
the
department
of
justice
began
to
receive,
in
very
substantial
numbers,
a
large
number
of
cases
in
which
against
taxpayers,
recommending
felony
prosecutions.
in
some
of
these
cases,
the
amount
of
tax
involved
was
no
more
than
a
hundred
dollars
and
the
amounts
in
--
in
very
substantial
of
the
cases
was
very
small.
at
that
time,
the
department
was
proceeding
on
a
--
on
the
basis
of
felony
prosecutions
in
all
cases
and
the
cases
continue
to
be
send
out
for
criminal
prosecution
although
some
of
them
are
amounted
in
tax,
no
more
than
a
$100.
as
you
could
well
imagine,
the
--
the
these
cases
met
with
considerable
resistance
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
district
courts
and
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
attorneys
in
the
various
districts.
there
were
complaints
that
the
district
courts
were
being
turned
into
police
courts,
that
we
were
getting
back
into
the
prohibition
days
and
that
something
had
to
be
done
about
the
flow
of
these
small
cases,
which
was
reaching
the
courts.
so,
casting
about
in
an
effort
to
meet
this
situation
and
in
an
effort
to
make
the
punishment
fit
the
offense,
recourse
was
had
to
section
3616
(a)
of
the
code
which
i
said
a
moment
appeared
on
its
face
and
in
general
terms
to
apply
to
all
tax
offenses
including
the
income
tax.
so,
beginning
at
that
time
about
7%
of
the
cases
each
year
was
sent
out
for
prosecution
under
3616
(a)
instead
of
145
(b)
of
the
felony
provisions.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
from
the
department
of
--
here
in
washington
to
the
united
states
attorneys.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
instructing
them
to
proceed
under
section
3616
(a)
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
as
a
misdemeanor
--
yes.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
it's
about
7%.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
seven.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
--
of
the
entire
number
of
cases.
now,
in
the
majority
of
these
cases,
the
proceedings
were
by
information
but
in
a
fairly
substantial
number,
then
the
proceedings
were
also
by
--
or
were
by
indictment
rather
than
by
information.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
yes,
your
honor.
the
figures
are
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
page
14
and
15
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
i'm
including
my
remarks
with
respect
to
the
(inaudible)
the
application
of
3616.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
purposes
applying
that
particular
section
were
to
--
to
meet
the
protest
of
the
district
courts,
the
various
district
courts
and
the
united
states
attorneys
in
the
various
districts.
and
to
ameliorate
a
lot
of
the
small
taxpayer
who
was
being
subjected
to
a
felony
prosecution
and
summonses
where
the
tax
involved
was
as
low
as
a
$100
or
a
$150.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
no,
your
honor.
we
haven't
got
the
names
of
the
cases.
we
have
a
reference
of
the
total
amounts
of
the
cases.
they
have
the
list
of
the
amounts
involved.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
oh,
we
could
give
you
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
yes.
we
could
give
you
the
--
i
think
that
we
can
state
it
as
a
general
proposition
that
those
prosecutions
involved
less
than
a
$1000
in
income.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
that
was
tax,
sir.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
less
than
a
$1000
in
income
and
of
course
considerably
below
that
in
tax.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well,
i
wouldn't
want
to
say
that
there
never
has
been
an
exception
to
that
but
that
has
been
the
general
practice.
and
as
far
as
the
amounts
involved,
i
haven't
actually
made
a
study
of
the
cases
myself
to
determine
whether
it's
a
$100
or
$200
or
$300
or
$400
but
i
think
i
can
fairly
say
and
we
will
be
glad
to
furnish
whatever
he
would
like
in
that
respect
that
the
amounts
involved
were
not
large.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
if
3616
has
no
application
in
this
area.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
yes.
well,
that
i
think
is
true
in
almost
every
criminal
tax
case.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
not
every
case
but
in
most
of
them,
you
have
what
they
call
the
prosecutor
of
the
net
income
for
prosecution
purposes,
and
that
is
very
frequently
less
than
--
but
for
civil
--
what
they
would
allege
for
civil
purposes.
so
what
i'm
talking
about
is
the
amount
alleged
for
criminal
purposes.
now,
a
very
large
percentage
of
these
small
cases
where
the
result
of
the
claim
of
a
fictitious
defendant
where
a
person
would
claim
that
john
jones
and
richard
rowe
were
defendants
when
actually
there
was
no
such
person
as
john
jones
or
richard
rowe.
and
the
amount
of
the
exemption
being
$600
for
each
of
them
and
would
result
in
a
fairly
small
tax
and
yet
the
fraud
would
be
so
clear
cut
that
it
was
difficult
to
overlook
at.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
so
that
the
--
the
purpose
in
bringing
these
prosecutions
under
section
3616
was
i
think
to
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well,
i
don't
think
it's
material
either,
your
honor
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
i
don't
think
it's
material
either.
what
i'm
saying
here
is
by
way
of
background
as
to
how
the
department
got
embarked
on
this
particular
course
of
action.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
yes.
i
would
say
the
majority
of
them
--
the
large
majority
of
them
--
there
were
of
course
some
by
indictment.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well,
of
course
that
question
isn't
decided
as
yet
whether
or
not
they
should
have
been
prosecuted
at
all.
we
don't
have
before
us
a
section
3616
case.
now,
in
concluding
these
--
these
remarks
with
respect
to
3616,
i
think
i
should
say
that
whether
or
not,
the
government
proceeded
correctly
under
the
section
it
invoked
as
a
matter
that
we
just
don't
know
or
prosecutions
under
that
section
have
been
held
in
advance
pending
the
outcome
of
this
proceeding.
and
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
it
is
a
145
(b)
case
and
we
think
that
the
issue
as
to
a
3616
case
ought
to
be
resolved
when
such
a
case
comes
before
this
court.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well,
there
again,
that
question
is
not
before
the
court
because
he
was
prosecuted
under
section
145
(b).
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well,
i
think
that's
correct.
of
course
in
the
moran
case,
being
the
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
yes.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well,
we
--
we
all
think
of
it
in
terms
of
choice
for
the
prosecutor
your
honor.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
yes.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
where
are
you
reading
from?
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well,
it
is
true
to
the
extent
that
you
have
two
offenses
which
the
same
act
could
violate.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well,
your
honor,
our
position
is
that
you
don't
have
to
decide
that
question.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
i
just
can't
say
as
to
what
would
be
done
in
that
situation.
it
hasn't
been
done
in
the
past.
there
haven't
been
prosecutions
under
both
sections.
i
think
it's
highly
unlikely
there
would
be.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well,
yes.
i
think
it
is.
in
other
words,
when
we
brought
the
145
(b)
prosecution,
it
is
conceivable
that
the
court
could
have
found
the
defendant
guilty
under
3616
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
it
could
have.
it
could
have,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
that
we
could
have
prosecuted
under
either?
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well
we
believe
it
is
a
matter
within
the
discretion
of
the
court
that
the
court
could
have
found
the
defendant
guilty
under
145
(b),
or
it
could
have
found
him
guilty
under
3616
(a).
not
a
matter
of
the
prosecutor's
discretion.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
that
was
the
choice
of
the
prosecutor.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well,
i
think
that
most
of
them
were.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
there
--
there
were
really
some
--
that
was
made
by
the
department,
by
the
prosecutor.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well,
i
think
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well,
your
honor,
with
respect
to
the
legislative
history
of
section
3616,
a
section
which
states
back
--
which
dates
back
to
1798,
our
research
has
indicated
there
is
the
gravest
doubt
as
to
whether
it
applies
or
contended
to
apply
to
federal
income
tax
as
we
have
known
it
since
1913.
now,
back
in
the
civil
war
days
when
you
have
the
acts
of
1861,
1862
and
1864,
where
they
included
a
statute
which
was
very
similar
to
3616
within
the
act
itself,
i
think
it
is
safe
to
assume
that
that
act
did
apply
to
this
civil
war
income
tax
which
did
not
have
any
other
sanctions
of
itself.
and
again
in
1894,
when
the
income
tax
law
was
passed
which
was
held
unconstitutional
by
this
court
in
the
pollock
against
farmers'
loan
&
trust
company
case.
there
again,
we
had
no
sanctions
within
the
statute.
so,
and
it
seems
fair
to
assume
that
the
sanctions
of
section
--
had
become
in
1874,
3179
of
the
revised
statutes
was
intended
to
be
the
specific
sanction
which
would
apply
to
that
particular
act.
but
when
we
come
down
to
the
war
revenue
act
of
1894,
which
were
not
an
income
tax
law
but
a
general
revenue
act,
that
act
had
specific
penalties
and
it
provided
that
if
any
manufacturer
or
maker
makes
a
false
run
through
declaration,
he
shall
be
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor
with
a
sentence
of
six
months
in
prison
or
$500
fine
or
both.
now,
there
we
had
specific
penalties
applying
to
that
particular
act
and
it
would
appear
that
the
general
earlier
provision
of
the
1874
revised
statutes
were
superseded
pro
tanto.
again
in
1909,
when
that
corporation
exercised
tax
of
that
year
measured
by
corporate
income
was
passed
--
it
had
passed
specific
penalties
for
the
making
of
a
fraudulent
--
false
or
fraudulent
return
with
intent
to
defeat
the
assessment
of
one
year
in
prison
or
$1000
fine,
which
incidentally
with
the
same
penalties
as
those
in
the
3179
of
the
revised
statutes.
in
the
revenue
act
of
1913,
which
is
the
first
of
the
various
revenue
acts
that
followed
thereafter
and
from
1913
to
about
until
1939,
it
was
the
practice
of
congress
to
enact
a
new
revenue
act
about
every
two
years.
each
of
those
acts
would
be
a
complete
reenactment
of
the
income
tax
laws
as
they
had
existed
up
to
that
time.
in
the
revenue
act
of
1913,
the
first
of
such
acts,
congress
provided
that
whoever
made
a
false
or
fraudulent
return
with
intent
to
defeat
the
assessment
would
be
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor
and
subject
to
a
year
in
the
prison
on
a
$2000
fine.
the
fine
in
this
--
in
that
act,
the
$2000
was
greater
than
the
$1000
fine
imposed
by
section
3179
of
the
revised
statutes.
and
we
think
that
that
indicates
that
the
specific
penalty
of
that
particular
act
was
intended
to
apply
to
the
crime
of
income
tax
evasion
rather
than
the
more
general
provision
carrying
a
lesser
penalty.
the
revenue
act
of
1917
had
the
same
provision
as
to
a
false
and
fraudulent
return
with
intent
to
defeat
an
assessment
and
added
a
new
provision
making
it
a
misdemeanor
to
evade
or
attempt
to
evade
a
tax
in
any
manner.
in
the
revenue
act
of
1918,
the
law,
for
the
first
time
prescribed
an
attempt
to
evade
tax
in
any
manner
and
we
believe
that
the
addition
of
the
words
in
any
manner
in
that
act
made
it
unnecessary
for
the
law
of
any
further
to
have
references
to
the
evasion
and
to
the
filing
of
the
false
or
fraudulent
return.
and
significantly,
the
--
that
term
was
dropped
in
the
1918
act
and
is
not
appeared
in
any
revenue
act
since
that
time.
in
the
revenue
act
of
1924,
the
congress
raised
the
penalties
for
a
willful
evasion
of
income
tax
from
a
misdemeanor
to
a
felony.
and
from
that
time,
1924
until
1939,
the
successive
revenue
acts
have
prescribed
an
attempt
to
evade
income
tax
as
a
felony
with
no
material
change
in
the
wording
of
a
statute.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
1924
was
five
years.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
and
it
continued
that
way
in
each
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
yes,
made
a
felony.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
yes,
that's
right,
your
honor.
in
19
--
that
brings
us
to
1939
which
the
--
in
--
the
year
in
which
the
internal
revenue
code
of
that
year
was
adopted.
that
code
is
to
be
distinguished
from
the
1954
internal
revenue
code
in
that
it
did
not
purport
to
be
in
any
sense
a
--
did
not
change
the
law
in
any
respect.
it
was
merely
bringing
together
as
the
legislator
said
into
one
volume
laws
that
have
been
scattered
through
a
number
of
volumes.
and
the
fear
of
the
legislators
as
indicated
in
the
legislative
history
was
that
some
change
in
the
law
might
be
made
inadvertently,
most
of
the
discussion
on
the
congressional
record
relates
to
whether
those
fears
on
the
laying
of
those
fears
for
the
sponsors
that
no
change
had
been
made
in
the
revenue
laws
that
existed
prior
to
that
time.
of
course
that
is
not
true
at
all
in
the
1954
code
which
incorporated
any
number
of
amendments.
but
this
was
merely
a
compilation
and
somewhat
along
the
lines
of
the
changes
in
the
judicial
code
or
referred
to
by
this
court
in
the
fourco
glass
company
case
here
earlier
in
this
term.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well,
we
want
to
show
that
because
--
that
the
bringing
of
section
3179
of
the
revised
statutes
into
the
code
and
labeling
it
3616,
did
not
mean
that
there
was
any
change
in
the
scope
or
ambit
of
the
section
as
it
had
existed
prior
to
that
time.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
yes.
that's
right.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
yes,
that's
right,
sir.
we
think
that
a
comparison
of
the
section
3616
with
other
statutes
in
pari
materia
throughout
the
code
and
outside
of
the
internal
revenue
code
will
indicate
the
ludicrous
and
almost
absurd
results
which
would
follow
if
it
were
to
be
deemed
that
the
following
of
a
false
and
fraudulent
return
with
intent
to
evade
tax
amounted
to
no
more
than
a
felony.
for
example,
take
section
145
(a)
of
the
code
which
relates
to
acts
of
omission
of
a
failure
to
file
a
return
or
to
furnish
information.
under
that
section,
the
penalty
is
one
year
in
jail
with
a
$10,000
fine.
but
if
the
petitioner
is
right
that
the
offense
he
committed
was
only
a
misdemeanor,
his
acts
of
omission
would
result
in
a
year
in
jail
and
a
$1000
fine
or
substantially
less
penalty
than
the
acts
of
omission.
again,
with
respect
to
section
3793
of
the
code
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
with
respect
to
section
3793
of
the
code,
which
prescribed
the
willful
aiding
or
assisting
in
the
preparation
of
a
false
or
fraudulent
return,
if
the
petitioner
is
correct
in
his
position,
the
person
who
assist
in
the
filing
--
preparation
and
filing
of
such
a
return
will
receive
a
penalty
of
five
years
in
jail
and
a
$10,000
fine.but
the
one
who
actually
files
the
return
receives
only
one
year
and
$1000
fine.
