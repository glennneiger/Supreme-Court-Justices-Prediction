justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
this
indictment
form,
mr.
bennett?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
different
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
different
kind
of
a
conspiracy
from
a
conspiracy
to
violate
an
offense
with
some
other
substantive
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wondered
as
you
talk,
i
was
a
little
puzzled.
if
you
got
a
conspiracy
to
violate
a
substantive
statute
then
of
course
you
must
make
out
the
conspiracy
within
the
framework
of
the
substantive
offense.
but
if
this
is
within
the
old
curley
case
doctrine,
namely,
that
this
is
a
conspiracy
to
defraud
the
united
states,
then
you
establish
the
case
--
you
establish
that
there
is
a
defrauding
of
the
government
in
its
governmental
activity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
you
put
barriers
or
you
consciously
defeat
the
endeavors
of
the
government
to
find
out
whether
the
taxpayer
owes
money,
that,
i
take
it,
is
rather
a
conspiracy
to
defraud
the
united
states
in
its
governmental
operations.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
to
prevent
the
relevant
piece
of
evidence
getting
to
the
prosecutor
of
the
treasury
department?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
the
conspiracy
is
a
conspiracy
to
prevent
a
vital
piece
of
evidence
or
information
to
get
to
the
treasury
on
the
basis
of
which
they
will
impose
a
tax.
now,
if
there's
a
necessary
mens
rea,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
conspiracy
to
defraud
the
united
states
in
its
governmental
operation,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now,
you
can
take
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
two
or
more
people
take
measures
to
prevent
enforcement,
the
collection
of
taxes
by
appropriate
means
with
a
willful
purpose
that
the
government
shouldn't
find
out
about
it.
i
think
if
that's
a
conspiracy
to
defraud
the
united
states
in
its
governmental
operations.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
quite
well
aware
--
i'm
quite
well
aware
that
the
curley
case
proved
that,
the
old
morris
case
and
others,
that
that's
a
very
wide
range
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
quite
aware
of
that.
but
it
does
--
it
is
now
--
by
now
abundantly
established,
take
the
people
who
got
information
which
they
shouldn't
have
had
from
the
department
of
agriculture
as
to
the
crop
forecast,
take
all
the
cases
where
there's
a
willful
purpose
to
block
the
governments
doing
that
which
legally
and
wisely
and
orderly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
why
--
the
reason
i
raise
that
is
because
your
minimization
of
--
of
concealment
not
being
important.
justice
felix
frankfurter
wondering
whether
this
is
a
substantive
offense
to
conceal
the
duty
to
report
but
the
other
kind
of
concealment
raises
a
kind
of
different
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
has
a
different
significance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
certainly
a
man
can
--
can
lock
his
lips,
he
has
no
duty
to
go
forward
and
tell
the
government
about
things.
but
there
is
a
duty
which
is
--
which
may
involve
a
crime
not
to
put
blocks
in
the
way
of
the
government
finding
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
suggest
--
but
to
suggest
to
somebody
keep
your
mouth
shut
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
say
you
don't
know
or
you
can't
remember.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
won't
debate
whether
he's
saying
i
don't
know
when
you
do
know
he
is
lying.
it
comes
close
to
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no,
it
doesn't
--
it
isn't
a
new
crime,
it
characterizes
a
conspiracy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
take
it
by
the
charge,
too.
i
take
it
the
conspiracy
defined
a
--
by
the
indictment,
it
must
be
maintained
by
the
evidence.
but
i
take
it
in
the
manner
in
which
what
the
judge
tells
the
jury
is
the
conspiracy,
is
the
kind
of
a
conspiracy
that
must
be
established
because
you
can't
find
that
they
may
have
found
some
other
conspiracy
have
it
been
put
to
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
since
you
have
limited
time,
would
you
--
i
hope
it
will
--
in
the
contemplation
of
your
argument
that
you
say
appropriate
--
take
appropriate
time
dealing
with
the
raffel
case
which
i
take
it
is
--
is
the
--
is
the
most
important
abstraction
to
your
intention,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
he
will
deal
with
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
i
thought
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
it
destroyed
--
it
affects
all
the
other
--
it
affects
the
other
defendants
because
of
halperin's
sentence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
i'm
sorry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
interrupt
you?
would
you
please
state
all
that
the
judge
has
charged
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
this
subject
matter,
namely,
that
he
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
declined
your
request
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
an
affirmative
charge
that
an
--
that
pleading
the
fifth
amendment
may
be
a
plea
by
an
innocent
man,
he
denied
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
gave
a
--
in
fact
gave
a
charge
that
they're
not
to
have
counted
against
him?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
may
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
a
fair
summary
of
what
the
charge
was?
mr.
davis
will
correct
me
if
he
thinks
it's
unfair,
if
it
is
not
accurate.
he
--
he
told
the
jury
that
they
mustn't
--
they
mustn't
draw
anything
against
the
defendant
for
his
failure
to
take
--
to
answer
before
the
grand
jury,
but
he
also
told
him
that
it
was
quite
proper
for
the
government
to
bring
that
fact
out
as
an
impeaching
element
of
his
credibility.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
also
ask
you
about
the
outset.
when,
although,
the
question
of
sufficiency
of
evidence
is
not
before
us,
particularly
with
reference
to
halperin,
if
as
to
him,
there
should
be
found
to
be
error,
what
relation
have
in
due
course
that
if
you
deal
with
that,
what
relation
that
would
have
to
the
--
to
the
verdicts
of
those
not
immediate,
affected
by
the
claim
on
his
behalf?
that
is
a
question,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
--
am
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
answers.
it's
automatic.
i'm
suggesting
--
i'm
asking
whether
it
isn't
for
us
to
--
whether
this
isn't
--
augment
the
necessary
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
merely
the
sufficiency,
but
also
the
--
the
weight,
the
--
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
impressiveness
of
a
proof.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
get
my
bearings,
mr.
davis.
this
is
a
prosecution
under
the
conspiracy
to
defraud
which
is
an
open
and
a
closed
provision
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
the
statute.
so,
the
statute
allows
you
to
--
to
be
as
it
were
wholesale
or
--
or
deal
with
the
course
of
business
and
not
directed
toward
specific
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
number
(2),
the
indictment
of
count
1
is
open
and
not
closed.
and
therefore,
our
question
is
whether
the
charge
orders
extensive
as
the
statute
in
the
indictment
or
whether
the
statute
restricted
the
jury's
consideration
to
a
fraud
in
connection
with
specific
taxpayers
that
appear
in
the
course
of
evidence.
believe
even
after
one
has
answered
that
as
you
indicated
at
the
outset.
now,
there
still
may
be
a
question
not
as
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
but
whether
the
record
sustained
to
that
theory
of
a
prosecution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
of
course.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
justice
harlan
indicated,
you've
got
to
have
an
overt
act
within
the
period.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you've
got
to
have
them
related
to
the
conspiracy
but
not
crimes
themselves.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
where
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
indictment.
that,
you
get
from
the
indictment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
that
that
the
charge
--
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
charge
may
cut
down
the
breadth
of
the
indictment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
the
question
of
reading
the
charge
in
the
light
of
the
theory
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
--
of
submission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
must
be
particular
importance
about
one
at
least
when
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
none
--
none
is
more
important
than
the
other
but
there
must
be
unimportance
to
at
least
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
enough.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
--
i
think
if
you
refer
to
the
argument,
if
you'd
be
good
enough
to
enter
the
chief
justice's
question
a
little
while
ago
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
to
the
precise
overt
acts
on
which
you
rely.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
these
are
essential
one.
what
are
the
statutes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
volume
5,
appendix,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
these
four
who
are
now
petitioners
before
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
--
i
understand.
i'm
quite
and
i
can
quite
follow
you.
i
just
want
to
know
whether
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
did
you
have
four
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
then
how
come
he's
not
in
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
your
--
one
couldn't
find
a
--
renew
of
its
fees
or
adoption.
you
call
it
what
you
will,
for
all
the
petitioners
to
this
single
overt
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
enough
if
that
is
a
dissociated
overt
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then,
i
actually
--
and
that
actually
mean
in
this
overt
act
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
davis,
let's
see
if
you
do
help
me
in
the
thing
that
troubles
me.
suppose
you
have
a
conspiracy
that
is
not
completed
in
the
sense
that
the
object
hasn't
been
accomplished.
conspiracy
to
rob
a
post
office.
and
take
today
as
when
the
conspiracy,
when
the
statute
of
limitations
is
very
short.
i
don't
know
whether
it's
been
extend
generally.what
is
it
now?
justice
felix
frankfurter
five
years.
what
are
the
days
that
one
knew
about
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
--
then
there
was
someone.
there
were
two.
there
were
--
suppose
the
conspiracy
has
not
been
accomplished
within
the
short
statute
of
limitations,
an
extended
conspiracy
to
rob
a
post
office
or
conspiracy
to
counterfeit
a
$10
bills,
you
know.
and
suppose
during
the
period
of
incompletion
while
the
--
the
thing
is
about
two
years
having
to
run,
there's
been
a
--
an
effort
during
those
two
years
to
cover
up
possible
informers.
and
suppose
after
the
two
years,
they,
not
knowing
about
it
or
not
thinking
about
it
or
not
being
reflected
at
all
about
it,
the
statute
of
limitations
still
actually
their
--
in
their
mind
without
any
--
any
kind
of
overt
conduct
with
reference
to
robbing
the
post
office
until
after
they
can
hear
the
witness.
if
--
if
anything
don't
--
we'd
spend
the
night
with
you,
but
don't
think
--
you
maybe,
call
upon
somebody,
may
ask
you,
in
the
future
whether
we
spent
the
night
with
you
(inaudible).
but
here
is
$500,
$200.
here's
a
great
big
tip.
don't
you
tell.
what
would
you
do
with
that
case?
now,
let
me
put
my
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
general
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
if
you
--
as
you
said
very
early,
concealment
is
almost
a
necessary
part
of
every
crime
wherein
it's
covering
your
tracks.
what's
the
matter
with
that
case
compared
to
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
difference
i
want
to
put.
although
in
that
case,
you
have
a
conspiracy
for
a
specific
purpose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
understand
that
if
as
in
the
old
case
of
the
two
gentlemen
engaged
in
partnership
on
a
highway.
that's
the
old
pleading
as
you
put
it.
if
you
had
three
conspirators
say,
let's
go
in
this
business
of
fixing
some
official
in
the
treasury
department
who
are
avoiding
prosecution
for
five
years.
suppose
they
themselves
give.
but
if
and
when
the
law
puts
a
terminus
on
the
--
on
the
prosecution,
haven't
you
got
a
different
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
wasn't
--
i
can
--
i
can
yield
to
that
hypothesis.
but
will
that
be
the
kind
of
a
conspiracy
to
put
to
the
jury
in
the
charge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then
you
don't
need
these
overt
acts.
except
for
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
you
do
not
need
the
overt
acts
to
help
out
the
time
element.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
need
the
overt
acts
it's
because
you
need
an
overt
act
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
you
don't
need
it
for
an
extension
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
said
that
there
are
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
agreement.
the
jury
could
find
in
the
nature
--
in
the
arrangement
of
the
party,
their
relationship
that
the
conspiracy
was
let's
milk
this.
let's
have
this
golden
goose,
as
long
as
bolich
is
the
goose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
that's
a
different
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
can't
prove
the
open-end
merely
by
the
existence
of
an
overt
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
you
give
me
the
impression
that
you
have
to
deal
with
the
suggestion
that
your
answer
made
that
the
statute
of
limitation
in
this
case
is
safe
by
the
overt
acts.
now,
if
you're
right
that
the
conspiracy
was
to
do
this
shabby
business
so
long
as
--
what's
his
name
--
is
--
is
--
then
--
then
you
get
your
statute
of
limitations
on
--
then
you
have
no
problem
of
statute
of
limitations.
you
may
have
a
problem
with
overt
act.
that's
a
different
story.
but
you
don't
prove
you're
within
the
statute
through
the
overt
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
agree
with
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
be
good
enough
to
take
just
a
minute?
i
meant
to
ask
mr.
singer,
if
he
gets
around
to
it.
what
--
what
appeared
before
the
grand
jury,
did
i
understand
correctly
that
the
grand
jury
minutes
were
made
available
all
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean,
with
reference
to
this
matter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
reference
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
reference
to
this
matter?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
would
you
please
tell
what
those
minutes
reveal
as
to
the
--
as
to
the
manner
in
which
the
terms
in
which
he
made
claim
before
the
grand
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
did
--
he
did
make
that
--
he
did
make
that
statement
before
the
grand
jury
as
part
of
the
assertion
of
his
claim.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
appears
that
he
did
give
the
grounds
other
than
merely
reciting
the
formula.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
enough
of
the
whole
problem
where
there
is
inconsistency?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
--
i'm
not
thinking
about
raffel
or
judge
frank.
i
mean,
if
i
have
to
consider
the
problem
anew,
can
i
begin
by,
is
the
case
disposed
of
by
saying
that
a
witness
can
take
an
inconsistent
position
without
having
the
jury
consider
whether
that
inconsistency,
doesn't
make
his
testimony
that's
trusthworthy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
stated
the
problem
that
way
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
i
do
not
think
i
would
be
stating
the
problem
accurately
myself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes.
there's
no
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
problem
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
problem
that
--
that
evaporates
by
its
statement
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
even
more.
i
think,
is
that
an
additional
fact.
namely,
that
he
stated
precisely
the
grounds
why
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
i
tell
you
why
i
make
a
--
i
put
this
problem
to
you?
because
the
government
in
its
brief,
in
its
very
able
brief
by
that
very
able
lawyer,
william
d.
mitchell
in
the
raffel
case
relied
very
heavily
on
commonwealth
against
smith
in
163
massachusetts,
very
heavily.
and
going
to
commonwealth
against
massachusetts
one
finds
that
the
court
there
said
that
defendant
in
such
case
now
says
that
he
is
innocent.
he
formally
did
not
say
that
he
was
innocent,
but
that
he
would
not
answer
lest
he
might
incriminate
himself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
you
may
say
that's
just
legal
stuff.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
does,
to
me,
make
a
difference
as
the
intimation
of
justice
clark's
in
the
question.
here
is
a
fellow
summoned
by
a
subpoena
or
he
had
no
choice.
he
didn't
take
one
position
one
day
and
another
position
in
another.
he'd
been
summoned.
he
had
no
choice
but
to
respond
to
the
subpoena
as
everyone
must
or
he
may
claim
not
to
testify.
but
the
duty
to
respond
is
there
as
marshall
or
even
in
the
case
of
burton
v.
united
states
doesn't
give
a
reason
of
--
for
not
coming.
and
then
he
said,
“i'm
innocent
but
i
won't
talk
to
you
for
these
and
these
reasons.”
now,
i
say
to
you,
you
can't
ask
that
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
merely
by
saying,
“of
course,
you
can
impeach
him
with
this
for
contradictory
statements.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
very
impressive
in
your
citations.
all
i
suggest
to
you
when
i
go
to
the
merits
of
the
raffel
case
and
find
that
justice
stone
and
this
court
relied
heavily
on
a
case
that
is
distinguishable,
i
begin
to
reconsider
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
justice
stone
relied
on
this
--
that
--
that
--
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
i'd
say
that
if
--
if
the
fellow
relies
on
an
argument
that
i
don't
think
is
good,
this
result
is
no
better
than
the
argument
on
which
he
relies.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
--
i
understand.
that's
right
--
but
i
--
that's
why
i
say
that
the
government
in
it's
brief
--
i
don't
mean
to
throw
estoppel
about
it.
the
government
in
its
brief
relied
more
heavily,
i
think,
on
that
than
any
other
case
which
they
brought
to
the
court's
attention.
that's
a
fair
statement,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
doesn't
make.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
before
--
before
the
trial
judge,
mr.
davis,
the
grand
jury
testimony
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
halperin
on
this
--
on
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
must
have
been
before
the
trial
court,
of
course.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
--
could
you
identify
--
are
--are
there
many
exhibits
or
this
is
the
only
one
that's
lodged
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
identify
that
one
so
that
one
wouldn't
have
to
go
through
everything?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
just
that
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
court
exhibit
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you
very
much.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
the
one
that
deals
with
this
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
it
isn't
here,
could
--
could
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
--
they
got
through
the
solicitor
general's
office?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
--
where
is
--
would
you
--
could
you
without
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
delay
give
me
a
reference
to
everything
that
the
trial
court
said
to
the
jury
on
this
subject.
justice
felix
frankfurter
everything.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
what
mr.
davis
referred
to
the
government's
brief?
is
that
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
17
and
18.
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
the
--
the
denial
of
the
request
you
made
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
the
--
the
charge
that
ran
for
a
charge,
the
defendant,
the
--
the
name
halperin
was
never
used.
so
that
the
context
must
have
showed
they
refer
to
halperin.
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
is
this
the
evidence
of
a
defendant's
privacy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
the
next
page,
the
defendant
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
and
halperin?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
--
i
understand.
maybe
you
didn't
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
was
the
--
by
dealing
with
the
charge,
will
i
see
that
he's
been
talking
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
he's
referring
to
halperin's
evidence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
--
that
isn't
the
--
that
isn't
the
innuendo
of
my
question,
quite
the
opposite.
namely,
was
he
referring
to
evidence
about
halperin
but
did
not
put
the
jury
the
evidence
that
he
asserted
his
privilege
as
an
innocent
man?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
did
--
did
he
summarize
--
did
he
purport
in
--
in
charging
the
jury
just
without
binding
him
in
court
to
talk
about
evidence
pertaining
to
halperin?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
it?
i
want
a
reference
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suggest
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
i'll
suggest
--
i
should
have
suggested
this
to
mr.
davis.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
makes
reference
to
halperin's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
it
--
by
which
--
by
way
of
enlightening
the
jury
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
talks
about
this
and
doesn't
refer
to
the
fact
that
he
claimed
innocence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
you
think
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
it?
it
was
an
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
in
fact
--
in
fact,
do
i
--
might
infer
from
what
you've
just
said
that
he
was
asked
questions
and
answered
questions
not
remotely
pertaining
to
himself,
and
therefore,
was
in
a
split
capacity
of
witness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
the
--
the
fact
that
he
was
called
there
five
times,
isn't
very
significant,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
he
was
called
as
a
witness
about
things
wholly
remote
from
himself,
testified.but
then
he
was
asked
a
question
about
himself
and
he
invoked
the
amendment.
then
he
was
called
again
and
they
again
and
again
asked
him
and
he
again
and
again
said,
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand
that
if
--
if
a
thing
is
an
exhibit
in
the
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
isn't
in
a
secret
to
a
counsel
in
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
courts
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
doesn't
matter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know,
but
i
want
to
know
what
the
nature
of
this
document
is
if
i
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
saying,
it's
either
in
the
case
or
it
isn't
in
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
isn't
in
the
case,
i
have
no
business
to
see
it.
if
it
is,
it
couldn't
be
a
secret
before
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
court
see
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
--
your
own
statement
to
my
mind
presents
the
different
problems
and
the
one
that
is
implied
in
your
remarks
about
a
minute.
namely,
if
you
got
in
this,
if
you
got
a
person
who
was
--
who
may
be
an
important
witness
on
matters
not
related
to
his
own
potential
criminality
but
also
may
be
found
to
be
part
of
a
conspiracy,
the
government
had
today,
a
difficult
choice,
is
confronted
with
a
difficult
problem
in
the
administration
of
justice
and
i
should
think
it
would
be
extra
austere
to
say
that
because
he
may
claim
the
privileges
himself,
the
administration
of
justice
must
deny
itself
the
testimony
unrelated
to
himself
which
he's
able
to
furnish.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
if
he
answered
any
as
to
which
he
pled
--
could
plead
the
privilege,
then
he
certainly
opens
the
door.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
short
answer
to
my
question
is
that
mr.
davis
did
not,
as
i
understood
him,
say
that
in
the
--
that
in
his
appearance
before
the
grand
jury,
he
in
fact
waived
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this
question
before
you
sit
down.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
it's
--
for
me,
important.
as
counsel
for
halperin,
departing
from
this
question
but
relating
to
it,
quite
seriously.
assume
you're
right
--
assume
your
right,
does
the
testimony
as
to
halperin,
is
the
testimony
or
the
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
halperin
seriously
or
weightily
or
relevantly
different
from,
in
weight,
from
that
to
which
supports
the
verdict
of
the
other
defendants?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
decision,
of
course,
doesn't
--
i
meant
to
look
at
the
remarks.
what
does
counselman
and
hitchcock
say
by
way
of
thought
about
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
wasn't
a
grand
jury
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
would
you
--
how
do
you
formulate
this
question?
primary
target
isn't
what
i
would
call
a
term
of
art.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
was
the
way
it
was
put
to
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
that
argument
can
carry
you
very
far
mr.
davis
because
i'm
sure
you
know
the
first
place
has
to
be
taken
care
of
by
a
rule
that
if
a
man
wants
to
appeal,
he
should
be
allowed
to
do
so.
but
in
the
second
place,
unless,
prosecuted,
they
had
much
changed
their
minds
or
their
attitudes
since
i
knew
about
it,
that's
at
firsthand,
and
on
the
whole,
they
refused
to
give
people
who
want
to
go
before
the
grand
jury
to
prove
themselves
innocent,
a
chance
to
go
as
often
as
they
let
come.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
grand
jury
is
a
very
responsive
and
the
rest
of
the
prosecutors
before
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
--
is
the
argument
one
of
constitutionality
or
desirable
procedure
in
administration
of
criminal
justice
in
the
federal
courts
which
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
even
is
if
you
don't
make
it
a
constitutional
limitation,
it
might
be
made
a
procedure
of
limitation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
this
is
an
--
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
that
because
as
i
understand
the
--
the
use
that
was
made
of
his
failure
--
of
his
claim
of
privilege
before
the
grand
jury,
of
course,
that
that
fact
in
--
in
and
of
itself
cast
doubt
upon
the
trustworthiness
of
answers
he
gave
to
wholly
to
--
to
whatever
questions
he
gave
answers
to.
in
other
words
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
fact
that
he
now
took
the
stand
and
glibly
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
preventatively
answered
should
lead
the
jury
the
question
whether
his
answers
are
truthful
because
before
the
grand
jury,
he
wouldn't
answer
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
i
don't
think
you
can
quite
say
that
what
he
was
cross-examined
on
related
to
questions
that
you'd
answered
on
is
direct.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
--
you
disturb
me
intellectually
i
mean.
i
don't
understand
this.
he
couldn't
have
waived
in
what
he
did
before
the
grand
jury.
otherwise,
you
would
be
here
and
saying
whatever
maybe
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
right
or
wrong.
rogers
takes
care
of
the
(inaudible)
for
the
part
of
their
goal,
part
of
the
distance
in
testifying
and
that
point
they
don't
know
how
to
stop
the
fifth
amendment.
you
can't
do
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
don't
raise
--
you
don't
make
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
the
issue
is
quite
clear
cut
that
he
did
have
or
recognized
and
acknowledged
and
supported
--
he
didn't
make
an
exercise
of
his
privilege
before
the
grand
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
short,
he
didn't
testify
within
the
given
territory.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
direct,
he
was
asked
questions
about
which
he
refused
to
testify.
justice
felix
frankfurter
questions
about
which
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
before
the
grand
jury
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
he
refused
to
testify.
the
government
then
wants
to
undercut
any
belief
in
the
jury
of
the
truthfulness
of
his
answer
by
saying,
well,
why
didn't
you
open
your
mouth
before
the
grand
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
davis,
i
like
to
put
to
you
another
--
the
relations
to
raffel.
i
myself
could
find
a
difference
in
this
case
in
raffel
and
i
could
find
a
difference
that
would
require
me
not
at
all
to
overrule
raffel,
but
may
lead
me
not
to
extend
raffel.
and
i
want
to
put
to
you
on
other
argument
in
raffel's
opinion
which
doesn't
commended
the
opinions
of
this
with
terrific
force.
namely,
the
suggestion
was
made
in
that
opinion
that
he
might
as
well
look
at
facts
in
the
face
that
we
know
there
is
a
pressure
on
the
jury
to
take
it
into
account
for
the
fellow
who
doesn't
take
the
witness
stand.
now,
i
say
that
that's
an
inadmissible
piece
of
psychological
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
court,
certainly
in
the
line
of
the
bruno
decision
in
308
in
which
we
assert
the
failure
to
give
such
a
charge
can't
be
excused
on
the
fact
that
oh,
well,
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
--
such
jurors
anyhow,
they
privately
take
it
against
the
fellow.
but
we
can't
make
such
psychological,
the
dogmatic
psychological
observation
and
rest
the
rule
of
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
only
that,
but
you
not
only
can
draw
any
inference
of
guilt
but
you
must
affirmatively
tell
the
jury
not
to
run
the
assumption
that
they
would
try
to
discipline
their
minds.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
in
the
raffel
case,
the
contrary
assumption
was
made
--
one
of
the
arguments
in
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
saying
this
would
tell
you
to
--
against
you
in
this
case
on
that
suggestion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
trying
to
--
it's
relevant
to
a
consideration
of
how
far
one
will
take
raffel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
he
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
know
what
inference
you
draw
from
that.
i
should
think
it's
--
it's
weaker
than
the
raffel
situation
where
he
was
the
master
of
his
own
faith.
on
the
first
trial,
he
chose
not
to
be
a
witness
with
all
the
protection,
with
all
the
kind
of
plea
of
--
of
safeguards
that
the
law
affords
at
a
trial.
he
chose
not
to
--
not
to
appear
as
a
witness
in
the
--
in
this
case.
for
those
subpoenaed,
he
has
no
choice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
in
the
first
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
didn't
think
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no
but
--
but
a
defendant
certainly
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
thinks
whether
he
should
take
the
witness
stand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
read
it
only
this
morning
in
connection
with
that,
the
famous
case
going
on
in
london
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
long
--
little
announcement
by
counsel
and
long
consideration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
require
a
murder
case
for
a
defendant
and
his
counsel
to
would
be
thinking
whether
he
should
take
the
witness
stand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
on
page

mr.
davis,
i
respectfully
accept
your
honor's
reference
to
the
testimonies
of
halperin,
the
cross-examination
of
halperin
in
connection
with
his
grand
jury
testimony
attempted
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
respectfully
accept
to
stipulate
as
your
honors'
language
where
your
honors
said
it
would
be
proper
for
the
government
to
interrogate
halperin.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
respectfully
accept
your
honors'
failure
so
i
should
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
next
quote,
a
little
down.
i
should
think
enough
exceptions
were
taken.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
government
wouldn't
be
sticky
about
that.
