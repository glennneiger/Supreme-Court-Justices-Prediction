chief

earl
warren
of
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
--
oh
pardon
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
government's
view,
when
did
the
conspiracy
end?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
what
was
that
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
anyway
you
want
to.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
davis,
i'm
--
i'm
not
quite
clear
about
your
answer
to
justice
frankfurter
and
about
the
--
this
next
to
the
last
overt
act
that
you
--
you
spoke
of
where
you
said
it
only
--
only
applied
to
a
certain
number
of
the
defendants,
not
--
not
the
rest
of
them.
now,
i
hope
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
probably
misunderstood
you.
would
you
mind
telling
me
just
what
you
did
say
about
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
they
all
are
bound
by
this
act
to
be
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
suppose
in
your
case
here,
the
only
act
that
you
have
--
overt
act
that
you
have
within
the
statute
of
limitations
is
an
act
of
the
subornation
of
perjury
at
the
time
of
the
grand
jury
investigation
to
conceal
the
guilt
of
this
people.
would
that
keep
it
alive?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
well,
just
take,
would
it
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
whether
it
was
five
or
ten
or
twenty
five
years
thereafter.
chief
justice
earl
warren
after
your
last
overt
act
of
--
of
the
conspiracy.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
there
was
--
there
was
four
years.
unless
you
have
--
unless
you
take
into
consideration
this
acts
of
concealment.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
suppose
it
was
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
suppose
it
was
five
years
more
than
that.
and
they
--
they
still
had
--
had
the
thought
in
mind
of
concealing
their
crime
if
they
--
if
they
testified.
i
mean
if
subornation
of
perjury
was
committed.
and
that
was
the
only
overt
act
you
have
within
the
statute
of
limitations.
you
--
you
think
that
it
would
have
kept
alive
the
whole
conspiracy.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
you
said
in
answer
to
one
of
the
justices
that
the
--
that
all
of
the
six
overt
acts
that
occurred
within
the
statute
of
limitations
had
to
do
with
concealment.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
if
we
were
to
eliminate
from
the
record
the
six
overt
acts
having
to
do
with
concealment,
the
acts
that
bring
it
within
the
statute
of
limitations,
would
there
be
sufficient
in
the
record
to
establish
that
--
that
part
of
the
conspiracy,
which
has
to
do
with
concealment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no.
let's
now
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
we
eliminate
from
the
case
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
entirely.
chief
justice
earl
warren
these
--
these
six
acts.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
enough
remaining
in
the
record
to
establish
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
this
conspiracy
was
concealment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
what
just
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
that
a
common
thing
in
the
bank,
any
bank
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
that
a
normal
thing
in
any
corruption
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
an
act
of
that
kind
would
--
would
continue
the
conspiracy
at
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
we've
--
we've
taken
a
great
deal
of
your
time
on
questions.
and
i
know
you
want
to
get
to
the
fifth
amendment
issue.
we'll
give
you
ten
minutes
more
in
which
to
discuss
that
matter,
if
you
want.
and,
of
course,
we
give
the
counsel
also
ten
minutes
more.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
--
you
couldn't
it
help.
you
couldn't
help
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
[laughs]
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
you
do
that
for
us,
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
singer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
you
have
10
minutes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
davis,
before
you
get
away
from
that,
i
assume
that
--
that
the
government
didn't
know
that
this
man
was
to
be
a
defendant
and
that
they
called
him
as
they
would
in
any
other
witness
that
he
did
claim
his
privilege
as
he
did
here.
would
that
fact
--
the
fact
that
they
didn't
know
he
was
going
to
be
a
defendant
make
any
difference
in
--
in
whether
they
could
use
that
against
him
as
to
his
credibility
on
the
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
right,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thus,
your
position
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
whether
the
government
brought
him
there
as
a
prospect
to
defendant
or
whether
they
brought
him
there
merely
as
a
witness.
