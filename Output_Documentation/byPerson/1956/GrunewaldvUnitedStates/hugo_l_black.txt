they
relate

so-called
“tax

relate

so-called
“concealment”?

it
might
make
it
two,
might
it
not?
justice

it
might
make
it
two
conspiracies,
might
it
not?
justice
hugo

if
your
--
if
your
argument
is
correct
up
to
date,
it
sounds
to
me
like
it
will
be
bound
to
be
two.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
think
--
if
you're
saying
if
you
had
enough
charge
in
there
to
support
a
conspiracy
to
conceal
and
to
make
the
--
to
defraud
the
government
by
concealing
and
then
it
says
--
justice
frankfurter
referred
to
this
governmental
operation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
problem
now
is
what
i
really
wanted
you
to
discuss
is
this.
you
raise
it.
you
raised
in
my
mind
by
your
suggestion.
you
have
clearly
a
charge
of
a
so-called
“tax
fixing
conspiracy”.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
a
conspiracy
to
fix
taxes.
then
you
have
also,
as
i
understand,
you
predict
clearly
a
charge
of
a
conspiracy
to
conceal
what
--
what
is
done.
and
to
defeat
the
government
by
concealing,
either
--
either
or
both
of
those,
i
suppose,
would
constitute
a
single
--
could
constitute
a
single
conspiracy.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i'm
wondering
is
if
you
can
if
the
government
can
by
attaching
the
separate
charge
of
conspiracy
to
a
separate
charge.
i
mean,
conspiracy
to
conceal
separate
conspiracy
to
fix
taxes.
if
they
can
by
that
means
interminably
continue
the
--
so
that
the
thing
--
so
that
there
can
never
be
a
statute
of
limitation
to
their
function.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

--
based
from
what
you
said
that
if
you
had
charged
--
you've
got
enough
charge
in
here,
so
that
you
can
charge
it
in
two
separate
counts,
you
would
have
had
one,
a
conspiracy
to
fix
taxes.
and
secondly,
the
conspiracy
to
conceal
from
the
government
both
either
of
which
would
be
enough
to
condemn.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
but
what
i
--
i'm
asking
you,
what
--
what
bothers
me
and
that
is
this.
if
that'd
be
true
and
i
understood
from
you
that
your
evidence
insofar
as
overt
act
show,
shows
no
overt
act
at
all
with
reference
to
the
fixing
of
taxes
which
is
within
the
statute
of
limitations.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
would
prolong
the
life
of
this
charge
merely
by
--
by
the
overt
act
with
reference
to
the
other.
which
could
have
been
charged
in
a
separate
count
and
kept
alive
and
the
man
could
have
been
tried
for
conspiracy
to
conceal,
i
suppose.

overt
acts
that
you're

occurred.
justice

i

the

of

was
there
any
evidence

continued

a

do
the

things
by
which
you'd

let
me
see
if
i
understand
you.
as
you
were
saying
that
your
indictment
charge
and
the
court
charge
as
used,
these
and
these
people
had
conspired
to
do
at
least
two
things.
one,
to
have
a
ring
to
fix
taxes
if
they
keep
doing
that.

the
other
to

that
