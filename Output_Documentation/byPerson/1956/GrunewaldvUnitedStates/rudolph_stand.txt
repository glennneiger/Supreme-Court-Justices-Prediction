mr.
rudolph
stand
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
petitioner
bolich,
former
assistant
commissioner
of
internal
revenue,
who
was
convicted
together
with
grunewald
and
halperin
on
a
charge
of
conspiracy
to
defraud
the
united
states
in
violation
of
the
general
conspiracy
statute.
and
--
and
bolich
alone
was
also
convicted
on
count
2
of
this
seven
count
indictment
on
a
charge
of
a
conspiracy
under
the
internal
revenue
law,
section
4047
subdivision
(e)
(4),
which
by
its
very
terms
applies
specifically
to
revenue
officers
and
agents.
when
this
case
came
on
for
review
before
the
court
of
appeals,
they
unanimously
affirmed
the
judgment
of
conviction
was
against
bolich,
who
was
sentenced
to
five
years
imprisonment
and
fined
$10,000
on
count
1,
and
was
also
sentenced
to
three
years
imprisonment
on
count
2
with
a
fine
of
$5000
of
--
for
his
conviction
on
that
offense.
the
court
of
appeals
originally
affirmed
that
conviction
by
a
divided
court,
the
late
judge
frank
dissenting
solely
as
against
halperin
on
constitutional
grounds
which
will
be
argued
by
mr.
singer
who
represents
him,
and
on
petitions
for
rehearing
presented
by
all
the
petitioners
who
are
now
before
this
court.
that
application
was
denied
with
judge
frank
this
time
extending
his
dissent
to
include
all
defendants.
and
in
such
dissent
and
in
the
course
of
his
opinion,
he
voted
to
grant
each
of
the
defendants
a
new
trial
upon
the
ground
that
the
trial
court
committed
serious
error
in
its
charge
with
respect
to
the
vital
question
involved
in
this
case,
namely,
the
application
of
the
three-year
statute
of
limitations.
since
there
are
three
petitioners
before
this
court
and
since
mr.
bennett
has
covered
as
rapidly
as
he
could
the
question
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
i
will
confine
my
argument
within
the
short
time
alloted
to
me
to
the
question
of
the
multiplicity
--
the
multiplicity
of
conspiracies
here
involved
and
very
briefly
to
the
constitutional
question
which
affects
the
petitioner
halperin
and
which
both
petitioners
grunewald
and
bolich
contend
likewise
affected
them
in
the
most
serious
degree
because
halperin
was
the
only
witness
called
on
behalf
of
these
petitioners.
and
when
his
testimony
was
destroyed
by
the
court's
charge
to
the
jury
and
which
he
stated
that
they
had
the
right
to
--
to
consider
adversely
halperin's
credibility
because
he
had
chosen
to
rely
upon
his
constitutional
rights
by
such
a
charge
which
was
most
vigorously
and
persistently
protested
by
each
and
every
counsel,
he
thereby
destroying,
not
only
the
defense
of
halperin,
an
attorney
of
over
40
years
practice
at
the
bar
but
destroyed
and
demolished
completely
the
defense
of
the
other
two
petitioners.
mr.
rudolph
stand
well,
the
--
no,
that
--
the
raffel
case
is
the
problem
which
mr.
singer
will
deal
with.
mr.
rudolph
stand
yes.
mr.
rudolph
stand
i
represent
the
petitioner
--
mr.
rudolph
stand
--
bolich.
no,
but
in
view
with
my
--
of
--
mr.
rudolph
stand
yes,
but
that
subject
will
be
elaborated
--
mr.
rudolph
stand
--
and
dealt
with
--
mr.
rudolph
stand
--
in
two
phases
by
my
learned
friend
mr.
singer.
i
will
get
right
down
to
the
rock
bottom
question
here
involved
that
i'm
going
to
argue
matters
that
question
of
multiplicity
of
conspiracies.
i
will
of
necessity
just
have
to
touch
in
broadest
outline
some
of
the
facts
with
respect
to
bolich
because
in
a
large
measure
his
case
stands
on
a
different
footing
from
that
of
the
other
petitioners.
bolich
was
assistant
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
during
the
period
involved
in
this
prosecution
and
i'm
speaking
now
of
1948.
he
was
the
special
agent
in
charge
of
the
four
bureau
in
the
city
of
new
york.
as
mr.
bennett
pointed
out,
two
companies
were
under
investigation
by
the
federal
authorities,
the
patullo
modes
company
which
was
a
dress
manufacturing
concern
and
the
gotham
beef
company
which
was
engaged
in
business
in
new
york
city.
both
of
these
corporations
who
were
in
hot
water,
who
were
in
difficulties
with
the
government
were
represented
by
a
co-conspirator
and
a
named
defendant
in
this
indictment
which
case
was
severed
from
that
of
the
petitioners
before
this
court.
they
were
the
clients
of
a
man
named
davis,
who
was
a
member
of
the
law
affirm
of
davis
and
schopick,
and
who
had
in
their
employ
a
man
named
hoffman
who
was
a
stirrer
for
this
law
affirm
and
although
not
a
lawyer
shared
a
major
portion
of
the
income
of
these
attorneys.
the
case
of
the
gotham
beef
company
came
to
special
agent
bolich's
attention
in
1948
when
davis,
representing
himself
to
be
their
attorney,
called
on
this
official
at
whose
duty
it
was
to
receive
taxpayers,
whose
duty
it
was
to
receive
any
attorney
representing
taxpayers
and
davis
represented
to
bolich
that
there
was
no
tax
evasion
affecting
his
client.
whereupon
bolich,
the
petitioner
said,
"who
is
the
conferee
in
charge
with
this
investigation?"
and
he
was
told
that
it
was
a
man
named
kuehl.
whereupon,
bolich
said,
"go
to
the
conferee,
submit
what
facts
you
have
and
the
matter
will
take
its
regular
course."
of
course,
i
don't
want
to
present
merely
one
side
of
this
picture.
the
government
contends
that
bolich
was
perhaps
influenced
in
his
conduct
in
connection
with
the
gotham
case
because
davis
had
claimed
he
had
difficulty
in
contacting
mr.
bolich,
that
whenever
he
tried
to
phone
him
he
was
busily
engaged
either
on
the
telephone
or
in
conference
with
the
treasury
department
officials.
but
when
the
petitioners
halperin
and
grunewald
got
into
the
picture,
a
conference
was
speedily
arranged
within
the
course
of
a
few
days.
i
notice
the
--
the
flash
so
i'll
have
to
cutdown
on
the
--
the
outline
of
my
facts,
but
i
will
sum
up
the
gotham
case.
the
record
is
--
is
unchallenged
that
kuehl
recommended
no
prosecution
in
the
gotham
case.
it
was
confirmed
by
baradel,
a
respected
official
who
was
30
years
in
the
--
in
the
internal
revenue
service.
and
going
to
the
patullo
case
which
i
can
only
touch
on
in
a
moment,
in
that
case
baradel
made
a
recommendation
that
there
wasn't
--
that
there'd
be
no
prosecution
after
he
had
ascertained
from
commissioner
bolich,
that
bolich
had
agreed
with
attorneys
representing
these
--
these
taxpayers,
that
if
they
made
full
--
if
they
had
shown
full
cooperation
to
the
government
that
the
case
could
be
--
would
be
given
a
non-prosecution
consideration.
both
kuehl
and
both
baradel
said
that
their
judgment
was
not
in
anyway
influenced
by
bolich.
now,
in
this
case,
there
were
four
volumes
of
testimony
covering
over
1900
pages
with
bolich's
name
not
even
mentioned
accepting
--
by
one
witness
who
gave
his
--
a
testimony
regarding
the
gotham
case.
there
were
a
series
--
all
the
list
indictment
charged
one
long
continuing
conspiracy
with
this
element
of
concealment
which
eventually
was
resulted
in
the
trial
court
directing
an
acquittal
as
to
counts
5,
6,
and
7
with
respect
to
bolich
and
grunewald.
it
appeared
beyond
any
question
from
the
evidence
that
there
were
a
series
of
separate
independent
wholly
unrelated
transactions.
incidentally,
on
the
count
2,
there
were
two
officials
--
two
revenue
agents,
steinberg
and
scherm,
who
were
charged
with
having
acted
in
concert
with
bolich
under
count
2,
which
the
court
of
appeals
said
was
substantially
the
same
as
count
1.
and
therefore,
vacated
the
fine
imposed
but
held
that
there
was
no
prejudice
because
the
prison
sentence
is
ran
concurrently.
we
have
evidence
of
all
these
transactions,
where
all
of
which
went
in
on
the
theory
of
that
their
declarations
would
be
admissible
against
the
petitioner
bolich.
and
we
claim
without
going
into
details
that
our
case
falls
directly
within
the
principles
of
the
kotteakos
case.
both
the
judges
charge
in
the
kotteakos
case
and
the
charge
in
this
case
stated
as
a
matter
of
law
that
there
was
one
single
conspiracy.
when
your
honors
examine
this
record,
you'll
find
at
least
eight
or
nine
separate
conspiracies
which
by
the
very
nature
in
a
seven
weeks
trial
so
overwhelmed
less
petition
of
bolich,
they
could
not
have
been
--
could
not
have
received
a
fair
trial
in
this
case.
the
courts
have
repeatedly
been
concerned
with
the
--
with
the
abuse
of
the
conspiracy
statute
and
especially
where
a
single
charge
is
made
and
more
than
one
charge
is
proven.
