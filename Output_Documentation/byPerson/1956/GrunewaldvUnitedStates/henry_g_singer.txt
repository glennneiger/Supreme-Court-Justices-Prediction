mr.
henry
g.
singer
i
shall
approach
directly
in
this
constitutional
question
in
--
in
the
raffel
case.
but
briefly
before
i
go
and
just
for
two
minutes
let
me
give
you
the
setting
in
which
it
occurred.
halperin
who
was
convicted
here
was
called
before
a
grand
jury,
he
was
lawyer.
he
was
called
before
a
grand
jury
in
1952,
before
your
honors
had
decided
the
ullmann,
quinn,
emspak
cases.
and
when
he
went
before
that
grand
jury,
he
was
questioned
about
the
incidence
which
become
or
later
became
a
part
of
the
indictment
and
part
of
the
trial.
and
for
the
first
time
that
i
can
find
in
recorded
cases,
a
defendant
told
the
grand
jury,
mr.
halperin,
that
he
refused
to
answer
but
that
he
was
innocent.
i
want
that
to
remain
because
that's
in
the
record.
he
also
told
the
grand
jury
and
not
only
would
he
refuse
to
answer
on
the
ground
under
the
fifth
amendment
but
because
two,
he
was
acting
on
the
advice
of
his
counsel.
three,
he
had
no
right
to
cross-examine
the
witnesses.
and
four,
he
was
being
--
being
deprived
of
the
right
to
be
confronted
by
the
witnesses.
and
so
much
for
that
until
we
come
to
the
trial,
it
took
place
some
three
years
later
almost
until
today.
and
now
halperin
fulfilled
the
promise
that
he
had
made
in
the
grand
jury
when
he
said
he
was
innocent.
that
he
had
--
didn't
have
the
right
to
cross-examine
the
witnesses
or
be
confronted
by
him
or
have
the
assistance
of
counsel.
he
took
the
stand
and
he
was
the
only
one
of
the
petitioners
who
did
and
proved
his
innocence
to
the
point
at
least
where
judge
frank
in
his
dissenting
opinion
said
there
was
sufficient
--
what
i
--
his
exact
words
are
quoted
there
was
sufficient
to
warrant
the
jury
acquitting
halperin.
now,
the
cross-examination
now
started
by
the
government
after
the
direct
was
completed
and
halperin
was
asked
whether
or
not
he
had
refused
to
answer
before
the
grand
jury
some
three
years
before.
and
he
said
he
had
over
objection,
exception
in
the
various
motion.
well,
he
moved
for
a
mistrial,
we
did
everything
he
could
legally
do
to
stop
the
proceeding.
the
court
took
the
position
that
under
the
raffel
case
and
under
this
court's
denial
of
certiorari
which
of
course
was
never
an
authority,
that
the
--
the
district
attorney
had
a
right
to
bring
out
the
denial,
the
refusal
to
answer
on
the
very
minute
with
an
inconsistent
statement.
and
i
want
to
take
that
problem
first
because
that's
the
serious
problem,
first
in
the
point
of
cross-examination
before
we
even
discuss
the
constitutional
question.
now,
i
say
to
your
honors
directly,
what's
inconsistent
about
a
man
telling
a
grand
jury
he's
innocent
and
telling
a
trial
jury
he's
innocent?
merely
because
--
now,
this
was
the
classic
example
and
even
judge
--
and
the
--
judge
medina
in
the
prevailing
opinion
pointed
out
that
halperin
had
told
the
grand
jury
he
was
innocent
and
the
other
things
i
told.
of
course
the
direct
examination
didn't
disclose
it.
and
i
couldn't
bring
it
out
until
i
could
get
possession
of
the
grand
jury
minutes
during
the
recess
or
overnight
to
show
that
halperin
had
--
that
the
statements
weren't
inconsistent.
that
he
had
said
to
the
jury
below,
the
grand
jury
that
he
was
innocent
and
that
there
was
no
difference
in
his
testimony.
now,
the
theory
of
inconsistency
having
been
dissipated,
there
was
no
basis
for
asking
a
witness
a
prior
statement
which
was
consistent
that
didn't
exist.
and
so,
the
government
comes
before
you
know
and
says,
"we
have
a
little
different
bearing,
we
say
we
don't
know
whether
it's
consistent
or
inconsistent
but
we
will
go
to
the
extent."
then
this
--
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
reply
brief
would
say
there's
a
difference
between
the
two.
in
the
one
place,
he
refused
to
answer,
of
course
they
leave
out
the
words
saying
he
was
innocent
and
arrested
but
in
this
place
he
didn't.
i
say
that's
hornbook
law
that
it
isn't
the
difference
that
justifies
cross-examination,
its
inconsistency.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
say
to
your
honors
directly
that
if
halperin
had
not
testified
before
the
district
court
when
he
was
tried
under
the
indictment,
he
would
then
have
been
inconsistent.
because
to
claim
your
innocence
in
one
place
and
then
refuse
to
testify
later
when
you
have
a
fair
chance
represented
by
counsel
with
a
judge
present,
that
might
then
have
been
inconsistent
but
of
course
halperin
did
testify.
and
so
now,
we're
going
--
and
we
--
if
we
will
--
we
look
at
the
raffel
case
and
see
first
whether
it
even
applies
to
this
situation.
raffel
at
his
first
trial
--
i
don't
want
to
go
into
the
facts,
i
think
your
honors
are
all
familiar
with
it,
didn't
testify
at
all
because
there
was
some
claim
by
some
federal
agent
that
raffel
had
made
an
admission.
at
the
--
and
there
was
a
disagreement
at
the
second
trial
raffel
did
testify.
and
then
he
was
asked
whether
or
not
he
had
testified
at
the
first
trial,
objection
finally
ordered
to
say
that
he
did.
now,
when
the
matter
came
to
this
court
and
mr.
justice
stone
wrote
on
it,
he
wrote
on
a
certified
question
by
the
old
then
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
he
said
that
it
was
all
right
to
ask
him.
but
there
was
no
claim
made
at
that
trial,
no
charge
in
the
raffel
case
that
i
can
find
in
the
record,
although
judge
stone
speaks
of
it
as
a
reason
for
something.
if
your
credibility
--
the
witness'
credibility
could
be
judged
on
the
basis
of
his
refusal
to
testify
ones
in
his
present
testimony.
but
the
key
to
the
whole
point
comes
to
this
very
--
the
number
of
the
question.
judge
stone
says
that
the
right
to
refuse
to
answer
is
a
voluntary
one
that
goes
to
the
witness
and
is
his
to
claim
or
to
reject.
that
is
not
our
case.
and
rapidly,
let
me
show
you
why
it
isn't.
when
halperin
was
called
before
the
grand
jury
as
a
witness,
he
wasn't
like
raffel
who
had
the
choice
not
to
take
the
stand,
nobody
could
comment
on
it,
the
court
would
have
to
tell
the
jury
that
his
failure
to
testify
shouldn't
be
considered.
oh,
no,
halperin
was
by
the
very
government
itself
put
into
the
position
where
he
could
not
voluntarily
make
the
choice
of
testifying
or
not
testifying,
he
was
called,
he
was
sworn,
he
was
asked
and
then
it
was
the
government
compelled
him.
so
that
when
he
took
the
--
took
the
stand
on
his
own
trial,
he
was
in
quite
a
different
position
than
raffel.
raffel,
as
i
said
before
like
any
defendant,
didn't
have
to
testify,
the
government
forced
halperin
as
a
witness
and
when
they
did
it
they
might
just
as
well
have
said,
"you,
mr.
halperin,
already
witnessed
before
a
grand
jury.
forget
your
constitutional
privilege
because
the
moment
we
decide
not
to
give
it,
we'll
call
you
before
a
grand
jury,
have
and
put
you
in
a
position
where
every
lawyer
with
any
reason
or
--
or
rationale
of
logical
thought,"
would
say
to
him,
"don't
answer
any
questions
if
you
can
possibly
avoid
them."
and
now
they
say,
"when
you
come
to
court
and
you
do
testify
in
an
open
trial,
we're
going
to
tell
the
jury
that
before
they
can
judge
the
truthfulness
of
what
you
say
on
this
subject,
we
ask
you
to
consider
the
fact
that
you,
mr.
witness
or
mr.
defendant,
have
refused
to
answer
the
same
question
before
a
grand
jury."
and
i
say
that
this
court
has
gotten
away
long
ago
from
the
raffel
case,
you
first
did
it
in
the
johnson
case.
it
seems
to
me
as
clear
as
crystal
that
you
said
or
maybe
you
didn't
say
directly
that
the
raffel
case
was
wrong
but
you
certainly
wouldn't
apply
it
to
johnson,
but
the
case
was
affirmed
because
his
counsel
had
waived
all
of
the
objections.
then
you
had
--
had
it
in
four
cases
running
together
emspak,
ullmann,
slochower
and
quinn.
and
there
each
time
this
court
said
that
it
was
not
any
reflection
with
respect
to
guilt
or
innocence
for
a
man
to
plea
the
fifth
amendment.
and
although
your
honors
had
not
yet
decided
the
ullmann
case
and
the
slochower
case
when
this
case
was
tried,
we
ask
the
court
below
to
charge
the
jury
that
an
innocent
man
might
honestly
claim
the
privileges
of
the
fifth
amendment.
now,
it's
strange
but
perhaps
lawyers
do
think
as
this
court
ultimately
determines
matters
and
we
hope
we
can
at
times
guess
what
you
might
find
because
we
had
--
this
was
the
exact
situation.
now,
i
find
that
the
circuit
court
in
the
majority
and
minority
opinion
say
that
our
request
to
charge
was
right.
the
government
in
its
brief
here
say
that
our
request
to
charge
was
right.
however,
the
judge
refused
it
and
when
he
did,
it's
true
that
he
told
the
jury
that
you
couldn't
consider
halperin's
refusal
to
testify
on
the
question
of
his
guilt
or
innocence
but
that
you
could
consider
his
refusal
to
testify
before
the
grand
jury
on
the
question
of
his
credibility
with
respect
to
the
answers
to
those
questions.
well
now,
if
ever
i
heard
in
my
mind
a
distinction
without
a
difference,
that's
it.
what
is
there
in
a
defendant
before
a
jury
other
than
his
credibility
when
he
denies
complicity
in
the
crime,
there's
nothing
else.
and
to
say
on
the
one
hand
that
you're
not
to
consider
it
on
the
question
of
his
guilt
or
innocence
and
on
the
other
hand
to
say
they
should've
consider
it
on
the
question
of
whether
you
believe
him
or
not
is
certainly
to
say
to
a
jury
and
if
you
don't
believe
him
convict
him.
and
you
may
not
--
and
you
have
a
right
not
to
believe
him
because
he
once
pleaded
the
fifth
amendment.
now,
what's
the
purpose
of
the
amendment?
it's
either
a
right
or
take
it
away.
now
--
mr.
henry
g.
singer
yes.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
yes.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
i
--
mr.
henry
g.
singer
if
--
if
the
client
--
mr.
henry
g.
singer
yes,
sir.
i
would
--
mr.
henry
g.
singer
against
him
on
the
question
of
his
guilt
or
innocence,
not
and
--
but
he
specifically
said,
and
his
whole
charge
is
quoted
in
full
at
pages
718
in
my
brief.
and
he
said
twice
he
did
more
than
that.
oh,
no.
he
told
the
jury
and
i
don't
know
why
he
did
it,
but
it
was
a
gratuitous
statement
and
i
think
it
was
as
harmful
as
to
even
mention
of
the
fifth
amendment.
he
said
it
was
proper
and
he
said
it
twice,
it
was
proper
for
the
government
to
cross-examine
the
defendant
halperin
on
his
claim
of
the
privilege.
but
he
forgot
to
tell
the
jury
that
halperin
had
told
the
grand
jury
that
he
was
innocent
and
the
other
reasons.
so
all
that
we
had
left
was
not
a
fair,
if
we
--
if
we
would
even
go
to
this
extent
why
come
in
fairness
would
have
--
would
have
almost
demanded
i
say.
that
if
you're
going
to
put
two
so-called
different
statements
before
a
grand
--
before
a
jury,
you
should
put
all
of
both.
not
purely
the
word
fifth
amendment
which
apparently
carries
with
it
and
no
matter
what
the
courts
may
say,
no
matter
what
anyone
of
you
--
how
he
feel
the
(inaudible)
of
guilt.
there's
no
question
about
it
today
in
the
layman's
mind,
we've
heard
it
in
the
last
few
days.
i
might
say
even
the
chief
executive
made
some
comment
in
that
regard
within
the
last
week,
somebody
had
--
somebody
who
had
something
to
hide.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
yes.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
now,
i
say
that
taking
that
alone
coupled
with
his
failure
to
put
all
the
facts,
we
took
the
proper
exception
in
this
regard
that
we
now
had
a
position
where
there
was
neither
the
fifth
amendment
nor
a
discrepancy
nor
a
difference.
of
course,
i
must
stop
at
this
point,
this
fifth
amendment
comes
out
and
this
question
will
come
up
in
my
discussion
tomorrow
on
the
two
other
questions
which
your
--
the
court
has
certified
for
my
discussion.
i
wanted
to
point
out
that
if
the
defendant
and
the
--
judge
frank
seems
--
went
--
went
on
this
theory,
that
if
a
man
had
a
right
to
testify
under
the
statute
3481
of
the
title
18,
he
had
a
right
to
do
it
without
the
government
having
--
and
i
like
to
use
judge
--
justice
frankfurter's
words,
without
the
government
having
thrown
a
block
at
him
before
he
went
to
trial,
by
having
called
him
before
the
grand
jury,
forced
him
in
there
and
then
question.
now,
it's
true
it
wasn't
the
same
grand
jury
that
indicted
him
but
it's
true
that
they
used
the
evidence.
and
so
i
say
to
your
honor,
on
this
phase
of
the
--
of
our
--
of
the
discussion,
this
was
error
that
went
right
to
the
heart
of
the
case.
with
it,
halperin
had
to
stay
convicted.
without
it,
as
judge
frank
said,
he
had
a
fair
chance
to
be
acquitted.
in
addition,
we
went
along
further
than
that.
the
judge
during
his
cross-examination
said
to
halperin,
"when
you
said
before
the
grand
jury
that
you
refuse
to
answer
on
the
ground
of
self-incrimination,
was
that
true?"
which
would
indicate
of
course
that
and
mind
you
the
question,
some
of
them
were
directly
to
the
heart
of
this
case
and
some
were
as
to
in
--
of
what
i
would
deem
inconsequential
matters.
when
we
objected
the
court
said,
"well,
i
want
to
know
was
he
telling
the
grand
jury
the
truth
when
he
refuse
to
answer
on
the
ground
of
self-incrimination?"
and
i
say
to
the
court
that
again
at
that
the
point
the
court
forgotten
his
cross-examination
and
he
destroyed
the
defendant
at
that
time
to
point
out
that
the
man
said
he
was
innocent.
but
that
he
--
he
was
in
a
position,
where
as
the
record
would
show,
that
to
testify
at
that
time
was
to
subject
him
to
criminal
charges,
not
the
ones
involved
in
this
case.
there
was
a
cabal
against
--
against
halperin.
there
was
a
conspiracy
by
other
people
to
have
him
indicted
for
perjury.
there
was
no
question
that
this
went
right
to
the
heart
of
the
case.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
well,
that's
why
i
--
mr.
henry
g.
singer
that's
why
i
stopped,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
since
my
discussion
at
this
time
relates
to
that
very
grand
jury
on
the
--
the
question
presented,
number
7
which
is
that
it
was
whether
it
was
right,
ethical
to
call
a
prospective
defendant
before
the
grand
jury
at
all.
it
might
be
interesting
for
me.
at
least
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
might
be
interested
in
some
ready
references
to
the
grand
jury
testimony
as
they
appear
in
the
record.
now,
on
direct
examination,
on
cross-examination,
not
a
word
was
asked
or
was
said,
nor
was
there
a
suggestion
made
that
halperin
when
he
was
before
the
grand
jury
had
done
anything
else
other
than
claim
the
amendment
in
language
which
would
appear
that
the
--
that
it
might
tend
to
incriminate
or
degrade
him.
but
when
i
was
furnished
or
at
least
furnished
the
opportunity,
the
record
will
show
that
i
asked
for
a
copy
of
it
while
the
direct
--
this
cross-examination
was
going
on
and
the
court
couldn't
give
me
a
copy
so
that
i
could
follow
it.
it's
right
here
in
the
record.
and
i
said,
"well,
i'd
like
to
know
whether
any
questions
are
omitted
or
whether
it's
the
whole
of
his
--
of
his
answers
on
a
subject."
and
i
was
told
i
might
look
over
the
shoulder
of
the
assistant
while
he
was
examined.
i
then
asked,
“could
i
be
permitted
to
finish
a
redirect
of
halperin
without
an
opportunity
to
consult
him
by
having
the
grand
jury
minutes
immediately?”
now,
that's
in
this
trial
record
that's
before
you.
and
i
was
told
that
i
would
have
an
opportunity
to
see
them
at
least
as
because
there
were
no
copies
available.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
yes.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
yes,
without
delaying
it,
i
can
go
directly
to
it.
it
would
appear
it
started
at
page
684.
that's
the
very
first
question.
oh,
i'm
sorry,
your
honors.
excuse
me.
it
started
on
page
683
where
he
was
first
asked
the
top
of
the
page,
the
first
question
about
his
grand
jury
testimony.
your
honors
can
see
then
at
page
685
that
i
made
the
same
argument
that
i
made
before
this
court
that
he
was
not
a
voluntary
witness
before
the
grand
jury.
and
so
that
it
was
distinguished
from
the
raffel
case
which
is
mentioned
in
the
very
argument
that
i
made
to
the
district
court,
and
where
i
said
--
i
said
that
the
authority
of
the
raffel
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
situation
there.
it
was
a
voluntary
taking
of
the
witness
stand.
and
i
said
when
this
witness
was
not
a
voluntary
witness
when
he
came
before
the
grand
jury.
now,
we
go
on
where
there
were
direct
questions
asked
and
various
exceptions
made
until
at
page
694
of
the
record.
i
asked
the
court
and
it's
in
the
almost
the
very
top
of
the
page.
i
said
at
this
point,
i
would
be
--
i
would
like
to
be
permitted
under
the
united
states
against
remington
which
is
a
case
up
in
our
circuit
to
be
permitted
to
see
these
witnesses
for
grand
jury
testimony
at
this
very
time
when
the
direct
examination
was
going
on.
the
court
said,
"well,
i'd
probably
be
entitled
to
it,
but
i
have
to
wait
until
the
examination
was
finished."
right
there
in
the
record.
i
said
i'd
like
to
have
it
now,
so
i
could
follow
the
examination.
i'm
paraphrasing
what
i
said,
but
it's
in
the
record.
well,
the
court
said,
it
since
it's
going
to
be
adjourned
in
about
10
minutes,
it
--
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
finish
because
i
said
i
wanted
to
finish
my
redirect
on
the
subject
realizing
the
impact
on
the
jury
of
this
raising
of
a
claim
of
privilege
by
a
defendant
before
a
grand
jury.
now,
if
you'll
read
on,
the
court
said
it
wouldn't
be
possible
to
give
it
to
me.
they
were
going
to
adjourn
in
10
minutes.
they
were
going
to
direct
them
that
i'd
be
made
available.
i
mean
over
the
weekend.
and
they
said
it
was
up
to
me
if
i
didn't
want
to
talk
to
my
client
about
it,
but
i
wanted
the
jury
to
know
that
i
didn't
want
to
talk
to
him
about
it
because
i
knew
that
the
grand
jury
testimony
would
disclose
what
as
we
now
learn.
and
so,
i
--
the
judge
said
to
the
--
says
to
the
united
states
attorney,
“give
mr.
singer
a
copy
of
it.”
he
said
he
didn't
have
another
copy.
and
so,
we
went
on
with
the
direct.
and
i
was
--
there
was
--
a
suggestion
was
made
that
i
appear
over
his
shoulder,
and
of
course,
i
said
i
believe
that
he
would
read
the
questions
and
the
answers
properly.
and
i
know
he
did
and,
of
course,
i
waited
until
the
court
recess
and
then
i
got
a
few
minutes,
but
i
was
never
given
a
copy.
and
so,
when
i
returned
monday
morning,
i
proceeded
to
ask
mr.
--
i
then
made
my
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
very
ground
which
forms
the
basis
of
this
claim
here
that
it
was
wrong
to
call
the
target
of
an
investigation
before
the
grand
jury.
up
to
that
time,
i'd
the
slightest
notion
in
the
world
that
they
would
ever
question
him
about
it.
but
to
continue
with
this
other
phase
of
it
for
a
minute,
if
i
may,
i
then
learned
because
i
had
only
--
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
will
show
at
one
point
the
assistant
asked
the
defendant
whether
he
had
reported
to
me
what
he
had
said
before
the
grand
jury.
whether
he
had
made
notes
on
it
and
given
it
to
me.
and
it
appears
right
in
this
record.
however,
when
i
got
the
grand
jury
minutes,
i
learned
first
that
there
was
quite
an
argument
of
law
between
mr.
halperin
and
the
foreman
of
the
grand
jury
and
mr.
kennedy
who
was
the
assistant
of
united
states
attorney
and
mr.
parker
who
was
president.
look
at
page
705,
and
very
rapidly,
you
will
see
right
below
the
--
the
asterisks
in
the
center
of
the
page
and
that's
to
grant
my
reading
of
part
of
the
grand
jury
testimony.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
page
705,
sir.
halperin
told
the
grand
jury
that
he
could
give
them
plenty
of
citations
where
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york,
and
i'm
reading
it,
held
that
it
was
just
as
important
and
even
more
important
for
an
innocent
man
to
claim
the
privilege
than
it
was
for
a
guilty
person.
and
the
quotes
would
indicate
that
i
was
reading
from
the
grand
jury
minutes.
and
the
foreman
replied
to
him,
“these
were
state
cases.
these
are
in
federal
cases.”
read
right
ahead
in
the
very
next
answer
to
he
next
question.
and
then
we
find
mr.
kennedy
or
as
the
witness
said
he
wasn't
sure
whether
it
was
mr.
parker
saying,
“i'm
not
disputing
your
right
to
claim
the
privilege,
mr.
halperin,"
if
you
go
to
the
top
of
page
6.
and
halperin
said,
"i
know
you're
not
planning
my
privilege
and
i
regret
that
i'm
compelled
to
take
it
as
i've
explained
it
to
you."
now,
i
want
you
to
go
back
and
see
how
he
was
jockeyed
before
the
grand
jury.
he
used
the
language
as
in
he
ended
and
the
record
shows
at
page
704
at
the
top
of
the
page.
he
used
the
language
that
i
and
then
in
behalf
of
the
lawyer,
i
think
should
advise
the
client
who
was
--
might
claim
the
privilege.
you
said
i
--
an
advise
by
my
counsel
and
he
mentioned
my
name
but
i
must
have
declined
to
answer
any
questions
under
the
fifth
amendment
which
results
in
my
furnishing
evidence
which
could
be
used
against
him.
the
united
states
attorney
wasn't
satisfied
with
that.
and
if
you
read
705,
mr.
parker
says
to
him,
it's
in
the
record,
he
said,
"why
not
say
i
refused
to
answer
on
the
ground
that
it
might
tend
to
incriminate
or
degrade
you.”
it's
short.
well,
the
witness,
before
the
grand
jury
said,
"all
right,
if
that's
what
you
want
it
probably
means
the
same
thing.
i'll
say
it."
and
there
it
is.
and
the
second,
the
third
question
on
page
705.
so
that
this
was
no
--
you
see
and
when
the
united
states
attorney
questioned
him,
he
never
said
a
word
about
the
man
having
claimed
his
innocence
or
about
him
requesting
an
opportunity
to
be
confronted
by
a
witness
or
assisted
by
counsel
or
to
be
able
to
cross-examine
witnesses.
no,
it
was
left
alone.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
yes.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
all
that
the
judge
give
--
mr.
henry
g.
singer
--
the
jury
--
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
it
is
all.
it's
on
my
brief.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
and
it's
in
the
government's
brief
at
--
it's
in
my
brief,
if
i
find
it.
oh,
yes.
it's
in
my
brief
and
fall
from
the
bottom
of
page
17
to
the
bottom
to
--
and
the
top
of
page
18.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
not
one
other
word
was
said
in
the
charge.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
and
incidentally,
my
exception
for
a
ready
reference
appears
in
my
note
6
on
the
bottom
of
page
18.
so
that
the
whole
matter
is
actually
together
for
the
court's
convenience.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
oh,
yes.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
oh
well
--
mr.
henry
g.
singer
until
--
well,
when
i
--
mr.
henry
g.
singer
he
was
speaking
of
halperin.
there
was
no
other
witness
who
claimed
--
mr.
henry
g.
singer
and
--
mr.
henry
g.
singer
oh,
yes.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
no
question
about
it.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
not
a
word
would
you
see
in
this
record,
anyway.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
well,
if
you'll
take
--
yes,
he
did.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
yes.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
oh,
yes.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
yes.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
oh,
yes.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
yes.
the
court's
charge
--
mr.
henry
g.
singer
--
with
reference
to
mr.
halperin
begins
at
page
744.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
yes
--
he
--
oh,
no.
he
was
the
only
petitioner.
another
defendant
took
the
stand
who
was
acquitted.
if
you
look
at
the
bottom
of
page
744,
the
last
paragraph,
the
first
mention
of
mr.
halperin
--
excuse
me.
all
right,
744,
he
begins
with
mr.
halperin.
he
then
proceeds
to
do
something
that
i
never
referred
to
before.
he
goes
to
748
still
talking
about
what
halperin
had
said
on
this
and
other
accounts.
and
then
he
does
a
very
peculiar
thing
at
the
top
of
page
748
if
you
will
look
at
it.
just
before
he
begins
to
talk
about
halperin's
cross-examination,
the
judge
points
out
quite
out
of
context
with
any
other
matter
could
--
that
could
be
discussed.
he
gives
the
jury
the
stock
charge
that
they
had
a
right
to
disbelieve
all
of
the
witness
--
all
the
testimony
of
any
witness
who
may
have
testified
falsely
on
any
material
fact.
of
course,
that
was
a
proper
charge.
but
he
put
that
directly
ahead
of
it,
if
you
just
see
it
on
the
same
page
748.
and
then
comes
right
into
this
business
of
the
constitutional
privilege
leaving
out
all
the
claims
of
innocence
and
the
reasons
given
before
the
grand
jury,
not
as
we
speak
of
afterthoughts
at
a
trial.
well,
now,
we've
been
arguing
up
to
this
point,
if
i
may,
the
end
result
of
an
appearance
of
a
prospective
defendant
before
a
grand
jury.
and
sometimes
it's
good
to
reason
backwards
so
that
you
can
see
the
end
result
of
an
improper
act.
which
you've
got
to
go
to
the
beginning
of
it
to
see
that
this
was
no
accident.
and
i
say,
it
was
deliberately
engineered.
there's
no
question
about
it.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
this
calling
of
them
--
of
a
prospective
defendant
before
the
grand
jury
because
if
the
raffel
case
was
good
law,
and
i
say
it
never
applied
to
this
case
anyway,
whether
it
was
--
if
this
court
wants
to
continue
the
rule
in
the
raffel
case.
it
was,
i
say,
part
of
a
well-designed
plan
to
call
a
man
before
the
grand
jury
knowing
in
he
would
refuse
to
answer,
cutting
his
answer
down
from
the
fifth
amendment
and
not
obliged
to
give
testimony
that
could
be
used
against
him
to
the
stock
phrase.
it
will
incriminate
or
degrade
me
and
i
don't
know
where
mr.
parker,
the
u.s.
attorney
got
to
degrade
me
business.
that's
been
out
of
fashion
since
i
was
a
boy
and
that's
some
years
ago.
but
that's
the
fashion
in
which
it
--
he
was
--
that's
the
point
at
which
he
was
put.
now,
you've
got
to
have
put
this
--
you
got
--
i
say
you
must
look
at
it
these
two
ways.
how
does
it
come
to
this
court?
well
first,
on
constitutional
grounds,
is
it
denial
of
due
process?
and
second,
a
manner
which
many
people
overlook
throughout
the
country
and
that
is
that
this
court,
since
sometime
in
1945
or
thereabout,
has
by
statute
complete
supervision
of
the
procedure
in
the
trial
of
both
federal
--
in
federal
courts
of
both
criminal
and
civil
cases.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
yes.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
he
did
not
--
mr.
henry
g.
singer
he
did
not.
and
i
might
say
to
your
honor,
he
was
called
not
once
but
five
or
six
times.
he
was
there
20
days
on
different
occasions
that
would
do
him
no
good.
who
could
vacate
the
subpoena?
how
could
anybody
move
to
vacate
a
subpoena
of
a
person?
he
might
have
been
asked
as
he
did
answer
many
questions.
you
see
the
subterfuge
only
is
that
he's
not
a
prospect
of
war
as
judge
medina
once
described
the
defendant
in
the
scully
case,
a
de
facto
defendant.
he's
brought
there
as
a
witness.
and
like
the
government
here
says,
"oh
well,
he
wasn't
there
as
a
defendant.
he
was
there
as
a
witness."
the
grand
jury
in
their
inquisitorial
powers
had
the
right
to
inquire
about
many
things.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
that's
correct.
now,
i
want
to
point
out
that
it
goes
beyond
that.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
oh,
yes.
it
is
because
each
time
there'd
be
a
double
deal.
you
see
--
mr.
henry
g.
singer
same
time,
every
time,
there
would
be
--
if
you
get
the
grand
jury
minutes
and
i've
only
saw
him
for
10
minutes.
i
only
saw
these
pages
for
10
minutes
sufficient
to
get
enough
for
these
questions.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
it
wasn't
--
mr.
henry
g.
singer
well,
may
i
say
this.
if
it
--
you
--
you
noticed
the
use
of
the
word
--
mr.
henry
g.
singer
--
"court's
exhibit."
it
wasn't
shown
to
the
jury.
i
had
the
opportunity
--
mr.
henry
g.
singer
i
know.
i
had
the
opportunity
to
see
it
for
10
or
15
minutes.
i'm
not
complaining
about
that.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
but
i
--
i
should
also
see
it
while
i
was
--
excuse
me,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
well
--
mr.
henry
g.
singer
is
it
in
the
case?
it's
not
offered
an
evidence.
it
wasn't
shown
to
the
jury.
it's
simply
marked
as
the
"court's
exhibit"
so
at
--
at
any
future
time
if
you
wanted
to
see
you
could
and
i
couldn't
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
henry
g.
singer
of
course,
it
did.
it
examined
it.
but
that's
what
happens
with
court
exhibits.
but
let's
--
let's
get
--
i
--
i
will
be
on
that.
now,
the
government's
claim
here
is,
why
the
grand
jury
knew
nothing
about
mr.
halperin.
they
didn't
even
know
the
name
of
grunewald,
the
washington
associate,
put
at
this
very
same
time
in
the
government's
brief.
and
it
was
part
of
the
trial
itself.
it
showed
that
grunewald
who
was
supposed
to
be
and
they've
described
him.
anyway,
let's
accept
it
for
this
purpose,
the
so-called
washington
associate.
his
secretary,
ms.
hain
was
called
before
the
grand
jury
and
she
testified
and
it's
in
the
record
and
in
my
reply
brief
and
in
the
government's
directly,
that
she
was
subpoenaed
to
brooklyn
while
this
brooklyn
grand
jury
was
being
--
the
proceedings
were
there
being
conducted
back
in
1952.
that
she
talked
to
the
united
states
attorney,
to
the
special
assistant,
to
the
first
assistant
a
mr.
(inaudible)
and
some
government
agent.
but
beyond
that
and
the
record
shows
it.
it
appears
right
in
the
trial
testimony
when
mr.
halperin
was
called
before
the
grand
jury,
the
district
attorney
was
loaded,
forebear.
he
had
an
idea
in
which
it
would
--
it
would
have
been
perfectly
proper
that
halperin,
a
lawyer,
would
claim
that
since
he
was
a
lawyer,
he
couldn't
divulge
confidential
communications.
so,
the
assistant
before
the
grand
jury
showed
halperin
a
paper
which
he
said
was
a
letter
from
the
three
patullo
defendants,
the
three
patullo
plans
wherein
they
waived
the
privilege,
the
relationship
of
the
attorney
claim
so
as
to
deprive
halperin
of
any
claim
he
might
have
by
way
of
privilege.
and
now,
to
top
it
all,
though,
though
it's
not
in
the
record
and
i
know
there'll
be
no
denial
of
it,
this
very
washington
associate,
grunewald,
was
called
before
the
grand
jury
in
brooklyn.
there
were
proceedings
in
connection
with
his
illness
to
compel
him
to
testimony.
there
were
long
hearings
before
the
court
and
the
whole
thing
is
a
lot
of
nonsense.
it's
a
lot
of
expressions
and
words,
which
he
used,
as
i
say
even
today,
to
conceal
the
fact
that
there
was
no
mystery
before
that
grand
jury
that
halperin
was
a
target.
now,
let's
say
he
wasn't
the
prime
target.
i
don't
know
if
i'm
being
shot
at
whether
i
care
if
they
hit
me
in
number
five
or
number
one
on
a
target.
i
am
there.
and
that's
the
point.
now,
let's
see
what
happens
when
you
do
a
thing
like
that.
you
start
off
what
might
--
what
might
look
like
a
very
legitimate
thing,
subpoenaing
a
person
before
the
grand
jury.
but
you
know
he's
a
defendant.
you
know
he's
the
person
against
whom,
and
the
trial
testimony
discloses
this
fact
that
every
single
witness
with
the
exception
of
davis
and
hoffman
on
cross-examination
when
i
examined
them
said
that
they
had
told
the
grand
jury
in
brooklyn
every
single
thing
that
they
told
the
trial
jury.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
some
instances
in
an
attempt
to
develop
the
inconsistency
so
that
i
could
cross-examine
and
try
to
get
the
brooklyn
grand
jury
minutes,
the
judge
himself
read
the
brooklyn
grand
jury
minutes
and
made
a
statement
that
there
was
no
inconsistency.
so,
that's
proven
conclusively.
but
second,
now,
let's
take
davis
and
hoffman.
and
this
--
i
might
complain
to
the
court.
you
refused
to
grant
one
of
my
questions.
you've
been
very
kind
in
granting
the
others
on
a
hypothetical
question.
davis,
at
the
stand
--
now,
he
was
the
principal
architect.
that
this
is
the
man
who
was
supposed
to
have
really
conducted
this
whole
thing
as
i
get
this,
as
the
trial
seemed
to
show.
he
was
the
brains
who
figured
out
how
to
get
the
money
and
how
to
cheat
the
clients
or
whatever
he
did.
he
testified
on
redirect
in
an
attempt
to
rehabilitate
him
after
he'd
been
completely
destroyed
on
cross-examination.
that
long
before
the
trial,
back
in
1952,
he
had
disclosed
in
full
all
of
these
dealings
with
the
washington
associates,
would
have
been
--
which
would
have
been
with
halperin
or
bolich
and
mr.
grunewald
in
a
hypothetical
statement.
what
it
meant,
i
don't
know.
i
never
saw
the
statement.
the
court
permitted
the
question.
of
course,
the
statement
wasn't
offered.
i
objected.
the
circuit
court
said
that
it
was
a
prior
consistent
statement
and
it
was
permitted
in.
but
that,
i'm
willing
to
take
that
hypothetical
statement
as
proof
from
the
government's
own
lips
that
that
brooklyn
grand
jury
knew
that
halperin
was
an
--
a
--
the
prospective
defendant.
and
now,
to
cut
the
climax,
the
government
comes
up
with
a
new
one.
it
says,
"well,
anyway
the
brooklyn
grand
jury
could
never
have
indicted
halperin."
of
course,
there
was
no
overt
act
committed
in
brooklyn.
well,
why
did
they
have
an
investigation
there?
why
did
they
call
people
before
grand
juries
in
the
district
that
has
no
jurisdiction?
but
again,
and
this
is
no
forum
of
mr.
davis.
he
forgets
that
this
record
shows
that
the
income
tax
return
in
the
gotham
beef
case
was
filed
in
brooklyn.
there's
testimony
in
the
record.
and
that
the
agents
who
investigated
that
--
this
case
was
an
agent
from
the
brooklyn
office
who
had
referred,
not
that
it's
important,
because
when
we
go
to
the
question
of
due
process,
we
must
ultimately
come
to
the
old
case
of
counselman
against
hitchcock
where
this
court
said
to
call
a
prospective
defendant
or
for
a
defendant
before
the
grand
jury
was
wrong.
next,
in
our
own
state
court
and
i
have
cited
the
cases,
they've
held
that
to
call
a
man
before
the
grand
jury
who
was
a
--
who
was
a
prospective
defendant
vitiates
the
complete
case.
now,
judge
medina
in
the
scully
case
in
our
circuit,
and
i
think,
your
honors,
denied
certiorari
in
the
matter,
said
in
substance
that
he
couldn't
believe
that
this
was
something
that
was
done
so
generally.
but
he
said
it
was
wrong
and
unethical
in
substance.
if
i
used
the
wrong
adjective,
i'll
withdraw
it.
in
substance,
he
said
it
was
wrong.
it
was
improper.
however,
he
said,
"i
hope
no
united
states
attorney
would
do
it."
in
this
circuit
recently,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
said
a
the
recent
case,
which
we've
cited
in
the
powell
case,
the
government
cites
it.
that
mr.
powell
was
undoubtedly
the
target
of
the
investigation
but
they
reversed
on
another
ground
and
that
there
was
serious
doubt
as
to
why
they
should
call
it.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
answered
your
question
rapidly.
when
i
said
that
he
answered
many
questions.
but,
i,
by
no
means
intended
to
suggest
nor
to
convey
to
your
honor
or
to
any
of
the
other
justices
that
there
were
any
questions
asked
of
how
a
person,
which
related
to
any
matters
outside
of
this
so-called
tax
fixing
ring.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
there
was
some
that
he
could
answer
without
furnishing
a
link
in
the
chain
of
evidence.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
well,
now,
it
--
i
don't
want
to
get
involved
in
the
waiver
because
if
ever
there
was
a
trap
laid
for
anyone,
and
i
don't
know
who
he
is
whether
he's
a
judge,
a
lawyer
or
a
layman,
who
can
decide
when
he
waives
and
when
he
doesn't
waive.
i
would
like
to
see
the
person
in
the
situation.
it's
easy
to
explain
that
later.
and
so,
you
--
you
can
see
if
you
ever
get
this
exhibit
where
although
you
claim
the
privilege
at
one
point,
a
united
states
attorney
says
to
you,
"well,
that
couldn't
possibly
incriminate
you.
what
difference
does
it
make?"
so,
you
answer
it.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
of
course,
he
didn't
because
the
united
states
attorney
said
to
him,
"you're
entitled
to
your
privilege
and
i
want
you
to
know
that
i'm
not
taking
it
away
from
you,
except
that
i
will
tell
you
what
words
to
use."
and
so,
i
--
mr.
henry
g.
singer
yes
sir.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
why
don't
we
put
it
this
way,
your
honor?
there's
no
testimony
as
far
as
i
can
see
it,
direct
testimony
except
through
halperin
because
under
the
factual
proof,
it
would
say
that
halperin,
who
made
the
arrangement
with
grunewald,
although
at
one
stage
in
the
proceeding,
another
man,
davis,
says
he
was
present
just
while
a
word
"okay"
was
said
or
there
was
no
such
proof.
or
the
whole
thing
was
a
swindle
on
the
part
of
davis
to
cheat
his
clients
out
of
$160,000.
and
that's
the
whole
thing
and
that's
why
judge
frank
said
in
his
dissenting
opinion
that
the
jury
could
well
reasonably
have
acquitted
halperin.
now,
i
have
about
eight
or
ten
minutes
and
i
would
like
to
go
to
another
subject,
if
i
may.
i
might
say
to
your
honor,
now
--
before
i
finish
and
i'm
not
saying
this
just
for
words.
this
business
of
calling
people
before
the
grand
jury
and
the
question
of
the
fifth
amendment
isn't
new
in
our
country
and
it's
a
little
different
in
england.
judge
taft
pointed
that
out
in
one
case.
there,
the
privilege
against
incrimination
in
england
and
when
he
was
a
circuit
court
judge,
judge
taft
pointed
out
was
the
statutory
privilege.here,
it's
a
constitutional
privilege.
and
so,
that's
quite
a
different
situation.
but
secondly,
you
talk
about
star
chamber
proceedings
and
the
grand
inquisition.
what
could
be
worst
than
to
take
a
man
who
knows
he's
going
to
be
charged
with
a
crime,
take
him
away
from
his
counsel,
take
him
away
from
the
opportunity
to
cross-examine
and
ask
him
a
lot
of
questions
about
a
lot
of
people
and
remember
what
your
honors
have
all
said
here.
that
if
he
says,
"i
know
joe
brown"
who
may
be
his
law
partner
or
his
brother,
he
may
be
deemed
to
have
waived
the
privilege
and
opened
the
door.
i'm
not
stating
an
extreme
case
but
as
i
read
the
old
--
the
rogers
case,
i
find
that
i
don't
know
where
to
tell
a
man
to
stop.
now,
i
want
to
go
to
the
last
of
the
questions
presented.
if
i
can
have
just
another
--
i
have
about
three
minutes,
i
think.
here,
we
have
again
the
fifth
amendment.
this
presents
a
rather
different
problem.
i
must
agree
at
the
very
outset
that
since
this
court
doesn't
review
facts,
that
i
must
accept
the
circuit
court's
opinion
and
majority
opinion
on
this
last
question.
it
leads
back
to
a
question
that
your
honors
asked
about
the
--
these
acts
of
concealment.
somebody
asked,
"well,
who
committed
the
acts
of
concealment?”
that
is
asking
people
supposedly
not
to
furnish
information.
it
isn't
true
that
there
weren't
separate
charges
about
it.
counts
5,
6
and
7
of
this
indictment
actually
charges
halperin,
grunewald
and
bolich
as
a
substantive
offense
with
having
impeded
justice
by
asking
three
different
persons
to
--
to
testify
so-called
not
--
or
not
to
testify
before
a
grand
jury.
we'll
omit
the
phraseology
of
the
indictment
for
this
purpose.
yet,
at
the
same
time,
when
the
case
before
the
case
went
to
the
jury,
the
trial
judge
dismissed
those
counts
against
grunewald
and
bolich
because
there
was
no
proof
to
connect
them
with
him,
and
yet,
the
government
now
says
that
under
the
conspiracy
section,
they
could
be
held
as
being
responsible
for
it.
and
yet,
we
all
know
under
section
2
of
the
--
of
title
18
and
later
when
the
federal
justice
say
in
this
and
a
--
as
a
conspirator
and
so
that
argument
fails
by
itself.
those
so-called
overt
acts
of
concealment
were
dismissed
by
the
court
as
against
the
others.
but
halperin
himself
was
a
lawyer.
and
the
--
as
i
read
the
facts,
he
for
motives
of
his
own
and
i'll
be
very
frank
to
say
and
to
protect
himself
advised
three
different
persons
that
if
they
were
called
before
the
grand
jury,
they
should
plead
the
fifth
amendment.
the
court
in
its
majority
opinion
said
that
halperin
never
told
anybody
to
lie.
he
never
asked
anybody
to
purge
himself.
but
as
--
and
apparently,
he
wasn't
their
lawyer.
he
had
been.
and
gratuitously,
let's
put
it
that
way.he
said
to
them,
"if
you're
called,
you
plead
the
fifth
amendment.
i'm
going
to
plead
it."
now,
i
ask
you,
is
that
a
crime?
the
court
said,
“of
course,
and
its
judge
that
if
you
ask
anybody
to
plead
the
fifth
amendment,
you're
not
guilty
of
a
crime.”
however,
the
facts
as
the
circuit
court
gives
it
reduces
itself
to
this
part.
there
were
two
cases
on
the
circuit.
one
comes
from
california,
your
honor,
in
the
(inaudible)
case
in
the
district
court.
it's
never
been
reversed,
never
appealed
and
there
was
the
almost
similar
situation,
personal
motives.
now,
i
say
it
makes
no
difference
if
you're
a
lawyer
or
a
layman.
i
have
a
right
to
tell
a
stranger
even
if
it's
going
to
help
me
and
judge
taft
said
so
in
the
urban
cases,
the
only
other
case
on
this
subject
that
i
can
point.
the
government
has
cited
none
other
--
i'll
stop
at
this
point.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
yes.
mr.
henry
g.
singer
of
course,
it
does.
i've
pointed
it
out
only
in
relation
to
those
--
to
those
acts
of
concealment
alleged
subornation
of
perjury.
he
showed
that
they
were
dismissed
against
two
people
whom
i
don't
represent
to
show
you
that
it
couldn't
be
part
of
the
conspiracy
because
if
it
were,
then
the
conspiracy
theory
would
apply
whether
it
was
a
substance
of
a
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
henry
g.
singer
it
leaves
counts
5,
6
--
mr.
henry
g.
singer
--
and
7
against
my
client
who
was
personally
--
mr.
henry
g.
singer
--
indicted
and
not
who
was
personally
convicted.
do
i
have
those
extra
five
minutes
that
your
honors
said
i
could
have
in
view
of
the
--
mr.
henry
g.
singer
--
10
minutes.
thank
you
very
much,
sir.
