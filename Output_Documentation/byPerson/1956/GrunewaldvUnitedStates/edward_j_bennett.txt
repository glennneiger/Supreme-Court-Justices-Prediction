mr.
edward
j.
bennett
may
it
please
the
court.
henry
grunewald,
the
petitioner
in
number
183
together
with
the
other
two
petitioners
was
convicted
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
of
conspiracy
to
bring
about
corrupt
revenue
department
decisions
and
fraud
of
the
united
states
and
to
conceal
the
crime
from
all
investigating
agencies
in
the
future.
the
significant
feature
for
present
purposes
is
that
element
of
concealment
because
without
it
prosecutions
of
the
crime
would
have
been
barred
admittedly
by
the
statute
of
limitations
and
it
is
admitted
by
the
government,
was
conceded
upon
the
trial
that
they
had
proven
no
act
within
the
limitations
period
except
an
act
of
concealment.
the
conviction
on
this
conspiracy
count,
which
is
count
one
of
the
indictment
in
the
record,
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
with
judge
frank
dissenting.
the
majority
held
that
there
was,
as
part
of
the
original
crime,
a
conspiracy
to
conceal
for
all
the
future
and
therefore
subsequent
acts
of
concealment
sufficed
to
bring
the
original
crime
down
within
the
period
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
judge
frank's
dissenting
held
that
the
conviction
was
improper
under
the
principles
stated
by
this
court
in
the
krulewitch
case
and
the
lutwak
case
in
which
this
court
held
that
no
conspiracy
to
continue
to
conceal
a
crime
which
had
been
accomplished
would
be
implied
from
the
crime
itself
and
that
subsequent
acts
of
concealment
would
not
serve
to
extend
the
life
of
the
conspiracy
because
it
would
destroy
the
statute
of
limitations
and
would
make
one
man,
who
would
conspire
with
another,
responsible
for
the
other's
acts
for
all
the
future.
for
example,
if
he
went
out
three
or
four
years
after
the
crime
and
shot
a
witness,
if
you
are
going
to
imply
a
conspiracy
to
conceal,
why
all
of
the
original
conspirators
would
be
responsible.
now,
in
order
to
see
how
those
principles
fit
into
this
case,
i
should
give
your
honors
a
brief
outline
of
the
facts.
in
1948,
there
were
two
corporate
taxpayers
who
are
being
investigated
for
income
tax
fraud
by
the
fraud
bureau
of
the
internal
revenue.
the
function
of
that
bureau
was
to
determine
whether
or
not
to
recommend
criminal
prosecution.
and
under
their
administrative
practice
if
at
any
point
in
their
investigation
they
determine
not
to
recommend
criminal
prosecution,
the
criminal
phase
ends
and
the
matter
is
then
remitted
to
the
civil
side
for
assessment
of
taxes,
penalties,
whatever
it
may
be.
the
point
is
that
the
critical
thing
in
such
an
investigation
is
to
get
a
recommendation
of
no
criminal
prosecution.
both
of
these
taxpayers,
one
was
named
gotham
beef
company
and
the
other
patullo
modes
were
represented
by
the
same
firm
of
attorneys
in
new
york.
that
firm
headed
up
by
a
man
named
davis.
davis
was
a
government
witness
and
testified
that
through
the
petitioner
halperin,
help
was
obtained
from
the
petitioner
grunewald,
whom
i
represent,
to
bring
about
that
recommendation.
the
theory
being
that
grunewald
was
a
friend
of
the
third
petitioner,
bolich
who
during
the
period
in
question
was
an
official
in
the
internal
revenue
department.
during
part
of
the
time
he
was
the
head
of
the
new
york
office
of
the
fraud
bureau
and
thereafter
was
an
assistant
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
with
authority
in
the
premises.
the
gotham
beef
company
decision
came
down
in
october
1948,
no
criminal
prosecution.
on
january
10,
1949,
the
patullo
modes
decision
was
announced,
no
criminal
prosecution.
the
indictment
in
this
case
was
found
october
25,
1954,
a
lapse
of
almost
six
years
with
admittedly
a
three-year
statute
of
limitation.
now,
how
is
the
gap
filled?
in
february
of
1952,
there
was
impaneled
in
brooklyn,
new
york
a
grand
jury
to
investigate
these
cases
and
perhaps
others.
that
grand
jury
subpoenaed
before
it
at
least
three
witnesses
from
the
two
taxpayer
companies
and
it
appeared
that
in
february
and
march
on
three
different
occasions
at
one
point
davis
spoke
to
one
of
those
witness,
davis
was
the
attorney
who
had
represented
the
taxpayers
originally.
davis
spoke
to
one
of
them
and
found
out
he
was
going
to
testify
and
said
he
was
crazy
to
do
so
and
he
ought
to
at
least
to
consult
some
other
attorneys
and
his
current
attorneys
before
he
did
it.
on
two
other
occasions,
mr.
halperin,
the
petitioner
in
184
i
believe
it
is,
spoke
to
the
other
two
witnesses
and
said
he
was
going
to
rely
on
his
constitutional
rights.
he
was
going
to
stand
silent.
he
has
been
subpoenaed
also
before
the
grand
jury
and
he
thought
it
would
be
a
wise
thing
for
everybody
to
do
so
and
perhaps
the
whole
thing
would
flow
over.
now,
those
three
items
are
claimed
to
be
items
of
concealment,
those
three
incidents.
there's
a
fourth
item
but
perhaps
while
among
those
three
i
might
mention
parenthetically
that
those
three
incidents
were
made
the
subject
of
substantive
counts
of
attempting
to
interfere
with
witnesses,
counts
five,
six
and
seven
in
the
indictment.
but
the
trial
court
acquitted
all
defendants
on
those
counts
and
sent
them
to
the
jury
only
as
against
the
defendant
halperin.
however,
they
remained
in
the
case
from
the
government's
standpoint
on
the
theory
that
they
are
attempts
to
conceal.
there
the
fourth
item
of
concealment
that
i
mentioned
is
one
involving
directly
my
client
grunewald.
he
lived
here
in
washington
and
in
may
of
1952,
a
girl
who
lived
here
and
who
had
been
his
part-time
secretary
for
some
several
months
in
the
latter
part
of
1949,
after
these
cases
had
been
disposed
of,
and
for
some
several
months
in
the
latter
part
of
1950
was
subpoenaed
to
appear
before
that
brooklyn
grand
jury
and
presumably
to
tell
whatever
she
might
know
about
grunewald.
he
in
speaking
with
her
immediately
thereafter
has
said,
“they
can't
do
that.
they
can't
require
you
to
tell
my
personal
affairs
and
you
could
say
you
don't
remember.”
now,
accepting
that
as
an
act
of
concealment,
we
have
three
to
three-and-half
years
after
the
event.
i'm
omitting
an
incident
of
1950
which
the
trial
court
omitted
and
discharged,
which
doesn't
affect
the
principle
and
just
for
simplicity's
sake.
we
have
these
incidents
of
three
to
three-and-half
years
after
the
event
of
possible
efforts
at
concealment.
and
i
think
if
that
were
the
only
question
before
your
honors,
it
would
be
clear
that
the
decisions
in
krulewitch
and
lutwak
apply.
that
when
the
investigation
draws
close
to
a
man
who
has
committed
a
crime
and
he
tries
to
cover
up
or
conceal,
that
sort
of
conduct
is
in
the
nature
of
afterthought.
it
does
not
mean
that
three-and-half
years
before,
all
of
the
conspirators
must
be
deemed
to
have
agreed
to
conceal
for
all
of
the
future.
so,
we
have
to
go
back
one
step
further
to
the
period
of
the
original
crime,
and
i
may
say
to
your
honors
that
this
theory
is
advanced
in
the
government
brief
and
was
relied
on
likewise
by
the
majority
opinion
in
the
court
below.
in
connection
with
that
phase,
the
original
criminal
--
the
period
of
the
original
crime
there
are
two
thoughts
that
they
advanced.
first,
they
say,
the
court
of
appeals
said
it,
“well,
these
men
must
have
known
they
were
committing
a
crime.
they
must
have
known
that
they
would
be
subject
to
investigation
or
they
might
be
subject
to
investigation,
so
they
must
have
intended
to
conceal.”
in
other
words,
from
the
mere
fact
that
they
were
committing
the
crime,
they
must
have
intended
to
conceal
it.
now
that,
your
honor,
is
precisely
what
you
said
in
the
krulewitch
case
that
you
rejected
in
the
very
word.
so
there
was
one
last
recourse
and
that
is
this.
they
say
that
in
the
course
of
the
commission
of
the
original
crime
there
was
surreptitious
conduct.
for
example,
and
these
three
items
are
hence
relied
upon
in
the
government's
brief.
they
say
that
at
one
point
in
the
course
of
that
original
conspiracy.
there
was
a
question
of
money
passing
and
the
conspirators
insisted
that
the
money
passed
or
be
collected
or
moved
in
cash
rather
than
by
check
and
therefore
they
must
be
intending
to
conceal.
at
another
point,
they
say
that
the
conspirators
did
not
even
disclose
to
the
taxpayers,
who
were
part
of
the
conspiracy,
the
name
of
their
contact
man
in
washington,
who
was
said
to
have
been
grunewald.
therefore,
they
say
they
were
concealing
him.
a
third
thing,
one
of
the
taxpayers
had
a
legal
representative
who
was
making
certain
arguments
before
the
tax
authorities.
he
was
apparently
not
cognizant
of
anything
else
that
was
going
on
and
the
court
of
appeals
says,
the
government
repeats,
they
did
not
disclose
to
him
that
they
had
a
conspiracy
working.
in
other
words,
they
didn't
tell
anybody
that
they
were
accomplishing
their
result
by
corrupt
means,
so
they
were
concealing.
and
so
that
you
have
the
question
to
mere
--
does
mere
(inaudible)
of
conduct
in
the
course
of
the
commission
of
a
crime
permit
an
influence
that
for
all
of
future
all
of
the
conspirators
are
conspiring
to
conceal
from
all
future
investigating
agencies.
and
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
that
such
an
inference
isn't
wholly
unreasonable
inference,
it's
an
impossible
inference.
just
see
what
it
means.
mr.
edward
j.
bennett
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
bennett
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
there's
an
additional
theory
that
i'll
--
mr.
edward
j.
bennett
that
--
that's
another
phase
of
the
theory
which
i
was
coming
to
after
i
discuss
the
concealment,
i'll
be
glad
to
discuss
it.
mr.
edward
j.
bennett
oh,
you're
correct
about
that,
but
that
was
part
of
the
reason
for
their
--
the
court
of
appeals'
action.
they
had
this
additional
theory,
that
is
--
it
was
perfectly
apparent
that
this
is
a
difficult
situation.
they
said
in
the
majority
opinion,
perhaps
this
conspiracy
was
not
just
to
get
this
no
criminal
prosecution
recommendation.
perhaps
the
conspiracy
was
to
guarantee
the
taxpayers
immunity
from
prosecution
for
the
entire
period
of
statute
of
limitations
open
against
them.for
example,
in
the
patullo
modes
case,
it
might
have
been
down
until
the
end
of
1952
and
1953.
now,
that
was
one
of
the
theories
advanced
but
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
that
was
only
one
theory
of
the
court
of
appeals
because
if
you
will
look
at
judge
medina's
opinion,
you
will
see
what
he
says
all
of
the
things
that
i
have
said,
he
has
said
they
must
have
known
they
--
they
would
be
open
to
investigation.
he
said
there
was
concealment
because
they
did
these
things,
they
asked
for
money
instead
of
cash,
instead
of
check.they
didn't
disclose
the
conspiracy
to
an
innocent
lawyer
in
the
picture
and
they
did
other
elements
of
concealment.
in
other
words,
i
don't
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
rested
so
firm
as
the
majority
solely
on
the
proposition
that
the
period
of
the
original
conspiracy
was
bounded
by
the
statute
of
limitations
against
the
taxpayer.
and
if
they
did,
and
i
may
as
well
go
into
that
right
now,
i
think
it
would
be
quite
insupportable
in
the
record.
in
the
first
place,
it
was
not
the
theory
which
the
trial
courts
submitted
to
the
jury
because
the
trial
court
told
the
jury
just
about
what
i
have
said
here
in
respect
of
the
two
no
prosecution
decisions
and
they
said
to
them,
you'll
find
that
quoted
in
my
brief,
"did
the
conspiracy
end
when
they
obtained
those
no
prosecution
decisions
in
1949
or
did
it
include
an
agreement
to
conceal
for
all
the
future.
and
if
it
did
then
you
can
find
that
subsequent
acts
of
concealment
were
an
overt
act
now."
mr.
edward
j.
bennett
all
he
said
was
conceal,
so
that
conceal
for
the
benefit
of
the
defendants
would
have
been
ample
to
convict
which
is
the
point
--
one
of
the
points
of
judge
frank's
difference
with
the
charge
as
given
by
the
court.
may
i
finish
off
my
discussion
of
the
theory
of
the
extended
conspiracy
that
is
after
making
the
suggestions
that
i
have
referred
to
with
respect
to
the
possibility
of
inferring
a
continuing
agreement
to
conceal
from
mere
(inaudible)
of
conduct
which
means
that
if
i
say
to
someone,
"i'll
take
cash
instead
of
check,"
i
am
therefore
--
thereby
authorizing
my
co-conspirator
three
to
four
years
from
now
to
bribe
a
witness
or
to
shoot
a
witness
or
do
something
like
that.
i
say
that's
an
impossible
inference
to
draw.
that
from
mere
surreptitious
conduct
in
the
course
of
the
crime
that
you
cannot
derive
a
conspiracy
to
conceal.
now,
to
go
back,
mr.
justice
harlan,
to
the
suggestion
of
judge
medina
in
the
majority
opinion
that
perhaps
the
conspiracy
was
bounded
by
the
statute
of
limitations
as
against
the
taxpayers
which
in
his
view
might
have
extended
it
down
until
the
end
of
1952.
as
i
say
that
was
not
submitted
to
the
jury.
i
think
judge
frank
confirms
us
in
that
that
it
was
not
submitted
to
the
jury.
in
the
second
place,
its
directly
contrary
to
the
evidence,
the
evidence
was
very
clear.
one
taxpayer
said,
"the
lawyer
told
me."
all
i
can
guess
here
you
don't
get
anything
in
the
way
of
--
of
public
certificate
or
anything,
all
you
get
is
a
memorandum
put
in
the
files
no
criminal
prosecution
because
that's
the
way
that
bureau
acts.
and
when
they
got
that
they
paid
the
money
that
they
were
supposed
to
pay.
in
the
other
case,
the
fellow
said,
"if
i
can
hear
from
an
official
in
the
bureau
that
there
will
be
--
they
have
decided
no
criminal
prosecution,
i'll
pay."
he
heard
it
and
he
paid.
and
all
that
was
over
by
january
10,
1949.
that
was
the
object
of
the
conspiracy
and
to
get
that
recommendation
of
no
criminal
prosecution
because
it
was
that
administrative
practice
that
prevailed,
that
once
you
got
that
there
wasn't
any.
now,
going
back
to
judge
medina's
theory
again,
as
i've
said
it
wasn't
borne
out
by
the
evidence.
it
wasn't
submitted
to
the
jury.
third,
no
matter
how
long
a
conspiracy
might
be
projected
at
the
start,
when
it
comes
to
proving
a
criminal
conspiracy
on
the
trial,
you
have
to
prove
it
by
some
act.
the
government
has
to
prove
the
continuance
of
the
conspiracy,
it's
the
criminal
case,
they
must
prove
their
case.
and
it
is
conceded
here
that
there
was
no
act
proven
except
an
act
of
concealment
within
the
three
years
prior
to
indictment,
so
that
this
theory
of
an
extended
conspiracy
really
has
no
substance
towards
your
honor.
it
wasn't
submitted,
this
isn't
borne
out
by
the
facts,
it's
over
borne
by
the
very
concessions
made
by
the
government.
as
a
matter
fact,
your
honors,
i
think
there's
something
wrong
with
this
whole
theory
of
conspiracy
to
conceal.
now,
i
may
be
going
a
little
further
than
i
should
for
that
i
have
to
on
this,
but
as
i
see
it
our
criminal
conspiracy
statute
makes
it
a
crime
to
agree
to
commit
an
offense
whether
its
by
fraud
or
by
infraction
of
a
particular
statute.
the
point
is
agreeing
to
commit
something
that
is
an
offense,
a
mere
general
purpose
to
conceal
which
you
can
derive
from
every
criminal
conspiracy.
it
doesn't
constitute
a
criminal
object
so
as
to
make
it
a
crime
under
our
federal
conspiracy
statute.
i
may
conceal
by
perfectly
legitimate
means.
i
may
take
the
most
direct
possible
concealment
when,
if
i
am
a
criminal,
i
am
called
upon
directly
for
information
as
to
the
acts
done,
i
may
refuse
to
answer.
that
is
an
actionable
to
say
from
a
criminal
standpoint.
concealment
is
really
only
a
motive
and
a
joint
intention
to
conceal
becomes
criminal
only
when
there
is
an
agreement
upon
some
criminal
act.
so
that
even
after
a
crime
has
been
committed
and
even
if
the
party
is
intended
to
do
some
concealing,
you
don't
get
into
a
criminal
conspiracy
until
you
find
them
combining
at
sometime
later
to
join
in
some
criminal
act
and
then
you
have
a
new
conspiracy.
you
don't
have
the
old
act,
the
old
criminal
conspiracy
brought
down
today.
here
you
have
a
conspiracy
which
we
must
assume
was
found
by
the
verdict
of
the
jury
to
bring
about
these
corrupt
acts.
it
was
clearly
on
the
record,
accomplished
by
january
1949,
possibly
as
i
say
and
i
don't
need
to
go
into
the
details,
some
incident
in
1950
but
still
well
beyond
the
limitation
period.
we
have
nothing
in
the
limitation
period
of
three
years
before
october
25,
1954
except
an
act
of
concealment,
an
individual
act
of
one
or
the
other
of
the
conspirators
trying
to
cover
up
just
as
you
have
in
the
lutwak
case,
just
as
you
have
in
the
krulewitch
case.
mr.
edward
j.
bennett
for
conspiracy
to
defraud
the
united
states
in
the
administration
of
the
revenue
department
--
mr.
edward
j.
bennett
--
prosecution
of
offenses
against
the
revenue.
mr.
edward
j.
bennett
well,
it's
--
mr.
edward
j.
bennett
the
--
the
statute
--
mr.
edward
j.
bennett
quite
so,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
bennett
well,
insofar
as
these
two
taxpayers
were
concerned,
admitting
that
there
was
an
attempt
to
get
them
free
of
prosecution.
that
was
accomplished
by
january
10,
1949.
mr.
edward
j.
bennett
i
didn't
hear
you
--
mr.
edward
j.
bennett
it
--
it
might
be
if
that
essential
piece
of
evidence
would
be
part
of
their
prosecution
--
mr.
edward
j.
bennett
it
might
be
an
obstruction
of
justice.
mr.
edward
j.
bennett
yes.
i
--
i
have
no
--
mr.
edward
j.
bennett
right.
mr.
edward
j.
bennett
i
have
no
quarrel
with
any
of
those
cases,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
bennett
well
--
mr.
edward
j.
bennett
as
i
--
mr.
edward
j.
bennett
as
i
said,
it
--
it
goes
farther
than
i
need
to
go.
but
the
point
i
had
in
mind
was
this,
that
as
to
the
conspirators
themselves,
there
was
no
obligation
on
their
part
and
could
be
no
obligation
on
their
part
to
reveal
their
crime.
mr.
edward
j.
bennett
it
--
it
may
be
if
there
are
any
of
those
things
that
he
couldn't
properly
do,
for
example,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
defrauding
of
the
government
for
me
affirmatively
to
refuse
to
reveal
a
crime,
my
crime.
mr.
edward
j.
bennett
so
when
--
mr.
edward
j.
bennett
now,
there
--
mr.
edward
j.
bennett
if
--
if
he
suggest
to
someone
to
lie
to
the
government
agent
--
mr.
edward
j.
bennett
--
investigating,
yes,
that
would
--
that
might
be
--
mr.
edward
j.
bennett
that
--
that
might
be
a
new
crime.
mr.
edward
j.
bennett
well,
as
i
say
that
concealment
that
i
was
speaking
of
was
the
concealment
on
the
part
of
the
conspirators
of
them
--
themselves
of
their
own
part
in
the
crime.
and
of
course
our
position
has
been
that
in
this
particular
case,
the
scope
of
the
conspiracy
was
definitely
settled
by
the
evidence
and
it
was
over
by
january
10,
1949.
mr.
edward
j.
bennett
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
what
he
told
them
here
that
they
had
to
find
was
--
was
this
conspiracy
over
january
10,
1949
wasn't
a
conspiracy
to
conceal.
