mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
by
reason
of
the
limitations
in
this
court's
order
granting
certiorari,
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
support
the
jury's
verdict
is
not
now
open
for
consideration.
on
this
review,
we
must
assume
under
the
questions
which
the
court
agreed
to
consider
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
before
the
jury
to
prove
the
participation
of
each
one
of
these
petitioners
in
a
conspiracy
to
defraud
the
united
states
and
the
administration
of
the
income
tax
law.
but
although
it
is
--
it
is
not
necessary
to
review
the
evidence
on
the
substantive
issue
of
guilt,
the
nature
of
the
conspiracy
is
important
in
determining
the
application
of
this
statute
of
limitations.
this
is
so
since
the
various
acts
which
took
place
within
the
period
not
barred
by
the
statute
must
have
been
found
by
the
jury
under
the
proper
instructions
to
be
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy
if
they
would
prevent
the
running
of
the
statute.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
a
question
and
that
is
a
question
of
judgment
as
to
whether
that
error
is
sufficient
as
to
the
other
defendants
so
that
it
should
be
reversed
as
to
them.
we
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
the
dissenting
judge
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
--
and
then
if
you
did
reach
that
point,
then
you'd
have
to
consider
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
find
out
whether
it
was
material
or
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
and
the
seriousness
of
the
impeachment.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
government's
case
rests
upon
its
proof
of
a
single
continuing
conspiracy
to
defraud.
if
the
petitioners
are
correct
in
their
assertions
that
the
government
proved
a
separate
and
distinct
conspiracy
to
hide
the
taxes,
the
criminal
tax
acts
of
the
particular
taxpayers,
then
our
argument
would
be
more
difficult
because
while
secrecy
in
that
case
would
be
also
a
necessary
problem
of
the
wrong
doing,
we
would
then
have
a
situation
much
closer
to
the
one
that
we
had
in
the
krulewitch
case,
any
of
the
--
of
the
lutwak
case
where
there's
a
specific
criminal
act
which
was
--
had
a
beginning
and
an
ending
and
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
secrecy
in
connection
with
that
particular
offense
extended
the
statute.
but
in
this
case,
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury
on
the
theory
that
there
was
a
single
continuing
conspiracy,
a
tax
ring
in
effect
which
had
been
setup
in
order
to
process
cases
of
--
of
people
who
were
found
--
who
found
themselves
in
tax
difficulties.
mr.
john
f.
davis
generally.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
i
think
that
the
instructions
--
the
instructions
to
the
jury
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
the
nature
of
the
conspiracy
are
found
at
the
end
of
our
statement
on
page
36
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
of
the
government's
brief,
the
gray-covered
brief.
and
the
court
of
appeals
statement,
with
respect
to
what
is
found
on
page
45,
where
the
court
of
appeals
says,
“the
proof
of
the
existence
of
a
single,
over-all
conspiracy
is
simply
overwhelming.”
the
complicity
of
halperin
as
well
as
davis,
hoffman
and
others,
is
established
beyond,
peradventure,
of
doubt.
the
evidence
is
no
less
convincing
against
grunewald
and
bolich,
and
the
jury
were
warranted
in
drawing
the
conclusion
that
all
the
circumstances
taken
together
established
beyond
reasonable
doubt
that
grunewald
and
bolich
were
not
only
members
of
the
conspiracy,
but
that
they
were
the
fixers.
now,
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
am
not
here
adverting
to
the
--
to
the
theory
that
there
was
a
--
submitted
to
the
jury
the
question
of
the
--
whether
the
conspiracy
ended
when
they
got
the
no-prosecution
decision
or
whether
it
continued
throughout
the
period
of
limitations.
i
am
merely
adverting
now
to
the
fact
that
it
was
submitted
to
the
jury.
the
--
the
indictment
and
the
instructions
to
the
jury
to
treat
this
as
a
single
overall
conspiracy
in
which
the
co-conspirators
where
all
of
the
parties
involved
in
all
of
the
transactions.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
generally.
a
general
tax
fixing
scheme
where
they
had
setup
an
apparatus
to
--
to
process
these
cases
and
other
cases.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
they
were
certainly
a
part
of
it
and
the
people
involved
in
it
were
named
as
co-conspirators.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
that
was
the
question
the
jury
had
to
determine.
i
say
it
was
submitted
to
the
jury
as
to
whether
the
--
whether
the
conspiracy
determined
with
the
receipt
of
that
assurance
of
no
prosecution
or
whether
they
should
consider
that
there
was
a
continuing
conspiracy
with
the
element
of
concealment
understood
by
all
of
the
parties.
mr.
john
f.
davis
may
it
--
it
may
help
to
look,
too,
at
--
at
count
1
of
the
indictment
which
appears
at
page
4
of
this
long
record
in
which
describes
the
charge
as
to
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
it's
page
4
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
of
this
count,
it's
paragraph
1
of
count
1
of
the
indictment.
and
in
--
in
this,
it
is
described.
and
the
co-conspirator
are
--
are
described
as
being
one
overall
group.
i
think
the
--
that
factually,
the
closest
situation
that
we
have
to
--
to
this
situation
was
that
which
was
involved
in
the
manton
case
where
it
was
alleged
and
--
and
the
question
was
--
was
decided
on
--
on
appeal
that
there
was
a
single
conspiracy
in
that
case
by
judge
manton
and
those
associated
with
him
to
impede
justice
not
--
there
were
particular
cases
named
in
that
case
as
in
this,
but
they
were
--
they
were
in
business
of
--
of
selling
the
--
the
services
in
this
--
in
this
particular.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
they
had
--
the
jury
had
to
determine
whether
there
was
a
continuing
conspiracy
or
whether
it
ended
when
the
gotham
beef
and
the
patullo
modes
case.
i
mean
that
was
a
question
of
fact
for
the
jury
whether
it
was
a
single
conspiracy
or
whether
it
was
a
continuing
conspiracy.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
if
they
had
found
that
it
ended
with
the
decision
in
the
gotham
beef
and
patullo
--
and
patullo
modes
case,
that
would
have
been
all.
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh
yes.
there
was
evidence
with
respect
to
other
cases.
there's
one
other
case.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
glover
foundation
case,
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
those
--
the
--
there
was
--
there
was
nothing
in
that
case
within
the
term
of
the
statute.
but
i
am
now
addressing
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
--
that
is
true.
i
am
now
describing
the
nature
of
the
conspiracy
and
i
am
suggesting
that
the
nature
of
the
conspiracy
is
not
a
conspiracy
to
get
patullo
modes
off
the
hook,
to
get
gotham
beef
off
the
hook
if
they
were
part
of
it.
but
this
was
a
ring
setup.
there
was
a
law
firm
in
new
york,
schopick
&
davis
that
employed
a
--
a
man
name
hoffman
to
find
business
for
them.
find
taxpayers
who
were
in
distress.
then
they
had
mr.
halperin
in
their
office
who
was
their
contact
man
with
washington
who
was
--
who
was
a
friend
of
grunewald
and
would
come
down
and
lay
the
matter
before
grunewald.
and
grunewald
on
--
in
turn
was
a
close
associate
of
mr.
bolich.
and
mr.
bolich
was,
during
the
first
part
of
the
conspiracy,
the
chief
of
the
--
of
the
criminal
--
of
the
fraud
investigation
in
new
york.
and
during
the
latter
part
of
the
--
of
the
period
and
until
within
the
period
of
the
statute,
an
assistant
--
an
assistant
commissioner
on
bureau
of
internal
revenue.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right
and
the
question
as
to
whether
the
overt
acts
which
happened
within
the
period
of
the
statutes
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
are
in
furtherance
of
this
conspiracy.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
but
i
was
dealing
with
the
nature
of
the
conspiracy
because
that
is
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
very
important.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
you
get
from
the
indictment.
mr.
john
f.
davis
you
get
from
the
evidence
and
you
get
from
the
charge.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
could
have,
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
conspiracy
the
--
well,
the
conspiracy
was
in
term,
an
open-end
conspiracy,
the
last
--
the
last
overt
act
which
--
of
which
there
was
evidence.
and
therefore,
we
can
accept
that
as
the
last
--
the
end
of
the
conspiracy
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned
was
in
may
of
1952.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
act
was
--
well,
i
think
its
appropriate
at
this
time
for
me
to
name
the
six
acts,
all
of
the
six
acts
which
occurred
within
the
period
of
the
statute
of
limitations
of
which
this
is
one,
if
--
if
your
honor
pleases.
mr.
john
f.
davis
because
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
we
must
--
well,
these
--
i
don't
think
there's
any
particular
importance
in
any
one
of
them.
there
were
six
acts
which
occurred
within
three
years
of
the
date
--
of
the
--
of
the
finding
of
the
indictment.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
think
they're
all
important.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
mean
i
think
they
are
all
in
furtherance.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
--
if
this
court
finds
that
anyone
of
these
is
an
act
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
that
is
sufficient
to
bring
the
conspiracy
within
the
statute
of
limitations.
i
think
that
anyone
of
them
is
sufficient.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
relate
to
concealment,
all
of
them.
they
--
that
is
right.
they
all
relate
to
concealment,
but
may
i
say
that
there
may
be
a
difference
between
--
the
very
nature
of
this
conspiracy
makes
this
different
from
the
krulewitch
or
the
lutwak
case.
mr.
john
f.
davis
pardon?
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
might
make
two
conspiracies
unless
the
jury
on
the
proper
instructions
found
that
it
was
a
--
a
single
conspiracy.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
what
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
if
your
honor
pleases.
and
i
refer
again
to
the
manton
case.
a
conspiracy
may
have
a
number
of
unlawful
objects.
it
may
have
the
unlawful
object
of
defrauding
the
united
states
as
it
did
in
the
manton
case.
it
may
have
the
unlawful
object
also
of
impeding
justice
in
violation
of
a
particular
statute
as
was
present
in
the
manton
case.
and
it
may,
in
addition,
have
the
additional
unlawful
object
of
concealing
misdeeds
of
government
officials
which
we
say
was
involved
in
this
case.
there
are
various
objects
of
a
single
conspiracy,
if
the
conspiracy
is
knit
together
as
a
single
plan
of
unlawful
conduct.
that
is
what
we
mean
by
a
single
--
by
a
conspiracy,
a
single
conspiracy.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
could.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
don't
think
the
government
can
do
it.
but
i'd
submit
to
the
charging.
i
think
that
it
has
to
charge
and
prove
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
in
which
all
of
these
parties
were
participating,
a
single
conspiracy
which
had
these
objectives
and
on
which
they
acted.
i
don't
--
i
--
i
think
that
unless
you
can
prove
the
coexistence,
the
--
the
fact
that
--
and
i
think
that's
what
the
charge
in
this
court
asked
the
jury
to
define.
whether
or
not
this
was
one
of
the
items
of
agreement
among
these
parties
at
the
time
they
formed
this
scheme.
whether
--
whether
this
was
one
of
the
objectives
they
had.
i
don't
think
that
any
--
any
act
of
--
of
criminality
involved
certain
secrecy.
there's
no
question
about
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
whether
they
could
be
separated
if
it
were
a
single
conspiracy,
i
don't
know.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
well,
there's
query
whether
it
could
be
charged
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
as
a
separate
count.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
mean
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
multiplicity
of
--
of
--
if
you
can
make
too
many
crimes
out
of
one
crime,
why,
one's
in
difficulty.
there
are
two.
it's
a
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
question
judgment
in
these
cases.
the
manton
case
deals
with
this
specific
problem
and
deals
with
it
rather
well
in
saying
that
if
you
have
a
single
conspiracy
in
which
you
have
a
number
of
illegal
objects,
that
doesn't
make
a
number
of
conspiracies.
it's
still
a
single
conspiracy.
and
--
and
that's
a
--a
factual
question
which
must
be
presented
to
the
jury
under
proper
instruction.
so,
the
jury
can
determine
whether
or
not
the
evidence
supports
this
theory.d
the
government
can't
make
the
case
because
all
the
government
can
do
is
to
--
is
to
present
the
--
the
evidence
and
let
the
jury
pass
upon
it
under
proper
instructions.
i
may
say
though,
that
these
acts
of
--
this
--
this
case
--
these
acts
of
concealment,
many
of
the
acts
of
concealment
in
this
case
are
not
afterthoughts.
they're
not
something
that
comes
on
after
the
illegal
action
is
complete.
the
acts
of
concealment
in
this
case
started
with
the
conspiracy
itself.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
and
these
overt
acts
that
i
am
now
referring
to
are
not
the
acts
of
concealment
which
occurred
early
in
the
conspiracy.
although,
there
were
many
acts
of
concealment
which
occurred
right
from
the
beginning.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
these
--
these
are
the
--
the
overt
acts
of
concealment
which
occurred
within
the
period,
which
is
not
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations.
and
there
were
six
separate
acts
in
which
there
was
evidence
going
to
the
jury.
i
may
say
that
some
help
on
this
--
the
--
the
printed
activity
in
a
footnote
to
judge
frank's
second
opinion
in
this
case.
and
that
may
be
of
some
--
some
help.
on
page
382
(a)
of
volume
5
of
the
appendix
so-called.
it's
the
second
--
it's
actually
the
second
volume
of
the
record
in
this
case
and
judge
--
mr.
john
f.
davis

i
think
they're
all
a's.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
it's
the
white-covered

was
actually

this

this
volume

the
opinions
of
the
court
of
appeals.

this
opinion
here
as
judge
frank's
dissenting
opinion
on
rehearing
in
which
he
deals
with
this
question
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
and
he
had
set
forth
in
footnote
2
on
page
382,
these
--
these
overt
acts
which
occurred
after
october
25,
1951.
now,
these
are
what
happened.
when
mr.
smith,
who
was
an
accountant
for
patullo
modes
was
subpoenaed
before
the
king
committee
in
december,
remember
in
december
1951,
mr.
schopick
suggested
to
him.
mr.
schopick
is
one
of
the
conspirators.
schopick
&
davis,
suggested
to
him
that
he
lie
to
the
king
committee
about
a
$500
check
which
had
actually
been
issued
to
pay
a
man
named
(inaudible)
for
making
the
initial
contact
between
the
tax-fixing
ring
at
patullo
modes.
and
mr.
smith
was
requested,
according
to
the
evidence,
to
tell
the
grand
jury
that
this
payment
was
made
as
an
indirect
loan
from
a
man
name
hoffman
who
was
connected
to
the
ring
to
(inaudible)
who
was
his
brother-in-law.
that
is
an
overt
act
of
concealment
taking
place
in
december
1951.
second,
in
the
december
1951,
mr.
bolich
who
was,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
the
official
connected
with
internal
revenue
bureau.
in
1951,
he
had
a
telephone
conversation
with
the
manager
of
the
washington
hotel.
and
mr.
bolich
had
shared
roomy
--
rooms
with
mr.
grunewald
in
the
washington
hotel
and
had
asked
the
management
of
the
washington
hotel
to
let
him
have
the
records
that
involved
payments
of
various
telephone
calls,
reference
text
and
so
forth.
in
1951,
he
had
a
telephone
call
with
the
management
of
the
washington
hotel
in
which
he
stated
that
he
--
he
denied
having
those
records.
that
is
the
second
act
within
the
period
of
limitations.
in
may
of
1952,
when
mr.
grunewald's
secretary
was
subpoenaed
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury,
mr.
grunewald
called
her
and
suggested
that
she
need
not
remember
events
which
had
occurred
in
his
office.
and
he
sent
her
money
to
pay
her
expenses
to
new
york
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury,
which
he
incidentally
(inaudible)
that's
the
third.
the
fourth
act
occurred
in
march
1952.
at
this
time,
the
patullo
modes
people
had
decided
to
cooperate
with
the
--
with
the
grand
jury.
they
had
retained
new
counsel
apart
from
the
counsel
involved
in
this
conspiracy.
and
the
new
york
members
of
the
ring
learned
that
they
had
been
talking
with
other
counsel
and
that
they
intended
to
tell
the
whole
story
to
the
grand
jury
decided
to
make
a
last
minute
effort
to
dissuade
them.
and
four
members
of
the
conspiracy,
meeting
together,
discussed
what
could
be
done
about
it
and
it
was
decided
that
one
of
them,
i
think
it
was
mr.
davis,
should
talk
with
these
people
and
try
to
dissuade
them.
and
he
did,
in
fact,
talk
with
max
and
with
mrs.
segel,
both
connected
with
the
taxpayer
and
urge
them
not
to
make
the
disclosures
to
the
grand
jury.
mr.
john
f.
davis
of
these
four,
grunewald
and
bolich
as
far
as
individuals
involved.
but
may
i
say
--
may
i
say,
your
honor,
that
i
would
say
that
this
overt
acts
are
equally
binding
by
mr.
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
in
the
fifth
and
sixth
while
mr.
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
not
in
those.
he
appears
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
that
--
that
is
right.
they
were
not
all
involved
in
any
one
of
these
acts.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
fifth
and
sixth
overt
acts,
which
i
have
referred
to
be
together,
were
meetings
by
mr.
halperin
and
mr.
davis
with
the
taxpayers
involved,
the
other
taxpayers.
it's
called
the
gotham
beef
company.
and
they
--
when
--
when
word
got
around
that
the
--
the
patullo
modes
people
were
--
were
telling
that
story
to
the
grand
jury,
it
became
important,
that
if
possible,
to
keep
the
gotham
beef
--
beef
people
from
telling
their
story.
and
there
were
meetings
in
february
of
1952
and
in
march
of
1952
participated
in
by
both
davis
and
halperin
in
which
the
attempt
was
made
to
keep
these
people
from
talking
to
the
grand
jury.
and
those
are
the
six
overt
acts.
and
all
of
them
deal
with
concealment
although
whether
its
concealment
to
protect
the
conspirators
or
concealment
to
prevent
reopening
of
the
criminal
cases,
i
cannot
tell.
it
would
be
concealment
for
all
purposes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no
--
no,
he
did
not.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
f.
davis
what
--
what
i
--
what
i
will
say
now,
is
that
an
overt
act
of
concealment
if
made
by
anyone
of
the
conspirators
in
order
to
carry
out
the
purpose,
the
objectives
of
the
conspiracy,
will
keep
the
conspiracy
alive
as
to
the
entire
group
even
though
it's
an
individual
act
and
even
though
there
is
no
knowledge
of
that
act
--
of
that
specific
act,
if
i
may
say,
by
the
other
conspirators.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
all
are
bound
by
this
act.
mr.
john
f.
davis
so,
the
real
question
before
this
court
is
whether,
pursuant
to
proper
instructions,
the
jury
could
have
found
that
these
acts
were
in
furtherance
of
the
objectives
of
a
conspiracy,
single
conspiracy
entered
into
by
all
of
the
parties.
the
instructions
to
the
--
of
the
judges
set
forth
at
page
36
and
37
of
--
of
our
brief.
and
they
are
very
specific
that
--
that
concealment
must
have
been,
must
have
been
considered
an
objective
of
the
conspiracy
and
must
have
been
known
by
the
conspirators
to
be
such.
mr.
john
f.
davis
for
any
illegal
purpose.
he
did
not
go
into
the
question
as
to
whether
it
was
to
protect
the
taxpayers
or
to
protect
the
conspirators.
he
said,
if
one
the
purposes
of
the
conspiracy
was
to
conceal,
like
continuing
concealment,
if
that
was
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
--
of
the
conspiracy,
it
would
--
it
would
be
enough.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
it
wouldn't
because
i
think
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
that
then
you
would
be
using
the
overt
acts
after
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
what
would
otherwise
be
the
completion
of
the
crime
just
to
keep
it
alive
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
and
i
think
that's
what
krulewitch
was
trying
to
prevent.
mr.
john
f.
davis
not,
necessarily,
your
honor.
not
if
one
of
the
elements
of
the
conspiracy
itself,
the
original
conspiracy,
before
the
(inaudible)
of
carrying
on
their
--
their
taxes.
in
--
in
order
to
maintain
the
ring,
in
order
to
keep
it
going,
one
of
the
objects,
let's
assume
that
they
reduced
it
to
writing
in
which,
of
course,
they
don't.
but
let's
assume
that
we
have
a
conspiracy
where
they
all
sign
in
--
in
--
under
the
document
or
something.
and
they
say,
the
objects
of
this
conspiracy
are
to
fix
taxes.
and
we
cannot
keep
this
going
unless
we
keep
quiet
that
our
man
in
washington
is
bolich.
if
any
taxpayers
learned
that
our
man
in
washington
is
bolich
and
grunewald,
that's
also
--
we
must
agree
that
whatever
happens,
we
will
keep
that
quiet.
and
everyone
signed
it.
all
of
the
parties,
grunewald,
bolich
relied
on
it.
that
would
be
one
of
the
objects
in
the
conspiracy.
and
there'd
be
no
question,
i
think,
that
so
long
as
they
were
carrying
out
that
object
of
maintaining
that
secrecy
that
they
were
carrying
out
one
of
the
unlawful
objects
which
they
have,
confederate
together,
to
perform.
now,
justice
--
judge
frank
in
his
--
in
his
dissent,
draws
a
very
strong
distinction
and
says,
you
can
imply
from
overt
acts,
a
conspiracy
to
protect
the
taxpayers
but
you
cannot
imply
conspiracy
to
maintain
the
--
the
ring
in
effect.
and
that
i
--
i
respectfully
differ.
i
think
that's
the
issue
before
this
court,
whether
--
whether
he
is
right
in
that.
if
he
is
right
in
that,
why,
then
we
are
wrong
in
our
--
in
our
petition
here.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
you're
quite
right,
mr.
justice
douglas.
i
didn't
mean
to
refer
to
the
manton
case
as
being
a
concealment
case.
i
don't
think
there's
anything
in
it
that
helps
us
on
concealment.
i
refer
to
the
manton
case
because
it
seems
to
me
the
closest
case
that
i
find
in
the
books
factually
to
illustrate
what
i
mean
by,
in
this
case
a
tax
ring,
in
that
case,
it
was
a
ring
to
--
to
sell
justice
in
--
in
the
second
circuit.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it's
now
five
years.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
was
three
years
when
this
was
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
although
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
that's
what
i
was
about
to
say.
i
can
think
that
part
of
my
reasoning
in
this
goes
to
do
the
--
the
use
of
the
conspiracy
statute
to
reach
a
mann
act
violation
that
was
involved
in
the
krulewitch
case.
two
people
were
involved
in
--
in
the
mann
act
there
that
--
and
it's
a
very
different
situation
where
you
have
an
open-end
apparatus,
a
ring
such
as
involved
here
or
in
the
--
or
in
the
manton
case
or
in
the
haas
against
henkel
case
where
there's
a
continuing
effort
and
--
and
the
--
the
objective
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
not
necessarily,
if
they
say
let
us
go
in
as
long
we
can
--
just
as
long
as
mr.
bolich's
in
a
position
to
do
us
any
good.
i
don't
know.
they
--
that
these
things
--
these
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
these
conspiracies
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
think
that
in
--
in
essence
with
the
one
which
put
to
the
jury.
whether
there
was
a
continuing
conspiracy
to
sell.
mr.
john
f.
davis
pardon?
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
you
have
to
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
you
need
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
you
need
some
proof
--
you
need
some
proof
of
the
continuation
of
this
--
of
the
conspiracy
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
to
put
in
the
statute.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think,
though
if
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think,
your
honor
--
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
courts
have
said
that
there
must
be
evident
of
--
evidence
of
overt
acts
within
the
term
of
the
statute
in
order
that
you
have
the
content
--
the
--
the
conspiracy.
i
wouldn't
think
it
would
be
necessary
if
you
had
a
--a
firm
agreement
for
five
years.
i
--
i
don't
see
any
--
then
that
would,
to
my
mind,
unless
there
were
some
evidence
of
abandonment.
then
you
wouldn't
have
to
have
the
overt
acts.
but
if
you
had
open-end
agreement,
you
have
to
have
some
evidence
to
the
jury.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
that
is
right.
you've
got
to
--
you've
got
to
establish
that
these
parties
got
together
and
made
this
time
as
an
agreement
in
the
beginning.
if
it's
just
a
case
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
of
that
saving
their
skins
in
the
end,
by
then
you
cannot
extend
the
statute
that
way.
that's
attacking
--
that's
what
was
wrong
with
krulewitch.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
but
you
can
prove
the
continuation
of
the
conspirators
--
the
conspiracy
as
long
as
the
conspirators
are
carrying
on
acts
in
accordance
with
their
original
agreement.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
--
it
could.
i
mean
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
would
be
a
--
if
the
jury
determined
on
proper
instructions
that
this
act
was
pursuant
to
the
original
conspiracy
then
this
--
that
would
keep
it
alive.
i
mean
there
would
be
evidence
on
which
the
jury
could
recently
make
that
finding.
mr.
john
f.
davis
five
or
ten
or
twenty
five
years
thereafter.
mr.
john
f.
davis
you
mean
the
last
preceding
overt
act
of
the
conspiracy.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
would
be
very
--
i'm
not
sure
that
the
jury's
verdict
could
be
upheld
in
a
case
like
that.
i
mean
it
would
be
a
question
that
whether
there
were
sufficient
evidence
on
which
a
jury
could
reasonably
find
a
continuation
through
that
very
act.
and
i
think
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
uphold
a
verdict
where
there
has
been
a
period
of
that
--
of
that
duration.
then
it
looks
as
though
this
was
a
supplemental
act
or
something
that
someone
did
not
pursuant
to
the
original
conspiracy.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
such
lapse.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
they
were
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
think
it'd
be
a
question
for
the
jury.
and
then
a
question
as
to
whether
that
was
a
reasonable
thing.
in
this
--
the
facts
of
this
case,
however,
there
were
continuous
acts
which
the
--
which
the
record
shows
from
1949,
when
the
original
no-
prosecution
decision
was
made,
right
up
through
by
--
recited
these
six
acts
which
occurred
after
the
--
it
--
within
the
period
of
--
of
the
statute.
but
for
example,
mr.
grunewald's
secretary
testified
that
during
this
interim
period
which
we're
talking
about
that
mr.
halperin
came
down
to
see
mr.
grunewald
10
times
in
this
period
between
after
the
conclusion
of
the
--
the
no
prosecution
and
these
overt
acts
that
we're
talking
about.
so
that
this
isn't
a
--
a
case
of
going
back
and
resurrecting
a
--
a
dead
conspiracy
in
this
case.
the
evidence
in
the
case
shows
a
continuation
of
this
association
together.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right,
your
honor.
they
did.
all
of
these
that
occurred
after
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
october
25,
1951.
but
i
do
not
mean
by
to
that
imply
that
nothing
happened
between
and
between
the
fixing
of
the
particular
cases
and
these
acts.
they
didn't
act
within
the
--
they
didn't
come
within
the
period
of
the
statute.
and
so
they're
not
overt
acts
which
will
keep
the
statute
aligned.
but
they
prevent
--
they
give
substance
to
the
jury's
finding
that
these
particular
acts
were
in
furtherance
of
a
continuing
conspiracy
because
it
was
continuing
throughout
the
period.
mr.
john
f.
davis
did
they
occur
after
the
--
the
alleged
member
of
the
conspiracy
with
where
the
government
had
left
it?
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i
think
not.
he
left
in
december
of
--
december
of
1951.
i
don't
think
they
were
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh
some
of
this
occurred
before
he
left
and
some
after,
the
once
that
--
they
--
they
occurred.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
--
that's
right.
most
of
them
occurred
after
he
had
left
the
government.
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
no,
i
think
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i
think
there
could
be
--
we
could
make
no
claim
that
the
tax
ring
was
in
business
after
mr.
bolich
left
the
government.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
that
put
an
end
to
--
to
any
attempt
to
fix
new
tax
cases.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
was
in
1951,
early
in
1951.
mr.
john
f.
davis
must
it
--
it
may
have
been
1950.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
may.
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
no,
1951.
i
think,
your
honor
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
but
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
king
and
the
keene
committee
had
changed
from
one
to
the
other
but
that
they
were
before
the
grand
jury.
they
were
in
1950
or
1951,
i
think.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
don't
know
how
seriously
they
took
it.
i
don't
think
they
could
get
very
much
new
business
while
the
king
committee
and
the
keene
committee
were
on
that
trail.
mr.
john
f.
davis
february
1951,
if
you're
going
to
page
30
of
our
brief.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
think
that
that
certainly
put
a
--
put
a
handicap
in
the
new
business.
mr.
john
f.
davis
1951,
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
and
i
can
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
give
you
the
precise
date
in
the
exhibits
to
this
page.
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon.
it's
november
--
november
16th,
1951.
mr.
john
f.
davis
1951.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
it's
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
no.
that
isn't
what
i
meant.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
meant
that
on
his
leaving
the
government,
they
could
no
longer
get
new
--
process
to
new
business.
they
could
no
longer
hold
themselves
out
as
a
tax
fixing
ring.
mr.
john
f.
davis
not
all
of
them.
one
of
them
occurred
before
but
the
others
after.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
december
1951.
no.
there
are
two
in
december.
oh,
he'd
left
in
november.
i
beg
your
pardon.
they
all
occurred
after
that.
mr.
john
f.
davis
everyone
occurred
after
he
had
left.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
of
new
business.
but
our
--
our
theory
is
that
the
objects
of
the
conspiracy
on
testifying
concealment
and
this
is
what
the
court
--
the
--
the
trial
court
instructed
the
jury.
you
have
to
find
the
concealment.
it
was
also
an
object
of
the
initial
conspiracy.
if
this
was
a
--
if
this
conspiracy
depend
solely
upon
tax
fixing,
if
it
ends
when
they
can
no
longer
get
new
clients,
it
ends
when
bolich
leaves
the
government.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and,
if
i
may
say,
if
i
may
add
to
that,
and
also
to
conceal
the
acts
of
tax
fixing.
and
maybe
that's
partially
to
protect
the
taxpayers
and
partly
to
protect
the
conspirators.
but
the
--
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
indictment
itself
includes
the
concealment
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
it
isn't
mentioned
as
such.
it
just
mentioned
conspiracy
to
--
to
protect
the
conspirators
and
the
conspirators
--
named
conspirators
enclosed
the
taxpayers.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
--
well,
they
can
still
protect
the
tax
--
the
taxpayers,
too.
i
mean,
they
still
can,
assuming
for
a
minute
it
is
important
that
judge
frank
thought
it
was
to
distinguish
between
the
two.
the
conspirators
are
still
under
an
obligation
insofar
as
conspirators
are
to
try
and
protect
these
taxpayers
from
the
fraud
being
disclosed
and
the
criminal
cases
reopened
against
the
taxpayers.
and
as
the
--
bolich
being
in
the
--
in
the
bureau
isn't
essential
to
carrying
out
that
object
of
the
conspiracy.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
our
specific
position.
and
then
this,
i
think,
a
position
which
is
recognized
as
--
as
possible
in
both
krulewitch
and
in
lutwak,
too.
mr.
john
f.
davis
during
the
--
the
life
of
--
of
the
statute
of
limitations
against
those
people.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
may
i
say
this.
then
it
may
clarify
it.
there
is
a
six-year
statute.
there
was
a
six-year
statute
with
respect
to
the
tax
liability
end
of
--
end
of
it.
it's
a
separate
statute,
which
extends
within
this
period.
so
that
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
would
be
--
yes.
there
would
certainly
be
enough
to
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
establish
concealment.
but
not
--
not
acts
within
the
period.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
these
six
acts?
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
there
is
ample,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i'll
give
you
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i'll
give
you
--
i
wouldn't
--
i
will
give
you
give
a
--
a
few
examples.
i
--
i
want
to
get,
if
i
can,
the
fifth
amendment
problem
here
for
a
minute
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
but
i
do
want
to
--
this
is
very
important.
one
thing
was
in
agreement,
for
example,
that
they
would
not
tell
the
names
of
the
washington
people.
and
there's
evidence
in
the
record
from
repeated
witnesses
that
when
the
new
york
conspirators
were
asked
about
who
were
involved
in
--
in
washington,
they
refused
to
disclose
the
names.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
may
well
be.
but
here
is
evidence
of
--
an
--
of
a
agreement,
a
--
a
joint
effort
to
conceal
the
--
the
names
of
the
washington
group.
now,
there
is
an
another
example.
at
the
time
davis
and
schopick
were
engaged
in
trying
to
get
the
no-prosecution
agreement,
the
patullo
modes
stock
enterprise
retained
separate
lawyers,
saver
&
schwaeber,
i
think
their
names
were.
and
then
the
question
came
up
when
--
when
they
were
making
progress,
“should
these
people,
the
separate
law
firm,
be
dismissed?”
and
mr.
grunewald
is,
according
to
the
evidence,
advised
that
we
keep
saver
&
schwaeber
in
the
picture.
they
were
the
legitimate
lawyers.
i
mean
they
had
no
--
no
part
in
the
ring.
they'd
be
retained,
and
actually
they
were
paid
$15,000,
to
be
a
part
of
a
legitimate
front
for
the
--
for
the
settlement
of
this
tax
claim.
and
the
conspirators
cold-bloodedly
agreed
that
this
$15,000
in
effect
should
be
spent
in
order
to
have
this
front.
now,
this
--
there
are
other
elements.
take
for
example,
the
payments
in
the
case.
they
were
involved
in
these
two
particular
cases
we've
talked
about.
there
were
$160,000
paid.
now,
it's
interesting
the
difference
in
the
way
these
payments
were
made
and
the
payments
of
the
fees
that
were
paid
for
the
lawyers.
these
payments
were
all
made
in
cash.
they
are
made
in
--
in
bills.
bills,
moreover,
which
were
not
supposed
to
be
of
too
large
denominations.
bills
which
were
to
be
obtained
not
by
selling
assets
which
could
be
traced,
not
by
withdrawing
money
out
of
bank
accounts
which
could
be
traced,
but
money
which
could
be
obtained
by
the
taxpayers
to
make
these
payments
without
there
being
any
--
any
method
of
--
of
tracing
them.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
don't
--
i
don't
know.
it
is
an
act
of
--
it
is
an
agreement,
a
--
an
conspiratorial
attempt
to
conceal
in
connection
with
this
over
--
overriding
conspiracy.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
--
i
think,
your
honor,
that
it
can
be
submitted
to
the
--
to
the
jury
as
this
judge
did
whether
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
determine
that
these
people
agreed
on
concealment.
and
that
when
the
jury
finds
that
there
was
--
that
was
in
the
term
of
the
agreement,
that
this
court
would
not
be
in
a
position
to
reverse
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
concealment
of
the
elements.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
well,
the
--
yes
there
is
the
king
committee.
there
was
an
attempt
to
try
and
prevent
them
from
talking
before
the
congressional
committees.
mr.
john
f.
davis
which
is
--
which
is
of
the
same
nature
and
which
occurs
in
the
--
in
this
interim
period.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no
--
no,
until
--
until
the
committee
started,
i
didn't
--
i
don't
find
any
--
any
overt
acts
in
connection
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
first
acts
are
involved
during
1927
and
1948.
and
the
--
it
runs
through
to
the
attempt
to
get
the
clover
foundation
in
1949.
and
that
was
the
last
major
outside
contract.
mr.
john
f.
davis
1951.
and
i
think
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
when
the
king
committee
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
again,
that
depends
on
the
question
which
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i'm
--
i'm
sorry
i
haven't
reviewed
the
evidence
to
put
that
mind
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
but
i
think
it
was
davis
--
davis,
schopick
and
--
and
hoffman
in
new
york.
maybe
mr.
halperin,
too.
i
don't
remember.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
with
the
tax
--
with
the
taxpayers.
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
they
tried
to
get
the
taxpayers
not
to
tell
the
stories
to
the
--
to
the
committee.
mr.
john
f.
davis
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
--
i
think
that
it
is
a
very
important
issue
and
i'm
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
i'm
sorry
i
used
all
the
time
on
the
others
because
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
we
did
it,
actually.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i'm
turning
then,
if
i
may,
to
the
fifth
amendment
question
and
at
the
present
time.
what
happened
--
what
the
--
what
actually
happened
was
this.
mr.
halperin
who
is
one
of
the
defendants
in
the
case
took
the
stand
in
his
own
defense.
and
he
testified
extensively
and
explicitly
with
relation
to
--
with
reference
to
his
business
relationships
with
schopick
&
davis,
his
knowledge
with
the
patullo
modes
and
the
gotham
beef's
matter
and
his
own
relationships
with
grunewald.
now,
he
denies
all
guilt,
whatsoever.
and
he
contradicted
a
great
many
of
the
evidentiary
details,
which
witnesses
for
the
government
had
presented.
on
cross-examination,
over
objection
of
counsel,
he
was
asked
concerning
action
which
he
had
taken
before
the
brooklyn
grand
jury
where
he
had
answered
some
of
these
very
questions,
which
were
presented
to
him
here,
but
had
claimed
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
with
respect
to
some
of
the
very
questions
which
he
answered
on
trial.
the
witness
pointed
out
that
he
claimed
this
privilege
before
the
grand
jury
because
he
didn't
have
the
right
of
cross-examination,
he
wasn't
represented
by
counsel.
and
he
claimed
that
he
felt
that
he
was
innocent
then.
and
he
felt
that
he
was
innocent,
now.
the
court
instructed
the
jury
that
the
assertion
of
the
privilege,
not
to
incriminate
oneself,
may
not
be
taken
by
the
jury
as
a
basis
from
which
the
jury
can
draw
any
inference
of
guilt.
and
then
the
judge
told
the
jury
that
it
could
consider
the
prior
claim
and
this
is
--
this
instruction
is
quoted
on
our
brief
at
page
68
and
69.
he
could
--
the
jury
could
consider
the
prior
claim
of
privilege
for
the
sole
purpose
of
ascertaining
the
weight
you
choose
to
give
his
present
testimony
with
respect
to
the
same
matters
upon
which
he
previously
invoked
his
privilege.
and
the
question
before
us
is
whether
these
are
proper
instructions
and
whether
it
was
proper
to
permit
the
--
the
witness
to
be
examined
with
respect
to
his
prior
claim
of
privilege.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
don't
think
all
of
the
minutes
were
made
available.
mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
halperin's
testimony
was
certainly
made
available
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
to
mr.
singer.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
yes.
the
--
the
--
there
were
great
many
claims
and
in
general,
he
claimed
the
--
the
privilege
in
--
in
perfectly
formal
fashion
as
a
lawyer
would
asserting
his
claim
privilege
on
the
basis
of
this
may
tend
and
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
he
was
always
careful
as
they
may
tend
to
incriminate
me.
and
then,
he
explained
to
the
grand
jury,
although
the
record
is
--
is
a
little
unclear,
but
it's
in
this
record
here.
he
explained
to
them
that
he
believed
he
was
innocent.
that
this
--
he
didn't
want
admitting
any
detail.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
and
he
said
that
he
didn't
want
to
talk
there
because
this
--
and
this
--
it's
a
little
garbled,
but
i
would
interpret
what
he
said
as
meaning
that
he
didn't
have
the
right
of
cross-examination.
he
preferred
to
talk
where
he
confronted
the
witnesses
and
had
a
basis
for
cross-examination.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
think
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
he
was
subpoenaed
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
john
f.
davis
in
brooklyn,
it
was
the
brooklyn
grand
jury.
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
pardon?
mr.
john
f.
davis
in
--
in
the
southern
district
in
manhattan.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
that
was
in
(inaudible)
and
the
first
one
was
technically
in
the
eastern
district
but
this
called
throughout
this
record,
the
brooklyn
grand
jury.
now,
this
--
this
issue
of
a
witness
taking
the
stand
and
being
queried
as
to
prior
inconsistent
position,
is
not
new.
it
was
before
this
court
specifically
in
raffel
against
the
united
states.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
--
i
--
the
question
is
can
it
be
distinguished?
that's
right.
is
--
is
that
it
--
or
whether
--
well,
that's
not
the
nub
of
the
case.
judge
frank
also
said
that
he
felt
that
this
court
would
--
would
not
follow
raffel
today.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
you
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
--
the
--
well,
let
me
ask
you
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
question
is
where
there
is
some
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
whether
there
is
some
particular
additional
protection
given
because
the
silence
was
made
under
the
claim
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
think
that
--
i
--
i
don't
think
that
really
--
in
--
in
raffel,
i
also
stated
the
grounds
that
he
just
did
--
he
wasn't
because
he
was
guilty.
it's
because
his
lawyer
told
him.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
i
think
that
that
is
a
matter,
if
i
may
say
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
a
matter
for
the
jury
to
weigh
in
determining
whether
there
is
inconsistency.
i
don't
think
that
is
a
--
it
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
it
should
go
to
the
jury.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
massachusetts
case
is
certainly
--
support
that
position.
may
i
then
refer
to
the
cases
which
had
followed
raffel.
raffel
--
the
raffel
case
was
decided
in
1926,
i
believe.
1926
by
--
by
justice
stone.
since
then,
there
have
been
a
great
many
cases
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
although
not
before
this
court,
in
which
the
issue
of
the
raffel
case
has
been
before
the
courts
of
appeals.
i
have
cited
on
page
73
of
our
brief,
a
group
of
cases
which
deal
with
this
specific
problem
where
the
prior
claim
was
made
in
a
grand
jury.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
--
but
judge
--
justice
stone
in
the
raffel
case
itself
had
a
situation
where
the
man
--
he
didn't
--
and
i'm
not
sure
that
he
said
he
was
innocent.
but
he
did
say,
“i
am
making
this
claim
because
my
lawyer
tells
me
to.”
i
mean
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
justice
stone
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
felt
it
should
be
applied
in
the
raffel
situation.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
justice
stone
not
--
didn't
reach
his
decision
solely
by
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
reference
to
the
massachusetts
court.
he
has
a
--
well
a
--
a
reasoned
opinion
here
which
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
i
think
that's
right.
and
there
is
this
distinction
which
justice
stone
doesn't
--
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
specifically
refer
to.
although
it's
present
in
--
in
this
case.
and
the
raffel
case,
i
think
the
facts
should
be
stated
if
only
briefly.
raffel
was
under
trial
for
a
violation
of
the
prohibition
act.
and
a
prohibition
agent
testified
that
mr.
raffel
had
stated
that
he
owned
the
premises.
in
this
trial,
mr.
raffel
didn't
take
the
stand.
and
the
jury
failed
to
reach
a
verdict
in
that
case.
there
was
a
second
trial.
the
prohibition
agent
appeared
on
the
stand
again
and
made
exactly
the
same
--
gave
exactly
the
same
testimony.
mr.
raffel
has
--
has
admitted
--
has
stated
in
the
present
witnesses
that
he
owns
the
place.
now,
mr.
raffel
takes
the
stand
and
he
testifies
and
he
said,
“i
never
made
the
admission
which
the
--
which
the
agent
says
i
made.”
and
the
question
is,
whether
in
this
situation,
it
is
proper
to
cross-examine
him
with
respect
to
his
prior
inconsistent
position
at
the
first
trial
where
he
had
failed
to
take
the
stand.
the
problem
is
--
is
basically
one
of
--
of
waiver.
when
a
witness
chooses
--
a
defendant
in
the
case
chooses
to
appear
and
to
testify,
mr.
justice
stone
and
the
other
cases
upholding
the
right
to
cross-examine
him,
say
that
he
puts
his
credibility
on
the
line
and
he
can
be
cross-examined
as
to
--
as
any
other
witness
with
respect
to
his
--
his
past
acts.
for
example,
he
can
be
cross-examined
with
respect
to
past
criminal
acts
which
pass
--
which
would
--
would
weigh
on
--
on
the
weight
to
be
given
to
his
testimony.
if
he
has
taken
inconsistent
positions
with
respect
to
the
testimony
he
know
gives
in
a
prior
trial
that
may
be
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
jury
for
the
jury
to
weigh,
to
determine
whether
or
not
to
believe
what
he
is
saying
at
the
present
time.
and
the
nub
of
this
question,
if
i
may
say
so,
is
whether
or
not
the
protection
of
--
given
by
the
fifth
amendment
is
such
that
some
extra
special
protection
should
be
given
to
his
prior
silence
because
he
was
silent
on
a
constitutional
ground.
and
i
think
that
is
really
the
question
which
is
involved
here
whether
he
--
in
order
to
give
--
in
order
to
protect
and
you
give
an
additional
--
that
additional
honor
of
--
of
sanctity
to
his
--
to
his
prior
silence.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
is
not
--
well,
there
are
--
it's
in
--
there
are
exhibits.
that's
true.
then
it's
not
printed
in
this.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
the
exhibits
are.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
that's
right.
there
is
--
there
is
testimony.
mr.
john
f.
davis
he
was
tested
--
there
is
the
testimony
and
i
refer
your
court
--
to
the
court
generally
to
pages
691.
this
--
this
is
not
anything
that
can
be
read
at
the
moment
because
it
covers
too
long
a
period.
but
it's
691
through
about
page
696
and
i
believe
it
starts
again
and
you
have
some
on
703
to
705.
this
is
all
testimony
of
halperin
at
the
present
time
when
he
was
being
examined
as
to
his
testimony
before
the
grand
--
and
the
grand
jury
testimony
is
an
exhibit
which
is
largely
--
mr.
john

the
grand

testimony
--
mr.
john
f.

on
these
things
is
an
exhibit
which
is
lodged
with
this
court,
although,
it's
not
part
of
the
record.
but
i
mean
not
part
of
this
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
was
before
the
trial
court.
tried
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
no.
the
only
exhibit
that
is
lodged
here
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
except
--
except
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
it's
--
i
have
a
list
of
the
exhibits.
and
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
--
the
grand
jury's
testimony
is
--
exhibit
8,
but
who's
exhibit.
the
court
exhibit,
it
seems
to
say.
court
exhibit
7
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
is
halperin's
testimony
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
there
are
other
testimonies
before
the
grand
jury
appears
in
other
court
exhibit
1,
2,
3,
4.
mr.
john
f.
davis
now,
when
i
say
that
is
here
with
the
court,
i
--
we
--
we
--
the
--
the
exhibits
in
the
trial
were
sent
down
and
were
sent
over
to
the
--
to
the
--
to
this
--
to
the
clerk's
office.
i
do
not
recollect
seeing
the
grand
jury
testimony.
this
is
a
list
of
the
exhibits
that
i
have
here
which
was
with
the
volume.
i
do
not
remember
seeing
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
could
be.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
think
it
could
be
sent
down
from
--
from
the
clerk
of
the
court.
i
don't
see
any
problem
why
it
shouldn't
be.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
i
will
ask
the
same
whether
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
i
assume
the
court
understands
the
reason
i'm
back
up
here
after
the
time
that
was
given
this
morning
is
that
in
granting
certiorari
in
this
case,
the
court's
order
separated
two
questions
from
the
others
and
requested
they
be
separately
argued
and
assigned
an
hour
to
that
time
of
which
30
minutes
is
mine.
and
therefore,
these
30
minutes
is,
by
the
initial
order
of
the
court,
to
be
--
to
be
spent
on
what
are
called
question
seven
and
11
which
i've
quoted
at
page
6
of
our
brief.
before
going
into
my
argument,
i'd
like
to
comment
on
mr.
singer's
comment
with
respect
to
the
instructions
to
the
jury
referring
to
the
printed
transcript.
he
read
to
the
court
from
the
top
of
page
748,
a
paragraph
in
which
the
court
said
that
if
you
find
any
witness
has
willfully
testified
falsely,
you
may
disregard
his
entire
testimony.
and
the
impression
i
got
from
the
statement
was
that
this
was
supposed
to
apply
to
what
followed
it.
actually,
if
we
turn
back
to
the
preceding
page,
we
find
that
the
court
had
been
talking
about
the
coconspirators
and
their
testimony.
they
were
government
witnesses.
their
testimony
in
the
case
and
the
fact
that
the
jury
had
to
take
this
--
this
testimony
by
coconspirators
who
had
consistently
lied
that
they
had
to
consider
that
in
the
determination,
so
i
think
it
follows
naturally
from
precedes
rather
than
from
what
follows.
question
seven
in
the
order
--
as
stated
in
the
order
of
the
court
says,
does
it
constitute
due
process
to
subpoena
a
person
to
testify
before
a
grand
jury
in
an
investigation
of
which
he
is
a
primary
target
and
thereby,
permit
an
examination
before
trial
of
a
de
facto
defendant.
now,
on
this
question
as
stated,
the
state
courts
have
split
right
down
in
the
middle,
we
cite
some
of
the
holdings
on
pages
92
and
93
of
--
of
our
brief.
this
court
has
not
passed
upon
the
issue,
although
counselman
against
hitchcock
has
been
cited
by
counsel
as
barring
on
it,
i
think,
it
has
no
barring
on
this
question.
the
lower
federal
courts
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i'm
not
aware
that
it
--
i
haven't
checked
it
since
it
was
referred
to
but
i
am
not
aware
that
it
refers
to
the
grand
jury
situation
at
all
and
it
may,
your
honor,
but
--
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
don't
think
it
has
anything.
i
really
think
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
i
may
do
you
an
injustice.
it
is
cited
in
--
in
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
the
district
--
in
another
case
as
--
as
authority
for
it
--
and
that's
as
far
as
it
goes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
however,
there
has
been
language
in
the
lower
federal
courts
and
the
courts
of
appeals
going
both
ways
on
this
issue
of
whether
or
not
it
is
proper
to
call
a
person
who
is
a
primary
target
before
the
grand
jury.
this
--
the
second
circuit
has
expressed
some
doubt
about
it.
this
--
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
has
expressed
some
doubt,
although,
those
are
not
holdings.
there
is
a
district
court
case
in
new
york
the
lawn
case,
l-a-w-n
case,
in
which
there
was
a
holding
that
it
was
improper.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
it
--
it
is
a
difficult
term.
i
--
i've
taken
the
formulation
of
the
question
as
--
as
it
came
to
me.
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
and
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
[laughs].
that's
right.
i
think
that
the
difficulty
of
the
question
is
--
is
partially
demonstrated
by
the
difficulty
in
--
in
phrasing
it
properly.
on
the
facts
that
we
have
in
this
case,
i
would
say
there
has
been
no
split
of
authority
anywhere
that
on
the
factual
situation,
which
we
have
here,
even
though
these
courts
which
say
that
it
is
improper
to
call
certain
witnesses
before
the
grand
jury
would
not
say
that
it
was
improper
to
call
mr.
halperin
before
the
grand
jury
in
brooklyn.
we
must
remember
that
the
brooklyn
grand
jury
has
been
in
panel
to
examine
into
frauds
in
the
administration
of
the
bureau
of
internal
revenue
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york.
this
appears
from
the
record.
now,
insofar
as
there
was
a
primary
target
for
this
investigation,
it
was
obviously
to
be
found
among
employees
of
the
bureau
of
internal
revenue.halperin
was
a
source
of
information
with
respect
to
such
a
primary
target.
he
was
not
himself,
the
final
object
to
the
investigation.
the
conspirators
themselves
in
talking
before
they
went
before
the
grand
jury
were
in
agreement
that
they
were
in
no
danger
with
respect
to
being
indicted
by
the
brooklyn
grand
jury
because
none
of
the
acts
which
had
been
disclosed
took
place
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
eastern
district
of
new
york.
and
in
fact,
the
--
the
grand
jury
did
not
bring
any
indictment
against
halperin
of
its
new
york
defendants.
i
was,
for
a
long
time,
puzzled
as
to
why
--
why
the
grand
jury
in
eastern
--
deprived
this
matter
with
--
brought
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york.
and
my
guess
is,
and
this
is
a
guess,
but
i
think
it
--
it
may
be
--
may
be
the
reason
mr.
bolich
who
was
later
indicted
by
the
brooklyn
grand
jury
for
--
for
his
own
tax
evasion.
he
was
a
resident
of
--
of
long
island
and
i
think
that
the
--
the
matter
was
brought
in
the
eastern
district
because
actually,
they
were
--
they
were
shooting
for
the
man
in
the
bureau
of
internal
revenue
whose
residence
was
in
the
eastern
district.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
fraud
--
yes,
it
was.
the
--
his
fraud
--
the
fraud
investigation
covered
that
--
that
entire
area.
now
--
well,
this
is
--
with
this
background
as
to
the
purpose
of
the
grand
jury,
i
think,
we've
got
a
very
different
question
as
to
whether
it
was
appropriate
to
call
mr.
halperin
before
it
if
--
that
we
have
one
problem
if
the
jury
is
trying
to
discover
whether
a
particular
man
as
himself
guilty.
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
sure
what
the
answer
to
what
is
but
it's
a
different
problem
when
they
have
decided
that
if
there
is
a
crime,
a
man
has
done
it
and
to
call
him
before
them
for
--
for
investigation
and
where
they
are
investigating
and
trying
to
find
out
whether
a
crime
has
been
committed
and
--
and
who
has
done
it.
and
i
think
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i
don't
--
excuse
me,
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that
i
accepted
the
doctrine.
i'm
not
sure
that
it
is
inappropriate.
maybe
in
the
murder
case,
it
would
be,
i
don't
know.
but
i'm
not
sure
it's
inappropriate
to
call
the
man
before
the
grand
jury
and
give
him
a
chance
to
explain
even
though
he
is
the
primary
defendant,
but
i
say
it
is
a
very
different
question
from
the
question
we
have
here
and
we
have
much
stronger
case
here
than
we
would
have
in
that
case.
the
--
the
function
of
the
grand
jury
is
an
investigative
arm
of
--
of
the
administration
of
justice
is
well
known
to
this
court
and
i'm
not
going
to,
at
this
hour,
go
into
it.
i
will
say
that
as
recently
as
the
costello
case,
this
court
has
explained
the
--
the
importance
of
not
imposing
any
unnecessary
limitations
upon
grand
jury
following
their
investigatory
processes
where
they
will.
i
may
say
that
it's
not
--
it's
not
at
all
unusual
that
a
grand
jury
actually
stands
as
a
protection
for
a
person
who
is
accused
against
the
--
against
the
accusers.
and
it's
--
by
no
means
a
--
a
decision
that
is
only
in
favor
of
the
of
--
in
favor
of
the
government
to
say
that
a
grand
jury
should
have
the
--
the
privilege
of
--
of
carrying
its
inquiry
where
it
willed
and
giving
a
man
who
is
accused
if
they
doesn't
claim
his
privilege,
the
right
of
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
except
that
the
grand
jury
may,
of
course,
and
on
occasion,
does
take
the
matter
into
his
own
hands
and
insist
on
calling
someone
before
it
for
an
explanation.
mr.
john
f.
davis
by
enlarge,
that
is
true
but
i
--
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
function
of
a
grand
jury
--
the
independent
function
of
a
grand
jury
is
an
important
function
and
that
limitation
is
on
--
on
its
activity
should
be
imposed
with
--
with
great
care.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
--
i
think
it's
phrased
in
terms
of
--
of
constitutionality
but
that
depends
upon
whether
the
fifth
amendment
can
be
construed
to
be
a
protection
against
being
asked
the
questions
rather
than
a
protection
against
being
required
to
answer
questions.
and
there
are
cases
where
they
use
that
language.
the
fifth
amendment
doesn't
say
it's
improper
to
ask
things.
it
only
says
that
you've
got
a
right
to
refuse
to
answer
them.
if
--
if
the
fifth
amendment
should
be
carried
further
and
say
that
it's
--
it's
improper
to
ask
them,
then
you
would
have
a
constitutional
question
here.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
that
--
that
is
really
the
--
the
--
i
think
the
crux
of
--
of
the
argument
in
this
case
but
they
are
both
elements
of
it.
i
will
touch
for
just
a
minute
on
the
last
question
in
this
phrase
and
again,
it's
quoted
at
page
6
of
our
brief.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
think
--
i
think
not,
your
honor.
that
gets
to
the
question
of
--
the
question
we
had
this
morning,
which
before
the
court
as
to
whether
it's
proper
to
cross-examine
him
with
respect
to
his
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
our
position
with
respect
to
that
is
that
when
he
takes
the
stand
in
the
trial,
whatever
privileges
he
had
before,
obviously,
no
comment
can
be
made
on
it
if
he
doesn't
take
the
stand.
i
mean
this
court
is
long
held.
you
can
draw
no
inference
and
you
can't
make
any
comment
on
a
failure
of
a
--
of
a
defendant
to
take
a
stand.
but
if
he
takes
the
stand
and
submits
his
explanation
of
these
events
to
the
jury,
then
our
position
is
that
he
waives
his
protection
and
can
be
cross-examined
even
though
he
was
subpoenaed
before
the
grand
jury
in
any
--
in
any
respect.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
would
be
our
position,
although,
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
we
would
say,
you
didn't
have
to
reach
that
point,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
it
was
an
inconsistent
position
when
in
fact
--
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
at
least,
it
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
on
his
direct,
i
--
i
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
may
--
i
may
have
misunderstood
mr.
justice
burton's
question
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
because
these
questions
were
not
questions
that
were
asked
on
direct.
they
were
questions,
which
they
were
asked
before
the
grand
jury.
there
were
specific
questions
which
were
asked
before
the
grand
jury.
and
he
had
testified,
may
i
say,
he
had
testified
on
direct
on
--
on
--
maybe
we
are
just
far
upon
this
as
i
--
as
i
thought.
he
had
testified
on
direct
as
to
his
relations
with
grunewald,
as
to
--
as
to
these
claimants.
and
the
qualm
of
these
questions
is,
did
you
testify
here
today
so
and
so.
and
before
the
grand
jury,
did
you
claim
the
privilege
on
this
question.
i
--
i
think
that
my
first
answer
was
correct.
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
he
--
he
waived
nothing
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
there's
no
--
no
question
i
believe
of
that.
mr.
john
f.
davis
there's
no
--
there's
no
way.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
on
the
direct,
he
was
asked
questions
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
which
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
yes,
that's
right.
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
that
is
right,
with
respect
to
these
specific
questions.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
i
think
that
my
answer
to
justice
burton
was
initially
correct
that
these
were
covered
in
the
direct
examination
in
this
trial.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
but
we
do
not
have
that.
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
inconsistency,
mr.
justice
brennan,
is
in
this,
that
before
the
grand
jury
he
said,
"this
is
something
i
don't
want
to
tell
you
about.
i
may
be
guilty,
i
may
be
innocent
but
i
am
innocent."
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
he
said,
”i
am
innocent.”
but
i
still
--
this
may
tend
to
incriminate
me.
so
what
in
effect
this
means
is,
here
is
something
that
i
do
not
want
to
talk
about
to
disclose
to
you.
then,
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
not
necessarily
because
he
was
guilty
but
because
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
at
that
time,
he
felt
there
was
a
reason
that
he
didn't
want
to
tell
these
things.
now,
he's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
inconsistency
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
there
is
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
is
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
there
is
a
consistent
statement
that
he
was
innocent
but
there
is
an
inconsistent
reply
and
then
in
one
case,
he
is
glad
to
go
ahead.
in
fact,
he
is
called
and
he
puts
himself
on
as
a
witness
to
tell
these
things.
and
in
the
other
case,
he
--
he
is
silent.
he
--
he
refuses
to
do
it.
it's
--
now,
this
may
not
be
because
--
and
there's
no
--
and
this
jury
specifically
instructed
that
he
may
have
claimed
it
on
--
in
innocence
in
the
first
place
but
it's
a
different
treatment.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
it's
for
the
--
it
would
be
for
the
jury
to
determine
whether
the
man's
explanation
as
to
why
he
did
it
in
one
place
and
why
he
did
it
in
the
other
made
a
different
response.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
that's
--
that's
right.
the
trial
judge
would
have
to
determine
that
this
was
in
an
inconsistent
position.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
then,
leave
it
to
the
jury
to
determine
whether
the
inconsistency
is
--
whether
his
explanation
of
his
inconsistent
action
is
credible
or
not.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
in
--
in
raffel
too,
your
honor,
alone
is
--
my
discussion
with
mr.
justice
frankfurter
showed,
this
morning,
showed
that
it
wasn't
particularly
adverted
too.
but
in
raffel
too
you
have
a
situation
where
the
man
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
but
on
cross-examination
in
the
second
case,
he
was
asked
why
he
didn't
take
the
stand.
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
that's
why
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
there's
no
explanation
at
all.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
he
explained
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
wasn't
quite
as
definite
as
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
in
raffel,
but
i
--
he
said
because
his
attorney
had
told
him
he
should
claim
the
privilege
on
that.
mr.
john
f.
davis
this
is
court
--
it
--
it's
quite
clear
that
you
cannot
draw
any
inference
of
guilt
and
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
and
that
is
what
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
but
i
think
that
is
--
may
not
be
pertinent
to
this
situation
because
there,
the
question
really
was
whether
he
was
under
any
compulsion
at
all
to
--
to
say
anything
in
the
first
case.
here,
we
have
no
such
question
and
he
was
clearly
subpoenaed
and
he
had
to
claim
the
privilege.
so
i'm
not
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
--
it
really
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
he
was
really
under
any
--
whether
there
was
any
inconsistency,
whether
he
was
under
any
obligation
when
--
in
the
first
case,
whether
there
was
any
reason
why
he
should
have
denied
it,
unless
you
have
a
feeling
that
the
defendant
in
a
case
who
doesn't
take
the
stand
is
--
is
docking.
but
it
doesn't
seem
as
much
as
though
that
was
an
obligation.
and
therefore,
there
is
less
inconsistency
between
the
first
position
and
the
second
position.
in
that
--
in
this
case,
however,
there's
no
question
that
he
was
subpoenaed.
and
there's
no
question
about
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
whether
he
had
an
obligation
to
respond.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
the
question
--
the
basic
question
there
is
one
of
evidence
whether
or
not
there
was
really
any
inference.
but
what
i
was
really
discussing
with
mr.
justice
brennan
is
whether
these
positions
are
in
affect
inconsistent.
and
i
am
suggesting
to
you
that
it's
--
there
is
more
inconsistency
in
this
case
than
there
would
be
in
raffel
particularly.
if
in
raffel
we
have
to
put
out
of
our
minds
the
--
the
thought
that
if
--
defendant
should
appear
to
defend
himself
or
something,
it
will
be
--
it
will
be
assumed
against
him
because
he
doesn't.
then,
there
is
less
inconsistency.
in
the
first
case,
he
just
didn't
--
there
wasn't
any
obligation
on
him
to
--
to
appear.
he
just
didn't
because
he
didn't
think
of
it,
if
--
if
you
please.
mr.
john
f.
davis
in
the
first
trial.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
yes,
we
can
consider
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
we
can
consider
the
fact
that
--
that
the
jury
would
draw
any
conclusion.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
the
situations
are
fairly
comparable
between
a
defendant
in
a
case
actually
than
someone
who
is
subpoenaed
before
a
grand
jury.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
of
course.
go
on.
mr.
john
f.
davis
please.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
maybe
it
would
be
a
proper
thing
--
i'm
sure
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
it
would
be
a
proper
thing
to
make
that.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i'm
not
sure.
i
don't
think
it's
before
this
--
well,
it
maybe
before
this
court.
i
don't
--
and
this
i
haven't
checked
but
i'm
not
sure
that
there's
any
exception
to
the
charge
on
that
particular
ground.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
i
don't
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
don't
know
what
the
answer
was.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i'm
not
sure
whether
there
is
or
not.
i
have
to
check
the
--
check
the
request
to
know
and
they're
in
--
they're
in
the
record.
i
mean
there's
no
--
there's
no
problem
about
finding
that.
i
--
i
think
that
--
i
don't
know
that
it
makes
the
charge
bad.
i
think
that
it
would
be
a
fairer
charge
if
it
were
included,
whether
we
are
going
to
say
that
it
must
be
charged.i
don't
know.
the
question
of
the
--
of
the
jury,
the
jury
had
to
weigh
it.
they've
heard
the
evidence
as
to
his
reasons
and
how
much
the
judge
has
to
review
the
evidence
that
the
jury
has
heard.
i
don't
--
i
don't
really
know.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
was
before
the
jury,
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
was
very
definitely
put
before
the
jury.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
--
it
may
have
been.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
your
honors'
failure,
i'm
sorry.
does
he
say
failure
to
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
this
specific
one
is.
i
was
wondering
what
that
failure,
the
--
where
--
where
you
stopped.
but
this
is
where
we
will
find
out
whether
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
there
was
and
--
and
i
haven't
--
i
haven't
done
so
at
--
at
the
moment.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
last
--
the
last
point
i'm
going
to
leave
to
the
brief
that
i've
--
i've
--
the
instructions
to
the
jury
were
perfectly
clear
that
they
had
to
find
an
obstruction
of
justice
and
it
advice
to
plead
the
amendment
wasn't
sufficient
and
it
was
left
for
the
jury
on
proper
instructions,
we
submit
to
determine
whether
the
facts
submitted,
they
submitted
the
facts
before
them
justified
the
charge.
so
that
--
i
think
there's
--
there's
very
little
we
done
on
that
point
except
to
read
the
charge
of
the
jury
and
then
determine
whether
there
was
any
evidence
to
sustain
the
--
the
verdict.
