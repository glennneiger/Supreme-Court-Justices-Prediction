j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
davis
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
davis,
does
that
mean
that
the
acts
of
consuming,
we
discussed
yesterday,
were
acts
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy
to
defraud.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
defraud
in
what
way
as
regard
to
those
two
taxpayers,
patullo
modes
and
gotham
beef
or
generally?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
mean
--
and
therefore,
not
really
directly
related
or
necessarily
related
to
the
patullo
modes
or
the
gotham
beef
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
my
difficulty
is,
which
you
referred
to
was
still
at
page
36.
it
seems
to
be
a
submission
of
the
jury
in
relation
specifically
only
to
patullo
modes
and
gotham
beef,
doesn't
it?
the
very
first
or
the
second
sentence
of
--
that
appears
on
what
you
quote
at
page
34.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
is
the
--
summarizing
it
then,
you
think
the
submission
was
in
relation
to
patullo
and
gotham
beef
merely
as
a
loss
to
the
cases
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
--
the
government
offered
no
evidence
that
anything
gone
after
the
assurance
of
no
prosecution
in
those
cases
had
relation
to
any
other
cases?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
davis,
did
i
understand
you
to
answer
the
chief
justice
that
bolich
left
the
government
in
december
1951?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
1951?

justice

1951?
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
1951?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
understand
you
also
to
say
that
on
his
leaving
the
government,
the
conspiracy
necessarily
ended
because
--
without
him?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
--
how
could
anything
they
did
and
i
gather
all
of
these
acts
as
i
looked
at,
that
you
referred
this
to
--
to
382
(a),
all
six
of
them
occurred
after
bolich
left
the
government?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
one
would
that
be?
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
everyone
did.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
i
have
difficulty
following
your
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
theory
that
they
had
any
relation
to
the
overall
conspiracy
which
hinged
this.
i
understood
you
to
say
earlier
upon
bolich
because
without
him,
nothing
could
be
accomplished
in
the
way
of
these
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
you
defined
the
--
the
conspiracy
for
us
as
the
government
sees
it
as
framed
in
the
indictment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
a
conspiracy
to
do
tax
fixing
as
long
as
bolich
was
in
office
and
thus
in
a
position
to
make
it
possible
to
fix.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
let's
see.
let
--
let
us
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
--
let's
stop
there
a
minute.
if
it's
to
protect
the
taxpayers,
was
any
element
of
the
conspiracy
as
a
conspiracy
to
protect
the
taxpayers
charge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
he
do
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
you've
completely
confused
me
now.
i
was
just
following
it
for
a
while
but
if
all
these
hinges
on
bolich,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
contend
that
these
acts
subsequent
to
his
departure
from
the
government
could
reasonably
be
viewed
as
anything
except
acts
to
protect
themselves.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
halperin
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
the
only
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
he
was
the
only
one
to
take
the
stand,
wasn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
davis,
i
know
this
is
germane
to
the
other
point
but
since
he
grounded
his
refusal
before
the
grand
jury
when
he
asserted
the
fifth
on
the
assertion
that
he
was
innocent
and
that
an
innocent
man
as
well
as
the
guilty
one
might
--
in
oppose
with
the
fifth
amendment
rather
than
answering
questions.
well,
i
see
inconsistency
when
he
was
defending
his
innocence
when
he
took
the
stand
at
the
trial,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
didn't
say
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
my
trouble
is
in
--
in
understanding
why
--
as
i
understand
it,
the
government's
theory
justifying
this
cross-examination
at
the
trial
is
that
he
had
taken
an
inconsistent
position.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
earlier
position
cast
an
inference
on
the
credibility
against
the
credibility
of
his
testimony
at
the
trial,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
understand
that
but
the
reason
he
gave
and
what
bothers
me
about
it
is
he
said
that
before
the
grand
jury,
“i
won't
answer
these
questions
because
i'm
innocent.”
now,
he
comes
to
the
trial
and
he
says,
”i'm
answering
these
questions
before
because
i'm
innocent.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
where's
the
inconsistency?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
both
positions
would
consistently
taken
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
part
of
his
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
a
different
treatment
because
the
judge
made
a
finding,
i
assume
he
had
to,
a
law
that
there
was
something
inconsistent
which
in
support
of
an
attack
upon
credibility
permitted
the
cross-examination
of
that
guy.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
besides
for
the
jury
but
the
questions
of
the
propriety
of
cross-examination,
the
admission
of
evidence
before
the
trial
judge
in
the
first
instance
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
my
--
my
underlying
problem
may
be
with
raffel.
i'm
not
sure
it
isn't
but
it
seems
to
me,
at
least,
you
have
an
element
here
that
was
not
present
around.
you
have
more
than
one
element
not
present
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--but
you
have
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
said
he
didn't
take
the
stand.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
in
the
first
instance
in
raffel
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
when
he
didn't
take
the
stand
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap).
here,
he
--
it
opposed
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
plea
on
the
ground
that
he
was
innocent
and
he
didn't
want
to
answer
questions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
