was
it
the
theory
on

justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
the
court
of
appeals
refer
in
the
conviction
on
the
theory
that
the
--
the
conspiracy
was
not
--
did
not
end
with
the
no
prosecution
notice
but
included
a
immunity
from
prosecution.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now
--
but
now,
but
all
i'm
getting
at
is
that
the
theory
you're
discussing
now,
as
i
understand
it,
is
not
the
theory
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
refer
in
the
conviction
but
was
the
theory
in
which
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury.
and
as
i
read
the
briefs,
the
court
of
appeals
sustained
the
conviction
on
a
theory
that
was
not
submitted
to
the
jury.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
agreement
to
conceal
but
who's
benefit,
the
taxpayers'
benefit
or
the
defendants'
benefit?
justice
john
m.
harlan
generally?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that
was
as
submitted
to
the
jury,
and
the
court
of
appeals
had
to
decide
on
that.

thank
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
didn't
the
negotiation
on
that
a
matter
that
terminate
in
1950?
justice
john
m.
harlan
who
doesn't
show
--
you
have
to
show
on
this
theory
of
the
conspiracy
that
there
was
an
overt,
an
act
of
some
kind
formed
within
the
statute
of
limitations.
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
the
judge
differentiate
it
between
concealment
as
to
those
two
purposes
to
this
charge?
justice
john
m.
harlan
concealment
of
what?
what
purpose?
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
the
judge
in
charge
that
you
may
find
from
anyone
of
these
overt
acts,
the
purpose
was
to
conceal,
to
protect
the
conspirators
and
if
you
find
that
that
was
an
object
to
the
conspiracy
you
may
convict.
would
that
stand
up
under
krulewitch?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
would
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
agree.
justice
john
m.
harlan
therefore
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
therefore,
to
escape
krulewitch,
the
concealment
here
must
be
concealment
with
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
taxpayers.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
in
that
connection,
could
i
ask
you,
when
did
the
king
committee
start
operating?
justice
john
m.
harlan
1950
or
1950
or
1951.
justice
john

1950.

now
--

1951.
justice
john

maybe.
(voice

justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
my
point
is
simply
one.
whatever
the
date
was
after
the
king
committee
started
operating,
do
you
think
its
reasonable
inference
that
the
acts
of
concealment
there
could
have
been
--
after
that
time,
could
have
been
directed
to
getting
new
business?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice

--
the
committee
instead
of
covering
up
all
the
tracks.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
my
impression
was
that
the
king
committee
was
in
1950
which
it
seemed
to
me
to
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
thank
you.
justice
john
m.

is
his
grand

the

could

ask
you
a
question?
justice
john

does
this
point
you're
arguing
now
stand
in
the
penalty

--

maybe
i
don't
understand
it

there
was
that

that's
not
my
question.
supposing
we
held

barred
this
prosecution.
does
that
leave

that

several
case
i
suppose,
a
straightforward
case
where
a
man
is
arraigned
in
a
murder
charge
and
his
case
had
entered
the
grand
jury.
there's
no
problem
about
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
accept
the
doctrine
though?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
put
one
question
to
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
is
along
the
line
with
your
colloquy
with
mr.
justice
brennan.
assuming
that
the
question
is
a
permissible
question,
in
other
words,
that
it
could
have
been
--
could
be
asked
and
the
only
question
is
whether
it
has
any
tendency
to
impeach,
what
about
the
failure
of
the
judge
to
his
--
and
to
include
in
his
instructions
to
the
jury,
the
fact
that
before
the
grand
jury,
this
man
have
said
that
the
reason
he
was
not
testifying,
the
reason
he
was
claiming
his
privilege
was
that
counsel
advised
him
and
on
accounts
that
he
personally
regarded
himself
as
innocent?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice

justice
john
m.
harlan
isn't
it
an
essential
thing
to
do?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
an
exclusionary
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
whether
there
wasn't
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
or
whether
there
was
a
request
to
charge
to
cover
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
mean
the
--
the
fact
that
he
had
pleaded,
he
asserted
his
innocence
was
before
the
jury.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
might
have
been
obscured
when
it
came
to
the
charge.
