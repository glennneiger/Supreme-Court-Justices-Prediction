justice
felix
frankfurter
will
these
figures
be
a
factor
in
your
argument
and
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
conditions
that
this
is
not
a
violation
of
the
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
now
referring
to
the
competition
within
continental
america
or
competition
dragging
within
its
ambit
restriction
of
territory
both
here
and
abroad?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
case
ought
to
be,
is
it
not,
i'm
asking,
i
don't
know
i
must
tell
you
is
partly
on
the
interrelation
of
what
happens
here
or
what
happens
abroad
and
the
division
of
territory
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
mere
competition
within
the
united
states
is
being
holophane
and
a,
b,
c,
d
competitors
isn't
--
doesn't
--
doesn't
overlap.
the
problem
is
presented
by
the
record
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
bear
on
the
question
of
dividing
territory?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
all
independent
companies
which
are
also
independent?
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
friendly
relationship
they
are
independent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
in
the
record
anything
that
bears
on
that
statement,
namely,
that
this
agreement
was
entered
into,
in
the
utmost
good
faith
and
if
you
please
with
--
to
reasonably
entertain
legal
views
by
counsel.
the
reason
i
ask
that
question
is
because
for
me
at
least
that
may
bear
somewhat
on
some
aspect
of
the
decree.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
stevens,
does
that
generally
too
often
broad
refer
to
paragraph
8,
9,
and
10
of
the
decree?
does
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
government
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
get
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand
that.
but
first
statement,
“the
government
didn't
contend
with
that.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can
leave
us
alone.
now,
is
that
especially
directed
towards
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
decree
towards
the
duties
enjoined
upon
you
by
the
paragraph
8,
9,
and
10
of
the
decree.
justice
felix
frankfurter
provided
the
remarks
with
the
decree
which
we
have
now
before
us
--
before
the
court
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
it
wasn't
obtained
but
was
there
already
a
submission
by
the
government
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
a
proposed
decree
of
which
this
became
formalized.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
was
to
that
that
this
would
be
marked
or
addressed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
stevens,
you
are
the
best
in
the
--
you
will
do
your
best
how
to
use
your
time
and
speaking
for
myself,
there
are
real
problems
about
the
decree
and
as
i
understand
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
only
can
go
to
2
o'clock
now
if
you
get
around
the
decree.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
,
i
know
but
it
takes
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
this
is
--
your
argument
gets
down
to
the
proposition,
this
is
only
a
little
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
now
assuming
--
assuming
that
you,
when
you're
on
a
decree,
assuming
that
it's
to
be
condemned
under
the
sherman
law,
what
do
you
say
about
the
decree
and
what's
your
objection?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
had
assumed
that
there's
an
actual
or
potential
contradiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
certainly
the
court
of
equity
having
the
defendant
report
and
make
him
do
things
and
transfer
land
outside
of
the
country.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
is
there
--
what
is
there
if
the
only
escape
clause
in
paragraph
11
acquires
those?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
there's
the
sentence
following
your
reasonable
efforts
then
comes
the
clause
nothing
contained
in
this
paragraph
shall
be
construed
in
requiring
the
defendant
to
export
any
said
products
in
violation
of
the
valid
transfer
trademark
of
any
foreign
country.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that
this
decree
doesn't
free
you
from
subjection
to
an
enforceable
contract
of
english
and
french
courts?
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
would
you
say
if
the
district
court
requires
you
to
go
to
an
english
court
and
get
a
declaration
to
its
possibility
of
the
form
of
the
district
contract
and
if
you
were
to
agree
with
the
american
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
it's
asking
you
that
this,
the
selling
point
is
the
filing
of
a
violating
of
an
american
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
to
effectuate
the
violation
you
say
that
everything
can
be
done
but
they
didn't
affect
us
generally.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
don't
think
that's
on
the
necessary
limitation
for
the
court
of
equity
can
make,
it
seems
outside
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
moment
you
don't
collide
potentially
with
the
other
countries.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
stevens
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
stevens,
i've
suggested
an
alternative
that
doesn't
appeal.
and
i
hope
the
government
will
address
itself
here
to
cull
out
the
real
problem
in
this
case
namely,
not
to
make
you
include
things
(inaudible)
to
make
you
go
to
the
english
court
and
say,
“the
american
decree
to
which
we
are
subject
subjects
us
to
the
enforceability
of
the
contract
which
for
them
is
illegal
but
in
this
country
it
may
not
be
illegal.
we
therefore
ask
a
declaration
from
chancery
that
this
--
that
there
is
the
jury
and
that
we
need
to
create
it
then,
the
impossibility
of
restoration,
impossibility
of
performance,
why
shouldn't
we
be
asked
to
go
to
the
english
court
to
get
a
declaration
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
will
leave
your
responsibility
for
a
contract
on
the
english
law
with
the
american
court
where
you
should
disregard
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
you
can
say
that
british
laws
claim
the
right
of
the
means
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'll
have
no
power
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
say
tag.
i'm
saying
you
didn't
play.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
friedman,
in
this
case
were
the
court's
procedure
followed
that
the
abolishment
(inaudible)
couldn't
be
a
fair
amount
of
cases
with
your,
namely,
the
counsel
first
argued
before
the
court
independently,
that's
up
to
divisions
under
the
sherman
law
and
though
they
asked
that
judgments
were
granted
on
that
--
on
that
issue
of
their
illegal
proceedings,
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
appropriate
decree
for
the
prior
findings
of
the
prior
adjudication
on
the
sherman
law.
or
was
it
higgledy-piggledy
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
but
the
plan
and
i
have
only
the
knowledge
(inaudible)
the
trial
was
concluded
long
before
there
was
the
argument
before
the
judge
handled
it
to
the
court
of
which
this
colloquy
took
place.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wasn't
exactly
that
these
show
that
they
knew
the
axe
would
fall
or
the
axe
had
to
fall
on
the
religious
(inaudible)
what
kind
of
religion,
what
kind
--
they
knew
what
it
was
like.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
saying
that
--
i'm
saying
they
were
stopped
from
making
a
decision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
commend
you
for
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
don't
you
agree
paragraph
3
with
the
preceding
paragraph
2
under
this
lawyer
documents
(inaudible)
now,
already
to
have
you
find
it's
fair?
is
that
fair?
is
it
one
of
those
few?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
were
--
they've
been
glad
that
they
thought
of
that
and
nothing
else.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
done.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
the
government's
position,
mr.
friedman,
that
division
of
territory
but
getting
on
foreign,
division
of
the
territory
is
a
violation
per
se
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
fact
that
it's
legal
findings
show
that
did
--
there
--
there
was
estoppel
or
waiver
or
anything
else
to
be
followed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
suppose
that
your
answer
would
be,
that's
irrelevant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
that
be
a
permissible
issue?
would
you
have
to
try
english
law
before
judge
underwood
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
to
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
i
take
judicial
notice
for
the
english
law
for
it
precludes
all
division
of
territories?
or
can
i
take
also
the
contrary
or
do
i
have
to
be
informed
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
since
this
involved
the
activity
in
england,
under
a
system
of
law
which
we
know
and
by
colloquy
under
the
sherman
law,
we
know
that
much.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
isn't
the
burden
on
you
to
establish
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
tell
these
people
to
go
in
there
and
actively
beget
competition.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
court
has
said
on
more
than
one
occasion
about
sherman
or
decrees.
they
ought
not
to
be
indefinitely
framed
with
all
the
threat
of
litigable
contempt
proceedings
following
it,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
before
you
do
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
don't
mean
that,
do
you?
you
don't
meant
that.
that
the
--
one
of
the
motives
or
one
of
the
justifications
for
the
decree
is
to
stimulate
foreign
competition
to
come
in
the
united
states.
that
seems
to
me
a
new
economic
policy
for
an
estoppel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
it
isn't
desirable
but
the
thing
strikes
me
as
not
the
kind
of
a
thing
that
you
could
urge
before
most
courts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
freidman,
under
this
decree,
would
it
be
open
for
the
appellant
to
go
before
the
court
and
say,
in
view
of
the
fact
as
that
in
full
political
parties
that
are
going
in
for
a
high
carat?
we
would
seek
our
satisfactions
by
keeping
the
foreigners
out
and
we
don't
want
to
engage
in
foreign
practice,
in
foreign
affairs.
that
they
--
would
--
would
the
government
cooperate
with
that
condition
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
say,
“no,
he
must
fight
in
foreign
market?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you'd
oppose
it,
wouldn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
but
they
stayed
out
in
part
because
they
are
protected
against
competition.
now,
they
say
that
you're
in
the
judgment,
they
will
get
different
barriers.
they
all
erect
different
barriers
against
competition,
namely,
the
--
they're
not
unfamiliar
and
not
untraditional
american
territories.
we
don't
want
to
go.
there
is
the
labor
government
on
the
horizon
in
england,
and
that
will
--
beget
us
difficulties,
in
various
reasons,
america
is
a
big
enough
economic
playground
for
us
to
cultivate.
that
this
--
this
decree
says
just
the
opposite,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
are
not
for
a
business
concern?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
is
it
the
court's
business
whether
they
should
compete
abroad
or
not
so
long
as
you
throw
off
the
shuttle
against
their
restrictions
to
do
so,
their
self-imposed
restrictions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
does
leave
open
the
fact
that
the
english
court
may
hold
to
say
guilty
of
a
breach
of
contract
and
the
decree
of
judge
underwood
is
no
defense.
that's
nothing
new.
we've
had
this
in
experience
in
the
english
courts,
vis-à-vis
judge
ryan's
decree.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
its
--
doesn't
--
unless
my
lawyer
is
awfully
arrested
here,
that
well
may
be
but
it
doesn't
go
beyond
my
legal
imagination
as
an
english
court
may
hold
that
this
contract
is
valid.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
subjects
the
appellant
to
a
breach
of
--
to
a
suit
for
breach
of
contract.
if
it
behold
it
then
it
may
enforce
it
in
the
way
which
breaching
a
contract
are
enforced.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you
--
if
they
do
what
the
decree
requires
them
--
them
to
do,
namely
to
do
business
in
england,
it
bring
themselves
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
english
courts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
--
but
the
english
courts
may
follow
this
court's
decision,
even
one
of
due
process
clause
in
the
case
like
the
washington
case
as
to
what
constitutes
subservience
to
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
suggest
that
it
doesn't
comfort
very
well
with
the
dignity
of
this
country.
and
to
me,
it
doesn't
seem
desirable
in
international
relation
to
wait
in
the
suit
as
broad
and
an
english
court
says,
“no,
we
don't
have
to
respect
or
to
threaten
--
threaten
(inaudible)
in
an
english
court
would
allow
the
suit
--
suit
for
damages,
and
then
rush
to
judge
underwood's
court
and
say,
(inaudible)
the
english
court
as
you
restrict
it,
so
let's
change
decree.
i
don't
think
that's
a
very
dignified
attitude
for
this
country
or
for
this
--
for
the
judicial
system
of
this
country
to
take.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
prepared,
on
behalf
of
the
government,
to
state
whether
you
will
accept
the
chief
justice's
rephrasing
of
what
this
decree
does?
then
they'd
all
have
to
do
is
to
pull
their
arms
here
and
say,
we're
willing
to
take
any
business
that
is
solicited
from
us?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
on
[laughter]
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
chief
justice
were,
will
you
substitute
those
--
that
rephrasing
for
what
is
in
this
decree?
after
reflection,
you
think
about
it
and
then
tell
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
you
--
would
you
agree
--
would
you
agree
that
i
can
barely
read
the
decree
and
say,
“free
the
--
an
error
of
activity
demanded
from
the
appellant?”
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
--
mr.
friedman,
may
i
trouble
to
ask
you
whether
the
cases
noted
in
the
footnote,
in
your
footnote
32.
will
i
find
the
terms
of
the
decree
and
those
citations
or
the
department
says
we
must
have
to
the
--
if
they're
not
to
be
had,
they're
not
available
in
some
publications.
would
it
be
convenient
for
the
department
to
say
the
--
what
this
means
to
prior
analogous
decree?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
do?
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
i
agree
can
agree.
