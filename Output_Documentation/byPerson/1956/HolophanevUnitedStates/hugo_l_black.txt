justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
the
proposal
in
the
record
of
the
--
of
the
side
that
asked
the
court
to
find
that
their
business
was
illegal?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
say
that
they
proposed
in
the
findings
of
fact
to
the
effect
that
they
had
been
conducting
the
business
in
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that
proposed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
was
the
other
one?
six
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
your
judgment,
you
said.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
section
to
which
you
refer,
they
asked
the
court
to
find.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
find
it
was
illegal?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
this
proposed
to
the
final
judgment
submitted
just
in
the
form
of
the
news
here
without
any
discussion
when
they
presented
it
to
you
in
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
whether
it
was
made
in
the
in
the
form
of
a
--
just
a
matter
--
or
whether
it
was
made
in
a
quick
session,
would
that
show
from
the
brief
that
they
filed,
that
we
have
brief
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
was
filed
with
the
proposed
final
judgment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
in
mind
whether
or
not
that
explained
why
they
were
submitting
this?
as
for
example
that
they
did
not
concede
the
impropriety
or
the
illegality
of
what
they've
been
doing
but
they
were
willing
to
do
--
to
concede
it
to
escape
as
i
understood
counsel
for
the
expense
was
bearing
on
the
litigation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
does
that
appear
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
before
you
do
that,
would
mind
--
i
hate
to
ask
you?
i
would
like
to
follow
up.
do
you
say
that
the
court
found
that
this
was
illegal
that
they
requested.
where
is
that
finding
and
conclusion
and
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what's
the
last
page?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
that
reference
which
you
gave
on
page
695
seemed
--
refers
to
both
contracts.
are
the
same
contracts
that
were
included
in
the
request
of
findings
that
they
were
illegal
at
page
651?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
that
is
true,
where
whether
they
stand
or
they're
valid
under
foreign
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
were
valid
over
there
to
the
extent
that
a
man
who
was
bought
this
felon
could
set
up
as
defense,
he
didn't
have
to
pay
him
and
those
are
contracts
(inaudible)
what
would
be
the
offense?
do
they
have
take
and
jeopardize
their
judgments
on
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
getting
cash?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
they
--
if
they
have
any
business
over
there,
they
could
--
the
government
could
go
after
him
if
it's
illegal.
i
think
you
have
to
meet
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
be
the
same,
wouldn't
it
as
though
you
--
an
injunction
under
those
circumstances
were
mandatory
injunction
for
full-sale
liquor
business
somewhere
to
do
business
in
a
state
where
there's
--
against
a
law
to
sell
liquor
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
supposed
they
were
charged
with
contempt
as
you
suggested
or
was
suggested
to
you.
they
came
in
and
said,
â€œwe
haven't
been
doing
business
(inaudible)
we've
been
advised
that
the
contract
is
illegal
over
there,
almost
an
illegal
over
here
and
subject
ourselves
to
(inaudible)
they
said
as
--
and
that's
the
result
before
we
can
file
with
the
decree
in
trying
to
get
this.
we
file
a
proceeding
in
court
over
there
to
--
until
the
matter
is
adjudicated.
do
you
think
that
any
court
was
doing
things
over
for
subpoena.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you
came
up
it
that
statement
that
they
were
worried
about
it,
they
thought
was
uneven.
they'd
gone
over
there
and
had
filed
a
proceeding
in
order
to
get
the
matter
adjudicated
before
they
attempted
to
do
business.
do
you
think
that
would
be
--
relieve
them
from
punishment
under
the
contempt
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
charge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
be
reasonable?
would
that
--
in
other
words,
would
that
be
reasonable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
mean
to
--
suppose
they
--
suppose
they
had
enacted
what
they
were
citing
for
contempt
before
the
--
this
got
action.
would
you
consider
that
they
were
doing
--
implying
with
the
decree
and
the
reason
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
practical
objections
do
you
have
and
--
and
do
the
record
show
that
you
have
in
a
business
way
to
advertising
if
you
could
actually
get
customers
over
there.
i'm
not
talking
about
your
contract
now,
which
suffice
your
concern
in
this
country
is
illegal.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
practice
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you
could
sell
25%
more.
i
guess
you're
in
business
to
sell
though
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
don't
understand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
glass
would
be
the
same
glass,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
saying
now
is
that
--
as
i
gather,
that
the
practical
business
objection
you
would
have
under
those
circumstances
would
be
that
the
culture
would
be
more
than
the
profits
you
can
get
from
the
business.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
understand
you
to
explain
as
the
banana
case
held
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
forbids
this
country
if
it
wants
to,
to
sell
its
goods
anywhere
it
can?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
--
i
understood
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
understood
that.
