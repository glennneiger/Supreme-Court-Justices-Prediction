mr.
richard
f.
stevens
if
the
court
please.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
discussion
of
counsel
for
the
government
has
ignored
one
vital
fact.
that
is
that
the
record
already
shows
in
this
case
how
this
company
deems
it
reasonable
to
conduct
its
business.
and
it
is
incontrovertible
on
the
record
that
we
deem
it
reasonable,
in
fact
necessary
in
the
conduct
of
our
business
to
sell
through
skill-trained
engineers.
in
other
words,
the
product,
the
physical
product
of
holophane
company
inc.
is
sold
75%
in
conjunction
with
the
engineering
service
which
it
renders.
indeed,
engineering
service,
scientific
lighting
service
is
the
chief
product
of
holophane
company.
therefore,
to
have
on
hand,
even
unmarked
or
newly
marked
glass
to
say
nothing
of
the
shadiness
of
circumvention
implied
in
that
resort.
to
have
on
hand
that
glass
when
the
government
says,
“you
are
not
expected
to
send
somebody
abroad
to
sell
it,”
is
imposing
upon
this
small
company
a
financial
burden
which
it
should
not
be
required
to
assume.
because
in
order
to
have
newly
marked
or
unmarked
glass,
cutting
right
across
its
whole
inventory,
it
must
make
an
entirely
new
set
of
glass
for
expert
--
export
purposes
and
would
be
subjected
to
an
irretrievable
cost
in
doing
that
upon
the
theory
that
we
are
not
expected
to
send
somebody
abroad.
mr.
richard
f.
stevens
i
believe
it
does,
your
honor.
now,
i
--
i
--
mr.
richard
f.
stevens
now
--
mr.
richard
f.
stevens
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
f.
stevens
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
f.
stevens
there
is
no
extensive
discussion
of
that
in
the
record.
i'm
sure,
your
honor.
it
is
in
the
record
that
we
do
so
through
the
engineers,
as
i
have
said.
mr.
richard
f.
stevens
we
--
we
do,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
f.
stevens
and
we
--
we
say
that
--
mr.
richard
f.
stevens
we
say
that
the
district
court
has
no
right
to
order
this
defendant
to
take
any
affirmative
steps
in
england
or
in
france,
or
in
foreign
territories.
we
say
that
it
is
the
responsibility
of
the
government
in
this
case
when
it
asks
for
relief,
which
may
impinge
upon
the
sovereignty
of
another
country
to
have
shown
to
the
district
court
that
there
would
be
no
impingement
in
the
type
of
order
which
it
has
sought
and
presented
to
the
court.
we
say
that
the
specific
requirement
of
advertising,
even
though
a
less
tangible
impingement
upon
the
sovereignty
of
another
nation
is
such
an
impingement
because
it
is
a
thrusting
into
the
territory
of
another
country
of
activities
by
the
sole
defendant
in
an
american
case
of
conduct
contrary
to
the
law
of
those
countries.
and
we
say
that
it
is
a
violation
of
international
law
so
to
do,
and
if
it
were
not
a
violation
of
international
law,
if
it
were
not
in
conflict
with
the
law
of
england
or
the
law
of
france,
the
burden
on
that
matter
rested
with
the
government
and
they
should
have
carried
the
bar.
they
did
not
do
it.
mr.
richard
f.
stevens
starting
de
novo,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
would
be
no
interference.
mr.
richard
f.
stevens
but
starting
with
the
situation
which
we
have
in
this
case
where
there
are
contractual
agreements
binding
upon
limited
in
francaise.
and
obviously
and
inherently
untouched
by
any
decree,
unilaterally
entered
by
judge
underwood.
we
say
that
to
require
us
to
advertise
is
only
a
somewhat
more
subtle
way
of
directing
us
to
conduct
our
business
affirmatively
in
that
territory.
in
other
words,
we
are
no
less
violating
the
contractual
rights
of
--
limited
in
francaise
by
advertising
and
saying
that
barcus
is
willing
from
these
shores.
then
we
are
--
if
we
send
our
men
abroad,
assuming
we
could
find
them
and
train
them
to
sell
the
product
in
the
only
way
we
really
know
how
to
sell
it.
mr.
richard
f.
stevens
the
--
the
--
mr.
richard
f.
stevens
the
--
the
practical
objection,
your
honor,
would
be
that
our
business
experience
is
that
75%
of
this
product
is
sold
in
conjunction
with
the
engineering
services,
which
we
render.
and
that
we
would
be
sitting
in
this
country
when
they
cross
the
board's
inventory,
designed
to
meet
the
requirements
of
this
decree
in
newly
marked
or
unmarked
glass.
and
would
at
most
achieve
a
25%
result
on
the
inventory
which
we
could
have
if
we
in
fact
sold.
mr.
richard
f.
stevens
right.
mr.
richard
f.
stevens
we
--
we
are
--
but
if
--
what
i
am
saying
is
that
in
order
to
sell
that
25%,
we
would
be
subjected
to
the
penalty
of
making
an
entirely
new
inventory
of
glass,
unmarked
or
newly
marked
for
sale
in
the
territories
of
limited
in
francaise.
in
other
words,
the
regular
holophane
inventory
of
glass
with
the
holophane
trademark
on
it
cannot
be
sold
abroad.
mr.
richard
f.
stevens
it
would
be
the
same
glass
but
it
would
have
to
be
cast
in
new
molds
in
order
to
have
it
without
mark
or
bearing
a
new
mark.
mr.
richard
f.
stevens
that's
correct.
there
would
be
a
penalty
inflicted
upon
us.
mr.
richard
f.
stevens
i
know
of
none.
i
know
of
none
and
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
the
suggestion
that
--
that
the
dupont
decree,
the
i.c.i.
dupont
decree
is
comparable,
is
wholly
beside
the
point
because
that
inserted
an
entirely
subjective
test.
that
is
dupont
in
--
in
the
exercise
of
its
business
judgment.
there
is
no
such
provision
here.
mr.
richard
f.
stevens
well,
the
legal
objection,
your
honor,
is
back
on
the
point
of
a
violation
of
international
law.
that
is,
that
such
an
order,
even
with
a
subjective
test,
impinges
upon
the
sovereignty
of
other
nations.
and
that
whether
we
like
or
not,
as
a
matter
of
jurisdiction,
it
just
doesn't
exist.
mr.
richard
f.
stevens
we
have
quoted
authorities
which
we
believe
support
that
point.
mr.
richard
f.
stevens
in
the
--
the
appellants
brief,
your
honor.
those
cases
are
found,
beginning
at
page
36,
i
believe.
we
say
that
the
banana
case
indicated
that
the
sherman
act
applies
within
this
country,
as
recently
as
steele
v.
bulova
watch,
it
was
so
cited.
and
we
say
that
this
country
simply
cannot
impose
its
antitrust
laws
and
its
concept
there
under
upon
foreign
countries.
mr.
richard
f.
stevens
yes,
and
that
is
most
interesting
because
in
the
exercise
of
that,
if
your
honor
will
look
at
the
footnote
17
in
which
imperial
chemicals
and
the
british
nylon
spinners
litigation
is
cited,
is
made
perfectly
clear
that
it
was
when
as
in
this
case,
there
is
no
interference
for
the
sovereignty
of
another
nation.
and
that
case,
your
honor,
was
decided
in
this
court
after
the
supreme
court
of
mexico
had
set
aside
the
registration
of
the
bulova
trademark
by
the
defendant
in
that
case
in
mexico.
and
so,
it
was
approached
with
the
mexican
law
being
in
complete
accord
with
our
law
and
therefore,
no
infringement
upon
its
sovereignty.
mr.
richard
f.
stevens
i
did
not,
sir.
no,
sir.
mr.
richard
f.
stevens
no,
no.
i
--
i
said
that
the
banana
case,
as
i
have
read
it
and
as
was
cited
as
recently
as
steele
v.
bulova
says
that
the
sherman
act
--
mr.
richard
f.
stevens
--
applies
to
acts
within
this
country.
mr.
richard
f.
stevens
that
is
a
territorial
record.
