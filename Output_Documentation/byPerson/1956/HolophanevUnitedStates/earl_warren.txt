states

mr.
stevens.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
who
owns
--
who
owns
the
delaware
corporation
at
the
present
time?
is
that
entirely
independent?
chief
justice
earl
warren
independent.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
of
francaise
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
the
trial
judge
requested
you
to
prepare
your
findings
and
proposed
decree
did
he
put
it
in
that
context
or
--
or
did
you
put
it
in
that
context?
chief
justice
earl
warren
by
--
what
do
you
mean
yourself
the
person?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
when
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
anything
written
by
the
government
or
--
or
stated
by
the
judge
in
the
record
to
the
effect
that
the
--
the
--
one
of
the
findings
prepared
in
the
--
in
the
light
of
some
such
understanding?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
your
point
about
common
ownership,
i
don't
get
that.
that
doesn't
exist
where
it's
applied.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
friedman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
friedman,
may
i
interrupt
just
a
moment
before
we
get
too
far
away
from
what
we've
just
been
discussing.
you
point
out
that
paragraph
4
on
page
--
starts
at
the
bottom
of
page
650
and
going
until
651
there
are
--
there
are
four
contracts
that
are
listed
in
--
in
that
proposal
of
the
appellants.
then
over
on
page
695,
paragraph
5,
the
court
lists
four
other
--
four
contracts
using
the
same
language
that
--
that
is
used
by
the
appellants
but
i
noticed
that
the
second
one
is
dated
1925,
september
15,
1925
between
holophane
glass
company
and
la
societe,
et
cetera,
is
dated
september
15,
1925,
(inaudible)
695,
it's
dated
september
15,
1923.
is
that
--
is
that
(inaudible)?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
it
should
be
--
they
should
be
the
same
date?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
sure
it
was.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
in
the
national
lead
case
and
the
timken
case
this
court
condemned
agreements
for
the
provision
of
markets.
and
i
think
it's
significant
that
in
the
timken
case,
as
in
this
case,
the
agreements
for
the
formation
of
the
french
company
were
entered
into
between
the
british
company
and
the
american
company.
so
that
the
fact
that
you
had
--
had
at
the
time
of
the
execution
of
the
agreements
common
control
and
common
ownership
of
these
company,
does
not
save
them
from
a
concerned
condemnation
of
the
sherman
act.
furthermore,
there's
nothing
in
this
record
to
support
the
suggestion
that
if
it
hadn't
been
for
these
restricted
provisions,
the
american
company
would
never
have
been
created.
some
of
the
participants
in
this
transaction
were
available
as
witnesses
at
the
time
of
trial.
they
were
not
called.
as
far
as
the
record
in
this
case
shows,
we
have
an
agreement
for
the
sale
of
a
portion
of
a
business
followed
by
an
agreement
not
to
compete,
followed
nine
months
later
by
an
agreement
not
to
compete
with
a
third
company
that
wasn't
even
a
party
to
these
negotiations.
so
we
think
that
under
the
--
this
court's
repeated
holdings,
these
agreements
are
per
se
illegal.
and
we
don't
think
that
even
if
they
were
to
be
examined
under
the
rule
of
reason,
this
can
be
justified
as
appellant
seeks
to
do
as
an
ancillary
of
strength.
they're
not
limited
in
time,
they're
of
indefinite
duration,
they're
in
existence
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
they're
not
limited
to
territories
where
the
companies
were
doing
business,
but
broadly
extended
to
the
whole
world.
they
contained
numerous
other
restricted
provisions
going
beyond
merely
staying
out
of
the
market
areas,
and
finally,
the
agreements
included
a
party
which
was
not
concerned
directly
with
the
transaction
that's
fair.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
freidman,
does
this
--
does
this
decree
go
any
farther
than
to
--
to
require
the
appellants
to
give
notice
in
other
countries
through
the
--
in
--
in
the
trade
to
the
effect
that
its
policy
is
changed
and
that
it
is
now
willing
to
do
business
with
them
if
they
want
to
do
business
with
this
company.
and
that
--
and
requiring
them
to
maintain
themselves
in
the
positions
so
far
as
their
product
is
concerned
to
supply
it
if
those
people
wan
it.
now,
does
it
move
farther
than
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
how
much?
that's
what
i'm
asking
you.
[laughter]
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
friedman,
is
there
anything
in
that
decree
either
so
worded
or
by
implication
that
would
require
this
company
to
go
over
to
england
or
any
other
foreign
country
and
submit
itself
to
the
jurisdiction
of
that
country
as
distinguished
from
holding
itself
out
in
this
country
as
being
willing
to
serve
customers
in
any
of
those
countries
who
might
want
to
do
business
with
it
on
--
on
reasonable
terms
here
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he
didn't
put
it
exactly
that
way.
[laughter]
chief
justice
earl
warren
[laughter]
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
friedman,
may
i
ask
this
--
this
question.
what
would
you
think
of
a
combination
of
--
of
the
--
these
two
things.
one,
the
portion
of
the
decree
requiring
these
advertising
features
in
--
in
other
lands,
plus
this
provision
to
make
such
efforts
as
unreasonable
according
to
their
sound
business
judgment.
now,
would
--
would
that
take
care
of
the
little
you
were
talking
about?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
stevenson
--
stevens,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
stevens,
do
you
--
assume
that
the
court
finds
that
your
contracts
were
illegal.
do
you
have
any
--
any
great
objection
to
doing
the
advertising
things
that
this
decree
required,
just
the
advertising?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
on
what
legal
basis
do
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
object
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
--
what
provision
of
international
law
or
what
principle
of
international
law
does
it
violate
for
american
company
to
say,
“we
will
sell
our
product
in
every
part
of
the
world.
we
will
sell
it
--
we're
willing
to
sell
it
in
england,
or
france,
or
germany,
or
wherever
--
wherever
people
--
wherever
there
might
be
customers,
we
our
willing
to
sell
to
them.”
now,
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
you
quoted
such
cases
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
are
they
found?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
did
--
it
did
that
exercise
some
extra
territorial
authority,
did
they
not
in
the
bulova
watch
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
