justice
harold
burton
is
mygatt
--
he
is
not
the
president
now.
justice
harold
burton
and
did
he
have
any
of
this
--
justice
harold
burton
--
first
start?
has
he
evidence
of
the
first
start?(voice
overlap)
--
justice
harold
burton
was
that
holding
stock
at
all?
justice
harold
burton
so,
it
was
a
passing
phase
that
it
wasn't
--
justice
harold
burton
(inaudible)investment
which
is
later
was
given
up.
justice
harold
burton
mr.
stevens,
is
this
an
appropriate
time
to
ask
you
to
give
your
explanation
and
answer
to
the
opening
statement
of
the
government
in
its
summary
of
argument
which
it
said
in
the
court
below
appellant
tried
to
impose
findings
of
conclusions?
justice
harold
burton
in
addition
of
the
markets
among
itself
and
limited
and
francaise
are
illegal
and
therefore
not
in
the
position
to
go
ahead
and
--
justice
harold
burton
mr.
stevens
--
justice
harold
burton
--
at
that
time
and
at
this
time
you
object
to
the
language
of
a
decree
in
the
affirmative
provisions
in
--
in
the
decree.
justice
harold
burton
at
that
time,
you
were
ready
to
yield
on
the
legality
point
are
you
now?
justice
harold
burton
but
if
you
--
if
you
were
wholly
successful
here
or
being
in
this
court,
you
would
then
have
one
of
the
competitors
to
deal
with
united
states?
justice
harold
burton
well
--
now
are
you
speaking
of
those
who
are
here
now?
justice
harold
burton
to
say
one
additional
competitor
or
that
would
be
the
cellophane
--
cellophane
company
of
france
or
--
justice
harold
burton
and
if
you
were
not
successful
then
you
will
--
justice
harold
burton
--
will
open
it
to
the
--
justice
harold
burton
but
if
you
were
successful,
you
wouldn't
have
to
carry
out
other
(inaudible)
would
you
compete
with
them
--
justice
harold
burton
would
it
be
possible
to
establish
that
they
were
reasonable
and
necessary.seemed
so
difficult
to
get
evidence
to
that,
on
whether
to
give
it
a
waive
to
that
finding
or
not.
justice
harold
burton
if
the
burden
is
on
him
to
show
that
they
were
--
justice
harold
burton
--
reasonable
and
necessary.
justice
harold
burton
never
can
tell
what
happens
to
you.
[laughs]
justice
harold
burton
do
you
think
we
have
to
advertise?
justice
harold
burton
you
--
you
tell
him
prominent,
an
advertising
campaign,
if
the
advertising
campaign
is
--
was
anything,
well
then,
they've
got
to
go
ahead
of
me.
justice
harold
burton
then
they've
got
to
find
the
capital
some
place
and
fill
them.
justice
harold
burton
how
can
you
say
that
you
have
allowed
them?
they
shall
within
one
year
by
a
sentence
as
available,
sufficient
quantities
of
unmarked
glass.
justice
harold
burton
well,
at
least
some
money
to
that
respect.
justice
harold
burton
that
way,
they
must
have
good
faith
and
try
to
develop
the
business.
that
way
you
--
justice
harold
burton
before
you
--
what's
--
what
is
this,
a
penalty
on
them
for
their
misconduct?
justice
harold
burton
where
--
what
--
what
competition?
justice
harold
burton
we're
locked
up
to
them,
isn't
it?you
can't
compel
them
to
do
that.
justice
harold
burton
you
mean
by
attacking
them
abroad,
you
stimulate
them
to
come
over
here
and
fight
this
company?
justice
harold
burton
well,
my
--
my
theory
was
directed
at
--
i'd
understood
that
the
purpose
of
a
decree
was
to
do
away
with
the
illegal
actions
that
have
taken
place
in
this
country
and
to
restore
competition
if
--
if
there
was
other
competition
here.
now,
you
were
directing
this
to
the
shift
to
other
countries
that
are
in
the
competition
there.
justice
harold
burton
bit
--
and
i
just
don't
understand
the
purpose
of
that
but
--
justice
harold
burton
were
decrees
suggested
to
the
judge?
justice
harold
burton
did
the
government
suggested
this
decree?
justice
harold
burton
that's
what
they're
doing
now.
justice
harold
burton
is
there
any
doubt
in
the
mind
of
the
government
to
--
you
wouldn't
and
is
a
case
and
there's
power
to
--
to
repel
activities,
actual
activities
in
foreign
--
on
foreign
soil
of
these
companies?
justice
harold
burton
the
equitable
power
is
sufficiently
great
to
--
so
far
as
if
they
go
to
whatever
point
in
the
world
may
be
necessary
--
justice
harold
burton
--
to
carry
its
activities.
justice
harold
burton
but
that's
the
general
equity
power
and
not
power
that
flows
from
the
sherman
act?
justice
harold
burton
do
you
have
any
decision
that
it
proves
a
decree
in
this
form
even
in
this
country?
justice
harold
burton
that
on
page
48,
has
that
been
judicially
approved?
justice
harold
burton
does
the
record
show
that?
justice
harold
burton
(voice
overlap)
possibly
into
just
explaining
to
us
the
--
justice
harold
burton
--
that
manufacturing
glass,
which
now
is
in
molds
and
so
forth
--
justice
harold
burton
you
have
to
have
both.
justice
harold
burton
is
that
--
you
don't
know
where
that
appears
in
the
record,
do
you?
justice
harold
burton
mr.
stevens,
in
answering
the
chief
justice,
you
rested
your
case
on
this
being
active
as
abroad.
what
is
your
position
as
to
this
kind
of
a
decree
to
--
limited
to
this
country?
is
there
any
precedent
for
making
this
kind
of
an
affirmative
decree
here?
justice
harold
burton
well,
what
is
your
legal
objection
to
a
provision
such
as
they
put
in
the
dupont
case,
the
one
on
page
48
of
the
government's
brief,
that's
the
one
providing
that
they
make
such
efforts
that
are
reasonable
according
to
dupont
sound
business
judgment,
not
arrived
at
and
not
influenced
by
unlawful
motives
or
purposes.
