do
your
competitors
give
the
same
service
that
you
do
in
the
lighting
service?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
they
make
the
same
kind
of
glass
that
you
have?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
mr.
friedman,
something
more
than
the
specific
steps
is
contemplated,
is
it
not?
by
reasonable
efforts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what's
the
little
more?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
aren't
--
aren't
the
notifications
that
you
suggest
embraced
within
the
specific
circularization
required?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
i
look
at
c
(2),
inserted
advertisements.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
other
kind
of
advertisings
affect
the
cost?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
should
they
join
what
passes
for
chambers
of
commerce
in
england
and
france?
justice

should
they
join
what
passes
for
chambers
of
commerce
in
england
and
france?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
warehouses?
the
storage
of
the
products
and
those
kinds?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
exhibits,
affairs
and
things
of
that
nature?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
collection
entails
quite
an
expense,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
for
example
--
now,
the
company
were
to
say,
â€œwe
can't
manufacture
in
america
and
ship
to
france
and
england,
our
product
and
tries
that
competitively
was
a
british
and
french
product.
are
they,
nevertheless,
to
go
through
all
this
advertising
and
a
little
more
that
this
suggest
but
to
me
at
least,
you
haven't
defined.
in
that
circumstance,
are
they
required
to
do
all
these?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
it
the
government's
position,
mr.
freidman,
that
even
if
the
appellant
maybe
subjected
successfully
in
england,
or
france,
or
both
to
a
judgment
for
damages
that
that
would
not
be
a
reason.
the
appellant
should
not
do
the
same
as
now
directed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
friedman,
i
hope
--
i
hope
you
didn't
suggest
in
that
last
answer
that
maybe
they
can
do
just
enough
things
not
to
get
caught
by
an
english
court,
and
that's
all
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
don't
you
think
there
that
reasonable
efforts
is
more
an
objective
test,
whereas
dupont's
sound
business
judgment
is
largely
subject?
