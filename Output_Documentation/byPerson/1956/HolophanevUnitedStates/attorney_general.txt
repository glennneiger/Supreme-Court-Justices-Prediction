mr.
attorney
general
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
a
civil
antitrust
case
originating
in
the
southern
district
of
ohio
and
tried
before
his
honor
mell
g.
underwood.
it
comes
before
this
court
upon
appeal
under
the
expediting
act
of
1903
from
an
order
or
judgment
in
decree
entered
by
judge
underwood
february
8,
1954.
a
seasonable
motion
for
new
trial
and
other
relief
after
judgment
was
filed
and
overruled
february
9th,
1955.
thereafter,
proceedings
were
perfected
in
this
court
and
jurisdiction
noted
october
10th,
1955.
the
complaint
charged
a
violation
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
by
a
reason
of
agreements
existing
between
the
appellant,
which
was
the
sole
party
defendant
in
this
litigation
and
two
foreign
corporations.
in
other
words,
in
general
classification,
this
case
is
a
cartel
case.
and
yet
i
might
say
at
the
outset
that
if
there
ever
was
a
case
in
which
that
word
should
not
be
endowed
with
talismanic
qualities
which
preclude
an
examination
under
the
rule
of
reason,
this
case
is
it.
the
appellant,
holophane
company,
inc.
is
a
delaware
corporation
which
has
a
factory
in
newark,
ohio
and
its
general
offices
in
new
york
city.
it
manufactures
prismatic
glassware.
that
is
glassware
which
is
impressed
with
prismatic
contours
either
in
linear
or
circular
form
so
arranged
as
to
conduce
to
the
projection
of
light
patterns.
i
think
on
some
of
the
exhibits
your
honors
will
see
the
slogan,
“we
turn
light
into
illumination.”
it
is
the
function
of
this
prismatic
glassware
to
direct
and
focus
or
diffuse
the
light
which
comes
from
the
source.
the
products
include
what
are
known
as
reflectors
from
which
the
light
obviously
bounces
back,
refractors
through
which
the
light
passes
and
is
bent
into
one
direction
or
another,
and
lenses
which
perform
in
substance
the
same
function
as
is
performed
by
refractors.
generally
speaking,
refractors
are
used
out
of
doors
and
lenses
are
used
indoors.
refractors
are
a
prominent
element
in
the
street
lighting
aspect
of
the
holophane
business
about
which
more
will
be
stated
later.
those
are
the
physical
products
which
holophane
makes.
i
might
add
that
it
not
only
makes
the
glass,
but
to
some
extent
fabricates
lighting
fixtures
which
incorporate
this
prismatic
glassware.
it
also
sells
prismatic
glassware
to
other
fabricators
of
lighting
fixtures
for
incorporation
by
them
in
their
own
structures.
because
of
the
oddity
of
the
name,
it
might
be
worth
just
to
comment
upon
that.
the
name,
holophane
derives
from
two
greek
combining
forms
holo,
meaning
complete,
entire,
or
whole
such
as
in
holograph,
holocaust
and
phane
meaning
to
appear.
and
so
the
term
in
combination
means
wholly
apparent
or
appearing
completely.
and
i
might
say
that
i
was
delighted
to
find
in
the
multivolume
oxford
dictionary
last
week
that
there
actually
is
a
word
holophanerous
meaning
wholly
apparent.
the
facts
in
this
case
as
presented
in
the
record
below
were
developed
by
two
witnesses
who
testified
in
person.
one
called
upon
cross-examination
by
the
government.
the
other
adduced
used
by
the
appellant,
the
defendant
below.
both
were
officers
of
the
appellant.
in
addition,
there
are
stipulations
and
numerous
documents.
the
evidence
shows
in
sum
that
the
holophane
industries
as
one
might
call
them
or
industry
stemmed
from
a
meaning
in
1892
between
an
american,
otis
a.
mygatt,
and
a
french
man
named
blondel.
professor
blondel
had
discovered
the
function
performed
by
the
impression
of
prisms
on
glassware
in
the
focusing
or
diffusion
of
light.
in
1898,
mr.
mygatt,
the
american,
formed
holophane
glass
company
of
new
jersey
and
it
proceeded
to
manufacture
prismatic
glassware.
in
1912,
mr.
mygatt
formed
holophane
limited,
a
british
corporation.
some
time
between
1912
and
1921,
mr.
mygatt
having
become
a
resident
of
france
formed
la
societe
anonyme
francaise
holophane.
he
controlled
not
only
francaise
and
limited,
but
also
the
american
company
which
he
made
a
fully
own
subsidiary
of
limited.
in
1921,
there
was
in
an
agreement
which
appears
in
the
record
i
believe
government's
exhibit
6
between
limited
and
francaise
in
which
limited
granted
to
francaise
the
right
or
exclusive
license
to
sell
in
a
group
of
countries
surrounding
france,
belgium,
switzerland,
italy,
portugal,
and
spain.
by
that
agreement,
francaise
was
not
to
sell
in
british
territory
nor
british
to
sell
in
french
territory.
that
contract
or
agreement
also
provided
that
limited
was
to
have
a
representative
on
francaise
board
of
directors,
with,
of
course,
to
have
the
right
to
inspect
their
books.
accountings
were
regularly
to
have
been
made
and
that
the
contract
was
to
be
construed
as
made
under
english
law
with
the
appointment
of
an
agent
for
service
of
process
in
england.
that
was
the
situation
which
existed
in
1925
when
appellant's
predecessor
came
into
existence.
holophane
glass
company
of
new
jersey
was,
as
i've
indicated
at
that
point
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
limited.
the
evidence
shows
that
in
1925,
the
american
management
wished
to
acquire
the
american
property
for
themselves
that
negotiations
were
conducted
and
a
transaction
consummated.
that
transaction
in
the
record
first
evidences
itself
in
an
agreement
between
limited
and
one
joel
liberman
who
was
counsel
for
the
american
company
and
was
associated
with
mr.
charles
franck,
then
the
american
manager
and
now,
president
of
holophane
company,
incorporated,
the
appellant
herein.
mr.
liberman
has
passed
away.
in
that
agreement,
which
was
dated
june
1st,
1925,
mr.
liberman
acquired
the
opportunity
or
option
to
purchase
the
assets
or
the
stock
of
the
american
company.
it
in
that
agreement,
it
was
to
be
cited
that
there
would
be
reciprocal
recognition
of
trading
areas.
that
agreement
was
assigned
to
a
new
york
corporation
known
as
holophane
illuminating
company
which
was
formed
along
in
september
25
and
which
exercised
the
option
in
the
liberman
agreement
so
that
in
september
of
1925,
holophane
illuminating
company,
the
new
york
corporation
acquired
from
limited
whose
negotiator
was
one
thompson,
the
general
manager
of
limited
acquired
from
it
the
stock
of
holophane
glass
company,
the
new
jersey
corporation.
immediately
there
was
a
change
of
name
of
the
new
york
corporation
to
holophane
glass
company.
a
year
or
so
later,
the
name
was
changed
to
holophane
company,
inc.
in
1929,
the
new
york
corporation
merged
into
a
delaware
corporation
which
is
the
present
appellant.
in
september
--
mr.
attorney
general
it's
entirely
independent
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
attorney
general
it
is.
thank
you.
mr.
attorney
general
and
i
should
state
at
that
point
that
it
is
an
interesting
fact
that
in
the
acquisition
of
the
american
company
by
the
american
interests,
mr.
mygatt
who,
as
i
have
said,
originally
controlled
the
entire
enterprise
owning
francaise,
owning
limited,
and
initially
owning
the
new
jersey
corporation
purchased
all
of
the
preferred
shares
of
the
american
company,
not
common
shares
but
the
preferred
shares
and
became
president
of
the
american
company.
that
is
shown
in
the
record
by
appropriate
exhibits.
at
the
present
time,
holophane
company
is,
as
i've
indicated,
entirely
separate
in
ownership
from
limited
and
francaise.
mr.
attorney
general
mygatt
is
not
the
president.
mr.
attorney
general
mygatt
--
mygatt
is
--
mygatt
is
dead.
mr.
attorney
general
(voice
overlap)
--
the
record
does
not
show
that,
your
honor.
mr.
attorney
general
it
was
not.
the
record
does
not
show
that
without
--
mr.
attorney
general
it
was
passing
phase.
mr.
attorney
general
i
think
thats
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
only
fair
to
infer
from
that
that
in
the
financing
of
the
purchase
of
the
equity
by
the
american
management
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
take
preferred
stock
in
order
that
the
transaction
will
go
forward.
in
september
of
1925
a
so-called
trading
agreement
was
entered
into
between
the
american
company
and
limited.
that
agreement
which
had
been
referred
to
in
mr.
liberman's
original
letter
of
--
to
the
company
and
said
that
a
corresponding
agreement
might
be
offered
with
francaise
included
territorial
restrictions
such
that
the
american
company
was
granted
the
right
to
sell
holophane
products,
all
of
these
companies
selling
under
the
name
of
holophane,
all
of
them
using
the
same
trademark
was
given
the
right
to
sell
holophane
products
in
that
area
of
north
america,
north
of
the
panama
canal
but
exclusive
of
the
west
indies,
in
cuba
and
in
japan,
and
in
the
philippine
islands.
that
agreement
also
provided
that
each
party
would
use
its
best
efforts
to
prevent
exportation
for
its
territory
and
to
the
territory
of
the
other
that
each
party
would
not
carry
on
trade
in
the
territory
of
the
other.
that
each
party
will
neither
apply
for
nor
obtain
patent
or
trademark
protection
in
the
territory
or
countries
of
the
other's
territory
without
the
request
and
--
but
for
the
benefit
of
the
other
party.
that
it
will
communicate
and
assign
developments,
discoveries,
designs,
and
that
it
will
supply
the
other
when
requested
its
products
at
factory
cost
plus
30%.
some
few
months
later,
the
agreement
which
had
been
foreshadowed
in
mr.
liberman's
letter
to
the
company
along
the
same
lines
was
consummated
with
francaise
and
it
was
substantially
the
same
sort
of
agreement.
along
in
1944
after
considerable
correspondence
and
discussion
between
limited
and
francaise
or
rather
limited
and
the
appellant
about
the
south
american
rights
to
sell
holophane
products,
limited
granted
the
right
to
sell
those
products
in
south
america
to
the
american
company,
the
appellant
for
some
$40,300.
at
the
same
time,
the
agreement
of
september
15th,
1925,
the
trading
agreement
as
i've
called
it,
was
renewed
and
it
was
designated
that
it
would
apply
to
the
south
american
territory
acquired
by
the
american
company.
interestingly
enough,
and
in
passing,
both
the
original
agreement
between
mr.
liberman
and
limited
and
the
two
agreements
of
1944
which
i
have
just
mentioned,
contained
clauses
which
designate
that
the
law
of
england
shall
apply
and
that
a
firm
of
solicitors
shall
be
named,
in
fact,
are
named
upon
whom
service
of
process
can
be
made
or
any
matter
drawing
out
of
the
contract.
in
1945,
there
was
a
further
modification
of
the
agreements
which
i
have
referred
to,
to
take
care
of
the
percentages
to
be
paid
between
limited
and
the
american
company
for
certain
additional
work
when
one
called
upon
the
other
to
ship
its
goods
into
the
territory
of
the
other
or
when
specification
work
was
done
by
one
company
for
shipment
into
the
territory
of
the
other.
now,
in
selling
its
prismatic
glassware,
holophane
company,
the
appellant
herein,
in
essence
sells
not
a
physical
product
but
a
service.
the
record
is
explicit
on
that
subject
note
5
on
page
7
of
the
brief
of
the
government
concedes
that
fact.
that
is,
this
is
not
a
product
which
is
sold
in
large
by
letter,
by
telephone
but
rather
it
is
the
result
of
an
engineering
service.
a
study
is
made
by
skilled
lighting
engineers
who
having
perceived
the
problem,
worked
out
a
solution,
make
a
recommendation
and
only
when
it
is
going
through
that
process
is
the
bulk
of
the
business
of
this
company
transacted.
the
evidence
shows
that
75%
of
the
total
volume
of
holophane
business
is
done
in
that
way.
that
there
are
25
lighting
engineers,
sales
engineers
in
its
employ
and
that
that
is
the
normal
course
of
business
for
this
company.
now,
the
size
of
this
company
is
an
extremely
interesting
thing.
as
i
have
said,
i
believe,
in
1925,
it
was
acquired
from
limited
by
the
american
management
group
for
$1,000,000.
yet,
in
1940,
it
had
capital
stock
and
surplus
of
791,000.
the
highest
reached
shown
in
the
record
of
this
case,
your
honors
is
1,859,000
in
1949
and
in
the
year
immediately
prior
to
the
filing
of
this
suit,
1948,
it
had
a
total
of
capital
stock
and
surplus
of
a
1,453,000.
so
it
is
apparent
that
this
is
a
small
company.
not
only
so
because
of
the
capital
stock
and
surplus
figures
i
had
given
but
indeed
because
of
the
sales
volume.
glassware
sales
in
1940
were
740,000.
the
high
point
shown
in
the
record
is
1951,
when
they
ran
2,000,009.
total
sales
in
1940
were
1,111,000.
sales
in
1951,
the
high
point
4,678,000
and
in
the
last
year
prior
to
the
filing
of
this
suit,
some
2,091,000
in
glassware
and
i
think
1,000,425
in
fixtures.
mr.
attorney
general
they
will
indeed.
mr.
attorney
general
they
will
indeed,
your
honor.
now,
on
that
background,
it's
interesting
to
see
what
competition
this
company
has.
prismatic
glassware,
i
have
described,
its
competition,
your
honors,
includes
some
nine
companies
in
this
country
making
products
in
prismatic
glassware
some
of
which
this
company
does
not
make,
many
of
which
it
does.
its
competitors
include
such
concerns
as
corning
glass
works,
one
of
the
largest
of
the
companies
of
its
kind.
mr.
attorney
general
i'm
referring
to
competition
within
this
country.
it
also
has
as
a
competitor
in
this
country,
(inaudible)
which
is
even
larger
than
corning
glass
works.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
mr.
attorney
general
it
is
not
necessarily
conclusive
but
we
submit
that
it
is
the
fact
that's
for
consideration.
mr.
attorney
general
we
think,
your
honor
that
--
that
it
does
in
this
sense.
that
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
the
only
competition
which
has
ever
been
affected
is
competition
between
or
among
the
three
holophane
companies
that
no
competition
outside
or
with
outsiders
has,
in
anyway,
been
affected.
and
that
it
is
solely
a
matter
of
competition
among
those
companies.
now,
as
i
have
said
--
mr.
attorney
general
which
are
independent
companies?
mr.
attorney
general
oh,
yes.
yes,
it
is.
mr.
attorney
general
they
are
independent
companies
(inaudible)
mr.
attorney
general
well,
it's
my
understanding
that
they
are
thoroughly
competitive.
i
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
it's
my
understanding
they
do.
the
record
supports
that.
as
to
these
agreements,
i
should
say
with
the
greatest
candor
that
there
is
no
doubt
but
what
the
appellant
has
lived
up
to
them.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
counsel
at
trial
told
the
court
that
it
was
hardly
necessary
to
examine
the
multitude
of
documents
to
determine
that.
that
the
appellant
thought
the
agreements
were
legal
to
start
with.
still
thought
they
were
legal
and
had
adhered
to
them.
and
so,
the
fact
is
that
we
have
carried
out
our
end
of
the
bargain
which
was
entered
into.
mr.
attorney
general
well
i
think
it
does,
your
honor.
i
think
the
record
does
bear
that
out.
i
think
that
the
record
shows
that,
as
i
have
said,
the
american
management
wished
to
buy
the
american
company
for
itself.
mr.
mygatt
controlled
all
of
the
companies.
his
manager
of
limited,
a
man
named
thompson,
insisted
that
these
provisions
for
an
entry
of
appearance
in
england
be
it
part
of
the
contract.
it
is
our
submission
on
that
subject
that
the
american
holophane
company
could
never
be
--
have
been
born
as
an
independent
unit
but
for
the
acceptance
of
this
territorial
limitations
anymore
than
if
i
undertake
to
borrow
money
from
a
bank
i
can
get
it
without
signing
a
cognovit
note.
that
the
same
type
of
dominant
compulsion
which
inserts
the
waiver
and
entry
of
appearance
in
a
cognovit
note
existed
here
to
compel
that
these
gentlemen
acquiring
the
american
company
agree
to
enter
their
appearance
in
any
matter
stemming
from
these
contracts
which
might
arise
and
enter
it
in
england.
and
not
only
was
that
so,
but
the
compulsion
existed
as
long
as
1944
when
supplemental
agreements
were
made.
mr.
attorney
general
i'll
be
very
happy
to,
your
honor,
(voice
overlap)
--i
was
going
to
state
that
--
mr.
attorney
general
i'll
be
very
happy
to
discuss
that.
when
the
facts
had
been
presented
to
the
court
as
i
have
outlined
--
now,
judge
underwood
asked
that
counsel
submit
suggested
or
proposed
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
and
a
proposed
judgment
and
decree.
that
was
done.
the
judgment
and
decree
and
the
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
submitted
by
the
appellant
were
submitted
in
this
context.
there
had
been
discussion
that
holophane
company
wished
to
terminate
this
litigation.
counsel
for
the
government
had
been
advised,
judge
underwood
had
been
advised.
it
was
apparent
that
at
that
time,
1953,
the
timken
decision
having
been
made
in
1951
being
the
latest,
most
thoroughly
litigated
decree
in
the
field.
that
an
irreducible
minimum
at
which
the
appellant
could
hope
to
terminate
this
litigation
was
the
general
type
of
decree
set
forth
or
approved
in
the
timken
case.
and
so
in
the
proposed
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
which
the
appellant
gave
to
judge
underwood
it
did
have
provisions
which
declared
these
contracts
to
be
illegal
and
that
is
shown
and
discussed
thoroughly,
if
the
court
please,
beginning
on
page
3
of
the
reply
brief
which
we
have
filed.
just
to
set
that
matter
in
context
and
move
on,
my
associate,
mr.
broad,
seated
at
my
left
put
it
very
colorfully.
he
said,
at
page
665
of
the
record,
now
on
page
3
of
my
reply
brief,
"my
version
of
it
is
simply
this.
feeling
as
strongly
as
we
do
that
the
agreements
were
essentially
legal
to
begin
with
and
perhaps
are
still
legal,
we
can't
afford
the
luxury
of
carrying
on
this
expensive
litigation
which
will
put
us
out
of
business
anyway.
so
we
said
to
the
court
and
to
the
government,
very
well
we
will
concede
the
agreements
are
illegal.
we
will
concede
to
the
cancellation.
we
will
concede
never
again,
directly
or
indirectly,
to
be
involved
in
any
such
agreements,
but
please
leave
us
alone."
the
government
isn't
content
with
that.
it
wants
this
little
business
out
of
newark,
ohio
to
become
a
worldwide
business.
we
haven't
the
capital,
we
haven't
the
manpower,
we
haven't
the
know-how
to
spread
ourselves
all
over
the
world.
and
yet,
if
we
are
to
comply
with
the
decree
that
the
government
submitted
to
your
honor,
we
have
one
of
these
two
desperate
choices
either
to
immediately
cease
doing
business
or
to
go
broke
within
a
year
or
two
then
we
say
that
that's
an
imposition
far
beyond
our
means.
mr.
attorney
general
it
refer
--
it
refers,
your
honor
to
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
it
refers
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
your
honor
to
the
entire
proposal
which
we
made,
which
included
the
provisions
under
which
the
court
might
then
find
illegality
in
the
agreements
about
which
we
are
concerned.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
that's
--
mr.
attorney
general
that
--
that
--
mr.
attorney
general
yes.
that
specifically
applies
to
portions
of
the
decree
which
mr.
broad
colorfully
described
as
(inaudible).
that
is
obliging
this
small
american
company
to
go
abroad
and
perform
affirmative
acts
abroad
out
of
the
jurisdiction
of
this
country
and
in
sovereignties
where
it
does
not
have
the
protection
of
the
decree
which
the
district
court
provided
us.
mr.
attorney
general
your
honor,
this
decree
was
subsequently
added
wherein
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
there
was.
mr.
attorney
general
essentially
so.
mr.
attorney
general
essentially
so.
mr.
attorney
general
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
that
is
correct.
mr.
attorney
general
we're
not,
your
honors.
we're
not.
and
we
say
we
have
neither
waived
nor
conceded
because
the
statements
which
were
made
in
the
proposals
which
were
submitted
to
his
honor,
judge
underwood,
were
made
in
the
context
in
which
we
were
saying
if
this
decree
which
we
deemed
to
be
in
the
form
of
the
timken
decree
applied
to
this
case
is
accepted
while
we
don't
like
it.
we
will
take
it
and
abide
by
it.
mr.
attorney
general
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
i
was
not
in
the
trial,
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
that
was
the
context
which
existed
at
the
time
we
were
brought
into
the
litigation.
mr.
attorney
general
i
--
i
mean
our
office.
mr.
attorney
general
and
that
at
that
time,
there
was
discussion
between
the
government
and
holophane
with
the
court
upon
the
basis
upon
which
this
whole
thing
might
be
terminated.
and
it
is
in
that
context
that
these
submissions
were
made.
mr.
attorney
general
there
is
not,
your
honor.
there
is
not.
it's
fair
to
state
that.
i
--
i
think
when
your
honors
examined
however,
the
discussion
of
this
subject
in
our
reply
brief,
each
will
find
that
it
is
irrevocably
documented
that
counsel
for
the
government
understood
that
we
were
undertaking
to
work
out
in
effect
a
final
determination
of
the
decree
of
the
case
at
the
trial
court
level
by
submission
of
what
we
considered
to
be
a
decree
along
the
timken
lines.
mr.
attorney
general
we
would
have
nine
competitors.
mr.
attorney
general
those
who
are
here
now.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
if
we
are
successful
in
this
case
and
the
decree
of
judge
underwood
is
set
aside,
then
the
contracts
which
have
existed
would
still
be
in
existence
and
neither
process
nor
limited
would
export
to
this
country.
mr.
attorney
general
if
we
weren't
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
we
would
--
we
would
open
it
to
some
degree
to
both
limited
and
processed,
correct.
mr.
attorney
general
that
is
correct.
mr.
attorney
general
i'm
--
i'm
--
mr.
attorney
general
i'm
very
interested.
mr.
attorney
general
i'm
sure.
thank
you.
the
decree
which
was
ultimately
entered
by
the
court,
not
only
had
a
provision
section
5
which
canceled
these
contracts
and
i
suggest
again
that
there
was
only
one
defendant
before
the
court,
the
american
company,
that
limited
and
francaise
were
not
before
the
court.
not
only
cancel
those
contracts
but
ordered
this
company
with
$1,500,000
to
$2,000,000
of
networks.
to
perform
affirmative
acts
abroad,
we
were
directed
in
paragraph
11
set
out
in
our
brief,
the
principal
brief
pages
13
and
14,
15
to
do
specific
things
in
paragraph
(c)
and
then
more
broadly
to
use
reasonable
efforts
including
but
not
limited
to
the
use
of
present
or
subsequent
distributors
or
wholly
owned
subsidiaries.
to
promote
the
sale
and
the
distribution
of
said
products
in
foreign
markets
including
the
territories
of
limited
and
francaise.
now
that,
in
substance,
is
the
point
which
we
are
driving
at.
and
on
the
background
of
facts
which
i
have
described,
we
have
two
large
questions
of
law.
we
have
one
which
is
strictly
an
antitrust
question.
and
that
is,
whether
or
not,
the
bare
fact
of
territorial
divisions
and
agreements
existing
between
a
company
such
as
holophane
and
foreign
competitors
makes
that
agreement
per
se
illegal
having
in
mind
the
size
and
market
position
of
holophane,
having
in
mind
the
prior
common
ownership,
and
having
in
mind
the
fact
that
foreign
commerce
is
involved.
i
set
at
the
outset
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
it
does
not
exist
but
that
point,
your
honor,
is
this.
that
if
one
takes
a
rule
of
reason
approach
rather
than
a
flat
per
se
test
here,
there
is
no
way
in
which
holophane
company,
the
appellant,
could
have
come
in
to
existence
but
for
the
acceptance
of
the
territorial
limitations
about
which
we
are
discussing.
and
in
that
context,
in
other
words
coming
from
the
point
of
common
ownership
when
obviously
limited
would
not
sell
and
create
a
competitor,
obviously
limited
was
bound
to
francaise
by
its
own
agreements
and
couldn't
create
a
competitor
for
francaise.
this
company,
if
it
came
into
existence,
had
to
come
into
existence
on
that
basis.
i
have
said
that
this
case
among
cartel
cases
is
a
refreshing
one.
we
don't
here
have
your
honors
the
100%
control
and
domination
of
the
nylon
market
for
example
such
as
existed
in
the
imperial
chemicals
du
pont
case.
we
don't
have
here
the
90%
domination
of
the
titanium
market
which
we
had
in
the
national
lead
case.
we
certainly
don't
have
the
90%
domestic
market
and
the
80%
non-domestic
market
which
existed
in
(inaudible),
nor
do
we
have
the
70%
to
80%
domination
of
domestic
market
in
tapered
roller
bearings,
and
the
25%
domination
of
added
friction
bearings
at
large
which
we
had
in
the
timken
case.
here
we
have
a
concern
which
sells
prismatic
glassware.
not
a
scrap
of
evidence
was
introduced
to
show
the
position
of
that
concern
in
the
prismatic
glassware
industry.
nothing
suggests
that
it
even
remotely
dominates
it.
in
the
complaint,
there
was
an
allegation
that
we
had
some
95%
of
the
market
in
prismatic
glassware
for
the
street
lighting
industry,
but
the
proof
showed
that
the
most
we
have
is
3%.
mr.
attorney
general
this
is
only
a
little
one
among
other
things.
mr.
attorney
general
that
is
the
second
large
area
of
our
discussion.
we
say
first
of
all
that
there
is
not
power
in
a
district
court
to
order
affirmative
acts
abroad.
we
say
your
honors
that
international
law
is
intricately
a
part
of
our
law.
that
one
facet
of
international
law
forbids
the
intrusion
by
decree
of
this
court
or
the
district
court
into
the
affairs
of
other
sovereignties.
mr.
attorney
general
that
it
does.
mr.
attorney
general
there's
no
doubt
about
that
but
--
mr.
attorney
general
i
don't
believe
there
is
an
escape
clause
in
paragraph
11.
i
don't
think
the
word
reasonable
is
an
escape
clause.
i
think
we're
talking
as
a
matter
of
fact
about
power,
your
honor.
mr.
attorney
general
because,
your
honor,
that's
only
part
of
it.
and
the
very
language
your
honor
has
read
indicates
in
part
the
fallacy
of
the
decree
below,
because
the
government
was
most
circumspect
in
saying,
“oh,
no,
we
will
not
intrude
upon
the
patent
or
trademark
law
in
the
territory
of
limited
and
francaise.
all
we
will
do
is
violate
fundamental
contractual
rights
which
exist
there.”
and
we
say
that
there
are
fundamental
inviolable
contractual
rights
recognizable
under
the
law
of
england
which
exists
in
limited
and
we
believe
recognizable
under
the
law
of
france
which
exists
in
francaise.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
that's
in
part.
that's
it.
and
we
say
that
when
we
are
obliged
to
go
abroad,
your
honor,
particularly
in
england
where
we
already
have
an
entry
of
appearance
that
the
district
court
has
asked
this
company
to
expose
itself
in
a
foreign
jurisdiction
to
a
decree
in
a
court
of
equity
or
a
money
judgment
in
a
court
of
law.
mr.
attorney
general
i
would
say
as
a
matter
at
bar
the
district
court
had
no
right
to
do
it.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
correct.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right.
mr.
attorney
general
within
this
country,
yes.
mr.
attorney
general
but
the
court
of
equity
--
mr.
attorney
general
and
i'm
submitting
to
your
honor
that
you
do
collide
with
it
that
the
british
nylon
spinners,
imperial
chemical
litigation,
with
which
i
know
your
honors
are
familiar
demonstrates
that
you
collide
with
it
and
that
this
court
in
its
opinion
in
steelville,
bolivia
and
its
footnote
17
i
believe
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
so
recognizes
that
as
i
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
believe
your
honor
will
know.
mr.
attorney
general
no,
i
think
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
i
think,
your
honor
that
we
should
not
be
asked
to
that.
i
think
that
the
british
law
is
plain
that
this
--
that
these
contracts
are
valid.
mr.
attorney
general
i
respectfully
suggest
to
your
honor
the
british
monopolies
act
does
not
touch
this
subject
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
and
at
this
time
to
--
mr.
attorney
general
well,
if
i
may
proceed,
i've
to
reserve
my
last
one.
mr.
attorney
general
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
first
to
discuss
the
question
of
violation
and
then
the
question
of
relief.
on
the
question
of
violation,
briefly
touching
on
the
question
of
the
concession
which
the
appellant
made
in
the
court
below,
we
just
want
to
point
out
that
this
case
did
not
come
before
the
district
court
in
the
context
of
consent
negotiations.
this
court
came
before
the
district
court
on
a
trial
on
the
merits
and
after
the
trial
had
been
completed,
the
district
judge
directed
both
parties
to
file
proposed
findings
and
proposed
conclusions.
and
the
government
part
had
proposed
findings
and
proposed
conclusions
in
which
it
made
various
suggestions
and
concluded
the
violation
of
the
sherman
act
had
been
shown.
the
appellant
did
not
file
a
conclusion
that
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act
have
not
been
shown
on
the
contrary
after
the
filing
counter
proposals
on
the
facts,
it
then
came
along
and
filed
a
proposed
conclusion
of
law
that
the
agreements
are
illegal
and
further
provided
a
proposed
form
of
decree
in
it
which
is
suggested
that
these
agreements
were
--
should
be
cancelled
and
that
where
they
had
judged
and
adjudicated
to
be
illegal
in
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
mr.
attorney
general
well
it
was,
your
honor,
it
was
higgledy-piggledy
but
it
was
divided
into
two
parts.
there
were
two
arguments
before
the
district
court.
there
was
first
a
trial
on
the
merits
but
before
the
court
decided
the
case,
the
proposed
findings,
and
proposed
judgment
was
submitted.
mr.
attorney
general
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice,
but
the
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
they
--
they
didn't
know
that
the
axe
had
fallen
but
certainty
they
filed
papers
which
suggested
that
they
accepted
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
attorney
general
well,
i
hesitate
to
use
the
word
stopped
but
i
--
i
say
that
--
mr.
attorney
general
but,
we
--
we
think
it's
--
it's
rather
odd
after
they
make
these
concessions
in
the
trial
court
for
them
to
be
now
arguing
before
this
court
as
to
the
legality
of
the
agreement.
and
that
we're
not
questioning
--
to
question
the
decree
because
these
concessions
only
went
to
the
finding
a
violation
of
justice.
mr.
attorney
general
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice.
mr.
attorney
general
mr.
justice,
that
is
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
that
is
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
record
numbers
--
page
648
which
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
is
proposed
conclusion
of
law
number
three.
and
then
at
record
650
to
651,
paragraph
4
of
their
proposed
judgment
beginning
each
of
the
following
agreements
is
hereby
declared
and
they
judged
it
to
be
illegal.
mr.
attorney
general
650
and
651,
paragraph
iv.
mr.
attorney
general
no,
mr.
justice.
that
is
the
defendant
--
mr.
attorney
general
that
is
their
proposed
judgment.
mr.
attorney
general
they
so
--
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
he
did,
mr.
justice.
mr.
attorney
general
i
think
so,
but
i
don't
believe
it
--
that
they
proposed
this
in
terms
of
saying,
“we
will
concede
the
illegality
of
the
agreements
on
condition
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
that
the
court
could
not
impose
a
decree
greater
than
we
proposed.
mr.
attorney
general
it's
not
--
mr.
attorney
general
this
was
submitted
to
the
court
together
with
a
subsequent
brief
and
then
there
were
hearings
three
months
after
these
proposals
had
been
filed
of
which
they
argued
the
question
of
what
form
of
the
judgment
should
be.
mr.
attorney
general
it
is
not
a
part
of
the
record,
mr.
justice.
it
could
apply
--
mr.
attorney
general
i
believe
so,
mr.
justice.
mr.
attorney
general
i
couldn't
state
that,
mr.
justice.
they
did
so
state
at
the
subsequent
hearings
on
the
judgment.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
mr.
justice.
that's
at
660
--
665
it
stated
at
one
point
and
then
began
at
689.
and
turning
now
to
the
question
of
the
legality
of
the
agreements
--
mr.
attorney
general
the
provision
and
the
judgment,
mr.
justice
black,
is
at
695,
paragraph
5.
and
the
conclusion
of
law
is
at
--
conclusion
of
law
number
2
of
record
707-708
and
then
at
record
707,
findings
17,
18,
19,
and
20,
the
court
found
that
the
--
the
agreements
were
illegal.
mr.
attorney
general
707,
mr.
justice.
mr.
attorney
general
i
believe
so,
mr.
justice.
yes,
mr.
justice,
they're
the
same
thing.
now,
coming
to
the
question
of
violation,
that
this
court
repeatedly
and
consistently
has
condemned
the
agreements
for
the
division
of
markets.
it's
condemned
them
in
the
foreign
field.
it's
condemned
them
in
the
domestic
field.
and
the
amount
of
commerce
involved
has
never
been
deemed
significant.
this
is
not
a
section
2
case
where
we
have
to
look
to
the
definition
of
the
relevant
market.
this
is
a
section
1
case
involving
agreements
for
the
division
of
markets.
and
this
court
--
mr.
attorney
general
i
believe
so,
mr.
justice.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
because
that
is
commonly
referred
to
as
the
trading
agreement
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
agreement
of
september
15.
i'm
advised
by
mr.
stevens
that
that
date
was
corrected
later
on.
i
think
it
is
a
typographical
error
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
in
the
record.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
attorney
general
referring
to
the
question
of
violation,
--
mention
one
of
the
brief
matter,
which
is
the
court's
findings
in
this
case
on
the
fact
of
violation
which
is
setout
pages
706
to
707
of
the
record.
and
the
court
there
found
that
the
defendant
had
failed
to
establish
its
contention
that
the
agreements
were
subordinate
to
the
alleged
lawful
--
unlawful
purpose
and
it
found
on
the
contrary,
they
were
designed
to
eliminate
competition
between
the
parties
and
were
neither
measurable
by,
limited
to,
nor
subordinated
to
the
reasonable
necessities
to
the
sale.
so
that
wholly
apart
from
the
question
of
per
se
violation,
the
court
here
found
and
we
think
clearly
so
that
these
agreements
where
unreasonable.
and
i
now
like
to
come
to
--
mr.
attorney
general
i
would
assume
not,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
attorney
general
i
would
assume
not.
mr.
attorney
general
but
--
mr.
attorney
general
well,
i
would
say,
mr.
justice,
that
the
way
was
open
for
the
defendants
to
have
introduced
evidence
to
show
he
--
mr.
attorney
general
to
show
the
facts
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
relating
to
the
execution
of
the
agreements.
and
i
would
now
like
--
mr.
attorney
general
that
is
under
the
per
se
theory,
mr.
justice.
but
i
was
assuming
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
that
they
were
not
per
se.
on
the
--
mr.
attorney
general
coming
to
what
we
think
is
the
major
question
in
this
case,
is
the
propriety
of
the
provision
and
the
decree
directing
the
appellant
to
use
reasonable
efforts
to
promote
the
sale
of
its
--
and
distribution
of
its
products
and
the
territories,
formerly
allocated
to
the
co-conspirators.
we
think
that
on
the
record
in
this
case,
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
there
is
any
real
likelihood
or
conflict
between
judgment
of
the
american
court,
any
possible
judgments
which
may
be
entered
by
a
foreign
court.
mr.
attorney
general
i
would
believe
so,
mr.
justice,
where
the
contention
is
--
mr.
attorney
general
i
would
believe
so
where
the
contention
is
made
that
the
district
court
should
not
direct
these
steps
because
the
agreements
are
still
valid
under
foreign
law
and
there
is
--
his
real
likelihood
of
conflict.
and
of
course,
it's
not
only
british
and
french
law
but
it's
the
law
of
20
or
30
different
countries
all
these
countries
where
they
have
stayed
out,
for
example,
norway,
israel,
lebanon.
all
of
these
place.
mr.
attorney
general
i
would
suggest,
mr.
justice
that
the
third
alternative
is
that
information
is
necessary.
i
don't
think
that
judicial
notice
can
be
taken
in
this
field
of
law,
particularly
in
english
law,
where
there's
change
going
on
all
the
time.
now,
we
--
we're
not
suggesting
before
this
court
that
this
agreements
are
clearly
legal
under
english
law.
what
we
are
suggesting
is,
that
on
the
basis
of
what
is
before
this
court,
it
cannot
be
said
that
the
agreements
are
--
i'm
sorry,
i
misspoke
myself.
we're
not
saying
that
the
agreements
are
clearly
legal
under
english
law.
all
that
we're
saying
is
it
cannot
be
assumed
that
the
agreements
are
clearly
illegal.
mr.
attorney
general
yes.
mr.
attorney
general
i
think,
mr.
justice,
because
where
the
--
mr.
attorney
general
well,
if
i
may
address
myself
to
that
as
a
threshold
question.
this
decree
merely
directs
them
to
use
reasonable
efforts.
now,
we
disagree
with
them
that
reasonable
efforts
means
they
have
to
send
salesmen
necessarily
into
england,
that
they
have
to
do
all
of
these
things.
we
think
there
are
many
things
which
they
can
do
without
physically
setting
foot
inside
of
england.
for
example,
the
question
of
advertising,
the
question
of
sending
notice
to
the
british
government,
or
the
french
government
that
these
products
are
now
available,
advising
engineering,
professional
societies
in
that
area.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
that
is
specifically
directed
by
--
mr.
attorney
general
well,
the
decree
assumes
that
if
they
advertise
and
they
get
orders
from
these
advertisements,
they're
going
to
fill
them
and
send
them
abroad.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
we
--
we
assume
that
there's
no
contention
made
that
they
have
to
expand.
they
don't
contend
that
they
have
to
expand
their
production
in
order
to
fill
these
orders
from
abroad.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
this
may
contemplate
some
expansion.
this
may
contemplate
the
having
availability
--
available
some
unmarked
glasses
and
glass
with
another
trade
mark,
but
there's
nothing
here
to
show
that
they'd
have
to,
for
example,
build
a
new
plant
or
something
like
that.
mr.
attorney
general
i
--
i
would
assume
that.
yes,
i
think
that
inevitably,
when
you
attempt
to
develop
business
in
a
new
market,
it's
going
to
entail
some
cost.
mr.
attorney
general
that
is
correct.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
i
assume
that
--
we
assume
that
reasonable
efforts
includes
a
specific
steps,
plus
a
little
more.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
such
things
as
i
have
suggested
which
are
not
specifically
spelled
out.
such
as
--
what
--
whatever
steps
they
might
feel
reasonably
would
be
required
to
try
to
develop
the
sales
in
this
product,
such
as
notifying
possible
purchases
in
the
foreign
country,
notifying
the
government
--
mr.
attorney
general
we
are
suggesting
that
over
and
above,
these
are
the
specific
circularizations,
only
to
people
who
have
requested
an
order
who
--
whose
made
an
inquiry
from
the
appellant,
and
the
appellant
has
turned
it
down.
mr.
attorney
general
in
trade
journal.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
such
as
direct
mail
solicitation
of
other
people,
advising
various
trade
societies
and
governmental
groups
in
these
territories.
mr.
attorney
general
pardon
me,
sir,
i
didn't
hear
it.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
they
--
they
think
this
is
necessary
and
reasonable
to
develop
their
business,
the
decree
doesn't
direct
them
to
do
that,
at
least
a
measure
of
flexibility
to
them.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
there
again,
there's
nothing
to
show
that's
it's
necessary
for
them
to
warehouse
the
products.
we
assume
that
they
can
fill
the
orders
from
this
country.
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
that
it's
necessary
for
them
to
warehouse
products
in
those
countries.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
if
they
fail
that
it
--
it's
appropriate
for
them
to
participate
in
these
things,
they
--
certainly,
i
don't
think
there
--
they
would
be
held
in
contempt
for
not
joining
--
participating
in
the
trade
fair
in
london,
say.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
i
think
it
--
it
entail
something
of
an
expense
but
i
think
that
there
are
provisions
in
antitrust
decrees
which
entail
considerable
expense.
and
at
the
possible
expense
involved
in
complying
with
this
decree
has
to
be
weighed
on
the
other
hand
with
the
benefits
which
we
think
will
result
to
the
commerce
of
the
united
states
from
this
decree.
i'd
like
to
advert
briefly
to
those
benefits.
mr.
attorney
general
no,
mr.
justice.
this
is
designed
to
help
pry
oven
--
open
the
avenues
of
competition
which
have
been
closed
but
--
mr.
attorney
general
the
fact
that
the
foreign
companies
have
never
come
into
this
country
--
mr.
attorney
general
no,
we
can't
but
we
help
to
stimulate
them.
mr.
attorney
general
we
--
we
hope.
the
hope
is
that
the
--
the
theory
of
this
decree
is
--
mr.
attorney
general
no,
mr.
justice.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
--
mr.
attorney
general
we
--
we
stop
--
mr.
attorney
general
well,
the
--
mr.
attorney
general
the
--
the
restraints
which
we
had
in
this
case,
our
agreements
under
which
the
american
company
refuses
to
ship
abroad
and
concomitantly,
the
foreign
companies
refuse
to
ship
into
this
country.
now,
the
theory
of
the
judge
was
that
if
you
merely
canceled
the
agreements,
merely
said,
“these
illegal
agreements
are
canceled.”
in
view
of
this
well-settled
pattern
that
these
companies
had,
this
would
not
be
enough
to
open
up
competition.
they
would
be
inclined
to
say
the
agreements
have
been
canceled,
we'll
just
go
on
about
our
way
without
the
agreements.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
attorney
general
the
government
suggested
this
decree
with
one
modification.
the
government's
proposed
decree
did
not
have
the
fist
sentence
in
paragraph
(11)
a,
the
use
of
reasonable
efforts.
the
judgment
merely
suggested
the
specific
provisions
set
forth
in
paragraph
c
of
(11).
mr.
attorney
general
no.
mr.
attorney
general
no,
when
we
--
well,
we
certainly
wouldn't
cooperate
in
that
position
but
i
think
--
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right.
because
i
think
the
question
of
whether
they
have
to
go
out
in
the
abstract
and
do
business
abroad
is
not
presented
by
this
case.
the
question
in
this
case
is
what
they
have
to
do
when
they
have
stayed
out
of
the
foreign
markets
as
a
result
--
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right
because
we
think
those
are
not
proper
considerations.
mr.
attorney
general
their
proper
considerations
in
determining
where
it
wants
to
do
business,
certainly.
but
we
don't
have
their
proper
considerations
for
the
court
to
take
into
account
in
determining
whether
it
requires
a
company
to
take
reasonable
steps
to
compete
abroad.
mr.
attorney
general
because,
mr.
justice,
the
court
felt
that
the
self-imposed
restrictions,
merely
removing
those,
would
not
be
enough
to
stimulate
the
american
foreign
commerce
which
has
been
a
restrained
by
this
conspiracy.
mr.
attorney
general
i
would
say
that
it
goes
a
little
bit
further
than
that.
mr.
attorney
general
i
would
say
it's
required
them
to
give
notice
and
also
to
make
efforts
to
try
to
develop
that
trade
to
stimulate
it.
now,
the
question
as
to
how
far
they
have
to
go
to
stimulate
whether
particular
things
might
be
done.
that,
it
seems
to
us,
comes
within
the
broad
area
of
business
judgment.
mr.
attorney
general
i
don't
think
so,
and
i
would
suggest,
mr.
justice,
in
most
circumstances,
the
appropriate
procedure
for
them
would
be
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
either
ask
for
modification
or
for
a
construction
of
the
decree,
that
under
the
showing
which
they
make,
taking
reasonable
efforts
did
not
require
those
steps.
mr.
attorney
general
no,
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice,
because
their
contentions
are
predicated
on
no
factual
basis.
the
--
they
just
make
these
statements.
they
say
that
the
agreements,
for
example,
are
clearly
valid
under
foreign
law.
that
is
not
established.
they
suggest
--
mr.
attorney
general
if
they're
valid
under
foreign
law,
that
still
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
a
foreign
court
would
enter
a
judgment
which
would
enjoin
them
from
reaching
the
agreements
there.
and
the
first
--
mr.
attorney
general
i
would
think,
mr.
justice,
they
could
protect
themselves
against
that.
mr.
attorney
general
by
getting
cash,
by
selling
the
goods
fob
new
york
or
wherever
they
ship
from.
mr.
attorney
general
well
--
mr.
attorney
general
we
--
we
don't
construe
this
judgment
as
requiring
him
to
do
anything
which
is
illegal
under
foreign
law
in
the
sense
that
a
foreign
law
provides
a
penalty
for
it.
if
there's
any
foreign
ordinance
or
decree,
which
prohibits
it,
or
if
a
foreign
court
enjoins
them
from
--
before
carrying
on
business
in
this
countries.
we
think
the
direction
to
use
reasonable
efforts
does
not
--
obviously,
does
not
require
that
they
violate
the
judgment
of
a
foreign
court.
mr.
attorney
general
that
the
court
may
still
hold,
we
don't
know.
mr.
attorney
general
court
--
the
courts
may
state
that
the
type
of
disruption
with
contractual
rights
here
involved
is
significantly
different
from
that
in
the
nylon
spinners
case.
in
the
nylon
spinners
case,
what
they
did
was
they
directed
them
to
reassign
patents
that
had
been
assigned.
here,
the
only
thing
involved
is
a
contractual,
an
executory
contract
not
to
do
business
there.
mr.
attorney
general
it
may
well
but
the
mere
fact
that
the
english
court
holds
that
this
contract
is
valid
--
mr.
attorney
general
no.
we
think
that
the
--
the
judgment
does
not
require
him
to
take
steps
which
create
a
real
likelihood
of
being
subjected
to
judgment
for
pecuniary
damages
but
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
that
is,
we
think
extremely
conjectural.
mr.
stevens
had
spoken
about
this
entry
of
appearance
was
a
--
which
is
available.
the
entry
of
appearance
however,
was
not
made
in
the
basic
contract
which
was
found
illegal
in
this
suit,
the
basic
1925
sharing
agreement.
the
entry
of
appearance
related
only
to
the
agreement
to
sell
the
business
and
subsequent
agreements
modifying
the
basic
agreement.
and
i
would
assume
that
under
these
circumstances,
the
argument
at
least
could
be
pressed
by
appellant
before
the
english
court
that
there
is
no
entry
of
appearance.
mr.
attorney
general
if,
mr.
justice,
the
question
of
how
they
do
business
may
well
determine
whether
they
have
to
go
into
the
english
court.
they
may
find
that
they
can
effectively
sell
products
in
england
without
ever
setting
foot
in
england.
mr.
attorney
general
but
--
once
again,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
--
mr.
attorney
general
no,
i
wasn't
suggesting
in
that
sense,
certainly,
mr.
justice.
i
was
suggesting
that
before
they
subjected
to
any
real
likelihood
of
being
held
liable
here,
we
have
to
have
--
we
think
there
has
to
be
something
more
than
a
mere
statement
that
they
are
threatened
with
suit
by
one
of
these
companies,
a
threat
made
at
a
time
when
the
matter
was
pending
before
the
district
court
and
which
obviously
was
designed
in
attempt
to
influence
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
they
may
--
we
don't
know
the
british
company
may
well
conclude
that
would
see
advertisements
beginning
to
appear
in
british
territory.
it
adheres
that
the
american
company
is
attempting
--
getting
business
in
england
that
they're
better
off
to
forget
this
territorial
allocation.
they
may
decide
--
we've
had
enough
of
this
cartel.
we
can
undersell
the
american
company,
the
american
--
let
the
american
company
come
in
here.
we'll
go
into
america
and
we'll
take
over
most
of
their
market.
that
--
mr.
attorney
general
well,
in
the
--
mr.
justice
--
chief
justice,
in
the
first
instance
at
least,
we
think
that
they
can
comply
with
it's
judgment
by
staying
in
this
country.
now,
if
it
turns
out
that
they
merely
hold
themselves
out.
they
put
ads
in
and
they
wait
here
and
they
get
no
business,
i
suppose
the
question
might
well
then
arise
whether
they
have
complied
with
the
provisions
of
the
decree.
i
would
suggest
at
that
point,
they
may
well
go
back
to
judge
underwood
and
say,
“this
is
what
we've
done,
nothing
has
happened,
isn't
this
reasonable
effort?”
and
if
the
judge
agrees
in
the
point
if
he
says
no,
then,
it
seems
to
me
that
is
the
time
--
that
point
to
challenge
any
of
the
further
step,
which
the
decree
contemplates.
mr.
attorney
general
but
that's
the
word
--
mr.
attorney
general
i'd
--
i'd
like
to
reflect
upon
it
and
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
and
--
and
then
with
--
with
your
kind
permission,
mr.
justice,
i
would
like
if
possible
to
consult
with
my
superiors
as
to
that
but
i
don't
i
think
i'm
quite
free
to
make
this
concession.
i
think
that
--
mr.
attorney
general
i
think
the
suggestion
does
go
back
a
little
from
what
the
decree
suggest
and
i
think
in
all
candid,
i
should
say
that
i
don't
think
i
can
read
the
decree
in
its
present
languages
contemplating
only
that.
on
the
other
hand,
we
think
that
it
is
necessary
that
--
and
we
--
we
believe
it's
very
important
that
the
--
a
decree
should
be
entered
which
goes
beyond
merely
canceling
the
agreements.
and
if
this
court
naturally
feels
that
the
decree
is
presently
--
and
it
goes
too
far,
we
certainly
would
have
no
objection
for
a
modification
along
those
--
mr.
attorney
general
i
would
say
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
attorney
general
we
--
we
don't
think
there's
any
--
any
question
of
power.
we
think
the
real
issue
here
is
whether
the
court
has
gone
beyond
its
proper
discretion.
court
of
equity
--
mr.
attorney
general
we
--
we
think
so
that
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
that
a
court
of
equity
has
the
power
to
direct
the
defendant
to
take
steps
beyond
its
borders
and
--
mr.
attorney
general
that
is
correct.
we
think
that
sherman
act
court,
as
a
court
of
equity
has
that
power,
plus
the
power
in
the
court
of
--
in
the
sherman
act
to
take
steps
to
restrain
and
prevent.
mr.
attorney
general
in
a
substantially
similar
provision,
mr.
justice
burton,
was
contained
in
the
decree
in
the
i.c.i.
case.
not
the
aspect
of
it
that
was
litigated
in
the
british
court
but
another
provision,
which
we
have
set
out
in
page
48
of
our
brief.
and
in
addition
to
that,
we
have
set
out
in
a
footnote
that
there's
been
several
recent
consent
decrees
in
which
provision
is
directing
the
--
the
parties
--
mr.
attorney
general
that
has
not
been
reported
but
that
is
the
paragraph
as
entered
in
the
i.c.i.
case.
mr.
attorney
general
we
will
be
happy
to,
mr.
justice.
these
particular
citations
do
contain
the
text
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
of
the
decrees
in
those
cases.
mr.
attorney
general
sir?
mr.
attorney
general
well,
the
only
difficulty
i
have
would
be
sound
business
judgment
concept,
is
the
difficulty
of
determining
what
is
sound
business
judgment.
in
other
words,
if
this
company
should
conclude
that
in
its
sound
business
judgment,
it
is
not
warranted
in
doing
business
in
any
of
these
countries,
under
the
terms
of
the
dupont
decree,
i
assume
they're
not
required
to
go
abroad.
now,
sound
business
judgment,
if
it
were
in
the
sense
that
--
i
--
i
think
to
some
extent
at
least,
that
is
covered
by
the
reasonable
efforts
provision.
if
it's
something
that
just
wouldn't
make
much
sense
from
a
business
point
of
view
at
all.
for
example,
to
sell
in
a
territory
just
not
economically
feasible
because
of
the
distance
and
because
of
the
transportation
difficulties,
i
think
there
is
sound
business
judgment
and
reasonable
efforts
to
coalesce.
mr.
attorney
general
i
think
so
but
i
think
that
again,
the
two
do
coalesce
because
in
determining
what
are
reasonable
efforts,
you
have
to
look
to
what
is
a
sound
business
judgment.
the
thing
--
to
be
quite
frank
that
i'm
afraid
of
under
this
provision,
this
would
leave
the
way
open
for
these
people
to
reach
the
same
result
as
they
had
in
the
past
without
the
arrange
--
benefit
of
this
cartel
arrangement.
they
would
--
could
well
determine
as
a
matter
of
a
sound
business
judgment
but
they
didn't
want
to
go
into
these
countries.
now,
i
think
that
--
mr.
attorney
general
i
believe
so,
mr.
justice.
mr.
attorney
general
i
would
think
it
would,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
might
mention
--
mr.
attorney
general
that
is
correct.
with
this
further
suggestion
that
if
in
the
intervening
period
they
determined
that
it
just
isn't
feasible
for
them
and
they
just
can't
carry
this
thing
out,
they
can
then
go
before
the
district
court.
i
think
it's
--
it's
rather
significant
here
that
this
company
is
--
indicates
that
it
has
no
wish
to
try
to
sell
abroad
and
yet
quite
significantly,
it
felt
it
was
worth
$40,000
to
it
to
purchase
the
rights
to
do
business
in
south
america.
so
that
when
they
say
they
have
no
desire
to
go
abroad
but
we
think
it's
pretty
clear
and
it's
also
shown
by
the
way
in
which
they
keep
referring
orders
to
these
foreign
companies
unless
the
foreign
company
agrees.
in
situations
where
they
get
the
consent
of
the
foreign
company,
they
have
no
hesitancy
in
shipping
an
order
into
the
territory
of
that
company.
so
that,
we
think
it's
pretty
clear
from
this
record
that
this
company
is
staying
out
of
these
territories
not
because
as
a
matter
of
business
judgment.
it
doesn't
think
it
wants
to
do
business
in
these
areas
but
rather
because
these
agreements
are
bound
to
it
to
stay
out
and
in
turn,
the
other
companies
are
giving
it
absence
of
competition
in
the
domestic
market.
now,
we
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
a
combination
of
the
giving
them
some
measure
of
discretion
in
the
exercise
of
business
judgment
where
it's
appropriate
that
they
should
not
take
certain
steps
in
combination
with
these
specific
steps,
would
be
a
admirable
solution
to
this
--
what
seems
to
be
this
dilemma
or
one
hand,
a
need
for
something
to
be
done
and
on
the
other
hand,
the
problem
of
--
we
--
we
don't
want
to
put
them
in
the
position
where
they
feel
they've
got
a
club
hanging
over
them
that
they
--
we
--
we're
not
suggesting
they
had
to
go
abroad
and
get
themselves
subjected
to
serious
damage
suits.
that
they
have
to
--
to
do
something
which
is
basically
more
than
is
required
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
to
dissipate
these
restraints
on
trade.
mr.
attorney
general
in
england,
you
mean?
mr.
attorney
general
well,
well,
i
would
think
--
mr.
attorney
general
in
the
--
in
the
--
mr.
attorney
general
mr.
justice,
the
--
mr.
attorney
general
i
would
think
so.
that
if
--
if
they
went
to,
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
had
suggested
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
earlier.
if
they
went
to
an
english
court
and
sought
a
--
some
sort
of
declaratory
relief,
i
don't
know
whether
the
court
would
give
it
to
them.
but
if
they
did
and
the
court
said
no,
we
still
would
consider
this
agreement
valid
under
english
law.
you
attempt
to
do
business
in
this
country,
you're
going
to
get
in
trouble.
i
think
that
would
constitute
a
showing
of,
having
taken
a
reason
--
mr.
attorney
general
i
would
--
i
would
think
they
were
using
reasonable
efforts
if
they
attempted
in
good
faith
to
try
to
ascertain
or
just
what
the
consequences
would
be
of
the
various
competitive
steps.
and
i
want
to
emphasize
once
again
that
there's
nothing
in
this
decree
which
directs
the
appellant
specifically
to
go
abroad
in
the
sense
of
sending
personnel
abroad,
of
sending
goods
abroad,
of
setting
up
warehouses,
of
taking
any
steps
which
may
actually
subject
them
to
any
damages.
that
at
least
as
far
as
it
appears
in
the
first
instance,
we
think
all
that
is
required
under
reasonable
efforts
is
to
stay
right
within
the
boarders
of
the
united
states
and
try
to
reach
out
and
see
to
what
extent
they
can
stimulate
this
foreign
commerce,
and
then
to
go
forward
from
that
point.
thank
you.
