justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
doub,
may
i
ask
you?
do
i
understand
that
the
government
is
drawing
a
distinction
as
regards
the
allegations
between
nonfeasance
and
affirmative
in
this
issue?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
does
that
--
does
that
apply
as
fully
to
subdivision
(n)
at
page
29
failing
to
carryout
and
put
into
effect
the
fire
suppression
plan?
i
gather
your
adversary's
description
of
that
plan
is
active.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
they
have
--
in
the
paragraph
18,
this
makes
a
reference
to
paragraph
18
which
purports
to
give
us
a
description
of
the
plan.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
any
event
if
there
is
a
plan
and
that's
what
is
embraced
in
this
allegation
of
the
kind
that
was
described
for
us
which
i
gather
is
the
fact
they
--
the
cooperative
effort
among
all
owners
was
the
government
or
otherwise.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
he
doesn't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
he
doesn't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
not
his
allegation.
his
--
the
allegation
is
failing
to
carryout
and
put
into
effect
the
fire
suppression
plan.
now
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
i
--
i
what
i
put
--
i've
been
wondering
is
whether
assuming
that
your
characterization
of
the
other
allegations
as
merely
allegations
of
supposed
nonfeasance
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
omissions
to
do
something
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
accurate.
would
it
be
as
accurate
of
the
allegation
of
failure
to
put
to
the
effect
the
fire
suppression
plan,
assuming
now
that
the
details
of
it
is
that
mr.
marion
described
them
for
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
they
not
be
entitled
to
an
opportunity
to
prove
of
the
extent
under
that
allegation
to
which
that
plan
had
not
been
carried
out?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to
is
would
--
could
the
immunity
apply,
perhaps
you're
arguing
the
answer
quickly,
yes
it
would.
if
in
fact,
there
existed
that
kind
of
plan
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
government
backed
down
or
failed
to
go
through
with
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
it
had
gone
into
such
a
plan
with
knowledge
necessarily
that
those
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
who
joined
with
it
would
be
relying
upon
the
government
to
do
the
things
that
the
government
undertook
thereby
to
do.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
you
might
exclude
one.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
principle
of
your
knowledge
was
--
have
ever
been
applied
to
this
kind
of
arrangement,
this
fire
suppression
command
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
apart
from
that.
i
mean
this
kind
of
arrangement
that
under
which
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
for
any
other
purpose
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
this
45?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
where
--
where
were
you
reading
from?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
all
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
mr.
doub,
i
noticed
in
this
agreement,
you
refer
this
to
13
which
has
the
provision
that
the
united
states
shall
not
be
liable
for
any
damage
incident
to
cooperation
hereunder.
but
what
of
section
9,
that
nothing
shall
be
understood
to
impair
the
right,
the
united
states
--
what
state
of
washington
or
any
person
or
corporation
to
recover
the
cause
of
suppression
in
damages
on
the
count
of
fires
resulting
from
the
negligent
rule
for
unlawful
act
of
any
forest
to
the
landowner
or
timber
operator
within
the
said
protective
units
or
any
other
person
or
the
corporation,
or
to
impair
any
other
rights
of
similar
nature
under
the
washington
forestry
laws
under
the
federal
laws
or
under
general
law.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
they
differ
mr.
ferguson
on
the
--
from
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
inclusive
of
the
arrangement
with
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
doub
--
mr.
doub,
i
want
to
come
back
to
a
question
and
i
think
mr.
justice
frankfurter
asked
you
of
the
(inaudible)
of
your
last
argument.
if
that's
a
fact
and
there
could
be
no
liability
upon
the
private
person
in
these
circumstances.
then
i
gather
under
the
tort
claims
act
it
should
be
then
upon
the
united
states.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
would
then
answer
the
case
without
going
into
the
question
of
fire
fighter
immunity,
would
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
i
--
if
i
understand
it,
what
the
government
would
like
--
would
be
a
statement
from
this
court
that
even
if
a
private
person
might
be
liable
in
these
circumstances
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
washington,
nevertheless
that
this
is
a
service
as
regards
whose
conduct
there
is
an
immunity
notwithstanding
the
tort
claims
act
whether
that's
read
in
by
way
of
exception
or
granted
upon
the
tort
claims
act
or
otherwise,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
tort
claims
act
in
words
at
least
says
that
there
is
--
show
liability
of
the
united
states,
if
a
private
person
would
be
liable
to
the
claimant
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
act
or
omission
occurred.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
your
point
is,
even
if
there
should
be
liability
upon
a
private
person
in
this
circumstance,
nevertheless,
we
should
ride
into
this
so
read
into
it,
or
find
in
it
somehow
an
immunity
in
the
case
of
fire
fighters,
federal
fire
fighters.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
ferguson,
may
i
ask?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
comment
on
mr.
doub
suggested
that
most
of
the
statutes
upon
which
you
rely
only
one
of
them
i
think
he
said
made
any
provision
for
civil
liability.
most
of
them
as
an
example
in
the
case
of
2523,
provide
a
sanction
of
criminal
sanction
shall
be
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor.
and
i
gather
this
argument
was
that
in
that
circumstance,
these
statutes
are
not
really
available
to
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
these
two
established
standard
of
care
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
even
though
they
make
their
own
provision
for
a
criminal
responsibility
and
such?
