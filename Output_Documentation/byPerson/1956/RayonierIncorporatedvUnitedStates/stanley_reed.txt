i
don't
--
i
don't
follow
you
there.
i
don't
understand.
as
i
understand
it,
the
government
has
made
it
simply
liable
for
its
negligence,
according
to
the
law
of
the
respective
states,
so
it
various
in
each
place.
now,
so
far
as
you
are
firefighters
and
so
far
as
you
have
the
responsibility
to
protect
them
both,
the
national
and
state
ground.
i
can
understand
your
argument
that
the
firefighters
shouldn't
be
liable
for
negligence.
but
if
–
but
if
the
–
if
there
happen
to
be
state
law
which
said
that
you
could
not
burn
or
slice
timbers
during
the
high
wind,
surely,
the
government
would
be
liable
