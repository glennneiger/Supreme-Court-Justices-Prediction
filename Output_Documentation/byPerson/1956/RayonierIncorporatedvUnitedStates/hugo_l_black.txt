justice
hugo
l.
black
operations
of
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
if
assuming
what
you
said
that
the
immunity
does
not
apply
with
the
statement
of
facts
that
you
just
referred
to
or
just
for
finding
of
negligence,
could
you
could
then
put
out
with
more
men
and
more
water
and
so
forth?
you
said
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
--
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
you
said
it
could
have
been
done,
that
you
had
--
you
could
have
done
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
weren't
talking
about
the
--
if
--
the
facts
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
they
could
be
proven
i
suppose
and
there's
no
immunity
that
might
be
enough
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
find
negligence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
reason
you
think
if
there's
immunity,
the
question
is
--
must
be
that
it's
reached?
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
just
one
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
don't
want
to
get
in
as
another
fact.
if
it
takes
long
to
answer,
don't
answer
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
--
it's
your
position
that
this
exact
complaint
against
the
private
landowner
would
show
a
cause
of
action
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
washington
or
would
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
had
done
a
10-year
lease
on
the
property
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
washington
state
law
with
the
fact
that
they
own
and
subject
them
to
the
latter.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
you
get
away
from
the
court
of
appeals'
holding
which
seems
to
--
it
seems
to
be
a
part
of
its
holding,
that
the
fire
injury
was
not
called
by
the
original
starting
of
the
fire,
that
that
was
very
remote.
and
that
you
had
to
look
to
what
happened
closer
to
the
date
the
fire
occurred,
that
the
destructive
fire
occurred
for
which
you
make
a
suit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
stated
--
you
say
that
they
decided
the
washington
law
rule
there,
do
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
negligence
has
to
be
governed
if
the
liability
has
to
be
governed
by
state
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
we
governed
by
a
--
must
we
follow
their
holdings
with
reference
to
the
point
that
i
have
just
asked
you
about?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
--
and
of
--
that
what
i'm
asking
you
is,
must
we
determine
that
question
by
determining
state
law
or
federal
law?
their
holding
that
you
could
not
attribute
it
in
liability
on
account
of
the
first
part.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
have
held
that
under
whatever
law
it
does
govern.
there
could
be
no
liability
for
the
starting
of
the
fire.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
we
would
have
to
reverse
them
on
that
point,
wouldn't
we,
in
order
to
decide
in
your
favor?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
that
particular
phase
of
your
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
if
we
go
to
the
second
part.
justice
hugo

how
long
was
it
made?
how
long
as
to
which
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
flared
up
again.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
we
--
if
we
--
if
you
have
to
depend
on
that
new
flaring
up
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
your
complaint,
what
is
the
negligence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
where
you
rely
on
these
statutes
and
if
so
forth
to
some
extent
to
your
statute
on
that
or
is
that
common
law
doctrine?
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
that
allows

justice
hugo

black
and
what's
the
bases
of
your
claim
of
a
duty,
is
it
the
good
samaritan
doctrine
at
that
point?
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
that
point.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this,
it's
maybe
one
thing,
you
say
they
favored
upon
the
plaintiffs,
they
favored
upon

law

at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
look
and
see
if
that's
right.
while
much
is
alleged
and
so
forth.
justice
hugo
l.
black
while
much
is
alleged
is,
their
argument
of
the
fire,
negligence
of
the
united
states'
failure
to
keep
the
railroad
right
of
way
clear.
i
mean
the
fact
of
the
matter
as
whether
negligence
in
the
failure
to
control
the
early
spread
of
the
fire.
we
read
the
amended
complaint
in
its
entirety,
depicting
a
situation
wherein
the
operation
occurring
after
the
fire
had
spread
to
the
1600-acre
fire
is
determinative
of
the
liability
of
the
government
if
any.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
is
it
or
not?
i'm
just
asking.
