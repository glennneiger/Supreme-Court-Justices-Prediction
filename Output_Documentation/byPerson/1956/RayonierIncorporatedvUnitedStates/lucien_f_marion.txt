mr.
lucien
f.
marion
may
it
please
this
honorable
court.
this
is
a
suit
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
asking
for
damages
caused
by
a
forest
fire
in
1951
which
damages
are
alleged
to
have
been
caused
by
the
negligence
of
the
forest
service.
i
might
call
your
honors
attention
at
this
point
that
the
fact
that
number
47
which
follows
this
case
immediately
is
a
companion
suit
being
by
other
plaintiffs
arising
out
of
the
same
fire.
the
case
is
here
on
a
challenge
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
complaint
to
state
facts
upon
which
a
claim
may
be
based.
the
district
judge
in
tacoma
held
that
they
sustained
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
under
the
circumstances,
all
of
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
must
be
accepted
as
true
and
construed
in
a
light,
the
most
favorable
plaintiff.
federal
tort
claims
act
makes
the
united
states
liable
for
the
negligent
acts
and
omissions
of
its
employees
under
circumstances
where
the
united
states
if
a
private
individual
would
be
liable
claimant
under
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
acts
and
omissions
occurred.
section
2680
of
title
28
contains
the
exceptions
to
the
waiver
of
the
immunity.
no
one
of
those
exceptions
is
here
involved
nor
urged
by
the
government.
particularly,
the
discretionary
function
exception
is
not
involved,
as
all
acts
and
omissions
complained
of
were
at
the
operational
level.
it
has
been
helpful
to
us
in
our
consideration
of
this
case
and
in
our
presentation
of
it
to
ask
ourselves
this
question
and
i
offer
it
because
i
think
it
will
also
be
helpful
to
your
honors.
let
us
assume
that
the
facts
here
were
exactly
transposed
that
the
united
states
with
the
plaintiff,
that
rayonier
incorporated
was
the
defendant
that
the
acts
and
omissions
complained
of
were
those
of
rayonier.
is
there
any
reason
in
fact
or
in
law
why
the
positions
could
not
be
transposed
in
all
material
respects?
and
if
so,
would
rayonier
be
liable
to
the
government?
since
rayonier,
he's
a
private
individual.
then
if
it
would
be
liable,
it
would
follow
that
--
by
that
test,
the
united
states
is
liable.
this
fire
started
on
the
olympic
peninsula
on
august
6,
1951.
it
started
on
land
which
the
defendant
owned,
had
control
of
and
free
of
unrestricted
access
to.
these
are
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
which
i
am
now
recounting.
it
started
when
fire
or
sparks
were
thrown
from
the
passing
locomotive
into
accumulations
of
inflammables
on
the
right
of
way
in
the
adjoining
property,
both
government
owned
and
controlled.
it
--
from
the
spot
far
stage,
it
spread
to
a
60
--
60-acre
carrier
were
it
was
controlled
for
about
a
day
and
then
jumped
into
a
large
area
of
cut-off
logged-off
lands
about
1600
acres
in
area.
it
was
contained
and
controlled
in
that
1600-acre
area
on
august
11th.
it
continued
to
burn
in
a
small
reform
in
this
logged-off
area
until
the
early
morning
hours
of
september
20th.
in
the
early
morning
hours
on
that
day,
i
think
around
two
or
three,
winds
carried
as
far
south
of
the
1600-acre
area
into
a
joining
slash,
young
growth
and
virgin
timber.
that
caused
the
fire
which
burned
an
area,
roughly
20
miles
in
an
east-west
direction
and
up
to
five
miles
in
a
north-south
direction.
after
the
fire
broke
away
on
the
20th
of
september,
there
was
nothing
anybody
could
do
about
it
and
no
negligence
is
claimed
from
that
occasion
on.
negligence
is
asserted
on
behalf
of
the
--
on
the
part
of
the
forest
service,
both
before
the
fire
ever
started
because
of
the
fire
hazardous
conditions
and
practices
carried
on,
on
this
government
owned
and
controlled
land.
negligence
is
claimed
and
failure
to
eliminate
or
extinguish
the
fire
immediately
in
the
spot
fire
stage,
again
at
the
60-acre
stage
and
again
during
the
1600-acre
stage.
there
were
adequate
men
and
equipment
and
water
available
at
all
times
to
extinguish
the
fire,
the
forest
service,
and
let's
say
this
too.
immediately,
upon
the
outbreak
of
the
fire
on
august
6th,
the
forest
service
was
notified.
they
immediately
stepped
in,
assumed
supervision,
direction
and
control
of
the
fire
fighting
at
all
times
thereafter.
but
during
this
whole
period
from
august
6
to
september
20th,
the
forest
service
actively
took
part
in
the
supervision,
direction
and
control
of
the
fire
fighting
activities.
this
was
known
to
petitioner
and
others
in
the
area.
and
the
petitioner
and
others
relied
upon
the
forest
service
having
been
induced
to
rely
upon
by
their
announced
position
and
relied
upon
the
forest
service
to
conduct
its
chore
in
a
prudent
manner.
it
is
highly
important,
your
honors,
that
you
have
in
mind
at
all
times
the
importance
of
the
practical
operation
and
the
physical
facts
here.
i
am
somewhat
concerned
that
the
court
of
appeals
apparently
did
not
appreciate
the
significance
of
it
and
its
importance
in
the
part
that
the
forest
service
plays
here
and
the
character
of
its
activities.
first,
have
in
mind
that
this
forested
area
on
the
olympic
peninsula
is
vast
in
timber
and
vast
areas
of
cutover
lands
and
that
the
government
is
by
far
the
largest
owner.
the
government's
ownerships
are
scattered
throughout
and
intermingled
with
private
ownerships,
so
that
you
cannot
go
very
far
in
one
direction
up
there
without
running
into
government
land
and
government
timber
which
is
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
forest
service.
the
forest
service
and
the
private
timber
operators
there
are
essentially
in
the
same
business
that
is
the
timber
business.
the
complaint
alleges
this
timber
was
held
by
the
government
with
pecuniary
gain
and
profit.it
is
sold
by
the
--
under
forest
service
jurisdiction
to
private
enterprise.
a
large
part
of
the
forest
service
activities,
in
fact,
the
bulk
of
it
has
to
do
with
the
development
of
timber
sales,
necessary
appraisals,
the
conduct
of
sales,
the
engineering
required
in
laying
out
the
sales,
laying
out
roads,
conducting
the
sales
and
then
supervising
the
logging
of
the
timber
in
the
course
of
those
sales
and
the
construction
of
roads
and
so
on.
forest
service
also
has
other
duties
such
as
they
maintain
some
forest
camps.
they
give
information
to
recreations
and
so
on.
now,
the
forest
service
in
common
with
all
the
other
timber
operators
there
are
naturally
concerned
about
the
fire.
the
forest
service,
however,
just
like
the
timber
operators,
does
not
in
itself
maintain
a
fire
department.
it
has
relatively
few
employees,
relatively
little
equipment
and
neither
the
forest
service
nor
any
other
operator
has
sufficient
equipment
or
men
of
which
to
cope
with
a
major
fire.
however,
because
of
this,
the
forest
service
and
the
private
industries
recognized
that
cooperation
is
necessary.
if
i
own
a
track
of
timber
here,
i
am
concerned
that
fire,
about
any
fire
starting
on
my
land
or
immediately
close
to
my
land
which
threatens
my
timber.
we
recognized
that
it
would
be
uneconomical
for
each
to
maintain
a
complete
fire
department
and
it
is
not
necessary
because
in
that
area
where
the
timber
industries
are
the
main
source
of
livelihood,
everyone
will
respond
willingly,
men
will
serve
in
fire
fighting
activities,
people
will
furnish
their
equipment.
now,
to
carry
out
this
battle
against
the
common
enemy,
both
the
forest
service
and
private
industries
have
what
they
call
a
fire
suppression
plan.
that
fire
suppression
plan
contains
a
list
of
the
persons
available
to
fight
fires,
the
equipment
to
available
to
fight
fires
and
how
those
persons
can
be
reached
and
brought
to
the
scene
of
the
fire.
that
is
the
type
of
plan
of
the
forest
service
has.
mr.
lucien
f.
marion
your
honor,
it's
not
a
matter
of
joining
in.
i
mean
rayonier
will
have
a
list
of
forest
service
employees.
it
will
have
a
list
of
ex-company's
employees
and
so
and
so,
(inaudible)
contractors
and
employees
and
the
list
of
their
equipment
where
they're
located.
it
occur
--
fire
occurs
on
rayonier's
land,
rayonier
will
step
in
--
mr.
lucien
f.
marion
there's
no
association,
your
honor.
the
point
is
that
if
rayonier
were
party
on
this
land
as
the
fire
had
started,
rayonier
would
send
its
men
there
and
they
would
take
charge
and
they
would
direct
it.
and
they
would
follow
rayonier's
plan
to
call
in
all
the
men
and
equipment
from
our
neighbors
as
well
as
our
own
to
supervise
this
and
fight
it.
and
that
is
the
case
with
the
forest
service
here.
those
are
the
facts.
it's
this
forest.
there
is
this
fire
suppression
plan
and
the
fact
that
they
do
not
maintain
a
fire
department.
let
me
also
point
out
that
under
the
statute,
16
united
states
code
5
--
51,
i
believe,
it
is
cited
in
our
brief.
the
forest
service
is
authorized
to
engage
in
fire
or
to
take
steps
necessary
to
protect
the
public
forest
from
fire
depredation.
no
place
in
the
statutes
to
refine
their
authorization
to
maintain
a
fire
department
for
the
public
at
large.
forest
service
is
also
authorized
to
cooperate
with
the
state
and
private
industries.
but
the
cooperation
which
i
have
just
described,
which
is
necessary,
and
that's
the
basis
for
this
so-called
cooperation.
may
i
also
point
out
that
the
state
of
washington
has
sets
standards
of
good
forestry
practices
for
private
industries
and
all
timber
owners,
those
standards
being
reflected
both
from
the
statutes
and
common
law
and
they
prescribed
certain
minimum
standards
to
reduce,
eliminate
or
minimize
the
fire
hazard
in
forest
areas.
those
standards
may
to
a
stranger
seem
high
but
they
obviously
are
not
because
the
timber
industry
has
operated
successfully
under
them
for
some
70
years.
now,
this
brings
us
to
--
with
that
factual
background,
your
honors,
district
judge
boldt
--
mr.
lucien
f.
marion
well,
they
say
that
it
should
be
unlawful
to
permit
accumulations
of
land
clearing
or
logging
debris,
slash
on
your
land
to
be
--
mr.
lucien
f.
marion
yes,
your
honor.
there
are
a
number
of
standards,
also
the
operation
of
trains
without
certain
training
--
mr.
lucien
f.
marion
trains,
locomotives.
mr.
lucien
f.
marion
gracious
no,
your
honor.
no,
sir.
but
if
i
step
in
to
fight
a
fire
and
i
may
have
responsibilities
for
fighting
that
fire
starting
from
several
sources,
if
i
step
in,
undertake
the
act
and
assumed
direction
and
control,
then
--
and
i
induce
reliance
upon
my
assumed
position
then
i
am
bound
to
that
course
of
conduct
which
any
man
in
that
position
is
bound.
there's
one
other
factual
thing
about
which
--
mr.
lucien
f.
marion
i
say
yes,
he
is
and
no
--
no
reason
why
he
should
not
be.
mr.
lucien
f.
marion
there
is
no
duty
to
respond
to
a
call
by
someone,
your
honor.
mr.
lucien
f.
marion
he
is
bound
by
--
that
same
guides
of
prudent
conduct
as
anyone
else.
we
must
not
be
confused
here,
your
honor,
in
the
--
what
might
be
negligence
under
emergent
conditions.
that's
not
involved
here.
and
in
that
connection,
i
wish
also
to
point
this
out
to
your
honors.
for
the
40
days
and
40
nights
during
which
this
fire
burned
the
1600-acre
area,
there
was
hardly
any
rain.
in
fact,
there
had
been
--
in
fact,
there's
no
rain
for
period
of
4
months
prior
to
that
time.
during
that
period
of
time,
forest
service
took
no
effort
to
seek
out
and
extinguish
the
fire.
although,
it
was
known
that
in
these
dry
periods,
the
prevailing
winds
are
northeasterly,
they
are
dry
winds,
the
humidity
was
low
and
in
the
lee
of
this
1600-acre
area
were
all
these
vast
stands
of
virgin
timber
which
are
endangered
by
any
fire
not
properly
handled.
this
was
maintained
by
the
district
ranger
only
on
a
patrol
basis
and
only
during
the
daytime.
after
the
normal
quitting
time
of
the
day,
there
was
no
one
on
duty
watching
this
area.
also,
it
is
significant
that
just
one
week
before
the
breakaway
on
september
20th,
fire
actually
did
blow
out
of
the
sparks
in
this
area
and
jumped
the
fire
alarms.
that
it
so
happened,
there
were
men
on
duty
at
that
time
and
they
were
able
to
extinguish
that
fire.
all
of
these
conditions
and
situations
were
known
to
the
district
ranger.
the
consequences
were
foreseeable.
now
your
honors,
district
judge
boldt
had
before
him
at
this
time,
the
case
of
dalehite
versus
united
states
decided
in
1953.
it
was
greatly
perplexed
and
said
before
that
case,
he
would
hold
a
complaint
sufficient
to
state
the
cause
of
action.
he
reasoned
this
way.
his
forest
service
employees
are
employees
of
the
government.
therefore,
they
are
public
employees.
they
were
fighting
fire.
therefore,
they
were
public
firemen.
the
court
of
appeals
likewise
rested
its
decision
upon
the
dalehite
case
in
most
respects.
i
want
to
urge
upon,
your
honors
--
mr.
lucien
f.
marion
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
lucien
f.
marion
it
deals
with
other
facets
of
this
under
state
law,
your
honor.
mr.
lucien
f.
marion
not
as
i
read
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
your
honor,
and
i
had
not
intended
to
get
into
that
phase
but
--
but
i
would
like
to
say
this.
that
under
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals,
they
assumed
that
--
had
there
been
negligence
in
their
duty
under
state
law
because
of
these
conditions
prior
to
the
fire
and
the
conduct
before
the
breakaway.
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
effect
that
even
though
there'd
be
negligence
in
the
forest
service
at
that
point,
they
become
immune
from
such
--
from
liability
for
subsequent
negligence
by
putting
on
their
firemen's
hats
and
proceeding
then
from
the
status
of
public
firemen.
i
wish
to
point
out
and
urge
the
reason
why
dalehite
is
not
applicable
in
the
first
instance.
there,
the
coast
guard
was
charged
apparently
with
negligence,
precise
nature
which
is
not
clear
from
the
opinions.
but
at
any
rate,
it
is
clear
that
the
coast
guard
did
not
supervise
or
undertake
the
direction
of
the
fire
fighting
at
the
texas
city
fire
or
did
they
induce
reliance
on
others
that
they
would
so
fight
the
fire
or
supervise
it
and
act
prudently.
the
local
authorities
there
were
in
charge
of
the
fire.
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
forest
service
was
the
actor.
it
did
take
over
supervision
and
did
induce
reliance.
second,
in
the
dalehite
case,
there
was
no
government
property
involved.
mr.
lucien
f.
marion
i
beg
you
pardon.
mr.
lucien
f.
marion
forest
service
stepped
in
immediately
after
the
fire
started
on
august
6th,
your
honor,
and
maintained
--
mr.
lucien
f.
marion
that's
correct.
i
mean
it's
the
same
fire
actually
burning
--
mr.
lucien
f.
marion
at
the
first
phase
of
it
on
august
6th
when
it
broke
out,
that
is
when
the
forest
service
stepped
in
and
it
continued
in
that
role
at
all
times
thereafter.
in
dalehite,
there
was
no
government
property
involved.
no
government
ships
on
fire,
no
government
docks,
whereas
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
forest
service
participation
in
fire
fighting
was
directly
associated
with
the
ownership
of
government
timber
and
was
for
the
direct
benefit
of
the
timber.
thirdly,
as
we
read
the
dalehite
case,
there
was
no
duty
established
on
the
coast
guard
and
duty
is
an
essential
element
of
actionable
negligence.
whereas
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
forest
service
had
duties
standing
from
several
sources
including
that
of
the
actor
or
volunteer
who
induces
reliance
and
also
as
a
landowner.
next,
in
the
--
as
we
understand
the
dalehite
facts,
the
coast
guard
do
not
even
get
into
the
act
of
fire
fighting
and
that
it
was
only
about
an
hour
between
the
time
that
the
fires
first
broke
out
in
the
time
of
the
terrific
explosion
which
caused
--
caused
the
damages.
here,
the
forest
service
was
in
this
from
the
beginning.
they
had
adequate
time
to
control
the
fire.
now
lastly,
the
forest
service
employees
were
not
public
firemen.
their
duties
were
associated
with
the
administration
of
government
timber.
they
had
no
authority
to
act,
otherwise,
and
in
connections
with
the
administration
of
government
timber.
that
should
be
compared
to
the
situation
with
this
public
firemen
immunity
as
normally
announced
and
that
is
the
city
fire
departments
where
they
are
maintained
for
the
benefit
of
one
and
all
in
the
city
to
protect
any
persons,
all
persons
and
property
in
the
city,
not
associated
with
city-owned
property.
and
those
cases
which
the
public
firemen
immunity
doctrine
is
announced.
then
they
associate
that
with
a
governmental
function
then
services
for
the
benefit
of
the
public
at
large.
now,
we
come
to
the
influence
of
the
case
of
indian
towing
company
against
the
united
states
decided
by
this
court
about
a
year
ago.
mr.
lucien
f.
marion
yes?
mr.
lucien
f.
marion
the
reason
for
the
difference,
your
honor,
lies
in
the
government's
failure
to
face
up
to
the
factual
situation
of
the
status
of
forest
service
employees
and
the
government
as
a
property
owner
here.
that
--
the
facts
which
i
have
described
in
which
are
contained
in
the
complaint
paint
that
picture.
now,
frankly
your
honor,
i
might
disagree
with
the
necessity
for
the
dalehite
pronouncement
in
connection
with
the
facts
of
that
case.
but
i
do
think
that
the
facts
are
so
dissimilar
that
that
is
not
controlling
law
in
the
case
at
bar.
insofar
as
the
philosophy
of
the
dalehite
case,
i've
been
pronouncing
it
dalehite.
i
don't
know
which
is
correct,
your
honor,
if
you'll
excuse
me.
mr.
lucien
f.
marion
correct.
indian
towing,
announced
by
this
court
about
a
year
ago,
establishes
several
things
which
are
very
pertinent
to
this
case.
first,
it
rejects
municipal
corporation
law
as
not
applicable
to
the
administration
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
the
public
firemen
immunity
theory
is
definitely
a
child
of
municipal
corporation
law.
it
is
found
nowhere
else
in
the
basis
of
immunity
stems
from
the
fact
that
the
cases
say
that
fire
fighting
is
a
governmental
function.
these
fire
departments
are
maintained
for
the
benefit
of
one
and
all
of
public's
function.
from
that
theory,
the
city
cannot
be
held
on
the
doctrine
of
respondeat
superior
for
the
negligence
of
its
firemen.
second,
indian
towing
establishes
that
the
public
function
or
governmental
character
of
an
employee's
activities
is
immaterial.
now,
that
is
consistent
with
many
holdings
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
it's
hard
to
justify
immunity
of
the
forest
service
as
being
a
public
engagement
in
light
of
the
holdings
of
liability
of
the
united
states
for
negligence
of
its
employees.
and
say
the
conduct
of
lighthouses,
the
operation
of
military
vehicles,
the
operation
of
military
airplanes,
operation
of
airport
controlled
towers,
coast
guard
rescue
services,
even
the
classic
example
cited
as
the
type
of
thing
for
which
the
government
should
be
liable,
namely,
the
negligence
of
a
male
truck
driver.
that
certainly
is
in
a
public
function
or
governmental
in
character.
it
--
lastly,
indian
towing
establishes
that
where
the
government
undertakes
to
act,
whether
you
call
it
a
volunteer,
an
actor,
a
good
samaritan
or
by
what
meaning.
if
he
undertakes
to
act
and
induces
reliance,
he
is
then
bound
to
act
prudently.
and
if
he
is
negligent
in
the
conduct
to
that
activity,
then
he
must
pay
for
the
consequences
of
his
negligence.
now,
your
honors,
if
we
reverse
the
situation
of
the
parties
here
and
there's
no
reason
why
rayonier
might
not
have
found
itself
and
precisely
the
same
situation,
then
i
say,
rayonier
would
have
been
liable
and
i
have
yet
to
hear
from
the
attorney
general,
to
whom
we
have
opposed
this
question
repeatedly,
would
rayonier
have
been
liable
or
not?
if
it
would,
then
it
follows
because
the
government's
liability
is
the
same
as
rayonier's
would
be.
it
follows
that
the
government
is
liable.
of
the
remaining
two
minutes
i
have,
your
honors,
i'd
like
to
reserve
mr.
justice.
mr.
lucien
f.
marion
yes,
indeed,
sir.
mr.
lucien
f.
marion
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
lucien
f.
marion
i
believe
your
honor's
impression
is
quite
incorrect.
but
the
percentage
of
time,
the
amount
of
dollars
involved
are
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lucien
f.
marion
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
lucien
f.
marion
they
maybe
maintained
by
the
forest
service.
they
maybe
maintained
by
estates.
there
are
even
private
watchtowers.
mr.
lucien
f.
marion
not
in
the
sense
--
mr.
lucien
f.
marion
no,
sir.
and
their
--
their
presence
there
and
their
activity
is
not
there
in
the
sense
which
protecting
anybody
and
everybody.
and
that's
the
essential
part
of
this
mixed
ownership
as
--
as
mixed
up
pattern
ownership
and
the
interest
which
each
timber
operator
has
in
the
same
end
result.
mr.
lucien
f.
marion
there's
no
--
mr.
lucien
f.
marion
well,
your
honor,
there
is
no
question
--
mr.
lucien
f.
marion
it
is
a
--
an
important
function
but
it
is
neither
a
major
function
nor
is
it
a
function
which
it
performs
except
in
connection
with
the
administration
of
federal
timber.
but
the
necessary
cooperation
of
all
timber
owners
is
the
essential
part.
mr.
lucien
f.
marion
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
lucien
f.
marion
mr.
justice
burton,
their
activities
are
all
associated
with
the
administration
of
federal
timber,
but
that
can
be
done
properly
only
by
concerning
itself
with
others
just
as
the
other
owners
concerned
themselves
with
federal
timber.
mr.
lucien
f.
marion
that
is
correct.
except,
federal
ownership
is
so
extensive
and
scattered
in
so
many
places
that
hardly
a
fire
can
occur
or
does
not
threaten
federal
timber
but
private
parties
themselves.
they
have
been
in
fight
fires.
they
take
over
control
and
it
will
be
the
case
of
forest
service
employees
are
standing
by
and
watching
others
to
supervise
this
but
lending
such
help
as
they
maybe
called
upon.
it's
completely
a
reciprocal,
cooperative
fire
department
if
in
the
aggregate
both
public
and
private
employees
are
to
be
regardless
as
a
fire
department.
that's
the
only
way
in
which
they
could
be
so
regard
it.
my
time
has
expired.
thank
you,
sir.
