mr.
marion,
i
do
not
like
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
interrupt
the
course
of
your
argument,
but
perhaps,
you
can
tell
me
this.
i've
got
issue
(inaudible)
that
the
scope
in
your
brief
referring
to
you
and
the
government
don't
come
as
an
issue
except
the
negligence.
in
other
words,
you
think
you
have
to
get
dalehite
out
of
the
way.
the
government
says
they
don't
reach
the
dalehite
case
and
talk
about
dalehite
as
they
come
to
it.
now,
why
is
there
that
difference
of
conception
of
the
safety
controversy
in
the
case?
i
assume
the
government
doesn't
reach
dalehite
which
means
that
the
government
is
within
the
exception
or
limitation
of
what
went
on
before
it
(inaudible)
and
argues
and
i
take
it
to
have
argued
extensively
in
the
beginning
that
it's
mainly
right.
but
since
you
don't
reach
dalehite,
you
on
the
other
hand,
since
you
have
to
get
dalehite
out
--
off
the
track
and
then
you
have
a
clear
--
a
clear
overhead.
i'm
adverting
to
the
question
that
i
think
is
explicit
(inaudible)
justice
harlan.
i
don't
mean
to
have
--
in
case
the
course
of
your
argument,
but
why
is
that
so?
why
should
there
be
such
an
essential
difference?
i
mean
(inaudible)
to
the
government
in
view
as
to
what
it
is
we
are
facing
with?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
not
--
they're
the
same,
which
ever
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
one
could
find
--
but
if
one
finds
that
washington
law
wouldn't
allow
recovery
against
the
private
sector
or
--
or
non-united
states
defendants
then
we
don't
have
to
reach
this
major
question
on
which
i
can
well
understand
the
government
would
like
to
get
a
ruling
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
that
satisfies
the
trial
if
we're
ruling
on
the
court
ground
that
there's
an
error
around
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
clearly
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
your
first
part
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
(inaudible)
then
--
then
it
is
avoidable,
it
isn't
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
i
don't
understand.
i've
read
your
brief
but
i've
read
your
outline,
your
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
question
that
decide
the
point.
if
you
--
at
least
--
i
don't
understand
why
you
argue,
the
way
you
do
in
your
brief
and
why
you
rely
on
the
case
by
(inaudible)
a
case
that
i
happened
to
like
very
much
(inaudible)
state
which
the
law
of
negligence
i
know
of,
otherwise
other
aspects
of
the
law.
i
don't
see
why
the
government
presents
me
with
this
brief.
it
makes
me
worry
about
the
leroy
case.
didn't
you
say
all
that
is
an
important
question?
let's
get
to
the
big
(inaudible)
arbitrary
to
hold
the
government
liable
for
fire
fighting?
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
like
you
to
be
led
astray
thinking
this
is
nicely
orderly
private
company
case.
and
then
i'm
told
i
must
decide
with
the
fire
fighting
and
the
special
unit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
afraid
to
fire
fight.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
really
--
really
--
that
advances
the
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
government
--
the
government
charges
the
cost
of
having
adopted
this
(inaudible)
that
the
government
charges
for
filing
to
the
(inaudible)
that
doesn't
make
those
agencies
(inaudible)
the
government,
that
hasn't
put
him
in
the
business
to
the
sense
for
the
businessman
in
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
denying
you
conclusion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
--
i
don't
like
to
have
a
bad
reading
for
those
conclusions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
to
turn
to
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
which
case
purported
to
construe
either
decisional
or
statutory
washington
law,
suppose
i
didn't
care
about
them,
the
common
law
or
the
other
in
the
states
where
--
what
is
it
--
where
is
the
utterance
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
you
say
that
this
is
wrong
after
which
you
invite
us
to
consider
washington
decisions
which
would
prove
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong.
just
go
through
the
text
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
i'll
--
i'll
ask
a
question
based
on
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
i
ask
you
a
question,
as
you've
told
me,
why
isn't
they
wrong?
which
--
which
brief
are
you
reading
from,
yours
or
the
arnhold
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
page?
justice
felix
frankfurter
79,
supposing
the
judge
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
this
--
79,
i
have
no
opinion.
i've
got
a
motion
for
judgment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
okay,
all
right,
79.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
right
on
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
the
court
of
appeals
in
your
view
erroneously
stated
what
is
involved.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
are
you
reading
from?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
some
of
these
things
bother
me,
i'm
not
terrified
in
disagreeing
with
them
on
the
construction
of
federal
statutes
or
disagree
with
them
if
they
did
what
you
just
said,
“we
now
construe
your
complaint
most
favorably
or
favorably
to
the
complainant.”
what
i
want
specifically
is
where
they
purport
(inaudible)
while
they
are
concerned,
there
couldn't
have
difference
to
that
on
local
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
my
judgment
against
care
as
to
what
property
law
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
don't.
all
i'm
asking,
is
there
(inaudible)
i
was
hoping
that
you
would
point
out
a
case,
a
washington
case
which
they
cite
for
positioning
the
case
and
would
you
say
is
wrong
and
then
i
was
going
to
ask
you,
please
give
me
the
one
occasion
which
you
think
prove
that
the
citation
is
wrong.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
--
they
didn't
cite
--
having
cited
these
--
state
as
washington
law,
did
they
state
a
proposition
of
law
purporting
that
it
was
washington
law,
which
you
say
is
demonstrable
not
washington
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
can
you
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
let's
have
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
puts
the
question
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
would
be
very
glad
to,
your
honor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
briefly,
do
you
think
the
propositions
(inaudible)
they
said
--
that
they've
put
under
which
is
not
(inaudible)
two
cases
are
enough,
they're
really
destructive.
but
the
reason
being
that
on
the
hope,
a
very
good
reading,
this
court
again
exercised
an
independent
judgment
on
local
law
of
washington
to
get
a
decision
and
this
conflict
say,
that
which
the
court
of
appeals
purported
to
give
its
local
law
is
clearly
not
local.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
--
going
to
say
they
have
--
there
is
--
(inaudible)
to
go
into
the
(inaudible)
law
which
washington
law
would
probably
get
lost
in
that
part
(inaudible)
