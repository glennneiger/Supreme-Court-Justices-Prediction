mr.
william
h.
ferguson
if
your
honors
please.
the
petitioners
here
are
23
families
who
reside
in
or
near
the
town
of
forks,
washington,
this
northwest
corner
to
the
state
of
washington,
and
seven
insurance
companies
who
are
subrogees
for
damages
to
homes
and
personal
property
destroyed
by
this
forest
fire
as
you've
heard
about
in
case
47.
the
action
here
was
brought
against
the
respondent,
united
states
against
the
port
angeles
and
western
railroad
and
against
fibreboard
products
company
as
joint
tortfeasors.
the
case
against
the
other
joint
tortfeasors
is
at
issue
in
the
district
court
in
seattle
awaiting
outcome
to
this
appeal.
the
complaint
charges
the
railroad
with
negligence
in
connection
with
the
origin
of
the
fire,
charges
fibreboard
with
negligence
in
connection
with
the
escape
of
the
fire
on
september
20th
and
charges
the
respondent
here
with
a
series
of
negligent
and
concurrently
negligent
acts,
17
in
all
in
connection
with
the
origin,
spread
and
final
escape
of
the
fire.
those
allegations
are
found
in
the
record
on
pages
15
to
18
inclusive.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
not
--
not
in
great
detail.
in
general,
they
are
approximately
the
same.
they
might
--
might
--
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
of
facts
and
present
claims,
yes,
your
honor.
the
appeal
here
is
to
review
a
judgment
on
the
pleadings
there
having
been
an
answer
filed
by
the
government
in
this
case
which
was
filed
before
the
decision
in
the
dalehite
case
i
might
say,
and
then
a
judgment
granted
on
the
pleadings
after
the
decision
came
down
in
the
dalehite
case
which
a
lower
court
decision
was
affirmed
in
the
ninth
circuit.
the
petitioners
here
joined
in
and
adopt
the
argument
by
mr.
marion
in
case
number
45.
the
complaint
here
briefly
alleges
that
the
fire
started
in
the
area
owned
by
the
united
states.
that
the
united
states
knew
at
the
time
of
the
combustible
herbage,
and
old
and
rotten
tires
and
had
the
right
to
abate
the
same
but
failed
to
require
the
abatement.
the
answer
of
the
government
admits
that
it
was
the
owner
and
alleges
it
notified
the
railroad
to
remove
these
combustibles.
the
complaint
also
alleged
that
the
u.s.
both
sold
and
traded
in
timber
for
a
profit
and
managed
and
cared
for
its
timberland
where
the
fire
started.
the
answer
admits
all
of
that
allegation
except
it
denied
it
acted
for
a
profit.
now,
the
government
filed
a
cross-complaint
in
this
case.
they
asked
judgment
over
against
the
railroad
for
everything
found
to
be
due
to
these
petitioners.
they
asked
for
a
judgment
against
the
railroad
for
$1,318,000
for
lost
timber.
they
asked
for
a
judgment
of
$104,458
for
wildlife
and
$140,070
for
fighting
the
fire.
this
is
not
a
noble
or
an
unprecedented
action
in
the
state
of
washington.
the
state
of
washington's
and
oregon,
four
states,
there
had
been
numerous
cases
of
this
sort.
private
individuals,
private
corporations
and
municipal
corporations
if
you
please,
have
been
held
liable
under
the
exact
state
of
facts
set
out
in
these
--
in
this
complaint.
these
cases
and
by
the
way
the
case
law
has
been
pretty
well
codified
in
washington
and
also
in
oregon
today,
these
cases
hold
that
there
is
a
duty
on
a
landowner
to
keep
his
premises
in
such
condition
as
not
to
invite
fire.
and
secondly,
that
if
a
fire
does
result
from
any
cause,
this
includes
trespassers
from
any
cause,
then
the
landowner
must
use
due
care
to
ex
--
due
care
to
extinguish
this
fire.
there's
a
series
of
statutes
--
that
--
that
are
codified
these
rules
of
due
care
which
are
set
out
in
our
--
in
the
appendix
of
our
brief.
now,
counsel
for
the
government
never
has
answered
the
question
that
mr.
marion
posed
in
this
court
and
in
the
circuit
court.
he
answered
it
this
way
that
the
--
under
the
circuit
court's
findings,
there
wouldn't
be
any
liability.
i
--
i'm
going
to
come
to
that
and
i
will
call
your
honor's
attention
to
it
before
the
time.
counsel
for
the
government
does
not
comment
on
or
seek
to
distinguish
these
cases
but
says
that
they
involve
facts
where
the
defendant
was
at
fault
in
the
origin
of
the
fire
or
was
owner
of
the
land
when
the
fire
occurred.
in
general,
that
is
a
correct
statement
but
it
is
precisely
the
situation
presented
in
our
pleadings.
we
contend
that
the
government
was
at
fault
in
connection
with
the
origin
of
the
fire
and
we
contend
and
plead
that
the
government
was
the
owner
of
the
property
where
the
fire
started.
in
addition,
we
have
cited
on
pages
22
and
23
of
the
opening
brief
the
case
called
great
northern
versus
oakley
which
was
a
case
where
a
fire
started
on
lands
of
another.
it
swept
over
the
land
that
a
receiver
of
a
bankrupt
company
had
a
contract
obligation
to
a
big
sludge.
the
washington
court
held
in
that
case
and
has
never
been
overruled
that
even
though
the
fire
did
not
start
through
any
fault
of
the
defendant
or
on
lands
owned
by
him,
he
had
a
right
to
abate
this
last
confounded,
commensurate
duty
on
him
to
abate.
under
the
washington
law
cited
in
our
brief
and
there's
about
15
pages,
the
early
part
of
our
brief
covering
washington
law
in
this
subject.
the
washington
law
pertaining
to
a
private
landowner,
the
washington
law
pertaining
to
a
municipal
corporation,
mind
you,
if
the
municipal
corporation
is
dealing
with
its
own
lands.
and
a
law
pertaining
the
washington
cases,
and
there's
two
of
them,
where
the
fire
has
been
started
and
controlled
and
managed
by
a
fire
warden,
state
fire
warden,
and
in
all
of
those
instances
appears
in
our
brief,
they
have
held
the
landowner
liable.
under
washington
law
--
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
that
--
that
is
by
statute
and
case
law
both,
that's
by
statute
and
the
statutes
are
set
out.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
in
our
opening
brief
and
the
appendix.
under
washington
law,
rayonier
or
any
private
person
would
be
liable
under
the
facts
pleaded.
it's
also
clear
that
the
town
of
forks
where
these
petitioners
reside
because
this
fire
went
to
the
town,
burned
about
half
the
town
and
the
wind
blew
--
wind
blew
--
changed
directions
at
that
time
and
saved
the
other
half
of
the
town.
it's
also
clear
that
the
town
of
forks,
that
the
town
of
forks
had
owned
the
land
where
this
fire
had
originally
started
six
weeks
before
the
catastrophe.
the
town
of
forks
would
have
been
liable
under
these
laws
of
--
that
are
--
the
decisions
of
the
states
of
washington
on
(inaudible).
and
that
would
be
true
even
if
the
--
if
the
forest
ranger
here,
mr.
floe,
had
been
a
fire
chief
of
that
city
and
there
we
cite
some
fire
chief
cases
with
where
a
particularly
one
in
the
city
of
toledo
case
where
the
--
that
which
happened
in
oregon
where
the
fire
chief
was
in
charge
of
the
fire
and
the
fire
burned
some
third
party
buildings.
so,
we
say
to
your
honors
that
no
matter
how
you
compare
this,
whether
you
compare
with
a
private
individual,
a
private
corporation
or
a
municipal
corporation,
if
you're
going
to
use
that
test,
the
government
would
be
liable.
now
the
government
in
the
--
in
an
effort
to
avoid
the
effect
of
these
decisions,
takes
the
position
that
was
a
helpless
serbian
owner
under
the
right
of
way
act
of
1875.
this
assumption
is
unwarranted
where
the
complaint
alleges
and
the
answer
admits
ownership,
control
and
unrestricted
access.
it
is
also
unwarranted
where
this
court
has
previously
held
that
a
railroad
can
neither
obtain
a
right
of
way
across
forest
service
lands
that
could
not
obtain
a
right
--
a
right
of
way
across
forest
service
lands
under
the
1875
act.
and
i'm
calling
your
honors
attention
to
chicago
and
milwaukee
versus
united
states,
244
u.s.
at
351
which
is
in
our
opening
brief
on
page
55.
it
is
also
contrary
to
the
actual
fact.
the
government
is
asking
this
court
to
adopt
the
municipal
corporation
doctrine
of
non-liability
for
fire
fighting
as
a
judicially
created
exception
of
the
tort
claims
act.
the
court
should
not
adopt
this
theory
for
the
following
reasons.
(1)
congress
was
aware
of
this
liability
whether
they
elected
not
to
make
a
special
exception.
on
pages
32
and
33
of
our
opening
brief,
we
have
listed
a
number
of
private
bills
where
the
--
where
prior
to
the
tort
claims
act,
congress
had
acted
to
relieve
negligence
of
the
government
employees
(inaudible).
in
addition
to
that,
congress
knew
of
the
bloedel
donovan
versus
united
states
case
in
the
court
of
claims
which
this
court
denied
certiorari
to
which
happened
some
--
just
nine
years
to
almost
to
the
day
before
this
fire
in
the
same
area,
with
the
same
ranger,
under
almost
identical
fire
conditions
and
the
government
was
held
liable
in
that
case
for
the
negligence
of
this
same
ranger.
as
this
court
pointed
out
also
in
the
indian
towing
case,
the
federal
tort
claims
act
touched
the
ground
from
under
that
doctrine.
it
is
not
self-defeating
by
covertly
embedding
the
casuistries
of
municipal
liability
for
torts.
and
thirdly,
the
government
has
sought
in
the
past
and
here
seeks
the
status
of
a
private
person,
in
other
words
the
government
here
is
not
acting
as
a
municipal
corporation
putting
out
a
fire
and
not
charging
anybody
for
it
in
the
complaint
which
is
part
of
the
record
here
to
their
answer
in
the
cross-complaint,
they
are
suing
the
railroad
for
among
other
things
that
caused
to
putting
this
fire
out.
they
have
also
in
the
chesapeake,
ohio
case
and
the
spokane
international
railroad
case,
both
of
which
are
cited
in
the
brief
sued
others
for
the
cause
of
putting
out
the
fire.
this
court
--
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
i
do
--
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
this
court
said
in
the
yellow
cab
case,
340
u.s.
543,
that
if
the
government
could
sue
a
joint
tortfeasor
for
contribution,
it
was
liable
to
a
joint
tortfeasor
for
contribution.
and
my
only
point
is
this,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
i
--
i'm
not
--
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
my
--
my
position
is
this
your
honor,
that
if
they
are
--
they
are
a
private
party
when
they
want
to
bring
this
suit
for
damage
to
their
timber
or
for
fire
fighting,
they
are
not
a
public
fireman
when
they
are
on
the
other
side
of
a
lawsuit,
they've
got
to
be
(inaudible).
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
the
washington
statutes.
we
have
pleaded,
as
your
honor
will
see
in
the
--
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
we
have
a
matter
of
fact,
we
have
pleaded
the
whole
series
of
those
washington
statutes
that
they
are
generally
speaking
--
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
the
--
they
are
standard
of
care
statutes
your
honor,
and
they
start
with
appendix
1,
and
there
are
series
of
statutes.
we
--
we
are
relying
on
all
of
them,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
well,
we
are
not
--
we
are
not
saying
here
that
--
that
they
actually
went
out
and
kindled
them.
but
we
are
--
we
are
saying
that
these
statutes
and
the
case
law
that
we
have
cited
from
washington
illustrate
that
this
statutes
are
the
standard
of
care
applied
by
the
courts
in
washington
and
that
even
though
they
have
held
a
person
--
they
have
held
a
person
for
instance
in
washington,
under
the
same
duty
as
that
particular
statute.
if
the
fire
was
kindled
by
someone
else
even
including
a
trespasser,
he
had
reasonable
duty
after
notice
to
put
it
out.
that
--
that
is
the
point
from
it.
i
might
say
in
passing
in
connection
with
the
matter
of
suing
for
fire
fighting
cost,
the
cities
historically,
public
firemen,
that
is,
city
fire
departments
do
not
so
for
that
cost
of
putting
out
fire.
but
now
even
if
this
court
did
decide
to
adopt
the
doctrine
of
public
fireman,
there
is
no
excuse
of
emergency
in
this
case.
the
government
had
from
august
the
6th
to
september
the
20th
put
this
fire
out
to
use
due
care,
was
in
there
--
was
a
very
small
smoldering
fire
at
that
time
and
that's
one
of
the
principal
claims
of
negligence.
and
they
had
several
years
under
the
pleadings
to
abate
the
debris
that
caused
the
origin
of
the
fire.
secondly,
that
courts
have
never
excused
municipal
corporations
for
failure
in
the
housekeeping
functions.
we
cite
cases
in
the
brief
for
instance
where
there
were
defective
floors
in
a
fire
station
and
things
like
that.
this
is
housekeeping,
this
is
prior
to
the
origin
of
the
fire.
the
new
york
cases
are
in
conflict
and
in
steitz
versus
beacon
which
is
the
one
case
cited
in
the
dalehite
case
on
this
matter,
that
steitz
versus
beacon
case
expressly
recognized
the
exception
which
is
where
there's
a
statutory
duty
imposed
on
the
person
to
put
out
the
fire.
and
that
is
the
situation
that
exists
here.
in
addition
to
that,
the
government
has
the
benefit
of
the
duties
imposed
by
these
statutes
in
common
laws
in
washington
in
protection
of
the
timber
owned
and
timberlands
owned
in
washington
by
the
government.
there
is
more
land
as
it
appears
in
the
brief
in
private
hands,
forest
lands
and
private
hands
than
there
is
government
hands.
and
it's
only
fair
that
the
government
should
share
its
fair
burden
of
these
duties
on
the
same
basis.
now
in
connection
with
dalehite,
both
the
lower
courts
clearly
based
their
decision
on
dalehite.
both
of
these
decisions
were
before
the
indian
towing
case.
i'd
like
to
just
take
a
moment
to
point
out
the
factual
distinctions
between
this
case
and
dalehite.
in
the
dalehite
case,
there
was
no
government
property
involved,
the
cargo
in
the
ship
were
french
property.
in
the
instant
case,
it's
government
property
that's
caught
on
fire.
in
the
dalehite
case
there
was
no
duty.
this
court
and
the
circuit
court
found
there
was
no
duty
of
any
kind
on
the
coast
guard
and
no
duty
was
ever
pointed
out
on
the
coast
guard.
in
this
case,
there's
a
statutory
and
a
common
law
duty
on
the
government
from
that
property
ownership.
in
the
dalehite
case,
the
coast
guard
never
fought
the
fire.
in
this
case,
they
did
fight
the
fire
from
the
inception,
that
is
they
took
control
but
they
didn't
fight
it
sufficiently
we
say.
in
the
dalehite
case,
there
was
an
emergency.
mr.
justice
jackson's
dissenting
opinion
shows
that
the
explosion
occurred
less
than
one
hour
after
the
fire
started.
in
this
instance
there
were
some
46
days,
put
it
out,
they
could
easily
had
been
put
out.
in
the
dalehite
case,
there
was
no
notice
shown
that
the
coast
guard
even
knew
about
the
fire
before
the
explosion.
in
this
instance,
they
were
notified
immediately,
took
all
the
results
notices.
they
certainly
have
plenty
of
notices.
but
the
mostly
important
distinction
of
all,
in
the
dalehite
case
it
was
unprecedented
that
this
fertilizer
would
explode.
nobody
knew
although
they
had
been
handling
it
for
seven
or
eight
or
nine
years
that
it
would
explode.
it
was
unprecedented
that
it
would
explode
but
in
a
forest
fire,
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
said
in
speaking
of
--
in
a
statute
very
similar
to
one
of
the
ones
in
our
book,
it
is
cited
in
our
brief.
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
said
that
there
is
nothing
more
dangers
to
the
life
and
to
property
than
a
forest
fire.
i
think
that
anyone
who
has
lived
in
the
west
will
realize
that.
indian
towing
rejects
the
municipal
corporation
law.
fire
fighting
immunity
is
at
the
heart
of
municipal
corporation
--
of
the
municipal
corporation
exemption
and
should
likewise
be
rejected.
now,
the
circuit
court
found
that
these
statutes
of
washington
created
liability
without
fault.
the
district
court
didn't
make
any
such
findings.
the
circuit
court
did.
the
petitioners
here
have
alleged
a
series
of
17
acts
of
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
government.
the
petitioners
have
not
pleaded
nor
have
they
relied
upon
liability
without
faults.
this
court
has
many
times
said,
it
does
not
decide
hypothetical
questions.
we
submit
this
is
a
hypothetical
question.
those
statutes
in
--
in
our
opening
brief
of
washington
statutes
have
been
construed
on
several
occasions
by
the
supreme
court
of
washington,
the
latest
in
1955
in
the
canyon
lumber
case
cited
in
the
brief.
the
supreme
court
of
washington
en
banc
in
1955
and
just
about
two
months
or
three
months
before
the
circuit
court
decision,
which
didn't
refer
to
it
or
any
other
authority
for
its
findings,
held
that
that
act
was
constitutional
and
was
not
liability
without
fault.
we
say
that
it
is
only
a
codification
of
the
rules
of
the
standard
are
fair.
i
believe
that
is
a
fair
holding.
if
the
circuit
court
decision
is
allowed
to
stand,
it
has
defect
upon
the
constitutionality
of
all
of
those
fire
statutes.
the
government
here
has
been
confusing
liability
without
fault
with
negligence
per
se,
that
in
many
cases
under
the
tort
claims
act
in
the
10
years
since
its
passage
whereby
the
government
has
been
held
liable
for
breach
of
the
statute
or
a
city
ordinance
and
on
the
bases
of
liability
--
of
negligence
per
se.
on
proximate
cause,
the
circuit
court
held
that
the
last
of
the
government's
negligence
acts
that
is
the
failure
to
extinguish
the
fire
between
august
the
11th
and
september
the
20th
was
the
sole
proximate
cost
of
the
fire.
the
government
did
not
plead
this
as
an
intervening
cause.
they
accepted
this
as
to
wipe
out
the
petitioner's
claim
against
the
railroad
which
respondent
says
in
its
brief
was
this
so
--
was
solely
responsible
for
this
damage
and
it
also
wipes
out
the
government's
claim
against
the
railroad.
the
fire
started
on
august
the
6th,
it
was
still
the
same
fire
when
the
damage
was
caused.
california
court
in
osborne
versus
woody
cited
in
our
brief
says,
“a
fire
is
one
fire
no
matter
how
far
it
goes.”
and
the
minnesota
court
said
in
ferrell
versus
minnesota,
“a
fire
is
the
same
fire
even
if
it's
joined
by
another
fire.”
here
there
was
a
series
of
consecutive
negligent
acts
by
the
same
person,
mr.
floe,
the
forest
ranger.
they
started
with
the
housekeeping
function
which
was
permitting
inflammable
debris
to
accumulate
on
government
land.
at
that
time
it
was
clear
he
was
wearing
his
forester's
hat.
these
negligent
acts
and
with
his
failing
to
put
out
a
fire
in
the
1600-acre
estate
and
permitting
the
fire
to
escape,
it
was
this
same
man
wearing
a
fireman's
hat.
the
effect
of
the
circuit
court
decision
is
that
floe's
negligence
while
wearing
a
fireman's
hat
was
a
superseding
intervening
cause
and
wiped
out
floe's
negligence
in
his
forester's
hat,
or
that
floe's
own
conduct
was
so
unforeseeable
that
it
necessarily
intervened
and
this
is
holding
this
is
a
matter
of
law.
this
doctrine
has
never
been
adopted
by
any
court.
it
is
contrary
to
the
washington
law
which
governed.
under
washington
law
approximate
cause
is
usually
a
question
for
the
jury
or
the
fact-finding.
in
prince
versus
chehalis
cited
in
the
brief,
the
court
said
that
with
regard
to
fire
cases
and
proximate
cause
said
proximate
cause
is
not
the
last
act
or
the
act
nearest
the
injury,
but
one
that
actively
aided
in
producing
the
injury.
in
the
theatre
case
cited
in
the
brief,
the
washington
court
held,
another
fire
case,
that
a
defective
oil
tank
installed
seven
years
before
the
accident
was
not
superseded
by
the
intervening
negligence
of
the
man
filling
that
tank
seven
years
later,
that
it
was
only
a
concurrent
cause.
and
in
the
poling
case
the
washington
court
held
that
even
a
subsequent
criminal
act
in
this
was
not
an
intervening
cause.
in
that
instance,
they
had
come
in
the
night,
taken
some
plugs
out
of
a
fuel
tank.
this
court
should
use
its
power
to
correct
these
holdings
or
there
will
be
a
great
injustice
to
these
petitioners.
there
will
be
substantial
loss
to
the
government
on
it's
cross-complaint
and
it
will
confuse
and
conflict
with
the
negligence
law
for
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
well,
they
arrived
at
that
by
this
unusual
method.
the
pleadings,
both
the
complaint
and
the
answer
make
it
clear
the
government
is
the
owner
of
the
land
where
the
fire
started.
the
opening
brief
in
the
--
in
the
--
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
they
held
that,
but
as
i
pointed
out,
that's
found
absolutely
contrary
to
the
expressed
statements
to
the
complaint
and
the
answer
and
your
own
holding
in
the
chicago
milwaukee
case
that
i
called
here,
placed
both
as
a
question
of
fact
and
a
question
of
law
if
possible.
that
is
just
impossible
when
they
arrived
at
that
because
there
was
something
outside
of
the
record.
we
didn't
go
outside
the
record
but
there
was
--
it's
found
outside
of
the
record
and
they
came
to
that
conclusion.
that
happened
to
be
incorrect.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
no,
there
is
nothing.
there
is
nothing
like
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
there
is
no
--
there
are
no
holdings
of
any
kind
on
the
dominant
or
servient
tenant
is
in
the
united
states
except
one
that
i
know
of.
and
on
that
one
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
also
cited
by
the
government,
on
--
in
that
one
the
third
party
who
dropped
suit
against
both
the
dominant
and
the
servient
tenant
was
allowed
to
recover
against
both
of
it.
there
was
a
suit
over
between
the
dominant
and
servient
tenants
but
the
--
the
--
there
is
no
such
rule
in
washington.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
yes.
they
made
an
assumption
--
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
that
--
that's
how
the
circuit
court
arrived
at
this
conclusion
plus
approximate
cause,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
well,
the
law
in
washington
is
this,
it's
a
fact,
if
the
fire
starts
on
your
property
without
your
fault,
you
have
to
put
it
out
or
use
reasonable
care
to
put
it
out.
now
if
it
--
you
can't
put
it
out
by
reasonable
care
there's
no
liability,
that's
the
test.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
well
my
explanation
of
it
is
simply
this,
there
was
something
outside
of
the
record,
they
--
we
did
not
try
to
answer
it.
we
didn't
try
to
clarify
it,
which
we
have
done
here
but
they
adopted
it.
i
would
like
to
reserve
anything
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
if
the
court
please.
we
pleaded
in
our
complaint
that
the
government
owned
the
land
where
the
fire
started
by
that
and
we
were
specific
about
it.
we
meant
the
land
where
the
railroad
was,
the
right
of
way,
that
is
what
the
allegations
and
complaints
say.
we
prepared
proof
to
that
allegation.
so
that
is
the
way
it
stands
at
this
moment.
counsel
has
mentioned
the
fact
that
he
can't
find
a
case
where
a
fire
originated
on
other
property
and
then
came
to
the
property
of
another,
the
case
in
exactly
in
point
is
great
northern
versus
oakley
where
exactly
that
situation
happened.
but
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
that
that
isn't
the
situation
here.
this
fire
started
on
property
owned
by
the
government.
that
is
what
the
pleadings
say
as
what
we
meant
them
to
say.
there
isn't
any
question
about
it
to
the
fact.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
we
have
--
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
not
unless
they
had
a
right
of
control.
under
the
washington
law,
if
you
own
it
and
you
do
not
have
a
right
of
control
provided
to
do
something
about
it
after
you
know
of
the
danger,
then
there's
no
liability.
we
do
have
a
number
of
landlord
and
tenant
cases,
trackage
agreement
cases,
licensee
and
licensor
cases
and
they're
all
in
our
brief
where
they
do
hold
that
--
that
there
is
a
--
a
right
of
control,
a
right
to
do
something
after
notice,
then
there
is
liability,
that's
all.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
yes.
your
honor,
that
is
the
question
of
proximate
cause.
the
--
the
circuit
court
held,
we
believe
improperly
and
it's
one
of
the
questions
we
presented
here
for
certiorari,
held
improperly
that
a
person,
the
same
person
can
cause
an
intervening
can
--
can
intervene
his
own
negligence,
that
there's
no
authority
for
such
and
start
any
proposition
in
the
washington
law
which
is
supposed
to
governed
there.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
we
--
we
say
they
decided
not
only
washington
law
but
the
general
law.
there
is
no
--
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
yes.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
not
--
not
when
it
--
when
it
is
--
i
think
you
have
the
right
in
your
right
of
supervising,
correcting
mistakes,
i
think
you
have
a
right
to
correct
a
mistake
as
crucially
erroneous
as
that
one.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
well,
i
think
it
would
be
a
matter
of
state
law,
your
honor,
i'm
afraid
it
would
be
a
matter
of
state
law.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
yes,
but
they
have
held
that
your
honor,
contrary
to
state
law
which
state
--
was
supposed
to
follow
because
the
tort
claims
act
--
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
on
your
--
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
on
that
particular
phase
of
it.
you
--
you
would
have
to
reverse
them,
the
finding
on
our
favor.
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
yes.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
well,
there
is
--
there's
only
one
fire
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
it
was
a
fire
that
started
on
august
6th
then
it
went
to
august
11th
and
then
it
--
then
it
smoldered
in
a
1600-acre
fire
from
august
11th
to
september
the
20th
which
appeared
roughly
40
days.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
yes.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
yes.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
well,
we
--
we
alleged
out
of
the
17
acts
of
negligence,
about
13
or
14
of
them
relates
probably
to
that
phase
of
it.
that
is
negligence
in
failing
to
put
the
fire
out,
failing
to
use
water,
(inaudible)
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
well
--
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
i
would
say
primarily
that
is
common
law
doctrine
because
at
that
point
your
honor,
the
fire
has
escaped
now
once
from
the
government
land.
it's
escaped
to
a
combination
of
government
land
and
private
land
and
they
are
in
control
at
that
point
under
a
duty
which
you'll
find
in
a
washington
case
as
the
duty
of
pursuing
your
--
if
a
fire
escapes,
you're
supposed
to
pursue
that
fire.
that
is
their
situation
at
that
point.
they
have
pursued
it
but
they
have
failed
to
put
it
out.
and
they
have
failed
for
instance
the
things
we
alleged
at
that
point
is
that
in
spite
of
notice
of
decreasing
humidity
and
northeast
winds,
they
failed
to
use
night
patrols
and
that
it
did
escape
during
the
night.
they
failed
to
have
a
watchman
or
a
lookout
or
anything
of
that
sort
to
(inaudible)
it
getting
away.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
well,
no.
no,
no.
our
duty,
that
duty
at
that
point
--
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
the
duty
at
that
point
is
a
duty
that
is
imposed
by
these
statutes
and
our
common
law
which
was
the
duty
to
put
it
out
before
it
escaped
and
before
it
escaped
from
your
own
land
and
if
--
it
does
--
it
do
not
do
that.
the
duty
extends
to
continue
to
fight
it
and
continue
to
put
it
out
before
it
causes
someone
damage.
no
damage
had
been
caused
in
the
first
40
days.
all
the
damage
took
place
after
the
40
days.
there
is
no
damage
here
in
the
first
part.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
yes.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
it
is.
would
be
alike
the
traffic
light
case
your
honor
where
a
city
passes
an
ordinance
that
is
against
the
law
to
run
through
the
traffic
light,
that
you
do
run
through
the
traffic
light
and
you
injure
somebody,
that
person
sues
you
and
alleges
that
as
part
of
the
negligence.
but
on
pages
12
to
23
of
our
opening
brief,
we
have
cited
a
number
of
washington
cases,
there
are
also
cases
from
other
timber
states
where
the
same
kind
of
statutes
are
considered
where
civil
liability
was
held
applicable.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
they
do
--
they
do
--
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
that's
right.
that
--
that
is
the
holding
of
most
of
the
courts.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
well,
the
court
of
appeals,
you
see,
the
court
of
appeals
on
that
--
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
no,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
say
that.
the
court
of
appeals
eliminated
that
by
saying
that
the
last
act
was
a
proximate
cause.
that
--
and
that
the
last
act
that
is,
the
escape
of
the
fire
the
last
time,
the
last
time
of
escape,
there's
actually
three
escapes.
but
the
last
escape
was
a
proximate
cause,
chopped
it
off
there
and
said
that
at
that
time
the
government,
the
same
man
was
a
public
fireman.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
yes.
and
held
they
were
absolute
liability
statutes
which
would
make
them
unconstitutional
in
washington.
that
--
it
said
they
were
absolute
liability
statutes,
certainly.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
yes.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
yes.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
i'll
have
--
i'll
have
to
get
it.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
i'm
reading
now
from
the
arnhold
record
--
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
page
--
i
think
is
--
it
starts
on
page
79.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
yes.
and
now
this
by
the
way
--
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
oh,
i
should
say
it's
number
45,
the
record
(inaudible)
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
i'm
sorry.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
now,
your
honor,
keep
in
mind
that
in
deciding
this
case
the
principal
opinion
was
written
in
the
rayonier
versus
arnhold
case.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
so
we
--
we
have
to
--
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
now,
your
honor
--
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
now,
your
honor
will
notice
a
start
discussing
dalehite
first
and
then
i
say
they
also
mentioned
the
feres
case.
then
they
say
that
--
they'd
go
on
to
say
that
the
control
of
complications
of
forest
lands
is
much
appropriate
function.
at
that
point
they're
still
on
federal
law
and
they're
--
they
are
deciding
that
--
this
under
the
dalehite
case.
there's
no
remedy
here.
and
then
they'd
go
on
to
say
the
dalehite
compels
the
conclusion
that
the
government
--
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
i'm
now
down
at
83.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
in
our
opinion,
the
dalehite
case
compels
the
conclusion
that
the
government
when
intervening
in
the
prevention
and
control
of
forest
fires
may
not
be
said
to
assume
the
common
law
obligation
of
a
volunteer.
we
do
not
regard
united
states
had
fire
fighter
agreement
with
the
state
of
washington
undertaken
to
protect
against
forest
fires
as
creating
a
distinction
rendering
the
dalehite
case
inapplicable.
in
entering
into
the
agreement,
even
if
it
be
considered
a
binding
contract,
the
complaint
falls
short
of
alleging
a
binding
contract
and
there
is
no
allegation
of
consideration
for
the
government's
promise.
the
government
did
no
more
than
undertake
the
reformed
services
in
a
public
pass.
i
might
say
in
connection
with
that,
i
think
they
are
misconstruing
at
that
point
a
federal
statute
because
there
are
federal
statutes
which
are
in
the
brief
pointing
out
that
the
consideration
for
that
contract
is,
the
state
and
private
people
putting
up
at
least
half
--
one
half
of
the
money.
it's
a
matter
--
it's
a
consideration
as
a
matter
of
law.
and
they
go
on
to
say
having
concluded
that
the
alleged
neglected
a
fireman
to
use
reasonable
methods
to
control
the
fire
within
the
1600-acre
track
was
the
proximate
cause
of
this
(inaudible)
fire
to
appellants'
lands.
and
that
in
as
much
as
the
fire
fighters
where
acting
as
public
servants
to
the
extent
that
their
activities
were
without
the
area
of
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
contained
in
the
tort
claims
act,
we
might
well
conclude
this
but
rayonier
makes
other
claims
which
we
perceived
discussed.
then,
they
say,
the
principal
allegation
relate
to
the
failure
of
the
government
to
keep
the
railroad
right
of
way,
the
starting
point
of
a
fire
and
the
adjoining
public
lands
free
and
clear
of
inflammable
materials.
and
once
the
fire
started,
they
had
to
take
precautions
to
extinguish
it
before
it
reached
the
1600-acre
track.
now
at
that
point
i
say,
they
have
misconstrued
the
rules
of
this
court
and
the
rules
of
all
federal
courts
by
construing
a
complaint
contrary
to
its
terms,
in
other
words,
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
or
on
a
motion
for
judgment
on
the
pleadings.
the
favored
party,
that
is
the
person
who
has
filed
a
complaint,
the
entire
--
they
have
the
inferences
construed
for
him.
instead
of
that,
they
have
con
--
they
have
read
in
to
it
something
that
is
absolutely
contrary
to
its
term
and
i
say
that
they
have
made
a
error
in
federal
law
at
that
point.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
yes.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
all
right.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
right.
then,
next
goes
on
to
say
it's
alleged
that
liability
may
be
predicated
on
the
government's
failure
to
maintain
the
railroad
right
of
way
in
satisfactory
condition.
the
rail
--
the
right
of
way
held
by
the
railroad
was
at
least
to
throw
in
to
an
easement
and
they
cite
thompson
on
real
property
for
that,
but
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
as
pointed
out
in
your
chicago
milwaukee
case,
it's
not
an
easement
it's
a
privilege.
that
was
the
chicago
milwaukee
case
cited
in
our
brief
which
was
decided
by
this
court
that
there
could
not
be
an
easement
under
these
circumstances.
ordinarily,
the
servient
estate
is
under
no
duty
to
make
imperatives,
the
duty
resting
on
the
dominant
tenant
who
alone
is
liable
for
injury
to
third
parties.
the
allegation
in
the
complaint
that
the
government
had
a
right
to
enter
and
inspect
the
right
of
way
does
not
--
does
not
alter
this.
now,
what
they've
done
there
has
failed
to
take
into
consideration
that
we
alleged
absolute
control
rather
than
just
a
right
to
enter
and
inspect.
reservation
of
social
right
is
not
equivalent
to
an
assumption
of
the
obligation
to
refer
and
maintain
the
right
of
way.
the
servient
tenant
does
not
undertake
to
clean
up
such
rabble
as
the
railroad
may
accumulate
it.
i
say
the
mistake
is
in
determining
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
that
there's
a
servient
tenant
in
this
case.
the
allegation
is
in
the
--
and
the
answer
are
both
owner
(inaudible)
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
yes.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
right,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
there
isn't
really
any
question
of
fact
because
we
allege
ownership
and
the
government
admitted
it
in
our
case.
the
rayonier
case
didn't
get
to
answer
but
our
case
got
to
answer
that
if
the
--
it
was
plain,
that
it
was
alleged
as
ownership
and
it
was
alleged
and
admitted
as
ownership.
there
was
no
real
question
of
fact
but
contrary
to
that,
this
court
found
--
the
circuit
court
found
that
it
was
a
servient
and
dominant
tenants
which
--
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
--
which
wasn't
mentioned
in
our
brief
and
which
wasn't
argued
in
that
court.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
(inaudible)
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
well,
that
--
that
would
be
--
that
probably
would
be.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
i
would
say
yes.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
yes.
but
unfortunately
your
honor,
they
didn't
cite
a
washington
case.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
well,
all
right
i
can
--
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
i
can
give
you
that.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
on
page
--
looking
for
this
in
--
i'm
looking
for
this
liability
without
fault,
unfortunately
(inaudible)
it's
right
at
the
end.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
i'd
be
very
happy
--
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
yes,
in
--
in
our
case.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
yes.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
you
want
us
to
put
us
that
in
our
memo
also,
fine.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
yes.
mr.
william
h.
ferguson
yes,
your
honor.
