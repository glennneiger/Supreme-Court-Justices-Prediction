there's
no

there's
no
association
of

unknown

well,
what
--
what
do
those
standards
that
are
applicable
here?
unknown
speaker
are
those
applicable
to
this
case?
unknown
speaker
and
if
he
fails
to
come
when
you
call
for
him,
he
is
liable
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
only
if
does
respond
then
he
must
make
no
errors.

unknown
speaker
before
or
after
the
breakaway?
before
the
breakaway?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
--
i
mean
the
first
fire.
unknown
speaker
same
fire?
the
first
phase
of
it?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
just
--
unknown
speaker
--
one
question
i
--
i
have
a
question.
i
don't
know
anything.
i
have
here
the
question
that
the
forest
service
may
--
one
of
its
chief
responsibilities
in
fighting
the
fire
or
forest
fires.
unknown
speaker
does
that
apply
to
this
group
that
it
was
during
the
forest
service?
unknown
speaker
what
are
these
(voice

--
towers
i
see
around
every
place
where
--
unknown
speaker
these
towers
where
a
man
would
sit
and
watch
the
fires,
are
they
forest
service?
unknown
speaker
you
--
you
don't
consider
fire
fighting
in
the
forest
as
one
of
the
essential
activities
of
the
forest
service.
unknown
speaker
not
as
a
public
fireman.
unknown
speaker
i
assume
it
was
quite
contrary
out
west
of
the
forest
service
--
i
don't
know
what
portion
of
their
budget
is
devoted
to
fire
fighting
but
so
far
as
(inaudible)
is
a
very
important
function
that
they
formed
--
unknown
speaker
--
every
forester
as
if
some
of
them
had
to
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
drop
them
in
from
planes,
it's
very
highly
organized.
unknown
speaker
is
that
--
is
that
by
statute?
unknown
speaker
in
--
in
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
what
--
what
is
the
statute
to
rely
on,
the
washington
statute?
unknown
speaker
i
have
--
i
have
in
here
the
appendix.
unknown
speaker
well
they
seem
--
unknown
speaker
if
any
person
shall
kindle
the
fire
on
his
own
land
to
rely
on
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
ferguson,
what
--
what
about
the
statement
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
page
107
of
your
record,
hence
the
government
is
merely
an
adjoining
landowner.
unknown
speaker
but
the
court
said
that
is
under
the
control
of
the
railroad.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
--
am
i
right
about
this,
there's
a
washington
statute
that
says
where
the
dominant
tenant
has
been
actively
looking
after
it
then
the
servient
tenant
is
excused?
unknown
speaker
holdings
of
that.
unknown
speaker
but
it
--
it's
particularly
the
sentence
that
i
have
read
that
the
government
is
merely
an
adjoining
landowner.
unknown
speaker
which
would
take
them
out
from
under
the
statutes,
i
take
it,
that
you
(voice
overlap)
--
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
--
if
the
law
is
that
you
have
to
put
out
all
fires
on
your
property,
that's
a
different
thing
for
putting
out
only
those
fires
that
you
yourself
start
up.
unknown
speaker
well
then,
why
--
why
did
they
use
--
what's
your
explanation
to
the
use
of
that
sense
by
the
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
did
--
was
it
necessary
to
allege
that
in
order
to
have
a
cause
of
action?
the
reason
i
am
asking
because
in
the
first
statute
cited
by
your
opponent,
every
person
who
shall
willfully
or
negligently
set
are
failed
to
carefully
guard
or
extinguish
any
fire
on
his
own
land.
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
--
while
you're
talking
about
it,
that
is
in
section
13
of
the
complaint.
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
might
be
an
allegation
that
it
would
be
covered
by
that.
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
the
railroad's
right
of
way
to
the
plaintiff's?
unknown
speaker
it
didn't
go
up
to
the
railroad
right
of
way
to
the
government's
property,
it
did
that,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
--
i
may
say
they
all
seem
to
be
about
applicable
to
be
except
the
first
one.
unknown
speaker
it
is
section
2523.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
that's
the
court
of
appeals'
(inaudible)
to
that.
unknown
speaker
in
the
previous
case
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
yes,
why
don't
you
discuss
the
statutes?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
may
i
add
to
that
on
page
107
of
your
record,
your
case.
unknown
speaker
about
halfway
down
the
page,
hence
the
government
was
merely
an
adjoining
landowner,
and
that
a
fire
started
by
another,
subject
to
the
spread,
and
have
no
duty
to
follow
the
fire.
well
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
have
said
in
your
case.
unknown
speaker
now,
is
that
right
or
wrong
and
what
cases
support
or
attack?
unknown
speaker
the
chief
justice
(inaudible)
