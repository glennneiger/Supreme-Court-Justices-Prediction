justice

they
say
it
made
some
preliminary
conclusions
under
state
law.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
if
the
conclusions
had
been
different
as
to
the
duty
of
the
united
states
under
a
state
law
by
--
the
forest
service,
liability
might
have
been
predicated
without
getting
into
the
dalehite
problem
at
all,
might
it
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
--
before
you
leave
that
subject
in
amplifying
what
has
just
been
suggested
and
what
i
intended
to
raise
from
my
earlier
question
from
your
adversary.
this
is
a
thing
that
puzzles
me
a
little
bit.
if
this
fire
started
on
the
so-called
railroad
portion,
the
railroad
easement
by
sparks
flying
over
into
the
government
land,
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
right.
and
one
of
the
counts
of
negligence
was
that
the
government
was
responsible
from
the
emission
of
those
sparks
from
the
so-called
easement
part
of
the
land.
justice
john
m.
harlan
form
the
locomotive
stocks.
and
the
lower
court
of
the
--
the
lower
court
held
that
as
a
matter
of
washington
law,
the
united
states
would
not
be
responsible
for
the
--
what
happened
on
the
railroad
tracks
because
the
railroad
had
an
easement
that
under
washington
law,
united
--
the
government
would
not
be
liable,
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
here's
--
here's
what
puzzle
me
about
it.
when
i
came
to
the
briefs
in
the
case
that's
following
you,
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
was
a
great
question
of
facts
as
to
what
the
precise
relationship
was
between
the
united
states
and
the
railroad.
because
your
brief
as
does
the
brief
of
your
adversaries
and
particularly
in
the
other
case,
their
reply
brief
refers
to
a
lot
of
very
long
--
a
long
series
of
transactions
or
rather
complicated
series
of
transactions,
none
of
them
where
in
record
here.
there
are
matters
of
record
apparently
in
the
files
but
it
occurred
to
me
that
before
you
reach
--
before
you
can
say
that
the
lower
court
was
right
as
to
washington
law
in
relation
to
the
duty
of
the
united
states
to
this
easement,
there
was
a
question
of
fact
as
to
whether
or
not
the
relationship
was
that
--
of
the
united
states,
was
that
of
--
of
a
grantor
of
an
easement
and
there
was
a
question
of
fact
that
is
out
there.
now,
that's
my
problem
in
a
nutshell.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
just
to
that
point
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
what
you're
really
saying
is
there's
an
issue
of
fact
between
you
and
the
government
as
to
what
the
nature
of
this
relationship
was?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
therefore
the
--
until
that
issue
of
fact
is
predicated,
the
question
of
what
the
washington
--
is
established,
is
cited,
you
can't
tell
what
the
question
is
that
isn't
--
arise
under
washington
law.
justice
john
m.
harlan
which
you
denied.
