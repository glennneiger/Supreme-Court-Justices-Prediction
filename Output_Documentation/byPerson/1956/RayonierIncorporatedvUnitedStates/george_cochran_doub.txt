mr.
george
cochran
doub
if
the
court
please.
the
fire
fighting
on
private
lands
is
explicitly
authorized
by
federal
statute.
and
the
reports
of
the
department
of
agriculture
show
that
the
forest
service
is
fighting
--
has
been
fighting
30
--
between
10,000
and
11,000
independent
and
separate
fires
a
year.
the
daily
average
is
30.
and
on
the
basis
of
that,
there
are
30
fires
being
fought
today.
now,
if
the
court
please,
this
case
presents
clearly
for
a
decision,
the
major
question
whether
the
traditional
immunity
of
public
fireman
should
be
applied
to
the
forest
service
of
the
united
states
which
is
in
--
in
fighting
fires
on
public
and
private
lands.
now,
you'll
find
on
page
35,
in
paragraph
35
of
rayonier's
complaint
and
that's
page
26
of
the
record.
there
are
15
specifications
of
negligence
and
of
these
13
alleged
negligence
by
the
forest
service
in
fighting
this
fire.
so
this
is
a
question
of
national
importance
and
it's
raised
for
the
first
time
here
under
the
tort
claims
act.
now,
the
remaining
questions,
if
the
court
please,
as
to
the
possible
liability
of
the
united
states
as
an
owner
of
forest
land
in
permitting
its
property
to
be
substandard
conditions
that
is
not
within
the
public
fireman
immunity
principle.
it
involves
merely
the
interpretation
of
local
state
laws
applied
to
private
property
owners
and
--
so
the
major
issue
here
and
the
issue
that
is
a
particular
concerned
to
the
government
is
the
--
whether
dalehite
and
the
immunity
principle
established
as
to
the
coast
guard
there
shall
be
applied
to
the
forest
service
--

mr.

this
question
is

under
this
pleading.
mr.

it's

it's
unavoidable
and
it
should

so
construed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.

the
locomotive
stock?
mr.
george
cochran

yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
cochran

well
--
well,
your
honor,
the
--
the
briefs
here,
particularly
in
the
reply
brief
was
on
hold,
has
raised
that
question
emphatically,
but
i
should
like
to
point
this
out.
that
the
court
of
appeals
construed
the
allegations
of
this
complaint
and
the
representations
of
counsel
made
in
their
briefs
and
argument
its
meaning
that
the
railroad
had
a
railroad
easement
over
the
government
lands.
as
the
railroad
will
--
on
the
dominant
state
and
the
position
of
the
government
was
that
--
of
the
holder
of
a
servient
interstate.
now,
the
main
thrust
of
the
--
of
the
arguments
in
the
main
briefs
of
the
appellants,
both
arnhold
and
rayonier
presupposed
that
to
be
the
fact.
and
i
might
say
that
no
where
in
this
amended
complaints
that
arnhold
file
--
filed
four
of
them
did
they
ever
say
the
railroad
operated
a
locomotive
on
tracks
over
the
public
domain.
they
alleged
throughout.
they
--
they
refer
throughout
their
pleadings
to
a
railroad
right
of
way
which
in
all
the
dictionaries
is
deemed
equivalent
to
a
railroad
easement.
now
having
alleged
there
was
right
of
way
of
the
railroad
across
the
government
property
they
--
they
now
submit
that
perhaps
that
that's
wrong.
now,
they
did
--
they
did
query
it
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
main
thrust
to
their
argument
there,
in
their
briefs
and
argument
and
as
it
is
here
was
that
this
was
--
certainly,
it
was
a
railroad
easement
of
right
of
way,
one
of
the
effects
of
that.
now
obviously,
this
court
didn't
take
jurisdiction
of
these
cases
to
pass
on
such
a
question
as
that.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
your
honor,
let
me
go
on
with
my
argument
and
perhaps
i'll
be
clear
in
argument
than
in
the
brief.
i
hope
so.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
i
would
try
to
be.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
but
to
conclude
justice
harlan
on
that
point,
we
say
you
should
take
this
case
as
the
court
of
appeals
construed
the
pleadings
and
as
they
interpreted
the
washington
law.
in
accordance
with
your
established
policy
which
you
would
had
to
in
numerous
cases
of
--
of
saying
that
decision
of
the
--
of
the
circuit
judges
particularly
as
in
this
case
were
one
of
those
circuit
judges
practiced
for
40
years
in
the
state
of
washington,
judge
boldt,
you
should
accept
that.
now,
the
allegations
of
negligence
here
are
--
are
of
importance.
all
of
the
negligent
acts
imputed
to
the
forest
service
relate
to
the
quantum
of
effort
in
fighting
a
fire.
they
are
all
negative
acts
of
nonfeasance.
there
are
no
affirmative
acts
at
all.
they
are
not
even
acts
as
alleged
negligence
in
getting
equipment
to
the
scene
of
the
fire
or
taking
up
fire
truck
or
a
fire
automobile
having
an
access
on
the
way.
the
allegations
are
that
the
forest
service,
although
they
conceive
we
put
out
five
of
these
fires,
they
say
the
sixth
fire
got
away
from
us.
and
we
didn't
use
enough
water
and
enough
equipment
and
enough
men
to
extinguish
that
fire
before
it
leaves
the
plaintiff's
property.
now,
i'd
like
to
point
out,
your
honors,
that
this
is
the
bedrock
of
the
immunity,
public
fireman
doctrine.
in
other
words,
there
has
been
a
distortion
of
that
immunity
in
many
state
cases.
i
think
it's
been
applied
too
far.
it's
been
applied
to
some
cases
to
the
negligent
operation
of
a
fire
truck
on
the
way
to
the
scene
of
a
fire,
but
we
are
not
dealing
with
that.
we're
dealing
with
the
quantum
of
effort
which
we
say
should
be
clearly
covered,
and
why?
because
in
the
case
of
every
fire,
it
can
be
charged
if
you
use
10
men,
you
should
have
used
20
men.
if
you
use
50
men,
you
should
have
been
--
used
a
100
men.
and
it
is
true
that
if
we
used
more
men
and
used
more
water
and
used
more
supplies,
that
fire
would
have
been
put
out
sooner.
so,
liability
here
on
the
ground
that
the
immunity
principle
is
inapplicable
would
mean
litigation
we
think
in
the
case
of
every
fire
that
these
people
are
fighting
daily.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
i
--
i
was
generalizing,
your
honor,
that
that's
true
in
any
fire.
all
--
in
any
fire
if
you
use
more
men
and
water
--
mr.
george

if
you're

mr.
george

i

talking
about
this
specific
fire,
your
honor.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no,
i
was
theorizing.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
that
--
that
the
charge
that's
made
here
is
the
charge
that
can
be
made
in
the
10,000
fires
a
year
that
we
fight.
mr.
george
cochran

that's
right.
mr.
george

yes.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
if
there's
no
immunity
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
--
on
as
such
a
duty.
it
would
mean
that
we're
--
we're
going
to
have
litigation
and
a
review
by
a
court
in
the
case
of
each
of
these
fires.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
i
think
it's
clearly
defined.
now,
there's
an
aspect
of
it
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
mentioned
at
the
end,
it
may
not
be
reached.
and
i'm
coming
to
that
in
just
a
moment.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
[laughs]
--
the
appellant
contends
the
forest
service
should
be
denied
this
public
fireman
immunity
principle
upon
the
following
grounds.
there
are
five.
first,
the
forest
service
is
primarily
a
caretaker
of
timberlands
of
the
government.
secondly,
the
forest
service
has
many
other
extensive
duties
than
fire
fighting.
three,
they
refer
to
a
cooperative
agreement
in
their
brief.
and
four,
the
government
was
under
a
special
statutory
or
common
law
duty
under
washington
law
to
fight
fires.
and
five,
they
say
indian
towing
company
should
be
treated
as
overruling
dalehite.
i
like
to
just
say
a
few
words
on
each
of
this.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no
--
no
--
no
your
honor.
that's
not
involved
here.
i
was
emphasizing
that
all
these
allegations
of
negligence
about
fire
fighting
in
these
complaints
go
to
the
quantum
of
effort.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
and
they
--
and
they
--
they
are
--
it
is
nonfeasance
and
there
--
there
is
no
affirmative
acts.
now,
i
recognized
that
you
can
have
in
some
cases
an
act
of
nonfeasance
can
be
just
dangerous
as
an
affirmative
act
of
negligence.
but
it's
not
just
nonfeasance.
it
relates
to
the
quantum
of
effort.
and
we
say
that
that
is
the
hardcore
of
the
immunity
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
they
don't
define
what
the
plan
is,
your
honor.
so,
they
don't
even
define
what
the
plan
is
and
i
don't
--
as
i
recall,
they're
maybe
mistaken.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
i
don't
--
i
don't
believe
it
does
there,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
if
it
comes
down
to
the
fact
that
they
--
that
as
described
by
mr.
marion
that
everybody
had
list
of
people
that
were
in
the
area
working
and
where
they
could
be
reached
and
--
and
what
his
point
is,
if
we
didn't
call
enough
men
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
--
because
of
the
fire
--
mr.
george
cochran

we
call
the
men

mr.

any
event

mr.

mr.

well,
i
will

mr.
george

doub
your
honor,
we
say
that
and
we're
still
entitled
to
the
immunity
of
public
firemen
if
it's
applied.
the
whole
question
is
does
the
immunity
apply?
and
that's
what
i'm
directing
my
remarks
to.
of
course
if
it
doesn't
apply,
they
stated
the
case
of
negligence.
mr.
george
cochran

yes,
i
know.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes.
i
would
say
the
proper
scope
of
the
immunity
principle
would
protect
the
government
from
any
charges
and
negligence
as
to
its
fire
fighting
activities.
allegations
we
fail
to
put
plans
and
operation,
we
failed
to
use
some
other
plans.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
that's
right.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
that's
right.
and
we
rely
on
the
traditional
law
of
--
of
all
the
states
of
this
country
and
participated
in
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
i
think
so,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
oh,
now,
except
one,
and
then
the
others
that
occurred,
your
honor.
but
my
impression
is
that
it
is
the
established
law
in
this
country
and
municipality
shall
not
be
held
liable
for
fire
fighting
that
they
shall
be
deemed
in
the
operations
of
their
fire
departments
and
their
efforts
to
suppress,
discourage,
immune
from
liability.
and
the
basis
of
the
reasoning
was
stated
extremely
well
in
dalehite
where
--
where
you
sounded
up
and
that
you
would
not
stating
anything
new,
but
the
court
was
stating
what
have
been
said
time
and
time
again.
in
dalehite,
you
said
the
act
did
not
create
new
causes
of
action
where
none
existed
before.
it
did
not
change
the
normal
rule
that
an
alleged
failure
of
carelessness
of
public
fireman
does
not
create
private
actionable
rights.
and
we
went
on
to
say
to
impose
liability
for
the
alleged
nonfeasance
of
the
coast
guard
would
be
like
holding
the
united
states
liable
in
tort
for
failure
to
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
this
is
the
first
time
that
a
case
has
come
up
involving
forest
fire.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no
--
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
it
has
and
knowing
it
has,
the
theory
of
those
cases
was

(inaudible)

authorize

department
of
agriculture
which
comprehends
the
prior
service
to
enter
into
cooperative
agreements
with
the
states
providing
for
fire
protection.
these
complaints
allege
that
this
area
involved
here
was
covered
by
such
a
cooperative
agreement
to
claim
the
united
states
and
the
state
of
washington
under
which
pursuant
to
this
federal
act,
the
united
states
agreed
to
provide
fire
protection
for
all
state
and
private
lands
within
the
area.
i
emphasize
that
for
two
reasons,
one,
it
manifest
that
the
united
states
was
not
acting
here
merely
as
a
private
property
owner,
harvesting
timber
for
profit
as
in
the
case
of
these
plaintiffs.
it
was
administering
and
acting
in
fighting
this
fire
under
the
authority
of
the
state
of
washington
as
well
as
this
federal
act
which
authorize
it.
and
the
--
this
cooperative
agreement
which
is
referred
to
in
the
complaint
and
which
we
filed
with
the
clerk,
explicitly
provides
that
the
personnel
of
the
fire
service
are
--
are
clothed
with
the
duties
and
privileges
of
state
forest
wardens.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
i
don't
have
it
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
--
in
front
of
me,
your
honor,
but
i
think
it's
only
a
page
or
two
and
i
think
its
right
on
the
first
page.
it
--
so
we
were
acting
in
a
dual
capacity
in
fighting
these
fires,
both
as
federal
officers
and
as
state
officers.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes,
it
was
and
it's
alleged
in
the
complaints
that
it
was.
now,
i
might
say
that
you
will
find
that
that
agreement,
that
cooperative
agreement
provides
on
--
in
paragraph
13,
"the
united
states
shall
not
be
liable
for
any
damage
incident
to
cooperation
hereunder."
so
the
government
attempted
to
make
it
clear
in
its
agreement
with
the
state
of
washington
that
it
was
not
losing
its
traditional
immunity.
i
think
the
only
significance
of
that
cooperative
agreement
is
that
it
shows
that
the
federal
service
was
acting
under
the
authority
of
the
state
of
washington
and
not
merely
as
a
volunteer.
another
point
made
by
the
appellants
is
that
we're
not
a
public
fireman
because
the
fire
service
had
many
other
extensive
duties
other
than
firefighting.
well,
that
i
submit
was
disposed
of
dalehite
because
the
coast
guard
had
many
duties
other
than
firefighting.
firefighting
was
actually
one
of
the
most
insignificant
functions
of
the
coast
guard,
shipboard
firefighting,
whereas
in
our
case,
it's
a
primary
function
of
the
fire
service.
yes,
it
has
other
duties
but
it's
certainly
far
more
of
a
major
function
than
--
than
that
of
the
coast
guard.
so
we
say
the
quantum
of
effort
directed
to
firefighting
is
too
artificial
a
standard
to
be
used
for
the
definition
of
what
is
a
public
fireman.
now,
that
brings
me
to
the
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
that's
right.
in
other
words,
it
made
it
clear
that
it
was
not
creating
any
new
rights
but
it
wasn't
eliminating
any
existing
rights
that
anyone
might
have.
i
think
the
first
part
of
it,
your
honor,
relates
to
a
washington
statute
permitting
the
recovery
of
cause
in
fighting
fires
against
the
private
owner
when
he
doesn't
do
it
and
the
forest
service
of
the
state
of
washington
has
--
state
wardens
have
to
come
in
and
do
it
themselves.
that's
of
course
inapplicable.
the
latter
part
of
it,
we
think
obviously,
is
referring
to
the
obligations
of
private
property
owners
and
not
the
obligations
of
either
the
state
or
the
united
states.
now,
was
the
government,
as
the
property
owner,
under
any
special
or
common
law
duty
under
local
washington
law
to
fight
fires
which
might
be
deemed
to
destroy
our
firefighting
immunity
from
liability?
now,
i'd
like
to
point
out
this
difficulty
of
attempting
to
subject
the
united
states
to
such
a
duty
to
fight
fires
under
local
law,
which
may
vary
from
--
in
each
of
the
states.
the
fire
service
is
not
fighting
fires
because
of
local
law.
if
local
law
makes
a
--
a
private
property
owner
and
insurer,
a
guarantor,
the
quantum
of
our
effort
would
be
the
same
in
that
state,
as
it
would
be
in
a
state
where
there's
no
liability
at
all.
in
other
words,
we're
dealing
here
with
a
national
organization
operating
under
federal
authority
to
preserve
this
great
national
treasure
for
the
benefit
of
the
people
of
the
united
states.
we're
not
acting
by
a
virtue
of
whether
or
not
some
individual
state
might
have
a
firefighting
law
applicable
to
private
property
owners.
our
position
is
entirely
different,
if
the
court
please.
we
are
actually
administering
these
enclaves
of
federal
jurisdiction.
we
are
--
we
are
applying
and
enforcing
state
and
federal
laws
in
this
forest.
our
--
the
idea
of
these
appellants
and
we're
just
another
timber
operator
harvesting
timber
for
profit
as
they
are
and
subject
to
the
same
duties
under
state
law.
we
say
just
it
--
it
cannot
be
sound
and
so
we
say
immunity
here.
we
either
--
should
be
determine
applying
national
basis
that
fire
service
in
fighting
fires
should
be
deemed
to
be
public
fireman
and
entitled
to
immunity
of
such
in
their
firefighting
activities
or
it
should
not.
but
--
but
the
determination
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
now
--
now,
that
--
that
comes
to
--
that's
on
the
other
aspect
of
the
case,
your
honor,
whether
we
--
whether
we
permitted
a
fire
hazard
on
our
property.
i
haven't
reached
that
point.
i'm
merely
talking
now
on
the
first
aspect
of
the
case
that
is
whether
the
immunity
of
public
fireman
should
be
denied
the
fire
service
as
to
fighting
fires
or
negligence
in
fighting
fires
or
the
failure
to
fight
fires
as
aggressively
as
some
plaintiff
says,
we
should
and
stood
by
and
did
nothing
to
stop
the
fire
and
just
relied
on
the
united
states
to
put
it
out
before
it
got
to
their
property
as
these
plaintiffs
apparently
did.
i
say
that
our
--
that
immunity
which
you
must
determine
whether
it
applies
or
does
not
apply
is
a
much
more
comprehensive,
broader
policy
than
having
its
--
it
depend
merely
upon
whether
there
is
a
state
statute
imposing
the
duty
upon
private
landowners
to
fight
fires
vigorously,
as
there
was
in
the
state
of
washington.
now,
because
we're
not
fighting
fires
because
of
that
local
--
there's
a
local
statute
somewhere
and
if,
as
i
said
before,
we're
going
to
fight
fires
in
the
state
where
there
isn't
any
statute
at
all
and
there's
no
obligation
on
private
property
owners
to
do
it,
just
as
vigorously
as
we
would
in
a
state
that
makes
the
private
property
owner
a
guarantor.
well,
i
see
my
time
is
--
did
my
time
expire
now?
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes,
sir.
i
suppose.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
your
honor,
my
answer
to
that
is
this
that
as
the
allegations
of
this
complaint
have
been
interpreted
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
as
the
washington
law
has
been
interpreted
by
the
court
of
appeals,
this
would
not
state
a
complaint
against
a
private
person
--
i
mean
a
valid
cause
of
action.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
if
the
court
please,
arnhold
filed
in
the
district
court
four
complaints.
now,
the
fourth
amended
complaint
which
is
the
one
before
your
honors,
which
may
--
we
may
assume
did
not
understate
this
plaintiff's
claim,
states
at
page
6
of
the
record.
and
this
is
the
only
sentence
about
the
origin
of
this
fire,
the
last
sentence
on
the
page,
“that
said
train
threw
sparks
and
fire
into
the
dried
grass,
combustible
herbage,
and
rotten
tires
both
in
and
near
the
tracks
causing
the
same
to
become
ignited
in
at
least
six
places
in
a
distance
of
three
miles.”
now,
if
you
look
at
the
proceeding
paragraph,
they
described
the
railroad
operation
on
its
right
of
way.
they
described
the
rotten
tires
allowing
the
road
bed
and
quantities
of
dried
grass
and
combustible
herbage
present
on
the
right
of
way
and
between
the
tracks.
and
then
they
say
then
at
the
bottom,
that
the
train
threw
sparks
and
fire
into
the
dried
grass,
combustible
herbage,
and
rotten
tires
both
in
and
near
the
tracks.
now
your
honor,
that
was
construed
by
the
court
of
appeals
as
meaning
the
fire
started
on
the
right
of
way.
but
i
make
that
logical
and
reasonable
deduction,
if
these
plaintiffs
wanted
to
allege
that
this
fire
started
on
our
adjoining
public
property,
all
they
had
to
do
is
say
so.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
i'm
going
to
talk
about
those
statutes
right
now,
your
honor,
but
let
me
generalize
a
lot
of
things.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
first
we
say
that
they
have
made
out
a
factual
situation
here
where
the
fire
started
on
the
right
of
way
then
spread
to
the
public
domain,
then
spread
to
a
1600-acre
track
of
private
property,
and
then
on
to
the
private
property.
now,
the
--
we
--
we
interpret
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
it
did,
yes
--
yes,
the
government
owned
the
adjoining
property,
if
the
court
please.
now,
we've
been
unable
to
find
any
decision
in
the
state
of
washington
holding
that
if
a
fire
originates
off
your
property,
and
then
goes
on
to
your
property,
that
that
property
owner
is
under
a
duty
to
suppress
it
or
is
responsible
for
the
condition
of
his
property.
in
other
words,
you'll
find
that
this
washington
cases
so
far
perhaps
they
will
go
that
far
in
the
future.
but
so
far
you'll
find
that
each
one
deals
with
the
situation
where
a
property
originated
on
the
property
of
the
defendant.
the
fire
originated
there.
he
either
set
it,
kindled
it
or
somebody
else
kindled
it
on
alleged
combustible
condition
that
had
been
permitted
to
exist.
now,
let
me
deal
with
these
statutes.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
the
first
one
in
my
notes
your
honor
is
section
5647.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well
first
let
me
dispose
the
5647
because
that
is
the
only
statute
of
the
state
of
washington
explicitly
providing
for
civil
liability
and
damages
with
respect
to
fire
hazards.
that's
--
do
you
find
that
at
page
79
of
our
brief
your
honor?
mr.
george
cochran
doub
and
that
statute
only
applies
by
its
terms
where
a
person
kindles
a
fire
upon
his
own
land.
and
that
of
course
is
defined
in
the
dictionaries
as
meaning
setting
on
fire,
igniting
and
lighting
the
fire,
so
we
are
not
under
that
statute
because
conceitedly
this
fire
was
started
by
an
independent
railroad.
now
at
section
58
(1)
(a)
which
is
at
page
81
of
our
brief
doesn't
provide
for
a
civil
remedy.
it
--
it
refers
--
it
says
that
forests
shall
be
protected
and
preserved
from
fire
hazard
caused
by
reason
of
the
unusual
quantity
of
falling
timber
upon
such
land.
well,
that
there's
no
charge
as
to
that.
then
it
says
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
to
do
any
act
which
shall
expose
any
of
the
forest
or
timber
upon
such
land
to
the
hazard
of
fire.
well,
we
construe
that
is
referring
to
an
affirmative
act
of
negligence.
and
there's
no
affirmative
act
of
negligence
here.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
these
complaints
don't
even
allege
that
the
united
states
created
any
of
these
conditions
about
which
they
complained
at
all.
we
didn't
--
they
don't
say
we
left
slashings
there,
or
cut
the
timber
and
that
we
left
tires
there.
then
section
5807,
and
that's
the
one
that
maybe
applicable,
provides
that
the
owner
of
any
land
on
the
state
covered
wholly
or
in
part
by
inflammable
debris
created
by
logging
or
other
forest
operations,
land
clearing
or
right
of
way
clearing
shall
abate
this
condition.
and
it
goes
on
to
provide
that
the
state
may
recover
its
cost,
if
the
owner
refuses
or
fails
to
do
it
after
notice,
and
the
state
has
to
do
it.
now
the
courts
of
washington
as
--
as
we
understand
it,
and
i
battle
with
deference
to
mr.
ferguson
because
he
is
from
there
and
i
know
he
knows
it
greatly
and
more
about
it
than
i
do
but
as
we
follow
these
cases,
we
can't
find
the
courts
of
washington
have
ever
held
that
this
sections
even
create
a
civil
remedy
in
damages
for
a
violation.
when
washington
wanted
to
create
a
civil
remedy
in
damages,
it
said
so.
and
that
and
it
did
so
explicitly
on
the
first
statute
i
referred
to.
and
these
next
succeeding
ones
provide
for
a
different
type
of
sanction,
and
that
sanction
as
a
recovery
of
the
state's
cost.
but
in
any
event,
your
honor,
we
say
this,
the
court
of
appeals
has
construed
these
statutes
and
they've
construed
them
as
being
inapplicable.
and
we
submit
that
this
court
shouldn't
be
attempting
to
construe
the
state
law
of
washington.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
perhaps
--
perhaps
you
can
take
it
off
on
that
ground
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
i
hate
to
have
a
look
and
justice
frankfurter
to
acquiesce
in
that
because
the
government
is
anxious
to
obtain
a
determination
on
this
question
of
major
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
they
have
major
consequence
and
that
is
the
immunity
of
fire
fighting
principle.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes.
i
think
the
fire
fighting
immunity
doctrine
is
a
question
of
--
except
for
one
angle
to
it,
it's
a
question
of
interpretation
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
now
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
that's
right.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
but
your
honor,
i
--
i
think
the
case
could
go
off
on
the
ground
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes,
your
honor,
and
--
and
the
case
could
go
on
as
justice
frankfurter
suggested
on
the
ground
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
which
contains
judge
bone
and
who
was
a
40-year
practitioner
from
the
state
of
washington.
they
have
construed
these
statutes
and
they
have
held
that
under
these
particular
circumstances,
a
private
landowner
would
not
be
liable
and
that
you
--
you
have
to
have
a
traditional
policy
of
refusing
to
attempt
to
establish
or
create
law
for
a
state
because
after
all
it's
not
binding
on
the
state.
the
court
of
appeals
of
washington
might
not
follow
your
speculation
as
to
what
it
might
be.
and
you
have
no
decision
in
washington
that
is
directly
applicable
here
to
this
situation.
it
may
be
they
would
hold
the
united
states
if
--
where
a
private
person
liable
under
these
conditions
but
they
have
never
done
so,
so
far.
restricted
the
civil
liability
in
damages
to
a
situation
where
the
fire
originated
on
the
property
of
the
defendant.
and
they
have
never
held
that
it
would
apply
otherwise.
if
i
have
a
moment,
i
would
like
to
make
a
one
or
two
reflections
that
may
not
be
pertinent
on
the
good
samaritan
doctrine
because
it's
of
some
interest
and
it's
almost
analogous
here.
you
talk
a
good
deal
about
it
or
it
was
there
at
least
referred
to
in
the
indian
towing
company
case.
you
remember
the
idea
and
notion
of
the
good
samaritan
doctrine
is
that
assuming
there's
no
obligation
on
your
part
to
act,
to
rescue
another.
if
you
do
act,
you're
under
a
duty
to
exercise
reasonable
care.
now,
that
samaritan
doctrine
is
then
a
formative
state,
it's
not
even
mentioned
in
the
restatement
on
the
law
of
torts.
it
was
originated
and
as
i
recall
it,
by
justice
cardozo,
when
he
was
on
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
and
it's
been
referred
to
by
this
court.
if
it
means
that
when
the
samaritan
acts
to
effect
to
rescue,
he
is
liable
if
he
doesn't
act
strenuously
enough,
if
he
doesn't
call
for
additional
assistance
louder,
if
he
gives
up
as
he
swims
and
decides
he
can't
make
it,
that
he
should
have
gone
on.
i
say
that's
a
very
cynical
doctrine.
and
i
think
because
it
penalizes
voluntary
gratuitous
efforts
which
improper.
if
it
means
that
the
samaritan
is
driving
some
--
a
victim
or
somebody
he
has
rescued
to
a
hospital
and
he
goes
through
a
red
light
or
negligently
operates
his
car
with
the
result
that
that
person
is
injured
or
another,
of
course
he
is
liable.
but
i
say
that
this
--
this
doctrine
requires
a
far
more
consideration
and
definition
than
it's
been
given
it.
i
think
it
could
be
a
very
dangerous
cynical
doctrine.
we
submit,
if
the
court
please,
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
