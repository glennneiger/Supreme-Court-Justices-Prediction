justice
felix
frankfurter
will
you
be
good
enough
to
refer
me
to
the
record
in
when
the
court
gave
any
--
made
any
comment
on
his
ruling?
where
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'll
take
time
if
you
can't
let
it
through.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
--
don't
bother.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
all
there
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
the
light
we
have
on
his
--
the
workings
of
his
mind?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
what
--
what,
would
you
mind,
he
could
have
been
--
perhaps
you
can
state
or
restate
exactly
what
your
proposition
at
law
is
that
this
is
not
a
matter
of
discretion
all
that
in
this
case
the
--
the
exercise
is
--
of
abuse?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
but
where
it
isn't
that
there
is
no
discretion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
isn't
at
realm
of
discretion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
if
--
is
it
that
the
testimony
is
serious
or
(inaudible)
the
questions
this
would
--
making
a
damaging
statement,
having
previously
testified
we
have
a
right
to
find
out
whether
he's
consistent
with
his
charge
or
whether
he
taper
down
or
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
damaging.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
because
--
because
he
testified
before
the
grand
jury?
suppose
--
suppose
it
has
come
to
your
knowledge
that
he
made
a
difference,
that
he
made
a
statement
that
he
presumably
did,
would
the
u.s.
attorney
or
district
u.s.
attorney
can
you
call
for
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
if
you
say
you
agreed
to
believe
as
--
as
a
careful
lawyer
a
minute
was
made
with
that
conversation.
i
--
i
just
want
to
know
what
the
process
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
government
resist
it
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
record
--
was
the
record
left
in
an
unsatisfactory
condition
on
the
point
just
brought
out
by
justice
douglas
that
the
government's
objection
was
inconvenient
or
inaccessibility?
and
was
there
any
--
anything
made
of
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
in
the
course
of
trial,
we
can
go
on
and
then
bring
it
in
later?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
you
said
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
little
--
one
of
few
lines
below,
mr.
parsons
to
the
court
said
they
never
had
it
but
then
they
do
not
know
they
have
it
here.
mr.
parsons,
"no,
he
did
not
see
it
either
and
i,
myself,
never
saw
it."
who
is
the
"he"?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
we
can't
really
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
clock
or
period
of
time
in
which
specific
provisions
of
a
single
act
was
passed
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
say
that
one
is
made
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
abt
didn't,
unless
i
didn't
hear
him,
make
much
of
any
--
the
alleged
error
in
the
charge
and
in
his
brief
that's
on
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
didn't'
mean
to
suggest
that.
i
--
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
that.
no
lawyer
abandons
anything
that's
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
that's
why
the
u.s.
attorney
would
say
we
are
delighted
with
this
report.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
