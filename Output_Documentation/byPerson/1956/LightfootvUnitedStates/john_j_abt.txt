mr.

abt
thank
you,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case,
like
the
one
that
you
have
just
heard,
involves
a
conviction
under
the
membership
clause
of
the
smith
act.
the
indictments
in
the
two
cases
are
identical
except
for
the
names
of
the
defendants
and
allegations
as
to
venue.
the
trial
here,
which
was
the
first
trial
under
the
membership
clause,
preceded
that
by
--
in
scales
by
some
three
months.
the
indictment,
i
may
say,
was
returned
in
may
of
1954.
petitioner
was
sentenced
to
a
$5000
fine
and
a
five-year
prison
sentence,
and
the
conviction
was
affirmed
in
the
seventh
circuit.
this
case,
like
scales,
raises
questions
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
membership
clause
on
its
face
and
the
effect
of
section
4
(f)
of
the
internal
security
act
as
a
bar
to
the
indictment.
i
shall
have
something
to
add
to
what
has
already
been
said
on
those
questions
a
little
later.
but
i
first
want
to
discuss
our
contention
that
the
record
in
this
case
required
a
judgement
of
acquittal.
important
questions
concerning
the
evidence
necessary
to
sustain
a
smith
act
conviction
had
been
argued
in
the
yates
or
submitted
in
the
yates
and
scales
cases.
i
believe,
however,
that
this
record
presents
in
the
sharpest
and
most
extreme
form
the
question
as
to
whether
a
communist
defendant
in
a
smith
act
case
is
to
be
entitled
to
the
long
accepted
and
constitutionally
protected
standards
governing
proof
of
guilt.
before
i
come
to
the
facts,
i
should
like
to
make
two
preliminary
observations.
first,
in
contradistinction
to
the
yates
case,
the
testimony
here,
fortunately,
occupies
less
than
500
pages
of
the
record
and
indeed,
the
disputed
questions
of
fact
--
as
i
think
they
appear
from
our
brief
and
the
respondent's
brief,
relate
to,
perhaps,
four
matters
involving
no
more
than
a
dozen
pages
of
the
record.
second,
during
the
argument
in
yates,
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
this
question.
if
the
communist
party
had
been
the
defendant,
would
there
have
been
enough
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury
on
the
question
of
its
advocacy
of
prescribed
doctrine?
the
answer
to
that
question,
mr.
justice
harlan,
in
this
case
is
a
clear
unqualified
and
unequivocal
no.
this
for
the
reason
among
others,
that
the
only
witness
for
the
prosecution
on
that
branch
of
the
case
testified
that
the
advocacy
of
the
organization
was
peaceable.
i
shall
return
to
that
point
later.
at
the
trial,
the
petitioner
acknowledged
that
he
had
been
a
member
and
officer
of
the
communist
party
for
many
years.
he
had
held
various
offices
in
the
illinois
organization
and,
at
the
time
of
the
indictment,
was
also
an
alternate
member
of
the
national
committee
of
the
national
organization.
thus,
the
issues
of
fact
were
confined
to
his
knowledge
and
intent.
first,
during
a
three-year
statutory
period
did
he
know
the
communist
party
as
a
society
of
persons
who,
in
the
language
of
incitement,
advocated
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
as
soon
as
circumstances
would
permit.
and
second,
during
that
three-year
period
did
he
personally
have
the
specific
intent
to
bring
about
such
overthrow
as
soon
as
circumstances
would
permit.
and
may
i
say
parenthetically
here
to
dispose
of
that
question
at
once
the
medina
incitement
instruction
was
given
in
this
case.
the
prosecution
called
eight
witnesses
whose
testimony
was
material
and
offered
a
number
of
exhibits.
the
petitioner
called
no
witnesses
and
offered
but
one
exhibit.
all
of
the
prosecution
witnesses
were
former
members
of
the
communist
party.
five
had
been
fbi
informers
throughout
their
membership
and
the
sixth,
the
ubiquitous
lautner,
who,
i
believe,
has
been
a
prosecution
witness
in
every
smith
act
case
since
dennis,
was
a
full-time
department
of
justice
employee
at
the
time
he
testified.
the
evidence
on
the
crucial
issue
of
the
petitioner's
own
acts
and
declarations
spanned
19
years
of
his
life
and
membership
in
the
communist
party.
it
falls
into
four
categories,
his
attendance
and
speeches
at
communist
party
meetings,
private
conversations,
his
teaching
in
communist
party
schools
and
finally,
his
published
writings.
fbi
informers
testified
the
petitioner's
attendance
at
a
total
of
16
meetings
between
1945
and
1951
at
which
he
or
other
communists
spoke.
only
three
of
these
incidentally
occurred
during
a
three-year
statutory
period.
i
have
included
what
i
think
is
a
painstaking
summary
of
the
testimony
as
to
all
16
meetings
in
an
--
in
an
appendix
to
our
brief
the
accuracy
of
which
the
government
does
not
challenge.
if
this
testimony
is
accepted
in
its
entirety,
it
establishes
no
more
than
that
the
petitioner
or
other
speakers
called
for
the
building
of
a
communist
party
particularly
among
the
negro
people
and
working
people
urge
communists
to
work
more
effectively
in
trade
unions
and
veterans
organizations,
express
confidence
in
the
eventual
establishment
of
socialism
in
this
country,
praise
the
soviet
union
and
its
leaders,
oppose
the
cold
war
policies
of
the
truman
administration,
denounced
legislative
committees
investigating
communism
and
advise
communists
not
to
reveal
their
membership
publicly,
if
to
do
so
would
jeopardize
their
positions
in
the
community.
two
witnesses,
meyer
and
skinner,
who
incidentally
were
the
only
two
not
then
or
formerly
on
the
payroll
of
the
fbi,
testified
to
their
presence
at
or
participation
in
the
conversations
with
the
petitioner.
ms.
skinner
testified
that
in
the
years
1947-1948,
she
frequently
saw
petitioner
at
the
chicago
party
headquarters
where
he
talked
with
the
party
officials
there,
but
she
wasn't
asked
and
didn't
testify
about
the
content
of
any
of
these
conversations.
the
witness
meyer
knew
petitioner
intimately
and
worked
with
him
closely
in
the
communist
party
during
the
eight
years,
from
1934
to
1942.
they
had
innumerable
discussions
concerning
the
theoretical
and
practical
aspects
of
communist
party
work.
in
1940,
the
two
men
held
an
extended
discussion
of
the
courses
on
marxism-leninism,
which
petitioner
was
then
teaching.
they
went
over
the
books
by
marx,
engels,
lenin
and
stalin,
the
so-called
"classics"
that
petitioner
used
in
these
classes.
meyer
was
able
to
identify
the
specific
pages
of
these
books
which
they
had
discussed
some
14
or
15
years
previously.
he
testified
that
he
and
the
petitioner
reached
agreement
on
what
should
be
taught
and
how
it
should
be
taught.
but
the
prosecution
never
asked
him
what
that
agreement
was.
certainly,
if
the
petitioner
had
understood
the
communist
party
or
these
books
to
advocate
the
violent
overthrow
of
our
government,
he
would
have
said
so
in
the
course
of
these
lengthy
and
searching
conversations
with
meyer.
but
the
prosecution
sedulously
avoided
asking
meyer
what
was
said
and
the
witness
gave
no
testimony
whatsoever
concerning
the
subject
of
these
conversations
or
what
was
said
in
these
conversations.
two
witnesses,
meyer
and
ms.
skinner,
testified
that
they
had
attended
a
number
of
petitioner's
classes
of
principles
of
marxism-leninism,
but
they
weren't
asked
and
they
didn't
testify
as
to
what
petitioner
taught
them.
a
third
witness,
the
informer
brzek,
attended
two
of
petitioner's
lectures
at
a
school
held
in
1947,
eight
years
before
the
trial.
it
is
simply
impossible
to
paraphrase
the
witnesses'
incoherent
and
(inaudible)
of
account
of
what
petitioner
is
supposed
to
have
said.
i
quote
the
essence
of
our
--
of
his
testimony
at
page
10
of
our
brief
and
it
appears
in
full
at
record
460,
462.
i
invite
the
court
to
take
a
look
at
it.
brzek's
version
of
petitioner's
remark
is
studded
with
references
to
blood
and
bloodshed.
but
according
to
the
witness,
petitioner,
and
i
quote
him,
"went
on
to
explain
that
it
wouldn't
be
a
shooting,
it
would
be
more
quiet
methods
of
doing
that
blood,"
end
of
it.
now,
just
what
the
nature
of
this
more
quiet
method
of
doing
the
blood
end
of
it
was
was
never
elucidated
in
the
testimony.
brzek
also
testified
that
petitioner,
in
this
same
lecture,
repeatedly
emphasize,
and
i
quote
him,
"that
we
will
try
to
avoid
bloodshed
and
we
will
approach
it
to
avoid
bloodshed,"
and
then
concluded
his
lecture
with
this
statement,
"however,
we
will
not
be
pushed
off,
if
we
have
to
shed
blood,
we
will."
now,
i
submit,
at
the
very
most
that
can
be
spelled
out
of
this
confused
and
confusing
police
by
story
is
that
far
from
advocating
violence,
petitioner
urged
its
avoidance
and
that
most
warned
of
a
possible
reluctant
resort
to
force
at
some
time
in
the
future,
if
this
became
necessary
as
a
measure
of
self-defense.
i
should
add
that
the
witness,
ms.
skinner,
who
preceded
brzek
to
the
stand,
testified
that
she
attended
the
same
sessions
of
the
1947
school.
but
the
prosecution
carefully
refrained
from
asking
her
what
petitioner
had
taught
them.
now,
the
only
other
evidence
of
petitioner's
acts
and
declarations
consist
of
some
of
his
published
speeches
and
articles.
these
show
that
he
has
been
highly
critical
of
many
aspects
of
the
foreign
and
domestic
policies
of
the
national
administration,
his
expressed
admiration
of
the
soviet
union
and
its
leaders.
he
believes
in
the
ultimate
establishment
of
socialism
in
this
country.
and
he
is
very
deeply
concerned
by
the
discrimination
and
violence
practiced
against
his
people,
the
negro
people.
the
court
will
doubtless
find
many
of
his
ideas
distasteful
and
may
consider
some
of
his
language
intemperate.
but
it
will
find
that
the
articles
contain
no
discussion
whatsoever
of
the
means
for
bringing
about
socialism
in
the
united
states.
and
that
far
from
advocating
violence,
they
demonstrate
petitioner's
abhorrence
of
its
use
in
any
form
or
for
any
purpose.
petitioner's
writings
state
that
he
is
in
adherent
of
the
principles
of
marxism-leninism.
and
they
contain
the
only
evidence
in
the
entire
record
of
his
understanding
of
the
meaning
and
application
of
these
principles.
significantly,
the
petitioner
wrote,
and
i
quote
him,
"marxism-leninism
gives
us
the
power
of
orientation.
it
enables
us
to
perceive
the
direction
in
which
things
are
heading.
it
does
not
nor
can
it
determine
for
us
beforehand
the
form
nor
the
exact
time
of
a
new
social
development."
with
that,
i
have
now
summarized
all
of
the
evidence
concerning
petitioner's
acts
and
declarations.
respondent's
counter-statement
of
the
facts
in
the
main
confirms
the
accuracy
of
my
summary.
respondent,
however,
resorts
to
three
devices
in
an
attempt
to
squeeze
some
evidence
of
guilt
out
of
this
arid
record.
these
are
dealt
with
fully
in
my
reply
brief.
i
only
touched
on
them
here.
first,
the
respondent
ms.
tates
the
brzek
bloodshed
story
to
make
it
appear
that
the
witness
quoted
the
petitioner
as
saying,
and
i
quote
from
respondent's
brief,
"bloodshed
is
a
pre-condition
of
the
successful
revolution,
is
necessary
to
obtain
the
objectives
of
the
party
and
is
on
the
agenda."
these
words
so
out
of
character,
if
they
had
been
spoken
by
the
witness,
are
not
his
reference
supplied
by
the
respondent.
second
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
the
respondent,
your
honor.
second,
the
respondent
excises
two
of
the
petitioner's
published
articles
to
give
them
a
sinister
significance
which
the
full
text
negatives.
respondent's
tendentious
excerpts
and
the
context
from
which
they
were
wrenched
are
set
forth
at
pages
2
and
3
of
our
reply
brief.
third,
respondent
asserts
that
petitioner,
and
i
quote
from
respondent's
brief,
"repeatedly
endorsed
and
enjoined
upon
others
the
party
principles
of
military
discipline
and
preparation
for
violence."
but
then
document
seized
assertions
by
references
to
the
following,
first,
to
its
embroidered
version
of
the
brzek
bloodshed
tale,
second,
to
its
excise
version
of
petitioner's
articles
and
finally,
to
such
patently
innocent
matters,
as
petitioner's
statement
that
the
russian
revolution
succeeded
under
the
wise
leadership
of
lenin
and
stalin.
petitioner's
likening
of
the
communist
party
to
david
and
its
enemies
to
goliath
and
finally
to
the
fact
that
the
conclusion
of
a
meeting,
petitioner
asked
the
audience
to
rise
and
join
him
in
the
singing
of
"the
internationale".
now,
obviously,
neither
the
distortions
nor
the
trivialities
can
serve
as
a
substitute
for
proof.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
case
was
tried
and
decided
and
quite
a
different
theory
of
guilt.
that
theory
takes
us
to
its
point
of
departure
excerpts
from
the
so-called
classical
literature
of
communism,
the
political
polemics
of
marx,
engels,
lenin
and
stalin
written
some
30
to
100
years
ago.
from
this,
it
derives
the
following
inferences
and
hypothesis,
first,
the
excerpts
in
the
words
of
the
court
of
appeals,
and
i
quote,
"advocated
the
violent
overthrow
of
capitalist
governments
as
speedly
as
circumstances
would
permit".
second,
since
such
advocacy
appears
in
the
so-called
classical
literature,
it
is
a
permanent
and
immutable
dogma
of
marxism-leninism
applicable
to
all
capitalist
governments,
including
the
united
states,
at
all
times
and
under
all
circumstances.
third,
since
the
communist
party
acknowledges
its
adherence
to
the
principles
of
marxism-leninism,
current
advocacy
amounting
to
incitement
of
the
violent
overthrow
of
our
government
as
soon
as
circumstances
permit
can
be
imputed
to
that
organization.
fourth,
since
the
petitioner
was
an
active
member
and
officer
of
the
communist
party,
thus
familiar
with
this
classical
literature
and
thought
in
communist
party
schools,
knowledge
of
the
teaching
and
advocacy
thus
imputed
to
the
communist
party
can
be
imputed
likewise
to
petitioner.
and
finally,
from
the
same
bare
facts,
there
can
also
be
imputed
to
petitioner
the
specific
intent
to
bring
about
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
as
soon
as
circumstances
permit.
the
experienced
trial
judge,
judge
sullivan,
adopted
this
theory
of
guilt
only
with
the
greatest
reluctance,
stating
that
what
he
referred
to
as
the
so-called
communist
cases
had
modified
the
rules
of
evidence
that
he
knew
anything
about
and
change
the
law
as
he
had
practiced
it
during
his
many
years
on
the
bench.
now,
there
are
two
things
wrong
with
the
theory
applied
below.
first,
the
inferences
on
which
it
were
--
was
based
are
refuted
by
the
evidence.
and
second,
even
were
that
not
the
case,
the
--
the
conviction
of
the
petitioner
on
the
basis
of
this
kind
of
suspicious
deductive
logic
provides
a
supreme
example
of
what
mr.
justice
minton
once
called
guessing
a
man
into
a
federal
penitentiary.
as
to
the
first
fallacy,
the
uncontradicted
evidence
rebuts
the
tenuous
inference
relied
on
below
that
the
communist
party
advocated
revolutionary
violence.
indeed,
as
i've
indicated
before,
the
evidence
offered
by
the
prosecution
establishes
the
exact
contrary.
the
only
witness
on
this
branch
of
the
prosecution's
case
was
the
ineffable
lautner,
who
had
never
so
much
as
exchanged
a
word
with
the
petitioner
or
heard
him
speak.
now,
lautner's
testimony
differed
here
in
two
respects,
from
at
which
he
gave
them
other
smith
act
cases
including
the
scales
and
mesarosh
--
mesarosh
case
and
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
flynn
case
with
which
of
course
you're
very
familiar.first,
the
prosecution
confined
its
examination
solely
to
qualifying
lautner
as
an
expert
by
having
him
recite
his
positions
in
the
communist
party.
and
then
eliciting
his
opinion
over
our
objection
as
to
the
meaning
of
marxism-leninism
and
the
objectives
of
the
communist
party,
he
testified
solely
in
his
capacity
as
a
so-called
expert
opinion
testimony.
second,
and
more
importantly,
whether
because
of
the
novelty
of
the
role
in
which
he
found
himself
cast
are
for
some
other
reason
the
witness
dropped
his
key
lines,
which
had
been
so
well
reversed
in
other
cases.
the
result
is
like
a
performance
of
hamlet
without
the
soliloquies.
lautner
did
not
testify
at
either
marxism-leninism
or
the
communist
party
advocated
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government.
his
answers
on
direct
examination
are
set
forth
in
full
on
our
brief,
pages
14
and
15.
true,
he
used
the
words
"revolution"
and
"destruction",
but
as
the
trial
court
properly
instructed
the
jury,
neither
of
these
terms
implies
the
use
of
force
or
violence.
any
possible
ambiguity
in
the
direct
testimony
was
resolved
on
cross-examination.
when
the
witness
stated
unequivocally
that
it
was
the
position
of
the
communist
party
that
of
socialism
could
not
be
peacefully
established
in
this
country
by
elections
and
parliamentary
methods,
it
would
be
only
because
the
trust
and
monopolies
would
try
to
prevent
the
effectuation
of
the
popular
will
by
themselves
resorting
to
violence.
the
question
and
the
answer
on
cross-examination
are
reproduced
at
pages
35
and
36
of
my
brief.
thus,
the
prosecution's
own
expert
testified
that
the
advocacy
of
the
communist
party
was
peaceable.
the
respondent
devotes
an
appendix
to
its
brief
to
an
attempted
demonstration
that
the
communist
party
advocated
proscribed
doctrine.
apart
from
quotations
from
the
classics
and
the
embroidered
version
of
the
brzek
story,
which
i
have
just
mentioned,
there
was
only
one
reference
to
force
or
violence
in
this
entire
appendix
prepared
by
the
respondent
himself.
this
is
contained
in
a
statement
attributed
to
lautner
that
communist
strategy,
and
i
quote,
"is
always
directed
to
the
forcible
overthrow
and
destruction
of
the
government."
that
appears
at
respondent's
brief,
page
56.
in
fact,
lautner
made
no
such
statement.
its
attribution
to
him
is
a
pure
invention
as
a
reading
of
respondent's
own
reference
to
the
record
reveals,
and
the
record
reference
is
296-299.
moreover,
the
respondent's
appendix
ignores
the
only
two
statements
in
the
record
by
the
communist
party,
its
officers
or
members
concerning
the
means
for
achieving
socialism
in
this
country.
these
are
the
constitution
of
the
organization
and
the
authoritative
history
of
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states
written
by
william
z.
foster,
its
chairman,
in
1952.
both
documents
established
that
the
communist
party
advocated
a
peaceful
path
to
socialism
in
this
country.
not
only
is
there
nothing
in
the
record
to
the
contrary
but
as
i
have
shown,
the
government's
own
expert
corroborated
this
documentary
evidence
and
whatever
may
have
been
the
findings
of
parts
in
other
cases
on
other
records,
i
submit
that
on
this
record,
in
this
case,
there
must
be
a
finding
that
the
advocacy
of
a
communist
party
was
peaceable
and
that
therefore,
the
evidence
affirmatively
establishes
that
the
petitioner
was
innocent.
but
even
had
there
been
no
such
countervailing
evidence,
petitioner
cannot
be
deprived
of
his
liberty
by
imputing
guilty
knowledge
and
intent
from
a
whole
pyramid
of
inferences
based
upon
a
court's
interpretation
of
marxist-leninist
written
in
bygone
times
and
under
different
conditions.
the
schneiderman
case,
it's
at
respondent's
brief
that
strictly
ignores,
flatly
so
held.
furthermore,
herndon
against
lowry
demonstrates
that
petitioner
cannot
constitutionally
be
convicted
on
the
basis
of
such
inferences.
the
evidence
in
that
case,
the
court
will
recall,
not
only
established
herndon's
membership
and
extensive
activity
in
the
communist
party,
but
his
possession
of
a
current
document
issued
by
the
organization
that
the
court
said
advocated
violent
overthrow
at
some
future
time.
the
court,
however,
refused
to
impute
this
advocacy
to
the
defendant
but
it
invalidated
the
statute
and
reversed
the
conviction
in
the
words
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
describing
that
case
in
dennis,
"for
lack
of
proof
that
the
defendant
had
urged
or
even
approved".
those
are
the
party's
aims
which
are
unlawful.
here,
we
submit
that
this
case
could
have
been
submitted
to
the
jury
and
the
conviction
affirmed
only
by
ignoring
the
evidence
exonerating
the
petitioner
and
disregarding
the
presumption
of
innocence,
the
principal
at
guilt
is
personal,
the
constitutional
protection
accorded
expression
and
association
and
even
the
narrowest
application
of
section
4
(f)
of
the
internal
security
act
that
the
holding
of
office
or
membership
in
a
communist
organization
shall
not
be
a
crime
--
per
se
shall
not
be
a
crime
under
any
criminal
statute.
i
submitted,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
conviction
should
and
must
be
reversed
with
instructions
to
enter
a
judgement
of
acquittal.
the
next
point
that
i
shall
urge
concerns
the
denial
of
a
motion
by
the
petitioner
in
connection
with
the
brzek
bloodshed
story.
mr.
john
j.
abt
the
brzek
bloodshed
story,
your
honor.
brzek
testified
that
he
had
made
a
contemporaneous
report
to
the
fbi
on
this
1947
lecture,
which
was
a
subject
of
this
testimony.
the
petitioner
move
for
the
production
of
the
report
for
in
camera
inspection
by
the
trial
judge
so
that
the
judge
could
determine
whether
it
contradicted
the
testimony
and
was
therefore
material
to
the
defense.
prosecution
didn't
deny
the
availability
of
the
report
or
urge
that
its
contents
were
confidential
or
privileged.
nevertheless,
the
trial
court
denied
the
motion
and
the
rulings
affirmed
below.
now,
i
think
it's
clear
that
brzek's
repeated
inflammatory
references
to
bloodshed
were
highly
prejudicial
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
let
me
say
this
--
i
was
going
to
refer
to
that
later,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i'll
--
i'll
take
care
of
it
now.
the
judge,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
had
granted
a
similar
request
for
in
camera
inspection
with
reference
to
a
--
another
witness,
looked
at
the
report,
held
that
it
didn't
contradict
the
testimony
and
therefore
didn't
make
it
available
to
us.
when
i
renewed
the
motion
with
respect
or
made
another
motion
with
respect
to
this
witness,
the
court
simply
stated
that
it
was
a
matter
within
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court
and
that
he
was
denying
it.
but
i
can't
say
beyond
that
what
was
in
his
mind.
i
think
i
don't
have
to
press
the
question
that
brzek's
report
was
highly
prejudicial,
prosecution
leaned
very
heavily
on
it
in
summation,
respondent
leans
on
it
here
and
indeed,
the
court
of
appeals
leaned
on
it
in
its
opinion.
certainly,
for
the
period
that
brzek's
report
in
fact
contradicted
his
testimony,
petitioner
was
entitled
to
have
it,
the
use
of
it
in
cross-examination
and
entered
this
into
evidence.
gordon
against
the
united
states
so
held.
obviously,
the
contemporaneous
written
report
of
a
witness
furnishes
the
best
if
not
the
only
available
evidence
as
to
whether
its
contents
contradict
his
testimony.
accordingly,
the
practice
of
in
camera
inspection
of
such
a
report,
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
whether
it
discredits
the
witness,
has
been
approved
and
followed
in
the
second,
fourth,
fifth,
eighth
and
ninth
circuits.
the
cases
are
cited
in
our
brief,
page
63.
indeed,
this
practice
was
followed
in
the
yates
case
and
in
the
scales
case,
which
preceded
me.
and
as
i
say,
as
i've
already
said,
the
trial
judge
granted
a
similar
motion
with
respect
to
another
witness.
the
respondent,
in
its
brief,
concedes
that
the
trial
judge
had
the
power
to
grant
our
motion
but
urges
that
there
was
no
abuse
of
discretion
in
its
denial.
the
only
reason
that
it
advances
is
that
the
motion
was
not
made
until
immediately
after
the
witness
stepped
down
from
the
stand.
but
obviously
that
fact
did
not
and
could
not
have
prejudiced
the
prosecution
in
any
way
and
it
would
not
have
foreclosed
us
from
using
a
report
if
the
report
had
been
made
available
to
us,
either
by
recalling
a
witness
or
by
putting
it
in
our
affirmative
case.
now,
only
recently,
this
court,
in
a
case
with
which
i'm
not
unfamiliar,
stated
the
standard
to
be
applied
where
there's
a
challenge
to
the
testimony
as
tainted.
this
tedious
regard
for
the
honor
of
the
administration
of
justice,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
wrote
requires
the
court
to
make
certain
that
the
doing
of
justice
be
so
manifest
that
only
irrational
or
perverse
claims
of
its
disregard
can
be
asserted.
it
can
hardly
be
argued,
i
submit,
that
this
standard
has
met
for
a
court
refuses
even
to
examine
a
document
in
the
possession
of
the
prosecution
which
may
completely
discredit
the
testimony
of
a
key
witness
upon
which
the
case
for
conviction
was
state.
moreover,
the
repeatedly
demonstrated
untrustworthiness
of
the
testimony
of
informers,
most
recently
and
dramatically
revealed
in
the
decision
of
yesterday,
the
man's
judicial
inspection
of
very
relevant
fbi
reports
as
the
minimum
precaution
to
assure
defendants
a
fair
trial
and
to
safeguard
the
administration
of
justice
against
the
use
of
tainted
testimony.
may
i
add,
indeed,
that
that
procedure
had
been
followed
in
the
mesarosh
case
possibly
the
messy
debacle
might
have
been
avoided.
mr.
john
j.
abt
he
was
the
last
witness,
mr.
justice
black.
at
the
moment
he
got
--
he
stepped
down
from
the
stand,
i
moved
to
the
bench
and
made
my
motion.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
brought
it
out
in
the
course
of
a
very
brief
cross-examination.
during
the
same
day?
mr.
john
j.
abt
oh,
yes,
of
course.
he
was
only
on
the
stand
altogether
for
a
very
short
while.
i
don't
think
i
cross-examined
him
for
more
than
five
or
10
minutes.
and
immediately
at
the
conclusion
of
that
cross-examination
has
he
stepped
down
from
the
stand
i
made
my
motion.
mr.
john
j.
abt
the
argument
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
that's
what
they
say,
your
honor.
that's
the
only
argument
they
give
as
to
why
--
why
the
discretion
was
properly
exercised
in.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
have
to
look
for
it,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
abt
no,
i
think
i
can
find
it.
it
must
be
shortly
after
462
of
--
where
the
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
--
the
testimony
appeared.
mr.
john
j.
abt
or
you'll
--
you'll
find
it
in
my
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
may
have
it
here
but
i
doubt
it.
mr.
john
j.
abt
what
--
the
exact
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
--
the
--
the
exact
words
that
the
court
used
were
these.
judge
sullivan
said,
"as
i
read
the
mesarosh
case,"
and
he
was
referring
to
the
district
court
decision
in
that
case,
"as
i
read
the
mesarosh
case,
i
think
it's
a
matter
within
my
discretion
and
i
deny
the
motion."
that's
all
he
said.
mr.
john
j.
abt
is
that
at
472,
your
honor?
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
don't
know.
that's
all
there
is.
mr.
john
j.
abt
that's
all
the
light
we
have
on
the
workings
of
his
mind,
yes,
sir.
now,
unless
the
court
has
further
questions
on
that
matter,
i
want
to
come
to
my
next
point.
mr.
john
j.
abt
surely
it's
a
matter
of
discretion,
your
honor.
the
testimony
of
the
witness
might
be
trivial,
immaterial,
unimportant.
here,
the
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
where
it
isn't
there
is
no
discretion.
that's
a
minimum
--
minimum
precaution
that
the
court
needs
to
take
to
prevent
repetition
of
the
kind
of
a
performance
we
had
here
yesterday,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
abt
and
it's
no
longer
in
the
realm
of
discretion.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
would
say
this.
mr.
john
j.
abt
if
--
yes,
if
the
witness
gives
some
testimony,
it's
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
it's
damaging.
and
some
of
them
is
immaterial
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
--
to
the
conviction
and
you've
got
a
right
to
show
he's
a
liar,
a
liar
either
with
respect
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
think
we
can
call
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes.
i
think
we
can
do
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
right.
i
think
we
can
do
--
go
to
this
extent,
at
least,
your
honor.
we
can
call
for
it
not
for
production
to
us
but
for
production
to
the
trial
judge
so
that
he
can
make
a
preliminary
determination
as
to
whether
it
contradicts
the
testimony.
and
that's
what
all
of
these
cases
have
held.
i
think
that
that's
the
minimum
precaution
which
the
trial
court
should
take
in
such
a
situation.
and
it's
--
it's
often
been
said,
the
prosecutor
has
no
interest
in
procuring
a
--
a
conviction
unless
we've
got
the
evidence.
and
if
he
has,
in
his
possession,
anything
that
contradicts
the
evidence
that
he's
produced
in
court,
the
defense
is
entitled
to
it.
i
think
that
that's
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
the
government
resisted,
gave
no
reason
for
resisting
it,
just
said
that
--
as
i
say,
they
didn't
claim
that
the
report
was
confidential
or
privileged.
they
didn't
deny
its
availability.
mr.
john
j.
abt
didn't
have
it
there
in
court,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
abt
it's
been
made
to
the
--
to
the
milwaukee
office
of
the
fbi,
which
is
two
hours
away
from
chicago.
that's
what
all
he
said.
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes,
he
joined
the
party
at
the
request
of
the
fbi.
mr.
john
j.
abt
nothing
made
of
that.
mr.
john
j.
abt
nothing
made
of
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
well,
no,
couldn't
have
done
--
couldn't
have
hold
the
trial
to
the
court.
i
mean
you
couldn't
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
--
couldn't
have
gone
on
with
the
trial
rather
because
it
so
happen
that
he
was
the
last
witness.
mr.
john
j.
abt
but
it
was
in
the
afternoon,
it
meant
--
what
it
meant
in
a
germane
overnight
perhaps
to
get
that
report,
that
was
all
that
was
involved
in
the
hoping.
mr.
john
j.
abt
no,
no,
your
honor,
he
did
not.
mr.
john
j.
abt
well,
perhaps
--
perhaps,
your
--
perhaps
you're
right,
mr.
justice
clark.
i
may
be
wrong.
mr.
john
j.
abt
452.
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice
clark.
what
page
are
you
reading
from?
mr.
john
j.
abt
no,
but
then
--
then
he
went
on
--
the
foundation
of
course
what
he
was
--
what
he
was
saying
about
with
respect
to
that,
justice
clark,
was
that
i
had
not
brought
out
in
or
attempted
to
in
cross-examination
kept
the
witness
to
concede
that
his
report
contradicted
his
testimony.
but
then
immediately
following
that,
he
refers
to
the
--
what's
called
here
the
mesarosh
case,
which
is
the
mesarosh
case,
in
which
the
court
approved
the
line
of
cases
that
i
have
cited
in
my
brief
saying
(inaudible)
was
discretionary
with
the
court
as
what
would
or
wouldn't
inspect
records.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
have
no
idea,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
--
or
must
be
a
reported
error.
earlier
i
had
pointed
out
--
i
don't
have
the
page
here,
that
the
mails
were
still
operating
between
here
and
over
chicago
and
milwaukee
and
--
page
469,
mr.
parsons,
"we
don't
know
whether
they
exist
or
not.
i
said
the
witness
said
he
had
made
written
reports
and
there
is
no
doubt
about
their
existence."
mr.
parsons,
"otherwise
we
would
rest
--
but
they
do
another
exhibit
previously
it
said
that
the
reports
have
been
made
to
milwaukee.
at
any
case,
no
--
no
point
has
ever
been
made
by
the
government
as
to
the
unavailability
of
the
reports.
i'd
now
like
to
go
on,
if
i
may,
to
add
four
observations
to
what
has
already
been
said
about
section
4
(f).
first,
the
legislative
history,
which
i
cited
in
pages
79
to
80
of
my
brief,
established
beyond
peradventure,
i
think,
that
the
reference
to
any
other
criminal
statutes
was
not
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
calls
a
declaratory
statement
but
was
added
with
a
membership
clause
of
the
smith
act
and
nothing
else
in
mind.
second,
the
legislative
history
also
establishes
that
the
congress
believed
that
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
compelled
it
to
choose
between
the
registration
provisions
of
the
internal
security
act
and
the
membership
clause
of
the
smith
act
as
a
means
for
dealing
with
members
of
the
communist
party
whose
only
overt
act
was
the
act
of
membership.
after
much
deliberation,
it
chose
the
former,
that
is
the
internal
security
act,
and
so
amended
section
4
(f)
to
immunize
communist
party
members
from
prosecution
under
that
clause.
third,
i
submit
that
the
fact
that
this
was
a
result
that
congress
intended
and
indeed
thought
it
had
achieved
is
confirmed
by
the
legislative
history
of
the
humphrey
amendment
to
the
communist
control
act
of
1954.
that
amendment
proposed
to
make
membership
in
the
communist
party
with
knowledge
of
its
alleged
seditious
purpose
a
crime.
the
amendment
and
the
author's
explanation
of
its
provisions
are
--
are
quoted
at
page
81
of
my
brief,
perfectly
clear
from
the
face
of
the
amendment
and
from
senator
humphrey's
explanation
that
the
crime
which
he
proposed
to
create
was
identical
with
the
crime
charged
in
the
indictment.
the
court
will
recall,
i'm
sure,
that
the
attorney
general
and
the
majority
leadership
in
congress
vigorously
opposed
this
amendment
on
the
ground
that
it
would
make
the
registration
provisions
of
the
internal
security
act
unenforceable
by
repealing
the
immunity
conferred
by
section
4
(f).
i've
quoted
typical
and
authoritative
statements
made
on
the
floor
at
both
the
senate
and
the
house
to
that
effect
in
an
appendix
to
my
brief,
page
99.
it
was
a
result
of
these
representations
by
the
attorney
general
and
the
congressional
leadership,
that
the
humphrey
amendment
was
defeated.
now,
it's
perfectly
apparent
that
the
controversy
over
that
amendment
was
based
on
the
understanding
that
because
of
section
4
(f)
of
the
internal
security
act,
membership
in
the
communist
party
with
knowledge
of
its
alleged
unlawful
purpose
was
not
a
crime
under
the
existing
law
and
on
the
belief,
in
addition,
that
to
make
it
a
crime
would
render
the
internal
security
act
unenforceable.
and
that
legislative
history,
we
submit,
confirms
that
confirmation
were
needed.
the
proposition
that
congress
intended
to
make
the
membership
clause
of
the
smith
act
unavailable
for
the
prosecution
of
communists
by
section
4
(f)
and
as
i
say,
indeed
believed
that
section
4
(f)
would
achieve
that
objective.
fourth
and
last,
with
respect
to
section
4
(f),
i
just
want
to
add
a
word
to
what
general
taylor
said
about
the
savings
clause.
in
addition
to
the
general
principle
which
he
cited
in
this
case,
in
the
case
of
this
act,
the
savings
clause
was
a
part
of
the
bill
as
reported
out
by
committee.
the
amendment
to
section
4
(f),
which
we're
discussing,
was
added
as
a
last
minute
measure
on
the
floor
of
the
house.
obviously,
congress
at
the
time
it
did
this
didn't
have
in
mind
any
possible
inconsistency
between
that
amendment
and
the
savings
clause,
which
simply
reinforces
the
principle
of
statutory
construction
to
which
general
taylor
referred.
mr.
john
j.
abt
passed
that
after
savings
clause,
your
honor.
the
savings
clause
appears
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
added
after
the
savings
clause.
mr.
john
j.
abt
and
added
as
a
last
minute
measure
as
before
--
before
the
bill
was
enacted.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i'm
--
i'm
just
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
no.
mr.
john
j.
abt
no,
you
can't,
your
honor.
i'm
simply
citing
that
fact
to
reinforce
the
general
principle
of
statutory
construction
to
which
mr.
taylor
adverted
to
show
that
it
was
particularly
pertinent
--
the
application
particularly
pertinent
to
this
case.
i
now
turn
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
membership
clause
as
applied
in
this
case.
yesterday
and
again,
today,
if
i
understood
the
purport
of
the
solicitor
general's
remarks
in
his
colloquy
with
mr.
justice
harlan,
he
stated
that
the
constitutional
application
of
the
statute
requires
proof
of
sufficient
acts
by
the
accused
to
establish
the
conclusion
that
the
accused
had
the
specific
intent
to
bring
about
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
as
soon
as
circumstances
permit.
as
i
understand
him,
it's
his
position
that
a
mere
expression
of
the
belief
or
opinion
is
not
alone
enough,
something
more
is
required.
what's
necessary,
again
as
i
understand
them,
is
something
in
the
nature
of
an
overt
act,
an
act
not
in
furtherance
of
some
innocent
activity
of
the
organization
but
an
act
in
furtherance
of
the
proscribed
works.
he
said
that
an
instruction
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
pardon?
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
would
certainly
--
if
you
were
asking
me,
your
honor,
i
would
certainly
include
words
of
incitement.
under
the
dennis
case,
i
have
to
include
words
of
incitement.
as
in
scales,
no
instruction
to
that
effect
was
given
--
requested
by
the
government
or
given
by
the
court
below.
the
case
was
neither
tried
nor
submitted
to
the
jury
on
that
theory.
furthermore,
the
record
here
is
devoid
of
evidence
of
the
sort
--
that
the
--
that
the
solicitor
general
now
says
it's
required.
his
own
brief
concedes
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
petitioner
engaged
in
anything
but
peaceable
activity
and
constitutionally-protected
expression
during
the
three
years
preceding
the
indictment.
and
indeed,
his
conduct
prior
to
that
time,
as
i
have
shown,
was
just
as
innocent.
thus,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
a
--
have
an
implicit
acknowledgement
from
the
solicitor
general
that
by
his
own
standard,
the
conviction
of
petitioner
violated
the
first
amendment.
but
it
seems
to
me,
furthermore,
that
there's
no
warrant
whatsoever
for
the
gloss
that
the
petitioner
general
--
the
solicitor
general
puts
on
the
statute.
and
without
that
clause,
i
submit
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
or
even
though
you
may
garnish
membership
with
such
subjective
factors
as
knowledge
and
intent,
the
fact
remains
that
the
only
act
that
the
statute
punishes
is
the
bare
act
of
association.
and
under
our
constitution,
if
i
understand
it,
association
cannot
be
made
a
crime
unless
it
is
accompanied
by
acts
or
advocacy
that
amount
to
aiding
or
abetting
the
unlawful
purpose
of
the
organization.
that
is
the
teaching
of
the
de
jonge
and
herndon
and
that
mr.
justice
brandeis'
historic
concurrence
in
whitney,
a
--
a
principle
which
was
reiterated
by
the
court
in
the
douds
case.
and
whatever
else
dennis
may
stand
for,
i
submit
that
it
did
not
modify
or
qualify
this
principle.
for
all
three
majority
decisions
emphasized
that
it
was
the
existence
of
an
active
conspiracy
that
created
the
danger.
and
mr.
justice
vinson
stressed
that
it
was
the
nature
of
the
defendan's
activities
and
their
power
to
bring
about
the
evil
that
brought
them
outside
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
under
the
membership
clause,
however,
an
accused
might
be
convicted
without
proof
of
any
activities
whatsoever
and
notwithstanding
that
he
is
powerless
to
bring
about
the
evil.
that
--
those
propositions,
i
submit,
are
decisive
of
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
membership
clause.
i
shan't
burden
the
court
with
argument
of
the
remaining
questions
discussed
in
my
brief.
to
conclude,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
conviction
here
and
its
affirmance
below
would
have
been
simply
unthinkable
before
the
decision,
the
decision
in
dennis
and
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
decisions
that
followed
in
its
wake.
as
for
myself,
i
believe
that
dennis
was
wrongly
decided.
and
i
share
the
hope
so
eloquently
expressed
by
mr.
justice
black
that
in
calmer
times
when
present
pressures,
passions
and
fear
subside,
this
or
some
later
court
will
restore
the
first
amendment
liberties
to
the
height
or
birthplace
where
they
belong
in
a
free
society.
but
whatever
the
ultimate
fate
of
the
dennis
decision
may
be,
it
furnishes
no
warrant.
surely
in
the
calmer
times
we
are
already
--
are
already
beginning
to
experience
for
the
constitutionality
of
the
membership
clause.
and
surely,
nothing
that
was
said
in
that
case
can
provide
a
precedence
--
precedent
for
the
affirmance
of
a
conviction
on
this
record
devoid
as
it
is
of
evidence
of
illicit
advocacy,
incitement
to
violence
or
seditious
knowledge
or
intent.
mr.
john
j.
abt
oh,
surely
not
because
i
--
as
i
tried
to
--
to
point
out,
there
was
no
knowledge
either
of
the
intent
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
of
course.
mr.
john
j.
abt
that's
right.
i
don't
(inaudible)
abandoned
my
(inaudible)
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
still
think
that's
a
good
point.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
shall
detain
the
court
only
for
a
moment.
the
solicitor
general
acknowledged
in
his
argument
his
reference
--
the
record
reference
in
his
brief
to
document
the
proposition
that
lautner
had
testified
that
the
communist
party
advocates
force
and
violence
was
incorrect.
he
cited
--
referred
to
your
honors
to
other
portions
of
lautner's
testimony.
it
did
not
tell,
your
honors,
and
he
could
not,
that
lautner,
at
any
point
in
the
other
testimony
to
which
he
referred
you,
said
that
the
communist
party
advocated
force
and
violence.
those
other
portions
of
the
testimony
or
the
relevant
ones
are
referred
to
in
my
brief
or
quoted
in
full
of
my
brief.
i
think
i
referred
you
to
the
page
in
the
brief
previously,
page
14
and
15.
the
solicitor
general
also
said
that
he
believes
that
lautner
wanted
to
say
or
had
it
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
to
say
that
the
organization
advocated
force
and
violence
but
never
got
around
to
it.
now,
it
seems
to
me
from
those
acknowledgements,
i
have
to
add
a
new
layer
to
the
pyramid
of
inferences,
which
i
described
initially.
there's
a
new
inference
and
imputation
or
further
one
that
the
court
has
to
indulge
in
--
in
order
to
find
any
evidence
of
guilty
knowledge.
solicitor
general
now
imputes
to
his
own
witness
his
interpretation
of
the
writings
of
marx,
engels,
lenin
and
stalin
and
his
understanding
of
what
the
communist
party
advocated
and
then
imputes
that
to
the
communist
party
and
then
to
the
petitioner.
now,
i
submit,
if
the
court
please,
that
you
just
cannot
deprive
a
man
of
his
liberty,
send
him
to
jail
for
five
years
on
the
basis
of
that
kind
of
speculation.
and
again,
referring
to
mr.
justice
minton,
he
said
in
the
pereira
case
that
it
might
be
a
good
guess
but
it
was
bad
proof.
here,
it
isn't
even
a
good
guess
with
some
bad
guess.
mr.
john
j.
abt
of
course,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
abt
well,
it
has
to
be
crucial,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
abt
how
can
a
man
--
how
can
a
man
be
cruel
to
know
what
doesn't
exist
and
knowledge
of
the
prescribed
advocacy
is
essential
that
there
was
no
prescribed
advocacy
(inaudible)
mr.
john
j.
abt
indeed.
indeed,
there
--
it
is
contrasted.
i
--
i'd
like
to
add
just
one
more
thing.
if
your
honors
agree
with
me
on
my
analysis
of
the
evidence,
i
would
urge
you
not
to
send
this
case
back
for
a
new
trial
but
to
reverse
with
directions
to
enter
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
and
i
say
that
for
several
reasons.
first,
this
isn't
the
type
of
case
to
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
referred
the
other
day
where
the
government
tried
its
case
on
an
erroneous
theory
of
the
law.
the
government
knew
what
it
had
to
prove
here.
what
it
had
to
prove
is
very
simple,
if
there's
any
doubt
about
whether
it
had
to
prove
the
schneiderman
case
told
it
what
it
had
to
prove.
more
than
that,
the
failure
of
proof
here
is
not
on
some
technical
matter,
neglect
to
cross
an
i
or
cross
a
t
or
dot
an
i.
there's
a
complete
and
absolute
failure
to
prove
any
of
the
elements
of
the
offense.
under
those
circumstances,
i
submit
that
the
government
is
not
entitled
to
another
bite
of
the
cherry.
more
than
that,
we're
concerned
here
not
with
an
ordinary
crime
but
with
a
crime
that
involves
conduct
within
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
and
i
submit
that's
nothing.
put
more
restrain
in
the
exercise
of
the
first
amendment
right,
then
not
only
a
reversal
of
the
case
when
the
crime
hasn't
been
proved
but
putting
a
defendant
upon
trial
a
second
time.
more
than
that,
and
i
want
to
be
very
realistic,
i
don't
think
that
the
government
here
is
entitled
to
another
trial
where
it
would
put
its
man,
lautner,
on
the
stand
who
would
recall
the
soliloquy's
that
he
left
out
the
last
time
and
where
it
would
get
them
easy
to
pinch
it
for
a
prissy.
i've
looked
with
this
case
a
long
time,
if
the
court
please,
feel
deeply
about
it
and
perhaps
you'll
forgive
me
if
i
feel
strongly
about
it.
but
if
the
court
agrees
with
my
testament
of
the
evidence,
i
believe
that
it
would
be
unfair,
unjust
and
indeed,
a
violation
of
the
common
decency
not
to
--
to
reverse
and
remand
for
a
new
trial
and
not
to
enter
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
thank
you.
