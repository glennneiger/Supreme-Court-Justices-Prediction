justice
john
m.
harlan
what
reason
did
the
court
give
to
that
disposition?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
brzek
a
government
agent?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
say
the
amendment
was
passed
after
the
savings
clause?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
was
added
after
the
savings
clause.
justice
john
m.
harlan
when
was
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
--
do
you
include
words
in
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
words
of
incitement
that
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
one
question
before
you
sit
down?
i
understood
your
first
proposition
to
be
that
even
if
you
take
the
statute
as
constitutionally
satisfying
the
constitution
simply
by
the
--
importing
the
element
of
specific
intent
and
of
course
actual
knowledge,
that
even
under
that
standard,
the
evidence
doesn't
justify
the
conviction
of
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
you're
leaving
out
the
additional
gloss
of
the
government
perhaps
to
be
putting
on.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
one
question
more
about
this
active
membership
proposition?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
your
view,
does
the
requirement
of
active
membership,
is
that
sufficed
by
innocent
activity?
is
that
enough?
or
does
it
have
to
be
activity
of
the
character
that
implements
--
is
directed
to
force
and
violence?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
like
the
overt
act
concept
--
that
the
overt
act
in
a
conspiracy
maybe,
of
itself,
innocent
but
if
it's
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy,
why,
then
it's
enough,
it's
an
overt
act.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
--
that
same
concept
that
you
reported
to
this
activity
and
membership.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
that's
enough
of
a
foundation
as
a
pretty
formal
ritualistic
proposition,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
go
through
that
formula?
the
witness
obviously
has
made
a
--
if
your
statement
that
a
foundation
is
enough,
why
do
you
have
to
go
through
that
formula?
why
--
once
you
have
the
report
acknowledged
there
had
been
a
report,
why
do
you
have
to
ask
that
question
that
justice
black
asked
you
about?
why
not
just
--
why
isn't
the
judge
obligated
to
look
at
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
obviously,
he
won't
and
if
he's
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
lied
about
it,
he
certainly
is
going
to
stick
with
his
lies.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
this
particular
case,
if
i
understand
the
government's
brief
correctly,
the
--
it's
crucial
as
to
whether
the
evidence
as
to
the
purposes
of
the
party
were
violent
or
not.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
crucial
because
they
say
in
their
brief
though
the
evidence
showed
no
expressed
declarations
in
this
period
stating
his
advocacy
of
the
force
and
violence
in
so
many
words,
it
was
shown
that
he
had
never
departed
from
or
cease
laboring
to
this
objective.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i'm
thinking
of
this
in
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
contrast
to
scales
where
there
was
direct
evidence
of
declaration.
