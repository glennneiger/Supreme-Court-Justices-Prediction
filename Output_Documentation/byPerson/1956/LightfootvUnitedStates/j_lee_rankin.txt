mr.
j.
lee
rankin
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
clear
up
first
the
arguments
about
the
record.
we
do
not
agree
with
counsel
that
the
government
misquoted
the
record
in
any
place
except
that
we
do
refer
to
the
record,
as
counsel
states
in
his
reply
brief
on
page
5.
in
our
brief
on
page
56,
we
cite
as
authority
only
the
records
pages
296
to
299.
i
think
in
order
to
be
accurate,
although
we
don't
try
to
quote
that
point,
as
the
court
will
note,
we
tried
to
paraphrase
or
show
our
conclusions
about
the
testimony.
however,
to
be
more
accurate,
if
we
should
cite
also
the
direct
testimony
of
the
witness,
mr.
lautner,
which
is
back
at
pages
204
to
211
in
that
area
in
the
record
from
which
we
draw
the
conclusions
as
to
the
thrust
of
the
witness
lautner's
testimony.
and
the
court
will
note
it
that
on
pages
296
and
299
that
the
witness
was
interrupted
and
it's
quite
apparent
from
the
remarks
of
counsel
himself
at
the
time
that
he
appreciated
the
thrust
of
the
testimony
at
an
earlier
time.
but
the
record,
as
cited,
does
not
support
it.
we
think
that
otherwise,
the
government's
brief
is
fully
supported
by
the
record
and
the
court
would
have
to
examine
it
in
detail
to
determine
for
itself.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
on
page
56.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
--
between
204
and
211,
there
are
detailed
record
of
the
testimony
of
mr.
lautner
in
which
he
elaborates
the
theory
and
principles
of
marxism
and
leninism
and
what
he
construes
and
understands
as
an
expert
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
i'd
also
like,
before
starting
into
my
general
argument,
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
this
case,
as
well
as
in
scales,
the
fact
that
membership
is
admitted
and
so
as
you
will
note
in
examining
these
instructions,
and
i
would
like
to
ask
you
to
examine
them
carefully
in
both
cases
because
the
court
was
very
careful
in
both
cases.
in
fact,
in
this
case,
the
court
was
very
stringent
on
the
government
in
the
instructions
that
were
given
and
gave
a
very
great
area
of
protection
to
the
defendant
in
the
instructions.
but
the
court
in
this
case
as
well
as
scales
did
not
submit
the
question
of
membership
because
it
was
admitted
and
so
told
the
jury.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i'd
like
to
call
briefly
to
the
attention
of
the
court
the
record
of
this
petitioner
in
the
communist
party
that
extends
for
a
period
of
some
20
years
of
activity.
membership
is
conceded
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
he
was
also
an
alternate
member
of
the
national
committee
of
the
communist
party
at
the
time
of
the
trial
as
the
governing
body
of
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states
today.
that's
conceded
too.
he
was
a
member
as
early
as
1930.
in
1934,
he
was
the
south
side
organizer
in
the
chicago
area.september
of
1934,
he
became
a
full-time
party
functionary.
then
he
became
a
member
and
organizer
of
the
south
side
section
of
the
illinois-indiana
district.
1936,
he
went
to
moscow
as
a
delegate
to
the
sixth
world
congress
of
the
communist
international.
1936
to
1940,
he
became
an
organizer
of
the
south
side
section,
member
of
the
district
committee
of
the
communist
party
of
the
illinois-indiana
district.
and
he'd
collaborated
with
mr.
haywood
in
the
preparation
of
the
communist
party
pamphlet.
he
became
an
instructor
in
the
chicago
worker
school
on
behalf
of
the
party,
which
the
curriculum
was
largely
based
on
the
marxist-leninist
doctrines.
then
he
collaborated
with
mr.
meyer,
who
was
--
went
to
school
in
this
country
and
was
educated
at
oxford,
came
back
to
this
country
and
was
one
of
the
leading
teachers
and
planners
of
the
teachers
in
--
teaching
and
training
of
the
communist
party
in
the
united
states
as
to
the
doctrines,
objects
and
aims
of
the
party.
and
this
mr.
meyer
worked
with
the
petitioner
in
this
case
to
determine
that
his
teachings
of
the
communist
objectives
and
aims
in
the
various
schools
in
which
he
taught
adequately
presented
the
revolutionary
doctrine
of
the
proletarian
before
the
various
students
in
the
school.
and
mr.
meyer
testified
in
the
case
that
he
was
an
excellent
teacher.
our
brief
on
pages
18
through
20
elaborate
the
activity
of
this
petitioner
during
the
critical
period.
but
it's
the
theory
of
the
government
that
the
jury
and
the
court
had
the
right
to
look
back
at
the
record
of
this
man
and
the
knowledge
that
he
had
in
teaching
these
doctrines
and
revolutionary
purposes
throughout
this
period
including
the
evidence
as
to
the
force
and
violence
prior
to
this
critical
period
with
no
showing
of
any
kind
that
he
ever
changed
his
mind
any
other
purpose,
and
then
the
fact
that
he
is
today
an
alternate
member
of
the
governing
body
of
this
party
with
all
of
that
mean
and
attended
various
functions,
one
of
which
he
urged
the
infiltration
of
key
positions
of
industry
by
those
members
of
the
party
and
attendants
so
that
they
could
further
the
aims
of
the
party
and
honor
gil
green,
one
of
the
defendants
in
the
dennis
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that
the
--
the
membership
can
be
involved
innocent
activity
under
the
constitution,
but
i
think
you
have
to
find
intent
to
accomplish
those
objectives
and
aims
under
the
government's
theory
by
his
acts
or
his
position
in
combination
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct,
mr.
justice.
we
undertook
that
burden
and
we
established
very
clearly
by
the
evidence
in
this
case
that
that
was
the
doctrine
of
the
party,
that's
what
they
were
busy
teaching
and
they
were
trying
to
establish
their
people
in
key
positions
in
industry
in
this
country
so
as
to
accomplish
the
revolution
by
force
and
violence
as
soon
as
they
could.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
now,
there
is
this
element
that
the
government
recognizes
in
the
case
in
which
it
was
developed
on
cross-examination
of
mr.
lautner
and
also
by
the
presentation
of
the
material
of
mr.
foster
at
the
party
took
a
position
that
the
force
and
violence
that
they
were
going
to
use
was
when
they
accomplished
their
peaceful
revolution.
and
the
trust
in
monopolies
in
the
united
states
used
force
and
violence
to
try
to
put
them
out,
that
they
would
then
use
force
and
violence
to
maintain
their
position.
and
it's
very
clearly
shown
that
mr.
foster's
presentation
of
that
theory
was
developed
after
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
dennis
case.
and
the
jury
had
before
it,
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
showing
as
to
what
they
taught
day
after
day,
month
after
month
and
year
after
year
in
their
classes
about
marxism
and
leninism
and
how
this
revolution
should
be
done
by
force
and
violence
at
the
earliest
opportunity
or
whether
or
not
the
theory
developed
by
mr.
foster
after
the
dennis
case
and
what
mr.
lautner
admitted
was
one
of
the
theories
that
the
party
talked
about
peaceful
revolution
in
this
manner
was
the
correct
doctrine
and
aim
according
to
the
evidence
in
this
case
and
that
was
submitted
to
them
for
them
to
conclude.
and
i
think
it
was
properly
for
the
jury
to
determine
that
question.
now,
with
regard
to
the
fbi
reports,
it's
the
government's
position
that
the
request
in
this
case
was
to
lay
but
that
is
one
--
only
one
factor
the
witness
had
left
the
stand.
the
second
factor
is
that
there
was
no
foundation
laid
whatsoever
as
to
any
contradiction
of
a
witness'
testimony
by
the
fbi
reports.
as
we
read
the
gordon
case,
this
court
said
that
if
there's
a
foundation
laid
and
it
showed
that
there's
a
contradiction,
then
there
is
a
question
of
an
abuse
of
discretion.
now,
there
wasn't
even
an
inquiry.
in
the
first
place,
the
witness
didn't
use
these
reports
to
refresh
his
memory
at
all.
he
testified
from
his
recollection
and
as
the
court
knows,
there's
a
different
rule
of
discretion
in
that
kind
of
a
situation
than
in
the
case
where
the
witness
uses
any
reports
or
records
to
refresh
his
memory.
but
beyond
that,
here
was
this
witness
on
the
stand,
in
the
courtroom,
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner
only
had
to
say
was,
“did
you
ever
give
a
report
to
the
fbi
and
was
that
report
--
did
you
ever
say
one
word
that
was
inconsistent
or
didn't
corroborate
everything
you
say?
or
was
there
any
fraction
of
it
that
was
not
consistent?”
now,
isn't
that
a
rule
of
law
that
this
court
can
sustain?
here's
the
trial
court,
that
if
--
the
record
comes
here
from
the
trial
court
and
isn't
it
fair
that
the
trial
court
have
a
right
to
determine
and
use
his
discretion
in
these
matters
that
he
at
least
be
advised
of
where
there
is
an
inconsistency
or
a
possibility
that
can
be
considered
by
him
when
you
say
he
abuses
his
discretion
before
you
come
and
overturn
his
--
his
exercise
of
discretion
and
conducting
the
work
of
this
court?
now,
there's
a
reason
why
they
don't
ask
the
question.
it
hurts
if
they
asked
the
question
and
the
reports
corroborate,
the
witness
so
testifies,
then
they've
got
the
problem
of
what
they
asked
for
the
reports.
and
the
reports,
if
they
corroborate
too,
it
hurts
worst
than
to
have
a
witness
say
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
that
is
another
problem
but
it
seems
to
me
that
as
a
matter
of
rule
of
law
that
the
court
has
to
deal
with
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
there
should
be
some
foundation
laid
if
you're
going
to
say
that
a
trial
court
in
trying
to
conduct
an
orderly
process
before
the
court
can
exercise
its
discretion
without
knowledge,
without
any
showing
that
there's
anything
that
he
should
be
looking
into.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that
would
be
sufficient
for
this
court
to
want
to
examine
him
and
for
the
court
--
as
this
court
did
in
one
case,
in
this
very
case
in
one
report,
did
examine
himself,
satisfied
there
was
no
inconsistencies
in
that
instance
and
then
sealed
it
for
this
court
to
look
at
if
it
cared
to.
i'm
sure
the
way
this
court
conducted
himself
that
if
they've
made
any
such
inquiry,
they
would
have
gotten
the
reports
to
the
judge,
he
would
have
determined
the
situation
in
the
same
way
he
did
in
the
other.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
i
--
i
think
that
that
is
the
best
that
they
can
do
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
think
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
a
further
inquiry
at
least
to
have
the
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
witness
had
plainly
falsified
about
that
answer.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
witness
admits
that
there
is
something
--
some
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
he
might
have
not
reported
at
all.
i
mean,
often
times
people,
in
giving
statements
to
counsel
who
recollects
something
that
they
do
not
always
report.
and
i
think
that's
a
reasonable
inquiry
as
to
whether
or
not
he
fully
described
everything
to
the
fbi.
but
the
mere
fact
that
he
didn't
might
not
prove
that
he
was
untruthful
at
all
as
we
all
know
from
experience.
however,
it
would
--
it
might
have
some
bearing
upon
the
situation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
he
made
a
motion
orally,
and
i
think
he
could,
but
i
think
he
first
should
examine
to
determine
whether
there's
any
discrepancy
in
the
testimony.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
to
--
to
examine
the
fbi
reports.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
was
established
by
his
inquiry
to
the
witness.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
i'm
not
going
back
into
the
question
of
section
4
(f)
unless
there's
some
questions
the
court
may
wish
to
direct
me
in
regard
to
it
except
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
except
that
counsel
has
referred
to
the
act
of
1954
as
though
that
history
might
add
something.
of
course,
that's
four
years
later.
and
i
believe
the
court
can
examine
almost
anything
about
legislative
history
as
to
what
the
congress
has
done
under
the
rules
but
there
certainly
is
not
as
very
much
of
a
contribution
from
what
essence
four
years
later
after
the
statute
was
passed.
regardless
of
that,
in
the
legislative
history
for
the
act
of
1954,
we
have
some
pretty
direct
expressions
in
regard
to
this
very
matter
and
senator
humphrey's
suggested
amendment
was
not
accepted
by
the
congress.
and
then
senator
estes
kefauver
of
tennessee,
whose
questions
had
been
the
basis
for
most
of
the
debate
as
to
the
effect
of
the
new
bill
on
the
operation
of
the
smith
act,
and
who
had
been
particularly
strong
in
defeating
the
humphrey
version,
stated
near
the
end
of
the
debate.
and
this
is
in
--
on
page
14395
of
the
record.
it
isn't
referred
to
in
our
brief.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin

record.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
14394
and
395.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
of
the
congressional
record.
in
fact,
i
can
give
you
the
exact
--
100
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
100.
14394
and
395.
and
this
reference
is
on
page
14395.
i
have
now
been
assured
that
this,
and
i'm
interpolating
now,
that
was
after
the
humphrey
amendment
was
lost.
this,
referring
to
the
bill,
was
(inaudible)
will
not
adversely
affect
prosecution
under
the
smith
act
or
emasculate
the
internal
security
act,
so
my
principal
objections
have
been
met.
we
think
the
evidence
is
clear,
convincing
of
the
activities
of
the
petitioner
over
a
long
period
of
years
in
the
furtherances
--
furtherance
of
the
purposes
and
objectives
of
the
communist
party
in
this
case.
that
there
were
substantial
acts
including
his
membership
on
this
national
committee
and
his
attending
meetings
described
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner
all
set
forth
in
the
pages
of
our
brief
that
i've
just
referred
to
earlier,
showing
his
participation
in
these
activities
during
the
critical
period.
i
think
that
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed
by
this
court
under
the
evidence.
i
don't
believe
i
answered
your
question,
mr.
justice.
