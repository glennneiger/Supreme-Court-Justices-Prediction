mr.
stephen
ailes
yes,
sir,
it
is.
mr.
stephen
ailes
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
federal
employers'
liability
act
case
here
on
certiorari
from
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
issue
in
the
case
is
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
safety
appliance
act
applies
to
maintenance-of-way
vehicles
used
on
the
railroads
such
as
the
two
which
are
pictured
with
our
brief,
motor
track
car
and
a
push
truck
which
appear
on
last
two
pages
of
our
brief.
specifically,
the
issue
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
these
vehicles
constituting
a
train
when
hits
together
or
whether
the
motor
track
car
on
which
the
workmen
are
riding
constitutes
a
locomotive
engine
as
those
terms
are
used
in
the
safety
appliance
act.
a
question
is
also
involved
whether
or
not
the
push
truck
which
appears
on
the
second
page
is
a
locomotive,
tender,
car,
or
a
similar
vehicle
as
that
--
as
those
terms
are
used
in
section
8
of
the
safety
appliance
act,
so
as
to
require
an
efficient
handbrake
under
section
11.
this
was
a
personal
injury
case
of
course
in
the
lower
court.
the
respondent
had
been
driving
a
vehicle
of
this
character
with
two
other
or
three
other
workmen
on
it,
pulling
a
push
truck
returning
from
a
place
out
near
washington
grove
in
maryland
where
they
had
been
working
on
a
specific
day.
as
they
came
through
a
station,
a
dog
ran
in
front
of
the
motor-car.
a
break
was
applied.
the
car
skidded
in
and
hit
the
dog
and
overturned
and
the
respondent
was
injured.
now,
negligence
was
alleged,
first
on
the
common
law
of
ground
that
the
railroad
should
not
have
permitted
the
respondent
to
be
out
on
a
rainy
day
pulling
a
push
truck
with
no
more
brakes
than
the
brakes
which
were
on
the
motor
track
car.
but
a
second
ground
was
alleged
to
wit
that
the
safety
appliance
act
had
been
violated
because
of
the
fact
that
there
was
no
handbrake
on
the
push
truck,
that
four-wheel
flat
car
that
they
were
towing,
and
because
of
the
second
fact
that
no
train
brake
was
provided
by
which
the
section
foreman
when
he
drove
the
motor
track
car
could
apply
brakes
on
the
car
which
he
was
towing.
mr.
stephen
ailes
yes,
sir.
under
the
act,
they
do.
now,
the
lower
court
instructed
the
jury.
now,
the
other
ground
of
recovery
is
based
upon
an
act
of
congress
known
as
the
safety
appliance
act.
congress
has
required
railroads
to
furnish
certain
equipment
for
use
of
the
operation
of
the
railroad.
among
those
that
are
necessary
as
in
this
particular
case
was
that
the
law
required
the
railroad
to
have
handbrakes
on
this
truck
and
to
have
brakes
on
the
motor-car
controlling
the
brakes
on
both
the
truck
and
the
motor-car.
the
evidence
clearly
showed
and
it
is
admitted
--
it
is
admitted
that
this
equipment
was
not
furnished.
and
you
will
find
therefore
that
if
by
reason
of
the
failure
to
apprise
that
equipment,
this
accident
happened
then
that
was
the
--
that
that
was
the
proximate
cause
or
contributing
cause
of
the
accident,
then
the
railroad
of
course
is
liable
to
the
plaintiff
and
no
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
plaintiff
himself
as
to
bar
to
his
right
of
recovery.
now,
a
verdict
followed
for
the
plaintiff.
the
case
of
course,
this
instruction
went
in
over
the
objection
of
the
--
of
petitioner
here,
motions
for
a
new
trial
on
the
ground
of
the
safety
appliance
act
should
have
been
excluded
from
the
case
were
denied.
the
case
was
reviewed
on
appeal
by
the
court
of
appeals
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
lower
court
was
affirmed.
we
sought
certiorari
here
because
for
64
years,
since
the
passage
of
the
safety
appliance
act,
the
railroads
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission
have
taken
it
absolutely
for
granted
that
the
safety
appliance
act
does
not
apply
to
the
small
maintenance-of-way
vehicles
which
railroads
used
to
haul
workmen
and
tools
to
and
from
stations
to
the
place
of
work
along
the
line.
we
sought
certiorari
because
60,000
or
more
of
these
motor
track
cars
were
in
use
today
and
a
countless
number
of
push
trucks
are
in
use
today,
none
of
which
are
equipped
with
power
brakes
which
section
1
of
the
safety
appliance
act
requires
for
train
brakes
meeting
a
system
by
which
the
lead
or
power
driven
car
can
apply
brakes
on
the
other
vehicles
with
automatic
couplers
which
the
safety
appliance
act
also
requires
with
grab
irons
and
handholds
and
draw-bars,
31
inches
from
the
ground
with
sill
steps
or
with
handbrakes
on
the
push
truck,
all
of
which
would
be
required
as
the
safety
appliance
act
applies.
now,
if
the
lower
court
decision
stands
and
it's
correct,
those
changes
must
be
made
even
though
it
maybe
wholly
impractical
to
do
so,
and
even
though
it
may
actually
increase
hazards
as
distinguished
from
removing
them
because
these
vehicles
as
the
record
show
must
be
removed
from
the
tracks
by
the
crew,
the
section
crew
that
takes
them
out
at
the
place
where
--
where
they
work,
and
they
must
be
removed
in
a
hurry
if
a
regular
train
--
if
they
happen
to
meet
a
regular
train
travelling
along
the
line.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
the
safety
appliance
act
in
terms
does
not
apply
to
these
vehicles
and
was
never
intended
to.
these
vehicles
are
not
trains.
these
vehicles
are
not
used
in
train
service.
they
are
not
used
to
carry
commercial
passengers
or
freight.
they
are
not
operated
by
trainmen
and
railroad
partners.
they
are
operated
by
maintenance-of-way
personnel
who
have
a
separate
brotherhood,
the
brotherhood
of
maintenance-of-way
employees,
and
they've
had
that
brotherhood
since
1887.
the
language
of
the
act
clearly
applies
to
trains
and
refers
to
trains.
section
1
use
these
terms
in
imposing
the
requirements
that
a
power
brake
be
used
on
the
locomotive
and
that
a
train
brake
system
be
used
in
a
train.
it
uses
terms
like
locomotive
engine,
train-brake
system,
train,
engineer,
refers
to
a
locomotive's
drawing
of
train.
it
talks
about
brakemen.
it
talks
about
the
common
handbrake
which
is
common
on
a
freight
car
but
not
on
a
type
of
vehicle
pulled
here.
section
3
of
the
original
act
tells
a
railroad
that
it
may
refuse
to
receive
cars
from
another
connecting
carrier
or
from
shippers.
if
those
cars
are
not
equipped
with
the
necessary
devices,
of
course,
these
maintenance-of-way
vehicles
are
not
exchanged
between
railroad
as
ordinary
freight
cars
are.
section
8
defines
the
coverage
of
this
act
in
terms
of
trains,
locomotives,
tenders,
cars
and
similar
vehicles.
now,
the
respondent
argues
that
these
are
cars
and
since
they
are
cars,
and
so
clearly
cars
that
it
is
useless,
in
fact
improper
to
refer
to
the
legislative
history
in
the
case.
we
say
first
of
all,
it's
perfectly
apparent
from
the
words
used
in
the
act
that
the
act
is
designed
to
refer
--
to
refer
to
trains
and
train
equipment
and
when
it
says
cars,
it
means
train
cars.
but
in
any
event,
we
understand
why
the
respondent
does
not
wish
the
court
to
refer
to
the
legislative
history
for
the
act,
because
nothing
could
be
clearer
when
you
see
the
legislative
history
that
congress
had
no
intention
whatsoever
of
referring
--
requiring
this
equipment
on
anything
but
train
equipment.
here
is
how
the
legislation
came
about
in
the
fist
place.
in
1889
to
1893
--
mr.
stephen
ailes
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
ailes
do
you
mean,
in
--
in
this
act,
sir?
mr.
stephen
ailes
well,
of
course
just
one
was
involved
in
this
case
--
mr.
stephen
ailes
--
to
which
a
motor
track
car
with
one
push
truck
being
towed
by
it.
mr.
stephen
ailes
the
respondent
was
being
an
old
section
foreman.
they
were
returning
home
or
to
the
station
from
the
place
where
they've
been
working
that
day.
two
other
employees,
i
believe
it
was,
were
riding
on
the
car,
the
motor-car
with
him
and
the
tools
which
they
have
used
that
day
were
riding
on
the
push
truck
which
they
were
towing
behind.
mr.
stephen
ailes
not
that
i
know
of
sir
nowadays.
i
think
there
have
been
times
when
they
were
building
railroads
in
the
past.
at
least,
we've
seen
pictures.
i'm
trying
to
look
at
the
history
of
these
vehicles
where
you
saw
more
than
one.
but
so
far
as
i
know,
certainly,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
indicates
that
more
and
one
are
currently
used
today.
the
fact
is
that
the
motor,
which
is
in
the
motor
track
car,
is
not
a
very
heavy
engine.
as
the
record
shows
here,
it's
simply
operated
with
a
hand
clutch,
no
gears
and
a
throttle
and
a
handbrake
and
that's
all
the
equipment
there
is
on.
mr.
stephen
ailes
sir,
the
truck
is
just
a
flat-bedded
truck
as
shown
in
the
picture
and
on
it
coming
home
that
day
were
tools
which
the
workman
had
used.
they
--
they
lay
tools
on
a
motor
car
itself
and
they
also
pile
some
tools
like
shovels
and
picks,
another
tools
that
they
were
using
that
day
on
the
--
on
the
push
truck.
mr.
stephen
ailes
no,
sir.
no,
this
is
a
gasoline-driven
engine.
mr.
stephen
ailes
no,
sir.
they
had
carried
either
coal
or
sand
--
i
now
forget,
going
out
that
morning
--
was
it
coal?
going
out
that
morning.
mr.
stephen
ailes
how
is
it
fastened?
mr.
stephen
ailes
it's
a
link
and
pin
coupler.
no,
sir,
it's
a
simple
link
and
pin
coupler
and
the
picture
on
the
back
shows
a
push
truck
fastened
to
a
motor-car
where
the
bar
was
pinned
through
it.
the
--
i
should
say
that
the
vehicles,
which
are
shown
in
the
picture,
are
not
the
identical
ones
used
and
that
they
were
employed
here.
these
are
pictures
which
were
introduced
in
evidence
and
which
are
identified
by
the
respondent
as
being
vehicles
just
the
same
or
it
was
practically
the
same
as
the
ones
that
had
been
involved
in
the
accident.
mr.
stephen
ailes
well,
mr.
meyer
disagrees
with
me
on
that.
in
the
record,
perhaps,
it's
not
as
clear
as
it
should
be.
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
incidentally,
the
quotations
on
that
subject
all
appear
in
our
reply
to
the
respondent's
opposition
to
our
petition
for
certiorari.
the
respondent
testified
that
this
was
a
usual
way
for
them
to
operate.
we
have
a
stipulation
in
the
case
which
is
the
evidence
of
the
vice
president
of
operations
and
maintenance
for
the
association
of
american
railroads,
and
he
describes
--
he
describes
these
vehicles
and
how
they
are
in
standard
use
on
railroads.
and
he
says
that
the
flat-bed
push
truck
is
a
small
four-wheel
vehicle
capable
of
being
towed
by
a
motor-car.
mr.
stephen
ailes
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
ailes
well,
i
think
they
use
them
for
all
purposes,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
stephen
ailes
no.
well,
you
understand,
when
they
went
out
this
day
and
when
they
came
back
this
day
which
is
certainly
customary
for
this
crew
as
the
--
as
the
respondent
said,
the
motor-car
was
towing
the
push
truck
going
out
the
push
truck
had
coal
on
it.
mr.
stephen
ailes
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
ailes
it
doesn't
have
any.
the
push
truck
itself
has
no
brakes
on
it
at
all.
mr.
stephen
ailes
sir?
mr.
stephen
ailes
i'm
afraid
i
don't
understand
you.
mr.
stephen
ailes
--
push
track.
mr.
stephen
ailes
i
think
that
--
i
have
difficulties
about
the
language.
we
have
been
calling
the
motor-car
--
mr.
stephen
ailes
the
motor
track
car,
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
ailes
it's
called
a
push
--
a
push
truck
as
they
call
it.
mr.
stephen
ailes
because
normally,
the
employee
push
it
by
hand
along
the
railroad
from
place
to
place
and
they
use
it
as
they're
working
along
the
track.
mr.
stephen
ailes
oh,
yes,
sir.
the
--
mr.
stephen
ailes
the
first
one
does.
the
motor-car
has
a
handbrake
system
which
if
you
look
at
the
picture
you'll
see
the
flanges
on
the
wheel.
mr.
stephen
ailes
the
other
one
has
no
brakes
and
it
is
--
and
no
one
has
ever
seen
one
like
this,
so
far
as
i
know,
the
--
in
fact,
the
stipulation
that
describes
these
things
as
in
general
use
says
that
they
simply
do
not
have
brakes
on
them.
stipulation
appears
in
the
record
at
page
77.
mr.
stephen
ailes
the
handcars
--
this
is
called
a
handcar
here
which
is
the
same
as
a
push
truck,
customarily
used
in
the
railroad
industry
in
maintenance-of-way
departments
or
equipments
four
wheels,
two
axels,
wooden
frames
are
capable
of
being
towed
behind
railroad
motor
track
cars
and
are
not
equipped
with
any
kind
of
brakes.
mr.
stephen
ailes
can
attain?
mr.
stephen
ailes
no,
sir.
not
that
i
recall.
they
--
they
were
going
about
five
miles
an
hour
at
the
time
of
this
accident.
i
do
know
that
because
they
just
began.
now,
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
legislative
history
just
for
a
minute.
as
i
said
in
1889
and
1893,
there
was
considerable
agitation
for
legislation
to
solve
two
serious
problems
that
existed
on
the
railroad.
one
was
that
a
great
many
brakemen
were
being
killed
by
being
thrown
from
the
top
of
cars
where
they
had
to
go
in
order
to
set
the
handbrakes
by
which
freight
cars
were
stopped
in
those
days.
the
second
was
that
a
great
many
trainmen
were
being
killed
and
injured
by
being
mashed
between
two
cars
when
they
start
to
go
between
the
car's
coupler.
as
in
railroad
(inaudible)
sometimes
the
deadwood
didn't
meet.
that
meant
that
couplers,
whatever
kind
of
coupler
it
was
failed
to
connect
in
the
two
cars
would
smash
together.
all
of
the
--
well,
let
me
say
this,
an
association
of
railroad
commissioners
throughout
the
state
petitioned
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
so
that
the
brotherhoods
for
action
on
this
subject.
all
the
references
are
to
the
freight
cars.
section
1
of
the
safety
appliance
act
with
section
3
solved
problem
number
one.
it
required
the
air
brake
systems
which
got
the
brakeman
off
to
the
top
of
the
cars.
section
2
and
section
4
and
5
solved
problem
number
two.
it
required
automatic
couplers
which
coupled
on
impact
so
that
no
one
had
to
go
between
the
cars.
but
we
of
course
point
out
that
these
problems
have
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
kind
of
equipment
which
is
involved
in
this
case.
there
isn't
any
way
a
brakeman
can
be
riding
on
top
of
a
car
such
as
our
push
truck.
there
isn't
any
way
that
anybody
can
be
hurt
going
between
these
two
cars
which
are
coupled
by
the
several
process
of
shoving
them
together
by
hand.
in
fact,
the
locomotive,
whether
it's
called
a
locomotive
here,
our
motor
track
car
even
started
as
this
record
shows
by
being
pushed
by
hand.
in
section
--
in
1903,
congress
reviewed
the
question
of
whether
the
coverage
of
vehicles
in
this
legislation
should
be
changed
at
the
request
of
the
brotherhoods
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission
who
had
been
behind
the
previous
legislation.
they
added
the
term
similar
vehicles
here.
actually,
they
added
the
definition,
trains,
locomotives,
tenders,
cars,
and
similar
vehicles,
and
mr.
fuller
who
was
the
union
representative,
who
sought
this
change,
pointed
out
that
he
needed
words
like
"similar
vehicles"
in
here
because
cabooses,
steam
shovels,
snowplows,
scale
cars,
and
similar
conveyances
were
carried
on
trains
and
were
operated
by
a
trainmen.
that
was
important
that
those
vehicles
were
part
of
trains
that
the
same
safeguards
be
provided.
and
needless
to
say,
none
of
these
maintenance
vehicles
are
ever
operated
by
parts
of
trains
in
any
way.
the
second
half
or
really
the
first
half
of
this
instruction
that
--
it
says
that
this
push
truck
must
have
a
handbrake
on
it
as
based
on
section
11
of
the
act
which
was
section
2
of
the
act
of
1910
and
is
codified
in
section
11.
that
act
arose
out
of
convenience
to
standardize
the
various
grab
irons,
handholds,
sill
steps
and
what
not
which
had
been
required
by
the
previous
legislation.
the
president
referred
to
it
in
his
message
to
congress
at
the
time.
the
hearings
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
what
was
involved
was
this.
they
thought
that
these
items
of
equipment
that
the
trainmen
had
began
to
hold
of
to
do
their
work
around
trains
ought
to
be
in
a
standard
location
and
in
standard
size
so
that
you
could
reach
them
automatically
without
having
the
hard
form.
if
you're
working
there
at
night
with
a
bad
light,
you
ought
to
be
able
to
find
what
they
were.
needless
to
say,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
maintenance-of-way
vehicles
again,
which
trainmen
never
see
and
certainly
never
operate
with.
particularly,
the
requirement
of
an
efficient
handbrake
which
is
included
in
section
11
comes
from
this
fact.
congress,
having
required
air
brake
systems,
the
railroads
began
to
let
the
handbrakes
get
in
this
repair
because
they
weren't
needed
in
the
operation
of
the
trains.
yet,
in
switching
operations
in
the
yards,
particularly
in
what
are
known
as
pumping
operations
where
cars
are
backed
up
onto
a
hob
and
led
off
one
by
one
with
the
workmen
riding
the
train
working
the
handbrake,
workmen
were
getting
hurt
because
the
handbrakes
had
been
--
been
allowed
to
get
in
this
repair.
accordingly,
congress
required
each
freight
car,
again,
each
car
under
this
act
to
have
an
efficient
handbrake.
again,
the
hobbing
operation
and
the
switching
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
little
push
truck,
which
is
pushed
around
by
hand
when
it
doesn't
haul
on
the
back
of
a
motor-car.
so
it
is
that
we
say
that
if
you
look
at
the
language
of
the
act
and
if
you
look
at
the
history
of
the
act
and
the
purpose
of
it,
it
is
crystal
clear
that
congress
never
had
any
intention
of
making
this
act
applied
to
the
vehicles
which
are
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
ailes
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
ailes
the
--
the
second
of
that
question,
i
can't
answer.
your
honor,
i
doubt
if
they
do.
i
know
that
the
first
part
is
certainly
correct.
mr.
stephen
ailes
well,
that
might
be.
the
standard
gage
is
pretty
wide
--
mr.
stephen
ailes
--
for
automobile.
i
know
that
they
do
have
the
piggyback
--
mr.
stephen
ailes
--
cars
now
but
those
are
usually
operated
by
trucks,
being
driven
right
on
the
flat
cars.
mr.
stephen
ailes
now,
this
act
also
contains
an
exemption
which
applies
literally
in
terms
to
four-wheel
cars.
it
says
that
four-wheel
cars
are
not
under
it.
we
have
argued
that
point
vigorously
below
without
success
each
time.
the
district
court
held
that
the
exemption
applied
only
to
logging
trains.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
applied
only
to
coal
cars.
the
exemption
specifically
applies
to
four-wheel
cars
and
our
position
is
that
without
doubt,
if
these
are
cars
under
this
act,
they
are
most
certainly
four-wheeled
cars.
mr.
stephen
ailes
not
at
all,
sir.
our
point
is
that
the
first
part
of
it
relates
only
to
--
mr.
stephen
ailes
--
four-wheel
cars
and
the
legislative
history
of
that
is
also
clear
that
first
part
of
that
exclusion
was
in
the
original
act,
and
the
second
part
was
added
in
--
in
1896
and
it
was
really
tagged
on
to
the
end
of
the
first
one.
the
fact
of
matter
is
that
there
were
no
such
things
as
four-wheel
logging
cars,
as
i
understand
it
and
as
i
believe
that
legislative
history
makes
it
clear.
but
our
point
is
that
we
are
exempted
if
we
are
exempted,
not
under
the
logging
exemption
but
under
the
first
part,
which
simply
says
four-wheel
cars
in
which
admittedly
was
put
in
there
for
the
purpose
of
--
of
getting
coal
cars
of
a
certain
type
out
from
under.
mr.
stephen
ailes
yes,
sir,
and
certainly
the
district
court
did.
mr.
stephen
ailes
now,
our
position
of
course
is
that
we
aren't
under
the
act
at
all
but
any
rule
of
construction,
which
brings
us
under,
it
must
get
us
back
out
under
section
6.
now,
just
by
way
of
closing,
i
would
like
to
point
out
just
three
things.
one
is
that
reading
this
act
over,
reading
section
8
which
refers
to
its
coverage
and
section
16
which
refers
to
its
coverage
as
far
as
vehicles
are
concerned,
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
whole
act
applies
or
none
of
it
does.
in
other
words,
congress
was
legislating
with
respect
to
a
type
of
equipment
and
writing
a
series
of
requirements
for
that
type
of
equipment.
it
isn't
possible
to
say
that
a
car
is
under
the
act
for
purposes
of
brakes
but
out
for
purposes
of
couplers
and
back
under
for
purposes
of
grab
irons.
secondly,
that
it
isn't
possible
to
construe
the
act
as
the
lower
court
did
or
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
this
case
and
as
the
florida
court
did
in
martin
versus
johnston
to
hold
that
we
will
simply
lift
the
rule
out
of
this
act
to
decide
a
specific
case,
if
we
think
that
it's
a
good
idea
to
have
the
device
to
meet
safety
needs
we
see
to
solve
this
particular
case.
thirdly,
we
do
say
that
for
64
years,
everyone
interested
in
the
railroad
industry,
the
railroads,
the
associations,
the
brotherhoods
and
the
commission
have
assumed
that
this
act
did
not
apply
and
that
if
it
is
to
be
made
to
apply.
today,
it
ought
to
be
made
to
apply
as
a
result
of
some
study
of
what
the
safety
appliance
in
this
industry
really
are
and
some
assurance
rather
than
what
this
type
of
record
will
ever
disclose
as
to
what
the
needs
are.
thank
you.
