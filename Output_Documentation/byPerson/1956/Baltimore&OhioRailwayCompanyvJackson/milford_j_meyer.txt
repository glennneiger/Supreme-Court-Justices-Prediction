mr.
milford
j.
meyer
may
it
please
the
court.
with
the
last
statement
made
by
mr.
ailes,
i'm
in
complete
agreement.
i'm
in
agreement
with
nothing
else
that
he
said
in
argument
of
this
case.
the
first
point
that
we
have
made
in
our
brief
and
which
i
urge
on
the
court
and
the
few
minutes
left
to
me
this
afternoon
is
that
the
writ
in
this
case
was
improvidently
granted
and
should
be
dismissed.
the
matter
which
has
been
argued
by
mr.
ailes
here
and
which
appears
in
extent
so
in
his
brief
is
not
the
question
that
was
before
the
courts
below,
and
was
not
the
question
presented
to
this
court
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
and
we
have
set
that
out
very
clearly
in
the
opening
pages
of
our
brief.
this,
which
began
as
a
very
simple
issue
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
between
a
then
70-year
old
negro
employee
of
the
baltimore
&
ohio
railroad
and
the
railroad
because
of
an
accident
that
might
happen
any
day
to
the
man
that
--
or
tell
to
use
these
vehicles
on
the
railroad
has
now
grown
in
the
argument
before
this
court
into
a
cause
which
according
to
the
baltimore
&
ohio
becomes
of
momentous
interest
to
the
railroad
interest
throughout
the
country.
as
interested
as
i
am,
as
a
lawyer,
in
the
establishment
of
fundamental
railroad
law
as
mr.
jackson's
attorney
in
this
case,
i
am
frankly,
your
honors,
interested
only
in
the
decision
of
this
case.
now,
the
issue
presented
below
three
times
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
and
on
appeal
before
the
court
of
appeals
for
this
--
of
this
circuit
was
whether
the
section
6
exemption
applied
to
these
vehicles
and
nothing
else.
and
it
was
as
clear
as
anything
could
be
that
the
section
6
exemption
does
not
apply
whether
it
be
read
as
language
of
a
statute
that
is
handed
to
us
without
any
background
or
whether
as
the
courts
below
in
trying
to
read
out
or
read
some
sense
into
the
legislative
history
how
to
construe
it
in
either
way.
it
cannot
possibly
apply
to
these
vehicles.
your
honors
will
find
as
we
get
into
a
consideration
of
this
history
of
the
section
6
exemption
and
its
amendment
that
instead
of
trying
to
analyze
the
meaning
of
the
words
we
get
into
what
justice
jackson
once
called,
as
i
recall
it,
the
psychoanalysis
of
the
congress
because
the
1896
congress
had
no
idea
what
the
1893
congress
was
talking
about
when
it
first
adopted
this
proviso
and
the
1896
congress
was
the
one
that
amended
the
proviso.
mr.
milford
j.
meyer
the
construction
of
the
proviso
was
the
only
question
below,
yes,
sir.
mr.
milford
j.
meyer
i
think
not,
sir,
because
there
--
there
has
never
been
any
question
about
it
in
this
court.
this
court
has
twice
--
mr.
milford
j.
meyer
yes,
sir,
and
--
and
it
was
represented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
that
there
was
a
conflict.
mr.
milford
j.
meyer
and
i
--
i
--
mr.
milford
j.
meyer
i
--
i
firmly
believe
that
--
that
your
honors
felt
upon
reading
the
petition
that
there
might
have
been
some
conflict,
but
i
think
as
your
honors
review
the
case,
you'll
find
that
there
is
absolutely
no
conflict.
mr.
milford
j.
meyer
of
the
--
mr.
milford
j.
meyer
i
--
i
don't
think
so,
sir.
i
thought
your
honors
will
--
will
find
that
it
has
been
ruled
upon
in
every
page
consistently.
this
court
has
said,
"although
it's
--
i
concede
as
a
matter
of
dicta
that
the
section
6
exemption
does
not
apply,"
and
the
courts
of
appeals
have
said
so.
and
this
court
of
course,
the
refusal
of
certiorari,
i
realized
it
means
nothing
as
your
honors
have
frequently
said.
but
this
court,
20
years
ago,
refused
certiorari
in
exactly
this
type
of
case
where
the
second
circuit
had
held
that
the
section
6
exemption
did
not
apply
to
these
vehicles
and
last
year
from
the
supreme
court
of
florida
in
the
case
of
a
motor
track
car,
your
--
your
honors
refused
certiorari
again
on
the
basis
of
the
second
--
the
section
6
exemption
not
applied.
so
that
i
would
like
your
honors
to
consider
this
first
question
which
we
raised
as
to
whether
or
not
this
broad
question
which
the
railroad
now
raises
before
your
honors
should
be
considered
at
all
in
this
case.
