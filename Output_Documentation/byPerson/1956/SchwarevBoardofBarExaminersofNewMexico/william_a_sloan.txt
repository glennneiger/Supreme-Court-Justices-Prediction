mr.
william
a.
sloan
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
review
of
a
finding
of
fact
made
by
a
state
supreme
court.
the
manner,
in
which
the
procedure
in
which
the
finding
of
fact
was
made,
was
not
a
typical
lawsuit.
it
was
not
an
adversary
proceeding
and
issues
weren't
framed,
and
the
decision
was
not
very
much
like
that
in
an
ordinary
common
law
action.
the
procedure
is
that
the
--
that
a
--
an
applicant
applies
for
admission
to
the
bar.
there
is
a
--
no
contrary
pleading,
no
issue
made
up
and
the
applicant
comes
to
the
committee
for
the
purpose
of
satisfying
the
committee,
that
--
that
he
has
the
requisite,
moral
character.
the
committee
makes
a
determination
on
that
in
the
absence
of
anything
in
the
nature
of
issues.
after
the
determination
was
made
in
this
particular
case,
the
committee
decided
adversely
to
the
petitioner
and
advised
him
of
it.
subsequently,
he
asked
for
a
hearing
and
again,
a
hearing
was
held
without
any
further
documentary
alignment
of
the
issues
and
the
determination
was
reaffirmed.
then,
he
petitioned
for
review
to
the
supreme
court
of
new
mexico.
now,
the
supreme
court
of
new
mexico
in
this
case
has
decided
what
the
procedure
in
the
case
should
be.
there
was
no
rule
or
statute
that
established
the
procedure
and
the
procedure
appears
to
be
a
petition
for
review.
to
that
petition,
the
bar
examiners
filed
a
response.
and
in
that
response,
there
were
admissions
made
concerning
the
truth
of
the
matters
that
were
testified
to
and
the
matters
that
were
stated
in
the
application.
now,
it
is
a
fact
that
those
are
in
the
record.
actually,
those
admissions
were
disregarded
in
the
subsequent
hearing
before
the
court
and
they
did
not
fulfill
the
function
of
pleadings
in
a
normal
case.
ordinary
pleadings
fix
the
issues
in
advance
of
a
hearing
and
as
a
consequence
of
that
notice
is
given
to
the
litigant
that
there
--
as
to
the
issue
as
to
which
he
will
present
evidence.
the
response
that
was
filed
in
this
case
was
not
a
notice
in
advance
of
hearing.
it
was
a
notice
after
all
the
evidence
had
been
received,
and
the
admission
in
those
circumstances
was
not
considered
by
the
supreme
court
in
the
manner
that
counsel
has
tried
to
use
it
in
his
argument
here
as
in
effect
changing
the
rule
of
law,
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
a
petitioner
to
establish
his
moral
character.
now,
this
is
a
matter.
i
submit
that
it's
a
matter
of
a
law
of
new
mexico
and
the
manner
in
which
the
state
of
new
mexico
supreme
court
addressed
itself
to
this
problem.
i
submit
it's
the
procedural
framework
on
which
this
court
should
also
decide
it.
and
our
supreme
court
held
and
its
holding
is
not
at
all
unusual
or
different
from
that
in
other
jurisdictions,
that
the
--
that
by
applying
for
membership
in
the
bar,
an
applicant
thereby
places
his
moral
character
in
issue.
and
thereby,
submits
himself
to
a
burden
of
persuasion,
not
a
burden
of
going
forward
but
the
burden
of
persuasion
in
a
broad
sense
of
satisfying
the
bar
examiners
that
he
has
a
good
moral
character.
now,
that
particular
issue
has
been
decided
adversely.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
yes.
i
understand
that.
the
determination
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
mexico
is
best
stated
in
the
last
page
of
the
original
opinion.
it
says
that
it
had
for
determination
before
it
the
question
of
whether
the
court
had
a
conviction
that
the
plaintiff
or
the
petitioner
was
of
good
moral
character,
and
they
found
that
they
did
not
hold
that
conviction.
so,
the
--
the
determination
of
the
supreme
court
boldly
stated
is
that
they
did
not
consider
that
the
petitioner
had
satisfied
the
burden
of
persuading
them
of
good
moral
character.
now,
the
question
i
submit
before
this
court
is,
was
that
determination
by
the
supreme
court
of
new
mexico
wrong
as
a
matter
of
law?
that
is
an
answer
to
your
question,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
well,
i
think
that
the
bases
of
the
court's
decision
are
clear
from
the
opinion
of
the
court.
and
i
think
those
bases
in
all
fairness
include
four
particular
things.
the
court
considered
that
being
a
member
of
the
communist
party
in
the
circumstances
of
this
particular
case
and
evidence
was
something
from
which
an
adverse
interest
--
inference
touching
moral
character
could
be
drawn.
secondly,
that
the
history
of
the
use
of
aliases
by
this
particular
petitioner
was
something
from
which
adverse
inferences
could
be
drawn.
thirdly,
that
the
record
of
arrests
without
prosecution
or
conviction
in
these
circumstances
of
this
particular
case
was
something
from
which
an
adverse
inference
could
be
drawn.
and
finally,
that
portions
of
the
petitioner's
account
of
himself
as
expressed
in
the
application
and
in
the
--
in
the
evidence
he
gave
before
the
bar
examiners
also,
and
taking
all
of
those
things
together
and
not
relying
on
one
or
the
other.
and
i
might
say
not
trying
to
ensure
that
only
orthodox
people
become
members
of
the
bar.
the
supreme
court
of
new
mexico
found
that
it
was
not
satisfied
of
the
moral
character
of
the
applicant
and
determined
that
he
--
the
action
of
the
bar
examiners
in
not
permitting
him
to
take
the
bar
was
warranted
by
our
law.
now,
that
--
mr.
william
a.
sloan
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
yes,
sir.
i
would
think
that
is
true.
in
other
words,
i
would
think
that
if
any
one
of
those
grounds
was
an
unconstitutional
ground,
an
improper
inference,
then
it
would
be
appropriate
for
this
court
to
review
it
and
so
hold.
i
have
--
mr.
william
a.
sloan
yes.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
well
--
mr.
william
a.
sloan
it's
like
a
court
making
a
finding
of
fact
on
erroneous
legal
principles.
you'd
still
--
you'd
still
be
bound,
i
think,
to
--
as
an
appellate
court
and
here
an
appellate
court
on
constitutional
matters,
i
think
the
court
would
be
bound
to
consider
if
that
is
--
if
any
of
the
inferences
on
which
the
court
relied
was
an
unconstitutional
inference.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
yes.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
yes.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
yes.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
i
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
now,
i
have
begun
in
my
argument
on
making
the
point
that
the
posture
of
the
pleadings
as
relied
upon
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner
really
was
not
as
strong
or
didn't
--
didn't
warrant
his
claim.
under
the
law
of
new
mexico
as
determined
by
the
new
mexico
supreme
court,
those
admissions
in
our
response
to
the
--
to
the
petition
for
review
filed
in
the
court
did
not
limit
the
issues
and
changed
the
burden
of
proof.
and
i
think
that
by
answering
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
questions,
i
have
covered
the
next
matter
that
i
intended
to
cover,
to
wit
the
nature
of
the
controversy
that
is
before
this
court
for
determination.
now,
i
might
say
in
passing
just
to
point
out
the
fact
that
the
pleadings
as
relied
on
by
counsel
are
not
so
important,
is
that
the
original
pleading
which
is
filed
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
the
--
the
petition
for
review
contained
many
matters
which
are
not
now
in
consideration,
including
a
claim
that
the
standard
of
good
moral
character
which
is
applied
in
new
mexico
is
unconstitutionally
vague
and
void
for
that
reason.
that
has
been
abandoned.
a
number
of
things
have
happened,
in
other
words,
since
the
pleadings
were
filed
which
do
pinpoint
the
issue
in
the
manner
of
which
i
have
told
the
court
in
response
to
judge
frankfurter's
questions.
now,
it
is
important
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
petitioner
at
all
times
and
that
it
is
the
burden
of
persuading
the
fact
finder
of
the
truth
of
his
position.
that
particular
burden
results
in
--
in
part
from
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
there
was
no
evidence
introduced
against
the
petitioner
in
this
case.counsel
has
mentioned
that
several
times.
from
the
nature
of
the
inquiry,
there
ordinarily
is
not
an
inference
from
that
circumstance.
it's
not
permissible
that
there
was
something
else
behind
the
door
or
under
the
table
that
they
looked
at.
the
--
the
burden,
having
placed
the
--
his
character
in
issue
in
the
manner
stated
by
the
court,
having
applied
for
admission
to
the
bar,
he
assumes
the
burden
of
demonstrating
his
good
moral
character.
and
adverse
proof
is
not
necessary
and
under
the
law
of
new
mexico,
and
i
think
under
general
law,
a
party
having
the
burden
of
proof
is
ordinarily
not
entitled
to
insist
on
the
belief
of
his
testimony
if
there
is
any
rational
basis
for
questioning
it.
now,
the
effect
of
--
mr.
william
a.
sloan
in
the
opinion
itself,
your
honor,
there
is
not
a
statement
to
that
effect.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
how
--
well,
there
are
things
that
reflect
upon
the
credibility
of
the
witness,
which
the
court
mentioned.
the
court
did
mention
the
fact
that
he
had
given
inconsistent
accounts
of
the
reason
why
he
first
adopted
an
alias.
the
court
mentioned
that
in
the
opinion
and
i
take
it
that
that
was
some
reflection
on
his
credibility.
i
think
also
that
the
court
was
referring
to
that
in
a
statement
that
the
court
made
to
the
effect
that
it
--
that
his
general
attitude
towards
these
several
matters,
which
were
under
--
under
discussion,
reflected
an
improper
present
attitude
as
distinguished
from
improper
past
conduct.
i
think
that
while
it
isn't
spelled
out
like
findings
and
rulings,
it
is
an
opinion
of
the
court
and
perhaps
is
cryptical.i
do
think
that
the
court
did
have
reference
to
that,
yes,
sir.
now,
the
--
it
is
the
position
of
the
respondent
in
this
case
that
the
fact
finder,
the
--
the
bar
examiners
first
as
the
recommender
to
the
court
and
the
state
--
and
the
state
supreme
court
of
new
mexico
was
not
bound
to
accept
his
testimony.
particularly,
he
was
not
bound
to
believe
all
the
exculpatory
things
and
all
the
inferences
from
exculpatory
things
that
he
said.
if
that
is
not
appreciated
and
if
the
approach
is
not
of
that
kind,
is
not
kept
in
mind,
the
effect
of
it
is
to
--
the
effect
of
that
procedure,
which
is
what
the
petitioner
in
this
case
suggest
to
this
court,
would
be
substantially
to
reverse
the
true
rule
of
law
and
to
place
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
bar
examiners
and
on
the
state
authorities
to
demonstrate
lack
of
moral
character.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
i
would
think
that
that
would
not
be
allowable
because
i
think
that
that
--
that
there
ought
to
be
something
in
the
record.
now,
i
am
--
i
believe
that
it
isn't
necessary
to
do
that
in
this
case.
you
have
the
burden
of
proof
and
he
has
to
satisfy
the
court
of
his
good
moral
character.
and
i
believe
that
in
entertaining
the
dubiety
that
they
had
concerning
his
character,
that
something
of
that
kind
may
have
entered
into
their
thinking.
they
don't
--
do
not
spell
it
out
in
the
opinion,
but
it
was
one
of
the
things.
the
--
the
end
conclusion
of
the
court
was
that
they
were
not
satisfied
of
his
good
moral
character.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
i
think
that
i
would
--
mr.
william
a.
sloan
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
well,
i
would
certainly
do
so
in
reviewing
this
evidence.
i
think
that
is
only
fair,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
if
that
were
the
ruling
of
this
court,
it
is
clear
that
our
supreme
court
gave
evidentiary
and
legal
weigh
to
that
circumstance
in
evaluating
the
man's
moral
character.
and
if
you
cannot
make
an
inference
from
communist
party
membership
to
moral
dubiety,
i
do
think
that
--
that
that
would
require
a
reversal
and
remand
of
the
case
for
further
consideration.
the
court
unquestionably
did
consider
that
matter
and
it
is
my
position
that
that
inference
is
permissible
and
that
an
inference
of
that
kind
does
not
at
all
violate
--
mr.
william
a.
sloan
i
don't
really
--
mr.
william
a.
sloan
--
know
how
that
works.
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
i
would
certainly
think
that
it
would
be
like
an
erroneous
ruling
of
law
by
a
court
in
the
course
of
finding
a
fact
and
i
think
it
would
officiate
it.
i
mean,
that
would
be
--
mr.
william
a.
sloan
i
suppose
that
if
the
court
wanted
to
put
the
decision
on
that
ground
and
that
alone,
that
it
would
be
free
to
do
so,
yes.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
is
correct.
now,
it
is
--
as
i
have
already
stated
to
the
court,
the
court
did
give
value,
evidentiary
value
to
the
matter
of
communist
party
membership
and
we
believe
that
considering
the
nature
of
the
communist
party,
the
nature
of
the
congressional
findings
on
the
communist
party,
the
nature
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
relating
to
the
communist
party,
that
adverse
moral
inferences
can
be
drawn
from
membership
in
the
communist
party,
particularly
on
the
two
grounds
of
truthfulness
and
loyalty,
those
two
particular
grounds.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
those
are
matters
that
are
relevant
to
the
office
of
an
attorney.
i
think
that
a
state
which
protects
itself
from
disloyal
or
untruthful
attorneys,
and
makes
loyalty
and
truthfulness
a
measure
of
the
power
of
--
a
measure
of
admissibility
is
doing
nothing
forbidden
by
the
due
process
clause.
now,
there
are
--
there
had
been
some
comparisons
made
here
between
this,
and
ex
parte
garland,
and
missouri
versus
cummings.
i
do
not
think
that
those
cases
present
the
same
kind
of
moral
issue
that
the
present
case
presents.
i
think
that
in
ex
parte
cummings
and
in
--
in
missouri
versus
cummings
and
ex
parte
garland,
essentially,
the
offense
which
was
proscribed
and
for
which
the
test
oath
was
adopted
was
adherence
to
the
southern
cause.
the
form
of
words
here
in
question,
good
moral
character
was
not
even
used
in
that
case.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
well,
if
they
had
and
the
only
proof
of
good
moral
character
was
adherence
to
the
southern
cause,
then
i
would
say
that
the
use
of
its
--
of
the
term,
good
moral
character
would
not
have
made
--
made
constitutional
what
otherwise
would
have
been
unconstitutional.
in
other
words,
that
adherence
to
the
southern
cause
could
not
be
a
basis
of
an
inference
of
immorality.
and
i
want
to
make
that
quite
clear,
i
regard
this
as
a
different
type
of
case.
in
--
in
respect
to
the
difference
between
adherence
to
the
southern
side
in
the
civil
war
and
adherence
to
modern
communism,
i
think
they're
utterly
different.
and
i
think
that
adherence
to
communism
presents
moral
issues
as
distinguished
from
political
allegiances.
i
think
they
are
quite
different,
and
for
that
reason,
i
see
no
particular
trouble
for
the
respondent
in
this
case
from
ex
parte
garland
and
in
re
cummings.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
cummings.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
yes,
sir,
that
is
true.
but
in
the
discussion
of
those
two
cases,
there
has
been
a
general
tendency
to
treat
them
as
though
they
arose
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
they
--
they
actually
were
decided
before
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
they
are
used
more
or
less
as
a
guide
to
what
is
due
process
of
law
in
subsequent
decisions.
it
is
a
fact
though
that
cummings
versus
missouri
largely
related
to
the
ex
post
facto
prohibition
in
the
constitution
and
garland
related
to
the
bill
of
attainder
prohibition
in
the
constitution.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
well,
i
think
it
would
be
an
ex
post
facto
law.
yes,
sir?
mr.
william
a.
sloan
well,
i
think
there
is
quite
a
difference,
your
honor,
because
of
the
fact
the
question
in
this
case
the
rule
of
law
has
not
been
changed
at
all
during
the
course
of
this
entire
matter.
during
the
life
of
mr.
schware
and
for
a
long
time,
it
has
been
the
requirement
for
admission
to
the
bar
in
new
mexico
and
47
other
states
that
a
person
have
a
good
moral
character.
now,
the
fact
that
you
could
not
impose
a
punishment
or
that
the
communist
party
is
or
has
been
lawful
in
new
mexico
and
there
have
been
actually
candidates
who
filed
and
ran
in
elections
in
--
in
new
mexico
during
the
period
that
mr.
schware
was
a
communist
although
he
was
not
in
new
mexico
at
that
time.
that
fact
does
not,
to
my
pegging,
remove
the
possibility
of
relevant
inferences
as
to
moral
character,
truly
moral
character,
not
political
character,
not
religious
or
economic
character
but
strictly
moral
character.
i
think
that
that
coupled
with
the
other
evidence
in
this
case
and
not
as
a
matter
of
adopting
of
a
rule,
of
general
or
special
application
that
permits
inferences
to
be
drawn.
now
--
mr.
william
a.
sloan
yes.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
who
had
been
a
member.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
well,
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
william
a.
sloan
i
would
say
that
the
inquiry
in
the
case
of
the
lawyer
is
as
to
whether
he
has
good
moral
character,
not
the
quality
particularly
of
the
naacp
and
that
an
inference
from
mere
naacp
membership
to
lack
of
moral
character
or
doubt
of
moral
character,
which
is
more
correctly
the
question
here
would
be
improper.
in
the
fact
that
13
states
did
so
--
mr.
william
a.
sloan
well,
if
the
naacp
were
of
a
different
nature
and
it
was
so
found
by
court
to
be
then
i
understand
it
to
be,
then
i
would
say
that
you
could
make
the
inference.
as
soon
as
it
becomes
conspiratorial
enough,
dishonest
enough
and
disloyal
enough
then
maybe
you
can,
at
that
point,
draw
an
adverse
interest
--
inference.
it's
hard
for
me
to
consider
the
naacp
as
a
sinister
organization
as
i
do
regard
the
communist
party
as
a
sinister
organization.
with
respect
to
the
--
mr.
william
a.
sloan
yes,
i
likely
would
not
find
it.
i
don't
have
to
agree
with
a
legislature.
now
--
mr.
william
a.
sloan
of
course
not.
and
your
honor,
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
i
am
not
arguing
that
we
must
decide
this
case
in
the
way
that
we
have
because
congress
has
done
so.
and
because
congress
has
made
these
findings
concerning
the
nature
of
the
communist
party
of
this
court
and
its
judges
have
made
these
findings,
the
adverse
is
true.
i
am
saying
that
if
this
court
can
make
the
inference
from
communism
to
the
kind
of
a
conduct
that
has
been
recited
in
the
douds
case
and
in
the
dennis
case
and
so
on.
and
if
congress
can
make
findings
that
comprise
pages
of
the
statutes
to
the
effect
that
the
communist
party
is
a
conspiracy
of
disloyalty
and
dishonesty,
then
i
believe
that
the
bar
examiners
of
new
mexico
and
the
supreme
court
of
new
mexico
can
make
a
light
inference.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
because
some
of
your
thinking,
i
believe,
was
in
the
minds
of
the
bar
examiners.
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
william
a.
sloan
--
that
the
real
thing
was
that
they
weren't
satisfied
that
he
was
of
good
moral
character.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
they
--
mr.
william
a.
sloan
oh,
no.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
no,
i
--
i
didn't
understand
what
you
meant
by
the
term
“undesirable,”
your
honor.
i
do
not
think
that
our
bar
examiners
for
one
minute
would
--
would
keep
a
man
out
for
personal
reasons.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
well
--
mr.
william
a.
sloan
i
think
something
--
mr.
william
a.
sloan
i
--
i
think
something
of
that
kind
may
have
been
in
their
minds,
your
honor,
but
i
still
believe
that
our
bar
examiners
and
our
court
actually
registered
judicially
in
their
minds
that
they
were
not
satisfied
with
the
man's
good
moral
character.
and
our
rule
has
provided
for
years
that
when
they
are
not
satisfied
of
good
moral
character,
they
will
not
permit
the
individual
to
take
the
exam.
now,
the
other
matters
that
the
court
relied
upon
in
the
course
of
its
decision
and
i
should
make
the
point
that
the
function
of
the
bar
examiners
as
such
is
recommendatory
only.
they
neither
admit
to
the
bar
nor
do
they
refuse
to
admit
to
the
bar
in
a
final
sense
and
i
might
add
that
they
do
not
disbar
lawyers
in
new
mexico.
all
of
those
functions
are
reserved
to
the
supreme
court
of
new
mexico.
the
--
the
other
matters
that
were
discussed
by
the
court
are
the
use
of
aliases,
the
--
and
the
record
of
arrests,
and
certain
discrepancies
and
omissions.
now,
these
matters
are
covered
in
our
brief
and
we
believe
that
they
are
material.we
think
that
anybody
who
was
admitting
any
person
to
an
employment
or
a
position
would
take
into
consideration
and
would
give
evidentiary
weight
to
such
conduct
as
that
admitted
by
the
petitioner
here.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
i
think
not,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
the
lawyers
in
spain?
mr.
william
a.
sloan
no,
i'm
sure
--
mr.
william
a.
sloan
i'm
sure
that
they
did
not.
they
didn't
mention
that
and
i
don't
quite
understand
your
question.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
well,
he
was
charged
with
violation
of
the
neutrality
act
and
in
connection
with
that,
he
--
it
is
his
oral
testimony
that
he
violated
the
act
without
realizing
that
he
was
doing
so.
he
says
that
he
did
--
mr.
william
a.
sloan
well,
by
recruiting
--
recruiting
soldiers
for
the
--
the
loyalist
side
in
spain.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
yes.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
that
was
--
that
was
the
conduct
which
was
claimed
to
comprise
a
violation.
there
is
a
discussion
in
the
--
in
the
opinions
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
in
fact
a
violation,
which
i
think
is
rather
beside
the
point.
i
don't,
i
don't
think
it
is
too
material
whether
it
was
a
violation
or
not.
the
--
the
court
--
the
court
did
consider
those
arrests
and
the
conduct
that
led
up
to
the
arrest
as
something
from
which
an
inference
of
adverse
to
the
petitioner
could
be
drawn.
now,
in
that
connection,
i
want
to
point
out
two
things.
first
of
all,
he
said
that
he
didn't
know
that
he
was
violating
the
law
whether
he
was
or
not,
he
did
say
that.
in
addition
to
that,
he
also
said
that
his
work
in
--
in
recruiting
for
the
abraham
lincoln
brigade
was
conducted
by
the
--
on
behalf
of
the
communist
party
and
that
his
actions
relating
to
these
arrests
were
the
result
of
activity
on
behalf
of
the
communist
party.
now,
i
think
that
all
of
those
things
are
relevant
in
determining
the
nature
of
his
communist
party
membership
and
whether
or
not
he
had
the
scienter
which
counsel
told
this
court
there
was
no
evidence
of.
and
they
are
further
relevant
to
whether
or
not
he
was
telling
the
truth
at
the
time
he
appeared
before
the
bar
examiners.
the
bar
examiners
are
reasonably
sophisticated.
i
am
sure
that
they
have
some
misgivings
as
to
whether
a
person,
enlisting
or
recruiting
for
the
abraham
lincoln
brigade
on
behalf
of
the
communist
party
knew
what
the
law
of
the
united
states
touching
recruiting
laws.
i'm
sure
that
the
bar
examiners
regarded
that
as
a
circumstance
which
they
could
evaluate
in
reaching
their
general
notion
that
they
were
dubious
of
his
moral
character.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
well,
of
course
not.
the
arrest
for
--
mr.
william
a.
sloan
well,
i
think
that
the
arrest
for
stolen
car
on
his
version
of
it
and
we
have
no
other
facts
that
it
was
taken,
the
arrest
relating
for
stolen
car
was
just
a
completely
innocent
occurrence.
now,
i
think
that
while
a
person
could
quite
properly
have
sympathies
with
the
loyalist
side
in
spain,
i
may
say
that
i
have,
rather
ardent
ones
myself,
i
think
that
is
different
from
recruiting
--
recruiting
soldiers
for
--
as
a
part
of
--
for
the
abraham
lincoln
brigade
as
a
part
of
your
communist
activity.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
william
a.
sloan
well,
he
--
mr.
william
a.
sloan
well,
i
think,
your
honor
that
is
the
reason
that
i
want
to
emphasize
that
the
burden
of
proof
was
on
him.
the
burden
of
persuasion
was
on
him.
i
think
it
was
up
to
him
to
explain
the
circumstances.
the
only
thing
that
we
know
about
his
arrest
in
connection
with
an
indictment
for
violation
of
the
neutrality
act
was
that
he
was
doing
that
work
he
says
himself
as
part
of
his
communist
party
activity
and
was
governed
by
their
instructions.
that's
all
we
know
about
it.
he
did
not
offer
any
explanation
as
to
what
particular
conduct
he
had
done.
it
can
only
be
gained
here
and
there
through
the
record.
he
did
not
say
what
he
had
done
and
i
do
not
think
that
in
those
circumstances,
the
inferences
that
can
be
drawn
are
entirely
exculpatory.
i
think
that
you
can,
considering
the
fact
that
the
burden
was
on
him
to
come
forward
and
explain
these
things
in
an
exculpatory
manner.
i
think
the
supreme
court
in
that
state
of
the
record
is
entitled
to
draw
adverse
inferences
from
the
lack
of
proof,
instead
of
being
under
duty
--
mr.
william
a.
sloan
what's
that?
mr.
william
a.
sloan
i
didn't
hear
what
you
said.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
it
was
dismissed
by
no
cause
shortly
after
it
--
he
was
arrested
on
the
indictment
according
to
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
well,
it
may
have
been.
actually,
it
was
received
in
evidence
and
considered.
i
do
not
think
that
he
gave
a
very
good
explanation
of
the
conduct
that
adopted
it.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
35.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
all
right.
i
don't
think
that
a
--
that
a
no-cross
wipes
out
the
possible
adverse
inferences
that
you
can
draw
upon
an
arrest
by
authority
of
the
united
states
in
this
case
and
an
explanation
that
was
no
more
detailed
than
the
one
he
offered.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
well,
i
think
--
mr.
william
a.
sloan
yes.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
oh,
no.
no,
sir.
i
do
think
that
the
fact
that
it
was
a
part
of
the
performance
of
his
communist
duties.
colors,
it's
somewhat
over
a
near
sympathy.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
yes.
i
think
it
does
in
a
measure.
and
i
do
think
that
--
mr.
william
a.
sloan
as
i
read
the
statute,
now,
there
seems
to
be
some
nice
legal
points
on
that
which
i
have
never
really
spelled
out.
but
i
believe
that
his
statement
as
to
what
he
did
amounted
to
an
admission
that
he
had
violated
the
law
of
the
united
states.
and
again,
the
court
did
not
say,
the
supreme
court
of
new
mexico
did
not
say
that
by
reason
of
that,
he
was
excluded
from
the
bar.
they
took
it
into
consideration
along
with
other
things
and
concluded
that
they
had
doubts
about
his
moral
character,
partly
as
a
consequence
of
that.
and
i
believe
that
taking
into
consideration,
an
arrest
or
a
number
of
arrests
in
the
manner
the
court
did
is
something
that
people
do
everyday
and
i
believe
it
is
within
the
realm
of
permissible
state
action
to
do
so.
his
explanation
of
his
arrest
in
california,
which
were
a
factor
in
his
case
which
were
--
was
decided
upon
by
the
court,
amounted
to
dismissing
the
california
statute
against
an
offense
called
criminal
syndicalism
as
though
it
just
wasn't
fair.
it
amount
to
saying
that
it
was
perfectly
all
right
to
get
arrested
in
california
if
it
was
in
connection
with
a
waterfront
strike
and
arrested
on
a
number
of
occasions
and
on
ascertained
number
of
occasions.
and
it
also
amounted
to
saying
that
this
was
true
even
though
the
conduct
leading
up
to
the
arrests
had
been
conduct
directed
by
and
in
aid
of
the
communist
party.
now
--
mr.
william
a.
sloan
he
had
been
living
under
an
alias
at
that
time,
judge
clark,
and
had
given
an
additional
alias.
in
other
words,
he
was
--
his
true
name
was
schware.
he
had
been
living
under
the
name
de
caprio,
rudy
de
caprio,
and
when
arrested,
he
gave
the
name
joe
fleari
or
joe
fleori.
and
he
stated
in
exculpation
on
that
that
he
gained
nothing
by
giving
the
police
an
erroneous
name.
i
should
like
to
--
mr.
william
a.
sloan
well,
with
respect
to
that,
he
stated
that
he
--
that
he
could
not
remember
which
name
he
had
used
in
the
party.
that
was
another
circumstance
in
this
case
--
mr.
william
a.
sloan
no,
he
said
that
he
did
not
use
his
real
name
in
the
party,
but
he
couldn't
remember
which
name
he
had
used
during
the
six
years
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
party.
he
couldn't
remember
whether
he
had
used
the
name
de
caprio
or
fleori.
it
was
one
or
the
other
and
he
could
not
remember
which,
and
that
was
a
statement
he
made
at
the
second
hearing
and
is
in
the
record,
and
i
think
reflects
something
on
his
credibility.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
he
said
that
he
used
one
or
the
other
and
he
could
not
remember
which
while
in
the
communist
party.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
well,
he
was
speaking
there,
i
think
of
the
continuous
period
during
which
he
was
in
the
communist
party,
and
he
said
that
he
couldn't
remember
what
name
he
had
used
in
the
party.
i
don't
think
he
meant
in
applying
in
the
party.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
well,
the
bad
inference
is
--
mr.
william
a.
sloan
--
that
a
person
--
mr.
william
a.
sloan
yes.
well,
it
is
very
often
true
on
cross-examination
that
a
witness
gives
an
unsatisfactory
answer
on
answers
vaguely.
and
the
bad
inferences
from
the
vagueness,
the
fact
that
he
could
have
thought
up
something
better
to
say
does
not
detract
from
the
inference
--
from
the
bad
inference
that
you
--
mr.
william
a.
sloan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
not
at
all.
but
if
asked
for
an
explanation
as
to
which
of
two
names
he
used
during
his
six
or
more
years
of
membership
in
the
communist
party,
and
he
said,
“i
don't
remember.
i
used
one
or
the
other,
i
don't
remember
which.”
i
think
that
that
answer
is
from
a
fact
find
as
you
point,
unsatisfactory.
it
is
not
specific
enough.
i
think
that
it
is
a
reasonable
inference
that
for
--
whatever
his
reason,
he
didn't
answer
the
question
truthfully.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
that's
true.
i
think
that
when
you're
questioning
a
witness,
he
gives
wrong
answer
sometimes
because
he
isn't
telling
the
truth
and
can't
think
of
a
better
way
out
of
its
difficulty.
and
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
you
gain
by
cross-examination.
you
don't
have
to
--
i
don't
think
you
have
to
think
of
it,
of
a
guilty
explanation
of
every
--
of
every
unsatisfactory
answer
the
man
gave
on
cross-examination.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
i
--
i
--
mr.
william
a.
sloan
i
see.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
[laughs]
i
might
--
mr.
william
a.
sloan
well,
i'm
sure
they
did
not.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
yes,
sir,
they
--
mr.
william
a.
sloan
to
give
a
completely
direct
and
complete
account
of
the
record.
i
think
that
they
portrayed
the
whole
thing.
they
didn't
know
a
purport
to
make
that
a
ratio
decidendi
at
all.
i'm
sure
that
they
did
not.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
on
the
arrest.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
no
question
about
that.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
they
did
not,
of
course
--
mr.
william
a.
sloan
the
--
the
bar
examiners
made
absolutely
no
contention
touching
that.
they
did
not
claim
in
the
argument
before
the
supreme
court
that
there
was
anything
discreditable
about
that
and
at
no
time
has
any
claim
been
made
of
that
kind.
i'm
sure
the
court
did
not
in
fact
do
so.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
there
--
that
was
really
to
be
covered
by
the
--
by
the
attorney
general.
however
--
mr.
william
a.
sloan
--
the
answer
is
that
they
did
not
reach
their
decision
on
the
basis
of
confidential
--
mr.
william
a.
sloan
they
--
they
stated
that
their
decision
was
not
motivated
in
any
way
by
the
confidential
information.
that
is
their
statement
and
the
court
didn't
even
look
at
it
and
the
court
considered
the
matter
up
fresh.
did
you
have
a
question,
your
honor?
mr.
william
a.
sloan
that
is
correct.
they
did
not.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
and
the
--
mr.
william
a.
sloan
yes,
and
the
determination
of
--
mr.
william
a.
sloan
yes,
sir,
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
no.
actually,
he
applied
in
this
particular
manner
before
the
supreme
court
and
the
matter
was
argued
on
the
record.
after
the
supreme
--
the
original
supreme
court
opinion
came
out
then
he
applied
to
the
court
on
rehearing
for
a
leave
to
appear
before
the
court.
and
that
request
was
denied
along
with
the
rehearing,
but
he
got
originally,
the
exactly
the
kind
of
a
hearing
before
the
supreme
court
of
new
mexico
as
he
asked
for.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
yes.
that
is
--
that
was
required.
mr.
william
a.
sloan
there
is
no
--
well
--
he
did
disclose
all
the
aliases
that
appear
in
the
record
and
he
says
that
he
used
one
of
them
in
the
communist
party.
he
did
not
particularly
say
which
one
he
used
in
the
communist
party.
he
did
not
mention
the
communist
party
in
his
application.
however,
there
was
no
question
specifically
addressed
to
membership
in
the
communist
party
and
therefore,
he
didn't
--
it
wasn't
called
for
by
the
questions.
the
whole
application
is
printed
in
the
--
in
the
record,
your
honor.
i
--
i
would
like
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
a.
sloan
--
mr.
standley
use
the
remaining
time.
