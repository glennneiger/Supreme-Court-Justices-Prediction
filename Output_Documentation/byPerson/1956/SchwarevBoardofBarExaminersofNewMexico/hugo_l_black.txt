justice
hugo
l.
black
are
they
any
different
than
your
argument
whether
he's
duped
or
not
duped
on
your
constitutional
points?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
in
the
hypothetical
case
mr.
justice
frankfurter
used
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you
would
also
probably
have
to
call
the
(inaudible)
problem
as
to
whether
you
could
take
away
a
lawyer's
right
to
practice
for
that
some
kind
of
judicial
review.
whether
it
would
call
the
quoted
petition
or
not
of
some
kind,
whatever
it
is,
it
means
due
process
of
law
if
it
stood
some
kind
of
judicial
action
and
supervision.
i
guess
you'd
have
that
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
the
only
way
you
can
determine
what
standards
they
used
to
see
what
language
they
used?
justice
hugo
l.
black
wouldn't
you
also
determine
it
by
what
they
did
on
the
evidence
that
was
before
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
in
a
negligence
case
was
mentioned
which
is
rather
difficult
to
draw
closer
now,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
the
only
evidence
was
that
the
man
was
negligent
because
he
belonged
to
one
church
instead
of
another,
they
relied
on
that
entirely,
nothing
else
went
in
except
that
he
belonged
to
one
church
and
it
was
a
hotly
contested
issue
on
that,
and
was
said
that
he
was
guilty
of
negligence
because
he
belonged
to
that
church?
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
the
standard
there
would
be
pretty
clearly
shown
by
the
evidence
that
was
introduced
in
the
finding
of
the
jury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
there
is
one
page
of
your
argument
here
that
i'm
not
sure
about.
there's
one
page
of
your
argument
that
rest
on
the
premise.
the
record
as
a
whole
shows
that
this
man
was
excluded
from
the
practice
of
law
substantially
because
it
would
not
have
been
but
he
belonged
to
the
communist
party
at
the
time
when
it
was
legal
for
him
to
belong
to
the
communist
party
in
the
state
of
new
mexico?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
that
phase
of
the
case,
does
the
garland
case
have
anything
to
do
with
it,
ex
parte
garland?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
that
case,
as
i
recall
it,
the
theory
was
not
that
he
believed
in
revolution
but
that
he
engaged
in
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
evidence
that
he
did?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
there
have
been
any
difference
you
suppose,
the
holding
in
the
garland
case
if
instead
of
saying
they
were
--
disbarred
him
because
he
did
engaged
in
a
rebellion.
they
had
found
that
because
he
did
engage
in
the
rebellion,
that
made
him
have
a
bad
character,
a
mark
bad
moral
character?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
indication
in
the
opinion
that
the
result
could
have
been
changed
by
putting
it
on
the
standard
of
good
moral
character,
rather
than
the
fact
that
he
was
engaged
in
rebellion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
that
--
if
it'd
be
--
if
you
accept
the
premise
--
i
don't
know
whether
it
should
be
or
not,
i'm
not
saying
it
should,
but
if
the
premise
be
accepted
that
a
man
could
not
be
barred
from
the
practice
of
law,
wholly
because
he
engaged
in
rebellion
because
that
was
not
the
rule
at
the
time
he
engaged
in
the
rebellion,
do
you
accept
that?
can
the
effect
that
he
did
engage
in
a
rebellion
or
didn't
believe
in
a
rebellion
be
used
as
a
partial
support
for
disbarring
him
on
the
ground
that
he
had
bear
part
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
suppose
there
are
millions
of
people
in
the
united
states
that
thought
that
a
man
who
engaged
in
rebellion,
because
of
rebellion,
some
people
have
a
mindset
they
could
think
of,
if
whatever
it
was,
i
suppose
there
were
millions
who
did
think
that
all
the
people
who
engaged
in
that
were
of
bad
moral
character.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
necessarily
follows
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
if
one
is
judged
by
that
standard,
can
one
assume
that
that
is
always
the
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
require
him
here
to
make
an
oath
that
he
had
not
belonged
to
the
communist
party
like
you
just
said?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
he
had
since
there
was
nothing
illegal
about
what
he
did
so
that
he
had
to
ask
for
a
pardon,
what
would
have
been
the
difference
between
that
case
and
the
garland
case,
which
i
rhetoric?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
recall.
had
the
priest
also
been
pardoned
in
that
case,
the
other
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
probably
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
agree
with
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
might
indicate
in
the
court
to
live
a
different
approach.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
think
it's
illegal
if
you
mention
what
you're
saying,
it
might
be
undesirable.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
go
to
that
figure
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
suppose
--
suppose
it
should
be
thought
that
the
court
or
the
state
was
without
authority
to
keep
a
man
out
of
the
bar
or
to
put
him
out
of
the
bar
because
he
hadn't
belong
to
the
communist
party
back
in
the
time
when
it
was
legal.
what
in
your
judgment
would
that
dispose
of
the
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
had?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
cummings
against
missouri
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
was
largely
based
on
the
fact
that
it
was
an
ex
post
facto
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
that
your
state
--
sort
of
--
that
might
had
that
provided
that
while
it
was
just
stated
in
an
act,
i
thought
it
was
not
illegal
to
belong
to
the
communist
party,
it
was
not
accord
for
disbarring
or
preventing
from
being
a
member
of
the
bar
in
1942,
for
a
man
to
be
a
communist
in
1942.
nevertheless,
legislature
hereby
enacted
that
any
man
who
did
belong
to
the
communist
party
in
1942,
when
it
was
legal,
could
be
denied
the
practice
of
law.
what
would
then
be
your
line
of
distinction?
why
--
why
wouldn't
that
be
an
ex
post
facto
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
--
you
draw
the
line
and
that
you
say
that
you
authorized
the
crime
to
be
immoral
of
that
character
belonging
to
the
communist
party
but
it
couldn't
be
found
because
they
belong
to
the
southern
confederates.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
rely
for
that
on
--
i
gather
that
you
rely
from
the
fact
that
there
had
been
legislative
declarations
and
judicial
declarations
that
the
communist
party
was
a
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap).
well,
i
suppose
13
states
ought
to
determine
to
their
legislatures
and
their
supreme
courts
that
the
naacp
was
disloyal,
that
it
wanted
to
subvert
the
states,
the
13
states
and
that
was
to
declare
the
truth.
and
that
the
lawyer
should
go
before
state
--
applicants
should
go
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
the
bar
and
file,
and
they
showed
nothing
except
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
naacp.
what
would
you
say
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
entered
in
the
time
it
was
legal.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
the
legislature
declared
they
did
found
it
and
the
court
declared
that
they
did
found
it
that
it's
also
was
engaged
in
a
conspiracy.
suppose
the
court
had
found
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
--
if
the
legislatures
had
declared
that
and
the
court
had
found
that
they
were
officers
who
were
in
conspiracy,
you
--
you
--
could
you
still
say
that
you
would
--
wouldn't
find
it
a
sinister
organization?
justice
hugo
l.
black
neither
does
a
court
in
any
aspects,
does
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
rely
to
any
extent
on
the
fact
that
disconnection
of
some
kind
with
the
loyalist
in
spain
to
the
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
you
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
lawyer,
that
he
was
sympathetic
with
the
loyalists
in
spain.
justice
hugo
l.
black
during
the
spanish
revolution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
are
the
--
what
was
this
neutrality
act
that
he
violated?
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
doing
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
happened
to
the
charge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
happened
to
the
charge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
happened
to
the
charge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
wasn't
that
a
pretty
good
exculpatory
statement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
anything
peculiar
--
peculiar
about
that
kind
of
charge
that
somebody
was
interested
in
--
in
the
one
side
and
wanted
to
help
him
and
try
to
help
him
get
some
people.
is
there
anything
in
that
--
doing
that,
that
according
to
the
general
standards
of
good
moral
character
would
be
thought
pretty
generally
that
would
reflect
on
a
man's
good
moral
character?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
haven't
thought
of
it
in
that
way.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
like
steven,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
--
that
gets
back
to
the
communist
question
of
the
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
plan
that
he
had
used
one
or
the
other?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
then
--
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
advantage
could
he
possibly
have
obtained
in
his
bar
association
business
by
--
if
he
didn't
remember
which
name
he'd
used,
since
both
of
them
were
assumed?
what
possible
good
did
he
have
done
to
himself
or
what
possible
hurt
could
he
done
to
the
other
side
by
telling
them
to
use
one
or
the
other,
he
didn't
know
which?
i
don't
quite
get
your
bad
inference
from
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
quite
a
different
name?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
but
what
i
was
getting
at
was
if
that
if
there's
anything
wrong
with
using
the
alias,
he
swore
that
he'd
used
the
alias,
did
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
there
have
been
any
worse
scene,
or
wrong,
or
immoral
conduct
to
use
the
name
fleori
or
whatever
it
is
rather
than
the
other
name?
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
--
just
for
the
pure
pleasure
of
not
telling
the
truth,
do
you
think
maybe
he
gave
them
one
bad
alias
instead
of
another
bad
alias?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
just
thinking
about
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
including
a
bad
answer.
maybe
you
have
to
assume
that
he's
untruthful
in
undoing
it.
i
was
really
thinking
about
an
article
written
many
years
ago
by
a
man
who
used
to
be
a
judge
in
the
supreme
court
of
california
who
lived
in
alabama
when
he
wrote
it,
that
(inaudible),
written
and
found
for
the
first
time
in
mississippi
and
alabama.
that's
the
reason
i
was
interested
with
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
idea
of
why
you
would
think
he
can
get
an
advantage
in
doing
one
or
the
other
and
why
he
couldn't
get
an
advantage,
maybe
it
was
just
for
the
pure
pleasure
of
not
telling
the
truth.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
other
reason?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
only
one
other
question
that
i'm
left
in
doubt
of
a
little
by
this
opinion.
now,
you
could
tell
me.
did
the
bar
examiners
utilized
and
read
how
far
consideration
in
connection
of
what
they
did,
so-called
confidential
information
about
which
no
information
was
given
to
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
consider
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
did
they
say
this
and
where?
did
they
say
it
before
they
reached
their
conclusion
to
deny
him
the
right
to
practice
law
or
did
they
say
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
findings?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
--
i
don't
remember.
i
was
just
--
