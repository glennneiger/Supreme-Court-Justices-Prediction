john
m.
harlan
as
to
the
point
of
information.
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
did
the
information
that
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
get
to
the
bar
committee,
prior
to
the
second
hearing
or
prior
to
the
only
hearing
that
they
gave
him
after
their
first
ruling?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
not
in
the
record
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
not.
i'm
just
curious.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
the
committee
had
articulated
its
grounds
in
this
fashion,
point
one,
we
agree
that
past
membership
in
a
communist
party
does
not
foreclose
this
man
from
certification
but
on
the
basis
of
the
record
and
the
impression
that
he
has
made
on
us,
etcetera.
we're
not
satisfied
that
he
still
does
not
adhere
to
--
to
believe
that
the
government
should
be
overthrown
by
force
and
violence,
assuming
that
he's
made
those
findings.
what
would
you
say
of
your
case
on
this
record?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
would
the
constitutional
issue
be
then?
justice
john
m.
harlan
not
satisfied
that
he
did
not
believe
in
the
forcible
overthrow
of
the
government.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
sir.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
sir.
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
there
anything
said
by
your
court
that
indicated
that
they
ruled
against
him
on
the
question
of
his
credibility?
i
didn't
see
anything
of
that
kind.
justice
john
m.
harlan
nothing
at
all?
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
you
say
that
it
was
a
fair
characterization
of
the
new
mexico
court's
decision?
that
they
in
fact
said,
“well,
here's
a
fellow
that
has
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
for
seven
years.
he's
used
aliases.
he'd
been
arrested.
he
seems
to
have
been
a
wandering
sort
of
a
fellow
and
really
all
that
adds
up
to
his
being
a
man
as
an
undesirable
member
of
the
bar
because
where
there
is
so
much
smoke,
there
may
be
some
fire,
you
know.”
and
they
asked
you
preliminarily
whether
you
don't
think
that
is
--
it
comes
pretty
close
or
isn't
it
an
accurate
rationale
of
this
decision.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
if
you
take
that
interpretation
in
the
proceeding,
do
you
think
that
adds
up
to
a
finding
of
lack
of
moral
character?
justice
john
m.
harlan
distinguish
from
a
man
who
is
just
undesirable
kind
of
man
to
have
in.
that
isn't
the
text
under
your
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
statute,
is
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
there
wasn't
anything
personal
about
it.
they
say
this
man
has
a
two-checkered
career
to
make
a
satisfactory
member
of
the
bar.
there's
nothing
personal
about
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
our
bar
is
entitled
to
have
something
more
than
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
a
man
who
had
this
checkered
kind
of
a
career.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
just
want
to
ask
you
whether
i'm
correct
in
understanding
that
this
schware
did
not
appear
before
the
supreme
court.
they
didn't
see
him,
did
they?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
that
their
judgment
on
his
moral
qualification
is
based
on
the
reading
of
the
record
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
entirely.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
the
determination
of
the
committee?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no
suggestion
that
he
was
concealing
it
in
any
way.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
it
couldn't
have
been
very
serious
because
the
only
--
this
member
of
the
court
who
had
read
it
is
judge
kiker,
and
judge
kiker
was
the
only
dissenting
member
of
the
court,
so
it
couldn't
have
been
very
damaging.
