mr.
herbert
monte
levy
your
honor,
may
it
please
the
court.
i,
of
course,
i
think
may
not
go
into
the
broad
particular
questions
that
are
presented
here
since
this
court
knows
very
well
why
i
had
placed
the
case
on
the
calendar
immediately
following
here
in
express.
the
crucial
difference
of
course
is
that
the
schware
case
involves
what
happens
to
the
man
after
he
makes
answer
to
the
inquiries
which
had
been
made
of
him.
in
fact,
there's
one
step
further.
this
man
never
had
any
inquiries
made
of
him
in
regard
to
a
number
of
the
facts
which
he
disclosed.
the
first
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
because
i
think
so,
yes.
i
would
say,
sir,
that
the
crucial
point
here
is
that
there
is
really
no
question
of
burden
of
proof
involved.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
there's
no
question
of
burden
of
proof
involved.
the
court
below
relied
entirely
upon
the
fact
that
schware
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
from
1934
to
1940,
together
with
what
they
called
his
former
actions
in
the
use
of
aliases
and
what
they
termed
his
record
of
arrest
and
his
attitudes
there
are.
this
was
the
only
point
upon
which
they
based
their
decision.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
1934
to
1940.
now,
schware
presented
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no,
the
court
itself
talks
in
terms
of
past
membership
throughout.
the
bar
examiners,
the
board
of
bar
examiners
talked
in
terms
of
past
membership.
the
only
thing
that
is
brought
up
to
cast
any
doubt
is
in
terms
of
when
he
left
the
party
with
that
particular
1944
letter,
which
is
read
in
the
1955
context.
i
don't
know
whether
i
should
get
into
that
particular
problem
now
but
i
suppose
i
might
as
well.
the
only
point
that
was
made
in
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
i
think
that's
the
most
that
they
could
assume.
now,
i
do
want
to
point
out
again
that
there
is
really
no
controversy
over
the
facts
here
or
no
question
of
burden
of
proof.
because
in
the
petition
to
review
the
denial
of
schware's
application,
the
statement
is
made
that
all
the
questions
that
were
asked
in
the
application
length
and
at
the
first
hearing
were
answered
correctly.
and
more
importantly,
beginning
in
pages
90
through
92,
a
defendant
board
admits
or
rather
refuses
to
deny
any
complete
truthfulness
and
so
forth
in
the
matters
that
schware
testified
to.
they
say
that
while
they
cannot
admit
or
deny
the
completeness
and
the
truthfulness
and
so
on,
they
have
not
made
any
claim
that
petitioner
answered
any
questions
in
his
application
other
than
fully
and
accurately,
nor
is
the
respondent's
decision
in
the
petitioner's
case
based
upon
any
such
claim.
they
make
the
same
statement
again
in
reference
to
the
hearing
at
the
paragraph
ending
just
before
number
seven
on
page
91.
and
again,
on
page
92,
it
is
said
very
clearly
at
the
end
of
paragraph
number
10
that
the
decision
of
the
respondent
in
the
petitioner's
case
is
based
upon
facts
disclosed
by
the
petitioner
himself.
so
that
i
think
here
we
have
no
question
of
veracity,
no
question
of
burden
of
proof
and
the
simple
issue
in
the
case
is
whether
the
three
factors
has
communist
party
membership
in
the
popular
front
period
from
1934
to
1940,
the
use
of
aliases
for
the
particular
reasons
set
forth
here
and
the
mere
fact
that
this
man
had
been
arrested
without
any
consideration
again
as
to
whether
he
was
guilty
or
innocent
of
crimes,
whether
these
three
factors
can
constitutionally
be
the
basis
for
a
decision
barring
him
from
taking
the
bar
examination.
i
see
that
i
have
about
30
seconds
left
and
i
think
this
might
be
the
point
which
the
chief
justice
might
want
to
adjourn.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
i
hope
i
was
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
thank
you,
your
honor.
yesterday,
in
the
four
minutes
that
i
had
to
argue,
i
attempted
to
establish
that
there
was
no
question
here
actually
of
burden
of
proof
in
terms
of
the
petitioner's
showing
of
his
good
moral
character
that
he
made
below.
i
would
like
to
begin
today
by
stressing
the
affirmative
proof
in
relation
to
the
petitioner
that
was
given
by
him.
the
first
and
perhaps
the
most
cogent
point
is
that
this
man
was
a
dupe
of
the
communist
party,
who
is
duped
into
joining
the
party
in
1934
and
left
it
in
1940
when
he
began
to
learn
what
it
was
all
about.
i
think
a
special
stress
must
be
laid
upon
the
fact
that
he
testified
without
contradiction,
without
any
doubt
manifested
anywhere
else,
that
after
he
left
the
party,
he
went
to
the
fbi
to
be
of
assistance
to
them
in
the
fight
against
communism.
in
other
words,
we
have
the
picture
of
a
man
who
has
been
an
anti-communist
for
at
least
a
decade
who
is
now
barred
from
admission
to
the
bar
of
a
court.
among
other
reasons,
i
would
say
mainly,
because
of
his
past
membership
in
the
communist
party.
i
think
it
also
deserves
note
that
this
man
voluntarily
admitted
that
he
had
once
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
going
to
the
dean
of
the
law
school,
admitting
it
to
him
in
the
very
beginning
without
any
request
therefore.
i
think
it
should
also
be
noted
that
he
led
an
honorable
life
in
the
army
of
the
united
states
and
received
an
honorable
discharge.
i
think
it
should
further
be
noted
in
regard
to
what
the
respondent
in
terms
of
discrepancy
in
a
number
of
arrests
that
he
had
undergone
in
california,
that
this
man
made
a
trip
halfway
across
the
country
to
california
to
find
out
exactly
what
the
situation
was
as
shown
by
the
records
in
california.
i
think
it
is
also
worthy
of
note
that
this
man
presented
not
merely
testimonials
and
affidavits
and
letters,
but
also
presented
live
witnesses
including
the
rabbi
of
this
orthodox
jewish
synagogue,
who
testified
as
to
his
very
high
opinion
of
the
petitioner.
he
presented
the
dean's
secretary,
who
knew
him
fairly
intimately,
she
said.
and
she
testified
too
as
to
her
very
high
opinion.
and
the
blind
student,
whom
schware
had
helped
in
law
school
over
and
above
the
call
of
duty,
also
testified
as
to
his
fine
moral
character.
this
is
in
addition
to
the
other
point
such
as
his
conversion
to
religion,
his
establishing
an
anonymous
scholarship
for
indigent
students
at
the
law
school,
letters
of
recommendation
from
virtually
everybody
there,
etcetera,
etcetera.
in
terms,
again,
of
the
letters
that
he
presented
showing
his
high
moral
character,
the
respondent
has
raised
some
questions
as
to
the
lack
of
enthusiasm,
so-called
lack
of
enthusiasm
in
some
of
the
letters
which
was
submitted.
however,
in
other
letters,
which
he
of
course
does
not
advert
to,
i'm
referring
now
to
page
85
of
the
record,
we
find
one
person,
mr.
martinez
testifying
that,
“schware's
moral
character
in
my
opinion
is
far
and
beyond
the
highest
standard
of
any
person
i
have
ever
come
in
contact
with.”
and
then,
on
the
next
page
86
at
the
bottom,
another
person
testifies
that
schware
is
a
person
of
the
highest
and
best
moral
character.
and
at
the
bottom
of
87,
another
person
testifies,
“that
i
know
mr.
schware
to
be
open-handed
charitable
towards
others
and
scrupulously
honest
in
every
situation.
were
he
to
represent
me,
i
should
have
every
confidence
in
his
integrity.”
and
again,
on
page
88,
another
person
says
in
the
center
of
the
page,
“that
i
find
him
trustworthy,
honest
and
his
character
to
my
estimation
is
above
reproach.”
so
that
i
think
we
have
here
a
case
where
whatever
burden
of
proof
there
may
have
been
as
to
his
good
moral
character,
mr.
schware
has
sustained
it
more
than
admirably
if
ever
there
was
a
--
shall
i
call
it
a
super
prima
facie
case,
i
think
this
was
it.
the
record
also
shows
that
mr.
schware
had
been
an
idealist
all
his
life,
that
he
joined
the
party
for
idealistic
reasons.
but
when
he
found
that
this
god
had
failed
him,
so
many
others
had
found
in
the
past,
he
left
the
party.
he
himself
was
the
person
who
furnished
all
the
derogatory
information
against
him.
he
concealed
nothing.
he
refused
to
answer
no
question.
i
think
it's
also
worthy
of
note
that
exactly
the
same
decision
in
regard
to
his
case
was
made
by
the
board
of
bar
examiners
before
and
after
mr.
schware
introduced
his
affirmative
evidence.
in
other
words,
the
affirmative
evidence
apparently
had
no
effect.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
at
all
to
show
that
anywhere
in
his
whole
life
had
mr.
schware
ever
done
anything
indicating
bad
moral
character.
from
my
examination
of
the
record,
i
think
i
can
state
that
he
had
never
violated
the
code
of
honesty,
the
code
of
morality,
or
the
code
of
good
social
conduct.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
well,
this
of
course
is
a
matter
of
some
conjecture.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
it
doesn't
appear
on
the
record.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes.
i
would
imagine
that
this
was
part
of
the
confidential
information
that
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
--
they
have
received
about
schware.
actually,
the
burden
of
proof
question
is
not
really
in
the
case.
it's
really
a
question
of
the
standards
they
used.
the
court
said
at
page
109
that
its
standard
was
of
good
moral
character
and
i
quote
now
from
the
top
of
the
page.
“they
must
consider
two
kinds
of
indirect
evidence.
first,
the
pattern
of
conduct
an
individual
follows.
and
second,
the
consideration
of
the
regard
his
fellows
and
associates
have
for
him.”
as
to
the
pattern
of
conduct
an
individual
follows,
using
the
present
tense,
there
is
nothing
which
anyone
could
and
i
am
sure
there
is
nothing
that
the
respondents
contend,
which
had
been
reprehensible
during
the
15
years
prior
to
the
application
for
admission.
the
court
actually
just
adverted
very
briefly
in
one-half
of
a
page
to
this
very
fine
record
that
mr.
schware
have
had
and
they
nowhere
has
related
it
to
his
present
moral
character.
in
regard
to
the
second
standard
that
they
used,
the
consideration
of
the
regard
his
fellows
and
associates
have
for
him,
at
page
125,
the
court
said
and
i
quote
from
the
last
paragraph.
“the
record
on
which
this
--
second
sentence,
“the
record
on
which
this
decision
is
based
came
from
the
petitioner
himself,
who
presently
enjoys
good
repute
among
his
teachers,
his
fellow
students,
and
associates
and
in
his
synagogue.”
so
that
is
to
the
second
criterion
that
the
court
used
below,
they
obviously
--
schware
had
sustained
that
burden
of
proof.
as
to
the
pattern
of
conduct
he
follows,
the
court
nowhere
has
considered
the
conduct
of
the
past
15
years
and
rested
its
decision
entirely
upon
the
basis
of
pre-1940
conduct.
the
burden
of
proof,
by
the
way,
is
mentioned
aside
from
that
--
the
use
of
the
word
on
page
190
--
109,
comes
up
again
only
at
pages
126,
which
is
the
tail
end
of
the
first
opinion.
and
again,
in
page
150,
in
both
of
those
cases,
they
took
the
question
of
good
moral
character
is
related
solely
to
the
question
of
past
membership
in
the
communist
party
and
use
of
aliases,
and
the
fact
that
there
had
been
arrest.
there
is
no
question
raised
anywhere
as
in
the
opinion
as
to
good
moral
character
in
any
other
way,
shape,
or
form.
the
testimony,
i
think
i
showed
yesterday
of
the
petitioner
and
his
witnesses
was
all
accepted.
there
was
no
question
raised.
the
only
discrepancies
that
were
mentioned
at
all
was
the
fact
that
he
had
given
an
additional
reason
for
using
an
alias
at
one
particular
point,
plus
the
fact
that
schware
could
not
account
for
his
addresses
and
employments
during
a
particular
period
about
20
years
previously.
and
though
the
court
adverted
to
that,
they
did
not
rely
upon
that
at
all.
they
said
that
were
it
not
--
they
said
that
this
would
be
devoid
of
explanation
where
it
not
for
the
fact
that
schware
led
such
a
peripatetic
existence.
but
having
led
that
existence,
they
felt
there
was
certainly
a
reason
explaining
why
he
could
not
account
for
these
particular
times.
i
might
also
add
that
--
or
reiterate
perhaps
that
the
failure,
the
inability
to
account
for
certain
periods
of
time
with
regard
to
employment
and
addresses
was
mentioned
in
schware's
application
blank.
and
again,
to
mention
again
what
i
said
yesterday,
the
respondent
said
that
at
no
time
had
they
ever
raised
the
contention
that
schware's
answers
were
anything
but
full,
true
and
complete.
as
they
say,
to
quote
it
again
on
page
90,
“respondent
has
not
made
any
claim.
the
petitioner
answered
any
questions
in
his
applications
other
than
fully
and
accurately,
nor
is
the
respondent's
decision
in
the
petitioner's
case
based
upon
any
such
claim,
nor
was
the
decision
below
based
on
any
such
claim,"
i
might
add.
the
only
question
before
this
court
then,
i
think,
is
quite
clearly,
the
three
standards
that
were
used.
as
to
the
first
standard,
the
question
of
membership
in
the
communist
party,
this
i
think
is
central.
i
think
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
use
of
aliases
and
the
fact
of
arrest
had
been
disclosed
in
the
application
to
take
the
bar
examination.
despite
that
disclosure,
we
find
that
the
petitioner
was
advised
that
he
was
entitled
to
take
the
bar
examination.that
is
alleged
in
paragraph
(4)
on
page
1
of
this
record
in
the
petition
to
review.
and
that
paragraph
is
specifically
admitted
on
page
90,
paragraph
(5)
of
the
response
to
the
petition,
that
he
had
been
advised
that
he
was
entitled
to
take
the
bar
examination.
my
opponent
--
opponents
say
that
he
had
merely
been
told
to
report
for
an
examination,
but
again,
the
record
stands
very
clear
here
that
he
was
entitled
to
take
the
bar
examination,
that
he
had
been
so
advised.
and
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no,
i'm
not
saying
that
there
is
an
estoppel,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
i
think
the
point
of
that
is
to
show
the
centrality
of
this
issue
that
the
case
rested
upon
that.
and
that
--
but
for
the
past
communist
party
membership,
this
man
would
have
clearly
been
admitted
to
the
bar,
which
i
think
may
be
of
assistance
to
the
court
in
framing
its
order.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no,
but
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
take
it.
i
shouldn't
have
said
that
he
would
--
that
he
should
have
been
admitted.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
right,
just
the
reversal
here.
now,
again,
the
court
below
here
specifically
conceded
that
membership
in
the
communist
party
at
the
time
of
schware's
membership
was
legal,
nor
do
i
know
myself
of
any
illegality
of
the
communist
party
in
any
other
states
during
which
schware
was
in
the
period
from
1934
to
1940.
the
court
never
below
quite
spelled
out
precisely
what
it
was,
about
the
communist
party
that
made
membership
in
it
something
that
that
was
revolting.
they,
in
effect,
dealt
with
some
vague
generalized
immorality
that
they
felt
existed
in
the
communist
party
without
referring
at
all
to
any
illegality.
now,
of
course,
there
might
have
been
some
immorality
in
the
party
but
what
they
are
doing
essentially
below,
i
think,
is
to
make
a
political
judgment
in
saying
that
this
party
was
bad.
they
also
failed
to
take
into
account
the
nature
of
the
party
in
the
period
during
which
respondent
was
a
member
of
it.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
today?
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
i
would
say
that
if
a
present
member
of
the
clan
comes
up
before
them
today,
i
would
say
that
the
mere
membership
would
not
be
a
sufficient
ground
that
they
would
have
to
show
either
that
this
man
participate
--
would
have
to
show
where
the
man
might
have
to
demonstrate
either
that
there
was
no
participation
in
illegal
activities,
or
that
he
didn't
know
of
them,
or
that
he
was
a
dupe
of
the
clan.
that's
a
little
harder
to
imagine
than
a
dupe
of
the
communist
party.
but
again,
i
think
that
there
would
be
a
requirement
or
some
proof
of
that
sort.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no,
i
don't
think
you
could
not.
i
don't
think
you
could,
sir.
but
again,
here,
i'm
not
asking
that
because
here,
the
facts
were
uncontradicted
and
there
was
no
question
raised
as
to
whether
he
had
been
into
the
--
been
brought
into
the
party
as
a
matter
of
idealism.
he
testified
after
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
well
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no,
being
a
dupe
means
having
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no,
being
dupe
means
having
idealistic
motives
and
being
persuaded
to
take
the
wrong
methods
of
expressing
those
motives
and
those
ideas
here
by
joining
the
communist
party.
i
say
he
was
duped
into
it
because
he
thought
that
it
was
a
fine
thing,
which
of
course
was
quite
untrue
as
he
later
came
to
learn.
but
his
essential
reason,
the
thing
that
permitted
him
to
be
duped
was
that
he
was
an
idealist.
as
to
again,
i
think
it
quite
clear
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
i
think
the
fact
that
he
was
duped
makes
the
argument
perhaps
more
a
little
stronger,
but
i
think
essentially,
there
is
no
difference.
i
think
even
if
he
had
joined
the
party,
knowing
what
it
was,
which
he
didn't.
and
even
if
he
had
remained
a
member
of
it
until
1940
or
even
1944
knowing
what
it
was,
i
still
think
the
decision
below
is
constitutionally
incorrect,
because
it
gave
no
attention
to
the
period
of
time
after
the
membership
and
judged
entirely
on
the
basis
of
the
past.
it
judged
present
moral
characters
as
if
it
was
judging
past
moral
character,
which
i
think
again
falls
afoul
of
the
rule
of
this
court
in
cole
v.
arkansas.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
the
only
way
they
could
find
out,
sir.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes,
sir,
i
would
say
they
could
inquire
into
it.
and
they
did
here
below.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
right.
that's
yesterday's
problem.
[laughs]
the
respondent
--
well,
again,
here
our
problem
isn't
even
a
question
of
whether
a
knowing
member
of
the
communist
party
from
1934
to
1940
could
be
excluded
from
admission
to
the
bar
because
there
wasn't
any
knowledge
of
any
evil
parts
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes,
there
was
cross-examination
on
that.
for
example,
at
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes,
it
may,
sir.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
it
may.
we
have
at
the
bottom
on
page
46,
where
he
was
questioned.
“suppose
the
ruler
of
russia
today
would
to
be
overthrown
to
the
--
to
be
overthrown
into
the
eyes
of
the
communist,
the
control
of
the
communist
party
was
restored
to
sincere
communist,
those
that
believe
in
principles
of
communism,
that
condition
existed.
do
you
still
believe
in
those
principles
to
the
extent
that
you
would
again
join
the
communist
party?”
answer,
“never.
never.”
and
then,
a
bit
below,
“i
am
saying,
judge,
that
for
myself,
i
would
never
join
the
communist
party.
i
would
never
join
the
communist
party.”
but
there
was
a
question
as
to
when
he
had
ceased
believing
in
all
communist
principles,
which
by
the
way
was
never
quite
clearly
defined
whether
some
of
the
innocent
names
of
the
party
were
included
in
this,
whether
this
what
schware
meant,
one
can't
quite
tell
from
the
record.
and
he
does
frankly
admit
that
his
disillusionment
with
all
the
principles
of
communism,
which
i'll
call
principles,
took
a
few
more
years
to
bring
about,
which
is
of
course,
the
history
of
almost
every
person
who
has
ever
been
in
and
left
the
communist
party.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no,
sir.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes.
i
suppose
if
that
doctrine
had
had
sway
in
new
mexico,
we
never
have
been
here,
but
i
don't
think
that
he
becomes
the
most
power
of
the
persons.
i
think
that
--
by
the
way,
there
are
statistics
now
available,
which
i
quote
in
some
of
the
footnotes
in
terms
of
what
happens
to
the
ex-communist
and
actually
the
--
well,
perhaps,
some
of
them
may
be
very
valuable
fighters
against
communism.
the
ones
who
are
in
the
public
eye
all
the
time
because
of
perhaps
excessive
ways
or
all
means
of
fighting
communism
are
generally
the
--
or
not
generally,
are
actually
a
very
small
minority
of
the
number
of
ex-communists.
we
have
700,000
ex-communists
about.
we
have
about
30
--
30,000
members
of
the
communist
party
today,
which
means
that
about
25
times
as
many
people
have
been
in,
learned
what
the
party
was
about
and
left
as
are
in
the
party
today.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
well,
i
would
say
on
this
record
that
that
was
merely
a
method
of
foreclosing
this
court
from
examining
the
uncontradicted
facts
and
the
admitted
facts
of
the
record
which
show
that
there
is
a
constitutional
issue,
which
is
presented
by
the
actual
record,
not
as
the
court
would
have
made
it
then.
the
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
you
mean
if
they
said
that
they
are
not
satisfied
that
he
had
--
that
he
had
--
that
he
had
bona-idedly
left
the
communist
party?
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
i
see.
well,
if
they
said
that
they
were
not
satisfied
that
he
had
--
that
he
did
not
believe
in
the
forcible
overthrow
of
the
government.
and
there
was
a
record
from
which
they
could
have
made
such
an
inference.
and
if
that
were
a
requirement
of
admission
to
the
bar,
i
would
say
that
it
was
a
perfectly
reasonable
requirement.
but
again,
that
situation
isn't
present
here.
again,
his
uncontradicted
testimony
and
the
accepted
testimony
all
throughout
was
that
he
had
left
the
communist
party.
again,
even
if
they
had
said
what
they
did,
what
--
what
you
say
they
might
have
said,
what
they
said
here
was
no
such
thing.
here,
they
rested
entirely
upon
the
past
membership.
this
--
this
was
the
basis
of
their
decision.
they
said
that
very
clearly,
“past
membership
in
the
communist
party”.
they
said
nothing
otherwise.
that
i
think
is
at
page
150.
petitioner
is
also
dissatisfied
because
we
did
not
rule
where
the
former
membership
in
the
communist
party
alone
establishes
a
lack
or
absence
of
good
moral
character.
the
answer
to
this
is
that
the
question
was
not
and
is
not
now
before
us.
we
stated
in
our
opinion
and
we
reiterate
here,
we
believe
one
who
was
knowingly
and
again
they
have
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
that.
we
believe
one
who
has
knowingly
given
his
loyalties
to
such
a
program
and
belief
for
six
to
seven
years
during
a
period
of
responsible
adulthood
is
a
person
of
questionable
character.
this
conduct
of
petitioner,
together
with
his
other
former
actions
in
the
use
of
aliases
and
record
of
arrests,
and
his
present
attitude
toward
these
matters
and
were
the
considerations
upon
which
the
application
was
denied.
so
that
the
hypothetical
case
you
mentioned,
your
honor,
which
is
a
difficult
one
of
course,
is
not
the
one
that
is
actually
present
before
this
court.
threads
of
it
is
present
of
course
in
the
--
yesterday's
case,
kingsburg
case.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
i'm
not
sure
it
would
be
unconstitutional
on
its
phase,
but
i'm
sure
that
in
many
situations
it
would
be
unconstitutional
as
applied.
because
it
could
be
--
if
the
outside
corporate
body
acted
arbitrarily
or
unreasonably,
or
let's
--
and
let's
take
the
example,
let's
suppose
they
said
that
no
catholics,
no
jews
can
be
admitted
to
the
bar.
i'm
sure
that
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no,
its
let
--
let's
say
that
the
corporate
body
which
exercises
his
power
says
that
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
--
and
they
act
pursuant
to
it,
and
they
excluded
you
in
a
catholic.
no
hesitancy
in
saying
that
the
statute
is
applied
therein
or
at
least
the
action
that
was
taken
under
it
would
be
considered
unconstitutional.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
pardon?
how
would
you
enforce
that
conclusion
if
the
state
constitution
also
says,
"there
shall
be
no
ruling,
no
reviewing
part,
no
court
in
this
state
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
consider
and
review
the
action
of
the
state
bar
examiners."
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that
would
be
a
rough
procedural
question.
i
suppose
what
i
would
do,
and
this
is
a
quick
off-hand
guess
of
course
if
they
say
that
there's
therefore
no
state
remedy,
go
into
the
federal
court
to
seek
a
declaratory
judgment
or
injunction.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
the
basis
would
be
that
the
action
was
arbitrary
and
unreasonable,
violative
of
freedom
of
religion
and
speech.
this
is
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
exactly.
and
this
was
of
course
the
situation
which
was
mentioned
in
the
summers
case,
where
the
court
said
that
you
could
not
take
arbitrary
action
in
barring
somebody.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes,
you
would,
yes.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
well,
i
--
no,
because
here
the
supreme
court
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that
is
a
problem
which
has
been
suggested,
arises
in
the
medical
profession.
gilmore
and
his
brokerage
have
cited,
had
some
discussion
of
that
and
i
suppose
that
might
be
declared
unconstitutional
under
the
state
statute
as
a
delegation
of
judicial
functions
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no.
i
would
say
that
would
very
probably
be
a
denial
of
procedural
due
process.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
well,
i
think
for
one
thing
that
the
denial
of
the
remedy
and
the
unavailability
of
the
remedy
might
be
considered
as
state
action,
an
endorsement
of
what
the
board
did.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
i
really
will
have
a
difficulty
in
saying
--
in
saying
that's
your
answer.
my
feeling
would
be
that
the
court
could
--
that
the
man
could
say
that
i
should
have
some
right
to
have
the
government
run
governmental
affairs
and
that,
it's
an
abuse
of
due
process
where
i'm
given
no
remedy
of
any
sort
from
the
action
of
a
body
which
has
no
standards
of
any
sort.
and
i
would
say
that
in
that
case,
they
could
come
in.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
well
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
i
--
that
is
in
this
case.
in
any
event,
it's
a
rough
question,
but
i
don't
think
that's
present
in
this
case
at
all
because
here,
the
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
well,
i
think
that
this
case
--
to
use
your
analogy,
sir,
i
think
this
case
would
be
the
case
where
that
board
uses
the
standards
of
religious
belief
or
political
belief.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
and
in
that
--
that's
right.
and
in
that
particular
case,
of
course,
the
initial
question
of
whether
you
could
make
the
delegation
wouldn't
arise,
the
real
question
would
be
the
standards
that
they
could
use.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
exactly,
sir.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
right.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
and
i
think
here,
this
was
clearly
a
violation
of
due
process,
which
is
of
course
the
basic
theme
of
the
entire
argument
in
the
brief
that
i
trust
here.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
well,
i
imagine
it
varies
from
state
to
state.
in
new
mexico,
the
function
of
the
bar
committee,
as
i
understand
it,
is
to
make
recommendations.
in
page
42
of
my
opponent's
brief,
which
i
happen
to
have
handy,
so
i
quote
from
that
one,
the
statutory
provisions
are
quoted.
“with
the
advice
and
approval
of
the
supreme
court,
the
board
of
commissioners
of
the
state
bar
shall
have
power,”
and
then
i'm
skipping
some
lines,
“to
recommend
such
as
fulfill
the
qualifications
to
the
supreme
court
for
admission
to
practice
under
this
act.
the
approval
by
the
supreme
court
to
such
recommendation
shall
entitle
such
applicants
to
be
enrolled,”
etcetera.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
well
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that
wouldn't
quite
come
up
because
they
test
the
character
qualification
before
the
bar
examination
in
a
state.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
a
mental
examination?
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes.
yes,
a
written
examination.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
my
friends
from
new
mexico
told
me,
yes.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes,
sir,
exactly.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
sure.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
surely.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes,
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
well,
i
don't
think
it's
a
question
of
weighing
it
over
again,
sir.
because
i
submit
here,
first,
there
is
no
such
evidence
and
that
the
real
question
is
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no,
i
think
it
goes
one-step
further
because
here,
the
questions
are
the
standards
that
they
used.
if
you
had
a
tort
of
action
of
negligence
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
right.
now,
let's
--
let's
suppose
we
have
that
situation
and
the
judge
made
a
ruling
that
there
is
no
evidence
here
to
support
the
plaintiff
because
the
plaintiff
--
we
find
the
plaintiff
to
be
of
bad
moral
character
since
he's
a
jew
or
a
catholic,
then
you
have
this
case.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
it's
a
question
of
whether
there's
a
reasonable
relationship
to
--
of
what
--
of
the
standard
that
they
are
using
to
the
question
that
they
applied.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
again,
in
that
particular
case,
there
is
no
real
constitutional
issue
that's
raised.
here,
the
whole
question
is
the
standard
that
is
being
used
to
determine
whether
this
man
has
bad
moral
character.
these
standards
all
trespass
upon
the
fourteenth
amendments
--
fourteenth
amendment,
the
question
of
due
process,
reasonable
relationship,
shocking
the
conscience
and
all
of
that.
the
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
because
they
tell
us,
sir.
they
say
that
in
the
language
that
i
quoted
from
before,
that
this
--

"this
conduct
of
petitioner,
referring
to
the
past
membership
in
the
communist
party,
this
conduct
of
petitioner
together
with
his
other
former
actions
and
the
use
of
aliases,
and
record
of
arrest,
and
his
present
attitude
towards
those
matters,
which
there
isn't
any
indication
of,
were
the
considerations
upon
which
application
was
denied."
that
is
spelled
out
very,
very
clearly.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
right.
this
is
purely
a
question
of
the
standards
that
they
used.
this
is
why
i
say
there
is
no
question
of
burden
of
proof
or
of
evidence
in
this
case.
purely
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
very
definitely,
sir.
that's
why
in
response
to
mr.
justice
harlan
before,
i
began
to
indicate
that
if
the
court
had
attempted
to
avoid
the
constitutional
question
by
changing
the
facts
or
making
a
factual
determination,
which
was
obviously
completely
unsupported
by
the
record,
that
put
in
your
terms,
the
constitutional
--
what
they
determine
would
be
judged
by
this
court
on
the
basis
of
what
they
did
or
put
in
the
way
i
had
formulated
and
previously,
the
court
below
could
not
circumvent
this
court's
constitutional
jurisdiction
by
such
method.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
very
clearly,
sir.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
it's
very
definitely.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes,
i
think
it
has
somewhat
more
than
a
mere
something
to
do
with
it
because
in
the
ex
parte
garland
case,
the
court
did
hold.
this
court
did
hold
there
that
the
past
acts
of
a
person,
even
in
supporting
the
revolution
or
the
civil
war
against
the
north,
bore
no
reasonable
relationship
to
his
qualification
to
practice
law
or
following
ministry.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes,
that's
right.
he
had
actually
acted
and
participated
in
it.
we
would
have
the
same
case
here
if
this
man
had
been
knowingly
a
member
of
the
party
and
had
participated
in
its
illegal
activities,
which
he
didn't
even
do.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no.
the
only
evidence
that
there
is
in
regard
to
his
communist
party
activities,
is
what
he
tells
us
and
what
he
tells
us
who
--
and
his
word
being
accepted
all
the
way
through,
is
that
he
was
active
in
the
labor
movement.
that
in
fact,
when
he
organized
the
union
he
was
so
knowledgeable
of
the
communist
methods
that
he
even
delivered
the
union
that
he
organized
right
into
the
lap
of
the
af
of
l.
and
his
organizing
of
the
unions
was
for
the
purpose
of
advancing
the
course
of
the
working
men.
so
that
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
here
that
this
is
one-step
worse
than
the
garland
case.
in
the
garland
case,
it
was
depriving
a
man
of
a
right
or
privilege
of
practicing
law
or
following
ministry
because
of
his
past
acts
which
were
concededly
illegal.
here,
this
man
would
be
deprived
of
his
right
or
privilege
to
practice
law
because
of
a
past
affiliation
which
was
perfectly
legal
and
without
scienter.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
i'm
sure
that
would
mean
no
difference
at
all.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
not
the
least
indication,
sir.
i
might
say,
well,
we're
on
the
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no,
i
don't
think
that
any
inference
could
be
drawn
of
bad
moral
character
or
as
a
part
of
the
evidence
to
be
used
against
him,
because
again,
there
was
nothing
in
what
that
man
did
to
indicate
bad
moral
character.
the
acts
that
he
committed
were
perfectly
consistent
with
good
moral
character.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
and
there
were
millions
who
thought
that
what
the
people
on
the
north
did
showed
that
they
were
bad
moral
character
too.
i
think
the
conclusion
to
be
drawn
from
that,
sir,
is
that
the
court
--
no
court
can
make
a
political
judgment.
and
from
a
political
judgment
of
morality,
and
from
that
draw
an
inference
as
to
a
person's
good
or
bad
moral
character,
i
would
not,
for
example,
say
that
a
person
who
believed
in
what
senator
joseph
mccarthy
was
doing
could
be
by
virtue
of
that,
said
to
be
a
person
of
bad
moral
character
or
that
this
was
an
evidence
of
his
bad
moral
character
for
the
reason
that
i
think
that
no
court
should
trespass
upon
the
political
area
of
thought
in
determining
bad
moral
character.
as
distinguished
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
but
the
basis
of
the
decision
did
not
rest
upon
that
at
all,
sir.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
the
court
talked
about
it,
but
in
its
reasoning
and
the
ratio
decidendi
after
its
opinion,
they
made
no
aversion
to
that.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no.
[laughs]
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
in
fact
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
oh,
definitely
not.
i
--
i
remember,
sir,
in
fact,
when
i
argued
newark
v.
hutchinson
before
the
--
i
mentioned
to
this
court
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
asked
me
two
particular
questions,
saying
i
know
these
are
irrelevant
but
let's
clear
the
woods.
and
again,
i
don't
think
therefore
that
the
questions
had
anything
to
do
with
your
decision
in
newark
v.
hutchinson.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no,
they
aren't,
but
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
right.
but
where
the
theory
of
the
case
is
entirely
set
forth
and
does
not
at
all
depend
upon
the
facts
recited.
i
don't
think
you
can
say
that
the
facts
recited
control
the
theory.
i
wouldn't
think
that
--
i
wouldn't
try
to
distinguish
a
case
in
that
basis
myself.
i
might
try
it
as
a
lawyer
but
i
know
i
shouldn't.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no.
no,
i
wouldn't
say
that.
i
might
try
it
but
i
wouldn't
expect
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes.
maybe
even
if
i
did
stretch
a
point
and
tried
it,
i
wouldn't
expect
the
court
to
follow
me.
i
think
also
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
well,
even
if
it
were
irrelevant,
let's
assume
that
for
the
purposes
of
argument,
i
think
that
if
you
could
say
it
was
relevant,
you
had
in
effect
the
same
situation
here
where
there
was
no
illegality
at
all
in
the
communist
party
during
this
man's
period
of
membership.
there
was
nothing,
even
to
pardon.
it's
an
even
better
case.
and
this
was
in
the
popular
front
period
too.
also,
of
course,
this
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
popular
--
it's
not
a
term
of
art,
it's
a
political
term.
and
this
of
course
shows
the
difficulty
of
getting
into
this
area.
i
think
you
can
look
into
the
communist
party
area
to
determine
illegality.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
well,
i
think
you're
quite
right,
sir.
i
think
also
that
what
the
court
did
below
is
to
fail
to
take
into
account
the
change
in
this
man
and
the
various
opinions
that
have
been
handed
down
by
members
of
this
court.
in
the
garner
case,
for
example,
the
--
one
of
the
reasons
this
court
upheld
the
oath
was
that
it
had
no
reason
to
suppose
that
the
oath
would
affect
adversely
those
persons
who,
during
their
affiliation
with
the
prescribed
organization,
were
innocent
of
its
purpose
as
schware,
or
those
who
severed
their
relations
with
any
such
organization
when
its
character
became
apparent,
as
did
schware.
and
again,
mr.
justice
burton
in
that
case
construed
the
oath
differently
than
did
the
majority
of
the
court
and
voted
to
thrust
it
down.
he
said
as
follows,
“the
oath
is
so
framed
as
to
operate
retrospectively
as
a
perpetual
bar
to
those
employees
who
held
certain
views
at
any
time
since
the
date
five
years
preceding
the
effective
date
of
the
ordinance,
at
least
no
room
for
a
change
of
heart.”
the
court
below
do
not
consider
the
change
of
heart.
it
calls
for
more
than
a
profession
of
present
loyalty
or
promise
of
future
attachment,
so
did
the
court
below.
it
is
not
limited
in
retrospect
to
any
period,
measured
by
reasonable
relation
to
the
present
did
owe
for
the
court
below.
it
took
actions
from
15
to
25
years
before
and
rested
entirely
on
that
basis.
in
time,
this
ordinance
will
amount
to
the
requirement
of
an
oath
to
be
defined
that
has
never
done
any
of
the
prescribed
acts.
and
this
of
course
is
precisely
what
the
court
below
really
required.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no,
there
was
no
requirement
in
new
mexico
law
or
in
the
application
form
or
anything
for
that.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
i
don't
think
there
would
have
been
any
difference
at
all,
sir,
except
that
this
would
be
a
stronger
case
and
that
here
you
have
a
measurable
period
of
a
decade
or
more
years
during
which
this
man
has
lived
a
blameless
life
and
the
fact
that
he
is
being
judged
entirely
on
the
past.
in
the
garland
case,
you
--
if
i
remember
my
dates
correctly,
the
dates
of
consideration
of
admission
to
the
bar
were
very
close
to
the
dates
of
the
rebellion
or
the
civil
wars,
that
there
was
no
period
of
time
really
for
a
man
to
prove
himself.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
i'm
afraid
i
don't
recall
that
either.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
[laughs]
i
do
too,
sir.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
i
think
in
some,
we
can
say
that
what
the
court
did
was
to
rest
upon
this
past
membership
in
a
concededly
legal
political
party
without
any
evidence
of
scienter
of
any
evil
motivations.
i
might
say
just
to
clarify
the
facts
that
i
think
my
opponents
perhaps
give
themselves
away,
in
their
brief
in
page
28.
i'm
talking
about
scienter,
right
at
the
top.
there
can
be
no
real
doubt
of
the
validity
of
a
finding
of
scienter
in
this
case.
this
is
not
a
case
like
wieman
v.
updegraff
in
which
knowing
and
unknowing
participation
and
proscribed
affiliates
of
the
communist
party
were
like
condemned.
there
would
appear
to
be
no
sensible
reason
why
the
principle
of
that
case
should
be
applied
at
all
to
membership
in
the
communist
party
as
distinguished
from
its
affiliates.
unwitting
membership
in
the
communist
party
seems
to
us,
mr.
chief
justice
stone,
preposterous.
they
cite
schneiderman
where
of
course
chief
justice
stone
did
not
say
that
but
said
that
a
man
who
distributed
particular
parts
of
communist
literature
advocating
certain
things
should
be
held
for
knowledge
of
those
at
the
parties
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
i'm
quoting
from
my
opponent.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
oh,
yes.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
it
was
my
opponent
who
quoted
it.
[laughs]
i
am
just
mentioning
that
here
actually
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
oh,
i
agree,
sir.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
but
for
my
opponent
to
mention
it,
i
am
actually
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
sure.
this
is
a
hand-me-down
mention
just
in
terms
of
showing
that
the
court
--
the
court
below
is
not
even
concerned
with
the
problem
of
scienter,
so
that
even
if
these
were
an
illegal
party
at
the
time
this
case
would
--
the
decision
below
requiring
the
phase
of
wieman
v.
updegraff.
they
claimed
that
there
was
scienter.
my
opponents
claimed
it
based
on
an
examination
of
the
petitioner
at
pages
45
through
49
of
the
record,
in
which
they
say,
“look,
he
knew
all
about
the
communist
party.”
but
of
course
the
questioning,
i
won't
bother
reading
it.
it's
too
lengthy.
but
the
questioning
deals
solely
with
questions
like
if
you
are
a
true
communist
--
if
you
are
a
true
communist,
then
certain
things
follow,
what
is
contrary
to
the
principles
of
communism
and
so
on.
in
other
words,
they
talk
all
about
--
they
are
asking
schware,
what
does
he
think
of
the
communist
party
today.
and
he
tells
them,
he's
obviously
knowledgeable,
he
tells
us
he
reads
both
communist
literature
and
the
material
of
the
house
committee,
an
un-american
activities,
and
he
sets
forth
his
knowledge
of
what
the
communist
party
is,
all
in
the
present
tense.
this,
my
opponents
contend
in
the
brief
indicates
that
in
1932
to
1940
he
knew
what
the
communist
party
was
about.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
and
the
record
shows
this.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
right.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
correct.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
correct,
sir.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
right.
at
that
time
he
did.
correct,
sir.
if
--
i
should
like
to
reserve
the
--
about
three
more
minutes
that
i
have
left.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
thank
you,
your
honor.
i'll
be
very
brief.
i
--
i
have
to
be.
first,
to
clarify
the
answers
to
--
the
answers
to
some
of
your
honor's
questions
about
what
was
in
this
confidential
report.
on
page
11
of
the
record,
you
find
one
of
the
board
members
saying,
“i
don't
think
our
action
was
motivated
in
any
way
by
any
accusations
or
anything
was
made
against
him
or
were
disclosed
in
some
way
by
a
report.”
mr.
dunlevy,
schware's
attorney,
“can
i
assume
then
that
there
is
nothing
adverse
in
that
report?”
board
member,
“no.”
another
board
member,
“nothing
more
adverse
than
what
he,”
meaning
schware,
“said.”
so
they
have
read
this.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
well,
i
don't
know,
but
i
do
know
that
they
checked
into
the
arrest
and
that
it
was
just
sent
here
by
the
attorney
general
and
that
they
found
nothing
--
and
in
here,
it
is
said
that
there
was
nothing
more
adverse
in
that
report
in
what
was
set
forth
in
the
record
here.
and
this
is
one
of
the
basis
upon
which
they
decided.
there
may
of
course
also
have
been
a
lot
in
that
confidential
report
which
was
favorable
to
schware.
and
in
terms
of
burden
of
proof,
i
noticed
that
what
the
attorney
general
stated
was
that
you
need
one
letter
of
recommendation,
apparently,
as
long
as
there
isn't
anything
black
against
the
man
in
order
to
get
admitted.
now,
here,
what
you
have
is
endorsements
by
virtually
everybody
and
the
man
is
not
admitted
based
purely
upon
what
are
really
political
judgments.
now,
i
think
the
chief
justice
inquired
whether
the
arrest
in
texas
for
the
stolen
car,
which
was
conceitedly
completely
innocent,
whether
that
arrest
had
been
considered.
my
only
answer
to
that
would
be
that
the
court
distinctly
says
that
they
rely
upon
the
record
of
arrest,
which
includes
that
particular
innocent
arrest.
they
apparently
rely
upon
the
mere
fact
of
arrest
without
any
question
even
of
the
circumstances
or
actually
of
the
innocence
of
the
man.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
well,
there
were
some
circumstances
in
the
record
of
the
case,
your
honor.
