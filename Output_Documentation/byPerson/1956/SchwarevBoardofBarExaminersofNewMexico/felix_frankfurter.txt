the
first
agreement
to
the
rest
of
the
five
minutes,
you
summarize
what
you
can
achieve
the
meaning
of
showing
up
this
record
whether
this
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
1934
to
1940?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
uncontroversy.
it's
not
moved
yet,
but
i
--
it's
the
content
as
of
the
time
of
the
inquiry,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
represent
--
assume
the
word
to
be
whether
he
was
a
communist
or
they
have
terminated
his
membership
in
1944
rather
than
1940.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
relevance
of
that?
is
that
an
estoppel?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
what
is
--
what
is
the
point
of
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
my
difficulty,
the
statement
that
a
man
was
allowed
to
take
an
examination.
i
can
hardly
reach
the
conclusion,
the
contempt
that
he
was
to
be
admitted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
going
to
be
in
new
york,
after
you
testify
you
have
to
go
through
the
casual
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
they
deny
admission
to
the
bar
because
a
man
is
a
member
of
the
clan?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
he
was
a
dupe
or
not,
will
we
reexamine
that
claim?
justice
felix
frankfurter
idealism
doesn't
mean
a
dupe,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
being
a
dupe
means
having
idealistic
motives?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
taking
a
lot
of
it
very
far,
i
must
say.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
--
if
you
argue
to
find
some
words
or
some
strength
to
the
fact
that
he
was
duped,
how
can
any
committee
of
any
court
find
out
that
a
man
was
duped
just
by
examining
his
mind
out
of
something?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
if
this
is
relevant
at
all
and
we
got
to
--
then
we
have
to
within
a
court
or
bar
examiners
and
they
open
him
up
inquiring
to
what
he
thought,
why
he
thought
it,
when
thought
it,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that
so,
was
legal
territory
because
that
isn't
your
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
cross-examination
of
him
or
examination
inquiry
of
him
as
to
the
bona
fide,
the
fidelity,
the
complete
realization
that
--
that
he
still
doesn't
have
attachment
to
the
things
to
which
he
was
attached?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
it's
against
--
all
you
talk
about
dupe,
it
gets
into
difficulty
of
all
sort.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they'll
get
you
to
a
great
difficulty
before
you
get
through
with
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your'e
--
you're
not
suggesting.
isn't
it
a
part
of
your
argument
that
an
ex-communist
becomes
the
most
--
becomes
especially
virtue
of
that
then
finds
out
he
was
wrong?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
seems
to
be
a
doctrine
that
has
some
string
for
the
purpose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
levy,
let
me
put
you
on
a
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
relates
to
--
the
problem
that
i'm
trying
to
create
is
the
respective
function
of
this
court
and
the
state
court
in
the
problems
in
the
state,
the
scope
of
reviewing
the
part
of
this
court
in
the
matter
they
saw.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
i
suppose
everybody
was
being
granted
here,
and
we
can
review
admissions
to
the
bar
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
which
there
are
rejections,
i
suppose
everyday
in
the
city
of
new
york
and
it's
on
--
it
has
to
be
run,
i
believe,
because
i'm
advised
(inaudible)
i
suppose
a
state,
new
mexico
and
new
york,
california,
new
jersey,
i
don't
care
what,
suppose
one
of
the
state
as
part
of
this
movement
of
the
integrated
bar
and
you're
going
to
view
the
problem
of
the
commission
and
expulsion
from
the
bar,
the
way
the
english
do
it,
hand
it
all
over
to
the
corporate
membership
of
the
bar,
it
had
to
be
--
it
had
to
be
determined
who
can
be
admitted
into
the
bar
and
who
could
stay.
and
the
statute
of
the
constitution
of
the
states
further
go
around
and
say,
"no
court
shall
review
the
action,"
whatever
they
call
the
bar
examiners
(inaudible)
will
that
statute
be
unconstitutional
in
your
view?
justice
felix
frankfurter
catholics
or
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
would
you
enforce
that
conclusion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
you
invoke
this
kind
of
things
that
was
indicated
in
the
mooney
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
state
has
its
own
relief.
and
what
would
be
the
basis
on
which
you
go
in
to
the
federal
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
that's
what
this
problem
would
tell
me,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
could
you
go
into
the
federal
court
and
just
say
that
the
state
of
--
of
the
masters
asked
you
to
pass
the
statute
and
said
the
admission
to
the
bar
is
going
to
be
by
a
committee
of
bar
examiners.
i
--
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
know
but
i
don't
--
it
might
be
(inaudible)
of
the
integrated
bar,
district
of
california.and
they
shall
have
a
full
control
and
no
court
of
this
state
shall
have
the
reviewing
power.
now,
could
a
man
go
to
the
federal
court
merely
because
the
presentation
of
the
case
comes
from
the
state
agency
into
a
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
the
state.
never
mind
about
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
--
not
to
be
able
to
go
into
a
court.
i'm
not
talking
about
the
thing
that
we
can
just
a
minute
ago,
namely
--
namely,
that
you'd
make
out
a
case
of
--
of
your
case
excluding
because
of
a
religious
affiliation,
but
merely
because
you
can
go
into
the
court
to
have
it
reviewed
because
that
could
be
part
of
due
process.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
yes,
but
--
but
the
board
--
i'm
asking
whether
the
procedure,
whether
merely
saying,
"i
have
a
right
to
have
a
court
review
of
this."
never
mind
what
--
what
they
did.
i'd
like
to
have
a
court
pass
on
it.
i
would
like
to
dissociate
myself
with
--
within
the
(inaudible)
case,
that
alone
has
the
extension.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
party
--
gentlemen,
he
stand
in
the
courtroom.
justice
felix
frankfurter
never
mind
that.
i
don't
want
to
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
there
is
something,
i
think
i
have
to
face
that
in
order
to
--
this
argument,
in
order
to
ascertain
the
problem,
that
means
if
you
slurred
over
--
slurred
over
in
this
case,
slurred
over
the
private
case,
what
is
the
relation
of
this
court
is
to
the
state's
control
over
the
body?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
what
you're
saying
is
that
due
process
can
within
itself,
the
protection
against
any
--
against
arbitrary
action
in
the
exercise
of
power
if
you
could
ever
have
the
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
proposition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
believe
in
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
was
in
the
garland
case.
the
garland
case
had
a
very
important
ingredient.
the
president
granted
a
full
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
say
it
rested
upon
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
a
very
important
ingredient
and
we
don't
know
what
could
have
happened
considering
there
were
four
parts
of
dissent
in
the
sentence
if
they
haven't
been
approved
properly.
would
you
say
it
didn't
rest
on
it?
the
court
talked
about
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
have
a
strange
note
when
a
court
talks
about
something,
it
doesn't
because
they
deemed
it
relevant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
like
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
about
some
facts,
but
i
can
be
judged
by
that
standard.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
of
the
opinion
is
much
contested?
justice
felix
frankfurter
questions
are
intended
to
elicit
what
the
help
accountant
can
give.
justice
felix
frankfurter
sometimes,
an
irrelevant
question
brings
out
a
surprising
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
--
not
unless
you
thought
it
was
relevant,
then
you
would.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
clear
to
think
that
it
made
no
difference.
there
were
full
pardon
in
those
cases
that
really
could
draw
out
a
very
important
fact
that's
set
forth
because
it's
irrelevant.
i'm
not
protesting
from
other
things
that
were
said,
particularly
by
a
judge
who
has
given
the
court
a
reply.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
term
of
art,
a
popular
front?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
why
don't
you
rest
on
what
a
good
lawyer
states
instead
of
getting
off
to
--
but
i
regard
as
partly
saying
that
this
was
a
legally
recognized
party.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
it's
not
a
good
lawyer's
statement
instead
of
getting
off
that
this
was
a
popular
front
area?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
restricting
a
case
to
what
it
decides
doesn't
indicate
(inaudible)
one
as
i
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
would
then
help
you
out,
why
don't
you
write
down
the
decision?
why
do
bother
about
the
dissent?
it's
not
the
tendency
of
the
bar.
court
opinions
are
all
the
same.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
prior
decision
and
strongly
as
i
believe
because
they're
undecided
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
do
i
follow
the
sentences?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
perhaps
everything
that
anybody
says
you
are.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
an
economy
of
proper
word
would
indicate
the
concept.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
your
position
in
effect
the
same
as
jews
for
being
a
man
of
idealistic
creature,
he
believes
heaven
and
earth
and
this
is
to
usher
in.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then,
he
discovered
that
it
wasn't
heaven
and
earth.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
did
think
it
was
during
that
period
and
he
dissociated
himself.
you
argued
effectively
as
you
could,
but
he
was
a
member
of
the
party.
why
then
puts
around
with
stuff
that
really
weakens
your
argument
about
that?
your
argument
is
that
during
the
critical
--
during
the
period
in
question,
he
was
a
member
of
the
party
which
had
legal
stand
in
this
country
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
promoted
for
him
in
every
state
or
one
state
with
the
union,
that
he
--
he
severed
himself
from
it
unquestioningly
because
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
he
did
it
and
that's
your
position,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then,
why
pass
around
the
(inaudible)
whether
he
did
or
did
not
(inaudible)
he
must
have
had
scienter
when
he
dissociated
himself
with
that
but
he
indicated
you've
known
it
was
something
that
he
finally
wasn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
just
disturb
your
argument
that
did
this.
tell
us
what
you
conceive
to
be
the
decision
of
your
supreme
court
which
is
here
for
review
and
what
the
issues
are
in
your
rule
that
we
have
to
adjudicate?
could
you
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
argument
but
just
state
the
proposition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
--
if
we
have
no
record
beyond
that
arbitration,
if
we
just
had
that
decision
of
your
supreme
court
and
no
record,
then
we
couldn't
tell,
we
couldn't
judge
the
decision
by
a
record,
which
supposedly
sustain
it.
but
we
do
have
a
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
in
the
light
of
that
fact,
could
you
particularize
or
subdivide
your
general
statement
which
i
had
set.
our
question
is
whether
that
decision
with
this
petitioner
who
offered
himself
to
admission
did
not
have
the
requisite
of
moral
character.
in
as
much
that
there
is
no
record
to
supposedly
sustain
that,
what
issue
does
the
record
present
in
order
to
--
not
merely
to
shock
him
but
to
define
the
issue
that
are
embraced
in
that
general
conclusion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
your
--
i
thought
your
position
is
that,
you
said
a
minute
ago
by
taking
them
all
together
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
them
together.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
they
were
part
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
now
open
to
this
court
to
ask
them
whether
there
were
any
sticks
in
these
bundled.
and
therefore,
whether
there
is
a
bundle?
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
all,
specifically.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
short,
specifically.
do
you
--
do
you
agree
or
do
you
think
it's
appropriate,
almost
necessary
for
us
to
examine
each
one
of
these
bases
to
see
if
there's
any
validity
to
each
one
as
a
matter
of
law,
namely,
is
there
a
rational
relation
to
the
first
one,
to
the
membership
to
the
communist
party
in
circumstance
for
this
record
during
the
period
that
said,
“is
this
--“
do
you
think
that
is
the
issue
which
raised
that
that
is
the
matter
which
raised
this
question
of
law
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
both
in
here
for
determination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
if
i'm
wrong,
you
can
sue
me
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
the
grounds
to
put
them
out
with
that
three
or
two
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
by
unconstitutional,
since
we
ultimately
are
on
due
process.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
test
is
whether
there's
any
relation,
a
good
reason
of
fact,
whatever
the
phrase
may
be,
arbitrary
put
it
on
appellee.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
if
that
leads
to
that
basis
is
an
arbitrary
determination,
an
arbitrary
consideration
which
is
the
result.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
isn't
it
--
wouldn't
be
unallowable
for
us
to
say?
for
all
we
know,
the
bar
examiners,
the
state
supreme
court,
his
belief
is
severed
from
the
communist
party
and
infer
--
they
infer
that
he's
a
communist
to
this
day,
would
that
be
allowable
or
not,
in
this
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
you
state
quite
candidly
that
in
order
to
find
out
whether
the
end
conclusion
had
any
basis,
we
have
to
take
each
--
each
ground
for
the
end
of
conclusion.
the
story
of
the
building
was
directed,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
on
the
first
one,
you
would
say
there's
nothing,
that
we
would
not
be
one
of
us
to
say
that
for
all
we
know
the
state
supreme
court,
this
belief
is
--
his
involvement
in
the
association,
and
therefore
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
they
would
assume
that
he
was
a
communist
at
the
time
that
this
came
up,
which
was
then
raised
of
the
fact
that
the
bases
were
rejected,
but
i
understood
to
say
that
we
could
not
make
such
a
gross
opinion
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
not
reject
any
subject
information
in
sustaining
the
first
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
would
--
do
i
infer
from
that
statement
that
if
this
court
should
reject,
irrelevant
to
the
extent
that
it's
not
the
--
it's
impossible
to
take
that
into
account.
that
if
this
court
also
reject
round
one,
it
wouldn't
have
to
bother
about
the
other
because
it
couldn't
tell
what
the
dissent
to
that
first
round
entered
into
the
final
decision.
that's
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
