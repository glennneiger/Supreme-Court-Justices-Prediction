mr.
fred
m.
standley
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
fred
m.
standley
mr.
levy.
the
point
that
i'm
going
to
address
my
remarks
to
--
well,
is
the
point
concerning
the
alleged
confidential
information.
now,
at
no
point
did
the
court
use
the
confidential
--
so-called
confidential
information
in
their
decision.
the
only
judge
who
said
that
he
had
even
looked
at
this
file
was
the
dissenting
judge.
the
bar
examiners
stated
in
their
--
at
some
point
in
the
record,
that
they
were
quite
sure
that
the
alleged
confidential
information
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
their
decision
either.
mr.
fred
m.
standley
i
think
it
was
in
their
findings
that
the
court
--
mr.
fred
m.
standley
in
--
in
the
findings
of
--
when
they
reached
their
decision.
mr.
fred
m.
standley
that's
--
that
was
--
that's
my
impression,
your
honor.
i'm
not
--
that's
--
that's
way
up
here
perjury
check.
justice
harlan
asked
a
question
at
the
outset
of
where
the
information
came
from
whether
that
he
was
connected
with
the
communist
party.
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
record
but
i
answered
the
question,
i
happened
to
know
in
--
when
he
filled
out
his
application,
the
arrest
appeared
on
the
application.
the
arrests
were
checked
into
and
the
thing
developed
in
there
was
a
part
of
the
confidential
information
that
led
the
bar
examiners
--
mr.
fred
m.
standley
no.
no,
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
he
was
--
on
the
application,
at
least,
he
was
concealing
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
mr.
levy
has
said,
he
mentioned
it
to
--
the
fact
to
the
dean
of
the
law
school.
the
dean
of
the
law
school
says,
“go
on
about
your
business.
we'll
worry
about
that
when
the
time
comes.”
or
words
of
that
thing.
mr.
fred
m.
standley
they
did
the
position
that
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
their
ultimate
determination.
mr.
fred
m.
standley
again,
that's
a
call
for
the
rank.
it's
kind
of
a
speculation
on
my
part,
but
i
think
what
that
means
is
that
they
didn't
consider
it,
didn't
consider
it
in
the
sense
of
perusing
it.
i
don't
--
i
think
that
that
is
true
of
their
--
of
their
answer.
however,
i
don't
know
--
mr.
fred
m.
standley
i
don't
know.
i
think
this
--
i
know,
i've
been
a
member
of
the
bar
examiners
in
new
mexico.
i'm
not
--
wasn't
on
it
at
the
time
this
case
came
up
but
i
sat
in.
and
i
know
that
they
usually
put
to
that
so-called
confidential
file
is
to
take
--
take
the
file
and
if
there
is
--
there
are
inferences
of
bad
moral
character
in
it,
then
you
call
your
witness
that
you
want
to
use
on
that.
and
i
don't
--
they
didn't
call
any
witnesses
as
a
result
of
this
so-called
confidential
file.
now,
the
clerk
of
the
court
does
that
and
not
the
examiners
themselves.
mr.
fred
m.
standley
i
think
--
i
think
that
that
--
i
think
that
certain
members
--
certain
of
them
are
read
and
i
think
there's
certain
letters
are
called
to
certain
--
to
the
chairman's
attention,
but
i
don't
think
that
all
of
the
examiners
read
all
of
the
letters,
no
sir.
i
think
--
mr.
fred
m.
standley
well,
i
--
mr.
fred
m.
standley
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
fred
m.
standley
i
think
that
--
that
the
letters,
your
honor,
are
--
i
know
that
they
are
read
very
thoroughly
by
the
clerk
--
the
bar
committee
clerk
--
the
clerk
of
the
bar
commission.
secretary
of
the
bar
commission
as
this
time
one
(inaudible),
he
is
clerk
of
the
court
also.
and
i
think
that
--
and
i
know
that
a
report
is
made
as
a
result
of
those
letters,
but
the
report
is
not
a
report
soon
as
those
as
this.
it's
--
it's
a
general
type
statement
and
as
a
matter
of
normalcy,
when
nothing
comes
up
of
any
to
--
to
disturb
the
bar
commissioners,
the
report
itself
is
a
sufficient
answer.
mr.
fred
m.
standley
no,
i
don't
think
that
is
so.
i
think
--
i
think
that
--
that
the
letters
in
both
cases
if
--
when
the
report
is
made
by
the
secretary,
he
states
that
the
general
tenure
of
the
bulk
of
the
letters.
and
you
see
a
report
is
also
gathered
from
this
reporting
service
that
all
--
that
are
pre-made
the
bar
association
has
used
rather
than
the
letters.
there's
--
they
have
two
sources
of
information
from
the
outset
in
st.
louise
or
chicago
that
reports
their
findings
and
also
the
independent
letters.
mr.
fred
m.
standley
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
i've
never
seen
that
in
the
file.
i
was
denied
access
to
it.
it
was
mr.
sloan
in
the
lower
court.
mr.
fred
m.
standley
yes,
your
honor.
that's
--
that's
in
his
application,
that
waiver.
now,
in
the
--
mr.
fred
m.
standley
your
honor,
as
a
pro
forma
matter,
we
have
--
new
mexico
requires
one
letter
of
endorsement
and
in
some
of
the
states
--
i'm
also
a
member
of
the
utah
bar
--
mr.
fred
m.
standley
--
and
they
would
--
mr.
fred
m.
standley
it's
not
an
endorsement
proposition.
mr.
fred
m.
standley
it's
a
letter
of
recommendation,
yes
sir.
it's
not
an
endorsement
and
send
somebody
to
get
that.
mr.
fred
m.
standley
i'm
a
member
of
the
utah
bar
and
it's
three
there
but
the
investigation
goes
on.
i
have
one
last
thing
to
say,
this
court
has
in
the
questions,
indicated
in
insistence
on
equating
the
good
moral
character
qualification
to
violations
of
law
and
i
don't
think
that's
necessarily
true.
for
instance,
if
a
man
was
arrested
for
rape,
i'd
say,
and
marries
the
girl,
he
can't
be
prosecuted.
yes,
but
the
case
has
to
be
no-crossed.
but
that
still
indicates
something
or
would
indicate
something
as
to
his
moral
character.
the
same
way
with
adultery,
we
--
new
mexico
has
no
statute
on
adultery.
there
are
great
many
people
who
thinks
--
think
that
an
adulterer
is
a
man
of
bad
moral
character.
i
--
i
don't
think
that
there
is
necessarily
a
connection
between
the
conviction,
so
far
as
moral
character
is
concerned.
i
realized
that
on
impeachment
and
criminal
cases
and
so
forth,
that's
required.
but
i
don't
think
that
it
necessarily
follows
that
you
have
to
be
convicted
of
a
crime
to
have
bad
moral
character.
