justice
harold
burton
and
they
conduct
the
examination?
justice
harold
burton
now,
if
--
if
they
found
that
an
applicant
had
not
passed
his
bar
examination,
will
their
decision
will
be
final?
justice
harold
burton
it
would
--
they
appeal
that
to
the
court
--
to
the
supreme
court?
justice
harold
burton
but
they
also
--
i
don't
know,
but
i
take
it
that
they
have
a
mental
examinations
on
it.
justice
harold
burton
and
does
a
--
must
a
man
pass
that
to
their
satisfaction?
justice
harold
burton
it
seems
to
be
obvious
that
he
would.
justice
harold
burton
so,
they
determine
that
question
of
fact.
justice
harold
burton
well,
you
have
to
establish
the
tort
action,
as
i
understand
it,
is
negligence.
justice
harold
burton
what
--
what
they're
determining
is
whether
it's
moral
character.
justice
harold
burton
that
--
that's
the
same
as
the
negligence.
justice
harold
burton
but
a
part
of
evidence
put
in
that
wouldn't
be
evidence
of
negligence.
justice
harold
burton
but
if
you
do
have
evidence
of
negligence
then
the
determination
of
the
jury
is
final.
justice
harold
burton
how
--
how
do
we
know
what
their
standards
are?
justice
harold
burton
well,
do
you
think
they
are
standards
rather
than
evidence?
