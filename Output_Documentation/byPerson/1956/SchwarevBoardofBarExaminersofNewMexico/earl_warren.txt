versus

of

mr.
levy,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may,
mr.
levy.
chief
justice
earl
warren
general
standley
or
mr.
sloan,
whichever
one.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sloan,
you
say
you
--
you
think
it
was
beside
the
point
of
whether
he
was
actually
guilty
of
violating
the
neutrality
laws
or
not.would
you
--
so
far
as
this
procedure
is
concerned,
would
you
say
the
same
thing
about
his
arrest
for
--
for
having
a
stolen
car
in
his
possession?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
what
--
what
is
the
distinction
between
the
two?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
--
that
would
be
true
if
--
if
it
was
proved
that
he
had
done
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
or
if
--
if
he
admitted
that
he
had
--
had
violated
the
law
just
as
--
as
it
would
be
if
he
has
admitted
he'd
stolen
the
car
or
you
would
prove
that
he'd
stolen
it.
but
it
seems
to
me
where
there's
an
absence
of
proof
as
to
his
violation
of
the
neutrality
act
that
an
arrest
for
that
--
for
that
cause
would
serve
no
greater
purpose
than
would
his
arrest
for
stealing
a
car
where
there
is
no
proof
that
he
was
guilty
of
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sloan,
do
you
consider
that
the
court
took
into
consideration
the
arrest
in
texas
for
stolen
automobile?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
they
mentioned
that
more
than
once
in
their
--
in
their
opinion,
did
they
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
would
be
the
reason
for
mentioning
it
if
they
didn't
consider
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
they
did
--
they
did
say
the
aliases
and
they
did
comment
on
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
during
the
course
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
of
their
opinion
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
they
didn't
exclude
that
either,
did
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
take
into
consideration.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
indicate
the
willingness
to
go
before
the
supreme
court
or
an
unwillingness
or
either
one
of
those?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
you
meant
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may,
mr.
sloan.
chief
justice
earl
warren
attorney
general
standley.
chief
justice
earl
warren
general
standley,
i'm
not
quite
clear
yet
just
what
this
--
what
position
the
board
of
examiners
took
from
this
confidential
information?
if
they
take
the
position
that
they
didn't
use
it
or
that
they
didn't
scrutinize
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know.
but
what
does
that
mean?
does
that
mean
that
--
could
that
mean
that
they
--
that
they
read
it
all
and
considered
it
all
and
then
decided
that
they
wouldn't
use
it
against
the
man?
is
that
what
it
means
or
does
it
mean
either
they
didn't
read
it
or
there
was
nothing
in
there
that
was
detrimental
to
the
man?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
didn't
they
say
that?
if
they
didn't
peruse
it,
why
didn't
he
say
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
--
you
wouldn't
think
that
they
would
send
out
these
letters
and
ask
people
for
this
information
and
then
not
read
it
when
it
comes
in?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
would
they
--
what
would
they
ask
people
to
send
in
that
information
for
if
they
didn't
read
it,
rather
have
a
hazard
way
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
determine
a
man's
right,
isn't
it?
suppose
the
letters
were
good
letters,
suppose
it
would
help
a
man
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
suppose
--
suppose
some
of
them
were
bad,
do
you
mean
to
say
that
they
--
that
they
wouldn't
read
them
after
they
had
sent
out
letters
to
people
asking
them
to
give
the
information?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
if
there
--
if
the
letters
are
favorable
to
the
petitioner,
why
the
board
never
sees
them,
but
if
the
clerk
thinks
they're
unfavorable,
why
they
see
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
anything
in
this
file
adverse
to
the
petitioner?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
levy,
you
may.
you
have
a
minute
or
two.
you
might
finish
now
and
you
won't
have
to
come
back
this
afternoon.
