justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
the
government
doesn't
argue
there
as
i
--
as
i
gather
from
their
brief.
what
they
say
is,
they
had
him
there
along
with
two
others
investigating
a
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
was
enough
--
enough
evidence
to
get
anybody?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
they
claim
they
had
a
right
to
investigate
and
interrogate
witnesses
and
they
recommend
an
injustice
to
him
to
arraign
him
or
charge
him
with
the
murder
when
they
didn't
have
the
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
issue
is
drawn
on
whether
that's
a
sufficient
reasoning.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
mean
that
that's
the
argument
between
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
i
do
not
read
in
the
arguments
and
in
the
brief
of
the
government,
any
challenge
to
the
fact.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
could
have
been
taken
to
a
commissioner
much
earlier?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
statute
which
authorizes
you
have
at
least
to
summon
a
man
to
give
evidence
before
them
as
--
the
way
this
man
gave
evidence?
is
there
any
statute
which
specifically
authorizes
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
--
in
effect
you
are
(inaudible)
are
you
not?
that
these
three
people,
probable
witnesses
that
you
wanted
to
interrogate.
and
you
claim
that
they
had
the
right
based
on
their
asking
--
they
asked
a
question
to
the
witness,
that
he
wasn't
on
duty
and
have
him
arrested
at
that
time
or
to
take
him
before
the
commissioner
but
he
didn't
have
--
or
enough
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
that's
true,
do
you
have
it
as
statutory
authority
for
summoning
people
as
witness
by
the
police
or
do
you
have
to
defend
here
on
somehow
rights
to
arrest
him
without
a
right
to
--
just
because
they
--
they're
a
witness.
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
assuming
that
you
had
a
right
to
interrogate
them
as
witnesses
is
what
i
mean.
if
or
under
some
kind
of
procedure,
had
you
gone
through
any
kind
of
procedure
that
was
either
legally
authoring
to
do
that
or
on
its
face
permitted
you
to
do
it?
