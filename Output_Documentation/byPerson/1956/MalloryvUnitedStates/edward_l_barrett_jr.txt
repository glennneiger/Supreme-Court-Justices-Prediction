mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
address
myself
first
to
the
mcnabb
question
and
reserving
the
other
two
questions
for
later
consideration.
it's
noteworthy
that
in
this
case;
petitioner
makes
no
claim
that
his
confession
was
a
result
of
coercion,
physical
or
psychological.
the
petitioner
himself
testified
in
this
case
that
he
had
been
treated
kindly
and
made
no
complaint
with
respect
to
actual
coercion.
the
petitioner's
claim
on
the
mcnabb
point
is
essentially
that
rule
5
(a)
must
be
interpreted
as
forbidding
any
delay
in
taking
a
person
before
the
committing
magistrate,
other
than
that
physically
necessary
for
locating
a
magistrate
and
transporting
the
prisoner
there.
we
then
argued
that
under
the
mcnabb
rule,
any
confession
obtained
during
a
period
of
delay
and
beyond
that
must
be
excluded.
now,
the
government
concedes,
of
course,
that
the
police
could
have
found
a
committing
magistrate
and
brought
the
petitioner
before
him
within
a
relatively
short
time
after
his
arrest
at
2:30
on
a
thursday
afternoon.
it
is
the
government's
petition
--
position,
the
rule
5
(a)
must
be
given
a
broader
interpretation.
that
delay
may
be
necessary
within
the
meaning
of
the
rule
beyond
the
time
physically
necessary
to
take
an
arrested
person
before
a
magistrate.
that
the
delay
in
this
case
was
necessary
on
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
rule
and
that
hence
from
mcnabb
rule
does
not
apply
to
exclude
this
confession.
the
facts
in
this
case,
we
think,
are
an
excellent
example
of
the
reason
why
a
mechanical
interpretation
of
rule
5
(a)
as
applying
only
to
the
time
actually
necessary
to
find
a
magistrate
to
take
a
man
before
him,
would
be
an
undesirable
interpretation.
consider
what
you
have
here.
a
rape
was
committed
in
the
basement
of
an
apartment
house.
the
facts
are
that
this
basement
may
be
reached
by
a
set
of
wooden
stairs
or
through
a
door,
into
a
janitor's
apartment.
the
courts
investing
the
right
of
the
victim,
tells
the
police
that
after
she
came
down
to
this
basement
to
do
her
washing,
she
heard
nobody
come
down
these
set
of
wooden
stairs.
that's
conceded.
and
the
petitioner
himself
conceded
that
he
had
been
in
the
room
shortly
before
the
rape
and
to
help
the
victim
with
a
hose.
the
inference
at
this
point
was
that
--
probability
was
that
the
person
who
committed
the
crime
came
from
the
janitor's
apartment.
the
description
given
by
the
victim
would
have
fitted
generally,
apparently,
the
petitioner
and
his
two
nephews.
a
tall,
negro
with
bright
eyes,
with
a
white
hat,
was
about
as
much
as
the
victim
was
able
to
say
at
this
stage
of
the
game.
so,
hereafter,
preliminary
investigation,
the
police
were
faced
with
the
fact
that
on
the
physical
evidence
there
was
a
reasonable
suspicion
at
least
that
one
of
these
three
people
committed
the
rape.
further
investigation
apparently
disclosed
that
the
petitioner
and
one
of
his
nephews
had
disappeared.
the
next
morning,
at
some
point,
it's
not
clear
from
the
record.
the
police
picked
up
the
two
nephews,
brought
them
into
the
police
station
and
questioned
them.
that
record
doesn't
disclose
how
long
or
under
what
circumstances
with
respect
to
the
crime.
they
finally
found
the
petitioner
at
2:30
in
the
afternoon.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
the
nephews
stayed
and
i'll
deal
with
that.
the
nephews
were
at
the
police
station
when
the
petitioner
was
brought
in.
they
brought
the
petitioner
in
and
they
questioned
him.
now,
several
officers
were
apparently
present
during
the
questioning
though
the
record
doesn't
tell
us
much
about
this.
and,
it's
well
to
remember
that
this
case
was
tried
well
over
a
year
after
the
arrest.
so
that
everybody's
memories
with
respect
to
the
details
were
undoubtedly
fuzzy.
he
was
questioned
--
it's
probable,
though
the
record
is
not
entirely
clear
that
he
was
questioned
in
the
presence
of
his
two
nephews.
he
said
that
they
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
insofar
as
i
know,
the
record
doesn't
disclose
anything
on
that
but
i
assume
he
was
picked
up
without
a
warrant.
apparently
he
testified.
the
petitioner
testified
that
his
nephews
and
his
brother
were
questioned
--
were
present
when
he
was
questioned
at
this
initial
period.
officer
(inaudible)
testified
that
the
nephews
were
present,
part
of
the
time.
one
of
the
nephews
testified
that
he
didn't
think
the
petitioner
was
questioned
in
his
presence.
that's
about
the
state
of
the
record
on
that
point.
after
a
period
of
questioning
which
was
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
well,
there
were
other
suspects,
plus
his
brother
who
apparently
was
not
a
suspect
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
--
within
this
case.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
there's
--
i'm
not
--
this
record
isn't
clear
but
my
assumption
from
the
record
is
the
brother
who
was
an
older
man
evidently
were
--
was
never
suspected
here.
it
was
the
two
nephews
and
that
record
only
shows
interrogation
of
the
defendant
and
the
two
nephew
--
the
petitioner
and
the
two
nephews.
nothing
would
respect
to
his
brother.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
from
--
in
--
in
the
petitioner's
case
from
4
until
8.
at
6
o'clock
they
sent
out
apparently
for
a
lie
detector
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
excuse
me.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
he
came
about
6
o'clock.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
the
consent
was
somewhere
around
four
they
--
and
then
they
sent
out
and
then
he
came
in.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
no
sir.
the
--
the
--
he
came
at
six
and
he
took
first
one
of
the
nephews
for
an
hour,
approximately.
then
the
other
nephew
for
an
hour
and
he
got
the
petitioner
at
8
o'clock.
the
man
who
offered
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
no,
sir.
this
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
the
record
shows
that
--
the
only
thing
the
record
shows
on
this
is
that
at
the
point
later
--
much
later
on
at
which
he
was
given
the
lie
detector,
in
which
he
was
given
the
lie
detector
or
under
which
he
signed
the
--
was
about
to
sign
the
written
confession,
you'll
find
it
in
the
bottom
of
page
42
of
the
record.
after
he'd
been
confronted
with
the
complaining
witness
after
he'd
made
the
oral
admissions
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
was
around
--
late
at
night
around
11
o'clock.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
it
was
before
--
actual
arraignment
--
it
was
after
the
police
made
an
attempt
to
get
in
touch
with
the
commissioner.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
yes.
he
was
arraigned
the
next
morning
after
all
these
happened,
sometime
during
the
morning.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
yes,
sir.
however,
we
don't
know.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
yes.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
i
should
add
that
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
suggests
that
had
he
wanted
counsel,
he
could
not
have
had
it.
he
wasn't
isolated
from
family
and
friends
at
least
in
the
sense
of
being
secreted
in
the
back
room.
he
was
held
in
an
office,
his
brother
was
evidently
in
and
out.
and
the
--
the
situation
is
--
is
different
but
not,
i
suggest,
perhaps
materially,
different
than
if
he'd
been
asked
the
question
in
his
home
when
you
come
down
to
the
police
station
and
take
the
lie
detector
test.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
evidence
is
somewhat
more
conflicting
on
this
issue
than
mr.
bryant
suggested.
actually
one
psychiatrist
whose
testimony
or
that
appears
here
in
--
in
the
record
that's
before
you
on
page
--
page
4,
a
dr.
(inaudible)
saw
that
petitioner
for
an
hour
from
the
jail,
a
few
days
after
the
event.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
of
the
transcript,
that's
before
here.
it's
a
letter
report
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
--
appears
at
the
bottom.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
appointed
by
the
court.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
at
this
point,
appointed
three
psychiatrists
to
determine
the
issue
of
sanity.
the
three
came
in
with
or
that
i
guess
that
was
two.
the
two
came
in
with
this
--
agreed
that
he
was
mentally
ill
at
the
time.
now,
this
particular
psychiatrist
also
said
the
patient
appeared
to
be
dull
and
apathetic
and
mildly
confused.
no
former
psychological
test
were
given
but
the
estimate
of
his
intelligence,
is
that
of
a
moron.
now,
he
was
sent
to
st.elizabeth
and
after
90
days
was
sent
back.
the
three
doctors
from
st.elizabeth
testified
that
he
wasn't
insane.
that
he
hadn't
been
at
the
time
he
came
or
they
filed
a
report
testified
that
he
hasn't
been
insane
at
the
time
he
came
to
them
and
that
on
their
--
on
their
investigation
he
wasn't.
now,
later
on,
now
it
is
not
in
this
transcript.
it's
in
the
original
transcript.
dr.
(inaudible)
testified
in
this
case.
it
appears,
beginning
at
page
365
of
the
type-written
transcript.
in
--
in
which
again
he
repeated
his
assertion
that
the
petitioner
was
a
high
grade
moron.
but
again
this
testimony
was
based
on
his
hour
of
examination
of
a
year
and
two
months,
previously.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
i
think
so,
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
yes.
but
at
any
rate,
none
of
the
other
people
who
testified
said
anything
directly
about
--
none
of
the
other
doctors
got
to
the
issue
of
the
petitioner's
intelligence.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
well
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
very
little.
he
stated
to
one
of
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
he
was
19
at
this
time.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
he
stated
to
one
of
the
doctors
that
--
who
--
according
to
the
doctor
that
he
was,
"how
far
did
you
go
school
in
"eight
grade?
"how
did
you
do?"
"i
did
good."
he
stated
on
his
oral
examination
that
he
went
to
the
seventh
grade
in
school.
and
that's
about
all
the
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
there's
nothing
in
the
printed
record
here
as
i
remember
from
looking
over
the
written
transcript.
he
--
he
had
come
up
to
the
--
from
--
he
had
come
here
not
--
two
or
three
months
before
the
event
from
greenville,
south
carolina
for
six
or
seven
weeks.
and
as
i
remember
in
the
transcript
it
shows
that
he'd
been
taken
some
trips
in
the
moving
van
and
in
fact
the
day
that
--
when
he'd
gone
out
somewhere
in
maryland
to
look
for
a
job
and
--
but
no
permanent
fixed
occupation.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
that's
the
--
that's
the
theory
on
which
it
was
constructed.
yes,
sir.
though
there
are
some
other
portions
that
might
be.
though
--
though
most
of
them
are
here
as
a
printed
record.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
no
his
testimony
--
his
testimony
was
the
same.
all
i
was
suggesting
is
that
--
that
he
stood
along
and
assessing
the
man
as
a
moron.
that
everybody
else
that
had
anything
to
do
with
him
on
this
day
testified
that
he
was
bright
and
alert,
cooperative.
his
own
testimony
as
your
read
it
here
in
the
record
suggests
a
relatively
high
degree
of
ability
to
verbalize
concepts
and
to
respond
to
questions.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
well,
at
--
at
2:30
or
3
o'clock
he
was
somewhere
between
15
and
45
minutes,
the
longest
estimate
is
45.
the
petitioner
says
30
to
45
and
then
it
was
an
hour
and
a
half
that
he
was
with
officer
mccarthy
in
the
room
with
the
polygraph
at
which
apparently
about
20
to
25
minutes
was
consumed
with
asking
questions
while
he
was
hooked
up
to
the
machine.
he
was
asked
the
questions
ahead
of
this
and
after.
then
after
that
hour
and
a
half
when
he
had
confessed
to
officer
mccarthy,
then
other
officers
were
brought
in
and
he
repeated
his
confession
to
them.
now,
the
record
doesn't
disclose
quite
how
long
that
took,
apparently
10
or
15
minutes.
and
when
he
repeated
the
--
the
confession
to
them,
and
then
later
on
he
--
he
repeated
it
to
the
complaining
witness
and
ultimately
he
dictated
to
a
type-writer,
a
written
and
signed
confession
here.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
with
this
intervening
period
of
time.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
that
the
petitioner
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
yes,
the
petitioner's
defense
was
that
he
didn't
remember
anything
that
happened
after
6:30
in
the
evening.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
well,
that
--
he
denied
doing
it,
and
he
testified
that
he
didn't
remember
all
his
confession
business
he
didn't
remember
anything
that
happened
after
6:30.
and
i
don't
know
that
there
was
much
more
than
that.
the
flat
denial,
the
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
not
clear.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
as
i
read
the
--
the
record.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
she
--
she
said,
at
least
in
the
part
of
the
record
that's
here.
she
--
she
testified
that
at
the
time
it
happened,
she
wouldn't
have
identified
the
defendant
as
being
the
same
person
that
had
been
in
the
room
previously.
that
all
she
can
say
was
that
he
fit
the
same
general
description.
now
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
the
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
yes.
the
--
the
way
the
--
the
way
that
confession
went
here,
the
--
the
defendant
avoided
any
question
about
it
simply
by
saying
he
thought
he'd
been
drugged
when
they
gave
him
food
and
drink.
he
didn't
remember
anything
after
6:30
until
he
woke
up
in
the
jail
the
next
morning.
and
therefore,
he
wouldn't
affirm
or
deny
what
had
happened
in
this
intervening
period.
he
said
it
looked
like
his
signature
but
he
couldn't
remember
signing
it
with
someone.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
i
suppose
you
know
what
you
have
to
say
instead
of
we'll
say,
case
of
circumstantial
evidence
here,
apart
from
the
confession
and
especially
if
you
say
apart
from
the
clothes
which
had
seminal
stains
and
so
on
which
were
introduced.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
i
suppose
what
would
be
left,
my
familiarity
with
the
record
here
is
not
all
that
it
might
be
that
entire
record,
but
i
assume
what
would
be
left
was
the
fact
that
he
had
been
in
the
room
with
the
victim
shortly
before
he
conceded
that
and
seen
her
there.
that
he
testified
that
he
was
the
only
person
in
the
adjoining
apartment.
his
brother
or
his
nephews
testified
that
they
weren't
there
at
the
crucial
time.
the
victim
testified
that
she
heard
nobody
come
down
the
wooden
steps
from
which
you
could
infer
that
person
came
in
from
the
apartment.
he
met
the
general
description
of
the
person
who
committed
the
rape.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
i'm
not
sure.
i
don't
think
it
shows
from
the
record.
they
were
evidently
adults.
or
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
well,
our
--
our
contention
on
the
mcnabb
point
here
then
is
that
under
these
circumstances,
a
serious
crime
of
violence
had
been
committed.
the
police
had
reasonable
grounds
for
suspecting
one
or
three
persons,
either
the
nephews
or
the
petitioner
had
committed
this
crime.
the
police,
upon
arresting
the
petitioner
could
not
very
well
have
taken
him
immediately
before
a
magistrate
and
singled
him
out
to
file
a
complaint
that
he
was
the
person
who
had
done
it.
they
couldn't
have
done
it
with
anyone
of
the
three
at
the
point
at
which
they
brought
him
in.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
that
apparently
the
only
people
(inaudible)
the
record,
the
only
people
that
were
suspected
were
the
--
were
the
petitioner
and
his
two
nephews.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
and
they
were
all
there.
they
were
all
three
interrogated.
they
all
consented
to
the
lie
detector
test.
they
all
took
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
--
the
lie
detector
test.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
well
--
apparently
they
were
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
oh,
i
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
oh,
i
don't
mean
in
that
room.
i
mean
in
the
--
in
the
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
--
police
station,
in
the
detention
room.
they
were
in
and
out
but
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
well,
that
the
--
the
father
of
the
nephews,
the
brother
of
the
petitioner
was
the
janitor.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
and
that's
why
he
lived
there.
and
the
petitioner
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
no,
i'm
not
sure.
the
record
doesn't
answer
this,
but
i
get
the
impression
that
the
brother
wasn't
suspected.
maybe
he
didn't
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
maybe
he
didn't
--
maybe
he
didn't
met
--
meet
the
general
physical
description.
that
i
don't
know.
it
was
the
two
nephews
and
his
two
sons,
in
other
words
and
the
defendant,
petitioner
here
who
were
the
suspects.
now,
under
these
circumstances,
to
say
to
the
police
that
you
have
to
either
not
take
these
people
in
and
question
them
or
you
have
to
pick
one
out
and
taking,
and
file
a
charge,
a
complaint
against
them
before
a
commissioner.
they
weren't
in
the
position
to
do
this.
now,
this
is
not
like
upshaw.
in
the
upshaw
case,
you
had
a
different
situation.
you
had
the
police
suspecting
an
individual,
had
the
policeman
of
the
court
know
or
was
testifying
that
the
reason
they
held
this
individual
is
to
get
a
confession
from
him.
here
you
have
a
different
situation.
you
have
three
logical
suspects.
the
reason
the
police
did
what
they
did
here
was
to
try
to
eliminate.
there,
about
the
only
investigative
technique
left
to
the
police
in
this
case
at
this
time
was
to
question
the
suspects.
they
weren't
going
to
get
physical
evidence
that
would
pick
anybody
out.
they
were
going
to
be
no
eyewitnesses.
and
so
they
were
questioning
these
three
people
who
logically
might
have
committed
the
crime
under
these
circumstances.
i
assume
that
the
petitioner
never
confessed.
that
--
that
on
--
as
a
result
of
the
questioning
the
police
have
then
let
loose
the
two
nephews
and
charged
him
with
the
crime.
that
there
wouldn't
be
as
much
feeling
about
illegality
as
there
is
here
because
he
ultimately
did
--
he
ultimately
did
confess.
there
are
lots
of
other
situations
which
are
just
similar
to
this
one.
the
police
for
example,
a
man
is
shot
in
the
street.
officers
rushing
to
the
scene
may
see
two
or
three
people
running
away.
maybe
somebody
in
the
crowd
says,
"he
shot
him,
he
shot
him."
under
the
circumstances
they
have
to
make
an
arrest.
and
they
have
to
make
some
inquiry
before
they
take
the
step
of
filing
a
formal
charge
against
one
of
these
individuals
with
the
crime.
it
seems
to
be
generally
conceded
by
most
of
the
authorities
that
--
that
there
is
a
necessity
for
some
amount
of
investigation
in
this
kind
of
a
situation.
now,
there
may
be
serious
questions
as
to
how
best
it
should
be
done.
the
government,
of
course,
is
sympathetic
with
the
--
with
the
underlying
purpose
of
the
mcnabb
rule.
we
recognize
the
evils
of
secret
interrogation,
the
evils
of
the
--
of
the
third
degree.
but
we
suggest
however,
to
apply
the
mcnabb
rule,
purely
mechanically,
is
only
a
question
of
time.
it
goes
too
far
and
rules
out,
confessions
that
are
--
or
rules
out,
it's
not
just
that
it
rules
out
confessions
but
brand
this
illegal,
perfectly
reasonable
police
practices
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
beating
up
the
man
in
the
back
room.
this
case
is
--
is
a
good
example.
it
could
not
be
said
that
the
petitioner
here
was
held
incommunicado.
that
he
was
secreted
in
the
back
room.
he
was
held
out
in
the
--
with
his
nephews,
apparently
with
his
brother
in
the
offices
of
the
police.
the
only
time
in
which
he
could
be
said
to
have
been
taken
off
into
the
back
room
is
the
hour
and
a
half
that
he
spent
with
the
polygraph
operator
and
where
the
--
he
was
questioned
in
this
--
this
small
room.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
well
--
well,
the
government
are
--
the
government's
position
here
is
that
it
would
certainly
be
a
--
a
drastic
change
in
law
enforcement
practices
and
we
suggest
it's
nothing
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
there's
nothing
in
what
was
said
or
decided
in
mcnabb
or
upshaw
which
carries
it
as
far
as
the
contention
made
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
and
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
this
case
i
think,
your
honor,
is
a
good
example
of
the
situation
in
which
if
you
don't
permit
police
interrogation
of
the
suspects,
you
don't
convict
people.
you
get
often,
these
cases
where
the
resources
of
the
physical
evidence
of
eye
witnesses
are
exhausted
and
--
and
what
you
have
left
is
the
need
for
some
names
under
which
the
police
can
interrogate
these
people.
they
--
they
had
to
talk
to
these
three
people
in
the
interest
of
the
society.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
but
presumably
if
--
if
only
his
lawyer
told
him
that,
the
police
would
still
have
the
evidence
that
they
received
from
the
statements
of
the
people
who
were
not
guilty,
in
this
case,
the
two
nephews.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
but
it
would
tend
to
prove
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
that
the
commissioner
did.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
no,
but
--
but
their
stories
about
where
they
were
which
could
be
checked
about
where
they
saw
the
petitioner
and
so
on
are
all
related
to
the
--
to
the
issue
of
--
of
guilt.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
don't
know
how
you
answer
--
answer
the
--
the
how
long.
i
would
assume
that
what
would
be
proper
here
would
be
a
reasonable
amount
of
time
which
might
be
30
minutes
or
two
hours,
i
suppose,
depending
on
the
circumstances
and
how
complicated
the
situation
was,
for
getting
the
stories
of
the
people.
now,
the
police
were
in
the
position
of
having
gotten
each
--
each
man's
story.
and
it
was
at
that
point
that
the
suggestion
was
made
that,
will
you
be
willing
to
take
the
lie
detector
test?
presumably,
the
two
that
were
innocent
felt
they
had
nothing
to
lose
by
taking
the
lie
detector
test
and
i
suppose
perhaps
the
force
of
circumstances,
the
guilty
man
maybe
was
forced
under
the
circumstances
to
consent
too,
because
he
was
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
yes.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
yes.
he
--
he
said
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
yes.
well,
so
that
we
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
well,
i
didn't
say
that
the
response
proved
it.
i
merely
said
that
--
that
after
the
initial
brief
period
of
questioning,
the
--
the
only
thing
that
went
on
beyond
this
came
because
everybody
said,
"we
want
to
prove
we're
innocent.
we'd
like
to
take
the
lie
detector
test."
beyond
this,
the
police
--
the
holding
was
all
for
that
purpose.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
well,
we
say
that
--
that
the
delay
here
was
necessary.
that
it
depends
on
how
you
construe,
of
course,
the
word
"necessary."
the
earlier
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
oh,
we
don't
take
the
position
that
far.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
we
take
the
position
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
facts
of
each
case
to
determine
whether
the
delay
in
this
particular
case
was
necessary
or
unnecessary
within
the
meaning
of
the
rule.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
the
government's
position
is
that
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
the
government's
position
is
that
in
-
on
the
fact
of
this
case
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
--
they
would
have
had
no
duty
to
take
him
to
the
commissioner
even
though
he's
been
in
the
room.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
not
as
far
i
know,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
no.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
actually
the
problem
here
it
seems
to
me
stems
from
the
fact
that
we
haven't
had
an
exercise
of
either
statutory
or
rule
making
power
to
spell
out
precisely
what
it
is
the
police
ought
to
be
able
to
do.
many
authorities
have
contended
over
the
years
that
there
should
be
some
regularized
procedure
for
questioning
suspects.
that
maybe
it
should
be
done,
some
suggestions
have
been
made
that
it
should
be
done
by
the
commissioner.
other
suggestions,
the
uniform
arrest
act,
for
example,
suggested
that
the
police
should
--
that
the
police
should
be
able
to
take
the
man
before
the
commissioner
and
the
commissioner
should
have
discretion
to
release
him
to
the
custody
of
the
police
for
up
to
48
hours
for
reasonable
investigation
before
the
police
would
have
the
necessity
to
file
a
--
a
complaint.
we
haven't
had
either
to
rule
making
or
to
the
legislature
a
careful
spelling
out
of
what
ought
to
be
done.
now
--
now
we
suggest
that
the
--
that
the
position
of
society
is
not
just
the
police
who're
suspecting
here.
obviously
the
interests
in
society
are
that
we
ought
to
apprehend
people
who
commit
rape,
other
serious
crimes.
obviously
the
privacy
of
the
victim
here
was
very
severely
debated
and
perhaps
there
was
a
risk
of
the
privacy
of
other
women,
would
--
would
be
invaded.
and
that
we
have
to
balance
in
all
of
these
cases
the
public
interest
in
reducing
private,
illegal
invasion
to
privacy
among
the
public.
now,
i
recognize
that
public
officers
are
obviously
held
to
a
higher
standard,
but
we
suggest
that
what
was
done
here
doesn't
offend
the
moral
sense
and
that
it
was
certainly
not
clear
to
--
to
the
police
here,
for
example,
that
what
they
were
doing
was
a
violation
of
law.
as
we
point
in
our
brief,
almost
without
exception,
the
courts
of
appeals
since
mcnabb
and
upshaw
have
recognized
in
the
cases
the
necessity
for
some
detention
other
than
that
absolutely
necessary
to
take
the
man
before
a
magistrate.
and
there's
a
whole
string
of
cases
in
this
circuit
and
other
circuits
where
the
police
have
--
where
the
courts
have
not
applied
the
mcnabb
rule
in
that
literal
mechanical
sense
that
--
that
the
only
thing
is
relevant.
such
an
application
has
certain
curious
circumstances,
too,
unrelated
to
the
policy.
if
you
couldn't
find
a
magistrate
the
24
hours,
presumably
then
the
police
could
question
a
man
for
24
hours
as
long
they
didn't
interfere
with
the
voluntary
rule.
but
in
another
case
where
you
could
find
one
in
five
minutes,
you
couldn't
question
him
at
all.
and
this
doesn't
seem
to
be
the
--
the
correct
solution
to
--
to
the
problem
that's
involved
here.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
well,
really
all
we
know,
i
suppose
is
that
the
previous
statutes
that
you
set
out
in
a
footnote
on
page
22
of
the
government's
brief
talked
in
terms
of
taking
him
forthwith
before
some
judicial
officer
or
the
person
arrested
shall
be
immediately
taken
before
a
committing
officer.
now,
the
--
the
other
people
have
out
that
the
legislative
history
here
originally
was
more
in
terms
of
cutting
down
on
the
expense
money
that
the
commission
--
that
the
police
got
by
taking
them
long
distance
is
to
arraignment
rather
than
in
the
problem
we're
dealing
with
here
but
that's
beside
the
point.
when
the
rule
5
(a)
was
promulgated,
it
didn't
use
forthwith
it
didn't
use
immediately.
it
used
unnecessary
delay.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
they
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
yes.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
now,
well,
we
--
we
--
the
government's
position
is
that
unnecessary
must
be
interpreted
to
mean
something
other
than
purely
this
physical
time
mechanical
rule
how
long
does
it
take
to
(voice
overlap)
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
well,
all
we
have
is
the
word.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
all
we
have
is
the
word
unnecessary.
and
--
and
we
can
contend
we
--
our
contention
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
but
that
didn't
deal
with
the
problem
we're
faced
with
here.
that
is,
the
proposal
there
was
to
--
to
say
if
you
don't
take
the
man
within
this
period,
whatever
it
is,
you
have
to
exclude
the
confession.
and
that
ultimately
didn't
get
in.
but
that
didn't
deal
with
the
question
of
what's
meant
by
unnecessary.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
i
--
i
don't.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
well,
essentially
our
position,
and
i
suppose
i
should
touch
on
the
other
points
here.
essentially
our
position
here
is
that
the
consequences
to
law
enforcement
the
--
are
--
are
the
mechanical
interpretation
would
be
such
that
we
don't
think
that
the
court
should
take
that
step.
that
if
you
have
suggestion
of
coercion
for
the
whole
or
psychological
course,
the
confession
goes
on.
that
if
you
have
the
--
the
mcnabb
kind
of
a
--
i
mean
the
upshaw
kind
of
situation
where
the
police
pulled
a
man
in
and
questioned
him
for
30
hours
as
they
say
for
the
sole
purpose
of
getting
a
confession.
we
can
see
that
the
mcnabb
rule
applies.
but
though
we
say
that
there
are
other
cases
of
which
this
is
an
illustration
where
this
shouldn't
be
applied
that
---
that
it
should
be
said
that
it's
reasonable
for
the
police
to
engage
in
brief
periods
of
investigation
which
resulted
in
this
case
in
bringing
two
suspects
and
holding
one.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
in
part.
it's
a
question
of
the
motive
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
--
and
how
they
did
it.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
oh,
we
don't
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
but
the
government's
position
isn't
based
solely
on
the
conscientiousness
of
what
the
police
did.
i
mean
we
take
the
position
that
the
courts
have
to
look
not
only
at
motive
but
what's
actually
right.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
the
--
the
government's
position
is
that
the
--
the
alternative
should
not
be
the
mechanical
rule
that
is
suggested
here
that
some
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
--
exercise
of
the
rulemaking
powers.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
yes.
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
and
--
and
then
there
was
a
paragraph
--
this
was
not
--
the
written
confession
itself
is
not
on
this
record.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
he
was
an
officer.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
all
we
know
is
what's
here
plus
what
the
--
the
opening
paragraph
of
the
--
of
the
confession
have
the
usual
statements
about
the
--
the
man
was
advised
of
his
rights.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
yes.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
that's
right.
frankly
i
don't
remember
whether
the
--
the
written
confession
went
beyond
and
specifically
mentioned
counsel
or
not.
it's
not
in
this
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
not
on
this.
it's
--
it's
not
in
the
printed
transcript.
no,
sir.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
the
only
thing
that
there
--
is
what
--
that
i'm
aware
of
that
there
is,
your
honor,
there
is
a
--
a
provision
with
respect
to
that
under
rule
46
(b)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
there's
a
provision
which
says
that
if
the
police
think
that
a
witness
is
about
to
flee
the
jurisdiction,
they
may,
upon
a
proper
showing
to
secure
order
placing
him
under
bail
or
if
he
fails
to
give
bail
detaining
him.
but
again
that
doesn't
deal
with
the
question
of
--
of
their
right
to
question.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
i'm
aware
of
--
of
no
statute
that
deals
with
the
question
beyond
--
really
beyond
the
bill
of
rights
and
that
--
that
specifically
set
out
a
procedure
and
for
interrogating
witnesses
under
these
---
these
circumstances.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
normally
i
would
assume
that
would
be
unreasonable.
that
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
here,
you
have
three
young
men
who
presumably
could
easily
disappear.
in
fact
two
of
them
did
disappear
overnight.
and
the
police
had
to
go
out
and
look
for
them.
they
didn't
stay
home,
to
find
them,
to
question
them.
they
had
to
engage
evidently
in
detective
work
to
find
these
people
to
--
to
bring
them
in
for
the
purpose
of
questioning.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
there
was
--
there
was
some
testimony
in
the
--
in
the
record
by
--
it's
not
in
this
printed
record
here,
with
respect
to
somebody
saw
a
colored
man
with
certain
clothes
and
description
leaving
the
apartment
house.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
the
petitioner
himself
testified
that
he
left.
that
his
--
that
his
brother
said,
"you
better
--
better
go.
the
police
are
looking
into
this
crime."
one
of
his
nephews
testified
that
the
brother
had
suggested
that
he
and
the
petitioner
make
themselves
scared
because
the
police
were
--
were
around
investigating
this
crime
which
had
taken
place
just
outside
their
apartment.
on
the
question
of
the
search,
say
just
a
moment,
it
seems
to
the
government
the
problem
here
is
quite
different
from
the
problem
where
you
have
a
man
held
in
custody.
he
denies
that
he
committed
the
crime.
he
has
said
--
asked,
"will
you
consent
to
search
your
premises?"
and
he
says
yes.
this
essentially
was
the
judge
in
the
higgins
case
from
which
the
petitioner
rely.
here
it
was
more
like
the
mitchell
case.
this
court
decided
where
it
was
only
after
the
defendant
had
confessed
to
the
crime
so
that
he
had
made
his
confession
to
the
crime
that
he
then
having
confessed
the
crime
said,
"now,
i
let
you
search."
and
he
signed
a
written
consent
so,
it
was
explicit.
there
wasn't
any
problem
to
that
to
search.
so,
we
--
we
say
that
the
--
the
search
stands
or
falls
really
on
the
confession.
that
--
that
had
once
having
voluntarily
made
a
confession
of
the
crime,
this
was
essentially
what
happened
in
the
mitchell
case,
he
confessed
and
then
he
said,
"you
can
go
and
--
and
get
this
evidence."
now,
on
the
question
of
the
jury,
position
of
the
government
here
that
the
judge
did
probably
the
only
thing
he
could
have
done
--
once
the
jury
had
asked
a
question.
now,
we
say
you
can't
say,
petitioner
said
that
the
jury
was
not
concerned
with
this
issue.
congress
in
its
wisdom
had
seen
fit
to
--
to
create
the
situation
where
the
penalty
for
the
crime
is
either
an
indeterminate
sentence
for
10
to
30
years
or
death.
the
jury
decides
whether
or
not
it
shall
be
death.
the
judge
then
decides
if
they
don't
say
death,
what
--
what
it
shall
be
up
to
a
maximum
of
10
to
30.
well,
of
course,
the
jury
is
sentencing
here.
the
jury
is
deciding,
"shall
this
man
die?"
but
it
seems
to
us
that
the
jury
could
not
rationally
decide
that
issue
without
knowing
the
alternatives.
and
once
the
jury
asked
the
question
that
they
did
here,
it's
clear
that
they
were
speculating
on
the
alternatives.
what's
going
to
happen
to
this
man
if
we
don't
give
him
the
death
penalty?
and
can
be
it
said
that
it's
more
of
a
prejudice
to
defendant
to
have
speculation
without
fact
or
--
or
to
give
them
the
fact.
now,
as
we
find
out
in
the
footnote
in
our
brief
on
page
39,
crow
against
united
states
which
this
court,
it
was
up
on
certiorari
on
another
point.
this
court
provided
certiorari.
you
have
the
situation
come
up
and
--
and
the
judge
points
us
the
other
way.
he
refused
to
ask
--
answer
the
jury's
questions
about
probation.
the
jury
wouldn't
have
him
against
the
for
death
penalty
anyway.
now,
this
is
not
the
kind
of
a
case
where
we
can
see
that
you
do
work
the
kind
of
a
case
where
the
instruction
is
apt
to
(inaudible)
the
issue
of
reasonable
doubt.
that
is
where
the
jury
is
interested
in
--
is
in
seeing
well
if
we
find
him
guilty,
he
maybe
able
to
get
off
in
five
years.
and
well
we're
not
really
sure
whether
he
did
but
it's
only
five
years,
so
we'll
find
him
guilty.
this
--
this
one
is
that
kind
of
a
case.
the
petitioner
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
what
the
jury
said
was
clear.
they
have
no
question
about
guilt.
this
wasn't
a
question
about
being
reasonable
doubt
as
to
guilt.
their
ultimate
finding
i
suppose
was
that.
that
what
they
were
concerned
with
is,
"do
we
give
him
the
death
penalty?"
and
on
the
winston
case,
the
court
said
they
could
consider
the
broad
spectrum
and
--
and
the
government's
position
is
that
--
that
most
certainly
that
they've
asked
the
question.
that
they
have
raised
the
issue
that
they
have
come
into
the
court
and
said,
"will
he
be
held
for
his
natural
life
only?"
the
judge
did
here,
the
only
reasonable
thing
to
do.we
suggested
that
if
he's
--
if
he
had
refused
to
do
this
and
the
death
penalty
had
been
convicted,
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner
could
with
as
much
reason
perhaps
have
argued
that
that
was
prejudicial
to
the
defendant
under
the
circumstances.
arguing
then
that
well,
maybe
they
thought
he
would
only
get
two
years
or
five
years.
so,
you
wouldn't
know
what
they
thought
his
--
his
ultimate
period
of
incarceration
would
be.
so,
our
contention
essentially
then
is
that
--
that
once
they
made
the
issue
was
certainly
irrelevant
that
the
issue
they
would
decide,
should
the
man
die?
and
this
can't
be
decided
solely
in
terms
of
the
--
of
the
crime
and
the
nature
and
the
circumstances
as
the
jury
is
bound
to
want
to
know
if
there's
evidence
here,
what's
the
alternative?
now,
it
may
be
that
the
unfortunate
thing
here
is
that
congress
fixed
these
alternatives
so
far
apart
and
that
--
and
that
the
--
perhaps
that
is
the
--
maybe
if
the
alternatives
had
been
life
and
death,
the
court
would
have
found
that
the
jury
would
not
have
found
death.
but
that's
that
fault
of
--
of
the
statute,
not
with
what
the
judge
did
here.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
i
suppose
so,
but
i
don't
think
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
--
that
is
prejudicial.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
yes,
yes.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
yes.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
of
course,
we
don't
know.
but
on
the
face
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
--
of
it
i
think
it
was
just
certainly
reasonable
to
--
to
say
that
the
jury
must
have
been
thinking
at
this
time
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
crime,
they
didn't
want
this
man
released
in
the
hopes
and
the
fear
that
there
might
be
another
similar
crime
and
that
this
was
what
was
back
of
their
question.
now
i
don't
suppose
--
we
take
the
position
this
is
not
improper.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
that
--
that
the
jury
in
a
sense
when
you
give
the
jury
this
power,
this
is
one
of
the
things
they're
bound
to
consider.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
yes,
yes.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
yes,
sir,
except
there
is
some
--
i
suppose
some
distinction
should
be
drawn
at
the
point
which
the
judge
states
them.
i
mean
the
question
of
whether
he
should
do
it
with
the
original
charge.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
yes
or
--
or
whether
he's
attempting
to
resolve
the
question.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
and
our
--
and
our
position
is
that
--
that
given
the
inevitability
of
the
jury
considering
this
question
that
--
that
the
defendant
is
less
prejudiced
by
them
having
accurate
information
than
they
--
than
the
defendant
would
be
about
your
speculation.
certainly
you
cannot
say
that
playing
it
other
way
would
not
be
the
right
--
giving
any
the
death
penalty.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
no,
sir.
but
certainly
obviously
limits
on
how
far
this
can
go.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
oh,
we
don't
face
that
here.
our
--
the
government's
feeling
is
that
certainly
that
the
defendant
would
have
--
petitioner
would
have
a
better
argument
there
because
the
judge
would
be
raising
the
issue,
putting
it
in
effect
in
the
jury's
mind.
here,
we
--
we
know
it
was
in
the
jury's
mind.
and
the
judge
didn't
put
it
there.
and
the
only
question
here
is
what
really
was
it
seriously
prejudicial
to
the
defendant,
once
it
was
in
the
jury's
mind
and
the
jury
had
asked
the
question
to
them
go
to
the
--
to
give
them
the
information.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
well,
i
assume
that
the
--
that
the
only
question
here
is
the
general
question
of
whether
what
happened
here
was
unduly
prejudicial
to
--
to
the
defendant.
and
i
--
i
don't
suppose
we
can
answer
that
in
terms
of
the
rights
of
the
judge.
we
have
to
answer
it
in
the
terms
of
--
of
in
what
the
judge
do
--
that
it's
the
judge's
action
here
given
the
circumstances
a
--
a
prejudicial
action.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
our
position
would
be,
no.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
if
that's
as
far
as
he
went.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
well,
for
that
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
that
i
think
the
government's
position
that
--
i
--
i
can't
say
what
position
the
government
would
take
on
that
point.
but
certainly
the
defendant
would
have
a
better
argument
than
he
has
here
of
prejudice,
simply
because
here,
it
was
the
--
he
would
then
be
putting
the
parole
system
into
the
minds
of
the
jury
for
their
consideration
affirmatively.
here,
the
jury
raised
the
issue.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
which
is
the
right
to
(inaudible)
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
now,
on
another
question
that
was
asked
when
mr.
bryant
was
here.
we
assume
that
--
that
if
this
case
is
--
would
--
were
reversed
on
the
issue
of
the
charge
here,
it
would
have
to
be
retried.
but
the
statute
confers
upon
the
jury
the
discretion
of
deciding
whether
or
not
that
shall
be
given.
and
it
certainly
cannot
be
said
here
as
a
matter
of
law
the
jury
was
wrong
in
giving
the
death
penalty.
and
that
if
the
case
goes
back,
presumably,
it
will
have
to
be
retried
before
another
jury
and
give
them
an
opportunity
to
exercise
the
--
the
discretion
that's
involved
here
because
there
seems
to
be
--
it
seems
--
it
seems
to
be
a
difficult
case
and
needs
to
separate
these
two
things
out
since
under
the
statute,
the
jury
has
the
discretion
to
decide.
and
it's
not
the
kind
of
a
case
in
which
an
appellate
court
can
say
as
a
matter
of
law
they
should
have
decided
it
the
other
way.
it's
just
like
any
other
case
where
there
was
an
error
committed
and
it
--
it's
found
to
be
prejudicial,
it
would
then
go
back.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
there
are
no
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
that's
right
on
this
last
point.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
not
that
i'm
aware
of.
