does
it
not

get
down
to
this
whether
the
question
--
the
question
number
two
with
107
of
the
record
was
proper
to
be
answered
in
any
circumstances?
do
you
say
that
if
it
was
to
be
answered
at
all
that
judge
holtzoff
could
have
done
better
or
anyone
else
than
he
did?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
it
was
to
be
answered
at
all,
you
think
it
could
have
been
answered
better
than
judge
holtzoff
did
answer?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker

do?
justice
charles
e.

it
shouldn't
have
been
asked?

that's

that
thing
i
will
answer.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
jury?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
is
the
jury's
reaction
but
it
might
have
put
your
record
in
a
little
better
position?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker

not
evidence
