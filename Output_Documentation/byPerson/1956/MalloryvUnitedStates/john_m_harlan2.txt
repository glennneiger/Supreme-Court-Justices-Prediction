justice
john
m.
harlan
i
noticed
that
the
last
question
that
the
jury
asked
was,
"may
the
jury
have
a
reading
of
the
d.c.
code
rewrite?"
that
was
one
of
their
questions.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
then
the
court
proceeded
to
read
the
statute.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
did
he
say
anything
more
in
his
preliminary
explanation
than
was
contained
in
the
reading
of
the
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
part
that
we've
been
talking
about.
now,
the
part
on
his
--
it's
a
part
of
his
answer
to
the
jury's
earlier
question
that
you
objected
to.
that
simply
is
summarization
of
the
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
do
you
object
to
the
view
--
supposing
the
court
had
said,
"i
will
not
answer
your
question
except
to
say
that
i
--
to
read
you
the
statute
in
response
to
your
last
question,"
would
you
--
objected
to
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understood
you
to
say
that
you
objected
to
the
answer
that
the
court
gave
to
this
in
--
but
i
don't
find
that.
where
is
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
i
misunderstood
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
when
--
when
the
questions
first
came
in
and
as
the
record
says,
i
want
to
show
you
gentlemen,
meaning
counsel
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
a
note
that
i
received
from
the
jury.
i
think
as
to
the
question
they
asked
on
number
two.
i
shall
have
to
say
that
i
cannot
give
them
any
such
assurance,
mr.
mclaughlin,
that's
the
district
attorney.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
is
right
and
nothing
further
appears.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
he
gave
but
you
didn't
say
anything?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
not
saying
that
you're
bound
by
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out.
justice
john
m.
harlan
they've
been
interrogating
in
the
morning
of
the
two
nephews?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
does
a
part
of
the
record
includes
as
to
the
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
were
to
say
it's
a
question
of
the
motive
of
the
police.
