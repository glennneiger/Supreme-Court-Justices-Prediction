justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
mr.
bryant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
a
statement
of
what
the
law
is
in
that
regard,
do
you
need
to
quarrel
with
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
would
you
suggest
should
have
been
judge
holtzoff's
answer
to
that
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
bryant,
i
--
i
gather
then
that
you
would
probably
distinguish
in
a
state
statute
as
i
think
as
the
case
in
some
states
where
the
verdict
of
guilty
carries
automatically
the
death
penalty
unless
there's
an
affirmative
recommendation
of
life
imprisonment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
and
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
distinction
you
draw
here
is
that
a
verdict
without
the
appendage
with
the
death
penalty
automatically
leaves
to
the
judge
a
determination
of
what
the
sentence
shall
be,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
there's
some
in
new
jersey
i
know.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
only
thing
that
bothers
me
about
that,
mr.
bryant.
if
i
understand
your
position,
it's
a
jury
determination
and
i
suppose
is
an
integral
part
of
the
judgment
of
conviction
that
the
death
sentence
should
be
imposed,
isn't
it
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
how
--
how
can
any
but
the
jury
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
excuse
me,
mr.
bryant,
i
don't
follow
that.
how
could
there
be
a
compromised
verdict?
as
i
understand
it,
unless
unanimously
they
attach
the
death
penalty
to
the
verdict,
automatically
he
gets
only
imprisonment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
couldn't
be
a
compromise.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
didn't
--
it
didn't
result
in
a
compromise.
i
gather
your
position
is
that
it
was
an
intrusion
in
the
sense
that
it
led
the
jury
unanimously
to
the
finding
of
death
penalty
that
--
but
for
what
he
said
that
--
at
least
there
may
have
been
a
disagreement
upon
in
which
he
fairly
could
not
have
had
more
than
imprisonment,
isn't
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
what
was
done
is
an
official,
improper
--
if
that's
a
good
english,
intrusion
under
the
function
of
the
jury
which
vitiates
because
of
its
prejudice
to
the
verdict
of
death.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
point
to
the
place
in
the
record
where
you
first
did,
mr.
bryant,
without
too
much
trouble
or
--
don't
use
your
time
doing
it
now
if
you
can.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
all
right.
i
get
it,
you
have
provided
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
were
you
suggesting,
mr.
barrett,
that
the
original
record
would
indicate
a
difference
in
dr.(inaudible)
testimony
over
the
findings?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
barrett,
is
there
any
background
to
the
phraseology
of
this
rule
to
indicate
that
unnecessary
delay
contemplated
the
circumstances
under
which
the
delay
was
incident
to
an
investigation
after
an
arrest?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
just
looking
at
it,
on
the
face
of
the
rule,
would
not
unnecessary
delay
appeal
reasonably
as
meaning
only
that
the
police
upon
an
arrest
to
then
use
due
diligence
in
locating
a
committing
magistrate
and
nothing
else?
the
circumstance
you
mentioned,
there
might
be
a
magistrate
some
hundreds
of
miles
distance,
the
nearest
one,
does
this
contemplate
though,
every
effort
should
be
made
upon
arrest
immediately
to
get
him
to
a
committing
magistrate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
face
of
it
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
all
we
have
to
go
by.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
just
among
them.
why
do
say
that?
well,
is
it
directing
in
the
rule
would
suggest
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
a
question
before
you
leave
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
this
--
earlier,
mr.
barrett,
you
suggested
at
page
42
though
was
an
indication
at
least
before
the
confession
was
signed,
he'd
been
advised
to
something.
now,
is
there
anything
in
that?
i
guess
you're
going
to
refer
to
us
--
refers
to
what's
at
the
bottom
of
42
and
the
top
of
43,
were
you
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
what
i
wanted
to
ask
you
was
this
witness
testified.
i
don't
know
who
he
was.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
before
he
signed
--
but
before
the
statement
was
reduced
to
writing,
he
was
advised
of
his
rights.
now,
at
that
time
he
wasn't
advised
of
his
right
to
be
represented
by
counsel
was
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
at
the
top
though
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
of
page
43.
this
witness
goes
on
to
say,
we
told
him
that
the
statement
would
have
to
be
voluntary.
we
put
it
down
on
his
own
words
so
the
statement
could
be
used
for
or
against
him
in
court
and
he
agreed
to
give
the
statement.
now,
that's
all
that
appears
as
to
the
rights
of
which
he
was
advised.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
a
confession
on
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
tell
me,
mr.
barrett,
on
page
105,
with
the
close
of
his
charge,
on
this
question,
the
judge
says
in
that
event,
the
defendant
will
be
subject
to
imprisonment
which
the
court
will
impose
but
will
not
be
subject
to
the
death
penalty.
suppose
he
said
in
that
event
the
defendant
will
be
subject
to
imprisonment
up
to
30
years
which
the
court
will
impose
but
will
not
be
subject
to
the
death
penalty.
do
you
think
that
would
have
been
error
in
the
charge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
it
would
not
be?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
tell
me,
mr.
bryant,
if
that
interpolation
which
i
suggest
to
mr.
barrett,
had
appeared
in
the
charge,
in
other
words
up
to
30
years
if
they'd
have
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
up
to
30
years.
now,
my
question
is,
do
you
suppose
the
question
which
finally
was
asked
whatever
has
been
asked?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
at
least
i
asked
it
that
way.
don't
you
suppose
that's
--
there's
at
least
one
possible
inference
from
the
form
of
the
jury's
question
that
the
jury
has--
and
a
fact
that's
cited
that
if
this
man
would
be
kept
imprisoned
for
the
rest
of
his
life,
they
wouldn't
give
him
the
chair.
but
if
he
was
not
to
be
imprisoned
for
the
rest
of
his
life,
then
they
would
bring
in
the
death
penalty.
at
least
isn't
that
final?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
unless
on
that
interpretation
of
it
that
the
judge
had
said,
"i
can
sentence
him
up
to
30
years."
there
would
not
have
been
any
necessity
to
ask
a
question,
would
there,
because
in
that
event
they
don't
have
the
information
they
wanted
without
asking
the
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
why?
that's
the
next
question
that's
been
asked.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i'm
getting
back
now.
the
--
the
--
suppose
all
that
have
been
done
here
was
that
the
charge
had
added
up
to
30
years.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
that
have
been
wrong?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
will
be
subject
to
imprisonment
up
to
30
years.
up
to
30
years,
would
there
also
have
been
prejudicial
errors?
