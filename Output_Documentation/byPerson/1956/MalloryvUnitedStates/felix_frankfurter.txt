before
--
may
i?
justice
felix
frankfurter
excuse
me
for
interrupting
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
if
we
had
no
more
than
that
what
you
read
on
page
105
mr.
bryant,
have
you
or
have
you
not
a
quarrel
with
that
--
that
portion
of
the
initial
charge
made
by
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
that's
--
that's
not
all
right,
difficulty
arises
on
the
response
to
the
subsequent
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
do
i
infer
from
your
answer
to
justice
brennan
that
you
imply
or
that
you
--
you
--
we
should
carry
the
meaning
of
what
you
say
that
in
as
much
as
--
as
the
amount
of
the
--
in
as
much
as
the
way
in
which
the
judge
exercises
the
discretion
other
than
capital
in
the
sentence
that
the
jury
tells
particularly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
shouldn't
tell
him
what
will
influence
them
because
that
may
influence
them
in
bringing
in
one
sentence
rather
than
another?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
in
as
much
as
they
have
that
awful
power
which
they
have
under
statute
in
various
mistakes
of
deciding
whether
a
man
should
go
to
his
death
or
not,
are
they
themselves
on
how
they
--
how
that
should
be
put
to
them
--
are
they
themselves
entitled
to
consider
suppose
a
jury
brought
in
a
verdict
saying
we
find
the
defendant
guilty
and
we
think
and
we
recommend
death
because
of
inevitable
speech
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
they
shall
because
we
think
that
you
ought
not
to
be
alleged
inside
the
community
very
soon
as
he
will
might
be
but
--
what
will
you
say
to
that
kind
of
a
verdict.
now,
that
is
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
illegal
verdict?
they
gave
their
reasons
from
closing,
for
qualifying
the
--
or
adding
to
their
finding
of
guilty,
the
reason
for
recommending
for
opposing
death
as
the
power
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
can't
they
--
your
argument
must
imply
that
they
cannot
get
some
guidance
from
the
court
for
consideration
that
they
may
as
a
perfectly
conscientious
jury
take
into
account
in
the
privacy
of
the
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
answer
they
got
from
the
judge,
what
the
judge
said
is
something
that
they
could
discuss
among
themselves.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
secrecy
and
privacy
of
the
--
the
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
proposition
--
you
stand
on
the
proposition
that
the
judge
has
no
business
to
help
from
defining
--
expounding
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
understand
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
may
say
so,
that
is
the
position
to
take
but
i
just
want
to
know
if
that's
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
now,
forgive
me
for
this
question
because
i
have
a
great
deal
of
sympathy
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
will
you
forgive
my
question
because
i
have
a
great
deal
of
sympathy
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
from
your
point
of
views.
it
comes
from
a
friendly
source.
suppose
--
suppose
the
jury
instead
of
having
asked
the
question
they
did
asked
had
specifically
trained
this
question,
we
are
honored
to
tell
us
whether
it
is
a
fact
that
even
though
you
impose
the
maximum
sentence
under
the
existing
parole
legislation
or
whatever
an
existing
laws,
it
doesn't
follow
that
the
defendant
will
have
to
serve
the
maximum
sentence.
he
may
serve
a
much
less
sentence
in
view
of
--
he
could
behave
inside.
couldn't
he
be
allowed
to
answer
that
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
none
of
your
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
other
hand,
the
jurors
are
trying
conscientiously
to
discharge
their
duty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
have
the
power
of
bringing
in
a
death
penalty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
let's
view
the
--
and
they
want
to
know
by
what
consideration.
it's
not
a
consideration
in
harm
and
reflection
should
guide
them
in
making
that
awful
judgment.
and
--
and
if
they
--
i
wonder
if
they
merely
ask
that
there
isn't
a
difference
between
asking
a
specific
fact
which
can
be
answered
in
a
specific
way
in
making
a
little
speech
like
this
old
speech
as
to
which
is
calculated
as
you
argue,
is
calculated
to
make
them
realize
this
fellow
may
observe
law.
isn't
there
a
difference?
you
were
raising
a
very
--
you
were
raising
a
very
--
to
my
point
of
view
a
very
far-reaching
question
as
administration
of
formal
justice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
winston
--
the
winston
case
really
was
a
strong
into
measuring
or
at
least,
hence
in
a
murder
case
anything
that
the
trial
court
judge
said
that
to
my
point
of
view
is
strong
and
important,
anything
than
--
everything
that
resorts
at
great
length.
but
in
the
winston
case,
this
court
said
in
effect,
and
if
i
may
say,
just
quite
right
to
--
but
the
judge
practically
told
them,
"you
ought
to
bring
a
death
sentence
unless
you
got
a
good
reason
for
not
doing
so."
that
--
that
will
be
effectuating
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
can't
do
that,
this
isn't
quite
right,
this
isn't
that
the
crime.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
effect
was
the
same.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
really
think
is
that
they
cut
there
deep
into
the
whole
conception
went
out
to
the
jury,
what
you
really
think
is
that
the
contradiction
or
deny
what
i've
put
to
you
earlier,
can't
they
get
some
rational
guidance
from
the
judges
to
how
they
should
exercise,
what
is
their
power
maybe
to
them
before
the
death
sentence
that
what
you're
really
saying
is
this
had
better
be
lasting
all
in
what
you
will,
the
feeling,
the
hunch,
the
--
the
--
some
total
human
feeling
of
these
12
people,
men
and
women
whether
this
fellowship
goes
to
a
death
or
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
better
not
have
any
inclusion
of
any
kind
of
enlightenment
from
the
court
on
that
subject.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
a
--
i'm
a
little
troubled.
didn't
the
jury
ask
the
question
that
the
--
on
--
in
quote
on
top
of
page
107?
justice
felix
frankfurter
didn't
they
ask
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
wasn't
that
there
a
question?
was
there
not
that
question?
did
they
not
put
those
very
words
to
the
judgment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
jury,
isn't
it?
under
the
jury
verdict?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
an
evidence
covered
by
your
answer
to
justice
whittaker
that
the
jury
didn't
ask
for
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
i
misunderstood
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
evidence,
supposing
he
answered,
just
said
no.
can
we
be
--
the
jury
be
assured
defendant
legally
be
imprisoned
for
the
remainder
of
his
natural
life?
supposing
he'd
said
no,
you
would
have
the
same
--
you
would
object
to
that,
wouldn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
you
complained
but
this
is
different.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
answer
which
the
judge
gave
technically
are
not
--
not
with
reference
to
your
problem.
is
it
technically
correct
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
at
the
situation
of
the
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understand
it.
but
i
mean
this
is
technically
correct.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
if
it
was
technically
wrong,
i
wouldn't
bother
along
with
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
that
i
follow
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
except
one
more
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
--
suppose
one
should
find
that
he
--
that
one
should
agree
with
you
speaking
of
consequences,
it
would
have
to
go
back
for
--
it
wasn't
tried,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
couldn't
impose
the
sentence,
of
course,
and
the
old
jury
couldn't
be
called
back.
and
it
--
well,
could
it
--
i
don't
know
what
do
you
suggest
or
either
by
you
or
by
the
government
that
could
--
that
the
case
suddenly
sends
back
to
vacate
the
death
sentence
and
impose
the
life
sentence.
i
don't
know
what
the
government
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
one
might
have
to
face
that
question
if
one
agreed
with
you,
wouldn't
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
except
that's
a
difficult
question
for
me
was
when
i
--
it
doesn't
seem
irrational
to
me
to
say
the
death
sentence
was
improperly
imposed?
the
death
sentence
is
vacated
to
the
finding
of
guilty
that
you
do
the
best
you
can.(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
they
said
nothing
that
the
jury
brought
in
guilty
then
--
then
it
wouldn't
be
death?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
may
go
even
further
than
that.
they
go
even
further
than
that.
one
doesn't
have
to
know
much
about
juries
to
know
that
there
may
be
jurors
on
that
jury
who
would
say,
"i'm
ready
to
find
him
guilty
if
he
isn't
sentenced
to
death."
justice
felix
frankfurter
"but
i'd
hold
out
against
the
verdict
of
guilty."
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
to
insist
on
technically
trying
there
is
alternative,
he
may
be
switched
over
from
voting
for
acquittal
to
guilt?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
not
an
unknown.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
that
the
delay
was
chosen.
it
was
designed
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
design
delay.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
please
refer
us
or
quickly
state
what
the
evidence
in
the
record
is
for
that
statement?
what
is
the
--
on
what
do
you
based
that
statement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
time
was
he
arrested?
when
was
he
convicted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
the
commissioner
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap),
what's
the
geography
of
the
commissioner's
home?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
commissioner
that
we
know
--
whether
the
commissioner
sitting
in
his
office,
is
he
there
particularly
available?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
position
of
the
district
have
a
good
deal
of
business
or
that
he
--
did
he
get
a
full
time
job
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
he's
on
a
full
time
on
a
yearly
salary
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
nothing
about
this
but
i
should
think
washington
is
big
enough
to
have
a
commissioner
who's
there
on
full
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
suggest
that
he
should
be
presumably
there
until
4:30
anyhow?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
not
a
wild
assumption,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
exact
time
when
--
when
this
defendant
was
brought
into
police
headquarters?
justice
felix
frankfurter
3
o'clock?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
district
judges
are
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
district
judges
are
there
at
the
district?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
all
in
that
building
over
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
--
are
defendants
ever
taken
before
at
the
district
court
arraigned?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
district
court's
--
the
district
judges
take
arraignments
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
you
can
break
in
toward
a
particular
case?
i
mean
there's
an
arrest
at
3
o'clock
and
a
conscientious
district
attorney
could
take
him
to
even
the
commissioner
or
he
isn't,
for
some
reason,
there
or
busy,
you
could
take
him
to
the
municipal
court
as
such
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
say,
“your
honor,
i
have
a
case."
is
that
all
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
trouble
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
municipal
court
judges
are
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
more
question,
mr.
bryant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
--
on
this
court
--
on
this
aspect
of
your
case,
unlawful
illegal
detention,
the
mcnabb
one
part.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
properly,
technically
preserve
your
--
your
claim
of
error
as
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
raise
it
early?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
they
challenged
the
other
question?
have
they
said,
you
haven't
--
the
question
that
justice
harlan
put
that
you
did
not
object
to
the
answer
by
the
trial
judge?
did
the
government
raise
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
you
mean
by
saying
the
failure
to
arraign
was
designed
in
order
to
enable
him
to
get
the
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
there
is
cause
for
arrest,
there
must
some
cause
for
arrest
and
there
is
the
question
of
--
is
that
sufficient
cause
for
detention?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
soon
as
the
--
there
is
cause
for
arrest,
to
justify
the
arrest,
he
should
be
brought
before
a
magistrate
and
then
the
government
could
say,
"your
honor,
we
want
this
witness
at
all
events
detained
until
we
can
ascertain
if
anybody
is
guilty
of
a
crime."
at
least
sufficient
evidence
to
prosecute
him
and
further
whether
there
is
sufficient
evidence
to
--
to
prosecute
these
fellows
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
therefore,
we
want
him
detained.
but
you
were
saying,
the
essence
of
the
mcnabb
rule
is
that
you
can't
hold
him
until
you
find
out
whether
you've
got
enough
on
the
fellow.
that's
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
saying
that
you
say
you
reject
--
you
--
you
challenge
that.
that's
right,
i
challenge
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
whole
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
you
can't
just
arrest
a
fellow
with
sufficient
expectation
or
suspicion
or
--
or
feeling,
knowledge,
probable
cause
to
arrest
him
and
then
keep
him
there
until
you
get
out
of
him
what
you
want
and
make
out
a
case.
that's
your
case,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
ask
you
one
question
before
you
take
your
seat,
mr.
bryant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
record
give
details,
particulars,
to
substantiate
your
statement
that
the
defendant
here
was
at
disadvantage,
a
person
of
limited
capacity?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
finishing
what
they
did
with
the
nephews?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
picked
up
without
a
warrant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
did
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
mr.
,
when
did
the
lie
detector
machinery
and
its
operator
turn
it
up?
justice
felix
frankfurter
six
o'clock.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
he
subjected
to
this
--
was
the
defendant
subjected
at
once
to
the
machine
or
--?
justice
felix
frankfurter
probably
in
the
meantime
about
--
the
--
the
victim
wasn't
called
in
for
identification
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
anything
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
the
defendant
was
advised
of
his
right
to
counsel
or
was
--
anything
on
that
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
he
confronted
with
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
arraignment
or
after?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
arraignment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question.
suppose
he
had
declined
to
subject
himself
to
the
lie
detector
or
suppose
he
had
a
lawyer
and
the
lawyer
said,
"don't
you
submit
to
that,"
and
he
--
that
would
have
been
clearly
within
his
rights
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
the
lawyer
had
said,
"don't
you
do
it.
the
lie
detector
is
not
yet
established
as
a
wonderful
scientific
instrument.
there
are
doubts
and
worries
about
the
conditions
under
which
it's
given,
et
cetera.
all
the
things
that
you
and
i
know."
that
will
be
all
right,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
we
don't
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
all
i'm
saying
is
that
all
that
period
was
utilized
and
--
and
his
subjection
to
this
--
to
this
prosecutorial
--
i'm
not
questioning
any
--
prior
to
this
prosecutorial
intention
that
about
having
any
counsel
on
his
side
or
any
advice
or
any
knowledge
of
what
his
rights
were.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
want
to
delay
your
conclusion.
you
can
draw
from
it.
but
will
dispose
in
a
word
of
the
character
of
this
defendant.
do
you
agree
or
disagree
with
mr.
--
that
the
general
impression
that
mr.
bryant's
statements
left
on
with
me
especially
the
kind
of
a
person
you
were
dealing
with.
justice
felix
frankfurter
whose
--
whose
witness
--
whose
psychiatrist
was
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
appointed
by
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
his
trial
was
before
the
government
(inaudible)
wasn't
it?
when
was
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
sure
either.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
didn't
mean
so
much
his
actual
mental
state.
but
as
the
record
disclose
(inaudible)
the
record
discloses
education
is
what
kind
of
stability?
i
don't
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
psychological.
was
he
pending
on
that
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
old
is
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
19?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
he
have
a
permanent
occupation?
did
anything
appear
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
defense,
mr.
barrett?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
infer
from
what
you
said
that
he
took
the
stand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
don't
mean
on
this
issue.
i
mean
the
defense
on
the
merits?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
on
the
identification
--
identification
by
the
victim.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
clear?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
asked
that
question
because
some
of
the
cases
--
indeed
this
court
points
out
--
has
pointed
out
that
(inaudible)
towards
alleged
errors
of
this
one
finding,
may
be
influenced
by
the
--
by
the
certainty
of
a
--
the
convincingness
of
proof.
justice
felix
frankfurter
assuming
there's
enough
to
go
the
jury
anyhow.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
there
are
two
different
questions.
what
i
was
just
referring
to
is
the
--
the
certainly
or
the
confidence
in
which
one
can
say,
guilt
was
established
by
the
proof
apart
form
the
confession.
not,
the
confidence
one
can
have,
the
confession
is
valid.
i'm
saying
that
the
case
is
--
i
think
has
indicated
pretty
clearly
that
makes
a
difference
how
you
feel
about
diversity.
how
solid
the
proof
is
on
--
on
controverting
--
controvertible
the
proof
is,
on
the
merits
apart
from
the
contested
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
old
are
these
nephews,
mr.
barrett?
does
that
appear
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
did
you
say
a
little
while
ago
that
the
nephews
or
one
of
them
wasn't
in
the
rule
of
the
three?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
could
they
have
been
then
suspected
if
--
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it
had
to
be
one
of
the
three
in
that
room?
justice
felix
frankfurter
detention
room.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
conceded
the
three
people
or
wasn't
one
of
the
three,
the
janitor?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
three
--
so
that
the
potential,
the
possible
defendant,
possible
--
guilty
people
was
the
janitor,
this
--
his
brother
and
a
nephew?
justice
felix
frankfurter
wasn't
suspected?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
barrett,
as
you
well
know,
mcnabb
isn't
merely
concerned,
wasn't
concern
merely
with
a
fellow
being
beaten
up
in
the
back
room.
it
was
concerned
primarily
that
occasion
be
made
out
against
the
defendant
to
his
--
to
himself.
now,
of
course,
if
you
got
beating
up
from
the
back
room
that
night,
everybody
is
used
to
that.
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
mcnabb
rule
was
intended
very
considerably
to
change
conventional
methods
of
law
enforcement.
that's
the
point
of
the
rule.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
maybe.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
wasn't
merely
a
rule
designed
to
prevent
physical
violence
as
a
mode
of
extorting
confession.
that
was
precisely
indicated
that
that
was
not
the
reason
for
it
or
even
for
it
and
it
didn't
want
to
create
circumstances
as
i
indicated
in
which
you
get
stuff
out
of
the
defendant
and
have
--
instead
of
having
the
government,
the
prosecutor
generally
go
about
the
business
in
establishing
through
resourceful
energy
and
imagination
and
enterprise,
a
case
other
than
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
defendant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
saw
it
here.
the
fellow
had
a
lawyer
who
told
him,
you
don't
open
your
mouth.
you
--
the
police
wouldn't
have
(inaudible)
up
their
head
and
said,
"we
can
file
about
this
case."
wouldn't
they?
i
shouldn't
imagine
that
responsible
police
would
do
that.
they
will
--
if
he
can't
get
it
out
of
his
own
mouth,
therefore
we
stop
doing
anything.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
the
police
went
on
--
at
least
prove
the
nephews
didn't
do
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
wouldn't
be
--
you
could
put
that
in
a
proof
in
the
trial.
at
least
three
fellows
were
in
the
room,
the
two
others
have
been
established
and
are
innocent
ergo,
this
fellow,
you
may
find
guilty.
you
don't
suggest
that
freely,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
thought
the
record
showed
that
he
was
eager
and
some
--
the
government
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
relies
on
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
government
(inaudible)
said
he
was
eager
for
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
that
responsiveness
to
a
request
to
take
a
lie
detector
proved
innocence
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
have
a
little
more
than
that.
we
had
great
conflict
within
the
advisory
committee
whether
mcnabb
should
be
made
into
a
rule.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
that
doesn't
--
couldn't
give
a
definition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
part
--
but
--
but
the
--
what
meaning
you
give
to
defense
and
fundamentally
what
your
attitude
is
toward
this
problem
and
that's
the
great
division
in
the
cases
below.
articulated
this
jurisdiction
where
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
some
of
the
law
of
0court
judges
have
specifically
with
mcnabb,
the
plaintiff's
(inaudible)
status.
isn't
it
in
their
own
writing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
know
that
in
this
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
that's
--
if
i
may
say
so
your
difficulty
with
the
rule
you
were
tending.
once
you
say
reasonable
as
against
mechanical.
i
don't
think
those
are
the
(inaudible)
if
it's
reasonable,
then
what
you
said
of
them
a
while
ago
that
this
was
done
with
--
they
never
thought
they
were
doing
anything
illegal.
they
had
self-consciousness
of
doing
right.
(inaudible)
is
true
but
that
leaves
it
open
to
the
police
authorities
to
hold
on
without
presenting
him,
that
without
arraignment
so
long
as
they're
satisfied,
they're
doing
something
conscientious
if
you
please.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
merely
--
not
merely
in
fixing
guilt
on
the
suspect,
but
in
establishing
whether
he
is
guilty
lest
they
hold
an
innocent
man.
and
that
means
that
these
conscientious
police
officials
might
have
taken
two
days
to
establish
that
he
was
or
wasn't
the
--
the
potential
--
i
mean
the
criminal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
was
--
what
was
the
criteria
that
it
was
a
reasonable
thing
for
police
to
do
in
order
to
ascertain
whether
this
fellow
was
there
or
he
wasn't
there?
that
leaves
out
of
the
count
a
whole
--
maybe
for
myself.
the
central
concept
of
our
prosecutorial
system
and
the
central
concept
that
arraignment
intervened
in
order
to
have
the
magistrate
tell
the
fellow,
"you
can
keep
your
mouth
shut.
you
don't
have
to
say
a
thing.
do
you
want
a
lawyer?
this
is
a
capital
offense.
i'll
give
you
a
lawyer."
all
that
is
taken
out
and
put
into
the
discretionary,
conscientious
judgment
of
the
police.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
forthwith
was
stricken
out.
that
forthwith
is
that
you
give
it
to
kind
of
meeting
as
justice
brennan
said,
that
means
that
once
you
must
(inaudible)
into
it
and
there
is
stuck
in
there
a
judgment
that's
unnecessary
mainly
in
relation
to
the
function.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
barrett,
tell
me,
is
that
unfair?
is
it
unreasonable
that
--
improper
for
the
--
intellectually
improper
for
me
to
say
that
the
innuendo
of
the
jury's
question
was
perfectly
plain?
can
we
the
jury
be
assured
that
the
defendant
legally
be
imprisoned
for
the
remainder
of
his
natural
life?
is
it
--
is
it
--
am
i
entitled
with
intellectual
honesty
to
say
what
was
behind
that
question
is
perfectly
plain?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
mean
--
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
ask
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
to
ask
you
--
i
didn't
mean
to
ask
them
question.
what
i'm
asking
you
is
--
is
that
because
they
have
--
they
have
to
wait?
is
it
fair
to
say
that
that
jury
wanted
--
the
question
was
supported
by
the
jury
in
order
to
get
reassurance
that
they
can
be
--
that
they
can
be
assured
that
you
--
am
i
entitled
to.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
why
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that's
--
that's
really
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
this
case
imposes
the
court
with,
doesn't
it?
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
--
that's
what
i
think
ultimately
the
question
we
get
to
whether
the
jury
is
entitled
in
a
case
like
this
to
have
this
court's
state
with
accuracy
relevant
items
in
having
the
jury
makes
up
its
mind.
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
a
fair
statement
on
what
we're
up
against?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
i'm
assuming
this
case,
there's
nothing
about
it
and
they
asked
that
question
which
i
think
you're
happy
to
be
right
in
this
question
naturally
may
bounce
into
their
into
heads
and
then
the
question
is,
assuming
you
gave
them
accurate
answer
should
we
give
them
give
an
accurate
answer
if
we've
have
and
we
got
no
problem.
if
he
has
this
is
your
entitlement
to
get
that
aid
from
the
court
under
this
kind
of
a
statute.
that's
really
what
they're
asking.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
we
--
certainly
the
jury
can
tell
me
and
then
ask
the
judge
for
a
lot
of
the
instructions
or
statements
of
accurate
statement
on
his
part
helping
them
to
make
their
thinking
more
relevant,
more
rational
and
more
disciplined.
and
certainly
we
wouldn't
allow
him
to
say,
"well,
i
think
looking
at
this,
this
is
a
fact."
he
couldn't
do
that
could
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
i
mean
even
as
the
things
that
would
help
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
the
parole
board.
they
just
want
to
get
generally
how
much
--
how
soon
is
this
fellow
likely
to
get
outside?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
--
may
i
ask
if
that
--
are
there
any
authorities
on
this
last
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
it's
your
logical
analysis?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
there's
no
--
there
are
no
--?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
our
case
is
a
little
different.
our
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
case
is
a
little
different.
