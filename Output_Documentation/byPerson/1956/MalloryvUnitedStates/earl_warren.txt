mr.
bryant.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
bryant,
oh,
pardon
me,
just
go
right
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
bryant,
i
suppose
implicit
in
your
argument
is
the
--
is
the
fact
that
the
colloquy
of
this
kind
is
--
there's
a
vise
in
it
because
it
--
it's
likely
to
produce
a
compromised
verdict
and
that
that
being
true,
any
--
any
verdict
that
--
that
was
brought
about
as
a
result
of
such
a
colloquy
is
subject
to
the
--
the
criticism
that
it
might
be
--
it
might
be
a
compromised
verdict.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
talking
about
compromise
in
this
--
in
this
sense.
some
of
the
jurors
might
have
been
for
the
death
penalty.
some
of
them
might
have
been
for
--
for
life
imprisonment.
and
--
and
those
who
were
for
the
death
penalty
might
have
said,
"well,
if
we
could
--
if
we
could
be
sure
that
he
would
stay
in
jail
for
the
rest
of
his
life,
we
will
--
we
would
find
him
guilty
of
--
of
the
offense
punishable
less
than
death.
but
unless
we
can
be
assured
of
that
fact,
we
will
go
with
the
other
group."
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
a
deal,
it's
a
compromise.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
that
sense
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that's
--
that's
the
sense
i
used
to
deal.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
bryant,
are
you
going
to
find
time
to
discuss
the
first
question,
the
question
of
the
detention?
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
what
page?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
they
also
have
taken
him,
did
you
say,
to
the
municipal
judges?
chief
justice
earl
warren
has
the
government
challenged
the
fact
as
to
whether
you
did
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
the
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
bryant,
had
you
concluded
your
opening
remarks?
chief
justice
earl
warren
had
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may
have
some
more
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
sir.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
barrett.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
would
that
help
--
would
that
help
any
if
other
suspects
were
in
at
the
questioning?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
thought
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
thought
all
of
them,
they
picked
up
were
suspects.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
record
just
doesn't
disclose.
part
--
there's
nothing
in
the
printed
record,
the
original
record
that's
on
file
with
the
court
shows
that
the
other
nephews
were
brought
in
at
some
point
during
the
morning
--
they
testified
that
they
were
brought
in
to
the
police
station
during
the
morning.
but
that
--
that
we
assume
they
were
questioned.
but
the
record
isn't
clear.
this
wasn't
brought
into
focus
in
the
trial.
now
the
petitioner
was
brought
in
and
he
was
questioned,
the
officer
said
15
to
30
minutes,
he
said
30
to
45
minutes.
after
this
questioning
he
was
taken,
this
had
been
--
taken
place
apparently
in
the
identification
bureau.
he
was
then
taken
to
the
sex
squad
office
where
in
the
presence,
he
testified
of
his
brother
and
his
two
nephews,
the
police
asked
them
if
the
three
of
them
would
consent
to
take
a
lie
detector
test
to
determine
apparently
who
was
telling
the
truth.
petitioner
in
his
testimony
doesn't
question
the
voluntariness
of
his
consent
to
take
a
lie
detector
test.
and
the
nephews
testified
that
--
that
they
were
asked.
and
they
all
agreed
to
take
the
lie
detector
test.
now,
all
of
the
delay
after
this
time
was
consumed
in
waiting
for
the
officer
to
arrive,
who
gave
lie
detector
test
and
in
giving
the
test
first
to
the
two
nephews
and
finally
to
the
petitioner.
the
brothers
alone
--
fuzziness
on
this
issue,
the
--
the
record
seems
to
bear
out
statement
that
from
about
4
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
until
8
o'clock
when
the
petitioner
was
taken
in
for
the
lie
detector
test,
he
sat
on
a
chair
in
the
sex
squad
office
with
one
or
both
of
his
nephews.
it's
not
clear
whether
his
brother
was
there
all
or
part
of
the
time.
he
was
apparently
there
at
the
beginning
of
this
period.
they
were
given
food
and
drink.
they
received
no
other
guarding.
and
that
was
implied
in
sitting
in
the
back
of
an
office
where
police
were
coming
and
going.
we
don't
contend,
of
course,
they
were
free
to
leave.
there's
no
question
about
that.
and
while
there's
a
little
conflict
on
this,
most
of
the
evidence
suggests
that
they
weren't
questioned
during
this
time.
petitioner
himself
said
that
he
didn't
remember
any
questioning
during
this
period.
they
just
sat
in
the
office
and
waited.

of
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
a
letter.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
not
--
suppose
you
took
--
suppose
you
took
out
of
the
case
the
confession
that
he
gave
and
the
evidence
that
was
obtained
by
the
search
of
the
house
that
you
say
was
a
part
and
parcel
of
the
same
conversation
while
he
was
detained.
what
would
be
left
in
the
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
i
understand
mr.
bryant
to
say
they
were
also
bringing
in
other
people
for
this
same
crime?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
barrett,
if
he
had
not
gone
on
the
lie
detector,
how
long
would
you
say
that
they
could
have
kept
him
in
this
same
condition
and
still
have
the
government
here
in
court
saying
that
it
referred
to
be
proper?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
what
do
you
with
the
language
of
the
statute
that
says
when
he's
arrested
he
shall
be
taken
without
unnecessary
delay
to
--
to
a
magistrate?
what
do
you
do
with
that
language?
chief
justice
earl
warren
by
necessary
--
by
necessary,
unnecessary
delay,
you
mean
that
they
can
take
him
and
hold
him
as
long
as
they
are
investigating
him
and
need
to
do
so
in
order
to
determine
whether
he
committed
this
crime
or
not,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
the
commissioner
was
right
there
at
the
time
in
building
or
in
--
in
the
room,
would
you
have
been
justified
in
not
arraigning
him
or
not
to
--
not
to
bring
him
(inaudible)--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
until
such
time
as
you
--
you
might
have
completed
the
investigation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there's
no
contention
that
this
man
was
not
arrested
is
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
barrett,
if
you
were
dealing
with
some
crime
that's
obviously
or
apparently
obviously
a
neighborhood
crime,
would
you
be
justified
in
--
in
taking
all
the
young
men
who,
in
the
neighborhood
who
might
have
been
--
been
suspected
of
this
crime
taking
them
to
the
jail
and
--
and
holding
them
there
under
arrest
until
you
had
an
opportunity
to
--
to
examine
them
and
determine
whether
they
are
guilty
or
--
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
is
the
difference?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
between
that
case
and
this.
you
--
you
knew
one
--
only
one
person
committed
this
crime.
you
arrest
three
persons
on
some
theory
or
other
and
take
them
to
--
you
take
them
to
the
police
station
and
you
hold
them
there
until
you're
satisfied
that
two
of
them
didn't
do
it
and
one
of
them
did.
now
what
is
the
difference
between
that
and
the
one
i
put?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
--
suppose
the
judges
put
that
in
his
charge,
would
have
been
all
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
has
the
judge
the
right
to
say
anything
to
them
after
they
have
been
charged
and
they've
gone
into
the
jury
room
that
he
wouldn't
have
been
authorized
to
--
to
tell
them
in
the
charge?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
he
went
farther
and
said
that
the
parole
board
may
--
may
release
him
much
sooner
even
--
even
on
one
third.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
he
could
stand
of
one
third
of
the
sentence
of
30
years?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
bryant.
chief
justice
earl
warren
take
your
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
more
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
mr.
bryant,
before
you
take
your
seat.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
court
notices
from
the
record
in
the
case
that
you
came
into
the
case
by
appointment
of
the
district
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
you
have
carried
this
case
through
for
an
impecunious
defendant
through
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
and
we
would
have
you
know
that
we
consider
this
a
distinct
service
to
the
cause
of
justice
regardless
of
what
the
outcome
of
this
case
might
be.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
bryant,
the
court
said
it
doesn't
detract
one
wit
from
the
service
you
rendered
the
cause
of
justice
through
your
representation
of
the
government
in
this
very
serious
case.
