mr.
william
b.
bryant
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
for
the
court,
andrew
mallory
versus
united
states,
we
believe
presents
three
important
questions.
the
first,
whether
or
not
the
lower
courts
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
properly
adhered
to
the
pronouncements
of
this
court
in
mcnabb
versus
united
states
and
reiterated
in
upshaw
versus
united
states
relative
to
alleged
confessions
of
the
petition.
number
two,
i
believe
that
the
important
question
is
whether
or
not
the
consent
allegedly
given
to
the
police
by
the
petitioner
herein
for
the
search
of
his
home
for
certain
items
of
clothing
while
he
was
arrested
and
then
the
police
headquarters
measured
up
to
that
standard
of
voluntariness
which
the
federal
jurisdiction
has
adopted
for
itself.
and
thirdly,
whether
or
not
the
trial
court's
comment
in
answer
to
a
question
by
the
jury
after
deliberating
some
four
or
four
and
a
half
hours
about
the
fate
of
the
petitioner
in
the
event
that
the
jury
did
not
impose
a
death
penalty,
was
proper
under
the
circumstances.
now,
the
factual
picture
which
--
out
of
which
these
questions
arises
is
briefly
as
follows.
on
april
7th,
1954,
a
woman
was
allegedly
raped
in
the
1200
block
of
12th
street
northwest
in
the
district
of
columbia
in
the
basement
of
an
apartment
house
in
which
she
lived.
the
next
day,
at
about
2:30,
the
petitioner
was
arrested
in
the
northeast
section
of
washington
d.c.
and
taken
to
police
headquarters
at
13
indiana
avenue,
northwest.
immediately
upon
his
arrival
at
the
police
headquarters,
he
was
interrogated
in
the
so-called
identification
room
at
the
police
headquarters.
the
arrival
was
pitched
at
about
3
o'clock
in
the
afternoon.
here,
the
petitioner
was
questioned
by
at
least
seven
or
eight
officers
of
the
sex
squad
between
3
o'clock
and
shortly
after
4:00
that
he
--
and
then
some
times
between
4:00
and
5:00
during
that
questioning,
the
petitioner
denied
any
implication
in
the
crime.
some
times
between
4
and
5
o'clock,
the
police
inquired
of
the
petitioner
and
his
two
nephews,
the
children
of
his
half
brother
who
was
a
janitor
of
the
apartment
which
the
alleged
crime
occurred
and
who
also
in
custody.
the
police
inquired
as
to
whether
or
not
they
would
take
the
lie
detector
test.
petitioner
is
alleged
to
have
agreed
to
take
a
lie
detector
test
along
with
the
other
two
suspects.
the
man
who
was
an
expert
at
giving
the
examination
was
not
immediately
available
and
there
was
a
waiting
period
of
--
from
about
some
time
between
4
and
5
to
about
7
o'clock.
the
officer
eventually
arrived,
and
after
exposing
the
other
two
men
who
were
in
custody
to
the
lie
detector
apparatus
and
the
testing
that
goes
on
with
it,
the
petitioner
was
called
into
the
room
some
120
feet
away
from
the
room
in
which
he
had
been
all
the
time.
and
there,
in
the
lie
detector
room,
which
is
a
small
room
about
the
size
enough
to
accommodate
the
machinery
and
the
examiner
and
the
--
and
the
subject,
he
was
given
the
so-called
“lie
detector
test.”
his
questioning
immediately
before
--
questioning
during
the
--
during
the
examination
at
which
time
he
was
attached
to
the
machinery
by
various
wires
and
hoses
and
other
attachments.
after
the
examination
on
the
machine,
he
was
subjected
to
still
more
questioning
and
some
time
between
9:30
and
9:45
p.m.,
according
to
the
examining
officer,
he
made
certain
oral
admissions
which
implicated
him
in
the
crime.
thereupon,
the
examining
officer
called
the
two
officers
of
the
sex
squad
who
were
in
charge
of
the
case
so
to
speak
and
indicated
to
those
officers
that
the
petitioner
wanted
to
make
a
statement
to
them.
at
that
time,
the
oral
admission
originally
made
to
the
examiner,
speaking
of
the
lie
detector
machine
technician,
were
allegedly
repeated
to
officers
(inaudible)
i
believe.
after
the
admissions
were
made,
one
officer
to
another
said,
“try
to
get
a
hold
of
the
commissioner"
having
reference
to
the
united
states
commissioner
and
then
for
the
district
of
columbia.
a
call
was
put
through
to
the
commissioner
at
his
home
and
he
was
at
that
time
unavailable,
that
was
sometimes
after
10
o'clock
p.m.,
the
first
mention
of
the
commission.
thereupon,
the
petitioner
set
out
under
police
supervision
a
written
statement
embodying
what's
he
had
said
to
the
officers
are.
and
immediately
following
the
written
statement,
there
was
also
a
written
consent
to
the
officers
to
go
to
the
premises
and
search
certain
areas
and
take
from
that
area
items
or
clothing.
the
confessions
are
--
unwritten
were
introduced
an
evidence
over
objection.
the
items
of
clothing
which
had
been
procured
as
the
result
of
the
so-called
“consent
to
search”
and
which
had
been
subjected
to
certain
analysis
by
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
and
which
should
be
--
reveal
certain
culminating
characteristics
were
introduced
to
the
evidence.
the
jury
was
instructed,
when
he
took
the
case,
in
the
usual
fashion
except
that
when
it
got
down
to
the
point
of
the
verdicts
by
virtue
of
the
peculiar
characteristic
of
the
district
of
columbia
statute
which
allows
the
jury
to
add
to
the
verdict
of
guilty
if
they
so
find
the
defendant
who's
charged
with
rape,
guilty.
he
might
add
the
words
with
the
death
penalty.
because
of
that,
judge
holtzoff
read
to
them
the
following,
and
i
--
i
think
that
in
these
circumstances,
i
should
read
the
charge
because
it
is
critical.
beginning
on
page
5
--
page
105
of
the
record,
if
the
court
please,
the
fourth
paragraph
beginning
with
“if
you
find
the
defendant
guilty,
you
still
have
one
more
punishment”,
the
punishment
provided
by
law
for
the
crime
of
rape
is
either
a
death
penalty
or
imprisonment
for
a
term
of
years.
the
decision,
whether
the
death
penalty
should
be
inflicted,
is
made
by
the
jury.
the
jury
has
the
right
in
the
function
of
determining
whether
or
not
the
death
penalty
should
be
inflicted
on
a
rape
case.
consequently,
if
you
find
the
defendant
guilty
as
charged,
you
must
then
decide
also
whether
the
death
penalty
should
be
imposed.
if
you
unanimously
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
death
penalty
should
be
inflicted,
then
you
may
add
to
your
verdict
of
guilty
the
words
“with
the
death
penalty”.
in
such
case,
and
such
as
your
verdict,
it
will
then
be
mandatory
on
the
court
to
impose
the
death
penalty.
the
court
will
have
no
discretion
under
that.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
find
the
defendant
guilty
but
you
do
not
unanimously
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
death
penalty
should
be
inflicted,
then
your
verdict
should
be
simply
guilty
as
charged
without
any
addition
to
it.
in
that
event,
the
defendant
will
be
subject
to
imprisonment
which
the
court
will
impose
but
will
not
be
subject
to
the
death
penalty.
whether
the
death
penalty,
should
or
should
not
be
imposed,
in
case
you
find
the
defendant
guilty
is
entirely
within
your
discretion
and
you
have
a
right
to
consider
any
circumstances
or
weigh
in
his
considerations
in
reaching
the
conclusion
on
that
point.
that
is
the
critical
part
of
the
court's
charge
in
the
light
of
the
question
we
raised
here.
if
the
court
please,
after
deliberating
for
something
over
four
hours,
we've
indicated,
the
jury
indicated
that
it
wanted
some
explanation
or
some
instructions
from
the
court
and
sent
the
court
a
note
which
asks
several
questions.
the
court
deals
with
this
note
on
page
106
of
the
record,
the
court
called
counsel
to
the
bench
and
showed
there's
a
note
indicating
that
the
jury
had
asked
one,
“have
we
other
choice
of
verdicts
than
this
four?”
mr.
william
b.
bryant
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
yes
sir.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
i
have
no
quarrel
with
the
general
brief.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
yes
sir.
the
subsequent
questions,
i
believe,
were
outlined
on
page
106
of
the
record,
have
we
other
choice
of
verdicts
than
these
four.
one,
guilty
with
death
penalty.
two,
guilty
as
charged.
three,
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
four,
not
guilty.
now,
the
court
answered
that
question.
now,
those
four
are
the
only
possible
verdicts,
no
other
verdict
is
possible.
then
the
court
dealt
with
question
number
two.
question
number
two
was,
on
number
two
above
having
reference
to
guilty
as
charged,
"can
we
the
jury
be
assured
that
the
defendant
legally
be
imprisoned
for
the
remainder
of
his
natural
life?
no
possibility
of
release
-
in
his
sentence."
the
court
in
response
to
that
question
said,
"i
can
give
you
no
such
assurance.
i
think
i
might
explain
to
you
that
the
maximum
term
the
court
may
impose
is
30
years,
but
even
if
the
court
imposes
the
maximum,
and
of
course
i
can,
even
if
the
court
imposes
the
maximum,
the
court
also
has
to
impose
a
minimum
sentence.
so
that
the
longest
term
that
the
court
can
impose
would
be
an
indeterminate
sentence
of
10
to
30
years.
the
minimum
has
to
be
not
more
than
a
third
of
the
maximum.
then
at
the
end
of
the
minimum
sentence,
the
parole
board
would
have
to
decide
whether
the
maximum
should
be
served,
or
anything
less
than
the
maximum.
so
that
i
can
give
you
no
assurance
that
the
defendant
would
legally
be
imprisoned
for
the
remainder
of
his
natural
life
if
he's
found
guilty
as
charged.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
no,
sir,
as
a
statement
of
what
the
law
is,
if
your
honor
please,
i
have
no
quarrel
with
it.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
i
think
his
answer
in
the
circumstances
here
should
have
been
that
is
a
matter
which
is
not
properly
before
you
jurors
for
your
consideration
and
i
will
not
answer
that
question.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
positively,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
my
position.
this
isn't
a
case
where
the
jury
is
charged
with
the
duty
of
fixing
punishment
in
terms
of
fixing
death
or
fixing
life
or
fixing
a
term
of
years.
this
is
a
case
where
their
sole
consideration
is
to
determine
guilt
or
innocence
on
the
one
hand
and
then
if
they
determine
that
he
is
guilty,
whether
or
not
he
should
be
--
his
life
should
be
fought.
if
they
decide
that
it
shouldn't
be,
what
happens
to
him
in
the
alternative
is
not
any
--
any
area
in
which
they
can
make
any
consideration.
it's
sheer
speculation.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
i
think
if
he
--
mr.
william
b.
bryant
i
would
say
this,
if
your
honor
please,
that
that
would
be
a
positive
determination
of
death.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right
sir.
that
--
that's
my
position.
then
the
court
--
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
i
--
i
think
that
--
mr.
william
b.
bryant
may
i
take
that
position,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that
is
my
position,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right
your
honor.
in
other
words,
you
take
the
position
in
--
in
the
that
case
that
your
honor
cites
and
i
believe
that
is
so
in
several
ohio
--
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right,
sir,
if
your
honor
please.
well,
in
that
particular
case,
the
jury
is
charged
with
fixing
punishment
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
alternative
and
they
aren't
here
and
another
distinction
is
this,
in
the
wisdom
of
congress,
what
happens
to
a
man
if
the
death
penalty
isn't
imposed
at
the
term
of
years
per
years,
so
they
aren't
be
a
meaningfully
beginning
embedding
an
area
which
is
fraught
with
speculation
from
the
very
beginning.
then
they
asked
for
reading
of
the
rape
statute
and
the
court
at
that
time
reads
the
rape
statute
too
and
reads
the
penalty.
the
court
stated,
may
the
jury
have
a
reading
of
the
d.c.
code,
it
reads
this
way,
whoever
has
come
knowledge
of
the
female
force
have
been
against
their
will
shall
be
imprisoned
for
not
more
than
30
years
provided
any
case
of
rape
the
jury
may
add
to
their
verdict.
if
he'd
be
guilty,
the
words
would
be
death
penalty.
in
which
case,
punishment
shall
be
death
by
electrocution
provided
further
that
the
jury
fails
to
agrees
to
the
punishment,
the
verdict
shall
be
received
and
the
punishment
shall
be
imprisoned
--
imprisonment
as
provided
in
this
section.
now,
as
the
court's
pleases,
i
complained
of
any
answer
at
all
to
the
question.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
sir?
mr.
william
b.
bryant
certainly.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
no,
sir.
beyond
the
place,
i
think
the
prohibition
is
against
that
even
in
cases
where
juries
have
the
right
to
determine
punishment,
let's
say,
in
lesser
offenses
like
driving
while
drunk,
for
instance,
where
the
range
of
punishment
might
be
from
a
$100
to
$1000
fine
and
maybe
from
30
days
to
a
year
in
jail.
the
function
of
the
parole
authorities
is
a
distinct
--
the
executive
functions,
it's
another
branch
of
the
government.
and
what
the
--
what
--
what
--
confidence
the
congress
has
reposed
in
the
wisdom
of
those
persons,
people
who
may
be
even
unborn
should
not
be
frustrated
or
thwarted
by
somebody
anticipating
what
might
be
done.
the
court
properly
should
say
that
that
is
not
--
mr.
william
b.
bryant
none
of
your
business,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
this.
i
think
that
this
court
about
--
gave
the
answer
to
the
question
a
long
time
ago
in
the
winston
cases
which
arose
in
the
district
of
columbia.
and
in
that
--
in
those
cases,
we
have
that
federal
statute
which
said
that
the
penalty
for
murder
in
the
first
degree
would
be
death
except
if
the
jury
should
bring
back
a
verdict
of
guilty
without
capital
punishment.
and
then
at
the
first
few
cases
that
arose
under
that
statute,
a
judge
told
the
jury
that
in
--
if
they
came
to
any
conclusion
that
these
--
that
these
defendants
should
not
be
--
should
not
receive
the
death
penalty
or
if
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
verdict
should
be
without
capital
punishment
that
they
must
find
some
mitigating
circumstances
and
have
some
objective
credited
for
him.
and
this
court
said
that's
not
so.
this
court
uses
the
term
and
the
total
evidence
in
light
of
all
the
evidence.
i
think
that's
a
cue
here,
if
your
honor
please.
i
don't
believe
that
punishment
in
the
alternative
from
the
death
sentence
can
be
properly
construed
as
evidence
in
the
case.
i
--
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right.
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
william
b.
bryant
if
your
honor
please,
i
have
the
--
i
take
the
position
that
it
was
then.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
the
effect
was
the
same,
particularly,
in
the
light
of
these
circumstances,
if
your
honor
please.
if
not
death,
then
there
was
no
life
imprisonment
that
was
30
years.
and
then
with
the
imposition
of
30
years,
the
indeterminate
sentence
law
is
no
part
of
the
statute
on
rape.
it's
a
separate
part
of
the
code,
and
then
when
judge
holtzoff
mentioned
the
indeterminate
sentence
law
and
then
went
to
the
point
of
the
parole
board
having
the
authority
to
determine
that
the
end
of
the
minimum
period
it
need
not
to
serve
anymore
unless
they
see
--
was
in
effect
emphasizing.
now,
the
possibilities
and
probabilities
that
this
young
--
young
man
would
be
out
in
no
time,
so
that
was
the
effect
of
it
that
they
could
not
be
escaped
and
that's
why
i
--
i
said
at
one
point
that
the
arrow
was
sort
of
progressive
arrow.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
to
the
purpose.
excuse
me,
sir.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
i
assert
that
this
is
fiduciary
and
i
think
it
shouldn't
have
been
answered
at
all.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
it
shouldn't
have
been
asked
either,
if
your
honor
please.
it
shouldn't
have
been
answered
at
all
and
the
only
federal
cases
we
had
your
honor,
the
lovely
versus
united
states.
now,
in
the
lovely
case,
it's
true
that
judge
parker
pointed
out
or
it
was
pointed
out
by
someone
that
this
answer
that
--
that
the
court's
charge
relative
to
the
parole
possibilities
on
a
life
term
were
--
were
gratuitously
offered
by
the
court
and
not
in
response
to
an
inquiry.
but
the
language
of
judge
parker
was
to
this
effect.
that's
something
with
which
the
jury
has
nothing
to
do.
i
think
that's
--
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right.
now,
specifically
as
to
your
question
about
judge
holtzoff's
correctness
or
incorrectness
in
answer
to
the
question,
it
seems
to
me,
if
your
honor
please,
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
and
in
the
light
of
the
law
which
had
governs
in
the
district
of
columbia,
death
isn't
imposed,
that
if
he
answered
at
all,
his
answer
should
have
been
confined
to
a
straight
unequivocal,
unelaborated
upon
no.
i'm
saying
this
that
when
he
went
beyond
and
gave
the
jury
the
range
of
what
might
happen
to
this
man,
they
didn't
asked
for
that.
and
the
extent
to
which
he
went
almost
forward
on
advocacy,
he
came
to
the
point
where
he's
injecting
himself
into
that
jury
room.
the
emphasis
upon
the
possibilities
that
at
the
end
of
10
years,
this
man
would
be
in
the
street.
the
jury
didn't
ask
for
that,
if
your
honor
please,
and
i
think
that
it
would
(inaudible)
to
--
to
tell
her
that.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
can
we,
the
jury
be
assured
that
--
mr.
william
b.
bryant
they
asked
--
mr.
william
b.
bryant
yes.
yes,
sir,
that's
--
that's
what
they
asked.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
no,
i
don't
mean
that.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
i
don't
mean
that,
if
your
honor
please.
the
jury
was
not
asking
about
alternative
sentences.
they
were
asking
about
an
assurance
of
something
that
didn't
exist.
they
were
asking
the
--
mr.
william
b.
bryant
i
was
complained
about
that,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
this
is
different.
this
is
worse.
this
is
aggravated.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
it
is
but
--
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that
is
right
but
it's
not
responsive,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right,
sir.
it
would
technically
be
correct,
if
your
honor
please.
as
far
as
it
went,
i'm
saying
that
he
shouldn't
have
gone
as
far
as
he
did.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
now,
some
cases
have
--
mr.
william
b.
bryant
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
your
honor,
i
--
i
would
want
to
venture
to
the
answer
on
that.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
as
it
is
now,
yes,
your
honor.
the
death
sentence
has
become
a
part
of
the
verdict.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
i
participate
some
difficulty
in
that
area,
your
honor.
i
--
i
can
understand
what's
troubling
you.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right.
in
the
finding
of
guilty,
i
don't
think
there's
any
equivocation
about
that.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
in
the
--
you
mean
there
is
no
charge.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that
--
that's
right,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
no,
if
he
read
the
--
the
statute
as
he
did
in
his
original
charge.
the
safe
way
that
judges
usually
adopt
is
to
say
i've
already
instructed
you
on
that
matter
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
if
he
had
said
no
and
then
read
the
statute
without
regard
to
the
punishment,
i
would
have
been
satisfied.
but
i
don't
think
that
that
was
an
area
for
the
jury
to
be
concerned
with
whether
or
not
he
got
30
years
or
10
to
30
or
9
to
27.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
i
think
so,
if
your
honor
please.
that's
my
position.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
well,
i
don't
mean
compromise
in
those
terms,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right.
that's
a
deal
so
to
speak.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
i
mean
--
in
fact
the
jury
say
it's
--
it's
--
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right.
and
i
think
--
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
so
that
this
--
this
i
think
this
--
i
think
in
specific,
the
answer
to
your
question
your
honor
that
--
that
a
jury
in
arriving
in
the
determination
is
great
as
this.
it
shouldn't
impose
the
death
penalty
in
terms
of
negative
reaction.
in
other
words,
the
death
penalty
should
reflect
the
heinousness
of
the
crime
in
certain
things
in
which
it
was
committed
and
not
any
disapproval
of
anything
that
the
congress
in
its
wisdom
has
adopted
as
alternative.
if
that
isn't
their
business,
strictly
isn't
their
business
to
say
this
to
them.
if
it
would
be
improper
--
if
it
were
improper
--
we'll
put
another
way
i
should
say
that
the
court's
original
charge
relative
to
the
law
and
the
jury
response
was
the
extent
to
which
they
should
have
been
informed.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right,
if
your
honor
please.
i
think
--
mr.
william
b.
bryant
i
--
i
--
if
your
honor
please,
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
--
i
don't
think
i
said
that
as
to
the
objective
of
the
introduction
of
the
evidence.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
but
as
to
the
--
and
if
i
did
say
that,
i
don't
mean
that.
but
i
did
make
it
the
basis
for
--
in
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
correct.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right.
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
might
say
this.
that
i
was
in
an
unfamiliar
situation
at
that
point
and
i
said
nothing
as
the
record
reflects.
but
i
assure
your
honot
that
had
i
had
any
idea
that
the
judge
is
going
to
say
what
he
did
say,
i
would
have
just
objected
spontaneously.
he
said,
i'm
going
to
tell
him,
i
can
give
him
the
no,
the
answer
is
no.
i
can
give
no
such
assurance.
i
had
in
my
mind
at
that
time
that
that
wasn't
a
proper
thing
to
do.
but
certainly
if
i
had
any
idea
in
the
world
--
mr.
william
b.
bryant
if
your
honor
please,
i
--
i
felt
helpless
under
the
--
mr.
william
b.
bryant
i
understand
that.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
i
thought
about
that
to
some
extent
but
i
can
imagine
nothing
that
could
have
been
done
in
those
circumstances
that
could
have
protected
--
that
could
have
obviated
it
or
at
least
affected
it.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
yes,
your
honor,
i
agree.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
yes,
if
your
honor
please,
i
would
like
to
complement.
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
that
the
confessions
in
this
case
fall
within
the
prohibitions
of
the
mcnabb
doctrine
for
this
reason.
at
the
time
this
man
was
taken
to
the
headquarters
building
in
question,
he
was
literally
taken
down
a
car
on
one
side
across
the
street
for
15
or
so
judges
of
the
district
court
and
nine
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
united
states
commissioner,
the
width
of
the
street.
a
block
away
was
the
municipal
court
for
the
district
of
columbia,
all
of
the
judges
on
which
are
empowered
to
act
as
committee
magistrates.
now,
the
delay
between
time
of
arrest
and
the
time
that
the
commissioner
was
sought
was
not
a
delay
which
arose
out
of
expensive
circumstances
or
which
the
police
had
no
control,
it
was
a
delay
which
was
chosen
by
the
police
for
the
purpose
of
interrogation.
and
i
think,
if
your
honor
pleases,
that
the
mcnabb
and
upshaw
mean
what
i'm
certain
that
the
court
have
said
that
--
that
they
mean
and
who
file
was
to
be
observed
at
all
that
the
delay
in
this
particular
case
were
such
as
to
invalidate
the
confessions.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
delay
was
chosen.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
well,
i
had
based
that
statement,
if
your
honor
please,
on
the
fact
that
on
--
at
--
in
the
record
on
page
52,
i
believe.
the
police
--
i
am
reading
down
near
the
--
well,
the
third
question
from
the
bottom.
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
on
page
52
of
the
record
where
the
--
mr.
mclaughlin
said,
"we're
calling
your
attention
after
the
defendant
stated
to
you
that
he'd
made
a
verbal
statement.
you
stated
he
made
a
verbal
statement.
was
there
any
attempt
at
that
time
to
get
in
touch
with
the
united
states
commissioner?"
answer,
“yes,
sir.
sergeant
elliot
made
a
call
to
the
home
of
the
united
states
commissioner.
commissioner
was
unavailable."
"and
that
was
approximately
what
time?"
"it
was
some
time
after
10
o'clock."
now,
i
say
that
the
record
reflects
that
this
was
a
matter
of
choice
for
this
reason,
that
he
was
interrogated
then
they
waited
for
the
lie
detector
man
to
come
to
interrogate
him
some
more.
there
was
absolutely
no
reason
indicated
by
the
record
why
he
should
not
have
been
arraigned.
i
say
that
a
test
is
not
the
time
that
--
mr.
william
b.
bryant
he
was
arrested
about
2:30
and
arrived
at
the
police
headquarters,
if
your
honor
please,
which
was
across
the
street
from
these
people
and
about
3
o'clock,
shortly
before
3
o'clock.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
the
commissioner
--
mr.
william
b.
bryant
these
buildings,
if
your
honor
please,
are
directly
across
the
street
one
from
the
other
directly
across
the
street.
the
interrogation
took
place
on
the
fourth
floor
of
this
building
over
here.
in
third,
it
seems
to
be
south
and
northwest.
the
united
states
commissioner's
office
is
in
the
northwest
corner
of
the
new
united
states
district
court
building,
a
third
is
on
market-based,
and
coincidentally,
it
was
about
the
closest
office
to
the
police
headquarters.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
if
your
honor
please,
i
don't
know
what
he
was
--
mr.
william
b.
bryant
the
assumption
is
that
during
the
business
hours
that
he
was.
we
know
--
mr.
william
b.
bryant
he
has
full
time
job,
if
your
honor
please,
on
a
yearly
salary.
and
i'll
say
that
my
experience
both
as
with
the
commissioner,
i
spent
a
lot
of
time
with
him
that
he
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
he
should
be
on
duty
at
least
until
the
judges
were
on
duty
about
4:30.
i
know
that
that
was
a
fact
that
that
was
the
practice
there.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
about
95
--
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right,
your
honor.
his
salary
was
$9500.
i
think
he
was
furnished
a
staff.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
oh
certainly.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
not
--
not
a
wild
assumption.
i
think
that
at
least
they
should
have
attempted
to
get
in
touch
with
him
in
his
office
some
time
before
4:30
rather
than
waiting
until
after
10.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
3
o'clock,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
3
o'clock.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
they
--
they
could
have
taken
him
to
the
municipal
--
municipal
judges
who
i
know
are
in
session
until
after
4
o'clock.
they
could
have
taken
him
to
any
one
of
the
district
court
judges,
there's
always
one
on
duty
at
least
until
the
time.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
sir?
mr.
william
b.
bryant
there
are
13.
there
were
13
of
--
mr.
william
b.
bryant
all
in
that
building,
the
united
states
courthouse,
nine
of
the
court
of
appeals
judges
and
13
district
judges
and
the
united
states
commissioner.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
yes,
sir,
i've
done
it,
if
your
honor
please,
personally
for
the
very
purpose
of
--
of
eliminating
this
contention
and
i
would
say
this
that
the
municipal
court
judges
are
utilized
fully
as
much
as
the
united
states
commissioner.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
oh,
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
no
trouble
and
the
municipal
court
judges
will
make
themselves
available.
they
will
wait
for
you,
late
in
the
evenings,
sometimes
after
5:00.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
there
are
11,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
i
did
throughout.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
i
raised
it
early,
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
when
mr.
--
at
that
trial
court
when
mr.
mclaughlin
mentioned
to
the
court
that
this
is
a
confession
case,
if
your
honor
pleases.
and
i
was
--
mr.
william
b.
bryant
well,
i
can't.
i
need
to
put
my
finger
--
mr.
william
b.
bryant
i
will
need
to
put
my
finger
on
--
mr.
william
b.
bryant
no,
sir.
they
haven't
challenged
it,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
some
references
made
within
the
government's
brief
but
not
a
formal
challenge,
i
believe
in
the
footnote
--
mr.
william
b.
bryant
--
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
well,
if
your
honor
please,
they
had
enough
to
arraign
him
when
they
arrested
him.
now,
if
your
honor
means
if
did
they
have
enough
for
the
commissioner
to
hold
him,
i
think
it's
a
different
question.
i
think
that
purposes
of
arraignment
is
to
determine
whether
or
not
there's
enough
to
hold
him.
i
don't
think
the
police
--
that
was
the
upshaw
rape
case.
the
police
said
it
didn't
they
take
him
there
because
we
didn't
have
enough
for
the
commission
at
a
holding
and
that
was
the
fact
here,
so
that
--
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right,
the
sole
purpose
of
the
delay.
and
i
say
to
your
honor
that
when
the
commissioner
is
available
and
the
arresting
authority
has
failed
to
take
advantage
of
his
availability
for
the
purpose
of
arraigning,
then
that
detention
is
illegal
and
--
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
well,
i
don't
think
there's
any
reason,
if
your
honor
please.
and
when
the
--
when
--
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
the
argument
of
the
government.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
no,
no.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
they
--
they
are
saying
this
that
the
reasons
that
they
didn't
take
him
were
logical
reasons
and
made
the
delay
necessary.
i
say
to
your
honor
that
the
only
necessary
delay
is
the
delay
in
which
the
police
are
not
in
the
position
of
choosing.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
we
ask
the
--
mr.
william
b.
bryant
well
--
well,
i
say
that
that's
police's
position.
that's
not
mine
--
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
you
honor
--
mr.
william
b.
bryant
--
please
i
haven't,
i
believe
--
mr.
william
b.
bryant
--
there's
about
13
more
minutes
--
mr.
william
b.
bryant
yes,
sir.
two
or
three
to
just
one
question,
and
reserve
the
rest
of
the
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
in
reference
particularly
to
the
admission
of
the
evidence
which
was
obtained
pursuant
to
the
so-called
consent
to
service.
i
believe
that
that
evidence
was
illegally
seized
for
this
reason
if
your
honor,
please.i
believe
that
the
petitioner
with
his
particular
characteristics,
his
lack
of
training,
some
grave
question
as
to
what
his
mentality
was,
whether
not
even
psychotic,
no
question
about
him
being
psychopathic,
need
of
background,
his
youth,
strangeness
to
the
city,
being
incarcerated
at
the
time
that
the
so-called
consent
was
given
to
him,
i
think
that
in
this
area
that
the
--
and
voluntariness
within
the
contemplation
of
the
federal
rule
that
consents
to
search
must
be
voluntary
cannot
be
arrived
at
so
that
i
have
a
two-pronged
attack
on
the
consent
to
search.
one
is
that
it
was
a
fruit
of
illegal
detention
and
i
think
that
the
mcnabb
(inaudible)
certainly
or
logically
would
apply
to
anything
gained
as
a
result
of
illegal
detention.
and
then
the
other
side
of
the
coin
that
it
was
not
voluntary
in
the
--
according
to
the
standard
adopted
by
this
jurisdiction.
inasmuch
as
that's
so,
i
think
that
the
evidence
admitted
depends
--
the
trial
wasn't
--
the
defendant
--
that
the
petitioner
who
should
not
have
been
admitted
and
that
their
introduction
was
error
which
should
cause
the
case
to
be
reversed.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
yes,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
the
record.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
at
the
very
outset,
the
testimony
of
the
psychiatrist.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
may
it
please
the
court.
about
two
to
three
minutes
of
my
--
mr.
william
b.
bryant
--
remaining
time.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
as
to
the
business
of
the
instruction,
the
supplemental
instruction,
i
would
like
to
--
just
to
have
one
word
to
say
on
this.
i
think
that
the
cases
which
are
on
the
books
up
to
now
and
the
cases
on
which
the
government
draws
its
rationale
relative
to
the
propriety
of
the
judge
making
comment
about
the
business
of
parole
or
how
soon
he's
going
to
get
out.
have
--
those
cases
have
to
do
with
those
instances
where
the
jury
is
charged
with
the
duty
of
fixing
punishment
as
a
matter
of
fact.
in
this
particular
case,
it
seems
that
the
jury
was
seeking
--
wasn't
seeking
information
about
a
matter
which
was
properly
within
their
(inaudible)
of
consideration.
they
were
not
to
consider
any
alternative
sentences.
actually
what
the
jury
did
by
way
of
--
i
--
i
like
the
term
innuendo.
by
innuendo,
the
jury
was
trying
to
get
a
commitment
from
the
judge
as
to
what
you're
going
to
do
with
him
if
we
don't
kill
him.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
did
wrong,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
well,
they
might
very
well
to
come
in
and
ask
the
judge
then
if
you
give
him
30
years,
is
that
--
does
that
mean
he's
right?
mr.
william
b.
bryant
i
was
looking
for
that.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right.
and
it
would
have
been
highly
--
highly
improper
for
them
to
give
him
that
inference.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
well,
for
this
reason
if
your
honor
pleases.
i
think
that
determining
whether
or
not
the
comment
is
proper
or
not,
we
have
to
analyze
the
due
response.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
well
--
mr.
william
b.
bryant
because
it
is
not
the
--
the
province
of
the
jury
to
know
about
what
the
alternative
punishment.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
certainly,
if
your
honor
please.
and
i
say
this
as
to
whether
or
not
it's
given
to
him
gratuitously
or
in
answer
to
question.
i
think
that
--
mr.
william
b.
bryant
sir?
mr.
william
b.
bryant
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right,
sir.
our
case
is
a
little
different.
now,
just
on
the
mcnabb,
i
want
to
say
one
final
word
on
the
mcnabb
point.
that
it
seems
that
the
history
of
the
committing
--
committing
the
legislation
indicates
the
language
without
unnecessary
delay
would
certainly
be
interpreted
to
--
to
permit
delay
or
procrastination
only
because
of
the
unavailability
of
committing
authorities.
and
i
say
that
for
this
reason.
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
over
a
period
of
time,
they
have
--
there's
been
some
interpretation
of
this
rule
and
one
of
the
judges
or
--
or
two
of
them
has
seen
fit
to
concur
especially
in
some
of
those
cases
for
this
reason.
they
have
determined
that
the
delay
was
not
--
was
not
unnecessary
by
virtue
of
late
evening
arrest
or
sunday
arrest
or
holiday
arrest.
in
other
words,
the
question
of
necessary
is
still
determined
by
the
availability
of
the
commissioner
and
the
element
of
choice.
if
the
authorities
choose
to
delay
for
the
purpose
of
the
interrogation,
then
that
delay
certainly,
is
at
that
time
illegal.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
yes
sir.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
that's
right.
mr.
william
b.
bryant
thank
you,
your
honor.
it's
my
honor.
