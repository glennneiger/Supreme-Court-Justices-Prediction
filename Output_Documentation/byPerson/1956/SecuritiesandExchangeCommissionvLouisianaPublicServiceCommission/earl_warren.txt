in
the
offer

did
they
--
did
they
offer
to
introduce
new
testimony,
new
evidence?

you
may.
mr.

chief

where
do
we
find
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
--
i
thought
the
counsel
said
that
this
--
this
proceeding
had
been
going
on
in
some
form
or
others
since
1942?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
were
there
any
proceedings
before
1953
that
would
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
would
have
put
the
commission
on
--
your
commission
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
on
notice
that
--
that
they
were
investigating
this
company?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
finish
your
sentence.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr
--
mr.
ainsworth,
on
the
question
of
finality
of
the
s.
e.
c.
order.
how
long
after
the
time
for
appeal
has
expired,
would
you
say
that
your
commission
in
these
circumstances
would
have
the
right
to
--
to
have
the
case
reopened?
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
is
19
months
after
the
time
for
appeal
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
has
expired
as
i
recall.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
lead
you
to
the
conclusion
that
there
is
no
finality
to
this
order
of
the
s.
e.
c.?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
does
the
--
does
the
section
that
you
rely
on
say
that
you
may
petition?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
a
modification?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
(voice
overlap)
the
language
as
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
now,
do
you
find
definite
authority
in
that
section
for
saying
that
anybody
who
has
an
interest
in
the
matter
may
--
may
apply
to
the
commission
for
an
order
to
revoke
or
modify
its
original
order
regardless
of
the
time
that
--
for
appeal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
--
in
all
events
it's
your
answer
but
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that
you
put
a
burden
on
the
s.
e.
c.
because
they
were
responsive
enough
to
your
telegram
to
say,
well,
on
what
grounds
do
you
--
do
you
believe
that
this
order
should
--
should
be
modified?
it
seems
to
me
that
that
--
that
that
isn't
the
same
as
--
as
the
commission
initiating
a
request
to
your
commission
to
go
out
and
investigate
this
thing
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
ask
them
to
do
something
about
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
think
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
about
all
we
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
that,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
--
oh,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
ainsworth,
is
it
subject
also
to
--
might
it
be
subject
to
the
interpretation
that
congress
says,
“well
now,
even
after
making
an
order
which
has
become
final,
the
commission
may,
in
its
discretion
by
order,
revoke
or
modify
that
order
but
if
it
does,
anyone
who
is
injured
by
that
action
on
its
part
shall
have
the
right
of
judicial
review.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
that
--
is
that
an
unreasonable
construction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ainsworth,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
which
would
indicate
why
the
utility
itself
did
not
take
an
appeal
or
was
not
the
moving
party
in
this
situation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
monroe?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
the
patient
--
why
didn't
the
patient
object
an
appeal
from
the
first
operation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
are
the
conditions
that
are
so
changed
now
as
to
make
you
think
that
these
findings
of
the
commission,
the
s.
e.
c.
commission
are
so
erroneous
that
this
court
should
take
judicial
notice
of
it
and
--
and
permit
the
reopening,
when
at
the
time
your
--
your
minds
were
charged
with
it
and
you
had
just
had
the
hearing,
you
were
of
the
opinion
that
they
--
they
were
so
close
to
being
right
that
you
didn't
think
you
had
any
chance
of
appeal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
seems
to
me
that
--
it
seems
to
me
that
makes
the
question
more
pertinent
even
and
as
i
stated
if
--
if
they
were
so
near
right
at
the
time
they
were
made
that
you
felt
that
there
was
no
chance
of
you
--
of
you
getting
a
review
of
the
case.
why
do
you
now
think
that
those
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
same
findings
based
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
upon
those
same
conditions
are
so
wrong
that
this
court
should
take
judicial
notice
of
it
and
upset
the
whole
procedure
and
--
and
go
into
it
again?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it's
--
it's
your
answer
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
meeker.
