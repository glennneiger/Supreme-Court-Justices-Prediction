your
claim
--
your
claim
is
wholly
derivative.
you
impress
whatever
claim
you
press
merely
if
the
louisiana
commission
has
standards.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
not
about
that
can
bring
you
in
if
you
can
come
in.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
have
to,
meaning
you
can't
if
you
were
here
alone
without
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
wouldn't
be
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
history
of
the
death
sentence,
mr.
meeker,
has
there
been
any
--
what
has
been
the
experience
as
to
revision
of
the
terms
of
the
sentence
before
it
actually
was
carried
out
into
execution
in
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
--
what
is
the
tale
in
the
sentences
as
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
--
what
does
it
--
what
does
it
amount
to?
what's
the
experience?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
summarizes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
--
on
its
own
sua
sponte
and
its
own
organizations?
justice
felix
frankfurter
generally?
well,
i
mean
at
any
--
at
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
always
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
always
by
the
potential
victims
or
the
prospective
victims?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
time
within
which
those
applications
were
made,
have
you
got
any
--
laid
eyes
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
or
at
easy
would
it
be
too
--
too
much
of
a
burden
on
the
commission
because
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this,
what
do
you
say
to
the
suggestion
that
the
passage
of
time
and
the
actual
experience
of
what
was
decreed
in
the
order
of
--
of
dissolution
or
the
extermination
of
chain,
the
actual
experience?
nothing
happened
except
but
that
which
was
abstractly
assumed
turned
out
not
to
be
so
as
a
matter
of
experience.
i'm
thinking
out
to
the
exact
words
running
through
my
head.
this
court
has
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
rates,
the
famous
(inaudible)
case
said,
“well,
we
sustained
it
on
what
we
know
now
to
get
experience
on
that
come
in
and
we'll
change
it.”
just
in
other
words,
experience
versus
forecast,
is
there
anything
like
that
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
think
it
was
--
made
from
some
specific
--
gave
us
some
specific
data.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
before
the
qualification,
was
there
change
of
condition
in
the
sense
that
now
was
established
that
which
previously
had
to
be
nearly
speculated
or
guessed
at
or
an
expert
judgment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
if
they
--
what
if
in
a
well-known
phrase
of
an
earlier
opinion
in
this
court,
it's
an
appeal
from
judgment
by
speculation
to
judgment
by
experience,
anything
like
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
if
they
should?
they
are
two
different
from
my
point
of
view.
they
are
two
totally
different
parties.
the
commission
is
one
thing
and
the
--
and
the
utility
is
another
as
the
counsel
for
the
--
the
committee
for
the
utility
indicated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
couldn't
be
here
except
on
the
tail
--
he
is
a
tail
to
the
commission's
kite,
if
there
is
a
kite.
justice
felix
frankfurter
rather
an
unfortunate
phrase
in
connection
with
utility
matters.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
suggesting
they
foreclose.
all
i'm
saying
they,
in
my
mind
has
to
be
differentiated
and
i
can
well
conceive
that
the
commission
have
a
standing
that
the
utility
wouldn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
your
point
of
view
it
wouldn't
matter
if
it
--
if
there
were
change
of
conditions,
well
you
think
the
time
is
for
--
time
therefore
close,
they
shouldn't
have
come
in.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
other
way
around
--
the
other
way
around.
if
it
isn't
too
late
then
one
--
one
has
one
attitude
until
the
finding
changes
position.
if
therefore
closed
by
time,
i
don't
care
about
changes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
initiative.
