mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
here
today,
if
the
court
please,
as
special
counsel
for
the
louisiana
public
service
commission.
and
i
would
like
to
sketch
briefly
what
that
commission
is
before
i
get
into
the
basic
question
of
what
type
of
allegations
did
we
make
in
order
to
seek
a
revocation
or
modification
of
an
s.e.c.
order
in
a
petition
to
the
commission.
first
of
all,
the
louisiana
commission
is
the
official
public
utility
regulatory
body
of
that
state.
it
is
set
up
in
the
constitution
of
that
state.
it
has
all
necessary
power
and
authority
to
regulate
public
utilities.
it
is
composed
of
three
elected
members
who
are
elected
from
geographical
districts
of
the
state
of
louisiana.
one
of
the
commissioners
resides
in
the
northern
portion
of
the
state
in
monroe,
louisiana,
another
in
central
portion
in
baton
rouge,
the
other
in
new
orleans.
they
are
elected
for
six-year
overlapping
terms
and
they
have
the
duty
of
fixing
fair
rates
of
returns
for
public
utilities
and
establishing
the
rates
that
are
to
be
paid
by
consumers
and
that
is
by
the
public.
the
louisiana
commission's
obligation
and
duty
is
therefore
parallel
with
that
of
the
s.e.c.
it's
an
obligation
to
the
public
and
a
particular
one
that
the
consumers
in
this
case
of
the
services
of
louisiana
power.
the
s.e.c.
in
interpreting
the
public
utility
holding
company
act
feels
that
the
divestiture
of
the
gas
properties
of
louisiana
power
would
be
proper
under
these
circumstances.
the
louisiana
commission
feels
that
it
would
not
because
it
offered
to
prove
in
its
offer
of
proof
that
there
would
be
a
loss
of
substantial
economies,
to
wit
nearly
a
million
dollars
a
year
which
would
have
to
be
paid
if
these
two
systems
were
separated.
now
--
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
mr.
justice
douglas,
the
reason
stated
in
the
brief,
it
did
not
--
the
louisiana
public
service
commission
did
not
take
part
in
the
hearing,
not
having
at
that
time
made
a
study
of
the
effects
of
a
disposition
by
louisiana
such
as
were
subsequently
ordered
by
s.e.c.
that's
--
you'll
find
that
in
the
record
at
page
50.
the
record
at
page
54,
you
will
also
find
a
statement
that
the
commission
at
that
time
had
not
given
full
consideration
to
the
effect
of
such
a
disposition
and
indeed
had
not
anticipated
that
the
s.e.c.
would
order
such
disposition.
and
there
is
also
in
the
oral
argument
which
occurred
in
1955
before
the
s.e.c.,
a
statement
to
the
effect
of
a
clerical
mishap,
in
getting
the
notice
in
the
office,
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
commission.
in
any
event,
the
commission
did
not
take
part
but
it
later
filed
its
telegram,
its
petition
and
its
supplemental
petition.and
while
it
is
true,
as
counsel
points
out
that
the
fifth
circuit
through
a
unanimous
decision,
written
by
judge
tuttle,
who
was
accompanied
on
the
bench
at
that
time
by
judge
rives
and
judge
jones,
said
that
you
might,
in
a
petition
for
revocation,
examine
into
the
conditions
which
existed
at
the
time
the
earlier
order
was
issued.
it
is
not
correct
to
say
as
counsel
has
said
a
few
moments
ago
that
the
louisiana
commission
made
no
allegation
of
change
in
conditions.
i
would
like
to
read
the
supplemental
petition,
a
paragraph
from
it
by
way
of
illustrating
this.
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
on
the
record,
page
92
and
93.
subparagraph
numbered
3
of
the
supplemental
petition
states
that
since
the
final
hearings
had
in
file
numbers
--
numbering
them
and
the
subsequent
issue
of
order
herein
there
have
occurred
substantial
and
important
changes
in
the
conditions
and
facts
upon
which
the
findings,
an
order
of
his
honorable
commission,
were
predicated
in
said
proceedings
of
such
a
character
as
in
petitioner's
opinion
would
have
lead
this
honorable
commission
to
reach
a
different
and
contrary
conclusion
in
these
proceedings
with
regard
to
the
divestiture
by
louisiana
power
&
light
company
of
its
gas
properties.
now,
that
is
a
strong
allegation
i
suppose
as
the
louisiana
commission
could
make
that
there
were
--
that
there
was
a
change
in
conditions.
i
would
like
in
a
few
moments
to
examine
the
offer
of
proof
to
show
you
in
what
detail
the
louisiana
commission
submitted
those
conditions
and
facts
for
the
consideration
of
the
s.e.c.
and
which
were
fully
discussed
and
considered
at
the
five-hour
argument
which
occurred
before
that
commission
here
in
washington
in
july
1955.
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
well
--
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
was
not
counsel
at
that
time
and
i
can
only
take
what
i
find
in
the
briefs
and
the
statement
which
i
personally
made
at
the
oral
argument
in
july
1955.
the
only
reason
that
it
is
stated
is
that
the
commission
did
--
not
having
at
that
time
made
a
study
of
the
effects.
now,
if
you
will
look
at
the
record,
you
will
find
that
a
hearing
notice
was
issued
by
the
s.e.c.
in
january
1953
for
a
hearing
to
occur
three
weeks
subsequent
to
that
date
in
february
and
the
hearing
was
held
on
february
19th
and
20th
of
1953,
three
weeks
subsequently.
and
one
month
later,
the
order
on
march
20th,
1953
was
issued
which
is
the
basic
order,
which
is
--
which
has
been
assailed
in
this
particular
proceeding.
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
december
of
--
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
well,
it
--
maybe
again,
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
--
i
take
the
pleadings
as
i
find
them.
i
didn't
write
them
and
i'm
not
trying
to
find
fault
with
them.
i
--
i
think
this
supplemental
petition
filed
at
a
time
long
before
the
commission
heard
the
argument,
put
our
position
unequivocal
on
the
record.
there
could
be
no
doubt
where
we
stood
then.if
our
december
petition
didn't
say
enough,
it
--
it
was
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
we
filed
a
supplemental
petition
and
they
must
have
felt
that
made
some
support
or
some
bolstering.
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
no,
sir.
no
appearance
whatsoever.
and
--
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
yes,
i
am
not
familiar
with
that
but
they
were
a
part
of
the
original
electric
bond
and
share
system
which
is
reduced
down
finally
to
a
small
system
of
four
companies
in
the
middle
south
system
which
owns
the
louisiana
power
system
now.
that
louisiana
power
&
light
company
operates
wholly
within
the
state
of
louisiana.
its
properties
are
physically
situated
entirely
in
--
in
our
state.
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
well,
i
think
he's
--
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
--
probably
taking
the
original
electric
bond
share
proceeding
which
we
had
no
concern
whatever.
i'm
sure
that
the
--
maybe
starting
it
with
that
date.
actually,
the
s.e.c.
began
to
function
as
soon
as
the
public
utility
holding
company
act
was
passed
and
i
assume
that
electric
bond
and
share
which
is
one
of
the
large
public
utility
holding
company
systems
was
reached
rather
quickly.
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
what's
--
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
on
the
--
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
no,
sir,
none
whatever.
the
hearing
notice
of
january
1953
convening
a
hearing
three
weeks
hence
which
was
held
in
february
19th
and
the
20th,
two
days,
that's
not
such
a
protracted
hearing,
i
don't
believe
or
--
or
a
lengthily
hearing,
two-day
hearing
and
an
order
was
issued
a
month
later,
march
the
20th,
1953.
now,
in
june
1953,
the
louisiana
commission
passed
a
general
order
to
the
effect
that
no
public
utility
under
its
jurisdiction
might
sell
or
divest
itself
of
any
of
its
utility
assets
without
having
an
order
from
the
louisiana
public
service
commission.
in
1954,
when
the
louisiana
power
filed
its
application-declaration
jointly
with
louisiana
gas,
a
new
company
set
up
for
the
purpose
of
taking
over
the
gas
system,
it
likewise
filed
a
petition
with
the
louisiana
commission
in
november
1954.
and
it
was
in
december
1954
that
the
louisiana
commission
telegraphed
the
s.e.c.,
filed
its
original
petition
and
in
january
of
1955
when
it
filed
its
supplemental
petition.
that
pretty
well
records
the
chronology.
now,
if
the
court
please,
going
back
for
a
moment
to
what
i
said
about
the
louisiana
commission's
obligation
being
one
with
the
public
in
the
same
sense
as
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
you
will
find
a
recognition
of
the
position
of
a
state
commission
all
through
this
act,
i
shouldn't
say
all
through
but
in
numerous
places
in
the
act.
for
example
in
section
8,
whenever
a
state
law
requires
approval
of
the
ownership
by
a
single
company
of
utility
assets
of
both
in
electric
and
gas
system,
the
s.e.c.
won't
give
you
an
order
permitting
that
acquisition
without
first
having
approval
from
the
state
regulatory
commission
itself.
section
9
of
the
act
prohibits
a
registered
holding
company
without
s.e.c.
approval
from
acquiring
securities
or
utility
assets.
but
removes
that
prohibition
if
you
have
the
approval
of
the
state
commission
in
the
state
in
which
those
assets
are
situated.
section
21
of
the
public
utility
holding
company
act
states
that
nothing
in
that
whole
title
shall
affect
the
jurisdiction
of
any
other
commission
or
agency
or
officer
of
the
united
states
or
of
a
state
over
any
person,
and
person
as
defined
include
a
corporation
also,
unless
of
course
there
is
a
conflict
between
the
exercise
of
the
state
jurisdiction
and
the
objectives
of
the
public
utility
holding
company
act.
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
well,
i
assume
that
is
true
and
i
also
assume
that
it's
because
the
s.e.c.
recognized
the
interest
of
this
commission
that
they
invited
us
after
we
wired
them
in
december
1954
and
petitioned
them
in
december
1954,
invited
us
to
submit
an
offer
of
proof.
we
--
we
took
them
at
their
word
and
submitted
an
offer
of
proof,
it
took
our
staff
four
months
to
put
together.
and
you'll
find
that
offer
of
proof
in
the
record
beginning
on
page
16
and
numerous
pages
thereafter.
it's
an
involved
detailed
study
of
the
accounts,
both
at
the
home
office
level
and
division
level
and
the
local
level
of
louisiana
power.
the
purpose
of
the
study
was
to
set
up
or
project
two
corporations,
an
electric
and
a
gas
corporation
and
see
how
much
more
it
would
cost
to
operate
two
corporations
where
you
are
now
operating
one
corporation.
i
would
like
to
--
i
see
the
time
is
about
ready
for
adjournment.
and
if
your
honors
please,
i
would
like
tomorrow
to
develop
the
offer
of
proof
in
greater
detail
to
let
your
honors
see
what
the
circumstances
were
under
which
we
came
to
the
s.e.c.
that
the
s.e.c.
invited
our
participation
at
least
to
the
extent
of
an
offer
of
proof
that
we
submitted
this
offer
of
proof
and
then
our
right
to
take
this
matter
to
court
and
ask
for
a
judicial
review
is
expressly
provided
in
the
statute
itself,
expressly
provided
in
section
11
(b)
of
the
entire
33
sections
of
the
public
utility
holding
company
act.
it
is
only
in
section
11
(b)
that
the
right
of
judicial
review
is
expressly
repeated.
as
counsel
said,
"it
need
not
have
been
placed
in
the
act
because
under
section
24
(a)
you
may
appeal
any
order.
any
person
aggrieved
by
an
order
of
the
s.e.c.
may
appeal
to
a
u.s.
court
of
appeals."
but
here
by
way
of
recognition
that
congress
intended
that
the
right
of
judicial
review
should
not
be
taken
away
on
a
petition
to
revoke
or
modify
an
order
earlier
made
where
the
allegations
or
that
the
conditions
upon
which
the
order
was
predicated
did
not
exist
specifically
again
repeated.
so
that
to
me,
it
leaves
no
doubt
that
we
have
the
right
of
judicial
review
and
the
lower
court
and
judge
tuttle
so
held
that
--
i
see
my
time
is
up
--
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
and
so
that
judge
tuttle
in
writing
this
opinion
held
that
the
right
of
judicial
review
was
available,
that
the
s.e.c.
had
treated
the
petition
of
the
louisiana
commission
as
a
petition
to
revoke
or
modify,
that
it
fell
squarely
under
the
provisions
of
the
statute.
and
it
was
for
that
reason
that
we
had
a
right
of
judicial
review.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
--
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
on
yesterday,
may
it
please
the
court,
we
considered
and
sketched
briefly
the
louisiana
public
service
commission,
its
powers,
its
duties
and
its
obligations
and
compared
them
on
parallel
courses
as
far
as
practical
with
the
functions
of
the
s.
e.
c.
we
also
discussed
the
right
of
judicial
review
of
any
order
made
under
subsection
11
of
the
public
utility
holding
company
act.
today,
i
should
like
to
discuss
the
merits
of
the
case
with
particular
reference
to
the
louisiana
public
service
commission,
applying
the
principles
of
section
11,
subsection
1
(a),
(b)
and
(c)
of
the
act
because
we
feel
that
the
objectives,
the
obligations
and
duties
of
that
commission
do
not
conflict
with
those
of
the
s.
e.
c.
that
their
orbits
of
influence
need
not
necessarily
clash,
that
the
congress
when
it
enacted
the
public
utility
holding
company
act
and
particularly
when
it
inserted
the
proviso
which
i
shall
read
in
a
moment
in
section
11
(b)
(1),
that
it
intended
to
take
care
of
a
situation
exactly
such
as
we
described
on
the
merits
of
this
case.
and
so
it
is
our
feeling
that
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
provisions
of
the
act
would
bring
the
same
conclusion
here,
we
hope,
that
the
fifth
circuit
thought
was
justified
under
the
provisions
of
the
act.
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
or
at
the
time
of
the
commission's
original
order
and
subsequent
thereto.
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
i
--
i
do
but
i
don't
find
it
entirely
necessary
to
do
so.
yes,
i
do
--
i
made
the
point
to
the
fifth
circuit
and
they
agreed
with
the
point
which
we
raised,
but
i
find
that
there
has
been
and
we
have
alleged
a
change
of
circumstances.
you
can
take
it
on
either
premise
if
you
will.
if
you
feel
that
the
circumstances
at
the
time
based
on
the
erroneous
legal
interpretations
as
such
that
the
s.
e.
c.
has
committed
error,
you
could
find
on
that
basis
or
if
you
felt
that
the
facts
and
circumstances
which
have
occurred
subsequent
to
the
earlier
order
was
such
that
it
required
a
reversal.
you
could
do
it
on
either
point.
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
well,
that's
--
we
have
nothing
in
mind
except
to
remand
on
any
set
of
circumstances.
we
don't
ask
this
court
to
decide
the
case.
the
fifth
circuit
remanded
the
case
to
the
s.
e.
c.
and
directed
the
s.
e.
c.
to
try
it
on
the
basis
of
the
legal
interpretations
which
it
had
given.
so
we
--
one
of
the
points
i
intend
to
raise
here
today,
the
louisiana
commission
seeks
to
cooperate
with
the
s.
e.
c.,
the
louisiana
commission
seeks
to
work
with
the
s.
e.
c.
on
this
particular
proposition.
it
feels
it
has
some
peculiar
knowledge
and
information
about
this
particular
utility
that
gives
it
a
better
opportunity
to
regulate
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
s.
e.
c.
can't
regulate
it
beyond
whether
or
not
it
fits
into
a
--
a
holding
company
system.
the
louisiana
--
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
well,
if
your
--
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
the
act
doesn't
put
any
particular
limitation
you
--
as
i
see
it,
you
have
to
go
to
the
provisions
of
the
act
which
allow
you
the
petition
for
revocation
and
modification
that
you
are
able
to
state,
the
conditions
upon
which
the
order
was
predicated
do
not
exist.
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
now,
--
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
no
--
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
11
(b)
orders
must
be
carried
out
within
one
year
after
they
are
--
are
issued
by
the
s.
e.
c.,
unless
the
s.
e.
c.
extends
them
and
then
they
may
only
extend
them
for
one
year
and
we
don't
have
a
proposition
where
for
an
indefinite
period
the
--
the
utility
is
allowed
to
fail
to
comply,
it
must
comply
within
that
particular
time
limit.
now,
we
have
petitioned
for
revocation
or
modification
using
the
words
of
the
statute
and
we
think
allegations
which
--
which
fit
within
the
statute
and
ask
for
a
revocation
or
modification
before
the
11
(b)
order
has
actually
gone
into
effect.
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
well,
may
i
--
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
may
i
read
it,
sir?
it's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
the
section
follows
--
it's
the
section
11
(b)
(1)
--
it's
section
11
(b)
as
it
is
indented
in
the
--
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
--
copy
of
the
act
which
i
have.
it's
actually
the
last
two
sentences
of
section
11
(b),
"the
commission
may
by
order
revoke
or
modify
any
order
previously
made
under
this
subsection,
if,
after
notice
and
opportunity
for
hearing,
it
finds
that
the
conditions
upon
which
the
order
was
predicated
do
not
exist."
followed
immediately
behind
that
is
the
sentence,
"any
order
made
under
this
subsection
shall
be
subject
to
--
to
judicial
review
as
provided
in
section
24."
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
won't
say
anybody
because
i
am
not
--
i
don't
know
whether
it
be
proper
to
say
so.
i
will
say
that
a
state
commission
under
the
peculiar
circumstances
here,
where
we
were
asked
to
submit
an
offer
of
proof,
where
we
submitted
an
elaborate
offer
of
proof
which
we
think
would
prove
the
situation,
where
we
allege
that
the
--
that
there
are
erroneous
legal
interpretations
which
supported
the
commission's
later
order,
that
under
the
circumstances
here
you
must
determine
whether
you
think
there
has
been
an
abuse
of
the
commission's
discretion.
so
i
say
that
i
would
rather
pitch
my
case
on
the
facts
of
my
case
rather
than
to
make
the
broad
generality
that
any
person
that
come
in.
i
can
only
apply
it
to
louisiana
commission,
the
state
regulatory
commission
which
has
come
in
under
the
peculiar
circumstances
here
and
submitted
all
of
its
information,
had
a
very
lengthy
argument
before
the
s.
e.
c.
in
consideration
of
those
premises.
and
based
again
on
what
the
fifth
circuit
held
to
be
and
which
we
think
in
reason
and
in
logic
would
support
the
view
that
they
were
erroneous
legal
interpretations,
it
remanded
it
for
consideration
consistent
with
those
legal
interpretations.
i
don't
know
whether
i
answered
your
question
or
not,
sir,
but
that's
--
that's
the
best
(inaudible)
that
i
can
deal
with
it.
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
well,
i
admit
that.
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
well,
i
must
concede
that
your
honor
is
right
about
that.
the
s.
e.
c.
did
not
initiate
this
petition,
we
did
initiate
it.
the
s.
e.
c.
gave
sufficient
deference
to
the
louisiana
commission
and
to
say,
what
is
the
basis
upon
which
you
would
care
to
come
in
here
--
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
i
did
--
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
--
did
so.
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
no,
i
don't
attempt
to
say
that
the
s.
e.
c.
initiated
the
investigation
because
i
assume
that
they
were
content
with
their
order,
they
still
are
with
there
march
20th,
1953
order.
but
i
say
that
you
must
examine
the
facts
of
this
case
and
see
whether
or
not
you
think
there
has
been
an
abuse
of
discretion
particularly
where
we
hold
with
the
fifth
circuit
that
the
conclusions
were
based
on
--
on
erroneous
legal
interpretations.
and
if
you
would
apply
those
erroneous
legal
interpretations,
we
say
you
couldn't
make
out
a
case
under
the
provisions
of
this
act
because
the
commission
has
so
narrowly
construed
the
clause
(a)
provisions
of
the
subsection
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
do
so.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
develop
briefly
the
offer
of
proof.before
doing
so
may
i
point
out
that
the
proviso
which
i
promised
i
would
read
that
and
i
haven't
done
so
and
i
would
like
just
to
sketch
the
proviso
for
a
moment.
section
--
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
that's
in
the
pamphlet,
part
of
the
act
which
the
s.
e.
c.
gave
you
in
the
blue
bound
copy.
it's
the
first
document,
i
believe.
yes,
mr.
meeker
points
out
that
it
is
and
the
first
--
it's
the
first
--
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
--
pamphlet
here.
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
it's
on
page
20
of
that
pamphlet.
section
11
(b),
i
will
paraphrase
or
not
repeat
all
of
the
words
of
the
first
subsection
1,
but
when
i
get
the
proviso,
i'll
read
every
word
that
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
the
commission
to
require
by
order
that
each
registered
holding
company
shall
take
such
action
as
the
commission
shall
find
necessary
to
limit
its
operations
to
a
single
integrated
public
utility
system."
now,
provided
--
i
have
skipped
several
words
there,
but
i
don't
think
they're
pertinent
particularly,
provided,
however,
that
the
commission
shall
permit
a
registered
holding
company
to
continue
to
control
one
or
more
additional
integrated
public
utility
systems
if
after
notice
and
opportunity
to
--
for
a
hearing
it
finds
that
(a),
each
of
such
additional
systems
cannot
be
operated
as
an
independent
system
without
the
loss
of
substantial
economies
which
can
be
secured
by
the
retention
of
control
by
such
holding
company
of
such
system.
and
then
the
(b)
and
(c)
provisions,
i
don't
believe
are
--
are
at
issue
here
but
they
are
interesting
to
see
whether
or
not
we
are
--
we
fit
with
them
and
(b)
states
that
all
of
such
additional
systems
are
located
in
one
state
or
in
an
adjoining
states
or
in
a
contiguous
foreign
country.
the
louisiana
power
system
is
entirely
located
within
the
state
of
louisiana.
the
(c)
provision
states
that
the
contingent
combination
of
such
systems
under
the
control
of
the
holding
company,
i
skipped
a
few
words,
is
not
so
large
as
to
impair
the
advantages
of
localized
management,
efficient
operation
or
the
effectiveness
of
regulation.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
proviso
in
the
act
somewhat
softened
the
impact
of
the
directive
to
the
s.
e.
c.
which
congress
had
passed
in
this
particular
act
and
there
was
a
reason
for
that,
there
had
been
a
disagreement.
the
legislative
history
shows
there
had
been
a
disagreement
between
the
senate
and
the
house
as
to
what
the
provisions
of
the
act
should
be.
the
senate
passed
a
version.
the
house
passed
a
version
with
amendments.
the
amendments
were
not
concurred
in
by
the
senate
and
it
was
necessary
that
the
matter
go
to
conference.
and
after
the
conference,
there
was
an
attempt
made
in
the
house
to
adopt
the
conference
report
which
in
effect
would
adopt
the
senate
bill
which
did
not
have
this
proviso.
that
--
the
house
rejected
the
agreement
to
--
to
the
conference
report
and
another
conference
report
was
prepared
which
contains
the
provisions
which
are
now
in
the
act
and
which
we
are
adopted.
now,
the
conference
report
of
the
house,
which
i
find
on
page
20
of
the
louisiana
power's
brief
and
i
will
borrow
that
paragraph
from
their
brief
makes
this
significant
statement,
"the
conference
substitute
meets
the
house's
desire
to
provide
for
a
further
flexibility
by
the
statement
of
additional
definite
and
concrete
circumstances
under
which
exception
should
be
made
to
the
form
of
one
integrated
system."
i
ask
your
honors
to
note
the
word
“flexibility”
and
that
was
what
the
proviso
was
designed
to
do
and
that's
what
we
think
it
did
do.
“definite
exceptions
not
only
provide
a
satisfactory
constitutional
standard
but
also
an
effective
standard
for
the
guidance
of
both
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
and
those
holding
companies
which
wished
voluntary
--
voluntarily
to
comply
with
congressional
policy.”
it's
the
end
of
the
quotation.
so
we
--
we
think
that
the
proviso
as
a
matter
of
fact
one
of
the
circuit
judges
said,
i
think,
perhaps
on
a
dissenting
opinion
that
the
act
would
not
have
passed
had
the
proviso
not
been
inserted
in
it.
and
i
think
we
may
imply
that
from
the
legislative
history
because
of
the
failure
of
the
first
conference
report,
they
have
been
concurred
in
by
the
house
of
representatives.
so
i
think
we
may
fairly
say
that
this
public
utility
holding
company
act
would
not
have
passed
had
this
proviso
not
been
inserted
in
it.
now,
in
--
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
it's
susceptible
to
that
construction
and
i
think
it
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
it's
unreasonable
but
i
again
say
that
i'm
not
seeking
that
interpretation
here.
i
ask
only
--
and
i'm
not
trying
to
be
illogical
about
it,
i
ask
only
that
--
that
this
court
hold
under
these
particular
facts
and
circumstances
and
this
particular
state
commission
coming
here
whether
it
is
entitled
any
greater
consideration
or
not
is
something
that
i
am
not
prepared
to
say.
but
i
have
in
sketching
the
background
of
the
act
upon
yesterday,
attempted
to
show
your
honors
that
congress
in
passing
the
act
felt
that
--
that
the
word
of
the
state
commission
under
certain
circumstances
was
very
vital.
in
fact,
they
wouldn't
give
approval
of
certain
types
of
transactions
without
state
commission
approval.
now,
that
is
purely
an
analogy,
i
agree
and
i'm
just
trying
to
--
to
bring
it
by
analogy
but
for
any
person,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
wouldn't
--
i
say
it's
susceptible
to
that
construction
but
i
don't
ask
for
it
here,
i
ask
only
that
you
hold
that
this
commission
can
come
in
and
do
so.
now,
the
offer
of
proof
which
the
louisiana
commission
filed
stated
that
it
had
exercised
jurisdiction
over
the
retail
electric
and
gas
rates
of
this
company
of
--
for
residential,
commercial
and
so
forth
uses
that
the
commission
requires
louisiana
power
to
file
annual
reports
that
it
had
fixed
the
electric
rate
base
of
louisiana
power
back
in
1946,
had
prescribed
its
allowable
rate
of
return,
that
its
electric
--
at
louisiana
power's
electric
accounts
are
classified
on
the
uniform
systems
of
accounts
as
or
the
gas
accounts.
and
then
in
the
offer
of
proof,
louisiana
commission
used
the
language
of
the
(a),
(b),
(c)
provisions
of
the
proviso
which
i
have
just
read
and
alleged
that
the
facts
would
say
--
would
show
in
the
offer
of
proof,
fitted
into
those
particular
provisions.
and
it
said
that
there
is
no
law
of
the
state
of
louisiana
which
prohibits
the
ownership
by
utility
of
both
an
electric
and
gas
system.
that
louisiana
power
has
the
express
approval
of
the
louisiana
commission
to
have
both
an
electric
and
gas
system.
that
the
public
interest
would
best
be
served
by
the
continued
operation
of
louisiana
power
of
both
in
electric
and
gas
system
and
it
supported
that
by
a
letter
from
the
governor
of
the
state
and
by
letters
from
the
officials
of
28
of
the
30
towns
and
cities
which
this
company
serves
and
14
of
the
15
parishes
or
counties
which
are
involved
in
this
particular
system,
which
are
covered
and
embraced
in
this
particular
system.
it
further
supported
its
offer
of
proof
by
a
separation
study,
a
detail
separation
study
which
you
will
find
in
the
record
at
pages
--
beginning
at
page
16.
and
it
showed
that
the
total
additional
cost
to
consumers
and
customers
of
louisiana
power
would
be
$957,000
a
year
of
which
$684,000
would
be
lost
to
the
electric
system
and
$272,000
would
be
lost
to
the
gas
system.
the
separation
study
was
--
was
made
by
taking
the
operations
of
this
company
for
1954
and
extracting
from
the
electric
system
of
accounts
all
charges
that
had
heretofore
the
--
extracting
from
the
books,
i'd
better
say.
those
charges
which
had
heretofore
been
made
for
the
gas
system
and
set
--
setting
up
and
projecting
two
separate
corporations
just
as
if
they
had
operated
separately
on
that
particular
year.
and
it
was
natural
that
there
should
be
and
the
--
the
loss
of
$957,000
came
from
the
fact
that
you
were
going
to
have
two
overhead
cost
where
you
had
one
before.
and
because
of
the
fact
that
this
particular
company's
gas,
customers
are
largely
also
its
electric
customers
there's
going
to
be
a
duplication
of
activity,
duplication
of
billing,
of
reading
the
meters,
of
--
duplication
of
administrative
officers
and
so
forth.
and
the
total
that's
shown
in
the
record
here,
the
exact
amount
is
actually
computed
by
the
louisiana
commission's
own
staff
and
it
comes
out
to
what
louisiana
commission
considered
a
very
large
sum
of
money
which
would
be
lost
to
customers
of
louisiana
power
by
divestiture
of
the
gas
system
in
a
separation
of
the
gas
system
from
the
electric
system.
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
--
and
i
--
i'm
not
prepared
to
say.
i
don't
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
on
that
subject.
now,
another
thing
that
was
brought
in
the
offer
of
proof
was
that
under
the
peculiar
facts
and
circumstances
and
based
somewhat
upon
the
climatic
conditions
of
the
state
of
louisiana
that
been
--
that
the
gas
and
electric
systems
tended
to
compliment
each
other,
that
in
the
summer
you
had
a
higher
use
of
electricity,
in
the
winter
you
had
a
higher
use
of
gas.
and
there's
an
exhibit
in
this
record
that
shows
that
by
combining
the
two
on
six
months
basis
beginning
in
november
through
april
and
from
may
through
october
that
they
balanced
out
the
total
revenues
from
the
two
systems,
averaged
out
about
50%
each
time.
so
that
the
company,
by
virtue
of
having
the
two
systems,
tended
to
have
a
complete
operation
from
the
very
nature
of
things
inherent
in
the
operation
of
the
company.
louisiana
commission
said
that
it
--
in
it's
offer
of
proof
that
it
had
--
had
long
experience
with
this
utility,
that
it
believed
it
to
be
an
efficient
operation,
that
it
had
found
its
regulation
in
louisiana
power
to
be
most
effective
that
that
company
had
never
had
been
given
a
rate
increase.
on
the
other
hand,
it
had
given
electric
rate
reductions
that
the
only
gas
increase
that
had
ever
occurred
was
one
equal
to
the
amount
of
the
increase
in
the
wholesale
cost
of
gas
to
this
particular
company.
and
so,
on
the
basis
and
on
the
predicate
of
--
and
i
have
skimmed
through
it
only
very
briefly,
they
held
the
louisiana
commission
felt
that
the
facts
justified
a
holding
that
giving
a
reasonable
interpretation
to
the
section
11
(b)
(1),
particular
clause
(a),
that
the
loss
of
economies
was
a
substantial
one,
the
courts
have
held
that
substantial
means
important
economies.
that's
the
circuit
--
the
second
circuit
held
that,
the
fifth
circuit
held
it
in
our
own
case.
we
say
substantial
is
a
relative
and
an
elastic
term.
the
s.
e.
c.
interprets
substantial
to
mean
that
the
losses
must
be
so
great
that
the
severed
system,
here
the
gas
system,
could
not
continue
to
operate
independently,
economically.
now,
we
say
that
that
conclusion
is
simply
not
justified
by
the
language
of
the
statute
and
that
is
an
erroneous
interpretation
and
it
--
it
confines
this
proviso
so
tight
that
it
would
be
practically
impossible
to
fit
within
it.
in
other
words,
that
it
has
the
effect
of
nullifying
the
proviso.
we
also
say
that
the
loss
of
substantial
economies
should
relate
not
only
to
the
severed
system,
the
gas
system,
but
also
to
the
principal
system,
the
electric
system,
that
it
would
be
blinding
one's
eyes
to
reality
as
the
brief
of
the
louisiana
commission
says
when
it
--
which
was
submitted
to
the
s.
e.
c.
you
did
not
take
the
total
loss
into
consideration.
mr.
robert
a.
ainsworth,
jr.
well,
actually,
may
it
please
the
court,
there
are
a
number
of
things
shown
in
the
offer
of
proof
whether
you
consider
them
substantial
changes
in
circumstances.
that's
why
a
moment
ago
when
you
asked
me
the
question,
i
didn't
want
to
confine
it
only
to
that,
i
also
feel
that
we
have
to
go
back
to
the
conditions
that
existed
at
the
time
the
original
order
was
issued
which
were
based
upon
erroneous
legal
interpretations.
but
to
answer
your
question
more
directly,
the
order
was
issued
in
1953,
the
early
order,
the
separation
study
was
based
on
facts
and
circumstances
in
1954.
since
the
order
of
1953
had
been
issued,
it
had
been
possible
to
find
out
that
the
--
the
severed
or
gas
system
would
have
to
pay
a
larger
amount
for
a
debt
service
because
louisiana
power
had
actually
gone
into
the
market
and
sought
that
financing
for
the
company
that
was
to
be
set
up
to
take
over
the
gas
system.
that
in
addition
to
that
the
louisiana
commission
had
the
benefit
of
the
studies
of
the
operations
of
the
arkansas
power
&
light
company
and
the
mississippi
power
&
light
company
which
has
severed
their
gas
systems
to
show
what
the
increase
cost
had
been
to
those
companies
or
no
longer
being
able
to
allocate
part
of
their
overhead
expenses
to
gas
system.
and
the
--
the
running
of
time
was
necessary
in
order
to
have
that
information
before
the
commission,
it
could
not
have
been
obtained,
it
could
not
have
been
submitted
to
the
s.
e.
c.
at
the
time
because
those
systems
had
only
then
been
severed
and
it
--
the
information
wasn't
then
available.
so
we
put
it
on
two
premises
as
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
it
could
--
that
the
court
could
examine
the
conditions
that
truly
prevailed
at
the
time
the
original
order
was
made.
we
ask
your
honors
to
consider
these
legal
interpretations
which
the
s.
e.
c.
has
given,
which
we
respectfully
suggest
are
erroneous.
we
ask
you
also
to
examine
the
offer
of
proof
and
decide
whether
or
not
in
your
exercise
of
judicial
authority
and
discretion,
whether
or
not
the
facts
and
circumstances
which
were
shown
subsequent
to
the
time
of
the
march
20,
1953
order
justify
the
allegation
which
you
find
in
the
supplemental
petition.
that's
our
case,
we
stand
or
fall
on
it,
if
your
honors
please.
and
we
are
anxious
that
the
louisiana
commission
to
have
the
opportunity
of
cooperating
and
working
with
the
s.
e.
c.,
but
we
can
see
no
compensating
advantages
which
accrue
from
the
separation
of
this
gas
system
in
louisiana,
it's
contrary
to
the
state
policy
and
we
feel
that
if
haven't
--
if
--
if
given
the
opportunity
on
a
remand
to
go
back
to
the
s.
e.
c.,
we
would
hope
to
persuade
our
brothers
there.
thank
you.
