justice
john
m.
harlan
was
the
public
service
commission
a
party
to
that
proceeding?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
just
to
make
sure
i
understand.
your
view
of
this
kind
of
a
reopening
order
is
that
it
is
not
appealable
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
and
this
last
section
only
refers
to
the
basic
order,
the
last
sentence,
where
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
basic
orders,
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
where,
when
you
look
at
it,
is
a
proceeding
for
a
new
trial
based
on
newly
discovered
evidence?
does
that
make
any
difference
to
your
view?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
go
back
to
that
petition
--
supplemental
petition?
justice
john
m.
harlan
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
was
1955
and
your
original
petition
was
filed
in
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
december
of
1954.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
in
that
original
petition
as
i
read
it
hastily,
it
looks
as
if
you
were
laying
your
ground
for
reopening
simply
on
the
theory
that
you
wanted
a
reconsideration
of
the
matter
and
that
you
hadn't
appeared
in
that
proceeding
before
and
you'd
like
to
have
another
encore
on
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
that
to
get
change
in
circumstances,
it
relates
to
circumstances
justified
on
the
basis
of
circumstances
would
be
in
existence
prior
to
the
time
to
the
commission's
original
order?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
there
are
two
things
indifferent
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you
do
--
you
do
(inaudible)
i
take
it
to
support
the
fifth
circuit
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
there
might
be
a
different
position
(inaudible)
change
of
circumstances
with
subsequent
change
of
circumstances
that
such
an
order
was
appealable
and
after
i
would
suppose
it
might
be
doing
that,
was
it
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
aren't
all
of
those
arguments,
matters
which
had
you
appeared
in
the
original
proceedings
you
would
have
addressed
to
the
commission.
and
what
--
i
haven't
heard
anything
that
you
said
that
supports
this
allegation
in
your
supplemental
petition
where
you
allege
that
since
the
--
subsequent
to
the
issuance
of
the
order
herein
there
have
occurred
substantial
and
important
changes
in
the
condition
and
so
forth.
