mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
yes,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issues
in
this
case
are
principally
between
two
--
the
two
commissions,
the
louisiana
commission
and
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
my
client
file
--
finds
itself
very
much
in
the
position
of
a
patient
being
operated
on
by
two
doctors,
each
with
a
different
diagnosis.
so
i
would
like
to
say
a
few
words
from
the
way
point
of
view
of
the
patient.
first,
to
clear
up
a
question
that
was
raised
--
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
if
your
honor
please.
the
patient
appeared
at
the
original
hearing
in
1953
and
sincerely
believing
that
the
gas
and
electric
systems
could
not
be
operated
separately
without
the
loss
of
substantial
economies.
introduced
documentary
and
oral
testimony
which
purported
to
show
savings
of
approximately
$450,000,
i
mean
increased
cost
of
that
amount
in
the
electric
properties
in
the
separate
operation
and
about
$250,000
in
the
gas
properties.
the
s.
e.
c.
held
that
that
was
not
a
showing
of
a
sufficient
--
of
a
loss
of
substantial
economies
sufficient
to
make
the
conditions.
we
felt
at
--
at
that
time
at
--
on
the
basis
of
the
record
and
without
the
official
nonpartisan
findings
of
a
commission
or
with
that
or
--
and
also
there
not
having
been
a
complete
separation
study
made
that
our
chances
on
appeal
were
not
very
good.
and
that's
the
reason
we
did
not
appeal.
but
we
sincerely
believe
that
we
are
right
in
the
position
that
we
took
and
we
felt
perhaps
we
had
not
made
a
sufficiently
good
record.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
no,
we
did
not,
your
honor.
we
were
before
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
and
not
before
the
louisiana
commission.
now,
at
that
time
there
was
no
outstanding
order
which
the
louisiana
commission
later
entered.
in
june
the
16th,
1953,
the
louisiana
commission
entered
a
general
order
that
no
disposition
of
properties
could
be
made
by
any
utility
under
its
jurisdiction
without
its
permission
and
if
--
if
that
general
order
had
been
in
effect
we
probably
would've
sought
to
get
them
to
come
in
and
state
their
position
at
that
time
but
that
order
was
only
entered
later.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
yes,
we
did
--
we
did
endeavor
--
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
--
to
make
that
factual.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
oh,
yes.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
oh,
yes.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
that's
right.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
mr.
justice
whittaker,
that
is
a
--
an
argument
of
the
commission
--
of
the
louisiana
commission.
we
have
simply
confined
ourselves
to
an
argument
of
the
substantive
questions
here
but
because
we
--
we
failed
to
appeal,
however,
we
--
we
do
believe
that
until
the
act
that
the
order
of
the
commission
is
carried
out.
in
other
words,
until
the
--
the
death
sentence
is
executed
then
a
body
such
as
the
louisiana
commission,
which
is
primarily
concerned
with
the
regulation
of
the
rights
of
louisiana,
should
be
allowed
to
come
in
and
to
show,
one,
that
the
--
that
the
order
of
the
commission
was
based
on
erroneous
interpretations
of
law.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
yes.
that
it
was
wrong
--
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
that
it
--
that
the
--
the
interpretations
of
law
were
wrong
and
all
--
and
that
--
that
they
were
so
wrong
that
they
within
themselves
constitute
a
change
of
convictions.
and
i
say
to
your
honor
also
the
fact
that
--
that
the
public
service
commission
and
the
--
the
governing
bodies
of
all
the
--
of
all
but
one
of
the
parishes
in
which
we
operate
and
the
--
and
all
the
municipalities,
all
of
them
gave
expression
that
it
was
against
the
public
interest
to
sever
these
properties
is
a
new
fact
which
should
be
taken
into
consideration
when
entering
this
severance
order.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
that's
right.
we
--
we
are
--
we
are
really
here
just
arguing
the
substantive
question
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
that
is
right.
i've
been
brought
here.
[laughs]
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
well,
as
--
let
me
answer
you
in
two
stages.
first;
we
don't
think
that
you
are
limited
to
showing
a
change
of
conditions,
as
the
statue
says
you
simply
are
showing
that
the
conditions
upon
which
said
order
do
not
exist.
and
we
say
that
the
--
one
of
the
conditions
on
which
the
order
were
issued
were
erroneous
interpretations
of
a
meaning
of
--
of
proviso
(a)
--
section
11
(a)
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
well
--
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
well
--
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
all
right.
i'd
like
to
answer
that
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
at
the
time
in
1953,
in
examining
the
--
the
decisions
of
the
courts
of
appeal,
we
found
certain
dicta
from
--
in
at
least
two
cases
which
would
indicate
that
the
interpretations
of
the
s.
e.
c.
might
be
upheld.
they
were
the
engineers
public
service
case
and
the
philadelphia
case.
since
that
time,
you
have
another
decision
directly
in
point
by
the
fifth
circuit
court
below
and
so
--
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
in
this
case
it,
directly
on
these
points
and
so
i
say
there
is
a
different
situation
here.
when
we
were
considering
appeal,
we
were
considering
the
state
of
the
law
and
then
--
and
we
were
also
considering
state
of
our
record.
now,
you
asked
about
the
changed
conditions,
as
i
said,
i
think
the
fact
that
an
examination
into
whether
the
public
interest
would
be
served
by
this
and
--
and
that's
one
of
the
standards
by
which
the
act
should
be
interpreted.
that
has
been
more
or
less
determined
by
a
--
a
careful
examination
of
it
by
the
louisiana
public
service
and
the
impartial
body
and
also
by
expressions
from
the
--
from
the
governing
authorities
of
the
parishes
and
cities
where
this
gas
system
operates
and
--
does
that
answer
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
[laughter]
well,
as
i
said,
our
point
of
view
is
one
that
we
--
we
do
not
have
to
show
changed
conditions,
that
number
two
that
there
are
--
there
are
changes.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
no,
no
--
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
i
should
not
be
making
this
argument
--
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
--
mr.
--
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
--
to
the
chief
justice.
i
didn't
intend
to
bring
it.
[laughs]
but
getting
back
to
--
to
louisiana,
i
want
to
point
out
that
louisiana
power
&
light
company
is
an
operating
company
and
it's
always
been
an
operating
company
and
it
operates
both
the
gas
and
electric
systems
entirely
within
the
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
justice
douglas
asked
whether
it
was
registered,
yesterday.
it's
not
registered
because
it
is
not
a
holding
company
but
it
is
a
subsidiary
of
a
registered
holding
company
and
as
such
is
subject
to
the
act.
now,
and
i
want
to
point
out
too
that
it
--
there
is
no
problem
here
involved
of
the
use
of
a
holding
company
device
to
permit
the
joint
operation
of
gas
and
electric
properties
where
it's
against
the
policy
of
the
state.
now,
that
was
one
of
the
considerations
in
writing
the
holding
company
act.
here,
always
that
louisiana
power
&
light
has
operated
both
gas
and
electric
properties
so
there's
no
--
and
in
louisiana,
the
other
comparable
electric
companies
who
were
not
subject
to
the
holding
company
act
also
operate
gas
and
the
commission
has
had
experience
with
this
joint
operation.
now,
we
submit,
if
your
honor
please,
that
on
the
state
of
the
record
in
this
case,
it
must
be
assumed
that
if
this
separation
is
or
complied
with
that
there
will
be
a
loss
of
$957,000,
a
minimum
of
that
--
a
year.
that
there
will
be
a
additional
cost
to
a
separated
gas
properties
in
the
form
of
a
higher
interest
rate,
it
was
estimated
by
the
commission
at
approximately
$28,000
a
year.
also
there
will
be
loss,
the
other
advantages
of
combined
operation.
it
must
also
be
assumed
that
there
are
no
compensating
advantages
of
any
sort
in
the
natural
course
of
events,
this
additional
cost
of
operation
is
bound
to
be
born
by
the
--
the
rate
payers
of
louisiana's
gas
customers
and
electric
customers.
now,
this
seems
to
be
admittedly
a
highly
undesirable
result
and
therefore
in
approaching
the
interpretation
of
section
11
(b)
(1)
(a),
we
ask
ourselves
does
that
--
do
those
words
require
this
result?
now,
those
words
which
have
been
quoted
by
--
by
counsel
for
the
commission
are
these.
the
--
in
order
to
retain
the
system
this
is
the
first
requirement,
each
such
additional
system
cannot
be
operated
as
an
independent
system
without
the
loss
of
substantial
economies
which
can
be
secured
by
the
retention
of
control
by
such
holding
company
of
such
system.
now,
the
s.
e.
c.
says
that
requires
this
result
because
you
can
only
take
into
account
the
cost
to
the
gas
system.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
yes,
to
the
system
that
you
--
you're
severing,
can't
take
into
the
question
of
fact
that
there's
a
great
loss
of
economy
to
the
--
the
remaining
system,
the
electric
system.
i
don't
see
that
anywhere
in
this
--
in
the
language
because
the
language
says
the
loss
of
substantial
economies
which
can
be
secured
by
retention.
now,
it
also
--
s.
e.
c.
also
says,
the
loss
to
this
system
to
be
severed
must
be
so
great
that
the
severed
system
is
incapable
of
economic
operation.
well,
that
--
that
is
nowhere
in
the
statute
and
that
is
reading
the
exception
into
--
reading
it
practically
out
of
the
statute.
we
submit
that
in
the
--
from
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
words,
those
interpretations
are
not
justified.
we
also
point
out
that
--
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
loss
of
substantial
economies
of
any
sort.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
yes.
well,
that's
right.
this
can
be
secured.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
that's
one
of
their
interpretations
but
i
--
in
order
to
--
in
order
to
expressly
give
the
meaning
that
s.
e.
c.
wants
to
give
to
this
language,
you'll
have
to
add
15
words
--
15
words
to
this
section.
there's
--
and
this
section
only
has
34.
you
have
to
add
the
words
loss
of
substantial
economies
“to
such
independent
systems
so
great
as
to
make
them
incapable
of
independent
economic
operation.”
all
those
words
would
have
to
be
added
for
congress
to
expressly
state
that
the
interpretations
of
s.
e.
c.
in
regard.
now,
we
point
out
that
the
express
intent
of
congress
in
--
is
in
accordance
with
the
ordinary
meaning
of
these
words,
70
times
in
the
--
in
the
statute
of
the
public
interest
and
for
the
protection
of
consumers
and
investors
is
repeated
throughout
the
statute.
and
we
submit
that
measuring
the
facts
of
this
case
against
the
public
interest
and
the
interest
of
consumers
is
very
clear
that
--
that
in
--
the
interpretation
should
be
in
accordance
with
the
actual
words
of
the
statute.
also,
in
section
1
(c)
of
the
act,
it
--
there
it
--
it
is
stated
as
the
declared
purpose
of
the
act
in
accordance
with
which
all
the
section
should
be
interpreted
that
this
act
is
intended
to
--
to
cure
certain
enumerated
evils
and
if
you
--
we
have
printed
section
1
(b)
where
those
evils
are
enumerated
in
--
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
and
after
careful
consideration
of
them
we'll
indicate
that
there's
--
there
are
none
of
those
involved
here
at
all.
in
the
reply
brief
filed
yesterday,
the
s.
e.
c.
suggested
that
--
that
the
section
11
(b)
(4)
--
11
(b)
(4)
might
be
here
involved.
now,
11
(b)
(4)
is
one
of
the
evils
that
is
when
the
growth
and
extension
of
holding
companies
bears
no
relation
to
economy
of
management
and
operation
or
the
integration
of
coordinated
--
coordination
of
related
progress.
there
is
no
question
here
involved
of
growth
or
extension.
we
have
had
these
gas
properties
since
1927.
there's
--
there
is
no
question
here
about
integration
or
coordination.
the
gas
properties
are
entirely
within
the
electric
territory
which
we
said,
so
that
--
that
there's
no
evil
in
there
that
would
be
cured
by
this
order.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
if
your
honor
--
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
yes.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
yes,
if
your
honor
please.
the
history
of
the
enactment
of
the
act
shows
that
senator
wheeler's
statement
was
--
stands
alone
of
anything
to
support
this
interpretation
by
the
s.
e.
c.
it
was
made
two
days
after
the
crucial
vote
in
the
house.
the
house
vote
--
the
crucial
vote
in
the
house
came
on
--
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
yes.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
not
--
no.
his
--
his
statement
was
on
the
senate
floor
after
the
senate
had
passed
--
passed
it
and
the
senate
had
passed
the
bill
earlier
that
day
without
objection,
had
passed
the
--
agreed
to
the
conference
report.
but
two
days
before
--
two
days
before,
the
house
on
a
motion
to
inspect
the
--
the
conferees,
to
agree
to
the
compromise
had
--
had
voted.
that
was
the
crucial
thing,
the
house
agreement
to
the
--
so
i
say
that
it
has
no
bearing
on
the
interpretation
of
what
this
compromise
language
had
meant
as
far
as
the
house
--
what
the
house
was
referring
to.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
it
--
well,
if
your
honor
please.
senator
wheeler
was
a
strong
advocate
of
the
senate
version.
he
--
he
was
not
an
impartial
man
in
this
prize
at
all.
he
was
--
he
was
advocating
no
exceptions
whatsoever
to
the
one
integrated
system
and
it
be
rather
natural
that
he
would
intend
to
interpret
it
in
the
narrowest
sense.
the
compromise
was
known
as
the
(inaudible)
compromise
and
--
and
that
--
thank
you
very
much.
