well,
as
part
of
the
procedural
phrase
even
assuming
that
the
order
appealed
from
was
an
appealable
one,
then
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
the
other
aspect
of
the
procedural
question
is
whether
or
not
you
can
have
after
the
time
appealable
has
expired
and
appeal
through
the
medium
of
a
motion
to
vacate.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
we
don't
have
such
a
procedure
known
as
a
motion
for
new
trial
before
the
s.e.c.
anyway,
did
he?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
monroe,
was
not
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
the
proper
place
to
make
this
factual
showing
that
you've
just
related?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
and
they
had
jurisdiction
to
determine
the
controversy,
did
they
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
they
did
determine
it,
did
they
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
had
a
certain
time
within
which
to
appeal,
did
you
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no
appeal
was
taken.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
then
is
it
your
argument
that
the
louisiana
commission,
a
year-and-a-half
later
can
come
to
this
proceeding
on
a
motion
to
reopen
and
without
showing
change
of
condition
and
limit
itself
to
those
changes
of
condition,
have
a
rehearing
of
the
matter
heard
and
determined
by
the
commission
a
year-and-a-half
before?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
other
words,
that
it
was
wrong?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
even
though
findings?
