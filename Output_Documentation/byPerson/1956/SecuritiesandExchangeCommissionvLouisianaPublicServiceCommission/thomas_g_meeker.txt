mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
may
it
please
the
court.
may
i
call
to
the
court's
attention
at
the
outset
that
we
have
handed
out
for
the
court's
convenience
and
have
also
distributed
to
counsel
a
compendium
of
those
unpublished
releases
of
the
commission
under
the
holding
company
act
referred
to
in
our
brief,
as
well
as
a
copy
of
the
public
utility
holding
company
act
of
1935.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
fifth
circuit.
it
involves
an
extraordinary
situation
whereby
the
respondent,
louisiana
public
service
commission,
through
the
device
of
appealing
from
a
1955
order
of
our
commission
which
merely
denied
a
petition
to
reopen
obtained
in
the
court
below
more
than
two
years
after
the
time
for
review
had
expired,
review
of
a
1953
s.e.c.
order
entered
pursuant
to
section
11
(b)
of
the
act.
the
anomaly
created
by
the
court's
decision
below
is
even
more
obvious
if
the
court
considers
for
a
moment
what
would
happen
--
what
would
have
happen
if
instead
of
having
filed
a
petition
to
reopen
in
1955,
the
respondent
louisiana
commission
had
filed
a
petition
for
review
in
an
appropriate
court
of
appeals.
there
can
be
no
question
but
what
if
under
section
24
of
the
act,
that
if
the
petition
for
review
had
been
filed
in
1955,
the
court
would
have
to
dismiss
that
petition
for
one
of
jurisdiction.
now,
there
are
two
orders
that
are
involved
in
this
case,
although
there
is
one
order
which
was
on
review
before
the
--
initially
on
review
before
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
first
of
the
orders
which
i
referred
to
was
our
commission's
order
of
march
1953
which
was
entered
pursuant
to
section
11
(b)
(1)
of
the
public
utility
holding
company
act
referred
to
and
included
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
at
page
49
which
directed
the
intervening
respondent,
the
middle
south
utilities,
inc.,
and
--
a
registered
holding
company
and
its
wholly
owned
subsidiary,
the
respondent,
louisiana
power
&
light
company,
to
divest
themselves
of
louisiana
powers
non-electric
assets
pursuant
to
section
11
(b)
(1).
i
might
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
commission's
opinion
which
is
found
at
page
103
of
the
transcript
of
record
as
well
as
the
commission's
order
which
is
found
at
page
127,
and
calling
the
court's
particular
attention
to
page
128
in
the
latter
part
of
the
commission's
order
of
1953,
i
would
like
the
court's
indulgence
just
to
read
the
language
there,
a
part
of
the
language
of
that
order.
it
is
ordered
pursuant
to
section
11
(b)
(1)
of
the
act
that
middle
south
and
its
subsidiaries,
one
of
which
is
louisiana
power,
dispose
their
cause
--
the
disposition
of
their
direct
and
indirect
ownership
in
the
non-electric
properties
owned
by
arkansas,
louisiana
and
mississippi
in
any
appropriate
manner
not
in
contravention
of
the
applicable
provisions
of
the
act
or
the
rules
and
regulations
promulgated
thereunder.
and
then
in
the
latter
--

thomas
g.
meeker

portion

mr.
thomas
g.
meeker

128
of
the
transcript
of
the
record.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
128,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
and
in
the
last
paragraph,
the
commission
reserved
jurisdiction
to
take
further
steps
in
the
future
as
might
be
necessary
and
appropriate
to
give
effects
--
effect
to
that
portion
of
its
order.
the
second
commission
order
which
is
involved
in
this
case
is
the
order
of
the
commission
of
september
1955
which
denied
the
louisiana
state
commission's
petition
to
reopen
the
1953
order
to
which
i
have
just
called
the
court's
attention.
now,
the
order
in
1953
was
the
result
of
a
series,
a
long
series
of
hearings
and
proceedings
under
section
11
commencing
back
in
1942.
suffice
that
to
say
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
that
in
1949,
among
other
things,
the
commission
acting
pursuant
to
section
11
(b)
(1)
approved
the
creation
of
the
middle
south
utilities,
inc.,
as
a
holding
company
and
reserved
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
middle
south
for
the
purpose
of
making
determinations
in
the
future
as
to
the
retainability
by
middle
south
and
its
subsidiaries
and
in
this
case,
louisiana
power,
of
certain
non-electric
properties.
now,
acting
under
the
reservation
in
its
order
of
1949,
in
january
1953,
the
commission,
pursuant
again
to
section
11
(b)
(1)
and
other
sections
of
the
act,
issued
a
notice
--
an
order
to
middle
south
and
louisiana
power
and
others.
in
connection
with
that
notice
appearing,
i
should
like
to
call
to
the
court'
attention
page
83
of
the
record
and
towards
the
top
of
the
page,
paragraph
number
3,
the
specific
--
one
of
the
specific
issues
enumerated
in
that
notice
of
hearing
whether
middle
south
and
louisiana
should
be
required
to
take
action
to
dispose
of
the
gas
utility
assets
and
non-utility
assets
of
louisiana,
and
if
so,
what
terms
and
conditions
should
be
imposed
in
connection
therewith?
and
i
think
it's
rather
important
also
to
notice
in
connection
with
this
order
that
in
the
last
paragraph
thereof,
the
secretary
acting
upon
orders
of
the
commission
is
very
careful
to
provide
for
a
registered
notice
and
registered
mail
service
upon
each
of
the
public
service
commissions
involved
including
the
respondent,
louisiana
public
service
commission.
now,
in
considering
the
facts
of
the
case,
one
thing
is
absolutely
certain
and
that
is
that
the
louisiana
public
service
commission
got
notice
of
this
hearing
in
1953.
there
is
no
question
or
no
dispute
about
that.
there
is
also
no
question
about
the
fact
that
the
hearing
which
was
noticed,
as
i've
just
called
to
the
court's
attention,
for
february
1953
was
a
full
hearing,
an
evidentiary
hearing.
the
respondents,
louisiana
power
and
middle
south
filed
an
answer
which
is
found
in
full
at
page
84
of
the
record.
evidence
was
adduced
with
opportunity
for
cross-examination.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
that
the
public
service
commission
received
notice
and
was
entitled
to
come
in
as
a
person
or
a
party
if
it
so
desired
pursuant
to
the
rules
of
practice
of
the
commission
and
it
was
specifically
given
notice
so
that
it
would
have
that
opportunity
if
it
desired.
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
there
was
a
direct
and
cross-examination,
an
opportunity
for
the
same,
there
were
arguments
presented
in
support
of
middle
south's
position
and
of
louisiana
power's
position
which
in
short
was
that
louisiana
power's
gas
properties
ought
to
be
permitted
to
be
retained
by
middle
south
and
louisiana
as
an
additional
integrated
public
utility
system
within
the
proviso
to
section
11
(b)
(1),
known
as
clause
(a)
to
which
i
will
refer
later
on
in
the
course
of
my
argument.
but
it's
perfectly
clear
that
louisiana
failed
to
appear,
that
is
the
louisiana
state
commission,
when
it
had
the
opportunity.
it's
also
interesting
to
note
that
no
one
asked
for
an
extension,
they
were
so
concerned
about
these
legal
determinations
as
to
which
they
know
call
--
raise
as
substantial
issues.
no
one
asked
for
an
extension,
neither
middle
south
nor
louisiana
power.
now,
in
march,
the
commission
issued
its
findings
and
opinion
and
order
and
they
are
found
in
the
record,
the
opinion
is
found
from
pages
104
to
126
and
the
order
is
found
at
page
127.
in
short,
the
commission
ordered
that
middle
south
and
louisiana
power
divest
themselves
of
all
of
the
non-electric
assets
of
louisiana
power.
and
when
i
say
non-electric
assets,
i'm
referring
to
the
gas
properties
and
to
one
water
property.
the
reason
that
the
commission
gave
in
its
findings
and
opinion
was
that
middle
south
and
louisiana
power
had
failed
to
establish
that
separation
of
the
gas
assets
held
by
louisiana
power
would
result
in
the
loss
of
substantial
economies
to
that
additional
system.
and
in
talking
about
additional
system,
we
are
talking
about
the
gas
properties
of
louisiana
power
as
required
by
clause
(a)
of
section
11
(b)
(1)
so
as
to
justify
the
retention
of
those
gas
assets
along
with
the
electric
assets
of
the
middle
south
system.
now,
very
few
things
happened
from
that
point
on
until
1954
and
the
only
things
that
did
happen
looked
toward
compliance
with
the
commission's
1953
order
which
was
entered
after
a
full
hearing.
not
only
was
there
no
petition
for
rehearing
filed
within
five
days
as
is
provided
by
our
rules
of
practice,
but
neither
middle
south
nor
louisiana
power
sought
to
challenge
the
commission's
substantive
determinations
which
are
raised
very
definitely
in
the
yellow
brief,
the
brief
of
louisiana
power
&
light
company.
no
one
challenged
the
substantive
determinations
within
the
60-day
period
as
is
provided
by
statute
under
section
24
(a)
of
the
act
within
which
a
petition
for
review
might
be
filed.
as
i
have
suggested,
every
action
gave
an
appearance
of
compliance.
in
fact
as
the
record
will
demonstrate
at
pages
88
and
89,
middle
south
and
louisiana
power
asked
for
additional
time
pursuant
to
section
11
(e)
of
the
act
within
which
to
comply,
to
comply
with
the
order
of
1953.
and
the
commission
extended
until
march
of
1955,
the
time
within
which
the
company's
might
come
in
and
comply
with
the
1953
directive.
now,
on
november
10th,
1954,
they
took
another
step.
louisiana
power
and
louisiana
gas
service
corporation,
in
short
referred
to
as
louisiana
gas
which
is
a
newly
organized
and
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
louisiana
power,
filed
an
application-declaration
with
the
commission
under
the
act
proposing
among
other
things
that
the
gas
properties
which
the
middle
south
and
louisiana
power
had
been
directed
to
dispose
of
be
transferred
along
with
the
other
non-electric
properties
to
louisiana
gas
as
a
step
looking
forward
--
looking
toward
compliance
with
the
1953
order.
now,
finally
a
year
and
nine
months
after
the
1953
11
(b)
order
to
which
they
had
been
working
compliance
with,
louisiana
commission
sends
a
telegram,
telegrams
found
in
the
record
at
page
89.
and
the
substance
of
the
telegram
and
the
subsequent
petition
and
supplemental
petition
filed
and
found
at
the
record
from
pages
90
to
92
was
the
commission
opened
up
the
record
in
year
1953
proceeding.
we
would
like
to
come
in
and
present
some
important
additional
evidence.
for
example,
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
brief
on
behalf
of
louisiana
public
service
commission
and
particularly
to
the
paragraph
on
page
--
the
two
paragraphs
on
page
51,
the
--
the
second
and
third
paragraphs
in
which
the
commission
has
asked
to
consider
new
evidence.
now,
the
commission
asked
for
an
offer
of
proof
and
at
the
request
of
the
louisiana
commission,
extended
the
time
for
its
filing.
the
offer
of
proof
was
received.
it
is
found
in
the
transcript
of
record,
commencing
on
page
1
and
at
page
5
thereof
in
the
offer
of
proof,
the
louisiana
commission
sets
forth
the
general
reasons
on
which
it
bases
its
request
for
reopening.
briefs
were
submitted
and
oral
argument
was
had.
and
subsequently
in
september,
the
commission
came
out
with
an
opinion
and
order.
the
opinion
is
found
commencing
at
the
record
at
129
and
the
order
at
the
record
133
and
denied
the
petition
for
reopening
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
basis
for
reopening
the
proceedings
in
its
opinion.
now,
in
its
opinion
--
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
in
the
offer
of
proof,
they
offered
to
introduce
evidence
with
respect
to
the
operations
of
the
companies
in
1954,
evidence
as
to
the
cost
of
those
operations
and
the
relative
cost
and
perhaps
losses
which
would
occur
if
divestment
were
to
be
carried
through
and
they
had
to
comply
but
those
were
based
in
1954.
and
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief
just
filed
today,
the
--
the
figures
which
they
offer
in
connection
with
their
offer
of
proof
are
in
effect
new
data.
they
are
based
on
new
year's
earnings.
in
fact
in
1952,
the
commission
was
considering
figures
which
were
before
it
on
the
basis
of
the
operations
in
1952.here,
they
come
in
now
two
years
later
and
they
want
to
give
new
information
or
new
data
based
on
operations
for
the
year-end
in
1954.
now,
the
louisiana
commission
filed
its
petition
for
review
in
the
court
below,
requesting
a
review
of
the
commission's
denial
of
its
petition
to
reopen
and
also
requesting
a
review
of
the
commission's
order
of
march
1953,
the
divestment
order.
we
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss,
the
petition
on
the
ground
that
in
essence
it
was
an
attempt
to
appeal
from
an
order
as
to
which
the
time
for
appeal
had
long
since
expired.
the
court
below
found
first
that
the
commission's
order
of
1955,
denying
the
petition
to
reopen
was
reviewable
and
set
it
aside.
it
held
that
the
s.e.c.,
the
commission
had
in
effect
misinterpreted
the
--
in
the
1953
proceeding
clause
(a)
of
section
11
(b)
(1)
in
legal
determinations
made
in
that
proceeding
in
connection
with
the
retainability
by
louisiana
power
of
its
non-electric
properties
and
it
remanded
the
matter
to
us
for
consideration
in
light
of
own
its
construction
of
clause
(a)
of
section
11
(b)
(1).
now,
we
think
the
court
below
was
wrong,
both
on
the
procedural
point
and
the
substantive
issue.
the
one
thing
i
would
like
to
say,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
you
before
proceeding
to
my
argument
is
that
i
think
upon
examination
of
the
offer
of
proof,
the
petition
and
the
supplemental
petition,
the
court
will
readily
see
that
there
was
no
allegation
in
any
of
those
documents
of
a
change
in
conditions.
and
i
think
that
as
we
will
try
to
contend
to
demonstrate
to
the
court
that
is
an
important
aspect
of
what
has
been
referred
to
in
this
case
as
the
procedural
phase
of
it.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
we
would
still
contend
that
it
was
not
within
the
scope
of
--
proper
scope
of
review
of
an
order
of
an
administrative
agency
such
as
ours.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
that
is
the
most
serious
and
shocking
aspect
of
the
case
as
far
as
we
are
concerned,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
now,
we
contend
first
of
all,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
the
court
below
committed
error
in
permitting
this
1955
attack
upon
a
final
and
binding
1953
directive
of
our
commission.
in
so
doing,
the
court
relied
on
the
last
two
sentences
of
section
11
(b).
and
if
the
court
will
indulge
me
once
again,
i
should
like
to
examine
for
the
court
the
last
two
sentences
of
11
(b)
because
we
think
the
court
below
was
wrong.
those
sentences
are
found
on
page
50
of
our
brief,
the
appendix
there
to
our
brief.
now,
it
is
interesting
to
know
in
going
through
the
legislative
history
of
this
particular
part
of
11
(b)
that
nobody
seems
to
know
how
these
last
two
sentences
got
into
the
public
utility
holding
company
act.
there
is
no
legislative
history
to
guide
us.we
believe
though
that
the
reason
for
their
inclusion
becomes
apparent
on
a
sentence
by
sentence
examination
of
those
last
two
sentences
of
11
(b).
taking
the
last
sentence
first,
it
reads,
"any
order
made
under
this
subsection
shall
be
subject
to
judicial
review
as
provided
in
section
24."
now,
that
merely
repeats
--
that
merely
repeats
the
provision
for
appeal
as
contained
in
section
24.
and
before
i
pass
the
legislative
history,
i
would
like
to
interrupt
the
train
just
a
moment
to
point
out
as
i
neglected
to
do
that
the
last
two
sentences
were
apparently
added
in
the
conference
on
the
legislation
and
that
may
explain
the
reason
why
they're
having
been
added
at
the
last
moment,
there
is
no
explanation
in
writing
for
them.
but
the
last
sentences
i
have
indicated
merely
indicates
that
--
that
section
24
is
applicable
in
an
11
(b)
situation.
now,
presumably
an
order
under
11
(b)
would
be
reviewable
in
the
absence
of
this
last
sentence,
of
the
last
paragraph
of
11
(b).i
think
this
shows
in
effect
that
congress
was
concerned.
they
were
concerned
lest
one
of
these
most
important
orders
and
i
believe
the
louisiana
power
company
has
referred
to
an
order
under
this
section
as
the
death
sentence
for
which
they
seek
commutation.
it
is
that
type
of
important
order
that
is
involved
here
and
it
is
an
order
of
unusual
nature
in
the
sense
that
it
looks
toward
future
compliance.
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
there
was
some
discussion
about
the
fact
that
the
actual
compliance
with
this
order
comes
much
later
and
the
history
of
the
proceedings
under
section
11
(b)
confirmed
the
wisdom
of
that
legislative
prophecy.
and
i
think
also
that
the
lawyers
who
were
the
draftsmen
here
were
properly
concerned
perhaps
that
maybe
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
type
of
11
(b)
order
looked
towards
the
future
was
in
effect
a
directive
to
the
systems
to
comply
at
some
future
date
to
come
in
with
a
plan
which
would
comply
with
the
standards
of
11
(b),
that
there
was
a
fear
on
the
part
of
the
lawyer-legislators
that
this
might
be
attacked
as
an
interlocutory
order
from
which
there
was
no
appeal.
and
it
was
such
an
important
order
i
think
that
congress
and
we
can
at
best
speculate
but
i
think
it
is
logical
so
to
do
that
congress
felt
that
there
ought
to
be
a
specific
right
of
appeal
from
this
type
of
order.
now,
looking
at
the
first
sentence,
if
i
may
refer
now
to
that,
the
commission
may
by
order
revoke
or
modify
any
order
previously
made
under
this
subsection
if
after
notice
an
opportunity
for
hearing
it
finds
that
the
conditions
upon
which
the
order
was
predicated
do
not
exist.
now,
we
believe
that
this
language
was
inserted
because
congress
was
concerned
that
perhaps
an
order
would
be
issued
under
11
(b)
based
upon
a
set
of
particular
conditions
existing
at
a
particular
time
which
looked
forward
to
compliance
at
a
later
date.
and
that
in
the
intervening
period
from
the
date
of
the
11
(b)
order
and
the
future
time
at
which
compliance
might
be
affected,
there
could
be
a
change
of
conditions
and
this
being
such
an
important
order,
there
ought
to
be
an
opportunity
for
the
parties
to
come
in
and
to
seek
a
modification
or
revocation
thereof
if
the
conditions
had
changed
so
that
perhaps
the
order
issued
earlier
was
no
longer
appropriate
for
the
new
conditions.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
insertion
of
this
provision
for
this
purpose
makes
awfully
good
sense.
we
don't
believe
that
congress
had
in
mind
as
the
court
suggest
below
that
this
language,
this
first
sentence
was
to
be
used
to
come
in
for
reopening
almost
at
any
time
after
a
final
order
under
11
(b)
had
been
entered.
we
don't
believe
that
the
congress
have
that
in
mind
because
we
are
also
mindful
that
the
first
sentence
of
11
(b)
on
page
49
of
our
brief
says,
"it
shall
be
the
duty
of
the
commission
as
soon
as
practicable
after
january
1,
1938."
we
think
that
the
congress
had
in
mind
that
this
section
ought
to
--
or
that
a
compliance
with
this
section
ought
to
be
achieved
as
soon
as
possible.
and
such
a
determination
or
resolution
it
seems
to
us
to
be
completely
inconsistent
with
the
concept
that
this
first
sentence
opens
the
door
for
reopening
such
a
long
and
protracted
proceeding
almost
at
any
time
at
will
as
long
as
you
make
a
allegation
in
effect
that
the
record
before
the
commission
was
not
complete.
and
i
think
perhaps
that
it
would
be
well
to
credit
to
the
legislators,
perhaps,
this
concern
and
that
is
that
certainly
without
the
specific
statutory
authorization
given
to
the
commission,
it's
doubtful,
extremely
doubtful
under
existing
precedence
whether
it
would
have
had
the
power
or
would
have
the
power
to
reconsider
such
an
order
particularly
when
that
order
had
been
before
a
court
for
review.
thus,
we
think
that
these
sentences
have
meanings
which
are
contrary
to
the
interpretations
given
to
them
by
the
court
below.
as
to
the
first
sentence,
the
commission
has
consistently
interpreted
to
permit
modification
or
revocation
of
11
(b)
orders
only
in
the
light
of
change
in
circumstances
which
had
occurred
since
the
original
order
under
11
(b)
was
entered.
and
we
have
collected
at
page
18
of
our
brief
that
those
line
of
cases
were
commission
decisions.
now,
as
to
the
second
sentence,
the
commission
contends
that
it
means
that
11
(b)
orders
are
directly
reviewable
pursuant
to
section
24
(a)
of
the
act
which
is
found
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
in
which
provides
that
a
petition
for
review
must
be
filed
within
60
days.
once
60
days
has
elapsed,
it
is
the
commission's
position
--
if
60
days
have
gone
by
without
the
filing
of
a
petition
for
review,
we
contend
the
order,
the
11
(b)
order
is
no
longer
subject
to
challenge
by
an
attack
upon
the
conditions
found
to
have
existed
when
the
order
was
entered.
now,
we
believe
also
that
the
court
below
erred
in
holding
--
in
holding
that
section
11
(b)
authorizes
the
reopening
of
a
concluded
proceeding
without
a
showing
of
change
in
circumstance.
now,
let's
see
what
the
court
did
to
reach
this
interpretation.
the
court
construed
the
first
sentence,
which
we
have
just
reviewed,
to
permit
a
modification
where
it
can
be
shown
that
the
conditions
on
which
the
order
was
predicated
were
not
truly
the
actual
condition
or
in
other
words
in
the
court's
own
language
found
at
the
record
138
that
modification
might
be
based
on
the
facts
as
they
existed
of
the
time
of
the
order
which
is
to
be
modified.
now,
this
is
--
interpretation
in
our
opinion
is
nothing
but
an
open
invitation
to
anyone
in
an
11
(b)
proceeding
who
thinks
he
might
have
made
a
better
case
at
some
later
date
to
come
along
and
file
a
petition
for
rehearing.
and
we
think
that
if
this
court
agrees
with
us
in
our
construction
that
it
ought
--
just
plain
reverse
and
go
no
further
with
any
of
the
issues
in
the
case.
to
put
it
in
another
way,
if
this
decision
below
is
allowed
to
stand,
all
someone
has
to
do
who
has
rights
in
such
a
proceeding
is
to
make
a
mere
allegation
that
data
in
the
original
record
before
our
commission
is
incomplete
and
this
decision
will
open
the
door.
this
type
of
reopening
is
rare
indeed
in
the
life
of
an
administrative
agency.
it
is
even
rarer
when
the
court
below
requires
the
administrative
agency
to
reconsider
its
decision
made
in
another
--
in
an
earlier
proceeding
as
to
which
it
has
issued
a
final
order
back
in
1953.
we
say
that
this
result
reached
by
the
court
below
could
only
be
reached
if
the
statutory
language
is
so
clear
that
it
precludes
any
other
interpretation.
and
frankly,
it
is
our
position
that
the
language
of
the
first
sentence
doesn't
compel
any
such
construction
as
placed
upon
it
by
the
court
below.
it
is
contrary
to
the
congressional
intent.
we
believe
that
in
putting
in
this
sentence,
the
congress
was
mindful
of
its
own
admission
--
admonition
in
11
(b)
to
obtain
compliance
as
soon
as
practicable.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
exactly.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
exactly.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
exactly.
if
this
court
agrees
with
the
commission's
interpretation
--
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
well,
we
take
the
position
that
the
petition
for
reopening
under
these
circumstances
is
wholly
discretionary
with
the
commission
and
that
there
might
be
a
situation
where
--
in
an
extreme
situation
where
you
could
perhaps
show
an
abuse
of
such
discretion
but
certainly
that's
not
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
well,
perhaps
if
there
was
a
showing
of
fraud
on
the
agency
and
the
agency
just
refused
to
pay
any
attention
to
it,
i
would
consider
that
a
real
abuse
of
discretion.
but
there
is
certainly
none
of
that
here
as
the
--
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
well,
may
i
say
this,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
it
seems
to
me
from
reviewing
the
cases
they
have
pretty
consistently
held
that
as
far
as
the
petition
for
rehearing
is
concerned
before
an
administrative
agency,
it
is
a
matter
wholly
within
the
discretion
of
the
agency.
i
understand
that
there
was
a
case
many
years
ago
involving
the
i.c.c.
which
held
to
the
contrary,
the
atchison
case.
but
subsequently,
in
i.c.c.
versus
jersey
city,
this
court
very
clearly
restricted
the
decision
in
that
case
to
the
facts
of
that
case.
and
in
direct
answer
to
your
question,
i
would
say
we
contend
that
a
petition
for
rehearing
is
wholly
in
the
discretion
of
the
administrative
agency,
although
i
would
not
eliminate
the
possibility
of
an
extreme
situation
where
the
agency
acted
manifestly
with
arbitrariness
in
complete
disregard
of
some
patent
fact
that
it
ought
to
construe.
as
i
was
about
to
say
if
this
court
agrees
with
the
commission's
interpretation
of
the
first
sentence,
we
submit
that
that's
as
far
as
this
honorable
court
need
to
go
and
it
should
promptly
reverse
the
decision
below.
now,
the
interpretation
by
the
court
below
of
the
second
sentence
is
in
our
opinion
clearly
inconsistent
with
the
review
provisions
of
section
24
(a)
and
the
prevailing
precedence.
again,
may
i
call
your
attention
to
the
second
sentence,
"any
order
made
under
this
subsection
shall
be
subject
to
judicial
review
as
provided
in
section
24."
now,
what
did
the
court
hold
below
with
respect
to
this
sentence?
it
held
first
of
all
that
it
could
review
an
s.e.c.
order
denying
a
petition
to
reopen.
in
the
second
instance,
it
held
that
it
could
require
this
commission
to
consider
matters
which
could
have
been
but
which
were
not
presented
in
the
full
hearing
in
1953.
and
thirdly,
it
held
that
it
could
review
at
the
same
time
legal
determinations
made
by
our
commission
in
connection
with
the
1953
proceeding.
now,
this
interpretation
runs
completely
counter
to
the
prevailing
general
rule
that
in
the
interest
of
the
end
of
litigation,
a
failure
to
file
a
timely
petition
for
review
jurisdictionally
precludes
appellate
review.
as
i
have
suggested
earlier,
the
acceptance
of
this
decision
below
in
our
view
creates
a
real
absurdity,
to
wit
by
filing
a
petition
for
rehearing,
the
louisiana
commission
can
now
obtain
a
full
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
order
denying
the
petition
for
reopening
as
well
as
the
1953
order,
whereas
if
the
same
commission
had
filed
a
petition
for
review
on
the
same
date
in
an
appropriate
court
of
appeals,
it
would
have
to
be
dismissed.
now,
even
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
the
denial
of
an
application
for
modification
is
appealable,
we
believe
the
court's
interpretation
of
the
last
sentence
was
an
error,
both
as
to
the
availability
of
judicial
review
and
the
scope
of
judicial
review.
admittedly,
orders
under
section
11
(b)
which
actually
revoke
or
modify
previous
orders
are
reviewable.
that
we
concede.
but
the
last
sentence
of
11
(b)
is
interpreted
by
the
court
below
as
making
the
denial
of
a
request
to
reopen
expressly
reviewable,
while
the
words
"any
order
under
this
subsection"
as
are
used
therein
are
there.
we
submit
the
only
orders
mentioned
in
this
section
are
these.
first,
orders
directing
that
certain
action
be
taken
either
integration
or
simplification.
and
second,
that
orders
revoking
or
modifying
such
original
orders.
there's
absolutely
no
mentioned
in
this
section
of
orders
denying
a
petition
for
reopening.
certainly,
action
taken
by
the
commission
which
takes
the
form
of
an
order
and
which
is
not
required
by
the
act
to
be
affected
by
order
is
not
normally
reviewable.
for
example,
it
has
been
held
in
a
court
of
appeals
decision,
eastern
utilities
associates
versus
s.e.c.
in
162
f.2d,
that
an
order
of
the
commission
setting
11
(b)
proceeding
down
for
a
hearing
is
not
reviewable.
now,
even
assuming
once
again
that
under
certain
circumstances
there
may
be
a
review
of
an
order
denying
revocation
or
modification
after
hearing.
we
contend
that
such
a
review
would
nevertheless
be
unavailable
under
this
second
sentence
from
the
denial
of
a
petition
to
reopen
without
hearing
to
the
extent
that
the
petition
is
based
on
facts
which
existed
at
the
time
of
the
original
order.
thus,
even
if
the
first
sentence
were
construed
to
authorize
the
commission,
the
s.e.c.
to
revoke
or
modify
a
prior
order
upon
a
finding
as
the
court
below
suggest
that
conditions
upon
which
it
was
predicated
did
not
truly
exist
at
the
time
of
the
entry
of
the
original
11
(b)
order,
it
does
not
follow
that
such
denial
would
be
reviewed.
it's
no
different
in
our
view
from
any
other
petition
for
rehearing.
there
seems
to
be
no
reason
in
our
opinion
why
the
denial
of
such
petition
in
essence
only
a
petition
for
rehearing
should
be
anymore
subject
to
review
than
the
denial
of
any
other
petition
for
rehearing,
the
normal
basis
for
which
that
some
falls
in
the
record.
it
is
fairly
well
set
of
law
the
denial
of
the
petition
for
rehearing
is
wholly
discretionary.
certainly,
it
is
clear
in
the
law
that
a
party,
after
the
time
for
appeal
has
expired,
may
not
reinvest
himself
with
the
right
of
appeal
by
filing
a
petition
for
rehearing.
i
call
to
the
court's
attention,
conboy
versus
first
national
bank
of
jersey
city
in
203
u.s.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
well,
if
it's
a
proceeding
or
a
new
trial
on
newly
discovered
evidence,
assume
you
would
get
into
the
question
of
the
term
of
the
court
and
whatnot
which
may
not
be
issue
--
an
issue
in
the
federal
court.but
in
our
view
under
this
act,
just
new
evidence
alone
is
not
sufficient
to
be
a
basis
for
the
reviewability
of
such
--
what
we
consider
to
be
a
wholly
discretionary
order.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
well,
we
have
a
procedure
which
would
enable
the
respondents
here
to
come
in
for
a
rehearing
within
five
days
--
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
--
under
our
rules
of
practice
but
not
one
that
analogous
to
what
mr.
justice
harlan
has
suggested.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
we
take
the
position
that
there
was
--
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
exactly
that
there
was
no
allegation
here
or
indication
of
a
change
in
the
circumstances
or
facts
and
we
take
that
position
on
the
basis
of
what
the
louisiana
commission
filed
with
our
commission
and
what
--
what
is
included
from
the
transcript
of
record.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
well,
that's
--
that's
correct
and
if
that
is
so
--
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
we
take
the
position
on
the
contrary,
if
your
honor
pleases,
that
it's
the
plain
sense
of
--
of
this
provision
read
in
light
of
the
entire
act
and
the
purpose
of
11
(b)
that
this
language
was
put
in
there
to
enable
someone
who
was
faced
with
such
a
change
of
conditions
that
made
the
original
11
(b)
order
almost
non-compliable,
where
he
could
come
in
and
seek
a
modification
or
revocation.
but
just
to
--
to
come
in
and
challenge
the
truth
to
the
facts
as
they
existed
before,
we
don't
believe
that
this
goes
that
far.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
we
don't
have
to
reach
that
question
here.
if
they
had
tried
it
out
under
the
language
of
the
statute,
which
provides
for
a
notice,
an
opportunity
for
hearing
on
the
question
of
modification
or
revocation
and
they
had
a
full
evidentiary
hearing,
which
was
not
held
here
on
that
question,
then
i
think
we
have
a
different
case.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
they're
--
they
are
--
they
--
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
back
in
1953?
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
as
i
have
indicated
to
the
court,
we
consider
this
no
different
from
any
other
petition
for
rehearing.
and
as
we
believe
it,
well
established
in
the
law,
there
seems
to
be
no
reason
why
this
is
not
a
matter
completely
within
the
discretion
of
the
commission.
now,
at
page
138
of
the
record
in
its
decision,
the
court
below
said,
"its
review
was
not
circumscribed
by
the
rules
applying
to
review
of
discretionary
acts."
now,
we
contend
that
that
is
error.
we
contend
that
the
last
sentence
of
11
(b)
provides
only
that
the
commission
may
revoke
or
modify
its
previous
order
whereas
other
provisions
of
section
11
(b)
used
mandatory
language.
for
example,
on
page
50,
right
above
the
last
two
sentences,
the
court
will
note
that
the
statute
employs
the
use
of
the
word
"shall".
it
is
our
contention
that
this
discretionary
nature
of
the
pertinent
phrases
dictates
the
judicial
review
if
any
should
be
eliminated
to
considerations
of
abuses
of
discretions
and
certainly
none
can
be
shown
here,
all
one
has
to
do
is
to
examine
the
commission's
opinion
and
to
examine
the
offer
of
proof
which
did
not
allege
or
indicate
that
the
original
factual
in
conclusions
were
incorrect.
the
abuse
of
discretion
is
not
shown
here
and
we
feel
that
the
court
went
far
beyond
the
permissible
scope
of
review.
now,
in
the
few
moments
that
i
have
left
here,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
in
fact
that
there
are
substantive
issues.
it's
our
position
that
you
don't
--
that
your
honors
do
not
have
to
reach
those
questions
here,
that
there
is
--
in
the
procedural
aspects
of
this
case
a
sufficient
basis
for
prompt
reversal
of
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
but
i
would
like
to
mention
in
a
very
brief
outline
just
what
the
substantive
issues
are
and
it
maybe
that
i
will
not
get
to
our
position
on
them
and
perhaps
until
my
rebuttal
time
and
i
hope
the
court
will
indulge
me
if
that
would
be
the
case.
calling
the
substantive
issues
which
have
been
decided
by
the
commission
in
its
1953
proceeding
and
reviewed
by
the
court
below
involved
interpretations
of
what
is
referred
to
as
clause
(a)
of
section
11
(b)
(1)
found
on
page
49
of
our
brief.
and
if
the
court
would
read
from
the
italicized
language
beginning,
"provided
however
that
the
commission
shall
permit
a
registered
holding
company
to
continue
to
control
one
or
more
additional
integrated
public
utility
systems,
if,
after
notice
and
opportunity
for
hearing,
it
finds
that
a,"
and
this
is
clause
(a),
"each
of
such
additional
systems
cannot
be
operated
as
an
independent
system
without
the
loss
for
substantial
economies,"
and
those
are
crucial
words,
"which
can
be
secured
by
the
retention
of
control
by
such
holding
company
of
such
system."
now,
we
take
the
position
that
the
court
was
in
error
in
interpreting
this
particular
clause.
section
11
(b)
(1)
of
the
act
requires
that
the
operations
of
each
registered
holding
company
system
be
limited
to
a
single
integrated
public
utility
system
and
to
certain
incidental
businesses.
now,
this
proviso
to
11
(b)
(1),
clause
(a),
which
i
have
just
read,
permits
retention
of
one
or
more
additional
systems
as
an
exception
to
the
integration
requirements
if
it
can
be
shown
that
such
retention
meets
the
exacting
requirements
set
forth
not
only
in
clause
(a)
but
in
clause
(b)
and
(c).
now,
these
substantive
issues
revolve
around
the
words
loss
of
substantial
economy.
now,
first
in
construing
clause
(a),
the
question
is,
should
those
words
apply
to
the
principal
system,
middle
south
electric
properties
or
only
to
the
additional
system,
louisiana
gases
properties
--
gas
property?
and
second,
the
question
is,
what
is
meant
by
the
words
loss
of
substantial
economy?
those
two
questions
are
at
issue
if
the
court
has
to
reach
these
substantive
matters.
now,
we
contend
that
the
words
loss
of
substantial
economies
refers
only
to
the
potential
loss
which
would
be
incurred
by
the
additional
system,
the
gas
properties,
if
it
were
free
from
the
single
integrated
electric
utility
system.
and
second,
we
contend
that
loss
of
substantial
economy
means
that
the
free
utility
system,
the
gas
properties,
could
not
stand
on
its
own
feet
and
operate
economically
if
it
were
independent.
to
wit,
we
contend
that
congress
and
we
contend
also
and
can
demonstrate
we
believe
that
the
legislative
history
supports
us
in
this
position
that
congress
expected,
if
there
were
to
be
such
an
additional
system,
that
it
would
be
able
to
stand
on
its
own
feet
and
capable
of
managing
its
own
affairs.
unlike
the
last
two
sentences
of
section
--
of
11
(b)
which
we
have
discussed
at
length
here,
the
legislative
history
here
makes
it
clear
that
the
draftsman
intended
the
phrase
to
be
interpreted
as
it
has
been
interpreted
consistently
by
the
commission.and
may
i
again
ask
the
court's
indulgence
and
suggest
reference
to
our
brief
at
page
40.
but
i
think
that
at
that
point
i
will
reserve
my
further
remarks
on
the
substantive
issues
until
my
rebuttal
time.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
with
respect
to
clause
(a)
which
has
been
discussed
here
this
morning
again,
the
commission
rests
on
the
interpretation
found
on
page
40
in
the
conference
report
--
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
page
40
of
our
brief,
mr.
justice
douglas,
on
the
reports
of
the
conference
committee
found
right
at
the
top
of
page
40.
we
believe
that
is
the
substantial
legislative
history
for
the
interpretation
which
we
have
given
to
the
meaning
of
clause
(a).
the
respondents
have
indicated
that
it
cost
money
to
raise
money
and
with
that
we
agree
cost
money
to
raise
money.
in
1953,
they
didn't
bring
any
evidence
in
as
to
the
cost
of
raising
money
and
--
and
introduce
it
before
the
commission
then
and
we
think
it's
too
late
for
them
to
raise
that
question
now.
i
think
it's
interesting
to
note
also
from
the
record,
page
106,
that
one
commission
testified
in
this
1953
proceeding.
a
representative
of
the
new
orleans
city
commission,
public
utilities
commission,
was
testified
in
our
1953
proceeding
apparently
they
had
an
opportunity
to
get
prepared
to
appear
in
that
proceeding
and
did
actually
so
appear
and
testified,
at
least
a
representative
of
that
commission
testified
in
the
support
of
the
company's
position
in
that
proceeding.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
in
terms
of
modification
of
--
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
--
a
prior
order
--
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
there
are
found
in
--
in
page,
i
believe
it's
16
of
our
brief.
there
--
i
think
i
have
the
wrong
--
on
page
18
of
our
brief,
footnote
16,
we
have
collected
the
cases
in
which
this
problem
has
been
before
the
commission
--
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
i
didn't
--
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
the
--
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
the
commission
has
in
the
past
modified
on
application
in
the
showing
of
change
of
conditions
of
prior
order.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
no.
generally
on
the
application
--
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
well,
i
would
say
i
--
i'm
not
absolutely
certain
but
its
my
--
my
best
judgment
that
it's
been
almost
exclusively
on
the
basis
of
some
application
made
to
the
commission
and
not
on
its
--
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
--
own
motion.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
i
would
like
to
submit
that
to
your
honor,
i
don't
have
it
in
mind
at
the
moment.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
not
at
all,
your
honor.
i
will
submit
a
memorandum
promptly.
yesterday,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
inquired
as
to
the
nature
of
the
prior
proceedings
and
i
would
just
like
to
point
out
at
this
time
that
it
was
in
february
of
1940
that
the
commission
instituted
the
11
(b)
(1)
proceedings
against
electric
bond
and
share
as
has
been
mentioned
by
respondents
counsel
here
today,
including
louisiana
which
then
was
a
subsidiary
of
electric
power
&
light
corporation
which
at
that
time
was
a
subholding
company
of
electric
bond
and
share.
and
its
interesting
to
note
also
that
electric
power
&
light
became
registered
a
day
after
this
court's
decision
in
1938
which
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
the
registration
provisions
of
the
public
utility
holding
company
act.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
well,
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
in
this
case.
i
don't
believe
there's
any
indication
that
there's
been
a
change
of
any
conditions
or
circumstances
--
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
--
which
would
--
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
not
of
the
data
which
mr.
ainsworth
gave
this
court
or
as
--
or
the
commission
has
submitted
in
the
offer
of
proof
found
at
the
(inaudible)
of
the
record.
we
contend
shows
a
change
of
condition
which
would
be
the
basis
for
the
modification
of
--
of
the
prior
order.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
oh,
i
think
would
have
--
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
i
think
what
it
amounts
to,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
is
this.
there's
some
additional
evidence
which
they
should
have
produced
at
the
early
hearing.
in
other
--
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
but
--
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
but
the
commission
--
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
the
commission
had
notice
of
the
hearing
at
which
--
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
--
it
did
not
appear.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
well,
it's
certainly
as
obvious
from
reading
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
that
that
court
agreed
with
the
commission
that
there
wasn't
any
showing
of
change
of
conditions
or
else
there
wouldn't
--
that
court
wouldn't
have
gone
to
the
trouble
of
construing
the
sentence
as
it
did.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
well,
we
--
we
believe
they
have
to
--
both,
we
believe
they
have
to
show
a
change
of
condition
--
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
--
but
in
any
event
we
believe
it's
much
too
late
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
well,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
the
position
of
the
commission
that
this
is
a
case
where
the
court's
interest
in
finality
of
litigation
need
not
yield
to
any
other
interest
of
justice.
