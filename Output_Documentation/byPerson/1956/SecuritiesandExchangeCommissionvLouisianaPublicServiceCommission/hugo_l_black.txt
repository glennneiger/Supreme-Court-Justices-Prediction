justice

do
you
take
the
position
that
there
were
no
facts
alleged
here
showing
that
the
conditions
on
this
order
was
predicated,
it
didn't
exist?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
one
of
your
position
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
take
the
position
that
it's
only
after
allege
and
show
is
that
some
of
the
findings
you
made
before
were
not
true,
is
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
therefore,
they
do
not
exist
and
they
have
a
right
to
try
those
facts
over?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
had
made
allegation
that
there
were
new
and
changed
conditions,
something
like
justice
harlan
and
justice
--
and
a
nature
of
new
facts
and
circumstances
have
been
revealed
and
never
been
tried
out.
the
fact
is
just
completely
new
and
you
tried
it
out,
you
gave
them
a
try
and
you
have
to
reach
the
question
here
as
to
whether
they
had
done
that,
the
motion
to
be
appealable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
that
in
affect
they're
trying
to
get
a
new
trial
and
this
doesn't
allow
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
--
of
the
issues
that
were
tried
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
