mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
advert
briefly
to
some
of
the
facts
which
were
before
the
hearing
officer
and
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
when
they
rendered
their
discretionary
decision
in
this
case.
the
petitioners
applied
for
admission
to
the
united
states
as
seaman
in
pursuit
of
their
calling.
they
were
granted
surely
for
the
length
of
time
their
vessel
was
to
remain
in
port
and
in
any
event
not
to
exceed
29
days.
they
remained.
a
female
petitioner
did
not
tell
the
immigrant
inspector
that
she
was
pregnant
at
that
time.
they
never
applied
for
an
extension
of
stay
and
they
never
revealed
their
unlawful
presence
here
until
two
months
after
their
child
was
born.
at
that
time
and
that
was
roughly
six
months
after
the
female
petitioner
had
arrived,
five
months
after
the
male
petitioner
had
arrived,
they
appeared
at
the
office
of
the
immigration
service
in
new
york
and
stated,
“we
are
here
unlawfully,”
and
they
filed
their
applications
for
suspension
of
deportation
on
the
ground
that
their
deportation
would
result
in
serious
economic
detriment
to
their
newly
born
child.
the
hearing
officer
conducted
their
hearing
on
may
29th,
1952,
a
month
before
the
1952
act
was
even
enacted.
he
found
that
they
have
established
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
it
took
effect
in
december
of
1952
but
it
was
enacted
on
june
27th,
1952.
the
hearing
officer
found
that
they
had
established
the
statutory
requirements
for
eligibility
to
suspension.
he
found
that
there
was
serious
economic
detriment
to
their
child
and
that
they
were
persons
of
good
moral
character
and
that
they
were
not
aliens
ineligible
to
citizenship
and
the
other
items
which
the
statute
required.
but
in
the
exercise
of
discretion
he
felt
that
this
bounty,
the
maximum
bounty
which
the
statute
provided,
suspension
of
deportation
should
not
be
granted
to
them.
and
instead
he
granted
the
lesser
bounty
of
voluntary
departure
for
which
they
had
applied
in
the
alternative
if
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
he
found
them
deportable
because
they
were
really
immigrants
at
the
time
of
arrival
rather
than
non-immigrants.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
he
found
that
--
that
they
had
an
undisclosed
intention
not
to
depart
with
their
vessel.
and
therefore,
they
were
immigrants
and
needed
visas
which
they
did
not
have.
now,
in
--
in
denying
this
discretionary
relief
of
suspension,
he
stated
clearly
why
he
felt
the
petitioners
did
not
merit
this
relief
and
his
reasons
are
set
forth
in
his
opinion
which
is
set
forth
in
the
record
appearing
at
page
7.
at
page
9
of
the
opinion
--
of
the
hearing
officer's
opinion
he
states,
“it
is
not
believed
that
as
a
matter
of
administrative
discretion
the
respondent's
application
for
suspension
of
deportation
should
be
granted.
they
have
been
on
the
united
states
for
a
period
of
less
than
one
year.
they
have
no
relatives
in
this
country
other
than
each
other
and
their
son.
to
grant
both
this
form
of
relief
upon
the
accident
of
birth
in
the
united
states
of
their
son
would
be
to
deprive
others
who
are
patiently
awaiting
visas
under
their
already
oversubscribed
quotas.
it
is
noted
also
that
neither
respondent
reported
his
and
her
presence
in
the
united
states
at
any
time
until
january
1952
when
they
filed
applications
for
suspension.”
so
that
it
cannot
be
said
that
the
hearing
officer
ascribed
no
reason
for
the
denial
of
suspension.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
in
this
particular
case
it
is
not
the
greek
quota
which
would
be
affected
at
all.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
these
are
greek
nationals
but
the
record
brings
out
that
the
female
petitioner
was
born
in
russia
and
the
male
petitioner
was
born
in
turkey,
and
under
the
immigration
laws
it
is
the
country
of
birth
which
determines
the
quota
rather
than
the
country
of
nationality.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
turkey
has
a
low
quota
and
both
the
russian
and
the
turkish
quotas
are
oversubscribed.
although,
they
are
not
mortgaged
nearly
so
heavily
as
the
greek
quota.
so
that
counsel's
reference
to
the
fact
that
this
is
a
very
impractical
reason
ascribed
by
the
hearing
officer
is
not
--
is
not
accurate.
actually,
i've
been
informed
by
the
state
department
that
the
--
the
waiting
list
on
the
turkish
quota
is
until
1965.
and
apart
from
that
i
see
the
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
when
the
court
recessed,
i
was
--
quote
a
situation
i
should
like
to
finish
with
that
before
proceeding.
the
mere
fact
that
a
given
quota
is
mortgaged
up
to
50%,
up
until
a
year
in
the
distant
future,
does
not
mean
that
suspensions
which
are
now
granted
are
charged
up
until
the
last
year.
we've
consulted
with
the
state
department
and
find
that
it
is
the
current
quota
which
would
be
charged
if
suspension
were
to
be
granted
in
these
cases.
in
other
words,
the
--
the
russian
quota
would
be
charged
with
the
female
petitioner's
number
and
the
turkish
quota
with
the
male
petitioner's
number,
so
that
aliens
who
have
been
waiting
for
a
long
time
on
those
quota
lists
would
be
prejudiced.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
that's
right.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
that's
right
sir.
and
of
course
that
50%
of
the
quota
has
already
been
mortgaged,
so
that
there
are
only
available
one-half
of
that
600
odd
and
some
of
those
are
taken
up
already
by
preferences.
i
won't
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
well,
there
have
been
certain
provisions
of
law.
for
example,
the
displaced
persons
act
of
1948
which
authorized
the
issuance
of
visas
in
fairly
large
numbers
to
nationals
of
countries
with
relatively
small
quotas
and
has
permitted
the
issuance
of
these
visas
notwithstanding
that
this
would
exhaust
the
quotas
but
stipulated
that
not
more
than
50%
of
the
quota
for
any
one
year
should
be
exhausted.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
and
in
--
in
administering
these
provisions,
the
state
department
is
careful
not
to
charge
all
suspensions
up
to
the
remaining
few
quota
numbers
available
because
that
would
mean
that
no
quota
immigrant
could
get
into
the
united
states.
one
thing
further
before
i
proceed
and
that
is
the
--
the
standard
of
review
available
in
cases
like
this
i
don't
believe
it
is
correct
to
say
that
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
must
justify
its
denial
of
discretion
to
the
satisfaction
of
a
reviewing
court.
i
believe
the
standard
which
has
been
laid
down
by
the
courts
and
which
has
been
followed
is
that
which
judge
learned
hand
stated
in
the
second
circuit
in
the
case
of
kaloudis
versus
shaughnessy,
and
i'm
--
i'd
like
to
quote
just
one
brief
portion
from
that
opinion.
that
appears
in
the
government's
brief
at
page
19,
referring
to
the
suspension
power
and
you're
pointing
out
that
is
a
dispensary
power,
judge
hand
stated,
"it
is
a
matter
of
grace
over
which
courts
have
no
review,
unless
as
we
are
assuming,
it
affirmatively
appears
that
the
denial
has
been
actuated
by
considerations
that
congress
could
not
have
intended
to
make
relevant."
and
i
may
state
that
the
immigration
regulations
did
require
the
hearing
officer
to
state
in
his
opinion
of
the
--
or
to
discuss
in
his
opinion
the
reasons
for
granting
or
withholding
relief.
there
was
no
such
requirement
with
respect
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
and
in
many
instances,
the
board
simply
adopts
the
hearing
officer's
opinion
and
merely
has
a
one-sentence
affirmance.
and
if
the
board
does
not
state
a
reason
for
denying
suspension,
which
is
a
clearly
an
inappropriate
reason,
there
is
really
nothing
for
the
court
to
review.
now,
getting
back
to
the
reasons
stated
by
the
hearing
officer.
as
i
have
pointed
out
he
stated
that
it
was
the
fact
that
the
petitioners
had
arrived
within
the
year
and
that
they
had
no
close
family
ties.
and
that
to
grant
them
this
maximum
form
of
relief
would
deprive
aliens
abroad
who
had
been
waiting
for
a
long
time.
these
were
reasons
why
the
maximum
discretion
was
denied
them.
when
the
board
considered
the
case,
it
affirmed
on
substantially
the
same
reasons
which
it
stated
in
its
initial
opinion
in
march
of
1954.
it
adverted
to
the
fact
that
the
aliens
had
recently
arrived.
by
that
time
they
had
been
here
a
little
less
than
three
years,
instead
of
a
little
less
than
one
year
and
the
board
adverted
--
adverted
to
the
fact
that
they
had
arrived
as
seamen.
but
in
essence
it
was
affirming
the
hearing
officer's
decision.
when
counsel
moved
to
reopen
and
to
reconsider,
the
board
denied
that
motion
on
what
seemed
to
be
very
substantial
reasons.
it
pointed
out
in
its
opinion
on
reconsideration
that
it
had
previously
denied
suspension
as
a
matter
of
discretion.
it
pointed
out
that
it
had
found
the
aliens
eligible
for
suspension
under
the
1917
act
standards.
but
that
in
the
exercise
of
discretion
it
had
not
considered
them
worthy
of
this
form
of
relief.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
that
is
in
the
board's
opinion,
which
appears
in
the
record
at
page
15,
i
believe.
at
the
top
of
the
page,
near
the
bottom
of
the
paragraph
it
says,
"after
considering,
on
march
18,
1954,
we
dismissed
the
appeal
from
the
hearing
officer's
decision
granting
voluntary
departure
and
denying
suspension
of
deportation.
after
considering
all
the
facts
in
the
case
at
that
time,
we
denied
suspension
of
deportation
as
a
matter
of
administrative
discretion."
and
then
in
the
next
paragraph
the
board
referred
to
the
fact
that
they
had
indicated
in
their
previous
order
that
the
aliens
had
established
eligibility
under
the
1917
act.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
in
the
very
last
paragraph
on
page
16."
upon
our
further
review
of
the
case
of
the
two
respondents,
we
adhere
to
our
previous
decision
that
suspension
of
deportation
should
be
denied
as
a
matter
of
administrative
discretion."
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
well,
that
--
that
i
believe
is
implicit
here.
that
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
oh,
i
--
i
don't
mean
that
they
explicitly
stated
that
we
find
anything
wrong
with
these
petitioners.
that
is
not
so.
the
board
found
that
they
were
persons
of
good
moral
character,
else
it
could
not
have
found
that
they
had
established
the
eligibility
under
the
1917
act.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
and
in
denying
this
motion
to
reopen,
the
board
set
forth
a
very
valid
reason
for
so
doing
and
that
appears
right
here
on
page
15.
counsel's
motion
sets
forth
no
matters
of
which
we
were
unaware
at
the
time
our
previous
decision
was
rendered.
so
that
it
cannot
be
said
that
the
board's
decision,
denying
reopening
was
arbitrary.
what
petitioner
points
to,
is
the
next
sentence
in
which
reference
was
made
to
the
1952
act.
and
as
i
should
like
to
point
out
at
a
later
part
of
my
argument,
i
believe
that
that
did
not
alter
the
judgment
of
the
board.
now,
the
facts,
the
factors
upon
which
the
hearing
officer
and
the
board
relied
in
denying
discretion
were
the
same
types
of
elements
which
the
board
had
previously
taken
into
consideration
in
other
cases,
since
the
1940
amendment
put
this
discretionary
power
into
the
hands
of
the
attorney
general.
and
these
were
the
very
same
elements
which
were
vigorously
debated
when
the
1940
amendment
was
considered
in
this
connect
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
of
the
record?
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i
--
i
think
that
that
is
about
the
only
reason.
there
was
something
on
page
8,
somewhere
toward
the
middle
where
the
reference
is
made
to
the
fact
that
the
female
petitioner's
testimony
regarding
her
intention
at
the
time
of
her
admission
was
somewhat
evasive
and
contradictory.
but
i
don't
think
that
that
was
necessarily
the
reason
it
was
denied.
i
think
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
that's
right.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i
--
i
think
you're
correct
in
that,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
surely.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
no,
i
think
that
that
sums
it
up.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i
believe
that
these
were
reasons
of
the
kind
that
congress
took
into
account
when
it
first
enacted
this
legislation.
if
i
may
develop
that,
the
immigration
act
of
1917
and
the
immigration
act
of
1924,
which
were
both
effective
at
the
same
time
were
inflexible.
for
the
most
part
they
required
deportation
of
all
aliens
who
fell
within
the
classification
stated.
and
after
they
had
been
in
operation
for
a
while
it
was
apparent
that
this
very
inflexibility
resulted
in
extreme
hardship
in
many
instances.
for
example,
there
was
no
statute
of
limitations
in
the
1924
act
with
respect
to
aliens
who
entered
illegally.
so
that
as
happened
very
frequently,
an
alien
who
had
entered
unlawfully
after
july
1st,
1924
and
who
have
might
thought
that
his
entry
was
perfectly
lawful,
and
who
remained
here
for
many
years,
had
married
an
american
citizen,
and
raised
an
american
family,
and
had
established
deep
roots
in
this
country
when
he
came
to
apply
for
naturalizations
some
years
later,
might
find
that
the
examiner
delved
into
his
initial
arrival
and
found
that
to
be
unlawful
and
deportation
proceedings
were
instituted.
and
the
secretary
of
labor
who
then
administered
the
immigration
laws,
had
absolutely
no
discretion,
had
no
alternative
but
to
deport.
that
in
fact
one
of
the
items
which
was
mentioned
in
the
congressional
debates
was
that
with
respect
to
criminals,
aliens
who
were
deportable
as
criminals,
they
could
be
relieved
from
deportation
because
either
they
could
get
a
pardon
or
if
the
sentencing
court
recommended
against
deportation
that
was
effective.
but
aliens
who
were
deportable
on
technical
grounds
and
who
had
been
here
for
many,
many
years,
and
had
roots
here
could
not
be
relieved
against.
and
throughout
the
debates
runs
this
common
thread,
that
here
are
aliens
who
are
deportable
on
technical
grounds,
who
have
been
here
for
many,
many
years,
and
whom
we
are
powerless
to
help.
the
commissioner
of
immigration,
while
various
bills
to
alleviate
this
situation
were
pending,
was
requested
by
joint
resolution
to
stay
deportation
in
cases
which
could
be
helped
by
this
type
of
legislation.
and
there
were
some
2800
cases
in
which
he
stayed
the
deportation
from
congress
to
congress,
while
--
while
alleviatory
measures
were
being
considered.
in
his
report
to
the
congress,
he
pointed
out
that
some
59%
of
these
aliens
had
been
in
the
country
for
more
than
10
years
and
i
believe
some
37%
had
been
here
more
than
five
years.so
that
throughout
the
consideration
by
congress
was
the
fact
that
there
were
aliens
who
had
been
here
for
a
long
time,
and
who
had
married
american
citizens,
and
who
had
begotten
american
citizen
children.
and
there
would
be
extreme
hardship
in
having
these
people
deported,
especially
on
the
narrow
and
technical
grounds
specified
in
the
immigration
act
of
1924
because
there
was
no
statute
of
limitations.
and
the
congress
for
a
long
time
was
loath
to
grant
this
discretionary
power
to
the
secretary
of
labor,
even
with
respect
to
these
aliens
of
long
residence
here
because
they
were
a
little
afraid
that
this
might
act
as
an
incentive
to
other
aliens
abroad
to
try
to
get
in
here
illegally
likewise.
that's
merely
one
of
the
elements
that
was
mentioned.
but
when
the
suspension
legislation
made
it's
way
into
the
alien
registration
act
of
1940,
the
board
was
entitled
to
take
into
account
the
question
of
recency
of
arrival
and
it
did
not
necessarily
restrict
its
decision
to
aliens
who
had
been
here
for
a
long
time,
but
that
was
one
of
the
elements
which
they
could
consider
and
did
consider.
and
the
decisions
of
the
board,
some
of
which
made
their
way
into
the
courts
on
habeas
corpus
indicate
that
this
was
one
of
the
factors.
now,
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
in
this
case,
congress
did
specify
the
standards
of
eligibility
in
the
1940
act.
those
were
rules
of
exclusion.
unless
the
alien
could
bring
himself
within
the
eligible
class,
the
attorney
general,
who
by
this
time
had
succeeded
to
the
secretary
of
labor's
responsibility,
had
no
power
to
suspend.
but
if
the
alien
did
bring
himself
within
the
eligible
classes,
this
did
not
mean
that
the
attorney
general
was
required
to
suspend
deportation.
then
it
was
left
up
to
the
attorney
general
in
his
informed
discretion
to
determine
whether
it
should
be
favorably
exercised
and
if
it
should
be
to
what
extent,
because
the
1940
act
provided
two
forms
of
relief.
first,
the
lesser
form
of
voluntary
departure
which
had
certain
distinct
advantages
and
then
the
maximum
relief
of
suspension.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
yes,
sir.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
that
is
right,
it
--
it
set
up
as
the
minimum
requirements
that
there
must
be
a
good
moral
character
for
five
years
and
that
there
must
be
a
serious
economic
detriment
to
a
citizen
or
legally-resident
child,
parent
or
spouse.
but
these
were
the
minimum.
unless
this
was
shown
the
attorney
general
had
no
power
and
it
did
not
follow
that
if
these
were
shown
then
the
attorney
general
must
suspend.
and
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
that
--
that
is
our
view
and
i
believe
we
are
borne
out
in
that
by
the
very
terminology
of
the
statute,
which
appears
in
full,
in
the
government's
brief
at
pages
2
to
4.
the
excerpt
from
this
section
which
appeared
in
the
respondent's
brief
did
not
contain
the
entire
act
and
i
should
like
to
point
this
out
at
page
2,
moving
about
six
lines
down
from
the
opening
of
the
quoted
matter.
it
says,
"the
attorney
general
may
permit
the
alien
to
depart
or
suspend
deportation."
and
in
the
rest
of
that
very
section,
the
word
shall
is
used
on
seven
different
occasions.
for
example,
if
the
attorney
general,
and
i'm
now
referring
to
page
3
of
our
brief,
if
the
attorney
general
suspends
deportation
for
more
than
six
months
then
the
statute
says
that
a
detailed
statement
of
the
facts
and
pertinent
provisions
of
law
in
the
case
shall
be
reported
to
congress.
and
if
during
the
session
of
congress
or
the
next
congress
passes
a
concurrent
resolution,
favoring
the
suspension,
then
the
attorney
general
shall
cancel
deportation
proceedings.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
the
statute
set
up
no
standard,
neither
the
1917
act
nor
the
1952
act
for
that
matter,
set
up
any
yard
stick
to
bind
the
attorney
general
in
exercising
his
discretion.
that
was
left
to
his
informed
discretion
and
i
believe
properly
so
because
the
attorney
general
was
chargeable
not
only
with
granting
suspension.
he
was
chargeable
with
the
overall
administration
of
the
immigration
laws.
and
there
were
many,
many
factors
which
he
could
and
should
take
into
account
in
weighing
discretion.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
for
example,
the
recency
of
the
arrival,
i
believe,
is
a
factor
to
be
taken
into
account.
the
fact
that
the
petitioners
arrived
as
seamen,
seamen
as
your
honor
understands,
are
granted
certain
privileges
under
the
immigration
laws.
in
order
to
keep
commerce
flowing,
they
are
readily
granted
shore
leave
at
being
contemplated
that
they
will
depart
with
their
vessels.
but
the
seamen
route
provides
a
very
easy
route
for
aliens
to
enter
the
united
states
very
readily
and
then
stay
here
if
they
are
not
acting
in
good
faith.
and
it's
quite
a
problem
in
the
administration
of
the
immigration
laws
to
--
to
avoid
affording
incentives
for
seamen
to
stay
here
and
remain.
the
acquisition
of
dependence
very
recently
has
been
one
basis
on
which
the
attorney
general
has
denied
suspension
in
some
cases
even
though
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
it
was
--
well,
the
--
the
female
petitioner
arrived
in
july.
the
child
was
born
in
november.
that's
five
months
later
i
believe.
and
the
--
the
male
petitioner
arrived
in
august
on
his
last
trip.
so,
i
think
that's
four
months.
at
any
rate
it
was
a
matter
of
a
few
months
after
they
had
arrived.
so,
that
is
one
of
the
factors.
i
should
also
like
to
point
out
that
the
factors
upon
which
the
attorney
general's
discretion
must
be
based
vary
from
time
to
time
and
the
attorney
general
cannot
act
in
a
vacuum.
he
cannot
--
it
cannot
be
expected
to
limit
himself
to
those
elements
which
were
operative
in
1940
when
this
legislation
was
enacted
because
much
history
has
been
written
since
1940.
we've
had
the
war
and
--
and
there
were
situations
engendered
by
the
war,
which
required
the
attorney
general
in
the
exercise
of
his
sound
discretion
to
tighten
up
in
certain
classes
of
cases.
and
in
the
aftermath
of
the
war,
there
were
situations,
the
stowaway
situation
immediately
after
the
close
of
world
war
ii.
we
got
a
--
a
situation
which
was
intolerable
and
would
have
lead
to
the
breakdown
of
--
of
the
immigration
law
as
if
we
permitted
it
to
continue.
so
that
these
are
all
factors
which
must
be
weighed
and
since
the
attorney
general
has
the
closest
touch
with
the
overall
situation,
congress
left
that
it
to
his
informed
discretion
to
determine
under
what
circumstances
this
maximum
form
of
relief
should
be
granted.
and
as
i
stated
the
courts
have
held
that
this
power
is
a
dispensary
power.
last
year,
this
court,
likened
it
did
to
the
power
of
the
president
in
granting
a
pardon
or
the
power
of
the
parole
board
in
granting
parole.
and
in
reviewing
the
exercise
of
discretion,
the
court
has
not
set
aside
the
administrative
determination.unless,
as
judge
learned
hand
pointed
out,
it
affirmatively
--
affirmatively
appears
that
it
was
actuated
by
considerations
that
congress
could
not
have
intended
to
make
relevant.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
that
--
that
is
our
view.
and
i
also
suggest
that
every
one
of
these
considerations
is
geared
not
only
to
the
background
of
the
1940
legislation,
but
is
consonant
with
the
practices
under
the
1940
act.
and
as
the
board
pointed
out
in
its
motion
and
its
decision
on
the
motion
on
reconsideration,
it
is
also
consonant
with
what
the
congress
referred
to
in
the
1952
act.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
in
this
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
in
this
case
both
petitioners
are
violators
of
the
immigration
laws.
they
are
deportable.
that
is
conceded.
in
the
absence
of
the
exercise
of
discretion
in
their
favor,
the
law
requires
them
to
be
deported.
so
they
come
here
or
i
should
say
they
come
to
the
attorney
general
and
they
say
they
have
met
the
standards.
they
are
within
the
class
to
whom
he
may
grant
suspension
of
deportation.
but
it
is
a
matter
of
grace.
he
need
not
and
if
he
feels
that
the
circumstances
are
such
that
he
should
not,
he
will
not.
i
--
i
believe
that
that
analogy
is
a
complete
one.
it
--
it
accords
with
what
this
court
said
last
year
in
the
jay
case
and
with
what
the
other
courts
have
said
judge
learned
hand
in
the
kaloudis
case
and
judge
frank
in
the
adel
case.
so
far
as
i
know
there
has
never
been
a
decision
which
has
held
that
this
is
not
a
discretionary
grant.
the
cases
have
been
--
have
been
uniform
in
the
17
years
that
this
section
has
been
before
the
courts.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
there
have
been
a
couple.
for
one
thing,
this
court
in
the
accardi
case,
the
first
accardi
case
held
that
when
the
board
exercises
discretion,
it
must
exercise
its
own
discretion.
it
cannot
be
dictated
to
by
the
attorney
general.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
and
on
the
second
go
around
in
that
case
it
was
found
that
there
had
been
no
such
dictation.
other
courts
have
held
--
in
fact
this
court
in
the
christensen
case,
some
years
back,
held
that
the
court
cannot
deny
discretion
on
an
improper
basis
of
ineligibility.
in
the
christensen
case,
the
board
had
found
the
--
the
petitioner
was
ineligible
to
the
benefits.
so,
strictly
speaking
that
wasn't
merely
a
matter
of
discretion.
it
was
a
matter
of
eligibility
but
it
adds
up
to
the
same
thing
because
when
the
court
--
when
the
board
withholds
its
discretion
on
a
theory
that
it
has
no
discretion
because
of
ineligibility,
the
court
has
said
that
that
is
improper.
there
has
been
another
case,
which
counsel
referred
to
in
the
second
circuit,
the
mastrapasqua
case,
in
which
the
court
had
held
that
when
the
board
in
classifying
aliens
and
in
determining
aliens
in
various
categories,
who
should
not
be
granted
this
relief,
hits
upon
a
classification
which
bears
no
reasonable
relationship
to
what
congress
intended.
that
is
arbitrary
and
that
in
effect
the
board
fails
to
exercise
its
discretion.
but
apart
from
this,
there've
been
any
number
of
decisions
where
the
courts
have
stated,
these
are
matters
of
administrative
discretion
on
which
we
shall
not
intervene.
and
in
fact,
some
courts
have
suggested
that
--
that
this
type
of
discretion
is
within
the
second
exception
to
the
opening
sentence
of
section
10
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
and
which
states
that
except
insofar
as
agency
review
is
limited
to
agency
discretion
or
--
or
words
to
that
effect,
there
shall
be
judicial
review.
the
ninth
circuit
has
held
to
that
effect.
i
know
of
no
decision
which
has
stated
that
the
board
must
justify
its
exercise.
actually,
it
has
been
the
reverse
that
the
courts
will
not
interfere,
unless
it
affirmatively
appears
that
the
board
has
acted
upon
considerations
which
congress
never
intended
to
apply.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
right.
that
--
that
is
so.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
exactly.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
exactly,
your
honor.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
on
that
basis
that
this
court
in
the
first
accardi
case
rejected
the
argument,
that
merely
because
the
board
had
granted
suspension
in
cases
which
were
factually
similar,
it
abused
this
discretion
in
not
granting
suspension
to
accardi.
this
court
held
that
that
argument
was
frivolous
and
was
properly
disposed
and
as
such
by
the
second
circuit
because
each
case
must
be
determined
on
its
own
base.
and
while
there
maybe
similarities
from
case
to
case,
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out,
each
case
must
be
considered
as
an
entity
in
itself.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
as
a
seaman,
sir.
she
was
a
seaman?
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
yes,
sir.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
it
--
it
may
seem
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
no,
according
to
her
testimony
and
we
have
no
reason
to
doubt
it,
the
--
the
petitioner
was
a
seaman
of
longstanding,
i
think
about
15
years.
and
he
met
the
--
and
that
is
the
male
petitioner
who
was
a
seaman.
and
he
met
the
female
petitioner
and
wanted
to
marry
her
but
his
vessel
was
not
going
to
touch
at
greece
for
sometime,
so
she
arranged
to
meet
him
in
north
africa
and
he
put
her
on
as
a
seaman.
he
was
the
chief
steward
i
believe
and
he
put
her
on
as
an
assistant
steward.
and
she
had
made
a
few
trips
before
this
last
entry
on
which
she
stayed.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i
can
only
infer
that
the
hearing
officer
felt
that
there
might
be
a
slight
element
of
bad
faith
here.
there
have
been
cases
in
which
the
board
has
denied
discretion
where
an
alien
sought
to
gain
time
until
he
could
possibly
qualify
for
eligibility.
part
of
the
statute,
for
example,
confers
eligibility
on
the
basis
of
seven
years
residence,
and
where
aliens
who
have
been
here
less
than
seven
years
have
contrived
somehow
by
dilatory
tactics
or
by
evasion
to
muster
that
up
seven
years.
the
board
has
taken
that
into
account.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
that's
right.
and
they
couldn't
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
they
might
have.
of
course,
that
--
that's
conjecture.
if
--
if
the
female
petitioner
had
told
the
--
the
immigrant
inspector
who
examined
her
that
she
was
pregnant
and
that
she
intended
to
remain
here
until
her
child
was
born,
it's
quite
possible
you
might
not
--
not
have
found
to
her
to
be
eligible
for
admission
as
a
seaman.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
--
while
--
while
for
quota
purposes
they
are
chargeable
to
the
countries
of
birth
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
they
go
to
the
country
of
nationality.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
well,
i
think
your
honor
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i
--
i
think
that
in
this
case
the
immigration
service
has
passports
for
both
petitioners.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
so
that
that
is
not
a
question
in
this
case.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
yes,
sir.
the
concurrent
resolution
must
be
passed
either
at
the
session
at
which
a
report
is
made
or
at
the
next
session.
and
the
act
specifies
that
if
by
the
close
of
the
next
session
such
a
concurrent
resolution
has
not
been
passed,
the
attorney
general
shall
proceed
with
deportation.
so
that
it
is
congress
which
has
the
last
word
and
it
would
be
very
odd
if
congress
should
have
intended
that
the
attorney
general
could
take
into
consideration
various
factors
in
weighing
his
discretion,
but
should
be
precluded
from
taking
into
account
the
views
of
congress.
we
feel
that
--
that
the
attorney
general
acted
properly.
the
attorney
general
acting
through
its
board,
acted
properly
if
it
took
into
account
the
current
policy
of
the
congress,
but
we
feel
that
when
read
in
context,
this
one
sentence
in
the
board's
opinion
on
reopening,
does
not
detract
from
the
fact
that
the
board
exercised
its
discretion
completely
in
consonance
with
the
theory
of
the
1940
act.
and
that
its
reference
to
the
1952
act
was
merely,
one
might
say
a
makeweight,
another
reason
for
saying
this
is
not
a
case
to
reopen.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
the
1952
act
simply
narrowed
the
range
of
discretion
by
setting
up
more
rigorous
standards
of
eligibility.
for
example,
these
petitioners
could
not
qualify
for
suspension
under
the
1952
act,
because
the
1952
act
require
10
years
of
continuous
presence
in
the
united
states.
they
didn't
have
it.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
right.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
right.
except
to
the
extent
that
in
--
in
enlarging
the
ineligible
classes,
the
1952
act
cut
down
on
the
cases
in
which
the
attorney
general
could
exercise
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
no,
no,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
1952
act
set
up
no
yardstick
to
govern
the
attorney
general
in
exercising
his
discretion.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
not
at
all,
not
at
all.
we
believe
that
that
discretion
is
discretion
and
that
the
attorney
general
is
entitled
to
weigh
the
relevant
factors.
and
in
fact,
there
--
there
has
been
a
succession
of
the
attorney's
general
since
the
1940
act
was
put
on
the
books.
and
some
they
have
felt
that
their
predecessors
were
a
--
a
little
too
lenient
or
perhaps
a
little
too
restrictive
in
their
grant
of
discretion.
but
that
was
a
matter
--
that
was
within
their
compass
and
in
fact
we
had
a
change
of
administration
since
the
1952
act
went
into
effect.
but
these
--
these
are
--
are
matters
which
are
within
the
--
the
field
of
expertise,
which
congress
has
left
to
the
administrative
authorities
who
are
best
qualified
to
make
judgments
in
this
field.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i
have
the
figures
for
the
last
few
years,
your
honor.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
yes,
sir.
and
i
may
say
this,
that
they
demonstrate
that
since
the
1952
act
with
its
more
restrictive
standards,
there's
been
a
marked
(inaudible)
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
30,
1956,
1021
cases
were
submitted
to
congress
and
congress
approved
1088.
you
may
note
that
congress
approved
more
than
were
submitted
but
that's
because
they
are
--
there
are
backlogs
carrying
over
from
one
session
to
the
next.
in
the
year
1955,
1089
were
submitted
by
the
immigration
service
and
1937
were
approved
by
congress.
in
the
year
1954,
2241
were
submitted
by
the
immigration
service
and
6035
were
approved
by
congress.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i
don't
know
whether
those
statistics
are
maintained.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
there
--
there
are
denials
as
this
case
demonstrates.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i
--
i
shall
be
very
happy
to
make
inquiry
--
but
if
isn't
--
it
isn't
worthwhile
to
make
any
extent
here
to
put
any
load,
heavy
load,
but
if
they're
just
ready
all
you
can
do
is
to
take
them
off
from
some
sheet
then
i
would
like
to
see
them.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
well,
that
--
that
is
where
these
figures
were
obtained
from
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i'll
--
i'll
try
to
supply
the
court
with
that.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
no,
the
denials
are
not
required
to
be
reported.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
right
in
the
initial
statute
in
1940.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
that's
right.
in
fact,
the
--
the
debates
on
the
1940
measure,
that
is
in
the
background
of
the
1940
act,
indicated
clearly
that
the
congress
didn't
want
to
leave
the
ultimate
discretion
to
the
--
to
the
secretary
of
labor
at
that
time.
they
wanted
to
reserve
to
themselves
the
power
to
have
the
final
say.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
yes,
sir.
as
--
as
a
matter
fact,
one
of
the
board
decisions
points
out
that
the
81st
congress,
within
a
period
of
several
months,
had
turned
down
37
cases,
all
involving
the
same
pattern,
that
is
aliens
from
contiguous
territory
who
would
come
here
and
then
--
who
would
come
here
recently.
and
then
had
had
a
child
born
here
and
applied
for
suspension
on
the
basis
of
that
birth.
and
incidentally,
the
attorney
general
had
suspended
deportation
on
those
cases
and
congress
had
turned
every
one
of
them
down.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
yes,
sir.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i
believe
that
was
in
the
81st
congress.
i
believe
--
i
--
i
have
a
reference
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
--
to
the
case.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
it
was
--
it
was
before
the
1952
act.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
it
--
it's
possible
that
congress
--
congress
there
has
not
hesitated
to
--
to
turn
down
cases
were
it
felt
that
the
attorney
general
has
perhaps
been
a
little
too
lenient.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
that's
right.
i
must
say
in
all
fairness
that
--
that
there
were
other
factors.
that
was
merely
one
of
the
factors
involved
in
these
cases.
they
were
--
they
were
aliens
from
contiguous
territory.
i
assume
mexicans
and
they
had
come
here
with
large
families,
and
they
applied
for
a
suspension
of
deportation
because
of
the
fact
that
after
arriving
here
they
had
had
a
child
born
here.
and
on
the
basis
of
that
child
being
an
american
citizen,
the
--
the
attorney
general
or
that
his
delegate,
the
board,
had
suspended
deportation.
and
congress
had
in
37
cases,
following
the
same
pattern
simply
refused
to
go
along.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
a
very
sharp
eye.
we
submit
that
in
this
case
the
record
makes
it
clear
that
the
board
did
not
fail
to
exercise
its
discretion.
that
in
exercising
its
discretion
it
did
not
act
arbitrarily
and
that
in
--
in
weighing
the
factors,
which
go
to
make
up
discretion,
it
did
not
take
into
account
anything
that
it
should
not
have.
we
believe
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
