and
what
i
was
getting
at
the

his
dissent

that
he
interpreted
what

that

well,
that's
a
different
thing
from
saying
that
if
the
board
did
not
consider
that
it
was
restricted,
that
it
could

all
the

did

we
reviewed

then
you
have
to
shift
your
ground
somewhat
because
it

your
position
then
would
be
not
that
he
gave
no
reasons

that
the
reasons
that
he
gave
were
inadequate

they
should
