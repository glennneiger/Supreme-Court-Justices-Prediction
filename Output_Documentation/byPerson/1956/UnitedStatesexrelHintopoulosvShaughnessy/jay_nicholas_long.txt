mr.
jay
nicholas
long
mr.
chief
--
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
--
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
it
involves
two
greek
citizens.
both
of
whom
were
regularly
engaged
in
the
seafaring
occupations
aboard
the
same
vessel,
following
their
marriage
in
the
late
1950.
the
petitioner
wife
about
seven
months
after
her
marriage
and
after
several
arrivals
in
the
united
states
found
herself
expecting
their
first
child
and
came
ashore
for
a
medical
checkup.
during
which
time
the
doctor
has
indicated
to
her
that
she
should
stop
travelling
because
it
would
jeopardize
the
well-being
of
the
unborn
child.
the
husband,
nevertheless,
continued
sailing
and
only
when
the
ship
was
again
ashore
did
he
stay
ashore
and
for
pleading
of
his
wife
until
such
time
as
the
child
should
be
born,
going
to
the
fact
to
the
wife
was
completely
alone
here.
now,
the
petitioner
wife
gave
birth
to
their
american
citizen
child
in
november
1951
and
in
january
1952,
in
accordance
with
the
then
prevailing
law,
both
petitioners
applied
for
privilege
of
suspension
of
deportation
in
order
to
prevent
serious
economic
detriment
of
their
american
citizen
child
pursuant
to
the
immigration
act
of
1917
as
amended,
which
provision
of
law
had
been
enacted
by
a
modification
law
in
1940,
not
for
the
purpose
of
giving
special
benefits
to
illegal
aliens
but
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
interests
of
american
citizens
or
legal
american
residents
who
were
dependent
upon
these
illegal
aliens.
i
am
anxious
to
make
that
distinction
because
of
the
subsequent
events
that
come
about
with
the
new
act
of
1952.
now,
following
their
application
for
this
change
of
status
in
january
of
1952,
they
were
accorded
a
hearing
in
may
1952.
at
which
time,
the
immigration
hearing
officer
found
both
petitioners
fully
qualified
for
this
relief
they
requested,
that
is
suspension
of
deportation.
but
he
decided
that
he
would
not
give
them
this
privilege
despite
the
fact
they
were
fully
eligible
for
him
in
his
own
words
because
of
the
fact
that
he
felt
there
was
too
great
a
reward
to
accord
them
because
of
the
accidental
birth
of
their
infant
child
in
this
country.
despite
the
fact,
as
i
pointed
out
before
that
the
whole
purpose
of
the
act
of
1917
as
amended,
section
19
(c)
is
to
protect
this
very
american
citizen
child.
the
counsel
at
that
time
took
a
--
that
appeal
from
the
adverse
decision
of
the
hearing
officer,
and
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
did
not
act
on
this
appeal
until
march
1954.
now,
of
course
in
the
mean
time,
the
immigration
act
of
1952
had
been
enacted
on
june
27th,
1952,
it
went
into
effect
on
december
24,
1952.
and
in
march
1954,
when
the
board
handed
down
its
decision
on
the
appeal,
it
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
hearing
officer,
it
agreed
that
the
aliens
were
qualified
for
suspension
of
deportation
but
again
denied
them
that
privilege
without
really
indicating
any
proper
reason
for
it.
whereas
i
submit
that
under
the
act
of
1917
as
amended
and
by
a
great
number
of
decisions
here
in
the
court
handed
down
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
itself,
they
are
supposed
to
ascribe
proper
reasons
for
denying
or
granting
this
discretionary
relief.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
have
highlighted
a
case
of
judge
bandy
that
came
down
on
december
24th,
1952.
specifically,
because
the
fact
that
he
went
to
great
pains
to
show
the
exact
procedure
that
was
then
applicable
in
a
case
such
as
the
one
that
needs
to
be
reported
toward
at
this
thing.
following
to
this
adverse
decision
of
the
board,
i
came
into
the
case
in
the
spring
of
1954
and
i
made
a
motion
to
reopen.
and
at
that
time,
for
the
first
time,
the
board
in
considering
my
motion
to
reopen
indicated
that
it
have
also
taken
into
consideration
the
restrictive
evaluation
for
this
privilege
of
suspension
of
deportation
that
had
been
formulated
under
the
act
of
1952,
which
i
respectfully
submit
was
error
on
the
part
of
the
board.
and
i
say
that
because
the
act
of
1952
has
the
saving
clause
in
section
405,
which
expressly
states
that
the
act
1952
should
not
be
applicable
to
any
applications
for
the
privilege
of
suspension
of
deportation
that
were
pending
prior
to
june
27th,
1952,
when
the
act
of
1952
was
enacted.
and
it
was
on
that
basis
that
i
was
thereafter
forced
to
seek
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
district
court
of
new
york.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
and
--
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
no,
sir.
they
turned
it
down
after
the
act
of
1952
was
enacted.
despite
--
but
i
am
pointing
out
that
in
their
second
decision
in
response
to
my
motion
to
reopen,
that
for
the
first
time
indicated
that
they
were
taking
the
--
the
elements
and
evaluation
for
the
privilege
of
suspension
of
deportation
that
had
been
formulated
under
the
act
of
1952.
they
so
stated
in
their
--
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
the
first
time
they
turned
it
down
they
--
theoretically,
were
premising
it
on
the
rules
prevailing
under
the
act
of
1917.
but
in
that
case,
i
contend,
that
they
did
not
ascribe
any
reason
for
denying.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
that
was
in
march
1954.
as
i
have
pointed
out
that
they
left
at
quite
a
long
time
to
go
by,
during
which
time
of
course
the
act
of
1952
had
come
into
existence.
and
i
--
i
believe
that
there
--
there
was
unquestionably
even
in
march
1954,
the
new
rules
in
their
mind
when
they
affirmed
the
decision,
the
adverse
decision
of
april
1952
of
the
hearing
officer
in
new
york.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
no,
but
in
the
subsequent
decision
of
may
1954,
i
--
they
--
they
expressly
indicate
that
they
are
influenced
by
the
act
of
1952.
as
the
late
judge
frank
also
points
out
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
the
court
below.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
the
hearing
officer
first
denied
this
case
in
may
--
on
may
29th,
1952.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
it
was
supposed
to
be,
yes.
and
--
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
well,
if
you
should
agree
with
me
then
--
then
of
course
my
clients,
having
been
found
eligible
by
the
very
findings
of
the
hearing
officer
himself
for
the
privilege
of
suspension
of
deportation
under
the
act
of
1917.
they
would
then
of
course
have
the
case
remanded
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
for
a
finding
consistent
with
such
a
decision
on
the
part
of
this
court.
and
thereafter,
the
board
would
make
a
favorable
recommendation
to
congress
for
suspension
of
deportation
under
the
act
of
1917,
applicable
to
these
petitioners
and
the
congress
would
in
due
course
act
upon
that
recommendation.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
well,
i'll
come
to
that
later
in
my
brief,
mr.
--
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
--
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
i'm
anxious
to
make
that
distinction
because
of
my
learned
opponent
has
placed
a
lot
of
weight
on
the
jay
versus
boyd
decision
of
this
court.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
all
right.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
now,
i
respect
the
--
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
yes,
sir.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
well,
naturally,
if
the
1952
act
prevails
in
this
case
there
will
be
no
benefit
at
all
to
the
petitioners
because
of
the
additional
words
in
his
discretion.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
precisely,
your
honor.
yes.
and
that
is
the
exact
point
that
was
held
by
the
late
judge
frank
in
the
circuit
court
of
new
york.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
well,
now,
that's
a
--
that's
an
interesting
question,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
because
there
have
been
cases
that
i
have
cited
in
my
brief
here
which
point
out
that
if
the
alien
is
eligible
for
discretionary
relief
under
the
old
act,
a
denial
of
that
discretionary
relief
must
offer
justification.
otherwise,
of
course,
there
is
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
act
on
the
part
of
the
board
which
would
be
subject
to
an
appeal.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
yes,
congress
has
different
things
under
the
new
act
and
of
course
--
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
but
it
expressly
exempts
prior
cases
under
its
own
saving
clause.
that
is
precisely
my
point.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
under
the
old
law?
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
well,
as
i
have
pointed
out
here
--
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
i
think
there
--
there
is
a
constitutional
--
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
--
question
there.
yes,
sir.
when
the
district
court
handed
down
its
decision
in
1955,
the
district
judge
acknowledged
that
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
had
been
influenced
by
the
act
of
1952
and
took
the
position
that
the
attorney
general
could
take
into
account
the
new
standard
laid
down
by
congress.
this
is
precisely
the
error
of
law
on
which
i
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
thereafter
came
before
this
court
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
and
it
is
exactly
on
this
point
that
the
late
judge
frank
and
the
circuit
court
points
out
that
the
district
judge
in
recognizant
of
the
board
took
into
account
the
new
standard
laid
down
by
the
congress
in
the
act
of
1952,
was
actually
acting
improperly.
in
that,
he
failed
to
recognize
the
saving
clause
and
the
rights
preserved
to
the
petitioners
under
that
saving
clause.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
well,
as
a
matter
fact,
we
hardly
examined
a
rule
on
this
case
in
may
1952.
the
new
act
was
not
--
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
--
in
the
picture
at
all.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
the
board,
of
course,
did
not
--
was
not
suppose
to.
i
contend
was
not
suppose
to
take
into
consideration
the
new
standards
at
all.
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
in
may
1954,
in
response
to
my
motion
to
reopen
and
reargue
they
acknowledged
that
they
had
been
influenced
by
the
new
standards.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
well,
but
he
--
he
felt
that
the
board
had
--
had
made
an
error
by
virtue
of
allowing
the
new
law
to
restrict
the
birth
of
the
discussion
--
discretion
that
they
were
suppose
to
exercise.
and
therefore
that
it
was
an
illegal
act
from
their
part.
of
course
he
was
the
minority
opinion
and
the
majority
opinion
sustained
judge
dawson
of
the
district
court.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
well,
of
course,
if
the
board
had
never
--
never
gone
into
the
question
of
the
new
act
and
new
standards,
and
had
--
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
precisely.
yes.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
well,
i
don't
think
that
this
court
would
be
very
anxious
to
endorse
a
policy
like
that
either.
because
i
think
that
they
--
the
--
the
court
is
anxious
to
preserve
whatever
rights
these
petitioners
are
entitled
to.
and
that
was
the
whole
purpose
of
the
saving
clause.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
and
yes
--
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
and
is
--
and
is
also
bound
to
ascribe
proper
reasons
for
that
under
the
saving
clause.
now,
that's
--
that's
the
whole
point
of
--
that
judge
bandy
had
made
in
his
decision
that
i
have
cited
here.
that
in
proceeding
under
the
old
act,
there
were
certain
definite
rules
and
regulations
that
had
to
be
followed
by
the
hearing
officer
and
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
step
by
step.
if
they
granted
or
denied
a
discretionary
relief,
they
had
to
ascribe
reasons
for
it.
and
that
was
not
done
here
in
the
original
decision.
and
then
on
my
motion
to
reargue,
they
for
the
first
time
indicated
that
they
had
been
influenced
by
the
new
standards
of
the
act
of
1952,
which
i
contend
is
an
error
of
law
because
the
act
of
1952
had
no
application
here
by
virtue
of
its
own
saving
clause.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
well,
if
they
used
language
that
would
indicate
that
they
were
influenced
by
the
--
by
the
new
act
of
1952
--
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
yes.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
the
matter
first
came
into
the
picture
in
the
beginning
in
1952,
yes.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
yes,
i
would
--
i
would
take
that
position
because
i
would
--
i
would
contend
that
they
were
bound
since
they
found
the
persons
eligible
under
the
act
of
1917
to
either
--
to
--
to
grant
them
the
privilege
that
they
had
applied
for.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
no,
it's
not
automatic.
but
on
--
on
--
but
they
must
ascribe
reason
for
denying
it.
and
unless
that
reason
has
a
good
foundation,
such
as
a
political
antecedent
or
a
criminal
background,
something
like
that,
then
i
believe
the
courts
would
take
the
position
that
it
has
been
arbitrary
exercise
of
discretion
on
their
part,
but
it
is
quite
capricious.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
particular
--
particularly,
what
we
bare
in
mind
that
the
act
of
1917
is
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
american
citizen,
relative
of
these
aliens,
not
the
aliens
themselves.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
well,
the
whole
point
is
that
under
the
act
of
1952,
the
attorney
general
is
given
a
much
finer
line
of
delineation
in
--
in
exercising
the
privilege
of
suspension
of
deportation,
it's
strictly
in
his
discretion.
the
words
in
his
discretion
did
not
exist
before.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
is
the
point
made
by
this
court
in
--
in
analyzing
the
jay
versus
boyd
decision
when
it
handed
down
that
decision.
and
naturally,
under
the
act
of
1952
in
adding
those
three
words
in
his
discretion,
they
have
greatly
restricted
the
granting
of
this
privilege
and
have
made
it
a
much
more
difficult
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
--
to
accomplish.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
no,
sir.
on
page
--
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
on
page
14
--
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
on
page
14
of
my
brief,
sir.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
yes.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
no,
at
the
lower
part.
there
was
--
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
14,
sir.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
on
the
brief.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
they
have
--
but
that's
that,
mr.
justice.
the
board,
when
they
handed
down
their
second
decision
in
may
1954,
acknowledged
that
under
the
act
of
1952,
the
granting
of
suspension
of
deportation
was
dependent
on
a
more
severe
--
a
more
severe
acid
test
by
way
of
granting
--
part
of
a
personal
fault.
but
in
other
words,
it
became
not
a
matter
of
serious
economic
detriment
but
in
their
own
words
--
i'm
reading
it
from
page
12
of
the
argument
where
judge
dawson
says,
"the
bill
accordingly
established
the
policy
that
the
administrative
remedy
should
be
available
only
in
the
very
limited
category
of
cases
in
which
the
deportation
of
the
alien
would
be
unconscionable.
hardship
or
even
unusual
hardship
to
the
alien
or
to
his
spouse,
parent,
or
child
is
not
sufficient
to
justify
suspension
of
deportation.”
that
of
course
has
made
the
standard
for
granting
this
privilege
a
very
restrictive
one
and
something
very
difficult
to
accomplish
since
the
act
of
1952
came
into
effect.
and
on
the
other
hand,
under
the
act
of
1917,
if
the
aliens
were
found
eligible
by
virtue
of
good
moral
character
and
certain
other
rules
of
thumb
that
have
been
set
--
set
down
by
law
and
regulation.
then,
because
of
the
fact
that
it
was
the
intention
to
protect
the
american
citizen
dependent,
the
privilege
would
be
granted
to
the
alien
applying
for.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
yes,
sir.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
that
was
right,
sir.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
that
was
their
position.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
well,
as
i
interpret
the
decision
of
the
--
of
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals,
they
take
the
position
that
the
--
that
the
law
is
a
living
thing
that
is
constantly
subject
to
new
interpretations
and
new
analysis.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
yes,
sir.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
yes,
sir.
and
that
the
board
had
every
right
to
take
into
consideration
these
new
standards.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
not
as
standards
but
by
way
of
a
general
consideration
and
they
go
on
to
--
to
point
out
that
they
still
believe
that
the
board
did
not
actually
base
its
decision
on
that
but
on
the
old
act,
whereas
judge
frank
makes
a
distinction
that
how
can
they
possibly
have
taken
into
consideration
these
new
standards
when
they
had
no
business
to
do
so
by
virtue
of
the
saving
clause
of
the
act
of
1952.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
well,
of
course
--
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
that's
why
we're
before
this
court.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
that's
--
that's
a
little
bit
difficult
to
put
my
finger
on,
your
honor.
they
--
they
took
the
same
position.
judge
hincks
took
the
same
position
as
judge
dawson
that
the
board
could
recognize
the
new
standards
that
had
been
formulated
in
connection
with
the
act
of
1952
without
--
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
taking
them
into
account.
and
of
course
that's
the
--
that's
the
puzzler
that
has
caused
me,
of
course,
to
come
before
this
court
contending
that
there
is
an
error
of
law
there.
i
say
of
course
that
that
whole
--
that
--
that
any
consideration
whatsoever
of
the
new
act
or
of
the
discussions
leading
to
it
in
congress
have
absolutely
no
part
in
--
in
coming
--
coming
to
this
decision
by
virtue
of
the
saving
--
saving
clause
of
the
act
of
1952.
and
now,
as
i
see
it,
of
course,
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
took
approximately
a
year
and
a
half,
almost
two
years
to
come
to
its
original
decision
in
march
1954.
when
the
new
act
had
been
existence
for
the
better
part
of
two
years
and
--
and
they
were
bound
to
be
influenced
by
it,
and
of
course
we're
trying
to
avoid
any
admission
of
it.
it
was
only
when
i
moved
for
re-argument
that
i
saw
of
course
their
--
their
hand
and
they
came
out
and
admitted
it
in
their
new
decision
that
they
were
influenced
by
it.
and
i
contend
that
there
was
an
error
of
law
on
their
part.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
yes.
in
that
first
full
paragraph
on
page
15
of
the
record,
where
they
say
in
that
line
it
is
crystal
clear
that
congress
intended
to
greatly
restrict
the
granting
of
suspension
of
deportation.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
you
mean
what
it
says
in
both
cases,
the
decision
of
the
court?
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
that
--
that
i
--
i
consider
an
--
an
open
admission
on
their
part
that
they
--
that
they
themselves
have
denied
due
process
of
law
here
because
they're
acknowledging
that
the
respondents,
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
are
eligible
under
the
act
of
1917
and
therefore
should
have
been
granted
the
privilege
of
suspension
of
deportation.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
no.
no,
i
wouldn't
make
--
i
would
take
that
position
here,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
no,
sir.
because
under
the
act
of
1917
there
--
there
are
certain
--
certain
considerations
that
--
that
have
to
be
acknowledged.
now,
the
whole
point
is
that
if
the
exercising
of
discretion
under
the
old
act
does
not
set
forth
proper
reason,
then
of
course
you
have
the
question
of
arbitrary
and
capricious
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
board.
and
that
is
what
i
contend
here
because
having
found
the
alien,
the
petitioners
eligible
under
the
old
act,
if
they
denied
them
that
privilege
they
have
to
ascribe
proper
reason
for
it.
and
no
proper
reason
was
ascribed
when
the
hearing
officer
stated
that
they
can't
get
this
kind
of
a
privilege
just
because
of
the
accidental
birth
of
a
child
in
this
country.
the
whole
point
is
that
that
child
is
the
one
who
was
supposed
to
be
protected
under
the
act
of
1917.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
that
is
right.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
well,
i
would
say
yes.
i
would
--
i
would
say
yes
because
i
would
say
that
they
have
no
right
to
consider
the
--
the
new
act
of
congress
or
by
virtue
of
its
--
of
its
saving
clause
judgment.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
yes,
sir.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
well,
as
i
have
indicated
in
my
brief,
i
have
many
number
of
cases
cited
of
the
board
itself
that
shows
--
that
each
of
which
shows
that
in
granting
suspension
of
deportation,
time
after
time,
they
were
going
on
the
basis
of
protecting
the
american
citizen
or
legal
resident
alien
dependents
of
the
aliens.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
no,
they
don't
have
to.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
that
they
were
acting
on
arbitrary
and
capricious
manner.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
well,
that
their
--
their
complete
failure
on
their
part
to
--
to
exercise
proper
discretion.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
well,
of
course
i
came
into
the
picture
after
their
first
decision
--
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
--
and
i
contended,
of
course,
that
they
have
not
properly
exercised
their
discretionary
powers
after
having
found
both
petitioners
eligible
for
suspension
of
deportation.
and
therefore,
i
ask
for
reconsideration,
and
it
was
in
response
to
that
that
they
then
brought
in
the
new
standards.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
yes,
and
we're
strengthened
our
view
in
part
of
the
new
standard
which
--
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
--
of
course
i
say
was
entirely
improper
on
their
part.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
that's
right.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
well,
i
have
made
that
point
in
my
--
in
my
brief,
your
honor,
in
--
in
this
respect.
i
have
pointed
out
that
an
--
on
the
basis
of
their
original
decision,
not
having
ascribed
proper
reason
for
granting
the
discretionary
privilege
after
finding
them
eligible
for
it
that
there
was
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
act
on
their
--
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
--
part.
and
i
cite
several
--
several
court
decisions
that
are
strictly
on
that
point.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
yes,
sir.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
i
raised
the
question.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
i
have
to
go
back
a
little
on
my
whole
record
on
that,
your
honor.
but
as
i
recall
in
my
motion
for
reopening
and
reconsideration,
i
did
raise
the
question
of
the
new
standard
set
down
by
the
congress
by
way
of
pointing
out
the
distinction
and
the
importance
of
preserving
the
rights
of
the
petitioners
under
the
old
act
as
against
the
new
act.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
yes.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
no,
i
don't
believe
i
did
that,
your
honor.
well,
the
whole
point
is
that
the
original
decision
of
the
board
as
it
came
down
in
march
1954,
affirming
the
decision
of
the
hearing
officer,
acknowledged
that
these
people
were
eligible
for
suspension
of
deportation
but
denied
them
that
privilege
without
giving
them
any
proper
reason
for
it.
and
i
contend,
as
i
have
pointed
out
in
a
number
of
decisions
cited
in
my
brief,
that
they
were
bound
to
give
proper
reason
for
denying
this,
otherwise
they
were
acting
in
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
manner.
i
have
cited
--
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
yes.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
precisely.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
well,
of
course
i
contend
that
the
--
the
examiner's
reason
were
actually
a
hollow
thing,
a
shallow
thing
that
they
were
--
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
well
--
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
--
when
he
--
when
he
contended
that
--
that
the
--
it
was
an
abuse
to
the
detriment
of
people
waiting
in
long
--
in
long
lines
on
the
quota
lists.
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief,
when
it's
to
referring
to
quotas
that
are
oversubscribed
to
the
--
past
the
year
2000,
it's
a
--
it's
actually
a
sham
argument
on
the
part
of
the
hearing
officer.
particular
instance,
when
the
act
of
1917
was
amended
in
--
in
1940,
it
was
provided
that
under
these
circumstances
not
more
than
50%
of
the
annual
quota
of
these
countries
could
be
hypothecated
by
virtue
of
taking
away
numbers
for
people
to
whom
the
privilege
of
suspension
of
deportation
would
be
given.
and
when
you're
speaking
now
of
a
quota
for
a
country
that
is
oversubscribed
to
the
--
to
pass
the
year
2000,
it
becomes
a
--
a
completely
academic
argument
because
we
are
really
concerned
fundamentally
under
the
act
of
1917
with
preserving
the
right
of
the
american
citizen
dependent
of
the
alien
and
not
the
alien
himself.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
were
inadequate
--
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
precisely.
as
i
pointed
out
when
i
say
that
when
he
--
when
he
makes
a
statement
of
this
is
too
great
a
reward
to
give
these
aliens
by
virtue
of
the
accidental
birth
of
their
child
in
america.
i
think
that
he
is
--
is
acting
into
the
tongue-in-cheek
and
is
acting
in
a
very
arbitrary
manner
because
we're
not
concerned
about
that,
we're
concerned
about
that
very
american
child
that
was
born
here
or
be
(voice
overlap)
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
no,
but
as
the
courts
have
held
number
--
a
number
times,
mr.
justice,
if
--
if
they'd
rendered
denied
this
discretionary
privilege
under
the
old
act,
they
must
give
a
good
and
--
good
and
bonafide
reason.
otherwise,
there's
no
question
that
their
acting
in
a
capricious
manner.
there
you
have
that
as
recently
as
1915
in
the
mastrapasqua
case
which
i
have
cited.
but
in
1953,
you
have
the
(inaudible)
case
here
in
the
district
and
then
you
have
the
(inaudible)
case
in
the
district
as
well.
now,
all
of
these
have
taken
the
position
that
unless
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
gave
proper
reason
for
denying
or
granting
discretionary
relief,
there
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
on
their
--
on
their
part
which
would
be
subject
to
judicial
review.
mr.
jay
nicholas
long
i
just
like,
if
your
--
your
honor
please,
to
make
two
points
out.
first
of
all,
mr.
justice
brennan,
had
raised
the
question
as
to
the
factors
considered
by
the
board
in
granting
suspension
of
deportation
under
the
act
of
1917.
i'd
like
to
invite
attention
to
pages
15,
16
and
17
of
my
brief,
concerning
the
fact
as
that
--
that
they
have
taken
into
consideration
because
they
have
been
quite
flexible
on
--
on
that
including
granting
suspension
of
deportation
to
a
woman
who
being
here
as
a
visitor,
married
an
illegal
alien
one
month
after
she
was
here.
and
then
once
a
child
was
born
applied
for
suspension
of
deportation,
it
was
granted
her.
and
the
emphasis
there
by
the
board
was
on
the
fact
that
her
deportation
would
work
on
incredible
hardship
or
serious
detriment
to
the
child
if
its
parent
was
taken
or
was
sent
abroad.
that
is
just
one
case
that
i
think
is
--
is
more
of
an
emphatic
on
--
in
favor
of
the
petitioners
here.
and
mr.
justice
clark
concerning
the
question
raised
by
you
as
to
the
cases
turned
down
by
the
congress
had
been
recommended
by
the
attorney
general.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
immediately
before
the
enactment
of
the
--
the
act
in
1952,
the
judiciary
committees
of
both
houses
had
decided
to
put
a
clamp
on
the
thousands
of
cases
that
were
being
recommended
for
suspension
of
deportation
principally,
in
connection
with
aliens
who
had
been
caught
here
during
the
war
and
had
stayed
here
for
seven
years
or
more
and
hence,
were
eligible
for
suspension
of
deportation
under
the
amendment
of
the
act
of
1948,
which
said
that
aliens
here
for
seven
years
or
more
were
eligible
for
that
period.
and
that
congress
at
that
time
in
considering
the
act
of
1952
took
the
position
that
we
are
not
going
to
place
a
lot
of
load
or
reap
on
the
--
of
reward
of
all
these
thousands
of
aliens
who
had
successfully
evaded
our
laws
for
seven
years
or
more.
but,
of
course,
i
think
that
that
is
a
very
serious
distinction
from
cases
such
as
the
one
at
bar
where
the
welfare
of
an
american
citizen
was
the
principal
consideration.
but
the
truth
is
that
at
--
at
the
time
that
the
board
was
considering
this
case,
several
thousand
cases
had
been
rejected
by
the
congress.
and
thus
--
and
the
board
had
before
it
the
problem
of
trying
to
dispose
of
all
of
these
cases
administratively
by
way
of
having
thrown
back
in
their
lap
by
the
congress.
and
i'm
sure
that
was
a
very
important
consideration
for
the
board
at
the
time
that
it
considered
this
particular
case,
even
though
it
did
not
say
so
in
its
decision.
