may
i
ask
--
may
i
just
ask
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
your
argument
means
that
whatever
may
be
derived
--
that
nothing
may
be
derived
from
the
policy
governing
disposition
in
1952?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
talking
about
assuming
--
the
chief
justice's
question,
assuming
you
prevail
in
your
view,
does
that
mean
that
the
policy
that
it
--
that
1952
must
be
shut
out
of
the
consciousness
of
all
the
authorities?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
as
a
matter
of
construction,
isn't
it?
that
is
as
a
matter
of
construction
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
meant
is
that
congress
different
things
put
before?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
was
not
relating
to
prior
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
that's
your
argument?
what
i
want
to
know
is
that
whether
congress
would
have
to
--
is
there
--
are
there
constitutional
issues
lurking
which
will
lead
to
one
construction
or
rather
another?
that's
my
real
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
--
are
there
--
are
there
constitutional
question
which
would
have
to
be
based
at
the
construction
other
than
that
for
which
you
contend?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
to
argue
it.
i
just
want
to
know
whether
your
contention
is
that
this
raises
constitutional
question
and
therefore
the
statute
must
be
very
restrictively
--
therefore
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
the
board
had
out
of
its
own
thought,
of
its
own
imaginings,
i
don't
know
about
it,
its
own
imagination,
not
(inaudible)
at
large.
they
first
thought
about
these
things
and
--
and
put
in
the
reason
that
it
found
in
the
policy
of
the
1952
act.
it
says
nothing
about
that
act
or
any
either
of
you
please
know
such
as
act
had
--
had
been
passed,
would
you
fell
that
--
that
in
doing
so,
indulge
it
in
a
--
in
conduct
unrelated
to
the
deposit
of
this
question
given?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
assuming
there
was
no
such
act
in
existence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
they
--
but
they
thought
about
this
matter.
when
was
this
in
1952?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
this
kind
of
thing
was
in
the
area
before
and
that
they
put
it
on
paper
as
their
own
reasoning,
although
no
act
have
been
passed
or
is
even
in
the
legislative
mill,
would
you
have
said
that
that
consideration
travelled
so
far
out
of
bounds
or
what
was
relevant
to
the
exercise
of
discretion
that
the
court
would
have
to
strike
it
down
as
arbitrary?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
is
it
--
is
the
granting
of
the
privilege
automatic
if
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
agree
with
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
policy
that
they
have
derived
from
the
act
of
1952
which
they
then
thought
was
relevant
to
the
exercise
of
their
discretion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
the
statute
of
--
that
confined
him
under
the
--
where
is
the
1917
statute?
i
--
i've
been
--
he
wasn't
untrammeled
before,
wasn't
--
he
wasn't
trammeled?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
freedom
did
he
have?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
page?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
merit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
speak
on
the
merit.
all
right.
where
is
it?
on
top
of
the
page
or
about
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
case
of
an
alien?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now,
what
--
forget
about
--
forget
about
actual
reference
to
the
statute,
the
1952.
what
is
it
that,
intrinsically,
the
board
drew
upon
that
it
couldn't
have
drawn
upon
in
the
act
that
it
stood
in
1940?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
may
i
trouble
you,
mr.
long,
to
get
out
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
argumentation
of
abstraction
to
this
extent.
judge
hincks,
the
court
below
agreed
that
suspension
could
not
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
the
1952
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
further
found
and
concluded
that,
in
fact,
suspension
was
not
on
the
latter
act,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is
this.
what
concrete
considerations,
not
saying
we
decide
this
under
the
1952
act
which
has
brought
us
suspensory
--
non-suspensory
powers
but
what
item,
what
consideration
stated,
not
as
an
abstraction
that
one
is
more
than
the
other.
what
was
the
consideration,
which
in
judge
hincks'
view
was
not
an
application
of
the
1952
standard
but
was
a
fact
allowable
to
be
taken
into
consideration
until
--
under
the
1940
authority?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
often
hear
that
argument
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
power
of
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
as
standards.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
judge
hincks
says
they
didn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
judge
hincks
says
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know.
well,
therefore,
that's
why
you
have
to
--
from
my
point
of
view,
establish
a
fact
that
although
he
said
they
didn't
take
the
standard
into
account,
in
fact
they
did.
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
judge
hincks
isn't
the
most
scrupulous
man
in
the
world
if
he
--
i
believe
him
to
be,
scrupulous
as
anybody.
but
what
is
it
that
led
him
to
say,
they
took
into
consideration
a
fact
or
a
factor
that
was
relevant
but
not
the
law
of
1952?
justice
felix
frankfurter
taking
them
into
account?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
the
language
of
the
board
in
which
they
said
that,
mr.
long?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
looking
for
the
past
sentence,
which
we
interrupt
in
this
decision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
that
statement
implies
that
everybody
who
is
eligible
must
have
suspension
granted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
couldn't
--
you
can't
take
that,
can
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
they
originally
ruled
to
suspend
their
--
they
recommended
against
(inaudible)
suspension.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
we
then
ask
for
a
rehearing
and
they
reconsidered
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
they
had
said
that
while
some
hardship
is
worth
nevertheless
we
conclude
it.
the
suspension
--
suspension
should
now
be
exercised
in
favor
of
this
applicant.
they
then
said
we
are
confirmed
in
this
conclusion
in
the
congress
instead
of
making
us
--
indicating
we
should
be
more
merciful
or
--
or
more
generous
in
our
--
in
our
disposition,
it's
indicated
that
in
its
policy
it
turned
to
be
steeper.
so
instead
of
reconsidering,
we
are
confirmed.
suppose
they've
said
that
would
you
have
a
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
be
with
you
without
question.
i'm
not
saying
i'm
--
i'm
against
you
even
though
my
question
is
indicating
i'm
trying
to
be
against
you.
but
i
should
be
with
you
clearly
if
they
had
originally
ordered
that
suspension
--
the
recommended
suspension.
and
then
the
government
had
come
in
and
said,
"look,
congress
vindicated
you
but
as
much
as
we
saw,
the
word
isn't
mine
but
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
they
said,
"well,
in
light
of
that,
we
now
realize
we
have
been
too
easygoing.
that
we
now
see
that
--
although
we
act
under
the
old
act,
we
shouldn't
be
so
easygoing.‚Äù
i
think
that
would
be
wonderful,
but
if
they
denied
suspension
and
then
say
we
are
confirmed
in
this
conclusion
by
what
is
indicated
that's
not
meant
to
be
an
alleviation
but
a
harshening,
if
you
will,
of
the
requirement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
see
that
they
didn't
fairly
acted
on
that.
they
simply
found
confirmation
that
there
shouldn't
be
any
easier
going
than
they
were
in
their
original
conclusion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
they
haven't
granted
a
rehearing?
well
then
granted
a
rehearing,
they
wouldn't
have
to
give
a
rehearing
or
do
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
they
haven't
granted
the
rehearing,
what
would
be
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
original
one?
on
the
original
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
original
order?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
see.
oh,
well.
well,
then
--
then
the
gravamen
of
your
position
is
not
that
they
drew
on
the
1952
act
but
that
they
got
confirmation
for
what
already
was
lawless?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
said
we
stand
on
that
and
we're
strengthened
in
our
view.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
suggesting
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
suggesting
to
you
is
that
if
you
convince
the
court,
at
least
one
member
of
it
about
his
concern,
that
their
original
examination
was
arbitrary
and
baseless
in
law.
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
1952.
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
their
resort
to
1952.
on
the
other
hand,
i
have
the
greatest
of
troubles,
if
you
can't
do
that
as
to
the
original
finding
that
that
is
cut
from
under
because
they
find
reinforcement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
hope
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
hope
it
will
seem
to
you
--
desirably
in
the
use
of
your
remaining
time
that
you
deal
with
that
a
little
bit,
because
if
you
establish
that
and
you
didn't
bother
about
the
1952
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
all
we
are
concerned
about.
you
can't
--
you
can
split
up
the
whole
immigration
policy
which
to
me
is
full
of
outrageous
objects.
you
can't
just
call
out
one
consideration
in
the
case
of
our
system
that
has
all
the
purposes,
as
i
say
hardships
and
cruelty
that
i
think
it
has
and
say
we
must
construe
it
merely
with
reference
of
their
child.
otherwise
we
talk
about
writing
legislation,
otherwise
big
enough
to
deal
with
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
proper
--
i
understand
something
that's
rationally
related
for
the
task
of
judgment.
but
i'm
--
what
i
would
do,
i
can
assure
you
i
do
very
different
things
in
most
of
these
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
were
deported,
well,
because
they
came
here
unlawfully?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
roberts,
would
you
mind
dealing
with
the
point
that
my
mr.
long
raised
that
i'm
ignorant
about.
suppose
there
are
100
illegally
entered
greeks,
would
that
affect
those
waiting
for
visas
to
come
here?
i
don't
mean
merely
on
his
mathematics
but
on
generally?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
sorry.
i
thought
these
are
greeks.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
turkey
has
a
very
low
quota.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
in
600
of
the
--
of
something
like
that
at
turkish
quota
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
any
turk
national,
turkey-born
immigrant
as
a
deportation
suspended
the
--
from
the
630,
that
would
be
counted
one
and
there
are
only
629
left?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
its
--
its
discretion
must
be
individualized.
it
can't
make
a
class
determination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
can't
--
it
can't
say
our
experience
has
been
that
nationals
of
this
country
or
our
experience
has
been
that
seamen
who
come
here
in
one
way.
it
must
be
distinctly
--
completely
individualized
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
that
right,
mr.
roberts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
suppose
--
suppose
even
though
they
don't'
want
to
run
to
the
immigration
naturalization
division
but
they
do
like
to
get
--
get
some
enlightenment.
suppose
russia
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
take
her.suppose
for
some
reason
greece
won't
take
him,
i
mean
turkey
won't
take
him.
that's
a
possibility,
isn't
it?
may
i
--
may
i
say
this,
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they'd
go
back
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
well,
greece
has
been
changing
its
mind
about
several
things
recently.
suppose
greece
wouldn't
take
one
or
the
other.
what
then
if
one
has
to
stay
here
for
six
months,
like
nothing
happens
for
six
months,
that's
not
an
inconceivable
situation,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
boats
be
allowed
to
stay
here
plus
the
baby?
babies
(inaudible)
citizen
might
become
a
president
of
the
united
states
one
of
this
days.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
i
didn't
seem
to
hear
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
child
can't
be
refused
the
passport
because
--
oh,
i
better
not
talk
about
what
you
may
or
may
not
refuse
in
passports.
all
right.
or
that
the
child
is
an
american
citizen
and
has
an
american
passport,
and
incidentally
i
believe
he
is
also
a
greek
citizen.
i
believe
he
is
a
dual
national.
i
should
like
to
turn
now
to
the
--
the
consideration
of
the
--
whether
the
--
the
one
sentence
in
the
board's
opinion
on
reconsideration
was
improper.
the
board
there
merely
referred
to
the
1952
act
and
its
background
without
indicating
in
any
way
that
it
considered
itself
inhibited
by
that.
we
--
we
construe
that
as
the
court
below
did
as
merely
indicating
that
its
decision
was
consonant
with
the
1952
act,
rather
than
dictated
by
the
act.
but
as
i
pointed
out
the
--
the
statute
did
not
set
any
limits
on
the
considerations
which
might
be
taken
into
account
by
the
attorney
general
in
weighing
his
discretion.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
quite
proper
for
the
attorney
general
to
take
into
account
the
feeling
of
congress
and
the
observations
of
congress
made
after
a
long
study.
now,
the
1952
act
and
i
might
point
out
that
we
agree
that
1917
act
governs
this
case.
but
the
1952
act
was
a
long
time
aborning.
congress,
i
believe
it
was
in
1948,
authorized
the
senate
judiciary
committee
to
make
a
study
of
the
way
the
immigration
laws
were
operating.
and
they
made
a
very
intensive
study,
which
resulted
in
senate
report
1515
which
this
court
has
referred
to
in
many
opinions.
that
was
an
elaborate
report
and
it
dissected
the
operations
of
the
immigrations
laws
and
the
manner
in
which
the
immigration
service
had
administered
those
laws.
that
study
came
out
in
1950
while
the
1917
act
was
still
operative.
and
as
a
result
of
that
study
various
bills
were
introduced,
which
finally
culminated
and
in
the
mccarran-walter
act
which
is
the
1952
act.
and
its
--
in
its
consideration
of
these
bills,
congress
had
various
reports
in
which
it
commented.
it
gave
its
views
on
what
it
considered
the
inadequacy
of
the
old
law
and
also
it
was
critical
of
the
manner
in
which
the
old
law
had
been
executed
in
some
respects.
now,
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
the
attorney
general's
power
to
suspend
is
not
the
final
word
in
these
cases,
because
congress
has
reserved
to
itself
something
which
is
more
than
a
veto
power.
if
the
attorney
general
--
and
this
is
under
1917
act
as
well
as
under
the
1952
act,
if
the
attorney
general
suspends
deportation
in
any
case,
he
must
refer
the
facts
to
the
congress
and
unless
congress
affirmatively
passes
a
concurrent
resolution
approving
that
suspension
that
all
is
for
naught
and
the
attorney
general
is
commanded
to
proceed
with
deportation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
a
time
within
which
congress
must
so
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
roberts,
how
many
application
for
suspension
during
the
(inaudible)
one
of
these
years
were
there,
of
the
total
applications
and
the
total
number
of
granted
or
rejected?
have
you
got
those
figures
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
might
be
good
enough
to
give
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
when
you
give
the
figure
of
1021,
are
those
where
the
attorney
general
exercised
his
discretion
in
favor
of
suspension?
yes,
sir.
what
i
would
like
to
know
is
how
many
applications
have
been
made
to
him,
the
total
sum
of
which
1021
were
those
that
were
favorably
considered.
i
don't
have
the
figures
on
that
sir.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
the
denials
are
not
afforded
in
statistics?
but
there
are
denials,
aren't
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
that
they
probably
--
they
must
have
the
number
of
applications,
not
merely
applications
granted,
actually
describe
that
they
didn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
however
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
these
--
these
recommendations
go
to
the
commission
--
committee
on
immigration
in
the
house?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
get
him,
i
have
a
faint
recollection
of
the
congressman
--
representative
ordered
--
keeps
a
sharp
eye
on
his
business.
