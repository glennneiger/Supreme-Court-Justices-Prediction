you
see
--

that
the
board
had
turned
down
this
suspension
before
the
act
of
1952
and
then
turned
down
again
after
the
act
of
1952?

when
is
it
they
first
turned
it
down?
justice
harold
burton
when
was
that?
justice
harold
burton
there's
nothing
in
this
to
show,
is
it?
justice
harold
burton
supposing,
instead
of
a
--
a
new
act,
there's
been
new
book
published
would
it
--
would
this
been
all
right
for
the
board
to
take
that
into
theory?
justice
harold
burton
the
saving
clause
is
there
but
the
application
of
it
continues
on
and
the
person
who
would
--
who
administer
makes
up
a
discretion
to
the
test
of
his
knowledge
probably
and
test
of
his
right.
