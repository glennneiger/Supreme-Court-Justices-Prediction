you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
one
question,
mr.
long?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you,
on
your
motion
for
reconsideration,
suggest
that
the
board
had
in
fact,
in
its
first
determination,
applied
the
1952
standards
rather
the
1917
standards?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
did
you
charge
that
in
the
motion
or
how
did
you
do
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
did
you
affirmatively
suggest
that
the
board's
original
determination,
which
as
i
understand
it,
came
down
to
1954,
two
years
after
the
1952
act
came
on
the
books?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
affirmatively
suggest
that
they
had
determined,
made
their
original
determination
on
the
1952
standards?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
does
that
--
does
that
go
this
--
along
this
line
that
the
eligibility
requirements
having
been
met?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
conceding
that
discretion?
nevertheless,
is
vested
that
despite
satisfying
the
eligibility
premise
is
nevertheless
discretion
under
the
1917
act
whether
or
not
to
grant
suspension.
if
they're
going
to
deny
it,
admitting
the
eligibility
requirements
were
met,
they
have
to
ascribe
reasons
for
the
denial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
your
point
was
that
that
had
not
been
done
in
the
initial
determination?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
the
1952
act
did
--
wasn't
enacted
from
december
1952?
