mr.
harvey
a.
miller,
jr.
may
the
court
please.
in
the
short
time
alloted
to
me,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
particularly,
i
think,
to
the
most
important
factors
of
the
case
as
it
is
before
us.
first,
if
i
may
borrow,
mr.
griswold's
own
definition
as
i
noticed
he
used
it
of
the
basic
part
of
this
action
conversion.
he
defined
it
as
a
conversion
to
his
own
use
or
as
the
case
may
be,
it's
own
use.
and
i
think
that
is
the
problem
which
we
have
before
us
here
now.
and
the
problem
that
the
courts,
united
states
state
courts
also
have
been
confronted
with.
and
in
mentioning
that,
it
leads
me
to
a
discussion
which
it
was
referred
to
that
i
would
state
next
with
reference
to
the
first
national
bank
of
blairstown
versus
goldberg
case,
a
pennsylvania
case
and
i
believe
the
lead
case
on
the
pennsylvania
law
on
this
subject.
i
will
mention
it
in
passing
here
so
that
this
court
may
know
that
that
was
a
case
in
which
not
only
was
goldberg
an
individual
party,
but
a
bank
as
a
transmittal
agent
or
conduit
as
the
case
maybe
was
also
a
party.
and
in
the
pennsylvania
decision,
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
affirmed
a
judgment
in
all
the
in
favor
of
that
bank
stating
that
there
was
no
proof
upon
which
to
support
a
verdict
against
the
bank
and
that
therefore
the
judgement
in
a
way
should
be
sustained.
i
mention
that
as
pennsylvania
law
we
can
go
to
new
york
law
and
find
that
same
scienter.
to
go
on
from
there,
to
the
problem
of
the
negotiable
instruments
law
as
such,
the
problem
there
is
that
the
petitioner
is
trying
to
use
a
section
of
the
negotiable
instruments
law
whether
it
be
used
as
a
source
of
federal
law
here
or
otherwise.
and
we
maintain
most
vigorously,
although
i
will
not
have
time
to
advocate
that
particularly
that
it
is,
for
that
matter,
subject
to
being
examined
insofar
as
the
source
of
federal
law.
but
the
section
of
the
negotiable
instruments
law
which
the
petitioner
is
attempting
to
use
utterly
will
not
fit
the
circumstances
of
the
defendant,
first
national
bank
in
indiana,
the
respondent
here.
the
section
which
he
refers
to,
presupposes
a
purchaser
situation.
this
bank
is
not
a
purchaser
and
as
is
done
everyday
throughout
the
course
of
commerce
bear
instruments
both
the
united
states
government
and
otherwise
are
taken
by
in
by
banks
unquestioned,
almost
without
meeting
the
party,
in
many
instances
without
the
meeting
the
party
who
brings
it
there
to
the
bank.
it's
brought
by
a
messenger,
in
many
instances.
in
the
great
value
of
united
states
government
securities,
today,
is
the
fact
that
they
can
pass
freely
from
hand
to
hand
that
a
messenger
from
a
brokerage
house
may
carry
them
to
a
bank.
and
that
they
maybe
transmitted
on
from
there.
the
petitioner
mentions
the
ex
post
facto
uniform
commercial
code
as
a
guide
to
what
might
be
a
modern
trend.
and
i
would
call
this
court's
attention
to
the
section
which
the
--
to
which
the
petitioner
refers
and
call
the
attention
particularly
to
the
fact
that
it
says,
“except
in
case
of
purchase”.
that
then
this
one
year
or
two-year
limitation
on
the
fact
of
the
attachment
to
the
coupons
applies.
and
in
coming
then
to
the
fact
of
the
coupons
being
here
attached
leads
us
to
the
federal
regulations
with
reference
to
united
states
government
securities
of
all
kind
and
including
those
which
are
guaranteed,
of
course,
by
the
united
states
government
as
in
this
case.
the
regulation
states,
specifically,
that
upon
call,
the
coupons,
inoperative
coupons,
i
believe,
in
the
briefs,
as
have
been
submitted
by
petitioner
in
this
case,
they
very
often
probably,
inadvertently,
referred
to
them
as
overdue
coupons.
it's
an
easy
error
to
fall
into.
however,
it
is
important
to
note
that
these
were
merely
inoperative
coupons.
that
as
of
the
date
of
the
call,
those
coupons
should
be
left
attached.
and
we
refer
in
our
brief
particularly,
to
that
point
that
the
united
states
government
regulation
state
that
these
coupons
shall
be
left
attached
to
the
bonds.
and
i
think
it
will
be
found
that
the
federal
reserve
bank
would
refuse
to
carry
them
through
regular
channels,
had
those
coupons
not
been
attached.
the
--
the
suspicious
circumstance,
in
other
words,
would
have
been
had
those
coupons
been
taken
off,
for
some
reason
or
other.
these
bonds
were
taken
in
a
condition
received
by
the
bank
in
indiana
and
transmitted
by
registered
mail
a
distance
of
60
miles,
i
believe
it
is,
approximately
from
indiana,
pennsylvania
to
the
cleveland
branch
of
the
federal
reserve
bank
at
pittsburg,
pennsylvania.
they
were
then,
of
course,
as
has
been
stated
by
a
counsel
previously,
return
--
the
--
the
credit
was
then
returned
by
mail
to
the
bank
in
indiana
and
only
at
that
time
did
the
bank
then
pay,
describing
clearly
what
has
been
our
position
from
the
inception
of
this
case
even
in
pretrial
argument
or
pretrial
discussion,
in
the
pretrial
of
the
case
in
the
district
court
level
that
these
bonds
were
carried
--
carried
through
in
the
exact
procedure
that
the
united
states
government
prescribes.
the
federal
regulations
further
contemplate
that
member
banks
of
the
federal
reserve
system,
which
by
the
way,
the
first
national
bank
in
indiana
was.
it
contemplates
in
a
section
in
which
we
have
referred
to
in
our
brief
that
the
bond
shall
be
carried
for
redemption,
that
it's
cleared
for
redemption
through
member
banks
of
the
federal
reserve
system.
in
stating
that
the
authorizing
--
the
credit
be
made
by
the
federal
reserve
bank
to
member
banks
upon
the
redemption
of
such
bonds
as
these.
it
is,
therefore,
our
present
position
and
may
i
state
in
conclusion.
that
i
think
a
most
important
factor
to
look
at,
is
that
nowhere
in
the
briefs
of
petitioner
has
there
been
suggested
any
remedy
or
any
means
whereby
the
united
states
government
bonds
may
be
redeemed
safely
and
securely
through
the
ordinary
channels
of
commerce,
unless
this
court
applies
the
united
states
law,
the
federal
law
on
the
subject.
the
bonds
were
negotiable
in
the
very
highest
sense
of
negotiability.
and
we
think,
therefore,
that
it
was
on
--
the
burden
was
on
the
petitioner
to
show
that
which
it
charged,
the
act
of
conversion
which
had
the
element,
not
just
of
touching
the
bonds
but
of
converting
the
bonds
to
its
own
use.
