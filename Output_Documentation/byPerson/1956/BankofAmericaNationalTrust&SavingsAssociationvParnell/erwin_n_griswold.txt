mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
now,
this
is
an
action
for
tort,
the
tort
of
conversion
of
property.
the
plaintiff
is
a
national
bank
located
in
california.
in
may,
1944,
it
was
the
owner
of
a
large
number
of
bonds
of
the
home
owners'
loan
corporation,
which
it
had
acquired
from
its
customers.
these
bonds
had
been
called
for
redemption
on
may
1st,
1944.
and
while
they
were
in
the
plaintiff's
premises,
a
few
days
after
that,
they
--
they
were
stolen
or
at
least
they
mysteriously
disappeared.
there's
now,
an
interval
of
four
years,
more
than
four
years.
we
next
hear
of
the
bonds
in
early
september,
1948,
when
one
rocco,
began
a
series
of
transactions
with
parnell,
who
was
a
lawyer
in
the
town
of
indiana,
pennsylvania.
now,
although
this
town
of
indiana,
all
of
the
events
in
this
case,
subsequent
to
the
theft,
occurred
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
early
in
september,
1948,
rocco
took
some
west
penn
power
bonds
and
some
treasury
bonds
not
directly
involved
in
this
case
to
parnell.
parnell
took
the
bonds
to
the
first
national
bank
in
indiana
of
which
he
was
a
director.
at
the
bank,
parnell
dealt
with
one
(inaudible)
the
cashier
of
the
bank.
and
the
latter
cost
this
first
lot
of
bonds
to
be
sold.
now,
when
the
bank
received
credit,
parnell
was
notified
by
telephone.
he
went
down
to
the
bank
and
was
handed
a
cashier's
check
for
the
proceeds
plus
a
small
service
charge.
he
immediately
endorsed
the
check
and
took
the
proceeds
and
bills
of
$100
each
and
a
few
smaller
bills
though
the
amount
was
nearly
$25,000.
eighteen
days
later,
rocco
brought
to
parnell,
$19,600
in
home
owners'
loan
corporation
bonds
which
where
the
petitioner's
property.
parnell
took
these
to
the
bank
which
transmitted
them
to
the
federal
reserve
bank
of
cleveland,
the
pittsburgh
branch.
again,
when
the
credit
came
through,
parnell
was
notified
by
telephone.
he
went
down
to
the
bank,
received
the
cashier's
check
this
time,
for
$19,590,
which
he
then
endorsed
and
received
the
proceeds
in
cash,
in
bills
of
a
hundred
dollars
and
less.
and
twenty
seven
days
later,
in
october
1948,
rocco
gave
to
parnell
and
parnell
brought
to
the
bank
$38,000
in
home
owners'
loan
corporation
bonds
and
the
same
procedure
was
followed
and
parnell
eventually
cashing
the
check
for
$37,980,
and
taking
it
in
one
hundred
dollar
bills
and
smaller
denominations.
now,
it's
these
two
latter
lots
of
bonds
of
$57,600
in
face
amount
for
which
this
suit
is
brought.
there
were,
at
first,
four
defendants
rocco,
parnell,
the
lawyer,
the
first
national
bank
in
indiana,
and
the
federal
reserve
bank
of
cleveland.
the
trial
court
dismissed
the
suit
as
to
the
federal
reserve
bank
of
cleveland
and
that
is
no
longer
involved
in
the
case.
after
a
trial
before
a
jury,
verdicts
and
judgement
were
rendered
against
rocco,
parnell,
and
the
first
national
bank
in
indiana.
rocco
did
not
appeal.
so,
he,
is
no
longer
before
this
court.
i
may
say
that
he
is
now
in
prison
having
been
convicted
of
the
crime
of
transporting
stolen
bonds
in
interstate
commerce.
parnell
and
the
first
national
bank
in
indiana
took
an
appeal
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
and
they
there
obtained
a
reversal
from
the
full
bench
of
that
court
by
a
four-to-three
decision.
and
the
case
is
now
here
on
certiorari
to
review
that
decision
.
as
i
said
in
my
opening
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
federal
reserved
bank
immediately
cashed
the
bonds
and
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
were
then
cancelled
and
the
fact
that
they
were
stolen
was
apparently
not
discovered
for
several
months
later
at
which
time
agents
of
the
fbi
visited
the
parties.
the
facts
became
known
and
the
various
--
the
criminal
proceeding
against
rocco
and
one
or
two
other
civil
proceedings
and
in
particular
this
civil
proceeding
eventuated.
but
the
federal
reserved
bank
as
the
fiscal
agent
of
the
united
states
cashed
the
bonds
without
the
detecting
the
fact
that
they
had
been
stolen.
the
complaint
in
this
case
in
each
of
its
several
counts
at
pages
13,
14,
and
15
of
the
record,
states
that
on
or
about
certain
dates,
the
defendant
converted
to
his
own
use
a
certain
home
owners'
loan
corporation
bond.
that
is
what
the
suit
is
for.
it
is
for
a
conversion.
the
action
was
brought
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
pennsylvania.
the
basis
for
jurisdiction
there
being
diversity
of
citizenship.
all
of
the
defendants
were
citizens
of
pennsylvania
or
the
federal
reserve
bank
of
ohio
and
the
plaintiff
is
a
citizen
of
california.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
say
it
couldn't
be.
i
say
that
is
the
basis
upon
which
it
was
brought
after
this
court
had
decided
it
may
turn
out
that
was
a
federal
question.
but
that
was
not
the
ground
which
was
then
asserted.
and
it
is
our
position
that
there
is
no
federal
question
here
which
i
think
is
well
supported
by--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
our
position.
my
statement
was
simply
meant
to
state
the
fact
that
the
case
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
was
brought
as
a
diversity
case.
a
trial
was
held
which
lasted
for
five
days.
at
the
close
of
the
evidence,
the
trial
court
charged
the
jury.
and
the
legal
question
which
is
before
this
court
turns
on
the
correctness
of
this
charge
and
is
basically,
i
think
a
very
simple
one.
in
order
that
the
court
may
see
in
small
compass
precisely
what
the
issue
is,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
to
turn
to
page
422
of
the
record
which
is
in
the
midst
of
the
court's
charge.
the
important
language
is
on
that
page
about
two
inches
from
the
top
of
the
page
in
the
third
sentence
and
the
second
paragraph
of
the
page
as
the
court
said,
"as
i
have
indicated
however,
in
this
--
in
the
case
and
if
you
find
in
this
case
that
the
plaintiff
own
these
bonds
that
they
were
stolen
from
it,
then
the
burden
of
proof
so
far
as
this
plaintiff
is
concerned,
is
to
show
that
fact
that
these
bonds
were
owned
by
it,
that
they
were
lost
by
it
in
the
manner
as
shown
by
the
evidence.
then
the
two
defendants,
parnell
and
the
bank,
not
claiming
to
the
owners
per
value,
but
as
conduits
for
redemption,
must
come
forward
and
they
then
have
the
burden
of
showing
that
they
acted
innocently,
honestly
and
in
good
faith.”
and
the
sole
question
in
the
case,
i
think,
is
the
correctness
of
that
last
sentence
which
put
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
defendants,
parnell
and
the
bank,
to
come
forward
and
they
then
have
the
burden
of
showing
that
they
acted
innocently,
honestly,
and
in
good
faith.
now,
if
for
any
reason
that
charge
is
wrong,
if
the
burden
should
not
have
been
put
on
the
defendants,
then
it
seems
to
me
quite
obviously
that
the
defendants
are
entitled
to
a
new
trial
even
though
the
evidence
would
have
justified
the
verdict
reached,
they're
entitled
to
a
trial
given
to
the
jury
on
proper
instructions.
on
the
other
hand,
if
this
charge
is
correct,
then
it
seems
to
me
there
is
no
material
factual
question
before
this
court
or
any
other
court.
it
is
overwhelmingly
clear
on
the
record
that
the
defendants
have
not
maintained
the
burden
of
proving
that
they
acted
innocently,
honestly,
and
in
good
faith.
on
the
basis
of
that
charge,
the
jury
found
a
verdict,
the
$57,600
against
the
three
defendants.
and
thus,
the
jury
must
have
concluded
that
the
defendants
did
not
meet
the
burden
of
proving
that
they
had
acted
innocently,
honestly,
and
in
good
faith.
it
may
be
pointed
out,
too,
that
the
verdict
had
the
approval
of
the
trial
judge
who
also
saw
and
heard
the
witnesses
in
denying
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
disappears
on
page
447
of
the
record.
now,
the
trial
judge
said
the
question
as
to
whether
defendants
parnell
and
the
bank
in
indiana
acted
innocently
and
in
good
faith
was
for
the
jury.
the
jury
has
spoken
and
it
is
believed
that
the
verdict
is
just
and
proper
under
the
evidence
presented.
in
the
opinion
of
the
court,
substantial
justice
is
done
by
the
jury's
verdict.
we
come
now
to
the
question
of
law,
which
makes
this
case
one
which
ought
to
be
before
this
court.
it
is
wholly
clear,
i
believe,
that
the
charge
was
correct
if
the
case
is
one,
being
a
diversity
case,
which
should
be
governed
by
the
law
of
pennsylvania,
either
pursuant
to
the
conformity
act
of
1789
and
this
court's
decision
in
erie
railroad
or
as
the
appropriate
law
in
a
case
involving
private
property
rights
in
government
bonds.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
believe
it
is
a
fair
statement
to
say
that
there
is
none.
i
think
they
ought
to
speak
for
themselves
but
no
such
suggestion
is
made
in
their
briefs
that
the
charge
was
not
right
as
a
matter
of
pennsylvania
law.
the
respondents
contend
and
the
majority
of
the
court
below
has
held,
that
since
the
subject
matter
of
the
transaction
was
government
bond
or
more
specifically,
bonds
of
the
home
owners'
loan
corporation
guaranteed
by
the
united
states,
that
this
is
a
matter
where
the
question
of
liability
should
be
decided
according
to
"federal"
law.
i
put
the
“federal”
in
quotation
marks
because
it's
not
easy
to
see
just
where
this
federal
law
comes
from
but
it
is
apparently
some
different
law
than
the
state
law.
on
that
basis,
the
court
below
held
that
the
charge
was
wrong
and
reversed
the
judgments
of
the
district
court.
now,
our
position
on
this
question
falls
into
two
parts.
first,
that
this
is
a
suit
for
the
conversion
of
property
between
two
private
persons
where
the
government
is
not
a
party,
where
the
liabilities
of
the
government
are
not
affected
in
any
way,
shape
or
manner,
and
that
there
is
no
basis
for
a
conclusion
that
such
a
question
should
be
decided
according
to
any
sort
of
federal
law.
i
may
point
out
here,
now,
that
there
is
no
applicable
federal
statute,
no
applicable
federal
regulation
which
undertakes,
in
any
way,
to
deal
with
the
question
of
the
transfer
of
such
bonds
as
these
or
with
the
rights
of
private
persons
with
respect
to
such
transfers.
there
are
federal
regulations
that
deal
with
the
rights
of
the
government
when
they
are
paid
but
not
with
respect
to
the
transfer
of
rights
between
individuals.
and
it
is
our
contention,
second,
that
even
if
this
is
a
question
which
should
be
governed
by
some
sort
of
federal
law,
we
still
have
to
consider
what
is
the
proper
source
of
a
rule
in
such
a
case,
and
that
the
applicable
source
of
a
federal
rule
should
be
found
in
the
uniform
negotiable
instruments
law,
enacted
by
every
one
of
the
48
states
and
by
congress
for
the
district
of
columbia.
and
that
the
federal
rule,
the
federal
law
should
not
be
found
as
the
court
below
found
it
in
decisions
of
this
court
rendered
in
1864
and
1885
before
the
field
was
generally
codified
in
this
country.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
justice,
that
was
essentially
what
i
was
trying
to
say
with
respect
to
my
second
alternative.
that
it
ought
to
be
found
in
negotiable
instruments
law
since
every
state
has
absorbed,
has
provided
that
law.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
a
third
alternative
which
permits
the
variations
and
i
would
say
that
insofar
as
there
are
different
constructions
or
perhaps
alterations
in
negotiable
instruments
law
of
the
several
states,
that
whatever
the
law
is
in
the
particular
state
should
apply.
as
to
this
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
that
of
course
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
that
of
course,
that
point
was
made
very
well
by
mr.
justice
jackson
in
a
--
in
a
case
cited
by
mr.
dumbauld,
davies
warehouse
company
against
bowles
where
the
price
control
act,
the
federal
price
control
act
exempted
public
utilities.
and
the
court
held
that
once
a
public
utility
depends
upon
the
law
of
the
several
states
and
in
the
course
of
that
opinion,
justice
jackson
said,
"a
federal
system
makes
a
merit,
instead,
of
the
very
local
autonomy
in
which
complexities
are
inherent.”
and
he
went
on
to
say,
“the
great
body
of
law
in
this
country
which
controls
acquisition,
transmission
and
transfer
of
property
which
defines
the
rights
of
its
owners
in
relation
to
the
state
or
the
private
parties
is
found
in
the
statutes
and
decisions
of
the
states.”
and
we
would
say
that
that
rule
was
applicable
here
and
if
that
is
a
third
alternative
i'm
glad
to
put
it
that
way
in
this
particular
situation,
where
we
do
have
a
fairly
consistent
body
of
uniform
law
with
respect
to
negotiable
instruments
throughout
the
united
states.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
second
and
the
third
positions
comes
very
close
together.
for
the
respondents
to
be
successful
here,
they
must
both
maintain,
they
must
maintain
both
the
proposition
that
this
is
to
be
governed
by
a
uniform
or
some
sort
of
a
federal
law
and
not
state
law.
and
they
must
maintain
the
proposition
that
that
law
is
to
be
found
in
old
decisions
of
this
court,
rather
than
in
the
modern
and
negotiable
instruments
law
adopted
by
every
state
or
as
justice
frankfurter
has
suggested
in
the
rules
of
law
adopted
in
the
several
states
on
this
proposition.
before
i
go
further,
i'd
like
to
deal
with
one
matter
which
is
raised
throughout
the
respondents
briefs.
they
complained
that
we
say
that
they
were
not
holders
in
due
course.
they
say
they
don't
claim
to
be
holders
in
due
course.
they
were
merely
converts.
and
that
they
cannot,
therefore,
be
subjected
to
liability
as
holders
in
due
course.
now,
that's
a
new
conception
to
me
that
you
are
subjected
to
liability
as
a
holder
in
due
course.
of
course,
being
a
holder
in
due
course
is
not
a
basis
for
liability,
it's
a
defense.
and
it's
a
very
useful
defense,
too,
when
you
can
bring
yourself
within
it,
which
i
believe
the
respondents
cannot
do.
if
they
don't
want
to
be
holders
in
due
course,
it's
quite
alright
with
us.
it
merely
means
that
they
don't
claim
that
defense.
the
case,
then,
is
left
as
an
ordinary
suit
for
conversion
as
if
it
was
a
car
or
an
automobile
that
was
involved
here
instead
of
a
bond.
but
as
an
ordinary
suit
for
conversion,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
two
respondents
dealt
with
the
plaintiff's
property
and
that
as
a
result
of
those
dealings,
the
plaintiff
lost
its
property.
that's
what
a
conversion
is.
on
the
basis
of
these
facts,
the
respondents
are
liable
to
the
plaintiff
by
ancient
and
well-established
principles
of
the
common
law.
they
can
avoid
that
liability
only
by
establishing
some
sort
of
a
defense.
a
possible
defense
is
that
of
being
a
holder
in
due
course
but
they
disclaim
that.
the
only
other
defense
that
i
can
conceive
is
one
which
would
require
them
to
prove
that
they
acted
in
good
faith.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
were
these
bonds
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
these
bonds
were
due
in
1952.
they
had
been
called
on
may
1st,
1944.
they
were
stolen
from
the
petitioner
a
few
days
after,
the
date
when
they
had
been
called
and
could
be
redeemed.
they
were
presented
to
parnell
and
to
the
first
national
bank
in
indiana,
nearly
four
and
a
half
years
after
they
had
been
called
and
with
eight
interest
coupons
still
attached,
covering
the
period
from
1944
to
1948.
now,
i
was
careful
not
to
say
past
due
interest
coupons
because
those
interest
coupons
never
became
due.
now
they
--
they
have
our
coupons
which
were
effective
only
in
the
absence
of
a
call.
in
this
case
there
was
a
call
so
that
these
coupons
never
became
due
but
they
were
still
attached
to
the
bond
when
they
were
handled
by
parnell
and
the
first
national
bank.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
our
view
that
a
call
was
--
that
a
call
made
the
bonds
overdue
at
least
within
a
reasonable
time
after
the
date
of
the
call.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
interest
stopped
on
may
1,
1944
and
that
was
understood
by
both
parties.
parnell
took
the
bonds
to
the
bank
for
redemption,
(inaudible),
the
cashier
of
the
bank
testified
that
he
knew
that
they
had
been
called.
they
were
four
and
a
half
years
pasts
due
and
no
payment,
of
course,
was
made
on
account
of
these
interest
coupons.
incidentally,
this
is
a
further
point
in
our
case
that
dealt
within
our
brief.
i'm
afraid
i
will
not
have
time
to
deal
with
it
in
any
detail
here.
but
we
contend
that
quite
apart
from
many
question
of
good
faith,
that
people
who
deal
in
bonds
four
and
a
half
years
after
maturity
cannot
take
the
defenses
available
to
a
holder
in
due
course.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
the
-
the
uniform
negotiable
instruments
law
has
no
provision
dealing
with
this.
and
this
is
something
which
has
been
dealt
in
the
books
to
some
extent,
some
of
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
the
uniform
commercial
code
which
has
been
approved
by
the
uniform
commissioners
and
enacted
in
one
state
of
pennsylvania
but
after
the
date
when
this
transaction
occurred,
it
does
deal
with
this
question
and
i
think
that
may
be
used
as
some
evidence
of
what
good
thought
in
the
area
is.
and
it
has
a
provision
that
called
bonds
shall
remain
negotiable
for
a
year
after
the
call,
unless
funds
are
available
for
their
payment
in
which
case
it
shall
be
six
months.
now,
there
is
an
old
case
decided
by
this
court
in
1885.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
that
seems
obvious
to
me,
mr.
justice,
and
--
and
as
i
say
straight
if
the
cashier
testified
that
he
knew
they
were
called
all
the
time.
he
was
never
in
any
--
in
any
doubt
about
it.
parnell
was
--
was
confused
and
uncertain
in
his
testimony
and
in
particular
as
i
recall
it,
testified
that
he
didn't
see
anything
about
the
bond,
about
the
coupons
and
didn't
know
whether
they
were
there.
indeed
our
view
would
be,
that
the
very
confusion
and
uncertainty
in
parnell's
testimony
was
a
factor
which
the
jury
might
well
have
taken
into
account
in
concluding
that
he
did
not
maintain
the
burden
of
proving.
that
he
acted
innocently,
honestly,
and
in
good
faith
as
in
accordance
with
the
charge
of
the
trial
court.
now,
there
is
this
decision
of
this
court
in
1885,
somebody
against
the
united
states
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
morgan.
morgan
against
the
united
states
which
involved
government
bonds
which
had
been
acquired
by
a
fiscal
agent
of
the
united
states
within
about
three
months
after
they
are
called.
now,
this
agent
had
been
authorized
by
an
act
of
congress
to
carry
out
what
amounted
to
a
refunding
of
the
bond.
that
is
to
get
in
the
old
6%
bonds
and
to
issue
in
their
place
some
bonds
at
a
lower
rate
of
interest,
as
i
recall
it,
at
4%.
and
this
fiscal
agent
took
these
bonds
about
three
months
after
the
call
date.
it
turned
out
that
the
bonds
had
been
stolen
and
a
suit
was
brought
in
the
court
of
claims
which
eventually
came
to
this
court.
and
this
court
held
that
the
fiscal
agent
was
protected,
that
having
taken
the
bonds
within
three
months,
it
was
entitled
to
the
defenses
of
a
bonafide
purchaser.
now
actually
the
language
of
that
case
is
pretty
broad.
the
language
of
the
case
says
that
until
the
bonds
or
the
due
date
on
the
bonds
is
reached,
not
the
call
date,
that
they
remained
negotiable
instruments.
the
court
talks
in
what
seems
to
us
today
to
be
a
rather
--
in
a
rather
unreal
fashion
to
say
that
people
might
like
to
keep
these
bonds
as
the
equivalent
of
cash.
they'd
be
much
more
convenient
since
they
take
up
less
room
than
a
--
a
lot
of
cash.
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
way
we
think
they,
and
our
position
would
be,
that
morgan
against
united
states
is
a
pretty
good
case
as
applied
to
bonds
taken
within
a
reasonable
time
after
the
call
by
a
fiscal
agent
of
the
united
states
carrying
out
the
policy
of
the
united
states
and
refunding
the
bonds
that
it
ought
not
to
be
extended
to
a
--a
case
such
as
this
where
the
bonds
were
four
and
a
half
years
pass
the
call
and
had
eight
past
due
interest
coupons
attached.
and
in
that
connection,
i
would
call
attention
to
a
passage
in
this
court's
decision,
another
old
one
of
about
that
time,
parsons
against
jackson
in
99
u.s.,
where
the
court
said,
the
presence
of
the
past
due
and
unpaid
coupons
was,
itself,
an
evidence
of
dishonor
as
sufficient
to
put
the
purchasers
on
inquiry.
the
court
below
relied
primarily
on
the
clearfield
case,
clearfield
trust
company
against
the
united
states,
318
u.s.
363.
that
case
involved
a
government
check
which
was
presented
to
a
retail
store
with
a
forged
endorsement.
the
store
paid
it,
sent
it
to
its
bank.
the
bank
endorsed
it.
prior
endorsements
guaranteed,
sent
it
to
the
federal
reserve
bank
which
presented
it
to
the
treasury
and
the
treasury
paid
it.
some
time
later,
the
government
found
the
forgery
and
sought
to
recover
from
the
clearfield
trust
company.
under
the
law
of
pennsylvania,
where
that
transaction
occurred,
the
government
had
not
given
notice
soon
enough.
it
had
not
acted
promptly
enough.
when
the
case
came
to
this
court,
the
court
held
that
the
government
would
not
be
bound
by
the
law
of
pennsylvania
and
that
this
was
a
matter
which
should
be
governed
by
a
uniform
federal
rule.
the
court
then
undertook
to
fashion
that
uniform
federal
rule
in
essence
out
of
the
negotiable
instrument
cases
which
this
court
had
developed
during
what
might
be
called
the
regime
of
swift
and
tyson,
and
concluded
in
that
case
that
the
government
was
not
barred
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
it
had
not
complied
with
the
law
of
pennsylvania.
now,
we
would
point
out
the
obvious
fact
that
clearfield
involved
the
rights
of
the
government.
it
did
not
involve
the
rights
of
private
parties
between
themselves.
the
fact
that
clearfield
has
been
decided
does
not
lead
to
any
conclusion
that
all
things
with
respect
to
government
bonds
must
be
decided
by
a
federal
law.
this
court
has
since
decided
a
great
many
cases
holding
that
matters
of
obvious
federal
importance
are,
nevertheless,
to
be
governed
by
state
law.
last
spring,
in
(inaudible)
against
valentine,
the
copyright
case
involving
the
construction
of
the
word
"children"
in
the
federal
copyright
law,
the
court
held
that
it
was
to
be
decided
in
accordance
with
state
law.
we
would
suggest
that
if
there
is
to
be
a
federal
rule
in
this
case,
that
it
ought
to
be
prescribed
by
congress.
and
that
this
court
should
not
move
in
and
occupy
a
field
where
congress
has
not
indicated
at
any
time,
over
a
century
and
a
half,
that
it
feels
the
need
of
a
federal
rule.
in
that
connection,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
a
statute
i
just
stumbled
on,
on
monday
of
this
week.
it's
not
cited
in
my
brief.
it
was
passed,
approved
by
the
president
on
may
23rd,
1955.
and
it's
a
very
improbable
sort
of
a
statute
from
our
point
of
view.
it's
an
act
to
amend
the
commodity
credit
corporation
charter
act.
and
it
provides,
this
is
69
stat
65,
69
statutes
at
large,
65
act
of
may
23,
1955.
it
provides
that
a
buyer
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business
of
fungible
goods,
heretofore
or
hereafter
sold
and
physically
delivered
by
a
warehouseman
or
other
dealer,
who
is
regularly
engaged
in
the
business
of
buying
and
selling
such
goods,
shall
take
or
begin
to
have
taken
such
goods
free
of
any
claim
existing
or
hereafter
arising
by
the
commodity
credit
corporation.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
provide,
and
this
seems
to
me
to
be
very
significant
as
indicating
what
congress
thinks
about
such
things
if
it
ever
feels
it's
desirable
to
think
about
them,
the
final
sentence
in
the
statute
is,
to
be
entitled
to
relief
under
this
section.
a
buyer
must
assert
as
an
affirmative
defense
and
establish
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
the
facts
necessary
to
entitle
him
to
such
relief,
of
which
facts
are,
that
he
bought
such
goods
per
value
and
in
good
faith
and
did
not
have
reason
to
know
of
any
defect
and
so
there's
authority
to
sell
such
goods.
these
questions
are
developed
at
greater
length
in
our
brief
and
we
have
also
presented
a
reply
brief
which
deals
with
some
of
the
questions
dealt
within
the
respondent's
brief.
i
don't
have
opportunity
to
go
into
them
at
greater
length.
but
in
summary,
our
position
is,
that
this
is
not
an
area
which
is
suitable
or
necessary
for
a
uniform
federal
rule
even
if
this
court
should
decide
that
there
should
be
a
federal
rule
here,
unless
congress
acts,
we
aren't
going
to
get
a
uniform
federal
rule
for
50,
75
years.
if
this
court
is
willing
to
review
a
large
number
of
negotiable
instruments
law
cases
every
year,
it
can
in
the
course
of
time,
develop
a
body
of
federal
law
which
will
serve
as
a
guide
to
counsel
on
others
as
to
what
the
rule
is
in
such
cases
but
to
what
end?
what
plausible
gain
is
there
to
anyone
to
have
a
federal
rule
as
to
how
government
bonds
are
transferred
while
there
is
established,
a
--
a
well-established
and
well-accepted
and
well-thought
out
and
worked
out
and
provided
by
statute,
a
state
series
of
rules
dealing
with
the
transfer
of
such
property.
and
so
we
contend
that
this
is
not
a
matter
which
should
be
governed
via
federal
rule.
and
further,
that
even
if
it
should,
for
some
reason
or
other,
be
governed
by
a
federal
rule,
that
that
rule
should
be
found
in
the
laws
of
the
several
states.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
there
really
isn't
any
possible
basis
for
doubt
as
to
the
law
of
pennsylvania
in
this
case
nor
reason
why
the
case
should
be
remanded
for
determining
that
question.
that
the
very
case
to
which
both
counsel
have
referred
in
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court,
the
first
national
bank
of
blairstown
against
goldberg
is
quoted
from
on
page
13
of
our
reply
brief.
and
that
is
a
recent
case
in
pennsylvania,
1941,
and
is
the
latest
and
leading
case.
and
the
language
of
that
case
is,
it
was
incumbent
upon
plaintiff
to
prove
only
its
ownership
and
loss
of
the
bonds
and
the
burden
would
then
have
to
shifted
to
the
defendants
to
show
that
they
came
into
possession
of
the
securities
under
such
circumstances
as
to
relieve
--
to
relieve
them
from
liability
of
a
conversion.
now,
that
is
the
precise
length
which
the
trial
court
used
and
discharged.
it's
obvious
that
he
based
his
charge
upon
that
pennsylvania
case.
and
just
one
other
fact
in
the
picture
which
i
didn't
cover
in
my
original
statement,
the
testimony
of
rocco
that
when
parnell
brought
the
money
to
him
in
cash
and
he,
rocco,
paid
parnell,
$5500
to
$6000.
now,
parnell
testified
that
he
got
$650
as
a
retainer
and
counsel
fee,
but
rocco's
testimony
not
subjected
to
cross-examination,
in
any
way,
was
that
parnell
got
a
10%
share
and
rocco's
words
were
that,
i
don't
remember
whether
i
gave
him
his
or
whether
he
took
it,
which
seem
to
us
to
be
some
indication
of
the
nature
of
the
transaction
that
was
involved.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
parnell
is
the
director
and
the
depositor
of
the
bank.
