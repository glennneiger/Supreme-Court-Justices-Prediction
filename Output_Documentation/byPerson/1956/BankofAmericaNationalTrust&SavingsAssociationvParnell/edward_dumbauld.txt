mr.
edward
dumbauld
may
it
please
the
court.
the
main
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
bank
or
other
party
acting
solely
as
a
convert
or
intermediary
in
the
redemption
process
when
government
coupon
bearer
bonds
are
forwarded
through
channels
of
the
federal
reserve
system
for
redemption
can
be
held
liable
in
the
absence
of
proof
of
bad
faith
or
notice
of
some
infirmity
or
irregularity
for
conversion
of
the
bonds
handled.
if
i
may
just
dwell
for
a
moment
upon
the
fact,
i
want
to
emphasize
that
parnell
and
the
bank
simply
took
the
bonds
in
the
condition
received.
the
bank
sent
them
by
registered
mail
to
the
federal
reserved
bank
of
cleveland.
the
federal
reserve
bank
of
cleveland
as
fiscal
agent
for
the
united
states
definitively
redeemed
the
bonds.
and
then
as
the
regulations
provide,
credited
of
its
member
of
bank's
account,
the
first
national
bank
of
indiana.
and
that
bank,
thereupon,
issued
its
check
to
parnell.
parnell
cashed
the
check.
their
testimony
was
the
bank
didn't
carry
any
bills
over
hundred
dollars,
so
it
was
in
small
denominations,
less
than
$100
if
that's
important.
and
then
turned
over
the
proceeds
to
rocco.
and
the
--
later,
some
months
later,
it's
developed
that
these
bonds
had
mysteriously
disappeared
from
the
plaintiff's
banking
house
in
california.
but
there
was
no
evidence,
which
we
think,
warranted
going
to
the
jury
to
show
any
notice
on
the
part
of
either
parnell
or
the
bank.
now,
the
trial
court
treated
this
as
an
ordinary
or
garden
variety
of
diversity
case,
applied
state
law
under
erie
and
seized
upon
a
provision
in
the
pennsylvania
negotiable
instruments
law
which
says
there
is
a
presumption
that
a
holder
is
a
holder
in
due
course
and
then
if
there's
an
irregularity
in
the
inception
of
his
title
that
the
burden
is
upon
the
holder
to
prove
every
element
of
being
a
holder
in
due
course.
now,
our
contention
is
here,
that
this
case
is
not
one
that
falls
within
the
erie
doctrine
but
that
it
is
governed
by
the
clearfield
doctrine.
in
other
words,
it's
a
matter
of
federal
law
and
that
this
court
should
frame
the
rules.
and
then
the
main
point
on
which
we
lay
weight
is
that
in
framing
that
rule,
a
just
and
workable
rule,
which
will
exempt
from
liability
a
conduit
bank
should
be
framed,
and
it
should
not
--
the
court
should
not
mechanically
apply
the
state
negotiable
instrument
law,
which
i
believe
in
fact,
that
it's
held
in
a
connecticut
case
which
i
discovered
after
writing
the
brief,
is
thought
to
apply
not
to
conversion
actions,
but
the
suits
brought
on
the
note
or
the
negotiable
instrument
itself.
so
that
a
conduit
bank
never
gives
value
and
giving
value
is
indispensable.
it's
one
of
the
ingredients
of
being
a
holder
in
due
course.
so,
what
we
are
asking
you
to
do
when
you
frame
the
applicable
rule
is
not
to
say
that
a
conduit
bank
has
to
prove
it's
a
holder
in
due
course,
in
order
to
be
exempt
from
liability
for
conversion.
it
should
be
sufficient
merely
to
say
that
it
is
a
conduit
bank.
it
doesn't
give
value.
it
invested
no
fines
of
its
own
in
these
bonds
and
it
dispersed
what
it
received.
and
we
--
and
the
trial
court
said
if
we
had
given
value,
if
we
bought
these
for
our
own
portfolio,
then
he
would
have
directed
the
verdict
for
the
first
national
bank
of
indiana.
but
he
says
since
we
were
merely
a
conduit
bank,
a
different
rule
should
apply.
and
he
applied
to
us
a
more
severe
standard
of
proof
than
to
the
defendant,
rocco.
i
turn
to
the
same
page
of
the
record
as
my
learned
friend,
and
you'll
notice,
if
you
read
a
little
further
down
to
the
bottom,
he
says
that
rocco
is
entitled
to
the
presumption
of
being
a
holder
in
due
course.
the
plaintiff
has
the
burden
against
rocco,
the
rest
and
all
the
way
through
the
case.
but
as
to
the
bank
which
is
a
mere
conduit
and
which
set
the
bonds
on
for
redemption
in
the
condition
received
and
dispersed
the
proceeds
is
to
be
held
liable
if
it
fails
to
meet
all
the
requirements
of
the
nilsa
holder
in
due
course.
mr.
edward
dumbauld
yes?
mr.
edward
dumbauld
well,
i
find
that
expression
used
in
the
gruntal
case
in
254
new
york,
a
decision
in
which
justice
cardozo
was
then
chief
judge
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
the
word
is
also
used
in
the
goldberg
case
and
my
associate
will
discuss
a
greater
length
the
goldberg
case.
we
contend
that
under
the
law
of
pennsylvania,
even
the
status
of
a
conduit
should
be
recognized
as
free
from
liability.
mr.
edward
dumbauld
well,
we
contend
that
it
applies
to
other
conduits
including
the
lawyer
here
who
passed
them
on
to
the
banks.
let
me
just
read
a
section
from
the
goldberg
case.
it's
cited
in
our
brief.
"it
would
seem
strange
if
the
broker
who
is
thus
the
conduit
of
a
valid
title
should
be
held
responsible
for
a
conversion
although
he
acted
in
the
same
good
faith
as
the
purchaser."
in
the
present
case,
defendants
did
not
mark
with
value
for
the
bonds
but
they
do
not
claim
any
right
as
holders.
they
derive
no
benefit
from
the
transactions
and
so
forth.
that's
very
similar
to
our
situation
here.
and
we
submit
that
judge
goodrich
in
his
dissenting
opinion
below
is
really
just
manipulating
verbal
concepts
in
trying
to
make
out
holders
and
holders
in
due
course.
we
say
regardless
of
whether
we're
holders
in
due
course
or
not,
we
are
entitled
as
a
matter
of
a
just
and
workable
rule
in
the
interest
of
the
government
itself,
of
the
investing
public
and
of
the
banking
system
to
a
rule
that
would
relieve
us
from
liability
for
conversion.
now,
let
me
say
just
a
word
about
the
clearfield
case.
in
--
mr.
edward
dumbauld
that
would
be
true.
and
we
say
that
in
this
case
a
bank
which
is
a
conduit
acting
in
good
faith
with
no
notice
of
any
irregularity,
handling
a
negotiable
instrument
payable
to
bearer,
transferable
by
delivery
by
its
terms
should
be
protected.
that
is
essentially
our
position,
regardless
of
whether
you
call
us
a
holder
in
due
course
or
not.
we
think
you
actually
cannot
without
verbal
juggling
because
we
didn't
give
any
value.
but
we
think
that
as
an
instrumentality
of
commerce,
there
is
a
public
interest
which
justifies
freedom
from
liability.
and
we
think
and
have
cited
a
case
in
there
that
even
in
the
case
of
the
auctioneer
of
a
(inaudible)
which
is
not
instrument
transferable
for
value,
we
think
the
modern
tendency
is
to
relieve
this
innocent
parties.
mr.
edward
dumbauld
we
do.
that's
our
position
and
the
--
the
court
will
have
to
read
and
interpret
for
itself
the
goldberg
case
340
pennsylvania
337.
mr.
edward
dumbauld
340
pennsylvania
337.
mr.
edward
dumbauld
it
is
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
edward
dumbauld
yes,
sir.
it's
cited.
mr.
edward
dumbauld
oh,
it's
first
national
bank
of
bloomfield
or
some
place
against
(inaudible)
against
goldberg.
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
dumbauld
yes,
sir.
and
i
now
i
want
to
make
four
comments
about
the
clearfield
case.
in
the
first
place,
the
language
of
the
clearfield
case
is
not
limited
as
my
learned
friend
suggests
to
transactions
in
which
the
government
itself
is
a
party
litigant.
we
quote
from
that
case
the
reference
to
transactions
from
issuance
to
payment
which
it
says
would
arise
in
many
different
states
and
where
uniformity
should
exist.
so,
we
say
that
the
language
of
clearfield,
clearly,
is
extensive.
and
we
know
that
it
has
been
cited.
it's
a
procreative
precedent
that's
been
cited
in
many
cases
which
are
listed
in
our
brief
but
we
can't
go
over
here.
secondly,
the
fact
of
the
clearfield
case
itself.
the
liability
that
was
there
asserted
was
a
liability
of
a
bank
on
an
endorsement
which
it
made
in
pennsylvania.
that
was
a
transaction
between
issuance
and
payment.
it
was
a
transaction
not
directly
dealing
with
the
government.
of
course,
one
person's
duty
is
another
person's
right
and
in
that
sense
the
government
was
seeking
to
assert
liability
on
the
bank
arising
out
of
its
endorsement.
but
we
say
that
the
liability
of
that
endorsement
which
was
an
operative
event
in
pennsylvania,
in
the
clearfield
case
was
not
one
dealing
directly
with
the
government.
it
was
one
of
these
transactions
and
there
--
say
you
say
between
transferees
of
the
paper.
now,
thirdly,
i
want
to
point
out
that
my
learned
friend
in
page
20
of
his
brief
makes
a
great
deal
about
the
case
of
united
states
versus
guarantee
trust
company.
now,
if
you
do
not
distinguish
that
on
the
ground
that
it
involved
the
foreign
bills
sent
to
a
foreign
country,
the
case
clearly
evaporates
when
you
consider
that
it
is
a
free
clearfield
decision.
it's
a
pre
erie
decision
and
in
fact
it
was
the
case
upon
which
the
district
judge,
judge
(inaudible)
in
the
court
below
in
clearfield
relied
in
making
his
decision
which
was
reversed
in
clearfield.
so
that
i
suggest
that
all
of
that
disappears.
i
suggest,
also,
that
what
my
learned
friend
says
about
burns
mortgage
company
is
also
an
ingenuity
which
evaporates
because,
in
substance,
that
was
merely
an
orthodox,
swift
versus
tyson
holding
that
a
state
statute
should
be
followed
by
the
federal
court.
even
under
swift
versus
tyson,
they
followed
state
statute.
so
that
what
the
court
was
there
doing
was
applying
swift
versus
tyson
and
not
fashioning
a
federal
rule
out
of
state
law.
now,
another
thing
that
i
want
to
say
right
here
is
they
told
us
about
the
fact
that
our
decisions
date
back
to
the
hatties
(ph)
and
so
on.
well
actually,
their
suggestion
about
adopting
the
negotiable
instruments
law
is
also
a
reference
to
an
antique
statute
one
of
the
pioneer
uniform
state
statutes
taken
from
the
british
bills
of
exchange
act.
and
i
don't
think
that
there
is
anything
more
modern
or
worthy
and
the
negotiable
instruments
law
than
there
is
in
the
case
which
we
have
cited
in
this
court,
which
we
think
has
very
excellent
sound
reasoning
and
is
certainly
applicable
today
just
as
much
as
it
ever
was.
mr.
edward
dumbauld
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
dumbauld
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
dumbauld
yes,
that
is
--
mr.
edward
dumbauld
that
is
--
that
is
true
and
also,
there
were
a
number
of
what
we
think
clear
errors
on
the
admissibility
of
evidence
--
mr.
edward
dumbauld
--
that
were
not
passed
upon
by
the
court
--
mr.
edward
dumbauld
--
the
circuit
court
and
we're
not
concerned
with
that
here
either.
mr.
edward
dumbauld
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
dumbauld
yes,
a
--
erroneous,
we
submit
but
nevertheless,
the
court
of
appeals
goes
on
clearfield.
mr.
edward
dumbauld
now,
on
my
report
--
mr.
edward
dumbauld
not
necessarily,
if
you
accept
our
--
mr.
edward
dumbauld
--
first
contention
then
that
--
mr.
edward
dumbauld
--
if
you
don't
why
then
you
probably
would
have
to
reexamine
pennsylvania
law
and
also
go
under
the
rulings
on
evidence.
but
--
mr.
edward
dumbauld
--
but
our
actual
contention
is
that
clearfield
governs
--
mr.
edward
dumbauld
--
and
that
you
should
fashion
the
federal
rule.
now
my
fourth
and
before
--
mr.
edward
dumbauld
well,
that's
available
alternative
also,
your
honor.
it's
doubtless
correct
under
the
magnolia
doctrine.
now,
the
fourth
point
is
that
in
the
clearfield
case,
it
was
clearly
held
that
when
that
check
was
issued
for
a
wpa
worker,
that
was
the
payment
of
a
debt
of
the
united
states.
that
was
the
payment
of
a
debt
of
the
united
states
is
an
exercise
of
a
constitutionally
granted
power.
now,
we
say
that
that
is
also
and
equally
true
here.
when
the
federal
reserve
bank
of
cleveland
redeemed
these
government
bonds,
it
was
exercising
a
constitutional
power.
so
that
obviously,
insofar
as
federal
reserve
bank
of
cleveland
is
concerned,
we
have
a
question,
a
transaction
governed
by
federal
law.
and
we
say
that
if
it
governs
one
party
to
the
transaction,
the
federal
law
governs
also
the
other
party
to
the
transaction,
namely,
the
first
national
bank
in
indiana.
and
i
venture
to
go
a
step
further
and
say
that
the
whole
entire
process
of
redemption
is
a
matter
governed
by
federal
law.
they
didn't
sue
here
the
postal
clerk
who
registered
the
letter
or
the
mailman
who
delivered
the
bonds
at
cleveland.
they
might
as
well
have
in
our
view,
because
the
whole
process
of
redemption
is
one
governed
by
federal
law.
we
don't
say
that
all
transactions
about
bonds.
i
remember
the
--
the
case
about
transferring
a
radio
station
in
nebraska
or
you
might
have
a
sale
of
a
motor
carrier
requiring
approval
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
or
the
communications
commission
and
you
could
have
some
questions
under
state
law.
similarly,
you
might
have
here.
but
here,
we're
dealing
only
with
the
redemption
of
government
bonds.
and
we
submit
that
here,
clearfield
applies
and
that
it
should
and
must
apply
in
order
to
protect
the
nature
of
these
securities.
i
call
attention
to
the
standard
oil
case
about
the
soldier
sovereign
relationship.
and
if
the
court
says
that
if
the
federal
government
can
create
the
relation,
it
can
protect
it.
and
so
here,
that
congress
and
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
have
determined
that
these
shall
be
negotiable
bonds,
the
government
has
an
interest
in
their
free
negotiability
and
that
the
rule
suggested
by
the
minority
below
requiring
a
record
to
be
kept
of
the
roots.
the
others
say
that
these
bonds
passed
through
in
order
to
validate
the
transactions
under
state
law
would
substantially
impair
the
exercise
of
the
federal
government's
policy
in
shaping
the
public
debt
structure.
so
that,
now,
i
think
i
have
made
clear
that
our
first
point
is
that
clearfield
governs,
federal
law
governs.
secondly,
in
fashioning
the
rule,
you
should
take
a
workable
rule,
a
just
rule
that
will
exempt
parties
in
this
position
and
not
mechanically
apply
the
procrustean
categories
of
the
negotiable
instruments
law
of
pennsylvania.
mr.
edward
dumbauld
yes
sir,
we
have
that
covered
and
--
mr.
edward
dumbauld
yes,
we
do.
and
that's
the
main
point.
we
want
a
just
rule
to
be
applied
that
will
exempt
such
a
conduit
party
from
liability
whether
you
take
it
from
state
or
federal
law.
but
we
really
think
that
clearfield
clearly
applies
but
in
any
even
the
substantive
rule
is
what
we're
emphasizing.
and
now,
for
your
information
and
that
of
mr.
justice
burton,
that
point
three
of
my
brief
takes
up
the
question
about
maturity
in
the
presence
of
inoperative
coupons
which
we
think
did
not
lead
to
any
other
conclusion
and
would
have
--
mr.
edward
dumbauld
no,
that's
right.
it's
not
mature
and
the
fact
that
a
coupon
is
attached
does
not
import
any
notices
to
any
infirmity
as
to
the
principle
of
the
obligation
of
the
bond.
mr.
edward
dumbauld
well,
there
has
been
no
refusal
here.
mr.
edward
dumbauld
well,
that
--
mr.
edward
dumbauld
well,
these
coupons
were
inoperative
as
