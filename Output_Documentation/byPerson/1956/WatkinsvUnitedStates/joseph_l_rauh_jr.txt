mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
petition
for
certiorari
to
review
a
decision
of
a
full
bench
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
which
had
reversed
a
three-judge
panel.
the
three-judge
panel
had
reversed
petitioner's
conviction
for
contempt
of
congress
in
the
full
bench
with
the
two
judges
dissenting,
reversed
the
panel
and
affirmed
petitioner's
conviction.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
sir,
but
it
is
substantially
identical
with
the
dissenting
opinion
and
there
is
a
footnote
in
the
dissenting
opinion
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
stating
that
it
is
substantially
identical.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
sir
and
the
dissenting
opinion
of
judge
baskin
became
the
majority
opinion
after
the
reversal.
the
essential
facts
are
these.
petitioner
was
subpoenaed
to
appear
and
did
appear
before
the
house
committee
on
un-american
activities
in
april
1954.
now,
before
he
appeared,
two
witnesses
had
appeared
before
that
committee,
one
several
years
before
and
one
recently
before
and
had
identified
him
as
a
communist
during
the
middle
1940's.
now,
at
the
opening
of
his
hearing
which
was
in
washington
d.c.
on
april
1954,
the
chairman
simply
--
of
the
committee
simply
announced,
“we're
here
in
continuation
of
what
happened
to
chicago.”
now,
that
was
a
hearing
some
six
weeks
before.
now
that,
at
the
outset
of
the
hearing
in
chicago,
the
chairman
of
the
committee
had
made
a
lengthy
pro-formal
--
formal
opening
statement
listing
past
and
pending
bills
and
giving
the
general
aims
and
purposes
of
the
committee
in
this
hearing
and
there
will
be
more
of
that
opening
statement
later.
now,
at
the
hearing,
petitioner
testified
freely
and
fully
about
himself.
he
affirmed
his
cooperation
with
the
communist
party
during
the
years,
1942
to
1947.
1942
to
1947,
he
said
“i
cooperated
with
them.
i
was
so
close
to
him
that
some
of
them
might
honestly
have
believed
i
was
part
of
them,
but
i
didn't
join.”
he
testified
that
in
1947,
the
middle
of
1947
at
a
convention
of
his
union
which
was
then
the
farm
equipment
workers,
he
got
in
such
a
bitter
battle
with
the
communist
over
the
question
of
compliance
with
the
non-communist
oath
provisions
of
taft-hartley
this
cooperation
was
over
and
from
then
on,
he's
been
an
anti-communist.
but
after
telling
them
all
about
himself,
then
it
has
come
to
all
witnesses
before
the
house
of
un-american
activities
committee,
he
was
asked
the
name
certain
other
persons
who
in
--
in
the
mid-1940's
had
been
members
of
the
communist
party
and
it
was
here
and
here
only
that
petitioner
bought.
now,
on
page
85
of
the
record
is
his
statement.
“when
he
refused
to
say
whether
certain
persons
had
been
members
of
the
communist
party
in
the
middle
1940's,
i
would
like
to
get
one
thing
perfectly
clear
mr.
chairman,
i
am
not
going
to
plead
the
firth
amendment.”
i
would
just
like
to
--
to
interpolate
here
for
the
courts,
for
the
clarity
of
the
position
and
the
problem
of
the
petitioner.
at
the
time
he
made
his
decision
on
what
to
do
before
this
committee,
he
had
only
three
alternatives.
this
court's
decision
in
the
rogers
case,
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
do
what
might
very
well
have
been
his
first
choice.
namely,
to
have
told
all
about
himself
and
pleaded
the
fifth
amendment
when
it
came
to
informing
on
others.
that
is
not
as
he
was
informed
a
legal
possibility.
the
fifth
amendment
is
not
available.
the
self-incrimination
provisions
are
not
available,
if
you
have
already
incriminated
yourself
by
the
--
under
the
(inaudible)
case.
so,
his
choices,
with
that
choice
ruled
out
were
these
three,
he
could
have
known
all
the
information
from
the
committee
by
pleading
the
fifth
amendment
as
to
his
own
personal
activities
and
also
as
to
the
others
and
it
is
this
court's
decisions
in
the
(inaudible)
cases.
it
was
clear
he
had
this
right
or
he
could
have
told
everything.
namely,
he
could
have
told
all
about
himself
and
he
could
have
named
the
others.
as
to
this,
he
would
then
been
an
informer,
the
worst
crime
he
can
commit
among
his
own
associates.
and
the
third,
the
third
is
to
tell
about
yourself,
which
he
was
not
ashamed
of
it,
which
he
was
willing
and
did
do
and
then
say,
this
is
what
he
did
choose.
this
was
the
third
alternative.
“you
don't
have
power
to
force
me
to
name
the
other
persons,
because
it's
beyond
your
jurisdiction
and
because
you
are
engaged
in
exposure.”
and
this
is
what
he
said
then
as
he
chose
the
alternative.
“i
would
like
to
get
one
thing
perfectly
clear
mr.
chairman.
i
am
not
going
to
plead
the
fifth
amendment,
but
i
refuse
to
answer
certain
questions
that
i
believe
are
outside
the
proper
scope
of
your
committee's
activities.
i
will
answer
any
questions
which
this
committee
puts
to
be
about
myself.
i
will
also
answer
questions
about
those
persons
whom
i
knew
to
be
members
to
the
communist
party
and
whom
i
believed
still
are.
i
will
not,
however,
answer
any
questions
with
respect
to
others
with
whom
i
associated
in
the
past,”
then
i
skip.
“i
do
not
believe
that
such
questions
are
relevant
to
the
work
of
this
committee
nor
do
i
believe
that
this
committee
has
the
right
to
undertake
the
public
exposure
of
persons
because
of
their
past
activities.”
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that's
correct,
sir,
i
did.
it
is
narrower
than
i
stated.
now,
when
petitioner
finished
his
statement,
the
committee
did
not
contradict
his
assertion
that
they
were
engaged
in
public
exposure.
the
chairman
simply
paraphrased
the
committee's
resolution
and
said,
“answer”.
“petitioner
stuck
to
his
prepared
statement.
they
asked
him
a
numbers
of
30
odd
people.
he
is
stuck
to
his
ground,
but
he
would
not
name
those
in
the
past
who
he
no
longer
felt
were
members
of
the
party.”
here,
the
committee
had
before
him
an
expert
in
communist
activities
in
the
labor
movement.
but
when
he
refused
to
inform
on
these
others
not
one
more
question,
not
one
question
about
communist
techniques
in
the
labor
movement,
he
was
discharged.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
all
in
--
yes.
the
answer
to
your
question
is
--
is
yes.
there
were
no
other
questions
in
the
indictment
except
those
as
to
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
precisely.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
sir.
petitioner
was
cited
and
indicted
on
seven
counts
for
contempt
to
congress.
he
was
tried
without
a
jury
at
the
trial.
petitioner
sought
to
prove
that
the
purpose
of
the
committee
had
been
solely
one
of
exposure,
by
which
i
mean
injurious
publicity
had
been
the
sole
purpose
of
the
committee.
and
if
petitioner
sought
to
prove
this
through
three
avenues
approved.
one,
official
statements
and
reports
of
the
committee
in
the
members
of
the
committee
on
official
business
that
the
un-american
activities
committee
asserts
this
right
of
exposure
independent
of
any
legislative
purpose.
secondly,
that
the
questioning
of
petitioner
and
his
colloquies
with
the
committee
demonstrated
this
purpose
of
exposure.
and
thirdly,
that
the
committee
had
all
the
information
and
sought
that
petitioner
has
filed
and
didn't
even
bother
to
examine.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
i
must
admit
that
the
--
that
the
committee,
that
two
of
these
two
people
who
have
identified
him
had
also
identified
most
of
them.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
there
is
nothing
said
by
that.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
sir.
that
goes
with
no
such
reference
at
all.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
precisely.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
precisely.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
he
was
asked
the
question
with
about
25
names
in
it
and
he
pulled
one
name
out
of
it
and
said,
“that
fellow
is
still
is
and
i
won't
answer
as
to
the
rest.”
now,
the
trial
court
held
that
all
of
the
petitioner's
evidence
and
proof
of
exposure
was
irrelevant,
apparently
and
i
say
apparently
because
the
district
judge
did
not
give
his
reasons
for
any
of
his
rulings
nor
for
the
conviction.
apparently,
accepting
a
prosecuting
attorney's
position
which
i
could
phrase
as
follows,
“fifth
amendment
or
nothing,
it
is
the
position
of
the
government
in
the
trial
courts,”
although
i
am
not
quite
as
clear
that
it
is
their
position
here,
although
it
is
quite
close
to
it
that
the
only
defense
to
a
contempt
of
congress
indictment
in
this
area
of
communism
is
the
fifth
amendment.
that
was
squarely
stated
by
the
prosecuting
attorney
in
the
lower
court
here
and
it
was
apparently
and
i
say
apparently
because
the
judge
did
not
say
anything
except,
“your
evidence
is
excluded,”
the
disposition
of
the
court
below.
now,
the
petitioner
was
convicted.
he
appealed
as
i
said
before
of
the
three-judge
panel,
the
conviction
was
reversed,
then
there
was
a
reversal
of
the
reversal
and
the
conviction
was
affirmed
62.
those
are
believed
are
the
essential
facts.
the
first
point
we
lay
before,
your
honors,
i
do
not
believe
we
need
to
elaborate
on
to
any
great
extent.
it's
made
in
our
initial
and
our
reply
brief
and
it
is
that
the
power
to
investigate
does
not
encompass
exposure
unrelated
to
a
legislative
purpose.
and
when
i
say
i
don't
believe
we
need
to
pause
long
on
this
point,
i
say
it
because
it
is
an
obvious
corollary
of
the
doctrine
of
separation
of
powers.
and
also,
because
i
do
not
understand
the
government
to
--
seriously
to
contest
the
proposition,
that
exposure
--
for
exposure
sake
is
beyond
detail.
now,
the
proposition,
it
seems
to
me
is
simple.
the
legislative
function
is
to
determine
general
standards
of
conduct.
the
executive
function
is
to
prosecute
for
infractions
of
the
general
standard
of
conduct
and
the
judicial
function
is
to
determine
guilt
when
a
congressional
committee
determined
a
standard
of
conduct
to
debar,
namely
past
membership
in
the
communist
party
and
then,
through
exposure
by
calling
him
before
them,
prosecutes
him,
forces
him
to
answer.
and
then
finally,
through
the
determination
of
guilt
by
their
accusation
of
him
and
their
reports
about
him,
keeps
injurious
publicity
upon
him,
they
are
combining
all
three
functions
in
one.
i
would
suggest
to
your
honors,
we
use
the
different
example
in
our
brief
but
supposed
we
went
back
to
the
1910s,
during
the
period
when
mr.
mann
was
considering
and
bringing
before
the
congress,
the
mann
act.
supposed
at
that
time,
he
had
felt,
“i
cannot
get
a
bill
through
congress.”
suppose
he
had
felt
that
president
wilson,
i
believed
it
was,
would
not
have
sign
such
a
bill
and
indeed
he
didn't
have
the
votes
to
pass
it
over
a
veto,
but
he
says
to
himself.
“i
can
accomplish
the
same
thing
by
simply
calling
before
the
--
our
committee.
i'll
get
a
right
to
investigate
and
i'll
call
before
the
committee
everybody
i
can
find
who
i
have
any
suspicion
may
pass
in
the
past
have
violated
the
mann
act,
what
is
now
the
mann
act.”
in
other
words,
supposed
mr.
mann
had
sought
to
do
by
injurious
publicity
exactly
what
they
did
by
legislation.
i
think
this
court
would
have
had
no
hesitancy
in
striking
that
down
as
an
effort
to
accomplish
without
legislation
to
substitute
purposes
of
legislation.
now,
the
government
does
make
two
tangential
points
about
this
so
i'd
like
to
refer
to,
although
as
i
--
i
honestly
believe
they
are
not
in
--in
wholehearted
disagreement
on
this
point.
first,
the
government
refers
to
the
quote,
“informing
function”
of
congress
as
one
that
has
been
written
up
in
the
books,
although
admittedly,
not
in
the
books
of
this
court.
now,
that
of
course
phrase,
“informing
function”
goes
back
to
president
wilson
at
the
time
he
wrote
his
great
text
on
the
subject
of
congress,
but
president
wilson's
reference
to
the
informing
function
was
to
something
different.
it
was
to
the
internal
debates
and
give
and
take
within
congress.
indeed,
president
wilson's
illustration
of
the
informing
function
was
the
question
and
answer
period
in
the
house
of
commons
about
as
far
away
from
the
idea
of
compulsory
testimony
being
used
for
the
informing
function
as
possible.
now,
it
is
true
when
the
government
cites
a
number
of
articles
at
page
55
of
its
brief
that
president
wilson's
informing
function
has
carried
over
in
some
articles,
never
ratified
by
this
court
to
suggest
an
informing
function
in
another
category.
and
here,
it
is
in
the
supervision
of
public
administration.
now,
i
do
not
have
to
carry
the
burden
before
this
court
to
argue
that
there
is
or
isn't
such
an
informing
function
when
it
comes
to
the
supervision
of
the
executive
branch
in
the
administration
of
law
in
america,
because
we
do
not
have
that
case
here.
here,
we
do
not
have
the
informing
function
of
a
supervision
of
public
administration.
here,
we
have
the
informing
function
if
you
seek
to
call
it
that.
here,
we
have
the
exposure,
injurious
publicity
applied
to
a
private
citizen.
now,
the
government
also
in
--
in
another
tangential
point
refers
to
statutes
such
as
the
lobbying
act
and
the
public
utilities
holding
company
act,
where
congress,
by
statute
has
required
publicity
as
a
method
of
regulation.
and
i'm
prepared
to
rest
our
case
on
the
distinction
between
congress
passing
a
statute
requiring
the
publicizing
of
information
and
a
committee
of
congress,
maybe
a
single
congressman
seeking
to
accomplish
that
same
result
through
the
subpoena
power.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
when
you
have
a
statute,
it's
general
in
application,
it's
prospective
in
effect
and
it's
definite
in
operation.
when
you
have
congressional
committee
seek
to
operate
both
as
legislature
judge
and
jury,
then
the
exposure
becomes
discriminatory
in
application,
retroactive
in
effect
as
it
is
here
and
arbitrary
in
procedure.
i
do
not
think
it
is
too
much
to
say,
but
what
we
have
in
our
case
here
and
what
the
house
committee's
practices
have
been
is
that
lawmaker
investigator,
prosecutor,
judge
and
jury,
all
five
reside
in
the
one
subcommittee
and
may
reside
as
it
has
in
the
past
in
one
individual.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that's
point
two
and
i'm
--
i'm
really
right
there
if
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
may
i
please.
i
just
think
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
there
is
one
further
observation
on
the
distinction
between
the
congress
engaging
by
statute
requiring
the
publicizing
of
certain
information.
maybe
i'm
blabbering
this
too
much,
but
i
just
like
to
point
out
that
it
does
seem
to
me
that
it
was
the
blurring
of
this
distinction
in
the
past
10
years,
which
has
caused
the
concern
over
the
action
of
congressional
committee
to
which
this
court
has
adverted
in
both
the
rumely
and
quinn
cases.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
certainly
not,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
think
it's
--
it's
not
only
profitable.
i
think
the
entire
separation
of
powers
depends
upon
making
this
light
of
inquiry.
however,
i
must
say
that
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
just
said
i
may
have
deliberated
too
much
the
--
what
i
wanted
as
the
hypothesis
in
which
i
would
make
my
argument
that
there
was
exposure,
the
fact
that
no
such
power
exist.
i
--
i
now
pass
to
the
point
two
of
petitioner's
argument.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
maybe
i
should
have
simply
assumed
that
that
was
the
law
that
the
--
that
i
couldn't
find,
just
the
hornbrook
case
to
give
me
that,
so
i
thought
i'd
better
argue
with
it.
so,
we
pass
to
point
two
of
our
argument,
which
government
does
seriously
contest
and
that
is
that
the
purpose
of
the
committee
here
in
interrogating
petitioner
was
to
expose
him
and
his
former
associates
to
scorn
and
ridicule.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
i'm
not
bringing
to
this
court
a
closed
case
because
i
believe
that
there
were
closed
case
about
whether
it
was
exposure
and
legislation.
a
certain
deference
to
congress
might
very
well
warrant
that
all
doubts
be
resolved
in
their
favor.
we
bring
to
this
case
--
this
court
a
case
that
if
we
haven't
shown
this
is
exposure
for
exposure's
sake,
i
honestly
believe
it
can't
be
shown.
if
your
honors
will
read
the
questioning
of
petitioner
from
pages
70
to
90
of
this
record,
you
will
not
find
one
question
of
any
possible
relation
to
any
possible
legislation.
now,
i
quite
agree
with
justice
frankfurter's
implication
of
this
question
that
you
may
have
to
ask
a
lot
of
questions
that
are
unrelated
to
a
specific
bill
in
order
to
find
out
what
your
legislation
ought
to
be.
but
when
--
but
here,
by
both
what
they
asked
petitioner
and
by
what
they
didn't
ask
him,
it's
perfectly
clear
that
all
they
wanted
from
him
were
names,
names,
names
of
human
beings
to
determine
whether
in
fact
they
have
been
communist
in
1945.
once,
he
said,
“i
will
not
give
you
those
names.
i
will
not
tell
you
where
these
people
were,”
they
get
rid
of
him.
they
told
him
they
didn't
want
to
ask
him
anything.
now,
they
didn't
have
before
him
a
man
without
knowledge
in
this
field.
i
submit
that
mr.
watkins
is
an
expert.
he
had
cooperated
with
him
and
he
had
broken
with
them
and
what
had
he
broken
with
them
over?
compliance
with
the
very
statute,
namely
the
taft-hartley
act
non-communist
previsions,
which
if
there
was
to
be
further
legislation
would
have
to
be
amended
or
changed
or
--
or
additional
provisions
provided,
not
a
question.
and
when
he
said
to
them
as
i
read
the
statement,
“you
do
not
have
the
power
to
engage
in
this
exposure,”
their
answer
was
a
quotation,
a
paraphrase
of
the
authorization
prevision
and
as
answer
you
are
directed
to
answer
the
question.
in
other
words,
the
--
the
questioning
is
clear
and
therefore,
i
may
have
again
unduly
complicated
my
case
by
seeking
to
provide
so
much
additional
evidence
of
the
--
the
purpose
of
exposure.
in
other
words,
we
have
in
the
record
and
in
our
brief
pages
after
pages
of
proof
that
the
house
un-american
activities
committee
asserts
this
independent
power
of
exposure.
now,
it
did
seem
to
me
that
that
was
relevant
evidence
and
so
to
as
judge
edgerton,
that
the
fact
that
a
committee
asserts
a
power
can
be
considered
in
determining
whether
it
was
exercising
that
assertive
power
at
a
given
time.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
there
--
i
would
say
that
it
was
--
was
an
hour
about.
i
would
say
there
were
intermissions,
but
i
must
say
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
sir,
but
you
see
that
most
of
that
was
--
was
asking
him
to
--
to
tell
about
himself.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
it
was
about
five
minutes
at
the
end
when
this
comes
up
of
completeness.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
they
read
him
what
rumsey
and
spencer,
the
two
previous
witnesses
had
said
about
him
and
then
probed
on
whether
that
was
true
about
him,
then
they
asked
him
about
the
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that
was
consistent
with
his
position
that
he
was
not
ashamed
to
tell
about
himself,
but
he
would
not
turn
informant.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
sir,
and
he
was
excused.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
precisely.
now,
getting
back
to
this
background
material
of
the
house
un-american
activities
committee,
the
government's
position
is
that
your
honors
cannot
consider
anything,
except
the
authorizing
resolution
and
the
questioning
of
petitioner.
now,
i
am
willing
to
rest
our
case
on
the
questioning
of
petitioner,
but
i
do
not
see
on
what
theory
you
should
deny
yourselves,
evidence
of
an
assertive
power
by
the
committee
if
a
man
says
he‘s
going
to
murder
someone
else.you
can
consider
that
in
relation
to
the
fact
that
there
was
a
death
a
little
later.
i
do
not
see
that
there
is
any
difference
in
this
situation.
nevertheless,
if
your
honor,
if
--
if
the
questioning
is
as
clear
as
i
feel,
this
additional
assertive
power
would
not
be
necessary,
but
i
do
feel
that
your
honors
are
--
are
free
to
examine
that
and
it
does
corroborate
and
it
sort
of
sets
a
background
that
a
man
has
claimed
he
has
the
right
of
exposure,
seems
to
me
to
set
a
background
when
you
find
questioning
which
seems
so
clearly
on
its
face
to
be
exposure.
now,
what
does
the
government
say
in
opposition
to
this
overwhelming
proof
of
exposure
that
we
have
presented?
well,
distinguished
solicitor
general
concedes
as
i
think
he
must
that
the
government,
that
the
committee
was
not
interested
in
communist
techniques
in
the
labor
movement,
that
they
had
no
interest
in
how
the
communists
were
working.
they
come
up
in
this
court
for
the
first
time
with
the
following
proposition.
what
the
committee
wanted
to
know
was
the
mathematically
exact
number
of
communists
in
the
labor
movement
in
the
middle
1940s
to
be
determined
by
naming
and
numbering
every
one
of
the
players.
now,
that
is
the
position
as
i
understand
it
of
the
government
here
that
the
committee's
purpose
was
to
find
the
exact
number
of
communists
in
middle
1940s
by
getting
the
names
of
each
one
and
holding
them.
now,
i
sympathize.
all
i'm
asking
with
the
government
that
they
had
a
hard
problem
of
finding
a
legislative
purpose
from
questioning
like
this,
but
i
do
say
that
it
attacks
all
our
ability
to
believe,
to
think
that
a
committee
was
seeking
to
make
a
retroactive
census
of
the
communists
in
the
middle
1940's.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
yes
sir.
they
had
the
names
from
rumsey
and
spencer,
but
i'm
not
suggesting
the
committee
that
that's
a
proof
that
they
were
in
fact
communists.
what
the
committee
was
doing
here
was
really
trying
to
make
a
legislative
trial
of
each
one
of
these
people
to
determine
whether
they
were
communist.
they
had
the
names,
but
that
alone
doesn't
determine
whether
they
were
communist
or
not,
for
example
mr.
watkins
himself,
they
had
his
name.now,
he
says
he
testified
under
oath
he
wasn't
a
communist.
what
they
were
doing
was
taking
all
these
names
and
then
running
a
sort
of
a
legislative
trial
over
each
one
these.
now,
the
government
doesn't
suggest,
if
your
honor
please,
how
this
mathematically
exact
number
of
communists
in
the
mid-1940's
in
the
labor
movement
would
help
them
with
any
legislation,
that
they
say
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
committee,
was
to
find
this
mathematically
perfect
number.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
it
--
it
would
indicate
the
magnitude
of
the
problem
back
in
1945,
but
the
committee,
however,
never
suggested
that
that
was
their
purpose
and
indeed
and
i
think
this
is
--
this
would
really
to
settle
the
point.
indeed,
the
committee
didn't
say
to
mr.
watkins,
“how
many
communists
were
there
then?”
they
didn't
say
to
mr.
watkins,
“can
you
name
any
other
communists
there?”
they
clearly
were
not
engaged
in
trying
to
find
this
retroactive
sense.
of
course,
they
could
have
got
it
from
the
f.b.i.,
i
suppose.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
you're
quite
right,
if
your
honor
please
and
just
how
long
ago
we
had
that,
i'm
not
very
clear,
but
nowhere
as
it
suggest
that
how
the
mathematically
precise
number
of
communists
and
labor
movement
in
middle
1940s
will
help
you
pass
legislation
in
1954,
when
you
don't
even
asked
about
the
statutes
that
either
intervened
and
when
the
middle
1940s
where
a
period
of
what
you
might
call
a
--
a
friendliness
towards
the
communist
movement
and
then
on
middle
1950s
of
the
exact
opposite.
it
was
trying
to
find
the
census
at
time
which
wouldn't
be
helpful
to
determine
your
action
at
a
--
at
a
later
date.
and
as
i
say,
the
committee
never
suggested
this
was
their
purpose.
their
action
show
it
wasn't
their
purpose
because
they
didn't
ask
him
how
many
there
were.
so
--
well,
to
come
to
the
government's
other
contention
of
why
this
was
an
exposure,
it
is
a
fact
and
i
call
your
honor's
attention
to
the
opening
statement
of
the
chairman
of
the
committee
at
page
43
and
44
of
the
record.
now,
in
a
two-page
lengthy
opening
statement,
this
was
six
weeks
before
petitioner
testified
in
washington.
this
was
the
opening
statement
in
chicago
six
weeks
before,
but
in
the
opening
statement
in
washington,
they
refer
back
to
this.
this
is
a
--
what
you
might
call
a
gently
causing
statement
about
the
past
activities
of
the
--
of
the
committee.
and
there
is
a
reference
in
this
statement
on
--
in
this
opening
statement
on
page
44
to
a
bill.
this
is
the
second
paragraph
on
page
44,
to
a
bill
which
would
deprive
communist
infiltrated
labor
unions
of
the
facilities
of
the
mlrb.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
that
bill
was
enacted
or
rather
another
bill
was
enacted
but
on
that
same
subject.
now,
here
is
an
opening
statement
telling
all
about
your
activities.
immediately
thereafter,
they
go
into
all
other
sponsor
activities,
communist
at
farms,
communists
in
the
government
and
all
other
activities.
and
then,
they
come
to
this
fellow,
watkins,
and
they
asked
him
questions
that
haven't
any
relation
whatever
to
this
bill.
and
yet,
they
say
because
this
bill
was
mentioned,
therefore,
a
question
that
has
no
relationship
whatever
to
the
bill
is
in
some
way
to
be
protected.
now,
it
maybe,
it
may
very
well
be
that
if
the
bill
haven't
been
mentioned,
the
questioning
still
could
have
been
about
something
that
might
produce
legislation.
but
the
fact
that
the
bill
is
mentioned,
if
the
questioning
is
wholly
unrelated
in
any
way
to
the
possibilities
of
that
bill,
the
bill
itself
is
not
determinative
or
relevant.
indeed,
i
think
the
best
way
i
could
put
it
is
that
the
dependency
of
legislation
is
not
a
hunting
license
to
engage
in
exposure
where
the
questions
have
no
relation
to
that
legislation
and
there
it
seems
to
me
again
the
--
the
case
rest.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
would
have
made
very
little
in
that.
i
think
mr.
watkins
could
rightly
have
said,
“i
don't
understand
the
relationship
between
the
two.”
if
one
has
been
given
him,
i
think
maybe
he
would
have
had
to
answer,
but
it's
significant
that
when
you
have
this
man
who
had
been
in
the
very
peak
of
a
fight
over
this
kind
of
a
statute,
they
weren't
interested
in
anything
about
it.
and
therefore,
i
say
it's
perfectly
clear
that
they
weren't
interested
in
the
bill.
it
seems
to
me,
if
your
honors
please,
if
we
--
that
exposure
--
it
probably
is
a
--
in
many
cases,
it's
going
to
be
a
hard
thing
to
prove.
there's
always
the
possibility
of
retroactive
rationalization
and
that's
exactly
what
we've
had
here.
but
now,
the
committee
didn't
tell
us
they
had
any
such
purpose.
this
wasn't
the
purpose
in
the
lower
court.
indeed,
i'd
like
to
call
your
honor's
attention
that
this
new
suggestion
of
the
government
that
they
were
trying
to
get
a
retroactive
census
of
the
names
of
every
communist
in
the
mid-1940s
in
the
labor
movement
was
as
late
as
their
brief
and
opposition
only
a
hypothetical
possibility.
on
page
5
of
our
reply
brief,
i
quote
from
the
government's
brief
in
opposition
where
the
government
says,
“if
the
committee
had
the
additional
and
more
general
way
of
ascertaining
the
number
of
communists
at
a
particular
period
on
a
recent
history,
that
too
would
be
a
valid
subject
of
inquiry.”
in
other
words,
what
the
government
now
says
is
the
subject
of
inquiry.
they
had
this
latest
brief
in
our
position
simply
suggest
it
was
a
hypothetical
possibility
as
to
the
subject
of
inquiry.
well,
if
your
honors
please,
it
seems
to
be
that
--
that
we
have
shown
a
purpose
of
exposure
and
that
in
light
with
your
honor,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
suggested
himself
the
--
on
the
constitutional
aspect
of
this,
that
would
end
the
case.
i
personally
was
prepared
to
rest
the
case
on
those
two
points.
however,
i
remember
the
discomfiture
of
counsel
in
peters
v.
hobby
for
not
arguing
the
narrower
grounds
of
a
--
i
wish
the
court
might
rest
a
decision
and
seeking
to
be
put
in
the
position
of
seeking
to
force
a
constitutional
issue
and
i
have
no
desire
to
get
in
that
position.
and
therefore,
we
have
--
we
do
contend,
if
your
honors
please,
that
the
--
these
questions
are
not
within
the
authorizing
resolution,
that
of
course
being
a
narrower
ground
of
decision
than
a
serious
constitutional
issue
of
separation
of
powers
that
we
have
raised.
now,
there
are
two
possible
grounds
of
interpretation
of
the
congressional
--
authorizing
resolution,
which
would
take
the
questioning
of
petitioner
outside
of
that
resolution.
first,
that
there
was
no
intent
by
congress
to
give
the
committee
a
power
of
exposure,
and
if
your
honors
will
examine
the
resolution,
it's
in
the
record.
it's
in
the
briefs
of
many
places.
it's
in
our
brief
at
page
4
of
our
--
of
the
initial
white
petitioner's
brief.
you
will
notice
that
the
purpose
that
deals
with
the
extent
character
and
objects
of
un-american
activities
and
subversive
propaganda.
and
three,
all
other
questions
in
relation
thereto
that
would
aid
congress
in
any
necessary
remedial
legislation.
it
does
seem
to
us
three
that
those
words
in
any
necessary
remedial
legislation
are
--
cover
both
one
and
two
as
well
as
three
and
therefore,
there
was
no
power
of
exposure
given.
and
therefore,
if
our
proof
is
correct
on
the
exposure
point,
your
honors
would
--
could
by
interpretation
of
the
resolution
accomplish
the
same
result
as
i
have
argued
under
the
constitution.
secondly,
however,
and
i
think
it's
even
clearer
if
your
honors
please,
this
--
to
summarize
this
resolution
in
a
sentence,
it's
a
power
to
investigate
un-american
and
subversive
propaganda
activities.
now,
where
in
subversive
and
un-american
propaganda
activity,
you
find
an
authority
to
ask
a
man
to
name
certain
persons
as
communists
in
1945?
in
other
words,
it
seems
to
us
that
on
that
narrowest
ground,
we
are
outside
of
the
resolution.
now,
i
would
be
less
than
candid
if
i
did
not
say
that
that
over
simplifies
the
problem,
because
for
the
last
20
years,
the
house
committee
has
been
doing
what
we
are
here
complaining
of
to
the
public
knowledge
of
everyone
and
to
the
knowledge
of
the
members
of
the
house
who
have
reenacted
the
resolution,
who
have
given
them
appropriations
and
who
--
one
could
argue
have
ratified
what
they
have
been
doing.
and
it
was
because
of
the
ratification
point
that
i
preferred
to
rely
on
the
constitutional
argument.
but
again,
referring
to
our
duty
to
find
the
narrowest
ground,
i
would
say
to
your
honors
that
there
is
a
serious
question
whether
congress
could
ratify
so
broad
a
change
in
the
meaning
of
the
resolution
as
it's
necessary
to
cover
the
situation
here.
in
other
words,
there
are
decisions
of
this
court
that
what
you
can
ratify
is
only
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
a
resolution
and
that
this
interpretation
to
broaden
the
words,
propaganda
and
propaganda
activities
to
cover
identification
of
all
communists
in
mid-1940s,
let
us
say
is
beyond
a
reasonable
broadening
of
those
words
and
i
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no
sir.
i
was
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no.
i
was
referring,
sir,
to
the
tax
cases
where
words
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
i
was
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
--
i
agree.
i
was
simply
using
those
cases
to
show
they
don't
go
this
far,
your
honor,
since
they
know
that
the
only
thing
you
can
ratify
is
the
reasonably
--
is
a
reasonable
interpretation,
whereas
i'm
suggesting
that
this
goes
beyond
that.
and
therefore,
if
your
honor
should
agree
that
the
ratification
has
not
occurred
here,
then
i
would
suggest
that
that
is
narrowest
ground
of
decision
on
which
this
case
can
turn.
now,
to
turn
briefly
for
just
a
moment
to
the
protections
of
the
first
amendment.
if
as
we
contend
most
strongly
and
certainly,
there
was
--
the
committee
was
engaged
in
the
activity
of
exposure,
there
was
also
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment,
because
if
its
purpose
was
exposure,
then
there
is
no
possible
legislative
need
to
justify
the
obvious
repressive
effect
of
the
activities
of
the
committee.
but
i
am
assuming
here
in
arguing
the
first
amendment
point
that
the
committee
had
a
legislative
purpose,
but
i
have
been
found
to
be
wrong
in
arguing
that
it
did
not
have
and
that
it
had
a
legislative
purpose.
and
we
nevertheless
contend
strongly
that
this
was
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
legislative
purpose
is
not
legislative
need.
you
still
must
balance
the
repressive
effects
of
the
activities
of
the
committee
on
speech
and
association
against
the
need
for
the
legislation.
i
--
i
take
it
as
what
the
rumely
case
has
told
us.
now,
this
court
has
told
us
there
must
be
a
way,
but
it
has
not
told
us
the
standards
for
weighing
and
that
will
have
to
be
worked
out
as
we
go
along.
i
take
it
that
the
clear
and
present
danger
test
hardly
fits
exactly
this
kind
of
a
weighing
situation,
but
it
does
remind
us
of
the
importance
of
protecting
the
right
of
speech
and
association
from
congressional
activities.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
i
thought
i
can
rest
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
can
rest
it
on
brief,
sir
on
page
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
sir.
we
summarized
this
from
pages
41
to
58
of
our
brief.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
mr.
velde,
the
chairman
of
the
committee,
i'm
now
quoting
--
i'm
now
looking
for
judge
edgerton's
dissent
that
that
mr.
velde,
the
chairman
of
the
committee
in
the
83rd
congress
who
presided
the
watkins
hearing
cited
in
another
hearing,
“we
feel
that
we
have
a
duty
and
that
duty
has
been
imposed
upon
by
congress
not
only
to
report
to
the
people
for
the
purpose
of
remedial
legislation,
but
to
inform
the
people
who
elected
us
about
subversive
activities.”
now,
there
is
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
sir.
well,
now,
i'm
hearing
before
the
committee
on
un-american
activities.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
sir.
the
government
suggests
that
these
are
a
lot
of
speeches.
these
are
all
reports
and
here
are
on
--
we
did
include
some
speeches,
but
the
bulk
of
it
are
reports
and
hearings
and
statements
on
the
board
of
congress
in
the
capacity
of
the
commerce,
but
i
do
suggest
that
i
--
we
have
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
made
an
overwhelming
showing
of
this
on
pages
41
to
58
of
our
brief.
and
back
to
the
question
of
the
first
amendment,
if
your
honors
please,
what
we
have
to
weigh
here
is
the
repressive
effect
of
the
committee
against
the
need
for
the
legislation.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
the
repressive
effect
is
clear.
to
call
a
man
before
a
committee
and
humiliate
him
into
being
an
informer
and
to
take
out
all
of
his
past,
it's
a
--
it's
a
public
humiliation
for
past
exercise
of
speech
and
association.
it's
also
a
prior
restraint
on
himself
and
on
others
for
the
future.
and
what
need
is
asserted
to
say
that
this
repressive
effect
should
be
allowed
by
this
court
that
they
wanted
to
make
a
retroactive
census
of
communist
at
a
different
period
in
our
history
when
that
very
activity
was
not
considered
wrongful
and
get
that
retroactive
census
in
order.
that's
the
need
to
be
weighed
against
this
repressive
effect.
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
there
is
no
way
that
that
can
be
balanced
anyway,
except
in
the
direction
of
freedom.
and
finally,
we
argue
that
this
resolution
is
too
vague
and
indefinite
to
stand
under
the
cases
that
hold
that
a
defendant
has
a
right
to
a
reasonably
and
ascertainable
standard
of
guilt
before
he
maybe
prosecuted.
what
this
investigation
says
--
what
this
-
or
resolution
says
is
that
the
committee
has
the
authority
to
investigate
un-american
and
subversive
propaganda
activities.
was
petitioner
to
know
that
when
he
was
asked
about
people
in
1945,
whether
they
were
members
of
the
party
that
that
was
propaganda,
that
that
was
subversive,
that
that
was
un-american,
i
would
challenge
anybody
to
suggest
that
different
people
sitting
in
that
chair
would
not
reach
different
conclusion.
and
what
does
the
government
say?
they
say
that
all
resolutions
of
congress
are
too
vague
to
meet
the
standard.
they
rely
on
the
fact
that
if
you
hold
them
up
to
the
standard
of
a
--
of
a
criminal
statute,
then
they
will
not
be
able,
congress
will
not
be
able
to
do
its
job.
i
suggest
they
forget
that
in
the
house
--
house
of
representatives
today,
there
are
only
three
committees
that
exercise
this
power.
whatever
vagueness
you
may
want
to
have
in
congress
for
internal
functioning
of
the
body
is
one
thing,
but
when
they
seek
to
use
the
subpoena
power
and
to
prosecute
people
for
violation,
certainly,
they
must
live
up
to
the
standards
of
the
(inaudible)
grocery
case.
it
is
one
thing
if
they
call
a
witness
before
the
bar
of
the
house
when
he
gets
a
last
clear
chance
to
answer.
but
when
they
use
their
criminal
prosecutions,
the
criminal
process
to
prosecute
a
man,
then
he
must
have
a
reasonably
ascertainable
standard
of
guilt.
finally,
there
is
involved
in
the
case,
the
same
grand
jury
point
that
(inaudible)
when
we
have
briefed
it
fully.
i
would
prefer
because
i
do
not
believe
the
court
would
likely
get
to
this
point
to
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
provision
on
the
subcommittee
is
that
whoever
is
in
the
room
is
a
subcommittee.
that
is
actually
shown
by
the
record
here
that
whoever
happens
to
be
present
at
even
after
recess,
the
chairman
says
at
this
point
is
a
subcommittee.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
i
agree.
i
was
only
saying
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
that
neither
subcommittee,
because
there
were
two,
actually
here,
nor
this
committee
has
ever
suggested
the
relevance
of
the
questions
we
have
been
asked.
now,
i
would
suggest
to
your
honors
that
the
solicitor
general's
very
clear
statement
here
indicates
very
dangerous
of
retroactive
rationalization
that
i
have
referred
to
before.
i
was
at
the
committee
in
the
trial
court,
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
read
the
briefs
in
this
case,
that
suggested
that
rumsey's
testimony
was
connected
with
our
testimony
in
the
sense
that
that
sentence
about
propaganda
was
ever
put
to
us,
has
never
been
mentioned
in
any
document
in
this
case
until
we
came
in
this
court
and
heard
this,
this
morning.
in
others
words,
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
the
very
point
i
was
making
has
been
demonstrated,
you
can
always
look
for
something
somewhere
that
wasn't
told
to
the
witness
but
that
somebody
else
could
say
might
have
been
relevant,
had
it
been
told
to
the
witness.
now,
maybe
rumsey
and
spencer
testified
two
years
before.
rumsey
testified
six
to
eight
weeks
before
the
witness,
that
suggested
this
witness
was
in
some
way
connected
with
the
subsidy
of
parts
of
that
testimony,
i
do
not
see.
they
didn't
ask
him
one
question
about
any
substantive
thing
they
had
asked
rumsey
and
spencer.
they
only
asked
him
to
name
these
people.
now,
i'd
like
to
answer
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
on
that
--
on
that
point.
i
would
take
--
take
it
was
did
not
--
when
he
denied
the
thing
about
himself,
didn't
he
then
bring
into
question,
the
credibility
of
rumsey
and
spencer
about
these
other
people.
of
course
he
did.
i
--
i
readily
say
that.
but
unless
building
that
list
of
communist
in
the
mid-1940's
was
a
legislative
purpose,
then
he
couldn't
be
required
to
go
into
that.
for
example,
suppose
i
want
to
go
before
the
--
a
committee,
these
were
voluntary
witnesses.
suppose
i
want
to
go
before
the
house
on
american
activities
committee
and
i
want
to
name
everybody
in
this
room
as
communist,
i
can
do
that.
there's
no
way
anybody
can
stop
me.
i
then
have
a
privilege
against
libel
and
slander
in
doing
it
and
then
they
subpoena
my
associate.
there
had
been
no
legislative
purpose
in
my
going
before.
it
had
been
a
clearly
intended
exposure
by
me
and
the
committee.
then
they
subpoena
my
associate
and
they
asked
her
if
all
of
these
people
were
communist,
and
she
says,
"i
would
not.
i
cannot
answer
this.
i
cannot
inform
on
them."
the
fact
that
i
have
been
a
willing
tool
of
the
exposure
of
the
committee
does
not
give
them
a
right
to
subpoena
somebody
else
and
force
them
to
be
a
tool
of
the
committee
to
determine
whether
the
willing
tool
of
exposure
was
in
fact
engaged
in
a
legislative
purpose.
in
other
words,
the
fact
that
rumsey
and
spencer
were
willing
tools
of
the
house
committee
on
the
exposure
point
does
not
make
petitioner
when
he
goes
before
them,
require
to
answer
questions
that
were
asked
for
exposure.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
where
the
solicitor
general
and
i
find
company
is
not
--
not
the
petitioner
had
in
questions
the
credibility
of
rumsey
and
spencer,
of
course
he
had.
although,
i
would
point
out
that
there
is
no
question
of
petitioner's
credibility
in
this
case.
first,
because
of
the
fact
that
it's
a
contempt
case
and
they
did
not
take
any
action
against
him,
and
second,
and
i
would
ask
your
honors
to
look
at
page
59
of
the
government's
brief.
there
is
a
statement
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
beginning
of
the
second
paragraph
on
page
59
which
is
very
important
related
to
this,
a
more
complete
and
candid
statement
of
his,
"that
the
petitioner
passed
political
associations
and
activities
can
hardly
be
imagined.”
now
here,
the
government
is
saying,
"this
fellow
was
willing
to
tell
everything."
of
course
they
said
this
in
order
to
prove
we
didn't
have
a
first
amendment
right.
but
they
said,
you
could
hardly
imagine
a
man
that's
been
more
candid
about
this
and
yet
they
want
to
say,
nevertheless,
he
has
got
to
answer
questions
and
become
a
tool
of
exposure
because
mr.
rumsey
and
spencer
were
willing
to
be
tools
of
exposure.
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
rumsey
and
spencer
could
have
refused
to
answer
those
questions
on
the
same
grounds
that
the
only
purpose
--
the
purpose
made
in
the
government's
brief
was
to
build
a
list
of
communist
in
1945.
if
they
could
have
refused
to
answer
those
questions
because
of
the
ground
of
exposure,
the
fact
that
they
were
a
wiling
tool
of
it
doesn't
make
him
a
necessary
part
of
it.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
i
was
going
to
come
to
that,
sir.
i
think,
your
honors,
settle
that
in
the
rumely
case.
i
do
not
feel
that
the
--
i
feel
the
solicitor
general
is
rearguing
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
rumely
case
and
the
dictum
of
this
court
in
quinn.
if
your
honors
please,
in
the
quinn
case,
in
a
dictum
that
chief
justice
warren
did
refer
to
the
bill
of
rights
as
covering
the
entire
--
as
covering
this
field.
but
i
would
think
that
the
rumely
case
had
some
of
that
matter.
i
don't
think
it
was
enough
for
me
to
reargue
but
i
want
to
answer
the
second
question
you
put
to
the
solicitor
general
if
i
may
and
that
was
about
this
legislation
that
was
passed.
now,
if
your
honor
pleases,
about
the
report
of
that
--
on
that
committee,
i'd
like
to
call
your
attention
to
page
73
of
our
initial
white
brief.
the
committee's
report
on
the
bill,
to
which
the
court
below
refers,
did
not
claim
there
had
been
any
hearings
on
the
bill.
the
minority
reports
stated
categorically
that
no
hearings
had
been
held.
one
of
this
minority,
who
stated
that
no
hearings
had
been
held,
congress
embraced
it
was
present
of
the
petitioner's
interrogation,
it
would
have
been
a
position
and
know
if
the
question
had
been
directed
in
any
way
of
that
amendment.
in
other
words,
this
legislation
was
pending
and
was
inactive,
but
that
doesn't
of
it
--
in
it
of
itself
demonstrate
that
this
questioning
was
related
to
that
legislation.
it
is
only
related
if
you
are
wiling
to
say
or
if
someone
is
willing
to
say
that
they
had
to
know
or
they
had
a
right
to
know
the
exact
number
of
communist
10
years
before
in
order
to
determine
whether
to
pass
a
law
in
a
different
situation
at
a
later
time,
and
when
--
and
this
i
cannot
repeat
too
often,
and
when
the
committee
itself
--
remember
this
is
the
government
saying
what
the
committee
thought,
not
what
the
committee
itself
is
saying
it
thought.
what
the
committee
itself
did,
namely
in
never
asking
this
fellow
how
many
communist
were
in
the
union,
in
never
asking
him
whether
he
could
name
others,
they
never
asking
him
--
they
never
show
the
slightest
indication
in
take
of
--
that
they
were
taking
the
retroactive
census
that
the
government
now
claims
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that's
correct,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
and
then
i'd
say
i
go
from
there
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
to
the
point
that
even
if
they
were
within
the
allowable
relevance
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
in
the
sub
--
sense
of
the
separation
of
power,
there
has
been
no
suggested
need
which
could
anyway
offset
their
oppressive
effect.
and
i
think
here
we
come
and
i
would
like
to
--
i'm
sure
the
solicitor
general
did
not
mean
to
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that
is
precisely
our
point,
and
if
your
honor
please,
i'm
sure
the
solicitor
general
didn't
mean
to
misstate
this
but
i
do
think
it's
important
on
the
question
of
when
we
raised
the
first
amendment
point.
i'm
sorry
but,
we
sure
did
raise
it.
if
you
look
on
page
55
of
the
--
of
our
--
of
the
record,
i
like
to
call
your
honors
attention
to
point
number
14,
in
which
i
say
point
number
14
is
the
first
amendment
argument
that
we
have
made
here.
i
think
we
made
until
the
15
point.
i
am
sure
your
honor
is
familiar
with
it.
the
point
never
passed
on
by
the
supreme
court
and
i
think
the
reason
for
avoiding
it
in
the
rumely
case
is
that
brought
that
narrow
construction.
it
was
up
again
last
monday
with
quinn
and
emspak
cases
were
there
and
it
is
more
than
somewhat
in
this
case.
