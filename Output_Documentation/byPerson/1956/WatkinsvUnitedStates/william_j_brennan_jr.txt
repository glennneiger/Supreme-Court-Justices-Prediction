justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
solicitor,
are
you
suggesting
that
his
denials
of
their
testimony
as
that
testimony
related
to
him
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
may
have
reflected
upon
the
credibility
of
their
testimony
as
to
these
others?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
least
to
a
degree
which
justify
their
pressing
the
same
questions
upon
him?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
did
you
suggest
before
lunch
that
the
legislation
bearing
expressly
upon
infiltration
in
the
labor
unions
followed
by
only
a
few
months
within
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
was
there
was
a
report
of
this
committee
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
which
led
to
that
legislation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
on
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
was
a
report
in
support
of
the
proposed
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
legislation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
going
to
mention
the
relationship
of
these
questions
to
the
investigation
of
propaganda?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor,
assuming
a
legislative
purpose
in
this
question,
what
have
you
to
say
to
mr.
rauh's
point
that
nevertheless
the
first
amendment
stood
as
a
bar
against
they're
being
put
to
watkins?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
hearing?
do
you
mean
the
--
before
the
committee?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
mr.
rauh's
point
was
--
i
maybe
wrong
that
the
right
arising
from
the
first
amendment
is
that
the
witness
be
saved
the
humiliation
of
being
what
at
least
to
him,
is
the
invidious
position
of
being
an
informer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
it
covers
what
maybe
emitted
and
that's
what
maybe
remained
undisclosed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
suggest
then
that
only
the
fifth
amendment
is
their
protection
against
a
refusal
to
speak
if
there
is
a
connection
legislatively
of
the
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
assuming
for
legislative
purposes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
rauh,
in
that
section,
assuming
a
legislative
purpose
for
this.
what
do
you
have
to
say
to
the
solicitor
general's
suggestion
that
the
first
amendment
is
to
protect
when
you
open
your
mouth
but
not
to
keep
it
closed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
it
was
still
--
as
i
pointed
out
that
i
had
raised
it
sir.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
said
first
it
raised
here
and
then
in
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
as
to
the
question
on
raising
it
at
the
hearing,
i
suggest
your
honors
that
if
you
will
look
at
page
85,
we
raised
everything
we
could.
we
--
we
raised
--
we
raised
everything.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
wouldn't
put
it
exactly
that
way.
i
would
only
--
i
would
only
suggest
that
we
did
raise
every
point
of
our
power
and
right
to
suggest
that
you
had
to
use
those
two
words,
particularly
to
this
court
which
has
allowed
the
plea
of
the
fifth
amendment
which
is
a
much
more
specific
thing
which
has
to
be
raised
to
suggest
we
had
to
use
those
exact
words.
i
--
i
rather
doubt
there
was
no
indication
of
any
decision
of
this
court
that
those
exact
words
would
have
happen
to
use.
and
we
certainly
were
trying
to
do
it.
i
have
no
doubt
that
we
did
raise
it
and
we
raised
each
stage
in
the
trial.
now,
in
conclusion
there
is,
i
take
it,
made
your
point
of
deference
to
congress
and
i'm
second
to
--
not
willing
to
be
second
to
the
solicitor
general
in
feeling
that
there
should
a
deference
to
congress
in
this
area.
but
the
problem
arises
when
congress
seeks
to
utilize
the
criminal
processes,
where
an
individual
has
the
right
to
raise
these
points.
now,
mr.
justice
--
the
solicitor
general
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
said,
“yes,
in
the
field
of
communism,
the
only
area
you
can
defend
on
is
the
fifth
amendment.”
now,
i
just
don't
believe
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
hold
anything
like
that
or
that
the
--
or
possibly
could
hold
that.
there
is
a
weighing
under
the
fifth
--
first
amendment
that
is
necessary.
there
is
the
vagueness
that
must
be
considered.
there
is
the
exposure
that
--
that
must
be
considered.
it
seems
to
me
to
say
that
anybody
who
is
ever
in
anyway
got
in
one
foot
anywhere
near
the
communist
movement
has
lost
all
his
rights
against
criminal
prosecution
for
refusing
to
answer
questions
is
to
say
that
if
we
had
taken
one
area
out
of
american
life
and
said
there
and
there
only
there
are
no
defenses
in
refusing
to
answer
questions.
now,
i
suggest
that
your
honors
had
settled
that
in
the
sinclair
case.
i
thought
that
that
had
really
settled
the
point
on
which
this
court
said
it
knows
on
certain
terms
that
the
presumption
of
validity
is
great
but
the
presumption
of
innocence
is
greater.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
exactly
what
we
have
here.
congress
wants
to
require
answers
at
the
bar
of
the
house,
there
are
certain
rights
that
they
have.
i
do
not
have
that
case
before
me.
i
do
not
know
the
extent
of
those
rights.
but
when
they
prosecute
criminal
for
a
question,
where
the
relevance
has
never
been
stated
by
the
committee
and
where
a
different
relevance
is
presented
every
time
i
go
to
a
different
court
with
this
case
and
i
hear
a
different
effort
to
rationalize
this
reason
for
these
questions,
i
can
only
feel
it
seems
to
me,
perfectly
clear
that
the
only
possible
reason
for
asking
a
man
the
names
of
whether
certain
persons
were
communists
in
the
19
--
mid-1940's.
we're
asking
him
that
10
years
later
was
an
effort
to
expose
him
and
them
to
scorn
and
ridicule.
