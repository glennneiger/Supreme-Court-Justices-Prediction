justice
hugo
l.
black
in
your
brief
or
the
other
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
relevant
to
our
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
all?
they
had
already
found
out
that
they
were,
when
they
asked
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
purpose
in
asking
him
if
they
already
knew?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
think
it
was
unreliable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
brought
him
in.
they
didn't
bring
him
in
to
challenge
that
testimony.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
is
one
of
its
grounds.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
by
that,
that
you
do
not
think
that
the
resolution,
under
which
the
committee
was
acting,
would
authorize
attempting
to
expose
for
exposure's
sake?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
recall
it,
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
just
look
it
to
see.
the
court
relies
pretty
extensively
on
statements
outside
the
committee
hearings
in
the
case
of
united
states
against
lovett
to
find
out
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
congress
and
the
committee
in
passing
the
bill.
yoy
--
you
say
they
could
not
do
it
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
not
refer
the
reports
or
speeches
made
by
congressman
velde
in
the
house
on
the
subject.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
from
the
inside?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
inside?
i
--
i
understood
him
to
say
some
of
them
made
inside
the
congress.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
committee
report
this
incident
to
the
congress?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
they
reported
it
to
the
congress,
did
they
give
any
indication
as
to
the
relevancy
of
the
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
did
they
--
did
the
congress
just
vote
on
it
when
there's
--
without
any
report
or
any
indication
of
any
kind
as
to
the
materiality
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
all
that
took
place?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
there
was
no
discussion
and
no
--
of
the
report
that
they
made
asking
if
he
be
cited,
or
any
explanation
as
to
the
relevancy
or
irrelevancy
of
the
evidence?
no
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
go
back
to
some
distant
when
you
do,
so
that
we
won't
just
get
what
happened
right
recently.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
there's
a
balance
in
the
process,
i
suppose
it
wouldn't
be
in
the
abstract,
i
don't
know
where
there
is
but
you
would
look
in
a
particular
instance
to
see
if
it
invaded
the
right
of
the
first
amendment
to
any
extent?
i'm
quoted
it
was
in
that
particular
case
as
to
have
but
the
--
took
get
this
information
and
balance
it
against
the
right
to
be
silent
if
there
was
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
couldn't
do
it
in
the
abstract
could
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you're
going
to
have
a
balancing
process.
