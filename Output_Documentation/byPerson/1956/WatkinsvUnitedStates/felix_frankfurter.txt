justice
felix
frankfurter
the
panel
thing
is
not
printed,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
both
the
majority
and
the
minority
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
panel
consisted
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
he
do
(inaudible)
then
you
indicated
a
minute
ago.
he
would
inform
you
that
word
as
to
those
whom
you
regarded
a
communist.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
the
--
are
the
questions
that
were
refused,
all
in
relation
to
his
knowledge
of
named
persons
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
any
other
question?
no
other
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
merely
a
series
of
names
about
who
he
was
interrogated
and
as
to
whom
he
refused
to
open
his
mouth?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
whole
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
interrupt
you
once
more?
did
the
committee
walk
into
the
door
that
he
opened
and
say,
“you
stated
you're
ready
to
testify
about
former
communists
and
those
who
still
are,
we
now
advise
you
that
the
committee
has
good
reason
for
believing
that
jones,
smith,
robinson,
et
cetera
are
within
that
category.
you
may
have
it
with
information,
on
the
basis
of
our
information,
we
now
press
these
questions.”
is
there
anything
like
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
i
mean
the
chairman?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
anything
outside.
the
chairman,
after
this
statement,
if
the
chairman
say,
“accepting
your
position,
accepting
your
--
a
certain
withdraw
about
yourself,
we
do
like
to
inform
you
we're
pressing
these
questions
because
we
have
reason
to
believe
they
come
within
your
vow
of
readiness
to
testify.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
simply
asked.
“we
want
to
ask
you
about
john
smith,”
and
he
said,
“i
won't
talk
about
it.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
without
any
qualification
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
they
drew
the
circle
and
--
and
stuck
to
it
and
he
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
can
i
tell
just
from
the
question
that
was
put
that
their
purpose
was
or
the
--
or
the
scope
of
the
question
was
nearly
to
expose?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
take
your
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suggest
that
it's
a
very
almost
impossible
abstract
question
that
you're
asking
us
--
asking
to
--
to
address
ourselves,
because
you
certainly
aren't
going
to
urge
that
they
must
have
an
immediate
bill
in
mind,
that
they
must
pass
an
enactment.
and
therefore,
we
certainly
aren't
going
to
argue,
i
suppose
that
they
can't
decide
whether
they
should
pass
a
bill.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
that
has
to
be
preceded
by
inquiring
and
once
you
begin
to
argue
whether
that's
merely
informative
or
--
or
pre-legislative,
i
don't
think
it
is
a
very
profitable
line
of
inquiry,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
light
of
inquiry
is
that
it
can't
use
its
activities,
merely
for
purposes
of
exposure.
i
don't
think
that
needs
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
by
your
talking,
you
tell
me
when
it
is
and
when
it
isn't
exposure,
that
does
require
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
congress
isn't
the
u.s.
attorney
or
an
attorney
general.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
long
was
he
understands
throughout?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
totally
an
hour.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
was
going
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
during
that
hour's
testimony,
what
was
the
subject
matter
of
their
search
into
him?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
was
forced
coming
in
all
of
those
questions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
they
--
is
this
toward
--
you've
just
indicated
this
was
toward
the
end
of
the
inquiry?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
they
asked
these
questions
about
these
persons
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
as
you've
indicated
to
my
earlier
question,
if
he
--
when
he
said,
“i
won't
talk
about
these
people”
then
they
dropped
him?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
summarize
that
hour?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
might
indicate
the
--
the
size
of
the
magnitude
of
the
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
wrong
in
having
the
impression
that
mr.
hoover
almost
annually
gives
us
a
statical
account?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
suppose
i
put
the
most
favorable
aspect
on
this
as
i
think
one
must.
suppose
when
he
refused
to
answer
the
inquiry
about
the
first
--
when
the
first
name
was
put
then,
the
chairman
has
then
said
to
mr.
watkins.
“let
me
read
you
what
i
said
in
march
in
chicago
as
to
why
this
committee
is
here.
and
in
connection
with
that,
i
now
repeat
my
question,
please
tell
us
about
mr.
smith.
what
difference
would
that
make
in
your
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
said
this
court,
have
we
had
any
case?
have
we
decided
any
case
in
which
we
carried
over
a
doctrine
of
ratification
by
subsequent
legislation
in
the
sense
that
whatever
any
committee
did
under
any
prior
resolution
was
read
into
incorporated
by
reference
as
though
it
specifically
approved
of
every
action
taken
by
a
prior
committee,
anything
like
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
i'm
recalled
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
specific
rulings
on
a
specific
situation
with
a
specific
adjudication.
even
that
caused
a
good
deal
of
imagination
to
assume
that
congress
knows
all
about
it
or
that
reenacts
it.
but
in
all
events,
that's
a
very
different
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rauh,
you
strongly
urged
the
relevance
of
the
announced
purpose
of
the
committee
as
shedding
light
on
or
rate
--
illuminating
what
they
actually
did.
you
argued
that
if
a
man
says,
“this
is
my
purpose,”
and
then
something
happens
would
you
bail
out
that
purpose
that
that
colors
then
qualifies.
but
you
haven't
--
perhaps
you
want
to
rest
it
on
the
briefs
and
so,
i'd
like
to
know
what
--
what
is
the
basis
for
your
saying
that
they
announced
that
they're
engaged
in
a
process
of
exposing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
your
answer
to
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
did
this
committee,
to
this
--
the
chairman
of
this
committee
make
any
such
statement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
state
what
you
regard
as
the
most
unequivocal
assertion
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
by
this
chairman.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
a
speech
that
he
made?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
--
and
--
and
his
role
as
chairman.
he
wasn't
addressing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
his
--
his
enthusiast
in
chicago.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor,
may
i
ask
merely
to
search
the
record.
are
you
implying
or
is
it
to
be
implied
that
in
his
resistances,
he
was
exculpatory
of
himself?
was
there
any
suggestion
that
he
was
evasive
or
trying
to
get
from
under
in
answering
any
questions
that
might
put
him
in
an
--
if
you
please,
undesirable
or
questionable
life?
did
he
show
any
invasion
about
his
--
in
the
--
i
read
the
record
that's
why
i'm
asking
you
(voice
overlap)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
whereas
all
the
shield
in
order
to
prevent
further
exploration
of
his
incite?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
my
question
had
an
implication,
went
a
little
beyond
that,
whether
the
kind
of
relevancies
that
you
sketched
or
outlined
before
lunch.
whether
the
inquiries
which
you
indicated
would
be
relevant
to
what
had
preceded.
whether
he
wasn't
fore
coming
in
dealing
with
questions
addressed
to
him,
so
far
as
his
conduct
and
his
relation
and
his
knowledge
was
concerned
sort
of
inquiry
with
these
other
people?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
take
it
your
answer
that
he
didn't
show
any
withholding
(voice
overlap)
with
himself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
there
was
--
and
you
agree
that
the
record
doesn't
disclose
any
--
what
shall
i
say,
any
indication
or
explicit
endeavor
on
the
part
of
the
chairman
and
he
was
the
fellow
who
was
asking
question,
was
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
elucidating
why
the
question,
which
you
refuse
to
answer,
might
bail
on
issues
that
had
been
dealt
with
and
as
to
which
he
did
give
testimony?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
all
of
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
was
no
point
at
to
which
--
perhaps
i
can
put
it
more
simply.
there
was
no
indication
when
he
said,
“no,
i
don't
want
to
talk
about
that.”
but
the
chairman
then
said,
well,
may
i
tell
you,
politely
said
incur
this
evening,
maybe
employed
even
before
congressional
committee
to
say,
may
i
tell
you
why
i'm
asking
this
for
the
point
of
this
question
or
let
me
enlighten
you.
there
was
nothing
of
that
sort,
was
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
the
question
was
put
and
denial
made
and
that's
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
question
that
i
put
to
mr.
rauh,
what
can
you
open
the
door
to
the
extent
of
saying,
i
will
disclose
those
whom
i
know
to
be
members
of
the
communist
party.
the
chairman
didn't
say,
“well,
we
do
not
have
to
give
you
of
course
our
information,
but
there's
reason
why
we
ask
that
in
the
light
of
what
you
already
tested.”
there's
nothing
like
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
may
bear
--
that
may
be
relevant.
i
can
see
how
it
is
relevant
as
to
validity
of
the
resolution
itself.
but
the
other
take
care
of
the
specific
question
of
propriety
the
enforced
questioning
of
specific
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understood
that
some
of
the
statements
were
made
in
the
course
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
activity
of
the
committee
itself,
hearing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
to
that,
i
don't
suppose
you
have
to
make
all
for
approve.
i
should
think
that
is
really
judicial
notice,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
as
evidence
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor,
if
this
kind
of
a
question
had
been
asked
in
adversary
preceding
in
court
and
the
witness
is
asked
if
you
know
so
and
so.
and
he
said,
i
don't
want
to
answer
that.
and
nothing
more
appears
in
here
as
to
relevancy,
the
argument
you
have
made.
would
you
--
and
the
theory
of
asking,
do
you
know
john
smith?
but
if
he
said
yes
and
if
he
says
no,
it's
blocked
unless
you
go
and
disprove
the
--
his
denial.
but
if
he
said
--
the
theory
of
asking
that
question
is
because
it
leads
to
some
other
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course
counsel
say
what
i
--
the
witness
says
this
is
--
this
will
have
a
tendency
to
make
my
client
to
do
something
that
is
disagreeable
or
to
be
an
informer
etcetera.
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
the
presiding
judge
say,
what's
the
point
of
this
question?
what
are
you
trying
--
what
subject
matter
do
you
seek
to
elicit
from
this
witness?
wouldn't
counsel
be
asked
to
give
some
indication
why
that
question
should
be
answered
as
a
preliminary
to
some
other
question?
and
the
relation
in
the
chain
of
relevant
sequence
of
such
an
opening
question?
where
the
counsel
say,
well,
i
stand
on
that
question,
i
want
that.
and
the
court
rules
there
have
denied
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
--
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
nobody
would
dream
of
reversing
that
denial,
say
that
the
judge
couldn't
have
said
no?
let
the
witness
stand
on
that
refusal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
most
he
could
get
out
of
them
is
that
he
would
say,
yes,
i
knew
him.
was
he
a
communist?
yes,
he
was
at
the
time.
could
he
get
any
more
out
of
them
than
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
he'll
ask
watkins.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
some
other
--
and
not
the
witness
in
question,
not
watkins?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
he
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
be
--
not
known
to
be
a
communist.
very
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
be
a
dubious
source
of
information
as
to
where
another
person
did,
i
should
think.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
everything
you
connected
with
everything
else
in
this
world.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
eventually.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
it
rather
10
years
to
be
connected,
to
ask
watkins
to
find
out
why
a
lot
of
other
people
left
or
whether
they
have
left?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
he
--
was
there
any
testimony
that
he
was
the
secretary
of
--
that
he
was
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
out
of
that,
you
get
him
as
a
good
source
of
information
or
a
reliable
source
of
information
of
a
lot
of
other
people
did,
that
seem
to
me
a
little
remote
to
the
subject
matter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
assuming
that
and
i'm
assuming
you
would
have
given
a
favorable
answer,
favorable
to
their
point
of
view
and
i
don't
see
how
--
i
fail
to
see
that
how
much
or
to
what
extent,
to
what
serious
extent,
that
would
advance
their
purposes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
didn't
suppose
that
was
under
denial.
i
mean
one
could
almost
take
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
unduly,
i
could
almost
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
there's
a
good
deal
of
infiltration
in
various
unions.
and
that
wasn't
in
controversy
as
between
watkins
and
the
committee,
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
if
his
testimony
might
have
exculpated
all
those,
about
whom
they
were
pretty
confident
they
were
communist.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
normal
way
and
is
that
the
conventional
way
in
which
the
committee
that
is
bulked
in
its
inquiry,
reports
to
the
house
or
senate
respectively
and
ask
that
the
matter
be
referred
to
the
department
of
justice
or
u.s.
attorney,
whatever
it
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
be
good
enough
to
do
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
was
a
subcommittee,
was
this
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
members
on
this?
was
there
three
or
five?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
this
--
in
the
actual
--
in
the
actual
inquiry,
how
many?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
was
a
subcommittee?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this,
mr.
solicitor,
and
the
question
i'm
going
to
ask
you
in
one
who
i
think
is
conscious
of
the
--
in
grave
questions
raised
by
this,
more
particularly
who
were
--
does
not
think
that
we
ought
to
be
(inaudible)
here,
confining
in
this
power
of
congress,
scrutinize
independently
whether
it's
--
what
the
--
whether
its
legislation
maybe
potentially
relevant
or
not.
it's
from
that
point
of
view
that
i
ask.
how
restrictive
of
everything,
how
embarrassing
to
the
plea
that
you're
making
and
from
my
point
of
view
properly
making?
and
i'd
say
it
carries
to
through
the
case,
i
have
any
opinion
on.
but
from
the
point
of
view
with
--
to
which
you're
addressing
yourself,
namely,
the
importance
of
the
coordinate
branch
of
the
government
and
the
duty
to
get
enlightenment
before
you
legislate
or
to
get
enlightenment
in
order
to
decide
not
to
legislate.
how
curving,
how
trampling
to
a
generous
view
of
that
would
it
be
to
say
that
when
a
--
when
a
witness
before
a
committee
refuses
to
answer
or
states
a
ground
withholding
that
certainly
on
the
phase
of
it,
is
an
honorable
refusal,
certainly
on
the
phase
of
it
is
one
to
which
one
responds
as
the
--
in
the
ordinary
civilized
society.
how
crippling
would
it
be
to
all
to
the
most
generous
and
hospitable
alliance
of
the
congressional
power
of
inquiry
to
say
that
when
you
have
no
more
than
this,
it
all
events
you
ought
to
be
fortified
in
the
relevance
by
saying,
"well,
we'll
adjourn.
we'll
get
a
vote
of
the
full
committee."
or
"we'll
make
it
clear
by
explicitness
that
this
does
bear
on
the
legislative
purpose."
and
my
legislative
purpose
that
i
have
indicated
means
not
only
that
they
must
legislate
but
they
often
--
ought
not
to
legislate.
how
much
--
how
curving
would
it
be
not
to
let
it
dried
off
on
this
--
ask
a
question,
you
know
john
smith?
you
know
william
jones?
you
know
henry
robinson?
and
you
know
fred
phillips?
and
then
come
down
with
a
contempt
power
not
exercised
by
congress
on
its
own
responsibility
but
going
to
the
courts
and
asking
the
courts
to
impose
that
criminal
sanction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
assuming
anything.
i'm
just
assuming
that
what
you
rightly
put
to
the
court
in
their
balancing,
that
when
you
extract
testimony
from
a
witness,
who
gives
the
reason
as
this
man
did
to
himself
has
not
been
invasive
as
to
anything
pertaining
to
his
own
conduct.
he's
ready
to
be
pillared
to
the
extent
of
that
pillar
he's
in
and
then
says
you're
asking
me
now
about
people
who
--
who
seem
to
me
to
be
honorable
citizens,
so
far
as
i
know
haven't
committed
a
crime
and
i
don't
want
to
make
a
disclosure.
you
could
ask
him
too
much
for
the
committee
then
either
to
expound
the
question,
make
it
clear
and
not
have
to
the
witness
or
if
it
gets
beyond
that
to
have
the
courts
not
rest
on
any
presumption,
presumably
(inaudible)
company
had
laudable
legislative
purpose.
will
that
be
asking
too
much?
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
answer
to
my
question
is
that
this
record
satisfies
those
implications
of
fairness
that
i
have
put
to
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
not
for
us
to
criticize
or
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
now,
you're
--
you're
--
what
you've
just
said
the
last
few
minutes,
what
you
previously
said,
that
this
--
that
justice
in
the
lower
court,
the
trial
before
a
judge,
any
questions
that
are
logically
relevant,
remotely
so,
but
logically
relevant
are
not
allowed
to
be
asked,
the
offense,
the
area
of
relevance
is
fenced
in
an
inquiry
before
a
court.
so
you
now
say
that
the
area
of
relevance
before
a
congressional
committee,
no
matter
how
loose
you
are
is
fenced
in
by
the
turns
of
the
resolution
and
if
you
go
beyond
that
by
the
separation
of
powers,
is
that
what
your
argument
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
really
gets
down
to
that,
doesn't
it?
that
this
is
unrelated
to
the
allowable
range
of
relevant
inquiry
with
you
to
do
the
subject
matter
with
which
this
commission
--
committee
was
charged?
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
--
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
been.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
like
--
that's
like
ruling
out,
waiving
the
body
shape
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
it
may
have
some
relevance
but
it's
too
costly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
it
--
practically
to
be
assumed
that
in
a
case
like
this
or
anything
like
it,
any
lawyer,
particularly
you,
you've
raised
the
first
amendment
point
(inaudible)
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
he
said
in
the
hearing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
he
may.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you've
got
a
form
letter,
haven't
you?
[laughter]
