mr.
j.
lee
rankin
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
call
your
attention
first
to
one
--
one
statement
in
the
briefs
that
i
should
like
to
clarify
in
regard
to
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
in
the
other
brief
and
it's
in
regard
to
whether
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
there
was
a
legislative
purpose
in
the
questions
that
were
asked
and
counsel
in
the
brief
recite
that
the
court
merely
said
that
there
could
have
been
such
a
legislative
purpose.
on
page
178
of
the
record,
the
court
said,
“the
questions
asked
watkins
could
be
asked
for
a
valid
legislative
purpose."
then,
if
you
will
go
on
to
the
bottom
of
the
page,
the
same
page,
you'll
find
that
the
court
said,
“a
majority
of
the
court
gives
out
the
opinion
that
the
questions
were
pertinent
to
a
valid
legislative
purpose
and
were
authorized
by
the
act.”
now,
from
what
the
court
has
heard,
it
must
be
difficult
to
understand
how
anyone
could
say
that
there
could
be
a
valid
legislative
purpose
in
the
questions
that
were
asked.
and
so,
if
you
will
bear
with
me
briefly,
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
the
evidence
and
see
what
there
was
before
this
committee
upon
which
they
could
ask
such
questions
that
would
show
a
valid
legislative
purpose
to
six
out
of
eight
common
judges
of
the
court
of
appeals.
this
appearance
was
a
continuance
of
a
prior
hearing
that
started
in
chicago.
and
the
petitioner
was
asked
whether
he
knew
of
the
testimony
of
two
of
the
other
witness,
prior
witnesses,
mr.
rumsey
and
mr.
spencer
and
he
said
he
was
familiar
with
it.
and
what
did
they
testified
to?
mr.
rumsey
said
he
was
recruited
into
the
communist
party
by
the
petitioner
that
at
the
beginning
he
paid
dues
to
him
being
the
petitioner.
later,
he
collected
dues
from
the
petitioner
who
assumed
the
alias
of
sam
brown.
then,
the
committee
asked
many
questions
of
mr.
rumsey.
and
amongst
them,
he
asked
about
the
infiltration
of
the
communist
party
into
this
union.
two
of
the
questions
are
particular
of
interest
with
regard
to
a
valid
legislative
purpose.
on
page
138,
close
to
the
bottom
of
the
page,
statement
of
mr.
rumsey
in
answering
the
question.
i'll
read
the
question
first.
“mr.
rumsey
what
was
it?
what
you
--
would
you
describe
to
the
committee
the
main
purpose
and
activities
of
that
branch
of
the
party?
what
were
they
trying
to
do
for
the
communist
party?”
mr.
rumsey,
“well
what
they
were
striving
to
do
was
to
disrupt
mainly
to
set
their
program
of
propaganda
to
get
the
shop
workers
acclimated
to
the
daily
worker
and
that
was
the
function
of
the
organizer.”
then,
there's
other
testimony
about
how
things
were
being
done
and
on
page
139
and
about
the
same
general
point
on
the
page,
mr.
(inaudible),
“could
you
tell
us
specifically
what
your
duties
were
as
organizer
for
the
communist
party?”
that
was
to
mr.
rumsey.
mr.
rumsey
answered,
“well,
to
recruit
and
to
recruit
new
members,
hold
study
groups,
clubs
as
they
called
it,
study
clubs
in
the
evenings
and
then
as
i
say,
keep
our
people
in
the
shop
what
communist
we
had
to
lead
the
union
meetings
and
dominate
them.”
then,
spencer
said
he
recruited
--
was
recruited
in
the
communist
party
by
rumsey
with
the
endorsement
of
this
petitioner
as
well
as
if
prior
approval.
petitioner
was
then
the
vice
president
of
the
farm
equipment
cio
and
he
said
he
attended
communist
party
meeting
at
which
the
petitioner
and
two
others,
kate
hall
and
jerry
field
were
present.
then,
the
petitioner
described
his
official
position
with
the
union.
he
was
one
of
the
important
officers
during
this
period
at
which
time
the
evidence
is
clear
from
these
other
witnesses
that
this
union
was
infiltrated
by
the
communist
party.
petitioner
admitted
knowing
rumsey
and
spencer
and
was
familiar
with
their
testimony
concerning
him.
he
admitted
that
he
cooperated
with
the
communist
party
and
having
“participated
in
communist
activities
during
1942
to
1947,”
to
such
a
degree
that
some
persons
may
honest
believe
--
honestly
believe
we
too
have
been
a
party
member.
he
admitted
making
contributions
to
the
communist
causes,
signed
petitions
for
their
various
causes,
attended
coxes
at
a
convention
of
the
union
at
which
communist
party
officials
were
present.
he
participated
in
the
union
meetings
with
the
communist
(inaudible),
attended
public
meetings
of
the
communist
party
at
which
william
z.
foster
then
president
spoke.
he
also
testified
that
he
was
aware
that
--
that
there
was
a
general
program
policy
of
the
communist
party
to
attempt
to
control
the
various
unions
and
testified
it
was
quote
“probably
correct
to
say
that
the
discussions
he
had
with
them,
individuals
known
by
him
to
be
communist
had
been
in
connection
with
their
desire
to
control
the
union's
policy
and
activities.”
already
denied
that
he
had
been
a
card
carrying
member
of
the
communist
party.
he
contradicted
both
spencer
and
rumsey
and
said
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
recruiting
men.
he
said
that
spencer
was
wrong
when
he
termed
any
meetings
which
the
petitioner
attended
as
closed
communist
party
meetings.
he
contradicted
rumsey
and
denied
having
recruited
rumsey
or
receiving
dues
from
him
or
paying
dues
to
him
under
the
alias
of
sam
brown.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
because
of
this.
it
shows
that
there
was
an
inquiry
to
this
man
about
the
question
of
infiltrating
unions
for
communist
purposes.
the
--
the
congress
within
four
months
after
this
in
the
communist
control
act
of
1954
passed
an
amendment
to
the
internal
security
act
of
1950
in
which
it
provided
with
regard
to
unions
which
had
been
infiltrated
and
took
away
from
their
opportunity
to
have
the
benefits
of
the
nlra.
so
that
congress
was
inquiring
at
this
very
moment
about
that
from
this
very
petitioner,
obtained
information
from
him
that
he
knew
that
that
was
what
was
happening
in
that
very
union,
that
the
communist
party
was
actively
engaged
in
this
very
activity.
they
then
proceed
to
legislate
about
it
and
they
were
inquiring
about
it
at
the
time
to
determine
about
the
legislation.
now,
when
they
asked
him
about
these
things,
the
evidence
also
shows
that
everyone
of
these
people
that
they
asked
him
about,
they
had
asked
rumsey
and
spencer
about
prior
to
that
and
rumsey
and
spencer
has
said
that
they
were
members
of
the
communist
party.
and
they
had
also
asked
as
i
have
shown,
rumsey
and
spencer
about
propaganda
activities,
the
efforts
of
the
communist
party
to
infiltrate
this
very
union
and
what
they
knew
about
it.
now,
this
witness
comes
there
and
he
said
--
he
denies
the
testimony
of
rumsey
and
spencer
with
regard
to
himself
and
rumsey
and
spencer
in
this
very
proceeding
at
chicago
had
been
asked
about
some
25
to
30
different
persons
whether
they
were
communist.
and
rumsey
and
spencer
said
that
everyone
was.
here,
this
man
says,
“i
wasn't
a
communist.
i
did
a
lot
of
things
like
people
might
think
i
was
a
communist,
but
i
wasn't.”
he
apparently
had
knowledge
in
regard
to
this
union.
he
was
an
officer
of
it.
he
cooperated
with
the
communist
and
then
very
active.
now,
if
you
could
find
any
place
that
was
more
ideal
to
try
to
discover
facts
upon
which
congress
could
act
knowledge
--
knowledgeably,
i'd
like
to
know
what
it
could
be.
here,
in
this
very
union,
in
this
very
thing
that
congress
was
looking
for
had
happened.
they
had
infiltrated,
this
man
was
part
of
it
and
these
witnesses
that
testified
to
his
participation
and
to
the
other
activities
and
how
they
did
it,
by
propaganda
and
the
common
methods
of
the
communist
party.
then,
they
come
to
him
and
they
asked
him.
he
says,
“i'm
not
a
communist,”
and
he
says,
“these
men
might
have
thought
so,
but
i'm
not,”
and
he
questioned
their
testimony
about
receiving
dues
or
whether
a
man
was
a
communist
or
not.
it
might
be
a
question
that
is
difficult
and
his
explanation
of
the
fact,
“that
i
acted
like
a
communist.
i
cooperated
with
them.
i
did
things
from
which
people
might
infer
or
conclude
i
was
a
communist,”
might
be
answer
to
that.
but
when
you
get
down
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
paid
dues
and
received
dues,
that's
a
question
of
fact
that
would
be
hard
to
be
wrong
about.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
only
thing
that
could
be
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
only
way
that
could
be
construed
that
way,
i
think,
would
be
the
fact
that
he
denied
this
expressed
testimony
of
these
other
witnesses
in
regard
to
this
inquiry.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
reasonable
that
anyone
who
was
making
such
an
examination
either
in
court
or
in
a
congressional
committee
where
the
committee
members
may
or
not
have
the
same
experience
that
lawyers
have
in
dealing
with
witnesses
that
when
the
witness
starts
to
deny
the
testimony,
not
only
of
whether
he
was
a
communist,
but
whether
he
had
paid
and
received
money
as
dues
in
the
communist
party
that
they
had
a
right
to
go
into
that
further.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
as
we
--
from
justice
frankfurter,
i'd
like
to
make
it
very
clear
the
government's
position
about
that.
the
question
was
whether
or
not
this
was
possibly
a
device
or
means
to
avoid
further
inquiry
to
the
petitioner,
and
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
the
government
does
not
claim
anything
of
that
kind.
it
could
accomplish
that
purpose
just
as
well
if
it
was
so
intended
but
we
do
not
so
charge
him
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
give
such
an
implication.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
his
only
withholding
was
apparently
with
regard
to
the
people
that
he
said
had
left
the
party
that
he
knew
and
knew
something
about
whether
or
not
they
were
or
were
not
in
before.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
must
correct
that
the
questions
were
asked
by
the
chairman
and
various
members
of
the
committee
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
then
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
except
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
there
was
the
one
statement
by
the
chairman,
when
he
direct
in
--
directed
in
to
answer.
in
which
he
said
he
thought
he
had
information
that
would
be
helpful
to
the
committee
and
that
he
should
give
it.
and
he
then
said,
he
direct
him
to
answer
but
it
doesn't
go
as
broad
i
think
as
your
question.
and
it
seems
to
me
the
only
area
that
the
committee
could
have
said
that
he
was
not
frank
was
if
he
was
falsifying
about
whether
he
did
continue
dues
to
these
--
to
the
communist
party
and
through
to
these
very
persons,
and
whether
he
collected
dues
from
these
very
persons.
and
whether
he
was
in
fact
a
communist
when
they
said
he
was.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there
is
the
record
that
he
knew
everything
that
happened
as
far
as
this
other
inquiry
to
spencer
and
rumsey.
and
seems
to
me
much
of
that
shows
what
the
committee
was
trying
to
get
at
and
i'd
like
to
give
you
a
little
of
that
this
time.on
page
76
of
the
record,
there's
a
small
portion
that
i'd
like
to
call
your
attention
to
over
a
testimony
of
mr.
watkins.
mr.
molder,
member
of
the
committee,
then
examining
was
to
what
extent
or
in
what
manner
did
you
cooperate,
did
you
attend
meetings
of
the
leadership
of
the
communist
party,
or
was
your
cooperation
with
some
of
the
movements
that
they
were
undertaking
in
cooperation
with
the
labor
at
that
time?
well,
the
cooperation
as
i
referred
to
in
my
statement
was
had
by
contributions.
i've
been
present
at
meetings,
coxes
i
referred
to,
and
that
is
what
i
mean
by
cooperation.
did
you
participate
in
any
political
meetings
where
only
communist
were
involved?
i
have
attended
in
my
work
in
the
labor
union
thousands
of
meetings,
sometimes
as
many
as
four
days,
answered
about
any
specific
meeting,
it
would
necessarily
have
to
be
pinpointed
to
some
recollection.
well,
did
you
consider
yourself
as
actually
affiliating
yourself
within
this
cause
or
the
philosophy
of
the
communist
party
movement
during
that
period
or
time
or
were
you
using
the
communist
party
in
your
work
as
a
labor
leader?
that
is
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
clear
a
moment
ago.
i
was
trying
to
distinguish.
we
do
distinguish
between
those
activities.
well,
i
would
say
that
on
occasions
there
was
no
difference
in
opinion
on
a
position,
which
i
might
have
felt
the
communist
were
also
in
support
of
that
position,
and
i
did
not
oppose
it.
but
where
i
felt
that
their
position
different
with
mine,
i
did
oppose.
and
he
goes
on
and
describes
in
some
detail,
the
collaboration
that
he
had
during
that
period
with
the
members
of
the
communist
party.
then
on
page
156
of
the
record
is
a
detailed
testimony
of
mr.
spencer,
in
which
each
one
of
these
people
that
the
petitioner
was
later
asked
about,
whether
they
were
members
of
the
communist
party.
were
gone
into
in
detail
and
the
questioning
demonstrates,
it
seems
to
the
government,
very
clearly
what
the
committee
was
trying
to
find
out.
they
were
asking
about
the
membership
of
this
particular
communist
party
sale
or
group
in
the
quad
cities.and
then
they
took
each
one
of
them
and
tried
to
find
out
what
those
people
did.
various
ones
were
in
the
af
of
l
union
and
so
we're
not
in
the
particular
union
that
the
petitioner
was
in,
some
of
them
worked
in
the
city
and
were
not
in
a
union
activity,
and
others
were
closely
identified
with
the
union
activity
of
this
particular
union
that
had
become
infiltrated.
in
fact,
there
is
one
question
at
the
middle
of
page,
what
positions
in
the
union
were
held
by
members
of
your
branch
of
the
communist
party?
well,
i
was
vice-chairman
of
the
local
and
chairman
of
the
grievance
committee,
and
walter
rumsey
was
chairman
of
the
local,
and
gus
gustafson
was
secretary
of
treasurer
of
the
local,
and
hazel
jones
was
the
steward
in
the
local,
was
steward
in
the
tractor
drivers.
and
i
believe
those
are
the
only
executive
positions
within
the
local,
there
were
held
by
many
to
the
communist
party.
did
that
virtually
assure
communist
control
of
the
activities
in
the
union,
a
good
sharer?i
would
say
--
i
wouldn't
say
absolute
control,
but
quite
a
bit
of
them.
and
then
they
go
on
with
each
one
these
people
trying
to
identify
what
function
they
had
with
relation
to
union
activities
in
that
area,
whether
they
were
--
and
did
find
out
that
they
were
communist
party
members
from
spencer
and
rumsey.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
and
he
proceeded.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
was
to
try
to
verify
the
testimony
that
they
had
gotten.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
he
had
already
indicated
that
was
unreliable
as
to
him
by
saying
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
don't
suppose
they
anticipated
that
that
would
occur.
and
they
were
trying
to
--
maybe
it
was
cumulative,
maybe
it
was
more
evidence,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that
ought
to
be
left
to
the
committee
within
any
reasonable
bounds
at
all
when
they
were
still
actively
trying
to
find
out
the
facts
about
this
problem
with
infiltration
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
entirely,
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
area
of
this
problem
we're
dealing
with,
that
the
--
the
court
should
approach
it
in
a
hospitable
manner
to
try
to
give
the
congress
an
opportunity
to
function
within
a
reasonable
limit.
and
that
if
this
was
a
court
of
law
and
this
problem
came
up,
it
was
reasonable
for
the
committee
to
wonder
where
the
truth
lies,
they
had
some
evidences.
in
fact,
they
had
evidences
in
their
files,
there
wasn't
any
question
about
that.
i
don't
think
that
this
court
should
ever
limit
the
committee
to
what's
in
their
file
because
it
might
not
prove
to
be
the
truth
at
all.
and
so,
upon
having
such
an
investigation,
part
of
their
--
important
part
of
the
very
things
that
you
would
rely
and
if
you're
going
to
try
to
act
upon
such
legislation,
was
the
testimony
of
men
like
rumsey
and
spencer
right
here.
that
this
very
union
had
been
infiltrated
by
the
communist
party
and
that
they
have
gotten
all
these
important
officers,
if
they
didn't
dominate
it,
they
certainly
had
an
important
voice
in
the
control
of
it.
and
now
this
man
comes,
who
maybe
is
cumulative
but
still
they
had
a
right,
it
seems
to
me
within
the
reason
to
limit
to
ask
him.
and
they
asked
him
and
he
says
i
wasn't
a
member
of
the
party
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
within
--
within
four
months.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
there
was.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
referred
to
in
the
briefs
and
counsel
for
petitioner
say,
that
it
doesn't
discuss
the
detail
of
the
testimony.
but
it
does
refer
expressly,
government
states
in
his
brief
to
the
testimony
of
rumsey.
and
that
they
have
had
very
extended
hearings
in
regard
to
the
whole
matter.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
in
support
of
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
proposed
legislation.
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
and
so,
we
are
saying
that
in
this
particular
proceeding,
that
it
was
a
reasonable
legislative
purpose
and
legitimate
in
this,
in
trying
to
discover
the
facts
about
whether
or
not
to
legislate
in
this
matter,
to
try
to
find
out
where
the
truth
lay
between
these
people.
now,
we
do
not
claim
on
behalf
of
the
government
that
there's
any
right
to
expose
for
purposes
of
exposure
and
i
don't
know
that
congress
has
ever
claimed
any
such
right.
but
we
do
say
that
they're
in
the
same
ground,
that
there
is
a
right
to
inform
the
public
at
the
same
time
they
inform
the
congress.
and
i
think
that's
inherent
in
our
system
because
if
matter
comes
up,
then
maybe
a
considerable
public
opinion
in
the
country
that
certain
legislation
should
be
enacted.
and
the
congress
might
make
an
independent
investigation
with
such
skill
on
investigators
that
it
has
and
find
out,
as
a
matter
a
fact
from
that
investigation,
that
legislation
is
not
required,
that
the
situation
is
not
as
the
public
believes
it.
now,
it
seems
to
me
it's
very
proper
for
them
to
have
a
hearing
and
develop
the
facts.
not
only
to
show
to
congress,
that
there
is
no
need
for
legislation
in
that
area,
but
also
to
show
the
public,
because
under
a
democratic
system,
the
legislation
responds
to
public
opinion
and
demand.
and
so
as
long
as
that's
related
in
that
manner,
it
seems
to
me
that's
legitimate
and
that
this
court
should
not
prevent
the
congress
from
carrying
on
that
kind
of
an
activity.
it
is
merely
to
expose
for
exposure's
sake,
we
do
not
claim
any
such
thing
and
we
don't
believe
that
the
congress
does.
i
think
there's
another
important
problem
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
did
--
i
think
two
things.
that's
true
that
it
did
not,
and
secondly,
i
do
not
think
that
this
--
the
facts
of
this
hearing
shows
there
was
any
purpose
to
do
anything
of
that
kind.
i
think
that
this
committee
was
diligently
trying
to
find
out
facts
upon
which
they
could
legislate
and
did
legislate
within
a
very
short
period
of
time.
it's
next
suggested
that
in
trying
to
determine
whether
this
action
or
hearing
was
a
--
and
the
questions
under
it,
were
a
proper
--
had
a
proper
legislative
purpose,
that
the
court
must
not
confine
itself
to
the
resolution
of
the
congress,
which
counsels
developed.
and
the
hearing
itself
but
must
turn
to
extraneous
evidence
of
all
unsoundly
kinds.
i
think
that
is
a
situation
that's
impossible
for
the
courts
to
be
asked
to
deal
with.
it's
unreasonable
and
i'd
like
to
develop
just
briefly
the
problems
that
would
result
from
it.
it's
the
governments
position
--
i'd
like
to
make
it
clear
that
the
court
should
confine
itself
to
the
resolution
of
the
congress
and
the
hearing
proceedings
of
whatever
happened
in
the
hearing.
now,
if
you
go
beyond
that,
you
have
the
question
of
whether
or
not
you're
going
to
try
the
members
of
the
congress.
are
you
going
to
inquire
of
each
committee
member
as
to
what
his
position
is
with
regard
to
a
particular
matter?
what
his
motives
were
in
making
certain
inquires
to
a
certain
witness?
are
you
going
to
rely
on
that
or
do
you
have
to
go
from
the
subcommittee
to
the
whole
committee?
or
do
you
have
to
go
beyond
that,
from
the
house
and
include
the
senate,
because
each
of
them
engaged
in
this
activity.
it
seems
to
me
it's
an
impossible
situation
to
do
that.
if
the
chairman
makes
a
speech
or
statement
in
which
he
purports
to
state
what
the
purpose
of
intention
is.
i
don't
see
how
the
congress
itself
should
be
bound
by
anything
of
that
character,
unless
it
is
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
congress
in
such
a
way
and
the
congress
takes
a
vote
or
some
action
that
this
court
would
feel
it
would
have
to
respect
this
congressional
action.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
problem
it
seems
to
me
is
that
if
you
are
going
to
inquire
as
to
this
particular
committee,
then
they
put
in
the
record
here
which
the
court
below
not
receive
all
kinds
of
statements
by
mr.
velde,
speeches,
quotations
from
the
various
newspapers
and
statements
by
others
in
--
who
would
acted
in
connection
with
such
a
committee.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
hearing.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
of
course,
if
it
was
a
part
of
this
proceeding,
even
as
started
in
and
for
the
whole
period
of
time,
which
we
consider
a
continuous
proceeding.
it
would
certainly
be
proper
for
the
court
to
examine
that
and
find
out
what
was
doing
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
as
it's
bearing
upon
(voice
overlap).
that's
right.
but
these
are
statements
that
go
back
of
that
to
other
times
when
the
committee
was
acting
and
its
membership
changed
over
the
years.
its
chairmanship
changed,
and
how
a
committee
at
this
particular
time
can
be
bound
by
all
of
the
different
things
that
someone
might
say
outside
of
the
hearings
or
even
in
the
hearings
that
were
not
a
part
of
this
particular
committee's
activity
for
the
period.
that
it
was
constituted
as
not
under
the
congress.
it
seems
to
present
problems
that
are
almost
impossible
of
solution
if
the
courts
get
into
that.
and
we
feel
that
the
only
way
that
you
can
fairly
treat
the
congress
in
the
consideration
of
this
problem
is
to
deal
with
the
places
where
it
took
action.
and
all
of
the
proceedings,
of
the
hearings
certainly
ought
to
be
examined
to
see
whether
it
was
a
valid
approach
to
try
and
carry
out
the
congressional
function
and
the
resolution
that
empowered
them
to
act.
and
the
other
things
you've
read
to
see
some
member
of
the
committee
might
speak
up
and
express
some
idea
that
none
of
the
other
members
would
be
willing
to
accept
but
wouldn't
want
to
because
of
the
situation
to
take
--
to
cause
any
offense
by
taking
acceptance
--
exception
to
it
at
that
moment.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
that
we
would
be
getting
into
an
area
that
would
be
almost
impossible
to
resolve
anything
from.
and
that
the
court
should,
like
the
lower
court
did,
confine
itself
to
the
resolution
and
the
proceedings.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
i
--
i
think
that
those
reports
are
referred
to
here
and
there's
no
question
about
those.
but
as
to
speeches
on
the
outside,
i
don't
think
those
are
binding
upon
the
congress.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
they
were
in
connection
with
legislation,
i
think
it
would
have
bearing
on
the
legislation
but
not
in
connection
as
to
these
particular
hearings
and
whether
or
not
there
was
a
valid
legislative
purpose
as
to
the
questions
at
hand.
now,
i
dealt
with
--
and
call
court's
particular
attention
to
the
several
references
in
the
inquiry
to
mr.
rumsey
on
pages
138
and
139,
directly
to
the
question
of
propaganda,
that
were
being
asked
him
in
connection
with
his
examination.
and
as
the
position
of
the
government,
that
this
was
a
part
of
the
hearings
that
was
continuous,
that
they
brought
to
the
attention
of
this
petitioner
the
fact
that
he
was
fairly
familiar
with
the
examination
of
mr.
rumsey.
and
it
was
contemplated
that
the
same
area
would
be
examined
in
connection
with
mr.
watkins.
and
that
the
examination
never
proceeded
to
that
point,
because
they
got
to
a
place
where
the
witness
was
unwilling
to
answer
questions
which
they
thought
had
an
important
bearing
upon
his
credibility
and
didn't
see
any
purpose
in
trying
to
go
further
to
cover
any
greater
area
with
him.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
only
what
i
read
to
you
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
on
page
76,
they
asked
him
in
regard
to
his
various
activities
and
he
told
about
his
participation
in
various
types
of
activities
that
involved
petitions
that
he
signed,
the
things
of
that
kind
were
certainly
part
of
the
propaganda
of
the
communist
party,
as
generally
understood.
and
they
also
inquired
about
his
activities
in
regard
to
the
purposes
and
plans
of
the
party
that
he
supported
and
accepted.
and
the
parts
that
he
rejected
when
it
didn't
go
along
with
his
ideas
of
what
was
the
thing
to
do
with
the
union.
so
that
they
were
covering
the
general
area
all
the
time,
not
only
with
him
but
the
other
witnesses
of
the
propaganda
and
all
of
the
activities
that
are
connected
with
the
communist
party.
the
position
of
the
government
that
the
communist
party
is
involved
in
a
propaganda
movement,
that's
inherent,
and
it
is
also
involved
in
action
in
trying
to
get
that
ideology
accepted
and
applied
in
so
many
places
that
it
can.
that
is
inherent
and
as
then
so
recognized
that
this
--
over
the
years
that
such
inquiries
basic
as
to
any
inquiry
about
the
activities
of
the
communist
party.
and
here,
they
were
trying
to
see
what
those
activities
were.
what
the
petitions
in
the
various
solicitation
and
efforts
to
recruit
members
had
accomplished,
whether
they
had
actually
gotten
control
of
this
union
or
how
much
control
they
had
gotten,
and
what
the
effect
of
it
was.
i
think
it
was
a
reasonable
inquiry
to
follow
that
up
and
find
out
why
these
people
had
left
the
communist
party,
if
they
had.
as
the
witness
seemed
to
indicate,
they
had
derived
at
a
--
sometime,
when
they
had
decided
to
leave
that
party,
it
was
not
indicated
when
and
if
so,
why?
because
that
would
have
a
bearing
upon,
whether
to
--
there
was
a
need
for
the
legislation
and
--
or
whether
the
need
has
disappeared.
and
the
whole
question
of
it
was
before
the
congress
and
before
the
committee
at
the
time.
the
government
contends
that
there
was
no
limitation
upon
the
activity
of
the
committee
and
should
not
be
any
limitation,
because
it
had
some
information
in
its
files.
it
seems
to
us
that
this
case
is
a
very
clear
demonstration
of
the
reason
why
there
should
be
no
such
limitation.
it's
argued
that
since
the
committee
already
had
some
of
this
information,
much
of
it
in
its
files,
that
therefore
there
is
no
basis
for
having
a
valid
legislative
purpose
in
making
further
inquiry.
first
place,
this
--
this
examination
showed
that
there
was
a
difference
between
what
it
had
in
its
files
and
there's
some
argument
by
petitioner
that
the
counsel
for
the
committee
was
not
thoroughly
aware
of
what
was
in
the
files.
it
was
shown
that
there
was
a
considerable
mass
of
evidence
that
the
committee
did
have
in
these
files.
but
the
counsel
did
testify
that
he
was
briefed
carefully
in
regard
to
this
particular
matter
and
whatever
the
committee
had
by
the
investigators
who
were
supposed
to
be
familiar
with
the
material
and
the
files,
and
he
then
proceeded
to
make
the
various
inquiry.
the
government
takes
the
position
that
the
question
of
communist
party
membership
is
a
proper
inquiry
for
any
legislative
committee
dealing
in
subject
matter
that
is
involved
in
that
of
the
--
under
the
resolution
of
the
un-american
activities
committee.
and
this
court
has
passed
upon
whether
or
not
that's
a
proper
type
of
legislation,
sufficient
numbers
of
times
in
douds
and
other
cases,
so
that
there
could
be
no
question
but
what
that
inquiries
is
proper.
it
seems
to
us
in
this
case,
there
is
even
a
greater
reason
for
such
an
inquiry
in
view
of
the
conflict
between
the
witnesses
concerning
mr.
watkins'
membership
in
the
party.
and
whether
these
other
people
were
(inaudible)
activities
and
so
forth.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
it
would
depend
on
what
the
record
was
up
to
that
point.
and
if
it
looked
at
those
inquiries
have
been
made,
we
assume
that
the
witness
knew
what
that
record
was
and
that
inquiries
have
been
made
like
this
had
been
in
regard
to
activity
in
this
union
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
if
you
--
he
could
also
get
out,
whether
he
left
the
party
if
he
puts
the
witness
that
indicated
that
that
was
the
reason.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
mean,
the
various
persons
that
were
inquired
about.
the
witness
had
refused
to
testify
about
because
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
watkins
said
that
the
reason
he
would
not
testify
about
them
was
because
they
had
--
they
were
known
to
him
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
not
to
be
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
so
you
could
also
ask,
not
only
whether
there
was
membership,
but
whether
or
not
they
had
left
the
party
at
sometime
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
they
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
testimony
was
that
he
was
a
part
of
this
very
same
communist
group
in
this
area
but
they
were
all
members
of
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
they
attended
the
meetings.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there
was
testimony
that
he
attended
the
meetings.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
over
the
years.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
they
had
obtained
such
information
from
rumsey
and
spencer,
and
they
were
--
he
had
questioned
the
fact
that
he
was
a
member
and
they
were
then
trying
to
find
out
whether
he
verified
or
denied.
and
they
didn't
indicate
that
they
were
trying
to
find
one
answer
or
the
other
from
him.
and
i
--
it
appeared
the
committee
was
in
good
faith
trying
to
find
out
what
the
fact
was.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
would
held
a
serious
effect
on
whether
or
not
there
was
a
verification
of
what
rumsey
and
spencer
had
already
testified
to,
as
to
the
question
of
infiltration.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
presume
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
as
what
they
were
going
into,
but
the
fact
that
watkins
denied
his
own
participation
certainly
raised
the
question
of
whether
these
people
are
wrong
about
all
the
others
and
made
the
inquiry
reasonable
to
reach
out
and
see
if
they
could
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right
or
at
least
show
that
there
were
in
error
in
relying
on
any
such
evidence
as
that
in
connection
with
their
recommendation
to
the
congress.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
he
was
a
vice-president
of
the
union
and
of
the
farm
equipment
union.
and
it
was
that
union
that
anticipated
him
and
was
infiltrated,
an
inquiry
was
involved.
and
then
the
persons
that
were
described
in
the
testimony
that
i
read
to
you
were
also
persons
who
became
members
of
the
communist
party
and
so
it
was
considered
considerable
control
if
not
dominance
of
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
not
--
not
all
the
people
that
were
asked
about.
the
same
--
the
people
that
i
described
that
were
officers
were
in
the
same
union.
but
in
the
committee's
inquiry,
in
regard
to
all
of
these
long
list
of
other
people,
it
was
shown
that
some
of
them
were
members
of
other
unions.
some
of
them
were
active
in
city
life
and
were
not
in
union
activity
at
all.
and
others
were
a
part
of
this
union
activity
and
actively
forwarding
the
communist
cause
in
this
union.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
not
the
detail
of
it.
it
was
reported
before
the
action
in
regard
to
the
contempt.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
not
any
--
not
in
any
detail.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
reported
the
fact
of
the
inquiries
that
were
made
and
the
failure
to
answer,
and
asked
that
the
action
be
reported
by
the
speaker
--
sent
by
the
speaker
to
the
united
states
attorney
for
action.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
they
also
had
the
report
of
the
committee
in
regard
to
this
legislation
which
described
here,
the
investigations
in
general
terms.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
my
understanding
as
to
usual
way,
i
would
--
i
am
not
inquiring
into
that,
i
would
have
to
check
it
(inaudible)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i'll
do
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
i
will.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
seems
to
the
government
that
that
claim
of
the
first
amendment,
in
the
first
place
it
was
not
made
until
in
this
court
and
i
think
in
the
court
of
appeals
it
was
also
made,
but
it
was
not
made
at
the
time
of
the
hearing.
secondly,
we
feel
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
before
the
committee.
that
the
claim
of
the
first
amendment
is
being
made
not
on
behalf
of
this
petitioner,
but
on
behalf
of
these
other
people.
and
that
the
constitutional
right
is
a
personal
right.
it
belongs
to
these
other
people
and
there's
no
right
in
the
petitioner
to
say,
"i
don't
want
to
tell
anything
about
john
jones
because
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
assuming
that
there
--
if
that
is
the
position,
we
don't
think
that
there
is
a
right
of
silence
in
connection
with
the
first
amendment.
that
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment
is
for
the
right
of
speech
and
the
opportunity
to
speak
so
that
the
various
positions
or
ideas
maybe
presented
and
considered,
and
even
cause
a
change,
lawfully
in
the
form
of
government.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
however,
there's
--
if
there
is
any
right
of
that
character,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
--
that
must
be
balanced
against
the
right
of
the
congress
to
carry
out
its
constitutional
power
as
a
legislative
body.
and
that
in
this
situation,
that
the
legislative
purpose
is
valid
if
they
were
trying
to
develop
that
and
develop
the
information
so
congress
would
have
the
knowledge
that
the
right
to
inquire
must
be
as
broad
as
the
right
to
legislate
in
order
that
congress
have
the
information
that
it
can
make
valid
desirable
legislation
pass
it.
and
that
in
balancing
those
rights
which
of
course
are
not
absolute
that
the
congressional
need
must
be
recognized
and
it
would
be
the
one
that
would
prevail
in
this
situation
and
have
to
if
we're
going
to
have
the
congress
--
have
the
information
that
it
must
have
for
legislation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
there
is
a
question
of
pertinency
of
course
under
the
statute.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
that's
what
i
thought
was
the
question.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
--
i
agree
you
couldn't
do
it
in
the
abstract,
mr.
justice
black,
but
i
do
think
that
the
power
that
you're
dealing
with
here
is
with
regard
to
a
coequal
branch
of
the
government.
and
i
think
that
just
as
you
are
very
careful
about
declaring
any
congressional
action
to
be
unconstitutional
when
they
legislate
that
even
more
so
in
this
area,
the
congress
needs
to
have
a
recognition
of
the
fact
that
it
has
to
have
knowledge,
that
it
has
to
have
information.
and
here,
you're
dealing
not
with
a
particular
law
but
with
the
power
to
conduct
legislation
--
legislative
activity
itself,
and
therefore,
all
of
those
considerations
have
to
be
taken
into
account
when
you're
making
the
decision.
and
the
presumption
if
you
are
dealing
with
the
activity
of
another
court,
lower
court,
would
be
that
it
would
be
a
valid
action,
that
the
court
was
--
taken.
and
it
seems
to
be
it
should
be
a
fortiori
as
to
the
congress
in
a
particular
--
in
a
situation,
so
that
--
and
i
do
not
think
that
you
can
disregard
properly
the
rules
that
should
apply
to
examine
into
this
area
of
congressional
action,
and
its
--
and
the
needs
of
the
congress
to
be
able
to
inquire
and
that
there
should
be
a
presumption
that
when
an
inquiry
is
being
made,
that
they
are
trying
to
do
it
in
accordance
with
their
duties
and
responsibilities.
and
that
you
take
along
all
of
that
laws
in
applying
the
--
or
answering
the
question
about
your
situation
as
we
have
here.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
my
recollection
is
that
they're
not
required
to
be
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
--
i'll
have
to
check
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
it
was.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
i
--
i
think
that
the
--
i
mean
the
facts
of
this
particular
situation,
that
the
assumption
of
the
congress
trying
to
act
fair
and
in
partially,
they're
entitled
to
and
to
have
that
applied
in
this
particular
case.
now,
if
you
assume
that
they
were
not
acting
--
trying
to
act
fairly
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
think
the
record
shows
that
they
--
they
thought
there
was
a
clear
understanding
of
the
question
that
was
being
asked
and
their
purpose
in
asking.
so
that
i
think
the
record
shows
that
they
were
not
trying
in
anyway
to
be
unfair
to
anyone
if
there's
a
mutual
understanding.
he
understands
on
his
legal
grounds
whatever
they
were
and
they
felt
that
there
was
no
other
answer.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
they
did
mr.
justice.
