warren
mr.
sand,
in
order
that
i
may
know
exactly
what
your
position
is,
i
suppose
this
pick-up
man
delivers
these
documents
regularly
to
someone
who
worked
for
the
bank,
whether
it
be
the
bookkeeper
or
--
or
some
other
official
of
the
bank.
now,
do
you
consider
that
the
person
to
whom
he
delivers
those
records
is
also
subject
to
the
act
and
then
to
carry
it
down
farther
through
the
secretarial
force
or
--
or
is
there
an
end
of
the
liability
when
the
pick-up
man
gets
it
down
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
not
the
people
who
process
these
things
after
they
get
to
the
bank.
you
don't
contend
that
they
are
in
the
same
positions,
the
pick-up
man?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
all
i
want
to
know.
chief
justice

chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you,
mr.
sand.
