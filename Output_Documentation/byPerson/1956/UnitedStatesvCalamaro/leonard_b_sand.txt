mr.
leonard
b.
sand
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
on
certiorari
to
the
third
circuit
under
the
federal
wagering
tax
and
presents
the
question
whether
a
numbers
pick-up
man
is
subject
to
the
occupational
stamp
tax
which
is
imposed
upon
persons
who
receive
wagers
for
or
on
behalf
of
any
person
who
is
subject
to
the
excise
tax.
the
third
circuit
has
decided
that
a
pick-up
man
is
not
subject
to
such
a
tax.
this
decision
is
in
direct
conflict
with
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
sagonias
v.
united
states,
223
f.2d
146,
certiorari
denied
350
u.s.840.
to
resolve
this
conflict,
the
government
petitioned
for
certiorari
which
this
court
granted.congress
in
1951
enacted
two
new
taxes
to
deal
with
professional
gambling.
the
first
of
these
taxes
was
the
excise
tax
which
is
set
forth
on
page
3
of
the
government's
brief.
this
was
a
10%
excise
task
and
subdivision
(d)
of
section
3285
provides
that
each
person
who
is
engaged
in
the
business
of
accepting
wagers
shall
be
liable
for
and
shall
pay
the
tax
under
this
subchapter
on
all
wagers
placed
with
him.
the
legislative
history
of
this
section
indicates
that
it
was
designed
to
cover
the
person
who
acted
in
the
role
of
the
principal
who
accepted
wagers
on
his
own
account
and
to
--
for
the
risk
of
profit
or
loss
on
such
wagers.
the
government
concedes
that
the
defendant
in
this
case
was
not
such
a
person
and
so
the
excise
tax
is
not
the
tax
with
which
we
are
primarily
concerned
in
this
case.
however,
the
second
tax
imposed
in
subchapter
b,
the
occupational
tax
was
imposed
on
a
broader
member
of
persons.
section
3290
provides,
reading
from
page
three
of
the
government's
brief,
"a
special
tax
of
$50
per
year
shall
be
paid
by
each
person
who
is
liable
for
tax
under
subchapter
a,"
interpolating
that
is
each
person
who
functions
in
the
role
of
the
--
of
the
principal,
the
banker,
the
man
who
has
the
risk
of
profit
or
loss
or
the
statute
continues,
"who
is
engaged
in
receiving
wagers
for
or
on
behalf
of
any
person
so
liable."
and
the
question
in
--
in
this
case
is
whether
a
pick-up
man
is
engaged
in
receiving
wagers
for
or
on
behalf
of
such
a
person.
the
penalty
provision
is
contained
in
section
3294,
cited
on
page
4
of
the
government's
brief
and
provides
that
any
person
who
does
an
act
which
makes
him
liable
for
the
tax
without
having
paid
such
tax
shall
be
fined
not
less
than
$1000
nor
more
than
$5000.
it
was
for
violation
of
this
penalty
section
that
an
information
was
filed
against
the
defendant
in
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania.
at
that
trial,
which
was
before
a
jury,
evidence
was
presented
by
philadelphia
policemen
who
are
experts
in
the
operation
of
the
numbers
racket
in
the
city
of
philadelphia.
the
evidence
indicated
that
the
practices
followed
in
the
numbers
game
were
fairly-well
standardized.
a
person
wishing
to
place
a
--
a
wager
in
the
numbers
game
would
not
come
in
direct
contact
with
the
banker
or
the
principal,
rather
he
would
come
in
direct
contact
with
the
person
known
as
the
writer
and
would
tell
the
writer
the
three-digit
number
on
wish
--
on
which
he
wish
to
make
a
bet
and
would
give
the
money
to
the
writer.
the
writer
would
keep
a
book
which
was
a
triplicate
form
book
and
on
this
book
he
would
indicate
the
number
which
was
selected
by
the
player
and
the
amount
which
the
--
was
to
be
wagered.
the
writer
would
keep
for
his
own
records
a
white
copy
of
this
record,
would
give
to
the
player
a
tissue
carbon
copy.
there
would
then
remain
a
third
copy
which
is
a
yellow
copy
and
which
would
ultimately
be
turned
over
to
the
pick-up
man.
the
pick-up
man's
function
was
to
operate
as
a
liaison
between
the
bank,
the
principal,
and
the
writers.
he
would
daily
collect
from
the
writers
these
yellow
pick-up
slips
and
would
deliver
them
to
the
bank
or
banker
prior
to
the
time
towards
the
end
of
each
day
when
the
winning
number
would
be
determined.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
a
writer
would
work
for
one
bank.
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
no,
your
honor.
the
pick-up
man
would
circulate
among
various
writers.
the
writers
would
usually
be
people
who
would
come
in
contact
with
the
public
such
as
bootblacks
or
news
dealers.
the
pick-up
man,
working
for
one
bank
or
banker,
would
circulate
the
various
writers
who
also
work
for
that
bank
and
would
deliver
the
slips,
which
he
collects
from
the
various
writers,
to
the
bank.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
--
the
general
practice
is
for
the
pick-up
man
to
work
for
one
bank.
the
practice
in
philadelphia
at
--
at
this
time
which
was
in
october
1952
was
for
the
payoff
to
be
made
if
--
if
a
--
a
player
had
selected
a
number
which
came
out
for
that
day
from
the
bank
directly
to
the
writer
and
from
the
writer
to
the
--
to
the
player.
evidence
was
also
adduced
at
the
trial
that
the
defendant
was
apprehended
on
a
state
charge
by
philadelphia
policemen
and
that
he
had
in
his
position
at
that
time
yellow
banker
slips
of
the
type
i
have
just
described
representing
1800
separate
bets.
the
defendant
admitted
that
he
was
engaged
in
picking
up
numbers
and
that
he
had
been
so
engaged
for
three
months,
and
said
that
he
was
employed
at
a
salary
of
$40
a
week.
the
defendant
was
indicted
in
the
local
court,
the
court
of
quarter
sessions
in
philadelphia
and
pled
guilty
to
a
charge
of
maintaining
a
lottery
and
was
fined.
evidence
was
also
adduced
to
the
effect
that
he
did
not
have
the
occupational
stamp
tax,
and
with
this
evidence
before
the
jury
rendered
a
verdict
of
guilty,
the
third
circuit
by
a
divided
court
reversed.
in
disagreeing
with
the
fifth
circuit
and
holding
that
a
pick-up
man
does
not
receive
wagers,
the
third
circuit
took
the
view
that
the
placing
of
a
wager
by
the
player
and
the
receipt
of
the
wager
were
two
sides
of
a
single
coin
and
that
by
the
time
the
pick-up
man
entered
the
picture,
the
wager
had
been
placed.
and
so
that
rather
than
receiving
a
--
a
wager,
the
pick-up
man
receive
merely
the
record
of
a
wager.
the
government
respectfully
submits
that
the
language,
purpose,
and
administrative
interpretation
of
this
statute
all
lead
to
a
--
or
support
a
contrary
result.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
is
an
end
to
the
liability
depending
upon
the
function
which
is
performed
by
the
individual
with
respect
to
the
--
to
the
secretary
or
bookkeeper
who
performs
no
role
in
channeling
the
wager
from
the
player
to
the
bank.
the
treasury
regulations
recognize
that
the
occupational
stamp
tax
would
not
apply.
but
one
might
--
and
in
fact,
there
exists
situations
where
there
are
several
intermediaries,
all
of
whom
serve
to
--
to
transfer
the
wager
from
the
player
to
the
--
to
the
bank
to
--
to
avoid
apprehension
by
local
and
federal
authorities,
various
schemes
have
been
setup
through
the
use
of
--
of
intermediaries.
but
if
the
role
performed
by
the
--
by
the
person
working
for
the
bank
is
one
of
transmission
of
the
wager
from
the
player
to
the
ultimate
source,
the
bank,
then
the
government
submits
such
a
person
is
--
receives
wagers
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes,
mr.
justice
burton.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
if
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
government
submits
that
the
key
error
of
the
third
circuit
is
that
emphasis
was
placed
by
it
on
the
--
on
the
player,
on
the
better
rather
than
on
the
banking
side
of
the
transaction.
but
the
statue
specifically
speaks
of
persons
receiving
wagers
for
or
on
behalf
of
any
person
liable
to
the
excise
tax,
not
on
receiving
wagers
from
the
betters.
the
difference
between
this
statute
and
the
type
of
statute
which
does
focus
on
the
better
or
player
is
perhaps
best
demonstrated
by
reference
to
the
lottery
statute.
the
statute
found
in
18
u.s.c.
section
1301
which
prohibits
interstate
transportation
of
lottery
tickets.
that
statute
prohibits
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
in,
"any
paper,
certificate,
or
instrument
purporting
to
be
or
to
represent
a
ticket,
chance
share,
or
interest
in
or
dependent
upon
the
event
of
a
lottery.‚Äù
this
court
in
francis
against
united
states
in
188
u.s.375
construed
that
statute
and
held
that
the
carrying
across
state
lines
of
slips,
which
were
the
equivalent
of
the
yellow
pick-up
slips
in
this
case,
did
not
violate
the
statute
because
they
were
not
purchases
documents.
they
did
not
stand
as
the
representative
of
title
to
the
purchases
of
interest.
but
in
contrast
to
this
statute,
the
governing
factor
is
not
the
interest
of
the
purchaser
but
rather
the
--
the
interest
of
the
banker,
the
transmission
on
the
banking
side
of
this
transaction
nor
does
the
statute
in
speaking
of
receiving
wagers
for
or
on
behalf
of
any
person
have
reference
to
contract
concepts
and
other
provisions
in
the
statute,
reference
is
made
to
the
placing
of
a
wager
or
the
acceptance
of
a
wager.
significantly,
with
respect
to
this
provision
of
the
occupational
tax,
the
broader
term
receiving
wagers
is
used.
and
indeed
in
the
--
in
the
parlance
of
the
numbers
rackets,
the
slips
themselves
are
said
to
contain
the
bets.
the
philadelphia
policemen,
who
described
the
operation
of
these
numbers
racket
and
who
apprehended
the
defendant,
themselves
said
that
the
numbers
contained
the
bets.
and
of
course
the
--
the
numbers
are
on
the
slips
which
are
admittedly
received
by
the
--
by
the
pick-up
man.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan.
and
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan.
if
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
if
the
slip
were
physically
at
the
bank,
so
that
the
only
service
performed
by
the
particular
agent
of
the
--
of
the
bank
were
--
were
--
was
a
clerical
function
then
there
would
be
no
liability.
and
that
--
that
is
the
--
the
interpretation
which
is
placed
on
the
statute
by
the
--
by
the
treasury
regulation
which
is
set
forth
in
respondent's
brief
at
--
at
page
4.
the
hypothetical
there
is
as
follows.
example
one,
a
person
is
engaged
in
the
business
of
accepting
horse
bets
or
horse
race
bets.
he
employs
10
persons
to
receive,
on
his
behalf,
wagers
which
are
transmitted
by
telephone.
he
also
employs
a
secretary
and
a
bookkeeper.
(a)
in
each
of
the
10
persons
who
receive
wagers
by
telephone
are
liable
for
the
special
tax.
the
secretary
and
bookkeeper
are
not
liable
unless
they
also
receive
wagers
for
him.
in
the
second
example
which
is
given
in
the
treasury
regulation,
the
situation
of
the
pick-up
man
is
clearly
covered.
there,
the
example
is
as
follows,
(b)
operates
a
numbers
games.
he
has
an
arrangement
with
10
persons
who
are
employed
in
various
capacities,
such
as
bootblacks,
elevator
operators,
news
dealers,
et
cetera
--
et
cetera
to
receive
wagers
from
the
public
on
his
behalf.(b)
also
employs
a
person
to
collect
from
his
agents
the
wagers
received
on
his
behalf.
(b)
his
10
agents,
and
the
employee
who
collects
the
wagers
received
on
his
behalf
are
each
liable
for
the
special
tax.
this
regulation
went
into
effect
on
november
1,
1951,
which
was
the
effective
date
of
the
statute.
and
congress
in
1954
has
reenacted
the
statute
and
reenacted
this
particular
provision
verbatim.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
that
--
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
burton.
and
the
--
the
situation
of
the
relay
of
the
several
intermediaries
was
considered
by
congress,
and
the
--
the
report
of
the
committee
on
this
bill
is
significant
in
that
respect.
the
occupational
tax
was
enacted
as
a
--
an
enforcement
device
for
the
more
important
excise
tax.
and
the
committee
report
in
making
reference
to
the
occupational
tax
in
language,
which
appears
in
page
18
of
the
government's
brief,
stated
that
the
--
the
committee
consists
of
the
occupational
tax
as
an
integral
part
of
any
plan
for
the
taxation
of
wagers
and
is
essential
to
the
collection
and
enforcement
of
such
a
tax.
enforcement
of
a
tax
on
wagers
frequently
will
necessitate
the
tracing
of
transactions
to
complex
business
relationships,
thus
requiring
the
identification
of
the
various
steps
involved.
for
this
reason,
the
committee
report
continues,
the
bill
provides
that
a
person
who
pays
the
occupational
tax
must,
as
part
of
his
registration,
identify
those
persons
who
are
engaged
in
receiving
wagers
for
or
on
his
behalf.
and
in
addition,
identify
the
person
whose
--
on
whose
behalf
he
is
engaged
in
receiving
wagers.
the
section
3291
of
title
26
contains
the
registration
provision
which
is
a
part
of
the
structure
of
the
occupational
stamp
tax,
and
this
requires
that
every
person
who
is
subject
to
the
excise
tax
register
the
name
and
place
of
residence
of
each
person
who
is
engaged
in
receiving
wagers
for
him
or
on
his
behalf.
and
if
he
is
engaged
in
receiving
wagers
for
or
on
behalf
of
any
person
liable
for
the
tax,
the
excise
tax,
then
he
too
must
register.
in
other
words,
the
consequence
of
a
--
of
a
holding
that
a
pick-up
man
does
not
receive
wagers
is
to
remove
the
pick-up
man
from
the
scope
of
the
registration
provisions.
and
therefore,
defeat
the
congressional
purpose
of
enabling
the
tracing
of
the
various
transactions
in
the
professional
gambling
activity
so
that
the
excise
tax
might
be
enforced.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
the
plain
--
the
plain
truth
of
--
of
it,
mr.
justice
harlan,
is
as
--
as
the
committee
stated
that
the
purpose
of
the
occupational
tax
was
to
enforce
the
excise
tax.
the
question
whether
the
--
whether
the
tax
is
a
means
of
regulating
professional
gambling
or
it's
a
revenue
measure
was
of
course
treated
by
this
court
in
kahriger
and
lewis,
and
the
constitutionality
of
these
provisions
was
sustained.
the
--
the
pick-up
man
is
not
as
the
third
circuit
thought
a
minor
functionary.
he
is
of
course
the
direct
emissary
of
the
--
of
the
banker,
a
man
from
a
headquarters,
judge
mclaughlin
called
him
in
--
in
dissenting.
and
we
think
that
the
language
of
the
statute,
legislative
history
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
all
support
the
conclusion
that
a
pick-up
man
is
a
person
receiving
wagers.
a
contrary
result
as
mr.
--
as
judge
mclaughlin
pointed
out
in
dissent
would
make
it
a
relatively
easy
matter
for
somebody
apprehended
with
gambling
paraphernalia
to
immediately
invoke
the
alibi
that
--
that
his
role
was
merely
that
of
a
--
of
a
pick-up
man.
the
government
submits
that
the
decision
below
is
erroneous
and
should
be
reversed.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
mr.
chief
justice.
with
reference
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
whether
people
in
fact
registered
under
the
statute,
the
answer
is
yes,
they
in
fact
do.
in
1952,
some

mr.

the
--
the
figures
have
gone
down.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes,
gone
down.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
with
respect
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question
as
to
the
production
of
revenue
under
the
statute,
under
the
excise
tax
in
1953,
some
$9.5
million
revenue
is
produced.
and
the
excise
tax
has
produced
in
1953
974,000,
in
1954
some
$1
million.
with
respect
to
whether
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
occupational
tax?
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
that's
--
that
is
at
$50.
produced
in
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
produced
in
1953,
$974,000,
in
1954,
$1,008,000.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
that
the
statute
was
a
--
a
valid
revenue
measure
as
--
as
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes.
i
think
--
i
think
there
is
at
--
at
this
point,
no
question
that
--
that
this
is
a
revenue
statute
and
the
constitutionality
of
which
has
--
has
been
sustained
and
government
points
to
the
fact
that
it
has
--
it
has,
in
fact,
produced
revenue
as
a
revenue
statute
should.
with
--
with
respect
to
whether
the
defendant
was
a
writer
or
a
runner,
the
court
below
referred
to
him
as
a
runner.
and
of
course,
the
examples
in
the
treasury
regulations
indicate
that
the
writers
are
person
such
as
news
dealers,
bootblacks,
who
remain
in
one
--
one
place
and
the
pick-up
man
is,
of
course,
the
man
who
literally
runs,
who
goes
from
place
to
place
collecting
these
slips.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
would
have
some
difficulty
in
all
candid,
mr.
justice
brennan,
where
the
sole
function
performed
by
the
moneyman,
who
--
who
in
this
area
is
--
is
known
as
the
bagman,
where
his
sole
function
was
distribution
of
winnings
whether
that
was
receiving
wagers.
in
fact,
the
--
the
person
who
handles
the
funds
also
collects
money
from
the
writer
and
distributes
the
payoff.
and
i
would
say
that
such
a
person
receive
wagers
within
the
meaning
of
--
of
the
statute
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
where
--
i
--
i
think
i
would
resolve
the
question
by
saying
that
he
--
he
was
a
person
who
serves
in
the
transmission
function.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
it's
the
government's
position
that
any
agent
of
the
banker
who
serves
to
transmit
the
wager
from
the
player
to
the
banker
is
a
person
who
receives
wagers.
my
--
my
only
hesitation
is
because
that
is
the
--
your
hypothetical
is
the
outgoing
transaction.
i
would
think
there
that
--
that
both
the
in-going
and
the
out-going
transaction
would
be
subject
to
--
to
the
statute.
