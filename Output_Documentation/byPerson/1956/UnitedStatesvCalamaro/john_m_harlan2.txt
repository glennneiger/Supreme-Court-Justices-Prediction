does
a
writer
only
work
for
one
bank?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
the
pick-up
man
works
for
one
writer
and
one
bank?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
i
meant
was
the
pick-up
man
doesn't
work
for
banks
and
writers
generally.
he
works
with
the
two
elements
of
the
single
operation.
justice
john
m.
harlan
under
your
view,
i
suppose
the
writer
is
also
subject
to
this
tax
as
a
receiver
of
a
wager?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
then
the
--
you
say
the
pick-up
man
is,
but
you
say
the
clerk
of
the
bank
who
receives
the
slip
from
the
pick-up
man
and
puts
it
down
on
a
ledger
or
whatever
record
they
keep
would
not
be
liable
for
receiving
the
wagers.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
your
theory?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you're
really
more
interested
in
registration
than
tax,
isn't
that
the
plain
truth
to
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
claim
that
the
banker
is
or
is
not
subject
to
the
receiving
tax?
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
is
somewhat
ought
to
being
but
i
was
just
interested.
do
any
of
these
people
register?
justice
john
m.
harlan
perhaps,
the
government?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
both
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
do
you
do
if
senator
kefauver's
statement,
who
is
somewhat
of
an
expert
on
this
subject
at
that
time.
the
government
quotes
page
19
in
their
brief.he
says
that
under
these
proposals,
bookmakers,
the
numbers
operators,
their
agents
and
runners
would
register
with
the
internal
revenue?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
runner
means
the
writer,
does
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
he
was
a
stationary,
probably
just
--
is
there
to
receive
bet?
