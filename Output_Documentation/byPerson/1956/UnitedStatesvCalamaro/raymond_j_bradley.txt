mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government,
i
think,
has
outlined
very
faithfully
the
factual
situation
as
developed
in
the
record
from
the
court
below
and
in
the
trial
court.
the
government's
position
seems
to
be
that
since
the
respondent,
a
pick-up
man,
is
a
part
of
the
gambling
operation
and
performs
a
vital
function
in
that
operation
that
he
must
therefore
fall
within
the
terms
of
section
3290
because
congress
intended
the
statute
to
apply
to
anyone
engaged
in
any
vital
phase
of
the
gambling
operation.
i
think
this
attempts
to
make
the
statute
do
more
than
what
it
was
passed
to
do
because
essentially
it
is
a
position
that
--
that
congress
in
enacting
this
statute
sought
to
make
it
coextensive
with
the
various
state
statutes
which
was
--
which
regulate
and
punish
gambling,
and
that
under
this
statute,
anyone
who
would
be
liable
for
criminal
penalties
for
violation
of
state
gambling
statutes
would
also
be
liable
for
the
tax.
i
was
somewhat
interested
in
the
answer
which
counsel
for
the
government
gave
to
the
question
put
by
the
court
as
to
where
he
would
cutoff
this
liability
for
in
reading
his
brief
at
page
11,
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
position
taken
there
was
that
this
tax
would
apply
to
anyone
who
had
a
part
in
the
gambling
operation
regardless
of
what
that
part
was.
if
the
government,
however,
now
seeks
to
limit
the
application
then
i
think
we
must
be
faced
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
limitation,
which
it
now
concedes,
makes
any
sense.
now,
first
of
all,
i
think
we
must
consider
just
what
it
was
that
the
respondent
here
did
and
what
part
he
does
perform
in
this
gambling
operation.
he
has
no
contact
whatsoever
with
the
numbers
player,
the
person
who
makes
the
bet.
he
doesn't
carry
any
money
either
from
the
writer
to
the
bank
or
from
the
bank
back
to
the
writer
and
eventually
to
the
numbers
player.
all
he
does
is
handle
the
slips,
the
records
which
are
made
of
the
gambling
transaction.
and
in
doing
so
his
function
is
that
of
a
messenger.
he
circulates
between
the
bank
and
the
writer
and
brings
records
which
concededly
are
necessary
in
the
operation
of
this
lottery
but
which,
we
submit,
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
wager
as
such.
and
i
think
that
in
analysis
of
the
statute
makes
this
clear.
in
the
first
place,
we
must
notice
that
under
section
3285
(a)
which
deals
with
the
excise
tax.
this
is
a
tax
imposed
--
the
excise
tax
is
a
tax
imposed
on
wagers.
obviously,
it
makes
the
bet
the
important
thing.
in
discussing
the
liability
for
the
excise
tax,
it's
again
the
liability
of
anyone
who
accepts
wagers
and
wagers
is
again
the
central
word
which
determines
liability
for
the
excise
tax.
in
determining
credits
against
the
excise
tax,
again
it
refers
to
the
laying
off
of
wagers
by
one
person
who
accepts
them
initially
with
another
person.
finally,
it
defines
a
wager
as
any
wager
placed
in
a
lottery
conducted
for
profit,
focusing
therefore
on
the
transaction
which
gives
rise
to
the
bet.
the
transaction
by
means
of
which
the
numbers
player
on
the
one
hand
and
the
bank
on
the
other
hand
become
committed,
and
the
agency
by
which
this
transaction
is
consummated
is
not
the
pick-up
man,
it
is
the
writer.
it
is
in
this
sense,
we
submit,
that
when
the
statute
talks
of
receiving
wagers
on
behalf
of
a
banker
that
the
term
is
used.
the
person
who
receives
the
wager
is
the
person
through
whose
agency
the
wagering
transaction
is
consummated.
from
that
point
on,
the
wager
is
completed
and
from
that
point
on,
any
dealings
with
whatever
results
is
not
a
dealing
with
the
wager.
what
you're
doing
from
that
point
on
is
conducting
a
bookkeeping
function
insofar
as
the
bank
and
its
operations
are
concerned.
now,
when
congress
passed
section
3290,
it
carefully
chose
its
words.
had
it
desired
to
make
the
liability
for
the
occupational
tax
extend
beyond
the
person
who
has
the
contact
with
the
better,
beyond
the
numbers
writer
who
admittedly
is
subject
to
the
occupational
tax,
it
would
not
have
used
the
word
"receiving
wagers."
he
could
have
accomplished
this
by
saying
any
employee
of
the
banker
or
any
agent
of
the
banker.
and
essentially,
what
the
government
argues
is
that
because
the
pick-up
man
is
an
agent
of
the
bank
and
performs
as,
that
agent,
a
vital
function
then
he
must
be
subject
to
the
act
because
congress
wanted
to
get
that
anyone
who
performed
a
vital
function
in
this
operation.
but
we
submit
as
the
third
circuit
held
that
in
considering
the
interpretation
of
the
phrase
"receiving
wagers,"
we
must
consider
that
we
cannot
just
isolate
the
word
"receive"
and
say
as
the
government
does
receive
has
many,
many
meanings.
we
must
focus
upon
what
it
is
that
has
been
received
and
the
statute
very
explicitly
says
it's
the
wager.
and
then
by
reference
to
the
definition
of
wager
which
consists
of
the
placing
of
the
wager
in
the
lottery
pool,
we
see
that
the
receiving
of
the
wager
and
the
placing
of
the
wager
are,
as
the
court
below
put
it,
two
sides
of
the
same
coin
and
when
the
wager
has
been
placed,
the
receipt
of
it
has
been
accomplished.
and
from
then
on
we
are
not
any
longer
dealing
with
a
receipt
of
wager.
now,
the
government
says
that
to
do
this,
we
give
it
this
interpretation,
would
defeat
the
congressional
purpose.
and
in
the
sagonias
case,
the
case
which
arose
in
the
fifth
circuit,
where
they
held
that
the
pick-up
man
was
liable
for
the
occupational
tax,
the
same
argument
was
made.
but
a
reading
of
the
fifth
circuit
case
would
indicate
that
that
court
had
difficulty
coming
to
its
conclusion
because
as
i
read
it
they
admitted
that
the
express
wording
of
the
statute
didn't
cover
the
pick-up
man.
it
clearly
covered
the
numbers
writer,
but
not
the
pick-up
man.
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
the
banker
is
because
the
statute
specifically
makes
him
liable,
sir.
because
in
section
3290,
the
statute
says
that
the
occupational
tax
shall
be
paid
by
everyone
who
is
liable
for
the
excise
tax,
which
is
the
banker,
and
anyone
who
receives
wagers
on
his
behalf.
and
i
think
there
again
it's
indicative
of
what
the
meaning
of
the
term
“receiving
wagers”
is
concerned.
because
to
get
the
banker
in,
they
specifically
said
he
is
in
because
he
is
one
who
is
liable
to
the
excise
tax,
and
then
they
say
also
those
receiving
wagers
on
his
behalf.
if
they
weren't
using
receiving
wagers
in
the
restricted
sense
that
i
have
used
it,
they
could
have
said
and
that
anybody
who
receives
wagers
that
would
then
if
--
if
their
intent
was
to
include
the
banker
under
those
words,
then
you
might
say
that
receiving
wagers
has
the
interpretation
which
the
government
seeks
to
give
it.
but
congress
used
these
words
“accepting”
and
“receiving”
i
believe
in
a
very
restricted
sense
as
the
wording
of
this
act
indicates.
and
as
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
sagonias
case,
i
believe,
was
forced
to
admit.
and
then
faced
with
the
--
the
--
their
own
interpretation
that
the
express
wording
did
not
cover
the
pick-up
man
then
they
had
reference
to
some
broad
general
policy
which
they
said
was
inherent
in
this
act
and
said
that
unless
we
included
the
pick-up
man,
then
we
would
defeat
this
broad
general
purpose.
now,
on
--
in
his
argument,
counsel
for
the
government
says
that
when
the
pick-up
man
comes
to
the
bank
and
delivers
these
slips,
which
he
has,
to
some
other
functionary
of
the
gambling
operation
that
that
second
functionary
is
not
liable
for
this
tax.
he
gets
the
very
same
thing
that
the
writer
got,
he
gets
the
slips.
and
with
them,
he
performs
certain
functions
necessary
to
the
operation.
now,
they
said
the
pick-up
man
who
has
only
the
slips
is
liable,
but
the
person
to
whom
he
delivers
the
very
same
things
which
make
him
liable
is
not
liable.
now,
the
treasury
takes
that
position
too
in
its
regulations.
we
submit
that
that
distinction
cannot
be
justified.
how
you
can
say
that
one
who
handles
the
slips
must
pay
the
tax
and
another
who
handles
the
very
same
thing
need
not
pay
the
tax
is
something
which
is
difficult
to
understand
and
appreciate.
the
government,
i
think,
is
relying
basically
on
the
dictum
which
occurred
in
the
case
daley
versus
--
versus
the
united
states,
a
decision
in
the
first
circuit
in
231
f.2d
123.
there,
the
court
said
that
in
approving
a
charge
which
was
directed
not
at
this
question
but
at
another
issue
in
the
case,
the
court
said
that
anyone
who
has
anything
to
do
with
the
numbers
operation
is
engaged
in
the
business
and
in
conducting
a
lottery.
now,
if
that
interpretation
were
taken,
it
would
make
the
pick-up
man
not
only
liable
for
the
occupational
tax
but
liable
also
for
the
excise
tax.
now,
the
government
concedes
that
he
is
not
liable
for
the
excise
tax
but
they
would
like
to
use
that
same
theory,
which
they
say
is
wrong,
to
impose
liability
for
the
occupational
tax
which
is
involved
here.
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
under
the
evidence
in
this
case,
sir,
the
record
shows
that
it
is
the
writer
who
delivers
the
winnings.
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
the
record
in
this
case
indicates
that
he
gets
that
directly
from
the
banker.
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
i
don't
believe
so.
no,
sir.
because
i
don't
think
there
that
he
is
receiving
a
wager.
what
he
is
doing
is
distributing
winnings.
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
he
would
--
he
would
if
you
took
the
very
broad
theory
that
anyone
who
has
any
function
to
perform
in
this
operation
at
all
is
liable.
but
then
i
think
that
congress
would
not
have
used
those
very
careful
words
“receiving
wagers”.
it
would
have
said
any
employee
of
one
liable
for
the
excise
tax
or
any
agent
of
one
liable
for
the
excise
tax.
and
basically,
that's
what
the
government
comes
down
to
saying
that
since
he's
an
agent,
he
must
be
liable
because
the
banker
is
liable
and
the
writer
is
liable
and
this
fellow
just
an
agent
which
--
who
operates
between
them.
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
what
--
you
mean
for
the
--
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
in
the
state
statute?
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
i
believe,
justice
brennan,
and
this
--
this
individual
here
was
of
course
liable
and
had
pleaded
guilty
to
a
violation
of
the
pennsylvania
lottery
statutes.
but
those
statutes
are
quite
broad
and
cover
anyone
concerned
in
the
operation
of
a
lottery
and
what
the
government
seeks
to
do
is
make
this
statute
coextensive
with
those.
now,
this
statute
was
upheld
as
a
taxing
measure,
not
as
a
measure
regulating
gambling.
and
in
the
kahriger
case,
the
court
alluded
to
the
difficulties
of
constitutionality
which
might
arise
by
attempting
to
make
this
statute
coextensive
with
the
gambling
tax
--
with
the
gambling
statutes
of
the
states.
now,
i
think
that
that
was
one
of
the
concerns
of
congress
that
it
did
not
go
too
far
in
this
thing
so
as
to
bring
the
--
what
was
conceived
off
as
a
taxing
measure
into
the
realm
of
the
regulation
of
gambling
and
therefore
raised
serious
doubts
as
to
its
constitutionality.
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
sir?
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
no,
sir.
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
now,
the
legislative
--
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
correct
sir,
i
think
they
would
have
used
the
words
which
would
have
clearly
indicated
that
agents
or
employees
were
concerned
in.
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
well,
it
knew
what
it
was
dealing
with
here.
this
came
up
after
--
after
a
long
investigation
of
gambling
and
if
--
they
wanted
to
make
clear
that
this
extended
to
every
phase
of
gambling,
i
think
they
would
have
used
words
which
made
that
abundantly
clear
and
not
words
which
were
limited
to
wagers.
and
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history,
i
think
the
most
significant
part
of
the
legislative
history
is
what
occurs
in
the
committee
report
in
discussing
this
operation,
where
they
say
that
--
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
i'm
reading
now
from
page
17
and
18
of
my
brief,
sir.
“the
principals
in
such
transactions
are
commonly
referred
to
as
bookmakers,
although
it
is
not
intended
that
any
technical
definition
of
bookmakers
such
as
the
maintenance
of
a
handbook
or
other
device
for
the
recording
of
wagers
be
required.”
and
now
comes
this
language,
“it
is
intended
that
a
wager
be
considered
as
placed
with
a
principal
when
it
has
been
placed
with
other
persons
acting
for
him.
persons
who
receive
bets
for
principals
are
sometimes
known
as
bookmakers,
agents,
or
runners.”
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
well,
according
to
the
statute
it
is,
because
the
statute
specifically
--
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
oh,
i
think
there,
they
--
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
this
is
in
the
--
in
the
--
well,
it
appears
both
in
the
house
and
senate
report
on
the
bill,
the
same
--
same
language
in
both
places.
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
the
liability
of
the
banker
becomes
fixed
at
the
moment
the
bet
is
placed
with
the
writer
according
to
both
the
terms
of
the
statute
and
the
terms
of
the
treasury
regulations.
and
that's
why
i
say
that
we're
dealing
here
with
words
used
in
a
restricted
sense.
we're
not
dealing
here
with
words
which
were
just
used
quite
broadly
and
without
giving
any
fact
to
them.
they
were
being
used
in
--
in
the
sense
in
which
the
statute
was
drawn
and
were
keyed
into
all
of
the
provisions
of
the
statute
dealing
with
liability.
now,
all
that
the
government
points
to
is
a
--
an
ambiguous
reference
to
the
fact
that
you've
got
a
lot
of
subagents
which
occurs
in
two
of
the
speeches
that
were
made.
one
of
which
by
senator
kefauver,
which
was
a
speech
in
opposition
to
this
bill
and
the
other
by
representative
reed,
which
contains
merely
a
passing
reference
to
the
gambling
tax
and
of
course
it's
a
very
long
speech
which
dealt
with
the
whole
revenue
act
of
1951.
and
then
they
say,
but
if
you
look
at
the
registration
provisions
and
they
say
that
the
occupational
tax
was
designed
to
key
in
with
the
registration
provisions,
then
you
say
--
you
must
say
that
everybody
who
has
a
--
takes
one
step
in
this
whole
transaction
is
covered
by
the
tax.
but
as
the
evidence
here
indicates,
what
happens
is
the
writer
takes
the
bet.
now,
the
writer
registered
and
--
and
tells
the
bankers
for
whom
he
operates.
the
banker
registers
and
tells
the
writers
who
operate
for
him
and
we've
got
the
whole
transaction
in
that
--
those
two
registrations
and
the
tracing
of
this
thing
is
therefore
complete.
the
interposition
of
the
pick-up
man
between
the
writer
and
the
banker
happens
to
be,
perhaps,
a
convenient
way
for
these
people
to
operate,
it
is
by
no
means
and
essential
to
the
basic
transaction
of
wagering
and
is
by
no
means
necessary
to
the
tracing
of
the
transaction.
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
well,
but
--
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
so,
because
the
writer
has
to
register.
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
and
the
banker
has
to
register
and
then
(voice

--
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
what
you're
saying
then
is
because
the
writer
may
not
register
or
because
the
banker
may
not
register
or
reveal
all
of
his
writers,
then
we
have
to
put
in
this
pick-up
man.
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
well,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
oh,
i
don't
think
so,
sir.
i
think
that
in
any
event
you
--
you
have
to
face
the
question
that
if
--
if
people
do
not
register,
you're
going
to
have
difficulty
of
enforcing
this.
now,
if
it's
the
writer
who
does
not
register,
that
makes
it
a
little
bit
difficult.
if
it's
the
banker
who
does
not
register,
that
increases
the
difficulties.
but
just
to
say
that
therefore
if
we
make
the
pick-up
man
register,
you
can
reduce
those
difficulties.
i
don't
think
that
follows
because
you've
got
the
same
problem,
he
might
not
register
either.
and
certainly
if
you
had
every
single
person
that
had
anything
to
do
with
this
register,
that
decreases
the
possibilities
of
avoidance
even
more.
but
as
the
government
now
concede
--
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
but
then
you've
got
your
face
with
the
fact
that
under
the
regulation
they
don't
push
it
that
far.
the
government
now
does
not
seek
to
push
it
that
far
and
they're
just
limiting
it
to
this
three
--
three
different
type
--
categories
of
individuals.
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
i
--
that's
rather
difficult
to
say,
sir.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
--
there
have
been
many
registrations.
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
i've
made
no
search
of
that.
one
of
the
kahriger
cases
involved
a
registration
where
the
man
went
in
and
said,
“i'll
register,
but
i
won't
answer
all
these
questions
you
want
me
to
ask.”
they
wouldn't
take
his
registration
under
those
circumstances
and
then
he
was
prosecuted.but
my
guess
is
that
there
are
not
too
many
registrations
and
the
revenue
expectations
of
this
act,
i
believe,
have
fallen
much
below
the
$400
million
which
was
bandied
about
in
the
congressional
report.
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
no,
sir.
i
can't
that.
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
i
--
i
can't
answer,
but
i
--
i
remember
at
one
time
seeing
some
figure
which,
if
my
recollection
is
correct,
was
somewhere
in
the
$4
or
$5
million
but
that's
just
a
hazy
recollection.
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
well,
i
think
what
he
was
referring
to
was
the
writer.
he's
--
he's
the
--
he's
the
agent
or
runner
and
if
it's
in
that
sense,
if
you'll
notice
the
--
the
reference
--
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
yes,
sir.
the
--
the
writer
is
the
runner.
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
oh,
no,
sir.
the
writer
circulate
all
around
as
the
evidence
indicates
the
meeting
which
results
in
the
bet.
they
come
about
in
many
ways,
the
writer
may
come
to
the
--
the
better
may
come
to
the
writer
or
the
writer
may
circulate
through
the
neighborhood.
he
sometimes
has
steady
customers
and
he
knows
that
if
he
calls
upon
them
all,
he
may
well
receive
a
bet
for
that
day.
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
that's
--
i
think
so,
sir.
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
(voice

to
brokerage
house
--
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
--
to
brokerage
house.
he's
the
one
referred
to
as
a
runner
because
--
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
oh,
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
saying
that
you
can't
refer
to
the
pick-up
man
as
a
runner.
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
well,
i
--
no,
i
didn't
mean
to
convey
that.
what
i
meant
to
say
is
that
the
term
runner
includes
writer,
it
also
includes
pick-up
man
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
well,
it's
pretty
difficult
to
say
what
he
--
what
sense
he
was
using
it
in.
and
i
think
you
must
remember
that
this
was
a
speech
made
in
our
position
to
this
bill.
it
was
not
made
in
an
attempt
to
delineate
what
the
bill
was
covering
and
senator
kefauver
sought
to
have
this
bill
defeated.
i
think
that
trying
to
take
whatever
he
may
have
meant
and
read
that
into
the
act
just
can't
be
done
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
yes.
and
then
--
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
yes,
sir.
especially,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
kefauver
was
attempting
to
get
the
measure
defeated.
and
therefore,
was
saying
everything
he
possibly
could
to
indicate
all
of
the
difficulties
that
might
be
encountered
in
the
--
mr.
raymond
j.
bradley
he
did.
he
wanted
to
defeat
gambling.
yes,
sir.
but
we
submit,
sir,
that
even
when
you
take
a
look
at
the
treasury
regulations,
although
the
example
which
was
cited
in
the
government's
brief
and
also
which
is
set
forth
on
page
4
of
our
brief,
covers
the
pick-up
man.
it
does
so,
it
seems
to
me,
by
just
pulling
itself
up
by
its
own
bootstraps
and
assuming
that
what
he
gets
is
the
receipt
of
the
wager
and
that's
the
very
question
that
we
have
involved.
now,
if
you
look
at
other
sections
of
the
act
--
of
the
regulations,
particularly
the
section
325.24,
which
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
on
page
2
and
3.
i
believe
that
the
treasury
there
accepts
our
proposition
that
the
receipt
and
placing
of
wagers
are
two
sides
of
the
same
coin.
now,
i
believe
also
that
in
the
first
example
given
in
section
325.41
of
the
regulation
which
says
--
which
excludes
the
bookkeeper
as
a
receiver
of
wagers,
even
though
the
bookkeeper
gets
the
very
same
thing
which
the
--
the
pick-up
man
gets
is
an
inconsistency
which
just
can't
be
explained
and
which,
it
seems
to
me,
indicates
that
the
treasury
regulation
is
a
force
attempt
to
read
into
the
statute
more
than
was
there
and
more
than
what
congress
intended
to
be
there.
and
therefore,
what
we
--
and
the
fact
that
the
statute
was
reenacted
in
the
substantially
the
same
language
throws
little
light
on
this.
although
it
has
sometimes
been
said
that
reenactment
of
a
statute
following
the
promulgation
of
a
regulation
indicates
that
congress
approved
of
the
regulation.
that
has
generally
been
the
case
where
the
regulation
has
been
of
longstanding,
where
it
was
well-known,
where
it
had
been
subject
to
court
interpretation,
and
where
it
was
brought
home
to
congress.
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
reports
which
accompanied
the
1954
revenue
code,
which
reenacted
the
statute,
you'll
see
that
there's
just
this
one
sentence
passing
reference
to
the
gambling
taxes
then
lead
to
the
effect
that
we
have
reenacted
the
gambling
taxes
to
say
that
when
congress
did
that,
it
took
this
treasury
interpretation
and
put
it
into
the
gambling
tax
statutes
goes
entirely
too
far
in
our
opinion.
so
what
we
come
back
to
is
the
statute
which
is
where
we
started.
and
we
submit
that
if
you
stick
with
the
statute
and
avoid
this
rather
easy
way
of
getting
at
it
by
saying,
“oh,
let's
bring
everybody
in
because
congress
was
trying
to
hit
everybody
in
this
lane,
you
stay
with
the
statute,
you
can
only
come
to
the
result
which
the
court
below
bridge.”
and
since
this
is
a
statute
which
is
both
a
taxing
measure
and
a
criminal
measure,
there
is
no
justification
for
taking
this
attitude
of
broadening
it
beyond
its
plain
terms
and
extending
it
to
situations
which
were
not
contemplated
and
which
do
not
fit
in
with
the
statute
taken
as
a
whole.
thank
you,
sir.
