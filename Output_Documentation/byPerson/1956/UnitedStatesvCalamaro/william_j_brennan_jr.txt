how
about
the
payoff
man?
that
is
the
individual
who
distributes
the
winnings
to
the
few
people
who,
i
understand,
sometimes
win
in
this
game?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
who
brings
the
winnings
to
the
writer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
suppose
he
didn't?
suppose
he
had
an
intermediary
like
this
pick-up
man?
is
that
intermediary
who
brought
to
the
bank
the
proceeds,
deliver
to
the
writers,
deliver
to
the
winners
would
--
may
be
subject?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
he
would
on
the
theory
that
anyone
who
participates
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
as
a
chap
is,
i
gathered
in
some
states,
both
the
chap
who
distributed
and
the
chap
who
the
pick-up
man
would
be
a
bookmaker
for
the
purposes
of
bookmaking
statute,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
states.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
by
that
--
the
--
the
very
fact
that
it
was
not
one
of
the
secretary's
means
of
balancing
the
budget
indicates
that
congress
had
a
broader
purpose
on
the
--
just
the
excise
operation.
and
why
wouldn't
it
be
submersed
in
the
proposition
that
they
wanted
everybody
registered
when
they
could
put
their
fingers
on,
connected
with
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
sometimes
congress
doesn't
use
the
precise
language,
perhaps
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
are
you
reading
from?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
realistically
though,
is
it
actually
placed
with
the
banker
until
he
has
it
in
his
hands
for
recording?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i'm
speaking
now
to
this
reference
in
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
that
the
report?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
until
the
banker
gets
it
in
his
hands,
how
is
that
placed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
--
certainly,
it
does
this
much,
doesn't
it?
it
interposes
the
wall,
really,
between
the
writer
and
the
actual
banker?though
as
to
make
more
difficult
the
detection
of
the
banker,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
a
--
is
that
a
convenient
way,
the
fellow
who
stock
--
the
one
with
the
slips
on
him
and
he's
merely
a
pick-up
man,
unless
not
required
to
take
out
this
title,
this
license
on
it,
makes
it
rather
an
easy
way
doesn't
it
to
defeat
the
whole
intention
of
the
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
he
may
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
transaction
disappears,
doesn't
it,
as
soon
as
he
turns
the
slips
over
to
the
pick-up
man?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
know
that
i'm
trying
to
say
anything.
i'm
just
suggesting
if
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
it
makes
it
an
easy
way,
doesn't
it,
to
--
to
do
the
very
thing
that
the
statute
was
aimed
at
accomplishing
which
was
that
make
it
easy
to
find
out
who
it
was
within
this
business.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
--
that's
the
argument,
isn't
it,
for
the
position
that
everybody
connected
would
be
ought
to
be
required
to
register?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
thought
--
i
thought
in
the
legitimate
stock
exchange
business,
a
runner
is
not
what
you
said
a
writer,
isn't
it?
when
he
run
--
the
chapel
runs
around
from
brokerage
house
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
brokerage
house.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he's
a
runner
but
he's
a
pick-up
man
and
that
--
that
runner
have
a
different
connotation
in
this
bank
than
it
does
in
the
stock
exchange?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
you
just
did.
i
thought
you
just
answered
mr.
justice
harlan
that
in
this
game
a
runner
is
a
writer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
would've
suppose
that
senator
kefauver
was
using
runner
in
the
sense
that
they
used
runner
in
the
stock
exchange
game,
which
is
a
pick-up
man.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
--
are
you
citing
those
figures
to
suggest
that
really
the
statute
was
aimed
at
getting
more
revenue?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
didn't
ask
that.
i
didn't
ask
that.
i
ask
whether
--
asking
as
on
the
basis
of
those
figures
to
agree
that
this
was
a
measure
aimed
at
increasing
revenue
in
any
substantial
way?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
do
you
do
with
the
fellow
who
carries
the
winnings
to
the
writers?
they
passed
on
to
the
people
who
were
supposed
to
get
them?
what's
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know.
that
is
he
--
he
receives
the
moneys
that
were
placed
in
bet.
but
the
winnings,
you
suggest
that
would
give
you
difficulty?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
would
suppose
you'll
have
to
if
that's
the
basis
on
which
you
say
we
ought
to
hold
the
pick-up
man.
isn't
basically
the
government's
argument
that
anybody
connected
with
the
operation,
say
those
clerks
and
others
who
are
excluded
by
the
regulations
are
required
to
register?
