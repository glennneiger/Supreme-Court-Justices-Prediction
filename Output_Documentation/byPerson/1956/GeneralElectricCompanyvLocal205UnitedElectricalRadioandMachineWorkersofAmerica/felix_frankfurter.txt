justice
felix
frankfurter
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
--
that
all
those
who
sustained
the
enforceability
of
the
arbitration
provision
have
rested
it
under
the
arbitration
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
they
were
removing
the
diversity
requirement,
what
do
they
leave
in
its
place?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
--
are
you
saying
mr.
farr
that
without
regard
to
diversity
that
congress
consciously
said
here
we
leave
--
we
open
the
door,
if
i
may
use
that
striking
figure
of
speech,
so
that
you
may
then
apply
state
law
and
at
the
same
time
strike
out
diversity?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
fact
that
they
were
opposed
may
not
--
it
doesn't
disprove
their
wisdom
doe
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
doesn't
prove
that
that's
what
--
that's
what
really
the
legislation
does.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
farr,
in
your
--
in
your
investigation
of
the
legislative
history,
did
you
encounter
any
proposal
either
a
statement,
formal
document,
testimony
in
hearing
indicating
that
any
representative
of
labor
wanted
--
proposed
anything
like
this
in
order
to
be
able
to
get
after
employers
when
they
refuses
to
arbitrate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
probably
you've
read
all
the
opinions
of
the
lower
court
dealing
with
them
not
all
of
them.
the
courts
of
appeals
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
assumed
you've
read
all
of
the
courts
of
appeals
on
this,
maybe
not
the
district
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
encountered
any
opinion
which
makes
any
reference
to
--
any
suggestions
secondhand
that
--
that
labor
wanted
to
have
a
strengthened
position
in
enforcing
arbitration
agreement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they're
entitled
to
the
windfall
if
they
have
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
are
always
the
lawyers
to
stimulate
the
client
company.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
the
question
is
still
more
restrictive
as
i
think
to
inquire
justice
brennan
implied
isn't
the
question
with
arbitration
should
be
legally
enforceable?
there's
the
still
further
quality
question
which
certainly
was
right
in
many
aspects
not
incomparable
to
this.
well,
it
should
be
enforced
to
the
federal
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
a
very
different
question
again.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
could
look
up,
but
you
can
tell
me
quickly.
did
judge
magruder
consider
the
gully
case
in
connection
with
the
point
you're
now
making?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
different
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
if
you
forgive
me.
and
i
don't
put
it
that
the
arbitration
act
came
on
--
came
into
law,
came
on
the
statute
books
in
1925.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
1925,
there
was
no
title
28.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
title
28
--
therefore,
the
arbitration
act
is
now
written,
part
of
u.s.c
9,
they
then
restricted
this
--
this
one
--
knows
no
more
than
i
do
which
is
next
to
nothing.
in
order
to
reach
section
4,
it
must
satisfy
a
right
arising
as
you
argue
under
title
28.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
you're
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
there
was
no
301
in
1925.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
that's
title
28,
still
contains
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
we'd
have
jurisdiction
for
some
other
remedy,
damages
or
specific
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
any
remedy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'll
put
it
to
you
that
you're
up
against
the
gully.
i
mean
an
adjudication
on
the
point
you're
making
on
that
analysis
brings
you
right
up
to
the
gully
case
the
mere
fact
that
ultimately
you
may
reach
a
federal
statute
doesn't
mean
the
case
arises
under
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
boston-herald
case
been
reported,
mr.
rosenberg?
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you
very
much.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
making
a
point
that
this
is
not
an
injunction
within
the
scope
of
the
norris-laguardia
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
that's
on
the
substantive
side
that
i
am
making
a
point
as
to
the
particular
kind
of
order,
namely,
that
an
order
for
a
specific
performance
which
limits
--
which
is
an
injunction
not
to
do
something
that
you
want
to
do.
are
you
making
a
point
that
that
is
not
both
an
injunction
if
that
phrase
is
use?
i
don't
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
don't
mean
to
touch
the
major
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
argue
about
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
your
reliance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
saying
the
norris-laguardia
act
doesn't
apply.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
goes
to
the
content,
the
nature
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
controversy
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
not
that
--
that
this
isn't
of
the
nature
of
injunction.
that
a
specific
performance
is
an
indicative
way
of
saying
you
must
do
the
opposite
of
that
which
you're
ordered
to
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
that's
all
i
wanted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
judge
aldrich
went
exclusively
on
norris-laguardia,
didn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
fair
to
say
that
judge
magruder
did
not
rest
on
301?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
you
said
it
couldn't
be
rested
on
301.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand
that.
but
--
but
for
the
purpose
of
--
he
wouldn't
--
he
wouldn't
have
granted
specific
performance
to
arbitrate
on
the
basis
of
301,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
many
are
--
i
suppose,
you've
got
what
he's
written
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it's
clear
he
didn't
rest
on
301
but
said
it
couldn't
be
rested.
you
have
to
go
over
to
arbitration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
as
you
rightly
indicate,
but
he
uses
301
for
jurisdiction
of
purpose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
would
indicate
just
--
from
hearing
what
you
read
would
indicate
that
the
board
would
have
the
kind
of
discretion
to
entertain
what
alleged
unfair
labor
practices
referring
to
on
the
basis
on
which
it
now
selectively
entertains
unfair
labor
practice,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
all
you've
read
said
that
the
board
wouldn't
have
to
entertain
every
case
for
claim
of
underpayment
or
--
but
would
selectively
take
what
cases
would
give
rise
to
a
general
rule.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
another
words,
just
what
it's
doing
now
on
a
larger
scale
of
saying,
we
wouldn't
handle
a
lot
of
the
cases
to
which
reference
are
made
in
chief
justice's
opinion
yesterday.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
what
jurisdiction
of
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
what
is
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
of
the
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
lifting
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
go
to
conference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
--
at
--
it
was
the
conference
that
knocked
it
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
money,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
be
clear,
mr.
rosenberg.
one
of
--
i'm
not
at
all
questioning
the
--
the
scope
that
you
gave
to
this
litigation,
but
one
of
the
cases
involves
backpay,
is
that
right?
do
--
are
both
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
--
yes,
they
may.
but
--
but
is
there
a
difference
in
the
--
in
the
questions
by
which
where
liability
for
backpay
would
be
determined?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
--
is
one
of
these
cases
like
westinghouse
--
i
--
i
mean
in
the
--
with
the
subject
matter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
so
far
as
--
so
far
as
backpay
is
concern,
is
the
question
legally
different
from
the
one
that
was
involved
in
westinghouse
where
there
are
also
have
to
be
a
determination
prior
to
say
whether
there
should
or
shouldn't
be
back
pay,
namely,
where
the
man
off
on
their
own
time,
was
it
clear
at
all
or
wasn't
clear
at
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
but
what
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
say
about
diversity?
i
understood
you
to
say
--
i
heard
you
say,
i
think,
that
the
outset,
that
in
fact,
the
record
present
the
case
of
diversity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
proper
alignment
of
parties
on
the
respective
sides
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
just
said
you
have
diversity.
meaning
by
that
that
in
fact
you
have
diversities?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
i
heard
mr.
farr
say
that
there
was
a
--
you
moved
to
amend
so
as
to
include
diversity
and
for
some
reason,
the
court
of
appeals
denied
that,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
diversity,
then
it
changes
the
whole
nature
of
the
problem
certainly
for
one
member
of
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
it
said
--
according
to
me,
its
beyond
--
and
i
wonder,
it
can
give
you
capacity,
what
does
it
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
wasn't
lateness.
it
wasn't
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
judge
--
i
--
i
thought
there
were
enough
questions
but
this
entered
--
would
bring
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
new
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
all
respect,
i
didn't
understand
what
it
--
may
have
become
moot.
what's
that
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that's
become
moot,
why
isn't
the
rest
of
the
case
moot?
is
it
moot
because
he's
already
granted
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
want
it
on
a
different
ground?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
donahue
against
kenney,
mr.
rosenberg?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
donahue
against
kenny
which
he
cites?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
what
does
it
hold?
justice
felix
frankfurter
within
the
massachusetts
court,
you
can't
do
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
should
--
that
way
you
can't
do
it
in
the
federal
court
although
you've
got
301
which
if
it
does
anything
as
you
say,
it
does
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
--
was
there
opinion
reported?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
the
american
thread
case
didn't
go
up,
did
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
--
but
--
but
in
that
case,
judge
wyzanski
said
the
question
of
--
of
enforcing
arbitration
is
a
matter
of
federal
law
not
state
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
judge
magruder
may
have
been
indifferent
to
what
you
wanted
to
put
before
him
under
diversity
on
the
assumption
that
its
federal
law
is
govern
and
massachusetts
law
is
of
no
help.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you
don't
have
to
bother
about
what
local
massachusetts
law
is,
you
can
be
indifferent
to
the
confusion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
you're
saying
is
that
you've
got
all
federal
law
and
state
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
he
wasn't
confronted
with
the
problem
of
choosing
between
the
two,
isn't
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
chose
but
i
--
but
you
say
that
--
that
you
have
another
string
to
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
your
bow,
namely,
the
state
law
under
diversity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
thought
that
was
moot,
cause
the
moot.
and
in
any
event
--
in
any
event,
he
couldn't
understand
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
implication
is,
of
your
argument,
that
you
have
a
right
here
to
sustain
the
judgment
on
any
ground
that
makes
it
sustainable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
diversity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
one
sense
that
you
must
clear
for
all
those
is
norris-laguardia.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rosenberg,
about
your
own
analysis,
your
own
discussion
showed
that
as
the
--
as
the
legislation
evolved
instead
of
dealing
with
subject
matters
catching
fee
that
are
dealing
with
content
that
dealt
with
categories
of
employee
as
of
--
as
we
now
have
the
statute.
that's
true,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
wages
and
all
the
rest?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
to
color
the
whole
thing,
of
course,
as
the
thing
went
in
the
succession
of
--
of
drafting
and
oppositions
and
so
on,
we
now
have
what
we
have,
not
at
all
any
subject
matter,
the
categories
of
employees.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
just
what
they
didn't
do.
they
didn't
talk
about
wages
and
--
and
all
the
rest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
that's
what
i'm
suggesting.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
you've
just
said
brings
into
play
professor
cox's
and
this
--
on
this
board
not
confusing
article,
that
you
just
called
--
you
just
said
that
the
basis
of
the
reviews
with
the
contract
in
collective
bargaining
contract
are
used
to
phrase
in
section
2,
you
call
them
collective
bargaining
contract
in
order
to
bring
it
into
commerce.
but
in
section
1,
it
isn't
a
contract
in
a
sense
of
contract
of
employment
of
section
1.
that's
true,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
i'm
suggesting
of
professor
cox
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
in
section
1,
you
say,
it
isn't
a
contract
of
employment
but
in
section
2
is
the
same
with
section
2
by
regarding
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
a
collective
bargaining
contract
and
used
the
word
--
i'm
not
saying
it
isn't
allowable.
all
i'm
saying
is
a
little
strange
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
one's
mind
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
it's
not
a
contract
of
employment
on
section
1
but
this
is
a
contract
under
section
2.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
suggesting
that
--
that
that
which
is
not
a
contract
of
employment
in
section
1,
is
utilized
as
a
contract
in
order
to
sustain
it
as
in
commerce.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
maybe
properly
but
all
i'm
saying
is,
it's
a
nice
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
what
it
says?
justice
felix
frankfurter
say,
for
this
agreement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
you
go
to
--
you
find
out
whether
this
agreement
or
whether
the
agreement
arises
under
a
federal
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
under
diversity
action
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
anyone
had
the
jurisdiction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
know
--
that
--
i
was
hoping
we'd
get
through
these
arguments
without
hearing
that
dubious
phrase.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
isn't
--
it
isn't
the
name.
it's
perfectly
good
english
word.
i
don't
understand
what
they
mean
in
this
connection.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
only
if
that's
to
be
argued,
we'd
spend
more
than
three
minutes
on
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
and
you
can
use
it
if
you
thought
that
was
important.
nevertheless,
the
fact
--
the
fact
that
congress
might,
what
i'm
suggesting
is
this,
the
fact
that
constitutionally
congress
might
confer
jurisdiction
upon
federal
court
to
set
its
purposes
doesn't
mean
that
within
the
terms
of
the
statute,
a
case
arises
under
such
a
federal
statute
because
ever
since
gully,
which
is
from
my
point
of
view,
a
landmark
case,
we
know
that
you
can't
go
back
ultimately
that
the
immediate
issue
must
be
one
that
arises
under
the
statute
and
not
waived
to
the
far
reaches.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
a
very
different
thing,
mr.
rosenberg.
if
you
got
--
if
you
can
rest
on
the
arbitration
act
and
you
--
if
you
rest
on
the
arbitration
act,
you
still
must
have
--
you
can't
lift
itself
by
it,
you
can't
lift
--
you
can't
lift
itself
by
its
own
terms
because
section
4
has
a
qualification.
it
doesn't
say
anything
that
it
saw
fit
simply
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
back
to
congress
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
can
be
enforced.
it
said
that
it
--
you
must
have
an
agreement
which
under
some
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
got
a
--
but
section
4
is
the
thing
you've
drawn
in
order
to
know
what
the
court
should
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
congress
--
if
you
had
no
section
4,
maybe
the
courts
could
have
fashion
their
own
procedural
remedies.
but
congress
hasn't
left
with
that
thing.
it
has
made
specific
provision
by
section
4.
you
can't
disregard
it
and
go
merely
to
the
subsequent
provision
of
2.
this
is
very
tricky,
an
intricate
business
and
--
and
we're
dealing
with
a
very
--
a
very
specialized
strictly
defined
jurisdiction
out
of
the
federal
courts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
that
in
what
section?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then
you
have
to
read
it
at
4.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
tells
how
a
court
can
give
you
the
relief
you
want.
and
when
congress
tells
you
how
you
can
get
the
relief,
you
must
obey
what
congress
--
courts
must
obey
how
they
should
carry
out
their
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
