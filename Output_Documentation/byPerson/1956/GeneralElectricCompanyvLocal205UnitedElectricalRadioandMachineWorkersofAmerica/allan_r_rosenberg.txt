mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
i
very
much
doubt
that
the
court
has
an
adequate
idea
of
what
the
issues
are
in
this
case
or
what
the
--
particularly
with
respect
to
the
factual
nature
of
the
problem
involved
here
or
what
the
issues
are
likely
to
be
in
the
typical
case
involving
an
arbitration
clause
and
the
collective
bargaining
contract
that
contains
a
no-strike
clause
from
the
presentation
of
my
brother
farr.
as
i
heard
him,
it
was
a
little
case
involving
mr.
boiardi
who
wasn't
getting
paid
and
mr.
armstrong
who
was
improperly
discharged
so
he
claimed.
and
these
are
things
which
really
no
one
is
being
heard
on
and
it's
better
to
leave
it
to
general
electric
to
decide
whether
or
not
this
is
arbitrable
or
not.
and
perhaps,
the
employees
ought
to
be
able
to
sue
and
without
regard
to
the
union
and
bypassing
the
union
and
go
to
some
court
where
the
state
of
federal
depending
on
what's
involved.
and
--
and
of
course,
if
the
union
--
if
the
employer
refuses
to
arbitrate
why
the
union
has
relief
of
its
no-strike
clause
and
that's
all
fine.
now,
i
submit
that
without
an
understanding
of
what
is
involved
in
this
case
and
in
other
cases
involving
the
kind
of
grievance
to
get
something
on
the
issue
of
arbitration
and
goes
to
court,
one
will
not
appreciate
the
problem
involved
here
without
regard
to
the
legal
issues
involved.
here,
we
start
with
a
contract.
first,
let
me
say
that
we
have
a
local
union,
a
local
massachusetts
union
representing
the
employees
of
the
general
electric
company
of
ashland,
massachusetts.
the
general
electric
company
causes
a
new
york
corporation
in
an
industry
affecting
commerce.
the
record
has
an
uncontroverted
affidavit
that
all
the
employees
represented
by
or
members
of
this
local
massachusetts
union
are
citizens
of
states
other
than
new
york
and
it
gets
massachusetts,
rhode
island
and
connecticut.
and
the
--
the
factual
basis
of
the
case
as
far
as
that
is
concerned
is
that
the
parties
are
diverse.
the
contract
was
made
in
june
of
1953
and
it
has
been
automatically
renewed
through
august
1956
and
is
replaced
in
august
1956
by
a
five-year
contract
with
this
local
union.
so
we
have
a
situation
different
from
that
in
the
lincoln
mills
case
where
there
was
a
termination
of
the
contract.
here,
there's
been
a
continuous
contract
containing
the
same
terms.
now,
the
terms
of
this
contract
with
respect
to
the
grievance
procedure
are
the
conventional
four-step
grievance
procedure
going
through
progressively
higher
levels
from
the
lowest
level
of
foremen
to
the
plant
manager.
and
if
there
is
a
dispute
which
is
not
settled
in
the
grievance
procedure,
it
goes
to
arbitration.
the
only
parties
to
the
arbitration
are
the
union
and
the
company.
the
employees
are
excluded
from
its
terms.
the
union
selects
the
arbitrator
with
the
company,
the
cost
of
the
arbitration,
the
entire
administration
of
the
arbitration
agreement
is
in
the
hands
of
the
union
and
the
company.
employees
have
no
rights
in
that
as
such,
not
directly.
now,
there
is
a
grievance
--
a
--
a
no-strike
provision
in
this
contract
and
that
is
related
to
the
grievance
procedure
and
it
permit
strikes
when
grievances
which
have
been
processed
and
arbitration
has
not
been
resorted
to,
either
party
being
able
to
resort
to
arbitration
under
the
arbitration
clause.
and
there
are
further
limitations
about
60
days
notice.
now,
there
is
the
provision
involved
in
the
boiardi
grievance
is
set
forth
in
article
ix
and
its
first
paragraph
--
first
numbered
paragraph,
"the
company
shall
furnish
the
union
within
30
days
after
the
signing
of
this
agreement
a
complete
list
of
job
classifications
and
rate
ranges."
and
the
grievance
here
is
that
boiardi
is
classifying
at
a
job
classification,
repairman
3501,
and
he's
not
getting
the
rate
for
it.
what
is
the
significance
of
that
in
this
company?
it
is
that
the
rates
that
have
been
agreed
upon,
the
whole
rate
structure
of
this
company,
is
imperiled
by
what
the
union
asserts
to
be
a
rate
that's
not
--
that
is
being
put
into
effect,
that
hasn't
been
bargained,
that
hasn't
been
furnished
by
the
company.
this
does
not
--
this
is
not
approved
wages.
it
may
result
in
six
cents
an
hour,
i
think,
the
difference
for
this
one
individual
employee.
but
if
the
company,
as
it
might
turn
out,
for
example,
in
arbitration,
is
able
to
put
an
'l'
after
a
rate,
meaning
learner,
and
pay
six
cents
an
hour
or
less
for
one
rate.
there's
no
reason
in
the
world
i
suppose
that
it
can't
do
it
after
other
rates.
so
you
have
the
whole
rate
structure
of
the
general
electric
plant
of
ashland
involved.
this
question
involves
whether
or
not
the
company
has
furnished
a
complete
list
of
job
descriptions
and
rate
ranges
to
the
union
within
30
days
after
the
signing
of
this
contract
in
june
of
1953.
that's
what's
involved
here.
what
is
involved
is
what
not
only
boiardi
but
every
employee
who
has
a
job
classification
and
a
rate
range
is
getting
what
the
union
and
the
company
bargained
to
give
him.
that's
the
problem
here.
now,
they're
saying,
no
one
is
hurt.
they
say,
let
the
employee
sue.
let
the
company
decide
whether
it's
arbitrable
or
not
is
to
negate
the
purpose
for
which
the
collective
bargain
was
made,
should
they
strike
or
should
they
go
to
arbitration.
they've
chosen,
as
they
have
a
right
to
do,
to
go
to
arbitration
on
it.
now,
the
company
could
very
well
say,
this
is
not
arbitrable
and
tested
out
as
it
did
in
the
boston
herald-traveler
case.
but
it
takes
the
flat
position,
not
that
this
isn't
arbitrable,
but
there
is
no
relief
to
be
had
in
the
federal
courts
in
this
contract
of
a
manufacturing
company
with
production
and
maintenance
employees
involved
in
a
rate
structure
case
which
cuts
across
the
whole
of
its
--
of
plant
in
--
in
ashland.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
i
believe
it
has,
your
honor.
i
don't
have
the
reference.
it
was
a
companion
case
on
the
enforceability
aspect
of
it
to
the
general
electric
and
the
goodall-sanford
cases.
but
it
went
down
to
the
district
court
and
then
came
up
again
on
arbitrability.
we
are
--
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
what's
that?
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
mr.
farr
informs
me
it's
in
the
same
volume
as
this
case.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
now,
the
boiardi
case
--
i'm
sorry,
the
armstrong
case
arises
out
of
a
different
section
of
the
contract.
that
section
of
the
contract
has
to
do
with
the
grievance
procedure
itself
and
it
concerns
--
it's
in
article
12.
and
there
is
a
clause
concerning
a
grievance
--
concerning
dismissal
for
cause.
now,
i
cannot
make
the
same
argument
about
a
dismissal
for
cause
that
i
make
about
the
rate
structure
in
this
plant,
but
i
do
make
this
that
the
--
in
the
first
place,
it's
apparent
that
the
underlying
grievance
that
is
beyond
the
--
the
case
on
arbitration.
the
--
the
arbitration
clause
unquestionably
runs
to
the
union,
qua
union,
so
that
we
have
here,
as
i
suggest,
a
case
appropriate
for
301
jurisdiction
whether
it
is
a
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter
or
jurisdiction
to
grant
the
particular
kind
of
relief
to
one
side.
we
--
we
have
jurisdiction
qua
over
a
union
controversy
here.
and
the
underlying
grievance
in
the
boiardi
case
concerns
a
promise
that
the
company
will
turn
over
to
the
union
not
to
mr.
boiardi
or
to
any
of
the
700
or
800
employees
in
this
plant
but
it's
a
promise
that
runs
to
the
union.
that's
the
underlying
grievance
and
then
beyond
that,
there
is
mr.
boiardi's
right
and
the
union's
right
to
test
whether
that
promise
by
the
company
to
the
union
has
been
fulfilled.
in
the
armstrong
case,
we
have
a
situation
that's
not
the
same.
we
have
a
man
who
is
discharged
and
the
only
aspect
of
it
that
i
would
think
the
union
has
a
direct
interest
in
is
the
aspect
that
it
hasn't
all
discharged
for
cause
cases
where
the
union's
interest
in
--
in
the
law
of
the
bargain,
in
the
law
of
the
collective
bargaining
contract
were
the
company
says,
we
shall
not
discharge
except
for
cause
or
in
this
case,
a
more
elliptical
form
of
it,
is
observed
for
the
protection
of
the
individual
members.
in
that,
the
union
has
a
stake,
as
i
think
it
was
pointed
out
in
the
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
opinion
in
the
--
in
the
westinghouse
case.
these
cases
often
triggered
strikes
and
disputes
which
lead
to
strikes.
so
certainly
with
respect
to
the
underlying
premise
in
the
--
in
the
rate
structure
case
and
the
boiardi
case,
we
have
a
--
a
situation
which
is
kind
of
doubled
bottom.
we
have,
first,
the
premise
running
to
the
union
to
arbitrate
and
this
involves
a
premise
running
to
the
union
to
turn
over
a
complete
list
of
right
ranges
and
job
descriptions.
now,
it
is
a
fact,
as
mr.
farr
has
pointed
out,
that
this
case
was
dismissed
by
the
--
a
motion
to
strike
the
equitable
relief
and
finally,
a
final
judgment
had
been
granted
by
the
district
court
of
massachusetts
in
this
case
on
the
sole
ground
that
the
plain
language
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
forbids
the
issuance
of
the
injunction
as
the
court
called
it
sought
in
this
case,
what
we
sought
in
the
complaint
which
was
filed
in
december
1954
prior
to
westinghouse.
and
while
the
american
thread
was
the
single
case
in
massachusetts
in
the
federal
district
court
there
on
that
subject.
what
we
sought
was
a
decree
of
specific
performance
of
this
arbitration
clause.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
your
honor,
i
say
it
is
not
the
kind
of
order
or
decree
or
injunction
or
mandatory
relief
requested
which
the
norris-laguardia
act
is
aimed
at.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
well,
i
think
--
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
i
understand.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
i
think
that
--
that
there
is
--
there's
law
of
both
ways
on
that
and
i
would
hesitate
to
--
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
--
to
try
to
fix
a
label
on
something
--
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
--
and
determine
its
substance.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
no.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
no.
i
think
the
norris-laguardia
act
applies
to
--
as
--
as
judge
--
chief
judge
magruder
said
to
labor
injunction
--
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
--
on
a
typical
sense.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
that's
right.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
that's
right.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
i
place
no
reliance,
your
honor.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
i
do
say
as
the
george
amendment
which
i've
outlined
in
the
brief
points
out
that
there
is
some
reason
for
thinking
that
the
--
and
as
this
court
in
the
virginia
railway
case
adverted
to
the
--
to
the
mandatory
nature
of
the
mandatory
injunctions
or
mandatory
orders
where
--
as
i
see
it
bypassed
or
left
out
of
those
legislative
history
to
indicate
that
they
were
not
to
be
included
in
the
prohibitions
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
but
i
think
basically,
as
chief
judge
magruder
says,
this
isn't
the
kind
of
thing
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
was
aimed
at.
now,
the
court
of
appeals,
having
before
just
the
dismissal
on
the
ground
of
the
bar
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
did
have
arguments
presented
on
state
law,
on
the
united
states
arbitration
act
on
section
301.
and
--
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
so
i
understand
it
and
so
the
court
of
appeals
did.
he
said
and
i'm
quoting
him,
"the
plain
language
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
forbids
the
issuance
of
the
injunction."
now,
i
do
not
think
that
judge
magruder's
position
has
been
accurately
represented
with
respect
to
section
301.
as
i
read
it,
while
he
says
that
it
was
not
intended
either
to
create
any
new
remedies
or
to
deny
applicable
existing
remedies,
he
does
say
that
if
you
read
the
maximum
into
it
that
can
be
read
into
him,
the
most
that
could
be
read
into
it
would
be
that
it
authorizes
equitable
remedies
in
general
including
decrees
for
specific
performance
of
an
arbitration
agreement.
that's
on
page
73
of
the
record.
he
finds
on
the
basis
of
the
legislative
history
which
i
will
try
to
trace
briefly
for
your
honors
that
--
that's
the
most
that
can
be
read
into
it.
and
i
say
as
judge
wyzanski
said,
this
is
a
statute
in
which,
under
title
2,
the
declaration
of
policy
and
otherwise
the
maximum
degree
of
enforcement
of
arbitration
clauses
should
be
read
into
it.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
no,
i
don't
--
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
well,
he
did
rest
on
it
as
a
jurisdictional
basis.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
i
think
that's
--
that's
probably
correct.
he
says
it
lacks
the
procedural
safeguards
and
it's
impractical
to
use
it.
i
gather
that
if
pressed,
he
would
say,
maybe
you
can
read
into
it
if
you
read
it
at
its
maximum.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
yes.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
right.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
that's
right.
and
i
don't
think,
if
your
honor
please,
that
there
is
any
serious
question
or
should
be
even
under
westinghouse
that
this
is
a
union
controversy
on
which
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
over
the
subject
matter
clearly
attaches.
it
is
--
it
seems
to
me
to
scale
the
importance
of
the
problem
down
to
talk
about
while
these
little
arbitration
things
and
if
the
company
wants
to
agree
or
it
doesn't
want
to
agree.
this
is
and
has
become
a
policy
of
the
united
states,
title
2
of
the
--
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
it
says
it
is
a
policy
of
the
united
states
that
such
arbitration
clauses
should
be
included
in
collective
bargaining
contracts.
and
i
think
that
the
approach
of
both
the
senate
and
the
house
in
their
separate
versions
of
this
legislation
toward
accomplishing
some
remedy
for
the
violations
of
contracts
and
refusal
to
honor
arbitration
agreements
makes
it,
to
me,
sufficiently
clear.
and
by
sufficiently,
i
mean,
sufficiently
to
persuade
mr.
chief
judge
magruder
to
make
the
statement
that
he
made
and
to
persuade
this
court
and
i
think
the
court's
reluctance
--
the
lower
court's
reluctance
to
use
it
and
to
go
to
the
arbitration
act
is
misguided.
i
think
that
there
is
enough
in
the
legislative
history.
and
i
--
let
--
let
me
call
without
repeating
what
the
statutory
recognition
of
these
contracts
is
valid,
binding
and
enforceable
and
the
effort
of
the
senate
to
go
tandem
with
301
and
sections
8
(a)
(6)
and
8
(b)
(5).
without
repeating
what
your
honors
have
already
heard
on
that,
there
was
a
question
raised
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
“could
you
dispense
with
going
to
the
board
under
the
senate
version
without
--
before
you
go
to
court?”
now,
the
senate
considered
that.
the
senate
report
made
a
point
on
that.
it
made
the
point
--
it
is
the
purpose
of
this
bill
to
encourage
collective
bargaining
and
somewhat.
it
would
not
be
conducive
to
that
object
if
the
board
became
the
form
for
trying
day-to-day
grievances
or
from
the
guide
of
unfair
labor
practice
cases.
it
entertained
damage
actions
arising
under
breach
of
contract.
hence,
the
committee
anticipates
that
the
board
will
develop
by
rules
and
regulations
a
policy
of
entertaining
under
these
provisions
and
those
provisions
with
the
unfair
labor
practice
provisions,
if
your
honor
will
recall
which
would
eventuate
in
a
cease
and
desist
and
affirmative
order
requiring
compliance
with
the
terms
that
the
particular
case
warranted.
the
board
will
develop
by
rules
and
regulations
a
policy
of
entertaining
under
these
provisions
only
such
cases
alleging
violation
of
contract
as
cannot
be
settled
by
resort
to
the
machinery
established
by
the
contract
itself,
voluntary
arbitration
or
if
necessary
by
litigation
in
court.
and
it
talks
about
any
other
cause
would
engulf
the
board
with
a
vast
number
of
petty
cases
and
so
on.
in
short,
the
intention
of
the
committee
in
this
regard
is
of
cases
of
contract,
violation
to
be
entertained
on
a
highly
selected
basis
when
it
is
demonstrated
in
the
board
that
alternative
methods
of
settling
the
dispute
have
been
exhausted
or
are
not
available.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
well,
i
think
--
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
well,
i
think
if
you
refer
to
jurisdictional
features,
that
maybe
so
but
i
gather
that
this
means
--
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
well,
i
mean
the
--
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
--
quantitative
--
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
the
quantitative
aspect
of
it,
more
than
100,000,
more
than
50,000,
the
company
and
the
commerce
aspect
involved.
but
i
think
they
refer
to
the
importance
of
it,
the
important
of
--
the
importance
of
the
particular
subject
matter
rather
than
the
affect
upon
commerce,
the
nature
of
the
--
of
the
industry.
now,
it's
--
it's
sufficiently
evident,
i
say,
that
in
the
senate
bill,
the
301
and
the
unfair
labor
practice
sections
were
to
be
driven
in
tandem
that
you
would
get
alternative
or
correlative
relief
out
of
either
one.
and
since
it's
clear
that
you
could
get
specific
performance
by
way
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
and
the
senate
committee
makes
it
quite
clearly
that
you
could
get
alternative
or
similar
relief
out
of
301.
there
is
a
--
an
intention
and
authority
in
congress
in
that
version
of
the
senate
bill
to
get
out
of
301,
what
was
in
8
(a)
(6)
and
8
(b)
(5).
now,
you
have
the
same
thing
in
the
house
bill.
the
house
bill
approach
is
a
little
bit
differently.
it
had
a
provision
under
definitions
of
what
collective
bargaining
means
in
section
211
(a),
that
you
had
to
--
that
there
was
a
procedure
for
settling
grievances,
you
had
to
follow
it.
and
then,
they
made
in
8
(a)
(5)
and
8
(b)
(2)
an
unfair
labor
practice
to
refuse
to
bargain
collectively
to
follow
the
grievance
procedure.
and
in
section
302
which
was
the
house
version
of
section
301,
they
--
in
--
in
one
subsection
of
it,
they
made
the
norris-laguardia
act
inapplicable.
now,
it's
evident
from
this
that
the
house
at
least
envisions
full
equitable
relief
out
of
its
version
of
section
302,
otherwise,
they
wouldn't
have
made
the
norris-laguardia
act
and
i
quote,
"to
the
extent
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
stood
in
the
way
of
granting
that
kind
of
equitable
relief,
they
remove
it."
now,
when
it
got
to
the
--
to
conference
and
--
and
the
minority
report
in
the
senate
as
my
brother
farr
has
mentioned
and
the
remarks
of
senator
morris
on
his
disappointment
about
their
excluding
the
alternative
unfair
labor
practice
method.
he
makes
it
quite
clear.
he
was
in
favor
of
it.
he
was
not
an
opponent
of
it.
he
make
it
clear,
it
seemed
to
me
or
sufficiently
clear
that
when
the
conference
report
eliminated
the
unfair
labor
practice
group,
it
left
in
what
the
senate
said
should
be
handled
through
301
and
what
the
house
in
its
version
decided
should
be
handled
through
its
section
302.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
yes,
it
did.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
the
conference
had
knocked
it
out.
now,
the
significance
of
that,
if
your
honor
please,
is
that
the
relief
that
maybe
granted,
assuming
i'm
correct
about
that
equitable
relief
maybe
granted
under
section
301.
the
relief
that
maybe
granted
under
section
301
so
construed
is
not
a
coextensive
with
the
prohibitions
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
the
norris-laguardia
act
doesn't
prohibit
everything
that
could
be
granted
under
section
301.
it's
evident
in
this
case.
it's
evident
i
say
in
the
steele
and
tunstall
type
of
cases.
it's
evident
in
the
--
in
the
case
from
the
third
circuit
involving
the
s.o.--
standard
oil
of
california
of
--
the
s.o.,
standard
oil
case
where
the
--
despite
the
norris-laguardia
act,
referred
for
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
third
circuit
issued
an
order
directing
the
company
to
negotiate
on
a
new
wage
rate.
now,
it
--
i
--
i
say
that
the
--
the
a
court
could
prohibit
racial
discrimination
without
violating,
without
running
up
against
the
interdictions
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
under
section
301.
all
i'm
doing
by
way
of
illustration,
if
your
honors
please,
is
to
show
that
if
you
construe
section
301
in
the
light
of
its
legislative
history,
in
the
light
of
its
attempt
to
make
a
binding
enforceable
agreement,
in
the
light
of
the
transfer
of
the
specific
performance
aspects
from
the
unfair
labor
practice
sections
of
the
act
which
were
omitted
and
in
the
placing
of
those
sections
in
the
section
301,
both
in
the
house
and
the
senate
version
and
the
conference
version,
then
it
seems
to
me
you
get
the
result
that
section
301,
in
the
light
of
this
legislative
history
in
its
own
terms,
authorizes
the
kind
of
equitable
relief
which
chief
judge
magruder
talked
about
including
the
degree
for
specific
performance
of
an
arbitration
agreement
except
whether
norris-laguardia
act
apply.
that
is
to
saying,
if
the
attempt
is
made
to
enforce
a
no-strike
clause
in
a
--
under
section
301
by
way
of
injunction,
the
norris-laguardia
act
would
prevent
it.
and
in
the
case
in
the
first
circuit
involving
an
attempt
to
prevent
benefit
payments,
it
would
run
up
against
the
provisions
--
the
specific
provisions
of
section
4,
that's
copra
against
suro
decided
in
1956
in
the
first
circuit.
but
there
are
provisions
--
there
is
relief
that
maybe
granted,
as
i
construe
section
301
in
the
light
of
its
legislative
history,
which
do
not
encounter
the
prohibitions
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
and
one
of
those
is
the
decree
for
specific
performance
of
an
arbitration
agreement.
now,
perhaps
it
is
useful
to
point
out
some
of
the
differences
between
this
case
and
the
preceding
cases.
as
i've
already
indicated,
the
contract
in
this
case
unlike
the
contracts
in
the
other
cases
is
still
in
existence,
it
has
never
terminated
or
at
least
it
was
an
existence
until
august
1956
and
then
it
was
--
by
agreement
of
the
parties,
replaced
by
a
five-year
contract
containing
the
same
terms
and
now
in
existence.
unlike
the
other
two
cases,
general
electric
is
still
in
the
business
in
ashland.
there
is
no
termination
of
employment.
these
grievances,
vary
somewhat
different
relationship.
i'm
not
sure
how
--
how
different
in
--
in
--
if
it
were
not
for
the
fact
that
employment
had
--
has
ceased
or
terminated
in
the
other
cases,
but
these
are
rate
classifications
and
a
discharge.
they
differ
from
the
fringe
benefits
which
are
apparently
once
for
all
involved
in
the
goodall-sanford
case
upon
termination.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
that's
right.
the
discharged
case
involves
reinstatement
as
well
as
--
as
backpay
if
any
--
and
there
maybe
no
backpay.
in
this
case,
this
is
a
particularly
suitable
case
perhaps
for
arbitration
because
the
union
said
in
its
grievance,
the
penalty
of
discharge
is
too
severe
indicating
that
they
may
have
been
a
law
legal
right
to
discharge
the
man
because
he
did
not
do
what
he
was
told
to
do.
but
that
in
the
exercise
of
the
kind
of
discretion
which
arbitrators
have
in
this
field,
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
labor
relations
if
they
are
--
if
it
went
to
arbitration
you
could
get
that
result.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
now,
they
both
may
have
involved
backpay.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
oh,
yes.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
it
may
be.
if
the
arbitrator,
for
example
were
to
say
that
armstrong
has
accrued
wages
owing
to
him,
as
a
result
of
his
unlawful
discharge,
i
supposed
it
would
be
like
westinghouse.
but
if
the
arbitrator's
say,
“well,
the
penalty
of
discharge
was
too
severe
but
he's
already
been
out
a
year
and
half
and
we'll
cut
off
his
wages,
he
won't
get
any
accrued
backpay
and
we'll
put
him
back
to
work.”
then
it's
a
prospective
operation.
it
does
not
necessarily
involve
accrued
wages.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
well,
i
think
there
is
--
the
difference
in
the
aspect
of
the
remedy
in
the
prospective
aspect
of
reinstatement.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
but
apart
from
that,
i
think
there
is
no
legal
difference.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
i
think
there
is
a
--
a
difference
in
the
boiardi
case
because
while
it's
true
that
in
a
sense
backpay
is
involved,
there
are
much
--
much
more
involved
and
it's
a
continuing
and
much
broader
aspect
of
the
case.
now
--
well,
of
course,
we
don't
have
in
this
case
the
appealability
of
the
--
of
the
order
that
we
do
in
the
goodall-sanford
case
and
we
have
in
this
case
state
law,
which
my
brother
farr
did
not
advert
to
it
at
all,
and
we
have
allegations
with
respect
to
diversity
jurisdiction.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
well
--
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
that
is
correct.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
that's
right.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
that's
right.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
well,
your
honor,
i
think
we
have
--
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
well,
i
can
explain
that
a
little
more
accurately
i
think
or
fully
by
saying
that
--
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
well,
i
think
that
--
that
there
is
diversity.
there
is
an
affidavit
in
the
court
of
appeals
where
i
moved
to
amend
to
show
jurisdiction
under
28.1653.
i
think
that's
the
section
number,
in
which
it's
alleged
and
not
controverted
that
all
the
members
of
this
union
and
all
persons
represented
by
it
are
citizens
of
connecticut,
rhode
island
and
massachusetts,
none
of
new
york
and
with
the
corporation
that
is
alleged
to
be
a
new
york
corporation.
it's
alleged
in
the
complaint
that
the
matter
in
controversy
exceeds
$3000.
it's
alleged
irreparable
damage
and
similar
equitable
allegations.
now,
the
--
the
problem,
as
far
as
diversity
is
concern,
as
far
as
the
court
of
appeals
is
concern,
is
that
under
massachusetts
law,
a
union
may
not
sue
in
its
own
name
and
this
suit
was
brought
in
the
name
of
local
205
u.e.
now,
it
said
in
its
opinion,
the
court
of
appeals
did,
that
we
amended
to
show
diversity.
but
this
has
become
moot
and
in
any
event,
it
cannot
be
granted
because
of
the
capacity
because
the
rule
of
state
law
with
respect
to
the
capacity
of
the
union
to
sue
in
its
own
name.
now
--
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
i
should
think
it
does
nothing
if
doesn't
give
you
that.
so,
the
--
the
reason
for
dismissal
is
--
is
capacity
or
the
fact
that
by
having
decided
that
the
federal
question
is
involved
rather
than
a
--
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
no
--
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
no.
i'll
read
you
--
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
all
right,
sir.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
well,
let
me
read
you
exactly
what
it
said
--
what
the
court
said,
“the
plaintiff
has
submitted
a
motion
to
this
court
under
28
u.s.c.1653,
this
is
on
page
82
of
the
record,
"to
amend
its
complaint
so
as
to
allege
diversity
of
citizenship
between
all
the
members
of
the
union
and
defendant.
no
doubt
was
hedged
against
the
ruling
that
relief
could
not
be
granted
under
the
law
of
applicable
to
a
federal
question
case."
in
view
of
our
decision,
this
motion
may
have
become
moot
but
it
must,
in
any
event,
be
denied
for
it
cannot
accomplish
the
result
intended
rule
17
(b),
donahue
against
kenney
in
the
light.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
well,
it
--
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
i
believe
so.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
yes,
sir,
yes,
sir.
but
i
say
that
it's
quite
clear
from
the
cases
and
from
the
statute
itself
that
301
(b)
which
is
involved
in
this
is
a
--
is
a
capacity
statute
and
applicable
generally.
and
that
we
are
entitled
to
sue
in
the
federal
court
even
if
state
law
and
diversity
is
involved
even
where
state
law
would
not
permit
us
to
sue
in
--
in
the
name
of
the
union.
and
i
think
that
diversity
--
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
what's
that?
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
that's
a
--
a
massachusetts
case.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
it
holds
as
i
think
--
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
that's
right.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
that's
right.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
so,
i
think
that
if
we
turn
to
--
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
we
--
we
have
an
adequate
pleading
basis
at
any
rate
for
diversity.
and
we
have
a
favorable
state
law
in
massachusetts.
at
the
time,
the
court
of
appeals
decided
this
case.
there
were
--
there
was
a
statute
on
the
books,
chapter
150,
section
11,
which
made
all
provisions
relating
to
arbitration
in
collective
bargaining
contracts
valid
and
went
on
to
say
that
if
the
parties
agreed
that
the
determination
should
be
final,
then
the
determination
could
be
enforced
by
appropriate
or
proper
judicial
proceedings.
now,
there
were
two
cases
on
the
books
construing
that
and
the
language
of
the
--
of
the
decisions
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
make
it
clear
and
they
quote
in
the
brief
that
they
were
giving
it
a
very
liberal
construction.
they
granted
specific
performance
of
a
check-off
agreement
and
they
granted
a
--
a
wage
assignment
agreement
also.
but
right
after
the
supreme
judicial
court
decided
the
--
or
right
after
the
court
of
appeals
decided
this
case,
the
supreme
judicial
court
came
out
with
two
opinions,
rather
one
and
then
only
recently
another.
in
the
--
in
the
first
of
those
opinions,
post
publishing
company
against
court
involving
the
boston
post,
the
employer
had
discharged
some
large
number
of
employees
of
the
newspaper
and
had
refused
to
arbitrate
them
for
reasons
which
not
apparent
in
the
opinion.
the
american
arbitration
association
and
the
union,
nevertheless,
after
notice
went
ahead
and
it
began
arbitration
of
these
cases
and
the
employer
brought
suit
in
the
massachusetts
courts
to
enjoin
the
arbitration.
the
court
went
up
to
the
supreme
judicial
court
and
the
court
refused
to
enjoined
that
arbitration
and
it
permitted
it
to
proceed
even
though
there
are
allegations
of
preemption
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
said
in
language
again
literally
construing
the
statute
that
all
collective
--
all
provisions
of
collective
bargaining
contract
shall
be
valid
that
the
purpose
of
it
was
to
promote
industrial
peace
and
that
arbitration
should
be
allowed
to
sweep
away
the
items
which
are
not
preempted,
so
that
you
can
finally
get
down
to
what
decisions
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
yes,
your
honor.
it's
in
140,
northeast
2nd
at
185.
now,
the
second
case
involved
a
case
which
was
here
of
--
aspect
of
a
case
which
was
here
on
certiorari,
it's
leonard
against
the
eastern
massachusetts
railway
company.
and
in
that
case,
which
was
decided
in
january,
i
think
it
was
january
21st
of
this
year,
the
--
the
court
issued
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
union
upon
compliance
with
certain
provisions
of
its
contract
was
entitled
to
go
ahead
to
arbitration
and
that
the
--
over
the
opposition
of
the
employer.
so
it
--
it
made
quite
clear
in
--
in
its
decision
that
it
haven't
reached
the
question
as
to
whether
it
would
order
arbitration
because
there
was
a
preliminary
question
of
compliance
by
the
union
with
provisions
of
its
contract.
but
it
made
equally
clear
that
upon
such
compliance
by
the
union,
the
union
was
entitled
by
way
of
its
issuance
of
a
declaratory
judgment
that
entitled
to
have
these
disputes
arbitrated
in
accordance
with
the
arbitration
provisions
of
the
contract.
now,
i
say
that
where
the
statute
is
such
that
it
makes
the
arbitration
provisions
valid,
where
the
court
will
--
over
the
objection
of
the
employer
refused
to
enjoin
an
arbitration
that's
going
ahead
on
this
type
of
collective
or
grievance
arbitration
and
where
the
court
will
issue
a
declaratory
judgment
if
the
union
is
entitled
to
arbitration
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
i
think
that
massachusetts
court
have
shown
a
sufficient
hospitality
to
the
idea
of
specific
performance
in
--
under
massachusetts
law
and
a
sufficient
deference,
as
they
say
in
their
decisions,
to
federal
policy
on
this
court,
both
with
respective
preemption
and
the
respect
to
arbitration
as
a
favored
federal
policy
in
this
--
in
--
in
achieving
industrial
peace.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
it
did
not.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
that's
right.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
well,
until
--
perhaps,
professor
cox
compounded
the
confusion
by
an
article
that
he
wrote
in
which
he
said,
it's
difficult
to
know
what
the
state
of
enforcement
is
in
massachusetts
because
there
are
problems
under
the
statute.
the
statute
--
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
well,
i
--
i'm
sure
that's
true.
at
any
rate,
we
have
here
both
a
--
a
--
it
seems
to
me
a
sufficient
basis
for
the
--
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
that
is
right.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
well,
he
chose
--
he
chose
federal
law.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
that
is
right.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
that
is
right.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
and
now
--
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
that
is
--
that
is
my
position,
your
honor.
i
think
i
have
a
right
and
i
speak
in
terms
of
the
statutory
authority
of
what
i
find
in
section
301
has
illumined
by
this
aspect
of
its
legislative
history,
perhaps,
the
kind
of
ground
on
which
judge
brown
and
his
dissent
in
the
lincoln
mills
case
employed
and,
of
course,
the
arbitration
act.
now,
i
would
like
--
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
and
--
and
diversity
as
a
support
--
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
that
is
right.
norris-laguardia
defies
the
court
of
jurisdiction
to
do
anything
that's
why
the
district
court
didn't
get
to
decide
whether
diversity
or
otherwise.
now,
on
the
arbitration
act,
but
let
me
turn
first
to
the
exclusionary
language
in
section
1,
the
exclusion
of
contracts
and
employment
of
railroad
--
of
--
of
seamen,
railway
men
and
other
workers
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce.
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
that
the
objection
was
made
for
the
bill
when
it
was
presented
in
the
64th
congress
by
furuseth
of
the
international
seamen's
union.
now,
it
is
said
that
the
bill
was
solely
commercial
arbitration.
well,
it
may
have
been
so
but
they
had
a
slipper
in
it.
they
covered
seamen's
wagers,
in
any
other
matter
which
if
the
subject
of
controversy
would
be
cognizable
in
admiralty.
so,
when
the
question
of
seamen's
wages
under
a
compulsory
arbitration
statute
as
furuseth
viewed
it,
it
came
to
the
attention
of
furuseth,
he
engaged
in
long
analysis
which
is
printed
in
the
proceedings
of
the
conventions
of
the
international
seamen's
union.
the
union
adopted
a
resolution
on
compulsory
labor
which
has
been
referred
to
and
there
was
a
discussion
about
it.
now,
the
--
the
--
there's
no
question
that
the
--
the
purpose,
the
--
the
motive
of
the
seamen's
union
was
the
protection
of
seamen
particularly
against
the
compulsory
arbitration
of
seamen's
wages,
the
right
to
put
ship
in
harbor,
protection
under
the
jones
act
and
the
right
to
food.
these
were
the
things
that
were
mentioned
in
the
analysis
in
the
discussion
and
--
and
partly
in
the
resolution.
and
whether
it
includes
railway
men
and
transportation
workers,
let
me
quote
to
you
what
was
said
in
the
analysis,
“the
seamen
having
made
the
contract
to
serve
must
serve.
the
railroad
man
having
entered
into
a
contract
to
serve
with
an
arbitration
clause
inserted
must
continue
to
serve
because
such
contract
that
comes
through
this
law
if
enacted
valid,
enforceable,
irrevocable
save
upon
such
crimes
as
existed
law
in
equity.
and
it
says
further
that
the
--
the
hunger
of
the
--
the
seamen's
hunger
and
the
hunger
of
the
wife
and
children
of
the
railway
men
and
so
with
other
hungry
workers
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce.
that
is
said
out
in
the
analysis
in
the
discussion
and
quoted
in
the
brief
--
in
our
brief.
what
the
--
what
furuseth
was
talking
about
was
precisely
what
secretary
of
labor
wrote,
contracts
of
employment
of
seamen,
railway
men
and
other
workers
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce.
that
is
an
almost
precise
power
to
taking
the
classes
of
workers
at
first
that's
mentioned.
and
when
he
was
mentioned,
it
was
individual
contracts
of
hire,
the
railway
men
with
the
contract
for
arbitration.
the
seamen
with
a
shipping
articles
and
so
with
other
workers
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce.
now,
when
the
arbitration
is
--
when
the
proponents
of
the
bill
came,
they
talked
about
stevedores,
contracts
with
stevedores.
there
is
no
mentioned
in
anywhere
in
this
by
the
proponents
or
the
opponents
of
the
bill
of
collective
bargaining
contracts
except
in
first,
that's
analysis
in
which
he
says,
if
you
put
them
--
if
--
if
the
union
makes
a
collective
bargaining
contract,
it
will
be
an
out
of
danger
because
it
will
bind
the
members.
the
bill
was
brought
up
in
the
next
session
of
congress
and
they
left
out
seamen's
wages.
the
slipper
was
removed.
but
they
still
let
in
any
other
matter
which
are
the
subject
of
controversy
would
be
cognizable
in
admiralty
and
that
be
meant
food,
jones
act,
right
to
put
ship
in
harbor
and
other
protections
which
the
seamen
had
in
--
under
maritime
legislation.
and
so,
they
opposed
it.
and
so
the
american
federation
of
labor
opposed
that
saying,
the
danger
to
seamen's
wages
is
no
mentioned
of
collective
bargaining
contract.
so,
the
american
bar
associations
spoke
about
the
reasons
for
the
opposition
as
being
due
to
compulsory
arbitration
of
seamen's
wages.
it
is
true
that
this
was
proposed
by
commercial
legislation
people
leaving
out
the
aspect
of
--
they
are
trying
to
get
that
seamen's
wages
and
perhaps,
some
of
these
other
things.
they
were
--
what
was
done,
as
a
result
of
the
protest
in
section
1,
was
to
exclude
the
thing
about
which
the
seamen's
union
was
protesting,
namely,
the
contracts
of
employment
of
seamen,
railway
men
and
other
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
such
as
stevedores.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
i
think
so.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
i
think
so.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
well,
i
think
with
respect
to
the
exclusion
that
is
true,
your
honor.
they
excluded
as
a
result
of
a
specific
protest,
the
particular
thing
protested
about
and
for
reasons
--
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
they
cut
that
out.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
now,
when
you
get
to
the
next
section
of
the
bill
that
is
contracts,
evidencing
transactions
involving
interstate
commerce.
i
know
the
argument
that
you
read
one
narrowly
and
you
read
one
broadly
and
you
go
back
to
2441
and
up
to
57
for
another.
but
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
house
report
on
this,
it
says,
and
i
think
it's
referred
to
in
mr.
justice
douglas'
opinion
in
the
--
the
court's
opinion
in
the
bernhardt
case,
the
matter
is
probably
the
subject
to
federal
action.
i'm
reading
from
report
number
96,
whether
an
agreement
for
arbitration
shall
be
enforced
in
that
is
a
question
of
procedure
to
be
determined
by
the
lower
court
in
which
the
proceeding
is
brought
and
not
one
of
substantive
law
to
be
determined
by
the
law
of
the
forum
which
the
contract
was
made.
before
such
contracts,
it
could
be
enforced
in
the
federal
court
before
this
law
is
essential,
the
arbitration
act.
the
bill
declared
that
such
agreement
shall
be
recognized
and
enforced
by
the
courts
of
the
united
states.
the
remedy
is
founded
also
upon
the
federal
control
over
interstate
commerce
and
over
admiralty.
the
control
over
interstate
commerce
reaches
not
only
the
physical
interstate
shipment
of
goods
but
also
contracts
relating
to
interstate
commerce.
now,
i
submit
that
that
is
broadened
to
cover
collective
bargaining
contracts
which
relate
to
interstate
commerce
and
do
not
nearly
relate
to
the
interstate
physical
interstate
shipment
of
goods.
i
think
that
there
is
no
valid
basis
for
the
argument
that
you're
reading
one
broadly
and
one
narrowly
when
you're
talking
about
a
protest
over
a
particular
item
or
particular
category
of
employees
who
signed
shipping
articles
or
railway
men
who
had
contracts
with
arbitration
clauses
in
section
1
with
this
exclusionary
language
and
the
power
of
congress
to
regulate
interstate
commerce
and
this
legislation
in
aid
of
it.
so
i
say
that
that
is
a
ground
which
it
seems
to
me
sufficient
to
distinguish
the
--
the
clauses
in
section
1,
the
exclusionary
clause
and
the
power
clause,
the
coverage
clause
in
section
2.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
collective
bargaining
contract
is
not
a
contract
of
employment
in
the
meaning
of
section
1.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
yes.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
i
--
i
understand.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
well,
i
think
--
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
well,
i
think
you
have
to
go
further,
if
your
honor
please.
it's
a
contract
of
employment
of
workers
in
interstate
commerce
and
they
were
thinking
about,
as
the
legislation
and
what
i've
read
you
or
referred
to
indicates,
seamen
who
signed
shipping
articles
which
have
contracts
--
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
--
of
employment
with
stevedores
--
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
i
think
properly
so.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
yes.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
now,
if
one
has
to
find
the
meaning
of
a
statute
in
terms
of
its
policy,
in
terms
of
the
object
to
be
attained
certainly,
the
policy
of
furthering
labor
arbitration
which
is
embodied
as
a
public
policy
of
the
united
states
in
title
2
of
the
taft-hartley
act
and
in
other
statutes
consistently
from
the
norris-laguardia
act
or
from
the
railway
labor
act
on
them.
the
furtherance
of
that
national
policy
by
the
president's
committee
on
labor-management
which
since
1945
has
made
a
--
a
concerted
appurtenance
referred
to
in
the
brief
to
encourage
the
inclusion
of
--
of
arbitration
clauses
and
collective
bargaining
contracts
even
before
the
policy
declaration
of
the
title
2
of
taft-hartley
and
other
national
policy
which
is
--
it
seems
to
me
almost
--
without
exception
referred
to
as
favored
federal
policy
and
it
indicates
that
this
is
a
perfectly
proper
basis
for
interpreting
section
2
of
the
--
of
the
united
states
arbitration
act.
i'd
like
to
say
one
word
about
section
4
of
the
arbitration
act.
my
brother
makes
a
plausible
point,
apparently
a
plausible
point
about
say,
for
this
agreement
that
the
court
would
have
jurisdiction.
well,
i
submit
that
on
a
number
of
grounds,
the
requirements
of
section
4
of
the
arbitration
act
is
satisfied.
first
of
all,
you
don't
get
jurisdiction
by
way
of
the
contract.
you
get
it
by
way
of
section
301.
and
under
301
and
the
westinghouse
case,
this
is
a
qua
union
controversy.
this
is
a
controversy
not
involving
the
individual
rights,
hiring
contracts
of
individuals
or
accrued
wages.
this
is
a
contract
in
which
the
union
is
the
beneficiary
or
the
promisor.
so,
we
have
a
--
as
chief
judge
magruder
says
that
would
satisfy
section
301
and
satisfy
section
4.
now,
the
reason
i
think,
i
--
i
can
only
speculate
because
there
is
no
legislative
history,
but
you
will
recall
that
the
red
cross
line
and
the
atlantic
fruit
company
case,
it
was
decided
in
1924.
and
in
that
opinion,
mr.
justice
brandeis
said
that
if
an
executory
agreement
will
make
a
rule
of
court,
it
could
be
enforced
even
though
there
were
no
legislation
on
the
subject.
and
i
think
it
was
to
avoid
that
as
much
as
anything
else
that
is
to
say,
executory
agreements
being
made
rules
of
court
which
would
then
allow
the
federal
court
to
enforce
them.
the
congress
apparently
wanted
to
make
sure
there
was
federal
jurisdiction
apart
from
the
contract
itself.
and
i
say
in
this
case
--
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
say,
for
this
agreement.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
say,
for
this
agreement.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
or
under
diversity
action
--
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
or
as
--
as
i
say
--
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
or
--
or
under
protective
jurisdiction,
if
you
like.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
well,
i
think
that
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
which
relies
on
the
aspect
of
federal
jurisdiction
with
the
name
that
you
don't
like.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
well,
i
won't
--
i
won't
press
that,
but
there
are
aspects
in
which
federal
law
or
state
law
or
any
law
available
may
be
used
to
protect
the
federal
policy
where
the
court
has
jurisdiction.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
well,
there's
only
an
hour,
your
honor,
for
a
very
complicated
--
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
--
set
of
facts.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
well,
i
say,
sir,
that
in
the
301,
with
the
gloss
of
the
statute
of
legislative
history
as
i
construe
it
or
the
arbitration
act
though
both
written
in
tandem
as
the
chief
--
as
the
court
below
does,
is
a
sufficient
warrant
as
a
law
of
the
united
states
under
which
this
case
arises.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
right.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
well,
i
say
under
301
and
passing
that
for
the
moment,
if
it
is
not
enforceable
under
section
4
and
that's
the
five-day
procedure,
and
there
are
specific
things
which
we
didn't
employ
in
this
case,
it's
still
enforceable
without
regard
to
that
say
for
this
agreement
clause
under
section
2
because
section
2
says,
it
should
be
valid,
binding
and
irrevocable
--
valid,
enforceable
and
irrevocable.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
well
--
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
well,
i
--
i
recognized
that
and
there
were
all
kinds
of
problems
as
your
honors
know
in
these
cases.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
have
a
federal
statute
which
says
explicitly
that
a
contract
--
collective
bargaining
contract
and
--
and
as
you
construe
contract
evidencing
a
transaction
involving
commerce
shall
be
binding,
enforceable
and
irrevocable.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
you
have
in
section
2
of
the
arbitration
act.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
well,
i'm
not
sure
you
do.
four
says,
in
the
particular
way
under
certain
circumstances
on
a
five-day
notice,
you
can
do
it.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
well,
if
that
were
exclusive,
if
that
were
the
only
way
and
if
the
statute
so
say,
i
would
agree
but
i
think
it
is
not
exclusive.
mr.
allan
r.
rosenberg
now,
may
i
come
back
then
to
the
--
what
i
understood
my
brother
farr
to
say
at
the
outset
that
no
one
is
being
heard
by
this.
well,
all
that's
being
heard
is
the
agreed
rate
structure
and
the
boiardi
case.
let
the
company
decide
but
that
isn't
what
congress
said.congress
said
as
i
--
as
we
interpret
it,
that
there
are
rights
here,
rights
for
which
valuable
consideration
was
given,
rights
to
arbitrate
and
return
for
no-strike
clause
under
a
general
policy
of
favoring
arbitration
and
trying
to
achieve
a
form
of
industrial
peace.
let
the
employees
sue.
well,
that's
going
to
compound
confusion
even
worst
instead
of
having
an
arbitration
which
will
take
the
numerous
cases
and
--
and
put
them
into
a
process
which
does
not
involve
the
courts.
you're
going
to
flood
the
courts
with
what
is
called
petty
litigation.
and
i
am
not
sure
in
the
light
of
the
mead
case
in
which
a
--
the
teamsters
union
was
held
in
damages
for
violation
under
section
301
of
a
--
an
arbitration
clause
along
which
contain
no
no-strike
clause
in
the
contract
for
some
$359,000,
whether
the
--
if
the
employer
refuses
to
arbitrate
the
union
is
free
of
its
obligations.
there
is
a
very
serious
question
as
to
whether
if
the
remedy
of
specific
enforcement
is
not
available,
the
contract
is
illusory.
it
may
not
be
illusory.
it
may
be
that
the
union
or
the
employer
is
liable
in
damages,
however,
small
in
the
employer's
side
it
may
be.
but
a
paternalistic
approach
to
this
thing,
let
general
electric
decide
what
is
arbitrable
and
what
is
not
arbitrable
and
let
the
employees
go
sue
and
bypass
the
union.
it
seems
to
me
it
can
only
lead
to
trouble,
industrial
disputes
and
the
purposes
contrary
to
the
policy
of
the
statute.
