mr.
warren
f.
farr
may
it
please
the
court.
the
basic
issue
in
this
case
is
the
same
as
in
the
other
two
cases.
namely,
may
a
federal
court
compel
performance
of
an
agreement
to
arbitrate
future
disputes
in
a
labor
contract?
and
the
answer
to
that
question
seems
to
me
must
turn
on
whether
the
1925
united
states
arbitration
act
requires
such
a
result.
because
as
the
court
below
held,
as
the
fifth
circuit
held
in
the
lincoln
mills
case,
as
the
seventh
circuit
held
in
the
galland-henning
case,
as
every
other
circuit
courts
that
i
know
of
which
has
faced
this
question
has
held,
unless
you
find
the
right
to
compel
arbitration
in
the
united
states
arbitration
act,
you
can't
find
it
in
section
301.
mr.
feller
has
demonstrated
the
difficulty,
the
confusion
that
inevitably
arise
from
trying
to
rest
and
find
in
301
the
power
to
compel
arbitration
of
a
labor
dispute.
so,
i
think
they
must
first
consider
the
united
states
arbitration
act.
first,
i
might
point
out
briefly
the
facts
in
this
case.
mr.
warren
f.
farr
as
far
as
i
know,
every
circuit
court
which
has
enforced
it
has
done
so
by
virtue
of
the
arbitration
act,
like
the
first
circuit
and
the
fifth
circuit
rejected
301
as
itself
being
the
source
of
power
to
do
so.
the
present
case
like
the
other
two
cases
rose
on
a
complaint
under
301
of
the
labor
management
relations
act,
and
the
--
the
union
sought
to
compel
specific
enforcement
of
two
grievances.
those
grievances
are
set
out
in
the
amended
complaint
at
page
44
and
45
of
the
record.
the
grievances
were
two.
one,
that
an
employee
named
boiardi
was
not
being
paid
the
rate
of
pay
which
he
was
entitled
to
under
his
job
classification.
and
secondly,
that
an
employee
named
armstrong
had
been
improperly
discharged
and
not
for
cuase.
arbitration
was
demanded.
the
company
refused
the
arbitration
on
the
ground
that
the
issues
were
not
arbitrable
under
the
collective-bargaining
agreement.
the
union
brought
suit
seeking
specific
performance
and
damages
on
a
motion
to
strike
the
claim
for
specific
performance.
the
district
court
held
that
it
lacked
power
to
enforce
arbitration
because
of
the
provisions
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
after
that
decision
the
complainant,
the
union,
then
amended
its
complaint
to
strikeout
the
claim
for
damages
so
that
its
cause
of
action
would
ask
only
specific
performance.
it
did
so
that
it
might
have
an
immediate
appeal.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
holding
first
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
was
not
at
bar.
then
it
said,
but
it
isn't
enough
to
say
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
is
not
at
bar.
we
must
find
some
affirmative
basis
on
which
compulsion
of
arbitration
can
be
rested.
now,
they
said
we
can't
find
it
in
the
common
law
because
it
was
long
settled
common
law
that
enforcement
of
executory
agreements
to
arbitrate
would
not
be
compelled
in
the
federal
courts
or
in
a
state
court.
they
turned
then
to
section
301
and
they
say
no,
we
can't
find
in
301
such
a
power.
but
we
do
find
a
statute
which
authorizes
it
and
that
is
the
united
states
arbitration
act.
and
they
held
that
this
contract
was
a
contract
evidencing
a
transaction
involving
commerce
within
the
meaning
of
section
2
of
the
act.
they
held
that
it
was
not
excluded
from
the
operation
of
the
act
by
virtue
of
the
exception
contained
in
section
1
of
the
act,
which
excludes
contracts
of
employment
of
seamen,
railroad
workers,
or
other
workers
engaged
in
commerce.
and
then
they
said
this
being
covered
by
the
act
is
not
excluded
from
it.
we
have
the
power
--
or
the
district
court
has
the
power
under
section
4
of
the
act
to
compel
arbitration.
section
4
providing
that
a
court
of
the
united
states
which
has
jurisdiction
of
the
controversy
between
the
parties
apart
from
the
agreement
to
arbitrate
may
compel
specific
performance.
so
in
the
--
you
might
have
heard
that
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
after
argument
the
union
made
a
motion
to
amend
its
complaint
to
set
up
as
a
basis
of
jurisdiction
diversity
of
citizenship.
the
court
of
appeals
denied
that
motion.
and
whether
the
denial
was
correct
or
otherwise,
i
think
it's
not
at
this
time
before
this
court.
now,
we
turn
then
to
the
united
states
arbitration
act
to
determine
whether
this
case
is
within
it.
the
united
states
arbitration
act
was
proposed
in
1922,
1923
shortly
after
new
york
had
enacted
its
arbitration
act.
we've
traced
the
history
of
that
act
on
pages
13
to
22
of
our
brief.
shown
there
it
was
sponsored
by
commercial
interest.
it
was
--
it
was
--
the
proponents
were
commercial
trade
association.
but
there's
not
a
word
in
the
committee
reports
or
in
the
argument
on
the
house
floor
and
the
senate
floor
showing
this
was
anything
other
than
the
commercial
arbitration
bill.
but
that's
not
all,
because
congress
didn't
merely
not
consider,
the
applicability
of
the
act
to
labor.
it
specifically
did
consider
it
and
specifically
rejected
it.
mr.
feller
pointed
out
that
(inaudible)
found
that
the
provision
with
respect
to
compelling
arbitration
was
objectionable.
that
it
would
--
it
--
it
met
--
it
was
the
same
--
it
met
the
objection
that
labor
had
always
had
up
to
that
time
through
compulsion
on
arbitration.
so,
the
provision
excluding
contracts
of
employment
was
written
into
the
bill.
the
--
that
exclusion
was
put
in
reflecting
at
that
time
the
general
hostility
and
fear
of
labor
to
the
equity
courts.
we
have
to
consider
this
was
1923.
at
that
time
labor
unions
were
bothered
about
the
equity
powers
of
the
federal
court.
but
then
the
yellow
dog
contract,
the
extension
of
the
sherman
act,
the
other
matters
which
this
court
referred
to
in
its
opinion
of
yesterday
with
respect
to
the
enactment
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
labor
was
afraid
and
it
would
not
have
met
--
it
would
not
have
satisfied
labor
had
this
agreement
of
the
statute
applied
to
their
agreement.
now,
it
is
said,
the
court
of
appeals
said
this
does
--
covers
only
individual
contracts
of
hire
with
contracts
of
employment
means
only
individual
hiring.
i
might
say
that
the
court
of
appeals,
first
circuit
with
the
exception
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
is
the
only
court
that
should've
taken
that
position.
now,
what
is
this
contract,
if
it
is
not
a
contract
of
employment?
to
be
sure,
a
collective-bargaining
agreement
does
in
hierarchy?
it's
not
the
hierarchy.
but
what
is
a
man's
contract
of
employment?
it's
not
merely
the
fact
of
being
hired.
it's
the
terms
on
which
he's
hired.
it's
his
compensation.
how
long
he
has
to
work.
what
are
his
rights?
that's
what
anyone
would
normally
think
of
as
meaning
--
as
being
a
contract
of
employment
and
it's
well
accepted,
perfectly
well
accepted
that
the
provisions
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
are
read
into
the
contract
of
hire
of
every
single
employee
under
it.
this
court
said
so
in
the
cases.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
court
itself
in
the
sand
case,
306
united
states,
which
it
quoted
in
the
senate
report
on
301
which
mr.
feller
read
you
this
morning.
this
court
said
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
act,
referring
to
the
national
labor
relations
act,
those
hardly
indicate
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
compel
employers
to
bargain
collectively
with
their
employees
to
the
end
that
employment
contracts
binding
on
both
parties
should
be
made.
this
court
in
1939
was
satisfied
that
that
was
an
appropriate
characterization.
and
we
submit
that,
of
course,
it
is.
now,
it
won't
do
to
say
that
all
mr.
(inaudible)
was
bothered
about
was
the
individual
hiring.
he
specifically
adverted
to
what
would
happen
if
a
union
made
a
contract.
and
in
the
very
analysis
of
the
bill
referred
to
in
the
--
the
same
as
union
convention,
in
his
analysis
of
the
bill
he
points
out
and
i
refer
to
the
extracts
from
his
analysis
printed
at
page
46
of
the
respondent's
brief
in
this
case.
he
said,
“what
about
those
who
seek
to
protect
themselves
through
mutual
aid?”
some
organizations
are
very
strong
and
a
union
may
enter
a
contract.
if
they
show
into
an
--
into
an
agreement
containing
an
arbitration
clause
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
organization
will
be
bound,
but
would
such
action
bind
the
members?"
and
he
concludes
that
it
would.
and
indeed
that
was
argued
this
morning
and
as
i
think
i
must
fully
agree
with
him.
and
as
the
courts
have
consistently
held
the
provisions
in
a
collective-bargaining
agreement
with
respect
to
grievance
procedure
and
arbitration
are
binding
on
the
individual
employee.
what
good
would
it
have
done
--
have
done
therefore?
would
mr.
feller's
set
purpose
have
been
accomplished
if
all
that
was
excluded
from
the
act
was
an
arbitration
clause
in
the
rare
end
where
there
was
an
individual
contract
of
hire,
but
it
was
not
excluded
when
it
was
included
in
the
terms
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement.
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
plain,
therefore,
that
to
give
any
effect
to
that
proviso
it
must
apply
to
the
arbitration
clause
whether
in
a
collective-bargaining
agreement
or
in
the
rare
case
of
an
individual
contract
it
had
such
as
in
the
shipping
act.
now
then,
it
maybe
said
that
although
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
a
contract
of
employment,
it
is
not
a
contract
of
employment
of
a
seaman,
a
worker
engaged
in
commerce
in
this
case.
in
our
case,
we
have
production
and
maintenance
employees.
and
some
courts
have
said
that
the
only
collective-bargaining
agreements
which
are
excluded
--
arbitration
clause
which
are
excluded
are
those
relating
to
transportation
workers,
persons
engaged
in
commerce.
that
is
to
say,
therefore,
that
what
congress
intended
to
do
was
to
provide
for
the
nonarbitrability
of
collective-bargaining
agreements
with
respect
to
workers
engaged
in
commerce
but
to
leave
open
and
subject
to
arbitrability
the
collective-bargaining
agreements
of
workers
who
are
engaged
in
industries
affecting
commerce
or
producing
goods
for
commerce.
there
is
not
the
slightest
suggestion
in
the
legislative
history
or
any
place
else
or
as
to
why
that
distinction
should
be
done.
so
that
we
submit
that
clearly
this
agreement
is
a
contract
of
employment
and
a
contract
of
employment
which
is
therefore
excluded
from
the
arbitration
act.
now
then,
congress,
therefore,
in
the
arbitration
act
made
up
its
mind
that
it
was
not
going
to
provide
for
the
enforcement
of
labor
contracts
--
enforcement
of
arbitration
in
labor
contracts.
commercial
arbitration,
yes,
but
for
reasons
of
policy
it
decided
against
making
specifically
enforceable
provisions
in
a
labor
contract,
a
contract
relating
to
the
employment
of
individuals.
that
was
the
position
it
took
in
1925.
it
is
said
that
it
reversed
that
position,
in
1947,
in
enacting
the
taft-hartley
act.
and
that
it
did
so.
although
it
used
no
words
to
that
effect
and
although
we
submit
a
fair
reading
of
the
legislative
history
shows
that
it
had
no
such
intention.
now,
congress
knew
how
to
provide
for
arbitration,
how
to
provide
for
methods
of
compelling
arbitration
if
it
wanted
to.
the
1925
arbitration
act
shows
that
it
knew
how
to
do
it
if
it
wanted
to.
the
amendments
to
the
railway
labor
act
which
this
court
considered
in
its
opinion
of
yesterday
in
the
brotherhood
case
showed
that
congress
knew
how
to
do
it
when
it
wanted
to.
in
that
act,
for
example,
with
respect
to
minor
disputes
it
set
up
a
procedure
under
which
both
parties
had
to
go
to
arbitration.
when
it
came
to
major
disputes
on
the
other
hand,
it
was
very
careful
to
say
that
this
shall
remain
voluntary
and
neither
party
is
obligated
to
do
so.
it
knew
how
to
deal
with
an
arbitration
question
if
it
wanted
to.
so,
we
come
then
to
the
provisions
of
the
labor
management
relations
act.
and
do
they
change
the
situation?
now,
you
certainly
don't
find
anything
in
the
language
of
the
act
that
suggests,
in
anyway,
that
congress
was
now
for
the
first
time
deciding
as
a
matter
of
policy
that
arbitration
under
labor
agreements
should
be
enforced
when
it
had
decided
in
1925
that
they
should
not
be
enforced.
what
is
the
language?
suits
for
violation
of
contract
between
an
employer
and
the
labor
organization
may
be
brought
in
any
district
court
of
the
united
states
without
regard
to
the
amount
in
controversy
or
diversity
of
citizenship.
does
that
sound
in
anyway
like
a
policy
declaration
that
arbitration
agreement
should
be
enforceable
and
that
the
federal
court
should
have
the
power
to
enforce
it?
it
certainly
does.now,
they
sought
to
draw
out
--
to
draw
out
of
a
few
phrases
in
the
senate
report
a
contrary
--
a
contrary
policy
to
that
congress
had
adopted
before.
mr.
feller
said
that
the
purpose
--
the
purpose
of
301
was
to
create
a
substantive
right
to
the
enforcement,
collective-bargaining
agreement.
and
then
that
necessarily
embraced
a
substantive
right
to
the
enforcement
of
arbitration
clause.
i
think
the
fair
reading
of
the
majority
report
and
the
minority
report
shows
clearly
that
there
was
no
such
intention
on
the
part
of
congress.
what
was
congress
faced
with
in
conjunction
with
section
301?
it
was
faced
with
the
--
as
the
reports
say
again
and
again,
it
was
faced
with
the
procedural
difficulties
of
employers
suing
unions.
there
was
no
procedural
difficulty
to
unions
suing
employers
that's
been
sued
time
and
time
again.
it
was
not
faced
with
the
lack
of
any
substantive
right
to
enforce.
employers
had
been
sued
on
collective-bargaining
agreements
long
prior
to
the
taft-hartley
act.
and
employers
had
sued
unions.
the
minority
report
of
the
senate
and
the
house
both
referred
to
a
case
as
one
example
of
it
in
265
f.397,
where
an
employer
sued
a
union
for
breach
of
a
no-strike
clause
and
recovered
a
1920
case,
a
suit
brought
on
the
basis
of
diversity
of
citizenship.
there's
no
doubt
that
there
was
a
contract
which
was
enforceable.
the
difficulty
was
purely
procedural.
now,
congress
--
how
did
congress
go
about
correcting
that
difficulty?
but
it
did
--
it
could
not,
of
course,
make
the
state
change
their
methods
of
procedure
with
respect
to
suing
an
unincorporated
association.
so,
it
said
the
remedy
is
to
make
a
labor
union
an
entity
for
purposes
of
suit
in
the
federal
court.
and
they
did
that.
they
--
and
that's
all
they
did.
what
they
wanted
to
do
was
to
bring
the
union
up
to
the
level
of
the
employer
with
respect
to
suability
so
far
as
procedure
went
and
not
so
far
as
substance
went
because
they
didn't
have
to
create
a
substantive
right.
and
as
the
committee
reports
point
out,
there
is
no
doubt
that
under
state
law
collective
agreements
are
enforceable.
they
are
state
contracts
and
they're
governed
by
state
law.
indeed,
if
congress
had
wanted
to
create
a
substantive
federal
right
to
enforcement
of
a
collective-bargaining
agreement
in
the
very
language
of
section
301
in
congress
was
such
a
result.
if
what
congress
was
doing
was
saying
a
collective-bargaining
agreement
is
a
valid
and
enforceable
and
binding
contract,
and
the
mind
of
the
statute
doesn't
say
that,
that's
just
one
phrase
in
the
senate
majority
report.
if
they
have
done
that,
why
provide
in
section
301
without
regard
to
the
citizenship
of
the
party?
because
if
you
have
created
a
federal
substantive
right,
then
you
don't
need
diversity
jurisdiction
to
get
into
the
federal
court,
you
come
into
the
federal
court
on
the
basis
that
this
is
a
cause
of
action
arising
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
the
very
fact
of
what
they
chose
to
remove
was
the
diversity
requirement
shows
that
they
were
not
intending
to
create
a
substantive
federal
right.
mr.
warren
f.
farr
they
left
nothing
in
its
place,
i
submit.
we
think
that
it
is
--
we
think
that
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
certainly
the
minority
reports
indicate
that
they
thought
of
it
that
it
was
clear
but
you
have
to
apply
state
law.
and
i
submit
that
that
is
what
must
be
applied.
that's
all
they
intended
to
do.
now,
do
we
say
that
under
section
301
--
mr.
warren
f.
farr
that
--
that's
exactly
what
the
minority
said
to
the
majority
again
and
again.
mr.
warren
f.
farr
they
were
opposing
it
but
they
were
pointing
out
the
problem.
it
was
certainly
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
majority
that
that
was
the
case.
and
there's
not
a
word,
i
submit,
in
the
majority
report
that
answered
that
it
said
it
isn't
so.
mr.
warren
f.
farr
it
--
as
to
their
wisdom,
it
doesn't
--
mr.
warren
f.
farr
all
i'm
saying
is
that
congress
knew
what
it
was
doing
when
it
did
it
because
the
minority
said
this
is
what
you're
going
to
have
to
face.
mr.
warren
f.
farr
i
--
i
think
that's
correct.
now,
i
say
that
the
majority
doesn't
say
--
doesn't
say
we
are
creating
a
federal
substantive
right
at
all.
the
majority
doesn't
say
that.
it
doesn't
say
so
in
the
--
in
the
language
of
the
section,
and
it
doesn't
say
so
in
its
report.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
when
it
doesn't
say
that
it
knew
--
it
knew
what
it
was
doing.
knew
what
it
was
doing.
it
wasn't
just
by
inadvertence
that
it
removed
the
diversity
requirement
and
then
thought
somehow
rather
there
was
something
to
be
applied.
mr.
warren
f.
farr
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
that
the
phraseology
is
--
is
very
simple.
it's
very
long
and
difficult.
it
says
suits
for
violations
of
contract
may
be
brought
in
the
district
court
without
regard
to
diversity
of
citizenship.
i
think
that
on
its
face
finally
show.
all
we're
doing
is
removing
the
diversity
requirement
in
this
kind
of
a
case,
just
as
you
removed
the
diversity
requirement
in
cases
perhaps
involving
federal
instrumentalities
or
federal
corporations
which
--
which
the
united
states
don't
have
to
stop.
it's
a
purely
procedural
kind
of
section,
it
seems
to
me.
and
now,
if
congress
was
trying
to
create
a
substantive
right
--
if
it
is
trying
to
create
a
substantive
right,
what
was
it
doing?
was
it
taking
over
from
state
the
rights
on
the
collective-bargaining
agreements
which
the
state
had
always
had?
prior
to
section
301,
i
submit,
there
was
no
doubt
that
if
--
that
a
collective-bargaining
agreement
was
a
state
agreement.
of
course,
it
was.
if
it
was
an
agreement
at
all
it
arose
under
state
law.
under
the
--
under
the
original
national
labor
relations
act
there
were
collective-bargaining
agreements.
the
court
referred
to
it
in
fact
in
the
sand
case.
the
purpose
was
to
make
them
binding.if
they
were
binding
by
virtue
of
what
law
were
they
binding
them
--
bound,
binding
by
virtue
of
federal.
the
same
thing
is
true
with
respect
to
the
railway
labor
act.
this
court
held
in
the
travel
case
in
345
united
states,
where
a
contract
made
by
a
union
representing
airline
employees
of
a
carrier
subject
to
the
railway
labor
act.
in
that
case
an
individual
employee
was
discharged
and
brought
suit.
the
question
as
to
whether
he
had
the
right
to
bring
suit
before
first
exhausting
his
remedies
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure
was
held
by
this
court
to
be
a
question
of
state
law.
mr.
justice
burton
said
this
is
a
missouri
contract
to
be
governed
by
missouri
law
unless
we
find
it
inconsistent
with
the
provisions
of
the
railway
labor
act.
there
was
nothing
inconsistent
and
therefore
this
court
held
you've
got
to
exhaust
your
remedies
because
missouri
says
you
must.
mr.
warren
f.
farr
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
taft-hartley?
mr.
warren
f.
farr
i
can't
say
i
have
but
i
can
say
that
my
investigation
of
that
has
been
as
exhaustive
as
it
should
have
been
--
i
have
not
read
all
the
hearing
by
any
manner
or
means.i
find
nothing
in
any
of
the
report
or
of
--
in
the
legislative
considerations
before
the
house
and
the
senate
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
warren
f.
farr
i
have
read
--
i
have
read
many
opinions
--
mr.
warren
f.
farr
--
of
the
lower
courts
dealing
with
it.
mr.
warren
f.
farr
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
warren
f.
farr
i
have
--
i
have
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
mr.
feller
pointed
out
in
his
brief
and
suggested
yesterday.
of
course,
we
didn't
want
this.
we
don't
like
it.
we
would
prefer
the
other
rule
with
collective-bargaining
agreements
not
be
enforceable
but
it's
too
late
to
argue
that
now.
and
he
says
i
think
in
his
brief
that
that
fairly
reflect
the
position
of
--
of
labor.
mr.
warren
f.
farr
certainly,
they're
entitled
to
a
windfall
if
they
have
it.
the
question
is
did
they
get
it?
now,
so
i
said
that
if
as
it
seems
clear
that
all
congress
was
doing
in
section
301
was
opening
the
doors
in
the
federal
courts
regardless
of
diversity
to
the
enforcement
of
collective
agreements
which
were
valid
under
state
law.
you
don't
find
in
that
the
creation
of
a
substantive
right,
the
right
to
compel
arbitration
which
didn't
exist
up
to
that
time
in
which
congress
had
specifically
determined
in
1925
shouldn't
exist.
you
don't
have
that
situation
at
all.
now,
is
it
--
is
it
a
bad
thing
that
you
don't
have
it?
is
it
essential
that
somehow
or
other
collective
--
by
--
arbitration
clause
is
in
collective-bargaining
agreement
should
be
enforced?
must
we
try
to
dig
out
of
language
in
the
taft-hartley
act
not
applicable
to
the
situation
some
means
of
doing
it
because
the
need
is
so
urgent
and
the
end
is
so
desirable
and
justifiable?
and
i
submit
that
we
need
not.
mr.
goldberg
pointed
out
yesterday
that
in
his
long
experience
with
labor
arbitration
it
was
the
very,
very
rare
case
where
you
ever
got
to
the
point
when
you
had
to
go
to
court.
and
other
students
of
the
problem
have
arrived
with
the
same
conclusion.
much
consideration
to
the
question
of
enforcement
of
arbitration
under
labor
contract
is
recently
being
given
because
of
the
proposal
of
the
commission
of
the
newly
formed
state
laws
or
uniform
arbitration
act.
the
committee
of
the
--
labor
committee
of
the
american
bar
association
in
1955
in
a
report
signed
by
professor
howard
who's
one
of
the
commissioners
by
professor
(inaudible)
howard,
charles
gregory
and
others,
waived
the
arguments
back
and
forth
as
to
whether
such
legislation
is
necessary.
professor
howard
wrote
a
long
article
in
the
january
1956
missouri
law
review
presiding
missouri's
consideration
of
the
necessity
for
such
legislation.
he
refers
and
the
bar
association
refers
to
the
reports
of
the
governor
of
pennsylvania's
committee
which
studied
the
problem.
and
the
conclusion
saying
that
the,
first,
that
if
the
rare
case
that
gets
to
arbitration
at
all,
by
and
large
most
problems
are
worked
out
in
the
grievance
procedure.
but
when
you
get
to
arbitration
it
maybe
in
1%
or
2%
of
the
cases
that
you
have
a
refusal
to
go
to
arbitration.
and
that
refusal
as
exemplified
in
these
cases
isn't
just
the
casual
some
of
you
know
that
the
arbitration
clause
has
been
saying
we
don't
want
to
enforce
them.
we
don't
want
it
to
be
enforced.
the
reason
for
it
is
the
parties
had
a
dispute
as
to
whether
the
particular
grievance
is
or
is
not
covered
by
the
arbitration
clause.
employers
don't
and
can't
likely
say,
no
we
don't
like
arbitration
clauses
and
we
won't
--
we
won't
abide
by
them
when
--
when
the
situation
comes
that
we
--
well,
we're
bothered
by
it,
we'll
just
disregard
it.
and
there's
a
built-in
protection.
unions
have
given
no-strike
clauses.
mr.
feller
says
in
return
to
some
extent
for
arbitration
clauses,
the
employer
willfully
and
callously
refuses
to
obey
the
arbitration
clause
that
the
union
has
clearly
resolved
from
its
no-strike
clause.
there's
no
--
no
incentive
for
anyone
to
be
arbitrated
willful
about
it.
but
the
occasions
do
arise
when
both
parties
have
a
difference
of
opinion
as
to
whether
or
not
an
issue
is
arbitrable
and
then
you
may
have
a
disagreement.
and
there's
the
--
the
--
well
there
are
no
precise
statistics
on
it,
students
of
the
problem
said
it's
about
in
1%
or
2%
of
the
cases
that
that
occur.
now,
is
the
need
great?
because
agreements
to
arbitrate
on
--
in
labor
contracts
are
not
specifically
enforceable,
is
that
harmful?
well,
the
statistics
cited
by
judge
brown
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
the
lincoln
mills
case
show
that
agreements
--
the
percentage
of
labor
contract
which
have
agreements
to
arbitrate
in
them
increased
from
73%
in
1944
to
91%
in
1952.
and
during
that
period
were
--
were
arbitration
clauses
enforceable?
they
certainly
weren't
enforceable
in
the
federal
court,
not
until
1950
that
any
federal
court
suggest
that
the
arbitration
act
applied
not
until
judge
wyzanski's
opinion
in
the
american
thread
case
in
1953
were
there
are
many
cases
if
the
--
any
other
cases
which
held
that
this
kind
of
agreement
could
be
enforced.
they
weren't
--
were
they
enforceable
in
the
state
courts?
in
some
states
and
a
few
states
but
in
other
states
not.
but
without
machinery
for
enforcement,
what
happened?
labor
unions
increasingly
adopted.
and
they
adopted
them
because
--
an
employer
did
because
by
--
by
and
large
you
don't
need
judicial
compulsion.
the
same
students
of
the
problem
who
say
--
who
point
out
the
lack
of
necessity
for
judicial
compulsion,
point
out
that
labor
and
many
others
well-versed
in
the
field
feel
that
the
intrusion
of
the
judicial
process
itself
may
in
the
long
run
destroy
the
voluntary
nature
of
arbitration
and
do
more
harm
than
good.
the
philosophy
of
the
taft-hartley
act
is
that
if
you
get
people
to
sit
down
across
the
table
and
talk
to
each
other,
they
can
usually
work
out
their
grievance.
now,
they
do
work
out
their
grievance.
you
get
to
up
--
if
they
don't
work
them
out
in
arbitration
--
in
the
grievance
procedure,
you
get
up
to
arbitration.
union
may
say
we
think
this
is
arbitrable.
the
company
says
we
don't
think
it's
arbitrable.
in
most
instances
there
is
an
accommodation
of
one
party
to
the
other.
the
union
will
say,
well,
maybe
you're
right
in
this
case.
we
won't
fret
if
you
won't
go
to
arbitration
or
the
company
says,
well,
in
this
case
we
--
while
we
don't
think
it's
arbitrable,
it's
not
going
to
set
a
great
precedence
then
we'll
go
to
arbitration.
so,
in
most
instances
it's
worked
--
it's
worked
out.
but
to
introduce
into
the
picture
the
right
of
either
party
to
go
to
court
and
what
happened?
i
think
what
happened
is
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
since
the
opinion
in
--
in
american
thread
in
1953,
there's
been
a
flood,
a
rush
of
cases
involving
arbitration
agreement.
there
weren't
any
before
obviously
the
parties
were
not
dissatisfied
with
the
situation
before
because
more
and
more
of
them
adopted
the
arbitration
agreement
in
their
labor
contract.
so
that
once
you
introduced
the
(inaudible)
then
you've
changed
the
situation.
it
encourages
the
union
to
push
as
far
as
it
can.
after
all
a
union
business
agent
owe
some
obligation
to
his
fellow
unionist.
everybody
wants
him
to
play,
and
head
far
and
to
go
as
far
as
you
can.
so,
you
carry
it
for
the
grievance
procedure
and
then
you
take
it
to
arbitration.
and
if,
however,
the
company
refuses
arbitration
then
you
can't
go
any
further,
all
right,
you
go
further.
you
then
carry
it
to
court
whereas
to
have
--
without
that
you'd
have
to
stop
and
the
company
said
no,
similarly
the
company.
company
takes
the
position
that
the
grievance
is
not
arbitrable.
usually
you
--
they
can
work
it
out
with
the
union.
but
if
they
get
to
court
that's
going
to
decide
the
question,
all
right,
let's
go
to
court.
mr.
warren
f.
farr
well,
sometimes
lawyers
are
--
are
pushed
by
their
clients.
in
one
case
i
had
recently
involving
this
question
of
the
arbitrability
of
enforcement
of
a
labor
--
provision
to
arbitrate
in
a
labor
contract.
we
tried
the
matter
--
the
matter
was
tried
and
that
it
was
the
case
--
companions
of
this
--
this
case
was
in
the
first
circuit,
the
case
of
boston
herald-traveler.
in
that
case
after
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
the
question
came
up
before
the
district
court
as
to
whether
the
matter
was
arbitrable
or
not.
district
court
held
that
it
was
not
arbitrable.
the
union
appealed.
the
union
lawyer
was
saying,
“well,
look
we
--
we
really
don't
think
we're
going
to
win
on
this.”
and
they
didn't
because
the
first
circuit
affirmed
judge
sweeney.
we
don't
really
think
they're
going
to
win
on
this.
but
after
all
the
union
boys
feel
that
you
ought
to
go
as
far
as
you
can
and
the
representative
has
to
satisfy
their
constituents.
so,
now,
i
don't
say
--
i'm
surely
not
taking
the
position
that
as
a
matter
of
policy
you
shouldn't
have
judicial
enforcement
of
arbitration
agreements.
i
simply
say
that
there
are
weighty
considerations
and
that
those
who
have
--
who
entered
in
the
field
feel
that
it's
a
debatable
matter.
now,
that
--
mr.
warren
f.
farr
that's
exactly
--
that
is
exactly
the
point
just
as
the
states
are
now
considering
whether
or
not
they
are
to
adopt
a
uniform
arbitration
act.
as
a
matter
of
policy
is
it
a
good
thing?
and
as
i
say
the
missouri
experience
shows
the
bar
association
there
considered
the
time
--
time
from
1949
to
1955
included.
on
the
whole
we
don't
think
it's
a
good
thing.
so,
we're
going
to
oppose
it.
mr.
warren
f.
farr
oh,
yes.
mr.
warren
f.
farr
i
--
i
agree.
the
state
can
adopt
one
view.
congress
may
conclude
that
that's
enough.
congress
may
conclude
that
it's
not
enough.
that
in
addition
to
state
enforcement
the
federal
court
thought
to
get
into
the
field.
but
you
have
first
that
question.
should
there
be
or
shouldn't
be
and
i
say
that's
the
quality
of
the
question.
and
then
you
have
a
second
question
once
you've
done
that.
what
--
what
should
be
the
procedure?
under
what
should
be
the
safeguard
if
you
decide
that
these
clauses
should
be
enforced?
now,
the
arbitration
act
is
laid
down.
they
set
a
number
of
standards
or
provisions
for
subpoena,
provisions
as
to
methods
of
review,
confirmation
and
so
on.
are
those
provisions
desirable
in
a
labor
arbitration?
maybe
they
are,
maybe
they
aren't.
those
who
oppose
the
uniform
arbitration
act
is
applied
to
labor
arbitration
there
have
made
objections
to
certain
of
the
provisions,
thinking
somewhat
to
strengthen
that
they
aren't
enough.
what
are
you
going
to
do
if
you
decide
to
enforce
agreements
to
arbitrate
in
a
labor
contract
when
the
contract
provides
that
you'll
arbitrate
the
terms
of
a
future
contract
or
you'll
arbitrate
the
terms
in
which
the
contract
will
be
renewed?
should
that
or
should
that
not
be
subject
to
arbitration?
judge
wyzanski
held
recently
in
the
potter
press
case
in
massachusetts
in
143
federal
supplement
that
it
shouldn't
be
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
which
in
this
case
held
that
agreement
to
arbitrate
are
enforceable
said,
"well,
not
that
kind
of
an
agreement
because
that's
not
a
judicial
kind
of
a
dispute."
now,
there's
a
line
to
be
drawn.
and
i
submit
that
you
get
a
lot
of
questions
of
policy
which
have
to
be
considered
--
appropriately
should
be
considered.
and
in
the
mean
time
if
the
court
is
not
enforcing
them,
who's
apparently
no
one's
been
heard
up
to
now
because
the
use
of
arbitration
(inaudible).
moreover
--
moreover
the
employees
have
their
right.
a
fellow
would
have
you
believe
that
you
have
either
arbitration
or
a
strike
because
you
don't
have
either
arbitration
or
a
strike.
the
union
has
two
rights.
it
has
the
right
to
strike
and
the
right
to
go
to
law.
whereas
as
in
the
westinghouse
case
it
decided
to
go
to
law.
the
employees
have
the
right
to
go
to
law
if
they
aren't
paid,
if
their
seniority
provisions
are
--
are
being
disregarded.
if
they
aren't
getting
the
pension
that
they're
entitled.
in
all
those
instances
you
have
recourse
to
the
court.
now,
one
--
one
further
(inaudible)
in
this
particular
case
here
--
mr.
warren
f.
farr
i
think
it
is
in
the
present
posture
of
the
lincoln
mills
case.
the
lincoln
mills
case
is
moot,
it
seems
to
me,
unless
you
have
--
unless
the
effect
of
the
arbitration
is
going
to
have
something
to
do
with
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
warren
f.
farr
that
--
that's
true.
mr.
warren
f.
farr
there
may
be.
i
won't
say,
of
course,
that
there
may
not
be
some
disputes
under
a
contract
--
labor
contract,
which
are
not
the
stuff
from
which
judicial
disputes
are
ordinarily
made,
which
the
court
deny.
usually
they
are.
now,
of
course,
the
questions
of
discharge
that's
the
thing
the
courts
deal
with
every
day.
there
are
questions
of
the
rate
of
pay,
the
courts
deal
with
that
all
the
time.
it
may
be
that
to
determine
a
rate
of
pay,
a
court
would
have
to
--
have
to
first
determine
methods
of
whether
the
workload
has
properly
been
established
on
that.
the
courts
often
have
to
determine
difficult
questions
before
they
get
to
the
simple
question
as
to
whether
a
man
is
who
is
not
entitled
to
pay
or
not.
mr.
warren
f.
farr
well
--
mr.
warren
f.
farr
if
you
get
--
if
a
man
who
claims
that
he
shouldn't
have
been
--
he
shouldn't
have
that
--
when
you
say
it
makes
no
difference
to
his
pay?
mr.
warren
f.
farr
assuming
it
makes
no
difference
to
his
pay,
i
don't
know
but
what
he
would
have
a
--
a
right
to
a
determination
of
a
court.
assuming
that
he's
not
compelled
to
go
through
grievance
and
arbitration
provision,
he
can't
arbitrate
if
the
arbitration
here
was
not
enforceable.
why
doesn't
he
have
an
individual
right
to
a
determination
by
the
court
by
way
of
declaratory
judgment
for
example
as
to
whether
he
can
or
cannot
do
it.
i
don't
say
that
in
--
in
such
instances
in
every
case
that
kind
of
thing
will
be
completely
satisfactory.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
in
the
bulk
of
the
cases
it
isn't
essential
and
if
ultimately
congress
should
decide
that
it
is
one
kind
control,
provide
it
in
the
meantime,
nobody
is
being
very
much
heard.
now,
one
further
--
though
i
--
i
--
i'm
saying
that
so
far
as
the
united
states
arbitration
act
is
concerned,
this
contract
can't
be
enforced
under
it.
that
you
can't
find
in
section
301
the
means
of
enforcing
it
and
therefore
it's
not
important.
there's
one
further
basis
that
i
haven't
discussed
on
which
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong
in
holding
that
this
contract
is
enforceable
under
the
united
states
arbitration,
and
that
is
section
4
of
that
act.
section
4
of
the
act
provides
the
machinery
under
which
the
court
can
specifically
enforce
the
agreement
to
arbitrate
if
the
agreement
is
covered
by
the
act.
we
say
this
agreement
isn't,
but
assuming
we're
wrong.
we'll
still
say
it
can't
be
enforced.
that
section
provides
that
the
district
court
--
the
district
court
which
saved
for
such
agreement
would
have
jurisdiction
under
title
28
in
a
civil
action
of
the
subject
matter
of
a
suit
arising
out
of
the
controversy
between
the
parties
may
order
arbitration.
and
what
that
means
is
this.
we've
got
to
look
to
the
district
--
the
district
court,
put
aside
based
on
the
agreement
to
arbitrate.
put
aside
the
agreement
to
arbitrate,
look
what
the
controversy
is
between
the
parties
and
then
see
whether
a
district
court
would
have
jurisdiction
of
that
controversy
under
title
28
or
as
section
4
formally
read
under
the
judicial
code
at
law
or
in
equity.
now,
what's
the
dispute
here?
the
dispute
here
is
whether
mr.
boiardi
was
improperly
paid
and
mr.
armstrong
was
improperly
fired.
did
the
district
court
have
jurisdiction
under
title
28
of
the
--
that
controversy
between
the
parties?
we
submit
it
did
not.
it
did
not
on
the
basis
of
diversity
of
citizenship
because
there's
no
diversity.
it
did
not
on
the
basis
of
the
case
being
one
arising
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states
because
what's
sought
to
be
enforced
here
are
the
provisions
of
a
collective-bargaining
agreement,
and
the
cases
i
think
make
it
perfectly
plain
that
simply
because
you
have
a
collective-bargaining
agreement
you
don't
have
a
case
arising
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
the
agreement
may
have
been
made
apart
from
301,
apart
from
the
construction
of
301
and
adopted
and
is
followed.
the
agreement
may
have
been
made
by
virtue
of
--
because
with
a
bargaining
representative
is
authorized
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
that
doesn't
make
the
case
of
one
arising
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states,
because
to
arise
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states,
the
controversy
must
be
one
which
involve
the
construction
of
validity
of
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
and
this
involves
simply
the
construction
of
a
contract
provision.
so,
we
say
the
federal
district
court
here
had
no
jurisdiction
under
title
28.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
completely
ignores
the
requirement
that
it
be
under
title
28
and
says
well,
it's
enough
--
it's
enough
notwithstanding,
the
provisions
of
section
4.
it's
enough
if
the
court
has
jurisdiction
under
section
301.
did
the
court
have
jurisdiction
under
section
301,
save
for
the
agreement
to
arbitrate?
did
it
have
jurisdiction
of
the
controversy
between
the
parties
apart
the
agreement
to
arbitrate?
the
controversy
between
the
parties
was
mr.
boiardi's
pay
and
mr.
armstrong's
discharge.
perfectly
obvious,
had
mr.
armstrong
or
mr.
boiardi
sued,
had
the
union
sued
for
them.
under
westinghouse,
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction
under
section
301
because
the
controversy
was
one
involving
the
uniquely
personal
right
of
two
employees.
mr.
warren
f.
farr
judge
magruder
did
not
mention
the
gully
case
in
this
case.
he
did
refer
to
the
gully
case
in
his
opinion
in
the
second
mead
case,
where
he
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
section
301
(a).
i
may
say
with
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
warren
f.
farr
that's
a
different
problem.
i
may
say
with
respect
to
section
4
and
i
think
it
ought
to
be
said
in
fairness
to
the
court
of
appeals.
this
question
was
not
argued
before
them
nor
indeed
was
there
much
given
to
the
court
of
appeals
by
way
of
legislative
history
which
we've
included
in
our
brief.
mr.
rosenberg
has
in
his
and
mr.
feller
has
in
his.
and
it
wasn't
for
this
reason.
the
district
court
--
the
decision
turned
in
the
norris-laguardia
act.
when
we
got
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
union
did
suggest
that
maybe
in
addition
to
301
you
could
get
rights
under
the
united
states
arbitration
act.
at
that
time
all
the
cases,
practically
all
the
cases
that
held
the
united
states
arbitration
act
didn't
apply.
the
union
didn't
push
the
point
very
hard.
we
didn't
consider
it
very
strong
and
nobody
paid
much
attention
to
it.
but
the
court
of
appeals
having
apparently
been
persuaded
by
our
argument
that
301
didn't
give
any
such
right
have
then
turned
to
the
arbitration
act
and
for
the
first
time
had
to
spend
some
time
working
out
the
arbitration
act.
so,
this
section
4
point
wasn't
argued
before
them
and
far
as
i
know
it's
never
been
argued
before
any
other
court
of
appeals
which
is
considered
today.
so
we
say,
therefore
that
you
can't
arbitrate
--
force
arbitration
under
the
arbitration
act
(1)
because
this
collective-bargaining
agreement
is
excluded
from
the
act
by
virtue
of
the
provisions
of
section
1.(2)
--
mr.
warren
f.
farr
yes,
sir.
mr.
warren
f.
farr
that's
correct
and
the
--
and
--
mr.
warren
f.
farr
well
--
mr.
warren
f.
farr
well,
what
--
mr.
warren
f.
farr
not
--
what
--
in
1925
it
said
--
mr.
warren
f.
farr
no,
and
that's
right.
in
1925,
what
section
4
said
that
having
jurisdiction
under
the
judicial
code
at
law
or
in
equity
or
admiralty
under
the
judicial
code.
and
the
judicial
code,
of
course,
embraced
the
diversity
cases
--
cases
arising
in
the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
that's
all.
and
that's
all
that
congress
contemplated.
mr.
warren
f.
farr
and
that's
all
that
title
28
still
contains.
mr.
warren
f.
farr
section
1?
mr.
warren
f.
farr
well,
my
point
is
this
--
mr.
warren
f.
farr
yes.
mr.
warren
f.
farr
this
section
4
point?
section
4
says,
put
aside
the
agreement
to
arbitrate
and
see
if
the
district
court
has
jurisdiction
of
the
controversy
under
the
judicial
code
or
under
title
28.
you've
got
to
look
at
the
basic
controversy.
now,
obviously,
if
for
example,
you
have
a
commercial
arbitration.
the
seller
agrees
to
sell
some
potatoes
and
the
buyer
says
they're
bad
potatoes.
and
the
seller
wants
to
enforce
an
arbitration
clause
in
the
sales
agreement.
where
did
he
go
to
enforce
it?
section
4
tells
you
where
he
goes.
he
goes
to
the
court
which,
had
there
been
no
arbitration
clause,
would
have
had
jurisdiction
over
this
controversy.
what's
this
controversy?
this
controversy
is
whether
there's
a
breach
of
the
sales
agreement
or
not.
mr.
warren
f.
farr
or
--
or
for
any
remedy.
mr.
warren
f.
farr
for
any
remedy
other
than
arbitration.
that's
right.
now
then,
the
court
has
got
to
have
it.
the
act
then
said
the
judicial
code,
not
title
28.
and
what's
the
basis?
diversity
of
citizenship
or
it's
a
case
arising
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
and
we
submit
that
the
court
--
the
district
court
in
this
case
didn't
have
it.
but
even
if
you
adopt
judge
magruder's
view
and
you
say
well,
it's
enough
that
this
jurisdiction
under
301,
the
basic
controversy
in
this
case
is
one
over
which
the
district
court
had
no
jurisdiction
under
301
because
the
basic
controversy
is
whether
mr.
boiardi
was
being
paid
too
little
and
mr.
armstrong
was
improperly
fired.
mr.
warren
f.
farr
and
if
that
isn't
a
unique
--
with
personal
right
under
the
westinghouse
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
warren
f.
farr
yes,
i
--
i
think
the
gully
case
entirely
supports
my
position.
it's
simply
because
you
have
a
question
as
to
a
--
a
violation
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement,
you
don't
have
a
case
arising
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
because
to
arise
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states,
what
has
got
to
be
involved
is
the
construction
or
application
of
a
statute
which
will
determine
the
plaintiff's
case
one
or
the
other.
now,
there's
no
statute
in
the
united
states
which
will
determine
one
way
or
the
other
whether
mr.
boiardi
gets
paid
more
or
not.
so,
i
submit
the
court
has
no
jurisdiction
under
section
4.
now,
finally,
the
norris-laguardia
mr.
goldberg
told
your
honors
yesterday
that
every
court
of
appeals
which
had
considered
the
application
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
to
a
case
like
this
was
against
it
(inaudible)
against
our
position
on
it.
and
so
on
accounting
of
(inaudible)
we're
entirely
wrong.
but
every
court
of
appeals
which
has
considered
the
problem
has
i
think
done
it
in
a
very
summary
fashion.
the
lincoln
mills
case
certainly
did
and
the
seventh
circuit
recently
did
and
i
don't
believe
with
the
exception
of
the
court
below,
i
don't
believe
anyone
has
ever
really
seriously
considered
the
problem.
now,
our
point
with
respect
to
the
norris-laguardia
act
is
this.
here
is
a
labor
dispute.
there's
no
doubt
about
that
at
all.
controversy
involving
services,
conditions
of
employment
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
norris-laguardia
act,
as
everybody
admits,
is
still
in
existence
notwithstanding,
taft-hartley.
therefore,
it
applies.
now,
what
does
the
norris-laguardia
act
say?
section
7
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
says,
"no
court
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
issue
a
temporary
or
permanent
injunction
in
any
case
involving
a
growing
out
of
a
labor
dispute
except
if
certain
conditions
are
met."
certain
allegations
made,
certain
findings
made
by
the
court.
those
allegations
were
not
made
here.
those
findings
weren't
made
and
we
say
section
7
therefore
is
clearly
barred.
now,
in
the
first
place,
appellate
argues
to
you
that
section
7
merely
qualifies
for
section
4.
section
4
sets
out
a
number
of
instances
in
which
the
court
under
no
circumstances
can
ever
grant
an
injunction
in
the
case
involving
a
labor
dispute.
you
can't
enjoin
anyone
from
striking.
you
can't
enjoin
them
for
becoming
a
member
of
another
union.
and
he
says
that
all
section
7
does
is
to
qualify
the
one
or
two
instances
in
section
4
where
an
injunction
may
be
granted
if
the
means
are
unlawful
or
--
or
there's
coercion.
i
submit
that
section
7
is
intended
to
go
further
than
that.
the
purpose
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
was
to
take
the
court
out
of
the
business
of
dealing
with
labor
disputes.
maybe
congress
went
too
far.
if
you
remember
that
at
the
time
it
was
enacted
labor
and
others
were
seriously
concerned
that
the
federal
courts
were
getting
too
mixed
up
in
the
labor
field.
so
that
congress
decided
to
take
them
out
entirely
except
--
except
to
have
a
case
of
unlawfulness
or
violence.
then
they
may
come
in.
in
every
other
instance
they're
out.
now,
says
the
court
below
well
that's
--
if
you've
got
to
make
the
allegation
from
the
finding
of
section
7
requirements
then
those
findings
would
be
totally
in
apposite
here
and
therefore
you
don't
have
to
make
it,
because
they
don't
have
any
relation
to
the
enforcement
of
an
agreement
to
arbitrate.
that
assumes
it
seems
to
me
that
assumes
that
congress
intended
that
the
court
should
have
jurisdiction
in
this
kind
of
appeal.
the
fact
that
you
can't
come
within
the
exception
to
a
statute
doesn't
mean
that
the
--
the
exception
is
to
be
disregarded.
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
exactly
what
the
court
below
has
done.
it
has
sought
to
evade
and
get
out
of
the
plain
words
of
section
7
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
and
we
submit
that
the
act
was
(inaudible).
we
submit
that
the
way
--
what
the
court
below
has
done
is
this.
it
twisted
and
turned
its
way
in
order
to
reach
a
result.
it
construed
contracts
of
employment
one
way
in
section
1
of
the
act
and
agreements
evidencing
a
transaction
in
interstate
commerce
in
another
way.
using
a
rigid
construction
here
and
a
broad
construction
there,
reads
out
certain
provisions
of
section
7
to
reach
a
result.
what's
the
result?
in
order
to
compel
enforcement
of
arbitration
provisions
in
labor
agreement.
now,
i
submit
that
there
is
no
such
clear
policy
that
any
such
tortuous
course
is
required.
that
if
there
is
to
be
such
a
policy,
the
policy
for
congress
to
make,
it
can
make
it
and
when
it
has
there,
then
there's
no
question
but
that
the
--
the
court
can
tolerate
it.
but
that
--
but
that
the
court
should
not
make
it
and
that
it
set
off
on
an
unchartered
sea
which
congress
itself
has
said
was
not
to
be
embarked
upon
in
related
matters.
