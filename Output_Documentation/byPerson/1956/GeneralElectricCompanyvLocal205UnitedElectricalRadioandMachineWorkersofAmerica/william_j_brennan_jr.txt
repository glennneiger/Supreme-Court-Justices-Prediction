they
were
the
ones

were
the
ones
that
were
opposing

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
doesn't
strike
you
as
a
strange
way
to
--
to
establish
suability
getting
to
this
long
phraseology
of
301?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
this
an
argument
--
it's
perhaps
at
least,
in
light
of
the
certainties
that
have
been
argued
here
the
last
couple
of
days
there
may
be
policy
considerations
which
ought
to
have
the
consideration
of
the
congress?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.

in
your

quite

that
--
if
that
fact

not
been
introduced,

it
be
--
correct
the
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
about
the
application
of
the
seniority
clause
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
as
relates
to
assignments,
say,
to
a
night
shift
as
against
the
day
shift?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
think
not.
