mr.
eugene
z.
du
bose
your
honor.
your
honor,
i
think,
first,
that
we
must
get
this
case
in
the
proper
perspective.
mr.
kintner
has
stressed
the
findings
of
conspiracy.
now,
we've
always
maintained
that
there
was
no
such
conspiracy
but
we
were
beaten
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
this
court
denied
certiorari
when
we
sought
to
have
that
reviewed.
but
it
would
appear
that
now
the
commission,
contrary
to
the
teaching
in
the
ruberoid
case,
it
says
that
this
order
is
necessary
to
punish
us
for
our
past
bad
conduct
and
not
merely
to
prevent
illegal
practices
in
the
future.
now,
let
us
first
look
at
this
matter
of
the
delay
and
to
whom
it
is
attributed.
i
think
it's
interesting
to
note
that
the
complaint
here
was
issued
in
november
1944.
the
commission
spent
several
months
in
the
early
part
of
1945
identifying
documents.
it's
then
attempted
to
put
in
a
freight
study
and
on
cross
examination,
my
one
other
for
counsel
for
respondent,
the
period
that
the
freight
data
was
inadmissible,
it
was
stricken
from
the
record
and
nothing
happened
until
april
1946,
when
the
amended
complaint
served.
there
was
no
application
on
the
part
of
respondents
to
delay
it
because
of
the
war.
they
delay
it
solely
attributed
to
the
commission.
from
1946
on,
we
held
hearings
all
over
the
country
and
we
finished
in
the
fall
of
1947,
we
filed
our
briefs
shortly
before
christmas
of
1947,
the
trial
examiner's
recommended
decision
came
down
march
31st,
1948.
there
was
one
final
argument
so
called
before
the
commission
in
february
19
and
january
1949,
then
the
case
was
set
down
for
reargument
on
february
1st
and
2nd,
1950
and
having
been
changes
in
the
commission's
personnel.
and
it
was
three
years
later,
in
january
1953,
that
the
order
here
was
issued.
now,
mr.
justice
brennan,
you
were
asking
about
that
telegram
from
mr.
(inaudible)
and
the
somewhat
naive
advice
that
he'd
received
from
counsel.
we
have
always
maintained
and
the
record
shows
this
that
what
they
we're
talking
about
had
nothing
to
do
with
zone
pricing
of
price
fixing.
it
had
to
do
with
terms
of
sale,
and
perhaps
credit
terms
when
delivery
should
be
made
but
the
counsel
was
super
cautious.
and
however,
the
commission
went
to
find
that
although
the
matter
of
uniform
contracts
of
sale,
was
discussed,
there
was
no
evidence
and
no
showing
that
such
uniform
contract
were
ever
adopted
or
used
generally.
and
that's
from
the
record,
volume
5,
page
3776.
now,
let's
again
get
this
case
back
to
its
proper
prospective.
this
is
the
first
time
in
this
entire
litigation
since
1944
and
it's
the
first
time
since
the
order
was
issued
that
i've
heard
anybody
representing
the
commission
say
that
this
order
merely
prevents
nationwide
matching
of
zone
prices
and
does
not
prevent
local,
regular
meeting
of
prices
in
good
faith
competition.
as
we
read
the
order,
it
applies
to
both
situation.
in
other
words,
this
order,
and
certainly,
we
would
advice
our
clients
that
they
couldn't
use
a
zoned
system
where
either
the
purpose
to
meet
a
low
price
of
the
competitor
or
the
effect
without
any
purpose
would
be
regularly
to
meet
a
competitor's
price
in
any
given
area
and
i
certainly
don't
think
it
can
be
stated
that
this
merely
applies
to
a
nationwide
precise
fixing
of
prices.
now,
again,
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
ultimately,
as
mr.
kintner
said,
the
commission
feels
that
without
this
part
of
the
order,
which
was
rejected
by
the
court
below,
the
same
pricing
pattern
will
continue.
well,
i
know,
we
have
advised
our
client,
and
i'm
sure
that
other
counsel
for
the
other
respondents
advised
their
clients
that
when
the
order
against
conspiracy
which
is
--
will
be
in
effect,
no
question
about
that,
does
actually
go
into
effect,
they've
got
to
change
their
pricing
system
radically
for
we
feel
that
if
a
merely
continuance
to
use
a
same
pricing
pattern
under
the
teaching
of
the
morgan
case
and
the
borden
case
and
the
socony-vacuum
case,
they
would
merely
be
continuing
acts
having
their
origin
in
illegal
agreement
and
would
be
held
to
renew
the
illegal
agreement
by
just
continuing
to
do
the
same
thing
regardless
of
any
actual
meaning
of
the
mind.
i
think
the
law
is
settled
on
there.
now,
what
will
this
order
do?
let's
take
national
lead
as
an
example,
it
has
six
white
lead
plants,
it
not
merely
in
the
east,
a
string
from
new
york
all
the
way
to
san
francisco,
it
has
nine
oxide
plants
which
supply
the
material
for
battery
manufactures,
those
are
located
in
the
east
and
the
southeast
in
texas,
in
los
angeles,
in
san
francisco
and
in
the
midwest.
suppose
national
lead
were
to
adopt
its
new
entirely
different
from
any
system
involved
here
is
new,
nondiscriminatory
zone
method,
withdraw
the
zone
boundaries
so
there'd
be
no
question
of
--
of
possibility
of
injury
to
competing
purchases
in
contiguous
zones.
now,
there
is
nothing
in
this
order
which
would
prevent
national
lead
if
it
acted
initially
from
setting
up
its
own
zone
pricing
system.
then
what
would
happen
to
the
others,
almost
no
other.
so,
acceptance
of
very
smallest
pods
has
the
advantage
of
location.
suppose
sherwin-williams,
glidden,
eagle-picher
wanted
to
compete
for
certain
business
in
a
particular
area
by
lowering
their
delivered
zone
price
to
meet
national's,
which
as
we
read
the
act
is
permitted
by
section
2
(b)
under
clayton
act.
under
this
order,
they
couldn't
do
that
as
we
read
it,
at
least
they
couldn't
do
it
if
they
regularly
try
to
get
that
business
because
we
think
that
the
word
systematically
means
the
same
thing
as
regularly.
now,
what
would
happen?
are
these
smaller
sellers
suppose
to
go
out
of
business
and
yet
as
we
read
this
order,
that's
what
would
happen,
whereas
they
say,
all
right
you
can
use
some
other
method
and
meet
prices.
well,
why
is
it
any
difference?
why
is
it
noncompetitive
to
use
a
competitive
individually
established
zone
method
of
pricing
if
anybody
wants
because
the
customers
want
it
and
competitively
meet
prices
were
necessary.w
hy
is
one
bad
and
the
use
of
say,
an
fob
freight
equalize
system
to
meet
the
lower
prices
of
another
is
perfectly
all
right.
they
say
it's
in
the
context
of
this
page.
well,
we
say
in
the
context
of
this
case,
we've
got
to
make
radical
changes
and
when
we
do
make
radical
changes,
they're
going
to
be
fully
competitive
zone
pricing
if
the
customers
want
it,
or
perhaps
there
will
be
some
other
method,
i
don't
know,
we
can't
tell
it
this
time.
and
also
to
get
this
case
into
it's
proper
setting,
this
court
should
know
that
this
particular
idea
that
respondent
should
be
enjoined
from
using
individually
employed
zone
pricing
where
in
any
area
of
the
country,
there
might
be
meeting
of
prices.
it
was
drag
into
the
case
after
the
hearings,
after
the
filing
of
the
trial
examiner's
recommended
decision
and
by
counsel
for
the
commission
would
made
no
argument
even
before
on
this
point
had
restricted
his
contention
to
the
conspiracy
issue
but
counsel
brought
it
in
on
this
theory.
he
said
that
count
one
of
the
amended
complaint
actually
does
charge,
that
the
individual
use
of
zone
pricing
is
an
unfair
method
of
competition.
there
--
the
commission,
in
ruling
on
his
exception
said,
oh
no,
paragraphs
8
to
10
which
he
was
relying
on,
merely
spell
out,
how
the
conspiracy
was
carried
out
and
it
did
not
allege
separately
and
distinctly
that
the
individual
use
of
zones
was
an
unfair
method
of
competition.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
commission
in
his
ruling
said,
if
it
have
been
the
commission's
intentions
to
charge
that
the
acts
of
each
of
the
respondents
individually
were
unlawful,
it
could
and
undoubtedly
would
have
so
alleged
in
clear
and
unambiguous
terms.
that's
their
own
construction.
however,
they
said,
despite
that,
we
think
that
in
order
to
extricate
the
effects
of
the
conspiracy
and
to
guarantee
against
its
continuation,
this
type
of
order
is
necessary.
under
these
circumstances,
the
respondents
were
given
no
opportunity
to
meet
the
issue.
they
could,
we
believe,
now
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
on
this,
have
brought
full
testimony
showing
that
zone
delivered
pricing
was
desired
by
customers,
that
competitive
products,
and
we
must
keep
this
in
mind
here.
white
lead
in
oil
is
a
paint,
it's
not
quite
a
finished
paint
but
it's
sold
as
a
paint
product
and
you
remember
the
old
master
painter
who
used
to
add
his
own
thinners
and
oils
and
mix
it
up
and
apply,
dry
white
lead,
sold
to
paint
manufacturers
as
an
ingredient
in
ready
mix
of
paint,
directly
competes
with
titanium,
pigments,
with
lithotone
and
with
lead
and
zinc
oxide.
lead
oxides
are
more
or
less
sui
generis
but
many
battery
manufacturers
manufacture
their
own
needs
of
lead
oxide.
now,
since
we
were
denied
that
opportunity,
and
since
we
say
that
the
statute,
section
5
of
the
clayton
act,
clearly,
and
without
any
ambiguity,
states
how
the
commission
may
go
about
declaring
a
method,
the
unfair
and
showing
that
the
commission
is
limited
to
preventing
illegal
acts
bound
to
be
illegal.
we
say
that
we
would
deny
due
process
and
that
the
court
below
correctly
struck
from
the
order
this
particular
provision.
now,
we
keep
hearing
about
the
device
or
the
cornerstone
of
the
conspiracy
was
this
zone
pricing
system.
well,
i
say
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
zone
pricing
system
except
in
a
very
broad
sense.
now,
there
are
four
broad
methods
of
delivered
pricing.
you
got
the
--
the
right
equalization,
the
basing
point,
the
universal
price
throughout
a
nation
and
zone
price.
now,
the
facts
of
this
case
show
that
zones
may
differ
radically
in
size,
in
area,
in
location
of
zone
boundaries
and
in
price
differentials
between
boundaries.
for
instance,
the
white
lead
in
oil
agreement,
illegal
agreement
concerned
13
zones.
dry
white
lead
had
only
two
zones,
a
par
zone
up
to
the
rocky
mountain,
and
slightly
higher
west
of
the
rocky's
upon
which
many
products
in
this
country
are
sold.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
commission
conceives
that
the
white
lead
in
oil
zone
were
altogether
different
from
dry
white
zone.
now,
what
importance
is
that?
importance
is
that
there's
no
such
specific
device
as
a
zone
pricing
system
except
in
that
very
broad
generic
sense.
and
if
national
lead,
for
instance,
were
to
individually
adopt
its
none
discriminatory
zones,
it
could
have
all
sorts
of
zone
for
the
different
products
which
would
be
totally
different
from
these
zones
that
the
--
the
court
below
found
were
established
through
illegal
agreement.
mr.
eugene
z.
du
bose
no
sir,
dry
white
--
as
dry
white
sold
to
paint
to
manufacturer.
mr.
eugene
z.
du
bose
yes.
now
--
mr.
eugene
z.
du
bose
well,
there
was
--
mr.
eugene
z.
du
bose
the
--
there
were
certain
variation
in
price
from
time
to
time,
and
certain
products.
mr.
eugene
z.
du
bose
yes,
and
that
is
made
impossible
and
in
the
case
of
dry
white
lead,
because
the
freight
factor
involved
here,
unlike
cement
or
the
heavy
products,
in
the
lead
pigments
deal,
it
was
very
small.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
trial
examiner
found
that
the
freight
element
laid
in
a
delivered
price
here
ran
from
only
2.5
or
3.5%
of
the
--
of
the
delivered
price.
mr.
eugene
z.
du
bose
well,
again,
the
commission
also
in
effect
conceded
that
all
lead
pigments
were
sold
at
very
low
margins
over
the
cost
of
pigment
lead
which
represented
98%
of
the
--
of
the
lead
pigments.
now,
lead
pigment
prices
generally
tended
to
fall
increases
or
decreases
in
pigment
lead,
and
most
of
the
respondents
here
have
to
buy
their
pigment
lead
from
outside
people
that
are
not
involved
in
this
case,
it
means,
in
other
words,
national
lead
has
to
--
has
to
buy
on
the
open
market.
it
doesn't
produce
its
own
lead
from
which
it
makes
lead
pigments.
now,
i
think
it's
important
to
know
as
some
of
your
honors
have
mentioned
that
in
the
new
cement
case,
333
u.s.,
involving
the
multiple
basing
point
system,
where
the
respondents
before
this
court
had
objected
to
certain
portions
of
the
commission's
order,
this
court
took
paints
to
observe
that
the
entire
order
there
was
predicate
on
conspiratorial
action
and
it
specifically
noted
that
the
order
did
not
prohibit
individual,
non-collusive,
delivered
prices
similarly
in
the
gypsum
case
which
was
a
sherman
act
proceeding,
the
defendant
there
had
said
that
the
district
court's
decree
might
be
deemed
to
prevent
individual,
non-collusive
delivered
pricing.
and
this
court
modify
the
district
court's
decree,
despite
the
fact
that
it
said
the
district
court
has
brought
powers
in
bringing
it
decree,
same
argument
made
here
so
as
expressly
to
permit
individual,
non-collusive
delivered
prices.
now,
were
we
any
worse
in
the
people
involved
in
the
gypsum
case?
if
the
district
court
exceeded
as
authority
in
the
gypsum
in
attempting
to
prohibit
individual
prices,
how
much
more,
and
the
same
thing
be
said
here
of
the
commission
which
is
not
at
court
but
in
the
administrative
agency
with
limited
powers.
mr.
eugene
z.
du
bose
no,
sir.
and
there
was
no
finding
here.
mr.
eugene
z.
du
bose
well,
there
was
no
finding,
if
you
may
say
that
their
expression
of
that
in
their
opinion
is
a
--
is
finding
then
--
then
they
did
say
that.
but
they
--
they
based
it
on
no
facts,
no
evidentiary
facts.
mr.
eugene
z.
du
bose
i
think
the
same
principle
would
apply
there.
we
would
say
that
necessarily
implicit
in
the
cement
and
in
gypsum
insofar
that
individual,
noncollusive
delivered
price
should
not
be
prohibited.
now,
we
think
the
proper
rule
is
as
this
court
has
laid
down
in
may
stores,
an
express
publishing
company.
there,
the
national
labor
relations
board
was
involved.
and
this
court,
despite
its
holding
that
the
labor
board
had
brought
powers
in
framing
its
decrees,
stated
that
it
would
be
restricted
to
uprooting
the
illegal
practices
found
to
exist
and
like
or
related
unlawful
acts.
now,
there
has
been
absolutely
no
finding
of
illegality
here.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
case
is
wholly
stranger
or
strange
in
the
light
of
the
consent
decree
entered
against
the
steel
industry
in
1951,
two
years
before
this
order
was
issued.
there,
the
consent
decree
which
the
commission
was
willing
to
accept
or
vice
versa,
commission
suggested
in
would
limit
it
to
the
prohibition
of
conspiracy
to
employ
the
multiple
basing
point
system,
and
the
order
specifically
provided
that,
as
follows,
that
in
--
in
interpreting
and
in
construing
the
foregoing
provisions,
it
is
understood
that
the
federal
trade
commission
is
not
acting
to
prohibit
or
interfere
with
delivered
pricing
or
freight
absorption
as
such
when
innocently
and
independently
pursued
regularly
or
otherwise,
with
the
result
promoting
competition.
that
result,
that
is
a
diametrically
opposed
view
to
the
order
here
in
question.
and
then,
in
the
1932,
the
commission,
in
its
study
of
the
basing
point
formula
said,
probably
the
most
important,
single,
determinative
factor
in
adopting
the
use
of
the
delivered
price
uniform
for
all
destinations
is
the
ratio
of
the
delivered
cost
to
total
production
and
delivery
cost.
if
this
is
low,
with
only
slight
differences
and
delivery
cost,
as
between
destinations
freight
wise
differently
located
a
delivered
price
uniform
for
zones
may
be
a
method
of
quoting
more
convenient
to
buyer
and
seller
and
less
costly
than
an
fob
point
of
origin
price.
in
that
case,
such
a
price
would
not
be
inconsistent
with
price
competition,
and
would
not
be
indicative
of
any
lack
of
such
competition.
well,
here,
i
pointed,
the
freight
factor
was
only
2.5%-3.5%
of
the
delivered
price.
and
the
other
circumstances
would
make
a
different
zone
system,
a
different
form
the
old
system
agreed
upon
for
a
right
within
that
definition.
and
again,
in
1948,
the
commission
said,
where
uniformity
of
delivered
prices
within
a
zone
all
throughout
the
country
has
simple
and
logical
explanations
in
the
nature
of
the
market,
the
product
and
the
transportation
cost.
the
observance
of
such
uniformity
even
in
the
parallel
action
of
a
number
of
competitors,
does
not
in
and
of
itself
create
inference
of
(inaudible)
now,
if
this
order
that
we
have
before
us,
had
merely
said,
and
each
of
you
individually
is
here
by
ordered
to
--
to
cease
and
desist
from
using
the
pricing
zone
described
in
the
findings
or
anything
substantial
is
similar
thereto.
i
don't
think
we
would
have
any
quarrel
before
this
court.
i
don't
think
such
an
order
would
have
been
necessary
because
i
think
the
order
banning
continuation
of
the
conspiracy
itself
requires
some
substantial
change
in
your
pricing
so
that
you
can
show
the
court
it's
such
necessity
--
if
such
be
necessary,
all
the
commission
that
you've
actually
abandoned
your
old
prices.
i
think
you're
absolutely
required
to
do
that
under
the
borden
case.
well,
this
summer,
we
believe
that
the
statute
requires
a
charge
in
a
complaint
and
a
hearing
on
this
subject,
and
that
when
an
order
is
issued
without
any
such
charge
or
hearing,
the
respondents
were
denied
due
process.
we
say
the
order
here
is
not
necessary
to
ensure
effectiveness
of
the
decree
abandoning
conspiracy
and
would
needlessly,
and
as
we
see
it,
if
zone
pricing
were
--
were
to
be
used
at
all
in
this
industry,
it
couldn't
be
used
competitively
and
perhaps
the
smaller
sellers
might
be
driven
out.
for
all
of
the
reason,
we
--
we
submit
that
that
the
seventh
circuit
was
entirely
correct
in
setting
aside
the
injunction.
mr.
eugene
z.
du
bose
yes,
sir.
mr.
eugene
z.
du
bose
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
z.
du
bose
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
z.
du
bose
we
--
we
do
feel
that
way.
mr.
eugene
z.
du
bose
well,
as
i
understood
mr.
kintner,
and
this
is
only
from
my
own
notes,
in
answer
to
questions
from
the
court,
he
said,
as
i
recall
it,
that
this
order
would
not
prevent
meeting
of
prices
and
any
local
given
area
which
is
permitted
by
section
2
(b)
of
the
clayton
act,
but
would
only
apply
to
a
nationwide
scheme
of
meeting
and
precisely
matching
prices.
we
say
that
the
way
we
read
that
order,
you
couldn't
--
if
any
one
seller
adopted
his
own
zone
delivered
price
method,
no
one
else
could
invade
that
seller's
territory
or
zone
price
and
charge
the
same
lower
delivered
price
because,
as
we
say
it,
it
would
be
matching
and
if
you
did
it
regularly,
it
could
be
--
as
said,
to
be
systematically
matching
its
competitive
freight.
mr.
eugene
z.
du
bose
again,
i
--
i
think
it
might
--
it
might
well
result
in
any
--
in
any
competitive
--
that
it'd
be
against
competition.
you
might
well,
here,
as
a
result
of
competitive
forces,
an
independent
action,
ultimately
get
matched
prices
but
that
would
be
as
a
result
of
competition
and
not
as
result
of
this
artificial
scheme.
now,
if
there
is
any
--
a
collusive
scheme
can't
work
on
just
one
seller
and
this
--
mr.
eugene
z.
du
bose
right.
mr.
eugene
z.
du
bose
yes.
mr.
eugene
z.
du
bose
yes.
mr.
eugene
z.
du
bose
yes.
mr.
eugene
z.
du
bose
that's
--
that's
the
subject.
mr.
eugene
z.
du
bose
no,
that's
the
subject.
i
thank
you
put
it
--
mr.
eugene
z.
du
bose
yes.
mr.
eugene
z.
du
bose
oh,
it
would
to
--
it
would
to
--
mr.
eugene
z.
du
bose
well,
as
i
say,
i
--
i
only
said
this
from
my
own
notes.
i
don't
want
to
put
words
to
mr.
kintner's
mouth.
mr.
eugene
z.
du
bose
we
do
say
that,
but
we
don't
think
you
need
to
reach
that
point.
we
say
that
even
if
this
were
a
court
procedure.
mr.
eugene
z.
du
bose
that
that
--
mr.
eugene
z.
du
bose
that's
our
position.
mr.
eugene
z.
du
bose
there
was
no
charge
in
the
complaint.
mr.
eugene
z.
du
bose
no
evidence
on
the
subject,
no
finding,
it
was
dragged
in
at
the
last
minute.
mr.
eugene
z.
du
bose
that
is
true.
but
we
say
that,
for
instance,
in
the
triangle
conduit
case
which
was
perhaps
about
local
authorities
since
the
commission
was
affirmed
by
divided
vote
in
this
court.
there,
however,
there
was
a
separate
charge
in
the
complaint
count
two
which
said
that
the
individual
use
of
the
formula
there
involved
with
knowledge
of
each
seller
that
his
competitors
were
using
the
same
constitute
and
an
unfair
method
of
competition.
and
there
was
a
--
there
were
hearing
on
there
when
the
experts
on
both
sides
and
there
was
a
finding
that
such
constituted
an
unfair
method
of
the
competition.
we
believe
that
if
any
order
here,
even
if
it's
on
the
theory
that
it
helps
to
prevent
evasion,
should
at
least
have
a
basis,
a
finding
of
unfair
competition
in
that
context
before
it
can
be
included
in
the
order.
mr.
eugene
z.
du
bose
oh
yes,
there
was
argument
--
mr.
eugene
z.
du
bose
oh
--
oh,
yes.
mr.
eugene
z.
du
bose
in
--
on
--
on
a
different
theory,
counsel
for
the
commission
objected
to
the
failure
of
the
trial
examine
to
include
a
paragraph
directed
at
individual
prices.
on
the
theory
and
that
is
the
only
thing
that
he
argued
that
count
one,
a
certain
portion
of
count
one
did
actually
charge
of
the
individual
use
of
zone
pricing
was
an
unfair
method
of
competition,
we
did
argue
that
point
and
the
--
the
commission
rule
--
ruled
us
on
that
point
this
other
idea
that
it's
necessary
--
mr.
eugene
z.
du
bose
oh
no.
mr.
eugene
z.
du
bose
oh
no.
mr.
eugene
z.
du
bose
no
your
honor.
