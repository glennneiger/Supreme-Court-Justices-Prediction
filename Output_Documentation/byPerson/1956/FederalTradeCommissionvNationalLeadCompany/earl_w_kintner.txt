mr.
earl
w.
kintner
may
it
please
your
honors.
this
case
concerns
the
validity
of
a
cease
and
desist
order
issued
by
the
federal
trade
commission
which
order
the
commission
feels
is
necessary
to
terminate
a
price
fixing
conspiracy
that
existed
in
the
lead
pigments
industry
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
century.
the
complaint
charged
that
suppression
of
price
competition
was
accomplished
by
dividing
the
country
into
geographic
zones
and
that
the
respondents
charged
the
same
delivered
prices
to
all
buyers
within
a
particular
zone,
irregardless
of
the
location
of
the
buyer.
the
commission
alleged
and
found
that
the
respondents'
use
of
this
system
permitted
the
respondents
to
exactly
match
the
prices
of
their
competitors
at
every
single
point
in
the
country,
in
every
single
zone,
which
was
drawn
by
the
response.
and
that
there
was
no
price
competition
among
the
purchasers
of
this
product
as
a
result
of
the
alleged
price
fixing
conspiracy.
the
order
prohibited
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
it
was
blocked
out,
your
honor,
zone
by
zone.
there
--
and
here
again,
the
pricing
structure
buried
with
the
three
principal
products
in
the
industry.
there
were
varying
zones
allocated
to
each
product.
in
general,
there
was
a
par
zone
and
then
additional
zones
to
which
differentials
were
added
and
the
respondent
sold
at
the
same
price
to
all
buyers
within
each
zone.
that
was
the
crux,
a
difference
per
portion
of
the
price
fixing
agreement.
the
order
prohibited
a
conspiracy
or
agreement
to
sell
at
prices
determined
according
to
the
zone
delivered
price
system,
or
any
system
resulting
in
identical
prices
at
the
points
of
sale.
and
additionally,
the
order
prohibited
the
respondents
from
individually
quoting
and
selling
pursuant
to
a
zone
delivered
pricing
system,
for
the
purpose
or
with
the
effect
of
systematically
matching
the
delivered
prices
of
other
sellers
of
lead
pigments,
thereby,
depriving
purchasers
all
the
benefits
of
price
competition
in
the
industry.
i
think
it
is
essential
and
it
is
this
portion
of
the
order
that
i
have
just
mentioned
that
is
at
issue
here.
i
think
it
is
essential
to
refer
to
the
findings
of
fact
in
this
case
because
it
is
in
the
context
of
those
findings
that
the
commission
feels
that
it
has
exercised
an
allowable
judgment
in
drafting
this
particular
portion
of
the
order
in
question
in
requiring
the
respondents
to
individually
to
each
cease
and
desist
from
the
use
of
a
system
of
zone
delivered
prices
with
the
purpose
and
with
the
effect
of
systematically
matching
the
prices
of
their
competitors
in
this
industry.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
it
is
sir.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
the
court
below
sustained
the
commission's
portion
of
the
order
as
to
conspiracy
and
that
is
not
at
issue
here.
the
respondent,
national,
according
to
the
findings,
is
the
dominant
factor
in
the
lead
pigments
industry,
controlling
an
excess
of
50%
of
the
products
manufactured
by
that
industry.
eagle-picher
controls
a
substantial
portion
of
the
remainder
of
the
industry's
products
which
are
white
lead
in
oil
used
principally
as
a
--
as
a
partly
mixed
paint
and
sold
to
the
dealers,
to
the
painters
and
to
consumers.
a
dry
white
lead,
the
second
product
which
is
primarily
sold
to
manufacturers
of
paint
and
lead
oxides
which
are
including
red
lead
and
litharge
which
are
sold
primarily
or
the
--
as
a
principle
constituent
in
the
manufacturer
of
battery
place
but
also
sold
as
--
in
the
instance
of
red
lead
as
a
constituent
of
red
lead
paint.
the
picture
in
the
industry
prior
to
1933
is
an
--
is
a
picture
of
an
industry
dominated
by
few
manufacturers
and
by
a
dwindling
number
of
manufacturers.
although
the
industry
had
a
dwindling
number
of
factors
prior
to
that
time,
it
was
also
characterized
by
at
least
some
vestiges
of
localized
price
competition,
for
instance,
the
national,
the
largest
factory
in
the
industry
and
the
dominant
factor
in
the
industry
add
589
points
in
40
space
where
the
prices
were
either
equalized
or
where
the
points
were
free
delivery
points.
a
somewhat
somewhere
but
a
different
situation
existed
with
respect
to
the
pricing
structure
of
eagle-picher.
(inaudible),
one
of
the
respondents
which
also
sells
paint
in
its
own
company
own
stores
said,
through
one
of
its
representatives
in
the
trial
of
this
case,
that's
difficulty
was
in
attempting
to
locate
the
equalization
of
points
of
its
larger
competitors
in
order
to
follow
the
price
so
that
there
was
indeed
a
considerable
amount
of
price
competition
prior
to
1933.
this
was
also,
as
has
been
pointed
out
by
the
commission
in
its
findings,
a
--
a
relatively
complicated
pricing
system
in
which
one
competitor
can
never
be
sure
unless
he
knew
in
advance
of
his
--
of
competitors
pricing
structure,
unless,
he
knew
in
advance
of
the
exact
equalization
points
and
also
if
he
had
advanced
knowledge
of
the
exact
freightage
used.
there
are
also
other
practices
in
problem
in
the
industry,
a
difference
in
many
instances
of
conditions
and
terms
of
sale
and
there
was
the
practice
of
diversification
at
which
orders
would
be
accepted
under
old
price
--
on
an
old
price
in
the
face
of
new
increased
prices.
this
was
a
picture
of
the
industry
prior
to
nra
days.
then
in
connection
with
the
drafting
of
a
code
of
fair
competition
under
nra,
meetings
were
held
in
july
of
1933
through
january
of
1934
for
the
purpose
of
drafting
a
code
of
fair
competition
for
this
industry.
there
was
discussion
of
--
during
these
meetings
of
--
for
--
of
a
uniform
basis
of
sale.
a
telegram
from
the
secretary
of
the
association
says
as
follows,
"block
referring
to
the
counsel
for
the
--
for
the
industry
trade
association,
a
lease
agreement
upon
suggested
uniform
basis
of
sale
pending
approval
from
washington
to
code
might
place
us
on
uncertain
legal
ground
and
might
be
embarrassing
later
and
stop.
he
suggest
one
member
to
use
uniform
basis
and
others
follow
voluntarily."
that
was
done.
there
was
discussion
of
a
uniform
agency
or
consignment
method
of
selling
which
the
president
of
national,
stated
at
a
meeting,
quote,
"
permits
us
to
control
the
resale
price."
now,
this
control
of
the
resale
price
was
necessary
because
glidden
and
sherwin-williams,
two
of
the
relatively
minor
but
very
competitive
factors
in
the
industry,
own
their
own
paint
stores.
and
it
was
necessary
that
the
method
be
devised
so
that
the
prices
to
the
consumers
across
the
boards
would
be
the
same.
commission
found
that
the
respondents
agreed
to
and
did
sell
white
lead
and
oil
at
delivered
prices
in
12
zones,
one,
a
par
zone,
and
the
remainder
premium
zones
varying
from
12.5
cents
per
$100
to
$1
per
100
varying
as
to
zones.
there
was
a
also
a
par
zone
in
the
san
francisco
bay
area,
the
other
par
zone
being
roughly
in
the
north
central
and
northeastern
united
states.
the
dry
white
lead
was
a
product
that
was
sold
according
to
a
par
zone
up
to
the
rocky
mountains
with
a
premium
zone
beyond
the
rocky
mountains.
and
the
findings
indicate
that
prior
to
this
time,
the
product
actually
sold
at
less
beyond
the
rocky
mountains
and
it
did
east
of
the
rocky's.
there
was
a
different
--
slightly
different
arrangement
with
respect
to
lead
oxides.
there
were
two-zone,
the
zoning
systems
for
this
product.
one,
for
less
than
carload
sales
and
one
for
carload
sales.
the
less
than
carload
sales
had
a
par
and
four
premium
zones,
the
carload,
two
par
zones
and
one
premium.
there
were
other
arrangements
made,
first
for
a
--
for
a
consignment
basis
for
the
sale
of
white
lead
in
oil.
and
then,
there
were
uniform
discounts
in
terms
of
sales
or
these
products
including
dry
and
white
lead.
uniform
differentials
between
the
case
in
which
the
product
--
the
lead
and
oil
products
were
sold.see,
all
of
that
was
necessary
in
order
to
effectuate
the
conspiracy.
the
parties
also
agreed
to
eliminate
guarantees
against
price
decline.
lead
--
red
lead
and
litharge
sold
on
the
basis
of
six
differentials
over
the
big
lead
prices
of
the
american
smelting
and
refining
company.
in
the
minutes,
concerning
this
transaction,
it
was
said,
it
was
agreed
in
deference
to
existing
statues
that
no
reference
to
prices
should
appear
in
the
outlines
except
for
the
specification
that
prices
were
to
be
agreed
upon
between
the
buyer
and
the
seller.
interestingly
enough,
the
parties
met
--
had
to
meet
a
situation
where
national's,
dutch
boy
brand,
was
a
dominate
brand
in
the
industry
and
possessed
the
--
a
great
deal
of
consumer
acceptance
and
where
eagle-picher
also
had
a
brand
well
known
accepted
by
the
public,
the
eagle
brand
of
paint
that
by
no
means
is
well
known
or
is
accepted
by
the
consumers
as
national's
dutch
boy
brand.
so
the
arrangement
was
made
that
the
other
--
the
products,
the
lesser
known
products
of
the
respondents
should
be
sold
to
the
dealers
at
a
differential
of
25
cents
for
100
pounds
less
in
order
to
encourage
the
dealers
to
push
the
sale
of
the
lesser
known
brands.
but
to
the
consumers,
the
price
was
the
same
across
the
board's
regardless
of
whether
it
was
dutch
boy
paint
or
pigment
are
regardless
of
whether
it
was
a
much
lesser
known
brand
or
indeed
a
brand
that
was
not
known
to
the
consumers
at
all.
this
was
the
only
method
by
which
the
dominant
respondents,
national
eagle
and
eagle-picher
could
induce
the
two
paint
manufacturers,
sherwin-williams
and
glidden,
to
continue
into
--
in
this
agreement.
the
price
in
uniformity
existing
is
indicated
by
the
fact
that
between
1935
and
1941,
16
deferent
bids
were
submitted
by
national
eagle
&
sherwin-williams
to
the
city
of
cincinnati,
11
of
those
bids
were
identical
to
the
fourth
decimal
point.
and
it
is
not
in
mitigation
that
the
bids,
all
the
respondents
to
the
three
federal
government
agencies
were
completely
different.
the
same
situation
as
to
uniformity
of
bids
also
applied
according
to
the
findings
and
bids
submitted
to
the
city
of
milwaukee.
so
in
like
of
these
facts,
which
the
commission
found
existed
pursuant
to
agreement
and
conspiracy
and
resulted
in
absolute
absence
of
price
competition
in
this
industry
for
almost
a
quarter
of
the
century,
i
believe
it
comes
in
for
grace
or
the
respondents'
status
they
do
in
their
brief
and
i
quote,
point
two
of
the
brief
"the
injunction
with
hamper
competition
in
this
industry."
my
question
is
what
competition
in
the
industry
would
be
a
hamper.
the
pricing
system,
the
lawfulness
of
which
say
they
so
stably
defend
is
a
very
one
that
is
a
cornerstone
and
the
essence
of
the
conspiracy
setup
in
1933
and
1934
and
which
prevails
to
the
state.
also,
respondents
have
said,
such
an
order
would
needlessly
restrict
the
lead
pigment
manufactures
and
deprive
them
of
a
valid
competitive
weapon.
in
the
context
of
this
case,
if
the
court
please,
this
system
of
zone
delivered
pricing
has
not
banned
a
valid
competitive
weapon
and
has
not
been
so
used
the
commission
seeks
effectively
to
divest
the
respondents
of
that
weapon.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
exactly
sir.
the
position
is
that
the
order
may
not
be
effective.
the
commission
believes
that
it
has
exercised
its
allowable
judgment
in
terminating
and
requiring
the
respondents
each
to
cease
selling,
according
to
a
system
where
the
purpose
or
effect
is
systematically
matched
prices.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
the
--
the
order
does
not
so
read.
the
order
reads
purpose
and
effect
of
systematically
as
matching
--
the
--
the
order
here
is
sharply
qualified.
now,
it
may
be,
it
will
be
that
the
respondents
may
temporarily,
at
least,
some
of
them
have
to
cease
using
that
zone
delivered
pricing
system.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
it
has
not
been
directed
sir.
only
the
qualified
order
which
is
at
bar
here.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
as
long,
sir,
as
they
do
not
by
doing
so
systematically
match
the
prices
of
their
competitors
and
that
so
long
as
it
is
not
done
for
the
purpose
of
and
with
the
effect
of
systematically
matching
the
prices
of
their
competitors
because
that
is
precisely
what
has
been
done
in
this
instance
for
almost
a
quarter
of
the
century.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
if
it's
--
if
after
the
issuance
of
this
order,
they
systematically
match
prices
to
his
own
delivered
pricing
system.
i
would
say,
sir,
that
that
would
constitute
a
violation
of
the
order.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
they
--
they
have
points
of
production
primarily
in
the
north,
central
and
eastern
portion
of
the
united
states
but
the
--
the
points
of
production
are
varied
as
among
the
respondents.
there
are
some
similarity
as
there
is
a
considerable
similarity
as
to
production
points
but
not
an
absolute
similarity.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
under
the
--
they
practices
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
the
--
yes
sir.
the
--
these
respondents
all
publish
with
the
price
list
and
the
price
list
were
identical
at
every
point
in
the
country
and
made
so
by
this
zone
delivered
pricing
system
which
they
devised
in
addition
to
other
matters
including
uniform
conditions
or
the
term
"sale."
the
opinion
of
the
commission
presents
in
some
detail
here
its
reasons
for
concluding
that
the
provision
in
question
was
necessary
to
eliminate
the
effects
of
the
long
standing
conspiracy
and
to
guarantee
against
its
continuance.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
the
court
below
held
that
the
order
--
that
the
commission
had
no
authority
to
issue
this
order,
that
in
effect,
it
had
exceeded
its
allowable
judgment
saying
also
--
holding
also
that
the
commission
should
have
charge
in
its
complaint
that
the
pricing
system
in
question
constituted
in
effect,
a
perceived
violation
of
the
law
but
not
at
the
commission
not
having
so
charged,
so
alleged
that
it
was
without
authority
to
issue
the
order.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
the
court
below
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
that
is
substantially
the
case
except
that
the
court
seem
to
have
bottomed
its
decision
in
large
measure
upon
the
factor
that
i
have
just
mentioned
that
the
commission
had
not
alleged
that
individual
use
of
this
pricing
system
by
each
of
the
respondents
constituted
an
unfair
method
of
competition
and
not
having
so
alleged
it
could
not
now
issue
an
order
but
it's
a
position
of
the
commission
that
the
whole
factual
situation
was
involving
this
form
of
pricing,
was
alleged
in
the
complaint
and
that
the
findings
adequately
justify
the
action
which
the
commission
here
seeks
to
take.
the
--
it's
commission
position
that
using
it's
allowable
judgment
under
the
statute
and
which
this
court
and
other
courts
has
many
times
held
that
it
has
and
must
have
in
order
to
make
its
orders
effective
in
order
to
effectively
prevent
and
permitted
the
competition
that
the
commission
has
--
must
necessarily
issue
this
type
of
an
order
in
order
to
effectively
terminate
the
conspiracy
and
to
destroy
the
very
vehicle
which
was
the
basis,
the
foundation
and
the
essence
of
this
illegal
pricing
structure
existing
in
the
industry
for
a
quarter
of
a
century.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
of
that
--
had
reference
to
a
telegram
which
the
--
one
of
the
officials
in
the
industry
sent
to
others
in
the
industry
quoting
the
advice
which
he
had
received
from
mr.
lock,
the
counsel
for
the
industry.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
oh
yes
sir,
not
only
that,
but
correspondence
to
the
same
effect.
this,
if
the
court
please,
does
not
involve
--
this
case
does
not
involve
practices
or
forever
inserted
in
an
nra
code.
the
practices
either
were
not
inserted
in
the
code
or
such
as
were
inserted
in
instances
where
practices
were
inserted
in
the
code,
covered
by
the
code,
the
respondents
immediately
secured
exemption
from
it
so
that
the
code
was
never
effective.
the
nra
code
was
never
effective
as
to
the
practices
alleged
and
found
in
this
complaint.

i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.

yes,

it's

but
it's

there
is
your

a
considerable
amount
of
correspondence
and
excerpts
from
minutes
in
this
record
all
to
the
same
effect.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
that
sir
was
in
part
but
the
whole
context
of
the
--
of
the
conspiracy,
all
of
the
facts
surrounding
the
conspiracy
amply
and
extensibly
found
by
the
commission
and
as
to
the
conspiracy
portion
sustained
by
the
court
below
lead
the
commission
to
the
conclusion
that
this
forms
in
--
of
order
is
reasonably
necessary
in
order
to
the
effectuate
a
firm
of
cease
and
desist
order
and
to
terminate
the
conspiracy.
the
commission's
opinion
is
somewhat
extensive
on
this
point.
it
sets
out
in
some
detail
its
reasons
for
issuance
of
this
portion
of
the
order.
commission
says,
for
instance,
they
maintenance
of
the
delivered
price
zones
and
the
quotation
of
delivered
prices
therein
constituted
the
very
cornerstone
of
the
respondent's
conspiracy.
it
was
the
adherence
by
each
of
them
to
this
system
of
pricing
that
made
the
combination
work
unless
the
respondents,
again
reading
from
the
commission's
opinion,
representing
practically
the
entire
economic
power
in
the
industry
or
deprived
of
the
device
which
made
their
combination
effective
in
order
merely
prohibiting
the
combination
may
well
be
useless
gestures.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
yes,
sir.
putting
it
in
another
way
sir,
the
commission
would
have
a
--
paper
of
victory
or
a
stuff
moose
head
on
the
(inaudible)
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
yes,
sir.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
and
it
is
significant
but
in
this
opinion,
the
commission
said
if
after
competition
is
restored,
any
other
respondents
can
make
a
proper
showing
to
the
commission
that
this
prohibition
or
any
other
prohibition
in
the
order
is
no
longer
necessary
or
desirable.
the
commission
will,
of
course,
at
that
time,
take
such
action
as
may
be
appropriate
in
the
light
of
the
facts
in
the
law
and
as
this
court
well
knows
the
-
the
holding
in
the
american
chain
and
cable
case
in
a
well
reason
opinion
by
judge
parker
is
that
even
though
the
commission
deny
a
petition
to
reopen
and
modify
an
order
that
the
court
of
appeals
may
review
such
action
and
may
on
its
own
motion
and
of
its
own
accord
reopen
and
modify
an
order
of
the
commission
if
it
feels
that
such
is
justified
by
the
change
of
fact
are
circumstances
existing
at
that
time
and
the
commission
--
this
a
meeting
of
this
particular
paragraph
in
the
commission's
reasoned
opinion
in
this
case.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
that
order
sir
was
a
--
involved
a
standard
conspiracy
order
requiring
the
respondents
to
cease
and
desist
form
conspiring
or
agreeing
to
do
and
perform
the
illegal
acts
and
practices.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
as
were
order
would
--
of
course
we
concede
to
go
beyond
this
main
order
but
in
the
context
of
this
case,
the
commission
feels
that
it
is
reasonable
and
necessary
that
such
an
order
be
issued
that
the
order
bars
a
rational
connection
to
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
and
that
is
--
is
exercising
its
allowable
judgment
in
issuing
the
order
in
the
form
that
it
has
issued.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
no,
sir.
if
it
means
that
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
that
would
depend
sir
upon
the
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
if
they're
doing
it
pursuant
to
a
zone
delivered
pricing
system,
i
believe
that
that
would
constitute
a
violation
of
the
commission's
order.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
the
--
the
price
is
uniform
in
every
point
within
a
given
geographic
zone.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
there
may
be
circumstances
under
which
other
competitors
could
impart
match
the
zone
delivered
pricing
of
their
competitors
and
not
violate
the
order
but
if
they
exactly
matched
his
zone
delivered
pricing
system
nationwide
so
that
there
existed
a
system
to
that
effect
and
with
the
purpose
and
effect
of
exactly
matching
prices
then
such
would
constitute
in
my
judgment,
sir,
a
violation
of
this
order
but
there
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
no,
sir.
and
they
might
well
divides
a
system
where
there
might
be
concentric
zones
based
upon
common
production
points
where
they
would
find
it
necessary
to
exactly
match
price
in
their
competitors
in
order
to
meet
competition.
but
in
this
instance,
if
they
did
that
nationwide
and
with
the
disparity
of
production
points,
such
would
constitute
a
violation
with
the
order.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
oh
yes
sir
and
not
in
--
not
in
the
federal
trade
commission
act
but
of
course
that's
implicit
and
is
provided
under
section
2
(b)
of
the
manipulating
act.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i
think
so
sir.
that
is
my
judgment.
that
is
a
remedy
or
that
is
the
defense
why
under
the
law
and
the
commission
must
pay
proper
deference
in
honor
to
it.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
if
you
do
it
systematically
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
--
and
according
to
a
zone
delivered
pricing
system,
the
--
the
order
seeks
to
force
the
respondents
to
advice
their
own
individual
pricing
system
which
will
not
result
in
systematically
matching
prices
through
the
type
system
that
the
commission
found
in
the
order
and
which
he
found
to
be
as
used
by
the
respondents'
illegal.
respondents
have
a
wide
variety
of
pricing
methods
which
they
could
use,
indeed,
they
could
go
back
to
the
methods
which
they
use
prior
to
the
inception
of
this
conspiracy.
methods
that
were
disparate
that
were
based
upon
a
wide
variety
of
ever
changing
points
of
free
delivery
and
equalization.
to
that,
they
could
return
or
the
factors
you
have
remaining
one
disappeared
during
this
litigation,
but
there
are
remaining
in
the
industry
for
factors
now
for
principle
factors,
eagle-picher,
national,
sherwin-williams
and
glidden.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
giving
you
a
frank
answer
to
that,
your
honor
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
--
we
find
it
difficult
to
enforce
orders
in
some
instances
of
this
character.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
it
has
--
it
has
grown
in
part
out
all
the
commission's
practical
experience
over
the
years
in
the
enforcement
of
these
conspiracy
--
price
fixing
conspiracy
orders
and
in
part,
in
large
part
from
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
and
it
is
primarily
upon
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
that
the
commission
seeks
this
remedy.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
it
is
sir
difficult.
the
respondents'
say
in
their
brief
that
they
want
the
right
to
use
and
if
they
wish
a
zone
delivered
price
which
will
substantially
vary
from
the
instant
price,
well
that's
another
law
suit,
another
piece
of
litigation
and
this
lasting
over
a
period
of
12
years
is
early
extensive.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
in
part
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
no,
sir.
i
think
in
part
it
was
attributed
--
may
be
attributed
to
the
fact
that
hearings
were
suspended
because
the
respondents
indicated
to
the
commission
that
they
were
engaged
in
more
effort
and
that
trial
of
the
matter
at
that
point
would
hamper
their
efficiency
in
engagement
to
more
effort.
but
it
--
this
is
a
--
also
a
complex
case
and
involves
an
entire
industry.
it
was
indeed
a
complex
pricing
structure
that
they
evolved
and
to
show
the
facets
--
facets
of
it
in
old
price.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
a
system
was
effectuated
in
--
in
late
1933
and
1934,
the
commission's
compliant
was
issued
in
1944,
the
amended
complaint
in
1946.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
the
record
would
not
show
that
of
course,
these
matters
must
necessarily
be
investigated
sometimes
extensively
and
sometimes
over
a
period
of
time.
that's
our
experience
with
the
commission
and
with
regard
to
industry
wide
price
fixing
cases.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
yes
sir,
to
prevent
unfair
methods
of
competition
and
it
is
precisely
that
that
the
commission
seeks
in
this
order
to
prevent
a
continuation
of
this
practice.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
in
1953.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
hearings
were
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i
--
as
i
recall
the
hearings,
it
was
taken
the
testimony
were
completed
in
1948.
they
were
interlocutory
matters
rise
in
the
meantime
and
the
commission
had
it
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
that
is
right
sir.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i'm
reluctant
to
speak
of
that
point
because
it
isn't
covered
in
the
record.
i
--
i
merely
want
it
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i
merely
wanted
to
indicate
that
the
commission
necessarily
in
--
in
issuing
these
orders,
considers
its
experience
in
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
--
other
matters,
similar
matters.
i
might
indicate
that
there
have
been
only,
as
i
recall,
two
successful
actions
filed
in
the
courts
or
enforcement
of
federal
trade
commission
cases
in
price
fixing
conspiracies.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
or
violations
of
the
order
--
it's
a
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
no.
it
could
prove
that
the
respondents
across
the
boards
were
uniformly
desires
of
confirming
the
law
and
did
so.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
may
i
simply
indicate
that
the
commission
necessarily
determines
the
remedy,
not
only
according
to
facts
and
case
what
is
reasonable
and
necessary
according
to
those
facts
but
on
the
basis
of
its
expert
experience
in
the
drafting
of
orders
and
handling
of
similar
cases.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i
would
choose
to
--
bottom
our
case
upon
the
facts
of
this
particular
case.
i
--
i
think
in
all
fairness,
i
can
only
do
that
sir.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
there
were
meeting,
sir,
at
that
time
but
this
was
not
part
of
the
code
provisions.
they
were
meeting
together
for
the
purpose
of
formulating
a
code
and
they
--
because
we
--
because
the
commission
found
in
the
court,
sustained
the
commission
in
this
---
as
part
of
those
meetings,
they
effectuated
a
price
fixing
conspiracy
and
agreement
in
the
industry.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
well,
the
code
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
no
sir,
i
think
you
read
it
that
--
would
correctly
read
it
that
these
respondents
on
the
advice
of
counsel
were
apprehensive,
that
any
price
fixing
agreement
of
the
character,
providing
for
uniform
basis
of
sale
would
violate
the
existing
antitrust
laws.
they
were
in
my
judgment
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
yes
sir
and
i
may
even
have
been
leery
of
the
constitutionality
of
nra.
but
in
any
event,
they
never
had
inserted
in
the
code,
the
zone
delivered
pricing
system.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
yes,
sir.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
only
in
part.
there
--
is
on
the
record,
a
great
deal
of
correspondence
and
testimony
from
which
the
commission
included.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i
would
consider
an
important
part,
i
do
so,
and
the
commission
did.
we
have
emphasized
that
in
our
briefs
below,
but
it
was,
by
no
means,
the
only
part
of
the
evidence
which
indicated
about
the
conspiracy.
there
was
a,
in
this
instance,
a
record
of
about
five
thousand
pages
and
much
correspondence
and
much
testimony
adduced
on
the
price
fixing
agreement.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
yes,
sir,
it
is.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
commission
has
not
said
that
it
would
be
too
difficult.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
it
--
it
certainly
is
a
correct
reflection
of
some
of
the
thinking
expressed
in
this
opinion.
the
commission
believes
that
and
has
said
that
it
believes
that
the
--
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
the
pricing
pattern
in
this
industry
be
effectively
broken
so
as
to
once
again
bring
a
measure
of
competition
into
the
industry.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
in
the
context
of
this
case,
i
--
i
think
that
will
be
most
difficult,
your
honor.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
our
test
before
this
court,
your
honor,
in
that
instance
would
be
infinitely
greater
and
it
is,
as
i
stand
here
today,
with
these
findings
and
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
the
momentum
of
the
system
as
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
yes,
sir.
and
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
that
states
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
that
state
necessary
more
precisely.
the
commission
in
the
exercise
of
its
expert
judgment
as
a
finder
of
the
facts
and
as
this
court
has
often
held
as
a
--
as
a
framer
of
the
remedy
has
used
its
allowable
judgment
in
framing
this
cease
and
desist
order
for
the
purposes
i
have
stated.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
yes,
sir
and
it
is
important
that
this
is
a
system
once
devised
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
--
which
is
very
simple
in
its
operation,
much
more
simple
to
operate
than
would
be
a
multiple
basing
point
system,
for
instance.
and
it
is
because
of
this
simplicity
of
operation.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
well,
i
don't
have
to
quarrel
with
you
of
that
at
this
point
on
--
on
that
matter
in
order
to
make
the
point
i
just
made
sir.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i
think
sir
that
absent
the
overt
acts
that
you
have
mentioned
but
only
a
slight
variation
in
the
--
in
their
--
in
their
system
individually
that
the
substantially
--
the
same
pricing
structure
could
and
would
exist.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
because
of
the
momentum
of
what
has
been
done
over
a
quarter
of
century
and
because
of
the
very
simplicity
of
this
--
of
this
--
of
zone
delivered
pricing
system.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i
could
come
in
sir,
six
months
from
now
and
make
a
showing
that
there
is
no
longer
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
no
sir,
but
it
is
implicit
in
the
statute.
they
may
come
in
at
any
time
and
show
change,
circumstances
of
fact
or
changed
law
or
merely
that
the
public
interest
no
longer
requires
that
order
stand.
and
the
commission
must
hear
them
out,
may
in
appropriate
instances
require
to
take
in
testimony
and
that
is
reviewable
by
a
court
of
appeals.
and
whatever
action
the
commission
takes,
whether
denial
or
petition
modify
or
the
modification
itself
is
reviewable
by
a
court
of
appeals
which
may
itself
in
an
order
finding
--
a
finding
that
the
--
this
portion
of
the
order
is
no
longer
necessary
and
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
it
is
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
the
statute
--
the
statute
says
sir
that
the
commission
may
modify
or
vacate
its
orders
upon
a
showing
of
--
upon
a
finding
of
changed
circumstances,
in
fact
of
law
and
if
the
commission
feels
that
the
public
interest
so
demands
and
the
--
the
opinion
in
the
american
chain
and
cable
case
holds
very
precisely
that
not
only
the
propriety
of
any
modification
may
be
subject
to
court's
review
but
if
the
--
the
denial
of
a
modification
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
may
itself
feels
so
inclined.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
no,
sir.
that's
implicit
in
the
statute
and
--
and
implicit
in
the
law
as
found
in
the
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
--
in
the
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
--
chain
and
cable
case.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
in
a
very
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
the
chain
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
chain
and
cable
case,
the
decision,
a
well
reasoned
decision
in
that
case
deals
with
this
point
in
--
extensibly.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
we
do
have
occasionally
such
an
application.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
oh,
i
--
i
would
judge
on
the
order
of
five
or
six
such
applications
a
year.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
it
was
not
necessarily
so
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
it's
not
a
--
an
homogenous
product
because
there
is
a
matter
of
brands
which
enter
in
as
you
note
from
my
argument
that
some
of
the
products
were
sold
in
carload,
some
in
less
than
carload
and
--
and
that
is
applying
to
the
lead
oxides
which
are
quite
heavy
but
the
lead
and
oil
is
sold
in
case
of
varying
sizes.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
it
--
it
is
sir.
there
--
there
was
competition
in
this
industry
prior
to
1933
and
the
product.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
there
is
indication
in
the
record
that
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
that
there
--
there
is
a
difference
in
quality
of
the
products
in
many
instances
particularly
in
the
products
used
in
manufacturing
batteries,
for
instance,
some
better
manufactures.
the
finding
indicates
--
tends
to
stay
with
the
producer
of
whose
products
he
is
set
up
to
use.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
turning
to
the
matter
of
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
--
has
mentioned,
it's
a
position
of
the
commission
that
the
purpose
of
this
order
is
to
prevent
each
respondent
from
using
this
own
delivered
pricing
system
in
order
to
systematically
match
the
prices
of
their
competitors.
the
commission,
of
course,
conceives
the
right
of
each
of
these
respondents
to
individually
devise
its
own
pricing
system.
it
doesn't
--
it's
not
concerned
of
what
type
of
pricing
system
is
devised
by
this
respondents.
and
frankly,
we
feel
that
it
is
unlikely
that
the
respondents
could,
in
the
immediate
future,
continue
using
a
zone
delivered
pricing
system.
we
--
we
believe
that
it's
possible
that
they
might
devise
individually
a
system
which
would
not
constitute
a
systematic
matching
of
the
prices,
but
we
can
--
we
--
we
believe
that
it
is
well
not
impossible
to
do
so
and
that
they
must
turn.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
yes
sir
that
there,
they
had
devised
this
system
and
we'e
using
it
for
the
purpose
and
with
the
effect
of
systematically
matching
prices
and
thus
depriving
the
public
of
price
competition.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
well,
they
are
certainly
not
prevented
from
going
back,
returning
to
--
to
methods
of
pricing
which
existed
in
the
industry
prior
to
1933
where
national
had
589
different
pricing
points
in
40
states
which
should
have
varied
from
time
to
time
and
where
eagle-picher
had
a
somewhat
similar
but
different
pricing
system.
and
where
there
where
differing
conditions
and
on
terms
of
sale,
and
where
for
example
the
white
lead
and
some
instances
was
tied
to
the
price
of
pigment
lead
which
is
not
the
case
here.
here,
the
lead
oxides
are
--
have
been
tied
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
that
--
that
is
somewhat
difficult
for
me
to
answer,
if
they
have
--
if
--
if
two
of
the
respondents
have
--
have
a
common
production
point,
i
think
it's
--
it's
likely
that
there
would
be
a
tendency
that
for
sameness
in
price.
but
quality
and
brand
names
in
or
into
the
problem
of
pricing
here,
customer
preference,
the
record
shows
that
national's
dutch
boy
brand
is
--
is
more
(inaudible)
any
other
brand
that
no
one
in
the
industry
in
the
matter
of
consumer
preference,
there
are
many
ways
in
which
these
respondents
may
compete
and
it
is
important
sir,
the
fact
that
there
are
only
now
about
four
factors
in
the
entire
industry.
and
that
is
important
in
--
in
the
context
of
this
whole
situation.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
we'd
be
very
glad
to
do
that.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
if
that
is
his
understanding
of
my
statement
to
this
court,
he
is
in
error
and
i
was
an
error
in
making
the
statement
if
i
may
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
what
the
--
what
the
commission
has
sought
to
prevent
here
is
a
continuation
of
a
systematic
matching
of
prices
by
zone
delivered
pricing
system.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
well,
of
course,
various
factors
that
were
entered
in
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
but,
if
they
--
if
they
did
--
if
they
arrive
at
that
common
pricing
through
individual
acts,
completely
innocently
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
and
no
anti-competitive
effects.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
that
that
would
be
a
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
competitive
effects,
no
anti-competitive
effects.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
you
would
--
i
was
thinking
in
terms
of
the
clayton
act
becauser
there
are
other
statutes
that
have
to
be
considered
in
any
one
of
these
problems
but
as
you
pose
the
question,
i
--
i
see
no
illegality.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
you
had
a
particular
price
of
the
way
to
a
particular
customer
on
a
state
boundary
line
and
a
different
price
to
the
customer
just
beyond
the
state
boundary
line.
it
might
be
price
discrimination.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
no
sir.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
that
is
right
sir.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
yes
sir,
it
is.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
as
i
under
--
the
--
the
provision
itself
does
not
say
so
in
many
words
--
in
so
many
words
but
i
think
that
if
its
basis
is
that
the
respondents
shall
individually
develop
their
own
pricing
system
and
that
if
they
use
a
zone
delivered
pricing
system,
it
must
not
be
with
the
purpose
and
effect
of
systematically
matching
one
and
others
prices
and
there,
if
i
understand
it
was
what
you
were
referring
to
--
do
in
your
example.
innocent
--
innocent
behavior
individually
arrived
that
and
i
would
be
compelled
to
say
that
always
where
the
respondents
have
innocently
and
individually
arrived
at
their
own
pricing
system
that
that
must
necessarily
--
it
must
necessarily
follow
that
the
action
is
legal.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
sir,
you
have
injected
another
proposition.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
you
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
you
--
you
inject
a
--
a
factor
of
knowledge
and
--
and
what
are
not
the
one
manufacturer
has
with
that
knowledge
adopted
the
pricing
practices
of
another
for
the
purpose
of
matching
prices
which
gets
pretty
close
to
what
the
little
triangle
avoid
here
in
this
--
in
the
use
of
--
continued
use
of
his
own
delivered
pricing
system.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
it
would
be
--
he
would
be
rather
unsafe
for
him
to
do
so.
he'd
better
think
about
his
own
pricing
practices
and
devise
a
system
it's
lightly
different
from
what
he's
got
today.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i
would
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i
--
i
would
concede
sir
that
there
and
it
might
be
circumstance
that
there
might
be
instance
as
many
--
where
prices
of
competitors
might
be
matched
in
the
future
in
this
industry.
that
was
true
prior
to
1933.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
no
sir,
i
--
i
wouldn't
recommend
the
adoption
of
any
particular
pricing
method.
what
the
commission
has
sought
to
do
is
to
american
industry
free
to
adopt
individually
pricing
methods
and
not
to
prohibit
such
methods
as
such,
that's
why
the
charge
wasn't
made
in
the
complaint,
but
it's
only
in
the
context
of
a
price
fixing
conspiracy
as
hearing
that
the
commission
feels
that
it
mustn't
have
proscribed
such
methods
when
done
for
the
purpose
of
systematically
matching
prices.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
not
necessarily,
it
--
it
may
be
wholly
justified
by
the
leading
competition
advanced
in
the
clayton
act.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
and
if
it's
not
part
of
a
--
of
a
system
throughout
matching
prices
but
is
done
for
the
purpose
of
meeting
the
individual
competitive
situation,
and
assuming
the
--
that
that
--
that
the
section
2
(b)
of
the
clayton
act
would
be
applicable
here
that
the
factual
situation
would
be
such
as
to
constitute
a
defense
there
then
i
would
have
to
concede
that
that
would
be
a
lawful
situation.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
that
is
true.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
you
--
you
can
get
in
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
well,
you
--
you
get
into
a
situation
involving
2
(b)
of
the
clayton
act
of
where
the
action
could
be
completed
defensively
in
meeting
the
prices.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
whatever
--
i
would
say
this
that
whatever
the
prices,
whether
high
or
low,
if
the
parties
operated
for
the
purpose
of
matching
prices
and
depriving
the
consuming
public
of
price
competition
in
the
industry
as
was
the
case
here,
then
that
is
illegal.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i
don't
believe
you
would
in
that
--
just
for
the
act
of
lowering
prices
but
if
--
if
you
have
adopted
a
--
a
system
for
exactly
matching
prices
where
some
have
to
lower
and
some
have
to
raise
as
was
the
instance
here
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
only
lowering.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
well,
that
is
the
--
that
is
the
result
(inaudible)
to
be
desired
in
the
comparative
economy,
lower
--
lower
prices
but
it
isn't
the
way
these
price
fixing
conspiracies
usually
operate.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
from
lowering
prices,
no
sir.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i
don't
agree
that
he
would
be
--
his
company
would
be
prevented
from
lowering
prices
or,
in
all
instances,
from
meeting
competition.
i
think
they'd
have
that
right.
but
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
--
they
would
be
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
--
prevented
from
using
the
zone
delivered
pricing
system
in
order
to
systematically
match
their
competitor's
prices.
that
is
all
that
we
have
maintained.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
well,
i
think
it
should
well
be
nationwide
or
it
could
well
be
within
a
zone
or
an
area.
it
would
depend
upon
the
circumstances.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
again,
it
would
depend
upon
the
artificial
nature
of
the
area,
size,
all
the
circumstances.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i'm
very
happy
to
do
so,
your
honor.
