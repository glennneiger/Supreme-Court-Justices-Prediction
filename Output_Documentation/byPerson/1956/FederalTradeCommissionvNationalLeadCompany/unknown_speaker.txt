unknown
speaker
does
--
does
this
provision
keep
the
individual
lead
producer
from
using
the
zone
pricing
system?
unknown
speaker
but
you
--
you
haven't
directed
this
issue
at
hand.
unknown
speaker
and
if
they
want
to
add
on
so
much
for
each
zone
provided
that
would
not
violate?
unknown
speaker
if
the
result
is
a
matching
of
prices,
can
you
say
they
violate
the
order,
they
brought
us
a
purposes
if
that
is.
unknown
speaker
where
--
where
is
--
where
are
biggest
of
these
companies
located?
where
is
the
national
located?
do
they
have
several
factories?
unknown
speaker
but
take
--
take
national
with
four
or
five
or
ten
or
twelve
production
points,
does
it
always
make
the
same
price
the
cincinnati,
ohio?
unknown
speaker
well,
just
acting
for
itself,
it
can
do
that.
it
doesn't
publish
price
list?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
but
--
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
is
that
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
the
charge
in
the
order
recognized
serious
ambiguities
(inaudible)
by
the
conspiracy.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
did
you
mean
(voice
overlap)
--
excuse
me,
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
does
it
mean
to
any
--
any
particular
point
that
there
must
be
differing
prices
for
pigments?
unknown
speaker
if
--
if
national
sells
its
little
of
what
the
prices
are
but
if
it
sells
and
excess
profound,
then
all
the
others
can
sell
at
that
locality
of
the
same
price?
unknown
speaker
they
don't
make
any
conspiracy,
they
just
find
out
what
national's
selling
for
and
they
say,
we'll
sell
this
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
the
zone
delivered
pricing
system,
that
from
the
factory
there
should
be
a
zone
price
that
goes
to
everybody
from
united
states.
unknown
speaker
no,
i'm
speaking
of
the
one
manufacture.
the
one
manufacture
makes
a
price
--
unknown
speaker
and
he
--
he
charges
their
three
zones
and
all
these
zones
left
basis
out
in
xx
plus
one
and
x
plus
two.
now,
can
anybody
else
match
that
under
your
--
unknown
speaker
you
had
admissive
--
you
had
admissive
point
system
and
each
person
used
their
own
production
point
as
the
basic
point
in
objection
to
that.
unknown
speaker
there's
no
(inaudible)
on
the
ground
that
meet
competition
in
your
act,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
what
is
--
was
this
about
the
meaning
of
competition?
unknown
speaker
would
--
to
the
(inaudible)
or
would
the
effect
of
systematically
matching
the
delivered
price
of
quotation?delivered
prices
of
other
sellers
with
lead
pigments,
and
thereby
permitting
purchaser
in
finding
any
advantage
in
price
dealing
with
one
or
more
sellers.
so
whenever
they
--
they
match
prices,
i
don't
just
understand,
if
you
match
prices
then
you
violate
the
ordinance?
unknown
speaker
you
do
it
because
you
want
the
business
(voice
overlap)
cause
of
conspiracy.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
but
it
would
not
have
the
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
the
reason
i
asked
that
is
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
well,
i
noticed
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
is
--
is
this
the
type
of
commodity
that
has
a
natural
monopoly
in
the
area
around
it
like
a
cement
production
of
that
--
unknown
speaker
is
it
a
high
cost
commodity
that
carry
the
--
carry
the
transportation
cost
having
the
difficulty
or
--
or
is
it
a
--
a
heavy
weight
low
--
low
value
commodity
like
cement
that
has
a
natural
monopoly
around
every
factory.
unknown
speaker
so
if
it's
really
a
competitive
--
unknown
speaker
but
if
i
want
--
buy
it
from
national
lead,
i
get
a
different
product
if
were
to
buy
--
buy
it
from
dutch
boy
or
(inaudible)
or
some
other
--
unknown
speaker
unlike
sugar,
cement
--
unknown
speaker
you
say
there
--
there
is
one
white
lead
zone,
everything
east
of
the
rocky
mountains?
unknown
speaker
everything
is
east
to
the
rocky
mountains?
unknown
speaker
every
--
every
producers
sold
lead
at
the
same
price
throughout
that
area?
unknown
speaker
but
--
but
for
any
one
day,
the
price
was
the
same
from
main
to
utah?
unknown
speaker
and
there's
enough
profit
margin
for
--
so
far
away
for
companies
to
absorb
that.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
suppose
there
was
a
finding
of
that
kind,
would
there
be
any
difference
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
--
do
you
agree
with
what
the
court
said
below,
as
i
understand
it,
that
here,
there
was
no
finding
of
the
--
unknown
speaker
no
charge
and
no
finding.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
kintner,
let's
just
take
the
simple
illustration
of
single
state,
all
three
of
these
respondents,
completely
independently
upon
--
happened
they
hit
upon
the
boundaries
of
the
single
state
as
a
zone
and
also
completely
independently
although
they
happen
to
hit
upon
the
identical
price
for
a
given
products
sold
within
that
zone.
that
was
a
fact
situation
left
with
bigger
position
as
to
the
effects
of
this
decree.
unknown
speaker
but
it
just
doesn't
consider
no
factors
except
by
the
--
unknown
speaker
--
that's
--
that's
the
high
cost.
that's
the
high
cost.
unknown
speaker
that's
the
high
cost,
the
one
--
the
one
that
plans
that
--
unknown
speaker
what's
that?
unknown
speaker
well
--
we
--
you
have
to
be
reasonably
practical
about
the
--
what
--
what's
the
manufacturer
going
do
when
he
looks
at
the
(inaudible)
--
unknown
speaker
--
give
it
to
one
man
or
--
or
in
his
price?
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
easy
to
devise
a
system
that's
different
from
what
your
competitors
devises
but
how
you
can
devise
a
system
that
will
serve
your
lead
at
a
higher
price
to
your
competitor.
unknown
speaker
but
your
competitor
can
sell
at
a
higher
price
than
you
looks
different
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn't
recommend
the
production
cost
plus
transportation
for
everyone?
unknown
speaker
systematic
and
matched
where?
nationwide,
zone
wide,
(voice
overlap)
--
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it's
in
a
zone
or
an
area
then
--
then
you
--
you
--
you'll
say
that
if
you
can
lower
your
price
to
beat
your
competitor's
price.
