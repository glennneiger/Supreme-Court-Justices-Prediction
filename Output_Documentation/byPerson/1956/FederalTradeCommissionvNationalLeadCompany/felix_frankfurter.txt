justice
felix
frankfurter
what
does
that
mean?
it's
--
it's
difficult
to
establish
(inaudible)
practice
and
definitely
strike
down
the
individual's
rate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
litigation
last
that
long?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
anti-trust
litigation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
--
when
did
the
commission
begin
to
proceed
after
they
did
--
after
they
pursued
or
(inaudible)
how
long
was
the
system
in
effect
before
the
commission
had
underway?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
know
if
--
if
the
record
show
on
the
commission
came
aware
of
the
gist
of
the
fact?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
whole
theory
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act
was
to
let
these
things
in
the
bottom
get
on
their
way
before
they
reestablish.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
when
--
the
decree,
is
it?
when
did
they
petition
the
order?
justice
felix
frankfurter
1953.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
if
you
got
in
the
way
in
1944,
there's
not
much
left
in
the
war,
that
was
only
a
year,
how
long
was
it
40.26
after
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
was
completed
in
1948
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
an
order
amended
in
1953.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
(inaudible)
what
was
the
experience
to
which
you
refer
that
you
--
it's
indicated
--
the
experience
the
petitioner
had
and
this
company
or
is
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
you
had
to
have
this
(inaudible)
commission
in
order
to
carry
out
the
main
conclusion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
indicate
the
kinds
of
things
of
what
the
commission
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
other
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
violated
therefore
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
statute,
they
were
not
successful
doesn't
prove
either
that
there
were
violations.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
know
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
justice
minton's
question
sought
to
elicit
that
experience
and
you
say
that
we
just
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
kintner,
is
the
--
is
it
fair
to
put
the
essence
of
the
commission
in
this
case
in
terms
of
something
like
this
that
the
momentum
of
the
past
conspiracies
as
to
the
condemnation
of
which
is
not
to
challenge,
that
the
momentum
of
that
collaborative
activist
is
so
powerful
that
if
each
individually
had
a
price
owning
--
price
owning
system,
the
difficulty
of
discovering
this,
it
is
by
collaboration
by
contrary
is
too
great
not
to
permit,
striking
down
individuals
over.
is
that
the
essence
of
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
as
--
as
an
evidentiary
matter,
it
would
be
too
difficult
to
establish,
it's
--
it's
an
unfair
burden
to
cast
upon
the
government
as
a
matter
of
practical
experience,
it
would
be
too
difficult
to
establish
concert
than
normally
their
individual
actions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
not
at
the
heart
of
business
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
have
not
a
prior
establishment
of
the
conspiracy,
you
wouldn't
possibly
defend
such
a
provision,
could
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
supposing
it
wasn't
--
suppose
that
the
--
the
commission
wasn't
maintaining
as
it
had
a
knowledge
(inaudible)
that
what
seems
to
be
individual
action
if
their
guides
still
(inaudible)
that
they
must
be
in
concert.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
because
you
haven't
established
it.
the
theory
is
likely
to
continue
by
the
sheer
force
of
inertia.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
--
that's
the
case,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
rather
perhaps
the
more
narrowly
that
it's
an
allowable
judgment
for
the
commission
to
so
believe
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
there
pursuant
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
multiple
basing
point
system
is
bad
in
itself.
so
i
don't
think
that
helps
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
suppose
--
suppose
you
are
in
the
position
as
you
are
now,
to
say
to
the
court,
suppose
the
commission
made
the
opinion
which
said,
we
are
only
confident.
we
have
no
doubt
that
these
individual
conspirators
will
--
will
--
with
fastidious
scrupulosity,
not
under
into
any
talks,
settlement,
agreement,
they
won't
(inaudible),
et
cetera.
and
yet,
by
a
sheer
force
of
the
past,
the
future
is
bound
to
remain
to
say,
would
--
could
you
take
such
a
position?
if
you
really
disavow
any
--
i
don't
mean
conscious
evasion
but
any
kind
of
interplay
between,
would
you
still
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
this
system
automatically
is
bound
to
go
on
because
of
the
--
the
force
of
--
or
left
loose
by
the
conspiracy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
appears
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
a
purging
period
at
all?
because
they
come
in
and
four
years
from
now
and
say
we
are
now
--
the
momentum
has
been
--
has
been
interrupted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there's
no
such
escalated
loss
in
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
specifically
provided
in
the
statute?
i
don't
mean
generally
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
the
general
judicial
reviews
which
--
the
statutes.
its
--
there
isn't
any
specific
judicial
review
hitched
on
to
this
modification.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
for
myself
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
the
various
discretion
modifying
and
otherwise
that
is
the
order,
it
should
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
mr.
du
bose,
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
you
opened
your
argument,
that's
--
as
my
theory
would
obtain
continuously
that
either
mr.
kintner
in
his
argument
gave
in
scope
to
the
--
to
be
contested,
the
feature
of
the
decree
of
the
order
different
from
what
you
had
assumed
it
to
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
trying
to
be
dealing
that
--
so
that
one
can
understand
whether
there
is
and
in
--
to
what
extent
there
is
a
disagreement
between
you
and
the
commission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
this
is
a
serious
business,
this
is
a
decree
--
this
is
an
order
which
subjects
you
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
a
great
deal
of
mr.
kintner's,
even
would
be
good
enough
to
--
supposedly
when
it
comes
to
respond,
are
we
to
agree
or
disagree
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
suppose
--
suppose
that
the
commission
wants
to
put
in
form
--
in
formal
terms
what
you
understand
of
mr.
kitner's
interpretation,
what
effect
if
any
would
that
have
upon
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
collusion
is
out.
we
are
--
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
controversy
from
what
i
understand
your
argument
to
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
they
had
a
right
to
--
to
prohibit
as
tightly
as
they
pleased,
collusion
as
such.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
objected,
as
i
had
--
opened
as
your
argument
is
that
independent
action
in
and
out
itself
cannot
be
deemed
to
be
a
way
of
remedy
entire
collusion
on
the
theory
that
it
didn't
have
to
operate
collusiveness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
subject
of
your
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
to
be
unfair
to
those
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
heart
of
it.
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is
if
they
correspond
as
they
have
from
--
the
--
what
--
the
way
you
read
that
order,
to
what
extent
does
that
qualify
to
(inaudible)
you
may
still
lead
you
to
object
as
i
infer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
wouldn't
have
to
qualify
the
scope
of
your
objection
and
distinction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
what
becomes
important
when
you
(inaudible)
what
order
we
are
asked
to
support
as
against
what
the
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
just
want
to
know
your
understanding
whether
it
precipitates
the
apparent
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
doesn't
justify
to
try
--
as
vindicating
a
charge
just
to
justify
as
a
mode
of
enforcing
the
charge
which
has
been
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
argument
before
the
commission
entered
the
term
of
the
order
regarding
the
scope
of
the
order?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
before
the
litigation,
a
proposed
order
to
which
you
spoke.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
you
had
--
did
that
include
the
--
the
contested
clause?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
was
not
--
this
wasn't
--
the
order
of
the
commission
wasn't
by
way
of
the
proposed
decree
for
the
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
the
court
asking
counsel
to
address
themselves
in
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
proposed
decree.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
mean
--
does
that
mean
that
if
they
--
let's
say
they
were
required
to
do
so
that
you
would
have
to
establish
in
order
to
drag
them
up
to
determine
the
disobedience
of
the
order
and
that
(inaudible)
that
the
burden
would
be
on
that
they
have
--
they
have
systematically
tried
from
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
would
you
state
negatively
what
they
are
not
prevented
from
doing
by
this
order.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
could
they
do
(inaudible)
not
to
offend
your
view
of
the
order,
and
he
thinks
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
kintner,
may
i
ask
you
what
chief
justice's
concurrence,
if
you
will
be
good
enough
to
look
at
your
brief
and
see
if
you
want
to
add
anything
by
way
of
a
memorandum
to
the
court
on
what
you
conceive
to
be,
the
--
the
requirements
of
this
contested
provision.
i'm
not
asking
to
apply
that
in
memorandum
but
look
at
your
brief
and
see
whether
you
have
said
everything
you
want
to
say
in
view
of
mr.
du
bose's
understanding,
whether
you
want
to
add
anything
(inaudible)
order
does
or
doesn't
do.
and
i
suggest
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
the
commission
that
make
--
makes
the
orders
did
not
even
sometimes
say
what
--
what
an
order
doesn't
forbid.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
have
covered
that
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
hear
what
you
said,
no
anti?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
could
there
be
an
ant-competitive
effects
it
you
--
assuming
the
situation
(inaudible)
what
--
when
can
you
draw
the
basis
of
finding
that
anti-competitive
effects?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
discrimination
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
not
because
of
the
decree
--
to
competitive
independently
as
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
did
the
same
thing
but
it
wouldn't
have
to
regard
to
competitors
if
i
consider
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
a
different
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
--
what
you're
saying,
what
you've
just
said
if
i
understand
you
is
that
in
due
of
the
past
prices
condemn
that
conspiratorial
--
you
can't
put
it
the
way
your
competitor
does.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
what
--
what
this
decree
cover.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
more
i
agree
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
kintner,
i
hope
i'm
not
alone
in
wishing
in
light
of
the
discussion
that
we
had
and
taking
that
it's
important
to
get
in
more
detail
that
the
clearer
indication
--
definition
was
taken
of
what
the
scope
of
this
to
create
and
i
think
(inaudible)
in
the
light
of
this
--
of
the
arguments
been
exchanged
between
counsels
in
the
bench.
