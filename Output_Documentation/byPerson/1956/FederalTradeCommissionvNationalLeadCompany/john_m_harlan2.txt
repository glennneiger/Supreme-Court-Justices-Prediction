justice
john
m.
harlan
is
the
crucial
part
of
the
order
in
issue
here
what
you've
got
quoted
at
page
6
of
your
brief?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
it
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
striking
down
this
section
go
simply
on
the
question
of
power
of
the
commission
to
do
this
or
did
it
go
on
to
say
that
even
assuming
there
was
power,
this
was
beyond
the
scope
of
proper
discretionary
relief?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
the
order
had
been
limited
to
conspiring
agreement
to
do
these
things.
now,
would
have
been
all
right
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
but
it
couldn't
--
the
commission
had
no
power
under
its
complaint
and
under
the
act
to
prescribe
these
individual
acts,
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
pardon
me.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
one
question
before
you
sit
down.
did
i
take
it
from
your
argument
you're
saying
that
the
powers
of
the
federal
trade
commission
in
this
respect
to
a
narrow
than
the
powers
of
a
core
down
to
the
antitrust
laws
that
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
i'm
going
to
ask
you.
even
--
even
if
this
were
a
sherman
act
proceeding
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
you
--
you
would
say
and
the
complain
have
been
the
same
that
this
would
not
--
wouldn't
not
been
able
that
they
allow
the
judgment
in
passing
of
the
decree
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
since
you're
going
enlighten
this
further
on
the
scope
of
this
provision,
i'd
like
to
add
one
more
question
to
it.
take
a
simple
case
within
a
zone
where
one
person
--
one
company
is
selling
at
x
dollars
and
another
company
wants
to
come
down
to
meet
that
price.
he
does
it
consciously,
deliberately
for
that
purpose.
you
say
that's
prohibited
by
this
decree?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
isn't
that
you
(inaudible)
do
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
whatever
your
motive
was,
how
does
that
run
afoul
the
provision,
in
your
decree
it
says
thereby
preventing
matching
prices,
thereby
preventing
purchases
from
finding
any
advantage
in
price
in
dealing
with
one
or
more
sellers
as
against
another.
i
had
read
that
merely
to
mean
that
they
--
you
weren't
to
match
prices
by
raising
it,
because
i
don't
understand
how
you
can
effect
the
competitive
situation,
vis-Ã -vis
the
public
by
reducing
prices
because
the
public
then
has
two
instead
of
one
person
--
one
--
one
company
to
deal
with
in
the
lower
prices.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you
don't
construe
it
that
way.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
don't
construe
it
that
way
though,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
this
is
independent
form
the
clayton
act.
this
is
--
i'm
talking
about
the
terms
of
the
decree.
mr.
du
bose
said
what
--
that
even
in
that
situation,
his
company
could
not
match
prices.
and
now,
i
understand
you
agree
with
that
interpretation.
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
are
we
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
excuse
me.
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
are
you
depriving
the
public
in
the
competition
in
prices
when
you
lower
your
own
prices
to
meet
a
competitive
price?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
talking
about
lowering
only.
i
want
to
know
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
catches
the
lowering
as
well
as
the
raising
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
but
mr.
du
bose
says
that
under
your
decree
as
written,
this
company
would
be
preventive
from
achieving
what
you
now
says
that
that
was
however
the
result.
now,
do
you
agree
with
that
or
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
don't.
