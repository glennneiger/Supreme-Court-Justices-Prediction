what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
attacking
the
statute.
you're
--
this
is
not
a
case
of
--
this
is
not
a
suggestion,
it
is
pertinency
discrimination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
state
--
statute,
attack
on
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
is
involved
in
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
it
was.
when
you
say
as
--
as
applied
to
this
plaintiff,
you
make
a
point
of
the
--
of
the
state
of
culture
or
to
this
particular
plaintiff?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
this
isn't
yick
wo
case,
that's
what
i
want
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
this
--
these
were
allowed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
would
apply
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix

what's
the
condemnation
here
for?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
public
use?

street
and
--
and
does
the
--
how
was
the
condemnation
decided
upon,
the
--
the
city
of
florida?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
talk
about
it,
the
board
of
commissioners
meet
in
public?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
they
go
into
a
court?
and
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
they
would
like
to
have
this
piece
of
properties
or
--
or
a
street
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
go
wherever
it
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
--
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
mostly
an
antecedent
determination
to
go
into
court
if
it
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
in
other
words,
to
being
in
the
district
who
advertises.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
--
is
there
a
local
paper
that
talk
about
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
think
in
the
old
times
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
much
of
a
stretch
of
--
this
is
a
street?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
was
the
length
of
the
street
that
was
to
be
made?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
how
many
other
people's
property
--
or
what
does
--
with
this
new
cut
made?
justice
felix
frankfurter
35
separate
parties?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
stated
carrying
the
--
what
is
the
effect
of
the
confirmation
of
the
appraisal
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understood
you
to
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understand
you
correctly
to
say
that
his
address
is
available.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
it
says.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
litigating
nearly
the
condemnation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
is
he
taking
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
is
not
a
value
of
property
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
mean
is
in
as
much
the
suggestions
we
had
that
something
that
was
$10,000
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
it
was
found
to
be
worth
$367.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
is
challenging
the
right
of
the
state
to
the
city
to
say
we
need
this
for
a
public
purpose,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
issue
namely
that
the
--
the
challenge
is
to
the
claim
of
the
city
--
with
the
city
but
they
need
this
for
a
public
purpose
and
under
that,
what
would
(inaudible)
the
challenge
that
it
is
in
the
public
purpose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
idea
of
--there's
motivation
into
this
in
the
mullane
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
why
don't
you
set
upon
to
your
argument
--
why
don't
you
go
to
the
question
presented
as
the
basis
of
your
jurisdiction
that
relates
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
page
3,
the
question
presented
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
question
1,
whether
(inaudible)
1949,
26-202
of
the
statutes
of
kansas
which
permits
a
city
to
give
notice
of
the
commencement
or
condemnation
proceeding
in
real
property
by
publication,
one
time
in
the
official
city
paper
if
they
permit
the
due
process
of
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
but
why
that
these
(inaudible)
to
the
attorneys
that
is
correct
in
saying
what
you
are
challenging
here
is
the
proceeding
whereby
he's
condemned
and
you're
not
saying
you
have
(inaudible)
$10,000
worth
or
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
--
all
i
know
is
the
question
that's
in
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
question
in
my
understanding
(inaudible)
to
the
--
to
the
challenges
giving
the
notice
of
the
condemnation
proceedings
merely
by
publication
and
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
--
is
there
any
argument
--
any
question
presented
that
has
probably
worth
ever
so
much
more
than
it
was
appraised
as
being
taken
without
any
process.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
--
you
can't
waive
anything
and
you're
restricted
by
the
question
presented.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
one
--
that
is
one
reading
the
ordinary
and
that's
unnecessary.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
saw
the
legislature
of
kansas,
of
that
statute
and
say,
we
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
don't
think
it
could.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
the
new
york
legislature
shall,
by
legislative
act,
rather
by
delegated
authority
to
say
the
old
property
that
as
these
two
joints
in
the
grant
that
(inaudible)
that
these
and
these
public
purposes
be
hereby
condemned
leading
the
question
of
appraisal
to
have
cope
within.
you
don't
think
that
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
--
if
there's
anything
to
accept
within
the
law,
i
should
say,
it
is
that
the
exercise
of
eminent
domain
is
a
legislative
authority
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
the
due
process
doesn't
yet
require
that
you
have
to
have
a
hearing
before
a
legislature
passes
an
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
his
point
is
not
yet
said
though
in
the
practical
purpose
it
--
it
has
never
found
it's
possible
to
define
that
a
legislative
determination
for
public
purpose
is
a
subject
to
judicial
review
as
to
whether
it
is
to
a
public
purpose.
in
other
words,
i
don't
know
of
any
--
of
any
breach
of
governmental
power
that
it
is
far
to
barring
all
the
taxation
as
the
condemnation
of
property
to
public
purposes.
now,
the
cases
still
allow
or
the
other
order
by
this
court
to
say,
this
is
so
obviously
not
a
public
service
that
is
thereby
must
be
unconstitutional
like
anything
else,
but
the
primary
for
that
or
whether
condemnation
can
be
directly
by
a
legislative
act,
and
i
didn't
suppose
that
it
was
disputable
with
this
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
that
is
so,
then
you
don't
need
notice
because
nobody
is
ignorant
about
having
to
suggest
that
before
a
legislature
pass
then
an
act,
it
must
have
a
hearing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
levy
in
your
--
in
your
--
what
was
your
original
pleading
of
complaint?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that
petition
is
an
allegation
of
property
whereas
x
dollars
condemned
for
x
minus
y
dollars?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
for
all
we
know,
the
amount
at
which
this
was
assessed
with
a
fair
assessment
for
all
we
know
in
this
litigation,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
i
know
--
and
what
the
claim
is,
you
didn't
give
thought
to
add
notice,
but
for
all
we
know,
the
actual
dollars
(inaudible)
are
precisely
those
(inaudible)
that
you're
entitled
not
--
anymore,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
certainly,
if
the
owner
of
the
property
knows
that
his
property
is
good,
he
can
claim,
he
can
--
if
--
if
my
property
is
condemned,
and
i
complain
about
it,
i
ought
to
be
in
the
position
to
say
you
could
take
me
something
and
deprive
your
property,
how
would
you
have
been
deprived
of
property?
you've
been
deprived
of
the
abstract
right
to
be
heard,
not
a
property.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
is
an
abstract
right.
(inaudible)
cant
walk
into
the
street,
you
say
there's
been
a
denial
of
notice
which
is
part
of
due
process,
he
must
say,
“i'm
at
a
property,”
as
a
sort
of
denial
of
due
process.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
come
in
here
and
asking
this
court
to
offset
a
judgment
of
the
state
court
and
the
deprivation
of
property.
and
there
is
in
those
words
or
it
is
a
suggestion
in
this
whole
litigation
that
you've
been
deprived
of
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
because
you
didn't
get
notice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
it's
a
whole
--
generally,
we
said
to
protest
against
the
taking
and
on
a
print,
he
can't
do
any
better
than
say,
deprived
of
his
property
and
not
--
and
never
make
a
specific
allegation
that
is
a
result
of
this
denial.
i
have
noticed,
i
will
deprive
the
approximately
of
x
hundred
dollars
or
x
thousand
dollars.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
that's
what
a
denial
of
property
mean,
it
doesn't
mean
the
exact
denial
of
due
process.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
the
--
if
it's
a
matter
of
state
pleading
then
the
state
have
decided
against
him
because
they've
given
a
judgment
against
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
asking
--
something
on
judgment
of
taking
a
property
and
where
was
the
property
that
was
taken?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
where
is
the
property
that
has
been
defined
with
the
deprivation,
that
--
that
gives
me
the
(inaudible)
of
the
property,
it
doesn't
give
me
the
deprivation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
wouldn't
--
that
wouldn't
have
been
so,
you
can
think
without
compensation
before
the
statute
provided
the
compensation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
was
suggesting
they
took
this
part
and
they
didn't
give
you
anything
for
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
it's
in
the
--
it's
in
the
treasury
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
in
the
treasury
of
the
city.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
levy,
may
i
make
concrete
what
i
understand
as
to
the
--
the
final
question
is
and
what
might
require
us
in
order
to
pursue
in
regard
to
damages.
we
had
a
case
here
last
term,
the
chief
justice
wrote
the
opinion,
(inaudible)
in
which
there
was
a
--
a
forfeiture
of
property
dated
on
page
5
and
the
question
of
notice
being
given
to
an
incapacitated
woman.
and
the
point
of
that
case
was
that
the
city
rested
on
the
so-called
constructive
notice
and
with
the
result
that
property
would
--
many
times
what
the
tax
indebtedness
was
fell
to
the
city
and
therefore,
we
withdraw
from
this
poor
woman
who
lost
her
property
because
she
(inaudible)
could
have
noticed.
now,
there's
nothing
like
that
in
this
case,
is
there,
on
these
pleadings.
this
isn't
a
suggestion
that
because
of
lack
of
notice
property
condemned
was
appraised
which
have
(inaudible)
or
conceivably
or
importantly
a
lot
of
the
smaller
figures
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
isn't
right
to
have
the
case
we
have
when
it's
the
opposite
there.
it
was
claimed
properly,
i
forget
the
exact
figures
the
chief
justice
remembers
them,
the
property
was
(inaudible)
as
much
fell
to
the
city
because
a
much
smaller
tax
wasn't
paid.
that
is
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
because,
in
the
end,
no
matter
how
much
money
you
pay,
you
may
not
want
the
properly
taken.
you
are
too
young
to
remember
the
famous
spite
--
little
spite
house
corner
in
new
york
for
which
makes
--
it
wanted
to
pay
a
terrific,
a
vast
amount
of
money
and
this
owner
said
no.
i
like
it,
it's
my
piece
of
property.
now,
that's
(inaudible)
public
to
condemn
the
property.
some
(inaudible)
did
request
some
money,
they
want
to
hang
on
to
their
own,
they
don't
want
any
of
that
improvement.
but
it
doesn't
follow
because
a
man
who
would
take
--
against
the
exercise
of
eminent
domain,
it's
merely
a
question
of
dollars
and
cents.
and
as
the
city
attorney,
i'm
sorry
i
don't
know
the
exact
title,
the
counsel
for
(inaudible)
pointed
out.
sometimes
the
appraisal
may
be
too
high
for
the
city
to
comfort.
and
they
say,
well,
we
don't
--
we
will
pursue
that
part.
so
it
isn't
merely
a
question
of
valid
(inaudible)
whether
it
was
against
eminent
domain.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
stand
out
to
deflect
the
answer,
(inaudible)
of
the
petition.
