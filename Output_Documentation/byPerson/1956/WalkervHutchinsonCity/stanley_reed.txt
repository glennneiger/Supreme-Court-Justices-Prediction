--
that's
a
different
problem.
that
problem

the
law
that
may
presume
to
go
to
the
location
of
the
property
that

the
impression
last.
justice
stanley

but
that's
the
only
notice
of
the
appraisal
--
justice
stanley

--
as
you
stand
and
the
determination
of
the
fact
that
it
will
be

in
the
last
paragraph
that

i
--
i
understand
the
property
is
taken
without
any
judicial
process
(voice

justice
stanley
reed
but
assuming
that
one
can
take
it
without
any
notice
at
all
or
in
a
hearing,
it
doesn't
--
that
case
doesn't
go
as
far
as
to
say
that
you
can
reach
the
compensation
without.
justice
stanley
reed
where's
the
money

consist
of,
posting
the
notices
on
the

justice
stanley
reed

mr.
levy
i
would
--
i
wish
you
would
state
your
position
with
regard
to
whether
this
is
a
proceeding
to
object
to
the
fixing
of
price
or
--
or
whether
it's
a
proceeding
of
taking
the
price.

to
pay
for
the
--
the
fixing
of
the
compensation.
