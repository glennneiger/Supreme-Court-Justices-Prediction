justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
why
--
i
don't
understand
why
you
say
this
serves
only
the
right
of
entries.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
answer
to
an
inquiry
and
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
--
the
only
thing
put
part
in
the
petition
which
--
since
this
is
true,
this
is
the
question
of
adjoining
the
entry.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let
us
suppose
one
should
view
the
view
of
that
the
entire
proceeding
was
not
void
in
taking
this
perfectly
problem
but
that
would
be
in
compensation
that
has
not
been
fairly
determined
since
no
notice
was
given
as
to
the
compensation
directly
for
the
party.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
have
the
land.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
have
difficulties
with
regard
to
that
as
the
counsel
regards
to
--
where
--
where
do
you
state
in
your
petition
that
you've
been
objecting
or
to
the
--
to
the
fixing
of
the
compensation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
stated
in
your
record
on
page
1,
1
to
5.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
familiar
with
the
case
of
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
case
would
seem
to
indicate
that
the
taking
here
would
be
entirely
illegal.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
was
the
question
of
compensation
that
becomes
important?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
--
then
why
did
you
ask
for
an
injunction
in
your
--
prior
to
the
petition
--
prior
to
the
petition
doesn't
have
to
--
can
you
think
about
your
compensation
in
anyway?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
the
lead
for
the
city
of
wichita?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
you
mentioned
section
202
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
preferably
to
solely
--
to
keep
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
city
off
your
property,
close
the
road,
i
suppose?
