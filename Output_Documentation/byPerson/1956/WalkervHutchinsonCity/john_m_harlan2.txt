justice
john
m.
harlan
did
they
give
the
names
of
the
property
owners
too?
no,
it
does
not.
it
describes
the
land
but
does
not
give
the
name
of
the
property
owners.
now,
this
is
no
secret
proceeding
by
any
means.
in
a
town,
our
size
with
35,000
people,
we
have
a
newspaper
with
a
circulation
of
55,000,
which
sounds
like
some
people
buy
a
couple
a
day,
but
at
any
rate,
it
is
very
well
read
and
there
is
a
reporter
from
the
newspaper
that
covers
all
of
the
meetings
of
the
commissions,
and
he
attends
the
--
and
he
comes
by
the
city
all
everyday
for
a
news
and
i
can
assure
you
that
there
is
no
secrecy
involved
or
intended
in
any
case
of
this
nature
at
all.
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
littooy,
do
you
happen
to
have
a
copy
of
the
actual
notice
as
it
was
printed
that
--
the
pay
of
the
newspapers?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
wanted
to
see
the
print.
justice
john
m.
harlan
no
wonder
whether
you
would
deal
at
some
point,
not
now,
necessarily,
with
the
practical
considerations
or
difficulties
that
the
city
do
think
the
city
would
be
faced
if
actual
notice
was
made
over
these
people.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
in
the
case
of
mr.
walker,
was
there
any
problem?
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
i
understand
you
to
say
to
the
chief
justice
that
the
city
did
not
have
walker's
address?
justice
john
m.
harlan
he
did
have
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
would
you
say
about
the
mullane
case
in
this
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
consequences
and
the
taking
here
would
be
much
more
severe
than
the
consequences
and
that
is
to
accounting
in
the
mullane
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
it
laid
down
a
pretty
flexible
rule.
we
have
to
deal
the
situation
case
by
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
notice
of
taking
does
the
kansas
statute
provide
for?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
up
until
five
minutes
ago,
i
had
understood
this
case
involved
only
the
question
of
damages.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
it
seems
to
be
a
matter
confusing
as
to
whether
it
does
or
whether
it
doesn't,
what
is
your
position,
does
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
then
why
are
you
trying
to
drag
in
the
question
of
taking?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
is
it
a
practical
matter?
suppose
in
this
case
is
the
reverse,
you
win
it,
what
are
you
going
to
do,
you're
going
into
--
are
you
really
going
into
relitigate
or
litigate
--
litigate
the
question
of
how
much
you've
got
for
this
property?
what
are
you
seriously
going
to
do?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you
think
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
you
adjudicate
this
case
on
that
kind
of
a
false
set
of
assumption?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
you
haven't
paid
actually.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you've
been
for
something.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
then
we
adjudicate
--
