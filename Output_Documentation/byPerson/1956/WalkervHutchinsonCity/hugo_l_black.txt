certainly,
that's

may
i
ask,
you
also
have
notice
by
a
publication
sometime
in
connection
with
lawsuits,
do
you
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
do,
as
always
contained
the
name
of
the
persons
for
the
lawsuit?
justice

black
do
you
have
any
other
system
at
all
that
you
give
notice
by
publication
where
the
names
are
left
out
except
the
--
justice

black
does
it
give
the
name
of
the
--
justice

--
decedent?
justice

what

is
that?
justice

this
particular
notice.
justice

what

is

was
it
on?
do
you
know?
(voice

justice
hugo

black
the
commission
breaks.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
they
go
and
view
the
property
and
then
go
back
to
complete
their
appraisal.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
correct.
justice
hugo
l.
black
commissioners
did
the
appraisal.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
three
appraisers,
not
the
commissioners.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
does
the
--
does
the
landowner
have
to
deal?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
after
the
appraisal.
justice
hugo
l.
black
after
the
appraisal.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
law
doesn't
require
that,
does
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
--
you're
--
you're
defending
now
in
fact
that
is
the
custom
of
the
paper
to
do
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
the
kansas
law,
when
does
the
city
have
a
right
to
use
the
property
under
its
condemnation
of
proceeding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
been
paid
in
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
how
--
on
the
kansas
law,
would
he
be
entitled
to
a
restraining
order
then
such
as
he
seeks
here
at
all
even
if
he's
right
on
his
contention?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
--
do
you
think
that
the
standpoint
of
due
process,
there
might
be
a
different
rule
in
connection
that's
taking
the
property
and
in
connection
with
paying
it
support's
real
value?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
in
this
case,
does
kansas
have
a
right
under
his
law,
does
it
assume
the
right
to
take
the
property
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
for
public
use?
justice
hugo
l.
black
without
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
take
it
immediately.
justice
hugo
l.
black
here,
i
notice
the
complaint
does
not
raise
any
question
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
as
to
the
values.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
the
taking
of
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
of
the
problem.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
belief
that
a
judgment
in
your
favor
in
this
case
would
bar
an
action
in
connection
with
the
value
of
the
property
under
the
appraisal.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
make
it
more
like
the
mullane
case,
would
it
not,
if
it
were
--
according
to
the
argument
you
just
made
if
it
related
to
the
compensation
only.
justice
hugo
l.
black
instead
of
the
condemnation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
has
raised
that
question
with
reference
to
the
--
to
try
to
upset
the
taking
of
the
property
by
the
state
--
by
the
city.
and
there's
no
question
raised
here
at
all
in
connection
with
the
condemnation
except
as
it
--
in
connection
with
the
valuation
except
that
it
might
be
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
adjudicated
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
but
i
--
i
understood
you
to
say
that
you
distinguish
between
this
in
the
mullane
case
on
the
ground
that
the
courts
have
treated
condemnation
cases
different.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
by
that
dictating
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
you
looked
at
any
complaint,
he's
asking
about
the
complaint.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
levy,
may
i
--
i'd
like
the
cause
of
--
you
can
answer
because
i
would
like
to
give
and
answer
the
brief
and
it's
something
later.
your
petition
alleges
that
they
take
in
his
length,
it
alleges
that
he
wants
me
to
stop
trespassing
enough
appraised
for
the
injunction
to
keep
him
from
--
to
stop
trespassing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
says
nothing
at
all
about
the
compensation.
it
rest
on
the
charge
that
there
are
two
sections
of
the
statute,
each
of
which
is
unconstitutional,
the
201
and
202.
so
that
you
have
a
complaint
which
raises
no
question
of
compensation
either
raises
the
question
that
the
city
is
not
entitled
to
have
the
land,
it
belongs
to
him
here.
now,
you
go
to
the
supreme
court,
the
supreme
court
refers
to
both
sections
of
the
statute
in
its
opinion
and
it
rest
almost
the
time
on
eminent
domain
which
says
nothing
about
compensation.
it
relies
on
cases
that
have
been
resting
on
eminent
domain.
it
does
not
indicate
that
there's
any
issue
here
in
connection
with
the
amount
of
compensation.
it
treats
it
on
the
same
basis
of
the
complaint
there
and
i
cannot
see
yet.
to
me,
there's
quite
a
difference,
perhaps,
that
this
kind
of
notice,
it
should
be
given
in
connection
with
the
taking
of
property
for
a
public
use.
and
the
amount
that's
to
be
paid
for
that
property
for
public
use
and
i
do
not
see
here
how
that
question
of
the
amount
to
be
paid
has
been
litigated
of
with
that
matter
why
this
judgment,
if
rendered
either
way
would
bar
future
suits
to
litigate
that
question.
i
don't
see
any
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
referred
--
it
referred
to
both
sections
that
when
you
get
to
202,
you
find
that
it
was
necessary
to
refer
to
202
because
it
defines
not
merely
to
an
appraisal
but
to
the
taking
of
the
land,
202
says,
the
commission
as
reported
by
the
judge
of
the
district
court
shall
give
any
owner,
an
(inaudible)
holder
of
a
record
of
the
properties
sought
to
be
taken
at
least
10
days
notice
in
writing
of
the
time
and
place
when
and
where
the
damage
will
be
assessed
about
one
publication
of
the
officials
city
paper
and
so
forth.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
a
--
in
a
complaint,
which
relates
merely
to
the
alleged
wrong
as
being
perpetrated
on
a
place
by
the
city
trespassing
on
his
property
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
complaint
raises
no
question
of
any
kind
or
carelessness
about
the
compensation.
and
the
issues
did
not
involve
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
--
i'm
just
giving
you
my
trouble
so
that
it
appear
--
so
far
as
i'm
concerned
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
do
not
see
here
yet
quite
how
we
could
consider
it
on
the
questions
of
damages
and
i
personally
would
think
that
this
would
not
adjudicate
time.
the
constitutionality
of
the
states
law
in
connection
with
the
taking
of
this
man's
--
and
that
compensation
to
be
paid
just
after
recovery.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you're
only
on
a
question
of
litigation,
naturally,
that's
the
issue
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
would
be
a
relitigation
or
whether
if
that
has
been
relitigated
or
no.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
it
has,
it's
been
litigated
without
being
raised
in
the
field.
