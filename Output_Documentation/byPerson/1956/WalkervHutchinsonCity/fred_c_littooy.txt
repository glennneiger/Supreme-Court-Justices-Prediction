mr.
fred
c.
littooy
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
may
it
please
the
court.
during
the
argument
by
mr.
levy
yesterday,
there
were
some
pertinent
questions
asked
by
embers
of
the
court
in
regard
to
the
procedure
used
in
kansas,
an
imminent
domain
proceedings.
mr.
levy
of
new
york
apparently
is
not
too
well
acquainted
with
our
condemnation
law
in
kansas
and
so
i
would
like
to
briefly
outline
to
the
court
the
manner
in
which
we
have
for
the
last
40
or
more
years
condemned
property
in
kansas.
the
statute
which
is
under
consideration
now
was
enacted
in
1913
and
although
it
may
not
be
horrid
by
eastern
standards,
it,
at
least
is
venerable
by
our
kansas
standards.
there
--
this
statute
has
been
used
by,
not
only
cities
but
by
counties,
by
townships,
by
school
boards,
by
the
state
of
kansas,
in
other
words,
by
any
governmental
unit
that
condemns
land
in
kansas.
i
would
not
estimate
how
many
pieces
of
property
have
been
condemned
for
public
purposes
under
this
statute.
greatly,
this
is
the
way
it
works.
the
procedural
statute
requires
that
the
city
passed
a
resolution
finding
that
it
is
necessary
to
condemn
certain
land
for
public
purpose.
in
this
case,
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
widening
a
street.
this
resolution
directs
the
city
engineer
to
prepare
the
description
of
the
land
and
a
survey
of
the
same
that
is
necessary
for
this
condemnation
and
present
the
same
to
the
city
commission.
this
resolution
is
published
in
the
official
city
paper.
at
the
following
meeting,
we
incidentally
have
a
meeting
every
friday
morning,
as
required
by
law,
at
the
following
meeting,
this
description
from
the
engineer
of
the
land
necessary
to
be
--
be
condemned
as
presented
to
the
city
commission.
the
city
commission
then
instructs
me
as
city
attorney
to
prepare
an
ordinance
declaring
it
necessary
to
condemn
this
land
for
public
purpose,
which
i
had
been
due
and
this
ordinance
is
read
twice
as
required
by
law.
it's
been
on
first
reading
at
one
meeting
and
passed
at
the
following
meeting
assuming
that
the
commission
desires
to
pass
it.
the
ordinance
is
then
published
on
the
official
city
paper
as
required
by
law
and
this
ordinance
passed
by
as
the
land
to
be
condemned
and
the
purpose
for
which
it
is
condemned
that
specifies
the
voids
that
has
been
read
from
the
street
that
is
going
to
be
condemned.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
he
would
not,
except
by
the
publication
in
the
newspaper.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
in
that
same
newspaper,
it
must
be
the
official
city
paper
as
required
by
a
statute.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
yes,
we
do,
of
course,
quite
all.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
yes,
they
do.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
yes
we
do.
in
probate
proceedings,
when
a
state
is
commenced
or
closed,
there
is
a
notice
published
in
the
paper
that
--
that
there
was
a
petition
for
the
probate
of
the
will
and
that
petition
will
be
heard
on
a
certain
day.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
it
does
not.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
it
gives
the
name
of
the
decedent,
yes.
that
is
correct.
then,
after
this
ordinance
is
published
and
then
--
and
becomes
effective
which
is
actually
the
taking
of
the
land
there,
finding
that
it
is
necessary
to
take
it,
it
is
a
legislative
taking,
the
ordinance
then
directs
the
city
attorney
to
make
application
to
the
clerk
of
the
district
court
of
the
county
for
the
appointment
of
appraisers
to
meet
and
appraise
this
land.
that
application
is
filed
with
the
district
court
and
then
the
judge
appoints
three
appraisers
who
take
their
oath
and
these
appraisers
then
publish
the
notice
which
you
see
here
in
this
transcript.
this
--
this
notice
must
be
published
one
time
in
the
official
city
paper,
it
must
be
published
at
least
10
days
before
the
appraisers
meet.
in
this
case,
it
was
actually
published
13
days
before
the
appraisers
met.
there
is
no
question
of
with
what
the
procedure
used
by
the
city
followed
the
statute.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
in
the
transcript,
the
notice
--
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
--
is
on
page
22,
or
26,
excuse
me.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
page
7,
excuse
me,
page
7
is
the
notice.
this
track
one
described
on
this
notice
is
the
land
owned
by
mr.
walker
which
was
condemned.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
yes,
it
does.
his
name
is
found
in
the
heading.
it
is
addressed
to
the
various
landowners
and
it
shows
lee
walker's
name
and
then
this,
it
does
not
show
up
where
the
track
itself.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
that
is
correct.
we
have
just
completed
a
large
auditorium
or
sports
arena
there
in
hutchinson
and
we
had
a
street
running
by
it
and
had
to
widen
the
street
in
order
to
take
care
of
the
traffic
that
went
by
there.
it
was
a
matter
of
common
knowledge.
now,
i,
whether
or
not,
mr.
walker
knew
or
whether
not,
i
have
no
way
of
knowing
that.
but
certainly,
the
improvement
of
the
billing
in
this
sports
arena
and
the
improvement
of
the
street
by
it
was
certainly
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
and
of
wide
interest
in
our
town,
of
course.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
i
dot
not.
not
with
me,
we
have
--
we
have
one
available.
it
is
just
that's
shown
in
here.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
well,
it's
a
legal
notice
print.
i
--
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
it
is
usually
in
the
back,
on
the
last
two
pages
of
the
paper.
all
our
legal
notices
are
published
in
the
same
place,
right
near
the
funny
papers.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
oh,
yes.
i
am
sure
there
are
--
there
are
ordinarily
several
published
everyday.
now,
this
--
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
no,
no.
this
--
this
paper
has
two
issues,
a
morning
and
an
evening
issue
and
the
notice
is
published
in
both
the
morning
and
evening
issue
of
the
paper.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
we
do
not.
our
county
treasurer's
assessment
roles
do
not
contain
the
address
of
the
taxpayer.
they
have
the
name
of
the
record
owner
there
and
they
have
the
address
of
the
piece
of
real
estate
that
the
record
owner
might
live
in
another
part
of
town
or
even
out
of
town.
it
is
not
the
--
the
address
of
the
record
owner
that
is
shown
on
the
tax
rolls.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
yes,
i
--
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
yes,
sir.
the
commissioners
then
published
this
notice
and
they
meet
at
the
time
and
place
specified
in
the
notice
and
then
proceed
to
the
particular
pieces
of
property
which
are
to
be
condemned
to
appraise
it
on
the
spot.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
yes,
it
does.
in
other
words,
it
appears
in
the
last
notice
that
they're
going
to
meet,
at
the
last
paragraph,
they
will
meet
at
the
house
of
the
city
engineering
and
then
--
and
there
to
commence
and
proceed
of
the
duties
imposed
and
was
required
by
law
which
is
required
that
they
view
and
appraise
the
property.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
well
this
provides
--
this
shows
where
they
meet
and
ordinarily,
they
meet
in
the
city
engineers
office
to
commence
and
ordinarily
property
owners
come
right
in
there
at
the
very
beginning
and
discuss
it,
the
--
the
appraisal
with
them
right
there
and
then
they
proceed
to
the
particular
pieces
of
property.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
that's
correct.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
that
is
correct.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
and
then
these
--
these
appraisers
then
proceed
to
the
particular
place
of
property
involved.
if
so,
they
always
go
to
the
house
at
the
landowners
there
to
try
to
talk
with
him
about
it,
if
he
is
not,
of
course,
then
they
go
ahead
and
appraise
the
property.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
they
do
not
have
to,
that
is
correct.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
that
is
correct.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
yes.
the
statute
requires
a
view
and
appraisal
for
the
view
of
the
property.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
the
--
the
appraisers
--
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
the
three
appraisers.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
no,
the
three
appraisers,
they're
called
commissioners.
on
our
statute,
they're
actually
appraisers.
these
three
commissioners
appointed
to
appraise.
so
they
view
the
property,
then
they
file
the
report
with
the
city
clerk
and
this
report
then
is
referred
to
the
city
commission
at
its
next
meeting
for
approval
or
disapproval.
in
other
words,
it
might
be
that
the
city
might
wish
to
appeal
from
some
of
the
values
set
by
the
appraisers.
they
might
think
they're
too
high.
the
city
might
wish
to
abandon
some
particular
part
of
the
proceeding
of
the
condemnation
and
the
city
has
10
days
after
the
report
is
filed
within
which
to
pass
a
resolution
abandoning
any
course
on
the
proceedings
they
wish.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
he
has
30
days
from
the
time
this
report
of
commissioners
has
filed
with
the
city
commission.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
after
--
pardon,
sir?
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
yes,
after
the
appraisal
is
filed.
in
other
words,
the
commissioners
file
their
reported
with
the
city
commission
and
then
the
landowner
has
30
days
from
that
time
in
which
to
appeal
to
the
district
court
and
have
a
full
hearing
de
novo
by
jury
as
to
the
question
of
his
damages.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
i
do
not
believe
that
--
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
i
do
not
believe
that
the
record
does
show
when
it
was
filed.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
it
would
have
--
it
was
filed
in
may
sometime.
as
i
--
so,
it's
file
just
shortly
after
the
--
it's
condemnation
of
--
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
that's
correct.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
that
is
correct.
they
do.
the
--
the
reporter
from
city
hall
is
that
our
commission
meeting
and
when
the
appraiser's
report
is
filed
there,
it
is
actually
they're
accustomed
in
a
new
story
and
usually
on
the
front
page
to
show
what
the
awards
are
with
all
the
landowners.
so
that
they
know
actually
from
that,
from
a
new
story,
because
i
say,
there
is
full
publicity
given
this,
it's
not
a
sort
of
the
thing
--
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
pardon,
sir?
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
that
is
correct.
that's
not
required
by
law
that
it
is
done,
that's
just
a
--
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
it
does
not.
the
record
simply
shows
what
was
done
pursuant
to
the
statute
in
this
case.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
after
the
appraisement,
yes.
we
always
file
our
report
of
commissioners
with
the
district
court
and
with
the
clerk
of
the
city
court
--
with
the
clerk
of
the
city
commission,
excuse
me.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
that
is
correct.
that
--
that
is
so
and
this
--
and
as
indicated
in
this
north
laramie
versus
hoffman
case,
this
court
held
that
the
necessity
and
expediency
of
the
taking
of
property
for
public
use
are
legislative
questions
and
a
hearing
thereon
is
not
essential
to
due
process
to
taking
itself.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
no,
that
--
that's
correct.
that
is
correct.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
i'd
go
in
the
district
court
and
file
a
proceeding
--
mandamus
proceeding
to
make
them
let
me
on
there.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
oh
no
--
no
we
own
the
property
then
for
that
particular
use
after
this
was
completed
and
after
we
have
paid
the
money
out,
of
course.
we
have
to
pay
the
money
in
before
we're
entitled
to
possession.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
no
sir,
there
is
none.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
we
pay
the
money
into
the
city
treasurer
and
then
he
sends
a
voucher
to
the
individual
landowners
to
come
in
and
get
their
money.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
yes
it
was.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
the
record
does
not
show
and
i
don't
believe
here
but
it
was
--
it
was
paid
in
to
the
city
treasurer
and
the
--
mr.
walker
did
not
accept
the
money.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
eight
hundred
dollars.
this
--
mr.
walker
has
indicated
in
this
transcript
to
own
12
lots
here.
on
page
2
of
the
transcript,
it
shows
the
description
of
his
lots,
this
property,
as
shown
on
page
7,
involved
track
one.
his
lots
were
165
feet
in
depth
and
the
eastern
four
lots
of
his
property,
we
did
not
even
touch,
and
we
took
a
triangular
piece
off
of
the
remainder
just
to
widen
the
street
there.
did
not
touch
the
--
the
property
where
his
--
his
home
itself
was
located.
this
was
all
unimproved
land
here.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
after
the
appraisers
filed
a
report
with
the
city
commission
and
with
the
clerk
at
the
district
court,
then
the
city
commission,
either
approves
or
disapproves
that
report.
in
other
words,
they
may
feel
that
the
prices
are
too
high
if
found
by
the
appraisers
and
will
wish
to
appeal
from
those
just
as
the
land
loan
owner
has
the
right
to
appeal
so
does
the
city
have
the
right
to
appeal.
on
the
other
hand,
they
may
wish
at
that
time
to
abandon
some
portion
of
the
condemnation
proceedings
as
to
some
particular
piece
of
land.
in
that
event,
they
have
10
days
after
the
--
the
commissioners
--
the
appraiser's
report
is
filed
within
which
to
abandon
the
proceedings
and
this
must
be
done
by
resolution.
if
they
do
not
abandon
it
within
10
days
then
they
--
they
are
left
with,
they
have
to
pay
the
award
or
appeal
from
it.
and
the
property
owner
has
30
days
within
which
to
appeal
from
these
commissioners,
appraisers
report
after
it
is
filed
with
the
city
commission
and
he
is
then
entitled
to
a
full
jury
trial
de
novo
on
the
district
court
on
the
question
of
the
amount
of
his
damages.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
then
he
is
paid
what
the
appraiser's
awarded.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
that
is
correct.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
as
soon
as
the
city
pays
in
to
its
city
treasurer
the
money
--
the
award
fixed
by
the
appraisers.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
yes,
it
could
be.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
yes,
sir,
it's
correct.
it
could
be.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
oh,
yes.
and
the
money
has
been
there
all
this
time.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
well,
that's
--
that's
for
these
people
to
explain
here,
i
guess.
our
courts
hand
that
he
was
not,
of
course,
in
this
case
entitled
to
a
restraining
order.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
i
think,
probably,
the
basic
reasoning
underlying
all
of
these
decisions
and
condemnation
cases
are
based
on
the
considerations
of
the
difficulty
of
giving
actual
personal
notice.
certainly,
there
are
some
people
whose
lands
are
condemned
who
you
can
--
whose
residence
you
can
ascertain
without
any
difficulty.
on
the
other
hand,
there
are
many
people
whose
residence
is
extremely
difficult
to
ascertain.
they
might
be
a
deceased
person
who
have
--
who
has
heirs.
he
might
be
a
nonresident
decedent
who
we
don't
know
where
he
lives.
we
don't
know
who
his
heirs
are.
there
may
have
been
in
a
state
conducted
in
a
--
in
another
county
or
another
state
and
he
has
heirs
right
there
in
our
time,
we
would
have
no
way
of
knowing
it.
that
--
that
is
one
of
the
biggest
difficulties
we
have
of
ascertaining
sometimes
who
did
lack
extra
landowners
are
and
where
they
would
live.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
there
would
be
no
problem
in
his
case.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
for
the
sale
of
property,
you
mean
under
tax
sale?
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
we
can
give
constructive
service
of
--
on
nonresidence.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
no.
it
consist
of
publications
in
the
--
in
the
official
county
paper
--
in
a
paper
of
general
circulation
in
the
county.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
no.
just
the
publication
in
the
paper.no
posting
on
the
property
is
required.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
that
is
correct,
you
file
an
affidavit
to
that
thing.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
no
it
would
not.
it
would
not.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
the
state
of
wisconsin
has
an
identical
statute
as
cited
in
my
brief,
the
one
with
(inaudible)
case
on
page
10
and
11
of
all
the
statute
that
provides
either
for
personal
service
of
notice,
five
days
before
the
appraisers
meet
or
public
--
one
publication
in
the
official
city
in
a
--
in
a
paper
designated
by
the
court
10
days
before
they
meet.
it
is
the
identical
same
statute.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
held
basing
it
on
previous
decisions
of
this
court
and
other
jurisdictions
that
it
is
universally
recognized
that
in
condemnation
proceedings,
the
summary
may
be
--
the
procedure
may
be
summary
and
the
notice
may
be
indirect
and
may
be
--
may
be
he
can
use
the
constructive
service
and
may
be
he
used
in
the
cases
of
both
residence
and
nonresidence.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
that
is
correct,
as
to
the
--
to
the
--
that
goes
as
to
the
damages
of
the
land.
the
statute
is
exactly
like
ours
and
it
goes
as
to
the
damages
and
the
court
clearly
points
that
out
that
they
feel
that
this
provides
due
process.
now,
this
is
not
the
only
jurisdiction
that
provides
for
a
constructive
notice
in
condemnation
proceedings,
missouri,
and
california,
wyoming,
as
shown
in
the
north
laramie
case
here
and
mississippi
among
others
all
provide
that
the
constructive
notice
is
adequate
notice
and
provides
due
process
and
condemnation
proceedings.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
by
--
by
notice,
by
publication
in
the
newspaper.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
only.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
that
is
correct.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
that
is
correct.
and
the
north
laramie
case
here
in
268
u.s.
276
indicates
that.
i'm
not
sure
--
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
that
applies
to
damages,
i
know,
in
california.
it
provided
set
of
this
street
opening
act
that
california
provided
due
process
nor
requiring
a
10-day
publication
notice
to
the
landowners
affected
after
an
assessment
of
their
damages
had
been
written
and
filed.
now,
--
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
no,
i
did
not
say
that.
i
did
not
say
that.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
yes
we
--
we
had
his
--
we
had
some
of
--
of
the
other
addresses
of
the
people
involved
here.
some
we
did
not
have.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
they
didn't
keep
it
on
the
tax
rows.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
that's
correct.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
they
keep
it
anywhere
that
i
know
it.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
except
on
a
telephone
directory,
of
course,
you
could
look
in
there.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
that
is
correct.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
that
is
correct.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
he
would
be
in
the
address
of
this
property
that
is
on
the
tax
rows.now,
as
i
say,
that
could
be
--
in
any
case,
it
could
be
the
address
of
a
property
and
he
might
live
somewhere
else,
he
might
not
even
live
on
his
property.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
pardon,
sir?
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
yes
--
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
that
is
correct.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
that
is
correct.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
now,
all
through
of
these
cases
in
the
textbook
dissertations
on
the
subject
that
i
have
ever
seen
or
read,
all,
universally
provide
that
in
condemnation
proceedings
that
notice
by
publication
in
the
paper
is
sufficient.
i
have
never
seen
a
case
yet
in
condemnation
that
does
not
say
so.
the
two
cases
cited
by
counsel
from
mr.
walker,
the
mullane
and
new
york
city
cases
involved
reorganization
of
a
railroad
under
the
bankruptcy
act
and
--
and
involved
a
final
accounting
by
a
trustee.
he
does
not
point
out
any
condemnation
case
that
i
can
find
anywhere
that
says
that
notice
by
publication
and
newspaper
does
not
provide
due
process
of
law.
the
authorities
that
i
have
cited
in
the
brief
all
agree
on
that
from
--
from
every
jurisdiction
that
we
have
been
able
to
find.
now,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
oh,
yes.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
yes.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
yes,
it
does.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
without
notice.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
take
it
immediately
after
he's
been
appraised
and
--
and
the
money
pay,
you
can't
take
it
until
we'd
paid
for
it.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
no.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
that's
correct.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
that's
correct.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
the
taking
--
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
the
--
well,
his
--
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
--
his
right
to
take
--
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
--
without
giving
him
notice
of
the
meeting
of
the
appraisers.
now,
yesterday,
in
closing,
i
want
to
point
out
that
mr.
justice
burton,
i
believe,
asked
the
counsel
for
appellant
if
he
could
distinguish
between
this
case
and
the
case
of
collins
versus
of
city
of
wichita.
that
case
found
its
way
up
here
just
about
the
same
time
this
case
found
his
way
up
here
last
year.
that
case
involved
the
city
of
wichita,
the
city
condemned
some
property
under
this
precise
same
statute
and
the
precise
same
question
was
raised
in
that
case
as
to
whether
or
not
this
statue
provided
for
due
process
of
law.
while
our
case
was
going
up
to
our
state
district
court
and
our
--
and
our
state
supreme
court,
that
case
was
finding
its
way
to
the
united
states
district
court
and
the
united
states
circuit
court.
and
in
that
case,
the
united
states
circuit
court
upheld
this
statute
as
comporting
with
the
due
process
provisions
of
the
constitution.
and
on
november
--
last
november
7,
this
court
denied
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
the
collins
case.
two
months
later,
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction
on
the
case
at
bar.
i
cannot
distinguish
the
two
cases.
and
for
the
reasons
that
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief,
then
here,
where
they
had
reasons
advanced
by
this
course
in
--
court
in
previous
decisions
involving
condemnation,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
state
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
kansas
upholding
this
statute
on
the
constitutionality
thereof
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
i
would
say
that
it
did
not
involve
an
eminent
domain
proceeding
and
that
--
and
that
this
court
made
no
effort
to
indicate
that
it
did
or
that
it
overruled
itself
in
the
north
--
in
the
north
laramie
case.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
that
is
quite
correct,
but
this
court
did
not
attempt
to
overrule
its
prior
decisions
in
condemnation
proceedings
in
that
mullane
case
either.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
no
question
--
no
question
about
that.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
in
this
--
for
mr.
walker?
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
yes
it
would.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
because
he
has
30
days
in
which
to
appeal
from
the
report
of
the
commissioners
after
it
has
filed
with
the
city
commission
to
appeal
and
--
and
regard
the
question
of
the
value
of
his
land.
he
did
not
appeal
within
30
days.
so,
he
will
receive
the
$800
awarded
by
the
appraisers.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
well,
it
--
it
concerns
the
value
of
the
land.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
well,
that
is
what
--
the
petition
attempted
to
do
was
to
enjoin
and
restrain
us
from
entering
upon
the
land
pursuant
to
this
condemnation
proceedings
for
the
reason
that
the
petitioner
claimed
that
the
--
that
the
condemnation
proceedings
were
entirely
void
being
based
on
a
statue
that
was
unconstitutional,
so
the
entire
proceeding
was
void
according
to
the
appellant's
petition.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
well,
in
that
case,
we
would
have
taken
the
land.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
we
would
have
the
land
but
we
would
not
have
determined
the
value
of
that
and
of
course,
since
that
time,
we
build
our
street
on
it
(inaudible)
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
well,
this
--
this
relates
not
only
to
that
--
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
that
he
--
he
thinks
that
he
needs
more
notice.
he
needs
person
on
service
of
notice.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
no
regard
to
this
matter
--
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
he
--
he
doesn't
--
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
he
doesn't
exactly
do
that.
he
--
he
thinks
this
all
condemnation
is
no
good.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
that
is
correct.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
no,
i
do
not
mean
that.
i
mean
the
determination
of
the
value,
the
north
laramie
case
is
distinctly
on
that
point
alone.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
it
--
well,
it
is
--
it
is
in
the
same
respect,
as
the
north
laramie
case,
it's
exactly
the
same.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
no.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
that's
--
that's
correct.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
he
is
that
--
right
here
now.
he
wants
to
--
that's
correct.
he
wants
the
notice.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
that's
possible.
mr.
fred
c.
littooy
none
--
none
whatsoever
in
my
view.
