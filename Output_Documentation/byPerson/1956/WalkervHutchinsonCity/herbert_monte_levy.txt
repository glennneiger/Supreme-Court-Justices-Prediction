mr.
herbert
monte
levy
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
issue
of
the
constitutionality
as
against
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
a
statute
of
kansas
which
permits
the
assessment
of
damages
in
condemnation
proceedings
upon
publication,
one
time
in
the
local
city
official
paper
of
notice
of
the
condemnation
proceedings.
there
is
an
alternative
method
provided
in
the
statute
for
personal
service
which
was
not
given
to
the
petitioner
here.
petitioner
here
never
received
actual
notice
of
the
condemnation
of
his
lands
or
of
the
assessment
of
damages,
brought
an
injunction
action
to
restrain
the
city
from
taking
over
the
property,
pressed
his
constitutional
point
hard
and
we
are
now
here
in
regard
to
that
constitutional
point.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
the
petitioner
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes,
sir.
the
petitioner
lived
in
the
city
of
hutchinson
which
was
also
in
the
same
county.
that's
on
page
2
of
the
record.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
i
might
add
that
--
well,
i
think
i'll
omit
that
for
the
moment.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes,
he
did,
your
honor.
actually,
that
does
not
appear
clearly
from
the
record.
there's
no
statement
to
that
effect,
but
his
address
is
given
on
page
2
of
the
transcript.
his
address
is
the
same
property
as
that
which
was
condemned,
only
part
of
it
was
condemned.
you
can't
tell
it
without
looking
at
the
maps,
but
i
assume
that
we
could
take
judicial
notice
of
that.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
correct,
your
honor.
there
was
no
notice
as
in
the
point.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no,
there
was
the
--
as
i
understand
the
proceedings,
they
first
would
declare
the
property
taken,
then
publish
a
notice
of
assessment
of
damages.
and
that
was
the
only
thing
that
was
published,
i
imagine
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
the
notice
that
was
published
was
a
statement
as
to
when
and
where
damages
would
be
taken.
notice
of
condemnation,
it
reads.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
it's
on
page
7,
page
7of
the
transcript.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
page
7
of
the
transcript,
sir.
the
notice
is
that
application
has
been
made
to
a
local
judge
to
appoint
commissioners
to
take
an
appraisal
of
the
land
and
make
assessment
of
the
damages.
now,
this
is
all
that
was
ever
published
or
that
was
ever
required
to
be
published.
your
honors
may
note
that
mr.
walker's
name,
if
you
could
find
it
quickly
is
in
the
second
full
paragraph
there,
it's
the
fourth
line
from
the
bottom
in
the
centre.
actually,
25th
and
a
list
of
33
names,
and
this
was
the
only
notice
ever
published.
the
alternative
method
was
not
taken.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
right.
it's
--
on
its
face
and
as
applied
to
this
particular
point
that
there
was
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
well,
some
statutes
may
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no,
i
don't
think
it's
the
yick
wo
case
at
all.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no
claim
of
that,
sir.
in
fact,
we
set
forth
in
our
jurisdictional
statement
that
generally,
the
city
of
hutchinson
and
the
neighboring
counties
insofar
as
we
are
able
to
find
out
had
always
proceeded
by
this
one-notice
method
and
by
no
other
ways.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no,
no
such
contention
at
all.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no,
sir.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no,
the
only
publication
was
this
one
notice
that
appears
in
page
7
of
the
transcript.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes,
they
did.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
right,
amongst
others.
that
was
not
--
never
published
anywhere.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
right.
well
actually,
the
taking
would
have
been
complete,
i
think,
by
the
time
of
the
publication
of
the
so-called
notice
of
condemnation
which
is
really
a
notice
of
appraisal.
i
think
that
taking
would
have
been
complete
then
and
we
aren't
raising
any
constitutional
objection
on
the
taking
as
to
lack
of
notice
on
that.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
right.
we
don't
need
--
we
--
the
question
hasn't
been
raised.
had
it
been
raised,
i
would
have
liked
to
have
pressed
the
point
that
even
a
legislative
taking
should
require
some
notice,
but
it
hasn't
been
raised
below
and
i
don't
think
i'm
entitled
to
raise
that
question
here,
sir.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes.
well
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
correct.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
correct,
or
that
it
was
going
to
be
assessed.
or
that
it
was
going
to
be
assessed
in
the
first
place.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
i
think
the
exact
same
section
of
the
statute
was
involved,
i
don't
see
any
way
to
distinguish
it.
i
think
that
the
decision
in
this
case
means
of
course
an
overruling
of
the
collins
case
too.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes,
your
honor.
although
frankly
i'm
a
little
puzzled
as
to
the
effect
of
overruling
a
decision
when
the
court
has
denied
certiorari
in
that
decision,
i'm
not
sure
just
where
that
leaves
everyone.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no,
i
mean
it
makes
that.
our
actual
point
of
course
is
the
constitutionality
of
this
particular
statute.
first,
the
idea
that
you
have
notice
by
one
publication,
secondly,
the
type
of
publication
where
the
name
vary.
and
thirdly,
the
real
question
as
to
whether
what
kind
of
notice
is
necessary
in
any
proceeding
pursuant
to
condemnation
to
establish
damages.
now,
i
think
that
i
might,
at
this
point
before
i
go
on
further,
clarify
one
other
point.
there
is
a
right
to
appeal
from
the
decision
of
the
assesses
fixing
the
damages.
and
in
the
north
laramie
case,
which
is
cited
in
my
brief,
it
was
indicated
that
as
long
as
there
is
that
right
to
appeal
and
there
is
publication
of
the
decision,
the
second
publication
after
the
first,
that
in
that
particular
case,
all
of
the
rights
of
the
rights
of
the
owner
of
the
property
had
been
preserved.
i
might
add
by
the
way
that
the
record
in
the
north
laramie
case
shows
that
the
complaining
party
actually
had
notice
pursuant
to
the
publication
after
the
assessment,
the
appraisal
of
damages,
that
he
actually
had
notice
of
the
appraisal
of
damages
and
he
did
not
exercise
his
right
to
appeal,
and
this
court
i
think
quite
properly
threw
him
out.
in
our
case,
there
again
would
be
a
right
to
appeal
to
the
courts
from
the
appraisal.
but
again,
there
is
a
30-day
limitation
on
that,
and
again,
no
notice
was
given
by
publication
or
any
other
way
of
the
actual
fixing
of
the
damages
on
appraisal.
so
that
this
man
never
had
any
notice
at
any
time
and
the
only
publication
was
one
publication
one
day,
and
there
was
no
other
notice
at
all,
even
though
the
statute
provides
an
alternative
method.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
30
days
after
the
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
right.
it
was
the
same
with
the
north
laramie.
the
decisions
of
this
court,
more
recently
i
think,
spell
out
very
clearly
that
the
distinctions
between
in
rem
and
in
personam
actions
are
not
the
controlling
factors
in
a
case
such
as
this.
the
real
question
is
the
adequacy
of
the
notice
whether
it's
reasonably
calculated
to
reach
the
parties
concerned.
and
the
two
leaning
cases
on
that,
the
most
recent
ones,
neither
of
which
were
alluded
to
by
either
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
or
the
supreme
court
of
new
mexico
are
the
mullane
and
the
city
of
new
york
cases
both
cited
again
in
my
brief.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
these
are
two
cases
and
--
did
i
say
new
mexico?
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
because
your
honors
granted
cert
to
me
in
the
new
mexico
case
last
monday
and
i
must
have
it
on
my
mind.
sorry
for
that.
in
the
mullane
case,
the
--
a
trustee
of
one
of
these
trusts
in
which
common
funds
are
pooled
was
allowed
to
give
notice
merely
by
publication
in
new
york
newspapers
of
various
proceedings
not
by
the
way
working
a
forfeiture
but
relating
merely
to
an
accounting
of
the
trustee.
four
publications
were
required.
this
court
held
that
even
with
four
publications
required
that
this
was
not
sufficient
whether
or
not
you
call
the
action
an
in
rem
or
an
in
personam
proceeding.
and
they
said
that
where
the
addresses
are
known,
as
they
are
known
here,
actual
notice
must
be
given.
and
again,
there
is
no
reason
why
that
shouldn't
be
done
here.
now,
in
the
mullane
case
by
the
way,
there
were
four
publications,
here
there
was
one
publication.
in
the
mullane
case,
actual
notice
of
the
statute
pursuant
to
which
publication
was
all
right
was
given
to
the
parties
affected.
and
here,
not
only
was
there
no
actual
notice
of
the
statute
but
the
statute
provided
alternative
means
of
giving
notice
and
there
was
really
no
reason
at
all
for
this
particular
man,
this
petitioner
here,
to
think
that
he
would
be
given
notice
by
one
publication
rather
than
by
any
other
method.
now,
this
court
went
even
further
in
the
city
of
new
york
case
where
you
had
a
clearly
in
rem
proceeding,
which
affected
the
rights
of
a
creditor,
which
was
the
city
of
new
york.
and
the
city
of
new
york
was
given
publication
notice
twice
a
week
in
five
papers.
in
other
words,
approximately
10
notices.
and
the
city
of
new
york
of
course
has
several
hundred
people
that
work
in
its
corporation
counsel's
office,
not
to
say
many
thousand
agents.
and
this
court
held
that
in
the
city
--
in
the
city
of
new
york
case
that
the
notice
by
publication
given
to
the
city
of
new
york
in
a
clearly
in
rem
proceeding
was
not
enough
notice.
why?
because
the
city
of
new
york
could
have
actually
and
easily
been
reached
and
it
was
not
reached.
it
could
have
gotten
a
mail
notice
just
as
mr.
walker
could
have
gotten
here.
now,
there
is
really
no
reason
that
we
can
see,
your
honors,
why
the
rule
originally
formulated
by
the
rigors
of
necessity
in
the
1880s
if
you
please,
why
the
rule
permitting
notice
by
publication
should
be
extended
to
cases
of
residence
of
a
community,
who
can
easily
be
given
actual
notice.
we
say
also
that
even
where
such
actual
notice
not
required
that
this
notice
by
one
publication
is
so
ephemeral
and
so
elusively
as
to
be
more
fantastic
really
than
even
a
fantasy
or
an
illusion.
i
can
think
of
a
no
other
less
quantitative
and
qualitative
notice
than
perhaps
having
a
skywriter
making
lazy
circles
in
the
sky
over
the
supreme
court
building
spelling
out
the
notice
of
condemnation,
though
i
think
that
would
get
considerably
more
notice
than
this
one
publication
did.
it
of
course
was
not
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
well,
that
--
it
is
my
exactly
--
point
that
it
is
contrary
to
due
process.
that's
the
issue,
your
honor.
and
as
to
it's
going
on
for
generations,
may
i
say
that
this
does
--
this
statute
does
not
come
with
a
usual
hoary
antiquity
that
most
statutes
come
to
--
come
with
to
this
court
because
the
statute
of
kansas
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
find,
so
far
as
mr.
littooy
has
been
able
to
find,
the
statute
of
kansas
is
unique
in
permitting
publication
and
permitting
notice
by
only
one
publication.
when
you
go
through
the
various
cases
that
are
cited
in
my
opponent's
brief
--
i
propose
to
reserve
that
for
rebuttal
if
the
court
pleases
on
that,
you'll
find
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no.
i
would
say
there
was
no
difference
there.
i
would
say
still,
where
you
can
reach
the
man,
due
process
requires
as
this
court
held
it
did
in
mullane
and
in
city
of
new
york,
due
process
requires
that
some
effort
be
made
actually
to
reach
him
if
his
address
is
known.
and
that
if
isn't
known,
there
must
be
some
reasonable
efforts
made
to
find
it
out.
that
that
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
the
old
statute?
pardon?
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
well,
i
think
that
you
will
find
that
in
the
--
are
--
are
you
speaking
about
the
kansas
statutes
or
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
well,
i
--
i
think
i
may
have
misled
you,
your
honor.
let
me
try
and
make
myself
a
bit
clearer.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
there
has
never
been
a
statute
in
any
other
states
so
far
as
i
know
permitting
publication
--
service
by
publication
with
one
publication.
there
have
been
statutes
in
other
states
and
even
federal
statutes
permitting
service
by
publication,
but
i
think
that
one
--
when
one
goes
into
them
and
analyses
the
records
in
the
various
cases,
it
will
found
almost
universally
that
in
most,
if
not
all
of
those
cases,
there
was
an
actual
attempt
made
to
reach
residents
for
persons
whose
names
and
addresses
were
known.
i
might
give
you
one
illustration
of
that.
for
example
in
the
case
of
newman
against
lynchburg,
236
u.s.
which
i
cite
for
one
proposition
and
my
opponent
cites
against
me
--
that
was
a
case
by
the
way
where
there
seven
publications
and
for
all
that
you
see
in
the
opinion,
service
by
publication
was
enough.
well,
when
you
look
at
the
record,
the
transcript
of
the
record
on
page
6
of
it,
you
find
that
in
addition
to
publication,
the
united
states
marshal
was
directed
to
serve
a
copy
of
the
notice
upon
such
owners
as
can
be
found
within
the
district
of
columbia
where
the
case
arose
and
upon
tenants
and
occupants
of
the
city.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that,
your
honor,
was
a
case
involving
the
question
of
whether
a
statutory
compliance
--
whether
there
had
been
compliance
with
federal
statutory
rules
in
making
a
condemnation.
there
was
no
question
of
constitutionality
in
that
case.
the
only
question
was
whether
the
statute
had
been
followed.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes,
that
was
a
condemnation
case.
there
were
seven
publications
by
the
way
there
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes.
as
i
recollect
it.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
condemnation
here
was
for
a
public
use
for
a
public
street,
directs
it.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
public
street.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
the
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes,
the
board
of
commissioners,
i
understand.
the
city
commissioners
decide
that.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
they
do,
at
the
record
at
some
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
they
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
i
think
the
--
the
order
--
the
--
now,
the
order
of
operation
is
--
is
a
little
--
it's
just
the
opposite.
they
first
go
into
court
and
then
they
give
notice
that
they
have
gone
into
court.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
and
this
is
the
one
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes,
a
resolution
which
again
isn't
published
anywhere
as
except
insofar
as
it
appears
in
this
notice
of
condemnation?
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
right.
and
there's
no
--
no
notice
given
to
anybody
of
any
sort.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
well,
there's
a
local
paper.
i
doubt
that
it
never
gets
much
publicity
when
they
decide
to
get
down
the
particular
area.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
sir?
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
small
print.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes,
sir.
we've
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
--
we've
made
the
point
he
had
always
paid
his
taxes
in
assessments
which
means
his
address
must
have
been
on
city
rolls
and
that
he
had
lived
in
the
same
address
for
50
years
on
this
property.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
50
years
on
this
piece
of
property.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
in
hutchinson
county
in
new
york.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
courthouse?
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
the
courthouse
in
which
they
did
this.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes,
the
courthouse
is
in
hutchinson.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
only
going
in
ex
parte
to
the
court.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
well,
that
again
is
in
page
7
on
the
notice
of
condemnation.
public
notice
is
hereby
given
as
required
by
law
that
any
application
has
in
it.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes,
this
is
what
they
had
published.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes.
they
had
filed
a
proceeding
before
they
started.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
ex
parte
as
far
as
i
know,
correct
sir?
mr.
oswald
is
from
kansas
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes,
mr.
oswald
would
like
to
comment
on
that
if
he
may,
sir?
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
running
through
to
9.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
actually,
your
honor,
as
i
believe
i
stated
yesterday,
the
only
question
i
think
that
we
can
really
properly
raise
here,
the
more
i
think
of
it,
the
more
i
become
convinced
to
that,
is
the
question
of
the
valuation
proceeding
because
if
you'll
notice
on
page
2
of
my
brief,
we
have
the
statutory
provision
involved.
and
the
only
section
which
we
passed
--
which
we
brought
up
and
the
only
section
which
was
passed
upon
by
the
supreme
court
of
new
mexico
is
202
which
creates
that
the
commissioner
shall
give
owner
and
lean
holder
of
the
property
sought
to
be
taken
such
and
such
notice
of
the
time
and
place
when
and
where
damages
will
be
assessed.
and
that
is
all
that
section
202
deals
with.
actually,
we
should,
of
course,
like
to
have
a
broad
ruling
that
--
in
the
case
of
a
taking
even
the
legislature
should
not
be
entitled
when
it
deals
with
specific
individuals,
should
not
be
entitled
to
be
free
of
the
due
process
requirement
addressed.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
well,
we
have
them
on
page
5
in
the
summary
of
the
argument
in
the
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
right,
the
questions
were
actually
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
right,
and
we
incorporate
section
202
and
that's
the
only
one
that's
really
an
issue
here.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
we
were
challenging
that,
your
honor.
we'd
have
to
be
challenging
section
201,
which
is
the
proceeding
for
the
condemnation,
which
is
nowhere
referred
to
anywhere
as
in
the
case.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
right.
the
question
may
have
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
i
will
say
this,
your
honor.
we
phrase
the
questions
in
the
petition
as
broadly
as
we
could.
i
think
that
the
question
presented
certainly
subsumes
and
in
accordance
with
the
rules
of
this
court
of
that
section
subsuming
--
certainly,
subsume
section
202
which
is
specifically
referred
to.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
the
contention
has
been
that
the
property
was
valued
and
taken
without
due
process.
actually,
we're
sticking
here
only
to
the
question
of
compensation
unless
it
would
help
this
court,
and
with
my
brother
oswald's
consent,
i'd
be
quite
willing
to
just
say
that
we'll
waive
anything
else
and
just
rely
on
the
constitutionality
of
202
if
that
will
help.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
well,
it
stated
first
in
the
page
5,
in
the
last
full
paragraph,
the
last
four
lines,
where,
again,
we
subsume
that
as
a
question.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
of
my
petition.
i'm
sorry.
this
is
of
the
brief
--
it
was
in
the
petition
to
--
do
you
have
the
petition?
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
your
record
actually
raises
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
26-201
and
202.
you'll
find
that
on
page
3,
paragraph
8.
now,
that
was
the
complaint.
in
the
petition
for
appeal
to
the
--
the
notice
of
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
and
the
specifications
of
error,
particularly
in
the
specifications
of
error,
you'll
notice
that
the
only
error
specified
on
the
top
of
page
23
is
the
court
further
erred
by
holding
202
constitutional,
and
that
202
does
not
provide
sufficient
notice.
and
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
also
sticks
straightly
to
the
question
of
202
and
does
not
say
anything
about
201
which
deals
with
the
taking.
as
i
say,
the
question
presented
was
presented
very
broadly
to
give
this
court
an
opportunity
to
rule
on
the
broader
question
which
we
hope
it
would
rule
the
part.
as
i
understand
the
rules
of
the
court,
the
question
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
or
elsewhere
is
deemed
to
subsume
every
--
to
include
every
question
which
could
be
subsumed
thereunder.
in
section
202,
it's
clearly
referred
to
in
paragraph
1
and
paragraph
2
of
the
questions
presented,
and
therefore,
i
submit,
your
honors,
that
it
has
been
quite
properly
read.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes,
i
am
your
honor.
in
fact,
i
intended
to
cite
that
together
with
the
seaboard
airlines
case
in
261
u.s.
as
holding
that
in
terms
of
the
question
of
compensation.
as
again
distinguished
from
eminent
domain
proceedings,
there
is
a
requirement
of
notice.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes,
it
would.
i
frankly
think
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
right.
i
would
hope,
i
doubt
very
much
that
the
court
would
but
i
would
hope
that
the
court
might
overrule
on
the
question
of
taking
to.
i
might
mention,
for
example,
that
in
--
let
me
cite
an
additional
case
which
i've
just
come
across,
case
of
nelson
versus
united
states
in
208
f.2d
505,
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
district
held
at
page
513
that
the
legislature
was
not
exempt
from
the
requirements
of
the
first
10
amendments.
they
held
that
in
terms
solely
of
the
fourth
amendment,
specifically
that
is,
but
i
see
no
reason
why
the
legislature
is
exempt
from
any
requirements
of
due
process
imposes
when
they
deal
with
individuals
through
condemnation,
i
suppose
to
general
legislature.
i
frankly
think
that
the
prior
doctrine
has
been
an
error,
but
as
i
say,
the
real
item
which
we
press
is
the
valuation
and
that
that
may
be,
despite
the
broad
language,
in
the
questions
presented
might
be
the
only
thing
before
this
court.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
it
doesn't
provide
for
any
notice
to
take.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
i
would
think
that
if
the
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
i
think
if
it
related
to
one
specific
piece
of
property,
i
would
take
the
position
that
it
could.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
i
don't
think
it
can
do
that
without
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
contest
the
question
of
public
use.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no,
but
i
suggest
that
when
a
legislature
passes
an
act
as
to
a
named
individual,
which
is
a
little
different,
it's
almost
like
a
bill
of
attainder
as
to
property
though
i
realize
there
are
loads
of
differences.
i'm
just
analogizing
that.
i
think
when
they
do
that
--
that
then
there
should
be
some
opportunity
to
contest
the
legislative
act
either
a
hearing
before
the
legislature
or
in
court
later
on
a
public
--
in
the
question
(inaudible)
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
we
don't
dispute
that
at
all.
the
only
--
i
was
only
referring
to
notice.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
my
position
is
that
the
question
relates
only
to
damages
and
that
it
can
relate
only
to
damages
in
terms
of
this
court's
jurisdiction
because
the
only
question
that
was
raised
and
passed
upon
in
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
below
was
simply
the
question
of
section
202
which
deals
solely
with
damages
and
does
not
deal
with
the
question
of
transferring
title
of
legislative
act.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
i
think
that,
quite
properly,
i
shouldn't
--
i
mentioned
yesterday,
judge
harlan,
that
i
felt
that
i
would
like
the
court
to
rule
on
that
even
though
i
thought
it
was
not
properly
before
them.
i
still
stick
to
that
position.
i
have
been
drawn
into
a
discussion
of
it
because
it
has
been
troubling
the
court,
but
all
that
i'm
really
interested
in
--
in
pressing
as
i
mentioned
before
is
the
question
of
amount.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes,
it
would
be.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
well
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
let
me
clarify
that,
your
honor.
the
petition
mentions
or
raises
the
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
correct.
now,
i
would
think
that
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
might
well
--
i'm
not
familiar
enough
with
kansas
procedure.
if
i
did
this
in
new
york,
i
suppose
the
court
of
appeals
would
say
to
me,
“your
petition
for
--
you
prayer
for
relief
is
so
broad
here,
your
--
you've
taken
the
wrong
form
of
action
and
if
you
were
interested
in
solely
202,
the
amount
of
compensation,
you
should
do
something
different
or
amend
your
pleadings
or
something
of
that
sort.
but
the
supreme
court
of
new
mexico
here
did
accept
the
case
and
did
rule
solely
on
--
in
its
opinion
and
its
opinion
is
directed
solely
to
the
question
of
section
202.
now,
maybe
they
did
wrong.
i'm
not
going
to
talk
about
that
because
i
don't
know
kansas's
procedure
well
enough,
but
i
submit
that
that
really
is
a
question
of
state
law.
and
they
considered
section
202
solely
under
this
particular
prayer
for
an
injunction.
i've
been
a
little
puzzled
as
to
why
they
did
but
they
did.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
the
original
pleading
was
a
petition
then
--
an
amended
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no,
it
doesn't
appear.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
insofar
as
the
record
is
concerned,
that's
correct.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes,
and
i
suppose
that
could
never
be
found
out
without
the
hearing
with
--
in
a
denial
of
the
opportunity
for
the
hearing
is
what's
being
complained
of.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
of
your
right
the
fourteenth?
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
of
your
right
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
clause.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
well,
again,
your
honor,
i
submit
that
that
would
be
a
question
of
state
laws
to
whether
the
question
had
been
adequately
raised
in
the
state
and
the
supreme
court
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
there
has
--
there
is
a
general
allegation
in
here
that
there
has
been
a
deprivation
of
property
without
due
process
of
law.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
that's
right.
but
the
only
property
that
we
could
have
been
deprived
of
was
the
fact
that
the
valuation
was
not
substantial,
it
was
not
enough.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
well
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
i
would
suggest
that
that
is
actually
a
question
of
state
pleading
in
terms
of
what
the
state
of
kansas
found.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no.
they
didn't
--
they
didn't,
in
fact,
on
the
question
of
pleading,
they
found
that
this
questions
have
been
properly
raised
and
they
ruled
on
the
very
constitutional
question.
they
wouldn't
have
ruled
on
a
constitutional
question
certainly
if
they
didn't
appeal
that
it
didn't
properly
raised.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
in
the
city
of
hutchinson,
reno
county,
kansas,
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
well,
i
think
there
may
be
a
confusion
here,
your
honor,
in
this
respect.
mr.
littooy
made
the
statement
which
does
not
appear
in
the
record
that
this
plaintiff
had
been
--
or
petitioner
here
--
the
petitioner
had
been
paid
for
his
property.
this
does
not
appear
in
the
record
anyways.
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned,
the
record
merely
alleges
the
property
was
taken
without
compensation.
there
is
an
answer
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes,
that
has
been
taken
without
due
process
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
answer
at
all
to
indicate
or
anywhere
as
in
the
pleadings
to
indicate
that
the
defendant
was
actually
--
the
plaintiff
was
actually
paid.
and
under
the
statute,
the
--
under
201,
the
money
may
be
deposited
in
the
city
treasury
and
it
may
be
sent
to
the
plaintiff.
so,
insofar,
as
the
record
appears
here,
all
it
shows
is
the
property
was
taken
away
and
there
is
no
showing
of
any
payment
made
at
all
to
the
petitioner.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
i'm
not
suggesting
that,
i'm
saying
that's
the
posture
of
the
pleadings
in
terms
of
exactly
what
the
record
says.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
we
are
getting
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
i
don't
think
it's
a
full
set
of
assumption.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
pardon?
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
(voice
overlap)?
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
the
money
hasn't
been
paid.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes.
it's
in
the
city
treasurer
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
it
hasn't
been
received.
i
might
say,
also,
just
to
answer
one
other
question
there
that
in
terms
of
the
formal
pleading,
i
suppose
it
has
occurred
to
me
now
that
the
reason
that
the
court,
justice
reed,
may
have
permitted
the
case
to
be
heard
on
an
injunction
action
even
though
the
statute
in
question
wouldn't
have
resulted
in
the
granting
of
an
injunction
if
it
was
done
unconstitutional.
i
suppose
the
reason
may
have
been
the
prayer
for
relief
in
the
petition
at
the
top
of
page
5
of
the
record
which
prays
for
such
other
and
further
relief
as
to
this
court
seems
just
and
equitable.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
of
--
of
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
of
the
court.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no,
the
court
just
discusses
section
202,
your
honor,
which
is
solely
compensation.
i
think
they
frankly
didn't
see
the
difference.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no.
i
would
say
the
answer
may
be
found
on
page
33
of
the
record
that's
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
where
they
hold
on
the
constitutional
point.
in
the
next
of
the
last
paragraph
of
the
top
section,
we
hold
that
the
trial
court
did
not
err
in
holding
202
constitutionally
for
any
reason
asserted
by
the
court.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
right.
now,
your
honor,
if
you
notice
as
you
read
it,
time
--
notice
of
the
time
and
place
when
and
where
the
damage
will
be
assessed,
202
says
nothing
at
all
about
the
taking,
202
is
only
the
time
and
place,
when
and
where
the
damage
will
be
assessed.
and
though
the
court
--
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
mentions
201
and
mentions
202,
it
makes
a
holding
only
in
regard
to
202.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
the
complaint
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
but
the
only
section
here
that
is
involved
is
the
section
about
compensation.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
well
this
is
the
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
well,
all
i
can
say,
your
honor,
again,
is
that
202
relates
solely
to
the
question
of
compensation
and
202
is
the
only
section
that
was
passed
upon
by
the
supreme
court
of
kansas.
now,
i
don't
know.
it
might
perhaps
--
i'm
a
little
puzzled
in
terms
of
the
thoughts
of
relitigation
of
something
at
this
sort,
if
your
honors
here
would
prevail.
but
it
strikes
me
that
the
court
passes
solely
on
the
question
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
in
terms
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
now,
i
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
may
i
ask
mr.
littooy,
if
with
the
court's
consent,
if
he
would
stipulate
in
any
further
proceedings
that
the
question
has
not
been
litigated
and
is
still
open?
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
i'm
afraid
(voice
overlap).
no,
i'm
just
sure
that
the
--
the
court
of
kansas
would
say,
“gentlemen,
it's
section
202
that
we
ruled
on
and
202
is
to
deal
only
with
compensation,
and
that's
what
you
were
in
here
on
and
that's
what
we
let
you
on.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
i
submit
your
honor
that
though
there's
no
express
allegation
in
there
that
that
is
certainly
a
clear
implication
else
the
parties
would
never
go
on
the
court.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
no,
i
grant
you
clearly
that
there
is
not
that
allegation
refers
there'd
be
no
point
to
go
into
court
and
there'd
be
no
deprivation
of
property
if
the
man
had
been
paid
this
full
value.
so
that
i
submit
that
the
allegation
in
the
--
in
the
petition
clearly
raises
that
question.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
but
if
they
were
just
a
question,
if
he's
not
wanting
to
give
up
the
property,
then
i
am
sure
that
the
pleadings
would
have
raised
the
question
of
201
and
would
have
said
that
there's
no
notice
given
at
all
of
any
condemnation
proceedings
of
any
sort
because
--
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
i
--
i
submit
that
the
court
is
bound
by
the
analysis
of
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
which
found
the
--
the
question
of
constitutionality
of
202
to
be
performed.
mr.
herbert
monte
levy
might
i
have
two
days,
your
honor.
