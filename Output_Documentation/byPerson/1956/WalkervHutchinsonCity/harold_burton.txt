justice
harold
burton
did
he
live
on
the
very
premises
that
were
at
issue?
justice
harold
burton
do
you
distinguish
this
case
in
any
way
from
the
court
of
appeals,
the
tenth
circuit
case
in
wichita
involving
the
comparable
statutes?
justice
harold
burton
as
you're
overruling
both
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
and
the
--
and
the
circuit
--
the
tenth
circuit?
justice
harold
burton
the
supreme
court
can
(inaudible)
justice
harold
burton
yes.
justice
harold
burton
but
you
have
to
raise
this
criticism
not
only
to
the
point
that
it's
not
as
the
best
policy,
not
a
good
policy
but
that
it's
contrary
to
federal
due
process,
although
it's
been
going
on
for
generations.
justice
harold
burton
(voice
overlap)
different
if
the
said
two
publications?
justice
harold
burton
we
should
know
that's
not
due
processes
here
in
kansas
under
this
recent
statute,
what
is
put
--
what
had
happened
to
be
old
statute
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
country.
justice
harold
burton
what
had
happened
to
like
statutes
in
the
eastern
part
of
--
of
the
country
that
were
older,
to
point
the
things
between
the
old
statutes
and
the
new
statutes?
justice
harold
burton
i
mean
i
thought
that
you
--
you
made
a
point
of
fact
that
the
kansas
statute
was
not
a
hoary
and
ancient
statute
but
it
was
a
--
a
recent
statute.
and
i
said
if
we
rule
on
the
recent
statute,
you
also
rule
on
the
ancient
(inaudible)
justice
harold
burton
and
does
that
--
did
that
include
the
name
of
the
individual,
(voice
overlap)?
justice
harold
burton
and
i
understood
yesterday
that
this
--
in
this
particular
instance,
this
was
a
well-known
improvement
as
being
made
something
like
a
--
a
sports
arena,
something
like
that.
justice
harold
burton
but
in
this
kind
of
case,
you
have
a
good
deal
of
public
policy
involved
in
taking
the
road
and
getting
underway
if
you
don't
have
any
common
--
common
trust.
