mr.
jeff
davis
if
the
court
please.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
below
is
correct
and
should
be
affirmed
on
either
or
both
of
two
grounds.
first,
the
strike
here
involved
being
an
economic
strike
in
breach
of
contract
was
activity
not
protected
by
the
national
labor
--
by
the
labor
relations
--
labor
management
relations
act.
in
1939,
this
court
in
national
labor
relations
board
against
sands
manufacturing
company
held
that
employees
who
went
out
on
strike
to
force
their
employer
to
abandoned
sectional
seniority
which
were
provided
in
the
contract
between
the
union
and
the
company
and
substitute
in
lieu
thereof
plant
seniority
lost
their
status
as
employees
and
lost
any
protection
under
the
national
labor
relation
act.
in
the
opinion
of
the
majority
of
the
court
in
that
case
which
was
rendered
by
mr.
justice
roberts,
this
statement
was
made.
respondent
rightly
understood
that
the
men
were
irrevocably
committed
not
to
work
in
accordance
with
our
contract.
it
was
at
liberty
to
treat
them
as
having
severed
their
relations
with
the
company
because
of
their
breach
and
to
consummate
their
separation
from
the
company's
employ
and
hire
others
to
take
their
places.
the
act
does
not
prohibit
an
affective
discharge
for
repudiation
by
the
employee
of
his
agreement
anymore
than
it
prohibits
such
discharge
for
a
tort
committed
against
an
employer.
later,
in
the
opinion,
the
court
stated
that
after
the
strike
began,
the
employer
has
no
further
obligation
to
negotiate
with
the
union.
and
it
was
within
its
rights
in
making
a
contract
with
a
nonunion
or
replacement
employee.
mr.
justice
harlan,
we
submit
that
this
court
had
written
a
no-strike
clause
into
every
contract.
now,
when
the
taft-hartley
amendments
came
before
the
senate
for
consideration,
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
sands
manufacturing
company
case
had
the
most
decisive
effect
not
only
upon
the
negotiations
in
congress
but
upon
the
form
in
which
the
amendments
were
finally
adopted.
when
the
amendatory
bill
was
first
passed
in
the
house,
section
7
of
the
house
bill
included
or
added
to
section
7
of
the
old
act
an
expressed
provision
to
the
effect
that
a
strike
in
violation
of
contract
should
not
be
within
concerted
activities
protected
by
the
act.
the
senate
version
of
the
bill
did
not
include
that
provision
in
section
7.
the
two
bills
went
to
conference.
the
conference
accepted
the
senate
version.
the
members
of
the
house
conference
committee
in
reporting
the
conference
bill
to
the
house,
stated
or
heard
the
house
to
receive
from
its
position
of
insistent
that
section
7
of
the
amended
act
include
the
provision
excluding
a
strike
against
--
in
violation
of
contract
from
concerted
activities
protected
by
the
act
stating
that
it
was
already
established,
that
under
section
7
of
the
national
labor
relation
act,
a
strike
in
violation
of
contract
was
unprotected
activity.
the
majority
of
the
committee
in
the
senate
to
whom
the
amendatory
of
legislation
was
referred
in
reporting
the
senate
bill
to
the
senate
made
this
statement.
it
should
be
noted
that
the
board
has
construed
the
present
act
as
denying
any
remedy
to
employees
striking
for
illegal
objectives.

mr.
jeff
davis
no
sir,
if
your
honor
please
--
please.
but
we
take
the
positions
that
if
the
conclusion
which
the
court
reads
is
correct,
the
fact
that
a
state
has
put
his
conclusion
on
an
erroneous
ground,
would
not
call
a
reversal,
the
case
is
nevertheless
--
to
save

the
lower
court
did
not
discuss
that
point.
the
lower
court
makes
a
decision
solely
upon
the
provisions
of
8
(d)
which
we
hope
to
be
able
to
discuss
just
a
little
bit
later.
other
portions
of
the
legislative
history
concerning
the
taft-hartley
amendment
are
cited
in
our
brief
to
the
same
effect.
now,
let
us
look
at
the
record
to
ascertain
whether
this
strike
was
in
breach
of
contract.
of
course
it
was
an
economic
strike.
that
is
conceded.
it
is
also
conceded
by
distinguished
counsel
for
the
petitioner
that
the
contract
was
in
full
force
and
effect
when
the
strike
began.
the
contract
involved,
appeared
at
the
beginning
--
at
page
27
of
the
record.
at
page
67
of
the
record
is
shown
a
schedule
of
hourly
wages
to
be
paid
to
each
man
engage
in
each
of
the
particular
classifications
of
work
therein
enumerated.
the
hour
rates
of
fairs
specific.
they're
set
out
in
dollars
and
cents.
on
the
next
page
of
the
record,
appears
a
provision
that
in
addition
to
the
hourly
wage
for
each
hour
work
as
provided
in
the
exhibit
of
hour
wages
to
which
i
have
referred,
each
man
working
on
the
evening
shift
should
receive
an
addition
7
cents
an
hour
and
each
man
working
on
the
graveyard
shift
shall
receive
an
addition
6
cents
an
hour.
if
we
look
at
page
36
of
the
record,
we
find
the
provision
of
the
contract
which
provides
that
each
year,
each
employee
is
to
be
permitted
six
holidays
with
pay.
now
when
this
strike
began,
it
was
called
by
the
union
and
was
participated
in
by
the
strikers
for
the
purpose
of
forcing
the
company
immediately
to
increase
each
of
those
hourly
wage
rates
by
22
cents
and
to
increase
shift
differentials
to
6
cents
and
12
cents
an
hour
and
to
grant
to
each
man
an
additional
holiday
with
pay.
we
say,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
union
in
calling
the
strike
and
causing
the
man
to
refuse
to
work
in
accordance
with
our
contract,
committed
a
total
breach
of
the
contract
and
a
complete
repudiation
of
it.
that
action
is
just
exactly
what
this
court
has
held.
calls
employer
--
striking
employees
to
lose
the
rights
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
when
the
strike
is
violation
of
contract.
now
let
me
bear
upon
this
point.
there
was
no
no-strike
clause
in
this
case.
there
is
nothing
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
the
sands
manufacturing
company
case
to
indicate
that
there
was
a
no-strike
clause
in
that
contract
but
to
the
contrary,
mr.
justice
roberts
in
his
opinion
makes
particular
point
of
the
fact
that
in
that
contract
there
was
a
clause
which
as
i
read
the
statement,
he
considered
to
be
a
reservation
of
the
right
to
strike
on
the
part
of
the
union
if
there
was
disagreement
between
the
union
and
the
company.
this
court
has
stated
time
and
time
again
that
the
purpose
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
is
to
encourage
industrial
peace.
what
could
be
more
contrary
to
industrial
peace
than
to
grant
relief
under
this
act?
mr.
jeff
davis
if
your
honor
please.
when
i
stated
awhile
ago
the
demands
of
the
union
at
the
time
the
strike
began
are
neglected
to
refer
to
the
point
in
the
record.
there
is
a
showing
that
the
fact
which
i
stated
were
in
accordance
with
the
testimony.
that
testimony
was
given
by
an
international
representative
of
the
union
and
it
appears
at
page
117
of
the
record.
as
i
was
saying
immediately
before
the
luncheon
recess,
we
feel
that
nothing
could
be
more
disruptive
of
industrial
peace
than
for
the
board
to
give
release
under
the
--
relief
under
the
act
to
an
employer,
to
our
union,
or
to
employees
who
have
violated
the
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
effect
at
that
time.
it
seems
from
the
legislative
history
that
everyone
involved
was
of
the
opinion
that
when
a
collective
bargaining
contract
is
entered
into
between
a
union
and
a
company,
that
both
sides
should
faithfully
perform
the
contract.
at
page
1
--
at
page
21
of
our
brief,
we
cite
a
statement
made
by
the
minority
and
the
minority
report
of
the
taft-hartley
bill
in
the
senate
in
which
the
minority
stated
there
can
be
no
question
that
collective
bargaining
agreements
like
other
contracts
should
be
faithfully
performed
by
the
parties.
and
at
page
43
of
the
appendix
of
our
brief,
we
--
appears
a
statement
by
president
truman
who
vetoed
the
taft-hartley
act.
to
this
effect,
as
a
part
of
the
senate
report
on
the
bill,
we
quoted
in
the
senate
report.
we
shall
have
to
find
matters
not
only
of
peaceful
negotiation
of
labor
contracts,
but
also
ensuring
industrial
peace
for
the
life
of
contracts.
contracts
once
made
must
be
lived
up
to
and
should
be
changed
only
in
the
manner
agreed
upon
by
the
parties.
if
we
expect
confidence
and
agreements
made,
there
must
be
responsibility
and
integrity
on
both
sides
in
carrying
them
out.
now
--
mr.
jeff
davis
no,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
jeff
davis
that's
very
true,
your
honor.
we
always
took
the
position
from
the
inception
of
this
thing,
that
this
strike
was
in
violation
of
the
contract
regardless
of
it
having
contained
a
no-strike
law.
the
union
took
the
other
position.
we
were
negotiating
for
a
no-strike
clause
not
because
we
thought
it
was
necessary,
but
because
the
union
thought
it
was
necessary.
and
we
wanted
to
get
a
contract
for
the
ensuing
year
which
even
the
union
would
recognize
as
one
that
had
to
be
carried
out
in
good
faith.
mr.
jeff
davis
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
jeff
davis
as
i
read
the
board's
decision
that
question
was
not
pass
upon
by
them
but
it
was
raised
by
us
between
the
boards.
mr.
jeff
davis
april
22nd,
1955.
mr.
jeff
davis
yes.
mr.
jeff
davis
sir?
mr.
jeff
davis
(voice
overlap)
because
i
suppose
--
because
the
action
--
the
wording
of
the
action
to
me
seems
so
clear
that
anybody
could
deny
that.
mr.
jeff
davis
i
don't
--
there
isn't
in
my
mind,
your
honor.
now,
merely
because
the
union
in
this
case,
made
no
effort
at
all
to
comply
with
8
(d),
should
the
union
or
the
strikers
be
put
in
a
more
favorable
position
in
this
case
than
they
would
be
--
would
have
been
in,
had
the
union
given
the
notice
of
termination
and
then
call
a
strike
before
the
expiration
of
sixty
days.
we
say
that
to
avoid
that
unreasonable
situation
where
in
this
case
the
court
would
say
that
the
union
and
the
men
are
in
a
more
favorable
position
and
if
they
had
given
those
termination
and
call
to
strike,
all
we
need
to
do
is
to
give
an
interpretation
to
the
word
terminate
in
the
introductory
clauses
of
the
proviso
of
8
(d)
which
i
think
is
a
true
meaning
of
it
to
denote
not
only
terminating
a
contract
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
contract,
but
also
to
denote
terminating
a
contract
by
a
complete
breach
and
repudiation
of
it.
now,
if
the
court
were
to
see
fit
to
adopt
that
interpretation
of
the
word
“terminate”
in
the
introductory
clauses
of
8
(d)
which
says,
“no
party
shall
terminate
without
doing
one,
two,
three,
and
four”
to
construe
the
word
terminate,
to
denote
not
only
terminating
a
contract
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
contract,
but
bringing
a
contract
to
an
end
by
a
complete
breach
and
repudiation
of
it
then
you
have
the
facts
of
this
case
fit
8
(d)
perfectly.
if
you
do
not
interpret
the
word
“terminate”
as
including
a
total
breach
and
repudiation
of
a
contract
then
i
frankly
admit
that
8
(d)
has
no
application
in
this
case
at
all.
by
the
same
token,
the
argument
which
distinguished
counsel
for
the
board
made
to
the
effect
that
the
modification
provisions
in
this
contract
applied
and
that
the
union
met
the
requirements
of
8
(d)
relative
to
modification
of
the
contract,
we
contend
that
unless
you
have
a
person
one
side
to
a
contract,
one
person,
a
unilateral
move
which
would
effect
modification
of
a
contract
then
the
provisions
of
8
(d)
set
forth
in
paragraph
1,
2,
3
and
4
never
arise.
the
statute
says
in
plain
terms
that
no
one
shall
modify
or
terminate
a
contract.
so
that
means
--
that
means
action
by
unilateral
act.
in
this
case,
the
union
had
no
right
to
modify
the
contract.
article
1
of
the
contract
did
not
provide
the
modification.
learned
counsel
for
the
board
fall
into
error
in
their
very
statement
of
the
question
involved.
at
page
2
of
their
brief,
they
state
the
question
involved.
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
requirements
of
this
section
at
8
(d)
is
satisfied
when
a
contract
provides
for
negotiation
and
adoption
of
modifications
at
an
interim
date
during
its
term.
now,
this
contract
in
this
case
did
not
provide
for
negotiation
and
adoption
of
modifications.
true,
at
one
--
as
the
first
condition
preceded
to
termination
either
side
could
suggest
an
amendment
to
the
contract,
but
that's
a
far
cry
from
a
provision
that
provides
the
modification.
there's
not
the
slightest
indication
that
either
party
to
whom
such
a
proposal
is
made
have
to
agree
to
it
either
in
the
form
in
which
the
amendment
is
proposed
or
in
any
altered
form.
this
contract
only
provided
in
article
1
and
that's
the
provision
that
control,
setup
a
specific
method
of
termination
of
the
contract.
the
article
provides
that
the
contract
should
extend
for
one
year
and
thereafter
until
counsel,
in
accordance
with
the
procedure,
later
stated.
that
procedure
constituted
four
points,
a
suggested
amendment
by
one
of
the
parties.
negotiation
for
sixty
days
in
an
effort
to
agree
on
the
amendment,
failure
of
agreement
on
the
amendment,
those
are
the
--
were
the
three
conditions
precedent
to
either
party
having
the
right
to
terminate
and
when
those
three
conditions
precedent
have
been
met,
either
party
could
terminate
the
agreements.
we
contend,
if
the
court
please,
that
although
the
provision
of
that
contract
is
unusual,
it
is
not
anymore
unusual
than
section
8
(d)
of
the
act
and
that
that
provision
was
hand
tailored
to
fit
the
termination
provision
of
section
8
(d)
of
the
act.
consequently,
in
this
case
the
contract
was
in
full
force
and
effect
when
the
strike
occurred.
now
going
back
--
mr.
jeff
davis
sir?
mr.
jeff
davis
yes,
sir.
there's
never
been
any
question
to
anyone's
mind
about
that,
your
honor.
and
on
the
8
(d)
argument
in
conclusion,
let
me
state.
that
if
we
are
correct
in
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
word
terminate
as
used
in
the
introductory
clauses
of
8
(d)
which
would
lead
to
a
strike
in
total
breach
and
repudiation
of
contract
being
a
termination
of
it
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
then
it
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
this
case
for
the
union
to
call
a
strike
and
the
men
participated
in
an
unfair
labor
practice.
we
contend
that
if
that
be
true,
the
board
has
no
authority
to
grant
any
relief
whatsoever
to
the
union
or
to
the
