chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
would
there
be
any
difference
between
under
your
construction
of
the
act
whether
an
agreement
had
a
no-strike
clause
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
just
the
same.
it
will
be
exactly
the
same.
we
take
the
position
that
i
--
if
i
agree
to
work
for
you
two
weeks,
it
is
certainly
not
necessary
for
me
to
put
into
the
contract
that
i
won't
refuse
to
work
for
you
for
two
weeks.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
thought
--
i
thought
that
in
these
negotiations
that
you
are
carrying
on,
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
issues
was
whether
you
would
have
a
no-strike
clause
in
the
amended
contract.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
kammholz.
chief
justice
earl
warren
nothing
more.
