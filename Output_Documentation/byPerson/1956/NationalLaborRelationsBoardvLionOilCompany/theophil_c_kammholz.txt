mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
eighth
circuit.
the
question
presented
arises
out
of
a
strike
by
the
oil
workers
international
union
against
lion
oil
company
at
its
el
dorado,
arkansas
chemical
plant.
that
question
is
whether
the
strike
which
occurred
in
1952
was
outlawed
under
the
sixty-day
cooling-off
requirement
of
section
8
(d)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
amended.
the
facts,
if
i
may
summarize
them
briefly
in
the
frame
of
reference
of
the
board's
findings
in
this
case
were
as
follows.
since
1944,
the
union
and
the
company
had
engaged
in
collective
bargaining
and
had
entered
into
successive
contracts.
the
contract
here
involved
was
executed
on
october
23rd,
1950.
it
provided
that
its
duration
was
one
year
and
thereafter
unless
terminated
by
notice
of
the
parties,
of
either
party.
it
further
provided
that
if
either
party
desired
modifications,
a
sixty-day
notice
should
be
given
and
thereupon
there
would
be
bargaining
and
such
a
notice
was
given
by
the
union
on
the
first
date
under
the
provisions
of
the
contract
when
it
might
be
given
to
it
august
24,
1951.
attach
to
its
notice
to
--
of
desire
to
modify
was
a
list
of
contract
proposals,
concurrently
with
the
notice,
the
union
also
sent
to
modification
to
the
federal
mediation
and
conciliation
service
and
to
the
arkansas
commissioner
of
labor
as
is
required
under
section
3
(d)
of
the
statute.
numerous
bargaining
sessions
ensued,
progress
was
made
with
a
view
to
contract
changes
but
by
february
14,
1952,
when
it
appeared
to
the
union
that
the
bargaining
had
bugged
down,
it
took
a
strike
vote.
the
strike
date
was
subsequently
set,
it
was
postponed
three
times.
and
finally
on
april
30,
1952,
a
strike
was
called.
it
was
engaged
in
by
all
of
the
production
and
maintenance
employees
of
the
companies
some
600
in
number
within
the
bargaining
unit.
the
plant
was
not
fully
shut
down.
it
continued
in
operation
with
supervisory
clerical,
technical
personnel.
no
replacements
were
hired
by
the
company
and
bargaining
continued.
after
a
lapse
of
nearly
two
months
with
the
strike
in
progress,
with
some
production
going
on,
specifically
on
june
21st,
1952,
any
bargaining
session
the
spokesman
for
the
union
advised
that
the
union
was
offering
to
return
to
work
unconditionally
all
the
employees
who
were
out
on
strike
and
wanted
to
know
what
return
to
work
schedule
would
be
worked
out
by
the
company.
at
that
point,
the
company
negotiators
stated
to
the
union
representatives
that
the
plant
would
not
be
reopened
and
these
employees
would
not
be
returned
to
work
until
its
contractual
demands
were
met
specifically
until
the
contract
was
executed
for
a
duration
of
at
least
one
year
with
a
firm
no-strike
clause
in
it.
this,
the
union
refused
to
do
and
thereupon
employees,
strikers,
individually
and
in
groups
presented
themselves
for
employment
at
the
company's
employment
office.
some
were
hired
from
time
to
time
but
each
who
was
hired
was
taken
back
on
the
express
condition
that
he
would
continue
to
work
so
long
as
the
strike
continued
and
would
cross
any
picket
line
which
might
be
in
existence
before
the
company's
plant.
bargaining
still
continued.
and
by
july,
pretty
substantial
agreement
had
been
reached
on
a
new
contract.
at
that
time
for
the
first
time,
the
company
advised
that
a
new
contract
was
conditioned
upon
the
union's
withdrawing
the
unfair
labor
practice
charges
against
the
company
which
in
the
meantime
had
been
filed
and
which
are
the
basis
of
this
proceeding
before
the
court.
discussion
sued
on
that
point
and
finally
on
the
31st
of
july,
the
company
withdrew
from
that
position,
and
on
august
3,
a
new
contract
was
executed
and
the
employees,
the
strikers
were
returned
to
their
jobs.
on
the
foregoing
facts,
the
board
concluded
that
the
company's
position
that
a
new
contract
should
be
executed
with
a
firm
no-strike
clause
for
a
term
of
one
year.
in
other
words,
insistence
on
its
bargaining
position
after
the
union
had
offered
to
return
strikers
to
work
unconditionally.
it
was
in
derogation
of
the
union's
bargaining
position
as
exclusive
bargaining
representative
that
the
requirement
that
strikers
take
it
places
that
were
not
to
go
out
on
strike
again
and
to
cross
the
picket
line
was
discriminatory
under
section
8
(a)
(1)
and
(3)
of
the
act,
discriminatory
also
as
to
those
who
were
working.
and
finally,
that
the
company's
insistence
during
july
1952
upon
a
withdrawal
of
unfair
labor
practice
charges
then
pending
was
a
refusal
to
bargain
in
violative
of
the
provisions
of
8
(a)
(5)
of
the
act.
in
reaching
these
conclusions,
the
board
rejected
the
company
contention
that
this
strike
was
unprotected
under
the
act
in
that
the
strikers
lost
their
status
of
employees.
the
company
had
insisted
that
because
these
negotiations
related
to
modification
of
a
contract
and
concededly
went
on
before
the
contract
had
expired
that
under
a
literal
reading
of
the
provisions
of
8
(d)
(4)
of
the
act,
the
strikers
lost
their
status
as
employees.
the
pertinent
language
of
8
(d)
(4)
is
this.
after
the
proviso
reference
to
modification
or
termination
and
the
notice
requirements,
the
sixty-day
notice
requirements
prior
to
modification
or
termination
8
(d)
(4)
reads
as
follows.
that
the
party
who
seeks
changes
continues
in
full
force
and
effect
without
resorting
to
strike
or
lock-out,
all
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
existing
contract
for
a
period
of
sixty
days
after
such
notice
is
given
or
until
the
expiration
date
of
such
contract
which
ever
occurs
later.
the
board
said
that
the
last
three
words
which
ever
occurs
later
encompassed
not
only
the
termination
date
of
a
contract
but
covered
also
intermediate
dates
in
an
agreement
where
the
parties
had
said
in
their
document
that
they
would
or
might
seek
modification
the
court
below
rejected
that
view.
it
asserted
that
a
clear
literal
reading
of
the
language
of
8
(d)
(4)
pointed
to
the
proposition
that
such
a
--
that
a
strike
might
be
called
only
in
the
sixty-day
period
prior
to
a
termination
of
a
contract
and
that
in
effect,
this
statute
does
not
permit
a
strike
by
a
union
in
support
of
contract
modification
demands
at
anytime
other
than
the
final
termination
date
of
the
agreement.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes,
i
think
that
is
the
effect
of
the
decision
below.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
no,
your
honor.
the
--
the
clause
in
this
contract
is
a
bit
unusual.
it
provided
for
a
term
of
one
year
and
a
continuation
of
the
agreement
thereafter
until
canceled
in
the
manner
thereafter
provided,
and
the
manner
thereafter
provided
was
this.
first,
that
either
party
might
give
to
the
other
a
notification
of
its
desire
to
amend
the
terms
of
this
agreement,
a
requirement
then
that
the
parties
bargain
on
those
modification
demands
for
sixty
days.
a
further
proviso
that
if
they
did
not
have
reached
agreement
within
that
sixty-day
period
that
then
a
sixty-day
termination
notice
might
be
given,
in
other
words
a
second
notice.
this
contract
really
has
a
two
sixty-day
clause
as
contrasted
with
the
single
sixty
that
one
finds
in
most
agreements.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
it's
unusual,
yes.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
it
is
a
clearly
typical
problem,
your
honor
in
terms
of
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
i
think
in
the
context
of
this
case,
yes.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
there
was
here
a
provision
for
talk
about
amendment
and
either
that
gave
to
the
union
the
right
to
exert
its
economic
strength
in
connection
with
amendment
talk
to
strike
if
it
so
elected
to
do
or
if
one
may
characterize
it
this
way
to
bargain
with
its
hands
tied
behind
its
back.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
under
this
contract
or
under
any
contract?
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
oh,
i
think
a
specific
no-strike
clause
always
gives
a
contractual
right
to
both
parties
to
the
agreement.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
both
the
board
and
the
court
of
appeals
talked
about
the
requirements
of
8
(d),
that's
what
the
board
decided
the
case
on.
that
was
the
defense,
the
line
of
defense
that
the
company
asserted.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
the
court
below
never
reached
the
question
of
the
unfair
labor
practices
involved
here
because
it
asserted
that
this
strike
was
violative
of
the
law
in
derogation
of
the
requirements
of
8
(d)
(4).
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
well
i
submit
your
honor
that
the
language
of
this
agreement
before
the
court
in
this
case
does
reach
out
and
touch
upon
the
precise
question
which
i
have
been
talking
about
and
which
is
the
question
that
has
been
disturbing
parties
in
this
field
since
the
enactment
of
taft-hartley
in
1947.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor
--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
precisely,
the
same
problem
is
presented
here
i
submit.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
it
is
so
clear.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
that
is
the
point
i
--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
i
think
it
is.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
i
think
not,
your
honor.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
i
think
not.
i
say
that
in
view
of
the
--
of
the
context
of
the
entire
section
and
in
view
of
the
legislative
history
and
finally
in
view
of
some
authoritative
laws
that
has
been
thrown
upon
this
problem
since
the
enactment
of
taft-hartley
in
1947.
the
--
the
problem
here
is
not
an
easy
one.
i
readily
concede
it's
an
extremely
difficult
one
of
statutory
construction.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
i
understand.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
precisely.
in
1948,
soon
after
the
enactment
of
the
taft-hartley
amendments,
a
joint
senate
labor
committee
on
the
labor
management
relations
act
was
set
up
to
study
the
effect
of
this
law
upon
other
legislation
in
the
field.
it
was
troubled
by
the
identical
question
that's
here
before
the
court.
the
committee
of
which
senator
taft
was
a
member
in
its
final
report
on
december
31,
1948
said
this
and
it's
just
two
sentences
so
i
should
like
to
read
it
because
i
think
it
points
out
the
totality
of
the
problem
here
and
i'm
quoting.
â€œreading
section
8
(d)
as
a
whole
seems
to
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
the
act
permits
a
strike
after
a
sixty-day
notice
in
the
middle
of
a
contract
which
authorizes
a
reopening
on
wages.
use
of
the
words
or
modify
and/or
modification
in
the
proviso
and
use
of
or
modification
in
section
8
(d)
(1),
which
is
the
notice
requirement,
and
the
statement
in
the
final
paragraph
of
the
section
that
the
parties
are
not
required
to
agree
to
any
modification
effected
before
the
contract
maybe
reopened
under
its
terms
all
seem
to
contemplate
the
right
of
either
party
to
insist
on
changes
in
the
contract
if
they
had
so
provided.
the
right
of
the
union
would
be
an
empty
one
without
the
right
to
strike
after
a
sixty-day
notice.
the
report
then
went
on
to
say
that
the
problem
was
one
of
extreme
importance
to
both
management
and
labor
and
that
clarifying
language
to
make
explicit
the
result
it
thought
already
contemplated
by
the
section
would
be
appropriate.
in
that
same
day
vain
in
1949,
senator
taft
introduced
an
amendment
to
8
(d)
which
as
he
pointed
out
also,
it
was
not
designed
to
change
the
intendment
of
the
law
but
because
it
was
here
that
the
existing
language
did
not
unambiguously
expressed
the
intent
of
the
congress,
it
would
be
desirable
to
so
provide.
that
legislation
passed
to
senate
but
never
did
become
law.
now,
again,
the
legislative
history,
if
i
may
characterize
it
as
such,
the
total
reference
to
8
(d)
and
the
precise
use
of
modify
as
well
as
terminate
in
the
earlier
sections,
suggest
to
us
that
the
reading
given
this
section
by
the
board
is
the
appropriate
reading.
it
maybe
of
interest
to
note
in
passing
that
three
members
of
the
board
took
the
position
that
i
have
articulated
here.
there
was
a
dissent
by
a
one
board
member
and
the
thrust
of
the
dissent
was
essentially
this
that
the
language
of
8
(d)
is
intended
to
apply
only
to
the
time
around
the
termination
date
of
a
contract
and
not
midterm,
that
it
was
not
the
intent
of
congress
to
apply
it
at
any
midterm
point.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
the
reference
in
the
proviso,
your
honor,
to
--
in
this
reference,
no
party
to
such
contract
shall
terminate
or
modify
such
contract
unless
the
party
desiring
such
termination
or
modification,
and
then
subsection
(1),
serves
a
written
notice
upon
the
other
to
the
contract
of
the
proposed
termination
or
modification,
sixty
days
prior
to
the
expiration
date
thereof
or
in
the
event
the
contract
contains
no
expiration
date,
sixty
days
prior
to
the
time
it
is
proposed
to
make
such
termination.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes,
and
then
finally,
in
the
concluding
language,
you
will
note
that
it
is
provided
that
any
employee
who
engages
in
the
strike
within
the
sixty-day
period
specified
in
this
subsection
and
that
relates
directly
to
the
8
(d)
(4)
language
here
involved
shall
lose
his
status
as
an
employee
of
the
employer
engaged
in
particular
labor
dispute
unless
reemployed.
now,
following
the
literal
reading
of
the
court
below
and
applying
it
to
this
sanction
proviso
of
the
statute
would
lead
to
the
conclusion
i
supposed
that
strikers
who
struck
within
the
sixty-day
period
lost
their
employee
status
but
those
who
struck
later
or
before
would
not
which
i
submit
it
would
be
an
incongruous
result
of
the
--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
the
contract
was
still
alive.
now
the
point
was
made
below
by
the
company
that
this
strike
was
in
violation
of
contract
and
that
accordingly
the
employees
lost
their
status
as
employees.
i
think
the
company
relies
on
the
sands
case
in
which
it
was
held
here
that
a
strike
in
repudiation
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
properly
entitles
an
employer
to
discharge.
we
submit
that
this
is
not
a
situation
of
repudiation
of
contract
but
rather
a
situation
of
strike
in
contemplation
of
the
terms
of
that
contract.
further,
the
--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes,
by
virtue
of
the
modification
clause
in
the
agreement.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
in
this
agreement,
your
honor,
there
was
provision
for
modification
as
the
board
found
and
when
the
--
yes.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes,
and
when
the
employee
struck
--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
and
also
for
termination,
yes.
now,
the
further
findings
of
the
board
as
to
the
unfair
labor
practices
by
the
company
in
connection
with
the
--
the
--
its
relation
to
the
union
were
not
reached
by
the
court
below.
i
should
like
to
make
this
brief
observation
with
reference
to
them.
we
concede
that
upon
a
strike
in
repudiation
of
contract,
the
employer
has
the
right
to
discharge.
if
he
does
not
elect
to
exercise
that
right
then
and
if
he
retains
his
employees
as
employees,
he
must
treat
them
in
accordance
with
the

he
may
not
then
at
a
later
date
as
happened
here
resurrect
the

the
claims

strike

and
say
in
substance
â€œwell,
we
will
take
you
back
but
only
upon
abandonment
of
your
adherence
to
the
union
as
collective
bargaining
representative

only
upon

withdrawal

and
we
will
sign
a
contract
only
upon
your
withdrawal

charges
before
the
board.
those

conduct
of
course
was
wholly

whatever
