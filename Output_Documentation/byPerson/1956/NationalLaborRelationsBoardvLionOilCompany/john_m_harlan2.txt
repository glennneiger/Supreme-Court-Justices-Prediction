john
m.

that
instruction
i
take
it
in
effect
imports
into
every
labor
contract,
a
no-strike
clause
in
respect
to
what
the
contract
provides
for
this.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
give
--
do
you
--
excuse
me.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
this
question
following
up
what
justice
frankfurter
suggested.
supposing
this
contract
had
an
express
no-strike
clause
in
it,
sixty-day
notice
had
been
given
to
modification
and
the
strike
had
not
taken
place
until
after
the
expiration
of
the
sixty-day
notice.
do
you
think
a
strike
in
violation
of
the
contract
provision
would
have
been
also
a
violation
of
section
8
(d)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
not.
justice
john
m.
harlan
possible
construction.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
avoid
some
other
troubles
from
the
act
to
(inaudible).
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
davis,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
pass
on
the
question
as
to
whether
what
was
done
here
was
a
violation
of
the
contract,
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
board
did.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
board
did
not
either,
your
honor.
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
not
either?
well
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
suppose
--
suppose
we
came
to
conclusion
that
the
section
8
(d)
(4)
was
violated
on
the
contract
question,
wouldn't
that
have
to
go
back
to
the
--
or
shouldn't
have
go
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
it
to
rest
over
that
question
before
we
--
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
we
cite
two
cases
in
our
brief
one
a
very
reason
one
in
which
this
court
has
held.
i
think
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
is
correct
regardless
of
the
ground
upon
which
the
court
rendered
its
decision,
the
order
should
be
affirmed.
and
we're
not
yet
ready
to
say,
that
the
court,
lower
court,
wasn't
right
in
applying
8
(d)
to
the
facts
in
this
case.
we're
coming
to
that
point
in
a
moment.
i
will
tell
you
why
in
my
judgment,
the
court
below
put
this
decision
on
8
(d).
they
had
already
reached
that
decision
in
another
case
before
i
went
to
the
court
of
appeals.
so,
it
was
natural
for
them
to
follow
their
previous
decision
which
has
been
rendered
or
some
--
or
shortly
after
this
strike
began
in
1952
and
our
case
was
not
in
the
court
of
appeals
--
oh,
until
i
believe
1954,
it's
been
two
years
i
think.
the
record
will
show
when
the
--
when
the
opinion
of
the
lower
court
was
rendered,
this
is
the
order
--
well
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
ask
you
another
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
--
do
you
think
that
the
question
of
what
the
contract
means
or
where
there
has
been
a
breach
of
the
case
has
anything
to
do
with
the
question
to
whether
8
(d)
is
violated
or
not?
yes,
sir
and
if
your
honor
--
if
your
honor
would
permit,
i'll
proceed
immediately
to
discuss
8
(d)
because
i
do
want
to
discuss
before
my
time
expires.
we
say
however
that
because
this
contract,
this
strike
was
in
violation
of
contract
that
the
board
had
no
authority
or
right
whatsoever
under
the
act
to
grant
any
relief
either
to
the
union
or
to
the
man.
i
don't
care
what
kind
of
relief
it
was.
they
lost
the
protection
of
the
act
when
the
union
called
this
strike
in
violation
of
contract
and
when
the
men
supported
the
strike
by
participating
in
it.
now
let's
turn
to
8
(d).
we
contend
that
this
strike
terminated
within
the
meaning
or
section
8
(d)
of
the
act.
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
the
union
and
lion
oil
company,
which
was
in
existence
at
the
time
the
strike
began,
the
refusal
of
the
strikers
to
work
for
the
compensation
provided
in
the
contract,
brought
the
contract
to
an
end.
at
the
time
the
strike
was
called,
the
union
had
a
right
to
terminate
this
contract
by
a
sixty-day
notice
of
termination
to
the
company.
the
union
didn't
see
fit
to
terminate
the
contract,
but
it
called
the
men
out
on
strike
in
total
breach
and
repudiation
of
the
contract
without
any
semblance
of
the
effort
to
comply
with
8
(d).
now,
if
the
union
had
given
notice
of
termination
and
had
called
the
strike
within
sixty
days
following,
clearly,
the
strike
would
have
been
a
violation
of
8
(d).
now,
we
take
the
position
that
in
this
case
--
