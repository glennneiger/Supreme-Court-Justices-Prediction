is
this
--
is
the
clause
in
this
contract
a
normal
clause
which
terminated
the
modification?
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
confirmed
what
i
suppose
which
is
the
very
unusual
clause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
question
of
what
is
implied
if
a
contract
was
terminated
because
they
couldn't
agree
on
amendment
and
modification,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
must
have
each
term
the
decision
of
the
court
below
or
have
a
specific
court
before
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
mean
by
that
in
the
context
of
this
case?
why
should
i
adopt
the
issue
as
it's
seen
in
the
court
below
and
that
is
the
proviso
that's
been
issued?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
but
suppose
--
suppose
there
had
been
a
specific
provision
in
this
contract
that
there
shall
be
no
strike
until
there
is
a
termination
which
is
within
the
power
or
either
party,
would
the
board
hold
that
back?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i'm
assuming
a
specific
no-strike
clause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
had
a
clause
that
i
have
hear
very
different
with
the
ordinary
labeled
clauses
in
which
the
remedy
for
termination,
the
remedy
lies
entirely
within
the
hands
of
the
party,
the
union
gets
(inaudible)
put
an
end
to
it
which
is
the
normal
situation
where
there
is
a
fixed
time
and
period
though
within
that
period,
there
is
provision
for
renegotiation
but
nothing
is
there
as
it
said
here
whereby
as
the
provisions
for
terminating
and
the
provision
for
terminating
is
within
the
power
of
either
party
by
its
own
will.
why
is
an
implication
of
no-strike
during
the
period
which
they
can
terminate
whenever
they
choose?
there
are
different
propositions
from
what
the
court
of
appeals
is
talking
about
the
law
to
what
you
are
bringing
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
neither
nobody
has
talked
about
the
fact
that
we
haven't
got
here
a
case
of
whether
the
right
to
strike
when
there
is
a
fixed
period
and
that
has
terminated
and
has
not
resulted
in
an
amendment
of
the
outstanding
agreement
whether
then
the
union's
hands
aren't
tied
if
it
has
to
continue
to
strike,
if
it
has
to
continue
not
to
strike
while
there
is
no
agreement
because
that
may
drag
on
and
we
all
know
it
does
often
drag
on
very
long
but
if
they
themselves
can
put
an
end
to
it,
if
i
say,
this
comes
to
an
end,
you
have,
i
submit,
you
have
a
very
different
consideration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
--
my
suggestion
to
you
is
that
is
an
issue
which
the
court
below
tenders
to
which
i
for
one
reject.
that
is
not
the
issue
presented
by
the
record
in
this
case
on
this
contract.
and
the
court
below
discussed
the
question
which
i
think
is
very
important
and
as
to
which
they
could
admire
they
have
the
greatest
doubts
that
the
court
below
is
right.
if
i
got
a
record
here
with
a
specific
labor
clause,
i
can't
expect
it
to
go
to
some
other
labor
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
--
i
understand
that
and
that
is
because
those
are
clauses
in
which
the
contract
automatically
terminates
unless
there
is
a
modification
and
nothing
you
said
about
its
continuance
subject
to
the
will
of
the
parties.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
word
whether
you
imply
a
restriction
against
striking
if
the
contract
terminates
by
full
force
and
then
there's
a
question
renegotiation
and
the
argument
that
you
imply
during
the
possible
renegotiation.
or
whether
you
have
a
continuing
contract
which
--
which
put
an
end
to
anybody,
will
of
the
party
with
which
it
has
not
been
put
an
end
by
the
remedy
which
is
provided
by
the
contract
and
to
which
it
is
to
lean
on
difficult
to
imply
during
its
existence,
the
taft-hartley
act
does
apply.
it
was
a
very
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
point
of
my
question
is
to
discriminate
the
nature
of
the
problem
and
not
to
assimilate
it
to
the
normal
use
of
contracts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all
my
insistence
is
about
and
i
think
that's
important.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
whether
--
when
the
strike
got
on
the
way,
was
the
contract
still
alive?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
say
clearly?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
say
clearly?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
are
no
--
there's
no
argument
about
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
board
counsel
admits
that
mr.
davis.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
board
counsel
admits
the
contract
was
alive
with
the
exact
term
which
you
have
(inaudible)
when
the
strike
was
under
--
was
under
(inaudible).
