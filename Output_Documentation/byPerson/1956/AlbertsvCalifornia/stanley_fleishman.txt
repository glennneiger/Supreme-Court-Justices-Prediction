mr.
stanley
fleishman
ready
for
the
appellant,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
if
the
court
please.
this
is
a
criminal
appeal
from
the
state
of
california.
the
appellant
was
convicted
under
california
penal
code,
section
311,
which
among
other
things
makes
it
a
crime
to
keep
the
sale
and
to
advertise
obscene
books.
the
case
started
with
array.
at
an
appointed
hour,
police
officers
descended
upon
the
home,
the
business
office
and
the
warehouse
of
appellant
and
they
seized
hundreds
or
thousands
of
books
and
pictures,
parting
them
away
in
two
trucks
and
in
a
car.
appellant
was
charged
in
the
exact
language
of
the
complaint.
the
evidence
was
simple.
the
state
proved
that
the
appellant
had
in
fact
mailed
circulars
advertising
pictures
and
books.
and
then
it
proved
that
the
appellant
in
fact
kept
pictures
and
books
to
fill
by
mail
the
orders
received
by
mail.
from
the
welter
of
material
seized,
the
state
selected
some
31
books,
10
magazines
and
an
assortment
of
pictures
and
introduced
them
together
with
some
mailing
paraphernalia
such
as
circulars
and
the
like.
this
was
the
entire
case
of
the
state.
the
trial
court
found
the
appellant
guilty
and
sentenced
him
to
a
60-day
jail
term,
a
$500
fine
and
gave
him
two
years
probation.
in
affirming,
the
appellate
department
stated
that
it
found
that
appellant
had
in
fact
kept
books
for
sale
and
had
advertised
the
books.
the
appellate
department
did
not
consider
the
pictures
that
were
in
the
case.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no,
it
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
it
did
not.
it
merely
said
that
--
that
some
of
the
books
were
obscene
in
its
opinion.
that's
all
it
said.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no,
it
was
not,
your
honor,
trial
by
court.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
would
say
that
it
would
include
the
six
books,
if
anything,
that
the
state
insists
were
included
in
it.
there
are
three
novels
and
three
medical
text
or
works
by
doctors.
there
are
some
confusion
as
to
three
but
i
would
say
that
at
least
the
three
novels
were
found
by
the
trial
court
to
be
obscene
and
the
state
now
says
they're
obscene,
although
the
appellate
department
did
not
rule
on
that,
your
honor.
there's
a
procedural
thing,
i
think,
it's
not
material
however,
to
the
issue
as
we
--
as
we
view
it
because
it's
our
position
that
the
statute
and
our
attack
here,
your
honor,
is
upon
the
statute.
we
believe
that
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
we
do
take
that
position.
we
say
every
book
it
--
no
matter
what
we
have
here,
every
book
is
constitutionally
protected
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
--
so
that
even
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
it's
our
position
that
under
the
construction
of
the
statute
by
our
court,
each
and
every
book
was
not
obscene.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
it
would
be
our
position
that
we
would
be
entitled
to
a
reversal,
your
honor,
if
--
because
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that's
correct.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
then,
we
say
there
is
other
confusion
in
the
record
as
to
what
we
were
convicted
under.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that
is
included
without
our
--
within
our
complaint,
yes.
we
complain
about
that
also.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
under
question
one,
your
honor,
in
our
jurisdictional
statement.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
whether
the
--
upon
its
face
and
as
construed
and
applied
as
what
we
are
talking
about,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
on
page
4
of
our
jurisdictional
statement.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
it
includes
that
there,
it
was
stated
differently,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
it's
under
1
(c).
mr.
stanley
fleishman
"it
is
impossible
to
determine
even
after
conviction
and
affirmance
in
the
state
courts
in
what
particular
appellant
defended
the
law."
mr.
stanley
fleishman
certainly,
there
were
--
we
had
a
whole
due
process
question
here,
your
honor.
in
the
due
process
question
under
(c),
we
had
in
mind
the
vagueness
of
the
statute,
and
because
of
the
vagueness
of
the
statute,
the
necessary
vagueness
of
the
trial
throughout,
it
was
all
tainted
with
the
--
and
it's
all
tainted
because
of
the
essential
vagueness
of
the
statute,
your
honor.
but
that
part
of
it,
in
my
opinion,
was
that
particularly
whereas
in
the
case
at
bar,
it
is
impossible
to
determine
even
after
conviction
of
what
we
were
convicted.
that
was
meant
to
include
the
argument
that
we
are
now
discussing.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well,
i
think
in
our
jurisdictional
statement,
we
did
attempt
to
set
it
forth
fully,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well,
it's
not
a
--
an
evidence
question,
your
honor.
this
is
a
--
a
constitutional
question.
what
we
meant
to
raise
by
the
jurisdictional
statement
was
that
this
trial
because
of
the
vagueness
of
the
statute
resulted
in
a
hodgepodge
as
your
honor
point
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
one
was
that
it
abridges
freedom
because
it
a
vague
statute,
it's
a
sensorial
statute.
it's
--
it's
vague
in
--
in
the
area
of
free
speech,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i'm
sorry
if
--
if
your
honor
didn't
see
it
there.
i
--
i
thought
we
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
as
i
was
saying,
the
appeal
here
is
basically
upon
the
statute.
penal
code,
section
311
makes
it
a
crime
for
anybody
to
write,
published,
print
or
in
anyway
distribute
or
advertised
an
obscene
book.
that's
all
that
said
in
the
statute.
there
is
no
definition
as
to
what
is
obscene.
there
has
been
a
construction
given
to
this
statute
by
the
appellate
department
to
the
superior
court
in
the
case
of
people
versus
wepplo.
that
is
the
authoritative
construction
of
the
statute.
there
it
is
said
that
a
book
is
obscene
if
it
has
a
substantial
tendency
to
corrupt
or
to
deprave
its
reader.
how?
by
arousing
lascivious
thoughts
and
inciting
lustful
desires.
now,
it's
immediately
apparent,
your
honors,
that
this
statute
encompasses
all
books
at
the
outset,
all
books.
then,
a
court
may
in
a
sifting
process
permits
some
books
to
go
as
good
and
condemn
others.
but
in
doing
so
--
in
doing
so,
the
court
has
no
guidance
or
whatsoever
because
we
submit
at
the
outset
that
it
is
impossible,
utterly
impossible,
for
a
defendant
to
know
in
advance
whether
a
book
is
going
to
arouse
lascivious
thoughts
or
lustful
desires
and
if
these
desires
and
thoughts
in
turn
are
going
to
corrupt
the
person.
and
it
is
likewise
impossible
for
a
judge
or
a
jury
to
make
this
determine
--
determination
legally,
they
may
make
it
emotionally.
now,
there
are,
of
course,
a
great
number
of
cases.
this
court
holding
that
where
a
statute
is
so
broad
that
it
may
encompass
protected
as
well
as
unprotected
first
amendment
rights
that
the
statute
must
hold
before
we
ever
reach
particular
application
of
the
statute.
our
first
contention
is
that
because
this
statute,
as
interpreted,
applies
only
to
thoughts
and
only
to
desires
because
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
conduct
that
this
statute
is
absolutely
forbidden
in
total
nothing,
no
book
we
contend
that
only
arouses
thoughts
and
only
arouses
desires
maybe
condemned
under
the
first
amendment.
i
say
no
book.
but
in
any
event
if
some
books
may
be
condemned
under
the
statute,
it's
perfectly
claim
that
the
statute
is
broad
enough
to
include
within
it
books
that
may
not
be
so
condemned.
history
proves
this
under
the
standard
obscene
works
of
the
greatest
work
have
been
condemned
and
with
in
a
great
variety
of
cases.
the
state
concedes
as
much.
they
say
that's
true
but
that
was
of
yesterday,
they
say,
those
things
don't
happen
today.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
certainly,
your
honor.
lillian
smith's
strange
fruit
is
an
obscene
book.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no,
it
is
not.
it's
an
obscene
book
in
massachusetts
which
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
--
had
the
same
standard.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i'm
sorry.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
in
our
particular
case,
your
honor?
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well,
we
don't
concede
anything
is
obscene.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that's
right.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
none
of
them
are
obscene.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that
is
not
what
i
say,
your
honor.
i
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
say
that
the
standard
that
california
replies,
which
is
a
mental
obscenity
statute
which
says,
"that
if
a
book
is
going
to
arouse
bad
sexual
thoughts
that
it's
a
bad
book
and
it's
an
obscene
book
and
that
that
book
may
not
be
distributed."
i
say
that
is
no
good.
now,
it
may
be
--
it
may
be
that
an
obscenity
statute
which
is
narrowly
drawn
and
which
is
related
to
conduct
may
breach
some
material
which
your
honors
think
maybe
controllable.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes,
your
honor,
that's
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that's
--
that's
what
i
mean.
yes.
i
believe
that
under
our
constitution,
the
mere
arousing
of
thoughts,
any
thoughts,
bad
political
thoughts,
bad
religious
thoughts
and
bad
sexual
thoughts,
thoughts
as
such,
may
not
be
controlled
by
government.
now
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i'm
saying
that
we
would
have
to
have,
your
honor,
a
much
narrower
statute.
i'm
saying
that
all
statute
talks
in
terms
merely
of
the
effect
it
has
on
a
person's
mind.
now
--
if
on
the
other
hand,
something
that
your
honor
may
have
in
mind,
it
could
be
tied
in
with
conduct
perhaps
and
could
be
specifically
defined,
perhaps
that
would
be
reachable.
i
have
in
mind
for
example
judge
(inaudible)
and
judge
frank's
test
that
they
set
forth
as
constitutional
requisites.
now,
there
is
much
there
that
may
not
satisfy
all
of
us
but
at
least
it
shows
the
relevant
factors.
you
have
to
have
a
narrow
statute
and
you
have
to
relate
it
to
conduct.
so
far
as
it
merely
touches
the
mind,
it's
our
position
that
we
as
free
americans
have
the
right
to
choose.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well,
then
to
the
extent
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i'm
not
prepared
to
draw
the
statute
that
may
meet
the
test,
your
honor.
my
argument
here
is
merely
that
our
statute
is
so
broad
that
it
includes
what
your
honor
has
in
mind
when
he
says
pornography,
as
well
as
works
of
great
value
that
all
of
us
would
admit
has
to
be
permitted
and
that
if
the
state
may
control
some
part
of
this
area,
it
must
do
it
by
narrower
legislation
than
we
have
before
us
today.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
understand.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
--
under
our
statute
and
i
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
if
your
honor
please.
pornography
means
different
things
to
you
that
it
does
to
me
and
i
can't
answer
that
question
without
--
because
we're
not
talking
the
same
language.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
let
me
answer
it
this
way,
if
i
may,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
there
is
some
material
that
is
so
highly
erotic
that
perhaps
most
of
us
in
this
room
and
most
people
in
america
would
say
that
this
is
so
erotic
as
to
offend
most
of
us
and
therefore,
we
personally
don't
like
it.
i
would
concede
there's
that
much.
but
i
do
not
concede
that
there
is
anyway
where
by
you
or
i
or
anyone
in
this
room
can
look
at
a
book
and
say
of
that
book
that
it's
going
to
arouse
lascivious
thoughts,
lustful
desires
and
corrupt
the
person.
i
say
that's
impossible.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that's
true.
and
i
think
that
the
first
amendment
forbids
that,
your
honor.
i
don't
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
if
your
honor
please.
perhaps,
i
can
clarify
it
this
way
that
insofar
as
the
material
may
offend,
only
offend
unrelated
to
conduct,
the
first
amendment
absolutely
prohibits.
the
second
point
that
we
raised
is
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
the
other
point
is
that
due
process
wise
under
our
statute
which
says
that
you
have
to
incite
--
the
book
has
to
incite
thoughts
and
arouse
desires
that
nobody
can
tell
in
advance
neither
the
defendant
in
advance
nor
the
jury
when
it
has
to
determine
the
question
or
the
judge
so
that
under
our
definition
of
what's
obscene,
it's
impossible.
there's
no
--
there's
no
point
where
we
can
say
this
is
--
this
we
agree
is
bad
under
that
statute.
there
is
nothing.
there
is
no
line
or
whatsoever.
now,
all
of
the
tests,
your
honor,
that
have
been
looked
to,
to
justify,
these
obscenity
statutes,
upon
examination
show
that
in
truth
they
are
no
justification.
the
one
that
perhaps
has
been
resorted
to
most
and
with
less
--
with
the
least,
perhaps,
of
justification
is
history.
when
you
have
an
argument
in
one
of
these
cases,
you
go
before
a
court
and
you
say
"but
what's
obscene?"
they
say,
"well,
obscenity
has
been
defined
so
long.
it's
been
around
so
long
that
everybody
knows
what
it
is
because
it's
been
with
us
for
so
long.”
if
your
honors
please,
i
think
that
history
proves
the
opposite
insofar
as
certainty
is
concerned
because
history
proves
that
under
the
standard,
all
manner
of
things
that
are
--
today
admitted
to
be
good,
had
been
condemned
as
bad
so
that
it
gives
us
no
light
in
terms
of
finding
particularly
in
terms
of
identifying
how
a
particular
book
is
going
to
have
the
--
the
--
affect
that
is
attributed
to
it.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
we
can't
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
you
cannot
determine
it
at
all.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
but
if
your
honor
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
you
can
prove
after
the
event
that
that's
false.
in
this
case,
you
can
never
prove
that
the
jury's
opinion
was
right
or
wrong.
it's
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
not
in
terms
of
arousing
lascivious
thoughts
or
lecherous
desires
or
whatever
statute
that's
being
used.
if
your
honor
please,
let
me
give
an
illustration.
as
i
said,
the
people
--
the
state
said
that
all
of
the
mistakes
were
of
yesterday
that
they
don't
make
mistakes
today.
now,
maybe
this
is
so.
maybe
they
are
wiser
today
and
use
their
judgment
in
such
a
way
that
they
think
only
bad
books
are
reached.
but
i
oppose
this
to
your
honors,
if
the
state
decided
to
bring
a
complaint
against
a
bookseller
for
selling
kinsey's
reports
might
not
a
jury
find
and
properly
under
the
standard
used
that
this
book,
kinsey's
report,
might
arouse
lustful
desires
or
lascivious
thoughts
and
thereby
--
and
thereby,
corrupt
and
deprave
a
person.
now,
if
it
might,
there
would
be
no
way
of
reversing
this
item
because
the
jury
makes
the
law
as
it
decides
the
case.
they
say
it's
going
to
have
this
effect
and
then,
there
is
no
way
of
disproving
it
and
that's
the
difference,
your
honor,
between
convicting
the
innocent
and
convicting
the
guilty
because
you
can
disprove
it.
if
a
man
is
wrongly
--
wrongly
accused
of
murder
and
he
can
prove
otherwise,
then
he
will
ultimately
justify
himself.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
if
your
honor
please,
that's
not
the
standard
we
used
in
california.
wepplo
does
not
have
that
exception.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
if
your
honor
please,
the
standard
that
california
uses
will
be
found
in
the
footnote
on
73
and
also
on
23.
i'd
like
to
save
the
balance
of
my
time
to
--
for
rebuttal,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
if
your
honors
please.
i'd
like
to
come
back
to
a
statement
mr.
whichello
made
in
passing
certain
in
which
he
was
discussing
the
wepplo
case.
and
he
said
he's
only
disagreement
was
--
with
it
was
that
it
didn't
go
far
enough.
and
your
honors
would
--
will
observe
in
the
brief
where
actually
he
tended
to
push
the
effect
of
these
statutes.
now,
i
want
to
in
the
brief
time
left
me
--
left
to
me
make
just
one
single
point.
and
that
is
that
the
state
of
california
throughout,
including
today
in
mr.
whichello's
argument,
has
contended
that
"the
picture
of
conjugal
love",
this
picture,
is
one
of
the
most
obscene
books
in
the
record.
it's
our
contention,
your
honor,
that
this
book
happens
to
be
a
classic.
it's
just
that
simple.
and
any
standard
that
properly
applied
and
the
state
said
that
they
are
properly
applying
the
standards
of
this
book,
any
standard
which
is
properly
applied
and
which
will
catch
with
in
its
net.
this
book
must
be
a
bad
standard
and
unconstitutional
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
--
standard.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
"the
picture
of
conjugal
love",
it's
one
of
those
in
exhibit
5,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
a
dr.venette.
it
was
written
in
1688,
your
honor.
it
was
the
first
kinsey
report.
it
was
the
first
kinsey
report
that
is
being
condemned
now.
i'd
like
it,
your
honor
if
you
please
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
think
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
think
a
narrowly
drawn
statute
addressed
to
children
would
be
a
statute,
which
would
commend
itself
much
more
readily
to
me
and
to
your
honors.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no,
it
doesn't
but
the
--
the
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
if
your
honor
please.
as
--
this
statute
is
not
limited
to
children.
it
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
--
applies
with
a
reason.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
if
your
honor
please,
this
--
this
work
illustrates
to
me
one
of
the
really
difficult
problems
in
this
whole
area.
we
all
approach
it,
if
your
honors
please,
with
a
prejudice.
i
know
it
because
when
i
had
it
on
my
first
case,
i
was
prejudice
also.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
in
this
area
of
sexual
conduct,
we
are
now
undergoing
great
changes,
the
people
of
america.
and
can't
the
people
think
about
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
believe
that
--
that
it's
--
at
least
as
established
as
many
of
the
things
that
are
asserted
as
being
the
basis
for
obscenity
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
but
if
your
honor
please,
these
three
legislatures
doesn't
draw
the
standards
for
obscenity,
the
judge
and
the
jury
draw
it.
and
each
case,
the
standard
is
made,
the
law
is
made
for
that
case.
that's
not
the
function
of
courts.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
if
your
honor
please,
in
criminal
law
cases,
the
standard
has
to
be
more
specific.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
understand
that.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
believe
the
international
harvester
case
says
though
that
when
something
is
not
knowable
that's
a
different
situation.
this
is
not
knowable
in
the
nash
case
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
if
your
honor
please,
i
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
say
the
california
standard
and
that's
all
that
we
have
undertaken,
your
honor,
the
california
statute
which
says
that
a
defendant
must
know
in
advance
that
this
book
of
"conjugal
love"
is
going
to
so
arouse
people
and
incite
such
bad
sexual
thoughts
in
them
that
they
are
going
to
be
corrupted
and
deprave.
i
say
that
is
unknowable
by
everyone
in
this
courtroom.
it
is
unknowable
fact.
