mr.
clarence
a.
linn
thank
you.
counsel
is
worried
about
people
who
had
good
motives
suffering
under
the
statute
at
california.
a
reading
of
the
statute
that
counsel
has
referred
to
it,
every
person
who
willfully
and
lewdly,
either
rights
opposes,
stereotype
and
so
forth.
under
that
statute,
no
person
exhibiting
the
statue
of
hallebardier
or
venus
de
milo
or
any
pictures
of
the
classical
nature
exhibiting
nude
figures
put
under
any
circumstances
to
be
affected
by
this
statute.
counsel
didn't
mention
--
hasn't
mentioned
yet
but
probably
will.
the
chaucer's
canterbury
tales
could
be
prescribed
by
the
statute.
i
don't
know
how
anyone
who
take
in
addition
ancient
or
modern
of
chaucer's
canterbury
tales
and
exhibit
them
lewdly.
it's
just
--
those
are
the
things
that
--
that
don't
happen.
and
they
don't
happen
under
the
california
statute.
the
wepplo
case
has
been
referred
too.
the
case
went
off
on
the
point
that
the
court
had
refused
to
instruct
the
jury
properly
on
the
question
of
whether
these
matters
were
exhibited
lewdly.
then,
in
dicta,
the
court
gave
a
good
definition
of
what
the
court
thought
would
--
would
answer
the
statute.
you
must
consider
the
whole
book
and
its
purpose.
otherwise,
you
have
nothing
to
worry
about
in
the
case.
i
think
--
probably,
the
question
of
definiteness
and
indefiniteness
will
come
up
later.
before
i
come
to
that,
the
counsel
--
there
were
questions
asked
about
the
evidence
in
this
case.
there
was
no
objection
raised
in
the
lower
court
or
here
that
the
evidence
is
insufficient.
no
question
of
that
kind
at
all,
the
question
briefed
and
submitted,
not
with
the
chandler
that
was
exhibited
in
the
new
york
case
and
wepplo
whether
this
statute
such
a
standard
by
which
a
defendant
do
not
know
how
to
protect
himself.
that's
all
there
is
in
the
case
here.
and
also
whether
the
first
amendment
prohibit
all
interference
with
speech.
now,
that
question
has
been
answered
in
the
chaplinsky
case
and
the
quotation
in
a
complete
answer
to
--
of
that
proposition
allowing
the
broadest
scope
for
the
language
and
purposes
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
is
well
understood
that
the
writers'
free
speech
is
not
absolute
at
all
times
on
and
under
all
circumstances.
there
are
certain
well-defined
and
narrowly
limited
classes
of
speech,
the
prevention
and
punishment
of
which
have
never
been
thought
to
raise
any
constitutional
problem.
these
include
the
lewd
and
obscene,
the
profane
and
libels
and
the
insulting
or
fighting
words.
those
which
by
their
very
utterance
inflict
injury
or
tend
to
insight
an
immediate
breach
of
the
peace
is
that
well
observed
that
such
utterances,
and
here
is
the
essential
part
of
that
quotation.
those
utterances
are
no
essential
part
of
any
exposition
of
ideas
or
of
such
slights
social
value
as
a
step
to
truth
but
any
benefit
that
may
be
derived
from
them
is
clearly
out
waived
by
the
social
interest
in
order
and
morality.
a
complete
answer
by
the
late
mr.
justice
murphy
to
the
argument
as
of
may
--
as
to
the
first
amendment
is
included
in
the
fourteenth.
and
then,
we
come
to
the
question
of
definiteness
and
that
matter
was
to
dispose
of
by
honorable
judge
frankfurter
in
this
language.
in
these
matters,
legislatures
are
confronted
with
a
dilemma.
if
a
law
is
framed
with
narrow
particularity,
too
easy
opportunities
are
afforded
to
nullify
the
purposes
of
the
legislation.
what
risks
do
the
innocent
run,
a
draft
of
paragraph,
of
being
caught
in
a
net
not
designed
for
them?
how
important
is
the
policy
of
the
legislation
so
that
those
who
really
like
to
pursue
innocent
conduct
are
not
likely
to
be
caught
unaware?
how
easy
is
it
to
be
explicitly
particular?
how
necessary
is
it
to
read
a
somewhat
penumbral
margin
but
sufficiently
reveal
by
what
is
condemned
to
those
who
do
not
want
to
sail
close
to
the
shore
of
questionable
conduct?
these
are
light
questions
confront
legislative
press.
answers
to
these
questions
are
not
to
be
found
in
any
legislative
manual
or
in
the
work
of
great
legislative
craftsman.
they
are
not
to
be
found
in
the
opinions
of
this
court.
they
are
questions
of
judgment
but
purely
within
the
responsibility
and
the
competence
of
legislatures.
the
discharge
of
that
responsibility
should
not
be
set
if
not
by
abstract
notions
about
indefiniteness.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
i
--
i
don't
think
that
that
language
did
not
commend
itself
to
the
court.
it
was
an
opinion
which
commend
itself
to
me
and
[laughter]
i
take
that
that
is
--
that
is
--
i
won't
say
that
at
--
at
the
straw.
that
doesn't
--
isn't
the
straw
into
the
whole
broom.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
[laughter]
oh,
yes,
your
honor,
it
has
and
i
think
we
all
agree
with
that.
[laughs]
