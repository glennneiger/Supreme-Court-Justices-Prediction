justice
felix
frankfurter
was
this
before
a
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
--
it
may
not
be
material
from
what
you
want
to
argue.
but
is
that
the
only
question
before
us?
are
you
--
put
constitutionality
to
--
aside,
evidently,
you
don't
put
that
aside.
you
don't
--
i
mean
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
on
its
face.
i
gather
from
what
you've
just
said,
you
don't
raise
a
question
that
assuming
the
statute
was
constitutional,
it
wasn't
evidence
justifying
the
conviction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
again
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
understand
that
but
putting
the
constitutional
question
aside
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
assume
the
statute
is
constitutional,
if
you
can
bring
your
mind
to
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
that
conclusion,
argumentative.
assume
that
you
make
any
other
point
that
there
wasn't
evidence
by
which
the
trial
court
could
have
found
that
these
books
were
obscene
within
the
scopes
of
the
statute
as
construed
by
your
court,
whatever
--
it
made
a
construction
maybe
to
make
that
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
and
so
that
passing
or
before
getting
to
the
--
or
not
getting
to
the
main
question
that
you
seek
to
raise,
and
you
say,
we
would
have
to
say
whether
this
particular
book
was
obscene.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
know
what
the
issues
are
here.
you
just
--
you
said
a
minute
ago,
this
is
all
the
material
because
you
say
the
statute
on
its
face
is
unconstitutional.
justice
felix
frankfurter
everything
fall
if
that's
so,
but
suppose
that
isn't
so,
what
then?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
next
question
i
was
coming
to.
that
was
the
bearing
of
justice
harlan's
question
as
i
understood
it.
namely,
do
you
maintain
that
in
as
much
as
there
was
a
hodgepodge
and
no
--
no
selection
that
the
judgment
of
conviction
violated
due
process
because
you
were
convicted
on
no
particular
charge
or
--
or
the
charge
wasn't
sustained?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
suggest
the
reason
when
i
asked
the
particularity
about
these
matters
is
that
when
briefs
are
submitted,
your
jurisdictional
statement
or
petition
for
certiorari
raising
questions,
the
court
then
decides
whether
it
wants
to
bring
out
as
it
brings
the
case
here
all
the
questions
or
whether
it
wants
to
sit
down.
and
that's
why
this
court
has
been
very
strong
against
considering
questions
that
weren't
formulated
on
the
basis
of
which
jurisdiction
was
noted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
really,
mr.
fleishman.
you
think
your
questions
in
your
jurisdictional
statement
remotely
would
indicate
to
consider
anybody.
to
me,
thinking
to
try
and
to
read
it
intelligently
that
you
wanted
to
raise
that
there
wasn't
evidence
on
which
the
court
could
have
convicted.
do
you
think
that's
involved
into
the
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
didn't
say
a
word
about
vagueness
in
your
statement
of
constitutional
questions
presented,
not
one
word
or
intimation.
other
--
in
other
cases
indeed
as
triad,
there
were
those
explicit
statements.
this
appeal
presents
the
following
questions
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
one
and
two.
one
is
that
that
it
abridges
freedom
and
two
that
it
conflicts
with
the
mailing,
then
it
was
preempted
by
the
federal
authority.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
--
you're
now
telling
me
it's
vague.
what
i
am
saying
is
you
didn't
say
any
of
your
jurisdictional
statement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
i
couldn't
see
it
if
it
isn't
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
one
of
the
books
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
say
there
is
no
such
thing
as
obscenity
controllable
by
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
do
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
mean
by
related
to
conduct
that
the
book
must
say
to
whomsoever
it's
addressed
you
go
out
and
do
this,
is
that
what
you
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
you
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
--
do
you
agree
or
disagree
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
pornography?
this
isn't
an
academic
(voice
overlap)
because
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
were
asking
us
to
strike
down
a
statute
which
every
state
of
the
union
had.
and
when
you
say
it
isn't
your
business
to
draw
a
statute
that
would
stand,
it
is
if
i
may
say
so
to
your
business
to
enlighten
me
as
to
what
the
scope
of
--
what
the
standard,
what
the
tests
are
which
i
am
to
apply.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
it
seems
to
me
they
are
going
to
ask
you
whether
you
can
see
there
is
such
a
thing
as
pornography
in
this
world.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
not
talking
about
the
statute.
forget
about
the
statute.
is
there
such
a
thing
as
pornography?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
say
that
you're
here
under
constitutional
provision,
the
due
process
clause
which
may
mean
very
different
things
to
you
from
what
it
does
to
me.
and
which
is
so
vague
that
this
court
constantly
divides
on
that.
the
fact
that
a
concept
may
have
different
content
for
different
people
doesn't
mean
it's
unconstitutional.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
think,
if
i
may
say
so,
you
--
you're
raising
two
different
questions.
i
understand
you,
intellectually
i
understand
you,
when
you
answered
a
little
while
ago
that
near
arousing
of
thoughts
of
feeling,
not
incitation,
now
that's
an
ambiguous
word,
not
telling
me
or
somebody
else
to
do
something
that
conduct
must
be
carried,
not
merely
the
likelihood
that
conducts
may
come.
you
say
unless
the
book
says
on
the
titled
page,
this
is
calculated
to
have
you
go
off
and
commit
federacy
or
something
like
that.
i
understood
you
to
say
that
it's
necessary
to
have
the
additional
factor
of
conduct.
now,
you
say,
there
may
be
books
that
--
to
offend
everybody.
now,
offend
is
a
personal
feeling
or
a
community
feeling.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
conduct.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well,
i
understand
you.
now,
if
you
stick
to
that,
i
understand
you.
if
you
say
that
you
take
the
position
that
no
statute
can
outlaw
or
make
it
an
offense
or
inappropriate
ways
or
ascribe
books
that
have
tendency
that
maybe
deem
to
offend
the
community.
i
understand
you
that
there
must
be
the
additional
factor
of
making
somebody
go
out
and
do
something,
which
the
community
may
implicate.
but
you
can
say
it
may
be
so
offensive
but
then,
it
can
because
once
you
open
the
door
as
to
who's
to
judge,
what
does
and
what
doesn't
offend.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
unrelated
to
conduct,
you
mean
that
the
author
must
indicate
in
pretty
or
ambiguous
way
that
he
wants
to
read
or
to
do
something,
is
that
what
you
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
i
understand
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
you
can't
determine
it
automatically.
you
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
without
formula?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
board
tried
--
wrote
a
book
called
"convicting
the
innocent."
i
must
have
viewed
that
from
time
to
time,
innocent
people
have
been
convicted
of
murder
because
of
misjudgments.
does
that
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
does
that
mean
that's
so
vague
that
jurist
send
people
to
do
electric
chair
or
near
thereto?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
thought
you
just
proved
it
by
saying
history
proved
they
were
wrong.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
courts
of
--
but
highest
courts
all
over
the
place
have
said
that
a
scientific
book
in
--
the
matter
of
law
can't
be
brought
within
that
rubric.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
haven't
told
us
what
the
standard
is.
you
haven't
told
us
a
thing
of
--
except
your
own
elucidation
of
what
you
read
this
statute
to
mean,
namely,
that
a
book
in
the
office
of
a
gynecologist
is
lewd,
obscene
and
lasciviously.
that's
all
you've
told
us,
that's
far.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
stating
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
construction,
the
highest
court,
as
far
as
this
has
gone
in
your
state
have
given
to
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
it's
never
been
before
an
appellant
try
to
do
them
in
your
--
in
california?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
did
the
statute
appear
on
your
statutory?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
they're
not
before
an
appellate
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
--
well,
didn't
they
have
to
--
what
were
the
appeals
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'll
have
to
read
that
opinion
but
i
suppose
if
the
conviction
is
brought
up
to
an
appellate
court
and
the
appellate
court
sustains
the
conviction,
it
must
have
said
something
about
what
the
statute
covered.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
maybe
not
--
maybe
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
found
it
on
the
very
first
page.
i've
just
opened
it.
the
wepplo
say
--
said
it
doesn't
give
the
definition.
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
saying
it
doesn't
--
what
do
you
conceive
the
definition
of
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
was
it
dictum?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
does
--
it
said
something
in
the
second
paragraph,
which
is
from
my
point
of
view,
very
important
since
section
311
penal
code
condemned
the
sale
of
a
book
rather
than
a
part
of
a
book.
do
you
agree
with
the
contention
that
a
book
must
be
considered
as
a
whole
in
determining
whether
this
law
is
violated?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
that
sentence,
it
already
reached
it
one
of
the
most
important
aspects
of
this
problem
and
the
source
of
all
mischief
due
to
(inaudible)
definition
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
they
have
no
definition.
that's
one
of
the
most
important
aspects
of
this
whole
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
agreed
on
the
fact
but
its
significance
becomes
relevant,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
each
one
of
these
--
would
each
one
of
these
items
offered
in
evidence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
separately?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
as
the
offer
was
made
whether
objection
for
each
separate
offers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
we
move
back,
i
read
something
that
you
make
any
endeavor
not
to
reach
beyond
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'll
just
read
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
read
that,
would
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
where
--
where
do
you
read
this
from?
i
don't
mean
the
record.
did
they
put
this
on
the
book
or
in
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
to
whom
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
whom
was
the
advertisement
sent?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
--
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
you
read
from
--
an
opinion
of
mine,
which
could
not
commend
itself
to
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
i
could
cooperate
occasionally
to
make
him
adjust?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
book?
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
--
if
you
--
what
you
would
do
with
the
case
in
which
conscience
is
abstract,
a
careful
abstract
of
the
kinsey
report
is
mailed
exclusively
to
boys
in
the
famous
prep
schools
of
the
untied
states
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
would
you
say
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
fact
that's
a
classic
doesn't
answer
all
the
questions,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
classic
may
has
if
reasonably
brought
out
in
debates
in
the
house
of
commons
that
classic
may
have
illustrations
that
may
add
an
element
to
the
classic
text
and
make
a
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
addressing
myself
to
your
suggestion
that
this
book,
which
--
in
my
ignorance
i
have
not
heard
of,
perhaps,
in
my
undue
purity,
i
have
not
heard
of
because
it's
a
classic,
therefore,
okay.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
i
take
that
as
a
--
as
a
dogmatic
proof
or
scientific
proof.
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
statements
that
are
made
about
what
the
american
people
think
on
sex.
are
those
all
established
canons
that
came
from
moses
to
sinai
by
kinsey?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
where
--
that's
where
the
fun
come
between
the
judiciary
and
the
legislature
comes
in
because
they
are
susceptible
of
scientific
proof.
this
court
doesn't
sit
here
as
college
of
purity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
it
isn't
negligence.
so,
it
is
the
difference
between
manslaughter
and
murder.
so,
it
isn't
sherman
law
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
talking
about
the
sherman
law
case,
nash
against
united
states
where
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
where
justice
holmes
for
this
court
said,
well,
i
suppose
would
put
an
end
to
this
argument
that
simply
because
they're
on
the
risk
of
what
a
jury
may
have
to
decide
doesn't
mean
the
legislature
have
exceeded
the
constitutional
speed
limit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
although,
it's
been
on
the
statute
book
of
every
state
of
this
union
and
of
the
united
states
for
--
every
state
of
this
union
for
150
years
and
on
the
statutes
of
united
states
for
a
100
years
only
is
not
quite.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
just
discovered
that
there
is
no
content
to
it
because
it's
difficult
to
apply.
