mr.
fred
n.
whichello
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices.
i'm
sure
that
as
i
begin
my
first
address
to
this
addressed
tribunal
that
i
share
the
feelings
of
all
the
counsel
who
have
preceded
me
through
the
years
that
this
is
perhaps
the
highest
achievement
that
a
counsel
can
reach
in
practice.
i
wish
i
thought
more
adequate
to
it.
in
answering
counsel
for
the
appellant,
if
your
honor
please,
i
would
like
first
to
attempt
to
clarify
the
issues
as
i
see
them
express
as
best
i
can
in
legal
language
from
the
jurisdictional
statements
and
the
briefs
and
as
best
i
can
together
what
that
counsel
has
just
said.
as
i
see
it,
the
contention
of
the
appellant
is
basically
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
in
any
event
because
it
violates
the
first
amendment,
invades
and
encroaches
upon
the
right
of
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
the
press
because
it
is
so
vague
and
indefinite
as
to
constitute
a
deprivation
of
property
and
liberty
and
a
violation
of
due
process
of
law
for
the
reasons
that
one
cannot
tell
when
he
is
violating
or
encroaching
on
this
statute
by
his
conduct
and
because
prosecutors
and
judges
may
become
censors
by
arbitrary
action.
and
lastly,
that
in
this
particular
application,
the
exclusive
postal
power
of
the
federal
government
has
been
encroached
upon.
that
last
point
in
my
opinion
was
due
respect
to
appellants'
counsel,
and
so
totally
without
merit
that
i'm
not
going
to
spend
anytime
on
it
at
all.
i
would
like
to
call
your
honors
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
statute
involved
here
has
in
its
introductory
sentence
something
quite
important
on
several
of
the
issues
involved
here.
it
commences
with
the
words
every
person
who
willfully
and
lewdly
either
rights,
keeps
for
sale,
advertises
and
so
on.
now,
those
words
"willfully"
and
"lewdly"
are
not
always
present
in
such
statutes.
and
they,
of
course,
post
a
degree
of
safeguard
for
the
defendant
under
due
process
as
well
as
it's
exemplified
in
the
same
wepplo
case
that
we
have
mentioned
in
which
counsel
and
i
differ
as
to
whether
the
construction
of
the
statute
on
the
definition
is
pure
dictum
as
i
contended
it
is
because
the
case
was
reversed
on
this
very
word
"lewdly"
and
that
that
defendant
in
wepplo
was
asked
by
his
counsel
if
he
did
whatever
he
was
trying
to
do
lewdly
and
an
objection
was
sustained
to
that.
and
the
case
was
reversed
because
of
the
fact
that
the
statute
said
"lewdly"
and
the
defendant
should
be
allowed
to
testify
that
he
didn't
presumably
as
he
was
going
to
that
he
didn't
do
it
lewdly.
now,
the
court,
before
coming
to
that
point,
does
use
the
phrase
that
counsel
mentioned
and
to
that
extent
as
--
as
dictum,
as
an
expression
of
opinion
by
the
court,
becomes
of
some
interest,
although,
i
don't
think
it
binds
anybody
because
it
is
pure
dictum.
and
also,
i
think
we
should
bear
in
mind
while
i'm
speaking
of
that
that
it
went
as
far
as
it
needed
to
for
the
facts
in
that
particular
case.
now,
in
that
same
connection,
i
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
it's
been
mentioned
that
that
is
that
the
defendant
or
the
appellant
here,
who
could
have
had
a
jury
under
california
law
if
he
had
chosen,
chose
to
waive
it
in
the
manner
was
tried
by
a
court.
therefore,
there
was
not
at
any
stage
of
this
proceeding
and
instruction
defining
the
word
obscene.
and
it
is
our
contention
that
it
--
that
under
the
presumption
of
constitutionality
and
the
presumption
of
regularity
in
the
lower
courts
that
the
trial
judge
is
presumed
here
and
in
all
the
intermediate
courts
after
the
conviction
to
have
correctly
and
accurately
and
constitutionally
define
the
word
obscene
if
it's
possible
so
to
do.
i
mentioned
that
because
nowhere
here
do
we
have
an
instruction
which
pins
us
down
to
a
particular
definition
that
no
court
in
california,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
has
given
a
definition
other
than
as
dictum
in
the
wepplo
case
as
i
have
described.
now,
i
don't
want
to
be
misunderstood.
i
feel
that
our
exhibits
in
this
case,
very
definitely,
do
meet
that
test,
although,
i
think
we
also
go
further
and
into
a
definition,
which
is
perfectly
proper
under
all
these
circumstances
of
the
word
obscene
even
though
it
was
necessary
in
the
wepplo
case.
now,
i
would
like
to
make
this
point
--
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
none
other
than
by
dictum
in
the
wepplo
case,
if
your
honor
please,
and
that
is
correctly
--
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
not
on
the
definition
of
the
word
obscene,
your
honor,
no.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
only
before
the
appellate
court,
about
three
times
at
all.
most
of
our
defendants
plead
guilty.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
1870,
i
believe.
it's
a
very
old
statute.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
on
the
question,
your
honor,
of
definition,
no.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
well,
the
--
the
wepplo
appeal
as
this
matter
of
the
word
"lewdly."
and
there
--
there's
a
pickwick
book
case
and
one
or
two
others,
but
none
of
them
involved
this
matter
of
definition
as
i
--
as
i
think
counsel
agrees.
i
don't
think
there
has
been
a
construction
by
the
courts
of
our
state,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
well,
in
--
in
wepplo
--
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
--
they
did
make
that
statement.
now,
it
is
surprising,
your
honor,
i
expected
to
find
it
and
--
and
didn't
with
all
the
research
that
i
could
do.
i
would
like
to
make
this
point,
if
your
honors
please,
that
the
matter
of
--
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
your
honor,
there's
a
definition
there
but
it
was
--
by
way
of
dictum.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
because
they
reversed
the
case
for
lack
of
admission
of
evidence
that
the
defendant
was
not
acting
lewdly
and
there
was
not
an
attack
on
the
question
of
--
of
the
definition
of
the
word
"obscenity"
in
any
sense.
the
court
merely
makes
the
statement
in
passing
and
--
and
i
don't
quarrel
with
it,
your
honor.
my
only
objection
is
it
didn't
go
quite
far
enough.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
yes,
i
think
that's
--
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
we
--
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
yes,
i
think
we're
all
agreed
that
these
works
must
be
construed
on
a
whole,
your
honor,
and
not
on
an
isolated
passage,
yes.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
yes,
it
does,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
make
the
point,
if
your
honors
please,
that
the
contention
that
these
works
are
not
obscene
and
have
any
social
or
scientific
value
or
whatever
was
not
made
at
any
stage
of
this
case
until
the
appellant's
closing
brief
in
this
court.
other
counsel
during
the
trial
and
the
entire
record
is
before
this
court,
including
every
word
of
argument
was
made
at
no
time
contended
these
works
weren't
--
were
of
scientific
or
of
any
other
type
of
value.
he
merely
argued
they
were
vulgar
rather
than
obscene.
in
appellant's
opening
brief,
there
was
no
such
contention.
and
in
our
brief,
we
make
the
statement
that
to
give
appellant
his
duty,
he
never
contended
these
things
had
any
social
value.
now,
of
course,
in
his
closing
brief
and
in
his
oral
argument,
he
contends
otherwise.
now,
in
that
particular
regard
without
standing
here
and
quoting
from
some
of
these
exhibits
as
i
would
hate
to
do,
i
want
to
call
your
honors
attention
first
to
the
fact
that
in
this
record
there
is
something
that
is
very
unusual,
which
appellant
asked
to
be
made
part
of
the
record
and
i'm
glad
that
he
did.
and
that
is
an
analysis
that
was
prepared
by
our
office
of
the
exhibits
originally
for
our
own
use.
when
the
appellate
department
of
the
superior
court,
los
angeles
county,
some
in
our
oral
argument
using
this,
they
asked
for
copies
and
it
was
stipulated
they
might
have
them
and
it's
become
part
of
this
record.
that
suggests
which
particular
exhibits
and
which
pages
we
consider
the
most
obscene
and
i
feel
what
was
on
that
basis,
you'll
find
the
decision
was
made
by
the
appellate
department
of
the
superior
court
and
they
do
not
doubt
that
some
of
the
books
were
obscene.
again,
bearing
in
mind
carefully,
that
this
was
a
court
trial
and
if
the
court
found
anyone
of
these
exhibits
to
be
obscene,
the
defendant
is
properly
convicted
so
far
as
that
point
is
concerned.
and
the
fact
that
some
other
exhibit
might
turn
out
to
be
innocuous
does
not
mean
that
the
court
in
california,
trial
or
appellate,
held
that
the
innocuous
book
was
obscene.
i'll
be
frank
to
state
to
the
court,
if
i've
been
trying
this
case,
i
wouldn't
have
put
so
many
exhibits
in.
i
would
have
made
a
more
careful
selection,
but
as
long
as
--
the
legal
situation
is
as
it
is,
i
feel
that
if
anyone
of
these
exhibits
is
obscene,
the
court
properly
found
at
least
so
far
as
this
court
is
concerned
that
the
defendant
did
violate
the
statute.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
anyone.
there's
--
there's
quite
a
number.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
there
are
also
pictures
--
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
--
as
it's
mentioned
in
the
brief.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
considered
on
the
whole,
yes.
if
that
is
done,
then
the
fact
that
there
are
other
books,
which
are
completely
innocuous
and
i
don't
know
why
in
the
world
be
trialed
after
they
put
them
in,
doesn't
mean
that
the
california
held
that
innocuous
book
to
be
obscene.
that
was
the
point
i
wanted
to
make.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
no,
your
honor.
again,
a
part
of
the
record
is
the
--
is
the
--
summary
that
i
spoke
off
which
appears
at
page
13
of
the
transcript
of
the
record
and
your
honor
will
notice,
for
instance,
in
the
right-hand
column
that
we
have
indicated
that
of
exhibit
5,
the
book
called
"petting"
as
an
erotic
exercise,
the
picture
of
conjugal
love,
questions
and
answers
about
oragenital
contacts
are
very
obscene.
we
indicate
the
page
numbers,
pages
17
and
19
and
page
24.
now,
of
course,
again
as
we've
said
to
--
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
the
prosecutor
who,
of
course,
points
out
wherein
he
thinks
his
evidence
sustained
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
with
the
presumption
of
regularity,
which
always
prevails
on
appeal
that
we
would
have
to
presume
that
the
court
found
whatever
this
court
finds
to
be
obscene
to
have
been
obscene.
may
i
make
this
one
enlargement
on
that
point?
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
well,
would
--
would
--
surely,
your
honor,
it
wouldn't
feel
that
we
should
presume
the
court
made
a
mistake.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
very
definitely,
your
honor.
otherwise,
we
have
no
presumption
of
regularity
at
all.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
yes,
your
honor.
but
in
a
criminal
case,
of
course,
the
court
draws
no
findings.
he
simply
speaks
at
the
end
and
he
says
he
finds
the
defendant
guilty.
now,
even
if
earlier
in
the
trial,
he
made
remarks
to
the
contrary
about
one
of
these
exhibits
as
counsel
makes
the
point,
his
verdict
where
he
finds
the
defendant
guilty
is
the
thing
that
speaks
the
loudest.
and
the
presumption
of
regularity
we
feel,
it's
at
least
our
contention,
is
such
that
if
any
of
these
exhibits
considered
as
a
unit
on
the
whole
are
obscene.
we've
indicated
the
ones
we
think
so.
then,
so
far
as
that
point
is
concerned,
the
conviction
is
proper
so
far
as
this
court
is
concerned.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
no,
they
are
grouped.
for
instance,
exhibit
5
includes
nine
books.
they
were
--
they
were
offered
in
evidence
and
received
in
groups,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
no,
there
were
--
the
only
objection
was
to
one
letter
which
is
exhibit
17
and
that
was
admitted
for
a
limited
purpose
only,
and
bear
in
mind
there
was
no
jury.
that
was
the
only
exhibit
that
was
objected
too
at
the
trial.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
no,
your
honor.
i
think
one.
i
think
they
were
all
shipped
here
from
the
appellate
department
of
the
superior
court
as
a
bunch
and
i
haven't
seen
them
here
but
i
assume
that's
the
situation.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
i
beg,
your
honor,
pardon?
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
well,
i
--
i
might
suggest
this,
your
honor.
if
you
start
with
the
pages
indicated
by
the
prosecution,
at
least
you
have
a
lead
as
to
whether
there's
anything
that
might
be
obscene
--
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
--
but
on
the
--
the
version
of
--
of
considering
--
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
under
the
appraisal
on
the
whole,
well,
that's
all
one
can
do.
i
--
i
couldn't
take
the
time
to
read
it
all
to,
your
honor,
here.
[laughs]
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
well,
of
course,
they
--
they
vary
in
pages.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
maybe
a
couple
of
hundred
in
some
instances,
something
like
that.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
yes,
i
--
i
can
understand
that.
i'm
afraid
this
will
take
longer
than
any
movie
i
ever
attended
[laughter]
but
i
--
i
think
the
way
you
escape
it
in
view
of
the
rule
of
construction
on
the
whole.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
oh,
no,
your
honor,
no
indeed.
again,
referring
to
page
13.
exhibit
5
has
three
items
that
we
consider
very
obscene.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
no,
your
honor.
other
exhibits,
exhibit
6,
for
instance,
is
moderately
obscene.
exhibit
9
is
very
obscene
and
so
on
down
the
column.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
[laughter]
well,
that
gets
back
to
the
whole
somatic
question,
what
is
obscenity,
your
honor.
and
--
and
may
i
answer
that
by
taking
just
a
moment
to
say
this.
i
think
all
this
business
about
the
term
being
vague
even
as
judge
frank
says,
exquisitely
vague
is
a
complete
somatic
misunderstanding.
i
think
it
confuses
the
proposition
that
some
things
are
hard
to
tell
on
borderline
cases
with
basic
vagueness
or
--
or
indefiniteness.
now,
there's
a
very
fine
illustration
of
that
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief
in
this
case.
he
said
"if
you
take
a
motion
picture"
such
as
justice
douglas
mentioned
a
moment
ago
which
starts
off
innocuously,
as
all
such
pictures
do
that
i've
seen
and
ends
up
with
something
that
is
so
obscene
that
even
mr.
fleishman
would
agree
that
it
was
obscene.
there
is
a
point
in
the
frames
on
that
motion
picture
where
it
passes
the
line
and
becomes
obscene.
there
--
there
can
be
no
question
about
that.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
exactly.
there
would
be
endless
debate
as
to
just
which
frame
but
we
would
certainly
arrive
at
a
point
eventually
where
everyone
would
agree.
now,
where
there
is
a
suggested
application
to
a
frame
about
which
one
differs,
that
is
one
question.
but
when
the
--
the
evidence
is
--
is
very
clear,
then
there's
no
problem
at
all
and
that
is
indefiniteness.
every
man
on
the
street
knows
what
obscenity
is.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
i
beg
your
pardon.
pardon,
if
i
didn't
--
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
i
thought
it
did.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
i
maybe
wrong.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
i'm
very
sorry
if
i
did.
now,
if
the
court
please,
i
would
--
i
have
five
minutes
more
and
i
would
like
very
much
to
do
this
because
it
answers
a
number
of
these
contentions
by
the
appellant.
and
that
is
to
read
extracts
from
his
advertisements
that
are
in
evidence.
bearing
in
mind
that
certain
pictures
sent
out
to
gynecologist
for
their
library
would
not
be
obscene
and
the
same
picture
was
sent
to
high
school
boys,
obviously,
would
by
almost
any
reasonable
person's
definition.
here's
how
he
advertises
his
words
that
he
know
says
have
scientific
value.
then,
by
bigots
who
cannot
stand
the
meaning
of
the
word
"sex"
but
available
to
you
if
you
hurry.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
i
--
i
am
reading
at
the
moment
from
page
87
of
the
transcript
of
the
record
which
is
a
summary
by
the
trial
court
of
exhibit
3,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
i
think
that
would
be
debatable,
your
honor,
in
that
case.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
another
reads,
note,
we
make
every
possible
effort
to
prevent
these
books
from
reaching
young
people
or
persons
who
had
used
them
for
fulfillment
of
indecent
desires.
another,
wild
french
cartoons,
you'll
giggle,
you'll
gas
and
you'll
pop
an
eyebrow.
for
these
are
the
no
holds
by
frenchie
cartoons
you've
heard
so
much
about.
then
another
one,
french
love
stories,
racing
and
risky
is
only
the
french
know
how.
and
i'll
submit
to
your
honors
that
that
is
not
directed
at
scientific
investigators
or
anybody
with
any
serious
interest
in
that
matter
is
obviously
aimed
only
at
the
prurient
and
it
is
within
the
entire
scoop
of
the
appellant's
activities
as
--
as
reflected
by
this
record
that
we
must
judge
it.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
yes,
that
part
of
the
advertising,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
yes,
included
with
these
other
sentences
and
construed
on
the
whole.
it
is
obviously
--
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
--
an
attempt
to
be
inviting.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
yes,
your
honor,
"no,
we
make
every
possible
effort
to
prevent
these
books
from
reaching
young
people
or
persons
who
would
use
them
for
the
fulfillment
of
indecent
desire."
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
that
is
--
that
is
a
--
an
advertising
letter
that
the
court
is
referring
to
which
i
think
is
a
part
of
peoples
exhibit
3
--
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
--
and
it's
certainly
an
evidence.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
the
--
the
mailing
list
picked
out
were
--
were
simply
names
and
addresses
all
over
the
country,
if
your
honor
please.
i
--
i
can
certainly
say
they
weren't
confined
the
doctor
or
medical
men
or
anything
of
that
sort.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
i
--
nothing
said
as
to
the
age,
if
your
honor
please,
on
the
mailing
list
and
--
and
what
that
effort
is,
of
course,
i
don't
think
it
existed.
my
interpretation
to
that
in
the
entire
picture
is
that,
again,
it
say,
“come
on,
send
for
these
things
because
they
are
--
to
that
degree
indecent.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
yes,
exactly.
and
one
other
thing
i
want
to
call
your
honors
attention
to
is
that
there
are
pseudo
masochistic
things
here
in
the
form
of
cartoons
that
on
the
barest
glance
indicate
no
possible
or
other
purpose
than
to
interest
sexual
perverts
of
that
type
and
seeing
activity
of
that
sort
in
the
form
of
cartoons
and
couldn't
have
the
slightest
social
or
educational
value
to
anybody,
anywhere,
anytime.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
on
page
5
of
the
transcript
of
record,
your
honor?
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
on
page
13.
yes
--
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
--
your
honor.
i
--
i
would
say
that
the
--
questions
and
answers
about
oragenital
contacts
--
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
that's
under
exhibit
5,
item
1,
2,
3,
4
down.
exhibit
--
yes,
it's
advertised
in
exhibit
3
by
the
way
which
is
one,
which
i
just
read
from
which
indicates
it
was
not
directed
of
any
scientific
investigator
of
any
kind.
mr.
fred
n.
whichello
yes,
the
name
of
the
particular
book
is
"questions
and
answers
about
oragenital
contacts."
now,
may
i
say
just
one
very
brief
word
about
this?
appellant's
brief
and
many
of
the
opinions
in
this
case
is
construing
similar
statutes
to
this.
it
seemed
concern
entirely
with
people
who
like
these
items
and
who
sent
for
them
and
who
are
erotically
aroused
by
them.
i
want
to
submit
to
this
court
that
i
have
set
forth
in
my
brief
six
classes
of
people
that
i
don't
think
are
ever
any
moral
danger
of
being
aroused
by
these
things
but
whose
disgust
and
reaction
of
this
pleasure
is
something
entitled
of
protection
of
the
state
under
the
police
power
that
this
in
considering
the
--
the
social
value
of
these
materials
compared
briefs
to
free
speech,
this
short
--
court
should
consider
these
classes
of
people
who
do
not
like
these
things,
who
are
disgusted
by
them
and
in
the
case
of
little
children
who
are
terrified
by
them.
as
we
mentioned
in
our
brief,
it's
a
common
experience
with
every
prosecutor
whoever
prosecuted
criminal
cases.
that
one
little
girl
there
are
shown
of
obscene
pictures
by
sex
criminals
are
the
preliminary
step
to
their
crime
and
it
happens
literally
every
week
in
the
courts,
the
invariable
reactions
of
that
child
is
far
from
being
erotic
or
being
any
danger
to
make
her
immoral.
she
is
simply
terrified.
and
we'll
submit
that
under
those
circumstances,
those
class
of
people
should
be
considered
by
this
court.
now,
the
rest
of
the
time
is
reserved
for
mr.
clarence
linn,
a
distinguished
assistant
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
california.
thank
you,
your
honor.
