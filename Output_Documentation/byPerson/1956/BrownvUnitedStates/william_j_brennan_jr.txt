justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
crockett,
i
wonder
how
far
you've
carried
that.
suppose
you
have
an
automobile
collision
here
in
the
district
and
one
driver
was
killed.
and
the
other
driver
was
injured
and
he
sued
the
estate
of
the
deceased
driver
and
they
brought
for
--
on
grounds
of
negligence.
injured
driver
takes
the
stand
and
he
tells
all
about
what
the
deceased
driver
does
and
it
makes
out
a
case
of
negligence.
on
cross-examination,
he
asked
questions
which
go
to
what
he
did
leading
to
the
action.
he
pleads
the
fifth
amendment
on
the
ground
that
since
the
other
driver
was
killed,
he
might
be
prosecuted
for
automobile
death?
could
he
get
his
case
to
the
jury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
those
are
the
facts.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
he
could
have
a
recovery
if
the
jury
gave
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
again
with
--
what
i
intended
to
say
in
the
question
was
that
the
cross-examiner
want
to
interrogate
as
to
the
plaintiff's
conduct
at
the
time
to
establish
for
example
a
defense
of
contributory
negligence
to
defeat
the
plaintiff's
claim?
now
the
questions
we
deal
with
what
the
plaintiff
was
doing
in
driving
the
automobile
just
prior
to
the
time
of
the
accident
and
the
plaintiff
says,
“no,
i
plead
the
fifth
amendment
on
the
grounds
that
if
i
answer
what
i
was
doing,
i
may
expose
myself
to
a
prosecution
for
automobile
death.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
all
he
had
done
--
all
the
plaintiff
had
done
was
testify
to
what
the
defendant
had
done
and
--
or
rather
the
deceased
driver
had
done
and
in
that
way
had
made
out
a
case
of
negligence
against
the
deceased
driver.
but
on
cross-examination
in
support
of
being
no
other
witnesses
to
the
accident,
the
estate
of
the
deceased
driver
wanted
to
establish
that
the
plaintiff
have
been
guilty
to
contributory
negligence
for
example.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
still
go
to
the
jury
on
the
claim
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
still
go
to
the
jury
on
the
question
of
the
liability
of
the
estate
of
the
deceased
driver.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
is
that
--
is
that
so
with
the
dealing
with
the
party,
mr.
spritzer?
is
that
limitation
on
cross-examination?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
he
opened
up
in
an
essence
to
the
--
the
subject
matter
was
her
denaturalization,
wasn't
it?
and
she
took
the
stand
in
her
own
defense
and
without
regard
to
her
testimony
on
direct
ordinarily
isn't
the
rule
that
when
the
party
takes
the
stand,
anything
germane
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
suit
is
a
proper
field
of
cross-examination?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me,
you
bother
me
about
when
you
keep
using
--
calling
her
witness.
she
is
an
adversary
party.
this
is
an
adversary
proceeding,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
she
is
adverse
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
when
she
takes
the
stand
in
her
own
case
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
her
own
defense
--
she
is
not
--
she
is
a
very
different
person,
ordinary
witness
in
that
proceeding
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
isn't
she?
she
is
a
party.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
ordinarily
as
a
party,
if
she
takes
the
stand,
she
has
to
answer
all
questions
whether
they
are
related
to
her
direct
or
not,
does
she
not,
bearing
upon
the
issue
for
decision
in
that
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
state
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
the
federal
case,
was
it
tried?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
well
then
that
goes
the
full
length,
doesn't
it
of
saying
really
consenting
to
be
sworn
and
taking
the
stand
without
regard
though
of
any
questions
that
maybe
asked
is
automatically
the
waiver?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
language
you've
just
read
us
as
i
heard
you
read
it
struck
me
as
going
into
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
first
name?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
is
that
on
the
approach
that
in
effect
his
--
all
of
his
testimony
would
be
stricken
so
that
in
that
case
he
had
no
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i'm
wondering
--
i'm
wondering
why
we
have
to
go
so
far
the
contempt
proceeding
as
was
done
here.
why
must
--
not
have
been
sufficient
in
this
instance
merely
to
strike
all
of
her
testimony
assuming
she
could
not
properly
rely
on
the
--
on
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
yet
she
was
also
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
why
--
why
then
also
visit
upon
her
the
penalty
of
contempt?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
the
second
one
before
us
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
punishment
was
she
given?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
punishment
was
she
given?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
pretty
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
pretty
severe,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
does
the
government
throw
a
distinction
in
the
rule
between
an
ordinary
witness
and
a
party
witness
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
suggest
that
a
distinction
should
be
drawn?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
--
then
do
i
understand
the
government
has
no
quarrel
with
those
cases
you
told
us,
the
ordinary
witness,
they
must
before
there's
waiver,
have
been
an
answer
of
some
--
some
criminating
facts
by
the
ordinary
witness
before
there
is
a
waiver?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
the
case
of
the
party
witness,
whether
or
not
there
has
been
any
testimony
by
the
party
of
a
criminating
fact,
the
mere
fact
that
taking
the
stand
and
testifying
in
support
of
the
party's
own
cause
is
itself
a
waiver?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
still
don't
understand
why
you
make
that
limitation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
on
the
event,
i
guess
you're
telling
me
the
case
before
us
is
one
that
which
the
cross-examination
concern
the
matter
opened
up
by
the
party
on
direct
exam.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
spritzer,
if
obstruction
is
an
element,
assume
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
assume
obstruction
is
an
element
of
a
contempt
in
the
presence
of
the
court
and
that
disobedience
of
this
kind
of
an
order,
his
misbehavior
on
the
presence
of
the
court,
what's
your
comment
whether
there
is
obstruction
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
--
i'm
asking
you
would
assume
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
disobedience
of
these
directions
to
answer,
we
were
to
conclude
is
misbehavior
in
the
presence
of
the
court.
assume
that.
i
know
that's
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
that's
not
the
government's
position,
that's
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
it
is,
what's
your
comment
whether
obstruction
appears
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
fact
--
the
fact
is
in
this
instance
though,
i
gather,
that
the
trial
judge
did
disregard
this
lady's
direct
testimony
and
enter
judgment
for
the
government,
the
judgment
that
the
government
thought.
so
that
in
that
sense,
the
object
of
the
proceeding
was
not
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
--
as
i
get
it,
then
your
answer
is
that
the
obstruction
that's
contemplated
as
obstruction
to
the
administration
of
justice
not
necessarily
an
obstruction
in
a
sense
of
a
frustration
in
a
given
result
in
a
particular
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
say
that,
mr.
spritzer,
if
the
direction
would
answer
what
everyone
could
agree
was
wholly
irrelevant
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
is
always
open
to
one
convicted
of
contempt
not
withstanding
his
refusal
to
obey
or
order
to
answer
an
irrelevant
question
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
have
that
conviction
upset
if
he
can
establish
that
it
wasn't
irrelevant.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
spritzer,
are
you
going
to
say
a
word
on
the
verdict
of
the
sentence?
