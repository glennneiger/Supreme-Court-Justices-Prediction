i
didn't
understand
just
exactly
what
you
(inaudible)
to
mr.
justice
brennan
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
could
say
that
in
effect,
if
she
refused
to
testify
has
amounted
to
the
lost
of
her
case,
what
did
you
mean
by
that,
her
--
that
the
denaturalization
proceedings
were
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
in
this
case
supposed
instead
of
refusing
to
answer,
she
just
withdrawn
to
answer
the
question,
she
just
withdrawn
to
answer
and
said,
“i'm
not
(inaudible)”
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

for
contempt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
interest
would
the
government
have
had
had
she
--
for
her
declining
to
answer
if
--
except
that
it
was
trying
to
denaturalize
her
if
she
refused
to
testify
in
behalf
of
herself.
the
government
could
take
as
judgment,
i
suppose.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
--
suppose
she
had
simply
withdrawn
her
answer,
what
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
her
answer
--
the
proceeding
was
against
her,
was
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
the
government?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
she
filed
an
answer
to
it.
justice

black
(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
my
fault.
suppose
she
had
withdrawn.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
she
didn't
file
an
answer,
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
had
a
case
on
that
several
years
ago,
is
that
what
we
have?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
held
--
had
to
prove
that
even
though
it
was
not
contested.
justice
hugo
l.
black
she
had
not
testified
at
all.
i
assume
she
could
not
have
been
asked
any
of
these
questions.
justice
hugo
l.
black
had
a
right
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
district
court
make
a
finding
on
whether
she
had
waived
within
that
manner?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
have
here,
didn't
it,
a
case
by
the
district
court
did
not
hold
somewhat
the
witness
said
and
as
of
here
and
so
forth
that
the
witness
had
waived
by
what
she
said.
but
the
court
of
appeals
did,
on
its
own
motion,
take
that
position.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
--
excuse
me.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
just
wanted
to
ask.
i
asked
you
if
you
--
what
is
the
ordinary
procedure
taken
in
several
cases
in
state
courts
and
federal
court,
one
of
both,
where
a
party-plaintiff
refuses
to
answer
questions?
are
there
any
cases
where
they
have
been
cited
for
contempt
that
you
know
of
and
tried
for
contempt
or
is
the
practice
to
render
judgment
by
default
dismissed
that
cause
of
action
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
deny
him
relief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
was
it
--
what
was
the
type
of
testimony
in
hovey
versus
elliot,
the
type
of
reason
which
caused
the
court
the
hold
the
sentence
or
what
the
relief
has?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
government
has
achieved
its
end
here,
has
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
the
remedy
given
a
defendant
under
the
federal
rules
where
discovery
is
sort
of
the
plaintiff
and
the
plaintiff
refuses
to
make
the
discovery,
do
you
know?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
general
rule
in
the
state
which
provides
for
discovery
about
what
we
call
interrogatories
that
are
filed
to
the
plaintiff
if
he
doesn't
answer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
when
the
government
attended
for
the
cause
--
cross-examination
in
the
beginning,
defendant's
counsel
has
said
--
said
what
he
did,
“i
would
postpone
my
cross
or
my
cross-examinations
with
this
witness
until
later,
and
then
he
had
taken
up
the
cross-examination
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
though
she
had
been
brought
in
against
her
will
in
the
beginning?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
scope
of
it
was
in
the
beginning
that
the
government
was
trying
to
get
something
to
show
certain
fact
(inaudible)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
he
called
her
and
held
at
the
state
to
stand
on
that
basis.
and
naturally,
she
had
to
say
something
(inaudible)
and
you
say
that
when
she
did
say
something,
that
owned
up
the
government
to
cross-examine
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
that
made
a
voluntary
witness.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
ask
any
questions
--
did
he
ask
any
questions
that
the
government
--
refuse
to
answer
the
government?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
but
did
he
ask
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
those
questions
whether
she's
been
a
member
during
the
period
the
government
has
asked
and
she
declined
to
answer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
had
the
government
asked
her
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
had
the
government
asked
her
that
and
that
she
declined
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
these
the
only
questions
that
you
say
--
that
you
referred
me
to
in
which
you
claim
that
she
refused
to
answer
questions
that
she
--
concerning
a
subject
that
she
had
testified
to
voluntarily?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you
have
nothing
stronger
than
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
isn't
the
argument
you've
just
made
as
to
the
automatic
obstruction
of
justice
just
as
applicable
in
the
case
of
a
perjury?
i've
just
read
the
charge
against
michael
opinion
and
i
see
--
it
seems
to
me
they
made
about
the
argument
you're
making.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
a
criminal
law
not
clearly
applicable
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
contempt
is
statute
to
the
crime,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
would
the
statute
--
with
the
statute,
i'm
not
talking
about,
i'm
talking
about
detention.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
could
--
they
--
they
could
be
tried
like
any
other
person
before
a
jury
with
indictment,
couldn't
it,
under
the
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
when
they
tried
him
with
contempt
of
congress,
is
there
any
difference
between
that
kind
of
trial
and
this
kind
of
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
i
mean
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
there
any
difference
in
the
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
difference
in
the
way
the
two
trials
have
to
function?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
congress
for
failure
to
answer
question
for
congressional
committee
on
the
court.
the
point
i
was
getting
at
was
you
said
it
in
perjury,
that's
a
clear
way
to
try
the
person
in
an
ordinary
criminal
trial,
and
why
isn't
that
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then,
now,
i
would
take
it
a
little
bit
different
as
to
100
to
383.
i
don't
get
what
you
do
from
that
in
the
first
place,
"an
--
an
obstruction
to
the
performance
of
judicial
duty,
an
obstruction,”
he
said
back
there,
“that
contumacious
refusal
could
be
an
obstruction
resulting
from
an
act
done
in
the
presence
of
the
court
is,
then,
the
characteristic
upon
which
the
power
to
punish
for
contempt
must
rest.
this
being
true,
it
follows
that
the
presence
of
that
element
must
clearly
be
shown
in
every
case
where
the
power
to
punish
for
contempt
is
exerted.
a
principle
which
applied
to
the
--
apply
to
the
subject
in
hand
that
is
perjury
exacts
that
in
order
to
punish
perjury
in
the
presence
of
the
court
as
a
contempt,
there
must
be
added
to
the
essential
elements
of
perjury
under
the
general
law
the
further
element
of
obstruction
to
the
court
in
the
performance
of
its
duty."
do
you
gather
that
he's
saying
there
that
every
--
every
time
without
regard
to
the
materiality
of
anything
or
the
importance
of
anything
that
you
can
always
cite
a
man
for
contempt
summarily
without
showing
that
there's
something
actually
done
to
the
court
of
an
important
nature
and
an
important
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
testimonies
that
may
or
may
not
be
admissible
just
discretionary
with
the
judge?he
leave
it
in
or
take
it
out,
it
won't
hurt
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
would
be
an
obstruction
automatically?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
may
say
in
reference
to
michael
that
i
do
not
agree
that
the
sentence
(inaudible)
as
i
have
read
the
opinion
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
as
a
proof
in
that
case
(inaudible)
if
he's
approving
it
or
disapproving,
it
was
later
signed
because
there
were
different
circumstances
that
is
certainly
does
not
leave
the
impression
on
me
if
i
(inaudible)
it
was
intended
to
approve
it
or
disapprove.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
conceive
of
some
in
case
of
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
be
because
it's
perjurious,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
it
have
to
be
something
else
on
which
to
hang
it.
