justice
john
m.
harlan
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
reach
that
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
get
asked
you
a
question
about
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
assuming
the
premises
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
decides
this
case,
in
other
words,
if
contrary
to
what
you
say
as
to
the
record,
this
lady
had
gotten
up
on
the
stand
and
had
testified
really
the
post-1946
events.
you
would
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
she
has
a
clear
waiver
there
and
that
opened
up
the
--
opened
up
the
cross-examination
which
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
that
made
that
under
that
test
the
only
pertinent
inquiry
as
to
whether
the
cross
was
municipal
cross?
justice
john
m.
harlan
within
the
means
of
the
direct
order
or
whatever
else
you
call
the
rule?
justice
john
m.
harlan
without
notice.
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
--
your
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
makes
it
immaterial
really
in
your
view
as
to
whether
this
is
regarded
as
a
subdivision
(1)
or
a
subdivision
(3)
proceeding
because
if
you
--
is
this
--
is
this
your
position
that
if
you
regard
subdivision
(3)
as
being
--
as
having
force
independently
of
obstruction,
why,
that's
the
end
of
the
matter,
and
if
you
choose
to
regard
obstruction
as
an
element
common
to
all
sections
of
the
statute,
you
got
to
build
in
an
effective
obstruction
by
the
very
definition
of
what's
contained
in
--
in
subdivision
(3),
is
that
--
is
that
it?
