do
we
have
--
do
we
have
to
go
as
far
as
your
answer
to
justice
brennan
would
indicate?
chief
justice
earl
warren
about
the
automobile
accident?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
there
--
isn't
there
a
distinction
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
between
those
two?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
this
case
and
that
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
this
more
like
--
like
the
case
where
the
plaintiff
in
that
personal
injury
suit
would
say,
“i
will
answer
all
questions
up
to
and
including
the
time
of
the
accident.
that
being
within
the
issues
of
this
case,
but
beyond
that,
i
will
not
answer
any
questions
on
the
grounds
that
it
might
tend
to
incriminate
me.”
isn't
that
what
you
have
here
more
--
more
than
a
situation
such
as
mr.
justice
brennan
presents?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
regardless
of
where
it
was
in
point
of
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.

assume,
mr.
spritzer,
that
he
had
cross-examined
her
at
that
particular
time
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
then
the
governor
--
the
government
had
--
had
re-examined
her
on
redirect
examination
and
she
claimed
the
privilege,
would
she
then
still
be
a
compelled
witness
in
your
judgment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
sole
difference
then
is
premised
upon
the
fact
that
he
didn't
cross-examined
her
as
to
this
matter
but
brought
it
out
in
direct
examination
of
her
as
his
own
witness.
chief

mr.
crockett,
you
have
two
more
minutes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
