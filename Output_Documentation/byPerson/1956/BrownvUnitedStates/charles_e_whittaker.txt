justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
think
it's
quite
fair
to
say
that
the
--
that
the
trial
court
held
that
the
mere
taking
of
the
witness
stand
was
the
thing
that
waived
the
privilege
or
that
plus
the
answers
given
to
questions
to
follow?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
implicit
in
that
statement
may
have
it
not
be
said
that
it
means
that
plus
what
she
did
after
taking
the
stand.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
why?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
to
delay
her
what?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
rather
than
to
call
her
as
his
own
witness?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles

whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles

(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
i
don't
understand.
is
that
to
say
that
in
such
a
case,
the
witness
can
get
on
the
stand
and
testify
valiant
really
on
her
own
behalf
so
long
as
she
doesn't
incriminate
herself
and
all
her
question
--
answers
are
self-serving,
she
may
then
not
be
subjected
to
cross-examination
on
the
scope
of
her
directive
testimony?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
on
the
contrary,
she
says,
"i
am
not
guilty.
i
did
not
belong
to
any
organization
that
--
that
advocated
the
overthrow
of
the
government.
i'm
innocent."
that's
the
end
of
it.
she
can't
be
crossed
examined.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
therefore
couldn't
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
and
therefore
her
--
her
testimony
has
to
stand.
we
have
to
take
that.
she
can't
be
cross-examined,
is
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
say
then
we
let
the
court
or
the
jury
hear
the
evidence
then
immediately
tell
them,
"why,
don't
even
mind".
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
what
--
what
particular
provision
of
the
constitution?
i
am
just
trying
to
get
your
point
clear
in
my
mind
and
i
maybe
slow
about
it.
what
particular
provision
in
the
constitution
specifically
authorizes
this.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
compel.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
one
compelled
then
when
he
takes
the
stand
and
covers
the
case
fully
and
voluntarily?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
on
redirect.
