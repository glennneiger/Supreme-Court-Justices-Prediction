justice
felix
frankfurter
hasn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
the
baumgartner.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
spritzer,
my
--
my
difficulty
with
the
case
have
not
been
adverted
to
which
makes
me
suspicious
that
the
colloquy
is
difficult.
namely,
as
i
understood
you
to
say
when
you
opened
the
case
that
this
is
the
--
the
case
that
have
been
before
the
court
fall
into
two
classes
and
this
is
in
neither
class.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
in
fact
a
situation
that's
before
us
for
the
first
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
do
not
draw
the
interference
from
what
you've
said
that
the
claim
that
is
made
is
a
frivolous
one.
i
don't
say
that
it
isn't
--
that
it
isn't
--
to
indicate
that
it
has
weight,
that
you
have
difficulties.
but
it
isn't
an
obvious
coming
of
the
knows
at
the
court
in
taking
this
position
that
this
--
what's
her
name?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mrs.
brown
too.
and
therefore
i
come
to
the
question
of
whether
this
is
really
whether
you
confound
a
charge
of
contempt
on
a
misconception
of
the
scope
of
the
privilege.
and
why
isn't
this
a
situation
within
the
--
within
the
philosophy
--
within
the
direction
of
ex
parte
hudgings
that
it
isn't
enough
to
refuse
to
answer
or
in
that
case,
it
isn't
enough
to
be
committing
perjury,
which
is
worse
than
this
i
should
think
from
the
point
of
its
attitude
and
implications
to
the
judicial
process,
that
unless
it
is
made
clear,
i've
just
looked
at
the
opinion
to
refresh
my
recollection.
unless
the
record
makes
it
appear
very
clearly
that
there
was
a
conscious
purpose
to
obstruct
justice,
you
may
have
all
sorts
of
things
but
you
haven't
got
contempt.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
the
refusal
is
based
unless
the
record
shows
the
contrary
on
a
conscientious
belief
that
she
is
--
that
asserting
her
right
under
the
constitution.
now,
if
the
record
shows
that
obviously
this
is
a
stall,
this
is
a
claim
that
the
witness
--
you
can
say
with
confidence
does
it,
herself
entertain
any
confidence
that
this
is
a
prearrangement
and
all
the
rest
of
it.
i
could
find
it
difficult
to
get
away
from
the
requirement
of
the
ex
parte
hudgings
that
there
must
be
something
more
than
merely
interfering
with
the
testimony
to
which
the
court
is
entitled
with
the
truthful
of
testimony
at
all.
there
must
be
in
the
endeavor
some
active
element
of
obstructing
justice
and
not
merely
a
consequence
in
the
--
in
the
pursuit
of
justice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
touching
the
merits
--
i'm
not
touching
the
merits
of
that
issue
mr.
spritzer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
may
assert
it
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
i'm
--
no
reason
why
i
shouldn't
tell
you.
i
think
i'm
with
you
on
that,
but
i
don't
--
that
doesn't
immediately
add
up
to
contempt.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
spritzer,
the
call
of
a
mockery
of
justice
seems
to
be
a
little
tall
talk
if
i'm
not
mistaken
that
the
english
rule
is
just
about
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
saying
that
to
call
it
a
mockery
of
justice
seems
to
be
a
rather
--
is
a
rather
extravagant
description
of
what
i
believe
to
be
i
think
the
english
rule
on
the
subject
that
a
fellow
can
raise
this
privilege
at
anytime.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
in
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
she
was
both
here,
wasn't
she?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
--
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
with
you
on
the
--
on
the
substantive
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
i
don't
see
why
i
have
to
conceal
what
seems
to
be
a
clear
case
on
that
subject
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
so
far
as
i'm
concern.
well,
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
do
have
great
difficulty
in
saying
“ergo,
it's
contempt.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
were
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
that
and
that
is
what
it
was
in
hudgings.
i
must
say
i
wouldn't
have
--
i
think
the
bar
generally
was
a
little
surprised
when
that
case
came
down
but
the
language
is
there
if
you
would
recall
it.
so
neither
side
would
first
indicate,
for
me
it's
not
--
the
(inaudible)
isn't
part
of
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
may
i
ask
you
whether
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
rested
on
the
proposition
that
merely
by
taking
the
stand
is
a
waiver?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
whether
admission
of
guilty
or
not,
it
was
a
party's
defensive
position,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was
wondering
whether
i
misapprehend
the
emphasis
of
your
argument
that
merely
by
taking
the
stand,
there's
a
waiver
because
as
you
correctly
indicate,
the
court
of
appeals
doesn't
go
on
that
ground.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
will
--
you
will
have
to
face
and
you
have
to
deal
with
the
ground
taken
by
the
court
of
appeals,
namely,
whether
the
petitioner
when
she
was
calling
as
a
witness
by
the
government
was
in
fact
merely
continuing
prior
testimony
on
her
own
behalf.
and
therefore,
for
practical
purposes,
this
is
as
though
the
government
were
cross-examining.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
we
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
we
must
consider
the
record
in
that
--
in
--
in
that
aspect.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
whether
--
that's
a
legal
question.
that's
legal
conclusion
in
order
to
sustain
the
court
of
appeals.
but
before
it
gets
to
the
legal
significance,
am
i
wrong
in
saying
that
the
court
of
appeals
treated
the
question
into
--
sought
to
be
elicited
to
the
answers
which
was
sought
to
be
elicited
by
the
questions
were
put
as
in
effect
cross-examination
on
what
she
had
put
in
on
her
direct.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
that
set
forth
in
the
certificate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
though
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
you
were
suggesting
a
minute
ago
that
the
court
of
appeals
amended
this
certificate
and
i
was
like
to
put
to
you
whether
--
what
you
are
not
really
conveying
by
that
remark
is
that
the
certificate
of
the
district
court
was
inadequate?
it
did
not
comply
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
did
not
comply
with
the
requirements
with
the
specific
require
--
or
the
requirements
for
specific
details
of
the
rules.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
different
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
whether
or
not
there
was
a
waiver,
that
isn't
what
might
be
ordinarily
called
the
question
of
fact,
that's
a
question
of
law
which,
if
it'd
be
a
waiver,
i
should
think
would
be
inherent
in
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
whether
the
inference
could
be
drawn
with
--
whether
that
constituted
a
waiver,
i
should
think
it's
for
a
court
to
decide
however.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
no
jury
here
anyhow
so
or
was
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
crockett,
if
the
witness
--
if
the
witness
admits
guilt,
that
is
practically
pleads
guilty
there,
you
don't
need
anything
else.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
point
of
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
go
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
ask
you
whether
this
quotation
of
yours
was
honestly
is
done
which
you
fantastically
write
it
in
context
which
is
often
has
to
be
whether
that
means
that
every
time
the
court
or
court
punishes
you,
of
course,
to
punish
for
contempt,
the
appellate
court
and
this
court
ultimately
will
have
to
decide
whether
they
couldn't
have
dealt
with
it
some
other
way
without
punishing
for
contempt.
for
instance,
if
a
man
throws
an
anchor
at
a
judge
(inaudible)
dispose
of
it
is
to
have
the
bandit
taken
out
of
the
room.
does
that
mean
he
can't
be
punished
for
contempt?
that
sentence
was
used
with
reference
to
the
power
of
the
legislature
and
not
with
reference
to
the
court
that
in
each
case,
one
asked
to
decide
whether
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
judge
could
have
done
something
else.
i'm
not
saying
that
this
part
was
always
exercised
while
we
are
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
think
that
in
most
of
the
occasion,
it
ought
not
be
disposed
of
in
the
most
sensible
way.
we're
dealing
here
with
power.
and
i
just
wonder
if
you'll
need
to
suggest
that
whenever
a
person,
it
comes
clearly
within
section
1
or
subdivision
(1)
or
(3)
within
401
or
rather
in
order
to
determine
whether
it
does
come
within,
the
court
has
to
decide
whether
it
couldn't
have
been
done
some
other
way
more
expeditiously,
more
effectively
at
least.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can't
believe
that
for
a
minute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
not
the
test
to
be
applied
in
deciding
whether
when
an
unequally
stronger
judge
may
say
--
may
punish
him
for
contempt,
sentence
him
for
three
months
rather
than
have
the
bail
and
take
him
out
and
say
“this
felony
has
to
much
to
drink
the
night
before
or
he
got
a
temper
or
whatnot?”
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
he
--
he
could
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
why?
you
can
terminate
it
by
an
english
baler
for
the
martial
take
them
out
and
go
on
with
the
business.
in
fact,
i
think
that
is
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
you
said
that
we
must
consider
whether
this
was
the
least
thing
that
could
be
done
to
deal
with
the
situation
or
it's
not
the
proposition
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
defendant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
that
should
be
taken
literally,
then
in
each
case,
one
must
decide
whether
although
a
court
has
the
power
of
contempt
which
was
recognized
by
mr.
justice
johnson
to
lead
the
part
from
a
statutory
power
of
the
judiciary
act
but
in
each
case,
you
must
decide
couldn't
he
had
done
something
else.
it
would
have
been
better
and
quicker
and
easier.
justice
felix
frankfurter
nobody
could
agree
with
you
more
than
i
do
that
it
was
desirable
to
limit
the
kind
of
power
that
was
exercised
by
judge
peck
out
in
missouri.
but
collectively
(inaudible)
but
that
doesn't
help
me
to
decide
whether
when
a
situation
comes
within
the
contempt
power
as
limited
by
that
act
which
in
subsequently
what
we
now
have
is
(inaudible)
whether
when
something
comes
within
that
act,
we
can
say
all
the
judge,
if
he'd
been
more
sensible,
would
have
done
it
from
other
way.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
that's
--
i
agree
with
that
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
spritzer,
would
you
mind,
at
the
outset,
stating
to
us
what
you
believe
to
be
arndstein
judgement
side?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
go
off
with
the
generality.
i'd
like
to
ask
some
more
about
arndstein
because
it's
merely
a
(inaudible)
case.
when
you
say
he
was
compelled
witness
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
compulsion
was
that
a
bankrupt
must
file
schedules.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
he
did
was
to
file
schedules
that
the
government
claimed
--
not
the
government
but
the
--
just
being
bankrupt,
was
it?
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
commissioner
--
commissioner
in
bankruptcy.
what
if
his
claim
was
that
he,
in
fact,
lied
in
those
schedules?
he
said
forth,
"i
have
these
and
these
assets,”
which
impliedly
means
he
hadn't
any
the
others.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
he
was
sought
to
be
examined
about
that
schedule.
so
why
isn't
that
--
why
is
that
a
--
why
is
that
--
in
the
first
place,
bankruptcy
was
a
civil
proceeding,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
could
have
been
called,
couldn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
are
you
saying
that
if
she
hasn't
been
called
--
i'm
--
frankly,
i
doubt
that
the
reasons
--
the
--
the
argument
that's
derived
from
arndstein
seems
to
me
funny
almost.
the
conclusion
is
funny.
maybe
the
constitution
compels
some
funny
conclusions.
but
are
you
saying
that
if
she
had
been
called
by
the
government
in
the
first
instance,
as
she
could
have
been
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
mean
if
she
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
she
was
that
--
but
where
--
then
where
does
it
differ
from
arndstein
opinion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
say
is
that
the
matter
had
stopped
there,
if
she
had
had
just
--
if
--
if
her
testimony
as
a
witness
for
the
government
that's
been
the
end
of
the
matter,
had
been
the
end
of
the
matter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
that
if
the
matter
had
stopped
there,
then
it
would
have
been
straight
to
arndstein?
he
hadn't
put
it
on.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
still
troubled
by
arndstein
because
if
one
thing
for
arndstein
to
refuse
the
filed
schedules,
and
then
he
cited
the
failure
to
file
and
then
having
reply,
“i
can't
file
them
because
they
tend
to
incriminate.”
and
what
actually
took
place
in
that
(inaudible)
a
man
filed
and
files
untruthfully
and
he
can't
be
asked
about
the
untruthfulness
of
what
he
thought.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
(voice
overlap)
your
own
troubles
and
you're
not
here
to
defend
it
except
to
the
extent
that
you
differentiate
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
4.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
those
the
only
ones
--
are
those
the
only
ones
that
you
claim
somewhat
in
that
page?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
your
observation
on
the
court's
statement,
"of
course,
this
is
a
contempt
that
occurred
within
the
presence
of
the
court."
justice
felix
frankfurter
"of
course"
particularly,
not
only
this
is
a
--
but
the
“of
course”.
what
is
the
point
of
all
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
couldn't
do
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
those
considerations
are
equally
relevant
whether
it's
(1)
or
(3)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
one
says
--
one
says
in
the
presence
of
the
court
and
--
and
the
other
says
has
a
different
category.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
quite.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
they're
quite
in
view
of
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
spritzer,
let
me
tell
you
my
difficulty,
indeed
great
disability
about
this
case,
not
this
problem
that
you've
been
discussing.
i,
of
course,
agree
that
subsection
(1),
misbehavior
in
the
presence
of
the
court
include
and
may
even
normally
apply
to
conduct
that
could
not
be
brought
under
subsection
--
paragraph
(3).
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
know
it.
i
do
not
think
it,
at
all,
follows
that
because
it
may
be
within
the
description
of
3,
it
is
excluded
from
one.
and
i
vouched
in
--
for
that
purpose
the
citation
in
hudgings.
let
me
read
you
of
judge
howe
said
in
--
in
citing
william
f.
hudgings
for
contempt.
he
set
forth
the
facts
and
he
had
been
duly
sworn,
did
vocally
refuse
to
--
to
answer
certain
questions
truthfully
and
fully
and
likewise
then
and
there,
falsely
square,
whereas
the
said
william
f.
hudgings
in
so
answers,
in
so
answering
and
so
refusing
to
answer
was
guilty
of
a
contempt
of
this
court
and
of
the
authority
of
this
court
by
misbehavior
in
his
presence.
now,
that
recital
therefore,
etcetera,
state
exactly
what
i
put
namely
that
although
it
may
be
within
the
descriptive
category
of
3,
it
is
not
excluded
from
one
as
a
misbehavior
in
the
presence
and
therefore,
the
requirement
of
hudgings
is
something
more
than
the
external
objective
context
is
required
before
you
didn't
find
it
as
a
contempt.
and
for
that,
i
read
what
he
said
--
his
wife
said
as
to
--
"an
obstruction
to
the
performance
of
judicial
duty
resulting
from
an
act
done
in
the
presence
of
the
court."
certainly,
that's
said.
but
it
is
true.
but
the
mistake
if
we
think
evident
since
it's
either
overlooks
or
misconceived,
the
essential
characteristic
of
the
obstructive
tendency
underlying
the
contempt
power
form
the
strictest
attribute
and
necessary
inherent
obstructive
effect
you
call
swearing.
now,
what
i
put
to
you
is
this.
why
should
there
be
such
a
requirement
for
an
establishment
of
misbehavior
of
hudgings
by
answering
and
refusing
to
answer
for
whatever
reason
and
not
be
within
section
1
when
the
refusal
to
answer
was
ex-hypothesized
an
honest
belief
that
the
fifth
amendment
protects.
and
we've
been
discussing
here
and
you've
not
dismissed
this
privilege
the
wave
of
the
problem
so
that
we
have
got
the
case
before
us
in
which
a
court
may
find
that
there
was
at
least
an
honest
legal
question
--
i
don't
mean
an
honest,
not
a
frivolous
legal
question
as
to
whether
she,
in
her
opinion,
could
refuse
which
doesn't
mean
an
order
can't
be
given
but
it
doesn't
follow
that
therefore
she
must
go
to
jail.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
know
but
we
can't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
we
haven't
got
a
statute
in
which
--
which
particularizes
the
sentence
that
is
the
--
that
is
implied
because
i
--
i
go
with
you
and
what
you
said
about
--
generally
about
the
discretionary
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
spritzer,
may
i
say
this
that
i
think
i
always
do
say.
i
told
you
how
difficulty
i
have
that
i
am
unconscious
of
this
problem,
what
--
what
ways
didn't
he
--
this
case.
i
--
never
mind
that.
indeed,
he
was.
but
i
haven't
taken
in
the
full
implication
of
hudgings.
i
didn't
study
the
record.
i
didn't
study
the
record
which
not
be
in
any
other
claim
that
he
was
perjurious.
his
testimony
was
a
perjury
but
also
a
refusal
to
answer.
i
haven't
realized
the
decisions
in
the
lower
courts
preceded
hudgings
where
as
you
well
know,
that
was
rejected.
hudgings
within
the
way
conducted
so
far
as
the
federal
courts
are
concerned,
at
all
federal
courts
at
all
events.
but
i'm
profoundly
troubled
by
--
unless
you
pocket,
unless
you
say
that
only
where
the
obstructions
of
justice
may
be
the
basis
of
a
perjury
indictment,
you
must
go
for
that,
otherwise,
it's
an
order.
and
i
am
not
as
troubled
as
you
are
that
this
would
mean
the
court
couldn't
function
because
i'm
not
suggesting
that
hudgings
says
under
no
circumstances
may
refusal
to
answer
be
of
contempt.
i
don't
think
that's
hudgings.
but
hudgings
says
something,
there
must
be
something
extra
and
here,
is
an
ingredient,
namely,
an
honest
witness,
honestly
has
not
a
fanciful
feeling
that
is
protecting
something
which
if
he's
right,
is
important
to
protect.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
those
instances,
in
other
words,
it
wouldn't
shut
off
the
power
of
a
court
to
go
on
and
attend
to
the
trial
on
the
theory
of
everybody
who
refuses
to
answer
has
a
good
reason
for
refusing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
judge
hand
to
appel,
as
i
remember
it,
he
used
the
phrase
about
making
a
mockery
of
the
court,
what
was
the
phrase?
he
used
some
phrase
of
playing
tricks
with
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
doesn't
he
say
something
like
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
in
hudgings,
the
court
approved
appel,
that
is
it
said
that
illustrative
of
the
principle
of
the
delaying
down
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
so
there
must
be
a
further
element
of
obstruction
in
the
performance
of
the
duty.
isn't
that
true,
they
said
that?
as
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
illustrative
(inaudible)
united
states
v.appel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
--
i
have
that
great
difficulty
in
wondering
what
was
in
suit
that
was
quite
bind
when
he
said
there
must
be
something
additional
perjury.
i
mean,
a
fellow
just
apply
for
--
in
order
to
protect
himself
or
somebody
who
wants
to
protect
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
hudgings.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
had
to
go
further
and
say
that
where
a
perjury
is
involved,
that's
an
exception,
isn't
that
right?
