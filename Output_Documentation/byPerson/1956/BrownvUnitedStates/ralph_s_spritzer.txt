mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
of
appeals
made
clear
and
i'm
just
referring
at
the
moment
to
record
46,
made
clear
in
its
opinion
that
it
was
not
holding
that
the
mere
fact
of
taking
the
witness
stand
by
the
civil
defendant
who
volunteered
in
this
case
was
a
waiver.
thus
it
stated
here,
she
testified
at
length
in
her
own
defense
and
our
conclusions
are
based
upon
that
fact.
i
think
we
have
in
this
case
a
situation,
which
is
unlike
that
which
has
ever
come
before
this
court
before
in
connection
with
the
matter
of
waiver
of
privilege.
i
think
there
have
been
two
classic
types
of
cases,
which
should
come
to
the
court.
the
first
and
most
numerous
class
involves
the
witness
who
is
required
as
by
force
of
subpoena
to
come
in
and
to
testify.
the
witness
may
be
one
who
appeared
before
a
congressional
committee.
he
may
be
one
who
is
summoned
before
a
grand
jury.
he
may
have
been
summoned
before
a
commissioner
in
bankruptcy
as
in
arndstein
against
mccarthy.
he
may
have
been
a
witness
compelled
to
testify
before
an
administrative
tribunal
or
a
court.
now
in
all
of
those
situations,
the
rule
would
seem
clearly
to
be
that
the
witness
does
not
waive
privilege,
cannot
indeed
waive
privilege
at
least
until
the
point
is
reached
where
he
is
asked
a
question,
which
he
had
an
option
of
answer.
the
compelled
witness
by
definition
has
to
answer
every
question,
which
is
not
privileged.
i'm
assuming
that
the
questions
are
within
the
competence
of
the
inquisitorial
body
to
ask.consequently
there
could
be
no
basis
for
an
inference
of
waiver
until
the
point
was
reached
that
the
witness
chose
to
answer
questions,
which
he
might
have
refused.
now
of
course
when
they
get
difficult
questions
as
to
when
that
point
is
reached
when
you
can
say
that
the
witness
made
a
clear
choice.
but
my
point
here
is
that
this
case
does
not
fall
into
that
category
at
all
because
if
we
are
correct
in
our
reading
of
the
facts
and
they
were
so
interpreted
by
the
courts
below,
this
is
not
a
case
of
a
witness
who
in
any
sense
was
under
compulsion.
this
is
a
case
of
a
witness
who
elected,
who
volunteered
to
persuade
the
trier
of
the
fact
on
a
particular
issue
in
the
case.
as
i
said,
there's
a
second
class
of
cases
which
has
come
before
this
court
and
that
class
of
course
represented
by
cases
like
raffel
and
caminetti,
involved
the
criminally
accused.
the
rule
there
has
generally
been
stated
that
the
criminally
accused
if
he
elects
to
take
the
stand
waives
as
to
any
and
every
fact
that's
an
issue
in
the
case.
the
theory
of
that
i
think
is
that
the
criminally
accused
knows
that
as
soon
as
he
gets
on
the
stand
of
necessity,
he
is
going
to
have
to
talk
about
incriminating
matters
because
nothing
else
is
relevant
in
his
case.
consequently,
there's
a
basis
for
applying
a
broad
rule
of
waiver
and
holding
him
to
the
necessity
of
talking
about
all
of
the
interconnected
facts,
which
go
to
the
ultimate
question
of
guilt
or
innocence.
now,
we
are
not
urging
here
and
i
do
not
think
the
court
of
appeals
held
here
that
the
rule,
which
has
been
ordinarily
applied
to
the
criminally
accused
must
be
automatically
applied
to
the
civil
defendant
who
elects
to
take
the
stand.
i
think
there
may
well
be
a
difference,
one
can
certainly
conceive
of
cases
in
which
a
civil
defendant
might
be
taken
completely
by
surprise
by
questions
posed
on
cross-examination.
and
it's
certainly
unnecessary
in
this
case
to
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
civil
defendant
merely
by
taking
the
stand
waives
as
to
everything
in
the
case.
i
think
what
the
court
of
appeals
in
substance
held
here
was,
that
a
party
to
a
civil
case
could
not
voluntarily
take
the
stand,
offer
herself
as
a
witness
in
her
own
course,
undertake
to
persuade
the
trier
of
the
facts
of
her
side
of
the
story
and
then
claim
privilege
as
to
the
very
matters,
the
very
subject
matter,
which
she
opened
up
on
her
own
direct
examination.
now,
that
brings
me
to
the
question,
what
did
she
open
up
under
direct
examination
in
this
case?
what
was
the
sequence
of
events
which
transpired
before
the
district
court
held
that
mrs.
brown
was
in
contempt.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
think
it
would
have
to
be
municipal
cross-examination
or
certainly,
there
would
be
no
contempt.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
think
one
need
go
no
further
in
this
case
than
to
say
that
a
witness
who
offers
herself
on
direct
must
answer
cross-examination
which
is
germane
to
the
issues
on
which
she
speaks
and
one
could
limit
it
further
and
say
for
purposes
of
this
case
directly
related
to
her
testimony
in
chief.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i
was
saying
that
even
if
the
rule
were
so
narrow
that
the
party
opened
it
up
only
as
to
the
matter
--
to
the
subject
matter
which
was
covered
by
the
testimony
in
chief.
i
think
that
subject
matter
was
opened
up
here.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
i
--
i
was
suggesting
even
if
the
rule
were
narrower
there'd
be
no
problem
in
this
case.
and
this
is
what
i
have
in
mind,
let
us
suppose
for
a
moment
that
mrs.
brown
testified
as
she
did
when
she
was
the
government
witness
and
she
testified
as
follows.
she
answered
all
questions
which
related
to
pre-1946
and
then
as
to
questions
which
were
either
unlimited
as
to
time
or
post-1946
she
claimed
privilege.
now,
if
her
counsel
had
later
pushed
her
on
the
stand
as
a
witness
in
her
own
behalf
and
confined
himself
similarly
to
the
same
pre-1946
period,
i
don't
think
mrs.
brown
ever
would
have
been
held
in
contempt
in
this
case.
i
don't
think
in
other
words
that
the
mere
fact
that
he
elected
to
put
her
on
the
stand
as
his
own
witness,
instead
of
cross-examining
her
when
she
was
the
government's
witness
would
necessarily
have
been
conclusive
if
she
had
limited
herself,
limited
her
to
the
pre-1946
matter.
but
essentially,
what
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
saying
is
that
she
is
entitled
to
have
it
both
ways.
she
claimed
privilege
when
she
was
the
government's
witness
instead
i
won't
talk
about
what
happened
after
1946.
the
questions
put
to
her
were
quite
specific.
had
she
been
a
party
member
anytime
from
the
date
of
naturalization
to
january
1,
1950?
was
it
true
that
she'd
been
a
member
of
such
and
such
a
communist
party
club
in
1948?
had
she
held
party
meetings
at
her
home
in
1948?
had
she
been
a
member
of
the
executive
board
of
its
communist
club
in
1948?
now
as
to
all
of
these
questions
when
she
was
the
government's
witness,
she
refused
to
answer
asserting
her
privilege.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
she
was
called
initially
by
the
government
as
the
adverse
party
and
i
think
she
had
a
dual
capacity.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
she's
the
party
witness.
and
if
i
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
indeed.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
think
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
the
state
court
case
has
indicated
that.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i'm
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
there
are
very
few
federal
cases
on
this
one.
but
what
i
was
--
the
point
i
was
attempting
to
make,
if
your
honor
please,
and
i
think
this
is
--
is
actually
important
because
waiver
is
a
question
of
fact.
her
privilege
was
sustained
so
long
as
she
was
a
compelled
witness
called
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
as
an
adverse
party.
during
that
testimony
as
a
government
witness,
she
refused
and
the
court
sustained
privilege
without
any
reservation
or
hesitation.
she
refused
to
testify
as
to
any
post-1946
act
or
affiliation.
now
there
is
no
contention
to
those
questions
as
to
post-1946
weren't
relevant.
petitioner
concedes
that
they
were
and
that
it's
relevant
to
show
it's
probative
if
one
can
show
it
to
prove
that
one
was
a
communist
party
member
in
1946,
to
show
that
she
was
a
member
in
1947,
1948,
1949
and
1950.
so
far
then,
her
privilege
is
fully
sustained.
at
the
end
of
the
government's
case,
defense
counsel
announces
i
am
now
putting
petitioner
on
the
stand
as
a
witness
for
the
defendant.
and
i'd
say
at
that
point,
defense
counsel
proceeded
to
ask
her
questions
which
were
unlimited
as
to
time
which
related
specifically
to
period
after
1946.
questions
which
can
only
be
read
as
showing
a
calculated
effort
to
convince
the
court,
the
trier
of
the
fact,
that
mrs.
brown
at
all
times,
both
before
and
after
naturalization
had
been
attached
to
the
principles
of
the
constitution
and
that
she
had
never
at
anytime
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
now
those
questions
are
set
forth
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
at
page
43,
their
quote
from
the
record.
and
there
is
a
whole
series
of
questions
there
occupying
most
of
that
page
in
which
defense
counsel
repeatedly
asks
what
does
the
witness
believed
today,
have
you
ever,
are
you
ever,
or
were
you
ever.
in
other
words,
there
are
questions
which
clearly
cover
the
entire
span,
both
her
acts
before
and
after
naturalization.
i
won't
read
everyone
of
them
but
your
honors
will
see
that
they
are
all
unlimited
as
to
time
and
that
the
only
purpose
of
this
testimny
could
have
been
convinced
the
court
that
at
no
time
had
mrs.
brown
been
associated
with
the
organizations
which
she
was
alleged
to
have
been
associated
with
when
she
filed
her
naturalization
application.
one
of
the
questions,
“to
your
knowledge,
did
you
ever
belong
to
any
organization
that
taught
or
advocated
anarchy
or
the
overthrow
of
the
existing
government?”
now,
we
say
under
any
rule,
a
party
witness
who
opens
up
a
particular
subject
in
issuing
the
case
and
tries
to
persuade
the
court,
the
trier
of
the
facts
as
to
his
version
must
necessarily
be
taken
to
have
assumed
the
concomitant
burden
of
asking
--
of
answering
questions
posed
on
cross-examination.
and
it
did
essentially
that
that
we
view
the
court
of
appeals
as
having
held
matters
of
rule
which
we
take
it
to
have
applied
in
this
case.
now
actually
getting
back
to
a
question
which
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
a
short
time
ago
about
what
the
cases
hold.
there
had
been
few
federal
cases
in
the
appellate
courts
where
the
question
of
waiver
of
privilege
by
a
party
volunteer
in
a
civil
case
has
arisen.
one
can
perhaps
surmise
that
most
civil
defendants
expect
to
be
cross-examined
or
if
they
balk
and
they
are
told
that
they
have
to
submit
to
cross-examination
because
they
volunteered
and
they
opened
themselves
up
that
they
then
comply.
there
are
two
district
court
cases
which
we
have
cited.
we've
also
cited
three
state
court
cases
and
i
--
i
might
allude
briefly
to
one
or
two
of
those
cases.
in
united
states
against
brooks,
which
was
a
district
court
case
in
michigan,
we
have
a
situation
not
too
dissimilar
from
the
one
here
and
that
that
was
a
deportation
case.
and
one
of
the
contentions
there
was
that
an
admission
of
a
conviction
of
bigamy
was
made
by
the
deportee
over
objections
which
were
erroneously
overruled
by
the
naturalization
examiner.
and
the
district
court
stated
in
discussing
that
point,
it
appears
from
the
record
that
petitioner
consented
to
be
sworn
and
to
testify
in
his
own
behalf.
he
does
waive
any
constitutional
right
to
refuse
to
answer
even
criminating
questions
so
long
as
they
were
germane
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
inquiry.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
case
says
any
--
anything
germane
to
the
issue.
it
may
be
--
as
i've
suggested
i
don't
think
you
need
go
that
far
to
have
the
waiver
here.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
it
does,
yes.
now,
the
question
has
arisen
in
the
state
courts
in
--
in
various
forms.
one
of
the
forms
in
which
it
has
arisen
almost
exactly
corresponds
to
the
question,
the
hypothetical,
which
your
honor
gave
to
petitioner's
counsel
earlier.
there's
a
recent
delaware
case
decided
in
1954
which
we
have
not
cited
in
our
brief
but
which
i
would
like
to
cite
to
the
court
now.
it's
at
--
it's
at
48
delaware,
395,
carey
against
bryan
and
others.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
carey,
c-a-r-e-y,
your
honor.
that
was
a
case
in
which
a
truck
driver
got
involved
in
an
accident.
he
testified
about
the
accident
in
seeking
compensation.
he
was
asked
on
cross-examination
if
he
hadn't
been
drinking
on
the
evening
of
the
accident.
he
refused
to
answer
the
question.
it
wasn't
clear
whether
he
refused
on
the
grounds
of
privilege
against
self-incrimination
or
on
the
ground
that
he
thought
it
would
degrade
him.
the
court,
the
delaware's
highest
court
in
discussing
it
assumed
arguendo
that
he
had
based
his
refusal
in
part
at
least
upon
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
and
the
court
there
stated
and
i
quote
from
its
opinion,
“having
testified
to
a
part
of
the
transaction
in
which
he
was
concerned
he
is
bound
to
state
the
whole.”
and
they
held
that
he
would
have
to
lose
his
claim
for
recovery
unless
on
remand
of
the
matter
he
answered
questions
on
cross-examination.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
they
said
he
had
no
case
if
he
didn't
answer
these
questions.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
assume
that
her
testimony
was
in
effect
struck.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
--
i
would
assume
that
her
testimony
could
hardly
be
considered
as
having
any
testimonial
credibility
when
she
refuses
to
submit
to
cross-examination.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
think
there
are
two
separate
questions,
your
honor.
i
think
the
first
one
is
an
evidentiary
question
whether
the
court
could
give
any
weight
to
testimony
which
was
not
subject
to
the
guarantees
which
flow
from
cross-examination.
i
think
the
second
question
is
quite
distinct
one.
the
court
i
think
might
have
stopped.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
only
the
contempt
question
is
before
your
honor.
there
is
no
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
denaturalization
in
this
case.
i
think
the
contempt
matter
is
distinct
from
the
evidentiary
one.
i
think
if
there
was
no
privilege
then
the
court
had
it
within
its
power
to
compel
or
direct
an
answer.
i
think
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
pardon?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
six
months
in
jail.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
is
a
severe
sentence,
yes,
your
honor.
i
--
i
was
--
the
point
i
was
about
to
make
your
honor
is
that
i
think
the
--
the
court
has
an
interest
as
does
the
other
party
in
getting
all
of
the
evidence
which
is
not
privileged
that
any
witness
before
the
court
has
to
offer.
now
the
court
in
this
case,
while
its
ultimate
sentence
was
severe,
it
was
in
no
sense
immoderate.
the
court
fully
recognized
the
privilege
when
it
had
been
asserted
when
mrs.
brown
was
called
as
the
government
witness.
when
she
took
the
stand
and
she
opened
these
matters
up
on
direct
and
then
refused
cross-examination,
the
court
heard
argument
on
the
matter,
it
reserved
its
ruling
until
the
next
day.
it
advised
mrs.
brown
that
she
had
certainly
waived
her
privilege
by
her
direct
testimony
and
asked
her
to
answer
and
the
witness
persistently
refused.
now
i
think
at
this
point,
it
becomes
a
decision
very
largely
for
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge
as
to
what
measures
he
thinks
are
necessary
to
vindicate
the
authority
of
the
court.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
indeed.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
indeed.
our
whole
argument
is
based
on
the
fact
that
the
cases
of
--
well,
the
compelled
witness
waived
nothing
by
taking
the
stand
and
testifying
certainly
because
he
has
to
testify
at
least
until
he
is
queried
about
the
matters
to
which
he
might
claim
privilege.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
right.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
is
itself
a
waiver
at
least
as
to
those
issues
on
which
--
to
which
the
party
addresses
itself
on
direct
examination.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
make
that
limitation
for
this
reason.
i
think
this
would
be
a
harder
case,
a
considerably
harder
case
for
the
government
and
i
also
have
the
gravest
doubts
whether
the
witness
ever
would
have
been
held
in
contempt
if
she
had
consistently
sought
to
limit
herself
to
the
pre-1946
period.
in
other
words,
i
don't
think
that
one
need
make
the
basis
of
waiver
the
fact
of
taking
the
stand.
i
think
one
can
look
as
well
to
what
the
witness
tried
to
persuade
the
court
about
after
she
took
the
stand.
now,
if
for
some
undisclosed
reason,
her
counsel
had
chosen
to
have
mrs.
brown
elaborate
on
pre-1946
matters
as
a
witness
called
for
herself
rather
than
they
have
her
do
it
on
cross-examination
as
the
government
witness,
i
don't
know
if
that
would
be
a
crucial
waiver.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
and
to
put
it
in
other
words,
i'm
trying
to
convey
therefore
and
i
think
it's
a
very
easy
case.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
i
am
--
i
think,
your
honor,
misunderstood.
i
was
referring
to
this
delaware
case
which
i
had.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
in
this
case
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
if
she
had
taken
the
stand.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
the
government
had
to
prove
its
case
independently
by
clear
convincing
a
non-equivocal
proof
which
it
--
was
held
to
have
done
in
this
case
by
several
independent
witnesses.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
her
--
i'm
--
i'm
not
--
i'm
afraid
i
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
sir?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
was
thinking
of
an
answer
to
a
question
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
rather
than
the
answer
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
in
terms
of
the
pleading.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
she
was
under
no
obligation
to
file
an
answer.
i
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
government
would
have
to
prove
its
complaint
by
a
clear
convincing
evidence
under
the
schneiderman
rules.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
baumgartner
and
the
schneiderman,
the
clear
convincing
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
the
cases
hold
that
the
government
must
prove
by
clear
convincing
and
unequivocal
proof
in
a
denaturalization
case
the
allegations
of
its
complaint.
now
here,
the
government
had
several
witnesses,
their
testimony
is
not
before
your
honors
because
this
comes
up
only
on
the
contempt
question.
there's
no
appeal
from
the
denaturalization
judgment.
we
have
printed
the
full
opinion
of
the
district
court
which
dealt
with
the
issue
of
denaturalization
as
well
as
with
the
issue
of
contempt
and
that
opinion
shows
that
the
court
grew
inference
from
mrs.
brown's
assertion
of
privilege.
it
didn't
find
the
substitute
of
proof
in
any
of
her
conduct
at
the
trial,
but
relied
exclusively
upon
independent
evidence
of
government
witnesses
which
it
explicitly
found
to
meet
the
schneiderman
and
baumgartner
case.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
she
had
a
right
--
she
could
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
had
a
right
to
claim
privilege
and
when
she
claimed
it,
it
was
sustained.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
right.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
so
far
as
i
know.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mrs.
brown.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
there
is
here
of
course
a
direct
refusal
following
an
order
--
order
--
repeated
orders
of
the
court
to
answer
the
question.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
the
--
the
courts
below
believed
that
there
could
be
no
serious
doubts
that
a
witness
advised
by
counsel
would
appreciate
that
giving
direct
testimony
exposes
one
to
answering
questions
on
story
one
tells
and
that
if
one
doesn't
have
a
privilege
to
--
to
hit
and
run
as
it
were
to
tell
a
self-serving
exculpatory
story
and
then
say,
“i'm
not
going
to
testify
any
further.”
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
well
that
brings
us
the
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
was
stating
that
as
--
as
background
for
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
further,
which
i
--
i
think
is
probably
what
lies
at
the
root
of
the
district
court's
thinking
also.
and
the
court
said,
“to
hold
that
a
defendant
under
the
claim
of
protection
against
self-incrimination
may
tell
his
full
self-serving
story
without
any
test
of
its
truth
by
cross-examination
is
to
make
a
mockery
of
the
judicial
proceeding.”
now
i
think
the
district
court
doubtlessly
tells
in
this
case
before
the
defendant
after
successfully
claiming
privilege
as
to
all
post-1946
matters
to
reintroduce
that
on
her
direct
testimony
and
get
whatever
benefit
might
come
from
these
self-serving
statements
and
then
to
assert
immediately
again
when
the
government
counsel
took
the
stand,
privilege
was
a
mockery
of
the
court's
proceeding.
it's
a
rather
strange
notion
i
think
that
a
volunteer
witness
can
talk
about
a
particular
subject
when
the
questions
are
asked
by
his
own
counsel,
but
can
refrain
from
talking
about
it
when
the
questions
are
asked
by
opposing
counsel.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
catch
the
beginning
of
that.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
your
honor,
the
english
rule
i
think
and
i
presume,
your
honor
refers
to
regina
versus
garbett,
which
says
privilege
can
be
claimed
at
any
time,
refers
to
the
case
of
the
witness
who
was
a
compelled
or
compellable
witness
not
a
party
to
the
case.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
intimation
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
right.
she
was
a
party
to
the
--
she
however
was
a
volunteer
party
when
the
contempt
occurred.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
when
she
was
just
a
called
witness,
her
privilege
was
sustained.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
as
to
that,
i
don't
think
i
can
add
to
what
their
record
shows
as
to
what
transpired.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
don't
want
to
convey
that
i
think
the
witness
show
disrespect
or
impertinence
or
anything
of
that
kind.
i
--
i
don't
think
there
is
a
suggestion
of
that.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
when
this
case
was
here
last
term,
petitioner,
as
the
court
will
recall,
devoted
herself
entirely
to
the
argument
that
there
had
been
no
waiver
of
privilege.
we
denied
that
as
we
do
now
for
we
say
basically
that
the
notion
that
a
party
can
volunteer
direct
testimony
in
her
own
cause
consisting
here
of
a
series
of
general
denials
of
broad
exculpatory
statements,
the
word
“general
denials”
is
the
term
of
petitioner's
counsel
in
its
brief
on
re-argument.
the
notion
that
a
party
can
volunteer
such
general
denials
on
direct
testimony
and
then
its
her
privilege,
when
cross-examined
for
purposes
of
testing
the
veracity
of
those
exculpatory
statements,
is
simply
one
that
we
think
is
wholly
unacceptable
and
has
no
foundation
at
all.
if
i
understand
correctly,
the
argument
of
petitioner's
counsel
here
today,
namely,
that
a
defendant
in
a
case
and
takes
the
stand
and
then
ward
off
cross-examination,
so
long
as
a
defendant
in
his
direct
examination
does
not
incriminate
himself,
then
i
suppose
that
the
logic
of
that
would
apply
equally
to
the
criminal
case.
it
would
follow,
i
suppose,
if
that
were
a
sound
argument
that
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
can
take
the
stand
and
protest
innocence
and
then
meet
every
question
on
cross-examination
with
the
statement
that
the
answer
might
incriminate
him.
i
think
i
hardly
need
to
cite
the
cases
to
demonstrate
that
that
is
not
the
law.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
since
it
was
a
civil
case,
i
think
she
was
subject
to
being
called
as
a
party
witness
under
the
civil
rules.
she
was
so
called
--
she
claimed
privilege
when
she
was
called
as
a
compelled
witness.
and
in
every
instance
that
the
claim
was
made,
it
was
sustained
by
the
district
judge.
she
got
into
this
difficulty,
the
citation
for
contempt
came
about
only
as
the
result
of
the
fact
that
she
reappeared
on
the
stand
a
second
time
volunteering
as
a
witness
in
her
own
behalf.
on
that
second
appearance
as
a
witness
in
her
own
behalf,
she
testified
without
limitation
as
of
the
time.
she
said
that
both
prior
to
the
date
of
naturalization
and
after
the
date
of
denaturalization
at
the
present
times,
she
had,
she
had
never
done
nor
never
believed
in
various
matters.
then
when
she
was
cross-examined,
she
reasserted
the
privilege.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
--
i
certainly
was
coming
to
that.
i
think
petitioner
is
simply
confusing
the
case
of
a
compelled
witness
with
the
case
of
a
volunteer
witness.
arndstein
was
called
before
a
commissioner
in
bankruptcy.
he
was
a
bankrupt.
and
there
was
a
petition
of
fraud.
and
he
was
called
before
the
commissioner
as
a
compelled
witness.
the
commissioner
asked
for
a
certain
date
or
an
information
and
arndstein
produced
a
limited
amount.
actually,
i
think
it
was
a
statement
of
some
--
a
statement
of
assets
and
liability.
he
was
then
asked
to
give
further
information
and
to
produce
more
and
claim
privilege.
but
this
court,
ultimately,
held
that
the
partial
disclosures
made
by
giving
this
limited
amount
of
information
did
not
constitute
a
waiver
of
privilege
on
the
part
of
a
compelled
witness.
it
said
that
a
compelled
witness,
an
involuntary
witness
does
not
waive
privilege,
of
course,
until
the
point
is
reached
where
he
makes
a
disclosure
which
gives
proof
of
crime
or
implication
in
a
crime.
of
course,
in
the
case
of
a
compelled
witness,
he
can't
claim
privilege
until
something
incriminating
is
asked
to
him.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
was
the
commissioner
in
banking
(inaudible)
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
was.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
i
--
i
concede
that
in
a
civil
proceeding,
one
who
is
testifying
under
compulsion
certainly
doesn't
weigh
a
privilege
by
answering
some
questions.
he
can
be
taken
away
of
privilege
only
if
he
testifies
fully
as
to
--
as
to
his
transaction.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
she
was.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
and
did.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
her
--
her
claim
of
privilege
was
honored
when
she
was
being
called
as
the
government's
witness.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
--
i
think
that
is
the
--
the
whole
point,
your
honor.
under
the
civil
--
under
the
rules
of
civil
procedure,
she
could
be
called
in
a
civil
case
as
an
adverse
party
to
the
stand
and
she
was
called.
now,
that
point,
government
counsel
begins
to
question
her.
i
say
she
has
to
answer
until
the
point
is
reached
when
she
is
asked
a
question
which
is
incriminatory.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
certainly.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
her
--
her
claim
of
privilege
was
sustained
every
time
it
was
asserted
when
she
a
witness
for
the
government.
she
was
not
content
to
let
matters
rest
there.
her
counsel
said
he
was
not
going
to
cross-examine
her.
there
is
no
suggestion
that
he
was
going
to
cross-examine
her
later.
page
19,
he
says,
"i
won't
cross-examine
--
cross-examine
the
witness
at
this
point.
i
will
put
her
on,
on
direct."
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
don't
even
think
the
arndstein
problem
arose
on
her
direct
examination
by
the
government
because
i
don't
think
she
made
any
partial
disclosures
at
all
which
any
disclosure
which
could
said
--
be
said
to
be
incriminatory
on
--
on
direct
examination
by
the
government.
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
case
than
a
question
of
refusal,
any
question
of
waiver
or
privilege,
any
question
of
contempt
if
she
had
been
content
to
rest
--
to
let
matters
rest
as
they
stood
after
she
had
been
called
as
a
compelled
or
involuntary
witness.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
he
could
have
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
it
rest
upon
any
technical
kind
of
difference.
i
assume
that
if
she
had
been
cross-examined
by
her
own
counsel
and
cross-examination
had
been
within
the
scope
of
the
direct,
then
there
would
have
been
no
greater
freedom
on
the
part
of
the
government
on
redirect
than
there
had
been
on
direct.
what
i'm
saying
is
when
the
witness
took
the
stand
in
her
own
behalf
and
testified
about
the
whole
case,
about
matters
which
she
had
refused
to
talk
about
when
she
was
a
government
witness
that
then,
she
could
no
longer
resume
the
field
of
the
privilege
and
say,
"i'm
going
to
talk
about
subject
x
and
y
when
my
own
counsel
asks
me
the
questions
but
not
when
government
counsel
does."
i
say
that
she
could
not
volunteer
the
witness
and
make
a
broad
statement,
"i
have
never
been
a
member
of
any
organization
which
taught
or
advocated
the
overthrow
of
the
government,”
and
then
refuse
on
cross-examination
to
answer
the
question,
“have
you
ever
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party?"
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
think
that
there
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
think
there,
there
was
the
element
that
the
further
inquiries
made
of
arndstein
would
have
compelled
additional
disclosures
and
it
was
not
at
all
clear
that
the
initial
disclosures
constituted
admission
of
facts
which
themselves
would
make
out
of
pride.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
if
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
if
mrs.
brown
were
first
called
as
the
government
witness
and
then
she
had
been
cross-examined,
i
think
if,
on
cross-examination,
her
counsel
had
gone
outside
the
scope
of
the
direct
and
asked
her
to
testify
as
to
new
matter,
then
i
think
that
the
government
could
cross-examine
as
to
such
new
matter
and
if
there
would
have
been
a
waiver
as
to
those
transactions.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
on
redirect.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i'm
saying
if
her
own
counsel
took
her
outside
the
scope
of
direct
and
introduced
new
matter
on
cross,
then,
i
think,
the
matter
would
be
in
the
same
posture
as
if
she
had
been
called
as
her
own
witness
and
that
manner
had
been
brought
out.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
if
the
cross-examination
were
complying
to
the
scope
of
the
direct
that
the
government's
position
to
elicit
information
would
many
way
be
enlarged.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
certainly.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
now,
your
--
let
me
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
on
direct
examination,
you
honor,
the
government
asked
her
about
her
affiliations
and
activities
since
the
basis
of
this
denaturalization
sue
was
a
claim
of
fraud
and
procuring
naturalization,
fraud
in
that
she
was
alleged
to
have
denied
in
her
application
for
naturalization,
she
was
alleged
to
have
made
false
denial
with
her
membership
in
the
communist
party.
the
government
asked
her
on
direct
examination
whether
before
1946,
which
was
the
date
of
her
naturalization,
she
had,
in
fact,
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
she
said,
"no,
i
have
not
been."
the
government
then
went
on
and
counsel
asked
her
questions
designed
to
show
if
affirmative
answers
were
given,
they
would
have
been
designed
to
show
that
there
was
an
inconsistency
because
certainly,
she'd
been
a
regular
member
or
such
with
the
implication
of
the
questions
in
subsequent
areas
at
the
time.
she
said,
"i
will
not
answer
any
questions
which
relate
to
the
period
after
1946.
i
claim
my
privilege."
the
court
ruled
that
that
was
a
proper
claim
of
the
privilege.
the
net
result
was
that
on
direct
examination
by
the
government,
mrs.
brown
testified
that
before
1946,
her
conduct
had
been
entirely
consistent
with
her
naturalization
application.
she
also
testified
--
on
examination
by
the
government,
she
also
stated
on
examination
by
the
government
that
she
would
not
say
anything
about
matters
post-1946.
that's
the
posture
of
it
when
she
is
put
on
the
stand
as
a
witness
in
her
own
behalf.
her
own
counsel
then
asks
her
a
series
of
questions,
"did
you
ever
believed
in
it?
do
you
now?
were
you
ever
a
member
of
that?
are
you
now?"
not
limited
to
the
period
before
1946.
those
questions
are
--
series
of
them
is
set
out
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
on
pages
43
in
the
record.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
he
asked
questions
which
covered
the
same
subject
matter.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
their
questions
are
on
43,
your
honor,
of
the
record.
one
of
them
is,
"to
your
knowledge,
did
you
ever
belong
to
any
organization
that
taught
or
advocated
anarchy
or
the
overthrow
of
the
existing
government
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
in
this
country?"
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
she
had
declined
to
answer
as
to
her
membership,
belief,
activities
after
1946.
she
then
got
up
and
covered
the
post-1946
event
in
her
direct
making
as
to
--
in
answer
to
all
questions,
general
exculpatory
statements.
then
when
the
cross-examination
comes,
she
resumes
the
position
originally
taken
that
she's
not
going
to
answer
any
questions
put
by
government
counsel
which
relate
to
the
post-1946
period.
now,
there
can
be,
i
submit,
no
such
privilege.
the
privilege
is
a
privilege
to
remain
silent.
it
is
not,
we
submit,
a
privilege
to
tell
a
one-sided
version
of
particular
events.
now,
i
would
like
to
take
just
a
moment
while
still
on
the
subject
of
waiver
and
privilege
and
before
going
on
to
the
question
of
contempt
and
contempt
sanctions
to
say
that
we
do
not
read
the
district
court's
opinion
as
stating
merely
that
there
was
a
waiver
by
taking
stand.
that
opinion
appears
in
the
record
at
pages
38
to
40.
and
the
court
begins
its
opinion
on
the
contempt
matter,
and
i'm
looking
at
the
first
paragraph
of
the
opinion
on
page
38.
it
begins
by
saying
that
she
waived
the
right
to
claim
any
privileges
under
the
fifth
amendment
by
reason
of
having
testified
as
a
witness
in
her
own
behalf.
i
go
on
to
page
39
in
the
bottom
of
that
page
and
the
court
points
out,
"the
defendant
was
then
examined
by
her
own
counsel
at
length
with
respect
to
the
subject
of
this
suit.
and
at
the
end
of
such
direct
examination,
the
district
attorney
asked
certain
relevant
and
material
questions
with
respect
to
these
proceedings."
so
i
say
that
there
is
emphasis
at
various
points
in
the
opinion
on
the
fact
that
she
testified
fully
and
not
merely
on
the
fact
that
she
took
the
stand.
it's
perfectly
true
that
on
page
40,
the
court
goes
on
and
says,
"the
court
is
of
the
opinion
that
the
defendant,
in
taking
the
stand
as
a
witness
in
her
own
behalf,
waived
the
right,”
etcetera.
now,
reading
the
several
expressions
together,
i
wouldn't
say
that
this
opinion
constitutes
a
holding
that
merely
taking
the
oath
is
a
waiver.
i
think
that
we
need
rest
on
no
more
than
the
proposition
that
the
court
of
appeals
rested
on
which
is
that
certainly,
a
witness
can't
testify
voluntarily
as
a
witness
in
her
own
behalf
as
to
particular
matters
and
then
shut
off
cross-examination
as
to
those
things.
now,
these
are
points
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
questions
are
referred
to
your
honor
on
page
43
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
and
4
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
--
i
don't
think
they're
the
only
one.
but
i
certainly
think
they're
--
they're
the
more
important
ones.
they're
the
ones
the
court
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
quoted
in
its
opinion.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i'm
--
i'm
--
the
government,
we
would
stand
on
that.
yes,
i'm
not
saying
there's
anymore
extreme
or
serious
in
other
questions.
i'm
merely
saying
that
i
don't
know
the
complete
list.
the
court
of
appeals
singled
out
some
of
the
questions
she
answered
on
her
own
counsels
for
that
examination
and
then
referred
some
of
the
questions
that
she
refused
to
answer
on
cross.
and
i
don't
--
i
think
there
are
some
other
cites.
i
don't
think
there
--
they
add
anything.
turning
from
the
questions
then
which
go
to
the
nature
of
a
privilege
and
what
constitutes
a
waive
or
privilege
to
the
questions
which
go
to
the
issue
was
the
contempt
power
properly
invoked
and
is
the
sentence
for
contempt
and
authorized
sentence.
now,
of
course,
we
are
relying
here,
as
the
court
has
heard,
on
the
proposition
that
this
was
a
contempt
under
the
third
subparagraph
of
section
401.
the
court
--
the
district
court
that
is
made
a
point
at
each
occasion
when
mrs.
brown
refused
to
answer
the
questions
on
cross-examination
of
directing
her
to
do
so.
and
his
ultimate
holding
as
to
contempt
rested
upon
her
refusal
to
obey
that
direction.
i
might
say
in
passing
that
the
district
judge
heard
legal
argument
as
to
the
claim
that
there
had
been
no
waiver
of
privilege.
he
adjourned
to
the
court
after
hearing
that
legal
argument
overnight.
he
came
back
the
next
day,
and
he
ruled
against
the
petitioner's
claim
that
she
would
still
invoke
the
privilege.
he
cautioned
her
that
she
would
be
obliged
to
answer
and
directed
her
to
do
so.
it
was
only
after
these
preliminary
set
further
inquiry
that
he
concluded
that
there
had
been
a
contempt
or
a
series
of
contempt
to
which
he
treated
as
one.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
the
judge
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
point
of
it
is
that
he
can
proceed
as
he
did
to
determine
the
issue
of
contempt
immediately
under
rule
42
(a).
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
without
notice
and
hearing
as
required
by
rule
42
(b).
rule
42
(a)
says
that
it
occurs
in
the
presence
--
in
the
face
of
the
court,
then
the
judge
may
dispose
of
it
then
and
there.
42
(b)
says
if
it
occurs
not
in
the
face
of
the
court,
that
the
disposition
shall
be
on
notice
from
hearing.
and
that's
obviously
his
concern.
he's
saying,
"of
course,
it's
in
the
face
of
the
court,
therefore,
i'm
going
to
dispose
of
it
this
morning
along
with
the
rest
of
the
case."
now,
this
had
been
contempt
by
a
willful
disobedience
of
a
kind
which
took
place
outside
the
court
and
he
had
to
ascertain
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
whether
the
disobedience
had
in
fact
occurred.
he'd
have
to
do
it
on
notice
from
hearing
and
then
hear
in
the
evidence
that
the
parties
might
wish
to
present
on
the
issue
of
disposition.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
think,
presence
in
the
court
may
have
relevance
for
one
or
two
purposes.
one
purpose
is
the
merely
procedural
one
whether
you
proceed
summarily
or
on
notice
from
hearing.
now,
presence
of
the
court
--
presence
in
the
court
may
also
be
relevant
as
to
whether
substantively,
it
is
a
contempt
because
misbehavior
of
certain
kinds
is
a
contempt
if
committed
in
the
presence
of
the
court
but
not
a
contempt
if
committed
outside
the
court.
i
opposed
if
a
lawyer
says,
"i
think
judge
so
and
so
is
a
bad
judge,"
and
he
says
it
in
the
courtroom,
it's
clearly
a
contempt
that
he
thinks
--
says
he
is
a
bad
judge
and
he
says
it
on
the
street
corner
it's
not
a
contempt.
and
that's
the
significance
at
present
in
the
subsequent
case
then.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
catch
that.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
think
that
disobedience
of
any
lawful
order
of
the
court
is,
by
definition,
obstructive.
and
i
think
that's
why
subparagraph
(3)
doesn't
speak
about
obstruction.
subparagraph
(1)
deals
with
a
quite
distinct
matter.
it
doesn't
deal
with
the
matter
of
disobedience,
it's
talking
about
misbehavior.
it
may
be
making
a
loud
noise.
it
--
it
may
be
a
--
using
offensive
language,
may
be
any
number
of
things.
it's
not
disobedience
to
the
specific
order
but
it's
misbehavior
which
may
take
a
hundred
different
forms.
as
to
that,
the
statutes
says
specifically
for
obvious
reasons,
it
has
to
be
committed
in
the
presence
of
the
court.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
assume
that
is
also
that.
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
say
that
there
is
an
obstruction
in
any
instance
in
which
there
is
a
refusal
to
comply
with
a
lawful
order
because
i
think
that
an
order,
in
order
to
be
lawful
or
ruling,
in
order
to
be
a
lawful
ruling,
must
be
one
which
has
some
demonstrable
purpose
in
terms
of
the
exercise
of
the
court's
jurisdiction
and
function.
otherwise,
it's
not
a
lawful
ruling.
the
court
can't
make
frivolous
rule.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
would
draw
an
--
a
distinction
and
i
think
it
is
an
extremely
important
one
not
only
for
this
case
but
for
many
others,
perhaps,
a
distinction
between
what
may
be
critically
damaging
and
what
is
obstructive
to
the
judicial
process.
now,
i
think
it
would
be
a
fantastic
result
if
in
the
case
of
a
witnesses
refusing
to
be
sworn
or
to
testify,
the
question
of
whether
that
was
an
obstruction
or
a
disobedience
within
the
contempt
statute
had
be
--
had
to
be
determined
by
evaluating
how
the
case
might
have
come
out
if,
in
fact,
he
had
testified.
i
don't
think
it's
any
less
a
contempt
for
a
witness
to
refuse
to
testify
in
a
situation
in
which
it
ultimately
appears
by
hindsight
that
it
didn't
affect
the
result,
then
it
is
in
the
case
in
which
it
may
have
affected
the
result.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
right.
certainly,
the
government
here
--
the
result
here
was
not
affected
as
--
as
matters
proved
because
the
--
the
judgment
went
against
this
petitioner.
but
i
--
as
i
say,
i
don't
think
that
you
can
evaluate
the
contentious
nature
of
a
refusal
to
obey
a
court
order
or
refusal
to
be
sworn
or
refusal
to
testify
by
attempting
the
impossible,
in
many
situations,
to
estimate
what
bearing
or
effect
it
might
have
had
on
the
ultimate
outcome
of
the
case.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
think
in
a
broad
sense,
certainly,
every
case
of
perjury
is
also
an
obstruction.
i
think
your
honor
said
that
in
michael,
as
i
recall
rightly.
now,
i
think
that
the
important
difference
between
hudgings
and
michael
and
this
case
is
that
the
court
felt
that
there
would
be
serious
consequences
and
for
various
reasons
in
permitting
a
case
of
perjury
to
be
treated
by
the
contempt
process
rather
than
by
the
criminal
law
process
which
was
applicable
to
it.
the
court
pointed
to
several
factors
as
i
recall
in
hudgings
and
michael.
one
of
them
was
that
if
a
judge
could
threaten
a
witness
and
perhaps,
“threaten”
is
--
is
an
unfortunate
word
here,
a
judge
could
take
a
position
which
would
seem
to
the
witness,
to
threaten
the
witness
with
liability
and
contempt.
if
the
witness
failed
to
satisfy
the
judge's
notions
of
what
proof
was,
then
there
would
be
a
great
danger
to
the
court
stated
in
hudgings
that
the
contempt
power
could
be
used
to
shape
the
testimony
of
--
of
witnesses.
a
judge
might
have
a
--
a
strong
opinion
as
to
where
the
proof
lays.
and
if
he
were
permitted
to
say
to
a
witness,
“i
think
you're
--
you're
lying
about
this,
and
i
may
hold
you
in
contempt
unless
you
convince
me
that
you're
going
to
tell
the
truth,”
there
would
be
an
instrument
for
serious
perversion
of
justice
this
court
said
in
hudgings.
of
course,
there
are
other
good
reasons
for
not
treating
perjury
by
other
contempt
process.
perjury
is
certainly
a
--
an
offense
which
is
peculiarly
difficult
to
prove
than
has
in
its
serious
possibilities
for
miscarriage
of
justice
in
view
of
the
fact
that
people's
versions
and
memories
as
to
events
may
differ
so
widely.
it's
for
that
reason
that
this
court
has
insisted
on
the
application
of
the
so-called
two-witness
rule
in
perjury
cases.
finally,
i
think,
there
is
a
considerable
reluctance
on
the
part
of
the
court
to
--
and
has
been,
to
permit
or
encourage
use
of
the
contempt
process
where
the
criminal
law
is
clearly
applicable
and
offers
a
wholly
satisfactory
remedy.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
if
this
is
a
contempt,
it's
not
a
--
if
this
is
not
a
contempt,
it's
not
any
offense
at
all.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i'm
using
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
statute
defines
several
classes
of
contempt
of
which
this
is
one.
i'm
talking
about
--
i'm
drawing
a
distinction.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
am
saying,
your
honor,
that
so
far
as
i
understand,
the
only
charge
which
could
be
made
against
somebody
who
refuses,
like
mrs.
brown
did,
to
testify,
would
be
a
charge
of
contempt.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
the
trial
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
under
the
statute
that
is
--
that
may
be
a
trial
in
which
one
can
demand
a
jury,
the
contempt
of
congress
provision.
i'm
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
pardon?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
is
there
any
difference
between
a
trial
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
as
to
contempt
of
congress?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i'm
--
i
was
saying,
your
honor,
that
there
is
a
specific
statute
setting
forth
a
technical
crime,
a
common
law
crime
of
perjury
and
if
that
ought
not
be
used,
as
i
try
to
think
to
be
the
burden
of
this
court's
opinion
in
hudgings
and
michael
that
statute
should
be
utilized
in
all
cases
falling
within
it
in
such
acts
even
though
they
may
also
be
obstructions
of
the
court
should
not
be
dealt
with
by
the
contempt
power.
now,
i
take
it
that
both
in
hudgings
and
michael,
it
appears
to
me
that
the
court,
itself,
is
clear
on
the
proposition
that
where
as
perjury
should
be
prosecuted
under
the
perjury
statute
that
a
refusal
to
testify
or
a
refusal
to
be
sworn
as
a
witness
would
be
punishable
as
a
contempt.
there's
been
a
great
deal
of
discussion
about
hudgings.
i'd
like
to
take
the
time,
if
i
may,
to
read
two
sentences
from
that
opinion.
i'm
reading
from
page
382
of
the
report,
your
honor,
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
“that
the
contumacious
refusal
of
a
witness
to
testify
may
so
directly
obstruct
a
court
in
the
performance
of
its
duty
as
to
justify
punishment
for
contempt
is
so
well
settled
as
to
need
only
statement.”
and
in
the
next
sentence,
“despite
some
confusion
caused
by
certain
ambiguous
forms
of
expression
used
by
the
court
below
in
dealing
with
the
subject,
it
is
indisputable
that
the
punishment
for
contempt
was
imposed
solely
because
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
that
the
witness
was
willfully
refusing
to
testify
truthfully,
that
is
was
committing
perjury.”
now,
i
take
it
that
hudgings
means
that
a
refusal
to
testify
as
a
contempt
but
that
the
court
may
not
use
the
contempt
power
merely
because
it's
convinced
that
a
witness
is
testifying
untruthfully
and
say,
“now,
that's
obstructing
the
judicial
process.”
i
take
hudgings
to
mean
that
in
the
latter
case,
the
court
must
refer
the
matter
to
the
united
states
attorney
and
to
judge
an
indictment
for
perjury?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
--
i
would
have
to
answer
that
question.
i
think
first
excluding
the
words
without
relevance
or
importance
or
materiality
because
i
--
i'm
not
suggesting
that
an
order
which
has
no
basis
to
the
violation
of
such
an
order
is
a
contempt.
i
think
the
statute
requires,
section
401
requires
that
it
be
a
lawful
order
of
the
court.
i
don't
think
in
order
to
give
testimony
which
obviously
has
no
relation
to
the
proceeding
with
be
beyond
attack.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
there's
a
duty
to
respect
the
judge's
order.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
i
think
there
has
to
be
someone
in
the
courtroom
who
has
the
power
of
making
a
ruling.
and
if
that
ruling,
if
the
judicial
process
is
to
go
on
has
to
has
certain
importance
to
it.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
and
jail,
of
course,
isn't
the
only
punishment
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
(inaudible)
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
to
the
contempt
power.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
your
honor,
we've
listed
at
page
7,
and
this
is
in
response,
i
think,
to
your
--
about
your
question.
page
7
of
our
supplementary
brief,
some
10
cases
in
which
there
was
a
claim
of
privilege
in
which
the
district
court
ruled
that
the
claim
was
ill
taken
in
which,
as
a
result,
the
person
claiming
the
privilege
was
held
in
contempt.
now,
those
cases
run
the
--
the
ones
with
selected,
i
think,
but
probably
the
most
important
cases
on
questions
of
waiver
or
privilege.
they
run
from
brown
against
walker
down
to
the
recent
ullmann
immunity
statute
case.
now,
in
every
one
of
those
cases,
the
way
in
which
the
validity
of
the
claim
of
privilege
was
tested
when
it
was
overruled
by
the
court
was
by
the
person
being
held
in
contempt
and
taking
an
appeal.
i
certainly
don't
think
it
will
be
said
that
in
those
10
cases,
most
of
which
were
decided
by
divided
courts
that
the
claim
of
privilege
was
wholly
unsubstantial.
there
were
serious
questions.
i
think
much
more
serious
questions
than
are
raised
by
the
claim
in
this
case.
i
say
the
historical
way
of
raising
the
question
of
a
claim
of
privilege
once
that
it
has
been
denied
has
been
by
appeal
from
a
sentence
for
contempt.
now,
it
seems
to
me
fundamental
that
if
a
court
is
to
function,
that
it's
ruling
has
to
have
a
certain
amount
of
force
and
then
person
who
is
going
to
challenge
the
validity
of
a
judge's
ruling
does
so
at
his
peril.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
sir.
i
think
the
validity
of
any
citation
and
sentence
for
contempt
rest
upon
it
being
a
lawful
order
ruling
man
of
the
court.
lawful
is
written
into
401
(3).
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
and
what
i
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
he
--
if
he
is
going
to
say
"i
will
follow
your
ruling,
judge,
because
i
think
you're
wrong,"
i'd
say
he
runs
the
risk
that
on
appeal,
the
judge
will
be
found
right
and
that
he
will
be
found
wrong.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
interpret
hudgings,
your
honor,
as
meaning
that
the
reason
there
has
to
be
something
extra
in
the
case
in
which
a
witness
is
testifying
untruthfully
that
the
reason
for
that
is
that
because
--
is
because
there
would
be
grave
danger
in
punishing
the
ordinary
offense
of
perjury
through
the
contempt
power.
now,
i
don't
read
michael
as
being
different
in
that
respect
because
the
court
in
its
michael's
opinion
distinguished
a
case
known
as
united
states
against
appel,
a
district
court's
decision
by
judge
learned
hand.
now,
appel
was
distinguished
in
michael,
and
i'm
quoting
this
court's
opinion
in
distinguishing
it
because
there,
that
is
in
appel,
the
court
thought
that
the
testimony
of
appel
was
on
its
mere
face
and
without
inquiry
collaterally
not
a
bona
fide
effort
to
answer
the
question
at
all.
in
other
words,
i
would
take
it
from
hudgings
and
michael
that
where
their
refusal
is
a
refusal
to
answer
at
all
or
a
refusal
to
be
sworn
that
that
is
a
contempt
and
indeed,
reachable
only
by
the
contempt
process.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
judge
hand
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
that
--
it's
interesting
in
what
connection
he
said
it.
he
said
that
now,
perfectly
clear
that
if
the
contempt
of
the
refusal
is
to
answer
at
all.
and
then
he
went
on
to
say
that
the
court
ought
not
to
be
put
off
by
a
transparent
sham
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
where
there
is
an
answer
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
but
it's
obviously
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
not
responsive.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
you
get
into
a
very
troubled
scenario
when
you
try
to
distinguish
between
an
answer
which
is
no
answer
or
an
answer
which
is
so
equivocal
that
you
don't
believe
that
it's
responsive
and
an
answer
which
may
be
truthful.
perhaps
it's
wise
where
there
is
some
attempt
to
answer,
to
insist
that
the
proceeding
be
by
perjury.
i
would
say
to
the
court
that
the
only
way
in
which
there
can
be
any
sanction
against
a
person
who
doesn't
answer
at
all
is
by
the
contempt
power.
and
i
would
think
it's
astonishing
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
the
contempt
power
has
always
been
utilized
when
a
witness
has
refused
to
testify
in
court,
before
an
administrative
agency,
before
a
legislative
body
if
there
would
be
any
doubt
of
the
application
of
the
contempt
power
to
every
situation
in
which
a
witness,
without
justification,
refuses
to
answer.
i
agree
that
the
question
has
to
be
relevant.
i
agree
that
the
course
has
no
contempt
if
the
matter
was
privilege.
but
i
think
when
you
decide,
if
you
should,
that
the
questions
posed
on
cross-examination
were
relevant
and
that
there
was
no
privilege
to
refuse
to
answer,
i
think
you've
decided
that
the
ingredients
of
section
401
(3)
has
been
satisfied.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i
meant
to
cite
it
to
the
proposition
that
the
court
distinguished
that
how
and
certainly,
therefore,
i
would
take
it
deciding
anything
more
than
the
matter
of
contempt
by
perjury.
it
wasn't
purporting
to
decide
certainly
since
appel
was
distinguished
the
question
of
contempt
by
refusal
to
respond.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
it
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
the
court
is
saying
that
there
must
be
something
special
where
the
offense
is
the
giving
of
untruthful
testimony
to
induce
the
court
to
treat
it
as
a
contempt
rather
than
as
a
perjury
offense.
i
do
not
think
it
follows
from
that,
your
honor,
that
the
government
need
to
establish
anymore
where
there
is
the
refusal
to
answer
or
a
refusal
to
testify
than
that
the
order
to
testify
was
the
lawful
order.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
if
hudgings
and
michael
are
--
create
that
difficulty
or
sense
of
difficulty,
it
seems
to
me
the
answer
maybe
to
go
through
the
whole
course
of
cases
which
didn't
involve
perjury
but
involve
refusals
to
be
sworn
or
refusals
to
testify.
now,
i
know
no
case
in
which
it
is
suggesting
even
remotely
that
in
the
case
of
a
refusal
to
testify,
there
is
a
duty
to
examine
anymore
than
the
question
whether
the
order
to
testify
was
a
lawful
order.
it
never
been
a
suggestion
that
you
are
to
consider
or
that
the
district
court
is
to
consider
how
valuable
the
testimony
would
have
been
had
it
been
given
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
or
how
obstructive
the
effect
might
have
been.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
say,
yes,
that
is
it.
i
would
say
that
any
violation
of
the
lawful
order
is
--
is
per
se
obstructive
if
you
feel
that
you
need
obstruction.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
where
perjury
is
involved,
it
is
under
the
court's
holding
to
be
dealt
with
as
perjury
unless
there
are
exceptional
elements
which
also
make
it
contempt.
i
would
think
that,
logically,
when
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
i
can
conceive
of
perjurious
testimony
also
being
offensive
to
the
judge
containing
offensive
remarks.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
i
--
i
think
they
would
have
to
be
--
it
has
to
be
combined
with
another
element.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
right.
i
don't
think
you
treat
perjury
as
such
as
a
contempt.
i
take
that
to
be
the
holding
of
hudgings
and
michael.
a
final
word
about
the
subparagraphs
of
the
contempt
statute,
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
one
should
consider
whether
it
might
also
be
included
under
subparagraph
(1)
because
i
think
that
it
is
defined.
the
kind
of
offense
we're
dealing
with
here
is
defined
by
subparagraph
(3)
and
whether
it
might
also
be
included
in
something
else,
i
think
it
ought
to
be
dealt
with
under
the
heading
which
specifically
covers
it
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
i
shall.
i
think
that
some
of
the
elements
which
were
referred
to
earlier
whether
the
--
it
appears
to
the
court
that
the
claim
may
have
been
in
good
faith.
well,
i
don't
think
it's
a
defense
on
the
issue
was
there
a
contempt.
i
think
it
is
a
factor
which
may
be
considered
in
determining
the
reasonableness
of
the
sentence.
i
would
say
here
that
the
circumstances
that
the
reason
that
the
petitioner
adopted
this
course
of
conduct,
i
find
rather
difficult
to
explain
whether
it
was,
on
the
one
hand,
a
complete
misapprehension
or
on
the
other,
a
--
a
striving
for
some
fault,
some
conceived
advantage,
i
--
i
don't
know.
i
think
the
sentence
was
a
severe
one
in
the
circumstances.
i
don't
think
that
it's
not
fair
to
said
that
i
think
it
goes
beyond
the
range
of
the
district
judge's
discretion.
i
suppose
that
in
a
case
of
this
kind,
an
estimate
of
the
motive
which
may
have
led
to
this
course
of
conduct
by
a
witness
and
probably
be
better
made
by
the
district
judge
than
by
anybody
who
--
who
later
reads
the
record,
i
don't
know
what
further
to
say
on
--
on
the
subject
of
the
severity
of
the
sentence.
i
--
i
think
that
ultimately,
these
questions
attend
so
much
on
personal
judgment
as
to
what
would
be
reasonable
under
the
circumstances.
i
do
agree
with
what
was
said
earlier
by
government
counsel
in
the
yates
and
what
i
had
occasion
to
say
yesterday
and
i
dealt
in
the
green
and
wilson
case
that
i
think
there's
no
doubt
that
the
--
that
the
court
has
exercised
in
the
past
the
power
to
supervise
sentences
in
contempt
cases.
i
think
the
potentiality
of
abuse
in
contempt
cases
is
probably
greatest
where
the
judge
becomes
personally
involved
because
there's
a
sense
of
some
disrespect
or
to
him.
there
is
no
suggestion
of
that
in
this
case.
there
is
no
suggestion
by
petitioners
that
this
judge
was
personally
involved
with
the
use
of
anything
but
temperate
in
--
in
his
conduct
of
the
proceeding.
i
think
i
have
--
don't
have
anything
to
add.
