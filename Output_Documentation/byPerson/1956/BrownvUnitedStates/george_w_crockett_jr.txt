mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
represents
another
facet
of
the
problem
faced
by
both
lawyers
and
judges
in
determining
when
there
has
been
a
waiver
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
and
when
there
has
not
been
such
a
waiver.
perhaps
a
brief
statement
of
the
facts,
notwithstanding
they're
not
in
dispute,
will
serve
to
set
forth
the
setting
in
which
the
legal
issue
arises.
the
contempt
citation
arose
out
of
a
denaturalization
trial
in
which
it
was
alleged
that
the
petitioner
who
was
naturalized
in
detroit
in
1946
had
been
within
the
10-year
period
prior
to
her
naturalization,
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
and
that
she
had
not
disclosed
such
membership,
and
for
that
reason
was
guilty
of
having
procured
her
citizenship
either
illegally
or
by
fraud
by
wilful
misrepresentation
rather.
the
answer
filed
by
the
petitioner
denied
these
charges.
now
in
the
course
of
the
trial,
the
government
called
the
petitioner
to
the
witness
stand
and
attempted
to
gain
from
her
some
admissions
concerning
her
alleged
membership
in
the
communist
party.
it
is
apparent
i
think
from
an
examination
of
the
transcript
of
that
portion
of
examination
that
petitioner
upon
the
advice
of
her
counsel
had
decided
to
answer
all
questions
that
had
to
do
with
her
activity
prior
to
her
naturalization
in
november
1946
under
the
theory
that
certainly
any
alleged
incriminating
facts
would
be
outlawed,
shall
i
say,
by
the
statute
of
limitations.
but
she
had
also
decided
not
to
answer
any
questions
with
respect
to
such
alleged
activities
after
november
1946
relying
upon
her
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment.
so
that
in
the
course
of
her
direct
examination
by
the
government,
she
admitted
that
in
her
youth,
she
had
been
a
member
of
the
young
communist
league,
but
that
she
become
dissociated
with
the
young
communist
league
in
1935,
the
early
part
of
1935
which
of
course
would
be
more
than
10
years
before
her
petition
for
a
naturalization
which
was
not
filed
until
i
believe
it
was
august
1946.
the
government
also
asked
her
questions
that
had
to
do
with
the
post-1946
period
and
as
to
all
of
those
questions,
she
relied
upon
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
trial
court
sustained
her
reliance
upon
the
fifth
amendment.
but
i
should
like
at
this
point
to
point
out
one
fact.
there
were
several
questions
put
to
the
government
in
the
course
of
this
examination
under
the
rule
which
were
not
in
terms
limited
to
the
pre-1946
period
and
embraced
both
the
pre-1946
as
well
as
the
post-1946
period.
for
example,
petitioner
was
asked
whether
or
not
she
was
acquainted
with
certain
former
communist
who
has
become
professional
informers.
she
was
also
asked
if
she
knew
what
the
michigan
school
of
social
science
is,
a
well-known
communist
party
school.
now
those
questions
were
not
limited
in
time.
she
answered
with
respect
to
each
of
those
questions
and
it
was
after
those
answers
had
been
given
that
she
relied
upon
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
trial
court
sustained
her
reliance
upon
the
fifth
amendment.
the
trial
court
in
sustaining
that
reliance
refer
to
this
court's
opinion
in
blau.
but
if
we
will
examine
this
court's
opinion
in
blau,
we
will
find
that
this
court
was
adhering
to
the
rule
laid
down
in
the
arndstein
case,
a
rule
that
heretofore
has
been
deemed
applicable
to
everyone
except
the
accused
in
a
criminal
case
in
determining
when
there
is
and
when
there
is
not
a
waiver.
i
shall
come
to
a
more
complete
discussion
of
the
rule
in
the
arndstein
case
later.
but
i
simply
want
to
emphasize
that
notwithstanding
petitioner
had
answered
some
of
the
questions
that
related
to
both
pre
and
post-1946,
the
trial
court
sustained
her
privilege.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
government's
case,
the
petitioner
was
called
to
the
stand
by
her
own
counsel.
here
again,
it
is
apparent
from
the
examination
of
the
transcript
that
a
conscious
effort
was
being
made
to
limit
her
examination
to
the
pre-1946
period.
as
a
result,
she
testified
that
during
this
period,
she
was
never
a
member
of
a
communist
party,
that
she
was
a
member
of
the
young
communist
league,
but
that
she
left
that
organization
in
january
1935.
now
as
frequently
happens
in
some
of
these
cases
notwithstanding
counsel
is
conscious
of
the
time
sequence,
some
of
his
questions
seemed
to
ignore
the
time
sequence,
so
that
when
he
began
to
ask
petitioner
again
concerning
the
truthfulness
of
the
answers
given
in
her
petition
for
naturalization
such
as,
“would
she
take
up
arms
in
defense
of
this
government?
does
she
belong
to
any
organizations
that
teach
and
advocate
the
overthrow
of
a
government
by
force
and
violence?”
his
questions
were
not
limited
in
time
and
petitioner's
answers
to
those
questions
were
not
limited
in
time.
for
example,
one
question
that
comes
to
my
mind
was,
“you
answered
that
question
in
the
negative
in
your
petition
and
you
say
that
was
a
truthful
answer
then?
is
it
a
truthful
answer
now?”
and
the
petitioner
said,
“yes,
that's
a
truthful
answer
now.”
so
we
have
in
these
series
of
questions
not
only
what
amounts
to
a
protestation
of
loyalty
in
the
period
prior
to
1946.
that
protestation
is
carried
over
into
the
period
post-1946
and
it
is
because
of
this
carrying
over
effect
of
the
answers
to
these
questions
that
the
court
of
appeals
came
to
the
conclusion
that
that
constituted
a
waiver
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
and
it
was
on
that
basis
that
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
now
in
the
--
in
the
course
of
her
cross-examination
by
the
government
while
she
was
on
the
stand
voluntarily,
the
first
question
put
to
her
was,
“are
you
now
or
have
you
ever
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party?”
she
relied
upon
the
fifth
amendment.
the
trial
court
after
argument
stated
its
conclusion
more
or
less
in
these
words.
he
stated
that
he
believe
that
the
same
rule
that
is
applied
to
the
accused
who
voluntarily
takes
the
stand
in
a
criminal
case
should
be
applied
to
the
defendant
in
a
civil
case
who
voluntarily
takes
the
stand.
and
that
therefore
when
you
voluntarily
take
the
stand
as
a
defendant
in
a
civil
case,
by
that
act,
you
waive
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment.
so
petitioner
was
judged
guilty
of
contempt
and
sentenced
to
a
term
of
six
months.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
declined
to
pass
on
that
question.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
the
trial
court,
your
honor,
did
not
deal
with
the
answers.
he
stated
specifically
and
i'm
quoting
now
from
the
transcript
page
38.
he
stated
that
petitioner,
“had
waived
the
right
to
claim
any
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment
by
reason
of
having
testified
as
a
witness
in
her
own
behalf.”
that's
where
he
refers
to
the
question
of
testifying.
but
at
the
time
that
he
cited
her
for
contempt,
he
put
it
on
the
basis
of
her
having
taken
the
stand.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
and
again
in
his
certificate,
i
think
he
uses
the
term,
“she
haven't
taken
the
stand.”
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
i
would
disagree.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
i
can
see
how,
your
honor,
might
possibly
reach
that
conclusion
but
where
he
repeats
over
and
over
in
the
course
not
only
of
his
first
adjudication
of
contempt
but
also
in
his
certificate
that
by
reason
of
taking
the
stand,
you
waive
and
where
he
draws
the
analogy
to
the
accused
in
a
criminal
case,
i
think
the
inference
is
a
compelling
one
that
his
ruling
is
based
upon
her
taking
the
stand
and
not
upon
her
having
answered
any
questions
as
far
as
she
was
on
the
stand.
now
i
want
to
deal
with
the
validity
of
the
trial
court's
ruling
against
the
rule
which
we
submit
the
trial
court
was
required
to
apply
in
this
case.
the
rule
as
laid
down
by
this
court
in
the
arndstein
case
and
there
were
two
arndstein
cases.
the
first
arndstein
case
was
an
appeal
from
a
denial
of
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
a
bankruptcy
proceeding
where
the
accused
had
filed
schedules
and
then
in
the
course
of
his
examination
concerning
those
schedules,
he
claimed
the
protection
of
a
fifth
amendment.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
that's
the
opinion
as
reported
in
254
u.s.
at
page
71.
in
there,
this
court
rested
its
--
its
decision
squarely
upon
its
holding
that
the
schedules
contained
and
i
quote,
“no
admissions
of
guilt
are
furnished
clear
proof
of
crime.”
now,
we
need
not
go
into
a
consideration
of
what
is
meant
by
clear
proof
of
crime.
i
submit
that
there,
the
court
was
really
saying
unless
there
has
been
a
prima
facie
case
of
crime
established
by
virtue
of
the
answers
given
by
the
witness
to
the
questions.
certainly
with
respect
to
this
proceeding,
there
is
nowhere
here
any
admission
of
guilt.
there
is
nowhere
here
any
clear
proof
of
crime
based
upon
the
answers
given
by
the
petitioner
to
the
questions
concerning
her
loyalty.
now
also
in
the
arndstein
case
following
the
court's
setting
forth
of
this
rule,
there
was
a
petition
for
reargument
and
this
court's
opinion
there
as
recorded
at
254
u.s.
at
page
379.
in
that
reargument,
the
government
urged
a
reconsideration
of
that
rule.
this
court
however
said
and
i
quote,
“our
conclusion
concerning
the
constitutional
question
presented,
we
think
is
so
plainly
correct
that
a
reargument
would
be
unprofitable.”
the
petition
for
reargument
is
denied.
in
following
that,
the
lower
court
issued
the
writ
and
discharged
arndstein.
and
the
government
then
took
an
appeal
from
that
order
of
the
lower
court
and
that
is
the
opinion
of
this
court
that
is
recorded
at
262
u.s.
at
page
355.
now,
on
that
appeal,
the
government
contends,
and
the
contention
is
very
similar
to
the
contention
that
they
make
here.
they
said
that
arndstein
had
waived
his
privilege
because
and
i
quote,
“he
had
before
refusing
to
answer
the
questions
in
issue
testified
of
his
own
accord
without
invoking
any
privilege
to
the
very
matter
with
which
these
questions
were
concerned.”
and
the
district
court
in
its
opinion
refers
to
arndstein's
testimony
as
constituting
denials
and
partial
disclosures.
this
court
however
adhered
to
its
rule
set
forth
in
the
first
opinion.
and
it
again
held
that
there
was
no
waiver
unless
and
until
there
had
been
an
admission
of
guilt
or
furnished
clear
proof
of
crime.
now
what
is
significant
is
that
in
reaching
that
decision,
the
court
relies
very
heavily
upon
two
cases,
one
was
a
new
york
case,
foster
against
the
people
and
the
other
was
a
--
rather
michigan
case,
foster
against
people
and
the
other
was
a
new
york
case,
people
against
forbes.
and
this
is
what
this
court's
said
about
foster
versus
people.
in
foster
versus
people,
18
michigan,
266,
the
court
while
holding
that
a
witness
who
has
voluntarily
admitted
his
guilt
of
a
criminal
offense
is
not
protected
from
further
disclosures
on
the
same
subject.
he
said
that
if
he
has
not
actually
admitted
criminating
facts,
he
may
unquestionably
stop
short
at
any
point
and
determine
that
he
will
go
no
further
in
that
direction.
now,
much
has
been
made
in
the
government's
brief
about
drawing
a
distinction
between
a
witness
who
is
voluntarily
on
the
stand
and
one
who
is
testifying
involuntarily.
i
gather
from
their
brief
that
they
do
not
challenge
the
application
of
the
arndstein
rule
to
a
witness
who
is
testifying
involuntarily,
but
they
said
should
not
be
applied
--
pardon
me
--
where
the
witness
voluntarily
takes
the
stand.
significantly
however
in
foster
versus
people,
the
very
case
that
this
court
relied
on
in
establishing
the
rule
in
arndstein,
the
witness
there
had
voluntarily
taken
the
stand.
he
was
an
accomplice.
he'd
given
a
statement
to
the
prosecution
and
the
prosecution
had
called
him
as
a
witness.
the
court,
certainly
in
effect
is
saying
but
for
the
fact
that
in
the
course
of
your
testimony
you
have
already
incriminated
yourself
by
admitting
your
participation
in
this
crime.
you
would
have
been
able
to
stop
short,
but
since
you
have
admitted
your
guilt
or
furnished
clear
proof
of
crime,
you
must
go
on.
i
cite
that
only
to
emphasize
that
not
only
was
the
rule
not
limited
in
foster
versus
people,
to
cases
where
the
witness
took
the
stand
involuntarily.
but
this
court
did
not
so
limit
it
even
in
the
arndstein
case.
now
this
court
also
referred
as
i
mentioned
before
to
the
new
york
case
of
people
versus
forbes
which
is
very
interesting
because
there,
the
witness
and
i
shall
quote
what
the
court
said,
what
this
court
said
rather
in
summarizing
that
case.
in
people
versus
forbes,
143
new
york
219,
38
n.e.
303,
it
was
held
that
a
witness,
by
answering
questions
exonerating
himself
in
general
terms
from
all
connection
with
a
criminal
transaction
does
not
thereby
waive
his
right
to
remain
silent
when
it
is
thereafter
sought
to
draw
from
him,
circumstances,
which
might
form
another
link
in
the
chain
of
facts
capable
of
being
used
to
his
peril.
in
the
forbes
case,
the
defendant
--
the
witness
rather
had
taken
the
stand
and
he
had
denied
any
connection
with
the
crime
which
had
to
do
with
i
think
it
was
homicide
that
resulted
from
some
chemical
experiments
or
pranks
on
the
part
of
students.
but
he
had
also
testified
that
he
was
a
student
in
the
chemistry
class
with
one
of
the
other
suspects
and
that
he
had
a
knowledge
of
the
gas
that
was
being
used
and
so
forth.
it
was
following
those
admissions
that
he
relied
upon
the
privilege
and
his
reliance
upon
the
privilege
was
sustained
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
now
finally,
getting
back
again
to
the
arndstein
case.
in
summarizing
the
basis
for
its
holding,
this
court
said,
in
short,
it
is
apparent
not
only
from
the
language
of
the
former
opinion
but
from
its
citations
that
this
court
applied
to
the
non-incriminating
schedules
the
rule
in
the
cases
cited
namely
that
where
the
previous
disclosure
by
an
ordinary
witness
is
not
an
actual
admission
of
guilt
on
criminating
facts.
he
is
not
deprived
of
the
privilege
of
stopping
short
in
his
testimony
whenever
he
may
fairly
tend
to
incriminate
him.
and
although
there
is
some
conflict
of
authority
as
to
the
application
of
this
rule,
we
see
no
reason
for
departing
from
its
recognition
in
the
former
opinion
and
think
that
it
is
a
sound
rule
which
should
be
applied
to
the
involuntary
examination
of
a
bankrupt
where
he
is
practically
in
the
position
of
a
witness
under
cross-examination.
and
since
we
find
that
none
of
the
answers
which
had
been
voluntarily
given
by
arndstein,
either
by
way
of
denials
or
partial
disclosures,
amounted
to
an
admission
or
showing
of
guilt,
we
are
of
opinion
that
he
was
entitled
to
decline
to
answer
further
questions
when
so
to
do
might
tend
to
incriminate
him.
but
notwithstanding
the
court's
opinion,
the
government
was
not
satisfied
and
petitioned
this
court
for
a
fourth
rehearing
and
reargument
in
the
arndstein
case.
and
that
is
recorded
at
266
u.s.
at
page
16.
and
in
this
petition,
the
government
argued
that
the
privilege,
fifth
amendment
privilege,
should
not
extend
to
the
examination
of
a
bankrupt
made
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
possession
of
his
property.
and
what's
more,
the
government
also
argued
that
the
privilege
and
i
quote,
“does
not
apply
in
any
civil
proceeding.”
and
this
court,
speaking
through
mr.
justice
brandeis
said
the
following.
the
contrary
must
be
accepted
as
settled.
the
privilege
is
not
ordinarily
dependent
upon
the
nature
of
the
proceeding
in
which
the
testimony
is
sought
or
is
to
be
used.
it
applies
a
right
to
civil
and
criminal
proceedings
wherever
the
answer
might
tend
to
subject
to
criminal
responsibility,
him
who
gives
it.
the
privilege
protects
the
male
witness
as
fully
as
it
does
one
who
is
also
a
party
defendant.
and
so
in
conclusion
with
respect
to
the
trial
court's
ruling
in
this
case,
it
would
appear
that
the
trial
court
correctly
followed
the
ruling
of
this
court
while
the
witness
was
on
the
stand
as
an
involuntary
witness.
but
for
some
reason,
he
seems
to
have
concluded
that
the
rule
in
arndstein
did
not
apply
where
the
witness
took
the
stand
as
shall
we
say
a
voluntary
witness.
now
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
in
her
own
defense,
that's
true.
the
trial
court
therefore
by
implication
is
limiting
this
court's
rule
in
arndstein
to
those
cases
where
a
party
voluntarily
takes
the
stand
in
its
holding
--
or
rather
i
misspoke
myself.
a
trial
court
is
limiting
arndstein
to
those
--
those
cases
in
which
a
party
who
voluntarily
takes
the
stand
in
a
civil
proceeding
and
saying
that
in
that
case,
arndstein
does
not
apply,
but
that
where
the
party
is
called
to
the
stand
against
his
or
her
will,
arndstein
does
apply.
now
let's
examine
that.
in
the
first
place,
my
examination
has
failed
to
uncover
and
the
government
has
not
suggested
in
any
of
its
briefs,
any
such
limitation
of
the
arndstein
rule
made
by
this
court.
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
absence
of
any
such
holding
is
itself
a
potent
reason
for
concluding
that
such
is
not
the
law.
but
i
agree
that
we
should
have
perhaps
a
little
more
compelling
reasons
than
just
the
absence
of
authority.
what
then
is
meant
by
compulsion
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment?
is
the
fifth
amendment
addressed
to
all
compulsion
or
is
it
addressed
to
compulsion
to
testify
to
incriminating
matter?
i
suggest
that
it
means
the
latter
and
that
therefore
compulsion
to
testify
means
compulsion
to
testify
to
incriminating
matter.
and
this
compulsion
can
arise
only
where
there
is
a
direction
to
give
evidence
that
is
claimed
to
be
incriminatory.
but
you
cannot
decide
whether
or
not
a
particular
question
or
a
particular
bit
of
evidence
is
incriminatory
until
after
the
witness
has
been
sworn
and
has
taken
the
stand.
it
is
familial
law
that
you
cannot
claim
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment
before
you
were
sworn
and
you
cannot
claim
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment
until
you
have
acquainted
the
court
either
by
argument
or
by
prior
testimony
with
the
setting,
which
makes
possible
the
validity
of
your
claim
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
this
cannot
happen
until
after
the
witness
takes
the
stand.
i
suggest
further
that
if
we
follow
the
government's
theory,
it
would
excuse
all
witnesses
from
coming
in
voluntarily
to
testify
upon
the
simple
claim
that
any
testimony
they
would
give
might
tend
to
incriminate
them.
and
we
would
be
relegated
to
the
proposition
where
every
witness
would
have
to
be
subpoenaed
to
come
into
court
in
order
to
get
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment
with
respect
to
that
portion
of
his
testimony
which
might
be
deemed
incriminating.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
no,
i
wouldn't
say
that
the
defendant
would
then
subpoena
himself.
i
think
we
would
have
what
if
anything
amounts
to
an
even
more
tragic
situation
presented
by
this
case.
in
the
norm
of
denaturalization
case
where
the
issue
is
one
of
a
political
belief,
the
only
person
who
can
testify
as
to
the
defendant's
belief
is
the
defendant
himself.
now
if
you
are
saying
to
the
defendant,
if
you
voluntarily
take
that
stand,
you
waive
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment.
then
in
effect,
you're
telling
him
that
you
will
not
permit
him
to
be
heard
in
his
own
defense
in
this
critical
area
and
i
question
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
i
would
disagree
with
your
statement
of
the
facts,
your
honor.
the
defendant
did
not
testify
fully
and
freely
the
whole
gamut
of
the
case.
the
defendant
limited
her
testimony
on
the
issue
of
communist
party
membership
to
the
period
prior
to
1946.
she
did
not
testify
with
respect
to
those
issues
as
they
presented
themselves
in
the
period
after
1946.
and
with
respect
to
the
period
prior
to
1946,
she
answered
all
of
the
questions.
it
is
only
in
that
area
where
she
gave
general
answers
protesting
her
loyalty
that
the
court
of
appeals
spells
out
a
waiver.
now
the
court
of
appeals
when
we
come
to
its
decision
predicates
its
claim
of
a
waiver
upon
an
application
of
this
court's
opinion
in
the
raffel
case.
the
raffel
case
was
discussed
in
the
previous
argument
and
i
need
not
summarize
its
facts.
but
i
believe
the
court
of
appeals
committed
error
in
holding
that
the
test
which
this
court
says
applies
to
the
accused
in
a
criminal
case
is
to
be
carried
over
and
applied
to
a
defendant
in
a
civil
case
because
first,
this
court
has
said
that
the
waiver
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
is
not
likely
to
be
inferred.
it
must
be
predicated
upon
a
conscious
election
that
is
plainly
inconsistent
with
the
claim
of
a
waiver.
now,
let's
compare
the
status
of
the
accused
in
a
criminal
case
with
that
of
the
defendant
in
a
civil
case
and
see
if
there
is
there
any
justification
for
carrying
the
rule
applicable
to
the
accused
over
to
the
defendant
on
a
civil
case.
in
the
first
place,
in
the
criminal
case,
the
accused
not
only
has
a
privilege
against
incriminating
himself,
he
has
a
privilege
against
being
called
to
testify.
the
defendant
in
a
civil
case
has
no
such
privilege.
when
the
accused
therefore
voluntarily
takes
the
stand,
he
is
consciously
casting
aside
his
privilege
against
being
compelled
to
give
incriminating
testimony
and
he
knows
when
he
takes
the
stand
that
the
primary
object
of
the
cross-examination
is
to
incriminate
him.
the
party
defendant
in
a
civil
case
has
no
such
notice.
he
has
no
such
knowledge.
he
has
no
basis
for
any
such
anticipation.
so
there
is,
applying
the
general
principles
that
they
normally
apply
where
we
are
spelling
out
a
waiver
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
a
basis
for
saying
that
there
is
a
waiver
of
the
accused
who
voluntarily
takes
the
stand,
whereas
there
is
no
basis
for
saying
that
there
is
a
conscious
election
or
waiver
on
the
part
of
a
party
defendant
who
takes
the
stand
in
a
civil
case.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
i
would
say
you'd
have
to
examine
it
in
the
setting
in
which
the
question
was
asked
and
whether
you'd
have
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
question
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
--
possibly
called
for
an
incriminating
answer.
if
so,
then
he
would
be
entitled
to
claim
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
i
suppose
he
could.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
yes.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
that
i
would,
your
honor.
what
you're
really
asking
me
is
whether
in
that
i
agree
with
rogers
versus
united
states.
i
think
in
each
instance,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
there
has
been
an
admission
of
guilt
or
the
furnishing
of
clear
proof
of
crime.
i
would
say
for
example
in
rogers
that
there
was
no
admission
of
guilt
because
there
was
quite
a
bit
more
that
the
government
would
have
to
be
--
have
to
prove
granted
the
fact
that
--
that
mrs.
rogers
testified
to
before
it
could
sustain
a
conviction
under
the
smith
act
for
example
but
take
this
case,
we
would
have
to
know
specifically
what
it
is
she
is
admitting
to.
so
that
if
for
example
she
admitted
not
only
that
she
was
a
member
of
a
communist
party
in
the
post-1946
period.
but,
and
this
is
very
important
that
she
knew
the
communist
party
to
be
an
organization
that
taught
and
advocated
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence,
which
she
has
already
denied
here
and
which
was
not
even
admitted
in
rogers.
and
that
she
had
the
specific
intents
to
overthrow
the
government
of
the
united
states
while
she
was
a
member,
which
this
court
has
said
is
an
ingredient
of
any
criminal
prosecution
under
the
smith
act.
if
she
admitted
all
of
that,
then
i
would
say
clearly
there
has
been
a
waiver.
now
the
next
question
is
where
can
she
go
short
of
that?
the
answer
to
that
is
that
i
don't
know.
this
court
has
said
in
the
blau
case
that
she
could
admit
membership
in
the
communist
party
and
that
would
not
be
a
waiver.
but
in
the
rogers
case,
it
went
on
to
say,
if
she
admitted
membership,
officership,
and
discuss
freely
her
activities,
that
is
a
waiver.
i
don't
know
that
i've
been
very
helpful
to
you
in
answer
of
your
question
but
i
think
i
have
at
least
pointed
out
the
problem
that
we
practitioners
are
confronted
with
in
advising
witnesses
concerning
their
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment
in
the
light
of
this
court's
opinion
in
the
rogers
case.
let
me
point
out.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
i
don't
think
it's
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
go
that
far.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
i
think
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
well,
i
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
i
think
here
it's
conceded
that
the
question
was
a
privilege
question
and
that
--
but
for
the
fact
that
the
court
concluded
there
had
been
a
waiver,
she
would
have
been
entitled
to
claim
her
privilege.
in
the
case
which
mr.
justice
brennan
gave,
i'm
not
so
sure
that
the
question
was
a
privilege
question.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
well,
certainly
prior
to
the
time
that
he
relied
on
the
fifth
amendment
if
we
applied
the
arndstein
rule,
there
had
been
no
admission
of
guilt
on
his
part.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
i
would
say
that
under
arndstein,
the
plaintiff
could
claim
his
fifth
amendment
privilege.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
and
he
should've
been
sustained.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
that's
right.
that's
correct.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
there's
any
rational
basis
for
the
plaintiff's
division
of
time
in
the
hypothetical
situation
that
you
give.
presumably
he's
not
answered
--
he
cannot
be
incriminated
with
respect
to
the
period
prior
to
the
accident.
there
is
no
claim
with
the
privilege
presented
there.
it
only
comes
up
after
the
accident
with
respect
to
that
entire
area.
he
says
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
--
"i'm
not
going
to
answer
any
question,
the
answer
to
which
might
incriminate
me."
and
if
he
adheres
to
that
position,
i
believe
that
his
claim
of
the
privilege
would
have
to
be
sustained.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
regardless
of
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
--
where
it
was
in
point
of
time.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices.
the
petitioner
here
is
a
48-year
old
woman
who
is
employed
as
a
waitress
in
a
restaurant
herein
to
the
working
class
people
in
the
city
of
detroit.
she
knows
practically
nothing
about
the
constitution
or
the
fifth
amendment
except
perhaps
what
she
has
seen
on
tv
or
what
her
attorney
told
her
in
connection
with
this
trial.
the
attorney,
judging
from
the
record,
was
not
too
experienced
himself
with
the
interpretations
of
the
fifth
amendment,
and
there
are
certain
definite
areas
of
misjudgment,
i
would
say,
that
will
immediately
occur
to
the
court
as
you
examine
this
record.
the
judge
who
tried
the
case,
with
a
very
recent
appointee
to
our
district
court
bench,
i
am
not
too
sure
but
what
this
was
not
his
first
contested
trial
and
i
am
sure
this
was
the
first
time
he
was
called
on
to
exercise
the
drastic
power
of
criminal
contempt.
now,
it
was
this
combination
of
circumstances
which
gave
rise
to
the
case
that
we
have
before
us
today,
our
case
which,
in
my
humble
opinion,
never
should
have
been
in
court.
i
recall
when
i
first
appear
before
this
court,
i
think
it
was
mr.
justice
frankfurter
who
made
the
comment
to
me
that
sometimes
justice
is
the
appearance
of
justice.
and
later
in
offutt
against
united
states,
i
believe
the
majority
opinion
repeats
that
very
appropriate
statement.
i
entered
this
case
in
the
appeal
stage
and
i
conceive
it
to
be
my
function
to
suggest
possible
reasons
in
law
by
which
this
court
might
right
the
injustice
that
occurred
in
this
case.
of
course,
i
am
assuming
that
the
court
agrees
with
me
that
there
has
been
an
injustice
and
it's
incumbent
upon
me
to
point
that
out.
now,
as
to
the
facts,
the
petitioner
was
born
in
poland.
she
migrated
to
the
united
states
at
the
age
of
two
in
1911.
she
has
lived
in
the
united
states
ever
since.
her
formal
education
seized
with
the
seventh
grade
at
which
time
she
was
15
years
old
and
she
had
to
go
to
work.
i
think
the
record
clearly
indicates
that
throughout
her
life,
she
has
identified
herself
with
so-called
oppressed
people
in
our
social
order
and
particularly
with
the
members
of
the
working
class.
her
testimony
admits
that
during
her
youth
and
during
the
period
of
the
depression,
this
identification
was
so-called
oppressed
causes
led
her
to
become
a
member
of
the
young
communist
league,
which,
i
understand,
was
the
junior
section
of
the
communist
party.
she
denies
that
she
was
ever
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
also
in
her
youth,
she
married
a
man,
who,
i
believe
the
record
bears
us
out,
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
and
in
january
1935,
her
husband
was
expelled
from
the
communist
party
and
it
was
at
that
time
that
she
ceased
to
be
active
in
the
young
communist
league.
in
1946,
she
made
application
for
citizenship
under
the
provisions
of
the
nationality
act
of
1940.
that
act
prohibited
the
naturalization
of
anyone
who,
within
the
period
of
10
years
prior
to
his
application,
had
been
a
member
of
any
organization
teaching
anarchy
or
the
disbelief
in
organized
government.
petitioner,
in
the
course
of
her
naturalization
process,
did
not
reveal
that
she
had
been
a
member
of
the
young
communist
league.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
she
registered
in
1940
under
the
alien
registration
act,
there
was
a
question
there
that
inquired
what
organizations
have
you
belonged
to
in
the
past
five
years,
and
she
did
not
indicate
in
answering
that
question
that
she
had
been
a
member
of
the
young
communist
league.
now,
come
the
passage
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952
which
permits
the
revocation
of
naturalization
wherever
the
government
is
able
to
show
a
willful
misrepresentation
or
concealment
of
a
material
fact,
the
government
filed
its
complaint
for
denaturalization
in
the
district
court
at
detroit.
the
essence
of
that
complaint
is
that
petitioner
was
guilty
of
a
fraud.
in
that,
in
her
application
for
citizenship
and
in
the
processes
leading
up
to
the
grant
of
citizenship,
she
had
not
revealed
her
former
affiliation
with
the
young
communist
league
and
with
the
communist
party.
now,
that
case
came
on
to
be
tried.
and
here,
we
see
the
first
error
of
judgement,
i
believe,
that
was
made
by
a
trial
counsel.
since
denaturalization
is
a
civil
proceeding,
the
government
was
permitted
under
the
rules
to
call
the
defendant
to
the
stand
as
a
witness.
the
course
of
the
government's
examination,
both
the
dependent
and
her
counsel
made
it
abundantly
clear
that
with
respect
to
all
of
the
questions
relating
to
her
organizational
affiliations
that
were
limited
in
point
of
time
to
the
period
prior
to
her
1946
naturalization,
she
would
answer
those
questions.
but
as
to
the
organizational
affiliations
subsequent
to
1946,
she
would
rely
upon
her
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment.
there
is,
i
believe,
a
rational
basis
for
that
distinction.
certainly,
this
court
has
held
in
the
(inaudible)
case
that
questions
intended
to
elicit
from
a
witness
an
admission
of
membership
in
the
communist
party
are
questions
which
might
tend
to
incriminate
into
that
extent
the
privilege
is
available.
it
is
also
true,
however,
that
with
respect
to
a
showing
of
a
possible
offense
which
is
outlawed
by
the
statute
of
limitations
as
certainly
a
smith
act
offense
predicate
upon
activity
prior
to
1946
would
be
outlawed,
the
privilege
would
not
apply.
so
as
i
say,
there
was
a
sound
legal
basis
from
making
that
distinction,
the
trial
court
was
aware
of
it.
and
throughout
petitioner's
examination
under
the
rule,
the
trial
court
recognized
her
right
to
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment.
at
the
conclusion
of
petitioner's
examination
under
the
rule,
her
attorney
requested
leave
to
delay
her
cross-examination
until
after
the
government
had
completed
its
case
in
sheet.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
to
delay
her
cross-examination.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
rather
than
to
call
her
as
his
own
witness,
she
was
a
witness
for
the
government.
and
under
the
rule,
even
her
own
attorney
was
entitled
to
cross-examine
her
with
respect
to
the
testimony
she
had
given
while
she
was
on
the
stand
as
a
witness
for
the
government.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
no.
i
say
he
requested
permission
to
delay
his
cross-examination
until
after
the
government
had
completed
its
case
in
sheet.
the
trial
court
denied
that
request.
now,
at
that
point,
counsel
for
the
petitioner
had
a
choice
of
either
to
go
on
with
this
cross-examination
at
that
time
when
it
was
abundantly
clear
that
there
could
be
no
subsequent
contention
that
there
was
a
waiver
by
taking
the
stand
or
he
could
excuse
the
petitioner
and
recall
her
as
his
own
witness
after
the
government
rested.
i
think
it
was
an
error
in
tactics,
trial
tactics
that
he
didn't
proceed
with
his
cross-examination
at
that
time
because,
as
i
examined
the
record,
there
isn't
one
thing
that
he
was
able
to
bring
out
on
her
direct
examination
as
his
own
witness
that
he
could
not
have
brought
out
by
cross-examining
her
while
she
was
a
witness
for
the
government,
perhaps
the
first
one
of
these
errors
that
has
given
rise
to
this
case.
petitioner
was
excused
from
the
stand
and
the
government
subsequently
produced
two,
possibly
three
witnesses,
all
of
whom,
i
believe
i
am
correct
in
saying,
fall
in
the
category
of
paid
informers
that
are
frequently
used
by
the
government
in
denaturalization
proceedings
in
that
particular
area.
their
testimony
was
to
the
effect
that
petitioner
not
only
had
been
a
member
of
the
young
communist
league
but
that
she
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
they
brought
that
period
of
membership
up
to
a
point
subsequent
to
the
date
of
her
naturalization
in
1946.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
government's
case,
petitioner's
counsel
then
called
petitioner
as
his
witness
and
there
is
no
question
in
the
record
that
that's
precisely
what
he
did.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
was
some
colloquy
with
the
court
and
the
court
made
sure
that
the
record
reflected
the
fact
that
petitioner
was
now
taking
the
stand
as
a
witness
called
back
her
own
counsel.
and
now,
we
come
to
the
second
tactical
error
made
by
counsel.
knowing
that
the
court
would
prepare
to
go
along
with
his
view
that
the
privilege
could
be
claimed
with
respect
to
all
questions
that
were
limited
--
let
me
begin
that
again.
knowing
that
the
court
was
prepared
to
go
along
with
his
view
that
the
privilege
was
available
with
respect
to
the
membership
prior
to
1946
or
alleged
communist
party
activity
prior
to
1946,
he
tried,
in
the
course
of
his
examination
of
his
client,
to
limit
his
questions
to
that
period
but
he
made
one
or
two
mistakes
in
such
a
limitation
and
they
are
in
the
record,
and
i
have
set
them
forth
in
a
footnote
in
our
main
brief
and
i
believe
it
appears
on
pages
5
to
6,
certain
questions
that
he
put
to
her
as
his
witness
which
were
not
limited
in
time.
take
for
example
this
question.
referring
to
her
petition
for
naturalization
which
she
already
had
identified
and
it
said
that
she
answered
the
questions
as
therein
stated,
counsel
asked
her
“in
question
28,
you
were
asked
"are
you
a
believer
in
anarchy
or
the
unlawful
damage,
injury
or
destruction
of
property
or
sabotage?"
and
you
answered,
"no."
"was
that
a
true
answer
to
that
question?”
and
the
witness
then
answered,
“that
was
the
true
answer.”
and
then
counsel
said,
“you
say
it
was
not
only
a
true
answer
at
that
time,
you
filed
the
petition
july
16th,
1946,
and
is
that
the
true
answer
today?”
so
he's
coming
down
to
a
period
subsequent
to
1946.
and
there
are
two
or
three
other
instances
in
which
the
same
error
of
judgement
has
made
and
it
is
that
error
of
judgement
that
is
relied
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
affirming
the
conviction
below.
now,
after
petitioner
had
completed
her
direct
examination
as
a
witness
called
by
her
own
counsel,
the
government
was
entitled
to
cross-examine
and
the
first
question
put
to
her
on
cross-examination
was,
"are
you
now
or
have
you
ever
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party?"
with
respect
to
the
portion
of
that
question
that
has
to
do
with
"have
you
ever
been?"
obviously,
that
had
been
answered
because
when
she
was
a
witness
for
the
government,
she
had
categorically
denied
that
she'd
ever
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
not
withstanding
she
had
admitted
membership
in
the
young
communist
league.
it
is
the
other
part
of
the
question,
“are
you
now,”
of
course
perhaps
a
part
of
the
second
half
or,
“have
you
ever
been
a
member?”
because
that
portion
certainly
related
to
the
period
subsequent
to
1946.
as
to
that,
the
petitioner
claimed
her
privilege.
the
trial
court
ruled
and
i
think
it's
pretty
clear
that
she
had
waived
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment
by
voluntarily
taking
the
stand
as
a
witness
in
her
own
behalf.
i
recalled
when
i
argued
this
case
before,
mr.
justice
whittaker
raised
the
question
whether
or
not
it
was
really
correct
to
say
that
that
was
a
basis
of
the
trial
court's
ruling.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
on
the
contrary,
you
did.
yours
was
the
first
question,
and
i'll
always
remember
that.
if
you
will
examine
the
transcript
at
pages
33
to
34
and
again
at
page
40,
you
will
see
that
the
trial
court
was
most
specific.
it
was
his
view
that
the
rule
with
respect
to
the
waiver
in
criminal
cases
should
also
apply
in
civil
cases
and
that
as
soon
as
a
person
voluntarily
takes
the
stand
in
a
civil
case,
these
is
a
waiver
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
uphold
the
trial
court
in
that
calling
nor
did
it
disagree
with
the
trial
court
in
that
holding.
instead,
the
court
of
appeals
said
regardless
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
waiver
when
she
took
the
stand,
there
was
a
waiver
based
on
her
prior
testimony
that
having
undertaken
to
speak
concerning
the
question
of
organization
or
affiliations
on
her
direct
examination,
she
was
compelled
then
to
submit
to
cross-examination.
in
effect
then,
what
the
court
of
appeals
is
saying
is
that
we
must
apply
in
our
interpretation
of
the
fifth
amendment
the
same
rule
that
is
customarily
applied
in
the
law
of
evidence
that
whatever
doors
are
open
on
direct
examination
remain
open
for
purposes
of
questioning
on
cross-examination.
that,
i
submit,
has
never
been
the
rule
of
this
court
and
i
rely
on
this
court's
opinion
in
the
arndstein
cases
that
are
cited
in
my
brief.
i
don't
want
to
take
the
time
to
review
that
facts
in
those
cases.
i
do
want
to
point
out
that
certainly,
when
the
same
question
is
presented
to
this
court
on
four
different
occasions
between
the
same
litigants
and
the
court
adheres
to
its
ruling,
the
court
must
be
convinced
of
the
correctness
of
that
ruling.
the
ruling
in
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
i
see.
thank
you.
the
ruling
in
arndstein
was
to
this
effect
that
in
a
civil
proceeding,
a
witness
or
a
fraud
defendant,
who
takes
the
stand
whether
voluntarily
or
involuntarily,
does
not
waive
the
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment
unless
and
until
he
even
admits
guilt
or
gives
clear
proof
of
crime.
now,
that
was
the
holding
in
the
arndstein
case.
i'm
reminded
at
this
point
at
the
time
of
my
last
argument,
i
think
it
was
mr.
justice
brennan
who
questioned
me
about
the
arndstein
case
and
gave
me
a
hypothetical
case
that
really
carries
arndstein
to
its
outermost
limits.
it
was
suggested
that
i
consider
the
case
of
two
automobile
drivers
not
accompanied
with
passengers
going
in
opposite
directions
down
the
highway
and
colliding
with
the
result
that
one
driver
is
killed.
the
other
driver
brings
a
suit
against
the
administrator
of
the
estate
of
the
deceased
driver,
he
takes
the
witness
stand,
he
gives
his
version
of
how
the
accident
occurred
and
of
course,
it's
a
one-sided
version.
on
cross-examination,
he
was
asked
certain
questions,
i
presume
a
possible
answer
to
which
might
show
him
guilty
of
negligent
homicide.
and
so,
he
relies
upon
his
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment
and
refuses
to
answer.
the
justice
asked
me
under
those
circumstances
should
he
be
permitted
to
go
to
the
jury
on
his
one-sided
version
of
the
case,
and
my
answer
was
that
if
we
apply
the
arndstein
rule
as
this
court
announced
that
rule,
he
would
be
entitled
to
go
to
the
jury
on
even
that
one-sided
version
of
the
case
to
which,
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
mr.
justice
brennan
indicate
that
he
thought
it
was
most
unfair
and
then
the
chief
justice
inquired
if
it
was
necessary
to
go
that
far
in
this
case
and
i
answered
no
without
elaborating
upon
my
note.
i
want
to
suggest
that
in
such
cases,
certainly
the
state
courts
have
found
a
way
of
taking
care
of
a
situation
without
depriving
the
fifth
amendment
of
its
effectiveness
in
that
type
of
situation
because
the
state
cases
many
of
them
hold.
and
under
those
circumstances,
the
trial
court
has
justified
in
striking
that
portion
of
the
direct
testimony
which,
because
of
the
invocation
of
the
fifth
amendment,
is
not
subjected
to
cross-examination.
i
want
to
suggest
that
the
court
might
wish,
in
its
opinion
in
this
case,
to
consider
at
least
amending
the
arndstein
rule
to
the
extent
to
confirm
the
authority
of
the
federal
district
courts
to
do
essentially
the
same
thing
where
an
attempt
to
reconcile
the
constitutional
right
to
rely
upon
the
fifth
amendment
conflicts
with
the
constitutional
right
to
cross-examination.
now,
leaving
for
the
moment
the
lower
court's
decision
in
arndstein
or
before
leaving
it,
i
do
want
to
make
one
additional
point.
there
is
basis,
i
think,
to
conclude
from
the
examination
of
this
record
that
trial
counsel
for
the
petitioner
in
this
case
as
well
as
the
petitioner
was
really
misled
by
the
trial
court's
rulings
because
when
you
examine
the
record,
you
will
find
that
there
were
several
instances
for
the
trial
court
sustain
the
claim
of
the
fifth
amendment
or
held
that
there
had
not
been
a
waiver
not
withstanding
the
witness
that
answered
previous
questions
that
were
not
limited
in
time
to
the
period
prior
to
1946.
for
example,
the
witness
was
asked
concerning
certain
individuals
who
were
--
were
well-known
in
the
area
to
be
members
of
the
communist
party
and
who
were
expected
to
be
witnesses
in
this
particular
case,
she
was
asked
if
she
knew
a
person
whose
name
was
--
pardon
me,
virgil
stewart
or
bernice
baldwin
or
earl
reno.
now,
those
questions
were
not
limited
in
time.
she
wasn't
asked,
“did
you
know
them
before
1946?
just,
"did
you
know
them?"
and
with
respect
to
those
questions,
she
answered.
now,
if
we
apply
the
rule
which
the
court
of
appeals
later
applied,
we
would
have
to
conclude
from
that
that
she
had
opened
the
door
by
answering
the
questions
with
respect
to
her
associations
or
knowledge
and
so
forth
of
these
individuals.
and
to
that
extent,
she
had
waived
the
rule.
the
trial
court,
however,
and
i
think
it's
clear,
was
attempting
to
apply
the
rule
in
arndsted
--
in
arndstein
rather
and
was
saying
that
while
she
could
have
claimed
the
privilege
with
respect
to
those
questions
under
the
theory
that
an
answer
might
tend
to
incriminate
her,
the
fact
that
she
did
not
claim
the
privilege
did
not
amount
to
a
waiver
because
there
had
been
no
admission
of
guilt
or
clear
proof
of
crime.
in
other
words,
the
scope
of
the
area
within
which
the
privilege
can
be
claimed
is
not
necessarily
coextensive
with
the
scope
of
the
area
in
which
waiver
occurs.
in
short,
you
have
to
go
a
little
further
before
you
find
waiver
than
you
need
go
in
order
to
sustain
a
claim
of
a
privilege.
now,
let
me
consider
another
point
that
the
government
raises
in
its
brief
and
that
is
that
in
any
event,
the
rule
in
arndstein
should
be
limited
to
cases
where
the
witnesses
is
--
where
the
witness
is
an
involuntary
witness
on
the
stand.
the
government
does
not
deny
that
the
arndstein
rule
is
the
rule
to
be
applied
in
civil
proceedings.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
my
main
brief,
as
i
point
out
at
the
bottom
of
page
13,
the
government
filed
a
brief
in
the
rogers
case.
and
in
that
brief,
while
they
criticize
the
court's
ruling
in
arndstein,
they
said
this,
"where
the
witness
is
not
the
defendant
in
a
criminal
prosecution,
there
is
a
substantial
body
of
authority
that
testimony
as
to
a
transaction
waives
the
privilege
with
respect
all
other
inquiries
pertinent
to
that
transaction,”
which
is
what
i
call
the
open
door
rule
in
which
is
the
rule
that
was
applied
in
this
case
by
the
court
of
appeals,
but
the
government
continues,
“this
court
however
has
indicated
that
the
privilege
is
not
waived
merely
by
a
testimony
as
to
a
transaction.
and
that
before
the
witness
can
be
held
to
have
waived,
there
must
be
an
element
of
incrimination
in
what
he
has
disclosed."
now,
there
are
additional
reasons
why
you
can't
predicate
a
waiver
in
a
civil
case
upon
a
mere
taking
of
a
stand.let
me
mention
one
or
two
of
them.
first
of
all,
the
right
to
claim
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment
does
not
come
into
play
until
there
is
an
element
of
compulsion
to
testify
concerning
an
incriminating
matter,
not
simply
a
compulsion
to
testify,
but
a
compulsion
to
testify
concerning
an
incriminating
matter.
it
might
be
said
therefore
that
a
witness
who
appears
in
court
pursuant
to
a
subpoena
is
compelled
to
appear
and
is
compelled
to
testify
but
he
is
not
compelled
to
testify
as
to
an
incriminating
matter.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
i
suppose
only
a
witness
who
is
not
a
party
would
be
appearing
pursuant
to
a
subpoena.
and
so,
what
i'm
talking
about
is
an
involuntary
witness
using
the
time
to
mean
a
witness
who
is
appearing
pursuant
to
a
subpoena.
and
the
point
that
i'm
making
is
that
the
subpoena
itself
does
not
supply
the
element
of
compulsion
because
the
subpoena
does
not
compel
him
to
testify
to
incriminating
matter,
it
compels
him
to
come
in
and
testify
generally.
now,
it
is
not
until
he
claims
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
court
then
issues
a
directive
to
him
to
testify
concerning
this
matter
which
he
claims
of
incriminating
that
you
get
the
element
of
compulsion
so
that
the
right
to
claim
the
privilege
itself
does
not
arise
until
after
the
witness
is
on
the
stand
after
he
has
been
sworn
and
after
he
has
been
asked
the
question.
obviously,
up
until
that
point,
since
there
was
no
right
to
claim
it,
there
could
not
be
a
waiver
merely
by
taking
the
stand.
now,
there
are
certain
practical
difficulties
that
flow
from
any
holding
that
there's
a
waiver
by
taking
the
stand.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
no,
the
court
of
appeals
was
careful
to
point
out
that
it
was
not
passing
on
that
theory
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
--
used
by
the
trial
court.
the
court
of
appeals
went
on
the
theory
that
a
prior
testimony
itself
constituted,
i
presume,
an
admission
of
guilt
and
to
that
extent,
passes
to
it
a
waiver.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
that's
true,
but
i
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
--
i
feel
called
upon
to
also
point
out
why
the
district
court
was
wrong
because,
while
i
don't
think
it
was
likely
to
happen,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
specifically
say
that
the
district
court
was
wrong.
it
said,
"we
are
not
going
to
pass
on
that
question
now."
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
and
that's
what
i'm
coming
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
we
must
consider
the
record
in
the
sense
that
perhaps
the
petitioner
in
the
course
of
her
directive
testimony
while
she
was
a
voluntary
witness
on
the
stand
had
indicated
clearly
an
intention
to
waive
the
privilege
because
she
had
answered
questions
which
tended
to
incriminate
her.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
the
district
court
did
not.
the
district
court
made
a
finding,
if
you
want
to
call
it
that,
based
in
entirely
upon
her
voluntarily
taking
the
witness
stand.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
that
is
correct.
and
that
is
why
i
argue
in
my
brief
that
in
effect,
the
court
of
appeals
has
amended
the
certificate
which
the
district
court
was
required
to
make
because
under
the
federal
rules,
the
district
court
did
only
punish
them
merely
for
contempt
if
it
entered
a
certificate
setting
forth
all
of
the
facts
constituting
the
contempt.
there
was
at
least
one
fact
here
which
is
necessary
to
sustain
the
affirmance
by
the
court
of
appeals
but
which
was
not
made
by
the
district
court
and
that
is
what
i
call
a
factual
inference
that
the
witness,
because
of
her
answers
to
the
broad
questions
put
to
her
by
her
counsel,
indicated
an
intention
to
waive
the
fifth
amendment.
now,
the
trial
court
didn't
find
that.
the
trial
court
said,
"regardless
of
your
intention
as
a
matter
of
law,
once
you
take
the
witness
stand,
you
waive,”
and
that's
what
it
set
forth
in
the
certificate
to
the
extent
then
that
the
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
now,
let
me
explain
also
about
certificate,
your
honor.
we
don't
--
we
don't
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
i
certainly
do
want
to
say
that.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
correct.
it
failed
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
--
an
essential
factual
element
necessary
to
sustain
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
i
think
where
a
waiver
is
--
is
based
upon
an
inference
to
be
drawn
from
the
facts,
it
would
be
a
question
of
fact
and
not
a
question
of
law.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
well,
the
inference
could
be
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
now,
i
want
to
touch
briefly
on
some
other
facts
with
difficulties
that
we
get
into
when
they
say
that
there
is
a
waiver
as
soon
as
you
take
the
stand.
it's
generally
recognized,
i
think,
as
mid
law
that
the
claim
of
the
waiver
has
to
be
made
under
oath.
prior
to
the
time
that
the
witness
takes
the
stand,
he's
not
under
oath.
and
therefore,
he
is
in
no
position
to
claim
the
waiver.
it's
generally
recognized
also
that
the
claim
of
the
waiver
must
be
made
in
a
factual
setting
where
the
court
can
clearly
see
that
there
is
a
possibility
of
incrimination.
and
all
too
frequently,
that
factual
setting
will
not
appear
until
after
the
witness
has
taken
the
stand.
if,
therefore,
we
say
that
the
waiver
occurred
when
he
took
the
stand,
we
are
in
effect
compelling
him
to
--
to
prejudge
what
questions
are
going
to
be
put
to
him
and
whether
or
not
those
questions
will
call
for
a
possible
incriminating
answer.
now,
i
want
to
leave
the
trial
court
and
deal,
if
i
may,
with
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals,
as
i
point
out
earlier,
did
not
sustain
the
trial
court
in
its
contention
that
there
was
a
waiver
as
soon
as
my
client
took
the
witness
stand.
instead,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
"on
the
basis
of
the
general
answers
you
gave
on
the
questions
were
put
to
you
by
your
counsel
questions
that
were
not
limited
to
the
pre-1946
period,
we
believe
that
you,
in
effect,
opened
the
door."
that's
in
essence
what
the
court
is
saying.
“you
have
indicated
in
absence
of
fear
of
incrimination.
you
have
demonstrated
a
willingness
to
testify
in
this
particular
area.
and
having
done
that,
you
have
waived
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
you
must
subject
yourself
to
cross-examination
the
same
as
any
other
witness
would
do.”
now,
the
authority,
which
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
to
sustain
in
that
respect,
was
raffel
against
united
states,
a
case
which
has
come
in
recently,
i
think,
for
some
criticism
in
this
court.
in
the
grunewald
case,
it
was
considered
and
there
were
some
members
of
the
court
who
thought
that
it
should
be
overruled
but
i
believe
it
was
not
overruled
in
that
case
but
we
have
to
regard
it
as
still
the
law.
but
it's
still
the
law
with
respect
to
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
who
voluntarily
takes
the
stand.
it
cannot
be
the
law
with
respect
to
a
defendant
in
a
civil
case
and
takes
the
stand
unless
we
are
to
completely
ignore
arndstein.
my
second
point
in
connection
with
that
is
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
conceive
of
a
situation
where
a
witness
by
denying
guilt
by
saying,
"i've
done
nothing
that
is
incriminating,"
thereby,
waives
the
privilege.in
short,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
under
no
circumstances
can
a
negative
answer
to
the
question
that
is
supposed
to
be
an
incriminating
question
serve
as
the
predicate
for
a
waiver
because
by
virtue
of
the
question
being
negative,
the
witness
has
denied
that
there
is
any
guilt
whatever
associated
with
him.
so
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
i
think
she
can,
that's
the
whole
kind
of
my
argument.
and
at
the
--
it
bothered
the
court
of
appeals
because
they
said
the
government
is
entitled
to
examine
the
witness,
to
cross-examine
the
witness
on
this.
the
answer
to
that
is
that
the
constitution
has
said
the
government
is
not
entitled
in
this
limited
area
to
cross-examine
the
witness
unless
the
witness
voluntarily
agrees
to
do
so.
and
this
court
has
interpreted
that
constitutional
provision
as
saying
not
until
the
witness
has
admitted
guilt
or
given
clear
proof
of
crime
are
we
prepared
to
say
she
has
voluntarily
agreed
to
submit
the
cross-examination
in
that
area.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
well,
you
--
you
may
be
right.
i'm
inclined
to
think
that
you
are
right.
if
the
witness
has
admitted
guilt,
then
perhaps,
there
is
no
question
about
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
--
cross-examination
or
not.
but
i
have
to
take
the
law
as
i
think
trial
counsel
in
this
case
has
to
take
the
law
as
it
existed
at
the
time
the
case
was
tried.
and
as
of
that
time,
arndstein
said
there
is
no
waiver
until
there
is
either
an
admission
of
guilt
or
your
answers
have
furnished
clear
proof
of
crime.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
i
think
your
question
you
put
is
just
a
little
too
broadly.
there
would
be
some
areas
of
her
direct
examination
on
which
he
could
be
cross-examined.
but
if
the
question
itself
calls
for
an
answer
that
might
be
incriminating,
if
she
has
not
previously,
in
her
direct
examination,
given
clear
proof
of
crime,
she
can
stop
right
there
and
say,
"i
will
not
answer
that
question."
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
she
is
certainly
by
--
by
denying
guilt
has
not
given
any
clear
proof
of
guilt.
she
didn't
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
--
given
any
proof
whatever.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
no,
i
don't
say
that.
that's
why
i
am
amending
my
reply
to
mr.
justice
brennan
by
suggesting
that
this
court
might
do
as
the
trial
court
in
(inaudible),
a
case
cited
on
the
government's
brief,
suggested
that
it
had
the
power
to
do
and
that
is
to
strike
that
cross
--
that
--
that
direct
examination
that
is
not
subject
to
cross-examination
by
virtue
of
the
privilege
of
the
fifth
amendment.
in
other
words,
we
will
not
give
you
an
unequal
advantage
in
upholding
your
claim
of
the
fifth
amendment
nor
will
we
give
you
an
advantage.
we
will
strike
out
that
portion
of
the
testimony.
now,
also,
in
the
course
of
our
previous
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
i
don't
say
it.
the
constitution
says
it
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
--
that
if
in
that
area
you
entitled
the
claim
of
privilege,
is
the
choice
that
has
been
made
by
the
people
of
the
united
states.
and
it
has
to
be
changed
by
them
if
they
disagree
with
this
court's
interpretation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
no
person
shall
be
compelled
on
a
criminal
case
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
this
court
has
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
--
interpreted
that
to
mean
that
no
person
may
be
compelled
in
any
case
to
give
incriminating
evidence
which
might
later
be
used
against
him
in
a
criminal
case.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
he
is
not
compelled
to
give
incriminating
testimony.
that's
a
point
i
was
making
a
little
earlier.
the
compulsion
does
not
arise
until
he
claims
the
privilege
and
the
trial
court
overrules
his
claim
and
then
directs
him
to
answer.
he
is
then
being
compelled
to
give
evidence
which,
if
it
is
incriminating,
would
violate
his
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment.
now,
in
the
course
of
our
argument
here
before,
i
believe
it
was
mr.
justice
frankfurter
who
called
our
attention
to
this
court's
ruling
in
in
re
hudgings
with
the
suggestion
that
perhaps
the
element
of
obstruction
is
a
necessary
element
to
be
assumed
in
all
cases
where
it
is
sought
to
punish
someone
for
criminal
contempt.
i
would
like
now
to
address
myself
to
that
proposition,
and
i
began
with
a
flat
statement
that
i
interpret
in
re
hudgings
as
applying
to
all
criminal
contempts
in
the
federal
court
whether
they
are
under
section
1,
2
or
3
of
section
401.
i
am
aware
that
this
court,
during
the
course
of
a
previous
argument,
implied
if
there
was
any
decision
indicating
that
the
requirement
of
a
showing
of
obstruction
had
been
made
with
respect
to
a
contempt
predicate
upon
a
violation
of
subsection
(3).
i
must
confess
that
i
know
of
no
such
case.
but
i
do
know
of
one
case,
and
that's
clark
against
u.s.
it's
not
cited
in
my
brief.
that's
reported
at
289
u.s.
at
page
1
where
the
court
has
found
the
element
of
obstruction
necessary
in
order
to
uphold
a
charge
of
criminal
contempt
based
upon
a
violation
of
the
second
section
of
section
401.
that
second
subsection
refers
to
misconduct
on
the
part
of
any
officer
of
the
court.
in
the
clark
case,
there
was
involved
a
juror
who
had
given
false
answers
in
the
course
of
her
voir
dire
and
had
actually
concealed
some
of
the
facts.
and
in
the
first
holding
in
that
case,
the
opinion
was
written
by
mr.
justice
cardozo,
we
find
these
words,
“concealment
or
misstatement
by
a
juror
upon
a
voir
dire
examination
is
punishable
as
a
contempt
if
its
tendency
and
design
are
to
obstruct
the
processes
of
justice."
now,
in
as
much
as
the
court
has
found
no
statutory
difficulty
in
concluding
that
the
requirement
in
in
re
hudgings
concerning
obstruction
applies
to
subsection
(2).
i
don't
anticipate
that
there
would
be
any
difficulty
in
finding
that
also
applied
to
subsection
(3),
but
i
don't
predicate
my
argument
upon
that
alone.
a
rereading
of
ex
parte
hudgings,
i
think,
makes
the
point
additionally
clear.
for
there,
the
court
said,
"an
obstruction,”
and
i'm
reading
now
from
page
2
of
my
supplemental
memorandum,
"an
obstruction
to
the
performance
of
judicial
duty
resulting
from
an
act
done
in
the
presence
of
the
court
is
then
the
characteristic
upon
which
the
power
to
punish
for
contempt
must
rest.
this
being
true,
it
follows
that
the
presence
of
that
element
must
clearly
be
shown
in
every
case
where
the
power
to
punish
for
contempt
is
exerted.”
my
interpretation
of
in
re
hudgings
then
is
that
it
admits
that
no
exception
insofar
as
contempts
in
the
federal
court
is
concern.
counsel,
in
his
reply
brief,
dwells
primarily
upon
the
rule
at
common
law
and
that
at
common
law,
any
violation
of
a
court's
order
amounted
to
a
contempt
without
the
necessity
of
a
showing
of
obstruction.
the
first
answer
to
that,
of
course,
is
that
there
is
no
so
such
thing
as
a
common
law
contempt
in
federal
court.
there's
no
such
thing
as
inherent
power
of
a
lower
federal
court
to
punish
for
contempt.
its
power
must
be
gained
from
the
three
corners
--
four
corners
rather
of
section
401
and
only
then
as
interpreted
by
this
court.
and
in
hudgings,
this
court
has
said
and
this
court
repeated
in
in
re
michael
and
also
in
offutt.
this
court
calls
attention
to
the
pervading
effect
of
this
requirement
of
obstruction
as
applied
wherever
it
is
sought
to
punish
someone
for
a
federal
--
for
a
criminal
contempt
in
the
federal
court.
example
in
offutt,
this
court
said,
"the
pith
of
this
rather
extraordinary
power
to
punish
without
the
formalities
required
by
the
bill
of
rights
for
the
prosecution
of
federal
crimes
generally,
is
that
the
necessities
of
the
administration
of
justice
require
such
summary
dealing
with
obstructions
to
it.
it
is
a
mode
of
vindicating
the
majesty
of
law,
in
its
active
manifestation,
against
obstruction
and
outrage."
now,
it
was
suggested
in
the
course
of
the
trial
of
the
earlier
case
that
as
a
practical
matter,
every
refusal
to
obey
an
order
of
a
trial
court
really
amounts
to
an
obstruction
and
you
will
find
the
same
thought
expressed
in
in
re
hudgings,
and
i
believe
the
same
thought
is
expressed
in
in
re
michael.
but
this
court
made
it
abundantly
clear
that
that
falls
under
the
heading
of
incidental
obstruction
and
that
the
court
was
not
concern
there
with
incidental
obstruction.
it
meant
something
that
disrupted
the
processes
of
the
administration
of
justice
and
that
something
had
to
clearly
appear
from
the
record
in
the
case
and
had
to
--
i
would
say
had
to
clearly
be
found
by
the
trial
court
in
his
certificate.
otherwise,
he
has
not
set
forth
the
facts
constituting
the
alleged
contempt
which
is
required
whenever
he
seeks
to
punish
someone
summarily
for
a
criminal
contempt.
the
certificate
in
this
case,
and
there
is
no
formal
certificate
where
i
have
not
raised
the
issue,
i
believe,
the
trial
court
intended
that
his
opinion
had
served
as
his
certificate
because
he
specifically
directed
that
it
be
tied
up
and
handed
up
to
him
for
signature,
and
i
think
that,
perhaps,
was
a
substantial
compliance
with
the
requirement.
i
believe,
however,
that
if
the
court
is
not
prepared
to
say
that
the
element
of
obstruction
must
be
shown
in
every
case
of
criminal
contempt
whether
it'd
be
under
subsections
(1),
(2)
or
(3),
the
minimum
that
this
court
should
say
is
that
the
element
of
obstruction
must
be
clearly
shown
wherever
it
is
sought
to
punish
summarily
an
alleged
criminal
contempt.
and
i
say
that
because
i
think
the
rule
itself
makes
it
clear
that
the
congress
there
or
perhaps,
it
was
the
court
is
concerned
with
the
--
with
the
matter
of
having
a
certificate
filed
by
the
trial
judge
that
will
serve
as
one
and
the
same
time
as
both
the
indictment
charging
this
so-called
crime
as
well
as
the
judgment
itself.
the
requirements
of
due
process
would
require
that
in
any
such
indictment,
the
accused,
at
least,
is
entitled
to
know
that
conduct
on
his
part
which
is
alleged
to
have
constituted
the
crime.
and
if
in
re
hudgings
is
good
law,
and
i
submit
that
it
is,
one
necessary
element
of
that
would
be
a
finding
of
obstruction
and
there
is
no
such
finding
in
this
particular
case.
now,
my
final
point
has
to
do
with
the
overall
limitation
on
the
power
of
the
federal
courts
to
punish
for
contempt
and
that
limitation
was
first
expressed,
i
believe,
in
anderson
versus
dunn
where
this
court
used
the
term
“the
least
power
--
“the
least
possible
power
adequate
to
the
end
proposed”.
the
end
proposed
in
all
of
these
cases
is,
of
course,
the
removal
of
the
so-called
obstruction.
i
contend,
therefore,
that
in
this
case,
the
trial
court
did
not
used
“the
least
possible
power
adequate
to
the
end
proposed”.
if
he
had,
he
would
have
merely
stricken
the
testimony
on
direct
examination
without
applying
the
drastic
authority
to
punish
summarily
for
criminal
contempt.
i
suggest
further
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
trial
court
is
given,
under
the
statute,
this
question
to
determine
whether
the
alleged
conduct
will
be
considered
as
civil
or
criminal
contempt
does
not
necessarily
make
his
determination
of
that
issue
controlling.
and
that
in
a
given
case
where
the
obstruction
could
be
removed
by
treating
the
conduct
as
civil
contempt
and
therefore
not
punish
merely
as
drastically
as
criminal
contempt,
there
is
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
trial
court
to
do
that.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
i
can't
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
--
i
can't
tell
your
honor
what
the
practice
has
been
generally
in
state
courts.
i
can
only
refer
to
the
fact,
as
i
make
the
point
in
my
supplemental
brief
on
pages
8
and
9
that
certainly,
in
many
of
the
state
courts,
it's
recognized
that
the
court
under
such
circumstances
has
the
authority
to
strike
the
testimony
of
the
witness
who
was
relying
upon
the
fifth
amendment.
perhaps,
i
can
go
even
farther
and
say
that
that
american
law
institute,
basic
problems
of
evidence
by
professor
morgan
suggest
that
that
is
the
correct
way
to
handle
this
situation.
now,
as
far
as
striking
the
pleading's
concerned,
i
had
bother
that
the
threshold
by
this
court's
opinion
in
hovey
versus
elliott
where
the
court,
in
effect,
said
that
in
--
in
cases
such
as
this,
when
you
strike
the
part
as
pleading,
you
are,
in
effect,
denying
him
his
day
in
court
and
that
would
be
a
denial
of
due
process.
i
do
not
believe
that
hovey
versus
elliot
would
preclude
this
court
from
authorizing
the
lower
district
courts
in
these
cases
such
as
this
to
strike
the
part
as
testimony
in
direct
examination.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
of
the
--
the
--
if
i
remember
the
facts
then,
i'm
not
so
sure
that
i
do,
i
think
it
was
an
attempt
to
use
the
least
power
necessary
to
remove
the
obstruction
either
the
defendant
there
had
failed
to
--
to
testify,
maybe
i
shouldn't
try
to
remember
because
it
doesn't
clearly
to
mind
at
this
time
but
i
do
know
that
that
case
stands
for
the
proposition
that
the
federal
--
lower
courts
do
not
have
the
authority
to
strike
the
pleadings
and
go
on
and
proceed
to
judgment
by
default.
now,
in
any
event,
that
wouldn't
apply
the
denaturalization
proceeding
because
this
court
has
held
at
even
where
the
defendant
has
in
default
in
a
denaturalization
proceeding,
the
government
still
has
the
burden
of
proving
its
case
from
what
it
really
amounts
to
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
the
government
certainly
--
the
government
certainly
had
achieved
this
end
if,
in
the
first
place,
the
trial
court
disregarded
all
of
the
petitioner's
testimony
except
in
those
instances
where
it
was
corroborated
by
the
other
witnesses.
the
trial
court
had
no
difficulty
whatever
reaching
the
conclusion
that
--
that
the
petitioner's
citizenship
could
be
--
should
be
cancelled.
on
top
of
that,
the
government
has
already
completed
deportation
proceedings
in
order
this
woman
deported
to
poland.
now,
in
addition
to
that,
they
seek
to
sustain
here
a
sentence
of
six
months
because
of
her
refusal
to
answer
a
question
which
she
believed
and
which
her
counsel,
i
believe,
had
the
right
to
assume
was
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment.
your
honor
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
--
wrote
a
dissenting
opinion
in
rogers
case.
i
think
i
need
only
refer
to
it
to
indicate
that
this
case,
itself,
typifies
the
problems
that
we,
practical
lawyers,
have
in
trying
to
apply
the
meaning
of
the
doctrine
of
waiver
in
these
cases.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
i
think
the
rule
provides
there
that
the
answer
can
be
stricken.
i
think
it
does.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
i
think
the
answer
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
--
there
is
that
his
pleading
can
be
stricken
and
the
court
can
proceed
as
though
he
were
in
default.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
that
could
be
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
this
court
however
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
what
i
mean
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
what
i
mean
to
say
is
that
the
turn,
the
least
possible
power
at
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
i
would
say
that
in
the
case
where
an
ink
load
thrown
at
a
judge,
all
the
reasonable
men
would
agree
that
there
has
been
a
disruption
of
the
judicial
process.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
and
that
it
could
be
punished
summarily.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
do
i
understand
your
honor
asking
whether
or
not
in
that
case,
it
is
necessary
to
show
obstruction?
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
i
think
it's
uncommon
upon
the
court
under
the
court's
own
interpretation
and
i
refer
particularly
to
the
court's
opinion
in
the
nye
case
that
the
intent
of
congress
based
upon
the
happenings
in
connection
with
the
trial
of
judge
peck
indicated
an
intention
on
the
part
of
congress
to
limit
the
use
of
the
summary
contempt
power
to
those
situations
where
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
remove
the
so-called
obstruction.
and
if
it
was
not
necessary,
there
is
no
power
to
punish
summarily
for
contempt.
now,
that
doesn't
meant
that
the
individual
goes
--
got
free.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
i
would
suggest
that
the
same
test
applies
there
that
this
court
frequently
has
called
upon
to
apply
where
it
is
determining
whether
or
not
there
had
been
an
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
i
have
no
rebuttal,
your
honor.
