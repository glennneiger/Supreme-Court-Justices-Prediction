justice
brennan
was
he
under
arrest
when
he
was
taken
to
the
strong
room
at
the
hospital?
justice
brennan
under
arrest?
justice
brennan
now,
how
long
after
he
was
brought
to
the
hospital
did
you
say
the
first
statement
was
taken?
justice
brennan
and
the
first
--
the
questioning
--
the
first
questioning
was
not
at
the
hospital
or
what?
justice
brennan
at
the
hospital.
justice
brennan
now,
which
statements
is
it
that
were
introduced?
justice
brennan
and
how
long
had
elapsed,
two
days
before
he
made
that
statement?
justice
brennan
over
two
days.
now,
what's
the
other
statement
of
plaintiff?
justice
brennan
well,
are
you
arguing
at
all
that
the
--
to
bring
in
on
the
first
--
on
the
first
trial
on
the
murder
indictment,
a
conviction
of
second
degree
murder
is
no
better
than
as
they
brought
in
a
verdict
of
guilty
of
robbery
or
some
other
--
other
--
justice
brennan
well,
are
you
arguing
further
from
that
that
because
they
did
bring
in
an
entirely
impermissible
verdict
that
they
must
also
be
taken
to
have
acquitted
him
of
the
first
degree
murder
charge?
justice
brennan
so
that
on
that
ground,
he's
been
acquitted
of
the
first
degree
murder
charge
upon
which
they
tried
him
the
second
time
and
upon
which
he's
had
the
death
sentence.
justice
brennan
well,
is
that
an
argument
then
that
in
this
case,
his
appeal
from
the
utterly
invalid,
i
gather
you
considered
it,
verdict
of
second
degree
murder,
could
not
in
any
wise
be
constituted
as
a
waiver
of
the
acquittal
which
you
say
is
implicit
in
that
verdict
--
justice
brennan
--
on
the
first
degree
murder.
justice
brennan
--
i
know,
but
is
that
--
justice
brennan
--
is
that
what
you
--
justice
brennan
no,
but
my
question
is,
is
it
your
argument
that
the
second
degree
murder
verdict
which
was
appealed
was
utterly
invalid
and
as
indeed
the
circuit
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
held
and
set
it
aside.
but
you
say
the
appeal
from
that
verdict
was
not
in
any
wise
a
waiver
of
the
--
justice
brennan
--
acquittal
of
the
first
degree
--
justice
brennan
well,
i
--
i
thought
your
argument
was
he
was
more
than
just
in
jeopardy
that
he
was
in
fact
acquitted
of
the
first
degree
charge
in
the
first
trial.
justice
brennan
if
not
in
words
in
any
event
because
of
the
form
of
the
verdict
that
came
in.
justice
brennan
well
--
well,
why
put
it
that
way
if
in
fact
he
was
acquitted,
then
he
can't
be
tried
a
second
time
on
the
same
charge,
can
he?
whether
it's
acquittal
by
implication
or
expressly
or
otherwise?
justice
brennan
well,
are
you
taking
that
position
as
to
this?
justice
brennan
well,
mr.
blow,
in
this
instance,
if
on
the
first
trial
he'd
been
convicted
of
first
degree
murder
but
with
a
recommendation
for
a
life
sentence
and
then
had
appealed
for
trial
errors
or
otherwise
and
had
--
and
the
conviction
had
been
reversed.
you
have
no
doubt,
do
you,
that
he
could
have
been
tried
again
on
the
same
indictment
and
there
had
been,
the
verdict
brought
in
here
without
recommendation
and
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
brennan
there
--
there
is
none?
justice
brennan
i
know.
i
thought
--
doesn't
the
jury
here
on
a
first
degree
conviction
have
started
to
bring
in
a
recommendation?
justice
brennan
well,
that's
my
point.
so,
the
--
i
was
trying
to
distinguish
the
situation
i
put
to
you
from
this
one
which,
if
i
get
your
distinction,
would
be
that
that
here
in
effect
had
been
an
acquittal
on
the
first
degree
charge.
and
that
his
right
to
that
was
not
all
affected
and
the
advantage
of
that
acquittal
by
reason
of
his
appeal
from
the
impermissible
second
degree
verdict.
justice
brennan
isn't
that
your
position?
justice
brennan
now,
tell
me
mr.
blow,
is
--
is
trono
this
case
or
is
it
the
first
case
i
put
to
you,
that
is
where
there's
been
a
proper
first
degree
conviction
that
is
under
the
indictment
and
life
recommendation
and
then
the
successful
appeal
and
then
back
for
a
new
trial
on
the
same
indictment,
then
a
verdict
which
results
in
death.
is
that
trono?
justice
brennan
well,
let's
--
let's
say
then
--
then
trono
was
not
this
case.
trono
is
the
first
case
then,
the
hypothetical
case
i
put
to
you
and
were
nearly
that.
justice
brennan
yes.
justice
brennan
mr.
blow,
having
physical
difficulty
over
this
and
hearing
you
at
all.
justice
brennan
incidentally,
is
it
in
the
felony
murders?
is
it
death,
but
the
only
penalty
here?
justice
brennan
well,
i
was
thinking
that.
we
had
a
phrase
here
a
short
while
ago
that
--
justice
brennan
but
for
this
--
justice
brennan
but
for
--
is
it
for
all
felony
murders
or
just
arson
felony
murder
for
which
the
--
justice
brennan
and
that
automatically
follows
upon
conviction
--
justice
brennan
--
is
that
it?
justice
brennan
well,
mr.
sand,
is
--
was
the
second
degree
murder
under
this
indictment
or
under
the
statute
under
which
it
was
brought
an
includable
offense
at
all?
justice
brennan
well,
in
that
--
is
that
then
to
say
to
answer
me
that,
"no.
second
degree
murder
is
not
a
lesser
included
offense
under
this
indictment."
justice
brennan
no,
he
--
which
he
was
tried
on
the
same
indictment
both
times?
justice
brennan
and
under
second
degree
verdict,
under
that
indictment
--
justice
brennan
--
which
i
gather,
you
now
tell
me
under
that
indictment
at
least,
is
not
a
lesser
included
offense.
justice
brennan
well
then
--
then
tell
me.
on
the
first
--
from
what
you
read
us
now
from
this
opinion,
i
gather
that's
the
opinion
on
the
--
and
from
the
judgment
--
judgment
now
before
us
isn't
it?
justice
brennan
that
quotation
as
to
what
his
counsel
did.when
he
took
the
first
appeal,
did
he
affirmatively
seek
only
a
new
trial
or
did
he
take
the
position
that
he
had
in
fact
by
reason
of
the
form
of
the
verdict
returned
been
acquitted
of
--
of
the
murder
charge
in
the
indictment?
justice
brennan
well,
where
--
where
does
it?
where
does
the
court
of
appeals
get
all
this
stuff
about
his
--
worrying
about
a
new
trial
then
if
they
could
--
justice
brennan
as
on
oral
arguments?
justice
brennan
what
you're
telling
is,
he
never
did
urge
that
there's
been
an
acquittal
of
the
first
degree
charge
or
the
felony
murder
charge
--
justice
brennan
--
on
the
first
appeal?
justice
brennan
well
--
well,
tell
me
this.
suppose
as
i
suggested
to
your
adversary.
suppose
instead
of
bringing
in
a
verdict
of
second
degree
murder,
they
brought
in
a
verdict
of
robbery.
and
he
take
it
on
appeal
and
had
it
set
aside
on
the
same
ground
that
the
verdict
of
robbery
was
not
supportable
under
this
indictment.
could
he
be
tried
again
just
he
was
there?
justice
brennan
well,
i
thought
by
a
hypothesis,
the
instruction
here
was
utterly
erroneous.
justice
brennan
oh,
why
is
it
that
given
the
--
giving
the
government
a
second
crack
on
trying
upon
an
indictment
under
which
in
effect
he's
actually
even
acquitted?
justice
brennan
(inaudible)
say
that
over
again
mr.
sand,
do
you
say
initially
that
for
example,
had
there
been
this
conviction
on
the
arson
count
first
and
then
subsequently
a
trial
of
the
murder
count.
justice
brennan
that
then
the
murder
count
could
not
have
been
tried?
justice
brennan
well
isn't
it?
justice
brennan
under
this
indictment?
justice
brennan
well,
but
--
i
gather
the
proofs
upon
this
second
trial
largely
was
a
proof
to
the
arson,
weren't'
they?
justice
brennan
so,
didn't
this
conviction
rest
upon
the
government's
assertion
which
this
death
followed
in
the
perpetration
of
an
arson?
justice
brennan
well,
why
should
--
the
government
has
been
allowed
to
prove
an
arson
as
the
basis
upon
which
and
without
which
they
could
not
have
secured
in
the
--
on
the
proofs
they
offered,
a
conviction
of
first
degree
murder
under
this
indictment.
why
should
they
have
been
allowed
to
prove
an
arson
of
which
already
the
defendant
stood
convicted?
justice
brennan
well,
would
that
follow,
suppose
if
he
had
been
acquitted
of
the
--
on
the
arson
count?
justice
brennan
well
in
double
jeopardy
terms,
does
it
matter
whether
the
result
is
acquittal
or
reverse
or
a
conviction?
justice
brennan
now,
what
--
then
that
related
to
res
judicata.
does
it
make
a
bit
of
difference
on
--
on
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata
whether
a
result
is
acquittal
or
a
conviction?
justice
brennan
and
a
lot
later
once
in
1833
in
new
jersey.
justice
brennan
well
now
--
now
that
doesn't
answer
the
question
i
asked
in
res
judicata
terms,
does
it
make
any
difference
--
justice
brennan
--
whether
the
result
has
been
an
acquittal
or
conviction?
justice
brennan
well
--
justice
brennan
well
again,
i
asked
you
in
res
judicata
terms,
what
difference
does
it
make
if
the
result
of
the
first
trial
was
a
--
an
acquittal
rather
than
a
conviction
--
justice
brennan
--
in
either
event,
does
in
res
judicata?
justice
brennan
well
then,
why
--
why
isn't
that
the
answer
to
this
case
then?
justice
brennan
that
is
my
point.
that
issue
has
been
determined.
justice
brennan
well,
what's
the
different
element?
the
only
different
element
is
that
death
followed
from
this
arson,
didn't
it?
justice
brennan
that's
different
from
that.
justice
brennan
now,
mr.
sand,
what
you've
been
telling
me
when
you
say
under
the
federal
law,
do
you
mean
under
the
under
the
federal
law
or
under
district
law?
justice
brennan
well
--
justice
brennan
generally,
entirely
apart
from
any
(inaudible)
of
district
statutes
of
our
--
justice
brennan
mr.
sand,
you
say
it
was
not
in
custody?
justice
brennan
well,
i'm
reading
page
49.
justice
brennan
when
you
got
there.
tell
us
about
the
room
that
is,
a
dozen
or
may
be
14
beds
in
it.
it's
a
large
room.
it
has
bars
across
it
--
across
it.
it
is
locked.
justice
brennan
the
officer,
to
get
the
key
and
lock
the
door
and
allow
him
to
go
in.
justice
brennan
was
he
told
he
had
the
right
to
get
one?
