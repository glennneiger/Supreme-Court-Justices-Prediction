mr.
stanley
denlinger
mr.
chief
justice
and
associates
of
this
honorable
court.
the
respondent
in
this
case,
a
small
butcher
and
at
one
of
the
crossroads
of
ohio
never
expected
to
reach
the
stage
of
judicial
questioning
when
we
started
an
action
in
summit
county,
ohio
too
and
joined
stranger
pickets.
and
i
use
that
word
because
it
becomes
important
in
the
discussion
of
the
trespass
angle
of
the
case.
the
respondent
in
this
case
operated
a
three
retail
stores
not
doing
any
butchering
but
bringing
in
the
products
for
sale
over
the
counter
and
no
sales
beyond
the
immediate
county
of
summit.
upon
the
filing
of
this
petition,
a
temporary
injunction
was
requested
by
motion
and
notice
and
hearing
and
at
that
time,
a
temporary
was
entered
with
reference
to
two
of
the
stores
and
immediately.
the
petitioner
here
removed
the
case
to
the
federal
court
in
cleveland,
ohio.
there
on
motion
to
remand
judge
mcnamee
found
that
the
petition
contained
no
allegations
of
a
federal
question
or
allegations
from
which
a
federal
question
might
be
inferred
is
the
same
court
that
just
a
few
weeks
prior
to
that
had
refused
an
injunction
against
the
common
pleas
court
of
cuyahoga
county
proceeding
in
the
richman
brothers
case
which
eventually
reached
this
court
on
his
right
or
authority
to
enjoin
or
not.
when
he
got
back
into
the
state
court,
the
issue
was
made
by
answer
and
reply
under
the
fact
of
some
of
our
procedure
in
ohio
revived
varied
question
of
affecting
commerce
became
an
issue
and
there
was
a
lack
of
evidence
and
testimony
received
on
that
very
issue
and
the
trial
court
found
on
the
evidence
that
commerce
was
not
effective.
the
trial
court
brought
into
play
at
that
time
also
the
declaration
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
setting
forth
its
yardstick
and
found
that
the
figures
which
were
presented
did
not
fall
outside
of
the
yardstick.
now
this
case
then
went
to
our
court
of
appeals
not
on
questions
of
law
but
it
was
tried
anew,
de
novo.
and
there
both
sides
offered
and
have
the
opportunity
to
offer
further
testimony
if
necessary
or
desirable.
and
there
our
court
of
appeals
of
three
judges,
unanimously
found
that
commerce
was
not
affected
and
that
this
union
and
its
stranger
and
its
business
agents
strangers
to
the
play
were
not
entitled
to
trespass
supply,
the
land
of
the
plaintiff
to
carry
on
their
organizational
effort
to
insist
and
compel
the
employer
to
sign
a
contract
which
contained
the
union
security
clause
and
require
the
membership
in
the
union
as
a
condition
precedent
to
his
employment.
now
the
policy
of
ohio
has
been
as
not
enunciated
by
legislative
act
as
we
have
no
little
wagner
act
in
ohio
and
no
labor
board.
and
in
this
case
gentlemen,
neither
party
appealed
to
the
label
relations
board
either
by
way
of
representation
request
or
by
charging
that
any
unfair
labor
practice
had
been
committed
by
either.
in
that
case,
the
court
of
appeals
revived
as
you
might
say
the
order
of
the
common
pleas
court
holding
that
it
was
against
the
policy
of
the
state
of
ohio
to
picket
to
compel
an
employer
to
sign
an
agreement
embodying
the
union
security
clause
where
the
union
did
not
represent
a
majority
of
the
employees.
that
is
the
policy
of
ohio
which
mr.
ratner
had
said
to
your
court,
your
honors
agrees
with
the
labor
relations
board
and
the
--
their
decisions
in
the
act.
now
when
they
were
dissatisfied
with
the
order
of
our
court
of
appeals,
this
went
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
on
questions
of
conflict
between
certain
court
of
appeals
decisions
on
the
similar
question
and
that
is
what
our
court
meant
in
ohio
when
it
said
there
was
no
constitutional
question
presented
to
it
in
the
supreme
court
because
their
claim
was
a
conflict
between
two
judicial
determinations
within
the
state
and
on
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
and
our
practice
in
ohio
is
that
our
supreme
court
may
or
may
decline
to
consider
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
on
the
rehearing
motion,
they
urged
that
the
decision
in
the
fairlawn
case
was
contrary
to
the
grimes
and
howard
decision
which
had
previously
been
upheld
--
upheld
the
union's
contention
in
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
based
on
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
garner
case.
and
so,
it
is
on
that
basis
that
we
get
into
this
court.
and
here,
we
want
to
urge
upon
your
honors,
what
we
feel
is
a
justification
for
the
decisions
of
our
state
courts.
we
think
that
affecting
commerce
is
not
a
mere
obstruction.
we
think
as
judge
harlan
said
in
this
railroad
case
last
month
in
the
united
states,
the
tariff
is
not
merely
an
obstruction.
that
affecting
commerce
as
a
question
of
fact
which
a
state
court
has
a
perfect
right
to
hear
the
evidence
upon
and
that
this
court
may
rely
upon
the
fairness
judicial
temperament
and
honesty
of
our
state
courts
to
determine
that
question
under
the
politic
particular
facts
of
the
case
before
it.
and
we
have
stated
to
your
honors
in
our
brief
the
judicial
determination
of
this
court
which
we
feel
justifies
the
right
of
the
courts
of
ohio
to
go
into
that
problem
and
determine
it.
now,
merely
for
the
sake
of
correction
and
not
that
it
really
matters,
mr.
ratner
said
our
imports
were
$300,000
a
year
or
as
the
record
clearly
shows
that
a
$103,000
worth
of
meat
was
shipped
in
from
various
states
on
orders
given
to
the
salesman
in
the
county
of
summit
where
the
account
was
carried
and
the
transaction
completed
except
for
the
transportation
of
the
merchandise
from
iowa
or
whatever
state
it
came.
now,
i
would
not
be
able
to
stop
here
with
clear
conscience
and
fail
to
discuss
with
your
honors
the
second
question
which
is
important.
we
thought
we
were
safe
on
the
first
ground
i
have
stated
to
you,
but
this
court
has
permitted
the
entrance
of
this
case
and
two
others
on
what
we
feel
a
very
tougher
reason
that
this
court
tell
all
of
us,
the
relationship
which
of
the
courts
of
the
various
states
has
with
the
labor
relations
act
and
the
problems
arising
under
labor.
and
i
concede
from
the
later
two
cases
from
california,
the
garmon
and
the
guss
case
which
follows
us
that
your
honors
have
apparently
had
that
in
mind.
and
so
when
we
get
into
that
tag
match
so
to
speak,
we
find
in
the
briefs
filed
in
this
case
in
the
fairlawn
case
on
the
one
team
as
the
afl-cio
and
the
petitioner
of
the
unions.
on
the
other
--
at
the
invitation
of
this
court,
the
solicitor
general
has
filed
a
brief
and
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
conjunction
with
him.
the
ohio
chamber
of
commerce,
the
ohio
retail
merchants
association,
the
national
retail
merchant
associations
in
seven
states
through
their
attorney
generals,
the
states
of
wisconsin,
georgia,
texas,
vermont,
virginia,
wyoming
and
florida
and
by
numbers
we
outlay
them.
we
trust
our
reasoning
outweighs
them
because
all
of
these
boards
and
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
the
solicitor
general
have
stated
unequivocally
and
without
reservation
that
the
courts
of
ohio
had
jurisdiction
and
full
right
to
proceed
here
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
and
the
same
position
is
taken
by
this
gentlemen
from
the
government
and
from
the
state
boards
in
the
cases
where
the
board
--
state
board
is
involved
or
where
there
has
been
an
actual
declination
by
the
proper
officer
of
the
board
to
accept
the
case
which
problem
is
not
in
our
case
because
there
was
no
declination
and
because
we
relied
upon
the
announced
declaration
of
the
board
that
they
will
not
accept
jurisdiction
in
a
case
in
which
are
import
sales
and
no
exports
were
involved.
we
see
no
great
distinction
of
weight
between
the
problem
in
our
case
and
in
the
guss
case
and
in
the
garmon
case.
what
distinctions
there
are,
we
think
are
not
sufficient
weight
for
your
honors
to
spend
any
time
upon.
we
are
all
of
the
same
opinion
that
congress
has
not
swept
the
field
of
labor
as
this
court
has
said
that
there
are
certain
delegated
power
which
lies
dormant
and
unexercised
and
the
board
has
the
right
not
to
exercise.
particularly
where
jurisdiction
has
been
declined
all
of
the
attorney
generals
of
all
of
the
states
that
have
state
boards
have
found
that
section
10
(a)
of
the
labor
management
act
does
not
preclude
them
from
taking
jurisdiction
where
the
yardstick
prevails
as
to
the
facts.
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
from
gibbons
against
ogden
on
down
to
the
present
time
that
conflict
is
the
cheap
consideration
or
at
least
a
very
strong
consideration
to
determine
thus
impasse
which
might
arise
between
the
courts
of
our
state
and
the
boards
and
courts
of
our
federal
government
but
that
equally
traditional
that
labor
is
a
field
and
labor
problems
that
affect
the
community
locally.
and
unless
there
is
a
clear
inference
which
the
courts
may
draw
that
congress
did
intend
clearly
to
preempt
the
field
that
preemption
does
not
apply.
i
don't
know
whether
your
honors
may
want
to
consider
this
question
on
the
basis
of
preemption
or
on
the
question
of
primary
jurisdiction,
a
subject
this
court
just
discussed
last
week,
where
judge
harlan
has
thought
this
primary
jurisdiction
exist
where
there
are
two
places
where
authority
originally
existed
but
a
--
an
agency
has
come
along
with
regulatory
power
and
the
discussion
of
that
case
i
get
some
heartening
out
of
as
to
the
possible
thinking
of
this
court.
when
he
said,
that
not
--
not
in
all
cases
must
we
look
to
a
commission
for
a
definition
of
the
thing
it's
regulating
or
enforcing
but
where
it
has
made
a
pronouncement
such
as
the
labor
board,
i
will
use
for
analogy
here
has
made
in
the
declination
of
jurisdiction.
we
have
the
right
to
rely
upon
that
and
courts
and
not
the
commission,
does
have
the
right
and
the
jurisdiction
to
proceed
to
hear
the
case
relying
upon
that
pronouncement.
i
have
stated
in
my
brief
and
the
briefs
of
both
the
state
and
the
board
and
the
solicitor
general
clearly
established
there
was
no
conflict
between
what
happened
in
ohio
and
what
the
board
would
have
done.
i
prefer
to
take
that
statement
coming
from
a
representative
of
the
boards
than
to
statement
of
counsel
guessing
what
the
board
might
have
done.
gentlemen,
i
felt
of
all
cases
where
oral
argument
properly
was
not
necessary.
this
might
be
one
of
them
in
view
of
the
fine
briefs
that
have
been
written
by
many
eminent
counsel
in
this
case
and
i
--
as
i
have
read
my
own
again,
i
have
been
odd
by
the
artistry
of
those
for
the
government,
the
state
boards.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
yes,
your
honor,
i
should
go
into
that
because
it
has
been
so
heavily
argued
here.
i
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
all
of
your
decisions
since
this
proviso
became
an
enactment
it
has
never
been
previously
cited
or
considered
or
offered
to
this
court
by
anyone
or
anyone
of
this
court
using
it
as
a
basis
for
preempting
this
field.
now
i
cannot
concede
that
if
section
10
(a)
since
its
existence
these
many
years
would
have
assisted
this
court
in
promptly
disposing
of
many
of
its
labor
cases
coming
from
our
state
courts
involving
various
questions
that
if
it
were
considered
by
the
court
or
counsel
in
the
cases
that
it
was
the
thing
that
prevented
any
state
court
or
board
from
hearing
a
matter
that
someone
before
now
would
have
brought
it
to
this
courts
attention.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
as
i
understand
judge
black,
there
has
been
no
cession
agreements
during
this
period
that
is
my
information.
and
i
would
like
for
your
honors
to
recognize
this
a
little
aside
from
section
10
(a)
that
the
brief
of
the
new
york
board
will
establish
to
you
by
statistics
that
90%
of
the
field
and
labor
will
go
wholly,
ungoverned,
a
no
man's
land
in
which
the
majority
of
the
people
of
our
nations
will
be
lepers
who
have
no
recourse
to
any
place
for
relief
if
the
position
that
has
been
maintained
by
the
petitioner
herein
should
prevail.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
we
think
judge
warren
that
10
(a)
passed
hurriedly
after
the
bethlehem
case
where
the
court
had
found
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
had
said
foreman
or
not
a
proper
unit
for
bargaining.
and
the
state
of
new
york
came
along
and
considered
that
they
work
and
argued
the
cession
arrangement
with
the
--
to
this
court
and
this
court
found
there
had
been
no
agreement
to
cede
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
was
an
appropriate
unit
to
the
state
board
that
congress
intended
to
leave
the
practice
that
the
board
had
been
indulging
in
from
its
very
beginning
to
decline
certain
cases
that
he
had
meant
merely
to
give
them
the
empowering,
if
you
please,
it
does
not
direct
them
your
honors.
empower
the
labor
relations
board
to
make
agreements
with
those
boards
that
it
desired
to
use
to
assist
them
in
the
caring
of
their
load
of
cases
they
would
otherwise
assume.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
your
honors,
i
think
not.
i
think
we
can
say
here
that
again,
congress
has
left
a
lot
for
you
in
this
court
and
us
lawyers
to
guess
about.
that
is
my
best
guess
is
the
most
i
can
say
for
it
your
honor.
it
has
been
passed
upon
however,
this
very
thing
by
a
circuit
court
and
a
very,
very
honorable
one
which
we
cite
on
page
62
of
our
brief
where
the
ninth
circuit
says,
“by
the
expressed
language
of
section
10
(a),
the
board
was
and
still
is
empowered
not
directed
to
prevent
persons
from
engaging
in
unfair
labor
practices
affecting
congress.
its
discretionary
authority
in
respect
to
its
assertion
of
jurisdiction
was
never
so
far
as
we
are
informed
questioned
under
the
act
as
it
existed
prior
to
1947.
the
board
has
wide
discretion
in
the
issuance
of
complaints.
it
is
not
required
by
the
statute
to
move
on
every
charge,
it
is
merely
unable
to
do
so.
the
board
itself
without
judicial
challenge
acted
on
the
assumption
that
it
could
or
reasons
of
policy
or
for
budgetary
or
other
reasons
decline
to
issue
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
so
forth.”
now
that's
a
decision
since
the
provision
was
enacted
which
we
think
supports
our
position
but
does
not
answer
the
question
of
what
congress
had
in
mind.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
i
--
mr.
stanley
denlinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
there
was
no
violence
your
honor,
it
was
mere
trespass
and
the
--
mr.
stanley
denlinger
there
were
seven
employees
that
engaged
in
picketing
from
time
to
time.
the
main
picketing
was
done
by
the
union
which
is
composed
of
butchers
from
many
adjoining
counties
not
locally
at
all.
so
that's
it
your
honor
and
this
--
this
picketing
was
done
--
mr.
stanley
denlinger
--
on
it's
face
between
the
--
mr.
stanley
denlinger
that
--
against
the
union
and
these
two
business
agents,
that's
against
whom
they
--
it
was.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
well,
there
was
considerable
question
under
the
evidence
on
that
your
honor.
the
union
was
claiming
that
once
a
man
had
signed
up
in
the
butchers
that
he
was
forever
a
member
of
the
union
whereas
some
eight
or
nine
of
these
men
who
testified
in
the
proceeding
stated
they
were
no
longer
members
of
the
union
although
the
union
claimed
them
from
the
fact
that
had
one
time
they
had
joined.
mr.

no,
they
continued
on
the
--
mr.
stanley
denlinger
yes,
for
a
freedom
about
--
for
the
period
about
20
or
30
days
your
honors
between
the
time
that
the
case
was
heard
in
the
federal
court
down
to
the
time
of
remand.
they
picketed
in
direct
violation
of
the
existing
order
of
the
court.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
they
discontinued,
that
is
correct.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
that
is
correct.
there
was
no
picketing
after
or
at
the
time
this
case
was
originally
heard
on
the
merits.
and
there's
no
picketing
going
on
now.

injunction
did
not
require

mr.
stanley
denlinger
well,
that
was
evidenced
that
seven
or
eight

gang
up
at
the
time
your
honor,
but
the
mass
picketing
i
think
as
your
honor
and
i
consider
it
of
many
dozens
probably
at
gates,
there
was
nothing
of
that
nature.
there
was
no
violence.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
yes,
that's
right.
change
of
shift
and
so
on
that
occurred.
if
there's
no
other
questions
your
honor,
i
shall
relieve
the
time
at
this
moment.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
thank
you.
