mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
ohio
which
sustained
the
issuance
of
an
injunction,
permanently
prohibiting
petitioners
peacefully
from
picketing
at
fairlawn's
three
stores.
in
the
operation
of
those
three
stores,
fairlawn
annually
imports
or
causes
to
be
imported
from
states
other
than
the
state
of
ohio
merchandise
--
merchandise
valued
at
approximately
$300,000
each
year.
under
the
familiar
test
annunciated
by
this
court
that
importation
of
that
quantity
of
merchandise
would
be
sufficient
to
establish
that
fairlawn's
operations
are
subject
to
the
national
labor
relations
act.
however,
because
fairlawn
does
not
import
as
much
as
a
million
dollars
worth
of
goods
merchandise
directly
or
$2
million
worth
of
merchandise
annually,
indirectly
from
out
of
the
state,
the
national
labor
relations
board
currently
would
decline
for
budgetary
or
other
reasons
as
the
tenth
circuit
recently
put
it
best
known
to
the
nlrb
to
assert
its
jurisdiction
over
enterprises
which
fall
in
the
category
of
the
fairlawn
meats
incorporated.
the
state
of
ohio
has
no
statute
comparable
to
the
taft-hartley
act.
accordingly,
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
national
labor
relations
board
under
the
proviso
to
section
10
(a)
of
the
taft-hartley
act
to
see
this
jurisdiction
which
at
best
declines
to
assert
to
the
state
of
ohio.
we'll
return
to
section
10
(a)
in
just
a
moment,
after
canvassing
briefly
the
extent
to
which
ohio's
labor
policy
as
it
was
applied
in
this
case,
parallels
and
overlaps
in
the
extent
to
which
it
is
in
conflict,
which
the
policies
that
congress
would
have
taft-hartley
act
determine
should
be
applicable
to
disputes
of
this
kind.
in
one
respect,
ohio
--
ohio's
policy
is
identical
with
the
policy
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
a
strike
or
picket,
which
has
as
it's
object
compelling
an
employer
to
enter
into
a
union
shop
agreement
at
a
time
when
a
labor
organization
represents
only
a
minority
of
the
employer's
employees
is
regarded
by
ohio
is
unlawful.
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
that
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
however,
when
the
national
board
finds
that
that
is
the
purpose
of
a
particular
strike
or
picketing,
although
it
issues
a
cease
and
desist
order,
it
is
very
careful
to
limit
the
scope
of
it's
cease
and
desist
order
so
as
to
leave
the
union
free
while
it
is
a
minority
to
engage
in
peaceful
picketing
for
other
than
that
purpose
namely
specifically,
to
engage
in
peaceful
picketing
for
organizational
purposes
or
to
obtain
recognition.
and
the
reason
it
does
so
is
very
clear.
the
legislative
history
of
the
taft-hartley
act
makes
it
perfectly
blank
that
congress
intended
to
permit
labor
organizations
while
they
are
minorities
to
engage
in
strikes
and
peaceful
picketing
for
organizational
purposes
and
to
obtain
recognition.
accordingly,
even
if
we
assume
in
this
case
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
had
made
the
same
--
would
have
made
had
it
handled
the
case.
the
identical
findings
to
the
purpose
of
the
strike
and
picketing
that
the
courts
below
made
in
this
case.
the
ohio
decree
is
much,
much
broader
than
a
decree
which
the
board
would
have
entered
on
this
finding.
but
because
the
ohio
courts
operating
in
their
common
law
sphere,
function
in
a
framework
of
policy
so
completely
different
from
a
policy
framework
within
which
the
national
labor
relations
board
functions,
it
is
not
at
all
clear
that
this
case
would
have
been
treated
in
at
all
the
same
fashion,
had
the
national
labor
relations
board
considered
it
under
the
rules
which
congress
decided
should
apply
to
enterprises
whose
labor
relations
affect
interstate
commerce.
if
the
national
labor
relations
board
had
entertained
this
case,
it
would
unquestionably
have
found
and
condemned
as
unfair
labor
practices,
the
acts
of
interference
and
coercion
engaged
in
by
fairlawn
meats
for
the
purpose
of
inducing
its
employees
to
repudiate
the
union,
including
the
circulation
by
supervisory
employees
on
company
time
and
property
of
petitions
which
the
employees
were
asked
by
the
supervisor
to
sign
repudiating
the
union.
this
is
a
classic
kind
of
unfair
labor
practice.
and
also,
the
board
would
have
condemned
this
an
unfair
labor
practice
as
constructive
discharges.
fairlawn's
action
inducing
employees
who
had
joined
the
union
to
resign
from
its
employment
on
the
ground
that
union
membership
was
incompatible
with
loyalty
to
an
employment
by
fairlawn
meats.
indeed
if
the
board
had
handled
this
case,
instead
of
an
injunction,
restraining
the
union
from
peaceful
picketing
and
from
strike,
the
board
would
probably
have
issued
an
order
compelling
fairlawn
to
cease
and
desist
from
its
unfair
labor
practices
and
to
have
bargained
collectively
in
good
faith
with
the
union.
ohio
says
however,
that
it
must
be
free
to
apply
its
inconsistent
policies
to
this
dispute,
because
it
--
it
is
not
free
to
do
that.
there
will
be
a
no
man's
land,
in
which
this
economic
conflict
between
these
parties,
the
local
union
of
the
amalgamated
meat
cutters
and
fairlawn
meats
will
go
entirely
unregulated
by
any
governmental
authority.
that
is
the
nub
of
this
case
and
it
is
the
thread
that
ties
this
case
to
the
companion
cases
which
follow.
now
the
congress
which
passed
the
taft-hartley
act
was
familiar
with
this
no
man's
land
problem
which
is
created
when
the
national
labor
relations
board
for
reasons
of
budget
or
other
administrative
considerations
declines
to
assert
its
jurisdiction
over
an
employer
whose
activities
in
the
interstate
commerce
bring
him
within
the
scope
and
coverage
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
--
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
we
raised
no
question,
your
honor,
with
respect
to
the
board's
power
to
decline,
to
assert
jurisdiction
for
budgetary
and
other
legitimate
administrative
reasons
nor
do
we
in
this
case
ourselves
raised
the
question
as
to
whether
the
board's
declination
as
it
affected
this
case
or
any
of
the
three
cases
here
pending
was
in
fact
for
a
budgetary
or
other
legitimate
administrative
reason.
the
labor
board
however
insists
that
all
of
its
recent
declinations
in
which
they
have
tremendously
expanded
the
area
over
which
they
decline
to
assert
jurisdiction
are
predicated
entirely
upon
budgetary
and
other
legitimate
reasons.
it
urges
that
only
if
they
had
expanded
this
field
for
illegitimate
reasons
which
we
take
it
in
this
situation
to
mean
a
desire
to
reallocate
authority
as
between
the
states
and
the
federal
government
would
they
be
powerless
by
virtue
of
the
proviso
of
the
section
10
(a)
to
do
so.
we
think
the
court
need
not
decide
that
question
here,
because
we
think
that
10
(a)
is
the
only
way
that
states
can
acquire
jurisdiction
over
enterprises
subject
to
the
act
for
which
the
board
declines
to
assert
jurisdiction
for
any
reason.
but
we
do
think
as
the
brief
of
the
seven
states
points
out,
as
a
brief
of
the
employer
points
out
on
the
garmin
case
and
it
seems
apparent
on
the
face
of
a
numerous
board
decisions
that
there
is
at
least
considerable
question
as
to
whether
the
board
is
motivated
by
budgetary
or
other
legitimate
considerations
as
distinguished
from
a
desire
to
reallocate
authority
between
the
states
and
the
federal
government
in
this
field
labor
disputes.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
your
honor
in
my
view,
the
only
relevant
question
is
whether
under
the
familiar
jurisdictional
test
that
this
court
laid
down
in
fainblatt
and
(inaudible)
the
interstate
commerce
operations
of
this
employer
affect
the
interstate
commerce
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
if
they
do,
the
act
applies
to
it.
from
that
point
on,
the
board
may
decline
to
assert
jurisdiction
for
budgetary
or
other
reasons
if
it
chooses.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
well,
i
say
that
largely
because
i'm
influenced
by
what
this
court
said
about
it
within
the
building
trades
case.
this
board
applied
in
a
decision
written
by
mr.
justice
burton
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
--
that
the
board
had
power
to
do
it.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
all
i
can
suggest
to
you
mr.
justice
frankfurter
is
that
it
has
been
suggested
by
eminent
counsel
that
mandamus
ought
to
lie.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
let
me
say
that
for
the
purposes
of
my
argument,
i
have
assumed
that
mandamus
would
not
lie.
i
think
that
if
mandamus
would
lie,
we
cannot
possibly
be
heard
by
it.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
we
assume
it
because
the
history
of
the
board's
declinations
of
jurisdiction
for
budgetary
and
other
reasons
have
been
before
--
before
this
court
on
a
number
of
cases.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
well,
your
honor,
you'll
--
you'll
have
to
excuse
me,
because
i
don't
see
the
focus
in
this
case,
of
the
question
as
to
the
board's
power
to
decline
for
budgetary
and
other
reasons
to
assert
its
jurisdiction
to
begin
with,
because
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i
don't
see
the
focus
to
this
issue
which
in
this
case
is
whether
the
state
can
act
in
an
area
to
which
the
national
act
applies.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
well,
your
honor
if
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
if
i
may
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
if
i
may
say
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
if
i
may
say
so,
your
honor,
i
do
no
think
in
my
mind
and
of
course
i'm
not
a
member
of
the
court,
but
in
my
mind,
decision
of
this
case
does
not
turn
and
whether
the
board
has
discretion
to
decline
to
assert
its
conceded
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
if
they
do
have
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
yes,
that
would
matter
to
me
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
that
would
matter
to
me
a
great
deal.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
your
honor,
all
i
can
say
is,
that
it
is
for
that
reason
that
i
turn
to
the
history,
and
to
the
history
of
the
proviso
of
section
10
(a)
because
congress
assumed
when
it
enacted
the
proviso
of
the
section
10
(a)
on
the
basis
of
what
this
court
said
and
reserved
in
the
bethlehem
case,
that
the
labor
board
did
have
power
for
budgetary
or
other
legitimate
reasons,
to
decline,
to
assert
jurisdiction
over
the
so-called
borderline
or
predominantly
local
industries
to
which
congress
knew
and
intendedly
acted
would
apply.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
yes,
it
did
your
honor.
it
said
it
specifically
in
the
report
of
the
senate
committee
that
presented
the
draft
of
section
10
(a)
the
proviso
to
section
10
(a).
but
before
we
get
to
that,
let
me
point
out
that
the
history
is
that
from
the
very
beginning
of
the
days,
when
the
(inaudible)
extent
of
the
boards
jurisdiction
became
plain,
the
board
decided
that
for
budgetary
and
other
administrative
reasons
it
simply
could
not,
as
a
practical
matter
take
every
case
in
every
industry
that
it
had
to
husband
its
resources
and
it
therefore
must
decline
to
assert
jurisdiction
over
some
industries
which
it
regarded
as
principally
local
in
character.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
the
history
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
the
history
shows
that
your
honor's
last
question,
i
decline
to
take
it,
is
just
exactly
what
the
national
labor
relations
board
did
from
1937
to
1947.
they
did
it
on
a
case
to
case
basis,
and
they
did
it
on
industry
wide
basis.
they
refused
flatly
to
take
cases
in
the
construction
industry
no
matter
who
came
to
them
with
the
cases.
and
then
your
honor's
opinion
in
the
bethlehem
case,
you
attached
an
appendix
--
as
an
appendix,
a
memorandum
of
understanding
which
had
been
entered
into
before
that
case
arose
between
the
new
york
state
board
and
the
national
board.
now
the
--
a
footnote
in
that
--
in
that
memorandum
of
understanding
makes
it
perfectly
plain
that
the
national
board
didn't
believe
that
by
entering
into
this
agreement,
it
was
ceding
it's
jurisdiction
over
this
borderline
industries
to
new
york.
but
what
it
does
indicate
very
clearly
is
that
the
national
board
had
set
on
a
united
states
wide
basis
with
respect
to
certain
industries
like
construction
and
any
of
it.
no
matter
who
comes
to
us
with
the
case
in
one
of
those
industries,
we
will
take
it.
the
whole
reason
we
won't
take
it
as
budgetary
and
other
administrative
consideration,
but
we
won't
take
it.
and
the
classic
in
the
light
of
the
nature
of
the
questions
presented
and
argued
on
the
other
side
to
this
case
today,
the
classic
is
the
minute
of
august
16,
1946
which
appears
in
that
appendix.
this
is
the
minute
where
the
national
labor
relations
board
says
to
a
union
that
once
they
filed
an
election
petition
on
behalf
of
employees
of
brokerage
houses,
the
board
concluded
that
it
would
not
at
this
time
entertain
a
petition
filed
on
behalf
of
the
employees
of
(inaudible)
and
company
or
other
such
brokerage
houses,
because
the
budgetary
and
other
administrative
considerations.
the
board
further
concluded
that
in
view
of
this
disposition,
it
had
no
objection
to
having
the
state
labor
relations
board
of
the
state
of
new
york
entertain
such
petitions
filed
under
the
state
act.
now,
the
majority
opinion
on
the
bethlehem
case
as
the
court
will
recall,
reserved
specifically
this
question,
whether
the
states
have
power
to
assert
jurisdiction
in
these
areas
which
the
board
flatly
declined
for
budgetary
or
other
reasons
to
enter
or
to
handle.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
no
question
about
that.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
it
certainly
did.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
that's
right,
but
i
address
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
--
myself
to
it,
your
honor.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
well
your
honor
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
well,
i
think
it's
a
fair
statement
except
to
say
that
the
legislative
history,
the
--
the
heart
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
proviso
to
the
section
10
(a)
lies
in
this
reservation
of
this
court
in
bethlehem.i
do
not
say
this
court
passed
on
it.
the
election
of
the
national
board
to
decline
jurisdiction
in
certain
types
of
cases
for
budgetary
or
other
reasons
presents
a
different
problem
which
we
do
not
now
decide.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
that
problem
was
left
over
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
--
and
that
problem
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
well
your
honor,
let
me
simply
say
that
congress
when
it
amended
10
(a),
undertook
to
write
the
amendment
10
days
after
bethlehem
and
they
attempted
to
answer
the
problem.
i'll
admit
that
it
wasn't
posed
in
your
--
in
the
terms
you
post
it
namely
is
there
no
one
--
where
there
is
no
administrative,
no
judicial
authority
maybe
to
mandamus
the
board.
they
posed
it
from
a
point
of
view
not
of
the
individuals
affected,
from
the
interest,
and
from
the
stand
point
of
effectuating
the
national
policies.
they
said,
“let's
turn
to
an
answer
this
question
on
what
happens
in
the
no
man's
land.”
because
there
was
a
no
man's
land,
lord
knows.
in
many
states
other
than
new
york,
in
the
vast
majority
of
states
there
were
no
laws
comparable
to
the
wagner
act.
when
the
board
declined
to
assert
jurisdiction
there,
there
was
no
state
agency
or
state
law
that
could
step
in
and
congress
was
faced
with
that
specific
problem.
and
they
said,
“what
shall
we
do?
how
shall
we
resolve
this
question
of
state
power
in
this
areas
where
the
board
declines
to
act.”
and
they
undertook
the
results
by
enacting
the
proviso.
now,
the
legislative
history
to
which
your
honor
referred
shows
two
things,
one,
that
the
proviso
to
section
10
(a)
was
drafted
to
cover
the
borderline
industries
in
which
traditionally
as
i've
said
before
declined
to
assert
jurisdiction.
and
two,
that
it
was
directed
specifically
that
the
question
reserved
in
bethlehem
namely
the
question
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
states
to
enter
this
field
where
the
act
apply
because
the
business
affected
interstate
commerce
but
over
which
the
board
declined
for
whatever
reasons,
budgetary
or
anything
else
to
assert
jurisdiction.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
it
does.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
that
is
our
position.
and
i
shall
now
like
to
turn
to
the
proviso
and
read
it.
provided
that
the
board
is
empowered
by
agreements
with
any
agents
of
any
state
or
territory
to
cede
to
such
agency,
jurisdiction
over
any
cases
in
any
industry,
other
than
mining,
manufacturing,
communications
and
transportation
except
where
predominantly
local
in
character,
even
though
such
cases
may
involve
labor
disputes
affecting
commerce,
unless
the
provision
of
a
state
or
territorial
statute,
applicable
to
the
determination
of
such
cases
by
such
agency
is
inconsistent
with
the
corresponding
provision
of
this
act
or
has
received
a
construction
inconsistent
therewith.
now,
the
argument
that
is
presented
on
the
other
side
of
this
case
that
distinguishes
that
the
legislative
history
of
10
(a)
shows
some
that
the
proviso
does
not
refer
to
the
areas
of
industry
over
which
the
board
traditionally
declined
to
assert
jurisdiction,
but
did
it
applies
only
to
those
areas
of
industry
over
which
the
board
prior
to
bethlehem
consistently
assertive
jurisdiction.
now,
i
can't
square
that
kind
of
a
distinction
with
the
language
of
a
proviso
on
its
face,
over
any
cases
in
any
industry
with
the
exception
of
the
predominantly
national
ones
even
though
such
cases
may
involve
labor
disputes
affecting
commerce.
i
can
square
it
still
less
with
the
legislative
history,
the
actual
history
of
the
amendment,
of
the
proviso
and
of
the
bethlehem
case
which
show
that
prior
to
bethlehem
the
board
declined
for
budgetary
or
other
reasons
and
that
it
was
the
status
of
state
jurisdiction
in
the
areas
over
which
the
board
declined
that
congress
passed
the
proviso
to
section
10
(a)
declarable.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
these
categories
of
cases
are
cases
which
the
congress
told
the
labor
board,
“you
cannot
transfer
to
the
states
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
--
no
matter
how
con
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
--
consistent
(inaudible)
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
the
reason
for
that
restriction
was
that
congress
believe
that
in
the
national
interest,
only
a
national
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
--
board
should
handle
those
cases.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
your
honor,
all
i
can
say
is
that
i'm
speculating
if
i
give
you
an
answer
to
the
question,
it's
probably
historical.
the
board
always
handled
cases
in
those
industries
prior
to
that
time
and
that's
about
it.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
this
is
probably
so.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i
--
i
think
you're
right,
your
honor.
i
can't
give
you
a
more
definite
answer
because
i
can't
be
absolutely
positive
if
that
is
true,
i
think
that's
true.
now,
this
court
has
set
and
it
has
said
so
in
connection
with
cases
which
have
canvassed
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute,
that
the
purpose
of
the
newly
enacted
proviso
to
section
10
(a)
was
“to
meet
situations
made
possible
by
bethlehem
where
no
state
would
be
free
to
take
jurisdiction
over
cases
of
what
kind
over
which
the
board
had
declined
jurisdiction.”
to
leave
out
any
category
of
cases
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
any
category
at
all
from
the
exclusive
sweep
of
that
proviso
is
to
frustrate
the
reason
that
congress
put
the
consistency
limitation
is,
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
amalgamated
association
case
that
the
purpose
of
that
proviso
was
to
ensure
that
the
national
labor
relations
policy
will
not
be
thwarted
even
in
the
predominantly
local
enterprises
to
which
the
proviso
applies.
there
is
i
think
a
touch
of
items
in
the
attempt
of
the
respondents
in
these
cases
and
of
the
state
board
say
nothing
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
itself,
to
manufacture
in
ambiguity
with
respect
to
the
purpose
in
history
of
this
proviso
at
this
time,
because
this
court
has
itself
referred
to
the
section
10
(a)
proviso,
as
the
classic
example
of
clarity,
in
trend,
in
congressional
supersedure
of
state
power.
in
california
versus
zook
this
court
said,
when
stated
enforcement
mechanisms,
so
helpful
to
federal
officials
are
to
be
excluded,
congress
may
say
so,
as
in
the
taft-hartley
act
section
10
(a).
the
entire
argument
that
the
state
should
be
permitted
to
come
in
within
consistent
laws
despite
the
proviso
rest
on
a
balance
and
the
fallacy
is
this
that
to
keep
them
out
is
to
impute
the
congress
would
pass
10
(a)
an
intention
to
create
a
no
man's
land,
but
the
premises
is
false.
congress
created
no
“no
man's
land.”
it
invited
the
states
to
step
in
and
to
take
over
in
these
areas
which
the
board
declined
for
budgetary
or
other
reasons
to
handle
it.
it
invited
them
to
pass
consistent
statutes
so
that
the
board
could
see
jurisdiction
to
them
that's
the
reason
congress
passed
the
proviso.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
and
congress
envisioned
it
and
took
care
to
see
that
that
question
would
be
much
narrower
than
otherwise,
because
the
way
the
proviso
was
drafted,
it
requires
the
board
to
determine
before
ceding
that
the
state's
statute
is
consistent
and
that
it
does
not
receive
the
construction
inconsistent.
certainly
there
is
a
judicial
question
even
remaining
after
that
but
it's
a
far
narrower
one,
than
the
one
that
would
be
in
present
in
thousands
of
cases,
before
this
court
ab
initio
without
a
prior
administrative
determination,
if
this
court
let
the
states
in
free
to
act,
regardless
of
the
failure
of
the
board
to
determine
if
there
was
consistency
on
the
first
instance.
congress
has
known
for
10
years
that
the
effect
of
a
proviso
is
to
exclude
the
states
from
acting
in
this
borderline
field.
the
most
authoritative
report
we
have
on
the
taft-hartley
act,
the
report
of
the
joint
committee
to
the
second
session
of
the
88th
congress
which
we
reprint
in
full
at
pages
80
to
81
of
our
brief,
says
in
so
many
words
we
understand
that
session
of
a
proviso
will
not
be
possible
unless
the
states
undertake
the
passed
laws
consistent
with
the
taft-hartley
act.
we
understand
that,
we
know
it
and
we
also
know
it
that
no
state
has
yet
done
it.
and
then
they
say,
the
desirability
of
letting
the
states
into
this
field
is
obvious,
but
it
can
only
be
done
by
an
amendment
to
the
act
which
would
permit
inconsistent
regulations
in
this
many
different
policies
as
there
are
states
having
labor
relations
acts,
the
desirability
appears
questioned.
it
has
appeared
questionable
to
every
subsequent
congress
which
has
also
read
the
provisions
of
10
(a)
as
i
have
indicated
as
the
exclusive
map
by
which
the
states
can
obtain
authority
to
apply
their
labor
relations'
policies
in
the
areas
to
which
the
act
applies
but
over
which
the
board
has
declined
to
assert
jurisdiction.
