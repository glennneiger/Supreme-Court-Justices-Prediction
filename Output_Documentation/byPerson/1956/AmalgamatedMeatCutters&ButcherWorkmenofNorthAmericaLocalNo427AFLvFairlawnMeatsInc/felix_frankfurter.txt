isn't
that
one
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
an
--
that
was
the
same
thing
(inaudible)
that,
what
i
want
to
know
is
if
an
agency
has
jurisdiction
conferred
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
as
to
include
the
national
labor
relations
board.
what
is
the
answer
to
a
mandamus
proceeding
to
make
it
exercisable?
that
is
what
was
done
in
the
case,
if
the
icc
can't
say
we
don't
want
to
enforce
this,
can
we?
but
this
court
had
issued
mandamus,
now
this
board
had
said
that
mandamus
would
lie.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
know
from
you
whether
i
should
dismiss
that
for
my
mind,
if
i
conclude
that
mandamus
would
lie
may
have
one
answer,
if
i
conclude
that
mandamus
does
not
lie,
i
may
have
another
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
assume
it?
that's
my
next
question.
i
don't
see
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
never
faced
this
question,
so
you're
a
good
enough
lawyer
to
know
what
may
have
been
said
in
passing,
start
with
the
german
issue
when
it's
actually
in
front
of
us.
that's
the
whole
nature
of
--
of
--
arm
hold
of
deciding
cases,
we're
not
bound
by
a
parenthetical
remark
when
nobody's
mind
would
focus
on
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
been
at
the
time,
and
we
haven't
disposed
of
it
but
for
me,
it's
very
important,
if
i
conclude
that
the
board
can
be
mandamus
in
these
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

member
of
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
much
for
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
doesn't
have
to
do
--
doesn't
it
in
your
mind
have
to
do
whether
i
conclude
that
implied
legally,
the
board
may
carve
out
as
though
congress
in
terms
have
set
too,
does
not
mean
--
matter
to
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
raises
the
question
whether
that
is
implied
if
you
jump
a
new
hurdle
in
the
fashion
of
no
man's
land
stability.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
the
same
thing
apart
from
final
report?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'd
like
make
a
distinct
--
i'd
like
to
make
a
discrimination
with
your
consideration.
it's
one
thing
for
an
agent
of
any
law
enforcing
agency
whether
a
court
or
a
board
u.s.attorney
as
a
practical
matter
of
administration,
the
company's
resources
of
the
private
and
then
government
resources,
that
every
case
with
that
discretion
of
an
independent
jurisdiction
and
practically
not
to
administer
the
full
scope
of
its
power.
i
understand
that
very
well.
that's
not
the
answer
to
the
question
whether
if
somebody
says
you
take
my
pay,
it
didn't
say
i
decline
to
take
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
i
don't
want
to
take
any
more
of
your
time,
i
just
want
you
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
reason
i
put
my
questions
to
you
is
because
the
bethlehem
case,
in
the
first
break
for
the
case
in
which
the
court
found
that
in
fact
there
had
been
a
ruling
by
the
board,
by
the
national
board
which
would
have
been
subverted,
by
which
would
have
become
inconsistent
with
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
state
(inaudible)
so
you
have
a
square
this
on
the
record
as
the
court's
finding
that
that
was
applied
to
it,
that
there
was
a
determination,
not
a
declination
but
a
determination
by
way
of
declination
by
the
national
board.
the
court
let
go
(inaudible)
the
first
time
i
think
was
in
1946
as
you
point
out,
before
the
present
change
of
personnel
and
outlook
in
one
in
which
they
called
the
republican
point
of
view
into
the
question
to
and
the
discussion
of
this
case,
except
on
some
aspects
because
this
matter
of
declination
antedated
the
training
of
personnel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
board
of
this
court
explicitly
left
open
the
question
to
which
you
now
addresses
with
the
other
counsel
in
the
case,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
what
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
put
to
mind,
it
becomes
extremely
important
to
get
what
authoritative
ruling
be
--
or
authoritative
likely
said
from
the
legislative
history
that
10
(a)
isn't
the
exclusive
determinant
of
the
problem
of
what
the
law
and
what
is
left
to
the
states
all
though
it
could
belong
to
the
national
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
a
fair
statement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
meant
to
say
it
was
foreclosed
or
that
my
mind
is
closed
because
it
is
--
to
me
a
very
difficult,
complicated
and
far
reaching
problem.
i
do
mean
to
direct
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
when
that
question
you
have
left
open
was
10a
existent,
it
certainly
was
left
open
to
the
discretion
and
that's
why
we're
here
today
whether
or
not
if
there
is
no
mandatory
power
capable
of
compelling
the
board
to
take
impliedly,
that
doesn't
mean
a
delegate
to
where
the
board
explicitly
declined
to
take
it
and
they
had
to
know
conflicts
between
state
and
federal
authority
in
this
specific
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
your
position
(inaudible)
your
position
that
the
proviso
of
10
(a)
exhaustedly
and
comprehensively
and
exclusively
covers
that
which
maybe
left
for
the
state
courts
to
the
state
agency.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
ratner,
would
you
be
--
tell
me
what
the
explanation
of
the
exception
in
the
paragraph
about
mining,
manufacturing,
those
categories,
what
were
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
know
why
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
know
the
reason
for
that
restriction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was
going
to
--
but
why
--
of
course
that
would've
been
--
but
why
were
those
--
why
are
those
--
why
do
those
industries,
those
businesses
have
that
--
had
that
--
why
did
congress
speak
that
about
those
particular
industry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
wondering
whether
congress
put
into
the
limitation
that
which
in
the
history
of
the
court
had
special
consideration
in
its
enforcement
and
as
to
which
you
had
it
declined.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
it
seems
to
me
(inaudible)
light
on
the
scope
of
the
10
(a).
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
still
leave
--
it
would
still
leave
a
judicial
question
as
to
whether
state
laws
are
or
are
not
in
conflict,
wouldn't
it?
