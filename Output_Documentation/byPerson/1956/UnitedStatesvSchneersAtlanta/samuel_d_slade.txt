mr.
samuel
d.
slade
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
here
on
certiorari
to
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
presents
a
question
with
regard
to
the
continuing
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
emergency
court
of
appeals
over
questions
involving
the
validity
of
price
control
regulations.
as
the
court
knows,
the
price
control
program
during
the
korean
war
trade
was
contained
entitled
for
of
the
defense
production
act
of
1950,
which
terminated
on
april
30,
1953.
now,
prior
to
that
termination,
whether
there
was
an
enforcement
proceeding
brought
civil
or
criminal,
the
emergency
court
of
appeals
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
any
question
which
might
arise
as
to
the
validity
of
the
price
regulation
involved.
the
question
here
is
this,
whether
the
termination
on
april
30,
1953
of
the
period
of
active
control
served
to
destroy
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
emergency
court
of
appeals
over
validity
questions
and
simultaneously
give
rise
to
a
district
court
jurisdiction
over
these
questions.
the
--
that
is
the
district
court
in
which
the
enforcement
proceedings
were
pending
of
the
facts
in
this
case
are
very
sparse.
the
united
states
filed
a
civil
enforcement
suit
against
schneers
atlanta
on
february
19,
1953.
in
march,
an
answer
was
filed
which
raised
an
issue
as
to
the
validity
of
the
price
regulation
involved.
in
february
1954,
schneers
moved
the
summary
judgment
substantive
issue
having
them
framed
by
affidavits
and
in
all
argument
on
that
motion
contended
that
the
termination
of
title
4
of
the
1950
act
on
april
30th,
1953
had
brought
the
exclusive
jurisdiction,
the
emergency
court
to
an
end
and
that
thereafter
the
district
court,
in
the
enforcement
case
could
pass
on
the
question
of
validity.
the
district
judge
rejected
this
contention
by
an
order
of
opinion
on
september
14,
1954
which
is
at
page
25
of
the
record,
and
he
held
that
the
emergency
court
of
appeals
continued
to
exercise
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
questions
of
validity,
which
might
arise
during
the
course
of
these
enforcement
proceedings.
subsequently,
a
judgment
was
added
for
the
united
states
and
then
agreed
of
not
with
the
reservation
of
it
and
i
quote,
"any
right"
that
schneers
might
have
to
seek
administrative
review,
review
in
the
emergency
court
of
appeals
or
to
take
an
appeal
to
the
court
below.
schneers
in
fact
sought
to
have
the
emergency
court
of
appeals
pass
on
the
question
of
validity
which
had
been
raised,
but
the
complaint
was
dismissed
of
one
of
jurisdiction.
it
was
filed
out
of
time
by
a
very
short
margin,
but
that
court
is
under
a
statutory
30-day
limitation.
in
other
words,
the
complaint
ancillary
to
a
district
court
enforcement
proceeding
must
be
filed
in
the
emergency
court
of
appeals
within
30
days
of
the
time
permission
to
grant
--
to
file
a
complaint
if
granted.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
the
emergency
court
of
appeals?
it
exists,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
and
we
have
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
no,
we
have
litigation
pending
which
may
call
upon
it
to
act,
part
of
the
jury.
i
think
at
the
present
time
as
shown
by
the
last
report,
they
only
have
one
case
pending
that
has
been
less
activity
in
that
court
in
the
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
well,
it
takes
a
long
time
to
liquidate
the
enforcement
program.
it
took
well
on
into
the
1950s
to
--
to
carry
out
the
1942
program
in
the
enforcement
phase.
we
still
have
some
of
those
cases.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
this
--
we
contend
that
all
questions
as
to
which
exclusive
jurisdiction
was
vested
in
the
emergency
court
by
congress
remain
there.
during
the
post-control
enforcement
period,
there's
always
a
timeline
of
course
between
the
act
of
period
to
control
and
the
mopping
up
of
the
enforcement
litigation.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
no.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
if
the
decision
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
well,
only
to
the
extent
that
complaints
are
filed
with
an
ancillary
depending
enforcement
suits
and
that
can't
be
done
of
course.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
most
--
we
have
enforcement
proceedings
pending
in
court,
for
example
all
the
slaughtering
cases.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
if
after
judgment
in
those
cases,
the
defendant
after
an
adverse
decision
across
that
court
for
permission
to
file
a
complaint
in
the
emergency
court
on
the
validity
question,
that
complaint
can
now
be
filed.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
yes,
and
--
as
i
was
showing,
it's
for
this
reason
that
we
contend
that
the
emergency
court
continues
to
have
the
exclusive
jurisdiction.
as
i
say,
the
effort
here
to
go
to
the
emergency
court
was
unfortunately
out
of
time,
the
time
of
statutory.
so
therefore,
the
appeal
to
the
court
below
was
taken
in
a
single
point
on
appeal
in
the
record
28
was
whether
the
district
court
now
had
jurisdiction
to
pass
on
the
validity
question.
now,
the
opinion
below
agreed
with
this
contention
of
course,
conceded
that
prior
to
the
termination
of
the
act
of
control
program,
exclusive
jurisdiction
was
in
the
emergency
court
and
put
as
the
decisive
question
whether
the
general
saving
statute
which
i
will
refer
to
in
a
moment
continued
those
portions
of
title
4
creating
the
emergency
court
giving
an
exclusive
jurisdiction
so
as
to
continue
that
exclusive
jurisdiction
after
the
termination
of
title
4.
and
it
held
that
the
general
savings
statute
did
not
so
suffice
and
the
way
that
it
arrived
to
this
result
was
this.
it
applied
decisions
of
this
court
such
as
the
bruner
case
and
the
hallowell
case
which
dealt
with
the
situation
where
congress
affirmatively
sought
to
destroy
or
reduce
a
tribunal
jurisdiction.
in
those
cases,
this
court
had
held
the
general
savings
statute
had
no
applicability.
the
court
below
did
not
hold
apposite
here
decisions
of
this
court
such
as
the
de
la
rama
case
in
which
after
a
combined
substantive
and
procedural
program
such
as
the
price
control
program,
program
terminates.
it
is
a
clear
intention
of
congress
to
keep
alive
accrued
violations,
accrued
rights
and
merely
cut
off
future
rights
and
violations.
in
such
cases,
this
court
has
held
that
whatever
remedy,
congress
has
found
particularly
appropriate
to
the
passed
rights,
violations
continues
under
the
general
savings
statute.
now,
we
think
that
it's
the
de
la
rama
type
of
situation
that
we
have
here
and
that
case
should've
controlled.
we
think
we
have
here
as
the
court
knows,
the
whole
complex
scheme
of
price
control
contained
in
title
4,
the
1950
act,
in
which
congress
has
selected
as
a
central
feature
of
that
whole
scheme,
but
the
fact
that
one
tribunal
and
one
tribunal
only
shall
pass
on
questions
of
validity
of
price
regulations.
that
is
the
emergency
court
of
appeals.
the
section,
section
408
(c)
is
contained
in
our
brief
in
section
--
at
page
8,
and
it
reenacts
a
statutory
plan
that
full
of
title
4
does,
statutory
plan
that
was
developed
and
refined
throughout
the
world
war
ii
period
in
which
it
was
consciously
reenacted
in
1950
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
korean
period
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
grand
central
case
in
unanimous
decision
that
congress
very
deliberately
considered
and
readopted
the
1942
scheme
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
1950
period.
now,
as
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
yes.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
that
would
be
the
consequence
of
the
decision
below.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
yes.
that's
its
consequence
of
the
decision
below.
and
--
and
if
i
may
take
that,
what
seems
to
be
the
core
of
this
case
right
now,
we
think
it's
crystal
clear
from
the
outset
of
this
legislation
in
1940
and
1941
running
right
on
through
the
1950
korean
war
period.
that
congress
has
adopted
the
emergency
court
exclusive
jurisdiction
system
for
a
consistent
set
of
reasons
and
has
consistently
rejected
every
attempt
to
vest
contract
jurisdiction
over
validity
questions
in
the
various
district
and
state
courts.
and
the
reason
is
signed
and
we've
set
them
up
on
our
brief
later
on
at
--
at
length.
they're
always
the
same.
they
wanted
uniformity
of
decision,
avoiding
multiplicity
of
decision
on
all
these
complex
questions
that
might
arise.
they
wanted
these
decisions
made
by
a
deeply
skilled
tribunal.
that
certainly
is
the
emergency
court
of
appeals
in
these
matters,
which
could
give
skilled
and
expeditious
handling
to
the
problems
as
they
came
up.
congress
has
again
and
again
said,
"we
do
not
wish
to
throw
to
the
many
courts
the
kind
of
questions
that
comes
up
in
validity
cases
or
we
will
have
a
multiplicity
of
decision.
we
can
do
nothing
but
result
in
confusion."
and
this
court
has
in
fact
in
the
yates
case
recognized
this
as
a
primary
purpose
of
the
emergency
court.
now,
as
the
court
below
suggested,
there
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
no.
what
happened
was
that
even
the
emergency
court
of
appeals,
at
the
outset
of
this
1950
program
and
the
1942
program
was
denied
the
power
of
interlocutory
injunction.
in
this
1950
program
and
1952,
that
restriction
was
relaxed
and
the
emergency
court
of
appeals
was
given
the
power
of
interlocutory
injunction
which
is
some
indication
that
when
the
immediate
keep
was
over
and
the
program
matured
and
gone
under
way,
urgency
was
not
all.
uniformity
of
decision
by
a
skilled
tribunal
became
a
primary
consideration.
and
even
in
giving
that
tribunal
the
power
to
interlock
--
to
issue
interlocutory
injunctions,
the
congress
reaffirmed
that
the
central
purpose
of
the
emergency
court
of
appeals
in
the
whole
price
control
scheme
was
to
avoid
confusion
and
multiplicity
of
decision
in
both
initial
administration
of
the
program
and
in
the
fairness
and
uniformity
of
enforcement
under
it.
now,
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief,
pages
24,
25,
35
and
in
appendix
c
starting
on
page
47,
a
host
of
references
and
including
the
numerous
occasions
on
which
efforts
were
made,
very
contentious
and
carefully
considered
criticisms
were
made
to
this
exclusive
jurisdiction
feature.
and
again
and
again,
it
was
dissent
to
the
majority
of
both
houses
of
congress
that
this
aspect
of
title
4
and
its
predecessor
legislation
was
crucial
to
the
functioning
of
the
price
control
program.
as
with
this
background,
then
that
we
come
to
the
two
saving
statues
which
--
either
of
which
with
a
sufficed
and
do
sufficed
in
this
case
to
preserve
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
emergency
court
of
appeals.
in
19
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
the
--
it
came
to
an
end
on
april
30,
1953.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
oh,
that
title
4
of
the
defense
production
act
is
the
title
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
oh,
no.
it
just
suspended.
title
4
was
just
suspended
on
an
earlier
day
for
executive
order
and
by
its
--
by
its
own
terms.
it
terminated
on
april
30,
1953.
now,
there
was
no
suggestion
that
anything
was
specifically
terminated.
that's
not
shown
in
the
moment.
this
court
has
held
in
allen
against
grand
central
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
1950
legislation
either
expressly
or
by
implication
which
is
in
any
way
inconsistent
with
the
policy
of
the
general
savings
statute.
we
think
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that's
controlling.
but
first,
i
should
like
to
turn
to
the
specific
savings
provision
of
the
1950
legislation
itself
which
is
section
706
(b)
and
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
page
11
and
12,
and
i
don't
think
i
haven't
talked
about
this.
now,
that
section
says
that
the
termination
of
the
authority
under
the
statute
shall
not
operate
to
defeat
any
suit,
action
or
prosecution
whether
that
therefore
or
thereafter
permits
with
respect
to
any
right,
liability
or
offense
committed
prior
to
the
termination
date.
and
we
argued
technically
on
our
brief
that
on
this
language
alone,
the
decision
below
is
wrong.
to
hold
that
a
new
jurisdiction
arises
over
validity
questions
in
the
district
court
which
had
not
existed
there,
the
foreword
in
the
language
of
the
savings
provision
permit
the
defeat
of
the
enforcement
case
in
a
manner
not
clear
or
possible
during
the
interlocutory
program.
again,
the
decision
below
creating
jurisdiction
over
invalidity
questions
in
the
district
court
would
completely
defeat
the
ancillary
suit
in
the
emergency
court
of
appeals
which
has
also
been
held
by
the
emergency
court
of
appeals
itself
to
be
a
suit
with
--
with
respect
to
a
liability
incurred
under
the
act
by
its
termination.
and
on
this
basis
and
others,
the
first
ninth
--
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
as
well
as
the
emergency
court
of
appeals
itself
has
held
that
section
706
(b)
suffices
to
continue
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
emergency
court
of
appeals
in
connection
with
enforcement
proceedings
after
april
30,
1953.
now,
there
was
as
i
said
this
court
has
noted
and
it
is
well
recognized
that
the
whole
1950
program
was
based,
consciously
based
on
the
1942
legislation
in
the
administration
of
that
whole
enormous
program.
the
1942
act
contained
a
special
savings
provision,
and
this
court
held
in
woods
against
hill
that
the
termination
of
the
1942
price
control
act
did
not
divest,
the
--
the
emergency
court
of
appeals
of
its
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
validity
questions
in
connection
with
pending
enforcement
suits
after
the
termination
of
the
act
of
control
period.
now,
there
are
minor
differences
and
we
think
they
are
minor
in
language
between
the
savings
provision
706
(b)
set
forth
in
the
brief
here
in
the
1950
act,
and
the
savings
language
of
the
1942
act
which
is
set
forth
on
page
21
of
our
brief.
but
even
if
some
significance
would've
been
attached
to
the
difference
in
terminology,
it's
--
it's
really
quite
unimportant
here
because
this
court
has
already
held
that
there
is
nothing
including
section
706
(b)
in
the
1950
act,
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
general
saving
statute
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
page
28.
now,
this
court
then
has
held
that
the
general
savings
statute
applies.
that
statute
says
on
its
face
that
the
exploration
of
a
temporary
statute
such
as
this
shall
not
have
the
effect
to
release
or
extinguish
any
penalty,
liability
or
forfeiture
incurred
under
such
statute
unless
the
temporary
statute
shall
so
expressly
provide
and
that
said
statute
shall
be
treated
as
remaining
in
full
force
in
effect
for
the
purpose
of
sustaining
the
subsequent,
the
post-controlling
enforcement
action
or
suit.
as
i
say,
this
court
held
in
allen
against
grand
central
that
whatever
significance
be
attached
to
the
specific
savings
language
of
the
1950
act,
it
was
not
any
indication
by
congress
either
expressed
or
implied
that
the
general
savings
statute
did
not
apply.
and
if
the
general
saving
statute
does
apply,
then
the
statute
is
preserved,
namely,
title
4
for
the
purpose
of
reaching
accrued
violations.
and
if
title
4
is
preserved,
then
the
whole
emergency
court
set
up
is
necessarily
preserved
for
the
purposes
of
sustaining
that
suit.
and
that
is
precisely
what
this
court
held
in
woods
against
hill
under
the
savings
provision
of
the
1942
legislation
which
is
identical
with
this
general
saving
statute.
finally,
and
i
think
these
two
was
held
in
grand
central,
but
if
there
were
no
grand
central
case,
we
think
that
the
decision
of
this
court,
unanimous
decision
of
this
court
in
the
de
la
rama
case
would
control.
we
quote
it
quite
copiously
from
that
case
at
pages
30
and
31
of
our
brief
and
it
makes
this
point
which
i
suggested
at
the
outset.
this
is
no
mere
jurisdictional
statute.
this
statute
in
the
opinion
of
congress
is
an
integral
part
of
the
whole
price
control
program
where
mere
jurisdictional
statutes
were
involved
and
congress
wishes
to
deprive
or
destroy
the
jurisdiction
part
of
the
tribunal
of
it,
it
does
so
affirmative.
no
rights
are
involved.
no
rights
are
involved
to
be
preserved
and
the
general
saving
statute
has
no
application
in
such
a
situation,
but
that
is
not
this
case
as
de
la
rama
case
points
out.
this
is
the
situation
where
the
right
or
liability
to
be
preserved
and
reached
in
an
enforcement
proceeding
is
inextricably
tied
up
with
this
remedy
which
congress
has
selected
as
particularly
appropriate
and
that
to
save
the
right
which
must
be
done
concededly,
court
below
so
conceded
without
preserving
the
particular
remedy
affix
of
that
would
be
the
less
--
due
less
than
to
carry
out
the
intent
of
congress.
and
i
think
that
in
the
allen
case,
this
court
has
really
held
that
in
substance.
they're
not
the
price
control
regulation
to
involve
that
the
wave
stabilization
is
regulation.
it's
the
same
thing,
a
special
technique
for
reaching
way
stabilization
violations
which
was
held
to
be
preserved
by
the
general
saving
statute
after
the
exploration
of
the
substantive
control
period
in
april,
1953.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
mr.
chief
justice.
in
answer
to
certain
questions
raised
by
the
court
yesterday
as
to
the
--
the
real
life
of
this
issue,
i
had
a
check
made
from
our
statistical
unit
and
i
find
that
we
have
pending
in
our
own
general
litigation
section,
24
live
cases
involving
alleged
violations
of
ops
price
regulations,
that
is
the
korean
war
period.
now,
those
cases
are
all
cases
involving
amounts
over
$2000,
where
the
amount
involved,
it
was
less
than
$2000.
the
enforcement
of
ops
cases
has
been
delegated
directly
to
the
u.s.
attorneys
and
i
have
no
way
of
checking
the
number.
there
are
presumably
quite
a
few
of
those.
we
also
have
pending
in
two
circuit
courts
of
appeals,
in
the
seventh
circuit,
the
william
martin
case,
cases
in
which
district
courts
have
held
price
regulations
invalid
in
enforcement
cases
and
in
those
cases
pending
in
the
circuit
courts.
we
have
advised
the
courts
of
the
pendency
of
this
case.
the
outcome
here
will
determine
those
cases.
there's
another
curios
thing
as
to
the
continuation
of
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
emergency
court
of
appeals
in
the
period
after
active
control.
there's
no
doubt
following
the
world
war
ii
price
control
period,
but
the
emergency
court
of
appeals
continued
to
exercise
exclusive
jurisdiction.
and
there
are
still
large
numbers
of
cases
pending
in
which
that
jurisdiction
is
and
will
be
called
upon,
so
that
if
the
decision
below
were
followed
here,
you'll
have
the
curious
result
of
having
the
emergency
court
of
appeals
continuing
to
exercise
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
world
war
ii
price
control
matters,
while
not
exercising
that
same
jurisdiction
over
the
--
the
post
control
enforcement
cases
arising
out
of
the
korean
war
period.
and
we
think
congress
did
not
intend
any
such
diverted
result,
which
brings
me
to
the
two
things
that
mr.
blackshear
mentioned
here
this
morning.
the
lower
court
cases
that
we
rely
on,
of
course,
we
point
to
--
only
to
illustrate
what
has
happened
both
after
world
war
ii
and
after
the
termination
of
the
korean
war.
in
both
instances,
the
lower
courts
inquiring
into
this
matter
have
determined
that
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
emergency
court
of
appeals
continued.
now,
after
world
war
ii,
chief
judge
magruder
and
judge
matz
and
the
others
inquired
into
their
own
jurisdiction.
it
wouldn't
necessarily
be
a
matter
for
controversy
among
litigants
in
the
emergency
court
of
appeals
because
that
court
would
of
course
be
sensitive
to
the
question
whether
its
own
jurisdiction
in
its
vert
peculiar
respect
continued.
so
that
after
world
war
ii
in
two
decisive
cases,
the
emergency
court
of
appeals
held
that
its
exclusive
jurisdiction
continued
for
the
purpose
of
enforcement
cases
after
the
active
control
period
have
terminated.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
the
two
cases
are
the
150
east
47th
street
court
reporter,
set
forth
on
page
21
of
our
brief,
and
the
standard
kosher
poultry
case
which
is
also
cited
in
our
brief.
that's
163
f.2d
430.
i
was
about
to
point,
mr.
justice
douglas,
to
page
22
of
our
brief
for
the
reason
given.
the
emergency
court
of
appeals
after
world
war
ii
said,
“there
is
no
suggestion
in
section
1
(b),”
that
is
the
savings
prevision
in
the
1942
legislation.
“that
this
statutory
plan,”
that
is
the
relationship
of
the
emergency
court
to
the
whole
question
of
price
control,
“was
to
be
changed
with
respect
to
litigation
pending
after
the
act's
termination
date
and
that
the
complex
relationship
between
enforcement
proceedings
in
other
courts,
and
with
review
proceedings
in
this
court
was
then
to
be
abandoned.”
now,
after
the
korean
war
terminated,
the
emergency
court
again
inquired
and
it
determined
that
the
same
policy
and
same
congressional
purpose
existed,
although
there
was
a
minor
variation
in
the
wording
of
section
706
(b).
now,
i
should
like
to
make
clear
that
we
have
a
--
a
second
line
of
defense
which
i,
in
my
opinion
is
stronger.
we
don't
rely
squarely
and
we
don't
have
to
rely
squarely
on
section
706
(b)
here.
we
say
that
the
general
savings
statute
clearly
applies
here
and
that
this
court
has
so
held
in
allen
against
grand
central,
and
that
the
only
inquiry
as
to
706
(b),
which
needily
made
is
this.
has
congress
by
that
section
or
any
other
section
in
the
1950
act
evidenced
any
intention
that
the
general
savings
statute
not
apply?
general
savings
statute
provides
that
on
the
expiration
of
a
temporary
statute,
it
shall
apply,
unless
congress
expressly
provides
to
the
contrary.
and
we
say
taking
at
a
very
minimum,
section
706
(b)
and
the
experience
following
the
world
war
ii
period,
putting
all
these
things
together,
it
cannot
be
said
that
the
1950
legislation
contains
any
indication
by
congress
that
the
general
savings
statute
do
not
apply.
and
if
the
general
savings
statute
does
apply
by
its
terms,
it
preserves
the
statute
for
the
purpose
of
sustaining
an
enforcement
proceeding.
then,
it's
almost
geometry,
because
if
the
statute
is
sustained,
the
statute
provides
for
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
emergency
court
of
appeals
on
validity
questions
and
then
we
go
on
to
show
that
isn't
--
it's
not
a
mere
technical
or
superficial
matter,
but
that
this
in
fact
carries
out
the
congressional
intent,
uniform
since
1941,
running
right
on
through
the
1950
act.
that
the
emergency
court
of
appeals
exclusively
deal
with
questions
of
validity
arising
in
connection
not
only
with
the
outset
of
the
program
but
with
the
fairness
of
enforcement,
uniformity
of
enforcement,
uniformity
of
result
all
through
the
different
courts
of
the
country.
i
might
say
that
the
1950
legislation
does
contain
a
specific
congressional
affirmation
of
the
policy,
expressed
so
frequently
during
world
war
ii.
we
set
out
at
pages
24
and
25
of
our
brief
the
effort
made
in
1950
by
the
senate
to
again
raise
the
problem
of
giving
concurrent
jurisdiction
to
district
courts.
this
was
defeated
and
the
--
it
was
defeated
after
a
very
careful
consideration.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
senate
who
has
sponsored
it
reported
with
regret
to
the
senate
that
their
efforts
in
that
direction
had
not
been
successful,
but
both
the
house
and
senate
rejected
the
thought
and
reaffirmed
the
principle
that
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
emergency
court
of
appeals
was
the
only
way
of
handing
these
matters.
now,
in
1952,
and
we
point
this
out
on
our
brief
at
page
37.
when
the
1952
congress
relaxed
the
restriction
on
the
power
of
the
emergency
court
of
appeals
to
issue
interlocutory
injunctions
because
the
immediate
urgency
was
over,
the
program
is
well
under
way.
in
1952,
the
congress
again
said
that
the
emergency
court
of
appeals
is
setup
so
that
there
will
not
be
multiplicity
of
opinions
and
that
again
is
an
affirmation
of
the
policy
which
we
say
run
through
the
entire
history
of
this
thing,
that
there'll
be
a
skilled
court
to
give
uniform
expert
opinions
on
matters
of
great
complexity
with
expedition.
and
for
all
of
these
reasons,
we
think
that
the
court
below
erred
in
various
respects
that
their
decision
will
cause
concern
now
and
in
the
future.
we
think
it
defeats
rather
than
carries
out
the
purpose
of
congress
in
the
emergency
court
of
appeals
setup
and
we
think
they're
in
error
in
holding
that
the
--
neither
the
general
savings
statute
nor
section
706
(b)
of
the
1950
act
apply.
we
think
they
both
apply
and
that
the
emergency
court
of
appeals
exclusive
jurisdiction
continues
in
connection
with
post
control
enforcement
cases.
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
in
this
particular
case,
that
--
that
is
so
--
mr.
samuel
d.
slade
well,
with
30
days,
during
which
they
failed
to
file,
it's
provided
by
section
408
(d).
it's
statutory,
the
same
as
this
court's
certiorari
jurisdiction.
so,
when
the
complaint
is
filed
in
30
days,
that
court
had
to
dismiss
for
one
of
jurisdiction,
as
to
tax
court.
it's
the
same
thing.
