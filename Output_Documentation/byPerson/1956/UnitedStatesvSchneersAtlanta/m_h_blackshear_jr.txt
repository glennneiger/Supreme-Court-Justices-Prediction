mr.
m.
h.
blackshear,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
the
argument
which
the
government
makes
for
reversal
here
may
be
summarized
very
briefly
by
a
short
sentence
taken
from
the
government's
brief.
i
quote
that
sentence."
the
decision
below
ignores
the
plain
language
of
the
savings
provision
of
the
defense
production
act,
erroneously
interprets
the
general
savings
statute
and
defeats
to
manifest
purpose
of
congress."
it
should
be
my
purpose
to
undertake
to
demonstrate
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
does
none
of
these
three
things.
the
contention
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
ignores
the
plain
language
of
the
savings
provision
within
the
act,
rests
first
upon
the
proposition
that
similar
jurisdictional
provisions
in
the
emergency
price
control
act
were
held
--
held
by
this
court
to
survive
the
termination
of
that
act
in
the
case,
woods
versus
hill.
in
woods
versus
hill,
this
court
held
that
the
savings
language
which
was
contained
section
1
(b)
of
the
emergency
price
control
act
saved
jurisdiction
of
the
emergency
court
of
appeals
at
the
determination
of
the
act.
second,
that
the
savings
language
of
section
705
(d)
of
the
defense
production
act,
which
is
different
in
phraseology,
is
the
same
in
meaning.
we
believe
that
there
is
a
difference
in
meaning,
and
that
this
meaning
is
immediately
apparent
when
we
compare
the
words
of
two
sections.
section
1
(b)
of
the
price
control
act
in
its
pertinent
part
reads
as
follows.
"the
provisions
of
this
act
and
all
regulations,
orders,
price
schedules,
and
requirements
shall
terminate
on
june
30,
1947,
except
that
as
to
offense
is
committed
or
rights
or
liabilities
incurred,
the
provisions
of
this
act
shall
be
treated
as
still
remaining
in
force
with
the
purpose
of
sustaining
any
proposition
in
the
action
of
prosecution
with
respect
to
such
rights,
liabilities,
or
offenses."
706
(b)
of
the
defense
production
act
in
its
pertinent
part
provides
the
termination
or
the
authority
granted
in
this
act
or
of
any
rule,
regulation,
or
order
issued
thereunder,
shall
not
operate
to
defeat
any
suit,
action,
or
prosecution,
whether
theretofore
thereafter
commenced
with
respect
to
any
right,
liability
or
offense
incurred
or
committed
prior
to
the
termination
date
of
such
title,
of
such
rule,
regulation,
or
order.
we
submit
that
it
is
--
mr.
m.
h.
blackshear,
jr.
the
first
section
that
i
quoted
was
section
1
(b)
of
the
emergency
price
control
act,
which
this
court
construed
in
woods
versus
hill,
in
which
the
government
--
mr.
m.
h.
blackshear,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
--
mr.
m.
h.
blackshear,
jr.
it
is
printed
in
the
government's
brief
at
--
mr.
m.
h.
blackshear,
jr.
page
22,
i
believe.
mr.
m.
h.
blackshear,
jr.
we
submit,
if
the
court
please,
that
it
if
--
it
is
at
once
apparent
for
a
problem,
a
comparison
of
this
language
that
the
two
sections
do
not
make
provision
against
the
same
contingency.
the
emergency
price
control
act
plainly
provides
what
is
to
happen
in
the
event
of
termination
of
the
act.
but
in
the
defense
production
act,
the
contingency
is
not
the
termination
of
the
act
but
the
termination
of
the
authority
granted
in
any
section
or
type
of
any
rule,
regulation,
or
order
issued
thereunder.
now,
authority
under
the
act
could
have
been
terminated
by
executive
order,
or
by
modification,
or
appeal
of
--
of
only
a
portion
of
the
act.
in
fact,
i
believe
that
both
rationing
and
price
control
authority
of
the
price
control
agency
during
world
war
ii
were
terminated
by
executive
action
in
advance
of
the
expiration
or
termination
of
the
emergency
price
control
act.
rules,
regulations,
or
orders,
which
are
mentioned
in
subsection
706
(b),
could
be
revoked
or
changed
by
administrative
action.
706
(b)
makes
it
clear
that
none
of
these
eventualities,
that
is
the
revocation
or
the
modification
of
--
of
orders,
regulations
or
the
expiration
of
authority
contained
in
some
section
of
the
act
would
affect
a
defeat
of
a
crude
action,
suits,
or
prosecution.
the
termination
of
temporary
legislation
would
include
--
would
include
of
course,
a
termination
of
all
authority
granted
in
the
legislation,
but
a
termination
of
authority
would
not
necessarily
extend
to
an
--
a
termination
or
in
expiration
of
the
act.
the
second
material
difference,
the
respondent
contends
is
shown
by
comparison
of
the
two
section.
it's
of
section
706
(b)
of
the
defense
production
act,
makes
no
expressed
effort
by
the
language
employed
to
continue
the
act
in
existence
for
any
purpose.
it
is
provided
only
that
upon
the
happening
of
the
main
contingencies,
the
happening
of
those
contingencies
shall
not
operate
to
defeat
any
suit,
action,
or
prosecution,
but
nothing
as
i
said
--
as
we've
said
in
the
emergency
price
control
act
about
the
continuance
of
the
act
in
existence
for
certain
purposes.
now,
the
government
would
hardly
contend
thatt
to
permit
the
district
court
in
an
enforcement
action
to
consider
a
defense
setting
up
the
invalidity
of
the
regulation,
would
operate
to
defeat
the
enforcement
action
in
the
sense
of
causing
the
government
to
loose
its
suit.
but
in
effect,
it
makes
this
same
assertion
by
stating
at
page
5
of
its
brief,
that
by
so
allowing
the
district
court
to
pass
on
validity,
permits
the
defeat
of
an
enforcement
action
in
a
manner
not
theretofore
partial.
and
by
implying
that
so
to
permit
the
defeat
of
an
enforcement
action
has
the
same
meaning
as
to
operate
to
defeat
the
enforcement
action.
we
submit
that
this
contention
and
construction
is
not
warranted
or
justified
by
the
language.
the
government
relies
upon
decisions
of
certain
courts
of
appeals,
including
the
emergency
court
of
appeals.
insofar
as
the
decisions
of
the
emergency
court
of
appeals,
express
the
view
that
it's
exclusive
jurisdiction
continues
after
the
expiration
of
the
act.
we
submit
that
the
only
person
who
could
have
well
raised
a
question
is
the
very
person
who
obtained
leave
to
file
proceeding
in
the
emergency
court
and
who
has,
by
filing
that
proceeding,
invoked
the
jurisdiction.
i
do
not
believe
that
any
of
the
decisions
referred
to
in
the
government's
brief
upon
this
point,
decisions
by
emergency
court
of
appeals
or
decisions
by
the
courts
of
appeals
from
the
various
circuits,
involve
an
actual
adversary
contest
on
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
if
there
is
such
a
decision,
then
i
believe
it
is
that
of
united
states
against
dix
box
in
the
ninth
circuit.
so
far
as
united
states
against
dix
box,
holds
to
the
contrary
of
the
position
on
which
we
insist,
we
submit
that
it
is
wrongly
decided
and
should
not
be
followed
in
the
decision
of
the
case
at
bar.
one
of
the
cases
cited
by
the
government
is
that
in
the
haldeman
creamery
company
against
kendall,
decided
in
the
emergency
court
of
appeals.
in
that
case,
we
should
point
out
that
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
termination
of
the
act
did
in
one
situation,
had
the
result
of
defeating
the
action.
the
haldeman
creamery
case
was
a
case
in
which
proceeding
had
been
started
in
the
emergency
court
of
appeals
to
review
the
validity
of
a
price
control
order,
independent
of
any
enforcement
proceeding.
the
emergency
court
of
appeals
held
that
its
continued
jurisdiction
was
only
with
respect
to
enforcement
action,
that
there
was
no
enforcement
action
pending
or
contemplated
so
far
as
the
record
shows
in
the
haldeman
creamery
case
and
that
therefore,
its
jurisdiction
to
consider
matters
of
that
type
was
at
an
end.
since
there
is
such
a
material
difference
in
the
language
in
section
1
(b)
of
the
price
control
act
and
706
(b)
of
the
defense
production
act,
we
submit
that
this
court's
decision
in
woods
versus
hill
has
no
bearing
on
the
case
at
bar
and
should
not
be
followed.
the
government
also
contends
that
the
respondent
has
shown
no
reason
why
congress
should
have
decided
to
change
its
policy
with
respect
to
continued
jurisdiction,
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
emergency
court
of
appeals
on
questions
of
this
type
after
the
termination
of
the
act.
we
submit
that
these
are
different
acts
passed
by
different
congressmen.
the
government
has
failed,
we
believe,
to
put
its
finger
upon
any
language
in
the
latter
act
which
evinces
an
intention
to
follow
the
same
policy
followed
in
the
defense
production
act.
and
we
say
that
there
is
no
reason
to
assume
that
congress
have
--
should
have
desired
of
--
of
giving
voice
to
the
same
sort
of
policy
as
embodied
in
the
earlier
act.
certainly,
it
is
not
encumber
upon
respondent
to
show
that
there
were
some
reason
why
congress
did
not
follow
a
prior
legislation.
in
this
connection,
we
believe
that
perhaps
language
used
by
this
court
in
the
insurance
company
against
ritchie
may
be
put
in
dealing
with
a
similar
situation.
in
insurance
company
versus
ritchie,
the
court
stated
that
perhaps
the
result
that
its
interpretation
gave
to
the
act
on
the
construction
was
not
what
was
intended
by
congress
but
then
stated
and
i
quote,
"but
when
terms
are
unambiguous
we
not
--
may
not
speculate
on
probabilities
or
intentions."
the
government
in
its
brief
has
undertaken
to
show
some
legislative
history,
varying
upon
the
question
of
contingent
exclusive
jurisdiction,
but
we
believe
that
a
reading
of
that
legislative
history
will
show
that
congress
did
not
give
any
expression
as
to
its
purpose
or
its
intention
in
the
--
in
the
history
made
in
this
legislation
as
to
the
problem
that
exist
in
the
case
at
bar.
the
savings
clause
contained
in
the
defense
production
act,
embodied
in
section
706,
is
included
in
the
same
section
which
makes
a
number
of
provisions
with
regard
to
procedure.
it
is
the
section
that
contains
the
authority
to
institute
injunction
suit.
it
is
the
section
that
contains
special
venue
provision.
it
is
the
section
which
contains
authority
in
the
price
administrator
to
maintain
action
to
recover
treble
damages.
and
we
believe
and
urge
that
the
fact
that
this
section
contains
these
procedures
and
these
grants
of
authority,
makes
it
specially
meaningful
the
language
that
the
termination
of
authority
shall
not
operate
to
defeat
any
suit,
action,
or
prosecution.
the
government
has
also
relied
upon
the
decision
of
this
court
in
allen
against
grand
central
aircraft
company.
we
submit
that
it
is
significant
that
allen
against
grand
central
aircraft
company
is
not
rested
upon
the
savings
language
contained
in
the
defense
production
act
but
is
rested
on
the
general
savings
statute.
in
the
grand
central
aircraft
case,
it
was
stated
that
there
was
no
expressed
or
implied
provision
in
the
defense
production
act,
contrary
to
the
general
savings
statute.
of
course,
the
court
in
dealing
with
that
matter
and
so
expressing
its
views
was
considering
whether
or
not
there
was
anything
in
the
defense
production
act
which
cut
down
and
narrowed
the
scope
of
the
general
savings
statute.
but
if
there
is
no
implied
provision
contrary
to
the
general
savings
statute
and
no
expressed
provision
contrary
to
the
general
savings
statute,
does
that
not
mean
that
the
defense
production
act
in
its
savings
language
is
neither
broader
nor
narrower
than
the
general
savings
statute?
so,
we
come
to
what
we
submit
is
the
main
question
and
the
only
real
question
in
this
case
and
that
is
whether
or
not
the
general
savings
statute
saves
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
emergency
court
of
appeals
and
saves
this
limitation
on
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
to
decide
questions
of
validity
of
the
statute.
the
government
contends
that
the
decision
in
the
de
la
rama
steamship
company
case
is
read
by
the
respondent
too
narrowly.
when
we
argue
as
we
do
at
page
10
of
our
brief,
the
de
la
rama
stands
only
for
the
proposition
that
special
procedures
are
saved
when
they're
necessary
to
save
substantive
rights.
as
we
read
the
government's
brief,
the
government's
contention
as
the
de
la
rama
stands
for
the
proposition
that
whenever
--
whenever
special
procedures
are
contained
in
an
act,
which
confirms
substantive
right,
that
the
expiration
of
that
act,
be
it
a
temporary
act
or
the
repeal
of
that
act
if
it
is
permanent
legislation,
will
lead
in
effect
both
to
special
procedure
and
the
substantive
rights.
and
this
is
a
result
of
the
general
savings
statute.
we
submit
that
de
la
rama
does
not
lay
down
so
broader
rule.
in
order
to
give
de
la
rama
such
a
broad
meaning,
it
would
be
necessary
to
not
only
repudiate
the
implied
teachings
of
number
of
verdict
cases
which
we
have
cited
and
relied
upon
in
our
brief,
but
in
effect,
to
overrule
sub
silentio,
the
quick
case
of
great
northern
railway
against
united
states,
which
was
not
even
mentioned
in
the
de
la
rama
decision
nor
in
--
nor
in
the
allen
against
grand
central
aircraft.
the
third
argument
that
the
government
makes
for
reversal
is
the
decision
of
the
court
below
that
reached
the
manifested
purpose
of
congress.
the
argument
is
that
congress
has
established
a
policy
of
having
all
questions
of
price
regulations
passed
upon
by
a
single
court.
and
that
the
reason
it
has
done
so
is
in
order
to
have
a
court
of
special
--
a
court
that
has
some
special
expert
acquittance
with
the
price
control
program,
as
well
as
to
meet
the
problem
of
need
for
urgency
in
enforcement.
the
decision
in
the
yates
case,
i
believe
it
is,
points
out
that
the
principal
need
for
having
questions
of
validity
of
price
regulations
passed
on
by
a
special
court
is
that
if
problems
and
questions
of
validity
of
regulation
have
passed
on
by
a
number
district
courts
and
by
a
number
of
circuit
courts
of
appeals,
during
the
periods
of
active
enforcement.
that
then,
different
decisions
by
different
insurgence
will
result
in
inequality
of
application
of
price
regulation.
we
think
that
the
language
of
chief
justice
vinson
in
that
case
makes
it
clear
that
the
great
danger
in
such
lack
of
uniformity
is
that
scarce
commodities
are
channeled
to
those
areas
where
the
acts
had
been
held
to
be
invalid
and
that
before
the
difference
in
decisions
by
courts
of
appeals
can
be
reconciled
in
this
court.
irreparable
damage
has
been
done
to
the
economy
of
the
country
and
economic
distortions
of
all
sorts
have
reserved.
we
believe
that
the
references
that
have
been
made
to
the
special
expertise
of
the
emergency
court
of
appeals
are
not
controlling
reasons
why
that
court
has
been
invested
with
the
jurisdiction
that
he
had
passed
--
exercised
but
that
it
is
purely
make
way.
now,
the
period
of
active
enforcement
and
active
administration
of
price
regulation
has
--
has
ended
under
this
act.
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
has
pointed
out,
there
will
be
no
inconvenience
to
either
party
to
allow
matter
to
be
settled
in
its
more
usual
and
more
ordinary
manner
by
allowing
the
district
court
to
pass
on
all
issues
in
the
case.
