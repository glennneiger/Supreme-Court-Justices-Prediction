you
said
“if,”
mr.
slade.
what
is
the
present
status
in
that
court
fully
apart
from
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
there
any
sort
of
that
hanging
over
them
or
are
they
--
it's
going
on
until
somebody
stops
it,
there's
nobody
stopping
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
this
is
the
brink
of
this
decision
in
all
questions
that
are
gathered
for
had
to
be
brought
before
the
emergency
court
that
--
that
too?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
this
is
--
if
the
--
this
decision
is
brought,
this
decision
calls
for
reversion,
then
the
litigation
before
the
emergency
court
will
be
correspondingly
modified,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
it,
much
applied
to
what
it
now
has.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
quite
follow.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
--
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
putting
up
for
litigation
involves
validity
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
i
get
the
practical
effect
of
this?
i
mean,
in
what
country?
does
this
mean
that
the
validity
of
the
regulation
sought
to
be
enforced
of
all
this
--
there's
a
large
network
of
(inaudible)
case
that
i
have
to
write
and
meet
these,
all
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
countless
network
of
complicated,
the
regulation
under
the
validity
of
the
fact
now
has
to
be
decided
in
any
particular
district
court
with
importance,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
