mr.
kneland
c.
tanner
may
it
please,
your
honors.
these
cases
are
here
on
certiorari
from
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
petitioners
are
complaining
of
judgments
for
damages
which
were
entered
against
them
in
the
district
court
of
oregon
in
suits
brought
by
the
respondent
to
enjoin
the
picketing
of
respondent's
vessel
the
s.s.
riviera.
the
ship,
at
the
time
of
the
picketing
by
the
petitioners,
and
for
more
than
a
month
prior
to
the
activities
of
these
petitioners,
was
moored
at
the
dock
in
the
willamette
river
in
the
port
of
portland.
no
claim
has
been
made
by
the
respondents
that
the
activities
in
and
of
themselves
and
dissociated
from
their
objectives
were
illegal
either
under
oregon
law
or
federal
law.
the
picketing
was
peaceful.
it
occurred
on
the
dock.
there
was
no
trespassing
and
it
was
unaccompanied
by
violence,
threats
or
intimidation
of
any
kind.
indeed,
when
the
picketing
was
commenced
by
benz
of
the
sailors'
union
pacific,
the
respondents
went
in
to
the
state
court
with
an
application
for
an
injunction.
and
their
application,
a--
a
demurrer
was
interposed
to
their
complaint.
the
demurrer
was
sustained
and
they
then
filed
an
amended
complaint
to
which
a
demurrer
was
sustained
and
the
amended
complaint
that
--
that
they
then
filed
is
--
was
in
substantially
the
same
form
that
was
filed
by
the
respondent
against
benz
in
the
federal
district
court
invoking
the
jurisdiction
of
that
court
by
reason
of
the
diversity
of
citizenship
and
the
necessary
amount
in
controversy.
the
--
the
district
court
--
the
federal
district
court
thought
that
the
activities
of
the
pickets
were
wrongful
by
reason
of
the
mental
processes
or
the
objectives
of
the
pickets.
he
thought
that
their
objectives
were
unworthy
of
attainment,
and
issued
a
temporary
injunction.
the
picketing
stopped
upon
the
issuance
of
the
injunctions
and
the
vessel
signed
on
a
new
crew.
this
--
their
crew
that
brought
the
vessel
into
portland
on
the
3rd
of
september
had
been
discharged
by
the
respondents.
that
is,
the
unlicensed
personnel.
i
think
there
were
some
five
or
six
licensed
officers
still
aboard
the
ship,
but
the
unlicensed
personnel
had
been
discharged.so
that
the
vessel
was
there
in
portland
without
a
crew
and
there
were
some
23
or
25
jobs
available.
an
--
an
appeal
was
taken
from
this
temporary
injunction
pursuant
to
the
statute.
but
the
court
of
appeals
thought
the
controversy
with
respect
to
the
injunctions
had
become
moot
because
the
vessel,
after
it
had
attained
a
new
crew
and
i
think
this
new
crew
was
employed
in
the
vicinity
of
vancouver,
they
were
employed
on
the
west
coast
and
they
were
put
aboard
the
ship.
and
the
ship
had
sailed.
so,
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
so
far
as
the
injunctions
were
concerned,
the
controversy
had
become
moot.
and
we
applied
to
this
court
for
certiorari
and
our
application
was
denied.
the
cases
were
then
consolidated
for
trial
on
the
merits
and
upon
the
issue
of
damages
with
the
provision
that
it
was
to
be
tried
without
prejudice
to
the
rights
of
the
defendants
in
the
case,
the
--
the
petitioners
here,
with
respect
to
urge
the
question
of
the
--
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
in
the
premises
not
only
to
--
to
assess
damages
or
jurisdiction
in
the
premises.
i
assume
that
was
what
the
reservation
was
intended
for.
now,
the
--
the
trial
court,
on
the
basis
of
the
trial
court's
decision,
was
apparently
based
upon
a
--
a
doctrine
that
has
drawn
up,
it
had
its
beginning,
i
--
i
believe,
in
the
interpretation
of
a
--
a
labor
dispute
under
the
norris-laguardia
act.
some
of
the
courts
felt
that
if
the
objectives
were
unworthy
of
attainment,
as
the
controversy
ceased
be
a
labor
dispute.
and
so
the
trial
court
made
the
question
of
the
objectives
of
these
petitioners,
the
important
matter
upon
which
the
--
apparently
the
trial
court
had
based
its
decision.
now,
the
findings
followed
very
closely
the
allegations
of
the
respondent's
complaint.
and
in
that
complaint,
the
respondents
alleged
that
the
defendants
and
the
persons
represented
by
them
have
picketed
and
cause
to
be
picketing
the
ship
and
now
i
quote
from
this,
what
appears
on
484
of
the
record,
wherein
it
says,
"whereby
the
employees
of
independent
contractors
with
whom
the
plaintiff
had
contracts
had
been
persuaded
and
induced
not
to
carry
on
their
work
aboard
said
vessel."
how,
that
language
means
and
can
only
mean
that
these
pickets
had
persuaded
the
employees
of
independent
contractors
to
strike
against
their
employer
for
the
purpose
of
inducing
their
employer
not
to
do
business
with
the
respondent.
and
that,
i
submit,
was
one
of
the
things
that
congress
wanted
to
reach
when
it
proscribed
certain
objectives
that
they
thought
were
not
conducive
to
harmonious
industrial
relations.
mr.
kneland
c.
tanner
at
page
484.
and
then
again
in
paragraph
5
of
the
complaint,
and
that's
found
on
page
486
of
the
record.
we
find
this
significant
allegation
which
i
think
aids
in
interpreting
what
they
meant
when
they
said
they
had
persuaded
employees
of
other
employers
to
go
on
strike
or
that
is
not
to
work
for
their
employer.
they
alleged
that
benz
and
his
associates
--
they
--
they
alleged
that
as
a
result
of
the
picketing
of
the
steamship
riviera
by
the
defendants
on
each
of
them
the
vessel
has
been
idle
since
september
the
26th,
1952.
and
they
alleged
that
the
employees
of
contractors
with
whom
the
plaintiff
had
entered
into
contracts
for
the
repair
and
preparation
of
the
vessel
to
carry
her
cargo
of
grain
to
india
have
refused
to
perform
their
duties
on
board
the
vessel.
and
the
plaintiff
has
been
unable
to
carry
out
its
obligations
under
the
charter
party
and
its
right
to
pursue
the
vessel's
voyage.
now,
that
that
allegation
would
indicate
that
the
picketing
had
that
result
and
that
the
picketing
was
in
or
did,
in
fact,
persuade.
now,
with
respect
to
the
intent
to
persuade
are
the
mental
processes
of
the
objectives,
the
court
made
that
abundantly
clear
in
its
findings
and
conclusions
which
appear
on
page
241
of
the
record.
and
we
think
this
is
of
paramount
importance.
on
october
the
14th,
that
was
when
this
picketing
commenced,
members
of
the
--
and
i'm
quoting
now
from
the
findings,
"members
of
the
sailors'
union
of
the
pacific
acting
pursuant
to
a
resolution
duly
adopted
by
the
union,
commenced
picketing
the
vessel
and
continued
to
picket
it
until
restrained
and
enjoined
from
further
picketing
by
this
court
on
november
26,
1952."
that?s
in
findings
of
fact
number
11.
and
then
on
that
--
on
the
following
page,
we
have
the
court's
finding
with
respect
to
the
specific
intent
wherein
the
court
said,
"the
said
picketing
by
members
of
the
sailors'
union
of
the
pacific
was
intending
to
prevent
the
loading
of
the
s.
s.
riviera.
now,
we
--
we
submit
that
--
mr.
kneland
c.
tanner
that
is
--
mr.
kneland
c.
tanner
finding
11,
finding
of
fact
11,
on
241
of
the
record.
now,
i
have
probably
omitted
some
other
findings.
i
want,
and
i'm
going
to
come
back
to
some
of
these
findings
but
because
i
thought
they
were
somewhat
contradictions.
the
resolution
which
the
court
found
motivated
the
picket's
ends,
to
which
i
think
we
have
to
look
to,
to
find
out
what
their
objectives
were,
shows
the
motives
which
prompted
the
activities
of
the
petitioner.
and
those
motives,
that
resolution
itself
is
found
on
page
416
and
420
of
the
record.
it
was
made
a
pretrial
exhibit
and
it
was
probably
made
the
basis,
i
think,
of
the
court
--
of
the
lower
court's
decision.
it
was
made
a
part
of
benz's
as
affidavit
on
opposition
to
the
respondent's
application
to
temporary
injunction
as
we
thought
that
that
clearly
showed
a
labor
dispute
that
they
were
trying
to
further
their
economic
interest.
the
resolution
which
they,
which
the
court
did
find,
motivated
the
picketing
of
the
vessel
it
described
the
conditions
aboard
the
ship
which
made
the
vessel
clearly
unseaworthy.
it
referred
to
the
suicide
of
one
of
the
crew
while
the
vessel
came
along
inside
the
dock
in
portland
because,
so
the
resolution
stated.
this
crew
member
preferred
a
quick
death
to
the
slow
suffering
death
which
he
felt
would
be
his
fate
if
he
stayed
aboard
the
vessel.
and
then
it
also
recited
the
request
which
the
crew
had
made
of
the
sailors'
union
for
assistance
before
they
were
put
off
the
vessel
by
the
order
which
the
respondent
obtained
from
the
district
court.
it
referred
to
the
action
of
the
immigration
authorities
in
putting
the
men
in
jail
immediately
after
they
came
ashore
and
later
ordering
them
to
deport.
now,
these
orders
of
deportation
were
made
prior
to
this
picketing.
these
orders
of
deportation
were
made
october
8
and
9.
some
five
days
before
the
picketing
of
this
union
commenced
and
for
which
the
court
allowed
benz
as
against
these
petitioners,
the
concluding
recital
of
the
resolution
of
which
preceded
the
resolution,
we
think,
is
also
significant
because
it,
too
shows
an
economic
interest.
whereas,
this
company,
because
of
the
conditions
that
existed
on
board
the
s.
s.
riviera
and
the
way
it
has
treated
the
crew
of
the
s.
s.
riviera,
and
the
low
wage
rate
it
is
paying
on
other
ships
operated
by
it,
is
unfair
to
the
sailors'
union
of
the
pacific
and
other
legitimate
seamen
unions
all
over
the
world.
now,
and
that
the
court
did
make
in
paragraph
12
of
the
court's
findings,
a
finding
that
i
think
they're
relying
on
here
and
expect,
i
assume
they
have
to
justify
this
judgment,
it
seems
to
me
that
they
have
to
expect
this
court
to
ignore
these
other
findings,
because
in
these
findings
it
says,
the
court
said,
this
is
found
on
242
of
the
transcript,
its
finding
12,
paragraph
12.
the
sole
purposes
of
the
said
picketings
by
members
of
the
sailors'
union
of
the
pacific
was
to
compel
the
plaintiff
to
reemploy
said
discharged
striking
members
of
the
crew
of
said
s.
s.
riviera
for
a
shorter
period
and
that's
stated
in
the
articles.
and
that
wage
rates
and
other
conditions
that
were
more
favorable
to
them
than
those
stated
in
the
articles.
now
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
--
this
member
of
the
crew
had
been
put
off
the
ship,
they
had
been
ordered
deported,
it
seems
to
us
that
one
would
have
to
have
greater
insight
into
the
future
to
attribute
to
these
seamen,
that
this
order
of
deportation
would
be
reversed
by
the
board
of
appeals.
it
was
and
it
had
been
reversed
prior
to
the
making
of
this
finding.
it
was
reversed
on
november
the
28th.
but
at
the
--
but
at
the
time
this
picketing
commenced,
these
men
had
been
ordered
deported
and
it
was
clear
that
from
the
other
findings
that
and
from
other
testimony
that
they
were
furthering
their
own
economic
interest
because
that
crew
had
been
ordered
deported,
some
23
of
them.
and
they
were
off
the
ship
and
the
owners
were
--
would
of
necessity,
have
to
employ
a
new
crew
while
--
because
the
vessel
was
there
along
the
side
of
the
dock.
now,
the
judgment
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
apparent,
along
on
the
authority
of
this
court
in
laburnum.
mr.
kneland
c.
tanner
yes.
i
think
it's
contrary
to
other
findings.
i
think
you
have
to
take
all
these
findings
together.
mr.
kneland
c.
tanner
the
word
"sole",
i
--
i
think
it's
clearly
contradictory
to
other
findings.
mr.
kneland
c.
tanner
no.
mr.
kneland
c.
tanner
no.
i
think
there
was
evidence
to
support
that
was
part
of
the
mental
processes
of
these
pickets.
i
think
it
was,
but
--
mr.
kneland
c.
tanner
--
i
don't
think
it
was
the
sole
mental
process.
mr.
kneland
c.
tanner
well,
i
assume
that
you
can
take
these
findings
in
their
entirety.
now,
i
am
asking
this
court
to
take
the
findings
in
their
entirety
and
to
not
take
the
word
"sole"
because
it's
contrary
to
what
other
findings
that
the
court
made.
that's
my
position
with
respect
to
that,
but
i
think
that
this
judgment
should
be
aware,
we
don't
--
we
still
think
that
this
judgment
can't
be
sustained
if
you
accept
that
finding.
i
don't
want
to
leave
the
impression
that
that
finding
is
determinative
of
the
issues
in
this
case.
i
don't
think
it
is.
i
think
that
these
crew
members
that
came
to
the
sailors'
union
had
a
right
regardless
of
their
misconduct
to
have
a
representative.
mr.
kneland
c.
tanner
i
can't
answer
that.
whether
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
go
off
on
that,
the
court
of
appeals
went
off
on
something
else.
mr.
kneland
c.
tanner
i
can't
--
i
--
i
--
if
they
did,
there
was
nothing
in
their
opinion
that
they
acted
solely
upon
that
particular
finding
that
i've
been
able
to
find
out
or
ascertain.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
judgment
upon
laburnum
and
i
think
the
united
construction
workers
case
versus
laburnum
and
i
think
in
that
case
there
was
a
gross
misapprehension
of
the
law.
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
because
the
picket
that
had
caused
damage
for
which
no
remedy
was
provided
by
the
national
labor
relations
act,
it
concluded
from
that
fact,
the
fact
of
causing
damage
that
--
that
the
pickets
and
their
activities
were
wrong
and
they
held
that
it
--
and
as
laburnum
said,
they
--
even
though
those
activities
might
--
and
constitute
an
unfair
labor
practice.
now,
laburnum
failed
to
distinguish,
as
the
court
did
in
distinguishing
laburnum,
it
failed
to
ascertain
that
in
laburnum,
the
activities
in
and
of
themselves
were
tortious.
there
was
--
the
activities
were
wrong.
that's
why
laburnum
was
affirmed.
here,
if
they're
wrongful
at
all,
it's
wrongful
because
of
their
mental
processes,
their
hopes,
their
aspirations,
their
objectives.
now,
i
think
in
this
court's
case
in
--
in
the
--
in
this
court's
opinion
in
weber
versus
anheuser-busch,
they
make
it
very
clear
that
if
the
activities
are
lawful,
if
the
--
if
the
things
that
they
do
are
not
tortious
their
--
their
activity
or
their
objectives
--
those
objectives
that
are
wrongful
are
the
ones
that
commerce
has
proscribed.
and
i
think
there
was
some
five
of
them.
it's
--
it
was
for
the
congress
in
our
view
of
the
law,
to
make
raw
--
to
determine
the
wrongfulness
of
objectives
and
they
didn't
say
--
the
congress
didn't
say
that
it
was
a
wrongful
objective
to
represent
a
mutinous
crew.
so,
you
can
accept
that
finding
as
we
view
the
law
and
say
that
they
were
as
--
it's
been
argued
at
great
length
in
their
brief
that
this
mutinous
crew
that
this
finding
says,
we
were
wanting
to
represent
were
so
unworthy
of
representation
that
they
were
not
entitled
to
have
a
representative.
and
in
--
and
they
made
that
objective
a
wrongful
act.
now,
if
congress
had
wanted
to
let
these
courts
determine
the
rightfulness
or
wrongfulness
of
the
objectives,
they
could
have
done
so.
they
--
they
knew
how
to
say
that
certain
objectives
were
wrongful.
and
they
--
they
set
it
out
very
clearly
that
if
you
--
these
concerted
activities
on
inducing
people
to
strike
to
accomplish
certain
objectives
if
--
if
those
objectives
are
for
the
things
that
congress
has
proscribed,
then,
it
becomes
actionable
on
unfair
labor
practice.
but
i
don't
think
it's
for
the
courts
to
set
their
standards
of
the
reasonableness,
of
the
hopes
and
ambitions
or
the
objectives
of
the
pickets.
and
i
think
this
court
made
that
very
clear
in
the
new
negro
alliance
case,
the
one
they
were
construing
the
--
the
norris-laguardia
act
that
this
question
of
a
labor
dispute
was
not
to
turn
on
the
merit
or
lack
of
merit.
they
had
defined
the
labor
dispute
in
pretty
clear
terms.
and
so
here,
we
believe
that
the
congress
has
proscribed
certain
things
that
the
congress
thought
were
not
worthy
of
attainment,
were
not
conducive
to
industrial
--
good
industrial
relations
and
they
proscribed
picketing
and
activities
that
were
--
that
had
those
things
as
an
objective.
mr.
kneland
c.
tanner
that's
right.
and
they
had
signed
on,
yes,
and
they
had
signed
at
various
ports.
mr.
kneland
c.
tanner
and
that's
what
the
finding
said.
mr.
kneland
c.
tanner
i
think
so.
that's
right.
mr.
kneland
c.
tanner
that's
our
position.
i
think
that
these
objectives
are
--
because
if
--
if
these
things
come
within
the
prohibitions
or
the
proscriptive
activities
or
proscriptive
objectives,
i
should
say,
then
if
they
--
if
they
don't
come
within
that,
then,
i
think
that
their
activities
if
they're
lawful
in
and
of
themselves
and
they've
not
encountered
in
any
unlawful
conduct,
i
think
that
their
activities
which
i
think
are
protective
activities
under
section
7
of
the
act.
and
i
think
that
was
made
abundantly
clear
by
--
justice
--
the
late
justice
jackson
and
it
was
quoted
with
approval
and
i
--
i
think
that
that
is
at
this
paragraph
shows
the,
what
we
believe
is
the
proper
construction
of
the
law.
and
i'm
reading
from
this
--
from
justice
frankfurter's
opinion
wherein
he
quoted
justice
jackson's
opinion
in
the
garner
case
and
this
is
what
we
think
is
the
law.
the
detailed
proscription
of
the
procedure
for
restraint
of
specified
types
of
picketing
would
seem
to
imply
that
other
picketing
is
to
be
free
of
other
methods
and
sources
of
restraint
and
that
includes,
of
course,
restraints
by
the
state
court
injunctions
and
federal
judges
sitting
in
diversity
cases.
for
the
policy
of
the
national
labor
management
relations
act
is
not
to
condemn
all
picketing
but
only
that
ascertained
by
its
proscribed
processes
to
fall
within
its
prohibitions.
otherwise,
it
is
implicit
in
the
act
that
the
public
interest
is
served
by
freedom
of
labor
to
use
the
weapon
of
picketing.
for
a
state
to
impinge
on
the
area
of
labor
combat,
designed
to
be
free
is
quite
an
obstruction,
if
--
as
much
an
obstruction
of
federal
policy
as
if
the
state
were
to
declare
picketing
free
for
purposes
or
methods
which
the
federal
act
prohibits.
and
we
think
there
was
enough
in
this
case
to
bring
it
within
the
purview
of
the
provisions
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
it
was
for
the
board
to
ascertain
what
those
objectives
were
and
not
for
the
court.
mr.
kneland
c.
tanner
i
would
think
so.
certainly,
this
owner
would
be
a
person.
mr.
kneland
c.
tanner
yes.
they
had
been
--
well,
they
--
so,
i
don't
think
that
they
--
they
had
been
discharged,
justice
douglas.
i
think
that
--
that
the
--
the
pertinence,
that
they
obtained
their
discharge
by
a
judicial
determination
of
their
discharge.
they
went
into
court
and
ignored
the
treaty
of
the
flag
which
gave
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
the
counsel
of
the
country
under
whose
this
flag
sailed.
that
they
ignored
the
provisions
of
the
treaty
which
gave
the
counsel
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
that
internal
discipline
that
they
were
confronted
with
they
went
into
court
and
put
the
men
off
the
ship
and
terminated
very
effectively
their
employment.
so
as
we
view
this
matter
this
was
a
foreign
shipowner
with
a
ship
that
had
been
at
the
dock,
in
need
of
a
crew
and
that
--
that
people
--
that
these
pickets
on
whose
behalf
they
were
acting
were
eligible
for
employment,
the
master
so
testified.
mr.
kneland
c.
tanner
oh,
i
--
i
think
they
were
discharged.
mr.
kneland
c.
tanner
no.
i
don't
want
you
to
go
back
in
that.
i
--
i
say
that
--
that
you
take
the
ship
as
if
it
was
there,
that
this
was
a
form.
it
had
a
ship.
it
was
in
need
of
a
crew.
the
people
that
these
pickets
represented
had
an
interest
in
economic
conditions
that
prevailed
the
aboard
the
ship.
and
they
had
the
right
to
use
peaceful
activities
or
activities
that
was
for
their
mutual
aid
and
protection
that
wasn't,
not
unlawful
to
further
their
economic
interest
and
to
publicize
the
conditions
as
aboard
--
their
conditions
--
their
conditions
that
suggested
aboard
the
ship,
including
the
low
wages
which
the
owners
of
the
ship
proposed
to
pay
to
the
new
crew.
mr.
kneland
c.
tanner
i
just
want
to
make
one
observation
i
trust
the
court
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
cases
cited
including
the
southern
steamship
case,
the
court
was
dealing
with
a
remedy
or
a
right
that
the
--
that
the
parties
that
were
--
had
committed
the
wrongful
conduct
is
still
board
on
the
southern
steamship
case
gave
some
relief
to
men
which
this
court
held
was
unworthy
of
relief.
whereas,
in
this
case,
the
--
the
remedy
or
the
damages
is,
against
these
--
these
individual
petitioners
who
are
pursuing
their
own
individual
rights
and
their
own
economic
interests.
it
wasn't
for
the
benefit
of
this
crew
and
that
judgment
wasn't
against
this
crew
nor
for
their
benefit.
that's
what
i
think
is
important.
