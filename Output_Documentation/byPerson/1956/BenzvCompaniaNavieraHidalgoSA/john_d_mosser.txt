mr.
john
d.
mosser
may
it
please
the
court.
with
all
due
respect
to
counsel
for
the
petitioners,
i
believe
the
he
has
departed
from
the
record
at
times
and
has
not
given
the
full
findings
which
govern
this
case
and
which
i
think
bring
the
questions
of
law
into
sharp
focus.
i
do
think
the
findings
as
made
by
the
district
court
control
here.
some
of
them
were
attacked
in
the
court
of
appeals,
but
the
court
of
appeals
disturbed
none
of
them.
and
they
are
thus
findings
which
have
passed
the
two
courts
below.
now,
this
key
finding,
as
to
the
purpose
of
the
picketing,
needs
a
little
background
for
understanding.
the
riviera
had
a
crew
of
foreign
nationals,
german
and
british
mostly,
who
had
signed
a
british
form
of
articles
providing
for
service
for
a
period
of
two
years
or
until
the
vessels
returned
to
a
european
port.
those
articles
were
in
effect
when
the
ship
reached
portland,
oregon
and
had
only
been
in
effect
for
some
four
or
five
months.
the
crew
of
the
vessel,
after
that
the
ship
had
been
in
port
for
a
few
days,
went
on
a
strike,
a
sitdownstrike.
a
specific
plea
refused
to
obey
the
orders
of
the
master
to
continue
about
their
normal
duties
aboard
the
ship.
they
refused
his
order,
if
they
were
not
going
to
do
that,
to
leave
the
vessel.
they
were
removed
from
the
ship.
they
left
voluntarily
but
only
after
an
order
of
the
district
court
had
been
entered
upon
a
possessory
libel
l
which
was
filed
by
the
respondent,
ordering
them
to
leave
the
ship.
now,
it
is
true
that
they
were
then
had
taken
into
custody
by
immigration.
but
i
want
to
point
out
on
page
18
of
the
record
among
the
agreed
facts
in
this
case
was
the
fact,
and
i'm
quoting
at
all
times
said,
"immigration
and
naturalization
service
was
willing
to
allow
voluntary
departure
by
said
crew
members
aboard
the
s.
s.
riviera
if
reemployed
aboard
that
vessel."
so,
i
think
this
argument
that
the
unions
couldn't
possibly
have
been
picketing
for
their
reemployment
falls
on
that
agreed
fact.
after
this
possessory
libel,
the
crewmen
themselves
who
libeled
the
vessel
claiming
wages,
transportation
to
their
ports
in
europe
where
they
had
signed
on
and
penalties
under
the
u.s.
statutes
because
of
alleged
unseaworthiness
of
this
vessel.
now,
most
of
the
testimony
in
this
voluminous
record
reduced
to
narrative
form
was
taken
in
that
case
and
incorporated
here
by
stipulation.
the
counsel
failed
to
mention
the
finding
of
the
court
which
is
found
on
page
242,
i
believe,
to
the
effect
that
--
no,
it's
on
page
240,
the
similar
finding
in
each
of
the
other
cases,
finding
8.
plaintiff
complied
of
its
obligations
under
the
terms
of
the
ship's
articles
and
the
contract
governing
the
relations
between
the
plaintiff
and
the
members
of
the
crew
of
said
vessel.
now,
if
you
want
more
detailed
findings
that
were
made
in
that
earlier
case,
you
will
find
them
in
the
record
beginning
at
page
432
where
the
district
judge
separately
took
off
and
made
findings
on
each
of
the
allegations
of
unseaworthiness
that
had
been
made
by
the
crew
members.
he
found
that
the
respondent
had
fully
performed
its
contract
and
that
the
vessel
was
seaworthy.
now,
at
the
time
these
crewmen
went
and
started
their
sitdown
strike,
they
put
a
picket
on
the
vessel,
announcing
their
dispute
with
the
respondent.
that
picket
line
was
maintained
by
them,
there
in
finding
11,
on
page
241,
gives
the
history
through
the
first
of
these
cases.
the
picketing
was
maintained
by
the
crew
from
september
9th
until
september
26,
after
that
others
asking
for
the
crew
members
and
they
were
never
fully
identified,
picketed
from
september
26
through
october
13th,
1952.
then
it
continues
that
the
members
of
the
crew
had
designated
the
sailors'
union
of
the
pacific
as
their
bargaining
agent.
on
october
14,
1952,
members
of
the
sailors'
union
of
the
pacific
commenced
picketing
said
vessel
and
continued
to
picket
it
until
restrained
and
enjoined.
now,
two
days
after
the
s.u.p.
was
restrained,
the
second
of
these
unions,
the
masters,
mates
and
pilots
took
up
the
picket
line
and
a
day
after
it
was
enjoined,
the
third
of
the
unions,
the
atlantic
and
gulf
district
of
the
seafarers
international
union
took
up
the
picket
line.
it
was
one
continuous
chain
of
picketing
broken
only
by
the
two
injunctions.
now,
the
purposes
for
which
that
picketing
was
being
conducted
are
found
in
this
finding
12
and
the
court,
district
court
did
find
the
sole
purpose
of
said
picketing
by
the
members
of
the
sailors'
union
of
the
pacific
was
to
compel
plaintiff
to
reemploy
the
said
discharged,
striking
members
of
the
crew
for
a
shorter
--
shorter
period
and
that's
stated
in
the
articles
and
of
wage
rates
and
other
conditions
more
favorable
to
--
to
them
than
stated
in
said
articles.(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
the
petitioner's
argument
on
that
point,
mr.
justice
brennan,
relies
on
the
--
the
case
of
weber
versus
anheuser-busch
and
other
cases
which
deal
with
the
question
of
the
national
labor
relations
board's
jurisdiction
to
enjoin.
that
is,
to
determine
and
stop
an
act
which
is
going
on.
here
we
have
a
case
of
damages
after
the
fact,
and
i
think
there
are
two
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
within
the
past
two
years
which
very
clearly
point
out
that
the
board
has
no
jurisdiction
in
these
damage
cases
at
all.
there
was
the
case
of
the
international
longshoremen's
&
warehousemen's
union
versus
juneau
spruce
company
where
a
substantial
judgment
had
been
entered
in
the
district
court
of
alaska
against
those
--
that
union
for
picketing
in
a
secondary
boycott.
the
issue
went
up
before
this
court
was
whether
that
it
was
first
necessary
that
a
determination
be
made
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
before
that
damage
action
could
be
brought.
and
this
court
held
that
it
was
entirely
unnecessary
that
the
action
for
damages
was
divorced
from
the
prohibition
or
injunction
proceeding
where
the
national
labor
relations
board
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
think
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
think
there
is
certainly
the
possibility
of
that
type
of
a
conflict.
in
the
juneau
spruce
case,
no
determination
had
been
made
one
way
or
the
other
by
the
board
but
the
court's
opinion
pointed
out
that
the
section
dealing
with
damages
for
--
which
is
303
of
the
act
was
entirely
separate
from
the
proceedings
under
--
i
think
it's
section
10
which
provides
the
injunctive
processes
of
the
board
and
held
that
unanimously
that
there
was
no
requirement
that
a
board
determination
or
finding
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
come
first.
and
then
in
the
laburnum
case
decided
by
this
court
where
it
was
--
there
--
there
was
conduct
which
was
a
tort
under
the
laws
of
the
state
where
it
was
committed
and
which
the
court
also
assumed
was
an
unfair
labor
practice,
this
court
held,
though
it
was
not
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
which
the
national
labor
management
relations
act
provided
any
remedy,
this
court
held
that
since
the
act
provided
no
remedy,
the
common-law
tort
remedy
was
still
available.
and
again,
there
was
no
requirement
in
that
case
that
a
determination
be
made
one
way
or
the
other,
but
although
it
was
assumed
that
it
was
an
unfair
labor
practice.
but
i
--
i
think
there
is
a
logical
reason
for
separating
damages
from
prohibition.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
all
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
believe
so,
and
--
and
that
is
certainly
the
position
we
are
taking
here.
there
was
no
violence
here
but
the
--
we
feel
that
under
the
--
and
it
was
held
it'd
be
under
the
law
of
oregon
that
this
picketing
constituted
a
tort.
we
feel
that
the
act
provides
no
remedy
to
the
respondent
and
that
the
common-law
remedy
is,
of
damages
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
act
and
should
be
allowed.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
well,
i
--
i
think
this
if
--
if
this
conduct,
this
picketing
is
protected
picketing
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
amended,
then
no
cause
of
action
would
lie.
that
act,
if
these
are
concerted
activities
which
are
protected
by
that
act,
then
that
is
a
substantive
defense.
but
i
don't
think
it
has
anything
to
do
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
that
would
be
a
question
which
the
court
would
determine
and
which
would
be
reviewable
by
higher
courts
including
this
one
as
to
whether
the
substantive
defense
was
that
this
was
protected
concerted
activities.
i
think
we
have
here
a
difference
in
whether
you're
in
proscription.
now,
it's
quite
important
that
you
don't
stop
a
strike
or
don't
stop
picketing,
inconsistently,
all
around
the
country
and
therefore,
it
makes
sense
to
give
initial
jurisdiction
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
to
determine
whether
something
is
going
to
be
enjoined.
but
here,
we're
dealing
solely
with
a
private
right.
someone
who
claims
damage
after
the
dispute
is
all
over
and
is
suing
for
that
damage
and
i
see
no
reason
why
the
various
courts
around
the
state,
the
country
cannot
consider
those
cases
and
have
the
substantive
questions
subject
only
to
review
by
higher
courts.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
he
may
--
he
may
not
have
a
judgment
in
damages
if
the
state
court
finds,
as
you
have
said,
that
it
was
protected
picketing
because
that
would
be
a
substantive
defense.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
that's
what
i
said.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
their
main
defense
as
it's
expressed
both
in
the
questions
here
and
below
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
they
alleged
defenses
under
the
claim
that
the
court
lacked
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
initially,
when
we
had
the
injunctive
part
of
the
case
is
in,
they
were
relying
on
the
national
--
on
the
norris-laguardia
act
as
well
as
on
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
amended
and
i
believe
ultimately,
it
boiled
down
to
a
position
and
certainly
in
this
court
the
position
is
that
the
national
labor
management
relations
act
deprived
the
court
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
that
has
been
something
that
has
never
been
clear
to
me.
i
assumed
that
they
were
trying
to
and
answered
it
in
my
brief
on
that
basis.
so,
they
have
always
expressed
it
not
as
a
substantive
defense
but
solely
as
this
question
of
jurisdiction
that
the
court
lacked
jurisdiction,
not
that
the
court
--
not
that
they
had
a
substantive
defense
to
the
action
which
was
brought.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
that
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
--
that
is
their
argument.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
well,
i
think
there's
a
difference,
your
honor,
between
claiming
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
provided
a
substantive
defense
and
preempted
state
policy
to
the
contrary
and
saying
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
jurisdictionally
preempted
the
field
and
gave
it
to
the
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
think
it's
the
latter
argument
they
have
made
rather
than
the
former
one.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
agree.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
well,
i
don't
think
they
have.
but
assuming
that
they
have
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
--
i
have
attempted
to
answer
it
in
the
brief
as
well
as
my
in
argument.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
the
answer
in
this
case
is
that
i
think
the
activity
was
not
protected
for
two
reasons.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
yes.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
yes.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
first
that
this,
is
a
dispute
basically
between
a
foreign
shipowner
and
a
foreign
crew
for
employment
aboard
a
foreign
vessel.
and
i
do
not
feel
that
it
was
the
intent
of
congress,
i
see
nothing
in
the
act
or
in
its
legislative
history
which
would
lead
us
to
the
conclusion
that
they
were
intending
to
legislate
for
the
employment
relations
of
foreign
seamen
aboard
foreign
ships
with
their
foreign
employers.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
there
was
the
case
--
i
don't
think
there
have
been
any
in
this
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
yes,
and
it
was
in
the
statutory
thing
--
well
it
was
the
jones
act,
i
believe
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
--
between
a
case
of
lauritzen
versus
larsen
which
mr.
justice
jackson
wrote
a
rather
lengthy
opinion.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
and
in
that
case,
it
--
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
universal
word,
"any
seamen",
words,
"any
seamen"
in
the
jones
act
weren't
intended
to
apply
to
any
seamen
in
the
world
but
only
to
those
which
would
normally
come
within
the
jurisdiction
and
legislative
intent
of
this
country.
and
they
held
there
that
a
foreign
seaman
injured
aboard
a
foreign
ship
in
foreign
waters
could
not
sue
under
the
jones
act,
just
because
he
and
the
ship
happen
at
some
later
time
both
be
in
a
united
states
port.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
here
you
have
domestic
waters
and
further
in
this
case
and
the
petitioners
make
a
point
of
it,
the
picketing
itself
was
on
american
soil
and
what
we
are
seeking
damages
for,
is
that
picketing.
but
i
think
to
decide
whether
that
picketing
is
protected,
you
must
look
at
its
purpose
and
its
purpose,
the
sole
purpose
found
by
the
district
court
was
to
force
the
rehire
by
a
foreign
employer,
aboard
a
foreign
ship
of
foreign
seamen
and
it's
that
foreign
purpose
that
i
think
takes
it
out
in
answering
the
question
of
mr.
justice
douglas
are
these
men
employees?
i
would
say,
"they
are
not
employees,"
because
foreign
employees
in
a
foreign
employment
situation
were
not
intended
to
be
covered
by
the
act.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
now,
there's
a
second
reason
and
that
relates
to
the
nature
of
the
dispute
which
started
here.
i
don't
think
that
sailors
aboard
a
ship
serving
under
article
are
under
the
same
working
situation
as
employees
ashore.
this
court
has
held
and
the
lower
federal
courts,
also,
that
where
you
have
a
crew
working
under
articles,
their
bargaining
situation
is
not
open
to
review
and
to
strike,
and
a
strike
constitutes
a
mutiny.
that
one
case
that
came
before
this
court
was
the
southern
shipping
case.
there,
the
crew
had
engaged
in
a
very
short
sitdown
strike
for
11
hours.
then,
they
resumed
their
employment.
at
the
end
of
the
voyage,
they
were
discharged.
the
national
labor
relations
board
held
that
that
discharge
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
that
the
employer
had
been
guilty
of
unfair
labor
practice
which
started
the
strike
in
the
first
place.
this
court
held
that
that
order
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
could
not
be
enforced
because
of
the
paramount
need
of
discipline
aboard
ships
and
you
have
this
problem.
that
seamen
must
obey
commands
if
you're
to
have
the
safety
of
lives
and
property
under
ships.
and
when
they
go
on
strike,
it
destroys
that
discipline.
another
lower
case,
the
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
that's
southern
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
steamship
company
versus
nlrb
was
decided,
i

mr.
john
d.
mosser
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
that
is
our
position,
your
honor.
as
pointed
out
in
another
peninsula
and
occidental
steamship
company
case
which
i
believe
in
the
fourth
circuit,
it's
in
the
brief.
the
court
pointed
out
under
very
similar
circumstances
to
the
case
that
i've
just
related
a
sitdown
strike
in
order
of
reinstatement
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
after
discharge
of
the
men,
that
if
that
owner
--
shipowner
took
back
any
from
this
crew,
he
would
be
rendering
his
vessel
unseaworthy
and
if
you're
going
to
force
an
order
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
according
to
the
general
admiralty
law
where
we
have
held
that
the
shipowner
is
liable
for
any
damage
which
occurs
--
where
he
has
--
certainly
where
he
has
knowledge
of
a
tendency
to
disobedience
on
the
part
of
the
crew
and
in
some
instances,
though
not
related
to
the
obedience
but
where
a
crew
member
does
something
which
a
man
of
the
ordinary
ability
in
the
trade
or
--
or
calling,
disposition
of
seamen
would
not
(inaudible)
even
though
the
owner
had
no
knowledge
of
it
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
--
reveal
that
liability.
yes.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
in
pope
&
talbot
versus
hawn,
i
think,
was
the
case
that
was
before
the
court.
so,
you
have
this
liability
and
duty
on
the
part
of
the
shipowner
to
get
rid
of
a
crew
which
is
mutinous
and
has
showed
that
tendency.
now,
here,
the
picketing
was
to
force
the
shipowner
to
take
that
crew
back
to
make
his
vessel
unseaworthy.
and
if
an
order
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
could
not
affect
that
purpose
as
was
held
in
the
southern
shipping
company
case,
why
should
individual
labor
unions
be
allowed
to
picket
for
it?
and
that
was
the
illegal
purpose
that
was
found
by
the
--
the
district
court.
i
think
you
can
all
see
as
far
as
this
foreign
situation
is
concerned,
that
if
--
if
everytime
a
ship
comes
into
this,
the
ports
of
the
united
state,
it
must
renegotiate
its
articles,
raise
or
lower
its
wage
scales,
change
its
working
conditions
according
to
our
standards
even
if
it
must
fall
pause
enough
to
select
a
collective
bargaining
agent
under
the
machinery
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
amended
that
there's
going
to
be
not
a
clearing
of
obstructions
to
commerce
and
its
free
flow
but
a
tremendous
hindrance
to
shipping
of
those
foreign
countries
and
quite
likely
a
retaliation
against
our
ships
in
their
ports.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
that
is
--
that
is
correct
in
two
respects,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
no
seamen
may
be
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
wages
must
be
paid
upon
demand.
wages
do.
that
is
one
requirement
and
the
other
is
that
if
any
advance
is
made
by
the
shipowner
that
is
wages
paid
before
earned,
it
does
not
count
and
the
shipowner
must
pay
it
again
upon
demand.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
this
was
a
sitdown
strike.
they
held
possession
of
the
ship
for
a
period
of
some
--
from
the
19th
of
--
from
the
9th
of
september,
i
believe,
it
was
until
the
23rd
or
4th
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
while
it
was
at
the
dock.
and
they
only
left
when
ordered
to
do
so
by
the
district
court.
now,
as
far
as
a
remedy
being
available
to
the
petitioner
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
there
were
injunctions
against
these
three
picket
line
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
well,
it
--
it
might
have
been
under
a
different
posture
of
the
case,
your
honor.
the
--
but
after
the
injunctions
were
issued,
the
petitioners
took
that
case
to
the
ninth
circuit.
the
ninth
circuit
felt
that
since
the
ship
had
departed,
the
cases
were
moot
and
ordered
them
tried
on
the
issue
of
damages
as
if
the
injunctions
had
never
been
issued.
now,
there
was
no
questions,
thereafter.
no
motion
for
jury
trial
for
example
was
made
on
the
remand
of
the
cases.
it
was
stipulated
that
they
be
tried
before
the
same
district
judge
and
heard
all
of
the
evidence
before
it.
they
were
not
discharged
by
court
order
if
you
mean
the
crew
members,
mr.
justice
douglas.
they
were
discharged,
i
would
say,
by
the
captain
when
he
ordered
them
to
work
or
to
get
off
the
ship
and
they
didn't
do
either.
and
then
he
said
that
you're
through.
get
off
the
ship
if
you
won't
work.
i
think
that
was
the
--
the
statement
that
would
have
discharged
the
crew
members
for
their
conduct
in
refusing
to
work.
there's
a
question
here
as
to
whether
the
act
affords
the
respondent
any
remedy
which
is
raised
by
the
petitioners.
they
claimed
that
this
was
secondary
picketing.
they
cite
no
authority
in
support
of
that.
in
fact,
the
one
case
they
do
cite
says
picketing
in
a
situation
like
this
is
primary
since
the
ship
is
a
transitory
site
as
of
the
shipowner.
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
we
have
here
suits
against
individuals,
not
against
the
labor
organizations.
that
is,
the
judgments
which
are
now
in
effect
as
modified
by
the
court
of
appeals
run
only
against
the
individuals.
and
while
a
secondary
boycott
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
the
act,
the
act
only
provides
a
remedy
against
labor
organizations.
it
provides
no
remedy
against
individuals.
it
merely
says
that
any
person
who
is
injured
by
a
secondary
boycott
may
bring
an
action
for
damages.
that
if
he
does
and
its
against
an
organization,
then
the
judgment
shall
be
in
such
and
such
a
form
and
enforceable
in
a
certain
way.
but
it
says
nothing
at
all
about
suits
against
individuals
and
it
is
certainly
permissive
even
as
to
the
right
to
bring
that
type
of
suit
against
organizations.
there
have
been
lower
federal
court
cases
holding
that
the
organizations
themselves
may
still
be
sued
by
other
procedures.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
we
did
cross
petition
--
yes
mr.
justice
--
mr.
john
d.
mosser
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
mosser
no
your
honor.
that
the
only
thing
i
was
pointing
out
is
that
they
claim
that
the
act
provides
a
remedy
and
that
we
used
the
common-law
remedy
for
damages
instead
of
a
remedy
for
damages
under
the
act.
and
that
i
do
not
feel
that
that
is
true.
there
is
no
remedy
afforded
to
us
under
the
act
in
this
situation.
we
feel
that
the
judgments
to
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed
insofar
as
they
affirmed
the
judgments
of
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
oregon.
