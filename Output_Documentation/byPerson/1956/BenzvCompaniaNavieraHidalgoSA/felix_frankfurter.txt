justice
felix
frankfurter
would
that
permit
the
national
labor
relations
board
to
hold
that
in
picketing
as
they
did
or
as
workers
do,
they
are
within
their
protected
right
and
yet
you
could
sue
that
get
damages
in
the
state
court?
with
that
which
the
labor
board
said
it
was
all
right
so
as
to
preclude
an
injunction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
between
that
kind
of
a
--
that
kind
of
a
conflict,
could
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understood
--
i
got
the
impression
from
what
you've
said
in
reply
to
--
your
reply
to
an
earlier
question
in
the
series
of
questions
put
to
you
just
now
by
justice
brennan.
i
got
the
impression
that
you
said
that
if
damages
were
sought
for,
sued
apart,
that
then
the
defendant
in
that
damage
suit
could
say,
"oh,
but
what
we
did
wasn't
a
tort,
couldn't
be
made
a
tort
by
state
law
because
it
has
the
statute
--
it
has
the
permission
of
the
united
states
clause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
you
said?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
then,
the
matter
gets
down
to
the
fact
that
in
this
case
--
what
was
the
defense
in
this
case
when
suit
was
brought?
they
didn't
lie
down
and
say,
"aye
--
start
the
day."
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
was
the
defense
in
the
pleading?
when
the
suit
was
filed
for
damages,
what
was
the
answer
or
whatever
it's
called
in
oregon?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is,
in
view
of
your
answer
a
little
while
ago,
namely,
that
they
could
invoke
the
defense
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
i
want
to
know
did
they
in
this
suit
on
damages,
not
what
the
argument
is
here.
did
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
the
wat
--
it
lacked
jurisdiction
because
this
is
a
matter
that
can't
get
into
courts
--
in
any
court
ab
initio
it
must
first
go
to
the
labor
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
isn't
that
raising
the
claim
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
preempted
this
field
and
the
state
can,
on
its
own,
say
something
as
a
tort
which
may
be
sanctioned
by
a
federal
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
--
if
this
is
a
matter
for
the
national
labor
relations
act
or
rather
if
it's
open.
if
it
has
to
go
there,
then
the
court
is
without
jurisdiction
because
you
can't
begin
a
suit
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
under
the
--
under
a
violation
as
to
which
there
must
be
a
finding
by
the
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
why
haven't
they
invoked
the
defense
that
although
this
is
a
damage
suit,
oregon
can't
give
a
right
and
(inaudible)
that
the
federal
act
is
taking
away
that
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
answer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
a
matter
of
law
you
are
say
you
don't
have
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
get
the
board
to
pass
on
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
what
is
--
what
are
reasons?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
case
did
we
--
we
had
a
case
involving
that
problem
of
the
extent
to
which
the
federal
act
is
applicable
to
a
foreign
ship
and
a
foreign
crew.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
under
the
labor
act,
but
under
another
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
jones
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i'm
referring
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
here
you
have
domestic
waters.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
we
really
have
in
this
case
you
(inaudible)
the
argument,
i
think
so
you
raised
it.
but
in
the
first
place,
the
applicability
of
national
labor
relations
act
to
--
happening
to
be
sure
on
this
--
in
american
borders
but
relating
wholly
to
--
to
a
foreign
ship,
the
foreign
flag,
nationals,
entirely
consisting
of
nationals.
it's
not
an
american
citizen
involved,
relating
to
conditions
of
employment
in
a
ship
that
is
here
just
in
transient.
(a)
that
--
in
that
particular
situation
that
the
act
apply.
and
you
say
that
in
any
event
and
it
is
clear,
isn't
it,
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
does
apply
to
american
--
to
the
industrial
relations
between
ship
and
--
and
american
seamen
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
but
southern
steamship
company
case
showed
that
even
--
that
has
to
be
qualified
to
further
secure
the
relations
of
a
ship
to
its
men
or
vise
versa.
justice
felix
frankfurter
according
--
according
to
general
admiralty
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
called
that
very
recently?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
mosser,
the
(inaudible)
act
at
least
either
in
whole
in
part
does
apply
to
articling
of
foreign
ships
here,
does
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
allowances
and
deductions
of
wages
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this,
--
was
there
an
injunction
we
had
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
plainly
a
case
of
a
norris-laguardia,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
not
--
you
didn't
cross
--
cross
petition
here,
did
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
you'd
be
force
under
cross
petition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
that
question
about
the
--
the
union
viability
isn't
here,
is
it?
