justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
tanner,
may
i
ask
before
you
get
to
that,
are
--
are
you
suggesting
that
the
finding
in
12
at
page
242
is
without
support
in
the
record
as
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
you
asking
this
court
to
disregard
this
finding
on
the
ground
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
what
your
position
is.are
you
asking
us
not
to
accept
this
finding
on
the
ground
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
not
supported
on
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
but
the
fact
is
--
they
have
facts
to
fact,
and
we
have
to
proceed
to
the
decision
of
the
issues
here,
accepting
the
finding
here,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask,
mr.
tanner,
was
this
--
that
word
"sole"
was
that
attacked
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
it
the
posture
of
the
case
here
that
as
to
this
fact
--
finding
of
fact
in
any
event,
both
lower
courts
acted
upon
it.
rightly
or
wrongly
is
another
question
for
this,
to
this
finding
that
not
both
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
tanner,
can
we
get
at
it
in
terms
of
this
finding
12.
i
gather
that
these
sailors
accepting
this
finding
as
found
on
the
riviera
had
signed
on
somewhere
under
given
articles
which
had
a
specific
duration
and
with
certain
terms
and
conditions
of
a
plaintiff,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
this
--
this
finding
is
that
the
sailors'
union
of
the
pacific
picketed
in
order
to
compel
the
respondent
shipowner
to
modify
those
articles
to
fix
a
shorter
period
than
they
provided
and
that
wage
rates
and
other
conditions
different
from
those
under
the
articles,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
and
your
--
and
your
position
is
that
whether
or
not,
that
was
proper
picketing,
that
is
that
purpose
was
something
for
which
the
sailors'
union
of
the
pacific
could
properly
picket
was
an
issue
for
determination
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
exclusively.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
tanner,
aren't
you
up
against
the
difficulty
that
here
is
a
finding
that
they
were
discharged
at
the
time
that
you
did
this
picketing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
can't
go
behind
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
why
do
you
say
that,
that
purpose
would
not
be
something
for
a
determination
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
either
as
to
prohibition
or
as
to
permits
of
picket?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
are
suggesting
that
laburnum
would
have
been
decided
as
it
was
but
for
--
even
without
the
facts
as
to
violence
who
would
like
to
do
the
picketing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
justice
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter
just
suggested
the
peaceful
picketing
which
is
what
we
have
here
was
found
lawful
by
the
board
if
it's
properly
a
case
for
the
board.
and
nevertheless,
would
suggest
that
there
would
be
an
action
of
damages
--
in
damages
maintainable
for
the
--
what
happened
to
this
respondent
as
a
result
of
the
pickets?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
does
--
doesn't
that
suggest
that
everytime
that
it
was
protected
peaceful
picketing
of
any
employer
if
the
state
allows
an
action
in
tort
based
upon
damages
suffered
from
the
picketing,
even
though
it's
protected
picketing,
nevertheless,
the
employer
may
have
a
judgment
in
damages.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
state
court
doesn't
know
anything
about
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
whether
it's
protected
or
not.
