mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
involved
here
in
determining
the
liability
of
the
surety
under
a
bond
given
to
the
--
pursuant
to
the
miller
act
and
i
think
at
the
outset,
it
is
well
to
look
to
the
exact
term
of
the
bond
which
the
surety
gave
in
this
case.
the
bond
itself
provided
that
the
condition
of
the
obligation
is
such
--
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
i'm
reading
from
the
transcript,
page
18
and
19.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
the
condition
of
this
obligation
is
such
that
whereas
the
principle
entered
into
a
certain
contract
with
the
government
numbered
and
dated
as
shown
above
and
heard
to
attest.
now,
therefore,
if
the
principle
shall
promptly
make
payment
to
all
persons
supplying
labor
and
material
in
the
prosecution
of
the
work
provided
for
in
said
contract,
then
the
obligation
to
be
void.
the
contract
itself,
it
was
stipulated
on
page
--
as
set
forth
on
page
13
of
the
transcript,
provided
with
reference
to
the
payment
for
labor
that
the
contract
shall
pay
all
mechanics
and
laborers
employed
directly
upon
the
site
of
the
work,
unconditionally
and
not
less
often
than
once
a
week,
and
without
subsequent
deduction
or
rebate
on
any
account,
except
such
payroll
deductions
as
are
permitted
by
applicable
regulations
prescribed
by
the
secretary
of
labor,
the
full
amounts
accrued
at
the
time
of
payment,
computed
at
wage
rates
not
less
than
those
stated
in
the
specifications
regardless
of
any
contractual
relationship
which
may
be
alleged
to
exist
between
the
contractor
or
subcontractor
in
such
laborers
and
--
or
mechanics.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
trustee
and
bankruptcy
is
not
a
party
to
the
action,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
he
was
not
joined,
although
the
--
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
we
have
only
the
surety
involved
here.
although,
at
the
outset,
the
action
was
filed
against
the
contractor
even
though
i
believe
at
the
time
the
action
was
filed,
the
contractor
was
in
bankruptcy.
he
has
joined
as
a
party
but
involved
here
is
only
the
surety.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
it
--
both
problems
are
involved.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
yes,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
the
miller
act
itself
provides
that
the
--
a
bond
shall
be
furnished
to
protect
persons
performing
labor
in
connection
with
the
government
contracts.
and
the
cases
that
we
have
cited
indicate
that
that
is
a
strict
requirement.
in
other
words,
the
person
who
is
protected
under
the
miller
act
is
the
laborer
or
material
man,
the
person
who
performs
work
--
connected
with
the
government
contract.
now,
that's
further
backed
up
under
the
davis-bacon
act
which
is
conceded
to
be
written
in
because
if
payment
is
not
made
and
the
--
and
amounts
are
withheld
from
the
contract
price,
the
laborer
may
apply
to
the
comptroller
general
to
pay
him
his
unpaid
wages
and
they
used
the
term
“wages”
so
that
the
person
who
is
entitled
to
sue
is
an
issue
in
this
action.
and
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
briefs,
by
no
stretch
of
the
imagination
can
the
trustees
of
a
health
and
welfare
fund
redeem
to
be
persons
who
performed
labor
in
connection
with
the
government
contract?
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
now
--
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
the
answer
to
the
first
question
is
that
if
the
trustees
are
not
suing
on
behalf
of
or
as
a
class
suit,
they
are
simply
suing
here
as
trustees
of
a
health
and
welfare
fund.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
yes,
there
would
be
a
difference,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
yes,
because
first
of
all,
it
would
be
in
my
reading
of
the
trust
agreement,
"no
right
in
the
individual
laborer
to
bring
such
an
action
for
unpaid
employer
contributions,
which
are
the
subject
of
this
suit."
in
other
words,
the
trust
agreement
itself
specifically
provides
that
the
individual
employee
has
no
right,
title
or
interest
in
any
of
the
contributions.
it
specifically
provides
in
the
trust
agreement
itself
that
these
contributions
are
not
wages.
it
specifically
provides
that
the
contributions
are
not
part
of
wages,
and
furthermore,
that
the
only
right
that
the
individual
employee
may
have
is
in
any
--
the
benefits
of
any
insurance
purchased
with
the
contributions
so
that
the
individual
employee,
i
cannot
see,
would
have
any
standing
to
sue
for
the
unpaid
contribution,
if
it
were
not
made.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
and
under
the
miller
act,
his
right
would
be
to
wages
which
were
not
paid
to
him.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
the
trustees
of
the
health
and
welfare
fund
very
definitely
have
the
right
to
sue
the
contractor.
there
is
a
debtor-creditor
relationship
between
them
and
the
--
or
a
contractual
obligation
between
the
contractor
and
the
health
and
welfare
fund.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
it
does
not
apply
to
this
agreement
and
i
think
the
--
the
terms
of
the
fund
and
the
construction
contract
argue
that
very
persuasively.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
the
agreement
--
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
no,
there
--
there
were
two
agreements.
there
was
a
collective-bargaining
agreement
between
the
association
of
employers
--
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
--
and
a
collective
--
and
the
union.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
it
--
it
provided
that
they
would
set
up
a
fund
in
the
future
as
a
matter
of
interest.
the
fund
was
actually
set
up
after
the
bond
and
the
construction
contract
were
entered
into
some
several
months
thereafter.
and
the
obligation
then
was
for
the
members
of
the
employer
group
to
pay
into
the
fund
at
the
rate
of
7
1/2
cents
per
hour
for
each
hour
worked
by
employees.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
carter
was
the
employer.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
well,
only
through
his
employer
group.
it
was
not
an
individual
contract.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
it
was
an
industry-wide
contract.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
no,
for
the
purpose
of
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
we
assumed
that
he
--
that
there
was
authority
to
bind
him
--
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
--
to
make
the
payment.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
yes.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
yes.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
yes,
the
bond
must
be
given
to
provide
that
people
or
persons
who
have
furnished
labor
as
provided
in
the
construction
agreement
will
be
paid
in
full.
and
it
is
our
contention
that
under
the
expressed
wording
of
the
construction
contract,
the
full
amount
of
the
wages
provided
by
that
contract
has
been
paid
and
it
was
so
--
it
is
so
conceited
by
the
petitioners.
we
have
paid
or
carter
paid
these
employees
their
wages
in
full
without
deduction.
no,
there
is
nothing
unpaid
under
the
construction
contract
to
any
laborer.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
yes.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
i
think
that
the
answer
to
that
is
two-fold.
i
think
that
the
--
that
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
which
has
set
forth
generally
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
employment
in
the
industry
certainly
binds
the
employer
to
that
if
he
is
a
signatory
to
the
agreement.
but
that
does
not
--
you
can't
jump
from
that
immediately
to
say
that
then
the
surety
on
the
miller
act
bond
guarantees
full
performance
of
that
collective-bargaining
agreement.
it
will
--
it
ensures
that
the
employer
will
perform
those
parts
of
the
agreement
which
he's
agreed
within
the
construction
contract
to
pay,
namely,
the
wages
at
the
rate
prescribed
by
the
secretary
of
labor.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
the
trust
agreement
itself
provides
that,
that
the
trustees
are
the
persons
who
may
sue
to
enforce
the
counter
payment
and
the
contribution.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
by
virtue
of
the
contract
obligation.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
no,
not
necessarily.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
the
contribution
--
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
it's
for
the
welfare
of
--
of
the
employees
in
the
industry
as
a
whole.
and
i
--
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
the
contribution
was
measured
by
the
hours
of
labor.
that
was
a
yardstick,
and
i
think
the
petitioners
must
concede
that
it
had
to
be
a
yardstick
only
as
a
convenient
means
of
measuring
what
the
contribution
of
the
employer
would
be
to
the
welfare
fund.
now,
it
could
have
been
any
other
yardstick.
it
could
have
been
a
flat
sum
or
employer.
it
could
have
been
a
flat
sum
per
employee
but
it
was
not.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
it
--
it
was
measured
by
the
labor,
yes.
and
it
was
to
provide
a
welfare
fund
for
all
laborers.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
not
necessarily
because
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
these
men
working
in
the
industry
might
not
receive
ultimately
any
--
any
benefit
from
these
contributions.
in
other
words,
unless
they
worked
for
400
hours
in
the
employment,
they
would
not
be
entitled
to
any
benefits
under
the
health
and
welfare
plan.
so
that
the
--
while
the
contribution
required
to
be
made
into
the
fund
might
have
been
measured
by
the
hours
worked.
there
was
no
direct
benefit
to
the
employee
and
i
--
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
no,
not
necessarily.
no,
this
is
not
a
work
for
workmen's
compensation
act.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
if
they
had
complied
with
the
rules
of
the
trustee
that
they
had
worked
for
six
months
and
had
contributed
400
hours.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
now
--
and
interestingly
enough,
those
rules
are
set
up
by
the
trustees.
they're
not
prescribed
by
the
trust
agreement.
in
other
words,
those
rules
were
subject
to
change
at
the
whim
of
the
trustees.
so
that
while
a
trust
fund
was
--
was
set
up
here
and
contributions
were
being
made
into
the
fund,
the
amount
that
the
labor
might
receive
back
was
a
very
nebulous
thing.
it
governs
somewhat
at
the
whim,
i
would
say,
in
reading
the
agreement
of
the
trustees
and
the
rules
they
might
set
up.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
no
question
with
that.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
that
would
be
the
same.
of
course,
the
same
reasoning
that
we
have
in
the
workmen's
compensation
act.
in
other
words,
the
--
the
protection
of
a
workman's
compensation
policy
is
a
condition
of
employment.
that
is
a
protection
to
the
employee.
and
yet,
the
surety
under
a
miller
act
bond
is
not
liable
for
the
payment
of
a
--
of
a
workmen's
compensation
premium
under
the
cases
that
we
have
cited.
now,
i
mean
--
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
there
is
a
limited
obligation
of
the
surety
regardless
of
the
fact
that
all
of
these
matters
may
have
been
--
be
of
indirect
benefit
to
the
employee.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
i
do
not
know
that,
your
honor,
for
the
purposes
of
this
motion.
we
assume
that
the
--
number
one,
the
employer
was
bound
by
the
agreements
and
number
two,
did
not
concern
ourselves
with
whether
or
not
the
persons
--
the
employees
were
required
to
proceed
through
the
union.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
so
we
have
no
issue
of
that
here.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
no,
we
do
not.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
the
only
allegations
are
that
there
was
a
basic
collective-bargaining
agreement
which
--
by
virtue
of
which
the
trust
agreement
was
entered
into.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
no.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
i'll
let
mr.
stanton
answer
that
question.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
now,
i
think
some
issue
has
been
made
of
the
fact
that
these
payments
may
have
constituted
wages
or
into
the
--
or
consideration
for
labor.
i
think
the
--
actually,
the
agreement
itself
provides
otherwise
and
it
very
carefully
provides
otherwise.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
petitioners
had
conceded
that
in
their
brief
that
they
had
to
very
carefully
provide
that
the
employer
contributions
would
not
be
deemed
to
be
wages
because
of
the
difficulties
they
would
run
into
under
the
california
labor
code
and
into
california
insurance
code
and
the
anti-kickback
law.
now
--
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
the
consideration
--
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
it
is
--
it
may
be
a
consideration
for
--
or
part
of
the
consideration
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement.but
is
it
related
to
this
particular
job?
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
on
this
particular
government
contract.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
the
contribution,
yes.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
the
contribution
is
based
on
the
hours
worked
by
the
employee.
but
again,
the
--
if
any
contribution
or
if
any
benefit
be
received
by
the
employee,
it
has
no
relation
to
the
government
job
on
which
he
may
have
worked
here.
his
eligibility
is
determined
by
the
rules
of
the
trustee
which
at
this
time
i
happened
to
be
that
he
worked
for
400
hours.
if
he
worked
for
399
hours,
he
had
no
--
no
right
in
the
fund.
now
--
but
assuming
--
assuming
without
conceding
that
this
was
consideration
for
labor
were
somewhat
in
the
position
of
the
cases
involved
in
the
withholding
taxes
where
there
were
actual
deductions
from
wages
which
the
contractor
did
not
in
turn
pay
over
the
government.
now,
the
courts
there
held
that
the
test
was
whether
or
not
--
had
the
employer
--
employee
himself
had
been
pay
it
in
full.
that
was
the
ultimate
test
had
the
employee
himself
had
been
paid
in
full.
if
he
had,
the
condition
of
the
miller
act
had
been
satisfied
and
the
surety
was
not
liable
for
the
contributions
or
the
deductions
from
wages
which
the
contractor
has
not
paid
over
into
the
government.
now,
we
have
here
a
marked
forceful
example
of
that
where
the
--
no
deduction
was
made
from
the
employee's
wage.
he
--
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
those
are
the
cases
cited
in
our
brief
relating
to
the
--
there
is
a
whole
series
of
circuit
court
cases
covering
that,
united
states
against
crossland,
pages
21
and
22
of
our
brief.
i
think
the
us
against
crossland
is
perhaps
the
best
reason
of
the
cases.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
u.s.
fmg
against
united
states.
in
other
words,
the
court
there
points
out,
assuming
that
these
were
wages,
the
condition
of
the
miller
act
bond
as
--
has
the
employee
himself
been
paid
in
full.
and
if
he
has,
then
the
surety
is
not
liable
because
there
are
many
debtor-creditor
relationship
between
the
contract
--
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
it
was
part
of
wages,
and
yet,
the
surety
was
held
not
liable
to
the
government
for
the
--
if
the
contractor
didn't
pay
that.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
i
think
under
the
strict
reasoning
of
these
cases,
it
would
not.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
however,
because
the
condition
is
that
the
employee
be
paid
in
full.
now,
in
this
case,
once
the
employee
was
paid
his
wages
in
full,
then
whatever
rights
he
had
under
the
welfare
fund,
he
was
entitled
to
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
contribution
was
ultimately
made
by
the
employer.
so
that
in
your
case,
if
he
received
credit
for
that
$50
or
$10
per
week
into
the
fund
--
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
went
into
a
bank
directly
for
his
benefit
in
which
he
had
an
interest.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
if
he
had
a
direct
financial
interest
in
the
$10,
certainly,
he
would
be
--
or
the
protection
of
the
bond
would
be
afforded.
if
however,
it's
in
our
case
--
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
there
wouldn't
--
there'd
be
no
question,
i
don't
think
in
that
case.
but
here,
we
don't
--
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
i
think
he
could
sue
if
he
had
a
vested
interest
in
that
$10.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
but
we
--
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
yes.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
the
difference
here
is
that
in
the
case
we
have
at
the
present
case,
he
has
no
vested
interest
in
the
$10.
he
has
no
right
to
sue
for
the
$10.
he
agrees.
now,
he
can't
sue
for
the
$10.
he
has
no
right,
title
or
interest
in
the
$10.
and
whereas
i
think
in
the
case
that
you
posed,
the
money
would
be
held
expressly
in
trust
for
him.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
for
him
and
his
family.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
but
that
is
an
entirely
different
--
it's
an
entirely
different
state
of
facts
than
there
are
present
here.
and
further
than
that,
the
--
in
the
present
case,
his
entitlement
to
benefits
is
not
measured
by
the
amount
of
the
employer's
contributions
but
by
the
number
of
hours
worked,
whether
or
not
he
complies
with
the
requirements
that
are
set
up
by
the
trustees
of
the
fund.
he
has
no
vested
interest
in
the
--
or
no
interest
at
all
in
those
contributions.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
no.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
no.
not
--
absolutely
no
interest.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
because
the
trust
agreement
so
provides.
he
absolutely
has
no
--
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
he's
interested
--
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
he
is
interested
to
the
extent
that
provided,
he
comply
with
the
requirements
and
rules
set
up
by
the
trustees.
he
may
then
participate
in
certain
benefits
but
he
has
no
interest
in
the
moneys
that
are
contributed
into
the
fund.
mr.
richard
c.
dinkelspiel
that's
about
it
realistically.
thank
you,
your
honors.
