mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
if
the
court
please.
this
case
presents
the
question
as
to
whether
the
trustees
of
a
collectively
bargained
multi-employer
health
and
welfare
trust
funds
have
the
right
to
collect
under
a
miller
act
payment
bond,
contributions
which
a
federal
public
works
contractor
agreed
in
a
collective-bargaining
agreement
to
make
into
the
fund.
it
comes
to
this
court
by
certiorari
after
a
summary
judgment
was
entered
in
the
district
court
against
the
trustees
and
in
favor
of
the
surety
and
after
that
judgment
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
each
of
the
courts
below
held
that
petitioners
do
not
have
the
right
to
recover
because
it
would
be
necessary
in
order
to
give
that
right
to
use
the
words
of
the
district
court
to
stretch
the
terms
of
the
statute
far
beyond
the
limits
of
its
objectives
and
purposes.
i
think
then
to
present
this
matter
to
the
court,
i
should
start
with
the
language
of
the
statute,
the
pertinent
portion
of
it,
which
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
our
opening
brief.
by
that
statute
which
is
entitled
an
act
for
the
protection
of
persons
furnishing
material
and
labor,
for
the
construction,
alteration
or
repair
of
said
public
buildings
or
public
work,
section
1
(a)
(2)
provides
that
the
contractor
for
public
work
having
a
value
of
$2000
or
more
shall
provide
a
payment
bond
with
a
surety
or
sureties
satisfactory
to
such
officer
for
the
protection
of
all
persons
supplying
labor
and
material
in
the
prosecution
of
the
work
provided
for
in
the
said
contract
for
the
use
of
each
such
person.
section
2
(a)
of
the
act
provides
in
pertinent
part,
"every
person
who
has
furnished
labor
or
material
in
the
prosecution
of
the
work
provided
for
in
such
contract
in
respect
to
which
a
payment
bond
is
furnished
under
this
act
and
who
has
not
been
paid
in
full
therefore,
before
the
expiration
of
a
period
of
90
days
after
the
day
on
which
the
last
of
the
labor
was
done
or
performed
by
him
or
material
was
furnished
or
supplied
by
him
for
which
such
claim
is
made,
shall
have
the
right
to
sue
on
such
payment
bond
for
the
amount
or
the
balance
thereof
unpaid
at
the
time
of
institution
of
such
suit
and
to
prosecute
said
action
to
final
execution
and
judgment
for
the
sum
or
sums
justly
due
him."
the
courts
below
have
emphasized
certain
of
the
literal
language
of
that
statute.
we
wish
to
present
to
the
court
the
contentions
that
in
order
to
meet
the
literal
words
of
the
statute,
it
is
necessary
to
hold
that
we
as
trustees
for
the
laborers
are
entitled
to
recover.
i
emphasize
the
language
that
the
bond
is
for
the
protection
of
those
who
have
furnished
labor.
as
i
will
develop
in
my
argument,
contributions
for
which
we
sue
are
a
part
of
the
consideration
agreed
to
be
paid
for
the
labor
of
the
laborers
who
are
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
this
fund.
and
that
in
order
to
give
them
the
protection
that
they
are
entitled
under
the
statute,
it
is
necessary
to
hold
that
these
contributions
are
within
the
coverage
of
the
payment
bond.
i
point
further
to
the
language
of
the
second
section
which
says,
"gives
the
right
of
action
to
anyone
who
has
furnished
labor
and
who
has
not
been
paid
in
full
therefore."
and
i
emphasize
to
the
court
that
because
of
the
nature
of
these
contributions,
as
a
part
of
the
consideration
for
the
labor
being
performed
by
the
laborers
on
these
public
projects,
the
laborer
has
not
been
paid
in
full,
unless
the
court
recognizes
that
the
trustees
or
the
laborer,
who
are
the
petitioners
in
this
action,
are
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
bond
and
the
security
of
the
bond
for
the
payment
of
the
portion
of
the
laborer's
consideration
which
has
agreed
--
in
which
the
contractor
agreed
to
pay
into
the
fund.
now,
in
pointing
out
to
the
court
--
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
yes.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
yes,
i
am,
your
honor.
the
suit
is
brought
--
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
yes,
i
will
turn
to
that
immediately,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
well,
that
--
in
--
in
the
logical
course
of
my
argument
just
this
day,
i'll
reach
that.
this
trust
agreement
which
is
exhibit
c
to
the
statement
of
facts
on
which
--
which
appears
at
page
21
of
the
record
is
a
pamphlet.
it's
entitled
a
trust
agreement
for
the
laborers'
health
and
welfare
trust
fund
for
northern
california.
it
is
dated
march
4th,
1953
and
it
is
between
two
chapters
of
the
associated
general
contractors
of
america
as
employers
in
the
northern
california
district
council
of
hod
carriers,
building
and
construction
laborers
of
the
international
hod
carriers,
building
and
common
laborers'
union
of
america.
it
recites
--
recites
the
existence
of
certain
collective-bargaining
agreements
between
the
employers
and
the
union.
those
--
the
existence
of
those
collective-bargaining
agreements
is
likewise
alleged
in
the
complaint
and
admitted
on
the
stipulation
on
which
the
summary
judgment
was
entered.
on
page
2
of
the
document,
the
collective-bargaining
agreements
are
further
identified
as
being
master
agreements
between
the
two
agency
chapters
and
the
union
which
is
the
district
council
of
laborers.
and
at
the
end
of
the
agreement,
i
further
point
out
that
those
collective-bargaining
agreements
are
identified
as
46
northern
california
counties
collective-bargaining
agreements.
and
the
significance
of
that
is
that
the
agreements
cover
the
entire
46
counties
of
northern
california,
an
area
which
is
in
excess
in
size
of
the
entire
new
england
states
and
one-half
of
the
state
of
new
york,
an
area
which
stretches
400
miles
from
the
oregon
border
to
the
northern
border
of
kern
county.
the
signatories
to
that
agreement
on
behalf
of
the
union
is
a
northern
california
district
council.
that
council
is
a
council
of
individual
labor
unions
which
have
territorial
jurisdiction
within
the
46
counties,
which
have
bonded
themselves
together
for
the
purpose
of
dealing
with
the
construction
contractors.
the
signatories
for
the
employer
are
the
northern
california
chapter
of
the
associated
general
contractors
of
america
and
the
central
california
chapter,
the
associated
general
contractors
of
america.
those
are
associations
of
general
contractors
who
have
territorial
jurisdiction
corresponding
to
the
territorial
jurisdiction
of
the
laborers'
district
council.
in
other
words,
their
jurisdiction
for
the
employers
stands
over
the
46
counties
in
northern
california.
their
membership
is
approximately
500
general
contractors.
they
performed
by
far
the
greater
portion
of
the
construction
work
that
is
performed
in
the
northern
counties
of
california
and
probably,
with
few
if
any
exceptions,
perform
all
of
the
major
public
work.
and
they
employ
in
doing
that
work,
the
vast
majority
of
the
laborers
who
are
covered
by
the
collective-bargaining
agreements.
your
honors
will
note
on
page
21
of
this
pamphlet
that
there
is
a
list
of
signatory
associations
which
identified
by
the
names
that
they
used,
appear
to
be
general
contractors
associations
and
builder
--
builder
associations,
which
have
membership
throughout
the
46
counties
and
who
signed
the
collective-bargaining
agreements,
as
well
as
signing
this
trust
agreement.
they
bring
in
within
the
scope
of
the
collective-bargaining
unit
approximately
a
thousand
or
more
contractors.
and
then
in
the
process
of
collective
bargaining
in
this
area,
the
laborers'
district
council
makes
individual
agreements
which
are
referred
to
in
article
9
of
this
trust
agreement
on
page
19,
whereby
they
affiliate
with
this
bargaining
unit
individual
contractors
who
are
not
members
of
the
association
by
securing
by
--
of
any
of
the
signatory
associations,
by
securing
the
individual
signatures
of
the
contractors
to
what
are
designated
memorandum
agreements.
they
adopt
for
laborers
employed
by
those
contractors,
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
master
agreement
that
is
referred
to
in
the
trust
agreement.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
as
appears
from
the
complaint,
it
is
pled
that
carter
was,
at
the
time
of
the
work
that
was
performed,
a
member
of
the
home
builders
association
of
sacramento.
the
associated
home
builders
of
sacramento
--
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
i'm
sorry?
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
i'm
reading
from
the
page
21
of
the
pamphlet,
your
honor,
and
i
will
get
the
reference
in
the
transcript
to
the
allegation
but
i
simply
direct
the
attention
of
the
court
at
this
point
to
the
fact
that
the
associated
general
contract
--
i
mean,
home
builders
of
sacramento
appear
as
a
signatory
association
to
the
trust
agreement.
one,
two,
three,
four
names
down
on
the
left-hand
side
on
page
21
and
the
allegation
concerning
the
contractor's
affiliation
is
at
page
7
of
the
transcript
where
we
allege
that
the
associated
home
builders
of
sacramento
of
which
defendant,
donald
g.
carter,
was
at
all
times
--
at
all
relevant
times
a
member
in
good
standing,
signed
said
trust
agreement
and
ratify
and
improved
one
of
said
collective-bargaining
agreements
for
and
on
behalf
of,
and
as
the
agent
for
the
members
of
said
association
including
defendant,
donald
g.
carter,
doing
businesses
for
the
construction
company.
in
other
words,
he
was
bound
by
virtue
of
his
membership
in
an
association
which
is
a
signatory
association
not
only
to
the
trust
agreement
but
also
to
a
collective-bargaining
agreement
which
provided
for
the
establishment
of
the
trust
and
which
provided
for
the
payments
into
the
trust.
and
it
is
the
obligation
of
carter
under
that
action
on
the
part
of
his
association
binding
into
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
that
furnishes
the
basis
for
the
suit
that
is
--
has
been
filed
by
the
trustees.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
simply
by
his
membership,
the
bylaws
of
some
of
the
associations
provide
for
--
give
expressed
authority
to
the
association
to
represent
it
in
collective
bargaining.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
i
can't
state
to
the
court
that
that
is
the
fact,
your
honor,
because
we
have
alleged
the
authority.
we
are
prepared
to
prove
it
by
practice
and
by
the
representatives
who
sat
in
on
the
negotiations.
that
we
can
prove
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreements.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
we
depend
upon
our
allegation
and
the
fact
that
for
the
purposes
of
the
summary
judgment,
it
was
admitted
by
the
surety
and
no
issue
--
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
section
3.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
as
explained
in
the
brief,
the
reason
for
that
provision
was
to
avoid
a
holding
--
shall
i
read
it,
your
honor
or
--
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
the
--
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
yes.
the
provision
is
that
contributions
of
the
fund
shall
not
constitute
or
be
deemed
to
be
wages
due
to
the
employees
with
respect
to
whose
work
such
payments
are
made.
and
i
want
to
emphasize
"with
respect
to
whose
work
such
payments
are
made"
because
that
is
significant.
we
were
not
saying
that
they
are
not
to
be
considered
wages
in
a
general
sense.
we
were
saying
that
they
were
not
to
be
deemed
wages
due
to
the
individual
whose
work
was
involved
and
no
employee
shall
be
entitled
to
receive
any
part
of
the
contributions
made
or
required
to
be
made
to
the
fund
in
lieu
of
the
benefits
provided
by
the
health
and
welfare
plan.
now,
the
significance
of
that
provision,
your
honors,
is
that
in
order
to
set
up
this
trust
to
provide
health
and
welfare
benefits
of
a
very
substantial
nature,
$2000
life
insurance
and
additional
$2000
for
accident
--
accidental
death,
complete
--
practically
complete
hospitalization,
medical
and
surgical
treatment
for
the
laborer
and
his
dependents.
it
was
necessary
to
establish
eligibility
rules
under
which
there
would
be
some
laborers
who
would
perform
work
for
which
money
would
be
paid
into
the
fund
but
would
not
entitle
the
laborer
to
draw
benefits,
to
have
that
coverage
of
the
fund.
in
other
words,
under
the
eligibility
rules
as
pointed
in
the
brief,
established
by
the
trustee,
a
laborer
had
to
work
400
hours
within
a
six-month
period
before
he
would
be
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
the
fund.
on
the
other
hand,
if
he
worked
600
hours
or
800
hours
during
a
six-month
period,
he
got
no
more
in
benefits
than
the
man
who
performed
only
400
hours
of
work,
so
that
you
had
at
least
two
--
three
categories
of
men.
you
would
have
those
who
worked
only
400
hours
who
have
the
minimum
to
qualify
them.
you
have
the
man
who
doesn't
work
400
hours,
who
is
not
qualified
during
that
particular
six-month
period.
and
you
have
a
man
who
works
800
hours,
who
you
might
say
has
had
a
sum
which
is
more
than
necessary
to
provide
him
with
the
benefits
that
are
provided
in
the
fund.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
but
the
way
it
has
--
it
operates
is
that
the
trustees
pay
a
premium
for
the
insurance
that
is
provided.
that
premium
is
an
excess
of
the
$80
a
month,
a
--
a
year
that
is
paid
in
for
the
man
who
works
the
very
minimum
of
800
hours
in
a
year
or
400
hours
in
the
six-month
period.
but
that
increased
benefit
or
ability
to
buy
benefits
comes
from
the
man
who
works
more
than
the
minimum
hours,
it
comes
from
the
man
that
works
less
than
the
minimum
hours.
but
the
great
bulk
of
the
laborers
in
this
collective
bargaining
unit
do
get
covered
by
the
fund.
in
other
words,
the
eligibility
rules
are
low
enough
so
that
every
man
with
--
who's
--
who's
recently
working
in
the
industry
gets
a
coverage
and
every
--
and
the
trustee
whole
nature
of
the
fund
enables
there
to
--
to
be
a
fund
which
provides
definite
benefits
to
all
the
employees
covered
in
the
unit.
and
its
--
every
man
who
works
in
that
unit
has
the
opportunity
to
acquire
the
benefits
of
those
funds
by
working
the
400
hours.
and
the
money
that
goes
into
his
--
into
this
fund
is
the
thing
that
makes
this
fund
possible.
in
other
words,
the
7
1/2
cents
that
was
agreed
to
be
paid
into
the
fund
by
carter
along
with
the
other
contractors
gets
into
that
fund
and
it's
the
lifeline
of
the
program.
without
it,
it
could
not
succeed.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
it
--
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
it
would
be
theoretically
possible
if
none
of
the
men
who
worked
on
the
project
worked
--
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
--
400
hours.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
however,
i
don't
say
that
the
man
does
not
have
the
benefit
of
the
fund
because
the
fund
is
established.
in
order
to
have
it
established,
to
provide
the
substantial
benefits
that
are
provided
and
it
--
was
necessary
in
the
judgment
of
the
trustees
to
establish
minimum
work
requirements.
and
to
my
knowledge,
every
trust
fund
certainly
in
the
health
and
in
the
construction
industry
does
have
minimum
work
requirements.
but
the
man
who
performs
the
labor,
nevertheless,
has
the
benefit
of
it
because
it's
an
established
fund
which
he
can
--
by
performing
400
hours
of
work,
get
the
benefits
of
it.
and
i
want
to
point
out
to
your
honor
that
this
is
a
matter
of
collective-bargaining
under
the
statute,
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
with
the
wagner
act
which
was
enacted
at
the
same
time,
same
session
the
miller
act
was.
the
employers
are
obligated
under
law
to
be
with
the
laborers
district
council
and
with
them
alone.
in
other
words,
this
particular
benefit
being
within
the
scope
of
collective
bargaining
has
held
by
the
courts
of
appeal,
and
this
court
has
denied
certiorari,
is
one
on
which
the
contractor
could
not
make
an
arrangement
with
his
--
his
own
employees,
the
laborers.
his
arrangement
must
be
with
the
union.
now,
the
union
in
order
to
establish
a
health
and
welfare
fund
that
would
be
sound
and
workable
in
the
construction
industry
with
its
casual
type
of
employment.
in
the
exercise,
we
submit,
of
the
authority
which
this
court
has
recognized
in
cases
like
ford
motor
company
against
huffman
has
determined
that
it
is
a
proper
matter
to
provide
that
the
money
of
tens
--
7
1/2
cents
per
hour
shall
be
paid
into
the
fund,
two
trustees,
who
then,
under
the
authority
given
in
the
trust
agreement,
can
provide
reasonable
and
nondiscriminatory
eligibility
rules
under
which
it
is
possible
that
some
laborers
who
do
not
work
sufficient
hours
will
not
receive
benefit.
but
the
great
majority
of
the
laborers
within
the
unit
are
able
to
work
the
400
hours
and
do
receive
the
benefit.
and
it's
our
position,
as
we've
developed
it
in
the
brief,
that
the
laborers
union
had
the
power
to
negotiate
such
agreement
and
that
it
did
negotiate
such
an
agreement
and
that
is
a
part
of
such
an
agreement,
it
gave
to
the
trustees
the
power
to
sue
for
and
collect
the
contributions
that
are
called
for
by
the
collective-bargaining
agreement.
the
contributions
are
not
unrelated
to
the
--
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
it's
expressed,
your
honor,
in
the
trust
agreement.
there
is
the
provision
of
section
3
of
article
iv
that
the
board
of
trustee
shall
have
the
power
to
demand
and
enforce
the
prompt
payment
of
contributions
to
the
fund.
i
realize
that
the
obligation
to
--
to
make
those
payments
rest
in
the
collective-bargaining
agreement.
the
union
has
set
in
its
negotiations
with
the
employers
and
by
its
contract
with
the
employers
that
such
payments
shall
go
to
the
trustees
and
that
they
shall
have
the
power
and
authority
to
enforce
these
things.
and
i
want
to
bring
out
on
other
point
which
was
emphasized
by
respondents
in
the
lower
court
and
which
they
--
that
was
--
were
raised
before
your
honors.
the
man
received
the
benefit
of
a
contribution
that
was
--
should
be
made
under
a
collective-bargaining
agreement
even
though
the
contribution
is
actually
in
default.
in
other
words,
the
man
who
worked
on
carter's
project
received
the
benefit
of
the
money
that
was
due
from
carter
even
though
carter
to
this
date
has
not
paid
it.
for
this
reason,
these
are
trustees
by
the
collective-bargaining
agreement.
they
have
been
given
the
power
and
authority
to
enforce
this
portion
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement,
the
obligation
to
pay
into
the
fund.
and
they
consider
that
as
trustees,
it
is
their
obligation
to
enforce
it
that
they
should
enforce
it
as
trustees
for
the
laborers.
and
that
therefore,
even
though
the
man
--
the
money
has
not
reached
the
fund,
still,
the
contractual
obligation
that
rest
on
the
employer
is
sufficient
to
give
the
trustees
the
authority
to
give
credit
to
the
man
for
the
hours
that
he
worked
under
the
collective-bargaining
agreement.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
section
106.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
it
provide
that
employer
contributions
to
funds
or
--
or
for
welfare
of
his
employees,
i
think
it
covers
more
than
just
welfare,
are
to
be
excluded
from
gross
income.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
no,
sir,
no.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
the
internal
revenue
code,
there
are
--
and
maybe
that
the
internal
revenue
code
expressed
that
he
excludes
health
and
welfare
contributions
from
wages
in
definition
of
the
act.
certainly,
the
social
security
act
does.
it
excludes
from
the
definition
of
compensation
the
contributions
of
employers
to
health
and
welfare.
but
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief,
it's
our
position,
that
doesn't
mean
that
they
are
not
to
be
considered
compensation
for
labor.
the
very
fact
that
congress
saw
necessary
--
deemed
it
necessary
to
exclude
them
by
expressed
terms.
in
our
view
of
the
matter,
argues
very
strongly
that
they
are
compensation
for
services
and
they
are
in
a
very
broad
sense
--
sense
wages
because
this
--
the
courts
of
appeal
would
have
held
that
they
are
wages
within
the
meaning
of
the
national
labor
regulations
act.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
they
would
be
wages,
i'm
sure,
your
honor.
the
exclusion
there
is
that
by
regulation,
they
are
excluded
from
the
--
from
the
wages
for
the
purpose
of
computing
--
a
regular
rate
for
the
purpose
of
computing
overtime.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
yes.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
no.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
that's
the
crux
of
it,
your
honor.
we
--
we
maintain
that
the
trustees,
by
virtue
of
this
collective-bargaining
agreements,
by
virtue
of
the
action
that's
been
taken
by
the
union
and
any
employers,
are
in
effect
and
in
actual
law,
in
fact,
under
the
california
decisions
as
a
need
of
the
laborers
pro
rata
for
this
portion
of
their
compensation.
and
they
are
given
by
the
trust
agreement
the
authority
to
sue
and
we
have
alleged
it
in
our
complaint
as
--
which
has
been
admitted
in
--
for
the
purposes
of
summary
judgment
that
we
sue
in
behalf
of
and
as
the
representatives
of
the
laborers.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
because
as
we
interpret
it,
the
power
to
sue
is
in
the
trustees,
this
portion
of
it.
now,
the
union
--
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
the
union
will
--
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
well,
in
trust
--
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
well,
i
think,
your
honor
--
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
well
--
but
your
honor,
the
--
the
union
who
is
a
collective
bargaining
representative
of
the
laborers
and
the
agents
then
speak
for
the
laborers
has
said,
“this
particular
portion
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement,
the
actual
collection
of
the
money
shall
be
handled
by
trustees
for
the
laborers.”
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
it
could
qualify
the
rights
given
under
the
miller
act,
your
honor,
if
the
--
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
well,
i
think
--
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
well,
i
don't
make
that
argument,
your
honor,
but
i
do
argue
that
these
are
a
part
of
a
--
these
payments
are
a
part
of
the
compensation
of
the
workmen.
and
by
reason
of
that,
they
are
a
subject
of
collective-bargaining
agreement,
collective
bargaining
with
the
union.
now,
the
fact
that
they
are
a
part
of
the
compensation
for
labor,
in
term,
brings
them
within
the
miller
act.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
well,
but
--
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
well,
therefore,
it
may
not
follow,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
the
very
fact
that
these
are
payments
for
labor
are
--
is
the
controlling
consideration
in
the
decision
of
this
case.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
the
record
--
there's
no
allegation
as
to
how
they
came
to
the
carter.
of
course,
in
--
in
normal
operation
of
labor
unions
in
the
46-county
the
area,
many
men
comes
through
the
union
office.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
yes,
they
will.
of
course,
either
--
he
may
not
have
an
office
to
which
they
report.
they
may
report
to
the
job.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
they
have
to
report
to
someone
to
get
instructions
and
get
on
a
payroll.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
yes,
under
the
collective-bargaining
agreements,
he
has
the
sole
right
to
determine
whether
he
will
employ
--
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
yes.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
that
is
a
part
of
the
consideration
for
the
laborer
--
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
--
labor
of
the
men
that
are
would
perform
the
work.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
i
would
say
two
conditions,
your
honor.
the
measurement
by
the
hours
of
work
performed
and
the
fact
there
is
a
consideration
for
the
labor
that
is
performed.
i
don't
know
about
any
other
measure
that
you
might
use
but
i
would
certainly
say
that
if
it's
measured
by
hours
of
work
performed,
then
it
would
be
within
the
miller
act.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
the
trustees?
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
if
his
employer
were
--
was
obligated
to
pay
into
the
fund,
yes
whether
or
not
he
paid
his
--
the
wages.
under
the
collective-bargaining
agreement,
there's
an
obligation
also
to
pay
wages
but
that
is
for
the
union
to
enforce.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
the
union
or
the
men?
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
your
honor,
these
collective-bargaining
agreements
do
not
provide
for
union
security.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
they
are
largely
unionized.
yes,
your
honor.
