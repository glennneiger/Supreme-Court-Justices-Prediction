mr.
miller,
is
there
anything
in
the
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
mr.
stanton,
is
there
anything
in
the
miller
act
bearing
on
or
dealing
with
--
explicit
in
dealing
with
sanctions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
your
argument
gets
down
to
this,
that
--
that
nothing
in
the
implication
of
the
miller
act
bars
what
you
say
is
an
effective
assignment
here
on
this
trust
agreement,
is
that
the
crux
of
the
agreement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
you
please
tell
me
why,
and
for
a
good
reason,
why
this
key
thing
likes
or
in
pursuit
by
way
of
the
class,
in
the
name
of
the
laborers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
never
[laughs]
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
have
to
mean
--
i
don't
see
that
they
have
to
ignore
it
and
excluded
them
they
raise
the
kind
of
an
assignment
of
group
which
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
if
you
enlighten
--
it
wouldn't
bar
unless
i'm
--
unless
i
hear
more
than
i
have
heard.
the
laborers
themselves
can
sue.you
certainly
can't
say
under
this
agreement,
they
can't
assert
their
individual
rights.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
(voice
overlap)
and
because
of
collective
agreement
that
makes
an
arrangement
for
such
a
trust
fund.
the
problems
of
who
can
sue
is
a
different
problem.
it's
the
procedural
problem
under
the
miller
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
all
that.
that's
clear
enough,
but
--
but
there's
a
miller
act
which
makes
it
a
provision.
it
creates
rights
and
provide
procedures.
and
no
collective
agreement
would
override
that
or
qualify
to
assuming
that
that
makes
restrictions
on
the
arrangements
to
be
made
between
the
union
and
the
individual
members.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
denying,
i'm
not
suggesting.
all
i'm
saying
is
the
fact
that
the
union
done,
may
and
does
act
for
the
men.
it
doesn't
help
me
to
--
doesn't
help
me
very
far
in
interpreting
the
miller
act,
except
that
the
miller
act
was
deciding
on
the
subject
or
on
this
political
then
general
consideration,
the
breaking
in
policies
will
come
into
play.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
you
can
jump
from
the
fact
that
they
made
this
arrangement
with
the
union,
ergo,
the
miller
act
is
satisfied.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
in
terms
because
you've
got
to
come
over
and
get
on
with
the
trial
of
the
specific
language
which
determines
the
decision
of
the
--
both
judge
goodman
and
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
you
can't.
all
i'm
saying
is
you
can't
jump
from
a
case
like
ford
against
huffman,
ford
motor
company,
and
say,
therefore,
that
decision
was
wrong.
i
don't
think
that
therefore,
it
follows.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
dinkelspiel,
it
isn't
clear
to
me.
i
don't
mean
to
say
--
it
has
been
made
clear
but
it
isn't
clear
to
me,
whether
this
--
whether
the
problem
in
the
case
is
merely
a
question
of
the
appropriate
party
to
assume
who
can
sue,
or
is
there
involved
also
in
that
question
the
amount
for
which
a
suit
maybe
brought?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
now,
would
you
deal
with
the
latter
one
too
and
show
what
difference
it
makes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
the
second
part
that
i'd
like
to
have
light
shed
on.
that
may
be
so
and
yet
he
may,
either
the
trustee
or
an
assignee
sue
for
the
person
who
could
support
himself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
indulgent
sense.would
it
make
any
difference
if
this
were
as
i
suggested
a
minute
ago,
a
class
suit
on
behalf
of
the
specific
laborer
to
work
on
this
project.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
have
--
i
have
made
myself
interested
to
this.
i'm
not
--
i
put
to
one
side
for
the
moment
whether
in
fact
there
was
an
implied
assignment.
i'm
putting
to
that
to
one
side.
i'm
asking
you
whether
if
the
trustees
were
out
of
it
altogether.
john
doe,
one
of
the
fellows
who
worked
on
this
project
sued
on
behalf
of
himself
and
all
the
other
(inaudible)
and
that
--
who
worked
on
the
project.
would
there
be
any
difference
in
the
amount
of
recovery
in
such
a
clear-cut
conventional
classes
and
what
is
sought
for
him
by
the
trustees,
not
suing
as
a
class
suit
but
is
suing
trustees
under
the
trust
agreement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
has
found
that
but
if
he
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
an
equal
rights
under
the
--
what
right
is
regarded
under
the
miller
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
has
anybody
any
right
to
sue
for
these
contributions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
merely
arguing
here
that
as
--
as
the
surety
--
that
that
the
restricted
obligation
of
the
surety
does
not
include
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
was
the
bond
given
to
carry
out
the
requirements
of
the
miller
act,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
then
the
miller
act
--
the
requirements
of
the
miller
act
are
at
least
in
prior
included
in
this
fund,
are
they
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
the
purpose
for
which
the
bond
is
given
is
to
be
associated
from
the
miller
act.
it's
in
the
light
of
that
that
he
must
construe
the
scope
of
the
bond,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
now,
what
is,
as
you
understand
it,
the
requirements
of
the
miller
act,
as
to
the
kind
of
the
bond
or
the
scope
of
the
bond
to
be
given
by
carter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
understand
to
be
the
association.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
put
him
to
one
side,
as
what
you've
said
a
little
a
while
ago
that
the
trust
agreement
followed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
agreement
came
later
than
the
surety
bond.
isn't
it
relevant
--
isn't
the
ford
case
which
i
deem
to
one
respect
irrelevant
to
the
statute
argument,
relevant?
it
is
the
--
that
the
terms
of
the
miller
act
for
the
protection
of
all
persons
supplying
labor
and
materials
in
the
prosecution
of
the
words.
if
the
person
supplying
labor
and
the
material
a
part
of
the
union
which
has
--
will
then
secure
certain
terms
with
the
supply
of
their
laborers
aren't
almost
done,
which
my
brother
harlan
a
minute
called
--
a
minute
ago
called
the
fringe
benefits.
if
they
are
the
arrangements
made
between
the
union
speaking
for
the
men
who
supply
the
laborer
and
the
contractor
--
we'll
get
in
a
moment
to
the
collective
agreement.
doesn't
that
--
isn't
that
to
be
read
into
provision
of
one
or
two?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
the
bond
--
because
the
bond
may
have
it
all
for
the
voluntarily
assumption
of
obligation
but
you
say
it
doesn't,
as
a
matter
of
law,
cover
anything
except
the
terms
of
the
contract
agreement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
you
have
to
go
to
the
contract
agreement
to
see
what
it
is
that
the
laborers
supply
--
the
material
men
supply
that
you
underwrote.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
your
building
industry
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
but
i'm
--
in
fact
--
in
fact
aren't
building
industry
largely
unionized
on
the
books?
