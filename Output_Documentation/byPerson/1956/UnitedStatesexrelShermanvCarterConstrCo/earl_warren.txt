for
the
benefit
and
on
behalf
of
harry
sherman,
et
al.,
petitioners,
versus
donald
g.carter.
mr.
stanton.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
--
does
the
surety
admit
the
collective-bargaining
agreement?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
dinkelspiel.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
dinkelspiel,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
trustees
could
sue
the
contractor
for
--
for
these
7
1/2
cents
an
hour.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
gave
birth
to
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
trust
agreement
is
based
on
some
other
right,
isn't
it?
and
--
and
what
right
has
accrued
that
gives
them
the
right
to
sue?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
--
but
isn't
there
is
something
before
that?
isn't
it
the
labor
of
these
men?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
would
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
couldn't
before
if
it
wasn't
for
the
labor
of
these
men?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
what
gives
them
the
right
--
what
gives
him
the
right
to
collect
that
--
that
welfare
fund?is
it
not
the
--
the
labor
that's
been
performed
by
these
men?
chief
justice
earl
warren
let's
assume
that
it
was,
wouldn't
it
still
be
--
wouldn't
it
still
be
--
depend
upon
the
labor
that
these
men
had
performed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then,
if
it
--
if
it
was
based
upon
the
labor
that
these
men
performed,
would
it
not
come
within
section
2
(a)
which
says,
“every
person
who
has
furnished
labor
in
respect
of
which
a
payment
bond
is
furnished
and
who
has
not
been
paid
in
full
therefore
shall
have
the
right?”
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
they
had
become
injured
on
the
job,
they
would
have
received
benefits,
would
they
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
no
--
and
well,
suppose
they
had
some
of
the
things
--
some
of
the
eventualities
that
--
that
this
fund
was
set
up
for,
occurred
while
they
were
working.
they
get
the
benefit
of
it,
wouldn't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
does
the
fact
that
they
don't
--
most
of
them
would
not
get
any
benefits
because
the
eventualities
wouldn't
arise,
mean
that
they
had
not
received
any
benefits
from
that
agreement?
a
lot
of
us
carry
insurance
all
our
lives
and
--
and
we
were
happy
that
we
--
that
we
haven't
received
any
benefits
from
them
but
that
is
monetary
benefits.
but
certainly,
it's
been
a
benefit
to
us
to
have
that
protection,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
and
doesn't
that
protection
--
isn't
that
protection
a
benefit
for
these
men?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
dinkelspiel,
the
thing
that
bothers
me,
if
it
isn't
consideration
for
labor,
what
is
that
consideration?
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
the
payment
of
these
7
1/2
cents
an
hour?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean,
is
it
related
to
labor?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then,
let's
say
it
shall
be
measured
by
the
hour,
7
1/2
cents
an
hour
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
for
the
work
that
is
--
the
work
that
is
--
is
put
on
the
job?
