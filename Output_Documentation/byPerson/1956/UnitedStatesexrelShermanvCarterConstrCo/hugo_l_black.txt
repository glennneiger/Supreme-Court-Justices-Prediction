suppose
there
had
been
individual
contracts
for
these
employees
by
which
they
were
to
be
paid
$50
a
month
--
a
week,
get
$10
a
week
deposited
in
a
bank
to
act
as
trustee
for
the
welfare
of
the
employee
and
his
family
when
they
were
sick.
were
there
right
on
the
part
of
the
bank
to
sue?do
you
think
your
bond
would
cover
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
went
into
a
bank
for
him
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
was
conditioned
on
the
fact
that
as
long
as
he
state
that
word
“labor”
for
them,
he
would
be
paid
$50
a
month
--
a
week
and
$10
a
week
would
be
deposited
in
the
fund
for
the
bank
to
act
as
trustee
as
i
stated.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
--
if
the
case
i
mentioned
was,
that
money
was
to
be
used
by
the
bank
and
administered
as
a
trustee
for
the
benefit
of
the
man
and
his
family.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
--
you
think
he
could
sue?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
in
the
other
case,
you
think
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
quite
understand
the
statement.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
haven't
quite
gotten
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
read
and
ask
you
that
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
him
and
his
family.
justice
hugo
l.

with
the
bank
to
have
the
right
to
sue
and
he
would
not
have
the
right
to
sue
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
may
not
have
an
interest
in
the
--
so
that
he
could
take
them
out,
but
he
has
an
interest
to
the
fund
that
he
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
entitled,
dosen't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
mean
--
i
don't
mean
in
law
that
he
has
some
interest
for
which
he
could
sue.but
do
you
mean
that
he's
not
interested
in
that
fund
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
so
that
he
might
get
benefits
from
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
he's
done
realistically,
i
suppose,
is
to
agree
that
the
agreement
made
that
in
addition
to
his
wages
while
he's
there,
that's
covered
and
will
pay
a
certain
amount
into
a
fund
which
he
hopes
he
will
get
something
out
of
in
the
future.
