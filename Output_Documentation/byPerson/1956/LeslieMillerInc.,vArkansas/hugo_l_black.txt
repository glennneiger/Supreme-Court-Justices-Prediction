justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
your
state
court
settled
that,
hasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
protect
the
government
from
unscrupulous
contractor?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
you
have
to
--
have
to
pass
(inaudible)
thing,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
suppose
maybe
the
chief
question
would
be
whether
the
government
which
probably
has
the
constitutional
power
to
decide
who
it
wants
to
hire
had
done
so,
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
about
pacific
coast
dairies?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
going
to
mention
hill
against
florida?
justice
hugo
l.
black
hill
against
florida.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
does
it
provide
some
for
kind
of
an
investigation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
for
these
contractors?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
if
a
--
if
an
irresponsible
man
makes
a
bid
--
lowest
does
the
government
have
to
take
him
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
he's
irresponsible?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you.
this
is
to
--
we
said
that
hill
against
florida
that
this
man
under
that
law
could
be
convicted
of
a
misdemeanor
and
subjected
to
fine
and
imprisonment,
but
doing
something
which
the
federal
government
has
--
has
stipulated
he
could
do
(inaudible)
does
that
fit
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
doing
that
which
an
act
of
congress
permits
him
to
do.
does
an
act
of
congress
permit
this
man
to
do
this
work
if
he
is
a
low
bidder?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
he
come
within
the
--
does
he
come
within
the
classes,
within
the
category
of
people
who
are
permitted
to
make
bids
and
do
works
for
the
government
as
provided
in
the
acts
of
congress?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
why
is
not
true
then
that
this
is
to
be
measured
by
whether
the
state
can
forbid
him
to
do
that
and
convict
him
of
a
misdemeanor,
but
doing
that,
which
is
an
act
of
congress
permits
him
to
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
have
to
reconcile?
suppose
the
federal
government
makes
the
case,
where
i
hope
you
can.
suppose
the
federal
government
decided
it
wanted
to
employ
doctors
who
had
come
here
from
abroad
in
the
federal
--
veteran
hospitals,
maybe
who's
a
refugee
and
the
state
wouldn't
give
him
a
license,
could
the
federal
government
employ
him
or
would
it
be
forbidden
to
do
so?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
public
health.
that's
--
does
it
matter
as
they
didn't
conflict
with
an
act
of
congress?
the
government
of
the
states
have
their
full
power
in
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
we
have
--
why
do
we
have
to
argue
over
whether
this
comes
within
one
category
of
business
or
another?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
the
government
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
other
--
other
can
be
considered,
i
assume,
in
determining
whether
there
--
there's
a
conflict
to
be
found.
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
whether
the
act
the
federal
congress
did
not
intend
to
do
as
much
as
you're
suggesting.
that
what
that
says
that
it's
found
that
the
federal
congress
has
decided
that
and
it
wants
to
hire
somebody
to
do
a
particular
kind
of
work.
on
the
constitutional
level,
what
else
is
there
to
negate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
they
did.
