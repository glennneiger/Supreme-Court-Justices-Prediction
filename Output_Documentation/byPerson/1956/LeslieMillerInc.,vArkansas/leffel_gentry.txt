mr.
leffel
gentry
may
it
please,
your
honors.
leslie
miller
is
a
corporation
engaged
in
the
general
contracting
business.
as
such
a
corporation
it
entered
the
--
it
submitted
a
bid
for
the
construction
of
certain
facilities
in
the
state
of
arkansas
in
connection
with
an
airport
facility
and
it
entered
in
the
performance
of
that
contract
after
having
been
awarded
the
bid.
in
this
action
appearing
here,
is
the
result
of
prosecution
of
leslie
miller
by
the
state
of
arkansas
for
having
violated
the
provisions
of
act
124
of
1939
as
amended
by
act
217
of
1945,
in
that,
as
a
general
contractor,
he
had
done
these
things
without
having
been
licensed
by
the
state
licensing
board
for
general
contractors.
the
action
was
tried
in
the
lower
court
upon
a
stipulation
of
facts;
and
under
that
stipulation
of
facts
in
addition
to
those
facts
in
the
district
county,
it
both
appeared
that
bids
were
received
for
the
construction
of
the
facilities
from
licensed
contractors
within
the
state
of
arkansas,
but
that
such
bids
were
in
excess
of
the
bid
of
the
appellant.
and
it
further
appeared
from
the
stipulation
that
other
contractors
would
have
submitted
bids
in
connection
with
the
construction
of
the
facilities
had
it
not
been
for
the
requirements
that
they
first
be
licensed.
the
appellant
was
convicted
in
the
lower
court,
notwithstanding,
his
assertion.
its
assertion
that
the
application
of
the
contractors
licensing
board
act,
the
arkansas
contractors
licensing
board
act
to
wit
was
unconstitutional
inasmuch
as
it
amounted
to
an
interference
with
the
federal
function
that
congressional
acts
and
regulations
pursuant
thereto
accomplished
the
purposes
intended
by
the
state
act.
upon
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
and
again,
the
urging
of
that
question,
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
from
whence
an
appeal
was
brought
to
this
court
and
the
court
--
the
case
is
here
on
appeal
by
way,
of
course,
the
jurisdictional
statement
having
been
filed
and
the
court
having
indicated
the
hearing.
if
your
honors
please,
it's
the
position
of
the
appellant
in
this
case
and
first,
i
should
say
that
the
government
has
filed
a
brief
amicus
curiae
in
the
case
and
we
are
providing
a
ton
as
i
understand
under
the
directions
we've
been
given
and
i
shall
confine
myself
to
a
general
discussion
of
the
principle
involved
here
rather
than
to
cover
specifically
the
many
instances
in
which
we
feel
that
there
is
an
interference
with
the
governmental
function.
that
feature
of
the
case
will
be
handled
by
counsel
for
the
government.there
is
a
fundamental
question
involved
here,
of
course.
the
question
which
necessarily
arises
at
such
a
time
when
a
state
in
the
purported
exercise
of
its
sovereign
police
power
enacts
a
measure
such
as
the
act
here
on
the
consideration,
the
contractors
licensing
board
act,
which
the
court
will
find
as
an
appendix
in
the
back
of
the
jurisdictional
statement.
this
act,
supposedly
by
its
title,
has
for
its
purpose
the
regulation
of
the
practicing
of
general
contracting
within
the
state
of
arkansas
and
general
contracting
within
the
state
of
arkansas
is
then,
thereafter,
it
defined
so
as
to
include,
we
can
see
the
appellant
in
the
instance
of
bidding
upon
the
work
for
the
government
and
exercising
the
right
to
perform
the
contract
after
having
been
awarded
the
contract.
in
other
words,
there's
no
dispute
between
the
parties
as
to
the
applicability
of
the
act
in
the
sense
that
the
corporation
here
is
a
general
contractor
under
the
definitions
of
that.
the
issue
here
though
arises,
as
to
whether
the
state
of
arkansas
by
this
act
can
require
the
appellant
under
the
guise
of
police
power
to
get
a
license
in
order
to
be
able
to
contract
with
the
federal
government
for
the
construction
of
the
facilities.
it
is
our
position,
in
this
case,
that
the
government
of
the
nation
and
the
government
of
the
state
are,
of
course,
each
alike,
absolute
and
independent
in
its
--
in
their
respective
spheres,
but
when
conflict
arises,
that
the
enactment
of
the
national
government,
of
course,
has
supremacy.
in
this
instance,
the
question
arises
first
as
to
a
conflict
and
the
question
arises
as
to
the
conflict
in
two
aspects.
it
is
our
position
that
there
is
no
conflict
between
the
congressional
enactments
and
the
right
of
congress
to
regulate
as
to
its
ports,
docks
and
arsenals
under
the
constitution's
provision
and
under
the
regulations
that
have
been
enacted
pursuant
to
the
congressional
enactment,
that
there
is
no
conflict
between
the
exercise
of
that
power
which
congress
has
undertaken,
and
the
exercise
of
the
state
of
its
sovereign
power
to
protect
its
citizens
in
this
instance.
we
say
that
for
this
reason.
the
only
object
and
purpose
which
the
act
under
consideration
could
possibly
have
is
the
protection
of
the
welfare,
safety
and
peace
of
the
people
of
the
state
of
arkansas.
it
could
not
have
for
its
object
and
purpose
the
protection
of
the
federal
government.
then
having
solely
for
its
purpose,
the
protection
of
the
welfare,
peace
and
safety
of
its
citizens,
if
as
a
matter
of
fact,
congress
in
the
exercise
of
it's
expressly
delegated
exclusive
power
to
regulate
its
ports,
docks,
arsenals
which
would
include
this
airport
construction,
if
it
has
acted,
if
congress
has
acted,
so
as
to
regulate
it
and
if
in
the
course
of
its
acting,
it
has,
by
its
enactments,
already
done
the
thing
which
would
be
accomplished
by
the
state
act
that
if
it
has
so
regulated
that
the
state's
--
that
the
citizens
of
the
state's
welfare,
health
and
safety
is
amply
protected,
then
we
say
that
we
have
no
issue
really
to
decide
other
than
the
question
of
whether
there
is
any
conflict
there.
and
we
say
in
this
instance
that
there
is
no
such
conflict.
a
study
of
the
act
showed
that
it
could
have
but
one
purpose
and
that
is,
the
protection
of
the
citizens
of
the
state
of
arkansas
from
--
in
their
dealings
with
contractors
from
those
contractors
who
were
not
qualified
or
who
were
not
ethical,
who
were
unscrupulous
and
so,
would
take
advantage
of
the
people.
now,
that
right
can
be
protected
and
continue
to
be
protected
by
the
state
of
arkansas
through
the
application
of
this
act
to
all
of
the
contractors
who
deal
with
the
people
in
the
state
of
arkansas.
there
can
be
no
purpose
saved
or
served
in
applying
the
act
to
the
government
under
the
guise
that
the
government
needs
to
be
protected
by
the
state
of
arkansas
in
its
dealings
with
contractors
from
those
contractors
who
would
deal
with
it
unethically
or
unscrupulously.
so
in
the
outset
of
this
argument,
if
your
honors
please,
i
take
the
position
seriously
that
there
is
no
conflict
between
the
sovereign
power
of
arkansas
in
the
exercise
of
its
police
power
under
the
act
under
consideration
with
the
exercise
of
the
exclusive
power
of
congress
to
regulate
as
to
these
ports,
docks,
arsenals,
airports,
other
matters
that
come
within
that
terminology.
mr.
leffel
gentry
sir?
mr.
leffel
gentry
yes,
sir.
in
the
sense
that
the
--
i
should
distinguish,
i'd
say.
if
this
is
a
plumbing
contractor
and
he
is
dealing
with
the
government
and
the
government
by
its
rules
and
regulations
is
able
to
protect
itself
from
the
plumbing
contractor
in
its
relationship
with
it
and
that
is
the
only
object
and
the
purpose
of
the
act,
then
i
say
it
could
be
--
possibly
no
reason
for
the
issue
to
get
to
the
point
to
where
we
have
that
question
of
the
intergovernmental
immunities.
now,
i
go
one
step
further.
mr.
leffel
gentry
you
license
plumbing
contractors
to
protect
the
health
of
the
people,
but
license
mean
the
plumber's
contractor
to
work
on
a
particular
job
for
the
government
would
not
interfere
with
the
health
of
the
people
so
long
as
the
only
job
that
they
did
without
a
license
was
the
job
they
performed
for
the
government,
because
the
government
by
its
statutes
has
protected
that
citizen
from
the
hazard
which
may
come
by
reason
of
the
qualifications
that
it
has
set
forth
that
this
contractor
had
--
must
have.
in
other
words,
we
take
the
position,
if
your
honors,
please,
that
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
a
situation
similar
to
the
situation
involved
in
the
penn
milk
case
versus
the
board
of
milk
control
commission
where
you
have
a
proposition
to
the
decide
between
the
inherent
power
of
the
state
to
protect
the
welfare
of
its
citizens
and
against
the
power
of
the
government
or
the
right
of
the
government
to
exercise
a
particular
function
exclusively.
we
do
not
have
that
situation.
here,
we
have
a
situation
which
the
contractor
can
perform
the
function
under
the
regulations,
under
the
congressional
statutes
for
the
government
without
any
fear
as
to
the
rights
of
the
people
or
arkansas
being
adversely
affected.
mr.
leffel
gentry
i
think
it
has
no
--
absolutely
no
purpose
whatsoever
in
that
connection.
mr.
leffel
gentry
if,
your
honor,
please,
i
can
only
answer
that
with
reference
again
to
the
--
the
specific
statute,
and
i
can't
find,
nowhere
in
this
statute,
any
such
intent
and,
of
course,
we
do
not
have
the
advantage
of
having
statements
as
to
the
intent
like
you
have
in
congressional
enactments
by
the
committee
reports
in
those
matters
that
are
statements
there
made.
we
have
to
take
the
act
itself
and
read
it
all
together
and
gain
the
intent
from
that.
but
as
far
as
i
can
see
this
act
and
i
may
be
prejudiced
in
the
cause
of
my
client,
but
as
far
as
i
can
see
it,
i
can
see
nothing
except
that
it
was
intended
to
protect
people
in
their
dealings
with
contractors
and
it
has
no
relation
whatever
to
the
employees.
mr.
leffel
gentry
oh,
you
mean
--
i
--
i
see
you
mean
by
that
as
far
as
they're
contracting
with
them
--
mr.
leffel
gentry
--
for
the
work
for
a
certain
wage
or
something
of
that
sort?
mr.
leffel
gentry
well,
i
think
that
answers
part
of
that
because
i
think
it
speaks
in
terminology
of
the
qualifications
of
the
contractors
to
perform
the
jobs
that
they're
seeking
to
perform
rather
than
dealing
with
the
qualifications
that
they
may
have
as
far
as
dealing
with
their
employees.
now,
if
your
honors,
please,
we
take
the
position
secondly,
that
if
this
act
has
for
its
purpose,
if
this
act
has
for
its
purpose
the
protection
of
the
health,
welfare
and
safety
in
the
instance
and
which
a
contractor
is
dealing
with
the
federal
government,
that
if
so,
that
then
that
protection
that
is
sought
to
be
afforded
which
we
say
is
not
there,
not
intended,
but
that
that
protection
is
afforded
by
the
federal
statutes
and
regulations.
and
we
do
say
this
your
honor
that
the
imposition
of
this
act
upon
the
appellant
in
this
case
will
deprive
the
government
of
its
right
to
select
its
agent
--
agents
and
determine
the
competency
of
those
with
whom
it'd
be.
mr.
leffel
gentry
well,
it
was
a
tremendous
airport
project
in
which
there
is
a
air
base
that
is
one
of
the
larger
air
bases
that
the
--
where
the
big
bombers
are
and
they
have
the
personnel
there
that
is
refrain.
they're
on
the
base.
so
it's
a
tremendous
undertaking
as
far
as
the
extent
and
size
of
the
facilities.
now
then,
i
would
like
to
call
your
attention
to
this
one
thing
in
connection
with
the
chief
justice's
question.
in
this
act,
it
purports
to
define
a
general
contractor
as
those
making
contracts
for
the
construction
of
certain
described
things
involving
an
amount
in
excess
of
$20,000.
now
then,
i
take
the
position
that
if
anything
is
intended
to
be
protected
by
that
act
other
than
to
protect
the
citizens
of
the
state
who
deal
with
the
contractor
and
not
the
government
when
it
deals
with
it,
that
if
they
were
intended
to
protect
the
safety
and
health
and
so
forth
of
the
employee
over
here
or
his
welfare
as
the
chief
justice
has
mentioned,
then
his
safety,
health
and
welfare
is
just
as
well
involved
in
a
contract
involving
$19,000
as
it
is
and
one
involving
$20,000.
so,
i
use
that
as
an
illustration
to
say
that
this
act
in
my
humble
opinion
could
have
no
object
and
purpose
except
the
protection
of
the
local
citizens
from
unscrupulous
contractors
and
its
absobility
or
its
inabsolubility,
i
should
say,
to
the
government,
because
of
the
reasons
we
here
assert
would
not
let
the
protection
which
was
intended
to
be
both,
are
purported
by
that.
mr.
leffel
gentry
sir?
mr.
leffel
gentry
yes,
sir.
they
do.
mr.
leffel
gentry
well,
we
have
--
we
have
a
--
a
glimpse
at
--
at
a
--
another
purpose
in
the
emergency
clause
contained
in
the
act
because
it
says
on
page
--
pardon
me
if
i
may
--
on
page
--
yes,
on
page
30
of
the
jurisdictional
statement,
at
the
top
of
the
page,
section
22,
"is
hereby
determined
and
declared
to
be
a
fact
that
the
practice
of
general
contracting
in
the
state
of
arkansas
is
in
need
of
regulations
and
it
viewed
the
unethical
practices
of
contractors
within
the
state
of
being
unduly
penalized
and
are
suffering
irreparable
injuries
and
this
act
being
necessary
for
the
preservation
of
the
public
peace,
health
and
safety
and
emergency
hereby
declared
to
exist
and
this
act
shall
take
effect
of
the
(inaudible).
we
glean
there
--
mr.
leffel
gentry
well,
unethical
practices
among
the
contractors
themselves
is
what
it
sounds
if
they
are
dealing
with
rather
than
dealing
with
and
therefore,
they
want
to
regulator
the
contractors
so
as
to
permit
--
prohibit
these
unethical
practices
among
themselves
so
that
the
public's
welfare
can
be
protected.
mr.
leffel
gentry
no,
sir.
none,
whatever.
mr.
leffel
gentry
sir?
mr.
leffel
gentry
yes,
sir.
mr.
leffel
gentry
now
--
mr.
leffel
gentry
it
could
have
been.
i
do
not
assert
that
as
a
fact
because
i
do
not
know
whether
you
would
require
me
to
go
out
of
the
record,
if
i
didn't
know
it.
and
i
do
not.
but
i
say
that
in
determining
the
object
and
purposes
of
this
act
and
determining
whether
or
not
the
government
is
going
to
be
hampered
to
the
extent
as
indicated
by
the
stipulation
in
this
case
that
here
in
this
instance,
licensed
contractors
within
the
state
it'd
be
they
were
not
the
lowest
responsible
bidder,
also
indicated
by
the
stipulation
in
this
case
that
there
was
admittedly
other
contractors
that
would
have
bid
except
that
they
were
deterred
because
of
the
prohibitions
of
this
act.
they
didn't
want
to.
the
--
the
act
provides
for
certain
--
certain
application
of
a
license,
certain
times
within
which
the
license
can
be
acted
upon
certain
meetings
of
the
board
at
certain
intervals.
it's
our
position
in
this
case
that
if
--
that
if
there
is
a
serious
conflict
with
the
right
of
the
sovereign
state
to
exercise
these
functions
under
its
police
power,
then
we
recognize
that
this
court
might
likely
say
as
it
did
in
the
penn
milk
dairy
case
that
the
act
would
not
likely
struck
--
be
struck
down
simply
because
of
the
economic
words
that
might
be
upon
the
government
as
a
consequence
of
the
applicability
of
the
act.
but
where
the
burden's
upon
the
government
in
the
situation
are
much
greater
than
simply
economic
burdens
whereas
will
be
shown
by
counsel
for
government
in
his
argument
in
detail,
i
think
that
it
so
happens
the
government,
that
tomorrow
--
tomorrow,
if
they
have
to
depend
only
upon
licensed
contractors
within
the
state
of
arkansas
to
do
their
job,
they
may
not
have
them
available
when
they
want
them
available
and
when
they
need
a
job
to
be
done.
now,
one
more
statement
and
i
shall
conclude.
mr.
leffel
gentry
no,
sir.
there
is
not.
i
recognize
the
difficulty
that
your
honors
have,
that
any
court
has
in
passing
upon
the
question
where
you
have
a
right
of
a
state
reserved
to
it
because
it
was
a
reserved
right
as
against
a
proposition
in
which
someone
else
is
asserting.
the
federal
government
is
asserting
a
particular
right
delegated
to
it
and
the
two
rights
conflict.
it
certainly
is
a
situation
in
which
any
court
would
be
serious
in
its
decision
so
as
not
to
involve
either
of
those
rights
or
to
circumscribe
any
of
those
rights
and
finally,
they'd
--
if
they
would
have
to
circumscribe
one
right,
of
course,
you
would
have
the
proposition
of
the
factual
question
as
to
which
one
would
be
hurt
worst,
as
to
which
points
of
the
dilemma
you
took.
but
certainly,
in
a
situation
like
this,
you
do
not
have
a
situation
in
which
the
dilemma
is
of
that
consequence.
we
simply
have
a
situation
in
which
a
contractor
dealing
with
the
government
under
rules
and
regulations
and
under
congressional
enactments
in
the
building
of
an
airport
does
not
get
a
license,
but
admittedly
all
of
the
things
that
would
be
done
to
protect
the
health,
welfare
and
safety
are
provided
by
their
statutes
and
regulations.
and
then
you
have,
when
you
look
at
that
situation
as
opposed
to
that,
you
have
a
state
statute
which
by
its
very
--
by
its
very
reading
and
its
entirety
does
not
clearly
show
--
to
not
clearly
show
that
there
was
ever
any
intention
to
say
we
want
to
protect
the
--
the
federal
government
from
unscrupulous
contractors.
mr.
leffel
gentry
where
they
said
to
this
--
to
this
extent,
they
said
that
was
applicable
and
their
decision
is
binding
upon
that
proposition
and
they
have
said
that
it
was
the
intent
of
the
act
to
protect
the
government
from
unscrupulous
contractors.
this
court
though
--
mr.
leffel
gentry
yes.
well,
i
mean
for
that
when
they
said
it
was
applicable
when
they
didn't
mean
to
say
it.
it
was
applicable
and
thereby
accomplished
any
protection
of
the
local
citizens
because
without
having
done
so,
they
would
have
had
that
defense.
but
i'm
saying
when
they
go
so
far
as
to
say
it
is
applicable,
then
this
court
had
the
right
to
examine
into
the
preposition
of
whether
or
not
its
applicability
to
this
contractor
so
interfered
with
governmental
function
or
if
it
does
interfere
with
governmental
function
whether
(inaudible)
interfere
with
the
governmental
functions
on
the
one
hand
is
of
greater
consequence
than
the
depriving
the
state
of
its
right
to
exercise
its
so-called
power,
its
so-called
sovereign
power.
and
if
they
can
be
harmonized,
it
would
seem
that
it
would
be
the
duty
of
the
court
to
do
so.
mr.
leffel
gentry
well,
i'm
talking
about
the
consequences
of
whether
or
not
you
say
on
the
hand
that
the
sovereign
power
of
the
state
to
exercise
its
police
power
in
the
--
in
the
protection
of
its
public
health,
welfare
and
safety
will
be
destroyed
if
we
don't
apply
and
uphold
the
validity
of
this
act.
now,
if
you
had
to
do
that,
in
this
instance
to
do
that,
you
would
have
a
serious
question.
but
you
don't
--
you
don't
have
to
do
that.
you
don't
have
to
say
and
you
--
there
is
no
--
nothing
in
this
record
that
would
indicate
that
the
protection
of
the
public
health,
welfare
and
safety
would
not
be
amply
protected
even
though
this
statute
is
not
applied
to
this
particular
contract
dealing
with
the
government.
mr.
leffel
gentry
well,
yes.
and
i'd
say
on
the
other
side,
then
you
have
this
situation
that
if
it
--
it's
the
impact
upon
the
government.
it's
sufficient
that
it
does
not
simply
incidentally
--
incidentally
maybe
impair
the
functions
of
the
government
such
as
making
a
greater
economic
cost
or
economic
burden
on
them,
but
if
it
actually
puts
them
in
the
position
with
the
government
where
it's
in
danger
of
not
being
able
to
get
the
job
done,
then,
of
course,
the
--
the
express
power
of
the
government
to
--
to
regulate
must
--
must
take
precedence
over
this
other
power.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
leffel
gentry
no,
sir.
mr.
leffel
gentry
absolutely,
yes,
sir.
mr.
leffel
gentry
but
i'd
say
that
so
long
as
i'm
only
doing
it
for
the
government,
then
i'm
not
required
to
get
this
contract.
i
do
not
contend
that
the
act
is
not
applicable
to
me
and
to
my
client
and
it's
dealing
with
other
--
both,
rather
the
government.
mr.
leffel
gentry
yes,
sir.
that
is
in
the
stipulation,
if
i
failed
to
state
that.
mr.
leffel
gentry
what
rights?
all,
rights.
in
other
words,
the
government
has
not
accepted
territorial
jurisdiction.
mr.
leffel
gentry
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
leffel
gentry
thank
you.
