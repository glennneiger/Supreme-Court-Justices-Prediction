mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
this
case
involves
a
contract
to
construct
a
fueling
system
for
bombers
at
the
little
rock
air
force
base
in
little
rock,
arkansas,
a
property
owned
by
the
united
states,
but
where
exclusive
jurisdiction
has
not
been
taken.
the
united
--
the
corps
of
engineers
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
on
behalf
of
the
air
force
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
they'd
put
the
bailment
the
way
anybody
owns
property.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
maybe
not
quite
the
same
as
anybody
else
but
anyway
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
don't
think
it
depends
upon
that,
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
contract
in
question
was
for
a
refueling
system.
it
amounted
to
about
$1,000,000
--
$1,090,000.
bids
were
invited
from
about
126
firms.
actually,
only
16
bidders
submitted
bids
and
i
think
this
is
some
indication
as
to
the
type
of
work
that
was
involved.
it
was
a
very
particular
kind
of
work
when
--
install
this
kind
of
system
to
handle
high
test
gasoline.
sixteen
bids
were
received
and
of
these,
only
seven
were
licensed
bidders
in
--
under
the
arkansas
statute.
there
were
nine
unlicensed
bidders.
in
other
words,
if
the
united
states
had
been
limited
by
this
statute
so
that
it
could
take
only
licensed
bidders,
it
would
have
had
the
numbers
cut
down
very
materially
to
note
your
submitted
bid.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
of
the
seven
--
oh,
i
think
only
two.
i
don't
know
whether
i
get
this
or
not.
i'll
check
it
over
tonight.
but
as
i
remembered,
there
were
only
two
arkansas
firms
and
there
were
five
that
were
out
of
state.
that,
i'll
have
to
check,
though,
i'm
not
quite
sure.
now,
the
united
states
is
concerned
with
this
case,
not
because
its
contractors
are
required
to
pay
a
licensing
fee
to
the
state
of
arkansas,
nor
even
because
they
might
be
subject
to
incidental
regulation
by
the
administrative
agency
in
arkansas.
the
reason
that
we
are
concerned
is
because
we
believe
that
the
united
states
has
a
right
and
a
duty
to
select
contractors
of
its
own
choice
and
according
to
its
own
standards.
and
when
the
state
of
arkansas
attempts
to
apply
its
licensing
law
to
a
contract
between
the
united
states
and
a
contractor,
it
is
not
only
telling
the
contractor
that
you
may
not
perform
upon
this
work
unless
you
get
a
license,
it
is
in
effect
saying
to
the
united
states
that
it
may
not
fill
this
work
with
anybody
except
someone
who
meets
arkansas
standards.
and
we
believe
that
under
the
constitution,
arkansas
may
not
do
this.
mr.
john
f.
davis
even
with
respect
to
educational
qualification.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
i
do
not
base
this
on
whether
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
or
not
this
is
a
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
police
--
within
the
police
power
of
the
state.
the
arkansas
the
contractors
licensing
law,
whatever
its
purpose
falls
within
the
general
police
power
of
the
state
to
protect
the
citizens
of
the
state
in
one
way
or
another
and
i
believe
they
have
as
much
power
with
respect
to
this
kind
of
thing
as
--
as
they
would
have
under
any
other
police
power.
i
don't
--
i
do
not
distinguish
between
them.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
i'm
going
to
mention
penn
dairies.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
don't
know
the
pacific
case,
the
--
the
pacific
coast
dairies
case.
mr.
john
f.
davis
pardon?
mr.
john
f.
davis
hill
against
florida?
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
will.
i
hadn't
intended
to,
but
we
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
[laughs]
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
was
going
to
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
was
going
to
refer
to
in
re
(inaudible)
mr.
john
f.
davis
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
certainly
isn't.
actually,
this
court
has
adopted
two
general
approaches
to
these
governmental
immunity
cases.
chief
justice
marshall
in
mcculloch
against
maryland
analyzed,
posed
the
issue
as
one
of
sovereignty,
a
clash
between
two
independent
and
indeed,
he
treated
them
as
antagonistic
sovereigns
and
then
he
would
decide
the
--
the
question
on
the
basis
of
the
supremacy
clause
in
the
constitution.
justice
holmes,
on
the
other
hand,
and
i
refer
particularly
to
johnson
against
maryland,
254
u.s.51
approached
the
issue
as
one
of
adjusting
the
interest
of
two
related
sovereigns
whose
functions
overlapped
and
that
the
solution
being
to
permit
each
to
perform
insofar
as
possible
his
functions
without
undue
interference
with
the
other.
when
these
two
approaches
appear
irreconcilable
that
troubles
come.
as
for
example
in
the
recent
case
in
this
court
in
new
york
against
united
states,
where
the
question
was
the
power
of
the
united
states
to
tax
the
state
of
new
york
on
the
sale
of
mineral
waters.
but
in
this
particular
case,
i
think
that
either
chief
justice
michael
or
mr.
justice
holmes
would
have
come
up
the
same
answer.
on
the
mcculloch
against
maryland
approach,
there
can
be
no
question
that
the
duty
to
provide
for
the
national
defense
is
one
of
the
enumerated
powers
of
the
federal
government
and
there
can
be
no
question
that
the
building
of
airfields
and
the
equipping
of
airfields
which
was
involved
in
this
case
is
part
of
that
constitutional
power.
under
article
6
of
the
constitution
then,
it
is
not
possible
for
the
state
to
interfere
with
the
federal
exercise
of
this
particular
power.
on
the
other
hand,
the
power
to
license,
which
the
state
of
arkansas
insists
upon,
must
certainly
involve
the
power
to
deny
a
license;
and
the
power
to
deny
a
license
certainly
interferes
with
the
power
to
build
an
airfield.
and
therefore,
by
the
syllogism
which
justice
--
chief
justice
marshal
would
follow,
this
statute
would
be
unconstitutional.but
if
we
approach
the
problem
as
a
problem
of
adjusting,
accommodating
the
state
powers
and
the
federal
powers
so
as
to
permit
each
one
to
be
fulfilled
with
greatest
possible
extent,
here,
we
have
a
state
power,
a
state
statute
which
is
designed
to
protect
the
people,
building
things
in
arkansas,
from
being
treated
by
unreliable
contractors.
this
isn't
the
building
code.
this
isn't
the
health
or
safety
measure.
it
is
a
law
to
promote
fair
business
and
as
i
said
a
minute
ago,
i
think
this
is
a
legitimate
exercise
of
--
of
police
power
and
obviously,
the
--
the
federal
aim
to
build
and
equip
this
airfield
is
not
basically
antagonistic
to
this
state
power.
the
united
states
has
no
desire
to
employ
unreliable
contractors.
mr.
john
f.
davis
does
the
united
states?
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
yes.
yes,
indeed.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
there
are
two
ways.
the
--
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
it
does
not
have
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
does
not
have
to
take
him.
specifically,
one
--
it
does
not
have
to
take
the
lowest
bid.
it
has
to
take
--
the
standards
are
set
forth.
in
this
case,
the
bids
are
--
are
made
under
the
armed
forces
procurement
act.
the
--
and
if
the
bids
are
--are
let
by
public
advertising,
that
is
by
--
by
advertising
by
auction,
so
to
speak,
then
the
united
states
does
not
need
to
take
the
lowest
case,
but
it
takes
the
lowest
responsible
bidder
and
is
encouraged
to
determine
not
only
whether
the
man
is
--
is
capable,
but
also
certain
other
factors
as
to
his
past
experience
and
whether
it's
big
business
or
small
business,
many
factors
are
involved
in
--
in
it
and
the
united
states
makes
a
determination
on
that
basis.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
--
the
act
of
congress
--
there
isn't
any
act
of
congress
which
deals
specifically
with,
of
course,
with
this.
there
is
rather
an
authority
that
the
armed
forces
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
it
does.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
that
--
that
is
basically
the
question
when
you
--
whether
the
state
--
whether
the
state
law
is
intended
and
we
have
here
a
finding,
of
course,
by
the
--
by
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
that
it
is
intended
to
--
to
apply
to
this
case.
but
that
is
a
problem
for
this
court
to
decide,
to
reconcile
what
appear
to
be
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
has
been
held
that
they
can
employ
them.
that
is
that
--
that
is
--
even
the
state
of
arkansas,
the
--
the
supreme
court
in
--
of
arkansas
in
this
particular
case
recognizes
the
right
of
doing
--
of
the
veterans
administration
to
employ
unlicensed
surgeons.
there
--
there
can
be
no
--
no
question
about
that
kind
of
--
about
that
kind
of
--
of
problem.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
have
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
they
would
if
we
didn't
have
such
cases
as
penn
dairies
and
some
others
that
we
have
to
reconcile
with
the
position
that
we
have
here
and
--
but
the
--
the
line
of
cases
in
this
court
has
gone
--
has
gone
further
and
further
along
the
--
the
line
of
where
the
state
power
doesn't
impinge,
doesn't
prevent
this
--
the
--
the
federal
government
from
carrying
out
its
functions
permitting
insofar
as
possible
the
--
the
state
power
to
continue.
the
--
the
approach
which
you
suggest
is
the
--
is
the
approach
which
is
followed
in
many
other
cases
which
i
describe
as
the
mcculloch
against
maryland
approach
and
which
is
--
sees
as
black
and
white
this
question
of
the
sovereignty
and
this
is
within
the
powers
of
the
united
states.
the
-
the
united
states
has
determined
that
this
is
what
should
be
done
and
the
state
can
do
nothing
to
interfere
with
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
then
--
then
the
--
the
article
6
of
the
constitution
takes
over
and
the
laws
--
the
constitution
and
laws
are
supreme
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
under
--
under
the
constitution.
and
that
--
that
is
--
that
is
the
way
we
must
determine
if
we
find
that
there's
a
conflict.
what
this
court
has
done
in
some
cases
is
define
that
the
two
laws
can
be
reconciled
and
really,
that
is
the
--
that
is
the
question
before
this
court
whether
they
can
be
reconciled
so
that
both
can
--
both
can
be
--
can
be
enforced.
and
we
feel
that
that
cannot
be
done
in
this
case
that
actually
the
--
the
state
law
is
irreconcilable
with
the
--
with
the
federal
powers
in
--
in
this
situation.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
is
a
reason
your
honor.
the
reason
is
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
of
course.
the
reason
is
that
we
have
not
taken
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
--
of
the
--
of
the
(inaudible)
but
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
well,
that
is
true
but
we
can
get
no
--
no
help
from
pacific
dairies
because
here
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
because
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
is
that
language
in
the
statute.
i
--
i
--
it
does
not
sound
reasonable.
that
--
that
sounds
presumptuous.
i
mean,
i
could
--
i
could
criticize
the
reasoning
that
it
doesn't
affect
the
united
states
because
it
applies
only
to
the
other
parties
of
the
contract.
i
think
it
apply
--
that
it
does
affect
both
the
united
states
and
the
contracting
party.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
both
--
there's
a
very
real
difference
in
the
factual
situation
because
there,
they
can
get
their
milk
from
these
people
that
they
choose.
there
is
an
economic
burden
on
the
united
states
to
be
sure.
it
costs
more
money
to
buy
the
milk
but
they
can
buy
the
milk
from
whomever
they
choose,
and
the
court
treated
the
restriction
as
this
--
in
the
same
way
that
it
would
treat
a
non-discriminatory
tax
as
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
--
that
is
right.
and
it
didn't
--
it
didn't
fundamentally
interfere
with
--
with
the
--
with
the
procurement
in
that
case.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
i
may
say
with
respect
to
pacific
coast
dairies
that
if
there
were
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
this
--
if
the
government
had
taken
jurisdiction
so
the
state
law
no
longer
applied
to
this
air
field,
it
might
well
strengthen
our
case.
it
might
--
it
might
make
it
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
--
i
think
in
this
case
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
have
no
more
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
nothing
to
add
unless
there's
some
more
questions,
your
honor.
