mr.
gentry.
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
we
--
can
we
say,
mr.
gentry,
as
a
matter
of
law
that
this
licensing
law
does
not
protect
among
other
people
the
workmen
who
are
on
these
jobs,
under
the
contract,
employment
contract.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
in
some
of
these
licensing
laws
like
that,
they
have
them
in
part
because
contractors
didn't
pay
their
--
their
health
and
--
and
work
responsible
in
some
instances
so
far
as
payment
was
concerned
in
the
treatment
of
their
employees
and
--
and
other
considerations
of
that
kind.
chief
justice
earl
warren
my
point
is
that
employees
do
deal
with
the
contractor.
chief
justice
earl
warren
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
yes,
that's
what
i
had
in
mind.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
federal
safety
regulations
apply
to
a
job
of
this
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
federal
safety
regulations
apply
to
a
job
of
this
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
provision
in
the
act
for
a
temporary
permit
or
anything
of
that
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
have
any
issue
here
other
than
the
burden
that
this
places
upon
the
government
itself?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
this
was
that
you
were
going
in
this
airport
for
private
individual,
you
would
--
you
would
be
obliged
to
do
this
switching.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
leslie
miller,
incorporated,
appellant,
versus
state
of
arkansas.
mr.
smith.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may
do
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
smith.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
distinction,
mr.
smith,
between
the
government's
use
of
this
unlicensed
--
this
unlicensed
contractor
on
the
one
hand
and
its
use
of
unlicensed
architects
or
engineers,
doctors,
veterinarians,
or
any
other
licensed
group
but
that
the
state
didn't
variably
does
license?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
it
might
--
might
not
be
an
employee
of
the
government,
it
might
make
that
contract
with
an
architect
to
draft
--
to
design
a
building.
they
might
make
a
contract
with
a
health
service
to
perform
services
for
the
indians
or
for
veterans
or
for
some
--
or
for
some
other
group
from
the
state.
it
might
employ
--
not
employ
but
make
contract
with
veterinarians
to
render
some
service
to
the
farmers
of
the
state
would
--
do
they
apply
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
smith,
there
was
one
thing
that
--
that
bothered
me
here
and
that
is
that
your
--
your
law
apparently
not
only
requires
them
to
have
this
license
in
order
to
transact
in
the
contracting
business
but
it
also
requires
them
to
have
the
license
at
the
time
they
bid.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
if
the
government
calls
for
bids
on
--
on
a
large
or
on
any
project
and
it
has
--
a
contractor
isn't
licensed,
he
has
to
wait
either
until
one
of
the
semiannual
meetings
of
your
--
your
board
or
the
board
has
to
hold
a
special
meeting
for
him
and
he
must
give
30
days
notice
before
for
that
meeting.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
--
now,
many
government
contracts
i
--
i
think
will
--
will
provide
for
letting
the
contract
within
the
30
days.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
that
--
that
would
mean
that
there
was
a
burden
on
the
government
at
least
to
--
to
the
extent
that
they
could
not
consider
such
contractor.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
--
and
you
don't
think
that
that
is
an
undue
burden
on
the
government.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
mr.
smith,
one
of
the
things
that
bothers
me
is
apparently
congress
has
picked
some
standards
for
the
award
of
bids
to
responsible
bidders.
it
was
determined
what
a
responsible
bidder
is
and
this
character,
reputation,
ability
and
experience
and
so
forth.
now,
when
it
--
when
it
determines
to
do
that,
is
it
not
in
so
doing
excluding
the
right
of
the
state
to
determine
who
is
qualified
by
reason
of
experience,
character
and
--
and
so
forth?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you,
mr.
smith.
mr.
davis,
do
you
have
some
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
rebuttal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
