justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
take
the
same
position
if
this
was
a
plumbing
contractor?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
take
the
same
position
if
this
was
a
plumbing
contractor?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
any
history
of
any
mischief
at
which
this
statute
was
seen
in
arkansas?
has
there
been
any
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
sounds
--
that
sounds
like
unethical
practices
of
the
contractors
other
than
arkansas
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
--
no
intimation
to
what
those
unethical
practices
were?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
that
actually
this
was
aimed
at
holding
all
of
business
they
could
for
arkansas
contractors,
to
keep
out
of
the
state
contractors
away?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
kind
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
kind
of
jurisdiction
was
taken,
none
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
you
wouldn't
think
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
think,
mr.
davis,
that
whether
or
not
or
rather
if
the
government
had
taken
exclusive
jurisdiction,
this
case
would
be
stronger
than
the
one
you're
presenting?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
smith,
may
i
ask?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
know
if
it's
in
your
brief
but
i
--
the
brief
of
the
appellant
at
page
33,
section
5
of
what
appears
to
be
an
amendment,
i
gather,
of
the
1939
act
says
that,
(inaudible)
the
purpose
to
prevent
unfair
competition
and
delay
in
construction
while
they
needed
facilities
apprehending
an
increase
in
construction
business
in
a
vast
influx
of
contractors
from
other
sections.‚Äù
now
i
would
have
read
into
that
any
limitation
upon
purpose
of
this
legislation
generally?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
smith
i
noticed
that
section
9
of
your
act,
i
gather
it's
the
one
still
operative
which
establishes
the
standards
for
judgment
whether
a
license
shall
or
shall
not
issue.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
speaks
of
experience,
ability,
character,
the
manner
of
performance
of
previous
contracts,
financial
condition,
equipment,
any
other
fact
tending
to
show
ability
and
willingness
to
conserve
the
public
health
and
safety
and
therefore
complying
with
the
provisions
of
this
act.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
as
to
the
first
--
now
perhaps
as
to
all,
it's
the
last
two,
don't
the
government
regulations
require
the
inquiry
of
the
contracting
officer
to
be
made
upon
the
same
standards
because
looking
at
page
49
of
the
government's
brief,
the
ones
that
mr.
justice
clark
referred
to,
financial
resources
necessary
experience
and
so
forth,
i
think
pretty
much
the
same
thing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
what
--
what's
--
what's
the
case
then
when
there's
a
difference
of
view
as
between
the
state
board
and
the
contract
--
federal
contracting
officer
on
each
of
those
requirements.
i
gather
your
position
is
that
nevertheless
the
state
board's
determination
must
control.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
view
the
procurement
regulations
which
of
course
i
gather
are
conceded
to
have
been
enacted
pursuant
the
statute
have
the
same
effect
as
the
congress
had
acted
in
this
regard
as
to
qualification
of
the
contractors.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
the
board
have
regulations
as
to
the
qualifications
of
those
who
come
in?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
contractor
x
wanted
to
go
into
arkansas,
he
wouldn't
know
what
qualities
he
has
to
have.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
mr.
smith,
this
is
--
this
is
confined
isn't
it
to
general
contractors
as
it
is
defined.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
tell
me
is
the
composition
of
the
board
as
originally
provided
in
section
2
limited
to
general
contractors
of
certain
experience
and
residents
in
arkansas?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
by
the
reason
of
the
amendment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
looking
at
page
21
again
of
the
appellant's
brief,
section
2,
same
setup
that
each
must
be
at
least
35
years
old
and
a
general
contractor
not
less
than
10
years
of
experience
and
responsible
charge
of
construction
projects
of
magnitude
consistent
with
the
duties
of
his
office.
