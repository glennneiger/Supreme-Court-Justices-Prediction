justice
felix
frankfurter
but
why
not?
in
that
case,
we
have
held
that
they
should
even
post
the
condition
(inaudible)
appellant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
going
to
carry
that
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
a
state
can
make
it
a
condition
(inaudible)
because
he
is
the
appellant
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
--
have
you
vindicated
mr.
davis,
it's
not
an
element
here
once
didn't
have
in
here
(inaudible)
namely,
here,
you
have
impingement
directly
upon
the
operations
of
federal
government
and
not
merely
the
accommodation
between
two
statutes
which
may
affect
other
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
is
direct
from
the
united
states
is
it
directly
found
that
this
case
you
also
have
to
have
much
difficulty
in
reconciling
penn
dairies
--
penn
dairies
and
all
those
other
cases
(inaudible)
showdown.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
davis,
before
you
sit
down
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
wholly
respecting
your
choice
of
not
--
not
citing
cases
to
which
you
are
familiar,
if
it's
(inaudible)
why
you
didn't
cite
hill
against
florida.
i
noticed
you
don't
refer
to
the
pacific
case
and
go
to
some
extent,
there
is
some
trouble
in
furnishing
penn
dairies,
i
should
think
your
case
is
so
much
more
like
pacific
dairy
than
penn
dairies.
but
there
must
be
some
reason
why
you
didn't
cite
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
exclusive?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
know,
but
i
mean
the
way
the
court
talked
about
what
penn
dairies
(inaudible)
specifically
showed
the
limited
scope
of
that
doctrine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
we
can
get
--
well,
all
right,
give
me
your
explanation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
penn
dairies
went
on
the
ground
that
it
--
it
didn't
buy
these
contracting
authorities,
the
army
people
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
referring
more
particularly
at
all
to
the
penn
dairies
unlike
this
case,
it
wasn't
required
that
the
agents,
officials
of
the
united
states
were
restricted
or
rather
impliedly,
it
was
argued
that
they
were
allowed,
that
they
were
free
and
not
subject
to
such
restriction
that
pennsylvania
invoked.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words
the
--
one
of
the
considerations
you'd
allow
it
on,
a
different
type
of
those
cases
like
what
are
the
considerations.
i
think,
the
importance
was
that
there
wasn't
a
description.
but
you
didn't
have
to
get
the
cheapest
milk
and
therefore
it's
fair
to
argue
that
uncle
sam
wanting
to
get
particularly
this
purchase
of
milk
as
well
as
the
other
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
conflict
would
arise
if
a
man
is
treated
a
supply
(inaudible)
then
it
doesn't
restrict
him
to
say
it's
free
to
buy
--
you
must
buy
from
--
that
there's
an
advantage,
a
public
advantage
in
buying
from
(inaudible)
the
more
certified
regulated
milk,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
reason
i
don't
feel
like
you
do
about
it
is
because
to
me
exclusively
my
dissent
is
clear,
didn't
solve
the
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
--
i'm
--
i'm
always
--
that
you
are
concerned
with
the
duties
of
the
court
and
not
their
qualifications,
unsuccessful
qualifications
upon
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
question
before
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
not
to
confront
it
with
the
problem
of
striking
down
this
law,
the
problem
before
us
is
this
restriction
on
uncle
sam
himself
is
concerned.
with
the
--
merely
in
the
words.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
is
--
they're
not
offering
that
as
applied
position
of
the
law,
then
congress
would
say
in
(inaudible)
well
this
court
i
suppose
is,
i
don't
know
why.
probably
a
hundred
cases
certainly
at
the
beginning
of
time,
i
can
say
that
they
started
in
which
this
court
has
stricken
down
state
legislation
because
of
the
implied
contract
with
some
overriding
federal
authority.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
you
can
tax
the
contractors
where
their
money
it
makes
out
of
uncle
sam.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
different
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
by
the
record.
does
it
appear
whether
it
is
contracted
by
the
--
exclusive,
the
government
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
you
got
him
whenever
it
is
local
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
he
does
exclusively,
the
government,
can
it,
in
any
--
essentially
within
the
johnson
case.
(inaudible)
also
has
in
local
business,
we
get
them
under
local
business.
all
the
segregation
argument
is
covered
by
that
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
would
you
say
if
--
if
this
--
if
an
arkansas
contractor
restricts
himself,
the
government
would
--
would
that
be
a
different
case
from
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
(inaudible)
seen
as
a
matter
of
choice.
this
fellow
says,
â€œi'd
only
--
i
like
the
word
conversant,
for
various
reasons,
i'm
(inaudible)
paint
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
on
united
states
government
job.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
thought
you
just
(inaudible)
the
johnson
case
on
the
ground
that
he's
only
working
for
uncle
sam.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
that
it
would,
knowing
that
they
still
are
but
certainly
at
the
date
of
my
youth,
there
were
people
who
didn't
(inaudible)
for
the
united
states
with
contractors
and
not
have
been
(inaudible)
in
--
in
the
(inaudible)
there
were
contractors,
they
wouldn't
be
subject
to
--
they
wouldn't
be
subject
to
local
law.
they
would
put
out
--
i
thought
it
must
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
suggesting
that
you're
not
--
if
congress
really
told
that
it's
mine,
that's
why
i
gave
up
trying
to
find
out
what
the
intention
of
congress
is.
if
congress
tells
it's
mine
in
english
then
there's
no
problem.
the
problem
is
when
it
doesn't
tell
us,
it
doesn't
know
exactly
because
it
has
any
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
either
way,
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
put
the
fact
there's
a
general
--
and
i
think
this
is
relevant
in
my
defense.
i'm
sure
on
the
showing
that
this
describes
a
general
problem,
that's
a
different
story
from
what
i
understand
and
when
uncle
sam
didn't
reach
the
choice
that
he's
--
that
he
would
be
doing
direct
government
work
by
what
the
state
wants.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
suggest
another
question
of
--
to
this
problem.
it
has
been
suggested
that
this
presents
you
--
i
noticed
(inaudible)
often
exclusively
the
civilization
of
the
industry
(inaudible)
this
may
be
also
protective
of
the
employee
to
a
certain
deal
after
--
you're
holding
of
the
people
(inaudible)
government
could
interpret
speculations,
i
suggest
that
uncle
sam
may
be
aware
of
the
facts
that
sometimes
licensing
agencies
in
different
states
are
not
(inaudible)
but
licensing
agencies
have
been
known
to
play
favorites.
that's
not
unknown
in
the
history
of
licensing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
government
speculate
as
to
what
mischief
maybe
done,
somewhat
evil
or
(inaudible)
and
uncle
sam
ought
to
be
subject
to
that
kind
of
favorite
play
licensing.
