mr.
william
j.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
considering
the
application
of
hill
against
florida
to
the
present
case,
it
should
be
noted
that
the
issue
there
was
one
of
the
supremacy
of
federal
law
under
the
commerce
clause
with
a
conflicting
state
law
rather
than
strictly
one
of
sovereign
immunity.
here,
we
have
the
same
issue
of
the
supremacy
of
federal
law
over
state
law
but
it
is
reenforced
in
this
case
by
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity.
i
think
what
i
say
can
be
made
clear
by
referring
to
two
other
cases.
i
think
the
closest
case
to
our
present
one
on
its
facts
is
johnson
against
maryland
in
254
united
states
51.
there,
the
specific
question
was
whether
or
not
the
post
office
department
was
limited
in
hiring
drivers
to
deliver
mail
in
maryland
to
individuals
who
had
been
licensed
by
the
state
of
maryland
to
drive
motor
vehicles
in
that
state.
and
mr.
justice
holmes
speaking
for
the
court
found
that
the
post
office
department
should
not
be
limited
in
its
choice
of
drivers
of
its
mail
trucks
to
those
who
had
been
licensed
by
the
state
of
maryland.
now
on
the
other
hand
the
--
the
case
which
really
gives
us
the
--
the
greatest
difficulty
is
the
penn
dairies
case.
there,
the
question
was
the
application
of
the
pennsylvania
law
which
imposed
a
minimum
price
on
the
sale
of
milk
in
pennsylvania,
the
application
of
this
law,
the
transactions
between
a
pennsylvania
dairy
and
the
united
states
which
was
buying
milk
for
use
in
--
in
army
camp.
the
court
held
that
the
minimum
price
requirement
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania
was
applicable.
it
did
so
by
treating
this
case
in
the
same
light
as
it
would
have
treated
a
case
of
a
non-discriminatory
tax
which
is
imposed
upon
an
agency
of
the
united
states
and
where
there
is
quite
a
line
of
cases
now
holding
that
as
long
as
the
--
as
the
tax
is
non-discriminatory,
it
may
be
imposed
even
though
there
is
an
additional
economic
burden
on
the
united
states
by
reason
of
the
tax.
reasoning
from
this
basis
the
court
said,
that
this
did
not
interfere
in
effect,
it
didn't
really
interfere
with
the
united
states
procurement
of
milk.
it
added
an
economic
burden
to
it.
it
made
--
it
may
have
caused
the
united
states
more
to
buy
its
milk
but
it
didn't
really
interfere,
it
wasn't
inconsistent
with
it.
and
that
the
additional
economic
burden
was
well
merely
one
of
those
burdens
which
is
the
price
of
paying
that
we
have
to
pay
by
having
a
dual
sovereignty.
mr.
william
j.
smith
that's
right.
that
was
one
of
the
tax
cases
itself.
that
was
a
tax
case.
mr.
william
j.
smith
now,
in
this
--
in
the
penn
dairies
case,
there
is
--
there
is
another
distinction
between
this
and
the
penn
dairies
case.
in
that
case,
it
was
specifically
recognized
that
if
congress
had
desired
to
remove
this
activity
from
the
field
of
state
regulation,
congress
would
have
had
the
power
to
have
said
so
and
that
if
it
had
its
law
would
have
been
supreme
that
it
would
have
removed
it
from
--
from
the
state
law.
now,
that's
important
in
this
case
because
it
comes
down
to
the
second
leg
of
our
argument
namely,
that
here,
congress,
through
the
armed
services
procurement
act
and
the
regulations
which
have
been
adopted
pursuant
to
it,
congress
has
legislated
with
respect
to
this
type
of
procurement
in
a
way
which
excludes
the
state
from
regulating
it
at
the
same
time.
i
--
i
don't
mean
by
this
that
congress
has
said,
"the
state
shall
not
regulate
procurement."
i
don't
think
that
penn
dairies
means
that
there
should
be
a
--
a
necessarily
an
outright
statement
to
that
but
what
--
what
appears
here
is
that
the
legislation
which
has
been
enacted
by
congress
is
so
inclusive,
so
pervasive
that
it
would
be
inconsistent
to
believe
that
congress
could
believe
that
the
states
could
regulate
it
at
the
same
time.
the
armed
services
procurement
act
or
pertinent
portions
of
it
are
set
forth
in
--
in
our
brief
beginning
in
--
in
the
appendix,
beginning
at
page
46.
and
that
with
respect
to
this
type
of
--
with
respect
to
this
type
of
contract,
which
is
a
contract
which
is
placed
by
advertising,
it
is
provided
and
i'm
reading
from
page
49
of
our
brief,
section
3
(b),
"all
bids
shall
be
publicly
opened
at
the
time
and
place
stated
in
the
advertisement.
awards
shall
be
made
with
reasonable
promptness
by
written
notice
to
that
responsible
bidder
whose
bid
conforming
to
the
invitations
of
bids
shall
be
found
most
advantageous
to
the
government,
price
and
other
factors
considered.‚Äù
this
vest
in
the
contracting
officers
in
this
case
the
corps
of
engineers,
the
discretion
to
determine
which
bid
is
most
advantageous
to
the
government
and
they
in
turn
are
guided
by
the
regulations
which
are
set
forth
in
the
pages
which
follow
as
to
what
consideration
shall
be
given
--
shall
be
taken
into
consideration
in
determining
which
is
the
most
advantageous
bid.
the
act
itself
gives
--
gives
some
guidance.
for
example
in
the
first
--
in
section
2
of
the
act,
there's
a
provision
that
in
entering
into
such
contracts,
consideration
shall
be
given
to
protecting
small
business.
this
then
would
be
one
of
the
considerations
which
would
have
to
be
considered
in
determining
which
bid
should
be
accepted.
now
in
order
to
make
concrete
for
this
court
to
be
--
the
type
of
--
the
way
these
two
laws
would
conflict,
i
think
it
be
interesting
to
--
to
note
the
application
in
this
particular
case.
in
this
case,
bids
were
invited
from
126
firms
and
bids
were
received
from
16
bidders
and
mr.
justice
brennan,
there
was
only
one
of
those
that
was
located
in
--
in
arkansas.
of
the
16
bidders,
seven
only
were
licensed
by
arkansas
and
nine
were
non-licensed.
the
engineers
in
going
over
the
bids
determined
that
leslie
miller
was
the
best,
most
advantageous,
responsible
bidder.
it
was
not
licensed.
if
--
if
the
corps
of
the
engineers
had
been
governed
by
the
arkansas
statute,
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
sift
through
these
16
bidders
and
to
--
to
take
first
the
one
that
was
most
advantageous,
leslie
miller
wasn't
licensed
and
go
down
through
the
list
until
it
found
one
that
was
licensed.
now
obviously,
this
is
substituting
for
the
discretion
of
the
--
of
the
corp
of
engineers
as
governed
by
the
law
and
the
regulations.
it's
--
it's
substituting
a
judgment
of
the
state
of
arkansas
as
to
who
should
be
licensed
and
who
is
licensed.
and
that
i
believe
is
a
direct
conflict
which
--
which
shows
that
the
two
laws
cannot
in
--
in
effect
live
together
and
that
in
that
case
the
federal
law
should
be
given
the
supremacy
which
is
required
by
article
6
of
the
constitution.
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
--
and
go
on
amicus
curiae,
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
reserve
time
for
--
for
rebuttal
if
this
would
be
agreeable
to
mr.
davis.
mr.
william
j.
smith
may
it
please
the
court.
i
don't
recall
what
the
issue
in
this
case
at
all.
i
think
the
issue
is
clear.
i
think
the
issue
can
be
taken
from
penn
dairies
as
cited
by
or
as
stated
by
this
court
in
its
opinion
in
penn
dairies.
there
he
said
since
the
constitution
had
left
congress
free
to
set
aside
local
taxation
and
regulation
of
government
contractors
which
burdened
the
national
government,
we
see
no
basis
for
implying
from
the
constitutional
alone
a
restriction
of
all
certain
regulations
which
congress
has
not
seen
fit
to
impose
unless
the
regulations
are
shown
to
be
inconsistent
with
congressional
policy
citing
cases
and
continuing.
our
inquiry
here
therefore
must
be
whether
the
state
regulation
of
this
contract
in
a
matter
of
local
concern,
conflicts
with
congressional
legislation
or
with
any
desirable
congressional
policy.
i
agree
100%
that
that's
the
issue
in
this
case.
we
think
that
congress
has
created
a
framework
of
legislation
for
the
letting
of
these
contracts,
these
construction
contracts
and
other
types
of
contracts
but
--
but
particularly
a
construction
contract
within
the
framework
of
these
state
regulatory
laws
and
the
reason
i
say
these
state
because
approximately
one
half
of
the
states
have
a
similar
law.
now,
before
proceeding
further
with
the
--
with
the
issues
on
the
law,
i
would
like
to
give
some
background
in
view
of
the
argument
yesterday
as
to
the
purpose
of
this
law
or
certainly
to
say
that
these
laws
have
only
for
their
purpose
the
protection
of
the
owner
who
deals
with
the
contractor
as
a
fallacious
argument.
these
laws
seek
to
protect
the
--
the
state
assets,
the
people
assets,
the
welfare
and
the
health
of
the
people.
the
construction
industry
is
one
of
the
most
important
segments
of
the
industry
of
any
state
or
the
economy
of
any
state
and
to
stabilize
the
construction
and
receive
one
of
the
purposes
of
this
law
and
now
the
states
have
followed
the
same
procedure
in
enacting
similar
laws.
this
law
has
been
on
the
statute
books
in
arkansas
since
1939.
there's
never
been
one
case
cited
to
you
or
one
instance
where
this
board
has
tried
to
be
arbitrary
or
tried
to
keep
outsiders
out
of
the
state
of
arkansas
or
tried
to
use
it
for
any
improper
motive
elements
and
to
accomplish
the
purposes
of
the
law
and
that's
to
stabilize
the
construction
industry
within
the
borders
of
arkansas.
mr.
william
j.
smith
yes.
mr.
william
j.
smith
i
quite
agree
with
you
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
unless
congress
has
specifically
prohibited
such
regulation
such
as
it
has
done
in
the
atomic
energy
act
passed
upon
by
this
court
in
carson
v.
roane-anderson,
cited
in
our
brief,
then
that
restriction
has
not
been
laid
upon
the
states.
mr.
william
j.
smith
i
--
i
quite
agree
with
that
purpose,
yes.
and
if
there
the
implied
conflict
here
with
congressional
enactment
or
congressional
policy
then
the
state
law
must
follow.
it
should
be
my
purpose
to
show
that
there's
no
conflict
for
instance
there
has
no
standard
form
of
contract
adopted
for
construction
contracts
cited
in
our
brief
at
page
10,
united
states
standard
form
contract
on
title
41
in
the
appendix,
41,
section
54413
provided
in
part,
article
10,
"permits
and
responsibility
for
work,
the
contractor
shall,
without
additional
expense
to
the
government
obtain
all
required
licenses
and
permits."
now
congress
in
other
instances
and
i
think
that
it's
fair
to
assume
that
that
is
an
--
is
one
way
to
get
at
the
intention
of
congress.
it
has
provided
for
special
immunity
of
its
contractors
and
of
course
this
court
has
held
that
contractors
do
not
or
not
close
with
the
immunity
of
the
government
by
reason
of
the
relationship
between
the
government
and
the
contractors.
now
--
mr.
william
j.
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
j.
smith
we
read
the
cases
to
state
taxation
and
regulations
as
to
that.
if
we're
in
error
in
that
connection,
we
might
be.
we
think
that
this
article
10
in
the
standard
form
must
mean
something.
it
specifically
provides
for
the
obtaining
of
permits
and
licenses.
what
else
does
it
mean?
in
--
in
the
morgan
case
cited
in
our
brief,
morgan
versus
the
state
of
arkansas
for
the
use
of
benefit
of
philips
county,
appeal
was
dismissed
by
this
case
citing
the
--
the
stewart
case
which
an
out-of-state
contractor
came
in,
did
not
comply
with
the
laws
regulating
corporations.
they're
doing
their
business
by
corporations,
perform
the
contract
for
the
government
and
the
white
river
levee
district,
suit
was
brought,
a
penalty
was
laid.
it
was
appealed
to
this
court
and
the
appeal
was
dismissed.
on
the
ground,
there
was
no
substantial
federal
question.
here,
there
has
been
no
interference
with
the
work.
a
penalty
has
been
laid
on
this
contractor
for
violating
the
state
law.
the
appeal
is
here.
frankly,
we
don't
distinguish
the
cases.
mr.
william
j.
smith
morgan
--
if
you
please,
it's
relied
upon
by
the
supreme
court
and
it
was
cited
in
our
--
here
it
is,
e.e.
morgan
company,
incorporated,
versus
state,
use
and
benefit
of
phillips
county,
202
arkansas,
404,
150
s.w.2d
736
and
i'm
sorry
i'm
quoting
from
the
supreme
court's
decision
there.
we
do
not
have
your
citation.
i
believe
it's
314
u.s.
mr.
william
j.
smith
i
--
i
think
that
the
distinction
is
that
in
those
cases,
those
professional
cases,
the
government
only
is
affected.
now
in
the
case
of
the
johnson
v.
maryland,
it
was
cited
a
few
moments
ago,
there
is
a
government
employee.
and
the
government
is
responsible
in
that
case
for
its
employee.
our
state
statute
specifically
exempts
under
section
15
and
that
may
be
found
in
appellant
brief
at
page
28,
i
believe.
our
state
statute
specifically
exempts
authorized
representatives
of
the
government.
mr.
william
j.
smith
the
way
we
meet
that
issue
in
this
case,
your
honor,
is
we
turn
back
to
the
apparent
intent
of
congress.
mr.
william
j.
smith
because
in
this
case,
they
have
adopted
a
standard
form
providing
that
permits
and
licenses
will
be
obtained
by
the
contractor.
they
can
afford
a
representative.
there
are
ways
to
accomplish
what
the
government
seeks
to
accomplish
without
striking
down
the
state
law.
now
in
the
case
of
an
architect,
it
may
be
different
and
we
find
nothing
in
the
regulations
that
shows
that
that
problem
has
been
considered
and
any
provision
has
been
made
for
where
here
we
didn't
find
a
specific
regulation
providing
for
permits
and
licenses
and
that's
the
only
distinction
i
can
find.
mr.
william
j.
smith
article
10,
you'll
find
it
in
appellee's
brief,
your
honor
at
--
at
page
10,
article
10
on
the
--
next
to
the
last
paragraph
in
the
appellee's
brief.
mr.
william
j.
smith
sir?
mr.
william
j.
smith
i
would
assume
it
would,
yes,
sir.
now,
after
--
i
don't
know
what
permit
and
license
it
could
refer
to
other
than
to
a
state
permit
or
state
license.
mr.
william
j.
smith
pardon?
mr.
william
j.
smith
oh,
yes,
mr.
justice
clark.
we
have
any
number
of
local
and
state
regulations
affecting
the
building
industry.
i
--
i'd
speak
for
arkansas
alone
because
i've
studied
those.
we
know
that
they're
uniform
throughout
the
state
usually.
we
have
a
general
contractor's
license.
we
have
a
master
plumber's
license
on
the
state
level,
a
local
plumber
license
on
the
local
level.
we
have
electrician's
licenses
required.
all
of
these
are
laid
in
the
police
power
to
the
state
for
the
health
and
welfare
and
they
involved
important
functions
so
far
as
society
is
concern.
now,
i
would
like
to
reach
the
argument
made
yesterday
that
this
law
could
not
have
been
intended
to
affect
workmen,
the
safety
of
employees
or
it
would
not
have
been
the
$20,000
requirement
put
in.
well
again,
i
--
i
don't
agree
with
that
premise
at
all
because
the
magnitude
of
the
work
to
be
regulated
is
one
of
the
important
things
we
all
know
that
our
workmen's
compensation
law
of
course
at
some
states
they
have
three
employees,
some
five,
some
eight.
one
state
i
remember
kentucky
as
high
as
14
under
certain
industries.
it's
the
overall
impact
upon
the
community
and
there
why
--
if
a
general
contractor
or
contractor
has
a
contract
of
less
than
$20,000,
the
state
has
decided
and
when
the
law
was
originally
written,
it
was
$10,000.
it
was
amended
to
go
to
$20,000
in
view
of
inflation
because
a
project
costing
less
then
that
and
it
maybe
a
building
downtown
as
well
as
out
on
an
air
field,
there
are
passersby,
there
--
there
are
citizens
going
and
coming
on
the
sidewalks,
on
the
streets
near,
there
are
employees
on
the
job,
there
are
material
men
dealing
with
the
contractors,
there
are
subcontractors
dealing
with
it.
an
argument
may
be
there
that
we
have
the
miller
act
on
federal
projects.
it
may
be
argued
that
we
have
the
miiler
act
but
we
all
agree
that
the
miller
act
doesn't
protect
everybody
in
every
sense,
we
don't
even
had
an
argument
before
this
court
yesterday
that
it
was
not
reaching
one
of
the
problems
of
the
workmen
on
their
welfare
fund.
so
we
say
that
congress
has
not
specifically
legislated
in
this
field
and
has
not
legislated
in
the
field
to
such
an
extent
as
to
imply
that
this
law
is
in
conflict
with
congressional
enactments.
mr.
william
j.
smith
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
william
j.
smith
no,
sir.
i
think
that's
read
fairly
well
and
there's
a
history
behind
those
emergency
clauses.
we
know
that
many
times
they
were
drawn
very
loosely.
that's
an
emergency
clause
in
order
that
the
act
may
go
into
effect
consigned
by
the
government
otherwise
it
would
have
been
120
days
after
the
government
signed
it.
and
the
emergency
clause
is
not
usually
digested.
in
this
case,
i
would
look
in
back
to
see
the
emergency
clause
to
the
original
act
and
if
you
look
on
page
30,
there
is
an
emergency
clause
there.
section
22
to
the
original
act
and
it's
accustomed
to
track
this
emergency
clauses
on
to
legislation
in
order
to
put
them
into
effect
and
we
--
we've
had
many
emergency
clauses
of
course
attacked
and
in
that
case
they
fall
unless
they
measure
up
to
the
requirements
of
an
emergency
clause.
we
don't
think
that
this
emergency
clause
can
be
taken
to
fairly
state
the
scope
of
the
law.
this
--
mr.
william
j.
smith
yes.
mr.
william
j.
smith
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
smith
yes.
mr.
william
j.
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
j.
smith
i
would
like
to
meet
that
issue
--
mr.
william
j.
smith
--
in
this
manner,
if
you
please,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
j.
smith
we
think
that
that
is
some
burden.
we
also
think
that
congress
can
remove
that
burden
anytime
it
wants
to
just
as
it
did
in
the
atomic
energy
act.
now,
the
mere
fact
that
there
is
some
burden
as
been
held
by
this
court
is
not
sufficient
to
strike
the
law
down.
now
--
now
what
is
that
burden
in
this
particular
case?
the
government
has
agreed
that
the
board
meets
on
an
average
of
18
times
a
year
even
though
the
loan
it
requires
to
meet
in
february
and
august,
there
is
no
showing
that
anyone
has
a
difficulty
in
getting
an
audience
with
the
board
or
getting
the
application
passed
upon.
now,
in
addition
to
that
and
that's
been
the
long
time
history
and
certainly
this
appellant
here
represented
by
a
corporate
counsel,
i
believe
they
would
erase
every
defense
they
could
have.
but
there'd
been
no
showing
of
any
abuse
of
discretion
or
any
attempt
to
restrict
in
that
manner.
now,
one
of
these
government
projects,
this
particular
airport
for
instance
to
give
a
background
and
i'm
going
outside
the
record
but
i'm
sure
there'll
be
no
objection.
the
people
of
that
community
raised
money
over
a
period
of
six
or
eight
months
and
brought
this
property
and
gave
it
to
the
government.
we
were
anxious
to
get
the
government
in
there
and
contrary
to
some
remarks
in
the
brief
with
my
opposing
counsel
we're
not
trying
to
keep
the
government
out
of
arkansas
a
construction
now.we
are
happy
to
have
all
the
construction
they'll
give
us.
but
these
contractors
knew
that
this
project
was
coming
up.six
of
the
seven
that
were
licensed
came
in
there
and
qualified.
there
is
no
showing
it
could
not
--
not
have
qualified
or
there
was
any
unreasonable
requirements
or
any
attempt
to
keep
him
from
qualifying.
now
of
course
when
you
say
--
and
--
and
the
very
fact
that
136
invitations
were
sent
out
to
show
that
it's
not
highly
specialized.
i
think
the
government
will
consider
itself
fortunate
anytime
it
gets
seven
qualified
business
and
there's
nothing
here
to
show
that
there
was
anything
more
than
an
economic
burden.
they
said
they
had
seven
licensed.
now,
i
don't
know
what
the
difference
was
in
the
bids.
the
government
hasn't
set
it
out.
it
might
have
been
$5.
i
don't
know.
but
i
still
go
back
to
the
proposition
which
this
court
has
said
over
and
over
that
congress
is
able
to
strike
down
these
state
laws
when
it
feels
as
a
matter
of
congressional
policy,
that
the
state
law
imposes
too
great
a
burden
on
the
federal
government
and
that's
our
case.
if
this
court
determines
that
it
does
that
it
impliedly
conflict
or
specifically
conflicts
then
we
realize
a
state
law
of
united
states.
we
recognize
the
supremacy
of
the
federal
law
in
this
field.
mr.
william
j.
smith
yes,
sir.
and
i
think
that
this
--
this
article
10
that
we
have
quoted
a
part
of
that
goes
right
on
it.
it
has
moved
in
this
field.
that's
one
thing
we
say
that
distinguishes
it.
mr.
william
j.
smith
i
think
that
those
regulations
could
be
reasonably
construed
to
supplement
any
regulations
requiring
permits
and
licenses
on
a
state
or
local
level
or
else
it
would
not
have
in
their
standard
form
adopted
pursuant
to
the
--
to
the
proper
legislation
and
--
and
the
executive
order
authorizing
the
adoption
of
that
form.
they
would
not
here
provided.
now,
if
this
law
falls,
is
there
any
reason
why
a
plumber's
law,
our
electrician's
law,
and
all
the
others
going
down
the
line
if
it
falls.
mr.
william
j.
smith
the
same
regulation
would
apply
to
the
plumber
that
you've
just
referred
to,
mr.
justice
clark.
same
one
i
mean
that
have
to
let
the
same
kind
of
contract
that's
a
construction
contract.
mr.
william
j.
smith
well,
the
general
contractor
--
when
he
contract,
that
government
are
responsible
for
everything
only.
now,
he
may
or
may
not
subpart
of
it
but
if
the
general
contractor
under
the
laws
of
arkansas,
and
i'm
sure
you'll
find
the
same
in
other
states.
a
general
contractor
has
no
right
to
perform
plumbing
unless
he
has
a
license
to
perform
plumbing,
yet
he
contracts
with
the
government
to
install
that
plumber.
the
same
thing
with
the
electricians
and
the
other
licensees
--
licensing
laws
pertaining
to
the
building
industry.
the
building
industry
has
grown
to
be
complex.
we
all
know
that.
it's
probably
the
largest
industry,
income
wise,
and
--
and
employee
payroll
wise,
and
materials
and
everything
in
our
entire
country.
let
us
say
half
of
our
states
have
seen
fit
to
adopt
this
similar
law.
mr.
william
j.
smith
yes.
mr.
william
j.
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
j.
smith
yes,
sir.
generally
speaking,
they
do.
mr.
william
j.
smith
yes,
sir.
we
think
that
they're
required
under
the
law
to
have
a
state
license.
and
if
the
congress
intended
otherwise,
since
they
have
acted
and
that
is
for
you
in
certain
instances
such
as
the
one
i've
mentioned
a
moment
ago
that
was
passed
on
by
this
court
in
carson
v.
roane-anderson.
since
congress
has
acted
to
grant
immunity
or
to
free
its
contractor
from
regulation
under
certain
circumstances.
we
feel
that
if
they
had
intended
--
if
congress
had
intended
they'd
be
free
from
these
regulatory
statutes,
they
would
have
so
fully.
mr.
william
j.
smith
we
think
they
would
be
supplemental.
we
don't
think
that
they
cover
all
appeals.
they're
required
in
the
state
law.
they
cover
some
of
them.
that's
true.
we
don't
think
they
cover
all
of
them.
mr.
william
j.
smith
the
board
has
--
mr.
william
j.
smith
no,
sir.
we
don't
have
the
printed
regulations.
we
have
the
necessary
forms
that
an
--
an
applicant
completes
and
during
the
period
of
inquiry
--
mr.
william
j.
smith
the
board
in
passing
upon
that
treats
every
applicant
within
the
information
furnished
from
that
applicant
and
the
references,
the
information
obtained
by
the
end
of
it
--
end
of
independent
investigation
conducted
by
the
board
as
to
ability,
character,
equipment,
financial,
background,
all
those
things
just
mentioned
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
william
j.
smith
yes.
mr.
william
j.
smith
he
must
be
experienced
in
the
particular
field
that
he
proposed
as
to
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
j.
smith
the
board
has
not
laid
down
specifically
one
or
two
or
three
or
five
or
any
number
of
years.
mr.
william
j.
smith
no,
sir.
he
would
complete
the
application
and
most
contractors
now
of
this
magnitude
on
projects
of
$20,000
or
more
are
companies
or
corporations,
or
organizations,
they're
no
longer
individuals
because
of
the
vast
scope
of
this
industry.
and
therefore
the
--
the
experience
of
the
organization,
his
staff,
and
all
those
things
are
taken
into
consideration
by
the
board
rather
than
the
ability
of
one
particular
man.
mr.
william
j.
smith
no,
sir.
mr.
william
j.
smith
no,
sir.
the
law
says
the
minute
that
--
mr.
william
j.
smith
--
where
general
contractors
appears
in
the
act,
it
means
contractor.
mr.
william
j.
smith
no,
sir.
the
composition
of
the
board
requires
that
one
member
that
they
first
must
have
10
years
experience
in
the
industry.
mr.
william
j.
smith
no,
sir.
in
the
original
act,
i
think
you'll
find
--
mr.
william
j.
smith
yes,
sir.
and
then
goes
over
and
at
least
one
member
said
the
board
shall
have
as
the
larger
part
of
his
business
in
construction
the
highways,
at
least
one
member
set
forth
should've
had
a
larger
part
of
his
business
construction
of
sewers
and
waterways.
this
one
member
of
the
board
shall
have
a
large
part
of
his
business
in
construction
of
buildings.
now,
that
lays
a
specific
requirement
on
only
three
and
lays
a
general
requirement
of
35
years
of
age
and
10
years
on
all
(inaudible).
it's
been
the
government
practice
to
--
for
its
specialty
contractors,
so
they
have
the
two
vacancies.
it's
never
--
i
mean
it
--
it's
been
maintained
throughout
the
years.
let's
say
we'd
have
this
law
18
years
as
a
balanced
board
that
has
been
recognized
by
the
industry
and
the
people
is
being
qualified
to
speak
of
it.
mr.
william
j.
smith
the
last
time
i
check,
mr.
justice
clark,
i
believe
it
was
21
or
22.
i
--
i
remember
--
mr.
william
j.
smith
yes,
they
have
a
board.
and
mr.
chief
justice
i
believe
california
has
the
strongest
one.
out
there,
there's
no
limitation.
if
you
called
yourself
a
contractor
you
have
to
be
licensed,
i
mean
it's
about
that
strong.
but
there's
new
mexico,
the
government
has
referred
in
its
brief
to
some
of
these
but
there's
new
mexico,
louisiana,
tennessee,
alabama,
north
carolina,
south
carolina,
that
i
recall
handled
it.
but
many
of
the
states
have
seen
fit
in
that
because
of
the
--
the
growth
of
the
construction
business.
the
impact
of
the
whole
industry
upon
the
economy
of
the
state
and
they
attempt
to
stabilize,
we
all
know
that
the
totality
--
totality
rate
among
contractors
is
the
highest
of
any
known
industry
now.
i'm
going
outside
the
record,
but
that's
true,
(inaudible)
mr.
william
j.
smith
oh,
i'm
sure
he
does
not.
mr.
william
j.
smith
yes.
mr.
william
j.
smith
well,
of
course
i
must
respectfully
disagree
with
that
fairness
because
i
think
that
when
the
government
comes
into
community
and
--
and
spend
several
million
dollars
or
maybe
80,
90
(inaudible)
different
job
although
--
mr.
william
j.
smith
--
the
building
of
this
airport
i
suspect
cost
$50
million
or
$60
million
dollars.
this
was
one
project
on
there.
below,
we
had
five
cases,
four
at
this
particular
project
and
one
from
fort
smith,
arkansas.
that
was
a
--
a
contract
for
a
national
guard
armory.
those
four
cases
were
not
appealed,
one
of
the
five,
all
five
were
sustained
below.
one
has
been
appealed.
mr.
william
j.
smith
yes,
sir.
we
say
that
if
the
government
takes
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
i
--
i
realize
--
mr.
william
j.
smith
i
--
i
realize
--
i
realize
--
mr.
william
j.
smith
no
--
mr.
william
j.
smith
we
say
he
is
still
an
independent
contractor.
he
is
not
clothed
with
government
immunity
that
he
deals
in
the
community.
he
works
with
employees
of
arkansas.
he
buys
his
supplies
from
the
supplier
of
arkansas.
he
employs
subcontractors
and
overall,
the
object
of
--
of
the
state
law.
mr.
william
j.
smith
no,
sir.
i
distinguish
the
johnson
case
on
the
ground
--
i'm
sorry,
you
misunderstood
me,
that
he
was
an
employee
for
uncle
sam
and
uncle
sam
would
be
responsible
for
his
actions
and
that
he
--
mr.
william
j.
smith
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
mr.
justice
frankfurter
to
what
extent
congress
has
legislated
in
that
field.
i
would
not
pass
an
opinion.
mr.
william
j.
smith
i
quite
agree
with
you.
we
have
a
problem
in
this
case.
i
--
i
do
not
say
if
congress
had
specifically
legislated,
we
would
not
be
here.
mr.
william
j.
smith
yes,
sir,
yes.
and
i
realized
that
this
court
could
determine
there's
a
difference
between
the
point
in
this
case.
mr.
william
j.
smith
i'd
say
they
cannot
be
restricted
if
congress
speaks.
we
don't
think
congress
has
spoken
to
that
extent
in
this
case.
we
say
that
in
line
with
the
penn
dairies
case
and
other
cases
decided
by
this
court
that
congress
always
has
the
ability
to
relieve
the
burden
whereas
if
there
is
any
damage
done
or
any
harm
resulting
from
an
opinion
of
this
court,
the
state
is
parallel
to
remove
that
harm.
mr.
william
j.
smith
i
quite
agree,
yes.
mr.
william
j.
smith
and
congress
could
always
act
to
remove
any
burden
that
maybe
shown
to
exist.
mr.
william
j.
smith
we
feel
that
if
these
regulations
had
been
sound
on
permits
and
licenses
that
could
have
been
implied.
yes,
sir.
but
we
feel
that
in
the
announcement
of
the
formed
contract
that
they
must
get
permits
and
licenses
that
must
have
meant
something
and
we
don't
know
of
any
other
kind
of
permits
and
licenses
that
would
have
to
get
except
licenses.
