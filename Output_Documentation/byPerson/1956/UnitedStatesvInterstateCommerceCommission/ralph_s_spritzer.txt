mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors.
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
government
in
its
capacity
as
a
shipper
of
military
freight
is
claiming
in
substance
that
it
has
been
paying
the
six
appellee
rail
carriers
in
this
case
for
certain
special
or
accessorial
terminal
services
which
it
has
not
in
fact
received
and
which
others
who
have
been
paying
identical
rates
on
identical
shipment
have
been
received.
thus,
the
claim
very
broadly
stated
is
that
the
carriers
have
been
following
an
unreasonable
practice
and
that
there
has
been
unjust
discrimination
as
between
shippers.
a
complaint
making
these
charges
in
detail
was
filed
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
1951.
it
sought
a
holding
that
the
carriers
had
been
and
were
violating
the
act
and
the
entry
of
a
cease
and
desist
order.
the
commission
denied
relief
in
1953.
the
government
then
brought
suit
before
a
three-judge
district
court
challenging
that
order
of
the
commission.
the
majority
sustained
the
commission's
order.
circuit
judge
bazelon
dissented.
the
government
thereupon
appealed
directly
to
this
court
and
probable
jurisdiction
was
noted
early
this
year.
it
will
doubtless
strike
a
familiar
note
to
your
honors
when
i
say
that
the
case
involves
the
matter
of
performance
of
wharfage
and
handling
at
the
port
of
embarkation
located
in
norfolk,
virginia
where
there
was
a
prior
case
which
reached
this
court
in
1949,
which
i've
to
call
norfolk
number
one,
which
arose
from
the
failure
of
the
carriers
serving
norfolk
to
perform
wharfage
and
handling
at
the
very
same
port
of
embarkation
during
world
war
ii.
the
instant
case,
norfolk
number
two,
which
is
in
many
respects
similar
and
involves
at
least
some
issues
which
in
our
view
are
indistinguishable,
involves
a
later
period,
a
period
beginning
in
1951,
when
the
hostilities
in
korea
broke
out
and
when
there
was
a
reactivation
of
the
port
of
embarkation
at
norfolk.
perhaps
i
should
pause
very
briefly
to
summarize
the
history
of
the
earlier
case,
because
i
think
it
is
related
both
procedurally
and
substantively
to
this
case
and
the
court,
doubtless,
will
wish
to
learn
its
present
state.
that
case,
your
honors
may
recall,
also
began
with
a
complaint
by
the
united
states
to
the
interstate
filed
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
there
were
some
difference
in
the
relief
sought
in
as
much
as
in
the
first
case
the
government
was
seeking
reparations
or
damages
for
a
past
period
in
which
it
alleged
it
had
failed
to
receive
these
services,
a
period
running
from
1942
to
1944.
in
the
instant
case,
in
contrast,
the
government
sought
not
reparations
but
a
declaration
that
the
practice
was
illegal
and
a
cease
and
desist
order.
the
government's
purpose
and
intention
being
that
if
it
obtained
a
declaration
that
the
practice
was
unlawful
and
discriminatory
that
it
might
thereupon
set
off
as
against
future
charges
by
these
carriers
the
amounts
of
past
over
charges,
a
procedure
which
is,
of
course,
authorized
in
the
case
of
the
government
as
a
shipper.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
--
that
delay
--
that's
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes
--
well
in
at
least
in
certain
particular.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
really
hadn't
gotten
to
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
yet.
we're
jumping
a
bit
because
the
commission
--
perhaps
i
should
trace
this
so
there
--
there
won't
be
any
confusion
and
say
it's
been
a
long
history.
after
the
government
lost
the
first
case,
its
reparation
case
arising
out
of
world
war
ii,
it
lost
that
before
the
commission
by
a
6-to-5
vote.
and
as
here,
it
went
to
a
three-judge
district
court
to
set
aside
the
order.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
no,
it
went
through
a
three-judge
district
court
and
i
--
i
don't
recall
the
volume
of
the
report.
the
three-judge
court
dismissed
it
out
of
hand
on
the
ground
that
since
the
united
states
must
be
a
statutory
defendant
in
a
suit
to
set
aside
a
commission
order
it
could
not
be
a
plaintiff
in
the
same
proceeding.
the
united
states
it
said
could
not
sue
the
united
states
and
that
there
was
a
direct
appeal
from
that
judgment
of
dismissal
to
this
court.
this
court
distinguished
between
the
capacity
of
the
united
states
suing
as
a
shipper
and
its
position
as
a
statutory
defendant,
and
said
the
united
states
could
bring
a
suit
nominally
against
the
united
states
to
set
aside
an
interstate
commerce
commission
order.
the
court
did
not
reach
the
merits.
it
merely
held
that
there
was
jurisdiction
and
it
remanded.
it
did
one
further
thing.
it
said
that
an
order
denying
reparations
as
distinguished
from
other
orders
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
might
be
reviewed
by
a
single
district
judge.
and
so
it
remanded
the
case
for
consideration
on
the
merits
by
a
single
district
judge.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
it
decided
that
point
in
favor
of
the
government
also.
it
went
back
to
the
single
district
judge
and
he
sustained
the
commission's
orders.
the
government
then
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
since
it
was
an
appeal
now
from
a
decision
of
a
single
district
judge
rather
than
from
a
decision
of
a
three-judge
court.
that's
198
f.2d,
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
first
case.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
district
court
and
set
aside
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
order.
it
did
so
on
a
number
of
grounds
which
i
won't
attempt
to
spell
out
in
detail
now.
it
found
that
the
findings
were
inadequate.
it
found
more
than
that
that
the
commission
had
not
applied
the
principles
of
law
which
it
should
have.
the
court
dealt
at
considerable
length
it's
an
exhaustive
opinion
with
what
it
thought
the
applicable
criteria
were.
it
did
not
take
the
last
step.
it
seems
to
come
very
close
to
it
of
deciding
the
reparation
should
have
been
awarded
but
it
remanded
to
the
commission
so
that
the
commission
would
have
a
chance
to
consider
first
the
many
things
which
the
court
felt
it
had
failed
to
take
into
account.
the
norfolk
number
one
went
back
to
the
commission
and
the
commission
recently
denied
reparations
again.
the
united
states
is
contemplating
taking
that
case
back
to
the
district
court.
i
might
say
that
since
there
are
a
good
many
issues
which
are
uncommon
in
the
two
cases,
it
may
well
be
that
if
--
that
a
resolution
of
this
second
case
will
determine
as
well
the
course
of
the
world
war
ii
case.
turning
now
from
the
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
all
of
the
icc
reports
are
--
are
cited
in
the
briefs,
your
honor.
i
might
say
that
the
icc's
latest
report
in
norfolk
number
one
takes
a
very
similar
view
on
many
issues
to
the
views
taken
in
the
report
which
we
are
now
challenging
by
this
proceeding
to
review
the
decision
in
case
number
two.
turning
from
the
procedural
history
to
the
factual
background
and
i
will
have
to
deal
with
that
also
at
a
little
length
because
i
don't
think
one
can
define
the
precise
issues
of
discrimination
and
unreasonable
practice
until
one
has
stated
the
precise
factors
which
are
part
of
the
picture.
now,
i've
done
indicated,
this
case
involves
military
freight.
it
is
also
export
freight.
that
is
to
say,
freight
which
moves
by
rail
from
various
points
of
origin
to
the
city
of
norfolk
there
to
be
shipped
overseas
to
military
units
or
to
foreign
countries
receiving
military
assistance.
like
any
other
freight,
of
course,
this
freight
has
to
be
unloaded
at
the
terminal.
and
the
job
or
service
of
unloading
is
referred
to
as
"handling".
since
the
freight
is
going
to
be
shipped
overseas
there's
a
further
requirement.
it
has
to
be
placed
down
on
a
pier
so
that
ships
tackle
can
pick
it
up
and
load
it
onto
a
vessel.
the
provision
of
pier
space
is
known
as
wharfage
and
this
case
as
i
earlier
mentioned
involves
the
question
whether
the
railroads
have
been
charging
for
wharfage
and
handling
services
which
they've
not
been
providing
and
which
other
shippers
who
ship
incidentally
over
the
same
pier
have
been
receiving.
now,
i
might
say
a
word
about
the
character
of
unloading
and
wharfage.
i
think
all
of
the
parties
are
agreed
that
the
normal
responsibility
for
the
loading
or
unloading
of
carload
freight,
which
is
what
we
have
here,
is
a
shipper's
responsibility.
similarly,
i
think
the
parties
are
agreed
that
the
railroads
do
not
have
to
go
into
the
business
of
providing
piers.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
of
course,
the
way
in
which
piers
space
and
handling
service
are
provided
very
considerably
from
place
to
place
and
from
time
to
time.
so
far
as
the
matter
of
piers
is
concerned,
some
railroads
own
piers
at
certain
ports.
a
good
many
large
industrial
companies
and
shippers
own
piers.
many
municipal
authorities
are
likewise
pier
owners.
and
then,
of
course,
there
are
a
good
many
companies
which
are
engaged
in
the
business
of
acting
as
commercial
marine
terminal
operators
such
as
bush
terminal
in
new
york,
just
to
cite
a
familiar
example.
now,
the
port
of
embarkation
in
norfolk,
the
united
states
owns
two
very
large
piers
known
as
army
base
piers
1
and
2.
they
were
--
construction
then
of
those
piers
was
begun
back
in
world
war
i
and
they
were
completed
in
the
early
1920s.
they're
capable
of
accommodating
as
many
as
10
ocean-going
vessels
at
a
time.
when
they
were
completed,
of
course,
world
war
i
was
over
and
the
government
decided
not
to
operate
those
piers
itself,
and
it
leased
them
accordingly,
first
to
the
city
of
norfolk
and
later
to
a
succession
of
commercial
terminal
operators.
a
number
of
the
railroads
which
served
norfolk
did
not
and
do
not
own
their
own
piers.
and
from
the
time
that
the
army
piers
were
first
built
some
30
odd
years
ago,
all
of
the
carrier
appellees
have
been
delivering
cars
of
freight
to
those
piers
and
that
practice
has
been
uninterrupted.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
have
been
serving
them
uninterruptedly
for
some
30
odd
years.
that
the
army
had
leased
them
after
they
were
completed
to
a
succession
of
terminal
operators.
there's
no
dispute.
i
might
add
that
these
facilities
are
suitable
terminal
facilities
in
every
sense.
they're
large.
they're
well
equipped.
they
have
mechanical
loading
and
unloading
equipment
and
an
abundance
of
warehouse
space.
now,
while
the
carriers
have
served
these
piers
uninterruptedly,
they
have
had
from
the
first
what
may
strike
the
court
as
a
rather
unusual
arrangement
with
respect
to
providing
these
port
services
to
the
shipper.
the
best
way
to
describe
it,
i
think,
is
to
borrow
from
the
language
of
antitrust
and
to
refer
to
it
as
a
tie-in
arrangement.
and
it
is
this
arrangement
which
is
a
kind
of
but-for
cause
of
the
controversy
which
ultimately
arose
in
world
war
ii
and
then
repeated
itself
in
the
korean
period.
one
would
normally
expect,
i
think,
that
carriers
would
charge
a
line-haul
rate
for
delivering
freight
cars
to
a
terminal.
and
that
thereafter,
the
shipper
would
pay
a
separate
charge
for
the
unloading
and
for
the
use
of
the
pier
to
the
terminal
operator
whoever
he
might
be.
that
is
common
at
most
ports,
but
in
a
number
of
the
north
atlantic
ports
this
tie-in
practice
was
initiated
in
the
1920s.
and
that
practice
is
as
follows.
the
shipper
pays
an
export
rate.
the
carrier
agrees
by
appropriate
tariff
rule
or
provision
that
it
will
provide
the
wharfage
and
handling
services
itself
or
that
it
will
absorb
the
wharfage
and
handling
charges
of
designated
commercial
terminal
operators.
the
wharfage
and
handling
charges
as
the
tariffs
put
it
are
included
in
the
export
rate
to
and
from
norfolk,
virginia.
the
carriers
however
limit
the
places
at
which
this
performance
can
be
obtained.
now,
the
purpose
and
effect
of
this,
we
think,
are
fairly
evident.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
they
will
designate
a
particular
terminal
and
say
at
this
terminal,
wharfage
and
handling
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
charges
of
so
much.
pardon?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
they
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
designate
the
specific
terminals.
for
example,
the
army's
lessee
until
1951
was
a
company
named
stevenson
&
young
and
they
say
in
their
tariffs,
we
included
are
the
charges,
wharfage
and
handling
charges
of
stevenson
&
young
and
then
those
charges
are
specified,
they're
$1
a
ton
as
it
happen.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
the
tariffs
have
restrictions
in
them
as
they
now
appear,
which
exclude
the
army
now
that
it
has
repossessed
the
piers
from
getting
the
advantage
of
this
absorption
and
that
is
what
we
claim
is
discriminatory
in
its
operation.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
is
right.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
there
are
certain
conditions,
which
i'll
come
to
later,
if
i
may
postpone
that
for
the
moment.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
is
correct.
commercial
shippers
getting
their
freight
handled
by
the
commercial
terminal
operator
who
still
operates
on
a
portion
of
the
piers
are
getting
the
benefit
of
the
absorption,
but
if
--
if
i
may
postpone
that
just
a
moment
to
complete
this
background
because
i
think
it
will
help
to
define
the
issues
of
the
case.
the
purpose
and
effect
of
this
tie-in,
as
i
say,
are
--
are
evident,
we
think,
because
if
the
shipper
pays
a
certain
export
rate
and
by
that
act
becomes
entitled
without
paying
anything
further
to
wharfage
and
handling
services
to
particular
piers,
he's
certainly
going
to
be
effectively
deterred
in
ordinary
circumstances
at
least
from
patronizing
somebody
else
because
patronizing
somebody
else
will
mean
that
you'll
have
to
pay
a
second
time.
you'll
have
to
pay
whatever
charges
that
non-designated
operator
might
make
for
performing
the
services.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
it's
an
overall
rate.
it
includes
the
wharfage
and
handling
charges
under
certain
conditions
and
whether
the
conditions,
as
they
operate
here,
make
for
discrimination
is
really
the
issue
that
i'm
going
to
get
to
define
at
the
moment.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
there
are
further
conditions
which
i
have
not
yet
stated
to
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
at
this
port?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i
think
there's
a
tobacco
company
that
owns
a
pier
down
there
and
there
maybe
others.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
carriers
do
not
undertake
to
absorb
the
charges
at
shipper's
piers.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
we
--
we
think
there
are
distinctions
which
between
the
position
of
the
government
operating
a
port
of
embarkation
and
perhaps
the
position
of
a
shipper
who
would
like
for
some
reason
of
commercial
advantage
to
get
delivery
at
one
point
rather
than
another
because
as
the
commission's
findings
in
this
case
show,
it
was
necessary.
the
government
had
no
choice
in
order
to
accomplish
its
mission,
but
to
assume
control
of
this
port
of
embarkation
during
the
war
and
emergency
periods
that
it
did.
so,
i
think
there
are
distinctions
between
the
commercial.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
if
they
insist
on
getting
delivery
at
their
own
piers
rather
than
the
designated
piers.
that
is
correct.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
that
is
right.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
at
norfolk,
is
that
your
question,
your
honor?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
well,
there
are
other
piers
in
operation
at
norfolk.
they're
--
the
army-based
piers
are
not
the
only
piers.
there
are
other
adequate
facilities.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
comes
over
the
government's
piers,
that
is
correct
and
those
commercial
shippers
get
the
absorption.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
arrangement
was
a
flexible
or
a
fluid
one
as
it
worked
out
in
practice.
when
the
government
concluded
in
1951
that
because
of
the
urgencies
and
complexities
of
a
wartime
operation
with
tremendous
volumes
and
specialized
equipment
coming
through
the
port
and
going
to
countless
different
overseas
units,
that
it
would
have
to
take
over
and
that
it
was
necessary
in
the
public
interest
to
resume
control.
it
also
have
decided
that
it
was
going
to
try
to
allow
the
commercial
operator
who
had
been
there
as
lessee
to
continue
in
business
and
to
handle
commercial
freight
to
the
extent
that
that
was
consistent
with
the
military
needs
there.
and
so,
the
government
permitted
to
use
a
--
gave
a
permit
to
this
commercial
operator
to
continue
and
that
permit
covered
a
portion
of
the
piers
and
of
the
warehouse
facilities.
however,
the
record
tells
us
that
in
practice,
it
wasn't
the
same
portion
everyday
so
that
if
there
was
space
available
at
one
end
of
the
pier
for
some
commercial
traffic.
one
day
it
would
be
put
there.
if
there
was
space
at
the
other
end
of
the
pier,
it
might
be
put
there.
and
the
commercial
operator
worked
in
collaboration
with
the
government
supervisors
at
the
piers.
now,
actually
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
that
has
continued
to
be
the
case.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
then
terminated
the
lease
and
resumed
control,
but
having
resumed
control,
it
gave
a
permit
which
permitted
the
former
commercial
operator
to
continue
in
business
there
on
a
limited
portion
of
the
piers.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
and
serve
commercial
shippers
who
shipped
by
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
by
the
railroads,
yes.
the
railroads
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
hired
the
commercial
operator.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
is
right.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
right
and
the
railroads
pay
the
commercial
operator
$1
a
ton
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
out
of
the
tariff.
they
pay
the
commercial
operator
$1
a
ton
as
to
every
ton
of
commercial
freight.
that
is
continued
to
be
the
practice.
i
should
add
in
giving
some
more
of
the
background
that
the
government
resumed
control
of
the
piers
because
it
was
necessary
in
order
to
do
the
planning
of
cargo
and
to
sort
out
the
great
variety
of
freight
and
to
deal
with
the
weight
problem
of
volume.
the
government
assumed
control.
there
are
also
security
considerations
involved
so
far
as
war
material
is
concerned.
the
government
assumed
control
and
proceeded
to
give
detailed
on-the-scene
instructions
as
to
how
the
loading,
the
unloading,
i
should
say,
was
to
be
accomplished.
but
it
made
a
contract
with
stevenson
&
young,
this
commercial
operator,
whereby
stevenson
&
young
continued
to
do
the
physical
work
for
the
government
just
as
it
does
the
physical
work
on
the
commercial
freight.
the
government
took
over
its
entire
supervisory
force,
its
entire
labor
force.
it
hired
it
by
a
contract
and
the
general
manager
of
stevenson
&
young
got
his
instructions
from
the
army
personnel
at
the
piers
and
handled
the
freight
accordingly.
now,
as
i
have
indicated
in
answer
to
questions
earlier,
the
carriers
had
continued
during
this
post
1951
period
to
pay
$1
on
each
ton
of
commercial
freight
which
is
handled
by
the
pier
operator.
the
government
has
hired
stevenson
&
young
to
do
similar
work.
actually,
the
government's
demands
are
far
greater
than
those
with
the
ordinary
shipper.
it
has
asked
a
great
deal,
more
detailed
work
from
the
terminal
operators,
asked
him
to
sort
out
cargo
as
it
comes
in
to
keep
inventory,
detailed
inventory
records
so
that
the
army
can
lay
it's
finger
on
any
piece
of
equipment
at
any
time
to
keep
various
records.
the
consequences
then
that
the
government
has
been
paying
stevenson
&
young
for
its
services,
some
$2.87
a
ton.
we're
not
claiming
that.
what
we
are
claiming
is
simply
that
we
are
entitled
to
the
same
dollar
or
dollar's
worth
of
service
as
the
commercial
shipper
receives
when
he
pays
the
same
overall
rate
that
we
pay.
i
think
i
can
perhaps
sharply
illustrate
what
we
think
is
the
unjustified
discrimination
here
by
an
illustration.
the
commercial
shipper
sends
a
ton
of
lead
pipes
from
columbus,
ohio
to
norfolk.
he
pays,
we'll
say,
a
$10
export
rate.
the
army
does
the
same
thing.
it
pays
the
$10
export
rate.
thereafter,
the
commercial
freight
goes
on,
one
freight
car
with
the
army
pipes
on
another
freight
car
and
back
up
the
same
engine.
the
engine
gets
to
norfolk,
it
switched
to
the
base
piers.
at
that
point,
stevenson
&
young
takes
over
the
commercial
ton
of
pipes
acting
as
agent
for
the
carriers
under
a
contract
which
they
have
with
the
carriers.
they
unload
it
from
the
cars
and
they
put
it
on
the
pier
floor.
they
do
the
same
thing
for
the
army
under
its
instructions.
they
unload
the
army's
ton
of
pipe
and
they
put
it
on
the
pier
floor.
they
probably
or
very
likely
handle
the
two
loads
of
pipe
with
the
same
crew
of
men.
they
put
them
down
on
the
pier
floor
perhaps
alongside
of
one
another.
they're
then
both
picked
up
by
the
same
boat
and
carried
overseas.
now,
on
the
commercial
ton
of
pipes,
the
carrier
pays
stevenson
&
young
a
dollar,
$1
a
ton
for
wharfage
and
handling.
the
military
freight,
the
carriers
had
refused
to
pay
$1
or
any
sum
whatever.
thus
from
the
standpoint
of
the
carriers,
the
carriers
received
$9,
$10
minus
the
one
for
wharfage
and
handling.
they
received
$9
--
they
realized
$9
that
is
for
the
line-haul
carriage
of
a
ton
of
commercial
freight.
now,
the
army's
freight,
they
retained
a
$10
undiminished
by
any
sum,
so
they
retained
$10
for
the
line-haul
carriage
of
a
ton
of
military
freight
identical
in
character
between
identical
points.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
oh,
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
right.
the
commercial
shipper
would
not
get
the
dollar
either
--
even
if
he
insisted
on
a
non-designated
facility.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
now,
i
think
to
begin
with
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
certainly,
and
in
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
right,
and
i'd
like
--
i
would
like
to
refer
at
this
moment
to
a
case
which
tells
that
whole
story.
in
the
1920s,
the
war
department,
port
authorities
from
various
ports,
commercial
shippers
and
terminal
operators
went
to
the
commission
and
they
said,
“why
don't
you
stop
this
practice
in
its
inspection?
it's
bad.”
because
if
the
railroad
had
this
tie-in
arrangement,
it
means
they
can
preempt
the
marine
terminal
business,
which
is
not
the
railroading
business
at
will.
they
can
decide
which
pier
operators
will
be
favored
by
designation
and
which
ones
won't.
they
can
keep
people
out
into
the
marine
terminal
business
very
effectively
by
not
designating
them.
that's
going
to
make
for
discrimination
and
it's
going
to
demoralize
competition.
the
commission
found
that
the
evils
which
the
parties
were
complaining
about
had
not
yet
appeared.
they
appeared
on
the
contrary
that
the
--
that
everybody
was
getting
adequate
service
and
it
refused
the
request
made
to
it
at
that
time
that
the
carriers
be
required
to
state
and
assess
separate
charges
for
wharfage
and
handling.
commissioner
eastman
and
four
other
commissioners
very
vehemently
dissented
at
that
time
and
they
predicted
the
discrimination
a
result
that
there
would
be
no
healthy
competition
in
the
marine
terminal
business
and
that
it
also
would
make
for
much
more
simplified
freight
regulation,
freight
regulation
as
they
were
required
to
state
the
charges
separately.
but
that
view
did
not
prevail
and
so
the
tie-in
arrangement
continued.
now,
the
railroad
interest
in
that
tie-in
arrangement
is
perfectly
clear.
they
can
restrict
the
entry
of
competition
into
the
marine
terminal
business,
a
business
in
which
they
themselves
are
very
frequently
engaged.
also,
they
can
limit
the
number
of
piers
which
they
will
have
to
serve
and
that
is
an
operating
convenience
if
that
was
mixed
for
savings.
they
don't
have
to
send
their
engines
and
their
operating
crews
to
a
larger
number
of
--
of
locations.
so
they
have
a
clear
interest
in
restricting
the
port
practices
as
they
described.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
not
against
other
railroads
but
in
order
to
aid
them
insofar
as
they
are
in
its
terminal
business
and
as
the
standpoint
of
operating
convenience.
now,
the
reason
that
they're
low,
as
i
think,
to
make
allowance
or
adjustment
to
the
army
when
they
found
it
necessary
in
public
interest
to
run
its
port
of
embarkation
and
work
on,
i
think
they're
apprehensive
that
they
might
be
required
to
do
the
same
for
other
private
shippers.
now,
whether
as
an
initial
matter,
restricting
the
port
practices
by
this
tie-in
arrangement
is
a
good
thing,
is
not
a
question
which
the
court
has
to
decide,
i
think.
there
maybe
justifications
for
such
a
restriction
and
the
commissioner
said
that
there
are,
which
don't
apply
here.
now,
the
commission
has
said
in
a
number
of
decisions
that
it's
reasonable
for
the
carriers
to
restrict
the
availability
of
this
absorption
to
designated
public
terminals
if
those
public
terminals
are
adequate.
and
it
is
said
this
serves
a
salutary
purpose
because
it
would
be
wasteful
and
uneconomical
that
the
carriers
were
required
to
disperse
their
traffic
to
any
and
all
piers
at
a
port.
here,
they
can
keep
the
traffic
concentrated.
we
don't
think
that
those
reasons
apply
here.
in
the
first
place,
we
don't
think
that
the
service
can
be
deemed
adequate
because
while
there
are
adequate
facilities
at
the
port
other
than
the
army
base
piers
which
the
army
could
use.
the
exigencies
are
such
that
the
army
must
perform
this
kind
of
operation
at
a
pier
where
its
personnel
are
present
and
in
control.
now,
i'm
not
asking
the
court
to
go
into
an
evidentiary
matter
there
because
i
think
the
commission's
findings
support
fully
what
i've
just
said.
at
record
11,
in
the
paragraph
that
appears
in
the
middle
of
this
page,
your
honors
will
find
a
statement
that
the
army,
from
actual
experience,
has
determined
that
ports
of
embarkation
must
be
operated
by
personnel
of
the
military
service
and
employees
of
the
government.
and
then,
the
commission
goes
on
to
speak
about
the
necessary
training
to
do
the
planning
which
precedes
the
actual
loading
of
the
vessels.
the
commission
tells
us
that
precise
overseas
requirements
demand
absolute
control
over
all
shipments.
security
of
materials
must
be
assured
and
then
it
goes
on
to
describe
how
the
base
has
been
organized.
and
further
on
page
20,
i
will
pause
to
do
more
than
mention
that
in
passing,
the
commission
states
again,
at
the
middle
of
the
page
after
the
citing
areas,
facts
about
the
army
operation.
these
indicate
to
some
extent
the
vast
problem
of
the
army
in
coordinating
the
supplies
received
in
the
various
course
for
shipment
to
its
widespread
forces.
and
so,
i
think
we
have
here
a
case
in
which
on
the
commission's
own
findings,
the
army
have
to
operate
in
a
way
that
it
did
and
hence,
realistically,
there
was
no
adequate
service.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
that
is
correct,
because
i
don't
think
and
in
this,
i'm
paraphrasing
what
judge
washington
said
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
first
case,
and
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
precise
analogy
by
any
means
between
the
situation
of
a
commercial
shipper
who
says,
“i
don't
want
delivery
at
pier
39.
it'd
be
more
convenient
for
me
to
have
it
a
few
blocks
further
south
at
pier
29."
i
say
there's
no
analogy
between
that
and
the
steps
taken
by
the
nation
in
the
public
interest
to
a
--
to
assure
a
smooth
flow
of
war
material
in
time
of
an
emergency.
now,
a
further
prompt
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
we
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
we
find
it
necessary
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
let
me
refer
your
honor
to
the
tariff,
if
i
may.
it's
at
record
458
is
the
provision
that
concerns
us.
and
this
is
a
--
a
provision
out
the
pennsylvania
tariff
which
the
commission
states
to
be
typical.
and
then
it
starts
out
by
stating
certain
exceptions
which
aren't
pertinent
here,
then
it
goes
on
to
say
that,
“wharfage
and
handling
charges,”
i'm
reading
from
that
at
the
third
line,
“wharfage
and
handling
charges
published
in
a
certain
tariff
will
be
included
in
the
freight
rate
to
or
from
norfolk,
subject,”
and
i'm
not
dropping
to
the
end
of
that
paragraph,
“subject
to
the
following
conditions”.
now,
under
(b),
one
of
the
conditions
is
that
the
terminal
operator
is
operating
on
war
properties
which
are
a
public
terminal
facility
of
the
rail
carriers.
and
then,
under
(c),
you
will
note
that
another
condition
is
that
the
shipper
does
not
get
the
benefit
of
the
absorption
unless
the
terminal
operator
is
performing
--
it's
furnishing
the
wharfage
facilities
and
performing
the
handling
services
for
account
of
and
as
agent
for
the
rail
carriers.
then,
the
carriers
say,
“when
stevenson
&
young
is
handling
commercial
freight
under
our
contract
that
was
stevenson
&
young,
he's
acting
for
our
account.
and
therefore,
the
commercial
shipment
meets
the
requirement
of
the
tariff.”
now,
they
say
further,
“on
the
military
traffic,
when
stevenson
&
young
does
the
work
by
arrangement
with
the
army,
it's
acting
for
the
account
of
the
army.
it's
not
our
agent.
and
hence,
the
army
does
not
come
within
these
conditions
and
we
retain
this
dollar.”
now,
we
are
not
quarrelling
with
the
interpretation
of
the
words
that
they
put
into
tariffs.
our
contention
is
that
there
is
discrimination
and
it
is
no
less
discrimination
because
you
close
the
door,
dress
it
up
in
a
provision
of
tariff.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
if
we
will
prepare
at
the
port
of
embarkation
not
to
control
our
own
piers
and
to
make
stevenson
&
young,
the
lessee,
in
full
control,
we
couldn't
--
we
would
get
the
service.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
we
don't
--
we
are
not
given
by
the
railroads
this
absorption
if
we
control
the
pier
at
which
the
freight
was
handled.
they
say
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
they
say
--
the
commission
reasons
that
when
stevenson
&
young
is
acting
in
respect
to
the
commercial
freight
under
its
permit,
that's
a
different
pier
pro
tanto.
they
treat
stevenson
&
young
acting
in
respect
to
the
commercial
freight
as
operating
a
different
pier
from
the
pier
as
a
whole.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
the
commission
found
that
there
are
other
adequate
facilities
for
norfolk,
so
we
could
have
handled
them
somewhere
else.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
if
we
were
prepared
to
give
up
what
the
commission
also
found
to
be
necessary.
that
is
to
say
that
the
government
be
on-the-scene
to
give
detailed
instructions
and
provide
special
safeguards
for
the
handling
of
this
commended
amount
of
military
traffic.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
would
--
the
--
the
facilities
are
adequate
only
in
the
sense
that
they
would
be
physically
adequate.
the
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
and
i'd
like
to
refer
to
the
commission's
brief
in
that
same
connection.
at
page
33
of
its
brief,
the
commission
tells
us
and
i
refer
your
honors
to
the
last
paragraph.
the
commission
says
the
commission
found
that
the
special
requirements
of
the
army's
operation
made
it
necessary
that
the
handling
of
its
freight
be
done
at
its
own
pier
facilities
under
its
control
to
suit
its
own
convenience.
and
that
the
army
did
not
wish
to
use
the
railroad's
pier
facilities
by
which
they
mean
incidentally,
the
army
base
facilities
leased
to
the
commercial
terminal
operator,
thus,
effectively
preventing
the
railroads
from
providing
the
services.
in
other
words,
they
say
the
railroads
don't
undertake
to
provide
service
at
a
shipper's
pier.
they
don't
have
to
work
under
supervision
of
a
shipper
if
they
don't
want.
and
when
the
army,
because
of
necessity
or
otherwise,
chose
to
repossess
its
pier,
it
lost
its
right
to
get
then
to
any
absorption.
now
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
exactly
what
has
been
happening
everyday
with
respect
to
those
who
do
use
the
army's
piers.
commercial
shipments
have
continued
to
come
over
the
army
base
piers
since
1951
and
the
commercial
shippers
had
continued
to
get
the
absorption.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
they
--
the
army
pier
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
insofar
as
commercial
freight
is
handled
at
that
pier
because
the
railroad
say
as
to
that
traffic,
the
terminal
operator
is
acting
as
our
agent
and
therefore
these
conditions
of
the
tariff
are
met.
now,
we
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
their
reasonableness.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
as
applied
to
the
particular
facts
which
are
involved
in
running
a
port
of
embarkation
in
time
of
war
or
emergency.
now,
the
commission
goes
on
at
its
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
the
piers
were
taken
over
in
1951
under
emergency
powers.
as
the
time
of
emergency,
that
was
immediate
left
or
away.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
pardon?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
they
are
still
retained,
it's
my
understanding,
though
the
record
in
this
case
leaves
off
at
1953.
now,
the
carriers
go
on
to
say
after
stating
that
army
operation
was
necessary
and
that
the
railroads
did
not
have
to
perform
at
the
army's
pier,
the
commission
reasons,
and
i
think
this
is
the
core
of
their
case,
and
i'm
still
reading
from
the
bottom
of
33,
“under
such
circumstances,
there
is
no
obligation
upon
the
railroads
to
make
allowance
for
unloading
and
wharfage
for.”
and
they
quote
this
court,
and
they
--
they
quote
from
the
atchison,
topeka,
and
sta.
fe
case,
“for
whatever
transportation
service,
the
law
requires
the
carriers
to
furnish
--
to
supply,”
excuse
me,
“they
have
the
right
to
furnish”.
now,
we
think
their
--
the
whole
fallacy
of
their
case
is
in
that
sentence
because
this
is
not
a
transportation
service
that
the
carriers
are
obliged
to
supply.
they
have
reached
out
and
gone
into
a
business
which
is
not
railroad,
as
the
commission
at
other
points
in
its
brief
states.
they
have
really
preempted
a
related
business,
the
marine
terminal
operation
business,
and
they've
done
it
by
this
device
of
having
an
overall
charge.
now,
they
were
upheld
in
that
in
1929
by
the
commission
which
said,
“we
don't
think
anybody
is
being
hurt
by
having
this
tie-in
arrangement
because
everybody
is
getting
adequate
service."
now,
it's
carried
a
step
further,
as
we
view
it,
because
now
we're
being
told
in
effect,
even
though
you
cannot
use
what
service
would
be
made
available
to
you
by
the
carrier,
even
though
the
railroads
are
unwilling
and
unprepared
to
give
the
particular
kind
of
need
which
you
have,
you
still
must
pay
the
overall
charge
and
get
benefit
of
no
adjustment.
now,
as
we
view
the
atchison,
topeka
and
sta.
fe
case,
it
holds
precisely
the
opposite.
the
first
issue
in
that
case,
which
this
court
unanimously
decided,
involved
the
matter
of
providing
refrigerated
cars
for
shipper's
use.
this
court
held
that
the
hepburn
act
imposed
a
specific
duty
on
carriers
to
provide
refrigerated
cars
for
shippers.
and
it
said
that
that
being
so,
the
carriers
having
made
immense
investments
in
order
to
be
in
a
position
to
provide
these
refrigerated
cars
must
have
an
exclusive
right
to
furnish
them.
the
carriers
can't
be
told
by
particular
shippers
that
we
won't
use
your
refrigerated
cars.
we'll
supply
our
own
refrigeration.
the
court
said
that
that
would
be
obviously
unfair
and
as
much
as
the
carrier
has
to
be
standing
by
or
ready
to
provide
the
services,
it
should
not
be
made
to
depend
upon
haphazard
calls
for
it.
then,
this
court
went
on,
however,
and
it
considered
the
matter
providing
the
so-called
accessorial
services
which
aren't
within
the
transportation
obligation,
services
which
are
sometimes
performed
by
shippers,
which
are
sometimes
performed
by
carriers,
which
are
sometimes
performed
by
third
parties.
and
the
court
said,
“now,
in
that
situation,
it
must
be
determined
on
the
fact
of
each
particular
case
who
may
better
perform
the
job
and
the
public
interest
should
be
considered.”
and
then,
the
court
went
on
to
state
what
the
consequence
of
that
determination
would
be,
and
we've
quoted
a
paragraph
which
has
crucial
bearing,
i
think,
on
this
case,
the
paragraph
from
the
atchison
opinion
at
page
14
of
our
reply
brief.
i'll
read
those
two
sentences,
if
i
may.
“neither
party
has
a
right
to
insist
upon
a
wasteful
or
expensive
service
for
which
the
consumer
must
ultimately
pay.
the
interest
of
the
public
is
to
be
considered
as
well
as
that
of
shippers
and
carriers.”
then,
i
would
ask
your
honors
to
mark
these
words
particularly.
“their
rights,"
that
is
the
right
to
shippers
and
carriers,
"in
turn
having
been
adjusted
by
a
reduction
in
the
rate,
if
the
loading
is
done
in
whole
or
in
part
by
the
shipper
and
by
an
increase
in
the
rate
where
the
loading
is
done
in
whole
or
in
part
by
the
carrier,
but
--
by
whom
so
ever
done,
the
loading
must
be
such
as
to
fit
the
freight
for
shipment.”
now,
the
only
way
we
can
fit
this
freight
for
shipment
at
the
army
base
piers
is
to
have
the
personnel
on
the
piers
to
give
the
on-the-scene
directions.
the
only
way
we
can
fit
the
freight
for
shipment
is
by
being
in
control
of
those
piers.
the
carriers
say
they
are
unwilling
to
work
for
the
army
when
it
is
in
control
of
the
pier.
when
these
piers
were
repossessed,
they
were
asked
if
they
would
undertake
not
to
provide
handling
under
our
direction
with
--
with
the
government
giving
detailed
specifications
as
to
what
it
wanted
done
and
they
refused.
they
said,
“no,
we
don't
work
at
shippers'
piers.”
so,
the
army
then
went
ahead
and
actually
proceeded
to
use
for
its
labor
the
very
same
people
whom
the
carriers
used.
and
we've
been
told
contrary,
we
think,
to
the
teaching
in
the
atchison
case
that
there
is
to
be
no
adjustment.
we
are
of
the
view
that
since
it
was
necessary
for
the
government
to
operate
the
piers
under
the
commission's
own
findings
that
the
carriers
in
that
circumstance
at
least
are
obliged
to
untie
the
package
which
they've
tied
together,
that
they're
obliged
to
make
the
same
$1
adjustment
in
the
case
of
the
military
freight
as
they
do
in
the
case
of
the
commercial
freight.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
well,
there
--
there
are
a
good
many
things.
let
me
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
perhaps
give
one
or
two
illustrations,
if
--
if
i
may
and
perhaps
the
--
a
bit
of
the
testimony
would
be
best
for
that
purpose.
at
177,
we
have
the
testimony
of
the
general
manager
of
the
stevenson
&
young
company
in
177
and
178.
and
he
points
out
there's
a
vast
--
on
177,
that
there's
a
vast
amount
of
clerical
works
superintendent's
administration
to
keep
his
--
this
complexity
of
savings
into
some
reasonable
form.
the
army
indicates
that
1200
to
1500
cars
of
freight
coming
here
a
month
maybe
more
going
to
a
lot
of
different
destinations
all
over
the
world
under
various
force
marks.
it's
complicated.
we
have
to
handle
it
in
a
complicated
manner.
we
have
to
keep
it
straight.
we
have
to
keep
an
inventory
for
the
army
so
they
will
know
just
what
they
have.
and
then
over
on
178,
he
says,
“having
been
in
the
army
myself,
i
have
some
idea
of
their
problem.
it
is
a
vast
problem
of
coordination
of
supplies
to
forces
all
over
the
world.”
a
little
later
on
78,
he
asked
--
he's
asked
why
it
can't
move
to
a
port
terminal
just
like
any
commercial
freight
and
he
answers,
“theoretically,
it
can,
but
i
think
it
is
too
complicated
a
job
to
funnel
that
freight
through
one
spot
without
the
army
being
there
with
their
hands
on
the
funnel."
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
basically
that,
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
and
where
the
service
is
not
adequate
to
the
shipper's
needs,
we
certainly
think
then
that
there
can
be
no
continued
justification
for
this
tie-in
arrangement.
now,
i
should
emphasize
that
it's
no
greater
burden
to
the
railroads
since
it
doesn't
physically
perform
the
work
itself.
in
respect
to
the
commercial
freight,
any
more
than
it
does
on
the
military
freight,
it's
no
burden
to
pay
this
$1
to
the
army
or
the
military
freight
if
they
don't
have
in
respect
to
the
commercial
freight.
it's
no
greater
burden
to
pay
a
dollar
to
x
than
pay
a
dollar
to
y.
now,
that's
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i
--
i
was
going
off
on
a
different
point,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
we
don't.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
think
the
--
i
think
this
is
our
answer
to
that.
we
think
if
the
carriers
are
going
to
preempt
this
terminal
business,
which
is
a
dubious
practice
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
at
best.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
on
the
sense
that
they
have
a
tie-in.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
now,
our
--
our
answer
to
the
situation
of
the
private
shipper
is
this.
we
think
it
may
be
reasonable
for
the
condition
to
permit
the
port
practices
to
be
restricted,
maybe
reasonable
to
permit
this
kind
of
arrangement
where
the
service
which
the
railroad
is
offering
at
its
designated
piers
is
fully
added
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
maybe
then
it's
reasonable
to
say,
“well,
we'll
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
if
the
carrier
--
if
the
shipper
absolutely
needs
to
process
this
freight
up
to
the
port.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
he
could
pick
a
pay
for
a
special
service.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
we
are.
we're
paying
$2.87
a
ton
for
the
handling
of
our
freight.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
we're
not
claiming
that.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
we
say
we
just
want
a
dollar.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it's
not
available
under
the
terms
of
the
tariff,
but
similar
service
is
being
provided
to
all
commercial
shipments
at
the
army
based
piers.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
if
--
if
it
were
satisfactory
to
our
needs,
we
could
get
service
by
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
by
getting
off
to
the
piers
and
turning
them
over
to
the
lessees.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
we're
trying
to
and
we
haven't
succeeded
since
world
war
ii
to
get
what
the
private
shipper
gets.
we've
stayed
there
and
we
were
told
as
soon
as
we
resumed
control
of
the
piers
on
which
the
traffic
moved,
we
lost
our
right
to
this
$1
a
ton
absorption.
now,
let's
say,
your
honors,
that
it
appears
from
the
record
that
if
a
commercial
shipper
wants
to
get
extra
special
--
extra
or
additional
service
from
stevenson
&
young,
he
can
get
it
and
pay
for
it
separately
without
losing
the
benefit
of
this
$1
a
ton.
but
because
we
do
not
meet
the
tariff's
condition
that
stevenson
&
young
must
be
acting
as
agent
in
--
on
account
of
the
railroad,
we
are
told
we
can
get
no
absorption.
now,
our
position
basically
is
this.
we've
been
paying
a
rate
which
is
concededly
compensatory.
the
tariffs
of
the
carriers
say
that
wharfage
charge
and
handling
charges
are
included.
we've
not
been
getting
that
service
as
a
result
of
a
condition
which
operates
here
unreasonably
and
discriminatorily.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
--
yes,
i
certainly
think
so.
i
think
the
commission's
decisions
saying
you
have
to
take
the
service
as
specified
in
the
tariff
at
particular
localities,
at
particular
places
can
be
justified
on
the
commission's
own
reasoning
in
the
past
only
on
the
assumption
that
that
service
is
fully
adequate
to
the
needs
of
the
shipper.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
think
in
each
case
where
you
get
into
this
shadow
area
whether
the
shipper
should
perform
or
whether
the
carrier
should
perform,
as
the
atchison
case
teaches,
it
must
be
decided
who
can
better
perform
in
the
public
interest.
now,
if
the
carriers
cannot,
at
a
designated
facility,
serve
the
legitimate
needs
of
the
shipper,
then
i
can
see
no
basis
whatever
for
the
carriers
to
continue
charging
an
overall
rate.
we
think
they're
required
under
the
reasoning
of
the
atchison
case
to
make
the
adjustment
to
the
shipper.
what
comes
down
to
in
this
case
is
that
since
the
army
had
to
run
its
own
port
of
embarkation,
the
carrier
realized
that
the
$1
a
ton
more
per
line
for
carriage
of
the
same
freight.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
there
are
only
two
types
of
shipments
that
come
over
at
the
army
base
piers,
one
is
the
military
and
the
other,
the
shippers
of
commercial
freight.
now,
the
shippers
of
commercial
freight
whose
traffic
is
handled
side-by-side,
they're
not
paying
anything
additional
to
stevenson
&
young.
the
carriers
are
paying
$1
to
stevenson
&
young
and
they're
getting
their
service,
we're
not.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
correct.
