justice

what
--
what
did
you
say
was
the
result
of
the
(inaudible)
of
the
two
cases?
justice
harold
burton
you
--
you
cite
that
the
decision
of
the
--
of
the
icc
in
this
first
case,
the
one
that
decided
that
there
was
no
reparation.
justice
harold
burton
i
don't
understand
what
you
mean
by
saying
limited
places.
justice
harold
burton
they
don't
--
they
don't
say
at
norfolk.
justice
harold
burton
they
don't
say
at
norfolk.
justice
harold
burton
what
--
justice
harold
burton
does
those
tariffs
include
these
army
ports,
these
army
--
justice
harold
burton
the
tariff
--
the
railroads
published
the
tariff.
justice
harold
burton
and
the
tariff
says
it
includes
as
a
pier
of
embarkation,
the
army
piers,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
harold
burton
physically.
justice
harold
burton
there
is
no
--
no
separation
of
it.
justice
harold
burton
but
what
--
what
bothered
me
--
but
i
understand
the
only
condition
is
that
it
moves
over
pier
x.
justice
harold
burton
is
that
the
situation
now?
justice
harold
burton
so,
what
--
what
happened
if
the
government
leased
its
pier
to
commercial
operator?
justice
harold
burton
and
serve
the
railroads.
justice
harold
burton
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
harold
burton
the
railroad
--
justice
harold
burton
the
railroads
made
an
arrangement
to
the
commercial
operator
--
justice
harold
burton
--
to
deliver
their
freight
unto
the
pier
and
the
commercial
operator
then
loads
it
on
shipside.
justice
harold
burton
out
of
the
tariff.
justice
harold
burton
is
the
bill
of
--
justice
harold
burton
--
ladings
the
same?
justice
harold
burton
mr.
spritzer.
justice
harold
burton
there's
one
thing
i
don't
understand.
is
there
any
reason
why
the
government
couldn't
ship
its
goods
exactly
by
the
shipper
to
this
under
the
same
bill
of
lading
to
the
same
pier,
to
the
base
pier,
to
be
handled
exactly
like
the
private
shipowner,
is
that
it?
justice
harold
burton
i
understand
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
harold
burton
--
they
weren't
for
service
and
they
--
they
want
in
a
different
time
and
they
want
people
to
look
at
it
in
a
different
way,
i
understand
that.
justice
harold
burton
but
so
far
as
the
tariff
itself
is
concerned
--
justice
harold
burton
but
is
--
is
there
any
reason
why
the
government
can't
use
this
tariff
exactly
as
it's
written
if
they
felt
that
you
gave
them
the
things
that
they
wanted?
justice
harold
burton
that
will
--
that'd
be
--
be
no
of
difficulty
in
controlling
any
part
of
your
piers
if
you
wanted
to.
justice
harold
burton
well,
then
--
then
the
--
the
shipper
could
not
get
advance
to
this,
a
commercial
shipper
if
you're
in
control
of
that
pier.
justice
harold
burton
is
this
the
time
for
emergency?
justice
harold
burton
(inaudible)
justice
harold
burton
still
at
the
time
or
that
time
of
emergency.
justice
harold
burton
does
the
government
--
does
the
government
--
excuse
me,
are
you
going
to
say
something?
justice
harold
burton
does
the
government
take
the
position
that
the
army
is
entitled
to
something
that
a
private
shipper
couldn't
get?
suppose
--
justice
harold
burton
let's
assume
this
is
a
manufacturer
of
some
electrical
appliances
and
had
some
--
particularly
to
handle
very
carefully
(inaudible)
would
they
have
an
opportunity
to
get
this
reduction?
justice
harold
burton
well,
i'm
assuming
(voice

--
justice
harold
burton
--
in
this
situation.
justice
harold
burton
you
have
preempted
it
in
a
sense
that
they
were
furnished
(inaudible)
justice
harold
burton
and
then
the
only
way
you
can
get
it
delivered
of
at
this
terminal
is
to
pay
this
charge
for
the
commercial
shipment.
justice
harold
burton
well,
i
--
justice
harold
burton
(voice

illustration
where
it
wouldn't
be
bad?
justice
harold
burton
to
--
to
have
a
lift
as
the
ordinary
pier
operator
handles
it
will
damage
the
delicate
machinery
with
the
private
commercial
manufacturer
shipment.
justice
harold
burton
can
the
--
can
the
government
do
the
same
thing?
justice
harold
burton
but
you're
not
--
justice
harold
burton
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
harold
burton
you're
not
saying
that
or
anything
that's
available
unto
the
others.
justice
harold
burton
and
this
goes
back
to
what
i
asked
you
at
the
first
time
(inaudible)
justice
harold
burton
(inaudible)
the
government
could
get
exactly
the
service
that
a
private
shipper
could
get
if
they
want.
justice
harold
burton
(voice
overlap)
shippers
--
justice
harold
burton
or
--
or
they're
staying
right
there
that
they
could
get
exactly
the
same
service
that
the
private
shipper
(inaudible)
justice
harold
burton
but
if
he
did
that
at
his
pier
at
norfolk
under
the
present
tariff,
he
--
he
would
still
have
to
pay
the
same
amount
of
tariff
that
he
does
now,
is
it
not?
justice
harold
burton
the
same
rate.
in
other
words
--
justice
harold
burton
--
he
--
he
would
not
get
the
dollar.
justice
harold
burton
and
the
device
in
that,
device
is,
is
in
allowing
the
railroads
to
strict
the
service
to
their
own
--
to
these
particular
piers.
justice
harold
burton
that
question
is
not
here.
justice
harold
burton
but
--
but
that,
in
essence,
that
question
is
here,
is
it,
when
the
government
asked
to
have
the
money
returned
to
them,
the
dollar?
justice
harold
burton
now,
what
--
what
is
the
reason
that
all
these
excess
story
of
services
like
wharfage
in
this
case
or
stories
that
seems
to
be
an
old
case
and
so
forth
are
not
added
on
to
the
line-haul,
that
is
separate
in
the
part
from
it?
that's
all
that
they're
asking
for
here.
is
that
all
that
the
government
is
asking
for?
justice
harold
burton
well,
but
it
--
it
affects
--
justice
harold
burton
it
--
it
affects
just
to
get
to
that?
justice
harold
burton
what
if
it
is
given
to
the
government,
does
it
have
to
be
given
to
private
shippers?
justice
harold
burton
(voice

--
justice
harold
burton
the
determination
which
you're
objecting
to
(voice

--
justice
harold
burton
does
the
--
does
the
army
pay
the
export
rate?
