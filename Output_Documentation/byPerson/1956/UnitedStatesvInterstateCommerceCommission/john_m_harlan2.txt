in
other
words,
if
i
understand
you,
under
the
tariffs
as
written,
assuming
that
they
are
valid
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
the
army
would
not
be
entitled
to
this
--
justice
john

but
--
justice
john
m.

but
assuming
--
assuming
in
your
illustration
that
the
commercial
shipment
went
not
to
a
public
pier
but
that
stevenson
&
young
was
operating
as
the
agent
for
the
shipper
who
owned
that
pier
and
that
commercial
shipment
would
receive
exactly
the
same
treatment
that
the
army
received,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
real
discrimination
here
is
whether
or
not
there's
a
justification
for
treating
commercial
piers,
different
--
different
private
piers,
isn't
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
what
you're
really
saying,
i
take
it
is,
that
the
discrimination
between
private
and
public
piers
in
these
tariffs
is
just
only
when
the
shipper
has
a
reasonable
choice
of
using
the
public
pier
as
distinguished
from
these
private
piers.
justice
john
m.

how
many
years
did
you
say
this
type
of
differentiation
between
private
and
public
piers
is

justice

what
page
is
that
finding
of
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understood
mr.
spritzer
to
expressly
agree
with
you
on
that
point,
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
there
any
other
situations,
any
other
ports
or
--
or
are
there
any
ports
where
there
is
no
public
pier,
where
there's
only
a
private
pier,
sort
of
this,
and
where
private
piers
are
leased
out
for
public
purpose?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice

--
justice
john
m.

no
public
piers.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
assume
not.
