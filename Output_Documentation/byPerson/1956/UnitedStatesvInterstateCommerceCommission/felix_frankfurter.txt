justice
felix
frankfurter
it
first
had
to
decide
it
might
be
reviewed
sooner.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
government
the
only
shipper
that
has
a
private
pier?
or
they
own
or
pier-owned
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
this
port,
yes.
i'm
talking
about
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
tariff?
what
is
the
absorption
or
the
situation
as
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
and
--
and
doesn't
discriminate
against
the
government
as
shipper
and
in
fact,
there
are
other
shippers
in
the
situation
(inaudible)
the
government,
is
that
correct?
i'm
asking
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
similar
--
in
addition
to
that
or
in
parts
of
that
for
similar
services
on
a
private
pier
owning
shippers,
i
figured
that
the
government
is
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
on
the
government
piers,
there
are
other
--
there
are
shippers
other
than
the
government.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
--
does
most
of
the
export
stuff,
export
stuff,
is
that
unloaded
on
the
government
pier?if
you
tell
me
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
--
one
(inaudible)
to
talk
to
only
because
it's
about
norfolk.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
a
good
--
a
good
deal
of
non-government
stuff.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
(inaudible)
would
you
be
good
enough
to
explain
the
--
enlighten
us
to
--
us
to
(inaudible)
on
why
the
railroad
has
absorbed
the
commercial
shippers.
isn't
that
if
they
didn't,
then
the
ship
--
they
will
move
(inaudible)
to
some
other
road
or
some
other
port?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
in
other
words,
they
complete
this
problem
by
abolishing,
by
not
giving
anyone,
by
not
absorbing
anything.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
please
tell
me
just
(inaudible)
why
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
against
other
railroads.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
--
am
i
right
in
inferring
from
what
you've
said
and
what
you
are
talking
right
now
that
the
decision
in
this
case
could
not
determine
the
duty
to
absorb
or
not
other
privately
owned
ships?
justice
felix
frankfurter
after
enough
pier
facility,
with
reference
to
which
there
is
absorption
to
be
(inaudible)
to
enable
the
government
to
ship,
to
dispose
of
its
business
and
(inaudible)
on
owned
piers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
have
it
absorbed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
cannot
--
does
not
--
exactly
cannot
be
done
on
the
piers,
which
typically
speaks
of
--
or
available
for
government
export
material,
then
--
then
(inaudible)
might
use
the
word
available,
but
it
isn't
available.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
you
--
and
you
say
further
that
this
--
this
(inaudible)
choice
situation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it
seems
there
is
(inaudible)
choice,
you
say
the
findings
of
the
commission,
you
think,
is
out
of
controversy
in
--
in
the
record
(inaudible)
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
finding
--
the
finding
really
gets
down
to
the
question
whether
--
assuming
that
there
were
no
--
that
there
were
no
(inaudible)
had
to
use
the
army
piers,
there
were
no
commercial
shippers,
everybody
had
to
use
the
army
piers
than
the
commercial
shippers,
what
would
be
the
situation?
would
it
be
absorption
for
the
commercial
shipper
and
not
for
the
government?
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
they
control
--
in
case
(inaudible)
control
on
another
commercial
pier.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
they
get
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
not
challenge
whether
the
conditions
of
the
tariff
are
met.
you're
challenging
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
(inaudible)
of
the
tariff.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
it
take
much
time
as
--
to
indicate
what
it
is
with
something
(inaudible)
or
figure
in
mind
what
it
is
that
makes
the
handling,
etcetera,
necessary
or
unavailable
at
the
--
at
the
(inaudible)
piers?
what
kind
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
no
to
that.
you
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
accept
that
(inaudible)
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
--
i
must
ask
you
one
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
before
you
sit
down.
assume
that
the
american
oil
company
exports
business
is
as
--
is
conceivable,
enormously
expanded,
enormously
expanded
so
that
they're
new
to
the
expanded
export
of
oil
in
all
the
same
time,
exactly
the
same
time
in
consideration,
coordination
and
funneling
and
all
the
other
words
that
you
use
and
therefore
that
--
and
they
can't
--
and
they
can't
carry
that
out
on
one
of
the
available
public
piers
and
wants
to
do
it,
do
do
it
on
the
government's
piers,
would
they
or
would
they
not
be
entitled
to
the
claim
you
made
for
the
(inaudible)
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
in
my
hypothetical
case,
all
these
oil
companies
or
the
consortium
of
the
american
oil
company
may
have
appealed
owned
by
them
adequate
to
the
--
to
a
much
small
outpoured
oil
than
to
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
happens
in
this
case
and
(inaudible)
because
i
don't
know
nothing
about
it
yet.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
happens
that
in
this
case,
the
army
is
the
only
shipper
(inaudible)
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
ginnane,
if
stevenson
&
young
didn't
have
this
portion
with
piers
1
and
2,
would
they
have
handled
the
freight
on
some
other
private
piers,
from
other
piers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
point
of
your
physical
facilities.
suppose
the
government
said,
â€œwe
need
all
of
this.
(inaudible)
any
private
shipments
on
piers
1
and
2.
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
all
private
shipments.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
don't
ask
you
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
they
would
(inaudible)
by
the
pier
or
not
under
their
control
or
that's
(inaudible)
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
far
as
the
railroads
were
concerned,
that
--
that's
the
question
that
i
(inaudible)
so
far
as
the
railroads
are
concerned,
so
far
as
the
railroads
are
concerned,
is
there
any
burden
to
cast
upon
them,
does
it
make
any
difference
to
the
railroad
that
the
army
exercises
its
unique
control
over
its
freight
(inaudible)
private
ship?
how
does
it
affect
the
railway,
physically
or
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
about
dollar's
worth?
is
there
any
equation
there
between
a
dollar's
worth
for
the
army
and
a
dollar's
worth
for
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
that
there's
--
a
private
shipper
who
had
a
pier
(inaudible)
conveniently
could
take
care
of
the
exportable
freight
and
where
it
couldn't
(inaudible)
where
it
couldn't
be
conveniently
handled
at
a
--
at
a
competent
market
here
wouldn't
get
--
wouldn't
have
his
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
opinion
as
to
this,
mr.
ginnane,
just
give
me
the
name
of
one
big
shipper
who
owns
a
pier
(inaudible)
any
one.
i
suppose
(inaudible)
what's
the
name?
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
when
an
oil
for
export
(inaudible)
delivering
at
its
pier?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
is
there
some
--
is
there
some
way
there
is
a
tariff?
what
i
want
to
know
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
tell
me
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
imperial
tobacco
company.
if
a
shipment
of
tobacco
for
the
imperial
tobacco
(inaudible)
somewhere
in
europe,
would
assume
that
maybe
(inaudible)
of
the
car
of
tobacco
can't
appear
in
(inaudible)
is
that
supported
as
a
matter
of
custom
for
its
(inaudible)
for
imperial
tobacco,
is
that
stuff
delivered
at
the
pier
of
the
imperial
tobacco?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
they
do
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
they
do
specify,
i
was
assuming
that
they
so
specify,
and
if
they
so
specify
(inaudible)
is
delivered
to
their
pier,
is
the
dollar
absorbed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
matter
what
the
reason
is
why
they
want
it
delivered
in
that
same
pier,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
that's
why
he
(inaudible)
first,
can
we
know
from
this
record
whether
the
shipments
for
the
imperial
tobacco
are
or
are
not
absorbed
by
the
railroads
i
think
in
this
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
not
absorbed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
(inaudible)
that
because
that
--
that's
their
choice.
it
would
just
as
--
if
you
want
to
(inaudible)
that's
their
choice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
--
and
then
the
difference
to
the
narrow
ones,
that
imperial
is
free
to
have
(inaudible)
but
it
could
be
delivered
to
some
other
pier
without
the
necessity
(inaudible)
without
the
necessity
that
it
must
be
delivered
to
the
army.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
a
narrow
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
they
can.
that's
supposed
to
be
(inaudible)
it
might
(inaudible)
so
far
as
--
so
far
as
the
(inaudible)
in
your
control,
it
could
be
taken
care
of
as
in
other
and
its
own
(inaudible)
but
in
the
case
of
the
army,
it
could
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
think
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
spritzer
makes
--
mr.
spritzer
relies
on
the
finding
of
the
commission
that
it's
necessary
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
according
to
--
what
i
understood
mr.
spritzer's
argument,
that's
the
conclusion
to
the
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
is
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
so
the
army,
that
it
--
and
--
and
therefore,
it
must
be
absorbed.
it
must
be
just
as
valid
in
the
case
of
a
private
shipper.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
ginnane,
is
--
is
such
subtle
as
(inaudible)
that
the
legal
question
is
so
subtle
in
what
(inaudible)
but
i
just
like
to
ask
you
a
question
before
i
proceed
what
i
fully
understand
that
the
commission's
position
(inaudible)
the
interstate
commerce
act
allows
you
to
make
charges
for
--
for
services
rendered
in
the
transportation
(inaudible)
the
railroad
can
only
be
in
transportation
business,
that
is
the
(inaudible)
but
transportation
isn't
a
technical
and
exclusive
form,
there's
an
area
of
(inaudible)
and
not
be
deemed
transportation
and
certainly,
one
must
started
the
proposition
that
the
railroads
have
been
allowed
as
part
of
the
transportation
services
to
indulge
in
the
wharfage
business
in
their
hand
after
the
(inaudible)
now,
then,
is
your
position
is
that
the
railroads
tomorrow,
if
they
want
to,
could
say,
â€œwe
just
come
up
to
our
terminal
in
the
norfolk
as
everybody
--
we
are
not
going
to
do
a
thing.
we're
not
going
to
unload.
we
make
no
positions
for
unloading
every
shipper,
we
must
do
the
best
that
we
can."
it
could,
couldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
it's
not
arguable.
i
don't
think
it's
arguable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
don't
think
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
don't
suppose
that
was
arguable.
i'm
assuming
that
the
(inaudible)
having
the
--
the
railroads
may
--
are
allowed
without
indulging
in
services
that
are
not
--
that
are
nontransferable
services,
the
concept
of
transportation
(inaudible)
the
number
as
it
is.
they
may
give
this
wharfage
and
just
wharfage
services
and
that
your
position
or
the
commission's
position
is
that
the
government
decrees
that
the
railroads
will
give
wharfage
service
on
condition,
on
their
condition
that
they
will
undertake
the
wharfage
even
themselves
or
for
appropriate
agents
but
if
any
shipper
for
any
reason,
convenience
and
necessity
or
what
it
wants
to
do
in
all
(inaudible)
then
we
will
give
you
that
service
or
include
it,
absorb
it
in
the
line-haul.
isn't
that
the
position
of
the
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
of
the
reasons
behind
that
line
of
decision,
mr.
ginnane,
is
that
a
contrary
decision
would
open
the
door
to
cover
rebates
(inaudible)
that
is
you
take
to
break
the
company
like
the
(inaudible)
process
if
it
once
require
to
deliver
the
interchange
traffic,
they
could
have
the
benefit
of
their
(inaudible)
15-20
miles,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
such
consideration
here
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
only
point
about
accessorial
as
against
physical
transportation
services
is
that
you
don't
have
to
deal
accessorial
services,
but
you
do
have
to
haul
a
train.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
freight
--
the
freight,
the
destination
of
which
is
--
is
norfolk
itself,
the
distribution
from
norfolk.
that
freight
doesn't
get
the
benefit
of
this
doubt.
it
doesn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
is
that
indicated
in
the
bills
of
lading
at
the
point
of
origin?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
the
government.
i'm
talking
the
imperial
tobacco.
you
say,
if
--
if
a
stock
goes
straight
from
--
from
here
--
from
the
pier
to
the
haul
of
the
ship,
that's
an
export
shipment
and
tied
in
to
an
export
rate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
car.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
that
is
indicated
in
the
bill
of
lading
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
at
the
point
of
origin.
