mr.
windsor
f.
cousins
if
it
please
the
court.
this
case,
including
the
other
norfolk
case,
had
been
decided
four
times
by
the
full
commission.
its
decisions
were
in
line
with
12
or
15
other
opinions
of
the
commission
over
the
past
four
years.
the
principles
that
the
commission
has
established
are
strictly
in
accord
with
the
rules
laid
down
by
this
court
in
the
famous
allowance
cases
such
as
the
old
arbuckle
case,
u.s.
versus
b.
&
o.,
231
u.s.
274.
now,
not
only
has
the
commission
held
that
it
is
not
discriminatory
to
do
what
we
do,
but
the
commission
has
held
again
and
again
that
if
we
did
for
any
private
shipper
such
as
standard
oil,
who
has
a
pier
at
norfolk,
swift,
army,
only
the
biggest
industries
who
can
afford
to
track
--
track
vessel,
if
we
did
for
anyone
of
them
what
the
government
asks
us
to
do
here,
we'd
be
guilty
of
a
rebate.
so
the
justice
department,
instead
of
standing
up
for
principles
of
regulation
that
have
been
established
by
the
courts
and
by
the
commission
is
attempting
here
for
the
sake
of
winning
a
money
judgment
to
throw
out
of
the
window
every
rule
that
we
know
about
and
have
kept
strictly
in
action
during
the
past
four
years
to
avoid
rebates.
now,
let
me
simplify
this.
to
answer
justice
black,
although,
i
don't
want
to
begin
at
this
point,
no
shipper
pays
more
than
any
other
shipper.
no
shipper
pays
for
service
he
doesn't
get,
including
the
military.
we
don't
--
we
don't
charge
anybody
for
providing
piers
and
unloading
their
freight
if
we
don't
render
the
service.
now,
there
is
a
great
excess
of
pier
facilities
in
norfolk,
probably
10
times
more
than
can
be
used.
four
railroads
own
their
own
pier
facilities,
an
operator.
those
piers
are
adequate
to
handle
all
the
traffic
that
goes
through
norfolk
including
the
military.
one
of
those
railroads,
the
chesapeake
and
ohio
also
serves
this
so-called
army
base,
publishes
the
same
export
rates
that
the
other
railroads
published
but
does
not
undertake
to
absorb
any
wharfage
or
handling
charges.
it
never
has
and
the
commission
held
in
1929
that
it
didn't
have
to
because
there
is
nothing
in
the
export
rates,
the
line-haul
rates
that
requires
this
service
to
be
rendered.
therefore,
the
commission
has
required
one
railroad
to
publish
the
same
rates
to
the
same
terminal
but
not
to
render
the
services.
now,
prior
to
1951,
this
public
wharfinger
was
in
charge
of
the
facility.
he
was
an
agent
of
the
railroads.
we
didn't
just
agree
in
a
tariff
for
some
place
to
pay
him
so
much
for
doing
something.
he
was
a
railroad
agent.
the
contract,
under
which
he
acts,
is
in
the
record,
page
479.
he
agrees
to
provide
pier
space
for
the
railroad
like
their
own
pier
space.
this
is
just
a
means
of
supplementing
railroad
facilities.
instead
of
building
our
own,
we
rent
a
facility,
and
that's
what
we
do
here.
this
public
wharfinger,
who
is
in
the
nature
of
public
utility
himself,
provides
us
wharfage
space.
he
takes
charge
of
all
railroad
shipments.
he
keeps
custody.
he
agrees
to
collect
our
freight
charges.
he
agrees
to
be
liable
to
us
for
the
goods.
he
agrees
to
collect
the
published
railroad
storage
charges.
in
certain
instance,
he
retains
of
--
for
his
compensation.
in
others,
he
gives
them
to
us,
but
he
acts
for
the
railroads
in
all
respects
that
the
railroad
would
have
to
act
if
it
were
there
itself.
now,
we
pay
him
compensation,
and
we
can
pay
him
anything
we
want.
the
commission
has
no
control
over
it.
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
has
no
control
over
it.
it's
solely
a
matter
of
bargaining.
we
do
pay
him
certain
amounts
of
money
that
total
a
dollar.
and
now,
the
--
the
government
wants
us
to
pay
it
a
dollar
although
it
doesn't
purport
to
access
our
agent.
it
doesn't
purport
to
do
the
services
that
the
--
that
our
agent
does
for
us,
but
this
is
what
it
does.
prior
to
1951,
when
this
was
a
railroad
terminal,
everybody,
including
the
military,
got
the
same
service.
and
the
military
shipped
over
to
that
terminal
as
the
record
shows.
the
military
today
and
all
through
the
war
has
shipped
through
such
a
terminal
in
philadelphia
and
has
gotten
the
service.
but
the
government,
not
the
army,
the
federal
maritime
board,
dispossessed
that
public
terminal
operator
in
1951
and
split
the
terminal
into
three
parts.
one
part,
it
leased
to
the
united
states
navy.
they
don't
call
it
a
lease,
they
call
it
a
permit.
the
document
itself
is
in
the
record,
whatever
it
is.
one
third
--
no,
not
--
i'm
not
speaking
of
proportion,
but
one
proportion
went
to
the
united
states
navy.
whereupon,
the
united
states
navy,
from
that
day
to
this,
has
taken
delivery
of
its
own
shipments.
it
has
paid
the
export
rates.
it
has
not
received
nor
requested
wharfage
and
handling
allowances
and
does
not
in
this
case.
another
portion
of
the
terminal
was
turned
back
to
this
public
utility,
stevenson
&
young,
to
continue
its
operator
--
its
operation
as
a
public
facility
and
as
agent
of
the
railroad.
and
it
remains
so
until
the
army
threw
it
off
beginning
in
1953,
the
first
day
of
january
1953.
now,
what
happens
since
then,
nobody
knows
because
the
army
has
never
been
able
or
has
been
willing
to
tell
the
commission
or
a
court
how
their
case
was
changed
by
the
cessation
of
the
stevenson
&
young
operation.
but
in
any
event,
on
that
pier
operated
by
stevenson
&
young,
as
long
as
it
remained
in
existence,
and
today,
if
it
so
operated,
any
shipper,
including
the
military,
can
have
his
goods
exported
without
paying
the
published
plus
charges
because
we
absorb
them.
now,
we
do
that
for
this
reason,
the
railroads.
we
offered
to
supply
piers
in
these
ports.
it's
admitted
on
all
sizes.
we
have
no
legal
obligation
to
supply
piers,
but
we
do.
so
we
supply
piers,
and
it
happens
at
norfolk.
we
supply
more
than
adequate
piers.
this
record
shows
that
even
the
army,
when
it
took
over
its
pier,
wasn't
used
in
it
to
more
than
one
force
--
force
of
its
capacity.
there's
any
amount
of
excess
pier
term
space
down
there.
now,
what
we
don't
do
at
norfolk
or
any
other
port
is
to
make
a
rebate
to
a
shipper
who
says
he
does
not
want,
for
one
reason
or
other,
to
ship
his
goods
over
the
railroad
pier
but
he's
going
to
have
his
own
pier.
this
record
shows
who
the
big
pier
owners
are,
not
only
at
norfolk,
but
at
all
in
the
other
ports.
there
are
several
exhibits,
and
they're
only
the
big
ones,
the
standard
oils,
the
u.s.
steels,
the
armor
and
swifts,
the
ones
like
that
that
the
justice
department
would
be
watching
more
carefully
than
anybody
else
in
the
world
if
we
made
a
rebate
to
them.
there's
still
a
principle
of
law
that
says
that
when
a
railroad
is
agreeable
to
supplying
a
pier
station,
which
is
really
a
steamship
station,
it
should
be
supplied
by
the
water
carriers
rather
than
the
railroads.
but
when
we
are
willing
for
the
purpose
of
attracting
traffic
to
our
rails
and
facilitating
them
over,
when
we
are
willing
to
supply
that,
there
is
no
principle
that
we
have
to
do
something
similar
for
the
shipper
who
does
not
want
to
ship
these
goods
over
our
pier.
the
--
the
cases
are
against
that,
the
case
that
mr.
spritzer
explained,
the
atchison
case
is
against
that.
that's
the
case
that
says,
“whatever
service
or
facility,
a
railroad
has
the
duty
to
supply,
it
has
the
right
to
supply.”
and
just
in
passing,
so
that
i
don't
forget
it,
let
me
say
that
mr.
spritzer
today
attempts
to
distinguish
the
atchison
case
on
the
ground
that
it
dealt
with
transportation
service
whereas
this
is
accessorial
service.
in
the
district
court
below
in
this
case,
the
justice
department
argued
that
this
was
transportation
service,
not
accessorial
service.
it's
reversed
its
position
completely.
and
in
support
of
its
position
in
the
court
below,
it
cited
railroad
retirement
board
versus
duquesne
warehouse,
which
it
said
held
that
unloading
services
were
transportation
services.
and
it
cited
a
whole
lot
of
line
of
old
supreme
court
cases
holding
that
the
duty
of
one
railroad
to
deliver
--
of
a
railroad
to
deliver
to
a
connecting
carrier
was
a
transportation
service.
those
--
that
suited
the
kind
of
argument
what
the
government
was
making
in
--
in
the
district
court.
mr.
windsor
f.
cousins
yes.
and
a
few
minutes
ago,
when
mr.
spritzer
read
to
you
a
quotation
from
the
atchison
case,
if
he
had
only
read
on
one
sentence
further,
he
would
have
found
an
entirely
different
result
because
the
court
said
right
after
his
quotation
saying
that
one
party
or
the
other
might
have
the
right
and
duty
to
furnish
this
service
then
the
court
said,
“at
least
until
by
tariff
publication,
the
railroad
undertakes
it.”
mr.
windsor
f.
cousins
no,
i
wouldn't
defend
that.
mr.
windsor
f.
cousins
oh,
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
windsor
f.
cousins
no.
mr.
windsor
f.
cousins
neither
does
he
pay
for
it.
the
--
the
commission
found
in
this
case
on
the
facts
which
are
undisputed
of
record
because
they
were
not
only
put
in
by
the
defendant's
witnesses
but
were
admitted
by
the
army
witness
that
the
line-haul
rates
contain
no
element
or
factor
of
compensation
to
cover
these
services.
mr.
windsor
f.
cousins
the
--
mr.
windsor
f.
cousins
gets
a
--
mr.
windsor
f.
cousins
some
--
some
shippers
--
if
your
honor
please,
you
should
understand
that
the
freight
rates
are
not
published
in
a
way
that
includes
these
services.
the
tariffs
published
extra
charges
for
wharfage
and
handling.
they
are
in
addition
to
the
rate.
so
the
--
the
shipper
who
does
not
meet
certain
conditions,
which
are
described
in
a
moment,
has
to
pay
both
the
line-haul
rate
and
the
accessorial
charges
if
he
uses
the
railroad
services.
but
on
certain
export
freight,
not
all
freight,
much
is
excluded.
this
only
applies
to
a
limited
amount.
on
certain
export
freight,
the
railroads
say
they
will
waive
these
plus
charges.
in
other
words,
they
give
this
service
freight
as
closely
as
you
can
come
in
a
realistic
sense
to
free
services
because
all
they
do
when
they
say
they
will
absorb
the
charges
in
the
freight
rate,
what
they
mean
is
they
will
not
charge
these
extra
rates
for
these
services
published
in
the
tariffs.
and
here's
why
we
do
it.
this
--
this
is
the
reason
why
we
only
unload
freight
on
railroad
piers
because
this
only
applies
to
freight
that
is
interchanged
between
railroad
and
water
carrier.
this
is
freight
that
moves
with
no
great
incontinuity
from
this
country
to
a
--
to
a
foreign
destination.
when
this
practice
began,
we
issued
through
bills
of
lading
to
london,
wherever
it
went.
we
don't
do
that
anymore.
but
nevertheless,
the
rates
apply
only
to
shipments,
which
moved
from
the
railroad
to
the
vessel
without
possession
being
lost
to
the
shipper.
now,
at
the
port
on
our
piers,
somebody
has
to
make
the
interchange
from
the
car
to
the
vessel.
we
cannot
permit
the
shipper
to
come
on
the
piers
and
do
it
for
himself.
we
have
never
thought
that
was
feasible.
for
one
thing,
the
shipper
isn't
at
the
port
very
often,
so
it
has
--
the
burden
has
been
divided
off
between
the
railroad
and
the
water
carrier
that
we
unload
from
the
floor
of
the
--
from
the
car
to
the
floor
of
the
pier
and
the
vessel
picks
it
up
from
there
and
puts
it
in,
in
the
ships.
now,
the
army
doesn't
want
that
service
for
this
reason,
and
here
is
the
distinguishing
characteristic
that
prevents
a
finding
of
discrimination.
army
shipments
are
not
consigned,
like
these
commercial
export
shipments.
they
are
not
consigned
to
the
steamship
company
or
to
a
shipper's
agent.
these
military
shipments
are
consigned
to
the
army
itself
at
norfolk.
they
are
delivered
by
the
railroad,
not
to
a
vessel,
for
interchange
is
necessary.
the
railroad
never
sees
the
ship
that
takes
these
goods.
they
are
delivered
to
hauled
tracks
two
miles
back
to
the
pier
where
the
army
directs
the
railroad
to
deliver
its
shipments.
there
are
28
miles
of
track
on
this
army
base.
it's
just
exactly
like
a
big
industrial
track
dealt
with
in
the
many
switching
cases,
terminal-switching
cases.
and
the
commission
found
in
this
case,
as
it
found
in
all
those
cases,
that
when
a
railroad
makes
the
delivery
that
is
requested
and
demanded
by
the
shipper,
the
obligation
ends.
now,
there
is
no
occasion
for
us
to
unload
army
freight
because
we
don't
deliver
to
the
vessel.
it
isn't
that
kind
of
freight.
there
is
no
dealing
between
us
and
the
vessel.
the
army
wants
to
operate
its
piers
for
the
same
reason
that
the
big
shippers
want
to
operate
their
piers
because
it
finds
it
economical
to
change
the
character
of
its
freight.
its
own
witness
testified
that
the
identity
of
the
freight
was
lost
while
it
was
on
the
pier.
that
is
the
identity
between
the
rail
and
the
water
movement,
and
you
couldn't
follow
it.
mr.
windsor
f.
cousins
no,
and
that's
the
military
freight,
and
that's
the
way
the
other
big
shippers
handle
their
piers,
and
that
is
the
only
reason
why
they
have
their
piers
because
instead
of
dealing
with
their
freight
back
at
the
point
of
production,
they
find
it
convenient
and
economical
to
--
to
deal
with
their
freight
on
the
piers.
they
assemble
it.
they
breakup
loads.
they
consolidate
shipments.
the
army
processes
it.
and
then,
in
addition,
the
army
does
one
other
thing
which
big
shippers
don't
ordinarily
do,
it
wants
to
load
its
freight
in
the
ships
in
a
certain
manner.
load
these
things.
mr.
windsor
f.
cousins
the
army
pays
the
export
rate
because
of
a
concession
made
for
the
railroads.
they're
not
entitled
to
it
under
their
normal
tariffs
because
there
isn't
continuity.
it
isn't
export
shipments
in
the
--
in
the
tariff
sense.
but
during
the
war,
at
the
request
of
the
secretaries
and
the
army
and
the
navy,
the
railroads
in
the
east,
not
in
the
west,
the
railroads
in
the
east
published
special
export
rates
applicable
to
these
shipments
moving
over
military
bases.
it
was
necessary
to
give
them
a
special
provision
because
the
regular
one
wouldn't
cover.
that's
where
we
made
our
mistake.
we
gave
this
as
a
concession
to
the
government
for
shipments
that
wouldn't
comply
with
the
tariffs
and
ever
since
then,
the
justice
department
has
been
trying
to
turn
it
against
us
and
get
a
second
concession
based
on
the
first.
at
pacific
coast
ports,
the
--
the
western
railroads
refused
the
secretaries
of
those
departments
those
rates.
and
--
mr.
windsor
f.
cousins
yes
and
no.
if
their
--
if
shipments
move
over
their
pier
direct
to
the
steamship
with
no
interference
up
by
them,
they
get
the
export
rates.
if
the
shipment
stop
in
their
hands,
delivered
to
them
as
to
the
army,
they
pay
the
domestic
rates,
which
are
much
higher.
mr.
windsor
f.
cousins
the
bills
of
lading
are
entirely
different,
your
honor,
because
contrary
to
what
was
said
here
today
because
the
government
always
uses
a
special
form
of
bill
of
lading.
mr.
windsor
f.
cousins
straight
from
the
car
--
mr.
windsor
f.
cousins
--
from
the
car
to
the
ship,
yes.
mr.
windsor
f.
cousins
yes.
mr.
windsor
f.
cousins
oh,
yes.
mr.
windsor
f.
cousins
yes,
it
has
to
be
consigned
for
export.
it
required
some.
and
if
i
may
have
the
indulgence
to
finish
one
sentence
i
began.
mr.
windsor
f.
cousins
when
i
said
that
the
western
railroads
refused
to
make
this
concession,
which
we
made
and
got
us
into
this
fix
where
we
have
not
tried
this
case
in
one
place
or
another
12
times
after
they
refused
to
do
it
and
the
army
didn't
get
the
service
out
there,
they
brought
a
complaint
and
the
commission
held
that
it
was
not
unreasonable
or
otherwise
unlawful
for
them
to
have
refused
to
do
it.
thank
you,
your
honor.
