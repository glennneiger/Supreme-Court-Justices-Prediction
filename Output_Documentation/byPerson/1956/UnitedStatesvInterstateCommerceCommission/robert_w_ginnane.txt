mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
sharing
my
time
with
mr.
cousins,
who
will
argue
on
behalf
of
the
railroad
carriers
who
are
(inaudible)
in
this
case.
before
going
into
the
facts
which
has
--
my
brother
says
are
essentially
undisputed,
so
i
shall
not
have
occasion
to
repeat
them
at
any
length.
i'd
like
to
review
briefly
some
of
the
principles
which
are
involved
in
this
field.
as
you've
been
told,
it's
the
general
rule
in
the
united
states
that
shippers
are
required
to
load
and
consignees
are
required
to
unload
carload
freight.
however,
it
has
also
been
held
by
the
commission
and
by
this
court
that
without
any
change
in
their
line-haul
rates,
railroads
may
assume
an
obligation
to
provide
loading
services
under
their
tariffs.
of
course,
if
they
do
so,
all
the
shippers
in
the
same
circumstances
must
be
treated
alike.
export
freight
as
distinguished
from
domestic
freight
requires
the
use
of
ports
or
piers
upon
which
freight
can
be
moved
and
up
--
and
to
which
the
freight
can
be
unloaded
within
reach
of
ships
tackle.
railroads
have
no
legal
duty
to
--
to
provide
such
wharfage
and
unloading
services
for
export
freight.
but
for
many
years,
they
have
customarily
provided
such
services.
these
services
may,
as
they
are
in
--
in
some
parts
of
the
united
states,
they
may
be
stated
separately
as
--
as
separate
charges
apart
from
the
line-haul
rate,
or
they
may
be
furnished
without
any
additional
stated
charge
in
addition
to
the
line-haul
rate.
in
getting
to
this
case,
the
railroads
which
serve
the
north
atlantic
ports,
that's
from
hampton
roads
including
norfolk
north,
have,
for
some
years,
preceding
1929,
i
couldn't
give
an
exact
date,
followed
the
practice
of
providing
such
wharfage
and
handling
services
on
export
freight
without
establishing
or
collecting
a
separate
charge
in
addition
to
the
line-haul
rates.
this
practice
grew
out
an
extensive
background
or
i
should
almost
say
a
delicate
background
of
competition
not
only
between
carriers
and
between
ports.
that
history
is
and
much
of
the
justification
is
set
forth
at
some
length
in
a
report
to
the
commission
entitled
“wharfage
charges
at
atlantic
and
gulf
ports”
in
1929.
now,
railroads
provide
such
--
often
provide
such
wharfage
and
handling
services
on
their
own
piers
with
their
own
personnel,
or
where
they
do
not
own
such
piers,
they
will
contract
with
commercial
terminal
operators
or
with
municipally
owned
pier
operators
and
to
provide
such
services
as
agents
for
the
railroad.
the
railroads
have
served
the
north
atlantic
ports,
including
norfolk,
which
is
involved
here,
have
never
undertaken
to
provide
such
services
on
all
of
the
export
freight
as
the
tariffs
in
the
record
on
this
case
show.
they
have
for
reasons
almost
of
this
on
their
face,
not
provided
such
services
for
specified
types
of
cargo
for
grain,
bulk
liquids
and
tankers,
whether
they
don't
provide
it
unless
the
inbound
freight
rate
is
equal
to
a
certain
amount,
in
the
case
of
the
tariffs
in
this
case,
unless
it's
at
least
19
cents
a
hundred
pounds.
and
moreover,
the
north
atlantic
--
the
carrier
serving
the
north
atlantic
ports
do
not
provide
such
services
on
export
freight
delivered
to
the
private
pier
of
the
shipper
or
consignee,
unless,
as
mr.
spritzer
has
pointed
out,
the
tariff
involved
in
this
case
specifically
provides
that
the
railroads
will
furnish
wharfage
and
handling
services
only
on
export
freight
which
is
delivered
to
the
vessel
by
rail
or
for
both
properties
owned
or
leased
by
stevenson
&
young
and
operated
by
that
company
as
a
public
terminal
facilities
of
railroads
and
only
when
stevenson
&
young
performs
such
services
as
agent
for
the
railroads.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
at
least
since
1929,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
--
i
can't
--
it
was
going
on
before
that.
i
can't
pinpoint
the
date
prior
to
1929.
now,
the
army
freight
shipments
involved
in
this
case,
after
prior
rail
transportation,
moved
over
army
piers
1
and
2
at
the
army
base
at
norfolk.
prior
to
may
1,
1951,
these
piers
are
leased
by
the
government
to
the
firm
of
stevenson
&
young.
and
stevenson
&
young,
during
the
same
period,
had
turned
around
and
entered
into
this
contract
for
the
railroads
to
operate
these
pier
facilities,
wharf
and
unloading
facilities
as
a
public
terminal
of
the
railroads,
and
they
contract
it
for
$1
a
ton
to
provide
wharfage
and
handling
facilities
on
export
freight
as
agent
of
the
railroads.
i
should
emphasize
that
this
dollar
a
ton
was
the
actual
complete
payment
to
stevenson
&
young
for
these
services.
it
was
not
just
an
allowance
toward
the
cost
of
the
services.
it
was
the
complete
payment
for
the
services
and
the
shipper
was
not
billed
for
anything
additional
or
separately
for
those
services.
and
during
this
period,
prior
to
may
1,
1951,
the
railroads
paid
this
$1
a
ton
for
wharfage
and
handling
to
the
stevenson
&
young
on
both
commercial
export
freight
and
upon
the
army's
military
export
freight.
on
may
1,
1951,
the
government
took
possession
of
its
piers,
except
that
what
the
commission
described
and
it's
not
challenged,
at
least
i
don't
think
it
is,
a
very
limited
portion
of
the
facilities
was
made
available,
left
available
to
stevenson
&
young
where
it
continued
to
handle
commercial
freight.
and
on
this
portion
of
the
facilities
which
was
thus
left
available
to
stevenson
&
young
for
handling
commercial
freight,
stevenson
&
young
continued
to
act
as
agents
for
the
carriers
and
performed
--
continued
to
perform
this
wharfage
and
handling
service
on
commercial
export
shipments
for
a
$1
a
ton.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
only
if
--
only
if
they
were
under
such
a
contract
with
the
--
with
the
railroads
at
those
piers.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it's
admitted
at
--
in
norfolk.
there
are
ample
other
pier
facilities.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
to
handle
all
private
shipments
and
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
and
all
of
the
government
freight
here
involved.
in
other
words,
during
this
period,
norfolk
had
a
surplus
of
pier
wharfage
and
handling
facility.
i
might
say
that
that
is
in
contrast
with
the
situation
which
existed
during
world
war
ii,
a
period
covered
by
the
--
by
the
first
norfolk
case.
in
that
case,
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
was
significantly
impressed
by
the
fact
that
during
world
war
ii,
the
volume
of
traffic,
military
traffic
going
to
norfolk
was
so
great
that
there
did
not
exist
other
pier
facilities
available
to
the
railroads
which
could
have
handled
the
traffic.
the
situation
is
different
here.
the
commission
has
found
and
has
not
challenged
that
the
base
--
that
the
pier
facilities
leaving
aside
army
piers
1
and
2
were
more
than
adequate
to
handle
all
the
traffic,
commercial
and
military,
going
through
the
base
during
the
period
following
--
going
to
the
port
during
the
period
following
may
1,
1951.
the
commission's
detailed
report
contains
the
following.
we
believe
are
critical
findings
of
fact,
which
are
not
challenged.
first,
that
on
the
night
of
may
1,
1951
and
up
to
the
date
of
the
commission's
hearing,
only
commercial
traffic
for
export
was
handled
over
port
properties
leased
by
stevenson
&
young
and
operated
by
stevenson
&
young
as
a
terminal
facility
of
the
railroads.
secondly,
that
no
military
traffic
was
stored
on
or
handled
over
any
form
of
property
under
a
lease
or
permit
to
stevenson
&
young
for
commercial
traffic
at
any
time
during
that
period.
but
rather,
all
such
export
military
traffic
after
delivery
to
the
base
was
in
the
possession
of
and
under
the
exclusive
control
of
the
army.
it
was
handled
over
port
facilities
under
exclusive
permit
of
the
army
and
the
unloading
services
were
performed
by
labor
furnished
by
the
agent
of
the
army,
stevenson
&
young,
by
the
agent
of
the
army
and
not
by
the
agent
for
the
rail
carriers.
and
the
commission
also
found,
as
i
just
indicated,
that
the
railroad
serving
the
norfolk
port
area
had
had
available
port
facilities
more
than
ample
to
handle
all
the
military
traffic
moving
over
the
army
base
at
norfolk
at
least
since
may
1,
1951.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
page
21
of
the
record.
as
your
honors
have
heard,
the
commission
also
found
that
there
was
a
substantial
difference
between
the
handling
of
commercial
export
traffic
by
the
railroads
and
the
manner
in
which
the
army's
military
export
freight
was
handled.
this
finding
was
based
upon
the
--
the
testimony
of
--
of
the
army's
own
witnesses
on
such
matter
as
the
complexity
of
the
army's
freight
operation,
including
pre-storage
planning,
the
nature
of
the
overseas
requirements,
extra
documentation
and
so
on.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no.
at
this
stage
in
--
at
this
stage
of
the
case,
the
government
does
not
ask
that
the
railroads
perform.
they
don't
ask
for
performance.
they
ask
only
for
the
dollar
allowance.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right.
the
piers
were
not
under
control
of
the
shipper,
in
this
case,
the
army.
so
that
the
--
so
that
the
railroads
could
perform
this
wharfage
unloading
services
at
their
convenience,
rather
than
at
the
shipper's
convenience,
the
government
as
the
shipper
would
be
entitled
to
this
dollar
allowance.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
perhaps,
i
can
answer
the
question
best
this
way.
farrell,
the
managing
director
for
stevenson
&
young,
was
asked
if
he
would
do
for
the
army,
what
they
would
do
for
a
dollar,
what
he
was
doing
for
the
army
for
287,
at
least
not
by
land.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
fact
that
--
that
the
army
base
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
the
core
of
the
commission's
case
was
that
the
–
that
--
the
core
of
the
commission's
position
in
dismissing
the
army's
complaint
was
that
no
private
shipper
in
the
possession
of
the
army
here
would
get
–
would
get
an
allowance
of
a
dollar
for
performing
these
services
for
itself.
the
commission's
position
was,
basic
position,
the
army
here,
so
far
as
the
law
is
concerned,
is
in
the
position
of
a
private
shipment
insisting
upon
receiving
its
export
freight
at
its
own
pier.
a
private
shipper,
in
--
in
no
circumstance,
would
not
get
an
allowance
for
performing
the
services
for
its
own.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
universal
practice
(inaudible)
and
may
i
say
that
when
--
when
the
private
--
when
the
big
oil
company
or
big
shipper,
because
only
big
shippers
have
their
own
piers,
and
he
decides
to
take
delivery
at
his
private
pier
and
therefore
not
get
the
benefit
of
--
of
its
wharfage
and
handling
charges,
he
does
it,
not
as
a
matter
of
whim,
but
for
rather
compelling
reasons.
for
example,
it
may
be
involved
substantial
periods
of
storage
before
the
goods
moved
out
by
ship.
so
he
--
he
may
desire
to
--
to
store
the
good
--
goods
on
his
own
pier
instead
of
paying
the
railroad
storage
charges
or
in
many
cases,
he
wanted
to
unload,
reassemble,
perhaps
repack
the
goods,
those
are
the
--
to
do
those
things,
he
has
to
--
he
has
to
take
possession
of
the
export
shipment
and
practically
have
his
own
facilities.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
same
rate.
that's
right.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
with
--
with
--
without
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
he
would
not
get
the
dollar.
he
would
get
neither
the
services
nor
payment
or
an
allowance
from
service.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
may
be
so.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
that
question
was
never
litigated
in
this
case.
now,
the
--
the
government
talks
quite
a
bit
about
it
in
their
reply
brief
for
the
first
time.
no
such
question
was
litigated
before
the
commission.
and
the
commission's
original
decision
in
1929,
which
it
held
that
it
would
permit
carriers
to
provide
these
services
under
the
line-haul
rate
instead
of
require
them
to
file
and
publish
separate
charges
for
it,
that
the
--
while
the
secretary
of
the
army
appeared
in
that
proceeding,
the
commission's
proceeding
--
the
commission's
decision
was
never
challenged
in
the
court.
and
as
i
say,
the
question
was
not
raised
and
litigated
here
either
before
the
commission
or
before
the
court
below.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
they
disclaimed
it,
both
in
their
main
brief
and
in
their
reply
brief.
they
say,
“we
do
not
challenge
that
they
put
up
the
dichotomy
of
the
public-private
--
public
pier-private
pier
dichotomy.”
"always
says,"
says
the
government,
"is
that
we,
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
are
entitled
to
different
treatment
than
the
private
shipper
in
the
same
circumstances
would
get."
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
gulf
refining
company,
imperial
tobacco
company
and
so
on.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
i
--
i
have
to
--
the
--
the
terms
of
the
tariff,
i
first
needed
to
avoid
you
there,
the
tariff
provides
that
the
railroads
will
not
absorb
as
it
were
these
wharfage
and
unloading
charges
on
commodities
of
freight
cars.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
a
separate
provision
in
the
--
in
the
tariff
which
is
not
being
litigated
in
the
case.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
the
law
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
imperial
tobacco
company.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
if
they
so
specify
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
there
--
there
title
to
specify
it.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
is
not
absorbed
by
the
railroad.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
can
only
say
it
is
my
understanding.
i
have
seen
nothing
that
--
that
would
contradict
it
that
where
the
shipper
--
where
--
where
the
shipper
specify
the
delivery
at
his
private
pier,
the
railroads
did
not
absorb
it.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
so
far
as
i
know,
that's
a
universal
practice.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it's
in
this
record
again
and
again
without
contradiction
from
the
appellant's
witnesses,
army
traffic
witnesses.
that
is
their
understanding
of
--
of
a
railroad's
tariff
practices
that
if
export
shipment
is
delivered
to
the
shipper's
private
pier
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
that
they
did
not
take
these
allowances.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
believe
there's
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
for
good
business
reasons
such
as
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
paying
their
own
storage
charges,
the
opportunity
to
resort
or
otherwise
process
the
goods
which
they
could
not
do
if
--
if
the
export
freight
was
delivered
at
a
public
or
railroad
pier
and
later
ride
along
side
this
feature.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right.
imperial
can
have
--
can
--
can
have
delivery
of
its
export
shipment
of
tobacco.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
in
freight,
i
don't
know,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
say
i
do
not
know
whether
--
what
is
--
in
fact
is
practiced
over
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
commission
--
as
--
in
fact,
i
do
not
know
whether
it
is
necessary
for
--
for
the
imperial
tobacco
company
to
take
delivery
at
a
--
at
a
private
pier.
mr.

what
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
what
the
commission
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it's
--
it's
often
a
great
imports,
the
important
convenience
to
private
shippers
to
--
to
receive
export
shipments
at
their
piers
so
--
for
their
convenience,
for
their
reason.
they
can
do
things
to
the
freight
that
they
couldn't
do
if
it
were
delivered
on
a
public
pier
unloaded
right
beside
the
ship,
storage
for
their
own
purposes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
line-haul
rate
adjustment
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
line-haul
rates
of
these
railroads
would
serve
the
north
atlantic
ports
to
absorb
the
wharfage
and
unloading
charges
except
where
the
freight
is
delivered
to
the
shipper's
private
pier.
the
freight
--
the
export,
where
it
is
delivered
to
the
shipper's
private
pier,
the
railroads
do
not,
under
these
tariffs,
absorb
the
wharfage
and
handling
charges.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
if
it
--
if
it
delivered
its
--
its
freight
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
delivered
its
freight
to
that
portion
of
government
piers
1
and
2,
which
are
being
operated
by
stevenson
&
young
under
permit
as
a
--
as
a
public
terminal
facility
for
the
railroads,
they
would
--
they
would
get
the
$1
allowance.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
government
would
not
because
it
takes
exclusive
possession
and
control
of
its
freight
for
its
convenience
under
the
portions
of
the
piers.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it's
the
same
as
--
separate
piers
were
involved.
it's
just
an
accident
in
this
case
that
--
that
the
same
two
piers
--
portions
of
the
same
two
piers
are
used
partly
for
commercial
freight,
partly
for
military
freight.
the
terms
of
principle,
the
legal
problem
involved,
the
question
--
the
issue
is
--
is
--
i
--
the
same.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
as
for
their
--
at
one
pier,
at
a
railroad
pier,
it
was
absorbing,
on
commercial
shipments,
these
wharfage
and
handling
charges,
but
it
was
refusing
to
do
so
at
the
next
pier
over
here
where
the
army
is
insisting
upon
receiving
its
own
freight
and
is
insisting
that
the
wharfage
and
handling
services
be
--
be
performed
at
its
convenience
rather
than
the
railroads'
convenience
as
in
the
case
of
the
first
pier
which
is
controlled
by
the
railroad.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
doubt
it.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
--
i
would
doubt,
your
honor,
if
there
is
a
major
seaport
whether
or
not
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
both
public
and
private
piers.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
but
i
doubt
it.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
that
question
is
here.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
--
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
that
arrangement
is
satisfactory
with
a
great
majority
of
shipper.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
--
the
government
is
one
of
them.
as
the
commission
found,
it
had
special
needs
which
could
not
be
satisfied
by
the
routine,
regular
wharfage
and
handling
services.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
provided
by
the
railroads
under
the
tariff.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
because
that
is
not
a
service
which
the
government
provides.
and
even
look
at
in
that
point
of
view,
we
--
and
that
the
government
--
the
shipper,
the
army
as
a
shipper
is
still
in
the
position
of
a
private
shipper.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
because
the
private
shippers
will
--
will
decline
to
take
advantage
of
the
services
off
within
the
line-haul
rate,
again,
only
for
special
compelling
practical
reasons
where
--
where
they
can
do
so,
they
do.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
long
ago,
the
commission
held
that
for
the
railroads
to
offer
under
the
line-haul
rates
these
services,
available,
but
not
to
private
shippers
who
received
--
not
available
to
private
shippers,
who,
for
their
own
practical
reasons,
chose
to
receive
their
freight
at
their
private
piers,
held
that
that
was
a
reasonable
practice.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
that
has
not
been
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
and
that
has
not
been
challenged
in
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
would
have
to
admit
in
--
in
all
honesty
that
the
earlier
controversies
before
the
commission,
relating
to
this
practice,
have
consisted
of
various
private
warehouse
--
houses
trying
to
get
--
trying
to
get
the
benefit
--
trying
to
get
treated
as
in
--
the
same
--
trying
to
be
--
kept
the
commission
to
hold
that
they
must
be
allowed.
they
must
be
permitted
by
the
railroads
to
perform
for
them
these
--
these
terminal
services.
now,
the
precise
question
which
--
which
your
honor
has
asked
has
not
been
in
the
forefront
of
this
earlier
administrative
litigation.
and
it
has
not
--
it
is
not
been
litigated
here
before
the
commission
or
in
the
court
below.
the
government
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
disavows
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
pardon?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
think
all
is
necessarily
involved.
it's
--
it's
the
claim
which
the
government
presents
to
the
court.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
they
say
--
and
they
say
that
--
that
they
disavow
any
quarrel
of
what
they
call
private
pier,
public
pier
dichotomy.
and
they
say,
“we're
different.
we're
different
from
the
private
shippers.”
they
say,
“we're
different
because
we're
the
government
and
because
we
were
dealing
with
national
defense
needs.”
in
their
main
brief,
the
only
authority
they
cited
for
this
claim
of
difference
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
the
majority
of
the
commission
took
a
contrary
position
as
you
know.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
they
relied
heavily
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
thought
it
was
not
unreasonable
here.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
oh,
i
think
i
have
to
answer
you
yes
because
the
commission
on
the
wharfage
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
because
the
commission
on
wharfage
case
merely
said
that
--
that
the
carriers
might
add
service
charge.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
didn't
say
they
must.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
the
government
is
not
here
asserting.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
--
that
the
charges
should
be
separately
stated.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
they
don't
care
what
happens
to
other
--
to
--
to
truly
private
shippers.
they
say
they
don't.
they
say,
“we
want
separate
and
distinct
treatment,
treatment
which
we
will
assume,”
they
say,
“that
no
private
shipper
would
be
entitled
to”.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
--
it's
very
--
it
--
it
--
that
may
very
well
be
so
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
and
that
was
obviously
said
that
they
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
that
was
obviously
the
--
the
apprehension
of
the
carriers
down
the
norfolk
area
when
they
were
asked
for
this
back
in
1951.
they
were
afraid
that
it
would
spread.
and
--
and
the
commission
agreed
to
them
because
the
commission
--
the
--
the
commission
held
in
this
case
that
for
the
--
that
for
the
carriers
to
make
such
an
allowance
to
the
government
as
a
shipper,
while
not
making
such
an
allowance
to
private
shippers
in
the
same
circumstances,
would
be
a
--
would
be
a
discrimination,
a
deviation
from
--
from
tariffs
in
violation
of
section
6.
the
commission
relied
heavily
in
what
we
think
is
the
persuasive
analogy
of
the
switching
cases
as
decided
by
the
commission
and
with
the
approval
of
this
court.
in
brief,
in
those
cases,
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
line-haul
rates
generally
include
delivery
to
shippers
and
delivery,
among
other
things,
usually
includes
delivery
at
the
unloading
point
on
a
shipper's
spur
per
switch.
but
in
the
case
of
large
industrial
shippers,
the
commission
found
where
there
are
many
loading
and
unloading
points
within
--
within
the
--
the
limits
of
the
shipper's
plant,
the
commission
held,
and
this
court
sustained
its
decision,
that
this
duty
to
deliver
under
the
line-haul
rates
did
not
include
delivery
beyond
and
--
beyond
an
uninterrupted
movement
at
the
carrier's
convenience
which
usually
meant
that
the
line-haul
obligation
seized
to
interchange
tracks
at
the
--
at
the
beginning
of
the
plant
limits.
the
principle
of
those
cases
was
that
if
a
shipper's
convenience
is
interposed
to
prevent
terminal
services
at
the
carrier's
convenience,
then
the
carrier
is
relieved
of
obligation
even
to
perform
a
service
or
to
make
an
allowance
to
the
shipper
for
doing
so.
and
--
and
we
think
that
that
principle
long
applied
by
the
commission
and
by
the
--
by
the
courts
applies
here.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
that
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it's
--
i
--
it
seems
to
me
that
similar
possibilities
exist
here.
the
railroads
get
in
the
business
of
making
allowances
for
wharfage
to
big
shippers.
i
say
big
shippers
because
only
big
shippers,
who
have
lots
of
traffic
to
dispose
of,
operate
pier
--
operate
private
piers.
and
that
--
and
that's
been
the
sort
of
situation
which
has
led
to
various
types
of
discriminatory
practices
in
the
--
in
the
history
of
american
railroads.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right
and
--
and
where
--
because
the
necessities
of
the
business,
they
want
to
do
things
to
the
freight
that
they
couldn't
do
in
the
ordinary
wharfage
and
handling
services
provided
by
carriers.
i
think
we
should
assume
that
a
private
shipper
takes
delivery
at
his
private
pier
only
for
what
seemed
to
him
to
be
pretty
compelling
reasons
which
more
than
offset
what
he
losses
by
--
by
not
receiving
absorption
of
this
wharfage
and
unloading
charges.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
wouldn't
be
just
whim.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
when
that
issue
was
before
the
commission
in
1929,
sir,
it
became
very
clear
that
in
the
background
of
the
system
of
--
of
a
terminal
charge
absorption
in
the
line-haul
rate,
whether
or
not
that
should
be
permitted,
involved
intense
delicate
factors
of
competition.
i
mean
such
a
port
as
new
york
with
its
unique
and
heavy-lightweight
charges
in
philadelphia,
boston,
norfolk
and
baltimore.
in
other
words,
lurking
under
the
--
under
these
and
--
related
cases,
it's
probably
the
most
controversial
delicate
problem
in
transportation
that
has
ever
been
put
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
or
before
congress,
the
competition
in
these
north
atlantic
seaports.
thank
you.
