what
you
say
--
what
you
say
is
that
--
your
position
has
been
that
if
tariff
applies
that
the
railroads
will
absorb
the
wharfage
and
handling
charges
where
a
company
owned
by
the
railroad,
wharfage
company
owned
by
the
railroad
are
run
by
its
agents,
does
the
working
--
justice
hugo
l.

--
and
no
other.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
it,
they
insisted
about
the
different
(inaudible)
i
have
been
enlightened
maybe
--
what
justice
frankfurter
said,
it
seems
to
me
the
difference.
the
rail
--
the
government
says
that
while
the
railroads
have
provided
for
such
an
absorption
of
charges
for
the
ordinary
shipment,
that
its
shipments
are
certain
that
it's
fully
impossible
for
the
government
to
take
advantage
of
that
absorption
of
wharfage
and
handling
charges
and
he
relies
on
findings
that
that
is
certain.
now,
if
that's
true,
is
it
--
does
the
railroad
has
the
right
to
enter
to
the
wharfage
business
for
such
a
limited
character
that
they
can
give
it
to
some
shippers
who
could
utilize
and
deny
it
to
others
when
the
government
will
not
supply
them
the
kind
of
--
cannot
supply
them
the
kind
of
service
they
need?
is
that
question
here?
you
say
that
question
is
not
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
that
question
is
here
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
how
do
you
answer
the
argument?
maybe
you
can,
i
want
to
hear
it.
how
do
you
answer
this
argument?
if
you
have
findings
that
the
government
must
ship
so
--
its
--
its
nature
that
it
would
do
it
no
good,
it
just
can't
take
it
bad
and
you
put
the
railroads
off,
but
others
can.
the
railroads
offer
either
through
their
own
wharfage
and
handling
agencies
or
through
an
agent
to
survive
or
to
absorb
the
wharfage
charge,
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
but
it
is
not
--
some
of
them
cannot
take
advantage.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
government
being
one
of
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
stated
in
another
way,
it
had
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it
had
special
demand
that
although
the
government
--
although
the
railroads
are
providing
that
those
who
do
not
have
special
demands
can
get
their
line-haul
freight
reduced.
those
who
have
special
demand
can
neither
get
their
line-haul
reduced
nor
get
absorption
of
wharfage
rates.
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
undoubtedly,
i
--
i
would
say
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
a
private
--
if
a
private
shipper
--
one
--
the
question
i
asked
in
relation
to
the
government
law,
if
a
private
shipper,
by
reason
of
some
special
situation
that
it
has
to
meet
the
connection
with
its
--
it's
commodity,
cannot
possibly
take
advantage
of
your
railroad
--
of
the
wharfage
companies
that
the
railroad
will
absorb,
if
it
cannot
do
it,
it
would
be
in
precisely
the
same
situation
that
the
--
the
commission
has
found
the
government
knew,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
of
course,
there'd
be
no
more
reason
to
grant
the
--
just
merely
the
fact
that
the
government
wouldn't
give
it
any
right,
but
it
gets
down
to
a
question,
does
it
not,
whether
the
railroad,
which
is
primarily
in
the
railroad
business,
can
provide
that
for
line-haul
charges
to
shippers,
it
provides
some
service
for
those
who
can
take
advantage
of
it
and
will
absorb
the
charges
but
declines
to
provide
that
services
that
--
that
absorb
that
rate
or
to
absorb
the
rate
or
refund
it
for
shippers
who
need
the
wharfage
services
just
as
much
but
are
unable
to
utilize
the
services
of
the
companies
that
the
railroad
has
approved?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
did
it
hold?
did
have
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
port?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
it
litigate
in
that
case
or
was
it
litigated
or
decided
or
would
agree
that
there
were
some
shippers
who
wanted
to
haul
and
had
to
haul
on
that
line-haul
service
but
who
could
not
possibly
take
advantage
of
the
railroad
wharfage
and
handling
matters
and
who
would
thereby,
in
the
long
run,
be
compelled
if
they
were
line-haul
charge
than
those
who
are
more
fortunate?
was
that
litigated
in
the
case
you're
talking
about?
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
it
necessarily
involved?
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
it
necessarily
involved?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
not
necessarily
involved?
maybe
it's
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
this
is
all
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
take
it
personally.
i
don't
think
it's
any
of
all
that.
but
commissioner
aldrich
took
the
position
that
the
act
itself
requires
that
it
be
not
rates
fixed
which
result
in
effecting
an
unfair
charge
or
--
or
unfairly
making
some
shippers
pay
more
than
others
for
the
same
line-haul
service.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what
it
indicated
is
it
was
litigated
and
determined
that
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
some
that
operates
private
piers
or
sort
of
peculiar
type
of
business
they
have
they
--
they
hold
in
their
piers
just
to
provide
the
kind
of
services
they
need.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
there's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
be
in
which
it
depends
on
reasonableness
and
fairness,
which
i
state
in
advance
might
be
an
issue
that
the
commission
would
have
to
decide,
the
reasonableness
and
fairness.
why
would
it
be
fair
to
impose
a
heavier
charge
in
effect
to
railroads
for
transporting
goods
from
one
place
to
another
than
some
other
goods,
which
are
such
nature
that
the
person
has
to
handle
its
--
its
--
forfeit
himself?
that
seems
a
little
difficult.
when
you
take
it
back
and
make
them
pay
more
for
carrying
the
goods
because
of
the
peculiar
nature,
i
think
there
are
quite
a
number
of
businesses
in
the
country
that
do
manufacture
and
ship
commodities
that
is
called
for
special
services,
but
each
one
is
entitled,
i
should
suppose,
to
a
fair
railroad
rate
without
regard
to
the
fact
that
the
peculiar
type
of
the
commodity
requires
different
type
of
handling.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you?
suppose
your
tariff,
let's
say,
use
this
language
instead
of
the
other,
maybe
--
maybe
i'm
wrong
in
thinking
it
means
the
same
thing
but
(inaudible)
suppose
the
tariff
said
that
all
shippers
who
ship
goods
between
points
in
certain
districts
shall
pay
90
cents
a
hundred
if
after
the
goods
to
get
to
the
norfolk,
they
use
the
wharfage
--
take
the
wharfage
services
supplied
by
the
railroad
but
all
who
do
not
take
the
wharfage
services
could
be
a
dollar
per
hundred?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
isn't
that
the
effect
of
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
--
if
the
person
that
uses
your
wharfage
gets
a
dollar's
worth
of
service,
10
cents
you
say
and
reduces
it
to
90
cents
or
whatever
it
is,
but
the
man
who
doesn't
use
your
service,
doesn't
get
the
line-haul
reduced.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
what's
the
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what's
it
for?
justice
hugo
l.
black
one
of
them
gets
the
service
and
one
of
them
doesn't.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
one
that
doesn't
get
the
services,
it
cost
him
more
to
get
his
goods
to
ship
than
the
other.
