mr.
davis,
are
you
ready?
justice
william
o.
douglas
wasn't
that
the
--
their
question
was
the
same
one
that
was
here
in
1950?
justice
william
o.
douglas
we
denied
certiorari.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
wasn't
that
single
question
presented
on
a
petition?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
was
later
--
that
was
later
i
think.
i
think
this
--
this
question
is
presented
in
the
summer
of
1950
to
this
court?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
was
on
a
petition
for
a
certiorari
to
denial
i
think
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
which
got
to
the
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
question
of
jurisdiction.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
he
--
he
expressly
waived
counsel
at
the
trial,
didn't
he?
justice
william
o.
douglas
he
conducted
his
own
defense?
justice
william
o.
douglas
did
he
ask
that
counsel
be
appointed
to
represent
him
in
--
in
this
matter
of
the
record?
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
is
a
very
different
thing
that
he
was
refused
the
presence
of
counsel
of
his
selection.
justice
william
o.
douglas
when
did
he
write
the
letter
about
him
getting
a
copy
of
those
records?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
he
had
the
chance
to
go
to
the
whole
testimony.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
now,
all
that
is
held
against
him
though,
isn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
they're
finding
against
chessman,
on
those
things?
on
the
discrepancies
as
to
his
own
testimony
that
that
all
came
out
at
the
trial
did
it
not?
i
mean
it's
here.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
that's
--
that
was
what
we
sent
to
him
to
hear.
justice
william
o.
douglas
can
this
be
all
--
can
this
counsel
by
the
supreme
court
of
california
back
in
1950?
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
i
mean
is
to
what
actually
happened
in
the
report
in
35
federal
california
second,
page
455.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
we
can
look
to
that
to
see
what
happened,
can't
we?
justice
william
o.
douglas
according
to
that
report,
the
transcript
as
reconstructed
was
sent
to
chessman.
chessman
objected,
made
objections.
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
that
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
some
of
his
objections
were
sustained,
is
that
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
some
were
not?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
is
the
fact
that
he
wasn't
allowed
to
be
there
in
person.
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
the
supreme
--
supreme
court
of
california
considered
that
and
said
that
there
maybe
inaccuracies,
but
none
of
them
were
prejudicial.
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
those
facts
again,
are
those
new
startling
facts
or
what?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that's
what
the
california
court
held
as
a
matter
of
california
law.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
think
the
judge
had
been
--
dissented
in
the
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
california
law
as
i
understand
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
this
case,
the
court
held
that
the
record
wasn't
filed.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
there
are
some
of
us
who
would
like
to
hear
you.
