justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
say
mr.
davis
that
he
was
denied
the
right
to
have
counsel
at
the
--
present
at
time
with
the
settlement
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
meaning
as
a
--
as
a
fact?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
was
he
offered
an
opportunity
to
have
counsel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
was
interested
in
knowing
whether
he
had
requested
counsel
to
represent
him.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
chessman
know
any
of
these
things
whether
or
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
chessman
know
any
of
these
things
whether
or
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
when
did
he
first
learn
that
fraser's
employ
and
appointment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
date
is
when?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
did
he
have
copies
of
these
applications
for
extension
of
time,
for
example?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you're
telling
us
that
he
never
received
any
official
or
formal
notice
of
fraser's
employment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
when
did
he
learn
of
fraser's
employment,
and
how?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
you
said
that
he
knew
of
the
relation
between
leavy
and
fraser?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
he
know
that
before
the
case
got
before
the
california
supreme
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
the
record
show
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
the
california
supreme
court
has
never
officially
had
from
him
any
complaint
based
upon
the
alleged
relations
between
fraser
and
leavy.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
the
--
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
in
the
first
--
that
was
in
the
35
california.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
bennett,
may
i
ask?
was
there
an
open
court
hearing
and
to
settle
the
record
before
it
was
sent
to
chessman?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
any
notice
to
chessman
that
that
proceeding
was
being
held?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
a
later
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
was
he
given
any
opportunity
as
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
that
appear
to
be
represented
at
either
of
those?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
bennett,
may
i
ask
one
other
question
as
to
the
fact?
does
it
appear
that
judge
fricke
gave
any
--
does
it
appear
affirmatively
in
the
record
that
we
have
before
us
that
judge
fricke
gave
consideration
to
whether
or
not,
chessman
should
be
represented
either
by
counsel
or
in
person
at
the
settlement
hearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
what
appears
in
that
regard?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
paraphrase
it,
don't
bother
though.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
do
you
read
that
--
do
you
read
that
as
in
the
fact
saying
that
having
refused
of
the
assistance
of
counsel
during
his
trial,
we
must
assume
that
he
would
still
refuse
the
assistance
of
counsel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
--
that
during
the
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
does
it
appear
that
he
said
repeated
that
in
connection
with
the
--
these
proceedings
or
was
that
really
assumed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
no
one
ever
asked
him
whether
he
changed
his
mind?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
in
the
settlement
of
this
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
trying
to
find
out
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
one
ever
asked
him
whether
he
changed
his
mind.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
right
there
was
he
ever
asked
to
submit
his
version?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
yes.
i'm
sorry.
i
see
you
have
reference
to
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
settlement
of
the
record,
he
was
never
asked,
as
i
understand
it,
to
submit
anything,
was
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
prior
to
the
settlement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
prior
to
the
questioning.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
he
asked
to
do
prior
to
the
settlement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
each
of
those
was
considered
was
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
well,
incidentally
i
think,
you
told
us
earlier,
there
was
a
transcript
taken
out
of
the
proceedings
in
those
three
days
in
view?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
bennett,
in
the
preparation
of
what
it
was
that
was
sent
to
him
for
comment.
in
addition
to
the
witnesses,
the
police
officers
who
were
consulted,
as
i
understand
it
by
mr.
fraser,
whom
else
did
mr.
fraser
consult?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
--
i
have
taken
that
he
did
not
consult
from
the
jurors,
did
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
he
consult
this
adviser?
i
understand
those
attorney
who
sat
with
mr.
chessman
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
that's
--
he
was
--
was
he
consulted
by
mr.
fraser
in
the
preparation
of
the
original
transcript?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
you
say
he
participated
at
the
settlement
proceeding.
would
that
be
the
one
in
june?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
was
not
there
in
june
when
--
i
gather
the
final
settlement
was
concluded?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
tell
me
mr.
bennett,
didn't
you
tell
us
earlier
that
if
he
had
not
wanted
an
appeal
taken,
nevertheless,
one
would
have
been
considered
under
your
automatic
procedure?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
that
circumstance,
would
the
supreme
court
have
appointed
counsel
for
him
to
argue
the
appeal
on
his
behalf?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
he
does
nothing.
he
decides,
“i
don't
want
to
be
heard.
i
want
no
appeal.”
yet,
as
i
understood
you
to
answer
a
question
earlier,
you
said,
nevertheless
an
appeal
would
be
taken
undetermined.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
who
would
argue
it
for
him
that
he
wanted
no
part
of
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no.
suppose
i'm
taking
the
situation
of
an
individual
sentenced
to
death
and
he
says,
"i
want
no
part
of
it.
i'm
willing
to
go
to
my
death."
nevertheless,
as
i
understood
you
to
say
earlier,
there
would
have
been
a
consideration
of
an
appeal.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
there
would
have
been
no
--
no
assignment
of
counsel
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
advocate
for
reversal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
have
there
been
situations
like
that
on
which
california
has
assigned
counsel
to
advocate
the
appeal
even
though
the
prisoner
doesn't
wanted
her
--
