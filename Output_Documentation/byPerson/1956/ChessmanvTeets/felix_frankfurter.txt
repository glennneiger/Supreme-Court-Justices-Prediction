justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
were
to
read
and
if
you
understand
it
accurately
the
exact
term
in
which
this
court
granted
certiorari,
there
wouldn't
be
need
of
all
these
discussions.
because
the
terms
of
certiorari
were
whether
there
was
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
that,
he
was
not
represented
in
person
or
by
counsel
designated
by
the
state
court
in
his
behalf.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
the
only
question
that
was
determined
by
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
i
call
attention
to
the
exact
terms
in
which
we
asked
audience
or
allowed
audience
because
that
brings
out
plainly
enough.
it
wasn't
his
presence
or
his
designation
or
his
selection
of
counsel
but
whether
implied
he'd
have
the
duty
on
the
part
of
the
court
to
designate
counsel.
that's
why
it
was
framed
that
way,
plainly
enough.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
make
that
explicit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
right
to
infer
from
that
that
under
your
procedure
in
california,
the
trial
proceedings
could
not
be
cast
in
narrative
form?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
in
--
in
murder
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
deal
is
automatic
and
that
has
to
go
to
the
supreme
court
of
california,
a
stenographic
account
of
what
took
place
in
the
trial
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
you
have
the
agreement
is
between
counsel
of
omitting
anything
or
putting
it
classic,
in
narrative
form?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
he
stands
and
said,
i
want
every
word
of
what
took
place
from
the
time
the
jury
who
examined
on
the
(inaudible)
is
entitled
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
i'm
asking
if
that
ought
to
be
susceptive
of
all
the
--
of
a
---
a
categorical
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
may
we
assume,
mr.
davis,
that
in
everything
you
will
say
regarding
the
circumstances
of
the
kind
of
record
that
were
adopted
in
the
supreme
court,
whatever
you
will
be
laying
before
the
court
will
be
derived
from
the
record
before
judge
goodman
in
the
district
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
such
other
documents
regarding
the
case
of
which
the
court
may
take
judicial
notice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
and
when
you
--
on
some
these
things
that
they
become
essential
not
to
paraphrase
what
was
said
in
judge
goodman's
thought,
the
thought
was
actually
in
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
--
was
the
consent
of
judge
fricke
required
for
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
was
he
sentenced,
mr.
davis?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
on
a
sentencing
day?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
would
you
be
enough
to
answer
and
declare
what
i
refer
to
be
the
implications
of
justice
brennan's
question?
will
you
state
in
detail,
how,
what
knowledge
and
how
the
knowledge
of
--
he
knew
that
the
official
reporter
or
the
court
reporter
was
dead.
how
--
what
knowledge
and
how
that
knowledge
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
chessman,
namely,
the
selection
of
fraser,
the
--
the
recommendation
of
fraser
to
judge
fricke,
judge
fraser
--
judge
fricke's
action
thereon
and
the
subsequent
events
relating
to
the
final
deposit
of
the
free-derived
record
before
the
supreme
court.
i
take
it
that
was
behind
that
question.
and
i
think
that
he
claimed
the
report.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
last
year?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
by
grapevine
or
by
court
notice?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
was
that
a
spontaneous
letter
from
the
reporter's
association?
what
do
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
apparently,
i'm
--
i'm
trying
to
stay
close
to
the
records.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
record
show
whether
this
case
sua
sponte
of
their
report
or
were
they
invited
to
make
some
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
chessman
take
the
stand
at
the
main
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
how
much
was
he
up
on
the
stand,
how
long?
do
you
happen
to
know?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
in
the
examination
and
cross
examination?
with
what's
on
the
record,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
can
you
tell
whether
--
what
was
the
day
with
the
original
reporter?
justice
felix
frankfurter
perry.
did
perry
transcribe
the
--
the
examination
and
cross
examination
of
chessman
himself?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
of
the
portion
that
perry
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that's
--
that
was
not
disputed.
that
that
was
transliterated
by
the
--
transcribed
by
the
courtroom,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
any
other
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
not
what
i
meant.
i
didn't
make
myself
clear.
this
is
perry,
the
stenographer
who
took
down
the
examination
and
cross
examination
of
chessman,
did
he
transcribe?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
fraser
has
done
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
did
--
did
chessman
have
a
chance
to
go
over
his
testimony
to
see
where
the
phrase
is
correctly
transcribed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
correction
as
to
his
own
testimony?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
i'm
talking
about
his
testimony
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
not
the
rest
of
that.
i
know
all
about
that.
but
i
do
not
know
whether
chessman
found,
claimed
they
were
inaccurate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
transferred
to
--
as
of
his
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
as
to
his
cross
examination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
he
claimed
imperfections
in
the
transcriptions
by
the
posthumous
and
before
the
stenographer
as
to
his
own
testimony,
is
that
correct?
he
claimed
that
there
were
imperfections
in
what
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
the
words
they
put
into
his
mouth
or
what
they
omitted,
what
took
place
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
version
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
he
have
what
the
defense
witnesses
apart
chessman?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
(inaudible)
once
with
the
defense
appointed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
after
they
claimed
the
imperfection,
did
any
of
those
relate
to
the
defense
witnesses
other
than
chessman?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
i'm
going
beyond
him.
i'm
going
as
to
other
witnesses.
you
stated
that
the
--
the
district
attorney
and
the
new
fraser
personally
examined
witnesses
for
the
prosecution
in
order
with
the
view
to
checking
up
or
completing
it
over
there
as
they
examined
witnesses
to
the
prosecution
to
perfect
transcriptions
of
perry's
notes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
go
to
any
of
the
defendant's
witnesses?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
foreclose
you
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
a
minute
ago
that
those
facts
had
not
appeared
and
not
become
a
matter
and
not
and
put
into
evidence
on
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
record
would
bear
you
out
on
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
and
you
--
you
can't
be
certain
as
i
gather
from
your
answer
that
you
ask
him
that
after
the
private
consultation
of
witnesses
for
the
prosecution
to
find
out
of
so
many
years
later
or
whatever
(inaudible)
to
find
out
their
recollection
of
what
they
testified
with
the
trial.
you
are
unqualified
in
taking
on
the
use
of
the
court
that
that
fact
had
not
become
a
matter
of
knowledge,
proof
or
knowledge
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
recall
you
really
(inaudible)
was
that
of
a
fair
construction
by
judge
goodman
of
our
--
the
terms
of
our
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr
davis
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
asking
you
and
most
about
--
i
hope
he
recovers,
the
attorney
general
had
come
to
these
terms.
you
said
there
were
two
witnesses,
two
prosecution
witness
who
were
privately
consulted
by
fraser,
the
--
the
substitute
and
later
(inaudible)
in
company
with
the
district
attorney
in
order
to
--
as
a
result
of
such
private
entity
to
enable
fraser
to
put
down
what
it
is
they
testified
here
in
court.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i
would
like
to
ask
you
and
what
i
hope
the
attorney
general
could
(inaudible)
were
these
from
your
point
of
view
if
you
were
to
take
from
this
court,
were
these
two
witnesses
not
merely
a
witness
for
the
prosecution
but
they
--
have
they
--
were
they
significant
witnesses?
were
they
important
witnesses
to
the
issues
at
the
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
alleged
the
confession
that
the
questioning
issue
came
how
soon
after
he
was
arrested?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
davis,
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
affidavit
preceded
the
determination
of
the
denial
of
the
prohibition
by
the
supreme
court
of
california?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
in
–
in
the
proceedings
which
led
to
the
denial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
has
to
involved
now.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
before
judge
goodman?
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
if
you
--
if
in
fact
--
if
in
fact,
the
record
that's
finally
considered
by
--
by
mr.
fraser
and
judge
fricke,
if
in
fact
the
accuracy
of
that
record,
that
transcription
is
from
the
very
notes
are
incontestably
accurate,
i'm
making
that
assumption.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
wouldn't
be
here
presenting
it
as
a
denial
of
due
process
(inaudible)
instead
of
in
los
angeles,
would
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
assuming
that
the
record
was
--
was
unassailably
accurate
as
fraser
reconstructed
it.
assuming
it
was
fully,
absolutely
accurate,
you
can't
complain
of
the
accuracy
of
the
transcription
from
the
--
from
perry's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
hieroglyphics.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
wouldn't
be
here,
would
you
merely
because
the
district
attorney
(inaudible)
to
be
delivered
to
chessman
in
court
instead
of
having
delivered
that
as
before
in
prison.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
that's
on
the
assumption
that
the
record
is
not
a
true
transcript
of
what
took
place.
that
it
couldn't
be
truthfully
or
accurately
be
constructed.
but
when
i
say
you
wouldn't
be
here,
i
don't
think
we'd
listen
long
to
you
to
contest
that
under
california
law,
it
must
be
made
up
one
way
rather
than
another
provided
there
wasn't
what
you
claimed
to
be
an
inherent
defect.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
claiming
an
inherent
defect,
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
defect.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
the
position
i'm
trying
to
barely
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
didn't
have
the
facts
which
you
now
say
is
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
there
minutes
made
of
the
conversation
between
the
district
attorney
and
mr.
fraser
and
these
prosecution
witnesses?
are
there
memoranda
of
what
they
said?
where
--
where
did
he
visit,
their
houses?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
--
where
was
--
where
was
the
locale?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
it
wasn't
in
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
there
were
these
--
that
were
these
interviews
or
an
interview
between
leavy
and
fraser
and
two
officers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is
was
there
minutes
made?
was
any
memorandum
either
--
of
either
a
stenographer
impression
or
were
some
minutes
made
--
lawyers
make
minutes
of
interviews
with
people.
was
any
minutes
made
which
is
now
on
the
record
of
what
these
officers
told
for
instance
to
enable
and
then
to
put
in
the
record
of
their
testimony
months,
previously?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
want
to
ask
you
one
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
you
just
said
the
rough
notes
were
destroyed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
are
the
rough
to
your
phrase
--
the
rough
notes
cover
the
same
material
as
what
does
referred
with
the
--
before
he
says,
the
raw
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
phrase
have
made
something
that
recall
a
raw
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
call
off
with
--
on
the
basis
of
which
is
the
record
--
which
the
court
had
between
all
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
underlying
data
are
not
inexistence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
enter
a
caveat.
i
--
i
don't
think
it's
axiomatic
that
if
a
trial
had
--
has
been
passed
and
something
beyond
anybody's
control
what
the
lawyers
called
an
act
of
conflict
effects,
in
another
time
it's
precluded.
i
just
stating
so
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
did
california
said
so
and
then
i'm
bound
by
it
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wouldn't
treat
it
as
axiomatic,
for
me
it
has
no
difference
and
that
if
the
(inaudible)
he
couldn't
go
on,
he
could
have
another
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
perhaps,
it
hasn't
settled?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
can't
be
settled
for
me
until
you
pass,
i
want
to
say
why
it
could.
it's
accidentally
hasn't
necessarily
interested
by
that
when
it
can't
be
settled
until
there
is
a
trial
and
on
the
conviction
itself
to
be
double
jeopardy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
--
i
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
started
that
it
was
–-
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
accident
of
nature
because
i
don't
believe
it
could
be
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
suggesting
that
it
couldn't
be
held
as
adjudication
because
that
was
not
the
issue
to
that
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
well,
i'm
just
wondering
not
to
have
that
from
your
own
challenge
as
both
been
acting
a
natural
law
that
you
care
for
a
new
trial
if
you
can't
possibly
have
an
appeal
when
the
law
allows
you
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
take
your
word
for
the
jurisdiction,
that's
enough
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
did
he
tried?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
i
just
would
want
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
take
it
inseparable
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
nobody
attended
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this,
mr.
bennett.
suppose
it
has
to
be
possible
to
make
up
this
question,
suppose
nobody,
suppose
fraser
and
everybody
else
as
i
can
apparently
carries
hieroglyphics,
what
would
have
happened?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wrote
an
opinion
saying
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)can
probably
note
just
in
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
it
couldn't
,
suppose
the
--
suppose
there
were
--
i
was
--
totally
the
other
day
by
a
colleague
of
mine
that
a
lot
of
federal
judges
have
never
heard
of
judges
notes
and
he
thinks
there.
suppose
there
were
no
--
have
to
know
judges
notes,
suppose
human
recollection
wasn't
equal
to
reconstructing
what
the
phrase
was
being
--
impeach
trial
or
--
or
a
month
tried,
what
then?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can't
imagine
--
i
can't
imagine
that
if
there's
no
way
of
bringing
to
the
supreme
court
of
california
a
reliable
record,
a
reliable
reconstruction
of
what
took
place
at
the
trial
in
lieu
of
stenographic
minutes
that
it
can't
be
done
that
your
court
will
hold
of
being
conceivable,
that
therefore,
there
can't
be
an
appeal
and
therefore
the
conviction
must
stand.
i
can't
imagine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
maybe
that
this
has
such
vises
that
it's
the
equivalent
of
an
absence
of
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i'm
not
bound
by
the
supreme
court
of
california
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
you
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
assure
you
my
mind
is
innocent
of
a
conclusion
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
were
here
and
mr.
davis
is
here,
this
court
brought
the
case
here
because
it
appeals
a
very
important
question
to
arise
in
connection
with
the
method
by
which
this
record
was
made
up
and
not
foreclose
by
what
the
california
report
said
by
way
of
dictum
and
not
to
foreclose
by
what
is
cited
on
a
different
record
than
we
now
have
before
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
argument
then
--
and
i'm
going
to
ask
you
questions
for
enlightenment
because
it
seems
to
be
drawn,
it
seems
to
be
relevant
to
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
that
you
say
that
commend
of
an
adult.
this
is
the
best
record
there
is
and
when
you've
got
all
the
record
you
can
at
the
end
of
the
matter,
then
it's
the
end
of
the
matter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well,
that's
why
i
asked
you
questions
in
order
to
indicate
the
difficulties
that
i
for
one
have
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
also
have
questions
to
mr.
davis
before
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
began
to
speak.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
dictated
it
to
the
lady?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
would
read
the
notes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
she
couldn't
read
the
hieroglyphics?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
think
any
ambiguous
remark
by
being
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
hieroglyphics,
that's
what
they
are.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
on
the
facts
that
appeals
in
criminal
cases
go
automatically
to
your
state
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
chessman
had
written
a
letter
for
the
registrar
or
the
clerk.
the
supreme
court
say,
"we
don't
talk
of
that
case
because
i
don't
want
to
hear."
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
would
--
what
would
be
the
results?
justice
felix
frankfurter
ignored.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
why
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
if
the
public
interest
which
transcend
the
expression
of
choice
by
the
convicted
capital
offense?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
would
you
mind
telling
me,
i
have
no
public
(inaudible)
with
the
refusal
to
let
him
appear
in
person.
that
does
not
exhaust
the
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
was
said
that
he
didn't
want
an
appeal,
you
disregard
it
because
of
the
public
interest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
public
interest
took
hands
though.
justice
felix
frankfurter
justification
for
sending
a
man
to
death.
and
why
there's
a
public
interest
to
see
that
the
record
on
the
basis
of
which
he
will
only
go
to
jail
has
been
appropriately
settled
in
the
way
which
the
lawyer
settled
that
by
an
adversary
proceeding.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
you've
heard
what
i've
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i,
personally,
do
not
think
the
due
process
requires
that
california
should
bring
him
into
court
after
trial
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
do
not
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
myself
without.
that
doesn't
exhaust
the
problem
as
i
understand
that,
namely,
that
there's
a
public
interest
to
be
represented
whether
chessman
chooses
or
not.
just
as
much
so,
that
there's
a
public
interest
that
your
supreme
court
could
hear
an
appeal
although
chessman
tried
him,
through
have
--
i
handle
that
he
doesn't
he
want
to
have
the
appeal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
can
--
he
can
to
the
extent
in
saying,
"i
want
my
attorney
to
be
there.”
and
of
course
then
the
state,
the
trust
upon
attorney
would
deal
but
he
has
no
right
to
foreclose
a
public
interest
to
be
so
great,
that
you
hear
an
appeal
although
he
protest
against
having
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
doesn't
in
here
take
what
you
call
the
--
the
court
suggested
it
for
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
bennett,
i've
been
through
a
point.
may
i
ask
you
to
comment
on
what
the
chief
justice's
judgment
is
there?
in
his
standing,
the
copy
i
have
is
--
you
happened
to
have
the
petition
with
the
appendix.
at
page
9
--
october
19th,
there
are
two
things
that
i'm
going
to
ask
you
about,
judge
denman
said,
no
one
in
question
that
chessman
would
have
been
entitled
for
a
reversal
if
he
had
been
able
to
maintain
his
contention.
but
the
judge
instructed
the
jury
that
if
they
found
that
he
has
committed
the
attorney
charge,
they
must
render
a
verdict
for
the
best
interest
although
such
is
going
on,
et
cetera.
and
secondly,
he
enforced
in
this
they
had
to
claim
the
two
record
and
show
those
with
prejudicial
statements
made
by
the
prosecutor
as
to
requirements
of
the
judging
judge.
the
last
shall
be
first
stating
that
in
the
trial
first,
is
it
--
is
it
on
facts.
mr.
davis
--
and
i
say
to
the
facts
why
do
we
change
it?
it
is
one
for
retention.
is
it
a
fact
that
one
them,
with
chessman's
objection
to
the
accuracy
of
the
record
was
that
they
were
omitting
and
that
was
reported
to
be
the
his
examination
or
cross-examination
interjected
in
a
lot
of
remarks
trying
to
prosecute.
is
that
a
fact?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
suggested
the
claims
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
claims
that
there
was
omission
of
remarks
by
the
district
attorney
during
the
course
of
his
--
being
on
the
witness
stand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
judge
denman
said
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
mean
not
--
not
what
they
are
but
is
there
a
great
claim
they
were
such?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
that
means
--
but
specifically
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
there
are
categories
with
their
class
of
omission
consisting
of
alleged
interjection
to
a
statement,
call
him
what
you
will
by
the
prosecutor
while
chessman
was
on
the
witness
stand
which
he
claims
were
omitted
from
the
previous
transcription
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
about
the
first
part
of
judge
denman's
remark
that
he
claims
that
the
judge
in
fact
instructed
the
jury
that
they
must
bring
in
capital
offense?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
according
to
your
law,
that
isn't
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
it
was
that
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
chessman
say
that
in
fact
he
did?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
he
hasn't
yet
said
it
that
(inaudible)
didn't
reach
the
inscription
of
the
deputy
in
charge.
it's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
perry,
i
mean.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
had
not
done
that?
so
that,
while
in
fact
counsel
who
tried
to
judge
him
charged
the
jury
writing
those
symbols
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
there
is
any
controversy
as
to
whether
those
symbols
did
or
didn't
implicate
that.
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
human
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
proof
that
it
would
and
would
be
a
reliable
transcription
of
those
symbols?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
his
challenge
is
simple
and
reliable
transcriber.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i
don't
know
why
you
say
that
because
judge
goodman,
i
think,
would
concede
justification
and
said,
i'm
not
to
pass
on
that
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
he
also
said
several
times
that
he
was
going
to.
and
he
was
going
to
miss
the
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
don't
take
your
time
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
am
i
not
also
entitled
with
all
the
conclusions
from
the
statement
of
a
judge,
include
that
i
have
reliable
statements
taking
and
thinking
judge
goodman
here
for
this
sense
of
relevance,
who,
unless
you
tell
me
the
quotations
are
inaccurate
except
the
things
that
are
set
forth
on
page
34
and
35.
the
judge
then
said
i
don't
care
if
you
it
move
it
up
to
the
hills.
it
wouldn't
affect
me.
how
--
how
dependable
are
these
by
me
if
they're
not
found.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
talking
about
the
cross
of
page
34
and
35
in
this
issue.
but
the
mere
accuracy
of
it,
it
could
be
--
it
could
be
75%
wrong
and
he
couldn't
raise
any
federal
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
advise
you
to
suggest.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
when
he
--
on
page
34,
i
don't
think
the
supreme
court
is
going
to
be
spending
4
days
leave
to
determine
the
accuracy
of
his
good
grounds.
whether
they
did
or
not,
i'm
not
going
to
do
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
kind
of
a
judicial
mind
have
you
for
the
determination
of
an
issue
if
the
judge
says,
i'm
not
going
to
be
concerned
with
that
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
other
considerations
if
--
if
we've
correctly
informed
that
what
are
for
the
transcribed
notes
of
the
final
--
the
final
notes
that
the
underlying
transcription
by
mr.
fraser's
not
available.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
answer
proves
it
and
--
as
a
matter
of
--
of
authority
of
a
document
as
what
is
colloquy,
if
i'm
presented
for
the
document
which
you
represent
a
lot
of
underlying
data
what
is
essential
is
that
the
underlying
data
in
order
to
find
out
what
is
the
final
form
of
the
transcription
represents
the
underlying
data
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
be
the
problem
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
might
be.
we
now
have,
what
mr.
fraser
said
is
the
transcription,
although,
he
first
did
some
raw
things,
some
rough
notes
we
could
destroy
--
but
i
don't
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
speaking
of
the
determination
of
the
weight
to
be
attached
to
your
argument
is
not
your
own
notes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
bennett,
do
you
happen
to
remember
whether
in
his
--
in
his
specification,
alleged
errors
and
inaccuracies
in
the
proposed
transcript,
did
he
make
any
complaint
about
the
charge
within
this
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
this
particularly.
did
he
make
any
complaint
with
regard
with
his
accuracy
as
transferred
to
the
trial?
i
can
--
we
can
hook
it
up
but
i
assume
we
got
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
remember
that
thing
in
place?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
what
happens
exactly
condition
of
this
fellow
to
prepare
for
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
authenticated?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
sort
of
a
public
defender
is
he
like?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
bennett,
would
you
be
good
enough
to
state
your
view
of
the
relation
to
the
enforcement,
the
importance
of
the
two
police
officers
who
were
privately
can
summon
by
fraser
and
the
district
attorney
in
order
to
be
able
to
put
on
the
paper
what
basis
of
transcription?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
is
--
was
the
officer
--
the
officer
on
--
whose
testimony
presented
the
introduction
of
(inaudible)
