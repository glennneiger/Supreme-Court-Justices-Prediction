mr.
william
m.
bennett
may
it
please
the
court.
because
we
are
concerned
with
the
question
of
counsel
here
and
a
very
long
and
a
very
voluminous
record,
we
must
look
at
the
totality
of
the
facts.
and
the
first
thing
i'd
like
to
discuss
is
the
method
by
which
the
record
was
prepared,
a
method
approved
incidentally
by
a
california
court
in
construing
a
california
statute
in
the
california
rules
upon
appeal.
now,
when
reporter
perry
died,
he
being
the
reporter
who
had
lived
during
that
trial
and
taken
all
the
notes,
the
california
court
was
confronted
with
a
most
unique
situation.
a
new
trial
was
impossible
for
the
reason
that
the
grounds
for
new
trial
in
california
are
purely
statutory
and
no
new
trial
was
permitted.
the
california
supreme
court
has
so
stated.
discharge
of
the
prisoner,
maybe
that
occurred
to
somebody,
but
that
was
impossible.
this
was
a
--
a
most
serious
charge
and
kidnapping
had
been
found
against
him
on
two
counts
and
a
death
penalty
had
been
imposed,
so
that
was
impossible.
now,
there
was
a
third
thing
that
might
have
been
done
and
that
rested
with
the
petitioner
himself,
mr.
chessman.
under
the
california
rules
upon
appeal,
he
had
the
right
under
rule
36
to
make
application
to
judge
fricke
to
prepare
a
settled
statement.
that
was
not
done.
there
was
no
way
then,
and
i
know
of
no
way
now
by
which
he
could
have
been
compelled
to
do
it.
so,
there
was
a
remedy
available
to
him
which
he
did
not
exercise.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
under
rule
36
of
the
rules
on
appeal,
your
honor.
if
for
any
reason,
the
stenographic
notes
are
not
capable
of
being
transcribed,
the
party
affected,
it
may
make
application
to
the
court
for
permission
to
prepare
a
settled
statement
of
that
which
occurred
at
the
trial,
meaning
the
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
that
applies
to
capital
cases
and
our
supreme
court
has
so
held
in
people
against
chessman
35
cal.2nd
at
455.
it's
so
stated
in
that
opinion
but
mr.
chessman
did
not
do
it.
now,
the
fourth
thing
and
the
only
thing
then
that
remained
to
be
done,
discharge
being
impossible,
know
new
trial,
he
not
electing
to
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well,
it's
a
very
interesting
point
but
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
--
it
has
been
decided.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes,
it
was
settled
by
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
it's
been
settled
in
35
california
second
by
the
californian
supreme
court.
they
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes.
i
--
i
won't
dwell
upon
it
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes,
all
right.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
that
--
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes.
there
were
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
very
well.
it
--
it
was
dicta.
i
admit
it
but
they
did
say
it.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
very
well.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
i'll
state
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
i'll
state
the
proposition
this
way,
the
california
supreme
court
in
construing
our
penal
code,
the
section
which
provides
for
new
trials
and
criminal
cases,
and
i'm
answering
justice
douglas,
said
that
under
the
chessman
case
where
the
reporter
died
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
--
no
due
trial
was
permitted.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
all
right.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes.
so
--
so
that
being
so
and
because
an
automatic
appeal
was
conferred
by
california
upon
chessman
in
the
death
penalty
case,
a
complete
appeal,
of
course,
would
require
a
record.
the
state
had
the
judgment
of
conviction,
death
penalty
in
two
instances.
but
the
interest
in
the
appeal
was
to
chessman's
benefit
to
have
a
record
before
that
court
so
that
any
errors
which
might
lead
to
a
reversal
might
be
exposed.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well,
your
honor,
i
can
refer
the
court
to
the
case
of
miller
against
united
states
which
was
referred
in
317
u.s.
and
i
don't
have
the
exact
page,
but
in
that
case,
the
reporter
for
the
court
was
also
the
secretary
to
the
judge
and
she
was
so
busy,
it's
stated
in
the
opinion
of
this
court,
that
she
could
not
transcribe
the
notes.
it
was
quite
lengthy.
now,
i
believe
it
was
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
application
was
made
to
have
the
government
transcribe
the
record
and
it
was
resisted
by
the
government
and
the
court
then
pointed
out
that
a
bill
of
exceptions
would
lie
and
that
in
preparing
it,
the
--
one
making
up
the
record
was
entitled
to
rely
upon
the
notes
of
the
judge,
consult
with
the
witnesses
and
go
to
any
other
source
from
which
veracity
could
be
established
leading
into
this
record.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
and
so
that's
what
could
have
been
done
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well,
i
suppose
then,
your
honors,
that
if
it
got
to
that
point,
it
would
someday
come
to
this
court
and
under
griffin
against
illinois,
you
might
say
that
it
would
not
be
equal
protection
to
take
his
life
because
no
record
was
there
for
review.
now,
i
can't
predict
what
the
court
would
say
in
a
case
like
that.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes.
that
is
not
this
case
and
--
and
i
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
i
think
we're
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
i
know
that
your
honor
but
let's
also
realize
this,
that
if
that
situation
were
to
obtain
under
rule
36
of
the
california
rules
on
appeal,
the
defendant
himself
could
apply
to
the
court
to
prepare
a
settled
statement.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
now
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes,
very
well.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes,
your
honor.
thank
you.
now,
i
was
talking
about
the
method
adopted
and
i
think
i
got
to
the
point
where
i
can
now
state
correctly
that
the
method
adopted
was
the
method
compelled
to
be
used.
because
the
benefits
of
the
appeal
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes.
and
i'll
be
happy
to
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
but,
your
honor
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
i've
only
been
talking
to
three
minutes
and
i
have
much
to
say
and
--
and
surely
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes.
and
my
position
has
not
in
the
least
wise
yet
been
fully
stated
either,
i
realized
these
difficulties.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
and
i
welcome
the
questions,
your
honor,
and
i
hope
i
can
answer.
but
in
any
event,
this
was
a
method
that
was
compelled
under
our
rules
on
appeal
as
construed
by
our
courts
and
our
state
court
has
held
that
this
method
adopted
under
california
law
was
a
fair
method.
now,
when
we
talks
in
term
for
so
--
fairness,
i
think
we're
talking
in
terms
of
due
process
at
least
at
this
beginning
stage
of
the
case.
and
so,
the
method
adopted,
the
method
compelled
was
a
method
that
has
been
held
to
be
valid
under
california
law,
california
law
which
conferred
the
appeal
in
the
first
instance.
now,
as
to
the
manner
in
which
the
trial
transcript
was
prepared,
that
--
that
just
wasn't
happenstance
that
mr.
fraser
was
employed.
he
wasn't
walking
down
the
street
and
he
wasn't
selected
out
of
a
crowd
to
do
this
job.
when
reporter
perry
died,
the
seriousness
of
the
problem
confronting
the
appellate
aspects
of
this
case
were
apparent
to
all,
the
judge
and
the
prosecuting
attorney
and
to
mr.
chessman,
himself,
who
asked
that
the
proceedings
be
dismissed.
and
so,
the
notes
were
given
to
other
reporters
in
the
los
angeles
county
court
house
building
and
a
reporter
by
the
name
of
gerni
(ph)
read
them
and
she
voiced
the
opinion
that
they
were
capable
of
being
transcribed.
she
would
not
undertake
the
test,
however,
because
she
had
daily
duties
to
attend
to
and
she
didn't
want
to
get
involved
in
this.
now,
mr.
fraser
was
selected,
first
of
all,
because
he
had
formerly
works
in
common
employment
with
mr.
perry,
the
dead
reporter.
he
had
even
lived
with
him
for
a
time.
they
had
talked
shop
the
way
lawyers
do
and
the
way
reporters
do
and
each
had
read
the
notes
of
the
other
each
was
a
pitmanic
reporter.
and
that's
why
mr.
fraser
was
selected
and
he
was
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
pitmanic,
your
honor.
that
--
that
style
of
shorthands
--
rule
of
shorthand.
and
that's
why
he
was
selected.
and
he
was
selected
upon
the
recommendation
in
the
first
instance
of
this
(inaudible)
gerni,
the
other
reporter
who
had
first
read,
the
dead
reporter,
perry's
notes
and
said
they
were
capable
of
transcription.
now,
before
reporter
fraser
began,
these
facts
must
be
taken
into
consideration.
before
he
died,
reporter
perry
had
dictated
on
to
a
recording
device,
the
first
646
pages
of
this
transcript.
the
first
646
pages
of
the
transcript
were
transcribed
as
they
always
had
been
in
the
past
by
his
long
time
transcriber
one
grace
peter
michael.
so
that
whether
reporter
,perry,
had
lived
or
whether
he
had
died,
the
first
646
pages
would
have
been
transcribed
in
the
same
manner
as
appears
in
the
record
before
this
court
and
as
was
reviewed
by
the
california
supreme
court.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
he
dictated
to
a
machine
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
--
and
she
listened
to
his
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
--
voice
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
apparently
not.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
no.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
i
know.
i
realized
that.
so
that
the
646
pages
are
important
because
they
show
that
if
--
if
nothing
else
existed
we
have
a
key
to
the
penmanship
and
the
style
and
a
pitmanic
system
of
the
dead
reporter.
and
it
incidentally,
within
the
first
646
pages,
is
found
the
testimony
of
the
two
kidnap
victims.
their
examination
and
their
cross-examination
by
the
defendant.
that's
in
the
first
646
pages
taken
from
the
voice,
if
you
please,
of
the
dead
reporter
perry.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
no,
it
does
not,
your
honor.
it
does
not.
now,
there's
another
thing
that
must
be
said
here
and
it's
this.
there
was
a
question
about
the
competency
of
fraser
by
mr.
chessman
in
his
long
continuing
series
of
attacks
upon
the
man's
character
and
ability.
but
this
court
specifically
directed
an
inquiry
into
the
question
of
fraud
and
collusion.
and
mr.
fraser
was
exposed
to
all
of
the
questions
and
all
of
the
examinations
of
mr.
davis.
and
he
was
attacked
as
to
ability
and
to
character.
and
all
that
i've
just
related
came
out.
to
begin
with,
mr.
perry's
style
of
penmanship
was
what
we
call
"copperplate".
those
are
the
words
of
a
man,
named
paul
berdict
(ph),
who
testified
as
an
expert
before
judge
goodman
and
who
said
that
his
notes
were
of
the
best
quality
and
quite
legible.
now,
mr.
fraser
testified
before
judge
goodman
as
to
his
prior
experience
with
perry
in
reading
his
notes,
how
they
had
been
life
long
friends,
how
they
had
worked
for
a
common
employer
in
seattle,
and
how
they
had
a
room
together.
and
after
all
of
that
was
done,
they
even
examined
the
method
by
which
mr.
fraser
prepared
these
particular
transcript
pages.
and
they
found,
true,
that
he
consulted
the
notes
of
judge
fricke.
well,
that
was
approved
in
the
miller
case
decided
by
this
court.
he
did
talk
to
some
of
the
witnesses.
that
apparently
is
approved
by
the
miller
case,
decided
by
this
court.
and
he
used
other
sources
of
material.
and
after
all
that
that
was
done,
the
court
found
that
the
record
was
prepared,
not
only
by
mr.
fraser
but
with
the
assistance
of
leavy
and
fricke
in
an
eminently
fair
manner
and
that
mr.
fraser
was
especially
confident
and
qualified
to
prepare
the
record.
now,
before
the
page
was
closed
on
a
preparation
of
the
record,
there
was
another
man
who
made
his
entry
into
the
preparation
of
it
and
that
was
mr.
chessman
himself.
mr.
chessman
was
furnished
a
complete
copy
of
the
reporter's
transcript,
he
being
at
san
quentin
state
prison.
and
he
read
it.
we
have
to
presume
he
read
it
because
here
was
a
man
who
knew
that
his
fate
is
continued,
right
to
live
would
depend
upon
whether
or
not
he
could
discover
some
material
errors
in
the
transcript
that
was
delivered
to
him
at
san
quentin
state
prison.
and
so,
he
read
it
and
he
forward
it
to
judge
fricke,
a
document,
legal
size,
double-spaced
comprising
approximately
28
pages,
and
there,
he
set
forth
all
of
his
objections
to
the
transcript
as
prepared
by
fraser.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
on
february
11th,
there
was
a
proceeding
in
judge
fricke's
court
and,
of
course,
the
courtrooms
are
always
open
to
the
public
and
it
was
reported
and
it
was
transcribed.
and
at
that
time,
the
first
portion
of
the
transcript
was
presented
to
the
court.
later
on
in
april,
there
was
another
proceeding
transcribed
again
at
which
it
was
adopted.
now,
at
the
first
proceeding
before
judge
fricke,
the
clerk
was
directed
to
send
the
transcript
to
caryl
chessman
at
san
quentin
state
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
no,
your
honor.
there
was
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes
there
wa,
your
honor.
as
to
whether
or
not,
he
was
informed
as
to
the
exact
date,
i
cannot
say.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
we
can
approach
that
this
way,
and
i'd
like
to
take
a
little
time
to
answer
that
question.
the
allegation
has
been
made
that
from
language
contained
in
an
affidavit
of
j.
miller
leavy,
the
prosecutor
at
the
trial
of
this
case,
stating
that
the
transcript
would
be
delivered
to
chessman
in
court,
that
from
that,
he
inferred
a
promise
that
he
would
be
present.
now,
that
affidavit
was
filed
with
the
california
supreme
court
in
order
to
gain
more
time
to
file
a
brief
or
the
transcript
to
complete
it
on
november
3rd,
1948.
on
april
3rd,
1949,
before
the
transcript
had
been
filed,
there
was
an
affidavit
filed
by
chessman
himself
for
the
california
supreme
court
in
which
he
sought
time,
further
time
to
read
the
transcript.
and
in
that
affidavit,
he
said
that
he
had
been
duped
by
judge
fricke
and
prosecutor
leavy
into
thinking
that
he
would
be
present
at
the
hearing
before
judge
fricke
to
settle
the
transcript.
now,
if
there
is
sought
to
be
established
any
state
action
from
that,
to
begin
with,
it
wasn't
a
promise
from
leavy
to
chessman
made
in
his
presence.
it
was
language
taken
from
an
affidavit.
secondly,
if
it
is
any
kind
of
a
promise,
there
has
to
be
some
reliance
upon
it.
now,
if
chessman
knew
on
april
3rd,
1949
that
he
would
not
be
present
in
court
and
he
must
have
known
it
because
he
said
in
the
affidavit
that
he
had
been
duped
into
thinking
he
would
be
present,
then,
it
was
his
duty,
if
time
were
remaining,
to
take
legal
steps
to
compel
his
presence
in
court
to
take
those
steps.
he
said
on
april
3rd,
1949,
he
had
been
duped.
the
transcript
was
settled
on
june
1st,
june
2nd,
and
june
3rd
of
1949
so
that
he
have
the
time
period
from
april
3rd,
1949
to
june
1st,
1949
within
which
to
make
application
to
some
california
court
to
order
his
person
produced
before
judge
fricke,
and
he
did
not
do
so.
he
applied
once
to
the
california
supreme
court
to
be
produced
and
they
denied
it
without
prejudice.
and
he,
by
this
time,
knew
full
well
but
without
prejudice
manner.
now,
further,
he
could
not,
for
a
moment,
have
entertained
the
notion
that
he
would
be
produced
or
that
the
transcript
would
be
delivered
to
him
in
judge
fricke's
court
for
the
reason
that
it
was
in
fact
delivered
to
him
at
san
quentin
state
prison.
that's
where
he
took
delivery.
so
as
to
that
fabricated
promise
and
as
to
this
notion
of
reliance,
the
facts
disclosed
that
it
just
is
not
so.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well,
now
normally,
your
honor,
and
my
experience
would
come
from
civil
cases
more
than
others,
each
side
would
be
represented
by
counsel,
each
would
share
the
statement
of
what
occurred
one
with
the
other.
of
course,
it
would
have
to
be
filed
with
the
court,
and
the
court
would
have
the
hearing
to
allow
or
disallow
that
which
was
set
forth
as
being
true
so
far
as
the
record
is
concerned.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
your
honor,
we'll
approach
it
this
way,
and
again,
we
have
to
go
back
to
the
days
before
the
trial
proper
commenced.
now,
at
that
time
following
arrest
and
arraignment,
chessman
was
represented
by
the
deputy
public
defender,
the
first
public
defender's
office
in
united
states
was
established
in
los
angeles,
by
the
way.
and
later
on,
before
the
trial
commenced,
48
days
before
the
trial
begin,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
took
place
in
the
courtroom.
the
court,
"are
you
a
good
lawyer?"
chessman,
"i
think
so."
the
court,
"few
lawyers
say
they
are
good."
the
defendant,
chessman,
"i
think
i
am
a
good
enough
lawyer."
the
court,
"you
don't
want
to
trust
it
to
a
lawyer?"
chessman,
"i
don't
want
to
do
it."
and
then
some
more,
and
it's
quite
clear
from
that,
that
he
insisted
upon
representing
himself.
and
then
again
he
said
this,
at
another
p
oint
in
the
transcript.
this
is
chessman
speaking,
"i
wish
to
point
out
that
it
is
my
intention
to
act
in
propria
persona
at
this
time
and
to
continue
to
do
so
until
such
time
as
it
is
legally
established
that
i
am
not
qualified
to
do
so
and
that
i
will
not
accept
a
court
appointed
attorney."
now,
that's
how
the
trial
began,
chessman
representing
himself.
and
if
there's
any
question,
whatsoever,
of
--
of
a
competent
rejection
of
counsel
or
if
you
want
to
put
in
terms
of
labor,
consider
this,
this
is
not
an
ignorance,
or
an
illiterate,
or
an
uninformed,
or
misguided,
or
coerced
individual.
on
the
contrary,
here's
a
man
of
intelligence
so
described
by
judge
goodman.
in
fact,
judge
--
judge
denman
said
that
his
briefs
would
do
credit
to
an
experienced
criminal
practitioner.
that's
the
man
who
pushed
away
the
aid
of
counsel
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial.
now,
when
he
did
that,
he
was
unnoticed
of
what
california
law
was.
and
california
law
guaranteed,
if
you
please,
his
presence
at
the
trial.
not
a
word
any
place
in
the
california
constitution
or
statutes
or
other
states
that
we
can
find
saying,
if
you
are
convicted
and
if
you
represent
yourself,
you
thereby
acquire
the
right
to
leave
the
prison
gates
to
make
an
appearance.
so
that
it
is
our
position
that
when
he
elected
to
defend
his
own
cause,
he
had
before
him
the
possibility
of
conviction
or
the
possibility
of
acquittal.
and
the
possibility
of
conviction
entailed
with
it
the
disability
of
being
unable
to
represent
himself
if
imprisoned
in
a
state
prison.
and
further
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
now,
we're
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
now,
we're
coming
to
the
case,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well,
and
again
i'd
like
to
answer
it
this
way.
in
price
against
johnston,
this
court
weighed
what
i
thought
was
the
obvious.
in
other
words,
the
public
safety
which
is
a
--
a
paramount
requirement
here
as
against
the
rights
or
i
prefer
to
call
them
privileges
of
the
individual.
in
the
johnston
case,
the
court
was
dealing
with
the
habeas
corpus
case
of
course
and
the
question
was
whether
the
prisoner
was
entitled
to
make
an
oral
argument
upon
appeal.
and
this
court
said
that
in
that
case,
it
was
discretionary.
now,
of
course,
if
it's
discretionary,
it
cannot
be
a
matter
of
right.
and
if
that
is
the
rule
that
is
to
obtain
in
the
federal
courts,
and
the
courts
now
were
talking
about
the
sixth
amendment
release
the
trial
process,
certainly,
no
higher
rule
should
obtain
in
the
state
courts
where
we
are
not
operating
under
the
sixth
amendment
although
california
does
furnished
counsel
in
these
cases.
no
doubt
about
it.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
is
it
a
fact,
your
honor.
the
penal
code
provides
that
in
death
penalty
cases
and
appeal
is
automatically
taken.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well,
as
a
matter
fact,
your
honor,
chessman
did
exactly
that
but
in
another
way.
in
his
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
it
would
be
ignored.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
because
we
have
basic
concepts
of
what
is
fair
and
what
is
right,
i
believe.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
can
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
i
can't
quote
the
exact
words.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
but
he
did
say
in
the
reporter's
transcript
to
those
proceedings.
and
now,
we
find
the
situation
of
this
that
the
defendant
having
rejected
the
aid
of
counsel,
he
finds
himself
in
a
situation
where
--
where
it
is
either
possibly
or
something
like
that,
possibly
should
be
represented
by
counsel
and
he
doesn't
have
one.
that's
what
judge
fricke
said.
but
of
course,
that
--
that
observation
is
not
conclusive
if
the
right
just
was
not
there.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well,
your
honor,
we
we're
in
a
--
as
i
see
it
and
--
and
are
now
in
a
very
peculiar
position
here,
here's
a
man
who
said,
"i
don't
want
a
court
appointed
attorney."
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
no,
your
honor.
affirmatively,
he
never
said
that
in
those
words.
but
we
don't
have
to
express
what
he
have
within
us
by
words
alone.
this
man
at
the
outset
of
his
trial
was
told
of
his
rights
to
counsel,
he
didn't
want
them.
now,
that
knowledge
was
with
him
when
he
was
at
san
quentin
prison
and
never,
at
any
time,
did
he
asked
the
supreme
court
or
any
other
court
to
appoint
an
attorney
to
represent
him.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
no
one
ever
asked
him
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
and
he,
being
the
intelligent
man
that
he
was,
he
never
asked
for
counsel
either
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
no,
your
honor.
the
record
doesn't
show
if
anyone
ever
asked
him.
now,
there's
also
this,
could
california
compel
an
attorney
upon
this
man?
this
court
has
said
that
if
a
man
wants
to
plead
guilty,
that's
his
right
to
do
so.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
that's
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well,
your
honor,
because
overwriting
all
of
these
discussion
now,
apparently
is
the
premise
that
chessman
wasn't
there
and
that
he
should
have
been
there,
but
let's
look
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes.
i've
heard
what
you
said.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
all
right.
now
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well,
but
your
honor,
if
we
would
trust
an
attorney
upon
a
man,
a
state
appointed
attorney,
if
you
please,
would
that
--
wouldn't
that
man
have
the
right
to
assert
his
right
not
to
have
such
an
attorney
represent
him.
he
--
whether
its
trial
or
appeal?
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well
now,
in
answer
to
justice
brennan's
question
and
to
show
the
consistency
of
the
position
of
chessman
so
far
as
rejecting
the
aid
of
counsel
is
concerned,
after
the
record
was
filed
and
it
was
forwarded
to
the
court,
the
competency
of
the
manner
of
preparation
was
reviewed
by
the
california
supreme
court,
and
in
that
proceeding,
chessman
wrote
a
brief.
and
in
his
opening
brief,
which
we
have
quoted
on
page
27
or
our
brief,
he
again
asserts
his
position
to
appear
personally.
that
has
always
been
his
position.
he
has
never,
until
loss
this
court
created
the
argument
for
him,
he
has
never
said,
"my
position
is,
i
should
be
there
or
an
attorney
should
represent
me."
his
position
has
always
been,
"only
i,
can
defend
my
cause.
only
i
should
be
present.
now,
of
course
we've
got
a
new
attack
in
the
case,
an
attorney
should
also
be
present,
but
that
has
never
been
his
position
up
to
now.
so
that
whether
or
not
anybody
asked
him
if
he
wanted
an
attorney,
really
there
was
no
need
for
it.
this
man
was
so
vociferous
about
what
he
wanted
that
nobody
had
any
doubt
that
he
would
not
accept
the
services
of
an
attorney.
and
of
course,
on
death
row,
these
things
aren't
sacred
in
california
or
in
any
other
state
prison.
he
knew
that
all
he
had
to
do
was
asked
the
supreme
court
to
have
an
attorney
appointed
and
that
would
be
done.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
he
did
not
do
it.
his
only
interest
was
in
prohibiting
the
proceeding
or
in
representing
himself.
now
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
no
he
doesn't,
your
honor.
his
position
hasn't
changed.
now,
so
far
as
--
again,
coming
back
to
his
right
to
be
present,
we
do
have
to
balance
the
public
safety
requirements
as
against
mr.
chessman's
privilege
or
desire.
here
was
a
man
convicted
of
two
very
serious
charges
which
entail
the
death
penalty.
the
distance
from
san
francisco
to
los
angeles
is
800
miles,
round
trip.
now,
supposing
the
man's
name
were
delinger
or
something
else
that
carries
a
lot
of
evil
connotations,
is
a
state
judge
within
his
sound
discretion
saying,
"open
the
gates,
exposed
him
to
the
public
for
800
miles."
now,
is
there
any
difference
because
his
name
happens
to
be
chessman?
you
know
what
the
record
chose
in
this
case.
we
think
that
the
california
court
had
the
right
not
to
let
him
out.
the
california
supreme
court
said
that
that
was
the
case
and
every
single
court
that
has
reviewed
this
question
without
exception
has
said
that
he
does
not
have
a
right
onto
the
due
process
requirements
or
under
equal
protection
or
under
any
other
theory
to
be
present.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
quite
obvious.
he
is
now
been
a
judge,
the
menace
to
society.
now,
getting
back
to
what
occurred
before
judge
fricke,
if
the
transcript
had
been
prepared,
if
it
had
not
been
given
to
chessman,
if
he
had
not
have
the
time
and
opportunity
to
read
it,
and
if
he
not
submitted
a
long
list
of
written
objections
which
were
then
filed
before
this
court,
that
would
be
a
far
different
case.
the
record
would
have
been
settled
without
his
voice
being
heard,
but
his
voice
was
heard
and
here's
the
interesting
about
all
of
his
objections.
we
say,
well
he
didn't
put
a
certain
objection
in
--
in
the
courtroom
adverse
of
that,
and
a
way
to
believe
that
knowing
that
his
life
was
at
stake
in
this
proceeding,
if
an
objection
didn't
occur
to
him
or
if
for
some
reason,
he
was
playing
a
cat
and
mouse
game
with
his
own
life
that
--
that
is
something
we
cannot
control.
but
every
single
objection
that
he
put
into
his
list
of
omissions
and
inaccuracies
was
allowed
or
disallowed
by
judge
fricke
and
then
most
minutely
reviewed
by
the
california
court
and
they
said,
allowing
everyone
of
his
objections,
it
would
not
have
affected
the
result
upon
appeal.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
it's
a
document,
your
honor,
which
is
contained
in
the
supplemental
first
transcript
and
chessman's
document
is
entitled
motion
to
correct
and
augment
record,
perhaps,
this
is
reporter's
transcript.
and
then,
the
document,
legal
size,
entitles
defendant,
appellants,
list
of
inaccuracies
and
omissions
in
the
record,
reporter's
transcript.
and
judge
fricke,
by
the
way,
at
the
time
of
adopting
or
settling
the
record
said,
as
the
trier
of
fact
that
there
were
facts
here
that
he
had
given
due
consideration
to
all
of
chessman's
objections.
now
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
your
honor,
you
mean,
is
it
a
fact
that
they
were
omitted?
mr.
william
m.
bennett
--
or
settled?
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
judge
denman
says
so
but
--
and
chessman
does
claim
omissions
but
he
does
not
pinpoint
them,
if
so
that
if
he
doesn't
pinpoint
them,
i
can't
really
say
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes.
he
claims
--
well,
it's
--
it's
called
here
list
of
omissions-inaccuracies,
yes.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
specifically,
he
points
to
nothing.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well,
your
honor,
to
be
honest
about
it,
i
don't
know.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
i
have
already
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well,
the
judge
may
not
give
such
instruction
under
california
law.
second
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well,
yes.
i
--
i
can
answer
that
most
fully,
your
honor,
in
this
way.
it
was
never
said
until
1954,
and
then
in
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
for
the
first
time,
the
claim
was
made
that
judge
fricke
had
told
the
jury
they
must
return
the
death
penalty.
that
was
the
allegation.
we
denied
it.
and
subsequently,
that
was
sent
to
judge
goodman
along
with
the
fraud
and
collusion.
and
judge
goodman
had
in
his
courtroom
judge
fricke,
two
lady
jurors,
who
sat
in
the
original
trial,
cecile
oskin
(ph),
the
county
clerk,
who
sat
throughout
the
entire
trial,
leavy,
the
prosecutor,
who
was
there
throughout
the
entire
trial.
everyone
of
those
witnesses,
without
exception
said,
"no
such
instruction
was
given."
now,
on
the
other
side
of
the
table,
there
was
not
produced
a
single
witness
who
said
that
he
or
she
had
heard
such
language.
and
so,
that
language
of
judge
denman's,
while
it
appears
is
--
is
grossly
inaccurate.
the
proof
of
that
allegation
in
chessman's
petition
has
never
come
forward
nor
frankly
will
it
because
it
wasn't
said.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
reporter
perry?
mr.
william
m.
bennett
no,
your
honor,
he
had
not
done
that.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
no,
your
honor.
there
is
--
well,
yes.
there
is
a
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
a
stated
controversy,
certainly.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
that's
correct
sir.
but
again,
talking
about
the
symbols,
the
man
who
transcribed
them,
adjudged
to
be
competent
by
a
federal
court.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
oh,
but
your
honor,
he
--
he
did
pass
upon
that
issue.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well,
your
honor,
now
let's
--
let's
talk
about
that
a
moment.
i
don't
think
this
has
too
much
to
do
with
the
case
but
it
must
be
said.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
there
was
actually
an
offer
made
from
judge
goodman
to
mr.
chessman
to
have
fraser's
ability
tested
on
the
stand
to
the
extent
of
the
reporter
going
into
chambers
and
transcribing
and
the
offer
was
refused
by
mr.
davis.
you
can
draw
your
own
conclusions.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well,
but
your
honor,
if
--
if
we're
talking
now
by
judge
goodman's
language,
he
said
no
question
that
chessman
would
have
been
entitled
to
reversal
if
it's
--
it's
preceded
by
an
"if".
he
doesn't
say
this
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
--
occurred.
he
says,
"if
it
occurred."
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well,
the
reason
judge
goodman
was
doing
that,
of
course,
was
because
he
was
--
he
was
limited.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes.
but
your
honor
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
but,
your
honor,
the
fact
to
the
matter
is,
as
one
of
the
other
justices
said,
that
there
was
almost
no
limit
upon
what
mr.
chessman
could
prove
in
that
proceeding
before
judge
goodman,
if
he
could.
and
we
talked
about
the
notes
being
accurate
and
what
judge
goodman
permitted.
let's
look
at
it
this
way,
the
charges
made
that
judge
fricke
said,
"bring
in
the
death
penalty."
now,
to
demonstrate
that
he
didn't
say
it,
proof
was
taken
in
the
court.
now,
the
notes,
as
transcribed,
don't
contain
it.
and
on
top
of
that,
we
have
five
or
six
witnesses
in
judge
goodman's
court
who
say,
“they
didn't
hear
it.”
so,
isn't
there
some
basis
for
concluding,
well,
if
the
notes
don't
say
it
and
if
the
witnesses
say
they
didn't
hear
it
and
if
mr.
chessman
produced
nobody
who
says
he
did
hear
it,
that
therefore
possibly,
the
notes
might
just
be
right.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well,
but
your
honor,
isn't
the
answer
to
that
is
this
that
if
there's
--
we
could
talk
about
this
forever
but
there
has
to
be
a
time
in
a
judicial
proceeding
when
proof
has
to
start
marching
forward.
and
if
the
contention
is
made
that
this
was
so
and
if
they
didn't
produce
a
single
witness
to
establish
it,
we
could
talk
about
it
endlessly
but
the
fact
to
the
matter
is,
the
state
has
proved
that
it
did
not
occur
in
a
federal
court.
we
presented
the
witnesses.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well,
the
underlying
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
the
underlying
data,
if
the
court
please,
are
the
legible
shorthand
symbols
of
deceased
reporter,
perry.
i
think
that's
the
beginning
answer
of
that.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
reason
there
were
notes
is
because
i've
got
notes
here
for
an
argument,
i
have
notes
for
a
brief
and
i
just
don't
say
them
after
i'm
finished
in
those
part.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
all
i
can
say
again
is
that,
well,
i'd
like
to
go
into
another
point
if
the
court
please.
now,
so
far
as
the
due
process
is
concerned,
we're
dealing
here
with
--
with
an
appeal
and
this
court
have
said
that
the
state
need
not
confer
an
appeal
but
just
so
it's
conferred
equally
to
all
--
the
requirements
of
the
federal
constitution
are
met.
now,
i
cited
the
case
of
avery
against
alabama
in
the
brief
in
the
--
that
presents
an
instance
where
a
man
who
was
arrested,
arraigned,
tried,
and
convicted
within
a
period
of
four
days.he
was
represented
by
a
court
appointed
counsel.
they
had
asked
for
additional
time
to
make
a
better
defense
and
upon
conviction,
that
became
the
basis
for
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
and
this
court
said
in
the
avery
case
that
because
on
the
motion
for
a
new
trial,
there
was
no
showing
made
that
a
different
or
better
defense
would
have
occurred,
therefore,
there
was
not
like
a
due
process.
now,
let's
relate
the
philosophy
of
that
case
to
the
present
situation.
the
california
supreme
court
had
said
that
even
allowing
all
of
the
inaccuracies
and
omissions
of
chessman,
the
result
upon
appeal
would
not
have
been
affected.
judge
goodman
reviewed
the
somewhat
startling
claims
of
fraud,
collusion,
conspiracy,
improper
use
of
notes,
improper
consultation
with
witnesses,
and
he
found
a
reporter
eminently
qualified,
he
found
no
such
mandatory
death
penalty,
instruction
had
been
given,
and
in
short,
that
the
best
possible
record
was
prepared.
and
in
fact,
there
was
no
showing
ever
made
that
the
record
that's
prepared
wasn't
in
fact
a
better
record
than
would
have
been
prepared
by
the
dead
reporter,
perry.
so,
that
we
have
here,
in
addition
of
those
things,
the
voice
of
chessman
himself
at
the
settlement
hearing
in
the
document
which
i
just
picked
up,
all
of
his
list
of
objections
and
things
that
should
be
disallowed.
now,
never
at
anytime
throughout
the
nine
or
ten-year
course
of
this
case
has
he
been
able
to
do
anymore
than
say,
“i
have
the
right
to
be
present
but
don't
call
upon
me
to
prove
what
different
result
would
obtained,
and
i
have
made
allegations
in
the
past
which
have
been
upon
scrutiny
by
the
courts
destroyed.
but
i
still
assert
that
i
have
the
bare
right
to
have
the
entire
proceeding
reversed,
why,
because
i
was
not
there
even
though
i
can't
show
a
different
result."
now,
we
don't
think
that's
the
law.
the
california
supreme
court
in
reviewing
his
record
and
his
list
of
omissions
said
that
they
were
looking
to
the
record
on
appeal
to
determine
any
substantial
errors
which
would
call
--
cause
a
reversal.
now,
this
court
in
the
due
process
cases,
particularly
dealing
with
counsel
reverses
only
when
there
is
some
error
has
been
made
out.
and
if
there
hasn't
been
error
made
out
to
the
prejudice
of
the
defendant,
the
result
is
usually
affirmed.
now,
we're
dealing
here
with
a
process
which
admittedly
is
unique
but
it's
created
by
a
state.
and
we
concede,
perhaps,
it
isn't
ideal
although
there's
no
showing
made
that
it
isn't
perfectly
suited
to
the
role
that
you'd
fill
on
appeal,
and
perhaps,
it
doesn't
need
every
conceivable
hardship.
but
recall
now
that
this
remedy
was
taken
by
california
or
this
procedure
because
among
other
reasons,
chessman
himself
elected
not
to
furnish
to
the
trial
court
his
version
of
what
went
on.and
so,
we
were
compelled
to
do
it.
now
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
if
the
--
now,
if
the
court
please,
under
rule
36
of
the
rules
on
appeal
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
oh
yes,
your
honor.
he
was.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes,
your
honor.
prior
to
settlement.
that's
what
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well,
let's
make
that
clear.
the
transcript
was
filed
in
the
court
on
april
11th,
1949.
it
was
immediately
mailed
to
chessman
at
san
quentin
state
prison.
at
san
quentin
state
prison,
he
had
the
period
of
time
from
april
3rd,
1949
to
june
1st,
1949
within
which
to
read
the
record
with
a
critical
eye,
which
he
did.
he
asked
for
one
extension
of
time
and
in
the
affidavit
seeking
the
extension,
he
said
to
the
california
supreme
court
that
he
was
quote
"exhaustively
studying
the
record
for
error."
and
then
on
the
settlement
dates
on
june
1st,
2nd,
and
3rd
los
angeles,
this
document
i
have
in
my
hand
was
there,
mailed
there
by
chessman
from
san
quentin
and
this
document
contains
a
list
of
every
error
he
claimed
occurred,
every
omission
that
was
there
and
all
the
rest
of
it.
and
so
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
that's
on
file
before
this
court
in
one
of
the
many
boxes
down
the
basement,
your
honor.
so
that
chessman
was
there.
his
views
were
presented.
now,
again
getting
back
to
this
due
process
and
the
--
the
bare
of
assertion
of
the
right
without
a
showing
of
any
prejudice,
what
may
we
ask
more
could
he
do
with
reference
to
this
transcript
then
point
out
those
things
he
thought
which
were
in
error
well
that's
what
he
did
in
this
document
and
he
had
to
do
it
in
writing
before
the
judge
could
consider
it.
now,
the
proceeding
before
judge
fricke
was
not
a
trial
into
the
--
the
guilt
or
the
innocence
of
chessman.
it
wasn't
that
at
all.
it's
true
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
to
my
knowledge,
that
was
all,
your
honor.
he
used
judge
fricke's
notes.
he
used
reporter
perry's
notes.
he
talked
to
these
two
police
officers
and
their
testimony
where
the
most
part
is
in
the
first
646
pages.
and
i
don't
know
of
anybody
else
with
whom
he
consulted
although
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
no
--
no,
your
honor.
he
did
not.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
al
matthews
sat
throughout
the
trial,
his
legal
adviser
and
al
matthews
was
at
the
settlement
proceedings,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
and
--
in
one
of
those
proceedings,
an
affidavit
from
al
matthews
was
offered
in
something
that
occurred.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
no,
i
--
i
don't
believe
he
was,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
that
was
an
earlier
one,
i
think,
in
february
11th
of
1949.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
no,
he
was
not
there
in
--
in
june.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
no,
your
honor.
that
--
that
was
a
freshly
concocted
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well,
i
--
i
have
to
search
for
it,
your
honor,
to
find
out.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes,
your
honor.
this
is
your
copy
i'm
using.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
it's
the
only
one,
i
believe,
you
have.
i
have
one
in
my
files.
now
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes.
i
certainly
will,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
i've
realized
that.
now,
again,
returning
to
this
idea
of
prejudice,
i
think
it's
correct
to
state
that
aside
from
the
claim
that
he
should
have
been
present,
it's
not
the
claim
that
he
should
have
an
attorney
there
because
he
did
not
want
one
and
he
hasn't
even
seize
that
idea
yet,
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well,
he
is
called
a
legal
adviser.
it's
a
term
new
to
me
until
i
get
into
this
case.
but
apparently,
he
--
he
did
consult
with
chessman.
he
did
advising.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well,
he
didn't
cast
him
out.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
he
is
part
of
public
defender's
office
and
he
was
there.
he
at
--
was
incidentally
who
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
some
--
somewhat
like
that.
but
he
was
to
advise
chessman
incidentally
to
do
nothing
about
appearing
a
record
on
appeal
but
rather
to
oppose
it.
now,
there
is
another
thing
that
must
be
set
here,
of
course,
if
the
court
please,
and
--
and
that
is
the
interminable
litigation.
the
meaning
of
brown
against
allen
to
all
of
these
claims,
stale
or
newly
can
try
and
it's
our
position
that
because
this
matter
was
never
raised
in
the
state
court,
it's
not
properly
before
this
court.
now,
i
realized
we're
here,
however.
but
i
--
i
do
say
that
if
the
court
is
to
be
true
to
what
is
the
apparent
meaning
of
repetitious
and
stale
claims
and
habeas
corpus
actions
that
they
should
mark
some
finality
to
these
proceedings
because
if
--
it
does
not
become
final
ultimately.
i
suppose
we
could
be
here
next
year
and
the
year
thereafter
because
he
thinks
of
a
new
idea.
now,
i
say
this
most
sincerely
to
the
court.
if
this
were
the
kind
of
a
case
were
we
had
a
method
not
approved
just
to
fairness
by
a
court,
a
manner
not
approved
just
to
fairness
by
a
federal
court,
a
transcript
not
given
to
him
or
he
didn't
have
time
to
write
down
all
of
his
objections,
if
these
were
a
trial
process
at
which
his
present
was
necessary
and
vital,
then
we'd
have
a
far
different
case.
but
this
is
strictly
an
appellate
proceeding.
the
federal
courts
have
--
have
so
held
it,
and
they
pointed
out
the
--
the
duty
of
a
state
with
reference
to
an
appeal
and
it's
not
a
griffin
against
illinois
situation.
on
the
contrary,
unlike
illinois,
we
paid
an
exorbitant
rate
to
have
a
transcript
prepared
for
this
man,
why?
so
that
somebody
could
find
an
error
and
reverse
his
conviction
if
possible.
that's
what
california
did
for
this
man.
the
invalidity
of
the
many,
many
attacks
upon
it
must
be
apparent
by
now
because
not
once,
not
once
and
fortunately
we've
got
a
trial
before
judge
goodman
has
a
single
one
been
sustained.
now,
the
state
of
california
feels
that
we've
done
everything
compelled
by
law.
we
don't
feel
that
we've
violated
any
due
process
requirements.
we
don't
feel
that
we're
at
liberty
dealing
with
the
people
of
our
state
to
cast
out
upon
them,
even
under
lock
and
key
and
under
guard,
a
man
so
dangerous
as
this.
for
example,
we've
got
a
man
in
california
who
recently
killed
13
people
and
is
quite
proud
of
it.
now,
is
any
judge
when
to
take
upon
himself,
the
risk
or
the
presumption
to
release
that
man
into
society
for
an
appellant
proceeding?
as
i
said
before,
this
court
doesn't
compel
the
federal
courts
to
do
it
in
oral
argument
but
why
should
a
higher
rule
be
placed
upon
a
state?
and
so
far
as
the
cases
in
due
process
talk
about
state
procedures
that
are
setup
that
aren't
perfect
and
all
that
sort
of
thing,
i
would
like
to
know
what
--
what
answer
can
be
furnished
by
way
of
remedy
to
the
situation
when
the
reporter
dies
under
a
california
rules
other
than
that
which
we
did.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
if
his
brief
did
not
spell
out.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well,
your
honor,
that's
not
uncommon
in
california
where
an
automatic
appeal
was
taken
or
any
other
kind
of
an
appeal
after
conviction,
imprisonment
and
the
brief
is
improper
and
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
the
court
research
clerks
would
have
done
the
briefing
on
it
as
well
as
the
justices,
the
thing
would
have
been
reviewed
and
affirmed
or
set
aside.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
no
assignment
of
counsel
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
no
--
no
assignment
of
counsel
unless
requested.
unless,
of
course,
the
case
were
of
some
unique
or
great
magnitude,
something
like
that
but
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
no.
i
--
i
can't
--
i
--
i
don't
of
any,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
it
has
been
done.
i
think
we
recognized
the
rule,
the
--
the
right
of
a
man
to
represent
himself.
now,
there's
another
thing
about
that
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
nobody,
your
honor,
just
himself.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
he
did
not
appear.
the
practice
in
the
california
court
is
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes.
but
there
was
no
oral
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
no
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
oh
no,
he
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
he
filed
a
brief,
your
honor.
at
the
oral
argument,
there
was
no
oral
argument
that
the
california
attorney
general's
office
does
not
argue
cases
when
the
imprisoned
defendant
is
not
there
to
argue
his
own
cause
nor
does
the
court
--
i
don't
know
whether
it's
mandatory
but
the
court
does
not
entertain
it
either.
both
sides
must
be
present
so
that
on
that
proceeding,
there
was
no
disadvantage
there.
he
didn't
argue
nor
did
we.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well,
your
honor,
one
of
those
officers
was
in
a
squad
car
and
he
ultimately
apprehended
chessman
after
a
chase
about
the
streets
of
los
angeles.
the
other
was
a
chemist
then
he
testified
concerning
certain
hairs
found
in
one
of
the
cars
involved
in
the
crime
scene.
i
suppose
all
the
testimony
and
trials
are
important
but
i
wouldn't
classify
this
is
the
most
important
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
we
attempted
to
find
it
at
the
noon
recess
and
we
couldn't
find
such,
your
honor.
and
i
--
i'd
like
to
say
this
along
those
lines.
the
two
counts
were
really
concerned
with
your
--
our
counts
711,
the
death
penalty
counts.
regina
johnson
testified
within
the
first
646
pages.
she
was
examined
on
direct.
she
was
cross-examined
by
mr.
chessman.
mary
meza,
the
other
kidnapped
victim
and
subjected
to
the
sexual
acts
of
degradation,
she
testified
within
the
first
646
pages
prepared
by
--
from
perry's
dictation.
she
was
cross-examined
by
chessman.
now,
that's
the
important
testimony
in
this
case
so
far
as
the
death
penalty
counts
are
concerned.
and
if
we
retain
but
those
two,
it
doesn't
matter
as
to
the
rest.
and
the
balance
of
the
testimony
following
the
646
page
is
necessarily
devoted
to
most
of
the
other
counts.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
i've
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
i
obtained
mr.
chessman's
brief
in
the
california
supreme
court
and
he
does
make
the
statement
in
there
--
in
there
that
the
testimony
of
mary
meza
and
regina
johnson,
one
or
both,
is
correct.
now,
to
be
fair
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
to
be
fair
about
it,
what
he's
saying
is
this.
it's
correctly
transcribed
but
i'm
not
the
man
they're
talking
about
but
as
to
the
credence
of
the
transcription,
that,
he
agrees
to.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
some
of
it
was,
your
honor,
and
some
of
it
was
in
the
balance.
we
could
furnish
that
to
the
court.
if
--
if
the
court
wishes,
i
can
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
no,
i
don't
know.
well,
i
will
submit
the
case
and
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well,
thank
your
honor.
there
is
one
thing
i
--
i
would
like
to
say
about
the
counsel
cases.
sometimes
it's
hard
to
grasp
a
rule
from
the
counsel
cases
coming
from
this
court,
but
when
they
do
read
due
process
into
those
cases,
they
find
prejudicial
error.
that's
my
language,
as
i
understand
the
cases
in
those
situations.
i
haven't
yet
found
a
case
in
which
this
court
has
reversed
on
notions
of
due
process
where
no
different
other
or
better
result
would
obtain
and
that's
this
case.
now,
i
can
only
emphasize
to
the
court
again
the
state
determinations
of
the
contentions
here,
the
prior
federal
determinations
and
if
california
had
any
notion
that
what
we
did
was
less
than
completely
fair
here
or
if
we
have
any
notion
as
to
guilt,
we'd
be
the
first
to
say
so.
but
we
consider
that
under
the
standards
of
this
court
as
to
state
procedures
that
there
can
be
no
valid
criticism
of
that
which
we
did.
let's
again
go
back
to
the
idea
that
mr.
chessman
had
a
--
a
right,
an
avenue
which
was
open
to
him
and
he
didn't
take
it.
and
so
we
prepared
the
record
for
his
appeal.
now,
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well,
your
honor,
at
what
point
that
came
out
to
me
frankly
becomes
somewhat
immaterial
except
as
we're
concern
about
brown
against
allen
in
the
application
to
have
the
right
to
raise
question
from
the
state
court.
but
to
the
merits
of
those
contentions,
the
relationship
that
has
been
fully
going
into
before
judge
goodman
and
this
court
can
decide
that
argument
on
the
merits
upon
his
findings
of
fact
that
the
relationship
did
not
taint
any
of
the
trial
transcript.
the
allegation
made
for
the
first
time
in
1954
that
judge
fricke
said,
“you
must
bring
in
the
death
penalty.”
i
cannot
conceive
that
the
closure
--
