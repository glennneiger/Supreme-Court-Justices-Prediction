mr.
george
t.
davis
yes,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court,
colleagues
from
california,
my
associate.
i'm
representing,
petitioner,
caryl
chessman
in
this
matter
together
with
ms.
rosalie
asher.
this
is
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
and
we
are
here
today
on
a
hearing
having
been
granted.
the
petition
was
directed
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
who
had
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
district
court
in
california,
denying
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
which
had
been
filed
by
caryl
chessman.
the
question
as
framed
by
this
court
in
effect
is
whether
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
failure
of
the
trial
court
in
los
angeles
at
the
time
of
the
original
trial
and
thereafter,
whether
the
failure
at
the
time
of
the
settlement
of
the
trial
record
by
that
court
to
allow
mr.
chessman
or
counsel
for
mr.
chessman
to
be
present
at
settlement
proceedings
was
of
such
a
nature
as
to
denying
him
due
process
of
law
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
mr.
george
t.
davis
at
that
time,
i
think
the
petition
raised
that
question
but
this
court
at
that
time
sent
the
case
back,
i
believe.
mr.
george
t.
davis
denied
certiorari.
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
george
t.
davis
not
that
single
question.
there
were
several
questions
presented
and
i
think
the
question
of
fraud
was
the
fraudulent
connivance
by
the
judge
and
by
the
district
attorney
and
by
the
court
reporter
in
presenting
a
spurious
and
false
record
were
used
on
appeal.
mr.
george
t.
davis
well,
that
may
be.
i
was
not
his
counsel
at
that
time
and
it
could
be.
mr.
george
t.
davis
it
could
be.
mr.
george
t.
davis
that
was
the
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
--
that
was
the
matter
before
the
court
at
that
time.
mr.
george
t.
davis
yes,
your
honor.
that's
our
contention
and
we
will
go
on.
mr.
george
t.
davis
as
a
fact,
he
did
not
have
counsel
at
those
proceedings.
mr.
george
t.
davis
he
was
not
offered
an
opportunity
to
have
counsel.
his
repeated
request
that
he'd
be
represented
or
that
he'd
be
present
at
said
proceedings
were
ignored
or
denied.
mr.
george
t.
davis
at
the
trial
itself.
at
the
original
trial
at
los
angeles,
he
waived
counsel.
mr.
george
t.
davis
he
conducted
his
own
defense.
but
he
did
not
waive
counsel
subsequently
in
the
light
of
the
unusual
and
unprecedented
circumstance
that
took
place
with
the
death
of
the
court
reporter.
mr.
george
t.
davis
he
did
not
ask
that
counsel
be
appointed.
he
asked
that
he
be
allowed
to
represent
himself
and
he
acted
in
making
such
request
on
representations
which
had
been
conveyed
to
him
at
the
prison
at
san
quentin,
representations
of
both
the
judge
and
the
district
attorney
that
he
would
be
allowed
to
be
present
in
court
at
the
settlement
proceedings.
it
was
not
until
the
proceedings
were
terminated
that
he
discovered
that
he
was
not
allowed
to
be
present
for
himself.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
george
t.
davis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
t.
davis
he
--
no.
he
did
not
specifically
request
counsel.
he
filed
an
affidavit
or
filed
a
motion,
rather,
with
the
trial
court
asking
that
he'd
be
allowed
to
be
present
so
that
he
could
participate
in
the
discussions
and
contribute
his
memory
of
what
had
happened
to
the
memories
of
all
the
others
who
were
being
asked
for
their
memories.
mr.
george
t.
davis
that's
right.
that
question
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
now,
may
i
just
discuss
what
i
deem
are
the
pertinent
circumstances
that
relate
to
that
particular
question
as
to
--
as
phrased
by
the
judge
and
as,
of
course,
presented
by
the
court.
this
man
was
arrested
and
tried
in
1948
just
about
exactly
nine
years
ago.
on
may
the
21st
of
1948,
the
jury
rendered
its
verdict.
there
were
two
death
sentences
among
the
others.
he
was
charged,
he
was
tried
on
--
before
the
jury
on
18
counts
of
various
and
miscellaneous
crimes,
not
the
same
but
at
different
times
and
different
places,
all
18
before
the
same
jury.
acquitted
on
one,
convicted
on
17,
sentenced
to
death
on
two.
he
was
sentenced
to
death
for
the
kidnap-robbery,
under
the
kidnap-robbery
statute.
he
did
not
kill
anyone
in
connection
with
these
offenses.
there
was
a
bodily
harm
aspect
to
one
of
the
statutes
which
if
the
jury
found
there
was
bodily
harm
in
the
kidnap-robbery,
allowed
them
to
sentence
to
death.
i
might
say
parenthetically
that
statute
was
amended
in
1951
and
is
no
longer
the
same
as
it
was
at
that
time.
now,
the
verdict
of
the
jury
came
in
on
may
the
21st
of
1948.
subsequently,
on
june,
notices
of
motions
for
appeal
and
so
forth
were
filed.
but
on
june
the
23rd
of
1948,
the
court
reporter
who
had
reported
the
trial
died
of
a
heart
attack.
it
was
discovered
almost
immediately
that
he
had
not
completely
transcribed
the
notes
of
the
trial.
that
approximately
two
thirds
of
the
notes
of
the
trial
had
not
been
dictated
by
the
reporter
and
remained
in
his
original
notes.
a
--
a
motion
was
made
by
the
defendant
who
was
still
representing
himself
in
propria
persona
for
a
new
trial
under
a
civil
statute
which
--
which
applied
to
this
type
of
case
and
provided
that
the
court
would
have
the
power
where
the
--
a
court
reporter
died
to
grant
a
new
trial.
there
was
no
such
statute
in
existence
in
california
nor
is
there
today
applicable
to
the
case
wherein
a
criminal
proceeding,
the
court
reporter
should
die
before
the
notes
are
transcribed.
under
california
law,
just
to
pass
it
because
it's
one
--
another
of
the
circumstances,
the
appeal
is
mandatory.
it
is
not
a
matter
of
right
in
the
sense
that
we
sometimes
think
of
it,
but
it
is
mandatory
in
death
sentence
cases.
and
the
appeal,
the
mandatory
appeal
is
required
to
be
taken
on
all
the
entire
record
of
the
proceedings
in
the
court
below.
according
to
the
rules
of
the
judicial
council
in
california,
there
are
several
methods
of
perfecting
a
record.
one
method
of
perfecting
the
record
and
the
method
which
was
adopted
in
this
case
was
a
method
which
could
not
be
adopted
as
it
is
stated
in
the
rule
because
of
the
death
of
the
court
reporter.
because
the
rule
provides
that
under
that
method,
the
court
reporter
shall
transcribe
the
entire
record
and
the
court
reporter
shall
certify
to
the
accuracy
of
the
record
and
shall
file
it.
of
course
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
t.
davis
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
there
is
a
proceeding
which
is
the
choice
of
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
george
t.
davis
certified,
too,
by
the
reporter,
under
the
rules
of
the
judicial
council.
mr.
george
t.
davis
there
is
a
statute
36,
section
36
of
the
rules
of
the
judicial
council
allows
the
--
the
convicted
person
to
choose
a
form
of
settlement
similar
to
that
which
you
are
speaking
about.
but
this
is
entirely
a
choice
of
the
appellant
under
the
rule.
mr.
george
t.
davis
that
is
our
position,
your
honor.
and
that
is
the
law.
mr.
george
t.
davis
it
is.
and
that
is
the
law.
now,
in
this
connection,
the
judge
practically,
immediately
recognized
that
the
circumstances
that
had
developed
by
reason
of
the
death
of
the
reporter
created
the
situation
where
it
was
--
under
which
it
was
impossible
under
california
law
to
perfect
the
appeal
in
accordance
with
the
rules
of
the
judicial
council.
and
at
the
--
at
a
hearing
on
the
25th
of
june,
two
days
after
the
death
of
the
court
reporter,
judge
fricke,
the
trial
judge
said
in
effect
that
an
appeal
would
be
perfected
within
the
limits
or
to
the
best
extent
of
human
ingenuity.
he
indicated
that
he
saw
no
reason
at
that
time
why
the
report
couldn't
be
transcribed
and
then
stated
in
so
many
words
that
he
would
order
an
appeal
to
be
perfected,
an
appeal
record
to
be
perfected
to
the
extent
of
human
ingenuity,
and
recognized
in
so
many
words
in
that
order
that
an
appeal
could
not
be
perfected
in
accordance
with
the
mandatory
requirements
of
california
law.
mr.
george
t.
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
t.
davis
you
may
assume
that.
i
will
not
deviate
one
iota
that
from
that
record.
mr.
george
t.
davis
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
prepared
to
do
that,
i
think.
now,
to
pass
over
this
space
a
bit,
the
next
thing
that
happened
was
that
some
steps
were
taken.
i'm
speaking,
now,
of
those
things
which
took
place
before
the
hearings
in
judge
goodman's
court
and
which
are
a
matter
of
record
before
this
court.
the
judge
then
called
the
attention
of
the
district
--
the
assistant
district
attorney,
mr.
leavy
to
the
situation
since
they
were
both
in
open
court
and
instructed
mr.
leavy
to
take
some
steps,
to
see
whether
the
record
could
be
put
together
within
the
limits
of
human
ingenuity.
this
was
in
june
of
1948.
some
proceedings
were
then
begun
by
mr.
leavy
to
obtain
a
contract
or
to
obtain
permission
to
employ
a
court
reporter
who
could
--
who
would
be
able
to
transcribe
mr.
perry,
the
deceased
reporter's
notes.
the
proceedings
to
employ
a
reporter
are
--
are
pretty
well
set
forth
in
the
hearings
before
the
district
court
or
the
--
that
is
the
circumstances
of
what
happened.
however,
i
wish
to
call
your
honor's
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
september
of
1948,
a
mr.
persons
(ph)
who
was
the
head
of
the
court
reporter's
association
in
los
angeles
county
wrote
a
letter
which
appears
in
this
record
and
which
was
forwarded
to
the
court
and
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court
and
the
district
attorney
that
court
reporters
in
los
angeles
country
had
attempted
to
decipher
the
deceased
reporter's
notes.
and
that
in
his
opinion,
those
notes
were
undecipherable
and
that
as
a
result,
the
making
of
a
contract
for
some
third
party
reporter
to
decipher
these
notes
was
not
a
very
proper
thing
to
do
because
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
reporter's
association,
it
was
not
a
practical
or
feasible
thing
from
the
point
of
view
of
actually
deciphering
the
notes.
now,
that
letter
which
was
sent
by
mr.
persons
(ph)
is
in
the
files
and
the
records
of
these
proceedings
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court
who
stated
in
the
district
court
that
he
had
familiarity
with
that
letter.
now
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
t.
davis
i'm
speaking
or
that.
that
was
sent
to
the
superior
court.
subsequently,
this
is
now
--
we're
up
now
to
--
to
september
of
1948.
subsequently,
mr.
leavy
obtained
the
services
of
a
mr.
fraser,
a
stanley
fraser,
who
was
a
court
reporter.
mr.
leavy
obtained
the
contract
from
the
city
of
--
from
los
angeles;
to
employ
mr.
stanley
fraser
at
what
has
been
estimated
at
three
or
more
times
what
would
be
paid
to
an
ordinary
court
reporter
doing
this
particular
kind
of
work.
mr.
leavy
instructed
or
apparently
instructed
mr.
fraser
to
go
ahead
and
gave
him
the
notebooks.
and
he
was
instructed
to
proceed
with
the
transcription
of
these
notes.
now
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
and
it
was
obtained.
but
judge
fricke
was
never
told
that
mr.
leavy
was
a
--
mr.
fraser
was
a
relative
by
marriage
of
district
attorney
leavy.
judge
fricke
testified
in
the
district
court
proceedings
that
he
did
not
know
that
there
was
any
relationship
between
these
two
people
and
that
it
had
never
been
brought
to
his
attention
either
by
mr.
leavy
or
by
mr.
fraser.
now,
the
two
gentlemen
proceeded
to
go
to
work
on
the
notes
by
a
--
a
method
which
mr.
fraser
testified,
was
one
that
he
had
never
used
before,
and
by
a
method
which,
by
merely
the
stating
of
it,
must
undoubtedly
appear
as
one
of
the
most
unique
methods
imaginable
for
the
preparation
of
a
record
of
this
type.
mr.
leavy
told
mr.
fraser
to
prepare
a
rough
draft
of
everything
that
he
was
going
to
transcribe.
so
that
mr.
leavy
and
mr.
fraser
could
look
over
the
rough
draft
and
to
quote
mr.
fraser
in
the
district
court
hearings
so
that
he
could
get
mr.
leavy's
cooperation
or
corroboration,
and
so
that
he
could
have
the
benefit
of
mr.
leavy's
memory
in
connection
with
the
preparation
of
the
final
draft.
mr.
fraser
testified
in
the
district
court
proceedings
that
this
kind
of
conduct
went
on
between
himself
and
mr.
leavy.
that
they
also
obtained
a
--
a
--
some
notes
from
judge
fricke
which
were
turned
over
to
them
so
that
they
might
also
use
these
notes
in
order
to
refresh
their
respective
memories
and
in
order
to
perfect
in
the
final
analysis
what
they
submitted
as
a
trial
transcript.
mr.
george
t.
davis
we
certainly
do,
your
honor.
we
had
claimed
it
was
unfair
i
would
--
i'm
going
to
discuss
that.
now
one
of
the
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
sir?
mr.
george
t.
davis
well,
chessman
had
been
informed
indirectly.
now,
he
--
he
was
removed
to
san
quentin
prison
in
july
of
1948.
now,
he
had
been
informed
in
the
prison
that
there
was
some
procedure
going
to
be
used
by
which
what
they
called
a
--
a
raw
transcript
was
going
to
be
prepared
before
a
final
transcript
was
prepared
and
he
sent
a
note
or
a
letter.
i
believe
it's
in
the
form
of
a
sworn
statement
to
the
--
to
the
superior
court
asking
in
connection
with
such
raw
transcript
as
--
as
he
put
it
asking
that
he
be
furnished
a
copy
of
that
raw
transcript.
we
have
--
i
have
here
and
it's
in
the
files
of
this
case,
it
was
filed
september
13th,
1948
in
the
superior
court
of
the
state
of
california.
it's
a
handwritten,
hand-printed
document.
it's
an
affidavit
in
support
of
a
request
for
prompt
delivery
of
the
trial
record
and
meet,
therefore,
and
it's
by
mr.
caryl
chessman
who
says
in
effect,
i
--
i
won't
read
it
all,
that
he
wants
the
--
the
reporter's
transcript
delivered
to
him.
and
he
wants
a
copy
of
the
trial
record.
he
gives
his
mailing
address.
he
says
he
wishes
the
reporter's
transcript
be
delivered
properly
after
completion
by
the
reporter.
so
that
if
necessary,
he
can
make,
edit
corrections.
mr.
george
t.
davis
oh,
he
knew
the
reporter
was
dead,
sir.
he
was
in
court
on
the
25th
of
june,
two
days
after
the
death
of
the
reporter
at
which
time
he
made
a
motion
to
vacate
the
judgment
on
the
grounds
that
in
view
of
the
death
of
the
reporter,
it
would
be
impossible
to
perfect
an
appeal
under
the
california
law
applicable
to
mandatory
appeals.
mr.
george
t.
davis
he
was
sentenced
on
the
25th
of
june.
mr.
george
t.
davis
this
was
on
--
at
--
at
that
very
same
time.
mr.
george
t.
davis
i
--
i
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
all
right,
sir.
i'll
try
to
do
that.
the
--
the
situation
was
this.
of
course,
mr.
chessman
was
in
court
on
the
25th
of
june,
two
days
after
the
death
of
perry
and
was
present
at
the
--
that's
the
first
reporter
and
was
present
at
the
time
that
judge
fricke
made
the
statements
in
open
court
that
a
transcript
would
have
to
be
put
together
to
the
--
within
the
limits
of
human
ingenuity.
mr.
chessman,
at
that
time
and
continuously
thereafter,
called
the
attention
of
the
court
by
affidavit
and
by
motion
and
by
various
documents
of
the
fact
that
first,
he
protested
that
such
a
record
could
not
be
put
together
within
california
law.
under
the
law,
he
denied
that
such
a
record
was
a
--a
permissible
record,
under
california
law.
mr.
george
t.
davis
he
didn't
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
most
of
what
he
knew
about
that,
he
didn't
actually
know
about
until
the
district
court
proceedings
in
san
francisco
when
these
things
were
brought
out
on
the
cross
examination
of
these
particular
witnesses.
mr.
george
t.
davis
last
year.
for
instance,
judge,
if
i
may
answer
you
very
specifically.
mr.
chessman
didn't
know
until
last
year
that
in
the
course
of
preparing
the
record,
that
mr.
leavy
and
mr.
fraser
not
--
went
to
the
homes
and
the
offices
of
two
police
officers
who
testified
in
the
original
trial
and
consulted
with
the
police
officers
about
their
testimony
in
the
trial
which
was
vital
testimony,
which
had
to
do
with
an
alleged
confession
by
mr.
chessman.
mr.
george
t.
davis
he
learned
of
fraser's
appointment
at
or
about
the
time
that
fraser
was
appointed.
mr.
george
t.
davis
that
was
back
in
1948.
mr.
george
t.
davis
this
was
by
grapevine.
he
was
not
notified
about
this.
then
of
course,
he
was
aware
of
fraser's
appointment
from
time
to
time
as
proceedings
went
on
because
mr.
fraser
and
mr.
leavy
filed
successive
applications
for
extensions
of
time
within
which
to
file
this
report.
it
--
it
took
them
something
like
18
months
before
they
were
able
to
file
a
transcript.
mr.
george
t.
davis
the
applications
for
extensions
of
time,
he
was
furnished
copies
of
those
applications.
mr.
george
t.
davis
well,
if
i
said
that,
i
didn't
mean
it
in
that
way.
he
received
these
applications.
it
was
not
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
well,
i'm
--
i
will
say
this.
that
i
am
sure
that
he
learned
of
fraser's
appointment
sometime
in
1948.
and
i
will
certainly
concede
that
it
was
brought
to
his
attention
in
some
official
manner.
mr.
george
t.
davis
this
letter
was
written
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
no.
this
document
that
we're
referring
to
here
is
dated
september
the
13th,
1948.
and
i
have
called
your
attention
for
the
fact
that
there
was
a
letter
written
in
the
same
month
by
the
head
of
the
court
reporter's
association
but
not
written
to
chessman.
that
was
written
to
the
court.
that's
not
harry
(inaudible)
letter
stating
the
notes
were
undecipherable.
mr.
george
t.
davis
well,
apparently
yes.
it
apparently
was
because
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
yes.
mr.
george
t.
davis
this
came
of
their
own
accord.
mr.
george
t.
davis
at
the
main
trial,
yes,
he
did.
mr.
george
t.
davis
i
don't'
know
the
exact
number
of
days
that
he
was
on
the
stand.
mr.
george
t.
davis
yes,
that's
right.
and
i
would
say
that
he
was
extensively
examined.
mr.
george
t.
davis
perry?
mr.
george
t.
davis
yes,
he
did.
mr.
george
t.
davis
yes,
that
is
right.
and
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
t.
davis
it
was
transcribed
by
him.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
t.
davis
excuse
me,
judge.
so,
let
me
be
sure
i'm
correct
saying
the
same
thing.
it
was
transcribed
subsequently
by
mr.
fraser.
mr.
george
t.
davis
yes.
no,
he
did
not
transcribe
it.
he
took
it
down
in
the
notebooks.
mr.
george
t.
davis
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
george
t.
davis
yes,
he
did.
mr.
george
t.
davis
he
had
a
chance
to
go
over
the
whole
testimony
and
sent
in
something
like
180
corrections
and
he
did.
in
answer
to
your
question,
he
did.
mr.
george
t.
davis
he
complains
and
contends
from
the
beginning.
mr.
george
t.
davis
yes.
mr.
george
t.
davis
he
did,
sir.
mr.
george
t.
davis
he
did,
sir.
mr.
george
t.
davis
he
did,
sir.
and
his
claim
was
that
the
prejudicial
remarks
of
the
district
attorney
which
were
also
combined
in
by
the
judge
all
during
that
period
of
his
testimony
were
omitted
completely
or
glossed
over
in
the
report
that
was
finally
submitted
by
fraser.
so
that
his
contention
that
he
had
been
prejudiced
by
snide
and
nasty
and
indirect
remarks
all
the
way
through
by
both
--
by
the
district
attorney
and
by
apparently
the
approval
of
the
judge
was
completely
missing.
mr.
george
t.
davis
no.
mr.
george
t.
davis
he
claims
there
were
imperfections
in
the
fraser
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
--
version
of
what
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
--
perry
allegedly
put
down
or
presumably
put
down.
mr.
george
t.
davis
yes,
there
were.
mr.
george
t.
davis
i
don't
remember
the
number.
mr.
george
t.
davis
there
were.
mr.
george
t.
davis
i
can't
say
that.
i
can't
say
yes
or
no
as
to
that
specifically
because
this
situation
reached
the
point
were
chessman
in
san
quentin
prison,
now
a
year
and
a
year
and
a
half
after
the
trial
was
incapable,
we
claim
and
contend,
was
incapable
sitting
up
there
of
recalling
everything
that
had
taken
place
with
reference
to
everybody
in
exact
detail.
he
was
doing
the
best
he
could.
mr.
george
t.
davis
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
george
t.
davis
they
did
not.
mr.
george
t.
davis
sir?
mr.
george
t.
davis
at
the
--
in
the
district
court
proceeding?
well,
your
honor,
when
we
got
to
that
subject
in
the
district
court
proceeding
before
judge
goodman,
we
were
told
practically
from
the
beginning
that
there
was
only
one
issue
that
judge
goodman
cared
to
hear
about
and
that
was
the
issue
of
fraudulent
connivance.
mr.
george
t.
davis
that
is
--
that
is
correct.
that
was
the
nature
of
the
order
that
came
down.
now,
when
we
tried
to
get
into
the
question
of
the
inaccuracies,
even
to
the
extent
of
one
inaccuracy,
the
judge
shut
it
off
and
said
that
it
was
not
an
issue
before
him,
that
he
would
not
consider
the
matter,
would
not
allow
any
discussion
or
any
interrogation
on
it
and
then
took
the
position
that
he
didn't
think
the
supreme
court
had
ordered
him
to
do
it.
but
if
it
had,
he
wouldn't
do
it
anyhow
and
said
that
if
there
were
75%
inaccuracy
in
the
actual
record,
he
wouldn't
consider
it
a
matter
of
due
process.
now
our
position,
i
must
--
i'd
like
to
say
this
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
well,
this
was
in
the
--
you're
--
you're
--
that
this
matter
has
been
up
before
the
courts
many
times
in
many
forms.
but
our
position
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
that's
right
and
that
of
course
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
we
do
not
think
it
does.
mr.
george
t.
davis
you
can
to
a
certain
extent
because
at
that
time
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
george
t.
davis
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
t.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
george
t.
davis
that
is
right,
sir.
and
he
asked
that
he
be
brought
to
the
superior
court.
he
specifically
requested
that
he
be
brought
personally
to
court
so
that
he
might
contribute
his
thinking
and
his
memory
and
he
might
participate
in
the
page-by-page
discussion
of
the
transcript
because
he
allegedly
stated
that
he
could
not,
at
that
distance
and
at
that
time,
without
that
further
help
be
expected
to
remember
everything
that
had
happened
at
the
trial
as
to
which
he
complained
insofar
as
the
transcript
was
concerned.
mr.
george
t.
davis
it
did
not.
mr.
george
t.
davis
it's
definitely
not
and
not
the
interviewing
of
the
police
officers.
mr.
george
t.
davis
he
did
not.
mr.
george
t.
davis
that
is
right
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
let
me
just
limit
this.
chessman
knew
before
that
of
the
relationship
between
fraser
and
leavy.
he
had
heard
that
before
that
and
had
investigated
and
had
attempted
to
bring
that
matter
up.
but
he
did
not
know
about
the
going
out
of
mr.
fraser
to
see
these
police
officers
in
order
to
obtain
their
memory
of
what
their
testimony
was
before
he
transcribed
their
particular
portion
of
the
notes.
that
was
brought
up
in
the
district
court
hearing
for
the
first
time
and
it
was
known
to
chessman
then
for
the
first
time.
now
there's
another
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
judge
goodman
didn't
consider
that
that
was
within
the
issues
that
he
was
called
upon
to
decide.
and
of
course,
we
took
a
strong
position
otherwise
because
it
certainly
seemed
that
if
you're
going
to
prove
fraudulent
connivance,
you'd
have
to
prove
it
by
facts
and
by
circumstances,
and
that
this
certainly
was
the
most
aggravating
type
of
fact
and
circumstance
that
could
come
forward
in
a
hearing
but
he
did
not
consider
that
that
was
a
matter
within
his
purview.
and
therefore,
he
passed
it
over
and
as
the
appellate
court
said
in
the
court
of
appeals,
he
made
no
findings
whatsoever
on
one
of
the
subjects
here,
of
course,
which
is
the
subject
and
issue
before
this
court.
that
is
the
--
whether
or
not
chessman
was
denied
due
process
by
not
being
allowed
to
be
there.
but
on
this
matter,
the
judge
merely
--
i
would
say
this
respectfully.
the
judge
effectuate
--
effectively
hamstrung
counsel
insofar
as
extending
the
inquiry
on
this
subject
is
concerned
because
he
did
not
consider
that
it
was
within
the
issues.
mr.
george
t.
davis
yes.
mr.
george
t.
davis
well,
here
was
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
i
think
you
are,
your
honor.
and
i'd
like
to
state
to
your
honor
that
where
and
how
i
think
you're
wrong.
never
in
proceeding
in
the
trial
court
before
judge
fricke,
never
was
a
question
asked
of
fraser
or
attempt
made
by
anyone
to
determine
out
of
fraser's
mouth
whether
he
could
transcribe
or
decipher
these
notes.
now,
when
an
attempt
was
made
before
judge
goodman
to
find
out
from
mr.
fraser
if
he
could
read
even
one
page
of
these
notes,
if
he
could
read
even
one
line
of
these
notes,
decipher
perry's
notes,
fraser
began
by
stating
that
he
couldn't
and
then
when
the
inquiry
was
sought
to
be
prosecuted
to
the
extent
possibly
of
developing
and
demonstrating
to
the
judge
that
mr.
fraser
was
incapable
of
deciphering
these
notes,
it
was
shut
off.
and
the
judge
said
it
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
these
proceedings
or
the
issue
and
we
were
not
allowed
to
ask
that
question
which
would
go
into
that
subject.
now,
i
believe
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
that's
right,
he
did
say
that.
mr.
george
t.
davis
right.
mr.
george
t.
davis
well,
that
is
substantially
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
that's
correct
and
when
it
reached
that
point.
but
the
--
the
point
is
that
prior
to
coming
to
that
point,
mr.
fraser
was
asked
to
go
through
these
notes.
he
was
pointed
--
he
was
shown
in
these
notes
in
certain
of
the
books
in
these
notes
pencils,
interlineations
which
were
not
--
which
were
his
and
which
were
not
the
original
reporter's,
they're
penciled
short-hand
interlineations,
they're
interlarded
with
those
interlineations
as
one
can
see
from
looking
at
them
and
an
attempt
was
made
and
the
charge
was
made
that
mr.
fraser
was
incapable
of
transcribing
and
deciphering
certain
portions
of
these
notes.
now,
we
got
into
quite
a
hassle
with
the
judge.
it
--
it
developed
into
a
--
a
pretty
sharp
situation
and
then
it
reached
the
point
where
we
were
talking
about
whether
he
could
transcribe
two
or
three
lines
and
he
would
take
all
the
rest
of
the
--
he
had
to
take
them
home
with
him
and
spend
the
night
in
order
to
be
able
transcribe
those
lines.
and
that
is
the
point
where
we
came
to
the
situation
you
have
described.
now
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
t.
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
t.
davis
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
george
t.
davis
i'll
–
i'll
have
to
answer
it
this
way.
he
complained
that
the
meaning
behind
the
questions
and
the
answers
and
the
prejudice
that
crept
in
from
these
remarks
had
been
glossed
over
in
such
a
manner.
mr.
george
t.
davis
i
can't
say
--
i
can't
say
as
to
that
and
i
won't
answer.
mr.
george
t.
davis
i'd
rather
not
answer
to
that.
i
know
that
his
basic
complaint
was
as
i
have
indicated.
and
that
it
had
been
glossed
over
and
smoothed
over
in
such
a
way
as
to
take
all
the
barbs
and
all
the
stings
out
of
the
things
that
had
taken
place
in
between.
mr.
george
t.
davis
he
had
heard
that
they
were
related.
mr.
george
t.
davis
i
don't
think
he
did,
sir.
i
think
that
is
a
subject
that
came
to
his
attention
subsequently.
mr.
george
t.
davis
the
record
shows
and
i
believe
that
we
have
--
we
have
perhaps
covered
that
in
our
brief
but
i'm
sure
that
the
record
will
show
where
he
first
learned
of
that
relationship.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
--
i'm
sure
that
it
was
afterwards
because
i
recall
that
he
hired
an
investigator
at
some
later
time
to
make
inquiries
about
that
subject
and
also
to
make
inquiries
about
the
alleged
inebriation
of
mr.
fraser
and
that
came
sometime
after
the
california
supreme
court
hearings.
mr.
george
t.
davis
i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
george
t.
davis
i
state
that
unqualifiedly.
i'm
positive
on
that.
mr.
george
t.
davis
no
state
court
has
passed
on
it.
mr.
george
t.
davis
they
have
not.
now,
we
have
the
feeling,
of
course,
in
view
of
that
situation
that
a
very
damaging
thing
took
place
here
insofar
as
this
man's
rights
are
concerned.
now,
when
this
matter
came
up
before
the
district
court,
of
course,
i
--
obviously
your
honors
are
familiar
with
this
district
court
record.
and
it
was
i
think
the
cast
that
overlays
the
record,
of
course,
is
the
fact
that
judge
goodman
felt
that
he
was
constrained
within
limits
which
as
he
put
it
had
to
do
with
fraud
and
connivance
and
that
unless
the
testimony
to
be
abduced
was
particularly
aimed
at
some
actual
fraud
or
actual
connivance,
he
did
not
feel
that
he
wanted
to
hear,
spend
any
time
on
it.
then
he
said
it
many,
many
times.
mr.
george
t.
davis
well
i
would
--
i
would
want
to
say
this.
that
i
think
that
he
--
that
he
construed
it
within
limitations
that
were
not
necessarily
the
limitations
even
as
to
the
investigation
of
fraud
and
connivance,
because
as
i
see
it
in
this
type
of
case
where
that
leavy
and
the
--
and
the
reporter
conducted
themselves
in
the
manner
that
is
indicated
clearly
in
this
record
and
where
some
parts
of
it
were
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
judge
and
other
parts
weren't.
i
think
that
the
--
there
--
there
should
have
been
a
little
more
liberality
in
construing
what
amounted
to
fraud
and
connivance.
however,
that
would
be
a
matter
that
would
--
it's
a
matter
that
was
argued
out
between
myself
and
the
judge.
and
i
have
to
stand,
of
course,
on
what
he
did
insofar
as
the
record
here
is
concerned.
mr.
george
t.
davis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
t.
davis
we
know
of
--
we
know
of
no
other
case.
we
are
convinced
that
this
is
a
case
of
first
impression.
we
have
found
no
cases
in
the
books
where
this
situation
is
--
is
handled.
we
feel
that
it's
--
it's
without
precedent
insofar
as
our
research
is
concerned
and
certainly
insofar
as
california
is
concerned.
it
is
a
case
of
first
impression,
insofar
as
these
facts
are
concerned.
and
as
you
have
asked
the
question.
mr.
george
t.
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
t.
davis
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
t.
davis
they
were,
your
honor
because
they
were
witnesses
as
to
an
alleged
confession
by
chessman
which
he
denied
at
the
trial
and
which
he
claimed
that
the
trial
had
been
extorted
from
him
by
force.
these
were
the
very
witnesses
to
the
alleged
confession.
and,
of
course,
from
that
point
of
view,
they
were
extremely
important
witnesses
from
mr.
chessman's
decision
on
this
case.
mr.
george
t.
davis
the
night
afterwards.
and
allegedly
after
a
terrific
beating
had
been
imposed
upon
him.
now,
our
--
we
--
that
perhaps
for
the
purposes
of
this
phase
of
the
proceedings,
i
must
say
that
although
i
was
warned
by
everyone
to
watch
that
clock
and
not
ask
questions,
i've
completely
forgotten
the
existence
of
the
clock.
but
our
position
is
such
that
i
think
at
this
stage
that
we
have
--
perhaps
this
sets
forth
the
--
the
general
--
these
facts
and
circumstances.
let
me
say
that
which
we
think
are
basically
of
importance
in
connection
with
this
contention
that
we
have
made
here.
now,
we
feel
that
--
that
our
situation
as
such
that
mr.
chessman
under
these
circumstances
certainly
had
a
right
--
had
a
right
to
give
to
the
court
and
to
give
to
the
preparation
of
this
record
his
own
memory
and
his
own
contribution
insofar
as
trying
to
recall
and
remember
what
had
taken
place.
we
feel
that
he
had
certainly
had
a
right
to
be
allowed
to
do
that.
we
have
that
strange
situation
here
in
this
record
where
he
was
--
where
we
contend
that
he
was
misled
on
that
subject
by
the
district
attorney
who
filed
an
application
in
the
--
or
filed
an
application
in
the
supreme
court
at
a
time
that
mr.
chessman
had
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
prohibition.
mr.
chessman
was
extremely
concerned
about
this
matter
from
the
very
beginning,
and
as
i
say,
not
only
because
it
didn't
conform
or
couldn't
conform
with
mandatory
california
law
but
because
he
was
in
--
of
the
--
the
opinion
that
these
notes
were
indecipherable
and
could
not
be
deciphered.
and
in
this
affidavit
which
we
think
played
a
very
important
part
in
this
situation,
we
have
by
mr.
leavy,
the
district
attorney
an
affidavit
on
file
before
the
california
supreme
court.
and
if
i
might
say,
this
affidavit
was
one
of
the
things
before
the
court,
when
they
finally
came
to
making
the
decision
in
35
cal.2d
to
which
you
have
referred.
here's
the
affidavit
where
mr.
leavy
says
and
it
was
delivered
to
mr.
chessman
in
the
prison.
it
says
that
at
a
time
to
be
later
determined
the
petitioner
will
have
delivered
to
him
in
court
the
reporter's
transcript
to
be
used
as
a
basis
of
the
settlement
of
the
record.
at
said
time,
the
trial
court,
the
honorable
judge
fricke
will
permit
the
petitioner
to
make
corrections
or
to
correct
any
inaccuracies
and
so
forth
that
he
may
claim
in
the
reporter's
transcript.
now,
in
this
--
this
had
some
relevancy,
i
believe,
to
two
or
three
questions
that
were
asked.
he
didn't
ask
to
be
represented
by
counsel
because
on
the
basis
of
this
affidavit
and
he
was
never
told
otherwise
until
after
the
settlement
of
the
transcript.
he
assumed
that
he
would
be
brought
into
court.
this
was
a
sworn
affidavit
by
mr.
leavy.
at
now,
and
to
go
back,
we
take
the
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
t.
davis
yes
it
did,
this
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
yes
and
we
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
this
--
where's
this
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
well,
yes,
it
was.
yes,
your
honor.
it's
in
petitioner's
--
its
exhibit
1,
petitioner's
exhibit
number
1,
jacket
number
11.
it
seems
that
this
exhibit
1
was
broken
up
into
a
large
number
of
jackets,
and
this
is
jacket
number
11.
and
it's
the
--
the
affidavit.
it's
--
it's
in
connection
with
the
document
entitled,
respondent's
points
and
authorities
and
opposition
to
petition
for
writ
of
prohibition,
exhibits
attached.
and
that
is
one
of
the
--
the
exhibits
that
is
attached.
it's
the
last
exhibit
in
that
jacket.
mr.
george
t.
davis
yes.
mr.
george
t.
davis
before
i
answer
that
judge,
if
i'm
--
if
you'll
allow
me.
may
i
--
will
you
please
state
that
question
again?
mr.
george
t.
davis
i
understand
that.
mr.
george
t.
davis
i
understand
that.
mr.
george
t.
davis
probably
not.
but
there
is
another
side
to
that
which
i
think
i
must
mention.
we
would
--
we
would
certainly
be
here
if
we
were
allowed
to
come
here
to
protest
whether
or
not
such
a
record
could
be
provided
and
could
be
used
under
the
mandatory
provisions
of
the
california
law.
mr.
george
t.
davis
that
is
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
i
--
i
agree
with
that.
that
is
correct.
such
a
--
as
such
in
the
inherent
effect
as
to
the
--
this
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
--
defect
as
to
destroy
its
validity.
that
is
correct.
that
is
our
contention.
mr.
george
t.
davis
no.
that
--
that's
--
that's
on
top
of
it.
we
claim
that
he
--
that
first
of
all,
we
claim
in
answer
to
the
judge's
question
or
with
line
–
in
line
of
the
judge's
position,
we
claim
that
this
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
well,
i
beg
your
pardon.
in
line
with
the
judge's
statements,
in
order
to
clarify
this,
we
claim
that
there
was
--
that
there
was
and
is
in
connection
with
this
record
an
inherent
defect
that
it
is
not
a
true
record.
it's
spurious,
false
record
as
it
is
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
--
that
it
was
put
together.
mr.
george
t.
davis
well,
that
is
right.
but
we
have
taken
the
position.
and
we
have
been
confronted
with
that,
of
course,
every
way
along
the
line
in
a
proceeding
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
appeal
but
was
--
which
was
a
--
a
proceeding
prior
to
the
appeal
so
to
speak.
the
court
made
that
decision.
and,
of
course,
they
took
the
position
also
that
he
had
no
right
to
be
present
to
participate
in
the
activity.
that
it
was
the
appellate
in
nature.
and
as
i
recall
35
cal,
they
just
took
the
general
position
that
due
process
did
not
apply.
mr.
george
t.
davis
on
the
35
cal,
i
believe
that
that
was
done
by
a
written
argument
by
mr.
chessman.
mr.
george
t.
davis
he
had
no
lawyer
before
the
court
at
that
time.
mr.
george
t.
davis
he
did
not.
mr.
george
t.
davis
well,
basically,
the
--
the
undisclosed
relationship
between
mr.
fraser
that
reporter
who
was
obtained
and
between
mr.
--
and
this
between
mr.
fraser
and
between
the
district
attorney.
and
secondly,
the
complete
story
of
the
method
by
rough
draft
and
by
rough
draft
on
top
of
rough
draft
between
mr.
leavy
and
mr.
fraser
before
a
final
transcript
was
made.
and
then
thirdly,
the
fact
that
mr.
fraser
is
now
revealed
to
have
gone
to
prosecution
witnesses
outside
of
any
courtroom
or
any
activity
known
to
any
court
and
had
taken
up
with
them
their
memory
of
what
they
had
testified
to,
so
that
he
might
perfect
and
prepare
a
transcript
of
their
testimony.
mr.
george
t.
davis
he
said
that
he
couldn't
--
he,
mr.
fraser
was
very
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
it
was
in
los
angeles.
mr.
george
t.
davis
he
said
that
he
went
--
first
of
all,
he
said
he
went
to
the
policeman's
offices.
he
--
he
was
sure
that
he
went
to
colin
forbes'
office
which
is
one
of
them
--
no,
to
lieutenant
jones'
office.
he
thought
he
met
the
other
one
in
his
office
also.
then
he
got
very
vague
about
the
subject
and
said
that
leavy
had
been
along
and
then
he
became
very
vague
about
where
it
was.
mr.
george
t.
davis
there
is
no
possible
questionable
doubt
about
that.
mr.
george
t.
davis
i
don't
know
of
any
such
minute
or
any
such
record
that
was
made.
this
came
to
our
attention.
i'd
like
to
say
with
almost
a
startling
suddenness.
in
the
course
of
the
hearings
before
judge
goodman
when
mr.
--
mr.
bennett
who
was
questioning
mr.
fraser
and
who
undoubtedly
anticipated
that
this
might
develop,
mr.
bennett
asked
mr.
fraser
if
he
had
spoken
to
anybody
else.
he
said,
"who
did
you
talk
to
outside
of
mr.
leavy
and
outside
of
the
fact
that
mr.
fraser
said
that
he'd
left
the
notes
--
these
original
notes
with
his
brother
and
his
wife.
who
did
you
talk
to,
he
said.
and
mr.
fraser
answered
that
he
talked
to
a
mr.
collins
and
mr.
forbes
and
then
he
proceeded
along
without
asking
him
who
they
were
or
what
they
were
or
what
he
talked
about.
mr.
george
t.
davis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
t.
davis
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
i
have
found
--
discuss
it
quickly
that
will
clarify
--
just
a
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
i
did,
sir.
but
there
is
a
matter
of
question
that
was
asked
and
i
have
to
take
it
in
order
to
be
clear
about
it,
if
i
may.
i
understand
i
have
only
a
few
minutes
but
let
me
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
may
it
please
the
court.
in
connection
with
one
question
that
was
asked
with
reference
to
when
mr.
chessman
learned
that
stanley
fraser
was
related
to
mr.
leavy.
there's
a
series
of
--
of
pieces
of
information
about
this.
the
--
there
was
a
letter
and
i
--
it's
in
the
petitioner's
exhibit
number
12.
there
was
letter
written
to
mr.
chessman
in
--
in
july
of
1948.
this
letter
--
i'm
not
sure
that
this
letter
was
--
was
allowed
in
evidence
but
i
believe
i
know
it's
in
this
file
at
least
for
identification.
and
in
connection
with
this
subject,
it
was
a
letter
from
emily
matthews
who
was
the
wife
of
the
man
who
sat
as
an
adviser
during
chessman's
trial.
in
the
course
of
that
letter
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
as
an
adviser
to
mr.
chessman.
in
the
course
of
that
letter,
she
said,
and
it
appears
just
above
in
the
middle
of
this
handwritten
page,
"the
record
is
in
sad
page,
they
have
the
third
man
on
it
now,
and
al
is
quite
elated
as
he
is
m.
l.
wife's
cousin.
now,
this
is
clarified
by
a
later
statement
by
mr.
chessman.
they
have
the
third
man
on
and
he
is
m.
l.
wife's
cousin.
subsequently,
a
letter
was
written
to
mr.
chessman
on
october
the
12th,
1948,
which
incidentally
was
after
that
letter
that
had
been
sent
by
mr.
persons
(ph),
that
court
reporter,
who
said
that
these
notes
were
undecipherable.
this
came
to
mr.
chessman
from
al
matthews
and
he
says,
"the
judge
told
me
when
the
record
was
completed
he
was
going
to
bring
you
down
here
for
the
purpose
of
having
an
agreed
settlement
of
the
record."
now,
that
was
a
letter
from
mr.
matthews.
i
must
say
in
fairness
to
judge
fricke,
that
judge
fricke
did
testify
that
mr.
matthews
had
apparently
misunderstood
him.
but
that,
of
course,
was
not
known
to
mr.
chessman
in
anyway
because
that's
the
letter
that
he
received
from
mr.
matthews.
now,
i
go
to
mr.
chessman's
testimony
in
the
hearings
before
judge
goodman.
and
at
the
time
he
was
testifying,
ms.asher
who
was
interrogating
him
said
to
him,
"did
you
at
that
time"
--
speaking
now
of
the
july,
1948
letter
from
emily,
“did
you
at
that
time
relate
that
reference
to
m.
l.'s
wife's
cousin
to
stanley
fraser?"
chessman
said,
"i
had
never
heard
the
name
stanley
fraser
in
my
life
so
i
was
unable
to
do
so."
"when
did
you
first
hear
the
name
stanley
fraser?"
answer
"some
time
shortly
before,
so
far
as
i
can
recall,
the
transcripts
were
filed."
now,
i
am
referring
not
to
the
augmented
record
but
to
the
original
transcripts
under
the
original
contract
which
was
in
1949.
i
don't
remember
exactly.
"now,
mr.
chessman,
when
did
you
first
learn
of
the
relationship
between
mr.
stanley
fraser
and
mr.
j.
m.
leavy?
answer
"some
time
in
may
of
1954.
i
was
at
san
quentin
and
i
had
a
date."
and
i
am
reading
incidentally
from
pages
572
and
573
of
this
record,
volume
7.
"i
--
i
was
at
san
quentin
and
i
had
a
date
for
execution
in
a
few
more
days.
i
had
retained
berwyn
rice
as
counsel
who
was
the
first
attorney
i'd
had
since
these
proceedings
began."
he
told
me
he'd
just
returned
from
a
trip
to
los
angeles.
during
the
course
of
the
investigation
down
there,
he
asked
me
first,
did
i
know
that
the
reporter
who
had
prepared
this
record
was
related
to
the
prosecutor.
and
i
told
him
no,
that
i
didn't.
and
he
said
well,
i
have
information
that
he
is.
now,
mrs.
--
ms.
asher
proceeded
to
ask
him
one
further
question
and
asked
him
whether
he
knew
or
whether
he
didn't
know
when
that
original
letter
said
that
he
was
m.
l.'s
cousin
that
he
was
referring
that
--
that
emily
was
referring
to
miller
leavy.
and
he
answered,
in
the
course
of
his
questioning,
that
he
didn't
know
that
because
he
assumed,
he
said
here
--
he
said
that
he
assumed
from
the
letter
that
this
was
the
third
man
working
on
the
notes.
he
didn't
know
that
that
was
the
man
who
actually
was
retained
or
would
be
retained
to
transcribe
the
notes.
and
so,
he
didn't
put
it
together
and,
of
course,
m.
l.'s
cousin
meant
nothing
to
him
so
far
as
fraser
was
concerned
until
his
own
counsel
told
him
about
it
for
the
first
time
in
1954.
then
i
--
i
call
your
attention
to
volume
6,
the
testimony
of
mr.
fraser
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
yes.
testimony
of
mr.
fraser
on
this
particular
question
by
me.
question
"at
the
time
--
just
to
digress
for
a
moment,
at
the
time
he
went
to
see
judge
fricke
in
his
chambers
--
did
you
tell
judge
fricke
that
you
were
related
to
mr.
leavy
in
any
sense
or
degree?"
and
his
answer
is,
"no,
i
did
not."
and
it
develops
that
he
never
made
that
disclosure
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
--
to
judge
fricke.
that
is
page
322,
your
honor,
of
--
of
volume
number
6.
now,
in
that
same
volume
and
i
don't
wish
to
take
the
time
to
read
it,
but
i
would
call
your
attention
that
his
testimony
is
in
that
volume
regarding
those
police
officers,
(inaudible)
and
he
says,
that
he
went
to
see
them
to
get
all
the
light
that
he
could
about
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
that's
page
417,
418
and
419.
and
the
direct
examination
on
that
question
appears
at
page
396
in
the
same
volume
where
mr.
bennett
asked
him
if
he'd
seen
anybody
else
and
he
said
yes,
(inaudible)
and
then
stopped.
now,
i
ask
your
honors
also,
if
i
may,
i
direct
your
attention
to
that
same
volume
to
pages
321
and
322,
and
331,
and
339
were
he
discusses
the
relationship
between
himself
and
mr.
leavy
with
reference
to
these
notes.
he
says,
he
took
him
over
to
mr.
leavy's
home
to
where
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
that
is
all
your
honor.
i
had
a
reference
to
page
203
where
he
refers
to
his
outside
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
sir?
it's
in
the
--
it's
in
the
preceding
volume.
mr.
george
t.
davis
in
volume
5,
your
honor.
page
203
where
he
referred
to
his
contacts
with
mr.
leavy
and
with
the
judge
and
also
to
page
329
where
he
says
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
that's
the
same.
that's
volume
number
6,
your
honor.
in
that
329,
where
he
says
that
although
all
other
documents
are
still
available,
he
destroyed
the
rough
draft
notes.
now,
we
have
consumed
our
time
and
i'm
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
t.
davis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
t.
davis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
t.
davis
oh,
i'm
certain
that
it
does
because
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
t.
davis
may
we
do
that
in
our
reply
brief.
i
understand
we
have
seven
days
to
make
a
brief,
to
get
--
or
answer
a
brief
or
do
you
wish
it
before
then.
mr.
george
t.
davis
because
while
i'm
certain
that
he
complained
bitterly
that
the
whole
thing
had
been
lost
in
the
final
transcription.
mr.
george
t.
davis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
t.
davis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
t.
davis
yes.
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
t.
davis
there
apparently
were
--
was
sequence
of
--
of
raw
records
plus
a
raw
record
--
plus
a
raw
record
and
then
a
final
record.
mr.
george
t.
davis
that
is
right.
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
george
t.
davis
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
t.
davis
they
had
--
he
said,
himself,
that
he
had
destroyed
the
underlying
data.
and
i
--
i
think,
your
honors,
i'm
sorry
i
can't
make
a
peroration
now
and
to
explain,
but
i
suppose
that
if
mr.
justice
said
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
and
may
we
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
may
we
offer,
sir,
your
honors,
to,
of
course,
to
submit
to
--
any
further
questions
that
occur
before
we
close
because,
of
course,
this
is
life
and
death
to
our
client
and
