justice
john
m.
harlan
was
that
letter
before
judge
fricke?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that
--
that
inference
that's
been
drawn
from
that
language
as
you
refer
to
is
that
he
didn't
know
that
the
reporter
was
dead.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
apart
from
that,
what
are
the
facts
as
to
what
he
knew
about
what
the
judge
and
fraser
and
leavy
were
doing
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
to
compare
this
to
our
record?
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
the
california
supreme
court
have
before
it
the
relationship
between
the
stenographer
fraser
and
the
district
attorney?
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
it
have
before
it
the
interviewing
of
witnesses
by
the
stenographer
and
the
district
attorney
in
chessman's
absence?
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
chessman
know
it
that
at
time?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
now
do
you
really
think
that
that's
a
fair
characterization
of
that
record?
i
have
read
this
record
and
i
recognize
what
you
say
that
he
didn't
--
judge
goodman
did
make
these
remarks
that
even
75%
was
wrong,
and
so
forth?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
i
fail
to
find
in
the
record
anything
that
is
a
practical
matter,
slapped
you
off
or
prevented
you
from
proving
almost
anything
that
you
have
to
prove.
justice
john
m.
harlan
am
i
wrong
about
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
--
i
thought
the
record
on
that
was
that
fraser
said
that
he
couldn't
sit
down
and
read
them
in
the
presence
of
the
judge.
he
had
to
study
them.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
he'd
offered
to
take
them
home
with
him
and
do
come
back
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
with
whatever
portion
you
wanted
deciphered
and
come
back
in
the
morning
and
testify
what
it
was
and
you
said
you
weren't
interested?
justice
john
m.
harlan
am
i
not
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'd
like
to
ask
you
another
question.
justice
john
m.
harlan
under
the
california
practice,
is
there
any
other
case
between
their
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
who
argued
--
who
argued
and
represented
chessman
on
the
california,
the
state
court
appeal
that
involved
the
accuracy
of
the
record?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
he
had
no
lawyer?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
does
that
mean,
compare
a
settled
statement?
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
that
apply
to
capital
cases?
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
that
include
chessman's
testimony?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
is
the
document
where
we'll
find
his
objections
and
on
what
the
court
deal
with
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
he
is
part
of
the
public
defender's
office.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
do
you
say
to
this
proposition?
that
as
a
result
of
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding,
this
present
proceeding,
there's
been
a
developed
material
which
everybody
seems
to
recognize,
it
was
not
in
chessman's
possession
at
the
time
of
the
state
court
review
of
this
record.
and
that
therefore,
the
state
court
has
never
passed
upon
the
settlement
of
that
record
in
light
of
(a),
the
interviewing
of
these
witnesses
by
the
prosecutor
and
--
and
the
stenographer
and
(b),
the
relationship
between
chessman
between
the
stenographer
and
the
prosecutor.
