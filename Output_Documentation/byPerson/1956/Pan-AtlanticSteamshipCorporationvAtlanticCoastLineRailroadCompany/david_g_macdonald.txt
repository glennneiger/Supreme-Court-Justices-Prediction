mr.
david
g.
macdonald
i'm
mr.
macdonald,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
i
speak
for
pan-atlantic
steamship
corporation,
appellant,
in
case
number
408.
our
position
is
the
same
as
that
as
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
case
number
424,
which
is
then,
consolidated
this
case
number
408
for
argument.
i
have
attempted
to
divide
my
argument
with
mr.
murray
who
will
represent
the
interstate
commerce
commission
so
as
to
avoid
repetitions
since
the
issue
in
both
cases
is
the
same.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
decision
by
the
united
states
district
court
of
massachusetts,
setting
as
a
three-judge
court
on
a
problem
arising
from
an
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
there
is
one
issue
present,
an
issue
of
statutory
construction
and
that
issue
is
whether
or
not
the
third
sentence
of
section
9
(b)
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
authorized
or
required
the
commission
to
extend
beyond
180
days,
a
temporary
authority
which
it
had
previously
issued
under
section
311
(a)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
at
page
4
of
our
brief,
which
is
the
quite
brief,
it
has
the
name
pan-atlantic,
is
set
forth
the
two
statutes,
which
you
were
asked
to
construe
in
these
proceeding.
at
the
middle
of
the
page,
page
3,
i
should
have
said
instead
of
page
4,
is
the
text
of
section
311
(a),
which
is
a
provision
by
which
the
interstate
commerce
commission
is
authorized
to
permit
a
temporary
operation
which
we
call
a
license
or
temporary
license
in
these
proceeding,
to
meet
an
immediate
and
urgent
need
for
which
there
is
no
other
water
carrier
service
available.
there
is
a
limitation
in
the
last
sentence
there
that
the
commission
shall
not
grant
such
an
authority
for
aggregate
of
more
than
180
days.
substantially,
an
enactment
of
that
provision,
congress
passed
the
administrative
procedure
act,
which
as
this
court
has
held
was
an
attempt
to
codify
the
various
procedural
due
process
requirements
of
administrative
agencies.
one
of
the
provisions
of
that
act
was
section
(9)
(b)
which
deals
with
licensing
activities.
this
is
a
licensing
activity.
the
temporary
authority,
which
pan-atlantic
was
granted,
is
a
temporary
license
to
conduct
an
intercoastal
steamship
operation
between
the
atlantic
and
pacific
coast.
the
third
sentence
of
(9)
(b)
says
that,
“in
the
case
of
a
temporary
license,
when
certain
jurisdictional
facts
are
present,
the
license
shall
not
expire
if
there
is
a
pending
renewal
or
new
application,
which
has
been
timely
filed
in
accordance
with
agency
rules.”
the
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
in
the
phase
--
in
phase
of
the
apparent
conflict
between
these
two
provisions,
the
180-day
limitation
of
section
311
(a)
that
the
temporary
authority
has
granted
should
not
be
for
aggregate
of
more
than
180
days.
and
then,
in
section
(9)
(b)
which
says,
that
”when
there
is
such
a
temporary
license,
it
shall
not
expire
if
there
is
impending,
a
new
or
renewal
application
for
an
activity
of
a
continuing
nature.”
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
the
request
was
made
that
the
commission
extend
the
temporary
authority
in
this
--
in
this
form.
as
you'll
notice,
section
(9)
(b)
doesn't
give
the
commission
licensing
power.
it
acts
directly
on
the
license
itself.
a
request
was
made
to
the
commission
to
make
the
jurisdictional
findings,
which
have
to
be
made
under
(9)
(b),
which
are
--
that
there
was
an
application
pending
if
this
was
an
activity
of
a
continuing
nature.
and
thereupon,
to
give
in
effect
public
notice
that
the
--
in
fact,
section
(9)
(b)
did
have
effect
and
was
acting
to
extend
the
temporary
authority.
such
request
was
made
and
the
commission
did
issue
a
second
order,
and
as
the
second
order,
that's
an
issue
here.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
the
--
in
the
record,
its
transcript

is
the
commission's
order
of
may
18th,
which
granted
to
pan-atlantic
a
180-day
authority
to
operate
intercoastal.
at
transcript

is
the
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
dated
october
28,
1955,
which
extended
that
temporary
authority,
the
first
temporary
authority
until
such
time
as
the
then
pending
application
for
permanent
authority
would
be
decided.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
the
entire
proceeding
is
ex
parte
in
the
sense
that
you
use
the
word,
i
believe,
your
honor.
section
3
(11)
(a)
is
an
emergency
procedure,
which
was
added
to
the
act.
i
might
say
this,
this
provision
is
somewhere
to
the
one
in
the
motor
carrier
act
which
is
passed
in
1935.
the
similar
provision
in
the
motor
carrier
act
was
added
by
the
commission's
request
sometime
after
1935.
and
when
the
water
carrier
act
was
passed
in
1940,
it
was
included
in
that
section.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
on
the
original
application,
there
was
an
application
to
the
commission
accompanied
by
supporting
statements
of
the
users,
the
proposed
users
to
this
service,
which
served
to
establish
that
there
was
an
urgent
and
immediate
need
for
which
no
other
carrier
service
was
available.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
the
commission
gave
notice
to
the
competitive
carriers.
they
filed
their
approach
as
an
objections.
the
commission
then
reached
this
decision.
there
was
no
hearing
held.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
the
same
thing,
the
--
the
appellees
in
each
instance
filed
a
document
with
the
commission
opposing
the
action.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
that
is
correct.
the
reason
for
is
set
forth
in
the
legislative
history
which
we
have
set
forth
at
some
length
in
our
brief
and
i
will
advert
to
that
later
when
mr.
murray
return.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
thank
you,
sir.
as
i
said
before
the
recess,
this
was
a
suit
by
the
railroad
appellees
to
set
aside
the
order
of
october
28th,
1955,
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
which
either
itself
extended
the
previously
granted
temporary
authority
or
recognized
that
the
section
9
(b)
in
itself
acted
upon
the
previously
granted
temporary
authority
to
extend
it.
the
position
of
the
railroads
was
not
that
the
commission
abused
this
discretion
in
granting
this
order
of
october
28
but
that
it
lacks
statutory
authority
to
do
the
act.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
this
is
a
practice
which
began,
sir,
in
1947,
and
has
continued.
since
that
time,
there
had
been,
i
believe
brief
show,
probably
a
thousand
similar
orders
entered.
about
three
years
ago,
the
--
for
the
first
time,
an
--
an
attack
was
made
on
the
validity
of
that
action
by
the
commission
in
a
case
which
is
appendix
b
of
our
brief
stone's
express,
inc.versus
u.s.
that
suit,
the
stone's
express
suit
also
arose
in
the
united
states
district
court
from
massachusetts.
as
a
consequence,
when
this
case
was
presented
to
the
same
court,
the
lower
court
took
the
position
that
the
matter
was
already
decided
and
that
it
would
not
change
its
position
but
would
be
bound
by
its
previous
position
in
the
stone's
express
case.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
judge
ford.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
i'm
not
certain
as
to
the
third
one.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
in
--
in
the
--
in
our
case,
judges
magruder,
wyzanski
and
ford
sat.
in
the
stone's
express
case,
we
had
one
of
the
three
who
would
--
i
mean
in
our
case,
we
had
one
of
the
three
who
would
sat
in
the
stone's
express
case,
that
was
judge
ford.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
that's
correct.
he
--
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
that
is
correct,
indicating
a
change
in
--
in
his
attitude
towards
the
problem
presented.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
okay.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
that
was
the
point
i
was
going
to
make
next
that
while
we
were
the
defendants
below,
because
the
court
indicated
to
is
prior
argument
that
if
this
was
the
same
issue
presented
in
the
stone's
express
case,
we
could
expect
the
same
result.
we
did
get
the
same
result.
we
lost
the
case
below
but
two
of
the
three
judges
in
a
concurring
opinion
indicated
that
were
the
matter
presented
for
the
first
time
to
that
court
rather
than
being
bound
by
stone's
express,
they
would
have
viewed
it
differently.
as
a
consequence,
we
have
no
decision
of
--
no
independent
decision
of
the
lower
court
in
this
case
to
look
to
for
the
reasoning
supporting
the
decision.
we
have
to
look
to
the
earlier
decision
in
the
stone's
express
case
which
in
effect
was
adopted
by
the
court
in
this
case.
the
question
--
the
holding
in
the
--
in
the
stone's
express
case
was
at
section
9
(b),
the
third
sentence
that
we're
concerned
with,
did
not
authorize
interstate
commerce
commission
to
extend
a
temporary
authority
issued
under
section
210
(a)
(b).
that
is
a
similar
but
slightly
different
provision
than
the
one
we're
dealing
with.
section
210
(a)
(b)
is
a
portion
of
the
motor
carrier
act
which
authorizes
the
--
the
grant
of
temporary
authority
to
one
carrier
to
operate
the
properties
of
another
to
preserve
those
properties
from
eminent
loss
during
the
pendency
of
an
acquisition
proceeding.
it's
one
of
the
four
sections
in
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
deal
with
temporary
licenses
and
i
believe
it's
generally
conceded
that
the
decision
of
this
court
will
determine
the
status
of
all
four
of
those
sections
rather
than
just
section
311
(a),
since
they
all
contain
a
180-day
limitation.
the
reasoning
in
--
of
the
court
in
the
stone
case
was
found
in
two
different
propositions.and
they
both
have
to
do
with
the
language
of
section
9
(b),
which
i
referred
you
to
at
page
3
of
our
brief.
the
first
point
was
that
the
court
found
that
for
9
(b)
to
be
applicable,
the
person
who
was
seeking
to
have
a
temporary
license
renewed,
would
have
to
have
filed
an
application
at
the
time
that
it
was
a
licensee.
this
is
a
very
technical
point.
in
other
words,
they
said
that
to
get
to
this
case
that
we
have
at
bar,
pan-atlantic
file
its
application
for
temporary
authority
on
or
about
may
8,
1955.
that
on
the
same
day,
it
filed
an
application
for
permanent
authority.
the
temporary
authority
application
was
granted
on
may
18th,
10
days
later.
therefore,
the
application
for
permanent
authority
was
pending
before
it
became
a
licensee
by
reason
of
receiving
the
temporary
authority.
the
court
in
the
stone's
express
case
where
the
similar
situation
was
presented,
said
that
9
(b)
doesn't
apply
because
you
have
to
read
it
as
of
the
time
when
the
application
for
a
new
or
renewal
license
was
filed.
i'll
come
back
to
that
point
in
a
moment.
the
second
reason
of
this
court
in
the
stone's
express
case
is
more
fundamental.
the
court
held
that
section
9
(b)
taken
as
a
licensing
authority
grant
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
is
in
conflict
with
section
311
(a).
and
that
repeal
by
implication
is
not
favored.
in
other
words,
the
court
said
--
311
(a)
says
that
you
can
grant
these
temporary
licenses
for
a
maximum
of
180
days.
you
say
under
9
(b)
that
you've
extended
this
license
beyond
180
days,
and
that
9
(b)
gives
you
authority
to
do
that.
this
is
a
conflict
in
terms
between
these
two
sections.
the
administrative
procedure
act
containing
section
9
(b)
was
passed
after
section
311
(a).
therefore,
we
say
we
resolve
the
conflict
in
favor
of
the
earlier
statute.
our
position
on
these
points,
and
these
were
the
only
two
points
which
were
the
underlying
reasons
why
the
court
in
the
stone's
express
case
held
the
way
it
did.
is
it
a
license
holder
--
the
--
as
to
the
first
point,
that
the
license
holder
must
be
a
license
holder
not
when
the
application
for
renewal
or
a
new
license
is
filed,
but
in
accordance
with
agency
rules,
it
must
be
one
before
the
expiration
of
the
license.
and
our
reasoning
depends
primarily
just
on
the
language
of
the
section.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
reading
--
reading
the
--
yes.
the
temporary
license
that
we
had,
we
received
on
may
18th.
we
were
an
applicant
for
a
permanent
license
to
continue
the
same
activity
on
may
8th.
that
is
still
pending.
it
has
not
yet
been
determined.
the
--
the
section
9
(b),
under
which
the
temporary
authority
was
extended,
provides
that
in
any
--
and
i'm
quoting,
"in
any
case
in
which
the
licensee
has,
in
accordance
with
agency
rules,
made
timely
and
sufficient
application
for
a
renewal
or
a
new
license,
no
license
with
reference
to
any
activity
of
a
continuing
nature
shall
expire
until
such
application
shall
have
been
finally
determined
by
the
agency.”
the
court
in
the
stone's
express
case,
looking
at
that
language
said
this,
“the
third
sentence
of
section
9
(b),
however,
in
using
the
words,
“in
any
case
in
which
the
licensee
has
made
timely
and
sufficient
application
for
a
renewal
or
a
new
license.”
indicates
that
the
statute
presupposes
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
application
the
existence
of
the
license."
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
the
court
said
in
effect
that
pan-atlantic
would
have
had
to
--
who
held
the
license,
granted
to
it
on
may
18th
on
may
8th
at
the
time
when
it
filed
its
application
for
a
permanent
authority.
it
had
to
be
a
temporary
licensee
at
the
time
it
filed
its
application
for
a
new
or
renewal
license.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
yes.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
that
is,
sir.
and
that
is
our
position.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
i
think
the
court
has
automatically
gone
to
the
position
that
we
take
in
this
case.
the
statute
reads,
"as
of
the
time
when
the
temporary
license
is
due
to
expire,"
that's
the
important
feature.
and
we
were
a
temporary
licensed
--
licensee
--
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
--
at
the
time
that
the
--
that
the
act
9
(b)
acted
to
extend
it.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
i
don't
believe
that's
exactly
correct,
sir.
what
the
--
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
what
the
court
really
had
in
mind
was
this.
and
i'll
illustrate
it
with
the
case
that
we
have
in
bar
--
at
bar.
they
said
that
pan-atlantic
should
have
acquired
its
temporary
license
before
it
filed
its
application
for
a
renewal
or
a
new
license,
where
it
matters
to
--
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
we
had
a
temporary
but
we
--
and
we
filed
for
both
simultaneously.
we
received
the
temporary
license
on
may
18th,
whereas
yet
have
yet
received
the
other
one.
consequently,
at
the
time
we
filed
for
the
permanent
application,
we
were
not
yet
a
licensee.
we
were
on
the
--
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
no,
we
didn't
get
that
until
may
18th.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
that's
the
point.
that's
the
court
--
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
oh,
yes,
sir.
and
that
is
the
--
i'll
say
it's
a
technical
distinction
--
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
--
and
it
serves
no
purpose
except
to
controvert
the
purpose
of
section
9
(b).
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
well,
in
--
in
--
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
court
added
to
the
rationale
i've
just
given
to
adopt
the
--
the
interpretation
that
i've
given.
that
was
a
--
and
i
think
that
that
is
one
point
and
i
should
--
state
this
now.
very
much
an
issue.
and
that
is
whether
or
not
the
ohio
statute
was
adopted
by
congress.
you'll
notice
that
the
language
quoted
in
the
stone's
express
case
and
for
the
guidance
of
the
court,
that's
forth
also
in
appendix
b,
within
the
context
of
the
stone's
express
case,
at
page
6a
of
the
appendix
b.
the
court
there
pointed
out
to
or
pointed
to
a
senate
judiciary
committee
print,
referring
to
see
administrative
procedure
act
and
in
--
after
referring
to
the
third
sentence
of
section
9
(b)
said,
"a
similar
provision
is
contained
in
the
licensing
procedure
act
for
the
state
of
ohio."
now,
does
that
mean
that
congress
adopted
the
language?
recalling
now
that
we're
not
dealing
with
an
essential
element
of
9
(b)
but
of
a
technical
point
whether
or
not
the
licensee
had
to
be
such
at
the
time
he
filed
for
the
new
license.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
it
did
not
sir.
it
specifically
omitted
that
language
because
if
it's
true
that
it
considered
the
language
of
the
ohio
act,
it's
clear
that
it
didn't
adopt
that
language.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
that
is
exactly
correct,
sir.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
that
is
the
contention
raised
by
the
appellees
on
their
brief
in
this
proceeding
as
i
understand
it.
they've
gone
beyond
the
lower
court's
decision.
i
might
say
that
their
brief,
and
presents
a
new
argument
which
was
not
considered
by
the
court
below
at
all
and
not
presented
to
the
court
below
at
all,
which
is
that
the
ohio
statute,
if
we
assume
that
it
was
adopted,
that
its
language
we
should
suppose
was
adopted
by
congress.
although,
the
section
9
(d)
doesn't
contain
it.
then
we
must
take
another
part
of
that
ohio
act.
and
that
is
the
contention
that
the
words
of
the
ohio
act,
that
the
license
must
be
of
the
same
type
or
class,
should
be
incorporated
in
9
(b)
as
well.
that
is
the
--
an
additional
and
different
point
than
the
one
that
the
court
made
as
to
this
first
point
about
the
--
where
you
had
to
be
a
licensee
at
the
time
that
the
application
was
filed.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
i
--
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
we
have
dealt
with
that,
sir,
in
our
reply
briefs.
our
shortness
of
time
will
not
make
it
possible
for
me
to
deal
with
that
at
length.
but
i
think
what
i
have
to
say
as
to
these
other
issues
and
what
we've
already
shown
that
the
congress
didn't
adopt
that
language
defeats
that
whole
argument.
it
all
rests
on
the
premise
that
congress
adopted
the
language
of
the
ohio
act,
which
it
clearly
did
not
do.
the
second
point
--
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
the
fact
that
they
knew
we
were
applying
for
a
permanent
license
would
make
the
commission
more
careful
to
see
that
they
didn't
inadvertently
grant
one
that
shouldn't
be
granted
--
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
--
because
they
knew
that
it
would
be
automatically
extended
until
that
the
final
decision
in
the
application
case,
the
permanent
application
case.
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
i
wanted
him
before
closing
on
that
point,
to
point
this
out.
the
purpose
of
section
9
(b)
was
to
protect
people
who
must
get
licenses
in
order
to
continue
a
continuing
activity
having
to
suspend
that
because
of
delays
in
administrative
action.
that's
set
forth
at
--
at
length
in
the
briefs,
i
think
of
all
the
parties.
that
the
purpose
of
that,
there's
no
question
about
it,
was
do
what
just
what
it
--
the
commission
used
it
for
in
this
case.
they
had
a
proceeding.
it's
going
on
now.
this
is
1957.
the
--
it
is
now
pending
before
the
commission
for
decision,
this
permanent
application
case.
it's
been
almost
two
years.
it's
physically
impossible
for
the
commission
to
complete
this
class
of
proceeding
in
much
less
than
that
time.
they
--
this
statute,
section
9
(b),
they
extended
the
authority
and
we
say
the
commission
didn't
do
it.
the
statute
did
it.
it
acts
directly
on
the
license,
if
you
look
at
the
wording
of
9
(b).
it
acts
directly
on
the
license
to
extend
it
because
it's
a
protection
to
the
license
holder
against
the
agency,
against
the
dilatory
action
of
the
agency
or
failure
of
action.
i
don't
blame
it
on
the
agency
because
the
administrative
procedure
act
is
a
viable
to
protect
the
--
the
vested
rights
of
license
holders.
and
that
is
the
argument
they
make.
they
are
certificate
holders.
they
are
entitled
protection
against
unneeded
transportation.
we
agree
--
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
that's
correct,
sir.
the
--
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
the
--
the
--
that
they
must
--
that
they
must
find
that
it's
activity
of
a
continuing
nature
and
if
there
has
been
an
application
filed
for
a
new
or
renew
a
license
within
the
scope
of
the
agency
rules.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
that
is
set
forth
in
appendix
d
of
our
brief.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
no
question.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
that
is
true,
sir.
we
have
two
policies
here
and
--and
they're
--
they're
fundamental
to
both
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
administrative
procedure
act.
one
is,
that
there
shouldn't
be
an
oversupply
of
transportation
and
therefore,
certain
procedures
must
be
followed
before
new
licenses
of
a
permanent
nature
are
created.
we
agree
that
is
so.
on
the
other
hand,
we
have
the
policy
recognized
in
these
four
emergency
sections.
it
says
the
public
is
also
entitled
to
service.
the
national
transportation
policy
also
sets
that
forth.
and
there's
a
reconciliation
between
those
two
policies
which
is
set
forth
in
section
9
(b)
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
the
administrative
procedure
act
guarantees
the
licensed
holders
that
there
shall
not
be
created
unnecessary
permanent
licenses.
section
--
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
those
--
i
wasn't
referring
to
section
9
(b)
when
the
--
in
that
comment,
sir.
those
provisions
in
--
in
the
earlier
parts
of
the
section
--
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
guarantee
that
there
must
be
a
notice.
there
must
hearing,
and
so
on.
those
are
all
procedural
rights
given
to
the
--
those
persons
who
hold
right
to
hold
the
certificates
and
are
in
effect
the
best
of
interest.
the
fact
they
have
those
rights,
gives
them
the
power
to
delay
these
proceedings
for
up
to
two
and
three
years.
balancing
the
policy
consideration,
congress
in
section
9
(b),
in
the
third
sentence,
provided
that
where
there
is
a
--
a
temporary
license,
which
as
i
pointed
out
is
here
created
because
of
an
urgent
and
immediate
need
with
carrier
service
able
to
provide
it.
where
congress
says
--
or
where
the
commission
has
created
such
a
--
a
license
for
a
continuing
activity,
congress
provided
in
section
9
(b)
that
that
license
should
stay
in
effect
until
the
agency
had
completed
the
agency
processing
on
the
permanent
application.
that
is
a
subtraction
from
the
rights
which
the
administrative
procedure
act,
otherwise,
grants
to
the
holders
of
certificates
to
prevent
the
needless
creation
of
new
certificates.
the
dual
purpose
of
--
of
section
311
(a)
has
a
bearing
on
that
point.
and
that
is
the
second
point
of
the
court
in
the
stone's
express
case.
they
felt
that
there
was
a
conflict
between
the
statutes.
as
we
pointed
out,
section
311
(a),
the
180-day
limitation
is
a
limitation
on
the
commission.
that's
a
licensing
grant
--
a
power,
a
licensing
authority
granted
to
the
commission,
311
(a).
section
9
(b)
is
not
a
licensing
authority
granted
to
the
commission.
if
it
were,
instead
of
saying
no
license
shall
expire,
they
would
have
said,
no
license
shall
be
permitted
to
expire.
but
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
no
license
shall
expire,
that's
directly
on
the
license.
the
court
in
the
stone's
express
case
failed
to
see
that
distinction
and
it
was
not
urged
upon
the
court.
when
we
urged
it
upon
the
court
in
the
present
case,
i
believe
that
that
was
the
point
which
was
dispositive
of
the
issue
and
found,
prevailed
upon
two
other
judges
to
--
who'dfeel
that
we
were
correct.
but
this
isn't
in
the
conflict.
there
is
no
conflict
actually
when
you
compare
the
language
of
311
(a)
with
9
(b),
because
9
(b)
acts
directly
on
the
license.
now,
why
is
there
any
--
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
yes,
sir.
but
if
you
realize
that
section
311
(a)
has
a
dual
purpose,
then
you'll
find
that
our
construction
is
consistent
with
affording
some
purpose
to
each
of
these
acts.
section
311
(a)
doesn't
authorize,
it
doesn't
merely
cover
the
situation
of
an
activity
of
a
continuing
nature
such
as
ours.
a
grant
of
authority
may
be
made
for
one
boatload
of
lumber
from
coos
bay,
oregon
to
providence,
rhode
island.
9
(b)
has
no
relationship
to
that.
that's
not
an
activity
of
a
continuing
nature.
so
that
it's
only
when
there's
an
activity
of
a
continuing
nature
that
section
9
(b)
comes
into
effect.
consequently,
the
180-day
limitation
has
full
effect
in
every
instance,
except
where
there's
an
activity
of
a
continuing
nature.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
no,
unless
the
--
there's
reason
which
would
be
beyond
the
scope
of
the
statute.
now,
if
there
were
--
that
point
was
raised
on
the
--
on
the
brief
of
the
appellees
and
we've
covered
it
in
our
reply
brief
at
some
length.
they
claimed
that
because
the
commission
used
this
language
in
these
orders,
i
might
say
the
commission
has
always
in
the
form
of
order
their
view
is
to
extend
these
temporaries.
used
the
form
which
suggested
that
the
commission
was
doing
this
thing,
that
the
statute
wasn't.
we
differ
with
the
commission
on
that
point.
we
did
in
the
lower
court
and
we
do
here.
we
say
the
statute
--
and
i
think
the
commissioner
agrees
with
us
that
the
statute
acts
to
extend
the
temporary
authority
rather
than
the
commission.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
no,
sir.
not
--
not
without
cause.
in
other
words,
if
there
was
a
--
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
well,
now,
it
would
have
to
be
one
of
the
causes
that
--
it
couldn't
do
it,
unless
there
had
been
some
cause
that
section
9
(b)
comprehended
as
a
--
as
a
reason
for
the
commission
to
do
so.
in
other
words,
if
the
carrier
had
suspended
the
activity
and
it
--
it
was
no
longer
an
activity
of
a
continuing
nature,
then
the
commission
could
revoke
or
in
other
words,
get
out
an
order
which
is
a
public
declaration
that
there
was
no
longer
authority
to
continue
that
activity
in
a
--
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
i
understand.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
no,
sir.
you
--
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
--
see
the
--
the
statute
has
no
--
there's
no
relationship
between
the
permanent
authority
statute
and
the
temporary
authority.
temporary
authority
is
granted
for
one
set
of
statutory
purposes
and
the
permanent
for
--
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
the
commission
--
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
--
could
have
denied
it
but
not
because
there
was
any
likelihood
that
the
permanent
authority
application
would
be
denied.
that
would
have
been
an
improper
consideration.
the
commission
acts
on
a
temporary,
only
in
relation
--
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
the
--
the
public
need
for
service
--
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
the
commission
--
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
the
only
way
the
commission
could
that
would
be
to
act
immediately
upon
the
permanent
authority
application.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
that's
right.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
last
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
thank
you,
sir.
i'd
like
to
answer
a
few
of
the
questions
that
have
been
put
by
members
of
the
court.first
of
all,
mr.
justice
black
asked
what
are
the
practicalities
of
this
situation?
what
is
the
effect
of
our
decision
one
way
or
the
other?
i
think
it
should
be
clear
to
the
court,
now,
that
the
real
problem
here
or
the
real
controversy
is
--
is
a
controversy
between
the
railroads,
which
desire
to
have
a
freedom
from
competition
by
a
water
carrier
line
and
the
--
on
the
one
hand,
and
on
the
other
hand,
the
combined
interests
of
the
water
carrier
line
and
the
public
which
it
serves.
i
think
it's
an
interesting
commentary
on
that
controversy
to
realize
that
in
connection
with
these
permanent
authorities
issued
under
section
309,
referred
to
by
mr.
keenan,
that
the
railroad
opposition
is
a
meaningless
factor.
i
should
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
in
the
case
of
a.l.mechling
barge
lines
inc.,
ext.tampa,
285
i.c.c.743
and
weyerhaeusers
steamship
company,
ext.port
everglades,
which
is
doc.no.w417
sub.(1),
dated
november
15,
1956
not
reported,
which
illustrate
the
principle
that
they
are
both
from
the
commission's
decision
in
the
latter
case.
however,
notwithstanding,
a
service
by
rail,
we
have
repeatedly
found
that
shippers
in
communities
are
entitled
to
adequate
transportation
service
by
water
with
its
inherent
benefits
and
advantages
upon
proof
of
a
need,
therefore,
as
well
as
by
a
rail.
in
other
words,
this
is
an
interest
on
the
part
of
the
railroads
to
take
advantage
of
a
technicality
to
cause
a
water
carrier
service
to
be
discontinued.
now,
what
was
the
basis
upon
which
it
was
initiated?
311
(a)
permits
the
commission
to
initiate
that
service
only
on
a
finding
that
there's
an
urgent
and
immediate
need
and
no
other
carrier
services
can
meet
them.
and
that
includes
rail
service.
it
has
to
be
another
water
carrier
service
before
the
commission
can
deny
that.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
i
don't
think
it
leaned
any
way.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
yes,
sir.
i
think
it's
in
favor
of
the
water
carrier
but
more
importantly
the
shipping
public,
because
that's
the
other
side
of
the
coin
when
we
hear
the
argument
that
section
309
was
designed
to
protect
the
existing
certificate
holders
from
unneeded
new
licenses.
there's
also
the
national
transportation
policy
which
charges
the
commission
with
making
sure
there
is
an
adequate
transportation
system.
there
are
these
four
provisions
of
the
act
on
which
the
commission
can
grant
temporary
authorities,
all
designed
to
protect
the
public.
is
this
act
designed
to
protect
only
the
rail
carriers?
is
the
public
to
be
lost
of
its
interest
to
be
forgotten
completely?
is
it
to
do
without
service
from
this
time
when
a
180-day
period
runs
out,
until
the
time
when
at
the
sufferance
of
the
rail
carriers
who
as
protestants,
have
a
large
degree
of
influence
as
to
how
long
the
proceeding
takes,
to
present
(voice

--
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
that
is
exactly
the
reason
that
we
say
that
congress
in
the
administrative
procedure
act
included
such
section
9
(b)
in
the
third
sentence.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
yes,
sir.
not
that
it
isn't
legitimate
opposition.
congress
provides
in
sections
5
and
7
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
the
very
complete
procedure
to
protect
all
of
those
interests.
the
other
--
the
necessary
corollary
of
that
was
that
there
should
be
also
protection
for
the
public
and
the
license
holders.
and
that's
what
confined
in
9
(b).
it's
a
balanced
legislative
--
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
no,
sir.
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
an
application
is
filed.
then
there
must
be
a
period
of
notice.
then
this
separate
hearing
with
adequate
opportunity
--
mr.
david
g.
macdonald
the
hearing
is
completed
within
a
matter
of
days
or
weeks.
then
an
examiner
has
to
prepare
a
report
which
takes
anywhere
from
two
to
six
months.
and
exception
are
filed,
replies
to
exceptions,
a
division
report,
a
petition
for
reconsideration
to
take
it
from
a
division
of
three
commissioners
to
the
entire
commission.
this
particular
case
is
now
pending
before
the
division.
