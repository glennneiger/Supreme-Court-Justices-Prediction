was
--
who
was
--
who
sat
in
stone's
express
besides
judge
--
judge
hartigan.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
judge
ford
now,
the
reason
i
ask
is
because
judge
ford
expresses
his
independent
judgment
as
if
agreeing
with
judge
wyzanski.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
even
dissented
in
the
earlier
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
he
had
been
asked
to
report.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
i
understood
the
time
that
in
--
that
you
sought
to
bring
yourself
within
--
or
the
commission
issued
an
order
purporting
to
act
under
9
(b)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
at
the
time
you
had
a
temporary
license.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
wasn't
that
in
existence
when
the
time
was
extended?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh.
justice
felix
frankfurter
couldn't
be
that
because
it
says
a
new
--
renewal
or
a
new
license?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
didn't
you
hold
a
temporary
license
at
that
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
at
the
moment
when
you
filed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
at
the
time
before
the
180
days
expired,
you
were
the
holder
of
a
temporary
license?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
this,
mr.
--
mr.
macdonald.
they're
going
to
judge
hartigan's
opinion
in
--
in
stone's
express.
he
quote
from
the
senate
judiciary
committee
which
gave
the
explanation
of
that
and
they
referred
to
the
ohio
statute,
and
then
he
incorporates
by
reference
as
it
were
the
ohio
statute
which
says,
"the
expiration
of
a
license
held
by
said
licensee
at
the
time
said
application
was
made."
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
what
the
case
--
the
opinion
turned
on
stone?
justice
felix
frankfurter
never
mind
whether
it's
adopted.
we
just
go
to
the
print.
did
9
(b)
--
did
congress
use
the
language
of
the
ohio
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
similar
doesn't
mean
identic?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
going
to
deal
with
that
argument
on
the
merits?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
fact
that
it's
new
doesn't
make
it
irrelevant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
the
--i
suppose
and
having
looked
at
the
brief.
i
suppose
that
the
--
in
consideration
to
face
the
--
the
opportunity
that
affords
to
a
known
action
to
give
a
license,
which
eventually
may
be
denied.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
you
mean
that
if
the
commission
gives
a
temporary
license
and
fixes
it
for
100
days
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
say
there's
sufficient
ground
and
they
cannot,
i
suppose,
they
cannot
even
on
notice
say,
“we've
looked
over
these
papers
again
and
we
think
the
chances
of
granting
a
permanent
license
is
so
slim
that
we
don't
want
this
temporary
license
to
be
outstanding
even
for
100
days.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
it
could
have
denied
it
ab
initio,
i'm
assuming.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
public
interest
is
involved,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
well,
suppose
they
--
they
said
there's
public
need
and
on
reconsideration
some
other
matter
has
come
up
and
we
now
mean
that
this
would
be
redundant.
and
we
don't
want
to
deal
with
this
temporary
license
which
got
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
they
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
see.
and
deny
that
out
right
and
put
an
end
to
the
matter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
see.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mandatory
meaning
if
they
didn't
do
it
they
could
be
mandamus?
justice
felix
frankfurter
automatic,
otherwise?
justice
felix
frankfurter
practically,
there's
no
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand
mandatory
to
mean
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
i
do
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
murray,
to
--
to
know
exactly
what
it
is
citing,
in
this
case
in
fact,
the
commission
extended,
acting
as
it
concedes
its
jurisdiction
under
9
(b),
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
there
is
before
us
an
order
which
the
commission
is
defending
for
the
extended
period
and
in
this
case
we
would
not
have
to
decide
whether
that
has
to
issue
automatically
or
under
discretionary
judgment
of
the
commission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
question
of
automatic
or
mandatoriness
would
arise
only
if
the
commission
refused
to
extend
a
mandamus
to
apply.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
311
(a),
does
that
date
from
1940,
from
the
transportation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
administrative
procedure
act
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
1946.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
--
was
the
exercise
of
the
war
power
to
suspend
311
(a)
an
action
taken
by
the
executive,
by
the
--
formerly
by
the
president
at
the
request
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
the
request
to
be
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
line
of
inquiry
seems
to
be
important
because
while,
of
course,
those
were
the
war
years
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
the
commission
gave
reasons
why
this
is
generally
to
hamper
a
restriction
upon
the
administrative
process
and
the
statute
comes
in
(inaudible)
to
writing
a
general
law
when
the
administrative
procedure
act
came
into
being.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
we
any
record
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
make
any
representation
or
make
a
submission
to
the
judiciary
committee
while
the
administrative
procedure
act
was
going
through
the
legislative
mill?
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
this
--
did
this
provision
9
(b)
emanate
like
a
--
preside
in
the
original
bill
which
went
before
the
congress?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
may
i
ask
one
more
question.
the
administrative
procedure
act
that
caused
flow
to
ground
or
to
run
back
through
in
it's
origin
to
the
report
of
the
accessing
committee
versus
administrative
committee.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
--
was
there
any
discussion
of
this
question?
because
this
is
a
general
provision.
it
applies
it
to
all
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
discussion
in
the
particular
report
on
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
or
the
federal
power
commission,
or
any
of
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
they
should
be
more
flexibility?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
you,
and
you,
of
course
will
come
to
the
practice
of
the
commission
or
commissions,
the
administrative
practice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
since
--
yes,
since
1946.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
only
of
your
commission
but
of
the
others.
have
we
got
any
light
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
telling
us
what
the
order
of
volume
of
--
of
certificates
that
would
come
within
the
sweep
of
this
provision,
of
9
(b)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
412?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
also
give
figures
to
indicate
how
long
after
the
extension,
after
the
expiration
of
180
days
disposition
was
made
on
the
merits
of
the
permanent
--
of
the
application
for
the
permanent
license?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
there's
one
more
thing
that
i'm
not
clear
about
that
may
make
a
difference
between
you
and
mr.
macdonald.
in
this
--
in
this
extension
as
i
(inaudible)
these
claims
to
be
allowed
under
9
(b),
does
the
commission
fix
the
period
of
the
extension?
justice
felix
frankfurter
until?
until.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
these
figures
that
you've
just
given
us
are
--
are
what
the
periods
amounted
to
in
fact,
is
that
right?
this
railroad.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
there
is
no
--
the
commission
doesn't
say
180
days
have
expired.
we'll
let
this
license
run
for
three
more
months.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
started
to
tell
us
about
the
reports
by
the
commission
from
year
to
year
and
its
annual
report
to
congress
of
the
extensions
it
has
purported
to
make
under
9
(b).
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
inference
do
you
draw
from
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
congress
was
surprised
to
what
it
was
doing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
that's
all.
this
isn't
the
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
weston,
how
many
applications
for
the
temporary
licenses
are
made
and
of
those
how
many
are
granted?
roughly,
what
are
the
figures?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
--
you
don't
know
what
the
basis?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
missed
what
you
said,
where
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
were
the
a
renewal
or
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
considerations
of
policy
that
you
advance
seem
to
be
equally
operating.
if
the
license
is
given
for
three
years,
it's
a
matter
of
public
interest.
and
you
have
to
get
permission
to
have
it
renewed.
let
it
run
before
passing
on
the
application
for
renewal
maybe
just
as
much
of
an
inroad,
or
a
handout,
or
whatever
you
call
it
of
a
public
interest
which
is
found
subsequently
against
the
license.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
surprise
me
because
as
i
read
the
opinion,
particularly
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
this
district,
that's
--
your
problem
comes
up
again
and
again.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
but
it's
contested
and
people
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
particularly
in
the
field
where
there's
a
change,
inconsiderable
change.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
but
i
--
it
seems
that
in
a
way,
to
allow
a
license
that
has
been
enjoyed
for
three
years,
run
on
until
you
--
the
commission
gets
around
to
decide
it
is
replete
with
--
with
potential
dangers
to
the
public
interest.
that
a
greater
way
you
haven't
got
a
license,
you
haven't
got
--
you
really
have
a
temporary
thing
before
you
decide
why
you
should
have
anything.
if
you're
going
to
argue
apart
from
the
language
of
and
the
relationship
of
the
two
statutes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
get
a
license
for
three
years
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
then
it
can
go
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
the
renewal
isn't
automatic
but
as
to
satisfy
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
certain
standards.
you've
had
three
years
of
enjoyment,
then
to
let
it
run
on,
when
eventually
it
may
be
denied,
is
taking
more
away
from
the
public
interest
as
it
were,
than
it
concededly
starts
out
with
being
an
emergency
and
you
haven't
got
anything
to
start
with.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
very
important
condition
was
that
it
should
terminate
at
the
end
of
three
years.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
may
get
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
may
get
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wonder
--
i'm
just
--
just
curious
to
know
whether
your
--
your
more
informed
knowledge
or
my
guess
is
more
correct,
namely,
that
these
licenses
become
almost
automatically
renewed.
that
is
not
my
impression
or
i
maybe
all
wrong
as
to
any
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
mr.
weston,
the
drastic
changes
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
made
in
the
immigration
law
so
that
congress
had
to
change
it
means
to
me
to
be
a
rather
minimizing
way
to
speak
of
it
as
you
just
have.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
--
what
are
these
for
procedures?
justice
felix
frankfurter
only
the
--
to
answer
yes
to
that
question
presupposes
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
is
going
to
be
derelict
of
the
public
duty
and
under
the
guise
of
not
having
completed
an
application
for
a
license
just
defeats
the
purpose
of
the
statute
by
--
by
letting
it
run
on
forever.
that's
what
the
answer
implies.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
otherwise
it
can't
run
on
forever.
and
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
for
years.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
is
an
interim
thing.
i
mean
if
--
if
the
commission
really,
i
quite
agree
that
the
mere
fact
that
one
previously,
conscientious
discharge
of
duty
to
an
agency,
isn't
the
answer.
it
doesn't
tell
you
how
to
construe
it.
it's
part
of
the
way
of
considering.
but
you
must
take
it
into
account.
but
i
don't
think
you
can
assume
that
thereby
they
let
an
application
run
for
--
on
forever
under
an
emergency
application.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
is
to
construe
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
certainly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
an
emergency.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
an
emergency.
justice
felix
frankfurter
immediate
and
urgent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
i
don't
quite
(inaudible)
the
--
the
controversy
is
really
about
the
gap
of
time
between
180
days
and
whatever
time
it
is
that
the
commission
gets
around
disposing
of
the
application
for
a
permanent
license.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
whatever
it
is.
i
thought
the
figures
we
had
indicated
quantitatively
which
is
where
one
is
likely
is
going
to
get
access
a
very
different
story.
you
may
just
have
made,
the
fact
that
you
have
two
or
three
years,
i
should
think
we
would
call
for
a
must
--
must
have
a
very
special
situation,
must
represent
a
very
special
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
norm,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there's
also
--
but
there's
also
the
interest
of
the
shippers
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
relied
on
that
since.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
now,
would
you
be
good
enough
to
point
to
any
word
that
convey
that
complicated
idea.
any
words
or
called
cases
of
words.
after
all
we
are
construing
something
that's
before
us
as
a
commanding
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
do
we
know
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
we
know
what
the
ohio
--
how
the
ohio
statute
--
i
know
in
my
own
state
of
new
york
you
can't
find
out
that
the
legislative
history
or
piece
of
legislation
is
--
it's
a
secret
you
can't
get
access
to.
what
about,
have
we
got
legislative
journals
so
we
know
what
that
ohio
statute
--
have
we
got
decisions
what
that
meant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
legislative
history
of
another
state
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
is
referred
to
obliquely
in
a
report
of
congress.
this
is
certainly
our
inference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
the
statute
was
placed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
statute
still
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
claimed
here?
you
have
to
go
to
the
ohio
statute
and
i
don't
know.
for
all
i
know
the
ohio
statute
might
have
been
construed
to
cover
the
same
kind
of
service
rather
than
the
same
kind
of
piece
of
paper.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suggest
to
the
opposite
that
all
questions
of
statutory
construction
are
technicalities.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
wonder
if
i
missed
your
argument.
but
nobody
would
dream
of
asking
further
issue
again
if
there's
in
view
of
the
commission's
view
that
9
(b)
takes
care
of
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
keenan,
may
i
trouble
you
to
tell
me
what
in
your
view,
what
situation
is
contemplated
or
is
referred
to
by
the
last
of
the
third
sentence,
"in
any
case
in
which
the
licensee
had
in
accordance
with
agency
rules,
made
timely
and
sufficient
applications
for
a
--
that
we
skip
--
a
new
license"?
justice
felix
frankfurter
"no
license
or
reference
to
any
activity
of
a
continuing
nature
shall
expire",
what
does
that
refer
to?
what's
the
relation
of
the
new
license
to
what
is
outstanding?
what
is
outstanding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
in
evidently
something
different
from
a
renewal
of
the
existing
license?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
must
be
that.
it
says
a
renewal
or
a
new
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is,
what
the
connection
is
between
an
outstanding
license
which
is
different
from
something
that
it'd
ask
and
it
denominated
a
new
license.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
scope
you
give
to
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
it
doesn't
relate
to
an
outstanding
emergency
or
a
temporary
license?
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
right
in
recalling
that
the
reiss
case
partly
involved
a
dislocation
of
practice
of
what
was
there
before
the
practice
of
the
commission
on
the
basis
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
but
it
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
very
act
--
this
very
act
cut
into
what
was
deemed
to
be
and
argued
before
us
has
a
very
specific
mode
of
going
--
of
doing
business
before
the
commission
and
we
said
no.
the
administrative
procedure
act
applies
to
situations
there
just
as
we
made
no
drastic
changes
in
regard
to
the
immigration
service
and
in
both
cases
--
well,
i
don't
know
whether
in
the
case
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
would
change.
it
was
changed
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
administrative
procedure
act
wasn't
just
a
codification.
it
was
the
opposite
of
a
codification
of
what
had
been
prevailing
as
administrative
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
don't
merely
think
that
there
is
any
atmosphere
of
undue
--
of
one
of
due
process
in
construing
9
(b)
the
way
that's
--
by
that
field.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
between
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
an
overflow
of
a
--
of
a
new
answer,
one
of
due
process.
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
least,
my
figures.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
do
you
say
that
ought
to
be
cut
close?
it
ought
to
be
sharply
restricted
and
not
liberally
extended.
only
if
you're
arguing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
stone
case,
which
is
rendered
moot
by
the
disposition
of
the
permanent
license.
i
would
assume
that
the
decision
of
the
district
court
but
the
case
got
here.
it
was
far
beyond
appeal
and
then
there
was
a
suggestion
of
mootness
to
which
we
yielded
and
to
which
we
accepted.
of
course,
in
this
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
commission
tomorrow,
if
it
rendered
this
moot,
by
granting
the
permanent
injunction
of
the
permanent
application.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
on
your
theory,
after
180
days,
the
temporary
license
came
to
an
end,
some
other
applicant
could
come
in.
they
could
grant
him
a
temporary
license
for
180
days.
at
the
end
of
that
period
that
would
expire.
you
would
have
had
two
or
three
successive
temporary
licensees.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
eventually
--
and
eventually
the
first
applicant
would
get
the
permanent
license.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
got
any
to
lie
down
to
this
statistic
that
i
--
in
which
i
have
some
interest,
the
relation
between
temporary
licenses
granted
and
the
total
number
of
applications?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
not
just
the
(inaudible)
which
probably
supply
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
there
be
approximately,
the
2000,
that
they
granted
as
a
matter
of
course,
would
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
did
you
know
as
a
matter
of
--
all
right
then.
i
thought
you
had
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
as
you
suggest
indicated
because
some
other
temporary
licensee
come
in.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
have
been
some
suggestions
that
the
commission
give
excessive
attention
to
the
rail
interest
in
the
--
in
the
entire
transportation
needs
of
the
country.
and
this
case,
it
leaned
in
favor
of
the
water
carrier,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
its
the
decision
was
in
favor
of
the
water
carrier
as
an
expression
of
the
national
need.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
a
correct
statement?
