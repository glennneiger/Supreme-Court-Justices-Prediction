mr.
william
q.
keenan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
q.
keenan
that's
correct.
mr.
william
q.
keenan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
william
keenan
and
i
represent
the
appellees
here
and
the
plaintiffs
who
as,
mr.
macdonald,
points
out
were
somewhat
successful
below.
at
the
outset,
in
our
discussion
of
this
matter,
i
should
like
to
make
sure
that
the
court
and
i
have
in
mind
the
same
basic
facts
in
the
case.
there
were
two
material
applications
filed
before
the
administrative
agency
involved
here,
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
the
first
one
was
filed
may
5th,
1955.
it
sought
a
so-called
temporary
authority
from
the
commission
and
was
addressed
to
the
commission's
power
to
grant
such
relief
under
section
311
(a)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
it
is
useful
and
i
respectfully
suggest
important
to
bear
in
mind
the
language
of
section
311
(a)
of
the
act.
it
empowers
the
commission
to
grant
such
temporary
authority
without
--
without
hearings
or
other
proceedings,
in
the
event
that
there
is
an
urgent
and
immediate
need
for
the
service
thus
to
be
rendered.
approximately
three
days
later,
as
mr.
macdonald
has
advised
the
court,
although
it
is
not
a
matter
of
record,
i
believe
that
it's
correct.
approximately
three
days
later
on
may
8th,
pan-atlantic,
the
applicant
carrier
before
the
commission
filed
another
application
for
commission
relief.
this
was
for
a
so-called
permanent
intercoastal
certificate.
the
same
type
of
carriage
sought
to
be
authorized
by
the
prior
application
for
a
temporary
certificate.
however,
there
was
an
important,
a
very
important
distinction
between
these
two
applications.
the
first
one
as
i
have
said
was
addressed
to
the
commission's
power
under
section
311
(a)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
the
second
one
was
addressed
to
the
commission's
power
under
section
309
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
those
sections
differed
in
respects
that
are
important
to
the
decision
now
before
this
court.
section
309
empowered
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
issue
a
license
or
a
certificate
which
is
permanent.
it's
permanent
in
the
sense
that
this
court
has
held
in
the
seatrain
case,
seatrain
against
the
united
states.
that
it
is,
at
least,
in
some
circumstances,
any
way
beyond
the
power
of
the
commission
to
revoke
that
certificate.
it
is,
i
think,
true
without
a
doubt
in
the
whole
wide
world
that
the
commission
has
every
power
in
the
world
to
revoke
a
temporary
certificate
which
is
issuable
entirely
within
the
commission's
discretion
under
section
311
(a)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
therefore,
the
first
important
difference
between
these
two
applications
and
the
two
types
of
relief
sought
from
the
commission
to
be
noted
is
the
permanent
and
the
irrevocable
nature
of
the
second
certificate
sought
on
may
8th,
1955.
and
the
temporary,
and
i
contend,
revocable
nature
of
the
certificate
sought
--
the
license
sought
and
granted
by
the
application
of
may
5th.
mr.
william
q.
keenan
that
--
that
is
correct,
if
your
honor
please,
and
--
mr.
william
q.
keenan
that
is
correct,
if
your
--
i
--
i
understand
my
brother
to
make
that
--
to
make
that
contention.
i
think
i
can
best
address
myself
to
it
if
i
may
be
given
an
opportunity
to
develop
the
argument
a
little
further.
mr.
william
q.
keenan
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
my
understanding
that
it
is
and
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
it
would
be
otherwise.
mr.
william
q.
keenan
i
can't
advice
your
honor
of
my
knowledge.
i
can
only
make
the
same
guess
that
i
think,
your
honor,
will
make
that
such
has
been
the
case.
i'd
feel
substantially
--
mr.
william
q.
keenan
i'd
feel
substantially,
too,
that's
--
a
certain
that
that
is
true
but
i
--
i
can't
say
that
i've
researched
the
fact
concerning
the
commission's
habits
of
regulation.
now,
the
next
event
that
occurred,
which
is
of
importance
after
the
may
8th
application
for
permanent
certificate,
was
an
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
granting
the
temporary
certificate
sought
on
--
on
may
18th,
i
believe.
some
13
days
--
some
13
days
after
the
application
for
temporary
authority
had
been
filed.
now,
that
was
a
grant
of
authority
until
sometime
in
november.
i
believe
november
14,
1955.
it
was
a
grant
of
intercoastal
authority
for
the
six-month
period
contemplated
by
section
311
(a)
of
the
act.
it
was
a
temporary
license.
it
granted
a
temporary
privilege.
the
only
other
event
that
is
important
or
indeed
even
relevant
to
a
decision
of
this
case
which
thereafter
occurred
was
sometime
in
october
of
1955.
i
believe
october
22nd,
1955,
when
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
whatever
reason,
if
the
court
please,
issued
an
order
or
you
might
call
it
indeed
an
editorial
comment
upon
the
law,
reciting
the
fact
that
until
the
determination
of
this
permanent
authority
proceeding,
the
applicant,
pan-atlantic,
would
continue
to
have
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
license
and
permission
to
carry
intercoastally.
mr.
william
q.
keenan
to
force
the
commission,
if
your
honor
please?
mr.
william
q.
keenan
none
that
occurs
to
me
right
at
this
moment,
your
honor.
possibly
if
some
such
remedy
is
available,
i
don't
know
of
one.
mr.
william
q.
keenan
it's
a
fact.
mr.
william
q.
keenan
i
--
i
understand
your
honor's
question.
i
said
that
(voice
overlap)
just
to
repeat
it.
mr.
william
q.
keenan
your
honor,
no.
it
would
make
no
difference
in
the
position
i
would
adopt
concerning
the
merits
of
this
case.
i
think
it
would
make
my
position
a
little
weaker.
in
other
words
--
mr.
william
q.
keenan
i
don't
enjoy
--
what
--
excuse
me?
mr.
william
q.
keenan
in
other
words,
i
--
i
don't
entirely
join
my
colleague
and
i
don't
subscribe
to
the
view.
well,
perhaps,
i
misunderstand
him
i
think
mr.
justice
frankfurter
suggested
that
if
this
is
a
matter
of
technicality
as
to
which
came
first
--
mr.
william
q.
keenan
i
was
glad
to
hear
your
honor
say
that
afterwards.
and
i
understood
it
and
remember
it.
thank
you.
mr.
william
q.
keenan
no,
your
honor.
that
is
not
entirely
correct.
the
application
for
the
permanent
certificate
was
to
carry
between
some
30
or
35
ports
on
the
two
coasts
of
the
united
states.
and
the
application
for
temporary
certificate
was
to
carry
between
some
seven
or
eight
ports
on
the
two
coasts
of
the
united
states.
it
is
however,
true,
the
record
notwithstanding,
to
the
contrary,
that
the
application
for
the
permanent
certificate
included
service
to
and
from
every
port
sought
to
be
served
by
the
application
for
the
temporary
certificate.
mr.
william
q.
keenan
now,
the
record
does
not
reflect
what
service
was
rendered
by
the
applicant
as
the
result
of
receiving
the
temporary
license.
it
only
indicates
that
sufficient
service
was
rendered
as
to
create
damage
and
competitive
harm
to
the
plaintiffs
below
and
the
appellees
here.
mr.
william
q.
keenan
no,
your
honor,
that
would
not
be
correct.
the
defendants
--
the
intervening
defendants
and
i
believe
indeed
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
which,
of
course,
was
also
an
intervening
defendant,
requested
a
stay
of
judgment
and
plaintiffs
decided
to
that
stay
in
view
of
the
fact
that
a
similar
such
stay
had
been
granted
in
the
stone's
express
case
which
was
a
precedent
for
this
litigation.
i
had
been
stating
that
the
next
important
event
which
occurred,
which
was
important
or
--
or
which
is
relevant
to
this
litigation
was
the
granting
by
the
--
or
--
or
rather
by
the
--
at
issuance
of
a
statement,
or
order
as
you
may
choose
to
call
it,
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
advising
pan-atlantic
and
the
public
that
intercoastal
carriage
might
continue
during
the
pendency
of
the
permanent
authority
application.
what
i
should
like
to
urge
strongly
is
that
there
has
never
been
filed
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
a
fortiori.
there
has
never
issued
from
the
interstate
commerce
commission
an
application
for
a
subsequent
section
311
(a)
temporary
authority.
the
court
has
inquired
whether
it
would
be
within
the
power
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
grant
such
a
subsequent
180-day
temporary
license.
i
doubt
it,
but
i
don't
think
it's
material
to
this
case
because
no
such
license
has
ever
been
issued.
mr.
william
q.
keenan
i
believe
your
honor
is
correct.
but
what
i
should
like
to
urge
when
we
attempt
to
evaluate
and
understand
the
effect
of
section
9
(b)'s
third
sentence
on
section
311
(a)
that
there
has
been
issued
no
renewal
license
or
indeed
there
has
been
applied
for
no
renewal
license
under
section
311
(a)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
i
don't
think
i
should
take
the
time
during
the
argument
now
to
go
into
the
matter
in
detail.
but
my
--
my
brother
for
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
advised
the
court
that
the
civil
aeronautics
board
interprets
section
9
(b)
of
the
act
consistently
with
the
interpretation
given
it
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
if
the
court
in
reviewing
this
matter
will
be
so
good
as
to
refer
to
the
section
of
the
code
of
federal
regulations
cited
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
its
brief
for
that
proposition,
namely
title
14,
code
of
federal
regulations,
part
290
and
the
applicable
or
the
pertinent
section
is
section
290.1
(d).
the
court
will
note
that
the
civil
aeronautics
board
thinks
of
a
renewal
application
to
which
section
9
(b)
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
is
applicable
to
be
an
application
for
a
subsequent
exemption
license
under
section
416
(b),
i
believe
it
is,
of
the
civil
aeronautics
act
and
does
not
think
of
the
so-called
renewal
application
as
being
an
application
for
a
permanent
certificate
under
the
civil
aeronautics
act.
no
more
in
the
case
at
bar
should
section
9
(b)
be,
be
thought
of
as
relevant
to
an
application
for
a
permanent
certificate.
and
it
should
not
be
considered
as
preserving
from
expiration
the
temporary
privilege
to
carry
intercoastally
during
the
pendency
of
an
application
for
a
permanent
certificate.
if
at
all,
it
has
applicability
to
section
311
(a)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
it
would
have
such
applicability
only
during
the
pendency
of
a
subsequent
application
for
another
section
311
(a)
license.
in
other
words,
another
license
limited
--
and
limited
in
time
to
a
duration
of
180
days.
mr.
william
q.
keenan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
q.
keenan
the
--
in
my
view
and
the
position
of
the
plaintiff-appellees
here
is
that
such
a
new
license
is
one
that
bears
a
relationship
to
the
--
to
the
license
which
exists
and
gives
the
licensee
his
status
as
licensee.
mr.
william
q.
keenan
i
think
i'm
inclined
to
agree
with
your
honor.
mr.
william
q.
keenan
or
--
or
a
new
license.
mr.
william
q.
keenan
what
the
connection
should
be
under
the
statute
is
probably
interpreted.
mr.
william
q.
keenan
yes.
mr.
william
q.
keenan
yes.
the
scope
that
we
urge,
that
the
court
give
to
it
is
that
the
new
license
be
required
to
be
one
of
the
same
type
or
class
of
the
existing
license.
we
do
not
urge
that
on
the
basis
that
on
--
on
the
ground
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
in
some
sort
of
a
way
adopted
or
incorporated
by
reference
in
section
9
(b)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
the
language
of
an
ohio
administrative
procedure
act.
we
do
urge
it
because
that
is
the
only
construction
of
section
9
(b)
which
makes
sense
in
the
light
of
the
practical
realities
of
the
situation
concerning
which
the
chief
justice
questioned
counsel
just
now.
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
do
so,
i
should
like
to
discuss
those
practical
realities.
the
underlying
statutory
purpose
which
is
involved
here,
it
expressed
not
in
section
9
(b)
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
or
indeed
in
section
311
(a)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
i
suggest
that
it
is
to
be
found
in
section
309
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
which
includes
the
words,
"no
carrier
shall
engage
in
transportation
subject
to
this
part."
those
are
the
words
which
are
customarily
used
in
beginning
a
licensing
enabling
statute.
in
other
words,
the
legislature
creates
an
area
of
prohibition
and
then
empowers
an
agency
to
lift
that
prohibition
by
granting
a
privilege
to
a
licensee
to
act
within
that
area.
now,
often
the
standards
which
are
required
of
licensees
in
these
licensing
enabling
situations
are
simply
standards
of
fitness.
you
don't
like
an
optometrist,
or
a
doctor,
or
a
dentist
operating
in
your
town
if
you
--
if
he
isn't
reasonably
confident.
that's
not
the
sole
standard
required
of
a
licensee
under
the
interstate
commerce
act.
in
order
to
understand
this,
at
least
let
me
tell
the
court
that
in
order
for
me
to
understand
this,
it
was
helpful
for
me
to
remember
that
the
interstate
commerce
act
requires
the
transportation
industry
to
depart
from
the
principles,
and
functions,
and
effects
at
least
partially,
of
the
free
market.
the
function
of
a
free
market
with
regard
to
any
nterprise
is
to
keep
inefficient
enterprises
from
entering
into
the
market.
and
to
some
extent
to
winnow
out
enterprises
when
they
become
inefficient.
and
finally
to
discourage
anybody,
inefficient
or
efficient,
from
entering
into
an
overcrowded
market.
and
this
is,
of
course,
a
very
good
thing
because
it
is
wasteful
of
national
income,
should
anybody
enter
into
an
overcrowded
market.
by
an
overcrowded
market
i
mean,
of
course,
a
market
where
there
are
already
more
than
--
than
enough
people
to
take
care
of
all
the
business
available.
we
have
in
this
country
with
regard
to
the
transportation
industry,
at
least
the
rail
motor
carrier
and
water
carrier
transportation
industry,
departed
from
the
regulatory
function
of
that
free
market
and
we
have
assigned
that
regulatory
function
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
section
309
posits
another
requirement
besides
fitness
for
a
licensee
to
get
a
license,
and
that
is,
that
the
service
sought
to
be
provided
be
required
by
the
public
convenience
and
necessity.
a
clue
to
what
is
meant
by
public
convenience
and
necessity
can
be
found
in
a
statement
of
the
national
transportation
policy,
which
begins
the
interstate
commerce
act.
and
if
we
were
to
take
the
time
which
is
not,
unfortunately,
available
to
be
anymore
today
to
compare
what
i
have
just
suggested
are
the
functions
of
the
free
market
and
to
compare
the
criteria
set
up
for
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
exercising
its
licensing
function,
we
would
find
a
very,
in
my
view
anyway,
happy
coincidence
between
the
two.
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
short
has
the
function
of
regulating
the
transportation
industry
market
so
that
inefficient
industries
don't
enter
it.
so
that
inefficient
industries,
to
some
extent,
anyway,
are
discouraged
from
remaining
in
it
and
so
that
those
who
are
in
it
already
and
who
are
operating
efficiently
will
not
be
rendered
inefficient
by
unnecessary
inclusions
on
the
market
when
it
is
already
over
served.
if
the
interstate
commerce
commission
is
to
perform
this
guiding
function
i
lieu
of
the
free
market,
it
must
obtain
information
concerning
what
the
conditions
are
in
the
industry
which
it
regulates.
it
must
find
out
what
the
current
technology
of
the
industry
is.
it
must
find
out
what
the
technology
of
the
users
of
transportation
is.
it
must
find
out
what
the
cost
of
capital
is
at
a
given
time.
it
must
find
out
how
readily
people
already
in
the
transportation
market
can
expand
their
enterprises
to
meet
new
and
growing
needs.
therefore,
when
someone
comes
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
asks
permission
to
violate
the
prohibition
in
section
309,
namely,
that
no
one
shall
engage
in
transportation
subject
to
this
part
ask,
therefore,
privilege
to
enter
into
the
market.
the
commission
must
find
out
what
the
conditions
are
in
the
market
in
order
to
make
sure
that
its
entry
there
will
not
create
a
great
deal
of
damage.
a
major
and
reasonable
source
of
information
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
when
it
enters
upon
this
endeavor
is
the
people
already
in
the
--
in
the
market
involved.
in
other
words,
the
competitors
of
the
applicant
are
forced,
however,
they
have
interest
hostile
to
the
applicant.
therefore,
in
the
customary
way
by
which
tribunals
in
the
--
in
the
united
states
get
information
from
people
who's
interests
conflict
and
who
are
hostile
to
each
other,
there
are
provisions
for
adversary
proceedings,
which
in
the
view
of
this
court,
at
least
insofar
as
the
profession
has
--
has
understood
this
court's
position
in
reis
against
the
united
states
in
proceedings
which
must
meet
some
elements
of
due
process.
due
process
is
--
is,
of
course,
nothing
but
a
--
a
way
by
which
a
tribunal
can
--
can
be
assisted
in
reaching
the
truth
when
it's
relying
on
adversary
procedures
to
--
to
obtain
information.
now
--
mr.
william
q.
keenan
i'm
advised
by
my
colleague
that
your
honor
is
right
and
i
must
confess
that
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
william
q.
keenan
i
--
i
certainly
take
--
mr.
william
q.
keenan
well
--
mr.
william
q.
keenan
i
agree
with
your
honor.
in
--
in
at
least,
insofar
as
the
--
as
--
as
the
gathering
of
information
in
the
--
in
the
manner
i've
--
i've
described,
however,
is
concerned,
i
think
--
i
--
i
don't
think
that
many
people
doubt
that
some
elements
of
due
process
must
be
met
at
least
for
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and,
of
course,
the
certification
proceedings.
if
that
is
a
proposition
in
question,
why,
people
will
be
very
interested
to
learn
a
bit.
mr.
william
q.
keenan
oh,
your
honor
--
mr.
william
q.
keenan
i
--
i
don't
suggest
that
for
a
moment.
and
judge
wyzanski
--
mr.
william
q.
keenan
i
know
judge
wyzanski
--
mr.
william
q.
keenan
they're
very
solicitous
of
--
of
a
due
process,
of
course.
now,
what
i
--
what
i
do
need
to
suggest,
if
your
honor
please,
is
that
the
--
that
the
commission
decided
that
the
question
concerning
the
temporary
certificate
below,
not
on
the
basis
of
evidence
introduced
through
witnesses,
not
on
the
basis
of
documentary
evidence,
not
that
the
--
the
privilege
of
adducing
evidence
before
the
commission
was
not
accompanied
by
the
liability
to
cross
examination,
which
is
customary,
not
on
a
constitutional
basis
at
all.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
q.
keenan
oh,
if
your
honor
--
your
honor,
i'm
suggesting
that
it
is
impossible
for
the
interstate
commerce
commission
intelligently
to
--
to
determine
who
should
get
a
permanent
certificate
to
enter
upon
it
the
market.
unless
the
commission
has
the
benefit
of
advice
which
is
given
it
under
the
safeguards
of
section
5
and
7
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
and
no
such
safeguards,
of
course,
i
think
that
everyone
is
in
agreement.
no
such
safeguards
were
attended
upon
the
--
the
commission's
receipt
of
advice
from
the
applicant
when
it
granted
the
temporary
application
in
the
case
at
bar.
now,
a
significant
--
that
the
--
i
don't
mean
to
say
significant,
a
major
portion
of
the
appellee's
brief
is
devoted
to
really
what
was
for
the
--
the
writer
of
painstaking
this
effort
to
--
to
discuss
the
damage
which
can
be
done
by
the
improvident
entry
of
an
enterprise
into
a
controlled
market.
and
it's
--
it's
devoted
to
showing
how
that
damage
can
be
done
even
if
the
enterprise
is
in
the
market
only
for
a
year
or
two
years.
in
the
case
at
bar,
a
water
carrier
of
the
size
and
with
the
capacity
to
carry,
that
pan-atlantic
has,
of
course,
it's
going
to
produce
rather
profound
changes
on
the
patterns
of
transcontinental
and
intercoastal
transportation
if
it
operates
for
one
year
or
two
years
in
point
of
fact,
if
the
court
please,
it
has
had
its
license
for
22
months.
now
--
mr.
william
q.
keenan
oh,
what
--
i
--
i
would
suppose
quite
to
the
contrary,
your
honor.
i
would
suppose,
and
although,
i
don't
know
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
expedited
the
--
the
progressing
of
the
--
of
the
permanent
--
mr.
william
q.
keenan
well,
it's
about
22
months
that
pan-atlantic
has
had
its
intercoastal
temporary
authority.
and
i
suppose
that
means
that
the
permanent
application
has
been
pending
that
long.
almost
two
years.
and
it's
a
reasonable
prospect
in
this
particular
intercoastal
proceeding.
i
should
eventually
give
the
court
my
opinion
as
an
attorney
associated
with
the
litigation
that
it
will
continue
for
another
year.
maybe
another
year
and
a
half
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
q.
keenan
many
times
i
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
i
wouldn't
suggest
for
a
moment
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
can
complete
many
of
these
licensing
applications
within
the
six
months,
that's
spoken
of
in
section
311
(a)
of
the
act.
mr.
william
q.
keenan
well,
it
has
in
point
of
fact
in
the
past.
now,
whether
--
mr.
william
q.
keenan
i
think
--
mr.
william
q.
keenan
for
indeed,
your
honor.
mr.
william
q.
keenan
it's
a
possibility.
but
what
i
should
like
to
have
--
mr.
william
q.
keenan
that
is
a
possibility.
what
i
should
like
to
emphasize
in
my
closing
moments,
if
the
court
please,
is
that
the
two
licenses
involved
issued
by
different
procedures.
and
that
that
is
a
governing
consideration.
one
issue's
not
entirely
by
an
ex
parte
procedure.
of
course,
we
had
a
chance
to
be
heard
in
the
sense
that
we
had
a
chance
to
file
a
paper.
it
did
not
issue
as
a
result
of
the
exhaustive
type
of
examination
which
the
court,
i'm
sure,
was
familiar
with.
mr.
william
q.
keenan
i
can
shed
--
mr.
william
q.
keenan
i
can
shed
no
light
on
that,
if
your
honor
please.
i
--
i
--
it
would
probably
be
difficult.
i
doubt
the
commission
itself
has
kept
count
of
the
number
of
applications
for
--
for
temporary
license.
mr.
william
q.
keenan
i
--
i
don't
think
i
should
attempt
to
--
to
characterize
the
way
the
interstate
commerce
commission
grant
--
grants
the
--
mr.
william
q.
keenan
no,
i'm
afraid
i
can't,
your
honor.
well,
as
i
say,
the
important
difference
between
the
two
of
them
are
addressed
now
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
the
difference
between
these
two
licenses
which
is
material
to
section
9
(b)
is
the
procedure
by
which
they
issue
in
the
first
place.
and
the
fact
that
one
is
an
irrevocable
--
irrevocable
under
the
seatrain
case
that
--
relatively
speaking
anyway.
and
the
other
is
a
very,
very
temporary
one.
therefore,
they
have
quite
different
effects
on
the
market.
one
is
an
emergency
license.
and
the
other
one
is
--
is
issued,
to
me,
an
abiding
permanent
need.
the
pendency
of
an
application
for
a
license
to
meet
an
abiding
permanent
need
is
no
reason,
whatsoever,
to
preserve
from
expiration
a
license
which
was
brought
into
existence
only
to
meet
a
one
spot
emergency,
at
the
end
of
which
emergency,
the
ordinary
mechanisms
of
the
transportation
market
will
take
care
of
the
public
need.
mr.
william
q.
keenan
that's
also
true,
your
honor.
mr.
william
q.
keenan
may
i
thank
the
court
for
its
attention.
