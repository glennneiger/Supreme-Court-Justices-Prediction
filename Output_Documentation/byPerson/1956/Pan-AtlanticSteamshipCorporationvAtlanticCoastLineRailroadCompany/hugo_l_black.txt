did
the
commission
extend
beyond
180
days
on
its
own
motion
or
through
application?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
the
permanent
license?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
--
how
would
it
result
in
abuse?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
as
a
matter
of
practical
consequences,
what
are
the
evils
that
you
foresee
in
connection
with
the
--
with
the
--
i
recall
that
in
seatrain
case
that
we
had,
which
you
referred,
was
one
in
which
we
held
--
we
held
the
commission
pretty
close
to
its
right
to
revoke
in
order
to
preserve
the
rights
of
licensee.
i
thought
that
was
the
issue
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
happen
if
--
if
the
180
days
expired
and
a
new
application
was
filed
by
the
same
company
or
some
other
company
for
a
temporary
application
to
do
the
service?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
have
to
be
implied.
is
there
any
such
provision
--
is
that
in
the
act
that
they
cannot
issue
another
temporary
certificate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
it
can
go
through
the
former
application
and
proof?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
your
argument
appears
to
me
to
be
based
on
the
premise
that
this
is
pretty
bad
or
something,
and
here
the
evil
is
that
some
wrong
that
you
seem
to
foresee,
that
might
occur
to
the
public
or
to
the
--
some
of
the
other
carriers.
but
am
i
wrong
in
that?
there's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
before
you
have
more
competition?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
gives
to
me
a
question
of,
duly
from
your
stand
point
of
the
interpretation
of
language
doesn't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
never
--
i'm
asking
you
the
question
because
you've
given
some
of
the
legislative
history.
you've
not
yet
given
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
i've
heard
that
indicates
there
was
some
reason
why
congress
would
want
to
be
extraordinaire
--
extraordinary
solicitors
about
repeating
the
bill,
the
bill
as
a
whole,
seems
to
be
in
the
direction
of
protecting
rights
that
have
been
granted
and
which
might
not
to
be
carried
on
to
the
interest
of
the
public.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
now
that
my
interest
is,
they're
just
wrong
with
that.
what
i
see
is
the
situation
where
they
provide
for
licenses
which
you
might
permit,
whatever
you
want
to
call
them,
which
might
be
considered
of
a
temporary
nature
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
there's
pending
in
that
time
an
application
for
a
permanent
permit.
now,
i
--
i
assume
that
it
might
be
impossible
for
the
commission
always
to
be
able
to
get
through
180
days.
and
there
is
a
--
a
pretty
big
problem
they
have
of
--
of
interrupting
a
carriage
that
might
be
--
it
results
in
tremendous
loss
to
the
person
who
later
on
might
be
able
to
get
a
permanent
license.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that
--
that
doesn't
really
permit
the
claims
wouldn't
it?
if
you're
going
to
say
there,
that
new
carrier
would
--
haven't
got
a
temporary
authority.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
other
man
has
working
that
out.
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
anyone
else
supplied
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
this
according
to
you
as
between
applicants?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
any
way
--
would
there
be
any
way
for
you
--
for
your
clients
who
are
interested
in
that
to
force
a
speedier
action
by
the
commission
in
connection
with
the
permanent
application?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
suppose
--
i
--
i'm
assuming
they
wouldn't
do
it.
but
suppose
they
decided
to
hold
it
off
(inaudible)
idea.
would
there
be
any
way
that
you
could
counteract
that
by
any
kind
of
pursuit?
