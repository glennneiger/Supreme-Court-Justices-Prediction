chief
justice
earl

was
this
--
was
this
an
isolated
act
or

this
in
other
similar
circumstances?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
macdonald,
may
i
ask
you
just
one
question.
this
practical
question?
would
the
board
have
been
--
would
the
commission
have
been
likely
to
have
granted
you
this
temporary
license
if
it
had
not
known
that
you
were
applying
for
a
permanent
license?

mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
weston,
may
i
ask
this
question.
suppose
in
this
case
that
the
petitioner
had
--
had
not
or

first
gotten
the
temporary
license.
and
then
the
next
day
after

received
the

license,
he
asked
for
a
permanent
license.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
be
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren

a
consequence

earl
warren
well,
mr.

before

may
i
ask
you
just
one
question.
what
--
what
is
the
most
important
public
interest
that
you
see
that
causes
you
to
be
here
on
behalf
of
the
government
in
opposition
to
the
position
and
the
practice
for
10
years
of
your
own
interstate
commerce
commission?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
see
any
great
danger
that
attaches
to
the
practice
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
here,
anything
that
means
a
danger
that
---
that
you
should
try
to
prevent?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
truly
an
academic
matter
as
to
the
construction
of
the
statute.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
the
government
representing
one
particular
interest
against
another?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right,
mr.
weston.
is
that
mr.
keenan?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
--
is
that
mr.
keenan?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
keenan,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
keenan,
would
it
made
any
difference
in
your
position
here
if
the
application
for
a
permanent
license
had
not
been
made
until
after
this
temporary
one
was
granted?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
mr.
macdonald
to
say
that
your
position
was
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
