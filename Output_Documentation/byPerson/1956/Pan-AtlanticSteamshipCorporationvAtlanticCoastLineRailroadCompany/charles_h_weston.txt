mr.
charles
h.
weston
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
supports
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
because
it
believes
that
section
9
(b)
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
does
not
supersede
or
repeal
the
time
limit
which
is
incorporated
in
section
311
(a)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
now,
311
(a)
is
a
part
of
the
water
carrier
act.
and
its
relation
to
the
regulatory
scheme
of
that
act
is
of
some
importance.
the
act
makes
it
unlawful
to
operate
as
a
common
carrier
by
water
unless
the
carrier
has
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
in
necessity
issued
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
as
to
operations
which
are
--
were
being
carried
on
before
the
act
was
passed,
the
commission
is
directed
to
issue
a
certificate.
but
as
to
any
certificate
other
than
one
covering
these
so-called
grandfather
rights,
certain
steps
have
to
be
taken.
it's
necessary
to
file
a
sworn
application
and
give
notice
to
interested
parties.
there
was
then
a
hearing
at
which
opponents
may
be
heard,
and
present
evidence,
and
argument.
finally,
the
commission
may
issue
a
certificate
only
if
it
finds
on
the
text
developed
at
the
hearing
that
the
proposed
service
is
or
will
be
required
by
public
convenience
or
necessity.
the
certificate
specifies
that
we
had
a
routes
to
be
operated
and
once
the
certificate
is
issued
this
is
permanent.
the
commission
has
not
power
to
revoke
it.
that
was
held
in
the
seatrain
case.
now,
the
statute,
therefore,
provides
for
exercise
of
control
over
entry
into
the
business
of
coastal
or
inland
water
carrier
operations.
this
is
a
provision
which
safeguards
against
slicing
the
traffic
quite
too
thin
in
particular
areas
of
types
of
operation.
it
also
gives
the
commission
power
to
select
the
best
qualified
where
there
are
several
applicants.
now,
the
one
circumstance
in
which
a
certificate
is
not
required
is
where
there
is
a
grant
of
temporary
operating
authority.
and
this
is
to
be
granted
where
service
should
be
provided
to
meet
an
urgent
and
immediate
need.
the
commission
may
grant
this
authority,
if
it
meets
the
words
of
the
section
in
its
discretion
and
without
hearings
or
other
proceedings.
and
the
grant
shall
be
valid
for
not
more
than
180
days.
now,
these
temporary
grants
are
breached
in
the
scheme
for
control
over
entry
into
the
business.
they
do
not
have
to
meet
the
broad
test
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
determined
after
hearings.
they
essentially
provide
for
some
reaction
on
an
ex
parte
showing.
now,
it's
true
that
the
commission
gives
notice
to
some
carriers
who
may
think
are
affected
and
they
are
permitted
to
file
written
statements.
but
the
action
is
essentially
summary.
congress
gave
this
open
hand
to
the
commission
in
granting
these
authorities,
but
at
the
same
time
as
the
counterbalance,
it
fixed
a
definite
time
limit
on
their
duration.
and
legislative
history
shows
that
this
was
not
an
over
sight.
that
it
was
designed
and
purposeful.
it
has
been
mentioned
that
311
(a)
is
derived
from
section
210
(a),
which
was
added
to
the
motor
carrier
act
in
1938.
in
fact,
the
two
sections
are
verbatim.
the
commission
recommended
adoption
of
210
(a)
and
alerted
congress.
it
took
notice
of
the
fact
in
this
letter
that
the
absolute
discretion,
which
was
being
given
to
the
commission,
would
mean
that
care
would
have
to
used
to
protect
the
legitimate
interest
of
other
carriers
and
that
power
of
this
kind,
it
said,
could
be
abused.
it
then
says,
"but
in
event
the
grant
would
be
strictly
limited
in
time",
after
suggesting
that
the
commission
was
not
likely
to
use
this
power
inappropriately.
so,
the
strict
time
limitation
was
put
before
congress
as
a
factor
which
might
mitigate
against
abuses
possibly
developing
in
administration
of
power
which
was
entirely
discretionary.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
in
the
first
place,
there
may
be
a
very
inadequate
showing
of
one
side
of
presentation.
there's
no
--
no
opportunity
to
test
it.
merely
letters
or
communications
submitted
or
--or
an
application
which
the
commission
more
or
less
takes
on
its
face
and
that
then,
under
the
interpretation
that's
been
given
to
9
(b),
that
may
freeze
the
situation
for
two,
three,
or
even
four
years.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
don't
know
how
many
are
made.
the
commission
gives
figures
on
how
many
are
granted,
and
something
like
2000
--
averaging
2000
a
year.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no,
i
do
not.
now,
the
commission
interprets
the
last
section
of
9
(b)
as
nullifying
this
time
limit,
where
the
grant
give
temporary
authority
as
applied
for
a
certificate
of
permanent
authority
and
it's
not
yet
been
acted
upon.
where
the
licensing
statute
permits
license
renewal
or
successive
periodic
licenses,
9
(b)
operates
fairly
and
equitably
and
it
produces
results
which
are
very
reasonable.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
where
the
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
where
the
licensing
statute
permits.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
license
renewal
or
successive
periodic
licenses
such
as
under
the
communications
act,
where
you
get
a
broadcasting
license
for
three
years
and
it
can
be
successively
renewed.
in
that
case,
the
law
itself
authorizes
and
contemplates
license
continuity
and
9
(b)
prevents
a
break
in
that
continuity
which
may
be
due
to
administrative
delay
or
inadvertence.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
--
i
do
not
think
that
situation
is
the
same,
where
the
licensing
statute
permits
successive
licenses.
there
it
--
the
natural
situation
would
be
that
the
holder
of
a
license
and
it's
been
patently
true
in
the
case
of
radio
broadcasting
licenses
that
they
are
renewed
at
the
end
of
the
period.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
it
usually,
i
think,
comes
up
but
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i'm
speaking
broadly.
but,
of
course,
there
are
instances
where
there
are
attacks
but
that
is
the
usual
situation.
here,
we
have
a
grant
which
is
limited
in
time
and
final.
that's,
once
the
180
days
under
the
--
under
the
original
law,
that's
all
that
can
be
given.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i'm
--
i'm
afraid
i
don't
quite
follow
that
thought
that
--
i'm
just
saying
that
if
you
--
if
a
man
gets
a
license,
if
a
station
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
it
has
to
apply
for
a
renewal
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
--
and
--
and
speaks
by
the
agency
rule.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
--
i
think
i
would
--
would
disagree
with
that.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
to
get
the
original
license
it
was
necessary
to
satisfy
the
statutory
standards
for
getting
that
license.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
and
this
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes,
and
--
and
also
the
law
provided
that
you
could
get
it
again
for
another
three
years
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
--
it
provided
the
means.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
and
until
that
determination
is
made,
this
section
9
(b)
would
keep
that
alive.
here,
the
--
to
the
holder
of
the
grant
--
grantee
of
operating
authority
is
met
--
not
met
any
of
the
really
substantive
tests
of
the
law.
he's
come
in
on
a
summary,
showing
emergency
need.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
--
i
may
say
that
i
may
be
wrong.
that
my
impression
is
the
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
--
is
the
other.
now,
the
administrative
procedure
act
is
not
directed
to
and
does
not
change
substantive
rights.
it
deals
solely
with
procedure
in
administrating
federal
administrative
proceedings.
it's
purposes
to
regularize
that
procedure.
under
the
commission's
interpretation,
the
effect
of
the
section
is
to
change
the
substantive
law.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
they
--
they
relate
to
procedure.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
think
that
where
there's
a
--
a
definite
time
limit
fixed
on
temporary
operating
authorities
to
say
that
that
time
limit
is
somehow
going
out
the
window
because
of
a
procedural
statute,
is
a
change
in
substantive
law.
if
you
look
at
this
section
in
relation
to
the
other
provisions
of
the
act,
section
309
prohibits
operating
without
a
certificate,
except
as
provided
in
311.
311
says,
you
may
--
may
have
an
--
a
temporary
authority
which
shall
be
valid
for
not
more
than
180
days.
now
--
now
9
(b)
comes
along
and
says
this
authority
which
under
prior
law
shall
not
be
valid
for
more
than
180
days,
is
valid
for
more
than
180
days.
9
(b)
validates
what
section
311
made
invalid.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes,
but
you
have
to
go
all
--
through
all
the
procedure
to
get
that.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
oh,
not
forever,
of
course.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
--
i
understood
mr.
justice
burton
to
ask
about
the
permanent
certificate.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes,
the
permanent
certificate
but
you
have
first
to
establish
that
issuing
it
is
in
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
--
with
its
relation
to
other
carrier,
you
part
in
the
whole
scheme
of
carrier
operations.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
in
connection
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
it
--
it
can
run
only
until
the
permanent
authority
application
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
--
is
finally
determined.
but
commission
under
the
construction
that's
been
given
9
(b),
exercises
no
choice
about
the
temporary
authority
being
continued
if
there
has
been
the
application
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
--
for
the
permanent
authority.
in
other
words,
the
urgent,
and
pubic,
and
immediate
need
for
service
may
have
entirely
passed
by
the
end
of
180
days.
but
there's
a
pending
application
for
a
permanent
authority,
the
matter
runs.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
i'll
just
mentioned
that
in
passing
as
--
as
indicating
that
where
the
permanent
certificate
has
been
issued,
then
that
is
in
fact
permanent.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
think
that
the
provision
that
a
temporary
authority
shall
be
valid
for
not
more
than
180
days
would
prevent
issuing
a
second
temporary
authority
to
the
same
person,
because
if
you
can
do
that
the
180-day
limit
becomes
meaningless.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
the
proof
is,
just
briefly,
urgent
and
immediate
need
of
service
and
as
we
--
as
i
said
before,
the
commission
may
act
without
hearings
or
other
proceedings.
so
that
there
is
very
little
test.
now,
maybe
it
seems
a
little
odd
to
me
that
we
should
be
--
should
have
been
an
average
of
over
2000
emergency
situations
per
year
if
there
has
been
really
“scrutiny”
of
what
constitutes
emergency
needs.
but
be
that
as
it
may
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
--
there
is
no
real
opportunity.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
what?
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes,
that's
the
sole
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
in
that
sense,
it
deprives
other
carriers
of
the
right
to
make
their
voices
heard
in
a
way
that
will
be
effective
before
there
is
a
change
in
the
transportation
system.
for
example
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes,
it
--
or
who
--
who
is
the
best
person
to
--
to
come
in.
it
well
has
been
just
the
first
one
who
happens
to
get
to
the
commission.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
that's
right.
and
which
--
which
figures
in
the
brief
of
the
railroad
appellee
show
that
may
be
two
or
three
years
beyond
the
180
days.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
oh,
of
course
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
that's
not
the
norm,
no.
if
congress
--
and
there
is
a
bill
pending
now,
as
there
has
been
some
bills
in
the
last
few
years
to
change
this
provision,
it
might
set
up
adequate
safeguards.
i
am
not
contending
that
there's
anything
inherently
evil
in
permitting
temporary
operating
authorities.
but
that
where
congress
deliberately
fixed
this
limit
of
time,
then
if
for
this
to
change
that,
it
should
have
opportunity
to
tighten
up
the
procedure.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
it
is
--
it
is
this
mainly
based
on
--
and
yes.
that
this
--
this
is
in
effect,
we
think,
very
definitely
are
repealed
by
implication.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
it's
a
question
whether
you
can
regard
a
grant
given
in
this
very
summary
fashion
as
deserving
of
a
particular
protection.
now,
as
the
letter
from
the
commission
pointed
out,
there
was
danger
that
in
the
quick
--
if
you
want
to
call
it
hasty
action
that
the
commission
was
expected
to
take
in
what
we
refer
to
in
the
commission's
letter
as
--
as
emergency
situations.
that
there
would
not
be
a
sufficient
canvassing
of
all
the
applicant's
considerations
and
therefore,
that
it
was
desirable
to
place
a
time
limit
on
these
grants
given
in
this
summary
fashion.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
they
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
that
--
that
is
--
that
might
sometimes
occur.of
course,
it
is
not
like
a
thing
out
of
a
new
railroad
line
as
there's
trucks
or
buses
can
move
in
one
area
and
then
in
another.
boats
--
boats
also
can
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
in
other
words
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
if
this
particular
carrier
has
to
stop
its
operations,
then
there's
no
reason
why
a
new
carrier
may
not
come
in
and
be
given
temporary
authority.
and
then
the
commission
will
try
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
it
--
if
he
was
going
to
let
the
first
comer
have
this
field
to
himself
then
it
means
that
the
commission's
action
on
the
temporary
authority
becomes
pretty
much
in
substance,
final
action.
there's
the
fact
that
the
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
don't
know.
i'm
not
familiar
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
--
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
--
that
aspect
to
the
case.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
i
--
i
don't
--
i
--
i
don't
make
--
i'm
not
supporting
the
particular
point
made
in
the
district
court's
decision
in
stone's
express
that
you
have
to
receive
your
temporary
license
before
you
made
your
application
for
permanent
authority.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
it's
a
possible
point
but
it
seems
to
me
rather
technical
and
doubtful
one.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
that's
right.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
the
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
i
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
that's
--
that's
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
think
that
the
--
well,
the
ohio
statute,
i
do
not
regard
as
conclusive
from
the
stand
point
of
legislative
history.
it
--
at
least
is
of
some
bearing
that
the
senate
judiciary
committee
referred
to
this
--
that
as
a
similar
provision
that
expressly
was
limited
to
cases
of
application
for
a
license
of
the
same
type
per
class.
now,
i
think
that
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
if
--
if
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
let
me
read
this
first.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
the
--
the
words
--
i
don't
think
you
need
legislative
history
here.
the
words
are,
"a
new
license
of
the
same
type
or
class,
or
renewal
of
an
existing
license."
that's
those
words.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well
in
the
reis
case,
in
341
u.s.,
this
court
unanimously
rejected
a
--
an
interpretation
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
the
question
is
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
do
not
think
that
you
--
our
case
rests
at
all
solely
on
the
ohio
statute.
i
think
that
if
you
take
the
idea
of
it,
you
can
--
one
application
of
--
for
a
license,
whether
it's
the
same
or
not
keeps
an
existing
license.
so,
i'm
supposing
i
have
a
radio
broadcasting
license.
i
applied
for
a
certificate
to
operate
as
a
motor
carrier.
is
the
pendency
of
that
application
to
keep
the
other
license
alive?
now
here,
there
is
one
point
of
similarity
between
the
existing
license,
that
of
a
temporary
authority
and
the
permanent.
they
involve
particular
water
operations.
but
their
statutory
standards
for
the
grant
are
different.
they
are
wide
apart
in
the
procedure
for
obtaining
them.
and
the
--
are
wide
apart
in
what
--
in
the
right
conferred.
in
one
case
180-day
authorization,
in
the
other
case
permanent
authorization.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no,
i
didn't.
i
think
also
it
should
be
noted.
that
the
commission
in
its
--
when
it
first
denounced
this
ruling,
stated
in
announcing
it
that
to
which
had
great
doubt
as
to
its
correctness.
it
stated
that
was
a
division
of
legal
opinion
as
to
whether
it
could
do
this.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
it
appears
in
pages
33
and
34
of
the
brief
of
the
railroad
appellees.
and
you'll
find
the
language
to
which
i
am
referring
in
the
second
--
the
first
full
paragraph
in
that
page.
i
think
that
the
commission,
it's
fair
to
say,
made
this
ruling
as
a
matter
of
expediency
--
legitimate
expediency
but
that
was
the
real
basis.
it's
very
difficult
to
test
this
kind
of
thing
because
it
matters
--
have
to
become
mooted
any
moment
just
as
it
did
in
stone's
express.
by
the
time
you
go
through
district
court
proceeding
and
then
get
to
this
court,
that
matter
is
--
have
to
become
moot.
now,
we
do
also
think
that
this
is
a
case
where
the
specific
statute
ought
to
prevail
over
the
general
one.
well,
that
has
been
mentioned
earlier
and
i'm
--
my
half
hour
has
expired.
i'm
going
to
divide
my
time.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
i
--
i
think
that
in
--
in
this
particular
instance,
it's
our
reading
of
the
statute
in
the
light
of
the
--
at
the
full
statutory
test.
that
we
do
not
see
a
real
justification
for
saying
that
this
general
statute
applies
so
as
to
cut
down
a
time
limitation
that
congress
deliberately
put
in
as
to
impose
this
to
a
particular
kind
of
license.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no,
i
don't
think
that
its
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
i
suppose
academic
in
the
sense
that
construction
of
any
statute
is
a
matter
of
importance.
and
--
and
i
think
that
there
are
conflicting
interests.
that
there
are
other
potential
carriers
who
may
be
shut
out
because
of
the
running
of
these
temporary
authorities
that
made
the
effects
on
competitors.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
oh,
no.
and
of
course
not.
it
is
not
doing
that,
no.
