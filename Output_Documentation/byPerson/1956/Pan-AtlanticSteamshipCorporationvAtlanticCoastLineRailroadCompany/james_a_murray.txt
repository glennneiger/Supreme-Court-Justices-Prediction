mr.
james
a.
murray
my
name
is
james
a.
murray.
i'm
here
for
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
number
424.
i
want
to
follow
up
on
mr.
macdonald's
statement
of
a
slight
difference
of
opinion
between
his
position
and
our
position.
that
is,
with
respect
to
the
meaning
of
section
9
(b).
he
regards
the
section
as
operating
directly
upon
the
license.
we
regard
it
as
being
mandatory
upon
the
commission
to
take
the
action
when
the
facts
stated
in
the
have
found
to
exist.
and
that
is
the
only
difference
in
that
--
mr.
james
a.
murray
yes.
mr.
james
a.
murray
yes.
mr.
james
a.
murray
well,
it
would
--
the
commission
refuse
or
refused
that
won't
be
reviewable
in
--
in
the
same
manner.
although,
the
commission's
decisions
are
reviewable.
mr.
james
a.
murray
well,
i
--
i
was
withdrawing
a
mandatory
--
mr.
james
a.
murray
--
approval
to
that
extent.
mr.
james
a.
murray
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
james
a.
murray
the
commission
must
--
mr.
james
a.
murray
well,
it
--
the
--
the
net
result
is
the
same
in
--
but
it
--
our
theory
keeps
the
commission
in
control
and
keeps
a
record
of
who
is
authorized
to
be
in
operation
or
--
mr.
james
a.
murray
--
and
follows
a
regular
process.
mr.
james
a.
murray
oh,
yes.
yes.
mr.
james
a.
murray
well,
i
think
that
the
person
should
have
to
bring
an
action
to
compel
the
commission
to
do
it
in
order
to
get
some
action.
mr.
james
a.
murray
yes,
your
honor.
it
--
mr.
james
a.
murray
that
--
that's
correct,
sir.
the
very
action
is
to
set
aside
this
order
of
the
commission,
which
authorized
pan-atlantic
to
continue
beyond
180
days
--
mr.
james
a.
murray
that
--
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
james
a.
murray
now,
the
commission
in
regards
--
does
not
regard
that
there
is
any
conflict
between
section
9
(a)
and
section
311.
we
think
that
the
180-day
limitation
in
section
311
is
a
--
merely
a
limitation
upon
the
licensing
power
granted
to
the
commission
by
that
subsection.
that
section
9
(b)
then
grants
additional
authority
and
power,
and
requires
the
extension
when
the
particular
circumstances
are
found
to
exist.
for
that
reason,
we
believe
there's
no
conflict
between
311
and
9
(b).
but
if
there
is
any
conflict,
if
there
is
any
over
lapping,
its
regarded
that
way
by
the
court.
we
think
that
provisions
of
section
10
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
clearly
supercede
and
repeal
the
provisions
of
9
--
of
311
to
the
extent
necessary
to
permit
section
9
(b)
to
operate.
mr.
james
a.
murray
1940,
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
a.
murray
was
passed
in
1946.
mr.
james
a.
murray
now,
in
between
there
i
might
--
i'm
going
to
that
since
you
raised
your
question.
in
1942,
the
180-day
limitation
in
311
was
suspended
by
the
second
war
powers
act.
now,
that
act
was
renewed
from
year
to
year.
the
last
extension
was
on
june
29,
1946.
now,
on
june
11,
1946,
the
administrative
procedure
act
had
been
passed.
our
friend
suggests
that
if
9
(b)
was
intended
to
apply
there'd
be
no
point
in
the
extension.
but
that
is
not
correct
because
the
administrative
procedure
act
wouldn't
--
did
not
become
effective
until
september
11,
1946.
mr.
james
a.
murray
i
don't
remember.
mr.
james
a.
murray
i
think
it
was
probably
originated
in
a
request
to
the
commission.
it
was
probably
cooperative
undertaking.
mr.
james
a.
murray
but
the
suspension
merely
suspended
the
180-day
limitation.
mr.
james
a.
murray
yes.
mr.
james
a.
murray
yes.
mr.
james
a.
murray
yes,
it
--
mr.
james
a.
murray
there
is
no
discussion
of
this
question.
mr.
james
a.
murray
i've
--
i
have
not
found
any.
now,
the
commissioner,
commissioner
aitchison
testified
before
the
committee
and
he
opposed
many
a
provisions
and
asked
that
the
commission
would
be
except.
but
i
don't
find
--
i
didn't
find
any
discussion
of
this
particular
provision
--
mr.
james
a.
murray
the
original
9
(b)
provision
here
that
became
law
was
first
put
out
in
the
senate
committee
print
of
1945.
now,
that
incidentally,
it
is
relied
upon
greatly
by
our
opponents.
that
print
was
a
waking
paper.
it
was
a
paper
put
out
in
four
parallel
columns,
in
which
there
was
the
--
in
the
first
column
there
was
a
draft
of
the
statute,
the
second
was
a
draft
for
the
amendments
of
the
committee,
and
third
was
comment,
and
explanation,
and
forth
was
a
comment
on
--
on
various
proposals
that
had
been
made.
and
its
purpose
was
to
elicit
comment
and
criticisms
so
as
to
better
improve
the
bill.
when
the
senate
committee
reported
to
the
senate,
they
made
no
mention
of
this
ohio
statute
that
has
caused
so
much
confusion.
and
neither
did
the
house
committee
mention
it.
and
neither
was
it
mentioned
on
the
floor
of
the
house
or
the
senate.
it
was
just
a
casual
reference
in
a
waking
paper,
you
might
it
call
it.
mr.
james
a.
murray
the
attorney
general
conference?
mr.
james
a.
murray
yes.
mr.
james
a.
murray
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
james
a.
murray
i
don't
recall
any
--
mr.
james
a.
murray
i
don't
know
of
any
comment
on
that
at
all.
so
far
as
i
know
in
the
senate
committee,
someone
thought
it
up
or
they
came
across
this
ohio
statute
and
they
thought
it'd
be
excellent
to
put
that
in
the
bill.
so
far
as
i
can
see
that's
--
that's
what
happened.
now,
i
--
i
think
they
gathered
from
the
ohio
statute
owning
the
idea
of
protecting
licensees
from
having
their
license
expired.
i
don't
think
that
they
intended
any
technical
requirement
of
restricting
its
privileges
to
those
who
technically
had
a
license
at
the
time
they
filed
application
for
renewal.
that
was
seen
to
be
utterly
foreign
to
their
purpose.
i
can't
imagine
that
they
would
regard
that
as
so
important.
mr.
james
a.
murray
in
nourishing
this?
mr.
james
a.
murray
yes
--
mr.
james
a.
murray
the
fcc,
federal
communication
commission
has
renewable
licenses
and
they
follow
the
practice.
i
don't
know
--
so
far
as
i
know
they
do
not
function
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
they
did
the
same
thing
before
then.
now,
the
civil
aeronautics
board
has
put
out
a
set
of
regulations.
they're
published
in
the
federal
register
and
they're
cited
in
our
brief,
which
make
use
of
this
statute
in
connection
with
this
temporary
exemptions.
an
exemption
is
a
license
within
the
definition
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
the
same
as
a
grant
of
authority.
and
the
cab
in
its
regulation
indicates
that
it
follows
a
9
(b)
and
regards
it
is
binding
on
the
agency.
mr.
james
a.
murray
in
our
brief,
we
show
that
the
commission
during
the
last
five
years
has
extended
under
authority
of
section
9
(b),
an
average
of
412
--
mr.
james
a.
murray
412
per
year.
now,
over
a
10-year
period,
that
would
amount
to
something
like
4000.
mr.
james
a.
murray
the
brief
of
the
railroads
has
some
figures
on
that.
and
incidentally
that
on
page
49
of
the
railroad
brief,
they
show
that
they
made
a
digest
of
the
purchase
applications.
that
is,
the
cases
under
section
5,
the
unification
provision
in
which
the
extensions
were
made
under
section
210
(a)
(b)
and
they
found
that
1030
permanent
orders.
now,
and
in
these
--
among
these
were
194
temporary
acquisition
orders.
now,
of
those
194
temporary
acquisition
orders,
that
101
were
extended
beyond
180
days.
so
that's
roughly
50%.
now,
they
have
figures
in
the
back
of
their
brief
which
shows
that
these
extensions
run
all
the
way
from
23
days
to
three
years
and
eight
months.
that
--
that's
the
only
figures
that
we
have
covering
the
matter.
i
might
mention
that
the
commission's
annual
report
show
it
had
almost
between
2500
and
3000
applications
for
certificates
and
permits
per
year.
and
that
the
412
extensions
average
per
year
during
the
past
five
years,
amounts
to
about
one
out
of
six,
or
one
out
of
seven
or
eight.
mr.
james
a.
murray
no,
sir.
they
issued
the
order
--
mr.
james
a.
murray
until
it
follow
--
until
the
--
mr.
james
a.
murray
yes.
yes,
that's
true
--
mr.
james
a.
murray
--
in
certain
types
of
cases.
mr.
james
a.
murray
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
murray
the
--
the
order
authorizes
a
continuance
until
the
further
order
of
the
commission
but
not
longer
than
the
final
determination
of
the
application
case.
now,
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
section
9
(b),
the
--
every
person
who
mentioned
it,
the
representative
walter
in
the
house,
senator
mccarran
in
the
senate,
and
the
committee
reports,
were
all
very
clear
as
to
what
they
meant.
there
seemed
to
be
no
doubt
about
it.
they
wanted
to
protect
these
licensees
and
the
house
committee
referring
to
the
proposal
which
would
amend
all
acts
inconsistent
with
administrative
procedure
act,
stated
any
inconsistent
agency
action
or
statute
is
in
effect
repealed.
i
would
like
to
explain
a
little
bit
on
how
these
temporary
authorities
are
issued.
the
commission
has
--
has
--
has
arrangements
under
which
it
can
grant
temporary
authority
for
one
shift
or
a
short
period
of
time,
even
though
the
telephone
has
emergency.
but
in
that
case
they
are
limited
to
used
it
--
to
something
like
10
days
or
not
more
than
30
days.
and
if
it
seems
that
it
would
last
longer
they
require
him
to
file
a
new
application
and
go
through
the
normal
procedure.
the
normal
procedure
is
for
the
commission
to
receive
the
application,
notify
all
carriers
who
might
be
interested
in
the
matter
and
afford
them
an
opportunity
to
submit
written
comments
and
statements
of
facts
and
criticism
and
arguments.
the
commission
then
considers
that
and
acts,
and
they
have
--
the
parties
have
the
right
to
appeal
to
a
higher
agency
authority
if
they
desire
and
they
do
often.
these
records
on
which
the
commission
acts
are
in
the
public
files
of
the
commission
and
available
for
anyone
to
examine.
the
commission
does
not,
as
had
been
suggested,
act
on
secret
evidence
and
undisposed
evidence,
and
there
isn't
--
there's
no
record
--
without
a
record.
there
is
a
record
and
this
--
these
cases
have
been
reviewed
in
courts
on
the
records
are
weighed.
in
the
particular
case,
of
course,
the
railroads
had
full
information
about
the
proceedings
and
filed
on
numerous
representations.
when
the
commission
--
when
the
second
war
powers
act
expired,
the
commission
was
left
within
a
large
accumulation
of
temporary
authorities
which
it
extended
under
administrative
procedure
act
in
september
1947.
it,
the
same
year,
reported
to
congress
what
it
had
done.
and
in
the
--
early
in
the
following
year
it
prescribed
and
issued
the
regulations.
and
each
year,
for
many
years
thereafter,
and
perhaps
still
show
in
their
report
to
congress
the
exact
number
of
temporary
authorities
which
have
been
extended
on
this
provision.
mr.
james
a.
murray
well,
i
--
i
think
9
(b)
is
the
more
specific.
mr.
james
a.
murray
yes,
of
course,
9
(b)
--
mr.
james
a.
murray
--
has
a
sweep
in
--
in
general
over
the
--
throughout
the
agency
but
in
--
is
limited
in
its
application.
if
you
take
them
--
water
carrier
or
motor
carrier
provision,
311
applies
to
all
of
them.
but
9
(b)
applies
only
to
certain
particular
ones
of
those
311
cases.
i
think
in
that
way
it's
more
specific
and
certainly
whether
it's
more
specific
or
not,
it
is,
i
think,
you
would
regard
it
as
the
latest
enactment,
since
311
had
been
in
the
law
since
1940,
even
though
it
was
suspended
during
portions
of
the
time
that
limitation
was
suspended.
then
the
administrative
procedure
act
was
passed.
but
even
aside
from
that,
the
provision
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
show
that
is
was
intended
to
amend
and
change
the
existing
statutes.
that
specifically
set
out
in
section
10,
where
the
administrative
procedure
act
says
that
every
agency
is
granted
all
authority
necessary
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
this
act,
to
the
issuance
of
rules
or
otherwise.
and
the
house
in
reporting
on
that
provision
said
any
inconsistent
agency
action
or
statute
is
in
effect
repealed.
and
it's
well-known
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
you
know
was
intended
to
set
up
a
new
code
of
justice,
of
fairness,
and
it
was
then
to
cut
across
statutes,
and
change
procedures
whatever
it
might
be
necessary
to
do
justice.
now,
congress
undoubtedly
thought
that
they
were
doing
justice
in
protecting
these
licensees
from
having
their
license
expire,
where
they
had
--
did
all
they
could
to
get
a
determination
of
the
renewal
and
through
some
fault
of
the
agency
or
the
inability
of
the
agency,
their
determination
had
not
been
made.
mr.
james
a.
murray
yes.
mr.
james
a.
murray
well,
at
the
moment
--
mr.
james
a.
murray
yes.
mr.
james
a.
murray
that
--
that's
all.
mr.
james
a.
murray
that's
all.
the
commission
and,
incidentally,
the
railroad
in
their
briefs
suggest
that
the
commission
was
uncertain
of
its
position
because
in
1946
and
1947
annual
reports,
it
recommended
legislation
on
this
subject.
now,
they
have
misunderstood
the
commission's
recommendations.
the
recommendations,
which
they
quote
in
their
brief
are
recommendations
that
the
commission's
war
powers
over
motor
transport
facilities
and
water
transport
facilities,
are
equivalent
to
that
that
the
commission
has
over
railroad
car
service
under
section
110
to
117
be
continued
as
an
emergency
provision.
now,
this
recommendation
that
the
railroad,
misconceived,
relate
to
those
provisions.
they
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
this
180-day
limitation.
the
commission
first
recommended
legislation
on
this
180-day
limitation
in
1955.
and
that
was
brought
about
by
a
decision
in
the
stone's
express
case.
and
incidentally,
that
i
believe,
mr.
macdonald's
--
i
believe
he
didn't
get
around
to
mentioning
that
that
case
was
appealed
to
this
court
and
before
a
decision
was
reached,
the
commission
had
decided
the
application
case
and
it
became
moot.
so,
there's
some
question,
has
arisen
has
been
brought
up,
at
least,
they're
concerning
the
relation
between
the
scope
of
the
license
held
by
the
applicant
and
the
scope
of
the
application
for
a
new
certificate.
it
has
been
suggested
that
because
section
9
(b)
doesn't
set
on
our
specific
standards
that
the
--
it's
impracticable
and
unrightful.
now,
the
commission
hasn't
had
a
particle
of
trouble
with
that.
it's
very
simple.
when
a
carrier
asks
for
authority
to
transport
coal
between
points
one,
two
and
three,
and
then
if
it
files
a
--
by
a
certificate
to
transport
coal
between
one
--
points
one,
two
and
three,
and
also
lumber
in
between
points
--
other
points
and
additional
commodities,
the
extension
relates
only
to
the
minimum
amount
which
is
common
to
the
two
applications.
and
the
unit
is
the
authority
to
transport
a
commodity
from
one
point
to
another
point.
it
is
simple
and
there's
no
confusion
and
there's
no
reason
for
having
any
trouble
about
that.
mr.
james
a.
murray
well,
it
considers
a
holder
of
a
temporary
authority
a
licensee
and
a
holder
of
a
certificate
--
mr.
james
a.
murray
oh,
pan-atlantic
filed
an
application
that
that
act
of
the
filing
was
not
the
same
day,
i
think.
while
a
temporary
authority
to
establish
immediate
service
and
a
permanent
authority
application
for
a
certificate.
mr.
james
a.
murray
no,
it
was
not.
mr.
james
a.
murray
it's
argued
by
our
friends
that
it's
significant.
mr.
james
a.
murray
and
the
court
--
mr.
james
a.
murray
what
we're
now
--
now,
i
think
--
i
think
there's
some
confusion
there.
pan-atlantic
filed
an
application
for
a
certificate
and
an
application
for
a
temporary
authority
at
the
same
time.
it
wanted
--
it
knew
it
would
take
it
a
year
or
more
to
get
a
certificate
and
there
was
clamors
for
at
least
it
appeared
to
them,
justification
for
issuing
temporary
authority,
so
he
filed
for
that.
now,
the
commission
issued
a
temporary
authority
application.
mr.
james
a.
murray
it
was
not.
mr.
james
a.
murray
well
--
well,
that
--
that
doesn't
come
into
operation.
that
comes
into
operation
only
upon
the
expiration
of
the
temporary
authority
you
see.
mr.
james
a.
murray
that
there's
no
--
there's
no
question
about
the
commission
granting
temporary
authority
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
a.
murray
that's
right.
mr.
james
a.
murray
that
--
that's
where
the
question
comes
or
arises.
now,
some
--
some
arguments
have
been
made
that
unless
pan-atlantic
obtained
this
temporary
authority
and
then
the
next
day
filed
its
application
for
a
permanent
authority,
it
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
9
(b).
whereas,
if
it
had
filed
this
permanent
authority
the
day
before
they
obtained
the
-
the
temporary
authority
it
would
have
been
outlawed,
or
not
within
the
statute.
mr.
james
a.
murray
i
think
you
will.
i
think
the
--
the
argument
is
made
on
that.
but
we
can't
conceive
from
the
legislative
history
and
the
purpose
of
the
statute
why
there
would
ever
be
any
reason
to
make
that
distinction.
because
a
person
filed
his
permanent
authority
application
that
day
and
he
got
his
temporary
authority
tomorrow,
he
loses
out.
but
if
he
got
his
temporary
authority
today
and
filed
his
permanent
application
the
next
day,
he
would
be
protected.
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
us.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
three
minutes
left.
