justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
that
an
ex
parte
extension?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
was
before
the
commission
on
the
original
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
commission
controverted
in
anyway?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
on
the
second
order,
are
the
same
thing
done?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
it's
done
only
on
papers,
i
get
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
are
you
suggesting
that
what
has
the
penalty
that
the
licensee
is
limited
to
a
holder
of
a
permanent
license
and
does
not
embrace
as
in
your
case
the
holding
of
a
temporary
license?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
on
then
that
--
that
means
no
more
than
that
before
the
commissioner's
the
sufficiency
of
the
application
or
that
one
goes
in
the
sufficiency
and
if
sufficient,
the
order
must
issue?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
makes
a
difference
to
the
position.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
issues
a
paper
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
issues
a
paper
which
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
suppose
it
doesn't
issue
the
paper,
are
you
supposed
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
--
whom
does
the
commission
consider
a
licensee?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
in
this
instance,
i
gather,
on
the
8th
who
was
the
application
for
the
temporary
license,
is
that
it?
or
rather
for
the
permanent
license.
on
the
18th,
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
at
the
time
that
it
applied
for
the
temporary
license,
was
it
a
licensee
of
any
kind?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
that
the
mr.
macdonald
told
us
that
that
was
deemed
significant
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at,
apparently,
the
commission
in
this
instance
did
consider
pan-american
a
licensee,
although
actually,
it
held
no
license
at
the
time
it
filed
the
application,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
well,
now,
at
the
time
the
application
was
issued,
was
pan-american
the
holder
of
any
license?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
yet
the
commission
considered
that
for
the
purposes
of
9
(b)
it
was
a
licensee?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
the
time
the
renewal
application
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
filed.
it
certainly
was
a
licensee.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
we
do
--
do
we
have
to
decide
that
issue
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
--
but
mr.
weston,
you
still
do
works
on
this
i
gather
that
9
(b)
doesn't
reach
this
kind
of
license
at
all.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
9
(b)
reaches
only
those
types
of
licenses
with
periodically
must
be
renewed
until
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
a
permanent
license
here
is
of
indefinite
direction
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
is
not
of
that
kind
and
a
temporary
license
pending
the
issuance
of
that
kind
of
permanent
license
is
not
within
9
(b).
is
that
your
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
may
a
311
application
be
made
independently
of
the
309
application?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
know
what
the
practice
has
been?
have
there
been
311
applications
except
there's
those
pending
or
shortly
thereafter
filed
as
309?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
has
been
the
practice
usually?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
i
gather
there
is
of
the
application
for
the
permanent
certificate
was
for
permission
to
provide
the
identical
service
which
was
permitted
by
the
temporary
certificate
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
in
fact
served
under
the
temporary
certificate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
i
gather
when
the
judgment
below
came
down
that
--
that
the
pan-am
stopped
that
service,
whatever
it
was.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
has
there
been
any
connection
between
the
pendencing
--
pendecy
of
--
pendency
of
this
case
and
the
action
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
on
the
permanent
application?
in
other
words,
has
the
latter
been
deferred
until
this
thing
was
decided?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
yet
it's
how
long,
did
you
say
two
years?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
the
point
thought
of?
is
that
necessary?
just
to
take
that
one
and
do
this
thing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
perhaps
not.
but
does
it
take
them
three
years,
three
and
a
half
years
to
complete
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
something
wrong
about
a
process.
it
seems
to
me
if
it
takes
that
long.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
any
other
reasons
why
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
it's
the
opposition
of
the
carriers
which
drags
these
things
on
for
so
long?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
--
do
these
proceedings
go
on
in
continuous
hearings
or
are
there
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
hiatuses?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
once
you
start
the
hearings,
do
you
go
through
them?
do
you
complete
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
hard
for
me
to
understand
why
all
that
should
be
necessary.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
three
years
time.
