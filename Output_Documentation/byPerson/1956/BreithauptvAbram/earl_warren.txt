mr
shermack,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
attorney
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
attorney
general
robinson,
in
distinguishing
these
two
cases,
suppose
instead
of
taking
a
blood
test,
they
--
here
they
had
--
they
had
taken
the
stomach
test
while
he
unconscious
--
unconscious
as
they
did
in
the
rochin
case,
would
you
still
distinguish
the
cases
on
the
grounds
of
the
--
of
the
difference
between
the
--
the
two
things
that
were
done?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
--
would
you
distinguish
that
the
two
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
no
physical
opposition
to
taking
it
as
it
was
in
the
rochin
case,
do
you
think
that
makes
any
difference?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then,
if
it
was
a
weak
person
physically
who
--
who
couldn't
object,
let
us
say
a
woman
or
--
or
a
child,
you
would
think
that
we
wouldn't
have
another
rochin
case
because
they
had
physically
resisted
the
--
the
efforts
of
the
officers
to
do
that,
would
you
--
would
you
go
that
far?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
do
you
think
in
the
rochin
case,
if
the
man
had
just
said,
i
object
to
--
to
your
doing
this
and
then
had
not
resisted
the
officers
forcibly
and
--
and
they
had
pumped
his
stomach
as
they
did,
do
you
feel
that
would
immaterially
have
changed
the
posture
of
the
case
so
far
as
the
decisions
was
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
will
take
the
law
--
the
law
itself
would
resist
for
a
man
who
is
totally
unconscious.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
attorney
general,
may
i
ask
this
one
for
more
--
yes
sir.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
more
question.
i'm
--
i'm
trying
to
think
through
what
other
kind
of
cases
this
might
also
apply
to
if
your
position
was
--
was
sustained,
suppose
that
there
was
a
criminal
case
involving
the
paternity
of
a
child,
and
the
police
went
out
and
arrested
the
man
and
--
and
personally
took
his
--
but
we
won't
--
won't
say
after
he
had
a
fight
like
in
rochin,
but
--
but
they
compelled
him
to
let
a
doctor
take
his
blood
in
order
to
test
it
and
determine
that
that
was
the
same
type
of
blood
as
the
child.
do
you
think
that
would
be
sustained?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
--
let's
leave
out
--
let's
leave
out
the
illegal
entry
and
arrest.
they
--
they
--
let's
say
they
--
they
arrest
him
and
saw
him
on
the
street
and
just
took
him
in
--
took
him
up
to
the
--
the
jail
and
had
the
jail
doctor
against
his
protest
to
take
his
blood
in
order
to
determine
if
that
was
a
type
of
blood
of
the
child
involved
so
they
could
use
it
against
him
on
the
--
on
the
trial.
chief
justice
earl
warren
these
concepts
are
all
growing
two
years
ago
and
they
renew
anything
about
the
blood
types
that
--
maybe
hear
it
from
now
or
if
we
sustain
this,
the
doctors
might
agree
that
on
--
on
some
--
by
what
similarity
of
blood
type
means
that
we
might
arrive
at
a
different
--
different
position
than
we
are
today.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
mr.
kegel.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
have
that
procedure
in
your
state
of
motion
to
suppress
evidence
before
the
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
mean
there's
matter
of
procedure,
do
you
--
do
you
have
any
such
motion
in
the
criminal
case
to
suppress
evidence.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
would
an
unconscious
man
know
that
he
was
going
to
be
brought
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
i
am
--
i
am
just
speaking
in
the
abstract
not
as
--
not
as
this
defendant
but
if
it
was
taken
from
him
while
he
was
unconscious,
how
would
he
know
that
that
it
was
going
to
be
used
against
him
and
how
could
he
logically
be
required
to
make
the
motion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
kegel
may
i
ask
--
ask
you
would
it
make
any
difference
in
your
position
if
in
this
case
the
blood
test
--
the
blood
was
taken
by
a
highway
patrol
officer
instead
of
a
doctor?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
i
--
my
point
is
directed
to
--
to
this
if
--
if
we
should
sustain
your
--
your
position,
would
that
mean
that
we
were
--
were
or
it
was
open
sesame
for
police
officers
for
highway
patrolman
or
anybody
who
might
not
be
qualified
to
--
to
do
this
thing,
who
might
handle
--
handle
the
syringe
negligently,
might
not
keep
it
clean,
might
i
do
any
number
of
things
to
be
harmful
to
--
to
people
who
are
under
arrest,
would
it
--
would
it
mean
that
we
would
be
opening
it
up
to
--
to
that
kind
of
conduct
on
the
part
of
police
officers
all
over
the
country?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
kegel,
you
mentioned
what
your
--
your
administrative
practices
where
--
what
--
what
are
the
--
insofar
as
blood
taking
is
concerned
in
your
normal
driving
while
drunk
case,
do
you
do
it?
do
you
--
never
to
do
it
in
new
mexico
in
all
cases
or
--
or
is
it
just
down
in
serious
or
occasional
in
your
important
cases.
chief
justice
earl
warren
by
pending
--
by
consent.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
shermack.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
shermack,
it's
our
information
that
you

this
defendant
is
an
indigent

through

through
the
courts
of
your

and
for
that
reason,
