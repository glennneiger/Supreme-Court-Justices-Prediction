justice
felix
frankfurter
how
else
could
we
be
here?
how
else
could
you
be
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
one
doesn't
determine
a
problem
of
this
sort
by
absolving
it
due
by
creating
new
process
and
the
shorthand
two
words
for
denial
of
the
first
amendment
which
is
toward
an
attempt,
and
therefore,
one
cannot
say
the
self
incrimination
with
this
unlawful
search
and
seizure,
one
must
go
to
(inaudible)
on
each
particular
situation,
is
there
any
escape
from
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
means
because
there
may
be
situation
that
violates
due
process
and
do
not
infringe
or
impinge
upon
a
lawful
search
and
seizure.
the
wolf
case
dealt
with
the
particular
phase,
had
it,
whether
the
week's
(inaudible)
is
incorporated
in
the
process.
justice
felix
frankfurter
never
mind
now.
i
don't
think
(inaudible)
that's
all
that
case
concerns.
so
that
--
but
--
unlawful
search
and
seizure
aren't
the
only
things
even
in
their
ugliest
forms
that
they
divide
it
with
due
process.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
unless
you
can
take
it
under
one
of
the
nine
amendments,
what
can
you
do
except
go
to
the
substance
and
see
what
are
the
kinds
of
things
that
outdated
that
sense
of
justice
which
then
contain
the
due
process?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
done
on
all
of
the
cases.
it
was
done
in
palko,
it
was
done
in
(inaudible)
due
process
clause
was
conceived
to
be
not
restricted
to
procedural
informants.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
nothing
new,
this
is
a
consistent
cause
of
decision
of
this
court,
by
decision
by
me
with
the
court
as
adjudicated
(inaudible)
against.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
is
such
a
thing
as
shocking
conduct
in
life?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
conduct
that
didn't
shock.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
everybody
may
not
agree
what
conduct
is
or
isn't
shocking.there
are
such
things
as
shocking
conduct
and
non-shocking
conduct.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
it
should
be
3754
from
that
fact,
the
kind
that
i
cannot
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
true.
they
carry
the
legislation
unconstitutional.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
that
they
have
enough,
sometimes
only
one
as
to
--
to
--
by
what
your
court
include
meaning
five
that
is
unconstitutional,
the
board
say
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
so
what
is
there
so
abnormal
about
this
was
to
the
opinion
on
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
the
court
is
a
majority.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
there
five
members
of
this
court,
you
find
it
shocking,
you
already
indicated
with
--
appropriate
(inaudible)
attorney
general
that
you
would
regard
having
the
lawful
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
according
--
what
if
--
what
the
majority
does.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
the
court
does.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
the
court
consider
on
that
point
of
view
and
that's
when
hypothetical
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
that's
why
an
important
decision
of
this
court
had
been
five-to-four.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
we're
going
to
go
in
and
wait
for
any
as
some
new
test
by
which
we
decide
that
the
four
have
more
sense
of
breaking
wisdom
then
we
might
as
well
give
up
the
whole
show
of
judicial
conduct.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
attorney
general,
i
don't
want
to
leave
you
in
any
doubt
that
i
assume
would
welcome
greatly,
if
you
could
give
me
a
rule
of
thumb
by
which
a
question
that
i
think
i
asked
you
separately,
the
determination
that
was
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
about
negligence?
how
about
when
there's
murder
at
the
first
degree
or
manslaughter,
would
be
illegal
to
lay
down
(inaudible)
determinations?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
we
did,
we
wouldn't
have
so
many
negligence
cases
brought
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
because
the
negligence
cases
are
brought
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
it's
good
that
he
has
followed
the
verdict
because
those
test
satisfied
whatever
the
constitutional
requirements
has
been
satisfied
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
it
follows
in
that
state
you
are
to
consume.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
that
the
argument
isn't
relevant
but
it
doesn't
follow.
it
said
in
--
in
the
conflict
of
the
criminal
prosecution
that
there
are
(inaudible)
at
ease
or
people
make
the
suggestion
at
lease
to
which
they
may
not
consume
litigation
after
all
appellate
in
ever
--
the
civil
litigation
have
a
discovery
brought
against
us,
brought
against
them
because
--
in
a
criminal
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
the
statutory
safeguard
against
the
light
vehicle?
what
about
any
difference,
what
about
the
statutory
safeguards
of
cases
before
us
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
but
it
doesn't
say
who
can
do
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
there
any
regulations
of
any
--
it
just
happened
that
this
was
the
doctrine
in
this
case,
is
that
the
practice?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
did
u.s.
law
officer
for
the
state
of
new
mexico
say
that
in
the
administrative
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
i
haven't
--
do
you
have
any
intention
to
have
you
give
assurance
as
that
it
takes
(inaudible)
as
a
matter
of
practice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
attorney
general
of
new
mexico
controls
or
what
kind
of
control
have
you
on
a
local
law
enforcement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
that
the
attorney
general
can
determine
whether
district
attorney
doesn't
discharge
his
duty
and
move
in?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
can
replace
the
district
attorney?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
the
government
in
your
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
attorney
general
independently,
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
will
if
you
could
add
it
that
it
needs
money
to
file
district
attorney
and
for
district
attorney's
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
needs
some
other
things
also.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
--
is
this
remotely
like
a
spinal
puncture,
it
would
be
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
no
child's
play.
