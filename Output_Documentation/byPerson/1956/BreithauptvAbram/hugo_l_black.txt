what
do
you
mean
by
hypodermic?
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
in
that
respect
that
involve
--
involving
a
hypodermic?
you
mean
taken
out
with
a
needle?
justice
hugo
l.
black
wouldn't
make
any
difference
whether
its
1
cc
or
20
according
to
your
argument,
would
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
cite
that
last
case
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
are
the
circumstances,
which
in
your
judgment,
would
make
the
taking
of
sampling
from
the
stomach
was
more
shocking
to
judges
than
the
taking
of
blood
from
the
body?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
saying
then
if
this
man
has
been
awake,
they'd
take
--
well,
what
then,
in
your
judgment,
let's
assume
that
he
had
been
awake
and
they'd
taken
it
--his
blood
instead
of
taking
something
from
his
stomach.
what
are
the
circumstances
then
which
in
your
judgment
would
make
one
more
shocking
than
the
other?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
should
make
it
more
shocking
than
the
other?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
a
little
more
unpleasant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
although
some
--
something
(inaudible)
pretty
unpleasant
as
the
needle,
it
certainly
is.
justice
hugo
l.
black
more
unpleasant
to
think
about.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
for
everybody?
are
there
some
people
--
are
there
some
people
who
faint
when
they
take
the
blood
and
who
can
swallow
the
pump
with
ease?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
--
do
you
think
it
is
inconceivable
as
a
person
could
take
the
pump
with
ease?i
have
read
some
myself
(voice
overlap).
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
there
might
be
a
difference
as
in
the
way
it
is
--
the
operation
on
the
stomach
pump
effects
on
the
man
and
the
force
that
they
applied
to
put
it
--
make
him
take
it
and
whether
it
makes
him
sick
afterwards,
would
that
have
anything
to
do
with
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
there
any
ways
for
the
state
courts
to
have
--
have
a
stand
with
it
which
is
safe
for
them
to
follow
in
connection
with
deciding
how
much
it
might
shock
the
majority
of
this
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
to
be
governed
by
the
circumstances.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
has
to
be
governed
by
the
circumstances.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
how
it
appeals
finally
to
this
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
there
many
principles
of
law
in
which
it's
impossible
for
state
courts
throughout
the
land
to
know
whether
that
law
is
being
violated
or
obeyed
until
after
the
particular
facts
are
brought
to
this
court
to
see
whether
majority
of
them
are
shocked?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
one
difference
between
the
illustration
that
justice
harlan's
suggested
in
this
should
be,
that
here,
not
because
of
any
federal
constitutional
position
that
wholly
a
part
from
it
and
separately
distinct
in
forgetting
one
object
of
this
was
to
convict
the
man
of
a
crime
and
the
illustration
he
gives
except
the
one
to
protect
the
person
and
they
have
a
female
from
a
possible
contamination
in
the
case
of
marriage.
justice
hugo
l.
black
unquestionably,
the
state
might
take
a
man
in
the
point
of
a
gun
and
make
him
testify
and
say
that
they
--
they
become
convinced
he's
innocent
and
they
say
he
stands
up
under
that
most
to
be
appreciated,
but
that
probably
wouldn't
justify
to
being
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
taken
as
a
--
as
a
matter
of
routine?
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
least
these
cases
which
you've
brought
into
the
other
states,
they
have
statutes
in
the
other
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that
--
that
state
must
to
have
a
statute
in
order
to
take
it
down.
