justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
involved
in
taking
the
blood
sample,
just
to
hand
prick
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
do
you
think
the
--
there
is
no
distinction
between
the
stomach
pump
to
extract
the
foreign
substance
which
was
broken.
and
that
what's
involved
in
taking,
however,
many
cc's
were
involved?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
they
take
his
fingerprints
in
this
instance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
they
had
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
feel
the
same
thing
about
the
fingerprints?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
it
positive
in
a
drunkometer,
where
he
had
to
blow
his
breath
into
a
balloon
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
or
not
there
was
a
blood
--
an
alcoholic
content
in
the
blood?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
arrives
that
the
same
man,
doesn't
it,
the
alcoholic
content
of
the
blood?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
distinction
it
draw
is
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
assume
they
do
one
of
these
--
assume
that
it
--
it's
without
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
wouldn't
say
with
force,
he's
told
to
do
it,
he
protest,
but
he
does
find
or
hold
his
breath
into
the
balloon.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
--
let's
supposed
it's
possible
and
i
don't
know
whether
it
is
or
not,
although,
capture
of
breath
of
an
unconscious
man
in
this
balloon
using
the
drunkometer
test,
would
you
say
the
same
situation
is
involved
as
we
have
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
you're
really
saying
it's
a
denial
of
due
process,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
may
be
incriminating
evidence,
but
it
can't
possibly
be
the
evidence,
we'll
then
take
some
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
can
it?
is
it
that
usually
limited
to
testimony
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
many
case
where
identity
is
the
crucial
issue
where
crimes
picture
the
--
you
force
one
to
supply
his
fingerprints
and
they
supply
the
convincing
evidence
and
identification.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
the
same
thing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
you
could
search
for
the
weapon
in
which
the
crime
is
committed
--
proper
search
for
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
person
itself?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
your
state
use
the
drunkometer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
of
course,
actually,
that's
what
the
drunkometer
test
is
except
it
arrives
at
it
by
--
the
test
as
i
understand
it,
the
breath.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
said
that's
what
i
understand
that
drunkometer
test
is
actually
it
arrives
at
the
alcoholic
content
of
the
blood
through
analysis
of
the
breath.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
arrives
with
the
same
result
that
you'd
be
using
with
blood.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
for
the
individual,
isn't
it
a
far
more
unpleasant
experience
to
have
the
stomach
pumped
down
ones
throat
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
it
is
to
have
some
blood
drawn
by
a
hypodermic
needle?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
maybe
--
maybe
five
of
us
fainted
at
the
sight
of
blood,
wouldn't
that
make
a
difference?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
(inaudible),
i
--
my
understanding
of
blood
test
in
paternity
cases
was
that
if
there
is
not
identity
of
type
between
the
child
and
the
putative
father,
that
establishes
or
--
or
nearly
to
establish
unless
medically
that
the
father
--
the
putative
father
could
not
have
been
the
father
of
the
child
and
that
the
other
is
not
true
that
the
fact
that
there
is
identity
or
similarity
of
types
doesn't
establish
that
the
putative
father
is
the
father
nor
can
that
evidence
be
used
against
him,
isn't
that
so
in
your
state?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
the
components
of
the
blood
tests
put
special
emphasis
on
necessity
always
to
have
them
made
by
competent
technician.
it's
not
the
reason
they
might
want
run
into
a
habit
(inaudible)
or
someone
who
--
from
whom
a
blood
test
might
present
the
risk
of
--
areal
contention
to
held
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
your
--
your
state
doesn't
have
any
limitation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
by
regulation
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
while
he
has
control,
the
prosecuting
attorney
of
the
state,
the
prosecuting
attorney,
he
--
he
does
not
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
these
counsels
do
the
same
thing,
the
test
with
drunken
driving?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
which
you
have
no
control
over
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
depends
really
on
scientific
acceptance,
my
understanding
was
that
the
--
is
universal
with
scientific
acceptance
now
with
the
reliability
of
blood
tests
to
determine
alcohol
content
not
necessarily
whether
that
alcohol
content
needs
intoxication
but
rather
but
if
there
was
any
question
about
the
test
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
this,
i
understand
now
that
--
there's
been
lot
of
discouragement
of
the
practices
smuggling
diamonds
by
secreting
them
in
bodily
regions,
the
body
orifices
because
they
got
some
kind
of
machine
now
that
as
you
pass
through
the
isle,
they
can
detect
that
you've
done
that.
and
they
move
in
and
they
extract
the
diamonds
and
then
use
them
against
the
smuggler
to
convict
him
with
smuggling.
would
that
be
within
the
--
the
principle
that
you're
urging
on
us
today?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
seeing
eye,
as
i
understand
it.
you
walk
across
it
and
reveals
everything.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
the
machine
doesn't
do
it
then
they
detect,
as
i
understand
it,
that
you
secreted
these
things
and
then
they
extract
them
from
your
earlobe
or
wherever
you
might
have
them.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
you
think
he
could
make
a
point
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
would
be
an
improper
basis
upon
which
to
convict.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
know
that
it
is.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it's
not
your
case
anyway.
