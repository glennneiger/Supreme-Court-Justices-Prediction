mr.
walter
r.
kegel
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
in
the
discussion
perhaps
there
is
this
one
item
which
has
not
received
as
much
attention
as
it
might
and
that
is
the
point
that
regardless
of
whether
a
given
act
shocks
or
does
not
shock,
of
course,
it
must
be
a
violation
of
some
right.
and
it
does
not
secure
every
shocking
that
encompasses
the
violation
of
a
right,
what
may
be
shocking
to
me
or
to
anyone
else
they'll
still
be
perfectly
within
all
legal
rights.
and
first,
we
must
find
some
basic
right
which
has
been
violated
and
then
determine
whether
that
right
is
so
basic,
so
fundamental
as
to
come
within
due
process
of
law.
before
getting
into
that,
however,
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
violation
of
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendments
for
two
reasons.
first,
because
some
members
of
the
court
believed
that
per
se
they
are
adopted
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
if
there
is
a
violation
of
those
here,
then
there
is
automatically
a
violation
of
due
process.
and
secondly,
i
would
like
to
discuss
them
because
it's
apparently
the
contention
of
petitioner
to
some
extent
that
the
rights
which
are
violated
here
are
akin
to
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendment
violations
if
they're
not
violations
of
those
practices,
sort
of
a
situation
where
a
violation
of
the
fourth
plus
the
fifth
equals
the
violation
of
the
fourteenth
that
apparently
is
the
interpretation
which
petitioner
has
placed
on
the
rochin
case.
as
to
the
supposed
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
i
think
there
are
three
reasons,
basically
why
that
has
not
controlled
here.
in
the
first
place,
the
fourth
amendment
prohibits
only
unreasonable
search
and
seizures.
here,
there
is
no
question,
before
there
was
a
valid
arrest.
where
there
is
a
valid
arrest,
a
reason
for
search
is
permitted
and
here
i
believe
that
with
that
arrest,
the
search
of
petitioner's
body
or
the
blood
is
just
as
valid
as
the
search
of
his
house,
of
his
pockets,
or
of
his
fingers
for
fingerprints.
it
all
--
it
was
back
to
the
same
basic
principle.
historically,
also,
the
privilege
granted
by
the
fourth
amendment
was
not
a
privilege
of
the
person
but
was
a
privilege
of
property
affects
a
man's
home
is
his
castle
and
so
on.
and
furthermore,
there
is
one
additional
reason
why
that
could
not
possibly
apply
here
and
that
is
because
it's
certainly
unreasonable
to
require
more
of
the
states
than
as
required
to
the
federal
government.
and
under
the
weeks
case,
the
evidence,
although
illegally
obtained,
if
we're
worrying
about
search
and
seizures,
only,
would
not
be
excluded
unless
there
was
a
motion
to
suppress.
and
of
course,
here,
there
was
no
motion
to
suppress.
the
only
motions
which
or
the
grounds
of
the
objection
of
the
trial
court
were
solely
on
self
incrimination,
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
were
never
mentioned
until
the
matter
came
up
on
habeas
corpus.
mr.
walter
r.
kegel
no,
sir,
we
do
not.
we've
--
we
have
followed
the
--
we
have
not
followed
the
weeks
case.
mr.
walter
r.
kegel
no,
sir,
we
have
not.
but
the
basis
of
the
rule
has
been
that
the
court
will
not
take
time
out
during
the
trial
of
the
case
to
determine
the
question
on
illegality.
and
certainly,
it
should
be
called
to
the
court's
attention
prior
to
the
trial.
mr.
walter
r.
kegel
perhaps
i'm
getting
out
of
the
record
here
and
i
--
i
know
i
am.
mr.
walter
r.
kegel
your
honor,
i
presume,
even
under
the
doctor
in
the
weeks
case
that
that
were
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court
in
the
federal
proceeding
that
that
would
be
a
reason
for
not
having
a
pretrial
motion
as
long
as
the
motion
was
made,
as
soon
the
facts
were
known.
now,
as
to
the
--
as
to
the
fifth
amendment,
of
course,
it
isn't
applicable
in
itself
to
the
states.
but
in
addition
to
that,
as
far
as
fifth
amendment
itself
is
concerned,
i
think
traditionally,
it
is
limited
to
testimonial
compulsion.
i
think
that
is
the
effect
to
the
ruling
of
this
court
in
united
states
verus
(inaudible)
that
is
certainly
according
to
the
majority
of
the
students
on
the
subject
including
dean
wigmore
as
opposing
counsel
stated
has
been
the
rule
that
it
is
limited
to
testimonial
compulsion
and
it
is
largely
and
these
blood
test
cases,
the
early
ones
particularly,
where
there
have
been
departures
from
that
rule
and
i
think
largely
because
it
was
appealing
amongst
courts
at
least
in
the
early
stages
and
the
development
of
this
scientific
test
of
a
type
of
revulsion
against
it
and
this
of
course
was
before
rochin
and
they
would
look
at
the
possible
means
of
excluding
it
and
the
reasons
for
excluding
it
and
decided
that
they
didn't
want
to
exclude
it
and
either
pick
the
fourth
or
fifth
amendments
usually
the
equivalent
state
constitutions
as
a
means
for
excluding
this
test.
the
texas
case
which
was
cited
by
counsel
for
petitioner
about
the
doctor
versus
state
follows
that.
and
yet,
the
rest
of
the
texas
law
is
practically
uniform
holding
that
the
privilege
of
self
incrimination
does
not
apply
with
anything
except
testimony.
mr.
walter
r.
kegel
most
of
them,
your
honor,
that
deny
the
--
the
right
to
take
the
blood
test
while
unconscious
are
of
the
same
type
was
the
iowa
case
which
counsel
discussed.
they
say,
we're
not
going
to
permit
it
and
if
you
want
to
know
why,
look
at
such
and
such
or
we
believe
that
this
is
contrary
to
these
great
principles
which
we
have
long
has
espoused
but
don't
--
significantly
don't
cite
too
many
cases.
there
are,
i
believe,
more
cases
as
far
as
case
law
is
concerned
on
the
side
of
permitting
it.
mr.
justice
douglas
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
--
in
rochin
cited
a
great
number
of
those
cases
together
with
cases
on
other
subjects
which
--
of
compulsion
rather
than
blood
test.
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
question
which
we
have
here
today
is
just
as
open
as
it
was
before
rochin
was
decided.
i
don't
think
that
rochin
controls
the
test
as
justice
frankfurter
stated
in
discussion
that
it
is
--
is
not
a
new
test.
it's
a
question
of
whether
a
right
that's
applied
to
a
given
factual
situation
is
fundamental,
is
something
in
the
words
of
cardozo,
implicit
in
the
concept
of
ordered
liberty,
the
test
which
go
back
to
palko
verus
connecticut
and
snyder
versus
massachusetts.
and
it's
the
contention
of
the
state
of
new
mexico
that
when
you
take
what
is
done
here
and
compare
it
with
certain
rights
which
we've
all
considered
to
be
rather
fundamental
rights
which
this
court
has
said
are
not
embraced
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
are
left
to
the
states
to
decide,
we
feel
that
this
right
to
be
free
from
having
blood
withdrawn
while
unconscious
and
used
in
a
trial
involving
intoxication
to
determine
either
guilt
or
innocence
as
the
test
may
show,
is
not
for
example
as
fundamental
as
the
right
of
trial
by
a
jury.
and
yet,
the
right
of
trial
by
jury
is
not
guaranteed
with
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
say,
also,
it
is
--
it
is
not
as
fundamental
as
the
right
of
testimonial,
the
freedom
from
testimonial
self-incrimination,
which
likewise
this
court
has
said,
is
not
guaranteed.
we
feel
that
in
comparing
these
cases,
which
have
gone
through
and
said
this
is
a
right
which
is
left
to
the
states
to
determine
and
exercise
their
judgement.
but
here,
again,
we
have
another
situation
which
is
in
the
same
category.
we,
likewise,
feel
that
perhaps
or
at
least
we
like
to
be
that
this
case
was
the
case
that
the
court
was
thinking
of
in
the
rochin
case
where
it
exclusive
cases
involving
modern
methergine
devices
for
bringing
wrongdoers
to
justice.
however,
the
state
cases
which
have
been
decided
since
that
time
have
been
very
split
on
whether
that
is
the
case
that
was
being
considered.
mr.
walter
r.
kegel
those
are
he's
--
he's
in
the
penitentiary
at
the
present
time.
he
was
released
on
parole
during
the
pendency
of
--
of
his
petition.
his
parole
was
revoked
and
he's
back
in
the
penitentiary
now.
of
course,
it's
--
it's
not
ultimate
authority
to
say
that
the
large
majority
of
state
courts
uphold
this
type
of
action.
as
been
pointed
out
by
mr.
justice
douglas,
the
majority
of
the
california
highest
court
approved
the
action
in
the
rochin
case.
but
if
rights
are
fundamental
or
must
be
fundamental
in
order
to
be
a
part
of
due
process,
then
the
feeling
of
trial
judges
and
appellate
judges
throughout
the
land
as
to
whether
those
--
whether
a
certain
fact
to
situations
involved
fundamental
rights
is
certainly
as
much
authority
as
a
case
because
these
judges,
like
any
other
court,
are
in
contact
with
the
people
in
our
dispensing
justice
on
a
day
to
day
basis.
and
certainly,
their
feelings
as
to
what
is
fundamental
should
govern
to
some
extent.
we
are
not
here
to
say
that
the
end
justifies
the
means
but
we
do
feel
that
it
is
important
to
point
out
that
in
this
drunken
driving
cases,
these
are
drunken
driving
alone
or
those
involving
deaths
such
as
this
one
that
the
case
of
the
drinking
driver
is
the
greatest
problem
without
doubt
of
law
enforcement
in
the
united
states
today.
both,
as
far
as
number
of
cases
are
concerned,
and
as
far
as
the
ultimate
answer
is
concerned,
the
television
night
before
last
announced
for
example
that
the
national
safety
counsel
estimates
that
4200
people
will
be
killed
in
motor
vehicle
accidents
this
month
alone.
and
there
are
statistics
which
are
published
by
that
same
body
which
indicate
there
are
about
one
out
of
four
of
every
fatal
accidents,
drinking
is
involved
or
the
use
of
toxic.
that,
of
course,
in
and
of
itself
is
not
an
argument,
but
in
these
cases,
the
blood
test
is
of
great
help,
it's
a
great
help
in
determining
innocence
as
well
as
guilt.
and
particularly,
in
this
case,
it
does
not
--
it
doesn't
determine
the
basic
matter
of
guilt
any
more
than
a
finger
print
determines
guilt
in
identification
in
a
case
involving
identity
or
presence.
it
proves
the
fact
or
disapproves
if
that's
--
that's
true.
mr.
walter
r.
kegel
unless
it
might
be
in
the
matter
of
its
taking.
if
it
was
taken
by
an
accepted
method,
i
don't
believe
it
would
make
a
better
difference,
your
honor.
now,
certainly,
we
could
go
on
and
say
that
if
he
used
the
penknife
and
slashed
his
wrist
and
--
and
caught
it
in
a
--
in
a
test
tube
that
that
would
be
brutal
and
it
would
be
shocking
and
it
would
be
beyond
what
he
had
any
right
to
do.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
matter
of
a
lawful
arrest
also
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
this.
we
don't
say
that
you
can
go
down
the
street
and
stop
every
driver
you
see
without
any
cause
and
record
him
to
submit
to
a
blood
test.
i
don't
think
that's
right
and
i
don't
think
it's
anything
which
should
be
condoned
by
this
or
any
other
court
but
in
an
instance
as
where
there
is
enough
evidence
to
permit
the
state
to
make
a
lawful
arrest,
then
i
believe
that
the
blood
test
should
be
allowed.
mr.
walter
r.
kegel
i
--
i
think,
your
honor,
that
in
any
of
these
things
the
--
the
possibility
of
such
is
there.
but
i
do
think
that
there
has
to
be
an
assumption
that
local
law
enforcement
will
operate
at
the
--
at
a
reasonable
level
and
that
these
cases
will
be
handled
in
the
same
manner
in
which
they
have
to
handle
these
facts.
mr.
walter
r.
kegel
i
don't
think
there
are
any,
your
honor,
except
removal
from
office.
mr.
walter
r.
kegel
not
in
new
mexico,
no,
sir.
mr.
walter
r.
kegel
it's
the
practice,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
r.
kegel
yes,
sir
i
can
say
that.
i
could
very
definitely
say
it.
mr.
walter
r.
kegel
i
think
the
--
mr.
walter
r.
kegel
not
from
your
statutory
standpoint,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
r.
kegel
by
regulation
of
state
police
and
local
law
enforcement
agencies,
yes,
sir.
it's
a
--
it's
a
matter
of
a
--
a
very
definite
practice
that
in
all
cases,
these
tests
are
taken
by
a
position?
mr.
walter
r.
kegel
no,
sir,
we
have
not.
mr.
walter
r.
kegel
yes,
sir.
that,
of
course,
i
--i
believe
is
one
reason
that
many
states
have
gone
to
the
drunkometer
test.
that's
mr.
justice
brennan
protest.
that's
much
easier
--
a
much
easier
administration,
no
necessity
of
securing
a
doctor,
an
officer
can
be
trained
in
its
--
in
its
use
in
a
relatively
short
time.
mr.
walter
r.
kegel
the
ones
that
i
have
read,
your
honor,
do
not
quote
statutes
on
that
particular
point.
i
know
that
there
are
statutes
of
varying
types
in
different
states.
for
example,
there
is
a
--
a
statute
which
has
been
adopted
by
some
states
which
sets
up
the
amount
of
alcohol
which
may
be
found
--
mr.
walter
r.
kegel
i
don't
know
that
the
statute
goes
any
further
than
that.
i
believe
arizona
has
that
--
that
statute
which
sets
up
a
statutory
presumption
of
intoxication
if
so
much
alcohol
is
found
in
the
system.
but
as
far
as
the
mechanics
of
the
matter
being
regulated
by
statute,
i'm
not
familiar
with
any
state
that
so
regulates
it.
mr.
walter
r.
kegel
your
honor,
of
course,
we
have
the
problem
of
the
state
police
and
the
local
law
enforcement
agencies,
and
now,
as
far
as
the
state
police
are
concerned,
they
attempt
to
take
--
to
secure
a
blood
test
or
your
analysis
in
all
drunken
driving
cases.
now,
perhaps,
if
we
have
a
situation
where
a
man
is
obviously
dead
drunk
and
there
are
10
witnesses
around,
they
may
not.
but
in
the
normal
case,
they
will
take
one.
until
this
question
is
decided,
those
tests
are
only
being
taken
by
consent
while
this
case
is
pending
in
this
court.
mr.
walter
r.
kegel
as
far
as
the
local
law
enforcement
is
concerned
in
the
various
municipalities,
it,
of
course,
differs.
some
do,
others
have
no
facilities.
mr.
walter
r.
kegel
i
have
no
knowledge
that
i
can
give
assurances
from
the
past,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
walter
r.
kegel
it
doesn't
have
the
control
that
he
should
have.
it's
noticed
under
direct
control.
it's
a
control
through
the
district
attorney's
with
a
control
over
them
if
they
failed
to
act
its
secondary
control.
mr.
walter
r.
kegel
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
r.
kegel
temporarily
at
least.
mr.
walter
r.
kegel
the
governor
can
also.
mr.
walter
r.
kegel
yes,
sir
and
--
or
at
the
direction
of
the
governor.
of
course
they
--
they
use
the
general
method
with
us,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
they
don't
give
us
enough
money
to
do
it
so
they
have
this
controlled
anyway.
mr.
walter
r.
kegel
it
needs
money
for
investigation
oftentimes.
mr.
walter
r.
kegel
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
r.
kegel

mr.

r.
kegel
no,
sir
we
have
not
but
i
--
i
think
i
can
say
this
that
i
know
of
no
instance
where
such
tests
has
been
taken
except
by
a
doctor
and
some
of
those
where
they
have
no
--
no
medical
facilities,
they
were
doctors
who
were
available
for
that
purpose,
the
urinalysis
test
is
used.
of
course,
there
again,
running
to
the
question
of
contamination
but
that's
the
matter
which
--
as
a
matter
going
to
the
weight
of
the
evidence
in
the
trial
and
certainly
no
one
--
no
one
can
be
heard
by
--
from
a
physical
standpoint.
