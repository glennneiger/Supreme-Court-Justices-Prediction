mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
your
honor.
if
the
court
please,
the
facts
in
this
particular
situation
are
very
simple.
i
think
there's
no
difference
of
opinion
between
petitioner
and
the
state
of
new
mexico
as
to
what
occurred.
it's
only
in
the
law
and
the
interpretation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
applied
to
the
situation
where
we
differ,
stated
very
briefly
the
facts
are
that
in
1951,
petitioner
was
tried
in
the
district
court
of
eddy
county
in
new
mexico,
the
charge
of
involuntary
manslaughter.
this
charge
arose
out
of
an
automobile
accident
which
occurred
some
months
prior
to
the
trial,
petitioner
driving
a
pickup
truck
and
the
truck
collided
with
an
automobile
on
a
highway,
north
carlsbad
in
eddy
county,
new
mexico.
petitioner
was
rendered
unconscious
in
the
accident.
three
persons
in
the
other
car
were
killed.
subsequent
to
the
accident,
the
petitioner
was
taken
to
the
hospital
in
carlsbad
in
his
unconscious
condition.
while
there,
at
the
request
of
a
state
patrolman
approximately
20
cc
of
blood
were
withdrawn
by
the
attending
physician.
the
express
purpose
of
the
withdrawal
of
the
blood,
the
request
by
the
state
patrolman
was,
could
a
blood
test
be
made.
his
doctor
indicated
it
could
be
and
withdrew
the
blood.
subsequently
at
the
trial
of
petitioner
on
the
involuntary
manslaughter
charge,
testimony
was
given
as
to
the
alcoholic
content
of
the
blood.
the
testimony
being
that
it
was
approximately
1700
of
1%
which
in
the
opinion
of
the
expert,
the
doctor
who
made
the
test
indicated
an
intoxicated
condition.
the
petitioners,
then
counsel
objected
to
the
admission
of
such
testimony.
matter
fact,
they
objected
throughout
the
trial
to
testimony
surrounding
the
circumstances
of
taking
the
blood,
the
actual
making
of
the
test
and
the
results
of
that
test
and
the
conclusion
which
the
physician
withdraw
as
to
the
--
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
were
intoxicated
at
the
time
of
the
accident.
over
the
objections
on
constitutional
grounds,
the
testimony
was
admitted.
the
trial
resulted
in
a
finding
by
the
jury,
the
petitioner
was
guilty
as
charged
of
involuntary
manslaughter
and
he
was
subsequently
sentence
to
the
state
penitentiary
for
a
term
of
not
less
than
six
or
more
then
10
years,
which
term
he
is
still
serving.
those
very
briefly
are
the
facts
on
which
the
petitioner
for
certiorari
was
brought,
the
ground
being
the
opinion
of
petitioner
that
those
particular
circumstances,
the
taking
of
the
blood,
the
admission,
the
making
of
the
test,
the
admission
of
the
testimony
and
all
of
the
--
actually,
all
of
the
circumstances
involving
the
blood
test
were
a
depravation
of
liberty
without
due
process
of
law
as
is
prohibited
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
the
major
decision
of
this
court
on
which
petitioner
basis
his
claim
is
the
rochin
decision,
rochin
versus
california,
342
u.s.,
in
which
the
question
arose
as
to
whether
or
not
the
forcible
extraction
of
capsules
from
the
stomach
of
--
of
suspected
narcotic
user
or
possessor
in
that
case
by
a
position
following
an
initial
struggle
when
the
arresting
officers
broke
into
the
room,
the
swallowing
of
the
capsules,
the
petitioner
was
then
taken
to
the
hospital
and
a
medic
was
administrated,
stomach
pump
was
used
and
finally,
the
evidence
was
produced.
in
that,
as
the
court
is
aware,
it
was
held
that
the
particular
methods
employed
to
produce
the
evidence
and
the
use
of
them
at
the
trial
involved
a
violation
of
due
process.
the
particular
situation
in
the
instant
case
is
not
to
bark
in
the
petitioner's
opinion
from
--
that
of
the
rochin
case,
rather
there's
no
struggle
or
could
be
no
struggle.
the
man
was
unconscious
when
he
was
picked
up
at
the
scene
of
the
accident,
when
he
was
in
the
hospital
when
the
--
when
the
evidence
was
actually
extracted.
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
i
had
commenced
to
explore
the
application
of
the
position
of
this
court
in
rochin
against
california
to
this
particular
situation.
and
as
i
recall,
had
indicated
that
petitioner
sees
no
particular
reason
for
not
applying
the
doctrine
in
the
rochin
case
simply
because,
here,
there
is
no
brutality
for
us.
there
is
no
struggle
to
secure
the
vital
blood
in
this
case
to
be
tested
in
order
to
supply
the
evidence
in
as
much
as
petitioner
was
unconscious
at
the
time.
that
would
appear
to
be
the
--
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
your
honor,
a
hypodermic
in
this
case,
and
usually
a
--
any
where
from
a
few
to
--
in
this
particular
case
according
to
the
testimony
in
this
situation,
20
cc's
approximately
were
extracted.
so
it
does
involve
a
hypodermic.
the
--
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
well,
they
--
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
yes,
the
--
the
extraction
from
the
vein
with
a
needle.
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
no,
it
wouldn't
your
honor.
but
some
of
the
cases
and
some
of
the
statements,
the
decisions
indicate
that
as
little
as
1
or
2
cc's
were
taken.
in
this
particular
situation,
there
was
20
but
it
certainly
makes
no
difference
how
--
how
little
or
how
much.
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
i
think
not,
your
honor,
when
the
purpose
of
extracting
the
man's
blood
is
to
determine
whether
a
foreign
substance,
in
this
instance,
the
alcoholic
content
which
they
think
is
there
and
certainly
the
--
certainly,
the
fact
that
whether
it
was
taken
merely
by
a
print
--
thin
prick
or
a
--
through
the
use
of
a
syringe.
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
they
did
not,
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
nothing
on
the
record
--
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
i
think
the
fingerprint
cases
can
be
distinguished
from
this
situation
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
fingerprints
involve
identification,
almost
invariable.
and
here,
we
are
faced
with
a
situation
where
they
are
trying
to
actually
prove
the
crime.
it
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
matter,
rather
than
merely
identifying
him
or
placing
him
with
the
scene.
sometimes,
of
course,
fingerprints
aren't
even
necessary.
it's
merely
a
matter
of
routine.
but
here,
the
thing
is
conceivably
--
it
could
be
said
to
be
part
of
the
corpus
delicti
with
the
aspect
that
he
was
driving
the
car
that
he
may
have
been
intoxicated,
that
they
must
take
the
blood
or
feel
they
must
to
make
the
test.
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
well,
a
few
drunkometer
cases,
i
have
in
mind
particularly
the
one
recited
in
--
and
quoted
in
my
brief,
state
against
berg
from
arizona
indicate
that
--
that
is
a
not
such
an
invasion
that
would
disturb
the
court.
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
it
does
your
honor,
but
there
are
still
--
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
well,
the
distinction
in
this
situation
would
be,
i
should
think
that
assuming
the
drunkometer
cases
involved
the
question
of
consent.
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
let's
assume
it's
with
force
or
--
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
here,
there
could
be
no
question
of
consent.
you'd
have
to
be
conscious,
i
should
think
although,
i'm
not
too
well
versed
under
drunkometers
or
the
other
test
of
that
type,
but
i
should
think
that
you'd
have
to
be
conscious
for
that
to
be
a
--
a
valid
test.
here,
the
man
is
unconscious.
there
can
be
no
struggle
of
protest,
the
question
of
consent
or
waiver
or
anything.
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
i
think
it
would
be
much
more
akin
to
this
situation
than
those
cases
that
have
arisen
in
the
state
courts
in
new
york
and
arizona
to
i
can
recall
or
the
accused
or
the
potential
accused
was
conscious.
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
the
taking
here
your
honor
or
in
the
drunkometer?
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
well,
the
fact
that
here
is
a
--
here
is
a
person
who
may
have
committed
a
crime.
persons
were
killed
in
the
accident
in
which
he
was
involved.
he
is
brought
to
the
hospital
unconscious.
an
officer
who,
of
course
--
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
i
think
it's
more
than
self
incrimination,
your
honor.
because
in
the
first
instance,
you
have
the
taking
or
you
would
be
supplying
involuntarily,
then
you
have,
after
the
test
and
the
test
meets
--
reveals
what
the
state
hopes
it
will
reveal.
why,
then
it
is
used
over
objection
at
the
trial.
so,
it's
--
it's
more
than
a
--
merely
a
self-incrimination
or
it's
more
than
merely
--
merely
a
search
and
seizure.
because
as
i
indicated,
when
--
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question,
i
think
this
thing
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
matter,
they're
conceivably
could
be
no
conviction,
no
showing
of
involuntary
manslaughter
where
the
court
says,
driving
while
intoxicated
is
an
--
or
the
supreme
court
of
new
mexico
has
said,
driving
while
intoxicated
is
an
element
to
be
considered
in
manslaughter
prosecutions
and
therefore
they
are
--
they're
approving
that
element.
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
assures
a
fair
trial.
he
is
--
should
be
immune.
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
it
is
due
process,
your
honor.
and
it
is
a
denial
of
due
process
in
my
opinion
if
elements
involving
self
incrimination,
involving
search
and
seizure
enter
into
the
thing,
whether
you
can
say
it's
a
pure
unlawful
search
and
seizure
or
a
pure
violation
of
the
privilege
against
self
incrimination.
i
mean,
they
were
getting
in
the
real
evidence
and
--
and
testimonial
evidence
and
so
forth.
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
i
am
your
honor,
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
that
is
correct
your
honor,
if
it
were
not
a
denial
of
due
process
under
the
fourteenth,
they
couldn't
be
here
and
i
assume
the
court
would've
denied
certiorari.
i
didn't
think
that
was
a
possibility.
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
well,
that's
the
distinction
that
many
of
the
state
courts
have
made
in
such
situations.
and
of
course
dean
wigmore
favors
that,
but
on
the
other
hand,
we
are
now
getting
back
to
one
of
the
features
of
the
rochin
case
which
i
had
intended
to
touch
on.
now
is
a
good
time,
since
your
honor
has
brought
it
up.
the
fact
that,
here,
you
have
evidence
that
is
obtained
in
the
way
it
is
that
you
can
say
--
you
can't
say,
of
course,
that
this
is
compelled
testimony
on
that
part
of
the
accused
because
it's
not.
he
doesn't
--
he
doesn't
testify
at
the
trial
but
he
supplies
the
evidence
or
he
supplies
the
basis
of
that
evidence,
certainly
involuntary
because
he's
unconscious
and
the
scientific
test
were
performed.
and
i
see
little
difference
between
taking
that
from
him
when
he
is
absolutely
unable
to
protest
and
then
drawing
the
scientific
conclusions
in
making
the
testimony
and
--
and
forcing
a
confession.
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
it's
more
--
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
it's
--
it's
more
than
identity.
it's
part
of
the
fact,
i
mean,
in
the
case
of
the
fingerprints,
i
assume
that
you
would
have
a
crime
and
you'd
have
a
corpus
delicti,
you
would
have
the
fingerprints
to
connect
the
man
with
the
scene
of
the
crime.
and
there's
--
there's
no
question
here
but
that
the
man
was
at
the
scene
of
the
crime
that
the
accident
occurred
and
the
state
endeavors
to
show
that
in
the
accident
in
which
he
was
involved,
he
was
driving
while
intoxicated.
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
i'd
say
not
--
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
well,
they
certainly
take
it
over
a
protest,
now
whether
--(voice
overlap)
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
i
think
that
makes
it
even
more
apprehensible.
i
do
think,
your
honor,
that
perhaps
there
shouldn't
be
a
matter
of
degree
of
such
situations,
i
mean
if
he's
perfectly
conscious,
he
knows
what
he's
doing,
sits
passively
by
and
says
nothing.
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
and
nobody
says
anything
--
though
i
--
i
realize
why
conceivably,
he
shouldn't
be
heard
to
complain
later.
although,
there
could
be
an
argument
there,
they
should
have
been
advised.
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
but
if
he
does
protest
without
a
struggle,
then
we're
--
we're
certainly
getting
into
the
field
where
his
rights
are
being
invaded.
if
he
can't
protest,
then
i
would
say
--
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
because
of
the
unconscious
condition.
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
well,
as
i
indicated
a
moment
ago,
i
--
question
whether
there
should
be
a
matter
of
degree
where
there
is
any
taking
without
consent
but
possibly
if
there'd
been
a
struggle
and
he's
been
pinned
down
or
--or
strapped
to
the
table
or
something
and
the
blood
extracted,
why
you
--
you
can
say
that
was
more
reprehensible.
but
on
the
other
hand,
if
there
can
be
no
struggle
--
if
there
can
be
consent,
if
there
can
be
no
way
where
--
because
of
his
condition,
because
of
the
fact
that
he
was
injured
in
the
accident
and
unconscious
for
hours
or
days.
i
--
it
seems
to
me
that
on
that
particular
situation,
which
is
what
we
are
--
been
trying
to
do
it
here.
i
--
it
is
a
denial
of
due
process
to
use
such
evidence
in
the
conviction.
the
state
cases
are
not
too
many
which
have
dealt
with
this
particular
question.
the
iowa
case
of
state
against
weltha
was
almost
identical
on
the
facts
in
that
particular
case.
the
decision
doesn't
indicate
the
exact
ground
for
the
iowa
supreme
court's
holding
that
the
evidence
was
inadmissible
and
reversing
this
conviction
that
indicates
that
the
court
has
read
a
number
of
annotations
in
alr
and
--
and
lawyer's
tradition
on
to
the
supreme
court
--
courts
and
that's
a
1940
cases,
as
i
recall,
and
that
because
of
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
against
lefkowitz
which
was
a
federal
case,
which
involved
in
unlawful
search
and
seizure
and
in
which
the
court
found
violation
of
both
fourth
and
fifth
amendments
that
as
far
as
the
iowa
court
is
concerned,
that
settles.
they
merely
say
that
this
evidence
should
have
been
admitted
that
--
if
anybody
wonders
why
we
think
so
they
can
read
the
lefkowitz
case
and
the
annotations.
so,
it
--
although
it
stands
for
the
proposition
against
iowa
at
least
in
1940,
such
a
conviction
would
be
reversed.
if
it's
not
of
any
great
aid
in
spelling
out
why,
in
fact,
the
iowa
court
without
citing
the
case
had
the
exclusionary
rule
announced
in
the
state
against
(inaudible)
some
years
prior
thereto
that
any
evidence
that
pertain
through
violations
of
the
constitutional
rights
should
be
excluded.
but
the
court
doesn't
cite
that
in
this
weltha
and
the
automobile
case
involving
the
blood
test.
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
no
your
honor,
i
do
not.
that's
--
not
very
many,
so
far
as
i
know
but
i
am
going
into
that.
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
i
believe
those
and
i
think
there
are
very
few
who
actually
have
it
but
those
who
have
it
would
put
it
on
the
theory
that
if
you're
driving
on
the
highway,
you
implied
that
the
consent
to
a
blood
--
to
a
blood
test
in
such
a
situation,
but
i
don't
know
how
many
have
it.
i
know
it
was
considered
in
new
mexico
several
legislatures
ago
and
nothing
came
of
it.
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
yes,
the
attending
physician
at
the
hospital
in
the
(inaudible)
made
the
extraction.
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
no,
the
--
a
certain
--
oh
there
was
a
certain
exploration
of
the
actual
testing
method
employed
to
test
the
blood,
but
as
to
the
taking,
i
don't
recall
a
testimony
shows
there
is
any.
in
the
physician-patient
privilege
which
generally
comes
up
in
these
cases
may
have
been
mentioned
but
it
certainly
wasn't
pressed.
another
state
decision
which
involves,
not
a
blood
test
but
several
other
test
which
were
compelled,
the
walking
of
the
line,
the
urinalysis
for
intoxification
or
--
or
at
least
for
alcoholic
content
was
stating
(inaudible)
from
texas.
and
there,
on
the
grounds
of
self
incrimination
under
the
texas
state
constitution,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
reversed
the
conviction
holding
that
it
was
a
violation
in
the
state
constitution
without
getting
into
a
federal
question
of
law.
one
other
state
court
decision
which
might
be
mentioned
particularly
or
the
consent
involved
is
that
cited
in
the
brief
for
the
respondents
which
is
--
states
against
cram
from
oregon.
and
in
that
particular
case,
we
had
identical
facts
for
the
present
case,
the
conviction
was
upheld
on
the
grounds
that
it
did
not
violate
the
self
incrimination
provision
of
the
state
statute
but
the
court
very
carefully
and
stoutly
avoided,
in
fact,
pointed
out
that
they
were
not
ruling
since
the
question
wasn't
raised
and
whether
or
not
this
was
a
violation
of
the
search
and
seizure
provision.
and
in
the
dissent
by
the
chief
justice
of
the
oregon
supreme
court,
he
indicates
following
and
using,
employing
much
of
the
language
in
palko
that
he
feels
this
is
a
violation
of
due
process
that
the
court
should
have
gone
into
whether
or
not
this
was
an
unlawful
search
and
seizure,
whether
it
was
raised
or
not.
and
the
language
of
that
case,
the
feeling
in
that
case
where
the
facts,
the
manner
of
the
taking
was
--
was
identical
with
that
here
present.
the
language
in
the
dissent
and
occasionally,
the
--
the
sense
of
one
generation
become
the
opinions
of
the
next.
the
language
of
that
dissent
was
very
similar
to
in
thought
and
in
feeling
to
that
of
the
majority
of
this
court
in
the
rochin
case.
to
summarize
the
major
point
course
is,
that
the
taking
and
the
use
of
the
evidence
obtained
from
the
taking
offends
the
civilized
methods
of
decency
in
fair
concepts
of
decency
in
fairness,
and
there's
a
violation
of
due
process
and
conviction
so
obtain
should
not
stay.
it
must
be
and
should
be
like
into
the
course
of
confession
situations.
it
must
be
distinguished
from
the
mere
fingerprint
decisions
of
the
cases
that
hold
it.
you
can
compel
a
defendant
to
stand
in
court
or
speak
or
even
walk
for
the
simple
reason
that
this
is
more
question
of
mere
identity
you're
placing
in
the
scene
of
the
crime.
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
well,
the
whole
case
as
i
recall
--
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
some
says
this
distinction
has
been
made,
your
honor,
of
course
the
--
the
old
case
indicates
apparently
that
he
can
be
made
to
trial
and
quote,
but
there
again,
there's
--
he
may
be
compelled
to
perform
an
act
which
like
linked
him
with
the
crime.
there
again,
the
distinction
would
appear
to
be
that
here,
what's
done
--
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
but
that
would
not
convey
the
person.
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
if
the
court
please.
one
or
two
points,
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
whether
these
tests
were
accepted
medically
in
the
part
of
the
record
which
we
had
printed
in,
sometimes,
i
think,
perhaps
i
should
have
had
the
whole
thing
credit.
i
will
get
to
the
reason
for
that
in
a
second.
it
does
indicate
that
there
was,
of
course,
cross-examination
on
the
--
of
the
doctor
although
there
was
no
evidence
as
to
whether
the
thing
was
reliable
other
than
it
was
done
through
cross-examination.
it
does
indicate
that
there
are
different
standards,
which
are
applied
and
further
and
this
of
course
is
explored
to
a
considerable
extent
in
law
review
articles
and
in
that
journal
of
criminology
and
criminal
law.
there
--
the
--
there's
this
--
there's
a
tolerance,
there's
his
own
tolerance,
their
individual
differences,
of
course,
well
that
was
raised
on
cross-examination
and
the
doctor
of
course
said
sure
some
people
are
tolerant
--
more
tolerant
than
others.
and
in
this
situation,
the
--
although
this
was
not
--
this
of
course
is
not
our
major
--
our
major
point,
i
think,
it
--
it
is
something
to
be
considered
to
whether
these
tests
are
reliable
enough
to
be
accepted
by
the
courts,
they've
been
accepted
by
the
state
courts
in
some
states,
whether
they
are
reliable
or
not,
and
if
they
are,
why
then
of
course
next
will
be
based
with
whether
sodium
pentothal,
sodium
amytal,
et
cetera
is
also
a
reliable
source
of
--
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
your
honor,
there's
one
--
there's
one
article
and
i
--
i
don't
have
the
--
i
have
actually
gone
into
this
for
sometime
and
i
did
it
in
connection
with
another
case.
i
didn't
feel
it
was
of
overwhelming
--
overwhelming
importance
here.
there's
one
article
in
the
journal
of
criminal
law
and
criminology
which
indicates
that
this
type
of
test
and
others
that
are
employed
is
--
are
not
as
satisfactory
as
this
final
puncture
in
order
to
get
a
true
test
of
alcoholic
content,
in
order
to
get
the
alcoholic
content
of
the
blood
in
the
brain.
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
oh
i
realize
--
i
realized
that
your
honor.
i
mean,
there's
--
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
that
is
correct,
but
i
mean
that
particular
article
says
that
merely
taking
it
from
the
arms
--
secondary
evidence
practically
in
that
writer's
viewpoint.
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
is
that
machine
--
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
i
don't
know
your
honor.
i
have
to
know
more
about
how
the
thing
works.
that's
a
--
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
well
now,
if
a
man
walks
into
a
prison
with
a
gun
concealed
on
his
person
and
that
is
revealed
through
the
usual
devices
there
and
the
thing
is
taken
from
him
and
he's
subsequently
prosecuted
for
carrying
a
concealed
weapon,
i
suppose
he
could
raise
some
point
there.
he's
violated
a
couple
of
laws.
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
i
think
perhaps
he
could.
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
securing
the
--
that's
very
hypothetical.
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
the
--
well,
i'm
not
aware
that
it
has
happened.
mr.
f.
gordon
shermack
that's
right.
the
reason
why
i
mentioned
i
wish
i
brought
up
the
entire
record
is
the
attorney
general,
both
mr.
robinson
and
his
assistant
mr.
kegel,
have
mentioned
a
legal
arrest.
well,
first
of
all,
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
whether
there's
illegal
arrest
in
a
situation
like
this.
if
you
have
one
that
goes
--
if
you
have
a
situation
that
is
such
that
the
evidence
was
secured
in
the
--
a
man's
due
process
has
been
violated
with
differences
and
in
the
second
place
as
far
as
i
can
recall
from
the
record,
there's
nothing
in
there,
one
way
or
the
other,
to
reveal
that
there
was
an
arrest,
that
the
man
was
of
course
unconscious
that's
shown
by
the
parts
of
the
record
that
had
been
printed,
but
there's
nothing
in
--
and
he
was
unconscious
at
the
time
he
was
picked
up
at
the
accident.
there's
nothing
to
show
an
arrest
that
he
was
under
arrest
at
the
time
of
the
taking
of
the
blood.
as
i
indicated,
i
don't
think
that's
important
and
there
are
one
or
two
state
cases
that
(inaudible)
on
that.
but
in
this
particular
case,
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
arrest
at
that
time.
