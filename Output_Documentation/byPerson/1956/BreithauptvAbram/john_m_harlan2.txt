supposing
this
man
had
been
conscious
and
the
police
officer
would
say
we
want
to
take
a
blood
test
and
he
said
i
don't
want
to,
he
don't
want
it,
i
won't
allow
you
to
do
it,
obviously
i'm
not
under
--
resist
--
resist
you
and
--
would
that
make
any
difference?
they
take
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
--
protest
without
a
physical
scratch,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at.
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
you
rely
on
the
fact
that
this
man's
unconscious,
is
that
what
makes
you
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
i'm
not
saying
any
attempt
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
i'm
trying
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
you've
got
an
easier
case
because
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
--
is
that
your
point?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
know
how
many
states
who
got
this
blood
test
statutes?
justice
john
m.
harlan
instantly,
i
gather
that
the
--
was
--
did
the
doctor
make
this
instruction?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
there's
no
suggestion
that
the
technique
he
employed
was
different
from
what
or
would
have
been
at
the
accused,
the
conscious
and
consented.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
you
spell
that
again
please.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
any
doubt
that
as
to
the
--
as
to
the
scientific
accuracy
of
this
blood
test?
i
mean
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
they're
not
like
the
lie
detector.
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
opposition
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
in
any
matter,
they
are
accepted
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
are
some
of
the
other
fields
on
your
state
where
blood
test
are
required
to
people
who
get
married
in
your
state?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
mean,
another
states,
of
course,
a
person
going
into
the
army,
the
fact
that
he
had
the
blood
test
and
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
is
the
status
of
this
defendant
now?
is
he
in
jail
or
does
he
serve
his
sentence?
