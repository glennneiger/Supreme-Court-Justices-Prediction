mr.
richard
h.
robinson
with
the
court's
permission,
i
intend
to
attempt
to
convince
this
honorable
body
that
in
case
at
bar
is
not
similar
and
should
be
distinguished
from
the
rochin
case
which
the
petitioner
has
more
or
less
hung
his
head
on
and
with
the
further
permission
of
the
court,
assistant
attorney
general
kegel
will
discuss
the
applicability
or
the
lack
of
applicability
of
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendments
which
has
been
mentioned
briefly
by
petitioner's
counsel.
i
intend
to
use
less
than
half
of
the
time
then
give
mr.
kegel
the
balance.
in
the
rochin
case,
the
opinion
was
written
by
the
honorable
justice
frankfurter
and
one
of
the
questions
he
asked
in
there
was
that
had
to
be
determined
was
whether
or
not
the
actions
in
the
rochin
case
and
to
refresh
the
court's
memory
briefly,
there,
the
officers
had
forced
themselves
into
the
home
of
the
defendant,
forced
their
way
into
his
bedroom,
saw
these
capsules
of
dope
laying
on
the
table,
that's
what
they
were.
the
defendant
quickly
swallowed
them
then
attempted
right
there
to
force
the
capsules
from
his
mouth
and
enable
to
do
so,
they
handcuffed
him,
dragged
him
down
to
a
hospital,
forced
the
medicine
to
his
stomach
and
caused
him
to
regurgitate,
we
covered
that
evidence
which
was
used
against
him.
and
one
of
the
questions
justice
frankfurter
asked
was
whether
or
not
such
actions
offend
the
counts
of
decency
and
fairness
which
he
expressed
the
notions
of
justice
of
english
speaking
people,
even
toward
those
charges
of
the
most
heinous
offenses.
justice
frankfurter
stated
that
these
actions
in
the
rochin
case
certainly
shocked
the
conscience
of
the
court.
in
distinguishing
the
case
at
bar,
i
should
like
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
in
the
rochin
case,
they
started
out
by
an
illegal
breaking
and
entering
of
the
defendant's
home
without
any
type
of
processed
warrant,
whatsoever.
this
does
not
exist
in
the
breithaupt
case.
the
case
is
barred,
there
was
any
struggle
enforcing
--
for
the
body,
dragging
him
against
the
body
and
assault
against
the
body
and
attempted
to
open
his
mouth.
that
does
not
exist
in
the
case
at
bar.
there
was
an
illegal
arrest
made.
they're
not
able
to
obtain
the
capsules,
not
even
be
ensured
they
work
though
--
having
no
actual
reason
to
make
an
arrest,
they
arrested
the
defendant
in
the
rochin
case.
in
this
case,
the
arrest
was
completely
legal.
there
was
an
accident,
crest
of
a
hill
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
road,
as
far
as
the
defendant
was
concerned,
three
limit
women
lay
dead
upon
the
highway.
there
was
an
almost
empty
bottle
of
whiskey
with
the
defendant
on
the
car
and
he
smelled
of
alcohol.
there
was
an
illegal
arrest
in
the
case
at
bar.
there
was
no
brutality
shown
in
the
case
at
bar
as
was
discussed
by
the
honorable
justice
frankfurter
in
the
rochin
case.
in
fact,
he
was
taken
to
the
hospital
and
attempt
to
save
his
life
and
was
kept
there
several
days,
and
as
i
recall,
weeks,
at
the
county
expense
in
attempt
to
save
his
life.
it
would
have
been
impossible
or
had
--
had
any
affect
any
way
to
wait
until
he
could
gain
consciousness
to
give
his
consent
if
it
were
necessary.
the
fact
show
and
the
court's
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
officer
suggested
a
blood
test
and
the
doctor
agreed
to
draw
blood
by
merely
the
small
prick
of
a
needle.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
not
to
my
knowledge,
sir.
we
used
several
different
types
of
tests
but
the
alcohol
--
the
blood
test
is
the
most
common.
and
that's
one
that
was
used
in
this.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
i'm
sorry
sir.
i
didn't
--
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
through
analysis
of
the
breath
rather
than
the
blood,
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
that's
right.
they
have
the
same
result
as
i
understand
it,
your
honor,
and
frankly,
i
can't
seen
any
difference
in
the
drunkometer
whether
we
had
taken
the
breath
of
the
defendant
which
i
believe
is
possible
although
i'm
not
sure
if
he
was
conscious
or
whether
we
took
blood
from
his
veins.
in
the
rochin
case,
as
you
recall,
justice
douglas
and
black
dissented
on
the
ground
to
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendment
be
binding
upon
the
state.
however,
douglas
--
justice
douglas
stated
that
he
did
not
agree,
that
the
exclusionary
rule
adopted
by
large
majority
of
the
states
violates
the
decency
of
civilized
conduct.
the
rules
formulated
by
responsible
courts
with
judges
as
sensitive
--
as
we
are
to
proper
standards
for
all
administration
and
of
the
quote.
and
as
the
court
has
been
informed,
the
state
of
new
mexico
has
adopted
--
does
not
exclude
the
illegally
obtained
evidence
or
testimony.
it
may
be
used
regardless
of
the
procedure
which
was
employed
in
requiring
the
evidence.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
yes,
sir,
conscientiously
i
could,
in
my
own
mind,
distinguish
the
cases
because
the
lack
of
brutality,
the
lack
of
the
illegal
arrest
and
it
was
in
the
rochin
case
the
stomach
or
pump
test
was
preceded
by
any
illegal
arrest.
it
was
--
the
illegal
arrest
was
preceded
by
an
illegal
force
in
entering
without
a
warrant
and
if
the
rochin
case,
and
it
is
the
law
of
the
land
at
this
time,
and
if
it
is
to
remain
the
law
of
the
land,
i
should
certainly
say
that
the
actions
in
the
rochin
case
would
shock
the
conscience
of
the
court,
where,
even
in
your
hypothetical
case
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
illegal
arrest
is
lacking,
the
illegal
force
in
entering
to
the
home
is
lacking
and
i
think
the
cases
could
be
distinguished,
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
i
think
that
makes
some
difference,
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
in
deciding
where
the
line
is,
where
the
cases
start
to
shock
the
court
and
where
they
don't,
you
have
to
consider
all
these
elements.
now,
under
the
wolf
case,
it
would
--
the
wolf
case,
as
you
recall,
stated
in
the
weeks
case,
did
--
did
not
apply
to
the
state
courts
and
they
could
have
meet
this
evidence
as
their
rules
of
evidence
so
provided.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
let
me
answer
that,
if
i
may,
sir,
this
way,
i
still
don't
think
that
that
type
of
action
would
be
so
shocking
as
the
rochin
case.
and
in
the
rochin,
as
i
say
in
--
in
the
further
developing
and
studying
of
the
rochin
case,
the
(inaudible)
case
that
you
have
to
decide,
possibly,
at
the
trial,
the
attorney
on
the
case
arbitrarily
whether
or
not
this
is
going
far
enough
to
shock
the
conscience
of
the
court,
but
in
answering
your
question,
let's
say
that
new
mexico
had
had
a
compulsory
law
requiring
blood
test
for
drunken
driving
cases.
it
has
been
mentioned
on
the
legislature
some
years
passed,
and
in
my
understanding,
it's
going
to
be
brought
up
again
this
january
in
the
legislature.
but
if
such
an
act
would
shock
the
conscience
of
the
court,
such
a
law
should
also
shock
the
conscience
of
the
court
and
i
don't
think
those
laws
have
been
held
to
shock
the
conscience
of
the
court.
but
we
had
a
law
requiring
a
drunken
driving
--
the
suspect
to
submit
the
blood
test,
we
could
do
it
even
by
force
and
i
don't
believe
that
would
shock
the
conscience
of
the
court
under
the
rochin
case.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
yes,
sir.
it
would
change
the
degree
of
--
as
i
say,
the
shock
upon
the
court.
somewhere
in
that
field,
you
got
to
draw
a
line
in
where
they
start
to
shock
the
court.
and
i
think
it
would
put
it
certainly
over
on
that
side
of
that
dividing
line,
if
i
may
express
it
that
way.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
no,
sir.
at
least,
i
could
find
--
i
could
just
find
no
authority
saying
it
does.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
no,
sir.
i
--
my
own
personal
feeling
is,
that
i
and
justice
clark
so
stated
in
the
irvine
case,
i
believe
it
was,
that
if
the
wolf
case
is
to
be
the
law
of
the
land
as
it
had
been
for
years
and
it
should
be
the
law
all
the
way
and
that
the
states
should
provide
protection
for
violations
of
the
self
incrimination
--
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
that's
right,
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
well
that
--
that's
what
the
court
has
done,
as
i
understand
it,
in
the
rochin
case.
so
that's
why
--
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
that's
right
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
that's
right,
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
that's
my
purposes
to
try
to
distinguish
the
rochin
case
from
this
case
and
--
and
convinced
the
court,
if
i
can,
that
the
due
process
clause
has
not
been
violated.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
i
--
i
didn't
understand
the
chief
justice's
question
to
involve
a
struggle.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
there
was
a
verbal
protest,
i
believe,
in
his
hypothetical
case,
but
no
--
no
struggle.
and
to
answer
your
question,
as
i
say,
it
would
be
--
it
would
--
i
--
in
the
case
of
a
struggle,
it
would
increase
the
degree
of
work
to
the
--
to
the
point
that
might
shock
the
conscience
of
the
court,
i
agree
to
that.
but
the
rochin
case,
in
addition
to
a
struggle
was
surely
illegal
breaking
and
entering
to
the
home,
the
illegal
arrest,
and
the
brutality
shown
all
the
way
through
it
where
you
don't
have
it
in
this
case
and
you'd
only
have
a
--
a
lesser
degree
of
it
in
your
hypothetical
case.
you'd
have
the
lesser
degree
of
brutality
in
the
temporary
struggle
or
however
long
it
might
last
in
forcing
the
stomach
pump.but
you
still
wouldn't
go
as
far
as
the
fact
showed
in
the
rochin
case.
and
of
course,
it's
entirely
up
to
the
court
to
decide
where
the
field
starts
in
this
due
process
cases
in
this
type
of
arrest
where
it
starts
to
shock
the
court
and
where
it
doesn't.
and
in
your
case,
you
would
certainly
be
closer
to
the
rochin
case
but
you
still
wouldn't
involve
the
illegal
arrest
and
the
illegal
search
as
the
illegal
force
entry
to
the
--
to
the
home.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
that's
right.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
yes,
sir,
i
know.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
well,
the
--
i
might
recall
to
the
court
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
mexico,
the
five
justices
thereon
considered
this
case,
the
facts
in
the
case
at
bar
after
the
rochin
case.
and
they
apparently
didn't
feel
that
this
action
was
a
vision
to
shock
the
conscience
of
that
particular
court.
in
--
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
if
it
--
no,
it
certainly
didn't
sir,
all
the
way
up
to
the
california
courts,
it
didn't.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
that's
right,
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
that's
right.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
yes,
your
honor.
when
i
said
the
court,
i
meant
the
majority
of
this
particular
issue.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
yes.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
well,
i
frankly
mentioned
the
new
mexico
case
and
actually
hoping
they
would
have
some
influence
on
the
court,
the
fact
there
are
five
members
and
some
of
them
fairly
sensed
the
--
yes
it
was
unanimous
opinion.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
that's
right.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
that's
the
rochin
case.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
well,
that's
why
in
the
rochin
case,
as
i
recall,
it
was
a
five-to-four
decision
written
by
yourself,
your
honor,
and
that's
why
i
--
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
they
certainly
have
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
you're
right,
sir.
now,
in
the
haeussler
case,
haeussler
versus
california,
260
p.2d,
page
8,
was
a
case
directly
in
point
with
the
breithaupt
case,
the
case
at
bar
where
blood
was
taken
from
an
unconscious
woman.
and
the
court
discussed
the
rochin
case
which
stated
that
they
did
not
feel
that
the
facts
in
the
haeussler
case
were
sufficient
to
be
shocking
to
the
court.
of
course,
i
refer
to
the
supreme
court
of
california
and
not
to
this
court.
they
went
on
the
state
but
this
was
a
taking
of
real
evidence
rather
than
testimonial
compulsion.
this
people
versus
cahan,
282
p.2d
905,
state
of
california
changed
the
rule
of
evidence
in
california.
it
did
not
overrule
the
haeussler
case
but
it
changed
the
rule
of
evidence
and
stated
that
illegally
obtained
testimony
would
no
longer
be
admissible
in
the
state
of
california
because
the
court
well
know
is
that
--
is
the
minority
rule
throughout
the
united
states
and
as
far
as
the
states
are
concerned.
the
--
a
district
court
case
in
the
third
appellate
district
of
california,
people
versus
paul
j.
duroncelay,
d-u-r-o-n-c-e-l-a-y,
only
decided
last
month
and
only
have
advanced
sheets
on
it,
discussed
the
cahan
case
and
stated
because
i
have
already
that
it
merely
changed
the
rule
of
evidence
in
california.
and
in
this
case,
it
was
also
the
taking
of
blood
in
a
dwi
case
and
driving
under
the
influence
case
and
there
were
some
evidence
although
it
was
indefinite
that
it
was
--
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
yes,
sir.
that's
right,
sir.
that's
282
p.2d
905
--
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
--
decided
in
april
of
1957.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
no,
sir.
that
was
an
illegal
entry
in
the
home
to
get
evidence
on
a
bookmaking
case,
your
honor.
however,
in
this
last
case,
i've
just
discussed
in
the
third
appellate
district
of
california,
it
was
a
blood
taking
case
and
there
were
some
evidence
that
was
taken
under
protest.
at
least,
he
withdrew
his
arm
and
they
forced
his
arm
back
and
took
it.
and
they
held
that
even
though
the
cahan
case
now
is
a
law
that
this
was
an
illegal
taking
and
that
the
--
and
the
conviction
was
upheld.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
no,
sir,
i
didn't.
it
was
one
that
just
was
mailed
to
me
recently.
it's
a
district
court
case,
a
third
appellate
district
of
california
and
it's
only
have
the
advanced
sheets
on
it,
sir
and
just
decided
last
month.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
it's
a
--
the
people
of
state
of
california
versus
paul
j.
duroncelay,
d-u-r-o-n-c-e-l-a-y.

criminal
action
number
2672
in
the
third
appellate

mr.
richard
h.
robinson
well,
just
the
act
itself,
if
done
by
force
is
more
shocking
to
me,
your
honor.
as
justice
brennan
--
mr.

well,
--
mr.
richard

the
physical

pump
down
a
man's
throat
just
in
itself,
the
latter
is
more
shocking
to
me.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
that's
right.
it's
more
unpleasant,
it
takes
more
force.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
i
know
sir.
i've
seen
evidence
of
that
sir.
but
just
the
act
itself,
justice
black,
to
me
is
--
is
--it's
at
least
more
unpleasant
as
you
say
and
more
shocking.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
that's
right,
yes,
sir.
and
--
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
it
goes
again
into
that
degree
of
how
far
you
must
shock
the
conscience
of
the
majority
of
this
court
before
due
process
is
violated.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
certainly,
as
for
me
--
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
it
certainly
is
for
me
sir.
as
you
indicated
there's
a
--
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
well,
i
will
admit
i
have
seen
the
former
happened
but
i've
never
seen
anybody
swallow
a
pump
with
ease
sir.
but
it
goes
into
that
degree
against
--
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
my
brief
experience
with
the
stomach
pump,
i
would
feel
that
way,
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
i
don't'
know
sir
and
that's
--
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
that's
--
i
think
that's
a
problem
with
the
court
as
justice
frankfurter
has
indicated,
five
of
you
are
going
to
have
to
agree
one
way
or
the
other,
so
whether
you're
shocked
sufficiently
to
feel
that
the
due
process
well
had
been
violated.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
that
would
have
a
great
deal
of
effect
on
your
decision.
i'm
sure
of
it
--
i'm
sure
of
that
justice.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
i
think
you
only
have
to
search
your
own
conscience,
your
honor,
and
see
if
you
feel
the
degree
of
shock
is
sufficient
that
the
due
process
clause
had
been
violated.
that's
the
only
answer
that
i
could
honestly
give.
and
i'm
trying
to
convince
the
court,
at
least
five
of
you,
that
the
facts
in
the
breithaupt
case
aren't
sufficient
to
shock
the
conscience
of
the
court
and
that's
why
i'm
bringing
up
this
lower
court
cases
to
show
that
even
after
the
rochin
case,
the
lower
courts
have
not
been
so
shocked.
even
though
they
--
some
of
them
discussed
and
agree
with
the
rochin
case,
even
if
the
--
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
i
think
it
would,
yes,
sir.
it
would
have
--
it
would
have
something
to
say
in
how
far
to
the
right
of
this
middle
line
i
have
arbitrarily
drawn
where
the
shocking
cases
started.
it
would
have
again
to
do
with
the
degree
of
shock
in
--
in
my
opinion.
how
much
force
was
used?
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
i
don't
see
how
they
could
set
up
arbitary
standards,
no,
sir.
that's
the
reason
we're
here.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
that's
the
reason
we're
here
now
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
that's
right,
sir.
and
that's
why
we're
here
today
because
it's
impossible
to
setup
standards
to
go
by
and
that's
why
i'm
here
trying
to
convince
the
court
that
this
isn't
shocking
in
my
opinion
and
the
lower
court's
opinion.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
i
wish
i
could
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
i
don't
know
of
any,
no,
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
no,
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
i
realize
that's
been
--
that's
--
that's
why
i'm
here
realizing
the
--
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
no,
realizing
that
the
rochin
case
of
the
law
of
the
land
and
trying
to
convince
this
honorable
court
that
the
breithaupt
case,
in
fact,
should
not
shock
the
conscience
of
this
court.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
they
are
almost
wholly
accepted
into
evidence,
your
honor,
this
--
this
type
of
test.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
no,
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
no,
sir.
they
are
--
they
are
accepted
in
the
--
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
medically,
in
--
in
every
case
that
i
ran
into,
i
run
into
old
cases
where
a
properly
taken
blood
test
was
not
admitted
as
far
as
its
action
is
concerned.
to
conclude,
i'd
like
to
discuss
briefly,
i
mentioned
mr.
clark's
opinion
in
the
irvine
case,
but
the
irvine
versus
california,
347
united
states
128,
decided
february
the
8th,
1954.
in
that
case,
an
officer
had
the
key
made
to
the
defendant's
home
without
the
defendant's
knowledge,
used
it
to
enter
his
home
and
placed
the
microphone,
used
it
again
to
change
the
microphone
into
the
privacy
of
the
man's
bedroom,
then
after
being
unsatisfied
there,
he
moved
--
went
into
the
house
again
and
moved
it
under
the
closet.
and
as
i
recall,
some
evidence
was
taken
during
one
of
the
illegal
breaking
and
that
the
testimony
from
the
records
were
used
in
convicting
him
of
bookmaking.
and
one
of
the
points
discussed
by
the
court
--
or
the
--
this
court
was
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
in
its
decision,
the
decision
was
written
by
justice
jackson.
he
accorded
the
wolf
case
and
repeated
that
it
was
still
the
law
that
states
are
not
prohibited
from
admitting
illegally
obtained
evidence.
and
in
discussing
the
rochin
case,
stated
that
in
the
rochin
case,
there
was
coercion,
brutality
and
so
forth.
and
it
did
not
exist
in
the
irvine
case.
and
as
i
say
in
that
case,
justice
clark
wrote
a
concurring
opinion,
but
he
stated
there
he
believed
the
weeks
case
should
apply
to
the
states
but
since
the
court
in
the
wolf
case
held
that
it
didn't,
then
the
court
should
honor
what
they
deemed
to
be
the
law.
i
want
to
mention
that
case
ever
since
it
was
decided
after
the
rochin
case
and
a
majority
of
the
court
held
that
such
facts
do
not
--
did
not
shock
the
conscience
of
the
court.
and
in
my
humble
opinion
sir,
i
think
the
irvine
case
is
much
more
shocking.
you
have
these
degrees
of
being
shocked
again
then
the
case
at
bar.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
no,
sir.
we
have
no
requirement
on
--
to
my
knowledge,
we
have
none,
not
even
on
prenatal,
most
of
them
do
it
voluntary
standard,
the
doctor
requires
it.
as
to
my
knowledge,
we
have
no
statutes
requiring
--
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
and
we
have
mandatory
vaccination
statutes
and
things
like
that,
but
to
my
knowledge,
i
don't
know
of
any
blood
test
that
is
mandatory.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
not
necessarily,
it
doesn't
follow.
i've
read
that.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
that's
right.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
well,
i
agree
--
i
agree
that
it's
for
a
different
purpose.
but
in
this
case,
the
same
evidence
though
could
have
been
used,
had
it
been
a
negative
test
to
prove
his
innocence
and
in
such
a
statute,
i
understand
such
legislation
will
be
hearing
this,
this
time
in
new
mexico.
the
evidence
will
be
used
either
way
to
prove
his
innocence
as
well
as
his
guilt
and
it
could
have
been
possible
in
the
breithaupt
case,
had
been
shown.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
no,
i
agree
it
wouldn't.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
it's
left
up
to
the
expert
testifying
in
each
individual
case,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
that
is
the
general
--
the
general
opinion
at
the
0.15
up,
they
are
under
the
influence
of
the
alcohol.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
yes,
sir,
there
is,
although
it's
generally
accepted.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
0.17.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
there
was
no
testimony
on
the
other
side
that
he
could
have
had
0.17
and
still
not
been
intoxicated.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
that's
right
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
that
is
awfully
close
to
the
rochin
case,
in
my
opinion.
in
your
--
assuming
the
--
the
same
illegal
arrest
and
entrance
so
forth
was
made.
i
think
it's
always
been
--
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
i
think
that
could
be
sustained,
yes,
sir,
under
the
grounds
that
they
are
taking
real
or
you
might
call
it
physical
evidence
rather
than
testimony
of
compulsion.
i
understand,
i
am
not
sure
of
this,
i
didn't
check
that
point
where
they
understand
there
are
some
states
having
statutes
requiring
blood
test
in
paternity
cases.
and
certainly,
such
a
statute
would
be
upheld,
and
i
think
such
action
could
be
sustained
even
under
the
doctor
of
the
rochin
case.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
i'm
not
--
we
have
not
statutes
on
it
and
i'm
not
sure
what
the
supreme
court's
rule
on
this.
mr.
richard
h.
robinson
that
certainly
happened
in
some
field
already.
