please.
mr.
delvaille
h.

this
is
a
disbarment
suit
brought
in
the
federal
court
in
which
i
am,
the
defendant.
i'm
representing
myself.
the
disbarment
suit
in
the
federal
court
was
based
on
a
judgment
of
disbarment
in
the
state
court
in
accordance
with
the
rules
for
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana.
i
would
like
to
go
back
just
a
bit
so
that
your
honors
may
have
a
short
history
of
the
facts
of
this
case.
i
was
admitted
to
practice
in
1910
into
state
law
and
very
shortly
thereafter,
in
the
federal
court.
i
practiced
law
from
1910
until
1936
quite
actively.
i
also
undertook
the
other
matters
in
line
with
my
professional
duties.
i
was
the
editor
of
the
southern
law
quarterly
printed
by
and
published
by
tulane
university
which
came
to
an
end
at
the
beginning
of
the
first
world
war.
and
subsequently,
after
the
first
world
war,
i
became
one
of
the
editors
of
the
southern
law
quarterly
of
tulane
which
is
going
on.
i
taught
at
tulane
university
in
the
law
school,
part
time
as
a
gracious
act
contribution
of
love
for
a
profession
which
i
cherish
without
salary
of
course,
for
16
years.
in
1935,
i
realized
myself
that
my
health
was
impaired.
i
found
it
almost
impossible
to
go
on.
i
have
been
very
active,
trial
work
over
the
years.
i
had
tried
many
cases.
i
couldn't
begin
to
give
you
an
idea
of
how
many.
and
i
had
to
give
up
the
law
school.
i
felt
that
i
couldn't
go
on,
although
it
was
one
of
the
great
things
in
my
life.
in
the
summer
of
1936,
i
collapsed.
there
was
trouble
in
my
business.
there
was
trouble
in
my
affairs,
and
i
was
moved
by
my
family
and
my
friends
to
a
mental
institution.
it
is
a
fact
that
i
remained
there
as
patient
for
more
than
10
years,
seven
years
in
de
paul
sanitarium,
seven
months
in
the
state
institution
for
mentally
afflicted
at
jackson,
louisiana
and
about
three
years
in
the
parish
infirmary
in
the
city
of
new
orleans.
i
received
fine
care,
good
treatment.
i
was
taken
cared
of.
i
myself
reached
the
point
gradually
where
i've
realized
that
i
must
get
well
and
i
wanted
to
get
well
and
that
i
mustn't
hurry
my
cure.
i
reached
the
point
where
some
charges
which
had
been
made
against
me,
there
were
two
charges
that
were
made
against
me
of
mishandling
of
funds,
and
one
of
those
charges
involving
a
large
sum
of
money,
$42,000.
the
district
attorney
and
the
attorney
general
on
the
recommendation
of
a
coroner
and
a
committee
reached
the
conclusion
that
i
was
well
enough
to
be
tried
criminally
for
this
embezzlement
or
alleged
embezzlement.
by
that
time,
i
was
well
enough
to
take
care
of
myself.
by
that
time,
i
was
well
enough
to
go
through
my
records
such
as
they
were
and
particularly
through
my
checks
and
to
assist
the
gentlemen,
my
friends
who
had
finally
consented
to
represent
me
in
that
criminal
prosecution.
and
the
case
was
tried
on
this
charge
of
an
embezzlement
of
$42,000,
tried
to
seven
or
eight
days
before
a
jury
in
the
criminal
court
in
the
parish
of
orleans
where
the
result
with
the
evidence
that
i
was
able
to
offer,
but
i
was
acquitted.
the
result
being
that
i
was
not
guilty,
i
hadn't
taken
the
woman's
money.
instead
of
having
embezzled
$42,000,
she
owed
me
$5,000
in
round
figures
plus
the
interest
that
i
had
paid
her
on
the
money
for
years.
i
had
repaid
the
principal.
immediately,
the
criminal
authorities
undertook
to
bring
up
the
second
suit
which
they
had
allowed
to
remain
dormant
for
these
10
years
and
l
pleaded
prescription
under
the
statute.
and
that
went
to
the
supreme
court
on
the
appeal
of
the
attorney
general,
it
was
a
great
feeling
in
my
case
for
some
reason
or
other.
and
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
held
that
my
plea
of
limitations
was
well
founded.
in
that
decision,
which
was
rendered
in
1948
--
remember,
i
had
already
have
been
sick
and
whatnot
since
1936,
even
since
1935
when
i
left
the
school.
that
decision
became
quite
important
as
i
appreciate
it
because
it's
all
mentioned
in
the
brief
because
there
was
the
question
of
prescription
or
the
statute
of
limitations
in
the
argument
that
we
made
that
the
prescription
was
well
founded
in
the
counter
argument
made
by
the
authorities
that
they
haven't
been
able
to
prosecute
me
because
of
my
illness.
and
then,
this
important
question
to
me
came
up
whether
because
of
the
way
in
which
the
time
had
divided
itself
between
what
i
call
free
time
when
i
might
have
been
prosecuted
and
close
time
when
i
was
under
a
decree
and
couldn't
be
prosecuted.
whether
that
fact
had
interrupted
the
prescription,
destroyed
where
it
had
gone
before,
so
that
it
will
have
to
start
all
over
again,
or
whether
it
had
merely
suspended
the
prescription
during
the
period
of
enforced
inaction
on
the
part
of
the
state.
and
the
supreme
court
in
the
unanimous
case
on
this
plea
of
prescription
held,
"the
question
was
new
and
had
never
heard
of
or
raised
by
anybody."
they
could
find
no
case
in
point
and
they
had
to
decide
it
as
they
said,
at
212
louisiana.
according
to
their
sense
of
justice,
and
they
decided
in
so
many
words
that
since
the
inability
to
prosecute
me
in
that
criminal
action
then
11
or
12
years
old,
had
not
been
due
to
any
act
on
my
part
to
nothing
willful,
to
know
misconduct.
but
since
on
the
contrary
and
these
are
the
words
of
the
court,
“if
the
act,
a
situation
was
neither
deliberate
nor
intentional,”
and
again,
using
the
words
of
the
court,
“that
resulted
from
a
condition
which
i
could
not
prevent,”
or
as
the
court
said
exactly
over
which
i
had
no
control,
that
they
would
hold
that
the
prescription
had
been
suspended
and
not
interrupted.
of
course,
that
was
the
end
of
that
particular
case.
now,
there
had
been
only
two
cases
against
me
that
i've
just
told
your
honors.
this
first
case
which
i
won
before
the
jury
and
this
other
case
which
they
had
been
holding
back
for
10
years
in
a
hope
of
being
able
to
use
it,
if
they
could.
i
have
never
been
convicted
of
any
felony
or
other
offense.
my
mental
condition
required
this
hospitalization
for
10
years,
running
into
from
roughly
a
little
over
10
years,
running
from
1936
to
1948.
in
1948,
i
was
quite
well.
i
knew
i
was
well.
i
think
everybody
else
in
the
city
of
new
orleans
knew
that
i
was
well,
although
i
had
been
always
institutionalized.
i
was
never
out
of
an
institution
from
1936
to
1947.
shortly
thereafter,
the
committee
proceeding
which
had
been
held
against
me
which
we
call
interdiction
in
louisiana
was
lifted
at
a
regular
contested
hearing
of
the
probate
court
which
--
with
our
civil
district
court
which
handles
those
matters.
and
in
1948,
no
charges
against
me
whatever,
being
perfectly
well
having
gone
through
10
years
of
care
and
treatment
and
having
been
completely
restored
to
health,
i
undertook
to
begin
again
the
practice
of
civil
law.
i
must
say
that
my
friends
and
my
clients
knew
that
i
had
what
i
may
call
a
tough
time.
well,
they're
pleased,
i
think.
old
clients
flocked
to
me
and
for
six
years
without
a
word
of
complaint
--
or
for
four
years
without
a
word
of
complaint
from
the
bar
association.
and
for
six
years
concurrently
with
no
objection
from
anyone,
any
lawyer,
any
opponent,
any
member
of
the
public,
i
undertook
again
the
practice
of
law
which
had
been
stopped
by
my
illness
in
1936.
i
was
very
successful,
very
active
as
i
had
always
been.
and
from
1948
to
1954,
during
those
six
years
that
i
was
permitted
to
resume
practice
and
that
i
actually
resumed
practice,
it
is
a
fact
and
i
--
that's
in
the
record,
that
i
tried
37
cases
in
the
appellate
courts
of
the
state,
real
cases,
contested
cases
and
--
but
they've
seen
themselves
on
an
act
which
during
my
illness,
i
had
committed
on
--
as
they
say,
i
have
no
recollection
of
it,
on
the
2nd
of
january
1935.
in
june
1952,
the
bar
association,
which
is
a
prosecuting
unit
for
disbarment
in
louisiana,
brought
a
disbarment
suit
against
me,
nothing
having
made
in
examination,
preliminary
examination.
i
went
on
practicing
law
because
as
i
tell
you,
the
period
of
my
activity
was
from
1936
to
1954.
it
only
stopped
when
there
was
a
final
decree
of
disbarment
against
me
in
the
state
court.
during
which
time
as
i
say,
i've
tried
37
hardly
contested
cases
which
are
all
in
the
books
and
which
i
have
tried
alone.
i
have
had
associates,
but
i'm
not
in
the
habit
of
shaking
work
or
turning
it
over
to
other
people.
i
like
to
do
things
myself.
i
never
had
direct
other
partners
at
any
time
in
my
career
which
as
i
say
started
in
1910.
this
proceeding
for
disbarment
as
i
say
based
on
an
act
which
was
said
to
have
been
committed
in
1935
was
tried
in
the
way
in
which
we
try
it.
under
our
--
under
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
louisiana,
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
i
must
say
--
ask
you
to
let
me
emphasize
that.
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
for
disbarment
is
vested
by
the
constitution,
not
by
any
statute
in
the
original
jurisdiction
of
our
supreme
court.
the
supreme
court
doesn't
actually
try
disbarment
cases.
it
takes
a
complaint
from
a
bar
committee,
we
have
an
integrated
bar.
and
of
course,
the
defendant
has
afforded
every
opportunity
to
defend
himself,
and
if
i
claim
that
there
has
been
a
warrant
of
due
process
in
my
case,
let
me
make
clear
at
once
that
i'm
not
complaining
of
any
lack
of
procedure
of
due
process.
i've
got
plenty
opportunity
to
defend
myself.
what
i
claim
is
a
lack
of
substantive
due
process
for
the
reasons
which
i
would
just
--
would
mention
in
just
a
moment.
i
--
the
--
in
accordance
with
the
rules
applying
in
that
case,
the
matter
was
referred
to
a
commissioner
and
the
testimony
was
taken
before
it.
all
i
could
testify
to
was
that
i
had
signed
the
documents
that
they
showed
me.
i
admitted
that
they
were
my
signature.
i
couldn't
remember
why
or
under
what
circumstances.
remember,
this
was
already
18
years
since
1935,
but
then
it
come
into
period
of
my
illness.
in
the
same
period
of
time
referred
to
by
the
supreme
court
and
holding
in
the
case
in
the
212,
that
they
must
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
whatever
i
had
done
was
not
deliberate
or
intentional
but
the
result
of
what
they
call
a
--
a
condition
over
which
i
had
no
control.
the
commissioner
or
the
bar
association
was
quite
vehement.
they've
always
been
very
aggressive
in
my
case
and
they
protested
that
this
was
a
criminal
act
and
they
continued
to
protest
and
have
always
protested.
they've
had
to
protest
because
they
lost
the
suit
as
i
appreciate
it
in
this
--
although
i
was
disbarred
by
the
state
court,
they
lost
the
suit.
the
report
of
the
commissioner
was
that
unquestionably,
i
was
suffering
from
some
kind
of
insanity
or
lack
of
mental
control.
and
then
under
our
practice,
exceptions
were
filed
to
the
report
of
the
commissioner
and
the
matter
was
argued
on
these
exceptions
before
the
supreme
court
of
the
state.
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
held
that
--
apparently,
that
my
insanity
had
been
proved.
they
put
it
in
this
way.
they
said,
“we
don't
think
insanity
is
a
defense,
but
we
will
concede
it.
we
will
concede
it
for
the
purpose
of
this
discussion
or
for
the
purpose
of
this
decision,”
as
i
say.
and
therefore,
we
--
we
will
disbar
theard.
and
then,
to
emphasize
if
it
was
possible
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
they
went
out
finding
me
guilty
of
any
criminal
act,
they
took
up
the
exception
which
had
been
filed
to
the
master's
report
by
the
bar
committee
and
they
said,
“the
bar
committee
who
separates
that
the
master
made
a
report
that
theard
was
guilty
of
a
criminal
act,
that
the
way
he
wrote
that
shows
that
in
1935.
he
was
guilty
of
a
criminal
act.”
and
we
accept
to
the
master's
report
and
the
supreme
court
said,
“under
the
view
that
we
have
taken
over
the
matter,
we
are
conceding
the
insanity.”
under
the
view
that
we
have
taken
here
the
matter,
we
don't
have
to
consider
this
charge
of
criminality
which
i
think
was
a
loss
of
the
case
by
the
committee
which
knew
that
there
was
something
fatally
wrong
with
the
decree
of
disbarment
based
on
an
insane
act
which
was
conceded
by
the
court
which
decreed
the
disbarment,
but
which
decreed
the
disbarment
just
the
same.
now,
because
it
was
conceded
by
it,
i
say
as
the
basis
for
the
disbarment
excluding
specifically
all
other
claims
made
in
that
case.
now,
that
was
particularly
distressing
i
think
and
perhaps
say
in
with
respect,
particularly
wrong
because
the
constitution
of
louisiana
which
as
i
have
just
told
you,
controls
disbarment
absolutely,
and
vest
it
with
the
supreme
court
also
provides
in
so
many
words.
and
that's
the
history
of
a
law
or
condition
which
arose
through
the
years
and
goes
back
60
years,
that
the
court
is
vested
with
jurisdiction
for
disbarment
in
cases
of
misconduct.
i
say
and
i
think
anyone
would
agree
that
under
that
constitutional
fiat,
there
can
be
no
--
no
disbarment
in
louisiana
and
there
should
be
no
disbarment
in
louisiana
and
there
can
be
no
disbarment
in
louisiana
except
for
the
cause
set
forth,
namely,
misconduct.
the
rules
of
the
court
and
the
rules
of
the
integrated
bar
association
which
has
been
made
the
rules
of
the
court
by
an
order
of
the
court,
go
further
and
say
that
the
lawyer
shall
be
disbarred
who
is
guilty,
of
course
i
couldn't
say
of
anything
in
contravention
of
the
constitution,
but
they
make
it
i
think
a
little
stronger
because
they
say
and
it's
all
quoted
in
the
brief.
that
disbarment
will
be
--
will
result
from
the
willful
misconduct
of
an
attorney.
now,
how
does
the
supreme
court
could
hold
that
i
should
be
disbarred
because
--
or
despite
the
fact
that
i
was
insane
and
not
from
any
other
cause
where
the
only
cause
under
the
constitution
should
have
been
misconduct,
more
than
i
can
say.
now,
your
honors
would
say
that
this
is
not
an
appeal
from
the
decree
of
the
state
court,
no,
but
immediately
after
the
supreme
court
had
rendered
this
judgment
in
1954.
i
prayed
for
a
rehearing
which
had
been
refused.
i
have
done
everything
else
that
i
could.
immediately,
the
bar
association
notified
the
united
states
attorney
that
i
should
be
--
the
proceeding
should
be
taken
against
me
to
disbar
me
in
the
federal
court
and
this
is
the
proceeding
that
we
are
discussing
now.
the
united
states
attorney
i
suppose
could
have
disbarred
me
for
any
--
any
kind
of
act
that
he
thought
was
--
which
involved
justification,
but
he
chose
to
bring
a
suit
for
my
disbarment
in
the
federal
court
based
exclusively
on
this
judgment,
exclusively
on
this
judgment
which
said
that
eliminating
all
other
causes,
i
should
be
disbarred
because
i
was
sick.
so,
i
raised
several
defenses.
this
is
a
proceeding
that
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
comes
here.
i
raised
the
proceeding
that
of
course
the
court
had
deprived
me
of
my
property,
had
deprived
me
of
my
property
without
due
process
of
law
just
as
to
why
it
raised
that
proceeding
in
the
state
court.
that
no
man,
no
matter
what
the
basis
may
be
for
disbarment
and
most
people
agree
that
disbarment
is
not
based
on
the
idea
of
punishment,
but
it's
based
on
the
protection
of
the
community.
that
no
man
should
be
sued
no
man
--
under
either
basis
because
he
was
sick
especially,
especially
when
the
disbarment
suit
was
brought
in
the
state
court
17
years
after
the
act,
and
in
the
federal
court,
19
years
after
the
act.
in
two
weeks,
the
act
will
be
21
years
old.
and
in
the
meantime,
he
had
regained
his
health,
nobody
questions
my
complete
sanity
and
my
health
mentally
and
physically
at
this
time.
nobody
conceded
and
nobody
questioned
it
then,
but
i
have
had
10
years
of
--
of
sorrowful
treatment,
quiet
and
the
kind
of
help
to
--
or
the
kind
of
care
and
treatment
to
which
i
think
i
was
entitled
and
which
brought
out
no
matter
what
the
case
may
bring.
a
very
satisfactory
help
so
far
as
my
personal
condition
was
concerned.
so,
i
urge
that
defense,
or
is
a
complete
violation
of
the
state's
statute
which
limits
disbarment
to
misconduct
as
i
have
just
told
you.
and
i
urge
the
long
period
that
had
ensued.
i
think
that
i've
told
your
honors
all
that
i
can
say
about
my
complete
recovery
and
about
the
cause
of
the
disbarment
which
was
illness.
i
raised
the
question.
it
was
in
the
state
court
and
in
the
federal
court
too
because
there,
i
think
that
the
application
of
that
doctrine
was
quite
quoted.
i
said
that
the
long
delay
had
changed
everything
in
my
life,
made
it
almost
impossible
for
me
to
defend
myself
in
19
years
since
the
act
was
committed
or
now
sued
in
the
federal
court,
and
that
i
had
absolutely
recovered,
that
i
had
practiced
for
six
years
without
any
complaint
from
anybody
except
this
belated
complaint
from
the
bar
association.
no
one
else,
no
judge
has
ever
questioned
my
right
to
appear
before
him.
i
appeared
before
the
supreme
court
during
that
period
any
number
of
times.
i
can't
tell
you
because
i
haven't
really
undertaken
to
find
out.
i
can't
tell
you
how
many
of
these
37
cases
were
cases
in
the
orleans
court
of
appeal
or
in
the
supreme
court.
i
dare
say
that
the
majority
was
in
the
orleans
court
of
appeal,
but
there
were
questions
of
great
importance
which
i
tried
before
the
supreme
court.
i
was
the
first
person
who
ever
succeeded
in
getting
a
louisiana
--
in
getting
a
judgment
in
louisiana
against
the
coca
cola
company
in
the
supreme
court
or
in
where
else
if
i
know
in
state.
i
won
a
lot
of
tax
cases
and
land
cases
which
i
tried
some
succession
matters
which
--
land
matters
which
have
been
a
specialty
of
mine
during
my
many
years
of
practice.
and
i
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
fact
that
we
had
in
louisiana
a
state
--
a
statute
which
provides
a
liberative
prescription
or
a
statute
of
liberative
limitation,
which
provides
that
in
any
personal
action
for
which
in
the
language
of
our
civil
code,
there
is
no
enumerated
prescription.
no
special
prescription
that
the
prescription
of
10
years
will
apply.
now,
there
was
a
--
and
this
was
brought
in
the
state
court
17
years
after
the
act
of
1935.
in
the
federal
court,
19
years
after
the
act,
i
think
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
--
and
i
told
the
federal
court
because
the
solicitor
general
has
said
this.
he
said
a
number
of
things.
he
says
for
example
that
the
federal
court
is
bound
by
the
description
of
the
--
or
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
by
the
state
court.
and
i
answer
that
it
must
be
a
--
an
interpretation
that
doesn't
do
violence
to
language.
you
can't
say
that
any
court
under
the
direction
to
disbar
only
for
misconduct
can
interpret
overturn
--
upset
the
statute
by
saying
that
that
means
that
the
--
the
subject
can
be
disbarred
for
illness.
nobody
can
say
that
--
that
illness
is
misconduct.
and
of
course,
in
a
question
in
which
a
man's
property
and
right
to
practice
has
been
taken
from
him
which
is
a
right
of
property,
i'm
not
going
to
argue
that
to
your
honors.
it's
been
many
times
decided
by
you
and
that
no
frail
or
incorrect
interpretation
of
the
statute
by
the
state
court
is
binding
on
this
court.
when
you
grant
certiorari,
the
case
is
yours
and
you
don't
shed
your
power
by
undertaking
to
look
into
the
case.
now,
may
i
say
before
i
sit
down
and
perhaps
i
can
have
a
few
more
minutes
for
rebuttal,
i
don't
know.
may
i
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
who
took
this
case,
the
district
judge
listened
to
a
short
argument,
decided
that
i
should
be
disbarred.
they
filed
no
brief.
it
didn't
seem
to
be
an
insensitive
file
of
brief
there,
but
we
took
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeal
and
we
argued
the
very
same
points
that
we
are
arguing
here.
and
the
court
of
appeal
landed
a
memorandum
--
mr.
delvaille
h.
theard
--
opinion
--
mr.
delvaille
h.
theard
i
must
keep
it
now.
mr.
delvaille
h.
theard
well,
i'm
going
to
save
it
right
now
--
mr.
delvaille
h.
theard
--
say
merely
this
that
the
court
of
appeal
--
i
didn't
want
to
fail
to
mention
what
the
court
of
appeals
said.
mr.
delvaille
h.
theard
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
i'd
offered
no
evidence
and
that
the
--
i
had
offered
no
evidence
and
that
my
arguments
were
not
persuasive,
that's
all.
well,
there
was
no
evidence
to
offer
because
i
was
being
sued
on
a
judgment
of
the
court
which
was
the
sole
cause
of
action.
and
my
arguments
were
not
persuasive,
i'm
sorry.
i've
done
the
best
i
could
here.
i'll
save
a
few
minutes
if
you'll
allow
them
to
me.
mr.
delvaille
h.
theard
i
appreciate
it.
mr.
delvaille
h.
theard
--
very,
very
much.
mr.
delvaille
h.
theard
i
want
to
say
this.
i
find
it
difficult
to
workout
a
plan
of
thought
as
it
must
have
existed
in
the
thought
of
the
district
judge
in
this
case
because
the
proceeding
in
the
district
court
presented
for
his
decision,
nothing
but
what
was
perfectly
apparent
on
the
judgment
of
the
state
court
which
was,
that
here
was
a
disbarment
suit
with
the
bar
association
not
claiming
insanity,
the
bar
association
claimed
criminality.
we're
told
that
the
--
the
forgery
and
the
--
the
embezzlement
was
proved.
all
that
was
proved
was
that
i
said
“yes"
after
i've
realized
that
it's
my
handwriting.
i
don't
remember
a
thing
about
it
and
nothing
else
was
proved.
mr.
delvaille
h.
theard
but
--
mr.
delvaille
h.
theard
well,
i
--
mr.
delvaille
h.
theard
well,
i
raised
them
because
they
appeared
to
me
to
be
on
the
face
of
the
decree
of
the
state
court
just
as
i'm
raising
them
now
because
they
were
on
the
face
of
the
decree
of
the
state
court.
there
was
nothing
that
i
could
add
to
what
the
state
court
had
said.
mr.
delvaille
h.
theard
oh,
i
don't
know
about
that,
sir.
i
couldn't
say
that.
i
--
i
don't
believe
that
as
my
friend
has
conceded,
the
manual
which
i
know
nothing
about
says
that
there
is
no
duty
on
a
federal
district
judge
to
bring
a
suit
for
disbarment
on
the
basis
of
a
state
court.
therefore
and
certainly,
they
are
two
separate
and
distinct
things.
i
don't
know
what
the
result
would
be
if
your
honors
held
that
this
holding
me
insane
and
therefore
subject
to
disbarment
was
now
--
i
don't
know
what
effect
that
would
have
on
the
states
court.
i'm
not
trying
that
now
and
i
--
i
haven't
reached
that
point,
really.
mr.
delvaille
h.
theard
i
think
i've
got,
mr.
justice,
i
think
i've
got
the
only
determination
that
could
be
given
to
me,
although
i
think
the
result
was
incorrect.
here
are
--
you
have
the
views
of
the
state
court.
we
don't
care
whether
this
man
was
guilty
or
not
guilty.
he
says
he
was
insane.
the
evidence
proves
that
he
was
insane.
there
was
no
evidence
offered
by
the
committee
on
the
question
of
insanity.
i
offered
my
witnesses,
my
two
doctors,
and
so
on,
but
they
offered
no
evidence.
they
apparently
thought
that
because
a
man
while
insane
had
signed
a
document.therefore,
he
was
a
criminal.
and
that
was
what
they
denied
--
relied
on.
and
therefore,
when
the
case
came
up
before
the
state
court,
what
i
think
they
held
and
what
i
believe
is
a
fair
statement
from
reading
their
opinion
is
this.
we
concede
for
this
discussion.and
now,
that's
a
finding,
a
concession
is
a
finding.
we
concede
for
this
discussion
the
insanity
of
this
defendant,
of
this
petitioner
now.
and
we
don't
care
mr.
bar
association
to
listen
to
your
exception
saying
that
he
was
not
insane
but
that
he
is
a
criminal
and
he
ought
to
be
disbarred
for
that
reason.
we
refuse
to
pass
on
that.
however,
it's
what
they've
said
in
view
of
the
conclusion
reached
and
hear
and
above
declared.
we
need
not
determine
the
committee's
exception.
now,
that
was
brought
to
the
federal
court
by
the
united
states
attorney
and
that's
all
that
was
brought
to
the
federal
court.
and
of
course,
if
the
state
judgment
--
and
i
was
ordered
under
their
practice
because
there
are
83
--
i
think
there
are
83
district
courts
in
the
united
states.
and
only
a
certain
number
have
one
form
of
action
and
the
others
have
another.
now,
in
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana,
the
fact
that
a
judgment
has
been
rendered
for
disbarment
in
the
state
court
is
by
no
means
binding
in
the
federal
court
for
the
eastern
district.
that's
why
they
ordered
me
to
come
into
court
to
present
what
i
had
to
say
and
what
i
believe
with
reference
to
that
judgment.
if
it
had
been
otherwise,
why
the
--
the
disbarment
in
the
federal
court
would
have
been
automatic
and
unfortunately,
i
could
not
be
here.
i
do
thank
you
gentlemen
for
your
kindness.
