h.
hickey
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
on
march

1954,
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
entered
an
order
of
disbarment
against
the
petitioner,
excluding
him
from
practice
in
the
state
courts
of
louisiana.
petition
for
certiorari
from
that
judgment
was
denied
by
this
court.
on
march
16,
1955,
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana
entered
an
order
of
disbarment
pursuant
to
rule
1
after
that
court.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
on
appeal
affirmed.
this
court
granted
certiorari
and
it
is
that
judgment
that
is
under
inquiry
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
yes,
sir.
in
the
district
court,
following
the
entry
of
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana,
united
states
attorney
filed
a
motion
pursuant
--
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
pursuant
--
pursuant
to
rule
1
(f)
of
the
federal
rule
of
the
court
rules
which
are
printed
on
the
government's
brief
at
page
2,
which
provides
that
whenever
it
is
made
to
appear
to
the
court
that
a
member
of
the
bar
of
that
court
has
been
suspended
or
disbarred,
or
convicted
of
a
felony
in
any
other
court,
he
shall
be
forthwith
suspended
from
practice
before
this
court,
the
district
court.
and
unless
upon
noticed
mail
to
him
at
his
last
known
place
of
residence,
he
shows
good
cause
to
the
contrary
within
10
days.
there
shall
be
entered
an
order
of
disbarment
or
of
suspension
for
such
time
as
the
court
show
fit.
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
that
was
--
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
as
a
matter
of
--
of
cause,
the
practice
is
banned.
i
can
quote
only
the
instruction
that
is
contained
in
the
united
states
attorney's
manual
that
when
it
has
come
to
the
attention
of
the
united
states
attorney
that
a
member
of
the
bar
has
been
disbarred
or
convicted
of
a
felony
or
has
acted
in
such
fashion
as
to
be
disciplined
by
the
court
of
the
state
in
which
the
federal
court
sits
and
of
which
he
is
a
member
of
the
bar,
united
states
attorney
shall
give
serious
consideration
to
bringing
appropriate
proceedings
before
the
district
court
of
the
district
in
which
he
is
an
officer.
and
it
is
in
that
--
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
he
--
he
shall
give
serious
consideration
to
what
has
occurred
and
to
bring
appropriate
proceedings
before
the
district
court.
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
no,
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
does
not.
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
the
united
states
attorney
here
did
file
this
motion
in
this
court
--
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
--
pursuant
to
that
rule.
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
the
committee
on
professional
ethics
and
grievances
of
the
louisiana
state
bar
association
as
i
understand
it
brought
it
to
the
attention
of
the
united
states
attorney.
and
pursuant
to
that
notice,
the
united
states
attorney
then
filed
a
motion
to
which
he
attached,
to
which
he
attached
a
copy
of
the
opinion
and
decree
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court
which
had
ordered
the
disbarment
for
admitted
misconduct
done
under
an
allegedly
abnormal
mental
condition.
it
brings
me
to
a
statement
i
think
of
the
question
that's
presented
here.
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
all
right,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
no,
your
honor,
following
the
issuance
--
following
the
filing
in
of
that
motion
and
pursuant
to
the
rule
of
that
court,
an
order
to
show
cause
was
issued
to
petitioner.
and
pursuant
to
the
rule,
he
was
given
the
appropriate
time
within
which
to
respond
as
to
why
an
order
of
disbarment
should
--
should
not
enter.
attached
to
that
order
to
show
cause
was
a
copy
of
the
motion
and
a
copy
of
the
opinion
and
decree
of
the
state
court
of
louisiana.
the
petitioner
responded
to
that
motion
by
attacking
the
legality
of
the
decision
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court,
in
effect,
grounding
his
attack
on
one
that
the
louisiana
supreme
court
had
not
interpreted
louisiana
law
and
constitution
properly.
and
therefore,
the
judgment
was
defective
in
ordering
disbarment
under
what
he
considered
was
admitted
misconduct
but
done
under
--
in
some
form
of
insanity.
secondly,
he
said
in
his
order
--
just
answer
to
the
order
to
show
cause
in
which
also
was
a
point
which
he
urged
before
the
louisiana
supreme
court
in
the
initial
proceeding.
that
under
the
doctrine
of
louisiana
of
latches
in
prescription,
the
disbarment
proceedings
should
have
been
barred
because
they
were
grounded
on
a
charge
that
had
occurred
at
that
time
some
16
years
before.
and
then
lastly,
he
attacked
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
louisiana
and
thereby
questioned
the
propriety
of
the
judgment
of
the
--
the
court
of
the
district
in
louisiana,
the
federal
district
court,
on
the
ground
that
to
enter
an
order
of
disbarment,
on
circumstances
which,
while
misconduct
had
been
admitted,
were
done
under
what
were
allegedly
an
abnormal
condition,
was
the
deprivation
of
his
property
right
in
the
practice
of
the
law
and
therefore,
in
this
particular
instance,
it
would
be
unconstitutional
for
the
district
court
to
adopt
the
standard
applied
by
the
court
in
louisiana.
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
yes,
justice
black,
mentally
abnormal
condition.
now,
if
i
may
just
recast
the
sequence
of
facts
in
what
--
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
yes.
then,
the
district
court,
following
a
hearing
after
that
order
was
returned
and
in
which
no
evidence
was
taken.
entered
an
--
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
argument
of
counsel.
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
on
the
motion
and
the
return.
and
i
believe
mr.
theard
submitted
a
--
a
brief,
statement
of
points
in
authorities
to
support
his
position.
the
district
court
entered
an
order
without
opinion,
making
the
rule
absolute
and
issuing
an
order
of
disbarment.
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
it
--
there
is
a
fair
statement
to
say
in
the
light
of
the
response
of
the
petitioner.
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
in
other
words,
the
arguments
which
were
made
in
the
district
court
were
found
as
unpersuasive
to
that
court
as
the
arguments
that
were
made
by
mr.
theard.
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
i
think
--
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
it
is,
your
honor,
upon
also
a
statement
of
--
of
character.
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
well,
yes.
in
other
words,
as
i
have
pointed
out
in
my
brief,
there
is
a
very
intimate
close
relationship
in
the
whole
federal
system
between
the
federal
bar
and
the
bars
of
the
state.
the
federal
courts
draw
the
members
of
their
bar
from
the
state
bars.
they
look
to
the
state
for
standards
of
admission.
they
look
to
the
states
as
in
this
particular
instance
for
the
original
standards
of
exclusion
and
discipline.
the
present
rule,
for
example,
of
the
district
court
of
louisiana
is
a
rule
that
we
were
able
to
find
in
our
research
with
the
files
of
the
department
in
26
district
courts.
there
are
some
22
district
courts,
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
for
example,
which
makes
automatic
disbarment
upon
a
showing
that
the
members
of
the
bar
had
been
disbarred
by
the
state.
there
are
10
courts
which
provide
for
disbarment
on
independent
inquiry
and
there
are
some
22
courts
which
indicate
that
they
have
no
rules
and
depend
on
their
inherent
thought.
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
so,
it's
--
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
precisely.
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
yes.
well,
under
its
rule,
it's
not
unlike
the
southern
district.
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
let
me
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
the
district
court
did
not
write
an
opinion,
so
what
i
am
going
to
answer
you
to
is
my
reading
of
the
--
of
the
record
as
was
presented
to
the
district
court.
and
based
on
that
reading
of
the
record
in
the
absence
of
opinion,
it's
my
view
under
the
rule
that
what
the
district
court
did
was
to
find
upon
a
return
of
the
order
to
show
cause,
that
it
did
not
change
its
view.
that
the
standard
applied
by
the
louisiana
supreme
court
to
members
of
his
bar
should
be
the
same
standard
that
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana
should
apply
because
there
had
been
no
showing
to
the
contrary.
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
and
in
that
sense,
it
adopted
the
rule.
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
their
purpose,
sir,
there
wouldn't
have
been
an
issuance
of
an
order
to
show
cause.there
wouldn't
have
been
a
hearing
on
that
order
to
show
cause
and
--
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
i
think
the
district
court,
as
this
court
had
pointed
out
in
--
in
(inaudible)
and
selling
and
radford
had
--
has
an
independent
standard
to
follow
in
its
bar.
it
does
not,
in
other
words,
follow
the
state
judgment
as
a
matter
of
comedy.
it
follows
the
state
judgment
as
a
matter
of
substantive
law.
and
on
this
case,
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
it
found
the
substantive
standard
applied
in
this
case
which
was
an
admitted
misconduct.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
state
of
the
petitioner's
mental
condition.
it
was
the
fact
that
he
had
embezzled
certain
funds
and
forged
and
added
certain
documents.
and
as
a
result
of
that,
the
innocent
clients
had
lost
funds
and
property.
and
the
fact
that
the
state
of
mind,
the
state
of
mind
or
the
motivating
force
behind
that
misconduct
may
have
been
one
which
could
have
excused
him
in
the
court
of
law.
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
and
in
turn,
the
district
court
felt
that
in
disbarment,
which
is
not
punishment.
in
disbarment
which
is
a
case
of
protecting
the
public
and
maintaining
the
integrity
of
the
profession
that
the
state
of
mind
was
irrelevant.
the
fact
was
that
the
conduct
occurred,
the
public
was
injured,
clients
have
suffered
and
therefore,
the
individual
involved
was
unfit
to
continue
to
practice
the
law
in
those
circumstances.
that
in
sum
is
the
--
the
motivating
course
of
decision
in
louisiana
and
in
the
district
of
--
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
i
think
that
is
a
--
correct
reading.
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
right.
if
i
may
--
if
i
may
underline
that
for
the
benefit
of
the
court,
i
think
it's
very
important
that
--
to
stress
to
the
court
that
on
this
bare
record,
there
has
been
no
finding
by
either
court,
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
or
in
turn,
by
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana
that
the
petitioner
was
sane
or
insane
at
the
time
he
committed
the
acts
which
grounded
the
petition
for
disbarment,
one.
two,
i
think
it
important
that
if
this
court
considered
it
relevant
as
to
whether
there
is
a
danger
of
recurrence
or
relapse
in
the
event
that
insanity
or
sanity
is
a
relevant
issue,
that
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
--
there
is
nothing
in
record
to
show
as
a
matter
of
evidentiary
fact
that
there
is
a
present
state
that
--
of
mind
or
of
condition
that
would
allow
anyone
to
say
that
there
is
no
danger
of
recurrence.
there's
no
danger
of
relapse.
there's
no
danger
that
any
dereliction
would
continue
in
the
future.
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
right.
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
right.
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
right,
right
your
honor.
in
fairness
to
the
petitioner
--
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
excuse
me?
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
your
honor,
that
is
a
correct
reading
and
what
happened
was
this.
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
well,
the
--
the
only
qualification
i
would
make
to
your
honor's
summary
is
that
the
supreme
court
did
not
adopt
that
finding.
the
supreme
court
preadmitted
that
finding.
the
supreme
court
found
in
its
view
of
the
case,
the
question
of
whether
the
petitioner
was
sane
or
insane
at
the
time
was
not
significant
to
the
decision
and
that
--
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
consequent
--
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
well
--
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
well,
on
the
contrary,
they
might
very
well
not
have
because
the
bar
association
and
i
am
a
bit
off
the
record
in
this
except
to
suggest
that
the
bar
association
objected
--
objected
to
the
finding
of
the
commissioner
that
the
petitioner
was
suffering
from
an
abnormally
mental
state
at
the
time
he
committed
the
alleged
misconduct.
and
on
appeal,
they
strenuously
urged
in
the
appellate
court
that
that
finding
was
not
supported
by
the
record.
indeed,
the
finding
should
be
to
the
contrary
based
on
the
--
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
--
evidence
that
was
presented.
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
but
the
--
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
well,
if
you
suppose
--
if
you
suppose
that.
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
that
is
not
the
fact,
mr.
justice
black,
if
i
may
--
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
they
refused
to
pass
on
the
finding.
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
that's
--
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
right.
if
--
if
i
may
quote
from
the
opinion.
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
precisely.
in
the
opinion,
the
--
the
court
--
the
supreme
court
said
that
this
misconduct
being
admitted,
it
matters
not
and
i
think
i'm
coming
as
close
to
the
language
as
i
can
on
my
memory.
it
matters
not
whether
the
act
was
caused
by
an
inability
to
discern
between
right
and
wrong,
or
by
a
specific
criminal
intent.
it
was
immaterial,
the
act
having
been
committed.
and
as
a
result,
mr.
justice
black,
the
finding
of
the
commissioner
that
he
was
insane
at
that
time
was
not
passed
on
because
they
considered
it
unnecessary
for
their
decision
and
that's
why
--
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
now,
let
--
on
that
point,
he
--
he
alleged
that
he
was
insane
at
the
time
and
if
i
may
say
so,
in
fairness
to
the
petitioner,
he
suggests.
he
suggests
that
in
this
criminal
case
of
212
louisiana,
the
supreme
court
and
incidentally
he's
the
same
justice
who
wrote
that
opinion
on
prescription
in
212
louisiana
that
wrote
the
--
the
final
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
on
disbarment.
but
in
212
louisiana,
petitioner
does
rely
--
does
rely
on
that
case
as
wholly,
that
the
supreme
court
has
found
that
he
was
of
unsound
mind
at
the
time
this
particular
act
was
committed.
i
might
say
in
passing
that
that
particular
criminal
case
involved
another
embezzlement,
not
this
particular
embezzlement
as
the
subject
of
the
present
disciplinary
action.
but
a
reading
of
that
case,
it
seems
to
me
as
i
point
out
in
the
brief,
clearly
indicates
that
the
court
was
there
considering
the
question
of
insanity
at
the
time
the
criminal
case
was
brought.
and
then,
adding
the
two
periods
of
time,
indeed
if
i
may
say
so
parenthetically,
they
assumed
lucidity
from
the
time
that
the
act
was
committed
in
order
to
attack
on
that
period,
namely,
1936
through
1937
when
the
lunacy
commission
found
that
petitioner
could
not
stand
criminal
trials.
in
attacking
that
period
on,
they
had
to
assume
that
he
was
able
to
--
to
stand
trial
at
that
point,
the
inference
would
be,
if
i
may
close?
the
inference
would
be
that
at
that
time,
the
court
was
not
ruling
on
this
state
but
only
on
the
time
when
the
trial
was
to
take
place.
so,
i
don't
believe
that
on
the
point
of
insanity,
at
any
time
was
there
a
judicial
inquiry
on
that
as
an
issue
because
both
the
district
court
and
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
considered
that
unnecessary
once
the
misconduct
was
admitted
--
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
in
substance,
that
is
the
case.
that's
the
record
that
is
--
is
here
and
it
is
our
view
that
in
adopting
that
substantive
standard,
there
was
no
violation
of
the
constitutional
right
of
the
petitioner.
one,
an
absent
valid
constitutional
objection,
it's
our
view
that
in
adopting
that
substantive
standard,
there
was
not
such
a
gross
abuse
of
discretion
that
this
court
would
consider
it
unreasonable
and
therefore
reversed
because
in
both
instances
when
we
consider
that
disbarment
is
not
being
treated
as
a
matter
of
punishment,
it's
not
being
treated
indeed
as
a
matter
of
reformation.
it's
not
being
treated
indeed
as
a
matter
of
setting
example.
it's
being
treated
as
a
means
by
which
the
court
and
the
bar
working
together
in
the
administration
of
justice
can
best
protect
the
public,
can
best
ensure
that
that
profession
of
the
law
would
permeate
it
with
the
highest
public
importance,
will
have
the
confidence
of
the
public
so
that
those
who
transgress,
those
who
do
forge
or
other
regardless
of
the
state
of
their
mind,
whether
it's
economic
necessity,
whether
it
is
an
inability
to
distinguish
between
right
and
wrong
as
long
to
use
the
language
of
the
court
--
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
or
some
form
of
insanity,
the
--
the
fact
is
that
as
a
result
of
that
particular
act,
the
pubic
has
been
defrauded,
clients
have
been
injured
and
the
standard
of
objectivity
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
had
noted
is
the
standard
that
louisiana
has
--
has
followed
in
this
case.
and
if
i
may
say
so,
the
only
case
as
we
have
been
able
to
find
have
been
the
(inaudible)
case
in
illinois
and
the
manhattan
case
which
is
more
dictum
than
the
fact
in
minnesota.
but
in
each
one
of
those
cases,
both
state
courts
in
arriving
at
the
same
problem
as
--
as
louisiana
in
treating
the
same
question
as
louisiana,
arrived
at
the
same
result.
and
in
--
in
one
phrase
in
--
in
the
--
illinois
court
had
said,
“in
effect
that
where
the
activities
of
a
man
who
has
claimed
to
be
insane,
result
in
the
defrauding
of
the
clients
so
that
the
symptoms
of
the
--
of
the
act
of
the
defrauding,
then
it's
the
defrauding
that
this
court
is
protecting
the
public
against,
and
it
is
on
for
that
reason
that
the
act
of
disbarment
occurs.
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
yes.
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
yes.
there
--
there
is
in
this
sense
--
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
--
your
honor.
there
are
two
supreme
court
opinions,
222
louisiana
and
225
louisiana
that
contained
statements
which
--
the
basis
upon
which
one
can
state
as
we
put
in
our
footnote
in
the
brief,
that
following
the
discovery
of
these
embezzlements
and
forgeries
in
1936,
the
petitioner
was
placed
in
an
insane
institution
for
some
years
and
was
put
under
a
judgment
of
civil
interdiction
from
august
1941
to
1948.
and
that
as
result,
the
louisiana
courts
found
and
the
law
is
unquestioned
that
the
bar
association
could
not
file
its
proceedings
of
discipline
during
that
whole
period
from
--
from
1936
to
1948.
mr.
edward
h.
hickey
now,
from
1948
to
1954,
i
think
that
probably
petitioner
has
telescoped
the
time
unnecessarily
by
leaving
out
two
or
three
steps
that
the
bar
association
had
taken.
in
1950
--
in
1950,
some
two
years
after
the
civil
interdiction,
judgment
was
--
was
lifted,
the
bar
association
grievance
committee
served
notice
on
petitioner
in
1950
that
it
was
undertaking
to
investigate
11
acts
of
misconduct
in
connection
with
his
practice.
from
1950
to
1952,
there
was
a
series
of
informal
conferences
and
so
on
in
connection
with
that
investigation.
in
1952
--
in
1952,
on
june
6th
and
june
7th,
by
stipulation,
the
first
specification
only
was
the
basis
upon
which
the
bar
association
proceeded
to
inquire
into
the
misconduct
of
the
petitioner.
and
in
1952,
at
that
hearing,
it
was
stipulated
that
the
question
would
turn
on
whether
--
on
--
in
1935,
he
had
forged
the
signatures
of
two
clients
to
a
note
for
$20,000
then
draft
it
to
make
it
look
like
a
mortgage.
in
following
that,
sold
it
and
misappropriated
the
proceeds.
as
to
that,
as
petitioner
indicated
in
his
opening,
he
admitted
that
but
claimed
that
he
was
of
unsound
mind.
following
that,
there
was
an
exception
to
the
petition
being
filed
in
the
supreme
court,
a
hearing
at
that
time
in
1953
following
that
a
remand
of
the
commissioner
back
to
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
again.
and
in
1954,
mr.
justice
harlan,
at
that
time,
the
supreme
court
entered
its
order
disbarring
the
petitioner.
so
that
there
was
no
undue
delay,
in
fact,
in
--
in
terms
of
--
of
the
basis
for
the
disbarment
as
well
as
the
proscriptions
of
the
supreme
court
in
its
opinion,
had
indicated
that
it
adhered
exclusively
to
its
reading
of
louisiana
law
which
in
the
absence
of
any
constitutional
objection,
or
conflict
with
the
federal
statute
i
believe
this
court
is
prepared
to
adopt.
and
for
the
reasons
i
have
outlined
in
the
earlier
aspect
of
my
argument,
i
feel
that
the
decision
and
judgment
of
the
district
court
in
adopting
the
same
standard
as
the
standard
of
the
state
in
which
it
sits,
not
only
did
not
violate
any
constitutional
right
of
the
petitioner,
but
it
was
a
reasonable
exercise
of
discretion
in
order
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
the
court,
protect
the
courts
as
instruments
of
justice
and
also
to
carry
out
the
responsibilities
of
maintaining
the
public
confidence
and
trust
in
our
profession.
so
that,
regardless
of
the
intent,
regardless
of
the
motivation
of
the
lawyer,
he
who
concedes
embezzling
funds
should
not
be
continued
in
a
place
of
trust
and
fiduciary
relationship
where
he
can
advise
clients.
and
for
that
reason
as
we
view
the
record,
the
decision
of
the
court
below
should
be
affirmed.
