it
had
approved
this
finding,

didn't
find
it
one

need
to.
justice

l.
black
suppose
--
justice

l.
black

suppose
they

committed
forgery
and
disregarded
and
refused
to
pass
it
all
on
the
finding
that
he
was
insane
when
he
did
it.
justice

on
the
district

he
allege
that
he
was
insane
at
the
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
--
or
whether
that's
from
insanity?
