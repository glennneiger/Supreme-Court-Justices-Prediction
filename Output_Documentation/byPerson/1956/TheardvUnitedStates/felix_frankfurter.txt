justice

and
their
government
stated
the
opposite,
to
what
these
proceedings
were
on
the
district
court.
justice
felix

(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
do
that,
would
you
--
you
don't
have
to
finish
mr.
hickey,
what
it
plays
in
the
district
court
after
the
district
u.s.
attorney
moved.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
this
follow
automatically,
then?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
what
happened?
justice
felix
frankfurter
an
argument
of
counsel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
motion
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
short
then,
is
it
fair
to
say,
mr.
hickey,
that
the
basis
of
the
order
of
disbarment
in
the
district
court
for
the
conclusion
it
moved
from
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
attacking
--
i'm
just
trying
to
undermine
their
judgment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
was
no
--
no
testimony
of
mr.
theard
that
he
didn't
stand.
he
was
cross-examined.
there
weren't
proof
of
--
or
excerpts
of
the
federal
government.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
i
ask
one
more
thing?
is
admission
to
the
district
court
automatic
upon
showing
or
representation
that
the
move
granted
to
the
member
of
the
louisiana
bar?
justice
felix
frankfurter
up
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
rule
of
--
justice

(voice

go
down
there
as
--
as
--
and
substantially
the
rule
of
his
bar
in
relation
to
the
members
of
his
bar.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this.
would
--
would
in
term
--
in
carrying
out
justice
brennan's
question.
in
your
view
on
the
record
that
was
before
the
district
court,
namely,
the
order
to
show
cause
and
the
return
plus
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
for
this
opinion.
will
the
district
court,
in
your
view
of
its
power
--
of
its
power,
had
been
free
to
say
including
--
mr.
hickey,
we
take
a
different
view
on
those
excepting
everything
that's
free,
court
of
louisiana
sets
forth
in
its
opinion.
we
take
a
different
view
and
reach
a
different
conclusion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
hickey,
have
i
read
the
opinion
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court
correctly
in
is
saying
and
i
adjust
my
--
my
eyes
rapidly
over
the
pages
of
all
the
opinions,
a
lot
of
quotations
--
judicial
padding?
i
arrive
in
to
say
that
there
is
no
information
that
their
order
of
disbarment
was
based
on
their
conclusion
of
the
petitioner's
present
incapacity
to
practice
the
law
or
the
hazard
of
the
community
with
having
to
allow
it
into
the
fact,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
merely
go
on
the
historic
premise
facts,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
--
or
any
allowable
basis
for
an
inference,
that
the
past
will
continue
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
the
past
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
they
worked
on
the
--
isn't
this
to
the
fact,
mr.
hickey,
that
the
supreme
court
said,
â€œhere
is
an
admitted
external
fact
that
somebody
signed
his
names
in
checks,
and
these
checks
constituted
misconduct
because
the
funds
weren't
there
whatever
is
before
us.
they
went
on
the
--
on
the
objective
fact
with
total
disregard
for
the
state
of
mind
in
which
the
signature
was
made.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
took
it
out
of
the
case.
they
decided
that
objectively,
an
offense
was
committed.
the
district
court
of
louisiana
for
the
eastern
district,
although
it
had
the
power
to
make
an
independent
investigation
or
make
an
independent
judgment
on
what
was
be
before
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana,
accepted
at
its
judgment,
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana,
that's
the
case.
