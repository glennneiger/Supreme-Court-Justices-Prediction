j.
brennan,

well,
do
those
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
proceedings
ordinarily
follow
the
course
after
either
a
disbarment
or
a
conviction
of
--
for
the
other
events
named?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
unless
the
united
states
attorney
here
who
initially
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
tell
us
on
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
who
brought
it
to
the
united
states
attorney's
attention?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
hickey,
i
--
i
think
you
suggested
that
the
factor
was
an
independent
redetermination
by
the
district
court
of
the
basis
of
the
louisiana
court
judgment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
i'm
--
i'm
trying
to
get
to
the
fact.
do
i
understand
that
your
view
is
that
in
--
actually,
there
was
a
redetermination
of
the
grounds
upon
which
the
louisiana
court
disbarred.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
--
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
except
that
that
might
almost
say
to
me,
i
think,
that
merely
because
the
louisiana
court
disbarred,
that
suffice
to
require
disbarment
by
the
district
court.
do
i
understand
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
theard,
are
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
--
is
it
your
position
that
actually,
the
district
court
disbarment
was
nakedly
upon
the
louisiana
court
judgment
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
without
any
inquiry
into
the
matters
which
you
raised
in
response
to
your
adversary?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
think
or
do
you
not
think
that
you
had
a
determination
in
the
district
court
upon
the
issues
that
you
raised
in
your
response
to
the
order
of
disbarment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
only
--
only
thing
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
whether
--
if
you're
telling
us
that
you
feel
that
in
the
district
courts,
you
did
not
get
an
independent
determination
of
the
--
the
facts
that
you've
raised.
