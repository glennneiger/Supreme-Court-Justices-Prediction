mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
when
the
court
arose
last
thursday,
i
had
reached
the
threshold
of
the
question
which
lies
at
the
heart
of
this
case,
namely,
whether
a
group
of
employers,
who
have
been
bargaining
with
a
union
on
a
multi-employer
basis,
may
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
lawfully
suspend
operations
when
the
union
in
support
of
its
demands
against
all
of
the
employers
calls
a
strike
against
one
of
them
for
the
purpose
of
bringing
about
a
perpetually
and
threatens
--
and
threatens
successive
strikes
against
all
the
other
employers
for
the
purpose
of
bringing
about
the
surrender
of
the
group
as
a
whole.
as
i
stated
last
thursday,
the
court
below
viewed
the
strike
by
the
union
against
one
of
the
employer
members
of
the
association
that
is
tantamount
to
a
withdrawal
by
the
union
from
that
relationship.
and
therefore
that
on
that
basis,
there
was
no
distinction
to
be
drawn
between
a
lockout
in
the
hands
of
an
individual
employer
and
a
lockout
in
the
hands
of
employers
who
are
members
of
an
association
such
as
here.
and
that
in
either
case,
their
lockout
or
suspension
of
operations
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
within
the
meaning
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
as
i
also
indicated
last
thursday,
we
think
that
neither
factually
nor
as
a
matter
of
law
can
the
strike
by
the
union
here
against
one
of
the
members
where
it
threatens
successive
strikes
against
all
the
other
members
of
the
association
and
where
the
union
has
made
no
effort
to
withdraw
from
the
multi-employer
bargaining
relationship
that
we
think
that
neither
factually
here
nor
as
a
matter
of
law
can
the
strike
be
regarded
as
equivalent
or
tantamount
to
a
withdrawal
by
the
union
from
the
preexisting
here,
then
it
is
existing
for
some
13
years
from
the
preexisting
bargaining
relationship.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
think
that
that
is
implicit
in
the
--
in
the
court
--
in
the
board's
opinion,
in
the
board's
decision.
that
the
board
said
that
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
that's
the
very
question.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
for
this
case,
i
do.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board
did
not
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board
treated
these
cases
one
where
the
union
had
not
withdrawn.
in
fact,
under
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
under
board
law
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor.
under
board
law,
the
union
cannot
withdraw
from
an
arrangement
of
this
kind.
now,
i
don't
think
we
need
to
go
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
cannot.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
the
court
below
went
into
that
with
some
light
and
i
think
we
don't
reach
that
issue
in
this
case,
but
i
will
--
i
would
--
i
can
explain
that.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
this
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there
is
no
stipulation
to
that
effect,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there
is
no
stipulation
or
agreement
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there
is
no
agreement
--
there
is
no
agreement
on
that
except
the
subsidiary
basic
facts
namely,
that
after
the
union
struck
one
of
the
employers,
it
continued
to
bargain
with
the
association
as
it
had
been
--
has
it
been
doing
so
for
the
past
13
years.
and
that
at
the
end
of
the
week,
following
the
calling
of
the
strike
and
the
suspension
of
the
operations
by
the
employers,
that
at
the
end
of
the
week,
the
union
and
the
association
reached
an
agreement
covering
all
of
the
employers
in
the
association.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
and
we
say
that
is
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
a
matter
of
law
that
the
union
cannot
be
held
or
withdrawn
from
the
preexisting
bargaining
relationship
in
those
circumstances.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
sir,
your
honor.
the
record
does
not
show
whether
this
unit
have
been
certified
by
the
board
but
i
have
made
an
independent
check
of
it
and
i
find
no
record
of
the
board
having
certified
this
one.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
--
the
record
does
not
show
that
either,
your
honor.
but
again,
i
made
a
check
of
this
in
the
board's
records
and
i
find
no
record
of
--
of
the
board
ever
--
ever
having
certified
issuing
as
a
bargaining
representative
of
any
of
the
--
either
of
the
--
of
all
the
employers
as
a
group
or
the
employers
individually.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
your
honor,
the
board
certifies
a
unit
--
a
union
as
the
bargaining
representative
of
the
employees
when
that
union
has
gained
a
majority
support
from
the
employers
within
the
particular
unit.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
a
union
which
believes
to
represent
some
majority
of
the
employers
of
a
particular
unit,
which
in
due
regard
is
appropriate
may
upon
a
proper
showing
petition
the
board
to
hold
--
conduct
an
election,
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
employees
want
that
union
as
a
part
of
a
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
no,
no.
if
the
union
--
if
the
union
has
in
fact
a
majority
support
among
the
employees,
the
employer
may
--
may
recognize
that
union
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
representatives
of
his
employees
without
a
board
election.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
certification
gives
the
union
formal
status
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative
whether
there
has
been
an
election.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
your
honor,
the
stipulated
facts
indicate
that
the
practice
has
been
this
and
i
assume
that
it
was
followed
in
the
final
--
when
the
union
and
the
association
upon
reached
the
agreement,
although,
we
have
no
specific
statement
as
to
what
exact
procedure
was.
but
the
practice
has
been
for
the
union
and
the
association
to
negotiate
an
agreement,
then
that
agreement
in
turn
is
submitted
to
the
various
employers.
and
if
the
employers
--
if
a
majority
of
the
employers
in
the
association
approved
with
the
agreement
then
all
of
them
signed
the
agreement.
now,
i
don't
know,
at
least
i
haven't
been
able
to
--
i
don't
recall
that
the
record
shows
whether
or
not
they
sign
--
each
employer
signs
separate
individual
agreements
or
whether
they
all
annexed
their
names
to
one
document.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
your
honor,
because
i
think
here
the
basic
relationship
is
a
group
relationship
and
the
--
you
--
you
have
a
situation
where
the
--
where
the
union
is
bargaining
to
obtain
an
agreement
from
all
of
the
employers
and
when
there
were
a
majority
of
the
employers
in
a
particular
--
in
the
--
in
the
association.
we
do
accept
that
then
it's
binding
upon
all
of
them.
they
all
signed.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
under
board
law,
yes,
your
honor.
and
if
i
may
explain
that
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
i
do
not
think
that
we
reached
this
issue
in
this
case
because
as
i
have
said
we
start
with
the
premise,
which
i
think
is
born
out
by
the
record.
there
has
not
been
withdrawal
here
by
the
union
from
this
multi-employer
relationship
but
i
will
explain
it.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
under
the
statute,
the
board
--
the
board
may
find
that
an
employer
or
plant
or
subdivision
of
a
plant
is
an
appropriate
unit
for
purposes
of
collective
bargaining.
now,
the
board,
by
combining
the
term
employer
in
section
9
of
the
statute
which
deals
with
the
certification
of
the
bargaining
units,
combining
that
with
the
definition
of
employer
in
section
2
--
in
section
2
of
the
statute
and
section
2
of
the
statute,
the
old
wagner
act
said
that
employer
included
those
who
acted
in
the
interest
of
the
employer
directly
or
indirectly.
the
taft-hartley
statute
defines
the
term
employer
as
including
those
who
are
acting
as
agents
for
the
employer
directly
or
indirectly.
now,
taking
section
9,
which
deals
with
the
certification
of
units
of
--
of
bargaining
units,
taking
the
term
employer
there
plus
the
definition
of
employer
in
section
2,
the
board
has
concluded
that
a
--
an
employer
association
that
is
a
unit
covering
a
number
of
employers
is
an
appropriate
unit
for
bargaining
representatives
but
it
is
crucial
that
--
that
the
employers
had
given
consent
to
that
kind
of
an
arrangement
since
the
association
under
the
statute
in
order
to
come
within
the
definition
of
the
term
employer
must
be
the
agent
of
the
employers
either
directly
or
indirectly.
so
now,
the
employers
must
enter
in
this
arrangement
voluntarily
because
their
consent
is
essential
under
--
under
the
statute.
once
they
withdraw
their
consent,
then
the
basis
--
the
basis
of
that
kind
of
unit
is
gone,
and
therefore,
the
employers
as
i
say
have
to
enter
in
this
arrangement
voluntarily
and
they
may
withdraw
at
any
time
because
their
consent
is
essential
under
the
statute
to
this
kind
of
arrangement.
on
the
other
hand,
the
union's
consent
to
this
arrangement,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
that
the
board
will
not
certify
a
multi-employer
unit
unless
there
has
been
a
history
of
this
--
of
this
type
of
bargaining
between
the
employer
association
and
the
union.
and
whether
there
has
been
such
a
history,
then
the
board
will
not
--
once
it
has
certified
such
a
unit,
it
will
not
permit
the
union
--
the
union
to
withdraw.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
unit
remains
--
remains
appropriate
even
though
the
union
wants
to
withdraw
from
that
--
from
that
arrangement.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
during
the
life
of
the
arrangement,
that's
right,
or
during
the
life
of
a
contract
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
which
has
been
executed
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
which
has
been
executed.
there
are
also
cases
where
--
where
the
union
has
sought
to
--
after
at
an
appropriate
time,
has
sought
to
get
the
board
to
certify
a
different
unit,
an
employer
unit,
an
individual
employer
unit.
the
board
will
not
permit
--
will
not
certify
the
individual
employer
unit
because
the
union
want
to
withdraw
from
the
multi-employer
arrangements.
that's
--
that
as
i
say
is
board
law.
we've
never
had
that
proposition
tested
in
the
courts.
but
again
i
say,
i
don't
think
we
reach
the
--
the
validity
of
the
board's
ruling
with
the
respect
to
withdrawal
or
non-withdrawal
of
the
unions
from
these
multi-employer
arrangements.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
well,
i
think
the
issue
here
is
whether
the
employers
who
are
bargaining
with
the
union,
representing
all
of
their
employees
are
bonding
with
them
on
a
multi-employer
basis.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
the
contract
did
come
to
an
end
here
virtually.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
their
contract
was
expiring
here.
the
contract
in
this
case
was
expiring,
your
honor.
they
were
negotiating
the
employers
to
their
association.
we're
negotiating
with
the
union
for
the
purpose
of
getting
a
contract
to
succeed,
the
existing
contract,
which
was
about
to
expire.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
now,
if
i
may
continually
with
the
--
what
i
think
is
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
employers
who
are
member
of
that
association
and
who
are
bargaining
with
the
union
on
a
multi-employer
basis.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
as
a
matter
of
history
and
actually
in
this
case,
may
lawfully
suspend
operations
when
the
union
in
order
to
obtain
acceptance
of
its
demands
by
the
entire
group
of
employers
may
lawfully
suspend
operations
where
the
union
caused
a
strike
against
one
of
them
and
threats
--
threatens
successive
strikes
against
all
of
the
other
employers
in
order
to
obtain
group
surrender
to
its
demands.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
sir,
your
honor.
there
is
no
antiunion
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
sir.
your
honor
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
court
--
i
think
not.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
court
--
the
board
here
expressly
found
that
the
employer's
action
was
not
motivated
by
the
usual
anti
or
union
busting
considerations
but
rather
the
employers
here
were
motivated
by
desire
to
protect
their
bargaining
relationship,
which
under
the
board's
--
in
the
board's
view
they
were
entitled
to
protect
their
solidarity
as
against
this
divisive,
whipsawing
strikes
which
were
calculated
to
bring
about
a
surrender
of
the
group
as
a
whole.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
motive
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
i
say
that
the
board
did
find
that.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board
found
no
antiunion
motivation
in
the
--
in
the
action
of
the
employers.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
if
there
were
antiunion
motivation,
if
i
may
put
it
perhaps
in
my
own
words,
if
there
were
antiunion
motivation,
then
this
kind
of
a
lockout
would
be
clearly
a
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
if
we're
union
busting
technique,
let
us
say,
or
in
purpose
to
--
to
defeat
the
employer's
exercise
of
their
rights
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
that's
--
if
i
may
add
and
to
keep
the
contest
between
them,
not
only
the
agreements,
but
the
contest
between
them
at
the
group
level.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
your
honor,
we
don't
say
that
the
whipsawing
strike
technique
against
the
employers
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
our
position
is
that
the
employers
may
--
the
employers
bargaining
upon
the
basis
that
they
do
on
this
case
may
lawfully
defend
upon
that
kind
of
a
strike.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
if
the
union
struck
all
of
them,
of
course
your
honor,
there
would
be
no
occasion
for
a
lockout
because
a
strike
had
taken
place
and
that
would
--
that
would
normally
cause
a
cessation
or
suspension
of
operation.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
now,
let
me,
i
believe
there
were
no
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
at
any
time
unless
there
is
an
existing
contract
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
between
the
parties.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
once
the
contract
terminates
--
once
the
contract
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
terminates
under
board
law
and
the
board
feels
that
this
is
--
that
this
result
is
--
is
dictated
by
the
statute,
the
employer
may
withdraw,
that
is
of
course.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
sir.
no,
sir
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there
was
none
by
the
board.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
there's
no
formal
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
does
not,
your
honor.
that's
the
point
that
i'm
--
i'm
suggesting
in
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
questions
that
--
well,
that's
a
very
interesting
facet
of
board
law.
i
don't
believe
whether
we
reached
the
question
here
or
there's
an
essential
appeal
with
the
question
or
whether
or
not
the
employers
may
withdraw
from
this
kind
of
a
relationship
or
whether
the
union
may
withdraw
from
--
from
this
relationship.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
usually
the
posture
in
which
the
matter
has
come
up
before
the
board.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i'm
trying
to
recall,
your
honor,
whether
there
had
been
a
situation
where
there
has
been
multi-employer
bargaining
but
without
a
board
certification.
and
then
there
has
been
--
there
has
been
a
petition
filed
by
union
to
break
away
from
that
and
my
recollection
serves
me
right.
i
believe
that
the
board
has
had
that
situation
and
it
will
not
permit
the
union
to
withdraw
from
that
arrangement
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
isn't
a
preexisting
history.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
not
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
not
unless
it's
otherwise
appropriate.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
must
be
otherwise
appropriate.
the
mere
agreement
of
the
parties
will
not
determine
the
appropriateness
of
the
unit.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
would
--
i
think
that
it
might
be
that
you
might
have
a
situation
where
the
parties
had
been
bargaining
on
the
basis
of
a
certain
unit,
which
the
board
subsequently
finds
to
--
to
have
been
appropriate.
but
the
union
may
--
may
file
a
petition
seeking
to
withdraw
from
a
unit
which
the
parties
themselves
have
regarded
as
appropriate
and
which
the
board
subsequently
finds
to
be
appropriate.
in
that
situation,
the
board
will
not
permit
the
union
to
withdraw.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
--
but
my
recollection
is
that
the
board
has
done
that,
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
isn't
necessary.
the
parties
may
deal
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
parties
may
deal
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
the
parties
may
deal
--
the
parties
may
deal
with
voluntarily
on
the
basis
of
any
that
they
deemed
appropriate.
but
once
they
seek
to
obtain
board
certification,
of
course,
on
this
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
the
unit
must
be
appropriate
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
on
the
board
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
your
honor,
the
board
will
find
a
multi-employer
unit
as
appropriate
only
where
--
only
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
--
i
think
it
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
you
have
--
where
you
have
that
informal
arrangement,
the
board
will
not
recognize
it
as
--
as
an
appropriate
multi-employer
bargaining
relationship.
here,
you
do
have
this
formal
arrangement
and
that's
why
we
think
that
there
are
special
considerations
applying
to
this
type
of
case
which
entitled
the
employer
to
protect
their
unity
or
their
solidarity
or
the
integrity
of
their
bargaining
--
or
their
form
of
bargaining
relationship.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there
was
a
formal
arrangement
in
this
sense,
your
honor,
that
under
the
stipulated
facts
here,
the
employers
had
authorized
--
had
authorized
the
association
for
some
13
years
to
bargain
upon
their
--
on
their
behalf
with
issuing.
and
then,
the
other
association
acting
on
--
in
behalf
of
the
employers
would
negotiate
an
agreement
with
the
union.
and
once
they
had
arrived
in
agreement
thereafter,
that
particular
agreement
would
be
submitted
to
the
various
employer
or
members
of
the
association.
and
if
a
majority
of
them
approved
the
agreement,
then
it
was
binding
upon
all
of
them.
they
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
a
very
important
question,
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
here
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
is
what
we
think
is
the
very
significant
premise
of
this
cases
that
here
the
employers
are
acting
through
an
association.
they
are
dealing
with
the
union
at
a
group
level
and
we
think
that
this
relationship
--
this
multi-employer
bargaining
relationship
necessarily
by
its
very
nature,
necessarily
presupposes
that
on
--
not
only
agreements
between
the
parties
be
at
the
group
level
but
also
that
economic
contest
between
the
two
groups
be
at
that
level.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
now,
if
i
may
explain
now
what
mr.
chief
--
justice
frankfurter
has
put
into
--
into
a
few
words.
because
i
see
the
first
consideration
which
we
seek
to
place
before
this
court
is
that
this
multi-employer
relationship
presupposes
that
not
only
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
be
at
the
group
level
but
also
that
the
contest
be
at
the
group
level.
as
we
have
indicated
in
our
brief,
this
type
of
bargaining
is
--
had
been
an
accepted
pattern
in
our
industrial
life,
it's
been
accepted
by
many
industries
and
as
the
authorities
which
we
have
collected
in
our
brief
indicate
this
type
of
bargaining
offers,
important
advantages,
not
only
to
employers
but
to
unions
as
well.
from
the
union's
standpoint,
this
type
of
bargaining
permits
them
to
achieve,
as
the
authorities
say,
permits
them
to
achieve
a
standardization
of
employment
conditions
which
is
an
important
labor
objective.
and
it
also
gives
the
union
a
--
a
greater
degree
of
protection
against
being
dislodged
by
a
rival
union,
then
would
be
the
case
if
the
contest
between
the
union
and
the
rival
union
were
on
a
single
employer
basis.
now,
on
the
other
hand,
this
relationship
also
offers
important
advantages
to
the
employers.
perhaps,
the
most
significant
factor
that
predisposes
employers
to
enter
into
this
multi-bargaining
relationships
is
that
it
is
thought
that
this
form
of
bargaining
offers
the
most
practical
way
from
making
the
collective-bargaining
process
work
in
a
real
and
meaningful
sense
as
far
as
the
employers
are
concerned.
this
type
of
bargaining
is
found
for
the
most
part,
most
prevalent
among
employers,
small
and
competing
employers
were
found
in
metropolitan
areas.
it's
been
estimated
and
some
70%
of
these
multi-bargaining
units
are
to
be
found
among
such
employers.
and
normally,
these
employers
acting
individually
possess
no
substantial
measure
of
bargaining
strength
as
against
the
union
which
represents
all
of
the
--
all
of
the
employees.
and
unless
these
employers
are
able
to
band
together
and
present
a
united
front
to
the
union,
they
have
little
or
no
room
for
any
effective
collective
bargaining
as
against
the
union.
and
from
a
very
practical
standpoint,
their
basic
choice
is
either
to
enter
into
these
multi-employer
bargaining
relationships
where
they
can
present
a
united
front
to
the
union
or
simply
they
have
no
bargaining
at
all
in
any
real
or
meaningful
sense.
as
one
student
of
this
subject
who
has
had
a
very
close
and
firsthand
experience
in
these
matters
has
said
--
had
said
that
in
the
absence
of
multi-employer
bargaining,
such
as
we
have
here,
the
unorganized
employer
has
no
bargaining
strength
or
whatever
when
he
acts
alone.
the
union
submits
its
demands.
if
the
lone
employer
does
not
exceed,
he
is
closed
by
a
strike,
the
union
diverts
his
employers
to
other
jobs.if
this
cannot
be
accomplished,
a
small
strike
assessment
on
those
continued
work
and
finance
strikers
indefinitely.
the
employer's
competitors
get
his
business,
striking
employers
are
at
work
elsewhere,
the
employer
is
soon
the
forgotten
man.
he
has
two
choices
to
submit
to
the
demands
or
to
go
out
of
business.
now,
by
entering
into
these
multi-employer
arrangements,
the
employers
seek
to
redress
this
very
obvious
imbalance.
they
seek
to
pull
their
strength
and
one
of
their
principal
objectives
is
to
meet
concerted
action
of
the
employees
with
concerted
action
by
the
employers.
and
by
creating
as
--
in
alignment
of
strength
on
both
sides,
they
hope
to
gain
a
more
effective
voice
in
--
in
the
determination
of
their
labor
contracts
and
it
would
be
the
case
if
they
were
acting
on
an
individual
basis.
they
also
hope
to
obtain
a
greater
degree
of
stability
and
industrial
peace.
but
beyond
these
considerations,
perhaps
the
most
important
consideration
which
makes
for
this
type
of
bargaining
insofar
as
the
employer
is
concerned
is
a
desire
and
a
purpose
to
be
free
from
being
singled
out
by
strikes,
by
the
unions
while
their
competitors
continue
to
remain
in
operation.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
your
honor,
i
believe
our
--
i
will
take
issue
with
your
basic
premise
that
the
--
a
single
non-struck
employer
may
engage
in
a
lockout.
now,
the
board
has
held
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
the
board
has
held
that
a
single
employer
who
locks
out
in
employees
in
anticipation
of
a
strike
merely
to
avoid
economic
hardship,
ordinary
economy
hardship
that
a
strike
may
entail
that
that
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
the
board
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board,
however,
has
expressly
reserved
a
decision
on
the
question
whether
a
single
employer
who
engages
in
what
we
call
a
bargaining
lockout,
in
other
words,
a
lockout
to
checkmate
the
union's
right
--
the
union's
strike
authority,
the
board
has
reserved
decision
on
that
question
and
it
is
on
that
question
which
i
respectfully
decline
to
indicate
my
own
personal
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
because
we
think
there
are
two
considerations
in
the
case
of
a
multi-employer
unit
which
--
on
which
we
base
our
case.
one
is
that,
as
i
have
said
before,
that
the
multi-employer
bargaining
relationship
necessarily
by
its
very
nature
presupposes
that
the
contest
between
the
union
and
the
employers
as
well
as
their
agreements
be
at
the
group
level.
now,
we
--
we
think
that
that's
implicit
in
the
arrangement
with
--
in
that
--
that.well,
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
these
reasons
necessarily
mean
that
the
bargaining
lockout
by
an
individual
employer
is
either
lawful
or
unlawful.
i
do
mean
to
suggest
that
this
case
has
different
considerations
which
make
it
unnecessary
for
this
court
to
reach
the
question
of
the
legality
of
the
lockout
in
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
hands
of
an
individual
employer.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
of
course,
the
board
originally
has
--
did
hold
in
the
morand
case
which
is
in
1952,
in
that
case,
it
held
that
the
--
the
lockout
in
the
hands
of
a
multi-employer
group
was
unlawful,
and
of
course,
a
fortiori
and
also
that
a
fortiori
on
that
basis
that
a
lockout
in
the
hands
of
a
single
employer
would
also
be
unlawful.
now,
the
basis
of
the
board's
decision
there
was
and
i
suppose
that
this
would
be
the
argument
as
against
the
single
employer
using
a
lockout,
the
basis
is
that
that
the
lockout
penalizes
the
employees
for
threatening
to
strike
and
that
it
deters
them
from
exercising
--
from
exercising
their
right
to
strike
under
the
statute.
now,
it
may
be,
however,
that
there
may
be
other
considerations
in
the
case
of
the
single
employer
which
may
justify,
may
make
it
legal
for
the
single
employer
to
lockout
his
employees
as
a
bargaining
technique.
but
as
i
say
the
board
has
reserved
that
question
and
it
hasn't
passed
upon
it
yet.
and
i
do
not
know
where
the
board
will
come
out
when
their
question
is
presented
to
it.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
second
--
the
second
differentiation
is
we
think
that
the
statute
has
recognized
this
multi-employer
bargaining
relationship
and
that
with
this
--
that
this
recognition
carries
a
further
recognition
of
the
employer's
legitimate
interest
in
protecting
their
solidarity
as
against
these
selective
divisive
whipsawing
strikes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
fact
that
the
board
has
been
authorized
to
certify
these
multi-employer
units.
we
think
that
that
authority
in
effect
recognizes
the
appropriateness
of
these
units
and
their
underlying
structure.
and
we
say
that
from
we
may
--
we
may
--
from
that,
it
is
perfectly
proper
to
say
that
congress
has
meant
to
preserve
the
employer's
legitimate
interest
in
protecting
their
solidarity
which
after
all
is
the
principal
reason
why
the
employers
entered
into
this
kind
of
an
arrangement
to
begin
with.
now
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
then
--
i
think
on
that
where
the
union
--
i
think
that
on
that
basis
we
come
--
we
come
to
discuss
--
actually,
what
we're
getting
at
is
to
whether
or
not
the
lockout
in
the
hands
of
the
single
employer
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
they
agreed.
they
agreed
with
the
board.
they
agreed
with
the
board
that
the
strike
against
the
one
employer
carried
with
it
the
threat
of
successive
threats
against
the
others
(voice
overlap).
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
because
the
lockout
in
the
one
case
is
directed
against
the
whole
group
and
whether
it's
directed
against
the
whole
group,
there
is
no
purpose
of
trying
to
preserve
--
preserve
the
integrity
of
the
relationship,
whereas
here
--
whereas
here,
the
purpose
of
the
strike
is
to
--
is
to
compel
one
employer
after
another
to
submit
to
the
union's
demands.
and
necessarily
--
necessarily
as
the
board
says,
atomizes
--
atomizes
the
--
the
solidarity
of
the
employer
or
the
employer
group.
it
tends
to
destroy
the
integrity
of
their
bargaining
relationship
as
against
the
union.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i'm
not
saying
it's
an
unfair
labor
practice,
your
honor.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
employer's
interest
in
preserving
this
integrity
is
one
which
is
entitled
to
recognition
as
against
the
employer's
right
to
strike.
and
that
in
balancing
the
--
in
balancing
this
--
this
subject
matter
here
as
the
board
may
properly
say
that
the
employer's
interest
in
preserving
their
integrity
is
such
that
it
may
call
for
some
limitation
upon
the
union's
right
to
strike.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
might
say
that
the
limitation
which
is
put
upon
the
union's
right
to
strike
is
merely
the
one
which
we
think
that
this
bargaining
relationship
necessarily
presupposes.
in
other
words,
that
this
strike
--
the
union
is
still
--
the
union
is
still
free
to
strike
but
at
the
level
at
which
the
bargaining
relationship
necessarily
presupposes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
they're
(voice
overlap),
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
i
think
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
correct.
that's
the
purpose
of
it.
and
we
think
that
the
employers
may
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
quite
right.
and
that's
why
we
said
that
you
can
distinguish
this
case
from
the
single
employer
that
the
court
does
not
need
to
reach
the
legality
or
illegality
of
the
lockout
in
the
hands
of
the
single
employer.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
of
course,
i
cannot
point
any
such
thing,
your
honor,
in
the
statute
itself.
but
i
do
say
this
that
the
statute
has
empowered
the
board
to
certify
these
multi-employer
bargaining
units.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
we
further
say
that
that
authority,
that
congress
in
permitting
the
board
to
do
that
has
recognized
as
legitimate,
something
to
be
taken
into
account
by
the
board.
the
employer's
interest
in
preserving
the
integrity
of
that
unit
which
the
board
may
certify
under
the
statute.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
now,
that
being
true,
if
they
lockout
or
shutdown,
it's
a
shutdown,
they
just
--
they
want
to
--
they
want
to
retain
the
right
to
shutdown
their
plant
like
the
employers
retained
the
right
to
strike.
they
insist
they
have
a
right
to
obtain
the
right
power
to
shutdown
their
plant
in
order
to
increase
their
bargaining
advantage.
that's
what
it
is,
isn't
it?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it's
not
--
of
course,
it
necessarily
increases
their
bargaining
advantage
but
i
would
put
it
in
these
terms
that
their
purpose
is
to
preserve
--
is
to
preserve
the
bargaining
relationship,
their
--
the
integrity
of
their
bargaining
relationship
as
against
the
union.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
i
have
to
repeat
i
think
pretty
largely.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
what
i
am
saying
that
i
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
cannot
point
--
i
cannot
point
any
statutory
phrase
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there
are
certain
provisions
in
the
statute
and
the
board
has
not
relied
upon
these
provisions
now
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there
are
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
only
as
you
may
interprets
that
the
sections
like
section
8
(d).
section
8
(d)
for
example,
prohibits
the
employers
from
engaging
in
lockouts
during
the
cooling
off
period
prescribed
by
that
statute.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
so
that
the
boat
won't
be
rocked
in
my
opinion.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
the
argument
has
been
made,
your
honor,
that
by
--
that
the
inference
to
be
drawn
from
that
is
that
the
lockout
is
permissible
in
other
situations.
now,
the
board
--
the
board
has
not
--
has
not
dealt
with
any
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
originally,
it
took
position
on
the
morand
case.
when
the
argument
was
urged
to
the
board
that
the
lockout
of
this
character
was
lawful
and
those
who
sought
to
support
the
legality
of
the
lockout
--
i've
been
going
with
my
time
--
those
who
sought
to
support
the
legality
of
the
lockout
in
the
hands
of
the
employers
where
they're
single
or
multiple,
pointed
to
section
8
(d)
and
also
other
sections
of
the
statute
which
link
of
the
labor
management
relations
act,
which
link
lockout
with
strike
and
forbid
it
under
certain
circumstances,
they
made
the
argument
that
the
inference
to
be
drawn
from
that
was
that
congress
would
not
have
prohibited
the
--
the
lockout
in
this
particular
situation
unless
it
was
otherwise
lawful.
the
board
rejected
that
argument
in
that
case
and
said
that
all
we
can
tell
from
section
--
section
8
(d)
is
that
in
the
particular
period,
the
cooling
off
period,
congress
meant
to
prohibit
lockouts,
whether
congress
meant
to
prohibit
lockouts
or
what
it
thought
of
lockouts
as
to
their
legality
or
illegality
in
any
other
situation,
we
do
not
--
we
cannot
infer
that
from
section
8
(d).
now,
in
this
case,
the
board
has
placed
no
reliance
or
whatsoever
upon
section
8
(d)
where
significance
or
inference
may
be
drawn
from
the
prohibition
of
the
lockout
in
that
particular
situation.
the
board's
case
here
rest
upon
the
--
the
nature
of
the
multi-employer
bargaining
relationship
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
pardon?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
the
board's
case
and
its
subsidiary
argument,
yes.
our
argument
here
rest,
rest
upon
two
propositions
that
this
case
has
--
that
at
the
multi-employer
bargaining
relationship
has
significant
difference.
there
are
significant
differences
between
the
multi-employer
bargaining
relationship
and
the
single
employer,
so
the
court
does
not
have
to
reach
a
single
employer
situations
and
that
these
significant
differences
are
one,
that
the
multi-employer
bargaining
relationship
which
the
statute
authorizes
as
appropriate
by
its
very
nature,
necessarily
presupposes
the
very
premise
of
it
is
that
both
contest
and
agreements
be
at
the
unit-wide
level.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
because
there
is
a
legitimate
interest
here,
your
honor,
and
the
preservation
of
that
--
of
that
relationship
which
we
say
the
statute
has
--
not
in
so
many
words,
but
the
statute
has
implicitly
recognized.
and
since
the
statute
implicitly
recognized
it,
we
think
that
is
one
that
is
entitled
to
protection
under
the
statute
as
against
the
union's
whipsawing
selective
strikes
which
is
designed
--
which
are
designed
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
prohibits.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
because
we
think
that
there
has
been
injected
into
this
situation,
something
which
is
not
to
be
found
in
the
case
of
this
single
employer,
namely,
the
integrity
of
this
bargaining
relationship
which
we
say
the
union
has
implicitly
recognized.
and
the
union
must
take
the
bitter
with
the
sweet
there
again,
certain
advantages
from
this
relationship
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
i
think
is
an
argument
that's
been
advanced
by
the
party.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i'm
trying
to
duck
it
because
i
think
that
it
doesn't
square
with
the
facts
of
this
case.
and
also
because
i
have
no
enlightenment
from
the
board
as
to
what
its
position
would
be
on
that.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
certainly,
not.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it's
a
fair
statement.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
your
honor,
we
had
consented
in
having
10
minutes
of
our
time
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i'm
afraid
i
have
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
you
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
mr.
chief
justice,
i
regret
that
i
misread
the
signal
for
my
--
precluded
general
royall
in
representing
one
of
the
amici
from
10
minutes
of
our
time
which
we
consented.
i
hope
the
court
can
see
fit
to
give
him
a
few
minutes.
