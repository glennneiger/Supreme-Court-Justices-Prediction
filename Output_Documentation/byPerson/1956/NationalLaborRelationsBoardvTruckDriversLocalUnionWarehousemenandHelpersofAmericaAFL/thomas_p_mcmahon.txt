mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
it
seemed
to
me
to
underscore
the
problem
as
the
board's
position
before
this
court
because
while
there
is
a
considerable
doubt,
both
reflected
in
the
legislative
history
and
by
all
of
the
writers
in
the
field
whether
or
not
multi-employer
bargaining
is
good
at
all.
this
--
the
board
is
now
asking
this
court
to
make
a
legislative
judgment
that
it
is
--
that
multi-employer
bargaining
is
not
only
good
but
it
is
so
good
that
we're
going
to
give
them
special
privileges
not
accorded
to
the
individual
employer
to
encourage
and
foster
this
type
of
bargaining.
now,
i
believe
it's
worthy
of
restating
some
of
the
basic
facts
because
while
the
facts
are
briefed
i
think
in
this
case,
as
in
every
case,
they
are
crucial.
there
is
an
unincorporated
association
composed
of
eight
or
nine
employers
who
are
in
the
laundry
and
dry
cleaning
business.
and
their
field
of
operations
extends
from
niagara
falls
and
niagara
county
on
the
north
through
buffalo
and
erie
county
down
to
dunkirk
and
cattaraugus
county,
along
the
western
pier
of
the
state
of
new
york.
and
contrary
to
the
opinion
in
the
dissenting
opinion
below,
this
does
not
constitute
the
metropolitan
area
of
the
city
of
buffalo.
i
don't
know
if
the
matter
is
crucial
to
this
court,
but
i
think
if
it
is,
it's
an
often
notorious
and
undisputed
fact
that
it
is
not
part
of
the
metropolitan
area
of
buffalo.
furthermore,
the
exchange
bargains
with
local
449
who
represents
the
truck
driver
employees
also
bargains
with
other
unions.
so
if
it
is
at
all
crucial
when
we
talk
about
25
employees
of
each
employer,
we
are
only
talking
about
25
truck
driver
employees
and
we're
not
talking
about
those
other
employees
who
were
engaged
in
the
actual
laundry
and
dry
cleaning
business.
now,
in
april
of
1952,
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
was
entered
into
between
local
449
and
the
exchange.
and
the
terms
of
the
agreement
affixed
a
one-year
term
with
the
60-day
notice
substantially
in
the
words
of
the
statute.
the
expiration
date
was
april
30
of
1953.
the
union
served
its
notice
some
time
in
february.
the
employer
served
no
notice.
so
that
some
time
in
march,
the
union
began
bargaining
with
the
exchange
and
the
bargaining
continued
all
the
way
through
april,
all
the
way
through
march,
all
the
way
through
april
until
finally
on
the
26th
day
of
may,
there
was
a
strike
of
the
truck
driver
employees
at
frontier
linen,
one
of
the
members
of
the
exchange.
and
at
that
night,
the
exchange
and
the
individual
employers
who
were
its
components
said,
"we're
laying
off.
we,
the
non-struck
employers,
are
laying
off
our
employees.”
“why
are
you
laying
them
off?”
“we're
laying
them
off
because
of
the
strike
at
frontier.”
“when
would
you
let
them
go
back
to
work?”
“we'll
let
them
go
back
to
work
when
you
stop
that
strike
at
frontier
and
you
withdraw
the
picket
line
at
frontier."
the
employers
never
claimed
that
any
economic
or
operative
problems
existed
at
their
plant.
they
never
asked
the
union
or
anybody
else
or
their
own
employees,
do
you
intend
to
strike
us.
they
didn't
care.
because
if
you'll
read
the
record
when
the
trial
examiner
asked
the
attorney
for
the
exchange,
"do
you
have
something
to
say
about
this?"
he
said,
"we
--
we
admit
that
we
did
what
we
did.
the
only
thing
we
say
is
that
because
we're
a
multi-employer
unit,
we
have
a
right
as
a
matter
of
law
to
do
it."
and
perhaps
that
gets
us
to
the
heart
of
the
matter.
well
then,
during
the
ensuing
week,
the
--
the
union
and
the
individual
employers
asked
this
corporation,
these
various
corporations,
to
let
us
go
back
to
work
in
the
same
terms
and
conditions.
and
again,
they
were
refused
and
again,
the
reason
was
given,
“not
until
you
stop
that
strike
at
frontier.”
and
they
never
asked
the
individual
employees
whether
or
not
they
ever
voted
for
the
strike.
now,
this
business
about
whipsaw
and
all
this
other
successive
and
so
forth
seems
to
me
to
add
nothing
but
--
but
vituperative
effort,
that's
to
the
whole
matter.
the
second
circuit
never
agreed
that
there
was
any
substantial
evidence
to
support
such
a
proposition
of
successive
whipsawing
so
on
and
so
forth.
is
it
--
indeed
the
trial
examiner
found
--
well,
and
we
say
this
that
the
language
of
the
second
circuit
was
that
i
suppose
that
it
was
reasonable.
it
was
reasonable
because
of
the
past
history
of
bargaining.
it
was
reasonable
to
infer
a
threat
to
strike.
but
there's
one
other
factor
what
seems
to
me
to
be
of
some
significance
and
that
is
that
there
was
the
--
the
trial
examiner
at
record
page
27,
disturbs
the
basic
premise
of
the
board's
argument
before
this
court
because
the
trial
examiner,
found
at
page
27
of
the
record
in
distinguishing
this
case
from
the
morand
case
and
the
davis
furniture
cases
decided
by
the
seventh
and
ninth
circuit
respectively,
he
said,
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
the
argument
that
the
strike
at
frontier
was
in
support
of
demands
common
to
all.
i
paraphrase
them
but
i
think
the
record
substantially
bears
that
out.
so
there
is
no
proof
here.
and
this
court
has
before
it
the
same
record
that
the
board
had
before
it,
that
the
second
circuit
had
before
it
and
that
the
trial
examiner
heard,
there
is
no
proof.
and
how
can
one
extract
from
it
and
even
allowing
the
board,
the
expertness
to
which
the
congress
says
it's
entitled.
how
can
they
make
such
an
inference
of
fact?
because
there
is
nothing
--
there
is
no
facts
there
to
support
such
an
inference.
so
we
come
then
to
the
basic
proposition
that
this
was
protected
concerted
activity.
and
the
trial
examiner
so
found
and
the
board
so
found
and
that
it
was
entitled
to
protection
under
the
act
and
there
is
an
agreement
between
the
parties
at
least
that
the
activity
of
the
non-struck
employers
in
laying
off
there
employees
was
unlawful
because
it's
in
clear
violation
of
the
language
of
sections
8
(a)
(1)
and
8
(a)
(3).
8
(a)
(1)
because
it
interfered
with
concerted
protected
activity.
it's
in
violation
of
8
(a)
(3)
because
it's
discriminatory.
the
argument
that
it's
not
discriminatory
because
you
layoff
all
the
employees
is
again
the
same
threat
of
argument
that
if
you
do
something
in
a
large
enough
scale
it
somehow
becomes
all
right.
it's
the
way
they
use
to
solve
wage
inequity
problems
in
the
old
days.
if
someone
complained
about
a
wage
inequity,
they
would
cut
everybody
down
to
the
lowest
level
and
therefore,
no
inequity.
and
so
here,
lay
them
all
off,
therefore,
no
discrimination.
so
then
--
i
don't
want
to
--
to
pass
on
problems
that
are
not
raised
by
the
parties.
but
i
do
think
this
question
of
the
board's
experience
is
worthy
of
some
comment.
judge
harlan
asked
on
thursday
if
this
matter
had
ever
been
considered
by
the
board
before.
well,
the
--
my
answer
is
yes,
your
honor,
it
was
considered
in
the
morand
case
on
remand
very
extensively
by
the
board.
it
was
considered
in
the
davis
furniture
case
by
the
board
extensively.
it
was
considered
by
the
board
extensively
in
continental
baking
company
case,
a
matter
that
came
before
the
eighth
circuit.
it
was
considered
by
the
board
as
recently
as
august
of
1956,
the
new
board,
if
we
--
it
can
be
so
termed.
and
they
had
no
trouble
arriving
at
the
problem
that
there
was
no
equation
between
strikes
and
lockouts
because
if
the
board
--
if
there
is
such
an
equation,
then
the
result
is
obvious,
the
strike
is
foredoomed.
the
board
in
its
decision
on
the
remand
case
from
which
i
acquired
heavily
in
my
brief
and
recited
that
length
in
my
brief
said
that
the
--
the
equation
of
strikes
and
lockouts
in
the
statute
in
every
sense
is
used
in
a
sense
where
strike
activity
is
proscribed.
and
to
draw
the
inference
that
by
proscribing
lockouts
in
8
(d),
it
makes
all
other
lockouts
lawful
by
the
same
token,
one
can
say,
that
all
other
strikes
are
lawful.
and
while
a
reductio
ad
absurdum
applies
in
both
cases
and
i
think
it
is
a
valid
argument.
because
if
the
court
is
asked
to
say
that
all
other
lockouts
are
legal,
then
all
other
strikes
are
legal.
but
in
--
an
examination
of
the
legislative
history
it
shows
that
what
was
really
intended,
if
any
clear
intent
can
be
defined
from
8
(d),
was
that
according
to
senator
ball,
we
want
to
prevent
quickie
--
“quickie
strikes."
and
as
the
same
expression
of
intent
is
reflected
by
senator
taft,
what
we
want
to
do
is
not
to
impair
the
right
to
strike,
but
what
we
want
to
do
is
to
preserve
that
right
until
after
there
has
been
a
reason
of
a
lot
of
opportunity
for
the
parties
to
reconcile
their
differences
which
was
the
same
expression
that
there
are
the
same
feeling
that
senator
taft
had
throughout
his
dissatisfaction
with
the
way
the
unions
themselves
were
constituted.
and
he
felt
that
by
imposing
a
waiting
period
that
the
matter
would
be
more
amicably
resolved.
the
board
adopts
another
thesis.
they
say
that
if
the
multi-employer
unit
doesn't
have
the
right
to
strike
out,
to
lock
out,
then
they'll
all
be
destroyed.
but
there
is
no
proof
in
the
records
that
these
employers
were
economically
weak.
he
never
claimed
any
such
thing.
he
never
said
that
there
was
any
accretive
problems.
they
just
said
that
they've
got
a
right
to
do
it.
and
the
--
the
hypothetical
that
mr.
justice
black
posed
in
saying
that
they
were
just
going
to
improve
their
bargaining
position
by
locking
out
is
not
before
this
court
at
all
because
they
never
said
that
that
was
their
purpose.
they
said
what
their
purpose
was
and
somebody
said
something
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
they
said
that
their
purpose
was
that
they
were
--
they
were
laying
off
their
employees
because
of,
"because
of
the
strike
at
frontier."
and
they
never
served
any
notice
so
they
had
no
purpose.
they
were
satisfied
with
the
status
quo.
they
never
served
any
notice
under
8
(d).
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
well,
i
have
four
briefs
amicus.i
don't
want
to
get
any
--
start
any
other
problems
that
haven't
been
raised
here.
but
i
think
it
all
depends
and
the
situation
of
an
employer
that
the
cases
recited
in
--
remember
murdock's
decision,
where
he
--
the
duluth
bottling
company
case
and
a
few
of
those
other
types
of
cases
where
there
were
unusual
economic
circumstances.
i
don't
agree
with
those.
they're
--
the
duluth
bottling
company
case
is
invidiously
referred
to
as
just
to
the
destruction
of
a
few
cans
of
maple
syrup.
well,
if
that
are
--
those
are
the
facts
of
the
case,
then
i
disagree
with
it
too.
but
i
think
in
the
steel
strike,
for
example,
it's
traditional
that
the
steelworkers
leave
somebody
behind
so
if
they're
going
to
shut
the
thing
down,
the
whole
capital
equipment
of
the
employer
isn't
going
to
be
destroyed.
and
they
say
that
each
of
us
are
going
to
be
shut
off
from
the
economic
market
but
we're
not
going
to
destroy
the
golden
egg.
now,
if
an
employer
faced
with
such
a
problem
as
that,
i
think
that
they
are
present
in
a
somewhat
different
situation.
but
now,
if
you
say
that
the
real
question
is
i
suppose
is
that,
well,
i'm
going
to
lock
you
out
because
i
think
if
you're
a
little
bit
hungrier,
you'll
be
more
willing
to
accept
my
terms.
well,
i
think
that
that's
a
clear
violation
of
the
proscriptions
contained
in
sections
8
(a)
(1)
and
8
(a)
(3).
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
well,
perhaps
the
only
advantage
that
i
can
see
from
multi-employer
bargaining
contrary
to
what
the
board
says
and
they
know
better,
and
i'll
come
to
it
a
moment,
is
that
it's
simpler.
instead
of
each
one
sitting
down
with
the
group
of
employers
and
doing
it,
spread
over
52
weeks,
i
think
is
probably
a
little
easier
in
some
circumstances
to
sit
down
and
do
it
over
--
do
it
all
together
in
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
economy
of
time.
it's
the
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
it's
the
only
one
i
can
see.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
in
the
present
state
of
the
economy.
i
don't
know.
i'm
not
speaking
out
what
the
situation
was
back
in
the
1930's
when
the
other
organizational
activity
was
going
on.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
but
certainly
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
well,
perhaps
it's
more
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
--
basic
than
that
because
section
8
(b)
(4)
says
that
a
union
can't
force
an
employer
into
a
multi-employer
bargaining
group.
they
can't
do
it
even
if
they
wanted
to,
even
if
a
union
thought
that
multi-employer
bargaining
was
a
good
thing,
they
can't
do
it.
it's
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
it's
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
them
to
do
it.
yes,
it
is
conceivably
possible
to
do.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
only
where
the
union
has
coerced
them.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
if
--
if
an
employer
--
if
the
union
comes
to
an
employer
and
says
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
that's
bad.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
as
i
see
it
right
now.
because
certainly
a
union
isn't
protected
as
the
board
would
say
by
--
from
rating
activities
because
if
you
look
at
the
cases
cited
at
page
7
of
the
brief
amicus
filed
by
the
exchange,
mr.
royall,
to
look
at
those
cases
at
page
7
of
their
brief,
they
cite
four
cases.
and
they
say,
furthermore,
contrary
to
the
assertion
of
the
court
of
appeals
below,
the
board
has
refused
to
allow
members
as
well
as
union
members
to
withdraw
from
a
group
while
a
contract
is
being
negotiated.
they
cite
four
cases.
now,
in
purity
stores
limited
and
engineering
metal
products
company
limited,
the
companies
were
not
permitted
to
withdraw
because
it
wasn't
at
the
negotiation
time.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
well,
i
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
well,
it
can
be
very,
very
good.
it
can
be
very,
very
bad.
i'll
say
this
that
you
will
get
some
employers
who
--
because
they
see
their
competitors
paying
the
--
the
wage
rate
are
more
disposed
to
pay
the
same
rate
--
wage
rate
because
they
feel
that
their
labor
cost
are
the
same
as
their
competitors.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
well,
if
they
know
that
the
fellow
is
doing
business
across
the
street
or
down
the
state
is
paying
the
same
as
he's
paying,
that
it
--
it
isn't
so
bad
to
get
a
little
bit
more
that
he
would
be
willing
to
pay.
there
is
that
advantage.
but
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
but
that's
balanced
by
the
possibility,
equally
likely,
that
the
union
might
end
up
by
all
of
them
taking
an
adamant
position
along
with
the
line
with
the
fellow
who
is
willing
to
depress
wages.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
the
risk
you
take.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
yes.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
yes,
sir.
then,
what
the
employer
makes
the
same
determination
whether
it's
good
enough
for
him
and
he
can
get
out
anytime
he
wants
to
without
any
--
well,
he
can
get
out
at
anytime
there
isn't
a
contract
in
session.
he
has
to
have
no
reason
at
all.
so
why
can
the
board
say
that
it's
appropriate
this
--
for
12
and
to
bargain
together
but
it
--
it's
still
appropriate
if
the
employer
withdraws.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
i
--
i
agree
sir.
but
i
think
that
the
union
ought
to
have
the
same
rights
as
the
employer
has
and
i
think
that
they
ought
to
make
a
business
judgment
that
may
be
it
doesn't
make
sense
for
us
to
strike
them
all.
maybe
we'd
be
better
off
just
striking
one.
well,
for
one
reason
or
another,
we
think
it
would
be
the
most
effective.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
that's
a
business
judgment.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
oh,
it
--
it
shows
the
unfairness
of
the
board's
position
and
that
was
the
matter
that
judge
frank
treated
at
some
length.
he
said
that
to
him
there
was
no
problem
in
this
case
at
all
and
he
--
most
of
his
opinion
was
saying
--
pointed
out
that
the
board
would
have
a
--
that
there's
some
kind
of
an
estoppel
that
works
that
somehow
a
union
by
doing
business
with
a
multi-employer
group
loses
its
right
to
strike
one.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
yes.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
well,
the
board
in
answer
to
the
question
from
justice
black
said
that
they
had
a
right
to
do
it
somehow
from
--
from
their
authority
to
designate
what
an
appropriate
unit
was.
they
said
that
a
union
can't
withdraw
because
we
have
the
right
to
determine
what
an
appropriate
unit
is.
i
say
in
answer
to
that
is
that
if
an
employer
can
withdraw
as
they
concede
that
he
can
and
it
still
becomes
appropriate
for
him
to
bargain
with
the
union
vis-à-vis.
why
does
it
become
inappropriate
when
the
union
withdraws
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
--
and
chooses
to
bargain
vis-à-vis?
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
i
have
no
dispute
with
that
particular
problem.
i
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
well,
the
decision
was
never
made
by
the
congress
and
it
was
never
made
by
the
board.
it
was
made
by
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
and
the
--
the
board
did
not
resurrect
this
--
make
its
own
accommodation
but
accepted
that
of
the
ninth
circuit.
now,
it
would
just
seemed
to
me
that
when
you
have
the
board
in
three
cases,
the
morand,
the
davis
furniture,
and
it
was
both
muchly
litigated,
and
the
continental
case
deciding
that
there
was
no
such
policy
that
the
most
it
could
be
said
for
multi-employer
bargaining
is
that
it
could
be
tolerated
that
congress
never
meant
to
say
that
it
is
to
be
the
preferred
form
and
that
certain
rights
follow
from
it.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
yes.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
yes.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
does
it
--
do
you
think
it
necessarily
--
well,
you
will
ask
the
question.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
i
don't
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
it
would
be
equally
lawful.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
equally
lawful.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
no,
sir.
that's
been
--
not
--
does
not
--
not
as
i
defined
their
argument.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
yes.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
that's
exactly
their
argument,
all
or
none,
because
if
you
don't,
they're
going
to
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
his
finding
is
somewhat
ambiguous,
whether
or
not
there
was
an
--
he
did
not
make
a
specific
finding
that
there
was
an
impasse.
on
page
27
of
the
record,
he
said
that
this
case
is
distinguishable
from
the
davis
furniture
and
morand
decisions
at
least
in
the
courts
because
there
was
no
finding
here
of
an
impasse.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
judge
frank
said
that
they
had
bargained
all
through
march
and
april
and
most
of
may
and
that
there
was
an
impasse
and
the
majority
of
the
court
agreed
with
him.
and
he
cited
in
the
footnote,
i
think
it's
footnote
10
of
his
decision
that
though
--
the
trial
examiner
found
that
there
was
an
impasse.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
the
board's
position
is
--
makes
the
matter
somewhat
irrelevant.
they
say
that
there
is
something
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
because
the
union
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
there's
no
--
it
seems
to
me
at
least
no
problem
that
they
could
have
struck
the
law.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
well,
it
depends
--
it
depends
i
suppose
on
one's
point
of
view.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
my
opinion
was
that
there
was
an
impasse.
i
--
i
did
not
participate
in
this
particular
bargaining.
i
have
no
personal
knowledge
but
it
just
seems
to
follow
that
if
--
if
you
have
gotten
along
for
13
years
and
the
only
other
strike
that
you
had
is
a
one-day
strike
in
1949,
and
then
suddenly
in
1953,
after
bargaining
for
the
better
part
of
three
months,
you
suddenly
go
off
and
strike
one.
then,
i
think
it
seems
to
me
to
follow
that
there
was
an
impasse.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
well,
you
see
my
position
wouldn't
be
any
different
on
this
particular
case,
mr.
justice
reed,
for
this
reason
that
whether
there
is
a
certification
or
not
an
employer
can
get
out
anytime.he
can
get
out.
why
shouldn't
the
union
be
able
to
make
its
own
business
judgment
that
it
had
better
get
out?
and
while
something
has
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
well,
what
--
what
he
can
do
is
this.
they
say
that
a
union
is
protected
from
rating.
i
have
cited
in
my
decision,
i
believe
at
page
21,
two
charge
cases
issued
by
the
general
counsel.
let's
look
at
the
other
side
of
the
coin.
in
those
cases,
an
employer
was
a
member
of
a
multi-employer
group
for
eight
to
10
years.
now,
during
the
negotiation
session
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
yes,
sir,
they
were.
because
during
the
negotiation
time,
the
certification
petition
was
filed
by
union
b,
union
a
having
been
recognized
for
this
eight
to
10
years.
union
b
files
a
decertification
petition.
the
employer
withdraws
from
the
multi-employer
group
and
recognizes
union
b.
so,
how
can
a
union
by
joining
a
multi-employer
group
be
any
better
protected
against
rate
or
any
other
type
of
divisive
tactic,
then
they
would
if
they
were
dealing
with
them
alone
because
he
can
get
out
for
any
reason
or
no
reason
by
whim
or
caprice,
an
employer
can
withdraw
from
a
multi-employer
group.
so,
i
--
whether
it's
certified
or
not.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
because
they
say
that
it's
--
this
matter
is
voluntary,
because
that
--
now,
i
said
on
--
on
my
argument
and
my
colloquy
with
mr.
justice
frankfurter
is,
is
that
i
say
that
if
one
side
can
get
out,
why
shouldn't
the
other
side
be
able
to
get
out?
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
they
--
they
wanted
to
do
the
best
that
they
could.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
no,
sir.
i'll
answer
that
this
afternoon.
that
is
not
so.
that
what
the
union
was
trying
to
do
is
to
retain
all
the
benefits
of
the
multi-employer
group
and
yet
go
out
and
do
something
else,
mr.
frank
--
mr.
justice,
was
that
substantially
the
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
well,
i
know
not
as
artistically
as
you
would,
but
that
the
board
is
made
much
of
the
fact
that
the
union
continued
to
bargain
with
the
multi-employer
group.
well,
of
course,
they
had
no
choice
but
to
bargain
with
the
exchange
because
they
--
they
--
an
employer
can
say
to
a
union
under
8
(b),
(1)
(b)
or
at
least
a
union
is
restrained
from
saying
under
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
of
the
act.
i
don't
want
to
bargain
with
mr.
so-and-so.
i
want
to
bargain
with
you.
i
think
the
example
given
in
the
legislative
history,
93
cong.rec.3837
to
legislative
history
1012,
mr.
taft
says,
this
unfair
labor
practice
referred
to,
referring
to
8
(b)
(1)
(b),
is
not
perhaps
of
a
tremendous
importance
but
employees
cannot
say
to
their
employer,
we
do
not
like
mr.
x.
we
will
not
meet
with
mr.
x.
you
have
to
send
us
mr.
y.
this
has
been
done
and
so
a
union
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
i
believe
it
is
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
--
not
printed
anywhere.
i
can
explain
why
because
in
the
morand
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
well,
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
reads
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
i'm
reading
from
the
act
itself.
it's
not
printed
at
any
place
at
least
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
i'll
just
read
it
accurately.
it
shall
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
labor
organization
or
its
agents,
the
union,
to
restrain
or
coerce
and
be
an
employer
in
the
selection
of
his
representatives
for
the
purposes
of
collective
bargaining
or
the
adjustment
of
grievances.
so
the
union
cannot
say
to
an
employer,
"we
won't
--
we
want
to
bargain
with
you
personally."
he
says,
"no,
you
bargain
with
the
exchange."
how
can
--
what
--
what
could
the
union
possibly
do?
they
can't
hold
him
down
and
--
and
make
a
bargain
with
him
because
the
act
says,
the
union
has
no
right
to
say
so.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
there
is
a
distinction
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
no,
sir.
there
is
a
difference
between
a
personality
and
the
scope
of
the
bargaining.
an
employer
cannot
say
that
you
have
to
deal
with
my
men
from
the
exchange
and
therefore
deal
with
eight
or
12
unions
or
eight
or
12
employers.
but
he
can
say,
"you
have
to
deal
with
mr.
x."
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
so
that
the
argument
and
the
board
never
found
that
the
union
did
anything
to
the
contrary.
but
they
now
make
much
--
the
board
in
its
brief
now
not
in
its
decision
but
in
its
brief
now
they
say,
"well,
the
union
wanted
to
retain
all
the
advantages
because
they
dealt
with
the
association."
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
the
union's
position
was
one
of
indifference.
they
didn't
--
they
didn't
care
which
way
it
went.
they
were
going
to
get
the
best
contract
for
their
employees
and
in
recognizing
these
facts
apply
for
which
you
advert
to,
you
can't
--
when
you
bargain
all
the
way
through
march
and
all
the
way
through
april
and
finally
through
may,
you
--
the
--
the
negotiators
for
the
union
feel
tremendous
pressures
from
within.
what
are
we
doing
here?
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
i
don't
--
i'm
not
troubled
by
the
froud
because
the
union
was
not
troubled
by
any
philosophical
preference.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
they
didn't
care
is
the
answer.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
they
didn't
care
either
way.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
exactly.
they
didn't
care.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
in
fact,
everyone
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
we
were
bargaining
with
the
eight
as
a
group,
but
then
came
the
strike
in
frontier.
this
does
not
mean
that
the
union,
and
hence,
and
this
was
the
question
put
to
me.
this
does
not
mean
that
the
union
was
striking
at
frontier
in
support
of
its
demands
against
all,
solely
because
it
continued
to
meet
with
the
--
the
member
of
the
exchange.
it
met
with
the
member
of
the
exchange
because
the
act
prohibits
them
from
doing
anything
other
than
meeting
with
the
designated
representative
of
the
employer.
now
then,
the
question
is,
what
did
they
want
to
do.
what
did
the
union
want
to
do?
i
say
that
the
union
wanted,
as
mr.
justice
black
said,
to
get
the
best
deal
for
their
members
that
they
could,
regardless
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
--
with
whatever
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
with
all
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
well,
i
--
i'd
like
to
phrase
it
better
but
substantially,
the
--
the
answer
to
the
question
is
--
is
this.
that
the
employer
was
the
one
who
was
satisfied
with
the
existing
situation
and
that
is
why
it
pointed
up
in
the
facts
that
he
did
not
serve
his
notice.
he
was
satisfied
with
the
status
quo.
now,
the
union
had
to
get
something
out
of
them
and
they
spent
the
better
part
of
three
months
trying
to
get
it
out
of
them.
let
me
say
this,
out
of
all
eight
of
them,
nine
of
them.
now,
they
couldn't
do
it.
so
then,
they
made
this
business
judgment
which
i
say
that
they
have
the
entitlement
to
do
of
striking
one
of
them.
now,
somehow
in
your
question,
there
is
--
you
impute
some
unfairness
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
well,
if
you
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
well,
the
trial
examiner
in
the
board
in
the
second
circuit
are
all
up
in
agreement
that
what
the
union
did
is
right.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
that
not
only
that
it
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
well,
i
--
perhaps,
i
don't
understand
the
problems
but
i
wouldn't
think
that
this
court
would
have
set
such
a
problem
because
in
the
morand
case,
the
--
the
non-struck
employers
set
up
this
defense
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
and
other
appropriate
sections
of
the
act
and
they
said
you're
trying
to
change
our
bargaining
representative.
they
did
it
by
way
of
an
affirmative
defense,
so
i
wouldn't
think
that
this
court
would
now
raise
for
employers
an
affirmative
defense
anymore
than
they
would
raise
the
statute
against
frauds
and
perjuries
for
some
other
particular
client
or
--
or
proponent
who
came
before
this
court.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
well,
we
are
right
anyhow
because
everybody
agrees
that
no
matter
what
our
circuit
wish
was,
it
was
--
it
was
proper,
concerted,
protected
activity,
at
least
up
to
now
i
should
say.
and
everyone
seems
to
be
agreed
including
the
board
that
this
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
except
for
the
fact
that
there
is
a
multi-employer
group
involved.
and
our
position
has
been
and
is
now
that
there
is
nothing
mystical
about
a
multi-employer
group
and
that's
the
long
and
the
short
of
it.
furthermore,
we
say
that
the
most
that
can
be
taken
from
a
reading
of
the
--
the
legislative
history
is,
and
i
use
the
word
tolerated
which
perhaps
there
are
better
ones,
but
they
did
nothing
to
disturb
it.
the
house
majority
report
was
going
to
disturb
the
issue
and
all
these
arguments
directed
to
reciting
the
long
history
of
multi-employer
bargaining
long
before
the
wagner
act
or
any
of
the
other
legislation
of
the
late
20's
and
30's
that
there
was
multi-employer
bargaining.
the
house
majority
reports
said,
we
don't
care
that
if
it's
worked
out
and
if
some
dislocations
occur
as
a
result
of
it.
it's
bad.
and
the
reason
that
it's
bad,
at
least
to
one
that
i
submit
is
the
most
cogent,
there
are
number
of
other
reasons
advanced,
but
the
most
cogent
one
to
me,
advanced,
i'm
not
saying
whether
i
agree
with
it,
that's
not
my
burden
now
to
say
that
multi-employer
bargaining
is
good
or
bad.
but
with
the
house
majority
report
and
those,
the
more
persuasive
arguments
submitted,
was
that
it
is
going
to
bring
the
government
deeper
and
deeper
into
this
multi-employer
bargaining.
we
can
note
this
as
a
judicial
fact,
as
a
matter
of
judicial
notice
that
the
steel
unions
bargained
last
year
with
united
states
steel,
bethlehem
and
the
rest
of
them.
the
--
i
think
that
the
big
three
or
four.
now,
according
to
the
board's
reasoning,
there
is
no
certification
there.
there
is
no
certification
here.
by
the
board's
reasoning,
if
next
year
in
the
bargaining
or
at
the
next
time
that
they
do
bargain,
the
union
strikes
only
united
states
steel.
the
board
says
to
the
union,
you
might
as
well
strike
them
all
because
if
you
don't,
they
have
the
right
to
lay
you
off
anyway.
now,
this
was
the
type
of
thing
that
congress
was
much
distressed
about.
and
senator
ives
and
senator
morris
felt
that
--
there
were
others
too,
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
main
proponents
of
--
of
permitting
the
status
quo
said
that
it's
worked
out
pretty
well
in
many
circumstances
and
we
ought
to
leave
well
enough
alone.
and
i
quoted
very
extensively
from
what
--
in
my
brief
from
what
senator
ives
said.
senator
ives
admitted,
perhaps
not
the
ignorance
of
congress
but
the
not
knowingness
of
congress
about
this
problem.
and
there,
they
said
that
we
are
setting
up
section
402
of
title
iv
for
the
specific
reason
of
finding
out
why
and
how
this
thing
works
and
that
there
are
other
authorities
who
say
that
no
generalization
can
be
made
about
multi-employer
bargaining.
i've
quoted
some
of
them
here.
but
i
should
also
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
this
report
made
by
this
special
committee,
set
up
under
title
402
of
the
act
and
it's
not
in
my
brief.
it's
80th
congress
--
80th
cong.,
2nd
sess.,
rep.no.986,
pt.5,
and
this
was
after
an
investigation
of
the
west
coast
experience.
it's
rep.no.986
of
the
80th
cong.,
2nd
sess.
and
i
quote
from
their
conclusion,
"multi-employer
bargaining
has
in
different
industries
than
both
an
instrument
of
peace
and
of
war.
in
some
context
and
some
environments,
it
has
been
conducive
to
the
preservation
of
industrial
peace.
while
in
other
instances,
the
opposite
result
has
been
produced.
the
conclusion
seems
inevitable
that
it
is
not
multi-employer
bargaining
which
has
produced
either
result."
so,
whatever
the
great
authorities
in
the
field
seemed
to
feel
about
how
good
multi-employer
bargaining
is
the
only
evidence
that
we
have
from
this
committee
set
up
under
title
402
is
that
the
results
are
inconclusive.
and
other
matters
that
they
say
is
that
there
are
not
as
many
strikes
in
the
multi-employer
bargaining.
well,
that
--
perhaps
congress
isn't
so
impressed
by
that.
maybe
they
--
congress
would
look
at
the
magnitude
and
the
economic
dislocation
of
one
strike.
perhaps
to
use
--
since
all
of
these
arguments
bristle
with
phrases
of
war.
perhaps,
the
congress
feels
that
a
number
of
police
actions
are
better
than
one
major
catastrophe.
i
submit
at
least
that
that's
the
possibility.
but
i
--
that
the
bone
and
contention
of
my
argument
is
that
whether
multi-employer
bargaining
be
good
or
bad
is
for
the
congress
to
decide.
and
congress,
as
i
say,
has
said
neither,
it's
allowed
it
to
continue
but
the
congress
never
said
this.
the
congress
never
said
it's
so
good
that
we're
going
to
allow
an
employer
to
lockout
his
employees
solely
because
he
becomes
a
member
of
that
group.
i
say
that
what
the
congress
felt
was
that
they're
--
they're
to
be
treated
just
like
everybody
else
and
if
--
if
there
are
some
benefits
which
they
can
gain
from
this
form
of
bargaining,
fine.
if
there's
some
that
they
--
if
they
feel
that
it
is
now
become
unsatisfactory,
let
them
withdraw.
i
say
that
the
same
reasoning
applies
to
unions
and
that's
the
long
decision,
the
long
part
of
this
decision
that
justice
frank
in
--
in
his
decision
in
the
second
circuit
was
alluding
too.
he
said
that
--
and
that
he
was
--
the
bone
of
his
contention
was
is
this,
his
decision
is
very
simple.
this
activity
by
the
union
is
protected,
concerted
activity,
strike
activities,
concerted
activity
and
this
court
has
said
so
that
it
is
protected.
nobody
has
ever
said
to
the
contrary,
the
trial
examiner
so
found,
the
board
so
found
and
the
second
circuit
accepted.
this
activity
does
layoff
of
the
employees
is
a
clear
violations
of
the
plain
language
of
8
(a)
(1)
and
8
(a)
(3)
of
the
act.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
and
i
think
he
points
out
in
the
footnote
some
--
there
is
some
contradiction
between
what
he
says
in
the
footnote
and
what
the
trial
examiner
said.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
i
think
that
there
was
an
impasse.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
yes,
your
honor,
for
the
reasons
i
gave.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
but
i
--
as
i
say,
i
have
no
personal
knowledge
of
that.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
sure.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
an
employer
--
i
say
it
in
two
bases.
number
one,
i
say
that
the
distinction
between
destroying
a
union
and
defeating
a
strike
to
quote
the
language
of
this
professor
who
was
quoted
as
recommended
--
cited
as
recommended
reading
from
the
court
--
to
the
court
last
thursday.
he
--
he
says
that
that
distinction
is
absurd
because
to
go
back
to
the
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
i
don't
--
don't
like
to
use
extravagant
words
but
i
don't
think
there
is
a
valid
distinction,
no,
because
to
go
back
to
the
long
list
of
lockout
and
shutdown
cases
that
occurred
during
the
1930's,
all
of
which
were
before
the
congress
in
1947,
they
said,
you
can't
--
and
all
these
cases
said
in
substance,
i
am
paraphrasing.
you
can't
layoff
your
employees
to
defeat
an
organizational
activity.
now,
with
the
answer
of
--
in
any
different,
if
they
said,
"come
in
and
organize.
now,
i'm
going
to
layoff
until
such
time
as
we
get
a
satisfactory
agreement."
i
don't
think
that
there
was
a
difference,
your
honor,
between
--
i
don't
think
that
employers
are
disturbed
about
unions
because
many
of
them
are
content
with
company
unions.
but
what
they
don't
like
--
and
so
the
congress
has
found,
they
don't
like
barrel
unions,
unions
that
are
going
to
make
demands
at
them
--
upon
them
that
they
feel
are
unjust
or
unfair
or
going
to
put
an
economic
burden
on
them.
i
think
mr.
justice
hand
said
in
the
case
of
peter
cailler
kohler,
the
congress
waived
to
the
conflict
of
the
employer's
interest
with
his
employees
and
has
pro
tanto,
showing
of
his
powers.
that
--
that
--
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
no
valid
distinction
between
a
lockout
to
defeat
organizational
activity
and
a
lockout
to
--
to
defeat
concerted
activity.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
frontier.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
of
course,
they
didn't
close
its
stores.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
well,
frontier
did.
the
rest
of
them
just
laid
off
their
truck
driver
employees.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
no,
sir.
before,
it
said
--
there
was
a
shut
down
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
well,
i
--
i
tried
not
to
use
--
get
involved
in
the
words
lockout
or
layoff.
i
tried
to
talk
about
the
language
of
8
(a)
(1)
and
8
(a)
(3).
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
i'd
take
a
slightly
different
argument.
i
will
say
this
that
assuming
that
ford
motor
company
has
the
right
upon
a
strike
to
layoff
its
employees,
i
don't
--
i
say
this
that
ford
would
not
have
the
right
to
layoff
its
employees
merely
because
a
strike
at
general
motors
because
then
you
have
a
sympathetic
lockout.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
well,
let
me
--
i'm
assuming
some
knowledge
of
the
history
that
we
have
--
had
in
bargaining
in
the
automobile
industry.
and
that
the
history
has
been
that
each
time
they
--
they
take
general
motors
first,
then
they
seem
to
take
ford
and
then
chrysler
and
the
rest.
now
then,
ford
can
make
and
everyone
i
think
would
agree
that
a
strike
at
general
motors,
there
is
an
inference
that
can
reasonably
be
drawn
that
there's
going
to
be
a
strike
against
ford
just
like
here.
now,
what
i
say
is
and
the
board
agrees
that
absent
something
about
a
multi-employer
unit
that
ford
couldn't
lockout
merely
because
of
the
strike
at
--
at
general
motors.
i
don't
see
why
they
could.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
because
then
you're
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
i
think
we'd
have
to
stop
with
the
first
question
to
decide
whether
--
whether
that
first
one
is
so.
then,
if
--
if
the
first
one
is
--
if
the
first
premise
is
so
that
an
employer
has
a
right
to
layoff
his
employees
to
impoverish
them
so
that
he
can
get
a
better
bargain
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
--
then
the
next
--
then
the
premise,
the
series
of
premises
which
the
second
circuit
used
would
not
be
--
we
couldn't
follow
those
because
the
--
we
take
one
thing
out
of
the
chain,
then
you
would
have
to
say
--
then
the
argument
would
be,
well,
even
if
he
can
do
it
alone,
even
if
an
individual
employer
has
a
right
to
layoff
his
employees,
to
impoverish
them
so
he
can
get
a
better
bargain,
he
can't
do
it
in
support
or
to
--
as
--
as
a
condition
of
making
a
union
stop
striking
somebody
else
which
is
our
case
right
here.
i'm
not
sure
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
the
equation
of
strikes
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
i've
dealt
with
that
extensively
in
my
brief.
but
i
--
i
would
say
this
that
maybe
some
lockouts
are
permissible
and
--
and
for
that
--
that
question
i
think
is
not
before
the
court.
the
question
is
--is
--
if
i
would
have
the
procedure
be
and
i
--
i
would
persuade
you
if
i
could
that
this
is
the
approach
is
that
perhaps
the
wagner
act
said
nothing
about
lockouts.
well,
the
wagner
act
said
is
you
can't
violate
sections
8
(a)
(1)
and
8
(a)
(3)
and
the
state
did.
now,
whatever
you
--
you
choose
to
call
that
particular
kind
of
activity
with
the
type
of
shorthand
phrase
you
choose
to
use
to
label
it.but
all
we
say
is
--
says
--
the
wagner
act
says
is
that
you
can't
discriminate
you
can't
discourage
concerted,
protected
activities.
and
this
is
a
clear
violation
of
sections
8
(a)
(1)
and
8
(a)
(3)
on
the
language
on
its
face
and
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
which
i
have
cited.
i
would
also
say
this
that
the
distinction
between
a
layoff
or
something
to
defeat
organizational
activity
and
something
to
--
to
defeat
concerted,
protected
activity,
i
--
i
didn't
treat
that
at
some
length
--
at
any
length
in
my
brief.
in
fact,
i
didn't
treat
it
at
all.
but
i
--
i
would
say
this
that
the
phrase,
other
protected
activities
for
the
purposes
of
collective
bargaining
or
mutual
aid
or
protection,
from
my
study
of
the
statutes
first
appeared
in
the
norris-laguardia
act
and
the
purposes
clause.
and
the
norris-laguardia
act
was
distinguished
from
the
cases
decided
by
this
court,
the
adera
case
and
coppage
versus
kansas
which
were
criminal
cases,
one
federal
and
one
state
prohibiting
discriminations
against
unions.
and
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
wagner
act
or
not
of
the
wagner
act,
excuse
me,
but
in
section
7
of
its
predecessor
9
nira
of
the
national
industrial
recovery
act.
mr.
gompers,
who
had
been
so
disappointment
with
these
results
under
section
20
of
the
clayton
act
changed
the
language
of
the
committee
and
borrowed
almost
word
from
word
for
the
language
of
the
norris-laguardia
act,
which
said
--
he
norris-laguardia
act
says,
i
just
want
to
say
in
shorthand
fashion,
the
federal
courts
will
keep
out
of
this
business.
they
won't
make
day-to-day
judgments
which
are
half
judicial
and
half
legislative.
the
section
7
that
we
have
before
us
was
that
they
not
only
have
the
right
to
organize,
they
have
the
right
to
choose
representatives
of
their
own
choosing,
but
they
have
the
right
to
engage
in
other
protected,
concerted
activities
for
the
purposes
of
collective
bargaining
or
their
mutual
aid
and
protection.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
but
at
least
it's
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
well,
no.
i'd
--
i
say
this
is
not
only
concerted
activity
but
it
is
that
type
of
activity
for
the
improvement
of
wages,
hours
or
working
condition.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
but
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
but
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
means
which
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
well,
my
only
answer
to
that
is
that
i
don't
see
why
unions
or
employees
should
be
treated
any
differently.
and
i
don't
see
how
we
can
hear
in
a
judicial
form
make
a
legislative
judgment
that
now
because
they
are
in
--
because
employers
are
in
a
multi-employer
group,
they
are
ipso
facto
weaker
than
employees.
when
the
legislator
--
legislature
--
the
congress
has
made
the
judgment
as
they
did
in
the
wagner
act,
then
employees
are
weaker
than
employers.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
but
the
congress
--
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
but
the
congress
retained
that
judgment
in
--
in
the
legislation
of
1947.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
well,
insofar
as
the
--
who
is
the
weaker,
the
congress
said
at
least
in
their
findings
said
so,
now
whether
they
meant
it
or
not
is,
i
suppose
is
what
we're
here
for.
but
the
congress
said
that
employees
are
weaker
than
employers
doing
business
in
the
form
of
corporations
or
associations.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
what
i'm
saying
though,
your
honor,
is
that
the
board
can
or
cannot
say
that
just
because
you
have
a
multi-employer
group
that
the
employers
are
weaker.
mr.
thomas
p.
mcmahon
well,
i
--
that's
--
i'm
arguing
that
point
and
the
