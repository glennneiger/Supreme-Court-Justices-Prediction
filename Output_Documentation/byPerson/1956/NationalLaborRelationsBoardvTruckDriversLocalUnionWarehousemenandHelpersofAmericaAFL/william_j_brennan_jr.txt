justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
tell
me
mr.
manoli,
as
i
gather
it,
the
board
power
that
--
actually,
this
was
a
whiplashing
technique,
i
think
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
per
se.
and
the
court
said
that
on
the
contrary
that
it
was
a
withdrawal
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
from
the
arrangement.
now
are
they
fact
findings?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
when
you
don't
urge
that
those
are
contrary
to
finding
a
fact
in
--
by
the
court
from
that
which
by
the
board?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
manoli,
i
--
i
don't
follow
--
i
--
i
gather
there
was
no
unit
determination
in
this
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
obviously,
it
wouldn't
be
because
i
think
you
told
us
there's
no
formal
board
certification
as
regards
to
any
employer
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
how
--
how
does
this
business
of
board
law
about
withdrawal
either
of
union
or
employer
from
the
arrangement
concern
us
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
--
may
i
declare
in
my
own
mind
that
this
board
law
that
you
described
for
us
is
applicable
only
in
a
circumstance
in
which
there
has
been
a
formal
unit
determination
by
the
board
in
a
certification
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
say
usually
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
am
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
am
i
wrong
in
my
impression
that
the
board
is
never
required
to
make
any
--
to
recognize
or
accept
a
unit
determination
made
by
the
parties
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--necessarily?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
--
that
being
the
fact,
then
wouldn't
it
follow
that
the
whole
issue
of
board
law
would
be
pertinent
only
in
a
case
where
there
had
been
a
determination
of
appropriate
unit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
bothers
me
is
--
i
gather
from
what
you
just
said
that
it
would
be
possible
even
though
there
had
not
been
a
determination
formally
of
an
appropriate
unit
for
the
board
to
apply
this
law
that
you
described
for
us?

j.

(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
that
connection,
may
i
ask,
mr.
mcmahon,
this
comes
back
to
the
question
i
asked
you
before
recess.
in
your
support
of
the
opinion
below,
do
you
dispute
this
sentence
at
page
51?
in
any
event,
we
think
that
the
union
here
met
the
task
established
by
the
board
in
the
morand
case.
that
is
an
impasse
in
the
bargaining
with
the
association
had
been
reached
before
the
union
called
the
strike
at
frontier.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i'm
asking
whether
you
support
