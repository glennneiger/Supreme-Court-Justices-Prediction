--
as
a
result
of
their
negotiations,
did
they
enter
--
did
the
union
enter
into
one
contract
with
the
association
or
did
it
enter
into
individual
contracts
with
the
various
employers
in
the
association?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
--
do
you
attach
any
significance
to
whether
it
was
one
way
or
the
other,
namely,
if
the
union
bargained
for
the
employees
and
all
of
the
plants
and
made
one
contract
and
the
association
did
likewise
is
therein
as

these
individual
contracts?

just
one
more
question,
mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i
thought
i
understood
you
just
say
that
the
union
could
not
withdraw
from
its
agreement.

members
of
the
employer
association
withdraw?
chief
justice
earl

wish
you
would.

justice
earl
warren

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
manoli,
before
we
get
on
to
that
question,
i
--
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
employer
could
withdraw
at
any
time.
did
you
mean
just
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
well,
i
just
want
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
not
of
course
during
a
lifetime
of
the
contract?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mcmahon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
your
time
is
up.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
your
hour
is
up.
chief
justice
earl
warren
most
considerably
up.
i
am
afraid
we've
got
no
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mcmahon.
chief
justice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
think
you're
asking
an
indulgence
that
we
don't
grant,
as
you
know
mr.
manoli,
you
were
--
you
were
advised.
i
saw
the
light
come
on.
i
wondered
if
you
were
going
to
continue,
but
general
royall
asked
for
time
to
argue
in
this
case.
it
was
denied
but
we
did
give
to
him
and
give
to
all
the
associations
in
the
country
the
right
to
file
briefs.
and
you
knew
that
you
could
give
him
such
time
as
you
wanted
of
your
time,
you
used
all
the
time,
i'm
afraid
we'll
have
to
go
on.
