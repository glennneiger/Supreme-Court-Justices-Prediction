justice
john
m.
harlan
in
fact,
it
reserved
this
issue
on
the
question
of
the
legality
of
a
bargaining
lockout
in
the
hands
of
an
individual
employer
who
is
not
a
member
of
an
association.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
your
view
about
that?
i
noticed
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
makes
a
very
strong
argument.
there's
nothing
wrong
in
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
you
explain
why
the
individual
whipsawing
technique,
as
you
call
it,
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
is
against
the
strike,
against
all
of
the
members?
what
--
what's
so
effective
about
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
didn't
mean
to
characterize
this
an
unfair
labor
practice,
but
what
--
why
is
--
why
--
why
is
the
--
why
can
the
individual
members,
the
non-struck
employers
in
the
collective
bargaining
arrangement
of
this
kind,
associating
arrangement,
why
can
they
strike,
why
can
they
lockout
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
when
there
is
an
individual
strike,
whereas
i
take
it
it's
implicit
in
your
argument
that
the
union
struck
all
of
them,
they
couldn't
lockout.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
they
try
to
strike
against
those?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
still
don't
understand
why
a
--
it's
all
right
for
a
non-struck
employer
to
gain
a
lockout
against
the
threat
of
the
strike
and
i
take
it's
implicit
in
your
argument
that
there
had
been
no
multi-employer
unit
here.
there
would
be
lockout
and
not
have
been
about
a
lockout,
not
a
proper
lockout.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
question
i
put
to
you
last
thursday
and
you
said
you
didn't
want
to
express
your
view
for
the
board.
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
right,
now
assuming
for
the
moment
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
that
that
unanswered
question
would
be
answered
against
the
right
to
lockout.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
say
you
don't
have
to
reach
that
question
because
here
you've
got
a
multi-employer
unit.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
my
question
is
what
is
it
that
makes
the
lockout
all
right
when
the
threat
is
against
the
multi-employer
unit
as
represented
by
a
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
strike
against
one
whereas
it
would
be
all
right,
my
hypothesis,
against
the
single
individual?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i'm
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
asking
you
what
those
are
because
the
union
here
did
continue
to
bargain
with
the
multi-employer
unit.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
supposing
the
--
supposing
the
union
here
and
instead
of
striking
as
one
employer
had
served
notice
on
all
of
them.
we're
going
to
strike
next
tuesday.
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
the
lockout
have
been
all
right
by
all
of
them,
just
--
without
--
any
further
showing,
would
the
lockout
have
been
all
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
think
you
can't
duck
that
question
and
that's
basic
to
the
whole
proposition,
unless
you
can
show
me
some
reason
why
there's
some
magic
in
the
threat
going
to
a
group
rather
to
an
individual.
justice
john
m.
harlan
didn't
the
--
didn't
the
court
of
appeals
find,
didn't
judge
frank
say,
it
wasn't
the
premise
of
his
decision
that
the
strike
against
this
one
employer
was
the
equivalent
of
a
threat
to
all
the
others?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
that
--
wasn't
that
premise?
what
are
you
arguing?
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
right.
now,
my
question
is
what
--
why
--
why
it
is
that
you
make
the
threat
whether
it's
direct
or
by
implications
through
a
strike
of
this
kind
against
an
individual?
that
kind
of
a
lockout
is
all
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
mean
a
sort
of
an
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
could
i
put
this
question
to
you?
in
essence,
your
position
is
once
you
got
a
multi-employer
unit
that
presupposes
that
there's
going
to
be
good
faith
bargaining
with
the
unit
as
distinguished
from
individual
members
of
it,
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
being
so,
then
if
the
--
the
union
strikes
against
one,
why
isn't
that
a
refusal
to
bargain
in
good
faith
with
the
multi-employer
unit
and
as
such
is
an
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
you
kind
of
ducked
that
one
every
time
when
i'm
trying
to
get
a
hold
of
something
that
i
can
(voice
