mr.
dominick
l.manoli
if
the
court
please,
this
case
is
hereon
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
court
below
dismissed
an
order
of
the
board,
to
set
aside
an
order
of
the
board,
dismissing
a
complaint
involving
that
the
employers
involved
in
this
case
had
laid
off
their
employees
in
violations
of
the
--
violation
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
a
group
of
employees
who
have
been
dealing
with
the
union
representing
their
employees
through
an
association
for
the
purpose
of
arriving
in
an
agreement
covering
all
of
the
employers
may
lawfully
suspend
operations
without
violating
the
national
labor
relations
act.
when
the
union
strikes,
one
of
the
employer
members
of
the
association
and
that
strike
carries
with
it
the
implicit
threat
of
--
of
successive
strikes
against
the
other
employer
members
of
the
association.
the
facts
in
this
case
were
stipulated
by
the
parties
and
i
may
very
briefly
summarize
them.
the
employers
in
this
case
are
some
linen
supply
companies
located
in
buffalo,
dunkirk,
and
niagara
falls,
new
york.
they
are
linen
supply
companies
and
i
suppose
another
word
might
be
the
term,
laundries.
they
each
employed
truck
drivers
ranging
in
number
from
two
to
22
--
22
men.
these
truck
drivers
in
turn
are
represented
for
purposes
of
bargaining
by
the
respondent
union.
and
the
employers
here
have
been
represented
for
some
13
years
for
purposes
of
collective
bargaining
by
an
association
called
the
linen
and
credit
exchange.
the
linen
and
credit
exchange
had
carried
on
negotiations
with
the
respondent
union
and
the
practice
has
been
during
these
past
13
years
for
the
association
and
the
union
to
negotiate
--
seek
to
negotiate
an
agreement.
in
the
event
that
they
arrived
at
such
an
agreement,
then
this
agreement
is
in
turn
submitted
to
the
employer
members
of
the
association.
and
if
a
majority
of
these
employer
members
of
the
association
approved
that
the
agreement
then
all
of
them
signed.
now,
in
march
of
1953,
the
association
and
the
union,
consistent
with
this
practice,
entered
into
negotiations
for
a
contract
to
succeed
the
existing
of
current
contract
which
was
to
expire
in
april
of
that
year.
they
negotiated
for
several
weeks
and
after
several
weeks
of
negotiations,
they
were
unable
to
arrive
in
an
agreement.
and
in
may,
sometime
in
may,
the
union
called
a
strike
against
the
frontier
linen
supply
company.
the
frontier
linen
supply
company
is
one
of
the
eight
employer
members
of
this
linen
exchange
--
linen
and
credit
exchange
of
this
employer
bargaining
association.
and
thereupon,
the
union
placed
the
picket
line
around
the
premises
of
the
frontier
linen
company.
the
other
--
the
employees
of
the
other
employers
remained
at
work
but
on
the
following
day,
however,
the
other
seven
employer
members
of
the
association
suspended
operations,
laid
off
their
employees
and
at
the
same
time,
they
notified
the
--
they
notified
the
respondent
union
that
they
would
resume
operations
when
the
union
called
off
its
strike
against
frontier
and
also
remove
the
picket
line
at
that
place.
following
the
calling
of
the
strike
against
frontier
by
the
union,
and
following
the
suspension
of
operations
by
the
other
seven
employer
members
of
the
association,
the
union
and
the
association
continue
to
bargain,
continue
to
negotiate
for
the
purpose
of
arriving
in
an
agreement.
and
within
the
week,
or
by
the
end
of
the
week,
they
did
arrive
in
such
an
agreement
which
was
satisfactory
to
the
employers,
and
thereupon,
the
union
called
off
the
strike
and
the
--
all
of
the--
all
the
seven
employers
who
with
suspended
operations,
as
well
as
frontier
linen
company,
resumed
operations
and
the
men
returned
to
work.
the
board
and
the
court
below,
upon
these
facts,
agreed
that
the
strike
against
frontier,
one
of
the
eight
employer
members
of
the
association,
carried
with
it
the
implicit
threat
of
successive
strikes
against
the
other
employer
members
of
the
association.
the
board
concluded
that
this
selective
whipsawing
strike
technique
was
calculated
to
destroy
the
employer
solidarity,
the
employer
collective
bargaining
position
if
you
will,
which
is
the
--
which
in
the
board's
view
is
the
principal
purpose
for
their
entering
into
this
multi-employer
bargaining
relationship.
in
the
board's
view,
this
unity,
the
preservation
of
this
collective
bargaining
position
is
entitled
to
protection
under
the
statute,
and
to
that
end,
the
employers
against
whom
--
the
employers
may
suspend
operations
and
counter
with
concerted
action,
the
selective
strike
by
the
union
against
one
of
their
members,
the
purpose
of
which,
of
course,
is
to
bring
about
a
capitulation
of
the
entire
group.
the
court
below,
on
the
other
hand,
disagreed
with
this
conclusion
on
two
grounds.
first,
it
concluded
that
the
strike
against
frontier
was
tantamount
to
a
withdraw
by
the
union
from
the
multi-employer
bargaining
relationship
which
had
existed
for
some
13
years.
on
that
premise,
the
court
said
there
was
no
basis
for
differentiating
between
an
individual
employer
and
an
employer
who
is
the
member
of
an
association
that,
in
either
case,
where
an
employer
suspends
operations
in
anticipation
of
a
strike,
he
is
engaging
an
unfair
labor
practice
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
--
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
secondly,
the
court,
meeting
the
board
upon
its
own
ground,
concluded
that
the
employers'
interest
in
preserving
their
solidarity
and
preserving
their
bargaining
position
as
against
the
union
was
not
--
has
not
been
given
--
given
a
such
recognition
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
to
permit
the
accommodation
in
which
the
board
has
made
in
this
case.
accordingly,
the
court
below,
as
i've
indicated
before,
set
aside
the
board's
order
would
dismiss
the
complaint
against
the
employers
here
and
remanded
the
case
to
the
board.
now,
at
the
outset,
i
think,
in
order
to
understand
more
clearly
the
issue
which
is
involved
in
this
case,
i
think
it
is
important
to
deal
with
the
initial
premise
of
the
decision
below,
namely,
that
the
strike
called
by
the
union
against
the
frontier
company
was
tantamount
to
a
withdrawal
by
the
union
from
the
multi-employer
bargaining
relationship
with
the
employers,
and
that
on
that
basis,
this
--
the
lockout
here
was
not
to
be
differentiated
from
a
lockout
by
an
individual
employer
who
is
not
a
member
of
an
association
and
who
suspends
operations
in
anticipation
of
a
strike.
the
board
itself
did
not
reach
that
issue
in
this
case?
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
well,
your
honor,
the
board
reserved
their
decision
in
this
case
and
hasn't
come
to
grips
with
it.
and
i,
as
the
spokesman
of
the
board,
i
have
no
views
until
the
board
speaks
on
that
matter.
but
whatever
the
answer
may
be
to
that,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
we
have
to
reach
that
question
in
this
case,
because
on
the
basis
of
the
record
in
this
case,
it
is
unnecessary
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
lockout
by
a
single
employer
gives
or
is
not
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
the
statute.
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
after
the
union
called
the
strike
against
frontier,
it
continued
to
negotiate
with
the
association
and
finally
arrived
in
agreement
with
the
association
for
all
of
the
employers.
there
is
no
suggestion
in
this
record
that
the
union
fall
under
strike
against
frontier
attempted
or
sought
or
intended
to
reach
individual
agreements
with
the
various
employers
as
might
have
been
the
case
if
the
union
had
sought
to
withdraw
from
this
relationship
which
had
existed
for
some
13
years.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
right.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
no,
sir.
i
think
the
court
below
said
in
effect
that
a
strike,
in
these
circumstances,
is
as
a
matter
of
law
a
withdraw
by
the
union.
and
then
in
connection
with
that,
you
may
--
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
no.
i
--
i'm
emerging
that
--
that
the
court
aired
in
viewing
the
strike
as
a
withdraw
that
realistically
the
strike
must
be
viewed
as
nothing
more
than
simply
a
tactical
maneuver
on
the
part
of
the
union
by
the
selective
--
by
selecting
each
employer
--
each
employer
one
at
a
time
as
a
tactical
maneuver
to
exploit
the
union
in
order
to
obtain
capitulation
by
the
entire
group.
now,
the
issue,
therefore,
as
we
see
it
in
this
case
is
whether
a
union
which
has
been
bargaining
upon
this
basis
may
squeeze
the
advantages
out
of
this
relationship
and
at
the
same
time
pick
all
of
each
employer
one
at
a
time
without
covering
joint
concerted
action
on
the
part
of
the
employers.
now,
the
board,
originally,
on
this
issue
in
the
morand
case
held
that
it
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
the
employers
to
suspend
operations
in
anticipation
of
such
a
strike.
three
circuit
courts
of
appeal
that
dealt
with
that
issue
disagreed
with
the
board
and
held
that
such
in
a
lockout
is
a
call
or
suspension
of
operations
was
not
an
unfair
labor
practice.
the
board
reconsidered
this
whole
problem
in
this
case
and
has
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
a
suspension
of
operations
by
these
employers
who
are
members
of
a
multi-employer
bargaining
association
is
a
lawful
and
permissible
defensive
weapon
as
against
these
--
these
selective
--
the
selective
whipsawing
type
of
strikes
which
as
i've
said
is
calculated
to
exploit
the
union
in
order
to
bring
about
the
capitulation
of
the
entire
group.
now,
i
hardly
need
that,
i
think
after
little
words
that
the
answer
to
this
very
chronic
question
has
been
--
is
a
difficult
one,
it
certainly
has
been
a
difficult
one
for
the
board.but
nevertheless,
as
the
board
now
sees
the
issue,
we
think
that
the
resolution
of
this
question
cause
for
an
accommodation
of
the
employers'
interest
in
preserving
their
bargaining
position,
in
preserving
the
integrity
of
the
--
of
their
multi-employer
bargaining
relationship
and
interest
which
i
--
so
later
show,
we
think,
that
the
statute
recognizes
as
one
entitled
to
protection
and,
as
they
say,
in
accommodation
between
that
interest
and
on
the
other
hand
the
employees
right
to
strike
which,
of
course,
the
statute
also
protects.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
yes,
sir?
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
your
honor,
in
the
morand
case,
the
board
dealt
with
this
problem
at
some
length.we
have
cited
that
in
our
brief.
we've
also
cited
the
court's
decision
--
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
the
morand
case.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
we
have
first
set
forth
the
various
cases
--
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
yes,
we've
set
those
forth
in
our
brief.
we
have
also
--
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
i
would
recommend
two
articles,
your
honor.
one
is
by
professor
koretz
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
and
recently
there
was
a
--
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
the
syracuse
university.
that's
right.
it's
cited
in
our
brief,
both
articles.
he
wrote
two
articles,
the
lockout
and
then
the
lockout
revisited.
and
the
second
one
which
i
think
is
very
valuable,
your
honor,
and
i've
only
come
across
it
just
recently.
it's
the
chicago
--
the
latest
edition
of
the
chicago
law
review.
there
is
an
article
by
professor
--
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
meltzer,
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
professor
meltzer
and
i
think
you
--
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
it
just
come
out,
that's
right.
i
read
it
only
last
week.
