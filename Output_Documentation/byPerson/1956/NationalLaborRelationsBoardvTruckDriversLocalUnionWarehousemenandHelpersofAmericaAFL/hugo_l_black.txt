justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question
in
that
connection,
i'm
going
to
infer
for
myself?
is
there
anything
in
the
statute,
any
provision
in
the
statute,
any
words
in
the
statute
which
you
could
point
which
indicate
that
a
collective
group
of
employers
acting
as
a
unit,
as
you
say,
makes
the
contrary
have
anymore
or
less
right
to
exercise
that
economic
power
than
a
single
employer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
get
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
purpose
of
that
is
that
in
that
sector
unit
taking
integrity,
using
language
i
can
understand
a
little
better
from
my
standpoint.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
you're
saying
that
when
they
make
this
kind
of
an
agreement,
collective
agreement,
they
have
a
right
to
use
the
economic
power
of
the
unit
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
insofar
as
they
do
not
violate
some
terms
of
the
unfair
labor
--
of
the
board,
some
--
some
provisions
of
the
board.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why?
or,
the
purpose
is
isn't
it
not,
as
i
gather,
they
insist
they
have
a
right,
1
or
10,
which
ever
is
a
legal
unit
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
shutdown
their
plant
if
they
want
to
when
they
are
bargaining
with
unions
and
say
now,
we
are
going
to
shutdown
our
plant,
you
take
that
into
consideration
in
what
terms
we
do
it.
that
being
the
case,
i'm
unable
to
see,
unless
you
have
something
in
the
statute
which
distinguishes
between
the
right
to
shutdown.
when
you
have
a
one
employer
and
have
groups
that
you
have
something
in
the
statute,
i
feel
like
justice
harlan
is,
see
where
you
can
draw
much
distinction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
heard
what
you
said
to
him
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
from
my
standpoint.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
anything
in
there
that
says
that
they
can
or
cannot
shutdown
their
plant
whenever
they
desire
or
is
there
any
language
in
the
act
which
indicates
they
can
shutdown
their
plant
in
connection
with
their
bargaining
in
order
to
make
the
other
side
to
have
a
better
turn?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
whether
the
board
does
or
not,
are
there
any
provisions
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
the
other
side
could
or
would
rely
on
which
indicates
that
in
this
bargaining
process,
it's
recognized
that
an
old
technique
used
by
employers
before
there
was
a
board
to
wit,
we'll
shutdown
our
plant
if
you
don't
agree
with
us.
is
there
anything
it
indicates
that
any
of
that
power
was
left
or
is
there
anything
that
indicates
that
power
was
taken
away
from
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
does
it
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why?
didn't
it
say
that
to
forbid
lockouts
if
lockouts
are
forbidden?
i
mean
why
is
it
necessary
to
forbid
them
under
certain
circumstances
and
therefore
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
taken
any
position
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
the
board's
case
or
its
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
the
board's
case
or
its
argument
rest
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
now
that
being
true
stopping
there,
why
--
if
that
be
the
case,
would
it
give
them
any
more
or
any
less
power
than
they
would
have
if
they
were
a
single
unit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand
all
this
whipsaw
business.
it
seems
to
me
like
you
have
a
problem
here
where
the
statute
forbids
lockouts
as
a
--
and
you
--
to
use
lockouts
as
a
means
of
improving
your
bargaining
advantage
with
the
adversary,
adversary
here
being
the
union.
and
i
cannot
see
why
--
maybe
--
maybe
i
just
can't
get
it.
i
cannot
see
why,
if
the
statute
permits
lockouts,
thus,
when
a
single
employer
earned
his
bargaining
with
his
labor
union
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
or
prohibits
it
either,
it
does
one
or
the
other.
i
can't
see
why
unless
you
can
point
to
something
in
the
statute
which
indicates
the
mere
fact
that
instead
of
having
one
due
to
bargaining,
you
have
three
would
change
the
problems.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
say
--
what
did
they
say
their
purpose
was?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
it
make
any
difference
if
they
had
stated
what
i
--
the
hypothetical
case
i
suggested?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
understand
that
it
would
be
lawful
or
unlawful
for
the
union
to
strike
against
all
the
multiple
employers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
be
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
board
take
a
different
position
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
understand
the
board's
position
to
be
that
it
would
be
all
or
nothing,
they
would
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
be
the
--
to
strike
against
all
the
multiple
employers
or
they
can't
strike
against
any?
justice
hugo
l.
black
am
i
correct
--
am
i
correct
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
best
bargain
they
could.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you
challenged
--
you
say
that
first
premise
upon
which
the
court
below
acted,
you
said
the
first
premise,
i
don't
--
maybe
the
others
don't
really,
namely,
that
an
individual
employer
has
no
right
to
close
the
shop
within
bargaining
with
its
agents
and
so-called
non-organizational
controversy.
i
assume
you
would
agree
that
--
sad
to
say
that
if
this
was
done
to
prevent
organizations
and
its
men,
that
was
an
unfair
labor
practice.
but
as
i
understand
it,
it's
been
cited
here
that
that's
--
was
not
the
purpose.
suppose
you
--
suppose
that
premise
on
which
judge
frank
told
is
wrong
as
--
and
entered
in
some
degree.
both
of
the
employer
does
have
a
right
to
close
his
shop.
what
would
you
say
about
the
case
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
there
had
been
a
legal
right
or
--
which
one
did
you
strike
against
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
let's
suppose
of
legal
right,
the
frontier
strike
or
frontier
to
close
his
store.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
for
the
premise.
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
to
--
what
--
what
did
they
do
to
just
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
just
laid
off
the
truckers,
they
didn't
close
the
business?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
--
that
--
would
that
be
a
shutdown
or
would
that
be
a
--
something
else?
would
that
be
a
close
out?
would
that
be
what
the
statute
talks
about?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'll
tell
you
why
i'm
interested.
i'm
interested
with
this
reading.
the
question
has
been
raised,
maybe
it's
not
here
and
maybe
you
can
tell
me.
the
question
has
been
raised
that
a
single
employer
had
a
right
to
do
this,
a
contracting
event,
and
some
history
of
the
original
wagner
act
to
decide
it
and
the
taft-hartley
in
reference
to
the
employers'
right
even
after
the
act
was
passed.
now,
assuming
that
those
acts
do
leave
an
employer,
a
single
employer,
free
to
bargain
by
saying
out
or
do
what
they
can,
assuming
that
it
does,
what
would
you
say
would
happen
to
your
case
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
though
there
was
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
both
sides
had
agreed
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
one
would
--
i'm
not
saying
anybody
would.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
one
would
agree,
you
have
(inaudible)
in
that,
there
are
two
others
--
that
right
is
the
same
of
the
employer,
whatever
it
is,
whether
it's
an
individual
or
contract
or
multi
--
multi-party
contract
within
the
(inaudible),
then
would
you
not
be
compelled
to
reach
that
next
question
that's
argued
that
if
it
were
a
single
employer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
--
have
you
answered
the
argument
i've
just
presented,
is
it
irrelevant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
referring
--
referring
to
the
original
wagner
act
history
and
the
language
that
does
on
the
second
circuit
indicate
that
shot
outs
or
whatever
you
call
it,
lockouts
are
permitted
and
that
means
that
other
lockouts
are
permitted.
have
you
--
