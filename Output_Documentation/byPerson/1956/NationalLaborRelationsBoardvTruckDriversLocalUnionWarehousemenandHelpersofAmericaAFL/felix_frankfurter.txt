justice

we
had
--
closing
up
in
the
second
--
mr.
manoli,
in
your
brief
--
i'm
just
asking
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
the
other
equal
protection
and
criminal
--
do
you
set
forth
the
whole
history
of
this
problem
or
is
there
any
place
that
this
must
have
a
considerable
history
to
strike,
does
it
not?is
that
set
forth
in
your
brief
and
is
there
any
--
i
gather
from
my
own
reading
of
the
past,
they're
--
they're
not
of
the
few
that
living
the
literature
of
a
right
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
now,
would
you
mind
indicating
that
one
doesn't
--
want
to
get
the
whole
carload,
whether
the
two
or
three
--
there's
discussion
of
the
--
being
apart
from
--
as
--
as
the
board
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
name
of
that
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
give
the
history
before
the
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
take
that
your
brief
will
give
the
history
before
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
a
number
of
decisions
as
i
recall.
justice
felix
frankfurter
outside
of
that
thing
academically
or
inform
them
that
you
--
what
is
there
that
you
would
recommend
one
to
read?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
this
is
the
latest
number?
it
--
it
just
come
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
board
make
an
examination
of
the
situation
in
the
relationship
of
the
party's
attitude,
their
pronouncements,
et
cetera,
and
concluded
the
fact
that
there
was
not
a
withdrawal
or
did
it
--
how
did
it
deal
to
that
problem
as
a
whole?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
there
had
been
a
termination
of
the
multi-party
relationship,
we'd
have
a
different
case
in
your
point
of
view?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
regard
that
as
vital,
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
well,
i
--
how
did
the
court
--
how
did
the
board
deal
with
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
probably
to
think
that
there
would
be
appeal
implicitly
with
the
vital
problem
in
a
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
to
criticize
that.
i
just
want
to
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
took
it
for
granted
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
cannot?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
if
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
is
agreed
between
the
party's
resistance.
there
was
no
withdrawal
here
or
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know.
was
there
agreement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
asking
about
stipulation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
from
that,
you
say
as
a
matter
of
law,
i
can
draw
the
inference
that
the
collective
bargaining
was
existing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
withdraw
during
the
life
of
the
arrangement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i'm
assuming
of
contract.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
manoli,
you
have
said
several
times
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
certain
questions
from
the
bench
we
needn't
reach
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
stating
what
you
concede
to
be
the
circumscribed
issue
or
issues
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
a
contract
which
--
with
--
how
long?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
what
--
all
right,
finish
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
matter
of
history?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
by
the
history,
i'm
entitled
to
infer,
am
i
that
there's
no
antiunion
aspect
in
the
relationship
between
employer
and
employee?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
this
is
action
is
not
interpretable
as
an
antiunion
manifestation
or
a
refusal
to
enter
the
collective
arrangement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
essential,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not.
but
what
is
exactly
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
why
do
you
say
that
it
isn't
an
essential
part
of
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
namely,
that
the
--
that
the
board
found
that
this
is
a
defensive
tactic
or
strategy,
call
it
what
you
will
by
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
employer,
isn't
that
essential
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i
--
and
my
question
was,
isn't
it
essential
that
that
be
present,
that
negative
situations
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
that
there'd
be
no
antiunion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that
--
hold
on,
all
right,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
the
finding
here
is
of
a
collect
--
of
multiple
parties
on
one
side
is
against
the
union
with
an
honest
--
an
honest
purpose
to
renew
--
renew
terms
--
to
maintain
or
to
enter
into
negotiations
for
the
renewal
of
terms
and
with
an
honest
desire
to
appeal
such
successful
outcome
in
the
negotiation,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
everyone
of
the
statute
is
essential
to
your
case,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
anything
--
is
there
anything
to
the
statute
that
precludes
a
union
from
having
had
a
practice
over
the
years
of
dealing
with
number
of
employers
as
a
union?
what
is
there
in
the
statute
that
requires
determination
of
the
appropriateness
of
the
union
by
the
board
or
by
--
after
the
government?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
parties
may
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
parties
may
be.
if
there's
anything
in
the
law
that
precludes
peaceful
relationship
between
an
international
or
(inaudible)
and
the
body
of
employers
dealt
with
as
a
group.
is
there
anything
in
the
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
certainly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
board
is
in
law,
doesn't
it,
must
apply
its
standards?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
wonder
is
whether
the
parties
can't
go
on
without
having
any
intervention
of
government
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
most
controversial
aspects
of
industrial
relation
is
whether
there
should
be
collectivized
action
by
employers,
whether
they
should
act
collectively
or
on
their
own
individually.
is
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
makes
a
lot
of
difference
in
the
world,
whether
13
employers
make
13
individual
arrangements
for
the
union
or
whether
they
want
to
act
to
--
as
a
body
of
a
collectivity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there's
been
found
these
differences
in
the
industrial
world.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
stands
stay
in
form
from
labors
point
of
view
that
they
do
not
have
competitive
employers
that
may
undercut
the
terms
that
they
had
with
one
employer
rather
than
another.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
--
is
an
unfair
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
do
we
use
about
that?
i
don't
see
how
that
can
be.
all
right,
go
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
questions,
there
were
two
different
issues.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
gave
only
one,
namely.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
in
the
statute
recognized
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
didn't
tell
the
12
employers
they're
going
to
strike.
i
don't
see
why
an
important
fact
if
the
union
chooses
not
to
strike
or
threaten
to
strike
12
did
the
same
thing
as
when
they
do
threaten
the
12.
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
manoli,
do
i
infer
that
you
--
that
in
my
view,
assume
that
they
threat
to
strike,
meaning
of
fear
by
the
associated
employers
that
if
they
win
against
him,
they
admit
(voice
overlap).
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
infer
from
that
statement
that
the
same
thing
as
giving
a
strike
notice
to
12
employers?t
he
word
threat,
it
means
to
me,
be
thrown
around
there
very
loosely.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
operate
that
way
in
the
actual
industrial
situation.
the
mere
fact
that
he
fears
that
he
will
strike
isn't
the
same
thing
in
giving
notice
that
they
will
strike.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
their
collecting
together,
they're
associated
in
this
enterprise
resides
in
order
to
be
treated
as
a
unit,
isn't
that
the
purpose
of
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
different
thing
for
giving
individual
people
individual
notice
when
they're
not
associated
together.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
isn't
important
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
follow
that
something
that
isn't
--
everything
that
isn't
an
unfair
labor
practice
is
practice
that
--
that
conduct
prohibited
to
the
employer
anymore
than
the
other
way
around,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
the
national
labor
relations
act
doesn't
exhaust
all
the
implications
of
the
industrial
situation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
that
you
must
find
within
the
cover
of
that
statute,
everything
isn't
implicitly
prohibited,
everything
isn't
implicitly
permitted.
is
that
a
fair
statement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
multiple
arrangements?
justice
felix
frankfurter
economy
of
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
only
thing
that
leaders
likes
--
and
they
have
and
wanting
to
have
multiple
bargaining
arrangements,
is
that
it?
just
--
it's
just
time
convenience?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
that
they're
not
so
strong
that
there
is
--
that
it
doesn't
matter
to
them
to
get
uniform
agreements
among
the
competing
employer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
they
can't
do
it,
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
well,
then
again,
what's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
(voice
overlap)
to
all
unfair
labor
practices?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
of
course,
it
could.
coercion
of
course
is
not
at
all
along
the
line,
so
that's
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
unless
you
join,
that's
bad.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
if
he
persuades
them,
that's
all
right,
isn't
it?
and
you
say
the
only
justification
in
our
economy
is
that
if
they
try,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
leave
out
an
account
wholly
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
view
of
your
answer
that
if
the
union
can
get
six
or
eight
or
10
employers
with
varying
attitudes
towards
labor
standard
and
with
varying
judgment,
varying
vision
to
get
together
that
it
isn't
an
advantage
to
them
to
have
people
who
are
more
farsighted
to
try
to
find
and
bring
all
the
employers
under
a
common
arrangement.
you
leave
that
out
of
account
all
together,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
when
they
put
together
and
they
talked
and
the
judge
will
retire
to
their
own
rule
with
how
it
happened?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
there
is
something
more
than
merely
being
at
the
time,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
adversely
and
therefore
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
the
question
is
union
leadership
and
union
judgment,
whether
or
not
these
arrangements
are
or
not
for
the
benefit
of
means,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
so
it
isn't
merely
time
to
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
suggest
to
you
that
legal
rights
aren't
not
the
only
thing
that
determines
the
conduct
of
either
employer
or
employees,
the
business
judgment
and
their
relationship
is
created
and
persuasion
is
created,
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
all
of
which
play
a
very
important
part
in
this
negotiating
price.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understood
the
board
to
agree
that
if
they
--
or
at
least
--
at
least
whether
or
not
the
union
certainly
no
longer
and
we
don't
care
for
a
renewal
of
the
collective
agreement
as
multiple
arrangements,
i
understand
that
raises
a
different
situation,
determination
of
the
multiple
arrangement
is
a
very
different
story
when
there
is
a
determination
with
a
desire
to
continue
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
begs
the
question
whether
he
loses,
i
figure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
if
he
--
if
you
say
he
had
the
right,
then
--
then,
there's
no
problem.
but
i
don't
see
how
you
can
talk
there's
no
problem
if
the
union
chooses
to
argue
with
--
to
make
arrangements
with
12
united
into
an
association
rather
than
to
make
arrangements
from
the
individual.
that
seems
to
me
an
industrial
fact
which
is
a
very
different
thing
with
--
with
making
an
arrangement
and
getting
into
one
employer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understood
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
the
argument
that
i
got
was
the
fact
that
the
statute
recognized
against
the
board's
power
to
certify
a
unit
and
therefore
legalizes,
underlying
that,
is
the
legalization
of
an
agreement
with
a
collective
party
of
employer
to
show
that
it
isn't
against
the
policy
of
the
act
to
have
such
a
body
of
arrangements.
that's
a
very
different
argument
in
saying
that
because
they
have
the
power
to
designate
a
union,
a
unit,
therefore,
this
is
fair.
i
don't
think
that
therefore
is
a
problem
at
all.
but
i
do
think
that,
therefore,
it
does
follow
that
the
statute
doesn't
mean
it's
illegal
to
make
collective
arrangement
with
an
associated
group
of
employer.
that
argument
i
can
follow.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
if
you
--
if
you
recognize
that
it
doesn't
require
the
permission
to
perform,
you
have
a
collective
agreement
with
associated
employer,
then
there
is
a
fact
that
they
are
associated
employers
which
creates
a
different
situation
as
an
industrial
fact
than
when
you
have
a
single
employer.
and
that
may
lead
to
inferences
of
a
very
different
order
which
do
not
come
into
play
at
all
when
you
only
have
one
employer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
know
what
tolerated
means
in
the
law.
does
it
mean
something
that
is
--
that
is
--
that
may
be
voluntarily
entered
into
by
employers
and
unions
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that's
what
it
means?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then,
the
fact
that
that
is
not
against
the
law
may
create
a
situation,
an
industrial
situation
from
which,
unless
there's
a
limitation
in
the
act,
certain
consequences
may
be
drawn.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
did
they
get
out
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
wanted
to
keep
in
and
strike
against
each
individual
(voice

--
justice
felix

(inaudible)
as
you
referred
to
this
court
afternoon.

(b)
(1)
(b)
is
printed
somewhere
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
tell
me
first
what
it
is
or
you
tell
me
what
it
means?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
are
you
--
where
are
you
reading
from?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
that's
what
i'm
asking
for.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
act
require
the
use
of
bargain
as
--
for
12
employers,
of
an
eight?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
the
union
can't
say,
i
don't
like
mr.
smith,
i'd
go
to
mr.
jones.
would
that
--
was
that
your
distinction
in
saying,
they
must
bargain
for
a
--
to
be
confederated
into
one
body?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
true.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
the
fact
without
the
words
that
the
--
as
a
fact,
did
the
union
say,
"we
no
longer
want
to
have
one
arrangement
with
these
employers.
we
want
to
have
eight
separate
arrangements
with
eight
separate
employers."
did
they
or
did
they
continue
to
want
to
operate
with
eight
employers
subjugated
in
this
collective
bargaining?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
it
so
difficult
to
cut
through
the
fact
of
--
of
this
process
in
order
to
find
out
whether
they
wanted
to
have
an
agreement
with
an
exchange,
speaking
for
eight
employers
or
an
agreement
with
eight
separate
individualized
employers.
is
it
more
difficult
to
cut
through
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
philosophical.
that's
a
very
practical
thing
whether
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
whom
were
they
bargaining
for
what?
really
you
mustn't
read
this
in
this
kind
of
a
vague
statement.
the
point
of
which
is
somewhat
rather
the
union
was
right.
i
don't
think
that
gets
a
very
far
analysis
of
the
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
in
the
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
make
any
difference
who
the
bargaining
agency
was?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
they
were
bargaining
with
eight
or
more,
that's
immaterial
and
whichever
turns
out
will
then
say
that's
what
we
wanted
to
do,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
impute
anything.
i'm
trying
to
find
out
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
the
actual
business
facts
were
and
i
don't
like
to
be
left
in
the
part
of
thinking,
maybe
for
the
collective
body
of
eight
united
for
the
purpose
of
bargaining
or
maybe
it
wasn't.
we
were
not
going
to
be
clear
about
it.
we
simply
want
to
say
whatever
we
did
was
right.
that
seems
to
be
an
odd
analysis.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
to
me,
is
an
important
for
discovery
to
find
out,
to
ascertain
in
order
to
answer
this
problem,
of
course,
if
the
answer
is
obvious,
then
there's
no
problem
because
if
the
problem
doesn't
evaporate,
the
courts
below
decided
this
one.
if
in
order
to
understand
the
problem,
it
seems
to
me
relevant
to
find
out
whether
the
bargaining
was
with
eight
employers
federated
together
for
the
purpose
of
a
collective
unit,
then
i
have
to
find
out
what
the
fact
is.
and
i
gather
you
having
thus
far
to
say
it
doesn't
matter,
we
are
right
anyhow.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can't
find
out
what
they
are
merely
by
reading
the
wagner
act
or
the
taft-hartley
act
because
this
court
in
dealing
with
a
number
of
situations
makes
clear
that
that
kind
of
(inaudible)
is
the
words
where
reading
a
statute
sit
down
strikes,
consistent
stoppages,
et
cetera.
this
court
said
is
not
what
is
meant
in
--
in
taking
out
of
the
little
language
of
the
statute,
so
that
it
was
within
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can't
read
a
complicated
statute
like
this
dealing
with
complexes
of
industrial
relation
to
just
say
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
say
you're
allowed
to
strike,
even
to
strike
you
and
me.
that's
not
the
way
to
read
such
a
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
we
could
sit
down.
so
we'll
just
sit
down
and
invite
all
these
other
persistent
interruptive
stoppages.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
there,
they
come
from
the
point
of
economics,
from
the
point
of
the
great
communism,
nobody
who
knows
anything
about
it
would
assume
to
have
any
other
purpose
except
to
grant
their
position
in
which
one
might
have
the
greatest
sympathy
in
the
world.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
brings
us
to
this
question,
whether
the
fact
that
there
is
such
a
collective
relationship
here,
whether
that
does
not
necessarily
bring
into
play
with
that
court
(inaudible)
single
employee.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
yourself
have
said
we're
not
in
the
20's
anymore.
the
idea
of
reading
this
statute
and
--
and
conduct
under
it
as
though
nothing
has
happened
in
the
industrial
world,
as
though
unionism
has
to
attain
a
place
and
exercise
the
function
that
it
does
is
to
act
and
to
deal
with
that
statute
instead
of
what
the
greatest
reality
in
the
world.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
decide
because
congress
hasn't
spoken
with
that
fact
even
--
with
which
you
seek.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
doesn't
finish
the
problem.
i
can't
bear
the
weaker
and
therefore,
everything
they
do,
they
not
bring
about
protected
activities
for
employers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
we're
here.
