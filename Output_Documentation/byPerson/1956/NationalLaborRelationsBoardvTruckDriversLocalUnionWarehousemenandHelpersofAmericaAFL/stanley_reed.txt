was
it
a
--
a
certified
union?
justice
stanley

certified
by
anyone
of
the
employers?
had
it
been
certified
at
the
bargaining
agent
for
anyone
of
the
employers?
justice
stanley
reed
is
there
any
difference
between
recognition
and
certification?
justice
stanley
reed
only
when
there
is
a
conflict,
only
when
there's
a
struggle
over
or
whether
there's
some
--
justice
stanley
reed
yes,
but
they
may
not
be
necessary
to
have
an
election
then
--
justice
stanley
reed
the
word
recognition
refers
to
what
the
employer
does.
justice
stanley
reed
the
word
certification
refers
to
what
the
board
does.
justice
stanley
reed
is
that
right?
justice
stanley
reed
what
--
what
if
--
if
you
had
had
no
organization
but
what
would
be
the
linen
supply
of
people?
and
--
and
yet,
they
had
been
12
individual
contracts
with
linen
supply
people
and
then
in
negotiation,
one
of
them
was
struck.
could
the
other
individual
employer
supply
employer
lockout
its
employees
without
violating
the
labor
law?
justice
stanley
reed
oh,
but
if
it's
found
--
suppose
it
has
found
--
it's
never
been
presented
to
it.
just
as
it
--
as
i
understand,
it's
never
been
presented
here
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
the
informality
of
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
the
arrangement
that
--
that
was
made
to
tell
when
--
when
one
has
violated
an
agreement
that
they
never
made.
justice
stanley
reed
well,
i
must
have
misunderstood
because
i
thought
you
said
there
was
no
formal
arrangement
that
you
didn't
know
whether
the
individuals
signed
it
or
whether
the
group
signed
it.
justice
stanley
reed
if
there
had
been
a
certification
of
this
association
as
the
bargaining
unit,
would
that
change
the
situation
in
your
point
of
view?
then
--
then,
if
you
struck
one,
would
you
--
would
they
have
the
right
to
lockout
this?
justice
stanley
reed
if
there's
has
been
--
if
there'd
been
certification
here,
one
employer
could
have
decided
to
withdraw?
justice
stanley
reed
he
could've
have
locked
--
he
could
have
locked
out,
could
he?
justice
stanley
reed
certified?
justice
stanley
reed
i
have
a
difficulty
in
seeing
how
he
could
if
it's
a
certified
bargaining
union?
