justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
--
do
i
reckon
and
infer
from
what
you've
said
that
you
say
the
same
thing
that
there
had
been
an
indictment
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
other
question,
you're
not
--
you're
not
drawing
any
argument
from
what
was
or
wasn't
allowed
in
under
count
one
that's
bearing
upon
count
two.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
there'd
been
only
count
two,
i
ask
you
again.
on
what
basis
would
you
have
asked
for
a
bill
of
particulars
for
the
disclosure
of
the
identity
of
john
doe?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
does
the
allegation
that
the
charge
laid
in
count
one
spill
over
into
two
as
an
allegation
of
a
participant
in
count
two?
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
assume
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
consonance
to
the
law
and
you
would
have
no
basis
and
you're
not
arguing
the
--
i
understood
you
rest
from
our
evidence
question
that
the
evidence
that
was
introduced
under
count
one,
somehow
that
it's
been
affected
or
affected
the
jury's
verdict
on
count
two
and
therefore,
the
jury's
verdict
on
count
two
satisfies
the
sections
and
can't
be
cut
out
as
relating
exclusively
to
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
has
not
--
unless
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
of
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
upon
use
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
the
case
which
--
i
understand
that
but
you
need
to
control
count
from
--
it
raised
in
the
jury,
because
i
understand
i
think
from
what
jury
said.
that
the
government,
the
court
of
appeals
doesn't
mean
worry
about
and
he's
trying
errors
as
to
count
one,
because
especially
that
the
--
then
be
charged
to,
and
doesn't
go
beyond
--
accept
this
under
the
findings
that
he
was
guilty
on
count
two.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
walsh,
may
i
ask
you
this?
suppose,
the
only
charge
made
were
a
count
two,
it's
a
single
count
to
the
whole
indictment.
suppose,
the
government
by
way
of
coup
cuts
the
proofs
down
to
--
to
lead
establishment
of
the
count
by
having
appropriate
witnesses
say
that
officers,
that
they
arrested
him
and
there's
a
lawful
warrant
or
that
they
actually
saw
what
they
assumed
to
be
narcotics
and
he
did
buy
some
of
that.
and
they
arrested
him
and
they
then
took
the
so-called
contraband,
have
it
tested.
it
proved
to
be
a
narcotic
and
the
government
arrested
him.
and
(inaudible)
before?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
suppose
you,
and
get
up
and
say,
your
honor,
we
can
pass
this
verdict
of
acquittal
and
the
courts
deny
that
motion
and
you
say
the
(inaudible)
now,
would
that
--
suppose
that
was
a
crime
with
all
duress,
would
that
sustain
a
conviction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
hold
the
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
doesn't
extend
to
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
he
(inaudible)
as
i
understand
that,
if
i
understand
the
decisions,
the
nature
of
the
commodity
is
such
that
it
isn't
asking
too
much.
there
it
is
to
that
people
don't
have
a
package
of
narcotics
or
a
vial
or
whatever
it
is,
as
a
fact,
in
their
pocket,
normally
speaking.
and
that
the
law
may
throw
to
--
throw
or
cast
the
responsibility
on
the
defendant
to
give
some
explanation.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
presumption
of
innocence
because
the
legislature,
the
congress
can
go
very
far
in
--
in
post
driving
with
penal
consequences
i
don't
know
what's
the
end
of
the
statute,
but
it
used
to
be
five
years.
so,
if
you've
given
as
much
as
five
years
for
having
in
his
possession,
if
you
please
insofar
as
any
evidence
goes,
innocent
and
there's
talk
about
(inaudible)
about
this
is
in
the
nature
or
whatever
you
call
it,
public
or
nevertheless,
for
five
years
without
any
usual
mens
rea
to
be
established
for
remedy.
the
mere
fact
there
is
proof
of
having
on
the
person
this
outlawed
thing
for
about
five
years.
and
that's
settled.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
goes
on
and
holds
the
presumption.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
what
--
what
do
you
do
with
presumption?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
presumption
is
it
goes
through
fact
that,
in
chicago
you
don't
grow
poppies,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
the
--
the
baggageman,
would
say,
mr.
walsh,
you
just
might
be
getting
this
bag.
and
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
94?
i
mean
--
all
right
now.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
walsh,
may
i
go
back
a
minute
to
the
problem
of
presumption.
what
--
what
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
walsh,
may
i
ask
you
to
go
back
to
the
--
i'm
sorry
(inaudible)
to
the
presumptions
about
the
--
i
don't
find
the
charge
or
should
i
--
if
i
overlooked
it
in
the
record.
it
was
the
court's
charge,
that's
not
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
is
before
that.
so,
--
that
plays
an
interesting
question.
how
did
the
court
charge
itself
with
the
oddity,
the
english
phrase
when
--
when
they
sit
without
a
jury
(inaudible)
misdirected
itself.
was
there
any
direction
by
itself
as
to
how
you
will
determine
this
question
of
presumption?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
this
in
one
day?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
how
--
how
many
hours
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
waived
the
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
drawing
any
inferences
that
are
allowable
to
be
drawn,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
were
bound,
but
you
don't
have
to
agree.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
--
i'm
not,
i
mean,
mr.
walsh,
i'm
not
suggesting
(inaudible)
all
i
am
saying
you
left
it
to
the
judge
to
draw
such
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
knapp,
may
i
ask
you
whether
the
sentence,
the
fine
part
of
the
sentence,
it
seems
to
--
what
is
that
--
what
do
you
do
with
that,
is
that
a
$5
to
run
concurrently?
i
know
money
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
don't
imply
that
even
though
it
runs.
justice
felix
frankfurter
meaning
by
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
$5.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
that's
the
way
i
would
read
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
must
say
it's
sort
of
special
english,
we
have
$5
to
run
concurrently.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
it
means
$5.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
that
there's
two
years
for
each,
for
the
(inaudible)
although.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
$5
also
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
must
be
told
that
he
is
in
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
can
take
it
out
of
some
cross-examination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
knapp,
i'm
much
interested
in
the
problem
raised
by
--
i'm
much
interested,
the
problem
raised
by
this
case
in
your
reference
to
the
old
hardy
case
on
a
regular
opinion,
109
massachusetts.
now,
this
rule
--
this
rule
about
informants,
that
isn't
--
is
that
--
i
know
its
functions
under
policy
and
the
government
--
the
opportunity
of
--
of
having
commission
of
crimes
revealed
to
the
government
et
cetera,
et
cetera
shouldn't
be
dried
up,
but
isn't
--
isn't
the
ruling
section
5,
i
wonder
what
it's
all
about,
has
to
do
with
the
relevance.
if
a
defendant
wants
to
find
out
who
it
was
who
snitched
on
him,
what's
that
got
to
do
with
the
issues
in
the
case?
he
may
then
find
out
the
fellow
who
told
the
government
is
a
(inaudible)
and
not
to
be
trusted,
that
has
nothing
to
do
that
doesn't
bear
on
within
the
framework
of
relevance
in
the
chronic
in
the
(inaudible)
crime
had
nothing
to
do
with
whether
he
did
or
didn't
deal
for
money
from
a
postal
savings
bank
et
cetera,
et
cetera
or
as
here.
but
when
the
issue
--
when
--
when
some
evidence
through
a
person
has
come
to
the
government
which
does
bear
on
and
is
relevant
as
to
the
defense
that
a
man
might
make
against
a
charge,
then
certainly
the
federal
cases,
those
three
cases
that
they
rely
on
and
differentiate,
they
--
of
course
you
can't
be
shut
off
including
your
remedy,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
have
the
way
to
deal
with
this
problem
not
from
any
hard
and
fast
rule
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
within
nice
calculations
whether
a
fellow
is
an
informer
or
isn't
an
informer
because
that
isn't
an
exclusive
statement
in
this
world
and
there
might
be
an
undercover
man,
not
an
informant
in
the
sense
that
he
runs
around
or
gives
tips,
but
that
he
does
that
and
also
works
to
watch
crime,
the
commission
of
them
by
--
by
being
undercover.
i
think
we
get
a
little
--
i
think
we
get
more
lively
to
discuss
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
point
of
view
of
the
relevant
to
what
was
thought
to
be
elicited
here
to
the
issues
of
the
case
as
the
defenses
he
has
a
right
to
make.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
knapp,
i
don't
quite
understand
unless
--
i
speak
polite.
i
appreciate
why
you
--
of
a
question
what
now
you're
answering,
but
i
don't
see
how
you
can
answer
these
questions
in
abstractly
as
you
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
fact
that
he
is
an
informer
doesn't
preclude
all
securing
of
evidence
and
the
fact
he
isn't
doesn't
require
that
it
be
given.
i
don't
understand
how
you
can
discuss
this
question
of
evidence
in
abstractly?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this,
on
this
point.
in
--
i
mean
a
fellow
comes
in
to
the
u.s.attorney's
office
and
makes
a
complaint
and
then
the
assistance
at
the
complaint
desk
decides
whether
or
not
this
case
should
be
presented
to
the
grand
jury,
tell
him
--
telling
you'll
find
it
interviewer
he
defendants.
i'd
like
to
know
who
the
assistant
u.s.attorney
was
and
thought
there
was
a
case,
could
he?
well,
he's
an
informer
or
whatever
he
is,
he
couldn't,
i
could
suppose
because
it
isn't
relevant
to
the
defense,
if
it
is
then
i
don't
care
whether
you
label
him
an
informer
or
don't.
but
if
we
go
around
making
distinction
as
to
who
is
and
who
isn't
an
informer,
we'll
keep
out
stuff
that
ought
to
be
let
in
and
to
let
in
stuff
that
ought
to
be
kept
out
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
statutes.
i'm
--
i'm
just
wondering
if
that
isn't
the
problem
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
why
do
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
an
informer
or
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's--
that's
in
the
case.
i'm
not
talking
about
the
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
of
answering
a
question
even
from
the
bench.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
said
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
question
if
he's
an
informer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
"i'm
going
to
object
to
that
question."
the
court
objection
sustained
then
there's
a
long
colloquy
for
two
pages
which
ends
up
again
with
the
court
sustaining
the
government's
objection.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
excuse
for
withholding
his
name
or
producing
it
isn't
any
good
if
the
disclosure
is
appropriate
for
helpful
thought
of
the
defendant,
would
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
would
as
a
general
principle
because
the
government
always
has
the
alternative
of
deciding
that
they
will
keep
the
informer
intact
rather
than
convict
john
smith,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
all
these
considerations
merely
means
if
the
evidence
isn't
important
or
relevant
to,
if
it
isn't
fair
to
enable
a
man
to
make
a
proper
defense
to
disclose
the
informer's
name,
there's
a
considerations
policy
that
you
shouldn't
gratuitously
waste
that
asset
if
the
government
conceded,
isn't
that
what
the
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
you
have
to
get
down
to
the
particular
case,
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
knapp
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
well,
i
--
i
get
into
trouble
maybe
to
--
first
time
you
told
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it's
an
issue
or
not
and
then
evidence
was
given
that
makes
it
an
issue.
believe
me
you
don't
put
an
--
a
witness
on
a
stand
if
--
if
his
testimony
is
not
in
issue,
is
that
the
whole
theory
of
anglo-american
trial.
but
what's
an
issue
of
--
of
credibility
raised
is
the
issue
of
witnesses.
one
who
is
important
says
yes
and
the
other
who
says
no
then
he's
entitled
to
bring
the
witness
who
says
no.
i
mean
i
feel
that
--
oversimplify
this
thing,
i
don't
see
--
i
think
i
do
but
i
see
you're
saying
the
crucial
question
is
whether
this
is
relevant
to
the
issues
in
the
case.
and
if
it
is,
the
fact
that
he's
an
informer
is
immaterial
but
that's
--
it's
cumulative
which
may
be
a
consideration
not
having
a
fourth
witness
if
you
have
three,
but
if
it
isn't
rejected
on
that
ground
which
is
a
matter
of
discretion
for
the
trial
court
and
if
he's
the
only
other
fellow
to
a
relevant
issue,
then
he
must
be
produced,
informer
or
no
informer.
now,
on
which
(inaudible)
to
stand
that
it
is
not
an
issue,
all
--
that
although
an
issue
and
it
--
it
is
not
irrelevant,
it's
cumulative
and
therefore
the
trial
court
has
discretion
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
that
if
it
an
issue
it
must
be
produced.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
plenty
of
those
seems
to
last
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
can't
cut
off
a
source
of
evidence
which
is
for
practical
purposes
is
essential
to
a
defendant,
can
he?
that's
not
a
matter
of
discretion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
taking
any
position
with
this.
i'm
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
--
how
i
should
determine
what
the
issue
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
one
thing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
one
thing
i'm
sure
about,
the
only
thing
i'm
sure
about
is
that
the
trial
court
cannot
say
that
it
is
more
important
to
protect
a
source
of
information
for
the
government
than
to
do
justice
to
the
defendant,
he
can't
make
that
decision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
to
the
defense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
cant
say
on
the
whole
in
balancing
these
two
things,
it's
more
important
that
--
that
an
informer
or
more
important
that
somebody
who
contributes
in
running
down
crime
shall
be
put
--
that
his
identity
should
be
protected
and
in
the
particular
case
a
little
bit
of
hardship
could
be
done
to
the
defendant.
he
can't
do
that,
can
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
he?
can
you
answer
that
question?
can
the
judge
say,
"well,
this
will
be
a
little
bit
hard
on
the
defendant
and
make
his
--
and
make
it
more
difficult
for
him
to
establish
his
innocence,
to
rebut
the
case
again.
we'll
make
it
more
difficult
to
have
a
jury
or
a
judge
within
no
jury
finding
--
not
finding
not
--
not
guilty
because
i
am
throwing
this
protection
of
source
of
that
information
to
an
overwriting
interest
of
society."
he
can't
do
that,
can
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
can't
do
that
arbitrarily
--
he
can't
do
that
arbitrarily,
can
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
record
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
contradicts
that
that's
the
situation
then
he
can't
cover
it
up
by
saying
it's
a
discretion
and
your
job
is,
if
i
may
say
so,
your
job
is
to
convince
this
court
that
whatever
--
whatever
advantage
might
have
accrued
whether
in
trial
strategy
or
what
as
the
defendant
is
so
minimum,
its
so
unimportant,
its
such
a
--
what
you
say
a
trial
tactic
but
as
against
that
the
projection
of
a
secret
source
of
information
is
important.
that's
your
job
as
i
recall.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
knapp,
there's
one
point
that
i
would
like
to
have
you
state
the
government's
position,
you
may
have
and
(inaudible)
namely,
the
ground
that
the
court
of
appeals
took
that
it
heard
with
all
these
question
of
informer
and
so
on
because
of
the
sentence,
the
stay
in
count
2
and
then
under
count
2,
the
problem
doesn't
arise.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
--
what
is
your
position
on
that?
