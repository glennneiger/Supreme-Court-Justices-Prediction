mr.
walsh.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
continue,
mr.
walsh.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
testimony
to
that
effect
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they
haven't
told
him
to
make
that
statement
that
he
didn't
know
the
defendant
or
any
--
any
testimony
of
that
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
knapp.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
a
man
finds
himself
confronted
with
three
or
four
police
officers
testifying
against
him
and
he's
--
he
has
the
option
either
of
pinning
his
testimony
against
all
of
theirs
or
remaining
mute
at
the
trial,
might
he
not
be
a
lot
more
likely
to
remain
mute
if
he
couldn't
get
the
witness
who
had
participated
there
and
whom
he
thought
might
help
him
than
if
he
could?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
here,
in
this
case,
do
you
--
do
you
contend
that
the
--
the
defendant
ought
to
make
his
defense
or
at
least
initiated,
blindfolded
then
--
and
then
give
the
government
the
right
to
determine
whether
--
whether
or
not
at
some
particular
phase
in
the
trial
they
can
let
him
in
on
information
that
he's
entitled
to
from
the
outset,
do
you
maintain
that
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
he
didn't
have
his
witnesses,
he
would
blindfolded,
wouldn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he
knows
one
thing
that
the
witness
said
once
in
the
presence
of
officers
that
he
never
saw
this
man
in
his
life
before.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
man
--
that's
the
man
who
was
present
there
when
--
when
john
doe
said
that
he
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i
didn't
know
you
could
then
ring
a
bell
that
your
own
witness
had
rung.
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
could
best
--
who
could
best
enlighten
the
court
or
the
jury
on
that
subject?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
knapp,
what
--
what
case
do
you
rely
on
as
being
most
nearly
on
its
facts
like
this
case
so
far
as
this
informer
rule
that
you
speak
of
is
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
said
there
are
a
whole
line
of
them,
just
give
me
the
one
which
you
rely
on
most,
that's
closest
to
this
so
we
can
say
well,
this
lies
in
the
same
field
as
this
and
--
and
the
informant
participated
to
some
extent
and
--
and
so
forth,
it
must
have
that
in
mind.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
305,
291?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
were
the
facts
in
that
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
feel
on
its
facts
this
--
that's
even
close
to
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
shed
us
a
light
to
get
a
little
more
into
this
field
before
he
gets
to
--
gets
to
that.
i
would
like
to
ask
you
this,
mr.
knapp.
suppose
this
man
was
a
police
officer,
john
doe
and
none
of
us
know
here
but
what
he
was
a
police
officer.
suppose
he
was
a
police
officer,
one
of
four
or
five
that
participated
in
this
affair
and
the
government
took
the
position,
"well,
we
just
don't
want
to
tell
you
which
police
officer
it
is,
we
don't
want
to
divulge
who
that
is."
would
they
have
a
right
to
do
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
let's
say
then
that
he
wasn't
a
regular
police
officer
but
that
he
was
a
regular
employee
of
the
government
who
was
around
making
buys
in
the
narcotic
world,
would
you
say
then
that
they
have
a
right
to
keep
all
those
people
undercover?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
legal
distinction
between
them?
they're
both
agents
of
--
of
the
government,
aren't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
difference
in
their
function
if
they
both
do
this
--
this
particular
thing
that
we're
talking
about?
what
would
be
the
difference
whether
john
doe
was
a
paid
informer
or
was
an
agent
assigned
to
undercover
work
of
that
character
and
he
did
exactly
what
john
doe
did
in
his
case,
what
is
the
difference
in
law
so
far
as
the
relationship
of
that
person
to
a
trial
is
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
i
--
and
i
thought
so.
but
now
is
john
doe
--
was
john
doe
a
paid
informer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
he
would
be
in
that
position
we've
just
been
talking
about?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
if
there
is
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
then
if
there
was
no
--
there
is
no
distinction
in
your
mind
between
him
and
the
police
officers
doing
that
same
duty,
why
then
couldn't
the
--
the
government
anytime
it
wanted
just
--
just
refuse
to
disclose
one
of
its
officers
who
participated
in
--
in
a
case
against
the
defendant
and
--
and
who
--
who
was
a
part
of
the
scheme
that
they're
trying
the
man
on.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
weren't
abstractions
--
they
weren't
abstractions,
they
were
specific
questions
about
specific
things
and
--
and
specific
situations
that
we
ask
about
very
often
from
this
bench.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
is
asked
--
he
has
been
asked
about
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
who
--
who
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
would
be
available
other
than
--
other
than
john
doe
to
give
evidence
on
the
subject
as
to
whether
he
had
ever
seen
this
defendant
before
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
he
and
john
doe.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
the
petitioner
be
entitled
to
--
to
have
that
kind
of
evidence
in
court
to
support
him
even
if
he
did
chose
--
choose
to
take
the
stand
himself?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
isn't
that
contradictory
evidence
at
least?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
the
thought
on
that
part
be
sufficient
to
--
to
justify
the
judge
in
denying
a
witness
to
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
defendant.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
proof
in
--
in
the
record
here,
is
there
any
proof
that
you
can
point
to,
to
the
effect
that
he
did?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
knapp,
how
about
on
the
question
of
conflict,
how
about
--
how
about
on
the
question
of
this
report
that
mr.
walsh
was
talking
about
at
page
131
where
officer
durham
said
that
this
was
--
this
was
found
by
james
l
--
officer
james
l.bryson
in
the
court
--
i
mean
in
the
car
and
then
on
another
occasion
mr.
durham
testified
that
he
himself
had
found
it.
now,
do
you
not
think
that
the
one
man
who
is
driving
that
car
and
--
and
to
whom
supposedly
this
was
delivered,
mr.
john
doe
might
--
might
be
helpful
to
the
defendant
in
--
in
determining
which
of
those
officers
was
the
one
who
actually
found
it
in
his
car
along
side
of
him.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
his
written
statement
was
to
the
contrary.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he
put
his
initials
on
that
--
on
that
report,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
think
that's
(voice
overlap)
of
a
conflict
anyway
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
defense
might
be
entitled
to
--
to
the
only
witness
who
would
know
whether
it
was
bryson
or
durham?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
--
you
don't
because
you're
on
the
other
side,
but
may
be
the
defense
would
and
--
and
really
you're
not
--
you're
not
entitled
to
determine
for
the
defense
whether
it's
important
to
him
or
not,
that's
--
that's
his
right
with
all
the
process
that
the
court
leaves
open
to
him
and
the
opportunity
to
get
witnesses
to
substantiate
his
position.
and
for
you
to
say
well,
that
conflict
does
amount
to
anything
to
me
and
the
other
--
the
other
one
about
john
doe
not
knowing
him
was
unimportant
because
it's
cumulative,
i
don't
think
the
government
has
the
right
to
decide
those
things
in
determining
whether
it
will
divulge
the
name
of
a
participant
in
a
thing
of
this
kind.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
in
this
--
if
officer
durham
testified
that
he
--
he
got
it
out
of
the
car
and
officer
bryson
testified
that
he
got
it
out
and
the
record
showed
--
written
record
signed
by
or
initialed
by
officer
durham
showed
that
bryson
got
it
out.
certainly,
you've
got
a
conflict
that
the
only
man
--
other
man
who
was
there
and
knew
what
happened
should
be
on
the
job,
that
if
he's
wanted,
isn't
that
correct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
saw
who?
chief
justice
earl
warren
surely.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
walsh,
i
don't
--
i
don't
quarrel
with
you
about
whether
it's
reasonable
to
suppose
this
or
suppose
that.
the
only
--
the
only
thing
that
is
in
my
mind
is
this,
that
if
there
is
one
of
the
participants
in
this
sale
and
possession
of
narcotics
that
has
been
put
in
there
by
the
government
and
the
government
officers,
all
except
that
participant,
have
testified.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
that's
the
only
--
that's
the
question
that
bothers
me,
not
whether
your
officers
are
truthful
or
not,
i'm
--
i
don't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
don't
question
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
knapp,
on
the
question
of
cumulative
evidence,
can
--
can
the
government
produce
all
the
witnesses
that
it
wants,
all
the
witnesses
it
has
except
one
who
might
not
be
favorable
to
them
for
one
reason
or
another
and
then
decline
to
produce
that
one
or
to
give
his
name
so
that
the
defense
can
use
him
on
the
grounds
that
his
testimony
would
only
be
cumulative
of
what
they
have
already
put
into
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
who
is
ever
going
to
know
that
--
who
is
ever
going
to
know
that
if
the
defense
doesn't
have
an
opportunity
to
see
the
witness
and
talk
to
him
or
at
least
have
the
opportunity
to
--
to
know
who
he
is
and
subpoena
him?
is
the
government
going
to
decide
that
question
in
camera?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
according
--
according
to
the
--
according
to
the
prosecution
testimony
but
he's
not
bound
by
that.
he's
entitled
to
have
any
witness
that
will
contradict
that
and
it
might
be
that
john
doe
would
contradict
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
only
thing
here
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
the
only
--
the
only
thing
he
has
said
in
the
case
has
been
something
that
--
that
if
repeated
on
the
witness
stand
would
greatly
help
the
defendant.
he
said
i
never
saw
him
in
my
life
before.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
it
had
been
approved,
but
he
did
say
it
--
he
did
say
it,
didn't
he?
it's
in
the
record.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
at
first,
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
walsh,
i've
--
we've
taken
so
much
of
your
time,
principally
me.
if
you
want
a
few
minutes
to
sum
up
your
argument
in
order
to
--
to
make
any
additional
point,
we
didn't
give
you
an
opportunity
to
make,
you
may
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
may
take
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you,
mr.
knapp.
