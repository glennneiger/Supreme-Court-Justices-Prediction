and
did
the
man
in
the
trunk
overhear
anything
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
meant
did
he
have
--
describe
any
conversation
connected
with
that
particular
event,
the
supposed
placing
of
the
envelope
in
the
car?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me,
mr.
walsh,
did
you
suggest
what
time
it
ever
was
that
the
evidence
says
what
has
happened?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
the
incident
itself
in
the
transfers
inside
the
(inaudible)
matter
of
minutes
and
seconds?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
the
record
saying
affirmatively
how
many
seconds?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
--
and
that
would
not
that
be
so
in
the
interval
--
from
the
time
he
walked
to
the
spot
five
or
six
feet
away
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
back
with
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
actual
fact,
that
that
--
whatever
the
time
was,
that's
what
i
had
in
mind
asking
you
earlier,
the
time
that
elapsed
when
they
brought
the
package
over
to
the
car
where
john
doe
sat,
possession
wasn't
there
(inaudible)
in
fact
alone.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
you're
--
that
you
suggest,
anyway,
that
the
government's
still
supporting
count
one
and
all
the
only
evidence
as
to
the
activity
of
john
doe,
that
was
in
the
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
never
delimits
these
one
or
two.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
see
that
that
originally
when
that
statement
of
john
doe
that
in
the
evidence
was
restricted?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
hearsay
i
suppose,
wouldn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
hearsay
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
put
your
finger
on
that
in
the
evidence
in
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
your
first
in
that
in
the
record.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
see
that
you
were
in
this
lawsuit
on
the
pages
that
--
pages
you
referred
us
to.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
pages
are
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we're
happy
that
at
least
this
record
doesn't
show
that
the
government
made
any
objection
to
the
cross
examination
of
that
issue.
is
that
the
first
occasion
when
you
were
elicited
that
there
had
been
that
conversation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
did
not
recognize
him?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
answer
mr.
justice
clark,
whether
you
might
have
seen
at
john
doe
as
a
witness?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
were
you
adjudged
guilty
on
both
counts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
weren't
any
conclusion,
were
there,
for
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
none
were
requested?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
they
can
expose
to
have
been
contemporaneous
with
the
events?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
recording
really
the
details
as
you
understood
it
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
the
judge
denied
that
application.
did
he
state
a
ground?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
not
material?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
one
last
question,
mr.
walsh.
i
noticed
at
page
103,
you
make
a
statement
speaking
of
john
doe,
“we
believe
he
is
dead,
unless
we
know
who
he
is,
we
cannot
say
that.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
fellow
holmes
is
dead?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

$10
fine
then.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
only
one
$5
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
consider,
mr.
knapp,
that
john
doe
was
merely
an
informer
in
the
sense
that
i
as
the
observer
may
see
a
crime
committed
and
report
that
back
to
the
police?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
type
of
informant
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
merely
an
informer
at
all,
no
matter
how
you
define
this
one.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
not
an
informer,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
quite
understand
why
the
government
suggests
that
the
rules
governing
the
right
of
--
to
keep
secret
the
names
of
informers
in
the
sense
i
define
informer
would
apply
to
an
individual
like
this.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
but
that's
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
my
point
though,
are
they
really
merely
informers?
he
--
he
was
more
than
that,
whether
you
say
he
was
an
actual
participant
in
a
crime
or
not,
he
certainly
took
a
very
--
played
a
very
large
role
in
all
of
the
events,
didn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
doesn't
--
he
doesn't
merely
inform,
he
actually
plays
such
a
role
as
that
the
other
witnesses
are
able
then
to
testify
to
things
which
the
plea
by
the
fact
finder
mean
that
the
accused
is
guilty.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
does
that
--
he's
just
not
informing
on
the
fact
that
a
crime
has
been
committed
or
that
may
--
a
crime
perhaps
will
be
committed
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
he's
actually
setting
up,
he
is
part
of
the
circumstances
which
establish
that
a
crime
has
been.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
you
have
to
take
that
position
in
light
of
the
reliance
on
the
english
and
other
cases
that
informers
--
the
names
of
informers
may
be
kept
as
this
one
was
from
the
defense
upon
request.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
could
agree
with
you
as
to
the
kind
of
informer
who
merely
reports
to
uncle
sam
or
the
state
government
that
something
is
happening.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
as
to
an
individual
who
plays
this
much
of
a
role,
i
have
more
questions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
there
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
those
individuals,
independent
of
the
presence
of
the
so-called
informer,
would
go
right
on
committing
the
illegal
activities.
here,
you
have
the
crime
itself
established
by
reason
of
the
participation
of
this
individual
with
the
accused.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
of
course,
but
to
whom
did
he
make
it?
to
john
doe,
didn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
so-called
informer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
a
little
different
from
the
ring
situations
that
you
discuss.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
he
did
but
the
trial
court
denied
the
applications
to
have
john
doe
identified
long
before
it
was
gone
whether
or
not
the
defendant
was
going
to
take
the
stand.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
bill
of
particulars
and
as
i
read
the
record,
later
in
the
record
when
questions
were
asked
by
the
--
mr.
walsh,
by
a
witness
who
said
he
knew
who
john
doe
was,
objections
of
the
government
were
sustained.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
at
the
103,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
at
the
103,
was
--
i
think
the
question
was
asked,
“officer,
do
you
know
john
doe
by
any
other
name?”
“yes,
sir.”
“what
is
that
name?”
mr.
emanuelson,
he
was
the
united
states
attorney,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
--
what
i'm
getting
to,
mr.
knapp,
does
the
question
whether
the
government
fairly
withheld
the
identity
of
john
doe
turn
in
this
case
and
whether
or
not
the
defendant
took
the
stand
or
should
have
taken
the
stand?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
would
suppose
that
but
i
--
i
understood
you
just
argued
that
we
had
to
look
at
this
case
and
its
fact
setting
and
that
an
important
fact
was
that
the
defendant
did
not
take
the
stand.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
let
me
phrase
it.
does
it
--
does
the
question
here
turn
on
whether
or
not
he
did
or
did
not
adduce
any
evidence
in
support
of
his
defense
either
by
taking
the
stand
or
otherwise?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
could
he
know
if
he
didn't
know
who
john
doe
was?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
as
the
burden
of
mr.
walsh's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
as
the
burden
mr.
walsh's
argument
that
he
doesn't
know,
he
knows
that
somebody
according
to
the
evidence
of
the
other
government
witnesses
at
the
police
station
identified
to
the
defendant
as
john
doe
denied
that
he
never
seen
john
doe
or
seen
the
defendant
before.
that's
as
much
as
he
knows
but
who
that
was
as
to
--
that's
the
burden
of
mr.
walsh's
argument.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
can't
tell.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
according
to
mr.
walsh
they
thought
it
was
this
chap
holmes,
holmes
is
dead
now
and
was
of
course
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
if
that's
the
fact
that
he
was
dead
and
he
couldn't
appear,
why
was
the
government
so
anxious
not
to
disclose
who
he
was?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
knapp,
getting
back
to
some
basic
fundamentals.
i
suppose
the
injunction
or
the
kind
of
domestics,
to
the
prosecutor's
job
is
to
do
justice
and
not
merely
to
secure
convictions,
ought
to
have
some
bearing,
should
apply
in
a
case
where
the
government's
own
witnesses
say
that
john
doe
in
their
presence
denied
he'd
ever
seen
the
defendant.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
is
logical
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
what
troubles
me
is
how,
under
those
circumstances,
the
government
can
justify
not
supplying
the
defendant
with
a
name
which
perhaps
might
have
enabled
the
defendant
to
--
to
establish
a
defense
which
for
all
i
know
might
be
complete.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
recognize
that
the
fact
that
the
government's
own
witnesses
were
willing
to
say
on
the
stand
as
they
did
that
that
was
the
case,
presented
a
situation
where
you
--
the
government
should
have
revealed
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
only
thing
is,
mr.
--
the
thing
that
bothers
me
is
that
there
would
never
have
been
a
case
for
the
prosecution
of
this
petitioner,
except
at
least
it
would
not
have
been
this
case
for
the
prosecution
of
this
petitioner
except
for
john
doe's
partner.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
isn't
that
--
doesn't
that
put
it
in
a
category
very
different
from
any
of
the
situations
in
which
perhaps
very
legitimate,
the
government
may
insist
that
it
should
not
be
required
to
divulge
the
--
the
identities
of
people
who
helped.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
apart
whether
there's
an
issue
--
apart
whether
there's
an
issue
or
not,
i
don't
understand
why
the
government
can
keep
to
itself
information
of
that
kind
when
the
individual
concerned
is
the
only
reason
there
was
any
opportunity
to
prosecute
petitioner
at
all.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
may
have
witnesses
but
this
--
this
transaction,
this
event,
this
incident
would
never
have
occurred
except
for
john
doe's
partner.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
very
likely,
absolutely,
isn't
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
that
it's
(voice
overlap)
mr.
knapp.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
he
has
to
point
--
all
he
has
to
point
to
i
suggest
is
that
your
witnesses
said
that
john
doe
said
at
the
police
station
he'd
never
seen
the
petitioner
in
his
life.
