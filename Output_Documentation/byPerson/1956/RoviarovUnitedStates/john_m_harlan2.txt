justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
make
the
point
that
you
were
entitled
to
a
bill
of
particulars
independently
of
your
demand
for
as
a
disclosure
of
this
informant's
name?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
mean
as
to
the
informer
or
the
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
to
the
informer.
justice
john
m.
harlan
getting
back
to
the
informer
did
you
ask
for
the
identity
of
the
informer,
otherwise
and
through
your
bill
of
particulars?
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
just
on
that
point,
did
the
government
object
to
be
introduced
in
the
--
reduction
of
that
evidence
or
the
eliciting
of
that
cross-examination?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
what
are
the
--
what's
the
ground
of
their
objection
the
first
time?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
assume
it'd
be
hearsay?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
was
wondering
about,
was
how
they
could
object
to
the
eliciting
of
that
information
that
they
did
on
the
grounds
of
hearsay
and
then
refused
at
the
same
time
to
produce
or
decline?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
but
the
testimony
that
i'm
referring
to
may
be
i
--
i
understand
wrongly.
i
thought
you
said
that
on
cross-examination
of
one
of
the
witnesses,
a
statement
of
john
doe's
testified
to,
in
which
he
was
alleged
to
have
said
he
didn't
recognize
your
men.
now,
that
i
suppose,
is
objectionable
as
a
matter
of
hearsay.
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
would
like
to
ask
you
a
question
about
the
court
of
appeals
raising
it.
supposing
you
look
at
this
case
just
as
a
count
2
case,
might
not
the
identity
of
this
man,
whom
the
record
shows
was
used
as
the
man
to
set
up
the
case
as
it's
called
might
not
his
testimony
had
a
bearing
on
the
possible
defense
of
entrapment?
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
didn't
put
on
a
defense?
justice
john
m.
harlan
certainly
would.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
if
they
had
this
man's
testimony
they
might
have
been
presented
with
that
defense.
