mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
review
of
a
conviction
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois
at
chicago,
which
was
affirmed
by
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
indictment
in
the
case
was
in
two
counts
charging
two
events
from
a
transaction,
an
alleged
transaction
or
event
occurring
on
the
evening
of
august
12,
1954.
count
one
charged
the
petitioner
did
on
august
12,
1954,
at
chicago,
illinois,
sell
to
john
doe
for
an
unknown
consideration,
a
quantity
of
narcotics
without
an
order
from
john
doe
on
the
form
prescribed
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
in
violation
of
section
2554(a)
of
title
26,
u.s.c.a.
count
two
charged
that
the
petitioner
on
august
12,
the
same
night,
1954
at
chicago,
illinois,
did
then
and
there,
fraudulently
and
knowingly
received
concealed,
fraudulently
and
knowingly
received
concealed,
buy
and
facilitate
the
transportation
and
concealment
after
importation
of
a
quantity
of
narcotic
drug
knowing
the
same
to
be
imported
in
violation
of
section
174,
title
21,
united
state
code.
now,
after
the
plea
of
not
guilty,
the
defendant
filed
a
bill
--
filed
for
a
bill
of
particulars
in
which
he
asked
for
disclosure
of
the
name
of
the
identity
of
john
doe.
he
asked
for
the
exact
date
which
was
alleged
under
the
(inaudible)
he
asked
for
the
day
--
for
the
time
of
the
day
and
the
place
by
street
and
number
in
the
city
of
chicago,
where
the
offense
or
offenses
occurred.
in
the
bill
of
particulars,
the
request
was
denied
in
all
respects.
the
trial
was
before
a
district
judge,
without
a
jury.
jury
was
waived
by
all
concerned.
the
government
introduced
oral
evidence
of
four
witnesses
and
that
took
up
a
single
day.
the
four
witnesses
were
two
government
agents
and
two
chicago
city
policemen.
and
then
there
were
the
physical
exhibits
which
are
usually
introduced
in
such
cases.
and
it
was
stipulated
by
the
parties
that
if
the
government
chemist
was
called,
he
would
testify
that
these
physical
exhibits
that
were
offered
when
analyzed
as
narcotic
drugs.
at
the
close
of
the
government's
case,
the
defendant
moved
for
acquittal
and
his
motion
was
overruled.
the
defendant
offered
no
evidence.
now,
the
evidence,
well
at
first,
i'll
describe
the
questions
as
we
contend
they
are.
and
i
think
that
they
can
best
be
summarized
in
this
fashion.
that
john
doe
in
this
case
was
not
a
mere
informer
whose
identity
the
government
could
keep
to
itself.
john
doe
was
a
participant,
active
participant
in
those
entire
transactions
which
was
described
by
the
evidence.
and
under
those
circumstances,
the
defendant
was
entitled
to
know
his
identity.
i
think
that
he
was
entitled
to
know
his
identity
on
his
request
for
the
–
under
the
bill
of
particulars.
now,
in
the
lower
--
in
the
court
of
appeals,
we
contend
that
his
conduct
permeated
all
of
the
events
that
are
involved
in
both
charges.
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
below
was
in
error
when
it
contended
that
roviaro's
possession,
which
i'll
get
to
later,
of
a
narcotic
drug,
justified
his
conviction
under
count
two
in
any
event.
and
that,
therefore,
they
would
avoid
applying
the
reasoning
of
three
cases
which
were
urged
upon
them.
those
were
the
portomene
case,
the
sorrentino
case,
and
the
united
states
versus
conforti,
all
of
which
are
described
in
the
--
in
the
briefs
and
discussed
by
both
parties.
now,
in
connection
with
that,
i
have
urged
in
this
--
in
this
brief,
this
--
this
question.
rule
7c
provides
for
an
indictment.
the
constitution,
the
fifth
amendment
provides
that
a
person
must
be
prosecuted
for
a
felony
by
indictment,
unless
he
waives,
of
course,
in
accordance
with
the
rules.
rule
7c
provides
for
an
indictment
and
if
the
indictment
conforms
to
the
rule,
that
is,
it
is
a
concise
statement
of
the
essential
requirements
--
essentials
of
the
offense,
then
that
is
an
indictment.
and
you
have
been
indicted
in
accordance
with
the
constitution
with
that
amendment.
but
i
say
that
under
the
present
rules
of
pleading
and
as
prosecutors
have
been
become
prone
to
do,
we
are
no
longer
securing
conformance
with
the
sixth
amendment
which
requires
that
the
accused
be
informed
of
the
nature
and
cause
of
his
acquisition,
another
amendment.
and
while
the
indictment
may
be
sufficient
under
rule
7c,
and
comply
with
the
requirement
of
the
fifth
amendment,
the
sixth
amendment
has
not
been
complied
with
in
a
great
many
cases
by
the
type
of
pleading
which
has
been
described
by
some
authors
as
notice
pleading.
and
then,
there's
a
refusal
in
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court
of
the
bill
of
particulars
on
the
theory
that
it
is
not
a
matter
of
right
in
the
defendant.
it
is
a
matter
of
discretion
in
the
trial
court
for
substantial
error
to
be
determined
later,
later
on.
and,
of
course,
in
the
hodgepodge
in
--
in
the
proceeding
of
trial,
the
defendant's
contention
concerning
his
requirement
that
concerning
his
need
for
information
as
he
goes
into
trial,
his
need
for
the
information
as
to
the
nature
and
cause
of
his
acquisition
that
some
degree
of
particularity
disappears
in
the
(inaudible)
of
the
trial
because
there's
an
overwhelming
set
of
facts
brought
in
against
him.
and
it's
so
easy
to
say,
no
substantial
error.
his
proof
was
--
his
guilt
was
apparent.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
yes,
i
--
i
make
the
contention
that
the
denial
of
the
bill
of
particulars
in
this
case
was
reversible
error.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
as
to
--
as
to
the
informer.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
and
that
i
--
i
believe
that
on
the
other
points
we
were
entitled
to
the
bill
of
particulars
but
i
think
that
the
substantial
error
has
been
so
embellished
by
the
occurrences
through
the
trial
regarding
the
identity
of
john
doe,
that
that
is
our
principal
point.
now,
our
second
point,
now,
the
--
every
witness
in
this
case,
who
was
offered
by
the
government,
the
four
witnesses,
was
enquired
upon
cross-examination
concerning
the
identity
of
john
doe.
some
were
even
asked
if
they
knew
whether
he
was
a
living
person.
none
denied
that
they
had
the
knowledge
but
the
objection
of
the
prosecutor
was
sustained
as
to
the
question
and
pursuit
of
that
line
of
cross-examination
was
denied
with
each
witness.
now,
the
second
point,
the
second
question
we
have
is
that
one
of
these
witnesses,
we
believe,
was
contradicted
upon
a
material
matter
by
another
government
witness
and
by
an
exhibit
that
was
introduced
into
evidence.
and
that
it
was
then
indicated
by
the
government
that
this
man
has
made
other
extra
judicial
statements
concerning
the
events
of
the
evening.
and
a
demand
was
made
upon
the
government
to
produce
those
statements
during
the
trial
and
this
situation
developed
by
examination.
and
that
the
man
was
denied.
we
consider
that
was
violative
of
the
principles
of
the
gordon
decision
by
this
court
in
344
u.s.
414.
now,
the
third
point
regards
the,
as
much
as
anything
else,
the
construction
of
statute
174,
title
21
usc.
that
statute
provides
that
whoever
fraudulently
or
knowingly
imports
or
brings
any
narcotic
drug
into
the
united
states,
contrary
to
law,
or
receives,
conceals,
buys,
sells
or
in
any
manner
facilitate
the
transportation,
concealment
or
sale
of
such
narcotics,
knowing
the
same
to
have
been
imported
contrary
to
law,
and
so
forth,
shall
be
punished.
and
then
it
has
a
paragraph,
"whenever
on
trial
for
a
violation
of
this
subdivision,
the
defendant
is
shown
to
have
or
to
have
had
possession
of
the
narcotic
drug,
such
possession
shall
be
deemed
sufficient
evidence
to
authorize
conviction
unless
the
defendant
explains
the
possession
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
jury."
now,
that
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
below
avoided
construction
of
the
portomene,
sorrentino
and
conforti
cases
to
the
facts
involved
here
by
stating
that
since
the
defendant
had
possession,
under
the
testimony
of
a
witness,
plus
inference,
therefore,
he
could
not
be
heard
to
complain
of
conviction
on
count
two,
even
though
errors
may
have
occurred
through
his
trial.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
inference
that
has
been
adopted
by
some
of
the
courts
of
appeal,
the
effect
that
any
knowledge
or
excuse
me,
any
possession,
any
possession;
is
sufficient
to
bring
this
presumption
into
play,
is
an
erroneous
one.
it
is,
simply
put
it,
it
is
this.
that
i
may
possess
this
book.
certainly,
it
is
not
presumptive
that
i
have
them.
that
i
know
everything
that's
in
it.
the
--
the
possession
of
a
sealed
package,
fleeting,
cursory
as
it
was
in
this
case,
passing,
in
this
case
and
while
it
was
--
is
--
while
it's
described
by
the
witnesses
as
having
been
in
the
possession
of
the
defendant,
it
was
in
his
possession
for
a
mere
few
seconds
and
at
that
time
they
were
unable
to
describe
its
physical
characteristics,
it's
size
or
shape.
but
in
any
event,
it
is
the
contention
of
the
government
that
that
possession
of
that
sealed
package
brought
home
to
this
defendant,
not
only
knowledge
that
it
was
imported
in
violation
of
the
law,
but
had
him
know
that
it
was
narcotics.
now,
it
is
the
presumption
that
he
knows
that
it's
narcotic,
that
i
quarrel
with.
i
say
that
it
is
not
reasonable
and
especially
where
the
proof
in
all
of
these
cases
requires
that
a
government
chemist,
a
technical
person
testify
as
to
the
chemical
content
and
to
show,
in
order
to
show
that
these
packages
do
contain
narcotics.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
no,
sir.
we
haven't
done
that.
now,
there
have
been
some
constructions
of
that
section.
the
(inaudible)
case,
and
the
government
has
relied
also
on
the
casey
which
is
not
a
construction
of
that
statue,
but
a
construction
of
2554
or
53
of
title
26,
the
purchase
and
sale
of
--
of
narcotics
though,
title
26.
but
in
that
statute
there's
also
a
presumption,
but
there
the
presumption
is
only
that
such
possession
shall
be
prima
facie
evidence
of
a
violation.
in
this
statute,
the
presumption,
justice
shall
be
deemed,
the
possession
shall
be
deemed
sufficient
evidence
to
authorize
conviction
unless
the
defendant
explains
the
possession
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
jury.
now,
i'd
like
to
describe
the
facts
in
the
case
very
briefly,
and
then
go
back
to
these
questions.
the
--
all
four
witnesses,
the
agents
and
the
two
policemen
described
the
meeting
at
a
certain
corner
in
chicago
on
august
12,
1954
with
john
doe.
they
were
in
their
automobiles
and
various
preliminaries
occurred.
that
he
was
--
there
were
two
meetings,
actually,
and
he
was
searched
each
time,
but
when
we
get
into
the
action
which
triggers
these
events,
ultimately,
we
--
we
find
that
he
was
searched
and
then
he
was
permitted
to
get
into
his
own
cadillac
automobile,
which
had
already
been
searched.
and
he
drove
to
a
certain
street
corner
and
the
agents
then
took
up
positions
close
by
in
their
automobiles,
from
which
they
could
keep
observation
of
this
cadillac.
that
one
of
the
agents
was
in
the
trunk
of
the
cadillac,
and
peculiarly
enough
he
was
the
tallest
and
heaviest
of
the
agents.
he
was
six
feet
three
and
weighed
230.
but
in
any
event
he
concealed
himself
in
the
trunk
of
the
cadillac.
they
remained
for
an
hour
and
five
minutes
at
this
corner,
awaiting
something.
at
the
end
of
the
hour,
at
11
o'clock
the
automobile
--
an
automobile,
a
pontiac
automobile
arrived.
the
defendant
got
out
from
behind
the
driver's
seat,
entered
the
passenger
seat
beside
the
driver
in
the
cadillac,
and
the
pontiac
was
driven
away
by
a
person
who
had
accompanied
the
defendant.
that
is,
i
say
the
defendant,
that's
what
the
witnesses
for
the
government
said.
and
all
three,
other
than
the
man
in
the
trunk,
identified
him
at
that
time.
the
cadillac
then
took
off
in
a
circuitous
route
according
to
these
men,
first
followed
by
one
automobile
and
closely
and
then
that
tail
was
taken
up
by
a
--
a
second
automobile
in
which
there
was
a
single
agent.
the
one
containing
two,
gave
up
the
--
the
following
after
several
blocks
and
then
the
single
agent
stayed
behind
the
car.
from
a
point
of
about,
i
think
he
called
it
exactly,
he
said
he
had
measured
it
later
on,
at
94
feet
away,
at
11
o'clock
at
night
or
somewhat
after
that,
by
the
aid
of
a
street
light
and
a
bright
moon.
he
saw
the
--
the
cadillac
stop,
and
the
door
immediately
opened,
the
defendant
leave
the
cadillac,
walk
to
a
tree
five
or
six
feet
away,
bend
over
and
pick
up
a
package,
the
physical
characteristics
of
which
he
was
unable
to
determine
at
that
time,
he
said.
walked
back
to
the
cadillac,
which
was
parked
and
leaned
in
as
though
depositing
something
on
the
seat.
the
defendant
then
waived
his
hand
as
to
say
farewell
and
walked
away,
and
was
later
seen
to
get
into
the
pontiac
and
drive
away.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
the
man
in
the
trunk
described
certain
conversation
that
--
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
yes,
he
did.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
he
heard
the
words,
"this
is
it",
which
he
--
his
identification
of
the
defendant
rests
on
the
fact
that
he
lifted
the
lid
of
the
trunk
about
three
inches
and
peaked
out
while
the
defendant
was
picking
up
the
package,
which
he
could
not
describe,
but
said
was
something.
now,
the
play
on
the
word
"package",
"the"
and
"a"
is
considerable
in
this
case,
but
in
any
event,
the
witnesses
described,
of
course,
that
he
picked
up
a
package.
now,
this
is
two
of
them.
one
is
a
man
standing
on
the
street
96
feet
away.
the
other
is
the
man
concealed
in
the
trunk
and
each
says
he
picked
up
a
package.
one,
and
one
only
durham,
says
that
he
leaned
into
the
car
as
though
depositing
something
in
the
--
on
the
seat
and
when
his
hand
came
out
it
was
empty.
the
defendant
walked
away.
immediately
after
this,
durham,
this
agent,
approached
the
cadillac,
went
to
the
right
front
seat,
to
the
passenger's
seat
and
found
an
envelope
on
the
floor
of
the
car,
beside
john
doe.
now,
bear
in
mind,
john
doe,
there
--
there
is
no
testimony
to
connect
this
man
with
--
with
any
offense
at
all
until
he
enters
the
automobile
of
john
doe.
then
he
drives
or
he
doesn't
drive.
john
doe
drives
and
there's
conversation
saying
about
--
talking
about
details
and
things
of
that
sort.
there's
a
little
controversy
over
the
admission
of
that
testimony.
the
judge
--
the
trial
judge
stated
that
unless
bryson,
the
man
in
the
trunk
could
identify
the
defendant
as
being
the
person
who
was
talking,
he
would
not
admit
it,
but
he
would
rule
on
that
later,
because
there
was
no
jury.
there,
he
--
he
did
not
--
he
would
exclude
it
later.
he
did
not
exclude
it.
i
assume
that
he
considered
it,
but
in
any
event,
there
was
some
conversation
along
that,
and
i
would
say
in
fairness
that
the
other
the
--
the
three
witnesses
having
seen
roviaro,
get
in
the
car
and
the
car
taking
off
immediately
and
having
them
followed.
that
it
was
probably
a
fair
inference
that
roviaro
was
talking,
if
we're
to
consider
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses,
which
in
the
light
that
we
must.
but
in
any
event,
this
package
is
recovered
now
by,
according
to
this
version,
by
durham,
from
the
floor
of
john
doe's
personally
owned
automobile,
the
cadillac,
in
john
doe's
presence,
while
john
doe
has
been
present
with
the
door
of
his
car
open
watching,
well,
there
isn't
testimony
to
that
effect,
but
i
assume
it
can
be
considered.
he
could
have
watched,
watching
roviaro,
walk
to
the
--
walk
to
the
tree,
pick
up
the
package,
and
come
back
and
either
that
is
the
package
that
was
found
in
the
car
or
it
wasn't.
now,
the
trial
judge
apparently
took
the
inference
that
it
was,
because
--
and
i
--
i
assume
that
we're
--
we're
faced
with
that,
as
a
matter
of
fact
at
this
point.
but
in
any
event,
there
is
display
in
the
testimony
and
he
picked
up
a
package
and
from
thereon,
there
is
conversation
by
the
witnesses,
by
the
government
counsel
throughout
the
case,
at
every
stage
of
just
the
package.
now,
that's
the
possession.
that's
the
possession
of
roviaro.
from
the
tree
to
the
seat
of
john
doe's
car.
i
submit
that
the
package
was
actually
recovered
from
john
doe's
possession.
i
submit
that
the
possession
with
that
car
open,
that
john
doe
was
driving,
roviaro,
walking
to
get
the
package,
is
it
in
any
sense
a
mutual
possession
that
they
were
acting
together.
certainly,
either
it
could
have
been
indicted
as
the
aider
and
abettor
of
the
other,
if
each
was
a
criminal.
now,
john
doe
has
been
described
here
by
the
agents
as
an
informer.
well,
of
course,
we
don't
--
we
don't
really
know
that,
other
than
their
mere
claim
--
other
than
their
mere
claim.
he
has
never
been
produced,
his
name
has
never
been
disclosed.
his
identity
has
never
been
disclosed.
now,
after
about
an
hour,
now,
the
--
bearing
in
mind
the
suspicious
attitude
of
the
agents,
naturally,
in
following
this
car,
nevertheless,
they
watched
roviaro
walk
away
and
now
this
seems
an
unnatural
situation
in
a
way
that
a
contraband
of
that
nature
would
be
deposited
in
a
vehicle
which
could
move
at
high
speed
and
that
stood
still
and
the
pedestrian
walks
away.
and
he
walks
away
within
the
observation
of
the
agents
and
no
attempt
is
made
to
apprehend
him.
about
an
hour
and
half
later,
they
went
to
his
home
in
another
part
of
chicago.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
the
--
between
the
time
that
the
transfer
occurred?
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
and
the
visit
to
his
home?
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
well,
that
was
seconds.
it
--
it
was
from
the
point
that
of
roviaro's,
emergence
from
the
cadillac.
he
is
walking
five
or
six
feet
and
bending
over
picking
up
something,
walking
back
and
making
a
motion
as
though
depositing
something
in
the
cadillac
and
then
walking
away.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
no,
it
doesn't,
but
as
it
was
described
it
--
it
--
i've
assumed
that
it
was
just
very
few.
it
was
practically
not
--
right
in
sequence.
now,
the
agents
returned
to
another
place
and
compared
this,
examined
this
powder
that
was
in
these,
in
three
envelopes
inside
the
packages
they
had
described.
they
then
went
to
roviaro's
home
and
arrested
him,
about
an
hour
and
a
half
after
this
transfer
in
the
event.
they
took
him
to
the
police
station.
on
the
way
there,
they
contended
that
they
had
some
conversations
with
him
in
which
they
scolded
him
for
engagement
in
such
a
--
a
vile
occupation
and
told
him
that
--
asked
him
how
he
would
like
to
be
put
in
a
tank
with
a
--
a
group
of
narcotic
victims
and
asked
him
who
his
boss
was
and
so
forth.
and
say
that
he
told
them
that
he
had
stood
up
before
and
he
was
--
they
were
wasting
their
time
and
that
he
would
take
it.
nothing,
indicating
more
and
to
--
to
my
conclusion
than
bickering
between
prisoners
and
policemen.
when
they
arrived
at
the
police
station
because
there
was
no
contention
by
the
government
that
he
compelled.
there
was
no
offer
to
him
of
a
document
to
sign,
which
would
be
in
my
experience,
the
usual
thing
if
they
contended
that
he
was
admitting
guilt.
these
were
the
tricks
of
conversation
as
remembered
by
witnesses
long
after
the
event.
but
in
any
event,
when
they
arrived
at
the
station,
this
occurred.
john
doe
and
the
defendant
were
brought
together.
and
john
doe,
for
some
reason
of
detection
or
something,
i
don't
know
what
it
was,
they
claim
he
was
their
informer,
is
asked,
“do
you
know
this
man?”
he
said,
“no,
i
never
saw
him
before.”
he
said
that
of
the
defendant.
that
was
developed
on
cross-examination.
at
one
point
the
trial
judge
struck
that
out
and
with
another
witness
he
permitted
it
to
stand.
so,
i
--
i
say
that
it
is
in
the
record.
now,
it
my
contention
that
--
that
that
again,
emphasized
and
exaggerated
the
error
of
nondisclosure
of
john
doe.
in
the
first
place
in
order
to
properly
prepare
for
our
trial,
we
should
have
known
him
under
the
bill
of
particulars.
he
was
alleged
there
to
be
an
active
participant.
there
was
no
other
reasonable
conclusion
to
be
drawn
from
these
two
counts,
standing
as
they
worked
them.
then
that,
this
is
a
single
event.
this
is
one
transaction,
divided
into
two
offenses
of
separate
statutes.
nothing
wrong
with
that.
that's
been
approved
by
the
courts
many
times,
but
it
was
a
single
event.
and
in
order
to
prepare
for
either,
it
was
necessary
to
know
who
john
doe
was,
if
we
were
to
make
any
effort
to
determine,
what
he
might
have
to
say
if
called
as
a
witness.
but
in
any
event
and
what
his
character
was,
what
his
background
was.
so
that
we
wouldn't
have
to
ask
the
judge
for
delay
if
he
appeared
as
a
witness.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
we
could
not
have
because
there
wouldn't
have
been
a
indication
of
a
--
of
a
fellow
participant
at
that
point.
but
--
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
well,
i
think
with
both
counts
that
as
they
usually
are,
a
defendant
would
have
a
right
--
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
--
to
assume
that
they
referred
to
the
same
event.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
well,
i
contend
this
to
your
honor.
well,
the
government
has
not
withdrawn
its
support
of
count
one.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
it
has
not.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
insofar
as
i
understand
the
case,
not
formally
--
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
--
not
formally
--
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
--
but
the
implied
--
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
that
is
correct.
but
it
is
my,
i
--
i'd
like
to
point
out
or
indicate
that
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
government
has
not
withdrawn
from
its
support
of
count
one
although,
how
it
could
be
sustained,
i
don't
understand.
but
in
any
event,
and
the
court
of
appeals
just
said
that
well,
we
won't
have
to
apply
the
portomene
cases,
the
portomene
and
sorrentino
case
--
cases
which
hold
that
where
a
--
an
informer
is
not
a
mere
informer,
that
a
participant
in
the
events
involved,
then
he
must
be
disclosed.
now,
regardless
of
whether
we
had
a
single
count
two
and
a
bill
of
particulars
error,
regardless
of
that,
the
denial
of
cross-examination
concerning
the
identity
of
this
active
witness
who
was
present
throughout
the
transaction
that's
involved
in
count
two
and
who
is
participated
in
at
--
under
our
contention,
in
other
words,
he
was
the
--
the
defendant
left
his
automobile,
was
brought
to
his
automobile
by
--
by
the
--
by
john,
was
brought
to
the
scene
by
john
doe,
left
john
doe's
automobile,
immediately
returned
and
deposited
it
--
the
package
of
narcotics
giving
the
government's
evidence,
its
--
its
strongest
and
most
intended
view,
and
left
it
with
john
doe
and
walked
away.
certainly,
i
contend
the
john
doe
was
a
participant
in
that
possession.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
well
--
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
i
--
i
believe,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
they
--
they
would
certainly
be
construed
by
most
of
the
trial
courts,
in
my
experience,
to
--
to
be
collaborators
under
such
circumstances
and
that
the
possession
would
be
mutual.
and
that
either
could
indicted
--
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
--
for
the
possession
as
an
aide
or
abettor.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
in
law,
i
believe.
i
believe
so
that
a
--
in
actual
fact
that
is
john
doe
wasn't
touching
it
and
the
defendant
was.
but
i
think
that
certainly,
we'll
all
agree
that
two
men
--
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
that's
right.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
there
was
never
any
limitation
as
to
the
--
of
the
proof
as
to
either
count.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
well,
not
under
my
point
three.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
yes,
on
the
ground
that
--
that
the
--
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
--
presumption
--
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
--
is
--
doesn't
extend
to
the
--
to
the
--
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
doesn't
extend
to
knowing
that
it
is
narcotics.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
that
isn't
what
this
statute
says,
your
--
your
honor.
this
statute
says,
"whoever
fraudulently
and
knowingly
imports
or
brings
any
narcotic
drug."
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
but
the
indictment
charged
the
same
thing.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
that
he
--
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
i
say
that
the
presumption
applies
merely
to
the
rationale
idea
that
since
these
narcotics
are
not
produced
in
the
united
states,
they
must
have
been
imported.
so
that
that
is
the
difficult
thing
for
the
government
to
prove.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
right,
your
honor.
that's
my
contention.
and
that,
i
believe,
is
all
that
was
decided
in
yee
hem
and
in
casey,
in
the
casey
cases,
which
are
--
we're
here.
now,
these
presumptions,
as
i
understand
them,
must
be
rational.
they
--
the
congress
does
have
great
power
to
--
to
set
up
presumptions.
but
consider
these
presumption.
any
baggageman
in
a
railroad
station
handed
a
suitcase
of
narcotics
must
with
the
--
if
--
without
more,
must
be
found
guilty
then,
here.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
no,
it
wouldn't,
your
honor,
because
this,
if
you'll
excuse
me
--
but
because
the
statute
says
the
possession
shall
be
deemed
sufficient
to
authorize
conviction
unless
the
defendant
explains
the
possession
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
jury.
now,
he's
been
faced
with
a
string
of
four
or
five
witnesses,
narcotic
agents
who
described
the
delivery
of
the
package
to
him,
the
fact
that
he
put
it
under
the
counter.
that
he
didn't
set
up
in
the
usual
rack.
and
so,
therefore,
maybe
his
conduct
was
surreptitious.
and
he
is
now
to
explain
to
a
--
a
standard
that
i
don't
comprehend,
the
satisfaction
of
the
jury.
that's
not
by
preponderance
or
by
reasonable
--
beyond
reasonable
doubt,
the
satisfaction
of
the
jury,
his
possession.
he's
faced
now
with
four
--
four
or
five
witnesses
who
have
described
this
situation.
maybe
he's
a
flounderer
himself.
maybe
he's
not
eloquent
in
--
in
his
delivery.
maybe
he's
a
type
of
person
who
gives
doubt
by
his
very
expression.
what
chance
does
he
have,
in
a
place
of
this
presumption?
and
--
but
--
and
this
goes
to
what's
in
your
mind.
now,
the
contention,
whoever
fraudulently
or
knowingly
imports
a
narcotic
drug,
i
--
i
believe
that
this
statute
goes
no
further
and
should
go
no
further,
than
to
support
the
inference
that
the
possessor
must
be
presumed
to
know
that
it's
imported,
because
that
is
something
that
is
very
difficult
for
the
united
states
to
prove
in
--
with
regard
to
any
specific
package.
they
--
they
prove
the
negative,
for
instance,
that
it
isn't
produced
here
or
something
of
that
sort
of.
but
the
circumstances
surrounding
your
knowledge,
like
the
knowing
violation
of
income
tax
or
the
knowing
violation
of
any
law,
would
simply
come
from
the
surrounding
circumstances
from
which
the
jury
would
a
right
to
draw
the
inference
off.
and
the
government
can
prove
those
inferences
sufficiently
or
not
prove,
and
reliance
on
that
presumption
is
--
is
not
enough.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
below,
in
sustaining
this
conviction,
relied
upon
that
entirely
in
my
--
in
my
construction
of
the
--
of
the
opinion.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
oh,
yes,
it
--
well,
not
by
any
rule
16
or
17
procedure.
on
the
bill
of
particulars
was
denied
that
we
rested
at
that
point,
but
each
witness
as
he
testified
that
he
met,
he
and
three
agents
met
with
john
doe,
on
cross-examination,
was
asked
repeatedly
the
--
in
various
ways
that
i
tried
to
device
as
how,
who,
john
doe
was,
whether
he
was
alive,
whether
he
was
dead
and
various
things
developed.
and
each
of
the
witness,
in
each
of
the
case's
cross-examination
on
that
point
was
denied.
and
i
think
that
was
an
unlawful
restriction
or
an
erroneous
restriction
of
cross-examination
on
that
point.
the
fact
that
john
doe
stated
that
he
didn't
know
us,
may
cast
an
entire
change
of
light
in
this
case,
ultimately.
from
this
point,
he
was
certainly
the
only,
absent
as
he
was,
he
was
the
only
favorable
witness
heard,
for
the
defendant.
but
his
identity
was
denied
to
us.
so,
it
would
have
been
useless
to
attempt
to
subpoena.
now,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
yes.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
i
don't
know.
the
judge
didn't
explain
the
--
the
ruling
and
--
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
sir?
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
that
was
presence
of
the
defendant
and
the
agents.
this
is
--
this
occurred
at
a
time
when
the
defendant
was
brought
to
the
police
station
and
is
confronted
by
roviaro
--
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
sir?
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
yes.
yes,
sir.
oh,
yes.
at
page
94
and
at
the
top
of
95.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
the
second
time
no,
the
first
time
yes.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
actually,
the
--
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
the
ground
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
--
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
well,
i
think
there
was
a
--
they
were
operating
on
the
theory
that
they
were
entitled
to
introduce
all
admissions.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
from
the
defendant
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
consequent
conversation
with
the
defendant
first
on
the
ride
to
the
police
station
and
then
at
the
police
station
various
conversations.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
i
don't
know
if
government
representatives
were
present
in
--
in
doing
the
questioning.
they
had
just
introduced
other
conversation
with
the
defendant
against
the
defendant.
now,
my
contention
was
that
the
entire
conversation
should
go
in,
but
i
was
limited
at
that
point.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
on
pages
94
and
95
i
was
not,
your
honor.but
under
the
cross
examination
of
the
witness
durham
--
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
well,
since
it
wasn't
admitted,
i
haven't
--
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
no,
sir.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
i
think
the
--
the
record
at
page
52
and
55.
page
52
at
the
top,
the
witness
durham,
was
asked,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
doe
said,
he
did
have
a
transaction,
didn't
he
in
roviaro's
presence.
answer
-
“do
you
want
the
entire
conversation,
isn't
what
i
asked
effect,”
“no
sir,
he
didn't
deny
it.”
“didn't
doe
say
he
didn't
even
know
him?”
“yes,
sir,
at
first
he
did.”
“and
this
man
was
the
informer
setup
by
you
for
the
transaction?”
“that
is
right.”
now
--
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
no,
sir.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
that's
right.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
the
agents
--
no
this
wasn't
a
line
up.
this
was
the
same
night
of
the
transaction
about,
within
about
two
hours.
after
the
defendant
had
been
arrested,
he
was
taken
to
the
police
station,
the
central
police
station
in
chicago.
and
the
informer
or
some
man,
the
--
the
man
that
the
agents
described
as
the
informer,
as
john
doe,
the
participant
here,
was
brought
together
with
the
defendant
and
in
the
defendant's
presence
said,
“i
don't
know
the
defendant.”
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
i
don't
know.
i
assume
he
doesn't.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
john
doe
drove
the
cadillac.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
the
defendant
as
he
stands
at
this
point,
as
--
as
i
understand,
has
--
has
plead
not
guilty
and
has
not
testified.
there
was
no
evidence
by
the
defendant
in
this
case.
and
his
position
with
regard
to
john
doe
has
been
that
he
just
doesn't
know
him.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
sir?
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
no,
sir.
we
did
not.
now,
the
--
i
--
i
think
that
the
portomene
case
makes
a
statement
in
--
in
its
discussion
concerning
that
very
situation.
that
when
this,
in
--
in
this
case,
a
defendant
is
denied
the
identity
of
one
of
the
principle
participants.
assume
that,
let
me
--
let
me
put
it
in
this
fashion.
let
--
let's
assume
that
--
that
roviaro
thought
he
did
know
who
john
doe
was.
but
then
on
rebuttal
it
turn
out
that
john
doe
was
an
entirely
different
person.
the
government
wouldn't
be
bound
by
any
impression
that
roviaro
had.
and
in
the
portomene
case,
they
point
out
that
where
the
man
is
denied
this
right
of
knowing
who
this
participant
is,
he
should
not
be
compelled
to
go
forward.
and
that
even
if
he
does
go
forward,
and
flounders
around
and
helps
convict
himself,
the
refusal
to
affording
his
right
should
prevent
the
government
from
contending
that
there
was
a
lawful
conversation.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
oh,
that
is
one
of
our
complaints.
we
couldn't
subpoena
john
doe,
because
we
didn't
know
him.
and
we
contend
that
that
was
a
--
a
denial
of
a
witness
in
our
favor.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
yes,
sir.
and
sentenced
on
both
--
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
that
he
was
sentenced
--
sentenced
on
the
indictment.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
a
sentence
on
the
indictment,
i
believe,
is
the
way
that
the
--
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
one
term.
well,
no.
he's
sentenced
to
two
years
on
each
of
counts
one
and
two
of
the
indictment
and
said
sentences
shall
run
concurrently.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
well,
that
he
was
sentenced
to
--
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
to
$5
on
each
of
counts
one
and
two
and
that
those
--
and
that
the
sentences
shall
run
concurrently
and
the
defendants
shall
stand
committed
until
the
fine
is
paid.
i
assume
that
means
$10.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
the
service
of
the
sentence
could
be
concurrent
but
i
don't
think
the
payment
of
the
fine
would
be
suspended
in
the
ordinary
language.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
so
that
in
any
event
we
--
we
stand
to
some
punishment
under
count
one
possibly.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
oh,
well,
this
was
without
a
jury,
your
honor.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
well,
the
question
was
argued
and
the
government
took
the
position
in
its
argument
or
certainly
that
couldn't
be
characterized
as
instruction
but
suggestion
to
the
judge.
he'd
argued
that
possession,
mere
possession
of
any
–-
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
no
sir.
not
insofar
as
the
court
is
concerned.
the
court
took
the
--
the
matters
under
advisement.
and
this
case
was
tried
on
a
single
day.
the
court
then
–-
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
yes.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
well,
four,
four
and-a-half
i
guess
or
five.
these
witnesses
were
--
didn't
take
as
long
as
i
left.
then
the
court
took
some
briefs
and
considered
the
matter
and
didn't
pass
on
it.
this
was
late
in
the
spring
of
1955.
didn't
pass
on
it,
until
the
fall.
and
the
--
then
again,
took
up
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
gave
it
consideration.
the
matter
of
whether
a
mere
possession
of
any
kind
or
character
is
enough
to
show
the
fraudulent
and
knowing
possession
or
fraudulent
and
knowing
character
of
the
crime
as
charged
in
the
indictment
and
as
prescribed
by
the
statute
was
argued
substantially.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
no,
sir.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
no,
sir.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
yes,
the
government
did,
the
government
and
the
defendant
and
the
court.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
i
--
i
think
we
were
bound
to
--
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
--
right
until
the
end.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
well,
but
we
certainly
will
abide.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
if
the
court
please
--
no
rebuttal
my
time
is
short.
there's
one
other
point
that
i
would
like
to
discuss
orally
and
that
is
the
refusal
to
permit
the
examination
by
the
defendant
or
to
submit
to
the
--
the
defendant
on
the
trial
certain
additional
reports
by
the
witness
durham,
agent
durham.
and
that
arose
in
this
fashion,
durham
testified
as
you
will
recall
that
he
had
recovered
this
package
which
turned
out
to
be
narcotics
from
the
seat
of
the
informer's
automobile
or
from
the
floor
of
the
informer's
automobile.
when
the
physical
evidence
was
introduced,
it
was
enclosed
in
an
envelope
which
became
exhibit
6
and
appears
at
an
inscription
which
appeared
on
that,
appears
in
the
record
at
page
131.
that
document
contradicts
mr.
durham's
testimony
and
says
that
the
matter
when
it
comes
to
the
words,
were
obtained
--
how
obtained,
found
by
officer
james
l.bryson,
that's
the
name
of
man
who
was
in
the
trunk
of
the
automobile.
where
obtained,
74th
and
st.lawrence
avenue,
chicago,
illinois
and
that
refers
to
the
material.
now,
this
was
called
to
durham's
attention
and
he
was
asked
if
that
was
not
inconsistent
with
his
testimony.
he
admitted
it
was
and
said
that
it
must
be
a
mistake
by
agent
fields
who
filled
out
the
envelope.
agent
fields
on
cross-examination
when
interrogated
about
this
matter
said
that
he
had
been
given
that
information,
the
question
was,
“who
told
you
that
this
material
enclosed
in
this
envelope
was
found
by
officer
james
bryson
at
74th
and
st.lawrence?”
“i
think
agent
durham
gave
me
the
information
at
that
time,
later
the
same
day
on
august
13th.”
and
then
he
said
that
there
was
other
information
reported
to
him
that
he
put
on
it.
now,
the
exhibit
also
bears,
according
to
the
testimony
of
both
after
it
was
filled
up,
the
initials
of
durham
and
that
was
after
these
inscriptions
as
to
how
it
was
recovered
were
on
the
envelope.
the
prosecutor
then
asked
fields
in
redirect
whether
this
was
the
official
report.
the
agent
said
no,
it
was
a
--
it
was
an
evidence
cover.
i
then
asked
if
there
were
additional
reports,
written
reports,
by
mr.
durham
concerning
this
transaction.
and
fields
said
yes.
i
asked
him
if
they
were
consistent
with
his
testimony,
he
said
he
did
not
know.
i
asked
the
government
for
production.
the
--
and
asked
the
court
to
compel
it,
the
court
--
well,
the
prosecutor
claimed
no
privilege
for
this
--
for
this
report,
for
these
additional
reports
covering
this
transaction
but
said
that
he
didn't
have
them
in
court,
he
couldn't
provide
them
until
the
next
day
at
first.
the
court
said
this
trial
will
end
tonight,
we'll
finish
it
today.
the
--
we
then
had
some
discussion
of
it,
i
urged
the
gordon,
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
gordon
case
where,
what
i
conceive
to
be,
a
very
similar
situation
arose
and
the
court
thereupon
denied
production
or
inspection
of
the
--
the
additional
reports
of
mr.
durham
covering
this
transaction.
my
thought
was
in
--
in
seeking
those
was
to
find
out
whether
his
additional
written
matters,
whether
the
other
extra-judicial
written
statements
by
him
were
consistent
with
his
testimony.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
very
close
to
it,
the
written
reports
of
agents
--
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
recording
the
details
of
the
transaction
which
might
disclose
whether
he
found
this
envelope
as
he
testified
or
whether
bryson
found
it
as
fields
said
durham
told
him
and
fields
recorded.
and
fields,
bear
in
mind,
is
a
government
agent
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
not
material.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
well,
the
--
the
discussion
is
--
is
included
in
the
record
immediately
following
page
126.
the
--
i
don't
know
that
the
government
--
that
the
judge
stated
his
ground
but
he
--
he
sustained
the
government's
objections
and
we
--
i
--
i
would
assume
that
that
was
the
situation.
i
--
i
would
like
to
--
to
say
this
much
to
the
court
that
this
charge
of
traffic
in
narcotics,
traffic
of
course
is
deplorable
but
the
very
charge
has
reached
the
point
now
where
it
tends
to
import
verity
and
therefore
it
is
an
exceedingly
dangerous
one.
the
presumptions,
justice
mcreynolds
--
mr.
justice
mcreynolds
in
a
dissent
said
in
the
--
in
the
casey
case
that
formerly
the
torture
and
they're
acquiesced,
and
it's
to
secure
a
conviction.
now,
the
presumption
has
been
brought
to
the
aid
of
the
prosecutor.
it
has
this
advantage
that
at
least
the
--
the
accused
goes
to
prison
unmutilated
and
with
--
not
to
disquieting
an
outcry.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
that's
right,
your
honor.
our
--
at
one
point
in
the
cross-examination
i
asked
if
it
was
a
specific
person,
if
it
was
a
man
named
tebbil
holmes.
when
we
--
we
thought
it
was,
but
we
have
never
been
able
to
determine
it.
the
only
thing
that
we
--
what
we
know
of
this
man
is
that
he
was
brought
--
brought
face
to
face
with
us
--
with
roviaro
in
the
police
station.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
there
is
a
man
named
holmes
who
is
dead
but
that
isn't
in
the
record
because
we
weren't
permitted
to
go
into
it
in
any
fashion.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
we
don't
know.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
well,
your
honor,
we
don't
know.
we
thought
so,
but
the
government
--
when
the
government
wouldn't
admit
who
he
was,
even
when
we
asked
if
he
was
the
informer
then
we
--
we
felt
that
we
were
powerless
to
go
forward
because
the
government's
four
witnesses
or
additional
witnesses
might
come
in
and
say
that
it
was
an
entirely
different
person.
the
government
indicates
that
this
denial
by
the
man
who
was
brought
face
to
face
with
--
with
the
defendant,
and
i
say
this
in
response
to
your
question,
was
--
that
this
denial
was
for
the
--
for
the
purpose
of
hoodwinking
the
defendant
into
thinking
that
this
person
was
involved
in
the
offense
and
was
a
fellow
prisoner.
that's
--
that's
the
argument
that
was
replied
by
their
brief
on
that
question.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
there
was
testimony
that
effect
--
to
the
effect
that
he
was
held
in
custody
but
all
of
the
officers
denied
knowing
whether
any
charges
were
ever
placed
against
him
and
they
said
that
they
haven't
in
any
event.
but
they
knew
that
he
was
held
in
custody
that
night.
mr.
maurice
j.
walsh
it
didn't
--
the
record
didn't
get
that
far,
they
started
to
say
this
was
for
the
purpose
of
and
were
cut
off.
now,
the
government
in
its
brief
here
has
urged
that
that
would
--
would
have
been
what
was
shown,
that
is
that
this
man
was
merely
concealing
his
identity
as
an
informer
at
the
time
of
that
confrontation
in
order
to
hoodwink
the
defendant
for
some
purpose
of
detection.
