mr.
james
w.
knapp
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
first
we
should
understand
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
said
with
respect
to
count
1
--
count
2.
they
held
that
as
to
count
2,
the
possession
count,
there
was
no
error
because
john
doe
had
nothing
to
do
with
petitioner's
illegal
possession
of
heroin
and
was
not
a
participant
in
any
sense
of
the
word
in
the
petitioner's
procurement
and
transportation
of
the
package.
proof
of
his
identity
would
not
have
shed
any
light
at
all
on
the
--
on
the
undisputed
illegal
act
of
the
petitioner.
it
found
that
there
were
facts
proved
showing
petitioner's
possession
of
heroin
which
furnished
prima
facie
evidence
of
guilt
under
count
2
and
left
him
with
the
burden
to
prove
he
possessed
the
narcotics
legally.
they
held
that
in
as
much
as
the
sentence
imposed
was
a
general
sentence
and
since
guilt
under
count
2
would
support
the
sentence,
it
was
immaterial
whether
error
intervened
as
to
count
1.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
it
is
my
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
government
and
the
bureau
of
prisons
would
construe
this
as
a
concurring
sentence.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
the
$5.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
that
is
--
that
is
my
understanding.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
as
--
as
i
read
the
sentence,
it
says
for
imprisonment
for
a
period
of
two
years
and
besides
that
he
forfeit
and
pays
to
the
united
states
of
america
a
fine
in
the
sum
of
$5
on
each
of
counts
1
and
2
of
the
indictment.
that
said
sentences
shall
run
concurrent.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
and
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
would
understand
it
to
be
a
$5
fine,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
a
sum
of
$5
on
each
of
counts
1
and
2
but
it
says
the
sentence
to
run
concurrent.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
yes,
the
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
your
honor,
there
was
no
suggestion
of
entrapment
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
it
would
be
a
matter
of
defense.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
any
entrapment
would
be
a
defense
issue
and
it
was
not
raised
at
any
point
and
as
i
understand
it
that
there
was
no
point
of
entrapment
at
all
in
this
case.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
but
on
the
other
hand
they
would
be
precluded,
your
honor.
they
could
still
make
the
point
of
entrapment
since
they
could
bring
evidence,
presumably
it
would
be
the
petitioner
himself.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
that's
exactly
the
point
we
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
he
would
--
he
would
be
--
it'll
be
almost
impossible
to
prove
it
without
him
unless
there
were
other
people
present,
friends
of
his
who
wanted
to
testify.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
--
i
think
your
honor's
question
gets
exactly
to
the
hear
of
the
government's
issue
--
case
here,
that
we
do
not
say
that
if
he
had
put
in
evidence
and
controverted
the
facts
here
in
some
way
that
he
would
be
--
should
then
be
still
denied
the
identity
of
doe.
i
think
that
is
a
far
different
crime
because
at
that
point,
there
would
be
an
issue
of
fact
to
be
determined
by
the
court
and
doe
would
then
of
course
be
important
to
resolve
that
issue
of
fact.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
--
that's
exactly
what
happened
in
the
portomene
case.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
i
don't
think
that
he
would
be
blindfolded,
your
honor.
if
--
if
he
made
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
yes,
but
he
doesn't
know
what
this
witness
is
going
to
testify.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
that
is
true
and
--
and
i'd
like
to
direct
your
honor's
attention
to
the
record
there.
thereafter,
the
government
on
redirect
examination
inquired
of
the
witness
and
this
is
at
the
record
on
page
53.
question
“on
june
22,
1954,
you
said
you
saw
albert
roviaro
for
the
first
time
is
that
right,
sir?”
answer
“yes,
that
is
right.”
question
“who
did
you
see
him
in
the
company
of,
roviaro?”
answer
“yes,
in
the
company
of
the
john
doe.”
question
“the
john
doe
you
have
been
referring
to
since
you
took
the
stand
this
morning?”
answer
“that
is
right.”
question
“is
that
correct?”
answer
“that's
right.”
question
“in
the
second
time
you
saw
albert
roviaro,
who
was
he
in
the
company
of?”
answer
“he
was
in
the
company
of
john
doe.
he
went
into
the
residence
that
day.”
now
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
yes,
sir,
that
is
to
redirect
examination
of
agent
durham
so
that
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
it
went
to
the
point
of
explaining
the
--
the
testimony
or
the
statement
of
doe
in
roviaro's
presence
that
he
did
not
know
him.
and
incidentally,
the
--
the
answer
to
that
question,
question
“didn't
doe
say
he
didn't
even
know
him?”
answer
“yes
--
yes,
sir,
at
first
he
did”,
which
implies
that
later
on
or
at
some
other
point
he
didn't
stick
to
that
story.
so,
i
think
it
is
a
fair
inference
that
--
that
doe
was
seeking
to
cover
up
from
roviaro
the
fact
he
--
that
he
had
been
the
informant
in
the
case
and
--
and
the
--
and
was
seeking
to
--
to
maintain
his
position
as
an
informant
because
he
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
i
would
think
here
that
--
had
the
government
proceeded,
they
might
have
elicited
that
information
from
the
agents
themselves,
but
they
did
not
go
any
further,
your
honor.
now,
the
--
the
government's
position
is
simply
this,
that
this
rule
is
the
rule
of
long
standing
that
the
courts
will
not
compel
or
allow
the
discovery
of
the
names
of
informants
or
the
channels
of
--
of
communication
of
information
flowing
to
the
government,
either
by
the
officer
to
whom
it
is
given
or
the
informant
himself
or
by
any
other
person
without
the
government's
consent.
this
rule
is
founded
on
public
policy
to
encourage
citizens
in
their
duty
to
communicate
to
the
government
information
which
they
may
have
as
to
the
commission
of
a
crime
without
fear
of
consequence.
and
it
--
it
is
a
necessary
rule
of
policy.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
obviously,
your
honor,
he
was
--
he
was
more
than
that
type
of
an
informant.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
he
--
he
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
would
characterize
him
as
an
undercover
agent.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
and
he
is
characterized
by
one
of
the
government
witnesses
as
a
special
employee.
but
it
still
doesn't
mean
that
he
is
not
an
informant
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
because
he
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
because
in
--
in
the
detection
of
(inaudible)
such
as
this,
crimes
involving
narcotics,
it
is
--
it
is
highly
essential
that
the
government
develop
informants
who
will
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
who
actually
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
they
--
these
informants
are
used
for
the
purpose
of
detecting
crime,
to
make
buys
for
the
narcotic
service
in
--
in
which
case
the
--
the
agents
conduct
a
surveillance
such
as
was
conducted
here
so
that
they
might
themselves
be
able
to
testify
to
the
events
which
transpired
without
disclosing
the
identity
of
the
person
who
was
acting
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
--
i
think
that
is
a
fair
statement,
your
honor,
but
i
still
say
that
--
that
he
is
in
a
sense
an
informant,
a
secret
channel
of
communication
through
which
the
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
yes,
sir,i
--
i
think
it's
--
it's
quite
important
in
the
administration
and
enforcement
of
the
criminal
laws
that
that
informants'
identities
not
be
disclosed,
not
only
for
the
protection
of
the
informant
but
--
but
for
the
protection
of
the
government
itself.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
i
think
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
your
--
your
honor,
the
--
the
informer
--
i
think
the
informant
can
go
a
bit
further,
as
--
as
for
instance
one
who
is
in
--
in
a
ring
or
something
and
--
and
was
reporting
back
what
--
what
is
transpiring
among
the
conspirators
and
i
believe
that
is
the
--
was
the
case
of
the
witness
in
the
--
in
the
old
english
case
of
the
trial
of
thomas
hardy,
he
had
been
just
such
a
person
and
(voice

--
mr.
james

--
disclosed.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
the
--
the
accused
here
at
least
made
the
sale
to
the
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
yes.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
yes.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
now
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
i
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
would
think,
your
honor,
that
the
scher
case
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
scher,
scher
versus
u.s.,
305
u.s.251
(voice

--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
251,
your
honor,
would
perhaps
be
as
close,
although
i
haven't
found
any
case
that's
exactly
squarely
in
point
with
this.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
as
i
understand
it
there,
there's
prosecution
in
two
counts
for
violation
of
section
201,
title
2,
liquor
taxing
act.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
of
the
liquor
taxing
act,
by
possessing
and
transporting
distilled
spirits
in
containers
wanting
the
required
revenue
stamps.
the
officers
acting
upon
information
received
from
an
informant
observed
the
actions
of
the
petitioner
and
arrested
him
and
found
non-tax
paid
liquor
in
his
car.
the
petitioner's
counsel
moved
to
suppress
the
evidence.
and
it's
held
that
in
these
circumstances
the
source
of
information
which
caused
him
to
be
observed
was
unimportant
to
the
petitioner's
defense,
the
legality
of
the
officer's
action
does
not
depend
upon
the
credibility
of
something
told
but
upon
what
they
saw
and
heard,
what
took
place
in
their
presence.
justification
was
not
sought
because
of
honest
belief
based
upon
credible
information
but
they
pointed
out
moreover
as
often
pointed
out
public
policy
forbids
disclosure
of
an
informant's
identity
unless
essential
to
--
to
the
defense
as
for
example
where
this
turns
upon
an
officer's
good
faith.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
as
i
say,
your
honor,
those
cases
are
the
closest
cases
that
we
can
get
factually
to
them
and
they
are
cases
arising
--
and
there
are
others
which
arise
from
search
and
seizure,
and
the
search
is
based
upon
information
received
from
an
informant.
now,
obviously,
the
informant's
identity
is
not
disclosed.
now,
obviously,
if
the
--
there
was
--
was
in
fact
no
such
information
received,
well
then
it
would
be
probably
an
improper
search.
but
they
do
not
let
them
controvert
it.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
that
is
exactly
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
the
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
your
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
your
honor
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
i
would
think
there
that
--
that
he
would
not
be
an
informant
in
--
in
that
sense
if
he
is
a
police
officer,
an
enforcement
officer.
and
the
--
the
witnesses
have
characterized
him
as
an
informant
and
as
a
special
employee
which
is
the
same
thing
as
i
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
i
--
i
would
say
that
that
would
be
a
difference
between
that
type
of
--
of
an
employee
and
an
enforcement
officer,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
i
wouldn't
characterize
the
special
employee
as
an
agent
of
the
government.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
perhaps
in
that
circumstance
there
might
not
be
very
little
distinction.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
as
far
as
i
know,
the
record
discloses
him
--
i
think
agent
fields
(voice

--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
think
agent
fields,
the
government
witness
and
a
federal
narcotic
agent
characterized
him
as
a
special
employee.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
he
very
likely
could
--
could
be
very
much
in
that
position.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
don't
know
whether
--
actually
whether
he
get
paid
or
not,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
think
that
--
that
there
may
well
be
a
situation
where
the
government
might
insinuate
an
agent
into
a
conspiracy
or
a
ring,
who
was
a
government
agent
hired,
has
tenure
and
emolument,
position
and
duties
in
which
case
they
might
--
might
say
that
he
was
in
the
category
of
an
informer.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
would
like
to
--
to
get
to
the
very
point
that
the
government
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
the
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
the
--
the
problem
i
think
rests
on
the
factual
situation
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
of
this
particular
case.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
the
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
that's
the
reason
--
[laughs]
mr.
james
w.
knapp
what
we
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
what
we
do
not
contend
that
--
that
in
every
instance
that
this
--
that
the
person's
identity
must
be
kept
secret
but
what
we
say
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
that
where
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
that
--
that
where
the
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
not
necessarily.
there
are
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
there
are
instances
in
which
we
--
we
agree
that
informers
name
would
be
necessarily
have
to
be
disclosed
where
it
is
the
interest
of
justice
require
it.
and
but
we
say
in
the
facts
of
this
case
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
this
man
would
produce
anything
other
than
cumulative
evidence.
just
the
same
as
if
there
are
several
people
who
observed
a
robbery
of
a
bank,
after
you
call
two
or
three,
you
don't
need
to
call
them
all.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
the
only
person
would
be
of
course,
i
presume,
the
petitioner
himself
would
state
whether
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
he
knew
him
or
did
not
know
this
john
doe.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
that's
right.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
say
that
if
he
introduced
any
evidence
at
all
tending
to
controvert
the
government's
evidence
which
he
has
left
it
all
undenied,
he
has
not
denied
any
--
any
issue
of
fact
in
here.
but
if
there
was
evident
at
any
point
raised,
an
issue
of
fact
raised
then
i'll
say
the
government
would
have
been
bound
to
have
disclosed
john
doe
because
he
then
would
be
a
person
who
might
shed
some
light
on
this
controversy.
the
agent
says
this,
the
petitioner
says
that,
there
is
an
issue
of
fact
and
at
that
point
he
has
perhaps
--
certainly
becomes
a
witness
who
--
who
can
shed
some
light
on
it.
and
in
that
point,
we
--
we
say
that
obviously
he
must
be
disclosed
but
in
the
posture
that
we
have
hereof
no
denial,
no
evidence,
uncontorverted
evidence,
as
you
might
as
well
say
admitted
evidence
of
--
of
the
government,
there
is
nothing
in
here
to
show
in
the
testimony
of
these
witnesses
other
than
the
--
than
the
testimony
that
john
doe
had
been
--
had
at
the
police
station
denied
knowing
the
petitioner.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
i
--
i
think
that
the
court
--
that
this
is
a
matter
for
the
court
to
decide
whether
or
not
he
--
he
will
require
this
disclosure
in
--
in
deciding
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
if
he
has
to
think
well,
whether
--
whether
in
fact
there
was
any
real
denial
or
whether
it
was
only
a
pretense
in
--
in
there.
i
think
that's
a
matter
for
the
trial
court
to
decide.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
you
mean
--
you're
speaking
of
the
bill
of
particulars,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
the
first
record
that
i
--
references
i
have
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
yes.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
the
--
the
point
--
the
point
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
--
i
don't
think
of
course
that
we
can
characterize
the
defendant's
failure
to
take
the
stand
any
other
way
than
the
law
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
said
that
--
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
--
that
he
did
not
adduce
any
evidence
or
any
facts
pretending
to
controvert
it.
of
course
there
are
many
instances
where
as
a
practical
matter
he
is
the
only
one
who
can
do
it.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
--
i
think
it
does
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
because
there
is
no
showing
here
that
john
doe
would
produce
anything
other
than
cumulative
evidence.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
certainly,
he
himself
knew.
he
himself
knew
whether
he
knew
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
he
knew
whether
he's
with
him
that
night.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
your
--
your
honor
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
mr.
walsh
has
assured
us
that
he
does
not
know
however
i
think
the
trial
court
might
well
have
considered
whether
in
truth
and
in
fact
that
petitioner
knew
who
doe
was
or
--
or
his
identity.
in
fact,
mr.
walsh
at
page
41
of
the
record
says,
"your
honor,
this
is
the
point
actually.
he
has
testified
that
john
doe
was
present
at
11th
and
state
street
with
the
defendant.
we
know
that
person
--
we
know
that
person,
that
person
is
dead
as
i
understand
it."
so,
certainly
there
is
some
--
something
in
the
record
to
show
that
he
had
certainly
some
idea
as
to
who
this
man
was
and
when
you
consider
the
facts
of
the
case,
i
think
it
--
that
the
judge
might
well
have
--
have
thought
that
--
that
doe
knew
who
--
that
the
petitioner
knew
who
doe
was.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
i
--
i
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
think
that
--
that
it
goes
--
it
goes
toward
the
question.
certainly,
if
--
if
he
knew
who
he
was,
how
is
he
prejudiced?
mr.
james
w.
knapp
your
honor,
i
can
only
point
to
the
factual
circumstances
as
testified
to
the
agents
from
which
i
think
a
reasonable
person
might
conclude
that
the
petitioner
knew
who
doe
was.
for
example,
when
got
into
the
car
and
this
is
the
testimony
of
agent
--
of
officer
bryson
on
page
90,
when
this
party
got
into
the
automobile,
he
said
to
john
doe
hi.
so,
john
doe
said
hello.
he
says,
“i
have
to
wait
a
long
time
for
you.”
so,
he
said,
“yes,
i
know."
he
said,
“i
tried
to
get
you
at
the
place
and
i
tried
to
call
you
at
home
also.”
he
said,
“i
wanted
to
let
you
know
i'd
be
an
hour
late.
i
wanted
you
to
come
at
11:00
rather
than
10:00.”
certainly,
he
knew
where
to
call
him
at
the
place.
he
knew
where
to
call
him
at
home.
later
on,
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
he
said,
“what
about
the
other
money
you
owe
me?”
so,
john
doe
said,
“well,
i'm
doing
the
best
i
can.”
he
said,
“things
are
so
hot
now
it's
taking
me
a
long
time
to
put
it
all
down.”
“well,”
he
said,
“do
what
you
can
anyway.”
he
said,
“i
brought
you
three
pieces
this
time.”
and
then
when
he
left,
after
he
had
taken
the
package
containing
the
narcotics
from
the
tree
and
placed
it
in
the
car,
“okay,
here
it
is.
i'll
call
you
in
a
couple
of
days.”
now,
i
think
that
from
that
testimony
there's
certainly
is
the
inference
to
--
and
when
you
consider
that
together
with
the
evidence
of
the
officer
that
they
had
been
seen
together
on
two
occasions
before,
one
going
into
the
other's
house,
i
think
there's
at
least
a
strong
inference
that
he
had
some
idea
who
doe
was.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
mean
i
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
the
only
answer
that
i
can
--
can
say
to
that
--
to
that
question
is
that
if
they
have
disclosed
the
identity
of
this
person,
it
might
have
affected
other
cases.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that's
the
--
the
answer
that
--
the
reason
that
the
government
set
forth
for
not
wanting
to
disclose
doe.
the
--
in
resisting
the
disclosure
and
this
is
at
the
record
at
page
40,
the
government
advanced
the
reason
that
the
informants
work
in
more
cases
than
one,
that
there
are
other
matters
pending.
and
he
went
on
and
said
that
after
an
informant's
name
has
been
revealed,
he
is
worth
nothing.
and
another
time,
the
government
said
the
reason
is
because
he
is
acting
as
a
government
employee
in
other
cases
and
it
would
help
other
persons
in
matters
that
are
pending.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
now
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
that
is
exactly
--
that
the
fact
show
that
--
that
this
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
man
doe
was
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
that's
perhaps
an
initial
determination
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
that
they
--
they
have
to
be
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
except
in
making
some
inferences.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
that
--
that
is
exactly
it.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
that
is
exactly
it
and
we
think
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
there
is
no
--
nothing
to
show
that
doe
was
anything
other
than
a
cumulative
witness.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
we
do
not
concede
that
point,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
we
--
we
don't
concede
on
that
theory
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
--
to
disclosing.
i
admit
that
it
might
be
a
harder
position
to
assume
and
maintain
but
we
don't
necessarily
concede
that
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
it
--
it
was
in
error,
that
the
court
didn't
--
below
did
not
decide
there
that
issue.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
i
say
that
he
is
certainly
not
a
participant
in
the
possession
because
he
never
had
possession
of
it
at
least
until
it
was
put
in
his
car.
the
possession
was
taken
by
--
by
the
petitioner
roviaro,
he
picked
it
up
by
the
tree
and
he
took
it
over
and
he
put
it
in
the
car.
now,
it
may
be
a
transfer
of
possession
but
there's
no
joint
possession.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
it's
close
but
it's
not
quite
there.
i
mean
it's
actually
--
it's
a
transfer,
it's
not
a
joint
possession.
he
--
he
was
riding
around
in
his
car
with
it,
together.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
but
we've
--
i
think
that
the
explanation
of
that
is
perfectly
logical.
the
reason
though
--
and
it
was
proved
to
be
false.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
that
was
proved
to
be
false.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
i
think
there
again
that
--
that
if
--
if
there
had
been
any
real
question
of
mistaken
identity
here,
if
the
defense
had
proved,
for
example,
by
an
alibi
witnesses,
not
by
the
defendant
himself
would
--
would
--
roviaro
was
off
somewhere
else.
and
doe
again
his
name
might
have
been
--
been
important
and
--
and
perhaps
at
that
point
should
have
been
produced
but
until
there
is
any
evidence
along
that
line
or
any
showing
or
any
--
any
joining
of
issue,
there
was
--
there
was
no
reason
for
it.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
no,
i
--
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
of
bad
faith
here
on
part
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
we
don't
--
we
don't
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
don't
--
i
don't
feel
that
this
is
a
suppression,
a
case
of
any
suppression
at
all.
although,
the
government
has
disclosed
that
john
doe
was
there
and
they
relied
on
rule
of
law
through
defense
or
having
to
disclose
his
identity.
now
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
of
course
that
witness
could
testify
again.
but
again,
we
have
the
testimony
of
durham
who
says
i
picked
it
up
at
the
floor
of
the
car.
i
think
he
said
on
the
middle
strip.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
and
--
not
durham,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
he
put
his
initials
on
that
report
and
i'm
not
certain
whether
he
merely
initialed
the
weighing
of
it
or
not,
your
honor.
i
think
somewhere
in
the
record
i
ran
into
that,
but
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
but
in
any
event,
he
knew
about.
he
--
he
knew
about.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
in
--
in
any
event,
i
don't
believe
that
it's
too
important
who
picked
it
up,
your
honor,
whether
--
whether
bryson
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
who
picked
it
up,
whether
durham
picked
it
up.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
in
the
court
of
appeals,
your
honor,
said
to
our
minds
it
was
wholly
immaterial
to
have
found
the
package.
the
sworn
testimony
of
bryson
and
durham
is
not
at
variance
and
indeed
it
isn't,
while
bryson
did
not
testify
that
he
saw
durham
pick
up
the
package.
he
was
in
the
trunk
of
the
car
and
durham
picks
up
the
package
and
knocked
on
the
back
for
bryson
to
get
out,
so
bryson
didn't
see
it
but
he
saw
--
immediately
afterwards
he
saw
durham
in
possession
of
the
--
of
the
package.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
your
honor,
i
think
i
can
explain
that
best
with
--
with
reference
to
the
testimony
as
to
what
happened
to
this
package.
it
was
testified
by
durham
that
he
found
the
package.
bryson
said
that
he
saw
him
with
the
package
immediately
when
he
got
out
of
the
trunk.
sims
who
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
durham
with
(inaudible).
sims
who
was
up
at
the
corner
of
24th
and
st.lawrence
and
came
down
said
that
he
--
the
first
person
he
saw
with
the
package
was
--
was
durham.
i
think
all
police
officers
agree
that
the
package
was
field
tested
to
determine
the
nature
of
its
contents
by
durham
at
69th
and
some
place
out
in
chicago,
cottage
avenue
and
then
the
package
--
durham
says
that
he
gave
the
package
to
bryson
at
that
point.
and
--
and
at
that
point,
i
believe
there
is
a
conflict
in
testimony
as
whether
he
gave
it
to
bryson,
bryson
doesn't
say
that
he
did.
at
least
there
is
some
evidence
in
the
record
that
durham
gave
it
to
bryson.
the
package
was
then
taken
to
police
headquarters,
at
which
point
it
was
turned
over
to
fields.
now,
fields
was
down
on
the
street
with
bryson,
he
had
no
personal
knowledge
of
who
had
recovered
the
package.
it
could
have
been
either
bryson
or
durham.
and
fields
prepared
later
on,
i
think
they
went
home,
it
was
late
at
night
and
they
went
home
and
they
came
back
and
the
next
day
fields
prepared
exhibit
6.
now,
mr.
walsh
read
the
record
here
and
he
said
i
think
i
got
the
information
from
durham.
but
the
record
also
discloses
that
--
that
when
they
came
back
at
police
headquarters
there
was
some
dealing
with
this
package
and
in
fact
all
of
the
officers
present
initialed
the
glassine
envelope
containing
the
--
the
heroin
and
so
that
at
that
point
fields
might
well
have
been
confused
as
to
who
--
who
did
recover
the
--
the
package.
but
the
point
does
remain
of
course
that
--
that
durham
saw
exhibit
6
and
put
his
initials
on
it.
now,
your
--
i
would
like
to
go
to
point
two,
your
honor,
mainly
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
mainly
because
the
petitioner
has
--
has
argued
so
vociferously
about
it.
i
--
i
think
that
when
you
consider
the
evidence
here,
there
is
no
question
of
--
of
applying
a
presumption
to
say
that
we're
using
a
presumption
to
presume
knowledge
of
the
contents,
although
i
think
the
presumption
could
go
that
far.
actually,
when
you
consider
here
is
--
here
is
the
petitioner,
he
gets
out
of
his
car
and
then
another
man
slides
over
and
drives
it
off
and
he
--
the
petitioner
gets
in
along
side
of
doe
in
the
passenger's
compartment,
they
drive
by
a
circuitous
route
and
somewhere
along
the
route
they
slowed
down
and
then
they
come
to
a
complete
stop
and
they
turn
off
their
lights,
then
a
minute
or
two
later
they
start
on
again
and
they
come
to
the
tree
and
the
petitioner
gets
out
and
he
walks
over
to
the
tree,
here
it
is
11:30
at
night,
tree
was
well
lighted.
now,
here
--
but
he
walks
over
to
the
tree
and
picks
up
this
package
and
he
puts
it
in
the
car
and
says
here
it
is
i'll
see
you
tomorrow.
he
walks
down
the
street
and
carry
at
the
(inaudible)
and
then
further
down
st.lawrence
and
gets
back
in
his
car
four
blocks
from
where
he
left
it.
obviously,
a
prearranged
meeting
with
whoever
drove
his
car
away.
obviously,
he
knew
where
to
stop
at
the
tree
to
get
out.
there
was
the
conduct
of
going
down
around
the
circuitous
route
was
surreptitious.
i
think
from
those
facts
you
might
well
find
that
he
knew
what
was
in
that
package
regardless
of
any
presumption.
certainly,
we
(voice

--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
is
it
--
is
it
fair
and
is
it
right
for
the
government
to
prevent
the
defendant
from
having
the
opportunity
to
talk
to
and
subpoena
the
only
other
man
who
might
be
able
to
help
him
in
his
defense?
mr.
james

(voice

mr.
james
w.

in
that
--
in
that
--
mr.
james
w.

i'm
not
questioning
them
here
at
all.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
that
--
well,
that
gets
it
back
again
to
the
policy
and
the
reasons
why
the
government
didn't
want
to
disclose
the
identity
of
this
person.
he
was
--
he
was
useful
in
--
in
enforcing
the
narcotic
law

mr.
james

--
and
to
--
and
to

to
disclosing
at
this
point,
i
think
the

has
pointed
out
would

would
affect
future
cases
and
i
want
to
be

mr.

can't

that,

they

mr.
james

well,
but
still
i

i
don't
see
that

that
it's

this
material

mr.

to
defer
that

that
the

that
it's
prejudicial

he
hasn't
shown
that
this
witness
would

would
aide
him
in
anyway,
he
doesn't
contend
that
(voice

mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
of
course
there,
the
witnesses
also
testified
to
their
own
knowledge
that
that
was
false.
mr.

excuse
me,
your
honor.

mr.

i
think

it's

mr.
james

i
think
it's
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
think
it's
--
i
think
it's
a
matter
for
the
trial
court
to
determine
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
whether
on
the

--
mr.
james

--
it's
certainly
disclosed.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
but,
your
honor,
when
--
when
he
is
--
he
is
faced
with
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
he
is
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
when
the
trial
court
is
--
is
faced
with
this
one
rule
of
policy
and
the
other,
the
rule
of
justice,
he
has
to
make
a
determination
based
upon
the
facts
which
are
before
him.
and
i
think
he
might
well
have
decided
that
this
was
only
a
strategy
employed
by
doe
and
the
government
to
--
to
keep
the
--
the
petitioner
from
becoming
aware
of
the
identity
of
a
person
who
had
been
useful
to
the
government.
i
think
that
further
that
he
might
well
have
considered
and
weighed
the
facts
of
all
the
testimony
and
thought
that
in
any
event
there
is
no
prejudice
here
because
the
--
there
is
this
very
strong
probability
that
he
knows
who
doe
was.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
in
weighing
it
all,
he
would
feel
that
there
was
no
prejudice
to
the
defendant
particularly
where
there's
no
evidence
has
been
brought
other
than
this
--
this
one
instance
controverting
the
government's
testimony
as
to
the
guilt
of
the
defendant.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
i
--
i
think
--
of
course
your
honor
is
--
is
correct
that
--
that
where
--
but
where
he
feels
that
--
that
it
would
be
necessary
in
the
interest
of
justice
that
he
would
have
to
order
the
government
to
produce
him
(voice

--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
but
he
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
--
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
no,
but
i
think
he
can
--
he
can
say
that
on
the
facts
here
i
find
that
there
is
--
is
no
probability
that
this
man
is
going
to
--
to
testify
in
anyway
favorable.
that
--
that
effects
don't
show
to
me
that
he
--
he
possesses
(voice

--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
no,
but
he
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
he
certainly
have
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
--
i
frankly
--
personally
feel
that
this
is
a
legal
jiujitsu
on
mr.
walsh's
part.
he's
--
he's
using
the
government
to
try
to
throw
the
government.
and
it's
perfectly
all
right,
but
i
still
haven't
seen
how
he
has
made
out
any
real
substantial
issue
that
though
it
produced
would
--
would
be
of
any
assistance
to
the
court
in
the
determination
of
the
factual
issue.
there
--
there
was
no
--
they
had
--
they
never
controverted
the
facts
in
any
other
way.
certainly,
if
those
testimony
was
to
be
expected
to
be
helpful
to
them,
they
would
have
done
that
and
they
didn't
do
it.
i
say
they
can't
stand
still
and
say
here
we're
entitled
to
his
name
without
any
further
showing
and
that
--
that's
the
point.
they
have,
i
say,
though
we
--
we
have
some
slight
disagreement
on
the
incident
at
the
police
station,
but
i
still
feel
that
--
that
they
have
not
made
out
any
real
issue
here
which
would
show
that
those
testimony
would
be
of
any
assistance
to
them
in
their
defense.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
your
honor,
if
--
if
the
witness
would
be
unfavorable
to
them
and
favorable
to
the
other
side,
i
don't
see
how
it
could
honorably
withhold
him.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
in
this
case,
the
--
the
defendant
himself
was
in
the
position
of
knowing.
i
--
i
believe
(voice

--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
your
honor
of
course
we
can
--
we
could
stay
here
and
imagine
a
great
many
things
that
joe
doe
might
say.
we
don't
know
on
the
state
of
the
record
what
he
would
say.
we
can
imagine
but
my
point
is
it
is
not
a
matter
of
imagination,
you
can
always
imagine
that
he
would
say
something
that
would
be
directly
favorable
to
the
petitioner
or
--
or
contrary
to
the
government
but
there
has
been
no
showing
that
he
would
or
that
there's
any
likelihood
that
he
would.
and
that's
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
the
point
that
i
say
that
until
he
does
do
that
and
show
that
there
is
some
necessity
for
him
that
the
--
that
the
identity
should
not
be
disclosed
in
instances
whether
the
--
the
man
is
necessary
for
the
government
in
future
--
enforcement
of
future
(voice

--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
if
--
if
that
had
been
true
that
is
certainly
something
we
have
to
--
that
the
(voice

--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
he
did
say
that.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
at
the
least
it
says,
he
said
it
at
first.
at
first
he
did
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
was
the
answer
i
mean
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
that
he
--
he
contended
it
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
and
if
--
if
there
were
any
real
question
of
identity,
of
course,
we
realize
that
the
defendant
is
not
required
to
take
the
stand.
well,
he
has
a
right
to
do
it
and
--
and
a
person
who
is
innocent,
i
--
of
course
your
honors
explained
many
reasons
why
he
might
not
desire
to
controvert,
but
i
should
think
that
he
would
and
if
he
had,
i
say
the
man
should
have
been
produced
at
that
point.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
the
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
the
only
other
point
briefly
as
to
--
to
point
three,
i
think
our
brief
adequately
covers
the
point
that
there
was
no
showing
there
that
the
--
that
the
report
of
agent
durham
would
in
anyway
be
controversial
of
--
of
durham's
own
testimony,
they
only
showed
that
he
made
a
report,
they
didn't
show
what
was
in
it.
and
in
the
gordon
and
krulewitch
case,
there
was
a
showing
on
the
part
of
the
witnesses.
they
have
made
prior
contradictory
statements.
now,
as
to
point
two,
i
think
i
have
started
to
--
in
the
main
point
that
i
have
there
is
that
--
that
the
facts
as
shown
are
consistent
with
a
knowledge
of
the
content
of
the
package
and
that
you
don't
have
to
rely
upon
the
presumption
to
presume
the
contents,
however,
i
do
think
that
the
yee
ham
case
goes
almost
so
far
as
to
--
to
hold
that
that
presumption
would
create
a
presumption
that
he
knew
that
there
was
heroin
in
the
package
and
that
it
would
be
therefore
incumbent
upon
him
to
explain
it
and
that
would
not
be
an
unreasonable
presumption
in
view
of
the
fact
that
heroin
is
not
legally
possible
to
be
manufactured
or
produced
in
this
country
and
you
cannot
import
opium
for
the
purpose
of
producing
heroin.
and
as
i
understand
that
no
legal
heroin
in
the
united
states
or
if
there
is,
it's
a
very
incontestable
quantity.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
they
--
they
say
that
as
to
count
2
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
say
that
he
is
not
a
participant
in
the
possession.
if
you
leave
out
count
1
in
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
evidence
as
to
count
1,
you
have
clearly
evidence
of
eye
witnesses
to
the
actual
possession
and
transportation
of
the
--
of
the
heroin
by
the
petitioner.
the
--
the
john
doe
was
in
no
sense
a
participant
in
that.
he
was
sitting
in
the
car
and
as
that
i
would
say
is
no
more
than
any
other
observer,
a
person
who
for
instance
was
standing
across
the
street
and
saw
it
or
someone
in
a
house
looking
out
a
window
and
might
have
seen
it,
that
--
that
john
doe
was
not
a
participant
in
that
actual
possession
and
transportation
of
the
heroin
from
the
tree
to
the
car.
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
and
i
think
that
that
is
certainly
as
to
count
2,
that
--
that
he
certainly
was
not
a
participant
--
not
a
participant
in
the
offense.
i
don't
think
he
had
possession
to
it,
put
in
his
car.
thank
you,
your
honor.
