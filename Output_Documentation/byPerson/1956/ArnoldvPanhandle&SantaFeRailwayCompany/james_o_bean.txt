mr.
james
o.
bean
mr.
chief
justice
--
justice
warren,
if
your
honors
please.
this
is
another
action
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
tried
in
a
state
tribunal
where
the
petitioner
obtained
a
favorable
verdict
and
judgment.
appeal
to
the
appellate
court,
the
court
of
civil
appeals
in
amarillo
in
the
seventh
district
reversed
and
rendered
a
take-nothing
judgment
for
an
injured
employee
of
the
respondent.
the
decision
was
reversed
on
local
practice
and
procedure
pertaining
to
special
issues
whether
or
not
the
issue
of
unsafe
place
is
an
ultimate
issue
or
whether
it
is
overridden
or
destroyed
by
some
other
issues.
that
basically
is
the
argument
here
i
believe,
your
honors.
then
to
the
action
of
the
amarillo
court
in
taking
away
the
jury
verdict
was
an
invasion.
i
think
it
becomes
important
to
know
the
facts
here
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
issue
of
unsafe-place
was
raised.
first,
the
railroad,
the
respondent,
the
panhandle
and
santa
fe
railway
company
had
constructed
a
passageway
or
a
driveway
adjacent
to
its
station
for
the
use
of
a
mail
truck
operated
by
a
contractor,
billings,
who
had
a
contract
with
the
government
to
pick
up
and
deliver
mail.
the
petitioner,
arnold,
was
a
car
inspector
for
the
respondent.
it
was
his
duty
to
inspect
cars
not
--
not
in
any
particular
time
but
that
was
his
job
and
the
facts
will
show
that
he
had
the
right
to
select
the
time
that
he
made
the
inspection.
on
the
occasion
of
his
injury,
january
the
16th,
1952,
while
working
in
the
yards
at
lubbock,
texas
and
while
inspecting
three
cars
which
the
railroad
respondent
had
placed
on
his
spur
track
for
that
purpose,
or
person
for
that
purpose,
he
was
ran
over
by
this
mail
truck
which
was
backing
out
blind.
petitioner
takes
the
position
that
the
railroad
created
this
unsafe
place
on
his
premises
because
it
not
only
constructed
and
built
the
one
way
drive
but
directed
its
employee
to
work
on
the
cars
there.
admittedly,
the
drive
where
the
injury
was
sustained
was
too
narrow
for
the
use
of
a
truck
and
the
employee
at
the
same
time.
one
must
give
way
to
the
other.
as
one
of
the
witnesses
testified,
it
is
a
very
tight
spot.
now,
the
jury
found
in
support
of
petitioner's
contention
that
the
railroad
was
negligent
in
failing
to
furnish
a
reasonably
safe
place.
that
was
the
approximate
cause,
not
the
sole
cause
but
a
proximate
cause.
the
jury
also
found
on
other
issues
that
the
petitioner,
mr.
arnold,
was
guilty
of
contributory
negligence
and
that
he
had
already
seen
the
truck
--
the
mail
truck
parked
down
that
driveway
and
he
turned
his
back
to
it
and
walked
away
after
performing
his
car
inspection,
and
that
he
was
guilty
of
negligence
in
failing
to
keep
a
proper
lookout
for
himself
which
approximately
caused
his
injury.
now,
may
i
specifically
point
out
here,
your
honors,
that
the
jury
found
that
to
be
only
a
proximate
cause.
the
amarillo
court
says
it
was
the
sole
proximate
cause.
the
amarillo
court
also
went
further
to
say
that
the
man's
injuries
were
sustained
solely
by
reason
of
the
presence
of
the
billings
truck.
billings'
truck
under
the
facts
and
--
and
the
fact
--
the
pertinent
facts
here
are
contained
in
the
testimony
of
three
witnesses,
the
petitioner
arnold,
mr.
humphrey
(ph),
the
station
agent
and
mr.
billings,
the
third
party
contractor.
the
--
mr.
james
o.
bean
--
railroad
--
mr.
james
o.
bean
the
photographs
and
evidence
are
at
288,
that
--
mr.
james
o.
bean
--
it's
substantially,
your
honor,
the
same
situation.
there
is
some
testimony
in
the
record
that
the
park
--
that
the
truck
as
it
was
taking
on
mail
in
front
of
the
cars
was
parked
at
a
little
greater
angle
than
shown
in
this
particular
picture.
mr.
james
o.
bean
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
get
your
--
mr.
james
o.
bean
no,
your
honor.
that
is
a
park.
there's
a
slight
drop
there
perhaps
but
actually
--
immediately
to
the
left
of
the
driveway
is
a
park
with
green
grass
on
it
which
is
something
unusual.
mr.
james
o.
bean
park.
mr.
james
o.
bean
the
--
the
driveway,
your
honor,
is
constructed
of
pressed
gravel,
rolled
gravel
and
there's
a
slight
drop
off
that
leads
to
the
park
immediately
west.
now,
the
picture,
the
photograph
does
not
show
clearly
the
grass
but
there
was
grass
and
perhaps
some
gravel
immediately
next
to
the
driveway.
mr.
james
o.
bean
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
o.
bean
the
testimony
of
the
petitioner
was
that
the
inspection
was
in
on
top
and
below,
all
over.
mr.
james
o.
bean
no,
the
--
the
truck
was
backing
out
at
the
time
it
hit
petitioner,
but
at
the
time
petitioner
began
his
work
in
the
cars,
he
saw
the
truck
parked
there
taking
on
mail,
parked
at
an
angle
back
in
against
the
cars.
mr.
james
o.
bean
correct
--
mr.
james
o.
bean
--
your
honor.
that's
our
--
mr.
james
o.
bean
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
o.
bean
that
was
a
jury
finding
on
the
--
the
issue
submitted
was
whether
or
not
it
was
an
unsafe
place
for
him
to
work.
mr.
james
o.
bean
too
narrow,
yes,
sir.
not
only
that,
your
honor,
but
the
railroad
controlled
the
very
movement
of
the
truck
and
that
it
told
the
driver
and
the
owner
of
the
truck,
don't
use
our
parkway,
don't
turn
around
out
there.
if
you
drive
in
forward,
you
back
out.
if
you
back
in,
you
drive
that
far.
the
only
inference
is
to
the
south.
mr.
james
o.
bean
yes,
sir.
that
is
the
testimony,
your
honor.
there
were
also
specific
instructions
to
the
driver
and
the
owner
of
the
truck,
don't
pull
forward
around
our
station.
use
that
drive
and
that
drive
only,
that's
what
we
build
it
for,
yet
at
the
same
time
its
employee
was
required
to
work
on
and
about
the
cars.
a
further
point,
your
honor,
is
--
my
contention
is
that
the
railroad
created
that
dangerous
situation
because
railroad
employees
were
actually
assisting
and
loading
the
truck
with
mail
and
loaded
the
truck
so
high
with
mail
that
the
driver
could
not
see
out
of
the
rear
window
in
the
car.
the
only
means
he
had
a
vision
was
--
were
mirrors
on
either
side
and
a
testimony
is
that
he
could
not
see
the
petitioner,
arnold,
as
he
was
walking
away
from
the
last
car.
and
for
that
reason,
he
backed
blindly
and
ran
into
him.
the
contention
of
the
respondent
is
that
since
the
jury
exonerated
the
railroad
and
that
it
found
that
the
railroad
was
not
negligent
in
permitting
the
truck
to
occupy
the
premises
or
use
his
driveway
that
that
destroyed
the
findings
by
the
jury
of
unsafe
place.
going
on
further,
the
amarillo
court
which
rendered
a
take-nothing
judgment
and
reversed
and
rendered
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
found
that
the
injury
was
solely
due
to
the
presence
of
the
truck.
i
do
not
think
that
is
a
proper
application
of
the
facts
because
certainly
as
your
honor
said
in
the
roger's
case,
the
railroad
in
constructing
such
a
narrow
passageway
contributed
a
little
bit
to
the
injuries
of
the
petitioner.
mr.
james
o.
bean
yes
sir,
a
fact
issue
in
our
favor,
your
honor.
the
amarillo
court
of
whose
judgment
we
complain
also
found
that
the
negligence
of
petitioner,
arnold,
in
failing
to
keep
a
proper
lookout
was
the
sole
proximate
cause
of
his
injuries.
notwithstanding,
the
jury
found
a
sole
cause
only
and
as
its
sole
cause,
no,
that
was
not
--
mr.
james
o.
bean
yes.
mr.
james
o.
bean
the
damage
issue
was
answered
$30,000
then
there
was
another
issue,
how
much
did
his
negligence
--
petitioner's
negligence
contributed.
and
they
found
12,000
so
that
the
jury
deducted
12,000
over
that
30,000,
leaving
a
verdict
of
$18,000
to
petitioner.
in
that
finding,
they
took
care
of
the
contributory
negligence.
they
penalized
him
to
that
extent.
one
further
point
here,
the
amarillo
court
took
the
position
that
the
unsafe
place
issue
and
i'm
paraphrasing,
it
was
longer
than
that
but
in
this
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
place
of
the
respondent
was
unsafe.
the
amarillo
court
held
that
it
was
not
an
ultimate
issue,
it
was
a
general
issue.
if
it
is
a
general
issue,
if
your
honors
please,
it
is
a
general
issue
authorized
by
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
because
the
act,
volume
45
section
51
in
the
code
provides
that
one
may
obtain
damages
from
the
railroad
due
to
negligence
of
its
agent,
servants
or
employees.
partly
cause
--
partly
causing
the
injury
but
the
issue
on
unsafe
place
is
based
on
the
other
face
of
the
law
where
the
railroad
itself
is
negligent
in
providing
a
place
with
defects
or
insufficiencies.
so
what
would
be
the
difference
in
the
issue
whether
we
use
the
word
unsafe
or
insufficiently
wide
pathway?
i
do
not
feel
that
the
respondent
can
answer
the
position
of
the
petitioner
here,
that
this
right
of
recovery
under
the
federal
act
was
destroyed
by
the
local
practice
regarding
special
issues
in
our
state.
it
was
a
--
he
has
briefed
a
good
common
law
action
but
he
misses
the
point
on
federal
employers'
liability
act
because
the
act
provides
if
it
can
--
if
the
railroad
contributed
a
little
bit
in
its
negligence
to
the
injuries
of
the
petitioner,
then
we
are
entitled
to
the
damages
as
found
by
the
jury.
this
court
has
so
reasonably
held
in
a
similar
case
from
my
state,
on
a
similar
fact
situation
in
the
deen
versus
gulf,
colorado
and
santa
fe
who
wasn't
--
which
was
not
published
at
the
time
or
out
at
the
time
we
wrote
our
brief,
the
same
fact
situation
except
there
it
was
inadequate
or
insufficient
too.
here,
it
is
insufficient
for
an
unsafe
place
because
of
the
premises
being
too
narrow.
i
think
the
most
applicable
case
though
under
the
facts
is
the
cahill
case
decided
by
this
honorable
court
some
time
ago.
in
that
case,
if
you
will
recall,
there
was
an
employee
of
the
railroad
standing
behind
the
train
flagging
motor
traffic
and
the
truck
hit
the
employee
and
the
holding
of
the
court
in
new
york
was
that
the
truck's
negligence
or
for
its
negligence
as
i
recall
was
the
sole
proximate
cause.
this
court
said
not
the
so.
the
facts
raised
the
issue
of
unsafe
place
because
it
was
returned
for
further
consideration
of
evidence,
admissibility
of
evidence
on
car
collisions
at
that
particular
intersection.
it
is
the
further
contention
of
petitioner
here
that
the
facts
raised
abundantly
the
issue
of
unsafe
place
because
the
unsafety
which
is
admitted
to
some
extent
in
respondent's
brief
was
created
by
the
railroad
and
its
ownership,
its
operation,
its
maintenance
and
control
of
not
only
its
premises
but
the
very
movement
of
the
truck
which
hit
the
petitioner.
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
some
of
my
time
to
answer
the
respondent.
mr.
james
o.
bean
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors,
it
was
the
appellate
court
that
rendered
the
judgment
against
the
petitioner,
the
trial
court
inner
judgment
in
his
favor.
and
the
railroad
appealed
it
to
the
beaumont
--
amarillo
court
of
appeals
which
reversed
it
and
rendered
it,
took
it
away
from
the
petitioner.
it
is
our
petition
here,
and
i
think
it
is
now
narrowed
down
to
this
point,
that
the
amarillo
court
and
so
this
citing
substituted
its
finding
for
that
of
the
jury
on
safe
place.
and
held
just
as
counsel
has
been
arguing
that
the
very
presence
of
the
truck
was
the
sole
cause
of
the
unsafe
place,
therefore,
he's
not
entitled
to
anything.
there
--
may
i
make
this
argument
very
short,
but
i
think
there
are
two
lines
of
testimony
and
take
nothing
else
that
answers
that.
mr.
james
o.
bean
well,
the
men
worked
all
around
the
cars,
your
honor.
mr.
james
o.
bean
surely,
as
i
see
it,
your
honor.
mr.
james
o.
bean
right,
sir
--
right,
sir.
and
in
this
particular
essence,
your
honor,
the
testimony
of
the
truck
driver
was
that
it
was
an
overall
tight
place
that
raises
the
issue,
in
fact.
the
testimony
of
the
owner
of
the
truck,
mr.
billings
“i
took
what
the
railroad
made
for
me.”
what?
a
driveway
too
narrow
for
the
occupancy
of
the
workman
and
the
truck
at
the
same
time
and
the
workman's
last
act
was
to
reach
under
the
car
as
far
as
he
could
with
a
claw
hammer
and
turn
a
valve
in
order
to
convert
the
cars
from
--
pass
new
service
to
freight
service
as
there
were
going
out
that
night
by
freight
and
turned
his
back
to
the
truck
and
walked
away
and
was
hit
by
the
truck.
so,
the
whole
position
is
here,
that
the
amarillo
court
invaded
the
province
of
the
jury
when
it
took
away
that
verdict
on
its
own
facts,
because
there
is
ample
evidence,
as
mr.
justice
brennan
has
pointed
out
to
support
that
one
issue
of
unsafe
place.
the
respondent
has
briefed
this
case
and
argued
this
case
on
state
law,
state
rule.
he
cites
the
special
issue
law
and
his
appendix.
but
that's
narrowing
the
field
which
the
federal
government
has
given
all
railroad
employees.
and
to
this,
to
us,
this
case
is
more
important
than
just
to
the
litigants
here.
do
the
railroad
employees
of
texas
are
the
railroad
employees'
of
texas
entitled
to
the
same
benefits
under
the
act
as
other
states
or
should
we
go
across
the
line
in
oklahoma
where
they
do
not
have
special
issue
law
to
get
the
benefits
of
this
liberal
act
that
this
court
has
so
many
times
held.
counsel
was
just
now
arguing
assumed
risk
because
he
selected
that
time
himself,
that's
out
of
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
we
think
the
amarillo
court
should
be
reversed
and
the
trial
court
reinstated
under
all
of
the
facts
in
this
case.
