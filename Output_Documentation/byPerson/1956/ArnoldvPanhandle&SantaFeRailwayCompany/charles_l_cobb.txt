mr.
charles
l.
cobb
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors.
in
the
first
place,
i
would
like
to
point
out
some
distinctions
between
the
deen
case
which
was
decided
by
this
honorable
court
just
a
few
weeks
ago
and
this
case.
i
happen
to
be
familiar
with
the
deen
case.
there,
the
question
was
whether
the
railway
company
was
required
to
furnish
two
safe
ways
to
do
the
job.
this
court
held
that
the
case
should
be
reversed
to
determine
that
question.
also,
there
was
no
contention
in
the
deen
case
that
specific
issues
controlled
a
general
issue.
now,
that
is
our
contention
here.
they
submitted
over
our
objection
in
the
trial
of
this
case
the
general
issue
as
to
whether
this
defendant
failed
to
furnish
a
reasonably
safe
place
to
work.
we
object
to
that
because
it
was
general.
there
was
no
definition
of
safe
place
to
work.
it
was
controlled
and
it
could
be
controlled
by
specific
issues.
petitioner
in
the
trial
court
requested
specific
issues
which
went
to
the
question
of
reasonable
safe
place
to
work
and
they
were
submitted
by
the
trial
court
along
with
this
general
issue.
those
specifics,
which
are
found
in
the
court's
chart
referred
to
in
our
brief
in
which
i
will
discuss
if
time
permits,
fully
took
out
of
the
case
any
question
of
our
failure
to
furnish
a
reasonably
safe
place
to
work.
now,
there
is
one
other
thing
that
i'm
not
sure
that
this
court
is
clear
on
to
this
point
in
the
argument
and
that
is
this,
there
were
two
defendants
in
the
trial
of
this
case
in
the
trial
court.
this
truck
was
not
owned
by
the
panhandle
and
santa
fe
railway
company,
the
respondent
here.
it
was
owned
and
operated
by
billings
transfer
and
storage
company.
this
transfer
and
storage
company
had
a
contract
with
the
united
states
government
for
the
hauling
of
mail.
and
it
was
the
employee
billings
who
ran
over
and
injured
this
petitioner.
in
pleading
the
case
in
the
trial
court,
there
were
seven
allegations
of
negligence
as
against
the
railway
company.
there
were
11
allegations
of
negligence
as
against
billings.
when
all
of
these
issues
were
presented
to
the
jury,
the
juy
exonerated
the
truck
driver
who
committed
the
overt
act
from
backing
without
giving
a
warning,
from
backing
without
clear
vision
that
is
backing
his
truck,
from
driving
too
fast.
the
jury
exonerated
this
defendant
billings
from
all
of
those
specific
acts
of
negligence.
it
too
exonerated
panhandle
and
santa
fe
railway
company,
petitioner,
of
all
specific
acts
of
negligence
but
it
found
against
it
on
the
one
general
issue.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
as
to
the
--
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
the
jury
found
for
example,
your
honor,
that
the
railway
company
was
not
negligent
in
permitting
the
truck
to
use
this
very
area
at
this
very
time,
a
specific.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
the
jury
also
found
that
this
railway
company
did
not
fail
to
keep
a
proper
lookout
for
mr.
arnold.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
as
to
the
operation
of
the
truck
and
also
--
as
to
giving
him
warning.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
the
jury
found
--
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
on
the
presence,
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
that's
all
related
to
the
truck
and
all
related
to
anything
that
this
company,
this
--
this
respondent
had
to
do
--
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
--
with
the
truck.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
yes,
sir,
it's
related
to
the
area.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
maybe
i
misunderstood
mr.
justice
brennan
--
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
--
on
that.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
number
2.
that
has
to
do
with
the
--
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
--
area.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
which
includes
these
special
issues
is
found
beginning
at
page
344
of
the
record.
the
--
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
oh,
as
to
the
area
--
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
it's
found
at
page
346.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
number
7.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
it's
also
found
there
i
believe,
sir,
because
that
is
--
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
--
the
charge
itself.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
if
the
court
please,
these
issues
are
taken
in
groups.
you
will
notice
that
7,
8
and
9
are
grouped
together.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
one
inquires
as
to
the
area,
do
you
find
from
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
only
occasioned
in
question.
the
defendant,
panhandle
and
santa
fe
railway
company,
permitted
motor
trucks
to
be
driven
on
an
area
used
by
plaintiff
arnold
in
the
performance
of
his
work.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
perhaps
--
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
yes,
and
the
area
which
presumably
was
under
the
control
of
the
--
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
--
respondent
here.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
yes,
sir,
that's
right
on
this
particular
area.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
this
is
the
specific
because
it
was
only
on
an
area
involved.
the
testimony
was
undisputed
that
this
was
the
area
involved
and
the
only
area
involved.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
number
7,
sir.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
it's
312
and
--
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
that's
right.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
i
do,
sir,
for
the
--
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
i
do,
sir,
because
this
was
the
only
area
on
which
there
was
any
evidence
and
which
there
is
any
evidence
in
the
record
of
the
case.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
number
8,
as
i
started
to
say
a
minute
ago
is
taken
in
connection
with
number
7.
these
are
presented
in
groups
of
three.
number
of
8,
has
to
do
with
permitting
such
use
on
the
park
of
the
defendant
railway
company
but
there
are
corollary
issues.
one
asks
as
to
the
fact,
the
other
as
to
negligence,
and
the
other
as
to
proximate
cause.
now
--
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
that's
right.
that's
the
way
they
summarized
those
issues.
it
takes
three
of
them
and
sometimes
four
in
this
particular
charge
to
make
a
complete
negligence
issue.
you
first
inquire
as
i
say
as
to
the
fact
then
as
to
negligence
and
then
as
to
proximate
cause
and
in
some
instances
here
there
is
the
inquiry
as
to
sole
proximate
cause.
now,
if
the
court
reviews
the
record
in
the
case
of
this
kind
and
i
assume
from
decision
which
i
read
that
the
record
is
very
largely
reviewed.
it
will
say
that
mr.
arnold
came
to
this
particular
spot
on
the
morning
that
he
was
injured
before
the
truck
ever
got
there.
he
placed
what
is
known
as
a
blue
flag
at
the
end
of
one
of
the
baggage
cars
to
indicate
that
a
man
was
at
work,
and
then
he
left
this
particular
scene
and
he
came
back
about
20
minutes
later.
when
he
came
back,
he
saw
that
the
truck
operated
by
the
other
defendant
was
there
unloading
mail.
in
fact,
he
got
into
the
very
baggage
car
where
the
truck
was
unloading
the
mail.
he
states
that
he
noticed
at
the
time
that
the
truck
was
full,
that
it
was
so
loaded
with
mail
that
the
driver
couldn't
see
at
the
back.
yet
he
walks
down
through
the
next
baggage
car,
gets
out
and
starts
his
work
knowing
that
the
truck
is
there
on
this
driveway.
the
evidence
is
undisputed
that
he
knew
that
this
truck
came
there
from
day
to
day
and
used
this
particular
driveway.
that
he
was
required
to
--
the
truck
was
required
to
back
out
instead
of
--
to
go
forward.
that
is
undisputed.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors,
when
court
recessed
on
yesterday,
i
was
making
the
prime
point
of
the
respondent
in
this
case
that
the
jury
in
its
verdict
on
specific
issues
found
that
respondent
was
not
guilty
of
any
negligence
and
that
these
specific
issues
control
and
delimited
the
one
general
issue
answered
in
favor
of
petitioner
on
failure
to
furnish
a
reasonable
safe
place
to
work.
now,
with
the
courts
permission,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
page
13
of
petitioner's
brief.
on
that
page
and
in
the
second
grammatical
paragraph,
petitioner
seeks
to
set
out
the
points
upon
which
he
relies
for
an
unreasonable
place
to
work.
i
would
like
to
take
those
points
up,
one
by
one,
and
show
how
the
jury
has
found
on
specific
issues
against
petitioner.
the
paragraph
begins
this
way,
"with
reference
to
respondent's
duty
to
furnish
petitioner,
a
reasonably
safe
place
to
work,
the
evidence
showed
that
petitioner
was
struck
by
a
truck
which
was
backing
up.
i'll
write
in
that
connection,
let
us
refer
to
the
jury's
answer,
this
special
issue
number
17
shown
in
the
record
at
page
315
wherein
the
jury
found
that
it
was
not
negligence
for
the
truck
to
back
up
and
that
is
the
first
point
that
he
makes.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
i
take
the
position,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
jury
verdict
must
be
construed
as
a
whole,
that
we
cannot
take
anyone
particular
issue
and
decide
the
case
that
there
was
a
specific
issue
asked
as
to
the
question
of
the
truck
backing
up.
and
that
the
jury
found
that
that
was
not
negligence.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
all
right.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
now,
that
is
my
second
point,
if
the
court
please,
on
a
specific
issue.
the
court
brings
in
next
the
question
of
the
10
foot
8
inch
gravel
driveway.
in
that
connection,
i
would
refer
the
chief
justice
to
special
issues
number
7
and
8
appearing
at
page
12
of
the
record.
now,
special
issue
number
7
asked
on
the
occasion
in
question
and
on
an
area
in
question,
did
the
respondent
permit
a
truck
to
be
driven,
the
jury
says,
“yes.”
now,
bear
in
mind,
if
the
chief
justice
please,
that
is
on
a
particular
area
on
the
question
on
the
occasion
in
question.
and
answer
to
special
issue
number
8,
which
is
a
corollary
issue
to
special
issue
number
7.
the
question
is
this,
do
you
find
from
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
such
act
in
permitting
such
use,
if
any
on
the
part
of
the
defendant,
panhandle
and
santa
fe
railway
company,
was
negligence?
the
jury's
answer
is
no.
who
take
the
position
that
that
is
specific
with
regard
to
the
area,
the
10
foot
8
inch
driveway?
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
that
could
take
in
the
number
of
things,
if
the
chief
justice
please.
that
--
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
we
take
the
position
that
that
is
not
what
they
held
for
several
reasons.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
there
was
anything
else
other
than
these
specifics,
the
very
pleading
of
the
plaintiff,
the
petitioner
and
the
trial
court
points
out
these
specifics.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
that's
correct.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
that's
true.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
might
i
answer
that
in
this
way,
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
--
this
court
in
the
tiller
case,
held
that
even
in
a
federal
employers'
liability
act
case
that
there
must
be
a
causal
connection
between
the
alleged
negligence
and
the
injury
before
the
railway
company
is
responsible.
now,
that
is
my
answer
to
that
and
those
(voice
overlap)
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
that's
true.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
now,
that's
number
1.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
that's
true.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
the
test
in
rogers
was
not
dissatisfied
for
this
reason,
the
petitioner
in
the
trial
court
claimed
the
right
to
submit
his
case
both
generally
on
the
general
issue
of
safe
place
to
work
and
specifically
on
the
specific
issues
over
objection.
those
objections
were
duly
made.
i
know
that
there
are
cases
before
this
court
where
the
same
question
has
arisen
but
the
objection
was
not
taken
at
the
time
by
opposing
counsel.
this
amounts
to
a
double
submission
of
the
case,
the
way
this
case
was
submitted
by
this
trial
court.
and
that
is
what
the
court
of
civil
appeals
and
amarillo
has
held.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
yes,
sir.
that's
true
too.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
that's
true
enough,
sir.
and
the
court
of
civil
appeals
have
so
recognized.
but
this
is
one
instance
where
we
appointed
out
a
federal
rule.
federal
rule
49
permits
such
a
submission
as
this
and
it's
very
often
that
federal
courts
do
submit
in
cases
upon
special
issues
or
special
questions.
and
it
has
been
held
by
this
court
on
numerous
occasions
that
where
a
case
is
submitting,
both
on
the
general
issue
and
upon
specifics,
that
the
specifics
control.
in
fact,
justice
holmes
and
--
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
no,
sir.
that
was
not
submitted
specifically.
it
was
not
requested.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
yes,
sir,
i
am
because
the
petitioner
submitted
that
issue
in
number
7
and
number
8.
those
issues
were
asked
--
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
it
could
be
on
the
area
--
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
we
have
also
traded
with
this
question
of
requiring
petitioner
to
work
in
that
area
in
our
brief.
the
uncontroverted
testimony
in
this
case
is
that
petitioner
shows
the
place
that
he
was
going
to
work
and
that
he
worked
there
of
his
own
volition,
that
he
did
not
have
to
work
there
at
that
particular
time.
he
chose
the
place
where
he
was
to
work.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
that's
correct,
sir.
but
he
could
have
worked
anywhere
in
the
u.s.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
it
was
in
furtherance
of
his
employer's
business,
but
he
was
his
own
boss
at
this
time.
he
came
to
this
particular
location,
some
20
minutes
before
he
actually
went
to
work
when
the
truck
was
there.
when
he
first
came
there
to
do
the
work,
the
truck
wasn't
there.
when
he
came
back
20
minutes
later
to
do
this
particular
work,
the
truck
was
there
and
he
saw
it.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
yes.
but
he
had
eight
hours
within
which
to
do
it,
sir.
and
he
could've
picked
a
spot
anywhere
in
the
yard.
he
chose
of
his
volition,
this
particular
spot
if
this
--
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
yes,
sir.
but
our
courts
and
this
honorable
court
have
held
that
that
diminished
--
diminishing
issue
is,
in
itself,
a
general
issue.
and
we
have
cited
cases
in
our
brief.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
what
the
jury
considered,
if
your
honor
please,
i
don't
know.
i
do
know
this,
that
only
a
general
issue
such
as
safe
place
to
work,
it's
very
reasonable
that
a
jury
of
12
men
would
say
while
its
bound
up
to
being
safe
for
he
would
have
been
--
he
would
not
have
been
injured
without
knowing
specifically
why
it
was
not
safe.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
that's
very
true,
sir.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
yes,
sir.
but
they're
not
in
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
l.
cobb
on
that,
mr.
associate
--
associate
justice,
i
would
answer
it
