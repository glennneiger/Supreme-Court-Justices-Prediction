justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
this
--
is
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
photographed
at
288a
of
the
record?
does
this
show
the
condition
just
before
the
injury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
--
is
that
the
roadway
looking
at
the
bottom
picture
now
between
the
railroad
car
and
what
looks
--
this
other
gutter
to
the
left?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
a
gutter
to
the
left?
did
you
look
at
the
picture
or
at
least
--
does
the
roadway
fall
away
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
park,
you
said?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
this
--
what
is
it
--
what
is
it,
that's
like
a
curving
or
something
along
the
edge
of
the
road?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
was
the
petitioner
working
in
these
cars
or
cars
like
them
on
the
side?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
inspection
was
interior
or
exterior
or
both?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
--
and
was
the
truck
in
somewhat
the
position
shown
in
the
photograph
backing
out,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
--
do
i
understand
that
one
of
the
grounds
of
negligence
was
that
the
narrowness
of
that
roadway
didn't
leave
room
enough
for
both
the
truck
and
the
employee?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
while
at
work
the
railroad
being
responsible
for
the
narrowness
of
the
roadway
and
so
forth,
the
fact
into
the
employee
and
that
was
a
proximate
cause?
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
was
the
jury
finding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
that
sense
because
it
was
too
narrow,
was
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
to
stay
out
on
that
narrow
roadway
and
not
to
go
on
the
grass,
was
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
your
point
is
that
so
the
jury
found
in
any
event.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
jury
diminished
the
--
suppose
that
30,000
may
diminish
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
it
by
18
or
something
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
what
--
what
were
the
specifics
as
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
which
the
railroad
was
exonerated?
were
those
in
relation
to
the
fact
that
billings
drove
the
truck
that
the
truck
was
there
and
that
barely
give
warning
in
that
kind
of
thing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
dealt
with
the
operation
of
the
truck.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
presence
of
the
truck.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
all
related
to
the
truck.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
with
the
truck.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
--
which
one
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
which
is
the
one
as
to
the
area?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
number?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
number
7
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
number
7
relates
to
the
truck
being
--
being
driven
on
the
area.
where
--
where
--
is
there
anything
except
as
one
or
two
does
or
doesn't
embrace
it
which
dears
--
deals
with
the
widths
of
that
area
and
having
the
employee
work
there.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
well,
that
--
that
again
as
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
i
thought
he
was
telling
me
earlier
that
these
all
relate
to
the
presence
of
the
truck
and
the
operation
of
the
truck.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
truck
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it's
the
trucks
on
the
evidence,
doesn't
number
7
deal
with
permitting
the
motor
trucks
to
be
driven
on
an
area?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
where
--
is
there
a
finding
that
relates
specifically
to
having
this
employee
work
on
a
narrow
area,
not
wide
enough
both
for
him
and
the
truck.
where
--
is
there
any
specific
finding
related
to
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
tell
us
that
that
is
--
that's
a
finding
related
to
the
narrowness
of
the
area
and
of
having
petitioner
work
on
that
narrow
area
at
the
same
time
a
truck
was
there,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
notwithstanding
--
notwithstanding
the
finding
in
number
1
as
to
number
1
that
there
was
a
failure
to
furnish
the
plaintiff
with
a
reasonably
safe
place
to
work
and
was
at
number
3
that
that
failure
was
a
proximate
cause
to
the
injury.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
why
--
why
would
not
this
whole
verdict
sum
up
to
something
like
this,
that
no,
it
wasn't
negligent
to
have
the
truck
on
the
driveway.
no,
the
operation
of
the
truck
in
backing
up
was
not
negligence.
no,
it
wasn't
negligent
not
to
have
a
lookout,
to
warn
the
petitioner.
but,
to
have
the
truck
on
a
narrow
driveway
and
order
the
petitioner
to
work
in
that
circumstance
was
to
provide
the
petitioner
with
an
unsafe
place
to
work.
why
isn't
that
exactly
what
the
jury
held?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
was
a
--
this
--
this
certainly
was
in
the
evidence,
if
i
read
it
correctly,
that
this
was
a
narrow
10
foot
8
inch
driveway,
that
there
was
a
truck
on
it,
unloading
nail
or
loading
nail
as
the
case
maybe
from
the
car,
that
this
petitioner
was
ordered
to
work
and
required
to
work
where
he
did.
i
think
there
was
some
testimony
that
well
he
could've
worked
elsewhere
if
he
wanted
to.
but
the
fact
is
this
was
part
of
the
work
that
he
was
assigned
to
do,
whatever
it
was
in
relation
to
those
railroad
cars,
isn't
that
right?
all
of
that
is
in
the
evidence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
all
that
being
in
the
evidence,
the
fact
is
that
in
that
special
fact
circumstance,
in
that
place
where
there
wasn't
room
to
stand
as
the
evidence
says,
i
think,
on
either
side
of
the
truck
and
do
the
work
that
he
was
doing,
he
was
injured.
now,
all
that
was
in
the
evidence,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
why
wasn't
that
what
the
jury's
finding
that
he
was
required
to
work
in
an
unsafe
place
and
there
wasn't
affirmative
finding
to
that
effect,
why
isn't
that
what
they
held?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
of
course,
rogers
hold
that
if,
in
any
part,
however
slight,
there
was
a
causal
connection
between
negligence
established
and
the
injury.
was
the
jury
question
and
the
jury
verdict
based
it
upon
a
finding
that
there
was
a
causal
connection,
however
slight,
justifies
the
verdict,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
why
--
the
jury
did
find
that
if
this
was
an
unsafe
place
to
work,
and
they
found
that
it
was,
that
there
was
a
causal
connection,
isn't
that
finding
number
2
or
number
1,
i've
got
which
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
number
1
that
there
was
a
causal
connection.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
they
said
it
was
a
proximate
cause.
but
then
why
wasn't
the
test
to
rogers
satisfied
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
of
course,
these
rights
under
the
statute
of
federal
rights
in
that
statements?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
don't
suppose
any
peculiarities
that
state
practice
can
deny
when
entitled
to
rights
under
the
statute
that
two
of
those
rights,
can
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
maybe
true,
but
i
--
i
fail
to
see
whether
any
of
these
specifics
submitted
included
whether
it
was
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
railroad
to
have
required
him
to
work
in
--
on
that
narrow
roadway,
whatever
it
was,
while
a
truck
just
took
up
most
of
the
roadway.
was
there
loading
and
unloading
and
having
to
lead
the
roadway
and
the
matter
it
did
to
back
up.
that
wasn't
submitted
specifically,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
if
on
the
specifics
on
which
the
jury
found
for
the
railroad,
that
was
not
included.
are
you
telling
us
that,
nevertheless,
the
one
and
two
findings
are
destroyed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
all
--
all
that
was
submitted
in
number
7
was
whether
it
was
negligent
to
permit
motor
trucks
to
be
driven
on
the
area.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
does
that
to
be
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
does
that
reach
whether
it
was
negligent
to
require
the
petitioner,
the
work
in
that
area
while
the
truck
was
on
the
area?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
he
wasn't
working
for
his
own
benefit.
he
was
working
for
the
railroad,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
was
--
and
what
he
was
doing
was
in
furtherance
of
his
employer's
business,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
work
was
part
of
his
assigned
work
whether
he
was
at
liberty
to
pick
his
time
for
doing
it
or
not.
he
had
to
get
it
done,
didn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
didn't
the
jury
find
him
guilty
of
contributory
negligence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
diminish
this
--
the
award
on
that
account?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
no.
my
point
is
the
fact
that
he
chose
to
work
there
after
he
saw
the
truck
was
there
was
considered,
don't
you
suppose,
where
the
jury
and
his
determination
that
he
was
guilty
of
contributory
negligence?
