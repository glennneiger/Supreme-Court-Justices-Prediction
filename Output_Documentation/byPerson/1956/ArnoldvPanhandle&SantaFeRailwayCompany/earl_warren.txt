chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
the
driver
man
of
that
sentence,
though,
the
points
you
have
read
or
the
point
that
was
on
a
10
foot,
8
inch
gravel
driveway.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he
doesn't
charge
because
it
was
negligent
of
the
--
negligence
of
the
driver
there.
he
says
that
with
reference
to
respondent's
--
respondent's
duty
to
furnish
petitioner
a
reasonably
safe
place
to
work,
the
evidence
showed
that
petitioner
was
struck
by
a
truck
which
was
backing
up
on
a
10
foot
8
inch
gravel
driveway
running
adjacent
to
respondent's
railroad
trucks
on
which
were
situated
three
cars.
now,
you
turn
that
into
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
into
a
situation
where
the
jury
found
that
the
driver
wasn't
negligent.
this
says
that
the
respondent,
what
--
or
permitted
that
--
that
place
to
be
constructed
in
that
way
and
use
them
that
way
which
the
jury
found
to
be
an
unsafe
place
to
work.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
the
others
are
rather
specific
too,
isn't
it,
where
they
hold
that
it's
an
unsafe
place
to
work?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
i
suppose
negligence
could
take
in
the
good,
many
things
too,
couldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
bean?
