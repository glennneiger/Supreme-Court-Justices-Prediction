mr.
horsky
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course
you
--
you
don't
have
to
take
on
more
than
is
necessary
and
you
naturally
say
you
accept
mackenzie
and
--
and
go
off
from
there
and
this
isn't
mackenzie,
i
understand
that.
but
the
logic
of
it,
i
mean
reasonably
and
rationally,
if
congress
may
say
that
whenever
an
american
woman
marries
a
foreigner
that
involved
international
complications,
and
therefore,
the
citizenship
may
be
terminated.
i
find
it
very
difficult
for
us
to
sit
here
in
judgment
on
congress
in
determining
that
a
person
who
throws
in
his
lot
with
a
political
society
of
another
nation
may
not
equally
well
complicate
foreign
relationship.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
being
outside
of
this
country
forever
and
not
responding
to
the
call
of
this
country,
to
serve
this
country
in
time
of
war
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
get
into
the
realm
of
sitting
in
judgment
on
what
congress
conceived
to
be
the
consequences
of
such
a
relationship.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
automatically
--
to
say
automatically
that
every
american-
born
wife
maybe
get
international
complications
with
a
non-american
husband,
there's
a
long
draft
on
my
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
acceptance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
consciously
troubled,
mr.
horsky,
when
i'm
told
by
counsel
that
something
as
pretty
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
that's
quite
accurate
because
mr.
justice
mckenna
himself
recognized
the
great
change
taking
place
in
the
conception
of
the
law
towards
women.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
as
i
said
in
my
opening,
you
have
a
right
to
say
you
don't
--
you
accept
that,
nevertheless,
this
is
different.
i'm
suggesting
that
the
difference
is
not
really
irrationally
definable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
she
got
a
divorce.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
it
is.
he
could
become
naturalized.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean
he
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
contingencies
of
a
woman's
husband
dying
and
getting
a
divorce,
perhaps
the
contingencies
are
much
more
probable
in
--
it's
more
mathematically
likely
in
1957
than
in
1915
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down,
i'd
like
to
put
one
question
to
you
and
perhaps
mr.
davis
will
deal
with
it
when
he
rises
to
state
his
case.
i
--
you
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
but
i
only
very
quickly
leap
to
your
brief
and
do
not
find
--
and
find
that
your
position
is,
as
you've
argued
it,
that
such
legislation
is
unconstitutional.
you
do
not
rest
it
on
the
mode
by
which
that
status
is
lost,
namely,
the
administrative
process
rather
than
the
judicial
process,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand
that.
but
to
be
very
specific,
you
must
have
some
very
good
reason
why
you
do
not
urge
upon
the
court.
not
that
you're
not
free
to
ask.
i
put
my
question
that
you
don't
think
--
draw
upon
the
(inaudible)
that
a
judicial
inquiry
is
necessary
even
in
the
case
of
a
conceded
alien
or
confessedly
or
complained
about
alien
who
insist
upon
his
citizenship.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
--
but
as
i
understand
they
may
misconceive
a
case.
as
i
understand
it,
he
was
kept
out
in
the
way
any
alien
is
kept
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
you
mean
--
but
he
--
he
is
now
to
be
deported.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
the
deportation
proceeding
--
therefore,
he
is
subject
to
the
deportation
proceeding.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
may
have
a
judicial
review
of
the
claim
that
he's
a
citizen.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
before
a
judge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
want
to
know
is
whether
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
before
he
came,
this
--
we
have
to
deal
with
the
statute
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
this
is
an
incoming
person
who
asks
to
come
in
and
the
board
of
--
and
the
immigration
service
going
up
to
the
board
of
appeals
says,
“oh,
no,
you're
not
an
american
citizen.”
under
this
statute,
can
he
go
into
a
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
in
construing
the
statute,
i
have
to
consider
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
kind
of
a
review,
de
novo?
justice
felix
frankfurter
de
novo.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
so
that
the
question
then
is
narrower
whether
even
judicially
if
he's
in
the
country,
his
citizenship
may
be
found
not
to
exist
any
longer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
the
other
case
we
have
before
us?
have
we
in
the
other
cases,
an
incoming
alien?
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
the
government
would
say
that
he
would
or
wouldn't
or
maybe
that's
a
hypothetical
case
but
this
is
one
statute.
it
doesn't
deal
merely
with
people
who
are
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
had
lost
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
don't
know
how
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
maybe
he
couldn't
construe
it
distributively,
assuming
it
would
sustain
constitutionally
and
then
add
on
that
mode
of
procedure
to
an
incoming
american
citizen
who
was
stopped
by
being
told
he
has
forfeited
his
citizenship.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand
already.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
they
all
deportations,
mr.
davis?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
next
case
will
raise
my
--
my
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
but
it
is
exclusion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
the
part
of
the
(inaudible)
business?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
more
satisfied
on
that
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
as
a
matter
of
curiosity,
what
led
to
that
inquiry
by
president
grant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
were
written
answers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
this
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
on
house?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you?
did
you
say
he
was
treated
together
as
in
separately?
you
stated
conjunctively
in
your
statement
of
the
facts.
i
would
like
to
ask
you
whether
either
one
may
regard
this
case
as
a
finding
both
under
(e)
and
(j)
and
whether
if
they're
to
be
taken
collectively
and
not
disjunctive,
does
that
makes
any
difference
in
your
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
my
question
has
an
implication
that
one
alone
may
not
be,
but
two
together
may.
that's
the
point
on
my
side.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wouldn't
put
it
that
way.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
way
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
can
--
i
--
i
appreciate
that
argument.
but
suppose
i
asked
two
questions.
one,
can
the
statute,
in
your
case,
be
construed
that
if
he
disqualifies
himself,
if
i
may
use
a
neutral
term,
both
under
(e)
and
(g)
not
one
alone
but
the
two
together,
will
that
make
a
difference?
and
two,
may
the
statute
be
read
at
least
as
applied
to
this
case
that
you
have
both
disqualification
present.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(e)
and
(j).
i'm
talking
about
(e)
and
(j).
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
congress
said
a
man
shall
lose
his
citizenship
if
he
has
done
what
he
says
disqualified
if
he
--
what
they
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
sorry
that
i
have
put
to
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
cannot
be
construed
for
your
--
for
the
purposes
of
your
case
so
as
to
require
both
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
can't
be,
then
--
then
my
question
--
that's
the
shortest
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
wouldn't
want
us
to
determine
constitutionality
on
bearing
views
about
what
is
voluntary
and
what
is
not
voluntary
in
one's
action.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
italy
or
some
other
country,
italy
particularly
attracted
to
americans,
there's
a
--
you
can
become
an
italian
citizen
and
by
becoming
so,
as
an
american,
you
merely
may
enjoy
the
advantages
of
italian
citizenship
and
none
of
its
obligations.
was
that
a
dilution
or
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
person
then
signed
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
document
the
way
the
lady
did
in
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
she
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
in
the
sense
as
i
define
it
in
italian
hypothetical
legislation,
namely,
he
can
get
all
the
benefit.
he
can
get
a
passport
from
the
italian
foreign
office
if
it's
sometimes
too
difficult
to
get
it
from
the
cooperative
state
etcetera,
etcetera.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can
get
the
benefit
of
taxation
that
those
--
like
a
taxation
for
italian
citizens
or
heavier
rather
against
foreign
citizen.
i
know,
maybe
that's
a
crazy
hypothesis
and
i'm
not
putting
a
test
to
the
constitutionality
on
crazy
hypotheses
but
i'm
suggesting
that
the
word
“voluntary”
and
“involuntary”
is
not
a
very
helpful
distinction
made
as
you've
made
it,
namely,
she
wouldn't
be
allowed
to
contradict
that
it's
voluntary.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
move
on
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
mean
that
if
a
man
commits
what
is
called
treason
that
automatically,
he
loses
his
citizenship
although
a
statute
may
not
have
--
you
said
that
that
was
a
consequence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
--
i'm
assuming
there's
no
outlawry
of
the
treason
--
treason.
and
there's
no
punishment
indicated.
does
that
mean
that
the
sentence
you
read
is
one
thing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
what
about
treason?
justice
felix
frankfurter
congress
--
congress
cannot
say
a
man
who
committed
what
could
be
criminally
pursued
as
treason
not
make
that
an
offense
but
simply
say
we
don't
want
it.
we
take
the
citizenship
away?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
assuming
no
conviction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
my
question
doesn't
necessarily
mean
by
legislative
fiat.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
you
can
always
go
into
court
and
say
i
didn't
commit
treason
and
the
occasion
is
either
--
said
i
did
acted
arbitrarily
etcetera.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
a
bill
of
attainder.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
talking
about
something
else.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
--
do
you
say
that
that
couldn't
be
done.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
question
i
put
to
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
horsky,
did
you
say
that
it
had
been
held
that
if
a
fellow
happened
to
be
a
resident
to
--
at
(inaudible)
during
the
summer
and
they
have
an
election
whether
this
is
--
this
town
should
be
--
if
it
is
a
town,
should
be
dry
or
wet.
that
town
is
--
has
been
held
to
cover
the
need?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
--
are
these
administrative
determinations?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
horsky,
can
you
shed
any
light
up
to
the
second
part
of
(e)
or
of
plebiscite
to
determine
the
sovereignty
over
foreign
territory?
justice
felix
frankfurter
sort
of
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
horsky,
when
you
said
congress
was
unhappy
about
american
voting
for
the
determination
of
(inaudible)
in
which
you
told
germany
or
france,
what
was
the
--
why
were
they
--
why
should
they
--
why
were
they
unhappy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
think
of
a
good
reason
why
they
might
be,
couldn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
some
--
some
of
them
are
obvious.
one
of
them,
it
seems
obvious.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
certainly
pertains
to
good
foreign
relations,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
implication
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
implication
of
your
answer,
as
i
get
it,
at
least
it
strikes
my
mind,
is
that
the
difficulty
of
with
what
you
put
is
as
conceivably
as
not
that
--
do
not
--
within
the
range
of
power
or
the
exercise
of
it
would
offend
the
due
process
clause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
--
what
real
difference
is
there
between
an
american
woman
who
(inaudible)
american
business,
what
real
difference
is
there
between
--
on
the
score
of
voluntariness
and
involuntariness
between
a
woman
becoming
the
wife
of
an
italian
or
an
english
or
french
gentleman
or
a
(inaudible)
gentleman,
and
the
law
say
--
the
congress
say
the
consequence
is
that
you'll
lose
your
american
citizenship
although
she
would
like
to
retain
and
she
doesn't
want
to
give
it
up
so
far
as
the
ruling
goes,
and
a
man
saying,
“i'm
sufficiently
concerned
with
the
(inaudible)
with
france
if
you'd
go
to
germany
but
i'm
going
to
vote
in
this
election
and
i
don't
care
what
congress
has
to
do
in
contrary.”
what
difference
in
--
on
the
score
of
voluntariness?
both
of
them
--
the
real
question
is
whether
congress
may
attach
certain
consequences
to
acts
which
are
consciously
undertaken.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
the
lady
would
know
less
what
her
international
state
is
as
indeed
when
the
case
--
the
italian
case
we've
had.
all
she
wanted
is
to
marry
that
charming
gentleman.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
finding
was
the
other
way.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
because
it
said
it's
immaterial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
think
that
even
intelligent,
contemplated
woman
really
knows
the
status
under
international
law
when
books
are
written
about
it
showing
the
difficulties
of
ascertaining?
justice
felix
frankfurter
she
may
want
to
have
both.
justice
felix
frankfurter
dual
citizenship
is
nothing
strange
or
unbelievable
in
this
world.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
happens
every
day.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down,
mr.
horsky,
may
i
ask
you
trouble
you
for
a
reference
of
the
--
justice

--
the
attorney
general's
opinion?
i
don't
find
it
in
your

do
i
--
justice

the
reference.
you
said
the
attorney
general
had
ruled
in
voting
for
--
on
idea
of
plebiscite.
justice

is
it
in
there?
justice
felix

which
one
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
page?
justice

white

justice

the
matter
of

justice

is
that
where
i
find
--
the
opinion
is
not
reported
in
the
opinion
of
the

justice

it's
a

of

justice

i
--
i
look
from

justice

(voice

--
justice

--
the
opinions
of
the
attorney

i
couldn't
find
it.
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
didn't
you
--
may
i
say
that
you
think
that's
important
than
--
is
it
a
right
inference
that
in
each
case,
you
have
to
ascertain
what
the
laws
of
nationality
are
of
alien
parents
with
a
child
that's
born
in
this
country?
justice

no,
no.
but
it's
a
relevant
factor
(voice

--
justice

i
was
going
to
ask
you
about
that,
mr.

because
i
must
say
i've
got
a
quite
(inaudible)
when
mr.
horsky
stated
that
case
that
a
sizeable
(inaudible)
when
he
said
that
the
attorney
general
--
i
understood
him
evidently,
erroneously
because
i've
said
that
the
report
is
now
ready.
he
indicated
that
this
was
an
opinion
of
the
attorney
general.
as
i
--
we
did
the
case
of
(inaudible)
is
a
very
different
thing.
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
on
its
own
reasoning
as
well
as
on
the
advice
or
rather
on
the
opinion
expressed
by
the
legal
adviser
of
the
state
department
is
that
that
was
not

determine
the
statute.
that
was
not
a
political,
what
is
the
phrase?

felix
frankfurter
political
election.
it
then
went
up
to
the
attorney
--
the
then
attorney
general,
it
could
have
gone
to
anybody
else
but
it
was
presented
to
the
attorney
general,
and
he
said
that
that's
a
very
doubtful
question
and
he
thought
it
ought
to
be
passed
upon
by
the
court
and
so
he
felt
--
i
feel
that
a
judicial
decision
thereon
is
desirable
and
so
he
reversed
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
of
course,
so
that
the
matter
could
then
be
taken
to
the
court
and
have
the
court's
decision.
i
should
have
been
--
i
--
i
was
shocked
that
it
thought
the
attorney
general
had
ruled,
as
a
matter
of
law,
as
a
general
ruling,
he's
deciding
between
beer
and
wine
or
whether
beer
and/or
wine,
there's
a
political
(inaudible)
evidently.
in
this
particular
case,
he
thought
this
was
a
good
thing
for
(inaudible)
take
the
court
to
decide
would
somewhat
release
my
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
attorney
--
the
--
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
so
decided,
the
assistant
secretary
of
state
in
charge
with
the
matter
was
no
mean
lawyer
himself
and
the
legal
adviser,
all
decided
it
wasn't.
and
the
attorney
general
had
said
nothing
about
it
and
he
thought
that
this
particular
case
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i'm
in
the
opposite.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
he
stated
--
it
might
have
given
us
the
--
the
advantage
the
other
way
around
but
evidently,
he
want
to
get
a
ruling
from
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor,
i'd
like
to
put
to
you
this
problem.
suppose
one
went
with
you
all
the
way
on
your
analysis
of
the
power
of
congress
and
reached
the
limitation
that
you
recognize,
namely,
that
--
as
was
said
in
reynolds
case,
even
war
power
is
limited
by
the
due
process
clause
and
we
get
on
to
the
due
process
clause.
what
i
want
to
put
to
you
to
answer
either
in
the
time
you
now
have
or
in
the
time
that
you
have
in
the
other
cases
is
this.
this
court
held
in
(inaudible)
that
while
the
issue
of
citizenship,
if
a
man
comes
in
the
harbor
of
new
york
and
he
claims
he
is
a
citizen
to
avoid
special
inquiry
in
the
appeal
board,
in
the
attorney
general's
findings
of
fact
or
otherwise,
we
cannot
have
a
jury
trial
for
that
issue
on
citizenship.
but
if
he
is
to
be
deported
from
this
country,
then
for
the
reasons
given
in
that
opinion,
namely,
the
advantages
and
the
protection
from
the
safeguards
of
jury
as
against
the
administrative
process
not
making
any
aversion
against
administrative
process
except
its
adaptability
from
the
securities
that
it
does
and
doesn't
at
all.
when
it
comes
to
deportation,
the
issue
of
citizenship
must
be
one
to
which
court
--
judicial
determination,
not
jury
but
judicial
determination
as
directed.
i
want
to
put
to
you
this,
whether
that
kind
of
reasoning
and
considerations
have
led
to
that
decision
(inaudible)
of
our
constitutional
law,
isn't
applicable
on
the
way
of
the
differences.
but
as
you
--
it
has
an
analogous
application
to
the
deprivation
of
citizenship.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
issue
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
the
first
instance
is
one
for
judicial
determination,
not
for
administrative
determination
subject
to
reviewing
the
courts
for
the
--
within
that
narrow
limit
that
the
administrative
exceeded
the
speed
limit.
did
i
put
the
question
clear?
yes,
sir.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
let
you
say
here,
isn't
it?
and
they
do
a
redundance
in
saying
and
that's
part
of
reality
so
that
in
answer
to
my
question
why
shouldn't
this
have
the
procedure
that
was
constitutionally
required
in
being
controlled
you
could
see
now,
you
say
the
answer
is
the
judge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
does
that
mean
to
say
that
constitutionally
will
offend
--
if
congress
outlaws
conduct
to
be
defined
by
not
loading
so
many
months
and
not
loading
so
many
dollars,
that
that
require
a
jury
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
whole
realm
of
petty
offense
and
he's
out
of
the
jury
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
take
a
minute
of
your
time
or
of
our
time.
in
this
case,
the
issue
arose
because
he
was
sought
to
be
deported
as
an
alien,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
sought
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
not
to
let
him
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
he
was
an
alien.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
the
--
he
then
put
a
--
he
put
an
issue
to
the
fact
that
he
was
a
citizen.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
court
decided
against
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
would
like
to
know
is
whether
you
think
the
procedure
that
was
just
followed
here,
satisfy
and
--
and
exhaust
503
or
could
he
have
brought
an
independent
proceeding
or
could
he
now
(inaudible)
putting
that
to
one
side
for
the
moment,
could
he
now
bring
an
independent
proceeding
to
have
that
issue
determined
on
the
basis
of
my
question
which
was
tied
to
the
deportation
case
of
citizenship
which
requires
merely
a
judicial
proceeding
and
not
a
jury
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
despite
these
things
or
--
or
this
may
--
you
--
he
may
have
been
said
to
have
had
the
kind
of
a
judicial
proceeding
that
this
court
in
(inaudible)
said
an
issue
of
citizenship,
where
is
this?
i
don't
know
which
but
i
haven't
realize,
i
should
have
that
--
i
hadn't
realized
your
section
503
which
whatever
else
--
whatever
have
consideration
of
due
process
may
raised,
i
think
comes
within
the
scope
and
satisfy
the
scope
that
analogy
of
the
--
of
the
deportation
case
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
that
--
of
what
was
laid
down
doesn't
touch
the
jury
thing
because
no
jury
requirement
was
made.
i
hope
you
can
get
the
impression
i'm
not
--
taking
away
citizenship
is
a
petty
matter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
meant
that
if
congress
made
an
offense
punishable
by
not
more
than
a
short
period,
and
what
is
short,
nobody
in
court
has
direct
sense
or
how
much
money
is
petty,
but
then
it
isn't
within
the
restriction
of
the
requirements
of
the
bill
of
rights.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
the
limits
are,
nobody
knows,
the
amount
in
the
quantity
punishment,
the
stigma,
in
other
--
other
words
the
problem
is
a
very
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
appear
what
kind
of
an
election
it
was?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wasn't
here,
though.
it
wasn't
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
didn't
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
you
didn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
at
all.
you
couldn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
i
--
i'm
sorry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
i
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
couldn't.
it
could
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
except
through
my
hearing
of
not
understanding
what
you
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i
(voice
overlap)
--
with
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
did
say
this
is
a
way
of
getting
a
ruling
from
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
he
said
it's
undecided
and
i
don't
know.
it's
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
me
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it's
illustration
of
the
excessive
burdens
on
an
attorney
general
attack
on
a
case
like
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
have
controversies
as
to
when
it
does
and
when
it
doesn't.
