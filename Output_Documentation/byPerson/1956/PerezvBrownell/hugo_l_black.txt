justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
state
in
your
brief
what
the
conditions
thereof
or
what
is
the
scope
of
the
sovereign
power
to
take
away
citizenship?
well,
what
--
where
would
the
limit
be?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
larceny?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
refusing
to
answer
questions
relating
to
foreign
affairs?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
judge
it
from
your
argument
i
thought.
i'm
not
saying
it's
wrong.
i'm
not
saying
it's
right.
i
don't
know.
that
what
you
are
saying,
in
effect
is,
that
so
long
as
an
act
of
congress,
which
takes
away
citizenship,
has
--
has
some
kind
of
rational
basis
to
support
it,
the
court
should
let
it
alone
even
though
it's
to
be
taken
away
without
a
trial
by
jury
in
a
court
procedure.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i'm
taking
about
a
trial
by
jury
indictment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
simply
asking
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
i
do
know,
mr.
justice
clark,
is
that
mr.
flournoy,
the
assistant
legal
adviser
of
the
state
department,
who
was
a
great
expert
in
this
field,
wrote
an
article
in
the
encyclopedia
of
social
sciences
in
1931,
which
is
before
the
passage
of
the
1940
act
on
--
on
the
subject
of
expatriation.
and
in
the
course
of
that
article
he
said,
"the
laws
of
various
states
in
that
country,
his
foreign
country,
contain
provisions
under
which
nationality
is
lost
by
act
other
than
voluntary
naturalization
in
foreign
countries.
among
these
may
be
mentioned,
permanent
departure
from
the
country,
residence
abroad
for
a
specified
period,
failure
to
return
in
war,
evasion
of
military
service,
acceptance
of
decorations
conferred
by
foreign
countries,
marriage
of
a
woman
national
as
to
an
alien."
so
i
think
i
have
not
made
a
thorough
survey
but
on
the
basis
of
that,
there
have
been
in
the
past
and
there
are
still
today.
i
think
statutes
of
this
type
on
the
books
of
the
countries.
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
is
that
(inaudible)
the
court's
finding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what's
(inaudible)
in
argument
you're
making
now,
there's
a
point
of
law
raised,
the
constitutionality
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
by
that
that
congress
is
reasonably
--
i
don't
quite
agree
(inaudible)
but
do
you
think
by
that
that
congress
is
reasonable
to
say
that
every
man
can
go
to
other
country
on
each
circumstances
or
(inaudible)
shows
his
loyalty
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
merely
means
that
many
of
them
would
show
his
loyalty
by
the
way
in
which
they
vote
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
that's
true,
the
thing
that
bothers
me
is
why
there's
a
consequence
with
reference
to
the
basic
things
that
brings
about
his
disloyalty
or
it
brings
about
the
loss
of
citizenship.
if
it
is
to
be
decided
on
the
facts,
cases
and
controversies,
why
should
we
have
a
right
to
trial
under
this
method
of
trial
by
the
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
rankin,
why
do
you
say
that
the
congressional
power
might
be
limited
by
the
eighth
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
over
these
cases.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
is
that
--
is
that
the
reason
you
said
that
you
consider
it
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
think
they'll
take
the
citizenship
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
that's
the
reason,
then
anybody
who
should
sought
to
leave
this
country,
should
lose
his
citizenship
(inaudible)
problem,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
the
eighth
amendment,
in
your
judgment,
has
nothing
to
do
with
if
congress
is
not
limited
of
its
power
to
(inaudible)
eighth
amendment
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
--
if
they
did
on
some
ground
that
it's
reasonable
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
go
to
the
judgment
of
congress
and
then
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
evidently
would
turn
obviously
on
what
the
judge
has
imposed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
that's
the
case,
here,
you
say
you
have
to
look
not
to
what
authorize
the
constitution
expect
(inaudible)
it's
rather
a
vague
power,
i
suppose.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
assume
that
those
who
(inaudible)
giving
those
power
and
they
send
them
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
rather
glad
you
came
back
to
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
it
has
to
decide
for
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
rights
does
he
have?
justice
hugo
l.
black
before
whom?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
all
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
that
would
supply
all
the
former
cases
if
you
have
the
--
protect
--
the
procedural
protection
to
which
that
case
has
indicated
that
citizens
should
have?
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
judgment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice
overlap)
when
a
man
is
being
deprived
of
something
to
get
a
case
--
i
suppose
a
case
of
controversy.
some
people
might
think
he
ought
to
have
a
jury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
depends
on
the
definition
of
due
process,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
they
were
to
try
him
for
violating
that
statute
which
makes
it
a
crime
to
go
abroad
if
he
--
so
in
this
--
it
wouldn't
be
due
process
to
try
it
without
a
jury
of
indictment
would
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
he
--
if
on
that
case,
that
they
charge
him
with
that,
he
would
â€“
he
could
be
fined
for
$500,
would
he
be
entitled
to
a
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
statute
in
the
section
makes
it
a
crime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
he
didn't
waive
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
line
between
those,
as
i
recall
it,
there
was
once
the
district
of
columbia
that
(inaudible)
has
been
indicated.
it
was
said
the
trial
that
many
people
might
think
we're
petty
but
entitle
them
to
use
them
in
fact.
i
forgot
the
name
it
was
written
by
as
far
as
i
recall
it
was
mr.
justice
harlan
and
many
years
ago.
what
are
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
want
to
consider
this
a
petty
offense
if
it
could
take
away
his
citizenship
as
a
punishment,
wouldn't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
some
question
about
why,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
--
if
your
adversary's
position
is
correct
that
the
law
--
the
constitution
forbids
(inaudible)
or
it
does
not
permit
the
constitution
to
take
away
citizenship
which
the
man
has
not
voluntarily
abandoned,
assuming
at
the
perez,
would
you
say
that
--
then
congress
could
classify
along
with
those
who
do
not
voluntarily
(inaudible)
those
who
do
by
defining
as
a
ground
to
forfeit
citizenship,
voting
in
a
foreign
country.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
question
i
was
asking
you
was
following
up
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
is
the
question
i'm
asking
that
is
there
not
also
an
additional
power
or
how
do
the
reference
to
this
legislative
power
in
this
respect
that
if
they
are
right,
your
adversaries
are
right,
saying
there
must
be
a
voluntary
or
using
the
word
to
be
deliberate,
intentional,
real
honest
to
goodness
abandonment
by
the
person,
before
congress
can
take
away
citizenship
except
maybe
for
a
crime.
if
that
be
the
case,
would
you
still
say
that
congress
could
classify
the
innocent
and
the
guilty
in
that
line
or
if
you
want
to
call
it
that
are
the
knowing
and
the
unknowing,
of
course,
they
lumped
and
only
in
one
group
and
say
the
conduct
which
might
be
either
could
be
used
to
forfeit
citizenship,
would
you
say
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
there
wouldn't
be
any
question
of
reasonableness
under
those
circumstances,
would
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
understand
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
assuming
something
if
you
rigorously
deny.
