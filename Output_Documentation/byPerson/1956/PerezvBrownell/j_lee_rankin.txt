mr.
j.
lee
rankin
may
it
please
the
court.
counsel
concedes
that
if
there
is
a
problem
of
dual
citizenship
or
allegiance
that
is
divided
between
several
countries,
he
can
recognize
a
need
for
the
type
of
action
that
congress
has
dealt
with
in
this
section
401.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
real
burden
of
the
arguments
in
these
cases
is
that
a
citizen
knows
owes
no
allegiance
to
any
country
regardless.
the
facts
that
we
have
to
deal
with
in
this
particular
case,
since
this
court
deals
with
cases
and
controversies,
should
be
looked
at
again
to
see
what
happened
here
with
regard
to
perez.
he
was
born
in
the
united
states
but
the
fact
show
that
both
of
his
parents
were
mexicans.
and
under
the
mexican
law
just
as
--
is
the
case
with
our
law,
he
was
a
citizen
of
mexico.
now,
whether
he
ever
did
anything
to
expatriate
himself
or
denationalize
himself
under
mexican
law
is
not
shown
in
this
record
and
there's
no
finding
in
regard
to
it.
and
there
is
no
specific
finding
that
he
is
a
dual
national.
there
is
no
question
about
that
law
and
there
is
a
specific
finding
that
he
was
born
of
mexican
parents,
both
father
and
mother
and
born
in
united
states
which
would
give
him
citizenship
under
the
laws
in
both
countries.
that
is
a
fact
to
be
dealt
with
in
this
case.
then
he
went
with
his
parents
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
don't
think
that's
conclusive
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
a
relevant
factor
because
of
the
problem
that
congress
has
been
trying
to
deal
with
since
1868
when
they
provided
that
a
person
--
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
could
expatriate
himself
as
to
a
foreign
country.
now,
you've
got
to
be
able
to
have
it
both
ways
and
congress
was
trying
to
deal
with
the
problem
that
all
of
us
in
this
country
are
immigrants
as
we
go
back
on
our
various
lines.
and
there
are
all
kinds
of
calls
upon
the
citizens
of
this
country
as
they
came
over
here
for
all
kinds
of
obligations
of
citizenship
to
the
countries
from
which
they
came.
and
we
had
the
various
obligations
that
we
imposed
upon
our
citizens
after
they
arrived
here
and
it
got
to
the
place
that
in
deal
--
dealing
with
those
problems
in
the
conduct
of
our
foreign
affairs,
there
would
be
demands
by
certain
countries,
germany
is
a
good
example
and
many
others,
in
which
they
call
upon
our
people
to
render
service
in
the
armed
forces.
and
of
course
the
war
of
1812
is
a
classic
example
of
where
the
british
wanted
these
various
persons
that
we
claim
are
our
citizens
to
serve
in
their
name,
proceed
to
take.
and
it
was
therefore
a
clash
between
the
two
sovereignties
that
was
constantly
produced
that
congress
was
trying
to
deal
with.
and
so
after
they
passed
the
statute
in
regard
to
desertion
and
draft
evasion
in
1865,
more
than
100
years
ago,
they
also
proceeded
in
1868
to
provide
that
any
american
citizen
could
determine
for
himself
that
he
want
to
get
read
of
any
other
nationality
that
he
had
and
proceed
to
do
so.
that
was
the
first
time
that
congress
recognized
that
the
citizen
should
have
that
power.
but
that
was
the
basic
thing
they
were
trying
to
deal
with
in
this
whole
area
was
the
problem
that
was
imposed
upon
our
government
by
dual
or
multiple
claims
of
citizenship
by
several
sovereign
powers.
so
here,
we
have
a
man
who's,
on
the
face
of
the
record,
was
the
citizen
of
both
countries.
now,
let's
see
where
his
allegiance
was.
he
was
born
in
1909.
1919
and
1920
sometime
between
those
two
dates,
he
went
to
mexico
with
his
parents.
did
he
come
back
here
to
get
this
valued
citizenship
all
of
the
opportunities
that
were
available
to
american
citizens?
he
lived
in
mexico
from
1919
or
1920
to
june
19th,
1952,
except
for
the
few
times
i'll
call
your
attention
to
that
he
came
back.
and
when
he
came
back,
did
he
say,
“i
am
an
american
citizen.
i'm
claiming
all
these
precious
rights,
and
i
also
want
to
perform
all
of
the
obligations
that
an
american
citizen
owes
his
country”?
he
did
not.
in
1932,
after
he
was
informed
that
he
was
born
in
texas,
he
married
a
mexican
national.
he
has
seven
children
by
that
wife.
the
record
--
so
far
as
the
record
goes,
they've
always
been
resident
of
mexico
along
with
his
wife.
in
1940,
he
knew
he
should
register
at
the
outbreak
of
world
war
ii
but
he
didn't.
he
didn't
want
allegiance
to
the
united
states,
enough
to
perform
any
obligation
with
that
character.
july
28,
1943,
he
applies
for
admission
to
the
united
states.
does
he
say
he
is
an
american
citizen,
value
any
of
his
rights?
no.
he
says
he
is
a
mexican,
stating
that
he
was
born
in
mexico.
now,
in
1928,
many
years
before
that,
he
was
informed
that
he
was
born
in
the
united
states,
and
he
was
admitted
in
july
28,
1943
for
a
temporary
period
in
the
united
states
on
the
statement
that
he
was
a
mexican
national
and
was
born
in
mexico
when
he
knew
the
fact
he
is
to
the
contrary.
then
in
march
1944,
he
returned
to
mexico.
he
doesn't
value
his
privilege
so
that
he
cares
to
stay
much
in
this
country.
in
april
1944,
he
again
applies
for
admission
as
a
mexican
alien.
he
never
says
a
word
about
being
an
american
man
and
is
admitted
temporarily.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
but
if
he
said
he
was
an
american
citizen,
he
wouldn't
have
even
to
do
that.
of
course,
he'd
had.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
--
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
he
was
getting
work
in
this
country.
i
presume
in
--
and
that
was
part
of
that
work
program.
but
he
didn't
say
he
was
american
citizen
at
any
time.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
he
could
have
gotten
back
into
the
united
states
any
time
by
being
an
american
citizen.
then
he
returned
to
mexico,
again,
in
november
1944.
he
admits
in
this
case
that
from
november
1944
to
july
1944,
he
remained
in
mexico
to
avoid
the
draft.
there's
no
question
about
that.
he
was
admitted
several
times.
in
july
of
1946,
he
voted
in
a
political
election
in
mexico.
no
question
about
that.
now,
in
view
of
that
history,
is
he
a
mexican
national
or
is
he
an
american
citizen?
what
is
he
trying
to
do?
time
after
time,
he
said
he's
a
mexican.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
the
court's
finding
was
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i'm
trying
to
point
up
the
facts,
mr.
justice,
to
show
what
is
involved
in
this
particular
case
and
then
i
want
to
deal
with
the
constitutional
question
of
what
congress
is
trying
to
handle
and
recognize
this
hand
in
this
area
with
regard
to
the
problem
of
dual
nationality
and
the
effect
it
has
on
our
foreign
relations
and
the
conflicts
that
its
--
that
is
--
the
congress
anticipates,
it
will
cause
in
the
conduct
of
our
foreign
affairs
and
that
that
is
the
reason
and
a
very
reasonable
reason
that
congress
makes
the
provisions
that
it
has
that
apply
in
this
particular
case.
now,
questions
were
asked
from
the
bench
as
to
why
in
the
history
of
this
provision
about
a
political
--
voting
in
a
political
election,
why
was
that
included
as
a
reason
for
a
person
losing
his
citizenship
and
there
was
a
committee
consisting
of
the
attorney
general
and
the
secretary
of
the
state,
secretary
of
labor
who
was
given
the
responsibility
by
this
government
back
in
1938,
a
number
of
years
ago,
to
try
to
ascertain
what
should
be
done
about
this
problem
of
expatriation
in
a
number
of
different
areas.
and
they
didn't
just
come
out
that
year
with
the
particular
recommendation
to
the
congress
but
they
instituted
a
series
of
studies
that
lasted
over
a
period
of
about
two
years.
and
then
they
presented
to
the
congress
which
acted
in
1940,
their
recommendations
about
a
series
of
these
various
provisions
that
should
be
included
to
take
care
of
this
fundamental
problem
as
it
had
originated
and
developed
in
the
conduct
of
our
foreign
affairs,
immigration
and
the
other
problems
that
the
government
had
had
to
deal
with.
and
this
is
what
they
say
about
a
political
election
and
they
told
the
congress
at
that
time
that
it's
part
of
the
history.
it
was
the
cabinet
committee
which
proposed
the
national
--
nationality
act
of
1940.
this
is
the
quotation,
"taking
an
active
part
in
the
political
affairs
of
a
foreign
state
by
voting
in
a
political
election
therein
is
believed
to
involve
a
political
attachment
and
practical
allegiance
thereto
which
is
inconsistent
with
continued
allegiance
to
the
united
states,
whether
or
not
the
person
in
question
has
or
acquires
the
nationality
of
the
foreign
state.
in
any
event,
it
is
not
believed
that
an
american
national
should
be
permitted
to
participate
in
the
political
affairs
of
a
foreign
state
and
at
the
same
time
retain
his
american
nationality.
the
two
facts
would
seem
to
be
inconsistent
with
each
other."
now,
that
was
what
this
administrative
department
said
after
a
careful
study
of
this
problem
as
they
had
been
dealing
with
over
a
period
of
years
in
the
conduct
of
the
government.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
i
would,
mr.
justice
--
chief
justice.
i
think
there's
the
further
problem
of
whether
or
not
the
draft
evasion,
in
itself,
is
an
action
that
the
congress
--
it's
a
reasonable
action
for
the
congress
to
provide
in
this
manner
for
a
loss
of
citizenship.
and
that
isn't
--
in
my
opinion,
that
isn't
the
same
case
as
the
mendoza-martinez
case
that
the
court
is
now
holding
and
hasn't
determine
about
whether
it
will
grant
certiorari.
but
i
think
we
do
get
down
before
i
get
through
at
trop
at
least
to
the
basic
problem
of
whether
or
not
there
is
a
constitutional
power
and
i
think
that
the
constitutional
power
question
is
quite
simple
but,
furthermore,
whether
the
exercise
of
the
power,
in
case
of
diversion
--
desertion
and
draft
evasion,
is
a
reasonable
exercise
of
that
power
even
if
you
don't
have
the
dual
nationality
problem.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
--
i
think
not,
mr.
chief
justice,
for
this
reason.
i
think
it's
dealing
with
a
case
or
controversy
theory
that
this
court
follows
that
here,
you
have
before
you,
the
--
what
seems
to
me
the
more
a
fortiori
case
where
you
have
dual
citizenship
problem
because
there,
according
to
the
whole
history
of
our
country,
the
--
the
congress
is
solving
something
fundamentally
dealing
with
the
clashes
between
sovereign
nations
and
it
must
be
dealt
with
in
order
for
our
country
to
be
able
to
handle
foreign
affairs.
and
therefore,
you
have
a
different
problem.
now,
i
think
that
--
that
you
have
that
kind
of
a
problem
in
trop,
anyway
as
we
deal
with
that
case
but
only
as
to
desertion.
because
there,
we
don't
have
a
question
of
dual
nationality,
we
have
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
--
it
is
a
reasonable
exercise
as
applied
to
the
principle
of
desertion.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
in
this
particular
case,
in
the
facts
that
you're
dealing
with
here
on
the
principle,
the
court
has
always
followed
that
this
deals
with
the
facts
in
a
particular
case
before
it,
whatever
they
are,
not
the
hypothetical
cases
that
might
be
propounded
to
it
that
here,
we
have
a
dual
national
problem
and
it's
more
--
very
nearly
comparable
to
me
to
the
mackenzie
against
hare
situation
and
the
savorgnan
case
in
regard
to
the
problem
of
whether
or
not
they
can
continue
to
have
the
allegiance
to
another
country
as
exemplified
so
clearly
in
this
case
and
be
--
be
able
to
enjoy
the
benefits
of
the
citizenship
in
united
states.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
must
address
itself
too
to
the
great
problem
and
the
great
issue
here.
is
citizenship
in
the
united
states
a
one-way
street
as
the
expression
goes?
or
are
there
obligations
as
well
as
privileges?
i
wouldn't
say
to
--
for
a
minute
to
this
court
that
american
citizenship
isn't
one
of
the
most
precious
things
in
the
world
to
every
one
of
us.
but
if
a
man
says,
“this
thing
that's
so
precious
to
me,
the
idea
of
being
an
american
citizen,
being
able
to
call
upon
my
country
when
i
go
into
various
places
throughout
the
world,
to
protect
me
diplomatically
and
otherwise
in
my
various
activities,”
and
in
the
same
breath
say,
“i
won't
fight
to
protect
the
life
of
that
country.
i
will
go
out
of
that
country
and
live
for
the
whole
term
of
the
war
and
stay
there
so
i
can't
be
prosecuted,”
and
you'll
recall
that
you
can
be
prosecuted
several
times
after
you
served
once
for
evading
the
draft.
if
your
number
comes
up
again,
you
can
be
called
up
again
with
the
idea
that
that
way
the
person
might
repent
and
serve
his
country
yet
before
the
war
is
over.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
he
is.
there's
a
--
there
is
a
further
problem
though
that
the
foreign
country,
even
as
to
aliens
gets
in
to
the
act
because
it
has
obligations
just
as
we
recognize
obligations
to
aliens
and
if
a
man
is
obtaining
sanctuary
in
a
foreign
country,
its
entirely
different
problem
with
regard
to
our
foreign
relations
than
if
he
stays
in
our
country
and
we
just
aren't
able
to
find
him.
now,
congress,
it
seems
to
me,
could
very
well
decide
that
in
the
other
case,
a
man
who
rejects
this
fundamental
basic
obligation
of
citizenship
and
won't
even
fight
to
protect
this
thing
that
he
says
is
so
precious
to
him
more
than
anything
else
could
also
be
classified
or
included
but
this
court
has
held
because
congress
doesn't
include
everything
in
a
particular
statute,
it
doesn't
make
it
invalid
that
it
can
deal
with
a
part
and
still
be
a
constitutional
action
by
the
congress.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
--
the
immigration
laws
at
the
present
time
don't
provide
for
such
a
thing.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
would
want
to
tell
this
court
that
they
could,
yes.
i
think
that
if
congress
sees
fit
to
take
that
type
of
action
as
to
--
i
think
there
is
a
difference
between
a
man
who
does
not
carry
out
his
obligation
of
citizenship
and
continues
to
stay
in
the
country
and
a
man
who
fails
to
carry
out
that
obligation
of
citizenship
that
is
a
primary
obligation,
and
goes
outside
of
the
country,
then
you
have
the
--
the
question
of
deportation
and
--
and
whether
or
not
he
has
a
right
to
come
back
in
but
if
he
just
stays
here
and
continues
to
live
here,
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
further
problem
that
the
court
would
have
to
address
itself
that
it
doesn't
have
before
it
in
this
case
or
any
of
the
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
maybe
i
can
help
a
little
more
because
i
think
that
the
whole
history
of
this
problem
has
been
dealing
with
the
clashes
between
the
sovereignty
of
this
country
and
its
obligations
to
its
citizens
and
that
of
another
country.
that
comes
in
to
the
picture
if
a
man
goes
to
another
country
and
obtain
sanctuary
and
of
--
of
the
benefits
of
staying
in
that
country
whatever
rights
he
has
an
alien
in
that
country
against
our
demands
for
him
which
you
don't
have
if
he
stays
within
our
country.
now,
i'm
not
saying
one
isn't
reprehensible
and
the
other
is
all
right
but
i
think
you
have
this
problem
in
regard
to
foreign
relations
which
was
historically
where
this
whole
matter
began
in
the
case
where
the
draft
evader
goes
out
of
the
country
and
stays
and
then
loses
his
citizenship
that
you
don't
have
in
the
other
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
first
i'd
like
to
say
that
i
certainly
would
not
say
that
you
can
take
the
citizenship
away
from
american
citizen
for
any
crime.
i
think
that
there
has
to
be
a
fundamental
connection
between
the
obligations
to
that
citizenship
and
the
particular
act
that
you're
dealing
with
when
you
say
that
you've
expatriate
or
lose
his
citizenship
because
of
that.
but
i
think
the
only
basis
that
you
could
possibly
say
that
you
would
take
the
one
group
for
the
man
who
goes
out
of
the
country
and
take
his
citizenship
away
because
of
that
and
not
for
the
other
group,
it
would
be
because
there
was
a
real
sound
difference
that
this
court
found
between
the
two
situations
that
the
one
caused
a
problem
in
regard
to
foreign
relations
that
the
congress
was
fairly
and
honestly
dealing
with
but
you
didn't
have
in
the
other
situation
which
would
justify
the
action.
now,
whether
it
was
the
wise
thing
to
expatriate
in
the
one
case
and
not
from
the
other,
it
would
seem
not
--
to
me
not
to
be
the
constitutional
question
the
court
would
be
trying
to
resolve.
he
would
be
trying
to
see
whether
there
was
any
sound
basis
or
justification
for
the
congress
in
making
the
difference
whether
it
should
later
reach
the
other
case
too
for
some
reason.
it
would
seem
to
me
not
to
be
part
of
the
problem.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
there
is
a
--
a
difference
in
regard
to
our
expedition
treaties
and
most
situations
would
cover
the
murder
case,
i
think.
but
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
to
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
it
does
if
he
goes
away
because
i
think
you
have
the
same
problems
of
whether
he
would
be
harbored
and
whether
it
would
be
obligations
to
him
as
an
alien
in
a
foreign
country
by
reason
of
that
going
into
that
country.
but
i
do
think
you
have
this
basic
thing
that
that
this
is
a
cardinal
element
of
citizenship
that
there
is
an
obligation
if
you
want
to
be
a
citizen
to
preserve
the
very
life
of
the
country
that
you
claim
you're
a
citizen
of.
and
i'm
not
saying
that
just
because
a
man
murdered
another
man
and
went
to
another
country
even
if
it
involves
all
kinds
of
foreign
relations
trouble
that
you
should
be
able
to
take
his
citizenship
away
because
i
don't
think
that
relates
itself
to
the
citizenship
but
i
think
that
when
you
talk
about
deserting
in
time
of
war
whether
the
man
is
engaged
in
--
his
unit
is
engaged
in
combat
and
you
can
avoid
the
fight
that
--
where
you
might
get
killed
in
order
to
save
your
country
and
where
you
evade
the
draft
so
that
you
won't
outrun
that
risk
of
being
killed
in
saving
your
country.
but
those
are
the
very
most
fundamental
things
about
the
preservation
of
the
country
and
citizenship.
and
that
citizenship,
in
my
concept,
and
i'm
confident
in
most
americans,
involves
obligations
on
both
sides,
the
country
and
the
individual
and
certainly
there's
no
question
about
the
value
them
--
of
them
to
the
citizen
and
what
he
gets
in
this
country
above
all
others
in
the
world.
but
on
the
other
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
hand,
he
has
certain
responsibilities.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
am
sure
of
that
but
i
think
there
is
a
further
factor
in
the
thinking
of
congress
that
the
court
will
have
to
determine
in
this
case
and
that
is
whether
or
not
it's
reasonable
not
only
to
punish
for
the
act
but
to
conclude
that
that
person
really
shows
no
allegiance
by
his
very
act
to
the
united
states.
now,
i
say,
in
order
to
have
anything
like
that,
any
such
conclusion,
the
act
has
to
be
one
that's
so
cardinal,
so
fundamental
to
the
relationship
of
the
obligations
of
citizenship
that
everyone
would
recognize
that
it
is
a
primary
obligation
but
once
you
find
that,
it
seems
to
me,
that
then
you
have
a
situation
where
congress
can
reasonably
determine
that
this
person
has
repudiated
all
his
obligations
and
therefore
his
allegiance
to
his
country.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
on
each
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
would
say
no
to
the
answer
to
the
first
question,
mr.
justice.
i
wouldn't
say
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
of
course,
in
this
particular
case,
there
is
no
conflict
about
the
fact
that
this
was
a
political
election
when
he
voted.
now,
with
regard
to
the
kind
of
elections
that
i'm
sure
would
bother
you
--
bother
anyone,
the
congress
has
dealt
with
ameliorative
legislation
to
considerable
extent
with
all
that
type
of
election,
hence,
provide
for
short
form
nationalization
in
regard
to
the
italian
elections
and
some
of
the
german
elections
and
a
number
of
different
situations
where
there
could
be
some
reasonable
basis
for
the
action
in
trying
to
help
the
interest
of
the
united
states
even
as
was
considered
in
some
of
those
situations
and
also
to
help
a
particular
problem
in
that
country
rather
than
showing
any
particular
allegiance
to
that
country
as
such.
so
if
the
congress
has
tried,
and
i
think
very
carefully,
to
narrow
this
situation
down
and
--
or
there
were
some
reasonable
doubt
about
whether
the
person
was
trying
to
actually
showing
the
allegiance
or
participate
in
establishing
the
--
the
government
or
the
controlling
governing
people
in
a
foreign
country,
that
they've
given
all
kinds
of
provisions
for
that
--
to
restore
their
citizenship
with
very
little
difficulty.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
when
you're
to
say
in
a
particular
way,
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
[laughs]
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
couldn't
--
i
couldn't
take
that.
what
i
think
the
congress
was
doing
in
those
particular
situations
that
we
referred
to
in
our
brief
was
--
there
was
a
showing
of
considerable
extent
to
the
congress
that
people
did
vote
in
the
italian
elections
and
some
of
the
german
elections
and
other
elections
because
whether
they
were
wise
about
it
or
otherwise,
they
were
trying
to
help
a
certain
cause
that
they
felt
was
in
the
interest
of
our
country
and
so
they
made
such
a
provision.
but
i
--
i
don't
know
of
anytime
that
they've
tried
to
address
themselves
to
whether
a
person
was
casting
a
good
vote
or
a
bad
vote
as
i
gather
from
your
question,
i
wouldn't
say
that
that
was
a
reasonable
classification.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
--
all
i
know
about
that
is
the
particular
matter
in
the
brief
and
i
should
have
checked
into
that.
i'll
check
into
that
report
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
a
political
election.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
my
reaction
would
have
been
that
it
couldn't
have
been
a
political
election
in
accordance
of
the
requirement
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
from
the
--
what
you
have
said
about
the
report,
i
think
it's
an
--
it
isn't
quite
fair
to
say
that
the
attorney
general
made
such
ruling,
and
i
--
and
i
understand
you
didn't
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
the
attorney
general
really
was
just
trying
to
give
the
courts
an
opportunity
to
decide
the
question.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
would
seem
to
me
that
in
this
area,
there
are
a
number
of
problems
--
questions
the
court
must
determine
upon
deciding
whether
or
not
the
particular
statute
is
reasonable
in
finding
that
expatriation
will
follow.
first,
there
would
be
the
question
of
the
relationship
of
the
statute
in
dealing
with
other
countries
that
i
have
tried
at
some
length.
and
i
think
mackenzie
against
hare
is
one
example
and
savorgnan
is
another.
those
cases,
as
counsel,
was
relating
the
situation
seemed
to
me
so
comparable
to
perez
in
some
ways
in
that
if
--
if
you
could
get
any
clear
understanding
of
what
was
being
claimed
in
the
mackenzie
case,
the
lady
certainly
didn't
want
to
give
up
her
citizenship
in
united
states.
and
she
made
that
very
clear
time
after
time.
but
she
did
marry
the
man
she
wanted
to
marry
to.
so
her
act
in
marrying
was
a
voluntary
act
and
--
but
she
had
no
subjective
intent
to
lose
her
american
citizenship
at
the
same
time
but
that
was
what
--
was
the
result.
it
seem
--
it
seemed
that
the
same
is
true
in
the
savorgnan
case.
there
was
a
--
an
act
of
allegiance
to
the
italian
government
but
there
was
also
a
desire
on
her
part,
very
real
one,
to
continue
to
be
an
american
citizen
and
no
subjective
intent
to
give
it
up
but
the
congress
had
said
that
by
doing
this
particular
act
of
pledging
allegiance
to
the
foreign
country
that
she
did
--
did
lose
her
citizenship
and
the
court
so
held.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
in
the
case
of
mackenzie
against
hare,
the
court
dealt
with
the
constitutional
power
and
said
that
it
was
a
material
part
of
sovereignty
of
the
country.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
and
it
cited
the
case
curtiss-wright
and
a
number
of
other
cases
in
--
that
we
have
dealt
with
at
length
in
the
(inaudible)
brief
in
regard
to
the
fact
that
united
states
has
to
be
a
nation
like
other
nations
of
the
world
that
it
has
to
have
the
necessary
powers
that
go
with
that
to
conduct
its
relations
with
other
countries
and
therefore,
it
was
inherent
part
of
that
sovereign
power
that
was
relied
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
it
would
have
to
be
reasonable.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
it
will
be
due
process
in
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
fifth
amendment.
then
i
think
you
do
have
a
question
in
the
eighth
amendment
as
to
whether
it's
a
--
an
unreasonable
penalty
or
punishment,
and
i
--
i
don't
think
its
present
in
these
cases
but
i
think
that
the
court
want
to
consider
that
question
and
we
deal
with
it
at
length
in
the
brief.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
has
been
exercised
by
most
civilized
countries
in
very
broad
provisions
but
our
search
did
not
reveal
that
had
--
it
had
been
applied
to
natural
born
citizens
in
other
countries.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
--
it's
generally
applied
there
but
not
to
natural
born
citizen
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
more
narrowly
than
some.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
quite
--
quite
broadly
in
the
commonwealth
but
not
to
natural
born
citizens.
so
that
the
other
civilized
nations
of
the
world
that
we
are
familiar
with
and
deal
with
constantly
and
to
think
they
have
somewhat
background
we
do
in
many
ways
have
the
same
--
have
had
the
same
problem
and
have
to
deal
with
it
and
it
made
provisions.
now,
that
we
referred
to
in
the
brief
in
detail
and
you
can
find
it
in
a
study
at
a
considerable
length
that
was
made
by
the
united
nations
in
regard
to
this
problem.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it's
a
question
of
whether
it's
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
will
think
in
regard
to
--
if
you
consider
it
as
a
penalty
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
i
do
--
i
do
not
think
that
that
applies
in
these
cases.
but
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that
it's
because
in
regard
to
the
political
election,
it's
an
indication
of
allegiance
to
the
foreign
country
by
us
participating
in
it
and
i
think
that
where
you
have
the
problem
of
the
dual
national
like
we
do
in
the
perez
case
that
there
are
all
the
questions
of
the
relationship
with
a
foreign
country
that
involved
in
that.
i
think
in
the
draft
evasion
case,
more
simply
as
we
have
in
the
mendoza-martinez
case
that
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
person
has
repudiated
the
fundamental
or
basic
or
cardinal
principle
or
obligation
of
citizenship
and
therefore,
congress
thought,
separate
and
apart
from
the
penalty
that
was
provided
otherwise
that
anybody
who
would
so
treat
his
country
should
lose
his
citizenship.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
because
i
think
it's
--
it's
an
indication
on
the
part
of
the
citizen
that
he
doesn't
want
to
do
anything
to
preserve
these
rights
that
he
claims
are
so
precious.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
it
could
be.
i
don't
think
it
is
in
this
particular
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
you
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
probably
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
reasonable
because
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
[laughs]
i
--
i
know
but
i
--
i'm
not
trying
to
making
the
matter
semantic
but
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
if
you
include
in
the
word
“reasonable”,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it's
cruel
and
inhuman
punishment,
if
it's
--
if
it's
reasonable,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
it
could
be.
that's
what
i
mean
by
my
--
trying
to
answer
it
that
way.
if
you
don't
assume
that,
then
i
think
you
have
to
reach
the
question
on
whether
it
is
a
cruel
and
inhuman
punishment
if
you
find
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
history
is
such
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
way
that
the
court
has
examined
in
the
penalties
in
the
past,
there
is
a
punishment
involved.
now,
i
don't
think
there's
any
punishment
involved
in
this
case
because
that
wasn't
what
the
congress
was
trying
to
do.
we
concede
--
the
government
concede
that
back
in
1865,
there
was
language
of
penalty
used
and
the
congress
provide
it
specifically
for
trial
and
conviction
and
so
forth.
but
when
you
get
down
to
the
draft
evasion
provision
in
the
late
--
the
act
that
we're
now
dealing
with
in
1944,
the
congress
deliberately
separated
the
question
of
this
particular
incident
of
expatriation
from
the
other
provisions
in
regard
to
the
penalty
for
draft
evasion.
and
the
court
has
said
that
that's
an
indication
that
it
should
take
into
account
as
to
whether
or
not
punishment
or
penalty
is
intended
and
then
the
history
shows
that
the
attorney
general
recommending
it,
the
cabinet
committee
and
the
reports
were
trying
to
deal
with
this
kind
of
an
incident
relating
to
this
--
the
rights
of
citizenship,
that
is
the
privileges
of
citizenship
or
nationality
as
distinguished
from
the
penalties
for
the
act
of
evading
the
draft
itself
and
this
court
has
said
that
those
different
factors
should
be
considered.
and
if
you
find
that
they're
present
that
they
all
go
to
show
that
it
wasn't
intended
--
intend
to
be
a
punishment
or
penalty.
and
after
all,
this
court
has
said
time
after
time
that
you
don't
look
to
try
to
find
a
statute
unconstitutional,
you
look
to
try
to
see
if
it
is
not
--
if
--
if
it
cannot
fairly
be
found
to
be
within
the
constitution
and
that
congress
has
the
power
to
do
what
it
did.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
you've
given
great
breath
to
necessary
and
proper
in
many
decisions
as
to
the
power
of
congress
and
the
various
powers
that
it
has
to
have
to
exist
and
continue
to
deal
with
the
various
problems
this
country
has
and
congress
has
to
deal
with
from
time
to
time
and
i
don't
think
that
the
inherent
powers
of
the
united
states
as
a
country
should
be
limited
except
as
the
various
amendments
expressly
do
that.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
country
has
got
to
be
among
the
family
of
nations.
it
has
to
be
able
to
exert
the
powers
that
are
necessary
to
conduct
itself
and
carry
on
its
place
in
the
family
of
nations.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i'm
quite
sure
they
did.
and
i
think
that
back
in
mcculloch
against
maryland
that
you
--
this
court
considered
that
and
found
that
it
had
the
powers
that
were
intended
by
the
founders
in
order
to
conduct
itself
as
a
great
nation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
it
modifies
the
other,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
may
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
may
it
please
the
court.
i'll
try
to
answer
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question
first.
i
think
there's
no
problem
at
all
about
the
question
that
you
asked.
section
503
of
the
1940
act
which
would
be
controlling
under
all
of
these
cases,
in
54
statutes
at
large
at
page
1171,
provides
for
an
independent
trial
de
novo
on
the
question
of
nationality
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
and
it's
been
uniformly
so
construed.
so
that
--
and
in
nishikawa
case
in
the
transcript
shows
that
that's
the
section
under
which
the
action
is
brought
in
specific
terms
and
the
rest
of
them
were
brought
under
that
provision
of
the
statute
so
that
this
section
gives
them
a
trial
de
novo
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
due
process.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
in
pretrial.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i'd
have
to
compare
to
know
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
he
has
a
trial
de
novo
on
the
question
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
before
a
district
court
of
the
united
states
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
for
the
district
of
columbia
or
in
the
district
court
of
the
united
states
for
the
district
in
which
such
person
claims
a
permanent
residence
for
a
judgment
declaring
him
to
be
a
national
of
the
united
states.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
guess
in
the
trial
de
novo
on
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
and
i
would
think
that
would
satisfy
all
the
constitutional
requirements
in
regard
to
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
he
doesn't
get
it
under
our
practice
in
many
situations
and
it
still
complies
with
due
process
according
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
all
i
could
say
that
this
court
has
recognized
many
such
trials
as
being
due
process
but
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
would
be
something
else,
yes
sir.
but
this
is
a
procedure
that's
recognized
in
many
areas
of
the
determination
of
rights
of
citizens
as
being
due
process.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
would
depend
upon
the
statute.
but
then
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
ordinarily,
he
would
be.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
there
isn't
any
question
of
what
is
that
the
line
is
between
petty
offenses
but
the
precise
line
depends
on
the
particular
cases
i
would
think.
i
want
to
also
correct
one
statement
i
made
about
the
breadth
of
action
in
other
countries.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
think
congress
dealt
with
it
as
providing
in
a
declaratory
judgment
that
would
give
him
the
complete
review
on
the
facts.
of
course,
in
this
particular
case,
in
the
perez
case,
there
is
no
issue
about
the
facts.
they're
all
admitted.
there
isn't
any
on
what
the
particular
act
was
performed.
they
admitted
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
is
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
would
say
no
if
you
say
that
you
have
to
find
subjective
intent.
but
if
you
have
to
find
merely
that
he
did
evade
the
draft
for
this
or
went
to
a
foreign
country
and
stayed
there
for
the
purpose
of
evading
the
draft
and
he
admits
that
fact
as
he
does
here
then
i
don't
think
there's
any
issue
of
that.
you
see,
he
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
admits
that
not
only
that
he
went
to
the
foreign
country
and
stayed
there
but
that
he
did
it
for
this
very
purpose.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
i
--
i
don't
think
they
could
be
lumped
together
if
you
say
that
there
has
to
be
subjective
intent.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
of
course,
that
concedes
their
argument
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
but
we
don't.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
what
i
meant
was
that
there
was
no
issue
between
us
that
the
facts
were
any
different.
we
--
both
sides
agree
that
the
facts
in
this
case
are
that
he
did
live
down
there,
that
he
did
vote
in
this
election
and
it
was
a
political
election
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
that
he
stayed
out
of
the
country
--
went
out
of
the
country
and
stayed
out
of
the
country
to
evade
the
draft
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
and
he
conceded
all
of
those.
so,
there's
no
issue
as
to
those
facts.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
shouldn't
be.
they
ought
to
be
the
same
facts
before
a
jury
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
jury
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
before
a
court.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
know
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
and
might.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
he
came
in
--
he
tried
to
come
into
the
country
and
they
sought
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
would
think
there
would
be
a
right
available
to
him
under
the
declaratory
judgment
act.
there
would
be
a
justiciable
controversy
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
seems
to
me
the
start
of
the
section
is
adequate
and
fully
satisfies
the
requirements.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
i'm
sure.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right,
sir.
