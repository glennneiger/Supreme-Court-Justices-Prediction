cause
of
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
mr.
horsky
go
a
little
farther
than
that,
mr.
davis?
you
say
that
if
the
--
if
it
was
essential
to
the
government
in
its
external
relations
that
there
was
some
latitude?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
very
distinction,
mr.
davis,
between
losing
rights
of
citizenship
and
losing
citizenship
in
the
sense
of
nationality?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
hasn't
the
term
"rights
of
citizenship"
been
used
in
--
universally
in
this
country
in
a
--
in
a
different
sense?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
seems
to
me
that
most
states
of
the
union
provide
that
when
a
man
is
convicted
of
a
felony,
that
he
--
he
loses
certain
rights
of
citizenship.
but
it
does
not
attempt
--
they
do
not
attempt
to
say
that
he's
no
longer
a
citizen
of
the
state.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
mind
giving
me
that
citation
again
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
our
position
is
that
in
this
field
as
in
so
many
others,
the
court
has
to
weigh
in
the
balance
the
powers
of
congress
and
--
and
the
reason
the
--
the
powers
of
congress,
the
detriments
of
the
citizen
has
to
weigh
in
the
balance
the
cherished
status
of
citizenship
as
this
court
has
said,
it's
a
precious
and
cherished
status.
it
has
to
weigh
that
in
the
balance
in
deciding
whether
it
is
reasonable
and
rational
in
the
circumstances
for
congress
to
impose
this
--
this
requirement.
as
in
so
many
other
instances,
it's
a
matter
of
--
of
weighing.
and
unless
the
court
can
say
that
congress
was
arbitrary,
there
was
no
rational
basis
then
we
think
that
there
can
be
no
invalidation
of
the
statute.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may.

mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
those
are
admissions
sort
of
in
bond,
aren't
they?
didn't
he
come
over
in
that
work
program
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
during
the
war
where
we
let
mexicans
come
over
--
over
here
on
the
understanding
that
they
are
to
go
back
after
six
months
or
so?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no.
i
--
i
say.
but
he
--
he
did
come
in
under
that
program
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
that
kind
of
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
understand.
chief
justice
earl
warren
general,
i'll
probably
just
to
break
there
for
a
moment.
may
i
ask
this?
if
the
facts
of
this
case
were
changed
only
to
the
extent
that
the
mother
and
the
father
of
perez
were
native-born
americans,
would
you
be
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
only
reason
i
asked
it
was
because
you
placed
some
emphasis
upon
the
dual
citizenship
of
this
man
and
his
conduct
in
living
over
there
and
i
just
--
i
just
wondered
if
--
if
basically
that
would
--
that
makes
any
difference
with
your
case.
may
we
treat
this
case
just
as
though
the
parents
of
perez
were
native-born
americans?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
general,
is
that
--
is
that
was
really
than
--
than
a
man
who
hides
out
in
this
country
throughout
the
war,
changes
his
name,
his
--
his
place
of
living
and
uses
forged
documents
and
so
forth
to
evade
the
military
service
and
--
and
effectually
does
evade
the
--
the
service
just
as
much
as
perez
did?
is
he
not
just
as
disregardful
of
citizenship
as
--
as
this
man?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
it
is
your
position,
the
draft
evader
in
--
in
this
country
never
left
the
country
at
all
and
regardless
of
dual
citizenship
could
be
deprived
of
his
citizenship
for
draft
evasion.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
but
--
but
i
say
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
say
to
you,
it's
your
position
that
they
could
do
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
might
--
might
even
be
more
reprehensible
because
he
stays
here
and
accepts
all
of
the
benefits
of
citizenship,
all
of
the
--
all
of
the
freedom
and
all
of
the
protections
that
this
country
gives
him
while
he's
here
but
when
he
is
in
another
country,
he
at
least
is
on
--
he's
on
his
own
and
not
--
not
any
burden
on
this
--
this
country.
it's
--
it's
difficult
for
me
to
see
the
difference
between
the
two
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
i
may
--
if
i
may
ask
just
one
other
question.
suppose
in
other
--
other
serious
crimes
that
congress
makes
the
distinction
between
people
who
commit
a
crime
then
live
in
this
country
and
those
who
commit
the
crime
and
flee
from
the
justice
of
this
country
and
go
to
--
to
another
country,
do
you
think
they
could
make
a
distinction
between
the
two
to
such
an
extent
that
they
could
take
the
citizenship
from
the
man
who
does
go
to
the
foreign
country
and
--
and
not
take
it
from
a
--
from
a
man
who
remains
here?
you
know,
we
do
have
thousands
of
--
of
people
who
commit
crimes
and
--
and
then
leave
this
--
this
country
and
sometimes
they
never
come
--
never
come
back
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
their
citizenship
is
not
affected
even
though
they're
most
serious
crime.
but
do
you
--
do
you
make
a
difference
between
those
two
--
distinction
between
those
two?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
was
just
wondering
if
you
put
it
on
the
basis
of
our
foreign
relations.
if
a
man
leaves
this
country
and
stays
over
in
another
country
just
to
avoid
the
draft,
how
would
it
be
more
--
how
would
it
more
greatly
involve
our
foreign
relations
than
if
--
if
a
man
committed
murder
and
went
to
a
foreign
country
and
remained
there
in
order
to
avoid
justice
in
this
country?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
take
serious
crime
that
isn't
and
there
are
a
lot
of
crimes
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
are
not
subject
to
deportation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
difficult.
i'm
just
trying
to
--
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
how
it
affects
our
foreign
relations
more
in
one
case
than
--
than
in
the
other.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
that's
true
and
i
think
no
matter
how
any
of
us
may
view
this
case,
i
don't
think
anybody
would
object
to
the
government
punishing
the
man
from
doing
that,
punishing
him
to
--
to
--
very
severely
desertion.
there's
no
--
there's
no
complaint
made
even
to
the
death
penalty
under
certain
circumstances.
so
it
--
i
--
i
think
the
fact
that
one
might
question
the
doctrine
that
you
laid
down
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
mean
that
you
doubt
that
the
government
was
not
in
a
position
to
punish
--
punish
very
severely
for
the
--
for
the
things
that
you
point
out
as
a
punishment
taking
human
life
and
other
--
other
very
serious
offenses.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
congress
have
--
have
the
right
to
say
that
if
i
--
the
one
man
votes
in
a
particular
election
or
if
he
votes
in
a
particular
way
that
it
is
either
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states
or
against
the
interest
of
the
united
states,
and
in
one
instance,
he
is
entitled
to
keep
his
citizenship
than
in
the
other,
he
is
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
we
were
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
talking
about
that
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
the
wine
and
beer
relation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
general,
you
might
as
well
answer
that
after
lunch.
i
thank
you.
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
general,
at
the
outset
of
your
--
of
your
argument,
you
impressed
on
us
that
we
ought
to
view
this
case
in
the
light
of
the
facts,
namely,
that
this
man
was
down
there
in
mexico
from
the
time
he
was
nine
or
ten
years
old,
that
he
--
he
married
a
woman,
had
seven
children
and
--
and
a
lot
of
other
things
happened
down
in
--
in
mexico
and
you
told
us
that
we
should
take
those
things
into
consideration.
now,
how
can
you
say
then
that
there
wasn't
a
factual
situation
for
the
court
to
take
into
consideration
and
then
--
and
that
all
they
had
to
do
was
just
--
just
to
determine
whether
he
actually
voted
down
there
and
whether
he
actually
stayed
away.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
you
are
before
a
jury,
don't
you
think
that
--
that
the
facts
as
they're
presented
by
each
side
as
to
this
man
living
down
there
and
his
family
and
everything
and
why
he
came
up
to
--
to
america
and
so
forth.
and
those
two
occasions
he
came,
don't
you
think
those
all
might
be
presented
in
a
different
way
that
might
call
for
a
review?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
open
to
--
he
never
received
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
a
proceeding.
you
know
they
do
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
besides
do
present
their
facts
in
a
little
different
way.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
horsky.
