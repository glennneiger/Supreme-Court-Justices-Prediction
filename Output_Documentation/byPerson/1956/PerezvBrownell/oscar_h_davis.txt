mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
now
on
the
docket
of
the
court,
four
cases
involving
issues
of
loss
of
nationality.
three
of
them
are
being
argued
today,
tomorrow
and
one
still
pending
on
petition
for
certiorari.
i
think
it
may
be
helpful
if
i
run
through
briefly
the
cases
and
the
issues
involved.
in
the
present
case
as
mr.
horsky
has
stated,
the
only
issue
is
the
validity
of
section
401
(e),
voting,
and
section
401
(j),
draft
evasion,
of
the
1940
nationality
act.
in
the
case
which
follows,
the
nishikawa
case,
the
issue
of
constitutional
validity
involves
section
401
(c)
that
is
service
by
a
dual
national
in
the
army
of
his
other
state.
there
is
also
in
that
case
a
statutory
procedural
issue
of
duress.
in
the
third
case,
the
trop
case,
number
710,
the
issue
is
the
constitutional
validity
of
401
(g)
relating
to
desertion
from
the
armed
forces
and
conviction
thereof
during
time
of
war.
there
was
also
a
subsidiary
issue
of
what
the
meaning
of
desertion
is
as
a
statutory
matter
in
that
case.
and
not
set
for
argument
is
the
mendoza-martinez
case,
number
623,
which
also
involves
the
validity
of
section
401
(j),
draft
evasion.
there
is
no
other
issue
in
that
case
at
all.
so
if
you
take
these
four
cases
together,
the
court
is
faced
with
the
issue
of
the
validity
of
four
subsections
of
section
401
of
the
1940
nationality
act,
service
in
a
foreign
army
by
dual
national,
voting,
desertion
and
draft
evasion.
i
stressed
the
fact
that
as
the
1940
nationality
act
in
each
one
of
these
four
cases
and
not
the
1952
immigration
and
nationality
act
because
the
1952
act
is
in
some
respects
different.
and
the
cases
you
have
before
you,
shall
i
say,
bear
on
that
act
in
--
only
insofar
as
the
provisions
were
incorporated
identically
or
without
substantial
changes.
the
facts
have
been
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
mr.
justice.
three
of
them
--
two
of
them
are
deportations,
one
is
an
exclusion
case.
the
present
case
is
perez
as
deportation.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
nishikawa
case,
the
next
one
is
an
exclusion
case.
the
third
--
the
--
the
trop
case
doesn't
involve
deportation
or
exclusion
at
all.
it's
a
man
who
wants
a
passport
and
the
passport
was
refused
on
the
ground
he
is
no
longer
a
citizen.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
think
it
will,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
as
i
will
say
in
a
moment.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
the
reason,
mr.
justice,
it
will
not
raise
your
problem
is
that
this
arises
under
the
1940
nationality
act.
under
that
act,
there
was
section
503
which
provided
for
a
de
novo
declaratory
judgment
action
for
any
claim
of
citizenship,
whether
it
was
through
exclusion
or
deportation.
it
is
somewhat
different
in
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
--
that's
right.
and
--
and
it's
somewhat
different
in
the
1952
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
act
but
in
the
cases
you
have
before
you,
there
was
by
right
of
law
a
de
novo
judicial
determination
in
each
of
these
four
cases.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
horsky
has
correctly
stated
the
facts.
i
would
just
like
to
summarize
the
facts
in
the
present
case,
the
perez
case.
and
if
i
also
may
in
the
mendoza-martinez
case
which
is
not
set
for
argument
because
that
also
involves
section
401
(j),
draft
evasion
and
has
a
difference
which
may
or
may
not
be
significant.
in
the
present
case,
here
is
a
man
who
lived
in
mexico
from
the
time
he
was
ten
years
of
age.
he,
during
the
war
in
1943
and
1944,
came
into
this
country
as
a
mexican,
claiming
mexican
nationality.
he
then
returned
to
mexico
after
the
--
this
provision
relating
to
expatriation
or
loss
of
nationality
for
draft
evasion
was
enacted
in
september
1944.
after
that
time,
he
returned
to
mexico
and
stayed
in
mexico
until
1947,
i
believe.
and
it
is
admitted
on
this
record
that
he
stayed
there
for
the
purpose
of
draft
evasion.
he
also
voted
in
the
presidential
election
in
mexico
in
1946
by
his
own
admission.
one
matter
that
i
would
like
to
stress
because
there
is
some
reference
into
the
brief
--
in
a
brief
to
the
fact
that
he
may
not
be
a
mexican
is
that
he
three
times
sought
admission
to
this
country
as
a
mexican
national.
in
fact,
the
reason
why
he
is
now
being
deported
is
he
came
illegally
into
the
country
claiming
mexican
nationality.
and
then
after
some
time
reported
himself
to
the
immigration
authorities
and
said,
"i
am
not
really
a
mexican.
i'm
an
american
citizen.
i
want
to
adjust
my
status."
and
of
course
they
began
deportation
proceedings.
in
the
mendoza-martinez
case,
that
petitioner
resided
in
this
country
from
1922
at
birth
until
1940,
who
registered
for
the
draft.
in
1942,
he
went
to
mexico
and
remained
there
until
1946
for
the
admitted
purpose
of
evading
the
draft.
he
then
returned
to
this
country
and
in
1947,
pleaded
guilty
to
a
--
accusation
of
draft
evasion
and
was
sentenced,
and
i
believe
served
a
year.
then
--
he
then
went
back
to
mexico.
and
in
returning
to
this
country
in
1952,
he
then
returned
to
--
he
then
returned
to
this
country
in
1953,
i
believe,
and
was
then
picked
up
for
having
entered
the
country
illegally,
being
a
mexican
national
without
the
proper
entry
permits
and
papers.
those
are
the
facts
in
these
two
cases
which
involved
section
401
(j),
draft
evasion.
as
to
the
general
power
of
congress
over
loss
of
nationality,
i
think
it's
important
if
i
may
to
try
to
clarify
an
ambiguity
in
the
word
expatriation.
the
word
expatriation
has
two
meanings.
it
has
the
meaning
of
a
person
who
voluntarily
renounces
his
american
nationality
and
voluntarily
acquires
the
nationality
or
allegiance
of
another
country.
and
it
is
frequently
used
in
that
sense
throughout
our
history
and
in
some
of
the
opinions
of
this
court.
but
it
has
a
broader
meaning
than
that.
it
has
the
broader
meaning
of
loss
of
nationality
which
can
be
imposed
by
congress
even
though
the
individual
does
not
wish
to
give
up
his
american
nationality.
and
it's
in
that
broader
meaning
that
it
has
been
used
by
this
court
too.
in
mackenzie
against
hare,
mr.
justice
mckenna
did
not
refer
to
mrs.
mackenzie's
loss
of
nationality
as
an
expatriation.
he
said
it
was
tantamount
to
expatriation.
it
was
akin
to
it.
he
was
referring
to
loss
of
nationality.
now,
the
petitioners
in
these
cases
have
raised
different
--
different
arguments
for
saying
that
congress
has
no
constitutional
power
to
pass
these
statutes.
the
broadest
argument
which
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
is
not
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
for
this
purpose,
i
--
i
use
them
exactly
equivalent.
and
i
shall
have
occasion
to
point
out
that
the
statute
of
1865
which
was
the
first
statute
which
provided
for
a
loss
of
the
rights
of
citizenship
and
with
relation
to
draft
evasion
and
desertion
was
construed
administratively,
and
within
its
own
terms
as
a
loss
of
nationality
statute
rather
than
merely
a
loss
of
the
rights
of
--
of
citizenship.
the
--
the
petitioner's
stand
on
different
propositions,
first,
which
is
the
broadest
position
which
is
not
the
position
taken
by
mr.
horsky
in
this
case
is
that
congress
has
no
power
whatsoever
to
do
anything
more
than
to
aid
or
implement
a
renunciation
of
--
of
citizenship
by
an
american
citizen
voluntarily
undertaken.
that
is
congress
has
no
power
whatsoever
to
impose
loss
of
nationality
in
the
absence
of
the
consent
of
the
citizen
to
the
loss
of
nationality.
as
i
understand
the
brief,
that
is
the
position
taken
in
the
succeeding
case,
the
nishikawa
case.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
that's
the
second
position.
i
--
i
meant
to
say
that
the
broadest
position
was
not
the
position
taken
by
mr.
horsky.
he
has
taken
it
by
the
brief
as
i
--
as
i
read
the
brief
in
the
next
case,
the
nishikawa
case.
mr.
horsky's
position
is
somewhat
narrower.
he
concedes
that
the
government
--
that
congress
has
power
if
the
citizen
acquires
the
nationality
or
allegiance
of
another
government.
i
don't
believe
he
went
further
than
that
in
relation
in
--
with
respect
to
international
relations.
i
think
he
limited
it
to
the
acquisition
of
another
nationality
or
another
allegiance
regardless
of
the
individual
citizen's
desire
to
give
up
his
american
citizenship.
the
third
position
which
is
the
one
that
the
government
takes
in
these
cases
is
that
the
power
of
congress
is
a
power
inherent
in
its
--
in
--
in
the
sovereignty
of
the
united
states
as
a
nation
among
the
nations
of
the
world,
except
to
the
extent
that
the
power
of
congress
is
limited
by
the
specific
provisions
of
the
constitution.
congress
has
the
same
power
to
regulate
nationality
as
all
the
other
nations
of
the
world.
the
united
nations
has
collected
laws
concerning
nationality
then
the
volume
which
is
published
in
1954.
a
quick
survey
of
this
volume
will
show
that
almost
without
exception,
there
may
be
a
few,
almost
without
exception,
every
nation
in
the
world
has
provisions
relating
to
nationality
at
birth,
acquisition
of
citizenship
and
also
loss
of
citizenship.
and
it
is
our
position
that
congress
has
this
same
power
except
to
the
extent
that
it
may
be
limited
by
the
provisions
of
the
constitution.
and
i
shall
in
a
moment
discuss
the
limitations
as
we
see
it
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
the
broad
power
that
we
think
congress
has
and
which
i
--
i
may
say
was
specifically
confirmed
in
the
mackenzie
and
hare
opinion
in
a
section
which
is
quoted
in
our
brief
and
which
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
read
a
few
words
to
the
court.
mr.
justice
mckenna
was
dealing
with
the
proposition
that
congress
had
no
power
except
to
implement
or
confirm
the
consent
of
the
individual
citizen
to
lose
her
citizenship
and
he
said
this
is
wrong.
there
are
may
be
powers
implied
necessary
and
incidental
to
the
express
powers.
"as
a
government,
the
united
states
is
invested
with
all
the
attributes
of
sovereignty.
as
it
has
the
character
of
sovereignty
it
has
the
powers
of
nationality,
especially
those
which
concern
its
relations
and
intercourse
with
other
countries.
we
should
hesitate
long
before
limiting
or
embarrassing
such
powers."
and
he
then
goes
on
to
say
that
in
the
case
before
him,
the
mackenzie
case,
he
didn't
think
that
--
that
there
was
much
problem
because
he
thought
there
was
a
reasonable
basis
for
the
view
of
congress
that
the
--
having
a
wife
of
one
citizenship
and
a
husband
of
another
might,
and
his
word
is
might,
he
uses
the
word
may,
he
doesn't
even
say
would,
might
embarrass
the
united
states
in
its
foreign
relations.
i
started
to
say
before
that
the
government's
view
of
the
source
and
extent
of
the
power
of
congress
over
nationality
has
a
long
history.
it
is
confirmed
by
the
statutes
which
congress
has
enacted.
we
do
not
agree
that
congress
first
attempted
to
exercise
the
power
--
the
power
which
is
involved
here
in
1940.
we
think
it
attempted
to
do
that
and
it
did
do
that
in
the
statute
of
1865
which
provided
that
deserters
from
the
union
army
and
those
who
went
outside
their
districts
to
avoid
the
then
draft,
lost
the
rights
of
citizenship.
in
1907,
it
passed
the
statute
which
was
involving
mackenzie
against
hare.
in
1940,
it
passed
the
statute
which
is
before
the
court.
in
1952,
it
elaborated
on
and
in
fact
added
two
of
the
provisions
for
loss
of
nationality.
but
it's
not
only
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
relation
to
the
1865
statute,
it
did
use
the
term
"rights
of
citizenship."
but
in
that
very
same
statute
it
provided
that
aliens
should
not
--
who
deserted
the
army
or
who
evaded
the
draft
should
not
be
able
to
become
citizens,
indicating
that
this
was
a
matter
relating
to
nationality
and
not
only
to
the
rights
of
citizenship
such
as
voting.
that
is
the
way
it
was
administratively
construed
from
the
very
beginning.
in
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
believe
you
are
right
in
a
certain
sense,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
they
--
you
lose
certain
rights
of
citizenship.
but
the
term
“rights
of
citizenship”
was
used
by
congress
at
this
time
in
1865
and
for
years
before
and
years
after
as
synonymous
with
citizenship.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
try
to
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
prove
that
proposition.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
as
i
said
in
this
very
statute,
congress
said
that
if
you
evaded
the
draft
and
were
--
or
were
deserted
and
were
an
alien,
you
could
not
become
a
citizen.
in
the
famous
expatriation
statute
of
1868
to
which
mr.
horsky
referred,
which
confirmed
the
general
right
of
citizens
to
leave
this
country
and
to
expatriate
themselves,
congress
said
in
that
same
statute,
"we
have
invested
aliens
who
have
come
to
this
country
with
the
rights
of
citizenship,"
meaning
we
have
given
them
our
nationality.
in
another
statute,
which
was
passed
in
the
middle
of
the
19th
century,
congress
provided
that
children
of
american
citizen
--
citizens
born
abroad
should
be
americans.
but
it
also
went
on
to
say,
"but
the
rights
of
citizenship
shall
not
descend
to
the
children
of
fathers
who
have
never
resided
in
the
united
states.”
and
in
the
weedin
case,
in
274
united
states,
chief
justice
taft
held
for
a
unanimous
court
that
the
word
"rights
of
citizenship"
related
to
nationality
citizenship
and
did
not
descend
to
the
children
of
american
--
of
fathers
who
had
not
resided
in
the
united
states
prior
to
their
birth.
the
claim
was
that
if
he
resided
after
they
were
born,
it
was
enough.
and
there
are
other
statutes
cited
in
our
brief
which
refers
to
the
term
“rights
of
citizenship”
as
meaning
nationality
citizenship.
this
is
also
the
way
in
which,
i
believe,
the
1865
statute
was
construed
administratively.
in
1873,
president
grant
asked
all
the
members
of
his
cabinet
to
answer
certain
questions
relating
to
the
loss
of
nationality
and
expatriation.
and
the
replies
of
the
various
cabinet
members
are
collected
in
the
1873
edition
of
foreign
relations
part
two.
unfortunately,
we
did
not
include
this
in
our
brief.
so
i'd
like
to
mention
to
the
court
that
it's
in
the
1873
issue
of
foreign
relations,
part
two
at
page
1187.
in
1873,
about
less
than
nine
years
after
the
1865
statute
was
passed
and
the
secretary
of
state,
hamilton
fish,
in
answering
the
questions
relating
to
expatriation,
discussed
them
generally
and
then
he
said,
"and
it
will
be
remembered
that
congress
has
--
has
asserted
its
right
to
denationalize
its
own
citizens,
and
has
defined
one
mode
whereby
the
right
of
citizenship
shall
be
forfeited,
in
the
act
of
march
3,
1865,
which
provides
that."
and
he
went
on
to
paraphrase
the
statute
relating
to
desertion
from
the
army
and
draft
evasion.
he
used
the
words
"congress
has
asserted
its
rights
to
denationalize
its
own
citizens."

mr.

well,
i
was
coming
to
that
in
a
moment.
there
was
a
great
deal
--
throughout
the
19th
century.
there
was
a
great
deal
of
discussion
and
consideration
about
expatriation
and
whether
it
should
be
allowed
and
whether
it
should
not
be
allowed
and
what
conditions
and
mode.
president
grant
proprietary
to
asking
congress
for
a
statute
on
this
subject
asked
all
his
cabinet
members
while
he
asked
the
ones
who
were
not
related
to
this
matter,
i
don't
know.
but
he
asked
them
all
for
their
views
on
certain
specific
questions.
he
then
said
to
congress,
"please
pass
an
expatriation
statute.
we
have
treaties
in
this
field
but
we
do
not
have
specific
provisions.
we
think
it
is
necessary.
we
think
there
should
be
a
uniform
law.
here
are
the
views
of
my
cabinet
officers."
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
these
were
written
answers
which
are
included
in
the
foreign
relations
volumes,
published
in
1873.
not
only
is
this
--
was
this
the
view
of
the
secretary
of
state
in
1873,
shortly
after
the
statute
was
passed,
but
it
was
the
view
of
the
famous
citizenship
board
of
1906
which
secretary
of
state
elihu
root
setup
with
the
solicitor
james
brown
scott
and
the
minister
--
then
minister
of
the
netherlands
david
jayne
hill
and
the
chief
of
the
passport
bureau.
they
made
a
very
thorough
study
at
the
instance
of
congress
of
all
the
laws
of
the
united
states
relating
to
nationality
and
citizenship
and
they
made
recommendations.
and
in
their
discussion,
the
one
statute
that
they
discussed
as
relating
to
loss
of
citizenship
is
this
1865
statute.
in
1940
or
before
1940,
in
the
1930s,
when
congress
was
considering
the
nationality
act
of
1940,
mr.
richard
flournoy
who
was
the
assistant
legal
adviser
of
the
state
department
in
charge
of
nationality
matters
and
had
been,
i
think
since
1918
or
1919,
testified
that
though
the
statute
had
the
word
"loss
of
rights
of
citizenship"
and
that
there
was
some
ambiguity
in
that
is
that
it
has
always
been
interpreted
by
the
state
department
as
being
a
loss
of
nationality
or
loss
of
citizenship
statute.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
it
is
a
(voice
overlap)
--
as
a
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it's
a
--
house
document
326,
59th
congress,
second
session.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
it
is,
mr.
justice
brennan.
and
judge
hackworth's
compilation
in
the
1930s
also
indicates
that
the
state
department
viewed
this
statute
as
a
denationalization
statute,
not
as
merely
relating
to
loss
of
certain
rights
as
voting
and
so
forth.
the
courts
which
passed
upon
the
--
the
statute
in
the
1900s
--
i
mean
in
the
1800s,
the
1870s
and
1880s
were
of
course
not
--
not
concerned
with
deportation
or
nationality
in
the
national
sense
because
the
statutes
of
congress
at
that
time
didn't
provide
for
deportation.
they
were
concerned
with
issues
of
voting.
but
it's
significant
to
me
that
two
of
the
great
judges
who
wrote
opinions
on
this
statue,
jeremiah
smith
in
which
--
in
new
hampshire
and
justice
strong,
later
a
justice
of
this
court
in
--
in
the
pennsylvania
case,
both
referred
to
this
as
a
deprivation
or
forfeiture
of
citizenship
in
flat
terms.
i
don't
wish
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
these
cases
resolved
the
issue.
i
merely
cite
the
--
the
way
the
courts
referred
to
this
statute
as
indicating
that
it
was
a
statute
relating
to
loss
of
nationality,
loss
of
citizenship.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
statute
of
1865.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
there
was
a
conviction
--
it
was
interpreted
as
meaning
that
there
had
to
be
a
conviction
for
draft
evasion
or
desertion,
yes.
when
congress
came
in
1944
to
put
this
statute
into
the
books
and
made
a
change
and
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
go
back
just
a
little
bit
to
--
to
carry
on
the
history.
this
statute,
which
i
have
been
talking
about,
was
enacted
in
1865.
it
remained
on
the
books
until
1912.
it
provided
two
things
which
are
different
today.
it
did
not
require
that
a
man
leave
the
country
in
relation
to
draft
evasion.
any
draft
evader
lost
his
citizenship.
and
two,
it
did
provide
as
mr.
justice
douglas
has
pointed
out
that
there
must
be
a
conviction
or
at
least
it
was
interpreted
as
providing
that
there
must
be
a
conviction.
in
1912,
it
was
modified
so
as
to
apply
only
in
peace
time.
i
mean
not
to
apply
in
peace
time,
but
to
apply
only
in
time
of
war.
and
the
president
was,
at
the
same
time,
given,
specifically
given
the
power
to
pardon
for
previous
peace
time
desertions.
it
existed
during
world
war
ii
as
both
attorney
general
biddle
and
secretary
of
war
stimson
stated
in
letters
to
the
congress
in
the
--
in
1944.
and
in
--
in
fact
in
--
in
1924,
president
coolidge
saw
fit
to
proclaim
the
--
a
pardon
for
all
those
who
deserted
the
armies
in
world
war
ii
after
the
armies
--
before
the
formal
peace
there
was
a
period
between
november
11th,
1918
and
november
--
september,
i
think
1921,
when
there
was
technical
war
but
there
was
no
fighting.
and
in
1924,
president
coolidge
pardoned
these
persons
who
--
not
those
who
were
guilty
of
draft
evasion,
those
who
were
guilty
of
desertion.
well
anyway,
when
congress
came
in
1940
to
enact
the
1940
nationality
act
for
reasons
which
are
unknown,
it
did
not
carry
this
over.
it
carried
over
the
desertion
provision
of
the
1865
statute.
as
i
mentioned
that
statute
related
to
two
crimes,
desertion
and
draft
evasion.
congress
in
1940
carried
over
the
desertion
provision.
it
did
not
carry
over
the
draft
evasion
provision.
so
that
when
it
was
--
the
statute
was
enacted
in
1940
it
contained
no
provision
for
loss
of
nationality
by
reason
of
going
abroad
for
draft
evasion.
in
1944,
attorney
general
biddle
said
a
great
problem
had
arisen
in
that
respect.
there
were
several
hundred
people
who
were
believed
to
have
gone
to
mexico.
and
as
--
as
he
proposed
the
provision
which
is
now
section
401
(j)
--
subsection
(j).
it
was
unanimously
recommended
by
both
the
houses
of
--
by
both
the
committees
and
both
house
of
congress
and
was
unanimously
passed.
and
congress,
specifically,
did
not
wish
to
provide
that
there
have
to
be
a
conviction,
mr.
justice
douglas.
they
--
they
provided
instead
that
there
be
judicial
review
to
section
503
of
the
nationality
act.
that
is
court
review,
but
there
would
not
be
a
criminal
conviction.
and
the
reason
that
they
gave
was
that
most
of
these
people
would
stay
abroad
and
there
was
of
course
a
problem
too
of
--
of
statute
of
limitations.
the
only
tolling
provision
in
the
federal
statutes
of
limitation
is
for
someone
who
flees
from
justice.
and
there
is
not
--
it
is
not
clear
whether
a
person
who
stayed
abroad
for
a
long
time
would
be
fleeing
from
justice.
in
any
case,
congress
did
not
wish
to
provide
a
--
a
conviction
at
that
time
though
it
specifically
made
sure
that
there
would
be
de
novo
judicial
review
by
court
proceedings.
i've
been
in
some
ways
a
little
ahead
of
my
story
because
i
wanted
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
view
of
--
of
the
constitutional
power
which
we
propound
to
the
court
has
been
accepted
throughout
our
history.
i
mentioned
the
statutes.
there
were
treaties
in
the
--
in
the
latter
part
of
the
19th
century,
the
bancroft
treaties
and
other
treaties
which
also
provided
for
a
loss
of
nationality
by
--
by
a
naturalized
citizen
going
to
live
in
the
country
of
his
original
nativity
for
two
years
and
such
right.
there
were
bills
and
proposals
made,
most
of
them
not
adopted
throughout
the
19th
century.
there
were
studies
such
as
that
that
are
mentioned
by
secretary
of
state
hamilton
fish
by
the
citizenship
board
of
1906.
and
by
a
cabinet
committee
of
--
composed
of
--
of
secretary
of
state,
hull,
secretary
perkins
and
attorney
general
cummings
which
made
a
study
of
this
whole
matter
at
the
instance
of
president
roosevelt
from
about
1933
to
1938
and
proposed
what
was,
became
in
substance
the
nationality
act
of
1940.
all
these
committees
and
congress
by
its
own
action
indicated
that
it
believed
that
it
had
a
broad
power,
not
a
power
limited
as
it
has
been
suggested
to
the
acquisition
of
foreign
nationality
or
the
acquisition
of
another
allegiance.
this
court,
we
believe,
has
confirmed
the
breadth
of
that
power.
mackenzie
against
hare
has
been
mentioned.
i
have
read
to
the
court
the
words
of
justice
mckenna
which
indicated
that
in
his
view,
there
was
--
there
is
an
inherent
power
of
sovereignty
which
is
broad
and
which
the
court
should
hesitate
long
before
it
should
embarrass
or
limit.
the
other
cases
in
this
court
have
all
indicated
even
in
holding
that
there
was
no
expatriation,
that
congress
has
the
power.
in
the
famous
case
of
perkins
against
elg,
mr.
justice
--
chief
justice
hughes
was
very
careful
to
say,
"in
the
absence
of
treaty
or
statute."
he
said,
"in
the
absence
of
treaty
or
statute,
expatriation
must
be
voluntary.
it
cannot
be
accomplished
by
a
minor
abroad."
but
he
twice
said
in
the
absence
of
treaty
or
statute.
in
the
mandoli
case
in
--
three
years
ago,
mr.
justice
jackson
said
the
same
thing.
he
talked
about
voluntary
expatriation
or
involuntary
forfeiture
of
citizenship.
there
have
been
a
mass
of
lower
cases
--
lower
court
cases
in
this
figure
and
only
in
two
instances
has
there
been
any
responsible
suggestion
that
these
statutes
are
unconstitutional.
chief
judge
mclaughlin
in
the
district
of
hawaii
has
invalidated
most
of
these
provisions
of
the
1940
statute.
he
has
not
been
followed
by
his
own
court
of
appeals
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
--
or
by
any
other
court
with
the
exception
of
the
dissent
of
chief
justice
--
chief
judge
clark
in
the
trop
case.
that's
the
third
of
these
three
cases
which
is
to
be
argued,
which
is
the
only
other
indication
of
invalidity
which
--
which
exists.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
we
believe,
mr.
justice
black,
that
it
has
to
be
limited
by
the
objectives
for
which
the
power
exists
and
also
by
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
we
think
that
congress
has
the
right
to
take
into
account
two
general
sets
of
factors.
one
--
one
factor
are
--
are
those
which
deal
with
our
relations
with
foreign
countries,
any
--
a
matter
which
would
lead
to
embroilment
with
a
foreign
country,
a
matter
which
would
lead
to
a
conflict
of
allegiance
or
conflict
of
nationality
with
a
foreign
country.
then
we
also
think
that
congress
has
the
power
to
consider
acts,
activities
and
conduct
which
are
basically
inconsistent
with
the
cardinal
elements
of
american
citizenship.
a
man
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
larceny?
i
would
say
that
under
the
present
conditions,
that
is
not
a
cardinal
--
a
man
who
commits
larceny
is
not
violating
a
cardinal
obligation
of
american
citizenship.
draft
evasion
is
another
matter.
it
isn't
--
in
the
selected
draft
cases
in
1917,
the
chief
justice
then
said
it
was
the
highest
duty
of
the
citizen
to
respond
to
a
call
in
war
time.
and
--
and
of
course,
it
involves
embroilment
with
--
with
foreign
countries.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
to
foreign
affairs?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
cannot,
of
course,
give
a
categorical
answer,
mr.
justice
black,
because
in
each
case
there
will
be
before
congress
a
history,
an
experience
which
will
inform
congress
as
to
whether
it
should
adopt
the
particular
statute
or
--
or
not.
i
do
not
know
what
congress
would
have
before
it,
if
it
passed
such
a
statute.
all
i
would
say
is
that
each
statute
would
have
to
be
considered
by
this
court,
if
a
matter
came
to
this
court
with
relation
to
the
requirements
of
due
process,
to
the
requirements
of
reasonableness
in
the
situation
and
with
relation
to
the
--
to
the
power
of
congress,
as
in
the
power
of
congress
as
the
organ
of
our
country
in
the
--
in
the
world
of
nations
to
adopt
--
to
adopt
a
loss
of
nationality
provisions
comparable
to
those
which
other
countries
have.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
there
would
be
court
procedure.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh,
there
would
be
no
criminal
prosecution
except,
i
would
on
that
respect,
if
i
may
answer,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
would
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
other
case
which
is
not
being
heard,
the
mendoza-martinez
case,
there
was
a
conviction
for
draft
evasion
on
--
in
that
respect.
that's
not
true
here.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
may
i
answer
justice
clark's
question,
your
honor?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
footnote
on
page
22
of
our
brief.
thank
you.
