mr.
charles
a.
horsky
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
proceeding
hereon
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
by
which
the
petitioner
seeks
a
declaratory
judgment
that
he
is
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
the
district
court
denied
him
that
relief
and
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
both
courts
relied
upon
two
provisions
of
the
nationality
act
of
1940
as
amended
to
hold
that
although
he
had
once
been
a
citizen,
he
was
such
no
longer.
the
two
statutory
provisions
which
are
involved
are
each
subdivisions
of
section
401
of
the
nationality
act
of
1940.
the
first
relevant
one,
subsection
(e),
decrees
that
any
american
citizen,
whether
native-born
or
naturalized,
who
votes
in
any
foreign
political
election
or
plebiscite
shall
lose
his
american
citizenship.
the
second,
which
is
subsection
(j),
decrees
similar
consequences
for
any
citizen
native-born
or
naturalized
who
remains
outside
of
the
united
states
with
the
intention
of
avoiding
military
service.
the
petitioner
was
found
to
have
done
both
of
these
proscribed
acts.
that
finding
was
not
challenged
in
the
court
below
and
it
is
not
challenged
in
this
court.
the
only
issue
is
whether
those
two
subsections
are
within
the
constitutional
power
of
congress.
now,
briefly,
the
facts
--
the
remaining
facts
which
will
focus
that
constitutional
issue
are
as
follows.
the
petitioner
was
born
in
el
paso,
texas
in
1909.
he
lived
there
until
he
was
nine
or
ten
years
old
when
he
went
with
his
parents,
who
were
themselves
mexican
born,
back
to
mexico.
he
lived
there
raising
a
family,
marrying
a
mexican
national
in
1932
until
july
1943.
in
that
month,
and
again
a
little
later
in
1944,
he
twice
returned
to
the
united
states
to
work
as
a
railway
laborer.
in
each
instance,
claiming
falsely,
that
he
was
a
native-born
citizen
of
mexico.
he
had
known
that
he
was
a
native
--
that
he
was
born
in
the
united
states
earlier
than
that.
in
july
1947,
he
attempted
to
return
to
the
united
states
as
an
american
citizen.
the
immigration
authorities,
citing
against
him
the
same
two
acts
which
are
were
relied
upon
by
the
lower
courts
here,
held
that
he
had
lost
his
citizenship
and
excluded
him.
in
1952,
he
again
returned
to
the
united
states,
again
claiming
falsely,
to
have
been
a
native-born
mexican.
shortly
after
he
got
into
the
united
states,
he
surrendered
himself
to
the
immigration
authorities,
who
after
a
hearing,
ordered
him
deported
to
mexico.
it
is
to
review
that
administrative
order
that
these
present
judicial
proceedings
were
commenced.
the
case,
i
think,
thus
presents,
squarely,
the
issue
of
constitutional
power
of
congress
in
this
area.
stated
specifically,
the
issue
is
this,
may
congress
declare
that
a
native-born
american
citizen
shall
forfeit
that
citizenship
and
be
deported
from
the
united
states
if
he
votes
in
a
foreign
political
election
or
if
he
avoid
--
if
he
remains
out
of
the
united
states
to
avoid
military
service?
let
me
point
out
that
the
statutory
provisions
do
not
make
those
acts
merely
presumptive
of
an
intention
to
abandon
citizenship.
they
are,
in
all
circumstances
and
in
all
cases,
complete
acts
of
expatriation
unless
they
are
done
under
duress.
the
statute
also,
i
should
point
out,
does
not
purport
to
make
these
acts
for
this
--
this
forfeiture
a
criminal
penalty.
administrative
determinations
followed
by
the
type
of
civil
review
which
has
--
had
here
is
the
only
procedure
which
is
provided.
finally,
it
perhaps
is
worth
pointing
out
that
this
statute
does
not
require
that
the
citizen,
the
ex-citizen,
if
that
be
the
decision,
know
the
consequences
of
the
act
that
he
does.
there
is
no
finding
here
that
petitioner
knew
or
had
reason
to
know
that
by
the
acts
he
did,
he
was
forfeiting
his
american
citizenship.
we
believe
that
each
of
these
subsections
exceeds
the
power
which
is
vested
in
congress
by
the
constitution.
in
a
word,
we
believe
that
citizenship,
native-born
citizenship,
of
--
of
a
citizenship
acquired
by
birth
in
the
united
states
is
a
constitutional
right
which,
except
possibly
as
a
criminal
punishment
which
is
not
involved
here,
cannot
be
made
to
forfeit
for
the
doing
of
acts
such
as
these.
what
congress
can
do
under
the
constitution
is
to
provide
that
a
citizen,
a
native-born
citizen,
cannot
undertake
voluntarily
to
divide
his
allegiance
with
another
sovereign
state.
we
concede
that
that
is
well
within
the
--
the
constitutional
power
of
congress.
hence,
it
may
provide
as
it
has
done
in
subsections
(a)
and
subsections
(b)
of
section
401,
that
an
american
citizen,
native-born
or
naturalized,
who
takes
--
who
acquires
nationality
in
another
sovereign
state
or
who
takes
an
oath
of
allegiance
to
another
sovereign
state
forfeits
his
own
american
citizenship
whether
he
wants
to
or
not.
those
are
the
most
ancient
and
the
most
conclusive
expressions
of
intention
to
abandon
citizenship
as
this
court
has
noted.
and
in
order
to
avoid
or
minimize
the
international
complications
that
might
well
come
from
divided
allegiance
or
divided
responsibility,
we
agree
that
congress
may
declare
that
a
man
cannot
in
--
in
effect
have
two
masters
and
that
if
he
elects
a
new
one,
he
is
deemed
conclusively
to
have
agreed
to
abandon
the
old.
i
say
he
may,
because
congress
can
undoubtedly
decree
the
opposite.
it
need
not
require
that
it
may.
now,
let
me
try,
in
the
time
i
have,
to
answer
two
questions
which
i
think
are
the
basic.
first,
on
what
basis
can
it
be
said,
do
i
say,
that
that
is
the
limit
of
congressional
power
in
this
area?
and
second,
if
that
be
the
limit
of
congressional
power,
can
these
two
subsections
which
are
involved
be
sustained?
the
answer
to
the
first
question
which
is
the
limits
of
the
power
of
congress,
i
think
is
found
both
in
our
constitutional
history
and
in
the
decisions
of
this
court.
as
to
history,
the
most
significant
fact
is
that
this
power
was
not
exercised.
this
power
was
not
claimed
by
congress
for
over
150
years
after
the
constitution
was
adopted,
until
1940
to
be
precise.
that
is
not
to
say,
that
matters
of
citizenship
and
of
nationality
were
ignored
by
congress
during
that
150
years,
indeed
not.
we
fought
the
war
of
1812
in
a
large
part
to
assert
our
position
that
citizenship
in
other
countries
could
be
renounced
by
an
american
who
wished
to
be
nationalized
here.
after
a
long
debate
through
many
congresses,
we
declared
in
1868
a
right
of
expatriation,
an
american
citizen
who
wished
to
give
up
us
his
american
citizenship
was
conceded
the
right
to
do
it
by
act
of
congress
in
that
year.
we
passed
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
dealt
with
citizenship.
but
it
was
not
until
1940
that
congress
for
the
first
time
asserted
the
power
to
deprive
a
citizen,
a
native-born
citizen
of
his
citizenship,
of
his
constitutional
right
for
the
act
--
for
the
doing
of
some
act
which
did
not
involve
new
nationality
or
new
allegiance.
now,
perhaps,
it
isn't
quite
accurate
to
say
that
there
was
never
any
assertion
of
that
power
because
the
decision
--
the
statutes
involved
in
the
wong
kim
ark
case
in
the
169
united
states
were
not
entirely
dissimilar
from
that.
your
honors
will
recall
that
in
that
case,
congress
had
decreed
that
a
chinese
--
that
chinese
children,
children
of
persons
ineligible
to
become
citizens
of
the
united
states,
that
children
should
not
themselves
be
citizens
even
though
born
in
this
united
states
and
subject
to
its
jurisdiction.
this
court
held
that
congress
had
no
power
to
take
away
the
citizenship
of
those
children
by
act
--
by
act
of
congress.
the
government
urged
in
that
case
as
it
urges
here
that
it
must
be
of
the
essence
of
sovereignty
that
a
state
shall
have
the
power
to
determine
and
to
declare
who
are
its
citizens
and
who
are
not
its
citizens.
the
court
did
not
deny
that
power.
the
significant
fact,
however,
which
it
pointed
out
was
that
the
power
had
been
exercised
by
the
constitution,
that
it
was
a
constitutional
right
that
congress
had
determined
by
the
original
constitution
and
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
people
born
in
this
country
and
subject
to
its
jurisdiction
were
citizens.
the
united
states
has
decided,
not
by
statute
which
congress
can
change
but
by
the
constitution
which
congress
cannot
change,
who
are
citizens
of
this
country
and
who
are
not.
now,
the
teaching
of
the
wong
kim
ark
case
is,
as
we
see
it,
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
constitutional
right.
the
government,
however,
says,
“we
put
that
teaching
to
one
side
because
the
court
has
taught
us
something
else
in
mackenzie
against
hare
in
the
239
united
states.
indeed,
the
mackenzie
case,
i
think
i
can
fairly
say,
is
the
keystone
of
the
government's
argument
in
this
case,
and
i
think
it
therefore
warrants
our
careful
attention.
the
facts,
as
you
will
recall,
were
very
simple.
mrs.
mackenzie
married
a
citizen
of
great
britain
in
1909.
she
lived
in
california
before
her
marriage.
she
was
married
in
california
and
she
continued
to
live
in
california.
when
she
tried
to
vote
in
california,
she
was
told
that
she
had
--
her
citizenship
was
lost
by
reason
of
her
marriage
to
mr.
mackenzie,
a
citizen
of
great
britain.
and
congress
had
so
declared
in
the
1907
nationality
act.
it
had
declared
that
during
the
period
of
a
woman's
marriage
to
a
foreigner,
her
citizenship
was
in
effect
suspended.
that
could
be
resumed
on
her
--
on
the
dissolution
of
that
marriage.
but
during
the
period
of
her
marriage,
she
was
not
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
mrs.
mackenzie
claimed
that
the
act
was
either
inapplicable
or
invalid.
parenthetically,
i
should
add
that
that
act
survived
the
nineteenth
amendment
by
only
two
years.
it
was
repealed
in
1922.
this
court
held
that
the
1907
act,
however,
did
apply
to
mrs.
mackenzie,
notwithstanding,
her
continued
residence
in
california.
and
it
held
that
it
was
valid
and
that
she
had
in
effect
had
her
citizenship
in
this
country.
the
court
relied
first
on
the
ancient
principle
of
jurisprudence
that
merged
the
identity
of
husband
and
wife,
and
made
the
husband
the
dominant
part
of
that
merging.
that
being
true,
the
court
concluded,
the
marriage
of
an
american
woman
to
a
foreign
national
may
bring
the
government
of
the
united
states
into
embarrassments
and
controversies
with
foreign
nations
due
to
this
international
marriage.
and
therefore,
congress
could
provide
as
it
had
that
so
long
as
the
marriage
status
continued,
mrs.
mackenzie's
american
citizenship,
even
though
even
though
native-born,
was
in
effect
suspended.
the
power
of
congress
which
the
mackenzie
case
actually
sustains,
therefore,
is
the
power
which
we
do
not
dispute.
the
power
of
the
government
--
of
congress
to
declare
that
one
who
voluntarily
assumes
a
new
nationality
cannot
at
the
same
time
retain
the
old
nationality.
but
more
important,
i
think
even
than
that,
mr.
justice
mckenna,
who
wrote
the
opinion
in
mackenzie
against
hare,
seems
to
have
been
concerned,
lest,
the
decision
be
given
a
broader
sweep
than
he
had
intended
and
he
made
its
--
its
--
some
of
these
limitations
quite
explicit.
i'd
like
to
quote
just
about
four
lines
from
the
opinion.
he
says,
this
is
at
page
311
of
239
united
states,
"there
need
be
no
dissent
from
the
cases
cited
by
the
plaintiff,"
among
which
i
should
interpolate
wong
kim
ark
was
very
prominent.
this
one,
"there
need
be
no
assertion
of
very
extensive
power
over
the
right
of
citizenship
or
of
the
imperative
imposition
of
conditions
upon
it."
still
more
significant,
"it
may
be
conceded
that
a
change
of
citizenship
cannot
be
arbitrarily
imposed,
that
is,
imposed
without
the
concurrence
of
the
citizen."
the
law
in
controversy,"
the
justice
said,
"does
not
have
that
feature.
it
deals
with
a
condition
that's
voluntarily
entered
into,
with
notice
of
the
consequences."
i
take
it
that
those
limitations
in
that
opinion
have,
to
some
extent,
made
it
difficult
for
the
government
to
find
the
proper
way
in
which
to
attempt
to
justify
these
two
subdivisions
and
the
others
like
it
of
what,
which
you
will
hear
in
the
later
cases.
its
first
theory,
its
first
attempt
at
justification
of
these
subsections
was
to
argue
that
they
were
in
effect
presumptions.
that
congress
could
in
effect
enact
a
conclusive
presumption
that
the
doing
of
an
act,
such
as
voting
in
a
foreign
election,
was
a
voluntary
renunciation.
and
that
consequently,
it
was
done
with
the
concurrence
of
the
citizen
because
it
was
conclusively
presumed
to
be
with
his
concurrence.
that
theory,
of
course,
would
avoid
justice
mckenna's
statement.
it
would
avoid
or
perhaps
better,
evade
the
statement
of
chief
justice
hughes
in
perkins
against
elg
when
he
said
that
expatriation
is
the
voluntary
renunciation
or
abandonment
of
citizenship.
the
difficulty
with
the
theory,
however,
is
that
congress
by
that
is
in
effect
enacting
a
conclusive
presumption
of
the
waiver
of
a
constitutional
right.
and
that
seems
quite
clear
beyond
its
power
unless
it
is
perfectly
obvious
that
the
fact
presumed
and
the
fact
by
which
congress
enacts
followed
from
one
another.
perhaps,
it
is
for
that
reason
but
for
whatever
reason
it
may
be,
the
government
does
not
any
longer
urge
that
theory.
it
rather
in
this
case,
has
approached
it
on
the
theory
that
mr.
justice
mckenna
in
effect
is
wrong
and
that
chief
justice
hughes
in
effect
is
wrong.
and
that
congress
does
have
the
affirmative
substantive
power
to
take
away
citizenship
when
it
chooses
to
do
so,
simply
because
it
is
vested
with
the
attributes
of
sovereignty
and
that
citizenship
is
in
some
manner
related
to
the
sovereign
powers
of
the
united
states.
we
don't
deny
that
the
united
states
has
those
sovereign
powers,
but
we
say
it
does
not
follow
that
congress
may
exercise
those
powers
in
derogation
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
an
individual.
that,
it
seems
to
us,
is
established
directly
by
the
wong
kim
ark
decision.
we
find
full
play
for
the
principle
that
in
the
external
affairs
of
the
united
states,
congress
has
the
power
to
declare
whatever
is
necessary
to
avoid
embarrassments
and
controversies.
if
it
has
the
power
to
determine
as
i
said
earlier,
that
a
citizen
who
takes
on
a
new
nationality
or
a
citizen
who
swears
to
a
new
allegiance
cannot,
even
if
he
wishes
to,
retain
his
american
nationality
and
allegiance.
well,
let
me
pass
because
i
think
it
will
help
to
explain
what
i
am
saying
better
to
my
second
question.
if
that
is
the
scope
of
the
congressional
power,
can
these
subsections
be
sustained?
i
say,
i
think
it
will
help
illuminate
it
because
i
will
necessarily
be
talking
about
the
power
at
the
time
that
i
talk
about
the
subsections.
needless
to
say,
we
think
it
cannot.
indeed,
we
say
that
even
on
the
government's
theory
that
support
for
these
subsections
is
to
be
found
in
a
--
in
a
sovereign
power
over
international
affairs,
that
they
cannot
be
sustained.
the
government
makes
an
effort
to
show
that
these
--
each
of
these
subsections
is
a
matter
of
international
moment.
we
think
it's
perfectly
clear
that
they
are
not.
first,
let
me
take
up
subsection
(e),
voting
in
a
foreign
political
election
or
plebiscite,
that
is
all
that
is
required
to
forfeit
a
citizenship.
as
i
say,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
citizen
knew
whether
the
forfeiture
was
involved.
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
vote
was
about.
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
instances
in
which
the
vote
was
whether
beer
or
wine
should
be
sold
in
a
canadian
liquor
store
--
canadian
government
liquor
store,
citizenship
is
(inaudible)
we
have
a
case
in
which
citizens
voted
in
italian
elections
at
the
urging
of
american
representatives,
not
official,
don't
misunderstand.
but
at
the
urging
of
people
in
our
government
to
help
to
beat
the
communist,
citizenship
is
forfeited.
this
is
nothing
like
the
mackenzie
case
at
all.
one
who
votes
in
a
foreign
election
doesn't
necessarily
divide
his
nationality
or
his
allegiance,
certainly
not
in
all
cases
and
under
all
circumstances
as
is
provided
by
the
statute,
nor
do
i
believe
that
it
can
be
fairly
said
that
it
causes
international
complications.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
a
foreign
country
is
willing
to
let
an
american
citizen
vote
in
a
foreign
election,
in
its
election,
it
is
no
more
a
matter
of
international
complication
and
controversy
than
is
the
fact
that
many
american
states
did
and
some
still
do
permit
foreigners
to
vote
in
our
elections.
i
might
add
only
this.
this
is
the
only
country
in
the
world
that
makes
voting
in
a
foreign
election
a
cause
of
lost
of
citizenship.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
citizenship.
this
is
unique
among
the
statutes
of
the
world.
yes,
sir?
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
perhaps
i
misunderstood
your
question.
but
what
do
you
mean
by
throwing
in
his
lot
with
a
foreign
political
society?
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
you
do
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
i
--
i
agree,
your
honor,
except
that
i
would
say
two
things
about
it.
and
the
first
thing
i
would
say
is
that
mackenzie
against
hare
was
decided
a
long
time
ago,
1915
before
the
nineteenth
amendment,
before
a
great
many
other
things
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
[laughs]
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
i
suggest
that
in
terms
of
the
status
of
women,
it
is
quite
a
long
time
ago.
and
i
think
that
if
you
--
the
opinion
itself
reveals
the
postulates
upon
which
mr.
justice
mckenna
was
taking
his
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
right.
but
he
did
not
think
that
it
had
gone
to
the
point
where
it
is
today.
i'm
simply
suggesting,
your
honor,
that
were
mackenzie
against
hare
to
be
argued
today
with
exactly
the
same
statute,
i
very
much
doubt
that
this
court
would
reach
the
same
conclusion.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
i
am
--
i
hope
that
i
am
not
thinking
as
urging
you
to
endorse
mackenzie
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
against
hare.
i
agree
that
i
do
not
wish
to
try
and
take
on
mackenzie
against
hare
if
it
is
unnecessary
to
do
so.
but
i
do
say,
as
i
have
just
said
to
you,
that
if
mackenzie
against
hare
were
to
come
up
again
today,
i
think
it
would
be
quite
likely
that
it
would
read
--
it
would
be
decided
the
other
way.
may
i
also
point
out,
your
honor,
that
in
mackenzie
against
hare
there
was
not
a
forfeiture
of
citizenship.there
was
a
suspension
of
citizenship.
mrs.
mackenzie
could
get
her
citizenship
back.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
or
if
her
husband
died.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
it
--
it
was
within
her
power
at
any
rate
to
get
it
back,
it
is
not
--
these
are
not
within
the
power
of
mr.
perez.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
no,
i
--
well,
i
don't
know
whether
we
could
or
not,
i
doubt
it
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
[laughs]
well,
let
me
--
let
me
add
one
thing
before
i
come
to
the
part
of
the
statute
which
seems
to
bother
you
the
most.
i'd
like
to
add
one
more
about
this
matter
of
voting.
and
that
is
to
refer
you
briefly
to
the
reason
why
that
provision
is
in
the
statutes,
something
of
its
history.
i
think
it
will
indicate
to
you
that
it
does
not
have
any
relationship,
in
fact,
to
the
problem
of
international
complications
or
international
external
affairs.
in
1935,
congress
was
very
much
exercised,
was
displeased
with
the
conduct
of
certain
americans
who
were
taking
an
active
part
in
the
nazi
government
of
germany,
to
some
extent
in
the
fatuous
government
of
italy,
and
particularly
with
a
great
migration
of
americans
to
vote
and
desire
plebiscite
in
january
1935.
in
february
1935,
a
bill
was
introduced
in
congress
and
reported
favorably
by
the
committee
on
immigration
and
naturalization
which
explains
--
which
was
in
--
practically
identical
in
substance
with
the
present
subsection
(e).
and
the
committee
explained
that
its
purpose
was
to
provide
a
penalty
of
loss
of
citizenship
for
anyone
who
thereafter
voted
in
a
foreign
election.
that
bill
didn't
become
a
law
but
it
did
become
a
part
of
the
1940
act.
15
years
later,
in
explaining
this
same
history
to
the
congress
which
i
have
just
explained,
the
judiciary
committee
of
the
house
said
that
it
agreed
and
i
quote,
the
purpose
of
subsection
(e)
was
to
serve
notice
and
i
quote,
“citizenship
does
not
carry
with
it
any
loophole
through
which
voting
in
foreign
states
may
be
done
without
penalty.”
there
is
no
doubt
that
congress
does
not
regard
with
favor
americans
voting
in
foreign
elections.
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
that
there
is
no
way
in
which
congress
can
make
that
pleasure
effective.
but
i
do
say
is
that
it
cannot
make
it
effective
by
decreeing
the
loss
of
a
constitutional
right
for
the
doing
of
that
act.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
right.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i
--
i
do
--
i
do
rest
it
in
connection
with
subsection
(j)
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
that
it
is
not
--
he
doesn't
have
the
protections
of
the
criminal
law
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
i
--
i
do
not,
your
honor.
principally,
because
although
perhaps
inaccurately,
i
have
assumed
that
this
judicial
proceeding
which
is
available
to
review
the
administrative
decision
made
by
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
suffices
if
a
civil
proceeding
will
suffice.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
he
was
in
1947.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
he
got
--
he
came
in
1952.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
he
is
now
to
be
deported.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
right.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
he
has
had
it,
your
honor,
in
this
proceeding.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
before
a
judge
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
except
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
right.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
i'd
--
i'm
not
--
i
frankly
cannot
answer
that
question,
i'd
have
to
guess.
but
that
is
not
this
case.
i
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
in
--
in
this
case,
the
man
is
in
fact
in
the
country,
has
had
a
hearing
before
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
and
then
has
appealed
to
the
courts
to
review
that
determination
under
the
declaratory
judgment
act
in
the
appropriate
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
de
novo.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i
believe
it
was
de
novo,
is
it
not?
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i
--
i
would
not
like
to
answer
that
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
right.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
right.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
right,
it
does
not.
it
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
this
man
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
then
certainly
it
should
not
be
overlooked
in
this
case,
your
honor,
that
this
man
is
subject
to
a
deportation
order.
and
if
the
government
is
correct,
the
doing
of
these
two
acts
will
result
in
his
banishment
from
the
united
states.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
now,
just
one
word
before
i
close
on
subsection
(j),
remaining
out
of
the
country
to
avoid
military
service.
in
this
case,
congress
has
specified
that
a
criminal
act,
draft
evasion,
which
carries
heavy
criminal
penalties
in
this
country
shall
be
punished
still
further
by
the
loss
of
citizenship.
this
seems
to
me
even
farther
from
mackenzie
against
hare.
the
act
that
we're
talking
about
now
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
acquisition
of
a
new
nationality
or
a
new
allegiance.
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
draft
evaders
have
a
higher
regard
for
their
civic
responsibilities,
clearly
not,
but
the
same
could
no
doubt
be
said
for
others
who
leave
the
united
states
to
avoid
the
consequences
of
criminal
acts.
but
here,
my
point
is
that
there
is
clear
evidence
that
congress
has
undertaken
to
impose
a
criminal
penalty
without
the
time
for
--
without
affording
the
safeguards
of
the
criminal
law.
we
have
outlined
that
in
the
point
3
of
our
brief.
i
will
not,
i
see,
have
time
to
elaborate
it
here.
i
call
it
to
your
attention
only
to
say
that
even
on
the
government's
theory
and
quite
apart
from
the
arguments
i
have
made
on
mackenzie
against
hare,
we
think
that
subsection
must
fall.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
may
it
please
the
court.
this
proceeding
is
here
on
reargument
pursuant
to
the
order
of
the
court
entered
at
the
close
of
the
last
term.
since
that
order
did
not
direct
counsel
to
any
particular
matters,
i
am
assuming
that
a
full
discussion
of
the
issues
is
again
appropriate.
perhaps
i
should
say
by
way
of
brief
preliminary
that
following
the
order
of
the
court
last
june,
i
reexamined
the
briefs
--
the
brief
and
the
reply
brief
filed
for
the
petitioner
in
the
last
--
at
the
last
session,
and
i
concluded
that
no
further
brief
was
necessary.
the
government,
however,
has
filed
a
supplemental
memorandum
which
is
applicable
not
only
to
this
case
but
also
to
the
--
to
succeeding
cases.
as
a
preliminary,
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
if
i
restate
--
recall
to
your
minds
the
facts
in
this
case.
i
would
not
presume
to
do
it
but
they're
very
short,
and
i
think
it
would
be
well
under
the
circumstances.
the
proceeding
is
an
action
for
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
petitioner
is
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
the
district
court
denied
petitioner
that
relief
and
adjudged
that
he
was
not
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
that
decision
was
affirmed
by
the
court
below
which
is
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
in
each
of
the
two
courts,
two
provisions
of
the
nationality
act
of
1940,
as
amended,
were
held
to
have
taken
away
the
american
citizenship
which
the
petitioner
admittedly
once
had.
the
first
provision
is
subsection
(e)
of
section
401,
which
decrees
that
any
american
citizen,
whether
native-born
or
naturalized
who
votes
in
a
foreign
political
election
or
plebiscite,
shall
lose
his
american
citizenship.
the
second
provision
which
is
subsection
(j)
of
the
same
section
401
decrees
a
like
faith
for
any
citizen,
native-born
or
naturalized
who
remains
outside
of
or
flees
the
united
states
to
avoid
military
service.
your
honors
will
recall
that
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
was
found
to
have
done
both
of
those
things.
those
findings
were
not
challenged
in
the
court
below
and
they
are
not
challenged
here.
the
issue
here
is
solely
the
question
whether
those
subsections
are
within
the
constitutional
power
of
congress.
now,
the
facts
can
also
be
stated
briefly
which
bring
that
issue,
perhaps,
into
a
little
more
clear
focus.
the
petitioner
was
born
in
el
paso,
texas
in
1909.
at
the
age
of
about
10,
he
was
taken
by
his
parents
to
mexico.
he
stayed
there
until
he
attained
his
majority.
he
married
a
mexican
and
he
has
raised
a
family.
there
is
no
finding,
however,
that
he
is
or
ever
was
a
citizen
of
mexico.
he
returned
to
the
united
states
for
the
first
time
in
july
1943
and
again,
in
july
19
--
in
early
1944.
both
time
working
for
a
few
months
as
a
railway
laborer.
each
time,
he
claimed
falsely
to
have
been
a
native-born
mexican.
in
july
1947,
however,
he
attempted
to
enter
the
united
states
as
an
american
citizen.
the
immigration
authorities
citing
against
him
the
same
two
sections
that
are
involved
in
this
proceeding
held
that
he
had
forfeited
his
american
citizenship
and
refused
him
entry.
in
1952,
he
again
returned
to
the
united
states,
again,
by
claiming
falsely
to
be
a
native-born
mexican.
shortly
after
he
arrived
this
last
time,
he
surrendered
to
the
immigration
authorities
who,
following
their
earlier
decision,
held
that
he
had
forfeited
his
citizenship
and
again
ordered
him
deported.
that
deportation
order
has
been
stayed
by
the
court
in
the
present
case
which
was
brought
shortly
after
the
deportation
order
was
entered.
the
question
at
issue
then
is
simply
this,
does
congress
have
the
power
under
the
constitution
to
declare
that
native-born
citizenship
shall
be
--
shall
be
forfeited
if
a
citizen
votes
in
a
foreign
political
election
or
remains
outside
of
united
states
to
avoid
military
service.
those
two
sections
are
the
ones
involved
in
this
case.
before
i
proceed
to
discuss
that
issue,
i'd
like,
however,
to
have
a
--
make
a
few
comments
on
the
nature
of
the
statute
with
which
we
are
concerned.
it
has
several
features
that
are
important.
first,
it
doesn't
make
as
--
the
doing
of
the
acts
which
petitioner
has
found
to
--
was
found
to
have
done,
presumptive
merely
of
an
intention
to
abandon
citizenship
or
to
forfeit
citizenship.
these
acts
are,
in
all
cases,
irrespective
of
circumstances
and
motives
when
not
done
under
duress
conclusive
acts
of
forfeiture.
second,
and
by
the
same
token,
the
citizen
need
not
know
and
the
petitioner
here
did
not
know
that
the
acts
--
the
doing
of
these
acts
will
entail
this
enormous
forfeit.
there
is
no
finding
here
that
petitioner
was
aware
of
the
consequences
of
what
he
did
and
the
statute
does
not
require
any
such
finding.
finally,
the
statute
does
not
purport
to
impose
this
forfeiture
as
a
criminal
penalty.
the
loss
of
citizenship
is
a
matter
for
administrative
determination.
sometimes,
as
in
the
present
case,
it
is
possible
to
obtain
judicial
review
of
the
action
in
a
civil
action
such
as
this
one.
but
in
many
cases
where
the
acts
alleged
to
forfeit
the
citizenship
are
performed
outside
the
united
states,
there
is
grave
doubt
at
least
as
to
whether
there
is
any
judicial
review
of
the
administrative
determination
that
citizenship
has
been
forfeited.
what
is
certain,
however,
is
that
there
is
no
intention.
there
is
no
policy
in
this
statute
to
treat
this
as
a
criminal
punishment
imposed
only
after
the
protections
afforded
by
the
constitution
for
--
for
a
criminal
action.
the
petitioner
has
no
trial
by
jury.
he
cannot
even
urge
that
the
punishment
would
be
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
under
the
eighth
amendment.
the
administrative
procedure
which
is
involved
here,
neatly
sidesteps
all
of
these
constitutional
guarantees.
we
believe
that
these
subsections,
and
each
of
them
i
can
treat
together
for
a
moment
and
then
i
will
come
to
them
separately,
exceed
the
power
vested
in
congress
by
the
constitution.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
i
assume,
your
honor,
that
if
either
of
them
is
constitutional,
the
decision
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
below
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
i'm
not
sure
then
that
i
understand
it,
your
honor.
if
you
mean
that
if
congress
had
passed
only
one
of
them,
it
would
have
been
unconstitutional
but
since
it
passed
two,
it
was
acting
constitutionally.
i
don't
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i
don't
understand
it
that
way.[laughs]
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
i
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
(e)
and
(j),
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
(e)
and
(j)
are
the
two
that
are
here
involved.
well,
i
think
i
can
answer
the
second
part
of
your
question
more
easily
than
the
first.
i
think
that
under
the
second
part,
if,
as
i've
said
before,
if
either
of
the
subsections,
he
is
held
valid
and
constitutional
there
is
an
adequate
basis
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
for
the
decision
below.
that's
easy.
the
first
part
of
the
question,
i
am
not
sure
that
i
still
fully
understand
and
i
hesitate
therefore
to
attempt
to
answer
it.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i
think
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
i
--
i
think
understanding
it
now,
as
i
do,
i
believe
i
would
say
that
the
statute
would
still
clearly
be
unconstitutional
on
my
argument,
and
i
will
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i
think
not,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i
think
not.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
[laughs]
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
let
me,
however,
in
order
to
get
into
the
discussion
of
this
question,
tell
--
cite
in
a
few
words
as
i
can
what
i
think
the
powers
of
congress
are
in
this
area
of
citizenship
and
then
attempt
to
define
more
precisely
why
i
think
the
powers
here
attempted
are
not
within
congressional
authority.
in
the
first
place,
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
congress
has
the
power,
and
indeed,
it
has
purported
to
exercise
the
power
to
declare
a
right
of
voluntary
expatriation.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
--
under
our
constitution
which
permits
--
authorizes
the
naturalization
of
foreigners
who
wish
to
become
citizens
of
this
country.
it
is
almost
incumbent
upon
us
to
recognize
a
correlative
right
of
american
citizens
to
renounce
voluntarily
this
citizenship
if
they
wish
to
become
citizens
of
a
foreign
country.
congress
may
also
provide,
i
am
clear,
as
it
did
in
1907,
a
half
century
ago
that
a
citizen
may
not
undertake
to
divide
his
allegiance
between
this
country
and
some
foreign
state.
i'd
like
to
state
that
principle
in
terms
--
in
the
terms
with
which
it
was
stated
by
the
citizenship
board
of
1906.
and
i've
--
it's
a
brief
sentence
but
it
seems
to
me
to
summarize
the
point.
the
board
said,
"no
man
should
be
permitted
deliberately
to
place
himself
in
a
position
where
his
services
may
be
claimed
by
more
than
one
government
and
his
allegiance
be
due
more
than
one
government."
this
principle
is
reflected
in
section
401,
in
subsections
(a)
and
(b)
which
provide
that
naturalization
in
a
foreign
state
or
the
taking
of
an
oath
of
allegiance
to
a
foreign
state
are
acts
of
expatriation.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
those
--
well,
let
me
--
let
me
clarify
it.
if
a
person
who,
let
us
say,
becomes
naturalized
in
italy,
an
american
citizen
takes
out
an
italian
citizenship
says,
"i
didn't
intend
by
that
act
to
devour
then
give
up
half
of
my
allegiance
to
united
states
and
give
half
to
italy.
i
think
it's
quite
proper
to
reply
that
allegiance
can't
be
divided
that
way.if
you
dilute
it,
you
destroy
it.
if
that
be
involuntary
in
that
sense,
yes.
i
think
also
if
a
person
were
to
say
by
taking
out
italian
citizenship
and
taking
an
oath
of
allegiance
to
italy,
i
didn't
intend
to
give
up
any
of
my
allegiance
to
america.
i
didn't
intend
to
give
any
allegiance
to
italy.
i
think
you
can
say
as
you
did
in
the
savorgnan
in
effect.
you
can't
sign
one
thing
and
claim
another
even
assuming
that
you
didn't
believe
that
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
that
happens.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
no,
sir.
i
say
that
the
power
in
congress
is
a
power
to
define
how
you
voluntarily
waive
your
citizenship.
i
don't
recognize
a
right
in
a
one
person
to
sign
a
paper
which
says,
i
am
now
giving
my
allegiance
to
italy
and
then
come
in
six
months
later
and
say,
“i
didn't
mean
it.”
if
that
is
involuntary,
perhaps
i
mean
that
but
i
don't
regard
that
as
involuntary
expatriation.
that
is
doing
something
which
divides
the
man's
allegiance
which
gives
him
a
new
nationality
and
he
is
simply
claiming
that
he
didn't
do
what
he
did
and
i
think
that
is
not
involuntary
expatriation.
i
don't
regard
those
sections
as
anything
more
than
a
definition
by
congress
of
how
you
voluntarily
can
expatriate
yourself.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
if
--
if
it's
necessary
to
do
that,
i
--
i
would
like
to
have
you
do
it.i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
it.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i
don't
believe
those
sections
properly
construed
can
ever
result
in
involuntary
expatriation
any
more
so
than
subsections
--
let's
take
subsection
(i)
which
is
renouncing
american
citizenship
by
an
oath
before
some
appropriate
official.
a
man
can
come
and
say,
“i
didn't
intend
to
do
anything
by
it.”
but
that
certainly
isn't
involuntary
expatriation
when
you
say,
“well,
i
believe
your
oath
but
i
don't
believe
you
now,”
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
or
i'm
not
going
to
listen
what
you
have
in
your
mind
at
the
time.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
i
don't
then
know
what
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
what
documents
did
she
sign?
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
what
documents
does
she
sign?
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
an
oath
of
allegiance?
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
i
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
i
--
i
think
it
--
it
ought
to
be
clear
that
when
i
say
voluntary
or
when
i'm
talking
about
taking
an
oath
of
allegiance,
that
i
am
talking
about
taking
an
oath
of
allegiance
irrespective
of
mental
reservation,
and
i
don't
believe
that
mental
reservations
ought
to
have
any
place
in
this.
and
i
don't
think
that
if
that
means
that
we've
got
to
be
semantic
about
what
is
voluntary,
i
--
i
don't
think
it
ought
to
turn
on
those
terms.
but
i
think
this
is
quite
a
different
kind
of
a
matter.
and
if
i
may
have
--
i
don't
mean
to
--
let
me
go
on
to
what
i
think
the
situation
is
here.
in
this
case,
the
important
element
in
both
of
these
subsections,
and
i
could
still
generalize
them
together,
is
that
the
action
taken
by
petitioner
had
nothing
to
do
with
foreign
nationality.
voting
is
defined
in
subsection
(e)
as
just
plain
voting,
pure
and
simple.
it
does
not
require
that
he'd
take
an
oath
of
allegiance
or
have
any
nationality
in
a
foreign
state.
leaving
the
country
or
in
this
case,
staying
out
of
the
country
to
avoid
military
service,
gave
him
no
other
citizenship.
it
operates
in
both
of
these
subsections
to
leave
the
man
a
stateless
person
if
it
--
if
he
happens
to
be
a
dual
national
or
not.
if
he
is
not
a
dual
national,
that's
just
too
bad.
he
therefore
has
no
--
no
nationality
at
all.
now,
the
--
the
basis
for
my
argument
and
perhaps
that
will
help
to
clarify
this
matter
of
voluntariness,
lies
in
two
areas.
the
first
is
our
constitutional
history
and
the
second
is
the
decisions
of
this
court.
the
constitutional
history,
i
can
skip
over
very
quickly.
the
fact
is
that
this
power,
as
i
see
it,
was
not
asserted
for
150
years
after
the
constitution
began.
there
was
plenty
of
controversy
about
citizenship.
there
was
the
war
of
1812
about
the
right
of
people
to
become
american
citizens
and
cast
off
their
foreign
allegiance.
it
was
the
problems
of
the
right
of
expatriation
which
was
finally
solved
by
congress
in
1868
by
a
declaration
of
that
right.
they
were
the
problems
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
but
it
was
not
until
1940
when
voting
in
a
foreign
political
election
was
first
made
an
act
of
expatriation
that
the
kind
of
a
power
which
is
not
asserted
for
congress
was
first
asserted.
now,
in
the
decisions
of
the
--
of
this
court,
i
think
that
i
find
support
for
the
proposition
that
it
requires
that
the
power
of
congress
is
limited
to
defining
what
will
be
voluntary
expatriation,
that
there
is
no
power
of
involuntary
expatriation
taken
without
the
concurrence
of
the
citizen.
the
first
case
is
wong
kim
ark
against
the
united
states.
there,
it
was
claimed,
as
you
will
recall,
that
wong
was
born
in
san
francisco
of
chinese
parents
ineligible
to
citizenship
was
not
a
citizen
and
that
therefore,
he
should
be
denied
admission
to
the
united
states
when
he
went
on
a
visit
to
china
--
readmission
to
united
states.
this
court
ordered
wong
re-admittance.
it
rejected
the
view
that
what
congress
could
do
by
way
of
naturalization
or
failure
to
make
naturalization
available
to
wong's
parents
could
affect
wong's
citizenship.
and
if
i
may
use
justice
gray's
specific
words,
he
said,
"no
act
or
omission
of
congress,
as
to
providing
for
the
naturalization
of
parents
or
children
of
a
particular
race,
can
affect
citizenship
acquired
as
a
birthright
by
virtue
of
the
constitution
itself
without
any
act
of
legislation."
i
read
wong
kim
ark
as
teaching
that
when
we
are
dealing
with
native-born
citizenship,
we're
dealing
with
a
constitutional
right
not
subject
to
the
power
of
congress
to
take
away
or
to
control.
now,
the
government
would
find
that
teaching
put
to
one
side
or
overruled
by
the
decision
in
mackenzie
against
hare,
and
i'd
like
to
take
some
time
on
that
case.
mrs.
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
i
think
it
is
possible,
mr.
justice,
that
citizenship
may
be
taken
away
as
a
punishment
for
a
crime
after
a
criminal
conviction.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
no
act
or
omission
of
congress
can
affect
citizenship
acquired
as
a
birthright
by
virtue
of
the
constitution
itself.
all
that
says
is
that
congress
can't
take
this
citizenship
and
do
with
it
as
it
sees
fit.
this
is
a
constitutional
right
like
the
right
to
trial
by
jury.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i
don't
think
treason
would
have
anything
to
do
with
it.
it
still
--
a
man
would
still
be
a
citizen
even
if
he
commits
treason.
congress
might
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
congress
might
provide,
i
am
willing
to
say
although
i
--
it
raises
some
other
questions
which
are
apparent.
congress
might
have
the
power
to
say
that
as
a
punishment
for
treason
upon
conviction
thereof
under
the
due
processes
of
criminal
law
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
then
it
cannot
do
it.
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
congress
has
the
right
administratively
by
legislative
if
i
have
to
say,
‘you
are
no
longer
worthy
of
citizenship.”
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
you
can
go
into
court
in
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i
know,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i
appreciate
that.
but
you'd
go
into
a
civil
court
and
you
have
a
finding
of
fact
as
you
do
here
that
whether
or
not
you
committed
treason,
and
i
don't
think
that
is
sufficient.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i
say
that
cannot
be
done,
yes.
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
yes.
now,
let
me
--
let
me
deal
with
mackenzie
against
hare.
mrs.
mackenzie,
you
may
remember
the
facts,
i'm
about
to
make
a
statement
and
let
me
state
it
very
briefly,
mrs.
mackenzie
married
her
husband,
a
british
citizen
and
subject
in
california
in
1909.
she
had
always
lived
there.
she
was
married
there.
she
continued
to
live
there.
but
in
1913
she
tried
to
vote
and
the
registrar
said
that
she
was
no
longer
a
citizen
because
she
had
married
a
british
subject
and
become
a
british
citizen.
mrs.
mackenzie
claimed
that
that
statute,
and
that
was
the
act
of
1907,
that
was
one
of
the
subsections,
was
unconstitutional.
this
court
said
it
was
not.
this
court
cited
what
it
called
the
ancient
principle
of
jurisprudence
that
a
husband
and
wife
in
public
affairs
were
merged
and
the
husband
was
the
dominant
feature.
and
the
respondent
in
that
case
had
pointed
out
as
--
so
far
as
i
know
was
true,
that
in
every
country
at
that
time,
marriage
of
a
woman
to
a
foreigner
gave
her
the
nationality
of
her
husband.
viewing
the
matter
in
that
light,
the
court
said
that
there
needn't
be
any
dissent
from
the
doctrine
stated
in
the
wong
kim
ark
case,
which
mrs.
--
mrs.
mackenzie
had
cited
and
relied
upon.
and
then
the
court
said,
"it
may
be
conceded
that
a
change
of
citizenship
cannot
be
arbitrarily
imposed,
that
is,
imposed
without
the
concurrence
of
the
citizen.
the
law
in
controversy
does
not
have
that
feature.
it
deals
with
a
condition
voluntarily
entered
into
with
notice
of
the
consequences."
in
other
words,
as
the
court
saw
it
in
the
light
of
the
then
current
concepts
of
husband
and
wife,
mrs.
mackenzie's
act
of
marriage
to
her
husband
by
which
she
became
a
british
citizen
was
tantamount
to
naturalization
in
the
british
empire.
whether
the
issue
will
be
decided
the
same
way
today,
it
is
doubtful.
it
will
--
it
will
not
come
up
because
congress
itself,
two
years
after
the
nineteenth
amendment
repealed
that
section
of
the
1907
act
and
it
has
not
been
reinstated
in
the
1940
act.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i
regard
the
case
of
mackenzie
and
hare
as
a
case
of
voluntary
expatriation,
that's
right.
just
about
like
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
just
about
like
savorgnan.
in
savorgnan,
mrs.
savorgnan
took
an
oath
of
allegiance
to
italy
and
signed
all
the
papers
making
her
a
citizen
of
italy.
the
case
wouldn't
have
--
wouldn't
be
any
problem
at
all
except
that
she
managed
to
persuade
the
district
court
to
find
that
she
didn't
intend
by
that
to
do
anything
to
her
american
citizenship.
now,
assuming
that
that
was
believable,
i
think
this
court
properly
held
it
irrelevant
in
view
of
what
she
had
done.
as
i
say,
i
don't
think
you
can
divide
or
dilute
your
allegiance
by
doing
the
obvious
thing
which
would
give
you
another
citizenship
and
would
abandon
your
american
citizenship
and
then
say,
“i
didn't
mean
it,”
when
it's
--
when
some
of
the
unfortunate
or
unhappy
consequences
begin
to
dawn
on
you,
and
that's
what
mrs.
savorgnan
did.
now,
i
might
also
point
out
as
one
last
item
of
reference
that
as
late
as
last
may,
this
court,
in
rabang
against
boyd,
did
refer
in
somewhat
a
language
reminiscent
of
wong
kim
ark
to
the
constitutionally
secured
birthright
of
citizenship
acquired
by
the
american-born
in
distinguishing
it
from
the
nationality
which
it
held
there
not
subject
to
--
to
constitutional
protection.
now,
let
me
turn,
if
i
may,
from
these
general
considerations
to
consideration
of
these
two
specific
sections
taken
separately.
i
think
if
we
do,
i
can
make
more
clear
the
suite
of
the
power
which
is
here
asserted
for
congress.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
certainly
with
respect
to
naturalized
citizens
who
are
naturalized
after
a
law
is
in
effect
which
puts
conditions
on
it,
i
suppose
that
congress
can
condition
naturalization
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
as
it
sees
fit.
i
would
not
draw
any
distinction
between
a
natural
born
citizen
and
a
--
and
a
naturalized
citizen
who
obtained
his
citizenship
before
those
conditions
were
imposed.
is
that
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
sufficient?
first,
let
me
talk
to
subsection
(e).
this
is
voting
in
a
foreign
political
election
or
plebiscite.
that's
all.
under
this
subsection,
as
i've
said,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
citizen
knew
that
there
was
any
such
terrible
penalty
imposed
and
there
is
no
finding
here
to
this
petition
here.
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
election
was
about.
this
subsection
has
been
applied,
as
i
point
out
in
my
brief,
to
--
take
away
the
american
citizenship
of
a
person
who
votes
in
canada
on
a
local
election
as
--
as
to
whether
state
liquor
store
should
sell
beer
and
wine.
it
has
been
applied
to
take
away
the
citizenship
of
a
great
many
people
who
voted
with
the
urging
and
the
--
the
pressure
from
america
against
the
communists
in
italian
elections
and
elections
other
--
and
other
places
on
the
continent.
it
is
applied
automatically.
it
doesn't
allow
any
leeway.
it's
been
applied
automatically
here.
there
is
no
finding
as
to
why
or
how
or
under
what
circumstances
the
petitioner
voted.
that's
irrelevant.
and
as
i
pointed
out
earlier,
this
section
does
not
have
anything
to
do
with
acquiring
a
citizenship
in
or
evidencing
any
allegiance
to
a
foreign
government.
this
is
just
plain
voting
and
a
statelessness
result,
that's
too
bad.
now,
in
the
brief
for
the
united
states,
the
government
attempts
to
sustain
this
subsection
by
this
statement.
it
says
it's
warranted
"to
avoid
international
conflicts
and
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
american
political
processes
and
the
singleness
of
american
allegiance,
i
submit
that
that
is
just
no
more
than
words.
if
a
foreign
state
permits
aliens
to
vote,
i
can
see
no
basis
upon
which
you'll
have
international
conflict
any
more
than
there
had
been
international
conflicts
when
states
in
united
states,
as
they
did
and
some
still
do,
permit
aliens
to
vote
here.
when
we
go
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
american
political
processes
in
this
context,
i
simply
don't
understand
what
it
--
what
it's
talking
about.
but
i
do
know
that
there
is
no
necessary
impairment
of
the
singleness
of
american
allegiance
in
voting
in
a
foreign
election
and
certainly
not
in
every
circumstance
at
--
at
all
times.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
i
--
that
particular
case,
i
can't
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
speak
to
it
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
specifically
but
i
think
the
answer
would
be
clearly
yes.
i
don't
have
any
doubt
but
that
is
a
political
--
foreign
political
election.
the
one
that
i
mentioned
is
a
case
in
which
the
--
the
local
question
on
the
local
ballot
was
“shall
the
state
liquor
store
sell
beer
and
wine?”
the
lady
voted
--
i
don't
know
which
way
[laughs].
and
she
lost
her
citizenship.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
this
is
a
decision
by
the
attorney
general
in
this
particular
case
with
a
dissent
in
the
natural
--
in
the
board
of
naturalization
but
the
attorney
general
holding,
quite
recently,
that
this
foster
citizenship.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
yes,
i
--
i
think
i
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
i
think
i
can,
and
i'd
like
to
come
to
that.
i
think
the
reason
advanced
by
the
government
which
i
have
just
quoted
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
processes
and
the
like
is
an
afterthought
and
a
--
make
way
in
an
attempt
to
avoid
what
the
section
really
is
which
is
an
attempt
by
congress
to
punish
conduct
it
doesn't
like.
the
origin
of
subsection
(e)
is
this.
in
1935,
there
was
a
great
deal
of
unhappiness,
let
me
say,
in
congress
about
the
activities
of
certain
americans
who
were
interested
in
the
nazi
government
in
germany
and
the
fascist
government
in
italy
and
there
was
a
particular
unhappiness
about
the
fact
that
some
americans
have
voted
and
desire
plebiscite.
the
result
was
that
the
committee
on
immigration
and
naturalization
of
the
house
in
1935
reported
out
favorably
a
bill
in
practically
the
identical
language
of
subsection
(e)
making
it
a
forfeiture
of
citizenship
to
vote
in
a
foreign
political
election
or
plebiscite
because
the
plebiscite
bizarre
was
very
much
in
the
forefront
of
their
mind.
the
committee
explained
that
its
--
the
purpose
of
the
bill
was
to
provide
a
penalty,
and
the
word
“penalty”
is
used
by
the
committee,
for
anyone
who
thereafter
voted
in
a
foreign
election.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
foreign
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
it
was
in
the
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
it
was
in
the
same
word
as
it
is
now.
that
bill
did
not
become
law,
your
honor.
it
--
it
was
put
in
in
1940
when
the
--
the
committee
revised
the
whole
nationality
act
and
they
picked
up
some
of
the
proposals
that
had
been
pending
in
congress
up
to
that
time
and
put
in
in
this
long
draft
of
section
401.
but
1935
bill
was
in
practically
the
same
words
as
the
present
subsection
(e)
and
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
plebiscite.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i
couldn't
speak
to
that
but
i
would
be
very
surprised
if
it
did.
i
--
i
don't
think
so
but
i
--
i
really
don't
--
i
have
never
looked
at
it
with
that
particular
question
in
mind.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i
think
that
--
well,
the
attorney
general
clearly
considers
it
as
aimed
in
--
at
any
political
election
which
he
construes
as
any
election
--
i
--
i
don't
know
how
i
would
generalize
it
but
any
political
election
is
probably
as
good
a
word
as
any.
beer
and
wine
is
a
political
election
as
staged
by
the
state,
voting
for
a
school
board.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
but
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
whether
or
not
it
could
be
argued,
sir,
that
the
state
--
that
section
should
be
confined
to
elections
to
determine
sovereignty
over
territory,
i
don't
know
but
i
think
probably
not.
i
--
i
--
but
i
must
confess
i
did
not
look
at
it
with
that
in
mind.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
--
they
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
they
were.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
they
were.
they
didn't
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
i
can
think
of
a
lot
of
good
reasons
why
they
might
be
but
i
don't
know
what
the
reason
was.
i'm
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
right.
but
they
didn't
want
americans
to
go
over
there
and
vote.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
sure,
certainly.
i'm
--
i'm
not
prepared
to
say,
your
honor,
that
congress
couldn't
make
its
displeasure
effective.
i'm
not
so
sure
that
congress
couldn't
make
it
a
crime
for
an
american
to
vote
in
a
foreign
political
election
or
plebiscite.
but
if
it
were
to
do
so,
could
it
conceivably
be
said
that
it
would
be
appropriate
punishment
for
that
kind
of
an
act
to
deprive
a
man
of
his
citizenship
which
would
make
him
subject
to
banishment
from
his
country?
i
just
can't
believe
that
that
kind
of
punishment
is
appropriate
for
that
kind
of
an
act
even
if,
as
it's
not
the
case
now,
these
were
made
a
punishment
for
a
criminal
act
and
not
simply
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
an
administrative
forfeiture.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
yes,
sir.
that
may
be
correct,
although
it
depends
a
little
bit
on
how
you
look
at
it.
the
power
of
involuntary
expatriation
is
the
power
which
i
would
challenge.
the
power
to
be
concerned
about
americans
doing
something
outside
of
this
country,
i
certainly
don't
challenge
and
couldn't.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
you're
--
you're
assuming
one
fact
which
isn't
in
our
case
although
i
will
pass
that.
this
man
--
there
is
no
finding
that
this
man
understood.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
but
there
is
a,
it
seems
to
me,
a
great
deal
of
difference.
if
a
person
--
if
the
lady
marries
her
husband
in
1907,
we
must
put
ourselves
in
that
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
year,
and
becomes
automatically
thereby
as
she
would
anywhere
in
the
world,
a
subject
and
citizen
and
national
of
her
husband's
country,
it
seems
to
me
a
wholly
different
matter
than
to
say
“i
go
over
to
the
(inaudible)
and
vote
knowing
that
the
congress
has
said,
"if
you
do,
you're
going
to
forfeit
your
citizenship.”
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
she
--
she
knew
that
she
took
an
oath
of
allegiance
and
she
knew
that
she
became
a
national.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
no.
the
finding
was
not
--
well,
this
court,
at
least,
refused
to
accept
that
much
of
a
finding.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
it's
impossible.
[laughs]
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
i'm
not
saying
that
but
i
think
that
she
knows
when
she
takes
an
oath
of
allegiance
that
she
is
diluting
her
american
allegiance.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i'd
say
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
right.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
right.
well,
let
me
say,
your
honor.
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
i
would
--
i
am
not
urging
and
--
and
one
of
the
points
in
the
brief
which
i
have
filed
does
urge
that
the
due
process
clause
is
also
a
barrier
in
this
case.
i
cannot
conceive
as
i
have
just
said
of
the
appropriateness
of
the
punishment
of
forfeiture
of
citizenship
for
this
act
of
voting
in
a
foreign
election
but
i
--
i
would
like
also
to
--
to
say
that
i
think
that
a
more
basic
objection
is
present
and
that
is
that
congress
here
is
assuming
to
say
we
can
take
it
away
if
we
want
to
when
it's
given
by
the
constitution.
now,
let
me
turn
to
subsection
(j)
which
may
illustrate
this
point
a
little
bit
better
because
subsection
(j)
is
clearly
a
matter
in
which
congress
has
already
legislated.
subsection
(j)
makes
it
an
expatriating
act
to
leave
the
country
or
to
remain
out
of
the
country
to
avoid
military
service
in
war
time.
this
is
already
a
matter
which
congress
has
punished
or
has
provided
for
in
the
criminal
statutes.
it
is
provided
rather
severe
penalties.
this
penalty
still
remains
but
if
the
particular
person
evades
military
service
in
a
particular
way
by
going
out
of
the
country,
he
encourages
this
additional
forfeiture
of
his
citizenship.
again,
he
doesn't
acquire,
as
you
understand,
any
new
nationality
or
any
new
allegiance.
he
simply
loses
his
american
citizenship.
now,
i
think
that
this
also
presumes
--
this
also
assumes
for
congress
a
power
of
involuntary
expatriation,
a
power
to
deal
as
it
wishes
with
american
citizenship.
this
one,
however,
i
think,
is
subject
to
an
additional
difficulty
and
that
is
that
it
purports
to
impose
a
criminal
penalty
without
any
of
the
protection
which
the
constitution
affords
in
criminal
cases.
on
the
face
of
it,
it
is
obviously
a
criminal
penalty
--
it
looks
like
a
criminal
penalty
or
obviously
illegal
acts.
when
you
look
into
its
history,
that
conclusion
becomes
irresistible.
it
happens
that
we,
in
the
government,
are
not
in
dispute
on
the
origins
of
subsection
(j).
both
of
us
find
it
in
a
law
which
was
enacted
in
1865,
which
punished
deserters
and
draft
dodgers
whether
or
not
they
left
united
states
by
loss
of
the
rights
of
citizenship.
the
willingness
of
the
government
to
conceive
this
paternity
to
the
1865
statute
apparently
stems
from
its
desire
to
be
able
to
say
that
it
has
a
hundred
years
of
history
behind
it.
what
the
government
is
unwilling
to
recognize,
however,
is
that
if
the
statute
is
going
to
have
--
to
be
the
parent
for
one
purpose,
it
must
be
the
parent
for
all
purpose.
and
it
must
recognize
that
the
1865
statute
was
construed
by
this
court
to
require
a
--
a
criminal
conviction
before
the
loss
of
the
rights
of
citizenship
could
ensue.
it
was
a
criminal
statute.
now,
there
isn't
any
doubt
about
that
fact
although
the
government
rather
studiously
avoids
mentioning
it.
the
case
--
the
first
case
came
up
under
it
in
1866,
the
year
after
it
was
enacted
when
a
man
wanted
to
vote
in
pennsylvania
although
he
had
violated
the
statute.
judge
strong
in
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania,
judge
strong,
who
was
later
to
become
a
justice
of
this
court
in
about
four
years,
held
that
the
statute
had
to
be
construed
in
order
to
save
it
under
the
constitution
as
requiring
a
criminal
conviction,
a
conviction
in
that
case
by
court-martial
before
the
penalties
can
attack.
then
some
years
later,
the
question
came
up
to
this
court
in
kurtz
against
moffitt
in
115
united
state.
and
this
court,
quoting
and
citing
judge
strong's
decision
said
of
the
1865
act,
which,
by
that
time,
had
gotten
into
the
revised
statutes,
that
it
"can
only
take
effect
upon
conviction
by
court-martial”
as
was
clearly
shown
by
mr.
justice
strong
in
huber
against
riley
and
has
been
uniformly
held
by
the
civil
courts
as
well
as
by
the
military
authorities.
now,
the
1865
act
clearly
was
absorbed
into
the
1940
act
but
in
two
bites.
the
first
part
which
related
to
desertion
in
time
of
war
became
subsection
(g),
and
subsection
(g),
as
you
will
note
from
looking
at
it,
makes
explicit
what
this
court
had
held
was
implicit
in
the
1865
statute.
that
criminal
conviction
must
precede
any
application
of
the
statute.
that
is
now
specifically
made
the
law
of
subsection
(g).
the
other
part
of
the
act,
which
related
not
to
desertion
but
to
draft
dodging,
avoiding
the
draft,
came
in
by
later
amendment
in
1944.
but
that
subsection,
for
reasons
which
are
not
clear,
omitted
the
requirement
of
a
prior
criminal
conviction
before
this
could
apply.
the
legislative
history
of
that
1944
amendment
makes
it
abundantly
clear
that
congress
thought
it
was
imposing
an
additional
penalty
on
draft
dodgers,
on
the
kind
of
a
draft
dodger
that
might
not
be
caught
by
the
law
and
put
in
prison
because
he
was
outside
the
country.
the
government
would
dispose
of
the
comments
in
the
legislative
debates
on
that
section
when
they
talk
about
penalties
and
punishments
as
--
i
think
the
word
they
use
is
occasional
lapses
into
--
into
less
accurate
language.
but
i
--
we
have
set
them
all
out
in
our
brief.
i
submit
they
show
quite
clearly
that
congress
thought
it
was
going
to
punish
these
people,
that
they
deserve
punishment,
they
ought
to
be
punished
and
that
this
was
the
way
to
get
at
them
when
they
were
outside
of
the
united
states.
this
is
punishment
imposed,
in
other
words,
without
the
protections
of
the
constitution.
and
i
think
it
should
be
stricken
down.
but
before
i
close,
let
me
try
and
put
the
case
in
perspective,
at
least
put
it
in
--
in
my
perspective.
to
me,
this
concept
of
forfeiture
of
citizenship
by
administrative
act,
by
an
administrative
official
saying
it's
gone,
is
a
very
frightening
business.
the
right
of
citizenship
which
you
acquire
by
birth
in
this
country
is
probably
the
most
important
constitutional
right
you
have.
once
that
is
taken
away,
you
are
here
then
in
this
country
by
sufferance
and
by
tolerance.
you
can
be
expelled,
banished,
and
once
you're
banished,
you
have
no
constitutional
rights
left
at
all.
so
the
right
we're
talking
about
is
not,
by
any
means,
a
minor
right,
it
is
the
major
right
of
americans.
now,
i
think
i
detect
in
the
brief
of
the
government
some
appreciation
of
the
dangers
or
of
the
fears
that
might
be
raised
by
the
application
of
this
newly
asserted
power.
the
government
concedes
or
perhaps,
more
accurate
i
should
say,
emphasizes
that
this
power
can
be
--
can
be
utilized
for
conduct
of
only
a
particular
kind
and
the
words
that
they
use
to
describe
this
limitation
are
conduct
closely
related
to
the
cardinal
elements
of
nationality
and
allegiance.
those
words
would
carry
a
good
deal
more
comfort
to
me
if
they
were
not
already
construed.
in
this
case
and
in
this
brief
to
apply
to
voting
for
beer
and
wine
in
liquor
stores
in
canada
which
to
me
is
anything
but
closely
related
to
the
cardinal
elements
of
nationality
and
allegiance.
but
even
if
you
are
to
take
them
at
face
value,
they
seem
to
me
to
offer
very
little
comfort.
they
assert
a
power
in
congress
to
define
the
cardinal
elements
of
nationality
and
allegiance
and
to
provide
that
unless
those
cardinal
elements
exist,
you
are
not
worthy
of
citizenship
and
it's
taken
away
from
you.
this
can
be
done
by
administrative
action
with
--
with
or
without
judicial
review.
it
may
be
possible,
it
may
not.
this
is
not
done
to
punish
anybody
for
a
crime.
this
is
simply
a
congressional
definition
of
100%
americanism
and
an
administrative
determination
as
to
who
is
100%
and
who
is
90%.
the
90%
aren't
worthy
of
citizenship
and
it's
taken
away
from
them,
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
that,
to
me,
is
a
terribly
frightening
prospect.
i
think
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
history
of
this
country
deny
that
any
such
powers
that
was
ever
contemplated
for
congress,
i
think
the
power
that
congress
is
now
trying
to
assert
finds
no
support
in
--
it
certainly
is
denied
by
the
wong
kim
ark
decision.
it
was
explicitly
denied
in
the
mackenzie
against
hare.
it
finds
no
support
in
savorgnan.
it
seems
to
me
to
be
inconsistent
with
the
statement
made
in
rabang
against
boyd.
and
it
seems
to
me
utterly
inconsistent
with
the
nature
of
american
constitutional
government
that
a
constitutional
right,
a
right
derived
without
the
necessity
for
legislation
or
judicial
action,
derived
from
the
constitution
can
be
taken
away
by
a
congressional
definition
of
citizenship
for
who
is
or
who
is
not
worthy
of
citizenship.
i
submit
that
such
a
power
is
that
should
be
finally
and
firmly
forbidden.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
the
attorney
general's
opinion?
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
yes.
it's
in
the
reports
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
decision.
it's
on
page
21
of
my
brief
but
it's
the
--
it's
the
matter
of
f,
2
i.
&
n.
dec.
427.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
this
is
the
white
brief.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
21.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
yes,
about
10
lines
down.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
the
matter
of
f.
f
blank.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
no.
the
attorney
general
simply
stated
that
he
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
it's
not
even
a
letter.
he
just
overruled
and
refused
to
accept
the
decision
of
the
board.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
the
only
place
that
i
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
(voice
overlap)
report.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
just
a
--
pure
words,
your
honor.
first,
let
me
speak
to
this
question
that
you
were
just
discussing
as
to
the
facts.
i
think
the
court
below
operated
on
the
assumption
which
i
am
sure
is
the
correct
assumption
under
the
statute
that
it's
only
--
the
only
findings
it
had
to
make
were
the
findings,
did
this
man
vote
in
a
political
election,
did
he
stay
out
of
the
country
to
avoid
the
draft?
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
and
there
is
nothing
that
you
could
find
out
from
even
the
hearings
before
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
into
which
i
looked
which
would
tell
you
why
he
did
these
things.
the
solicitor
general
would
have
you
approach
this
case
as
if
these
two
sections
were
to
be
treated
as
evidentiary
in
terms
of
his
intention
that
you
take
these
into
account
in
determining
whether
this
man
ought
to
be
held
to
have
abandoned
his
citizenship.
they
do
not
operate
in
that
fashion.
they
operate
automatically.
the
vote
is
the
fact
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
i
don't
know
why
he
voted
in
the
election.
i
could
think
of
a
lot
of
reasons
why
he
might
have
voted,
which
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
dividing
his
allegiance
or
showing
any
lack
of
allegiance
for
united
states.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i
think
he
voted
for
president
aleman
in
the
elections
of
1946.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
it
wasn't
here.
now,
let
me
come
to
beer,
your
honor.
[laughs]
i
hope
i
didn't
mislead
you
but
i
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that
attorney
general
did
rule
that
voting
on
that
issue
in
that
election
lost
--
caused
ms.
(inaudible)
her
citizenship.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
[laughs]
well,
i
thought
you
had
the
impression
that
i
have
misstated
the
case
in
some
fashion.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i
didn't
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i
hoped
to
shock
you.
i
didn't
want
to
shock
you.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
it
shock
me
but
i
didn't
want
to
shock
you
improperly
[laughs].
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
now,
let
me
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
i
perhaps
didn't
distinguish
between
opinions
of
the
attorney
general
and
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
the
ruling
of
the
attorney
general.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
he
said,
if
she
wants
to
go
to
court,
she
can.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
but
i'm
going
to
say
that
she
loses
her
citizenship.
if
she
wants
to
go
to
court,
she
can.
if
she
wants
to
come
and
be
renatularized,
she
can.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
but
she's
out
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i
should
think
he
should
not
be
allowed
to,
either.
i've
heard
the
court
of
that.
one
other
item
which
is
related
to
the
matter
which
we
were
discussing
as
to
this
man's
dual
citizenship,
there
is
no
finding
by
the
court
that
he
was
a
dual
national,
either
by
the
court
or
by
the
bureau
--
or
by
immigration
and
naturalization
service.
one
could
construct
a
theory
upon
which
he
would
be,
i
concede
that.
i
could
construct
the
theory
upon
which
he
would
not.
it,
however,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
must
be
irrelevant
as
your
honor
pointed
out
in
the
questions.
whether
a
man's
parents
were
american-born
or
foreign-born
as
to
what
his
rights
are
under
the
constitution,
i
think
that
issue
must
be
an
irrelevant
issue.
i
would
concede
that
the
proposition
which
i
state
in
terms
of
what
a
man
may
do
or
may
not
do
in
order
to
abandon
citizenship
might
have
to
be
phrased
somewhat
differently
in
the
case
of
a
man
who
involuntarily
was
a
dual
national,
who,
because
of
the
nature
of
his
parents'
birth
was
claimed
by
italy
or
france
or
japan
or
what
have
you,
it
might
make
a
difference.
but
it
would
only
be
a
matter
of
phraseology.
his
substantive
rights
under
the
constitution
must
be
the
same.
now,
one
more
word
and
i'll
be
done.
the
solicitor
general
has
referred
to
the
necessity
for
the
united
states
to
have
the
attributes
of
sovereignty.
of
course,
it
must
have
the
attributes
of
sovereignty
and
it
does.
but
certainly,
it
is
not
and
has
never
been
the
law
that
in
exercising
those
attributes
of
sovereignty,
the
united
states
may
act
in
derogation
of
constitutional
rights.
i
suppose
it
is
true
almost
everywhere
in
the
world
that
a
nation
can
legislate
about
church
matters.
most
nations
do
not
separate
church
and
state.
that
that
certainly
does
not
mean
that
in
the
united
states,
because
you
can
point
to
all
the
other
places
where
the
congress
or
the
legislature
or
the
executive
can
deal
with
the
church,
that
congress
here
can
avoid
the
first
amendment.
we
have
here
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
we
do.
but
we
certainly
admit
that
it
is
still
effective,
notwithstanding,
the
nature
of
sovereignty
and
the
existence
of
the
similar
power
in
other
countries.
what
we
have
here
but
i
cannot
say
it
too
much
and
too
sincerely,
is
a
constitutionally
protected
right.
a
very
important
constitutionally
protected
right,
native-born
citizenship.
it
seems
to
me
impossible
to
believe
that
that
right
can
be
at
the
discretion
of
congress
to
take
away
for
as
light
or
as
grave
a
reason
as
it
sees
fit.
i
submit
that
the
decision
below
should
be
reversed.
