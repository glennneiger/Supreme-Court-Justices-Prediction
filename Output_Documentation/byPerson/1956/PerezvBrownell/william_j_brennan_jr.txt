is
that
found
in
your
brief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
now
regard,
mr.
horsky,
of
whether
it
happened
to
be
an
election
that
determines
sovereignty
over
foreign
territory.
in
other
words,
was
plebiscite
modified
only
by
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
determine
the
sovereignty,
etcetera
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
modified
only
plebiscite?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
clear
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
i
understand
that
the
congressional
history
supports
no
interpretation
of
(e)
that
the
words
“to
determine
the
sovereignty
over
foreign
territory”
modify
election
as
well
as
plebiscite?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you've
been
suggesting
that
this
is
aimed
at
voting
in
any
foreign
election,
whatever
and
you
gave
us
an
illustration
that
currently
the
attorney
general
considers
the
same
as
any
foreign
election.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
any
event,
beer
and
wine
is
certainly
not
to
determine
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
sovereignty
of
a
foreign
territory.
