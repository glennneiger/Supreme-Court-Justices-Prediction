m.
harlan
just
when
did
that
issue
get
submitted?
do
you
contend
that
assuming
the
falsity
of
the
affidavit
that
it's
also
a
necessary
element
for
a
decompliance
however
that
maybe
accomplished,
that
the
knowledge
of
the
falsity
would
be
brought
home
to
the
union?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
do.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
is
true.
that
--
i
understand
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
important
thing
now
that
you
say
that
there
can't
be
any
decompliance
under
any
sort
of
circumstances
short
of
knowledge
to
every
union
member.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
should
think
not.
justice
john
m.
harlan

might
cut
the
other
way
too,
that
isn't
a
very
sensible
construction
to
set
out.
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
did
they
submit
that
issue
to
the
examiner?
justice
john
m.
harlan
shall
be
--
you're
self
constricted
by
that.
