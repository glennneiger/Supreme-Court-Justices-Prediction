justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
kammholz,
would
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
kammholz,
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
kind,
even
slight
evidence
to
indicate
that
the
board
stated
(inaudible)
originally
either
because
it
felt
it
had
no
power
or
as
a
matter
of
what
seemed
then
to
be
administratively
desirable.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
fact
is
that
the
board
that
didn't
move
in
on
this
field
at
all
would
said
justice
ought
to
do.
that's
actually
what
was
done?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
--
but
there
is
no
evidence
that
that
was
done
either
because
they
thought
they
had
no
power
or
administered
a
way
even
if
they
had
the
power
or
not,
a
desirable
thing
to
do?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
kammholz,
may
i
ask
just
this
one
question?
on
the
premise
that
the
board
does
have
the
power
to
decomply,
do
i
understand
that
it's
the
board's
view
that
the
board
must
be
satisfied
not
only
that
the
affidavit
is
false
but
also
that
the
union
membership
had
knowledge
of
the
falsity?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
that
if
you
have
the
power,
you
may
decomply
merely
upon
being
satisfied
that
the
affidavit
was
in
fact
false?
