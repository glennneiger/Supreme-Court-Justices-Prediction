mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
the
question
presented
in
this
case,
if
the
court
please,
is
whether
the
board
has
power
to
declare
a
union
out
of
compliance
upon
a
finding
in
a
separate
administrative
proceeding
that
an
officer
of
the
union
has
filed
false
non-communist
affidavits
and
that
the
union
membership
was
aware
of
their
falsity.
this
case
arose
out
of
proceedings
before
the
board
in
which
it
issued
its
determination
and
order
in
early
1955
to
the
effect
that
the
international
union
of
mine,
mill
and
smelter
workers
was
out
of
compliance
with
the
9
(h)
because
one
maurice
travis,
secretary-treasurer
of
the
organization,
had
filed
--
excuse
me
--
affidavits
which
were
false
and
that
the
membership
was
aware
of
such
falsity.
by
way
of
background,
the
record
shows
that
commencing
in
1949,
travis
and
other
officers
of
the
union
had
filed
affidavits.
the
board
had
presumed
them
to
be
true
and
had
held
the
union
in
compliance.
in
1953,
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
in
chicago
involving
prior
to
scientific
precision
--
involving
precision
scientific
and
the
refusal
to
bargain
charge
against
that
company,
the
respondent
company
asserted
among
other
things
that
at
the
time
travis
filed
his
initial
1949
affidavit,
he
had
stated
publicly
and
there
had
been
released
in
the
union
publication
at
that
time
a
statement
to
the
effect
that
he
had
resigned
from
the
communist
party
solely
in
order
that
he
might
be
able
to
execute
the
affidavits
required
under
the
taft-hartley
law
but
that
he
nevertheless
continued
to
adhere
to
the
principles
of
communism
and
the
communist
party.
the
board
then
is
now
treating
questions
of
compliance
for
its
administrative
determination
and
not
for
litigation
in
a
representation
or
an
unfair
labor
practice
case,
thereupon
issued
an
order
directing
an
administrative
hearing
on
this
question.
specifically,
it
directed
that
the
hearing
be
held
before
a
board
hearing
officer
for
the
purpose
of
receiving
evidence
on
two
issues.
first,
whether
travis
in
fact
had
admitted
that
the
affidavits
which
he
had
filed
with
the
board
pursuant
to
9
(h)
were
false,
and
secondly,
whether
the
membership
of
the
union
was
aware
of
such
falsity.
the
--
the
order
also
provided
for
opportunity
for
oral
argument
in
filing
the
briefs
with
the
board.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
the
record
indicates
about
100,000.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
yes,
your
honor.
whether
the
membership
of
the
union
was
aware
that
the
travis
affidavit
--
affidavits
were
false.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
general
knowledge
is
what
the
record
in
this
case
would
suggest,
your
honor.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
that
was
one
of
the
issues,
whether
there
was
general
knowledge
by
the
membership.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
by
the
membership,
precisely.
the
hearings
were
held
before
a
hearing
officer
over
a
period
of
four
months
in
1954.
there
was
a
full
opportunity
for
examination,
cross-examination
of
witnesses.
travis
did
not
appear.
he
did
not
appear
even
in
response
to
a
subpoena
ad
testificandum.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
he
was.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
the
hearing
officer
issued
--
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
yes,
at
that
time.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
yes.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
the
hearing
officer
found
that
among
other
things,
the
august
1949,
travis'
statement
is
closed
on
its
face
that
is
contemporaneous
non-communist
affidavit
filed
with
the
board
was
false
and
found
further
that
the
membership
of
the
union
was
aware
of
the
falsity
of
travis'
1949
affidavit
and
of
subsequent
affidavits,
but
nonetheless,
continued
to
reelect
him
to
office
as
secretary-treasurer
of
the
union.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
think
the
sole
issue
here
is
power.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
it
was
not
reached
by
the
court
below.
that
is
why
i
make
the
rather
categorical
statement
that
i
make
here.
if
--
if
your
honors
come
to
it,
it
seems
to
us
that
they
remand
questions
involved.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
because
the
court
--
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
our
view
is,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
it's
not
here
because
the
court
below
did
not
reach
it.
the
court
below
found
simply
that
the
board
had
no
power
to
engage
--
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
yes.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
yes,
sir.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
that
is
--
that
is
our
view,
your
honor.
yes,
sir.
now,
the
--
the
1949
travis
statement
is
documented
in
detail
in
our
brief
in
view
of
this
colloquy
with
your
honor.
i
--
i
wonder
whether
i
want
to
devote
too
much
time
to
it.
perhaps
it's
sufficient
to
say
here
that
the
board
findings
of
falsity
and
union
awareness
were
based
on
this
general
proposition
as
outlined
--
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
precisely.
on
this
general
proposition
that
travis,
in
the
document
that
was
released
to
his
membership
said
this,
“he
was
resigning
because
he
has
been
confronted
with
--
because
he
had
been
confronted
with
the
problem,
resigning
from
the
communist
party
in
order
to
make
it
possible
for
me
to
sign
the
taft-hartley
affidavit.
this
has
not
been
an
easy
step
for
me
to
make.
membership
in
the
communist
party
has
always
meant
to
me
as
a
member
and
officer
of
the
international
union
that
i
could
be
a
better
trade
unionist.
i
have
been
a
communist
because
i
want
what
all
decent
americans
want,
a
higher
standard
of
living
and
et
cetera.
despite
my
resignation
from
the
communist
party,
i
will
continue
to
fight
for
these
goals
with
all
the
energy
and
sincerity
at
my
command.
at
the
same
time,
i
want
to
make
it
absolutely
clear
that
my
opinion
continues
to
be,
that
only
a
fundamental
change
in
the
structure
of
our
society
along
the
lines
implied
in
the
very
words
of
the
charter
of
our
international
labor
produces
all
wealth.
wealth
belongs
to
the
producer
thereof
and
lead
to
the
end
of
insecurity,
discrimination,
depressions
and
the
danger
of
war.
i
am
convinced
that
capitalistic
greed
is
responsible
for
war
and
its
intended
war.
therefore,
i
want
to
make
it
crystal
clear
that
my
belief
in
communism
is
consistent
with
what
i
believe
to
be
the
best
interest
of
the
members
of
this
union
and
the
american
people
generally,
and
that
i
am
especially
happy
to
be
able
constantly
to
remember
that
it
is
consistent
with
the
finest
traditions
of
the
international
union.”
on
these
findings,
the
board
on
the
basis
of
the
finding
of
this
--
of
the
publication
of
this
statement
and
the
affidavit
as
filed
by
travis,
the
board
concluded
that
the
union
was
not
and
had
not
been
in
compliance
with
9
(h)
in
order
that
the
union
be
accorded
no
further
benefits
under
the
act
until
it
had
complied.
thereupon,
a
suit
was
commenced
by
the
union
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
contending
inter
alia
that
the
board's
determination
was
beyond
its
powers
under
the
act.
in
that
proceeding,
precision
scientific
intervened
and
alleged
among
other
things
that
the
union
in
fact
was
not
a
labor
organization
and
that
it
was
in
court
with
unclean
hands,
and
therefore,
ought
to
be
denied
injunctive
relief
for
which
it
craved.
the
district
court
denied
the
preliminary
injunction.
a
prompt
appeal
was
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals.
it
remanded,
and
after
some
clarification
of
what
remand
meant,
a
--
an
injunction
was
issued
against
the
board.
the
court
of
appeals
took
the
position
as
suggested
in
the
proceeding
argument
that
the
sole
sanction
was
the
criminal
penalty
and
that
the
board
had
no
power
to
engage
in
a
separate
administrative
proceeding
relating
to
decompliance
status
of
the
union.
this
implies
of
course
--
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
that
is
right,
your
honor.
not
so,
however,
in
the
sixth
circuit
where
the
contrary
view
has
been
taken
and
that
--
that's
why
we're
here.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
the
court's
position
of
course
implies
that
the
board
function
with
reference
to
non-communist
affidavits
is
purely
a
ministerial
one,
that
it
has
no
right
or
authority
to
look
behind
the
paper
to
inquire
into
truth
or
falsity,
that
it
must
accept
affidavits
even
though
they
concededly
be
false
as
counsel
harwood
suggested
in
the
prior
argument.
it
is
the
board
position
that
both
apart
from
and
under
the
language
of
9
(h),
the
board
possesses
implied
power
to
protect
its
processes
from
abuse
and
this
is
confirmed
by
the
legislative
history
and
the
scheme
of
the
statute
with
particular
reference
to
these
filing
requirements
in
the
purpose
of
the
congress
in
providing
for
non-communist
affidavits
under
the
act,
witness
the
highland
park
language.
i
should
like
at
this
point
to
document
briefly
the
history
of
what
the
board
has
done
on
this
subject
in
response
to
your
previous
inquiry,
mr.
chief
justice
warren.
at
the
outset,
the
board
established
an
affidavit
compliance
section.
it
took
the
position
that
the
question
of
truth
or
falsity
was
for
the
department
of
justice
and
that
if
evidence
came
to
it
of
false
swearing,
those
matters
should
be
referred
to
the
department
of
justice
for
such
action
as
it
might
deem
appropriate.
shortly
afterwards,
however,
in
connection
with
its
administration
of
the
act,
it
became
apparent
that
certain
other
rules
of
the
game
would
need
to
be
established.
the
problem
arose
first
in
connection
with
the
so-called
fronting
by
another
labor
organization
or
by
an
individual
on
behalf
of
a
labor
organization
not
in
compliance.
and
the
board
early
held
that
where
a
fronting
situation
existed,
it
was
entitled
to
look
into
the
true
facts
of
the
situation
and
was
empowered
to
dismiss
a
charge
and
refuse
to
proceed
on
a
complaint
if
a
front
was
presented.
subsequently,
and
i
--
this
occurred
in
early
19
--
in
late
1952,
the
first
conviction
under
a
false
9
(h)
affidavit
occurred
in
new
york.
the
union
officer
was
valenti,
an
official
of
the
united
packinghouse
workers.
about
that
same
time,
a
grand
jury
had
been
convened
in
new
york
and
it
inquired
specifically
into
the
veracity
of
a
number
of
9
(h)
affidavits
filed
by
officers
of
other
unions.
the
grand
jury
issued
a
presentment,
which
was
transmitted
to
the
board
by
judge
weinfeld
asserting
that
these
officers,
including
gold,
had
declined
before
the
grand
jury
to
acknowledge
that
the
affidavits
they
have
previously
filed
were
truthful,
that
this
was
a
proper
matter
for
board
inquiry.
not
long
--
long
afterwards
in
1953,
the
senate
subcommittee,
to
which
i
made
previous
reference,
rendered
its
report
in
which
it
asserted
that
in
questions
involving
falsity,
the
board
did
have
the
right
to
look
behind
and
was
not
obligated
to
rely
on
a
precarious
affidavit.
thereupon,
the
board
first
issued
an
administrative
order
reciting
the
facts
set
forth
in
this
presentment
and
requiring
that
a
hearing
be
had
to
determine
the
facts.
this
--
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
both,
i
would
say,
your
honor.
i
would
say
both.
this
inquiry
was
blocked
in
early
1953
by
the
first
injunction
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
that
is
the
united
electrical
workers
case,
then
came
subsequent
injunctions
blocking
further
action
and
other
inquiry
by
the
board
on
this
same
question.
the
scheme
of
9
(h)
contemplates
a
continuing
scrutiny
by
the
board.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
yes.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
no,
your
honor.
my
--
there
was
nothing
formal.
that
was
an
intramural
operation.
they
were
simply
transmitted
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
to
the
department
of
justice.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
that's
--
that's
an
intriguing
inquiry,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
wouldn't
undertake
to
answer
offhand
for
a
variety
of
reasons.[laughs]
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
the
early
--
the
early
interpretation
of
the
chairman
of
the
board
and
--
of
the
chairman
of
the
board
was
as
contended
--
as
is
contended
by
the
respondent
here,
that
the
board
was
not
obligated
or
empowered
to
engage
in
administrative,
the
determination
of
truth
or
falsity.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
they
did
in
part,
they
did
in
part.
but
curiously
enough
on
the
question
of
perjurious
affidavit
presented
in
lannom,
the
view
was
contra
there,
chairman
herzog
in
1952
i
believe,
asserted
that
of
course
if
a
false
affidavit
were
filed
and
was
in
conviction
the
board
was
not
obligated
to
--
to
--
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
--
rely
upon
it.
this
was
testimony
before
the
same
subcommittee.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
that
is
referred
to,
your
honor,
in
the
lannom
brief,
the
footnote
at
page
13.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
in
the
other
brief,
in
number
40,
yes,
lannom.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
page
13.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
our
brief,
yes.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
i
suppose
there
are
two
factors
that
were
significant
in
that
regard,
mr.
justice
warren.
one,
the
experience
over
the
ensuing
years
and
two,
in
the
light
of
that
experience,
a
different
look
at
it
by
different
personnel
of
the
agency.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
it
might
well
have
a
marked
impact
on
what
the
people
on
the
board
thought
that
history
had
intended
--
was
intended
to
be.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
no,
not
all.
i'm
--
i'm
just
trying
to
say
simply
and
i'm
not
doing
it
very
articulately
that
whereas
here,
i
think
it
must
be
conceded
the
legislative
history
is
somewhat
fuzzy.
experience
may
be
an
excellent
teacher
on
what
was
initially
intended
by
the
congress.
in
that
same
connection,
it
should
be
noted
that
this
senate
subcommittee
in
1953
came
to
the
same
conclusion
that
we're
contending
for
here
and
i
would
assume
that
the
board
gave
some
attention
to
that
authoritative
statement
by
the
committee,
the
subcommittee
as
this
court
has
pointed
out,
statements
of
that
character
do
land
on
authoritative
clause
to
legislative
intent.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
i
think
the
cumulative
experience
with
this
--
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
i
--
i
wouldn't
undertake
to
answer
that.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
it's
been
a
continuing
change
and
i
--
i
can't
delineate
it
for
you
precisely
at
this
time.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
and
then
testified
the
other
way,
yes.
basically
--
basically,
the
personnel
in
1952
and
1953
was
--
if
i
may
use
the
term
"still
old
board”
pretty
much
whether
it
had
been
the
membership
in
the
preceding
few
years.
there
had
been
no
marked
change
in
that
period.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
yes,
your
honor.
may
i
check
that
with
a
colleague?
my
impression
is
that
it
was.
was
it
not
unanimous?
the
change
of
the
board's
attitude
on
the
question
of
its
authority
to
act
administratively,
it
was
then
and
it
has
been
since
unanimous.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
well,
your
honor,
he
was
there
long
before
i.
he
got
on
in
[laughs]
1940.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
he's
been
there
a
long
time.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
yes,
yes.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
well,
he
was
in
the
senate
until
three.
i
think
he
got
it
in
1947.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
the
problem
was
not
posed
in
the
early
days,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
that's
precisely
what
happened.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
there
were
suggestions
as
i
recall
it,
they
thought
they
didn't
have
the
power.
certainly,
the
--
it
was
--
it
was
a
fairly
firm
statement
by
chairman
herzog
with
reference
to
the
separate
administrative
proceeding.
he
--
he
took
a
pretty
categorical
position.
they
didn't
have
the
power
that
was
for
justice.
on
the
question
of
conviction,
his
view
was
contra
that
if
there
had
been
a
conviction
of
false
affidavit,
of
course,
the
board
should
not
be
bound
by
it.
these
further
brief
observations
i
think
are
appropriate
that
quite
apart
from
the
9
(h)
provisions,
the
board
over
the
years
has
exercised
its
implied
power
to
protect
its
processes
from
abuse.
as
suggested
earlier,
it
has
refused
to
proceed
on
a
charge
where
it
appeared
later
that
the
charging
party
had
been
guilty
of
violence
and
duress
against
respondent.
it
--
it
refused
to
proceed
where
it
appeared
that
the
purpose
of
a
charge
was
to
further
this
--
the
designs
of
the
communist
party
rather
than
protect
the
rights
of
individual
employees.
it
refused
to
proceed
where
a
fictitious
representation
claim
was
made
and
it
refused
to
proceed
where
a
board
certification
was
utilized
to
further
racial
discrimination.
this,
we
assert,
is
analogous
here
as
a
situation
where
we
suggest
that
it's
appropriate
for
the
agency
to
exercise
its
administrative
discretion
in
protecting
its
--
its
status,
its
authority
from
abuse.
thank
you.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
very
briefly,
i
should
like
to
make
two
observations.
first,
it
is
our
view
that
the
administrative
procedures
act
has
no
bearing
here.
this
is
not
a
question
of
rule
making,
it's
an
adjudicatory
question.
secondly,
on
the
subject
of
the
communist
control
act
of
1954,
we
deal
with
it
in
a
footnote
at
page
39
of
our
brief.
suffice
it
to
say
here,
i
think
that
act
did
not
purport
to
repeal
the
provisions
of
9
(h).
it
deals
with
a
broader
subject
and
consequently,
we
submit
has
no
application
to
the
question
before
the
court.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
we
shall
be
delighted
to
do
that,
your
honor.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
there
is
this
other
consideration.
the
board
in
a
number
of
earlier
cases
treated
of
the
problem
specifically
in
unfair
labor
practice
proceedings
and
of
course
consistently
took
the
--
the
position
that
this
question
was
not
litigable
in
--
in
our
(inaudible)
case
but
only
in
a
separate
proceeding.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
that
is
not
our
position.
we
think
the
--
the
basic
question
is
one
of
power
and
that
a
showing
of
awareness
is
not
essential.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
that
is
our
position.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
your
honor,
it
grew
out
of
language
in
the
huey
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
of
columbia
in
1954,
i
believe.
the
board
read
dictum
in
that
decision
as
suggesting
that
this
was
an
appropriate
subject
for
its
consideration.
mr.
theophil
c.kammholz
we
do
not.
