what
was
the
--
what
was
decided
not
to
be
--
be
about
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
100,000.
and
what
was
specifically
the
issue
bringing
the
whole
knowledge
falsity
(inaudible)
did
the
membership
of
the
union
do
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
meant
a
100,000
or
does
it
mean
something
else?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i'm
not
questioning
how
the
knowledge
was
brought
forth,
whether
it's
the
objective
to
the
--
the
issue
to
be
ascertained
whether
the
100,000,
whatever
the
--
whatever
the
basis,
whatever
the
evidence
has
included.
100
--
it
was
brought
over
the
knowledge
at
least
undersized,
this
--
this
issue
before
it
happens.
and
was
that
the
issue
that
they
put
to
the
hearing
officer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
the
--
by
the
whole
membership?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
he
an
officer
at
that
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
the
time
of
the
hearing
on
the
falsity?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
validity
--
is
the
correctness
of
that
finding
on
either
showing
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
conceded,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
stating
a
word
by
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
provided
to
be
otherwise
if
you
cut
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wouldn't
come
to
that
issue.
but
suppose
--
suppose
you're
--
on
the
reason
here
on
the
power
that
the
court
--
would
the
court
below
properly
accept
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
remanded
question
doesn't
have
to
be
trespassed
if
you
don't
believe
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
to
affect
the
course
of
your
argument,
i
just
want
to
know
what
it
is
i
have
to
listen
in
my
mind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
simply,
six
of
the
circuit
judges
charged
him
in
its
view
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
had.
i
know
that
this
case
was
before
judges
anderson
and
washington
last
year
in
the
trials.
the
third
case
was
before
three
other
judges.
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
as
a
(voice
overlap)
in
the
head
of
the
judges.
justice
felix
frankfurter
thereupon,
is
(inaudible)
connection
to
this
or
both?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
other
way
around,
is
there
any
manifestation
of
the
--
the
call
for
insanity
for
that
question?
i
--
i
don't
suppose
the
board
--
can
the
board
get
an
opinion
from
the
attorney
general.suppose
that's
--
we
actually
have
general
counsel
for.
justice
felix
frankfurter
relied
on
the
opinion
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
give
me
reference
to
that?
(inaudible)
for
chairman
herzog's
testimony
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
other
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
get
the
impression
that
--
that
an
overlapping
member
said
he
was
chairman
herzog.
he
evidently
--
was
change
--
he
evidently
was
a
part
of
the
board
or
the
department
of
justice
was
the
agency
to
enforce
perjury
provision
and
then
testified
against
him
the
other
way?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
help
me
out?
when
did
mr.
murdock
get
on
the
board?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he's
been
there
a
long
time.
i
can
see
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
he
was
--
was
he
one
of
these
people
who
changed
position,
senator
murdock?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
was
almost
--
i
didn't
know
he
was
quite
to
the
senate.
was
he
in
the
--
when
did
he
get
on
it,
1947?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
senate
was
--
he
may
have
been
in
the
senate
when
the
statute
was
passed
and
that
changed
--
then
read
his
own
history
back
and
then
forwards.

power
to
that,
we
do
it
all
the
time.[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
kammholz,
mr.
herzog
as
such
(inaudible)
in
this
field
has
--
i
looked
at
his
testimony.
i've
read
it
all
but
i'd
rather
not
to
see
that
the
testimony
he
gives
--
he
gave
had
assumed
--
i
know
he
ought
to
--
they
have
to
--
concerning
the
statute
means
--
i'm
reading
it.
but
i
can't
read
the
light
--
i
noticed
his
testimony
leaves
(inaudible)
on
--
developed
the
light
in
(inaudible)
because
on
page
53
of
the
testimony
he
says,
“it
is
my
recollection
of
what
happened
was
--
he
means
a
procedure.
it's
my
recollection
of
what
happened
was
that
if
a
party
raise
such
a
question
in
a
case,
we
said
it
was
not
litigable
before
the
court.
it's
because
(inaudible)
substantial
charge,
and
does
for
the
purpose
of
delay
for
having
a
particular
substantially
the
same
as
the
general
counsel.
it
may
refer
to
(inaudible)
general
counsel.”
but
later
on,
he
says
on
the
next
page,
“if
there
was
a
conviction
of
perjury."
"yes,
i
would."
mr.
herzog,
"an
affidavit,
if
it
is
perjurious,
certainly
should
not
be
regarded
as
a
valid
affidavit
so
that
in
that
--
both
argument,
the
testimony
on
the
one
hand
that
--
that
in
the
distribution
of
--
of
enforcement
function,
this
was
simply
to
state
it
in
the
department
of
justice,
on
the
other
hand,
the
perjurious
affidavit.
there's
no
affidavit
that
we
can
think
of
that
--
or
i
should
think
that
disqualified
that
effect
from
the
real
problem
in
this
case.
who
is
to
decide
or
what
is
the
procedure
for
determining
whether
the
--
the
jury
says
a
question.
if
you
--
if
you
by
any
chance
(inaudible)
there's
no
testimony,
it
couldn't
do
it.
it
files
on
those
pages
and
can
you
shed
some
other
light
(inaudible)
if
--
if
they
qualified.
it's
apparent
contradiction
to
the
disqualification
of
his
right
to
a
confession
alleged
in
the
memorandum.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
looks

i
don't
quite
