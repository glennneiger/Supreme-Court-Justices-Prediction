mr.
kammholz,
before
you
get
to
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
on
--
on
that
first
position
that
the
board
took
that
determined
that
the
question
of
a
falsity
of
the
host
was
a
matter
for
the
department
of
justice.
did

found
opinion

--
chief

warren
well,
mr.
kammholz,
the
reason
i
ask
is
because
at
that
particular
time
about
all
the
board
would
have
to
go
on
would
be
the
legislative
history
and
i
wondered
what
interpretation
it
put
upon
the
statements
of
senator
taft
at
the
time
the
conference
report
was
filed,
these
that
we've
been
--
that
we've
been
talking
about.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
base
that
upon
the
legislative
history,
particularly
the
attitude
of
senator
taft?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
can
see
mr.
kammholz,
how
the
board
would
learn
from
experience
as
to
what
its
function
probably
should
be
depending
upon
the
ramifications
of
--
of
such
situations.
but
i
--
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
why
they
would
interpret
the
legislative
history
in
particular,
senator
taft's
testimony
one
way
in
1947
and
then
come
out
exactly
the
other
way
in
1953.

experience
wouldn't
hardly
change
the
legislative
history,
would
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
the
legislative
history
would
change
from
time
to
time
to
fit
the
facts
that
they
saw.
