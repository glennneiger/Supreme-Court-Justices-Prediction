justice
hugo
l.
black
were
there
new
members
of
the
board
who
made
the
change?
do
they
have
more
experience
in
the
board
than
the
old
members
who
had
decided
the
other
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
--
i'm
talking
about
the
members
of
the
board
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
wasn't
change
in
the
first
bill?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
the
change
occurred,
was
it
unanimous?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
say
congress
did?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
else
do
you
say
congress
did?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
when
they
took
away
the
bill?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
you
said
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
consequence
with
congress
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
1954?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
don't
see
what
--
that
you
would
say
if
you
are
saying
that
the
passage
of
that
act
refutes
the
argument
he's
made
here
as
to
the
power
the
board
has.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
one
of
his
arguments
to
be
that
the
board
had
a
right
to
preserve
its
processes
from
perjurious
affidavits,
and
i
don't
see
why
the
passage
of
the
communist
control
act
answers
that
argument
in
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
say
about
chairman
herzog's
testimony
quoted
in
the
government's
brief,
on
page
13
of
his
brief
and
40,
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
