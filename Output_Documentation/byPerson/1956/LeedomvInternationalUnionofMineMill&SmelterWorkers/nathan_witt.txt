mr.
nathan
witt
may
it
please
the
court.
since
mr.
cammer
and
mr.
kammholz
have
discussed
the
legislative
history,
they
went
into
the
1947
statute,
and
also
in
light
of
the
questions
put
by
the
members
of
the
court
particularly
to
mr.
kammholz,
i'd
like
to
say
a
few
words
about
the
statute
which
was
passed
in
1954
subsequent
to
some
of
this
history
which
mr.
kammholz
was
just
telling
you
about.
in
august
1954,
the
communist
control
act
of
1954
was
enacted,
being
an
amendment
to
the
internal
security
act
of
1950.
in
the
communist
control
act
of
1954,
congress
defined
a
new
type
of
communist
organization
in
addition
to
those
which
had
been
defined
in
the
1950
act.
and
the
new
definition
pertained
to
"communist-infiltrated
organizations,"
being
an
additional
category
to
so-called
communist
action
and
communist-front
organizations
in
the
1950
act
with
which
your
honors
of
course
are
thoroughly
familiar
from
the
communist
party
case
involving
the
subversive
activities
control
board.
and
in
the
same
way
that
congress
entrusted
the
--
the
determination
of
the
type
of
organization
involved
in
the
1950
act
through
the
subversive
activities
control
board.
it
entrusted
the
determination
of
communist-infiltrated
organizations
to
the
subversive
activities
control
board
and
the
act
of
1954.
and
it
did
so
of
course
with
some
slight
variations
not
now
material,
certainly
not
material
to
this
case,
with
the
same
procedure
for
administrative
determination
and
judicial
review
as
had
been
made
in
the
1950
act.
so,
at
least
in
that
act,
whatever
else
we
might
say
about
it
in
an
appropriate
proceeding,
at
least
in
--
that
act
does
not
have
the
serious
defects,
constitutional
as
well
--
well
as
other
defects
which
we
complain
about
with
respect
to
what
the
nlrb
has
attempted
to
do
in
this
case.
but
aside
from
that
and
without
getting
into
--
into
the
details
about
the
1954
act,
there
are
two
points
that
will
be
--
that
ought
to
be
made
about
it
which
have
considerable
elements
to
the
issues
in
this
case.
the
first
is
actually
an
answer
to
the
argument
which
mr.
kammholz
makes
about
--
on
which
the
board
makes
in
its
brief
about
these
developments
which
began
with
the
conviction
of
valenti,
the
first
conviction
under
section
1001
for
having
filed
a
false
affidavit
pursuant
to
section
9
(h),
a
conviction
not
in
new
york
but
in
new
jersey.
late
in
1952,
a
few
months
after
chairman
herzog's
testimony
in
march
of
1952,
and
the
board
in
its
brief,
and
mr.
kammholz
touched
on
these
developments
in
his
argument,
relates
the
other
developments
from
19
--
the
end
of
1952,
the
one
--
valenti
conviction
into
the
time
in
1953
when
it
began
its
first
effort
to
assert
upon
what
should
--
therefore
said
and
said
over
and
over
again,
not
only
the
committees
of
congress
but
in
case
after
case
that
congress
had
not
entrusted
to
it
in
1947.
so
that,
just
about
the
same
time
when
mr.
kammholz
tells
us
that
these
developments
who
come
into
ahead
in
quoting
the
report
of
the
subcommittee
of
the
senate
labor
committee,
headed
by
senator
humphrey,
the
congress
took
steps
to
deal
with
the
problem
in
a
normal
way
by
passing
legislation
about
it.
the
second
point
to
be
made
about
the
communist
control
act
of
1954
is
that
unlike
the
consequences
which
fall
from
a
--
from
determinations
under
the
1950
act
legislation
enabling
all
the
rest
of
that.
as
far
as
the
1954
act
is
concerned,
be
waiting
for
communist-infiltrated
organizations
including
labor
organizations
and
there
is
no
question
that
the
--
that
the
1954
act
was
directed
principally
at
labor
organizations.
the
principal
sanction,
the
only
sanction
to
speak
off
in
the
1954
act
is
what
in
this
case
we
call
decompliance.
it's
not
called
that
in
the
1954
act,
but
the
1954
act
provides
that
once
an
order
becomes
final,
not
of
course
after
determination
by
the
sacb
but
after
judicial
review,
final
order
being
defined
in
the
same
way
as
it's
defined
in
1950
act.
the
1954
act
provides
that
a
union
loses,
the
union
found
to
be
communist
infiltrated,
loses
its
status
before
the
nlrb
and
in
fact
goes
further
and
loses
its
status
as
a
bargaining
representative
generally
and
that's
--
all
of
its
contracts
have
opened
to
petitions
filed
by
liable
unions
before
the
board,
etcetera,
etcetera.
so,
we
say
about
this
that
the
very
clear
history
which
we
derive
from
the
time
the
--
the
bill,
which
became
the
taft-hartley
act
in
1947
was
enacted.
we
say
the
very
clear
history
which
runs
in
our
direction
in
this
case
is
reinforced
by
congress,
was
reinforced
by
congress
in
1954.
and
if
mr.
kammholz
is
right
in
--
in
saying
that
these
developments
beginning
at
the
end
of
1952
were
pertinent,
then
the
conclusion
really
is
that
what
happened
was
that
congress
set
up
machinery
to
deal
with
the
problem.
therefore,
if
there
was
any
doubt
before
august
1954
about
this
power
which
the
board
to
say,
we
say
there
no
longer
is
any
doubt.
mr.
nathan
witt
in
--
mr.
nathan
witt
in
1954,
it
passed
that
--
mr.
nathan
witt
no,
sir.
mr.
nathan
witt
i'm
sorry
if
i
--
mr.
nathan
witt
--
perhaps,
i
mistook
--
misspoke
myself.
mr.
nathan
witt
the
pass
--
mr.
nathan
witt
well,
by
passing
the
communist
control
act
in
1954
if
there
was
any
slight
doubt
before
that,
mr.
justice
black,
whether
the
board
had
this
power.
then
by
passing
the
act
in
1954,
the
--
the
congress
foreclosed
any
doubt
and
made
it
very
clear
that
it's
this
single
method
provided
by
congress
in
1954
for
dealing
with
this
problem
of
communist-infiltrated
labor
organizations.
mr.
nathan
witt
well,
the
argument
that
the
board
makes
basically
here
and
it's
more
fully
developed
in
its
brief
is
taking
this
particular
case,
is
not
merely
that
travis
continued
to
be
a
communist
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
him
because
there's
an
ambiguity
about
that.
but
the
board
also
argues
that
congress
continue
to
be
concerned
with
communist
domination
or
communist
control
or
communist
infiltration
of
labor
organizations
despite
the
passage
of
section
9
(h)
and
that's
why
the
board
is
asserting
the
power
that's
asserted
in
this
case.
and
my
answer
--
mr.
nathan
witt
no,
it
doesn't
in
that
sense,
mr.
justice
black,
but
in
arguing
that
an
interpretation
should
be
put
on
the
legislative
history
of
the
1947
act,
the
board
argues
that
this
history
of
continued
communist
influence
or
control
or
domination,
supports
the
--
the
power
that
the
board
is
asserting
as
a
result
of
the
1947
act.
and
we
say
that
by
passing
the
1954
act,
the
congress
set
up
a
mechanism
for
dealing
with
it.
and
in
addition,
if
the
congress
had
wanted
to
give
this
board
the
power,
the
whole
problem
having
been
discussed
for
sometime
before
that
is
illustrated
by
chairman
herzog's
testimony
in
march
1952,
and
the
whole
problem
had
been
thoroughly
discussed
before
the
humphrey
subcommittee.
it
would
have
done
so
in
--
in
codifying
or
disposing
of
this
entire
problem
in
the
act,
which
it
passed
in
august
1954.
mr.
nathan
witt
well,
without
now
arguing
number
40,
your
honor,
that
quote
from
chairman
herzog
has
a
reference
to
a
conviction,
conviction
of
an
affiant,
the
way
union
officer
would
file
an
affidavit,
and
that's
not
our
case
at
all.
as
a
second
reason
why
the
board's
action
in
this
case
was
improper,
not
only
--
not
only
does
the
national
labor
relations
act
of
course
provide
that
the
board
may
enact
rules
and
regulations,
but
the
administrative
procedure
act
requires
that
it
sets
out
provisions
for
rule
making
by
administrative
agencies.
and
i
have
particular
reference
to
sections
2
(c)
and
4
of
the
apa,
section
2
(c)
providing
for
rule
making
and
section
4,
providing
for
giving
a
notice.
and
we
say
that
in
this
case,
the
power
which
the
board
asserts
to
decomply
unions
as
a
result
of
allegedly
false
affidavits
filed
by
their
officers
is
a
power
which
can
be
asserted
only
after
the
proposal
of
the
rules
as
pursuant
to
section
2
(c)
of
the
apa
and
notice
and
hearing
as
spelled
out
in
section
4
of
apa.
now,
this
case
illustrates,
it's
a
vivid
illustration
of
what
happens
when
those
provisions
not
complied
with
and
illustrates
at
least
one
of
the
good
reasons,
which
went
into
the
enactment
of
apa
particularly
in
light
of
the
fact
that
for
five
years
after
1947,
the
board
had
not
asserted
this
power
that
came
as
a
complete
suffice
when
it
asserted
it
for
the
first
time
in
1953.
and
the
history
of
the
lannom
case
and
the
history
of
this
case
demonstrates
that
there
is
no
way
of
knowing,
neither
officers
and
certainly
not
members
of
labor
unions,
have
any
ways
of
knowing
on
what
basis
the
board
will
act
in
its
efforts
to
decomply
unions.
but
in
any
event,
we
--
we
say
that
on
the
face
of
these
provisions
in
apa,
the
board's
action
in
this
case
was
improper.
now,
i'd
like
to
conclude
with
a
few
words
about
the
facts
in
this
case,
which
will
illustrate
--
which
will
illustrate
the
administrative
impossibility
or
rather
the
enormous
difficulties
and
confusions
which
are
created
or
which
would
be
created
if
the
board
were
given
this
power.
now,
mr.
kammholz
told
you
that
in
his
statement
in
1949,
mr.
travis
stated,
and
i'm
trying
to
quote
mr.
kammholz,
that
he
still
adhered
to
the
principles
of
communism
and
the
communist
party.
now,
nowhere
in
that
statement
will
you
find
any
remark
or
statement
by
mr.
travis
that
he
still
adheres
to
the
principles
of
the
communist
party
and
you
certainly
won't
find
it
in
the
extract
from
that
statement
that
mr.
kammholz
read
to
you.
now,
this
illustrates
what
happened
in
this
particular
case.
the
board
did
not
find
after
its
administrative
hearing
that
travis
had
admitted
that
at
the
time
he
signed
his
first
affidavit
in
august
1949,
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
or
affiliated
with
it.
what
the
board
found
in
rather
general
language
mostly
was
that
he
had
admitted
that
the
affidavit
was
false,
and
when
the
board
became
specific
about
it
in
its
decision
and
order
of
february
1st
1955
that
referred
to
his
continued
belief
in
communism.
now,
getting
back
to
a
question
that
you
asked,
mr.
chief
justice,
section
9
(h)
has
nothing
to
do
with
a
belief
in
communism
and
the
quotation
or
the
part
of
mr.
travis'
statement
that
mr.
kammholz
read
to
you
has
nothing
to
do
with
section
9
(h).
section
9
(h)
requires
the
affiant
to
swear
that
he's
not
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
not
affiliated
with
it,
nor
that
he
is
a
member
of
--
or
that
he
believes
in
or
supports
any
organization
which
believes
in
forcible
advocacy.
and
mr.
kammholz
in
his
argument
and
the
board
in
its
brief
is
very
careful
or
very
careful
to
stay
away
from
being
specific,
and
of
course
they
did
it
also
and
the
order
passed
--
the
decision
and
order
passed
in
february
1955,
being
specific
about
what
clause
of
that
provision
of
section
9
(h)
travis
falsified
and
what
clause
he
had
--
he
was
admitted
in
august
1949
that
he
falsified.
at
most,
he
stated
as
mr.
kammholz
argued
that
he
believed
in
the
principles
of
communism
which
to
him
meant
struggle
for
better
life
and
what
the
trade
union
movement
meant
to
him.
mr.
kammholz
then
go
on
to
the
--
to
another
section
of
that
statement
in
which
mr.
travis
said
that
he
had
never
believed
in
force
and
violence.
that
if
he
had
the
opinion
that
the
communist
party
believed
their
advocated
force
and
violence,
he
would
never
have
joined
it.
so
that
in
a
statement,
he
expressively
rejected
any
notion
that
--
that
the
statement
expressly
rejects
any
notion
that
he
was
lying
about
the
belief
provision
which
incidentally
has
never
been
passed
on
by
this
court
anyway.
it's
left
opened
in
the
douds
and
osman
cases.
so
that
here,
we
get
an
illustration
of
what
happens
when
an
administration
asserts
--
an
administrative
agency
asserts
an
implied
power
which
pass
no
limits
which
permits
it
to
--
to
conduct
what
it
calls
a
hearing,
an
administrative
hearing
instead
of
the
criminal
proceeding
with
all
the
safeguards
provided
by
section
1001
which
congress
said
is
specifically
applicable.
and
to
this
date
having
--
even
though
i
lived
with
this
case
ever
since
the
board
issued
its
original
order
in
february
1954,
i'm
still
not
certain
as
to
what
the
board
said
travis
admitted
in
that
statement
in
august
1949.
secondly,
and
i
won't
spend
any
time
on
this
point
because
it
was
discussed
somewhat
in
the
other
case.
the
board
went
on
to
find
that
since
he
his
admitted
that
as
1949
affidavit
was
false,
not
only
was
the
1950
affidavit
false.
it
goes
much
further
than
the
amalgamated
case
in
that
respect
but
that
all
of
the
affidavits
he
has
filed
until
1953,
a
total
of
seven
affidavits,
six
subsequent
to
the
one
filed
in
august
1949
were
also
false.
so
that
if
what
the
board
has
found
in
--
in
the
amalgamated
case
as
--
as
extreme,
it's
difficult
to
characterize
what
the
board
has
done
in
this
case
appropriately.
then
beyond
that,
in
this
case,
the
board
asserts
the
power
to
decomply
the
union
not
only
because
travis
admitted
the
falsity
or
i
should
say
in
addition
that
the
order
that
the
board
passed
in
february
1955,
not
only
decomply
the
union
as
far
as
the
period
from
august
1949
to
november
1953
was
concerned,
but
also
decomplied
the
union
with
respect
to
an
affidavit
which
was
filed
after
the
administrative
hearing
had
been
completed.
so
that
the
board
refused
to
give
effect
to
an
affidavit
filed
by
travis
in
october
1954
which
came
between
the
time
the
board
issued
its
order
starting
a
proceeding
and
the
time
it
issued
its
final
order
decomplying
the
union.
so
that
if
there's
any
question
as
to
whether
we
had
a
hearing
on
the
six
affidavits
filed
between
august
1949
and
november
1953,
there's
no
question
but
that
we
never
had
a
hearing
on
the
october
1954
affidavits.
now,
coming
to
the
question
of
membership,
i
wanted
to
ask
especially
in
view
of
the
limits
on
my
time,
i
--
i
--
all
i
think
i
may
do
to
begin
with
as
to
remind,
your
honors,
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question
to
mr.
kammholz
as
to
how
many
members
of
this
union
of
100,000
american
workers
were
aware
not
only
of
the
falsity
of
travis'
affidavit
in
august
1949,
but
were
aware
of
the
falsity
of
his
six
or
seven
--
take
your
choice,
affidavits.
and
the
board
of
course
has
never
spelled
that
out.
we
don't
know
whether
the
board's
finding
that
the
membership
was
aware
of
the
falsity
just
taking
not
only
the
august
1949
affidavit,
but
the
board's
concluding
finding
that
the
membership
was
aware.
that
means
all
100,000
members
in
august
1949
and
whether
the
different
100,000
in
--
in
december
1951
or
the
different
100,000
in
december
1952.
the
shifting
nature
of
union
membership
of
course
is
well
known.
mr.
nathan
witt
yes,
we
do
--
mr.
nathan
witt
--
mr.
justice
harlan,
we
do.
we
say
to
begin
with
that
the
--
the
board
doesn't
have
this
power
whether
it
--
it's
possible
to
show,
whether
--
mr.
nathan
witt
but
we
go
beyond
that
and
say
--
mr.
nathan
witt
that's
right,
your
honor,
which
in
effect
what
i'm
saying
to
your
honor
is
that
it's
an
impossible
concept.
congress
couldn't
have
been
attended
it.
mr.
nathan
witt
that
it
--
that
it
gets
pretty
close
to
--
to
insanity
as
powers
our
legal
processes
are
concerned,
how
you
determine
knowledge
of
100,000
people
of
(voice
overlap
)--
mr.
nathan
witt
no,
no.
of
course,
it
isn't.
just
one
other
point
on
this,
although
i
should
interrupt
myself
to
say
that
cautious
--
we
say
in
our
brief,
we
agree
with
mr.
kammholz
that
if
the
board
--
we
base
this
in
this
case
that
all
these
issues
are
open
below,
but
i'm
spending
the
--
this
time
on
the
facts
because
these
facts
illustrate
how
--
how
inconceivable
it
is
that
congress
intended
the
board
to
do
this
kind
of
a
job.
one
other
word
on
--
on
membership
awareness
--
mr.
nathan
witt
i'll
pass
that.
i
don't
think
that's
important
this
time.
just
a
few
final
words
on
--
the
basic
issue
in
this
case
as
far
as
collective
bargaining
and
stability
of
labor
relations
are
concerned.
the
effect
--
the
effect
of
decomplying
this
union
in
february
1955
if
the
decompliance
had
been
valid
on
the
statute
constitutionally,
would
have
been
to
so
open
to
question
--
not
so
open
to
question,
but
in
effect
to
invalidate
not
only
as
a
labor
board
proceeding
since
august
1949,
but
as
a
collective
agreement
which
this
union
had
made
with
the
copper
companies,
invested
in
non-ferrous
metal
industry
and
as
well
as
all
of
its
local
unions.
in
this
connection,
i
advert
back
to
the
act
of
1954.
that
act
does
not
operate
retroactively
the
way
the
board's
asserted
power
in
this
case
would
do.
it
acts
prospectively
so
that
the
union
is
not
out
of
compliance
or
doesn't
lose
its
status
as
a
labor
organization
until
the
order
of
the
sacp
is
final,
and
avoids
this
disastrous
consequence
even
if
you
overlook
shooting
the
shotguns
into
the
ranks
of
100,000
workers
as
put
in
the
court
below
if
you
impose
the
penalty
of
decompliance
on
the
members
of
the
union
because
an
officer
has
been
adjudged
injurious.
certainly,
in
light
of
the
basic
philosophy
of
the
wagner
act
and
the
taft-hartley
act,
it's
a
point
to
think
of
the
consequences
of
saying
that
all
of
this
union's
agreements
with
the
big
copper
companies
are
now
open
for
grabs
and
everything
we've
been
doing
these
last
few
years
under
these
agreements
have
been
implied.
thank
you.
