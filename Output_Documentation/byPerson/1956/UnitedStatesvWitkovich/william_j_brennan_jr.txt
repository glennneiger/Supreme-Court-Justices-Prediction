justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
tell
me
mr.
davis,
was
there
some
particular
reason
why
after
the
end
of
six
months,
he
had
to
stay
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
the
practice
mr.
davis,
ordinarily
to
--
to
deport
him
as
quickly
as
possible
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
six
months,
in
other
words,
is
set
aside
to
let
him
wind
up
his
personal
affairs.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
mean
i'm
--
but
the
statute
does
provide
for
--
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
but
if
it
--
if
--
but
he
may
have
up
to
six
months
to
wind
up
his
personal
affairs,
may
he
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
still
not
quite
clear
what
the
six
months
is
for.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
it's
not
--
it's
not
for
the
benefit
of
the
alien
himself.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
then
in
effect,
he's
released
but
then
somewhat
like
parole
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
who
are
under
supervision.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
until
he's
finally
deported.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
tell
me,
are
there
instances
in
which
the
--
the
attorney
general
does
not
confine
him
but
lets
him
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
either
case
after
the
six
months.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
davis,
let's
get
back
to
these
six
months.
what's
the
purpose
of
allowing
the
attorney
general
to
confine
for
six
months?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
if
i
may
interrupt
you
just
a
moment.
now,
basically,
the
idea
was
until
we
can
work
out
the
details
of
getting
them
out
of
here,
let's
keep
our
eyes
on
them,
have
them
somewhere
where
we
can
keep
our
eyes
of
them,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
i
take
it
the
obligation
at
the
end
of
six
months
to
release
on
the
supervisory
order,
that
doesn't
change
that
purpose
on
it,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
i
gather
your
position
is
we
have
to
focus
our
attention
on
what
was
done
here
inclusive
of
the
questions
that
were
asked
in
light
of
the
purpose
to
do
the
same
thing
that
confinement
initially
for
six
months
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
was
in
fact
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
me
ask
this.
the
--
does
it
make
any
difference
in
the
exercise
by
the
attorney
general
whether
or
not
to
confine
for
six
months
what
the
reason
was
that
the
alien
is
being
deported?
for
example,
as
i
understand
it,
there
might
be
a
deportable
alien.
we
had
a
case
argued
here
just
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
as
i
recall
it
that
involved
someone,
a
neutral
alien
who
had
sought
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
exemption
from
the
draft.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
in
this
case
however,
i
think
you
said
he
was
out
on
bail.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
long
at
--
at
all
during
the
six
months
period
was
he
confined?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
what
supervision
was
he
put
under
while
he
was
on
bail?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
my
point
is
that
he
was
allowed
to
roam
free
without
any
supervisions
for
six
months
on
a
$5000
bond.
it
seems
a
little
inconsistent
to
put
him
under
a
stringent
supervision
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
--
on
what
the
man
reads?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
have
some
trouble
following
that
at
least
for
the
six
months
period.
suppose
these
very
questions
were
imposed
that
in
connection
with
the
conditions
imposed
that
he
had
to
report
to
the
attorney
general
if
he
was
to
remain
on
bail.
and
the
question
were
put
to
him,
do
you
read
the
daily
worker?
and
he
said,
“i
won't
answer
it.”
and
they
said,
“all
right,
that's
your
bail
bond.
in
fact,
you
go
to
prison.”
would
he
have
any
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
think
he
would?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
he
had
--
suppose
he
had
after
he'd
been
ordered
deported
joined
in
the
communist
party,
would
he
have
committed
a
crime?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
i
ask
in
part
whether
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
any
other
that
you
refused
to
answer
that
demand
--
are
the
substantive
methods
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
--
they
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
scope
of
that,
are
there
references?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you
said
were
--
were
supervisory
agreement,
is
that
something
that
maybe
within
six
months
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
the
ordinary
part
of
this
that
they
will
not
part?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
ms.
hart,
why
was
he
deported?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
that
a
crime
at
that
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
davis,
the
most
two
important,
i'm
just
curious,
do
you
have
any
idea
why
they
dropped
out
that
question
on
the
chicago
tribune?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
it
seems
to
be
the
argument
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
should
think
the
vast
of
the
united
states
attorney
who
prosecuted
this
indictment
if
he
ever
has
to
the
trial,
i'd
be
glad
they
drop
it
too.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
didn't
--
didn't
he
testify
to
that
he
came
from
the
old
austro-hungarian
empire
and
where
he
came
from
that
wasn't
clear.
yugoslavia
recognized
that
he
was
now
a
yugoslavian.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
just
wondering
if
this
has
sustained
what
was
done
here
and
they
--
no
one
takes
them,
i
take
that
he
is
subject
to
this
kind
of
supervision
for
the
rest
of
his
life,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
suppose
no
one
takes
him.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
goes
through
this
the
rest
of
his
life.
