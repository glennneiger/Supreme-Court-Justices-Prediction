justice
john
m.
harlan
you
recognized
apparently
then
there
are
some
limits
to
the
--
despite
the
broad
--
to
determine
(inaudible)
the
statute.
there
are
several
limits
to
what
the
attorney
general
can
ask
under
his
judgment.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
what
are
those
limits?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
was
simply
to
deport
him,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
to
deport
him?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
it
really
comes
is
out
of
this
that
you
say
that
congress
as
respects
to
deport
an
alien,
to
subject
him
to
restrictions
in
the
interest
of
national
security
that
it
could
not
from
the
statutes
subject
to
a
citizenship.
justice
john
m.
harlan
excuse
me,
you
--
you
used
the
word
parole.
justice
john
m.
harlan
were
you
questioned
more
than
once?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
before
you
conclude
your
argument,
well
you
deal
with
the
carlson
case
and
how
you
distinguish
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
the
language
in
the
carlson
case
that
the
government
relies
on,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
in
fixing
bail
during
that
preview
for
--
or
the
pre-six
month
period,
they
can
--
the
judge
can
take
into
account
among
other
things
the
fact
during
the
national
security
which
would
seem
to
have
no
relationship
to
the
availability
of
the
man
as
a
deportee.
and
it's
that
language
that
i
would
suppose
that
you
â€“
you
wanted
to
deal
with.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
think
that
--
you
--
you
accept
carlson
for
the
preposition
that
even
though
the
attorney
general
says,
"i
find
there
is
no
security
risk
in
this
manner.
no
danger
of
you
not
showing
up
in
the
deportation,
and
nevertheless,
in
the
interest
of
national
security,
i'm
going
to
lock
them
up.
do
you
accept
carlson
for
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
if
you
accept
him
for
that,
then
you
got
some
trouble
in
this
case
i
think,
but
