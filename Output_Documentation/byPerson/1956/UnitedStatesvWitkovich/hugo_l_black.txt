justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
could
he?
the
statute
says
whether
or
not
related
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
as
the
attorney
general
deem
fit
and
proper.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
constitutional
ground,
not
the
statutory.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
let's
say
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
statute
contain
any
limitations
at
that
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
how
--
how
do
you
get
the
objects
of
the
act
limited
to
that?
if
it's
to
mean
like
object
to
act
is
except
that
you
give
some
subordinate
to
the
attorney
general.
this
is
done
by
a
subordinate,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what
if
you
call
people
in
and
ask
them
when
you
get
right
here
about
anything
if
they
want
to
ask
him.
that's
part
of
the
statute
concerned
kind
of
a
paternalistic
protection
(inaudible)
so
that
you
can
have
these
people
who
were
brought
in.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
may
be
all
right
but
that's
what
it
seems
to
me
it
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
deportation
order
is
over.
that's
--
we
--
that's
not
challenged,
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
only
question
here
now
is
this,
isn't
it?
this
man's
got
to
be
deported.
he
can't
be
deported
yet.
for
some
reason,
he
can't
get
him
in,
can
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he's
here.
the
statute
says
that
during
this
time
says
the
attorney
general
as
(inaudible)
but
whoever
he
designates
people
work
here
can
call
him
in
and
have
him
report
on
his
nationality,
circumstances,
address,
association
or
no
activities
and
such
other
information
whether
or
not
related
to
foregoing
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
where
do
you
find
anything
that
indicates
there
that
the
deportation
order
which
is
over
and
ready
to
be
executed
has
anything
to
do
with
the
objects
of
what
we
need
to
ask
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
don't
see
where
the
--
the
question
--
the
--
the
basis
for
the
deportation
has
anything
to
do
with
it.
i
don't
--
i
don't
see
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
it
had.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
than
he
is.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
--
what
do
you
have
here
is
a
man,
then
ordered
deported,
that's
finished.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
would
judge
if
what
they're
after
is
to
have
a
constant
fatherly
supervision
over
these
people
in
order
to
find
out
what
they're
doing
and
whether
they
go
to
the
movies
and
--
and
things
of
that
kind.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
suppose
this
man
could
have
declined
to
answer
the
--
whether
he's
going
to
the
movies
in
order
to
have
--
might
incriminate
him.
and
this,
certainly,
all
the
questions
you're
talking
about
if
he
hadn't
been
an
alien
and
subject
to
deportation,
i
would
say
that
it'll
be
a
little
different
to
make
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
just
ask
about
movies.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
have
you
been
to
any
movies
though
i'm
not
asking
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
he
hadn't
been
an
alien
ordered
deported
and
they
call
him
up
trying
to
make
him
tell
under
oath,
"what
would
do
to
the
blau
case
about
that?"
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
these
examinations
were
held
publicly
or
in
secret?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
--
does
the
attorney
general
have
authority
to
hold
him
secret?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
delighted
to
have
your
views
that
we
don't
have
to
apply
that
i'm
sure
it's
very
relevant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
as
interpreted
like
you
said.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it's
not
--
but
if
it's
not
yet
whether
if
it's
not
sustained,
where
do
we
go
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
--
if
judge
sullivan's
interpretation
is
not
accepted,
where
do
we
go
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
in
his
--
in
his
--
suppose
his
interpretation
is
not
accepted,
we
do
not
agree
that
--
that
what
he
said
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
all
you
can
ask
him
about
is
questions
concerning
his
availability.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
we
do
agree
with
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
i
said
suppose
we
disagree
with
judge
sullivan.
i'd
like
to
have
your
judgment
not
mine
or
anybody
else.
i'd
like
to
have
your
judgment
as
to
what
then
we
have
to
then
we
have
to
(inaudible)
something.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
say
carlson
stands
for
the
proposition
that
the
attorney
general
can
supervise
a
person
on
a
ground
that
he
might
be
a
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
does
it
follow?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
that
is
true,
does
it
follow
that
because
he
can
hold
a
man
further
without
bail,
he
refused
to
accept
this
case
that
he
could
turn
him
loose
later
under
an
order
if
he
say
he
had
to
be
out
and
then
he
could
then
do
anything
you
please
to
him
and
connects
him
with
supervision.
if
he
is
out,
the
basis
of
this
was,
as
i
understand
what
you
say
that
he
could
hold
him
in
jail
on
the
ground
that
he
might
be
--
name
this
person,
he
might
infiltrate
something.
but
here,
it's
been
held
that
the
statute
provides
that
he
is
let
out.
why
does
carlson
left?
why
does
it
follow
carlson
that
having
been
decided
that
he's
going
to
be
let
out
that
he
used
to
be
under
the
--
supervision
and
have
to
report
everyday
at
two
or
three
or
four
and
that's
all
the
question
there
is.
where
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
does
it
follow?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
you
accept
it
as
correct,
does
it
follow
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
this
period
after
the
six
months
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
when
the
congress
has
said,
he
can
be
turned
down.
he
must
be
turned
down.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
davis,
what
support
does
the
statute
get
from
the
fact
that
there's
been
a
deportation
offer?
why
is
that
necessary?
i
have
gathered
from
your
argument
that
it's
the
danger
of
security
division
to
give
authority
and
that's
based
on
the
fact
that
he
used
to
be
incompetent.
why
do
you
need
the
deportation
orders
for
the
statute
of
that
kind?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
aliens
who
have
--
they
have
been
ordered
deported
and
be
subject
to
the
supervision
of
government
agents,
why
cannot
other
aliens?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
provide
for
supervision,
the
power
of
the
attorney
general
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
asking
questions
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can't
myself
get
to
see
that
is
--
but
maybe
--
maybe
others
can
whether
there's
any
much
constitutional
support
added
to
the
statute
by
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
neither
because
of
the
deportation
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
i
think
that
they
brought
an
offer
to
this
supported
by
the
statute
itself.
