mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
with
respect
to
an
alien
who
has
been
ordered
deported
but
whose
deportation
has
not
been
accomplished,
the
government
may
exercise
supervision,
not
only
to
insure
his
availability
for
deportation
but
also
to
prevent
a
continuation
of
the
type
of
conduct
which
led
to
the
order
for
deportation.
in
the
present
case,
mr.
george
i.
witkovich,
the
alien,
was
indicted
for
refusing
to
answer
certain
questions
which
would
put
to
him
by
the
immigration
service.
he
had
earlier
been
ordered
deported
and
attempts
had
been
made
to
remove
him
to
yugoslavia.
however,
more
than
six
months
have
elapsed
since
the
order
of
deportation
and
the
deportation
had
not
been
accomplished.
meanwhile,
an
order
of
supervision
had
been
served
on
him
requiring
him
--
requiring
him
to
report
monthly
to
the
immigration
service,
not
to
change
his
residence
without
giving
notice
and
not
to
engage
in
communist
activities
or
to
associate
with
communists.
the
immigration
act
provides
that
an
alien
subject
to
a
supervisory
order
shall
give
information
under
oath
when
requested
with
respect
to
his
nationality,
his
habits,
circumstances,
his
associates
and
his
activities,
such
of
the
matters
as
the
attorney
general
may
deem
fit
and
proper.
in
an
attempt
to
find
out
whether
mr.
witkovich
was
continuing
his
activities
with
the
communists,
an
--
an
investigator
for
the
immigration
service
asked
him
a
serious
--
series
of
questions
dealing
with
his
associations
and
his
activities.
and
these
he
declined
to
answer,
not
claiming
--
specifically,
not
claiming
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment.
now
under
the
act,
it
is
a
crime
to
refuse
to
answer
such
questions
if
these
were
proper
questions.
mr.
witkovich
was
indicted.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
indictment
on
the
ground
that
the
statute
must
be
construed
to
permit
questions
which
deal
solely
with
the
alien's
availability
for
deportation.
and
since
the
questions
involved
did
not
deal
solely
with
this
question
but
rather
with
the
question
of
his
activities
and
associations
with
the
communist
party
that
the
indictment
was
dismissed.
and
since
this
--
the
dismissal
results
from
a
construction
of
the
statute,
we
are
here
on
direct
appeal.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
he
was
deported
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
for
membership
in
the
communist
party.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
since
the
case
is
properly
before
this
court,
there's
no
question
that
this
--
this
case
comes
up
properly
because
it
was
dismissed
on
that
ground.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
once
it
is
properly
--
a
proper
direct
appeal
to
this
court
then
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
would
be
--
would
be
before
the
court
if
the
court
decided
to
--
to
exercise
its
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
as
a
matter
of
practice
too,
although
i
can't
cite
you
cases,
but
then
--
then
i'm
sure
that
on
this
constitutionality
has
come
up
frequently
in
this
direct
appeals
on
--
on
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
it
is
a
different
question
but
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
the
question
would
be
whether
the
court
would
feel
that
if
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
whether
you
should
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
is
whether
or
not
you
feel
that
it
will
be
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
(inaudible)
the
statute
in
question
is
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952
and
specifically
section
242
(d)
which
we
have
read
it
at
pages
2
and
3
of
our
brief.
the
pattern
of
the
act
is
that
after
an
alien
is
arrested
for
deportation
proceedings,
the
attorney
general
may
within
his
discretion
keep
him
in
custody
for
the
duration
of
the
proceedings.
this
section
of
the
act
--
the
section
of
the
act
which
provides
this
was
the
section
which
was
before
this
court
in
carlson
against
landon
a
few
years
ago
where
the
constitutionality
of
the
detention
was
upheld
and
the
--
the
statute
was
interpreted
as
giving
the
attorney
general
authority
to
retain
the
alien
in
custody
when
it
was
necessary
in
the
--
for
the
welfare
of
the
country.
after
a
final
order
of
deportation
has
been
handed,
the
attorney
general
may
still
keep
the
alien
in
confinement
for
a
period
of
six
months
only
while
he
attempts
to
arrange
the
details
of
deportation.
when
the
six-month
period
has
ended
after
a
period
of
--
after
the
final
order
of
deportation,
the
attorney
general
no
longer
has
any
discretion
to
retain
the
alien
in
custody.
but
under
the
section
which
is
now
before
the
court,
the
attorney
general
is
authorized
to
place
the
alien
under
a
supervisory
order.
and
our
question
is
what
is
the
nature
of
that
supervision
and
is
that
supervision
constitutional?
mr.
john
f.
davis
he
hadn't
been
deported?
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
very
frequently
happens
in
these
communist
cases
that
it's
difficult
to
--
to
get
permission
from
the
foreign
country.
in
this
case,
his
country
was
yugoslavia.
application
had
been
made
to
the
consul
in
--
in
chicago
for
the
proper
papers.
they've
referred
it
to
yugoslavia
and
received
no
answer.
and
whenever
there
was
inquiry
made
as
to
what
happened,
they'd
say
we
haven't
heard
and
that
is
the
status.
mr.
john
f.
davis
without
--
without
the
--
without
the
deportation
being
accomplished
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
true.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
--
the
alien
frequently
doesn't
challenge
the
appropriateness
of
the
deportation
order
until
the
deportation
is
imminent
because
he
gains
additional
time
if
he
--
if
while
they're
arranging
for
the
deportation
he
doesn't
do
--
he
doesn't
challenge
it.
he
can
bring
it
up
on
habeas
corpus
when
the
time
comes
to
actually
deport
him.
so,
if
there
are
difficulties
in
arranging
for
the
deportation,
he
gets
the
additional
time
in
this
country
if
he
doesn't
pass
the
validity
of
the
order
until
the
actual
time
for
deportation
comes.
but
when
you
say
that
they
lie
dormant
in
the
services'
files,
i
think
that
--
that
shouldn't
be
--
we
shouldn't
be
--
i
shouldn't
be
construed
as
--
as
saying
that
the
services
in
attempting
to
process
this
file
isn't
attempting
to
deport
these
people.
it's
a
difficult
problem
and
--
and
they
haven't
finished
the
--
completed
the
deportation,
but
they
have
been
attempting
to.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
that
--
that
kind
of
inquiry
should
come
to
all
promptly.
it
may
be
that
there
are
other
steps.
maybe
there'd
been
applications
for
discretionary
relief
to
let
him
stay.
maybe
he
didn't
--
maybe
they
waited
until
the
time
it
became
imminent
before
they
asked
it.
i
--
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
don't
know
but
that
kind
of
query
i
should
think
should
come
soon
after
the
order
of
the
deportation.
i
see
no
excuse
for
it
being
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
very
much
explain
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
as
possible.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
that
--
well,
they
don't
--
there's
no
necessity
of
waiting
six
months.
he
has
no
right
to
remain
in
this
country
for
six
months.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
mean
the
amount
really
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
not
--
not
his
right.
the
--
the
statute
provides
--
the
attorney
general
may
keep
him
in
confinement
for
a
period
of
six
months
while
he's
making
arrangements
to
deport
him.
but
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
right
on
the
alien
to
remain
for
six
months
as
soon
as
the
order
becomes
final.
then
there
is
the
--
the
legal
right
to
deport.
i
--
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
service
acts
precipitantly
in
these
matters.
i
think
that
--
i'm
--
i
have
no
information
about
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
six
months
is
a
period
when
if
the
attorney
general
feels
it's
necessary
to
protect
the
country
from
a
continuation
of
the
activity
leading
to
deportations.
he
can
protect
the
country
by
holding
the
alien
in
confinement.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it's
not
for
the
benefit
of
the
alien
and
the
six
months
limitation
was
put
on
it
because
there
was
a
feeling
in
congress
that
there
would
be
constitutional
difficulties
in
holding
a
man
indefinitely
if
--
when
he
hasn't
been
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
the
background
of
this
provision
on
supervision
is
that
under
the
1917
act,
in
cases
where
aliens
had
been
ordered
deported,
there
was
just
--
and
we
--
they
haven't
been
able
to
accomplish
deportation.
there
was
no
control
over
them
or
whatsoever.
they
--
no
one
knew
where
they
were
and
what
they
were
doing.
and
meanwhile,
there
were
certain
eastern
european
countries
and
some
countries
in
the
far
east
who
were
refusing
to
take
back
aliens
which
had
been
ordered
deported
from
the
united
states.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
by
1950,
there
were
some
4000
aliens
who
have
been
ordered
deported
and
that
the
--
the
government
was
unable
to
accomplish
the
deportations.
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
yes.
in
this
case,
the
--
this
--
mr.
witkovich
was
--
was
--
well,
he
was
released
on
bail.
a
bail
was
provided
and
he
couldn't
make
the
bail,
so
before
the
proceedings,
he
was
actually
confined.
after
the
order,
however,
he
was
released
on
bail.
the
--
the
attorney
general
has
the
authority
in
that
six
months
period
to
confine
or
to
release
on
such
bond
as
he
believes
appropriate
and
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
after
the
six
months,
he
may
not
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
as
supervisory
on
him.
mr.
john
f.
davis
after
the
six
months,
he
has
authority
to
place
and
make
him
subject
to
a
supervisory
order,
this
type
of
order
which
we
have
before
us
now.
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
i
think
that
what
i've
said
to
mr.
justice
brennan
was
that
during
the
six
months
period,
he
may
not
and
very
frequently
--
most
frequently
does
not
retain
the
alien
in
custody
but
releases
him
on
bond
during
that
six
months
period
and
mr.
witkovich
himself
was
released
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
after
the
six
months,
he
must.
mr.
john
f.
davis
he
must.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
he
has
no
authority
to
keep
him
confined
after
the
six
months
period.
mr.
john
f.
davis
unless,
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
he's
convicted
of
a
crime
or
something.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
i
--
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
i
would
hate
to
have
to
defend
this
case
on
the
basis
of
that
question.
i
think
the
pertinence
of
it
is
that
in
the
communist
party,
the
--
the
members
are
encouraged,
perhaps
required
to
read
the
communist
literature.
however,
i
would
--
i
would
be
reluctant
to
have
to
defend
this
case
on
--
on
the
basis
of
that
particular
question
because
i
think
you
have
a
very
real
first
amendment
question.
people
have
the
right
to
print
the
daily
worker.
people
have
a
right
to
print
it.
we
shouldn't
be
--
they
shouldn't
be
prevented
from
reading
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
i
don't
think
we
do
rest
upon
that
question.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
i'd
rest
upon
the
question
as
to
associations
and
activities.
the
question,
are
you
a
member
of
the
communist
party
that
you
associate
with
so
and
so,
did
you
associate
with
so
and
so?
the
questions
accept
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
that
--
that
he
had
been
a
member
between
certain
days,
yes.
not
that
he
--
he
may
be
a
member.
there's
no
indication
whether
he
is
or
not.
that's
what
the
--
that's
what
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i'm
sorry
i
don't
know
what
--
on
the
pertinency
of
that
question
is.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i
have
no
idea
what
the
--
what
the
significance
of
that
question
is.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
i
don't
know
that
either.
i
presume
that
if
the
case
had
gone
on
for
trial,
it
would
have
had
to
be
the
judgment
would
have
to
set
aside
as
to
the
pertinency
of
any
questions
that
were
asked.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
they
must
be
consistent
with
the
--
with
the
object
of
the
--
of
the
supervision.
the
--
well,
specifically
let's
put
it
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
what?
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
no.
well,
i
think
that
the
supervision
is
not
only
to
deport
him
but
our
argument
here
is
that
congress
intended
the
attorney
general
to
have
power
to
inhibit
these
activities
which
led
to
the
deportation.
now,
in
this
case,
he
was
deported
because
it
would
prove
that
he
had
been
a
voluntary
member
of
the
communist
party
from
at
least
1940
to
1949
and
the
object
of
these
questions,
some
of
which
the
pertinence
of
which
i
--
i
have
no
idea,
but
the
presumed
object
of
this
was
to
find
out
whether
he
was
continuing
activities
in
connection
with
the
communist
party.
the
order
of
supervision
had
ordered
that
he
should
cease
to
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
it
didn't
make
him
anymore
deportable.
he
was
ordered
to
be
deported
and
could
be
deported
at
any
time
that
the
arrangements
could
be
made.
this
--
the
--
the
real
question
in
here
is
that
whether
--
in
order
to
prevent
--
well,
in
the
first
place,
the
--
does
the
--
does
the
government
have
a
right
to
prevent
this
kind
of
activities
by
aliens
who
were
deported?
if
so,
is
it
appropriate
to
do
it
by
confining
them
as
is
done
for
the
six
months
period
or
--
or
could
have
been
longer
by
statute.
or
is
it
appropriate
to
inhibit
this
type
of
activity
which
congress
believes
is
improper?
is
it
proper
to
inhibit
--
inhibited
by
this
type
of
parole
arrangement
and
requiring
reports
from
the
alien?
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
they
may
be.
i
think
that
it
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
--
that's
--
that's
exactly
the
problem.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
there's
a
strong
feeling
in
certain
congressmen
or
senators
that
the
way
to
protect
the
country
from
these
deportable
aliens
who
had
been
ordered
deported
was
to
confine,
keep
them
in
concentration
camps
or
--
or
somewhere
else
to
keep
them
under
control.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
doesn't
change
the
purpose,
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
that
is
right,
your
honor.
and
that
question
--
the
question
would
be
the
same.
is
confinement
solely
for
the
purpose
of
making
the
alien
available
at
the
dock
at
the
time
you
want
him
to
go
or
is
the
confinement
intended
also
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
this
kind
of
activity
by
which
he
is
being
before
this?
mr.
john
f.
davis
suggested
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
--
it'd
make
a
very
great
difference
what
--
what
the
--
what
the
reason
for
deportation
was.
this
--
this
question,
mr.
justice
brennan,
of
--
of
when
and
how
the
attorney
general
should
exercise
his
authority
was
taken
up
rather
exhaustively
in
this
court
and
in
carlson
against
landon,
the
statute
which
says
that
the
attorney
general
was
given
authority
to
detain
the
alien
during
the
proceeding
and
the
question
was
raised
there.
is
the
purpose
of
the
detention
in
order
to
make
him
available
or
is
it
a
broader
purpose?
and
i
may
say
that
both
the
majority
and
a
dissent
and
there's
a
strong
dissent
from
the
case.
both
the
majority
and
the
dissent
referred
to
the
element
of
safeguarding
the
security
of
united
states
from
his
activities,
not
being
sure
that
if
he's
here
he's
here
too
much,
but
safeguarding
the
united
states
from
his
activities.
and
that
was
considered
by
this
court
to
be
a
proper
element
in
the
--
in
retaining
him
in
custody.
and
if
i
may
say
so,
it's
the
--
it's
really
the
strongest
part
of
my
argument
this
morning
that
if
it
is
a
proper
element
in
considering
whether
or
not
to
--
to
keep
the
man
confined,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
element
of
security
of
preventing
him
from
carrying
on
these
activities
is
a
proper
element
of
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
he
was
out
on
bail.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
don't
think
he
was
confined
at
any
time
during
the
six
months.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
i
don't
know
what
the
conditions
of
the
bond
were.
they're
not
on
the
record
and
i
do
not
know
them.
he
was
released
on
a
--
on
a
$5000
bond
and
i
don't
know
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
--
well,
that
may
be
so.
i
--
i
--
it
--
although
the
attorney
general
was
given
authority
in
these
cases
to
--
to
change
his
position
to
release
the
man
without
bond
and
then
to
put
him
on
--
under
bond
it's
that
he's
not
--
the
attorney
general
waives
no
--
no
authority
in
this
matter
by
not
imposing
a
condition
in
the
first
place.
it
may
--
it
may
raise
a
question
and
in
our
minds
as
to
whether
the
--
the
condition
is
necessary.
but
it's
not
a
question
of
--
of
authority.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
think
it
must
depend
on
--
on
the
particular
statute
involved,
generally
speaking.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
in
this
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
in
this
--
in
this
case,
the
--
the
bond
is
i
think
these
would
be
proper
conditions
for
the
--
for
the
bond
on
the
release
during
the
six
months.
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
i
think
that
this
would
be
and
i
think
the
terms
of
the
bond
would
--
would
receive
contempt
from
this
later
supervisor
--
supervisory
order,
the
provision
for
the
supervisory
order.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
this
bond
with
one
--
with
one
amendment,
that
this
bond
is
provided
by
the
attorney
general
not
by
the
court
i
mean
in
this
period.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
that's
--
and
my
answer
was
the
attorney
general
could
but
i
think
he
should
in
these
circumstances.
mr.
john
f.
davis
in
fact,
mr.
brennan's
question
would
indicate
that
it
--
we've
done
it
against
it
--
against
the
supervisory
order
if
he
didn't.
mr.
john
f.
davis
generally
speaking,
yes.
they
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
i
mean
i
can't
say
that
they
have
these
precise
terms
in
them
but
that
is
the
practice
to
condition
and
have
the
bond
conditioned
on
--
on
similar
terms.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
--
i
do
not
know
that
it
does
--
the
supervisory
order
in
this
case
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
reading.
and
a
investigator
for
the
immigration
service
asked
whether
he
had
read
it
and
i'm
willing
to
concede
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument
that
he
could
that
--
to
refuse
to
answer
that
question.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
think
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
think
it
was
an
improper
question
and
he
could
then
refuse
to
answer
it
because
it
infringed
on
his
rights
under
the
first
amendment
just
as
he
could
have
refused
possibly
on
some
of
the
other
questions
on
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
well,
statutorily
that
may
be
a
real
pertinence
in
asking
him
whether
he's
read
--
whether
he
reads
the
daily
worker,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
davis
constitutionally,
i'm
not
sure
that
the
--
that
relevancy
should
be
called.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
he'd
have
the
right
in
habeas
corpus.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
would
think
so.
i
would
think
it
was
an
impassive
--
that
if
you
read
the
question
back
into
the
bonds,
i
don't
think
it
is
a
proper
question.
i
think
that's
the
trouble
with
it
but
if
you
read
it
back
into
the
bond
and
then
he
had
a
right
to
refuse
to
answer
and
there
was
an
improper
condition
then
he
could
be
released
on
habeas
corpus.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
this
might
--
our
basic
argument
in
this
case,
your
honor
is
that
this
isn't
--
this
isn't
a
punishment.
we're
not
punishing
the
--
the
alien
by
putting
him
under
this
restraint.
he
is
--
he
is
a
--
a
person
who
congress
has
said
is
conducting
himself
in
such
a
way
that
he
should
be
deported
that
this
activity
is
what
we
do
not
want
aliens
to
do.
now,
congress
doesn't
say
that
it's
a
crime
that
alien
--
aliens
do
these
things.
they
just
say
that
if
people
are
going
to
stay
on
this
country
and
retain
that
foreign
citizenship,
there
are
certain
things
that
if
they
do
them,
we
feel
they
should
leave
the
country.
one
of
those
things
that
they
feel
aliens
should
not
do
is
to
associate
--
did
join
the
communist
party
and
associate
with
the
communist,
you
know
that
congress
whose
intention
on
this
is
perfectly
clear
in
the
internal
security
act
and
in
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
think
that
is
probably
so.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
there
--
there
is
no
question
that
aliens
here
are
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
first
amendment.
and
--
and
i
don't
know
what
other
constitutional
rights,
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
you
can't
take
an
alien
and
fine
for
murder
without
a
jury.
they're
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
constitution
as
anybody
else
is.
the
question
is
whether
this
is
an
unreasonable
restraint
on
this
man's
liberty
that
to
require
him
to
report,
to
require
him
to
answer
questions
under
these
circumstances.
and
our
point
is
basically
this.
that
if
it
is
--
if
it
is
a
legal
thing,
it's
a
constitutional
thing
to
say
this
is
so
bad
that
the
man
shall
be
sent
out
of
the
country.
if
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
which
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
this
court
has
said,
he
can
be
retained
in
custody
while
you
--
while
you
--
confined,
while
you're
--
while
you're
deciding
it.
it
certainly
is
the
kind
of
thing
where
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
say
that
we
shall
have
this
kind
of
a
supervision,
this
general
supervision
with
respect
to
his
activities.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
although
i
may
say
that
specifically
that
question
with
respect
to
questions
during
the
six
months
is
not
before
the
court
but
that's
--
i
mean
except
there's
a
--
is
it
relevant
in
our
--
our
--
in
our
logic
on
it.
but
i
think
that
that
is
so.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
--
i
was
about
--
i
was
about
to
go
into
the
statutory
question
because
the
courts
below
found
that
this
act
--
this
act
gave
authority
to
the
attorney
general
only
to
ask
questions
with
respect
to
the
alien's
availability,
availability
for
deportation.
and
these
questions
obviously
have
nothing
to
do
or
are
only
collaterally
relevant
to
whether
he
will
be
present
when
the
time
comes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i'm
sure
he
would
say,
“that's
all
right.”
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
was.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
let
me
say.i
think
they
ought
to
be
related
to
the
order
of
supervision
and
--
and
the
supervision
must
order
--
a
supervision
must
be
a
--
a
reasonable
one.
there
must
be
some
basis
for
it.
it
is
possible
that
an
alien
would
be
--
would
have
been
deported
for
--
of
some
crimes,
sexual
misbehavior
or
something
and
he
also
may
have
a
record
of
being
associated
with
--
with
the
communist
party.
and
i
think
it
would
be
entirely
appropriate
even
though
he
was
being
deported
for
some
other
crimes
if
he
has
a
record
of
association
with
the
communist
party
that
the
supervisory
order
take
that
into
consideration.
but
it's
not
present
in
this
case
because
in
this
case,
he
was
ordered
deported
for
--
for
associate
--
for
the
communist
activity.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
under
--
as
a
supervisory
order,
i
think
that
is
--
is
that's
right.
i
that
--
this
have
to
have
some
relations
to
the
man's
background
that
would
have
to
deal
with
narcotics.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
if
it
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
it's
a
matter
of
reasonable
cause.
if
the
attorney
general
had
any
reason
to
believe,
these
orders
should
have
some
reference
to
the
--
as
that
the
court
said
in
carlson
against
landon,
you
couldn't
look
at
the
--
the
case
to
find
out
what
is
necessary
in
order
to
protect
the
--
the
welfare
of
the
united
states
with
respect
to
these
aliens.
now,
if
the
man
is
convicted
of
narcotics
and
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
he's
engaged
in
--
in
communist
activities,
it's
not
reasonable
to
put
him
under
restrictions
at
that
time
with
respect
to
membership
in
the
communist
party.
there's
just
no
--
no
reason
to
--
to
restrict
his
liberty.
however,
if
there
is
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
that's
his
activities
will
extend
in
that
direction
i
should
think
it
was
well
within
the
authority
of
the
attorney
general
to
--
to
issue
a
supervisory
order
and
that
with
--
with
that
respect.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
i
would
think
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
that
would
be
my
position.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
he
has
the
right
to
inquire
about
them,
yes,
but
if
you're
going
to
convict
the
man
of
crime
who's
not
answering,
if
there
was
no
reason
--
if
the
question
was
an
unreasonable
question
or
if
it
violated
his
constitutional
rights,
he
has
the
right
to
refuse
to
answer.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
in
fact
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
anytime
that
which
he
had
reasonable
cause
to
believe
would
--
would
interfere
--
would
impinge
on
the
safety
of
the
--
of
the
nation.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
it
says
--
it
says
any
other
--
any
other
matters
whether
related
to
the
foregoing
or
not
which
the
attorney
general
deems
fit
and
proper.
and
may
i
say
that
i
read
that
limitation
into
the
statute
in
the
same
way
that
this
court
read
the
limitation
and
into
the
confinement
provisions
in
carlson
against
landon
where
the
court
said
that
the
confinement
must
be
read
with
reference
to
the
objects
of
the
act.
and
so
we
build
these
questions,
these
--
the
supervision
and
the
questions
must
be
related
to
the
objects
of
the
act.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
it
was
done.
the
questioning
was
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
done
by
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
but
its
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
you're
quite
right,
your
honor,
that
there
is
no
limitation
in
--
in
the
words
of
the
statute
as
to
what
questions
can
be
asked.
if
one
reads
to
this
the
--
this
--
this
language
in
--
in
the
light
of
the
entire
statute,
one
must
assume
he's
going
to
ask
questions
which
are
in
accordance
with
the
--
the
purpose
of
the
statute
just
as
in
the
carlson
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
against
landon
case.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
the
history
of
the
--
of
the
purpose
of
--
of
supervising
is
that
aliens
who
had
been
ordered
deported
because
of
activities
which
were
considered
improper
for
aliens,
they've
been
ordered
sent
out
of
this
country
were
still
here,
4000
doing,
presumably
free
to
do
precisely
the
same
things
that
they've
been
ordered
sent
out
of
the
country
for.
now,
congress
said,
"how
are
we
going
to
deal
with
this?
shall
we
prevent
these
aliens
from
--
from
doing
this
conduct
which
we
believe
antisocial
shall
we
prevent
it
by
--
by
keeping
them
in
--
in
confinement
or
shall
we
somehow
try
and
keep
an
eye
on
them,
something
more
elastic?
let
them
live
with
their
families.
let
them
continue
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
within
their
work
(inaudible)
but
keep
an
eye
on
them
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
but
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
to
prevent
them
from
doing
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
what
the
movie
in
question
was
and
i
don't
know
what
the
evidence
would
have
been
that
the
court
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
had
wanted
to
have.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
would
--
i
would
support
if
it
--
if
--
if
pressed.
i
would
support
this
case
particularly
on
the
questions
which
deal
with
are
you
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
if
he
--
if
this
man
had
claimed
the
privilege
against
incrimination
as
it
was
done
in
the
blau
case,
then
you
would
have
the
question
of
whether
he
had
the
constitutional
right
of
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
i'm
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
did
well
anticipate
what
the
court
would
do
with
the
question.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
specifically,
he
did
not
claim
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
john
f.
davis
in
these
--
these
are
held
publicly
and
counsel
was
present.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
whether
he
does
not
or
not.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
don't
believe
so.
in
this
particular
case,
the
evidence
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
counsel
was
present
in
representing
(inaudible)
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
first
place
to
look
for
the
meaning
of
the
statute
i
think
is
the
word
statute
itself.
and
my
first
argument
therefore
would
be
that
it
isn't
reasonable
to
read
these
words
that
the
--
he
must
give
information
under
oath
with
respect
to
his
habits,
associations
and
activities
as
words
which
would
be
designed
to
show
whether
or
not
he
was
--
would
be
available
on
the
dock
for
deportation.
they've
sound
to
--
they
sound
like
words
that
you
would
ask
an
alien
to
find
out
what
he
was
doing
rather
than
whether
or
not
he
was
going
to
be
available
to
be
deported.
mr.
john
f.
davis
under
the
supervisory
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
order,
he
is
given
--
he
is
given
authority
to
associate
with
his
wife
and
his
counsel
even
though
they
may
be
communists.
it's
accepted
from
the
--
from
the
supervisory
order.
the
second
--
the
second
clue
we
have
to
the
meaning
of
this
language
is
its
--
its
location
in
the
statute.
it
--
it
follows
--
this
section
follows
immediately
after
the
section
dealing
with
retaining
an
alien
in
custody.
and
as
i
mentioned
before,
that
section
was
before
this
court
in
carlson
against
landon
342
u.s.524.
and
presumably
that
the
purposes
of
the
strict
custody
of
--
of
retaining
a
man
in
confinement
and
the
elastic
custody
that
can
be
called
out
of
--
of
the
supervisory
order
are
--
are
related.
and
this
court
--
this
court,
both
the
majority
and
the
minority,
specifically
interpreted
the
custody
provisions
as
in
--
as
authorizing
the
attorney
general
to
keep
the
man
in
confinement
if
he
had
reason
to
believe
that
it
was
necessary
for
the
security
of
the
united
states.
and
the
third
way
to
find
out
the
meaning
of
this
statute
i
suppose
is
the
legislative
history
and
we
speak
with
it
at
some
length
in
our
brief.
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
from
1939
and
1950,
representative
holmes
pressed
for
legislation
to
protect
the
country
from
deportable
aliens,
not
only
submissives,
but
other
aliens
guilty
of
other
--
of
other
offenses
to
protect
the
country
from
--
of
their
presence
here
when
they've
been
ordered
deported
and
couldn't
be
deported.
and
when
he
was
finally
able
to
--
to
get
this
enacted
into
law
was
when
the
internal
security
act
was
passed.
this
provision
was
originally
a
section
of
the
internal
security
act
and
it
this
was
well
known,
the
prime
object
of
that
act
was
to
protect
this
country
against
communist
activities.
now,
in
the
legislative
history,
we
have
a
presidential
message.
we
have
a
recommendation
from
the
department
of
justice.
we
have
reports
from
the
judiciary
committees
of
both
houses.
we
have
statements
by
representative
holmes
on
--
on
from
the
floor.
and
they
all,
without
exception,
tie
the
supervision
of
these
aliens
in
with
the
question
of
their
continued
antisocial
activity
rather
than
with
their
availability
for
deportation.
and
if
there
were
--
if
there
were
further
need
for
--
for
interpreting
the
statute,
i
might
point
out
that
this
provision
was
reenacted
by
congress
in
1952.
it
originally
passed
as
part
of
the
internal
security
act
in
1950.
after
that,
this
court
construed
the
custody
provisions
in
carlson
against
landon.
and
after
that,
the
court
reenacted
--
the
congress
reenacted
the
section
in
1952
so
that
we
have
here
a
case
of
reenactment
of
--
of
this
provision
after
interpretation
by
the
court.
it
seems
--
it
seems
clear
to
me
that
the
court
below
must
have
reached
its
interpretation
because
it
felt
that
unless
it
limited
the
statute
to
availability
for
deportation,
it
would
have
grave
constitutional
questions
as
to
whether
that
was
a
power
under
the
constitution
to
--
to
hold
the
--
to
hold
the
alien.
but
i
think
it's
of
somewhat
doubtful
humanity
to
mutilate
a
statute
by
cutting
off
two
arms
and
a
leg
in
order
to
uphold
the
remnant.
if
we
are
right,
the
congress
clearly
intended
the
attorney
general
to
have
power
--
supervisory
power
over
activity,
by
then
the
court
was
stepping
into
the
legislative
field
when
it
interpreted
the
statute
as
it
did.
and
it
seems
--
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
the
statute
as
written
is
constitutional.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
as
--
as
written
and
as
--
as
interpreted
by
the
court
in
carlson
against
landon
which
i
translate
to
this
case.
the
basic
constitutional
issue
is
--
and
the
appellee
restates
it
in
--
in
many
guises,
but
the
basic
constitutional
issue
is
whether
the
exercise
of
supervisory
restraints
over
these
aliens
deprives
them
of
liberty
without
due
process
of
law.
the
argument
is
that
they
have
not
been
found
guilty
of
any
crime
and
indeed
this
alien
hasn't
been
found
guilty
--
guilty
of
any
crime.
and
that
therefore,
any
attempt
to
restrict
his
activity
is
a
punishment
which
is
imposed
upon
him
without
indictment,
jury
trial
or
the
other
safeguards
of
the
criminal
law.
and
if
these
were
a
punishment,
if
the
aim
and
--
and
the
result
of
this
kind
of
a
supervisory
order
were
a
punishment,
i
believe
the
statute
would
be
unconstitutional.
in
similar
situation,
the
--
the
--
this
court
upset
a
--
a
immigration
act
way
back
in
1896
in
wong
wing
against
united
states
which
was
a
case
of
imprisoning
chinese
without
jury
trial,
without
any
trial
in
administrative
imprisonment.
and
the
court
had
no
difficulty
in
saying
that
that
was
a
punishment
and
that
it
should
--
that
the
--
and
was
unconstitutional.
but
the
--
this
type
of
restraint
which
we
have
in
this
case
is
not
imposed
as
--
as
a
punishment.
it
is
imposed
because
there
is
some
necessity
of
--
of
preventing
aliens
which
have
been
found
engaged
in
antisocial
activities
and
ordered
deported
from
continuing
to
perform
the
same
activities
in
the
interim
before
they
can
finally
be
removed.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
that's
not
quite
so.
i
mean
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
the
supervisory
order
orders
the
alien
not
to
engage
in
communist
activities
and
not
to
associate
with
communists.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
if
he
does
associate
with
communists,
if
he
does
participate
in
communist
activity,
he
violates
the
supervisory
order
which
is
also
a
crime
and
he
can
go
to
jail
for
one
year.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
isn't
in
question
here
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
on
--
on
the
query,
on
the
question?
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
--
that's
right.
he
can.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
it
depends
where
you've
kept
--
where
you've
kept
the
question
off.
i
--
i
have
approached
the
--
the
questions
as
part
of
the
general
supervisory
scheme
because
i
think
they
are
an
inherent
part
of
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
gain
strength
from
it
then
it
gains
strength
from
them
that
they're
almost
indivisible.
but
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
think
you're
right,
your
honor.
i
think
the
narrow
question
before
us
is
simply
the
question
of
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
reason
that
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
unless
--
unless
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
--
but
unless
these
questions
--
i
may
be
arguing
slightly
against
myself
but
unless
these
questions
have
some
relevance
to
a
supervisory
order
which
is
proper,
by
then,
it
would
seem
that
the
attorney
general
had
no
--
there
were
no
restrictions
on
his
right
to
ask
questions.
and
so
i
find
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
then
is
it
proper
to
ask
a
man
questions.
that's
--
that's
the
narrower
question
before
this
court.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
that
is
the
narrowest
ground
on
which
this
can
be
sustained.
i
would
--
i
would
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
or
not
sustained.
i
--
i'm
arguing
on
this
private
offense.
mr.
john
f.
davis
make
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
if
it's
not
--
if
these
questions
are
not
sustained
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
in
that
case
since
the
indictment
is
dismissed
then
i
suppose
then
it's
a
question
of
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
(inaudible)
mr.
john
f.
davis
if
--
if
it
is
--
if
it
were
--
certainly,
if
--
if
this
court
should
uphold
judge
sullivan
on
the
ground
that
only
questions
with
respect
to
availability
were
--
were
properly
asked,
i
would
assume
that
was
an
interpretation
by
this
court
if
that
was
the
purpose
of
supervision
and
that
the
entire
supervision
would
be
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
limited
to
availability.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
it's
also
unconstitutional
to
ask
these
questions.
mr.
john
f.
davis
then
you
have
to
pass
upon
the
constitutionality
of
asking
--
of
requiring
of
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
said
that
you've
had
--
excuse
me
your
honor.
i
was
about
to
say
that
you'd
have
to
pass
upon
the
constitutionality
of
giving
the
attorney
general
the
authority
to
ask
these
questions
and
make
the
answer
of
crime.
and
that's
the
narrow
question
that
you
would
be
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
you
are
quite
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
my
--
my
mind
didn't
advert
to
the
--
the
question
of
whether
you
would
return
it
to
the
lower
court.
