m.

if
the
court
please.
i
would
like
to
say
at
the
threshold
that
it
is
all
together
likely
that
this
case
would
not
be
before
your
honors
and
i
would
not
be
here
this
afternoon
if
i
had
advised
my
client
to
plead
the
fifth
amendment
in
relation
to
the
questions
which
were
asked
of
him.
but
the
integrity
of
the
client
and
devotion
to
the
proper
administration
of
the
law
did
not
permit
us
to
indulge
in
any
subterfuges.
and
therefore,
whatever
answers
we
refuse
to
give,
our
position
was
that
the
questions
were
in
violation
of
our
rights
under
the
first
amendment
and
also
that
the
questions
were
not
pertinent
to
any
issue.
and
we
feel
that
we
have
a
complete
right
to
protection
for
ourselves
under
the
first
amendment
just
as
much
as
we
have
under
any
other
amendment
to
the
constitution.
i
would
like
to
say
too
that
briefly
on
the
question
of
the
right
of
supervision
because
that's
the
point,
i
think,
in
which
we
left
that
the
kind
of
supervision
attempted
here
would
be
all
together
feudal
under
almost
any
circumstances
that
we
can
conceive.
for
instance,
if
this
defendant,
when
called
upon
by
the
person
in
the
naturalization
service,
had
bared
his
life
completely
from
the
cradle
to
the
present
time
and
had
told
all
about
himself,
and
nevertheless
said,
"yes,
i
still
am
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
i
still
go
to
meetings
of
the
communist
party."
what
assistance
would
that
had
been
to
the
attorney
general
in
the
so-called
supervision
or
what
could
the
attorney
general
have
done
having
that
information
before
him?
on
the
other
hand,
suppose
the
defendant
had
taken
the
position
that
he
refused
to
answer
on
the
basis
of
the
fifth
amendment,
how
would
the
attorney
general
have
been
assisted
in
this
so-called
supervision
of
the
defendant.
in
neither
event,
would
anything
happen
then,
it
would
have
been
a
feudal
act
as
far
as
the
order
supervision
is
concerned.
and
while
that
should
not
be
determinative
of
the
entire
proposition,
nevertheless,
on
the
mere
argument
of
the
supervision,
it
gets
the
court
nowhere
in
my
opinion.
another
matter
to
which
i
want
to
call
your
attention
preliminarily
is
this,
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
indictment
and
the
indictment
has
to
be
considered,
i
believe,
by
this
court
from
its
four
corners.
there's
nothing
in
the
indictment
which
has
any
reference
at
all
to
communist
party
membership
or
engaging
in
communist
and
activities.
it
is
a
general
indictment
which
says
that
the
defendant
who
is
then
and
there
and
the
alien
against
whom
an
order
of
deportation
had
issued
and
been
outstanding
for
more
than
six
months,
which
said
order
of
deportation
was
then
and
there,
a
final
order
having
become
final
on
a
certain
day
and
who
is
the
project
from
the
united
states
under
the
order
of
deportation
had
not
been
affected
with
in
such
six-month
period
and
who
was
then
and
there
pending
eventual
deportation
subject
to
supervision
was
required
to
come
in
and
answer
questions,
et
cetera
and
he
refused
to
answer
the
following
questions.
now,
are
we
to
assume,
and
i'm
not
making
a
great
point
over
because
i
suppose
you
might
as
well
meet
the
whole
situation
squarely,
are
we
to
assume
from
this
that
all
of
these
matters
in
relation
to
communist
party
activity
are
pertinent
to
this
particular
kind
of
an
indictment
because
there's
nothing
in
it.
now
then,
they
proceed
to
give
the
questions
which
it
was
said
he
refused
to
answer.
and
the
first
question
you
will
notice
is,
"do
you
subscribe
to
the
daily
worker?"
i
would
like
to
tell
you,
and
that
does
happened
to
be
part
of
the
record,
that
the
question
which
immediately
preceeded
it
was,
"do
you
rate
the
chicago
daily
tribune?"
well,
of
course,
we
objected
to
answering
that
under
the
first
amendment
just
the
same
as
we
objected
to
answering
in
regard
to
the
daily
worker.
however,
we're
not
being
embedded
for
not
answering
as
to
whether
we
read
the
daily
tribune
or
not.
all
of
these
questions
--
i
think
there
are
22
questions
contained
in
the
indictment
which
we
--
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
pardon.
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
yes,
i
believe
there
are.
i
--
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
--
i
can't
point
them
out
at
this
moment
unless
i
go
through
the
entire
series
of
questions,
your
honor.
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
yes.
it's
all
in
--
in
the
record
and
the
--
all
of
the
questions,
your
honor,
we'll
find
on
page
--
beginning
on
page
32
of
the
transcript.
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
ninety
five
questions
in
total
were
asked.
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
and
he
refused
to
answer
22.
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
yes,
he
refused
to
answer
that
too,
your
honor,
because
we
saw
no
purpose
of
it
as
to
whether
or
not
he
could
translate
or
read
several
languages.
we
felt
he
had
no
pertinency
at
all
to
the
proposition
of
this
having
to
be
deported.
we
thought
there
was
no
pertinency
to
a
number
of
other
questions
which
were
asked
now.
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
some
of
the
questions
were
answered.
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
no,
the
line
was
drawn
at
that
time
and
we
said
at
that
time
that
certain
questions
we
refused
to
answer
because
either
they
were
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
or
they
were
not
pertinent
to
any
right
that
the
attorney
general
had
or
to
any
issue
which
was
involved.
that
was
done
at
the
time
of
the
questioning
and
there
is
nothing
new
added
to
it
at
this
time,
your
honor.
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
i
was
counsel
--
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
--
present
at
that
time.
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
yes,
i
have
no
hesitancy
as
to
that.
and
for
instance,
you
will
find
that
we
answered
about
70
questions
which
have
to
do
with
these
matters,
"where
do
you
live?
do
you
own
a
property?
where
do
you
work?
how
many
hours
a
day
do
you
work?
what
do
you
do
with
your
spare
time?
how
many
children
have
you,
have
your
wife?
we
have
five
children,
we
have
a
wife.
they
are
all
born
in
the
united
states.
one
son
was
a
member
of
the
armed
forces.
all
of
those
questions
which
have
anything
to
do
with
the
possibility
of
putting
a
hand
on
the
individual
as
soon
as
deportation
is
possible
were
answered.
at
no
time,
did
the
attorney
general
have
to
guess
about
our
location
or
whereabouts,
the
place
of
employment,
how
much
we
earn,
whether
we
own
real
estate,
how
much
the
mortgages
on
the
real
estate.
we
have
no
--
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
i
had
no
hesitancy
in
advising
him
to
answer
all
those
questions
which
would
properly
inform
the
attorney
general
where
he
was
at
all
times,
although
of
course,
the
attorney
general
knows
where
he
is
anyway
but
i
had
no
purpose.
now,
when
they
asked
this,
"do
you
know
so
and
so,
john
smith,
william
jones,
et
cetera,
et
cetera?"
i
don't
know
who
those
people
are,
but
we
also
felt
that
they
were
not
pertinent
to
any
right
which
the
attorney
general
had.
why?
because
he
told
what
labor
union
he
belonged
to.
he
told
where
he
worked
and
that
he's
been
working
there
for
two
years
and
more.
he
told
where
he
lived,
where
he
earned
property
and
where
his
children
and
wife
lives.
so
that
there
was
no
difficulty
on
the
part
of
the
attorney
general
at
any
moment
at
all
to
locate
him
and
we
felt
that
that
was
all
that
was
necessary.
now,
of
course,
we
wouldn't
have
been
heard
if
we
had
told
him
whether
we
can
speak
more
than
one
language.
and
we
wouldn't
have
been
heard
if
we
had
told
him
whether
we
read
the
tribune
or
the
daily
worker.
but
on
the
question
of
principle
and
viewing
to
the
line,
we
felt
he
had
no
right
to
ask
those
questions.
and
therefore,
we
refused
to
answer
on
the
two
grounds
like
the
pertinency
and
also
the
first
amendment
which
we
trust
this
court.
we'll
consider
it
in
relation
to
the
--
the
whole
situation.
now,
your
honors,
there
--
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
you
mean
his
activity
outside
of
his
occupation?
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
oh,
i
do
not
know
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
at
all
to
indicate
who
they
are.
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
no,
i
would
not.
now,
whether
he
knew,
i'm
not
in
position
to
say
it.
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
it's
not
--
there's
nothing
in
the
record
about
that
at
all.
now,
when
they
asked
him,
"do
you
know
the
editor
of
so-and-so?"
we
think
that's
impertinent
to
the
issue.
when
they
asked
him,
"what
is
the
policy
of
the
newspaper
for
which
you
worked
as
a
pressman?"
we
refused
to
answer
because
that
has
no
pertinency
to
anything.
and
certainly,
we're
--
we're
not
required
to
know
what
the
policy
of
a
newspaper
is
for
whom
we
work
merely
as
a
pressman.
so
all
down
the
line,
we
distinguish
between
those
things
which
we
felt
that
the
attorney
general
had
a
proper
right
to
inquire
into
--
in
those
things
which
had
no
pertinency
to
the
issue.
and
on
the
question
of
communist
party
membership,
if
the
court
please,
precisely
the
same
thing,
and
as
far
as
the
first
amendment
is
concerned,
we
think
we
have
a
complete
right
to
rely
on
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment
in
connection
with
that.
but
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
supposed
he
had
said
that
he
was
still
a
member
or
suppose
he
had
taken
the
fifth
and
said,
"it's
none
of
your
business
because
the
fifth
protects
me."
what
would
have
availed
the
attorney
general
in
respect
for
that?
now,
those
are
just
by
way
of
preliminary,
if
your
honors
please.
and
i
would
like,
if
i
possibly
can
to
go
into
a
summary
of
the
other
matters
which
we
relate
--
indicate
the
miscellaneous
frailties
in
the
whole
situation.
the
statute
itself
or
that
section
of
the
statute
itself,
it
cannot,
in
my
humble
opinion,
be
regarded
as
a
constitutionally
collectible
because
it
is
so
vague
that
it's
impossible
for
anybody
to
judge
what
is
intended
by.
and
that
provides
at
any
--
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
pardon,
sir.
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
yes.
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
well,
even
if
that
were
so,
the
--
my
judgment
as
to
what
was
irrelevant
had
to
do
with
the
particular
questions
which
were
asked
at
that
time.
but
in
considering
the
section
of
the
statute
itself,
i
think,
if
your
honor
please,
that
--
if
i
wanted
to
know
other
failing,
i
think,
than
this,
and
such
other
information
whether
or
not
related
to
the
foregoing
as
the
attorney
general
may
deem
fit
and
proper,
i
think
that
if
nothing
else
should
cause
that
particular
section
to
be
struck.
i
equate
this
particular
section
with
such
matters
as
refusal
to
answer
questions
before
a
congressional
committee.
that's
a
similar
situation.
i
also
find
similarity
between
this
kind
of
a
situation
and
one
in
where
--
in
which
a
person
is
called
to
testify
before
a
grand
jury
or
before
our
court
and
refuses
to
do
so.
but
in
those
other
cases,
if
your
honors
please,
there
are
protective
devices
placed
about
the
individual
so
that
he
doesn't
stand
alone
in
a
vacuum
and
no
matter
what
he
does
may
result
in
his
imprisonment.
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
that's
correct.
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
well,
now
i
--
i'll
try
to
limit
myself
for
the
present
to
that
situation.
this
matter
came
before
judge
sullivan
on
two
occasions
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
because
it
didn't
allege
a
crime.
we
took
the
position
that
mere
failure
to
talk
was
not
a
crime
unless
something
else
attended
it.
in
his
first
opinion,
he
--
we
also
argued
that
the
law
was
unconstitutional.
in
his
first
opinion,
he
said
that
he
felt
that
the
law
was
constitutional
but
that
the
questions
which
were
asked
had
to
be
determined
on
the
question
of
relevancy.
and
that
was
all
that
was
in
the
opinion.
that
apparently
was
a
considerable
disappointment
to
the
government
because
they
came
in
with
the
petitioner
asking
the
court
to
clarify
his
opinion.
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
if
nothing
more
had
been
done?
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
my
course
would
have
been
precisely
the
same
thing
that
i
did.
i
would
have
gone
in,
in
response
to
his
opinion
and
asked
the
court
to
determine
from
the
indictment,
which
of
these
questions
were
relevant
as
the
court
put
it.
and
i
did
that,
your
honor.
and
i
would
have
done
it
whether
the
government
had
asked
for
a
clarification.
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
i
can
only
give
my
personal
opinion.
i
think
he
felt
that
a
trial
would
have
ensued.
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
well,
that's
the
government's
fault.
i
--
i
don't
care
if
that
--
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
that's
right
and
that's
why
i
say
that
the
government
was
rather
disturbed
about
it.
now,
under
rule
12
where
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
a
court
has
a
right
to
determine
if
it's
possible
or
whether
or
not
there
is
something
to
be
done
prior
to
the
trial.
on
the
second
argument
before
judge
sullivan,
we
went
into
the
specific
questions
which
were
asked
and
judge
sullivan,
as
your
honors
will
note
from
his
opinion,
could
not
say
that
any
of
the
questions,
about
which
the
indictment
was
brought
in,
were
relevant
to
the
defendant's
availability
for
deportation.
and
on
the
basis
of
that,
he
dismissed
the
indictment.
i
--
i
think
the
federal
court
was
correct
in
that
opinion
because
he
saw
all
of
the
questions
which
were
asked
and
he
doubtless
must
have
compared
these
specific
questions
which
we
refused
to
answer
to
those
which
we
had
answered
and
he
must
have
known
from
those
which
we
answered
that
the
attorney
general
had
all
possible
available
information
as
to
where
this
man
lived
and
what
he
did
so
that
he
could
be
seized
at
anytime
that
deportation
was
possible.
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
the
indictment
was
dismissed
and
we're
from
the
government,
of
course,
appealed
and
i,
representing
the
defendant,
felt
that
since
the
government
had
brought
an
appeal
that
this
did
present
an
opportunity
to
the
defendant
to
present
other
issues
before
this
court,
which
i
hope
the
court
will
consider,
although,
i'm
fully
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
court
will
not
consider
constitutional
issues
if
there
are
other
issues
which
are
available
for
the
adjudication
of
a
case.
personally,
i
regret
it
but
i'm
on
--
on
the
court.
now,
if
the
court
please
--
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
[laughter]
at
least
you're
right.
the
final
words
of
judge
sullivan
were
these.
under
the
statutory,
the
questions
must
be
relevant
to
the
congressional
power
to
legislate.
as
in
the
instant
case,
they
must
relate
to
the
valid
power
of
the
attorney
general,
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
--
wait
a
minute,
i'm
sorry,
i'm
reading
the
wrong
one.
well,
at
any
rate,
i
recounted
without
using
the
language
of
the
court
that
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
was
granted
and
as
a
result
thereof,
we
are
here.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
i
--
i
think
one
of
the
very
important
and
difficult
questions
to
determine
here
is
the
validity
constitutionally
of
the
section
itself.
you
have
a
man
who
cannot
be
deported
because
no
country
will
take
him.
with
reference
to
the
carlson
case
which
was
referred
to
earlier,
that
case
is
the
size
of
--
of
a
situation
during
the
first
six
months
subsequent
to
an
order
of
deportation.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
court
held
that
the
court
have
a
right
to
review
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general
in
refusing
bill.
after
the
six-month
period
is
over,
the
deportee
may
not
be
held
under
bail
but
he
has
to
be
discharged
and
the
practice
is,
in
all
of
these
cases,
that
his
bail
has
returned
to
him
and
he
goes
home
but
he's
called
in
to
sign
if
he
will
and
most
of
the
time,
he
won't,
a
supervisory
parole
agreement
under
which
these
various
things
are
set
up.
and
the
law
provides
that
he
has
to
submit
to
physical
and
psychiatric
examination
at
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general
that
he
may
not
associate
with
persons
who
are
communist
and
originally
the
supervisory
agreement
even
included
a
wife
but
they
have
made
an
exception
since
that,
if
the
court
please.
then,
he
shall
give
information
under
oath
as
to
his
nationality,
circumstances
have
it,
associations
and
activities
and
such
other
information
whether
or
not
related
to
the
foregoing
as
the
attorney
general
may
deem
fit
and
proper
and
to
conform
to
such
reasonable
different
restrictions
on
his
convict
or
activities
as
are
prescribed
by
the
attorney
general
in
his
case.
and
here
is
the
crux
of
it.
any
alien
who
shall
willfully
fail
to
comply
with
such
regulations,
or
willfully
failed
to
appear
or
to
give
information
or
submit
to
medical
or
psychiatric
examination
if
required,
or
knowingly
give
false
information
in
relation
to
the
requirements
of
such
regulations,
or
knowingly
violate
a
reasonable
restriction
imposed
upon
his
convict
or
activity
shall
account
conviction
be
guilty
of
the
felony.
that
has
since
been
changed
to
misdemeanor
and
shall
be
fined
not
more
than
$1000
or
shall
be
imprisoned
not
more
than
one
year
or
both.
to
me,
it
seems
that
the
terminal
points
of
what
a
person
may
or
may
not
do
are
all
together
undetermined
in
this
section
of
the
statute.
i
have
to
--
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
the
supervisory
agreement,
your
honor,
is
subsequent
to
the
six-month
period
and
is
given
to
the
deportee
when
his
bail
is
returned
to
him.
and
he
asked
us
to
sign
that
he
will
refrain
from
doing
certain
things
that
he
will
not
commit
any
offense
under
the
smith
act.
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
yes.
we
take
the
position,
if
your
honor
please,
that
the
statute
does
not
provide,
that
it
has
to
be
signed
by
the
deportee
and
therefore,
the
deportee
does
not
sign
it.
and
it
is
read
to
him.
a
copy
is
handed
to
him
so
in
that
way
he
has
notice
of
it,
but
he
--
he
does
not
agree
to
it
by
signing
it
as
the
questions
do.
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
i
don't
want
to
be
held
to
this,
your
honor,
but
i
think
the
only
condition
on
his
release
on
bail
is
that
he
shall
present
himself
for
deportation
when
called
for.
now,
there
may
be
other
situations
where
they
incorporate
other
conditions.
i
--
i
cannot
say
it.
the
one
i
have
in
mind,
the
one
that
i
recall
seeing
just
requires
him
to
be
there
when
he's
called
for
deportation.
now,
under
the
supervisory
agreement,
your
honors,
we
always
respond,
we
always
come
in.
the
immigration
officer
says,
"be
at
this
office
at
10
o'clock”,
and
next
wednesday,
we're
there.
we
don't
refuse
to
come
in.
we
don't
refuse
to
do
a
solitary
thing
that
they
want
us
to
do,
although,
we
feel
we
have
a
right
to.
but
when
we're
questioned,
we
feel
we
have
a
right
not
to
answer
certain
questions.
now,
we
come
in
because
maybe
the
attorney
general
has
a
passport.
well,
if
he
has,
we've
got
to
submit
to
him.
and
we're
told
to
report
once
a
month
while
we're
on
parole.
we
report
once
a
month.
we
do
absolutely
nothing
--
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
they
used
the
word
parole,
your
honor.
they
call
it
supervisory
parole.
now,
i
--
i
know
parole
relates
to
a
former
imprisonment
and
one
is
released
on
parole
but
the
attorney
general
called
it
supervisory
parole.
it's
incorrect.
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
they
may
question
everytime
we
come
in
but
they
ordinarily
set
aside
two
occasions
during
a
period
of
a
year.
every
six
months
if
you're
called
in,
you're
asked
similar
questions
all
over
again.
and
then
most
of
the
time,
we
answer
most
of
the
questions
if
we
believe
that
they
are
pertinent
to
the
issue,
if
they
believe
--
if
we
believe
that
the
purpose
of
the
question
is
to
know
where
the
party
can
be
found,
et
cetera,
when
they
are
to
be
deported.
now,
another
provision
in
this
so-called
supervisory
parole
agreement
is
that
the
person
shall
not
travel
beyond
50
miles
from
chicago.
it's
an
absurd
limitation
in
our
opinion
but
we
just
don't
do
it
without
getting
permission
as
a
matter
of
fact.
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
they
are
pretty
well
standardized
within
a
particular
district.
now
i
--
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
yes,
yes,
i
can
say
that
they're
practically
the
same
for
everyone.
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
i've
never
had
a
situation
where
they
asked
him
what
his
religion
was
but
they
have
asked,
"do
you
go
to
church?
"or
words
to
that
effect
just
like
here,
"do
you
go
to
movies
at
a
particular
place?
"and
always,
“what
you
do
with
your
spare
time?
how
you
knew
yourself
or
whom
you
meet?
where
you
go?
and
“what
you
read
very
frequently?”
now
all
of
those
matters,
we
say,
are
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
nobody
has
the
right
to
inquire
and
that's
why
we
don't
feel
that
we
should
answer.
now,
when
the
attorney
general
is
given
the
right
to
say
to
us
that
we
maybe
indicted
and
maybe
penalized
with
the
year
out
of
our
lives
in
$1000
for
a
refusal
to
give
information
as
to
nationality,
circumstances,
habits,
associations
and
activities
and
such
other
information
whether
or
not
related
to
the
foregoing
as
the
attorney
general
may
deem
fit
and
proper.
what
is
the
test
to
which
we're
entitled
in
order
to
determine
in
advance
whether
or
not
we
are
subject
to
$1000
penalty?
there's
no
test
of
any
kind
here.
it's
a
situation
where
the
section
of
the
statute
determines
it
and
not
the
indictment
itself.
and
if
the
statute
or
the
section
of
the
statute
is
so
vague
as
not
to
give
proper
notice,
then
the
statute
and
everything
else
in
relation
to
it
must
fall.
there
just
isn't
any
question
about
it,
the
lanzetta
case
which
this
court
decided,
the
cardiff
case
which
this
court
decided
fairly
recently
a
number
of
other
cases
together.
that
of
course,
is
so
elementary
that
i
don't
want
to
take
the
court's
time
about
it.
but
how
are
we
to
determine
anything?
now,
i
should
say
through
your
honors
too
that
in
st.
louis,
the
zedner
case
is
gradually
coming
up
this
way.
the
zedner
case
was
a
civil
proceeding
in
which
it
was
attempted
to
enjoin
the
attorney
general
from
restricting
people
as
to
their
movements
from
requiring
them
to
report
at
certain
times,
et
cetera.
and
the
court,
it
was
a
three-judge
court,
ruled
as
to
several
of
these
restrictions
that
they
were
improper.
and
the
government
has
appealed
from
that
and
mrs.
zedner
herself
has
also
entered
a
cross-appeal
in
relation
to
it.
but
in
that
situation,
there
isn't
so
very
much
danger.
why?
because
it's
just
a
civil
proceeding
and
it
may
be
determined
favorably
to
the
petitioner
or
may
not
but
at
least
there's
no
question
about
the
person's
liberty
being
lost
to
him.
here,
we
have
a
working
man
who
earns
$72
or
$82
a
week
with
a
family
of
five,
who
has
to
put
up
a
$4000
bond
on
this
indictment,
who
had
to
engage
counsel
to
represent
him
and
counsels
here
and
it
has
been
placed
through
all
of
these
expense
and
great
insecurity
and
great
inconvenience
because
of
a
statute
which,
on
its
face
to
me
at
least,
is
strangely
vague
and
strangely
lacking
insufficient
notice
to
the
defendant
for
him
to
know
what
is
required
of
him.
it's
a
new
crime
which
congress
tried
to
create.
nothing
like
this
has
ever
been
before
this
court
before
because
the
law
was
only
enacted
in
1950,
i
believe,
and
it's
a
case
of
first
impression,
i
--
i
make
them
as
far
as
this
court
is
concerned.
now,
i
have
briefly
covered
what
i
feel
is
relevant
under
the
first
amendment.
what
we
read,
whom
we
see,
where
we
go,
what
we
talk
about
are
things
which
may
not
be
revealed
under
circumstances
such
as
this.
take
a
situation
where
a
person
is
asked
or
is
requested
to
testify
either
before
a
grand
jury
or
before
a
court
and
refuses
for
some
reasons.
he
may
be
held
in
contempt,
but
most
of
the
time,
he
is
given
an
opportunity
to
purge
himself
of
that
contempt
by
saying
that
he
will
testify
and
by
so
testifying.
in
this
situation,
we
have
nothing,
no
opening
left
to
the
defendant
at
all.
he
says
he
will
not
testify.
there
is
no
possibility
of
review.
there's
nobody
in
the
immigration
service
who
has
a
right
to
review
this
situation,
merely
because
some
subordinate,
sometimes
unjustified,
i
believe,
in
calling
him
an
under
length.
some
person
asks
some
questions
which
cannot,
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination,
be
regarded
as
pertinent.
we
are
immediately
subject
to
indictment.
that
of
itself,
i
think,
ought
to
be
a
sufficient
consideration
for
a
court
in
relation
to
the
right
of
the
attorney
general
to
require
a
person
to
testify
under
those
circumstances.
i've
already
shown
in
relation
to
other
situations.
may
i
call
the
attention
to
the
fact
of
testifying
before
congressional
committee?
there
you
have
the
protection
by
the
law
itself
which
says
we
are
required
to
testify
to
those
things
which
are
pertinent
to
the
matter
which
the
committee
is
investigating.
here,
there
is
nothing
at
all,
not
only
is
they
have
nothing
to
say
it's
pertinent,
but
the
breadth
given
to
the
attorney
general
is
absolutely
without
any
scope
at
all.
he
can
go
as
far
as
he
likes
and
the
only
way
you
can
test
it
is
to
have
yourself
indicted.
one
of
the
questions
which
i
think
is
of
serious
import
here
is
the
manner
of
the
procedure
or
the
method
--
matter
of
procedure.
the
question
was
raised
somewhat
in
the
case
of
the
united
states
versus
spector.
there
--
there
was
involved,
if
the
court
please,
the
question
of
proceeding
on
an
indictment
without
proof
of
the
tax
leading
up
to
the
situation
except
that
of
an
administrative
order
of
the
immigration
service.
in
that
particular
case,
it
was
said
that
if
that
question
had
been
raised,
it
might
have
been
considered
but
it
wasn't
raised
there.
and
therefore,
we
are
asking
to
have
a
right
to
raise
it
here
and
that
does
constitute
a
constitutional
issue
or
one
of
the
constitutional
issues,
what
have
we
here.
on
--
an
order
of
deportation
entered
by
an
administrative
agency
without
really
the
protections
of
the
administrative
procedures
act,
even
though
there
is
a
review
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
an
order
of
deportation
so
entered
becomes
the
basis
for
a
criminal
proceeding.
it's
contrary
in
my
opinion
to
the
constitutional
guarantee
to
have
a
right
to
face
your
witnesses.
you
have
a
right
to
cross-examine
your
witnesses.
you
have
a
right
to
subpoena
them.
under
this
proposal,
a
mere
order
of
an
administrative
agency
without
more
forms
the
basis
of
a
criminal
proceeding.
now,
i'm
aware
of
the
yakus
case
and
i'm
aware
of
the
cox
case
and
some
of
the
other
selective
servicemen's
cases
which
say
that
i'm
an
order
of
a
draft
court,
a
criminal
indictment
can
be
brought
here,
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
introduce
the
order
of
the
draft
court
to
justify
such
a
proceeding.
but,
your
honors,
there's
a
great
distinction
again
because
take,
for
instance,
the
yakus
case,
that
had
to
do
with
rates
during
the
war
emergency.
it
was
a
strong
opinion
written
by
the
majority
with
a
strong
dissent
as
well.
but
in
that
particular
situation,
the
defendants,
are
those
who
were
indicted,
did
not
avail
themselves
of
the
right
of
review
under
the
emergency
court
of
appeals
and
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
before
the
fact
that
the
court
held
that
under
such
a
situation
an
indictment
could
be
proceeded
upon.
now,
the
selective
service
cases
are
so
totally
different
from
this
sort
of
a
situation
because
there,
every
possible
protective
device
by
way
of
review
is
thrown
about
a
candidate
for
the
draft,
so
that
he
has
an
opportunity
at
various
stages
of
the
proceedings
to
show
why
he
should
not
be
drafted
if
he
wants
to
or
to
have
his
situation
reviewed
so
that
he
doesn't
come
into
a
court
in
this
kind
of
a
situation
totally
liking
of
and
totally
naked
as
to
any
protection
to
which
he
might
be
entitled
to.
a
person
is
indicted
for
robbery,
for
any
crime
at
all
and
everybody
who
is
a
witness
or
who
can
be
a
witness
must
come
in
to
testify.
in
this
sort
of
a
proceeding,
all
of
the
facts
leading
up
to
the
order
of
deportation
of
which
are
gathered
together
in
really
a
quite
informal
way
are
reduced
to
an
order
and
that
order
that
mere
slip
of
paper
constitutes
the
witnesses
to
the
right
of
the
government
to
deport.
and
on
the
basis
of
that
mere
slip
of
paper,
the
government
may
proceed
on
this
kind
of
indictment.
i
think
that's
definitely
contrary
to
any
kind
of
anglo-saxon
criminal
jurisprudence
because
it
definitely
deprives
a
person
of
the
right
to
face
his
accusers.
and
there's
nothing
we
can
do
about
it.
that
matter
has
not
been
disposed
of
by
this
honorable
court
and
i
sincerely
hope
that
it
might
have
consideration
because
it
--
it's
permissible
in
this
kind
of
a
situation.
other
situations
will
develop
where
it
will
also
be
permissible.
and
on
that
way
by
gradual
process,
those
rights
which
we
consider
as
belonging
to
us
under
the
constitutional
authority
are
gradually
be
eliminated.
i
have
touched
briefly
on
the
right
of
an
individual
not
to
have
his
right
of
locomotion
interfered
with
as
it
is
in
this
kind
of
a
situation
under
this
kind
of
a
parole
agreement.
and
i
think
freedom
to
which
a
person
is
entitled
to
and
an
alien
has
the
same
rights
under
the
constitution
as
a
native
and
that
too
is
elementary
and
i
shouldn't
take
time
to
say
it
under
that
kind
of
a
situation,
an
alien
who
is
resident
here
now
merely
because
the
attorney
general
can't
find
the
place
to
send
him.
he
should
not
be
restricted
in
any
way
at
all
in
his
convict
except
to
report
for
deportation
when
it
is
necessary
or
when
it
becomes
possible
to
deport
him.
to
do
anything
else
is
to
punish
him
for
being
an
alien
because
we
don't
punish
other
people
who
are
not
aliens
in
relation
to
this
kind
of
a
situation.
and
there's
authority,
i
think,
for
the
position
i
take
and
the
authority
that's
cited
in
the
brief.
another
matter
which
occurs
to
me
in
connection
with
that
situation
is
whether
or
not
the
attorney
general
has
a
right
to
any
of
this
at
all
under
the
tenth
amendment
because
out
of
the
tenth
amendment,
a
department
of
the
government
or
an
official
of
the
government
only
has
those
rights
which
are
proper
and
necessary
to
carry
out
whatever
other
rights
he
has.
now,
what
right
has
the
attorney
general
here
other
than
to
deport
this
individual?
he
has
none
at
all.
supervision,
if
you
call
it
that,
only
consists,
in
my
humble
opinion,
of
knowing
where
he
is,
so
he
may
be
deported.
but
on
the
question
of
supervision
and
making
him
behave
in
doing
the
right
things
after
his
ordered
deported,
you
have
the
laws
of
48
countries,
the
48
states
which
determined
what
his
conduct
should
be.
you
have
the
laws
of
the
federal
government
which
determine
what
his
conduct
should
be.
it's
not
a
crime
to
go
to
a
meeting,
unless
it'd
be
a
conspiratorial
meeting.
it's
not
a
time
to
read
or
to
do
any
of
the
other
things
mentioned
here
or
to
go
through
moving
pictures.
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
the
--
it
is
not
part
of
the
record
essentially
but
he
was
ordered
deported
because
at
one
time
and
not
presently,
it
was
said
at
a
hearing,
where
he
was
not
represented
by
a
counsel,
that
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
it
was
not
a
crime
at
that
time.
i
don't
know
if
it's
a
crime
now,
your
honor.
now
--
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
yes.
the
carlson
case
is
distinguished
by
me
in
only
this
way
that
the
burden
of
that
case
is
what
rights
the
attorney
general
has
in
relation
to
a
deportee
or
prospective
deportee
for
a
period
of
six
months
subsequent
to
the
order
of
deportation
and
not
beyond
that.
now,
the
carlson
case
arose
because
a
person
was
denied
bail
by
the
court
and
by
the
attorney
general
during
that
six-month
period.
the
case
holds
that
the
attorney
general
has
not
an
untrammeled
right
to
hold
without
that
that
his
discretion
is
subject
to
review.
and
that
particular
feature
of
the
carlson
case
is
also
reviewed
by
mr.
justice
clark
in
the
mezei
case
where
he
says
that
when
they
hold
that
the
attorney
general
may
hold
for
a
short
period
of
time
for
the
purpose
of
affecting
deportation
but
it
doesn't
go
any
further
than
that.
now,
the
law
at
the
present
time
is
this
that
if
he
cannot
affect
deportation
within
six
months,
he's
got
to
release
the
deportee.
and
he
has
to
return
his
bail
to
him.
now,
is
the
man
a
better
man
after
six
months?
is
he
a
worst
man
after
six
months?
it's
simply
the
question
of
what
is
--
of
what
the
law
provides
and
what
is
reasonable
under
the
law.
the
carlson
case,
i
say,
relates
only
to
the
first
six
months
subsequent
to
the
order
of
deportation.
and
thereafter,
it
has
no
bearing
except
that
it
says
the
attorney
general
has
certain
rights
which
are
reviewable.
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
i
think,
if
your
honor
please,
that
that
is
the
proximity
of
the
language
of
the
court
in
that
particular
case.
but
i
think
you
have
to
view
it
as
limited
by
the
six-month
period.
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
i
would
say
he
does
not
have
it
after
the
six
months
because
he
cannot
hold
without
bail
after
the
six
months.
and
to
--
pardon?
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
i
would
say
that
he
can
only
do
those
things
which
are
necessary
and
proper
under
the
law
to
carry
out
his
right.
and
what
is
his
right,
just
to
deport
and
nothing
else.
and
he
has
no
right
to
supervise
his
conduct.
he
has
no
right
to
say
where
he
--
what
meetings
he
may
attend,
whether
he
may
make
public
speeches,
whether
he
may
do
anything
else
at
all
which
is
a
lawful
effort
on
his
part,
any
more
than
the
attorney
general
can
tell
anybody
else,
a
citizen,
a
national
of
whether
he
may
do
those
things.
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
if
that
is
the
position
i
take,
if
the
court
please.
and
i
think
it's
a
reasonable
position
because
he
has
been
denied
the
right
to
physically
supervise
him
after
the
six-month
period.
certainly,
if
you're
going
to
talk
about
supervision
holding
in
custody
is
perhaps
the
most
secured
kind
of
security,
the
most
secured
kind
of
supervision.
but
he
is
denied
that
right
after
that.
now,
what
right
has
he
after
the
six
months?
it
has
been
taken
away
from
him
the
right
to
hold
in
prison.
but
you
have
not
taken
away
from
him
the
right
to
deport.
that
is
the
only
right,
that's
the
naked
right,
that
is
left
and
he
has
a
right
to
know
where
the
person
can
be
found.
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
i
could
say
in
answer
to
that
that
the
government's
interest
might
be
the
same
but
the
government's
interest
may
not
be
so
expressed
or
they
may
not
be
able
to
exercise.
in
other
words,
i
mean
that
this,
if
the
court
please,
the
mere
fact
that
congress
has
said
that
we're
worried
about
the
situation
and
that
we're
going
to
do
something
about
it
doesn't
give
congress
the
right
to
do
it.
they
may
only
legislate
in
relation
to
those
things
about
which
they
have
been
given
a
right.
now,
if
they
haven't
been
given
the
right
to
legislate
here
as
they
seem
to
indicate,
the
mere
intention
that
they
had
or
the
mere
desire
that
they
had
to
do
certain
things
is
not
justified
by
the
law
no
matter
how
much
they
write
it,
no
matter
how
much
they
declare
it
in
the
law.
that
doesn't
give
them
the
right
to
do
it.
that's
why
i
say,
they
only
have
a
right
to
do
that
which
is
necessarily
improper
to
carry
out
the
right
to
deport.
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
if
the
court
please,
i
regretfully
say
i
do
not
accept
carlson.
i
accepted
as
a
lawyer
because
that's
the
law
today.
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
that
maybe
--
nevertheless,
if
the
court
please,
this
court
has
acted
according
through
its
lights
and
we'll
continue
to
do
so.
and
since
carlson,
i'd
say,
only
relates
to
the
first
six-month
period
and
since
i
also
say
that
the
other
things
that
the
attorney
general
endeavoring
to
do,
he
is
not
authorized
to
do,
i
personally,
if
you
don't
know
inconsistency
there.for
instance,
another
thing
that
the
carlson
case
said
was
that
they
had
a
right
to
hold
without
bail.
now,
it's
my
personal
notion
that
under
our
kind
of
law,
you
had
no
right
to
hold
without
bail
except
under
certain
specific
situations,
but
the
court
disagrees
with
me
and
i
accept
it
as
an
officer
of
the
court.
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
if
the
court
please,
the
carlson
case
says
that
they
may
hold
that
the
attorney
general
may
hold
without
bail
--
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
--
for
six
months.
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
our
proposition
that
--
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
when
i
say
--
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
on
the
carlson.
what
i
say,
mr.
justice
black,
is
that
i
personally
cannot
accept
carlson
as
being
correct.
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
no,
it
does
not.
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
certainly
not.
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
it
--
it
should
not
be
applicable
to
this
kind
of
a
situation.
that's
where
i
draw
attention
to
the
fact
that
it's
only
applicable
during
the
six-month
period
and
not
beyond
that.
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
no,
that
is
--
what
i'm
saying
is
in
relation
to
the
carlson
case
itself.
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
that's
right.
i
think
in
effect
that's
what
judge
sullivan
said.
and
therefore,
he
says,
"if
questions
are
to
be
asked,
they
have
to
relate
to
the
man's
availability
for
deportation.”
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
i
acted
not
precisely
on
that.
i
acted
on
this
but
i
knew
that
i
could
take
the
fifth
as
far
as
he
was
concerned.
i
didn't
feel
that
--
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
that's
right.
that's
how
they
talk
about
it,
your
honor.
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
all
right.
i
could
have
advised
him
to
plead
the
fifth
amendment.
personally,
i
doubt
if
he
would
have
taken
my
advice
because
as
a
man
of
integrity,
he
felt
that
he
have
to
answer
some
questions.
he
was
not
required
to
answer
other
questions
and
he
didn't
want
to
indulge
in
any
subterfuge
at
all.
and
therefore,
we
drew
the
line
as
to
that
which
is
pertinent.
i've
always
called
it
pertinency,
judge
sullivan
has
called
it
relevancy
--
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
--
and
i
don't
think
they
are
much
the
same
thing
and
that's
right.
and
i've
also
taken
the
further
proposition
that
there
are
certain
issues
which
the
attorney
general
had
no
right
to
go
into
and
therefore,
they
were
not
pertinent
to
it.
now,
if
your
honors,
i
think
i
have
practically
exhausted
my
time
and
i
could
use
more
but
i
--
i
don't
want
to
tire
the
court.
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
situations
where
a
court
can
constructively
and
properly
take
the
view
that
a
government
or
rather
a
legislature
does
go
beyond
the
powers
which
it
has
and
it
seems
to
me
very
--
when
i
ran
across
thomas
jefferson's
letter
to
james
madison
in
which
he
refers
to
the
tyranny
of
legislatures
as
being
the
formidable
dread
at
present
and
it
will
be
for
many
years.
i
found
it
just
about
at
the
time
i
was
writing
this
brief
and
i
think
it
is
--
ms.
pearl
m.
hart
well,
i
don't
know
but
i
feel
this
that
certainly
judge
sullivan's
opinion,
i
think,
there
is
great
justification
in
accepting
in
the
situation.
i
think
there's
logic
there
and
i
think
there
is
reason
and
i
think
there
is
everything
else
which
requires
an
affirmation
there.
some
of
us
who
are
so
greatly
interested
in
matters
of
the
constitutional
law
would
be
very
grateful
if
the
court
found
it
possible
to
consider
other
phases
which
i
have
called
your
attention.
thank
you
so
much.
