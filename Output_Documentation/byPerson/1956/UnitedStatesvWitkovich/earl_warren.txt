mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
don't
these
cases
often
lie
in
the
files
of
the
immigration
bureau
without
action
on
them
for
a
long,
long
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
without
an
appeal
being
taken
or
anything
of
that
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
reason
i
ask
you
this,
sir,
in
the
state
service,
we
used
to
get
communications
from
the
bureau
of
immigration
saying
that
so
and
so
was
ordered
deported
on
a
certain
day.
it
may
have
been
a
couple
of
years
before.
and
it
appears
that
he's
been
convicted
of
a
crime
in
your
state.
if
he
is
relieved,
if
the
governor
will
grant
a
pardon
or
he's
relieved
of
it
in
any
way,
it
will
not
be
necessary
to
deport
him.
and
sometimes
we
get
letters
over
--
over
a
long
period
of
time
and
it
--
it
wouldn't
hardly
consist
that
we've
an
appeal
from
the
--
from
the
order
of
deportation
and
they
just
appear
to
me
that
there
are
lot
of
those
cases
that
--
that
just
were
in
limbo
and
--
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
sir.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
davis,
under
the
law,
does
the
court
have
the
right
in
--
in
admitting
a
man
to
bail
to
subjecting
to
--
to
all
these
conditions
that
--
that
attorney
general
subjects
into
after
the
six
months?
would
it
be
--
would
it
be
a
valid
release
on
bail
if
they
put
those
restrictions
on
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
take
this
one.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
this
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
do
think
it
is?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
--
that's
what
i
think.
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
the
matter
of
the
words,
it's
your
position
that
the
court
did
say
in
the
first
instance
when
he's
ordered
deported,
i'll
admit
you
to
bail
with
the
sum
of
$5000
provided
you
--
you
submit
yourself
to
the
attorney
general
and
answer
all
questions
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
do
all
things
that
--
that
the
statute
requires
that
you
can
--
you
must
do
after
the
six
months
period.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
well,
can
he
--
can
the
attorney
general
provide
such
a
bond?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
does
--
does
the
attorney
general
issue
bond
releases
of
that
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
could.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
as
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
inquiry
of
the
attorney
general
should
be
limited
to
the
reasons
for
the
man's
deportation
that
is
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
must
be
in
that
field?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
take
two
--
two
situations.
one
man
is
deported
because
of
--
of
his
association
with
the
communist
party.
chief
justice
earl
warren
another
man
is
deported
because
he
--
he
has
a
conviction
of
narcotics.
now,
would
you
say
that
the
--
the
man
who
was
convicted
of
narcotics
and
who
was
deported
for
that
conduct
could
not
be
under
surveillance
of
the
attorney
general
for
subversive
activities
while
he
is
awaiting
it
or
--
or
--
and
that
the
attorney
general
would
be
limited
to
surveilling
his
conduct
in
relation
to
the
narcotic
traffic.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
the
--
the
narcotic
violator
could
become
subversive
and
the
--
and
the
subversive
could
become
a
narcotic.
chief
justice
earl
warren
therefore,
without
--
without
interfering
with
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
--
let's
say
that
the
narcotics
violator
had
no
background
of
--
of
communism
at
all.
but
when
he
was
under
the
surveillance
of
the
attorney
general
in
this
deportation
proceeding,
it
was
ascertained
that
he
read
the
daily
worker,
that
he
went
to
this
--
this
place
that
--
to
meetings.
he
associated
with
some
known
communist
and
was
--
was
suspected
of
--
of
being
a
communist
at
that
time.
will
the
attorney
general
then
have
the
right
to
say,
“now,
i'm
going
to
--
i'm
going
to
keep
you
under
surveillance
as
to
your
communistic
activities
and
i'm
going
to
require
you
to
report
to
me
on
all
your
associations
in
that
field.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
--
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that's
your
position.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
then
the
words
that
justice
black
read
from
the
--
from
the
act
do
become
very
forceful,
don't
they?
and
in
that
anything
that
the
attorney
general
desires
to
inquire
probably
he
has
a
right
to
do.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he
might
even
--
he
might
even
have
been
guilty
of
conduct
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
it
would
---
it
would
be
of
a
suspicious
character
that
--
that
under
those
circumstances,
the
--
the
attorney
general
would
not
be
limited
to
any
field.
he
could
--
he
could
--
keeping
him
under
surveillance
for
his
entire
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
ms.
hart.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
there
any
such
conditions
in
his
release
on
bail
during
that
six
months
period,
ms.
hart?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
