unknown
speaker
--
i
would
like
to
reserve
it
for
rebuttal.
unknown
speaker
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
court
please.
one
matter
of
clarification,
ms.
hart
spoke
of
a
--
unknown
speaker
--
supervision
agreement.
i
think
what
she
has
in
mind
is
that
at
the
time
a
supervisory
order
is
issued,
it
is
presented
to
the
alien
for
him
to
acknowledge
that
he
has
read
and
understood
it
and
that
he
understands
what
failure
to
comply
with
the
terms
of
the
order
will
--
will
result
here.
as
a
matter
of
fact
on
page
31
of
the
record
at
the
end
of
this
supervisory
order,
there
is
the
place
for
the
signature
of
the
alien
to
show
that
he
has
received
and
served
with
the
copy
of
this
supervisory
order.
in
this
case,
the
alien
refused
to
sign
it
and
so
there
was
a
note
that
it
was
read
to
him
instead
of
his
having
agreed
that
he
had
read
it.
unknown
speaker
why
they
dropped
it
out
of
the
indictment?
unknown
speaker
i
think
that
--
unknown
speaker
--
it
may
well
confront
that
it
wasn't
immaterial
to
the
--
that
the
question
wasn't
immaterial.
i
don't
know.
unknown
speaker
pardon?
unknown
speaker
it
may
have
been
so.
unknown
speaker
i
--
i
have
no
information
why
they
dropped
it.
i
--
i'm
glad
they
did
drop
it.
i
--
i
wouldn't
like
it.
unknown
speaker
i
think
the
basic
question
on
constitutionality
on
this
question
is
whether
or
not
this
type
of
supervision
is
considered
by
the
court
to
be
a
reasonable
--
a
reasonable
device
to
meet
the
situation
which
existed.
there's
no
question
that
there
was
a
trouble
in
situation
with
4000
aliens
who
had
been
--
who
would
had
been
ordered
deported
and
couldn't
be
deported
and
we're
under
no
restrictions
or
whatsoever
as
to
that
conduct.
unknown
speaker
oh,
no,
that
was
the
total
at
the
time
of
the
enactment.
it's
about
the
same
day
though.
this
figure
of
aliens
who
are
subject
to
supervision
today
is
4356.
unknown
speaker
that
was,
of
all
--
the
supervisory
orders
cannot
be
issued.
that's
right.
that's
--
this
isn't
under
any
bond.
this
is
under
the
--
unknown
speaker
--
six-month
rule.
unknown
speaker
they
haven't
been
--
for
one
reason
or
another,
they
had
not
been
able
to
deport
them.
unknown
speaker
i
think
that
is
right.
unknown
speaker
that
is
right.
unknown
speaker
there
are
many
--
there
are
many
problems
out
in
this
case.
it's
find
from
certain
that
we
would
kind
of
to
find
that
the
--
the
immigration
service
can't
find
a
place
to
deport
him
to
because
they're
just
delays.
they
get
--
no,
he
has
indicated,
the
first
place
is
the
place
that
the
alien
indicates
and
he
has
indicated
yugoslavia.
and
all
that
has
happened
is
on
the
record
because
they
can't
get
any
answer
from
yugoslavia
whether
they
have
taken
him
or
not.
when
they
get
an
answer,
by
then
the
statute
provides
for
alternative
places
to
deport
him
but
this
is
--
this
is
the
cause
of
the
delay.
unknown
speaker
that
is
right.
he
has,
however,
the
right
to
choose
the
first
place
that
they
deport
an
alien
to
--
unknown
speaker
--
is
the
place
that
he
chooses.
unknown
speaker
no
because
there
are
alternative
places
to
deport
him.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
no
one
takes
him,
why
didn't
he
--
unknown
speaker
that
is
--
that
is
so
if
it
was
impossible
to
deport
him
to
any
place.
unknown
speaker
that
is
very
true
but
the
present
--
and
the
present
immigration
act,
the
--
the
immigration
nationality
act
of
1952
put
steps
to
remedy
to
this
situation
to
give
the
attorney
general
authority
to
broaden
the
countries
that
he
could
--
that
he
could
use
as
a
place
to
--
of
haven
for
this
people
so
that
we
can
hope
that
the
administration
under
the
new
act
will
cut
down
on
--
on
the
(voice
overlap)
--
unknown
speaker
yes.
but
in
--
in
reasonable
time,
i'm
sure
the
government
can
take
that
as
a
denial
and
go
on
to
the
next
--
for
the
next
country.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
not
certain
that
a
deportation
order
would
be
essential
to
asking
questions.
we
all
--
we
have
an
alien
registration
law
which
--
which
then
authorizes
the
service
to
ask
many
questions
of
all
aliens
here
whether
they
are
deported
or
not.
i
--
my
argument,
however,
was
that
the
supervisory
--
the
supervisory
order
on
these
questions
received
content
from
the
fact
that
there
has
been
an
order
of
deportation
and
the
basis
for
that
order.
unknown
speaker
at
the
present
time,
the
alien
registration
law
provides
for
registration
of
all
aliens
in
this
country.
it
provides
the
annual
report
by
all
aliens
in
this
country.
unknown
speaker
following
that
question,
no.
unknown
speaker
no,
except
as
the
annual
report
form
or
whatever
the
annual
report
form
may
be.
unknown
speaker
well,
no
--
unknown
speaker
no,
my
argument
--
unknown
speaker
--
my
argument
was
that
the
deportation
order
gave
reasonable
content
to
the
supervisory
order
that
since
this
is
supplementary
to
the
deportation
that
there
are
some
reasonable
restrictions
on
the
attorney
general
as
to
the
nature
of
this
--
unknown
speaker
and
my
basis
for
saying
that
is
that
in
carlson
against
landon,
then
the
--
the
thought
of
the
--
the
nature
of
the
deportation
proceeding
had
a
relation
to
the
attorney
general's
authority
to
--
to
confine
the
aliens.
unknown
speaker
well,
yes.
unknown
speaker
i
wasn't
suggesting
this
court
to
pass
upon
the
constitutionality
of
the
alien
registration
act.
unknown
speaker
i
--
i
don't
know
the
numbers.
unknown
speaker
the
--
the
special
legislation
with
respect
to
aliens
during
the
war
--
under
the
war
power,
there
are
certain
circumstances
where
different
regulations
seemed
to
be
appropriate.
