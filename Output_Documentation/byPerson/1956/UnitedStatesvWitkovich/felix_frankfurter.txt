justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
davis
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
please
advise
me
--
assume
--
assume
we're
against
you
on
construction.
can
we
--
say
can
we
be
assuming
we
could
under
the
criminality
of
act,
shouldn't
we
reach
constitutionality?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
you
know
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
as
you're
proposing,
i
mean
as
a
matter
of
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
matter
of
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
doubt
that.but
this
is
a
question
that's
been
wrapping
around
my
head.
it's
(inaudible)
whether
--
when
the
court
of
--
the
court
below
sustained
it
and
it
didn't
reach
--
or
rather
sustained
the
statute
on
his
construction
and
we
disagree
with
his
construction.
should
we
go
then
reach
a
question
which
he
on
his
construction
didn't
reach?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
like
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
--
it's
a
question
of
--
hold
there.
in
other
words,
(b)
my
second
question
was,
(a),
could
we,
(b),
should
we,
are
different
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
answer
to
could
we,
is
i
should
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it's
clear,
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
wanted
to
be
sure
that
i
was
correct
in
assuming
that
jurisdiction
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
that
last
statement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
would
seem
you
said
something
he
may
not,
what
may
not?
well,
i
misheard.
justice
felix
frankfurter
after
six
months,
he
must.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
must.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
doubt
about
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
matter
what
the
alien
does.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
i
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
(inaudible)
that's
true
of
people
(inaudible)
but
--
but
that's
i
think
that's
rather
crucial
a
bit
but
not
crucial
but
it's
--
that
the
heart
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
case
from
a
part
of
judge
sullivan's
position,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
case
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
take
it
that
your
--
that
you
were
here
where
you
conceive
the
case
to
be
this.
there's
an
outstanding
deportation
order.
the
validity
of
that
is
not
in
question
now
and
cannot
be
considered
that
the
order
was
not
executed
for
six
months
for
good
and
sufficient
reasons
presumably.
and
then
came
into
operation
the
provision
of
the
statute
that
at
the
end
of
six
months,
he
must
be
allowed
freedom
subject
to
conditions
upon
his
movement.
i'm
not
now
saying
how
limited
they
may
be.
but
the
attorney
general
may
impose
conditions
from
letting
him
in
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(inaudible)
will
that
at
the
end
of
six
months,
it
would
be
your
own
t
to
detain
him.
the
conditions
aren't
here.
the
legality
of
the
specific
conditions
aren't
here
in
question,
are
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
are
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
let
me
--
let
me
go
step
by
step.
suppose
we
first
say
that
assuming
the
conditions
are
relevant
to
the
--
the
act
of
congress
making
the
provision
of
what
you
have
at
the
end
of
six
months,
but
then
the
question
is
not
whether
a
particular
question
but
assuming
questions
that
there
be
such
in
this
roster
of
questions.
assuming
any
question
relevant
to
ascertaining
obedience
or
disobedience
to
the
conditions
imposed
may
the
attorney
general
ask
those
questions
and
failure
to
answer
them
be
followed
by
the
consequence,
isn't
that
the
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
davis,
i
--
i
recognized
you
had
temptations
for
this
constitution
experience,
but
why
didn't
you
first
dispose
of
the
statutory
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
ask
in
order
to
search
--
in
order
to
understand
what
judge
sullivan
ruled.
do
i
understand
that
if
the
questions
were
solely
directed
to
and
relevant
be
limited
to
inquiries,
whether
he
hasn't
changed
his
--
his
habitat
was
such
was
frequently
and
leaving
no
address
behind
at
each
change
of
residence
or
habitations
whether
you
infer
or
have
we
tried
to
infer
judge
sullivan
would
say,
“that's
all
right.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
statute
has
a
purpose,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
deportation
order
is
directed
towards
the
ground
for
deportation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
should
we
imply
that
in
order
to
have
it
declared
unconstitutional?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
we
eventually
get
to
the
statute,
mr.
davis,
that
construction
brought
the
case
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
davis,
i'm
a
little
puzzled
by
your
mode
of
arguments
here.
we
haven't
this
before
us
restraint,
any
restraint,
any
confinement.
we
have
before
us
a
basis
of
--
of
criminal
charge
derived
from
the
claim
of
the
government,
of
the
right
of
the
attorney
general
to
ask
questions.
surely
they
have
subordinate
asking.
the
attorney
general
is
given
enough
power
and
i
at
--
myself
oh,
i
would
restrict
that
to
certain
cases.
so
that
if
the
question
here
is
restraint
the
--
the
narrow
question
as
i
see
it
is
whether
he
--
the
congress
may
authorize
him
to
ask
questions
and
if
he
has
the
right
--
if
congress
may
so
authorize
him
to
ask
question
then
making
disobedience
of
such
a
lawful
order,
for
purposes
of
the
question
an
offense
i
think
that
the
latter
isn't
troublesome
if
the
congress
of
the
united
states
can
give
that
authority
to
the
attorney
general
then
disobedience
of
such
an
authority
may
within
the
restrictions
of
the
--
call
them
unusual
punishment,
these
followed
by
legal
consequences.
so,
i
don't
know
why
you're
talking
about
restraint.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
whole
point
about
that
judge
sullivan's
opinion
is
that
in
as
much
as
he
can't
do
anything
or
congress
hasn't
provided
for
the
doing
anything
in
case
of
disobedience
of
his
restrictions
except
to
make
him
talk,
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
what
--
i
--
i
asked
you
a
little
while
ago.
what
can
he
do
that
--
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
sullivan
says
no
matter
what
happened
he
can't
do
anything
about
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
he
can
do?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
that
isn't
question
here
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
is
violated,
that
all
i'm
saying
is
that
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
proceedings
--
the
proceedings
relating
to
the
inquiry
doesn't
authorize
the
attorney
general
to
do
anything
if
he
disobeys
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
except
that
he
subjects
him
to
criminal
prosecution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
we
haven't
before
us
a
case
of
--
of
allegedly
unlawful
restraint.
we
have
before
us
a
challenge
to
the
authority
to
ask
question,
disobedience
to
which
these
are
made
an
offense
and
therefore
we
are
drawn
back
out
of
the
question
whether
congress
may
impose
such
a
duty
upon
a
deportable
alien.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
all
the
question
is,
isn't
it?
and
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
true.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
have
to
decide
in
this
case
--
in
passing
on
the
construction--
on
passing
on
this,
the
judgment
of
judge
sullivan,
the
question
whether
congress
could
make
disobedience
of
the
conditions
which
the
attorney
general
imposed
at
the
end
of
six
months
an
offense.
is
that
also
in
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
why
do
we
go
all
over
these
to
me,
rather
difficult.
i
hope
they
are
to
others
difficult
constitutional
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
least
until
we
get
through
knowing
what
the
statute
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
unless
judge
sullivan
is
right
as
an
end
of
the
matter,
isn't
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
must
--
certainly,
they
must
--
certainly,
the
questions
must
be
made
relevant
to
what
congress
has
authorized
and
this
court
has
already
sustained
the
power
of
the
attorney
general
to
say
at
the
end
of
six
--
not
the
power
--
the
power
of
congress
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
say
at
the
end
of
six
months,
you're
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we're
going
to
keep
an
eye
on
you
because
we
want
to
deport
if
yugoslavia
opens
up.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
--
i
had
supposed,
i
don't
know.
this
may
be
just
be
a
simple
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
narrowness
of
mind
that
we
ought
to
stick
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
such
narrow
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
not
sustained.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i
understand
that
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
justice
black
assumes
that
we
disagree
with
judge
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
judge
sullivan
and
you've
already
answered
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we've
already
said
that
we
don't
have
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
but
you've
said
where
is
--
i
put
to
you
question.
it's
very
obvious.
assume
we
disagree
with
judge
sullivan,
maybe
(a)
maybe
raise
questions
of
the
constitutionality.
secondly,
should
we?
and
it's
not
for
you
to
say
whether
we
should
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it's
for
us
to
say.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
to
make
a
point
of
it,
i
just
want
knowledge.
some
of
them
--
some
of
the
questions
were
answered?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
was
a
line
drawn
then
or
is
a
line
drawn
now
by
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
if
--
i've
heard
that
there
was
a
counsel
present.
were
you
the
counsel
present
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
so
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
i
don't
think
counsel
will
stop
by
anything
they
do
to
protect
through
their
clients.
is
it
your
position
now
that
some
of
the
questions
are
pertinent?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
these
--
all
these
i
infer
from
what
you've
just
said,
it
seemed
to
you
pertinent
to
the
question
where
they
feel
available
in
case
he
--
or
whether
you
like
it
to
be
--
likely
to
flee,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
relevance
made
a
judgment
on
seven
questions
out
of
nine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
question
of
vagueness
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
eminently
made
a
judgment
of
the
relevance
of
seven
questions
out
of
nine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
if
judge
sullivan's
construction
of
the
statute
could
find
favor
then
these
difficulties
do
not
arise,
do
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
don't
we
have
to
address
ourselves
first
to
the
question
whether
his
construction
is
either
instinctively
called
for
or
called
for
by
our
rule
if
you
don't
go
into
constitutionality
if
you
can
save
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
ask
this
because
i'm
puzzled.
suppose
nothing
had
been
done,
what
would
have
been
--
what
--
what
would
have
followed
the
original
memorandum
or
opinion
of
judge
sullivan?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
if
the
government
hadn't
come
in
for
clarification
and
you
hadn't
come
in
for
dismissal
of
the
indictment.
what
would
have
been
the
course
of
things?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
was
--
i'm
a
little
puzzled
by
it.
what
was
the
implication
of
his
opinion?
did
he
expect
the
government
then
to
move
for
a
trial
and
have
the
question
of
relevance
determined
at
the
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
because
if
this
is
--
intellectual
curiosity
more
than
anything
else
which
directs
some
question.
a
very
surprising
thing
that
a
judge
should
be
asked
to
tell
what
he
meant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
blaming
or
--
or
praising
us.
it
seemed
to
me
he'd
left
and
sort
it
up
in
the
air,
didn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
he
did
the
second
time,
am
i
wrong
about
this?
after
you
--
after
your
motion
for
clarification,
he
then
ruled
on
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
namely,
the
questions
must
relate
to
availability
as
in
(inaudible)
the
indictment
and
said
not
one
of
these
questions
relates
to
that
topic
and
therefore,
you
haven't
stated
out
of
offense
and
therefore,
the
indictment
were
to
be
dismissed.
and
i
should
think
that
followed
logically
from
--
from
the
scope
that
he
gave
to
the
statute,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
might
not
if
you
were
on
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
these
--
may
i
ask,
are
these
conditions
standardized
or
are
they
individualized?
in
other
words
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
mean
are
the
–
are
the
conditions
which
are
imposed
the
same
in
every
case
that
comes
up
in
routine?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
let's
judge
--
this
is
a
good
thing
that
judge
sullivan
like.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
the
carlson
case
but
that's
the
heart
of
judge
sullivan
added
to,
namely,
since
this
statute,
that's
the
(inaudible)
since
he
cannot
be
detained
after
six
month
but
he
is
still
deportable,
that
warrant
is
still
outstanding,
the
inquiries
must
be
directed
towards
securing
the
enforceability
of
what
is
still
an
outstanding
legal
order.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
that's
the
line
you
took
in
answering
70
and
not
over
20
roughly
speaking.
i
don't
mean
to
stop
you
or
anything,
but
i
mean
that's
--
you
acted
on
that
distinction.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
like
a
medicine
now
because
they
have
to
take
the
fifth.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
they
talk
about
that
and
why
we
must
talk
about
it
that
way.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
he
had
learned
on
that
subject,
didn't
he?
he
thought
this
court
was
the
great
tyranny.
justice
felix
frankfurter
first
amendment
probably.
justice
felix
frankfurter
first
amendment
probably.
justice
felix
frankfurter
our
deference
to
chicago
tribune,
its
great
sponsorship
of
that
amendment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
total
under
the
six
months
rule
as
dictated?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
these
are
all
under
the
six
months
rule,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
understand
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
on
the
--
what
i
meant
the
six
months
rule
because
they
belong
to
countries
that
we
find
it
difficult
to
get
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
including
state,
but
isn't
the
chief
reasoned
that
they
belong
to?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
the
stateless
ones,
they
are
good
many
or
some
stateless
ones
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
aren't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
are
these
--
these
none
takings,
take
yugoslavia,
am
i
right
that
--
i
don't
know
how
many
but
i
suspect
there
could
be
instances,
have
nothing
to
do
either
in
determining
whether
he
was
or
wasn't
a
part
of
what
it
is
now
yugoslavia,
what
it
is
now
hungary.
but
it
also
is
part
of
the
general
foothold
of
international
relations
having
nothing
to
do
with
the
individual,
but
being
--
for
reasons
of
the
foreign
office
notions
of
different
countries
saying,
"we
just
do
nothing
about
this
but
these
are
that
reasons."
isn't
that
a
considerable
fashion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
but
if
--
if
an
alien
--
these
are
his
countries
of
first
choice
to
get
his
first
choice.
then,
the
government
tries
to
get

well,
it
doesn't
follow
that
we
have
to
decide
now
what
--
how
a
supervision
one
have
over
aliens
which
the
policy
of
this
country
allows
whom
the
policy
of
his
country
allows
to
remain
here,
i
suppose
we
still
have
what,
two
or
three
million
aliens?
justice
felix
frankfurter

that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
aren't
they
still
about
being
in
the
navy?
