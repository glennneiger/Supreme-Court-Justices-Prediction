out
of
what
committee
did
this
statute
come,
judiciary?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
consists
of
lawyers,
doesn't
it?
justice

well,

the
fbi
record
is
now
part
of
legislative
history.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
record
would
give
us
the
legislative
history,
even
the
fbi
reports.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
stating
the
legislative
report
that
bears
explicit
on
the
meaning
of
a
phrase
that
has
a
lawyer's
meaning
reported
by
a
lawyer's
committee
without
any
definition
that
is
to
be
taken
by
a
non-lawyer
committee.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
taken
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
suggest
that
looking
at
the
textbooks,
they
meant
textbooks
are
under
criminal
law.
did
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
did
you
(inaudible)
meant
textbooks
under
criminal
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
get
--
go
to
those
to
get
into
trouble.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
--
in
that
type
of
legislation,
there
is
usually
a
definition,
an
increasing
definition
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
about
deprivation
of
property
may
be
prosecuted
as
for
larceny,
am
i
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
done
in
order
to
avoid
implication,
the
natural
or
reasonable
implication
if
the
common
law
concept
survived
if
you
don't
change
it
by
statute
so
as
to
make
it
as
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
a
very
good
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
these
figures
--
do
these
figures
of
the
fbi
indicate
a
relative
proportion
of
outright
theft
of
cars
and
subsequent
appropriation
of
cars
properly
in
the
possession
of
a
--
of
a
driver?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
car
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
don't
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
a
bad
--
that's
a
bad
reason
for
giving
us
or
assuming
that
congress
introduced
language
in
making
federal
offenses
or
status
quo
whether
the
--
well
within
the
domain
of
the
state.
it's
not
a
very
good
immunity,
it's
not
one
of
the
things
to
meet.
the
whole
point
about
them,
about
making
things
crime
is
that
it
should
be
specific
with
the
law
as
the
english
language
more
or
less
permits.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
whole
of
the
dialect
was
a
considerable
angle
upon
state
exclusiveness.
it
was
not
without
authorization
and
it
was
not
without
considerable
concern
that
you
should
not
take
these
things
over
from
state
prosecutions.
so,
they're
very
good
in
this.
why
do
you
want
to
give
it
a
restrictive
meaning?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
no.
why
--
why
can
he
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
that
if
a
man
instantly
borrows
a
car.
he
secures
an
(inaudible)
drives
to
state
one
then
driving
into
another
state
and
then
he
finds
the
car
there,
trying
to
say,
“i
think
i'll
keep
it.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
new
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
suppose
he
doesn't
in
the
state
of
maryland?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
doesn't
--
he
doesn't
make
up
his
mind
to
retain
it
permanently
until
he
gets
to
maryland.
is
that
the
new
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
--
how
many
--
do
you
happen
to
have
plenty
at
hand
the
number
of
prosecutions
of
the
dyer
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
statute
looks
to
offenses
mostly
knowing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
that's
what
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
extensively,
that
statute
is
not
uncommon
because
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
--
have
you
examined
other
statutes
of
the
united
states
in
which
congress
has
not
done
what
california
is
supposed
to
maintain
in
respect
to
the
judge,
but
has
adhered
to
the
decisions
being
larceny
and
embezzlement.
receiving
stolen
property
within
margin
and
territorial
provisions,
talked
about
whether
those
laws,
they
see
that
the
legal
was
good
back
on
which
may
be
the
subject
of
larceny
that
has
been
promoted,
taken,
stolen,
or
embezzlement,
and
several
statutes
in
which
congress
has
passed
it
around
and
generalizes
the
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
federal,
i'm
talking
about
federal
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
they
revised
it
when
they
got
around
to
revise
it.
he's
talking
about
simplifying
and
taking
out
devious
words
and
combining,
left
only
differentiations
on
construing
this.
