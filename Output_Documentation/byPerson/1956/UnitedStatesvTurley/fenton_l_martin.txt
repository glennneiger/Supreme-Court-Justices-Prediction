mr.
fenton
l.
martin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government,
which
is
the
dyer
act
to
cover
all
kinds
of
misappropriations
of
vehicles
which
are
transported
across
state
lines,
the
government
has
asked
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
congress
amend
the
dyer
act
to
say
specifically
what
the
government
is
contending
for
here
today.
they
are
bound
successful
in
the
attempt
to
secure
congressional
amendment
and
so
--
mr.
fenton
l.
martin
it
is
referred
to
your
honor,
in
the
government's
brief
on
page
--
pages
14
and
15.
they
have
asked
that
the
act
be
broadened
so
that
it
covers
such
language
as
embezzle,
feloniously
converted
or
feloniously
taken
by
fraud.
those
amendments
have
failed
the
passage.
so
today,
the
government
is
here
asking
this
court
to
declare
that
the
dyer
act
is
meant
all
along
what
congress
has
failed
to
amend
it
to
mean.
the
only
real
argument
advanced
by
the
government
in
support
of
its
position
is
the
fact
that
congress
would
have
no
reason
to
differentiate
between
these
various
types
of
takings
of
automobiles
when
congress
passed
the
statute.
i
think
that
there
are
reasons
for
such
differentiation.
first,
i
think
that
we
should
bear
in
mind
the
time
when
this
statute
was
passed.
the
statute
was
passed
in
1919.
at
that
time,
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
itself
was
in
doubt.
there
was
some
discussion
as
to
whether
the
interstate
commerce
clause
was
adequate
to
cover
the
transportation
that
the
dyer
act
sought
to
prohibit.
that
question
was
finally
resolved
by
this
court
in
the
brooks
case
in
267
united
states.
i
would
like,
if
i
might,
to
read
one
sentence
from
the
brooks
opinion.
this
court
said,
“elaborately
organized
conspiracies
for
the
theft
of
automobiles
and
spiriting
them
away
into
some
other
state
and
their
sale
or
other
disposition
far
away
from
the
owner
and
his
neighborhood
have
roused
congress
to
devise
some
method
for
defeating
the
success
of
the
widely
spread
schemes
of
larceny.”
mr.
fenton
l.
martin
that,
your
honor,
is
brooks
versus
united
states
in
267
united
states.
mr.
fenton
l.
martin
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not
cited.
mr.
fenton
l.
martin
yes.
mr.
fenton
l.
martin
i
believe
that
it
died.
i
could
find
no
reference
to
this
having
been
voted
on.
mr.
fenton
l.
martin
i
don't
believe
so,
but
i'm
not
positive,
your
honor.
mr.
fenton
l.
martin
oh,
it's
a
senate
report,
yes
sir.
mr.
fenton
l.
martin
i
believe
that
the
--
mr.
fenton
l.
martin
there
were
several
amendments
offered
since
1948
after
the
hite
decision.
none
of
those
were
successful.
as
far
as
i
know,
none
of
them
were
rather
voted
on
by
the
house
of
congress.
mr.
fenton
l.
martin
the
significance
i
think,
your
honor,
is
that
this
court
when
it
was
first
placed
with
the
dyer
act,
it
felt
that
the
dyer
act
was
aimed
at
organized
conspiracies
of
thieves
who
had
“schemes
of
larceny”
to
take
cars
across
state
lines
and
sell
them,
the
point
being
that
these
organized
groups
of
thieves
operate
in
ways
which
are
traditionally
within
the
framework
of
common-law
larceny.
this
court
so
thought,
the
lower
court
in
this
case
so
thought,
and
it
was
admitted
by
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
this
was
the
situation
which
primarily
motivated
the
congress
when
they
passed
the
dyer
act.
i'm
referring
now
to
smith
versus
united
states,
one
of
the
cases
giving
a
broad
construction
to
the
dyer
act,
withholding
that
they
must
admit
that
typically
an
unattended
car
is
taken
and
that
this
is
the
traditional
form
of
common-law
larceny.
i
think
then
that
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
suspect
that
congress
did
not
have
in
mind
all
of
the
various
ramification
of
wrongful
taking
at
the
time
that
this
act
was
passed.
congress
was
acting
or
reacting
to
a
need.
there
was
a
clearly
felt
need
and
the
conscious
action
of
the
congress
was
directed
toward
common-law
larceny.
now,
there
are
other
indications
of
that
fact
which
i
feel
in
all
frankness
are
not
determined,
given
in
anyway
of
the
issues
in
this
case.
for
example,
the
title
of
the
act,
the
motor
vehicle
theft
act.
the
government
argues
in
its
brief
that
the
word
"theft"
is
broader
than
common-law
larceny,
and
it
cites
bouvier's
law
dictionary
for
that
proposition.
i
feel
that
the
word
"theft"
is
a
synonym
for
larceny.
it
was
soused
by
blackstone.
other
cases
have
indicated
that
the
word
“theft”
is
a
synonym
for
larceny
as
understood
at
common
law.
there's
the
matter
of
senator
nelson's
statement
about
the
textbooks.
that
was
a
statement
made
during
the
course
of
debate
and
perhaps
is
not
entitled
of
great
significance,
but
surely
it
must
refer
to
common-law
larceny
and
to
treat
as
is
that
so
define
common-law
larceny.
now,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
dyer
act
is
not
itself
conclusive,
comes
in
paramount
importance,
i
think
to
consider
the
word
that
congress
used
in
the
act
itself,
the
word
“stolen”
and
the
meaning
of
the
word
“stolen”.
in
this
regard,
we
have
i
think
the
help
of
a
number
of
set
of
rules
of
statutory
construction.
it
should
be
presumed
that
congress
understood
when
it
used
the
word
“stolen”
in
the
dyer
act,
that
a
common-law
term
which
is
used
in
a
criminal
statute
and
is
not
otherwise
defined
by
the
text
takes
its
common
law
meaning.
now,
i
have
cited
in
the
brief
a
number
of
decisions
of
state
courts
holding
most
emphatically
that
the
word
"steal"
is
synonymous
with
the
word
“larceny”
as
understood
at
common
law.
now,
it
is
true
that
the
word
“larceny”
is
not
often
defined
by
use
of
the
word
“steal”.
it
is,
however,
also
true
that
the
word
“larceny”
in
its
traditional
definition
is
also
--
or
that
the
traditional
definition
given
to
the
word
“larceny”
at
common
law
is
also
the
traditional
definition
of
the
word
“steal”.
now,
there
are
other
definitions
of
the
word
“steal”
over
and
above
broader
than
the
common-law
larceny.
but
in
all
of
the
dictionaries,
i
think,
the
definition
which
coincides
with
common-law
larceny
is
the
primary
meaning
given.
the
other
meanings
are
given
as
second
and
additional
meanings
as
funk
and
wagnalls
says
in
definition
too
loosely
to
acquire
by
other
means
than
stealing
--
than
larceny.
i
think
we
must
presume
that
congress
intended
to
use
the
word
in
its
primary
and
most
important
and
well-understood
sense,
rather
than
in
a
loose
and
largely
undefined
sense
when
it
passed
the
dyer
act.
i
think
congress
must
be
presumed
to
understand
that
criminal
statutes
are
traditionally
strictly
construed
and
that
clear
and
unequivocal
language
must
be
in
an
act
before
it
will
be
extended
by
court
to
cover
other
offenses
not
clearly
within
the
meaning
of
the
words
used.
now,
i
think
also
with
respect
to
the
matter
of
purpose
of
the
act,
that
the
history
of
the
dyer
act
in
connection
with
the
national
stolen
property
act
and
the
national
stolen
cattle
act
is
important.
the
dyer
act
was
passed
in
1919.
it
uses
only
the
word
“stolen”.
it
is
the
contention
of
the
appellee.
of
course,
the
word
“stolen”
refers
to
the
traditional
kind
of
common-law
larceny.
and
when
in
1934,
the
national
stolen
property
act
sections
were
passed
relating
to
securities
and
money
transported
across
state
lines
or
the
receipt
of
securities
and
money
which
were
transported
across
state
lines,
that
act
used
other
--
an
additional
words
to
the
word
“stolen”,
which
clearly
indicated
an
intention
to
broaden
the
scope
of
the
--
meaning
of
the
act.
the
reason
i
think
is
that
securities
and
moneys
are
more
traditionally
subject
to
taking
by
embezzlement
than
would
be
an
automobile.
when
later
in
1941
the
national
cattle
theft
act
was
passed,
again,
the
congress
reverted
to
the
use
of
the
word
"stolen"
alone.
that
act
also
says
simply
knowing
the
same
to
have
been
stolen.
can
we
not
see
that
the
reason
for
that
is
that
cattle
are
traditionally
stolen
in
a
sense
of
taking
which
would
be
common-law
larceny?
it
is
not
often
i
think
that
cattle
are
embezzled.
congress
felt
no
need
to
extend
the
scope
of
the
statute
beyond
the
common-law
larceny
type
of
situation.
when
title
xviii
of
u.s.c.
was
codified
in
1948,
all
of
the
sections
were
adopted
and
put
under
one
heading,
but
they
all
retained
their
own
words
as
they
had
before.
so,
with
the
dyer
act
stole
--
says
"stolen”,
the
act
relating
to
securities
and
money
contains
additional
phraseology
and
the
cattle
act
also
says
"stolen".
mr.
fenton
l.
martin
i
think
there
are,
your
honor,
a
great
many.
mr.
fenton
l.
martin
well,
a
number
of
those
cases
are
cited.
the
language
from
them
i
should
say
is
cited
in
the
appellee's
brief,
beginning
on
page
7
and
continuing
through
page
11.
those
cases
have
--
in
the
vast
majority
of
instances
held
that
the
word
"steal"
or
"stolen”
means
common-law
larceny.
in
fact,
the
courts
have
been
most
emphatic
about
it.
the
north
dakota
court
quoted
on
page
7,
said
that
“steal”
was
a
word
of
art
imposing
--
importing
a
common-law
larceny.
mr.
fenton
l.
martin
i
am
not
aware
of
the
wording
of
the
california
statutes,
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
fenton
l.
martin
the
purposes
have
no
bearing
--
mr.
fenton
l.
martin
in
virginia,
they
now
have
a
statute
which
is
that
comprehensive
but
the
prosecuting
attorney
--
mr.
fenton
l.
martin
yes,
your
honor,
but
maybe,
i
have
no
figures
on
it.
i
do
know
that
not
all
states
have
such
statute.
mr.
fenton
l.
martin
a
great
many
of
those,
your
honor,
page
11
of
my
brief,
footnote
16.
i
would
ask
by
--
by
glancing
at
it
now
about
10
to
15
such
statutes.
the
language
--
mr.
fenton
l.
martin
federal,
your
honor.
they
are
in
the
--
in
title
xviii,
section
641,
655,
656
and
--
mr.
fenton
l.
martin
i
think
--
mr.
fenton
l.
martin
yes,
your
honor,
they
did.
i
think
that
congress
had
many
words
at
its
disposal,
had
it
wished
the
dyer
act
to
cover
other
than
common-law
larceny.
now,
i
would
like
to
make
it
quite
clear
that
i'm
not
saying
that
the
word
"stolen"
cannot
mean
something
broader
than
common-law
larceny
or
that
it
cannot
mean
something
broader
than
common-law
larceny
in
the
criminal
statute.
the
point
is
that
if
the
word
is
otherwise
undefined,
it
takes
the
meaning
of
common-law
larceny.
the
courts
that
have
held
adverse
to
my
position
here
have
quoted
liberally
from
crabb
versus
zerbst
and
from
united
states
versus
stone,
cited
in
my
brief
on
page
19
and
on
page
20.
those
cases
are
often
cited
as
authority
for
the
fact
that
the
word
"stolen"
has
a
broader
meaning
than
that
of
common-law
larceny.
but
in
those
cases
and
in
each
of
the
other
cases
cited
by
the
government,
the
statute
was
broader
in
its
own
language
than
is
the
dyer
act.
that
was
pointed
out
quite
clearly
by
judge
hammond
in
the
united
states
versus
stone
case,
when
he
said
that
“in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
word
"stolen"
can
mean
more
than
common-law
larceny,
i
would
hold
it
here
to
mean
only
common-law
larceny,”
and
this
case
involve
stealing
goods
from
a
wreck
within
the
maritime
jurisdiction,
were
it
not
for
the
fact
with
the
word
"stolen"
in
that
statute
was
joined
with
the
words
“plunder”
and
“destroy,”
and
the
use
of
those
additional
words
show
the
clear
congressional
intent
to
encompass
the
whole
field
of
taking
from
the
vessel.
but
absent
such
additional
words,
judge
hammond
said
that
he
would
be
constrained
to
hold
that
statute
applicable
only
to
common-law
larceny.
and
that
is
the
distinguishing
point
in
all
of
these
cases
that
the
fourth,
sixth
and
ninth
circuits
have
relied
upon
in
holding
the
dyer
act
to
have
a
broad
meaning.
i
think
it's
important
to
consider
also
what
the
dyer
act
means
if
it
does
not
mean
common-law
larceny.
a
lot
of
loose
language
has
been
used
in
giving
meaning
to
the
dyer
act
in
the
broader
sense.
the
traditional
definition
used
by
the
fourth,
sixth
and
ninth
circuits
is
that
it
covers
any
misappropriation
without
right
or
law.
other
expressions
have
been
to
any
wrongful
taking,
any
dishonest
taking,
any
unlawful
taking
and
so
forth.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
if
the
act
were
so
broadly
construed,
it
would
be
vague
and
indefinite
to
the
extent
that
a
constitutional
issue
might
arise.
and
that
the
court
in
considering
what
congress
met
when
it
passed
the
dyer
act
should
consider
that
congress
would
have
desired
to
avoid
any
conceivable
constitutional
issue
in
using
the
word
“stolen.”
and
that
leads
us
again
to
the
belief
that
the
word
means
common-law
larceny
alone.
