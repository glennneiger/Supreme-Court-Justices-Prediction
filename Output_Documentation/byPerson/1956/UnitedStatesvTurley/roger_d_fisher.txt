mr.
roger
d.
fisher
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case,
the
united
states
against
turley,
reaches
this
court
on
direct
appeal
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
maryland.
the
sole
issue
involved
is
the
meaning
of
the
word
“stolen”
as
used
in
the
national
motor
vehicle
theft
act.
in
april
1956,
an
amended
information
was
filed
against
the
defendant
in
the
district
court.
there
was
only
one
count.
it
appears
on
page
4
of
the
record.
your
honors
would
--
in
front
of
you,
i
think
it
will
help
get
the
facts
very
clearly
in
mind.
the
information
alleged
that
a
year
ago,
january
1956,
james
turley
did
lawfully
obtain
a
certain
ford
automobile
from
its
owner,
with
permission
of
the
owner
to
use
the
automobile
briefly,
on
that
day
to
transport
certain
of
their
friends
to
the
homes
of
the
latter
in
columbia,
south
carolina,
and
to
return
with
them.
but
that
after
so
obtaining
the
automobile
and
transporting
said
persons
to
their
homes,
and
before
returning
with
them
or
delivering
back
the
automobile
to
its
owner,
turley,
without
permission
of
the
owner,
and
with
the
intent
in
south
carolina
to
steal
the
automobile,
did
convert
the
same
into
his
own
use
and
did
unlawfully
transport
it
in
interstate
commerce
from
south
carolina
to
baltimore,
maryland,
knowing
it
to
have
been
stolen,
where
he
did
on
the
next
day,
sell
the
automobile
without
permission
of
the
owner.
the
statute
involved
is
even
shorter.
it's
one
sentence.
it
appears
on
page
2
of
the
government's
brief,
“whoever
transports
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
a
motor
vehicle
or
aircraft,
knowing
the
same
to
have
been
stolen,
shall
be
fined
not
more
than
$5000
or
imprisoned
not
more
than
five
years
or
both.”
the
defendant
moved
to
dismiss
the
information
on
the
ground
that
it
did
not
state
an
offense
against
the
united
states.
the
district
court
construed
the
word
“stolen”
in
the
statute
as
applying
only
to
those
motor
vehicles
which
had
been
acquired
in
such
a
way
that
their
acquisition
would
have
constituted
the
offense
of
larceny
as
understood
at
common
law.
the
district
court
then
found
that
the
circumstances
here
involved
would
not
have
involved
the
offense
of
larceny
as
understood
at
common
law
and
dismissed
the
information.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
right.
the
--
the
whole
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
case
comes
up
to
you
on
the
information
and
its
dismissal.
the
united
states
agrees
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
--
the
conduct
be
--
would
not
have
constituted
the
offense
of
larceny
at
common
law.
so,
the
sole
issue
is
one
of
statutory
construction
as
to
whether
the
word
“stolen”,
as
used
in
this
act,
is
limited
to
those
stolen
vehicles
and
limited
to
those
vehicles
that
require
in
a
manner
which
would
have
constituted
common-law
larceny
or
whether
“stolen”
has
the
more
common
everyday
meaning
of
a
stolen
car,
a
hot
car
is
used,
generally
understood
in
the
contemporary
community.
the
government's
position
in
the
word
“stolen”
is
used
in
the
general
accepted
--
generally
accepted
meaning
of
having
been
taken
from
one's
own
use
without
right
and
with
the
intent
to
deprive
the
owner
of
it.
we
--
more
technically,
we
think
that
stolen
vehicles
are
those
taken
by
any
of
the
theft
crimes,
namely,
larceny,
larceny
by
trick,
false
pretenses
or
embezzlement.
we
do
not
think
the
word
should
be
construed
that
a
stolen
vehicle
should
be
analogized
to
a
verb
stealing,
take
one
--
taken
by
stealing
that
stealing
necessarily
means
larceny,
that
larceny
means
larceny
as
defined
at
common
law
for
there
were
statutory
crimes,
embezzlement
and
so
forth.
the
appellee's
position
here
is
basically
that
criminal
statute
must
be
construed
narrowly,
that
as
between
the
two
meanings
that
might
be
given
to
stolen,
the
common-law
definition
is
narrower
and
he
suggest
more
definite.
he
concludes
that
under
the
statute,
no
vehicle
could
be
considered
a
stolen
vehicle
but
the
circumstances
in
which
were
acquired
would
have
constituted
larceny
as
understood
at
common
law.
the
--
there
is
no
definition
of
stolen
in
the
statute.
the
legislative
history
is
not
decisive.
we
get
some
help
from
it,
but
i
will
touch
on
that
in
a
moment.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
what
i'm
just
going
to
say.
there
are
--
this
--
this
matter
is
one
that
comes
up
frequently.
there
are
three
circuit
courts
of
appeal
that
had
decided.
the
fourth,
sixth
and
ninth
had
decided
that
larceny
--
that
stolen
vehicles
are
not
limited,
those
taken
by
common-law
larceny.
the
second
circuit
has
dictum
to
the
same
effect.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
it
came
out
of
judiciary.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
it
--
it
consists
of
some
lawyers,
i'm
sure
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
at
the
time
it
did.
i'm
not
--
i
have
not
checked
the
--
who
the
--
who
the
committee
was
at
the
time.
in
--
the
statute
was
adopted
in
1919
and
there
was
some
discussion
at
that
time
of
the
problem,
the
insurance
rates
on
stolen
vehicles
that
are
going
up.
mr.
dyer's
made
a
report
to
the
house
committee
on
the
extent
of
vehicles
that
were
stolen.
one
of
our
points
on
legislative
history
is
that
the
table
of
--
of
--
given
to
the
figures
included
in
the
committee
report
for
stolen
vehicles
from
21
so
cities,
indicating
some
20,000
cars
have
been
stolen.
that
those
figures,
the
best
we
can
ascertain
would
have
included
vehicles
obtained
by
any
theft
crime
as
reported
by
stolen.
the
fbi
is
--
knows
of
no
jurisdiction
which
now
or
anytime
as
reported
stolen
vehicles
only
limited
that
class
taken
by
common-law
larceny.
the
--
the
figures
before
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
them
were
dealing
--
your
honor?
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
the
record
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
figures
--
the
legislative
history
contains
the
--
the
figures
on
the
number
of
cars
stolen
in
these
cities,
yes,
sir.
your
honor,
the
report
of
--
the
report
which
--
parts
of
which
are
referred
to
in
both
briefs
is
rep.
no.
312,
66th
cong.
,
1st
sess.
that
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
one
discussion
by
lawyers
of
the
language
of
the
bill
occurred
on
the
senate
floor,
where
the
--
there
was
language
in
the
statute.
the
statute
originally
read
--
the
succeeding
section,
which
also
has
the
word
“stolen”
in
it,
originally
read
that
“whoever
shall,
with
the
intent
to
deprive
the
owner
of
the
possession
thereof,
receive,
conceal,
store,
barter,
sell
or
dispose
of
any
motor
vehicle
moving
as,
or
which
the
part
of,
or
which
constitutes
interstate
or
foreign
commerce,
knowing
the
same
to
have
been
stolen.”
this
phrase
“with
the
intent
to
deprive
the
owner
of
the
possession
thereof”
was
deleted
by
the
senate
and
remained
out
of
the
bill.
the
only
language
discussing
it
--
that's
--
at
all
useful
is
that
which
appears
on
page
13
of
the
government's
brief,
where
senator
nelson,
who
was
not
the
senator
who
proposed
the
deletion
but
--
explained
--
he's
the
only
one
who
really
commented
on
the
problem,
says
that
the
senator
--
it's
on
page
13
of
the
government's
brief,
the
senator
from
iowa
allowed
me
a
desire
to
say
to
examine
the
authorities
upon
one
of
the
elements
of
the
offense
of
stealing
is
a
deprivation
of
the
owner
of
the
things
stolen
without
his
consent.
the
words
referred
to
by
the
senator
from
connecticut
do
no
harm,
though
they
are
really
surplusage.
their
meaning
is
implied
in
the
word
“theft”
or
in
the
“stealing”.
if
the
senator
will
look
at
the
textbooks,
he'll
find
that
a
part
of
the
element
of
the
offense
to
deprive
the
owner
thereof
without
his
consent.
the
statute
as
it
was
then
being
considered
had
the
intent
to
deprive
the
owner
taking
place
at
the
time
that
the
automobile
was
to
be
received,
concealed,
stored,
bartered
or
sold,
disposed
of.
the
intent
was
--
was
specifically
to
take
care
the
intent
to
deprive
the
owner
to
use
referred
to
at
that
time.
the
fact
that
it
was
considered
to
be
surplusage
indicates
that
they
understood
that
theft
will
include
depriving
the
owner,
dishonestly,
this
property,
whether
the
intent
occurred
at
the
time
the
automobile
was
originally
acquired
or
whether
the
intent
occurred
at
the
time
it
was
disposed
of.
i
don't
think
that
we
can
make
too
much
of
this.
i
only
think
--
i
don't
think
i
can
say
--
say
this
is
controlling,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
the
only
legislative
history
we
have
aside
from
the
fact
that
figures
were
used
for
stolen
cars,
which
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
we're
limited
to
cars
taken
by
larceny
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
by
common-law.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
and
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
think
so,
and
i
think
that
there
are
a
number
of
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
word
“stolen”
has
a
long
history
and
has
never
been
used
until
recently
as
the
same
as
technical
common-law
larceny.
it
has
been
used
by
non-lawyers
and
by
others
from
way
back,
including
the
sense
of
embezzlement.
i
--
i
went
through
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
there
was
never
a
common-law
crime
of
stealing
in
our
common
law.
the
crime
of
larceny
was
expanded
by
judicial
decision
from
that
constituting
a
trespass
at
the
time
to
where
you
could
assume
a
trespass,
where
there
was
a
--
a
fraud.
you
acquired
the
possession
by
fraud,
and
they
said
constructed
trespass
where
a
servant
had
the
property,
and
they
said,
“well,
they
had
custody
and
not
possession
and
therefore,
there
was
a
trespass
when
he
changed
from
custody
to
possession.”
and
right
on
the
breaking
of
the
bulk
cases,
where
a
man
takes
a
barrel
of
wine
and
he
opens
the
barrel,
they
say,
“well,
although
the
barrel
was
given
to
him
rightfully,
it's
not
embezzlement.
it's
a
--
it's
larceny
because
he
committed
the
wrongful
act
in
opening
the
barrel.”
the
--
the
crime
of
larceny
was
expanded
steadily
by
judicial
decision
until
various
embezzlement
statutes,
and
the
--
the
reason
it
has
never
got
beyond
where
it
got
100
years
ago
is
that
most
states,
at
least
in
this
country,
completely
have
made
these
crimes
dealt
by
statute.
and
in
many
states,
larceny
by
statute
is
expanded
to
include
the
offenses
that
we're
talking
about
here.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
right.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
it's
done
a
number
of
ways,
your
honor.
that's
a
frequent
way
to
say
this
will
constitute
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
larceny.
in
other
way,
they
say
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
the
--
i
would
like
to
say
that
while
the
common
law
was
developing,
the
word
“stolen”
was
not
--
it
was
being
used
in
the
earliest
days.
oxford
dictionary
traced
it
back
to
1380
and
earlier
where
stolen
is
used.
in
--
in
the
15th
century,
there
are
two
cases,
instance
that
they
give
and
examples
of
the
use
of
the
word
and
it
would
include
what
we
would
call
embezzlement.
the
example
given
where
in
the
--
where
they're
referring
to
gospel
of
st.
john
where
judas
bear
the
person
stole
that
which
was
given
to
christ,
12th
chapter
in
john,
where
there
--
this
is
a
discussion
commentary
in
the
15th
century.
in
the
--
1640,
other
reference
to
it
that
the
--
by
the
protestants
and
the
church
were
fighting
that
the
church
is
merely
--
the
wealth
of
the
church
is
--
is
stolen
wealth,
clearly
not
taken,
not
any
idea.
this
was
taken
by
common-law
larceny.
the
word
“stolen”
has
had
two
meanings.
i
appeal
to
justice
frankfurter
that
one
meaning
is
the
narrow
technical
one
of
common-law
larceny.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
can
suggest
none.
appellee
suggests
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
two
reasons.
one
is
that
the
concept
of
larceny
is
more
clear-cut
and
they
wanted
the
statute
to
be
definite.
and
the
other
is
that
it's
narrower
and
that
you
shouldn't
presume
between
choice
to
--
to
the
broader.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
we
think
so.
we
think
that
the
--
if
you
consider
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
which
was
automobiles
are
kind
of
property
that
can
quickly
move
from
one
state
to
another.
that
there
is
no
way
of
catching
the
thief
without
elaborate
extradition,
unless
the
federal
government
can
step
in,
use
its
facilities
to
get
from
one
state
to
the
other
to
find
out
where
the
car
is
in
the
traffic.
currently
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
we
--
we
have
--
the
only
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
simply
right
on
that.
the
reason
we
do
not
is
the
uniform
crime
reporting
system
adopted
by
all
the
states
in
1930
has
--
has
for
all
its
crimes.
they
have
theft
crimes.
they
have
embezzlement
crimes
then
they
may
have
auto
theft.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
and
auto
theft
is
dealing
with
the
entire
merged
offense,
the
frequent
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
the
policy
behind
strict
construction
of
criminal
statutes
to
relieve
innocent
--
where
you're
drawing
a
boundary
between
innocent
conduct
and
criminal
conduct.
i
think
that
somewhat
last
year,
we
were
drawing
the
line
between
criminal
conduct,
which
is
already
criminal
to
be
punished
by
the
states,
the
federal
government
part
of
it
or
should
the
federal
government
help
the
states
enforcing
the
additional
element
that
we're
here
discussing,
here
involved.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
intent
with
the
inaccurate
information
goes
on
to
say
and
with
the
intent
to
steal
in
south
carolina,
converted
the
same
to
his
own
use
and
drove
up
to
baltimore.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
precise
point
where
the
theft
occurred
on
his
route
from
the
friend's
house
to
baltimore,
i
don't
think
we
have
to
establish
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
it
took
place
in
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
in
south
carolina.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
his
intent
in
south
carolina
is
to
call
the
car
briefly
to
return
it
back
in
south
--
in
columbia,
where
they
met
to
and
he
then,
instead
of
returning
the
car
to
the
owner,
he
drove
up
to
--
to
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
baltimore.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
well
--
or
--
or
in
the
next
state.
he
still
has
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
and
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
and
then
drives
from
that
state
up
to
maryland
and
sells
it,
then
it
falls
in
the
statute.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
i'm
not
--
the
state
--
he
drove
from
south.
my
geography
may
be
brief
but
i
believe
from
south
carolina
to
maryland,
you
do
have
to
go
through
one
other
state.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no.
not
as
really
the
statute,
no.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
problem
i'd
like
to
speak.
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
justice
brennan,
where
we
have
in
effect
stipulated
the
--
the
information
was
drafted
between
the
government
and
counsel
to
state
the
fact
as
to
when
his
intent
took
place
in
south
carolina
and
there
he
started
--
from
there,
he
started
driving
north.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
in
--
in
columbia,
south
carolina
we
say
he
embezzled
the
car,
which
we
say
is
stealing
under
this
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
statute.
i
would
like
to
get
right
to
that
point
because,
well,
on
this
case,
it
is
said
that
it's
stolen
there.
this
will
be
--
a
statute
will
be
impossible
to
administer
construed
as
three
circuits
have
construed
it
and
not
as
the
other
three
have
construed
it.
take
two
cases,
current
types
of
cases,
both
of
which
have
been
litigated.
take
the
turley
case
right
here.
if
the
federal
statute
is
limited
to
common-law
larceny,
the
state
authorities
will
not
know
what
is
the
federal
offense
in
which
they
can
call
in
the
fbi
to
help
get
them
on
it
or
not.
unless
they
can
figure
out
what
--
whether
turley
deceived
his
friend
when
he
borrowed
the
car
or
whether
he
would
change
his
mind
later
because
if
he
got
the
car
by
fraud,
it
will
be
larceny
by
trick
then
the
possession
will
fall
in
the
common-law
definition.
he
changed
his
mind
a
block
later.
he
decided
to
go
up
to
the
car
then
it
would
be
embezzlement.
the
statute
would
not
cover
it.
so,
the
line
between
state
and
federal
help
on
acquiring
cars
would
turn
on
someone's
guessing
what
mr.
turley's
mind
was
like
at
the
moment
he
said,
“i'll
borrow
your
car
and
i'll
drive
his
friends
to
their
houses.”
now,
we
have
stipulated
here
to
raise
the
issue
which
has
come
up
now
in
seven
--
six
circuits.
we
want
a
decision
on
it
that
his
--
he
borrowed
it
honestly
and
he
then
changed
his
mind,
embezzled.
but
if
the
construction
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
well,
you've
got
a
--
a
difficult
problem
of
the
--
i
think
they
would
operate
the
way
they've
been
operating
since
those
decisions
but
the
--
they've
been
assuming
that
they
haven't.
but
the
same
case
takes
place
when
you
have
a
rented
car,
same
problem
whether
he
--
when
he
rented
the
car
and
he
acquired
possession
by
trick,
finding
to
go
off
with
it
or
whether
he
acquired
possession,
changed
his
mind
later.
in
more
frequent
cases,
the
installment
purchase
of
a
car,
here,
if
he
gives
a
bad
check
on
an
installment
purchase,
buy
the
new
automobile
and
gives
the
down
payment
with
a
bad
check
intending
to
--
to
fraud.
if
you're
in
a
state
where
the
seller's
interest
is
a
title
interest,
the
seller
keeps
the
title.
he
only
gives
possession
then
you've
got
a
case
where
it
will
fall
under
larceny
by
trick
because
he
only
gave
up
possession.
if
you
have
a
state
where
the
more
--
the
seller's
interest
is
a
land
and
he
intended
the
title
to
pass,
you
will
find
that
this
is
a
false
pretenses,
and
not
common-law
larceny,
and
not
covered.
now,
in
the
hite
case,
which
in
1948,
29
years
after
the
statute
was
passed
for
the
first
case
to
hold
that
“stolen”
was
not
the
definition
we
urge
for
but
was
limited
to
common-law
larceny.
in
that
very
case,
the
hite
case
in
the
tenth
circuit,
the
court
looked
to
the
oklahoma
mortgage
statute
on
automobiles
in
order
to
find
out
whether
the
seller
had
intended
title
to
pass
or
had
intended
to
keep
the
title,
which
would
have
made
it
or
not
a
common-law
larceny
offense.
i
might
say
that
following
that
decision,
people
who
had
been
convicted
and
plead
guilty
to
having
stolen
a
car
before
are
then
brought
2255
actions
and
were
released
on
the
ground
they
thought
they'd
stolen
the
car.
their
lawyer
thought
they'd
stolen
a
car.
i
wouldn't
thought
they'd
stolen
a
car,
but
the
tenth
circuit
now
held
that
this
was
not
a
stolen
car
and
so
people
who
were
serving
time
were
then
released
on
the
misconstruction
of
the
statute.
that
is
the
reason
another
point
on
two
other
briefly
touched
on
construing
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
at
common-law.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
right.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
right,
that's
right.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
basically
our
position,
that
the
word
"stolen
vehicle,"
whether
the
verb
to
steal
is
used
only
as
to
larceny,
i
think
there's
a
slight
difference.
but
when
you
get
to
past
participle
of
stolen,
the
status
of
the
car,
this
statute
only
deals
--
and
i
think
that's
why
they
--
the
statute
that's
been
passed
only
said
stolen,
because
it
only
deals
--
it
doesn't
deal
of
the
taking
of
the
car
the
way
the
statutes
--
stealing
government
property
is
going
to
embezzlement
or
other
languages.
this
deals
with
the
status
of
a
vehicle
that
has
been
dishonestly
moved
by
intent
to
deprive
the
owner
of
it
and
move
to
another
state.
it's
a
--
it's
a
stolen
car.
if
--
if
--
i
have
a
hard
time
explaining
the
principle
of
this
case
is
going
to
about.
they
said
they're
stolen
cars.
they
aren't
stolen
cars
because
in
18th
century,
trespass
would
lie
on
the
original
taking
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
concept
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
right.
you
could
--
i'm
--
i'm
--
i'd
like
to
suggest
the
two
reasons.
one
is
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
this
particular
kind,
false
pretenses
and
embezzlement,
is
where
they
included
in
the
statute.
it's
now
been
decided
by
six
circuit
courts
and
is
a
frequent
cause
of
study.
it
comes
up
fairly
often.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
direct
convictions,
about
90%
convictions
were
obtained
on
--
on
--
convictions
were
about
15,000
convictions.
oh,
excuse
me,
5000
convictions,
15,000
interstate
transportation
of
stolen
vehicles
were
--
were
recovered
by
the
fbi.
you
don't
know
how
many
are
interstate
until
you
get
the
car
back
because
they
report
a
car
as
being
stolen,
so
about
15,000
interstate
stolen
vehicles
recovered,
5000
--
about
4700
convictions
were
obtained.
it's
five
times
as
many
convictions
obtained
under
this
statute
as
per
any
other
offense
of
which
the
fbi
has
presented.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
have
not
got
the
figures.
there
--
maybe
they
do
not
have
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
knowing
to
have
been
stolen.
let's
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
the
basis
--
the
one
reason
the
fbi
was
concerned
about
this
matter
is
that
the
interstate
transportation
of
automobiles,
the
one
of
the
key
ways
in
which
gang
rings
are
caught.
the
dillinger
gang
and
others,
they
steal
cars
to
stay
in
business
and
this
is
the
way
the
federal
officials
get
control
over
this.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
we
think
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
right.
the
most
--
the
most
single
most
usual
situation
is
the
acts
of
larceny
of
taking
a
car
off
the
street.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
i
would
guess
next,
i
don't
know.
but
i
guess
from
what
i
happen
to
do
know
that
next
the
most
common
would
be
the
bad
check
acquisition
of
a
--
of
a
car
or
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
or
--
yes
or
--
well,
it
is
--
if
the
state
has
a
mortgage
or
has
title
interest
where
the
title
goes
across,
if
the
seller
reserves
the
title
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
they
are
both
crimes.
still
on
--
on
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
on
conditional
sales
of
the
automobile.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
the
--
no.
most
--
they
do
not
count
--
among
the
225,000
auto
thefts
last
year,
a
quarter
of
a
million
cars
reported
as
auto
theft,
90%
of
which
were
--were
recovered.
those
figures
do
not
include
cars
returned
or
cars
whether
it
appears
to
be
that
the
crime
reporting
manual
on
how
to
report
crimes
don't
report
it
unless
there's
an
intent
to
steal
the
car,
i
mean,
to
deprive
the
owner
of
it.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
this
is
not
--
do
not
include
cases
where
use
of
a
car
is
--
show
for
someone
with
lawful
possession
and
uses
the
car
illegally,
that's
not
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
yes,
show
for
it
going
on.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
he
sold
the
car
when
he
got
it.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
right.
this
is
--
if
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
there
are
number
of
these
cases.
there
are
three
or
four
among
the
cases
referred
to
in
the
briefs
or
just
this
--
this
thing
happened.
i'll
save
the
balance
--
moment
of
my
time.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
have
a
minute
or
two
left.
mr.
justice
black,
on
the
amendments
to
this
act,
none
of
them
were
voted
down.
two
of
the
various
amendments
proposed
passed
different
houses
but
died
in
the
rush
of
business.
most
of
them
included
other
minor
changes
in
the
act,
including
adding
tractors
and
things
of
that
kind,
although,
a
couple
were
limited
to
adding
the
word
"embezzlement".
i'd
like
to
cover
the
other
federal
statutes
so
we
can
see
that
most
times
in
most
of
the
theft
crimes,
congress
has
added
a
spring
of
words
together.
there
are,
however,
cases
such
as
in
18
u.s.c.
1710,
whoever
being
a
post
master
or
postal
service
employee
takes
or
steals
any
newspaper
packets
from
the
post
office
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
steals,
any
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
takes
or
steals
any
newspaper
or
packets
of
newspapers
from
the
post
office.
now,
under
common
law
definition,
you
would
--
a
post
master
would
hardly
be
stealing
things
from
the
embezzlement
of
materials
in
the
post
office
service.
the
vagueness
point
we
think
is
unimportant.
the
administrative
point
or
the
difficulty
of
administrating
a
statute
which
has
a
hard
time
deciding
whether
it
is
a
federal
offense
or
not
depending
upon
the
intent
of
the
individual
is
the
major
point
which
the
government
would
like
to
leave
with
you.
thank
you.
