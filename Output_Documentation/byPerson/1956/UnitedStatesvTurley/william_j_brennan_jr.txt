justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
tell
me
mr.
fisher,
this
indictment
says
that
this
accused
was
loaned
the
automobile
to
take
certain
people
to
their
homes
in
columbia,
south
carolina
and
that
he
--
after
with
--
after
having
done
that,
he
converted
the
car.
now,
i
gather
for
this
statute
to
be
applicable
at
all,
the
government
has
to
prove
a
theft
in
south
carolina,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
where
--
where
--
how's
the
government
going
to
prove?
and
i
think
this
bearer
is
out
of
the
construction
of
the
statute,
really.
how
do
you
prove
a
theft
in
south
carolina
under
circumstances
in
which
has
alleged,
he
was
loaned
the
car
for
use
within
columbia,
south
carolina?
now,
what
point
in
south
carolina
do
you
establish
there
was
a
theft
in
south
carolina
following
which
he
had
transported
the
car,
knowing
it
was
stolen
across
the
state
line?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
can't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
you
have
--
it
has
to.
you
have
to
establish
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
south
carolina.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it's
not
going
to
help
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
you
need
to
prove
he
rode
from
the
border
of
south
carolina
to
baltimore,
unless
you
also
establish
that
he'd
stolen
the
car
before
he
came
to
the
border.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
think
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
this
--
this
charges
him
with
having
stolen
it
because
it
then
goes
on
to
allege
that
he
had
convert
the
same
to
his
own
use
and
then
unlawfully
transport
it
from
columbia,
south
carolina
to
baltimore.
so,
you
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
do
you
prove
that?
that's
my
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
fact
then,
that
worries
me.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
fisher,
these
--
certainly,
the
number
of
convictions
or
prosecutions
based
on
circumstances
such
as
alleged
here,
where
there
was
a
bona
fide
borrowing
of
the
automobile
isn't
the
kind
of
thing
that
those
figures
looks
like,
is
it?
isn't
it
usually
where
perhaps
possession
is
gained
by
trick,
where
actually
it
may
establish
larceny
by
trick?
isn't
that
the
more
usual
situation
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
larceny
by
trick.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
most
of
them
these
days?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
in
this
situation,
usually,
the
prank
thing
of
some
youngster
borrowing
a
car
and
then
bringing
it
home?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
is
at
the
time
that
you
get
the
car
from
the
owner.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
a
case
on
a
frolic
in
his
own
service.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
--
that's
what
this
indictment
is,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
appreciate
that
but
i
mean
the
--
in
its
origin.
he
apparently
was
loaned
the
automobile
and
then
he
just
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
form
of
the
amendment,
do
you
know?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
general,
the
state
statutes
and
many
criminal
statutes
going
way
back
among
the
states
are
there
that
use
the
word
“stolen?”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
--
what
has
usually
been
the
interpretation
under
those
statutes?
