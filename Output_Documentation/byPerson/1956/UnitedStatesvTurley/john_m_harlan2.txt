was
all
before

taken
out
--

completely.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
a
split
in
the
circuits?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
would
you
think
the
fbi
would
resolve
that
ambiguity
in
any
case
that
they
thought
was
important?
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
there
any
figures
the
fbi
figured
as
to
the
amount
of
number
of
cars
that
are
transported
in
interstate
commerce
by
so-called
offenses,
people
who
receives
them
as
stolen
cars
who
don't
do
the
stealing
themselves?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
missed
the
significance
of
that
quotation
you
read
in
the
brooks
case.
