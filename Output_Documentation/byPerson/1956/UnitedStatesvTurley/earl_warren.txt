mr.
martin,
in
some
states
like
my
own,
california,
they
have
abolished
all
distinction
between
the
various
forms
of
larceny.
and
now,
whether
a
man
steals
an
automobile
by
--
by
plain
theft,
or
by
embezzlement,
false
pretenses,
or
by
trick
and
device
to
just
charge
him
with
--
with
theft
and
that
he
stole
an
automobile,
from
(a)
stolen
automobile,
from
(b)
and
that's
theft.

don't
know
how
many
states
have
that
but
wouldn't
that
bear
upon

perhaps
upon
--
but
why
not
