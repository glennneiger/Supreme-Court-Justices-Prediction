l.
black
may
i
suggest
up
to
this
point.
you're
--
you're
--
what
you're
arguing
here
is
when
you
say
that's
what
you
won't
decide.
your
complaint
charges
what
everyone
would
admit
was
embezzlement,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
well,
that's
one
of
your
general
meaning
of
it,
but
what
if
he
had
stolen
the
car
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it
certainly
means
embezzlement.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
say
that
we
should
construe
the
statute
which
says
stolen
as
including
that
embezzlement.
that's
further.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
might
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
might
not
be
inviting.
it
might
be
that
--
that
someone
would
say,
“well,
it
just
doesn't
mean
embezzlement
without
knowing
the
meaning.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
there
many
cases
outstanding?
many
cases
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
are
you
going
to
say?
excuse
me.
before
we
ask
you
one
section,
you
know
about
the
reference
you
made
to
the
government's
brief
as
a
report
from
the
senate
committee,
partially
quoted,
showing
if
there's
a
favorable
report
of
the
bill
to
include
embezzlement
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
not
said
that
word
to
the
act.
was
that
bill
voted
on
in
the
house
if
you
know
or
did
it
just
die
without
being
voted
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
report
in
the
senate
that
you
know?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
that
the
house
--
is
this
a
house
bill?
so,
that's
a
senate
report,
senate
report.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
there
are
some
house
reports
referred
to
also.
