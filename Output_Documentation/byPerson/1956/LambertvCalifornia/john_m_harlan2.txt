justice
john
m.
harlan
would
you
mind
stating
the
facts
that
give
rise
to
the
question
to
your
argument?
what
happened
here?
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
right,
on
your
own
way.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
say
the
statute
had
been
very
infrequently
used?
are
there
any
figures
on
it
how
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
many
people
have
been
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
tried
under
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
how
did
they
happen
to
arrest
this
woman?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
does
a
sentence
imposed
in
this
case
compare
with
sentences
in
other
cases?
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
doesn't
strike
you
as
an
unusually
heavy
sentence
of
the
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
long
is
this
statute
been
on
the
books?
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
of
what
time?
the
time
he
committed
it
or
as
of
the
present?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
could
i
ask
you
one
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
maybe
you
can
answer
it,
but
in
your
investigation
of
this,
how
do
they
operate
this
statute?
do
they
have
roundups
of
all
the
crooks
every
once
in
a
while
or
do
they
act
only
on
complaint?
how
does
it
work?
justice
john
m.
harlan
have
there
been
any
california
decisions
on
any
phase
of
this
ordinance
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
reported
--
reported
decisions
--
opinions
of
the
state
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
never
been
before
the
california
courts
in
any
respect?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
in
your
brief?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
case
or
did
you
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
got
the
citation
of
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
are
you
implying?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
are
you
implying?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understood
mr.
grey
to
say
that
that's
the
way
the
law
was
effectively
administered.
