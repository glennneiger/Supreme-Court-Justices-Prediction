mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
this
is
an
--
is
appeal,
substantially
an
attack
upon
the
validity
of
what
is
known
as
the
criminal
registration
ordinance.
specifically,
it
is
an
appeal
from
the
conviction
of
appellant
herein
and
from
her
--
from
the
sustaining
of
that
conviction
by
the
appellate
department
of
the
superior
court
of
the
county
of
los
angeles
for
failure
to
register
with
the
police
department
for
a
crime
which
she
had
been
convicted
four
years
before
the
date
of
her
arrest
which
led
to
this
case.
our
arguments,
we
based
upon
four
different
propositions.
first,
that
any
criminal
registration
ordinance
is
unconstitutional
and
that
it
violates
certain
fundamental
rights
of
american
citizenship,
which
we
will
elaborate
more
at
length.
second,
that
if
it
is
possible
to
concede
of
the
validity
in
the
abstract
of
a
criminal
registration
ordinance,
that
the
specific
ordinance
here
involved
is
unreasonable
and
violates
certain
fundamental
rights
of
citizenship.
third,
that
assuming
that
the
ordinance
is
not
on
its
phase
or
not
per
se
invalid
and
unconstitutional,
that
it
has
been
so
applied
that
under
the
rule
of
yick
wo
against
hopkins,
it
in
--
in
essence
and
in
procedural
and
in
fact
it
has
been
made
unconstitutional.
and
finally,
that
appellant
herein
was
denied
her
specific
case
of
the
benefits
of
many
constitutional
provisions.
now,
on
the
first
hand,
that
any
criminal
registration
is
invalid.
the
whole
essence
and
content,
and
purpose
of
the
criminal
registration
laws
is
to
require
that
a
person
who
had
served
his
or
her
sentence
or
time,
or
paid
the
penalty
of
a
crime
against
the
state
must
thereafter
register
with
the
police
or
sheriff
department
where
he
or
she
lives,
and
must
continue
to
inform
that
police
department
or
sheriff's
department
for
the
rest
of
his
or
her
natural
life
in
most
cases
of
any
change
of
address.
now,
this
we
submit
is
an
invasion
of
the
individual's
right
of
privacy,
the
right
of
freedom
of
locomotion,
the
right
to
be
left
alone.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
that
is
right,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
well,
in
the
case
of
the
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
in
the
case
of
the
municipal
code
section
52.39
appearing
on
page
33
of
our
brief,
we
submit
that
the
requirement
of
registration
at
all
is
unconstitutional
but
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
that
is
right.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
that
we
also
will
--
will
attack
certain
specific
sections
of
it
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
--
which
i
will
go
in
detail.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
it
would
be
under
the
general
code-making
power.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
in
my
opinion,
it
is
in
conflict
therewith.
the
california
penal
code
section
290
is
a
limited
registration
of
--
of
ex-convicts
and
--
and
is
known
as
the
sex
offender
registration,
and
i
will
point
out
the
differences
and
the
reasons
why
and
what
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
that
is
right.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
no,
i
believe
not,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
now,
i
might
as
a
background
before
going
into
my
argument,
i
might
state
that
this
is
a
case
of
first
impression.
there
is
no
opinion
in
any
report,
of
any
appellate
department,
of
anywhere
in
the
united
states
that
i
could
find
or
that
a
respondent
has
found
which
either
sustains
or
invalidates
this
particular
statute
or
ordinance.
the
only
appellate
department
which
to
my
knowledge
has
considered
it
is
the
--
our
own
appellate
department
in
the
county
of
los
angeles
and
its
opinion
in
these
cases
and
before
though
we
have
give
it
verbatim
in
--
in
our
appendix.
it
is
not
in
--
in
any
official
report.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
now,
i
have
planned
to
go
to
those
soon
as
i
get
back
at
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
--
if
the
court
--
if
you
please,
mr.
justice
harlan.
now
--
so
this
is
very
definitely
a
case
of
first
impression.
now,
the
--
the
highest
court
of
--
of
resort
in
state
of
california,
in
the
abstract
sense,
has
not
ruled
on
this
case.
the
supreme
court
has
not
ruled
on
it.
the
court
of
appeals
has
not.
under
california
law,
the
court
of
appeals
in
misdemeanor
matters,
the
highest
court
of
resort
in
the
state
is
what
is
the
trial
court
in
felony
matters
to
wit
the
superior
court,
which
has
an
appellate
department
and
which
had
the
last
word
in
the
--
this
case.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
that
would
be
--
that
is
it,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
we
came
immediately
here,
because
under
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
no.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
not
--
not
--
well,
not
after
the
appellate
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
--
department
of
the
superior
court.
we
have
one
appeal
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
it
has
none,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
and
--
and
that
was
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
--
the
point
i
was
giving
for
the
court's
knowledge
that
--
that
--
i
personally
think
that
whenever
a
constitutional
issue
is
raised
that
perhaps
the
highest
state
court
should
pass
on
that
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
--
before
we
come
here,
but
it
cannot
--
we
cannot
go
there
and
just
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
this
--
this
is
the
court
of
last
resort.
now,
the
--
also,
as
a
background
for
my
argument
and
before
going
to
the
facts
of
the
specific
case,
may
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
a
note
in
the
university
of
pennsylvania
law
review
upon
which
much
of
the
argument,
both
the
respondent
and
appellants
will
be
based.
i
have
cited
it
in
my
own
brief
of
--
it
has
been
a
source
of
leads,
the
arguments
and
the
facts,
i
think
of
both
sides
in
this
case
and
therefore
i
think
deserves
mentioning.
now,
sometime
before
the
year
1954,
the
jacob
kossman,
esquire,
the
philadelphia
bar
established
to
fund
in
memory
of
the
late
justice
wiley
rutledge.
and
out
of
that
fund,
research
was
made
by
the
university
of
pensylvanica
law
review
and
they
made
--
made
a
complete
analysis
nationwide
of
the
criminal
registration
ordinance.
and
i
will
refer
to
it
from
time
to
time
as
i
have
in
my
brief.
now
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
yes,
in
california
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
it
is,
your
honor,
because
it
is
--
the
state
takes
file
--
should
follow
jurisdiction
on
an
appeal
and
then
we
come
--
come
here
from
the
state's
--
file
an
opinion
from
the
state.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
perhaps
i
can
explain
it
to
--
to,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
we
have
here
a
--
what
is
in
california
court
in
a
probation,
which
is
not
a
judgment.
as
a
matter
of
definition,
she
was
given
probation
with
certain
terms
and
condition,
which
i
will
also
go
into.
and
--
and
there
stated
that
a
judgment
is
not
imposed
in
many
cases
when
probation
is
given,
it
may
be
later
imposed.
it
could
be
imposed
the
next
day
or
the
same
day,
but
the
point
is
that
you
can
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
probation
--
of
probation
because
in
a
sense,
it's
a
final
judgment.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
here
we
go.
now
--
so,
now,
the
criminal
registration
ordinance
i
think
unquestionably
is
an
invasion
of
--
of
the
person's
right
of
privacy,
the
right
to
be
left
alone,
except
when
necessary
in
the
--
in
the
general
public
good,
the
right
of
freedom
of
locomotion.
now,
although
there
had
been
no
case
that's
directly
in
point,
there
had
been
several
cases,
including
a
case
of
this
court,
which
drew
light
upon
the
position
which
i
take
herein.
and
i
will
call
the
court's
attention
to
several
of
those
cases.
one
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
well,
thank
--
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
i'll
present
the
facts
at
this
time.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'll
present
the
facts
at
this
time
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
--
and
i'm
sorry.
now,
the
facts
of
this
case
actually
began
in
1951
at
which
time
appellant
plead
guilty
to
two
counts
of
forgery
based
upon
a
single
arrest
and
was
given
a
probation,
serving
a
portion
of
her
time
in
the
county
jail
and
thereafter
under
supervision
of
the
probation
partner.
sometime
later,
her
attorney
took
her
back
to
court
and
asked
that
she'd
be
removed
from
supervisory
jurisdiction
on
probation
and
confined
in
jail
for
the
period
of
her
--
of
her
probation.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
it
occurred
in
the
superior
court
of
the
county
of
los
angeles.
and
her
attorney
--
she
wasn't
getting
along
with
the
probation
officer
apparently
and
her
attorney
took
her
back
and
asked
she'd
be
confined.
it
was
her
wish
to
be
confined
for
--
for
a
probationary
period,
the
california's
peculiar
rule,
providing
people
to
be
confined
for
all
the
part
of
your
probation.
usually,
you're
confined
for
part
and
then
under
supervision
for
another
part.
in
most
states
like
ohio,
where
i
originally
from
in
practice,
either
you
do
time
or
you
do
probation,
you
don't
do
both,
but
california
as
to
give
the
court
discretion
to
put
you
in
custody
for
a
portion
of
your
probation
as
security
effect.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
it
may
vary
anywhere
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
on
this
case,
i
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
well,
so
the
court
didn't
put
her
--
she's
been
--
then
returned
her
to
--
to
the
county
jail
for
a
period
of
six
months
and
--
and
indicated
thereafter
probation
would
expire
without
dismissal.
now,
under
california
law
again,
we
have
provision
where
if
a
person
completes
probation
without
having
--
have
a
violation
thereof
of
--
recognized
by
the
court,
that
probation
is
terminated
and
the
case
is
dismissed.
that
is
the
normal
course.
in
the
appellant's
case,
probation
was
terminated
without
dismissal,
which
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
they're
here
today,
had
it
been
dismissed
at
that
time
she
would
not
have
been
subject
to
this
ordinance.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
it
was
dismissed
without
termination
of
the
sentence.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
forgery.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
i
believe
it's
1
to
14
years,
maximum.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
yes,
she
plead
guilty.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
yes.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
yes,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
sure
they
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
i
am
not
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
i
think
that
possibly
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
well,
of
course
there
are
certain
disabilities
such
as
denial
of
voting
rights
as
i
understand,
and
which
are
--
are
ably
annotated
in
the
respondent's
brief
and
appendix
thereto.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
that
is
my
understanding.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
it
may
be
that
the
setting
aside
of
it
might
restore
that
this
is
--
this
question
i
haven't
gone
into.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
no,
we're
not.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
i'm
--
i'm
making
that
for
two,
mr.
justice
black.
now,
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
now
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
i'm
going
right
into
that
at
this
time.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
yes.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
she
was
denied
of
those
but
--
but
we're
not
appealing
from
that.
we
are
appealing
from
the
fact
that
she
had
to
register
with
the
police
department
as
a
consequence
thereof
and
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
no.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
i
want
to
get
the
background
because
it's
based
upon
the
conviction.
the
whole
law
is
based
from
this
conviction.
now
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
no,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
very
well,
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
chief
justice.
now,
after
having
a
probation,
this
--
that's
important
to
the
case.
in
fact,
it
wasn't
terminated
because
as
i
point
out
later,
the
fact
that
--
that
she
was
--
probation
was
terminated
without
dismissal
becomes
a
part
of
the
appeal
and
that's
why
i'm
going
into
that.
i
mean,
she
did
probation
in
jail
and
then
thereafter,
the
probation
was
terminated
without
dismissal
of
the
charges,
which
is
a
normal
course
in
--
under
california
proceedings.
that
a
person
would
no
longer
be
amenable
to
the
statute,
but
in
her
case,
in
that
specific
case,
she
was
specially
made
liable
to
register
with
the
police
department,
though
she
had
a
provision
without
a
--
without
having
them
violated.
but
now
--
thereafter,
she
was
dismissed
from
prison,
released
from
prison
in
1952.
and
three
years
later,
in
1955,
she
was
arrested.
she's
arrested
in
the
manner
which
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
here
by
a
police
officer
who
did
not
give
her
the
calls
of
the
arrest,
did
not
permit
her
counsel.
i
was
with
her
at
the
time
to
discuss
with
her
or
to
see
her,
took
her
to
the
police
station
that
we
point
out
in
--
in
our
facts,
examined
her
including
the
inner
parts
of
her
person.
apparently,
searching
for
narcotics,
though
there's
no
showing
that
he
had
any
information
relative
thereto,
found
her
in
no
violation
of
--
of
any
--
of
felony
or
misdemeanor,
checked
back
and
found
that
she
had
not
registered
for
the
crime
of
forgery,
which
she
has
been
convicted
of
four
years
before
and
therefore,
held
her
for
not
registering
as
an
ex-convict.
she
had
never
been
told
she
had
to
register
as
apparent
here
and
was
not
given
a
chance
to
register
an
alternative
to
being
arrested
and
--
and
booked
for
fingerprinting.
now,
she
was
convicted
of
that
offense
in
a
four-day
trial.
in
the
first
two
days
of
which,
the
court
and
i
argued
a
constitutional
law,
and
the
next
two
days,
we
had
the
--
the
trial.
from
the
demurrer
stage
on,
we
argued
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
which
requires
registration
for
reason
which
i
will
go
unto
as
soon
as
the
facts
are
--
are
completed.
and
second,
that
appellant
had
been
improperly
denied,
certain
of
her
constitutional
rights,
one
to
be
free
from
unreasonable
search
and
seizure,
which
is
now
the
california
law.
we
became
abreast
with
the
federal
rule
in
reference
to
our
reasonable
search
and
seizure
in
1955
by
the
famous
kahan
case,
which
is
substantially,
applies
the
rule
of
--
previous
with
the
federal
court,
which
may
not
admit
evidence
obtained
as
a
result
in
a
reasonable
search
and
seizure.
in
fact,
our
--
our
law
even
goes
a
little
further
out
of
the
kahan
case.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
we
have
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
well,
it's
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
well,
now,
i
think
i've
given
--
given
the
background
of
facts
of
the
arrest
and
how
--
how
it
happened
and
--
and
the
facts
she
was
convicted
of
the
crime,
the
failure
to
register
before
this
crime
of
forgery
four
years
before.
now,
therefore,
it
is
our
contention
that
the
ordinance
under
which
she
was
convicted
is
unconstitutional.
and
at
this
point,
i
wish
to
cite
several
cases,
which
are
--
which
are
closely
similar
to
that
from
the
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
the
ordinance
required
that
a
person
having
been
convicted
of
a
felony,
of
any
felony
and
certain
density
of
misdemeanors.
register
with
the
police
or
sheriff's
department
if
any,
whether
in
a
--
in
a
municipality
or
--
or
outside
of
one,
giving
his
or
her
name
and
address
and
also
revealing
all
prior
convictions
wherever
they
may
have
been
in
any
state,
anywhere,
the
nature
of
it,
how
long
they
serve,
what
--
what
--
all
prior
convictions.
essentially,
that
is
what
the
requirement
of
registration
is.
in
addition
to
that,
the
--
there's
a
big
section
of
the
ordinance,
such
other
and
further
information
as
may
be
required
by
the
chief
of
police
for
the
purpose
of
aiding
and
assisting
and
carrying
into
effect
the
provisions
and
intent
of
sections
52.38
to
52.43
inclusive.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
that's
right,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
she
was
convicted
by
a
jury
and
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
the
judge
thereafter
placed
her
upon
a
three
years
probation.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
that
is
right.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
that
is
right,
mr.
justice
black.
she
was
given
a
three-year
probation,
monetary
terms
of
which
was
a
$250
fine.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
that
is
one
of
her
challenges,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
$250.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
no.
she's
given
a
three
years
probation.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
upon
the
condition
that
she
pay
a
$250
fine
and
not
become
involved
with
the
law
in
any
matter
for
the
next
three
years.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
now,
and
if
i
may
go
back
to
that
point.
now,
one
of
the
reasons
why
this
case
has
never
been
appealed
before,
i
think,
is
that
it's
suggested
in
this
manner.
first,
this
law
has
very
little
use.
it's
used
and
only
isolate
incidents
which
in
itself
is
--
is
an
evidence
of
misapplication,
i
think,
and
of
discrimination.
second,
whereas
in
the
few
cases
where
it
has
been
used,
usually,
the
defendant
is
an
indigent
who
cannot
afford
even
to
pay
the
nominal
fine
which
is
given
and
--
or
second,
the
--
the
fine
is
so
small
that
--
that
there's
nothing
to
fight
about
in
--
in
a
sense
except
for
of
course
one's
reputation
and
one's
feeling
of
injury.
in
this
case,
fortunately
for
the
appellant,
she
was
employed
by
her
counsel
as
--
as
his
legal
secretary.
so,
the
money,
monetary
aspect
was
not
important.
second,
the
fact
that
she
was
given
such
a
severe
sentence
for
this
type
of
--
of
an
offense,
three
years
probation,
where
at
the
time
of
her
trial,
as
the
court
knew
she
had
not
been
convict
--
she
had
not
voluntarily
committed
any
crime
for
four
years,
not
just
with
forgery,
since
she
was
working
for
an
attorney
as
legal
secretary
going
to
school
at
night,
when
this
is
merely
a
technical
violation
of
ordinance
which
was
generally
unknown,
was
not
known
to
me
until
this
case
arose.
and
when
the
court,
knowing
all
this
thing
and
furthermore,
before
the
trial,
we
had
expunged
her
record,
so
that
it's
now
being
dismissed
and
set
aside
so
that
she
no
longer
would
have
to
register.
but
in
spite
of
all
those
things,
the
court
saw
fit
to
--
to
impose
a
three-year
probation,
one
of
the
conditions
thereof
was
a
payment
of
$250
fine
which
--
and
in
--
in
of
that
condition
that
the
defendant
meant,
no
probation
at
all
would
refrain
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
we
had
her
original
conviction
of
forgery
under
california
law
expunged
by
the
court,
which
had
terminated
without
--
without
expunging
the
record.
based
upon
what
had
happened
in
this
arrest
and
--
and
the
problems
she
was
faced
with
just
because
it
hadn't
been
expunged
previously,
so
that
she
just
very
technically
came
within
an
exception
to
the
exception.
in
other
words,
the
law
of
los
angeles
provides
that
all
ex-felons
must
register
except
those
whose
records
have
been
expunged.
because
the
court
had
failed
to
expunge
a
record
prior
to
her
arrest,
she
was
nominally
guilty
of
the
crime
and
was
convicted
thereof
in
--
in
the
matter
stated.
yet,
before
trial,
she
had
a
record
expunged,
so
the
court
could
not
even
make
as
a
condition
of
probation
that
she's
arrested
with
the
police
department
because
she
no
longer
--
she
no
longer
by
the
time
of
trial
a
month
after
the
arrest
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
have
been
expunged
and
dismissed,
but
not
at
the
time
of
the
arrest.

mr.

mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
that
is
right.
it
appears
in
the
facts.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
the
court's
position
was
that
at
the
time
of
her
arrest
which
proves
she
had
not
had
her
record
expunged.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
that
is
right.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
not
at
that
time.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
that
is
right,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
that
is
right,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
that
is
one
of
the
issues,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
and
one
of
the
issues
of
this
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
well,
i
think
that
--
and
i
would've
argued
later
that
as
reference
to
the
specific
facts
that
applied
to
appellant
in
this
case.
that
under
california
law
we
had
a
right
to
have
a
record
expunged
at
the
termination
of
probation.
that's
a
right
stated
in
section
1203.4,
also
in
the
--
in
the
appendix.
the
statute
says
that
a
termination
of
probation
without
violation
the
court
must
dismiss
the
case.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
that
is
state
law
but
our
position
is
that
a
failure
to
apply
that,
which
was
settled
state
law
to
the
appellant
on
this
case,
was
a
denial
of
the
protection
of
the
law.
and
--
and
because
of
that
failure
to
apply
to
her
and
the
denial
of
that
protection,
she
was
therefore
exposed
to
this
later
arrest
and
conviction
of
--
even
though
she
had
done
a
probation
and
without
violation,
it
should
have
had
the
record
expunged
and
the
conviction
set
aside.
that's
one
of
the
number
of
contentions
that
we
make
here.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
that
is
right
and
the
--
and
the
court
of
appeals
also,
as
part
of
my
brief,
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
to
the
appellate
department
of
the
superior
court.
that
is
--
that
is
the
court
of
the
appeals
in
this
case,
the
appellate
department
of
the
superior
court.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
that
is
right,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
i
think
that
is
right,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
may
i
say
this,
mr.
justice
whittaker?
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
that
in
normal
course
under
california
procedure,
the
minute
probation
is
terminated,
the
probation
department
makes
the
motion
for
the
--
for
the
probation.
this
is
normal
california
procedure
because
these
are
--
otherwise,
the
court
himself
where
there's
no
probation
involved,
the
court
himself
will
make
the
order.
but
in
this
case,
the
court
made
a
specific
order
that
the
record
not
be
expunged
and
that
is
a
crux
in
my
argument
here.
we
have
a
specific
order
which
to
me
was
not
a
lawful
order
and
there
has
never
been
an
order
in
my
experience
or
--
or
knowledge
that
a
record
not
be
expunged,
specifically,
that
we
will
not
expunge
this
record
without
dismissal
except
in
this
case,
which
put
her
an
exception
to
the
exception.
in
other
words,
the
exception
is
you
do
your
probation,
you
don't
have
to
register.
but
the
court
said,
“though
you've
done
your
probation,
we
are
not
going
to
dismiss
the
record.”
specifically
said
that
and
i
submit
that
that
was
a
violation
of
--
of
california
law
in
such
a
manner
that
it
exposed
her
to
a
conviction
of
a
crime
which
she
had
no
knowledge
or
intent
to
commit,
as
we'll
go
on
to
later.
and
was
a
--
and
was
a
denial
of
equal
application
of
the
law
because
the
court
did
not
take
any
affirmative
action
at
all.
whatever
affirmative
action
the
court
took,
it
should
have
been
to
dismiss
rather
than
to
order
that
it
not
be
dismissed.but
that
is
just
one
of
our
number
of
points,
not
the
most
fundamental
one
but
i
hope
i've
made
myself
clear
that
i
think
the
court
was
entirely
--
not
just
in
error
but
with
failure
to
apply
the
law
equally,
because
probationers
is
not
quite
automatic.but
as
a
manner
of
california
practice,
the
probation
officer
will
go
to
the
court
and
say,
“your
honor,
this
person
has
not
been
violated,
will
you
set
aside
the
record?”
and
this
court
case,
the
court
said,
“when
you
get
out
of
jail,
you
will
not
be
--
have
a
case
dismissed,”
without
dismissal
with
the
words
used
in
--
in
the
record
here.
so
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
if
that
were
the
case,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
but
it
wasn't.
it
didn't
happen
that
way.
the
court
continued
her
in
probation.
that
is
under
the
california
law.
you
can
stay
in
jail
for
your
probationary
period.
and
that
was
her
request
to
her
attorney
which
is
a
matter
of
record
here
that
--
that
i
spend
the
rest
of
my
time
in
probation
and
because
the
court
said
that
at
the
time
of
your
--
the
--
the
release
from
--
from
probation
from
jail,
the
probation
shall
bear.
that
shall
then
bear
in
spite
at
that
time
without
dismissal.
it
was
not
a
matter
of
being
violated
and
doing
time
rather
than
do
probation
but
the
question
of
during
your
probation
in
custody
rather
than
--
than
perhaps
take
a
chance
on
running
above
the
law
in
the
street,
so
you
don't
have
a
job
and
you
go
to
the
court
and
say,
“your
honor,
i
don't
have
a
job.
i
know
i'll
be
put
in
jail
for
violation.
may
i
serve
my
time
in
custody?”
and
the
court
would
not
there
--
therefore
hold
you,
no
longer
probation
because
you
haven't
done
anything.
it's
just
a
matter
of
going
to
the
court
and
say,
“your
honor,
i'd
rather
do
my
probation.”
normally,
the
lawyers
argue,
“your
honor,
may
we
have
straight
time
and
no
time
in
jail
on
probation?”
in
this
case,
the
lawyer
argued
the
other
way
that
she'd
be
better
off
doing
her
probation
in
jail.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
well,
because
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
well,
in
the
first
place,
she
wasn't
able
to
get
--
get
a
job
because
she
was
--
she
was
a
convicted
person.
she
was
having
a
great
deal
of
difficulty.
her
probation
officer
was
--
was
threatening
all
kind
of
things.
well,
she
said,
“i'm
going
to
straight
to
the
court
and
ask
him
to
take
me
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
rather
than
improvised
probation.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
at
least
that
and
no
violation
of
law.
that
--
but
she
specifically
asked
to
be
--
to
do
her
--
whatever
time
she
had
on
probation,
to
do
that
in
custody.
and
the
court
along
with
her
attorney's
suggestion
and
confine
her
to
jail
for
the
--
for
the
duration
of
her
probation,
not
in
lieu
of
probation.
and
that
i
think
is
important
that
she
therefore
should
have
had
the
record
set
aside
and
not
the
order
without
dismissal
as
it
appears
on
the
record
here.
i'd
like
to
go,
however,
into
my
contention
that
this
specific
ordinance
is
unreasonable,
but
first,
as
to
the
general
unreasonableness
of
any
criminal
registration
ordinance.
let
me
point
out
that
this
particular
law
was
panic
legislation.
it
was
--
as
stated
very
ably
in
the
brief
of
respondent
which
is
quoted
from
this
--
from
the
registration
ordinance
of
--
in
the
university
of
pennsylvania
law
review
and
i
think
it
appears
on
page
3
as
i
recall
it
of
respondent's
brief
--
sorry,
page
19.
the
historical
background
and
basis
for
legislation
require
the
registration
of
ex-convicts.
it
is
pointed
out
here
that
this
legislation
had
its
foundation
in
--
in
a
law
in
the
early
1930s
with
reference
to
criminal
--
professional
criminality.
and
this
was
one
of
the
results,
the
registration
ordinance.
now,
in
the
criminal
registration
ordinance
note
from
which
this
background
is
taken,
in
a
portion
which
is
omitted,
it
--
it
also
points
out
that
the
gangster
laws
are
also
the
result
of
this
period,
of
--
of
frustration
and
alarm,
and
ended
up
--
a
few
of
the
laws
which
were
passed,
punish
a
person
just
for
being
criminals.
and
--
and
the
new
jersey
law,
which
was
set
aside
i
believe
by
this
court
of
--
of
the
gangster
statute
from
new
jersey.
well,
lanzetta
against
new
jersey,
306
u.s.451
was
in
that
category.
a
similar
law
in
michigan
was
held
unconstitutional.
these
were
the
gangster
laws,
which
drew
out
of
this
period
of
concern
and
alarm
about
an
alleged
rise
in
criminality
of
this
period.
actually,
this
note
on
the
criminal
registration
ordinance
questions
the
factual
background
of
that
because
it's
pointed
out
that
actually,
there
was
a
decrease
in
criminality
according
to
criminological
figures,
but
that
is
not
important
to
our
consideration.
the
fact
is
we
have
two
types
of
law
they
drew
out
of
the
concern
in
--
during
1930s.
one,
were
the
gangster
laws,
which
have
been
declared
unconstitutional.
the
other
were
criminal
registration
laws.
may
i
also
point
out
that
only
five
states
have
adopted
our
state's,
the
criminal
registration
law,
california
being
one,
new
jersey,
illinois,
florida
and
illinois.
only
47
municipalities
have
adopted
this
type
of
thing.
the
only
major
city
other
than
los
angeles
is
philadelphia
that
has
adopted
criminal
registration
ordinance,
the
other
not
having
found
it
necessary
are
useful.
washington
does
not
have
one,
new
york,
chicago,
nor
of
a
major
city
have
this
type
of
ordinance,
except
for
philadelphia
and
los
angeles.
and
this
i
think
is
maybe
considered
the
standpoint
of
how
necessary
or
even
how
reasonable
it
may
be.
it's
not
a
final
determination
i
think
it
may
be
considered.
it
has
not
been
found
necessary
generally
in
the
united
states
to
adopt
this
sort
of
invasion
into
an
--
it
ended
the
--
the
privately
entered
verdict
has
completely
served
the
sentence.
and
for
the
rest
of
his
or
her
natural
life,
you
must
report
to
the
police
department,
exposing
yourself
inherently
to
rouse
the
arrest
and
that's
--
and
the
sort
of
thing
to
which
police
departments
are
so
capable.
recently,
california
has
found
it
necessary
to
adopt
the
(inaudible)
case
rule
to
stop
police
intrusion
into
individual
privacy,
as
the
federal
court
did
some
time
ago
in
its
law
against
a
reasonable
search
and
seizure.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
that
is
right.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
that
is
right,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
well,
from
the
standpoint
of
unreasonable
search
and
seizure,
which
i'm
bringing
up
now.
general
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
i
have
found
none.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
well,
i
have
found
no
light
in
that
direction,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
and
now,
in
that
particular
point,
but
the
point
i'm
getting
at
here
is
that
this
type
of
ordinance
is
inherently
abusing
and
that
it
permits
and
encourages
police
intrusion
in
--
into
privacy
of
people's
--
of
lives
after
they
completely
served
a
sentence.
now,
this
is
distinguishable.
for
instance,
from
the
denial
of
the
right
of
the
privilege
of
voting,
because
voting
is
a
privilege,
not
a
right
and
--
and
that
vote
is
sometimes
taken
away.
in
fact,
generally
is
taken
away
i
think
because
of
conviction
of
a
felony.
but
in
this
case,
a
person
is
required
to
be
in
constant
touch
with
the
police
for
the
rest
of
their
life,
that
all
times
their
whereabouts
must
be
known.
this
is
a
restriction
upon
complete
freedom
of
locomotion.
it
is
an
invasion
of
their
privacy.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
it's
2.39,
mr.
justice
black,
which
we're
attacking
here.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
because
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
well,
the
--
there
another
section
requires
that
thereafter
--
before
every
change
of
address,
and
that
is
section
52.40
which
--
which
because
it's
immediately
involved.
once
she's
registered
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
the
point
is
made
in
my
brief
but
the
ordinance
itself
is
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
it
--
it's
in
the
brief
of
the
respondent.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
on
page
5.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
of
--
of
the
--
of
appellee's
brief,
under
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
of
the
--
of
the
appendix,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
mr.
justice
douglas,
yes,
page
5
of
the
appendix.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
that
is
right,
which
requires
a
lifetime
notification
of
change
of
address.
a
person
convicted
of
a
crime
at
the
age
of
21
and
this
girl
was
--
will
therefore
have
to
--
have
to
report
to
the
police,
the
rest
of
her
natural
life,
wherever
they're
living.
so,
they
can
therefore
be
immediately
available
whenever
a
crime
is
committed
in
the
area
of
the
--
that
is
thought
they
might
commit.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
it's
an
unlimited
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
--
and
it
says,
“shall
within
48
hours
after
each
change
of
each
such
change,
whenever
the
convicted
person
changes
his
residence,”
and
there's
a
question
here
that
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
only
upon
the
--
well,
of
--
actually,
a
person's
record
has
been
--
has
been
expunged.
it's
the
only
--
it's
the
only
exception
to
the
rule.
but
according
in
california,
this
case
took
position
that
they
did
not
have
to
expunge
the
record
of
this
particular
party
and
it
was
only
by
the
mercy
of
the
court
based
upon
following
this
arrest.
now,
she's
able
to
avail
upon
the
court
to
dismiss
her
record
because
she
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
they
must
register
for
life.
i
follow
that
point,
but
i
didn't
raise
it
because
it
did
not
apply
directly
to
--
to
the
appellant
here.
but
because
--
well,
i
wonder
we're
the
only
state
i
know
of
that
has
this
--
or
the
--
the
one
or
two
that
have
this
dismissal
provision.
any
person
coming
in
the
--
coming
into
los
angeles,
many
of
the
state
must
register
for
the
rest
of
natural
life.
any
person
who
does
not
have
probation
in
california
must
register
for
the
rest
of
natural
life
before
any
change
of
address.
and
not
only
that,
not
just
the
reporting
but
you've
got
to
give,
and
this
is
important,
for
our
purposes
here.
you've
got
to
reveal
all
your
past
convictions
of
any
felony,
any
place
whatsoever,
and
under
california's
habitual
criminal
statute,
which
i
--
which
i
have
on
my
appendix
here.
since
habitual
criminality
increases
the
penalty,
my
position
is
that
you
--
you
are
required
by
this
ordinance
to
expose
whatever
habitual
criminality
you
may
have
and
thereby
you're
making
admissions,
giving
leads,
giving
evidence
as
to
habitual
criminality
and
you
thereby
required
to
--
to
incriminate
yourself
by
this
particular
ordinance.
now,
in
other
words,
you
don't
merely
register
and
report,
you
also
reveal
your
entire
criminal
background,
making
it
possible
to
prosecute
you
as
a
habitual
criminal.
that
is
one
thing
for
government
to
learn,
through
fbi
records
or
otherwise
of
one's
habitual
criminality.
it's
quite
--
another
thing
to
say,
“you
must
submit
here
in
writing
that
you
are
a
habitual
criminal.
you've
got
admissions
here
in
writing
of
habitual
criminality.”
you're
requiring
a
person
to
prosecute
himself
because
you
have
admissions
and
leads.
if
i
make
you
one
example
of
a
case
which
i
defended
of
--
a
case
i
defended
in
which
a
man
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
yes.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
only.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
that
is
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
that
is
right.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
that
is
--
that
is
right,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
also
point
out
that
since
the
court
have
ordered
that
she
not
be
expunged,
that
she
therefore
came
in
the
other
category,
because
it's
only
by
a
special
dispensation
of
mercy
that
we
were
--
we're
removed
from
being
the
exception
to
the
--
exception
that
does
not
have
to
register.
at
the
time
of
her
arrest,
we
have
--
were
just
what
we've
only
done
parole
rather
than
probation.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
i
believe
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
in
my
opinion,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
use
of
the
word
“shall”
in
this
ordinance
which
we
have
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
my
view
is
the
court
has
no
discretion
because
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
--
of
the
word
“shall”
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
in
other
words,
he's
--
he's
there
as
an
administrative
officer
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
--
to
find
the
facts,
if
the
fact
that
this
person
have
had
probation
and
done
it
without
having
it
violated.
therefore,
if
that
is
the
fact,
then
they
must
dismiss
the
case.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
there
had
been
no
decision
on
that
but
there
has
been
no
decision
contrary
and
--
and
the
clear
language
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
the
action
has
been,
but
the
clear
language
of
the
statute
is
that
when
it
is
found
that
a
party
has
--
have
probation
that
was
not
completed
for
a
period
of
probation,
then
the
court
shall
dismiss
it
upon
motion
therefore.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
and
this
case,
the
court
prevented
such
a
motion
by
saying,
you
shall
not
be
dismissed.
now,
i
think
that
the
--
the
standpoint
of
having
to
reveal
all
evidence
of
past
criminality
is
one
of
the
things
which
makes
this
particular
ordinance
unconstitutionally,
even
if
you
would
say
that
perhaps
some
criminal
registration
statutes
might
be
reasonable.
now,
i
--
i
further
think
that
in
order
to
be
reasonable,
the
primary
registration
as
it
is
an
invasion
of
--
of
american
citizenship's
--
citizenship
privileges
as
i
see
it.
i
think
it
should
be
limited
to
a
field
of
persons
who
have
demonstrated
perhaps
their
recidivism.
i
mean
one
who
was
over
--
just
like
we
have
our
--
our
habitual
criminal
statute.
i
think
if
a
person
had
proved
himself
a
habitual
criminal,
perhaps
to
require
such
a
person
to
register
might
be
--
might
be
reasonable.
even
there,
i'd
have
certain
misgivings
because
the
requirement
that
you
facilitate
your
own
prosecution
by
letting
the
police
know
in
advance
where
you
are,
to
me
is
almost
the
same
as
saying
to
a
man
who
commits
a
burglary
or
any
other
crime.
if
you
don't
leave
your
calling
card,
you
could
--
you're
guilty
of
another
separate
offense.
here
we
are
requiring
a
person
to
leave
a
calling
card
in
advance
so
the
cops
can
find
him
the
minute
they
want
to
for
whatever
they
want
them,
whether
they're
right
or
wrong
and
rouse
the
arrest,
dragnet
rage
have
resulted
from
this
type
of
ordinance.
as
it's
so
ably
pointed
out
in
the
university
of
pennsylvania
law
review
note,
that
has
been
the
inherent
result
and
in
fact
i
think
it
was
the
intention
of
--
and
certainly,
it
had
been
the
inherent
result
of
an
ordinance
which
permits
this
--
this
invasion
in
the
privacy
of
people
who
want
to
be
decent
citizens,
who've
done
their
time,
realized
their
mistakes,
as
in
this
case
of
appellant
here.
four
years
later,
she's
going
to
school
at
night.she's
a
legal
secretary.
she's
forgotten
her
criminal
past.
and
there,
--
here,
we
have
her
now,
you're
a
criminal
because
you
haven't
registered
and
let
us
know
where
you
are
and
she
wasn't
given
notice.
now,
that
is
another
point.
i
think
this
ordinance
is
unreasonable.
the
california
section
2
--
california
for
the
penal
code
section
290,
sorry,
of
the
sex
offender
registration
was
passed
in
1947.
at
that
time,
it
had
no
provision
of
notice
to
the
intended
registrants
and
didn't
work.
it
was
unreasonable.
it
couldn't
possibly
work
because
no
one
knew
they
had
to
register
because
no
court
or
no
probation
officer
told
them,
no
warden
in
a
penitentiary
told
them.
in
1950,
the
legislation
amended
our
california
section
290,
to
make
it
much
more
readable
and
that
it
provides
now
that
every
person
who
the
state
wants
to
register
must
be
informed
in
writing
and
must
sign
that
they
have
that
information,
that
--
that
we
know
we
must
register.
now,
there
--
there
--
it
seems
to
me
that
a
crime
of
omission
such
as
this,
due
process
requires
prior
notice
and
i
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
in
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
well,
now
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
in
this
--
this
law
review
note
which
i
keep
mentioning
has
indicated
only
10%
of
the
criminal's
generate
where
this
law
is
applicable
have
registered,
only
10%.
and
as
--
as
--
and
finally,
i
quote
from
a
solicitor
general
of
canton,
ohio,
one
of
the
cities
where
it
is
--
we
have
one
before
the
seven
cities
having
ordinance.
we
made
two
arrests
over
a
period
of
two
years
relating
to
failure
to
register.
you
see,
what
happens
is
this,
there
is
no
direct
effort
made
to
enforce
the
law.
it
only
comes
into
play
when
you're
arrested
for
something
else
and
it
is
therefore
found
you
have
not
registered.
i
--
i've
never
noticed
a
situation
where
the
police
would
go
down
the
record
and
say,
“here's
an
ex-convict
who
haven't
registered.”
let's
go
out
and
arrest
him
or
make
him
register.
it's
only
when
you're
arrested
for
some
other
cause.
and
for
that
reason,
the
law
is
also
unreasonable
and
that
those
who
want
to
be
law
abiding
will
register.
those
who
didn't
want
to
--
want
to
be
law
abiding
will
not
register
because
the
law
does
not
come
into
play
until
they're
arrested
to
say
with
some
subsequent
offense.
therefore,
it
served
no
valid
purpose.
it
just
interfered
with
the
private
lives
of
people
who
want
to
be
a
law
abiding
citizens,
because
if
they
can't
make
registry,
except
while
you're
on
probation.
therefore,
those
who
wish
to
violate
the
law
will
not
register
and
--
and
no
one
goes
out
to
find
to
make
him
register.
it's
only
if
you
get
arrested
for
robbery,
or
burglary,
or
bookmaking
or
something
like
that,
then
you'll
say,
“uh-huh,
you
haven't
registered.”
so,
that's
another
separate
offense
which
does
not
increase
your
time
because
--
because
you've
been
convicted
in
the
other
county.
anyhow,
when
a
person
like
this,
like
our
appellant
here
who
would
--
who
have
gone
--
who
had
been
rehabilitated,
would
go
and
register
because
they
don't
want
to
violate
the
law
and
do
not
intend,
do
not
--
in
a
sense
have
nothing
to
hide.
so
--
and
yet,
whenever
a
crime
is
committed
in
the
category
to
be
or
expected
to
commit,
they'll
be
exposed
to
dragnet
rage,
dragnet
arrest
which
has
happened.
that
has
been
the
result,
the
adherent
result
of
this
type
of
ordinance
wherever
it
has
been.
and
in
fact,
if
i
may
quote
again
the
--
from
--
from
this
note
that
“that
is
one
of
the
purposes
which
would
either
was
had
in
mind
or
which
the
police
recognized
as
a
valuable
ordinance
like
this,”
referring
to
the
adoption
of
the
los
angeles,
california
ordinance.
it
was
reported
that
district
attorney
berne
fitz
and
robert
b.stewart,
chief
deputy
district
attorney
who
affirmed
the
legislation,
and
chief
of
police
james
davis,
one
of
its
chief
supporters,
declare
that
the
very
fact
that
dangerous
ex-convicts
will
not
register
is
the
strength
of
the
law.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
it
was
one
of
the
--
a
false
arrest,
i
was
there
as
the
case
indicates.
she's
working
out
--
driving
downtown
to
work.
we
stopped
to
make
two
telephone
calls.
on
the
way
back
to
my
car
(inaudible)
the
law
library,
a
policeman
standing
in
the
corner
stopped
her
and
just
started
searching
her,
rolled
up
her
sleeve,
looking
for
narcotic
marks.
no
indication
of
why
they
did
it
because
the
girl
certainly
was
not
using
narcotics
and
he
searched
her
purse
right
there
in
the
street
corner.
she
said,
“what's
wrong?”
i'm
right
there.
i
said,
“officer,
what's
goes
on
here?”
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
now,
may
i
answer
to
the
best
of
my
ability
the
last
question
presented
was
why
was
she
arrested.
i
have
two
theories
because
one,
there
is
the
type
of
arrest
where
they
simply
a
false
arrest
in
which
a
police
officer
just
stopped
anybody
they
have
the
faintest
suspicion,
it
might
be
dope
users,
something
like
that.
then
you
--
they
arrest
you,
search
you,
check
your
arms.
if
you've
got
them,
it
marks
the
person
you
arrest.
recently,
one
of
the
few
and
we
spoke
with
the
facts
in
--
in
california,
particularly
certain
neighborhoods.
they
may
be
minority
neighborhoods
or
they
may
be
the
skid
row
neighborhood,
but
there
are
neighborhoods
where
you
simply
have
false
arrest.
my
second
theory
is
the
officer
may
have
mistaken
her
for
someone
else.
but
neither
event
she
wasn't
who
he
thought
she
was
and
--
and
upon
finding
no
present
violation
of
crime
they
held
her
for
not
having
arrested
for
crimes
she
committed
four
years
ago
of
which
she
had
no
notice
or
duty
to
register.
and
now,
i
repeat
that
i
think
that
in
orders
like
this
to
be
reasonable,
to
be
constitutional,
must
keep
notice
as
on
section
290
of
our
penal
code,
which
requires
that
a
person
--
the
court
could
--
puts
him
on
probation
or
the
--
or
the
probation
officer
when
the
--
or
the
warden
or
some
--
and
some
--
or
to
somebody
to
have
him
sign
in
writing
or
have
been
told
that
i
must
register.
then
of
course
if
they
commit
the
crime
they
have
had
some
prior
knowledge.
this
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
in
which
i
think
mens
rea
may
be
dispensed
with.
i
think
taken
the
kahriger
case
from
this
court,
on
the
registration
of
--
of
gamblers
as
an
example
in
which
this
court
went
even
further.
and
here,
a
person
who
knew
he
had
a
duty
to
register,
but
did
not
do
so
because
he
thought
that
was
unconstitutional
to
require
him
to
register,
was
held
to
be
not
violative
of
the
statute
because
in
here
we
don't
even
have
a
notice
to
register.
and
the
other
person
was
held
guilty
of
failing
to
do
what
he's
--
have
never
been
told
they
had
to
do,
which
you
couldn't
learn
in
due
course,
in
normal
course
that
you
had
to
do.
it's
not
like
selling
meat
or
driving
a
car
where
you
have
an
affirmative
act
about
which
you
can
get
advice
or
have
you
inspect
those
meat.
here
is
an
act,
a
big
thing
to
abstract
which
you
ought
to
know
you
have
to
do.
and
how
many
are
faced
before
that
category
which
no
one
has
any
notice.
i
think
that
notice
in
this
type
of
ordinance
as
--
and
it
isn't
all
federal
ordinance
of
the
type
where
they
got
hold
a
person
for
violation
of
an
ordinance
to
do
something
or
law
to
do
something.
and
same
thing
was
said
in
the
kahriger
case
on
the
gamblers
registration
law.
now,
it
is
also
my
point
that
the
law
requires
self-incrimination.
we
have
in
california
case,
i
cite
on
page
14
of
my
brief,
people
against
mccormick
which
held
that
the
law
requiring
communist
to
register
was
unconstitutional
because
it
was
self-incriminating.
and
we
submit
for
reasons
pointed
out
here,
i
won't
take
too
much
time
because
my
time
is
expiring.
the
reason
pointed
out
in
the
brief,
we
submit,
that
this
ordinance
is
in
the
same
category.
particularly,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
we
have
to
reveal
past
criminality
and
that
california
has
a
statute
on
habitual
criminality
which
you
must
reveal
under
this
particular
law.
and
the
mccormick
case
if
applied
equally
to
ms.lambert
would
have
--
would
have
outbid
this
--
this
conviction.
now,
as
i
was
saying
this
--
this
law
is
unreasonable
and
that
it
is
not
applied
and
that
no
one
registered.
only
10%
has
registered
and
most
of
them
have
no
notice,
except
those
who
have
registered
and
the
ones
who
have
notice
under
290
penal
codes.
very
few
register
as
felons
generally.
so
--
so
the
law
serves
no
purpose.
in
fact,
this
is
conceded
by
the
appellee
when
he
states
that
well,
it
doesn't
do
any
harm
because
we're
going
to
find
out
through
the
fbi
records
anyhow.
but
then
i
submit
let's
rely
on
the
fbi
records
and
not
invade
the
privacy
of
people
who
--
who
have
served
their
time
and
want
to
be
decent
citizens
again.
let's
rely
upon
the
fbi
records
and
not
upon
self-incrimination.
now,
the
appellee
in
--
in
their
brief
measured
many
other
types
of
registration
which
have
been
held
valid.
may
i
submit
that
every
type
mentioned
here
does
not
fall
in
the
category
of
criminal
registration.
they
are
not
with
reference
to
crime.
in
criminal
matters,
we
have
special
constitutional
protection
which
do
not
apply
to
registration
of
lobbyist,
registration
of
other
type
of
employees
or
participant
employees.
these
are
not
criminals
as
such.
they
are
people
simply
who
were
--
must
be
regulated
and
therefore
must
register.
no
amount
of
criminal
prosecution
or
attempt
to
prosecute
or
salutation
of
ones
own
prosecution
nor
as
self-incrimination.
i
submit
that
the
statute
is
too
vague.
in
the
first
place,
it
requires
a
person
to
interpret
the
--
the
california
distinction
between
felonies
and
misdemeanors,
since
it
applies
to
felons
only.
and
second
--
and
this
is
a
very
difficulty
thing
for
the
courts
to
do.
and
second,
it
permits
the
police
chief
to
write
in
certain
things
under
--
under
i
think
section
10
of
the
--
of
the
ordinance.
police
chief
may
--
may
require
anything
else
he
desires
as
far
as
registration
is
concerned.
and
i
submit
that
the
catchall
phrase
such
as
that
may
be
appropriate
to
constitution
as
giving
legislative
power.
but
in
this
case,
you
give
legislative
power
to
chief
of
police
that
that
in
itself
is
unconstitutional
due
to
the
vagueness
of
the
ordinance.
i
submit
further
that
this
is
unreasonable
and
that
it
--
and
that
--
that
real
--
the
people
who
should
register
will
not
--
the
only
innocent
people
who
did
not
intend
to
commit
a
crime
again
will
register.
so
it
has
--
so
it
does
not
serve
the
purpose
for
which
it
is
intended,
though
it
is
an
invasion
upon
privacy
of
the
individual.
and
now,
just
a
minute
on
the
--
i
submit
that
ms.lambert
was
denied
procedural
due
process
first,
by
failure
to
expunge
a
record
with
which
she
had
a
right
to.
second,
by
the
false
arrest
as
outlined
in
our
brief,
there
was
certainly
a
false
arrest
without
a
warrant,
without
a
statement
of
reason
or
fact
of
arrest,
without
permitting
me
to
talk
to
her
and
that
she
was
only
charged
with
crime
to
protect
this
false
arrest.
it
is
our
reason
why
this
crime
was
only
brought
nicely
as
to
--
was
brought
in
this
case
to
protect
the
false
arrest.
and
the
purpose
of
our
law
is
not
to
justify
police
officers,
make
things
easy
before
them.
our
basic
value
to
democracy
is
not
the
facilitation
of
prosecution
or
protection
of
police
officers
from
false
arrest.
now,
i
think
their
sentence
was
unreasonable
and
that
trial
court
indicated
throughout
the
trial
such
practice
against
her
as
to
deny
her
due
process.
particularly
--
and
arbitrate
some
of
the
transcript
on
appeal
and
in
the
failure
of
the
appellate
court
to
give
her
as
she
requested
the
verbatim
report
of
the
trial
under
the
forma
pauperis
provision
which
had
been
legislated
during
the
pendency
of
these
proceedings.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
i
think
i
have
one
or
two
minutes
to
finally
and
briefly
answer
with
two
contentions.
starting
with
the
last
contention
made,
we
submit
that
the
calling
these
orders
unconstitutional
would
not
affect
all
the
others,
some
are
more
recently
drawn.
section
290,
we've
point
out
the
distinction
of
section
290,
notice
is
given
to
the
best
extent
possible
to
--
potential
to
register.
and
this
ordinance
none
whatsoever
to
any
register.
now,
point
was
made
that
because
we
took
four
days
in
court,
the
judge
would
justify.
i
hope
we
haven't
reached
the
point
on
our
jurisprudence
for
a
person
who
did
not
have
all
the
time
in
court
required
by
the
facts
of
the
case.
for
two
days,
the
judge
and
i
argued
constitutional
law
and
not
the
facts
of
the
case.
we
submitted
the
facts
of
the
case
in
about
five
minutes.
for
two
days,
the
judge
had
to
borrow
--
get
law
books
just
to
understand
the
cases
i
was
reading.
now,
is
the
--
if
the
power
to
be
had
--
that
they
suffered
the
burden
of
that
and
just
to
(inaudible).
i
have
no
doubt
in
my
mind
because
thereafter
the
court
if
we
don't
pay
--
if
we
don't
pay
the
250,
you
get
six
months
in
jail.
although,
at
the
time
of
the
trial
was
even
required
to
register.
there's
no
doubt
in
my
mind
whatsoever
she
gets
six
months
in
jail.
now
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
mr.
justice
whittaker
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
mr.
justice
whittaker,
if
she
doesn't
pay
that
$250,
she'd
go
to
jail
tomorrow.
it's
imposed
now.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
at
present,
if
she
doesn't
pay
$250,
the
court
and
you
noticed
in
my
brief
said
if
she
doesn't
pay
within
24
hours,
she
goes
to
jail.
well,
that
--
that's
in
my
brief
here.
if
she
--
it
says
she
doesn't
pay
me
on
--
in
(inaudible).
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
possibly,
but
i'm
wondering
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
well,
i'm
wondering
if
--
well,
that
we
must
take
the
extraordinary
remedies
in
order
to
--
in
order
to
proceed
with
this
court
or
just
the
regular
remedies
of
appeal.
i
would
require
to
take
the
extraordinary
remedy
if
available
which
i
doubt
before
coming
to
this
court.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
we
possibly
could
but
that's
a
question
of
(inaudible)
in
the
second
place,
are
we
required?
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
the
city
attorney
wasn't
quite
sure.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
after
attempt
to
add
through
the
arguments
of
able
amicus
curiae,
first
of
all,
our
position
is
that
criminal
registration
is
inherently
a
denial
of
due
process
and
of
equal
protection.
first
of
all,
aside
from
the
limited
adoption
which
have
been
pointed
by
amicus
curiae
and
the
fact
that
over
the
rest
of
the
civilized
western
world
is
almost
unheard-of,
though
they
have
similar
social
problems,
similar
criminal
problem
nowhere
except
in
the
united
states
and
only
here
in
--
in
(inaudible)
recent
period
of
time
do
we
have
such
an
ordinance.
los
angeles
made
the
way
in
1933.
it
is
--
but
i
think
limitedly
adopted.
many
of
the
major
cities
have
not
adopted
it
and
in
fact
majority
of
these
have
not
adopted
it,
only
about
17%
having
done
so
up
to
this
time.
there
is
no
showing
that
it
has
any
effect
in
deterring
the
crime
rate,
but
there
is
certainly,
a
showing
both
by
this
case
and
case
of
which
the
court
might
take
judicial
notice,
and
i'll
go
in
that
a
minute,
that
there
have
been
an
increase
in
police
harassment
of
individuals.
on
the
first
place,
everyone
of
the
counsel
here
involved,
either
for
appellee
or
appellant
or
as
amicus
curiae
has
asked
the
court
in
effect
to
look
into
the
surrounding
circumstances
as
presented
by
our
various
briefs
and
i
think
that
is
an
appeal
for
the
court
to
take
judicial
notice
of
the
--
the
setting
in
which
this
statute
arises.
and
from
that
standpoint,
i
--
i
asked
--
i
have
incorporated
in
my
brief
the
article,
the
able
article
of
university
of
pennsylvania
which
is
the
best
single
treatment
of
this
problem
and
as
the
court
considered
along
with
the
other
circumstances
presented
in
the
brief
of
the
other
party.
and
certainly,
under
that
treatment,
it
clearly
appears
that
there
has
not
been
a
decrease
in
crime
rate,
there
has
been
an
increase
in
police
harassment.
i
submit
that
this
was
panic
along
this
legislation
which
has
no
real
basis
and
fact
as
pointed
out
by
the
article
which
i
mentioned
almost
in
--
in
deductive
portion
thereof
that
--
that
there
was
not
in
fact
any
increase
in
crime
in
the
1930s,
only
an
increase
alarm
about
it.
and
it
certainly
has
not
does
decrease.
it
says
the
adoption
of
this
ordinance
anywhere,
where
it
has
been
adopted.
on
the
other
hand,
this
ordinance
inherently
encourages
police
violation
of
privacy
and
false
arrest.
now,
i
submit
that
the
reason
behind
this
ordinance
have
to
do
with
facilitating
effectivity
of
--
of
a
sort
which
we
don't
really
look
upon
the
favor,
namely,
police
discrimination.
one
other
instance
in
which
this
had
been
prominent,
as
may
have
the
american
law
institute
in
its
model
penal
code
and
the
comments
thereto,
to
strongly
recommend
that
moral
offenses
particularly
in
the
realm
of
sex
be
eliminate
as
criminal
acts
where
voluntary
acts
of
--
concerning
portable
party
because
one
reason
is
given
among
others
is
that
in
this
field,
police
harassment
has
been
the
rule
and
that
it
has
inherently
a
prejudicial
thing
to
the
rights
of
people.
i
submit
that
this
particular
category.
we
do
not
face
with
false
in
the
same
general
classification
of
--
of
statutes
which
just
amend
themselves
in
its
very
nature.
and
i
--
i
think
that
it
was
in
the
mind
of
those
who
organized
and
planned
this
particular
thing,
to
put
a
weapon
in
the
hands
of
police,
to
discriminate
against
criminals
that
they
did
not
like.
and
of
course,
under
the
rule
of
this
court
(inaudible)
even
if
the
ordinance
have
had
a
--
a
proper
intent
if
it
--
in
effect
if
it's
misapplied,
it
becomes
unconstitutional
in
the
application.
the
law
has
an
inherent
banishment
effect
in
that
it
discourages
the
interest
even
for
vacation
of
people
into
a
locality,
a
personification
who,
two
weeks
to
a
month,
if
he
comes
to
--
to
vacation
to
los
angeles,
he
must
register
there
for
more
than
five
days.
in
fact,
that
he
passes
to
los
angeles
more
than
five
times
in
a
30-day
period,
he
must
register
to
the
chief
of
police
even
though
he
is
not
a
resident.
now,
i
submit
that
the
requirement
of
registration
with
the
police
department
is
such
a
facilitation
of
one's
own
prosecution
as
to
be
contrary
to
the
principle
against
self-incrimination.
the
mere
registration
is
that
the
principal
effectiveness
and
purpose
of
it
is
to
make
it
easy
for
the
police
to
prosecute.
and
that,
i
submit,
is
contrary
to
fair
playing
contrary
to
due
process,
contrary
to
the
principle
against
self-incrimination.
the
giving
of
this
personal
information
about
your
residence
or
your
various
residences
and
the
like
are
an
invasion
of
your
right
to
privacy.
and
finally,
the
requirement
of
certain
specific
information
about
your
prior
criminal
background
is
certainly
self-incrimination
and
that
it
enables
the
state
based
upon
your
written
admissions
to
find
you
guilty
upon
any
subsequent
violation
of
being
a
recidivist
or
habitual
criminal
by
your
own
admission.
in
other
words,
you
must
here
reveal
every
criminal
act,
felony,
misdemeanor
you've
engaged
in.
and
this
is
evidence
of
lead
for
which
you
may
be
prosecuted
immediately,
as
the
--
as
the
habitual
criminal
or
at
least
upon
any
subsequent
prosecution
for
a
single
crime.
you've
given
the
evidence
of
your
previous
crime
upon
which
recidivism
may
be
proven.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
i
would
not
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
none
for
all
accounts.
this
is
a
case
of
first
impression.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
i
believe
that
in
the
case
of
people
against
shirley
in
the
criminal
of
--
of
the
appellate
department,
it
was
held
at
that
time
that
the
wording
“punishable
as
a
felony”
was
--
was
vague
at
that
time
because
--
because
we
have
in
california
a
--
a
peculiar
situation
that
a
judge
decide
by
his
sentence
whether
not
a
crime
which
has
already
been
committed
was
a
felony
or
misdemeanor.
and
i
think
the
criminal
--
people
against
shirley,
criminal
appeals
1605
of
the
appellate
department
did
consider
that
phase
of
it,
the
--
the
vagueness
of
it.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
i
do
not
--
do
not
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
--
do
not
include
that
in
my
brief.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
well,
the
only
one
i
have
is
criminal
appeals
1605
in
the
appellate
department
of
the
superior
court.
i
don't
believe
it
was
a
reported
decision
or
may
have
been
--
or
may
have
been.
and
--
and
in
in
re
digiuro,
100
cal.
app.
2d
260,
this
is
a
reported
case,
223
p.
2d
263,
a
1950
case.
in
that
particular
setting,
the
--
the
court
did
overrule
the
conviction
on
ground
somewhat
different
than
those
in
here,
but
it
was
--
it
was
the
same
ordinance.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
223
p.
2d
263.
now,
it
would
seem
that
any
law
which
required,
as
indicated
by
amicus
curiae,
anyone
who
has
been
committed
of
a
crime
anywhere
in
the
world
for
so
long
a
period,
who
comes
in
--
into
our
city,
the
angel
city
which
--
which
beckons
the
more
people
that
any
other
city
in
the
world
today,
i
think.
minimal
requirement
of
failure
to
due
process
will
be
some
form
of
notice
to
these
people
under
affected
nation,
so
they
would
not
fall
into
crafts
for
the
unwary.
and
--
and
the
minimal
requirement,
it's
just
in
my
brief
and
in
an
argument
of
amicus
curiae
is
that
the
--
prior
to
arresting
these
people,
who
don't
know
the
existence
of
the
ordinance,
they
never
heard
of
it
perhaps
because
they
never
been
even
leave
in
this
--
in
the
entire
state,
would
be
for
the
police
department
to
say
“before
we're
going
to
incriminate
you
for
this
act
of
yours
and
for
this
innocent
act
of
not
registering,
we
will
give
you
the
opportunity
to
register.
if
you
not
do
so,
you
have
violated
a
los
angeles
city
ordinance.”
but
that
is
not
the
custom.
it's
not
the
policy.
certainly,
it
was
not
done
in
this
case
which
we
are
now
faced
with,
we
she
was
not
given
the
opportunity
to
register.
that
is
a
matter
of
record.
rather,
she
was
falsely
arrested
and
when
a
criminal,
before
anything
else,
she
held
it
for
not
having
been
convicted
for
--
for
not
having
registered
for
crimes
she
committed
four
years
previously.
now,
we
submit
that
ordinance
here
is
a
vague
one,
particularly,
subsection
(d)
10
of
--
of
section
52.39
which
we
have
in
our
--
in
our
appendix,
which
provides
that
the
chief
of
police
of
los
angeles,
such
other
and
further
information
as
may
be
required
by
the
chief
of
police
for
the
purpose
of
aiding
and
assisting
in
carrying
into
effect
the
provisions
and
intent
of
this
ordinance.
now,
i
submit
that
to
--
to
give
the
chief
of
police
the
prerogative
of
deciding
what
content
it
faced
of
this
law
will
have
is
an
unconstitutional
delegation
to
--
to
the
chief
of
police
a
legislative
power.
now,
this
is
the
type
of
catch
all
frame
which
may
be
appropriate
to
constitutions
in
giving
power
to
legislative
bodies
of
such
other
and
further
as
may
be
necessary
and
proper.
but
here,
we've
given
the
chief
of
police
the
power
to
include
here
such
other
and
further
as
--
as
to
him,
maybe
necessary
and
proper
for
carrying
into
effect
this
legislation.
now,
aside
from
the
general
unconstitutionality
of
the
law,
based
upon
his
denial
of
due
process,
his
denial
of
equal
protection
in
that
the
classification
is
not
a
proper
one,
perhaps
recidivistic
criminals,
perhaps
might
be
properly
subject
to
laws
such
as
this.
there's
certain
a
person
who,
in
a
single
period
of
her
life,
at
the
age
of
21,
committed
a
--
several
forgeries
but
over
a
single
period
of
forging
checks
and
not
ever
apprehend
having
once
go
to
jail,
she
able
commit
another
forgery.
to
--
prior
to
--
first
in
that
situation
is
the
--
is
denial
of
equal
protection.
now,
aside
from
--
from
the
--
from
the
oath,
the
general
illegality
and
unconstitutionality
right
of
view
of
this
law,
in
our
specific
instance,
i
submit
that
the
appellant
was
denied
procedure
of
due
process.
assuming
the
law
to
be
valid,
which
i
--
for
the
sake
of
arguing,
first
of
all,
she
came
in
the
classic
category
of
persons
who
had
a
right
to
have
a
record
expunged
under
our
law
and
who
once
having
had
a
record
expunged,
no
longer
have
to
register.
however,
as
appears
to
record
here,
on
page
39,
the
court,
and
--
and
also
upon
the
--
the
exact
wording
which
has
been
supplied
in
the
--
by
amicus
curiae
in
its
appendix,
the
court
in
her
case
and
in
the
only
case
i
have
ever
known
on
my
experience
of
practice,
instead
of
setting
aside
of
conviction
at
the
end
of
her
period
of
--
of
probation
because
as
indicated,
she
get
probations
and
never
went
to
put
them
--
never
went
to
the
felony
jail
and
she
--
and
she
--
all
in
certain
--
deal
when
she
did,
she
have
it
as
a
term
of
probation
only.
and
yet,
at
the
end
of
that,
the
court
rather
than
expunging
the
record
as
she
had
a
right
to
stated
specifically
that
this
case
shall
not
be
expunged
and
dismissed.
so
she
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
i
--
i
don't
understand.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
that
--
that
is
right.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
checks.
i
think
they
were
fictitious
name
checks
as
i
recall.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
probably
a
month.
i
would
say,
that
she
--
she
forged
several
checks
over
a
period
of
a
month.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
in
los
angeles
and
--
at
age
of
21.
now
--
at
any
rate,
after
she's
completed
her
--
her
service
of
probation
for
this
offence,
instead
of
probation
department
is
normally
coming
into
the
court
and
--
and
setting
aside
the
record,
expunging
it
for
the
first
she
does
not
have
to
register,
they
could
not
pick
of
action
because
the
court
specifically
ordered
that
her
record
not
be
dismissed
or
expunged,
which,
i
submit,
was
ultra
vires
to
the
powers
of
the
court
and
denied
due
process
to
account.
second,
her
rest
was
clearly
on
--
on
the
record
here
without
warrant,
without
showing
of
probable
cause,
a
false
arrest
and
after
having
been
--
not
showing
to
be
involving
any
law
of
felony
or
misdemeanor
at
the
time
of
the
arrest,
she
was
held
probably
to
protect
the
arrest
for
not
registering
for
a
crime
she
has
committed
four
years
previously.
now,
i
submit
too
that
the
sentence
here
was
clearly
unreasonable.
by
certain
appendages
to
the
briefs
of
the
--
either
the
appellee
or
the
amicus
curiae
broadly
has
pointed
out
the
very
nominal
sentences
usually
given
to
these
matters,
which
are
usually
$25
for
just
a
few
days.
in
this
case,
that
perhaps
attorney
for
appellee
held
up
on
the
reason
for
in
our
previous
argument
because
this
trial
took
four
days
at
the
court's
time
or
they
had
court
to
four
days.
she's
given
probably
the
stiffest
sentence
in
history
for
this
offense,
a
$250
fine.
i
have
never
known
of
any
--
and
there
are
no
indications
in
the
record
here
of
--
of
the
sentence
presented
by
their
briefs
of
any
larger
fine
than
that.
and
three
years
probation
for
which
is
the
maximum
law
under
california
law
where
merely
a
technical
crime
was
in
no
question
that
she
did
not
know
about.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
three
years.
some
probation
provided
she
plead
to
the
court
of
meetly
$250
fine
forthwith
and
as
she
violate
no
law
relating
to
morals
and
as
i
recall,
moral
law
of
dealing
this
problem.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
no.
the
forgery
(inaudible)
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
convicted
of
not
--
she
was
convicted
four
--
four
years
before
and
certain
probation
and
--
and
completed
that
sentence.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
but
she
was
arrested
four
years
later,
the
reason
for
the
arrest
not
being
clear.
she
was
simply
arrested
falsely.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
that's
right.
that,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
well,
from
the
time
of
the
forgery
until
the
time
of
this
--
of
this
conviction,
she
had
been
convicted
of
nothing,
felony
or
misdemeanor.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
this
effect,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
first
thing
the
officer
did
when
he
made
the
arrest
is
let
me
look
at
your
arms
which
is
the
typical
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
--
approach
to
suspecting
narcotic
users
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
--
without
a
showing
of
a
basis
for
completing
that
she
actually
is.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
well,
i
think
that
falls
to
the
rest
of
the
proceeding.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
her
arms
were
looked
at
nothing
was
found
there
upon.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
but
later
--
later
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
i'm
not
sure
they
meet
that
objection.
i
thought
it
appeared
from
the
face
of
--
we
--
we
attack
the
whole
--
the
whole
conviction
and
--
and
the
constitutionality
of
the
law.
i
don't
think
we
specifically
indicated
to
that
point
that
the
sentence
was
unreasonable.
i
think
that
appears
again
from
the
standpoint
of
a
--
of
a
judicial
notice
of
what
happened
in
most
of
these
cases.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
and
three
years
probation
which
is
the
maximum
allowable
for
a
mere
technical
violation
which
no
man
can
be
--
can
be
satisfied
by
registering,
simply
be
registering.
in
this
case,
the
judge
could
not
require
her
to
register
because
she
had
a
record
expunged
before
trial.
she
couldn't
be
required
to
register.
and
yet,
you
give
her
three-year
probation
and
$250
fine
and
go
between
the
rest
of
the
time
of
trial
or
no
longer
in
the
category
of
a
person
to
apply
to
registry.
so
therefore,
at
the
time
of
the
arrest,
she
was
technically
in
violation.but
before
the
trial,
she
was
no
longer
in
violation
and
yet,
the
--
the
maximum
probation
and
$250
fine
payable
forthwith.
(inaudible)
been
prohibited
at
that
time,
but
it
met
in
(inaudible)
as
in
violating
possible
term
of
probation.
another
procedural
trial
did
not
deny
--
did
not
afford
her
with
--
it's
on
the
record
in
page
23
of
the
transcript
was
that
a
formal
appeal,
we
would
--
were
asked
to
request
the
court
to
supply
us
the
record
of
the
trial
in
forma
pauperis.
we
have
previously
submitted
a
statement
on
appeal
and
we
had
pointed
out
a
writ
of
mandate
proceeding
that
the
court
had
arbitrarily
settled
that
contrary
to
rules
of
court,
as
it
appears
on
record
here.
we
then
asked
the
appellate
department
based
upon
a
law
which
it
was
passed
during
this
proceeding,
before
it
was
been
heard
which
then
permitted
misdemeanor
appellant
for
the
first
time
in
california
history
to
get
a
record
at
public
expense.
we
--
we
request
the
court
to
give
us
the
record
of
the
expense
and
this
was
denied.
and
i
submit
that
under
the
provisions
of
--
under
the
ruling
of
a
recent
case
of
this
court
which
i
don't
have
cite
here
but
was
a
case
involving
appellate
procedure
of
state
of
illinois
in
which
i
recall
a
concurring
opinion
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
a
very
recent
case,
holding
that
--
to
deny
an
equal
record
--
equal
right
to
appeal
the
person
merely
because
they
are
poor
is
a
denial
of
due
process
and
the
only
reason
in
--
in
this
case,
it
appears
in
the
record,
because
we
requested
the
--
the
word
for
word
transcript
rather
than
the
summary
statement.
the
only
reason
why
it
was
not
forwarded
to
us
was
the
fact
that
--
that
appellant
could
not
pay
for
the
written
--
for
the
specific
wording
of
the
--
the
verbatim
wording
of
the
trial,
which
would
--
which
would
have
--
we
point
out
that
time
indicated
to
the
court,
things
we
had
inadvertently
admitted
upon
the
--
from
the
standpoint
of
false
arrest.
particularly,
it
says
(inaudible)
case
which
now
forbids
introduction
of
evidence
in
california,
evidence
obtained
following
a
false
arrest,
arrest
without
probable
cause.
also,
it
was
decided
after
the
arrest
here,
by
the
--
appellate
courts
have
held
that
upon
appeal
in
california,
we
made
for
the
first
time
in
both
the
(inaudible)
rule,
as
it
would
--
as
it
will
not
be
ruled
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
we
may
have
been
invoked
for
the
first
time
upon
appeal
and
we
did
that
here.
but
we
actually
invoked
it
upon
trial
that
this
was
a
false
arrest
and
introduction
of
evidence
is
based
thereupon,
with
that
constitution,
violated
appellant's
rights.
so,
from
the
standpoint
then
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
law,
as
well
as
the
proceedings
as
against
this
specific
case,
we
feel
that
appellant
is
entitled
to
reversal
of
the
conviction
of
this
case.
are
there
any
questions?
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
beneath
the
certain
fact
that
judge
waters
and
i
argued
constitutional
law
for
--
for
the
first
two
days
of
this
trial,
my
remaining
10
minutes
will
--
will
seem
small
indeed.
it's
been
mentioned
several
times
about
appellant's
case
taking
four
days.
for
the
first
two
days,
judge
waters
and
i
argued
constitutional
law
and
i
don't
think
that
we
should
have
gotten
angry
at
the
appellant
because
of
that
fact.
it
was
due
mainly
to
the
fact
that
judge
waters
had
to
take
the
case
that
i
cited
and
obvious
after
two,
justified
the
prosecution.
it
took
two
days.
we
submitted
the
facts
in
about
five
minutes
except
for
what
to
me
is
the
most
important
fact
of
the
case.
we
never
admitted
mens
rea
and
contracts
of
provision
taken
here
by
appellee,
my
feeling
is
that
the
true
law
in
this
type
of
situation
as
stated
by
this
court
in
the
united
states
against
kahriger,
345
u.s.22.
in
this
case,
a
person
who
knew
of
the
law
and
yet,
he
said,
“i
will
not
register
or
--
or
as
a
gambler,”
whatever
it
was,
“until
i
test
the
constitutionality
of
this
thing”.
and
this
court
held
that
as
long
as
he
was
in
good
faith
knowing
the
law,
not
registering
but
the
test
of
constitutionality
that
he
was
not
guilty
of
--
of
criminal
intent,
then
i
submit
that
--
that
appellant
here
has
to
have
no
less
benefit.
the
--
here's
--
certainly
a
person
who
know
the
law,
the
liberty
of
violation
or
to
make
a
test
case
which,
i
think,
is
--
is
probable
seizure
as
long
as
he
in
good
faith
as
he
was
in
this
case,
that
--
when
you
don't
even
know
the
existence
but
--
but
if
you
did
know
what
would
--
would
either
register
or
perhaps
to
make
a
test
case,
it'll
be
readily
wrongly
had
been
done.
but
certainly,
the
rule
of
kahriger
is
to
the
effect
that
we
--
there
must
be
a
criminal
intent
in
this
sort
of
situation.
now,
this
is
not
all
like
the
typical
regulatory
statutes
which
had
been
mentioned
by
a
police,
regulatory
implies
the
regulation
of
a
specific
conduct,
say
to
selling
something,
food
or
drug.
say
the
driving
of
car,
a
person
may
have
ability
to
have
a
car
inspected,
a
duty
to
check
his
lights,
a
duty
to
have
his
food
and
--
and
drug
checked.
but
here,
a
person
is
simply
living
in
a
community,
as
--
as
they
imply,
amicus
curiae
for
appellant.
a
--
a
perfectly
passive
status
with
no
action
at
all,
with
--
this
--
they
are
required
to
know
some
way
that
because
they
are
just
living
in
the
community,
must
check
a
law
and
see
whether
now
they
have
to
register
an
ex-con
as
an
ex-con.
it
is
particularly
unfair
since
the
laws
are
all
for
a
reason.
the
law
says
33
and
there
are
number
of
jurisdiction
and
above
all,
there
are
only
five
states,
california
being
one
in
the
whole
united
states,
only
five
which
our
states
have
enacted
such
a
law
of
this.
those
had
been
limited
to
--
to
either
--
to
narcotic
offenders
or
the
sex
offenders
in
every
instance,
those
five
states.
there
have
never
been
the
general
catchall
felonies
as
you
wish
to
apply
to
state
laws
which
apply
the
registration
are
limited.
and
i
submit
that
that
limitation
in
itself
made
a
competent
constitution
reasonableness
although
i
have
my
doubt
of
it.
but
certainly,
it
comes
closer
to
being
reasonable
than
does
our
present
ordinance.
now
--
and
--
and
one
other
point
which
particularly
in
california
are
section
290
of
the
penal
code
specifically
requires
that
notice
be
given
before
the
person
is
required
to
register
by
the
court
itself.
and
they
are
required
to
sign
in
writing,
“we
have
been
informed
of
our
duty
to
register.”
and
that
has
made
a
part
of
the
record
of
the
case.
and
i
submit
that
this
kind
of
a
law
had
to
be
dealt
at
all.
it
must
first
be
limited.
and
above
all,
some
form
of
notice
must
be
given
before
a
person
to
be
held
a
criminal
for
not
registering,
particularly
as
applies
to
incoming
migrants.
and
i
submit
that
the
only
way
that
they
can
be
properly
approached
is
to
require
the
police
not
as
in
their
discretion
but
as
matter
of
the
law,
built
in
to
the
law,
that
before
you
register
and
before
you
can
pick
the
thencoming
people,
you
must
give
them
first
a
chance
to
register
and
explain
the
law
to
them.
.and
this
is
under
section
290,
the
court
itself
or
the
probation
officer
or
--
or
someone
and
also
the
state
must,
not
in
distress,
and
as
a
matter
of
law,
tell
these
people,
“you
are
required
to
register,
sign
here
that
you've
been
told
for.”
we
have
nothing
anywhere
near
that
application
of
reasonableness
in
--
in
our
department.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
yes.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
i
--
i
do,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
so
hold.
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
--
the
holding
of
the
article
under
that
section
in
corpus
juris
secundum.
there
are
exceptions.
i
think
i've
cited
in
my
brief
where
the
law
is
obscure
as
it
is
here.
and
i
think
too
what
is
the
new
law
as
it
is
here
and
where
--
i
think
we
are
in
passive
state
status
as
--
as
that
--
put
by
amicus
curiae
is
involved.
i
think
those
are
exceptions
to
the
--
to
the
number
of
presumption
that
we
all
or
presume
to
know
the
law.
i
think
that
they
are
legally
recognized
exceptions.
i
think
that
here
above
all
in
the
passive
situation,
certain
exception
should
be
applied.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
well,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
simply
by
placing
the
burden
upon
the
state
of
informing
them
so
there
can
be
no
question.
you
see,
rather
to
leave
the
burden
upon
the
millions
of
migrants
we
have
in
california
or
in
other
cities,
city
of
los
angeles,
placing
the
burden
upon
them,
we
could
put
upon
the
state
the
burden
so
easily,
so
conveniently,
so
firm
of
--
of
informing
them,
“we
want
to
register,”
if
indeed
our
policy
is
not
to
make
criminals
out
of
america
is
what
we
do
part
too
much
of.
but
--
but
we
--
we're
trying
to
enforce
a
law
that
the
idea
is
to
get
them
to
register,
not
put
him
in
jail
for
not
registering,
and
it's
a
very
simple
thing
just
to
tell
them
either
to
the
court
or
to
the
arresting
officers,
“we
want
you
to
register
if
you
want
to
live
in
los
angeles.
no,
you
didn't
know
this
because
you
do
here,”
and
because
--
because
even
lawyers
do
not
know
the
law,
as
i
did
when
this
thing
first
of
rule.
and
many
others,
as
i
discussed,
never
heard
about
it.
it's
a
very
simple
thing
to
place
the
burden
upon
the
government.
and
i
think
the
constitutional
clearance
requires
them
to
let
this
people
know,
“we
want
you
to
register
if
you
live
in
los
angeles,”
if
indeed
it's
the
law
(inaudible)
that
constitute
all
which
i
have
my
doubt
about.
i'm
personally
(inaudible).
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
it
is
not
so
and
certainly
it
would
not
apply
in
our
specific
case.
but
i
think
there
should
be
a
requirement
in
the
law
and
not
after
the
women
could
preach
of
individual
arresting
officers,
mr.
justice
harlan,
which
is
--
which
is
the
situation
which
admitted
here
is
left
to
the
(inaudible)
of
the
officer
who,
if
you're
uncooperative,
you
don't
stand
attention
or
salute,
you
can
stand
up
and
you
can
express
your
constitutional
right,
free
to
speak
as
i
think
you're
arresting
me
falsely,
you're
on
property
if
you're
going
to
hold
you
and
show
you
that
we're
the
biggest
here,
which
is
what
happened
in
this
case.
and
on
one
other
point,
we
made
an
offer
of
proof
that
we
did
not
know
that
we
had
registered.
under
that,
mr.
judge
(inaudible)
could
have
been
shown
that
the
officers
gave
her
a
chance
to
register
if
--
if
that
were
the
case.
the
question
was
raised
by
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
as
whether
or
not
in
this
case,
she
was
given
a
right
the
chance
to
register.
but
had
that
been
so,
it
could
have
been
showed
on
our
offer
of
proof
that
she
had
no
notes
of
any
kind
and
no
knowledge
that
she
had
registered.
and
had
the
officer
give
her
such
notice
that
could
have
been
brought
in
under
cross-examination.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
in
the
first
place,
we
made
an
offer
of
proof
before
conviction.
we
made
an
offer
of
showing
intent.
our
whole
factual
of
defense
was
intent,
no
intent,
no
mens
rea,
no
notice.
perhaps,
the
officer
given
her
notice
as
was
suggested
here,
we
don't
know
whether
he
did
or
not.
they
could
have,
under
cross-examination,
shown
that
in
fact,
she
didn't
have
notice
because
we
told
her
to
register
or
go
to
jail.
i
mean
that
was
never
been
upon
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
or
motion
for
arrest
of
judgment,
that
was
then
a
proof
of
the
witness
that
goes
through
to
stand
for.
we
concede
it
that
she
hadn't
registered.
we
wanted
to
show
that
she
did
not
know
she
had
to
register.
and
at
that
point,
surely,
they
could
have
brought
in
the
cross-examination
the
officer
told
her
to
register
or
go
to
jail
which
was
not
--
obviously
not
the
fact.
so
it
nearly
screwed
what
(inaudible)
back
to
defense
but
we
got
from
a
demurrer
raised
constitutional
objection
with
the
hope
of
the
people.
now,
the
fact
as
--
as
contended
by
the
--
by
the
attorney
general
here
that
uncooperative
people
are
people
at
high
rate
crime
rate
areas
are
the
ones
who
get
registered
or
get
convicted
under
this
law,
shows
that
the
great
discretion
and
leeway
letting
the
police
officer
to
decide
who
--
who
to
prosecute
and
--
and
this
would
have
a
particular
heavy
insight
from
the
minority
group
because
they
tend
to
live
at
high
crime
rate
areas
and
are
subject
more
throughout
the
rest
and
here,
it
often
aren't
cooperative
because
they
do
resent
that
thing
and
here
people
who
aren't
cooperative
live
in
high
crime
rate
areas
are
just
singled
out
admittedly
by
the
police
for
prosecution
whereas
other
people
are
not
prosecuted
but
are
given
the
chance
to
register.
i
think
we
should
not
them
let
the
people
to
discriminate
the
matter
of
law,
the
matter
of
constitutional
right
that
people
must
first
be
informed
if
we
do
want
them
to
be
registered
rather
that
to
be
made
criminals
again
when
they
try
to
straighten
up
and
be
decent
american
citizen.
as
for
the
congressional
law
i
mentioned
i
do
not
know
what
it
would
be
faced
whether
they
were
brought
here
and
couldn't
relevant
here,
to
me,
of
course,
to
come
under
attack.
but
it's
certainly
is
a
more
limited
thing.
and
i
also
i
submit
that
it
would
require
notice,
would
require
criminal
intent
of
law
which
was
passed
by
congress
in
1956
requiring
a
limited
group
of
narcotic
vendors
to
register.
i
suspect
that
as
under
all
federal
laws
which
i
have
noticed,
they
would
require
(inaudible)
and
probably
therefore
a
notice
that
they
had
to
register.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
i
--
i've
noticed
in
--
in
the
narcotics
case,
which
i
have
to
print
if
the
court
required
that
he
presumed
knowledge
of
importation
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
what
--
where
you?
at
least
--
i'm
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
may
i
state
that
under
this
kahriger
rule,
if
i
pronounced
the
name
right,
i
think
that
would
certainly
be
the
situation.
and
it
is
not
a
difficult
thing
because
we
have
them
under
our
present
criminal
law
cite.
i
know
i
must
register.
i
did
inform
the
court
as
a
matter
of
court
record.
he
had
the
reporter's
records
transcribed.
they
were
--
they
were
informed
in
open
court
of
his
duty
to
register.
and
they've
signed.
they
have
been
told
the
matter
of
record.
they
cannot
deny
because
we
have
--
we
have
shown
conclusively
that
they
did
know
the
state
opinion.
they've
heard
in
open
court.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
i
think,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
that
it
is
true
and
that
it
--
that
it
should
apply
and
that
the
burden
of
proof
should
be
upon
the
state
if
they
want
to
--
to
have
this
kind
of
law
this
--
which
is
an
unusually
unique
and
a
strange
law.
at
first,
they
(inaudible)
at
all
but
i
do
think
that
we
do
consider
the
--
the
concept
of
criminal
registration
constitutional
at
all,
that
it
must
be
with
proper
notice
even
if
we
don't
limit
to
this
small
kind
of
appeal.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
i
agree,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
on
--
on
that
point.
as
one
of
the
points,
as
i
think
i
have
attempted
to
raise
in
my
brief
along
with
many
others
that
i've
tried
to
think
every
possible
to
concede
the
point
including
the
vagueness
of
the
ordinance
other
than
--
as
to
what
--
when
you
are
pressed
of
felony,
particularly
says
its
strictly
to
the
court
as
to
whether
or
not
a
crime
is
actually
a
felony
or
a
misdemeanor,
if
it
is
possible
to
felony
and
also
of
the
right
given
to
the
chief
of
police
to
pass
whatever
law
may
be
necessary
and
proper
to
--
i
mean
whatever
--
may
be
necessary
and
proper
of
carrying
into
effect
the
registration
ordinance
for
a
number
of
other
reasons
which
i
have
attempted.
i
-
i
think
i
have
tried
to
incorporate
the
various
points
made
by
mr.
justice
whittaker.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
i
think,
mr.
justice
black,
that
i
made
both
points.
my
first
--
i'm
sure
she
had
no
criminal
intent
at
all
--
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
--
and
no
violation.
(inaudible)
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
i
didn't
understand.
mr.
samuel
c.
mcmorris
i
didn't
make
that
point,
justice.
thank
you,
sir.
