mr.
warren
m.
christopher
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
superior
court
of
the
state
of
california.
the
appeal
raises
questions
concerning
the
validity
of
appellant's
conviction
for
violation
of
a
los
angeles
ordinance
relating
to
the
registration
of
convicted
persons.
the
ordinance
in
issue
makes
a
crime
for
a
person
to
be
or
remain
in
the
city
of
los
angeles
for
more
than
five
days
without
registering
with
the
chief
of
police.
in
the
course
of
the
registration
process,
the
convicted
person
will
be
required
to
give
personal
information
about
himself
in
10
different
categories
and
he
will
also
be
photographed
and
fingerprinted.
“a
convicted
person”
that
term
is
defined
in
the
ordinance
in
a
most
comprehensive
manner
to
include
anyone
who
has
been
convicted
any
place
in
the
world
since
1921
of
a
crime
punishable
in
california
as
a
felony.
the
crime
created
by
the
ordinance
is
punishable
both
by
a
fine
and
by
imprisonment,
and
each
day's
violation
is
a
separate
offense.
the
appellant
here
was
arrested
and
charged
with
a
violation
of
this
ordinance
in
february
of
1955.
the
evidence
at
her
trial
in
a
los
angeles
municipal
court
showed
that
she
had
been
convicted
in
1951
of
the
crime
of
forgery
which
is
an
offense
punishable
in
california
as
a
felony.
the
evidence
further
showed
that
appellant
had
not
registered
with
the
chief
of
police
at
the
time
of
her
arrest
and
that
she
was
a
resident
of
los
angeles.
at
her
trial,
appellant
sought
to
show
that
she
did
not
know
of
the
existence
of
this
ordinance
but
the
court
excluded
that
testimony.
the
jury
found
the
appellant
guilty
as
charged
and
the
court
imposed
sentence.
a
felon's
conviction
was
appealed
to
the
superior
court
for
los
angeles
county
but
that
court
affirmed
in
a
brief
opinion
stating
that
there
was
no
merit
to
the
claim
that
the
ordinance
was
unconstitutional
and
that
it
is
no
defense
that
appellant
did
not
know
of
the
registration
requirement.
that
decision
was
the
pronouncement
of
the
highest
california
court
to
which
an
appeal
could
be
taken
in
this
case
and
therefore,
an
appeal
was
taken
to
this
court,
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
the
case
was
argued
here
last
term.
and
near
the
end
of
the
term,
it
was
set
down
for
reargument.
i
appear
here
today
as
amicus
curiae
for
the
appellant
at
the
invitation
of
the
court.
in
the
discussion
here
today,
i
hope
to
be
able
to
emphasize
three
points.
first,
that
the
effect
of
the
ordinance
is
to
invade
the
constitutionally
protected
rights
of
the
appellant
and
other
convicted
persons.
second,
that
the
ordinance
is
not
reasonably
restricted
to
the
evil
with
which
it
purports
to
deal,
that
is
to
say
that
it's
unconstitutionally
brought
an
arbitrary
in
its
scope
and
coverage
and
third,
that
appellant's
conviction
in
the
absence
of
wrongful
intent
amounts
to
a
deprivation
of
due
process.
turning
first
to
consider
the
effect
of
the
ordinance
on
a
convicted
person's
right,
i
would
point
out
that
the
ordinance
erodes
a
convicted
person's
right
to
privacy.
at
the
time
of
registration,
the
convicted
person
is
required
to
reveal
a
great
deal
of
personal
information
as
well
as
his
past
criminal
record.
all
of
this
registration
data
including
his
photograph
and
fingerprints
may
be
transmitted
to
other
law
enforcement
agencies.more
significantly,
his
photograph
will
be
put
in
a
gallery
where
it
may
be
exhibited
to
members
of
the
public
and
beyond
that,
police
officers
are
currently
free
to
disclose
this
information
so
long
as
they
do
so
in
the
regular
course
of
their
duties.
this
invasion
of
privacy,
it
seems
to
me,
it's
a
convicted
person
where
it
may
hurt
him
the
most.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
well,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
it
seems
to
me
that
the
right
to
privacy
is
synthesis
of
a
number
of
different
constitutional
provisions.
certainly,
part
of
it
derives
from
the
first
amendment,
part
from
the
fourth
as
you
indicate
and
part
from
the
fifth
and
part
from
the
term
“liberty”
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
only
last
term
in
the
watkins
case,
of
course,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
court
referred
to
the
right
to
privacy
as
if
it
were
a
constitutionally
protected
right.
disclosure
of
an
ex-convict
past
record,
even
the
reminder
of
it
that's
involved
in
registration
may
undo
even
the
most
conscientious
efforts
on
his
part
to
reform.
this
is
especially
true
of
a
convicted
person
is
attempting
to
start
a
new
life
in
a
new
community.
if
the
registration
data
about
his
past
reaches
his
new
neighbors
or
his
new
friends,
even
worse,
his
new
employer,
he
may
well
conclude
that
he
really
can't
live
down
his
past
mistake.
experts
in
the
field
of
penology,
such
as
mr.
bennett,
the
director
of
federal
prisons,
emphasized
that
nothing
is
more
likely
to
interfere
with
a
convicted
person's
rehabilitation
than
of
the
disclosure
of
the
fact
that
he
has
once
been
a
prisoner.
the
convicted
person's
right
to
liberty
is
also
curtailed
by
the
los
angeles
ordinance.
in
addition
to
the
physical
burdens
of
the
registration
process,
the
fact
of
registration
may
subject
the
convicted
person
to
detention
and
questioning
in
police
roundups.
and
beyond
that,
i
don't
want
to
point
out
that
the
ordinance
limits
a
convicted
person's
right
to
move
freely
among
the
states,
his
right
to
live
and
work
where
he
will.
in
the
face
of
the
ordinance,
the
convicted
person
must
recognize
that
he
can
go
to
los
angeles
only
if
he
is
willing
to
register
with
the
chief
of
police
and
to
reregister
every
time
he
changes
his
address.
the
net
effect
of
this
is
to
put
a
burden
on
the
right
of
free
transit
which
is
one
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
guaranteed
by
the
constitution.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
since
1933.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
my
understanding
is,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
los
angeles
ordinance
was
the
forerunner
of
these
ordinances
in
this
country.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
pardon
me.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
a
study
made
by
the
university
of
pennsylvania
law
review
indicates
that
about
by
17%
of
the
cities,
over
50,000
in
this
country
have
such
ordinances.
i
might
say
that
there
is
a
study
in
my
brief
indicating
that
among
a
number
of
major
cities
in
foreign
countries,
in
which
i
have
written,
none
of
them
have
such
registration
ordinances.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
understand
your
question.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
well,
i
--
i
assumed
that
the
justification
that
will
be
urged
is
that
--
that
this
is
an
assistance
to
the
police
that
somehow,
this
aids
them
in
crime
detection
or
crime
prevention.
it
seems
to
me,
in
the
first
place,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
that's
a
very
speculated
and
theoretical
assistance.
they
have
a
great
deal
of
information
to
the
fbi
file
from
--
from
the
california
bureau
of
investigation
that,
i
think,
gives
them
substantially
the
same
information.
i'm
not
a
good
one
to
talk
about
this,
so
i'm
sure
you'll
hear
more
about
its
great
value
from
the
other
side.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
i'm
sure
that's
right.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
well,
i'm
arguing
basically
three
points
here
today.
first,
that
there
are
constitutionally
protected
rights
that
are
invaded
here,
invaded
so
significantly
that
the
little
value
that
the
ordinance
served
does
not
justify
the
invasion.
second,
i
say
that
even
though
some
of
these
ordinances
might
be
valid,
this
one
is
so
broadly
drawn
that
it's
not
reasonably
restricted
to
the
evil
at
which
it
aimed.
and
third,
i
am
saying
that
this
conviction
is
invalid
because
there
was
no
proof
that
the
defendant
here
had
any
wrongful
intent.
indeed,
i
was
about
to
say
that
the
justification
for
these
ordinances
as
a
whole
is
that
the
persons
to
whom
they
apply
are
convicted
persons,
that
is
that
they
have
been
sometime
in
their
life
convicted
of
a
felony.
now,
i've
argued
in
detail
in
my
brief
that
this
innocent
and
passive
status,
a
status
of
just
having
once
sometime
in
your
life
been
convicted
is
not
a
proper
basis
for
the
deprivation
of
constitutional
rights
anymore
than
the
status
of
being
an
indigent
or
the
status
of
being
a
member
of
a
particular
race
would
justify
the
invasion.
it
seems
fair
to
me
that
the
ordinance
is
unconstitutional
on
that
ground
that
i
refer
you
to
my
brief
on
that
point
because
it
seems
to
me,
that
there
are
narrower
grounds
for
the
decision.
one
of
the
narrower
grounds
of
the
los
angeles
ordinance
is
not
reasonably
restricted
to
the
evil
with
which
it
purports
to
deal.
the
acknowledged
purpose
of
these
ordinances
is
to
maintain
surveillance
of
professional
criminals.
as
the
city
says,
the
ordinance
is
directed
at
the
evil
of
professionalism
and
crime.
now,
despite
that
limited
purpose,
the
ordinance
itself
is
completely
undiscriminating.
it
applies
to
everyone
who
had
been
convicted
at
any
place
in
the
united
states
since
1921
of
a
crime
punishable
in
california
as
a
felony.
the
arbitrary
broadness
of
this
ordinance
can
be
seen
fairly
from
the
fact
that
it
applies
to
first
offenders
and
probationers.
the
statistics
in
my
brief
emphatically
show
that
the
great
majority
of
first
offenders
and
probationers
lead
law-abiding
lives
after
their
conviction
and
that
only
a
small
fraction
of
them
ever
get
into
trouble
with
the
law
again.
as
to
probationers,
a
careful
study
indicates
that
98%
of
an
approved
sampling
were
free
from
subsequent
convictions
of
felonies
and
that
84%
had
no
convictions
at
all,
either
misdemeanors
or
felonies.
the
figures
on
first
offenders
are
even
more
convincing.
only
about
7%
of
the
first
offenders
in
the
group
of
probationers
who
were
studied
were
subsequently
convicted
of
any
offense.
these
figures
mean
that
in
order
to
maintain
surveillance
of
the
few
first
offenders
in
probationers
who
will
commit
another
offense,
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
great
majority
will
have
been
invaded
for
no
reason
at
all.
in
terms
of
numbers,
to
maintain
surveillance
of
about
10
men
out
of
100
who
may
commit
another
crime,
the
constitutional
rights
of
about
90
men
who
will
never
commit
another
crime,
will
have
been
invaded.
in
contrast
to
the
first
offender,
the
multiple
offender
is
very
likely
to
revert
the
crime.
depending
on
the
number
of
his
prior
arrest,
the
percentage
of
multiple
offenders
who
will
return
the
crime
ranges
between
20%
to
50%
or
even
higher.
it
is
this
group
of
professional
or
habitual
criminals
that
the
ordinance
is
directed
at.
to
infringe
the
constitutional
rights
of
all
convicted
persons
to
maintain
surveillance
as
these
professional
criminals,
it
seems
to
me,
to
be
clearly
arbitrary.
the
brief
for
the
attorney
general
of
california
states
that
a
relatively
high
percentage
of
persons
admitted
to
--
to
prison
have
prior
criminal
records.
the
fallacy
in
those
figures
is
that
the
prison
population
is
a
much
different
group
statistically
than
the
group
of
convicted
persons
and
even
more
different
than
the
group
of
first
offenders
and
probationers.
the
prison
population
is
largely
made
up
of
multiple
offenders.
most
first
offenders
simply
do
not
go
to
prison.
thus,
the
attorney
general's
statistics
tell
us
almost
nothing
at
all
about
first
offenders
and
probationers,
tell
us
almost
nothing
about
whether
they
will
revert
to
crime.
all
those
statistics
of
prison
population
show
is
that
judges
don't
very
often
sentence
first
offenders
imprisonment.
i
would
point
out
that
the
ordinance
also
seems
arbitrary
in
its
scope
and
coverage
and
then
it
gives
no
weight
to
time
elapsed
since
conviction
as
long
as
the
person
had
been
convicted
since
1921
is
required
to
register
even
if
he
has
been
a
law-abiding
citizen
for
as
long
as
35
years.
such
an
ordinance,
it
seems
to
me,
is
not
only
at
war
with
our
widely
held
belief
and
rehabilitation
but
it
also
ignores
the
available
evidence
which
indicates
the
time
elapsed
since
conviction
is
a
most
important
factor
in
determining
the
likelihood
of
repetition.
if
there
is
a
significant
period
of
lawful
behavior
after
conviction,
the
likelihood
of
repetition
is
almost
new.
for
instance,
a
study
of
federal
payrollees
indicates
that
only
4%
of
those
who
violate
parole
do
so
more
than
two
years
after
their
release.
appellee's
suggestion
that
a
probationer
may
avoid
the
arguments
by
having
his
conviction
set
aside
under
a
section
of
the
california
penal
code,
seems
to
me,
to
be
entirely
shallow.our
research
indicates
that
this
statute
is
unique
to
california.
it
clearly
would
not
be
applicable
to
probationers
coming
to
california
from
another
state.
in
light
of
this
sweeping
and
undiscriminating
coverage,
it
seems
patent
to
me
that
the
los
angeles
ordinance
is
not
reasonably
restricted
to
the
evil
with
which
it
purports
to
deal
that
are
disarbitrary
and
discriminatory
and
that
therefore
offends
due
process.
i
believe
the
situation
here
is
closely
analogous
to
butler
against
michigan
last
term
where
the
court
invalidated
the
michigan
obscenity
statute
on
the
ground
that
it
was
not
reasonably
restricted
to
the
evil
with
which
it
purported
to
deal.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
i'll
ask
you
to
expand
on
that
so
i
might
reply
to
it.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
that's
right,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
character
of
this
ordinance
is
--
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
certainly,
we
made
a
conscientious
effort
to
gather
the
statistics
we
have
set
forth
in
the
brief
and
not
--
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
in
addition
to
the
defects
in
the
ordinance,
which
i've
outlined
above,
there
is
also
a
constitutional
flaw,
it
seems
to
us,
in
appellant's
conviction.
appellant
was
convicted
without
any
proof
that
she
had
any
wrongful
intent
in
failing
to
register.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
a
great
many
crimes
are
made
felonies.
the
definition,
as
i
recall
it,
mr.
justice
brennan,
is
any
crime
punishable
by
imprisonment
in
the
state
prison
for
more
than
--
any
state
prison
for
more
than
a
year.
i
would
also
point
out
that
this
ordinance
applies
not
only
to
crimes
which
are
punished
as
felonies
but
crimes
which
were
punishable
as
a
felony.
i
believe
the
appellant
here
was
not
punished
as
a
felon
in
a
sense
that
she
was
never
committed
to
a
state
prison
but
the
crime
itself
was
punishable
for
felony
which
broadens
that
category
very,
very
much.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
i
think
you
put
your
finger
on
a
very,
very
important
defect
disadvantage
to
this
kind
of
an
ordinance.
a
person
coming
from
new
jersey
is
required
to
determine
whether
or
not
his
crime
in
new
jersey,
whatever
it
was
there,
might
have
been
punishable
in
california
as
a
felony
and
it
opens
up
a
very
serious
danger
for
him.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
i
don't
know
that
there
has
been
any
determination
of
that
in
california.
i
would
assume
it
is
as
of
the
time
it
was
committed.
i
think
there
is
no
case
on
that.
there's
surprisingly
little
appellate
review
of
--
under
this
ordinance
in
california,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
i
can't
give
you
a
numerical
statement
about
that
--
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
but
i
know
that
in
a
sizable
proportions,
some
place
between
15%
and
50%
of
that
situation
would
seem
same
defect
would
in
here.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
i
can't
speak
for
mr.
linn
on
that.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
i
can't
speak
for
mr.
linn
on
that
but
i
--
i
don't
see
if
there's
really
any
problem
about
that.
the
ordinance
is
--
is
clear
that
it
applies
to
anyone
who
was
convicted
of
a
crime
punishable
in
california
as
a
felony.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
yes,
sir.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
it's
very
vulnerable.
i
wouldn't
be
satisfied
for
the
attorney
general
to
say
ordinarily
exercised
precaution
and
not
prosecute
--
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
--
these
people,
i
think,
that
gives
them
--
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
--
too
much
power
to
determine
--
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
--
who
is
in
favor
at
a
particular
time
or
the
police.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
i'm
sure,
mr.
linn
and
mr.
grey
will
be
able
to
speak
--
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
--
more
authority
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
--
my
point.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
i
don't
know
whether
there's
been
a
breakdown
or
not.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
as
i
was
beginning
to
say,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
an
additional
defect
here
and
that
appellant
was
convicted
without
any
proof
that
she
had
any
wrongful
intent.
indeed,
the
court
below
held
the
proof
--
proof
of
wrongful
intent
was
unnecessary
and
that
appellant's
lack
of
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
this
ordinance
and
for
duty
to
register
was
no
defense.
it
is
my
contention
here
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
due
process
required
proof
of
wrongful
intent.
required
proof,
that
is
that
appellant
either
knew
or
should
have
known
of
a
duty
to
register
and
wrongfully
ignored
it.
circumstances
to
which
i
refer
are
these,
first,
appellant
status
as
a
convicted
person
was
morally
innocent.
it
simply
had
no
ethical
significance.
it
didn't
give
her
that
warning
of
wrongdoing
that
we
usually
associate
with
crimes
of
violence
and
crimes
where
harm
is
done
to
someone.
beyond
that,
her
status
was
entirely
passive
and
thus,
unlike
a
person
who
is
engaged
in
some
kind
of
active
conduct,
she
had
no
reason
for
inquiring
about
the
existence
of
possible
regulatory
statutes.
furthermore,
there
was
no
proof
at
the
trial
whether
appellant
either
knew
or
should
have
known
of
the
existence
of
the
ordinance.
it
is
those
circumstances
coupled
with
the
fact
that
this
ordinance
is
punishable
by
imprisonment
as
well
as
by
a
fine
that
leads
me
to
urge
that
conviction
here
in
the
absence
of
wrongful
intent
violates
due
process.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
as
i
have
a
comment
about
that.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is,
first
of
all,
outside
the
record.
certainly
it's
hearsay
but
perhaps
more
important
than
that
to
this
court
is
the
fact
that
it's
quite
beside
the
point.
appellant
here
offered
to
testify
at
her
trial
which
she
did
not
know
of
the
existence
of
this
ordinance.
the
court
excluded
that
testimony.
that's
the
state
of
the
record
here.
now,
if
it
--
another
time,
city
of
los
angeles
could
prove
she
did
in
fact
know,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
does
not
encroach
upon
the
point
that
i
am
attempting
to
make.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
a
misdemeanor.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
it's
punishable
by
fine
and
imprisonment,
six
--
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
--
six
months
imprisonment.
the
appellant
here
was
fined
and
in
effect
$250.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
going
from
this
conviction?
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
i
don't
believe
that
that
prevents
voting
in
california.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
certainly,
it
would
not
require
registration
in
the
many
other
cities
in
california
that
have
ordinances
like
these,
though
the
kind
of
punishment
that
was
meted
out
here
to
appellant
does,
in
effect,
involved
a
civil
disability.
she
was
placed
on
probation
on
condition
that
she
paid
$250
and
that
she
not
violate
any
of
a
number
of
categories
of
laws.
in
the
morissette
case
in
connection
with
the
intent
point,
this
court
recently
canvassed
the
necessity
for
wrongful
intent
as
an
element
of
crime.
in
that
opinion,
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
elimination
of
wrongful
intent
has
been
approved
and
only
a
limited
class
of
offenses,
the
so-called
public
welfare
offenses
and
only
reluctantly
there.
although,
of
course,
the
morissette
was
a
statutory
case,
not
a
constitutional
case,
the
extents
of
historical
material
set
forth
in
that
case
make
it
clear
that
except
--
with
respect
to
the
public
welfare
offenses,
the
requirement
of
wrongful
intent
is
so
deeply
rooted
in
our
traditions
and
so
deeply
in
the
conscience
of
our
people
that
it
is
to
be
ranked
as
fundamental,
a
part
of
due
process.
when
we
consider
the
nature
of
the
crime
created
by
the
los
angeles
ordinance,
it
seems
plainly
not
to
fall
within
the
category
of
public
welfare
offenses.
public
welfare
offenses
pertain
to
matters
such
as
traffic
and
motor
vehicle,
intoxicating
liquors
and
misbranded
foods
and
drugs.
persons
convicted
of
violating
statutes
pertaining
to
such
matters
are
engaged
in
active,
not
passive
conduct
and
they
either
know
or
should
know
that
their
conduct
is
likely
to
be
subject
to
regulation.
moreover,
most
of
the
public
welfare
offenses
are
punishable
only
by
a
fine.
in
contrast,
to
go
back
over
the
effect
of
the
los
angeles
ordinance,
it
makes
a
crime
out
of
a
status
which
is
entirely
passive
and
morally
innocent.
the
crime
is
punishable
not
only
by
a
fine,
but
as
i
have
said
to
mr.
justice
black,
also
by
imprisonment.
in
this
situation,
there
is
no
reason
and
no
justification,
as
we
see
it,
for
approving
the
elimination
of
intent
as
an
element
of
the
crime.
the
attorney
general
has
pointed
out
that
this
court
has
upheld
convictions
in
the
absence
of
wrongful
intent
in
the
balint
case
in
258
u.s.
and
in
the
dotterweich
case
in
320
u.s.
there
is
only
time
for
me
to
say
about
these
cases
that
these
are
classic
public
welfare
offenses,
narcotics,
food
and
drugs
were
involved.
and
that
in
both
cases,
the
defendant
knew
or
should
have
known
that
his
conduct
was
subject
to
regulation.
to
hold
the
wrongful
intent
is
required
under
the
los
angeles
ordinance
will
not
result
in
any
drastic
change
in
the
law.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
wrongful
intent
is
the
required
element
of
every
crime,
what
i
do
contend
is
that
where
an
ordinance
make
say
morally
innocent
and
passive
status,
a
crime
punishable
by
imprisonment,
a
person's
conviction
should
be
upheld
only
if
it
is
proved
that
he
knew
or
should
have
known
of
the
existence
of
the
requirement
and
wrongfully
ignored
him.
in
practice,
this
would
mean
that
the
los
angeles
police,
when
they
arrested
a
person
who
did
not
know
of
--
of
the
ordinance
would
have
to
give
him
a
chance
to
register
before
charging
him
with
a
violation
of
the
ordinance.
to
do
otherwise,
it
seems
to
me,
constitutes
a
violation
of
due
process.
i've
reach
the
end
of
my
half
an
hour
and
i
now
giveway
--
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
--
to
mr.
mcmorris.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
certainly.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
i
made
some
efforts
to
find
out
how
it
work,
and
i
must
say
i'm
not
wholly
satisfied.
i
gather
that
they
--
when
they
bring
someone
in
on
a
charge,
perhaps
a
general
charge,
perhaps
they're
just
concerned
about
the
person
may
try
to
make
him
on
a
particular
charge
and
if
they
cannot,
then
they
inquire
into
this
and
bring
this
charge
against
them.
i
think
that
was
the
case
here.
in
another
situation,
they
may
arrest
the
person
and
ask
him
a
first
question
as
to
whether
or
not
he
is
an
ex-convict
and
has
registered.
i
doubt
if
there
are
any
overall
attempts
to
make
roundups
but
i
think
perhaps
when
a
person
comes
in
to
town
from
chicago
at
the
airport,
if
he's
been
a
--
had
a
criminal
record
there,
he
--
he
is
likely
to
be
forced
to
register
or
suggest
that
he
ought
to
get
out
of
town
if
he
doesn't
register.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
warren.
by
way
of
summary
then,
we
first
thought
to
show
here
that
the
effect
of
this
ordinance
is
to
invade
the
constitutionally
protected
right
of
convicted
persons.
the
first
one
we
mentioned
was
the
right
to
privacy.
mr.
linn
made
that
point
very
well
for
me
when
he
told
the
story
of
the
young
sex
offender
in
california
who
found
it
impossible
to
get
a
job
now
because
of
the
existence
of
his
registration.
another
constitutionally
protected
right,
which
we
feel
is
invaded
by
this
ordinance,
is
the
right
to
liberty.
and
finally,
we've
talked
about
the
right
of
free
transit
among
the
states.
the
privilege
and
immunity
and
move
freely
among
the
united
states.
i
might
bring
this
point
closer
to
home
by
asking
you
to
imagine
that
there
was
an
ordinance
in
alexandria,
one
in
arlington
and
one
in
falls
church
as
there
are
in
many
southern
california
communities.
now,
this
ordinance
has
contained
a
provision
that
if
you
go
into
a
particular
area
five
times
in
a
month,
you
have
to
register.
so
a
person
living
in
any
one
of
the
virginia
communities
would
certainly
have
to
register
in
every
other
one
because
his
normal
professional
and
social
life
would
certainly
take
him
into
the
other
community.
in
los
angeles,
the
only
way
a
person
can
be
safe
with
the
freeway
system
being
what
it
is
and
the
constant
transit
from
one
part
of
the
city
to
another
is
to
register
in
all
of
the
communities.
the
second
point
we've
attempted
to
make
is
to
say
that
if
this
ordinance
is
permissible
at
all,
it
cannot
be
sustained
here
because
it
is
not
reasonably
restricted
to
the
evil
with
which
he
purports
to
deal.
that's
mr.
whittaker's
point
exactly.
i'd
like
to
expand
that
to
say
it's
not
only
as
it
limited
--
not
limited
in
terms
of
the
offenses
that
are
included
but
as
our
brief
indicates,
it's
not
limited
in
terms
of
time
elapses
since
conviction
and
it
is
not
limited
in
terms
of
first
--
first
offenders
and
probationers.
i
would
again
point
out
that
the
statistics
that
mr.
linn
hasadduced
here
today
with
respect
to
the
prison
population
and
the
number
of
convictions
that
they
have
had
are
not
quite
in
point
with
respect
to
first
offenders
and
probationers
as
i
said
yesterday
about
all
those
statistics
prove
as
the
judges
don't
very
often
send
people
to
prison
unless
they
have
prior
records.
i'm
sure
it's
common
knowledge
to
all
of
us
that
most
first
offenders
are
put
on
probation
and
never
reach
that
prison
population.
there
are
a
great,
great
many
people
in
the
united
states
who
commit
one
crime
in
their
life
and
thereafter
lead
law-abiding
lives.
and
finally
our
third
point,
and
this
is
on
somewhat
different
level,
we
contend
that
when
a
morally
innocent
and
passive
status
has
been
made
a
crime,
conviction
of
that
crime
requires
proof
of
wrongful
intent,
requires
that
is
a
showing
defendant
knew
or
should
have
known
of
her
duty
to
register
and
ignored
it.
now,
at
this
point,
i'd
like
to
deal
with
the
question
that
mr.
justice
whittaker
raised.
he
asked
how
you
would
go
about
proving
this
matter
at
trial
that
the
defendant
always
get
off
by
saying
that
she
or
he
did
not
happen
to
know
of
the
ordinance.
if
the
answer
to
that
is
that
this
would
be
as
any
other
fact
in
the
course
of
the
trial,
if
the
defendant
claimed
that
she
did
not
know
of
her
duty
to
register,
the
prosecution
could
controvert
that
and
put
on
evidence
that
that
was
just
inherently
unbelievable.
if
the
los
angeles
police
had
publicized
this
ordinance
in
the
way
that
i
think
they
ought
to
by
radio
announcements
and
in
the
newspapers,
they
might
very
well
be
able
to
convince
the
jury
that
she
was
not
telling
the
truth
when
she
said
that
she
didn't
know
about
it.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
that
would
be
an
issue
in
the
litigation
just
as
other
issues
as
to
her
guilt
and
innocence.
and
i
see
no
insuperable
problem
in
that
regard.
i
would
mention
in
that
connection
that
i
feel
that
mr.
grey
has
almost
conceded
this
point
by
his
statement
that
it's
the
policy
of
the
police
to
permit
a
person
to
register
if
he's
picked
up
and
doesn'
know
of
the
law.
that's
exactly
what
i'm
contending
for.
i
would
just
like
to
have
that
made
more
definite
than
in
the
discretion
of
the
police,
the
statement
in
--
from
the
police
that
they
used
this
ordinance
only
with
respect
to
people
who
are
uncooperative
or
who
live
in
high
crime
areas,
i
think
it
has
in
it
a
seed
of
a
very
dangerous
harassment.
high
crime
areas
has
an
unfortunate
connotation,
meaning
areas
of
our
city
where
the
minority
groups
congregate
and
live
and
uncooperative
knows
there's
something
that
can
be
determined
by
a
particular
police
officer
in
terms
of
his
like
or
dislike
of
the
person
who
was
involved.
and
thus
we
are
contending
that
a
person
should
not
be
convicted
of
a
crime
punishable
by
imprisonment
simply
because
she
existed
for
a
period
of
time
within
the
geographical
limits
of
the
city
and
at
some
time
in
the
past
had
been
convicted
of
a
crime
punishable
with
felony
in
california.
