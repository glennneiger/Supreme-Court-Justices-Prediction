mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mcmorris,
don't
--
don't
you
think
that
in
response
to
justice
harlan's
question
that
it
would
be
better
for
you
to
tell
how
you'd
come
here
to
this
court,
tell
the
facts
of
your
case
and
--
and
then
after
you
have
done
that,
why
i
--
i
think
you'd
be
more
ready
to
convince
the
court
of
your
position
than
to
live
us
in
the
dark
until
--
until
the
last
of
your
--
of
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i
think
you
would
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
summon
them
in
the
court
at
least
would
like
to
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
mcmorris,
perhaps
we
could
term
it
this
way.
you
--
you
don't
contend
that
she
was
convicted
in
1951
of
a
crime,
which
does
not
come
under
this
ordinance
that
you
have
--
that
you're
attacking?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
well
then,
why
don't
you
jump
right
from
that
to
the
facts
of
this
case
and
let's
discuss
that
--
those
facts
and
the
ordinance.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
that
have
anything
to
do
with
the
--
with
the
constitutionality
of
this
ordinance
that
you're
talking
about?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
why
don't
you
--
why
don't
you
stay
for
a
moment
on
--
on
the
facts
and
on
the
ordinance,
and
the
question
of
whether
that
ordinance
is
--
is
constitutional
or
not
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
as
applied
to
this
case.
i
think
if
you
don't
mix
those
mr.
mcmorris,
we
--
we
will
get
along
better.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
haven't
told
us
very
much
about
that
ordinance
or
perhaps
the
terms
of
that
ordinance
would
be
pertinent
to
this
situation.
what
does
the
ordinance
require,
mr.
mcmorris?
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
what
page,
mr.
mcmorris?
chief
justice
earl
warren
19?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mcmorris,
before
you
get
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
that
on
the
question
of
expunging
the
record,
you've
been
--
you've
been
putting
a
good
bit
of
time
on
that
question
of
expunging
the
record,
but
that
applies
in
california
only
to
probation
cases,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
a
man
who
has
served
a
term
in
prison
has
no
right
and
no
opportunity
to
expunge
his
record
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
the
court.
so
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
your
argument
goes
to
a
special
class
of
--
of
convicted
persons
because
this
woman
was
of
this
--
of
this
particular
class.
she
had
been
given
probation
and
did
have
the
opportunity
to
expunge
the
record.
the
vast
majority
of
people
who
are
convicted
of
felony
and
will
go
--
will
go
to
the
penitentiary
have
no
right
to
expunge
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
--
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
grey.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
grey,
may
i
--
may
i
suggest
that
the
--
at
the
outset
--
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
your
argument,
but
at
the
outset
would
you
mind
stating
the
--
the
facts
succinctly
and
--
and
the
statutes
on
which
we're
relying,
and
to
--
brings
us
up
to
this
--
this
very
--
very
important
questions
that
are
presented.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say
two
felonies?
were
they
two
counts
of
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
separate,
so
to
speak.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
but
they
were
--
were
they
at
the
same
time,
matter
about
the
same
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
court
could
put
her
in
jail
any
day
that
it
wanted
for
a
failure
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
either
to
pay
the
fine
or
to
comply
with
some
other
provision
of
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
of
the
probation,
could
he
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
and
that
three-year
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
period
has
not
run.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
this
is
not
the
case
in
which
the
judgment
was
expunged?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
judgment
was
expunged
in
the
forgery
case
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
which
is
the
predicate
for
this
action.
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
--
isn't
the
--
isn't
the
theory
of
the
--
of
the
state
act
different,
mr.
grey?
doesn't
the
--
in
the
first
place,
doesn't
the
--
then
the
state
act
provide
that
that
this
will
apply
only
to
people
who
are
convicted
in
the
state
of
california?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
it
in
here?
it
is
right
here,
any
person
who
since
the
first
day
of
july
1944
has
been
or
is
hereafter
convicted
in
the
state
of
california
of
the
offense
of
so
and
so
--
and
so
and
so.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
--
but
it
doesn't
apply
to
people
who
are
convicted,
let
us
say,
in
the
state
of
missouri
or
kansas
or
any
other
state
who
comes
there,
does
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
it,
in
another
section?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
may
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
haven't
read
it
for
some
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
grey,
do
you
have
any
idea
how
many
people
have
registered
in
los
angeles
and
what
percentage
of
those
who
--
who
should
register
have
registered?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
could
know
how
many
were
registered?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
many
would
that
be
in
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
your
county?
chief
justice
earl
warren
since
1933?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
that
be
more
than
a
very,
very
small
fraction
of
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
of
the
--
yes,
of
your
ex-convict
population?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i'm
just
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
knowing
the
size
--
knowing
the
size
of
los
angeles
county
itself
and
the
number
of
people
you
send
to
the
penitentiary
each
year
and
the
number
of
people
you've
placed
on
probation
for
felony
it
seems
to
me
to
be
infinitesimal.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
mr.
mcmorris
to
say
he
had
looked
into
that
--
that
matter
and
he
found
that
most
of
the
arrest
or
a
large
percentage
of
them,
police
were
--
where
arrest
had
been
made
as
an
afterthought,
not
--
not
where
they
were
arrested
for
--
on
investigation
for
having
violated
the
act,
but
where
they
had
been
brought
in
for
something
else
and
it
was
disclosed
at
that
time
that
they
--
that
they
had
been
in
jail
and
then
they
charged
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
grey,
do
i
understand
you
that
under
our
california
procedure
that
where
a
person
has
appealed
from
the
judgment
of
conviction
and
the
highest
appellate
court
has
reviewed
the
question
of
constitutionality
raised
by
him
and
has
decided
it
adversely
to
him
that
he
can
thereafter
go
into
the
court
on
the
writ
of
prohibition
and
set
aside
that
judgment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
has
here
made
that
determination
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
because
the
--
the
question
of
constitutionality
was
raised
on
appeal
according
to
--
to
your
court.
the
--
the
question
of
constitutionality
was
decided
against
the
petitioner,
it
became
final.
now,
does
our
california
procedure
authorize
reviewing
that
question
of
constitutionality
again
by
prohibition?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
may
be
very
important
in
this
case
mr.
grey
because
of
--
if
this
court
should
decide
that
there
--
there
is
a
state
remedy
that
of
prohibition
it
might
cause
--
we
send
--
send
it
back
to
the
state
of
california
and
it
would
hardly
be
a
fair
--
fair
thing
to
do
if
when
he
got
back
there,
we
found
that
prohibition
wasn't
the
proper
way
to
--
to
raise
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.

chief

chief

wasn't
there
something
in

she

for
suspicion

they
took

found
she's
been
convicted

charged

charged
her
with

isn't
there
--
wasn't
there
something
in

about

chief

yes.

mr.

chief

earl

did
they
raise
the
constitutional
question
at
that
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
was
argued,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
without
regard
whether
he
was
convicted
in
california
or
some
other
part
of
the
world.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief

the
specific,
to
take
the
blue

in

i
think,
they
--
they
are
so-called

misdemeanors.
chief

in

it's
a
felony.
if
the

was
violated,

and

was
convicted,
he'd
be
subject
to

when
he
came

mr.
grey,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
grey,
i
think
the
--
the
court
is
primarily
interested
in
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
and
we
would
like
to
have
you
direct
to
the
major
portion
of
your
argument
to
that
--
to
that
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
indeed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
in
that
--
in
that
restrict,
how
she
is
a
second
offender?
was
it
two
--
were
two
prosecutions
that
came
along
almost
simultaneously
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
it
wasn't
that
she
served
one
--
one
term
and
then
had
another
conviction,
was
it?
it
was
--
they
broke
up
a
series
of
--
of
forgeries
by
--
by
two
prosecutions
and
two
convictions.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice

normally
--
chief
justice

--
you
don't
call
those
second
offenders,
do
you?
chief

warren
yes,
i
--
i
understand.
it's
all
right.
i
--
i
won't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
won't
argue
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
--
didn't
you
answer
that
yesterday,
mr.
grey,
by
saying
that
it
made
no
difference
whether
was
in
california
or
in
any
other
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
and
under
the
interpretation
given
to
it
by
your
appellate
division
which
is
the
only
--
only
interpretation
has
been
given
to
it
by
the
courts.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
what
did
they
do
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
did
they
follow
that
policy
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
show
that
they
did?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
your
office
know
what
the
background
of
this
was?
what
--
how
--
how
she
happened
to
be
arrested
on
this
--
this
charge?
you
didn't
look
at
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
was
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
was
this
woman
arrested
under
any
search
circumstances?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
it
was
said
--
i
thought
it
was
said
the
last
argument
of
the
case
that
she
was
walking
along
the
street
going
to
work
or
--
or
something
of
that
kind
as
a
secretary
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
of
the
law
office
and
was
arrested
and
asked
to
show
her
--
her
arm
to
--
to
see
if
she
had
been
using
narcotics
and
on
a
failure
to
establish
that,
she
was
taken
up
and
charged
with
this
crime.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
now,
let
--
let
me
ask
you
this,
mr.
grey.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
39
arrest
in
one
year
in
that
great
city
of
los
angeles,
in
the
great
county
of
los
angeles
would
make
it
look
that
--
as
though
this
was
only
used
when
it
would
serve
a
particular
purpose.
now,
you
have
thousands
of
men
every
year
arrested
in
los
angeles
county
for
--
for
a
crime
of
various
kinds.
you
have
many,
many
thousands
more
arrested
in
your
--
in
your
county.
you
have
many
thousands
of
--
of
ex-convicts,
i'm
sure,
who
go
through
your
state
in
--
or
your
city
in
the
course
of
a
--
of
a
year,
a
city
of
two
and
a
quarter
million,
county
of
almost
5,000,000
people
and
still,
there
are
only
39
arrests,
and
--
and
this
particular
woman
is
one
of
them.
now,
isn't
that
a
rather
strange
enforcement
of
the
--
the
law
and
--
and
many
of
these
thousands
that
i
speak
of
are
--
are
very
bad
criminals
and
many
of
them
are
not
convicted
of
a
--
of
the
major
offense,
why
is
it
that
there
are
only
39
arrest
for
this
crime
in
one
year?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
wait
a
minute,
wait
a
minute.
let's
--
let's
take
that
number
right
there.
i
noticed
that
too
and
that
struck
me
significant.
you've
had
43,313
register
as
of
july
10th,
1957.
now,
that
covers
what
period?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
long
has
it
been
in
existence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
that's
a
large
number
in
view
of
that?
doesn't
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
strikes
me
as
being
a
very
small
number.certainly,
you
have
convicted,
you've
convicted
more
people
of
--
of
crimes
punishable
as
a
felony
in
los
angeles
city
alone
in
that
length
of
time,
haven't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
only
reason
i
asked
you
this
is
because
43,000
registered
in
that
time
and
only
39
arrest
in
the
years.
it
strikes
me.
is
--
it's
not
a
uniform
method
of
--
of
enforcement.
i
--
i
know
that
great
city
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
there
any
regulations
of
the
police
department
requiring
the
giving
of
notes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
who
fixed
that
policy?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
any
of
it
in
writing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right,
go
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
mr.
linn.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
on
the
other
hand
this
is
hardly
in
conformity
with
the
--
on
the
bare
facts
that
we
have
here
of
the
policy
that
--
that
mr.
grey
would
--
would
have
us
understand
it's
the
policy
of
the
department
in
--
in
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
a
ruckus?
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
show
there
was?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
do
you
weird
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
do
you
weird
about
it
if
there
was
a
ruckus
point?
and
that
was
the
reason,
why
not
say
so?
but
why
infer
that
there
was
a
ruckus?
i
don't
know
if
there
was
a
ruckus.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
does
it
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
and
that's
what
you
referred
to
as
a
ruckus?
chief
justice
earl
warren
pardon
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
all
i
just
want
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
linn,
you
spoke
of
the
department
of
corrections
and
the
--
the
instructions
they
give
all
their
parolees.
this
one
--
she
was
never
under
the
jurisdiction
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
of
the
department
correction,
was
she?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
he
was
--
that's
only
for
state
--
state
institutions.
chief
justice
earl
warren
she
wasn't
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
--
now,
let's
just
--
just
go
into
that
a
bit.
there
are
47
other
counties
in
the
state
beside
--
besides
los
angeles.
and
there
are
thousands,
tens
of
thousands
every
year
who
were
convicted
of
crimes
that
are
denominated
the
felony
but
who
get
misdemeanor
punishments
and
who
do
not
go
to
the
state
institutions
nor
are
they
in
anyway
subject
to
the
policies
of
--
of
the
county
of
los
angeles
probation
department.
those
people
don't
get
any
notice
about
--
about
the
--
about
the
ordinance
in
los
angeles,
do
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
saying
mr.
linn
--
the
only
reason
i
said
that
was
because
you
said
that
took
care
all
of
those
in
california
and
--
and
it
doesn't
take
care
of
but
a
minority
of
them.
now,
in
addition
to
that,
this
case
goes
back
to
--
this
statute
goes
back
to
1921.
a
man
could
have
committed
a
crime
when
he
is
21
years
of
age
at
that
time
and
could
be
58
years
old
now.
and
i'm
sure
at
that
time,
there
was
no
such
policy
to
--
either
in
los
angeles
or
in
the
state
corrections
department
or
in
any
county
of
the
state
of
notifying
them
of
anything
but
they
are
--
but
they
are
under
this
act,
aren't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
how
would
all
those
people
--
would
all
those
people
know?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know
--
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
was
just
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
was
just
addressing
myself
to
your
statement
that
that
took
care
of
all
--
all
of
them
in
california.
it's
only
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
may
be
a
liable
on
los
angeles.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
may
be
a
liable
on
los
angeles.
[laughs]
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
mr.
linn,
let's
--
let's
just
examine
those
two.
it
happened
that
somebody
do
that
as
you
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
the
first
place,
the
registration
of
sex
offenders
says,
“any
person
who,
since
the
first
day
of
july
1944,”
and
this
act
was
enacted
a
year
or
so
afterwards.
this
act
--
this
ordinance
goes
back
to
1921.
and
as
to
some
of
these
offenses
in
--
in
here,
it
says,
“any
person
who,
after
the
first
day
of
august
1950,
does
so
and
so,
and
so
and
so.”
so
the
--
the
--
your
statement
that
a
person
having
done
something
when
he
was
a
boy
and
is
now
40
years
old
had
to
register
under
this
act
isn't
--
isn't
entirely
accurate
because
there
hadn't
been
enough
elapsed
time
for
that
to
happen.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
is
this
date
--
what
does
this
date
refer
to?
any
person
who,
since
the
1st
day
of
july
1944,
has
been
or
he's
hereafter
convicted
in
the
state
of
california
the
--
of
the
offense
of
assault
would
intend
to
commit
rape
with
the
infamous
crime
against
nature
or
any
offense
involving
lewd
and
lascivious
conduct
or
any
person
and
so
forth
who
fails
to
register.
that's
only
since
1944.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
would
--
how
would
that
affect
a
man
who
is
--
had
such
an
arrest
when
he
was
17
years
old
and
is
now
over
40?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
--
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
bad.
chief
justice
earl
warren
[laughs]
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
all
i
was
pointing
out.
that's
[laughs]
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
[laughs]
chief
justice
earl
warren
his
fingerprints
would
have
shown
that,
wouldn't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
can‘t
put
a
man
in
jail
because
his
fingerprints
are
not
here
in
washington
or
--
or
in
sacramento
bureau
criminal
identification
and
here,
you
put
him
in
jail.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
continues
long
as
he
lives?
chief
justice
earl
warren
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
does
it
stop?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but,
mr.
linn,
isn't
that
only
a
notation
on
his
record,
his
--
his
fingerprints
and
his
pictures
remain
in
that
bureau
forevermore
and
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
man
is
--
if
the
man
is
ever
checked
again,
his
--
his
fingerprints
and
his
pictures
show
up,
and
wouldn't
it
be
exactly
the
same
thing
in
the
registration
under
this
ordinance,
if
the
man
registered
and
was
a
probationer
and
his
--
his
conviction
was
expunged
still,
forevermore,
there
would
be
this
picture
and
this
registration
of
him
in
the
--
in
the
bureau
there
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
where
such
police
uses
as
they
may
desire
to
make
of
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
--
but,
mr.
linn,
aren't
we
dealing
with
another
thing
there?
your
--
your
prints
are
taken
as
an
operation
of
law.
when
a
man
is
arrested,
his
fingerprints
are
taken,
he
is
photographed
and
that
goes
through
the
--
the
state
bureau
of
criminal
identification
to
the
fbi
and
is
distributed
throughout
the
--
throughout
the
country.
now,
in
this
case,
however,
you're
--
you're
adding
an
additional
burden
to
the
man.
you
are
saying,
“if
you
don't,
yourself,
go
there
and
register
yourself,
we'll
put
you
in
jail.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
that's
an
entirely
different
thing,
it
seems
to
me,
from
keeping
the
photographs
and
the
--
and
the
fingerprints
in
these
various
bureaus.
there's
no
crime
involved
in
--
in
that.
but
here,
you
make
it
a
penal
offense
for
a
man
not
to
--
not
to
register
and
regardless
of
where
he
comes
from
in
the
country,
regardless
of
how
long
ago
it
was,
regardless
of
how
he
--
he
may
have
rehabilitated
himself
and
you
--
still
you
could
put
him
in
jail
for
not
registering.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
difference,
isn't
it,
between
the
two?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
that
hasn't
--
that
isn't
here
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
i
have
no
doubt
but
it
isn't
here
--
it
isn't
here
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
would
think
so.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
do
that
briefly
will
you
please,
mr.
linn?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but,
mr.
linn,
aren't
you
--
aren't
you
also
requiring
them
to
register
for
crimes
that
are
malum
prohibitum
as
distinguished
from
malum.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
the
felonies
that
--
some
of
the
felonies
--
some
of
the
acts
that
we
recognize
as
felonies
in
our
state
are
malum
prohibitum
and
not
malum
in
se,
isn't
it
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
instance
let's
take
the
--
the
(inaudible).
that's
not
malum
in
se,
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
--
i
think
our
court
said
it's
malum
prohibitum.
i
may
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
may
be
wrong.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
think
the
mere
--
the
mere
selling
of
those
securities
in
our
state
whether
you
have
any
intent
to
violate
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
i
--
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
my
recollection.
i
may
be
--
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
all
right,
mr.
mcmorris.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
mr.
christopher,
if
you
would
like
to
have
five
minutes
in
which
to
sum
up
your
views
as
friend
of
the
court,
i'd
be
very
happy
to
hear
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
now,
mr.
christopher
and
mr.
mcmorris,
i
--
i
would
thank
you,
on
behalf
of
the
court
for
having
represented
this
--
this
woman
without
compensation,
you,
mr.
christopher,
for
acting
as
a
friend
of
the
court
in
the
case.
we
are
always
reassured
when
counsels
are
willing
to
give
their
time
and
--
and
effort
in
this
--
in
this
manner.
you
rendered
a
real
public
service.
gentlemen,
i
--
i
want
to
thank
both
of
you
for
the
earnest
way
in
which
you
have
represented
the
city
of
los
angeles
and
state
of
california.
