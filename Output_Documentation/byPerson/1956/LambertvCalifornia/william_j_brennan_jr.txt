justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
grey,
what's
the
proceeding
in
the
appellate
court?
is
it
a
--
where
the
appeal
is
entertained
as
an
appeal
from
the
conviction?
is
it
a
new
trial
on
the
record
or
what
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
which
you
mean
what?is
it
just
a
review
of
the
points
of
law
or
is
there
a
redetermination
on
the
record
of
the
fact
or
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
did
you
have
to
do,
assign
error
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you'll
be
heard
only
--
you'll
be
heard
only
on
the
points
then
raised,
what,
in
your
statement
on
appeal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now
--
now,
what
precisely
were
raised
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
grey,
are
you
making
any
argument
here
that
we
ought
not
entertain
this
appeal
because
either
habeas
corpus
or
prohibition
or
some
other
method
was
not
sought
to
obtain
a
determination
under
california
supreme
court
or
district
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr
grey,
getting
on
the
same
question
in
the
ordinance.
did
i
understand
that
looking
at
page
2
of
your
appendix,
subdivision
(d),
those
references
are
all
to
felonies
that
is
under
the
penal
code
of
california,
264,
265,
266
and
so
forth?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
getting
to
--
i'm
looking
at
subdivision
(d)
at
page
2
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
and
do
i
understand
that
the
test
of
obligation
to
register
is
not
whether
in
the
--
when
the
--
the
offenses
committed
outside
the
state,
is
not
whether
it
was
a
misdemeanor
or
a
felony
or
whatever
classification
it
may
have
--
is
put
under
in
the
state
of
conviction?
the
test
is
whether
in
california
it
would
have
been
a
violation
of
one
these
sections?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
is
that
to
say,
for
example,
an
offense
may
use
in
extreme
instance
be
disorderly
person's
offense
in
some
other
state
and
yet
if
your
code
makes
it
a
felony
then
he's
on
notice
that
he
has
to
register
under
this
order?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
event
--
well,
it
may
be
but
i
know
in
my
own
state
be
downgraded
a
lot
of
misdemeanors
to
disorderly
person's
offenses,
and
i'm
just
wondering
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
the
person
convicted
in
another
state
at
his
peril
must
know
whether
or
not
his
offense
is
or
isn't
a
felony
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
california.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
he
doesn't
have
that
information
or
isn't
a
lawyer
enough
to
know
whether
it
is
or
not,
he
may
be
subjected
to
conviction
under
this
order.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
for
example,
in
my
state
we
don't
know
anything
by
named
felony.
is
there
--
it's
either
a
high
misdemeanor,
a
misdemeanor
or
disorderly
persons.
no
such
thing
as
a
felony.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
would
be
pretty
--
it
would
be
pretty
tough
on
the
charge
wouldn't
it
to
know
that
the
penal
code
of
california
264,
265,
286
or
something
covered
as
a
felony,
an
offense
which
were
commit
--
committed
was
nothing
worst
than
the
misdemeanor
or
a
disorderly
person.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
christopher,
before
you
take
up
that
point.
what
is
the
size
of
the
category
of
felony
under
california
law
by
which
i
mean
is
it
a
sizeable
number
of
felonies
which
are
crimes
which
are
made
felonies
under
california
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
for
example,
in
my
home
state
of
new
jersey,
the
difference
between
a
misdemeanor
and
a
high
misdemeanor,
we
don't
call
them
felonies
but
high
misdemeanor,
is
whether
punishment
is
three
years
or
less.
i
gather
that
many
misdemeanants
punished
in
new
jersey
who
may
find
their
way
to
california
would
be,
by
california
law,
persons
who
have
been
convicted
under
--
according
to
california
law
of
appellant,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
connection,
mr.
christopher,
perhaps
we
ought
to
wait
there.
mr.
linn
is,
but
as
i
recall,
the
statistic
you've
been
given,
some
43,000
registration,
i
think,
under
this
ordinance,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
--
do
you
know
whether
this
man,
he
break
down
to
that
to
show
how
many
of
the
registrants
are
those
who
have
been
convicted
of
crimes
outside
of
california?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
perhaps
mr.
linn
might
be
thinking
that
over
before
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
christopher,
have
you
any
comment
about
the
suggestion
that
appears
in
the
state's
brief
that
across
some
papers,
copies
of
probation
papers
or
something
was
a
handwritten
legend
told
to
register
or
something
like
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
were
the
forgeries
for
which
she
was
convicted?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
were
the
forgeries
for
which
she
was
convicted?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
she
convicted
of
forgery?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
forging
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
that
over
a
long
period
of
time
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
over
a
period
of
a
month?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where?
in
los
angeles?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
(inaudible)
this
ordinance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
it
was
made
by
the
statute.
it's
made
by
the
statute
(inaudible)
even
though
it
might
also
a
misdemeanor
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
isn't
it
a
fact
that
someone
convicted
of
a
crime
in
some
other
state
punishable
under
the
laws
of
that
state
(inaudible)
would
be
under
the
laws
of
california
for
the
(inaudible)
person
convicted
of
felony?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
state
prison
in
california
that
individual
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
that
felony
class
is
under
california
law.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
i
understand
that
correctly,
mr.
grey,
is
that
to
say
then
that
a
person
who
has
been
convicted
of
a
crime
and
interrogated
in
the
manner
you
suggested
is
not
prosecuted
then
and
there
for
having
failed
to
register
but
as
warned
first
that
one
must
register?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
though,
mr.
grey,
the
rest
of
the
answer
to
six,
there's
no
record
of
the
number
of
instances
where
ex-convicts
have
been
questioned
taken
to
the
record
division
for
registry
and
later
release
based
upon
the
personal
experience
of
the
officer's
questions,
the
question
there
had
been
many
times
more
cases
of
this
type
that
of
actual
bookings
in
this
charge.
that
implies
though
there'd
been
a
substantial
number
of
bookings
without
a
prior
up
to
newly
registers,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
as
--
this
says
actual
bookings
on
this
charge.
i'm
meaning
at
the
top
of
page
9.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
answer
you
referred
us
to.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
the
fact
it
appears
to
be
that
in
many
cases
at
least,
however,
many
doesn't
very
clearly
appear,
they'll
book
someone
in
a
--
well,
if
it
is
established
that
he
has
been
convicted
of
a
crime,
he
has
failed
to
register
and
will
be
prosecuted
for
having
failed
to
register.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
a
misdemeanor
committed
in
his
presence
that
is
a
failure
to
register?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
--
what's
that
mean,
mr.
linn?
suppose
he
is
registered
--has
registered
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
under
this
ordinance,
are
you
telling
us
that
when
the
record
is
expunged,
the
expunging
includes
the
registration?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
he's
been
registered.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
happens
to
the
record
of
that
registration?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
--
i
don't
follow.
no.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
he
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
has
--
he
has
registered,
and
i
take
it,
the
registry
takes
the
form
of
a
card
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
with
his
picture
and
all
the
rest,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
he's
had
--
the
record,
i
gather,
the
offense
and
the
procedures
related
to
the
offense
has
been
expunged
in
the
court
of
record
where
it
was
entered,
is
that
it?
now,
who
goes
to
the
police
station
and
takes
the
card
out
and
rips
it
up
or
otherwise
expunges
the
card?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
tell
me,
mr.
linn,
i
gather
california
provides
no
expunging
procedure
as
to
those
who've
been
convicted
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
outside
the
state,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
they
are
subject
always
to
registry.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me.
is
--
does
this
expunging
procedure
apply
also
to
convictions
under
this
ordinance?
in
other
words,
can
this
lady
ever
have
this
conviction
expunged?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
this
a
record
that
will
be
there
forever,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
she's
been
convicted
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
of
this
violation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
record
stands
even
though
later
on
perhaps
the
felony
convictions
may
be
expunged?
