justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
this
proceeding,
however,
did
you
say
to
vacate,
to
just
--
you
say
that
the
judgment
of
probation
must
be
vacated
if
the
period
is
served
without
violation?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
isn't
it
true
that
has
to
be
done
only
upon
application
of
the
accused?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
if
that
so,
would
that
not
have
a
bearing
on
the
question
raised
by
mr.
justice
black,
as
to
the
date
of
the
effectiveness
of
that
action?
she
has
to
apply
and
the
courts,
under
no
duty
to
act
to
vacate
the
sentence
until
there
is
the
application.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
of
course,
in
that
case
as
i
understood
you
a
while
ago
that
when
she
came
in
and
voluntarily
took
herself
off
probation,
and
surrendered
herself
for
jail
service,
the
court
then
imposed
this
six
months
sentence
and
then
she
was
no
longer
a
probationer.
you
couldn't
expunge
that
record,
could
you?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
but
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
it
could
not
be
sir
an
application
for
a
prohibition
against
the
issuance
of
execution
on
that
fine.
this
is
a
fine
that's
subject
to
execution.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
wouldn't
that
be
a
means
of
reaching
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
grey,
i
--
i
still
am
not
quite
clear
on
this
proposition.
you
stated
a
while
ago
that
a
--
in
answer
to
a
question
of
mine
that
the
issuance
of
execution
on
this
$250
fine
would
call
only
for
a
--
the
rendition
of
a
ministerial
act
by
the
clerk.
is
it
not
true
however
that
that
judgment
is
the
judgment
of
the
court?
and
is
it
not
therefore
one
subject
to
prohibition
that
is
the
exudations
of
execution
may
be
prohibited
in
an
--
by
a
writ
of
prohibition
in
the
district
court
of
appeals?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
that's
all
over
the
board
now.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
that's
left
is
the
judgment
of
the
court
and
execution
can
issue
on
it.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
isn't
it
final
except
to
this
field?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
if
--
if
this
were
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes,
but
if
that
were
off,
execution
could
issue
tomorrow?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
that's
one
--
that's
one
way
to
do
it.
but
is
that
the
only
way
to
do
it?
couldn't
the
execution
issue
on
the
judgment?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
other
words
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
take
the
position
that
no
fine
is
yet
imposed?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
maybe
if
there
is
a
default
in
the
conditions
of
prohibition.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
you
please
answer
--
i'm
still
troubled
by
this.
and
also
mr.
grey,
if
there
is
no
fine
existing
out
there
now
but
there
only
maybe
one
and
the
probation
is
all
over,
what's
here?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
there's
no
fine
here,
no
probation
here,
what
shall
we
act
on?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
wouldn't
--
but
--
but
according
to
counsel's
argument
there
may
be
a
fine
levied
on
her.
there
may
not
be,
there
is
none
now.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
there
is
a
fine
now
then
it
could
be
prohibited
by
an
original
writ
in
the
court
of
appeals,
wouldn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
if
there
is
none,
then
what's
here?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
understood
the
implication
of
your
argument
(inaudible)
he
shouldn't
judge
the
constitutionality
of
this
act
because
it's
(inaudible)
that
in
this
case.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
linn
may
i
ask
you,
sir?
what
had
you
to
say
as
to
whether
or
not
this
case
is
properly
here?
i
understand
from
counsel
for
petitioner
that
as
far
as
they
could
go
as
of
right
was
the
court
of
appeals.
is
--
i
ask
you
now,
is
there
a
discretionary
right
to
go
to
the
supreme
court
of
california?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
none
at
all?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
concede
then,
as
i
understand
it
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
that
the
petitioner
exhausted
for
legal
remedies
under
the
law
of
california.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
goes
there
from
a
penal
institution
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
in
california.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
what
about
someone,
using
the
example
yesterday,
coming
from
new
jersey?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
isn't
that
somewhat
of
a
different
question?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
why
i
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
mcmorris.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
contend
there
are
exceptions
to
the
rule
that
all
persons
are
presumed
to
know
the
law?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
how
would
you
enforce
the
law
if
it
depended
upon
subjective
matter
of
whether
or
not
the
person
that
you
were
just
presumed
or
not
to
know
that
there
is
a
law?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
do
you
contend
that
such
offer
of
proof
could
have
appropriately
come
after
the
verdict
and
upon
the
motion
in
arrest?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
how
else
could
you
enforce
the
law?
just
tell
me
now.
if,
in
a
prosecution,
the
--
all
the
defendant
had
to
say
was,
“well,
maybe
all
you
say
is
true
but
i
was
ignorant.
that's
an
excuse.
hence,
i
didn't
know
that
that
was
the
law.”
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
that
might
be
in
a
particular
case
but
it
is
a
general
proposition.
it
will
be
open
where
you
had
no
such
commitment
from
the
defendant
that
he
didn't
know.
it
would
be
open
to
him,
would
it
not,
simply
to
say
“all
the
prosecution
may
say
is
true
yet,
i
was
ignorant
of
it
and
therefore,
you'd
have
to
discharge
me.”
is
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
don't
you
get
down
actually
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there's
reasonable
relationship
between
this
ordinance
requiring
registration
and
the
purpose
for
which
registration
may
be
required?
as
i
indicated
they
are
suggested
to
counsel
for
the
state.
clearly,
it
would
seem
to
me,
that
in
narcotics
and
sex
offender
cases,
there
is
such
reasonable
relationship
between
a
registration
ordinance
and
the
offense
as
to
make
it
reasonably
sound,
but
when
you
make
it
general
to
cover
all
possible
offenses
wherever
committed,
that
might
have
been
regarded
as
felonies
in
california,
then
you
got
a
different
question,
haven't
you?
