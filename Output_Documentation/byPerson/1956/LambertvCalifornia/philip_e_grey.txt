mr.
philip
e.
grey
may
it
please
this
court.
some
time
in
the
1930's,
the
city
of
los
angeles
passed
the
ordinance
here
in
question.
in
substance,
it
requires
all
persons
who
had
previously
been
convicted
of
a
felony
whether
in
the
state
of
california
or
elsewhere
if
the
crime
were
punishable
in
california
as
a
felony,
certain
types
of
misdemeanors
to
register
within
five
days
after
they
came
to
the
city
of
los
angeles
intending
to
reside
there.
they
also
provided
in
that
ordinance
that
persons
who
did
not
reside
in
the
city,
who,
during
a
30-day
period
came
into
the
city
more
than
five
days
should
register
if
they
have
in
fact
been
convicted
of
a
felony.
they
also
provided
that
persons
who
moved
were
required
to
give
their
notice
or
change
of
address.
the
statute
defined
convicted
person
as
those
who
had
been
convicted,
as
i
heretofore
stated,
of
a
felony
in
california
or
a
crime
which
would
have
been
punishable
at
--
a
felony
if
committed
in
the
state
of
california.
it
also
provided
that
persons
who
had
accepted
the
provisions
of
the
probation
law
and
whose
records
were
expunged
upon
a
satisfactory
showing
of
fulfilling
their
terms
and
conditions
of
probation
were
thereafter
not
deemed
to
be
convicted
persons
so
that
they
would
not
thereafter
be
required
to
register.
they
enacted
another
subdivision
which
enumerated
certain
specific
types
of
crimes
dealing
with
sex
violations,
rapes,
assault
with
intent
to
commit
rape,
indecent
exposure,
delude
and
dissolute
misdemeanor
types
of
crimes.
and
they
provided
that
those
persons
who
came
within
that
subdivision
(d),
even
though
their
records
had
been
expunged
under
the
probation
laws,
were
still
deemed
to
be
convicted
persons
so
that
there
would
be
the
requirement
that
they
register
in
addition.
this
appellant,
however,
only
comes
under
the
first
classification,
a
person
who
had
been
convicted
of
a
felony.
the
facts
as
i
see
them
are
these.
a
verified
complaint
was
filed
in
the
municipal
court
of
the
los
angeles
judicial
district,
charging
appellant
with
having
violated
subdivision
(a)
of
section
5239
of
the
los
angeles
municipal
code,
charging
that
she
had
in
fact
been
convicted
of
two
prior
felonies,
forgeries.
that
she
had
lived
and
remained
in
the
city
of
los
angeles
for
more
than
the
five-day
period.
that
her
record
of
conviction
had
not
been
expunged
and
that
she
did
not
register
as
required
by
the
ordinance.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
no.
as
i
understand
the
record,
two
separate
case
numbers.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
two
separate
numbers.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
as
far
as
the
record
indicates
i
think
that
they
were
very
close.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
one
was
in
may
and
one
was
in
june
or
something
like
that.
very
close.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
all
persons
convicted
are
required
to
register,
all
persons
who
live
in
the
city
of
los
angeles.
the
full
sections
of
the
code
are
set
forth
in
my
appendix
here.
they
did
start
on
the
day
such
as
january
1st,
1921
to
bring
the
thing
--
or
these
terms
of
the
ordinance
up-to-date.
those
persons,
who,
subsequent
to
january
1st,
1921
had
been
convicted.
in
any
event
this
complaint
was
filed.
appellant
was
arraigned.
they
chose
to
file
a
demurrer
to
the
complaint.
at
that
time
constitutional
issues
were
raised,
amongst
those
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional,
that
there
was
an
abuse
of
the
process
of
the
court,
unlawful
search
and
seizure.
of
course
at
that
time
on
the
hearing
of
the
demurrer
only
the
constitutional
issues
were
raised
and
considered,
whether
the
ordinance
on
its
face
was
an
invalid
police
regulation,
matters
of
evidence
were
not
gone
into.
the
demurrer
was
overruled.
the
matter
--
plea
of
not
guilty
was
entered.
the
matter
was
set
for
trial.
at
the
time
of
trial
a
jury
was
selected
and
before
the
trial
actually
got
started
i
think
the
court
noticed
that
there
was
a
mistake
in
the
date.
we
called
counsel
to
the
bench
and
discussed
the
matter
with
them
and
granted
leave
to
file
an
amended
complaint.
an
amended
complaint
was
thereafter
filed
correcting
the
date.
i
think
that
occurred
on
two
occasions.
before
the
introduction
of
evidence,
counsel
for
appellant
again
urged
the
constitutional
grounds
and
also
urged
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures,
police
brutality,
and
anything
else
that
came
to
mind.
the
court
merely
passing
on
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute
overruled
the
objection
to
the
introduction
of
evidence
and
the
matter
proceeded
to
trial
on
the
second
amended
complaint.
when
witnesses
for
the
people
were
called,
they
called
the
clerk
of
a
superior
court
as
i
recall
and
introduced
certified
copies
of
these
judgements
of
convictions
of
the
felonies
for
forgery.
they
were
introduced.
thereafter,
witnesses
were
called
to
prove
that
the
defendant
or
that
the
appellant
was
a
resident
of
the
city
of
los
angeles.
upon
the
calling
of
the
witness,
it
was
stipulated
that
the
appellant
was
a
resident
of
the
city
of
los
angeles
for
the
time
charged
in
the
complaint,
in
fact
for
seven
and
a
half
year
period.
thereafter,
when
a
witness
was
called
to
show
that
the
records
of
the
convictions
of
felonies
had
not
been
expunged,
it
was
stipulated
that
that
was
true,
that
these
records
had
not
been
expunged
at
the
time
of
the
arrest.
when
--
i
think
each
and
everyone
of
the
elements
to
that
extent
were
offered
to
be
proved
by
the
people.
there
was
the
stipulation.
the
people
then
rested.
the
defendant
or
appellant
then
offered
evidence.
some
of
it
was
admitted,
some
was
objected
to.
the
net
result
was
that
she
testified
that
she
didn't
know
whether
or
not
she
had
been
convicted
of
a
felony
because
at
the
time
of
sentence
she
fainted.
but
she
does
--
did
recall
reading
of
the
charges
and
that
she
was
present
when
the
court
imposed
the
sentence.
there
was
some
cross-examination
as
to
her
hearing
the
charges,
knowing
that
they
were
forgeries.
these
matters
of
course
went
to
credibility
of
her
knowledge
of
whether
she
was
in
fact
convicted
of
a
felony.
thereafter,
the
jury
was
orally
instructed
and
they
returned
a
verdict
of
guilt.
after
the
jury
returned
its
verdict,
appellant
made
a
motion
for
dismissal
in
the
interest
of
justice.
he
raised
the
contention
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient
to
sustain
the
charge.
he
also
said
that
the
defendant
was
only
technically
guilty
of
this
offense,
because
she
had
a
right
to
have
her
record
expunged
and
i
think
at
that
time
he
asserted
that
she
did
actually
have
the
record
expunged.
and
he
further
contented
that
this
was
vindicating
the
action
of
two
police
officers.
this
motion
was
denied.
thereafter,
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgement
was
made.
in
this
motion,
in
arrest
of
judgement,
it
was
urged
that
this
statute
was
unconstitutional
in
violation
of
the
spirit
of
the
federal
constitution
and
of
the
state
constitution.
that
it
was
an
improper
police
regulation.
that
it
misused
in
this
particular
case,
voided
the
judgement.
that
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
vindicating
the
will
of
two
officers
and
he
at
that
time
offered
to
prove
the
facts
concerning
the
arrest.
he
offered
at
that
time
to
show
that
she
was
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
street.
her
sleeves
were
rolled
up.
she
was
looked
--
they
were
looking
for
narcotics
and
some
other
reason,
and
that
she
was
thereafter
arrested,
not
being
told
why
she
was
arrested.
he
offered
to
prove
that
the
counsel
was
present
at
the
time
that
the
officers
would
not
allow
him
to
talk
to
the
appellant,
and
that
later
these
charges
were
then
filed.
i
have
pointed
out
in
my
brief
and
appended
thereto
the
statute
which
authorizes
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgement.
that
motion
is
addressed
solely
to
the
phase
of
the
accusatory
pleading,
and
at
that
time
you
may
question
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute.
it
is
not
the
same
as
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
it
only
goes
to
the
validity
of
the
accusatory
pleading
itself.
that
motion
was
then
denied
properly
by
the
court.
an
appeal
--
at
that
time
the
court
imposed
sentence.
the
sentence
was
as
follows,
imposition
of
sentence
suspended
for
three
years
which
is
a
method
of
granting
probation.
the
defendant
placed
on
probation
for
that
length
--
period
of
time
on
condition
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes.
one
of
the
conditions
that
she
do
not
violate
any
other
laws,
health
and
moral
laws
that
she
pay
a
fine
of
$250.
then
the
appeal
was
taken
under
california
procedure
a
defendant
may
appeal
from
an
order
denying
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
from
a
final
judgement
of
conviction,
from
an
order
of
granting
or
denying
probation,
or
from
an
order
made
after
judgement
affecting
substantial
rights
of
a
defendant.
in
this
case,
the
appellants
appealed
from
a
final
judgement
of
conviction
and
the
briefs
were
filed
in
the
appellate
department,
and
it
was
pointed
out
by
the
respondent
that
in
this
case
there
was
no
final
judgement
of
conviction
but
an
order
granting
probation.
we
find
the
words
that
have
been
heretofore
alluded
to
mentioned
in
the
opinion
of
the
appellate
department,
rather
than
dismiss
the
appeal
they
said
we
will
consider
this
as
properly
before
the
court.
it
was
--
the
appeal
was
taken
from
a
final
judgement
of
conviction
where
there
had
been
no
final
judgement
of
conviction
entered
and
there
is
a
right
to
appeal
from
that
probationary
order.
so
that
then
followed.
the
appellate
department
of
the
superior
court
is
the
court
of
last
resort
in
these
cases
and
appeals
from
municipal
and
inferior
courts.
there
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
surely,
sir.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
is
that
the
(inaudible)
case
that
they
mention?
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
to
the
supreme
court.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes,
you
can.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes,
your
honor.
may
i
advice
the
court
about
this
(inaudible)
case.
it
was
a
similar
situation
as
this.
he
was
charged
with
being
an
ex-convict.
who
had
come
into
the
city
of
los
angeles
and
failed
to
register.
he
was
convicted.
he
took
an
appeal
to
the
appellate
department
of
the
superior
court.
the
judgement
of
conviction
was
affirmed.
he
was
then
remanded
into
this
custody
of
the
city
jail.
i
can't
recall
the
length
of
time.
while
in
jail
he
sued
out
a
writ
in
the
district
court
of
appeal
upon
a
new
theory,
not
based
upon
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
but
upon
the
form
of
the
complaint
itself.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
he
did
not
raise
the
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
his
legal
basis
was
because
of
substance
of
a
form
of
the
complaint.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
rather
than
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
no,
it
will.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
it
will
issue.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes,
definitely.
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
no.
no,
it
is
a
review
of
the
record.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
it
is
a
review
of
points
of
law,
a
completely
appellate
division.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
you
may
proceed.
you
must
have
a
statement
on
appeal
setting
forth
your
grounds
and
your
record,
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
and
there
is
no
trial
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
on
your
statement
on
appeal
set
forth
in
your
grounds
of
appeal
or
pertinent
to
the
proper
review.
on
an
appeal
from
a
final
judgment
of
conviction,
all
errors
from
the
time
of
the
trial
through
the
conclusion
are
considered.
on
the
appeal
from
your
motion
--
order
denying
a
motion
for
new
trial,
only
those
points
urged
on
the
motion
are
considered.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
similar
grounds
that
are
raised
before
this
court,
constitutionality
and
so
forth.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes.
yes,
they
were.
they
were
raised
on
the
same
fashion
that
we
have
before
this
court.
the
brief
was
practically
identically
sent.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
no.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes,
he
did.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
he
raised
them
properly,
and
they
were
all
considered.
and
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
only
one
sentence
in
that
opinion
is
devoted
to
the
constitutional
question,
and
that
sentence
reads
as
follows,
there
is
no
merit
to
the
claim
that
the
ordinance
is
unconstitutional.
the
other
matters
were
devoted
primarily
to
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
and
the
court
pointed
out
that
everyone
of
the
facts
essential
to
the
proper
conviction
of
the
charge
before
the
court
were
undisputedly
shown
in
the
record.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes,
it
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
no,
it
would
not.
if
the
petitioner
is
in
custody,
habeas
corpus
is
the
remedy
to
pursue.
the
appellate
department
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
oh,
yes.
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
that
is
true.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
that's
true.
the
appellate
department
is
--
it
is
by
the
judicial
council
rules
considered
the
court
of
last
resort
on
direct
appeals,
both
civil
and
criminal
from
municipal
and
other
inferior
courts.
another
way
of
attacking
that
would
be
by
a
writ
of
prohibition.
that
has
been
the
new
theory
of
seeking
out
a
writ
to
prohibit
the
court
from
rendering
a
decision.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
in
the
district
court
of
appeals
primarily.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
oh,
i
don't
believe
i
can
very
well
because
she
was
not
in
custody
at
any
time.
she
was
released
on
bail
pending
the
appeal,
and
the
--
there
was
only
a
fine
--
payment
of
a
fine
imposed
rather
than
a
jail
sentence.
now,
had
the
fine
not
been
paid
and
the
court
revoked
probation
and
then
thereafter
imposed
a
jail
sentence,
habeas
corpus
would
have
been
available,
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
no.
no,
it
does
not.
we
have
felt
that
this
is
a
proper
police
regulation,
and
i
think
that
that
trying
to
decipher
the
issues
of
this
case,
i
think
that
is
the
sole
question.
is
this
type
of
an
ordinance
constitutional?
we
feel
that
is
it
a
--
it
is
a
reasonable
police
regulation.
i
have
attempted
to
point
out
other
registration
ordinances
wherein
there
has
been
a
declaration
that
it
isn't
a
proper
police
regulation,
the
alien
registration
act.
the
courts
have
said
that
the
states
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
this
hines
versus
davidowitz
appears
that
the
courts
indicate
that
the
state
is
entitled
to
know
who
is
present,
where
they
are.
the
lobbyist
registration
act
i
have
pointed
to
that
in
my
brief.
i
have
covered
the
waging
business
registration.
i
have
also
alluded
to
the
foreign
agents
registration
act,
and
some
of
the
other
city
ordinances
which
require
taxi
cab
drivers
to
register
with
the
police
department,
those
who
sell
newspapers.
and
the
courts
have
consistently
said
the
city
is
entitled
to
know
so
that
they
can
keep
track
of
those
types
of
people.
we
feel
that
the
ordinance
does
not
require
that
any
person
give
any
information
which
is
incriminated.
the
information
sought
is
just,
is
he
present
in
the
city?
where
does
he
live?
has
he
been
convicted
of
a
crime
in
the
past?
what
were
the
natures
of
those
crimes?
they
cannot
form
the
basis
of
a
new
or
subsequent
crime
because
punishment
has
already
been
meted
out.
they
are
past
and
completed.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
no,
i
think
that
the
--
this
appeal
properly
before
this
court
goes
to
the
one
issue
on
the
constitutionality
as
a
reasonable
police
regulation.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
well,
i
--
as
i
gather
this
attack
here
is
upon
the
statute.
and
the
attack
is
so
broad
that
it
goes
not
only
from
the
statute
but
to
the
complaint
to
the
very
sections
which
not
are
--
that
are
not
involved.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
well,
i
think
it's
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
the
sections
require
that
they
give
their
names
and
all
aliases
and
all
crimes
that
they
have
been
convicted
of.
thus
far
as
to
my
knowledge
no
one
has
refused
to
divulge
that
information.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
that
is
a
part
of
the
registration.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes.
well,
i
think
as
this
court
has
indicated
if
there
are
any
objectionable
parts,
that
person
could
register
to
that
extent
and
refuse
to
register
as
to
the
other,
and
they
would
still
be
technically
complying
with
the
ordinance
and
not
in
violation.
but
generally,
the
ordinance
does
require
the
disclosure.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes,
we
do.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
that's
true.
the
form
does
require
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
sure
does
imply.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
no.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
i
know
that
it
is
being
done,
your
honor.
i
know
that
the
appellate
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes,
i
think
there
are.
i
know
that
a
writ
was
sought
in
a
recent
case
before
the
appellate
department
wherein
they
were
going
to
assume
jurisdiction
over
a
similar
type
of
situation
on
appeal
from
a
probationary
order
rather
than
from
a
final
judgement
of
conviction.
a
writ
was
sued
out
in
the
district
court
of
appeals
to
prohibit
the
appellate
department
of
the
superior
court
from
proceeding
in
an
attempt
to
exceed
their
jurisdiction.
and
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
well,
at
this
time
i
don't
think
there's
anything
further
for
the
court
to
do.
the
court
is
not
exceeding
its
jurisdiction
then.
all
orders
have
been
made.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
if
she
has
paid
her
fine.
no,
there
is
none.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
at
the
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
well,
from
my
understanding
what
--
from
what
counsel
has
devised
this
court
she
has
already
had
her
record
expunged.
i
think
the
only
thing
remaining
is
the
payment
of
the
$200
fine
as
a
condition
of
the
order.
that
has
been
stayed,
pending
this
--
these
various
appeals.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
$250.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
that's
right.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
well,
there
is
no
jail
sentences
yet.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
no.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
this
is
at
a
--
this
is
as
i
say
condition
of
probation.
the
court
may
thereafter
revoke
probation
upon
the
failure
to
pay
this
$250
fine
and
impose
sentence.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
comply
with
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
that's
right.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
any
time
within
the
three-year
period.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
that's
right.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
that's
right.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
that
is
right.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
it's
true.
depending
on
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
surely,
go
ahead
sir.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
no.
i
was
just
going
to
say
that
that
is
based
upon
this
so-called
attack
on
the
constitution
or
the
ordinance.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
as
i
recall,
the
city
of
los
angeles
enacted
this
ordinance
first
because
of
the
influx
of
persons
known
to
have
been
convicted
of
serious
crimes
under
their
police
power.
thereafter,
the
state
of
california
examining
all
these
sex
violations
that
were
taking
place,
feeling
that
if
these
persons
were
registered
there
would
be
a
better
protection
for
all
other
victims
or
persons
in
that
category.
the
two
sections
do
overlap
to
a
slight
degree.
the
state
statute
requires
persons
who
come
into
the
city
to
register
with
the
sheriff,
i
believe.
we'll
come
into
the
county
whereas
the
ordinance
requires
those
coming
into
the
city.
so
it
--
as
a
practical
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
no.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
only
so
far
as
the
sex
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
--
offenses
are
concerned.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
the
--
the
city
ordinance
is
broader
in
that
it
covers
the
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
it
might.
i
don't
recall
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
i
think
it
goes
on
a
little
further
too
does
it
not,
your
honor,
and
speak
about
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
--
any
offense
which
it
committed
or
attempted
in
this
state
would
have
been
punishable.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes,
sir.
in
that
first
paragraph,
it
goes
down
a
little
bit
further
than
that.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
and
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
see
--
it
be
very
--
after
the
words
well
for
an
institution
codes
or
any
person
who
has
been
since
said
date
or
is
hereafter
convicted
in
any
other
state
of
any
offense
which
if
committed
or
attempted
in
this
state
would
have
been
punishable.
so
that
they
do
overlap,
and
i
think
they
do
cover
the
same
substance
insofar
as
the
sex
offenses
are
concerned.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
primarily.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
no,
26
--
647
(a)
or
subdivisions
1
or
2
of
section
3
(11)
are
misdemeanor.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes.
the
first
--
the
first
group
of
numbers
there
are
felony
convictions.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
that's
right.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
that
would
be
true
if
it
were
that
type
of
an
offense,
if
committed
in
the
state
of
california.
that
is
an
extreme
example
however
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
well,
may
i
give
an
--
as
an
example.
in
some
states,
the
taking
of
property
of
a
value
$20
is
considered
a
felony,
that
would
not
require
registration
in
california.
it
must
be
a
property
over
$200.
that
is
the
interpretation.
if
the
crime
committed
elsewhere
had
been
committed
in
california,
wouldn't
that
constituted
a
felony
in
california.
so
your
example
of
being
disorderly
conduct
in
another
state
wouldn't
necessarily
be
a
felony
in
california.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
i
think,
generally,
it
is
the
felony
type
of
conviction
in
the
other
state
that
would
subject
the
person
to
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
--
knowledge.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
well,
may
i
attempt
to
answer
that
in
this
fashion.
i
think
this
court
has
said
that
persons
are
charged
with
knowledge
of
the
provisions
of
the
selective
service
act,
for
instance.
it
is
the
duty
upon
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
that
--
that
would
be
very
extreme,
your
honor.
it
was
usually
the
other
type
of
situation
where
a
person
has
been
convicted
of
a
felony
in
the
other
state
that
comes
to
california,
thereafter
is
determined
that
if
that
crime
would
have
been
a
felony
in
california.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
i
think
that
i
can't
give
you
any
figures.
this
law
review
article
or
this
seems
to
have
secured
data.
we
furnished
data
to
this
pennsylvania
university
and
when
they
were
making
this
research.
they
rolled
letters
all
over
to
try
to
find
out.
i
have
tried
to
get
from
the
police
department
accurate
records.
it's
next
to
impossible
to
say.
how
are
we
to
know
how
many
ex-convicts
are
in
the
city
of
los
angeles
unless
they've
registered.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes,
i
think
this
gives
some
figures
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
this
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
--
seems
to
indicate
that
--
well,
there
may
be
some
6000
persons
who
have
registered.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
population?
mr.
philip
e.
grey
well
again,
how
are
we
going
to
base
that
when
we
don't
know
how
many
persons
are
present,
who
have
prior
records
from
other
states
or
elsewhere?
mr.
philip
e.
grey
i
think
that
i
can
a
little
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
i
think
it
does
serve
a
certain
percentage.
it
does
serve
--
serve
a
certain
need
that
attempts
to
cover
and
does
cover
a
small
segment,
no
matter
how
small
it
does
carry
out
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
passed.
it
provides
a
protection
for
the
inhabitants
of
the
known
persons
who
are
there.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
i
think
that
would
--
was
a
very
gratuitous
statement
because
these
records
are
confidential.
i
can't
go
in
and
look
at
the
records
to
find
out
how
many
people
have
registered,
i
don't
know.
and
i
can
say
from
my
personal
knowledge
and
experience,
i
know
that
this
ordinance
has
been
enforced
in
this
fashion,
not
as
described
by
appellant.
information
has
been
brought
to
the
city
attorney
on
a
request
for
an
--
on
an
application
for
a
complaint.
they
will
say,
mr.
so
and
so
whose
record
is
as
follows,
showing
a
conviction
of
a
felony
in
this
state,
that
state,
in
the
other
state
is
now
in
the
city
of
los
angeles
residing
at
such
and
such
a
place.
he
has
lived
there
for
so
many
years.
we
applied
to
the
city
--
city
attorney
to
issue
a
criminal
complaint
on
which
a
warrant
of
arrest
is
based
and
thereafter
we
will
go
out
and
get
him.
they're
not
always
as
indicated
by
counsel.
so
that
it
is
next
to
impossible
to
answer
those
types
of
questions.
in
extreme
cases,
i
would
have
to
say
yes,
it
has
been
done
i
suppose.
but
generally,
we
feel
that
in
this
instance
every
time
appellant
has
attacked
any
of
these
provisions,
it
has
been
pointed
out,
it
has
been
inept,
it
has
been
answered.
counsel
alluded
briefly
to
the
appellate
procedures.
i
don't
think
that
that
has
a
place
in
this
record
because
their
state
practices
in
state
acts.
it
was
pointed
out
that
he
didn't
have
a
proper
appeal
from
the
--
an
order
of
final
judgment
of
conviction,
the
court
granted
the
hearing
on
the
merits
in
any
event.
it
was
later
pointed
out
that
the
oral
instructions
were
not
a
part
of
the
record.
thereafter,
motions
were
made
and
are
included
in
his
record
in
an
attempt
to
secure
those
things.
there
weren't
proper.
we
have
felt
throughout
this
proceeding
that
the
criminal
complaint
that
was
filed
was
based
upon
a
valid
constitutional
ordinance
that
the
procedure
was
regular.
there
was
a
conviction
duly
had
and
that
the
ordinance
should
be
upheld
by
this
court
on
that
same
ground.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
there
again
in
some
instances
where
we
have
had
these
things
i
know
of
my
personal
knowledge
that
a
defendant
who
has
been
arrested
has
gone
in
and
say,
“well,
your
honor,
may
we
have
a
continuance
for
five
days.
i'm
going
to
have
my
client
register
and
we'll
come
back
and
enter
a
plea
or
make
some
disposition.”
some
cases
has
been
suspended
sentences.
others,
there
have
been
straight
day
sentences
depending
on
each
and
every
particular
set
of
facts.
in
this
case,
counsel
have
said
that
this
took
four
days
to
try,
four
days
to
present
evidence
to
the
court
showing
and
stipulating
that
the
defendant
had
been
convicted
of
prior
felonies,
had
lived
in
the
city
of
los
angeles,
had
no
record
expunged,
had
failed
to
register.
it
took
had
four
days
to
do
that.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
the
sentence
itself,
i
don't
think
is
placing
a
person
on
probation.
the
imposition
of
a
fine
may
be
a
little
bit
heavy
but
i
think
by
virtue
of
the
four-day
trial,
maybe
the
court
became
a
little
early,
that
would
be
my
personal
opinion.
unfortunately,
the
appellant
must
suffer
for
that.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
it
would
be
by
refusing
to
comply
with
the
terms
and
conditions
of
probation
being
sentenced
to
city
jail
for
violating
her
term
--
her
probation
then
in
custody
applied
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
she'd
have
to
comply
with
the
provisions
in
order
to
be
out
of
custody
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
--
for
the
three-year
period.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
well,
as
i've
tried
to
point
a
moment
ago,
the
court
has
already
--
the
only
ministerial
act
would
then
be
by
the
clerk
to
issue
the
execution
for
the
payment
of
the
fine.
the
court
has
already
acted.
the
court
has
imposed
this
as
a
probationary
order
or
condition.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
well,
then
if
the
court
is
not
attempting
to
exceed
its
jurisdiction
with
a
writ
then
lie.
it
is
only
where
the
court
is
attempting
to
seek
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
that's
right.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
that's
right.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
no,
not
in
habeas
where
the
court
is
about
to
exceed
its
jurisdiction
before
he
has
already
made
that
determination.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
well,
let
me
say
that
generally
not
but
as
justice
frankfurter
has
put
the
point
to
me,
if
the
court
is
going
to
thereafter
do
something
to
carry
out
the
terms
of
the
original
order
which
has
been
held
to
be
valid,
their
district
court
shall
or
may
issue
a
writ
to
restrain
that
court
from
exceeding
its
jurisdiction.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
in
presenting
the
issue
in
that
fashion,
i
would
say
that
the
only
available
remedy
is
by
habeas
corpus.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
oh,
i
know
just
last
year
at
the
california
bar
association
convention,
there
was
quite
a
discussion
on
this
new
and
coming
thing,
this
writ
of
prohibition
and
its
uses.
so
that
there
--
there
might
be
a
--
hoping
to
stay,
a
state
of
confusion
with
it.
it
has
in
some
instances
been
--
i
think
in
some
--
i
have
summarized
the
issues
and
i
have
fully
covered
those
in
my
brief
that
i
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
no,
your
honor.
the
--
the
state
statute
is
not
directly
involved
at
all.
the
only
implication
that
is
made
is
that
if
an
ordinance
requiring
registration
is
unconstitutional
then
the
state
statute
should
fall,
and
then
all
other
states
who
have
similar
ordinances
or
statutes
would
suffer
the
same
faith
but
the
--
the
state
statute
is
not
here
involved.
the
only
one
is
municipal
ordinance
as
charged,
person
having
been
convicted
of
felonies
living
in
the
city
of
los
angeles
whose
record
had
not
been
expunged
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
complaint
as
charged,
who
did
not
register.
although,
that
is
a
reasonable
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
no,
i
would
not.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
no.
i
would
solely
say
that
in
representing
the
city
of
los
angeles,
i
would
be
called
upon
to
defend
the
actions
of
the
municipal
court
judge
before
any
district
court
or
the
supreme
court
should
mandamus
or
prohibition
or
habeas
corpus
be
issued.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
this
has
been
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
i
believe
not,
your
honor.
this
was
an
order
granting
probation
to
the
appellant
on
certain
conditions.
one
of
the
conditions
being
that
she
pay
a
fine
of
$250.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
well,
the
only
thing
that
would
happen
if
this
appellant
refuses
to
pay
the
$250
after
the
judgment
becomes
final
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
but
she
has
been
granted
a
stay
pending
the
outcome
of
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
oh,
then
the
court
would
call
the
appellant
before
the
court
and
say
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
i
don't
think
and
by
virtue
of
--
of
this
particular
wording
because
since
you
are
of
liberty
for
three
years
on
probation
on
condition
that
you
pay
us
$250.
if
you
don't
pay
us,
i
may
revoke
this
probation
and
sentence
you
to
180
days
in
jail
if
necessary.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
then
there
would
be
a
judgment
entered,
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
it
is
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
the
court
may
modify
probation
completely.
the
court
may
say
in
view
--
by
virtue
of
all
these
things
that
have
transpired,
by
virtue
of
your
position
the
court
will
suspend
imposition
of
sentence
to
terminate
probation.
or
the
court
may
say
that
you
have
willfully
refused
to
comply
with
the
order
of
this
court,
i
will
revoke
probation
and
impose
a
jail
sentence.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes.
well,
this
--
this
proceeding,
it
is
a
final
judgment.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
thank
you.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
propose
to
give
the
factual
background,
the
procedure
of
mr.
linn
in
the
attorney
general's
office
of
california
to
go
into
the
legal
acts,
aspects
more
likely.
to
begin
with,
this
case
arose
out
of
a
verified
complaint
being
filed
by
the
city
attorney
charging
that
this
appellant
had
failed
to
register
under
the
terms
and
provisions
of
our
ordinance.
upon
the
filing
of
the
complaint,
appellant
appeared
with
counsel
and
entered
a
general
demurrer,
raising
the
constitutional
questions.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes.
it
shows
that
there
was
an
argument
briefly
in
the
minutes.the
minutes
disclose
that
--
let's
see,
if
i
can
give
the
court
the
date
here.
on
march
the
3rd,
on
page
2
of
the
record,
defendant
in
court
demurrer
overruled,
enters
his
plea
of
not
guilty
of
the
offense
charged.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
that
is
not
in
the
record.
that
does
not
appear
in
the
record.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
i
can't
recall
whether
there
was
a
written
demurrer
or
not.
i
do
recall
going
over
to
the
arraignment
court
and
arguing
the
matter.
the
court,
at
that
time,
overruled
the
demurrer.upon
overruling
it,
a
plea
of
not
guilty
was
in
it.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes,
in
very
general
terms.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes,
it
was.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
but
the
statute
is
discriminatory
that
it
violates
due
process,
that
it's
self-incrimination,
that
it
permits
false
arrest.
the
--
the
entire
appeal
was
argued.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
vagueness
was
mentioned,
i
believe
also.
at
that
time,
in
answer
to
the
general
contentions,
i
think
i
pointed
out
to
the
arraignment
court
that
some
years
before,
the
appellate
department
of
the
los
angeles
superior
court
had
upheld
this
ordinance
in
people
versus
shirley.
it
is
not
a
reported
case.
i
think
i
have
mentioned
it
in
my
brief.
it
--
it's
one
of
the
memorandum
decisions.
they
held
that
it
was
a
proper
police
regulation.
in
their
original
unrecorded
opinion,
there,
a
petition
for
rehearing
was
filed.
the
appellate
department
granted
that
petition
and
in
its
subsequent
decision,
answered
the
general
contention
that
this
ordinance
was
directed
at
the
fact
of
conviction
rather
than
the
punishment
of
conviction
so
that
the
scope
of
the
ordinance
was
if
a
person
had
in
fact
been
convicted
of
a
crime
which
was
punishable
in
california
as
a
felony,
that
person
was
required
to
register
regardless
of
whether
or
not
in
fact
that
person
had
subsequently
received
a
sentence
which
made
it
a
misdemeanor
for
all
purposes
thereafter.
the
court
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes.
generally,
they
felt
that
that's
what
the
city
council
had
in
mind.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
it
was
to
show
the
nature
of
the
act
for
which
this
person
had
been
convicted,
showing
his
criminal
tendencies
or
whatever
it
might
be.
all
right,
then
the
demurrer
was
overruled,
the
matter
was
set
for
trial.
at
the
time
of
trial,
there
were
some
amendments
to
the
complaint.
all
the
material
facts
which
was
sought
to
be
introduced
and
proved
by
witnesses
were
in
fact
stipulated
too
so
that
the
essentials
of
the
charge
were
found
in
the
record,
that
the
appellant
had
been
twice
convicted
of
felonies
committed
in
the
state
of
california,
that
she
had
registered
with
the
chief
of
police,
that
she
had
resided
in
the
city
of
los
angeles
for
more
than
five
days
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
--
that
her
record
had
not
been
expunged.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
well,
in
california,
we
say
that
a
felony
is
a
sentence
to
the
state
prison.
however,
if
it
is
a
--
the
nature
of
the
crime
can
be
either
a
sentence
to
state
of
imprisonment
or
to
the
county
jail
after
a
judgment
sentencing
that
person
to
the
county
jail
for
a
term
less
than
one
year,
it
becomes
a
misdemeanor.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
no.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
our
ordinance
reads,
if
it
--
the
crime
would
have
been
punishable
as
a
felony
in
california
and
the
appellate
department
in
that
people
versus
shirley
held
that
the
intention
of
a
legislative
body
was
to
show
the
fact
of
a
conviction
of
a
felony
type
of
crime,
not
the
actual
punishment
received,
but
the
fact
that
that
person
had
been
convicted
of
a
crime
punishable
in
california
as
a
felony.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
if
that
were
a
--
if
committed
in
the
state
of
california
was
also
a
felony,
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
now,
the
example
that
you
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
then
that
person
would
not
have
to
register
because
it
was
not
punishable
as
a
felony
if
committed
in
the
state
of
california.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
that
is
correct.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes.
that
is
correct.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
we
must
show
that
that
is
punishable
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
--
as
a
felony
in
california.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes.
that's
the
one
case
that
the
counsel
mentioned.
mr.
mcmorris
mentioned
it,
in
re
digiuro
was
of
that
nature.
we
couldn't
show
that
the
crime
committed
outside
the
state.
it
was
a
federal
offense
there.
i
think
it
was
counterfeiting
of
united
states
money
under
the
federal
statute.
we
had
difficulty
in
finding
a
crime
in
california
which
punished
that
act.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
well,
it
must
be
a
crime
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
no.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
i
think
that
a
defendant
realizes
that
he
has
going
to
follow
the
law
and
--
and
committed
a
crime
of
a
felony
class
on
each.
i
think
i'll
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
if
i
can
go
in
to
the
practical
application
of
this
law,
i
may
be
able
to
clarify
that
also.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
i
--
i
should
like
to.
i'd
like
to
continue
on
with
this
procedural
aspect.
so
that
each
and
every
one
of
the
elements
necessary
for
this
crime
was
actually
established
during
the
course
of
the
trial
by
stipulation.
thereafter,
the
verdict
of
the
jury
was
returned,
finding
the
appellant
guilty.
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
was
made
out
also
in
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment.
at
that
time,
appellant
again
raised
the
constitutional
issues
in
a
very
general
classification,
and
for
the
first
time,
offered
to
prove
certain
things
which
would
go
into
the
nature
of
a
false
arrest.
there
was
no
evidence
introduced
during
the
course
of
the
trial
concerning
the
facts
of
the
arrest.
they
were
all
stipulated
too
that
this
person
had
remained
in
the
city
for
more
than
five
days,
had
been
convicted
of
felony,
had
not
registered
whose
record
had
not
been
expunged.
so
that
after
the
completion
of
the
trial
on
the
verdict
of
the
jury
for
the
first
time
is
there
sought
to
be
introduced
any
sort
of
evidence
by
an
offer
of
proof
which
was
not
permissible
under
the
provisions
of
our
motion
of
arrest
of
judgment.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that
in
the
trial
court
level
of
this
case,
there
was
no
question
raised
as
to
unlawful
search
or
seizure,
false
imprisonment,
any
factual
basis
other
than
the
actual
elements
of
the
crime
of
being
a
person
who
had
suffered
prior
convictions,
in
fact,
those
two
prior
convictions
had
been
suffered
in
the
state
of
california,
should
been
a
resident
over
the
required
period
of
time,
she
had
not
registered
where
the
chief
of
police
has
required
by
the
ordinance.
this
record
had
not
been
expunged.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
if
it
please
the
court,
may
i
pass
that
on
to
mr.
linn
on
the
legal
end
of
it.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
and
attempt
to
answer
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
--
some
of
the
questions
that
were
asked
yesterday
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
--
by
the
justice.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
some
of
the
questions
that
have
been
here
propounded
have
raised
the
question
if
the
crime
had
been
committed
outside
of
the
state
of
california,
then
a
person
isn't
likely
to
know
of
the
nature
of
the
statute.
i
emphasized
that
to
show
that
this
appellant
does
not
come
within
that
classification.
emphasis
has
been
made
that
first
offender
should
not
be
required
to
register.
i
emphasize
the
fact
that
there
were
two
prior
convictions
because
this
appellant
is
not
a
first
offender
there.
i
want
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
that's
right.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
two
separate
indictments
and
two
separate
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
--
pleas
of
guilty
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
--
entered
to
those
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
--
to
the
question.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
well,
there
are
two
convictions
on
record.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
it's
a
question
of
timing
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
--
had
the
sentence
had
been
imposed
on
the
first
one
and
then
the
second
indictment
brought
before
the
court,
there'll
be
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
--
no
question
about
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
--
a
second
offense.
i'll
bring
out
the
--
emphasize.
i
think
there
were
two
convictions,
a
first
offender
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
under
the
general
terms
of
the
ordinance.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
well,
i
answer
that
to
this
extent
that
they
were
interested
in
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
was
the
actual
judgment
of
conviction
or
the
fact
of
conviction.
the
court
has
never
passed
upon
that
other
phase
of
it
whether
or
not
it
applied
outside
of
the
state.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
that's
true.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
but
i'm
trying
to
emphasize
that
the
facts
of
this
case
do
not
warrant
going
outside
of
the
state
of
california,
so
to
speak.
i
think
mr.
justice
brennan
yesterday
asked
about
the
actual
practice.
in
my
experience,
some
14
years
with
the
city
attorney
in
close
contact
with
the
police
department,
we
know
that
this
law
is
enforced
in
the
--
to
the
same
extent
as
is
any
other
law
of
the
state
of
california
insofar
as
it
affects
strangers
to
the
state.
a
person
coming
in
to
the
state
who
has
been
in
business
in
some
other
state
for
a
number
of
years
attempts
to
open
a
place
of
business.
he
is
not
permitted
with
the
laws
of
california
nor
the
laws
of
the
city
of
los
angeles.
should
he
violate
the
law,
generally,
when
it
comes
to
the
attention
of
the
law
enforcement
officers,
he
is
given
notice
or
warning.
you
are
engaging
in
a
business
that
requires
a
special
type
of
permit.
you
should
get
that
permit.
now,
in
this
matter
here,
i
think
that
generally,
most
of
the
persons
who
are
either
interviewed
as
witnesses
or
suspect
of
a
crime
are
interrogated,
not
only
as
to
the
nature
of
the
present
business
but
generally
as
to
their
past
activities.
if
during
the
course
of
an
interview,
it
becomes
apparent
to
the
law
enforcement
officers
that
this
man
has
suffered
a
prior
conviction,
he
is
generally
advised
that
in
los
angeles,
a
person
must
register.
in
many
instances,
the
person
is
arrested
upon
probable
cause
for
some
other
crime.
this
becomes
an
incident
to
the
general
investigation.
i
think
the
figures
that
we
have
shown
do
reflect
that
that
is
the
proper
procedure,
the
answers
to
the
question
propounded
by
the
amicus
curiae.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
and
the
courts
with
these
responses
by
the
member
of
the
police
department
to
amicus
curiae.
they
indicate
that
the
usual
practice
in
answer
to
question
number
six
which
is
contained
in
my
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
--
supplemental
brief.
the
question
was,
“is
it
now
or
has
it
ever
been
the
policy
to
permit
felons
to
register
and
then
release
them
when
there
is
no
other
charge
upon
which
to
hold
them?”
the
answer,
“ex-convicts
who
have
failed
to
register
as
such
are
rarely
booked
on
that
charge
alone.
the
policy
is
to
allow
the
subject
to
register
and
then
release
him
except
in
those
cases
where
a
subject
is
uncooperative
and/or
is
frequent
in
high
crime
rate
areas
of
the
city.”
mr.
philip
e.
grey
that
is
generally
the
policy.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
we
don't
know,
your
honor.
the
evidence
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
i
can't
say.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
there
is
an
offer
of
proof
made
at
the
time
that
in
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
was
made
to
the
court
after
the
verdict
of
guilty
had
been
returned
and
offer
to
prove
certain
facts
in
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment,
the
court
is
only
interested
in
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
the
form
of
the
complaint,
not
in
the
evidence.
so
that
it
was
improperly
presented
at
that
time.
at
no
time
during
the
course
of
the
trial
was
there
any
evidence
offered
to
show
the
facts
or
circumstances
surrounding
the
arrest
but
then
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
no.
this
is
what
has
happened
in
many
instances,
going
further
with
my
practical
application.
for
persons
who
have
been
interviewed
or
suspected
of
crime,
and
it
is
determined
by
the
law
enforcement
officers
that
there
has
been
a
prior
conviction
suffered
by
this
particular
person.
if
that
person
is
seen
or
interviewed
over
a
period
of
time,
more
than
five
days
and
one
month,
investigation
shows
that
they
have
resided
at
a
particular
place
within
a
necessary
period
of
time,
investigation
checks
to
see
that
the
crime
for
which
they
were
convicted
actually
would
have
been
a
felony
in
the
state
of
california,
an
application
for
a
complaint
is
made
to
the
city
attorney.
this
application
then
lists
all
of
the
various
elements
that
are
necessary
to
prove
and
establish
the
violation
of
this
law.
thereafter,
a
warrant
is
secured.
now,
what
happened
in
this
case?
i
really
do
not
know
except
for
this
offer
proof.
there
was
no
question
raised
nor
any
law
enforcement
officer
required
to
establish
probable
cause
for
the
arrest.
i
know
that
this
began
with
a
verified
complaint
charging
a
person
with
having
violated
a
municipal
ordinance.
the
evidence
is
presented
in
that
light.
what
the
background
may
have
been?
there
may
have
been
all
the
probable
cause
in
the
world
to
arrest
this
person,
for
all
i
know
or
there
may
have
been
none.
at
any
event,
there
was
no
illegal
search
nor
seizure.
there
was
no
evidence
taken
from
the
appellant
which
was
introduced
in
the
court.
had
there
been
a
false
arrest,
there
would
have
been
a
civil
remedy
but
not
a
criminal
remedy.
the
charge
before
the
court
was
that
this
person
was
an
ex-convict
who
had
failed
to
register.
those
were
the
elements
that
were
presented
to
the
court.
they
were
established
by
--
mostly
by
stipulation
and
proof
of
this
prior
conviction.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
bookings
for
other
charges?
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes,
i
see
that.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
well,
the
other
thing
is
given
through
the
answer
to
questions
two
and
three
indicate
that
there
were
only
39
arrests
during
1956
for
this
particular
charge
and
of
the
39,
36
of
these
resulted
in
complaints
being
issued
by
the
city
attorney.
i
think
what
they
--
they
meant
to
say
that
many
more
persons
have
been
told
to
register
than
appear
by
the
number
of
bookings
as
39
figures
because
i
think
it's
understandable
that
the
police
department
is
not
interested
in
the
minor
type
of
violation
if
they
are
investigating
a
major
crime.
and
this
becomes
an
incident
to
it.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
well,
i
have
--
the
figures
indicate
that
only
39
occurred
in
1956.
may
i
go
further
and
say
this
that
under
california
law,
in
recent
years,
we
--
the
supreme
court
and
the
appellate
courts
have
stated
this,
“that
it
is
the
duty
of
the
police
officer
to
stop
and
question
persons
seen
on
the
streets
during
the
late
hours,
that
it
is
a
right
and
duty
or
a
privilege
to
protect
the
general
public
whether
they
are
committing
crime
or
not,
there's
nothing
wrong
in
stopping
a
person
and
talking.”
then
the
cases
have
gone
further
and
said,
“that
if
during
an
interview
a
person
reveals
that
he
has
committed
a
crime,
there
is
justification
for
an
arrest.”
let's
take
for
an
example
this
type
of
situation.
during
the
early
mornings
of
the
hour,
police
officers
see
a
person
walking
down
in
a
warehouse
district,
everything
is
closed.
they
stopped
and
talked
to
the
person.
during
the
course
of
this
conversation,
he
revealed
that
he
had
suffered
one
or
two
prior
convictions.
the
officer
would
be
justified
in
making
an
arrest
for
a
misdemeanor
committed
in
his
presence
under
those
circumstances.
so
that
that
may
be
the
result
of
these
39
cases,
it
may
not.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
that's
right,
violation
of
this
ordinance.
but
it
was
surprise
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
pardon.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
again,
the
only
thing
that
i
know
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
there
again,
that
appears
in
the
record.
at
the
time
of
the
motion
for
arrest
of
judgment
was
made
by
an
offer
of
proof,
there
is
no
such
evidence
in
the
record
except
by
way
of
this
offer
of
proof
which
was
not
material
to
the
court
in
considering
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
--
a
motion
and
arrest
of
judgment.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
i
would
think
these
figures
to
be
beneficial
to
me,
your
honor,
by
saying
this,
that
of
the
245,000
of
arrests
made
during
the
year
of
1956
--
225,000,
for
major
crimes,
most
of
those
people
have
registers
as
has
reflected
by
the
answer
to
question
number
one
showing
some
43,000
persons
registered.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
oh,
i
think
that
covers
the
entire
period
since
the
existence
of
the
ordinance.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
since
1933.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
we
have
no
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes,
we
have.
but
how
are
the
law
enforcement
officers
of
the
city
of
los
angeles
going
to
know
the
presence
in
the
city
of
these
particular
people
who
have
been
convicted
unless
they
do
register
or
unless
do
some
other
investigation
or
means
the
attention
to
the
law
enforcement
agencies
are
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
it
would
be
difficult
to
have
the
police
officers
investigate
in
great
detail.
i
think
the
law
review
article
of
pennsylvania
answers
that
to
a
certain
extent
stating
that
a
detective
is
looking
for
a
major
crime.
he
devotes
more
time
and
effort
and
he
uncovers
this
and
he
said,
“well,
let
that
go.
i'm
trying
to
establish
larceny,
burglary
--
mr.
philip
e.
grey
--
and
murder.”
and
it
becomes
an
incidental
thing.
of
the
39,
those,
perhaps,
are
situations
where
no
other
charge
was
made
and
a
person
refused
to
register
as
a
last
resort.
this
ordinance
was
enforced.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
well,
as
i've
started
my
remarks
here,
i
have
said
that
common
practice
is
to
request
a
person
to
register.
they
meet
him
again
on
the
street,
a
matter
of
weeks
and
months
later,
they
ask
him,
“have
you
registered
since?”
“no.
i'll
get
to
it
in
a
week
or
so.”
checked
with
the
registration
or
records
reveal
that
he
has
not
registered,
then
goes
back
--
brought
to
the
city
attorney
and
then
complain
it.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
not
in
the
ordinance
itself,
no.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
i
think
it's
become
a
just
a
matter
of
policy
in
investigation
and
interrogation
as
i
have
attempted
to
say
in
the
field,
they
are
advised.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
custom
over
a
period
of
time.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
no,
not
that
i
know.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
i
think
yesterday
mr.
justice
frankfurter
asked
a
question
to
counsel
as
to
the
justification
for
this
type
of
an
ordinance.
being
interested
in
this
case
knowing
it's
coming
up
before
this
court,
i
noted
a
news
article
appearing
august
the
8th
in
the
los
angeles
times.
it
was
significant
to
me
in
that
it
showed
a
young
girl,
a
secretary,
22
years
of
age,
walking
down
the
street
when
a
man
grabbed
her,
stuck
a
knife
in
her
back,
dragged
her
to
the
rear
of
a
house.
he
assaulted
her,
she
screamed,
and
he
left.
this
young
lady
was
taken
to
the
police
department.
she
was
able
to
identify
the
victim
by
police
photographs.
it
appears
that
this
man
had
registered
in
1948
as
an
ex-convict
having
been
sentenced
in
the
state
of
indiana
for
criminal
attack
upon
a
25-year
old
woman.
therefore,
a
period
of
nine
years,
there
was
no
criminal
activity
yet.
and
on
occasion
of
--
of
this
sort,
he
was
apprehended.
he
was
identified
because
of
the
mode,
the
method
that
was
used
in
the
prior
case
to
the
most
recent
one.
so
i
think
that
that
is
one
example
where
a
justification
is
present.
i
think
it's
also
interesting
to
note
that
on
october
the
8th
of
this
year,
a
news
article
appears
stating
that
in
the
united
state
district
court,
southern
district
of
california,
the
matter
of
the
case
of
united
states
of
america
versus
hermeghan,
perez,
garcia
and
garcia,
numbers
26-641,
san
diego
criminal
records.
judge
carter
was
called
upon
in
the
trial
court
level
to
pass
upon
section
1407
of
title
18
of
the
united
states
code
annotated.
the
--
we
wrote
a
35-page
opinion
holding
this
section
to
be
constitutional.
and
in
part,
the
statute
provides
that
no
citizen
of
the
united
states
who
is
addicted
to
or
uses
narcotic
drugs
as
defined
by
the
internal
revenue
code
or
who
has
been
convicted
of
a
violation
of
any
of
the
narcotic
or
marijuana
laws
of
the
united
states
or
of
any
state
thereof,
the
penalty
for
which
is
imprisonment
for
more
than
one
year
shall
depart
from
or
enter
into
or
attempt
to
depart
from
or
enter
into
the
united
states
unless
such
person
--
such
person
registers
under
the
rule
prescribed
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury,
providing
a
penalty
of
$1000
or
imprisonment
for
not
less
than
one
or
more
than
three
years.
in
this
opinion,
justice
carter
answers
most
of
the
questions
or
attempts
to
answer
them
that
have
been
here
raised
as
to
the
right
of
self-incrimination,
the
right
to
travel
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute.
and
that
i
was
very
interested
to
know
that
congress
had
in
1956
passed
that
statute.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
yes,
it
is.
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
grey
no.
we
have
various
sections
of
our
ordinance
which
are
directed
to
narcotics,
sections
directed
to
sex
violators
and
the
general
felony
type
of
conviction.
i've
asked
mr.
linn
to
take
up
the
legal
matters.
