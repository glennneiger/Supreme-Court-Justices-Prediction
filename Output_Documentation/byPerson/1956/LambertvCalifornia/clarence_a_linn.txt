mr.
clarence
a.
linn
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
--
i
hope
we
don't
lose
sight
of
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
because
of
the
peculiarities
surrounding
this
particular
case
in
which
the
lady
concerned
was
fined
$250
and
given
three
years
probation.
there
may
have
been
some
matters
that
took
place
at
or
about
the
time
the
officers
made
inquiry
of
her.
for
instance,
in
their
offer
of
proof
at
one
place
here,
they
say
that
she
was
--
at
the
time
of
her
arrest,
she
was
in
the
company
of
her
employer
and
attorney.
i
don't
know
whether
it
was
my
friend
here,
it
might
have
been
me
and
after
the
thing
had
happened,
i
have
a
--
somewhat
of
a
reputation
for
being
(inaudible)
and
quite
a
scene
might
have
happened
if
they
tried
to
arrest
my
secretary,
and
i
didn't
think
she
was
guilty,
i
don't
know
whether
it
happened
in
this
case
or
not.
but
anyway,
an
incident
arose
there.
and
the
lady
was
packed
off
to
jail
and
she
had
a
four-day
jury
trial
on
stipulated
facts.
and
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
--
by
the
time
we
got
through,
the
--
the
judge
may
have
been
aggravated,
the
police
officer
evidently
aggravated.
i
have
no
doubt
the
lady
was
aggravated,
and
i
have
no
doubt
counsel
was
aggravated.
and
those
things,
although
they
shouldn't
happen,
practicalities
tell
us
they
do
happen.
and
i
hope
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
what?
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
everybody
got
mad.
and
--
and
the
lady
got
fined
$250,
it
would
have
been
a
$5
case
otherwise.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
in
that
--
that's
--
that's
right.
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
and
the
purposes
should
not
be
overlooked
because
of
what
happened
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
in
this
particular
case
that
probably
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
--
is
not
what
the
--
the
part
that
would
have
done.
if
the
--
if
the
lady
had
been
picked
up
in
some
place
and
--
and
questioned
and
brought
in
and
there
hadn't
been
a
--
a
little
ruckus
overt,
the
--
the
thing
would
have
happened
as
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
well,
there's
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
--
nothing
in
the
record.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
well,
i
am
--
i
am
reading
from
their
offer
of
proof.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
it
says
that
she
protested
this
conduct.
she
was
handcuffed
and
roughly
shoved
into
the
rear
of
prowl
type
driving
--
driven
by
the
arresting
officers
at
the
time
of
her
arrest.
she
was
on
the
company
of
her
employer
and
a
lawyer
--
attorney
who
attempted
to
discuss
the
matter
with
the
arresting
officers,
and
they
ignored
it.
and
that
she
was
taken
to
the
wheelchair
station.
that's
what
the
offer
of
proof
which
was
not
accepted
because
it
was
brought
in,
in
support
of
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
after
trial
had
been
completed
and
judgment
was
about
to
be
pronounced.
it
wasn't
--
i'm
just
taking
this
at
its
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes.
that's
--
that's
what
i
referred
to
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
--
as
a
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
--
as
a
ruckus.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
no.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
there
is
none.
the
only
thing
that
could
have
been
done,
i
don't
know
that
it's
necessary,
it
would
have
been
perhaps
on
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
this
particular
ordinance.
that
has
been
done
in
california
in
misdemeanor
cases
where
you
can't
get
any
higher
than
the
appellate
division
of
the
superior
court.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes.
she
--
she's
--
there's
no
question
about
that.
now,
there's
been
some
question
raised,
what's
one
matter
of
policy
that
in
some
question
raised
as
to
--
to
how
these
people
are
registered,
we
have
filed,
we
have
filed
here
with
the
court,
a
letter
for
the
department
of
corrections
attached
to
it
the
regulations
of
the
department
of
corrections
which
is
the
prison
authority
of
the
state
of
california.
and
we
must
remember
that
it
is
the
policy
of
the
department
of
corrections
not
to
release
prisoners
except
on
parole,
subject
to
supervision
for
a
period.
every
parole
officer
is
instructed
to
see
that
these
people
registered.
the
man
is
given
a
pamphlet
or
a
piece
of
paper,
a
mimeographed
piece
of
paper
telling
the
cities
in
which
registration
is
required,
the
jurisdiction's
county
wide
in
which
registration
is
required,
he
has
given
a
course
of,
they
call,
pre-parole
training
in
which
he
is
directed
to
do
this
thing.
and
every
parolee,
i
think
you
can
say
without
a
peradventure
of
a
doubt
that
goes
to
los
angeles
county,
well,
the
city
is
a
mad
county,
or
other
places
in
the
state
where
they
are
required
to
register
is
told
to
register
and
they
checked
it.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
in
california.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
that's
right.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
well,
he
would
have
to
register
and
he
would
be
presumed
to
know
the
law.
the
fact
that
the
man
comes
from
new
jersey
wouldn't
give
him
any
greater
rights.
he
now
the
same
difficulty
in
determining
whether
his
crime
was
committed
in
new
jersey
was
the
felony
in
california
as
he
would
have,
what
he
was
charged
with
recidivism
in
california.
your
prior
convictions
no
matter
where
they
were
--
were
committed
become
a
--
a
part
of
the
proceeding
in
california.
those
things
are
things
which
are
incident
to
law
enforcement
and
as
the
police
states.
and
i
think
it's
correct,
policemen
don't
go
after
people
willy-nilly.
if
a
person
hasn't
registered,
just
call
to
there
attention
from
outside
the
state,
they
are
registered.
very
impersonal
in
these
matters
except
that
upon
unique
occasions
that
happened.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
no.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
no.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
but
the
probation
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
--
officer
in
los
angeles
has
filed
--
supplied
mr.
grey
with
a
similar
letter
which
is
on
file
that
it
is
their
policy,
although
they
do
not
have
the
written
regulations
as
does
the
department
of
corrections.
the
probation
officer
in
los
angeles
county
advises
the
people
of
the
necessity
of
registering.
and
--
so
that
covers
practically
all
the
people
who
would
be
subject
to
the
act
in
california,
this
ordinance,
except
the
people
who
come
from
outside
the
state.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
not
unless
--
i
have
no
information,
we
--
not
unless
the
probation
officer
from
their
particular
county
in
caring
for
these
people
would
advice
them.
and
that
many
--
many
probation
officers,
they
transfer
their
probations
when
they
move
from
one
county
to
another,
they
transfer
them
to
the
supervision
of
the
probationer
in
the
other
county
or
the
probation
officer
in
the
other
county.
and
i
would
think
that
there,
he
would
get
the
information.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
that's
true.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
if
we
want
to
rely
upon
a
purely
legal
proposition,
all
men
are
presumed
to
know
the
law.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
it
comes
to
that
foundation.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
that's
the
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes,
i
know.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
it
takes
care
of
all
of
who
come
out
of
state's
prison
and
all
who
come
out
of
--
out
of
the
probation
office
in
los
angeles
county
and
if
we
weigh
the
population
of
the
state,
we
will
see
that
that
would
take
care
of
a
--
more
than
a
majority
of
it.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
at
northern
california,
i
concede
that
los
angeles
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
--
of
the
whole
population.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
but
here,
we
got
--
this
--
this
is
a
--
i
know
about
the
hardships
of
these
registration
laws.
this
--
this
is
--
is
a
small
amount
compared
to
the
sex
registration
law,
sex
violators
that
we
have
in
california,
a
state-wide
law,
all
types
of
sex
violators
have
to
register.
they
have
to
register
with
their
sheriff,
the
chief
of
police.
when
they
change
their
residence,
they
have
to
register.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
no,
i
don't
think
so.
in
the
sex
crime
--
remember
they
--
the
--
all
kinds
of
--
what
we
call
the
“california
lewd
bag”
as
to
registry.
a
statutory
rape,
i've
had
this
people
come
in
and
say,
“this
poor
young
man,”
when
he
was
in
high
school,
“did
something
and
now
he's
40
years
old,
he
has
to
registry
--
he
has
to
register.”
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
the
legislature
said
so.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
40
years
old
--
i
had
a
case
right
on
my
desk
about
a
boy
who
did
something
when
he
was
17
years
old
and
he
was
trying
to
be
a
deputy
sheriff
now
and
for
the
first
time
in
this
--
he
--
he
is
confronted
with
this
thing.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
he's
registered
as
a
sex
offender.
and
he
--
he
has
precluded
from
getting
this
job
because
this
thing
has
been
made
known,
and
that
we
have
their
fathers
and
mothers
in
everyday.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes,
that's
--
that's
true.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
well
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
--
my
arithmetic
is
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
is
bad.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
but
the
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
well
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
--
(voice
overlap)
bad
but
the
law
is
good
and
that's
the
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
now,
we
come
to
the
classic
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
well,
he's
registered.
they
have
his
name
there
registered
as
a
sex
offender
at
the
age
of
17.
he
can't
get
disposition
as
a
deputy
sheriff.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
no,
he
is
not
precluded
by
law.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
that's
--
they
--
it
--
that's
the
thing
that
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
--
that
hurts
the
most.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
that's
what
i
was
going
to
come
to.
about
this
violation
of
privacy,
the
thing
that
you
have
to
do
under
this
law,
i'll
admit
that
all
of
the
information
that
the
police
gathered
in
los
angeles
is
here
in
washington,
d.c.
that's
also
in
the
bureau
of
investigation
in
the
state
of
california
at
sacramento.
the
police,
for
reasons
of
local
efficiency,
desired
to
have
the
record
there
where
they
have
immediate
access
to
it.
i
cannot
see
anything
objectionable
in
that.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
you
put
him
in
jail
here
for
not
registering
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
--
because
the
community
legislature
has
said,
the
legislature
body
of
the
community
has
said
that,
“in
its
wisdom,
it
believes
this
is
a
way
to
prevent
crime."
and
the
reasonableness
of
that
rule
as
the
presumption
in
favor,
you
have
to
show
that
the
rule
is
unreasonable
that
it's
a
capricious
classification.
the
attack
must
be
made
by
the
petitioner.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes,
sir.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
all
persons
convicted
of
felonies,
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
which
kind
of
felony,
where
this
recidivism
lie,
if
we
word
forgery
as
--
is,
we
know,
one
of
the
crimes
in
which
there
is
a
fairly
high
rate
of
recidivism.
we
know
the
legislature
said
it
is
so
in
sex
crimes,
narcotics,
we
know
armed
robbery
for
the
purposes
of
administration.
if
nothing
else,
it
would
be
reasonable
to
say,
"well,
let's
have
all
people
registered,
whether
they're
stockbrokers
who've
run
afoul
of
the
law
in
selling
stock
or
burglars
who
have
broken
into
stores”.
if
you
have
to
break
it
down
too
much,
then
you
have
an
administrative
problem
worse
than
--
than
judge
brennan
contemplates
about
the
people
who
come
from
new
jersey
charged
with
crimes
if
they
do
not
know
of
felonies
in
california.
the
administrative
problem
would
be
great
if
you
had
to
set
it
and
the
statistics.
you
have
to
compile
and
to
show
which
crimes
were
more
subject
or
became
more
prominent
as
you
--
as
you
study
recidivism.
the
class
of
that
occasion
based
on
conviction
of
crime
and
that's
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes,
that's
true.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
narcotics,
is
one,
sex
crime
is
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
--
supposed
to
be
another.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
i'm
not
a
specialist
on
it
but
those
are
the
figures
that
the
legislature
accepts.
i
don't
know
whether
sex
crimes
are.
i
--
those
are
the
ones
that
bother
us
most
on
these
registrations
because
people
have
a
certain
horror
and
naturally
so
and
rightfully
so
of
--
of
that
type
of
criminal.
and
--
and
those
--
that
is
also
a
crime
which
some
young
people
fall
astray
of
the
law
in
and
outgrow
it
probably
more
rapidly
than
in
some
others.
that's
not
my
job.
that's
the
legislature
who
studies
these
things
and
makes
the
classification.
but
the
classification
here
is
one
convicted
of
crime.
the
law
applies
to
that
person.
now,
that
classification
is
the
oldest
crime
itself.
you
can't
vote
to
california
if
you've
been
convicted
of
a
felony.
you
can't
vote
public
office.
you
can't
get
public
employment.
it's
a
ground
for
divorce.
it's
a
ground
for
impeachment
of
witness.
it
disqualifies
persons
from
being
jurors.
you
can't
carry
firearms
of
--
own
or
possess
firearms
except
under
very
stringent
rules.
persons
convicted
of
certain
effect
of
sex
crimes
that
are
required
to
register.
narcotic
addicts
are
required
to
register
under
the
federal
law.
these
are
all
classifications
based
upon
conviction
of
crime.
and
they
are
as
old
as
our
laws.
in
nebbia
versus
united
states,
this
statement
is
made,
“the
fifth
amendment,
in
the
field
of
a
federal
activity,
and
the
fourteenth
amendment,
as
respects
state
action,
do
not
prohibit
governmental
regulation
for
the
public
welfare
and
the
guarantee
of
due
process,
as
has
been
held,
demands
only
that
the
law
shall
not
be
unreasonable,
arbitrary
or
capricious
and
that
the
means
selected
shall
have
a
real
and
substantial
relation
to
the
right
to
be
attained.”
now,
take
this
question
of
recidivism
or
professionalism
in
crime.
you
have
all
kinds
of
statistics.
probation
officers
show
that
their
probationers
make
good
records.
parole
officers
show
that
their
parolees
make
good
records.
the
prison
records
also
show
this.
they
show
that
in
the
year
1945
to
1949,
the
records
compiled
by
the
bureau
of
criminal
statistics
of
california
show
that
only
a
little
over
one
fourth
or
25.8%
of
the
people
admitted
to
prison,
finally
get
that,
no
prior
criminal
record
at
the
time
of
the
admission
to
prison.
now,
74.2%
of
the
people
who
are
received
into
that
prison
have
had
prior
criminal
experiences,
37.6%
prior
jail
or
juveniles
are
brushes
with
the
law,
24.5%
at
one
prior
criminal
term,
9%
had
two
prior
criminal
imprisonments,
and
7.1%
three
or
more
prior
--
three
or
more
convictions.
this
shows
that
these
people
are
potentially
recidivists.
over
75%
of
them
are
potentially
recidivist
because
they
have
repeatedly
committed
offenses.
they're
right
out
of
prison
on
parole
in
los
angeles
county,
los
angeles
city,
other
cities
of
the
state,
and
san
franscisco
not
among
them,
have
said
by
ordinance
that
these
people
must
register
because
in
the
opinion
of
the
legislative
body,
they
are
potentially
dangerous
to
the
community.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
he
--
but
this
change
in
addresses
are
not.
you
could
have
a
central
state-wide
one.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
when
he
comes
out
of
jail.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
or
after
his
conviction,
if
he's
released
on
probation.
he
never
goes
to
jail,
let's
say,
in
--
in
probation
cases,
in
many
of
them.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
well,
i
suppose
he
could
but
he
--
it'd
be
on
his
way
to
san
quentin
or
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
after
they
are
convicted,
yes.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes,
out
of
jail.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
after
they
have
served
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
or
put
on
probation,
yes,
that's
it.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
you
could
have
a
central
register
then.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
that's
it.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
that's
--
that's
correct.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
that's
--
that's
the
way
to
keep
--
keep
track
and
then
he
is
required
every
time
he
changes
his
residence
to
--
to
note
that
fact,
just
the
same
as
i
have
to
do.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
he
must
--
he
must
give
notice
of
his
change
of
residence.
as
i
was
going
to
say,
justice,
i
have
to
do
to
the
motor
vehicle
department
of
my
automobile.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
no,
no.
here's
a
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
no.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
when
he
has
served
his
term
of
probation
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
--
and
his
record
is
expunged,
then
he
no
longer
has
to
register.
and
that
is
a
--
that
thing
is
done
regularly.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
oh,
now,
i
--
there's
--
there's
that
matter.
there's
a
rehabilitation
provision
in
the
california
statute
where
a
man
can,
by
applying
to
the
--
to
the
court,
get
a
certificate
of
rehabilitation
which
is
then
presented
to
the
governor
and
the
governor
grants
him
a
--
a
pardon
based
upon
this
rehabilitation.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
no.
the
governor
does
not
have
to
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
but
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
if
he
hasn't
been
rehabilitated.
i
want
to
--
i
want
to
qualify
what
i
have
said
there.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
there's
been
no
interpretation
of
the
law
considering
this
rehabilitation
matter,
that
is
whether
that
would
wipe
out
his
requirement
for
registration.
that
has
never
been
brought
to
the
attention
of
anyone
or
nothing
has
ever
been
said
about
it
personally.
i
think
a
good
case
could
be
made
for
the
man
not
having
to
register
after
this
rehabilitation
has
taken
place.
and
as
far
as
the
probation,
it's
a
common
thing
to
expunge
the
record.
it's
done
everyday
in
los
angels.
our
old
friend
judge
(inaudible),
the
thing
is
so
common
that
the
court
attachés
gave
him
a
sponge
on
a
string
which
he
hangs
in
his
chambers
and
under
it
says
“to
expunge
the
record".
in
--
in
a
moment
of
mirth,
the
court
attachés
made
him
a
president.
it's
done
all
the
time.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
he
does
not
have
to
register
any
longer
and
that
fact
would
be
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
he's
been
registered.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
the
same
thing
that
happens
in
the
court
record.
when
the
record
is
expunged
with
another
--
another
record
made,
the
record
is
expunged.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
well,
you
just
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
--
you
never
tear
up
the
record.
the
record
is
still
there
and
they
--
they
note
that
the
record
has
been
expunged.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
the
court
attaché
should
do
it,
whether
it's
done
or
not,
i
don't
know.
the
man
can't
do
it.
i
have
had
a
--
my
attention
called
to
that
as
far
as
the
--
the
bureau
of
criminal's
--
the
criminal
identification
in
california
where
they
have,
what
we
call,
the
fbi
records.
you
notify
the
custodian
of
those
records
that
the
man's
criminal
record
has
been
expunged
on
that
what
we
call
the
wrap
sheet
on
the
--
in
the
other
--
in
--
in
the
last
column
that
the
record
expunged.
and
that
will
be
set
even
back
here
to
washington
to
the
fbi
records.
i
--
i
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
that
was
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes,
that's
true.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
well,
that's
what
i
say.
and
then
how
can
this
registration
with
the
police
department
be
unconstitutional
when
you've
got
it
in
four
or
five
other
places?
the
only
reason
it's
in
the
police
department
is
for
local
convenience.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
that's
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
that's
--
oh,
surely
that's
the
difference.
but
that
same
difference
appears
in
your
sex
registration
laws?
the
same
difference.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
well,
that'll
be
here
when
you
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
[laughs]
absolutely
in
this
case.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
well,
it's
a
matter
that
this
court
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
--
in
writing
an
opinion
will
undoubtedly
consider.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
i
will
undoubtedly
consider.
these
sex
registration
laws,
these
narcotic
registration
laws,
all
these
people
can
be
rehabilitated.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
i
--
i
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
i
think
--
i
think
it
--
it
does.
but,
your
honors
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
that's
--
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
no,
it
--
it
would.
there's
been
no
decision
on
it
but
i
will
say
this
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
--
that
a
long
period
of
administrative
--
carrying
out
of
this
law
shows
that
it
will
be
applied
to
those
who
come
from
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
that's
--
that's
one
of
the
advantages
of
california
and
its
entire
disadvantage
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
--
the
best
figures
that
we
have
available
on
that.
i
haven't
got
the
exact
figure
but
i
could
tell
you
that
the
los
angeles
district
attorney's
office
has
the
--
more
cases
filed
under
reciprocal
enforcement
of
support
act,
men
who
have
left
other
parts
of
the
country
and
left
their
wives
and
children
behind
and
to
start
life
anew
in
los
angeles
until
they
catch
up
with
them.
it
showed
that
the
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
it
is.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
but
i
say
that
shows
the
movement
of
people
who
would
violate
the
law.
and
that's
all
a
more
reason
why
it
should
apply
to
people
from
out
of
the
state.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
no.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
no.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
that
--
that
would
be
true
unless
they
stayed
back
home
to
--
to
get
some
sort
of
a
--
a
procedure.
we
shouldn't
be
blamed
for
that.
we
got
it
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
oh,
this
is
a
misdemeanor.
it's
--
it's
felonies
that
you'll
expunge
the
record.
for
misdemeanor
cases,
you
--
you
don't.
this
is
a
misdemeanor,
the
felony
cases
in
which
the
records
are
expunged.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
she
doesn't
have
to
register
under
this
conviction.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
she's
been
convicted.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
that's
true.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
just
the
same
as
my
traffic
payments.
they
still
stay
there
as
a
record
because
there
are
no
procedures
to
--
to
get
rid
of
that.
being
a
misdemeanor,
a
felony
once,
yes
you
can.
oh,
i
haven't
touched
on
the
subject
of
the
lack
of
intent.
that
no
intent
being
required
in
this
and
--
i
see
both
lights
on,
red
or
white,
but
i
would
like
to
--
to
explain
briefly
why
the
intent
isn't
necessary.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes.
the
intent
in
a
case
of
this
kind
is
similar
to
--
what
would
take
--
i'll
give
the
rule
briefly
as
it's
set
forth
in
the
--
in
the
morissette
case,
which
counsel
has
relied
upon.
in
that
case
--
we'll
first
come
to
balint
and
behrman,
two
united
states
supreme
court
cases,
dealing
with
narcotics,
does
regulatory
measures
in
exercise
on
what
is
called
the
police
power,
where
the
emphasis
of
the
statute
is
evidently
upon
achievement
of
some
social
betterment
rather
than
the
punishment
of
crimes
as
in
cases
mala
in
se.
no
intent
is
required
in
cases
of
that
kind
where
the
statute
is
a
regulatory
one
in
order
to
--
to
affect
some
public
purpose.
and
the
difference
was
pointed
out
in
the
morissette
case
which
affirmed
the
language
of
this
court
in
balint
and
behrman.
but
said
the
--
the
morissette
case,
they
said
intent
was
necessary
because
it
was
stealing
property
off
of
a
government
reservation.
and
they
said
stealing,
larceny
and
its
variance
and
equivalence
which
are
among
the
earliest
offenses
known
to
the
law
that
existed
before
legislatures.
in
other
words,
no
intent
is
necessary
for
the
violation
of
these
misdemeanors
set
up
by
local
legislatures
and
regulatory
matters.
but
intent
is
necessary
for
those
crimes
which
have
come
down
through
the
common
law
where
--
which
are
infamous
in
nature
and
therefore,
there
must
be
an
intent.
in
this
type
of
case,
the
intent
is
not
necessary
unless
the
legislature
particularly
puts
it
in.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
we're
ascertaining
that
register
because
--
to
be
convicted
of
a
felon
but
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
--
the
fact
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
that's
right.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
no,
but
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
but
i
think
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
--
intent
is
necessary
as
the
word,
the
legislature
put
it
in
willfully
and
knowingly
down
these
things
and
that
put
your
intent
in
but
if
it
wasn't
in,
i
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
well,
that
presumed
the
intent.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
that
presumed
the
intent
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
--
upon
the
doing
of
the
act.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
and
--
but
here,
any
of
these
felonies,
whether
it's
malum
per
se
--
malum
prohibitum
or
malum
or
otherwise,
you
must
register.
but
the
ordinance
requiring
the
registration
is
a
regulation
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
--
which
is
not
--
is
malum
prohibitum
and
therefore
no
intent
is
required
in
--
to
establish
a
violation
of
that
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
--
regulation.
