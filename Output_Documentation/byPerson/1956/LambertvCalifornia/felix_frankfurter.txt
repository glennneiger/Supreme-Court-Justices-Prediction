justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
be
good
enough
before
you
get
into
the
swing
of
your
argument
to
turn
to
the
actual
provisions
of
the
act
which
you
deemed
unconstitutional
and
where
it
is?
is
it
the
municipal
code
of
the
city
of
los
angeles
that
is
bad
according
to
your
view?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
is
it
--
is
it
the
california
penal
code
set
forth
in
several
pages,
the
whole
of
it
or
some
specific
provision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
whole
--
the
whole
ordinance
you
think?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
whole
section.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
what
about
--
is
that
--
is
that
provision
of
the
municipal
code
--
i
don't
know
anything
about
your
situation
out
there.
is
that
a
home
rule?
have
you
--
is
that
--
is
that
a
provision
which
the
city
of
los
angeles
is
authorized
to
make
in
carrying
out
some
state
statute
or
because
it
has
code
--
code-making
power?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what's
the
relation
of
that
provision
(inaudible)
to
the
appendix
b,
the
california
penal
code?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
our
--
your
attack
is
on
section
(inaudible)
and
not
on
any
provision
of
the
california
penal
code.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
the
fact
that
it
is
in
conflict
is
not
a
matter
for
us,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
--
is
the
opinion
to
which
you
referred
a
minute
ago,
the
one
that's
printed
in
page
29-30
of
the
record?
where
is
it?
is
that
it,
29
to
30,
that
little
memorandum
opinion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
you
tried
to
go
up
to
the
--
what
is
your
intermediate
--
what's
the
intermediate
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
you
tried
to
go
up
or
couldn't
you
go
up
on
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
at
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
you
--
do
you
mean
that
the
supreme
court
of
california
has
no
certiorari
upon
a
constitutional
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
it
happens
and
so
did
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
must
--
i
must
interrupt
you
again
to
ask
you
what
that
is,
what
is
meant
by
saying
in
that
opinion,
which
is
the
only
--
the
only
thing
we
have
here.
she
appeals
from
the
order
denying
a
new
trial
and
attempts
to
appeal
from
the
judgment,
although
there
is
no
judgment,
page
30.
however,
she
could
have
appealed
from
the
order
granting
probation
and
we
shall
consider
this
as
such
an
appeal.
is
there
any
question
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
this
is
a
final
judgment
for
purposes
of
the
federal
jurisdiction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand
that
it
can
be
the
law,
it
can
be
a
justice
of
the
peace
to
be
final
for
that
purpose
of
it,
so
far
as
the
highest
court
to
which
you
can
go,
but
all
this
time
that
they
--
informal
to
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
to
be
from
a
judgment,
although
there
is
no
judgment,
but
then
we'd
go
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
questioning
what
you
can
do
under
california
law.
i
am
interested
very
much
whether
it's
the
kind
of
a
judgment
that
is
a
judgment
for
our
purposes.
however,
don't
take
your
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
--
what
is
the
period
of
probation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
that
her
attorney
then
said
she'd
rather
be
confined
than
to
be
under
surveillance?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
was
the
time
of
her
confinement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
was
dismissed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
was
her
offense?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
what
is
the
--
it
may
become
important
to
our
jurisdiction.
what
is
the
--
the
allowable
punishment
for
that
offense?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words
--
and
that
may
become
important
as
to
what
the
consequences
of
--
was
there
a
formal
conviction
that
she
plead
guilty?
justice
felix
frankfurter
she
plead
guilty?
so,
there
was
a
formal
conviction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
--
on
the
both?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
what
consequences
did
that
have
apart
from
the
fact
that
she
could
be
in
jail
for
a
period
and
under
probation?
did
it
have
any
consequences
to
her
not
as
a
citizen?
thereby,
she's
seized
to
be
a
citizen?
is
she
allowed
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
she
allowed
to
have
--
is
she
denied
voting
thereafter?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
the
consequences?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
reason
i
ask
you
--
if
i
may
so
state
is
that
this
court
has
held
that
the
mere
fact
that
a
person
has
served
this
sentence
because
there's
nothing
more
to
serve.
it
doesn't
render
a
case
moot
and
therefore
beyond
our
jurisdiction
as
obtained
provided
that
consequences
of
that
conviction
continue
in
all
sorts
of
disability.
and
therefore,
i'm
asking
you
to
find
out
what's
the
disability,
what
disability
explode
from
that,
which
then
satisfy
the
fact
that
you've
got
a
real
interest
here
to
protect.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
as
a
result
of
this
conviction,
where
she
plead
guilty,
she
can't
vote
thereafter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
it's
important
for
me
at
least
to
know
if
there's
a
case
here
and
if
there's
no
living
problem.
if
she's
all
clear
then
there's
no
case
here.
well,
what
you
have
indicated
is
that
if
she's
denied
her
privileges
of
voting
and
is
denied
there
opportunity
to
work
for
the
state
that
--
those
are
continuing
disabilities,
which
makes
this
a
live
controversy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
she
--
was
she
also
fined
$250?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
she
fined?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
--
that's
my
difficulty.
you
stated
again
mainly
with
the
fact
that
she's
on
probation
in
this
case
is
the
kind
of
a
judgment
that
we
can
review.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
it
isn't,
but
it's
essential
to
find
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
would
you
mind
explaining
what
it
is
you
had
expunged?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
you
mean
at
the
time
she
was
convicted
that
felony
which
required
the
--
which
--
which
required
her
to
register
and
resulted
in
a
judgment
--
that
that
judgment
for
a
felony
was
gone?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
note
2?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
do
i
--
if
i
understand
you,
then
--
then
to
me
you
have
a
much
easier
--
i
believe
this
case
as
it
were.
so,
i
understand
you
that
this
petitioner
had
been
convicted
for
a
felony.
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
--
under
california
--
under
the
code,
she
would
have
to
register
because
she'd
been
convicted
for
a
felony.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
--
if
her
judgment
for
conviction,
her
sentence
had
been
set
aside
what
you
call
expunged
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
then
she
doesn't
have
to
register.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
you
are
saying
is
that
although
her
conviction
hadn't
been
a
conviction
for
felony,
hadn't
been
set
aside
at
the
time
she
was
arrested,
by
the
time
the
jury
had
to
bring
in
a
verdict
in
order
to
decide
whether
a
crime
was
committed,
she
was
no
longer
required
to
register.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
why
is
she
convicted
for
a
crime
that
doesn't
even
exist?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
don't
--
but
a
person
suffers
in
this
case,
only
the
view
of
the
court
or
district,
the
jury
said,
“you
committed
a
crime.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
at
the
time
they
say
that,
she
didn't
commit
a
crime.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
should
think
there's
a
general
law
that
if
a
statute
repealed
--
if
there's
a
repeal
of
a
statute
making
something
a
crime.
the
fact
that
she
committed
that
conduct
or
guilty
of
that
conduct,
admitted
that
act,
if
that
is
no
longer
a
crime
at
the
time
the
jury
comes
to
act
on
it
in
the
court
unless
you
have
any
--
a
direct
saving
clause
before
and
i
suppose
what
has
to
be
argued
here
that
this
very
inferior
court,
this
--
the
hierarchy
of
the
judiciary,
this
--
that
we
have
to
pass
only
on
a
statute
which
a
court
refers
to
in
an
appeal,
has
held
without
even
considering
the
problem
whether
a
conduct
of
which
no
longer
is
a
conduct
made
of
evil
offense
at
the
time
the
jury
comes
in
is
still
a
crime.
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
thought
it
couldn't
go
to
the
court
of
--
could
it
go
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
california,
i
inferred
from
that
as
a
california
statute,
you
said
this
is
--
well,
that
is
within
the
sweep
of
your
general
attack
on
this
kind
of
legislature,
is
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
has
the
--
the
california
supreme
court
has
passed
on
its
law,
hasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
do
we
get
construction?
is
there
any
light
to
be
shed
from
the
construction
of
the
state
law
upon
the
kind
of
things
that
we
have
before
us
in
this
ordinance?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
this
other
question
that
we
raised
earlier,
what
happens
if
in
fact
the
judgment
of
--
the
felony
sentence
had
been
lifted
before
the
--
the
defendant
comes
to
trial,
is
there
any
light
on
that
in
california?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
if
we
get
a
light
from
them,
from
the
supreme
court,
we
don't
have
to
take
what
a
law
--
what
a
very
inferior
court
tells
us
about
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
let
me
add
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
one
more
thing.
although,
it
applies
to
special
class
in
the
--
if
you
put
on
probation,
as
i
understood
your
answer
to
justice
whittaker,
you
said
that
automatically
the
probation
agent
moves
for
the
lifting
of
the
sentence,
but
that
is
not
--
that
is
not
a
compellable
motion
so
far
as
the
court
is
concerned.
may
the
court
say
no
in
this
case,
i
think.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
does
the
statute
automatically
require
that
if
a
defendant
is
convicted
and
then
put
on
probation,
thus
--
it
isn't
automatic
according
to
the
statute,
requires
judicial
action
whether
the
sentence
should
be
--
says
the
judgment
should
be
expunged,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
just
want
to
know
what
your
view
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
action
in
this
case
has
been
contrary.
the
action
in
this
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
--
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
--
i
noted
a
case
in
the
--
in
your
report.
the
division
in
--
in
--
under
california
--
under
this
court
of
appeals,
under
this
very
ordinance
--
the
conviction
under
this
very
ordinance
was
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
in
(inaudible)
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
not
by
way
of
direct
appeal
but
on
the
habeas
corpus.
now,
if
it
goes
--
if
you
invoke
habeas
corpus
on
the
ground
the
detention
was
fully
lawless,
that
is,
ultra
vires
without
jurisdiction.
you
can
go
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
take
it
up
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
get
a
construction
of
this
ordinance
that
way.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
should
think
if
his
claim
under
the
constitution
--
under
a
constitutional
claim
is
valid
that
would
be
a
fortiori.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
habeas
corpus
--
unless
your
state
is
very
different.
habeas
corpus
claim
there
is
no
legal
basis
for
detention.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
i
understand
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
think
habeas
corpus
wouldn't?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wouldn't
issue
if
there's
no
statute
on
which
any
conviction
could
be
had?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
and
therefore,
you
could
get
--
get
these
questions
raised
by
habeas
corpus
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
go
up
to
the
supreme
court,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
--
would
you
start
that
at
the
--
in
your
supreme
court
or
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
habeas
corpus
isn't
very
sticky
about
that.
persons
in
full
--
even
a
person
who
is
allowed
out
on
probation,
habeas
corpus
may
still
--
since
the
court
has
control
as
it
were,
habeas
corpus.
certainly,
that
objection
doesn't
apply
to
prohibition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
has
she
--
has
she
considered
nothing
more
for
the
court
to
do
or
is
there
anything
for
her
to
do?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean
then
there's
nothing
--
there's
nothing
left
in
the
case.
is
there
a
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
neither,
there
must
be
a
case
and
if
there's
something
left
then
there's
something
left
because
of
a
claim
that
the
court
--
there
is
outstanding
an
order
which
exceeded
the
authority
of
the
court
to
issue.
and
if
there
is
that
and
then
you
suggest
prohibition.
if
there
isn't
that,
there
is
no
case
anyhow.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
she
still
under
duty
to
pay
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
--
and
that
--
and
she's
under
duty
only
if
the
duty
could
be
imposed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
there
is
an
order
of
a
court
outstanding
which
is
either
valid
or
beyond
the
power
of
the
court.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
be
good
enough
to
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
you
were
about
to
say
something.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
i
understand
that.
that's
right.
would
you
be
good
enough
just
as
a
matter
of
curiosity
or
as
a
matter
of
enlightenment
to
state
without
--
doesn't
take
much
time
what
the
relation
between
the
state
statute
and
this
ordinance
is
if
any?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
does
it
come
of
more
roughly
stating
the
same
ground?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
substance?
justice
felix
frankfurter
sex.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
so
far
as
the
duty
to
register
if
you're
within
the
state
statute,
the
scheme
is
the
same,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
court's
action
isn't
exhausted
by
its
action.
it's
a
--
has
continuing
vitality
in
that
--
so
long
as
it
stands
and
nothing
is
done
about
it.
this
young
woman
is
subject
to
--
oversight
by
probation
and
the
payment
of
this
fine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
that
raises
the
question
of
constitutionality.
if
it's
unconstitutional,
the
statute
is
invalid
and
the
court
has
done
something
that
has
no
legal
validity,
whatever.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
a
piece
of
paper,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
can't
be
determined
until
it's
determined.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
--
we
had
a
similar
problem
in
a
case
coming
from
california.
what's
the
name
of
that,
there's
a
fight
--
filed
--
(inaudible)
was
is
it?
question
of
the
power
of
reviewing
the
determination
of
--
of
insanity
by
the
warden
of
a
penitentiary
and
at
that
time
the
attorney
general
or
somebody
speaking
for
him,
wasn't
it?
i
think
the
attorney
general
suggested
that
mandamus
of
prohibitions.
mandamus
is
a
good
--
available
remedy
and
acting
on
that
representation
being
the
purpose
of
the
state
by
the
attorney
general.
this
court
said,
well
there
is
relief
in
california.
it
has
since
turned
out
your
supreme
court
has
said
that
isn't
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there's
a
case
in
supreme
court,
portnoy
against
the
superior
court
by
chief
justice
gibson
which
shows
how
far
the
reach
of
your
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction
is
to
an
outsider,
an
ignoramus
like
myself
merely
reading
the
word.
i
think
it's
more
dangerous
or
for
me
less
confident
for
me
to
read
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
all
the
things
you've
mentioned,
all
these
contingencies.
despite
all
those
contingencies
this
is
a
final
judgment
for
purposes
of
this
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it
would
be
strange
indeed
if
it
weren't
a
final
judgment
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
subject
to
prohibition
which
you
indicate
by
your
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
christopher,
you
talked
as
though
the
right
of
privacy
is
in
the
constitution.
i
think
the
phrase
derived
from
the
--
unless
i'm
wrong,
you
can
correct
me,
but
i
think
the
phrase
was
used
by
justice
brandeis
where
it
had
pertinence,
namely,
his
objection
to
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
but
if
every
interference
with
what
one
doesn't
like
because
of
the
right
of
privacy
can
be
found
the
constitution.
i'm
not
saying
--
i'm
not
saying,
i'm
not
even
sympathetically.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
i
am
always
troubled
when
i
hear
these
phrases
that
i
don't
find
in
the
constitution
as
though
they
were
in
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
it's
a
narrow
mindedness
on
my
part
(inaudible)
to
have
you
prove
it
violates
the
first
amendment
rather
than
making
a
sympathy
before
you
prove
that
it
does.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
the
origination?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
these
very
prevalent?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
the
ordinances
in
substantial
form
(inaudible)
or
prevalent?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
giving
the
justification
in
destroying
it?
giving
the
justification
and
then
indicate
why
it
isn't
hold.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
giving
the
justification
for
legislation
that
it
is
--
that
is
as
wide
spread
as
this
and
then
indicate
why
there
is
no
justification
in
the
justification
that's
urged.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
merely
suggest
that
there
is
a
starting
point
of
validity
when
a
state
comes
in
its
past
legislation.
isn't
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
i
should
state
it
might
be
relevant
to
indicate
why
that
presumption
has
no
validity
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suggest
that
everything
you've
said
thus
far
offend
due
process,
if
you're
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
can
call
for
reply.
i
--
i
have
a
--
i
suppose
it's
bias
if
you
have
constitutional
questions
argued
with
reference
to
constitutional
provision
and
the
only
basis
on
which
you
are
here
is
due
process.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
i'm
not
following
the
--
your
argument.
i
understood
you
said
this,
now
offense
due
process.
i
suggest
that
everything
you've
said
thus
far
is
correct,
it
offends
due
process.
your
argument
is
correct
thus
far,
it
offends
due
process
and
nothing
else.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
trying
to
praise
you,
mr.
christopher.
and
it
wouldn't
be
the
first
time,
i've
done
it
in
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
feature
of
the
ordinance
also
common
in
the
other
cities,
namely,
that,
as
you
just
pointed
out
the
difficulties,
anybody
committed
anywhere
of
conduct
which,
according
to
california
would
be
a
felony,
comes
within
its
terms?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
just
general.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
attorney
general
agreed
that
that
is
the
construction,
as
a
fellow
who
comes
in
to
california
from
new
jersey
or
massachusetts
or
utah
must
decide
whether
what
he
was
convicted
of
is
a
felony
in
california.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
is
their
mode
of
instruction,
they
have
something
to
do
with
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
if
the
supreme
court
would
--
your
supreme
court
would
say,
“we
construe
it
that
way,”
that
would
take
the
case
out.
attorney
general
can
say,
“as
a
matter
of
policy,
that
is
--
that
is
the
way
they
construe.
it
might
make
a
difference.”
i
must
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it
seems
to
me
a
part
of
it
is
vulnerable
or
part
of
the
ordinance
is
anything
in
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
as
you
probably
know
this
court
is
accepting
the
responsible
statement
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
as
to
what
the
statute
means
and
what
he,
as
attorney
general,
advises
the
law
that
should
govern.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
there
any
civil
disability
drawing
from
the
conviction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
in
this
case
but
under
the
statute,
she
received
fixed
--
out
of
any
civil
disability
that
follow
imprisonment
for
six
months
in
california.
justice
felix
frankfurter
voting,
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
at
this
point?
you've
just
said
conviction
in
california,
if
i
caught
the
tone
of
your
voice
with
some
entity,
could
you
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
making
a
point
of
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
may
revert
to
my
prior
question.
when
either
you
or
mr.
linn
in
this
good
time
state
whether
the
state
of
california
asked
this
court
to
consider
the
ordinance
as
though
it
were
--
there
were
written
in
to
it
that
these
must
be
convictions
for
crimes
in
california.
the
convictions
must
be
with
regard
to
prosecutions
within
california.
either
you
or
mr.
linn
in
good
times
can
answer
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
just
made
a
point
of
it
in
your
statement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
from
what
you
argued,
the
law
has
--
the
law
has,
what
you
call,
justification
merely
in
regard
to
crimes
committed
outside
by
felons
or
equivalent,
outside
the
state
because
as
to
crime
within
the
state,
automatically,
the
conviction,
the
sentence
to
the
record
which,
in
the
various
counties
of
your
state,
it
could
be
passed
--
it
could
be
registered
in
some
central
register.
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
must
the
--
one
--
when
must
the
registration
be
--
when
must
be
registered?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
he
comes
out
of
jail.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can't
register
right
after
conviction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
the
point
--
is
the
point
then
is
the
point
of
the
statute
to
keep
track
of
people
after
they
come
out
of
jail?
is
that
the
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
more
than
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
after
they
have
served
their
sentence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
you
can
put
on
probation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
they
put
on
probation,
then,
automatically,
you
could
have
a
central
register
then
and
there,
couldn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean,
just
a
--
just
a
matter
of
bookkeeping.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
i
don't
mean
by
the
--
by
the
probationer
but
by
the
court
records.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
could
be
automatically
transferred
to
somewhere,
couldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
next
--
i
mean,
put
that
burden
on
him.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
order
to
keep
track,
is
that
what
we
are
keeping
facts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
to
--
what
is
it?
as
a
probation,
they
must
do
that
but
he
must
be
--
suppose
every
time
an
x
person
is
sentenced
for
two
years
and
he
then
registers
and
gives
his
address,
jones
street,
if
he
moves
from
jones
street,
must
he
reregister?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
continues
beyond
the
period
on
which
he
is
on
probation,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i'm
asking
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
the
case
of
a
man
who
served
two
years,
he
must
keep
this
up
for
the
rest
of
his
life?
is
that
right?
i'm
asking
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
must
the
--
must
the
governor?
that's
rather
ministerial
function.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
it
may
well
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
me
too.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
he's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
ask,
without
remotely
making
any
suggestion
that
might
be
drawn
from
the
questions
whether
i
may
assume
that
california
is
attracted
also
to
people
who
have
served
their
term
in
other
states
or
may
i
--
it
would
have
be
fanciful
to
say
this
may
hit
a
sufficiently
numerous
body
of
people
who
have
come
into
california
with
record,
with
criminal
record
from
other
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
to
make
any
suggestion
except
to
praise
the
climate
of
california.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
asking
this
because
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
was
just
informing
my
own
mind
on
--
on
the
applicability
which
i
understood
you
characteristic
--
characteristic
candor
admitted
applies
to
convictions
anywhere
outside
of
california.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
i
don't
want
to
make
an
assumption
that's
unreal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
you
--
you
state
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
i
may
assume
it's
not
fanciful
that
a
lot
of
people
or
sufficiently
numerous
body
of
people
will
go
to
california
to
start
life
a
new
as
they've
always
have
in
the
history
of
california.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
an
offense
in
a
good
many
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
criminal
offense,
not
merely
a
civil
requirement
of
paying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
people
have
gone
to
jail
for
five
years
without
any
--
despite
the
absence
of
knowledge
that
they
were
violating
the
narcotics
law
and
this
accorded
the
state
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
means
they
don't
have
to
have
them?
