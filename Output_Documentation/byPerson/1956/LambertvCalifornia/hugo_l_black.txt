justice
hugo
l.
black
where
did
that
conviction
occur?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
not
appealing
from
there,
aren't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
getting
to
the
facts
of
the
case
she'd
be
charged
with
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'd
like
to
hear
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
she's
charged
with?
what
she's
convicted
for
and
what's
happened
to
her?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
this
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question
about
your
facts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
if
she
was
arrested
for
failing
to
register,
that
if
she
was
tried
for
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
requested
four
days
trial
order.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
whether
or
not
she
could
writ
and
was
she
convicted
by
the
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
right,
then
what
did
the
judge
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
that
is
--
that's
the
probation
that's
referred
to
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
on
page
30?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
the
court
said
that
she
could
have
appealed
from
the
probation
order
in
this
case
for
failing
to
register,
but
that
she
hasn't
done
that,
but
however,
they
would
consider
this
an
appeal
in
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
say
that
that's
wrong.
you
challenged
the
whole
thing
on
the
ground
that
the
ordinance
is
unconstitutional.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
what
you
--
what
you
have
against
though
is
this,
isn't
it?
the
state
of
california's
highest
court
which
had
passed
on
it
says
that
the
statute
made
it
a
crime
not
to
register
and
that
the
mere
fact
that
after
the
arrest
occurred,
the
crime
was
--
a
charge
was
made.
the
charge
for
the
first
crime
was
set
--
the
conviction
was
set
aside.
it
didn't
change
that
you
--
under
california
law,
we
must
decide
still
the
question
that
they
have
presented,
i
would
suppose,
whether
this
is
not
a
different
statute
because
you
--
you
violated
the
statute
as
they
construed
ordinance,
as
they
construed
in
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
construe
it
as
applying
to
your
case
because
at
the
time
she
was
arrested,
she
was
guilty
at
that
time
of
violating
that
ordinance.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
made
that
contention
to
the
judge
and
he
overruled
it,
didn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
but
that's
so
extraordinary.
i'm
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
she
decided
jail
was
better
than
the
probation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
statute
are
you
talking
about
now
as
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
when
does
it
require
them
to
report
for
life?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
part
of
the
statute
does
that
in
section
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
wait
a
minute,
is
that
in
your
brief,
(inaudible)
is
that
in
your
brief?
have
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what
about
the
ordinance?
is
it
in
your
--
either
in
one
of
the
briefs?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
brief
of
the
respondent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
52.40?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
does
it
stay
for
the
rest
of
their
life?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
no
provision
in
any
of
the
sections
that
indicates
that
sometimes
this
--
you
didn't
register
to
keep
on
reporting
in?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
--
suppose
she's
convicted
in
another
state,
where
they
do
not
expunge
the
record.
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
the
court
held
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
those
convictions
in
los
angeles?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
people
who
live
in
los
angeles,
convicted
in
los
angeles
required
to
register
also?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
that
a
registration
in
the
court.
i
--
i
just
wondered
about
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
they
--
were
they
properly
raised
under
california
procedure?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
i'm
asking
was,
this
court
might
have
one
procedure
and
they
might
have
another.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
he
--
did
he
properly
raise
this
constitutional
point
under
california
procedure?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
to
what
section?
5239?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
--
where
this
has
been
raised
properly
in
your
state
court
and
they
have
--
this
--
this
court
has
denied
them
on
the
ground
that
it's
--
that
it
is
constitutional.
could
he
raise
that
same
question
under
california
procedure,
under
habeas
corpus
petition?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
not
be
barred
by
the
former
adjudication?
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
though
it's
been
denied
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
that
you
somewhat
to
the
fact
that
they're
not
allowed
to
take
this
kind
of
case
up
to
the
supreme
court
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
the
first
instance?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
consider
that
the
challenge
here
raises
the
question
as
to
those
other
requirement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
constitutionality
of
what?
the
requiring
that
they
register
or
the
information
they're
supposed
to
give?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
they
register
without
giving
this
other
information,
being
fingerprinted
and
the
other
requirements?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
possible
to
register
without
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
can
they
register
without
it?
that's
what
i'm
--
is
that
a
part
of
the
registration?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
to
comply
with
in
order
to
register?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
to
register
though
--
i'm
not
sure
but
i
suppose
you
have
a
form
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
they
have
to
sign
and
everything
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
have
to
be
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
i
ask
you
one
other
question
about
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
prohibition
because
that
is
inquired
in
here.
would
she
have
to
surrender
herself
in
order
to
file
a
writ
of
prohibition?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
--
are
you
sure
that
can
be
done?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
there
any
decisions
that
hold
it
can
be
done?
justice
hugo

black
suppose
this
case
should
be
decided
in
favor
of
the
city
or
on
that
ground
or
something
of
that
kind.
are
we
to
understand
that
she
could
without
subjecting
herself
to
going
to
jail
or
paying
this
$250
penalty,
get
the
advantage
of
the
--
exactly
what
she
is
raising
here
by
a
writ
of
prohibition
asking
for
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
question
i
asked
you
was
could
she
seek
a
writ
of
prohibition
without
having
to
pay
that
$250
or
go
to
jail
in
lieu
of
payment?
justice
hugo

if
you
don't
have
any
lieu
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
provision
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
attorney
general
represent
it
thereto?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
wouldn't
have
authority
then
to
represent
the
views
of
the
attorney
general
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
along
this
question
of
her
remedy
in
case
she
lost
that
here?
justice
hugo

black
or
you
could
--
you
could
thereby
get
the
--
get
a
ruling
of
your
supreme
court,
could
you
not
or
could
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
know?
justice
hugo

black
is
it
a
misdemeanor
or
a
felony
(inaudible)
justice

black
what's
the
punishment?
justice
hugo

black
for
how
long?
justice

what
were
the
conditions
of
the
probation?

how
did
that

i
noticed
that.
how
did
that
--
i
was
just
a
little
curious.
actually,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
she's
convicted
of
forgery
only?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
she
convicted
of
the
first
time?
justice
hugo

black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
this
probation.
conditions
were
that
she
violated
no
law
dealing
with
public
health,
with
public
wealth
or
moral.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
just
curious.
has
she
been
convicted
of
any
offense
which
indicated
that
she
might
violate
the
morals
of
the
community,
anything
like
that
except
what
her
forgery
was,
did
that
come
in
that
definition?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
objection
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
is
there
any
objection
in
the
records
of
the
terms
of
the
probation
or
having
no
relation
to
the
offense
for
which
she's
been
committed
--
for
which
she's
been
convicted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
had
started
arguing
that
it
was
unreasonable.
i
--
i
--
is
your
only
argument
is
about
unreasonableness
that
she
was
fined
$250?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that
demurrer
raised
in
the
constitutional
question?is
it
in
the
record
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
the
demurrer
on
which
sets
out
the
ground
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
place
anywhere
which
points
out
the
particular
objection
that
was
raised
to
the
constitutionality
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
vagueness?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
did
enough
to
show
that
it's
a
felony
in
california,
committed
elsewhere
to
show
that
it
punishes.
that
defense
is
punishable
in
california
by
more
than
a
year.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
kept
saying
something
that
if
it's
the
type
of
crime
that
has
been
made
of
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
precise?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
rather
--
that's
rather
difficult
(inaudible)
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
the
state
has
given
him
something
in
finding
out
whether
it's
a
felony
under
the
laws
of
california,
i
should
think
of
defendant
(inaudible)
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
didn't
quite
understand.
you
said
he
was
precluded
from
getting
a
job.
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
he
precluded
by
law
or
just
precluded
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
just
precluded
because
they
wouldn't
want
to
take
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
time
was
up
but
there's
one
other
question
i
want
to
--
i
don't
know
if
it
makes
any
difference
in
the
point
you've
raised.
from
your
brief,
i
gather,
you've
argued
quite
a
different
point
with
reference
to
notice.
is
that
what
you
put
in
here?
you
offered
to
prove,
as
i
understand,
that
this
law
which
required
registration
of
conviction
of
a
felony
was
a
law
that
was
not
clear
and
what
a
felony
was.
the
definition
of
a
felony
in
california
was
one
that
was
so
vague
and
ambiguous.
it
frequently
would
require
proof
of
some
kind
and
study
an
investigation
to
determine
whether
a
person's
act
was
a
felony.
you
offered
to
prove,
as
i
recall
it,
during
the
trial
that
she
did
not
know
whether
the
offense
which
she
committed
was
a
felony
or
not
a
felony.
you
were
raising
a
point
there
not
that
--
not
saying
that
you
were
challenging
the
idea
that
a
person
was
presumed
to
know
the
law,
i
mean,
in
that
favor,
but
that
they
couldn't
be
presumed
to
know
so
as
to
fasten
criminal
guilt
on
the
meaning
of
a
felony
when
it
was
obscure
as
it
was
in
california.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
said
in
--
in
this
aspect
of
it
that
you
are
arguing
and
as
i
gather
your
brief,
you've
cited
some
cases
which
i
haven't
read
where
--
that
under
those
circumstances
if
the
vagueness
and
ambiguity
of
that
face
of
the
law
which
makes
--
brings
it
in
conflict
with
due
process
because
of
the
fact
that
the
person
can't
know
that
whether
there's
any
duty
on
them
to
register
or
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
saying
that
came
as
your
case
but
it
seems
to
me
that's
an
addition,
additional
argument
which
--
which
you
made
and
was
presented
to
the
trial
judge
while
the
case
was
in
trial.
