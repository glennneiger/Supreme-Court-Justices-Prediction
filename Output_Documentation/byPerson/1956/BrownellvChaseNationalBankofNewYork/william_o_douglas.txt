is
there
a
contingent
remainder
here
that
--
justice
william
o.
douglas

you
coming
to
that?
justice
william
o.

court
was
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
was
not
sure
about
an
heir,
tell
--
tell
that
you
had
vested
that.
justice
william
o.
douglas

--
you
--
you
vest
also
the

you
said
you

i
suppose
if
there

a
trust,
setting
up
two
life
estates,
one
to
an
american
--
to
a
national
of
this
country,
one
to
an
alien
enemy.
under
your
argument,
would
the
attorney
general
to
have
the
power
to
take
over
the
whole
trust?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
our
--
our
national
interest
would
be
protected
to
that
kind
of
order,
would
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
--
the
national
interest
of
the
--
this
country
would
be
protected
to
that
kind
of
order,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
germans
wouldn't
get
the
property.
no
alien,
no
enemy
would
get
the
property.
justice
william
o.
douglas
why
doesn't
the
order
of
this
new
york
court
protect
you
fully?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
said,
why
doesn't
it.

justice
william
o.
douglas

it
cuts
it
off
from

to
the
alien
enemies.

of
you
reply
brief,
it
--
you
refer
--
the
court
refers
to
the
claim
for
the
entire
principles.
that
would
indicate
the
opposite
of
what
you've
just
said.
justice
william

douglas
your
reply
brief,
seven
lines
from
the
--
six
lines
from
the
top
of
the

justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
that
seems
to
be
talking
in
terms
of
the
res.
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
entire
principle
would
seem
to
be
--
justice
william

you.
justice
william
o.
douglas
because
it
was
an
alien.
justice
william

me,
go
ahead.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
then,
what
new
or
different
property
interest
did
he
try
to
vest
in
the
second
order?
justice
william
o.
douglas
legal
type.
justice
william
o.
douglas
your
claim
is
that
cutting
of
that
--
the
exercise
of
that
power
which
protects
public
liens.
justice
william
o.
douglas
when
will
these
people
seize
being
alien
enemies?
when
would
this
thing
come
to
an
end?
when
would
this
be
over
with?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
they
weren't,
because
they
had
peace
then
on
germany.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes,
that's
what
i'm
referring
to.
justice
william
o.
douglas
how
long
was
this
run,
could
you
--
could
you
have
a
vesting
order
of
10
years
from
the
date
of
the
joint
resolution?
justice
william
o.
douglas
mr.
searls
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
of
attending
an
event
--
well,
you
have
--
that's
assuming
that
the
claimants
want
out,
but
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
while
the
suit
is
pending?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and

no
discretion
at
all?
