mr.
george
b.
searls
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
results
from
the
refusal
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york
to
order
delivery
to
the
attorney
general
of
property
which
the
attorney
general,
as
successor
to
the
alien
property
custodian,
had
vested
under
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act.
the
questions
presented
turn
on
the
provisions
of
a
trust
indenture.
on
the
provisions
of
a
judgment
entered
in
an
earlier
suit
in
1948,
as
well
as
upon
the
judgment
which
is
under
review
here.
the
property
is
held
by
the
respondent
chase
bank
under
an
indenture
which
was
executed
in
1928.
the
real
settlor
on
the
trust
was
the
respondent
bruno
reinicke,
although
one
cobb
was
the
nominal
settlor.
the
trust
is
spendthrift
trust
for
the
primary
benefit
of
reinicke's
children.
and
after
the
death
of
reinicke
and
his
wife,
the
property
is
to
be
divided
equally
among
the
children
as
they
reach
certain
ages
with
provision
for
their
children
taking
the
share
of
any
child
who
dies
before
the
time
of
distribution.
except
as
otherwise
directed,
the
trustee
is
to
accumulate
the
income
for
the
lives
of
reinicke
and
his
wife.
but
the
indenture
gave
reinicke
authority
to
direct
the
payment
of
the
income
either
to
the
children
or
to
himself
or
to
someone
else
for
the
benefit
of
the
children.
also,
if
he
notified
the
respondent,
the
bank
that
he
had
returned
to
the
united
states
and
was
intended
to
become
a
resident,
then
he
could
direct
the
trustee
to
pay
him
personally
half
of
the
income.
in
addition,
he
had
extensive
powers
of
supervision
over
the
management
of
the
trust
and
over
trust
policy.
now,
in
1945,
the
then
alien
property
custodian
issued
a
vesting
order
number
4551
which
is
in
the
record
at
pages
67
to
72,
in
which
he
found
that
reinicke,
his
wife
and
his
children
and
a
number
of
other
people
names
were
nationals
of
a
designated
enemy
country,
germany.
and
by
that
order,
he
vested,
"all
right,
title,
interest
or
claim
--
and
claim
of
each
of
the
persons
named
and
into
the
trust."
acting
on
that
vesting
order,
the
alien
property
custodian
and
later
the
attorney
general
as
his
successor
intervened
in
a
suit
for
instructions
which
the
trustee
had
brought
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york.
and
on
the
basis
of
the
vesting
order,
the
government
asked
that
the
state
court
order
the
trustee
to
pay
over
the
income
to
the
attorney
general
that
an
order
also
be
made
that
the
trustee
deliver
on
the
termination
of
the
trust,
the
shares
of
the
persons
whose
interest
had
been
vested
and
also
for
a
determination
that
by
reason
of
the
vesting
order,
he
had
succeeded
to
certain
powers.
the
attorney
general
had
succeeded
the
certain
powers
over
the
trust.
the
judgment
went
against
the
attorney
general.
it
was
entered
on
january
30th,
1948
and
is
in
the
record
beginning
at
page
211.
the
court
held
that
the
attorney
general
had
not
succeeded
to
reinicke's
powers
over
the
management
of
the
trust
or
to
his
powers
to
direct
the
payment
of
income.
and
that
he
was
not
entitled
to
receive
the
income.
as
to
those
powers
which
had
been
subject
to
--
as
to
the
powers
which
reinicke
had
had
to
control
the
management
and
conduct
of
the
trust,
the
court
held
that
the
trustee
was
authorized
to
administer
the
trust
in
his
discretion
for
such
period
as
reinicke's
powers
should
be
subject
to
governmental
control
in
the
form
of
barking
or
other
controls
either
in
this
country
or
in
germany.
on
appeal,
the
appellate
division
affirmed
saying
that
the
vesting
order
did
not
indicate
an
intention
to
appropriate
fiduciary
powers.
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
--
one
judge
dissented.
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
affirmed
without
opinion.
that
was
in
1950.
in
1953,
april
6,
the
attorney
general
amended
vesting
order
4551
and
the
amendment
is
in
the
record
beginning
at
page
53.
the
amendment
struck
out
the
right,
title
and
interest
vesting
order
and
substituted
what
the
case's
term
a
recent
vesting
order.
that
is
the
order
stated
that
there
is
hereby
vested
in
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
the
trust
property,
that
is
the
property
which
is
described
in
the
order
as
follows.
"all
property
in
the
possession,
custody
or
control
of
the
respondent,
chase
bank,
as
trustee
under
the
1928
indenture.‚Äù
now
again,
that
amendment
in
that
order
of
april
1953,
the
attorney
general
made
findings,
he
found
that
reinicke,
his
wife,
the
children
and
other
persons
named
in
the
order
were
and
had
been
prior
to
january
1,
1947
nationals
of
a
designated
enemy
country,
germany.
and
he
also
found
that
the
trust
property
was
property,
which
is
and
prior
to
january
1,
1947
was
owned
or
controlled
by
and
held
on
behalf
of
or
on
account
of
those
enemy
nationals.
the
respondent,
the
chase
bank,
brought
another
suit
for
instructions
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
which
it
named
as
defendants
the
attorney
general,
reinicke,
his
wife,
his
children
and
other
people
who
might
be
supposed
to
have
some
interest.
the
complaint
set
up
the
1948
judgment
and
alleged
that
the
vesting
of
the
trust
fund,
that
is
the
1953
vesting,
was
illegal.
the
attorney
general
answered
that
by
the
amendment,
he
had
become
entitled
to
the
immediate
possession
of
the
property
and
he
prayed
judgment
accordingly.
his
answer
also
stated
that
the
only
relief
that
could
be
granted
against
the
amendment
was
under
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
in
a
district
court
of
the
united
states.
the
relief
requested
by
the
attorney
general
was
denied.
the
court
wrote
a
rather
extensive
decision,
which
is
in
the
record
beginning
i
think
at
page
150
and
the
short
opinion.
the
court
held
that
the
trustee
was
entitled
to
continue,
to
hold
and
administer
the
property.
it
made
findings
that
in
the
prior
suit,
the
attorney
general
had
requested
an
order
for
delivery
of
the
shares,
which
he
had
vested
upon
determination
of
the
trust
and
that
for
a
determination
that
he
had
succeeded
to
reinicke's
powers.
the
court
also
said
that
in
the
prior
suit,
the
attorney
general
had
requested
an
order
for
the
transfer
of
the
principle
on
the
ground
that
all
interest
in
the
trust
had
vested
in
him
by
reason
of
vesting
order
4551.
the
court
found,
and
i
am
speaking
now
still
of
the
findings
from
the
present
suit,
that
the
1948
judgment
decided
that
the
powers
claimed
by
the
attorney
general
were
not
vested
in
him.
it
also
made
a
finding
that
the
respondent,
infant-respondent,
hans
dietrich
schaefer
is
an
american
citizen
born
in
1953
and
that
he
has
a
contingent
interest
in
the
trust
and
may
become
entitled
to
the
entire
fund
upon
its
termination.
that
judgment
was
affirmed
by
the
appellate
division
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york,
denied
leave
to
appeal.
our
position
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
it's
not
very
clear,
your
honor.
in
the
complaint,
they
alleged
--
set
up
a
number
of
paragraphs
to
the
1948
judgment
and
then
they
say
that
the
vesting
was
illegal,
but
they
do
not
draw
any
distinct
connection
between
the
two.
mr.
george
b.
searls
yes,
they
alleged
that
also.
they
--
there
as
they
alleged
that
schaefer
exists
and
has
a
claim
to
the
trust.
mr.
george
b.
searls
we
think,
your
honor,
that
by
the
1953
order,
we
took
the
property
itself
regardless
of
what
claims
there
may
be
to
it.
mr.
george
b.
searls
the
trustee,
what,
your
honor?
mr.
george
b.
searls
no,
that's
correct.
mr.
george
b.
searls
we
found
that
frankly
all
of
the
beneficiary,
there
is
in
the
order
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
--
where
nationals
are
designated
enemy
country.
mr.
george
b.
searls
yes,
or
it
were.
mr.
george
b.
searls
were
enemy
nationals.
mr.
george
b.
searls
that
is
schaefer.
he
is
not
mentioned
in
the
amendment
because
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
was
born
some
months
after
the
order
was
issued.
mr.
george
b.
searls
no,
your
honor.
mr.
george
b.
searls
he
was
in
the
--
the
decision
of
the
1954,
he
was
born
in
august
of
1953.
now,
our
position
is
that
the
court
erred
in
denying
the
order
of
question
by
the
attorney
general
for
delivery
of
the
property.
in
that,
the
1953
order
was
a
res
vesting
as
that
term
is
used
in
the
case.
and
that
by
such
an
order,
the
attorney
general
becomes
entitled
to
the
immediate
possession
of
the
property
and
that
in
a
proceeding
involving
his
claims
of
possession,
his
findings
of
enemy
status
and
enemy
ownership
are
conclusive.
and
that
the
existence
of
a
claim
to
the
property
is
no
defense
to
such
proceeding.
that
as
we
read
it
is
what
this
court
has
held
in
a
line
of
cases
most
recently
in
the
in
singer
case,
brownell
against
singer
and
the
second
zittman
case
and
in
other
cases
dating
back
to
1921.
and
that
is
based,
as
we
read
the
decisions,
on
the
language
of
the
statute
itself.
section
7
(c)
provides
that
if
the
president
shall
so
require,
property
which
he
has
determined
to
be
enemy
owned
shall
be
transferred
to
the
alien
property
custodian.
and
section
5
(b)
as
amended
in
1941,
said
that
any
property
shall
vest
when
as
and
upon
the
terms
prescribed
by
the
president.
as
we
read
the
opinion
and
decision
of
the
new
york
court,
it
seems
to
have
gone
upon
two
main
grounds.
the
first
place,
it
seems
to
have
held
or
felt
that
the
1948
judgment
in
some
way
precluded
the
attorney
general's
assertion
of
his
rights
in
this
proceeding.
that
in
some
way
that
made
his
rights
res
iudicata.
and
the
second
reason
seems
to
have
been
the
existence
of
the
contingent
claim
of
schaefer
to
the
trust.
as
to
the
first
reason,
it
seems
to
us
clear
that
this
is
not
a
case
of
res
iudicata,
cannot
be.
in
the
primary
sense
of
that
term,
that
is
--
and
that
the
prior
judgment
is
an
absolute
bar
to
this
suit.
and
i
say
that
because
as
we
read
the
record
and
the
cases,
a
cause
of
action
or
the
claim
in
the
prior
suit
and
the
cause
of
action
and
the
claim
here
of
the
attorney
general
are
entirely
different.
in
the
first
suit,
the
attorney
general
was
proceeding
on
the
basis
of
a
right,
title
and
interest
vesting,
by
which
he
vested
the
rights
of
bruno
reinicke
and
the
other
people
mentioned.
and
he
claimed
that
he
was
entitled
to
whatever
reinicke
was
entitled
to
as
a
successor
in
interest.
in
the
two
zittman
cases,
this
court
discussed
the
discussion
between
rights,
title
and
interest
in
res
vesting
orders.
and
in
the
second
zittman
case,
the
court
said
that
by
a
right,
title
and
interest
vesting
order,
the
custodian
puts
himself
in
the
place
of
the
person
whose
interest
he
has
vested.
and
he
leaves
open
to
judicial
determination
what
his
rights
are.
or
as
judge
hand
put
it
in
miller
against
rau,
one
of
the
early
cases
under
the
act,
a
right,
title
and
interest
order
substitutes
the
alien
property
custodian
or
the
beneficiary.
and
then
he
has
to
work
out
his
rights
under
the
will
or
as
here
under
the
trust
indenture.
the
present
suit
however
is
a
suit
to
enforce
a
res
vesting
order.
the
property
vested
by
the
amendment
of
1953
is
not
the
right,
title
and
interest
of
bruno
reinicke
or
of
anyone
else.
it
is
the
property
itself,
all
property
in
the
possession,
custody
or
control
of
the
chase
bank
under
the
1928
vesting
order.
and
that
distinction
between
the
two
types
of
vesting
order
also
goes
back
to
a
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
george
b.
searls
a
contention
of
what,
your
honor?
mr.
george
b.
searls
that's
right,
your
honor,
schaefer's
interest.
mr.
george
b.
searls
we
have
vested
schaefer's
interest.
mr.
george
b.
searls
we
have
issued
a
vesting
of
the
res
itself
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
well,
your
honor,
i
would
have
to
reconsider.
we
--
i
am
not
sure
about
that
because
there
is
some
language
in
the
--
one
of
the
vesting
orders
about
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
--
unborn
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
what?
mr.
george
b.
searls
well,
i
have
to
refer
to
the
language
of
the
amendment.
what
i
--
what
had
occurred
to
me
was,
there
may
be
some
language
in
there
about
unborn
heirs.
i
don't
know
what
the
effect
of
that
would
be.
mr.
george
b.
searls
the
only
amendment
is
this
one
in
1953
which
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
that's
right.
we
have
not
--
the
language
is
on
page
54.
we
vest
the
interest
of
johann,
mariah,
margaret,
elizabeth
reinicke,
who
is
schaefer's
mother.
his
are
not
her
interest
rhyming
she
is
named
as
one
of
the
owners.
and
he
would
not
take
unless
he
survives
his
mother,
otherwise
that
share
would
go
to
her.
mr.
george
b.
searls
to
the
vest
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
that's
right,
your
honor.
that
is
section
9
(a)
and
it
was
on
that
ground
that
the
courts
have
in
the
past
enforced
these
orders
that
there
is
an
adequate
remedy.
i
had
proposed
to
discuss
that
little
later
when
i
come
to
schaefer's
claim.
mr.
george
b.
searls
is
that
on
page
54,
your
honor?
mr.
george
b.
searls
child
or
children
of
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
--
of
bruno
reinicke.
mr.
george
b.
searls
well,
by
this
order,
your
honor,
because
we
don't
vest
any
person's
interest.
we
vest
the
property
itself.
these
are
merely
people
named
as
owners.
mr.
george
b.
searls
i
said
i
wasn't
sure
then
whether
schaefer
was
named
and
i
meant
i
wasn't
sure
whether
schaefer
was
referred
in
the
order
because
there
is
sometimes
in
these
orders
language
about
unknown
heirs
or
unborn
heirs.
but
i
don't
think
there's
anything
in
here
that
would
describe
him.
mr.
george
b.
searls
what
defense?
mr.
george
b.
searls
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
a
question
whether
his
interest
is
not
so
remote
that
it
would
not
justify
a
recovery
under
that
section.
i
propose
to
come
to
that.
i
want
to
created
a
--
this
claim
at
one
point
in
the
argument.
now,
their
res
vesting
order
which
is
based
on
the
language
of
the
statute
that
the
custodian
may
seize
property
or
he
may
seize
rights
and
--
or
claims.
and
that
likewise,
he
may
vest
property
or
he
may
vest
interest.
and
by
a
res
vesting,
as
we
have
--
as
i
read
the
decisions
of
the
court
as
i
have
mentioned.
the
attorney
general
becomes
entitled
to
immediate
possession
regardless
of
the
validity
or
the
quantum
of
the
interest
or
rights
of
the
person
who
is
named
as
an
owner.
as
the
court
--
this
court
put
it
in
the
second
zittman
case
by
such
an
order,
the
custodian
steps
into
the
shoes
of
the
possessor
of
the
property,
that
is
with
respect
to
the
right
to
possession
and
not
rather
into
the
shoes
of
the
beneficiaries.
now,
by
a
right,
title
and
interest
vesting
order,
we
may
not
be
entitled
possession
if
the
person
whose
rights
we
have
vested
is
not
entitled
the
possession.
i
think
the
--
another
difference
between
the
two
types
of
order
can
be
illustrated
by
the
proof
required
in
suits
to
enforce
them.
in
a
res
vesting
order
as
the
courts
have
held,
all
that
the
custodian
or
the
attorney
general
has
to
show
is
to
produce
the
order
and
possibly
to
identify
the
property
or
show
that
it's
in
existence,
that
that's
contested.
in
a
right,
title
and
interest
vesting
order
however,
he
has
to
prove
whatever
the
person
whose
interest
he
has
vested
would
have
had
to
prove.
he
may
have
to
prove
that
that
person
is
an
heir
or
that
he's
a
legatee
or
a
beneficiary
or
what
his
rights
are
under
a
contract.
and
he
show
the
nature
and
extent
of
the
rights
that
he
has
taken.
the
attorney
general's
cause
of
action
when
he
sues
to
enforce
an
order
depends
upon
the
forum
of
the
order
he
has
issued.
in
the
absence
of
a
vesting
order,
he
has
no
right
in
any
property,
whether
enemy
owned
or
not.
and
the
rights
for
his
claim,
he
defines
in
his
order.
mr.
george
b.
searls
he
would
have
power,
your
honor,
but
i
--
my
point
of
that
in
--
that
has
been
the
usual
practice
in
a
state's
matters
particularly
where
it
was
claimed
to
be
an
intermixture
of
enemy
and
none
in
this
property
to
issue
a
right,
title
and
interest
vesting
order
at
least
initially.
and
it
is
only
in
cases
like
the
present
one
where
that
order
proves
fruitless
or
is
not
complied
with
or
other
action
was
taken.
we
only
vested
initially
the
right,
title
and
interest
to
the
various
people
named.
and
under
that
order,
we
would
not
have
been
entitled
to
any
of
the
principle
until
after
the
death
of
reinicke
and
his
wife
and
becoming
of
the
children
to
the
various
ages.
but
the
court
in
the
former
suit
didn't
even
find
we're
entitled
to
that.
mr.
george
b.
searls
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
george
b.
searls
well
the
custodian
tries
to
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
the
former
owner,
your
honor
doesn't
say
that
we
get
anything.
it
leaves
it
entirely
up
in
the
air.
it
says,
‚Äúwhat
we
don't
get.‚Äù
it
does
not
say
if
we
got
anything
as
i
read
it.
mr.
george
b.
searls
does
it?
mr.
george
b.
searls
because,
your
honor,
it
doesn't
say
that
we
got
anything.
mr.
george
b.
searls
are
you
referring
--
i'm
not
sure
whether
appointed.
mr.
george
b.
searls
the
present
order?
mr.
george
b.
searls
no,
all
the
present
order
provides
us
that
we're
to
get
60
days
notice
of
any
distribution.it
doesn't
say
what
will
happen
then.
all
we
get
is
a
notice.
mr.
george
b.
searls
except
after
60
days,
notice
does.
it
doesn't
--
except
in
that
--
except
for
that,
it
doesn't
cut
it
off.
mr.
george
b.
searls
that's
all
we
get.
and
then
they
can
sue
and
determine
their
rights
under
section
9
(a).
mr.
george
b.
searls
that's
correct,
your
honor.
now,
as
of
1948,
the
attorney
general
had
not
exercised
his
authority
to
vest
the
res.
he
didn't
have
to.
the
two
types
of
order
are
separate
and
distinct
and
sometimes
one
is
used
and
sometimes
the
other.
the
--
he
doesn't
have
to
issue
a
right,
title
and
interest
vesting
order
in
order
to
issue
a
res
vesting
order
later.
the
two
are
entirely
separate.
we
think
it's
clear,
as
a
matter
of
interpretation
of
the
act
and
it's
a
matter
of
general
law,
this
isn't
a
case
of
res
judicata
in
the
primary
sense
of
that
word.
the
new
york
court
seems
to
have
felt
however
that
there
might
be
some
kind
of
a
collateral
estoppel.
and
that
perhaps
the
attorney
general
had
actually
put
in
issue
in
the
prior
suit
his
authority
to
vest
the
res.
and
the
--
the
decision
had
been
against
him,
although
his
claim
did
not
depend
in
that
suit
upon
any
such
authority.
the
court
found
this
on
page
159
of
the
record
and
in
the
prior
suit,
it
had
been
determined
that
the
powers
claimed
by
the
attorney
general
over
the
trust
were
not
vested
in
him.
but
i
think
if
the
court
will
look
at
the
prior
pages,
157
and
158,
it
will
find
that
what
that
sentence
i
have
just
referred
to
means
is
that
the
custodian
had
not
taken
over
by
the
right,
title
and
interest
vesting
order,
the
powers
of
bruno
reinicke
over
the
management
of
the
trust
or
his
power
to
direct
the
payment
of
income.
those
are
the
powers
with
respect
to
which
the
court
in
the
1948
suit
made
specific
reference.
and
there
is
no
reference
in
the
1948
judgment
to
any
claim
of
the
right
of
the
attorney
general
to
the
res
or
to
any
claim
of
power
to
vest
the
res.
mr.
george
b.
searls
there
was
a
which,
your
honor?
mr.
george
b.
searls
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
that
question
has
never
arisen
and
i
wouldn't
go
so
far
as
to
concede
that
if
we
get
dragged
off
into
some
collateral
issue
in
an
earlier
suit
in
it's
discover
--
decided
against
us,
that
might
later
be
binding.
but
my
point
is
that
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
oh,
it
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
that
would
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
i
--
i
think
that
would
be
binding.
mr.
george
b.
searls
but
--
well,
i
was
thinking
it
was
some
of
the
decisions
of
judge
crowley
and
knowlton
about
--
that
a
man
isn't
bound
by
every
allegation
that
may
be
made
in
an
earlier
suit
against
him
which
he
didn't
choose
to
contradict
for
some
reason.
so,
i
think
it's
clear
that
when
the
court
said
that
the
earlier
judgment
determined
--
the
custodian
did
not
have
the
powers
he
claimed,
what
they
were
referring
to
--
what
he
was
referring
to
was
the
powers
under
the
trust
indenture
which
the
attorney
general
claimed
that
he
had
taken
over
when
he
vested
reinicke's
right,
title
and
interest
and
which
are
of
course
entirely
different
and
distinct
from
his
powers
under
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act.
now,
the
court
also
made
a
finding
--
this
is
at
pages
155
and
166,
that
the
attorney
general
in
the
earlier
suit
had
requested
an
order
for
delivery
of
the
principle
to
him.
but
as
the
language
of
the
finding
shows,
what
the
court
is
saying
is
that
the
attorney
general
had
requested
an
order
for
the
delivery
of
the
principle
on
the
ground
all
the
interest
in
the
trust
had
vested
in
him
by
the
vesting
order,
not
on
the
ground
that
he
had
attempted
to
vest
the
res
itself.
in
our
reply
brief,
we
have
set
out
some
of
the
material
which
we
think
bears
on
that
finding.
mr.
george
b.
searls
yes,
your
honor.
and
the
amendment
begins
at
page
53.
now,
i'd
like
to
at
this
time
correct
with
permission
of
court,
one
error
in
our
replay
brief
in
the
bottom
--
at
the
bottom
of
page
3.
in
the
last
line,
the
word
true
should
be
trust.
the
sentence
is
--
what
that
brief
discloses
is
that
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
attorney
general
stated
that
under
the
act,
he
could
have
vested
the
res
but
that
he
had
not
done
so.
as
we
read
the
record,
there
is
nothing
in
it
at
all
to
show
there
was
any
attempt
to
assert
or
set
up
in
the
prior
suit,
the
attorney
general's
right
to
res
vest.
so
that
that
right
was
not
determined
against
him
by
any
court.
mr.
george
b.
searls
where
is
that
in
the
--
on
page
3,
your
honor?
mr.
george
b.
searls
that's
the
--
that's
the
court
--
finding
of
the
court
that
i'm
discussing.
mr.
george
b.
searls
no,
your
honor.
it's
--
i
think
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
well,
by
--
it
seems
to
be
--
it
is
on
the
ground,
if
the
trust
had
vested
in
that
--
all
interest
in
the
trust
had
vested
in
the
attorney
general.
there
might
be
a
case
in
which
there
was
a
trust
and
we
vested
all
the
interest.
and
in
that
case,
we
would
be
entitled
to
the
principle
and
perhaps
on
some
kind
of
theory
of
merger.
but
we
would
have
to
go
in
to
court
and
prove
what
those
interests
were
and
prove
that
there
was
a
merger.
we
couldn't
go
into
court
just
on
the
basis
of
our
order
and
say,
‚Äúgive
us
possession.‚Äù
so,
it
seems
to
us
that
there
is
no
--
what
has
been
called
collateral
estoppel
by
judgment
that
binds
us
here.
i
want
to
treat
now
briefly
of
the
matter
of
schaefer's
claim.
the
respondents
argue
and
the
court
seems
to
have
found
that
schaefer's
claim
of
a
contigent
interest
in
some
way
bars
the
attorney
general
from
being
entitled
to
possession.
mr.
george
b.
searls
now,
i
referred
to
the
zittman
cases,
to
earlier
cases
along
the
same
line.
all
those
seem
to
say
that
where
there
is
an
assertion
of
the
power
to
vest
the
res
that
the
existence
of
a
claim,
even
of
a
claim
of
a
present
interest
to
a
property,
is
no
defense.
that
that
has
to
be
postponed
to
subsequent
litigation
under
9
(a).
and
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
see
why
a
contigent
claim
should
stand
any
better.
the
reason
of
course
is
that
section
7
(c)
of
the
act
says
that
the
sole
relief
and
remedy
of
any
claimant
shall
be
there
provided
by
this
act.
and
that
means
a
suit
in
equity
under
section
9
(a)
after
the
property
has
been
turned
over.
the
respondents
argue
however
that
a
contigent
remainderman's
case
is
different
that
he
doesn't
have
any
effectual
remedy
under
section
9
(a).
they
say
that
is
so
for
two
reasons
that
the
trustee
may
not
maintain
a
suit
under
9
(a)
or
at
least
may
not
recover
because
he
has
no
beneficial
interest.
and
that
the
remainderman,
the
contigent
remainderman,
may
not
sue
or
at
least
recover
under
9
(a)
because
of
--
and
his
contigent
interest
can't
be
adjudicated
or
as
one
of
the
briefs
puts
it,
he
doesn't
have
ownership
at
the
time
of
vesting.
the
language
of
section
9
(a)
however,
is
about
as
broad
as
it
could
be.
and
we
think
it
provides
for
the
assertion
of
even
a
claim
like
schaefer's.
as
i
said
in
response
to,
i
think
it
was
mr.
justice
douglas,
i
don't
--
not
in
the
position
to
--
say
now
whether
he
has
a
valid
claim
under
9
(a)
or
not
because
the
--
the
cases
indicate
that
as
--
he
may
or
he
may
not
have.
but
at
any
rate,
what
section
9
(a)
says
is,
‚Äúany
person
claiming
any
interest,
right
or
title.‚Äù
mr.
george
b.
searls
oh,
no.
he
could
sue,
all
right.
i'm
just
saying
that
i
won't
try
to
predict
what
the
result
of
the
suit
would
be.
mr.
george
b.
searls
yes,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
there's
anything
to
indicate
that
he
is
an
enemy
and
therefore,
he
would
have
status
to
bring
the
suit.
now,
the
words
of
9
(a),
‚Äúany
interest,
right
or
title,‚Äù
seemed
to
us
to
be
about
as
broad
as
they
could
be.
and
they
seem
to
us
to
encompass
any
interest
--
anything
which
is
properly
termed
a
property
right.
this
court
had
said
the
section
9
(a)
being
remedial
as
to
be
broadly
construed.
it
has
also
said
in
several
occasions
that
section
9
(a)
meets
all
constitutional
requirements.
we
read
those
decisions
to
mean
that
if
you
have
a
property
interest
that
is
within
the
protection
of
the
constitution
on
the
deprivation
of
property
without
due
process
of
law
or
without
just
compensation.
that
if
you
have
such
an
interest
no
matter
what
it
is,
present
or
contingent,
you
can
set
it
up
in
a
suit
under
section
9
(a).
now,
when
i
was
indicating
a
little
while
ago
some
doubt
as
to
schaefer's
claim,
what
i
had
in
mind
was
that
in
the
analogous
field
of
a
taking
by
way
of
eminent
domain,
the
cases
have
indicated
that
some
reminders
may
be
too
remote,
too
contingent
to
be
entitled
to
compensation.
we've
cited
some
of
the
cases
on
page
27
of
our
brief.
it
seems
to
turn
upon
the
question
of
remoteness.
i'm
just
--
does
the
remainder
have
any
real
chance
of
ever
amounting
banking.
what
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
i
--
you
mean
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
--
interest,
right
or
title?
mr.
george
b.
searls
i
suppose
that
would
have
to
be
determined
in
terms
of
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
--
under
the
federal
law,
thus
the
federal
statute.
mr.
george
b.
searls
you
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
well,
i
think
you'd
look
perhaps
to
state
law
to
see
what
rights
that
gives
him
and
then
decide
whether
those
rights
fit
within
the
federal
statute.
mr.
george
b.
searls
i
think
that
is
so,
your
honor,
although
there
is
a
--
i've
read
or
seen
recently
a
reference
to
a
decision
of
the
second
circuit,
in
which
they
said
there
might
be
a
remainder
that
was
too
remote
to
be
compensable.
but
my
point
is
of
course
here
that
that
question
has
to
be
determined
under
section
9
(a).
it
is
not
a
question
for
a
decision
here.
now,
the
cases,
there
haven't
been
many
under
the
act
involving
future
interest.
one
of
them,
about
the
only
case,
9
(a)
case
involving
future
interests,
the
coler
case
which
several
of
the
respondents
cite,
decided
by
the
ninth
circuit.
in
that
case,
the
decision
went
against
the
remainderman
on
the
ground
that
his
interest
was
remote
and
was
only
on
expectancy.
however,
the
court
also
said
that
the
trustee
could
sue
under
section
9
(a)
to
determine
the
validity
and
scope
of
existing
claims
and
interests
in
the
vested
property.
and
the
ninth
circuit
had
indicated
a
similar
view
earlier
in
the
eisenberg
case
which
is
decided
in
the
bank's
brief.
mr.
george
b.
searls
the
coler
case,
i
think,
came
from
oregon,
you
honor.
mr.
george
b.
searls
that's
true.
i
couldn't
say,
your
honor,
because
the--
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
gave
one
citation
and
i
think
it
was
to
--
an
oregon
case.
for
the
proposition
that
remote
remainders
are
not
favored
in
the
law,
something
like
--
but
our
point
is
that
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
that's
true
or
if
the
trust
here
provides
as
to
be
construed
by
illinois
laws,
the
new
york
trustee
if
illinois
law
and
the
new
york
law
were
different.
mr.
george
b.
searls
but
it's
our
point
that
certainly,
a
contingent
remainder
which
has
been
known
to
the
law
for
a
long
time,
would
a
least
on
the
face
of
it,
come
within
the
terms
interest,
right
or
title.
and
that
it
is
plain
under
the
decisions
that
the
only
place
where
that
can
be
asserted
is
under
section
9
(a).
now,
i
want
to
speak
very
briefly,
one
other
point
that
the
respondents
urge.
they
say
that
the
1953
amendment
was
not
a
constitutional
exercise
of
power
under
the
act
because
it
was
issued
after
the
termination
of
the
war.
however,
the
joint
resolution
of
october
119,
1951
which
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
you
mean
the
respondent's
position,
your
honor?
mr.
george
b.
searls
they
say
that
the
amendment
--
the
order
of
1953,
the
1953
vesting,
was
not
a
constitutional
exercise
of
power
under
the
statute,
of
authority
under
the
statute,
because
it
was
issued
after
the
end
of
the
war,
which
was
october
19,
1951.
however,
the
joint
resolution
which
we've
set
up
in
our
brief
at
page
33
of
that
date,
which
terminated
the
state
of
war,
provided
that
any
property
which
prior
to
january
1,
1947
was
subject
to
vesting.
that
is,
which
could
have
been
vested
prior
the
january
1,
1947
and
had
not
been,
and
i
say
that
because
the
resolution
also
refers
expressly
to
property
already
vested,
that
any
search
property
should
continue
to
be
subject
to
the
act.
mr.
george
b.
searls
that's
on
page
33,
your
honor,
of
our
brief.
it's
the
proviso
which
begins
just
a
little
above
the
middle
of
the
page,
provided
however
that
not
withstanding
this
resolution.
now,
it's
true,
the
amendment
was
issued
in
1953,
about
a
year
and
half
after
the
joint
resolution,
but
it
was
authorized
by
the
joint
resolution.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
congress,
while
it
was
exercising
the
war
power,
while
it
--
unquestionably
had
the
war
power
and
it
was
exercising
it
in
the
joint
resolution,
could
act
with
respect
to
existing
property,
property
which
was
in
existence
before
the
january
1,
1947
and
with
respect,
and
with
property,
respective
property
which
could
be
identified.
i
believe
the
congress,
in
the
exercise
of
the
war
power,
could
have
issued
a
statute
vesting
in
some
agency
of
the
united
states,
any
time
before
the
termination
of
the
war,
all
enemy
property
or
such
part
of
enemy
property
by
description
as
it
chose.
now
in
this
case,
congress
acted
before
the
end
of
the
war,
that
is
--
or
simultaneously
to
the
end
of
the
war
with
respect
to
existing
property.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
that
was
within
its
authority.
mr.
george
b.
searls
i
don't
recall,
your
honor.
there
was
a
so-called
contractual
arrangement
that
came
into
effect
but
i
think
that
was
in
1954,
i
am
not
positive.
that
was,
i
think,
preceded
the
recognition
of
the
present
government
of
germany.
mr.
george
b.
searls
that
is
the
first
thing
i'm
going
to
take
up,
your
honor.
mr.
george
b.
searls
there
is
a
two-year
limitation
period,
but
mr.
o'leary
did
not
read
the
complete
text.
the
clause
ends
but
in
computing
such
two
years,
this
is
section
33
of
the
act.
there
shall
be
excluded
any
period
during
which
there
was
pending
a
suit
or
claim
for
return
pursuant
to
section
9
or
32
(a)
hereof.
that
is,
if
a
claim
is
filed,
the
two-year
period
is
told
or
extended.
and
it
does
not
expire
--
cannot
expire
until
after
that
claim
has
been
disposed
of.
mr.
george
b.
searls
well,
i
--
as
i
said
yesterday,
your
honor,
i
think
--
and
your
honor,
maybe
the
man
has
a
right
to
file
a
suit.
and
in
this
case,
claims
have
been
filed
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
no,
i'm
not.
and
i
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
no,
all
i
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
i'm
not
sure
about
his
right
to
recover,
your
honor.
i
am
sure
about
his
right
to
sue
if
he
is
not
an
enemy.
mr.
george
b.
searls
well,
i
think
as
i
said
yesterday,
your
honor
that
if
i
can
--
if
this
contingent
remainder
is
a
constitutionally
protected
property
interest
that
that
right
will
be
recognized
under
section
9
(a).
mr.
george
b.
searls
well,
it's
--
they've
been
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
well,
i
think
he'd
have
the
same
rights.
he
wanted
the
property
to
be
taken
by
an
imminent
domain.
i
mean,
if
he's
protected
in
the
one
case,
he's
protected
now.
now,
let's
go
back
to
section
33
for
a
moment.
in
this
case,
claims
have
been
filed
and
are
pending
with
the
office
of
alien
property
by
three
remainder
men,
bruno
kyle
reinicke,
robert
hans
reinicke
and
hans
dietrich
schaefer,
and
those
claims
were
all
filed
within
two
years
to
the
day
of
the
1953
vesting.
so
that
as
far
as
timely
filing
of
claims
are
concerned,
it
appears
that
they
have
protected
their
rights.
i'd
like
to
speak
briefly
of
a
matter
that
was
mentioned
yesterday
several
times,
the
agreements
that
have
been
made
with
germany.
i'm
not
going
--
go
into
it
extensively,
but
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
senate
document
number
11,
84th
congress
1st
session,
which
sets
out
the
most
of
the
agreements.
there
was
an
agreement
in
1952
as
mentioned
by
mr.
lourie,
which
was
ratified
by
the
senate,
but
never
became
effective
because
it
was
not
ratified
by
all
the
parties
to
it.
however,
that
agreement
did
become
effective
in
1954
by
virtue
of
another
agreement
made
in
that
year
with
certain
amendments.
mr.
ryan
suggested
yesterday
that
the
result
of
turning
a
property
over
would
be
that
it
would
be
sold.
the
trust
fund
would
be
--
become
merely
a
figure
on
the
books
of
the
treasury.
that
is
not
so
if
a
section
9
(a)
suit
is
brought.
if
a
section
9
(a)
suit
is
brought,
we
are
required
by
the
statute
to
retain
the
property
in
kind
and
unchanged.
so,
there's
the
property
returned
over.
the
dividends
would
continue
to
be
collected
on
the
stocks,
the
interest
on
the
box.
and
if
there
were
a
return
to
any
claimant,
he
got
the
interest
and
the
dividend
as
well
as
whatever
share
of
principle
he's
entitled
to.
mr.
george
b.
searls
we
keep
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
not
that
your
honor,
because
they're
not
being
paid
anything
now
if
this
--
the
income
is
being
accumulated
by
the
bank.
what
i
meant
was
that
if
he
had
shares
and
say,
american
or
u.s.
still
and
no
shares
pay
dividends,
those
shares
would
be
retained
intact,
and
the
dividends
would
be
collected
that
took
fund
would
not
be
sold
and
dissipated
if
9
(a)
suit
is
brought.
mr.
george
b.
searls
well,
if
they
were
alien
enemies
at
the
time
of
the
vesting.
mr.
george
b.
searls
i
--
but
that's
--
it
brings
up
the
question
of
the
joint
resolution.
mr.
george
b.
searls
yes.
they
--
i
think
that
congress
intended
that
they
should
continue
to
be
enemies
to
that
extent.
that's
the
language
of
the
joint
resolution.
it's
pretty
clear.
mr.
george
b.
searls
what?
mr.
george
b.
searls
well,
the
only
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
no,
because
this
--
mr.
lourie
said
in
1953,
after
this,
the
president,
who
of
course
has
the
power,
declared
there
would
be
no
more
vestings.
the
vesting
program
is
over.
mr.
george
b.
searls
no,
it
was
longer
than
that.
the
resolution
of
course
was
in
1951.
mr.
george
b.
searls
and
the
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
get
that.
mr.
george
b.
searls
no
your
honor,
it's
a
longer
period
than
that.
i
don't
know
exactly
how
long,
but
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
eleven
days,
your
honor,
i
think.
now
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
--
there's
--
there's
some
question
raised
yesterday.
mr.
george
b.
searls
that's
correct.
mr.
george
b.
searls
we
have
what
is
called
a
custody
section
that
handles
and
operates
something
like
across
the
department
of
a
bank.
mr.
george
b.
searls
of
the
trustee
or
of
our
office,
your
honor?
mr.
george
b.
searls
no,
we
have
to
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
--
we
have
to
hold
the
property
--
if
a
9
(a)
suit
is
brought,
we
have
to
hold
the
identical
property
which
we
take
over.
mr.
george
b.
searls
yes.
mr.
george
b.
searls
we
can
only
reinvest
through
the
consent
of
the
claimants.
mr.
george
b.
searls
no,
i
said,
while
the
suit
is
pending.
mr.
george
b.
searls
yes,
your
honor.
we
have
to
hold
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
--
hold
the
property
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
the
way
it
usually
worked
is
that
we
--
when
this
--
if
a
large
bond
that
she
was
paid
off
for
example,
we
get
together
with
counsel
for
the
claimant
and
agree
on
what
shall
be
done
with
it.
mr.
george
b.
searls
if
the
--
if
they
want.
mr.
george
b.
searls
we
do
not
have
--
we
do
not
have
if
a
court
action
is
pending
the
same
freedom
of
action
of
trustee
there.
mr.
george
b.
searls
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
george
b.
searls
as
a
matter
of
law.
now,
i'd
like
to
come
back
just
to
one
more
thing.
mr.
george
b.
searls
well,
i
only
think
your
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
we
think,
your
honor,
it
was
to
enable
the
government
to
carry
out
the
commitments
that
have
made
to
war
claimants.
we've
mentioned
that
under
the
war
claims
act
of
1948.
that
is
mentioned
in
our
brief.
i
don't
have
the
page
of
that.
mr.
george
b.
searls
that's
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
now,
on
the
matter
of
national
interest,
i'd
call
your
attention
of
the
fact
that
in
the
amended
vesting
order,
i
think
it's
on
page
55
of
the
record.
there
is
a
finding
that
dimming
it
necessary
in
the
national
interest,
this
vesting
is
made,
and
we
think
that
was
a
decision
within
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general.
now,
as
to
our
rights
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
i
think,
your
honor,
it's
primarily
at
that
time,
what
mr.
justice
reed
referred
to
in
that
that
we
have
been
forced
to
an
extremely
expensive
war.
and
that
it
was
the
opinion
of
congress
that
the
enemy
assets
within
our
reach
should
be
converted
to
that
purpose.
i
think
that
that
was
what
congress
thought
was
the
national
interest
and
i
think
that
that
is
what
the
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
yes
your
honor.
as
far
--
of
course,
it
won't
come
anywhere
nearer,
but
we
do
the
best
we
can.
mr.
george
b.
searls
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
united
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
well,
in
the
war
claims
act
of
1948,
that
was
addressed
primarily
to
the
claims
of
american
prisoners
of
war
who
had
been
mistreated,
to
the
claims
of
civilian
internees
who
had
been
interned
by
the
enemy
during
the
war.
and
there
was
also,
i
believe,
a
provision
in
that
act
that
congress
might
later
add
other
claim
of
other
types
of
claims
to
that
list.
mr.
george
b.
searls
well,
property
of
germans
and
japanese.
mr.
george
b.
searls
i'm
not
sure
about
--
well,
i
imagine,
undoubtedly
good
men
do
but
i'm
not
able
to
give
you
any
detail
on
that.
mr.
george
b.
searls
that
is
paid
out
of
the
vested
property.
there's
--
there's
always
been
enough
property
to
which
no
claims
are
made,
no
claims
for
return
so
the
financing
of
the
office
has
not
imposed
any
laws
on
people
who
are
entitled
to
get
it
back.
mr.
george
b.
searls
starting,
i
think
in
1923,
there
were
serious
of
amendments
to
the
act
providing
for
returns
of
property
to
various
types
of
claimants.
at
last,
by
the
war
claims
act
in
--
of
1928,
there
was
a
provision
for
the
return
to
germans
of
80%
of
their
property.
the
other
20%
to
be
withheld
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
--
to
secure
the
united
states
against
the
default
in
the
reparations
payment
germany
had
agreed
to
make.
there
was
a
default,
and
by
the
harrison
resolution
in
1934,
further
payments
to
germans
were
stopped.
however,
by
that
time,
the
80%
had
been
returned,
so
the
germans
got
80%
of
their
property
back.
mr.
george
b.
searls
i
haven't
got
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
--
the
figures
your
honor.
the
amount
left
on
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
--
left
on
hand
is
not
large.
they
were
small
in
comparison,
because
it
will
only
be
20%
of
the
property
that
we
would
have
been
entitled
to
retain
as
being
enemy
property.
it
wouldn't
have
been
20%
of
all
the
property
we
see.
mr.
george
b.
searls
well,
your
honor,
there
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
there
was
a
legislation,
there
have
been
legislation
on
several
recent
session
of
congress
but
none
of
it
has
passed.
there
was
a
proposal
at
the
last
session
by
the
administration
of
what
was
called
a
$10,000
bill
that
each
claimant
would
be
returned
up
to
$10,000.
but
there's
also
section
32
in
the
act,
which
provides
for
the
return
of
property
to
people
who
may
not
recover
under
section
9
(a)
because
they
are
enemies.
and
that
includes
the
german
views
who
were
persecuted
because
of
their
race
or
religion.
there
have
been
very
substantial
returns
under
that
section,
although,
i
have
no
figures.
mr.
george
b.
searls
no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
--
i
always
have
trouble
with
the
word
confiscation,
because
the
last
word
is
with
congress.
and
section
12,
which
i
think
is
still
effective,
it
says
that
‚Äúafter
the
war"
and
i
take
it
that
refers
to
probably
any
war.
‚Äúthe
property
shall
be
disposed
of
as
congress
shall
direct.‚Äù
so
that
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
--
until
congress
says,
‚Äúconfiscate,‚Äù
there
isn't
a
confiscation.
mr.
george
b.
searls
i
have
no
doubt,
your
honor,
there
other
--
there
are
no
--
i
don't
know
about
litigate
cases,
but
i
have
no
doubt
there
are
other
claims
pending
similar
to
this.
i
mean,
where
we
have
taken
property
subject
to
future
interest.
there
haven't
been
many
actually
litigated
cases.
i
think
i
can
recall
a
hand
about
three
of
these,
the
cohort
case,
which
i
mentioned
yesterday.
and
there
was
a
case
of
united
states
trust
company
against
hicks,
which
is
cited
by
one
of
the
respondents,
i
forget
which
one.
in
16
fd.2d
in
which
a
remainder
interest
was
returned.
i
don't
know
whether
it
was
vested
or
contingent
--
to
--
the
respondent
says
to
ancillary
administrator,
‚Äúi
don't.‚Äù
now,
those
are,
i
think,
the
only
9
(a)
suits
that
i
can
recall
that
have
been
involved
future
interest.
mr.
george
b.
searls
well,
there
was
an
agreement
with
germany,
your
honor.
i'm
not
sure
of
which
one
in
which
the
german
government
agreed
to
compensate
its
nationals
for
a
property,
which
was
retained
by
this
country.
mr.
george
b.
searls
that's
--
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
think
it's
probably
referred
to
in
that
document
i
mentioned.
mr.
george
b.
searls
to
that
extent.
mr.
george
b.
searls
to
that
extent,
your
honor.
mr.
george
b.
searls
your
honor,
i
--
that
brings
up
the
matter
which
i
was
about
to
start
on
when
some
other
question
diverted
me.
i
do
not
think
we
would
have
any
rights.
all
that
the
new
york
courts
have
given
us
is
a
right
to
a
60-day
notice.
we
can
just
stand
there
and
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
i
assume
the
justice
who
entered
that
order
thought
he
was
giving
us
some
protection.
but
since
he
found
--
then
find
that
we
had
any
rights.
and
since
he
didn't
reserved
jurisdiction
or
take
--
make
any
provision
for
what
we
might
do
in
the
future,
and
since
we've
already
got
two
judgments
against
us,
i
think
that
our
prospects
of
being
able
to
enforce
anything
in
the
event
the
trust
termination
then
gave
us
60-day
notice
would
be
less
than
slim.
mr.
george
b.
searls
well,
because
your
honor,
by
the
vesting
the
last
amendment,
i
think
we
have
exercised
the
broadest
power
we
have.
and
if
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
well,
of
course,
there
are
all
sorts
of
arguments
here.
i
don't
know,
but
at
present,
my
feeling
is
very
distinctive.
if
we
don't
prevail
here,
the
matter
might
as
well
be
written
of.
