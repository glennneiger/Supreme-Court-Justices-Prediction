i'm
talking
about
an

if
there's
an
issue
crucial
to
the

in
first
case,
an
issue
of
fact.
justice

well,
you
mean
to
please
--
you
mean
by
saying
you
do
not
say
definitely
that
he
has
a
claim,
valid
claim
of
it.
do
you
mean
that
you

on

what
report
is

would
that
apply
to
a

before
you
leave
that,
may
i
ask
you?
i
have
uncertainly,
generally
speaking,
the
purpose
of
the
seizure
to
enemy
property
in
the
time
of
war
was
that
the
enemy
should
not
have
attended
to
that
property
in
a
war
with
us.
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
government
seizing
after
peace
have
been
officially
declared?
would
that
regard
the
reservation
industry?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
purpose?
justice
hugo

if
not
the
page,
namely,
the
united
states
would
pay
the
--
pay
the
individuals.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
treaty
with
germany
provides
in
anyway
or
touch
on
any
ways
this
subject
of
what
is
beyond
this
kind
to
authorize
this
government
to
utilize
its
institution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
--
since
the
war?
