mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
if
the
court
please.
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
i
represent
the
trustee.
and
i
would
like
to
get
it
clear
as
to
what
that
trust
agreement
provided.
the
trust
agreement
provided
under
illinois
law
that
the
income
should
be
accumulated
for
the
lifetime
of
bruno
reinicke
and
the
lifetime
of
his
wife.
and
that
during
that
period,
it
might
be
used
for
the
benefit
of
their
children.
so
that
when
you
say
or
when
the
alien
--
office
of
alien
property
says
that
this
trust
was
owned
by
germans
or
held
for
germans,
it
is
not
true
because
the
owners
of
that
property
cannot
be
ascertained
until
the
termination
of
the
trust
upon
the
death
of
the
survivor,
of
mr.
and
mrs.
reinicke.
so
that
we
claim
that
when
the
office
of
alien
property
made
the
new
vesting
order
and
found
that
the
property
was
held
for
germany,
it
was
deciding
something,
it
was
contrary
to
fact.
it
was
deciding
something
that
had
already
being
determined
in
the
previous
action
where
the
court
had
said,
“at
present,
we
cannot
determine
who
owns,
who
will
own
this
property.
we
must
wait
until
the
termination
of
the
trust
until
we
do
that.”
so
that
when
counsel
for
the
attorney
general
says,
“this
property
was
held
by
germans,”
he's
not
--
he's
speaking
loosely.
he's
not
at
hearing
to
the
terms
of
the
trust
agreement,
nor
is
he
adhering
to
the
determination
that
was
made
by
the
supreme
court
of
new
york
in
the
previous
action.
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
well,
the
supreme
court
has
jurisdiction
of
this
trust.
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
it
took
jurisdiction
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
1930s
and
made
certain
determinations
and
it
continued
its
jurisdiction
in
the
other
suit
that
was
brought
in
the
1940s
for
instructions
and
which
has
just
been
mentioned
by
counsel
for
the
attorney
general.
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
that
is
so,
and
over
the
trustees.
all
of
the
property
was
in
new
york.
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
the
court
did
not.
the
court
in
that
--
at
that
time
said
the
beneficiary
--
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
the
--
well,
the
beneficiaries
cannot
be
determined
at
this
time.
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
the
ultimate
takers
because
the
present
beneficiaries
could
not
be
determined.
it
was
a
trust
to
accumulate.
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
no
one
would
receive
the
income
unless
bruno
reinicke
directed
it
and
he
had
no
power
to
direct
anymore.
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
yes,
sir.
and
it
was
that
power
to
direct
--
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
--
the
disposition
of
the
income
that
the
attorney
general
wanted
and
which
he
sought
in
the
previous
action.
and
the
court
in
that
action
determined
that
it
was
not
the
kind
of
power
that
could
pass
to
the
attorney
general
as
successor
to
the
alien
property
custodian.
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
well
he
claims
that
in
the
second
action
or
rather
in
the
second
vesting
order,
he
invested
the
res,
the
securities.
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
well,
they
don't
say
legal
type,
no.
they
just,
in
the
order,
they
refer
to
the
property.
now,
if
the
trustee
had
a
legal
type
into
that
trust
fund
and
the
trustees
in
america
--
and
here,
we
have
the
attorney
general
coming
in
and
determining
that
a
certain
trust
fund
is
held
for
germans,
although
it
may
go
to
americans
one
day
and
it's
held
all
the
time
by
an
american
trustee.
so
that,
feeling
as
we
did
that
there
was
a
determination
which
was
contrary
to
fact
and
contrary
to
law,
the
trustee
felt
that
it
must
resist
decision.
and
then
a
suit
was
--
and
of
course
at
the
same
time,
the
attorney
general
demanded
an
account.
so
a
suit
was
brought
in
the
new
york
supreme
court
for
an
accounting
and
for
instructions
as
to
what
should
be
done
with
trust
fund.
as
to
what
should
be
done
with
the
trust
fund?
the
court
has
already
heard.
the
supreme
court
of
new
york
county
determined
that
the
trust
fund
should
be
--
should
continue
in
the
hands
of
the
chase
--
chase
national
bank.
he
invested
and
reinvested
but
that
no
payment
might
be
made
to
any
alien
without
60
days
notice
to
the
alien
property
office.
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
he
had
the
authority
for
--
it
was
determined
in
the
previous
--
in
one
of
the
--
in
the
previous
action
that
he
no
longer
has
that
authority.
it's
subject
to
blocking
and
licenses
and
so
forth.
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
i
believe
that
is
so.
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
no,
it
was
determined
that
the
office
of
--
that
the
alien
property
custodian
or
the
attorney
general
as
its
successor,
had
no
right
to
exercise
that
power
on
behalf
of
mr.
reinicke.
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
yes.
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
he
was
restricted.
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
that
is
so.
he
cannot
move.
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
that's
what
it
amounts
to
in
the
facts.
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
yes,
we
think
so.
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
well,
neither
sides
--
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
neither
side
asked
the
court
to
do
that
but
if
the
court
apparently
felt
that
the
alien
--
office
of
alien
property
would
have
sufficient
protection,
if
it
got
60
days
notice
of
any
proposed
things.
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
i
think
that
that
is
what
the
court
has
in
mind.
what
the
court
had
in
mind
was
the
protection
of
the
office
of
alien
property.
that
was
the
real
--
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
we
think
so
but
we
also
think
that
the
previous
activities
and
the
previous
action
bar
--
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
--
the
alien
property
--
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
yes,
bar
him
from
taking
advantage
of
the
vesting
order
he
made
in
1933.
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
you
mean
on
page
157
section
9
of
that
decision?
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
well,
that's
one
of
the
paragraphs
we
rely
on.
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
yes.
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
right.
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
that's
--
that's
his
contention.
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
if
it
were
determined
five
years
or
six
years
ago,
the
alien
--
office
of
alien
property
was
not
entitled
to
the
income.
five
--
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
that's
what
9
says,
and
10
says
more
about
the
accumulated
income.
and
11
says
something
else
about
the
income.
it
says
that
none
of
the
income
which
may
be
collected
during
the
lifetime
of
bruno
reinicke
may
be
received
by
(inaudible).
it
covers
all
or
already
accumulated
and
the
income
to
be
collected.
well,
isn't
that
res
judicata?
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
well,
that's
what
they
say.
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
but
as
i
said
before,
we
think
that
they
are
barred
by
what
went
on
in
the
other
action
and
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
termination
of
enemy
ownership
of
the
properties
was
erroneous.
and
they
knew
better.
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
well,
that's
a
close
question.
i
think
may
be
it
is
because
if
he
can't
get
the
income,
you
can't
get
the
principle.
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
i
know
but
what
happens,
if
the
government
gets
possession
of
this
trust
fund,
it
will
become
a
sum
of
money
in
--
on
the
books
of
the
treasury
to
the
credit
of
this
trust.
that's
what
will
happen.
or
there
will
be
no
more
from
this
trust
fund.
all
the
securities
will
be
sold.
it
will
not
be
held
as
an
entity
anymore.
and
that's
one
of
the
things
about
--
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
the
government
can
sell
--
sell
immediately
and
simply
credit
this
particular
trust
with
so
many
dollars
on
the
books
of
the
treasury.
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
i
think
that
that
is
so.
it
was
clearly
--
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
we
claim
of
course
that
for
this
trust
to
be
seized
by
the
government,
would
result
an
immediate
cessation
of
any
income
and
no
one
could
bring
suit
now
to
get
that
back
because
if
the
trustee
brought
suit,
the
office
of
alien
property
would
say,
"well,
you
haven't
any
real
interest
here."
on
the
other
hand
if
young
schaefer
brought
suit,
they
would
say,
"well,
your
interest
can't
be
determined
until
the
death
of
your
grandmother
and
grandfather."
so
that
there
is
no
remedy
under
9
(a)
in
the
case
of
this
trust.
furthermore,
there
is
no
reason
for
that
matter,
why
a
trust
should
be
res
vested
as
they
say
because
the
interest
of
the
germans
and
they
vested,
they
were
already
been
vested.and
when
those
interest
fall
in,
they
can
be
taken.
my
time
is
up,
i
--
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
all
right.
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
has
been
accumulated.
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
not
being
distributed.
and
none
of
it
will
be
distributed.
mr.
thomas
a.
ryan
of
the
court
order
too.
i
was
saying
that
there
was
no
remedy
for
anyone.
let
us
take
the
case
of
young
schaefer.
let
us
assume
that
after
the
elapse
of
maybe
30-40
years
when
his
grandparents
die,
he
should
be
a
remainderman
of
the
trust.
he
will
then
make
a
claim
against
the
alien
--
office
of
the
alien
property
and
they
will
say
to
him,
"why
mr.
schaefer,
you
can't
have
any
of
this
because
only
those
persons
who
owns
something
immediately
prior
to
the
vesting,
is
entitled
to
recover
it."
that's
what
the
law
says
you
see.
so,
"well,
schaefer
won't
own
any
interest
in
this
trust
until
his
grandmother
and
grandfather
dead,
until
the
trust
terminates.
so
that
there
was
no
remedy
here
and
consequently
i
think
that
the
statute
insofar
as
its
operation
and
this
trust
is
concerned
is
unconstitutional.
