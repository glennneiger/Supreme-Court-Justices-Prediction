justice
stanley
reed
what
--
what
was
the
basis
to
the
objection
of
the
trustee
to
this
second
suit
in
1953?
justice
stanley
reed
did
they
set
up
the
fact
of
the
american
citizen
be
one
of
the
beneficiaries?
justice
stanley
reed
and
is
it
--
is
it
the
government's
position
that
because
it's
a
trust,
you
can
take
the
part
of
the
american
citizen
also
with
the
alien
property
control?
justice
stanley
reed
now,
the
trustee
was
not
a
german,
not
an
--
an
enemy.
justice
stanley
reed
was
not
an
enemy.
justice
stanley
reed
at
some
of
the
beneficiary's
word.
justice
stanley
reed
yes.(voice
overlap)
--
justice
stanley
reed
it
wasn't
or
not?
justice
stanley
reed
it
was
one
that
was
not
an
enemy.
justice
stanley
reed
i
know
but
i
understood
you
to
say
that
there
was
one
beneficiary
who
was
american
citizen.
justice
stanley
reed
i
understood
that
but
not
before
the
decision
was
made.
he
wasn't
--
wasn't
born
after
the
decision
of
new
york.
justice
stanley
reed
so,
he
was
in
the
existence
then?
justice
stanley
reed
was
there
an
amendment
after
the
birth
of
the
schaefer
child?
justice
stanley
reed
that
is
before
the
birth
of
the
child,
as
i
understand.
that
is
before
the
birth
of
the
american
--
justice
stanley
reed
is
there
a
provision
in
these
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
the
alien
property
custodian
or
has
the
american
citizen
come
in
and
claim
his
rights
in
the
fund
after
it's
been
--
justice
stanley
reed
was
vesting
order
number
4551
the
1945
or
1953
order?
justice
stanley
reed
was
the
1945
order?
justice
stanley
reed
where
--
where
is
that?
justice
stanley
reed
did
the
supreme
court
of
new
york
deal
with
the
--
with
the
beneficiary
of
the
--
the
then
beneficiary
of
the
trust?
justice
stanley
reed
yes.
justice
stanley
reed
i
suppose
it
took
jurisdiction
because
of
jurisdiction
over
the
trustee.
justice
stanley
reed
well,
my
query
was
that
in
the
court
--
in
the
first
decision
of
new
york
court
of
appeals,
determined,
who
was
the
beneficiary
of
the
trust?
justice
stanley
reed
(voice
overlap)
would
take,
who
--
justice
stanley
reed
well,
is
that
the
ultimate
taker
or
the
beneficiary
is
the
--
justice
stanley
reed
no
--
no
one
received
the
income?
justice
stanley
reed
i've
looked
on
--
on
the
certain
but
i
--
i
didn't
understand
your
statement
in
regard
to
the
--
the
right
to
the
income.
i
understood
that
mr.
brownell
began
at
the
authority
to
designate
the
taker
of
that
income.
justice
stanley
reed
so,
he
could
only
designate
it
to
--
make
a
designation
by
a
license.
justice
stanley
reed
therefore,
the
property
was
under
the
control
and
came
under
the
force
of
the
alien
property
act,
is
that
it?
justice
stanley
reed
yes,
i
understood
that.
justice
stanley
reed
but
mr.
reinicke
was
restricted
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
by
virtue
of
the
alien
property
act.
justice
stanley
reed
so,
he
--
he
did
have
a
power
that
was
derived
from
--
or
rather
that
--
that
he
had
a
power
which
was
cancelled
by
the
alien
property
act.
justice
stanley
reed
he
demanded
the
right
and
the
income.
justice
stanley
reed
what
--
why
would
that
come?
would
that
answer
the
problem?
justice
stanley
reed
that's
a
right
to
recover.
justice
stanley
reed
that
is
the
decision
in
the
lower
--
the
first
preceding,
the
one
on
page
150
of
the
record?
justice
stanley
reed
where
is
the
decision,
the
first
action
(inaudible)
justice
stanley
reed
that's
all
right.
i
didn't
have
on
my
record
either.
justice
stanley
reed
to
reinvest,
per
se.
justice
stanley
reed
to
pay
for
the
war,
you
mean?
justice
stanley
reed
what
is
--
what
are
those
claims?
justice
stanley
reed
what
about
germany?
a
lot
of
citizens
have
lost
property
in
germany,
a
lot
of
confiscation
there.
justice
stanley
reed
well,
american
citizens
lost
their
property
by
the
actions
of
the
germans
and
the
japanese.
justice
stanley
reed
then
there's
the
overhead
of
the
alien
property
custodian
itself.
