mr.
samuel
anatole
lourie
yes,
sir,
mr.
chief
justice
--
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
the
guardian
ad
litem
of
this
little
american
infant,
schaefer.
and
i
must
state
that
already
it
has
been
demonstrated
here
that
he
must
object
and
defend
his
interest
in
this
suit
because
the
relegation
to
any
other
suit
under
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
will
not
furnish
him
adequate
remedy.
and
i
--
if
i
may
put
it
bluntly
the
relegation,
cavalier
fashion
relegation
to
a
suit
under
9
(a)
is
only
called
comfort
form
as
for
schaefer
because
if
he
comes
into
court
under
a
section
9
(a)
proceeding
or
after
having
exhausted
the
administrative
remedies
which
are
required
and
we
did
sought
of
merely
out
of
caution.
i
filed
the
claim
although
i
thought
it
was
superfluous.
i
now
--
i'm
for
sure
can
recon
with
an
objection
on
behalf
of
the
office
of
alien
property
that
he
does
not
have
ownership
of
proposed
proprietary
rights
at
the
present.
and
if
--
i
don't
need
even
to
speculate
on
that
whether
they
will
or
they
will
not
refrain
or
furnish
this
defense
or
objection.
they
already
state
in
their
brief,
i
mean
the
attorney
general's
brief,
states
on
page
27.
"on
the
record,
schaefer's
interest
is
contingent
not
vested
and
he
has
no
present
possessory
interest
to
assert."
in
other
words,
they
--
infant
schaefer
has
no
adequate
remedy
and
i
venture
to
submit
respectfully
that
that
alone
makes
this
amendment
as
a
vesting
order
unconstitutional
and
unlawful.
now,
i
would
not
like
to
--
mr.
samuel
anatole
lourie
i
--
under
new
york
and
illinois
law,
i
do
content
and
that
is
reflected
in
the
decision
and
opinion
of
new
york
courts.
and
the
new
york
court
say
that
at
present,
the
ultimate
remainderman
or
beneficiaries
are
not
ascertainable.
there
were
only
--
they
would
be
ascertainable
only
upon
occurrence
of
certain
events.
these
events
will
occur
sometimes
in
the
future.
at
present,
it
can
not
be
ascertained
who
has
the
ownership
and
control.
we
know
only
that
much
that
the
legal
title
is
in
the
new
york
bank,
the
chase
national
or
the
chase
manhattan
bank.
it's
an
american
bank
and
there
is
no
any
alien
interest
under
any
definition
under
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act.
that
is
clear
and
nothing
is
going
to
happen
to
the
trust
and
i
want
to
preface
my
further
remarks
because
i
like
to
address
myself
principle
to
the
question
of
constitutionality
or
vesting
up
to
termination
of
war.
which
i
think
is
the
ultimate
and
paramount
question
in
connection
with
this
present
case
before
this
honorable
court.
the
interest,
national
interest
of
the
united
states
are
fully
protected
by
the
right,
title
and
interest
vesting
order.
assuming
arguendo
for
the
--
for
the
sake
of
this
present,
my
argument,
that
the
right,
title
and
interest
vesting
order
covered
or
all
interest
--
all
enemy
interest
in
this
case.
then
it
follows
that
nothing
can
happen
to
the
trust
until
this
right,
title
and
vesting
order
has
been
cancelled
the
notes
or
the
beneficiaries
whose
right,
title
and
interest
was
vested,
have
come
in
under
section
9
(a)
and
have
adjudicated
the
rights,
title
and
interest
or
the
right
to
reclaim
the
property
as
american
citizens.
in
addition
thereto,
this
trust
is
subject
to
executive
order
8389
as
amended.
in
other
words,
everything
is
frozen
and
no
penny
can
be
paid
out
without
any
license.
now,
this
provision
which
was
put
in
by
mr.
justice
(inaudible)
adds
an
additional
safety
for
the
attorney
general
and
for
the
national
interest,
if
you
would
--
if
you
please.
it
says
that
prior
to
any
happening
when
there
is
an
intention
or
a
distribution
and
there
is
no
other
protection
available
for
the
united
states'
interest,
the
attorney
general
got
60
days
notice,
and
within
the
60
days
notice,
the
attorney
general
has
plenty
of
remedies
available.
it
can
go
to
the
court
by
injunction,
enjoin
payment
or
something
like
that,
and
this
is
the
60
days.
now,
the
national
interest
being
protected,
what
is
behind
this
all
res
vesting
order?
and
i
like
to
paint
a
little
bit
about
the
background
to
the
honorable
court.
well,
we
all
know
that
war,
the
hostilities
ceased
in
1945.
in
1948,
this
litigates
--
the
first
round
of
this
litigation
took
place.
and
the
court
said
that
that
is
a
continuing
trust.
it
will
remain
in
the
hands
of
the
american
trustee,
chase
bank,
and
it
will
be
administered
and
nobody
can
get
anything.
then
it
went
to
the
appellate
division
and
court
of
appeals.
five
years
later,
only
five
years
after
the
first
adjudication.
meaning
in
1953,
n
april
6,
1953,
the
attorney
general
or
rather
should
i
put
it
a
subdivision,
an
agency,
office
of
alien
property
decided
that
now
is
the
time
to
vest
the
res.
now,
whether
that
is
a
coincidence
or
not,
i
only
like
to
relate
to
this
honorable
court
to
the
facts.
on
that
time,
that
on
or
about
middle
of
april,
chancellor
adner
was
supposed
or
--
and
did
in
fact
visit
the
united
states.
and
it
was
rumored
all
around
that
one
of
the
things
that
will
be
accomplished
in
connection
with
the
visit
that
the
united
states
government
will
determine
and
decide
to
terminate
vesting
of
german
property.
and
indeed,
this
was
proclaimed
by
the
president,
april
17,
1953.
that
means,
on
the
eve
of
this
event
where
the
president
proclaimed
an
end
to
vesting
of
german
property,
the
office
of
alien
property
decided
on
the
eleventh
hour
of
five
minutes
to
12,
decided
to
res
vest.
now,
i
like
to
ask
a
rhetoric
question.
where
is
the
war
urgency
for
such
a
measure?
we
know
all
what
the
purpose
of
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
is.
it
like
--
it
is
for
the
purpose
of
depriving
the
enemy
of
resources
and
means
to
conduct
a
successful
war
and
to
augment
our
resources.
in
other
words,
to
augment
our
war
potential
and
reduce
the
enemies'
war
potential.
that
is
the
primary
purpose
of
that.
now,
we
have
been
told
that
there
are
some
additional
purposes,
and
one
of
these
additional
purposes
is
as
they
said
that,
"we
have
various
obligations
under
international
treaties.
it
is
said
that
it
should
be
used
for
satisfaction
of
claim
of
american
citizens
against
germany
and
so
on."
now,
i
--
i
like
to
answer
this
very
arguments
which
are
presented
in
the
brief
of
the
attorney
general
with
my
own
argument
supported
by
an
authoritative
statement
of
the
secretary
of
state
who
refuted
completely
this
type
of
argument.
and
although
with
--
i
know
that
the
report
of
senate
committee
on
judiciary
has
no
legal
significance
before
this
honorable
court.
it
is
not
a
matter
of
law.
but
if
i
may
incorporate
it
into
my
argument
to
refute
the
argument
that
we
have
some
obligations
under
international
treaty
that
we
must
take
the
german,
enemy
property
and
keep,
retain
it,
and
properly
confiscate.
with
your
indulgence,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
just
read
one
paragraph
from
this
report.
mr.
samuel
anatole
lourie
that
is
84th
congress,
2nd
session,
senate
report
number
2089,
and
that
is
payment
of
war
damage
claims
in
return
of
vested
assets,
the
report
on
the
new
bill.
and
there
was
various
testimony.
it
is
very
eliminative
report,
but
i
would
not
take
much
time
if
you
permit
me
to
read
only
this
passage,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
has
been
an
argument
that
the
full
return
of
the
seized
assets
of
former
enemy
nationals
violates
the
provision
of
certain
international
agreements.
the
contention
is
without
any
foundation
in
fact
or
law.
secretary
of
state,
mr.
dulles,
in
testifying
before
this
subcommittee
of
the
congress
on
july
2nd,
1954,
in
reference
to
a
full
return
of
seized
assets
among
all
the
things
said.
the
policy
adopted
after
world
war
ii
of
completely
eliminating
ownership
of
enemy
private
property
was
a
departure
from
historic
american
policy
after
other
wars.
i
myself
had
--
have
had
some
experience
in
the
field.
i
worked
on
this
very
problem
at
paris,
in
connection
with
this
treaty
of
versailles
at
the
end
of
the
first
world
war.
the
secretary
of
state,
in
referring
to
the
paris
reparation
agreement
of
1946,
that's
what
is
refereed
to,
said
in
testimony
before
the
subcommittee
in
1954.
"yes,
i
am
familiar
with
that
agreement.
in
my
opinion
that
agreement,
whatever
its
intent
may
have
been
as
an
executive
agreement,
was
without
authority
whatever
to
bind
the
congress
of
the
united
states
in
this
matter.
the
property
had
been
vested
by
action
of
congress."
i
believe
congress
has
the
right
to
decide
what
to
do
about
the
matter
and
completely
refutes
these
arguments
which
are
advanced
now
for
continuation
of
vesting
after
termination
of
state
of
war.
now,
we
had,
after
world
war
i,
a
similar
situation.
thereby,
two
resolutions
a)
the
resolution
passed
in
exactly
on
july
--
first
resolution
was
in
april
and
the
--
the
second
resolution
was
on
july
2nd,
1921.
the
first
resolution
terminated
war
time
legislation
exempting
therefrom
from
this,
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act.
and
then
came
the
second
resolution
which
terminated
the
state
of
war
but
preserved
the
right
to
vest
property
which
has
been
subject
of
vesting.
and
the
cases
after
world
war
i
held
that
if
there
was
a
vesting
order
already
served.
in
other
words,
instead
of
using
the
strong
hand
as
it
is
used
in
paris
courts,
the
demand
was
then
already
served
upon
the
owner
or
possessor
of
the
property.
then,
the
property
can
be
retained
by
the
united
states.
if
the
demand
order
was
served
after
that,
no
property
can
be
retained
because
you
can
vest
only
property
during
time
of
war,
and
the
war
has
officially
terminated
by
presidential
proclamation.
in
this
case,
in
--
after
world
war
ii,
we
have
a
similar
situation
whereby
that
is
of
a
resolution,
a
joint
resolution
of
the
congress.
and
then
for
the
presidential
proclamation
of
october,
it
was
--
the
--
the
state
of
war
between
germany
and
the
--
and
the
united
states
was
terminated
but
there
was
preserved
the
right
of
united
states,
a)
to
retain
the
property
which
had
been
already
vested.
and
then
it
said,
"property
which
was
subject
to
vesting
on
january
1stm
1947."
if
i
may
respectfully
submit
this
portion
of
the
joint
resolution
which
says
that
the
united
states
can
retain
the
property
which
was
already
vested.
this
is
fully
in
accord
with
the
constitutional
war
power.
if
however,
the
order
portion
of
this
saving
clause
saying
that
you
may
still
vest
property
which
was
subject
to
vesting
prior
to
january
1st,
1947,
has
some
power.
i
maintain
that
in
this
portion
or
the
whole
resolution
to
that
extent,
is
unconstitutional
because
it
is
not
in
accord
with
the
war
power
and
it
is
not
in
accord
with
the
very
definition
in
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act.
trading
with
the
enemy
defines
the
word
end
of
--
the
words
"end
of
the
war"
as
used
herein,
shall
be
deemed
to
mean
the
date
of
proclamation
of
exchange
of
ratification
of
the
of
the
treaty
of
peace
unless
the
president
shall
for
proclamation,
declare
a
prior
date
in
which
gave
the
date
so
proclaimed,
shall
be
deemed
to
be
the
end
of
the
ward
within
the
meaning
of
this
act.
now,
the
president
has
proclaimed
the
end
of
the
war.
it
means
that
the
very
definition
of
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
in
section
2
became
operative.
and
if
it
became
operative,
that
means
you
cannot
any
longer
vest.
mr.
samuel
anatole
lourie
yes,
sir
mr.
samuel
anatole
lourie
i
--
i
believe
--
mr.
samuel
anatole
lourie
i
would,
if
i
may
express
my
view,
that
they
went
on
both
because
there
are
four
or
five
cause
--
mr.
samuel
anatole
lourie
yes.
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
there
is
a
statement
to
that
effect.
i
would
not
like
to
push
my
fingers
but
they
are
on
that
right.
now,
here
--
mr.
samuel
anatole
lourie
on
construction
as
were
well
--
mr.
samuel
anatole
lourie
correct.
mr.
samuel
anatole
lourie
correct.
yes,
sir.
that's
my
understanding.
if
i
--
mr.
samuel
anatole
lourie
correct,
yes.
mr.
samuel
anatole
lourie
i
respectfully
submit
that
it
may
be
but
as
there
may
be
difficulties.
and
i
admit
frankly
that
there
may
be
difficulties
in
doing
so
because
--
and
if
i
may
point
out
why
i
say
difficulty
frankly
because
the
resolution
of
--
after
world
war
i
speaks
of
subject
of
demand.
and
this
resolution
says
subject
to
vesting.
now,
i
might
parenthetically
add
that
there
is
no
question
about
that,
that
demand,
the
term
demand
in
world
war
i
was
the
same
as
the
term
vesting
in
world
war
ii.
whereas,
under
world
war
i
provisions,
demand
have
to
be
served
and
that
during
world
ward
ii,
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
by
rulings
was
amended
that
you
don't
--
do
not
need
to
serve
the
vesting
order.
you
can't
publish
and
it
becomes
effective
as
the
date
of
publication.
then
--
mr.
samuel
anatole
lourie
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
anatole
lourie
the
same
specification,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
was
in
the
resolution
after
world
war
i.
i
mean,
to
that
extent,
there
is
no
--
no
(inaudible)
mr.
samuel
anatole
lourie
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
anatole
lourie
yes.
mr.
samuel
anatole
lourie
correct.
mr.
samuel
anatole
lourie
correct.
mr.
samuel
anatole
lourie
in
--
in
other
words,
if
i
may
put
it
in
a
language
of
colloquialism,
one
can
blow
hot
and
cold
at
the
same
time.
one
can
--
and
one
can
say
the
germany
and
our
friends
and
our
allies
and
yet,
the
same
talk
and
take
property
which
allegedly
belongs
to
a
german.
now,
i
like
to
finish
on
a
--
on
a
more
concrete
matter
in
this
question.
there
are
many
questions.
by
the
way,
if
i
may
answer
a
question
presented
to
my
distinguished
colleague,
mr.
ryan,
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
before,
whether
germany
entered
into
any
contractual
agreements
before.
i
may
say,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
if
i
may,
belatedly
answer
this
question.
that
on
may
26,
there
was
an
--
may
26,
1952,
there
was
an
additional
contractual
agreement.
and
if
i
may
quote
the
state
department
about
them,
"the
contractual
agreement
with
the
federal
republic
of
germany
bring
to
an
end
the
occupation
of
germany
and
including
the
federal
republic
as
an
equal
partner
in
the
community
of
nations,
over
signed,
may
26,
1952."
on
august
6,
1952,
president
truman
formally
ratified
pursuant
to
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate,
the
convention
on
relations
between
the
three
powers
and
the
federal
republic
of
germany.
26
department
have
said
both
and
it's
on
page
8
of
my
brief,
if
i
may
draw
your
attention
to
that.
mr.
samuel
anatole
lourie
i
--
i
--
my
question
to
that
statement,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
is
this.
can
the
congress
--
does
the
congress
have
unbridled
use
of
war
power?
my
answer
is
no
because
its
country
--
mr.
samuel
anatole
lourie
yes,
because
--
because
this
--
mr.
samuel
anatole
lourie
correct,
sir.
and
i
--
i
think
that
in
addition
to
the
constitutional
provision,
we
have
provisions
of
international
law,
and
i
think
that
all
although
there
are
two
of
use,
the
prevailing
view
is
that
private
property
is
not
appropriated
for
war
claims
after
the
war
is
over.
and
--
mr.
samuel
anatole
lourie
one
of
them
is
the
principle
question
on
which
the
courts
of
new
york
adhered
to
its
decision
in
prior
court.
that's
res
judicata.
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
res
judicata
here.
and
if
i
may
point
out
just
in
few
--
my
time
is
over.
mr.
samuel
anatole
lourie
by
your
permission
if
i
may,
if
you
--
mr.
samuel
anatole
lourie
my
distinguished
opponent,
mr.
searls,
tries
to
point
out
that
it
cannot
be
res
adjudicata
for
the
simple
reason
that
we
have
here
a
different
cause
of
action
in
the
present
litigation
from
the
action
or
the
affirmative
relief
requested
by
the
intervening
party,
then
also
attorney
general,
in
the
prior
action.
what
is
the
cause
of
action
if
one
claims
property?
i
think
the
cause
of
action
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
prior
actions.
the
cause
of
action
of
the
ultmate
operate
fact
underlying
the
claim
or
the
action
or
the
cause
of
action.
these
facts
are
the
same.
and
if
i
may
suggest
in
order
to
avoid
any
labor,
if
you
just
oppose
the
specification
of
names
and
interest
in
the
1945
vesting
order,
with
the
specification
and
list
of
names
of
any
in
the
interest
in
the
1953,
you
will
find
that
the
exactly
the
same
names,
exactly
the
same
interest,
were
vested
then
as
here.
now,
why
was
there
a
necessity
for
amendment,
why?
i
must
add
this
that
i
am
fully
in
accord
with
the
trading
with
the
enemy
program.
i
have
written
about
it
in
publications
but
i
am
certainly
opposed
to
administrative
excesses.
and
i
think
that
the
areas
of
this
belated
last
minute
deal
to
get
the
property.
now,
i'd
like
to
--
i'll
answer
also
this
question.
what
is
going
to
happen
with
the
property
when
the
vesting
order
is
really
brought
into
effect?
the
--
the
result
is
that
that
the
trust
will
be
destroyed.
that's
result
number
one.
number
two,
the
very
expensive
expenses
of
litigations
will
be
subtracted
or
paid
out
of
the
trust.
the
trust
will
lose
its
identity
to
go
in
a
--
in
a
general
account
and
it
will
not
be
more
interest
bearing
or
anything
of
that.
and
yet,
when
we
come
to
it,
who
has
the
present
right
to
reclaim
the
property.
under
9
(a),
we
will
have
all
the
objections
which
have
been
advanced
heretofore
by
the
attorney
general
about
this
litigation.
there
is
one
more
point
i
now
--
that
i
am
imposing
upon
the
honorable
court's
patience.
there
is
one
more
thing.
the
attorney
general
in
his
brief
made
a
statement
which
i
would
ay
is
an
incorrect
statement.i
wouldn't
use
any
different
qualification
for
that.
here,
we
have
dealings
with
predominantly
prevailing,
that
is
tautology
used.
german
interest,
that's
not
so.
first
of
all,
the
ultimate
interest
cannot
be
determined,
it
can
be
the
american
infant
schaefer.
but
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
you
that
the
three
children
beneficiaries
already
--
the
two
boys,
they're
born
here.
they
became
american
citizens
by
the
--
by
the
fact
of
birth.
they
were
born
in
cook
county,
illinois.
and
when
they
were
six
and
seven
years,
their
parent
went
back
to
germany
and
there
is
where
they
remained
being
infants
before
the
world
war
ii
and
they
came
back.
and
what
i
want
to
point
out,
what
is
the
relevance
of
this.
the
irrelevance
is
this
that
at
the
time
of
the
issuance
of
the
amended
vesting
order,
all
these
three
children
were
residents
of
the
united
states.
and
the
residents,
at
the
time
of
the
vesting
order
is
the
determining
fact.
i
thank
you
very
much
for
the
