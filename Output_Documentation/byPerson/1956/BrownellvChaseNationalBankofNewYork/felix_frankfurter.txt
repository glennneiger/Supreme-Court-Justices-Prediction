by
what
law
is
that
to
be
determined?
is
that
a
--
justice
felix

--
posing
all
questions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
whether
the
contigent
remainder
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
were
involved.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
doesn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
therefore
the
determinable
property
interest
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
remember,
i
--
i
would
draw
the
(inaudible)
under
this
--
new
york
has
held
that
no
matter
remote
a
contigent
remainder
is,
you
can't
destroy
it
as
a
property
value.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
it's
--
results
of
ninth
circuit
case.
did
they
look
to
--
where
they
come
from
california?
did
they
look
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
look
to
the
oregon
law
or
did
they
--
well,
you
might
get
a
difference
then
according
to
the
state
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
another
words
if
--
if
new
york
protects
this
kind
of
an
instance,
that
would
be
too
remote
under
a
federal,
then
you
might
have
a
real
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
april
6,
1953,
had
we
changed
our
relation
toward
western
--
germany,
our
political
relation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
--
what
is
the
significance
of
the
60-day
notice
which
you
referred?
justice
felix
frankfurter
60-day
notice
--
60-day
notice
for
what,
in
relation
to
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
that
the
60-day
notice
is
with
a
view
to
assert
by
the
alien
property
custodian
indicating
of
whatever
right
he
may
have
if
he's
now
sitting
here.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
your
chief
fact
into
this
suit
is,
there's
no
need
--
what
it
asked.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
sufficiently
protected
by
the
60-day
notice?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
legal
practice,
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
thing
to
make
you
say
this
argument
that
--
paragraph
9,
is
it,
in
the
--
and
these
are
different
writers
efficient,
they
have
covered
and
told
me
this
was
not
in
relation
to
the
judgments.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
both.
the
--
the
one
you're
relying
on
in
paragraph
10,
volume
476
on
page
169,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
subjects
you
for
purpose
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understood
mr.
searls'
observation
on
that
for
us
that
what
was
determined
in
the
prior
suit
in
paragraph
9
on
page
157
--
quite
right
except
the
one
you
called
my
attention
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
the
two
are
different.
therefore,
what
was
supposed
to
be
barred
by
10,
also
barred
by
9,
is
that
right?
that's
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
want
your
thoughts
on
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
9
says.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
to
the
fact
that
he
can't
get
the
income.
what
is
--
what
is
cumbent
to
that
is
that
where
it's
eternal
vested
and
not
for
the
income,
not
where
--
the
service
vesting
and
not
the
ultimate
disposition.
is
that
right?
the
government
here
doesn't
say,
"we
are
entitled
to
this."
they
simply
say
they
want
to
get
their
hopes
into
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
does
a
determination
--
does
an
adjudication
in
--
whenever
this
were
and
earlier
in
1948,
that
the
government
is
not
entitled,
that
the
custodian
is
not
entitled
to
the
income.
is
that
the
equivalent
of
determining
that
he
can't
order
--
issue
a
vesting
order
to
hold.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
but
non
(inaudible)
that
you
can't
have
a
grip
on
it
for
future
determination
of
whatever
income
there
may
be.
the
government
(inaudible)
they
just
suggest
that
it's
government
possession.
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
as
the
possessor
--
as
the
possessor,
the
government
can
affect
the
disposition
of
the
trust,
although
not
for
its
own
purposes,
is
that
what
you
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where,
as
you
say
that
the
trust
grid
of
the
chase
bank
not
to
determine
that
and
not
the
attorney
general
or
the
government.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
that
there
were
cases
under
the
--
after
the
world
war
i.
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
those
--
did
those
cases
go
on
the
construction
of
the
resolution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
did
they
go
on
constitutionality.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
miller
and
rau,
on
those
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
go
on
construction
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
namely
the
--
namely
the
reservation
of
was
to
render
collate
--
what
was
being
collated
and
not
the
reserve
of
power
that
might
have
been
exercised
while
war
is
on,
to
be
exercised
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
no
to
the
wars'
authoritative
determination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
if
it's
--
if
it's
a
question
of
construct,
made
this
resolution
of
1953.that's
right,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
resolution
construable
as
a
matter
of
construction
cannot
be
mailed,
cannot
be
interpreted,
so
does
not
cover
the
situation?
all
we
get
is
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
there's
another
difficulty
of
the
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
look
at
it,
namely
that
it
specify
the
(inaudible)
for
which
has
heretofore,
invested
or
seized
so
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
they're
saying
is
this.
that
although
congress
may
have
postponed
the
declaration
of
the
termination
of
war
here,
october
19
--
whatever
it
was
july
of
1953.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
congress
may
have
postponed
the
congressional
declaration
as
the
war
has
terminated
as
of
the
date
to
be
attached
to
the
joint
resolution
of
reservation
if
in
fact
it
doesn't
prove
that
but
terminates
the
war.
it
can
also
reserve
the
exercise
of
war
power
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
to
termination
of
war.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
proposition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
congress,
in
its
wisdom,
may
take
type
of
step,
may
--
may
make
contractual
arrangements
giving
every
characteristic
or
incidents
of
--
of
--
presently,
equal
solid
relation
yet
withhold,
if
i
may
think
should
be,
we
think
the
war
is
over
for
all
institutional
purposes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
(voice
overlap)
--
i
was
merely
commenting
on
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
1952,
1952
is
very
different
from
what
it
is
in
53.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
we
come
to
these
--
certainly
if
it
goes
to
the
united
states.
while
reaching
constitutional
international
law
problem,
what
in
your
views
are
the
questions
that
may
be
settle
from
your
point
of
view,
not
in
the
subject
of
those
statutes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
not
--
can
one
be
dealt
with
matters
about
that?
(inaudible)
can
one
be
dealt
with
matters
about
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
to
say
there
weren't
any
offenses
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
can
one
be
sure
about
it
as
a
matter
of
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
man
can
go
to
court
and
file
a
piece
of
paper
but
what
chance
could
he
have
here
with
the
protection
of
that
right
according
to
new
york
law
or
the
bill
of
that
law
in
the
new
york
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
particular
order.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
may
be
protected
by
the
new
york
constitution,
yet
so
is
your
motion,
you
point
that
you
have
a
federal
interest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
this
the
day
after
the
resolution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
the
vesting
order,
was
the
vesting
order
--
is
that
repeat
by
one
male
in
termination
of
this
whole
business?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
understood
mr.
lourie,
he
said,
this
vesting
order
was
one
minute
before
midnight
at
the
court
before
the
person
is
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
account
on
what
the
power
of
control,
effective
control
that
you
haven't
discussed?
is
that
substantially
accurate,
to
stay
off,
reinvest,
all
of
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
in
case
you
prevail,
would
you
have
that
control
over
the
trust?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
between
--
between
prevailing
in
this
suit
and
beginning
of
9
(a)
trust
would
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
then
have
freedom
of
action
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
reinvest,
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
--
how
many
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
but
it
has
the
question
of
agreement
that
--
if
the
board
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
court
restrictions
depending
to
suit
as
i
really
agree
is
having
freedom
of
action
in
the
conscience
of
exercise
of
the
trustee?
justice
felix
frankfurter
automatically,
you're
--
you
have
held
the
status
quo,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
is
a
matter
of
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
how
much
of
the
20%
was
thought
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
offenses,
do
you
know
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
there
been
any
policy
adopted
yet
that
would
show
what
is
the
purpose
of
--
what
the
congress
--
what
should
be
done
with
the
funds
of
aliens
now,
except
divested
in
the
alien
property
custodian?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
on
the
line.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
read
the
act
itself
and
then
--
as
providing
for
confiscation
of
the
property
of
the
alien
by
this
country?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that,
if
i
may
just
spoke
in
that
way,
these
funds
will
bail
out
the
obligation
of
germany
in
its
own
action.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
and
feel
free
to
say
that
the
--
you're
not
free
to
answer
it
because
i
don't
want
to
trench
you
on
what
counsel
may
do
replace
litigation
in
both
agendas
since
you're
not
prepared,
but
if
you
can,
may
i
ask
you
this.
you
can
answer
that.
in
fact,
you're
going
to
answer
this
question.
in
case
the
order
of
the
judgment
below
stands,
what
relief
in
opinion
is
open
with
this
government?
you
assert
such
right
is
claimed
here
in
the
state
of
the
institution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
point
of
that?
what
is
the
point
of
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
searls,
if
you
say
that
you
already
have
two
judgments
against
you,
if
you
claim
that
each
judgment
haven't
foreclosed
this
issue,
why
would
it
be
foreclosing
the
new
proceeding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
why
can't
you
set
that
in
the
state
court,
unless
you
are
foreclosed
by
the
prior
judgment.
and
it
could
only
be
foreclosed
if
a
treaty
isn't
filed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
may
i
say
that
i
think
nothing
has
been
said
in
reply
to
my
question.
it
would
be
fairer
if
it's
quoted
against
you,
whichever
way
this
litigation
may
go
into
the
(inaudible)
because
i
don't
think
counsel
will
be
held
to
this
type
of
litigation.
and
the
hypothetical
question
is
seeking
litigation.
at
least,
it
has
never
appealed
to
me
but
that's
practically
the
law
the
way
it
should
be
filed.
