mr.
arthur
j.
o'leary
if
the
court
pleases,
one
of
the
important
questions
on
this
appeal
is
that
question
of
res
judicata,
and
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
that
phase
of
this
case.
and
in
doing
so,
i'll
refer
again
briefly
to
those
findings
of
fact
that
were
made
in
the
prior
action,
which
i've
been
referred
to
before,
concerning
the
disposition
of
income.
in
that
prior
action,
in
the
--
mr.
arthur
j.
o'leary
you'll
find
those,
your
honor,
at
page
222
of
the
record.
those
findings
with
respect
to
income,
read
in
part
of
many
--
some
of
the
words,
which
i
don't
think
is
significant
here.
but
so,
we'll
have
the
substance
of
them
that
the
attorney
general
is
not
entitled
to
receive
the
income
of
the
said
trust
which
had
been
accumulated
as
of
the
date
of
the
making
of
the
vesting
order,
referring
to
the
original
vesting
order.
in
number
10,
the
attorney
general
is
not
entitled
to
receive
any
part
of
the
accumulated
income
held
by
the
trustee,
which
has
been
collected
since
the
date
of
the
original
vesting
order.
and
then,
number
11,
that
the
attorney
general
as
alien
property
custodian
is
not
entitled
to
receive
any
income,
which
may
be
collected
during
the
lifetime
of
bruno
reinicke,
his
set
law
and
said
trust.
now,
i
would
like
to
show
in
a
practical
way
how
that
prior
judgment
will
be
circumvented,
and
i
think
in
part
destroyed,
if
the
attorney
general
gets
the
relief
that
he
seeks
in
this
action.
and
i
can
demonstrate
that
by
asking
your
honor
to
look
or
to
take
my
description
of
it
at
the
schedule
of
the
account
at
page
260
of
the
record.
unmet
schedule
is
listed
in
a
few
items.
what
happened
to
the
accumulated
income
and
the
amount
of
it?
at
page
260
of
the
record,
it
shows
that
there
has
been
accumulated
in
these
trusts
and
headed
to
the
corpus,
the
total
sum
of
$116,576.75.
that
is
the
income
that
had
been
accumulated
in
that
accumulated
cents.
that
is
the
income
which
those
findings
of
fact
that
i
referred
to,
refer
to.
that
income
was
adjudged
to
be
in
the
possession
and
--
and
it
should
remain
a
possession
of
the
trustee.
now,
it's
the
attorney
general
who
gets
the
relief
that
he
asks
for
here.
that
income
will
be
turned
over
to
the
attorney
general,
and
to
that
extent,
that
prior
judgment
would
be
circumvented
and
in
part,
destroyed.
now,
in
arguing
at
the
prior
action,
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
either
possession
or
the
vesting
of
the
race.
it
certainly
would
seem
to
be
the
correct
fact
that
the
prior
judgment
did
have
something
to
do
with
possession.
certainly,
plainly
so,
with
respect
to
that
accumulated
income
which
i
have
just
described,
the
possession
of
that
was
litigated
in
past
time.
and
furthermore,
i
think
the
vesting
of
the
race
itself
was
a
matter
which
was
the
subject
of
the
litigation
in
the
prior
action.
and
i
say
that
basing
it
upon
the
language
of
the
original
vesting
order,
that
original
vesting
order
which
is
printed
at
--
beginning
at
page
67
of
the
record.
in
the
opening
part
of
it,
it
refers
to
property
described
as,
“all
right
title
and
interest”
of
bruno
reinicke
and
others
as
being
property
payable
to
enemy
nationals.
because
i
might
say
though,
that
such
property,
is
in
the
process
of
administration
by
the
chase
national
bank
as
trustee
of
its
trust
dated
so
and
so,
under
the
judicial
supervision
of
the
supreme
court.
now,
when
i
say
that
in
that
original
order,
they
refer
to
something
in
addition
to
the
right
title
and
interest
of
the
aliens,
they
are
vesting
also
the
very
property
itself.
when
they
use
the
words
“property”
in
the
process
of
administration,
i
don't
think
the
man
who
wrote
that
intended
to
say
or
imply
that
they
were
--
that
they
were
administrating
rights
and
interest.
he
meant,
the
securities
would
be
in,
and
the
trustee
itself
was
being
administered.
and
that
i
think
is
evident
by
what
follows
was
that
paragraph,
beginning
at
the
top
of
page
71,
which
reads,
“hereby
vest
in
the
alien
property
custodian,
the
property
described
above
to
be
held
used,
administered,
liquidated,
sold
or
otherwise
dealt
with.”
now,
we
don't
liquidate
and
sell
rights
and
interest.
at
language,
it's
only
fitted
to
me
the
securities,
the
funds
that
comprise
the
purpose
of
this
trust.
now,
the
attorney
general
labels
this
original
vesting
order
that
i
have
just
quoted
as
a
right
title
and
interest
order.
and
he
said,
“that
was
all
up
before
the
court
in
the
prior
action.”
but
that
--
that
original
order
contain
that
language
that
i
referred
to
referring
to
properties
that
can
be
bought
and
sold
which
i
say
refers
to
the
purpose
of
the
trust.
now,
if
we
look
at
the
so-called
raised
vesting
order,
which,
however,
in
this
preparation
by
the
alien
property
custodian
was
labelled
as
an
amendment
to
the
original
vesting
order,
the
language
of
that
is
not
legally
different
from
the
language
of
the
original
order.
there,
the
same
nationals
i
referred
to
--
mr.
arthur
j.
o'leary
that
--
that
begins
at
page
72
of
the
record.
the
opening
part
of
it,
they
referred
to
enemy
nationals.
and
then,
on
page
74,
in
paragraph
2,
they
say,
“all
property
in
the
custody
of
the
chase
bank,
its
trustee,
et
cetera.”
and
then,
in
the
last
paragraph,
page
75,
that
property
just
referred
to
was
vested.
that,
i
say
is
the
same
property
that
would
describe
and
referred
to
in
the
original
vesting
order,
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
illegal
significance
or
any
legal
difference
in
the
need
of
either
document,
and
the
first
document
was
before
the
court.
now,
there
is
one
other
phase
of
this
case
that
i
want
to
refer
to.
the
attorney
general
wants
to
relegate
the
ultimate
beneficiary
of
this
fund.
mr.
arthur
j.
o'leary
in
the
prior
action?
mr.
arthur
j.
o'leary
he
--
he
demanded
that
the
entire
purpose
of
the
trustee
turned
over
to
him
upon
termination
of
the
trust.
he
plainly
demanded
that.
because
bruno
reinicke
--
because
the
trust
agreement
itself
provided
that
all
income
shall
be
added
to
principles
and
--
unless
bruno
reinicke
directed
it
to
go
otherwise.
the
attorney
general
demanded.
he
said
he
had
seized
that
right
and
he
demanded
the
income.
now,
also,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
that
part
of
it
--
mr.
arthur
j.
o'leary
the
right
and
the
income.
now,
and
he
also
--
there's
a
dispute
about
this
part
of
it.
the
appellants
claim
the
attorney
general
and
his
--
and
the
court
of
appeals
demanded
the
entire
purpose,
but
the
petitioner
puts
a
different
construction
on
that
and
he
says,
“he
did
only
by
way
of
argument.”
he
says,
“if
he
can't
get
it.”
he
said,
“he
argued
there,
but
he
couldn't
get
despite
to
direct
income.”
then,
the
trust
had
terminated,
and
therefore,
he
went
to
the
entire
principle.
now,
i
want
to
say
a
few
words
about
that
section
9
(a).
if
the
attorney
general
gets
the
relief
that
he
wants
in
this
action,
then
the
ultimate
remainder
of
the
trust,
if
it
turns
out
to
be
this
american
citizen.
so,
the
attorney
general
says,
“he
has
a
right
to
come
in
under
section
9
(a),
and
bring
a
suit
for
recovery.”
but,
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
there's
a
statute
of
limitations
on
claims.
anybody
who
claims
to
be
entitled
a
property
that's
taken
over
by
the
alien
property
custodian
must
bring
a
suit
no
later
than
two
years
from
the
date
of
vesting
all
seizure
as
statute
of
limitations
of
the
50
u.s.c.
section
33.
now,
this
trust,
as
we
already
know,
will
not
terminate
until
the
two
lives
are
being
expired.
now,
that
may
be
ex
number
of
years.
if
it's
10,
11,
or
20
by
that
time,
the
rights
of
the
argument
remained
in
them
with
a
long
sense
of
vanished
under
that
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
arthur
j.
o'leary
well,
i
would
your
honor,
because
the
statute
of
limitation
says,
“any
right
to
recover
property
that
has
been
seized
or
vested
in
the
attorney
--
in
the
alien
property
custodian,
such
an
action
must
be
commenced
in
the
words
of
the
statute.”
these
are
the
words
--
mr.
arthur
j.
o'leary
no
suit
--
mr.
arthur
j.
o'leary
--
no
suit
pursuant
to
--
pursuant
to
section
9.
that's
the
section
he
refers
to.
no
suit
pursuant
to
section
9
may
be
instituted
after
april
30th,
1949,
or
after
the
expiration
of
two
years
from
the
date
of
seizure
by
or
vesting
in
the
alien
property
custodian,
as
the
case
may
be,
of
the
property
or
interest
in
respect
of
which
relief
is
sought,
whichever
is
later.
mr.
arthur
j.
o'leary
well,
i'm
--
i'm
afraid
it
would
because
it
--
it
doesn't
say
that
you
bring
the
action
within
two
years
after
your
cause
of
action
accrues.
it
says,
“no
action
can
be
brought
later
than
two
years
after
the
date
of
seizure
or
date
of
vesting.”
now,
i
don't
think
that
you
have
any
other
reason
for
construction
of
that
as
i
read
it.
and
there
was
one
case
where
a
man
was
unavoidably
absent,
your
honor.
in
the
circuit
court
here,
passed
against
mcgrath,
he
was
out
of
the
country.
and
when
he
got
here,
his
two
years
had
expired
and
he
was
denied
of
recovery.
now,
and
then,
in
closing,
i
think
the
alien
property
custodian
had
been
fully
protected
here,
no
respondent
questions
or
fact
that
whatever
the
rights
of
these
aliens
are,
they
have
been
seized.
and
when
the
trust
terminates,
the
chase
bank
can't
pay
that
money,
except
to
the
persons
legally
entitled
to
it,
if
it
turns
out
that
their
--
that
this
group
of
enemy
aliens,
that's
where
the
money
would
go.
he
turns
out
to
be
an
american
citizen,
the
american
citizen
will
get.
mr.
arthur
j.
o'leary
that's
the
--
that's
a
present
decision,
the
present
action,
i
guess.
mr.
arthur
j.
o'leary
yes.
just
a
minute,
i'll
tell
you
what
i
think,
your
honor.
i
quoted
from
it
at
page
222,
see
where
the
opening
pages
--
mr.
arthur
j.
o'leary
the
--
the
judgment
in
that
prior
action,
your
honor,
is
mentioned
at
page
211.
