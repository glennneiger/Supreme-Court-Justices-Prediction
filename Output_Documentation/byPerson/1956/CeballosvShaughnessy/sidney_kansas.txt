mr.
sidney
kansas
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
sidney
kansas
this
case
is
much
more
simple
than
the
preceding
one.
this
case
is
in
the
field
of
immigration,
naturalization
and
deportation.
two
questions
are
involved.
one,
in
an
action
brought
in
the
u.s.district
court
for
declaratory
judgment
to
declare
the
petitioner
eligible
for
naturalization
in
order
that
he
may
apply
for
suspension
of
a
deportation
and
where
the
district
director
is
made
a
party.
is
the
attorney
general
an
indispensable
party?
that's
been
a
troublesome
question
for
years.
the
district
court
dismissed
solely
on
the
ground
that
the
attorney
general
was
not
made
a
party
without
going
into
the
merits
or
the
subsequent
part
of
the
problem.
the
court
below
--
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
affirmed
this
court
in
the
pedreiro
case,
decided
about
a
year
ago,
that
the
attorney
general
is
not
an
indispensable
party
in
this
kind
of
actions.
the
district
director
is
a
sufficient
party.
and
the
court
below,
mindful
of
a
decision
of
this
court,
preferred
to
follow
its
reasoning
in
the
vaz
case,
v-a-z,
decided
by
that
court
in
1953.
the
reasoning
there
was
that
when
an
alien
is
ordered
deported
and
he
applies
for
a
suspension
of
deportation,
then
he
is
seeking
discretionary
relief
and
therefore
the
attorney
general
is
an
indispensable
party.
the
case
before
this
court
in
pedreiro,
the
alien
was
ordered
deported,
did
not
seek
suspension
of
deportation
but
resisted
deportation
on
constitutional
ground.
now,
the
court
below
expressed
doubt
as
to
the
correctness
of
its
rule
for
it
drew
a
very
fine
line
of
distinction
between
the
vaz
case,
that
it
decided
and
which
does
not
reach
this
court,
and
the
pedreiro
case
decided
by
this
court.
and
in
its
opinion
on
page
18
which
stated,
“although
the
question
is
not
free
from
doubt,
we
shall
follow
our
reasoning
of
the
vaz
case
while
the
supreme
court
may
decide
that
the
distinction
no
longer
holds,
we
do
not
think
this
is
to
be
spelled
out
of
mr.
justice
black's
opinion
of
pedreiro
case.”
now,
the
district
court
--
mr.
sidney
kansas
yes,
sir.
mr.
sidney
kansas
well
in
their
appeal
--
in
their
brief,
they
stated
they
do
not
agree
with
the
court
below
that
the
attorney
general
as
an
indispensable
party,
and
that
in
the
future
the
policy
of
the
government
will
be
not
to
require
the
attorney
general
as
a
party.
however,
we
are
confronted
with
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
until
--
mr.
sidney
kansas
sir?
mr.
sidney
kansas
yes,
but
we
have
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
--
until
it's
reversed,
we
are
confronted
with
an
insurmountable
obstacle.
that
is
the
reason
i'm
bringing
up
the
attention
of
this
court.
mr.
sidney
kansas
all
right.
if
we
are
relieved
of
that
in
the
future
then
we
don't
have
to
join
the
attorney
general,
why
i'm
satisfied
with
that
one,
so
i'll
pass
right
on
the
second
question.
mr.
sidney
kansas
now,
during
the
war
years
in
1942
to
1945,
all
male
residents
of
the
united
states
were
required
to
register
under
the
draft
as
it's
well-known.
and
if
there
were
those
who
desire
to
be
relieved
or
exempted
from
the
draft,
they'd
file
a
form
301
and
it
was
then
the
selective
service
board's
duty
to
inform
the
alien
that
he
has
been
relieved
and
exempted
in
accordance
with
the
rules
and
regulations.
however,
if
this
application
that
he
filed
was
accepted
and
he
was
so
informed
then
he
forfeited
his
right
for
naturalization.
however,
if
the
application
was
disregarded
and
he
was
placed
in
class
i-a,
ordered
to
appear
for
preinduction
and
physical
examination
then
he
was
not
exempted
and
hence
did
not
lose
his
right
for
naturalization.
now,
having
passed
point
one,
as
i
said,
i
will
concentrate
my
--
on
question
number
two.
perhaps,
at
this
point
it's
best
to
give
a
very
brief
statement
of
the
case.
the
alien
is
a
man
about
42
years
of
age,
born
in
the
republic
of
columbia,
south
america.
he
first
entered
the
united
states
on
a
visa
for
permanent
residence
in
february
1942.
in
may
of
that
year,
he
registered
for
the
draft.
after
waiting
more
than
a
year,
not
having
heard
anything
from
the
draft,
and
in
august
of
1943,
he
appeared
before
the
board,
filed
his
form
301
requesting
to
be
exempted
and
relieved
from
the
draft.
the
board
did
nothing
until
january
of
1944,
when
they
informed
him
that
--
that
they
have
disregarded
his
application
and
he
has
been
placed
in
class
i-a,
ordered
to
appear
from
preinduction
and
physical
examination.
he
appeared
on
the
day
set
and
the
physical
examination
showed
that
he
was
suffering
from
some
kidney
ailment
and
he
was
reclassified
and
placed
in
class
iv-f.
now,
from
the
time
of
his
first
entry
in
1942
until
his
last
reentry
in
april
of
1951,
he
had
made
several
departures
and
reentries.
and
during
one
of
the
last
reentries
in
november
1950,
he
remained
in
new
york
city
until
january
of
1951,
married
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
by
birth
and
the
next
day
departed
for
france
for
honeymoon.
in
february,
next
month
1951,
they
decided
to
reenter
the
united
states.
the
wife,
travelling
on
an
american
passport,
had
no
difficulty
but
the
petitioner
could
not
obtain
a
visa
to
reenter
the
united
states
on
a
visa
for
permanent
residence.
the
counsel
having
knowledge
that
he
had
filed
a
petition
which
barred
him
from
citizenship
could
not
get
him
a
visa
for
permanent
residence.
the
best
he
could
do
was
to
give
him
a
--
a
transit
visa
which
is
good
for
21
days
stay
in
the
united
states.
he
entered
on
this
transit
visa,
and
on
the
23rd
day
after
his
entry
he
was
served
with
a
warrant
of
arrest
and
a
deportation
proceedings,
taken
to
the
immigration
service,
given
a
hearing
why
he
should
not
be
deported,
having
overstayed
his
time
by
a
few
days.
during
the
hearing,
he
applied
for
suspension
of
deportation,
and
the
hearing
officer
said,
"that
must
be
denied
because
you
are
not
eligible
for
naturalization.
you
have
filed
a
petition
to
be
exempted
and
relieved
in
the
war
act."
now,
he
appealed
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
and
that
board
likewise
held
that
the
mere
filing
of
the
petition
is
sufficient
to
bargain
from
naturalization.
then
his
only
recourse
was
to
the
united
states
district
court,
and
in
that
court,
as
i
already
stated,
the
court
dismissed
solely
on
the
ground
that
the
attorney
general
was
not
made
a
party.
therefore,
have
no
chance
to
state
his
case
before
that
court.
now,
i
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
the
--
there
was
error
on
the
part
of
the
court
below
in
holding
that
the
mere
filing
of
a
petition
is
sufficient
to
bar
from
--
for
naturalization.
now,
the
court
--
bear
with
me
for
a
moment.
the
court
below
stated
that
section
303
of
title
50
of
the
united
states
code,
i'm
reading
on
page
19
of
my
brief,
"provides
that
an
alien
who
has
made
application
to
be
relieved
from
military
service
shall
thereafter
be
debarred
from
becoming
a
citizen
of
united
states."
and
plaintiff
made
such
an
application
and
hence
is
not
eligible
for
an
order
suspending
deportation,
but
other
courts
of
appeals
don't
agree
with
them.
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
takes
an
entirely
different
view
of
the
subject,
and
other
courts
as
well.
now,
the
district
courts,
they
do
--
one
of
the
district
court,
eastern
district
of
new
york
states,
"two
conditions
are
requisites,
the
application
for
exemption
and
a
record
that
he
was
relieved
or
discharged
from
training
or
service.
these
requisites
are
not
stated
under
disjunctive
and
if
either
fails
the
statutory
ineligibility
does
not
become
automatic
for
one
is
of
equal
importance
to
the
other.
and
then
we
have
the
district
court
of
california.
the
courts
held
there,
the
intention
of
the
act
plainly
was
to
fixate
penalty
where
an
alien
declarant
was
relieved
from
military
service,
page
10,
bottom
of
page
10
of
my
petition.
and
this
case,
the
government
did
not
relieve
the
declarant
from
service.
hence,
no
exemption
right
was
accorded
him
and
he
should
not
be
held
to
have
incurred
the
penalty
affixed.
and
right
here
in
washington,
same
situation
as
we
have
in
our
case.
an
alien
appeared
and
registered,
waiting
over
a
year,
nothing
happened.
he
was
not
notified
whether
he
was
in
or
out,
so
he
filed
an
application
for
naturalization
in
the
district
court
here,
and
the
court
granted
it.
the
government
appealed,
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
held,
top
of
page
60
in
my
brief,
"to
debar
the
appellee
from
citizenship,
the
statute
requires
proof,
not
only
that
he
applied
for
exemption
on
grounds
of
alienage,
but
also
that
he
was
relieved
from
serving
for
that
reason."
the
examiner's
legal
conclusion
that
appellee
was
relieved
from
military
service
because
of
alienage
is
not
supported
by
any
evidence
in
the
present
record.
we
think
the
total
absence
of
any
such
essential
evidence
is
a
sufficient
basis
for
affirming
the
district
court's
order
granting
naturalization.
now,
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
--
the
record
not
only
establishes
that
the
petitioner
was
not
relieved
from
military
service
because
of
alienage,
but
affirmatively
shows
that
he
was
in
fact
classified
i-a,
and
held
liable
to
be
called
up
for
service.
therefore,
our
case
is
much
stronger
than
the
one
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
this
--
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
sidney
kansas
that
--
page
16
is
the
court
opinion.
mr.
sidney
kansas
yes,
sir.
mr.
sidney
kansas
that's
it.
mr.
sidney
kansas
now,
we're
getting
down
to
the
statute.
mr.
sidney
kansas
that's
it.
the
two
statutes
--
mr.
sidney
kansas
--
that
cover
this
situation.
now,
the
statute
will
be
found
in
page
2
and
3
of
my
brief.
the
statutes
are
the
selective
training
and
service
act
of
1940,
as
amended,
and
section
315
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952.
mr.
sidney
kansas
the
1952
clarifies
the
statute,
if
your
honor
pleases.
if
i
may
--
now
on
page
48,
the
government
also
has
those
statutes
and
i'll
be
very
short,
i
would
like
to
read
it.
mr.
sidney
kansas
i'm
going
to
read
page
48,
the
government's
brief.
mr.
sidney
kansas
the
statute
is
the
selective
training
and
service
act
of
1940,
as
amended.
"except
as
otherwise
provided
in
this
act,
every
male
citizen
and
every
other
male
person
residing
in
the
united
states,
who
is
between
the
ages
of
19
and
45
shall
be
liable
for
training
and
service
in
the
land
or
naval
forces
of
the
united
states,
provided,
that
any
citizen
or
subject
of
a
neutral
country
shall
be
relieved
from
liability
for
training
and
service
under
this
act
if,
prior
to
his
induction
into
the
land
or
naval
forces,
he
has
made
application
to
be
relieved
from
such
liability
in
the
manner
prescribed
by
and
in
accordance
with
rules
and
regulations
prescribed
by
the
president,
but
any
person
who
makes
such
application
shall
thereafter
be
debarred
from
becoming
a
citizen
of
the
united
states."
and
right
there
just
trouble
spot
that
last
phrase.
the
court
below
seized
upon
that
and
said
here,
that
whoever
makes
such
an
application
shall
thereafter
be
debarred
from
becoming
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
well,
you
can't
read
that
in
this
--
disjunctive.
you
have
to
take
that
whole
section.
we
might
have
repeated
that.
congress
might
have
repeated
that.
it
will
be
a
repetition
by
saying,
"that
equation
to
make
such
application
in
the
manner
prescribed
by
and
in
accordance
with
the
rules
and
regulations
shall
be
--
shall
thereafter
be
debarred
from
becoming
a
citizen
of
the
united
states."
that
will
be
clearly
repetitious.
so
that
this
last
phrase
is
as
i
said
the
trouble
spot
and
that's
upon
that.
the
court
below
depended
and
decided
--
mr.
sidney
kansas
--
at
this
case.
mr.
sidney
kansas
because
you've
got
to
read
that
whole
section.
mr.
sidney
kansas
well,
in
--
yes.
on
page
13
of
my
brief,
you'll
find
the
rules
and
regulations
provided
--
mr.
sidney
kansas
the
rule
--
no,
the
rules
and
regulations
prescribed
the
manner
of
--
just
as
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
held.
the
rules
and
regulation
on
page
13
of
my
brief,
if
the
court
pleases,
states
--
and
there
found
in
title
32,
page
13
of
my
brief,
title
32,
code
of
federal
regulations,
section
622
and
623,
provided
--
mr.
sidney
kansas
13,
sir.
mr.
sidney
kansas
page
13,
middle
of
the
page,
provided
that
an
alien
registrant
of
a
neutral
country
who
files
a
form
301
with
his
local
board
shall
be
placed
in
class
iv-c,
which
is
the
exempted
and
relieved
class.
and
section
623
of
the
regulations
prescribed
prompt
classification
of
a
registrant
in
accordance
with
stated
principles.
and
section
623.61
make
mandatory
the
mailing
to
the
registrant
of
notice
of
his
classification
and
the
proper
recording
in
the
selective
service
files
of
such
classification.
not
until
all
of
these
steps
have
been
completed
was
the
alien
classified
as
exempt
and
exempted.
until
the
completion
of
the
prescribed
classification
procedure,
his
liability
for
service
and
training
remain
unclear.
and
those
are
the
rules
and
regulations
that
i
referred
to
in
this
--
of
the
selective
training
and
service
act
that
i
just
read.
now,
let's
turn
to
section
315
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
also
on
page
49
of
the
brief
for
the
respondent.
now,
not
--
i'm
reading
down
towards
the
bottom
of
the
page,
notwithstanding
the
provisions
of
section
405
(b)
--
now,
that
section
405
(b)
if
i
may
just
stop
for
a
moment
to
say,
pertains
to
carrying
over
the
suspension
cases
that
were
then
pending
prior
to
the
enactment
of
1952
act,
carried
them
over
into
the
1952
act.
therefore,
notwithstanding
the
provisions
of
section
405
(b),
any
alien
who
applies
or
has
applied
for
exemption
or
discharge
from
training
or
service
in
the
armed
forces
or
in
the
national
security
training
corps
of
the
unites
states
on
the
ground
that
he
is
an
alien,
doesn't
say
anything
about
a
neutral
alien,
an
alien,
and
is
or
was
relieved
or
discharged
from
such
training
or
service
on
such
ground,
shall
be
permanently
ineligible
to
become
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
and
that
is
what
i
had
in
answer
to
justice
douglas'
question
about
315
of
the
1952
act.
mr.
sidney
kansas
well,
they're
both.
one
--
one
clarifies
the
1952
and
the
1940
act.
this
is
a
much
later
act.
they
both
pertain,
sir,
to
discharge
from
such
service
in
--
in
accordance
with
the
rules
and
regulations.
this
says,
"was
relieved
or
discharged
from
such
training
and
service
in
such
ground,
shall
be
permanently
ineligibly
become
a
citizen
of
the
united
states."
this
alien
was
never
discharged.
he
was
never
classified
in
iv-c.
he
always
remained
subject
to
call.
he
was
in
class
iv-f.
and
--
and
therefore,
we
--
our
contention
is
that
there
be
no
exemption
and
no
relief.
he
did
not
forfeit
his
right
to
file
an
application
for
a
suspension
of
deportation
because
the
exemption
was
denied
the
--
the
suspension
of
deportation
was
denied
at
him
because
of
ineligibility
to
naturalization.
so
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
held.
now,
we
filed
a
declaratory
--
petition
for
a
declaratory
judgment
in
the
district
court.
now,
the
district
court
has
--
mr.
sidney
kansas
sir?
mr.
sidney
kansas
well,
made
him
iv-a.
mr.
sidney
kansas
i
don't
see,
sir,
where
that
has
because
section
315
makes
no
mention
of
any
belligerency
or
any
neutral
alien,
just
as
an
alien.
mr.
sidney
kansas
i
don't
see
any
difference,
sir.
mr.
sidney
kansas
there
is
nothing
or
no
difference
in
the
act
itself.
mr.
sidney
kansas
they
--
they
have
mentioned
something
here.
i
noticed
about
the
--
the
coincidental
situation
of
the
--
going
into
the
war,
columbia
and
becoming
belligerent.
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
it?
mr.
sidney
kansas
there's
no
relation
to
it
at
all.
well,
that's
my
--
i've
started
this
thing.
i
couldn't
find
whether
there's
any
relation.
he's
an
alien,
primarily
alienist.
that's
what
controls.
now,
as
one
point
i'd
like
to
take
up
here,
the
--
the
respondent
--
i
submitted
a
brief
of
--
of
53
pages.
well,
about
20
of
those
pages
are
devoted
in
an
attempt
to
justify
the
court
below
in
holding
that
the
mere
filling,
ipso
facto,
the
mere
filing
of
the
application
bars
him
from
citizenship.
there
was
no
such
intention
of
congress
on
that.
for
if
you
use
the
reasoning
of
that
rationale,
suppose
a
man
files
it
and
as
in
this
case
placed
in
class
i-a,
he
is
subsequently
sent
on
the
other
side,
he
comes
back
as
an
amputee.
would
the
--
would
the
congress
then
say
he
is
still
not
eligible
for
citizenship?
mr.
sidney
kansas
all
right.
mr.
sidney
kansas
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justice
of
the
court.
may
i,
this
time,
take
one
or
two
minutes
to
refer
back
to
question
number
one,
not
for
argument
just
--
mr.
sidney
kansas
--
just
to
take
the
relief.
mr.
sidney
kansas
and
as
much
as
the
government
does
not
approve
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
that
the
attorney
general
as
an
indispensable
party
and
thereby
concedes
that
he
is
not
indispensable
in
the
present
case.
and
then
as
much
as
the
district
court
dismissed
solely
on
the
ground
that
the
attorney
general
was
not
made
a
party
and
which
decision
was
approved
by
the
court
below.
i,
therefore,
ask
for
relief
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
and
the
district
court
to
be
reversed
as
to
the
indispensability
of
the
attorney
general
in
order
that
the
case
maybe
remanded
to
the
district
court,
in
order
to
proceed
that
they
hear
the
petition
on
the
merits.
now,
i'll
proceed
to
the
second
phase
of
it.
now,
there
--
to
me,
that's
--
it
is
a
very
simple
matter.
there
are
two
sections
of
the
law
required
interpretation.
i
am
guided
in
my
interpretation
of
the
selective
training
and
service
act
and
section
315
by
the
unanimous
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
other
federal
courts.
now,
the
point
involved
here
is
whether
this
alien
forfeited
his
right
to
naturalization
and
whether
he
is
no
longer
eligible
for
him
to
apply.
why?
because
he
has
merely
filed
an
application
which
was
not
accepted,
quite
the
contrary,
he
was
placed
in
class
i-a,
ordered
to
appear
for
preinduction
and
physical
examination.
and
therefore,
and
so
the
court
of
appeals
hold,
he
was
not
exempted.
now,
in
the
application
for
a
certificate
of
naturalization,
it
doesn't
necessarily
follow
that
it
will
be
granted.
it
may
be
denied.
that's
only
the
preliminary
step.
there
are
some
of
the
other
things
that
he
must
comply
with,
so
many
other
rules
and
regulations,
such
as
showing
that
as
a
question
of
good
moral
character
as
the
court
is
well
familiar
with
those
requirements
and
it
must
reside
a
minimum
period
of
time
and
that
he
is
not
connected
with
any
subversive
activities
and
many
others.
before,
the
naturalization
service
will
be
granted.
likewise
here,
if
it
is
found
that
he
is
eligible
for
naturalization
that
doesn't
mean
that
he
may
apply
for
naturalization
even
in
the
near
future.
but
that
eligibility
gives
him
the
privilege
of
applying
for
a
suspension
of
his
deportation.
without
that
eligibility,
he
cannot
even
apply
for
suspension
of
his
deportation
in
this
case.
now
as
i
stated
yesterday,
this
man
is
a
highly
intellectual
man,
well-educated,
has
a
home
of
his
own
in
(inaudible)
and
he
is
married
to
a
woman
who
was
born
in
the
united
states
and
they
have
three
small
children
all
born
in
the
united
states.
now,
what
we
are
trying
--
mr.
sidney
kansas
well
--
mr.
sidney
kansas
--
we'll
read
it
--
mr.
sidney
kansas
--
we'll
read
the
statute
exactly
and
i
will
also
like
to
reply
to
justice
douglas'
question
about
the
section
315
as
it
fits
in
there.
now,
section
315,
i'm
reading
now
page
4
of
my
brief,
the
bottom
of
page,
section
315
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952,
(a),
subdivision
(a)
--
mr.
sidney
kansas
yes,
sir,
that
of
the
other
act
on
page
3.
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
3,
which
is
section
3
(a)
of
the
selective
training
and
service
act
of
1940.
mr.
sidney
kansas
virtually,
the
same
as
315
and
here's
what
it
reads.
here
--
here's
how
it
reads
at
the
time
he
made
his
application.
mr.
sidney
kansas
except
as
otherwise
provided
in
this
act,
every
male
citizen
and
every
other
male
prisoners
residing
in
the
united
states
who
is
between
the
ages
of
19
and
45
shall
be
liable
for
training
and
service
in
the
land,
the
naval
forces
of
the
united
states,
provided,
that
any
citizen
or
subject
of
a
neutral
country
shall
be
relieved
from
liability
for
training
and
service
under
this
act
if,
prior
to
his
induction
into
the
land
or
naval
forces,
he
has
made
application
to
be
relieved
from
such
liability
in
the
manner
prescribed
by
and
in
accordance
with
rules
and
regulations
prescribed
by
the
president,
but
any
person
who
makes
such
application
shall
thereafter
be
debarred
from
becoming
a
citizen
of
the
united
states,
providing,
he
is
exempted
and
relieved.
mr.
sidney
kansas
i
just
read
the
statute
and
finished
it.
mr.
sidney
kansas
no,
that
last
part
is
my
own.
i
--
i
--
mr.
sidney
kansas
--
i
should
have
said
end
of
quotes.
mr.
sidney
kansas
i'll
repeat
that
again.
but
any
person
who
makes
such
application
shall
thereafter
be
debarred
from
becoming
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
mr.
sidney
kansas
he
made
an
application
but
it
was
not
granted.
mr.
sidney
kansas
yes.
mr.
sidney
kansas
top
of
page
5
of
my
brief
at
subdivision
(b)
of
section
315.
the
records
of
the
selective
service
system,
all
of
the
national
military
establishment
shall
be
conclusive
as
to
whether
an
alien
was
relieved
or
discharged
from
such
liability
for
training
or
service
because
he
was
an
alien.
and
right
here,
he
doesn't
say
that
he
is
neutrally,
he
merely
mentions
as
an
alien.
so,
that
if
he
was
not
discharged,
he
hasn't
forfeited
his
right
to
apply
for
naturalization.
if
he
was
discharged,
that's
there
is
to
it.
there's
nothing
can
be
done
about
it.
that
was
the
will
of
congress.
but
if
he
was
not
discharged
and
on
the
contrary
placed
in
i-a
order
to
appear
for
preinduction
and
physical
examination,
that's
not
a
discharge.
mr.
sidney
kansas
that
of
a
section
315,
are
you
referring
to,
your
honor?
mr.
sidney
kansas
the
section
(b),
the
record
of
the
selective
service
system.
mr.
sidney
kansas
yes,
that's
under
the
brief
--
mr.
sidney
kansas
all
right.
mr.
sidney
kansas
all
right.
now,
let's
read
section
315,
which
clarifies
and
i'll
go
into
a
little
bit
further
as
to
why
we
bring
in
the
315
here.
notwithstanding,
it's
virtually
the
same
as
i
have
read
under
selective
training,
notwithstanding
the
provision
of
section
405
(b),
which
i
will
explain
later,
any
alien
who
applies
or
has
applied
for
exemption
or
discharge
from
training
or
service
in
the
armed
forces
or
in
the
national
security
training
corps
of
the
united
states
on
the
ground
he
is
an
alien,
and
is
or
was
relieved
or
discharged
from
such
training
or
service
on
such
ground,
shall
be
permanently
ineligible
to
become
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
it's
virtually
the
same
wording
as
the
one
in
selective
training.
our
contention
--
mr.
sidney
kansas
well
--
mr.
sidney
kansas
relieved
or
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
sidney
kansas
yes,
that's
at
page
15.
mr.
sidney
kansas
all
right.
now,
what's
the
other
one?
he
says
--
the
other
one
says,
he
has
made
application
to
be
relieved
from
such
liability
in
the
manner
prescribed
by
and
in
accordance
with
rules
and
regulations
prescribed
by
the
president.
but
any
person
who
makes
such
application
shall
thereafter
be
debarred
from
citizen
of
the
united
states.
there
is
a
slight
differences
in
the
word
insofar
as
using
the
word
discharge
if
--
if
that's
what
your
honor
is
referring
to.
mr.
sidney
kansas
yes,
sir.
mr.
sidney
kansas
yes,
that's
true.
mr.
sidney
kansas
there
--
there's
where
the
trouble
comes
in.
mr.
sidney
kansas
that's
right.
mr.
sidney
kansas
that
is
true,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
sidney
kansas
well,
there
--
mr.
sidney
kansas
there
is
a
difference,
yes,
your
honor,
there
is
a
difference.
mr.
sidney
kansas
well,
if
--
if
all
that
congress
intended
was
to
deprive
this
man
of
the
right
to
apply
for
citizenship,
it
could
easily
have
said,
but
any
person
who
makes
an
application
to
be
relieved,
shall
thereafter
be
debarred
from
becoming
a
citizen
of
the
united
states,
but
they
said
a
whole
lot
more
than
that.
mr.
sidney
kansas
as
justice
black
said,
yes.
my
answer
would
be
yes,
i'd
combine
both.
mr.
sidney
kansas
i'm
asking
this
court
to
read
it
--
mr.
sidney
kansas
the
315
should
prevail
for
this
--
for
this
--
mr.
sidney
kansas
well,
i
would
have
to
fill
in
a
word
there
to
make
it
exactly
--
to
read
exactly.
but
as
justice
black
pointed
out,
there's
quite
a
difference
there.
my
answer
to
your
honor
would
be
that
i
would
say
yes,
to
ask
you
to
read
that
section
by
implication
of
the
act
of
1940
would
be
about
the
same.
not
--
they're
not
the
same,
it's
true,
but
--
mr.
sidney
kansas
well,
was
that
the
intention
of
the
congress
just
by
mere
application?
mr.
sidney
kansas
that's
true.
mr.
sidney
kansas
clarification.
mr.
sidney
kansas
it's
a
clarification.
mr.
sidney
kansas
well
then,
let
me
just
go
on
for
a
few
minutes
in
order
to
clarify
a
situation.
on
page
3
of
my
brief,
the
top
of
the
page,
at
the
time
of
the
discussion
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
1952
act,
it
is
my
privilege
to
have
--
had
the
number
of
discussions
with
the
late
senator
pat
mccarran
on
that
subject.
they
were
concerned
somewhat
with
the
large
number
of
suspension
cases
that
was
then
pending
as
to
how
we
are
going
to
bring
him
into
the
1952
act.
prior
to
the
1952
act,
all
suspension
cases
were
brought
under
the
1917
act,
section
19
(c)
thereof.
the
1924
act
was
known
as
the
quota
law,
restrictions
of
entering
the
united
states
according
to
quotas.
but
the
real
contents
of
our
immigration
law
is
with
the
1917
act.
now,
under
that
act,
i'm
reading
now
page
3,
on
top
of
the
page
of
my
brief,
section
19
(c),
the
immigration
act,
in
case
of
any
alien
who
is
deportable
under
any
law
of
the
united
states
and
who
has
proved
good
moral
character
for
the
preceding
five
years,
the
attorney
general
may
suspend
deportation
of
such
alien
if
he
is
not
ineligible
for
naturalization.
if
he
finds
that
such
deportation
would
result
to
serious
economic
detriment
to
a
citizen
who
is
the
spouse
or
minor
child
of
such
deportable
alien.
now,
in
order
to
carry
over
the
suspension
cases
into
the
1952
provisions,
so
that
the
benefits
of
the
1952
act
would
inure
to
the
suspension
cases
then
pending,
a
new
section
was
placed
to
the
law,
section
405
(a)
and
that's
in
the
middle
of
page
3
of
my
brief.
now,
that
section
reads,
an
application
for
suspension
of
deportation
under
section
19,
which
i
just
read,
of
the
immigration
act
of
1917
as
amended
which
is
pending
on
the
date
of
the
enactment
of
this
act,
shall
be
regarded
as
a
proceeding
within
the
meaning
of
this
subsection.
and
nothing
in
this
act
shall
be
construed
to
affect
the
validity
of
any
proceeding
which
shall
be
valid
at
the
time
that
this
act
shall
take
effect.
then
follows
the
selective
training
and
service
act
which
we
have
just
read.
now
therefore,
the
intent
of
congress
both
as
to
suspension
and
the
1940
act
may
be
included
in
that,
if
your
honor
pleases,
to
be
carried
over
under
the
1952
act,
so
that
the
suspension
cases
replaced
on
the
405,
section
405
and
section
315
clarifies
the
preceding
act
under
the
selective
training
and
service
act.
therefore,
in
this
instance,
all
that
we
are
seeking
here
is
the
--
the
proper
application
and
the
proper
interpretation
of
these
two
sections
will
give
us
the
answer.
and
as
i
repeat,
i
am
guided
in
the
interpretations
by
the
unanimous
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
of
columbia
where
they
held
and
to
refresh
the
court
memory,
i
--
may
i
read
that
again?
at
the
top
of
page
16
of
my
brief,
here's
the
interpretation
placed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
page
16,
to
debar
the
appellee
from
citizenship,
the
statute
requires
proof
not
only
that
he
applied
for
exemption
on
the
grounds
of
alienage,
but
also
that
he
was
relieved
from
serving
for
that
reason.
and
the
examiner's
legal
conclusion
that
appellee
was
relieved
from
military
service
because
of
alienage
is
not
supported
by
any
evidence
in
the
present
record.
we
think
the
total
absence
of
any
such
essential
evidence
is
a
sufficient
basis
for
affirming
the
district
court's
order
granting
naturalization.
there,
the
situation
was
the
same
as
ours.
this
alien
applied
for
relief
and
exemption.
nothing
was
done
by
the
selective
service
board
here
for
over
a
year,
so
he
applied
for
naturalization
in
the
district
court,
district
of
columbia.
and
the
district
court
granted
it
and
the
government
appealed
and
there's
a
decision
as
the
result
of
the
--
of
the
appeal.
now
in
our
case,
it's
even
stronger
than
the
one
that
i
addressed
in
the
(inaudible)
case
because
in
--
in
the
present
case,
one
of
the
bar,
he
was
actually
placed
in
class
i-a
and
ordered
to
appear
for
preinduction
and
physical
examination.
therefore,
not
being
debarred
or
relieved,
he
hasn't
offered
his
right
to
apply
for
naturalization.
now,
i
made
the
comparison
a
little
while
ago
and
your
honor
mentioned
about
naturalization
certificate
and
this
certificate.
the
filing
of
this
certificate
for
the
right
makes
some
eligible
to
file
for
a
right.
the
proper
interpretation
would
be
this
doesn't
give
him
citizenship
by
--
by
granting
this
right
of
filing
for
naturalization.
in
itself,
it
doesn't
give
him
a
--
he
has
to
first
file
his
application
for
citizenship
and
it
may
be
denied.
he
may
not
be
able
to
comply
with
the
requirements.
mr.
sidney
kansas
well,
that's
the
assumption
of
the
government.
mr.
sidney
kansas
it
is
not
a
fact,
sir,
because
they
claimed
here.
may
i
refer
you
to
the
top
of
page
5
of
my
brief
where
the
records
of
the
selective
service
system
or
of
the
national
military
establishment
shall
be
conclusive
as
to
whether
an
alien
was
relieved
or
discharged,
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
colombia
was
a
cobelligerent
or
not.
all
it
says
here
was
that
he
was
an
alien,
regardless
of
what
country
and
i
believe
that
answers
the
question.
it
so
happened
perhaps
--
mr.
sidney
kansas
yes,
that's
true.
mr.
sidney
kansas
yes,
sir.
mr.
sidney
kansas
yes.
and
that
it
also
says
--
if
i
may
read
it
again
--
mr.
sidney
kansas
but
i
--
mr.
sidney
kansas
i
should
like
--
to
the
pertinent
part.
yes,
nothing
contained
in
this
act
shall
--
all
right,
let's
read
that
one,
it's
--
it's
quite
a
lengthy
one.
and
nothing
contained
in
this
act,
unless
otherwise
specifically
provided
therein,
shall
be
construed
to
affect
the
validity
of
any,
then
it
goes
on
warrant
of
arrest,
order
of
warrant
for
deportation
proceeding
which
shall
be
valid
and
so
on.
we
--
we
got
--
we
come
down
to
where
--
mr.
sidney
kansas
yes,
which
doesn't
apply
to
--
to
us
at
all
and
that's
why
i
read
that,
of
the
part
that
you're
reading,
if
your
honor
pleases,
on
page
50
down
a
little
further,
it
says,
“or
an
application
for
suspension
of
deportation
under
section
19
of
the
immigration
act
of
1917
as
amended
which
is
pending
on
the
date
of
the
enactment
of
this
act
shall
be
regarded
as
a
proceeding
within
the
meaning
of
this
subsection.”
that's
the
--
mr.
sidney
kansas
that's
right.
mr.
sidney
kansas
that's
right.
and
they
carried
over
to
the
1952
act.
that's
just
my
point
and
the
--
the
benefits
of
the
1952
act
will
inure
to
the
cases
brought
over
under
this
section
405
(a)
and
(b)
and
it
was
clearly
the
--
the
intention
of
congress
from
the
--
from
the
act
itself
that
they
desired
to
carryover
what
was
then
pending
and
that
would
include
all
that
we
have
just
read
in
application
for
suspension
deportation,
all
the
--
the
--
otherwise
warrant
of
arrest
and
warrant
of
deportation.
we
--
we're
not
concern
with
that
in
the
present
case
though.
i
just
took
the
pertinent
part
out
of
it
and
placed
it
in
my
brief
and
that
is
why
i've
got
it
on
page
3,
section
405,
an
application
for
suspension
of
deportation.
now,
the
--
i
would
like
to
refer
to
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
sidney
kansas
i'm
sorry?
mr.
sidney
kansas
just
what
i'm
--
i'm
going
to
file
--
mr.
sidney
kansas
yes.
his
--
now,
on
page
14
of
the
respondent's
brief,
page
14,
near
the
top
of
the
page,
here's
what
it
says,
both
his
application
for
exemption
and
his
letter
--
application
for
suspension
of
deportation
were
made
before
the
enactment
of
the
1952
act.
mr.
sidney
kansas
that's
correct
and
that
of
--
then
that
was
carried
over
because
that
suspension
of
deportation
was
then
pending
amongst
the
many
cases.
they
were
concerned
with
as
to
what's
to
be
done
with
all
those
cases
pending
and
that
was
among
them
or
was
carried
over
prior
the
1952
act.
it
was
carried
over
into
the
1952
and
is
now
governed
by
it.
mr.
sidney
kansas
well
--
mr.
sidney
kansas
yes,
sir.
to
be
determined
and
processed
under
the
1952
because
they
couldn't
complete
the
processing
under
the
old
law.
it
was
out,
then
we
had
a
new
law
in
effect.
so
they
have
to
process
that
under
the
1952
act.
it
was
quite
a
lot
of
cases
pending
at
that
time.
they
couldn't
reach
and
process
them
all
before
the
enactment
of
1952
act,
so
that
--
it
is
abundant.
i'm
trying
to
cover
here
hurriedly.
i
don't
want
to
take
up
too
much
on
this.
the
fact
that
he
was
not
exempted
and
--
or
relieved
and
discharged
in
accordance
with
the
laws,
rules
and
regulations.
now,
the
cases
cited
on
my
brief
on
page
11
and
cited
also
in
the
index
of
the
respondent
here
are
all
cases
where
the
exemption
was
granted
and
he
was
relieved
and
he
was
placed
in
class
iv-c
and
therefore
the
court
have
no
other
alternative
what
they
decide
against
the
alien.
you
ask
for
a
relief
and
you've
got
it
and
that's
all
there
is
to
it.
there's
nothing
could
be
done
about
it.
but
--
and
--
and
furthermore
in
--
mr.
sidney
kansas
yes.
mr.
sidney
kansas
yes.
mr.
sidney
kansas
well
--
mr.
sidney
kansas
this
is
--
mr.
sidney
kansas
yes.
as
a
new
section
405,
it
was
made
for
that
very
purpose
and
i
again
will
read
for
clarification
the
--
of
your
honor.
an
application
for
suspension
of
--
i'm
reading
on
page
3,
the
middle
of
the
page
on
my
brief,
an
application
for
suspension
of
deportation
under
section
19
of
the
immigration
act
of
1917
as
amended
which
is
pending
on
the
date
of
the
enactment
of
this
act
shall
be
regarded
as
a
proceeding
within
the
meaning
of
this
subsection,
subsection
405,
that's
under
the
1952
act.
mr.
sidney
kansas
that's
it
--
you're
reading
from
there.
mr.
sidney
kansas
yes,
sir.
mr.
sidney
kansas
405
section
(a),
but
the
preceding
is
not
pertaining
to
criminal
status
and
so
forth
for
your
--
it's
not
going
to
do
their
problem
at
the
present
time.
the
only
thing
that's
pertinent
in
there,
it's
a
little
bit
further
down
where
it
says
an
application
for
suspension
of
deportation
under
section
19
of
the
immigration
act
in
1917
as
amended
which
is
pending
on
the
date
of
the
enactment
of
this
act.
mr.
sidney
kansas
yes,
as
a
proceeding
within
the
meaning
of
this
subsection.
well,
that's
a
proceeding,
suspension
proceeding.
what
else
were
the
names
to
be
given?
so
that
if
--
if
carried
over,
that's
--
that's
why
i
used
the
word
carried
over.
perhaps,
that
isn't
the
--
the
best
way
to
use
but
brought
over
or
taken
over
under
this
section,
so
that
we
are
governed
by
this
section
315.
now
--
now,
if
this
is
granted,
all
he
gets
here
can
derive
from
this
--
the
--
the
permissions
first
that
he
was
not
exempted.
therefore,
he
had
not
offered
his
right
to
apply
for
citizenship.
again,
i
say
it
may
be
that
eventually
it
may
be
denied
if
he
doesn't
comply
with
all
the
requirements
of
the
naturalization
law.
but
at
least,
he
is
not
ineligible
to
file
for
it
because
he
was
never
exempted.
now,
the
--
the
respondent
in
his
brief
here
while
the
court
properly
rested
it's
substantive
holding
--
i'm
reading
now
on
page
8
of
the
respondent's
brief
on
two,
where
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
the
petitioner's
complaint.
while
the
court
properly
rested
its
substantive
holding
on
the
ground
that
the
statute,
section
3
(a),
the
selective
training
and
service
act,
imposed
debarment
from
citizenship
upon
the
act
of
the
alien
and
making
application
for
exemption
regardless
of
whether
the
alien
actually
receive
relief
from
service
we
suggest
first
that
this
issue
may
not
be
reached
since
petitioner
did
actually
obtain
exemption.
there
is
no
scintilla
of
evidence
anywhere
from
the
record
that
he
--
he
obtained
exemption
quite
the
contrary.
his
application
for
exemption
was
disregarded
and
he
was
ordered
to
--
and
placed
in
class
i-a.
there's
--
there's
no
reference
to
any
record.
there's
no
citation.
this
is
simply
the
opinion
of
the
person
who
prepared
this
brief.
and
furthermore,
again
on
page
9
under
(b),
it
says,
in
any
event
petitioner
received
actual
exemption
from
this
board.
that's
not
so.
the
--
the
petitioner
takes
the
position
that
because
the
selective
training
and
service
act
or
the
selective
board
did
nothing
for
a
year
or
more
that
that
is
tantamount
to
an
exemption
in
his
brief.
now,
i
don't
know
how
he
arrives
with
that
but
that's
what
he
phases
it
out.
so
there
is
no
--
no
citation,
no
reference
to
the
record
here.
but
i
should
think
that
the
--
on
page
--
this
is
the
--
the
price
winner
as
i
call
it
on
page
17
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
of
the
brief
with
the
respondent.
now,
here's
what
he
said,
upon
the
making
of
a
proper
application,
the
relief
becomes
effective
under
the
act
or
sustained.
no
rules
or
regulations
can
prevent
and
no
further
steps
are
necessary
to
the
effectiveness
of
the
application
to
relieve
the
applicant
from
service.
now,
who
says
that?
there's
no
reference
to
the
record.
there's
no
citation
and
again
simply
the
equational
opinion
of
the
--
one
pair
of
the
brief
because
in
--
in
view
of
the
clear
statement
of
the
act
itself,
on
page
--
here,
page
3,
page
4,
page
4,
i'm
reading,
the
act
itself,
and
i'm
now
referring
to
the
selective
training
and
service
act.
in
the
manner
prescribed,
he
shall
be
relieved
from
such
liability
in
the
manner
prescribed
by
and
in
accordance
with
rules
and
regulations
prescribed
by
the
president.
and
yet,
we
have
this
here
where
it
says,
“that
no
rules
or
--
or
--
there's
no
rules
or
regulations
can
prevent
and
no
further
substance
is
necessary.”
how
can
he
make
that
statement
when
he's
got
that
thing
in
front
of
him
there?
it
just
--
it
just
doesn't
work
out.
now,
the
rules
and
regulations
referred
to
are
found
in
the
code
of
federal
regulations,
title
22,
section
622
and
623.
they
provide
the
rules.
i
have
it
here
in
front
me
on
page
18,
in
middle
of
the
page,
if
the
court
pleases.
now,
the
--
the
regulations
operated
under
the
time
the
petitioner
signed
this
form
301
established
the
specific
modus
operandi
to
affect
under
the
selective
service
law
and
then
the
exemption
from
the
military
service
because
of
alienage.
what
does
it
say?
section
622
of
--
of
32
cfr,
provided
that
an
alien
registered
of
a
neutral
country
who
files
form
301,
he
uses
the
word
neutral
here
but
i'll
try
to
explain
that
the
subsequent
reference
to
that
simply
said
alienage
and
that
answers
the
neutral
part
of
it.
mr.
sidney
kansas
no.
mr.
sidney
kansas
not
--
here's
what
--
here's
--
there's
nothing
in
the
law
that
says
that
a
--
a
status
would
change
because
its
country
became
a
belligerent.
i
couldn't
find
any
words,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
sidney
kansas
immaterial
because
the
waiting
of
--
i'm
reading
on
--
mr.
sidney
kansas
all
right.
and
--
and
--
mr.
sidney
kansas
one
--
one
more,
all
these
cases
i
started
to
say
and
i
repeat
are
those
where
exemption
has
been
granted.
and
no
reported
case
was
a
penalty
of
debarment
imposed
where
normally
for
military
service
is
granted,
not
a
single
case
and
i
haven't
found
them
under
the
respondent
brief
either.
these
all
cases
where
it
hasn't
granted
your
relief
to
set
aside
you
through,
that's
all
there
was
to
it.
but
here,
he
was
not
granted
the
exemption
and
relief.
i
guess
my
time
has
run
off.
mr.
sidney
kansas
(inaudible)
--
i
had
in
mind
the
same
with
the
chief
justice
didn't
seem
to
be
controlling
on
page
5.
just
can't
get
away
from
this
in
just
one
moment.
the
records
of
the
selective
service
system
or
of
the
national
military
establishment
shall
be
conclusive
as
to
whether
an
alien
was
relieved
or
discharged
from
such
liability
with
training
or
service
because
he
was
an
alien.
there's
no
such
record
in
their
selective
service
system
or
anywhere.
quite
the
contrary
--
mr.
sidney
kansas
part
of
the
record?
the
declaration?
mr.
sidney
kansas
i
didn't
see
the
--
the
record,
if
your
honor
pleases.
i
don't
know
just
what's
got
in
there.
mr.
sidney
kansas
it
was
a
regular
form,
it's
a
form
301
which
they
all
filled
out
and
sent
to
by
mail.
he
fills
it
out
and
he
mails
it
back.
mr.
sidney
kansas
there
it
is.
mr.
sidney
kansas
it's
--
i
believe
its
part
of
the
record,
he
has
there.
i
didn't
see
it.
mr.
sidney
kansas
i
didn't
see
it.
it
must
be
a
part
of
the
record.
i
didn't
see
that
application,
sir.
mr.
sidney
kansas
well
i
--
i
accept
his
word
for
this
(inaudible)
but
it's
all
--
this
is
a
printed
form
and
even
the
fact
that
he
expresses
that
i
hereby
realized
that
i
am
to
lose
my
--
that's
all
in
small
typed
in
form.
they
all
sign
for
that
regardless
of
whether
they
understand
--
mr.
sidney
kansas
--
the
meaning
of
it.
mr.
sidney
kansas
well,
it
has.
he
should
read
it.
i
agree
with
you
but
how
many
can
do
it
--
mr.
sidney
kansas
he
signed
it.
mr.
sidney
kansas
he
signed
it
and
he
filed
it,
but
i
know
--
mr.
sidney
kansas
record
of
the
board
but
some
human
experience,
they
don't
need
that
small
type.
i
agree
with
you.
it's
a
legal
document,
it's
true.
it
has
legal
effect.
mr.
sidney
kansas
if
he
was
placed
in
class
iv-c
and
notified,
then
it
would
be
in
accordance
of
the
rules
and
regulation
as
prescribed
by
the
president.
that's
what
we're
shouting
about
here.
but
this
--
this,
the
record
of
the
selective
service
system
has
no
such
record.
mr.
sidney
kansas
certainly,
he
is,
sir.
