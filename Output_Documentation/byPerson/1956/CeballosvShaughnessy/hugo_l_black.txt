they
say
do
not
rely

it
here
though.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
say
they
do
not
rely
on
it
here.
your
government
does
not
rely
upon
their
holding.
the
court
of
appeals,
the
attorney
general
is
a
necessary
party.
that's
what
they
state
in
their
briefs.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you've
been
--
you've
been
reading
from
the
court
opinion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
to
the
effect
that
he
is
not
deportable,
you
say
because
he
has
not
been
relieved.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
where
is
the
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
that's
where
two
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
are
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
which
one
are
you
going
to
read
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean,
which
statute
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
do
you
say
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
say
that
doesn't
apply?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you
read
it
all,
what
--
what
clause
is
there
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
you
say
that
he
did
not
sign
an
application
which
was
prescribed
by
the
rules
and
regulations?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
see
it
on
page
32.
justice
hugo
l.
black
13?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
which
one
of
those
do
you
think
governed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
--
it
doesn't
look
like
the
same
wording
to
me.
it
looked
like
it's
quite
different.
justice
hugo
l.
black
one
of
them
says
when
he
is
relieved,
that's
the
first
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
a
later
act
comes
along
and
says,
on
the
ground
that
he
was
relieved
and
he
is
or
was
relieved
or
discharged.
justice
hugo
l.
black
certainly.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
what
i
meant
was
and
i
don't
know
what
the
answer
to
it.
you
have
an
act,
in
fact,
i
guess
in
1940,
i
believe
you
said
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
which
provided
at
that
time
that
an
alien
who
applied
for
relief
would
be
ineligible
that
he
then
would
be
barred
from
citizenship
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
he
applied.
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
right,
but
then
just
wait
a
minute.
if
he
applied,
that
was
a
1940
act
and
along
comes
the
--
the
(inaudible)
act
of
1950
--
1952?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
says
that
he'd
be
debarred
if
he
is
or
was
relieved
or
discharged
from
such
training
or
service
on
such
ground.
now,
they
are
quite
different.one
is
a
--
certainly
more
hardship
to
the
alien
than
the
other.
it
may
be
that
both
are
in
effect.
certainly
they
are
--
one
of
them
--
the
president
wouldn't
--
would
allow
a
man
to
be
deported
unless
there's
harsh
or
a
much
harsher
ground.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
say
they
are
the
same,
i
don't
quite
get
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
seems
to
me
they
are
quite
different.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it's
a
question
of
which
statute
is
to
govern
or
whether
you're
going
to
apply
both
of
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
have
is
an
act
of
1940
which
permits
a
man
--
bars
a
man
from
being
eligible
for
citizenship
if
he
applies
to
be
relieved
from
army
duty.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
second
--
the
second
provides
that
he
is
to
be
debarred
from
citizenship,
not
if
he
applies
but
if
he
applies
and
is
relieved
and
discharged
from
duty.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
one
of
them
was
passed
many
years
as
to
the
other
and
i
supposed
that
whether
you
consider
a
modification
or
--
or
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
infused
together
or
something
that
--
that
you
got
to
have
some
kind
of
(voice
overlap).
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
would
suppose
that
may
be
you
are
arguing
at
some
extent
that
since
it's
pretty
harsh
on
the
--
pretty
harsh
thing
to
do
to
deport
a
man
that
since
congress,
his
last
expression
is
then
that
he
has
to
be
relieved
and
discharged,
if
that
governs.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
--
when
was
this
application
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
this
application
filed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
about
that
position,
mr.
davis?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
see
how
crucial
whether
it's
not
as
crucial.
suppose
you're
wrong
on
that
and
it
did
not
automatically
grant
any
relief.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
he
--
would
he
be
right
in
his
contention
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
he
notified
about
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
if
you
are
wrong
on
that
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
automatic?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
you're
wrong
on
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
at
two
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
or
three?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
gather
that
that
would
be
the
case
if
it's
governed
by
the
1940
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
not
if
it's
governed
by
the
1952
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
a
separate
issue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
five
years
continuous
physical
presence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
does
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
he
went
away
on
his
honeymoon.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
wouldn't
have
the
ten-year.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
doesn't
say
economic
hardship,
just
hardship?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
they
--
could
they
--
i
think
they
could
do
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
we
could
pass
on
two
things
i
suppose,
one
whether
he
was
a
citizen
and
one
whether
he
has
made
application
in
the
proper
form
that
were
prescribed
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
could
decline
to
grant
him
an
exemption
if
he
failed
to
meet
any
of
those.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
you
could
determine
that
later
without
having
the
board
determine
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
you're
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
about
the
question
as
to
whether
he
signed
and
prescribed
regulations
in
the
right
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
never
been
determined.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
the
--
the
district
court
didn't
get
to
the
issue,
didn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
this
particular
case?
