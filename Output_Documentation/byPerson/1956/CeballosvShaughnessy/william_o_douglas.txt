justice
william
o.
douglas
the
government
says
that
the
--
in
earlier
statute,
not
the
1952
statute
is
applicable.
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
difficulty
that
i
see
with
your
case
is
that
this
application
for
a
suspension
of
deportation
was
made
before
the
1952
act
came
into
effect,
is
that
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
now,
you
--
you
read
405
(a)
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
of
the
1952
act
to
us
but
you
didn't
read
it
all.
and
it
seemed
to
me
if
you
read
it
all
that
the
meaning
of
405
(a)
is
that
--
that
an
application
for
a
suspension
of
deportation
shall
be
governed
by
the
--
the
law
of
the
time
of
the
making
of
the
application
for
a
suspension.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
is
that
the
old
law
should
continue
this,
the
new
--
new
law
should
not
affect.
i'm
reading
from
405
(a)
in
the
government's
brief,
page
50
which
has
the
--
the
full
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
most
of
the
section
there.
justice
william
o.
douglas
or
to
affect
any
prosecution
suit,
action
or
proceeding.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
right.
and
you
go
back
there
and
read
about
the
--
the
--
or
to
affect
any
proceeding,
similar
criminal
(inaudible)
or
existing
at
the
time
this
act
should
take
effect.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
as
to
all
such
proceedings,
the
statutes
or
parts
of
statute
repealed
by
this
act
are,
unless
otherwise
specifically
provided
for
hearing,
hereby
continue
to
enforce
in
effect.
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
wasn't
filed
prior
to
the
1952
act.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
right,
isn't
it?
