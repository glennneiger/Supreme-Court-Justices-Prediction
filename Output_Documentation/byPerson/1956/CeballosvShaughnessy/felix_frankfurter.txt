i
understood
you
say
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
out
of
curiosity,
was
all
of
the
executive
arrangements
in
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
august
of
year?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
did
colombia
get
into
the
war?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
infer
--
am
i
right
in
inferring
of
what
you
just
said
that
the
declaring
statement
automatically
to
be
modeled
by
a
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
that
is
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
about
(inaudible)
filing,
just
tell
me
the
physical
fact
of
what
--
what
that
means.
where
--
did
he
deposit
by
mail
or
by
hand
or
by
personal
messenger
a
document
and
it
go
where?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
must've
--
somebody
must
have
sent
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
mean
--
yes,
but
he
got
the
statement
from
somebody,
didn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
got
that
request.
he
got
an
official
request
to
make
out
a
questionnaire
or
a
statement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
then
--
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
may
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
question
about
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
the
derived
problem
and
based
upon
this
statement
did
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
declaration
on
which
he
--
which
he
filed,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
do
i
infer,
again,
you
weren't
clear
about
it,
if
they
could
have
pass
this
notice,
there
would
be
no
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
mostly
if
it's
a
complicated
international
question,
the
draft
board
is
hardly
the
right
tribunal
to
pass
this
onto.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
underlying
factor
is
not
dispute,
namely,
that
he
was
a
not
citizen,
that
he
was
a
citizen
of
colombia
and
that
colombia
was
a
neutral
country.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
finding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
--
is
there
any
question
anywhere
challenging
his
entry
under
that
circular
in
which
it
says
--
which
he
claimed
the
exemption
because
he
was
an
alien?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
understand
what
--
how
did
--
there
is
no
review
or
what
should
be
reviewed
about
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
meaning
by
that,
the
board
would
have
to
determine
whether
he's
a
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you'd
have
to
--
you'd
have
also
to
impeach
his
own
declaration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
didn't
want
to
serve
and
he
says
he's
a
--
he's
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
subject
of
colombia.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
would
--
you'd
have
to
impeach
all
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
in
order
to
undermine,
you'd
have
to
impeach
it
to
say
what
is
and
what
isn't
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
that
what
he
declared
had
to
be
authenticated
by
the
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean
in
order
that
he
could
prevail,
he
would
have
to
say
that
his
own
declaration
shouldn't
be
taken
at
his
own
face
value
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
be
verified
by
the
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
got
the
citation
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
giz?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
declaration
was
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
declaration
five
of
this
--
the
app
--
this
--
this
thing
that
he
made
out
when
he
was
asked
the
question.
is
that
part
of
the
--
is
that
part
of
the
record
with
the
board?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
whether
it
is.
mr.
--
mr.
davis
tells
us
that
that
--
he
read
from
it
as
a
part
of
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
there
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
part
of
the
record
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
available
to
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
all
point
to
that,
it
has
no
significance,
the
whole
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
whether
he
should.he
didn't
sign
it,
didn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
filed
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
part
of
the
record
of
the
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
the
board
had
said,
"we
received
your
declaration."
then
it
would
have
been
a
legal
document.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
suggesting
that
it
--
that
a
document
filed
with
a
law
enforcement
agency
(inaudible)
by
declaring
as
part
of
the
record
of
that
agency.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
