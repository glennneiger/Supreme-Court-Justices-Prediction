justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
isn't
it
true
that
he
was
drafted
not
because
his
application
had
been
denied
but
because
the
status
of
colombia
had
changed
from
that
of
a
neutral
country
to
a
belligerent.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
was
a
fact,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
just
another
way
of
saying,
the
application
of
certain
application
that
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
is
your
whole
point
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
apart
from
the
--
his
alleged
disqualification
to
apply
for
discretionary
relief
was
the
--
was
he
otherwise
found
eligible
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
for
discretionary
relief?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
it
does
not
involve
the
question
of
fact.
supposing
it
develops
that
the
draft
board
between
august
of
1943
in
november,
whenever
it
was,
that
colombia
became
a
belligerent,
had
not
draft
him
because
they
didn't
need
anymore
men.
it
didn't
rely
on
this
application
at
all.
justice
john
m.
harlan
then
--
then
could
you
have
said
that
he
is
--
relinquished
him
from
the
draft
was
the
result
of
his
application?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
know,
you
--
that's
--
that's
your
last
position
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
it's
on
that
there
would
be
a
question
of
fact.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
as
to
the
first
question,
there's
been
no
review
of
that
by
the
district
court.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
find
any
indication
in
the
congressional
legislative
history
that
in
making
a
change
to
include
and
relieved
in
the
315,
the
1952
act,
that
congress
has
thought
it
was
making
any
change
or
what
the
old
1940
act
meant?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
means
that
a
man
who
files
the
application
and
then
through
some
mistake,
if
you
please,
is
drafted
notwithstanding
with
the
draft
board
and
then
who
doesn't
protest
and
goes
into
service
of
the
armed
forces
he
is
debarred
from
citizenship.
justice
john
m.
harlan
because
if
he
stated
the
original
state
of
mind?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
refer
to
those
cases
in
your
brief
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
and
placed
them
in
some
place?
justice
john
m.
harlan
thank
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
have
the
court
of
appeals?
