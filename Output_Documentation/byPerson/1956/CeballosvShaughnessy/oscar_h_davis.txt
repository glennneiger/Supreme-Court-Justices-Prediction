mr.
oscar
h.
davis
may
it
please
the
court.
on
the
issue
of
the
indispensability
of
the
attorney
general
as
stated
both
in
our
briefs
in
opposition
to
petition
for
certiorari
and
our
brief
on
the
merit,
we
do
not
support
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
that
ground.
we
think
that
that
holding
or
that
aspect
of
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
in
conflict
with
the
rationale
of
the
pedreiro
case
decided
by
this
court
about
two
years
ago.
and
so
we
do
not
support
the
--
that
aspect
of
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
as
stated
in
our
brief,
directions
have
been
given
that
this
issue,
this
defense
is
not
to
be
raised
in
any
future
case.
that
bring
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
we
would
have
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
the
court
of
appeals
rested
its
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
pardon
me?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
if
that
were
the
sole
ground,
we
would
contest
our
--
but
that
is
not
the
sole
ground.
the
court
of
appeals
put
its
determination
on
two
alternative
holdings.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
trial
court
did
not.
but
since
it's
an
issue
of
law
in
our
view
which
has
been
passed
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
which
has
been
presented
here,
we
think
that
it
is
appropriate
for
this
court
to
pass
upon
that
issue
of
law
since
the
court
of
appeals
did
pass
upon
it.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
even
though
--
well,
it's
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it's
an
issue
of
law,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
our
view.
that
is,
it
does
not
depend
upon
findings
that
would
be
made
by
the
--
by
the
trial
court.
the
issue
was
--
was
presented
to
the
trial
court
but
he
permitted
it
is
because
of
his
view
as
to
the
defensibility
of
the
attorney
general.
on
the
substantive
issue,
we
view
the
case
in
somewhat
different
light
from
petitioner.
we
think
it
has
a
relatively
narrow
compass,
indeed
quite
a
narrow
compass
as
i
would
try
to
explain.
if
the
court
would
bear
with
me
for
a
moment,
i
would
like
to
state
categorically
certain
propositions
which
i
will
try
to
develop
in
the
course
of
the
argument.
and
the
first
thing
i'd
like
to
express
is
that
this
is
not
a
naturalization
case.
this
is
a
suspension
of
deportation
case
and
the
--
and
the
importance
of
that
is
if
this
were
a
naturalization
case,
it
would
be
governed
by
the
1952
act
because
it
is
a
suspension
of
deportation
case
in
which
the
application
for
suspension
was
made
before
the
1952
act
as
i
shall
try
to
development
in
detail.
it
is
governed
by
the
prior
law.
in
other
words,
in
our
view
this
entire
case
is
governed
by
the
law
prior
to
the
1952
act.
and
if
i
can
summarize
the
opposing
positions
of
counsel
and
myself,
he
relies
almost
entirely
upon
the
wording
of
section
315
of
the
1952
act
which
we
do
not
think
is
in
the
case
at
all
and
we
rely
upon
the
wording
mainly
of
section
3
(a)
of
the
1942
act
which
we
think
is
the
controlling
statute.
the
third
statement
which
i'd
like
to
make
categorically
at
the
beginning
is
that
it
--
in
our
view
it
does
make
a
difference
that
petitioner
was
the
--
was
a
subject
or
citizen
of
a
neutral
country.
we
think
that
it's
crucial
and
colombia
was
first
neutral
and
then
became
a
cobelligerent
and
ally
of
the
united
states.
and
since
the
chief
justice
has
asked
that
question,
i
would
like
to
make
a
short
answer
by
first
pointing
out
that
under
the
selective
service
and
training
act
of
1940,
as
it
was
amended
in
--
in
december
after
pearl
harbor,
perhaps
i
should
go
back
and
say
that
when
it
was
first
enacted
in
1940,
in
october
or
september,
all
citizens
were
subject
to
the
draft
and
all
declarant
aliens,
only
declarant
aliens.
and
it
didn't
make
any
distinction.
of
course,
there
weren't
any
neutral
countries
or
we
--
since
we
weren't
in
the
war,
we
were
neutral
as
well.
and
we
didn't
make
any
distinction
between
declarant
aliens
of
any
country.
after
the
war,
shortly
after
pearl
harbor,
the
statute
was
amended
to
provide
for
the
drafting,
not
only
of
citizens,
but
of
every
other
male
person
residing
in
the
united
states
and
that
covered,
of
course,
all
aliens.
then,
the
statute
all
aliens,
neutral
or
cobelligerent,
then
the
statute
went
on
to
make
a
special
exemption
for
neutral
aliens.
it
says
that
any
citizens
who
are
subject
of
have
a
neutral
country.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
a
cobelligerent
and
the
practice
during
the
war,
and
throughout
the
war
was
to
draft
the
citizens
of
cobelligerent
countries,
allied
countries
unless
there
were
some
special
arrangements
with
the
country
by
which
the
alien
would
serve
in
the
forces
of
that
country
rather
than
in
our
country.
so
it
is
crucial
to
the
case
in
our
view
that
colombia,
the
country
of
the
nationality
of
the
petitioner
at
that
time
was
first
a
neutral
country
and
did
not
become
a
cobelligerent
until
november
26,
1943
which
was
some
three
or
four
months
after
he
had
filed
his
application
for
exemption
as
a
neutral
alien.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
all
cobelligerent
countries.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
cobelligerent.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no
--
no,
mr.
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
chief
justice,
it
was
the
practice
to
--
not
to
exempt
national
to
cobelligerent
countries
of
allies
countries
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
unless
there
was
an
arrangement
with
the
country
itself
by
which
that
particular
--
that
alien
would
serve
in
the
forces
of
that
country
in
world
war
ii
rather
than
the
forces
of
our
country.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
believe
they
were,
mr.
justice.
i
have
stated
these
issues
categorically
and
i
would
try
to
develop
them
as
i
go
along.
excuse
me.
may
i
state
a
little
more
in
detail
and
has
been
done
up
to
now
the
actual
facts
of
the
case.
a
petitioner
is
a
man
now
about
43
years
of
age,
so
in
1942,
he
was
about
25.
he
is
a
--
he
was
then
a
subject
of
colombia
in
south
america.
he
entered
the
united
states
for
permanent
residence.
there's
no
dispute
about
that
in
february
1942,
after
pearl
harbor
and
after
the
statute
had
been
amended
as
i
have
said
to
a
--
to
make
everybody
liable
for
the
draft
but
to
exempt
neutral
aliens
subject
to
proviso
about
debarment
from
citizenship.
in
may
1942,
he
registered
under
this
draft
act.
and
then
for
reasons
that
--
for
the
record
does
not
reveal,
he
was
not
troubled
by
the
draft
board,
though
he
was
a
single
man
of
about
25.
apparently
for
quite
sometime,
there
--
and
some
indication
that
were
discussions
by
him
with
the
draft
board,
but
all
we
can
say
as
a
matter
of
hard
fact
is
that
in
june
1943,
about
a
year
after
he
applied,
he
registered
under
the
draft,
he
was
given
an
alien
statement,
a
personal
statement
which
aliens
were
asked
to
fill
out.
and
in
the
course
of
that
statement,
one
of
the
questions
is,
i
do
or
i
do
not
object
to
service
in
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states
and
the
alien
was
required
to
fill
any
of
his
own
handwriting
either
the
word,
“i
do
or
i
do
not.”
this
alien
filled
in
with
his
own
handwriting,
the
word
“do”,
i
do
object
to
service
in
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states.
then,
about
two
months
later
in
august
1943,
he
filled
out
a
regular
form
which
the
selective
service
had
developed
under
this
section
3
(a)
of
the
--
of
the
1940
act
called
application
by
alien
for
relief
from
military
service.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
august
1943.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
november
26,
1943,
three
or
four
months
later.
this
--
in
august
1943,
he
filled
out
a
regular
form,
application
by
alien
from
--
for
relief
from
military
service
which
on
its
face
shows
that
it's
applicable
only
to
neutral
aliens.
and
also
on
its
face,
it
says,
"i
--
i
understand
that
the
making
of
this
application
the
relief
from
such
liability
will
debar
me
from
becoming
a
citizen
of
the
united
states."
this
application
was
signed
by
the
petitioner
in
august
1943.
i
have
here
the
immigration
file
which
was
largely
at
the
district
court,
it
is
not
part
of
the
court
record,
but
for
the
convenience
to
the
court,
i
will
leave
it
with
the
clerk
so
that
if
any
justice
wishes
to
look
at
--
at
a
photostat
of
the
actual
application
which
was
signed
by
mr.
ceballos.
that
was
in
august
1943.
now,
the
reason
this
case
is
here
is
that
for
reasons
unknown
to
us,
the
local
draft
board
did
not
then
process
the
application
in
the
way
they
were
usually
done.
that
is
they
did
not
send
him
a
card
saying
you
are
now
in
class
iv-c
which
was
the
class
for
neutral
aliens
who
are
exempted
from
the
draft
after
they
had
filed
this
application
for
relief.
they
did
not
do
that.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
regulations
required
it.
but
as
i
will
try
to
point
out
later,
the
regulations
did
not
make
it
in
our
view,
a
prerequisite
to
the
exemption
from
the
draft,
which
we
think
was
an
automatic
consequence
of
the
statute
that
there
was
no
discretion.
in
other
words,
in
the
draft
board
to
decide
whether
the
man
should
or
should
not
have
been
exempted
that
once
he
had
filed
an
application
in
proper
form
as
he
did
because
it
was
under
the
--
in
the
form
which
the
selective
service
system
had
itself
authorized
that
he
was
not
automatically
exempted
from
the
draft.
if
he
were,
in
fact,
the
citizen
of
colombia
as
to
which
there
was
dispute
then
or
now.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
this
is
part
--
that
application
became
part
of
the
selective
service
files.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
as
far
as
this
record
shows
there
was
none.
this
was
accepted.
in
fact,
it
was
sworn
to
before
the
chief
clerk
of
the
local
board
whose
signature
appears
on
it.
it
became
part
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
the
reason
the
case
is
here,
mr.
justice.
the
record
does
not
show
that
there
was
any
card
that
was
sent
to
him
and
the
record
does
not
show
that
the
local
board
on
its
roles
put
him
down
in
anything
at
the
time,
either
in
--
in
class
iv-c
or
any
other
class.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
iv-c
would
be
the
class
for
a
neutral
alien
exempt.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
--
that
is
true
and
--
and
the
reason
this
case
is
here
and
also
the
reason
why
i
say
that
it's
of
such
a
narrow
compass
is
that
at
least
under
the
record
on
which
we
are
here,
that
was
not
done.
it
was
done
in
almost
all
cases.
but
on
this
record
that
was
not
done.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
is
our
view
of
the
statute.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
is
our
position.
we
have
two
ultimate
positions,
mr.
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
all
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
sir,
for
two
reasons.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
one,
we
say
secondly,
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
so
found
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
that
even
though
the
board
did
not
send
him
a
card
or
even
though
there
is
no
record
that
even
on
the
board's
own
file,
they
made
any
notation,
he
was
in
fact
exempted
until
after
his
country
colombia
had
entered
the
war
at
the
end
of
november
and
the
local
board
had
been
informed
to
that
fact
by
the
central
office
of
the
selective
services
system.
and
--
and
the
memorandum
from
the
selective
service
system
informing
the
local
board
that
colombia
had
entered
the
war,
it
didn't
go
out
until
december
20.
it
wasn't
until
after
that
until
january
1944
that
he
was
classified
i-a.
and
so
--
so
we
say
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
was
relieved
from
service
for
the
period
at
least
from
the
period
when
it
went
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
he
was
--
he
was
--
he
was
notified
only
of
being
classified
in
i-a.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
then,
we
have
another
position
which
is
that
under
the
wording
of
the
statute,
which
we
think
is
the
controlling
statute
here
section
3
(a)
of
1940
act,
the
mere
making
of
the
application
is
sufficient
debarment.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
automatic.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
if
we're
wrong
at
all
those
three,
then
we
lose
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
first
that
the
statute
automatically
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
exempted
him
from
service.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
so
that
he
--
even
if
the
draft
board
did
nothing
or
even
if
they
gave
him
a
i-a
and
he
would
still
be
exempted
until
that
he
was
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
exempted
by
the
draft
board
because
they
did
not
call
him
for
service
until
after
his
country
had
become
a
cobelligerent.
and
three,
that
regardless
the
mere
filing
of
the
application
by
him
is
enough
to
debar
him
from
citizenship.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
as
the
record
reveals,
he
first
signed
the
statement
that
i
referred
to
before
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
no,
first
he
signed
the
statement
saying,
"i
do
object
to
service
in
the
(inaudible)
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
that
statement
--
there
were
two
documents.
the
first
document
came
from
the
draft
board
which
is
a
statement
of
alien's
personal
history
and
he
had
to
fill
it
in.
and
a
part
of
that
statement,
there
was
the
phrase,
“i
do
or
i
do
not
object.”
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
he
filled
in
“i
do.”
he
then
sent
that
back
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
he
--
he
filled
that
in
and
sent
it
back
to
the
draft
board.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
if
i
may,
that
was
far
as
we
can
tell.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
he
--
he
then
says
he
received
from
the
draft
board
by
mail
this
other
--
this
application
for
relief
from
military
service,
form
301.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
he
does
object.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
he
apparently
kept
the
--
that
form
several
days,
signed
it
and
returned
it
to
the
draft
board,
i
gather
by
mail.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
i
think
that
that
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
petitioner
has
not
made
any
point
that
if
they
had
sent
him
the
notice
that
he
would
then
have
been
relieved
from
service
and
there
would
be
no
case.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
because
the
1952
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
no,
mr.
justice.
the
1952
act
says,
application
and
discharge.
if
they
had
sent
him
the
notice,
he
would
have
been
relieved
from
service.
so
that
the
1952
act
would
have
been
fulfilled
as
well
as
the
1940
act
and
there
would
be
no
problem
either
under
the
1940
act
or
under
the
1952
act.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
first,
i'd
say
that
issue
isn't
here.
the
second
--
well,
the
reason
why
i
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
because
it
may
very
well
be
that
an
application
by
a
man
who
is
not
a
citizen
of
a
neutral
country
is
not
an
application.
in
the
kristensen
case
which
before
this
court
about
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it's
filing
of
a
proper
application
mr.
--
mr.
justice,
filing
of
a
proper
application.
now,
let
me
recall
the
kristensen
case
which
was
before
this
court
about
five
years
ago.
kristensen
was
a
man
who
was
a
temporary
resident
of
the
country.
he
was
caught
here
and
he
was
a
dane.
he
was
caught
here
by
the
--
by
the
--
or
--
i
think
norwegian
or
dane.
he
was
caught
here
by
the
war.
he
filed
an
application
and
he
then
applied
for
suspension
of
deportation
and
the
government
contended
that
he
was
ineligible
for
citizenship.
this
court
held
that
since
he
was
a
temporary
resident
and
temporary
residence
were
not
covered
by
the
draft
his
application
was
--
as
if
it
were
no
application
even
though
he
had
physically
filed.
so
it's
possible
to
hold
that
a
man
who
makes
an
application
even
though
where
he
isn't
covered
by,
that
is
where
he
can
go,
but
there's
no
proper
application
--
hasn't
made
an
application
and
therefore,
he
isn't
debarred
from
citizenship.
and
that
was
the
holding
with
relation
to
a
man
who
was
not
a
permanent
resident
in
the
mcgrath
against
kristensen
case.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
--
i
would
say
that
the
way
of
saying
it
is
that
it
must
be
an
application
which
is
a
proper
application
under
the
rules
and
regulations
that
it's
by
man
who
is
a
permanent
resident
of
the
country
and
a
subject
or
citizen
of
a
neutral
country.
and
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
filing
of
a
proper
application
that
is
by
man
who
is
really
subject
to
the
act.
if
a
man
--
if
a
citizen
of
great
britain
filed
the
application,
great
britain
not
being
a
neutral
country,
i
don't
think
that
--
that
we
would
take
the
position,
though
some
lower
courts
have.
and
i
--
i
don't
--
the
issue
isn't
here.
i
perhaps
shouldn't
preclude
the
government
because
some
lower
courts
have
taken
the
position
that
--
when
a
man
files
an
application,
perhaps
in
the
mistaken
belief
that
his
country
was
neutral
and
that
he
had
a
right
to
--
to
a
relief.
he
has
indicated
by
that
his
lack
of
concern
for
this
country.
and
--
and
therefore,
the
debarment
provision
of
the
statute
should
apply.
all
i
really
want
to
indicate
now
at
this
point
is
that
i
think
that's
a
different
distinguishable
question
which
can
be
decided
separately
if
it
ever
should
arise
before
this
court.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
that's
right,
mr.
justice.
they
ordinarily
accepted
this
unless
some
higher
authority
tell
them
otherwise.
well,
i
believe
that
i've
--
in
--
in
effect
stated
what
the
facts
were,
that
is
colombia
became
a
--
he
--
petitioner
filed
this
application
for
exemption
in
august
1943.
colombia
became
a
cobelligerent,
entered
the
war
in
november
--
november
26,
1943.
the
draft
board
were
informed
of
this
fact
at
the
end
of
december
1943
and
this
man
was
drafted
or
he
was
--
i
should
say
classified
in
--
in
i-a
in
january
1944.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
he
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
he
did.
he
--
he
--
in
january
1944,
as
i
said,
he
was
classified
i-a
but
he
was
rejected
for
physical
disability.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
he
then
received
permission
from
his
draft
board
to
leave
the
country
because
he
had
a
business
mostly
in
mexico
and
some
other
countries.
and
after
he
left
the
united
states,
apparently
very
many
times
during
that
period,
he
stayed
away
for
period
of
time.
apparently
in
1950,
he
became
a
citizen
of
mexico
having
once
been
a
citizen
of
colombia,
then
he
came
back
to
the
united
states.
and
in
january
1951,
i
believe,
married
an
american
girl.
then
shortly
thereafter,
they
went
on
--
immediately
thereafter,
they
went
on
a
honeymoon
to
paris
and
returned
to
the
united
states
in
april
1951.
she
with,
of
course,
the
right
to
enter
the
country
without
limit
because
she
was
an
american
citizen,
but
he,
only
with
a
transit
visa
for
mexico
which
was
the
country
of
his
then
nationality
and
because
they
decided
to
stay
in
this
country.
she
was
pregnant
at
the
time
and
she
wanted
to
have
her
child
in
the
united
states.
because
they
decided
to
stay
in
this
country
rather
they
continue
on
to
mexico
where
he
had
substantial
interests
and
where
he
had
a
divorced
wife
and
three
children
because
he
had
previously
--
in
mexico,
married
a
mexican
citizen
and
had
three
children
by
her
and
had
then
divorced
her
or
been
divorced
by
her,
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
which.
and
had
then
come
back
to
united
states
and
married
this
american
lady.
but
as
i
say,
they
decided
not
to
go
on
to
mexico
as
his
visa
originally
required
to
stay
in
united
states.
and
since
he
was
clearly
deportable,
the
only
way
that
he
could
prevent
his
deportation
was
to
secure
its
suspension
within
the
discretionary
relief
granted
to
the
attorney
general.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
under
the
old
act
and
that's
why
i
want
to
stress
that
because
the
provisions
for
suspension
of
deportation
under
the
pre-1952
act
are
quite
different
from
what
they
are
under
the
1952
act.
the
immigration
service
and
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
process
this
as
we
think
quite
properly
under
the
provisions
of
the
old
law.
and
that
old
law
was
much
more
favorable
to
the
alien
in
many
respects
but
it
was
unfavorable
in
one
respect
that
is
ineligibly
for
citizenship.
let
me
--
let
me
spell
that
out.
the
old
law
said
that
you
could
get
suspension
without
any
period
of
residence
in
the
united
states
if
you
merely
proved
a
good
conduct
for
five
years
and
it
didn't
require
that
you
have
been
physically
present
in
the
united
states
for
that
five-year
period.
the
new
law
requires
in
some
cases
that
you
--
and
requires
in
all
cases
that
there'd
be
a
period
of
physical
presence
in
the
united
states,
sometimes
five
years,
sometimes
10
years,
continuous
physical
presence
in
the
united
states
at
the
new
law,
sometimes
five
years,
sometimes
10
years,
which
was
not
true
under
the
old
law.
under
the
old
law,
you
could
get
--
you
are
eligible
for
suspension
if
there
were
a
serious
economic
detriment
to
your
wife
or
your
children
if
they
were
american
citizens.
under
the
new
law,
you
have
to
prove
exceptional
and
extremely
unusual
hardships.
so
that
standard
is
tougher
under
the
new
law
than
it
was
under
the
old
law.
but
there
was
one
factor
in
which
the
old
law
was
more
rigid
if
you
might
say
than
the
new
law.
the
old
law
required
that
you'll
be
eligible
for
naturalization
and
that's
why
this
issue
arises.
under
the
new
law,
you
do
not
have
to
be
proved
eligible
for
naturalization.
and
so
we
do
not
take
the
position
that
if
mr.
ceballos
applies
under
the
new
law
and
can
meet
the
other
requirements
of
residence
in
extremely
and
exceptionally
unusual
hardship
to
his
family
that
he
would
be
debarred
from
suspension
of
deportation
under
the
new
law.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
the
reason,
mr.
justice
reed,
is
that
in
the
savings
clause
of
the
1952
act
which
this
court
have
before
in
several
cases,
congress
vary
specifically
provided
that
applications
for
suspension
should
be
continued
to
be
processed
under
the
old
law
if
they
were
filed
under
the
old
law
and
that
comes
about
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
mr.
justice.
i
think
if
you
read
section
405,
the
savings
clause
which
is
in
the
government's
brief
at
page
50
and
recognizing
that
by
the
specific
statement
of
the
congress,
an
application
for
suspension
which
was
pending
on
the
date
of
the
enactment
is
a
proceeding.
you
will
see
that
it's
governed
wholly
by
the
old
law
rather
than
by
the
new.
first,
the
statute
says
that
nothing
in
the
new
act
shall
affect
the
validity
of
any
proceeding
which
was
valid
at
the
time.
then,
it
goes
on
to
say,
nor
shall
it
affect,
nothing
in
the
new
law
shall
affect
any
proceeding
about
five
lines
or
six
lines
from
--
from
the
beginning
of
section
405.
it
shall
not
affect
any
proceeding.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
prosecution,
suit,
action
or
proceeding.
it
shall
not
affect
any
proceeding
which
was
done
or
existing
at
the
time
the
1952
act
shall
take
effect.
and
then,
it
goes
on
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
and
then,
it
even
goes
more,
it
goes
on
further
and
says,
but
as
to
all
such
proceedings,
the
--
the
statutes
or
parts
of
the
statutes
repealed
by
this,
the
1952
act,
are
continued
in
--
enforced
and
in
effect.
and
we
think
that's
as
clear
as
can
be
a
statement
that
a
suspension
of
deportation
which
was
pending
at
the
time
when
the
new
act
went
into
effect
is
to
be
governed
by
the
old
law
rather
than
the
new.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
actually
know,
mr.
justice,
but
i
guess
that
it's
because
this
--
the
criteria
under
the
new
act,
they
are
so
much
more
stringent
that
the
effort
was
being
made
to
--
to
govern
the
pending
cases
under
the
--
the
more
generous
standards
of
the
old
law.
as
i
say
more
generous
except
in
relation
to
petitioner
because
the
old
law
require
this
eligibility
for
naturalization
and
the
new
law
did
not,
but
the
other
standards
are
stricter
under
the
new
law
than
they
were
under
the
old
law.
and
i
--
i
guess
that
was
the
reason
for
the
--
for
the
provision.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
with
--
be
relieved
of
the
difficulty
as
in
this
case
if
he
can
meet
the
other
difficulty
which
are
under
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
under
the
new
law.
and
in
that
connection,
i
should
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
he
has
that,
mr.
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
apparently.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but
he
came
back
in
1951.
he
came
back
in
april
1951.
but
i
--
i
should
--
at
that
point,
i'll
make
it
caveat
to
the
last
footnote
in
our
brief
at
page
47,
in
which
we
suggest
that
it
may
be
that
he
now
has
the
residence
requirements.
we
don't
know
what
happened
since
1951
but
if
you
assumed
that
he's
been
present
in
the
united
states
continuously
for
that
time
he
would
have
five
years
residence.
the
caveat
i
want
to
make
is
that
the
1952
act
as
of
that
eight
provisions
as
very
complicated
provisions
in
section
244
as
to
suspension.
and
as
to
some
of
them,
there's
five
years
residence
as
to
10th
some
--
there
is
ten-year
residence
and
we're
not
certain
whether
the
five-year
provisions
apply
to
this
petitioner
or
the
ten-year
provisions
apply
to
this.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
he
--
apparently,
he
would
not
have
the
ten-year
provision.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
he
has
to
meet
the
economic
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
or
--
or
to
himself.
it
says,
either
to
the
man
himself
or
to
his
dependents
but
it
has
to
be
exceptional
--
exceptional
and
extremely
unusual
hardship.
the
record
reveals
that
he
is
a
man
of
some
wealth
and
it
may
be
doubtful
whether
he
could
meet
that
standard.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
that's
an
issue
which
isn't
here
but
it
may
very
well
be
that
congress
didn't
mean
that
any
separation
of
an
alien
from
his
family
was
exceptional
and
extremely
unusual
hardship
because
that's
the
only
case
that
the
statute
deals
with
it
that
suspension
would
be
allowed
and
they
went
on
to
provide
that
he
has
to
show
exceptional
and
extremely
unusual
hardship.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
says
hardship.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
says
exceptional
and
extremely
unusual
hardship.
it
doesn't
say
economic
hardship.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
pardon?
excuse
me
sir?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
in
--
in
the
course
of
the
discussion,
i've
--
i've
covered
what
i
meant
to
say
to
show
how
narrow
this
case
is
that
it
--
it's
under
the
old
law
in
our
view
and
not
under
the
new
law.
it
involves
only
suspension
of
deportation
under
the
old
law
and
not
naturalization
under
the
new
law
which
would
be
governed
by
this
section
that
mr.
kansas
stressed
so
much,
section
315.
now
if
i
could,
i'd
like
to
go
on
to
try
to
show
that
under
section
3
(a)
of
the
statute,
the
--
a
neutral
alien
who
filed
this
application
was
automatically
exempted
without
any
further
requirement
of
administrative
ruling
or
determination
by
the
draft
board
without
the
necessity
of
his
receiving
a
card
such
as
most
of
us
received
in
those
days.
and
--
and
the
reason
why
we
say
that
is
because
the
terms
of
the
statute
seemed
to
apply
that.
we
printed
the
relevant
portions
on
that
in
our
brief
on
page
24
and
it
says,
“any
citizen
or
subject
to
a
neutral
country
shall
be
relieved
from
liability
if
he
has
made
application
to
be
relieved
from
such
liability
in
the
manner
prescribed
by
and
in
accordance
with
the
--
the
rules
and
regulations
prescribed
by
the
president.”
now,
the
statement
as
to
the
rules
and
regulations
prescribed
by
the
president
modifies
the
application.
there
were
rules
and
regulations
as
to
what
the
form
of
the
application
was
to
be
and
the
selective
service
system
on
delegation
with
the
president
prescribed
this
form
which
the
man
filled
out.
so
that
what
congress
said
was
that
if
a
form
was
filed
in
the
appropriate
--
appropriate
form
prescribed
by
the
president,
then
he
shall
be
relieved
from
service.
there
is
no
question
here
that
this
man
filed
the
appropriate
form.
it
was
on
the
form
prepared
by
the
selective
service
system.
and
in
our
view,
that
meant
that
he
was
automatically
thereafter
relieved
from
service.
now,
this
view
is
consistent
with
the
legislative
history
and
with
the
regulations
at
the
time
because
the
legislative
history
is
certainly
not
compelling
or
conclusive
and
may
not
even
be
fully
illuminating
but
to
all
the
references
are
to
a
man
who
makes
the
application
being
relieved.
fairly,
there
was
to
be
no
discretion
in
the
draft
board.
the
draft
board
did
not
have
the
power
to
say,
“well,
mr.
ceballos
shall
not
be
relieved
even
though
he
filed
that
application
on
this
form
and
he
is
in
fact
a
citizen
of
colombia
which
is
a
neutral
country."
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
they
could
do
that
but
there
was
no
question
that
he
was
a
citizen
of
that
--
of
that
country.
and
there
was
also
no
question
at
the
time
he
filed
it
that
colombia
was
a
neutral
country.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
that
is
right
mr.
justice.
but
our
view
is
that
if
he
met
both
of
them
as
he
did
here,
he
was
then
automatically
relieved
from
service.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
we
think
that
it's
not
a
matter
of
--
since
there
was
no
discretion
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
for
the
board
to
--
it's
a
matter
which
is
clear
from
the
application
which
he
presented
plus
the
statute
itself.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
those
--
those
are
not
in
dispute.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
there
is
no
dispute
as
to
that.
they
--
they
are
--
it's
--
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but
it's
--
but
it's
never
been
disputed.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
no
i
wouldn't
think
that
the
district
court
would
--
would
have
the
power
to
do
that.
i
would
think
it
would
be
the
immigration
service
and
the
immigration
service
did
determine
that
he
filed
this
in
proper
form,
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
so
found.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
in
this
particular
case
and
under
the
rules
which
of
course
i
need
not
call
the
court's
attention.
if
its
findings
are
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
we
think
they
are
because
they're
supported
by
the
--
by
the
form
itself
which
is
before
the
court
or
will
be
when
i
file
this,
then
--
then
its
findings
are
conclusive.
there's
a
reason
for
this
--
for
this
position
that
we
take
that
the
application,
a
proper
application
automatically
resulted
in
an
exemption.
and
--
and
the
reason
is
this,
for
the
whole
history
of
our
country,
there
has
been
a
considerable
strain
over
the
issue
of
drafting
aliens
of
neutral
powers.
it
was
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
war
of
1812
when
great
britain
insisted
on
drafting
americans
who
are
living
in
great
britain.
we
have
always
taken
the
position
that
under
international
law,
there
was
a
right
or
at
least
the
state
department
has
taken
the
position
that
there
was
a
right
in
aliens
of
neutral
powers
not
to
be
drafted
by
this
country.
and
we
have
insisted
on
that
position
in
relation
to
our
own
nationals,
our
own
citizens
when
they
were
abroad.so
that
there
is
an
entitlement
--
direct
entitlement,
not
in
matter
of
discretion,
not
a
matter
to
be
determined
by
the
administrative
agency
in
an
entitlement
of
a
man
who
is
an
alien
to
exemption
from
the
draft.
now
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
only
those
who
--
only
those
who
can
get
a
--
can
enter
the
country.
he
can't
properly
enter
the
country
because
he
is
ineligible
or
he
couldn't
under
the
old
law
because
he
is
ineligible
to
become
a
citizen.
and
therefore,
he
couldn't
--
they
would
bar
him
--
if
he
went
out
again,
they
would
bar
him
at
the
doors
saying
you're
ineligible
to
come
back
to
--
to
--
at
least
for
permanent
residence.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
he
could
comeback
if
he
--
if
he
voluntarily
departs
from
the
country
rather
than
being
deported.
he
can
comeback
for
business,
for
a
temporary
purposes.
but
as
i
was
saying,
the
--
the
whole
rationale,
the
whole
foundation
of
this
exemption
would
draw
aliens
is
in
accord
with
the
view
that
the
statute
made
it
mandatory.
it
didn't
leave
anything
to
the
discretion
of
the
local
boards.
and
particularly,
i
don't
believe
that
it
would
be
appropriate
in
view
of
this
history
for
the
local
board
to
block
or
--
or
contravene
the
policy
which
congress
enacted
into
the
statute
at
urging
of
the
state
department
and
to
a
court
with
our
long
national
history.
and
those
--
those
in
essence
are
the
reasons
why
we
think
the
statute
in
and
of
itself
granted
this
man
an
exemption,
even
though
the
draft
board
may
not
have
sent
him
the
cards
saying,
you
are
now
in
iv-c,
until
of
course,
his
own
country,
his
own
then
country,
colombia,
became
a
--
a
belligerent
power
and
entered
the
war
and
then
he
was
no
longer
entitled
to
the
exemption
which
congress
had
provided.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
we
think
the
draft
--
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
what
the
draft
board
did.
the
statute
gave
him
the
--
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
my
first
position
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
if
may
say
so.
if
the
statute
gave
him
--
if
the
statute
gave
him
the
authority
and
then
the
draft
board
had
tried
to
--
to
draft
him,
he
could
have
sought
mandamus
or
an
injunction
on
the
ground
that
he
or
he
could
have
defend
it
in
the
other
appropriate
ways
on
the
ground
that
they
had
no
right
to
that
he
was
statutorily
exempt
under
the
--
under
that
law
as
was
the
president
of
the
united
states,
the
governors
of
the
various
states,
congressman
and
so
forth
who
--
who
are
not
subject
to
the
draft.
he
was
in
the
same
sense,
exempt
from
the
draft,
and
--
and
could
not
be
--
could
not
be
called.
and
if
he
were
called
improperly,
he
would
have
been
able
to
--
we
believe,
he'll
go
to
the
courts
to
prevent
this
from
happening.
so,
our
first
position
is
that
no
matter
what
the
draft
board
did,
no
matter
what
the
draft
board
thought
or
what
it
administratively
decided,
he
received
this
exemption
as
a
matter
of
the
statute
which
congress
had
enacted
in
1940.
our
second
point
is
that
if
--
if
the
court
rejects
or
passes
the
first
point,
he
was,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
not
called
for
the
reasons
i've
given.
now,
it
could
be
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
but
it
has
been
determined
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals.
it
had
been
determined,
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
in
holding
that
the
man
was
ineligible
and
had
received
exemption
placed
its
--
its
decision
on
two
grounds.
one,
that
he
had
in
fact
had
been
exempted,
and
two
on
the
ground
that
an
application
was
enough
even
if
he
--
even
if
--
no
exemption
followed
or
no
relief
followed.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
there's
been
no
review
of
that
but
we
think
that
the
matter
is
sufficiently
clear
on
the
basis
of
this
record
that
the
court
itself
can
say
that
there
was
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
finding
of
the
board
of
immigration
appeals.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
finding
is
that
he
was
in
fact
deferred
because
he
was
the
--
a
subject
of
a
neutral
power
(inaudible)
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
no.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
for
those
--
for
those,
mr.
justice,
who
take
the
position
that
there
has
to
be
an
actual
relief
from
service
in
order
to
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
or
that
they
have
--
would
not
have
to
call
him.
and
our
position
is
that
the
board
didn't
send
him
a
piece
of
paper.
you
can
show
that
they
didn't
call
him
by
the
facts
and
that
the
fact
finder
can
infer.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
all
he
said
is
he
didn't
want
to
serve.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
and
he
--
i
claimed
exempted
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
i
don't
think
you
have
to
impeach
it,
mr.
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
that's
right,
you
have
to
say
that
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
that
--
that
he
really
didn't
want
--
he
changed
his
mind.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
that
--
that's
the
--
that's
his
position
in
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
his
position.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
because
the
board
rejected
it.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right,
that's
right.
and
that
i
believe
is
the
position
of
mr.
kansas
had
been
taking.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
attach
no
significance
in
this
case
because
that
section
in
our
view
does
not
apply
to
this
case.
that's
a
provision
of
the
new
act,
of
the
naturalization
immigrations
of
the
new
act
which
does
not
apply
to
this
case
which
has
to
be
governed
solely
by
the
provisions
of
the
prior
law
as
to
which
there
was
no
such
requirement.
if
i
were
to
discuss
this
particular
provision,
i
would
say
that
the
records
of
a
selective
service
system
do
show
that
because
the
--
do
show
that
the
alien
was
exempted
because
the
records
of
the
selective
service
system
contained
this
application
which
he
filed
and
--
and
which
was
on
filed
with
the
--
with
the
system.
i
think
the
purpose
of
congress
in
putting
this
section
in
was
to
do
away
with
certain
lower
court
cases
in
which
the
alien
had
claimed
that
he
--
he
was
put
in
class
i-a
and
the
draft
board
said,
“no,
we
put
you
in
class
iv-c.”
and
there
was
a
trial
of
the
issue
as
to
whether
the
--
they
had
put
him
in
class
iv-c
or
as
he
claimed,
they'd
put
him
in
class
i-a.
now,
i
think
the
purpose
of
congress
was
to
say
that
the
view
of
the
selective
service
system
should
prevail
and
to
dominate.
but
as
i
say
--
as
i
said
at
the
beginning
of
my
answer
to
your
question,
we
don't
think
that
section
applies
to
this
case.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
these
vary
so
far
as
the
legislative
history
on
--
on
the
new
section,
mr.
justice.
and
--
and
there's
very
little
help
one
can
get
to
the
legislative
history.
i
have
some
suggestions
i
can
make
as
to
the
reason
why
the
change
was
made.
and
the
first
thing
is
that
the
new
act
applies
to
any
alien
who
applies
or
has
applied
for
exemption.
it's
not
limited
to
neutral
aliens.
the
old
law
was
limited
to
neutral
aliens.
the
law
which
we
think
applies
here
at
section
3
(a).
the
new
law
is
broader
in
that
respect.
it
applies
to
any
alien
who
applies
and
there
are
other
categories
of
alien.
there
were
enemy
aliens
during
the
world
war
ii
and
there
were,
of
course,
cobelligerent
aliens,
citizens
of
france
or
great
britain,
allied
countries
and
that
we
think
a
very
significant
difference
for
this
reason.
during
world
war
ii,
enemy
aliens,
german
or
italian
or
japanese
citizens,
who
still
were
such,
were
not
drafted
if
they
object
the
service.
they
were
not
drafted
because
they
--
the
army
didn't
want
to
take
them
if
they
objected
the
service.
and
a
great
many
of
them
were
exempted
from
service
not
under
section
3
(a),
but
under
other
provisions
of
the
law
because
the
president
had
a
general
power
to
exempt
any
--
any
class
of
persons
that
he
wanted
to
from
--
from
the
draft.
and
enemy
aliens
were
exempted
on
--
if
they
said
they
didn't
want
to.
now,
it
may
very
well
--
then
the
purpose
of
congress
to
say
that
an
enemy
alien,
not
a
neutral,
but
an
enemy
alien
who
did
object
to
service
should
be
debarred
from
citizenship
but
to
require
in
this
case
that
he
also
to
be
relieved,
also
be
relieved
because
he
--
he
wasn't
--
he
didn't
have
a
statutory
entitlement
to
relief.
it
was
a
matter
of
discretion
with
the
president
of
the
army
not
in
selective
service
system
as
a
whole,
not
the
local
draft
board
but
the
selective
service
system.
so
that's
one
category
of
cases
not
covered
by
the
old
law
which
is
covered
by
the
new
law.
then,
there
were
other
aliens
who
might
have
been
deferred
because
the
president,
as
i
said,
had
the
general
power
to
exempt
any
classes
of
persons
that
he
wished.
i
don't
believe
that
he
used
it
during
world
war
ii
very
frequently
but
there
are
some
suggestion
that
he
may
have
as
to
a
certain
few
citizens
or
countries
but
it
was
again
a
matter
of
his
discretion
and
it
may
very
well
then
that
congress
wanted
to
cover
that
class
of
aliens
who
would
not
have
been
debarred
under
the
neutral
provisions
of
section
3
(a)
because
they
weren't
neutrals.
they
were
cobelligerent
or
--
or
somebody
else.
then,
it's
possible
also
that
this
provision
was
intended
to
cover,
to
carry
forward
the
1918
debarment.
in
world
war
i,
they
had
a
comparable
but
differently
worded
provision
and
it
may
vary
well
be
that
they
--
and
there
were
some
--
that
--
that
1918
provision
was
repealed
by
the
nationality
act
of
1940.
there
was
dispute
as
to
whether
it
continued,
nevertheless,
after
its
specific
repeal
or
may
very
well
have
been
that
congress
by
this
provision
wanted
to
cover
that
old
1918
debarment
and
there
are
other
circumstances.
but
the
main
thing
that
i
would
like
to
communicate
is
that
the
new
act
is
broader.
it
refers
to
any
alien
not
to
any
neutral
alien
and
any
alien
could
be
an
alien
who
applied
and
then
was
not
given
the
exemption
because
the
president
didn't
want
to
give
it
to
him
or
the
selective
service
system
or
the
army
wanted
to
take
him
anyway.
and
congress
may
have
thought
that
in
those
cases
as
to
whom
they
were
creating
a
debarment
from
citizenship
for
the
first
time
that
debarment
for
those
aliens
and
exist
under
the
prior
law
as
to
those
aliens
for
whom
they
were
creating
a
new
debarment
that
they
ought
to
require
and
not
only
the
--
the
application
but
an
actual
relief
because
those
aliens
didn't
have
what
i
think
this
alien
had
a
specific
statutory
entitlement.
if
i
may
interject
my
own
view,
i
--
i
think
that
the
best
reconciliation
of
section
315
which
we
think
isn't
here,
i
mean
isn't
present
in
this
case,
with
the
old
law
is
to
say
that
under
--
under
the
old
law,
there
was
an
automatic
exemption
the
min
--
the
minute
the
man
filed
the
application
in
proper
form.
there
was
an
automatic
exemption
that
would
come
under
the
new
law
because
he
would
have
filed
the
application
and
he
would
have
been
exempt
from
service
automatically
regardless
of
whether
the
draft
board
sent
him
a
card
or
not.
i
think
that's
the
best
reconciliation
of
--
of
the
statute
but
there
are
these
other
situations
which
congress
may
have
been
intending
to
cover.
i
haven't
said
too
much
except
tangentially
on
the
--
our
position
that
the
mere
application
is
enough.
that
too
follows
in
the
word
--
the
words
of
the
statute
because
as
it's
already
been
pointed
out
by
the
court,
the
proviso
of
section
3
(a),
the
very
last
part
in
the
government's
brief
at
page
48,
says
in
--
in
expressed
terms,
any
person
who
makes
such
application
shall
thereafter
be
debarred.
and
--
and
the
actual
form
signed
by
the
alien
says,
i
understand
that
in
making
this
application,
i
will
be
debarred.
it's
on
page
4
of
the
government's
brief.
i
understand
that
the
making
of
this
application
for
relief
from
such
liability
will
debar
me
from
becoming
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
and
as
i
say
this
view
is
consistent
not
only
with
the
terms
of
the
statute,
with
the
form
of
the
application
but
it's
consistent
with
everything
said
in
the
legislative
history.
as
i
said,
the
legislative
history
was
probably
not
directed
to
this
point
but
constantly
there's
reference
to
the
fact
that
any
man
who
makes
an
application
will
be
debarred.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
with
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
i
will
--
i
will
try
to
explain
why
--
why
we
think
that's
true
and
there
are
certain
qualifications
or
perhaps
i
should
state
the
qualification
first
because
it
made
such
a
man
to
draft.
there
is
a
provision
of
the
statute
relating
to
naturalization
of
persons
in
the
arm
services
which
does
away
with
--
a
lot
of
the
requirements
of
other
--
for
the
--
of
--
of
civilian
naturalization.
and
it
may
be,
it
has
been
suggested,
the
case
has
not
come
to
this
court,
it
hasn't
come
to
any
appellate
court.
it
may
be
that
that
provision
providing
for
naturalization
while
the
man
is
in
service
does
not
carry
with
--
with
it
this
debarment
provision
of
this
law.
that
is
a
man
who's
actually
drafted
may
possibly
be
able
to
secure
naturalization
under
that
special
provision
without
these
qualifications
just
as
he
can
get
naturalization
without
the
qualifications,
other
--
other
qualifications
ordinarily
applicable
to
people
who
want
to
get
--
become
american
citizens.
that's
one
answer.
the
second
and
more
broader
answer
is
that
the
history
of
this
provision,
which
first
came
into
the
law
in
1918
but
was
mooted,
discussed
in
--
in
the
civil
war
is
that
the
purpose
--
historical
purpose
is
that
a
man
who
--
who
indicates
in
times
of
strife
and
struggle
that
he
doesn't
want
to
serve
in
the
forces
--
in
the
force
of
united
states
isn't
the
kind
of
man
we
want
to
have.
it
wasn't
a
penalty
or
what
shall
i
say
an
encouragement.
it
wasn't
meant
to
say
to
the
man,
"now,
look
if
you
don't
come
into
the
army,
we
won't
let
you
become
a
citizen."
it
was
rather
an
indication
that
the
man
made
this
choice
deliberately.
these
people
--
many
of
them
did.
he
wasn't
the
kind
of
man
that
--
that
congress
wanted
to
have
as
a
citizen
and
that's
the
--
the
--
one
of
the
primary
threads
that
runs
through
the
history
of
this
--
of
--
of
this
field.
such
people
aren't
the
right
type
to
become
citizens.
and
that
--
that
interpretation
as
a
--
and
which
i
say
is
a
qualification
for
citizenship
rather
than
a
penalty
imposed
upon
the
man
is
also
consistent
with
our
international
obligations.
as
i've
said,
we
have
international
obligations
in
our
view,
under
international
law
and
some
cases
on
a
treaty
because
of
countries,
these
neutral
countries,
not
to
draft
their
citizens.
perhaps,
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
that
for
us
to
say,
we're
going
to
try
to
force
your
citizens
into
the
army
by
imposing
penalties
on
them
by
saying
if
you
don't
come
into
the
army,
you
will
not
be
debarred
from
citizenship.
it
would
certainly
not
be
inconsistent
with
that
--
with
our
position
towards
other
country
to
say,
"we
control
for
ourselves
what
kind
of
persons
we
want
to
become
nationals
of
the
united
states.
we're
not
trying
to
force
your
men
into
the
army
but
we
just
want
--
want
him
to
know
that
if
he
doesn't
go
into
the
army,
he's
not
of
the
quality
we
deemed
proper
for
american
citizenship."
in
other
words,
if
it's
construed
as
a
penalty
imposed
upon
the
man
requiring
--
trying
to
force
him
into
the
army,
in
some
degree
runs
countered
to
our
international
obligation
toward
other
countries.
if
it's
not
construed
as
a
penalty
but
is
imposing
debarment
on
the
basis
of
the
application
alone,
then
it
comes
with
the
category
of
our
own
domestic
establishment
of
qualifications
for
naturalizations.
and
in
the
same
connection,
all
the
lower
court
cases,
all
the
lower
court
cases
and
they
are
in
five
circuits,
courts
of
appeals
and
in
many
district
courts,
they
are
all
unanimous
in
holding
that
the
fact
--
that
the
mere
fact
that
a
man
was
once
exempted
and
then
has
his
exemption
taken
away
or
tries
to
remove
the
exemption
himself,
tries
to
take
back
his
form
does
not
or
--
or
shall
i
say
remove
the
debarment,
they
are
all
unanimous
in
holding
that.
the
first
circuit,
the
second
circuit,
the
third
circuit,
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
district
of
columbia
reiterated
it
as
recently
as
december
13th
last
year
that
as
to
an
alien
who
was
--
who
filed
the
form
and
was
exempted
if
he
--
if
he
thereafter,
because
his
country
becomes
a
cobelligerent
or
for
some
other
reason,
is
either
classified
in
i-a
or
--
and
subject
to
induction
or
--
or
tried
himself
to
withdraw
his
application
later,
generally,
because
he
--
he
realizes
what
he's
done
or
sometimes
because
he's
overage
then
and
the
withdrawal
of
the
application
won't
--
won't
affect
it.
frequently,
that's
--
that's
the
reason.
in
any
--
in
any
case,
the
courts
unanimous
in
holding
and
there
are
many
district
court
cases
that
as
i
say
courts
in
five
circuits
that
unanimous
in
holding
that
the
--
the
withdrawal
of
the
application
on
the
fact
that
the
man
is
later
placed
in
i-a
does
not
lift
the
bar.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
we
--
they
are
on
page
23
of
our
brief.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
and
if
i
could
add
the
latest
one
from
the
district
of
columbia,
mr.
justice,
it's
a
case
called
giz,
g-i-z.
the
three
cases,
the
first
one
which
is
giz,
g-i-z
against
brown
now.
it
was
decided
december
13th,
1956.
we
don't
--
actually
in
our
brief
it
referred
to
the
case
from
the
ninth
--
ninth
circuit.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
of
the
giz
case?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
hasn't
been
reported
yet.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
december
13th,
1956.
it's
a
turkish
name,
(inaudible)
giz,
g-i-z.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
and
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
giz,
g-i-z.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
g-i-z.
and
there
are
two
cases
from
the
ninth
circuit
which
we
don't
put
into
our
brief
in
which
this
court
denied
certiorari
on
different
points,
the
barreiro
case
and
the
bussoz
case.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
yes.
and
some
of
the
district
court
cases
are
very
much
like
this
case.
there's
a
case
involving
a
citizen
of
iran
who
filed
the
application
and
five
months
later,
iran
became
a
--
entered
the
war
and
he
was
drafted.
i
mean
he
wasn't
drafted
but
he
was
subject
to
i-a.
in
that
case,
he
was
also
just
deferred
because
of
physical
disability.
and
he
made
the
same
argument
petitioner
does.
his
case
was
different
because
he
had
received
the
--
the
card
from
the
board.
that
--
that
was
the
only
difference
in
that
case.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
barreiro,
-b-a-r-r-e-i-r-o.
unfortunately,
i
don't
have
the
citation
mr.
justice.
it
was
--
the
certiorari
was
denied,
number
382
in
the
october
term
1954.
this
point
wasn't
raised
in
this
court
but
it
was
in
the
case.
and
the
bussoz,
b-u-s-s-o-z
also
from
the
ninth
circuit,
218
f.2d
683.
and
certiorari
was
denied
in
number
93
in
the
1955
term.
