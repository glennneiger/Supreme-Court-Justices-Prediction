justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
your
--
is
your
argument
that
the
1940
act
should
be
read
as
if
there
was
in
it
the
language
on
the
1952
act
and
is
or
was
relieved
or
discharged?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
but
are
--
are
you
asking
us
to
read
the
1940
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
same
way
as
the
--
as
the
1952
statute
actually
reads,
that
is
both
application
and
relief
are
the
same.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
to
my
question,
are
you
asking
us
to
read
the
1940
statute
as
if
it
read
like
the
1952
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
you
say
carried
over,
you
mean
merely
that
it's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
ought
to
be
determined
under
the
1952
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
kansas,
may
i
ask
just
one
other
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
looking
at
page
50
also
in
the
government's
brief.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
these
things
that
it
says
shall
be
followed,
that's
gone
under
the
earlier
acts
ends
up
with,
“unless
otherwise
specifically
provided
therein
are
hereby
continued
enforce
in
effect.”
now,
what
follows
dealing
with
an
application
for
suspension
under
section
19
of
the
1917
act
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
how
do
--
how
do
you
say
that
that
now
is
broader
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
than
the
1952
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
immediately,
hasn't
it
--
doesn't
it
say
that
such
a
proceeding
is
to
be
processed
under
the
old
law
and
must
the
old
law
otherwise
specifically
provides?

isn't
what
you

the
same
thing
i'm
reading
at
page
50
of
the
government's
brief
at
the
end
of
the
fuller
section
405
(a)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

shall
be
regarded
as
a
proceeding.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
any
procedure
or
form
or
record
or
anything
else
by
which
that
was
recorded?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
meant
on
the
application,
the
local
board
office
or
anything
else.
was
there
any
kind
of
record
made
as
to

would
that

ordinarily,
did
we
all
get
cards?
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
just
curious
really
i
suppose
that
this
was
not
a
general
practice
was
it
of
all
draft
boards
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
not
to
provide
a
card?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
davis,
do
you
know
--
is
there
any
reason
why
there
was
special
reference
made
to
applications
for
suspension
of
deportation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
he
also
have
to
meet
the
economic
hardship
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
he
could
--
the
hardship
must
be
that
of
his
dependents,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
to
himself
at
most
but
not
by
his
dependents.
