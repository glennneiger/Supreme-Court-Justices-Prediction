(voice

and
then
what
happened?
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
no,
it
is
--
it
is
a
lapse,
if
you
can
call
it,
which
is
unique
to
this
case
as
far
as
we
know.
and
that
again
is
why
i
think
that
the
case
has
a
very
limited
significance
in
actual
facts
because
they're
--
we
only
know
of
--
of
--
well,
there
are
very
few
cases
in
which
this
was
an
actual
fact.
a
few
cases
arise
on
the
pleadings
and
since
neither
party
have
pleaded
that
a
form
had
been
sent,
they
have
decided
as
if
no
form
had
been
sent.
but
the
issue
--
but
the
factual
situation
is
--
is
relative
narrow
and
i
would
say
almost
unique
to
this
and
the
few
other
cases.
now,
in
--
the
present
case
arises
because
this
petitioner
came
into
this
country
in
1951,
in
april
1951
with
only
a
transit
visa.
he
had
since
become
a
citizen
of
mexico.
he
became
a
citizen
of
mexico
in
1940
and
had
married
his
american
wife.
and
as
mr.
kansas
said
yesterday,
he
was
not
given
a
permanent
entry
visa
in
april
1951.
he
was
only
given
a
temporary
transit
visa
for
i
think
21
days.
he
did
not
depart
from
mexico
as
required
by
the
visa
and
so
he
was
subject
to
deportation.
i
think
he
even
made
disclosure
of
the
--
of
that
fact
to
the
immigration
service.
and
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
law,
the
immigration
service
brought
a
deportation
proceeding
against
him
as
a
man
who
overstayed
his
temporary
visa
who
had
--
should
have
gone
to
mexico
at
the
end
of
21
days
and
did
not.
he
did
not
contest
that
he
was
deportable.
he
was
clearly
deportable
under
the
law
and
he
did
not,
in
real
fact,
contest
that
issue.
he
made
an
application
for
suspension
of
deportation
and
that
is
what
the
substance
--
summon
substance
of
the
whole
case
is.
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
clear
that
if
he
loses
this
case,
he
can
then
apply
for
a
suspension
and
to
be
relieved
with
the
difficulty
he
has
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
that's
good
to
know.
unknown
speaker
why
--
why
is
it
that
this
draft
man
can
--
can't
stay
here
permanently?
i
understand
he's
a
citizen
of
mexico
but
don't
we
allow
mexicans
and
canadians
to
come
in
here
and
stay?
unknown
speaker
it's
only
those
who
are
eligible
for
citizenship
that
can
get
permanent
residence.
unknown
speaker
but
i
didn't
get
those,
the
two
cases
that
you
mentioned.
