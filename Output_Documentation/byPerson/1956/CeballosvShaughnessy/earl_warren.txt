chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
kansas
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
does
the
--
does
the
government
still
insists
in
this
case
that
the
attorney
general
is
--
is
an
indispensable
party?
i
thought
they
waived
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
suggest
that
you
spend
most
of
your
time
on
some
other
matter
because
if
--
if
the
attorney
general
doesn't
insist
upon
it,
i
--
i
doubt
very
much
if
the
court
will.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
you
get
to
that,
mr.
kansas
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
to
the
fact
that
between
the
time
he
--
he
claimed
his
exemption
and
the
time
they
classified
him
as
--
as
iv-a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
his
--
his
country
columbia
became
a
belligerent
instead
of
a
neutral.
does
that
--
that
have
any
particular
bearing
on
the
situation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
a
difference
in
obligation
between
an
alien
of
a
neutral
country
and
an
alien
of
--
of
one
of
our
allies?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
the
act?
i
don't
know?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren

chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
mr.
--
mr.
kansas,
you
--
you
were
making
an
analogy
between
the
naturalization

particular
one.
what
does
this
statute
say
that
he
shall
be
ineligible
for
citizenship
if
he
is
granted
immunity
from
the
draft
or
does
it
say
he
shall
be
ineligible
if
he
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
request
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
the
one
--
is
that
the
one
he
functioned
under?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
how
did
that
read
at
the
time
he
made
his
application?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,

the
statute

chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren

chief
justice
earl
warren
did
this
man
make
such
an
application?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
does
the
act
say
it
must
be
granted?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,

that
section
used
in
the
same
sense

this
other
section

chief
justice
earl
warren
the
one
you
just
read
before
this.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
one
that

a
--
a

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
make
a
request
for
--
for
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
or
merely
from
the
draft
he
is
debarred.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
government
have
any
--
any
different
rights
or
--
or
does
it
say,
is
it
draftees,
rights
changed
by
reason
of
a
change
of
his
country
from
a
neutral
status
to
--
to
a
cobelligerent?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
anything
in
the
law
on
that
subject?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
consider
that
to
be
absolutely
immaterial
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
won't
take
anymore
of
your
time,
i'll
ask
counsel
for
the
government.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
about
this
case,
if
that
was
the
sole
ground
upon
which
the
--
the
court
below
denied
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
then
i
believe
relief,
wouldn't
you
have
to
go
back
to
--
to
have
that
determined?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
how
about
the
court,
the
trial
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
though
the
--
the
trial
court
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
no
evidence
in
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
made
no
findings
in
the
subject?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
i
--
i
understood
you
to
say
that
it
was
the
practice
to
--
to
summon
under
the
draft
the
nationals
of
all
neutral
countries.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
cobelligerent?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
thought
you
said
neutral.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
regulation
require
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
understand
you
say
he
went
after
--
after
this
claim
of
exemption
he
went
to
mexico
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
obtained
citizenship
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
determine
whether
he
was
or
was
not
a
citizen
of
a
neutral
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
do
you
attach
any
significance
to
this
section
(b)
of
subdivision
(b)
of
section
315
as
it
appears
on
page
5
of
the
counsel
brief,
the
part
that
he
read,
the
records
of
the
selective
service
system
or
of
the
national
military
establishment
shall
be
conclusive
as
to
whether
an
alien
was
relieved
or
discharged
from
such
liability
for
training
or
service
because
he
was
an
alien?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
that
plaintiff's
--
petitioner's
name,
gail?
gil?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
giz.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
there
any
of
those
that
i
don't
know
that
it
does
directly
on
this
but
are
there
any
of
those
cases
that
are
in
relation
to
withdrawal
during
the
war?
i
mean
would
still
ineligible
to
go
into
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
the
service
and
they'd
still
hold
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
kansas.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
understand,
mr.
kansas,
that
the
--
that
the
argument
of
mr.
davis
went
to
the
fact
that
this
subdivision
(b),
quoted
on
your
brief
at
page
5,
is
in
the
1952
act
and
it's
his
position
that
the
1952
act
does
not
apply.
and
that
this
was
not
in
the
other
--
in
the
act
under
which
he
--
his
case
is
to
be
dealt
with.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
yes,
i
remember
your
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
remember
your
argument.
