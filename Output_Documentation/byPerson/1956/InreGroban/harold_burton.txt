justice
harold
burton
and
is
it
true,
is
it
not
that
a
grand
jury
cannot
commit
anybody
to
jail
himself
that
that's
to
go
through
a
judge
or
a
jury?
justice
harold
burton
but
here,
you
have
the
particular
point,
don't
you?
there
was
an
order
of
committal
whether
he
had
actually
spent
the
time
in
jail
or
not,
is
ordered
and
committed
by
the
marshal
without
any
intervention
of
any
judicial
authority
whatsoever.
justice
harold
burton
now,
i
note
in
your
brief
that
you
say
the
question
is
the
fire
marshal's
right
to
summarily
commit
has
not
been
raised
and
therefore
has
not
been
considered
in
this
case,
i
think.
justice
harold
burton
well
then,
it
results
on
the
question
of
committal
that
the
chief
justice
just
raised.
that
has
not
been
considered
by
any
ohio
court
whatever
to
the
right
of
the
marshal
to
commit.
justice
harold
burton
yes,
that's
right.
justice
harold
burton
that's
right.
justice
harold
burton
and
therefore,
it's
not
here?
justice
harold
burton
but
the
statute
has
not
so
provided.
justice
harold
burton
but
there's
no
objection
raised
to
this
--
what
statute
did
provide
them?
justice
harold
burton
private
meant
to
it.
justice
harold
burton
mr.
counsel,
what
--
what
process
brings
the
man
before
the
fire
marshal?
justice
harold
burton
is
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
available
to
test
the
right
where
the
man
to
whom
it
relates
is
not
in
custody
of
anybody
but
is
out
on
bail?
justice
harold
burton
that's
everything
that
is
postponed
until
now.
