justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
question
here
as
to
whether
or
not
an
act
constitutional
in
providing
for
a
private
hearing
on
which
a
man
might
be
sentenced
to
contempt
and
depriving
him
of
a
lawyer
at
such
private
hearing.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
--
what
i'm
--
what
i
was
asking
was,
is
it
your
contention
that
you
do
have
here
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute
which
authorizes
the
fire
marshal
to
summon
a
man
in
and
give
private
testimony
and
exclude
counsel,
where
under
the
setup
of
the
statute,
he
can
be
sentenced
for
contempt
because
that's
deterrent
that
we
have
to
reach
the
contempt
question
to
decide
your
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
happened
to
these
men?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
--
they
were
summoned.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
record
shows
they
were
summoned.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
went
before
the
fire
marshal.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
what
did
he
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
man
--
the
--
the
fire
marshal
didn't
do
it,
you
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
--
he
took
them
down.
does
the
record
show
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
see
--
i
see
the
state's
brief
and
justly
that
they
have
presented
here.
the
appellees'
brief
says,
“however,
the
appellants
were
not
incarcerated,
but
were
released
on
bond
rather
than
incarceration."
so
that
the
very
question
here
--
presented
herein
could
be
litigated.
what
--
what
were
the
--
what
did
they
make
a
bond
to
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
stay
the
incarceration
ordered
by
the
fire
marshal?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
these
facts
before
the
supreme
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
challenge
the
--
did
you
have
a
habeas
corpus
for
the
supreme
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
understand
the
supreme
court
has
decided?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
didn't
mention
the
murchison
cases
or
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
court
approve
the
holding
of
investigation
by
the
fire
marshal
in
private
without
representation
of
counsel?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
presented,
as
you
said?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
grand
jury
has
a
number
of
men
from
all
parts
of
the
county,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
has
the
prosecuting
attorney
there
with
it,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
when
they
deliberate.
but
when
the
witness
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
now
it's
only
the
grand
jury,
the
15
men
and
that's
a
--
a
traditionally
approved
method,
getting
a
witness
there.
witness
of
grand
jury
supposed
to
be
of
his
neighbors.
have
you
--
you
know
of
any
case
that's
--
in
which
this
court
has
ever
sustained
or
any
court
in
the
country,
outside
of
the
michigan
court
has
ever
sustained
the
right
of
a
state
to
turn
over
the
investigating
process
of
crime
to
one
man
to
be
held
secretly
with
no
right
on
the
part
of
the
defense
or
the
witness
to
be
heard
it
over?
do
you
know
of
any
case
which
has
ever
sustained
that
except
the
michigan
laws
that
we
struck
down?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
struck
down
the
statutes,
didn't
we,
as
i
used
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
there
was
--
there's
a
lot
about
it.
the
fact
it
was
secret
too,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
man
was
in
there
and
had
no
way
to
take
care
of
himself
for
this
one
--
one
person.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
here,
you
have
as
you
say,
a
fire
marshal.
what's
his
duty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
investigate
crime
and
he
calls
in
that
your
law
gives
him
the
right
to
call
in
the
man
he
suspects
and
interrogate
him
secretly
with
nobody
there
and
denies
him
the
right
to
have
a
lawyer
or
any
friend
or
anybody
with
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
your
case
here,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
concede
that
that's
constitutional
and
that
--
to
do
it
that
way?
i
understood
you
to
say
a
while
ago
that
you
thought
maybe
they
could
do
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
court
know
they
were
out
on
bond?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
supreme
court
know
it
when
it
decided
to
question
who
did?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
we
have
to
assume
then
that
that's
a
proper
way
to
raise
it.
the
supreme
court
decides
the
case
(inaudible),
do
we
not?
we
couldn't
--
we
couldn't
go
back
on
what
they've
done
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
a
state
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
denied?
was
that
denied
by
the
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
have
to
go
on
the
basis,
do
we
not,
that
the
fire
marshal
had
said
there
was
a
criminal
offense
committed?
and
he
was
not
sure
that
he
stated
that
he
would
consider
the
--
the
claim
for
fire
loss
filed
by
these
people.
that's
in
the
petition.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
where
is
--
where
is
the
statement
to
that
effect?
the
petition
says
differently.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
want
to
ask
the
petition
--
this
petition
says
that
the
fire
marshal
has
said
there's
--
there's
offense
committed
and
that
he
wants
them
to
come
and
he's
going
to
make
them
testify.
and
the
part
--
the
part
of
the
thing
involved
is
the
amount
of
--
that
--
that
they
claim
for
the
fire
loss.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
set
out
that
they
are
innocent.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
alleged
that
they
were
willing
to
testify
anywhere
if
they
were
given
counsel
to
advice
them,
did
they?
i
believe
that's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
record
showed
according
to
the
opinion
that
fire
had
occurred
at
the
dresden
mills
which
is
owned
and
controlled
by
these
people,
and
that's
what
the
fire
marshal
was
investigating.
justice
hugo
l.
black
unless
needed
now
of
a
defendant
in
a
contempt
proceeding?
wasn't
he
taken
down
and
incarcerated
in
jail
as
--
because
he
is
said
to
be
guilty
of
contempt.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
suppose
he's
claiming
that
he
can't
be
put
in
jail
for
contempt
by
this
man
after
bringing
him
up
there
and
decline
--
and
getting
him
for
contempt
because
he
declined
to
testify
in
private
without
the
benefit
of
counsel.
now,
and
supposedly,
he
is
the
defendant
in
a
contempt
case.
i
don't
know
what
the
statutes
suggest
to
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you?
how
could
--
how
we
could,
in
your
judgment
reach
this
conclusion
that
you
assume?
as
i
gathered,
you
assume
that
probably
the
court
in
future
cases
might
defy
this,
your
own
statute
which
allows
a
man
to
be
tried
in
court
before
he's
committed.
i
--
i
gather
that's
what
--
why
you
cite
that
statute,
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
no
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
only
way
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
only
way
that
could
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
only
way
that
could
be
reached
would
be
in
some
way
to
vacate
this
judgment
unless
the
court
considers
the
case
on
the
basis
of
a
--
of
that
statute
in
murchison
and
oliver.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
court
faced
to
pass
on
it,
didn't
they?
your
court
passed
on
those
questions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
let's
take
it
up
and
consider,
it
didn't
held,
it
didn't
violate
the
federal
constitution,
didn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
if
he
had
not
been
committed
by
the
marshal
to
the
jail,
could
he
have
sued
out
this
writ
of
habeas
corpus?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he'd
based
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
basis
of
the
suit
is,
is
it
not
what
he
alleges
in
his
first
part
of
his
petition
that
he
has
been
--
he
is
imprisoned
and
restrained
that
in
a
legal
authority,
but
under
the
color
of
a
pretended
commitment
of
being
guilty
of
contempt
for
refusing
to
testify
before
said
officer
(inaudible)
pertaining
to
apply.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
there
is
no
question
as
to
--
but
for
the
commitment,
he
couldn't
maintain
this
suit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
in
a
--
in
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
your
statement,
the
man
alleges
that
his
illegally
restrained,
his
liberty
by
a
commitment.
he
happens
to
assert
the
wrong
reason.
assume
it's
the
wrong
reason,
would
your
court
keep
him
in
jail
or
would
they
put
the
right
reason
and
hold
that
he's
illegally
restrained?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
what
you
have
here
is
it
--
is
it
not,
a
claim,
the
illegal
restraint
of
his
liberty
because
the
commitment
which
is
wrong.
they
have
alleged
and
you
say
that's
not
a
good
ground,
maybe
there's
a
--
that
the
reason
they
say
is
a
void
commitment
is,
that
the
ground
that
you
have
been
arguing
about
not
have
been
canceled.
why
--
why
under
those
circumstances
if
you
--
isn't
a
--
isn't
it
true
that
he
has
raised
the
question
of
illegal
commitment,
even
though
he
may
have
asserted
fair
grounds
pursuant
to
this?
and
why
should
he
be
cut-off
if
at
any
time
the
question
is
raised,
the
right
ground
is
assigned
by
any
party,
if
the
right
ground
appears.
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding,
i
think
that's
usually
the
rule
as
you
say.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
whose
ever
fault
that
is,
that's
(inaudible)
i
gather
from
what
you
say
that
--
from
your
fact
that
that
wasn't
presented
doesn't
change
the
situation
if
you
say
he
raised
the
question
of
his
commitment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
--
and
i
assume
if
it
has
been
suggested
to
the
court,
it
would
have
felt
--
and
failed
to
pass
on
it
by
--
by
the
allegation
that
he
is
unlawfully
--
and
thereby
unlawful
commitment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
that
argument
has
been
made.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
between
them,
the
difference
between
an
argument
made
and
a
question
raised.
what
he
alleges
here
is
and
the
whole
basis
that
is
causing
that
--
without
breaking
evidence
is
that
he
is
illegally
restrained
of
his
liberty
by
reason
of
the
color
of
a
pretended
commitment
for
being
guilty
of
contempt.
now,
that
--
if
that
has
been
told
to
the
argument
that
you
--
you
wouldn't
have
a
word,
a
--
have
a
word
to
the
petition,
would
he,
to
get
the
supreme
court
to
pass
on
the
validity
of
his
commitment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
only
ground
they've
passed
on.
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
it
says
is
illegal
detention.
he
didn't
have
any
justice
in
the
supreme
court
to
ever
argue
this
case.
if
it
alleges
an
illegal
detention
and
--
and
there
it
is
before
the
court
and
it's
conceded
that
under
ohio
law
that
raises
the
question.
that's
sufficient
to
raise
the
question
of
whether
the
commitment
is
illegal
under
the
statute.
why
isn't
this
the
course
you
suggested?
you
hate
it
to
suggest
probably
the
right
one,
it
be
sent
back
judgment
vacated
to
let
them
pass
on
that
question
which
is
certain,
encompassed
in
the
general
statement
"illegally
restrained."
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
don't
you
answer
that
before
you
answered
justice
frankfurter?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
would
have
one
question
disposed
of
as
to
whether
or
not
the
restraint
is
illegal.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
alleged
that
it
is.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
read
the
first
--
the
closing
line
of
the
first
paragraph?
see
what
it
says.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right,
of
the
petition.
what
--
what
does
that
mean?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
referring
with
the
one
that
says,
“harry
a.
groban,
nathan
groban,
petitioners,
respectfully
represent
that
they
are
imprisoned
and
restrained
of
their
liberty
by
the
sheriff
of
franklin
county,
pursuant
to
an
order,
william
s.
peterson,
deputy
fire
marshal
of
the
state
of
ohio
without
any
legal
authority
but
under
the
color
of
a
pretended
commitment
of
being
guilty
of
contempt
for
refusing
to
testify
before
said
officer
adhere
pertaining
to
the
file.”
what
do
you
think
that
raises?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
if
they
limited
this
--
this
raising
here
by
what
they
later
say.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
understand
that
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
their
basis
appears
to
be
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
they're
illegally
restrained
because
of
a
unsound
illegal
commitment
in
the
ground
the
arguments
they
make
are
that
it's
illegal
for
one
ground
and
the
argument
seeming
of
the
court
is
that
since
it's
--
they're
--
they've
got
to
be
limited
to
that
ground
in
the
habeas
corpus
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
we
can
avoid
that
serious
constitutional
question,
following
the
long
standing
admonition
of
this
court
of
vacating
the
judgment,
sending
it
back
to
get
more
information
as
to
what
the
court
is
doing,
why
shouldn't
we
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
we
frequently
tell
people
that
we
can't
decide
questions
just
because
they
want
them
decided.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
can
struggle
to
avoid
deciding,
see
if
it's
a
constitutional
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
the
court's
opinion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
dissent
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
didn't
know
it?
[laughter]
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
a
court
--
a
court
hold
preliminary
trials
like
some
of
them
do.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
felony
cases,
do
you
have
preliminary
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
trials
before
justice
of
the
peace
and
so
forth.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
that's
public
then
he's
entitled
to
counsel.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
the
duty
of
your
state
supreme
court
if
there's
obvious
error
in
the
habeas
corpus
case
as
(inaudible)
exercise
of
the
power
which
often
it
does
not
have,
notice
it
although
it's
not
specially
raised?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
asked
you
--
they
have
asked
you
several
questions.
they've
been
asking
you
about
whether
you
would
kind
of
get
anything
except
the
ruling
on
this
point.
i
suppose
one
of
the
things
you
want
to
do
is
to
keep
your
clients
out
of
jail,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
one
of
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
--
suppose
if
the
grand
jury,
if
your
client
has
gone
before
a
grand
jury,
they
could
have
send
him
to
jail
until
they
brought
him
in
court
and
they
told
the
court
questions
that
they
were
asked
and
had
to
go
over
each
one
of
those
questions
or
they
send
him
to
jail?
justice
hugo

but
--
but
assuming
if
they
had
refused
to

have
put
him

without
taking
him
before
a
judge
and
give
him
a
public
hearing?
