mr.
graham.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
graham,
do
you
--
do
you
have
any
cases
specifically
on
the
point
that
you
raised
in
this
case,
namely
that
it
is
unconstitutional
to
require
the
attendance
and
testimony
of
a
witness
without
his
lawyer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
why
--
why
you
didn't
bring
the
question
of
commitment
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
allison.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
say
the
state
had
no
right
to
--
no
opportunity
to
answer
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
does
--
does
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
usual
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
the
usual
return.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
allison,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
you
suggest
do
you
that
the
fire
marshal
might
intend
to
follow
that
procedure
rather
than
--
than
the
summary
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
that
locking
the
barn
door
after
the
horse
is
out?
he
did
commit
this
man,
didn't
he?
this
man.
chief
justice
earl
warren
jail.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
he
committed
him,
didn't
he?
not
for
commitment
by
someone
else,
he
committed
him
himself,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
sheriff
appeared
and
--
and
orally
admitted
that
--
that
he
had
been
committed
to
him,
did
have
him
in
his
custody
and
justified.
chief
justice
earl
warren
once
they
were
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he
--
he
did
it
for
the
purpose
of
this
act,
did
he
not?
he
admitted
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
he'd
been
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
committed.
and
the
only
way
he
was
committed
was
--
was
by
this
fire
marshal
who
put
him
under
arrest
and
sent
him
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then,
what
--
what
distinction
do
you
make
between
that
in
any
ordinary
commitment
or
attempt
to
commit?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that
is
an
unusual
procedure,
in
habeas
corpus,
is
it?
that
you
submit
--
submitted
defendant
even
to
the
custody
of
the
sheriff
for
the
sole
purpose
of
--
of
a
--
of
having
really
habeas
corpus
issued?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
this
is
normal
procedure
in
that
respect.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
the
--
their
petition
as
it
appears
on
page
16
proves
--
says
that
provision
of
section
3737.13
revised
code
or
it
says,
are
not
violating
the
provisions
of
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
i
--
i
didn't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
--
oh,
this
is
the
--
oh,
i
thought
this
was
the
petition
that
i
was
reading.
where
is
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus?
chief
justice
earl
warren
point
--
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
court
--
your
supreme
court
did
treat
it
as
though
the
federal
question
was
raised,
did
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
court
passed
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
ohio,
where
you
had
notes
a
part
of
the
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
mr.
werum.
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
what
purpose?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
werum?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
it
was
made
to
prosecution
and
was
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
they're
of
the
same
thing
if
you
find
a
person
dead,
don't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
start
looking
around
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
that
the
state
could
provide
that
any
of
its
administrative
officers
or
executive
officers
could
have
the
right
to
subpoena
witnesses
and
--
and
bring
him
in,
in
private
without
--
without
the
aid
of
counsel
and
question
him
under
oath
concerning
any
matter
that
fell
within
the
purview
of
their
offices?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
you
do
think
they
could
do
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
do
you
think
that
it
could
also
provide
that
--
that
these
--
all
these
governmental
officers
could
put
people
in
jail
for
--
for
not
responding
to
their
questions?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
that
what
you
have
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
that
--
that
i
agree.
that
--
that's
true.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
one
--
one
thing
that
would
lend
weight
to
--
to
your
suggestion
as
a
possibility
is
this
--
this
fifth
head
note
on
page
11
in
which
it
says,
"the
provisions
of
the
3737.13
are
not
violative
for
the
provisions
of
due
--
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution."
and
that
--
that
section
is
the
--
is
the
one
which
says,
“investigation
by
or
under
the
direction
of
the
fire
marshal
maybe
private.
the
marshal
may
exclude
from
the
place
where
such
investigation
is
held,
all
persons
other
that
those
required
to
--
to
be
present.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
werum,
did
you
--
did
you
research
in
your
state
or
in
the
federal
system
whether
it
conform
to
due
process
for
an
administrative
officer
to
send
a
citizen
to
jail
summarily
for
contempt,
for
a
failure
to
comply
with
the
subpoena
or
to
--
to
answer
whether
any
--
any
cases
or
did
you
raise
from
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
did
research
it
though?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
i
can
understand
why.
thank
you.
mr.
graham.
mr.
graham,
would
you
mind
addressing
yourself
at
the
moment
to
the
question
that
justice
black
asked
about
the
feasibility
of
remanding
this
--
vacating
this
--
this
decision
and
remanding
it
to
the
ohio
courts
to
determine
the
other
half
of
it
that
might
not
be
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
had
a
right
to
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
graham,
did
you
argue
to
the
trial
courts
the
question
of
whether
there
--
it
was
constitutional
for
the
fire
marshal
to
commit
your
client
for
this
purpose?
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
deny
that
at
all?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
did
you
say
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
was
in
jail,
why
did
you
want
to
get
him
out?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
didn't
you
argue
that
was
illegal
for
him
to
have
(voice
overlap).
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
should
have
said
so.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
