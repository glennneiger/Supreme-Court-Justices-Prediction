justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
my
mind
has
understood
you
suggested
is
that
your
essential
claim
maybe
sustained
by
your
own
supreme
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
not
sustain
the
thing
that
worries
this
court
and
does
it
(inaudible)
to
the
decision
in
legislative
power.
all
we
know
is,
we
hope
that
they
would.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
you
are
raising
your
--
an
antecedent
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
but
despite
of
the
oliver
and
murchison
case,
offered
that
the
purchase
question
has
not
been
denied
to
you
by
ohio.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
this
instance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
say
yes
to
the
question
of
whether
he
could
be
committed
for
contempt?
is
that
the
essence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
included
i
assume?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
the
power
of
contempt
means
that
at
the
end
of
the
process
of
inquiry
to
the
constitution,
proceeding
in
contempt,
a
man
may
go
to
jail.
now,
is
that
in
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
--
does
the
power
to
summon
and
to
--
to
swear
without
dependance
of
a
counsel?
does
that
carry
with
it
even
to
--
either
inherently
or
by
virtue
of
the
statute
that
must
come
into
play
that
he
--
they
may
then
decide
that
he's
guilty
of
pretending
to
subpoena.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
--
suppose
the
statute
said,
“we
hereby
authorize
that
what
it
amounts
to
--
to
summoning
the
witness
to
swearing
hearing
and
that's
all.”
and
it's
going
to
be
the
only
powers
that
quite
amount
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
what
would
you
say
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
he
may
bring
him
in.
justice
felix
frankfurter
bring
him
in
for
--
for
a
hearing
and
all
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
hearing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
no
more.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
asking
--
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
he
could
give
--
well,
commit
him.
you
got
to
be
careful
about
that.
is
there
a
power
of
commitment,
commitment
here
for
a
failure
to
testify?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
--
suppose
the
ohio
constitution
which
certainly
in
1912,
you
reduce
the
number
of
novel
teachers,
that's
in
the
amendment.
suppose
the
ohio
constitution,
1912
had
a
provision
that
--
retaining
the
grand
--
grand
jury
as
the
agency
for
ascertaining
as
the
crime-charging
body
for
the
state,
accepting
only
as
to
alleged
commission
of
arson
and
had
vested
that
inquiring
power
in
a
--
in
a
single
inquiring
body
to
do
it,
fires.
would
that
be
unconstitutional?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
suppose
they
meant
the
fire
marshal,
the
grand
jury
on
--
of
the
crime-charging
body
as
an
ordinary
late
grand
jury
is
about
all.
would
that
be
unconstitutional?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
court
(voice
overlap)
that
this
is
a
sort
of
a
preliminary
investigation
so
that
on
the
basis
of
what
he
finds
represents
the
--
the
prosecuting
attorney
may
--
then
they
have
it
before
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
grand
jury,
they
embody
in
its
belief
the
very
purposes
that
it
should
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
sure
that's
--
whatever
they
are,
21
or
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
that's
the
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
that
the
state
chose
to
have
a
single
person
to
be
the
inquiring
body,
the
requiring
instrument
of
the
state
for
determining
whether
a
charge
for
a
subsequent,
duly
protected
safeguard
as
public
trials
as
you
have.
would
that
be
unconstitutional?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
is
that
before
your
grand
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
--
that
was
brought
up
to
a
grand
jury
proceeding
which
practically
never
itself
have
the
other
evidence,
the
grand
jury
minutes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
they
are
constitutionally
and
necessarily
had
been
excluded
by
grand
jury,
if
--
if
you
want
to
hear
this
witness
alone.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
describes
on
the
existence
of
the
grand
jury
in
michigan.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
merely
suggesting
that
we
have
not
struck
down
the
one-man
grand
jury
officially.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
not
you
but
you're
using
it.
you
could
say
that
--
speaking
of
contending
to
the
opposite
of
what
you're
contending.
i
understand
your
position.
you
had
to
correct
me
that
we
have
not
struck
down
the
one-man
grand
jury
in
michigan
as
such.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
struck
down
a
commitment
under
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
very
different
story.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
state
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
say
that
the
outset
--
did
i
hear
correctly
at
the
outset
of
your
argument,
mr.
allison,
that
the
record
does
not
show
that
this
is
a
witness
under
any
charge
of
crime
or
this
is
a
witness
against
whom
--
i
don't
think
they
call
it
suspension,
and
was
believed
to
be
the
--
the
committed
crime?
did
i
hear
you
say
something
like
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
record
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
record
clear
that
this
was
not
a
hearing
with
a
view
of
ascertaining
who
was
guilty
of
--
of
acknowledged
crime?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
does
the
record
show
on
this
question?
there's
no
--
there's
no
crime
that's
been
committed
here,
is
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
was
there
any
--
was
there
anything
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
answer
to
this
that
has
developed
of
the
petition
or
whatever
the
pleading
was?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
well,
was
there
--
speaking
answer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
the
order
of
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
before
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
--
but
if
he
is
right
in
this
claim,
then
he
can
be
resist
being
sworn,
if
his
claim
is
that
as
soon
as
he
gets
inside
the
room
where
the
fire
marshal
insists,
he
has
the
right
to
be
attended
by
counsel
and
if
the
statute
denies
him
of
that
right,
then
it
isn't
premature
for
him
to
raise
the
questions
that
one
raised
that
you
properly
indicated.
i
don't
think
that
referred
to
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that's
the
substantive
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
you
were
addressing
to
yourself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
suggesting
my
--
suggesting
that
his
claim
is
a
challenge
to
that
proposition.
he
says,
“he
has
the
right
to
be
attended
by
counsel."
now,
he
has
--
if
that's
right
--
in
support
of
that
right
or
the
--
the
question,
the
presentation
of
that
right.
i
do
not
think
in
behalf
by
saying
it's
prematurely
raised.
the
police
says
that's
a
threshold.
i
can
keep
my
mouth
shut.
i
don't
have
to
submit
to
an
oath.
i
don't
have
to
--
i
can
stand
mute.
suppose
i
haven't
got
a
lawyer.
and
so,
he
is
making
it
not
premature.
justice
felix
frankfurter
another
question
is
you
say
you
denied
it,
so
that's
violative
of
due
process
to
deny
that
right,
but
he
claimed
it.
he
hasn't
raised
it
premature.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
supreme
court
did
pass
on
the
predicament
that
says
it
was
valid
because
the
claim
which
they
did
raise,
namely,
that
he's
entitled
to
come
into
the
field
marshal
--
the
field
marshal
(inaudible)
the
fire
marshal,
the
defendant,
with
a
lawyer
was
an
invalid
claim.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
there
any
other
ground
under
the
record
in
that
that
he
can
object
to?
is
there
anything
else
in
the
record
that
said
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
he
said,
“the
ohio
statute
is
unconstitutional
because
it
gives
power
for
the
fire
marshal
to
call
him
in
and
ask
questions
although
he
can't
produce
lawyers.”
is
there
anything
else
in
this
record
in
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
why
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
illegal
as
to
say
a
restraint
is
illegal
doesn't
thereby
allow
habeas
corpus
to
be
sustained.
there
must
be
some
basis
for
you
to
reach
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
fact
that
he
had
to
give
a
bond
doesn't
make
it
legal.
it's
illegal
if
he
exact
into
the
bond,
which
is
the
substitute
if
the
surety
for
the
commitment
is
illegal.
and
if
the
--
if
the
illegality
ground
and
if
there's
anything
else
between
these
--
these
two
grounds
covered
except
that
it's
illegal
because
they
weren't
allowed
to
have
a
lawyer.
what
else
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
what
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
means
that
he
--
he's
illegally
detained,
but
the
man
doesn't
file
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
on
a
legally
detained
period
(inaudible).
there
must
be
some
basis
for
the
charge
of
illegal
detention.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
they
need
to
be
limited
to
any
label
they
have
to
fix,
but
they
are
limited
to
what
they
seek
for.
and
what
they
said
forth
is
that
the
statute
of
ohio
is
unconstitutional.
i
can
understand
the
argument.
the
--
the
ohio
statute
is
unconstitutional
because
a
single
official,
a
fire
marshal
or
anybody
else
can't
hold
a
hearing
in
private
and
examine
the
citizen
of
ohio
or
any
citizen
without
having
a
lawyer.
and
that's
why
it's
illegal,
not
that
it's
illegal
as
up
in
the
blue
skies.
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
to
the
part
of
bringing
new
law
--
interaction
by
the
fire
marshal
of
ohio?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
fire
marshal
a
candidate
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
he
concurred,
but
he
didn't
rule
to
this
court
that
you
can
quote
anything
that's
written
by
and
under
the
court
or
just
speaks
to
the
court,
as
of
--
i
think
it
were.
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
you
do
that
if
one
of
your
clients
is
a
witness
before
a
grand
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
a
party.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
say
a
party.
i
said
a
witness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
not
answer
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
upon
a
claim
of
a
privilege.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
not
answer
them
on
a
claim
of
privilege.
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
that
point,
the
problem
in
the
oliver
case
arises.
you
then
go
before
a
judge
and
raise
the
oliver
and
murchison
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
issue
that
you
raised
at
the
very
beginning,
as
i
conceive
it
properly,
because
the
issue
being
what
it
is,
the
issue
you
raised
is
that
i
want
my
client
to
have
the
benefit
of
my
presence.
but
that
was
not
the
oliver
issue
and
that
was
not
the
murchison
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
the
question
of
raising,
it's
the
substance
of
what
the
claim
was?
isn't
not
--
it
isn't
--
it
isn't
there
whether
it
was
raised
in
the
beginning
or
in
the
middle
or
at
the
end,
but
what
was
complained
of.
the
murchison
--
the
oliver
and
murchison
problem
was
--
was
a
totally
different
one
from
this
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
your
client
--
suppose
--
mr.
graham,
if
you
don't
mind,
having
been
duly
advised
by
you,
just
as
witnesses
are
advised
to
go
before
the
grand
jury
without
having
the
lawyer
present.
suppose
your
client
having
been
advised
by
you,
suggests
that
he
come
within
anytime
of
reasonable
line,
trudging
something
that
you
think
enter
upon
the
domain
or
privilege
of
self-domination,
he
says,
i
refuse
to
answer.
i
refuse
to
answer.
well,
(inaudible)
and
the
fire
marshal
doesn't
even
got
there
with
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
doesn't
at
all
(inaudible)
and
your
client
(inaudible)
to
answer
his
ground
and
he's
committed.
are
you
suggesting
to
me
that
you
can
be
powerless
to
do
anything
about
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
agree
with
you.
and
if
he
abuses
his
power
or
exercise
this
power
he
hasn't
got,
you'd
get
your
relief
by
coming
before
a
court
and
saying,
“this
man
can
in
secret
do
what
was
sought
be
done
in
the
oliver
case.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
right.
and
that
--
they
are
not
--
i'm
not
willing
to
pass
on
your
substantive
issue,
namely,
whether
the
ohio
statute
on
its
face
is
unconstitutional
in
that
it
concurred
power
upon
the
field
--
insofar
as
the
field
marshal
is
the
only
one
that
might
be
in
companion,
the
fire
marshall.
the
fire
marshall
cannot
be
authorized
to
hear
a
witness
without
an
attending
counsel.
that
is
the
substantive
issue
which
you
contend
to
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
has
been
wrongfully
committed
if
that's
an
unconstitutional
exercise
the
power
by
ohio.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
