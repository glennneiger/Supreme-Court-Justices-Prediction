you
have
grand
juries
in
ohio.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
allow
witnesses
before
the
grand
jury
to
be
represented
by
counsel?
justice
john
m.
harlan
section
.99
is
not
involved
in
your
appeal
here.
you're
not
attacking
that
statute.
justice
john
m.
harlan
no
--
(voice
overlap)
no,
i'm
talking
about
.99
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
not
here.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
if
your
ohio
supreme
court
had
been
faced
with
.99
and
it
said,
"well,
under
murchison,
of
course
there
can't
be
a
secret
hearing."
would
you
have
any
case
left
here?
justice
john
m.
harlan
then
how
can
we
deal
with
that
if
your
court
hasn't
passed
on
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
why
should
assume
that
they're
going
to
violently
construe
that
statute
to
find
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
statement
indicates
to
me
at
least
pretty
clearly
that
the
real
essence
of
your
grievance
here
is
not
the
commitment,
not
the
murchison
case,
but
the
question
of
whether
the
fire
marshal
can
get
testimony
without
counsel
being
present.
that's
the
real
guts
of
your
case,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
your
own
statement
was
that
in
order
to
test
this,
you
arranged
with
the
attorney
general
to
have
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction
obtainable
by
arranging
this
consent
commitment,
so
to
speak.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
not
criticizing
you.
what
i
am
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
suggesting
is
that
the
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
would
be
or
justice
black's
suggestion
that
if
we
vacated
to
remand
would
be
from
your
point
of
view,
vacating
and
remanding
to
have
a
question
in
which
you're
really
not
interested
decided
and
that's
why
you
don't
want
to
remand
it,
isn't
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
let
me
put
this
question
to
you.
assuming
that
this
court
decided
that
on
the
question
that
you
raised
here,
there's
no
constitutional
point
raised.
would
you
be
interested
in
having
anything
else
decided
in
this
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
but
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
no.
but
obviously,
if
this
court
should
decide
on
the
question
that
is
here,
that
there
was
no
constitutional
problem
presented,
namely,
that
ohio
had
the
fire
marshal
had
the
right
to
compel
testimony
without
counsel,
your
man
would
simply
go
back
and
answer
the
questions
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
matter.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
he
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
any
counsel
at
all
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
on
that
basis.
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
he's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
to
be
guilty,
he
commits
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
he
commits
it,
then
what
do
you
do?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
what
would
be
the
point
of
going
through
that
(inaudible)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
exactly.
