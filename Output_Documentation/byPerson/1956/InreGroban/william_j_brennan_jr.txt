justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
graham,
will
you
enlighten
me?
do
i
understand
then
that
there's
no
question
here
either
as
to
the
constitutionality
generally
of
the
ohio
statute
or
all
the
procedure
there
under
but
the
single
question,
whether
that
some
constitutional
right
is
denied
and
not
being
permitted
to
have
at
the
hearing
before
the
fire
marshal
council?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
that
an
answer
to
me
then
that,
yes,
the
only
question
here
is
whether
or
not
exclusion
of
counsel
deprived
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
allison,
did
i
understand
you
to
say
and
suggest
earlier
that
something
should
be
postponed
here
pending
a
determination
on
the
merits?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
record
here
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
record
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
record
will
show,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
only
thing
that's
in
the
record,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
it
--
does
that
raise
a
federal
question
under
your
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
habeas
corpus
petition?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
i'm
saying
is
there
any
allegation
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
as
to
a
violation
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
