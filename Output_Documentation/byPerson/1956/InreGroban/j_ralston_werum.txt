mr.
j.
ralston
werum
if
the
court
the
please.
for
the
purposes
of
this
phase
of
the
argument,
i
shall
assume
that
this
court
has
taken
jurisdiction
of
the
problem
that
has
been
raised,
actually,
all
the
way
through
and
the
only
problem
and
that
is.
do
these
people
have
a
right
to
have
counsel
present
at
the
time
that
they
are
before
an
administrative
body
or
at
the
time
that
they
are
to
be
sworn?
i
too
have
been
over
all
the
cases
and
find
that
there
are
very
few.
in
fact,
i
found
none
that
would
say
that
a
witness
as
such
is
entitled
to
counsel.
there's
no
question
as
to
an
accused,
but
you
must
remember
that
if
the
stage
of
the
proceeding
that
this
person
was
subpoenaed,
it
was
merely
a
preliminary
inquiry,
an
inquiry
by
an
administrative
body.
that
person,
the
fire
marshal
was
there
to
investigate.
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
for
the
purpose
--
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
as
he
is
required
under
statute
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
fire
was
accidental
in
origin
or
incendiary.
and
if
so,
if
there
was
a
cause,
perhaps
from
that,
he
can
determine
who
might
be
one
to
be
charged
with
it.
in
which
events,
that
information
is
directed
under
the
statute
to
be
turned
over
to
the
prosecuting
attorney
for
a
submission
to
the
grand
jury.
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
it
could
be,
but
at
that
time
and
there
is
nowhere
except
in
the
charge
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
the
petition
of
writ
of
habeas
corpus
filed
by
the
defendants
as
they're
nowhere
do
we
know
what
the
final
outcome
would
be
of
this
administrative
hearing.
it
might
have
been
a
charge.
it
might
have
been
the
causing
the
arrest
of
these
defendants.
it
might
have
been
that
the
fire
was
found
to
be
of
accidental
origin.
in
which
case,
there
would
be
no
criminal
charges
at
all
growing
out
of
it.
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
and
it
would
be
somewhat
--
in
that
case,
be
somewhat
similar
to
what
we
call
in
ohio,
the
"coroner's
inquiry,"
in
which
he
investigates
in
the
beginning
as
--
in
effect
an
administrative
body
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
suspicious
death
was
in
fact
a
one
which
bears
further
investigation
from
a
criminal
standpoint.
in
my
research,
i
did
discover
what
i
consider
a
case
not
on
all
fours
with
this
fact
pattern
on
one
of
which
is
similar
and
that
was
decided
by
the
seventh
circuit
court.
and
then,
it
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
that
is
bowles
versus
baer.
in
that
case,
it
arose
under
the
price
or
rather
the
emergency
price
control
act
of
1942
and
that
then
a
price
administrator
had
a
right
for
investigation.
and
that
investigation
could
also
be
private
and
that
the
--
a
hearing
called
by
--
or
rather
i
should
say
the
investigation
called
by
the
price
administrator,
mr.
bowles.
the
witnesses
showed
up
with
their
attorneys
and
the
question
was
then
raised
and
fought
through
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
seventh
circuit
and
that's
recorded
in
142
as
noted
in
our
federal
second,
as
noted
in
our
brief.
and
there,
the
court
said
and
made
a
--
to
me,
which
i
believe
is
the
distinction
which
i
should
like
to
urge
upon
this
court,
that
there
is
a
difference
between
a
hearing
and
an
administrative
inquiry
or
a
preliminary
inquiry.
that
under
due
process
of
law
where
there
is
a
hearing
involved
which
normally
would
end
up
and
that
a
person
might,
as
the
end
result
of
that
hearing,
lose
property,
his
person,
liberty.
he
is
entitled
to
the
safeguards
that
are
provided
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
he
is
entitled
to
have
his
counsel.
but
at
a
preliminary
inquiry
in
which
there
is
no
deprivation
of
those
rights,
in
which
there
is
an
administrative
body
that
then
he
is
not
entitled
to
have
counsel
with
him.
nowhere
have
i
found
anywhere,
any
case,
any
time
that
says
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires
and
you
must
have
a
--
a
counsel
with
the
person
if
he
so
desires
it
when
he
is
being
sworn
as
a
witness.
i
haven't
found
a
case
anywhere
on
that
point.
but
i
did
find
as
one
federal
case
in
which
interpreting
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution,
it
said
that,
“since
a
preliminary
hearing
is
an
investigative
thing
in
which
he
will
have
his
day
in
court
at
a
later
time
before
that
body
if
it
is
so
deemed
by
the
legislature
in
giving
that
power
to
the
administrative
official,
it
can't
be
secret,
counsel
can
be
excluded.”
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
i
think
that
the
power
is
there
for
the
legislature
to
give
it
to
a
--
to
the
any
administrative
official.
i
doubt
the
wisdom
of
giving
that
power
but
--
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
i
do
you
think
they
have
the
power
so
long
as
a
person
from
that
hearing,
it
isn't
the
form
of
administrative
inquiry
as
to
determine
facts
that
upon
which
might
be
based
in
the
criminal
action
in
the
future
time.
now,
in
this
case,
to
me
is
the
perfect
example
of
it
if
the
fire
marshal
through
this
hearing
determines
first
that
there
has
been
a
--
the
crime
of
arson.
and
secondly,
that
this
person
looks
like
they
might
have
done
it
to
bring
that
to
the
attention
of
the
prosecutor
or
to
a
charge
in
an
affidavit
and
bring
it
through
to
the
grand
jury
and
there
you
have
your
normal
course
of
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
my
personal
opinion,
your
honor
is
--
is
to
the
extent,
based
upon
the
oliver
case
that
--
that
undoubtedly
would
be
held
by
this
court
to
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
you
do,
for
the
simple
reason
and
i
don't
think
that
the
ohio
courts
have
passed
on
this
because
it
was
never
raised
until
this
court.
and
that
this
--
this
defendant
here
based
upon
what
he
has
said
the
case
was
at
all
times
has
been
a
--
a
fact
that
it
was
the
right
to
have
counsel
and
not
the
right
of
the
direct
commitment.
that
has
never
been
raised
--
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
--
all
the
way
up
the
line.
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
and
therefore,
if
that
is
now
the
question
then
perhaps
the
thing
to
do,
although
i
hate
to
say
it,
is
to
go
back
down
and
start
up
all
over
again
and
give
the
state
courts
a
chance
to
pass
on
this
based
upon
the
pronouncements
of
this
court.
but
on
the
question
that
is
before
this
court
if
you
take
jurisdiction,
that
question,
i
think,
should
be
answered
also
because
this
court
has
never
passed
on
it.
and
that
is
the
right
of
a
witness
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
have
counsel
before
an
administrative
body
hearing
and
not
one
in
which
it
might
subject
to
a
action
in
which
he
could
be
end
up
in
jail.
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
and
that
is
the
sole
question
that
was
before
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
in
fact,
it
was
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
while
i
was
not
present
at
either
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
hearing
before
the
late
judge
clifford
of
the
common
pleas
bench,
i
believe
that
was
the
sole
question
argued
there
was,
can
i
take
a
counsel
into
this
hearing
with
me?
and
that's
all
that's
been
passed
upon
all
the
way
up
in
the
line.
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
and
even
in
that
event,
i
think
they
were
premature
in
that
question
because
he
hadn't
even
been
sworn
yet.
and
i
cannot
point
a
single
case
anywhere
at
any
time
that
says
that
you
have
a
right
to
have
a
counsel
with
you
to
be
sworn,
although
--
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
well,
perhaps
not.
i
still
tend
to
disagree
with
you
that
i
--
that
it
would
seem
to
me
that
nowhere
as
anyways,
anytime
whether
be
behind
closed
doors
or
ahead
of
things
or
ahead
of
time
in
the
open
court
or
right
to
have
counsel
stand
up
with
you.
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
that's
right.
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
and
i
--
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
perhaps
so.
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
we,
in
our
research,
of
course
went
into
something
that
it
might
be
akin
to
this
problem
since
the
only
case
that
we
did
find
in
point
was
right
--
was
the
one
which
i
heretofore
mentioned
and
tried
to
compare
it
to
the
grand
jury.
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
no,
sir.
i
don't
see
how
he
could
--
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
--
would
not
have
been
under
restraint.
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
there
is
no
question
about
it
that
this
man
is
in
the
custody,
technical
custody
of
the
sheriff.
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
i
should
hope
they
should
do
the
latter,
sir.
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
of
course,
in
respect
to
your
honor,
the
--
quite
often,
courts
overlook
sometimes
obvious
things,
both
with
the
agreements
of
the
parties
that
they
overlook
it
in
order
to
test
out
an
issue.
and
as
the
--
as
the
facts
were
stated
to
you
here
by
mr.
graham
in
his
opening
statement,
originally,
this
was
to
start
out
at
the
level
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
but
due
to
an
apparent
administrative
conflict,
the
commitment
was
turned
earlier.
and
the
--
so,
they
started
to
take
the
long
path
through
to
the
--
by
the
common
pleas
court
and
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
ohio.
at
all
times
and
at
all
points
along
this,
the
only
arguments
that
were
presented
by
either
side
were
always
directed
to
the
point
that
is
before
this
court
today.
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
yes,
but
--
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
i
--
i
agree
that
if
that
have
been
raised
--
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
that's
right,
sir.
i
think
--
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
the
supreme
court
of
ohio?
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
that's
correct.
he
could
have
--
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
that
is
correct
and
that's
the
grounds
--
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
that
is
--
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
no,
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
well,
i
would
like
to
--
i
think
i
can
answer
you,
sir.
that
is
you
very
well
put
it,
if
we
go
back
down,
no
matter
whether
you
send
it
back
down
or
whether
you
pass
on
it
as
an
illegal
commitment
the
alternative
is
right
there.
it
is
a
misdemeanor
to
refuse
to
--
to
testify
and
we're
right
back
all
the
way
up
here
again.
i
presume
they
will
take
the
same
position
that
they
once
--
won't
been
sworn
in
unless
they
can
have
their
counsel
present.
and
we
will
be
right
back
up
here
two
years
from
now
or
how
long
it
takes
to
come
back
up.
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
well,
that
is
true.
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
that
is
correct
and
that
is
--
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
of
the
petition,
your
honor?
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
that
is
prior
the
petition
i
think
you're
referring
to
which
--
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
i
think
it
raises
the
point
that
they
have
gone
on
to
raise
and
limit
themselves
to
you,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
and
the
fact
that
--
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
well,
their
basis
is
the
question
that
is
before
this
court
if
you
accept
jurisdiction.
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
well,
it
--
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
and
we
as
the
--
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
well,
i
think
the
--
my
first
reaction
to
answer
you,
sir
would
be
on
the
basis
that
since
we
are
here,
i'd
like
to
get
the
question
that
i
thought
was
before
this
court
answered.
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
well,
i
--
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
oh,
i
can't
answer
for
the
attorneys
for
the
--
the
appellants
in
this
case.
mr.
allison
and
i
are
depending
probably
upon
the
results
of
today's
election
might
be
back
up
here
on
this
case
again,
if
our
boss
is
elected.[laughter]
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
no,
sir.
he
is
--
he
is
an
appointed
official.
we
actually
--
our
office
does
not
represent
the
fire
marshal.
as
mr.
allison
pointed
out,
we're
in
this
case
because
the
sheriff
was
the
one
that
was
the
actual
defendant.
in
closing,
i
should
like
to
say
two
points.
i
should
like
to
urge
the
thought
upon
this
--
to
this
court
because
i
think
justice
frankfurter
in
effect
stated
in
the
oliver
case
that
--
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
no,
sir.
that
was
--
he
wrote
the
opinion,
but
in
his
--
in
his
opinion.
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
it
was
a
dissent,
sir.
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
well,
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
i
think
that
both
justice
black
and
justice
frankfurter
both
said
the
same
thing
and
under
different
language.
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
that
basically
in
an
investigation,
there
is
the
right
--
this
court
doesn't
under
the
fourteenth
intend
to
limit
the
state
as
to
the
means
that
it
chooses
for
investigation
so
long
as
before
that
person
is
convicted
or
is
find
that
they
may
have
the
benefits
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
if
the
states
selects
as
part
of
its
proving
of
the
investigation
to
make
the
hearing
secret,
then
that
is
up
to
the
state.
certainly,
in
the
grand
jury
there's
many
reasons
why
the
grand
jury's
probe
should
be
secret,
not
only
not
to
injure
and
embarrass
innocence.
that's
probably
the
chief
reason.
and
in
this
instance,
if
they
want
to
give
the
fire
marshal
that
right,
he
has
the
right.
but
the
fourteenth,
we
submit
does
not
mean
that
he
has
--
has
the
right
to
have
counsel
present
during
this
administrative
investigation
because
it
is
not
a
hearing.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
that
is
correct.
you
have
a
--
after
the
affidavit
or
the
arrest,
he
is
then
before
a
preliminary
magistrate
to
either
not
or
to
be
bound
over
to
the
grand
jury
in
grand
--
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
i
--
frankly,
i
came
across
an
old
case,
although
--
mr.
j.
ralston
werum
i
did
look
into
that
problem,
not
as
thoroughly
as
i
did
the
other
point.
