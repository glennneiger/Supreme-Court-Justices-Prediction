mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
i
should
first
attempt
to
clarify
certain
matters
which
arose
during
the
questioning
of
my
opposing
counsel
by
members
of
the
court.on
the
question
of
what
happened
in
this
case,
we
had
first
what
gave
at
least
some
appearance
of
being
an
incendiary
fire.
under
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
ohio,
the
state
fire
marshal
is
granted
the
power
and
given
the
duty
to
investigate
the
cause
and
origin
of
the
fire
to
see
whether
or
not
it
is
of
an
incendiary
nature.
he
is
given
the
power
to
summon
witnesses
and
to
hold
this
hearing.
and
at
that
point,
if
he
finds
there
is
evidence
of
a
crime,
primarily
the
crime
of
arson,
he
is
then
charged
with
the
duty
of
turning
over
that
evidence
to
the
prosecuting
attorney
for
presentment
at
that
stage
to
the
grand
jury
and
possible
indictment.
i
think
i
should
also
clarify
one
thing
here
and
that
is
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
of
franklin
county
appears
as
counsel
in
this
case
not
because
any
evidence
of
a
crime
was
turned
over
to
us,
but
in
the
nature
of
our
civil
function
as
legal
adviser
too
and
counsel
for
the
various
county
officials.
and
in
this
instance,
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
directed
against
the
sheriff
of
franklin
county.
there
has
not
been
a
charge
of
arson
placed
in
this
case.
the
petitioners
here
were
never
defendants.
in
fact,
when
the
summons
was
issued
--
and
these
witnesses,
and
they
are
only
witnesses,
that
distinction
must
be
kept
in
mind.
when
these
witnesses
appeared
and
refused
to
be
sworn
or
testify
without
the
presence
of
their
counsel,
this
habeas
corpus
was
filed.
and
this
habeas
corpus
became
a
vehicle
to
test
the
right
of
the
state
fire
marshal
to
exclude
counsel
from
this
hearing.
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
that
is
a
question,
your
honor,
which
i
believe
has
not
been
presented
in
this
case.
i
was
about
to
state
that
in
this
case,
the
men
were
never
actually
even
delivered
to
the
physical
custody
of
the
sheriff
of
franklin
county.
they
were
accompanied
when
the
fire
marshal
conducted
them
to
the
county
building
for
a
commitment
through
the
county
jail.
they
were
accompanied
by
their
counsel
and
their
counsel
secured
the
common
please
judge,
one
of
the
judges,
to
sign
an
entry
affixing
bail
in
this
case
in
the
amount
of
$100.
and
at
the
time
these
witnesses
were
conveyed
to
the
office
of
the
sheriff
to
be
turned
over
or
turned
into
his
custody,
the
entry
--
the
court
entry
fixing
bail
was
presented
to
the
sheriff
simultaneously
and
the
men
were
released
on
bond.
i
--
in
direct
answer
to
your
honors
question,
the
fact
that
these
men
have
been
free
at
all
times
since
the
date
of
this
hearing
and
that
this
action
was
brought
as
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
if
the
man
had
been
committed,
then
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
would
of
course
be
a
proper
vehicle.
on
the
other
hand,
the
bond
was
fixed
here
pursuant
to
the
writ
and
that
was
the
question
that
has
always
been
the
question
in
some
judges'
minds
as
to
the
effect
of
the
fixing
of
bond
upon
the
further
proceedings
on
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
i
believe
that's
right,
your
honor.
i
--i
would
like
to,
if
i
may,
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
court
here
postponed
any
further
question
or
any
further
argument
on
the
question
of
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
to
hear
this
matter
until
the
hearing
on
the
merits,
pursuant
to
the
court's
letter.
in
the
first
place,
i
think
it
has
been
adequately
shown,
both
by
the
briefs
and
by
the
statements
of
counsel,
that
if
there
is
any
question
before
this
court
that
is
properly
before
this
court,
it
is
a
very
limited
one.
i
would
like
to
merely
point
out
that
there
is
no
question
here
whatsoever
of
either
the
fifth
amendment
or
the
sixth
amendment.
i
believe
that
in
the
lower
courts,
there
was
some
extraneous
matters
came
in
to
the
point
that
there
was
--
believed
that
the
privilege
against
self
incrimination
might
come
in
here.
counsel
in
their
brief,
appellant's
counsel,
has
pointed
out
that
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
only
apply
to
the
federal
procedure
but
it's
even
more
than
that.
the
state
fire
marshal
in
this
case
has
never
contended
that
he
could
force
the
witnesses
before
him
to
answer
an
incriminating
question.
question
of
the
sixth
amendment
on
the
right
of
counsel,
there
is
no
trial
here.
there
is
no
accused.
these
men
have
not
been
accused
of
anything.
and
it
must
be
remembered
when
dealing
with
the
question
of
the
rights
of
witnesses
before
these
administrative
agents
that
some
of
these
witnesses
may
well
be
police
officers,
people
like
that.
there's
very
good
reason
for
the
secrecy
of
this
investigation
hearing
for
the
sole
reason
that
in
the
case
of
a
police
officer
who
is
coming
in,
who
may
have
helped
to
investigate
here,
he
may
be
in
the
possession
of
the
facts
which
if
they
were
disclosed
would
be
very
damaging.
so
that
the
sole
question
presented
to
this
court
is
as
to
whether
or
not
a
witness
summoned
before
this
administrative
official
has
a
right
in
this
investigation
to
be
represented
by
counsel.
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
mr.
justice,
may
i
answer
your
question
this
way?
at
the
time
of
this
hearing
and
today,
no
crime
has
been
determined
to
have
been
committed
here.
no
charges
had
been
placed
against
these
witnesses.
i
do
not
want
to
take
upon
myself
the
prerogative
of
the
state
fire
marshal
and
state
to
this
court
whether
or
not
the
state
fire
marshal
might
have
any
suspicion
in
his
mind
as
to
any
part
these
witnesses
might
have
played.
but
no,
it
has
not
even
been
determined
here
that
a
crime
has
been
committed.
that
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
--
is
the
purpose
of
this
investigation
and
the
record
so
shows.
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
the
--
the
record
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
the
record
only
shows,
mr.
justice,
certain
facts
that
--
or
certain
allegations
rather
in
the
petition
for
the
writ
itself
and
in
other
statements
of
counsel
that
they
were
under
suspicion.
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
no,
sir.
it
was
not
denied.
i
--
as
i
say,
i
cannot
speak
for
the
fire
marshal
and
state
what
suspicions
he
might
have
in
his
mind
as
to
the
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
--
part
these
witnesses
may
have
played.
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
to
the
petition
in
the
common
pleas
court?
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
an
answer
was
--
a
written
answer
or
a
formal
answer
was
not
filed.
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
let
me
--
let
me
perhaps
describe
the
circumstances
under
which
that
writ
was
filed.
that
might
clarify
it
for
you.
the
fire
marshal
was
--
entered
the
courthouse
with
these
two
men
for
commitment.
mr.
graham
at
that
time,
having
had
a
written
petition
for
a
habeas
corpus
prepared
to
file
in
the
supreme
court
on
the
sole
question
which
is
now
before
this
court,
presented
that
same
petition
modified
to
50
common
pleas
court
rather
than
the
supreme
court
to
judge
clifford
of
our
court
of
common
pleas.
judge
clifford
set
bond
and,
if
my
recollection
serves
me
right,
set
an
oral
hearing
on
the
matter.
immediately
set
the
oral
hearing
for
a
few
days
in
the
future.
the
oral
hearing,
as
i
recall
it,
was
a
very
light
thing.
there
was
--
there
were
no
--
there
were
no
written
answers
filed.
the
petition
was
not
demurred
to
or
anything
along
those
lines.
at
that
time
then,
appeal
was
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
the
supreme
court,
both
of
which
courts
unanimously
upheld
judge
clifford's
decision
in
the
lower
court
on
the
question.
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
your
honor,
the
fire
marshal,
the
purpose
of
this
investigation
was
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
crime
had
been
committed.
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
the
statute
sets
forth
the
purpose
on
this
investigation.
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
well,
the
petition,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
justice,
states
that
petitioners
say
that
said
officer
intends
to
examine
them
under
oath
pertaining
to
what
an
alleged
criminal
offense
and
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
--
like
matters.
there
was
no
opportunity
to
file
a
written
answer
to
this
petition
prior
to
the
oral
hearing
and
that
after
the
oral
hearing.
of
course,
the
question
was
--
by
that
time,
on
its
way
to
the
higher
courts.
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
i
believe
that's
--
i
believe
there's
an
affidavit
or
something
in
the
record
to
that
effect.
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
to
go
back
two
and
a
half
years,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
--
i
just
cannot
recall
the
exact
length
of
time
between
the
time
this
written
petition
was
filed
and
the
day
it
was
set
for
an
oral
hearing.
it
was
answered
orally
as
i
recall
it
in
court
a
few
days
later.
i
--
i
cannot
say
just
how
long.
at
any
rate,
it
was
answered
orally
and
not
by
written
answer
or
a
return.
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
i
believe
if
--
if
my
memory
serves
me
correct,
a
--
a
written
return
was
filed
on
behalf
of
the
sheriff
of
franklin
county
stating
that
he
did
hold
the
petitioners
pursuant
to
a
commitment
by
the
fire
marshal
under
section
3737.99
and
that
was
the
sole
extent
of
anything
filed.
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
the
usual
return
as
to
the
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
--
the
fact
that
he
was
--
did
have
technical
custody
often,
although
they
were
out
on
bail.
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
that
is
what
he
was
investigating,
your
honor.
the
circumstances
--
the
statute
provides
that
the
state
fire
marshal
shall
investigate
the
circumstances
and
the
origin
of
the
fire
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
is
of
an
incendiary
nature.
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
the
letter,
mr.
justice,
which
we
received
from
the
supreme
court,
from
this
court
stated
--
the
statement
of
jurisdiction
in
this
case
having
been
submitted
and
considered
by
the
court
--
further
consideration
of
the
question
of
jurisdiction
is
postponed
to
the
hearing
of
the
case
on
the
merits.
parties
are
requested
to
discuss
in
their
briefs
and
oral
arguments
this
court's
jurisdiction
to
consider
any
question
raised
by
the
possible
applicability
of
the
murchison
and
oliver
cases.
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
yes,
that
is
the
order
of
this
court.
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
yes.
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
the
--
and
i
would
like
at
this
point
to
take
up
the
applicability
of
the
oliver
and
murchison
cases
to
the
question
here.
i
think
that
the
court
is
by
this
time
fully
aware
that
the
--
those
two
cases
are
not
similar
in
their
facts
to
the
case
that
we
have
here.
in
fact,
i
think
this
court
in
the
majority
opinion
itself
answered
the
question
of
the
applicability
of
the
--
those
of
the
oliver
case
to
the
question
here
where
the
court
said,
“here,”
meaning
in
the
oliver
case,
“we
are
concerned
not
with
petitioner's
rights
as
a
witness
in
a
grand
jury
session
but
with
his
rights
as
a
defendant
in
a
contempt
proceeding.”
the
question
here
is
the
question
of
the
rights
of
the
witness
before
this
investigative
hearing
and
not
as
a
defendant
because
there's
--
as
appropriately
pointed
out
by
opposing
counsel.
the
--
the
question
of
the
commitment
here
has
never
been
raised,
either
in
the
--
that
is
the
validity
of
the
commitment.
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
he
was
a
--
he
was
committed
for
contempt
that
in
the
trial,
this
whole
thing
arose.
but
the
--
the
question
before
this
court,
since
the
sole
question
which
has
been
put
in
issue
is
the
right
of
the
fire
marshal
to
hold
his
investigation
in
secret,
is
that
the
question
of
the
rights
of
the
witness
and
not
the
rights
of
the
defendant
in
a
contempt
proceeding.
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
if
it
please
the
court.
we
were
just
before
the
recess
discussing
the
question
of
this
court's
jurisdiction
to
hear
this
particular
case.
we
have
presented
certain
matters
to
the
court,
which
i
believe
clearly
indicates
that
this
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction
to
consider
the
sole
question
which
is
raised
here.
i
would
like
to
merely
bring
out
one
or
two
other
points.
perhaps,
they
are
repetitious
and
so,
they
are
deserving
of
emphasis.
first
of
all,
this
hearing,
which
has
been
referred
to
as
a
hearing
is
not
a
--
in
fact,
a
hearing
at
all.
it
is
described
as
an
investigation.
purpose
of
that
investigation
is
not
merely
to
find
out
if
somebody
is
guilty
of
a
crime
and
then
charge
him
with
arson
but
it
is
to
find
out
certain
other
facts,
because
of
the
fire
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
in
incendiary
in
nature
or
the
result
of
carelessness
and
perhaps
other
matters
which
come
within
the
province
of
the
state
fire
marshal
of
the
state
of
ohio.
secondly,
there
is
one
point
which
i
would
like
to
bring
out
at
this
time,
and
that
is
that
we
have
stayed
away
in
this
case
from
the
question
of
the
enforcement
here.
we
did
not
want
to
bring
in
collateral
matters
which
we
felt
had
--
would
only
more
or
less
clutter
up
the
case,
but
the
court's
attention
should
be
directed
to
the
fact
that
although,
section
3737.99
provides
a
more
or
less
summary
commitment,
there
is
an
alternative
procedure
which
could
be
followed
here,
and
that
is
ohio
revised
code
section
29
--
27
--
2917.26
is
a
general
section
which
makes
it
a
misdemeanor
to
commit
contempt
by
refusing
to
obey
the
subpoena
of
or
to
refuse
to
answer
questions
or
refuse
to
be
sworn
of
a
court
or
other
legal
authority.
other
term
or
other
legal
authority
there
would
cover
of
course
the
many
state
departments,
administrative
departments
which
do
have
the
power
to
subpoena
and
examine
witness
before
them.
so
that
--
that
section
also
provides
that
that
would
be
handled
in
the
usual
manner
of
going
in
before
a
court
and
having
that
contempt
charge
would
be
an
open
hearing
and
that
would
of
course,
do
away
completely
with
any
application
of
the
oliver
and
murchison
cases
here.
so
that
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
i
suggest
that
in
view
of
the
oliver
and
murchison
cases,
i
would
hope
that
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
ohio
who
is
the
legal
adviser
to
the
fire
marshal
might
point
out
the
possible
advisability
of
following
that
procedure.
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
he
--
he
did
deliver
this
man
to
the
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
to
the
sheriff
for
commitment.
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
as
i
stated
earlier,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
men
were
never
actually
committed,
that's
why
i
hesitate
to
say
“yes”
to
your
question
--
to
your
question.
he
was
delivered
for
commitment
but
before
they
could
be
committed,
they
were
released.

technical
commitment,
once
they
were
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
--
released
on
--
on
bond.
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
well,
i
was
more
or
less
lost
in
the
simultaneous
circumstances
here
which
occurred
all
at
the
same
time.
he
was
delivered
to
the
courthouse.
he
was
delivered
to
the
sheriff's
office
for
a
commitment
and
the
sheriff,
as
you
point
out,
did
enter
and
open
the
court
and
in
his
return,
state
that
he
had
received
custody
of
these
individuals
and
that
they
were
then
and
still
are
out
on
bond.
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
that
--
that's
correct.
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
now,
with
that,
i
believe
that
i
have
completed
our
arguments
as
to
the
question
of
this
court's
jurisdiction
to
pass
upon
the
question
raised
by
appellant,
namely,
the
right
of
counsel
in
this
investigative
hearing
and
the
effect
thereon
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
that
the
argument
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
in
the
event
the
court
decides
to
proceed
with
this
matter,
the
argument
as
to
whether
or
not
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
apply
to
the
matter
here
before
the
court
for
consideration
will
be
presented
by
my
colleague,
mr.
werum.
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
i
cite
that
as
an
alternative
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
--
to
the
commitment
provision
which
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
--
merely
the
--
this
--
the
applicability
of
the
oliver
case
here
was
to
the
effect
that
the
defendant
in
a
contempt
proceeding
would
--
was
not
granted
the
right
of
trial
in
open
court.
under
this
other
section,
which
i
have
just
referred
to,
that
does
provide
for
a
contempt
charge
makes
it
a
misdemeanor
and
would,
of
course,
provide
such
a
hearing
in
open
court
besides
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
your
honor,
that
section
has
no
application.
that
section
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
--
was
not
used
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
--
rather,
the
alternative
section.
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
i
--
i
am
merely
trying
to
point
out,
mr.
justice,
that
counsel
for
the
appellants
have
stated
previously
in
their
argument
that
this
private
hearing
could
not
be
enforced
because
if
this
--
if
it
were
committed
here,
if
the
witnesses
did
answer
questions
or
refused
to
answer
after
they
were
sworn
that
the
oliver
case
would
apply,
i
was
merely
trying
to
point
out
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
--
to
the
court
that
if
we
went
by
the
other
proceeding
in
the
future,
the
oliver
case
would
still
have
no
application.
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
but
it
must
be
remembered
here
that
these
witnesses,
when
they
were
summoned,
even
refused
to
take
a
note.
this
is
not
a
question
of
refusing
to
answer
a
question
directed
to
them
which
might
have
been
--
they
might
have
claimed
self-incrimination
or
something
like
that.
that
question
is
not
before
this
court.
these
witnesses
refused
even
to
be
sworn
when
they
entered
this
investigative
hearing.
and
that
of
course,
in
our
opinion,
is
only
a
further
point
that
this
court
has
--
this
should
not
take
jurisdiction
to
consider
the
question
which
is
presented
here.
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
yes.
as
i
understand
it,
i
was
not
present
at
the
time
of
the
hearing.
i
understand
that
at
the
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
--
time
of
the
hearing
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
their
sole
objection
was
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
--
that
the
counsel
could
be
present.
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
the
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
the
--
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
understand
your
question,
mr.
justice,
as
to
what
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
--
whether
the
petition
raised
a
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
oh,
in
the
petition
itself?
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
no,
it
certainly
not.
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
the
federal
question
was
first
raised
by
the
appellants
in
their
brief
which
they
submitted
or
in
the
argument
which
they
submitted
on
the
--
in
the
common
pleas
court
to
which
the
--
which
first
heard
the
writ,
that
the
question
was
raised
in
the
common
pleas
court
and
was
pursued
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
supreme
court
of
ohio.
mr.
earl
w.
allison,
jr.
the
court
--
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
and
the
preceding
courts
as
shown
by
the
court's
decision
did
state
that
there
was
no
federal
or
no
question
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.

question
was
raised

in

briefs

was
argued.
now,
there
was

as
i
stated
earlier,
there
were
references
to
both
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
which
appellants
rapidly
admitted
were
not
before
the
court.
and
then,
also,
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
raised
in
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
mr.
earl

and
the
court
--
the

that
in
passing
on
it,
the
court
merely
said,
"it
is
apparent
that
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
appellant
have
not
been
violated
and
that
the
lower
courts
were
correct
in
denying
the
release
sought."

opinion
of
the

court
of

was
not
a

one.
