justice
hugo
l.
black
can
it
do
that
employer
by
employer
or
does
it
claim
the
right
to
do
it
by
a
general
rule?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then
in
this
case,
did
they
do
it
on
a
basis
of
renounced
jurisdiction
on
the
basis
of
this
particular
case
and
what
it
involved
or
did
they
do
it
on
the
basis
of
a
general
rule
such
as
a
general
law
would
be?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
to
whom
--
as
to
whom
--
presume
that
might
possibly
make
a
difference.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
--
if
not,
the
board
could
--
if
it
saw
fit,
subject
employers
at
exactly
the
same
type,
to
one
law
and
other
employers
of
that
type
to
a
different
law
without
the
fact,
putting
them
within
in
the
jones
category.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
i
--
i
understand
that's
your
position.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
wasn't
asking
you
about
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
claim.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
--
what
i
was
asking
was
whether
--
not
whether
they
would
hear
one
employer
and
--
and
not
hear
another,
but
whether
they
could
by
declining
to
hear
one
employer
and
not
hearing
another
and
sending
it
to
a
state
court,
whether
they
could
do
that
knowing
that
the
law
would
be
entirely
different
to
be
applied
to
one
employer
would
be
applied
to
another.
if
you
assume
that
the
state
law
doesn't
have
to
be
consistent
to
the
federal
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
not?
why
can't
you
act
in
connection
with
the
session?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
qualifying
provisions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
--
i
understand
that
you
--
i
understand
that
you
told
us,
the
law
is
consistent
and
that
--
what
would
be
--
what
would
there
be
to
prevent
a
session
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
this
case,
the
--
the
act
is
--
utah
has
acted,
as
i
understand
it,
altogether
consistently
with
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
here,
it's
quite
different
to
the
other
cases
i
would
suppose.
you
have
no
question
of
inconsistency
as
to
this.
and
the
sole
question
is,
get
down
finally
to
the
point
as
to
whether
the
exclusive
method
of
exercising
state
jurisdiction
is
by
session.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
dispute
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
stated
another
way,
your
position,
isn't
it,
that
congress
authorized
states
to
exercise
jurisdiction
in
these
labor
cases
affecting
commerce
if
a
formal
session
was
made?congress
did
that.
but
that
--
in
addition
to
that,
you
want
us
to
construe
the
act
as
meaning
that
the
board
by
declining
to
exercise
jurisdiction
in
other
and
different
cases
can
give
the
states
jurisdiction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
made
those
arguments?
they
are
pretty
good.
[laughter]
it's
not
--
be
good
enough
but
they're
pretty
good.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
congress
was
aware
of
it
because
they
were
so
aware
of
the
bethlehem
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
amended
it
to
grant
--
state
jurisdiction
that
there
was
assessment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
didn't
do
the
other?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
know
whether
the
board
asked
the
congress
to
change
this
or
not
or
just
going
to
the
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
then,
they
always
have
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
sometimes,
to
the
pressure
against
the
appropriations
which
have
something
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
[laughs]
--
as
you
know.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
know
whether
the
board
has
asked
for
greater
appropriations
in
order
to
try
these
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
know
whether
they've
asked
for
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
be
a
little
surprising
to
get
one.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
must
have
misunderstood
you
because
on
page
26
or
27
of
your
brief,
you
cite
the
house
report
which
said
they
were
taking
action
to
meet
the
situation
made
possible
by
the
bethlehem
steel
corporation
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
--
you're
quoting
from
the
opinion,
not
from
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
they
joined
you
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
know
whether
what
persuaded
them
[laughs]
but
at
least
they
joined.
but
they
point
out
that
these
so-called
yardsticks
are
not
rules
and
regulations.
they
were
never
issued
under
the
provisions
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
or
any
other
formalities
required
of
formal
administrative
rules
and
regulations.
they
just
said
in
a
--
in
a
press
release,
"this
is
what
we're
going
to
do
in
the
future
and
in
effect,
govern
yourselves
accordingly."
and
then
in
a
case-by-case
program,
they
have
attempted
to
implement
that
press
release.
and
his
brief
shows
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
billings,
do
you
suppose
that
--
that
on
account
of
the
fact
that
you
and
your
adversaries
have
agreed,
both
party
are
taking
the
same
side,
some
of
these
complicated
questions
could
be
escaped
as
being
removed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
see.
you
just
agreed
with
the
steelworkers
but
they're
yours
--
but
they
were
yours,
but
adversary
for
a
second.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
see.
[laughs]
