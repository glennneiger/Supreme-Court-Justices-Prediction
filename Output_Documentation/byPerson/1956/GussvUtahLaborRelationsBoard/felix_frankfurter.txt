what
was
the
date,
please?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
remanding
stationary
to
date?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
are
general
--
they
are
general
persons.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
do
that
everyday
when
they
entertain
a
complaint
or
when
they
don't
entertain
a
complaint.
it
makes
a
decision
as
to
--
it
might
be
ahead,
practical
difference
to
the
fact.
i
mean
in
situation
which
this
problem
doesn't
arise
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
whole
point
of
having
an
intervening
administrative
agency
doing
to
accept
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
under
--
you
mean
if
they
avail
themselves
of
the
--
a
party
to
see
--
formally
to
see
to
a
state,
the
state
jurisdiction,
is
that
what
you're
talking
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
if
you're
right
about
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
then
the
other
problems
doesn't
arise.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

and
to
raise
this
kind
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
argumentatively
raise
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
that
was
a
problem
of
the
defendants,
not
quite
in
that
form
but
that
would
be
essentially,
this
difficulty
that
the
defendants
had
in
the
san
diego
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wouldn't
believe
that's
--
or
just
about
that
because
i
think
conceivable
that
a
state
may
--
a
state
may
have
an
administrative
agency,
the
purpose
of
accepting
the
cases
that
should
be
allowed
to
be
brought
in
the
state
court
under
the
fela,
and
i
see
no
difficulty
of
that.
there
may
be
(inaudible)
whereby
the
state
agency
might
determine
whether
or
not
this
comes
within
the
federal
employee
liability
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is,
we've
rendered
about
a
half
a
dozen
cases
which
we
create
its
no
man's
land.
now,
i
know
bethlehem,
all
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
which
we
said,
"never
mind
whether
the
labor
board
did
anything
or
we'll
do
anything,
you're
out."
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
we
know
very
well
in
both
of
those
cases
nothing
happened.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
we'll,
you
don't
have
to
have
a
law
of
covering
everything,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
attorney
general,
may
i
ask
if
your
--
your
consideration
to
this
problem
if
they
decide
qualification
to
what
you've
said,
i
wish
--
my
regret,
the
government
isn't
here
as
argue
what
they
have
said
in
the
brief.
and
they
say
it
should
be
noted
here
that
the
board
has
been
unable,
unable,
unable
because
of
the
prescribed
condition
to
consummate
any
such
agreements.
i
--
i
--
that's
a
little
(inaudible)
i
must
understand
because
the
provision
is
not
as
you
indicated
that
the
state
law
must
be
consistent
where
that
the
state
must
have
--
in
other
words,
section
10
(a),
the
--
with
an
implication
of
an
incitement
to
get
the
states
to
pass
little
wagner
act.
the
--
the
condition
for
taft-hartley
act,
the
condition
is
not
as
such,
they
must
have
the
same
kind
of
a
statute
but
there
must
be
nothing
inconsistent
with
them
which
will
be
considerable
difference
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
or
maybe
lacking
in
certain
provisions
of
the
taft-hartley
act
of
its
comparisons.
and
if
that
wouldn't
constitute
as
inconsistent
provision,
isn't
that
so?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand.
i
wish
the
court
as
in
a
more
illuminating
on
this
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
there's
then
in
other
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
there
isn't
any
doubt
about
it.
is
there
any
disagreement
that
there
must
be
that
this
10
(a)
calls
a
law
of
formal
arrangement
between
the
board
and
the
state
authority?
is
there
any
doubt
about
that?
i'm
not
reaching
the
question
that's
before
us
empowered
by
agreement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
that
must
be
formalized
in
some
way
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
that's
what
we
have
in
bethlehem.
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
haven't
gotten
around
to
where
they
must
but
aren't
there
seven
cases?
the
welch
is
one,
in
which
this
--
which
congress
passed
to
the
statute,
but
then
requires
the
--
it
used
the
current
phrase
--
implementing
of
that
statute
by
rules
and
regulations.
there
are
several
such
cases
in
this
court,
aren't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
this
court
has
held
the
mere
potential
authorization
of
issue
enforcing
rules,
doesn't
in
this
larger
case
however.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
position
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
always
tell
what
the
area
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
they
give
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
dollars
--
but
dollar
--
dollar
isn't
the
only
guide?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
would
be
if
it
were
the
only
one
but
they
--
there
are
other
substantive
yardsticks.
justice
felix
frankfurter
kind
of
a
business
you
are,
leave
that
controversy
here
as
to
whether
you
come
within
the
union
as
employer
for
instance?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
rest
--
and
you
rest
that,
i
take
it,
or
so
you
take
that
view.
you
rest
that
in
part
on
the
authority
of
--
on
the
provision
of
the
statute,
i
forgot
what
section
it
is,
that
the
board
can
make
rules
or
regulations
to
effectuate
the
purposes.
and
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
act
is
to
be
able
efficiently
to
carry
it
out.
and
the
board
has
ruled
that
then
they
carry
it
out
efficiently
to
answer
to
all
discrepancies.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
we've
been
told
that
in
1954,
it's
practically
in
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
just
seems
frequent
to
be
more
a
popular,
so
that
is
amplified
due
to
fighting
this
to
the
congress.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
certainly
is
that
congress
is
awfully
discreet
about
telling
us
what
it
intends
to
do.
they're
awfully
--
renders
in
party
of
our
country.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
tell
us
what
they
thought
about
the
bethlehem
case?
i
don't
mean
whether
they
thought
including
that.
they're
a
very
busy
party,
in
some
other
things,
this
is
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
i
trouble
you
of
where
you're
reading
from.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
--
may
i
trouble
you,
mr.
billings?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
particular
reason
where
as
the
minority
reports
that
was
referred
to
the
allied
case,
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it's
the
same.
it's
another
case
decided
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
any
reason
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
my
mind
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
consider
by
the
board
as
you
know
this
is
together
with
deciding
to
it
and
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
in
that,
is
this
the
only
explicit
reference
in
the
bethlehem's
decision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
terribly
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
terribly
say
they
were
irrelevant
about
it
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
persuaded
them,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
the
meaning,
from
the
point
of
view
of
policy
the
desirable
thing
to
have
predominantly
local
--
incident
of
local
industrial
difficulty
decided
by
the
locality
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
--
when
you
emphasize
that
this
came
out
on
a
press
release,
we
don't
need
to
imply
the
informality
of
the
communication,
it's
what
troubles
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

difference
if
they
had
formal
regulation
act
for
hearing
appropriate
parties,
say,
the
national
manufacturer,
the
national
chamber
of
commerce,
the
afl-cio
and
then
from
the
--
would
that
make
a
difference
to
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
nothing
or
have
made
some
and
i
may
have
missed
it.
have
you
said
anything
about
that
power?
did
they
address
themselves
as
you
--
that's
probably
a
kind
of
color
to
use,
to
say
they
won't
deal
with
these
cases?is
there
anything
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
of
their
power
might
as
relevant
to
problems
of
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
that
the
whole
question
whether
they
have
--
this
court
once
having
said
what
it
decided
in
(inaudible)
construing
the
statute
to
be
what
it
--
bound
it
to
be.
isn't
there
no
question
that
the
board
may
say,
you
would
take
any
case
that
has
turn
over
(inaudible)
the
next
undecided
case
problems?
is
there
--
i'm
just
asking
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
court
is
merely
empowered
or
directed
as
by
lawsuits
in
statutes
to
be
brought?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
the
question
of
"shall
have
jurisdiction"
i
think
in
the
old
icc
case.
it'll
probably
(inaudible)
they
were
mandamus,
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
very
--
the
antecedent
question,
whether
that's
the
duty
and
charged
with
the
responsibility
and
whether
they
can
and
what
kind
of
a
legal
showing
that
they
have
made
and
said
in
discretion
with
us,
that
there
are
so
many
cases.
i
looked
up
their
last
report.
they
only
had
14,000
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
contested
in
the
recent
decision
in
the
court
of
appeals,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
happen
to
know
how
many
--
whether
in
district
courts,
there
have
been
--
how
many
cases
do
you
know
have
come
up
or
they
would
be
the
court
of
appeals
initiative.
how
many
cases
have
arisen
which
it's
not
by
way
of
mandamus
but
somebody
says
here,
your
yardstick
doesn't
apply
to
the
new
laws
of
--
applied
it
under
them?
is
the
litigation
--
is
the
litigation
seemed
to
be
flourishing
if
there
was
a
(inaudible)
body
of
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
haven't
agreed
with
the
utah
labor
relation.
