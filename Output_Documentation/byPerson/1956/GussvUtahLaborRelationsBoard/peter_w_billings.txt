mr.
peter
w.
billings
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
that
perhaps
this,
the
third
of
these
three
cases,
brings
in
clearest
focus
the
issue
which
has
tied
the
three
together.
that
is
the
question
of
whether
10
(a)
provides
the
exclusive
manner
in
which
states
may
attempt
to
regulate
unfair
labor
practices
as
defined
in
the
act
when
they
affect
interstate
commerce.
in
this
case,
the
appellant
is
engaged
in
the
manufacture
of
special
photographic
equipment
for
the
air
force.
i
--
i
think
he
most
ably
fits
this
definition
of
a
borderline
industry
so
far
as
interstate
commerce
is
concerned
as
used
in
the
statutory
history
of
section
10
(a).
the
total
amount
of
these
three
contracts
was
around
$150,000.
he
purchased
about
$50,000
worth
of
materials
from
outside
of
the
state
and
delivered
the
finished
special
equipment
to
the
air
force
to
bases
both
inside
the
state
of
utah
and
in
other
air
force
bases
throughout
the
united
states.
he
had
his
employee
according
to
the
ballot
conducted
by
the
nlrb,
26
employees.
soon
after
he
started
performance
of
these,
the
three
contracts,
the
steelworkers
union
filed
a
petition
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
for
certification
of
the
steelworkers
as
the
bargaining
representative
for
his
employees.
and
the
day
that
the
hearing
was
set
on
such
petition,
the
union
and
mr.
guss
entered
into
an
agreement
for
a
consent
election
to
be
conducted
by
the
nlrb.
that
was
--
and
that
election
was
conducted
in
may
of
1954
and
the
steelworkers
union
prevailed
by
a
vote
of
15
to
--
25
to
11
and
the
union
was
duly
certified
by
the
national
board.
very
shortly
after,
within
a
week
after
that
certification
was
issued,
the
union
filed
with
the
national
board
a
complaint
alleging
unfair
labor
practices,
both
in
the
conduct
of
the
election
in
the
alleging
discriminatory
discharges
of
some
of
these
employees
and
a
refusal
to
bargain.
and
thereupon,
the
national
board
conducted
an
investigation
of
these
charges
between
that
day
and
july
of
1954.
in
other
words,
just
over
a
couple
of
months.
on
july
1st
and
july
15th
of
1954,
the
board
came
down
with
its
new
jurisdictional
yardsticks
under
terms
of
which
the
appellant
here
clearly
fall
without.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
july
1st
and
15th,
your
honor,
1954
as
when
they
were
announced
in
the
press
releases.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
yes,
your
honor,
they
have
not
been
changed
except
as
in
case
--
by
case
determination.
they
may
have
been
expended.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
that's
right.
and
so
on
july
21st,
1954,
the
regional
director
of
the
national
board
advised
the
union
that
he
would
not
process
their
--
further
their
complaint
on
the
ground
that
it
would
not
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act
for
the
national
board
to
do
so.
the
--
thereupon,
without
any
appeal
to
the
national
board
as
the
letter
of
declination
invited,
the
union
filed
almost
exactly
the
same
charge
with
the
utah
labor
relations
board.
and
within
a
few
months,
the
--
the
utah
board
held
a
hearing
and
made
the
determinations
from
which
this
appeal
was
taken.
the
utah
board
is
set
up
under
the
utah
act
which
is
--
which
might
be
characterized
as
a
little
wagner
act.
it
was
passed
in
1937
shortly
after
the
wagner
act
was
passed
by
the
national
congress
and
was
patterned
on
it.
instead
of
talking
about
interstate
commerce
or
affecting
interstate
commerce
as
the
national
act
did,
it
uses
the
words
intrastate
commerce
and
the
orderly
operation
of
industry
and
is
ministered
by
a
board
similar
to
the
national
board.
however,
in
1947,
it
was
again
amended
to
add
certain
unfair
labor
practices
of
employer
--
of
employees
as
well
as
employers,
but
it
was
not
amended
to
conform
to
the
taft-hartley
act
which
was
passed
in
the
same
year
and
it
has
not
been
since
amended,
so
that
everyone
here
concerned
in
this
case
concedes
that
the
utah
statute
does
not
meet
the
requirements
of
section
10
(a),
that
it
--
it
does
not
have
consistent
corresponding
provisions
to
the
national
act.
some
of
the
particular
differences
which
might
be
pointed
out
are
that
the
utah
act
has
no
provision
for
the
filing
of
non-communist
affidavits
by
union
officers
and
by
the
filing
of
financial
reports
by
unions.
it
does
not
provide
for
the
60-day
cooling-off
period
for
the
respective
strikes
and
it
has
different
standards
for
the
determination
of
a
bargaining
unit
in
the
first
place,
so
there
are
real
and
substantial
differences
in
the
act.
we
raised
the
issue
of
the
power
of
the
state
board
to
issue
any
order
in
this
action
at
the
commencement
of
the
hearing
and
throughout
that
hearing
and
appeal
under
the
state
statutory
procedure
to
the
utah
supreme
court
raising
the
same
issues.
and
that
was
the
only
issue
passed
upon
by
the
utah
supreme
court.
the
utah
court
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
state
board
that
it
had
jurisdiction
on
the
basis
that
there
was
intrastate
as
well
as
interstate
commerce
involved.
relying
on
the
decision
of
the
california
court
in
the
garmon
case
which
came
out
only
a
few
weeks
before
this
case
was
decided
and
arguing
that
unless
it
did
so,
this
so-called
“no
man's
land”
would
prevail.
now,
i
think
that
this
case
i
have
here
has
these
distinctions
from
the
two
which
we
have
heard
before.
one,
and
i
think
perhaps
the
most
important
that
here,
there
is
a
state
board
and
a
state
statute
involved
rather
than
a
state
court.
secondly,
the
national
board
actually
asserted
jurisdiction
in
the
proceedings
and
then
within
--
within
two
months
after
that,
declined
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
unclaimed
unfair
labor
practices
arriving
--
rising
out
--
out
of
the
very
election
which
the
national
board
had
conducted.
and
thirdly,
different
from
the
other
two,
is
an
employer
here
who
is
raising
the
issue,
point
being
that
the
sword
of
exclusiveness
of
10
(a)
cuts
both
ways.
we
join
with
counsel
for
the
unions
in
the
two
preceding
cases
in
our
position
that
based
on
the
express
language
of
10
(a)
based
on
its
legislative
history,
it
provides
the
only,
the
exclusive
manner
in
which
the
states
may
act
in
matters
affecting
interstate
commerce
where
there
are
parallel
provisions
between
state
and
federal
law,
and
this
is
certainly
one
of
those.
we
have
the
same
pattern
in
our
statute
as
is
in
the
national
statute
for
the
certification
of
a
union
for
election
to
be
conducted
by
a
board
and
for
a
board
to
hear
charges
of
unfair
labor
practices
of
both
employees
and
employers.
but
aside
from
that
same
general
framework
as
i
have
pointed
out,
there
are
--
are
real
and
substantial
differences.
and
of
course,
one
of
the
most
important
from
the
standpoint
of
an
employer
and
his
employees
who
may
be
members
of
the
union
which
is
seeking
to
organize
his
employees
is
a
question
of
--
of
sections
9
(f)
and
(g)
of
the
national
act
which
require
the
union
before
it
can
avail
itself
of
the
national
board
to
file
the
non-communist
affidavit
of
its
officers
and
the
provisions
which
require
the
union
officers
to
file
financial
statements.
those
protections
are
not
given
in
the
utah
act.
so
that
if
the
utah
act
is
applied,
certainly,
this
employer
and
his
employees
are
deprived
of
rights
given
to
them
under
the
national
act.
therefore,
if
the
board
can
do
as
it
attempted
to
do
in
this
case
and
merely
by
declining
to
act,
place
jurisdiction
in
the
state
board,
it
can
do
that
which
congress
said
it
couldn't
do
and
that
is
make
an
employer
who's
been
as
affects
interstate
commerce
subject
to
statutes
which
are
different
from
the
national.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
as
i
read
section
10
(a),
your
honor,
it
says
in
any
cases
and
then
it
sets
down
at
the
--
in
those
cases,
the
state
statute
must
have
corresponding
provisions
not
inconsistent
with
the
federal
statute,
and
i
would
think
it
would
have
to
do
it
by
general
categories
and
not
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
i
would
say
that
we
did
it
on
the
basis
of
their
jurisdictional
yardsticks
which
are
general
rule.
they
were
published,
as
i
said,
a
week
or
10
days
before
the
letter
of
the
board
declining
to
act.
the
letter
of
the
board
does
not
expressly
incorporate
the
yardsticks
but
i
was
informed
by
counsel
for
the
board
that
that
was
what
they
meant
when
they
said
in
their
letter,
“will
not
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
act.”
that
was
the
language
they
used.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
i
presume
it
might
well,
if
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
i
would
say
they
could
only
do
that
if
they
--
if
the
state
law
were
--
met
the
requirements
of
section
10
(a)
of
the
national
act.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
yes.
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
yes,
that's
perfectly
true.
otherwise
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
exactly,
your
honor
i
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
yes.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
my
point
is
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
well,
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
they
could
not
take
such
action
unless
the
state
law
were
consistent.
and
--
in
my
--
i
make
that
point
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
that
and
i
say
that
is
the
only
way
they
may
do
it.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
so
that
if
they
did
at
any
other
way,
they
are
in
effect
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
yes.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
yes.
and
i
--
and
i'm
really
seeking
to
emphasize
that
point
by
pointing
out
the
situation
in
this
case
where
under
the
doctrine
of
the
arkansas
oak
flooring
case
decided
this
last
term
by
this
court,
the
national
act
applies
to
this
situation
even
though
the
board
may
not
act
for
reasons
of
its
own
or
for
reasons
set
forth
in
the
act.
still,
the
national
act
applies.
and
i
understand
that's
the
issue
which
the
national
board
raised
in
its
brief
which
mr.
justice
harlan
inquired
about.
i
think
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
i
think
it
raised
the
very
--
clearly,
your
honor,
in
the
how
can
the
utah
board
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
well,
yes.it
was
not
raised
down
there,
surely.
but
i
think
the
--
the
issue
is
--
is
there
because
how
can
a
state
board
which
is
a
creature
of
state
statute
and
which
is
authorized
only
to
enforce
state
law,
how
can
it
here
apply
national
law?
it
has
no
authority.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that's
what
makes
my
case
all
the
stronger
than
the
san
diego
case.
i
can
see
a
state
court
enforcing
a
law
--
a
federal
law.
it
does
it
all
the
time.
now,
a
--
a
labor
law
maybe
a
little
more
peculiar
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out
in
the
--
in
the
--
a
state
court's
ability
to
--
to
formulate.
but
certainly,
a
state
court
can
do
that
but
i
don't
--
my
point
is
that
a
state
board,
a
creature
of
state
statute
with
jurisdiction
limited
to
that
statute
can't
enforce
a
--
a
national
act
and
the
national
act
is
the
one
that
clearly
applies
here.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
well,
i
think
--
i'm
not
saying
constitutionally,
that
could
not
be
done.
i'm
saying
though
that
a
state
board
which
has
its
power
limited
in
this
--
as
it
is
here
to
enforcing
a
state
act
couldn't
very
well
do
that
unless
the
state
legislature
said
it
could.
that's
my
point,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
the
--
the
only
other
thing
i
think
that
need
be
said
in
this
case
is
the
--
with
respect
to
this
so-called
“no
man's
land”
that
seems
to
worry
everyone
is
that
that
is
within
what
congress
felt
its
policy,
what
it
was
to
be.
that
is
that
the
national
act
was
to
apply,
the
national
policy
was
to
apply.
if
the
states
wanted
to
enforce
it,
that
policy
in
situations
where
the
national
board
for
some
reasons
of
budgetary
faults,
they
did
not
choose
to
act.
the
states
could
do
so
if
they
subscribe
to
the
national
act
by
enforcing
--
by
enacting
statutes
like
the
national
act.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
yes.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
yes.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
but
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
exactly.
and
that
if
--
if
the
legislature
wants
to
--
to
meet
10
(a),
it
may
do
so.
but
utah
has
had
10
years
now
since
the
taft-hartley
act
was
in
effect
and
utah
hasn't
done
anything
about
it.
i
--
it'll
--
sees
that
the
utah
board
can
come
in
now
and
--
and
say
it
ought
to
have
that
power.
and
i
suppose
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
i
--
i
hope
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
in
the
time
i
have,
your
honor
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
--
i
wanted
to
refer
to
two
questions.
one
that
mr.
chief
justice
asked
with
respect
to
the
statutory
history.
and
mr.
callister
said
that
he
didn't
think
they
were
talking
about
when
they
said
borderline
industries,
talking
about
borderline
so
far
as
interstate
commerce
is
concerned.
now,
i
wanted
to
refer
the
court
to
the
report
of
both
the
senate
majority
and
minority
on
this
provision
because
that
is
where
this
provision
originated.
it
was
in
the
senate.
the
senate
majority
report
said
the
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
from
page
27
and
28
of
my
brief.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
right
at
the
bottom
of
page
27.
a
proviso
which
has
been
added
to
this
subsection
permits
the
national
board
to
allow
state
labor
relations
boards
to
take
final
jurisdiction
of
cases
in
borderline
industries,
for
instances,
borderline
insofar
as
interstate
commerce
is
concerned.
then
in
the
minority
report,
and
this
is
on
page
28
of
my
brief,
they
say
section
10
(a)
adds
a
proviso
to
the
present
act
empowering
the
board
to
concede
to
any
agency
of
any
state
or
territory
jurisdiction
over
any
cases
not
predominantly
national
in
character.
so
i
think
it's
very
clear
from
both
the
majority
and
the
minority
that
this
borderline
area
where
this
case
falls
is
the
type
of
case
they
are
talking
about
when
they
passed
10
(a),
that
they
wanted,
perhaps,
the
states
to
act
that
they
wanted
the
states
to
adopt
a
policy
similar
to
that
of
the
national
act.
the
other
thing
i
want
to
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
yes.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
that's
the
same
as
the
bethlehem
case.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
i
assume
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
yes.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
well,
i
assume,
your
honor,
that
they
were
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
and
i
can't
tell
from
reading
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
which
it
comes
on
the
bethlehem
if
there's
any
difference
in
the
facts
between
this
case
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
yes.
and
i
don't
know
why
they
did
it
that
way,
but
i
assume
they're
referring
to
the
problem
raised
in
your
honor's
concurring
opinion
in
that
case.
that's
the
only
reason
i
can
see.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
the
only
one
i've
been
able
to
find
in
this
committee
reports,
your
honor,
is
--
is
that
reference
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
--
in
the
minority
report.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
well
that,
i
wanted
to
point
that
out.
now,
the
other
--
i
think
it's
very
clear
that
congress
was
--
said
what
they
were
talking
about
here.
it's
not
like
as
in
the
other
cases
this
court
has
referred
to
where
they
said
--
had
said
with
respect
to
the
taft-hartley
act
that
congress
has
left
much
to
the
states
but
hasn't
said
how
much.
i
think
clearly
here,
congress
has
said
how
much
has
it
left
to
the
states.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
i'm
quoting
there,
your
honor,
from
this
court's
opinion
in
algoma.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
yes,
your
honor.
and
then
--
and
it
says
in
the
quote,
“see
the
house
report.”
mr.
peter
w.
billings
now,
i'm
not
sure
there
whether
the
house
report
expressly
refers
to
bethlehem
or
not,
but
this
court
indicated
i
thought
it
did,
i
gather
in
the
algoma
opinion.
now,
the
other
question
i
want
to
refer
to
was
the
one
that
mr.
justice
black
mentioned
might
be
a
good
argument.
that
is
that
this
--
this
was
a
rule
and
regulation
and
the
only
way
to
efficiently
operate
the
act
was
to
cut
down
on
--
so
as
to
meet
your
budget.
i
want
to
point
out
the
nature
of
these
yardsticks,
so
called.
no
one
really
hear
has
discussed
those.
the
brief
--
amicus
brief
of
the
steelworkers,
who
where
my
appellants
below
and
have
joined
me
here,
discussed
that
in
some
length
and
i
want
to
point
out
that
there,
it
is
said
that
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
they
--
they
joined
me
in
the
position
to
my
construction
of
10
(a),
your
honor.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
i
think
that
(inaudible)
anyone
would
quarrel
with
that.
but
i
think
the
call
of
congress
has
indicated
its
policy
that
those
predominantly
local
affairs
should
be
handled
on
the
same
idea
of
policy,
the
same
act,
the
same
relation
between
management
and
labor.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
i
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
i
think
that
it
might
give
a
little
more
substance
to
the
argument
that
this
is
pursuant
to
their
powers
to
make
rules
and
regulations.
all
i'm
saying
the
--
it
certainly
can't
be
that
here.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
in
my
brief,
no,
your
honor,
i
have
not.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
i
don't
think
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
well,
i
think
--
i
don't
think
it
need
be
in
the
--
in
the
decision
of
this
case
in
the
decision
of
what
10
(a)
means.
i
think
if
--
in
the
decision
--
a
determination
of
what
these
yardsticks
means,
it
could
very
well
do
so.
and
i've
cited
in
my
brief
three
circuit
court
cases
in
which
that
issue
was
raised
and
i
think
probably
this
court
will
be
faced
with
that
issue
in
one
of
those
three
cases.
i
--
i
cite
them
only
to
point
out
that
these
are
not
absolute,
these
yardsticks
and
that
courts
of
appeal
have
said
that
a
party
does
have
the
right
to
go
into
court
and
make
the
board
show
that
the
application
of
this
yardstick
is
a
reasonable
one
in
--
in
a
particular
case.
and
then
that
case,
as
i
say,
will
probably
be
here
eventually
but
i
don't
think
it's
presented
in
the
context
to
this
case.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
well,
the
only
thing
that
troubles
me
with
it,
your
honor,
is
the
word
“empowered”
in
10
(a)
instead
of
“directed”.
that
would
seem
to
leave
some
discretion
to
the
board
as
to
when
it
will
act.
i
don't
think
there's
any
discretion
as
to
when
the
national
act
applies.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
well,
i
--
i've
had
some
trouble
with
that
myself,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
peter
w.
billings
well,
i
--
as
i
say
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
well,
i
--
i
think
that
if
you
--
you
got
to
the
application
of
these
yardsticks
to
a
particular
case,
you
might
very
well
raise
the
question
of
whether
they
could
reasonably
refuse
to
hear
you
just
because
they
like
these
yardsticks
as
a
method
of
drawing
a
line.
i
think
i
can
go
that
far
to
talk
about
generalities.
i
don't
think
in
the
context
of
these
cases
i
could
anymore
than
to
say
the
word
“empowered”
troubles
me.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
i
would
guess
there
would
be.
i
haven't
seen
any
statistics
of
it,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
no,
i
have
not
agreed
with
the
utah
board.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
well,
that's
perfectly
true,
your
honor,
but
i
gather
that
--
and
so
far
as
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
is
concerned,
they
haven't
agreed
that
my
client
was
any
better
fellow
than
he
was
six
months
ago.
