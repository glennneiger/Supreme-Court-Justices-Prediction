justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
mr.
attorney
general
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
perhaps,
i
correctly
--
did
not
understand
you
correctly.
do
you
suggest
to
mr.
justice
black
that
if
in
fact
there
is
consistency
between
utah
and
federal
laws,
a
declination
by
the
federal
board
to
act
might
be
viewed
as
tantamount
to
a
session
for
the
purposes
of
10
(a)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
that
has
to
be
a
formal
session,
does
it
not?
it
provides
expressively.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
correct.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
attorney
general,
does
it
strange
that
congress
should
have
made
the
consistency
of
the
criteria
and
of
the
session
and
yet,
also,
contemplated
that
whether
or
not
there
was
consistency,
the
board
might
form
out
by
declinations
of
large
area
of
its
responsibility?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
let
me
see.
am
i
--
am
i
in
error
in
my
impression
that
there
may
not
be
any
formal
agreement
except
for
a
consistency
between
the
state,
the
federal
statutes
are
--
is
established?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
a
very
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
really
know
why
does
they
decline
jurisdiction
in
any
of
these
cases?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
then
however
inconsistent
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
left
the
statement,
remedies.
the
state
law
maybe
with
the
federal
trustee
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
that
case
is
formed
out.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
have
trouble
getting
over
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
my
difficulty
with
that
is,
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
it
is
not
unusual
for
at
least
the
local
regional
officers
to
refuse
to
take
a
case,
let's
say,
in
the
construction
industry
only
because
the
particular
employer
or
the
particular
controversy
doesn't
appeal
relevant
to
other
matters
pending
before
that
office,
he
--
like
the
kind
of
controversy
that
that
office
wants
to
give
its
time
to
investigate.
and
that
apparently
is
without
regard
for
whether
or
not
a
particular
industry
involved
like
the
construction
industry,
may
be
one
where
it
would
be
wise
for
the
board
to
resolve
all
controversies.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
looked
--
i
--
i'm
also
--
the
state
court's
being
able.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
difficulty
is
whether
this
statute
allows
us
to
say
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
because
the
alternative
may
have
to
be
that
the
board
has
to
act
and
may
be
mandamus
to
act.
