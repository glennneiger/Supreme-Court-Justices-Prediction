mr.
e.
r.
callister
chief
justice,
honorable
court.
i
agree
with
my
opponent
--
opposing
counsel
here
that
this
case
is
a
little
different
in
the
two
previously
presented.
here
in
this
case,
we
have
a
specific
refusal
by
the
--
the
national
board
to
proceed.
we
have
an
action
by
a
state
board
which
is
fully
consistent
with
the
federal
act.
and
thirdly,
we
have
a
comprehensive
labor
relations
statute
in
utah
which
almost
does
not
exactly
correspond
with
the
national
act.
it
does
provide
at
least
a
guarantee
of
the
basic
rights
provided
in
section
7
and
8
and
certainly,
was
consistent
with
the
national
act
in
the
instant
case.
in
that
regard,
i'd
like
to
read
if
i
may
from
the
decision
of
the
utah
supreme
court.
it
stated,
“in
the
present
case,
there
are
no
allegations
that
either
party
was
deprived
of
rights
which
it
might
have
obtained
under
the
federal
law
had
the
nlrb
heard
the
charges
presented
to
it.
there
are
in
fact,
no
intimations
that
the
national
board
would
have
disposed
of
the
matter
in
a
way
other
than
which
the
state
board
did.
no
subsidy
conflicts
between
the
provisions
of
the
taft-hartley
act
concerning
unfair
labor
practices
and
the
utah
code
have
been
alleged
nor
do
any
appear
with
reference
to
the
particular
charges
involved
here.
since
we
discovered
no
conflict
with
federal
authority
in
this
case
and
since
the
values
of
immediate
legal
supervision
of
labor
and
controversies
within
this
company
can
only
be
maintained
through
state
action.
we
hold
that
the
utah
state
labor
relations
board
had
jurisdiction
in
this
matter
and
affirmed
its
decision
in
order.”
now,
it
seems
from
listening
to
the
arguments
that
have
gone
on
today
relating
to
this
question
that
there's
a
particular
concern
about
section
10
(a)
of
the
federal
act
as
to
whether
or
not
that
prevents
the
national
board
from
declining
jurisdiction
in
particular
cases.
i
think
we
have
to
start
out
with
the
proposition
that
there's
a
presumption
in
favor
of
state
jurisdiction
in
the
absence
of
something
expressly
to
the
contrary
in
the
federal
act
or
in
the
federal
decisions.
assuming
that
presumption,
then
i
think
we
can
turn
to
cases
such
as
the
welch
versus
new
hampshire,
northwest
telephone
versus
nebraska,
missouri
railway
versus
larabee.
in
those
cases,
there
you
had
a
federal
law,
another
federal
administrative
body,
empowered
and
directed
in
some
cases
to
institute
rules
of
procedure
and
so
forth.
however,
in
these
cases,
the
federal
administrative
body
did
not
take
affirmative
action
in
--
at
the
time
these
cases
arose
in
designating
the
various
rights
or
rules
and
so
forth.
and
it
was
held
in
all
of
those
cases
that
where
the
federal
government
has
created
administrative
bodies
which
could
take
care
of
these
matters
by
regulation
or
otherwise
but
have
not,
then
the
state's
jurisdiction
applied.
as
you
recall
in
the
welch
case,
that
involved
the
interstate
commerce
commission
which
was
authorized
to
promulgate
rules
relating
to
the
length
of
hours
which
a
truck
driver
might
drive.
new
hampshire
had
a
state
law
but
i
think
allowing
him
to
drive
for
12
hours,
and
the
icc
came
along
with
the
regulation
for
eight
hours.
but
before
that
went
into
effect,
the
court
held
that
the
state
laws
applied.
now,
it
concerns
me
about
this
“no
man's
land”
as
they
termed
it
because
of
the
economic
impact,
i
think
that
a
decision
as
advocated
by
my
opponent
would
follow.
as
pointed
out
in
the
amicus
curiae
brief
of
the
state
of
new
york,
over
90%
of
the
businesses
in
the
united
states
have
less
than
20
employees.
as
a
consequence,
it
would
be
an
almost
impossible
task,
i
believe,
for
the
national
board
with
its
limited
resources
and
personnel
to
handle
each
and
every
case
that
might
arise
in
this
field.
the
proper
place
for
it,
i
think,
is
with
the
state.
and
certainly,
the
mere
fact
that
the
state
law
might
differ
from
the
national
act
is
no
argument
against
to
permitting
them
to
act
when
the
federal
government
declines
to
act
because
i
think
some
regulation
is
better
than
none
at
all.
if
our
adversaries
are
correct,
you're
going
to
have
a
law
of
the
jungle
when
it
--
it
applies
to
these
“no
man
land”
cases.
the
federal
government
won't
act
and
the
state
can't
act.
mr.
e.
r.
callister
well,
there,
justice
black,
it's
admitted
that
there
has
not
been
one
agreement
entered
into
under
section
10
(a)
because
of
its
qualifying
provisions.
mr.
e.
r.
callister
the
provisions
to
the
effect
that
the
state
laws
and
the
interpretations
thereof
must
be
consistent
with
the
federal.
mr.
e.
r.
callister
utah's
law,
as
i
pointed
out
justice
black,
is
consistent
--
somewhat
consistent
in
--
in
relation
to
this
particular
case
before.
it's
the
unfair
labor
practices
act.
in
other
aspects,
the
utah
act
does
not
conform
to
the
national
act.
utah's
act
didn't
conform
in
almost
identical
words
and
so
forth
with
the
wagner
act.
mr.
e.
r.
callister
that
is
correct.
mr.
e.
r.
callister
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
i
am
trying
to
admit
that
that
in
my
opinion
is
the
nub
of
this
--
this
controversy.
if
i
could
say
this
case
is
distinguishable
and
that
there
is
no
possibility
in
this
case,
particular
case
of
a
conflict
with
the
federal
law,
still,
it's
the
position
of
the
adversary,
my
adversary,
that
even
though
it's
consistent
in
as
much
as
there
was
no
session
agreement
entered
into
--
mr.
e.
r.
callister
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
r.
callister
well,
that
--
that
--
mr.
e.
r.
callister
yes,
that's
right,
your
honor.
i
stand
to
be
corrected.
mr.
e.
r.
callister
no,
your
--
mr.
e.
r.
callister
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
r.
callister
no,
no,
you
misunderstood
me.
mr.
e.
r.
callister
i
say
that's
the
position
of
my
opponent
that
even
though
the
utah
lack
--
law
is
consistent,
it
cannot
act
or
take
jurisdiction
without
the
formal
agreement
--
mr.
e.
r.
callister
--
between
the
session.
mr.
e.
r.
callister
that's
right.
mr.
e.
r.
callister
i
would
assume
so,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
r.
callister
right.
but
it's
our
contention
that
10
(a)
does
not
apply
to
these
cases
where
you
have
a
declination
by
the
board
of
jurisdiction.
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
welch
case,
there
you
had
a
board
empowered
to
act
but
it
hadn't
acted
as
yet,
so
the
court
let
the
state
take
jurisdiction
enforce
its
laws.
and
it
seems
to
me
here
where
you
have
a
board
who
--
which
is
empowered
to
act
and
it
declines
to
act,
i
think
that's
a
much
stronger
case
than
when
it
--
it
just
hasn't
gotten
around
to
acting
as
yet.
mr.
e.
r.
callister
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
r.
callister
that's
correct.
in
the
--
mr.
e.
r.
callister
i
think
this
position
is
even
stronger
because
here,
the
board
has
declined
absolutely.
it's
not
a
case
of
where
it
hadn't
gotten
around
to
acting.
it
just
says
we
are
not
going
to
act
in
this
certain
area.
mr.
e.
r.
callister
under
the
board's
--
mr.
e.
r.
callister
--
jurisdictional
yardsticks?
i
think
so
with
as
much
certainty
as
you
can
get.
i
mean
it's
--
they
--
they
come
along
and
makes
--
mr.
e.
r.
callister
[laughs]
well,
they
come
along
and
they
say,
the
certain
amount
of
inflow
or
outflow
in
dollars
and
cents
worth
of
business
either
put
you
under
the
federal
act
or
leaves
you
out
of
it.
now
of
course,
in
my
opinion,
that's
a
better
guide
post
than
these
phrases
like
affecting
interstate
commerce
or
an
indirect
effect
and
so
forth.
mr.
e.
r.
callister
no,
but
it's
a
convenient
yardstick.
mr.
e.
r.
callister
well,
they
--
mr.
e.
r.
callister
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
at
least
they
are
spelled
out
with
some
particularity
in
their
rules
and
regulations.
mr.
e.
r.
callister
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
getting
--
mr.
e.
r.
callister
well,
i
also
--
pardon
me,
your
honor.
i
also
based
it
upon
this
too.
mr.
e.
r.
callister
but
further
than
that,
i
think
by
reading
the
language
of
section
10
(a),
you
can
also
reach
the
conclusion
that
congress
didn't
intend
to
prohibit
the
national
board
from
declining
jurisdiction
in
such
cases.
the
word
“empowered”
is
used
throughout
that
section.
the
board
is
empowered
to
prevent
unfair
labor
practices.
it
is
empowered
to
enter
into
the
session
agreements.
the
word
“direct”
is
not
used.
now
another
thing,
at
the
time
--
well,
since
the
inception
of
our
labor
relations
act
in
1935
and
subsequent,
the
board
has
consistently
declined
to
exercise
jurisdiction
in
--
in
certain
cases,
the
small
cases
in
which
they
felt
that
no
substantial
interest
as
far
as
commerce
was
concerned
was
affected.
they've
done
that
continuously
and
it's
true
that
at
the
outset,
they
did
it
on
a
case-to-case
basis.
now,
this
court,
in
the
bethlehem
case,
certainly
was
aware
that
there
was
this
particular
type
of
the
case
where
the
board
had
declined
to
exercise
jurisdiction
for
budgetary
or
other
reasons.
mr.
e.
r.
callister
that's
correct.
mr.
e.
r.
callister
that's
what
i'm
getting
to,
your
honor.
so
it
--
mr.
e.
r.
callister
well,
i
don't
think
they
had
to.
here
is
the
situation.
you
have
--
you
had
two
distinct
matters
under
consideration
there
in
the
bethlehem
case
in
my
opinion.
you
have
the
case
that
was
before
you
at
that
time
regarding
the
--
the
certifying
of
the
foremen's
union.
and
there
it
was
held
that
the
board's
declination
of
jurisdiction
in
that
particular
field
was
because
its
declination
was
in
the
nature
of
a
decision
and
then
you
reserved
the
question
of
declination
for
budgetary
reasons.
now,
congress
had
that
decision
before
it
when
it
enacted
10
(a).
now,
i
think
if
you
read
that
act,
it
says,
“provided
that
the
board
is
empowered
by
agreement
with
any
agency
of
any
state
or
territory
to
cede
such
agency
jurisdiction
over
any
cases
in
any
industry.”
now,
they
are
speaking
more
than
just
to
these
cases
that
were
declined
because
of
budgetary
reasons.
under
the
language
of
this
proviso,
the
board
concedes
its
jurisdiction
to
a
state
agency
on
any
case
regardless
of
the
effect
that
the
particular
case
might
have
on
interstate
commerce.
there's
no
restriction
here
except
for
these
limited
few
such
as
mining,
manufacturing
and
so
forth
where
they
say
there
that
they
can
only
cede
jurisdiction
when
it's
predominantly
of
a
local
character.
now,
in
my
opinion,
that
exception
that
is
put
in
here
relating
to
mining
and
manufacturing
and
transportation
and
so
forth
indicates,
at
least
to
me,
that
the
intent
of
congress
was
not
to
be
regulating
or
doing
away
with
the
powers
of
the
states
to
act
where
the
board
had
declined
jurisdiction
but
on
the
contrary.
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
recognition
of
them.
here,
they're
granting
to
the
states,
providing
the
states,
don't
have
inconsistent
laws
and
so
forth.
they're
providing
here
that
they
concede
their
jurisdiction
in
any
case.
now,
i
also
believe
that
--
that
this
10
(a)
provision
has
given
the
interpretation
advocated
by
--
by
--
mr.
e.
r.
callister
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
r.
callister
well
--
mr.
e.
r.
callister
yes.
i'll
have
to
confess
that
as
far
as
the
legislative
history
of
this
particular
provision
is
concerned,
it's
very
unsatisfactory
i
think
from
both
sides.
but
under
that
quoted
committee
report,
it
was
referred
to
in
the
case
previously.
it
spoke
of
borderline
cases
that
this
was
designed
to
take
care
of
borderline
cases.
i
don't
--
can't
tell
from
the
legislative
history
or
from
that
excerpt
that
borderline
cases
met
the
small
cases
that
--
cases
that
were
declined
because
of
budgetary
reasons.
a
borderline
case
is
a
case
not
--
not
like
you
had
in
the
bethlehem
case.
a
borderline
case
doesn't
mean
its
borderline
because
the
amount
is
particularly
smaller,
it
falls
below
the
standards
or
because
the
board
has
declined
jurisdiction
for
budgetary
reasons.
mr.
e.
r.
callister
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
at
the
time,
i'd
say
the
section
10
(a)
was
written
into
it,
the
board
had
consistently
up
to
that
time
declined
jurisdiction
for
budgetary
reasons.
at
that
time,
it
was
on
a
case-to-case
basis
however.
another
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
--
mr.
e.
r.
callister
i
don't
know
that,
your
honor,
whether
they've
asked
for
a
change
in
this
or
not.
mr.
e.
r.
callister
well,
there
have
been
several
amendments
proposed.
i'm
aware
of
that,
your
honor.
but
as
to
whether
or
not
the
board
has
requested
a
change,
i'm
afraid
i
just
don't
know
if
that
isn't
--
mr.
e.
r.
callister
[laughs]
i'll
agree
with
you
there.
now,
10
(a),
as
i
was
going
to
state,
had
given
the
interpretation
advocated
by
the
adversary.
it
would
rule
out,
in
my
judgment,
state
court
action.
and
i
just
can't
conceive
that
congress
would
intend
to
rule
out
state
court
action.
in
it
--
just
as
much
as
i
cannot
conceive
that
congress
intended
that
their
biggest
area
where
no
law
would
apply
at
all,
state
or
federal.
mr.
e.
r.
callister
well,
i
agree.
in
the
particularly
--
and
that's
particularly
true
here
because
--
mr.
e.
r.
callister
--
this
proviso
--
this
proviso
was
adopted.
that
is
without
any
extended
hearings.
i
mean
it
was
--
resulted
here
in
bethlehem
case
and
that
was
--
i
think
it
was
--
mr.
e.
r.
callister
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
so.
as
i
tried
to
point
out
in
10
(a),
the
board
is
given
the
right
to
cede
jurisdiction
in
any
case
in
any
industry
with
the
exception
that
that
one
little
word
--
mr.
e.
r.
callister
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
e.
r.
callister
that's
right,
your
honor.
well,
now
--
mr.
e.
r.
callister
--
but
they
have
set
up
these
yardsticks
and
have
declined
jurisdiction
in
these
cases
which
fall
outside
the
limits.
in
other
words,
the
case
in
which
--
mr.
e.
r.
callister
i
think
i
do,
your
honor.
it's
because
of
budgetary
reasons
and
lack
of
personnel
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
have
to
process
everyone
of
these,
i
think
it
would
be
--
mr.
e.
r.
callister
that's
right.
mr.
e.
r.
callister
that's
correct.
but
--
mr.
e.
r.
callister
yes.
mr.
e.
r.
callister
well,
i
don't
blame
you.
but
here
like
i
say,
if
the
board
entered
into
a
formal
session
agreement,
well
it's
like
to
say
it
can,
covering
any
case
in
any
industry,
it
would
be
a
case
it
seems
to
me
where
consistency
would
be
required
because
the
industry
in
that
case
would
be
affecting
interstate
commerce
to
a
substantial
degree.
now
here,
they
have
determined
that
the
industries
that
fall
outside
of
this
limit
set
by
the
yardstick,
they
have
determined
that
that
type
of
industry
does
not
affect
commerce
--
commerce
to
any
substantial
degree.
mr.
e.
r.
callister
like
the
--
mr.
e.
r.
callister
no,
no.
i
don't
think
you're
wrong
about
that,
but
i
do
think
this.
what
we
have
here,
if
--
if
the
state
boards
or
the
state
courts
can't
act
--
first
of
all,
you
have
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
board
can
decline
jurisdiction.
mr.
e.
r.
callister
fine.
mr.
e.
r.
callister
well,
i
think
under
--
i
like
to
say,
first
of
all,
you
have
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
national
board
can
decline
to
exercises
its
jurisdiction.
and
that
i
think
it
can
by
the
very
wording
of
the
statute
and
i
think
this
court,
inferentially
at
least
in
the
denver
building
trades
case,
came
to
that
conclusion.
so,
once
establishing
that
the
board
can
decline
jurisdiction
for
this
budgetary
reasons
then
if
the
state
court
or
the
state
boards
can't
act,
then
there's
no
law
that
would
apply.
and
i
can't
believe
that
that's
consistent
with
the
national
policy
as
set
forth
in
the
act
or
stated
by
congress.
mr.
e.
r.
callister
well,
there
we
come
to
another
reason
why
i
think
that
congress
didn't
intend
to
apply
to
this
--
section
10
(a)
to
these
situations
because
congress
certainly,
we
ask
to
be
charged
with
the
knowledge
of
what
has
been
happening.
and
if
they
felt
that
this
national
board
had
to
act
in
every
one
of
these
cases,
certainly,
the
appropriations
for
the
national
board
and
the
personnel
would
have
been
enlarged.
mr.
e.
r.
callister
well,
i
still
think,
however,
it's
an
indication
as
i
said
--
mr.
e.
r.
callister
that's
right.
mr.
e.
r.
callister
20
employees.
mr.
e.
r.
callister
i
have
not,
your
honor.
but
i
would
assume
--
i
mean,
we're
just
trying
--
this
is
in
the
new
york's
brief
and
it
--
mr.
e.
r.
callister
--
kind
of
opened
my
eyes
when
i
read
but
--
mr.
e.
r.
callister
--
i
think
you
could
correlate
pretty
closely,
i
mean,
the
number
of
employees
as
to
the
volume
of
business
done.
i
mean
there
would
be
somewhat
of
an
analogy
between
the
two.
mr.
e.
r.
callister
that
i
do
not.
i
know
they
haven't
been
given
them.
mr.
e.
r.
callister
i
imagine
being
a
typical
board
that
they'll
probably
ask
for
a
lot
more
than
we
get.
mr.
e.
r.
callister
[laughs]
well,
thank
you.
mr.
e.
r.
callister
yes.
mr.
e.
r.
callister
i
say,
your
honor,
in
my
brief
that
for
budgetary
reasons
that
that's
what
the
board
majority
at
least
said
in
its
press
release.
i
gather
from
reading
mr.
murdock's
opinion
in
the
breeding
transfer
case
that
he
felt
that
there
are
political
aspects
to
this
program
that
the
board
wanted
the
states
to
take
hold
and
they
thought
they
could
do
it
this
way
where
congress
had
prohibited
them
from
doing
it
by
expressed
agreement.
i
