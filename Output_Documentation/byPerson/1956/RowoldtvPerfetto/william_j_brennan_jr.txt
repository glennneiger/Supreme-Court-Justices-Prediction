justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
this,
mr.
rein,
before
you
leave
it.
you
suggested
that
he
was
merely
a
salesman
and
you
did
that
once
or
twice
in
the
statement.
say,
"i
was
kind
of
a
salesman
in
there,
but
what
about
--
the
only
active
work
i
did
was
running
the
book
store."
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
rather
read
that
latter
--
last
as
meaning
merely
that
he
was
in
charge
but
on
behalf
of
the
communist
party.
at
least
isn't
that
a
possible
inference?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
only
difference
though
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
running
the
bookstore
for
a
while
rather
has
a
literally
understood
meaning,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
petition
in
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
there's
been
also
exclude
even
voluntary
membership
if
it's
for
the
purposes
of
obtaining
employment,
food
rations.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
date
of
the
findings?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
it
precede
this
for
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
regulation
followed
the
actual
hearing,
did
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and,
of
course,
this
statement
of
his
was
several
years
earlier,
the
sworn
statement.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
january
10,
1947?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
saying
this
to
us,
mr.
imlay,
that
actually
in
speaking
of
voluntarily
joining
for
purposes
of
obtaining
employment,
it
must
be
in
the
sense
of
a
compulsion
from
desperation
for
need
of
a
job
or
for
a
need
of
food
so
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
while
it
says
voluntary
and
actual
intent
but
was
contemplated
was
involuntary
because
done
under
those
compulsions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
where
--
where
do
you
say
we'll
find
that
that
was
the
intention
of
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
you
get
to
there,
mr.
imlay,
and
leave
this
regulation,
may
i
ask
you
this?
did
i
understand
you
to
answer
mr.
justice
burton
that
iii
has
to
be
limited
to
--
to
those
who
had
become
members
in
foreign
lands
in
circumstances
where
however
great
their
need
for
food
or
employment,
they
could
not
have
either
food
or
employment
without
becoming
members
of
the
communist
party
and
that
that's
the
significance
of
the
last
phrase
and
where
necessary
for
such
purposes?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
i
understood
the
background
of
it
though,
as
you
just
outlined
it
for
us,
in
many
other
nations
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
where
notwithstanding
the
distress
from
one
of
employment
or
food
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
was
not
available,
neither
employment
nor
food
except
as
the
individual
became
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
is
that
what
you
told
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
--
let's
take
--
let's
take
the
situation
of
an
american,
this
very
petition.
now,
suppose
in
fact
this
statement
of
his
is
to
be
read
as
indicating
that
he,
individually,
suffered
such
distress
from
one
of
employment
or
for
food.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
he
felt
the
only
way
he
was
going
to
get
either
was
by
joining
the
communist
party.
now,
if
that's
what
the
record
supported,
do
you
think
his
membership
would
--
would
be
within
iii-exception?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that's
--
he
viewed
that
he
couldn't
get
either
food
or
employment
as
he
experienced
it
in
any
event,
in
any
way,
and
he
finally
thought
in
desperation,
"well,
perhaps,
if
i
join
this
party,
maybe
something
will
be
done
from."
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
then
it
come
within
iii?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
imlay,
do
you
go
this
far
that
if
these
activities
for
jobs
and
food
were
for
people
generally,
that
is
for
benevolent
motives
and
not
from
selfish
motives
because
he
firstly
need
it,
would
it
be
the
government's
case
that
--
that
of
itself
establishes
on
this
record
more
than
nominal
membership
without
reference
to
the
activity
of
the
bookstore?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
my
--
my
premise
is
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
he
joined
to
further
not
his
own
selfish
interests
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
but
the
interest
of
people
generally.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
after
joining,
he
did
the
things
that
he
says
he
did
in
going
to
the
courthouse
and
that
kind
of
thing.
with
those
admitted
activities,
without
reference
to
the
activity
in
running
the
bookstore
so-called,
be
sufficient
to
take
him
out
of
your
concept
of
mere
nominal
membership.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
which
is
then
to
say
if
that's
what
he
did,
as
you
read
the
statute,
then
he
was
a
member.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
admitting
that
they
did
that
then,
they
cannot
contend
that
the
membership
was
merely
nominal.
