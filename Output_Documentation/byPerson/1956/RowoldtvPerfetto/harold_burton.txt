do
you
have
something
to
show
that
this

that
class
iii
was
referring
strictly
to
such
kind
of
compulsion
to
get
food
that
they
had
abroad
rather
than
in
this
country?
justice
harold
burton
that
means
a
situation
where
you
had
to
show
that
you
were
a
member
of
the
communist
party
in
order
to
get
your
ration.
justice

while

of
the
communist
party,
you
--
that
didn't
help
to

mr.
imlay,
in
going
back
to
the
section
1,
i'm
--
i
don't
just
understand.
the
attorney
general
was
directed
to
provide
by
regulations,
what
--
what
was
the
purpose
of
having
the
regulations
there?
does
the
history
show
anything
on
that?
justice
harold
burton
the
--
the
regulation
merely
parrots
the
act,
does
it
not?
justice
harold
burton
well,
then,
what
did
the
--
what
did
the
attorney
general
do
in
--
why
--
why
was
he
asked
to
give
a
regulation
that
was
exactly
the
same
as
the
act?
the
act
--
justice
harold

decide
that,
wouldn't
it?

voluntarily
--
justice
harold
burton
and
that
is
to
obtain
their
purposes
through
the
medium
of
the
communist
party.
justice
harold
burton
well,
do
you
--
do
you
say
that
if
the
only
proof
before
the
examiner
was
that
this
man
was
what
--
what
used
to
be
called
a
card-carrying
communist,
would
that
be
--
not
be
enough?

burton
(voice

--
justice
harold
burton
--
there
was
no
evidence
at
all
except
proof
on
that
part
was
issued
to
him
and
he
became
a
member
as
a
card-carrying
communist,
there's
nothing
else.

there's
nothing

the
issuance
to
him
when
he
became
a

would
be
your
