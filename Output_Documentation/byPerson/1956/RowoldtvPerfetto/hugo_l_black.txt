you
say
that
wasn't

justice
hugo

may
i
ask
you
what
you
understood
this
minute,
i'm
not
in
it.
i'm
not
very
strong
in
galvan
about
the
technical
--
my
understanding.
well,
i
can't
--
in
the
galvan
case,
it
said
this.
but
it
seems
to
me
to
be
inconsistent
with
the
arguments
you
are
making
now
after
stating
that
the
statute
made
present
a
former
membership
in
the
communist
party
in
and
of
itself
to
grant
a
deportation.
the
courts
opinion
said,
"certainly,
we
cannot
say
that
this
classification
by
congress
as
to
a
basis
as
to
be
violative
of
due
process
and
therefore
beyond
the
power
of
congress."

assuming
at
one
thought
that
nominal
consequence

justice
hugo
l.
black
--
such
as
what's
mentioned
in
the
galvan
case
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
was
to
be
interpreted
according
to
the
statement
of
senator
ferguson,
that
is
it
was
a
communist
by
conviction,
one
who
is
a
mentally
communist.
justice
hugo
l.
black
assuming
that
that
were
proper
meaning
to
be
given
the
word
"nominal
communist",
has
there
been
any
finding
to
the
effect
that
he
was
a
communist
by
conviction
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
devoted
to

but
was
there
any
definition
of
what
the
fact
finder
thought
would
be
a
member
within
the
meaning
of
the
act?
justice
hugo

that
excludes
coerced
membership.
justice
hugo
l.

well,
you
mean
--
you
mean
--
you
think
if
the
evidence
justifies
holding,
then
it's
not
the
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
being
true,
i
cannot
yet
see
whether
that
issue
has
ever
been
fairly
faced
by
the
time
to
effect
or
where
has
found
against
this
man
on
the
question
which
he
apparently
raised
from
the
beginning.
justice

certainly,
it's
not
done
so
specifically
if
i'm

you
take
one
statement
about
burden

proof
that
i
would
like
to
have
you
explain.
justice

if
--
if
membership
of
a
certain
kind
is
required
to
prove
the
case
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
against
(inaudible),
whose
burden
is
to
prove
that
particular
kind
of
membership?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
show
that
he
was
the
kind
of
member
that
made
him
subject
to
deportation
--
justice
hugo

--
or
to
--
to
exclusion,
whatever
it
is.
justice

to
show
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
kind
of
membership?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
kind
of
membership
defined
in
your
regulation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
burden
on
the
government.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
wouldn't
claim
that
--
justice
hugo

black
--
had
to
be
shifted
to
alien
(voice

justice
hugo

so
that
he
was
a
kind
of
membership
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
kind
of
member
that
the
act
prescribed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
whether
administrative
or
not,
i
suppose
that
such
a
man
was
very
light
to
the
effect
that
he
had
stated
certain
or
some
burden
resting
on
the
government.
he
can't

it

by

(voice

administrative
agencies.
justice
hugo
l.
black
after
he'd
shown
enough
to
show
that
he's
a
kind
of
membership
that
justifies
exclusion
then,
of
course,
the
burden
is
met.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
is
that
what
you
mean?
justice
hugo
l.
black
certainly.
i'm
not
talking
about
defense
but
does
it
have
the
duty
or
the
burden
of
showing
that
he
come
to

within
the
class
that
can
be
deported
or
excluded
by
reason
of
the
existence
of
the
facts
they
attempted
to
establish.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
other
separate
defenses
or
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
it,
you
say
that
membership,
according
to
the
regulations
on
the
act,
is
not
enough.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
all
right.
and
--
and
he
--
justice
hugo

that

that
he's
not
a
mere
nominal
member.

do
you
get
away
from
mr.

question
