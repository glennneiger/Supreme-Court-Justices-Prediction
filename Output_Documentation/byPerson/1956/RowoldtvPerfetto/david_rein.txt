mr.
david
rein
yes.
if
the
court
please,
petitioner
in
this
case
is
a
72-year
old
alien,
a
native
of
germany.
he
was
admitted
to
this
country
for
permanent
residence
back
in
1914
and
he
has
resided
here
ever
since.
he
was
ordered
deported
under
the
provisions
of
the
internal
security
act
of
1950,
which
provides
for
the
deportation
of
aliens
who
are
former
members
of
the
communist
party.
a
finding
made
by
the
immigration
service
in
this
case
was
that
the
alien
here
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
for
about
six
months
in
1935.
this
finding
of
membership
was
based
entirely
upon
a
voluntary
statement
which
was
made
by
the
petitioner
under
oath
to
an
officer
of
the
immigration
service
back
in
january
of
1947.
that
statement
is
set
out
in
the
record
at
pages
25
to
32.
and
we
have
reproduced
all
the
relevant
portions
of
that
statement
in
our
brief
from
pages
401.
i
wish
at
this
time
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
the
most
prevalent
portions
of
that
statement
which
will
come
up
in
--
across
my
argument.
on
page
5,
the
question
was
put
to
the
alien,
“what
was
the
purpose
of
your
joining
the
communist
party?”
answer,
“the
purpose
was
probably
this,
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
came
hand
in
hand,
the
communist
party
and
the
fight
for
bread.”
mr.
david
rein
i'm
reading
from
page
5
of
my
brief.
mr.
david
rein
sorry,
it's
--
it
appears
at
the
record
on
page
25
and
i'm
reading
from
my
brief
at
this
time.
it
seemed
to
me
like
this.
let's
put
it
this
way
that
the
communist
party
and
the
workers'
alliance
had
one
aim,
to
get
something
to
eat
for
the
people.
turning
then
to
the
brief
on
page
78,
the
following
appears.
question,
“were
you
an
active
worker
in
the
communist
party?”
answer
--
mr.
david
rein
page
7
of
my
brief,
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
“were
you
an
active
worker
in
the
communist
party?”
answer,
“the
only
active
work
i
did
was
running
the
bookstore
for
a
while.”
question,
“where
did
you
run
a
bookstore?”
answer,
“241
market
in
minneapolis.”
question,
“what
sort
of
bookstore
was
it?”
answer,
“oh,
all
kinds
of
literature,
all
kinds
of
writers
in
the
whole
world.
strachey,
marx,
lenin's
writing
and
others.
socialism
and
all
that
stuff.”
question,
“did
you
own
the
bookstore?”
answer,
“no.
i
didn't
get
a
penny
there.”
question,
“what
was
the
arrangement
there?”
answer,
“i
was
kind
of
a
salesman
in
there,
but
the
communist
party
ran
it.”
question,
“you
secure
this
employment
through
your
membership
in
the
communist
party?”
answer,
“yes.”
question,
“was
this
store
an
official
outlet
for
communist
literature?”
and
then
finally,
turning
to
page
10
of
our
brief,
i
wish
to
read
the
following
excerpt.
question,
“again
referring
to
your
joining
in
the
communist
party
in
1935,
was
this
motivated
by
dissatisfaction
in
living
under
a
democracy?”
answer,
“no,
not
by
that,
just
a
matter
of
having
no
jobs
at
that
time.
everybody
around
me
had
the
idea
that
we
had
to
fight
for
something
to
eat
and
clothes
and
shelter.
we
were
not
thinking
then,
anyways,
the
fellows
around
me
of
overthrowing
anything.
we
wanted
something
to
eat
and
something
to
crawl
into."
question,
“you
say,
fight
for
something
to
eat
and
crawl
into.
what
do
you
mean
by
that
term?”
answer,
“we
had
to
go
and
ask
those
who
had
it,
that
was
the
courthouse
at
that
time.
we
petitioned
city,
state
and
national
government.
we
did
and
we
succeeded.we
finally
got
unemployment
laws
and
a
certain
budget.
even
at
the
few
communist
meetings
i
attended,
nothing
was
ever
said
about
overthrowing
anything.
all
they
talked
about
was
fighting
for
the
daily
needs.
that
is
why
we
never
thought
much
of
joining
those
parties
in
these
days
--
in
those
days."
two
questions
are
presented
by
this
case,
set
out
in
the
statement
of
questions
presented.
the
first
is
whether
under
the
evidence
here,
the
petitioner
was
more
than
a
nominal
membership
--
member
of
the
communist
party,
and
whether
since
under
our
contention,
we
argue
he
was
no
more
than
a
nominal
member.
he
comes
within
the
deportation
statute
of
1950,
as
the
term
"member"
was
defined
in
galvan.
and
the
second
question
is
whether
the
provision
of
the
internal
security
act
of
1950,
which
was
relied
upon
here
by
the
deportation
service
is
constitutional
despite
the
decision
of
this
court
in
galvan
which
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
that
act.
mr.
david
rein
that's
true.
and
we
make
no
distinctions
for
galvan.
we
are
expressly
asking
that
to
be
overruled.
mr.
david
rein
i'm
sorry.
mr.
david
rein
we
make
--
we
make
no
distinction
in
galvan
on
the
issue
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
mr.
david
rein
we
do
make
a
distinction
on
the
definition
of
the
issue
of
nominal
membership.
we
think
on
--
mr.
david
rein
--
that
issue
the
case
is
entirely
different,
i
guess.
we
do
not
ask
you
to
overrule
galvan
in
that
respect.
we
ask
you
to
overrule
galvan
only
insofar
as
galvan
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
the
act.
we
think
on
the
issue
to
which
i'm
going
to
address
myself
now,
the
issue
of
nominal
membership,
we
believe
that
galvan
has
authority
in
our
favor
and
would
require
a
reversal
of
the
deportation
order.
the
galvan
case,
which
was
the
case
sustaining
the
constitutionality
of
this
provision,
construe
the
statute
as
not
applying
to
former
members
of
the
communist
party
who
had
been
only
nominal
members.
the
court
gives
no
precise
definition
to
that
term.
i
gather
because
in
the
experience
of
the
legislative
history
or
previous
decisions
of
courts,
no
precise
definition
was
available.
it
referred
essentially
to
the
legislative
history
of
a
provision
which
was
enacted
in
1951
at
which
time
congress
passed
in
clarifying
of
--
the
clarifying
act
as
to
the
meaning
of
member
as
used
in
the
act
of
1950.
galvan
established
at
least
these
propositions
clearly.
one,
it
is
not
necessary
to
fall
within
the
orbit
of
the
1950
act
that
the
alien
have
knowledge
of
the
communist
party's
alleged
advocacy
of
violence.
it
is
necessary
however
that
he
has
some
awareness
of
the
platform
and
purposes
of
the
party.
he
must
be
aware
that
the
organization
he
has
joined
is
known
as
the
communist
party
which
operates
as
a
distinct
and
active
political
organization,
and
his
relationship
with
the
organization
must
be
of
a
character
that
you
could
characterize
it
as
more
than
nominal.
the
guide
post
was
the
legislative
debate,
and
the
only
guide
post
referred
to
in
galvan
was
the
legislative
debate
in
1951
revolving
around
the
clarifying
provision
with
regards
to
the
meaning
of
the
term
member.
that
act
was
introduced,
at
least
that
clarifying
amendment
was
introduced
by
congress
because
of
devoid
of
the
original
office
of
the
internal
security
act
to
senator
mccarran
and
congressman
walter.
but
the
attorney
general
had
been
applying
the
term
member
wrongfully
as
applying
to
every
kind
of
member.
and
they
felt
that
not
only
do
they
not
issue
to
be
so
applied
but
they
stated
in
the
cross
of
the
debate
that
had
never
been
to
their
attention,
that
it
--
that
it
should
be
so
applied.
the
clarifying
amendment
expressly
provided
that
the
statute
will
not
cover
those
who
had
joined
the
communist
party
when
they
were
children
or
they
became
members
by
operation
of
law
or
to
obtain
the
necessities
of
life.
this
court's
opinion
recognized
however,
that
these
three
categories
of
nominal
membership
were
not
the
sole
categories
of
nominal
membership
intended
by
congress
and
that
there
could
be
other
instances
of
nominal
membership.
the
government
recognized
it
isn't
well
in
its
brief
and
it
recognizes
the
force
of
galvan
in
creating
the
caveat
as
to
the
nature
of
membership.
it
suggests,
that
is
the
base
to
point
out,
the
meaning
of
that
caveat
to
refer
more
fully
to
the
senate
debate.
we
agree
with
him
in
that,
but
we
think
here,
we
will
find
that
the
debate
is
somewhat
confusing.
it
is
not
in
itself
too
clear
a
guide
because
different
senators
said
not
really
different
things
but
somewhat
vague
things.
we
suggest
and
we
believe
properly
so
that
the
language
are
set
forth
on
page
25
of
the
government's
brief
and
the
quotation
from
senator
ferguson
is
as
good
a
guide
as
there
might
be
to
what
congress
had
in
mind.
senator
ferguson
incidentally
was
one
of
the
senators
who
introduced
an
amendment
to
this
clarifying
amendment.
the
amendment
originally
introduced
by
senator
mccarran,
were
not
have
applied
to
members
of
so-called
communist
organizations
but
only
the
fascists
and
nazi
organizations.
senator
ferguson
suggested
that
the
amendment
apply
to
members
of
any
kind
of
organization
that
came
within
the
terms
of
the
1950
act.
senator
ferguson
in
giving
what
he
had
in
mind
said
as
follows
at
page
25.
mr.
ferguson,
“that
is
correct.
the
amendment
would
exclude
all
those
who
were
communist
by
conviction,
what
we
might
call
mentally
communist.
but
it
would
not
exclude
those
who
really
in
effect
never
have
been
what
i
call
mentally
communist.
those
who's
communist
affiliation
was
nominal
or
involuntarily.
“thus
clearly,
so
far
as
senator
ferguson
was
concerned,
the
attachment
to
the
communist
party
must
be
something
more
than
just
membership.
there
must
be
at
least
some
mental
indication
of
the
individual's
beliefs.
the
same
language
as
appears
also
at
the
same
volume
of
the
congressional
record
at
page
2387.
again
what
senator
ferguson
said,
“when
we
change
the
statute
here
today,
we
are
not
changing
it
as
to
people
who
were
fascists,
nazis,
communists
or
totalitarians
by
virtue
of
their
convictions,
and
what
i
have
refer
to
as
their
mental
processes.
we
are
changing
it
only
as
to
those
persons
who
never
walk
mentally
or
psychologically,
fascists,
nazis,
communists,
or
totalitarians,
or
any
stripe,
or
any
color.“
similarly,
congressman
walter,
who
was
the
author
of
the
clarifying
provision
on
the
house
side
speaking
at
97
congressional
record
2674
and
this
does
not
appear
in
any
of
the
briefs,
said
that
under
the
present
wording,
that
is
the
wording
of
this
qualifying
amendment
--
under
the
present
wording
of
the
bill,
active
and
voluntary
members
of
all
proscribed
parties
and
organizations
will
be
barred."
they're
putting
emphasis
on
the
word,
“active
members
would
be
barred."
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct.
mr.
david
rein
that's
--
well,
it
was
accepted
by
senator
--
mr.
david
rein
it
was
accepted
by
senator
mccarran.
it
did
not
come
to
a
separate
clause.
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct.
mr.
david
rein
that
is
correct.
in
other
words,
the
deletion
--
the
clarifying
amendment
had
in
parenthesis
except
with
regard
to
communist
organizations,
and
the
proposed
amendment
which
was
accepted
by
senator
mccarran
was
to
delete
that.
so
his
comments
go
to
the
original
meaning
of
the
act.
according
to
the
debate
also,
and
i
think
as
the
government
contends
and
we
agree,
the
purpose
that
congress
had
in
mind
in
indicating
this
was
to
say
that
they
wished
the
term
member
to
have
the
same
meaning
in
this
statute,
in
the
1950
statute
that
the
term
member
had
had
a
deportation
statutes
as
a
result
of
judicial
decision
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
1950
act.
and
that
what
they
were
doing
for
the
1951
qualification
was
to
restore
that
meaning
to
the
act.
this
leaves
us
with
the
consideration
as
what
guides
did
we
have
in
previous
judicial
decisions
defining
the
term
member.
there
were
no
decisions
in
this
court
that
are
all
relevant.
the
only
decision
that
was
cited
by
the
committee
which
brought
up
the
1951
amendment,
and
the
only
decision
that
i
am
familiar
with
to
discuss
this
term
in
any
detail
whatsoever
is
the
case
of
colyer
v.
skeffington
which
was
cited
in
--
by
congress
at
the
time
and
also
relied
upon
by
this
court
in
the
galvan
case.
now,
the
government
attempts
to
confine
the
colyer
case
to
a
very
narrow
situation.
it
quotes
from
one
excerpt
of
the
colyer
case
which
was
one
of
the
situations
before.
i
should
briefly
say
that
that
case,
before
i
go
into
it,
involved
the
deportation
of
a
whole
mass
group
of
aliens,
i
think
something
like
40
or
50
under
a
statute
of
1918
which
made
one
deportable
for
being
a
member
of
an
organization
that
advocated
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
the
issue
came
up
in
that
case
with
regard
to
all
40
of
these
whether
on
the
evidence
they
were
members
of
that
organization
as
well
as
many
other
issues.
and
the
court
discussed
that
question
and
found
that
a
number
of
them
were
not
members
of
that
organization
for
different
reasons.
the
government
in
its
brief
sets
out
only
one
rule,
one
quotation.
that
is
the
group
and
the
court
said,
we're
not
members
of
the
communist
party
because
they
had
originally
belonged
to
the
socialist
party.
the
socialist
party
had
changed
its
name
and
they
had
just
become
members
of
the
communist
party
by
virtue
of
the
change
of
name
of
the
socialist
party.
but
the
court
discussed
other
groups
as
well
and
its
broad
principle
was
not
limited
to
that
situation.
its
broad
principle
as
set
out
by
the
court
at
page
72
of
its
opinion,
it
said
that
the
membership
must
be
--
and
the
term
it
used
was
a
real
membership.
we
think
that
would
mean
a
membership
with
some
significance.
it
refer
to
one
other
case
which
it
reversed
where
the
alien
had
joined
the
communist
party,
solely
because
of
his
interest
in
the
social
activities
of
the
organization
because
he
found
it
a
good
place
to
--
people
who
spoke
his
language,
he
can
learn
to
read
and
write,
and
he
learned
arithmetic
there.
he
had
no
interest
in
politics
whatsoever
but
he
had
joined
the
communist
party,
had
joined
it
not
--
he
had
joined
it
consciously
and
notably.
the
government
would
seem
to
say
that
nominal
means
no
more
than
it
would
be
unconscious
or
unknowing.
but
there
was
a
case
in
colyer
where
he
joined
it,
but
joined
it
with
no
notion
of
what
the
nature
of
the
organization
was
at
all.
thinking
of
it
being
an
organization
without
regard
to
its
political
aspects,
or
the
court
there
found
that
that
was
a
nominal
member,
judge
anderson
in
that
case.
there
was
one
other
case
where
the
evidence
against
the
alien
showed
only
a
communist
party
membership
part
with
notation
of
dues
but
no
other
evidence
further
connecting
this
alien
with
the
communist
party.
now,
the
court
felt
that
that
was
not
--
that
that
did
not
make
him
a
member
within
the
terms
of
the
act.
i
say
to
the
court
that
on
the
basis
of
the
representations
made
by
the
government
here
that
what
was
meaningful
was
the
prior
interpretation
of
the
term
member
by
the
courts
before.
the
colyer
case
is
really
the
only
case
which
would
serve
as
a
guide
first
post.
and
under
the
doctrine
of
the
colyer
case,
the
--
the
alien
here
certainly
was
no
more
than
a
nominal
member.
i
turn
now
on
the
basis
of
--
consider
the
basis
of
these
principles
to
the
particular
facts
in
this
case,
i
think
at
the
very
least,
the
concept
of
nominal
membership
must
be
taken
to
establish
that
once
the
government
proves
that
an
alien
has
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
it
has
not
proven
its
case.
it
must
prove
something
more.
now,
galvan
said
that
something
more
does
not
necessarily
have
to
show
knowledge
of
the
unlawful
advocacy
of
the
communist
party
but
it's
not
enough
either
merely
to
show
nominal
membership.
there
is
an
area
in
between
which
this
court
has
not
yet,
perhaps
sketched
out
sufficiently
where
nominal
membership
ends
and
where
actual
and
meaningful
membership
for
the
purposes
of
the
deportation
statute
begins.
mr.
david
rein
yes.
mr.
david
rein
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
rein
that
is
correct.
it
was
just
his
statement.
mr.
david
rein
just
his
statement.
there
was
not
as
in
galvan
a
witness
against
the
alien
whose
testimony
might
have
added
to
the
statement.
there
was
separately
his
statement
which
was
introduced
in
the
evidence.
there
was
no
other
evidence,
no
other
testimony
against
it.
mr.
david
rein
yes.
mr.
david
rein
i
make
a
point
on
that.
i
didn't
mean
to
say
to
justice
frankfurter
that
the
only
thing
in
the
record
was
the
excerpts
that
i
read.
mr.
david
rein
i
said
--
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct.
mr.
david
rein
now,
that
statement
includes
more
than
what
i
read,
your
honor.
now,
with
respect
to
that
--
mr.
david
rein
no,
that
is
all
there
is
about
this
subject.
mr.
david
rein
no,
your
honor.
that's
one
of
the
points
that
i
wish
to
address
myself
--
mr.
david
rein
well,
it's
rather
a
confusing
statement
--
mr.
david
rein
it's
rather
a
confusing
statement.
at
one
point
he
says
he
gets
nothing.
mr.
david
rein
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
rein
yes.
mr.
david
rein
yes.
mr.
david
rein
i
think
that's
to
be
what
he
was
looking
--
mr.
david
rein
--
on
a
private
relieve.
mr.
david
rein
i'm
sorry.
mr.
david
rein
it's
quite
ambiguous,
your
honor.
the
statement
is
quite
ambiguous.
he
says
--
mr.
david
rein
no,
there
in
nothing
more
in
the
record.
i
would
only
say,
your
honor,
that
that's
an
argument
i
wish
to
come
to
later
that
i
think
that
it
indicates
the
need
of
--
had
a
minimum
for
the
case
to
be
turned
back
to
the
immigration
service
to
consideration
of
the
proper
issues,
but
i
want
to
come
to
that
later.
addressing
myself
now
to
justice
harlan's
comment
about
his
discussion
about
the
nature
of
communism
or
the
russian
revolution.
as
i
read
that,
your
honor,
they
seem
to
carry
his
views,
i
don't
say
that
they're
necessarily
the
communist
party's
views.
also,
it
is
quite
ambiguous
from
this
statement
as
to
when
these
views
were
applied,
when
they
were
expressed.
this
statement
was
made
in
january
of
1947,
the
membership
as
found
by
the
immigration
service
was
back
for
a
six-month
period
in
1935.
the
government
makes
its
point
in
his
brief
in
dealing
with
this
rather
--
what
i
would
consider
a
discursive
discussion
of
his
views
of
communism,
they
say
apparently
acquired
at
the
term
of
his
membership.
now,
there
is
nothing
in
the
statement
here
that
makes
that
apparent
and
i
don't
know
whether
he
acquired
these
views,
whatever
they
may
be
in
1935
or
whether
he
applied
them
much
later.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
says
--
and
this
is
at
page
11,
he
was
asked
this
particular
--
of
my
brief
again.
he's
asked
this
question.
question,
“what
is
your
personal
belief
as
to
the
principles
of
communism?”
answer,
“what
is
communism?
that
is
a
good
question.
my
belief
is
a
different
thing
than
communism
is.
according
to
marxism-leninism
i
have
seen
the
communists
working.
since
i
knew
of
them,
they
are
aiming
more
or
less
with
forever
methods
to
set
up
an
economic
system
to
get
the
people
out
of
a
monopoly
control
on
to
their
own
economic
feet.
that
is
the
way
i
see
them
working
now,”
spoken
in
1947.
i
would
say
whatever
that
it,
it's
a
very
individual
statement
of
the
petitioner.
and
also,
the
phrase,
“since
i
have
--
since
i
knew
of
that.
“now,
whether
that
means,
when
i
knew
of
them
or
last
week,
or
later,
i
don't
know.
the
matter
was
not
fully
explored.
i
would
say
this.
there
is
no
basis
for
the
government's
statement
to
say
that
he
had
this
knowledge
of
the
communist
party
at
the
time
of
his
membership.
maybe
he
did
and
maybe
he
didn't.
these
points
served
me
when
i
brought
into
with
the
hearing.
in
galvan,
this
court
found
that
the
alien
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
came
within
the
meaning
of
the
deportation
statute
on
a
basis
of
the
following
facts.
one,
that
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
for
two
years,
that
he
had
been
an
active
member
of
the
spanish
speaking
club
of
the
communist
party
and
that
he
had
been
an
officer
of
that
club.
they
concluded
from
those
factors
that
the
alien
relationship
to
the
communist
party
was
not
so
nominal
as
to
keep
him
--
or
from
outside
the
orbit
of
the
statute.
petitioner
here
was
a
member
for
only
six
months.
there
is
no
--
he
is
not
active
at
all
and
indeed
--
mr.
david
rein
well
--
mr.
david
rein
your
honor,
i
rely
on
the
immigration
service
finding
which
is
set
out
at
page
9
of
the
transcript
and
that
finding
is
for
about
six
months
and
--
mr.
david
rein
he
said
--
mr.
david
rein
well,
he
was
asked
first
when
he
joined.
he
said
in
the
spring
or
summer
and
left
toward
the
winter,
and
then
in
response
to
a
leading
question,
“was
that
about
one
year?”
he
said,
“yes.”
so
i
think,
your
honor,
that
--
mr.
david
rein
--
a
fair
reading
of
his
testimony
would
be
about
six
months.
mr.
david
rein
well,
i
won't
argue
the
point
other
than
to
say
that
that's
the
finding
of
the
immigration
service.
mr.
david
rein
that's
right.
and
he
stated
the
reason
why
he
quit,
not
this
one,
a
much
older
deportation
case.
mr.
david
rein
he
quite
because
he
said
that
at
the
time
he
had
joined
the
communist
party,
he
had
joined
as
he
stated
solely
because
his
interested
in
unemployment
relief
and
he
had
no
knowledge
there
was
anything
unlawful
or
wrongful
about
his
joining
the
communist
party
until
some
member
of
the
immigration
service
came
and
tell
him
that
it
was.
and
at
that
point
he
quit,
yes.
mr.
david
rein
he
kept
up
his
membership
in
the
workers'
alliance
for
about
two
years
but
that
has
no
problem
in
this
case.
and
as
i
can
see
it,
the
government
does
not
rely
on
saying
that
any
activity
in
the
workers'
alliance
would
in
any
way
indicate
that
he
was
more
than
an
active
member
of
the
--
that
he
was
--
that
that
constituted
in
anyway,
activity
in
the
communist
party.
i
don't
think
that
issue
is
in
the
case.
it's
not
suggested
either
by
the
immigration
service.
it's
not
suggested
here
by
the
government.
we
say
therefore
that
if
nominal
membership
means
anything,
it
means
that
there
must
be
shown
some
minimal
activity
and
that
the
sole
activity
shown
here
of
having
been
a
clerk
in
the
bookstore
for
a
brief
period
is
not
enough
to
take
the
alien
out
of
the
concept
of
nominal
membership.
we
argue
also
that
he
comes
within
two
explicit
exceptions
set
out
in
galvan
which
would
take
him
out
of
the
clause
of
nominal
membership.
one,
according
to
his
testimony
--
to
put
him
the
class
of
nominal
membership.
according
to
his
testimony
again
which
is
on
--
which
is
the
sole
evidence
on
which
the
deportation
ought
to
rest
here.
he
joined
to
obtain
the
necessities
of
life
because
of
the
fact
that
he
felt
it
was
necessary,
at
least
in
his
view,
that
he
joined
in
order
to
get
something
to
eat,
and
clothes
and
shelter.
that
was
his
reason
for
joining
and
that
comes
within
one
--
one
of
the
express
exceptions
as
set
forth
in
the
clarification
of
the
amendment.
secondly,
he
comes
within
the
provision
as
set
fort
in
the
quotation
from
colyer
against
skeffington
and
the
galvan
case
that
he
had
no
real
knowledge
of
the
platform
and
purposes
of
the
party.
and
this
is
significant
as
to
what
he
said
about
that.
he
said,
"even
if
the
few
communist
meetings
i
attended,
nothing
was
ever
said
about
overthrowing
anything.
all
they
talked
about
was
fighting
for
the
daily
needs.
that
is
why
we
never
thought
much
of
joining
those
parties
in
those
days."
i
submit
that
it
is
clear
he
never
really
gave
any
consideration
to
the
question
of
the
nature
of
the
communist
party
as
a
political
organization.
he
viewed
it
only
as
a
mechanism
through
which
he
could
--
he
and
others
could
get
unemployment
relief.
he
never
inquired
at
least
as
it
appears
here
from
his
testimony,
his
statement
which
is
all
that
is
in
the
record.
he
never
inquired
further
as
to
the
character
of
the
organization,
what
his
political
position
was
in
on
any
matters.
and
i
say
that
under
the
language
in
colyer
which
was
approved
by
this
court
in
galvan,
he
falls
within
the
category
of
one
who
had
no
real
knowledge
of
the
platform
and
purposes.
mr.
david
rein
sure.
mr.
david
rein
on
--
mr.
david
rein
in
this
particular
--
he
was
--
for
this
particular
deportation
proceeding?
in
about
1948,
originally.
mr.
david
rein
yes.
mr.
david
rein
well,
he
applied
all
that
i
could
see
that
happened.
this
statement
which
was
made
in
january
of
1947
was
made
in
connection
with
his
application
for
citizenship,
your
honor.
and
it
was
at
the
basis,
nothing
really
happened.
mr.
david
rein
of
1947.
mr.
david
rein
yes.
nothing
really
happened
in
between
1935
until
he
came
and
applied
for
citizenship.
mr.
david
rein
that
--
that
deportation
of
--
there
was
an
order
of
deportation
when
it
was
set
aside
according
to
the
government
on
the
basis
of
this
court's
decision
in
(inaudible)
saying
that
it
did
not
apply
to
past
membership
in
organizations.
mr.
david
rein
i
don't
believe
he
was
next
arrested
until
after
he
made
an
application
for
citizenship.
in
the
course
of
that
application
for
citizenship,
he
made
this
statement
--
this
was
an
interview
with
an
immigration
inspector
in
connection
with
an
application
for
citizenship.
and
after
he
made
this,
this
revived
the
matter
again
and
he
was
then
arrested,
i
believe,
in
1948
or
1949.
mr.
david
rein
yes.
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct.
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
rein
that
arrest
was
--
mr.
david
rein
no.
that
deportation
proceeding
in
1935
was
completely
wiped
out
and
there
was
nothing
paying
it.
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct.
there
was
no
evidence
to
the
contrary
and
no
contention
to
the
contrary.
mr.
david
rein
that
he
had
been
a
member
of
an
organization
was
different
in
the
present
statute
because
that
statute
did
not
provide
for
deportation
solely
on
being
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
one
had
to
be
a
member
of
an
organization
that
advocated
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
mr.
david
rein
and
that
was
the
claim
under
1935.
but
as
i
said,
the
matter
was
never
pressed
to
a
conclusion
by
the
government.
it
was
dropped.
and
the
proceeding
which
we
are
now
reviewing
here
is
a
completely
new
proceeding
and
is
not
a
continuation
about
all
the
problems.
mr.
david
rein
what?
mr.
david
rein
well,
he
was
arrested
originally
under
the
1940
act
but
by
the
time
it
came
up
for
hearings,
the
1950
act
had
been
passed,
the
charges
were
amended
to
include
the
charge
under
the
1950
act
and
the
deportation
here
is
under
the
1950
act,
not
under
the
1940
act.
mr.
david
rein
i'm
not
entirely
sure
about
that.
mr.
david
rein
yes.
mr.
david
rein
i
think
it
came
in
1938,
your
honor.
mr.
david
rein
well,
then
perhaps
your
[laughs]
recollection
is
much
better
than
mine.
the
government
somewhat
logically
acknowledges
the
concept
of
nominal
membership
but
it
tries
to
argue
--
deprive
that
concept
of
any
meaning.
it
also
tries
to
say
in
its
brief
that
the
petitioner
in
any
event
was
more
than
a
nominal
member,
but
it
does
this
by
--
what
i
would
say
as
an
argumentative
assertions
from
the
petitioner's
statement
in
the
record.
in
other
words,
it
wishes
to
draw
conclusions
which
not
apparent
from
the
face
of
the
statement,
that
which
they
think
can
be
argued.
now,
i
just
wish
to
give
one
example.
we
discussed
it
and
analyzed
it
more
fully
in
our
brief,
our
reply
brief
at
pages
2
to
3.
but
to
give
simply
one
example
of
the
kind
of
reasoning
that
the
government
engages
in,
we
say
the
petitioner's
assertion
that
he
joined
the
communist
party
because
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
came
hand-in-hand,
the
communist
party
and
the
fight
for
bread
is
translated
by
the
government
to
mean
that
he
joined
not
out
of
his
own
economic
necessity
but
to
participate
in
its
activities.
and
then
they
also
say
--
they
read
into
that
one
phrase
of
the
petitioner
that
that
also
means
that
the
petitioner
believed
that
the
party
was
the
appropriate
channel
through
which
to
seek
social
reforms
and
through
which
to
secure
ultimate
economic
benefits
to
society
generally.
well,
i
suggest
that's
reading
a
good
deal
into
that
single
statement
that
he
joined
because
the
communist
party,
in
the
fight
for
bread,
seemed
to
him
to
be
the
same
thing.
but
more
than
that,
your
honor,
and
i
think
it
raises
--
comes
to
another
issue
in
this
case,
these
are
inferences
which
are
being
made
by
the
government
in
its
brief
here
on
the
supreme
court
for
the
first
time.
they
are
not
inferences
that
we
made
by
the
immigration
service
--
mr.
david
rein
what?
mr.
david
rein
the
immigration
service
simply
said
he
was
a
member.
we
find
no
such
argumentation
--
mr.
david
rein
what
was
in
their
mind?
mr.
david
rein
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
a
fair
reading
of
those
decisions
would
indicate
--
mr.
david
rein
no.
a
fair
reading
of
the
--
their
decision
in
this
case
would
indicate
that
they
felt
no
responsibility
upon
them
to
find
anything
more
than
that
he
was
a
member.
that
the
entire
concept
of
nominal
membership
was
foreign
to
them,
but
they
paid
it
no
attention
and
that
it
never
was
in
their
mind.
and
i
think
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
we
have
here
a
case
where
in
any
event,
there's
a
minimum.
the
case
was
decided
by
the
administrative
agency
upon
an
improper
legal
theory
and
upon
an
improper
basis
and
that
even
if
--
even
if
the
statement
alone
would
seem
to
be
support
to
justify
a
finding
of
more
than
nominal
membership,
there
is
no
such
finding
in
the
record
here.
mr.
david
rein
well,
i
think
i've
done
the
best
i
could
in
what
i
have
said
up
until
now,
justice
harlan,
decided
that
--
mr.
david
rein
he
would
have
to
go
--
mr.
david
rein
i
think
--
no,
he
would
have
to
do
some
to
further
the
activities
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
david
rein
well
--
mr.
david
rein
i
think
it's
a
little
vague.
mr.
david
rein
i
think
it's
a
little
vague.
i
think
it
serves
as
a
guide
--
guide
post
but
as
to
(inaudible)
i
think
he
would
have
to
show
that
he
did
something
to
carry
out
--
mr.
david
rein
well,
i
think
that.
mr.
david
rein
well,
i
think
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
your
honor,
in
which
it
appears
from
this
testimony
that
all
he
said
was
that
he
was
in
there
for
--
well
alive,
merely
as
a
clerk,
selling
books.
i
don't
think
it's
enough.
i
think
he
would
have
to
be
carrying
--
and
it's
also
ambiguous,
i
would
say
as
whether
he
was
there
and
his
character
as
a
communist
party
member
or
what
it
was.
one
of
the
difficulties
with
this
record
in
determining
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
question
of
whether
he
was
a
nominal
member
or
argument,
because
of
the
fact
that
this
concept
was
not
something
that
occurred
to
the
immigration
service.
there's
really
no
exploring
of
the
subject.
all
they
have
is
this
interview
which
was
taken
in
january
of
1947.
that
interview
was
simply
put
into
the
record
and
that's
all
there
is.
mr.
david
rein
well,
it's
in
that
real
consideration.
mr.
david
rein
i
hope
--
mr.
david
rein
i
do.
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
i'm
about
--
mr.
david
rein
well,
there
it
is.
that's
what
--
mr.
david
rein
--
he
said
in
one
place
and
at
the
very
next
question
he
said,
“i
was
kind
of
a
salesman
and
i
didn't
run
it,
the
communist
party
run
it.”
mr.
david
rein
well,
it's
one
of
the
things
that
i
would
indicate
that
--
one
of
the
reasons
why
at
a
minimum,
i
would
the
case
should
go
back
to
the
immigration
service
because
i
think
it's
their
job
to
draw
our
inferences
from
this
statement
and
not
this
court's
job
to
do
it
as
a
matter
of
first
impression.
mr.
david
rein
certainly
--
mr.
david
rein
except
this
--
except
this
later
qualified
in
the
very
next
few
questions
and
answers.
he
says,
“i
didn't.
the
communist
party
ran
it.
i
was
just
kind
of
a
salesman.”
mr.
david
rein
well,
i
--
mr.
david
rein
no.
the
--
galvan
does
not
use
that
language.
galvan
uses
the
term
“nominal
member.”
it
does
not
refer
to
innocent
views.
and
i
think
the
question
is
as
it
appears
here
on
the
statement
and
i
think
we
have
to
take
it
that
a
sole
connection
with
the
communist
party
other
than
as
having
been
in
this
bookstore
was
that
he
joined
it
because
he
felt
that
this
was
a
way
to
get
unemployment
relief.
that's
his
statement
and
i
don't
see
how
we
can
go
beyond
it.
mr.
david
rein
no.
nor
even
if
how
long
the
period.
mr.
david
rein
it's
just
for
a
while.
no,
i
don't
know
how
long
for
a
while
it
is,
whether
that
--
that's
a
week
or
--
there's
just
no
further
exploration
of
the
subject
so
far
as
it
appears
in
this
record.
mr.
david
rein
well,
i
think
it's
an
indication
if
his
type
of
character,
but
certainly,
he
fits
in
his
own
individual
mold
and
nobody
else's
mold.
i
do
want
to
say
one
point,
one
further
remark
before
i
leave
this,
before
i
go
to
the
question
of
constitutionality,
and
that
is
that
we
have
in
our
reply
brief
cases
in
this
court
and
we
quote
from
them
indicating
that
where
there
is
any
ambiguity
upon
the
findings
of
the
immigration
service,
the
responsibility
of
this
court
is
not
to
resolve
or
clarify
that
but
to
send
it
back
to
the
administrative
agency
to
go
and
do
the
job.
and
i
think
that
as
a
minimum,
that
is
the
relief
we'll
be
entitled
to.
on
the
question
now
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
a
lot
of
--
i'll
address
myself
first
to
the
question
of
what
we
think
adopt
into
the
galvan
is,
as
we
read
the
decision
in
that
case.
and
we
read
it
as
holding
that
the
deportation
power
of
congress
is
to
all
practical
effect
without
any
constitutional
limitations
except
for
the
one
single
limitation
of
the
requirement
of
procedural
due
process.
that
is
certainly
not
limited
by
substantive
due
process.
it
is
not
limited
by
the
provisions
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause,
by
the
bill
of
attainder
clause
or
by
the
first
amendment.
we
argue
in
our
brief
that
such
a
view
is
not
supported
either
by
a
precedent
or
by
logic
and
hence,
should
be
overruled.
now,
the
government,
quite
interestingly
enough
in
its
brief,
thinks
that
galvan
says
too
much
in
that
respect
also.
and
right
off,
it
disagrees
with
us
as
to
what
we
think
that
galvan
falls
because
it
says
that
it
would
be
wrong
for
this
court
to
hold
that
there
are
no
constitutional
limitations
on
the
deportation
statute.
it
argues
that
substantive
due
process
is
a
limitation
on
the
exercise
of
congress'
power
to
deploy
and
that
a
deportation
statute
can
be
upheld
only
where
it
constitutes
a
reasonable
classification
of
currently
undesirable
aliens.
and
it
then
asserts,
and
i
say
it's
not
in
the
galvan
opinion,
that
that
is
what
galvan
did.
that
galvan
upheld
the
statute
on
the
ground
that
it
was
a
reasonable
classification
of
deportable
aliens.
but
we
think
the
government's
concession
in
this
case
requires
this
court
to
reexamine
galvan
because
certainly,
galvan
did
not
look
at
the
constitutional
issues
that
way.
mr.
david
rein
i
said
galvan
did
not
look
at
the
constitutional
issues
the
way
the
government
and
we
both
now
say
as
the
proper
way
to
look
at
it.
that
this
court
has
a
responsibility
to
test
deportation
statutes
under
orthodox
constitutional
standards
the
way
it
would
test
other
statutes.
and
that
--
mr.
david
rein
well,
no
because
if
congresscan
pass
any
statute
it
wishes
without
regard
to
the
limitations
of
(a)
the
due
process,
substantive
due
process
clause
without
regard
to
the
limitations
of
the
first
one
--
mr.
david
rein
yes.
i
cannot
read
in
any
other
way,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
to
indicate
it,
the
court
--
mr.
david
rein
well,
i
would
read
the
case
that
way
and
it
seems
to
me
when
the
case
says,
and
i
think
that
the
point
to
the
opinion
itself.
it
says
that
looking
at
this
statute
--
mr.
david
rein
it
said
if
due
process
follows
congress
from
enactments
that
shock
the
sense
of
fair
play,
which
is
the
essence
of
due
process,
one
is
entitled
to
ask
whether
it
is
not
beyond
the
power
of
congress
to
deport
an
alien
who
is
duped
into
joining
the
communist
party
particularly
when
his
conduct
antedated
the
enactment
of
the
legislation
under
which
his
deportation
is
sought.
and
then
the
court
went
on
to
say
that,
although
it
was
entitled
to
ask
that
but
the
court
was
not
going
to
ask
that
question
or
answer
it
either
because
they
said
policies
retaining
to
the
entry
of
aliens
and
there
right
to
remain
here
are
peculiarly
concerned
with
the
political
conduct
of
government.
a
formulation
of
these
policies
is
entrusted
exclusively
to
congress,
and
therefore,
the
court
never
considered
or
never
posed
that
question.
now,
i
can
only
read
that
as
meaning
that
if
this
court
felt
at
the
time
the
opinion
in
galvan
was
written,
that
substantive
due
process
applied,
that
it
would
have
considered
it
certainly
much
more
fully
than
it
did.
and
that
simply
say
that
our
hands
are
tied
by
a
previous
line
of
decisions
which
say
that
we
cannot
inquire
into
the
matter
and
therefore,
we
will
just
shut
the
door
on
it.
mr.
david
rein
no,
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
to
--
mr.
david
rein
well,
that's
what
galvan
said.
mr.
david
rein
oh,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
david
rein
oh,
i
don't
--
i
don't
draw
the
inference
from
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct.
mr.
david
rein
and
in
galvan,
your
honor,
the
court
said
that
even
though
the
due
process
clause
applies
to
the
war
power.
however,
it
doesn't
apply
to
deportation
statutes.
mr.
david
rein
no.
it
says
in
line
of
the
expansion
of
the
concept
of
substantive
due
process
--
mr.
david
rein
i'm
reading
from
my
brief
at
26
but
it's
from
page
530
to
31
of
galvan.
mr.
david
rein
yes.
in
line
of
the
expansion
of
the
concept
of
substantive
due
process
as
a
limitation
upon
all
powers
of
congress,
even
the
war
power,
much
could
be
said
for
the
view
and
this
is
in
commerce.
while
we're
writing
on
a
clean
slate
that
the
due
process
clause
qualifies
the
scope
of
political
discretion
heretofore
recognized
as
belonging
to
congress
in
regulating
the
entry
in
deportation
of
aliens.
now
--
mr.
david
rein
well
--
mr.
david
rein
well,
your
honor,
i
can
only
read
--
mr.
david
rein
well,
but
i
don't
think
that
what
else
galvan
would
be
saying
if
it
isn't
saying
--
it
isn't
saying
here.
mr.
david
rein
and
if
the
whole
case
--
mr.
david
rein
no,
no,
but
the
whole
case
said
when
it
comes
to
examine
the
deportation
statute,
this
court
will
not
apply
to
it
the
same
constitutional
standards
that
it
will
apply
to
other
congressional
statutes.
now,
unless
it
is
saying
that,
i
submit
that
it's
really
not
saying
anything.
and
significantly,
it
did
not
apply
the
same
standards
because
it
acknowledged
that
if
it
applied
the
same
standards,
for
example,
this
court
found
unconstitutional
the
depravation
of
a
university
teacher's
job
and
wieman
against
updegraff
on
the
ground
of
membership
of
an
organization
because
there
was
no
showing
of
knowledge
of
the
character
of
that
organization.
now
--
mr.
david
rein
i'm
sorry?
mr.
david
rein
that's
exactly
my
point.
galvan
says
that
that
ordinary
rule
that
applies
in
all
other
fields
and
all
other
statutes
don't
apply
to
deportation.
mr.
david
rein
well
--
mr.
david
rein
there
is
that
exerpt
in
it,
but
that
was
not
the
full
discussion
which
we
quoted,
indicates
the
deportation
statutes.
and
the
reason
why
they
would
come
to
that
conclusion
is
that
deportation
statutes
are
not
tested
by
the
same
standards
as
other
statutes
would
be
testified.
mr.
david
rein
well,
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
mean
that,
your
honor.[laughs]
but
to
leave
that
aside,
i
think,
your
honor,
and
my
time
is
running
out.
i
wish
to
refer
to
the
fact
that
to
leave
galvan
as
it
is
that
we
do
discuss
in
our
brief
the
fact
that
the
cases
which
were
decided
by
this
court
at
least
prior
to
the
risk
he
honors,
do
not
support
the
proposition
stated
in
galvan
about
deportation
statutes
being
of
a
separate
character
than
other
statutes,
and
therefore,
being
given
a
separate
kind
of
approach
with
regard
to
the
due
process
clause
or
other
provisions
of
the
constitution.
as
a
matter
a
fact
and
i
don't
have
time
to
review
those
cases
fully.
well,
i
think
an
examination
of
those
cases
in
terms
of
their
decisions
about
the
generalities
established
only
these
propositions
that
congress
has
an
unlimited
power
to
exclude
aliens
and
including
the
power
to
deport
for
illegal
entry,
that
it
may
employ
the
expulsion
power
to
implement
the
exclusion
policy
or
to
remove
resident
aliens
who
have
demonstrated
by
their
conduct
that
their
continued
presence
in
the
country
would
be
harmful,
and
that
legislation
so
limited
is
not
punishment.
generalizations
to
the
effect
that
the
expulsion
power
is
unlimited
and
that
deportation
power
is
not
a
punishment,
are
not
supported
by
the
decisions
and
a
contradicted
by
contrary
generalizations
in
this
court.
the
most
recent
contrary
generalization
was
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
jordan
against
de
george.
certainly,
prior
to
hierarchy
orders,
there
have
been
no
decision
which
upheld
any
controllable
statute
or
involved
any
of
the
features,
the
objectionable
features
of
the
1950
act.
there
was
accordingly
no
warrant
and
i'm
sorry
to
say
that
these
issues
were
foreclosed
by
prior
decisions.
i
think
that
if
we
consider
that
the
issue
was
a
fresh
one
and
that
the
slate
was
clean
at
least
so
far
as
the
1950
statute
was
concerned
and
if
we
test
the
statute
on
orthodox
constitutional
principles,
i
think
the
statute
must
fall.
it
must
fall
first
because
of
its
conflict
with
the
substantive
due
process
clause.
the
present
statute
is
invalid
because
it
is
special
legislation.
it
provides
for
the
expulsion
of
a
group
of
people
not
in
terms
of
culpable
characteristics
or
general
descriptions
but
by
name.
significantly,
the
only
time
that
congress
had
been
for
more
in
a
statute
of
a
similar
nature
and
that
was
fact
about
1940,
a
statute
calling
for
the
deportation
of
harry
bridges
by
name.
that
statute
was
rejected
by
the
congress
specifically
by
the
senate,
specifically
on
constitutional
grounds
that
congress
did
not
have
the
power
to
pass
a
deportation
statute
which
can
deport
one
by
name.
this
statute
is
no
different
in
principle.
it
just
has
a
larger
group.
in
addition,
it
is
no
answer
to
suggest
that
the
government
does,
that
the
statute
was
based
upon
evidence
considered
by
congress
as
to
the
character
of
the
communist
party,
that
the
communist
party
was
a
tenacious
organization.
the
due
process
means
anything,
and
if
it
prohibits
special
legislation,
it
prohibits
condemnation
by
legislative
fiat
without
regard
to
whether
that
is
reasonable
or
not.
because
if
the
legislature
cannot
pass
such
a
statute,
it
is
not
give
--
if
the
legislature
passed
such
a
statute,
it
is
not
giving
due
process.
and
to
consider
the
question
of
whether
they
had
evidence
before
them
does
not
meet
the
question.
because
you
could
have
evidence
to
justify
any
special
legislation,
deportation
against
harry
bridges
or
under
the
same
logic,
deportation
or
statutes
could
be
enacted
exclusively
against
other
groups
in
the
community
such
as
catholics
or
negroes
on
the
ground
that
there
is
evidence.
the
statute
is
irrational
moreover
and
therefore
in
conflict
with
the
substantive
due
process
clause
for
other
reasons.
the
general
justification
given
for
the
power
of
congress
to
expel
aliens
is
that
it
enables
the
state
to
rid
itself
of
undesirable
alien
residents.
that
is
the
general
theory
given
for
it.
but
the
present
statute
--
mr.
david
rein
i'm
sorry,
under
what
argument?
mr.
david
rein
no,
your
honor,
because
anarchist
is
not
a
name,
anarchist
is
a
description
of
a
category
of
people.
this
is
not
--
it
maybe
unreasonable
but
my
argument
addresses
only
to
the
fact
that
this
three-fourths
people
who
are
members
of
the
communist
party
by
name
without
regard
to
what
the
communist
party
does
or
doesn't
do.
this
statute
makes
it
a
matter
of
indifference
as
to
what
the
nature
of
the
communist
party
is.
it
fixed
them
out
by
name,
and
that's
the
point
so
the
--
the
provision
about
anarchists
would
have
no
--
no
reference
to
it.
this
doesn't
explore
--
this
doesn't
expel
people
who
believe
in
anarchism
or
who
believe
in
communism.
this
only
expels
people
who
are
members
of
the
communist
party,
making
all
other
things
irrelevant.
the
present
statute
is
even
more
irrational
because
it
disregards
all
the
considerations
that
would
be
relevant
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
particular
alien
is
undesirable.
it
ignores
for
example
the
alien's
lack
of
knowledge
of
the
evil
nature
of
the
organization.
it
ignores
the
nature
of
his
activities
in
the
organization,
whether
these
activities
were
innocuous,
commendable,
or
even
when
they
were
non-existent.
it
ignores
the
length
of
his
membership
or
it
ignores
how
long
ago
it
was.
in
addition
to
that,
it
exhibits
no
interest
whatsoever
in
what
manner
of
a
man
the
alien
was
at
that
time
of
the
action
of
deportation.
but
this
--
if
this
was
a
rational
statute
based
upon
expelling
undesirable
aliens,
currently
undesirable
aliens
which
apparently
is
a
theory
of
it,
this
would
be
the
relevant
factors
which
it
would
discuss.
but
the
statute
ignores
all
of
these
relevant
factors
which
would
be
reasonable
in
its
application
and
it
applies
its
policy
instead
on
a
basically
irrational
factor.
certainly,
as
applied
to
the
particular
petitioner
here,
the
statute
is
clearly
irrational.
because
on
this
record
the
petitioner
is
being
deported
solely
because
20
years
ago
in
a
different
political
climate
he
was
an
active
in
a
movement
for
relief
of
the
unemployed.
mr.
david
rein
at
the
time,
by
name?
mr.
david
rein
i
would
think
that
that
would
have
possibly
some
of
the
objectionable
features
of
this
statute
if
not
all
because
--
but
not
--
but
not
others.
it
would
still
have
the
objectionable
feature
that
it's
a
special
legislation
because
it
applies
to
a
group
without
regard
to
its
culpable
characteristics.
because
if
one
says
the
communist
party
then
it
wouldn't
matter
whether
the
communist
party
did
or
did
not
advocate
the
overthrow,
it
wouldn't
matter
what
the
character
of
the
communist
party
was.
it
would
also
have
the
objectionable
feature
of
ignoring
the
element,
the
important
element
which
this
court
set
out
in
wieman
against
updegraff
of
making
irrelevant
the
particular
individual's
knowledge
of
the
character
of
the
communist
party,
which
it
seems
to
me
would
also
be
an
important
element
in
considering
whether
or
not
he
was
an
undesirable
alien.
but
it
still
would
be
somewhat
more
rational
than
the
present
one
which
has
in
addition
to
that
all
of
these
other
irrational
elements
of
being
a
long
time
ago
and
it
could
have
been
of
a
brief
period.
well,
i
think
that
--
that
the
statute
is
to
be
measured
as
to
whether
it's
a
reasonable
statute
to
deport
currently
undesirable
aliens,
then
under
those
standards,
even
that
statute
i
think
would
have
to
fall
because
it
would
be
defining
it
not
in
terms
of
culpable
characteristics
but
it
self
is
solely
in
terms
of
membership
in
an
organization.
and
particularly,
one
of
the
defects
of
this
statute
--
and
of
that
statute
too
would
be
the
assumption
that
the
communist
party
can
never
change
which
itself
i
believe
is
an
irrational
assumption.
i
don't
think
i
have
time
now
to
develop
the
remainder
of
my
argument
on
the
bill
of
attainder
and
ex
post
facto,
and
perhaps
i
can
save
a
few
minutes
that
might
be
remaining
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
david
rein
i
don't
think
that
i
could
(inaudible)
much
more
of
the
one
or
two
minutes.
mr.
david
rein
thank
you.
mr.
david
rein
thank
you
your
honor.
this
is
an
action
to
review
and
set
aside
a
deportation
order
entered
against
the
petitioner.
the
petitioner
here
is
an
alien,
a
native
of
germany.
he
is
73
years
of
age
and
he
has
resided
in
the
united
states
since
1940
at
which
time
he
entered
permanent
residence.
he
has
lived
here
in
other
words
for
a
period
of
about
43,
44
years.
he
applied
for
citizenship
in
1942,
but
citizenship
was
denied.
the
deportation
order
here
is
based
upon
the
statute
section
22
of
the
internal
security
act
which
was
enacted
in
1950.
this
section
provides
for
the
deportation
of
aliens
who
were
at
any
time
in
the
past
members
of
the
communist
party.
the
order
here
was
based
upon
a
finding
by
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
that
the
petitioner
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
for
about
six
months
in
the
year
1935,
that's
15
years
before
the
passage
of
the
act
which
authorized
his
deportation.
the
finding
of
the
immigration
service
in
this
case
rests
entirely
upon
a
statement
which
was
made
by
petitioner
under
oath
to
a
representative
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service.
that
statement
is
set
out
substantial
in
full
in
our
brief
appearing
at
pages
4
to
page
11.
i
wish
to
direct
the
court's
attention
at
this
time
to
certain
portions
of
that
statement
which
we
believe
are
the
more
significant
portions
bearing
upon
the
issues
in
this
case.
reading
from
page
5
of
our
brief
a
question
was
put
to
the
petitioner,
“what
was
purpose
of
your
joining
the
communist
party?”
answer,
“the
purpose
was
probably
this,
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
came
hand
in
hand,
the
communist
party
and
the
fight
for
bread.
it
seemed
to
me
like
this;
let's
put
it
this
way
that
the
communist
party
and
workers
alliance
had
one
aim
--
to
get
something
to
eat
for
the
people.”
on
the
same
theme
at
page
10
of
our
brief
toward
the
end
of
the
statement,
the
question
was
again
put
to
the
petitioner,
“again
referring
to
your
joining
the
communist
party
in
1935
was
this
motivated
by
the
satisfaction
and
living
under
a
democracy?”
answer,
“no,
not
by
that.”
“just
a
matter
of
having
no
jobs
at
that
time,
everybody
around
me
had
the
idea
that
we
had
to
fight
for
something
to
eat
and
cloths
and
shelter.
we
were
not
thinking
then
--
anyways
the
fellows
around
me
of
overthrowing
anything.
we
wanted
something
to
eat
and
something
to
crawl
into.”
question,
“you
say
fight
for
something
to
eat
and
crawl
into.
what
do
you
mean
by
that
term?”
answer.
“we
had
to
go
and
ask
those
who
had
it
--
that
was
the
courthouse
at
that
time.
we
petitioned
city,
state
and
national
government.
we
did
and
we
succeeded.
we
finally
got
unemployment
laws
and
a
certain
budget.
even
at
the
few
communist
meetings
i
attended,
nothing
was
ever
said
about
overthrowing
anything.
all
they
talked
about
was
fighting
for
the
daily
needs.
that
is
why
we
never
thought
much
of
joining
those
parties
in
those
days.”
the
statement
also
contains
statement
of
the
petitioner's
beliefs
in
which
he
stated
that
he
did
not,
never
had
believed
in
the
advocacy
or
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
also
a
statement
of
his
own
question
of
philosophy
which
i
think
that
without
going
into
any
further
detail,
can
certainly
be
characterized
as
an
individualistic
philosophy.
mr.
david
rein
surely.
mr.
david
rein
well
i
would
think
it
would
mean
the
communist
party
or
any
other
party
of
a
similar
radical
nature
is
--
unfortunately
your
honor
all
we
have
is
this
statement.
mr.
david
rein
i
think
he
would
be
meaning
communist
party
or
maybe
--
mr.
david
rein
i
think
he
would
mean
that
he
was
not
giving
any
real
significance
to
the
nature
of
the
organization.
mr.
david
rein
no
this
is
all
--
mr.
david
rein
we
have.
mr.
david
rein
yes.
mr.
david
rein
he
may
have
been,
that
was
a
part
of
it.
mr.
david
rein
what?
mr.
david
rein
sorry
he
talks
about,
when
he
was
asked
about
what
he
joined,
he
did
say
that
he
joined
the
workers
alliance
and
the
communist
party,
he
did
co-join
them
in
the
statement.
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct,
this
is
all
there
is
in
the
record.
there
is
no
more
than
his
voluntary
statement,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
distinguish
this
from
perhaps
the
galvan
case
in
the
sense
that
there
were
no
witnesses
who
testified
as
against
the
petitioner
who
gave
any
evidence
to
indicate
that
his
activities
or
the
nature
of
his
membership
was
any
different
than
appears
from
his
own
statement.
i
should
add
that
he
was
asked
what
the
nature
of
his
activity
was
in
the
communist
party
and
that
appears
also
in
the
record
at
our
brief
at
page
78
in
which
he
said,
his
only
activity
was
that
for
a
short
while,
he
acted
as
a
kind
of
a
salesman
in
a
bookstore
run
by
the
communist
party
at
the
time
and
he
said,
he
had
no
other
activity
other
than
that.
we
have
raised
two
questions
in
our
brief
here,
one
is
--
mr.
david
rein
there
is
no
evidence
substantial
--
mr.
david
rein
no
evidence
of
any
kind.
all
that
appears
is
his
own
statement.
there
is
no
evidence
at
all
except
from
that
statement,
so
i
can
certainly
there
is
no
substantial
evidence.
we
raise
two
questions
in
our
brief,
one
is
the
question
of
nominal
membership
in
which
we
argue
that
the
petitioner
was
merely
a
nominal
member
and
therefore
does
not
fall
within
the
confines
of
the
deportation
statute
here
involved
and
second
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
that
statute.
i
wish
to
address
myself
to
the
first
question,
his0
nominal
membership
first.
galvan
against
press
which
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
section
22
of
the
internal
security
act
of
1950,
the
statute
involved
here,
recognized
however
that
it
was
possible
to
be
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
still
be
only
a
nominal
member.
as
we
read
galvan,
this
was
not
equivalent
to
being
an
involuntary
or
unconscious
member
that
concededly
we
raise
no
point
about
it.
it
was
not
necessary
to
be
more
than
a
nominal
member
to
have
full
knowledge
of
the
unlawful
advocacy
of
the
communist
party
or
the
doctrines
of
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence
but
it
was
necessary
to
take
one
out
of
the
classification
of
nominal
member
to
show
something
more
than
mere
membership.
mr.
david
rein
what
we
claim
at
galvan,
appreciating
the
language
and
the
debates
and
the
clarifying
amendment
passed
in
1951
that
congress
itself
said
that
it
did
not
wish
any
kind
of
a
member
to
come
within
the
confines
of
the
statute.
now
to
go
back
of
that,
congress
itself
when
it
passed
this
1951
clarifying
amendment
said
it
was
doing
no
more
and
wanted
to
do
no
more
than
the
law
as
it
had
existed
prior
to
the
1950
statute.
i
should
clarify
that
when
i
say
the
laws
that
existed
with
regard
to
members
of
organizations.
in
other
words,
prior
to
1950
there
had
been
no
statute
providing
for
the
deportation
of
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
there
had
been
statutes
going
all
the
way
back
to
1918
and
1919
providing
for
the
deportation
of
members
of
organizations
that
advocated
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
and
i
wish
to
indicate
that
the
meaning
of
that
term
‘member'
was,
as
they
said,
to
be
construed
as
it
had
been
construed
in
cases
in
the
past,
and
then
they
gave
their
notion
of
how
that
had
been
construed.
in
other
words,
they
were
saying
they
were
just
clarifying
it.
we
just
set
out
in
our
--
mr.
david
rein
yes.
mr.
david
rein
yes,
galvan
says
that
expressly.
mr.
david
rein
those
three
--
mr.
david
rein
yes,
galvan
says
that
expressly.
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
says
that
in
examining
the
debates
of
1951
amendment,
particularly
the
reference
in
the
congressional
debates
for
the
opinion
of
colyer
against
skeffington,
galvan
expressly
says
that
congress
are
meant
to
exclude
other
categories
from
the
class
of
membership
or
to
include
them
with
a
nominal
membership
other
than
these
three
specific
categories.
that's
the
--
that's
an
express
statement
in
galvan.
if
i
may
say,
it's
on
page
20
of
my
brief
quoting
from
page
5
to
7
of
galvan,
“congress
did
not
provide
that
the
three
types
of
situations
that
enumerated
and
the
1951
corrective
statute
should
be
the
only
instances
where
membership
is
so
nominal
as
to
keep
an
alien
out
of
the
deportable
class.”
so
we
say
that
galvan
said
that
even
if
an
individual
did
not
fall
into
any
of
these
three
categories,
he
could
still
fall
outside
of
the
scope
of
the
statute
that
these
membership
was
of
a
nominal
character.
and
indeed
that
doctrine
of
galvan
finds
support
in
the
debates.
we
have
set
out
in
our
supplemental
reply
brief
of
a
language
used
by
senator
ferguson
in
the
course
of
the
debate
on
the
senate
floor.
now
senator
ferguson's
comments
are
particularly
appropriate
here
because
he
was
the
mover
of
the
amendment
in
the
form
in
which
it
was
finally
adopted.
i
should
say
that
the
time
in
1951
clarifying
amendment
was
first
brought
in
by
senator
mccarran
on
behalf
of
the
judiciary
committee,
it
provided
that
it
would
apply
only
to
members
of
so
called
fascist
organizations
and
do
not
provide
this
clarification
or
exception
for
members
of
allegedly
communist
organizations.
senator
ferguson
moved
to
amend
that
clarifying
provision
so
that
it
would
cover
members
of
communist
organizations
as
well
as
fascist
organizations.
that
amendment
was
adopted
and
it
was
passed
in
that
form.
so
senator
ferguson
is
really
the
author
of
the
amendment
in
the
form
in
which
it
passed.
we
have
set
out
two
quotes
from
him
in
the
debate
and
it
is
clear
he
says,
that
his
understanding
of
the
amendment
is
that
it
would
exclude
all
those
who
are
communists
by
conviction
what
we
call
mentally
communists,
but
it
would
not
exclude
those
who
really
in
effect
never
have
been
what
i
call
mentally
communists
and
he
goes
on
and
repeats
himself
at
a
later
portion
of
the
congressional
record.
also
is
significant,
and
i
think
this
is
of
great
significance
here,
is
that
congress
itself
said
that
the
meaning
to
be
used
in
members
here
is
to
be
found
in
the
way
it's
been
interpreted
in
the
courts
in
the
past.
and
they
refer
to
one
case
as
the
chief
source,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
the
only
case
i
know
of
which
really
discussed
this
problem,
when
one
could
be
a
member
of
a
the
communist
party
but
on
his
relationship
was
still
so
nominal
as
to
keep
him
without
the
scope
of
the
statute
and
that
is
the
district
court
case
of
colyer
against
skeffington.
the
congressional
memorandum
quoted
approvingly
from
that
case
and
so
did
galvan.
we
have
set
out
again
in
our
supplemental
reply
brief
other
quotations
from
that
case,
which
i
think
especially
are
in
force
with
this
particular
case.
at
page
3
for
example,
colyer
against
skeffington
indicated
and
in
fact
set
aside
deportation
orders
and
i
am
reading
from
page
3
of
my
supplemental
reply
brief,
when
i
say
the
‘reply
brief'
on
re-argument
in
which
the
court
said,
“social,
educational
purposes
and
race
sympathy
rather
than
political
agitation
constituted
the
controlling
motive
with
a
large
share
of
them,”
that
is
aliens
ordered
deported
on
grounds
of
membership.
“they
join
the
local
russian
and
polish
or
lithuanian
socialist
or
communist
club,
just
as
citizens
join
neighborhood
clubs,
social
or
religious
or
civic
or
fraternal.”
the
court
then
in
two
other
cases,
this
case
involved
a
member
of
separate
cases,
which
were
being
all
reviewed
in
one
decision
in
colyer
against
skeffington.
one
of
the
cases
significantly
show
that
the
sole
evidence
against
the
alien
there
was
that
he
had
paid
dues
to
the
communist
party
for
three
months.
the
court
held
that
that
was
insufficient
proof
to
show
that
character
of
membership
to
fall
within
the
statute
and
it
set
aside
the
deportation
order
in
that
case.
mr.
david
rein
rowoldt,
about
six
months.
mr.
david
rein
well
the
record
on
that
again
it's
his
statement.
he
was
asked,
he
was
asked
when
he
joined,
he
said
in
the
spring
or
early
summer
of
1935.
when
did
you
leave,
towards
the
end
of
1935.
later
the
question
was
put
to
him
by
a
representative
of
the
service,
he
said,
“then
you
were
a
member
for
about
a
year?”
and
he
said,
“yes.”
well
i
think
that
it's
fair
inference
it
was
probably
about
six
months.
significantly
the
immigration
service
which
made
the
finding
in
this
case
and
the
finding
before
you
its
finding
is
for
a
period
of
about
six
months.
so
they
gave
him
a
benefit
of
whatever
doubt
that
they
have
been
from
his
testimony
and
i
think
that
is
the
finding
before
your
honor
here.
mr.
david
rein
well
it
appears
here
i
would
say
from
this
record
that
he
probably
did
pay
dues
from
his
statement.
mr.
david
rein
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
judge
anderson's
opinion
there
did
go
ahead
and
(inaudible)
to
the
cases
that
i
have
indicated
which
were
reversed
but
not
appealed
from
the
government.
judge
anderson
went
a
little
further
as
a
matter
of
fact,
and
he
had
three
other
cases
where
he
found
that
these
people
were
really
members,
an
active
members
of
the
party
and
he
reversed
that
too
on
the
ground
that
there
had
not
been
any
showing
of
personal
advocacy
on
their
part.
the
government
appealed
only
those
cases
and
those
cases
were
reversed
in
the
case
of
skeffington
against
katzeff.
but
these
cases
the
government
conceded
were
the
law
and
were
the
proper
interpretation
of
member.
there
is
one
other
case
i
think
of
significance
that
he
reversed
which
we
recite
was
where
an
alien
joined
the
communist
party
because
to
him
the
organization
offered
an
opportunity
where
he
can
learn
to
read,
write
and
do
elementary
arithmetic
requisite.
judge
anderson
reversed
that
and
significantly
he
said
the
crucial
factor
of
reversing
in
that
case,
was
here
was
an
individual
who
showed
no
interest
in
politics
and
was
joining
the
communist
party
for
completely
different
reasons.
in
my
view
the
case
was
clear
that
he
knew
that
he
was
joining
the
communist
party
and
it
was
a
voluntary
act
on
his
part,
but
the
thing
that
took
him
out
of
the
class
of
membership
that
came
within
the
statute
was
because
of
the
purpose
of
his
joining,
that
he
no
interest
in
politics.
mr.
david
rein
surely.
mr.
david
rein
well
no
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
i
think
that
galvan
does
no
more
--
mr.
david
rein
no
i
would
say
that
galvan
does
no
more
than
recognize
what
the
congressional
intent
of
congress
was
as
indicated
in
the
1951
clarifying
amendment
and
as
indicated
in
the
case
of
colyer
against
skeffington,
i
think
that
if
we
didn't
have
galvan,
the
job
would
be
for
this
court
to
do
what
it
did
in
galvan.
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct.
mr.
david
rein
that
is
correct,
in
other
words
i
think
galvan
indicates
what
the
legislative
definition
was,
but
even
without
galvan
i
think
the
same
result
should
be
(inaudible).
i
think
that
the
material
which
we
have
set
out
establishes
and
the
debate
establishes
that
for
a
membership
to
be
more
that
nominal,
there
must
be
some
evidence
of
some
meaningful
activity.
in
other
words,
the
government
cannot
make
out
a
case
under
this
statute
by
merely
showing
membership,
it
must
show
something
more,
because
if
you
merely
show
membership,
then
literally
you
are
showing
only
membership
and
name
only
and
you
are
showing
only
nominal
membership,
nominal
membership
which
does
not
come
in
within
the
scope
of
the
statute.
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct
and
we
make
no
--
we
have
not
disputed
that
in
our
brief
--
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct.
mr.
david
rein
it
is
not
even
necessary
that
he
have
knowledge
as
a
matter
of
fact,
under
galvan
it's
not
even
–
that's
one
of
the
issues
we
raise
in
our
discussion
on
constitutionality.
i
would
say
under
galvan
it's
not
even
necessary
to
show
that
he
had
knowledge,
that
the
organization
had
such
practice.
mr.
david
rein
galvan
says
that
unequivocally.
mr.
david
rein
that
is
correct.
i
certainly
think
that
under
those
standards
the
facts
here,
put
the
petitioner
in
the
class
of
a
nominal
member,
because
of
the
fact
that
really
all
the
government
shows
when
you
come
right
down
it
is
that
he
was
a
member
communist
party,
no
more.
the
single
exception
they
have
to
that
--
mr.
david
rein
no
they
do
not
show
that.
mr.
david
rein
well
i
would
say
this,
they
do
show
he
worked
in
the
bookstore,
they
do
not
show
that
he
had
more
than
a
speaking
acquaintance
with
marxist
classics.
the
questions
addressed
to
him
and
which
he
answered
were
answered
in
1947
and
he
was
asked
about
what
he
might
have
known
about
marxist
classics
or
lenin,
and
i
might
say
that
whatever
he
did
know
about
them
showed
that
he
knew
the
names
of
these,
certainly
his
views
were
different,
but
there
is
no
evidence
that
his
knowledge
at
that
time,
his
knowledge
at
that
time
that
he
might
have
had
in
1947
was
knowledge
he
possessed
in
1935.
mr.
david
rein
that
is
correct,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
statement
of
the
petitioner
where
he
discusses
these
marxist
classics,
he
states
his
disagreement
with
it.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
one
question
he
was
asked
about
his
opinion
of
the
communist
party
to
which
he
is
answer
is
the
communist
party
since
i
have
known
of
them,
there
is
no
basis
to
assume
that
any
knowledge
he
has
of
--
was
current
to
1935.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
fair
inference
of
the
statement
is
that
it
was
since
1935,
remember
the
statement
was
made
in
1947.
also
i
think
and
one
factor
which
your
honor
has
left
out
in
considering
the
question
of
whether
he
was
a
nominal
member
or
not,
his
own
statement
as
to
why
he
joined
the
communist
party
and
what
his
interest
was.
he
stated
that
his
interest
was
not
a
political
interest,
but
that
he
had
a
very
limited
interest
in
joining
the
party
and
that
was
the
struggle
for
bread.
now
i
think
that
has
to
be
taken
into
account
similarly
as
judge
anderson
took
into
the
account
the
fact
that
the
alien
who
joined
the
communist
party
was
interested
in
a
place
where
he
could
learn
to
read
and
write.
so
i
think
gathering
all
those
factors
together,
the
membership
here
was
certainly
of
a
character
that
can
only
be
described
as
nominal.
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct.
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct
and
i
think
that
was
the
inquiry
adopted
in
carlo
against
anderson
and
that
seems
to
be
what's
in
the
back
of
--
clearly
if
anything
is
in
the
back
of
senator
ferguson's
mind
and
we
must
assume
there
was,
he
uses
the
phrase
that
this
amendment
will
not
exclude
those
who
were
mentally
communists
or
communists
by
conviction.
in
other
words,
senator
ferguson
would
assume
that
someone
who
joined
the
communist
party
for
reasons
completely
disassociated
with
politics,
but
for
other
very
immediate
reasons
as
in
this
case
because
of
the
fact
that
he
was
interested
in
an
opportunity
in
a
way
of
getting
unemployment
relief
and
his
interest
is
his
--
in
this
record
was
limited
to
that
and
never
went
any
further
that,
that
kind
of
membership
is
merely
nominal
membership.
we
argue
also
that
on
the
point
raised
earlier
by
justice
harlan
that
he
falls
because
of
the
reasons
why
he
joined
the
communist
party
in
his
own
statements,
he
falls
within
one
specific
exception
as
set
forth
in
the
1951
act,
and
that
is
that
he
joined
for
the
purposes
of
obtaining
the
necessities
of
life.
mr.
david
rein
yes.
mr.
david
rein
we
say
no.
we
say
in
addition
to
that,
however,
that
even
if
the
court
would
disagree
with
us
and
say
that
it
was,
it's
not
the
function
of
this
court
to
make
that
finding
in
the
first
place.
i
think
one
thing
that
is
perfectly
clear,
it's
perfectly
clear
from
the
record
here,
the
findings
made
by
the
immigration
service
and
indeed
even
by
the
argument
still
presented
by
the
government
here
that
the
concept
of
nominal
membership
is
really
never
permeated
the
immigration
service.
they
equated
with
voluntary
and
conscious
membership,
and
so
long
as
the
fact
that
remains
and
the
record
shows
that
the
individual
was
alive
and
awake
at
the
time
he
joined
that
is
enough
for
them
and
that
is
all
they
found
in
this
case.
but
if
that
therefore
at
a
minimum,
even
if
the
court
thinks
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
here
and
we
think
there
was
not
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
our
brief,
it
is
not
for
this
court
to
make
the
original
determination.
we
have
cited
authorities
to
that
effect,
i
think
the
securities
exchange
commission
against
chenery
and
two
labor
board
cases
indicating
that
where
a
finding
from
an
administrative
agency
comes
before
this
court
and
is
based
upon
insufficient
--
is
based
upon
inadequate
grounds,
illegal
grounds
this
court's
function
is
to
set
it
aside
and
set
it
back
and
not
to
make
an
original
determination
as
to
how
the
service
could
have
come
out
if
it
had
used
of
the
proper
standings.
it's
also
conceivable
that
if
the
case
went
back
to
the
service
it
might
have
a
better
record,
i
think
as
justice
frankfurter
has
said,
the
record
here
is
a
very
bare
one,
and
perhaps
it
might
have
better
act
in
which
the
issue
can
be
explored
on
both
sides
as
to
the
character
of
the
petitioner's
membership.
as
i
say
we
think
the
petitioner
here
also
belongs
within
specific
exception
because
of
the
fact
that
under
the
facts
here
it
is
clear
that
he
joined
to
obtain
the
necessities
of
life.
also
and
this
is
language
in
galvan,
but
which
comes
out
of
senator
mccarran's
quotation
from
colyer
against
skeffington
is
that
an
alien
who
joins
an
organization
but
who
has
no
real
knowledge
of
any
of
its
platforms
and
purposes
and
is
not
aware
that
it
has
a
distinct
and
active
political
organization,
falls
in
the
character
of
a
nominal
membership.
in
that
connection
we
like
to
indicate
what
seems
to
us
the
significant
language
in
this
record
in
which
the
petitioner
in
being
asked
why
he
joined
the
communist
party
said
all
they
talked
about
was
fighting
for
the
daily
needs,
that
is
why
we
never
thought
much
of
joining
those
parties
in
those
days.
now
whether
he
meant
to
include
the
communist
party
and
the
other
types
of
parties
or
the
communist
party
and
the
workers
alliance,
it's
perfectly
clear
from
the
meaning
of
that
statement
and
i
think
it
can
lead
only
one
inference
that
he
was
not
joining
this
organization
and
thereby
adhering
to
a
set
of
political
ideas.
what
he
was
doing
was
joining
an
organization
which
could
help
them
in
gaining
the
relief
at
that
present
moment
and
not
going
beyond
that,
(inaudible)
mr.
david
rein
i
believe
it
was
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
court
itself
has
set
out
statistics
in
that
in
its
own
case
in
(inaudible)
and
i
believe
they
said
it
was
on
the
ground
at
that
time,
i
do
not
know
exactly,
i
know
it
is
on
the
ballot
in
many
states.
mr.
david
rein
no,
significantly
and
interestingly
the
only
place
where
i
know
where
the
immigration
services
recognized
the
concept
and
that
was
--
arose
with
the
history
in
this
court,
after
this
court
decided
galvan,
about
a
month
later
or
maybe
the
following
week
this
court
granted
certiorari
in
the
case
of
garcia
against
langer,
which
seemingly
was
pretty
much
the
same
kind
of
facts
at
least
on
the
surface,
the
issue
where
the
petitioner
raised
only
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
the
case
was
not
heard
by
this
court
because
in
the
following
term
in
october
the
service
filed
a
memorandum
with
a
suggestion
of
mootness,
in
which
they
asked
that,
that
case
be
sent
back
to
them,
because
of
the
language
in
galvan,
they
could
consider
whether
or
not
that
alien
was
a
nominal
member.
now
i
don't
know
what
they
ever
did
with
that
case
at
all,
but
i
have
seen
no
decision
of
the
immigration
service
in
which
there
was
any
discussion
as
to
whether
or
not
a
person
is
or
is
not
a
nominal
member.
their
decision
since
and
before
galvan
still
say
he
was
a
member,
and
that's
all
they
say,
without
any
further
discussion
of
these
issues.
mr.
david
rein
i
would
like
to
turn
now
to
an
argument
on
the
subject
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
i
think
the
initial
problem
we
have
on
that
is
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
deportation
statutes
are
or
not
subject
to
constitutional
limitations
and
are
or
not
subject
to
judicial
review,
under
either
the
due
process
clause,
the
first
amendment
or
other
provisions
of
the
bill
of
rights.
the
last
time
that
this
case
was
argued
before
this
court,
our
chief
complaint
against
galvan,
was
that
we
thought
that
it
held
that
there
was
no
judicial
review.
i
thought
that
after
that
argument
was
completed
that
all
sides
including
the
government
apparently
had
conceded
that
statutes,
deportation
statutes
could
be
tested
as
to
whether
or
not
they
were
in
conflict
with
due
process.
the
government
has
since
filed
a
supplemental
brief,
however,
in
which
they
now
retain
to
the
more
extreme
position,
the
most
extreme
position
and
that
is
that
a
deportation
statute
having
been
passed
by
congress
is
entirely
immune
from
judicial
review
at
all,
for
any
purposes
or
any
reasons.
mr.
david
rein
substantive
due
process,
that's
correct
or
so
far
as
i
can
see
of
any
other
position
of
the
constitution,
that
as
a
matter
of
law
they
say
entirely
within
the
political
discretion
of
congress
and
cannot
be
reviewed
for
congress
--
by
this
court
on
any
basis
or
ground.
the
argument
that
presents
on
behalf
of
that
theory
seemed
to
fall
into
two
categories.
the
first
one
is
the
statement,
that
an
alien
having
come
here
for
residence,
has
no
vested
right
to
remain
here.
since
he
has
no
vested
right
to
remain
here,
presumably
according
to
the
government,
his
privilege
of
remaining
here
can
be
taken
away
from
him
for
any
reason,
for
no
reason
or
for
bad
reasons.
now,
i
think
that
on
the
face
of
it
that
argument
cannot
stand
up.
certainly
the
constitution,
and
this
court
has
held
repeatedly,
protects
people
from
the
deprecation
of
privileges
which
do
not
fall
in
the
category
of
vested
rights.
we
can
give
only
a
few
examples
and
i
think
in
the
recent
decisions
of
this
court,
the
wieman
and
the
slochower
cases
in
which
what
was
involved
was
the
privilege
of
government
employment,
there
was
certainly
no
vested
right
of
government
employment.
the
schware
case
decided
by
this
court
last
term
involved
what
must
be
considered
to
be
the
privilege
of
becoming
a
member
of
the
bar.
there
was
a
person
who
was
not
even
a
member
of
the
bar
and
it
was
held
that
he
could
be
denied
the
privilege
of
becoming
a
member
of
the
bar,
except
on
rational
grounds.
so
that
the
concept
of
--
there
is
no
vested
right
it
seems
to
me,
it
does
not
meet
the
argument
that
the
depravation
of
the
privilege
not
be
subject
to
ordinary
constitutional
limitations.
the
second
argument
presented
by
the
government
is
that
deportation
statutes
are
immune
from
judicial
review
because
they
are
linked
with
foreign
relations
and
i
think
that
really
seems
to
be
the
gist
of
their
argument.
now
we
say
that,
that
notion
in
that
court
is
completely
unrealistic,
as
related
to
the
alien
in
this
case
or
related
with
a
great
majority,
the
overwhelming
majority
of
aliens
in
this
country.
i
think
it's
common
place
to
say
that
we
are
a
nation
of
immigrant
aliens,
that
aliens
who
come
into
this
country,
come
in
as
immigrant
aliens,
with
the
notion
of
living
here
for
the
rest
of
their
lives.
the
government's
brief
seems
to
depend
on
a
theory
of
dealing
with
a
class
of
people
who
have
come
here
for
a
very
transitory
purpose,
as
though
they
are
flitting
in
and
out,
that
talks
about
people
as
being
a
temporary
guest,
as
though
they
were
visit
in
someone's
house.
now
that's
certainly
not
potential.
the
alien
here
is
not
only
typical.
he
came
here
43
years
ago.
mr.
david
rein
well
i
think
what
is
relevant
to
the
argument
is
the
fact
that
the
aliens
--
mr.
david
rein
no,
but
i
think
--
mr.
david
rein
i
think
--
mr.
david
rein
no
i
think
being
43
here
demonstrates
the
chief
point,
is
that
he
no
longer
has
any
meaningful
ties
with
the
country
of
his
origin
and
that
the
notion
raised
by
the
government
that
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
only
real
argument
they
give
is
to
how
foreign
relations
might
come
into
the
picture
is
that
aliens
here
are
a
possible
source
i
think
they
say
of
political
complaint
by
the
country
of
their
origin.
significantly
they
give
no
examples
and
no
concrete
examples
in
which
there
have
been
political
complaints
by
other
countries.
significantly
we
know
that
the
problem
involved
with
aliens
like
the
plaintiff
here,
like
the
petitioner
here,
who
came
here,
to
point
is
he
came
here
permanently.
if
he
was
only
50
years
old
he
may
have
only
been
here
20
years,
being
73
years
old
he's
been
here
43
years,
the
point
is
he
came
here
to
build
his
life
here
and
to
stay
here
permanently.
he
is
not
a
transient.
he
has
no
ties.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
record
here
shows
that
in
the
earlier
period
of
1938
involving
an
earlier
deportation
proceeding,
he
could
not
be
deported
because
he
was
stateless.
now,
congress
itself
in
passing
this
statute
and
in
passing
other
deportation
statutes
never
took
into
consideration
the
argument
presented
here
by
the
government
that
somehow
these
deportation
statutes
have
something
to
do
with
our
relations
of
foreign
countries,
that
deporting
aliens
might
as
the
government
say
eliminate
the
source
of
political
complaints.
mr.
david
rein
i
don't,
the
government
does.
mr.
david
rein
well
i
must
that
i
start
off
with
the
assumption
and
i
must
start
off
with
the
assumption
that
deportation
statutes
like
any
of
the
statute
of
congress
is
judicially
reviewable
to
see
whether
or
not
it
is
in
conflict
with
the
constitution.
mr.
david
rein
well
the
only
reason
why
i
spend
a
minute's
argument
is
because
the
government
takes
the
contrary
position.
now
the
question
is
then,
if
it
is
judicially
reviewable,
the
question
is,
is
this
statute,
does
it
meet
the
requirements
of
the
constitution?
the
government
and
i
say
again,
i
would
agree
that
the
only
reason
why
when
i
even
mentioned
this
subject
is
because
the
government's
position
is
that
it
is
not
judicially
reviewable
at
all
under
any
circumstance.
mr.
david
rein
well
i
think
your
honor
that
probably
that
gets
us
to
what
seems
to
be
the
government's
second
point
and
its
retreat
let's
say.
its
phrase
contention
is
that
it
is
not
judicially
reviewable
at
all
and
perhaps
the
government
is
trying
to
express
the
second
thought
that
if
judicially
reviewable.
the
standards
by
which
deportation
statutes
are
to
be
judged
are
lower
that
to
say
than
the
standards
by
which
this
court
would
have
judged
statutes
governing
government
employment.
i
must
say
on
that,
in
addressing
myself
to
that,
that
it
has
always
been
my
notion,
and
i
think
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
time
and
time
again
that
this
court
never
set
aside
any
statute
whether
of
congress
or
of
the
state
unless
those
statutes
are
wholly
arbitrary
and
without
any
rationale
basis
and
we
submit
that
that
is
the
only
standard
we
are
asking
the
court
to
apply
in
this
case.
we
are
not
asking
them
to
substitute
their
judgment
for
congress.
we
are
asking
only
to
examine
this
statute
to
see
whether
or
not
in
accordance
with
the
normal
standards
of
constitutional
law,
this
standard
can
stand
up
as
having
any
rationale
basis
whatsoever.
and
we
submit
that
if
that
standard
is
employed,
this
statute
cannot
meet
the
test
because
deportation
statutes,
if
they
have
any
meaning
or
significance
whatsoever
and
if
they
are
to
have
any
basis,
well
only
as
indicated
in
the
cases
itself
the
power
of
congress
to
rid
this
country
of
undesirable
aliens,
aliens
who
have
shown
in
one
way
or
another
that
they
are
no
longer
desirable
residents
of
this
country.
mr.
david
rein
we'd
submit
that
has
to
be
done
on
the
same
rationale
basis
that
this
court
would
indicate
as
to
who
is
or
who
is
eligible
to
become
a
member
of
the
bar
as
this
court
said
in
schware
case.
secondly
and
--
on
that
aspect
of
the
case
this
court
was
unanimous
in
which
it
said
that
although
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
it
is
a
matter
in
which
this
court
cannot
interfere
as
to
who
can
be
the
member
of
the
bar
of
new
mexico
when
the
standards
that
it
employed
are
so
arbitrary
and
so
completely
without
any
basis
and
reason,
this
court
will
set
aside
that
standard
as
being
a
violation
of
the
due
process.
i
think
that
that
type
of
test
is
the
same
type
of
test
that
should
be
applied
here.
mr.
david
rein
no
that
would
be
a
different
problem
your
honor.
mr.
david
rein
no
we
have
a
different
problem.
in
the
first
place
the
government
attempts
to
assimilate
throughout
its
argument
exclusion
legislation
with
expulsion
legislation.
we
submit
that
they
come
under
completely
different
standards
as
to
whom
this
country
--
who
congress
will
not
permit
to
come
into
this
country
and
who
congress
wishes
to
expel
after
having
admitted
them
for
lawful
residence
and
i
think
the
reason
for
that
--
mr.
david
rein
well
i
think
that
that
would
raise
another
question.
people
who
have
been
lawfully
admitted
here
and
under
a
statute
not
admitting
them
to
citizenship
this
court
might
very
well
examine
that
and
find
that
it
has
no
rationale
basis.
i
think
it's
possible
for
the
court
and
it
is
the
duty
of
this
court
to
examine
such
statutes
and
i
don't
think
why
--
mr.
david
rein
with
that
whatever
the
purpose
of
congress
is
in
those
particular
cases,
whatever
congress
maybe
bring
before
this
court.
mr.
david
rein
no,
no.
mr.
david
rein
no
this
court
can
tell
congress
in
a
hypothetical
case
if
there
maybe
that
the
standards
that
you
have
set
have
no
rationale
basis.
mr.
david
rein
their
stated
purpose
of
what
the
purpose
of
not
naturalizing
these
particular
people
maybe,
and
rationale
exercise
of
constitutional
power
of
naturalization.
and
that
there
be
a
rationale
connection
between
the
group
of
people
whom
they
are
denying
nationalization
to
and
the
purposes
of
that
congressional
power.
now
the
standard
to
be
applied
here
is
if
we,
if
we
go
on
the
assumption
which
we
must
that
the
power
of
congress
to
deport
is
limited
or
is
based
upon
its
power
to
rid
this
country
of
undesirable
aliens,
present
the
undesirable
aliens,
this
court
has
that
standard
to
judge
whether
or
not
that
a
particular
case
here
if
there
is
any
rationale
relationship
to
that.
and
if
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
--
congress
comes
and
says
they
wish
to
deport
people
because
they
are
irish,
or
because
they
are
catholic,
it
would
be
for
this
court
to
say
that
has
no
rationale
relation
if
the
court
thought
so.
now
maybe,
there
maybe
a
set
of
facts,
circumstances
i
don't
know,
i
am
not
arguing
those
hypothetical
cases,
but
i
think
the
test
is
there
and
the
test
is
for
this
court
to
apply
and
i
think
the
test
is
to
be
applied
in
this
case
--
mr.
david
rein
i
say
that
this
statute
must
be
based,
measured
by
the
same
standards
that
--
mr.
david
rein
the
question
is,
not
the
basis,
not
the
basis
of
the
discrimination
which
congress
employs,
but
that
the
standard
is
the
legitimate
standard
which
congress
is
entitled
to
employ,
which
is
that
the
aliens
are
undesirable.
to
give
another
example
if
congress
wishes
to
deport
all
those
with
red
hair
they
do
not
have
the
problem
of
religion
in
that,
but
it
certainly
would
be
appropriate
for
this
court
to
say
whether
or
not
an
individual
had
red
hair
has
not
rationale
relationship
to
whether
he
is
desirable
to
--
mr.
david
rein
that
is
this
case.
mr.
david
rein
that
is
this
case
and
i
think
if
there
is
any
question
about
it
--
mr.
david
rein
falls,
falls.
mr.
david
rein
no,
because
the
fact
is
that
this
particular
statute
is
going
to
head
for
rowoldt
and
a
great
many
other
people
of
the
same
caliber.
mr.
david
rein
no,
no.
mr.
david
rein
that
shows
really
how
blind
the
statute
is
because
--
mr.
david
rein
the
statute,
no
but
this
court
has
said,
it
said
in
wieman,
it
said
in
others
that
once
congress
passes
a
statute
in
which
there
is
indiscriminate
grouping
of
the
innocent
and
the
guilty
that
statute
must
fall.
in
other
words
if
congress
wants
to
pass
a
statute
which
can
muster
and
pass
the
test
of
constitutionality
that
statute
itself
must
have
a
statement
of
culpable
characteristics
in
it
which
would
eliminate
on
its
face
people
like
rowoldt.
the
vice
of
this
statute
is
that
it
covers
people
who
are
members
of
the
communist
party
and
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
for
how
long
or
when
they
were
or
what
their
purposes
were
or
what
their
activities
were
and
how
innocent
they
were.
now
i
think
that
--
mr.
david
rein
no.
mr.
david
rein
no
i
would
not
have
the
court
say
this.
well
i
would
indicate
what
i
would
have
the
court
say.
i
would
have
the
court
say
that
for
statute
of
this
kind
to
be
constitutional
it
must
be
limited
to
people
who
belong
to
the
organization
at
the
time
that
it
advocated
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence
with
evidence
produced
of
that
in
the
case
and
he
must
have
had
knowledge
of
it
and
participated
in
it,
and
that
would
be
the
issue,
and
that
--
mr.
david
rein
no,
no.
i
did
not
address
myself
to
the
point
of
the
knowledge
of
this
individual's
advocacy
or
--
mr.
david
rein
yes.
mr.
david
rein
but
not
on
that
issue,
because
under
the
statute
--
mr.
david
rein
under
the
statute
that
issue
was
irrelevant.
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
communist
party
advocated
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence
at
the
time
of
this
membership
is
irrelevant
under
this
statute.
mr.
david
rein
i
am
arguing
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute.
now
if
your
honor
wished
to
say
that
it
will
--
this
court
would
take
a
different
view
as
to
what
the
statute
says,
and
the
statute
makes
a
person
deportable
on
the
ground
of
having
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
without
showing
anymore
than
that,
and
that's
what
galvan
sustained.
now,
if
the
court
wishes
to
save
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
to
indicate
that
it
must
meet
other
requirements,
i
would
have
no
argument
for
that.
mr.
david
rein
well
the
issue
remains
to
what
the
statutes
says.
i'd
save
my
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
rein
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
davis
says
that
there
are
two
possible
inferences
from
this
record
as
to
whether
the
petitioner
was
or
was
not
a
nominal
member
and
that
the
administrator
has
the
right
to
make
the
choice
of
inferences.
if
the
administrator
had
that
right
nothing
is
clear
than
that
he
did
not
exercise
it.
in
this
record
there
are
three
opinions
of
the
administrator,
an
opinion
of
the
special
inquiry
officer
who
was
the
hearing
examiner,
an
opinion
of
the
chief
of
the
adjudications
division
and
an
opinion
of
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
and
if
the
court
will
read
those
opinions,
it
is
perfectly
plain
that
each
one
of
those
officials
thought
that
the
only
question
was
whether
the
individual
ever
was
any
--
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
nothing,
no
appreciation
at
all
is
shown
of
such
a
thing
as
whether
or
not
he
was
more
than
a
nominal
member.
the
things
that
mr.
davis
relies
on
in
arguing
to
this
court,
as
proving
more
than
nominal
membership
are
not
even
mentioned
in
two
of
the
opinions
in
holding
that
the
evidence
is
sufficient
to
show
membership.
the
opinion
of
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
does
not
mention
the
fact
that
mr.
rowoldt
sold
books
in
a
bookstore.
it
does
not
mention
the
fact
that
he
went
down
to
city
hall
and
asked
for
relief.
the
same
thing,
neither
of
those
items
are
mentioned
in
the
opinion
of
the
chief
of
the
adjudications
section.
the
opinion
of
the
hearing
examiner
mentions
it
incidentally,
but
the
hearing
examiner
makes
a
finding
that
membership
in
the
communist
party
is
established
independently
by
each
of
two
separate
documents.
one
of
those
two
documents
is
the
statement
that
rowoldt
gave
to
the
immigration
examiner
which
the
court
is
fully
familiar.
the
other
is
the
bare
statement
in
rowoldt's
application,
earlier
applications
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
which
all
he
said
was
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
that
he
had
left
the
communist
party
in
1936.
so
that
the
hearing
examiner
himself
felt
that
merely
one
statement,
the
statement
that
he
had
once
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
was
enough
to
prove
deportability
under
this
statute.
so
if
the
administrator
has
a
right
to
make
the
choice,
he
did
not
make
it
and
if
anything
more
is
needed
to
prove
that
it
is
what
the
history
of
the
garcia
case.
in
garcia
the
solicitor
general
opposed
certiorari.
it
was
only
after
this
court
decided
galvan
in
the
government's
favor
and
only
after
the
court
granted
certiorari
in
galvan
that
the
solicitor
general
decided
that
perhaps
there
was
some
obscurity
in
the
evidence.
and
it
is
plain
now
that
at
least
at
times,
because
i
think
mr.
davis'
concept
of
nominal
membership
has
varied
from
time
to
time,
that
at
least
the
deprives
of
his
argument,
the
government
as
represented
by
him
is
still
applying
the
wrong
meaning
of
nominal
membership,
because
if
i
heard
him
rightly
he
is
still
says
at
times
at
least
that
it
is
enough
to
make
a
person
a
nominal
member
if
he
knows
the
correct
name
of
the
organization.
if
he
knows
that
the
organization
had
the
name
of
communist
party
and
wasn't
--
didn't
have
the
name
of
workers
alliance,
that's
enough
to
make
him
more
than
a
nominal
member.
mr.
david
rein
well,
i
would
have
trouble.
i
think
a
nominal
member,
i
haven't
--
is
i
would
say
that
i
can't
do
anything
any
better
than
justice
frankfurter
did
in
his
opinion
in
galvan
and
i
do
say
that
applying
that
this
man
is
not
more
than
a
nominal
member.
he
didn't
do
anything
as
a
communist.
he
didn't
do
anything
that
is
peculiar
to
communist.
he
didn't
do
anything
which
involved
communist
ideology.
so
therefore
he
is
a
nominal
member.
mr.
david
rein
well,
it
wouldn't
satisfy
mine,
but
it
is
possible
that
it
might
satisfy
the
definition
as
well.
mr.
david
rein
i
think
that
would
make
a
difference.
mr.
david
rein
well
this
is
perfectly
clear
--
mr.
david
rein
i
think
so,
but
i
would
add
this
one
thing,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
man
when
he
joined
the
communist
party
according
to
this
record,
he
wasn't
pledging
himself
not
to
continue
to
vote
for
the
republican
or
democratic
party
even
contrary
to
a
candidate
for
the
communist
party.
he
didn't
think
of
it
as
a
political
organization
in
that
sense,
he
thought
of
it
is
as
an
action
organization
for
a
limited
specific
purpose.
now
let
me
get
on
one
other
subject.
the
discussion
here
on
constitutionality
has
been
exclusively
on
the
question
of
rationality
and
due
process.
but
if
this
man
is
deported,
the
critical
facts
which
make
him
deportable
according
to
the
government's
argument
are
that
he
went
to
the
court
house
to
ask
for
relief
for
the
communist
party,
said
the
government,
although
maybe
he
went
there
for
the
workers
alliance,
he
wasn't
an
officer
the
workers
alliance
and
that
he
sold
books
in
a
bookstore
for
the
communist
party,
these
books
happened
to
be
books
by
strachey,
marx
and
lenin
and
similar
books,
these
books
--
the
sale
of
these
books
are
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
nobody
claims
different,
these
are
not
obscene
books
however
one
may
disagree
with.
mr.
david
rein
well
i
think
it
is
no
secret
that
mr.
strachey
had
changed
his
views
and
at
that
time
he
wrote
the
books
that
the
communist
--
that
mr.
rowoldt
sold
that
he
believed
in
different
principles
than
he
believed
in
there.
mr.
david
rein
well
i
would
interpret
his
books
differently.
mr.
david
rein
yes,
but
the
selling
of
those
books
is
an,
was
an
action
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
but
going
to
the
court
house,
the
petitioning
authority,
was
an
action
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
fifteen
years
later
a
statute
is
passed
which
places
on
this
man
this
dire
penalty
of
exile
from
a
country
in
which
he
buried
his
wife
and
he
buried
his
child,
a
country
where
he
has
lived
his
whole
mature
life
for
nothing
more
than
the
exercise
of
rights
under
the
first
amendment.
now
i
say
leaving
aside
the
question
of
rationality
to
me
i
see
nothing
rational
about
that,
leaving
aside
the
question
of
rationality
that
is
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
and
galvan
may
i
point
out
didn't
even
discuss
the
question
of
the
first
amendment.
and
in
originality
the
first
amendment
was
found
satisfied
i
think
wrongly
solely
on
the
ground
that
the
organization
which
was
condemned
or
membership
in
which
it
was
condemned
was
prescribed
in
terms
of
an
advocacy
to
which
no
social
value
was
attached.
mr.
david
rein
i
--
mr.
david
rein
well
it
is
true
that
the
statute
can't
be
invalidated
because
of
my
notion
under
any
--
mr.
david
rein
--
but
it
more
than
a
question
of
application
--
mr.
david
rein
because
as
mr.
rein.
mr.
david
rein
as
mr.
rein
pointed
out
generally
earlier
a
statute
which
is
so
broad
as
to
comprehend
protected
and
unprotected
conduct
must
be
set
aside
because
the
very
existence
of
that
statute
on
its
face
inhibits
people
from
exercising
their
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
david
rein
well,
well
i
don't
know
about
that,
but
this
is
a
statute
in
which
the
proportions
are
in
reverse.
this
is
a
statute
in
which
the
deportation
cases
which
have
come
before
this
court
show
and
in
which
our
statistics
in
our
appendix
show
that
is
the
1000
people
who
are
being
deported
for
exercising
first
amendment
rights
and
maybe
only
one
and
not
even
that
one,
in
any
event
as
applied
to
this
individual
--
mr.
david
rein
it
shows
a
1000
people
who
did
no
more
than
join
the
communist
party,
an
activity
which
this
court
stated
in
american
communications
association
against
douds
is
per
se
by
itself
is
not
connected
towards
any
bad
activity
protected
by
the
first
amendment
because
this
court
knows
and
the
whole
world
knows
that
whatever
maybe
said
about
the
communist
party,
whatever
maybe
charged
against
it,
it
does
and
it
has
engaged
in
a
great
deal
of
protected
activity
--
mr.
david
rein
well
i
think
not,
i
think
that
if
this
statute
violates
the
accepted
principles
of
the
first
amendment,
my
time
has
expired
--
mr.
david
rein
i
say
it
does
--
mr.
david
rein
i
say
it
does,
it
does
violate
the
first
amendment
as-applied
in
this
case
and
i
say
that
the
defense
--
that
the
application
of
the
statute
is
so
tailored
that
the
statute
is
so
tailored
for
such
application
that
it
is
clear
that
the
statute
as
a
whole
should
be
set
aside.
there
is
already
a
statute
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
david
rein
in
galvan
the
majority
opinion
stated
that
if
the
court
were
to
examine
this
question
with
a
clean
slate
it
would
very
likely
decide
that
this
is
something
that
shocks
the
conscience
of
this
statute.
it
is
something
that
shocks
the
conscience
and
therefore
would
violate
due
process.
mr.
david
rein
your
honor
i
can
just
give
my
understanding
of
galvan,
your
honor
wrote
it,
all
i
can
say
is
that
that's
what
read
in
it.
i
read
in
galvan
that
the
court
said
or
intimated
that
the
statute
shocked
its
conscience
but
that
shock
has
seem
to
been
absorbed
by
what
the
court
considered
to
be
prior
decisions
of
the
court.
in
one
of
efforts
in
our
brief
was
to
show
that
that
was
not
a
correct
reading
of
a
prior
decision
in
the
court.
and
if
i
may
just
conclude
with
one
sentence,
we
also
think
it
is
a
very
serious
subject
as
to
whether
this
statute
is
a
bill
of
attainder
and
violates
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
we
think
that
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
saying
that
deportation
cannot
under
any
circumstance
and
regardless
of
the
cause
of
the
punishment
that
those
prior
decisions
be,
those
general
decisions
are
wrong
in
reason
and
are
contrary
to
the
interpretation
of
bill
of
attainder
and
ex
post
facto
clause
in
more
(inaudible)
decisions
of
the
court.
