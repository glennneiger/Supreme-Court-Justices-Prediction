am
i
right
in
calling
that
the
ferguson
amendment
was
--
delete
--
deleting
enactement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
prevailed
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
accepted
by
senator
mccarrran.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
amendment
was
the
deletion
of
something
that
patently
was
qualified.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
the
comments
that
was
put
by
senator
ferguson
are
relevant
to
the
construction
of
a
statute
that
i
have
to
comment
of
an
individual
member.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
whether
the
voluntary
statement
from
which
you
read
the
essentials,
extract
the
duplicate
--
justice

--
where
they
rely
on
whether
that
was
the
whole
--
that
was
all
there
was
before
the
immigration
authority
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
including
that
he
was
supposedly
a
member.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
his
statement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
asked
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
specific
question
whether
there
was
anything
except
this
statement
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
we
then
have
(voice

--
justice
felix

when
he
says
or
does
the
rest
of
the
statement
shed
any
light
on
his
book
shop
as
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
it
concerned
--
he
wasn't
getting
opinion
and
it
incidentally
what
he
lived
or
for
--
what
he
--
by
what
he
was
sustained?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
the
government
saw
that
he
got
nothing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix

(voice

except
to
disciple
that
he
likes
and
currently
that
he
just
needs
a

and
consults
with
the

justice

and
i
think
this
--
i
know
but
he
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
mean
to
say
he
has
no
mean
to
substantiate
but
then
he
--
did
all
his
words
gave
us
anything
to
a
cause
without
running
infiltration.
justice

(voice

anything
more
except
what
you
read
on
that
point.
justice

it

it

it

(voice

justice

i
don't

justice

all
right.
justice

so
do
you
think
that
changes
--
he
would
have
shaved
it
down
to
six
months?
and
to
think
that's
the
way
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rein,
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
apparently,
when
was
he
arrested
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
was
he
arrested
for
purposes
of
deportation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

he
was
originally
arrested
in
1935.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
happened
between
1935
and
the
present
date?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
his
state
--
his
statement
of
30
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
one
you
read?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
be
--
and
as
to
--
he
was
arrested
in
1935.
what
happened
to
that
arrest?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
was
he
mentioned
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
hearing
officer's
conclusion
didn't
come
until
may
in
1951
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
which
he
says
that
the
petitioner
remained
in
--
a
member
of
the
communist
party
which
he
have
joined
said
it
was
spring
or
a
summer
of
1935
until
he
was
arrested,
so
that
the
arrest
means
1935.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
we're
dealing
with
--
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
not
the
arrest,
a
determination
on
arrest
in
this
deportation
proceeding
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
what
this
thing
you
are
saying
from
1935
to
1948.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
as
far
as
the
record
shows
when
he
was
--
when
he
quit
--
in
1935,
he
quit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
our
case
--
our
second
when
you
came
down
in
the
spring
of
1939.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
remembered.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
it
was
--
came
down
and
i
was
a
member
of
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can't
tell
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
all
i'm
saying
is,
you
can't
tell
what
was
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
because
it
didn't
reveal
its
mind
by
a
disclosure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
decisions,
i'm
talking
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
don't
you
stand
fast
on
senator
ferguson?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
did
your
best
in
saying
--
in
saying
that's
--
that
could
be
more
than
this
and
can
be
less
than
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
without
into
it
--
he
mentions
stretchy
ahead
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
that?
i
didn't
hear
your
last
statement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
suppose
that
anybody
could
read
galvan
and
think
it
says
that
wherein
comes
the
deportation,
congress
can
do
unconstitutional
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
galvan
means
that
it
would
say,
all
few,
they're
all
catholics
in
1940.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
the
case
could
be
read
another
way.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
means
it
must
--
although
congress
has
the
power
it
has
to
decide
how
an
army
could
be
composed,
it
can
provide
that
there
should
be
no
catholic
or
jewish
office
until
this
day.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
the
basis
to
your
argument.
your
whole
brief
reads
that
and
under
this
statutes,
it
could
say
to
--
it
could
deport
for
all
jews
or
catholics.
justice
felix

no,
i
say
to
you.
the
communist
--
and
because
it
has
this
great
war
power
that
say
no
jew
or
catholic
--
justice

--
could
be

could
be

justice

well,
war

is
at

as
broad
as
the
--
justice

frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
does
it
say
that?
it
says
the
opposite
as
to
speak
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
something
was
meant
to
be
conveyed
by
political
discretion.
does
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
congress
--
we
might
say
that
due
process
clause
precludes
recognition
of
certain
and
this
is
not
relevant
because
people
are
affected
by
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
suggest
that
that
kind
of
extreme
logical
argument
is
not
very
illuminating
in
dealing
with
a
very
important
problem.
justice
felix

that's
right.
justice
felix

only
--
only
catholics
abused
could
be
deported?
justice

mention
what
it
--
it
does
to
eminent
domain
anymore
than
just
to
settle
other
powers
of
congress.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
you're
on
a
sound
ground
when
you
say
the
opinion
wasn't
well
written
and
we
got
a
lot
from
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
trouble
you
to
tell
me,
i
ought
to
know
but
i
don't?
what
was
before
the
immigration
--
before
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
other
than
the
hearing
officer
(inaudible)
and
the
affidavit?
justice

nothing
before
the
hearing
officer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
question
was
what
was
there
before
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
in
addition
to
what
--
would
have
before
the
hearing
officer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
far
as
the
record
goes,
there's
nothing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
all
goes
back
to
the
hearing
officer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
to
say
the
judgment
isn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
isn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
relevant,
all
i'm
saying
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
so
far
as
evidence
goes
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
nothing
--
all
we
have
is
what
was
before
hearing
officer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
15,
1951.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how's
that
a
fair
inference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
is
a
fair
inference
that
--
that
he's
under
the
party
discipline
after
they
ordered
him
to
do
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
from
the
word
"coercion"
but
i
understood
he's
suggesting
that
one
has
a
right
to
know
that
a
party
has
discipline
as
that
is
may
gave
command
without
a
coercion.
maybe
that's
a
fine
language
or
--
but
(inaudible)
go
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
we
have
is
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
the
bookshop
is
what
it
says
here
that
he
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
very
fact,
if
i
may
interrupt,
indicates
the
multiple
or
alternative
motives
of
people
in
joining
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
agree
with
that.
that's
--
that's
one
thing
about
the
party.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
since
the
statement
that
you
made,
i
think,
scrupulously
acted
many
--
affect
others,
when
it
comes
to
the
--
to
judge's
individual
conduct,
you
can't
rest
merely
on
the
opinion,
that's
the
allowable
opinion
and
i
concern
of
congress
in
regard
to
the
party.
justice
felix
frankfurter
interpreting
it
all
automatically
to
the
individual.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
one
get
that
--
would
one
get
that
from
that
--
from
the
remark
of
senator
ferguson
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
communist
by
conviction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
is
that
paragraph
ambiguous,
stretching
the
notion
of
ambiguity
to
suggest
that
he
meant
this
to
cover
merely
incoming
aliens?
justice
felix
frankfurter
after
all
while
one
ought
not
to
say
the
congress
would
like
something
instead
of
clearer

considered
the
(inaudible)
to
say
that
that
perspective
to
incoming

justice

--
or
to
resident
aliens.
justice
felix

i
appreciate
that
but
nothing
is
more
common
that
--
and
that
legislation
should
be
broader
than
the
immediate
occasion
of
(inaudible).
justice
felix

let
me
--
let
me
put
this
to
you,
mr.

assume
that
you
suggest
that
senator
ferguson,
who's
the
(inaudible)
assume
that
his
phrasing
or
his
remarks
are
ambiguous.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
the
--
the
agreement
with
him
by
senator
mccarran
carries
into
the
agreement
that
ambiguity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
assume
further
that
the
regulation
in
iii
is
ambiguous
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
could
you
--
could
you
roll
over
on
that
part?
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
then
if
that
is
so,
if
you
have
those
ambiguities
both
in
these
underlying
statutes
and
in
the
regulation
meaning
to
give
its
administrative
means
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
you
have
that
ambiguity,
then
considering
the
nature
of
the
case,
the
subject,
all
that
is
involved
in
(inaudible)
isn't
the
duty
to
construe
the
--
resolve
the
ambiguity
(inaudible)
severely?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
must
make
a
distinction,
i
suggest,
between
entertaining
those
motive
benevolently
and
entertaining
them,
if
i
may
say
so,
selfish.
in
other
words,
if
the
motive
involved
his
--
him
not
as
a
--
as
an
informer,
whether
he's
a
human
being
who
wants
to
get
wealth
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
he
says
that
he
came
hand
in
hand
with
the
communist
party
(inaudible)
if
it
involved
him
directly
as
a
human
being
in
need,
then
you
got
a
different
situation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
from
a
benevolent
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
on
that
cause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
suggest
that
the
galvan
opinion
is,
i
suspect,
preoccupied
with
the
particular
fact
in
that
case.
and
the
particular
facts
in
that
case
were
very,
very
(inaudible)
particular
fact.
in
the
first
place,
his
defense
was
that
he
never
joined
the
party.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
already
shed
light
on
the
fellow
who
is
then
(inaudible)
established
or
if
he
did
join
it,
he
--
he
didn't
(inaudible)
force
and
violence
that
he
did
join
--
i
mean
he
responded
to
join.
he
responds
to
an
organizer
who
is
viewed
to
be
an
organizer.
he
attended
meetings.
he
(inaudible)
and
there
was
the
other
supporting
--
stronger
supporting
evidence
of
his
activity
in
the
party
affairs.
well,
a
fellow
who
says,
"i
didn't
join
it,"
and
then
you
have
evidence
that
--
that
he
did
all
the
things
within
it,
raises
questions
that
--
that
he
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

i
--
i
--
on
the
whole,
i
--
correct
me
if
my
summary
was
inaccurate.
but
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
fellow
is
(inaudible)
to
join
it
and
says,
"but
if
i
did,
i
don't
know
what
it
was,"
didn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
to
rest
down
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
we
know
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
chief
justice
has
indicated
so,
and
that
all
he
had
is
his
affidavit
(inaudible)
that's
what
it
gets
down.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all
the
government
has.
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
rely
of
his
own
mouth
is
voluntarily.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
you
have
to
take
it
as
it
is
that
you
can't
believe
something
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
and
you
say
you
have
a
bookstore
of
that
kind,
did
he
say
he
run
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
bothers
me
is
there's
no
inquiry
made
that
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
record
was
no
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
the
light
of
the
thing
that's
very
emphatic
maybe
that
this
is
the
bread
and
butter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
imlay,
before
you
sit
down,
we,
lawyers,
have
been
trying
to
be
accurate
in
different
language
but
i
got
the
impression,
you
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
that
except
in
the
matter
of
phrasing,
there
wasn't
any
difference
between
you
and
mr.
justice
black
in
his
interrogatory
to
you
about
burden
of
proof
because
i
got
what
you
said,
which
is
why
i
am
asking
questions,
you
would
disagree
with
him
that
when
the
record
is
all
in,
it's
the
government's
task
to
establish
that
he
was
"a
member".
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
you
used
the
word
"probative
value".
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
if
the
government
must
make
out
its
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
determining
whether
it
has
made
it
out
(inaudible)
differ
of
course.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
the
government's
job
to
make
out
its
case
that
this
fellow
is
a
member
in
the
particular
offense
in
which
that
term
is
used
in
that
statute
with
the
content
that
must
be
given
to
it
considering
the
kind
of
a
statute
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
didn't
use
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
use
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
for
instance
you
just
had
--
"yes,
i
joined
the
communist
party
if,"
there's
one
--
another
question
is
put
to
you,
"i
joined
the
communist
party
if,"
and
that's
all
the
government
has.
one
--
a
real
question
would
be
raised
whether
the
government
has
made
out
his
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
the
question.
the
question
is
whether
communist
can
constitutionally
exercise
that
power
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
not
whether
it's
rationally
say
that
is
true.

justice

before
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
whether
why
you
so
readily
agreed
when
you
were
asked
whether
the
statute
says
"join"
and
that's
joining
communist
party.
the
statute
doesn't
say
that,
the
statute
says
members.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
we
have
to
construe
(inaudible)
members
of
affiliated
(inaudible)
in
the
context
of
this
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
not
a
mathematical
term.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rein
may
i
ask
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
page
10,
the
portion
you
just
read,
“that
is
why
we
never
thought
much
of
joining
those
parties
in
those
days.”
what
am
i,
how
am
i
to
read
that,
what
do
those
parties
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
all
you
have
in
that
is
all
i
have,
but
i
was
just
wondering
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
legitimately
be
drawn
from
those
words?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wasn't
asked
by
the
officer
what
he
meant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
all
we've
got.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
just
saying
–-
justice
felix
frankfurter
part
of
my
question
was
calculated
to
bring
out
the
--
we
haven't
gotten
any
more
than
we
got?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
you
would
want
to
add,
wouldn't
you
mr.
rein
that
senator
mccarran's
reference
to
colyer
against
skeffington
is
all
the
more
significant
in
that
portion
of
judge
anderson's
decision
were
appealed
by
the
government
and
were
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals
but
not
these
portions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
galvan
isn't
a
judicial
exception.
justice
felix
frankfurter
galvan
is
a
recognition
of
a
legislated
definition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
other
side
of
it
is
the
clear
statement
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
prove
that
the
particular
individual
himself
wanted
to
overthrow
this
government?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
even
that
he
must
be
assumed
to
share
in
the
general
purpose
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
namely
that
like
a
man,
they
belong
to
one
of
the
two
great
parties
and
yet
disbelieved
in
most
of
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words
what
senator
mccarran,
not
only
was
he
promoter
of
the
(inaudible),
what
he
says
(inaudible)
the
view
of
his
general
attitude
for
this
type
of
legislation,
senator
mccarran
doesn't
say
this
statute
merely
includes
(inaudible)
joining
without
knowing
because
then
you
have
no
problem,
that
the
(inaudible)
act
aren't
this
act.
the
exception
he
makes
is
a
man
who
in
fact
did
join
and
yet
that
isn't
enough.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
suppose
even
people
who
reject
marxism
presumably
have
a
speaking
acquaintance
with
what
they
are
rejecting.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
would
have
to
go
on
some
such
grounds
to
prevent
an
fbi
man
who
is
not
a
citizen
but
is
in
there
to
report
to
the
fbi
who
then
joins
and
works
in
a
bookstore
and
read
marx,
more
than
this
fellow
presumably
has
read,
you
would
have
to
go
to
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
fbi
man.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
(inaudible)?
do
you
think
it's
relevant
to
the
argument
that
it's
43
or
30?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
--
i
appreciate
that
the
element
of
hardship,
but
do
you
think
if,
you
say
here
23,
the
problem
for
us
is
any
different?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
this
constant
appeal
to
43
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
points
out
the
hardship.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
it
make
a
--
i'm
just
wondering
why
you
discussed
thing
so
abstractly
as
you
do?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
even
though
the
government
does,
(inaudible)
would
it
make
any
difference
if
congress
said
anybody
who
hasn't
taken
out
citizenship
within
ten
years
after
coming
here
and
then
has
(inaudible)
this
qualification
shall
be
deported,
would
that
make
a
difference?
how
can
you
talk
about
this
question
in
this
great
big
large
way
whether
deportation
is
at
all
--
statutes
of
the
deportation
of
judicial
review,
or
that
you
ring
the
changes
on
43
aliens?
i
can
assure
i
feel
badly
about
that
as
you
do,
but
it
doesn't
touch
this
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wouldn't
think
that's
worth
spending
a
minute
of
argument,
it's
so
clear
that's
it
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
judicially
reviewable
is
very
ambiguous
and
treacherous
phrase.
if
you
mean
then
it
be
brought
to
the
bar
of
this
court
and
ask
this
court
to
say
that
it
does
or
doesn't
conflict
with
some
provisions
of
the
constitution
there
isn't
anything
that
can
be
brought
to
the
bar
of
this
court.
if
you
mean
by
judicially
reviewable
can
we
sit
in
judgment
on
an
exercise
of
policy
by
the
congress,
that's
a
different
story.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
how
do
you
determine
who
is
and
who
isn't
desirable?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
helps
me
to
decide
whether
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
constitutional
power
that
no
asiatic
should
enter
this
ground,
is
that
unconstitutional?
justice
felix
frankfurter
never
mind
what
i
think
about
that,
i
think
very
ill
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
the
statute
not
admitting
them
for
citizenship
ever,
how
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
rationale
with
reference
to
what?
may
i
know
with
reference
to
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
this
court
can
tell
congress
who
can
be
naturalized
and
who
can't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
who
being
incapable
of
being
naturalized
shouldn't
stay
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
rationale
with
reference
to
what,
i
ask
you
again?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
think
this
case
is
just
like
saying
every,
every
non-citizen
catholic
or
jew
to
be
deported,
that's
this
case,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
what
the
same
standard
is
if
the
standards
are
different.
if
they
are
different
they
are
not
sustained.
if
a
discrimination
is
based
on
religion,
it
is
same
as
the
discrimination
based
on
something
else
then
they
are
the
same,
but
if
religion
is
in
a
different
category
according
to
the
whole
concept
of
our
society,
then
it's
not
the
same
standard.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that's
this
case,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is,
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
about,
you
mean
this
particular
rowoldt
or
the
statute
under
which
he
falls.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
are
very
different
to
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
it
is
a
question
of
a
quantitative
determination
of
how
many
people,
for
how
many
people
it
would
be
a
hardship
for
congress
to
pass
a
statute
that
otherwise
conscientious
legislators
on
the
hill
could
have
passed
and
did
pass.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
we
have
no
means
of
determining
how
many
people
are
73
years
old,
how
many
people
have
been
x
years
or
x+y
years
or
x-y
years,
everyone
of
those
considerations,
we
would
be
called
upon
to
assess
that
with
the
same
kind
of
(inaudible)
with
more
blindness
than
congress
had.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
block
the
blindness
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
you'd
have
this
court
say
if
they
had
lifted
only
a
year
before
–-
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that's
a
long
one,
two
years
before
yes,
three
years
before
we'd
have
to
think,
five
years
before
we
would
be
clear.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
your
first
argument
leaves
that
question
and
doubt
whether
that
isn't
true
in
this
case,
because
the
first
part
of
your
argument
is
that
the
record
is
so
barren
that
a
judgment
on
those
questions
couldn't
be
based
on
it.
as
i
understand
that
was
your
argument
on
the
first
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understood
you,
you
said
the
record
is
so
barren
that
if
it
went
back
and
we
have
no
business
to
make
a
judgment
here,
if
it
went
back
a
totally
different
record
could
be
made
of
it,
wouldn't
you
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
we
may,
in
order
to
sustain
it,
we
would
construe
it
that
way
and
find
that
the
record
which
you
solicit
the
(inaudible)
may
bear
that
out
and
the
case
may
then
come
up
here
on
a
totally
different
record,
a
totally
different
statutory
construction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
saying
on
this
record,
if
we
follow
the
first
part
of
your
argument,
we
can't
make
out
that
determination,
that's
what
i'm
saying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
marshalling
of
the
evidence
in
the
galvan
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
just
by
--
for
the
sake
of
interest,
in
the
tisi
against
tod
thought
i'd
refresh
my
recollection
of
that,
(inaudible)
forgotten
that
in
that
case
the
alien
was
present,
he
was
represented
by
counsel,
he
testified
fully,
there
was
examination,
cross-examination,
regular
adversary
proceedings.
justice
felix
frankfurter
sorry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
record
on
which
you
rely
he
did
testify,
i
mean
he
did
give
evidence
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
he
was
examined
and
that's
all
you've
got.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
gravamen
of
the
problem
which
you
are
going
to
discuss
(inaudible)
is
was
that
means
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
“member,”
so
that
they
don't
gain
anything
from
the
fact
that
he
said
in
the
habeas
corpus
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
evidence
of
that
--
give
evidence
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
if
anybody
else
made
the
suggestion
i'm
pretty
--
i
certainly
didn't
mean
--
but
mostly
to
imply
that
he
was
coerced
in
what
he
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i
was
suggesting
is
that
what
he
said
is
awfully
meager
and
exiguous.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
davis
if
i
may
say
so,
you're
a
very
scrupulous
lawyer
and
very
fastidiously
careful
of
your
responsibilities
of
the
court
(inaudible)
in
the
course
of
the
argument,
but
you
said
he
ran
the
bookstore.
but
if
you
take
the
full
testimony,
one
sees
a
little
(inaudible)
attached
to
a
word
like
that,
you
said
i
ran
it,
why
did
you
run
it?
241
(inaudible),
“what
sort
of
bookstore?”
(inaudible),
“did
you
own
the
bookstore?”
“no,
i
didn't
get
a
penny
there.”
q,
“what
was
the
arrangement
there?”
“hey
i
was
a
kind
of
a
salesman
and
there
was
the
communist
party
ran
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
saying
those
words,
one
has
to
weigh
them
very
carefully.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
appreciate
that,
that's
a
fair
statement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
very
different
for
him
to
say
very
assertively,
i
ran
that
shop
and
then
say
in
a
loose
way,
and
then
he
said
well
as
a
kind
of
a
salesman,
i
didn't
get
paid
anything.
for
all
i
know
of
what
you
might
have
elicited,
but
they
said
if
you
want
us
to
give
you
food,
you
go
and
spend
three
hours
or
four
hours
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
inspector
didn't
either
that's
my
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
hopes
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
a
purpose,
a
purpose
within
what
senator
mccarran
said
may
so
(inaudible),
all
those
physical
acts
that
may
illuminate
those
acts.
you
get
a
different
significance,
anything
(inaudible)
yes
i
joined
it,
i
take
you,
so
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it?
i
ran
a
bookstore.
that
isn't
this
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
would
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
--
and
i
don't
understand
what
(inaudible)
talking
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
davis
may
i
suggest
that
you
intellectually
(inaudible)
what
subject
(inaudible)
of
what
seems
to
me
the
(inaudible)
and
judge
anderson
was
dealing
here,
namely
of
whose
platform
and
preferences
they
have
no
real
knowledge.
the
essence
for
the
business
in
cases
of
judge
anderson
was
that
these
fellows
didn't
--
had
no
knowledge
of
the
platform
and
purposes,
no
real
knowledge
and
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
differentiate
between
putting
down
the
time
of
those
fellows,
the
socialist
party
and
putting
up
the
time
in
the
communist
party
and
this
fellow
so
far
as
the
record
goes,
hearing
somebody
will
get
you
bread
and
thing
(inaudible)
for
that.
i
don't
see
that
one
man
has
anymore
real
knowledge
of
platform
and
preferences
than
the
other.
that
qualification
can
be
very
important
to
us
and
i
stress,
i
don't
mean
to
ring
the
changes
too
much,
but
the
fact
that
senator
mccarran
yielded
to
that
argument
is
for
me
as
may
refer
from
galvan
(inaudible)
powerful.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
referring
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
were
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh
yes,
look
at
the
woman,
i
forget
with
all
that
testimony.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
going
to
question
of
unlawfulness,
before
you
get
to
unlawfulness,
it
must
be
unlawful
about
something,
what
i'm
going
through
is
that
qualifying
phrase
to
which
i
called
your
attention
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
galvan
abstained
from
joining
because
he
didn't
want
authority
to
--
he
knew
it
was
an
undesirable
thing
to
join
--
not
undesirable,
dangerous
to
join
the
party.
that's
a
very
different
thing
for
a
man
going
around
making
a
speech
when
all
the
farms
in
iowa
were
knocked
down
for
nothing
and
farms
were
burnt
and
(inaudible)
mortgages
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
think?
that
almost
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
complete
indifference,
complete
indifference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
do
agree
that
one
must
find
in
what
appears
in
this
little
record
and
allow
it
on
the
basis
to
say
that
he
had
a
purposeful
interest
in
that
party,
(inaudible)
party.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
party?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
and
you
must
have
know
perhaps
now,
but
i
know
(inaudible)
extremely
otherwise
intelligent
people
were
non-political,
were
not
interested
in
any
other
party,
but
it
would
be
in
if
it's
in
a
particular
crowd
that
said
we
are
going
to
get
bread,
are
we
going
to
get
an
opera
house
from
washington?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
not
a
purposeful
interest
in
the
party
as
a
party.
a
party
means
carrying
out
political
objectives.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
indicating
to
you
the
difference.
he
knew
enough
that
he
didn't
want
to
join
it,
because
it
would
hurt
him,
the
woman
who
was,
i
forget
her
name
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
fellow's
testimony
is
only
indifferent
to
parties,
but
an
affirmative
reason
of
the
most
pressing
kind
of
economic
needs,
to
be
fulfilled.
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
all
you
know
this
maybe
true
in
this
case.
is
that
a
general
indication
that
here
people
all
about
it,
and
all
i
know
(inaudible)
were
in
need
of
daily
support,
daily
sustenance,
see
that's
the
(inaudible)
for
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
think
that
no
rationale
inference
the
other
way
could
be
drawn?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
think
that
no
rationale
inference
the
other
way?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
is,
then
there
comes
into
play
the
general
attitude
which
this
court
had
laid
down,
not
only
as
to
de-nationalisation
cases
but
as
to
deportation
cases.
you
want
to
(inaudible)
before
deport
on
conflicting
evidence,
but
tisi
and
tod
is
to
me
a
very
different
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
that
he
must
have
conscious
--
that
he
was
violating
the
law,
that's
out
as
far
as
i'm
concerned.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
he
say
anywhere
i'm
asking,
i
don't
know,
did
he
say
anywhere,
yes
i
was
a
communist
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
never
said
i
am
a
communist.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
known
people
who
joined
republican
and
democratic
clubs
(inaudible)
like
myself
in
order
that
they
may
come
within
that
kind
of
a
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
know
but
a
fellow
like
that
wouldn't
say
i'm
a
republic
or
a
democrat,
he'd
say
i'm
a
job
hunter?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
i
preserved
for
you
mr.
davis
is
whether
after
galvan
the
departments
issued
instructions
to
the
inquiring
order?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
davis
you
may
proceed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
mr.
davis
whether
in
those
cases,
the
cases
you
thus
compare,
there
were
affirmative,
efficient,
a
rather
efficient
of
the
(inaudible)
dominating
reasons
for
the
(inaudible)
joining
whatever
this
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
winder
if
you
are
talking
about
the
same
thing,
i
mean
the
assertion
of
rowoldt
as
to
why
he
joined,
not
the
negative
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
absolute
relief
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
not
any
indication
that
he
knew
what
the
purpose
was,
but
whether
in
those
cases
in
the
record,
of
a
statement
of
the
conscious,
i
mean
exact
words,
of
the
drive,
of
the
purpose,
of
the
desire,
of
the
aim
of
the
preoccupation
of
joining?
justice
felix
frankfurter
almost
nothing
is
to
me
a
very
different
thing
from
an
assertion
of
a
contrary
affirmative.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
each
record
is
a
record
by
itself
that
one
would
have
to
read
the
whole
of
this,
wouldn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that,
your
point
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
he
didn't
care
whether
(inaudible)
his
mind
wasn't
--
didn't
advert
to
what
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
wrong
in
thinking
of
them
as
almost
pro-forma.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
whether
the
hearing
before
the
special
inquiry
officer,
holds
more
--
is
that
this
a
fair
(inaudible)
of
what
goes
on
or
does
the
fellow
when
(inaudible)
doesn't
go
out
and
ask
some
more
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
talking
about
the
"47"
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
mean
is
this
is
fair
sample
of
or
are
you
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
unfairness.
i'm
suggesting
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
somewhere
it
says
he
wanted
to
get
out
of
this
country.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
wouldn't
that
make
a
difference,
what
would
be
so
that
he
thought
he
was
joining
a
political
party?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words
if
he
said
yes
i
know
they
called
themselves
a
party,
here
it
is
that's
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what,
if
he
said
yes
i
knew
all
about
it,
i
heard
that
speeches,
i
didn't
believe
any
of
that
stuff,
but
what
i
hear
about
is
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
strachey
would
be
greatly
troubled
if
you
inquiry
"he
was
a
communist
or
a
pseudo
communist
or
anything
except
an
opponent
of
communism,
he'd
be
greatly
troubled
particularly
if
he
thinks
if
you
are
going
to
be
a
member
of
the
british
government.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
believed
in
a
common
front
is
a
different
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
not
suggesting
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
couldn't,
you
couldn't
on
this
last
argument
of
yours
mr.
(inaudible)
invalidate
the
statute
but
merely
say
that
its
applications
of
this
situation
offends
your
notion
of
the
first
amendment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
it
applies
to
this
situation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
if
this
may
cover
a
thousand
people
without
touching
the
first
amendment
it
may
cover
one
whom
it
does
touch
the
first
amendment
the
statute
must
be
declared
unconstitutional?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
certainly
your
statistics
don't
show
a
1000
people
worked
and
distributed
books,
would
you
say
the
distribution
is
protected?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
american
douds
had
nothing
to
do
with
aliens,
if
you
say
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
you
are
an
alien
or
a
citizen
all
these
things
around,
really
we
are
opening
up
a
nice
(inaudible)
instead
of
being
a
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
that
isn't
what
galvan
is,
galvin
is
something
else,
galvan
addresses
itself
to
the
ex
post
facto
law,
it's
a
different
problem
again.
