mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well,
either
as
you
wish,
your
--
mr.
chief
justice.
i'll
start
now.
i
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
i
would
just
like
briefly
if
i
may
to
give
the
first
--
give
the
questions
presented.
the
first
question
for
which
this
court
granted
certiorari
as
whether
the
petitioner
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
as
that
term
was
defined
by
this
court
in
galvan
versus
press.
or
whether
he
had
been
only
a
nominal
member
and
therefore
not
subject
to
deportation.
and
two,
whether
or
not
withstanding
galvan,
the
statute
providing
for
deportation
of
aliens
for
past
membership
in
the
communist
party
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
or
as
applied
to
the
facts
in
this
case.
as
i
understand
petitioner's
position
he
accepts
the
--
the
--
that
part
of
the
galvan
versus
press
opinion
which
goes
to
the
construction
of
section
20
--
section
22
of
the
internal
security
act
of
1950.
but
for
purposes
of
question
too,
he
rejects
the
--
the
constitutional
holding
in
that
case.
i
might
just
say
very
briefly
that
this
case
--
the
petitioner
was
first
ordered
deported
in
1936
on
the
ground
that
he
was
a
member
of
an
organization
which
advocated
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence
under
the
1918
act,
that
was
the
communist
party.
and
as
we
have
already
developed
here,
that
--
at
the
time
that
he
was
arrested
in
--
within
--
in
those
deportation
proceedings
at
the
end
of
1935,
he
left
the
communist
party.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
first
like
to
review
the
background
of
the
administrative
proceedings,
deportation
proceedings
in
this
case
and
to
summarize
the
evidence
upon
which
the
order
of
deportation
is
founded.
at
the
close
of
yesterday's
session,
i
believe
i
had
pointed
out
that
--
of
course,
the
deportation
charge
here
is
that
the
petitioner
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
in
1935.
now,
going
back,
i
--
i
would
like
to
just
briefly
summarize
the
previous
administrative
proceedings
leading
up
to
the
hearing
and
the
granting
of
the
orders
of
deportation
now
attack.
petitioner
was
first
ordered
deported
in
1936
on
the
basis
of
membership
and
an
organization
advocating
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
and
after
this
court's
opinion
in
kessler
versus
strecker
in
which
this
court
decided
that
the
1918
act
applied
only
to
present
membership
in
the
--
in
an
organization
advocating
overthrow
of
the
government.
in
1942,
these
proceedings
were
canceled.
the
kessler
case
was
in
1939,
and
the
court
will
recall
that
the
alien
registration
act
of
1940
was
passed
the
next
year
in
order
to
extend
the
policy
of
--
of
the
1918
act
to
pass
membership
in
organizations
advocating
overthrow.
subsequently,
new
proceedings
were
commenced
in
1948
under
this
1940
law
and
these
proceedings
were
invalidated
by
this
court's
decision
in
wong
yang
sung
versus
mcgrath
because
the
--
this
1948
proceedings
didn't
comply
with
the
administrative
procedure
act.
then,
after
congress
had,
in
the
appropriation
act
of
1951,
exempted
deportation
hearings
from
the
administrative
procedure
act,
a
new
hearing
was
commenced
on
february
16th,
1951
at
which
time
an
additional
charge
under
the
section
22
of
the
internal
security
act
of
1950
was
lodged
against
the
petitioner.
and
the
petitioner
was
given
time
he
--
that
hearing
--
that
february
16th
hearing
was
adjourned
at
march
28th,
1951
to
allow
the
petitioner
time
to
meet
the
additional
charge.
i
might
say
this
--
this
time
of
--
at
the
time
of
this
march
28th
hearing,
march
28th,
1951,
the
--
well,
the
same
day
that
that
hearing
was
conducted,
the
act
of
march
28th,
1951,
which
we've
set
forth
at
page
3
of
our
brief,
became
law.
i
think
that
perhaps
our
brief
is
a
little
misleading
because
i
think
we
stated
that
this
act
become
law
before
the
hearing.
well,
actually,
it
became
law
the
same
day
that
the
principle
hearing
in
this
case
was
held.
this
act
of
march
28th,
1951
was
a
clarifying
act.
i'll
get
--
i'm
going
to
discuss
the
legislative
history
of
that
act
throwing
light
on
the
1950
act
in
a
few
minutes.
at
this
second
hearing,
well,
at
the
first
hearing,
the
petitioner
admitted
his
alienage
and
that
he
was
last
a
citizen
of
germany.
and
at
this
march
28th
hearing,
he
refused
to
answer
whether
he'd
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
or
whether
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
in
1935.
he
was
represented
by
counsel
at
this
hearing
and
at
all
subsequent
proceedings.
when
the
--
when
petitioner
refused
to
state
his
membership,
the
--
the
service
introduced
two
documents
into
evidence.
the
exhibit
5
was
a
verified
copied
of
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
dated
november
8th,
1949
in
which
the
petitioner
admitted
that
in
truth
and
fact,
he
had
seized
membership
in
the
communist
party
usa
in
1935.
the
petitioner
refused
to
answer
whether
he
files
such
a
petition.
he
made
an
objection
to
the
admission
of
this
petition
on
the
grounds
of
--
that
it
wasn't
material.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
no,
it
isn't,
your
honor.
it's
merely
adverted
to.
in
the
hearing
officer's
decision,
the
hearing
officer
states
that
he
faced
his
--
his
decision
partly
on
that
exhibit
5
and
partly
on
exhibit
4.
now,
exhibit
4,
which
was
introduced
into
evidence
on
that
hearing,
was
the
sworn
testimony
of
the
petitioner
given
before
an
immigration
inspector
on
january
10th,
1947.
and
the
transcript,
which
is,
of
course,
printed
in
the
record,
in
the
transcript,
it
was
--
petitioner
admitted
that
he
was
an
alien,
last
a
citizen
of
germany.
and
after
being
sworn,
this
is
in
1947,
he
admitted
that
he
joined
the
communist
party
and
another
organization,
the
workers'
alliance
in
the
spring
or
early
summer
of
1935.
he
also
admitted
that
he
paid
dues
in
the
party
and
he
attended
meetings
where
the
members
talked
about
fighting
for
the
daily
needs.
he
gave
his
--
his
reason
for
joining
on
page
26
of
the
record.
the
fact
that
the
communist
party
had
one
aim
to
get
something
to
eat
for
the
people
and
that
everybody
around
me
had
the
idea
that
we
had
to
fight
for
something
to
eat
and
clothes
and
shelter.
in
a
subsequent
portion
of
the
record,
page
31,
he
further
explained
that,
in
answer
to
a
question
as
to
whether
he
joined
--
whether
he's
joining
the
communist
party,
he
was
motivated
by
dissatisfaction
and
living
under
a
democracy
that
it
wasn't
that
no
--
that
it
was
just
a
matter
of
having
no
jobs
at
that
time,
and
he
stated,
"we
wanted
something
to
eat
and
something
to
crawl
into."
and
then
he
was
asked,
“you
say
you'd
fight
for
something
to
eat
and
crawl
into,
what
do
you
mean
by
that
term?”
then
he
explained
this
statement,
"we
had
to
go
and
ask
those
who
had
it."
that
was
the
courthouse
at
that
time.
we
petitioned
city,
state
and
national
government.
we
did
and
we
succeeded.
we
finally
got
unemployment
laws
and
a
certain
budget.
even
at
the
few
communist
meetings
i
attended,
nothing
was
ever
said
about
overthrowing
anything.
all
they
talked
about
was
fighting
for
the
daily
needs.”
then
he
was
asked
whether
he
was
an
active
worker
in
the
communist
party.
and
he
replied,
“the
only
active
work
i
did
was
running
the
bookstore
for
a
while.”
and
then
as
was
--
we
--
mr.
rein
discussed
yesterday,
he
--
he
admitted
that
he
didn't
get
a
penny
there,
that
he
was
a
salesman
in
there
but
the
communist
party
ran
the
store.
he
secured
his
employment
through
the
communist
party.
and
this
store
was
an
official
outlet
for
communist
literature
in
minneapolis,
minnesota.
and
he
also
explained
that
this
bookstore
handled
many
of
the
communist
classics
and
socialist
literature.
petitioner
dropped
out
of
the
communist
party
when
he
was
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well,
i
--
i
would
say
this.
of
course,
we
--
we
must
remember
that
he
was
an
alien
who
--
who
was
--
who
joined
the
communist
party
in
the
spring
or
summer.
and
he
was
in
the
party
a
--
a
fairly
short
time.
i
think
the
petitioner
maintains
that
it
was
six
months,
other
--
there
was
another
statement
in
the
record
that
it
was
approximately
one
year.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
and
--
the
finding
--
the
hearing
officer,
i
think
--
i
think
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
stated
that
petitioner
is
--
has
repeatedly
stated
that
he
was
in
the
communist
party
six
months.
the
hearing
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
there
is
in
the
record
his
statement
that
he
joined
the
party
in
the
spring
or
summer
of
1935
and
that
he
left
at
the
end
of
1935
when
he
was
arrested
in
deportation
proceedings.
of
course,
that
--
that
is
a
little
low
for
six
months
perhaps,
but
in
any
event,
the
--
his
--
the
tenure
of
his
membership
was
between
six
months
and
a
year.
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
no.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
no,
there
isn't,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
to
my
--
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor,
just
the
--
the
exhibits
that
appeared
of
record,
the
exhibit
4
and
5.
exhibit
4
is
his
transcript
and
exhibit
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
that
does
not
appear
in
the
record,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
that's
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
that's
--
that's
correct,
your
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
there's
no
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
there
was
no
--
no
finding
that
he
was
a
communist
by
conviction.
the
--
the
finding
was
merely
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
within
the
meaning
of
section
22
of
the
internal
security
act.
the
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
no,
there
was
not,
mr.
justice
black.
i
--
i
might
explain
this
though
that
the
--
at
the
time
the
hearing
officer
made
his
decision,
there
was
a
regulation
of
the
service
enforced
which
--
which
we've
had
printed
at
page
38,
footnote
15
of
our
brief.
this
regulation,
which
was
in
effect
at
the
time
the
hearing
officer
rendered
his
report,
implements
or
--
or
carries
forward
the
--
the
mandate
of
the
clarifying
act
of
1951
which
was
printed
at
page
3
of
our
brief.
this
regulation,
of
course,
defines
the
terms
"members
of"
for
purposes
of
administering
the
act
of
october
16th,
1918
as
amended.
that
regulation,
of
course,
provides
that
where
"members
of"
is
used
in
this
act,
it
shall
include
only
membership
or
affiliation
which
is
or
was
voluntary
thereby
excluding
involuntary
membership
which
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
that
excludes
coerced
membership
and
i
--
it
could
exclude
unknowing
membership
where
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
--
besides
this
it
was
citing
--
excluding
involuntary
membership.
it
itemizes
three
categories
of
membership
which
are
intended
to
be
excluded
from
the
definition
and,
of
course,
where
aliens
have
joined
the
party
or
communist
organizations
went
under
16
years
by
operation
of
law
and
for
purposes
of
obtaining
employment,
food
rations
or
other
essentials
of
living
and
where
necessary
for
such
purposes,
that
last,
that
category
iii,
petitioner
tries
to
place
his
case
within
that
category.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
the
date
of
the
findings,
let's
see,
just
a
moment.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes,
the
--
just
a
moment.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes,
the
findings
were
in
may
15th,
and
this
regulation
was
in
april.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
the
regulation
followed
the
actual
hearing,
that's
correct.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
that
is
correct.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well,
he
--
of
course,
his
activity
in
the
party,
his
principle
activity
was
in
this
bookstore,
and
he
stated
that
he
didn't
get
a
penny
for
his
work
in
the
bookstore.
i
think
a
fair
inference
is
that
he
was
a
volunteer
there
in
the
bookstore.
and
there
are
other
statements
in
the
record
that
showed
that
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well,
he
--
he
stated,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
he's
secured
this
employment
through
his
membership
in
the
communist
party.
there's
no
evidence
as
to
whether
he
was
coerced,
whether
there
were
some
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
--
discipline
that
induced
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes,
he
--
he
also,
of
course,
attended
meetings.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well,
i
--
i
suppose
that
there's
nothing
--
he
--
he's
--
i've
been
addressing
myself,
of
course,
to
the
contention
that
he
joined
the
party
out
of
some
compelling
economic
necessity.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
now
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well,
yes,
he
did.
he
says
it
now.
he
--
he
didn't
say
it
at
the
time
of
the
immigration
proceedings.
he
raises
it
here
in
this
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well,
i
--
i
think
that
--
that
might
--
that
has
its
explanation.
he
--
he
did
say
that.
i
suppose
that
he
did
say
that
he
was
doing
it
to
obtain
bread
and
so
forth,
philosophical
bread
because
he
--
he
does
state
that
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
he
explained
that
when
it
--
when
--
he
was
asked
about
his
statement
that
we
wanted
bread
and
something
to
crawl
in.
he
explained
it
this
way,
"we
had
to
go
and
ask
those
who
had
it."
that
was
the
courthouse.
"we
petitioned
city,
state
and
national
government.
we
did
and
we
succeeded."
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
in
other
words
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
it
was
for
relief,
that's
correct.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
he
--
he
was
interested
in
--
in
bettering
society,
perhaps.
the
communist
party,
as
we
know,
often
has
had
a
very
meritorious
objectives
at
times
as
an
attraction
to
particularly
minority
troops.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
that's
--
that's
correct.
the
--
there
are
many
motives
in
joining.
i
think
further
on
in
my
--
this
course,
however,
i
--
i
wont
get
to
the
legislative
intent
here.
i
--
i
do
believe
that
congress
regarded
the
communist
party
as
something
more
than
a
--
an
organization
that
attracts
the
casual
joiner.
i
think
it
is,
as
you,
yourself
mentioned,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
a
well-disciplined
organization.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
that's
correct,
and
i
think
that
distinction
was
made
in
the
galvan
case
where
--
the
galvan
case,
of
course,
pointed
out
the
membership
where
the
--
where
the
member
joins
the
party
of
his
own
freewill
where
this
--
where
there
aren't
these
elements
of
involuntary
or
--
or
coercive
motivations.
that
membership
alone
is
enough
to
--
to
deport
--
deportation.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes,
it
does.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
i
think
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes,
you
could,
for
this
reason
that
the
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
--
the
congress
has
found
that
the
communist
party
for
30
years
past
has
--
has
been
dominated
by
the
international
organization.
and
it
has
--
it
has,
in
its
legislative
comments,
refused
to
recognize
in
the
light
of
subsequent
developments
new
studies
made
before
the
1950
act
that
the
communist
party
was
ever
the
--
the
party
of
sweetness
and
light,
pardon
the
expression,
that
it's
--
it's
tried
to
assume.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well,
it's
stated
in
our
galvan
brief
where
we
outlined
the
--
the
history
of
the
--
of
section
22.
in
page
47
of
our
galvan
brief,
we
set
--
we
set
forth
fairly
extensively
quotations
from
the
--
a
report
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee
that's
senate
report
2230
of
the
81st
congress,
second
session.
the
report
states,
"it
is
a
well-established
fact
that
both
the
leadership
and
membership
of
the
communist
party
is
recruited
overwhelmingly
from
alien
ranks.
during
the
course
of
its
30
years
of
existence
in
this
country,
the
communist
party
has
been
ruled
exclusively
by
alien
agents
appointed
by
the
communist
international
headquarters
in
moscow.
the
high
commander
of
the
party
in
this
country
invariably
has
been
dominated
by
aliens
or
persons
of
foreign
origin.
now,
section
22
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well
we've
printed
it
at
page
47
of
our
brief
in
the
galvan
case.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
it
comes
from
a
--
a
senate
judiciary
report,
senate
report
2230
of
the
81st
congress.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well,
not
exactly,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
it's
a
--
it's
a
comment
made
after
thorough
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
--
investigation
into
the
matter.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
congress
has
chosen
to
hold
him
responsible,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
a
political
decision,
whether
we
think
it's
justified
that
it
might
be
a
question
as
this
court
--
the
court
has
said
in
harisiades
and
galvan.
this
--
this
policy
might
be
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
that's
--
that's
true.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well,
as
i
say,
the
--
we
do
certainly
concede
that
there
are
many
cases
of
involuntary
membership
and
circumstances
such
as
are
listed
here
in
the
regulation
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
i
think
that
a
mere
intent
to
better
the
social
conditions,
the
economic
conditions
of
society
generally
is
not
enough.
i
think
congress
intended
this
category
iii
to
apply
particularly
to
those
people
who
joined
because
of
--
of
extreme
economic
necessity.
i
think
the
--
the
history
of
this
1951
clarifying
act
shows
that.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
that's
correct.
he
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well,
he
--
i
might
say
this.
he
did
--
he
did
--
the
only
reason
for
joining
was
to
help
most
of
the
people,
he
said.
he
didn't
have
any
idea
apparently,
and
i
don't
think
the
record
shows
that
he
had
any
intended
all
of
gaining
any
personal
benefit
out
of
his
membership.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
that
--
that
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
that
is
correct.
the
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
we've
set
forth
in
our
--
our
brief
the
legislative
history
of
the
--
of
this
1951
clarifying
act.
now,
the
1950
act
didn't
really
define
the
term
"member".
at
the
time
after
1950,
in
fact,
it
was
a
--
somewhat
of
a
dispute
as
to
what
the
term
"member"
meant
within
the
context
of
--
of
section
22
of
the
internal
security
act
and
that
particularly,
in
regard
to
the
administration
of
the
--
of
the
exclusion
provisions
of
section
22,
and
the
department
of
justice
took
the
view
that
"member"
was
to
be
given
a
very
literal
interpretation
in
administering
the
exclusion
on
provisions.
and
consequently,
even
involuntary
members
of
the
communist
party
were
being
excluded.
the
state
department
took
a
more
liberal
view
of
the
meaning
of
the
term
"member"
within
the
context
of
section
22.
and
the
anomalous
situation
was
created
where
the
state
department
was
issuing
visas
for
the
admission
of
certain
aliens
especially
from
the
soviet-dominated
countries,
and
the
department
of
justice
was
excluded
them
--
excluding
them
or
--
or
admitting
them
for
a
temporary
admission
only.
now
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes,
we
have
set
forth
various
legislative
comments
particularly
of
senator
mccarran,
the
sponsor
of
the
1951
legislation
in
which
he
--
this
--
he
throws
some
light
on
--
on
what
is
meant
here.
now,
i
started
to
say
that
certain
bills
were
introduced
to
clarify
what
the
term
"member"
meant.
they
would
do
this
by
permitting
--
by
providing
that
the
attorney
general
would
have
the
power
to
issue
regulations,
which,
as
i've
shown,
were
subsequently
issued,
clarifying
this
term.
now,
congress
--
the
--
these
first
bills
that
were
introduced
to
clear
up
the
term
"members"
only
would
have
applied
to
members
of
non-communist
prescribed
organizations.
this
was
--
by
amendment
was
changed
by
amendment
of
senator
ferguson
from
the
floor
at
the
time
of
the
consideration
of
the
1951
legislation
to
extend
to
members
of
all
totalitarian
organizations
and
excuse
such
members
when
they
were
children
by
--
or
those
who
became
members
by
operation
of
law
or
those
who,
for
purposes
of
obtaining
employment,
food
rations,
or
other
essentials
of
living,
had
joined
the
communist
organization.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
that's
right.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
that's
correct.
in
other
words,
what
congress
was
interested
in
here
was
to
take
care
of
--
of
those
party
--
or
those
communist
organization
members
who
were
coming
in
from
totalitarian
countries
where
membership
in
a
communist
organization
was
a
minimum
condition
of
subsistence.
and
that
is
the
--
that
is
what
they
primarily
had
in
mind.
now,
senate
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
senator
ferguson's
remarks,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
are
somewhat
ambiguous
in
that
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes,
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
--
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that
the
--
that
these
changes
would
have
been
restricted
only
to
incoming
aliens
but
the
specific
problem
that
was
before
congress
here
related
to
incoming
aliens
and
the
problems
that
were
created
by
lack
of
sufficient
definition
of
the
word
"member".
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
that's
--
that's
correct.
and
of
course,
congress
here
did
--
did
--
the
result
of
the
--
this
congressional
inquiry,
of
course,
was
the
act
of
march
28th,
1951.
now,
altering
this
legislative
discussion,
the
difference
between
involuntary
members
and
voluntary
members
of
the
party
was
consistently
pointed
up.
it
--
it
was
pointed,
for
instance,
that
our
policy
of
excluding
involuntary
members
was
having
an
adverse
effect
on
the
displaced
persons
program.
it
was
having
certainly
an
adverse
effect
on
the
--
on
the
admission
of
--
of
immigrants
from
the
iron
curtain
countries
because
it
was
practically
impossible
and
is
practically
impossible
to
exist
in
many
of
these
countries
without
joining
an
organization
that's
a
communist
--
a
communist-affiliated
list.
senators
aiken
and
nixon,
during
the
debate,
pointed
that
--
that
there
are
no
involuntary
members
to
the
communist
party
as
such.
they
--
they
made
a
fairly
broad
statement
in
that
respect.
and
i
--
i
don't
think
that
while
this
legislation
certainly
was
to
apply
to
--
to
deportation
cases
as
well
as
exclusion
cases,
the
--
the
difference
between
the
involuntary
and
the
voluntary
member
are
the
member
who
joined
of
his
own
free
will
and
the
member
who
was
forced
to
join
by
--
by
virtue
of
some
real
duress
is
constantly
pointed
out
in
the
--
in
the
discussion.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
i'll
assume
that's
it.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
that
--
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
however,
i
--
i
might
say
this
that
this
issue
really
has
been
discussed
in
the
galvan
case.
the
galvan
case
has
indicated
that
membership
where
the
--
where
the
member
joins
a
party
of
his
own
free
will,
i
think
the
--
the
--
your
decision
there
uses
that
language,
the
person
--
the
--
the
alien
involved
does
fall
within
section
22.
now,
there
are
many
cases
where
the
alien
has
not
joined
the
party
of
his
own
free
will
and
three
of
them
are
--
are
itemized.
i
--
i
think
the
--
there's
another
exception
pointed
out.
the
--
senator
mccarran
introduced
excerpts
from
the
case
of
colyer
versus
skeffington.
i'll
discuss
that
exception
in
a
moment
if
i
can
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
i
don't
think
that's
the
total
significance
of
that.
for
instance,
i
--
i
don't
think
it's
restricted
to
persons
in
foreign
lands.
i
--
i
think
it's
equally
applicable
to
deportation
cases
if
--
if
a
situation
really
arose
where
a
person
were
forced
to
join
the
communist
party
out
of
some
compelling
economic
needs,
i
think
he
would
be
eligible
for
this
section
3.
however,
i
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes,
well,
it's
--
it's
available
to
the
person
who
comes
here
from
a
foreign
land
with,
of
course,
his
past
membership
in
the
--
in
some
communist
organization
which
was
really
forced
upon
him.
he
--
he
had
to
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
if
--
if
joining
a
communist
party
was
a
minimum
condition
of
subsistence
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
--
i
would
say
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
perhaps
so.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
if
he
--
if
he
retreated
to
the
last
ditch
or
the
last
wall,
so
to
speak,
and
there
was
nothing
else
available,
if
the
communist
party
actually
was
acting
as
a
relief
agency,
so
to
speak,
and
if
he
turned
to
the
party
because
he
--
he
was
forced
to
do
so
by
virtue
of
--
to
--
to
get
subsistence,
that
would
be
such
a
case.
however,
it
would
be
a
--
a
very
limited
category
of
cases
that
that
would
reach.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
we
mentioned
his
activity
with
workers'
alliance,
yes,
that
was
a
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
that's
--
that's
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
--
correct.
that
s
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
that
is
correct.
they
had
certainly
and
i
--
his
--
his
activities,
but
the
parties,
certainly,
were
to
meet
the
problems
of
--
of
the
depression
which
were
certainly
very
much
evident
in
1935.
but
he
--
he
stated
quite
decisively
that
his
--
that
his
activities
were
for
the
benefit
of
most
of
the
people.
he
didn't
go
in
to
--
to
get
shoes
or
--
or
food
for
himself
or
--
or
even
pay.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well,
certainly
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
--
there's
--
there's
nothing
to
indicate
that
he
did
first.
secondly,
he
described
his
activities
in
the
bookstore
which
was
a
principal
and
activity
that
he
had
apparently,
he
said
he
didn't
get
a
penny
from
the
bookstore.
now
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes,
he
did.
and
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
--
that
--
that
certainly
is
a
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
he
was
trying
to
get
relief
from
most
of
the
people.
i
think
that
a
short
range
objective
of
the
communist
party
has
--
has
been
to
improve
the
economics,
of
course,
in
their
own
way
and
through
communist
party
action.
however,
i
don't
think
that
congress
intended
to
excuse
people
who
had
these
benign
motives
of
--
of
improving
the
economic
conditions
of
society
generally
by
virtue
of
this
1951
clarifying
act.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes,
i
--
i
believe
so.
there
--
there
was
the
--
of
course,
the
--
the
case
of
garcia,
which
is
adverted
to
in
our
brief,
the
--
the
court
will
remember
that
the
immigration
service
canceled
the
--
the
warrant
after
this
court
had
granted
certiorari
in
the
case
for
further
proceedings
to
--
to
ascertain
whether
garcia
was
in
fact
one
who
turned
to
the
communist
party
and
the
workers'
alliance
out
of
dire
necessity,
i
think
garcia
had
six
or
seven
children
at
the
time
he
joined
the
party
and
then
10
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
and
he
--
his
contention
--
and
there
was
an
ambiguity
on
the
record
which
--
which
warranted
a
further
reopening
of
the
proceeding.
there
was
an
ambiguity
on
the
record
in
that
respect.
he
contented
that
he
had
mistaken
the
--
the
--
well,
the
--
the
essence
of
his
contention
was
that
he
--
he
had
turned
to
the
party
out
of
dire
necessity
thinking
it
was
to
be
something
in
the
nature
of
a
relief
agency.
i
don't
think
that
--
that
however
is
this
case.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
i
--
i
--
that's
correct.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
mr.
justice
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
no.
that's
--
that's
true.
it
wasn't
--
this
--
this
wasn't
pointed
up
specifically.
the
contention
was
not
made
by
this
petitioner
that
he
was
only
a
nominal
member
or
an
involuntary
member
of
the
--
of
the
party.
he
never
took
that
position.
he
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
he
--
he
did
say
that,
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes,
he
took
the
position
when
he
testified
in
1947
that
--
that
his
--
his
--
he
was
unconcerned
with
any
political
objectives
of
the
party.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
he
was
either
unconcerned
or
oblivious
to
the
ultimate
political
goals
of
the
party,
the
use
of
force
and
--
and
revolutionary
methods
and
so
forth.
he
was
interested
in
one
phase.
he
was
like
--
very
much
like
the
petitioner
galvan.
galvan
also
contended
that
he
didn't
know
of
the
plans
and
purposes
of
the
party.
galvan
was
interested
in
the
--
a
fair
employment
practices
at
discussions
in
his
spanish
speaking
unit
of
the
--
of
the
communist
party.
in
--
and
i
--
i
think
that
the
galvan
opinion
does
it
--
limit
the
--
the
application
of
section
22
to
one
who
does
know
the
--
the
--
that
the
communist
party
has
this
--
advocates
the
--
the
use
of
force
and
violence.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
i
--
i
believe,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
he
said
he
didn't
join
the
party
but
if
he
did,
he
--
he
wasn't
aware
of
its
aims
and
purposes,
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
but
of
course
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
correct.
of
course,
galvan
didn't
run
a
bookstore.
he
--
i
--
i
don't
believe
that
he
is
--
he
--
his
activities
were
--
were
quite
as
important
as
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
--
the
petitioner,
rowoldt
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
true.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes,
he
did
say
he
run
the
bookstore.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
it
was
to
resolve
the
difference
between
the
interpretation
of
"member"
in
the
1950
act
between
the
department
of
justice
and
the
department
of
state.
as
i
say
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
that's
correct.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
--
i
suppose
that
congress
could
have
amended
the
1950
act.
but
what
i
think
--
i
believe
congress
was
intending
here
was
merely
to
--
i
don't
think
that
it
wanted
to
--
to
amend
the
--
the
act
because
it
understood
that
the
term
"member"
was
being
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
--
misconstrued
by
the
department
of
justice.
"member"
had
been
intended
to
--
to
mean
precisely
what
it
meant
before
1950.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
that's
correct.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
i
think
the
government
has
to
--
i
--
well,
the
immigration
service
has
to
produce
evidence
that
--
standing
by
itself
would
show
or
at
least
support
valid
inferences
of
the
hearing
officer
and
after
all
the
--
these
inferences
are
--
are
for
the
hearing
officer
to
make
and
not
the
court
in
collateral
inquiry.
i
think
the
government
would
have
to
--
to
show
a
case
which
--
lacking
any
rebuttal
but
would
--
would
show
that
--
that
the
particular
alien
was
a
member.
however,
i
do
think
that
if
the
alien
has
matters
which
constitute
matters
of
defense,
it's
incumbent
upon
him
to
come
forward
with
--
with
those
explanations
in
the
administrative
proceeding
rather
than
later
in
--
on
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
i
--
i
don't
think
the
government
is
required
to
negate
every
possible
explanation
he
might
make
matters
of
defense.
i
think
only
government
is
required
to
do
is
to
--
is
to
prove
maybe
a
prima
facie
case,
you
might
call
it,
of
membership
under
section
22.
now,
here,
the
contention
that
--
that
he
was
forced
into
joining
by
virtue
of
economic
necessities
and
the
contention
that
--
that
he
didn't
know
that
the
party
had
political
motives
beyond
the
immediate
economic
activities
with
which
he
was
concerned.
those
contentions
really
weren't
made
at
the
--
during
the
--
before
the
administrative
proceedings.
and
i
--
i
don't
know
that
they
can
be
saved
and
--
and
raised
before
the
courts
which
really
is
looking
at
the
issue
as
a
collateral
matter.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
it
--
and
on
his
explanations,
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
if
--
if
i
could
just
be
given
a
moment,
i
would
just
like
to
complete
the
facts.
there
was
the
--
the
--
there
was
the
statement
as
to
the
fact
that
he
wanted
to
petition
for
an
unemployment
relief,
he
wanted
to
go
to
government
agencies
and
--
and
do
things
which
ordinarily
would
be
considered
political
activities
and
narrowly
limit
it
perhaps
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
i
--
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
such
a
joining
wouldn't
be
necessary
for
the
purpose
of
getting
food
rations
and
so
forth.
the
fact
that
he
wanted
to
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
that
was
his
explanation,
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
no,
and
if
--
if
his
motives
--
if
his
benign
motives
in
joining
to
--
to
better
society
generally,
providing
an
excuse
that
--
that
would
be
available
to
him.
but
as
i've
tried
to
develop,
i
don't
think
that
congress
intended
to
--
to
provide
that
escape
provision.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well,
if
--
if
he
joined
to,
as
a
last
resort
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
i
--
i
don't
think
that
he
would
be
a
mere
nominal
member
just
because
of
those
motives,
no,
i
don't.
i
--
if
i
could
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
i
--
i
think
he
was
a
member,
yes.
i
--
i
don't
think
that
--
that
this
--
i
--
i
think
the
--
the
rationale
of
the
communist
generally
is
that
they
seek
to
promote
ultimate
social
reforms.
the
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
that's
correct.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well,
i
--
i
think
that
it's
the
government's
burden
to
--
to
produce
evidence,
which
upon
rebutted,
would
--
would
satisfy
the
property
to
create
a
proof.
i
think
the
government
--
the
evidence
would
have
to
be
reasonable,
substantial
and
probative.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
of
course,
the
--
i
--
i
think
the
--
really
the
standard
of
review
that's
prescribed
for
the
administrators
is
that
there'd
be
some
reasonable
substantial
and
probative
evidence
on
the
record
that
they
are
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
--
reviewing.
to
show
membership.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
voluntary
membership.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well,
that's
the
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
--
that's
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
i
don't
know
that
in
an
administrative
proceeding
of
this
type,
mr.
justice
black,
that
--
that
the
term
"burden"
is
--
is
entirely
appropriate.
i
--
i
think
that
a
--
a
case
couldn't
stand
unless
there's
a
reasonable,
substantial
and
probative
evidence.
now
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes,
and
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
no,
that
--
that's
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
that's
true.
it
certainly
can't
--
it
can't
rest
on
a
mere
presumption.
but
i
--
i
do
think
that
after
the
government
has
shown
a
type
of
membership
which
given
--
giving
the
--
the
administrators
the
--
the
right
to
make
a
reasonable
inferences
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well,
i
--
i
don't
really
think
that
the
--
the
government
has
the
task
of
negating
every
possible
defense
that
could
be
raised
either
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
bare
membership.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
membership
with
--
without
any
--
any
other
evidence
whatsoever
are
inferences
which
could
be
drawn
from
evidence
to
show
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
that
he
--
that
he
is
--
there
could
--
that
he's
--
that
he's
not
a
mere
nominal
member.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well,
perhaps,
there
are
many
circumstances
where
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
--
where
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
whether
in
--
under
the
circumstances
that
that
case
--
i
think
it
could
perhaps
be
shown
that
the
communist
party
doesn't
accept
persons
willy-nilly
in
certain
periods
more
than
others.
but
it
--
it
does
discriminate
and
if
it
were
shown,
if
there
were
something
on
that
record
to
show
that
--
that
he
didn't
drift
into
the
party
as
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
--
an
idle
joiner
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well,
i
--
i
don't
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
i
--
i
can't
really
state
that.
i
don't
think
the
case
has
come
up.
it
--
certainly
--
i
--
i
think
in
the
kessler
versus
strecker
case,
there
was
evidence
there
that
a
--
that
strecker
joined
the
party
and
then
failed
to
pay
dues.
all
there
was
in
that
case
was
a
card.
and
i
think
strecker
produced
some
evidence
to
the
effect
that
under
the
rules
of
the
communist
party,
person
who
doesn't
his
dues
for
four
months
is
dropped,
automatically
dropped.
and
the
court
felt
that
under
those
circumstances
that
mere
fact
that
he
had
a
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
--
a
card
wasn't
sufficient.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
that's
correct
with
one
caveat
and
that
is,
of
course,
the
term
"burden
of
proof".
it's
--
it's
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes,
it's
a
judicial
term.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
and
--
yes.
i
--
i
think
the
--
the
administrators,
the
--
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
looks
at
the
whole
evidence.
and
if
it
doesn't
find
the
evidence
there,
why,
i
--
i
think
that
it
--
it
wouldn't
be
warranted
in
--
in
affirming
an
administrative
appeal
certainly.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes,
it
--
it
certainly
would.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes,
i
--
i
think
that
the
galvan
case
said
that
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
in
--
in
that
regard
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
--
mr.
justice
harlan,
as
we've
stated
in
our
--
our
brief
in
this
case,
all
of
these
questions
have
been
very
extensively
briefed
and
argued
in
the
harisiades
and
the
galvan
case.
i
think
most
of
them
were
met
in
the
harisiades
case.
and
of
course,
the
--
the
1950
act
just
really
extended
the
--
the
policy
of
the
1940
act
to
the
communist
party
as
such.
and
that
was
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
it
couldn't
be
completely
arbitrary.
of
course
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
--
there
--
there
comes
a
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes,
there
--
there
comes
a
point,
if
--
if
legislation
were
based
on
mere
fantasy
or
pretense,
as
this
court
stated
in
harisiades,
you
would
have
a
different
question.
this
--
the
policy
that
appears
in
section
22
was
based
on
19
years
of
legislative
study.
it
--
it
wasn't
based
on
fantasy
or
pretense.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
that's
the
question,
yes.
we
think
that
was
decided
in
the
account
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
well,
that's
true.
we've
--
this
court
has
--
has
never
--
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
--
that's
--
that's
a
valid
correction
because
this
court
has
never
questioned
the
wisdom
of
congress
in
this
field
which
is
considered
a
--
primarily
a
field
for
political
action
rather
than
action
of
the
more
usual
types.
this
field
--
this
particular
exercise
of
power
is
intertwined
with
the
power
to
maintain
a
republican
form
of
government
and
national
security,
and
it
often
is
--
is
exercised
under
the
war
power.
and
as
i
say
and
as
galvan
points
out
harisiades
unless,
at
least,
the
congressional
policy
is
totally
irrational
based
on
--
on
considerations
which
no
reasonable
man
would
consider
valid.
the
deportation
of
jews
and
catholics,
i
think,
was
pointed
out
in
yesterday's
discussion
as
perhaps
an
example
of
such
a
policy
unless
that
appears
why
this
court
has
usually
differed
to
the
judgment,
the
wisdom
of
congress
in
this
field
no
matter
how
unjust,
harsh
or
--
harsh
it
--
the
--
or
how
much
of
a
hardship
it
produces
on
the
individual
alien
in
its
administration.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
yes.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
no,
it
isn't.
mr.
carl
h.
imlay
thank
you.
