mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court?
as
mr.
rein
has
indicated,
this
case
presents
two
issues,
one
which
is
a
relatively
narrow
issue
of
whether
rowoldt,
the
petitioner's
membership
in
the
communist
party
was
of
the
type
which
the
statute
makes
deportable,
past
membership
in
the
communist
party.
the
second
which
is
a
much
broader
issue
is
the
issue
of
the
validity
of
the
statute.
mr.
rein
has
argued
the
second
question,
the
validity
of
the
statute,
as
if
there
has
been
no
prior
adjudication
of
this
court
either
on
this
particular
issue
or
on
the
general
issue.
as
the
court
knows
the
precise
issue
was
considered
and
decided
three
years
ago
in
a
case
of
galvan
against
press
and
a
very
closely
comparable
issue
was
decided
five
years
ago
in
the
case
of
harisiades
against
shaughnessy.
and
as
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
those
two
cases
indicate
the
opinions
were
rested
upon
a
long
line
of
decisions
of
this
court,
beginning
with
the
chinese
exclusion
cases
in
130
united
states
and
stemming
with
relation
to
deportation
from
the
case
of
fong
yue
ting
in
1893
in
149
u.s.
for
these
reasons
the
government
did
not
see
fit
last
year
or
think
it
appropriate
rather
i
should
say
to
reargue
extensively
the
issue
of
the
validity
of
the
statute,
but
since
the
case
was
set
down
for
re-argument,
we
in
our
supplemental
brief
set
forth
the
argument
which
we
had
made
in
the
harisiades
and
the
galvan
of
briefs
putting
them
together
in
connected
form,
so
that
they
would
be
available
for
the
justices.
i
do
not
propose
in
view
of
the
decision
of
the
court
in
the
galvan
and
harisiades
case
to
re-argue
extensively
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
unless
some
of
the
justices
should
be
desirous
that
i
do
so.
but
i
would
point
out
in
answer
to
statements
that
mr.
rein
made,
that
nowhere
in
our
brief
or
in
our
position,
either
in
harisiades
or
in
galvan,
did
we
take
the
possession
that
there
was
absolutely
no
review
whatsoever.
we
followed
the
view
which
we
think
the
court
adopted
in
those
cases,
that
you
have
to
say
that
the
congressional
determination
was
a
fantasy
or
a
pretense,
before
you
could
invalidate
it.
we
did
not
take
the
position,
which
i
may
say
that
judges
learned
hand,
augustus
hand
and
swan
in
the
second
circuit
decision
in
the
harisiades
case
said
was
well
supported
on
principal
and
authority,
that
is
the
position
that
there
was
an
absolute
authority
of
congress
to
pass
deportation
legislation,
but
this
court
did
not
seek
--
find
it
necessary
to
take
that
position
in
harisiades
or
in
galvan
and
we
have
not
done
so.
now
on
the
first
issue
of
the
membership
of
rowoldt
in
the
communist
party,
i
think
before
i
go
on
to
that
if
the
court
would
pardon
me,
it's
appropriate
to
say
that
there
are
five
cases
pending
on
the
court's
docket
which
raise
the
issue
of
the
validity
of
this
statute,
four
of
them
are
pending
on
petition
for
certiorari
and
one
of
them
is
a
case
in
which
the
writ
has
already
been
granted,
and
that
issue
is
collaterally
involved,
so
that
the
issue
is
before
your
honors
not
only
in
this
case
but
in
other
cases
which
are
on
the
court's
docket.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
the
other
cases,
not
all,
but
some
of
the
other
cases
raise
also
the
question
of
nominal
membership,
but
there
are
five
cases
which
definitively
raise
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute.
and
turning
to
the
question
of
the
membership
of
rowoldt
in
the
communist
party
in
1935,
the
first
thing
perhaps
for
me
to
say
is
that
this
is
an
administrative
procedure
--
proceeding
in
which
there
was
a
hearing
before
an
inquiry
officer
and
appeal
to
the
assistant
commissioner
of
the
immigration
service,
a
decision
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
and
in
those
circumstances
the
court
has
long
ago
laid
down
the
rule
that
it
can
reverse
the
finding
of
fact
only
if
it
finds
that
there
was
no
evidence
or
unless
it
finds
that
there
was
not
some
evidence
to
support
the
finding
of
the
administrators.
justice
brandeis
laid
that
down
particularly
in
a
case
comparable
to
this
and
that
was
a
case
of
a
man
who
distributed
pamphlets
advocating
the
overthrow
of
the
government,
the
case
of
tisi
against
tod
in
264
united
states,
in
which
he
said
the
issue
is
not
whether
the
factual
determination
was
correct
or
whether
it
would
have
been
supported
if
it
had
made
by
a
district
court,
but
only
whether
there
were
some
evidence
to
support
the
finding
of
the
administrators.
and
mr.
justice
douglas
for
the
court
followed
the
same
rule
in
another
case,
a
comparable
case
involving
membership
in
the
communist
party,
bridges
against
wixon
in
1945.
so
it's
in
that
context
we
believe
that
the
facts
in
this
case
have
to
be
appraised.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
that
was
also
true
mr.
justice
in
the
galvan
case,
in
which
the
court
upheld
the
findings
of
deportation.
the
finding
there
was
simply
that
galvan
had
been
a
member,
but
the
court
there
found
that
the
finding
in
that
case
comported
with
the
standards
which
it
said
that
congress
desired
for
membership
and
we
think
the
same
thing
is
true.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
and
i
wish
to
turn
to
the
evidence
in
this
record,
in
the
same
fashion.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
garcia
case?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes
mr.
chief
justice,
but
we
think
the
facts
there
were
very,
very
different.
garcia
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
on
the
record.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
the
record
there,
it
was
very
unclear
as
to
whether
garcia
knew
the
difference
between
the
workers
alliance
and
the
communist
party.
we
think
here
that
is
not
true.
there
was
also
the
fact
that
garcia
was
an
ignorant,
illiterate,
mexican.
rowoldt
is
not
at
all,
rowoldt
is
a
literate
person
with
considerable
degree
of
sophistication.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
they
were
so
different
mr.
chief
justice,
but
in
our
view
there
was
a
very
serious
question
as
to
whether
he
knew
he
was
joining
something
called
the
community
party
at
all.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
know
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
can
find
out.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
there
was
here
too
but
the
witness
refused
to
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
there
was
in
this
case
too,
but
the
witness
refused
to
testify,
there
was
in
this
case
too.
the
reason
why
we
--
the
government
or
the
service
was
forced
to
rely
upon
this
statement
of
january
1947
was
because
that
the
deportation
hearing
which
took
place
in
1952,
the
witness
refused
to
testify
at
all,
and
that
was
the
reason.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right,
no
i
would
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh,
there
is
one
other
bit
of
evidence
which
mr.
rein
i'm
sure
inadvertently
neglected
to
mention,
on
which
the
inquiry
officer
and
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
did
rely,
that
is
that
rowoldt
had
filed
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
an
earlier
immigration
proceeding
in
which
he
said
that
his
membership
in
the
communist
party
terminated
in
1935
and
this
habeas
corpus
petition
which
was
filed
under
his
name
was
introduced
into
evidence
in
the
administrative
proceeding
and
the
immigration
inspector,
the
hearing
officer
relied
both
upon
that
statement
that
he
was
a
member
in
1935
and
on
his
statements
in
the
–
at
the
hearing
in
1947,
which
are
reprinted
in
the
record.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yeah.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
i
just
do
that
to
correct
what
i'm
sure
was
an
inadvertent
statement
in
answer
to
a
question
by
the
chief
justice
that
there
was
no
other
evidence
in
the
record
at
all
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
i
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
there
is
a
statement
there
--
he
was
making
it
on
his
own
and
not
in
response
to
enquiry.
i
was
trying
to
indicate
that
it
isn't
a
question
of
a
man
being
questioned
by
authorities
because
in
a
wholly
separate
immigration
--
a
wholly
separate
court
proceeding
in
which
his
own
lawyer
filed
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
it
is
not
very
great
but
we
think
it
is
sufficient
for
the
immigration
authorities
to
base
their
find
of
deportation.
now
what
did
he
say?
he
knew
the
difference
between
the
communist
party
and
workers'
alliance
because
he
said.
he
said
that
he
left
the
communist
party
in
1935
when
he
was
arrested
for
deportation,
but
he
continued
in
the
workers'
alliance
for
two
more
years
and
he
indicated
that
he
knew
the
difference
about
in
way
you
pay
dues
between
the
workers'
alliance
and
the
communist
party,
but
he
said
there
were
no
books,
dues
books,
for
the
communist
party
but
he
thought
there
were
for
the
workers'
alliance.
he
also
said
that
he
had
been
a
member
of
the,
i
believe
the
executive
board
of
the
workers'
alliance
and
had
a
local
unit
membership
as
far
as
that
was
concerned.
so
we
think
here
as
distinguished
from
the
garcia
case
which
i
mentioned,
there
was
a
clear
distinction
as
to
in
his
mind
between
membership
in
the
communist
party
and
membership
in
the
workers'
alliance.
and
he
knew
that
he
had
joined
the
communist
party,
there
was
also
to
put
to
one
side
no
question
that
was
a
communist
front
organization
of
any
kind,
it
was
the
communist
party,
that
is
the
only
organization
he
was
charged
with
and
the
only
organization
besides
from
the
workers'
alliance
that
he
talked
about.
and
as
i
say
he
left
only
when
he
was
arrested
in
the
deportation
proceedings.
now
he
said
he
paid
dues
to
the
communist
party,
he
said
he
ran
the
communist
party
bookstore
in
minneapolis
for
awhile,
and
then
he
said
he
was
a
kind
of
salesman
there
and
if
they
sold
books
by
strachey,
marx,
and
lenin
socialist
stuff
like
that
he
said.
he
attended
party
meetings
because
–-
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
that's
right
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh
no,
we
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
he
was
employed
by
the
party
as
a
party
official.
we
do
mean
to
suggest
that
he
was
helping
the
party
to
further
the
party's
own
purposes,
that
he
was
from
his
point
of
view
perhaps
idealistically
or
philosophically,
but
that
he
was
aiding
the
party,
which
of
course
wanted
to
disseminate
its
literature
and
he
said
this
was
the
official
bookstore
of
the
communist
party,
so
he
was
aiding
them
in
the
dissemination
of
their
literature.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
i
said
so
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
true
mr.
justice.
but
the
responsibility
of
the
weighing
is
with
the
immigration
official.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
and
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
but
he
didn't
bring
out
any
such
thing.
and
he
was
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
he
was
helping
the
communist
party
in
the
dissemination
of
its
official
literature.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh
that,
there
is
no
doubt
that's
true
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but
many
of
the
activities
of
the
communist
party,
of
persons
of
the
communist
party
can
be
done
by
other
people,
yet
nevertheless
congress
has
declared
that
if
you
do
them
for
the
communist
party,
if
you're
a
member,
and
you're
an
alien,
you
are
deportable.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
we
think
that
the
things
that
he
did
for
the
party
such
as
attending
meetings
or
paying
dues
or
the
last
thing
that
i'd
like
to
mention,
the
petitioning
of
the
various
governmental
bodies,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
that,
that
could
have
been
done
by
representatives
of
other
parties
or
other
organizations.
he
did
them
for
the
communist
party
knowing
it
was
the
communist
party
which
was
a
distinct
and
active
political
organization
in
minneapolis
at
that
time.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
perhaps
this
is
a
good
point
mr.
justice
to
go
into
the
question
of
public
law
14
and
senator
mccarran's
statements
in
relation
to
that.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
do
not
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but
the
court
said
last
year
that
it
was
something
like
almost
48
states,
so
that
i
would
assume
that
it
was
true
in
minneapolis
at
that
time,
but
i
will
try
to
find
out
and
inform
the
court.
but
on
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
good
faith
under
the
statute
is
not
an
excuse.
the
court
has
twice
held,
and
we
think
it's
supported
by
irrefutable
legislative
history,
that
congress
would
pay
no
attention
whatsoever,
i
shouldn't
say
pay
no
attention,
congress
did
not
make
it
a
prerequisite
of
deportation,
that
should
be
conscious
and
aware
of
the
unlawful
objectives
of
the
party.
the
court
so
held
first
in
the
harisiades
case
and
very
explicitly
in
the
galvan
case.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
say
that.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
chief
justice
if
you
accept
this
we
think
you
have
to
because
congress
made
it
the
rule
that
it
is
unnecessary
to
show
any
conscious
awareness
by
the
alien
of
the
unlawful
objectives
of
the
communist
party
and
as
this
court
held
as
i
say
in
these
two
cases,
we
think
that
those
--
those
factors
that
you
mentioned
are
irrelevant
in
determining
whether
he
was
a
nominal
member.
there
are
other
factors
that
might
be
considered
in
determining
whether
he
was
a
nominal
member,
but
we
think
those
factors
as
long
as
he
knew,
it
was
an
active
distinct,
political
organization
which
he
was
joining
and
not,
we'll
say
a
social
front
or
a
community
settlement
operation
or
something
other
like
that,
we
think
those
factors
are
irrelevant.
but
i
do
agree
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
nominal
and
active
membership
and
if
i
may
i'd
like
to
go
into
that
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
only
purposeful
in
the
sense
of
aiding
activities
of
the
party
not
the
unlawful
activities.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
he
knew
that
he
was
going
to
the
court
house
to
try
to
get
more
relief
legislation,
he
knew
that.
we
don't
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yeah
we
think
that
that
is
wholly
irrelevant
and
we
think
that's
preciously
what
the
court
held
in
the
galvan
decision
and
earlier
in
the
harisiades
decision.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yeah
--
no
i
think
those
are
the
same.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
same,
but
we
think
that
in
either
case
there
has
to
be
the
element
of
a
knowledge
or
an
awareness
of
the
unlawful
objectives
of
the
party.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no
there
must
not
--
in
neither
--
under
the
term
purposeful
or
conscious
is
an
element
--
under
neither
of
those
terms
is
an
element
that
he
knew
that
the
party
favored
unlawful
objectives.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
would
be
enough
mr.
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
would
be
enough
to
deport
him,
if
he
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
it
would
be
enough
to
deport
him
that
he
has
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
perhaps
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
public
law
14
which
is
this
act
of
march
28th
1951,
which
is
printed
at
page
3
of
the
government's
brief,
was
a
doctrine
response
to
this
particular
situation.
when
the
act,
when
the
internal
security
act
of
1950
was
passed
and
it
strengthened
and
made
more
rigid
the
deportation
exclusion
requirements
with
respect
the
so
called
subversive
aliens,
the
attorney
general
adopted
the
view
that
an
involuntary
member
of
the
communist
party
was
--
came
within
the
exclusion
provisions
that
is
mostly
the
exclusion
provisions
and
that
meant
not
only
an
involuntary
member
of
the
communist
party
but
of
any
communist
front
organization.
now
in
countries
--
and
he
carried
this
over
to
fascist
organizations,
that
meant
that
in
countries
behind
the
iron
curtain
and
countries
like
germany,
italy
and
spain
if
you
were
a
member,
no
matter
involuntarily
or
by
operation
of
law
or
(inaudible)
if
you
are
a
member
of
some
trade
union
which
in
the
soviet
union
of
course
is
affiliated
with
the
communist
party
or
in
spain
if
you
are
a
member
of
some
organization
which
require
that
you
be
a
member
of
the
fascist
party
by
operation
of
law
or
in
yugoslavia,
or
italy,
or
germany,
that
you
could
not
come
into
this
country.
the
department
of
state
took
the
other
view.
they
said
in
view
of
the
whole
history
of
these
issues
in
this
country
since
1918
or
1920
an
involuntary
member
or
a
member
by
operation
of
law
or
a
membership
while
a
minor
is
not
included
or
under
the
statute,
you
are
not
a
excludable
or
deportable
in
that
situation.
and
this
statute
in
march
1951
public
law
14,
was
passed
primarily
to
remedy
that
situation
to
allow
people
abroad,
who
had
been
a
member
of
the
trade
union
in
germany,
or
in
yugoslavia,
or
in
soviet
union
or
the
ukraine
to
come
into
country
and
not
to
be
barred
and
it
was
in
the
course
of
that
discussion
that
all
of
these
things
which
have
been
read
and
which
are
included
in
both
briefs
were
stated.
now
as
the
court
held
in
the
galvan
case
and
we
agree
the
--
what
congress
was
doing
was
not
something
new,
congress
was
trying
to
put
into
words
what
had
been
the
law
as
it
was
understood
by
court
decisions
and
administrative
decision
prior
to
the
attorney
general's
reversal
of
its
position
in
1950
and
has
declaration
that
that
involuntary
membership
while
you
are
minor
was
covered
by
the
law.
and
they
were
--
the
legislative
history
of
that
statute
is
replete
with
statements
that
they
weren't
trying
to
establish
something
new,
that
they
were
trying
to
go
back
to
the
law
as
they
understood
that
it
had
been
administered
by
the
courts
and
the
administrators
since
1920.
we
also
agree
with
what
the
court
said
in
the
galvan
case
that
the
three
statements,
the
three
elements
which
are
included
in
the
law
that
is
minority,
membership
by
operation
of
law,
membership
to
obtain
the
necessities
like
where
necessary
for
such
purposes
are
not
the
only
elements
which
can
be
considered
that
--
an
element
from
which
senator
mccarran
grew
from
the
colyer
against
skeffington
case
could
also
be
considered.
now
what
was
that
drawn
from
colyer
against
skeffington.
it
was
unconscious
accidental
membership
by
people
who
didn't
know
what
they
were
joining
and
this
is
what
judge
anderson
had
before
him
and
this
is
the
only
portion
of
judge
anderson's
opinion
that
senator
mccarran
was
relying
on.
it's
people
who
were
members
of
the
socialist
party
in
new
england
in
1918,
'19,
whose
--
local
party
units
said
let's
change
the
names
of
the
communist
party
and
was
adopted
by
a
vote
and
they
automatically
went
on
to
the
roads
of
the
new
party.
they
had
no
part
in
this
change.
they
didn't
even
really
know
what
the
communist
party
was.
it
was
that
accidental,
unconscious,
artificial
membership
which
judge
anderson
was
discussing
in
colyer
against
skeffington
and
which
senator
mccarran
was
discussing.
well
you
don't
have
that
here.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
they
thought
it
was
just
a
change
in
the
name
of
the
old
party,
which
they
were
already
members
of.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh!
yes
but
the
socialist
party
was
not
a
party
which
anyone
said
was
an
excludable
or
deportable
party.
and
they
were
--
it
was
as
if
they
were
members
of
the
democratic
or
republican
club
in
some
state
of
the
union
and
somebody
came
along
and
said
let's
change
the
name
to
the
communist
party
and
they
said
okay,
that's
sounds
like
a
good
name
and
it
was
changed.
that's
the
kind
of
situation
which
judge
anderson
had
before
him
and
it
wasn't
a
kind
of
a
situation
you
have
here
where
this
man
joined
the
communist
party
knowing
that
it
was
a
party
and
not
--
he
wasn't
just
carried
over
on
the
rolls
from
a
preceding
party
which
is
the
situation
that
judge
anderson
had
before
him.
i
stress
again
that
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
communist
front
organizations
mr.
chief
justice
(inaudible)
really
into
a
different
category
because
congress
in
the
1950
act
specified
the
communist
party
as
a
membership
in
which
was
a
ground
for
deportation.
it
did
not
necessarily
specify
any
other
organization
by
name
and
it
also
provided
that
if
you
are
a
member
of
communist
front
organization
of
a
certain
type
and
could
show
that
you
didn't
know
the
purposes
of
it
and
resigned
as
soon
as
you
did,
that
that
would
excuse
you
from
deportation.
so
i
think
it's
fair
to
set
to
one
side
the
problem
of
communist
front
organizations
which
we
don't
have
here.
we
have
here
membership
in
the
communist
party
per
se
and
only
that.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
understand
that
mr.
justice.
i
have
these
three
things
to
say.
in
the
first
place
it
must
be
recalled
that
judge
anderson
took
the
view
of
the
statute
in
1918
which
was
rejected
by
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
rejected
by
congress,
that
there
must
be
some
showing
of
personal
knowledge
or
advocacy
and
i
think
that
by
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
(inaudible)
yes,
but
i
think
that
color,
his
use
of
language.
second,
i
do
not
think
that
when
senator
mccarran
was
referring
as
he
did
just
to
this
portion
of
a
long
opinion
by
judge
anderson
and
not
to
any
others,
that
he
meant
then
to
incorporate
sub
silentio
and
as
the
court
held
in
the
galvan
case,
he
did
not
incorporate
at
all,
the
notion
that
the
alien
must
be
aware
of
the
unlawful
purposes
of
the
party.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
there
was
no
proof
at
all
in
the
galvan
case,
i
mean
that
was
no
proof
or
at
least
no
finding
that
galvan
knew
the
purposes
of
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but
there
was
no
proof
that
he
knew
of
the
unlawful
objectives
of
the
party,
there
was
proof
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
party
and
the
court
said
even
assuming
that
he
didn't
know
of
the
membership
of
the
party,
lawful
objectives
of
the
party,
his
membership
was
not
nominal,
even
assuming
as
he
says,
that's
what
the
court
said
there.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
galvan
knew
the
party
was
into
--
he
was
a
trade
union
official.
he
knew
that
the
party
was
interested
in
trade
union
activities.
there
was
some
evidence
that
he
had
some
knowledge
of
party
classics,
what
do
we
have
here?
the
party
at
that
time
was
interested
in
trying
to
obtain
better
relief
measures,
different
kinds
of
legislation.
rowoldt
by
his
own
statement
was
interested
in
that.
he
apparently
went
with
members
of
the
party
to
the
courthouse
and
the
other
people
concerned
with
relief
measures
in
order
to
petition
for
changes
in
those
phases,
now
that
was
a
purpose
of
the
party
at
time
which
he
participated
in.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
maybe
different
mr.
justice,
but
we
think
that
congress
said
that,
that
made
the
determination
to
that
kind
of
person,
if
he
knew
he
was
working
for
a
purpose
of
the
communist
party,
which
this
man
did
i
think
undoubtedly.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
there
isn't
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
just
on
the
basis
of
his
own
statement,
it's
a
fair
inference
which
the
administrative
officials
could
draw
on
the
basis
of
his
activities,
his
working
at
the
bookstore,
plus
his
knowledge,
incorrect
though
it
maybe,
of
party
classic,
that
he
had
a
purposeful
intention
to
aid
party
activities
in
minneapolis
at
that
time.
i
think
that
that's
a
fair
inference.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes
i
do,
and
i
think
that,
that
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
but
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
he
wasn't
a
member
of
the
republican
party
or
the
socialist
party
or
the
farmer-labor
party
or
the
democratic
party,
and
he
was
active
in
that
party
as
a
part
of.
there
is
nothing
else
in
the
record
to
show
that
he
mistook
it
for
some
other
party
or
that
he
wasn't
interested
in
what
the
party
was
doing.
now
the
party
political
activities
at
that
time
took
the
roll,
the
shape,
that
put
many
parties
or
many
organizations
including
the
two
great
major
parties
were
doing,
trying
to
get
relief
in
the
broader
sense
for
the
impoverished
and
depression
stricken
people
in
the
country
and
that's
what
the
communist
party
was
doing
in
that
case.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but
congress
meant
that
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
galvan
carried
out
no
other
objectives
from
the
type
from
this
man
did,
he
worked
in
trade
union
activities.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
but
it
would
also
aid
him.
he
knew
that
if
he
joined
the
trade
union
it
would
--
if
he
joined
the
communist
party
it
would
help
him
in
his
trade
union
rise
and
a
trade
union
hierarchy.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
isn't
the
personal
kind
of
economic
need
which
you
might
have
and
which
was
possibly
present
in
the
garcia
case,
the
other
case
in
which
we
moved
for
a
remand,
where
there
was
some
indication
that
this
impoverished
mexican
thought
was
going
to
shoes
for
his
children
from
the
communist
party.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right,
but
that's
political
activity,
if
you
go
and
talk
to
the
courthouse,
you
talk
to
people
who
are
running
things
as
he
said,
if
you
disseminate
their
literature
--
the
literature
of
the
party
that
falls
within
the
ordinary
concept
of
political
activity.
he
may
have
been
doing
it
only
because
he
thought
that
this
was
something
that
was
a
good
for
all
the
people,
but
congress
has
said
that
doesn't
make
any
difference,
if
you
affiliate
yourself
by
membership
with
the
communist
party
and
undertake
these
activities
for
that
party,
you
are
deportable.
it's
clear
and
it's
clear
that
he
--
at
least
it's
a
fair
inference,
and
i
myself
would
draw
that
inference
on
the
basis
of
this
record,
that
it
wasn't
a
personal
compelling
need
for
himself,
that
is
to
get
shoes
or
food
for
himself,
which
caused
him
to
enter
these
activities,
but
a
general
joining
up
with
a
group,
which
was
trying
to
get
it
for
all
the
people
as
he
called
in
that
region.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
pardon?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh
no.
i
say
that
the
choice
for
rationale
inferences
is
for
the
administrator
and
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
in
tisi
and
tod,
the
alien
denied
that
he
knew,
he
was
an
italian
who
knew
no
english,
that
he
denied
that
he
knew
that
the
pamphlets
which
he
was
distributing
advocated
the
overthrow
of
the
government
and
mr.
justice
brandeis
said
there
was
no
evidence
by
the
government
to
the
contrary,
but
there
was
other
evidence
in
which
a
rationale
inference
could
be
drawn.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
the
standard
was
laid
down
in
the
galvan
case,
and
i
think
stressing
again,
but
i
don't
think
it
was
new
in
the
galvan
case.
i
think
it
was
a
standard
which
had
been
true
of
the
administrator
of
judicial
interpretation
of
comparable
statutes
back
to
1920,
that
is
you
must
find
a
voluntary
membership,
not
under
duress.
you
have
a
find
a
membership
while
you
are
of
age
not
a
minor.
you
have
to
find
a
conscious
membership
that
is
he
knew
that
he
was
joining
the
communist
party
as
distinguished
from
the
workers'
alliance
or
say
or
the
republican
party
or
the
farmer-labor
party
and
it
must
not
be
an
accidental,
artificial
or
unconscious
membership
in
that
party.
when
you
fulfill
those
standards
and
the
decision
on
the
facts
rest
with
the
administrators
we
think
that
the
function
under
the
statute
had
been
performed
properly.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
not
the
unlawful
objectives
of
the
party.
the
objectives
of
the
party
--
the
communist
party
as
history
has
shown
has
a
very
series
of
objectives.
the
ultimate
objective
maybe
the
unlawful
overthrow
of
the
government,
but
there
are
medium
objectives
or
median
objectives
in
which
they
have
--
try
to
obtain
certain
results.
now
we
don't
think
that
under
galvan
there
has
to
be
any
showing
at
all
that
he
wanted
to
obtain
the
ultimate
objective
of
unlawful
overthrow
of
the
government.
we
think
that
it's
sufficient
as
we
think
there
is
showing
in
this
case
if
he
wished
to
obtain
or
to
help
him
obtaining
the
immediate
objectives
of
the
communist
party
at
that
time
and
there
is
sufficient
in
this
record
we
think
to
show
that
he
did
wish
to
obtain
the
immediate
objectives
the
obtaining
of
relief,
changes
in
relief
regulations
new
legislation
and
that
he
was
active
in
that
respect.
it's
also
one
of
the
intermediate
objectives
of
the
communist
party
to
disseminate
their
literature,
that's
true.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
yes
mr.
chief
justice
i
do
on
the
basis
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes
on
the
basis
of
the
legislation,
legislative
history
of
this
particular
statute
in
1950,
its
predecessor
in
1940
and
back
to
the
anarchist
deportation
statute
of
1918
and
1920
which
we
have
set
out
in
our
supplemental
brief
to
the
respondent
on
re-argument,
i'll
come
to
that.
we
think
that
it's
clear
in
our
view
that
congress
did
intend,
that
it
made
a
conscious
deliberate
choice
to
deport
a
man
just
to
the
type
that
you
had
mentioned
if
he
knew
he
were
joining
the
communist
party,
that
a
thought
that
it
might
get
otherwise
worthy
people
in
to
the
net
but
it
thought
it
was
worthwhile
in
order
to
secure
the
deportation
of
those
whom
it
wished
to
get
and
particularly
because
it
thought
of
aliens
as
temporary
guests,
that
word
is
not
the
government's
word,
that's
the
words
of
members
of
a
congress
who
supported
this
legislation.
they
thought
that
all
aliens
as
temporary
guests.
and
they
were
desirous
of
ridding
the
country
of
people
whom
--
these
people
whom
they
consider
undesirable.
and
i
think
they
made
a
conscious
choice
to
get
any
person,
even
the
type
of
person
that
you
mentioned
if
he
deliberately
chose
to
join
the
communist
party
even
though
he
did
not
know
of
the
unlawful
objectives
of
the
party
or
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
that
would
be
different
mr.
justice
because
that
wouldn't
be
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
i
thought
he
said
that
he
knew
that
he
was
joining
a
party,
but
he
thought
the
party
had
these
--
a
political
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
he
would
have
--
yes.
and
we
think
it
sufficient
to
show
that
he
knew
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
he
said
he
is
the
member
of
the
communist
party.
that
that
is
sufficient,
that
is
enough
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
if
i
may
give
you
an
analogy
mr.
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice,
some
statutes
provide
that
membership
of
various
commissions
shall
be
bipartisan
and
the
person
have
to
nominate
a
republican
or
a
democrat.
it
would
be
enough
if
the
president
nominated
a
man
who
said,
i
am
democrat,
that's
all.
i
am
a
member
of
the
democratic
party,
given
that
he
wouldn't
go
beyond
it,
because
he
says
i
am
member
of
the
democratic
party.
if
someone
came
along
and
if
someone
came
along
and
said,
he
isn't
a
member
of
the
democratic
party,
he
never
registered,
he
never
voted,
he
never
contributed
so
forth,
then
an
issue
in
fact
might
be
raised.
but
here
you
have
a
man
who
says
i
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
and
i
knew
the
difference
between
the
workers'
alliance
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
he
said
i
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
recall
that
there
was
any
statement
of
that
type.
he
said
i
was
--
they
asked
him,
“were
you
a
member
of
any
organizations?”
he
said,
“yes,
i
was
a
member
of
local,
certain
local
hotel
and
restaurant
workers
organization”
“and
what
organizations
have
you
belonged
in
the
past,”
“in
the
past
the
workers'
alliance,
the
communist
party.”
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
that
is
sufficient.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
[attempt
to
laughter]
my
present
point
is
that
if
you
have
a
record
where
a
man
says,
i
am
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
and
there
is
nothing
else.
if
there
were
what
mr.
justice
harlan
suggested
then
you
would
have
an
issue
of
fact.
and
it
maybe
that
in
a
case
like
that,
there
wouldn't
be
some
--
any
evidence
to
support
the
view
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
but
you
don't
have
that
case
here.
you
have
no
suggestion
really
we
think
that
this
was
a
charitable
organization
or
the
united
givers
fund
or
a
community
chest
operation
or
something
like
that.
all
the
indications
are
that
he
knew
that
it
was
a
party
which
was
organized
in
his
area
in
minneapolis
and
undertaking
certain
activities.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
he
worked,
he
worked
in
the
bookshop
and
he
said
they
were
these
party
classics
and
that's
also
ground
for
drawing
the
inference
that
he
knew
what
he
was
doing.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
do
not
know,
the
record
does
not
reveal
but
he
said
it
was
the
official
outlet
of
the
communist
party
in
minneapolis,
he
said
that
himself.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
there
is
nothing
in
the
record,
but
i
think
it
is
matter
of
judicial
knowledge
that
communist
party
is
interested.
one
of
its
prime
activities
in
any
area
where
it
works
is
the
dissemination
of
its
literature
in
order
to
recruit
members
and
to
convince
people
of
its
cause
and
that's
a
fair
inference
and
that's
what
he
was
engaged
in
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
some
of
them
are,
but
there
is
no
indication
in
this
record
whether
that
was
done.
just
before
the
recess,
i
would
like
to
stress
that
the,
we
think
there
is
no
need
for
a
remand
in
this
case
because
of
the
fact
that
it's
exactly
the
same
standard
which
galvan
said
should
be
followed
by
the
administrators,
were
followed
before
that
is,
they,
galvan
did
not
set
forth
any
new
standard
which
the
administrators
should
thereafter
conform.
these
were
standards
which
the
administrator,
administrator
had
supposedly
been
following
except
for
the
short
period
of
the
attorney
general
(inaudible)
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
after
galvan
i
do
not
know
but
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
because
on
a
reconsideration
of
the
facts
in
that
case
the
solicitor
general
came
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
a
very
grave
doubt
and
an
injustice
might
be
being
done
in
that
particular
case
because
of
the
fact
that
the
man
was
literate
that
he
was,
as
he
said
starving
that
he
might
really
meant
to
obtain
food
and
shoes
for
his
children
that
he
didn't
know
the
difference
between
a
communist
party
and
a
workers
party.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
minutes
i
have
remaining
i
would
like
to
first
of
all
to
state
categorically
to
the
court,
because
i
believe
that
it
is
supported
by
the
various
elements
of
legislative
history,
which
we
have
set
forth
in
our
supplemental
brief
on
re-argument,
that
congress
desired
in
this
1950
statute
as
it
had
in
the
predecessor
1940
statute
to
deport
all
members
of
the
communist
party
who
were
in,
no
matter
how
long
ago,
their
membership,
no
matter
how
short
a
period
of
their
membership,
no
matter
what
their
knowledge
of
the
unlawful
aims
and
objectives
of
the
communist
party.
it
was
a
sweeping
position
which
congress
took.
one
piece
of
legislative
history
which
we
believe
is
significant,
i'd
like
to
read
to
the
court,
it's
printed
at
pages
14
and
15
of
our
supplemental
brief
on
re-argument,
(inaudible)
of
the
two
government
briefs,
and
it's
the
senate
report
on
the
1940
statute,
which
for
the
first
time
made
past
membership
in
the
communist
party
deportable.
as
the
court
will
recall
in
1939
on
the
case
of
kessler
against
strecker
in
307
united
states,
the
court
held
that
under
the
statute
which
then
existed,
that
is
the
1918
statute,
as
it
has
been
amended,
you
had
to
find
that
the
alien
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
in
order
to
deport
him
and
then
the
court
reversed
the
deportation
order
against
strecker
because
there
was
no
evidence
that
he
was
a
member
and
had
not
been
found,
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
there
was
evidence
the
he'd
been
a
prior
member
of
the
communist
party.
the
court
said
in
that
case
that,
that
wasn't
enough
under
the
statute
as
it
then
read.
mr.
justice
roberts
opinion
for
the
court
says
in
the
absence
of
express
and
explicit
wording
by
congress,
we
are
unwilling
to
assume
that
congress
had
wished
to
deport
aliens
who
had
membership
in
the
communist
party
long
time
past
or
for
shorter
in
the
court's
opinion
and
to
the
decision
in
the
kessler
against
strecker
case,
because
a
year
later
in
1940,
they
amended
the
statute
to
provide
for
deportation
of
past
members
and
we
think
the
quotation
from
the
senate's
report
which
was
repeated
in
the
conference
report
is
significant
because
it
says
in
the
past
membership,
this
is
on
page
15
in
the
parenthesis
at
the
end
of
the
quotation,
"for
no
matter
how
short
a
time
or
how
far
in
the
past,
so
long
as
it
was
after
the
date
of
entry."
this
was
as
justice
jackson
said
in
harisiades
case,
an
extreme
example
of
the
use
of
the
expulsion
power
and
congress
intended
that
it
be
so.
and
so
we
think
that
it
would
be
going
contrary
to
the
intention
of
congress
as
it
has
been
manifested
in
these
statutes
which
have
become
more
and
more
severe
in
relation
to
deportation
of
subversives
over
the
years
beginning
in
1918,
1920,
1940,
1950,
1952,
we
think
it
is
clear
from
this
course
of
legislative
history
that
congress
did
not
wish
to
exclude
a
man
because
he
didn't
know
that
the
communist
party
advocated
unlawful
objectives
or
even
if
he
may
not
have
had
full
and
complete
knowledge
of
that,
but
he
didn't
have
an
inkling
that
they
had
unlawful
objectives.
in
the
cases
which
have
come
before
the
court,
particularly
in
the
harisiades
case,
there
were
records
in
which
at
least
i
think
two
of
the
aliens
involved
in
that
case,
there
were
three
aliens
involved
in
the
harisiades
case
in
1952,
harisiades
himself,
mrs.
coleman
and
mascitti.
as
to
mrs.
coleman,
there
was
no
indication
whatsoever
that
she
had
any
inkling,
you
might
say
of
the
unlawful
or
undesirable
character
of
the
communist
party.
as
to
mascitti
there
was
very
slight
bet
as
to
harisiades
that
was
considerably
more,
but
there
that
court
had
before
it
records
in
which
at
least
as
to
one
of
the
aliens
there
was
less
knowledge
of
the
activities
of
the
communist
party
than
there
is
in
the
case
of
rowoldt
who
was
before
the
court
and
yet
the
statute
was
upheld
as
to
those
individuals.
on
the
basis?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
in
mrs.
coleman's
case
not.
i
think
if
the
court
will
go
back
to
the
briefs
on
the
record
in
the
case
of
mrs.
coleman,
one
of
the
three,
they
will
find
nothing
comparable
to
what
you
mentioned
mr.
justice,
and
we
think
it
too
is
significant,
that
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
cannot
say
off
hand
mr.
justice,
but
i
do
think
that
in
the
case
mrs.
coleman,
there
was
almost
nothing.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
if
it
should
be
held
that
where
there
is
a
mere
assertion
of
membership
and
nothing
more,
the
statute
applies
to
where
the
alien
goes
on
and
gives
his
reasons
for
joining,
it
does
not
--
it
would
be
a
curious
result
i
submit
with
deference
mr.
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
but
always
remembering
as
i've
stressed
so
often
in
this
argument
the
primary
role
of
the
administrators.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
chief
justice
if
the
man
said
i
joined
it
thinking
it
was
an
agency
to
get
food
and
there
was
reason
to
believe
that
he
thought
it
was
a
social
agency
let's
say
and
not
a
party,
yes,
that
would
not
be
an
excludible
states
under
the
statute.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
if
you
join
an
organization
and
pay
dues
and
attend
meetings
and
you
know
it's
a
communist
party,
i
think
that's
what
congress
wanted
to
cover.
if
a
man
joined
an
organization
not
knowing
that
it
was
the
communist
party,
thinking
it
was
the
united
givers
fund
or
some
social
agency,
that's
a
different
matter.
but
if
you
join
the
communist
party
and
even
in
the
days
of
1935
and
since
that
communist
party
was
on
the
ballot
in
so
many
states,
it
would
be,
and
particularly
with
a
literate
man
like
rowoldt,
it
would
he
hard
to
believe
that
he
didn't
know
he
was
joining
a
party,
well
he
may
not
have
been
interested
in
certain
aspects
of
the
party
or
not
care,
but
he
knew
he
was
joining
a
political
party,
as
the
court
said
in
rowoldt,
an
active
and
distinct
political
organization
and
my
submission
is
that
under
the
whole
legislative
history,
that's
enough,
that's
what
congress
intended
to
cover.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
judge
anderson's
opinion
in
the
(inaudible)
case
which
is
quoted
in
part
in
our
original
brief
on
pages
32
and
33,
says
they
passed
from
one
organization
to
another,
supposing
the
change
to
be
a
mere
change
of
name,
the
mere
change
of
name,
that's
the
basis
upon
which
he
rendered
his
decision,
and
i
would
think
in
that
case
and
without
any
other
showing,
that
decision
would
be
correct,
but
we
don't
have
that
here.
we
have
a
man
who
joined
a
new
party,
in
the
garcia
case,
the
case
that
was
remanded.
there
was
doubt
as
to
whether
he
knew
the
difference
between
the
workers
alliance,
but
not
here.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
i
think
that
unless
there
was
some
--
my
suggestion
is
that
unless
there
were
some
outside
proof
that
he
knew
that
the
change
was
more
than
a
mere
change
in
name,
then
he
would
fall
under
the
carter
and
skevington
rule
but
if
he
just
thought
let's
call
it
the
communist
party
as
it
could
be
called
the
farmer
labor
party
or
the
progressive
party
or
some
other
party,
but
if
there
was
some
other
evidence
as
we
think
there
clearly
is
here,
it
would
not
fall
under
that
rule.
before
i
sit
down,
i
would
--
if
i
may
i
would
like
to
make
two
other
suggestions
to
the
court.
the
first
is
that
this
entire
administrative
proceeding,
though
it
occurred
before
the
galvan
decision,
occurred
after
public
law
14,
the
act
of
march
28,
1951,
which
the
galvan
decision
expiated
on
because
that
act
was
passed
on
march
28,
1951
which
happened
to
be
precise
date
on
which
his
deportation
hearing
was
held
before
the
special
inquiry
officer.
so
the
special
inquiry
officer,
and
shortly
thereafter
the
immigration
service
issued
a
new
regulation
under
the
--
as
required
under
that
act,
so
the
special
inquiry
officer,
the
commissioner
of
immigration
and
the
board
of
immigration
appeal,
decided
this
case
entirely
after
the
act
of
march
28,
1951
was
on
the
books.
in
the
same
connection
i
should
that
say
that
rowoldt
petitioned
for
suspension
of
deportation
very
belatedly
in
1955
before
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
and
it
was
denied
for
three
separate
reasons,
but
there
was
no
--
there
was
opportunity
for
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
to
raise
this
issue
of
membership
that
he
didn't
have
sufficient
membership
and
it
was
not
done.
he
had
never
raised
it
administratively
throughout
the
administrative
proceedings
even
though
it
was
--
the
administrative
proceedings
as
i
say
took
place
after
the
act
of
march
28,
1951,
he
didn't
raise
the
issue
that
he
wasn't
the
type
of
member
covered
by
the
statute.
as
far
as
i
can
determine
he
didn't
raise
that
issue
until
he
got
to
this
court
and
certainly
he
didn't
raise
it
in
the
administrative
proceedings.
he
didn't
even
raise
it
before
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
when
he
applied
belatedly
for
suspension
of
deportation
in
1951.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
thank
you.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
i
think
there
were
not
pro-forma.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i'd
like
to
make
clear
to
the
court
that
there
was
a
hearing
which
was
before
a
warrant
of
deportation
had
even
issued
in
january
1947,
and
that's
what
the
court
has
before
it,
it's
printed
a
new
record.
then
later
in
1952
there
had
been
an
early
one
but
it
was
invalidated
for
procedural
defect.
in
1952,
in
1951
i'm
sorry,
they
started
again
a
deportation
proceeding
and
they
tried
to
get
him
to
take
stand
at
that
deportation
proceeding.
the
examiner
who
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
this
was
an
ex-parte
hearing.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i'm
not
able
to
say.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
would
suggest
that
the
special
inquiry
officer
seems
to
me
to
have
been
quite
fair
in
going
through.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
would
also
say
that
an
attempt
was
made
to
go
further
in
the
hearing
in
1951
and
he
did
not
take
the
stand,
so
there
was
no
possibility.
the
only
further
thing
i
would
like
to
say,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
say
it
really
only
because
mr.
rein
in
his
opening
talked
about
mr.
rowoldt's
lack
of
ties
to
his
own
country
germany.
there
is
in
the
record
at
pages
20
to
23,
question
and
answer
statement
by
mr.
rowoldt
as
to
his
attitude
toward
naturalization,
which
i
think
does
not
jive
at
all
with
the
view
which
mr.
rein
gave
here
that
he
had
lost
all
his
ties
with
his
homeland
and
wanted
to
remain
as
a
permanent
citizen.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
he
says
that
repeatedly
that
he
wanted
to
go
back
to
germany
and
always
wanted
to
go
back
to
germany,
whether
this
is
true
or
not
i
don't
know.
mr.
rein
also
said
that
the
petition
for
naturalization
was
denied.
that
maybe
true.
i
gather
the
--
it's
found
in
record
the
departmental
clause
which
i
have
don't
indicate
what
happened
to
it.
the
only
indication
i
have
is
his
statement,
in
this
printed
record
i
did
not
press
my
naturalization
application.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
i
thought
it
best
to
make
it
a
more
thorough
investigation.
