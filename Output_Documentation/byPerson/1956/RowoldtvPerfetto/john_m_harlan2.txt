justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
that
latter
question
you're
asking
is
to
overrule
galvan?
justice
john
m.
harlan
don't
--
don't
you
think
it
gets
quite
a
full
answer
to
mr.
justice
frank
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question.
it
seem
to
me
from
reading
your
excerpts
that
this
man
showed
an
extraordinary
amount
of
knowledge
about
the
communist
party
and
had
philosophies
about
it,
whether
they're
right
or
wrong.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
he
was
merely
--
not
the
position
of
the
janitor
or
the
door
keeper
or
the
--
it
seemed
to
me
it
indicated
that
he
had
more
familiarity
with
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
when
were
the
1935
proceedings
dropped?
you
said
they
were
dropped.
when
were
they
dropped?
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
rein,
how
would
you
define
the
kind
of
membership
that
you
think
would
set
aside
the
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
there's
got
to
be
more
than
card-carrying
member.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
doesn't
have
to
be
officership,
he
doesn't
have
to.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
the
books
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
isn't
the
distributing
the
party
literature
enough,
showing
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
working
in
the
book
shop.
that's
a
pretty
accurate.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
hope
your
not
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
reason
i
raised
this
question
is
that
i
think
--
i
hope
you're
going
to
save
enough
time
to
argue
your
second
proposition
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
that
galvan
should
be
overruled.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
--
i'm
not
quite
sure.
do
you
say
that
congress
could
not
pass
a
statute
deporting
aliens
who
were
then
members
at
the
time,
members
of
the
communist
party?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
not
by
name.
this
isn't
deporting
any
--
any
alien
who
is
found
to
be
a
member
of
the
communist
party
is
deportable.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
put
a
question
to
you
that
in
due
course,
i
hope
you'll
come
to.
this
statute
applies
irrespective
of
the
knowledge
or
intent
of
the
membership
of
the
particular
alien
involved,
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
could
you
apply
this
statute
to
a
past
membership
in
1943
and
1944
and
1945
when
this
country
was
an
ally
of
russia
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
irrespective
of
showing
any
purpose
or
motive
or
intent?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
mean
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
--
where
does
congress
said
that
from
its
inception,
the
communist
party
took
on
that
character?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
see
why
you
say
that.
statute
says,
"join
the
communist
party",
and
--
except
for
the
definition
of
the
--
the
regulation
as
it
relates
to
joining
it
for
food
and
so
forth,
joining,
it
seems
to
me,
means
joining.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you're
--
i
think
you're
--
i
--
i
think
you
failed
to
argue
the
point
that's
really
the
bottom
of
this
case
whether
you
can
justify
this
application
to
the
statute
constitutional.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
--
do
you
agree
with
your
opponent
that
galvan
properly
read
or
requires
that
there
must
be
some
rational
connection
between
the
statute
and
the
purpose
to
export
only
undesirable
aliens?
there
must
be
some
rational
collection.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
isn't
fair
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
it
isn't
fair
to
read
galvan
that
way.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
the
essence
of
the
constitutional
question
is
to
whether
it
is
irrational
or
rational
for
congress
to
say
that
a
man
who
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
as
in
this
case,
in
1935
is
an
undesirable
alien.
that's
the
essence
of
the
question,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
claim
that
galvan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
i
make
my
question
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
now
assuming
we
can
conclude
that
this
record
didn't
come
within
that
subdivision
but
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words
you
read
something
more
with
galvan
and
merely
a
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
reference
to
those
divisions.
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
long
had
this
man
been
a
member?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
he
pay
dues?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
this
a
fair
statement
of
your
position
on
this
branch
of
your
argument
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
that
if
you
didn't
have
galvan
you
would
agree
that
the
record
is
sufficient
(inaudible)
constitutionality
of
the
state
to
warrant
deportation?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no
i
am
saying
if
you
didn't
have
galvan
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
show
a
little
more
than
that.
they
show
that
he
paid
dues.
they
show
that
he
was
a
member
for
a
period
of
at
least
six
months.
they
show
that
he
had
more
than
speaking
acquaintance
with
marxist
classics
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
show
that
he
worked
in
a
book
store
and
now
what
more
do
you
think
that
would
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
before
you
leave
that
(inaudible)
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
supposing
this
case
was
sent
back,
for
a
reconsideration
in
light
of
galvan
which
came
after
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
then
the
immigration
people,
go
over
the
record
again,
they
read
galvan
and
we
now
hold
that
he
is
not
a
nominal
member,
would
that
be
justifiable
or
permissible
holding
in
your
view
on
this
record?
justice
john
m.
harlan
have
there
been
any
reported
decisions
of
the
immigration
people
dealing
with
this
kind
of
a
case,
nominal
membership
after
galvan?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
substantive
due
process?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
it
is
true,
is
it
not
there
was
no
finding
made
as
to
character
of
his
membership,
whether
it
was
nominal
or
otherwise?
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
â€“
supposing
he
produced
five
witnesses
who
testified
that
he
thought
that
this
was
a
charitable
organization
that
he
could
join?
justice
john
m.
harlan
united
givers
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
was
the
chief
justice's
question.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
have
to
show
at
least
that
he
knew
he
was
joining
a
political
party.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
what
is
there
in
the
record
that
shows
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
do
you
define
nominal
membership
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
it
was
shown
or
one
would
conclude
from
reading
this
record
that
he
knew
he
was
joining
a
political
organization
as
distinguished
from
the
united
givers
fund,
a
welfare
organization,
would
that
satisfy
your
view
of
nominal
membership?
