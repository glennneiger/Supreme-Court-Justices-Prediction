chief

you
say
you
--
you
make
no
distinguished
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
or
distinction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
what
i
thought.
he
said
some
place
in
there
that
he
went
to
the
courthouse
and
--
and
that
they
were
able
to
get
right
through
the
courthouse.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
got
--
they
got
some
relief,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
i
suppose
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
suppose
that
would
be
what
he's
looking.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
the
cause
for
this
arrest
in
1935,
the
claim
that
he
was
a
communist.
would
that
be
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
any
indication
how
large
the
store
was
or
what
hours
he
worked
or
anything
like
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
page
are
you
reading
from
--
what
page?
chief
justice
earl

26
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
rather
proceed
in
the
morning
or
do
you
mind
starting
now?
chief
justice

all
right.
chief

we'll

mr.
imlay.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
imlay,
may
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
ask
you
this?
what
is
there
in
any
of
those
statements
of
yours
that
indicates
that
he
was
more
than
a
nominal
member?
what
is
there
in
any
of
those
statements
that
you
rely
upon
as
--
as
showing
or
tending
to
show
that
--
that
he
--
there
had
knowledge
that
this
organization
was
intended
for
--
for
the
overthrow
of
our
government
or
by
his
actions
that
he
intended.
now,
you've
read
all
those
things.
i
just
like
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
have
you
put
your
finger
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
on
anyone
of
them
which
you
feel
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
you
would
rely
on
in
that
regard.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
then
the
finding?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
evidence
to
contradict
that
by
the
witness?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
--
no
testimony
of
any
--
on
the
part
of
any
other
witness
to
--
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
link
them
at
the
period
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
anything
in
his
--
anything
in
his
testimony
or
in
the
record
which
shows
that
he
did
not
join
it
for
purposes
of
obtaining
employment,
food
rations
or
other
essentials
of
living
and
where
necessary
for
such
purposes
as
provided
in
that
regulation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
suppose
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
suppose,
mr.
imlay,
that
he
did
do
this
work
in
the
bookshop
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
for
nothing
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
received
no
compensation
for
it,
not
as
a
regular
employment
because
he
doesn't
say
there
is
regular
employment.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
he
did
it
with
all
powers
in
the
times
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
as
his
testimony
indicates,
what
is
there
in
that
--
in
that
fact
to
controvert
his
statement
that
all
he
knew
--
knew
they
were
trying
to
do
is
to
put
food
in
people's
mouths
and
--
and
give
them
a
place
to
crawl
into,
meaning
--
meaning
there's
a
shelter
or
what
is
rebutted
that
conflicts
with
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
said
that,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
what
did
it
say?
didn't
he
say
at
that
time
that
he
was
doing
it
for
--
for
--
to
get
food
and
to
get
a
place
to
crawl
into?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
those
days
--
in
those
days,
people
were
concerned
more
of
them
with
philosophical
bread
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
as
i
recall.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
for
relief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
for
relief,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
was
that
finding
of
congress?
where
do
we
find
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
does
it
come
from?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
isn't
exactly
a
finding
of
congress,
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
would
be
led
to
this
point
if
the
--
if
the
government
didn't
know
it
until
that
late
date,
is
it
reasonable
to
--
to
hold
just
an
ordinary
person,
a
working
man
like
this
man
responsible
for
knowing
that
sinister
purpose
10
years
or
so
before
the
government
did?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
--
i
thought
though
that
your
--
the
regulation
which
you
put
in
to
your
brief
in
this
note
15
on
--
on
page
38
indicated
that
the
government
itself
didn't
--
didn't
believe
that
mere
--
mere
membership
was
sufficient,
and
they
say
that
--
that
where
--
where
a
person
was
under
16
years
of
age
or
before
he
joined
by
operation
of
law
or
for
purposes
of
obtaining
employment,
food
rations,
or
other
essentials
of
living
and
where
necessary
for
such
purposes.
now,
the
government
didn't
--
didn't
consider
that
it
was
so
--
so
illegal
that
--
that
any
membership
was
--
was
sufficient
for
deportation
because
your
own
--
your
own
administrative
agency
made
that
--
made
that
regulation
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
those
things
that
--
those
joining
that
would
indicate
that
he
didn't
have
knowledge
of
--
knowledge
of
that
sinister
purpose,
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
get
away
from
the
involuntary
joining
and
--
and
let's
take
this
number
iii
for
purposes
of
obtaining
employment,
food
rations,
or
other
essentials.
now,
if
--
if
the
man
in
good
faith
joined
the
communist
party
because
he
--
that
in
those
days,
in
1945
or
1935
--
1935
i
mean,
in
--
in
the
middle
of
the
great
depression,
believing
that
their
great
interest
was
in
securing
food
and
--
and
a
place
for
people
to
live,
do
you
think
it
would
conflict
with
this
--
with
this
regulation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
didn't
this
man
say
that
was
the
--
the
reason
that
he
joined
and
--
and
you
have
no
other
--
other
testimony
in
the
record
except
his
own,
isn't
that
correct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
why
wouldn't
he
come
--
come
under
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
when
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
say
activity
here,
with
the
workers'
alliance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
wasn't
that
the
--
wasn't
that
the
--
at
least
the
full
ostensible
purpose
of
the
workers'
alliance
to
get
relief
for
people
who
were
out
of
employment
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
who
are
suffering?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they
were
very
active.
they
were
very
active
in
that,
would
they
not,
before
all
the
boards
of
supervisors
and
--
and
other
agencies
that
have
the
dispensation
of
relief
during
those
--
during
those
years?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
then
to
indicate
that
he
did
not
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
he
didn't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
he
said
he
was
--
he
was
trying
to
get
relief
from
most
of
people,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
would
--
would
you
read
him
out
of
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
he
did.
i
thought
he
said
he
went
into
it
just
for
these
purposes
to
get
--
to
get
food
and
a
place
to
crawl
in
for
most
of
the
people
and
that
--
that
none
of
the
people
that
he
came
in
contact
with
ever
advocated
overthrowing
anything.
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
he
say
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
didn't
he
limit
--
didn't
he
intent
by
his
--
his
testimony
which
is
all
you
go
on
in
this
case
to
--
to
limit
the
purpose
of
his
--
of
his
joining
the
organization
and
his
activity
while
in
it
to
--
to
getting
food
and
a
place
to
crawl
in
from
majority
of
the
people?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
imlay,
the
--
the
government
introduced
no
evidence
in
this
case,
did
it?
it
just
took
his
statement
and
then
deported
him
on
his
statement,
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
then
also,
it's
not
a
political
activity.
it
would
--
wouldn't
that
bring
him
within
this
number
iii
where
he
joined
it
for
purposes
of
obtaining
employment,
food
rations
or
other
census
of
living
and
where
necessary
for
such
purposes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
he
was
applying
for
the
relief
and
he
thought
that
workers'
alliance
was
a
means
by
which
he
could
better
get
it,
wouldn't
that
--
wouldn't
that
--
in
the
absence
of
anything
to
the
contrary,
wouldn't
that
fit
him
in
to
that
number
iii?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he
--
he
explained
that
by
saying
that
he
thought
that
these
people
could
be
helpful
in
getting
it
for
most
of
the
people
that's
why
he
joined.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
and
there's
nothing
to
counteract,
is
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
think
your
time
is
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you,
mr.
imlay.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rein.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.

mr.
rein.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
wondering
if
this
was
a
fair
inference,
he
was
accused
of
belonging
to
both
the
workers
alliance
and
the
communist
party,
wasn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
am
wondering
if
--
if
he
could
have
been
referring
to
both
of
those?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
before
you
get
to
that,
is
there
any
substantial
evidence
in
the
record
concerning
his
membership
other
than
his
own
statement?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
ballot
in
minnesota
at
that
time,
do
you
know?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
for
what
reason
did
the
government
suggest
the
remand
in
that
case
of
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
mr.
rein
was
just
taking
about,
in
the
light
of
galvan,
wasn't
that
to
take
another
look
at
the
administrative
finding
to
see
if
it
complied
with
the
galvan?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
was
there
no
evidence
at
all
there,
you
concede
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
that
case,
that
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
administrative
board
could
have
acted
on.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
isn't
that
merely
a
matter
of
degree?
now
a
moment
ago
you
said
that
we
would
not
touch
it,
unless
there
was
absolutely
no
evidence
before
the
administrative
agency
and
now
you
say
that
you
did
suggest
and
you
go
back
to
the
administrative
agency
in
the
other
case
because
the
facts
were
different
from
this,
that
he
was
not
this
well
schooled
in
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
would
you
go
as
far
as
to
support
the
view
you
just
said
a
moment
ago
that
in
order
for
us
to
touch
it,
that
there
must
be
no
evidence
before
the
–
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
you
tell
me
what
happened
when
that
case
went
back?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
find
out
for
us
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
--
what
is
the
difference
between
what
he
said
in
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
and
what
he
said
here
in
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
is
no
difference,
is
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
also
said
that
although
he
was
unemployed
and
out
of
funds
that
what
he
did
at
that
bookstore
he
did
without
any
compensation
whatsoever.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
wouldn't
indicate
the
very
permanent,
very
lucrative
employment
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
any
of
those
books
that
he
mentions
that
have
been
found
in
any
library
in
this
country,
couldn't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
this
man
also
say
that
he
didn't
know
there
was
anything
illegal
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
wrong
with
the
party
and
do
you
know
whether
the
communist
party
was
the
legal
party
in
the
minnesota
and
was
on
the
ballot
at
that
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
you
find
out
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
far
as
the
showing
the
man's
conscience
membership
in
an
organization
that
advocated
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence
there
might
be
some
evidence
of
his
good
faith
might
it
not
if
the
--it's
a
regular
party,
if
it's
on
the
ballot,
recognized
by
a
state,
particularly
when
he
is
a
foreigner
in
this
country
and
is
asked
to
join
a
political
party.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
you
do
say
that
it
makes
absolutely
no
difference
whether
this
man
was
a
nominal
member
or
whether
he
was
an
active
member
in
the
party.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
can
be
no
difference.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right,
then
let
me
ask
you
this?
could
it
not
bear
and
does
it
not
bear
in
the
absence
of
other
testimony
on
whether
he
was
an
active
member
or
merely
a
nominal
member
of
the
party
when
he
said
we
didn't
give
any
thoughts
to
those
things
in
those
days,
we
were
thinking
of
bread
then
we
were
thinking
of
a
place
to
--
for
shelter
and
that
we
joined
that,
we
joined
those
parties
in
the
belief
that
that
those
people
would
bring
it
about.
doesn't
that
have
something
to
do
in
determining
whether
he
was
merely
a
nominal
member
or
a
whether
he
joined
it
as
a,
for
the
purpose
of
advocating
their
political
policies.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
say
that
his
membership
must
be
purposeful?
chief
justice
earl
warren
regardless
of
whether
he
knew
if
they
were
or
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
says
that
he
didn't
know
that
they
advocated
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence
and
he
first
did
not
agree
with
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
think
this
--
may
i
ask
just
this
one
more
question,
do
you
think
there
is
any
difference
in
meaning
between
purposeful
membership
and
conscious
membership?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
the
same?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say
there
must
be
a
knowledge?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
knew
--
they
knew
in
that
case
that
it
was
a
political
party,
didn't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
that
was
a
political
party?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
the
present
time
insofar
as
some
of
the
communist
front
organizations
are
concerned,
perhaps
a
man
joined
at
the
time
when
it
really
wasn't
communist
front
organization
but
it
grew
into
one.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
he
remained,
he
remained
a
member
of
it,
is
he
deportable?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
do
you
say
that
you
could
make
a
rationale
finding
that
this
man
had
no
knowledge
of
the
objectives
of
the
party
and
that
on
the
other
hand
you
could
have
a
finding
which
would
be
rationale
to
the
effect
that
he
did
have
such
a
knowledge
and
that,
that
was
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
administrative
officer.
he
therefore
under
your
theory
would
have
a
discretion
to
exercise
in
the
premises,
but
is
there
not
some
standard
under
this
statute
that
he
must
conform
to
if
he
is
going
to
deport
these
people?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
what
is
the
standard
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
do
you
not
think
that
under
galvan
it
was
least
intended
to
convey
the
impression
that
he
must
be
an
active
member,
a
man
who
knew
what
he
was
joining
and
was
taking
steps
to
carry
out
the
objectives
of
the
party?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
may
i
ask
you
this
question,
assume,
assuming
that
in
this
case
this
man
joined
the
communist
party
believing
that
its
only
interest
was
to,
in
the
manner
in
which
he
said,
going
to
the
court
house
and
influencing
the
legislature
to
give
bread
to
the
hungry
people
of
this
country,
that's
all
he
knew
about
the
party,
that's
all
he
did
was
to
join
and
show
an
interest
in
that
phase
as
they
were,
do
you
believe
that
congress
intended
such
a
man
to
be
deported?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that's
what
you
are
confronting
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
that's
a
different
question
whether
he
is
a
member
--
as
i
understood
it,
the
justice
asked
what
is
there
to
show
in
there
that
he
consciously
joined
a
party
for
political
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
why
then,
why
then
galvan
made
no
change
would
you
ask
to
remand
that
other
case,
garcia
case
in
the
light
of
the
galvan?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
might
there
not
be
a
difference
to
of
course,
they
said
i
joined
the
party
and
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
on
one
hand
and
on
the
other
hand,
the
man
said
yes
i
joined
it
because
i
thought
it
was
an
agency
to
get
food
to
the
people
and
that's
the
only
thing
i
knew
about
it
and
the
government
did
nothing
to
counteract
that.
now
if
that
was
controverted,
that
would
be
an
entirely
different
thing,
but
without
being
controverted,
might
that
not
be
stronger
than
the
case
or
the
person
who
said,
i
just
joined
the
party.
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
you
say
the
same
thing
about
(inaudible)
because
in
1918
and
1919,
that
when
they
had
to
dig
up
people
in
the
socialist
party
and
the
communists
broke
off,
and
then
those
who
--
there
were
two
groups
as
i
recall
it,
one
stayed
in
the
communist
party
and
one
group
went
to
the
communist
party,
now
how
do
you
differentiate,
people
who
went
into
the
communist
party
from
the
socialist
party,
than
from
a
fellow
who
went
into
the
communist
party
from
the
workers
alliance
because
he
thought
they
were
both
trying
to
get
food.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way,
now
suppose
he
belonged
to
the
workers
alliance
and
they
had
said
at
some
meeting
of
the
workers
alliance,
well
now
we
will
just
call
this
the
communist
party,
and
the
law
belonged
to
the
communist
party
and
mr.
rowoldt
remained
in,
would
you
think
he
came
under
the
act
or
would
he
be
out?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
make
take
two
or
three
minutes
more.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
didn't
happen
to
find
out
during
the
lunch
hour
what
happened
to
garcia?
