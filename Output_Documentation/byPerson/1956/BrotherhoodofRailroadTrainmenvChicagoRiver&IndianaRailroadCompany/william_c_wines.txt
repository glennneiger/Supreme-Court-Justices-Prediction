mr.
william
c.
wines
may
it
--
may
it
please
the
court.
your
honors,
in
light
of
my
past
and
current
collateral
relation
to
the
court,
i
think
before
beginning
the
statement
of
this
case
i
ought
to
say
that
although
i'm
still
a
regular
assistant
attorney
general
in
charge
of
certain
appellate
work
for
the
state
of
illinois,
the
attorney
general
of
illinois
has
no
interest
in
this
case.
i
appear
as
privately
retained
in
the
course
of
general
practice
by
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen,
and
my
appearance
here
doesn't
imply
any
approval
by
the
attorney
general
of
illinois.
this
case,
if
your
honors
please,
and
the
companion
case
which
has
become
mooted
by
settlement
and
will
not
be
argued
how
presented
to
this
court
as
they
presented
in
the
courts
below.
first,
the
question
whether
the
national
railway
--
whether
the
railway
labor
act
of
1934
prohibits
or
makes
unlawful
strikes
in
the
interstate
commerce
of
the
railroad
business
are
affecting
that
commerce
when
such
strikes
are
over
minor
or
past
or
accumulated
frequencies.
the
petitioner,
brotherhood,
says
that
the
act
does
not
have
that
effect.
the
carriers
say
that
it
does.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
in
this
case
held
that
the
railway
labor
act
of
1934
does
interdict
strikes
over
minor
or
past
grievances.
five
days
later,
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
central
of
georgia
case
made
a
declaration.
it
is
diametrically
contrary
in
its
rationale,
in
its
principle,
and
in
its
logic,
although,
there
are
effectual
distinctions
between
the
two
cases.
a
second
and
the
only
other
question
presented
by
the
case
at
bar
--
i
beg
your
honors'
pardon
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
the
central
of
georgia
case
did
not
reach
the
question
that
i
have
just
stated,
but
turned
solely
upon
its
answer
to
the
second
question
that
i
am
now
going
state.
the
second
question
is
whether
assuming
that
the
national
railway
labor
act
does
make
strikes
unlawful,
even
so,
that
even
indulging
that
assumption
does
it
so
far
repeal
by
implication.
the
norris-laguardia
act
of
1932,
as
probably
two
years
before
the
--
the
railway
labor
act
of
1934,
has
to
reinvest
federal
courts
with
the
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
strikes
over
past
grievances
or
minor
accumulated
individual
grievances
even
though
such
strikes
are
not
attended
by
any
violence
or
anything
of
that
sort.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
your
honor.
there
is
before
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
you
--
i'm
speaking
now
only
with
--
of
strikes
over
minor
grievances,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
there
is
--
you
asked
me
for
decisions
on
the
point,
either
way
there
is
pending
before
this
court
a
petition
for
certiorari
which
so
far
as
i
know
has
not
been
granted.
now,
i
did
not
have
the
time
to
check
this
one
because
i
was
--
i
had
to
check
something
else.
so
far
as
i
know
certiorari
has
not
been
granted,
but
it's
here
before
this
court
in
number
702,
manion
against
the
kansas
city
terminal
railway
company
in
which
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
indicated
that
the
national
railway
labor
act
prohibits
this
type
of
strike
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
but
that
--
that
would
not
be
the
norris-laguardia
act
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
right.
now,
there
is
this
background,
your
honors.
as
your
honors
know
until
1932
there
was
great
debate
in
the
arenas
of
politics,
practical
and
ideal,
economics,
social
philosophy
and
theory
as
to
what
the
--
what
rights
labor
ought
to
have
to
strike.
and
assuming
that
labor
was
exercising
a
right
which
might
be
challenged,
how
far
should
the
drastic
remedy
of
injunction
as
distinct
from
some
other
form
of
sanction
be
applied
to
deter
or
prevent
peaceful
strikes
in
the
field
of
labor
in
general,
not
confined
of
course
to
the
field
about
the
railroad.
the
norris-laguardia
act
was
passed
after
deliberations
that
really
goes
back,
not
necessarily
as
to
the
draft
of
that
act
but
as
to
the
policy
enacted
as
far
back
in
a
labor
relations
issue
want
to
go.
now,
there
isn't
a
--
now,
there
isn't
any
doubt
that
in
1934
congress
was
actually
by
a
real
desire
to
minimize
strikes
in
the
railroad
industry.
before
1934,
the
only
means
of
settling
disputes
of
any
kind
between
railroad
employees
and
te
carriers
have
shorter
strikes
and
possibly
some
kind
of
action
for
a
breach
of
contract
would
be
arbitration
by
system
boards.
nobody
could
be
compelled
to
submit
his
grievances
to
those
boards,
and
when
the
system
boards
acted,
they
acted
as
courts
of
--
as
boards
of
arbitration.
now,
in
1934,
congress
passed
the
national
--
the
labor
railway
--
the
railway
labor
act
with
the
purpose,
we
not
only
admit
but
insist
and
emphasize
of
diminishing,
minimizing,
reducing
the
likelihood
of
railroad
strikes
and
the
number
of
such
strikes.
and
as
counsel
for
the
respondent
quite
correctly
pointed
out,
and
that
everyone
converse
withdrawal
with
the
subject
knows
the
national
railway
labor
act
does
distinguish
between
two
different
categories
of
claims,
grievances,
and
hence
of
threatened
potential
or
possible
strikes.
the
inter
--
counsel
for
the
respondent
have
done,
i
think,
an
excellent
job
in
respondent's
brief
in
pointing
out
that
strikes
over
major
grievances
or
claims
over
major
grievances
are
settled
in
one
way.
they
are
settled
by
a
mechanism
of
mediation
and
conciliation,
if
necessary
by
executive
presidential
intervention,
and
finally
if
all
negotiations
fail
the
brotherhood
calls
a
strike.
now,
there
is
a
different
type
of
claim
and
that
type
of
claim
arises
over
past
grievances.
in
the
instant
case,
the
case
that
i
am
arguing,
some
19
individual
claims
for
compensation,
promotion,
in
one
case
reinstatement,
had
accumulated.
the
employing
railroad
is
the
chicago
river
and
indiana
railroad
company,
attempts
to
negotiate
to
settle
these
claims
on
the
premises
of
the
company
had
failed
and
the
petitioner,
brotherhood,
its
officers
and
members
announced
an
intended
strike
to
continue
unless
demands
for
settlement
of
these
individual
claims
were
met.
thereupon,
the
railroad
filed
these
claims
with
the
adjustment
board.
petitioners
and
the
claimants,
individual
claimants,
have
not
submitted
their
claims
to
that
boar.
and
before
the
time
set
for
the
strike,
the
respondent,
railroad
company,
obtained
from
the
district
court
of
illinois
--
filed
a
suit
for
injunction.
the
district
court
of
illinois
held,
as
we
contend,
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
later
held
in
the
central
of
georgia
case,
that
the
railway
labor
act
does
not
repeal
pro
tanto
the
norris-laguardia
act.
denied
a
permanent
injunction
but,
although,
disclaiming
jurisdiction
did
enter
a
--
an
injunction
restraining
the
strike
to
be
effective
while
the
case
went
to
the
court
of
appeals,
sort
of
a
supersedeas
injunction.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit,
rejecting
petitioner's
contentions
to
the
contrary,
held
first
that
the
railway
labor
act
does
interdict
strikes
over
minor
grievances.
and
second,
that
it
implements
that
interdiction
by
reinvesting
united
states
district
courts
with
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
strikes.
as
i
have
said,
five
days
later
in
the
central
of
georgia
case,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
reached
a
quite
contrary
conclusion
and
declared
that
the
act,
the
railway
labor
act,
does
not
inhibit
strikes
--
does
not
repeal
the
norris-laguardia
act
so
as
to
reinvest
the
federal
courts
with
jurisdiction
over
--
to
grant
injunctions.
now,
there
is
a
great
deal
of
discussion
in
the
briefs
of
petitioners
and
respondent
in
the
instant
case,
which
in
retrospect
of
reading
our
original
brief
which
i
largely
wrote.
i
now
proceed
to
turn
very
much
on
the
new
answers
and
relative
import
of
the
word
"compulsory."
throughout
the
legislative
history,
marshaled
by
both
of
the
briefs,
you'll
find
much
discussion
as
to
whether
or
not
submission
to
the
adjustment
board
was
to
be
"compulsory"
or
"mandatory”
or
whether
it
was
to
be
optional.
now,
the
truth
of
it
is,
if
your
honors
please,
that
whether
or
not
strikes
were
to
be
enjoined
isn't
--
was
not
at
the
time
that
the
railway
labor
act
of
1934
was
before
congress
was
not
a
peripheral
question
at
all.
it
was
in
the
faults
and
not
in
the
penumbra
of
the
spotlight
of
legislative
attention
that
was
turned
upon
the
question.
this
is
not
like
the
many
cases
where
congress
has
clearly
intended
to
regulate
a
certain
area
of
interstate
commerce.
and
some
months
or
years
later
you
get
a
particular
question
as
to
whether
or
not
a
particular
activity
is
or
is
not
in
interstate
commerce,
or
whether
or
not
a
particular
type
of
activity
does
or
does
not,
if
an
interstate
commerce
constitute
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act
or
some
other
act,
even
the
dyer
act
which
your
honors
passed
yesterday.
as
those
questions
arise,
and
we
all
know
that
while
we
speak
and
speak
intelligently
and
seriously
and
correctly
about
elucidating
the
intention
of
congress,
what
we
mean
is,
is
this
really
within
the
policy
that
congress
intend
to
do
an
act
when
we're
quite
sure
that
congress
didn't
have
in
mind
the
specific
set
of
facts
in
a
particular
case
that
comes
to
this
court
for
elucidation
or
expounding
of
a
statute.
this
was
not
such
a
problem.
the
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
please,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
your
honor.
you
will
not.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that,
your
honor,
is
not
--
is
not
--
would
not
state
my
position.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
i
will.
the
position
on
which
we
relying
is
that
congress
was
aware
of
this,
was
actually
aware,
and
in
the
discussions
its
awareness
is
explicit
that
the
question
before
it
was,
“shall
we
reinvest
federal
courts?”
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
understood
that
to
be
what
your
honor
was
asking.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
to
answer
that
question,
we
say
no.
mr.
william
c.
wines
as
to
answer
the
question
that
i
understood
your
honor
to
ask.
mr.
william
c.
wines
the
statute
does
not
--
does
not
say
whether
or
not
strikes
are
permitted
or
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
no.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no.
mr.
william
c.
wines
if
--
if
i
--
if
i
may
respond
more
fully
and
at
least
i
hope
more
clearly
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question,
asked
immediately
before
the
recess.
as
i
understood
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
he
inquired
whether
i,
having
stated
that
the
bill
is
not
explicit
in
either
prohibition
or
permission
of
strikes
and
there
being
no
over-deterrence
by
any
of
the
committees
in
formal
report.
we
were
therefore
remitted
to,
i
believe,
his
honors'
phrase
was
"considerations
of
general
policy."
i
was
forced
to
answer
that
question
monosyllabically,
and
i
said
by
the
--
the
shortness
of
time,
and
i
said
no.
actually,
what
we
do
rely
on
is
these
considerations
which
might
be
said
to
be
of
general
and
of
--
of
policy,
that
here,
there
was
discussion
to
which
i
shall
come
in
just
a
moment.
it
is
the
very
heart
and
core
of
our
argument,
not
on
the
margin
of
the
problem.
the
question
as
to
how
far
if
at
all
the
norris-laguardia
act
should
be
repealed
only
some
two
years
after
its
enactment
and
it
wasn't
lightly
enacted,
was
central.
it
was
focal.
it
was
the
chief
concern
of
the
act.
now,
this
--
yet
we
find
that
congress,
although,
it
was
keenly
aware
of
the
problem,
though
it
was
extensively
and
intensively
discussed
and
argued
with
major
deliberation
for
a
board
any
explicit
prohibition
or
permission
of
strikes
from
which
we
draw
the
conclusion.
and
this
is
our
principal
argument
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
prohibit
cryptically
or
surreptitiously
strikes
when
--
or
if
to
prohibit
them
at
least
to
implement
the
prohibition
by
injunction
when
that
was
the
problem
that
was
being
discussed.
now,
in
the
congressional
hearings,
and
i
am
reading
from
--
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice,
a
few
lines
because
they
are
right
into
the
case.
i'm
reading
from
page
4
of
our
reply
brief.
mr.
--
congressman
wolverton
is
discussing
a
prohibition
about
strikes.
he
said
the
commissioner
eastman
--
now,
commissioner
eastman
was
the
draftsman,
very
largely
the
draftsman
and
the
architect
of
this
very
important
measure.
and
congressman
wolverton
asked
the
architect
of
this
bill,
speaking
of
a
prohibition
against
strikes.
now,
the
only
question
i
am
in
doubt
about
is
whether
there
are
--
or
not
there
should
be
an
injunction
under
this
act
to
prevent
a
strike.
now,
i
am
not
clear
about
that,
commissioner
eastman
said
that
then
mr.
wolverton,
congressman
wolverton
says,
“do
you
think
there
should
be
such
a
provision
in
the
bill?”
and
this
is
what
the
draftsman
of
the
act
told
the
congress
whom
he
was
hoping
would
enact
it.
i
would
rather
see
it
that's
a
prohibition
against
strikes.
i
would
rather
see
it
carried
out
without
that
because
i
do
not
believe
we
were
going
to
have
that
question
here.
further,
in
the
interest
of
time,
i'm
omitting
some
material
on
which
we
do
rely
that's
set
out
in
this
brief.
congressman
wolverton
says,
“let
us
first
have
a
frank
understanding
as
to
whether
it,
that's
a
prohibition
against
strikes,
is
included
or
is
not
included
in
the
bill
and
then
we
can
determine
the
policy
as
to
whether
it
should
be
or
should
not
be
in
the
bill.
but
it
certainly
seems
to
me,
says
congressman
wolverton,
that
the
bill
ought
not
to
be
left
indefinite
either
from
the
standpoint
of
the
carriers
or
the
standpoint
of
the
employees.we
should
know
just
what
the
situation
is”.
so
here,
you
have
congress
considering
a
major,
which
has
not
for
an
incidental
objective
or
subsidiary
desideratum
but
a
primary
objective,
the
minimization
of
strikes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
right,
your
honor.
that's
exactly
what
we're
relying
on.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
think
it
was
not
satisfying.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
don't
see
how
it
could
have
been.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
i
don't
think
so.
and
my
--
my
reasons
are
these,
if
your
honor
please.
we're
confronted
with
question
as
to
whether
there's
a
pro
tanto
repeal
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
if
the
question
arose
peripherally,
if
it
arose
--
if
it
weren't
central,
i
would
not
rely
--
bring
much
talk
on
such
statements
of
congressman
wolverton's
as
this.
but
when
that
was
a
focal
question
and
congress
remains
silent,
then
i
say
the
implication
is
clear
that
they
did
not
intend
a
repeal.
if
i
can
give
a
very
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
don't
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
don't
recall
that
he
did.
mr.
william
c.
wines
exactly
this,
if
i
may,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
give
a
--
a
homely
illustration
to
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make.
suppose
a
client
is
talking
to
a
lawyer
and
a
will
is
drawn,
and
you're
allowed
for
some
reason
or
rather
to
use
their
conversation
to
supplement
the
will.
and
client
asks
the
lawyer
or
the
lawyer
--
does
this
will
disinherit
my
children?
and
the
lawyer
says,
“well
now,
i
don't
know
about
that.”
and
the
client
signs
anything,
rather
preposterous
illustration
i
admit,
since
positive
intention
to
disinherit
is
required
if
not
being
sufficient
that
the
testator
doesn't
simply
intend
to
go
out
of
his
way
to
remember
them.
i
say
that
no
matter
how
ambiguous
the
will
is
if
you
will
permit
it
to
supplement
it
by
that
kind
of
conversation,
under
the
parole
evidence
rule,
it
would
then
become
immediately
clear
that
he
didn't
intend
to
disinherit
the
children.
mr.
william
c.
wines
but
--
but
this
kind
of
colloquy,
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
well
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
if
i
may
with
--
if
i
may
answer
your
question
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
is
just
a
matter
of
what
is
the
most
harmonious
way
of
reconciling
the
two
statutes.
that
argument
is
made
by
the
respondents,
and
the
point
that
i
am
emphasizing
is
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
that
is
true,
but
i
think
these
outside
materials
are
--
are
most
helpful.
mr.
william
c.
wines
now,
commissioner
eastman
is
asked
as
to
whether
there
ought
to
be
a
strike.
i'm
now
reading
from
page
15
of
our
original
brief,
and
he
says,
“my
own
idea
would
be
let
that
question
arise
out
of
experience
and
find
out
whether
there
is
any
--
if
whether
there
is
actual
need
for
any
such
power
before
you
provide
for
issuing
injunctions
for
preventing
strikes."
now
there,
we
have
the
author
of
the
bill
telling
congress
that
in
his
opinion
there
has
not
as
yet
been
evinced
any
actual
need
for
such
a
prohibition
though
he
does
reserve
judgment
on
the
matter
to
be
enlightened
by
experience.
now,
this
case,
i
submit
to
your
honors,
is
not
like
the
dyer
act
case
that
your
honors
decided
yesterday
afternoon
where
everybody
knew,
though
your
honors
divide,
that
the
central
objective
of
the
law
was
to
prevent
stealing
of
automobiles
when
they
were
transported
in
interstate
commerce
and
nobody
paid
any
explicit
to
it
--
attention
to
just
how
far
the
--
the
ambit
of
the
word
stealing
went.
so
you
get
borderline
cases,
embezzlements,
frauds,
and
so
on
which
were
not
focused.
but
here,
the
whole
question
of
how
far
labor
should
go
in
relinquishing
the
right
to
strike
or
should
be
compelled
to
go
in
relinquishing
the
right
to
strike
were
central,
and
we
find
no
express
prohibition,
and
even
if
we
should
concede
that
there
was
not
an
explicitly
formulated
intention
to
continue
an
act,
you
have
to
have
express
--
you
have
to
have
active
intention,
express
or
implied,
active
intention
to
repeal.
many
statutes
are
--
aren't
repealed
just
because
nobody
ever
gets
to
--
gets
around
to
repealing
them
and
sometimes
nobody
even
knows
they
there
until
they
come
to
light.
this
isn't
that
kind
of
a
problem.
now,
another
consideration
that
is
of
importance
is
that
in
1950,
senate
bill
--
senate
bill,
of
that
year,
number
340
--
3463,
known
as
the
donnell
bill,
was
introduced
and
largely
supported
by
the
carriers,
and
that
bill
had
it
been
passed
would
have
prohibited
strikes.
the
carriers
then
took
the
position
that
strikes
ought
to
be
prohibited
but
were
not
effectively
prohibited
by
the
railway
labor
act
of
1934.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
i
realize
that
retrospective
legislative
history
is
--
is
not
as
--
as
compelling
or
conclusive
as
concurrent
or
our
--
our
prayer
legislation.
but
still
when
there
is
a
feeling
in
congress
that
something
isn't
prohibited
and
the
bill
is
introduced
to
prohibit
it
and
fails
the
passage,
i
think
the
matter
is
one
of
some
coaches
though
it
is
not
conclusive.
now,
counsel
for
respondent
quote
much
legislative
history
and
quoted
correctly,
and
i
think
in
pretty
--
in
--
in
fair
context
in
which
many
statements
are
made
by
many
people
who
talked
about
this
bill,
including
a
mr.
harrison
who
was
the
union's
and
this
brotherhood's
legislative
spokesman,
that
adjustments
of
minor
grievances
and
these
are
concededly
minor
grievances
is
made
compulsory
by
this
bill.
well,
in
--
in
one
sense
that
is
true.
the
bill
thus
provide
that
either
party
may,
without
the
consent
of
the
other,
submit
a
grievance
to
the
national
--
to
the
adjustment
board.
and
there's
no
doubt
that
as
long
as
the
man
--
if
--
if
the
employee
doesn't
acquiesce
in
that
board's
determination,
he
loses
very
valuable
rights.
he
can't
keep
his
job
and
sue
in
the
courts,
might
even
be
grounds
for
some
other
discharge.
but
we'd
say
that
the
compulsion
that
was
contemplated,
any
bill
that
has
any
efficacy
at
all
has
some
measure
of
compulsion.
but
we
say
that
this
bill
does
not
resuscitate
the
jurisdiction
of
federal
courts
to
enjoin
strikes
over
minor
grievances.
if
your
honors
please,
may
i
reserve
time
for
reply.
mr.
william
c.
wines
may
it
please,
your
honors.
in
the
central
of
georgia
case
which
would
have
been
argued
just
before
this
one
had
it
not
been
mooted
by
settlement.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit,
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice,
quote
just
a
few
lines
from
that
opinion
declared,
"if,
as
appellee
contends,
congress
had,
shortly
after
the
passage
of
the
norris-laguardia
act,
intended
to
curtail
its
provisions,
limiting
the
equity
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
in
labor
disputes
so
as
to
subject
strike
action
to
injunction,
it
is
inconceivable,
we
think,
that
it
would
not
expressly
have
so
provided.”
that
somehow
the
argument
for
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
but
i
want
to
reply
to
mr.
justice
black's
question
in
my
fashion.
mr.
justice
black
asked
whether
the
act
clearly
delineates
a
demarcation
between
major
grievances
and
minor
grievances.
your
honor,
mr.
justice
black,
i
would
say
fairly
clear
--
fairly
clear,
however,
these
--
these
observations
are
certainly
pertinent
and
we
think
exigent.
in
the
very
central
of
georgia
case,
there
was
a
dispute
as
to
whether
the
strike
was
over
a
major
or
a
minor
grievance.
what
the
men
struck
for
there
was
rights
which
though
in
a
sense
under
an
existing
contract
depended
on
a
dispute
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
contract
and
then
--
and
affected
not
only
particular
grievances
but
the
rights
of
all
other
members,
though
they
didn't
seek
a
modification
of
--
of
the
contract
but
simply
asserted
what
they
said
was
their
reading
of
it.
now,
the
truth
is
that
however
clear
or
unclear
maybe
the
lexicography
of
--
of
these
terms
in
the
statute
itself
even
if
a
strike
is
concededly
over
a
minor
grievance,
minor
being
conceived
and
defined
to
be
past
accumulated
grievances
like
decisions
of
the
courts,
the
settlement
of
those
grievances
also
for
any
precedents
and
the
patterns
and
point
the
way
to
the
future.
so
that
the
distinction
on
which
mr.
cummings
rely
so
confidently
in
his
argument
and
in
his
brief
between
major
and
minor
disputes
is
not
very
clear
in
economic
fact
even
if
it
is
fairly
easy
to
assign
a
strike
to
one
category
or
the
other
under
a
statute.
the
truth
of
it
is,
your
honors,
that
it
seems
to
us
as
it
seem
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
--
the
fifth
circuit,
that
if
congress
had
intended
to
emasculate
the
norris-laguardia
act,
well
mr.
cummings'
verb,
which
is
what
he
says
we're
trying
to
do
to
this
act,
it
would
have
done
so
in
clear
unmistakable
unequivocal
terms.
we
don't
contend
that
there's
an
express
continuation
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
we
do
say
that
--
that
repeal,
whether
express
or
implied,
must
find
--
must
either
be
uttered
or
evinced
in
terms
of
an
active
intention
to
continue
and
a
passive
intention
to
let
well
enough
alone
and
let
this
court
decide
is
not
congressional
repeal
of
any
statute,
certainly
not
one
so
important
as
the
norris-laguardia
act.
the
truth
of
it
is,
your
honors,
and
i
think
this
emerges
clearly
from
the
record
and
this
concludes
my
argument,
that
this
question
was
just
too
froth
with
implications
of
every
kind
for
congress
to
want
to
take
the
stand
of
repeal.
it
was
just
too
pregnant
with
all
kinds
of
conflicts
of
every
sort,
ideological
and
political.
and
congress,
we
say
with
major
deliberation,
left
matters
where
they
were,
left
it
all
alone.
although,
had
they
been
asked
explicitly
to
reaffirm
the
norris-laguardia
act
they
might
or
might
not
have
done
it.
they
left
the
problem
where
it
was.
it
was
a
little
too
full
of
--
of
dangers
of
all
kinds
and
we
think
that
they
did
not
intend
to
take
away
from
labor
the
right
that
they
had
bestowed
on
labor
only
two
years
ago.
