i
ask

justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
proceed
with
your
argument,
may
i
ask
you
if
you
will
state
the
--
is
what
you
--
let
me
put
it
this
way,
is
what
you've
stated
all
the
litigation
--
adjudication
thus
far
on
the
second
question
that
--
that
your
--
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
telling
us
what
the
--
what
the
sum
total
of
adjudications
on
the
norris-laguardia?
the
--
the
--
what
you
call
reinvesting
of
district
courts
with
jurisdiction.
there
are
these
two
courts
of
appeals,
what
else
is
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
speaking
of
strikes
that
do
not
bring
the
issuance
of
an
injunction
within
the
exceptions
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
namely,
the
question
--
the
second
question,
to
what
extent
does
the
norris-laguardia
act
limit,
assuming
otherwise
there
is
a
power
to
enjoin
strikes
not
within
the
exceptions
of
the
norris-laguardia
act,
to
what
extent
does
the
norris-laguardia
act
limit,
also
apply
to
the
controversies
arriving
under
the
national
--
under
the
railway
labor
act?
there
are
these
two
courts
of
appeals,
what
else
is
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
that's
--
that's
not
what
the
norris-laguardia
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
that
would
only
arrive
in
the
federal
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right,
and
i
know
of
no
other
decisions
on
these
minor
strikes.
there
are
a
number
of
decisions
to
which
i
shall
come,
if
i
have
the
time,
in
which
this
court
has
discussed
the
effect
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
on
strikes
involving
railroad
employees.
but
i
shall
show
your
honors
that
never
in
the
history
of
this
court
since
the
norris-laguardia
act
has
this
court
ever
sustained
an
injunction
sought
by
a
carrier,
though
it
has
sustained
injunction
sought
by
members
of
a
union
who
said
that
their
own
union
had
betrayed
them.
particularly,
it
sustained
injunctions
and
other
relief
when
sought
by
negroes
who
said
that
they
were
not
being
fairly
represented
by
various
railroad
brotherhoods
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
putting
those
on
one
side,
and
you're
also
of
course
putting
aside
proceedings
by
the
government
and
the
period
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
doesn't
apply
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i,
without
interrupting
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
your
argument,
ask
one
or
two
questions
to
focus
in
the
discussion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
first
place,
if
i
read
the
railway
labor
act
and
nothing
else,
will
i
--
will
i
have
a
--
get
an
answer
if
i
read
the,
as
one
should
have,
statute,
the
three
cardinal
rules
of
statutory
construction
to
read
a
statute
three
times?
would
i
get
the
answer
to
this
problem
by
just
reading
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
i
then
--
will
i
get
an
answer
one
way
or
the
other?
i
won't,
i'll
be
left
in
the
dark,
and
therefore
you
turn
into
the
legislative
history.
now,
if
i
read
the
legislative
history,
if
i
go
to
it,
do
i
find
a
report
of
either
committee
of
the
senate
or
house,
which
says
explicitly,
"we
have
divided
the
scheme
of
regulation
which
is
the
substitute
of
and
does
the
service
of
the
undesirable
strikes?"
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
the
legislative
history
will
leave
me
in
dark.
except,
is
that
what
you're
going
to
do,
that
there
emanate
from
it
some
general
motions
of
policy
which
we
then
will
translate
into
saying
it
does
or
it
doesn't
prohibit
strikes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
state
it
just
categorically
without
arguing
it
for
the
moment
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
a
different
--
you
don't
--
i
didn't
want
to
come
to
that
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
want
to
know
whether
--
i'm
not
--
i'm
putting
the
laguardia
act
to
one
side.
i
wanted
--
suppose
we
didn't
have
the
norris-laguardia
act
at
all,
suppose
that
hadn't
existed.
does
the
railway
labor
act
establish
a
regime,
a
scheme
of
regulation,
which
sets
up
this
complicated
inter
--
intra-industry
machinery
to
displace
what
theretofore
would
have
been
the
right
to
strike?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
no
to
what?
that
there
is
no
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know
you
--
that
is
your
position
but
what
i
want
to
know
is
do
i
get
that
answer
by
reading
the
statute?
you
said
no.
i'm
left
in
the
dark.
the
statute
doesn't
give
me
that
no
answer,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i
want
to
know.
does
the
legislative
history,
meaning
in
the
first
place,
a
committee
report
or
house
and
senate
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
statement
of
the
person
responsible
for
the
measure
on
the
house
or
senate
floor
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
conclusion
which
you
put
to
us,
you
derive
from
argumentative
considerations
of
general
policy,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
you
tell
us
what
shall
you
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
mr.
wolverton
said,
regarding
with
the
--
expressed
or
dealt
with
whether
it
should
be
or
should
not
be
in
the
bill.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
there's
a
--
do
you
think
that
desire
of
his
were
satisfied
by
what
--
not
by
what
inference
we
may
draw
but
what
they
did
or
didn't
do?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
are
still
in
the
dark.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
--
did
they
--
was
any
explicit
reference
made
to
norris-laguardia?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
mr.
wolverton
anywhere
talk
about
norris-laguardia?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
was
a
leading
member
of
his
committee.
he
was
in
the
house
when
the
norris-laguardia
act
was
passed.
memories
are
short
but
not
so
short
that
he
didn't
know
of
its
existence.
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
--
what
you
think
is
the
allowable
inference
to
be
drawn
from
that
that
you
quoted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
answer
is
that
it
isn't
admissible
under
the
parole
evidence
rule
and
that's
why
i'm
asking
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
--
assuming
this
is
admissible
for
purposes
of
argument,
what
strength
or
weight
or
light
do
i
get
from
it?
i
get
nothing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
that
mr.
wolverton
was
bothered
by
a
question
which
he
either
wasn't
able
to
or
eventually
didn't
care
to
get
an
answer
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
in
your
case
we
have
a
will
and
in
our
case
where
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
we
may
be
driven
to
do
the
best
we
can
to
say
what
is
the
most
harmonious
and
effective
way
of
construing
that
statute,
but
your
exegesis
doesn't
execute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suggested
--
i'm
riddled
to
it.
if
you've
got
no
outside
materials
which
help
me
to
read
what
the
statute
means,
i
must
get
meaning
out
of
the
statute,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
break
in,
mr.
cummings.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
miss
something.
did
you
say
that
--
or
state
again
if
you
will.
what
the
--
what
the
administrative
situation
was?
the
boards,
where
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
mean
the
--
the
abstract
technical
thing.
but
in
this
case
what
happened
in
regard
of
any
disputes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
they
are
still
pending?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
problem
at
all
that
in
any
event
that
board
should
dispose
of
its
--
the
matter
before
you
get
in
to
the
federal
courts,
assuming
you
could
at
any
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
i
--
but
i'm
putting
to
you
the
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
whether
or
not
a
federal
court
could
stay
its
hand
in
any
event
until
the
board
takes
care
of
the
dispute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
maybe
one
of
the
--
i'm
not
saying
it
is,
but
that
maybe
one
of
the
exigencies
of
the
inevitable
delays
and
adjudication,
either
before
administrative
bodies
or
before
agencies
of
this
sort
or
courts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
cummings,
as
what
you've
said
and
those
materials
establish
anything
more
than
that
submission
may
be
made
for
determination
by
the
adjustment
board
by
one
side,
although,
the
other
side
screams,
allowed
to
have
them
against
him.
does
it
do
anything
more
than
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
else
could
they
do?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
it
wouldn't
be
meaningless.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wouldn't
be
--
no,
because
that
presupposes
that
people
would
strike
if
this
is
done
and
it
presupposes
that
there
isn't
any
value
in
the
force
of
opinion
which
we
see
operating
now
in
another
plea,
that
by
that
act,
pressure
is
brought
to
bear
to
yield
to
something
which
if
they
weren't
that,
they
wouldn't
have
to
even
do
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
may
be
the
expression
of
a
hope.
it
doesn't
yet
take
me
over
to
saying
that
the
courts
can
intervene.
that
--
that's
--
you
have
to
go
some
distance
to
get
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
the
term
â€“-
where
are
the
terms
of
the
injunction?
where
did
the
grievance
go?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
connection
with
--
the
injunction
isn't
in
terms
to
allow
the
adjustment
board
holding
the
injunction
until
the
adjustment
board
decide,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
saying
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
--
can
you
shed
some
light
on
what
is
to
me
very
puzzling
why
nobody
talked
about
norris-laguardia?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i
mean
specifically.
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
cummings,
i'm
not
--
i
can
assure
you
my
mind
is
in
a
--
in
a
state
of
worry,
so
that
my
question
carries
no
innuendo.
i
just
think
it's
rather
surprising
that
within
so
short
of
time
of
the
enactment
of
a
measure
which
had
such
wide
and
deep
interest
in
the
congress
and
which
dealt
with
so
important
a
problem
outside
of
labor
relations.
namely,
what
task
should
be
put
upon
federal
courts
in
regard
to
these
difficult
controversies
that
that
shouldn't
have
been
adverted
to
at
all?(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
when
you
come
to
it
because
the
--
the
main
drive
and
the
main
concern
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
wasn't
strikes
or
no
strikes
involved
over
the
federal
courts'
--
in
this
controversy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
average
or
is
it
impossible
to
look
for
an
average
of
disposition
--
of
time
of
disposition
of
matters
before
the

justice

but
the
divisions
depend
on
the
type
of
question
before

a
submission
