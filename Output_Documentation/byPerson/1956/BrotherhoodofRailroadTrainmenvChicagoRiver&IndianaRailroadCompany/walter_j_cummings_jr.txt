mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
for
the
sake
of
time,
i
will
not
state
the
facts
of
the
case
because
they
are
not
in
dispute
except
to
give
a
brief
time
synopsis
of
what
occurred
here.
the
mediation
board
intervened
and
the
carrier
accepted
the
proposals
of
that
board
but
the
trainmen
refused
to.
next,
the
mediation
board
accepted
arbitration
and
the
carrier
was
willing
but
the
trainmen
were
not.
at
that
point
the
carrier
filed
the
grievances
with
the
adjustment
board
as
soon
as
the
mediation
board
withdrew
from
the
case.
instead
of
permitting
the
board
to
process
these
21
grievances,
the
trainmen
then
called
their
strike
over
them.
our
first
point
is
that
the
adjustment
procedure,
established
by
the
1934
railway
labor
act,
is
mandatory.
of
course
the
major
disputes,
those
that
involve
the
negotiation
of
terms
of
employment
and
these
minor
disputes,
the
ones
that
are
considerably
involved
here
have
been
treated
differently
by
the
statute
and
we
did
not
consider
the
major
disputes
here.
these
minor
disputes
do
not
involve
the
making
of
collective
agreements
which
involve
all
employees.
instead
they
are
defined
in
the
act
as
the
grievances
or
disputes
over
questions
involving
the
interpretation
or
application
of
existing
contracts.
the
respondents
concede
that
strikes
over
major
disputes
--
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
sure.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
the
major
disputes
go
to
the
mediation
board
--
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
these
very
disputes
were
filed
by
the
carrier,
your
honor,
as
soon
as
the
mediation
board
withdrew.
the
mediation
board
couldn't
do
anything
else
after
arbitration
was
refused.
and
it
was
at
that
point
that
the
carrier
took
the
claims
to
the
board,
where
they
are
still
pending.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
yes,
they
are.
the
first
division
where
these
cases
were
large
is
behind
in
its
work.
it's
one
of
the
few
divisions
that
is
so
congested.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
i
don't
think
it'll
be
disposed
of
for
several
months,
your
honor,
if
that's
what
you
mean.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
yes.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
well,
the
board
wouldn't
be
able
--
the
board
wouldn't
be
able
to
take
care
of
this
dispute
if
the
court
stayed
its
hand
because
the
strike
would
have
force
the
carrier
to
some
sort
of
settlement.
the
board
would
have
lost
its
function.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
well,
in
this
case
at
any
rate
they
are
still
pending
in
the
board
and
if
the
court
had
stayed
its
hand
they
would
not
of
course
be
pending
on
the
board,
they
would
have
been
disposed
of
otherwise.
we
do
concede
that
strikes
over
the
major
disputes
are
permissible
after
the
process
of
the
act
have
been
exhausted.
we
don't
contend
otherwise.
but
in
our
view
the
railway
act
of
1934
requires
that
grievances,
these
individual
cases,
be
processed
by
the
adjustment
board
or
a
system
board
under
section
3,
second,
if
they
have
progressed
beyond
the
carrier.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
3,
second,
your
honor.
that
appears
in
our
appendix
also.
under
the
1926
act
the
adjustment
procedure
was
of
course
voluntary
but
in
1934,
at
the
union's
request,
congress
replaced
this
voluntary
machinery
with
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
machinery.
the
same
time,
it
added
five
general
purposes
to
the
act.
first
was
to
avoid
any
interruption
to
commerce
or
to
the
operation
of
any
carrier
engaged
therein.
the
fifth
was
to
provide
for
the
orderly
settlement
of
grievances.
this
strike
would
violate
both
those
purposes
as
well
as
the
statutory
duty
imposed
in
section
2,
first,
on
all
carriers
and
their
employees
to
exert
every
reasonable
effort
to
settle
all
disputes.
but
the
section
directly
involved
here
is
section
3,
first
(i).
that
was
enacted
in
1934
and
specifically
provides
for
grievances
to
be
referred
to
the
adjustment
board
by
either
party,
either
party
has
the
right
to
take
them
to
the
board.
and
as
i
explained
a
little
earlier,
they
were
so
referred
in
this
instance
by
the
carrier
that
the
adjustment
board
may
not
be
deprived
of
its
jurisdiction
by
the
strike,
the
machinery
really
becomes
meaningless.
the
board
wouldn't
have
anything
to
do.
the
railway
labor
executives'
association
brief
concedes
that
congress
and
either
party
had
either
a
selection
to
submit
such
disputes
that
were
not
settled
on
the
property
to
the
adjustment
board.
petitioners
made
the
same
concession
in
their
brief
below
and
mr.
wines
adhered
to
it
orally
today.
so
that
it
seems
plain
that
under
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
that
either
party
can
go
to
the
adjustment
board
whether
or
not
the
other
is
willing,
and
the
legislative
history
certainly
crystal
clear
to
that
effect.
the
manager
of
the
bill
was
senator
dill,
who
was
chairman
of
the
senate
committee
on
interstate
commerce.
he
explained
the
bill
to
his
fellow
senators
before
they
voted
on
it,
and
in
the
debate
he
said
that
they
were
voting
on
a
bill
back
and
agreed
to
by
the
railroad
labor
organizations
and
providing
compulsory
arbitration
of
grievances.
that's
what
he
felt
was
so
striking
about
this
measure,
it
was
the
first
time
that
that
kind
of
a
statute
have
been
agreed
to.
and
the
federal
coordinator
of
transportation,
commissioner
joseph
eastman
was
the
chief
draftsman
of
this
bill.
his
final
explanation
of
it,
not
the
explanation
mr.
wines
quoted.
his
final
explanation
appears
in
his
june
1934
letter
to
president
roosevelt
and
which
was
read
on
the
floor
of
the
senate.
in
that
letter
he
stated
that
the
1934
bill
provides
for
compulsory
adjustment
of
grievances.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
no,
this
was
mr.
eastman
--
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
--
your
honor.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
it's
at
page
26
of
our
brief,
mr.
justice
clark.
the
railroad
labor
organizations
including
these
very
petitioners
and
their
two
amici
were
represented
at
the
hearings
by
george
harrison
who
is
chairman
of
the
legislative
committee
of
the
railway
labor
executives'
association
and
president
of
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
clerks.
he
was
the
spokesman
for
the
railroad
labor
organizations
at
these
hearings,
and
he
too
stated
his
understanding
that
section
3,
first
(i)
was
to
provide
compulsory
determination
of
grievances.
the
next
witnesses
were
the
spokesman
for
the
railroads
and
although
they
opposed
the
language
of
the
bill,
they
agreed
with
mr.
harrison,
commissioner
eastman
and
senator
dill
on
this
point
that
the
bill
did
provide
for
compulsory
determination
of
grievances.
the
chief
opponent
of
the
legislation
was
the
international
brotherhood
of
teamsters
and
the
two
reasons
they
oppose
the
bill
was
because
first,
they
said
it
brought
about
the
compulsory
arbitration
of
grievances,
and
secondly,
because
it
would
prevent
striking
over
them.
in
other
words,
the
opponents
and
the
spokesman
and
the
draftsman
all
agreed
on
this
point.
the
judicial
construction
has
been
to
the
same
effect.
the
early
case
in
this
court
was
the
first
to
consider
extensively,
the
1934
adjustment
board
machinery.
after
examining
the
legislative
history
of
this
act
in
great
detail,
justice
rutledge
concluded
that
as
a
safeguard
of
the
public.
each
party
to
a
dispute
of
this
nature
may
submit
it
to
the
adjustment
board
for
decision
whether
or
not
the
other
is
willing
in
contrast
to
what
he
termed
was
the
previous
system
of
voluntary
arbitration.
and
the
very
opinion
expressed,
he
relied
on
george
harrison's
testimony,
to
which
i
adverted
a
minute
ago,
that
the
bill
does
provide
for
compulsory
determination
of
grievances.
and
--
and
in
return
for
that
legislation,
labor
was
giving
up
the
right
to
strike
over
these
minor
disputes.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
george
harrison,
who
was
the
railroad
labor
spokesman
at
the
hearings.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
yes,
it
does
because
it
would
be
--
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
--
it
would
be
meaningless
if
it
permitted
the
strikes
to
go
on
over
there
because
--
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
well,
the
board
would
be
deprived
of
its
jurisdiction.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
well,
all
the
statements
to
which
i
referred
of
mr.
eastman,
mr.
harrison,
and
so
forth
did
state
that
this
was
to
replace
strikes
over
grievances.
it
was
a
substitute
for
them.
the
adjustment
board
was
to
be
the
final
arbiter.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
well,
to
get
there
i
think
i
have
to
make
a
point
that
this
procedure
is
mandatory,
and
i
hope
i
am
making
that
point,
that
you
have
to
go
to
the
adjustment
board.
if
you
assume
that
you
have
to
go
to
the
adjustment
board
then
the
only
way
to
enforce
those
provisions
in
this
instance
is
to
let
the
adjustment
board
function,
to
let
it
go
ahead
to
decision.
that's
all
this
injunction
attempts
to
do
to
preserve
the
status
quo
so
that
the
board
can
decide
the
case.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
it
is
at
page
49
and
50
of
the
record,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
and
the
form
of
the
injunction
was
submitted
to
the
petitioners
before
it
was
entered
by
the
district
court
for
their
comments.
they
had
no
objections
to
it
and
still
have
not
complained
of
its
form
at
all.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
you
see
it's
limited
to
the
grievances
now
pending
in
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board,
that's
the
whole
purpose
of
it
to
maintain
the
status
quo.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
that's
all
it's
meant
to
do.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
perhaps
not
in
its
terms
but
that's
what
it's
meant
to
do
and
was
so
understood
by
both
sides
and
by
the
court.
and
we
don't
contend
that
it
should
do
anything
else.
even
as
to
the
major
disputes
in
the
burley
case,
the
court
stated
that
it
was
compulsory
for
the
parties
to
submit
to
the
successive
procedures
of
the
act
before
they
could
resort
to
self-help.
this
had
really
been
true
under
the
1926
act
as
recognized
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
the
labor
injunction
where
the
author
stated
that
the
1926
act
permits
the
right
to
strike
only
after
prescribed
methods
of
compromise
in
arbitration
have
been
tried
in
for
refutal.
well,
that's
true
as
to
the
major
disputes,
the
important
ones
in
the
labor
world,
it
certainly
apply
to
these
minor
disputes.
the
burley
case
does
not
stand
alone
on
this.
the
other
decisions
of
this
court
also
point
to
the
exclusive
procedure
of
the
adjustment
board,
and
they
are
discussed
adequately
in
our
brief,
and
i
will
not
go
to
them
orally.
what
has
the
practice
been
under
this
1934
act?
well,
for
the
first
15
years
there
were
no
strikes
at
all
over
the
grievances,
showing
that
labor
certainly
agreed
with
what
their
spokesman
had
said
and
what
the
draftsman
had
said
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
1934
adjustment
board
procedures.
court
will
recall
that
the
adjustment
board
is
composed
equally
of
representatives
of
both
the
labor
unions
and
the
carriers.
a
vice
president
of
these
very
trainmen
sits
on
this
division,
the
division
--
first
division
which
is
involved
here.
at
least
two-thirds
of
the
decisions
of
the
board
have
been
in
the
favor
--
in
favor
of
labor
so
that
petitioners
have
nothing
to
fear
from
permitting
these
grievances
to
be
processed
by
the
adjustment
board.
modern
thought
in
all
labor
cases,
railroad
as
well
as
non-railroad
labor
cases,
is
recognizing
that
grievances
are
particularly
adjustable
by
a
form
of
arbitration.
that
is
because,
as
my
opponent
has
recognized,
they
are
individual
cases
involving
accrued
rights
growing
out
of
existing
contracts.
that
waspointed
out
by
mr.
harrison
in
his
1934
article
in
the
american
federation,
shortly
following
the
enactment
of
this
in
which
he
appreciated
that
the
adjudication
by
the
adjustment
board
would
be
a
proper
way
of
disposing
of
these
grievances.
as
recognized
by
the
amicus
brotherhood's
brief
and
award
in
favor
of
the
petitioners
are
almost
certainly
to
be
honored
by
the
carrier,
that
if
not,
petitioners
have
been
given
a
very
liberal
remedy,
weighted
in
their
favor,
enforcement
suit.
that
type
of
suit
permits
very
limited
review
in
the
correctness
of
an
award
of
the
adjustment
board.
the
findings,
in
order
of
the
board,
are
made
prima
facie
evidence
cost
or
tax
to
the
government
under
the
successful
the
petitioners
recovered
the
reasonable
attorney's
fees.
the
construction
of
section
3,
first
by
the
court
below
does
not
hurt
the
employees
but
benefits
them,
we
believe,
since
it
is
to
their
interest
to
avoid
saturation
of
work
and
loss
of
pay
during
adjustment
proceedings.
petitioners
must
think
it
is
better
to
throw
everybody
out
of
work
to
enforce
the
demands
of
a
few,
when
there
are
only
a
few
involved
here,
rather
than
for
everybody
to
work
while
those
aggrieved
are
obtaining
remedies
by
early
processes,
rather
than
and
go
into
the
donnell
bill,
it
was
the
1950
bill,
i
will
rely
on
our
brief
which
discusses
that
at
page
48
and
following.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
there
weren't
any
strikes
until
1949
and
then
they
started
out
to
be
very
few,
and
now
they're
increasing
slightly.
there
had
been
four
--
perhaps
four
or
five
a
year
in
the
last
two
years.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
it's
the
first
lawsuit
to
reach
this
court
or
at
least
to
be
--
and
decided
by
this
court,
the
central
of
georgia
case
was
a
related
case.
but
if
the
trainmen
were
right
about
that
case
that
involved
the
major
disputes
and
not
the
minor
disputes,
so
it
does
not
have
any
effect
here.
and
moreover,
the
majority
opinion
in
that
case
did
not
go
into
the
railway
labor
act
at
all.
it
was
devoted
exclusively
in
the
norris-laguardia
act.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
they
didn't
talk
about
norris-laguardia
specifically,
mr.
justice.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
they
--
but
they
did
talk
about
injunction
--
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
--
which
i'm
going
to
point
to
in
my
norris-laguardia
point.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
it
was
not
adverted
to.
neither
side
has
found
any
reference
to
it
in
the
1934
hearings
or
the
dates.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
that's
--
that's
correct.
as
already
shown,
the
labor
act
does
provide
for
compulsory
arbitration
of
grievances.
actually,
the
petitioners'
brief
practically
concedes
this
point
first,
devoted
on
this
page
--
that
page
to
the
norris-laguardia
point.
and
since
the
adjustment
board
is
empowered
to
decide
grievances,
an
injunction
was
proper
for
otherwise,
as
i
mentioned
earlier
it
could
not
be
permitted
to
--
it
would
not
be
permitted
to
perform
its
statutory
function.
that
was
the
effect
of
the
strike
and
the
court
below
found
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
strike.
even
the
petitioners
have
conceded
that
any
other
remedy
would
be
inadequate,
a
strike
would
hurt
not
only
this
carrier,
its
1100
employees,
600
industries
served,
27
connecting
carriers,
but
more
important
the
public.
this
carrier
is
the
only
railroad
operating
in
the
chicago
stockyards,
an
embargo
on
all
shipments
into
and
out
of
stockyards
would
result
from
the
strike
and
that
is
admitted.
there
is
nothing
draconian
about
this
injunction.
we
attempted
to
draw
it
narrowly.
we
purposely
have
a
provision
in
there
following
the
proviso
of
section
2,
tenth,
and
it
is
designed
only
to
permit
the
adjustment
board
to
perform
its
statutory
functions
of
making
award
in
these
cases.
it's
not
the
kind
of
blanket
injunction
in
which
the
norris-laguardia
act
is
directed.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
it
depends
on
the
division,
your
honor.
some
of
the
divisions
are
very
well
caught
up
and
you
can
get
a
decision
in
60
to
80
days.
in
this
particular
instance,
if
the
trainmen
had
filed
an
answer,
the
two
reinstatement
grievances
would
have
been
reached
within
four
or
five
months.
but
no
answer
has
been
filed
yet
by
the
trainmen.
they're
resisting
the
adjustment
board
procedures,
so
nothing
has
been
done
and
as
to
any
of
the
grievances
there.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
they
depend
on
the
type
of
employees
involved.
and
at
one
time
this
division
was
quite
well
caught
up
because
it
appointed
regional
boards
under
section
3,
first
(w).
they
existed
for
several
years
but
then
the
labor
members
withdrew
their
authorization
of
section
3,
first
(w).
there
are
two
avenues
to
reduce
this
congestion,
three
really,
section
3,
first
(k),
section
3,
first
(w),
and
section
3,
second.
here
the
carrier
has
done
all
it
can
under
the
railway
labor
act,
but
as
the
petitioners
who
refuse
to
exhaust
their
remedies
thereunder.
we
would
like
to
make
it
plain
that
if
the
adjustment
board
procedure
is
not
mandatory
under
the
act
we
do
not
claim
to
be
entitled
to
an
injunction.
our
position
--
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
we
do
not
claim
to
be
entitled
to
an
injunction,
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
--
unless
the
adjustment
board
provisions
are
mandatory.
the
provisions
i
discussed
at
the
beginning
of
the
argument.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
it
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
yes,
correctly.
our
position
simply
is
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
does
not
prevent
the
courts
from
enforcing
the
railway
labor
act,
and
that
is
what
we
are
attempting
to
do
here.
the
injunction
awarded
below
is
the
only
means
of
enforcing
section
3,
first
procedure.
all
we
are
asking
the
court
to
do
is
again
to
adopt
the
argument
that
the
government
made
in
the
virginian
case.
we
excerpted
the
government's
brief
it
appears
at
page
67
of
our
brief.
the
nub
of
it
is
that
the
--
when
in
conflict,
the
specific
terms
of
the
later
act
must
prevail
over
the
general
provisions
of
the
earlier.
there,
the
court
held
unanimously,
you
will
recall
that
the
provisions
of
the
1934
railway
labor
act
used
the
words
of
mr.
justice
stone,
rendered
nugatory
the
earlier
and
more
general
provisions
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
that
case
was
not
unprecedented,
it
followed
another
unanimous
decision
that
in
the
railway
clerks
case
involving
section
20
of
the
clayton
act,
that
courts
should
grant
injunctions
to
enforce
the
railway
labor
act.
and
the
rule
of
this
railway
clerks
case
was
very
familiar
to
the
draftsman
of
the
1934
act
as
it
appears
in
the
hearings.
in
other
words,
the
draftsman
knew
that
injunctions
need
not
be
specifically
mentioned
in
the
1934
measure
for
enforcement
to
be
awarded.
in
the
burley
case,
too,
it
was
noted
that
the
commands
of
the
railway
labor
act
including
this
very
section
3,
first
(i)
are
judicially
enforceable.
we
believe
that
the
contention
that
the
petitioner
is
making
here
was
under
the
norris-laguardia
act
was
already
rejected
by
this
court
in
the
howard
case
in
343
u.s.
they're
the
same
petitioners.
the
brotherhoods
of
--
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
had
used
strike
threats
to
force
the
carrier
to
bar
negroes
from
certain
duties.
as
here,
their
principal
reliance
in
this
court
was
on
the
norris-laguardia
act.
but
nevertheless,
the
court
held
in
the
howard
case
that
the
district
court
has
jurisdiction
and
power
to
issue
necessary
injunctive
orders
notwithstanding
the
provisions
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
and
the
district
court
was
told
to
award
appropriate
relief
which
would
necessarily
have
the
effect
of
enjoining
further
strike
threats.
norris-laguardia
act
makes
no
exception
for
negroes,
so
that
it
seems
apparent
that
in
the
howard,
graham,
steel,
and
tunstall
cases,
this
court
was
recognizing
that
congress
does
not
mean
the
commands
of
the
1934
act
to
become
elusory
because
of
the
--
the
norris-laguardia
act.
a
case
very
like
the
howard
case
was
decided
by
the
eighth
circuit
also
involving
this
--
the
same
trainmen,
the
rolfes
case.
there
the
trainmen
struck
over
certain
grievances
of
dining
cars
stewards.
and
the
court
held
that
the
rival
waiters-in-charge
were
entitled
to
resort
to
the
adjustment
board,
and
an
injunction
was
issued
against
the
trainmen
permitted
fairly
with
the
opportunity
for
the
adjustment
board
to
function
as
contemplated
by
the
railway
labor
act.
after
citing
the
graham,
virginian,
steel,
and
tunstall
cases,
the
eighth
circuit
ruled
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
does
not
deprive
the
federal
courts
or
to
issue
an
injunction
in
aid
of
the
adjustment
board,
and
to
preserve
the
right
of
the
adjustment
board
procedure
--
to
resort
to
the
adjustment
board
procedure
provided
by
congress
under
the
1934
act.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
no,
there
are
not.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
there
are
not,
mr.
justice.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
no.
none
at
all.
this
is
the
only
means
we
have
been
enforced
with.
mr.
wines
relied
on
the
--
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
yes.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
yes.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
yes,
sir.
but
they
award
--
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
yes,
an
enforcement
suit.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
well,
that
--
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
no
matter
what
the
award
was
whether
it
was
for
money
or
for
some
other
redress
an
enforcement
suit
can
be
brought
under
the
act.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
yes,
surely,
in
any
kind
of
case.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
i
was
talking
about
the
employees'
rights,
your
honor.
the
employees
are
given
the
right
to
file
an
enforcement
suit.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
yes,
surely,
he
could
--
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
oh,
an
enforcement
suit?
i
would
say
--
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
--
there
would
be
an
enforcement
suit.
yes.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
they're
denied
any
relief?
there's
nothing
to
enforce
of
course
then
--
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
well,
that's
not
necessary
to
decide
in
this
case.
the
legislative
history
indicates
quite
clearly
that
they
could
not
strike,
could
not
--
that's
not
involved
here.
we
don't
have
to
go
into
that.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
it
would
depend
whether
the
enforcement
suit
would
be
held
their
exclusive
remedy
it
may
not
be.
as
you
know,
they
have
common
law
rights
to
go
into
courts
in
certain
instances
such
as
the
moore
case
and
the
(inaudible)
case.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
exactly.
their
only
remedies
--
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
that's
our
point.
you
can
enjoin
because
congress
has
devised
an
exclusive
self-contained
system,
it
has
to
be
enforced
somehow.
that's
what
we're
attempting
to
do
here.
mr.
wines
relied
heavily
on
the
central
of
georgia
case
on
the
norris-laguardia
point.
but
as
i
stated
a
little
earlier
the
trainmen
there
assert
that
that
involves
a
major
dispute.
and
if
so
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
result
on
the
central
of
georgia
case
at
all.
it
involves
a
minor
dispute,
a
grievance.
we
think
that
judge
brown's
dissent
was
correct.
the
petitioner
has
conceded
below
that
it
would
be
proper
to
enjoin
even
strikes
over
major
disputes
in
violation
of
sections
5,
first
(b)
and
10
of
the
railway
labor
act.
they
have
no
specific
clauses
as
to
injunctions
either,
and
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
permits
injunctions
there
that
permits
injunctions
equally
here.
hardly
any
of
the
commands
of
the
railway
labor
act
are
self-executing
but
that
has
not
been
held
to
preclude
judicial
relief.
the
amicus
railway
labor
executive
association
admits
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
does
not
apply
upon
when
the
court
is
called
upon
to
compel
compliance
with
positive
mandates
of
the
railway
labor
act.
that
is
all
we
are
seeking
here.
that
is
our
position,
that
we
are
seeking
compliance
with
mandatory
provisions
of
the
act.
the
debates
on
the
norris-laguardia
act
of
course
preceded
by
two
years,
the
enactment
of
the
1934
provisions
on
which
we
rely
in
the
railway
labor
act.
nevertheless,
it
is
of
interest
to
know
what
representative
laguardia
stated
as
the
effect
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
other
than
railway
labor
act.
and
this
passage
is
not
cited
in
our
brief.
i
came
across
it
when
preparing
for
argument.
colloquy
occurs
at
75
cong.
rec.
5499,
mr.
laguardia
stated,
"we
then
passed
the
railroad
labor
act
and
that
takes
care
of
the
whole
labor
situation
pertaining
to
the
railroads.
they
could
not
possibly
come
under
this
for
the
reason
that
we've
provided
the
machinery
there
for
settling
labor
disputes.
and
then
mr.
lankford
of
virginia
askedhim,
"the
norris-laguardia
act
does
not
apply
to
the
transportation
of
milk
or
other
necessities
that
go
in
interstate
commerce?"
mr.
laguardia,
"interstate
traffic
is
entirely
covered
in
the
railroad
labor
act
of
1926."
now
then,
a
little
later
in
the
debate
at
page
5504
and
this
is
the
last
quotation
expect
to
make,
he
stated,
"so
that
there
is
the
tie
up
between
the
provisions
of
the
railroad
labor
act
and
the
necessity
of
exhausting
every
remedy
to
adjust
any
difference
which
might
arise.
the
workers
could
not
and
would
not
think
of
going
on
strike
before
all
the
remedies
provided
in
the
law,
referring
to
the
railway
labor
law,
have
been
exhausted."
that
sentence
has
repetition
here
because
it's
so
apt.
the
workers
could
not
and
indeed
would
not
think
of
going
on
strike
before
all
the
remedies
provided
the
railway
labor
law
had
been
exhausted.
if
the
carriers
have
complied,
they
would
not
be
deprived
of
any
relief
which
they
may
have
law
or
in
equity.
well,
applying
his
remarks
here
would
require
affirmance.
but
injunctions
were
discussed
in
the
house
hearings
on
this
very
legislation
in
connection
with
grievances.
mr.
eastman
referred
his
questionnaires
to
mr.
carmalt
who
was
the
co-draftsman
of
the
act
and
mr.
eastman's
legal
adviser.
and
mr.
carmalt
stated
that
an
injunction
would
lie
to
enjoin
strikes
over
grievances.
and
mr.
eastman
himself
--
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
that
is
shown
at
page
33,
i
believe
of
our
brief,
your
honor,
the
blue-cut
brief.
yes,
that's
correct.
the
last
quotation.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
mr.
eastman,
in
connection
with
grievances,
discussed
a
proviso
that
was
added
in
1934
of
the
act.
that's
the
proviso
to
section
2,
tenth.
it
appears
at
78
of
our
brief.
and
in
pertinent
part
it
says
that
nor
shall
any
court
issue
any
process
to
compel
a
performance
by
an
individual
employee
of
such
labor
or
service
without
his
consent.
and
mr.
eastman
again
discussing
grievances,
he
explained
this
proviso
in
the
passage
quoted
at
pages
30
and
31
of
our
brief
that
now
that
proviso
protects
the
individual
who
wants
to
walk
out
but
it
does
not
cover
collective
action
in
walking
out.
and
mr.
carmalt
also
explained
this
proviso.
he
said
that
the
employees,
when
they
submitted
the
draft
of
the
bill,
absolve
collective
action
but
that
both
he
and
mr.
eastman
had
instead
redrafted
the
statute
to
provide
the
present
verbiage
section
2,
tenth
in
order
not
to
permit
collective
action
just
to
permit
the
individual
action.
the
reason
for
mr.
eastman's
feeling
on
this
matter
was
to
use
his
language
that
the
bill
makes
it
a
matter
of
duty
on
the
parties
to
this
dispute,
that
the
law
is
in
effect
in
agreement
on
the
part
of
the
parties
to
arbitrate
all
of
these
minor
disputes.
and
then
he
stated
his
opinion
that
there
ought
not
to
be
any
strikes
over
grievances
and
minor
disputes
but
that
he
was
unwilling
to
take
away
from
employees
the
right
to
strike
on
major
issues,
of
course
this
case
does
not
concern
the
major
issues.
there
would
have
been
no
need
for
the
addition
to
the
act
of
the
proviso
in
section
2,
tenth
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
permit
to
apply.
as
noted
by
judge
brown
in
his
dissent
in
the
central
of
georgia
case,
the
problem
was
really
one
of
accommodating
the
two
statutes
rather
than
determining
whether
one
repeals
the
other
pro
tanto.
it
should
be
noted,
nevertheless,
that
section
8
of
the
1934
statute
does
state
that
all
parts
are
--
all
acts
or
parts
of
acts
inconsistent
with
this
act
are
hereby
repealed.
this
provision
furnishes
an
additional
basis
for
the
holdings
of
the
virginian,
steele,
tunstall,
graham,
and
howard
cases
on
which
we
rely.
it
should
be
made
explicit
that
the
injunction
in
this
case
does
not
impinge
on
the
policies
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
for
it
does
not
take
sides
at
all.
it
permits
these
individual
grievances
to
be
settled
without
throwing
everybody
else
out
of
work.
the
petitioners
prevail
before
the
board.
they
will
of
course
receive
back
pay.
here,
all
the
parties
and
the
public
are
--
are
protected
by
requiring
that
these
grievances
be
settled
by
the
administrative
body
that
congress
chose
to
settle
them.
the
evils
that
which
the
norris-laguardia
act
was
aimed
are
not
present
here,
after
all
these
are
minor
disputes.
congress
picked
a
board
for
their
settlement
as
mr.
eastman
called
the
final
arbiter
and
mr.
harrison
a
little
more
picturesque
when
he
called
the
fire
department
to
settle
all
these
disputes.
if
the
decision
below
is
reversed
the
adjustment
board
will
be
left
to
vegetate
with
no
functions.
the
brotherhoods
will
feel
free
to
strike
over
grievances
instead
of
permitting
them
to
be
decided
by
the
board.
thus
the
adjustment
board
provisions
would
become
a
mockery
of
what
was
intended
by
congress.
in
conclusion
it
should
be
noted
that
the
respondents
are
not
asserting
that
the
railway
labor
act
ban
strikes
over
the
major
disputes
to
the
process
as
the
act
has
been
exhausted.
this
case
concerns
only
the
minor
disputes
and
the
principal
purpose.
in
fact
mr.
eastman
described
that
as
the
most
important
part
of
the
bill
was
to
provide
compulsory
arbitration
of
those
disputes
by
the
adjustment
board.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
yes,
it
does,
mr.
justice,
as
--
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
as
--
as
the
only
grievances
or
disputes
over
interpretation
or
application
of
existing
contracts.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
yes,
that's
right.
the
decisions
under
the
railway
labor
and
norris-laguardia
acts
make
it
plain
that
the
courts
are
meant
to
enforce
the
provisions
of
the
railway
labor
act.
unless
this
mandatory
duty
to
process
grievances
before
the
adjustment
board
is
enforced
strikes
over
grievances
will
continue
to
multiply,
although,
the
adjustment
board
was
designed
to
eliminate
those
various
strikes.
it
must
be
remembered
that
congress
enacted
this
1934
adjustment
board
provisions
upon
the
demands
of
the
labor
organizations.
the
board
was
established
to
provide
a
peaceful
form
for
the
adjudication
of
these
minor
disputes
without
the
hardship
of
strikes.
the
board
has
proved
to
be
hospitable
to
the
claims
of
employees
and
we
submit
should
not
emasculated
down.
