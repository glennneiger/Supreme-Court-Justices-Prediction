justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
may
it
please
the
court.
the
ultimate
question
presented
for
decision
in
this
case
is
raised
by
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
that
question
is
whether
the
federal
district
court
has
authority
in
a
suit
brought
under
section
301
(a)
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
to
compel
compliance
by
an
employer
with
his
contract
to
arbitrate
disputes,
arising
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
the
union,
which
union
represents
employees
in
an
industry
affecting
commerce.
the
same
question
with
some
minor
variations
is
presented
in
the
two
cases
which
follow
on
the
docket.
i
shall
not,
of
course,
attempt
to
argue
those
cases
for
counseling
those
cases,
although
one
is
my
colleague,
but
i
should
like
to
indicate
to
the
court
what
questions
are
common
to
all
three
cases
in
presenting
the
lincoln
mills
case
to
the
court.
before
doing
so,
however,
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
and
appropriate
if
i
give
a
resume
of
the
salient
facts.
the
petitioner,
textile
workers
union
of
america,
formerly
cio
and
now
afl-cio,
is
a
labor
organization
representing
the
employees
of
the
respondent,
lincoln
mills
of
huntsville,
alabama.
this
company
owns
and
operates
a
textile
mill
in
huntsville.
the
company
is
engaged
in
an
industry
affecting
commerce
and
is
subject
to
the
labor
relations
act
of
1947.
in
june
of
1953,
the
parties
entered
into
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
agreement
which
is
reproduced
in
the
record,
is
the
usual
type
of
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
key
to
the
argument
and
decision
of
this
case
as
the
fact
that
this
agreement
contained
a
no-strike
clause
on
the
part
of
the
union
and
a
common
agreement
as
a
consideration
therefore
to
arbitrate
disputes
arising
in
the
construction
and
termination
of
the
contract.
the
agreement
contains
the
usual
grievance
machinery,
which
is
applicable
today
to
most
collective
bargaining
agreements.
it
is
a
three-step
grievance
machinery,
and
the
fourth
step
of
the
grievance
machinery
is
arbitration.
and
i
want
in
a
moment
to
distinguish
between
the
different
types
of
arbitration
involved
and
particularly
the
one
involved
in
this
case.
the
complaint
in
this
case
and
the
controversy
in
this
case
involves
10
grievances,
filed
by
the
union
in
the
first
step
of
the
grievance
procedure
in
june
of
1954.
the
grievances,
and
it
is
important
to
note
what
they
are,
are
found
on
page
19
to
28
of
the
record.
these
grievances
are
concerned
with
workloads
and
work
assignments,
not
an
uncommon
grievance
in
a
textile
plant
or
for
that
matter,
in
other
plants.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
i
think
later,
when
i
discuss
the
impact
of
the
westinghouse
case,
i
will
develop
the
relevancy
of
the
type
of
grievance
to
the
issues
in
this
case.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
hope
not,
but
i
am
constrained
by
the
westinghouse
decision
to
mention
that
fact.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
might
say,
your
honors,
that
just
the
other
day,
too
late
to
include
in
the
brief,
i
received
the
annual
report
of
the
american
arbitration
association
for
this
year.
the
type
of
grievance
involved
here
is
becoming
an
increasingly
large
part
of
grievances
which
are
subject
to
arbitration
proceedings
and
collective
bargaining
agreement.
and
it
may
be
interesting
to
note
what
these
grievances
are
according
to
the
history
of
the
american
arbitration
association.
25%
of
the
total
amount
of
grievance
arbitrations
heard
in
1956
relate
to
discharge
and
other
forms
of
discipline.
23%
include
job
evaluation,
workload
and
wage
incentives
in
which
category
of
these
grievances
rest.
30%
of
the
total,
relate
to
seniority,
and
6%
of
the
total
are
overtime
and
then
there's
a
minor
amount.
this
is
contained
in
the
1956
annual
report
of
the
american
arbitration
association.
i
want
to
ask
counsel
if
you
might
want
to
look
at
it.
now,
the
--
the
grievances
in
this
case
are
covered
by
a
special
section
of
the
labor
contract.
this
is
article
v
which
is
found
in
the
record
on
pages
11
and
13.
the
reason
for
the
special
treatment
is
that
in
conjunction
with
any
arbitration
proceeding
of
grievances
of
this
character,
it
was
provide
--
it
was
provided
that
while
the
american
arbitration
association
might
select
the
arbitrator,
it
should
be
done
from
--
the
arbitrator
should
be
a
person
having
special
knowledge
of
this
particular
type
of
problem.
this
also
is
not
uncommon
because
there
are
many
contracts
that
with
reference
to
matters
of
industrial
engineering,
call
for
this
type
of
special
arbitration
machinery,
although
many
contracts,
of
course,
do
not.
now,
under
article
v
of
the
agreement,
the
company
had
the
right
to
make
changes
of
this
type
based
upon
some
management
and
engineering
practice
upon
written
notice.
the
union
was
required
and
the
employees
in
the
plant
were
required
to
work
under
the
change
made
by
the
management
for
a
four-week
period
to
give
it
a
fair
try.
and
then,
if
they
were
not
satisfied
with
the
situation
that
developed,
the
grievance
could
be
filed
and
ultimately,
arbitration
could
be
held.
the
--
in
the
--
in
the
instant
case,
the
grievances
were
processed
by
the
union
through
various
steps
of
the
grievance
procedure.
they
were
finally
denied
by
the
company
on
july
14th,
15th
and
22nd
of
1954.
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
had
expired
pursuant
to
notice
under
its
terms
on
july
3rd,
1954.
the
--
i
have
tried
to
check
independently
of
the
record
as
to
what
happened
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
for
the
information
of
the
court.
mr.
constangy
has
greater
familiarity
than
i
do
with
that
subject
since
he
represents
the
company
locally.
my
understanding
is
that
for
a
while
after
the
exploration,
there
was
no
agreement
then
there
was
a
strike.
ultimately,
the
strike
was
settled
and
sometime
later
in
1955,
the
agreement
was
reinstated
with
some
changes,
but
nonmaterial
to
the
work
assignment
and
workload
clause
and
that
there
was
a
provision
in
the
settlement
agreement
that
provided
that
these
particular
grievances,
which
were
then
pending
in
court,
would
be
determined
with
respect
to
arbitrality
--
arbitrability
by
the
decision
of
the
court.
they
were
preserved
in
that
manner.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
there
are
--
in
the
--
the
grievances
were
filed.
the
record
shows,
by
the
grievance
committee
in
the
plant.
they're
related
to
jobs.
however,
there
were
people
on
the
jobs
and
four
of
the
10
grievances
asked
for
compensation.
in
the
event,
the
grievance
was
adjusted
in
accordance
with
the
union's
demand.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
for
--
yes,
that
is
right.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
not
entirely
as
i
will
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
to
the
extent
that
back
pay
was
asked,
yes.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
not
entirely
for
reasons
that
i
will
like
to
cover
after.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
for
--
in
part.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
not
entirely.
yes.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
they
asked
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
all
the
grievances
asked
for
adjustment
a
and
i
should
also
add
to
the
court,
that
as
i
read
the
contract,
the
arbitrator
is
going
to
award
back
pay
if
appropriate
at
all
of
the
cases.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
only
if
--
only
if
arbitration
was
ordered
by
the
court.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
right.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
is
right,
your
honor.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
there
would
--
there
will
be
two
consequences
or
perhaps
three.
one
is
that
in
the
work
assignment
cases
and
in
the
workload
cases,
there
would
be
an
adjudication,
for
example,
if
the
workload
was
too
great.
this
might
--
this
might
lead
to
a
loss
of
job
or
it
might
lead
to
a
discontinue
of
the
practice
of
putting
these
additional
burdens
on
the
working
force.
and
the
second
consequence
is
that
there
might
be
some
compensation
in
all.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
is
correct.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
is
correct
and
beyond
that,
working
conditions,
which
might
cover
the
people
not
now
on
the
job,
might
be
effective,
since
this
is
related
not
to
the
individual
worker
but
to
the
type
of
work
being
done
--
done
on
the
job.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
will
deal
with
that
later.
now,
after
the
company
refused
to
submit
the
controversy
to
arbitration,
the
union
brought
a
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
alabama,
eastern
--
northeastern
division,
citing
jurisdiction
under
section
301
(a)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
based
upon
the
violation
of
a
contract
to
arbitrate
and
seeking
specific
performance
of
the
contract
and
in
addition,
damages.
now,
the
company
conceded
and
there
is
no
argument
about
these
essential
facts
and
defended
on
two
basic
rounds.
one,
the
court
was
without
jurisdiction
to
grant
the
relief
requested,
and
the
second
was
that
the
contract
had
expired
and
hence,
the
agreement
to
arbitrate
could
no
longer
be
enforced.
these
were
the
two
defenses.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
--
i
think
the
defense
is
both,
although,
stated
in
terms
of
no
jurisdiction
to
proceed.
but
i
think
as
counsel
has
developed
his
argument
in
his
brief,
it
is
both,
and
i
shall
deal
with
both
aspects
later.
the
district
court
judge
grooms,
on
april
29th,
1955,
issued
the
findings
of
fact
then
inclusions
of
law.
the
court
concluded
it
had
jurisdiction
and
that
the
union
had
a
right
to
maintain
an
action
to
compel
arbitration
by
virtue
of
section
301
(a)
of
the
labor
management
relations
act.
the
expiration
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
district
judge
held
and
found
he
did
not
relieve
the
company
of
its
obligation
to
arbitrate,
particularly
in
the
view
of
the
district
judge
because
of
the
fact
that
the
grievances
were
in
fact
processed
in
the
grievance
machinery
after
the
expiration
of
the
agreement.
you
will
remember,
i
said,
that
the
third
step
and
the
final
decision
in
the
third
step
was
in
july
after
the
contract
had
expired.
the
court
awarded
no
damages,
finding
that
the
union
had
not
proved
any
damage.
an
appeal
to
the
fifth
circuit,
the
court
of
appeals,
reversed
by
a
two-to-one
decision,
the
opinion
of
the
majority
was
delivered
by
judge
jones
and
the
dissent
by
judge
brown.
now,
all
of
the
judges
agreed
that
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
of
the
suit
under
301
(a).
they
also
expressly
agreed
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
did
not
prevent
the
issuance
of
the
order,
which
had
been
granted
by
the
district
court.
the
majority
held
that
in
the
suit
brought
under
section
301,
however,
an
executory
agreement
to
submit
disputes
to
arbitrations
would
not
be
specifically
enforced
in
the
absence
of
a
showing
that
such
agreements
were
enforceable
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
alabama.
i
might
say
that
we
concede
that
an
agreement
to
arbitrate
future
disputes
is
not
enforceable
as
we
read
the
law
of
alabama.
apparently
as
i
also
read
it,
but
i
do
not
profess
to
be
by
any
means
an
alabama
lawyer,
an
agreement
to
arbitrate
an
existing
dispute
is
enforceable
in
alabama.
in
reaching
this
concusion,
the
majority
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
pardon?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
it
was
an
existing
dispute.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
the
trouble
i
think
is
that
they
--
the
agreement
itself
related
to
future
disputes
and
i
think
that
because
the
agreement
was
entered
into
before
the
disputes
arose.
and
as
i
read
--
as
i
read
the
decisions
of
the
court,
they
were
acting
upon
the
labor
agreement
as
it
read.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that's
as
i
understand
the
alabama
law.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
would
think
so.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
i
accept
their
interpretation
as
i
must
of
alabama
law.
in
reaching
the
conclusion,
the
court
of
appeals
first
conclude
that
the
united
states
arbitration
act
doesn't
authorize
enforcement
of
arbitration
provisions
in
collective
bargaining
contracts,
and
i
will
deal
with
that
problem
subsequently.
it
then
proceeded
to
consider
whether
section
301
(a)
itself
could
be
provided
as
the
basis
upon
which
such
agreements
could
be
enforced.
in
reading
this
court's
opinion
in
westinghouse,
the
majority
concluded
that
section
301
(a)
created
neither
substantive
right
nor
remedy
and
finding
neither
a
federal
common
law
nor
a
remedy
authorized
under
alabama
law
for
specific
enforcement
of
agreements
to
arbitrate,
the
court
concluded
that
there
was
no
basis
upon
which
it
could
grant
relief
in
this
case.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
they
say
they
had
jurisdiction
to
entertain
the
cause,
but
they
have
no
jurisdiction
to
entertain
this
particular
case.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
jurisdiction
to
make
--
to
make
the
overall
decision
as
to
whether
this
case
applies.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
certainly,
yes.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
which
i
will.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
this
is
not
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
this
is
not
a
case
of
commerce
within
the
several
--
in
the
several
states.
this
is
a
case
of
commerce
affecting
commerce.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
there
are
two
--
there
are
two
sections
involved.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
pardon.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
will
deal
with
that
and
there
are
two
--
two
sections
of
the
act
involved.
one
in
my
opinion
deals
with
commerce
between
the
several
states
and
the
other
is
so
worded
that
it
encompasses
commerce
affecting
an
industry,
affecting
commerce.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
and
i
want
to,
in
a
little
while
give
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
you
a
rundown
of
the
opinions
in
the
various
circuits
on
this
point
which
is
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
which
is
very
right.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that's
involved
very
much
in
this
case.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
don't
know.
it
seems
we
were
--
as
i
--
as
i
list
the
questions
in
a
few
minutes,
we
will
see
we
have
a
multiplicity
of
important
questions.
judge
brown
dissented
and
in
his
dissent,
he
drew
his
right
and
what
he
thought
the
court
should
have
done
from
section
301
(a)
saying
that
construing
that
section
in
light
of
what
congress
in
his
opinion
intended
to
do,
that
this
independently
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
authorized
the
enforcement
of
this
agreement
by
application
of
the
union
to
grant
relief.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
do.
i
take
that
but
i
also
say
that
if
i
am
not
well-founded,
and
i
think
i
am,
in
that
situation,
we
also
buttress
our
claim
through
relief
on
the
arbitration
act.
we
have
a
double-barrel
approach
in
that
respect.
the
certiorari
was
sought
and
granted
because
of
the
square
conflict
between
the
decisions
of
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit,
which
are
here
before
you.
i
might
say
and
i
won't
intrude
upon
the
first
circuit
--
the
circuit
decisions,
but
in
the
first
circuit
cases,
the
court
speaking
through
chief
judge
magruder,
held
--
held
in
his
opinion
that
while
there
was
no
authority
to
compel
arbitration
by
virtue
of
the
provisions
of
section
301
alone,
such
authority
could
be
found
under
the
terms
of
the
united
states
arbitration
act.
now,
there
are
--
as
i
read
it,
there
are
four
questions
involved,
common
to
all
three
cases.
there
are
a
few
questions
involved
of
particular
interest
to
one
case
or
another.
and
the
questions
involved
are
these,
which
this
court
indicated
in
granting
certiorari
in
the
goodall
case
which
is
next
and
then
the
general
electric
case.
whether
section
301
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
of
1957
granted
to
the
district
courts
of
the
united
states
jurisdiction
where
no
other
ground
for
federal
jurisdiction
is
alleged
or
claimed.
two,
whether
section
301
(a)
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
of
1947
granted
to
the
district
court
of
the
united
states
equitable
jurisdiction
to
compel
specific
performance
of
arbitration
clauses
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
or
was
limited
to
damage
or
law
of
jurisdiction.
three,
whether
the
district
court
has
jurisdiction
to
decree
specific
performance
of
an
agreement
to
arbitrate
such
a
dispute
despite
the
prohibitions
of
the
norris-la
guardia
act.
four,
whether
the
united
states
arbitration
act
is
applicable
to
the
agreement
to
arbitrate
in
a
collective
agreement
or
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
i
use
the
terms
synonymously.
now,
five,
which
is
peculiar
to
this
case
and
perhaps
the
goodall
case,
but
as
i
understand
counsel
in
the
general
electric
case
not
to
that
case,
although,
the
statement
appears
in
our
brief
which
is
erroneous
in
light
of
the
statement
to
me
this
morning,
whether
there
is
a
duty
to
arbitrate
approved
grievances
after
the
agreement
on
which
they
are
based
has
expired.
as
i
understand
in
general
electric,
the
--
the
agreement
has
not
expired.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
will
--
i
will
deal
with
that
under
the
first
aspect
of
the
--
of
the
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
is
a
subordinate
question.
i
have
not,
your
honors,
attempted
to
--
to
outline
all
of
the
subordinate
questions
involved,
but
there
are
many
subordinate
questions.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
that
--
that
fits
under
the
first
discussion
of
301,
whether
state
or
federal
law
is
applicable
and
what
affect
that
has
upon
the
--
the
case.
now,
under
301
--
before
i
do
that,
i
would
like
to
take
advantage
of
a
brief
chart
to
indicate
where
we
stay
under
this
area
throughout
the
country.
this
is
a
much
litigated
and
much
difficult
area
as
it
occurred
from
the
following.
almost,
in
fact,
i
think
every
circuit
with
the
exception
of
an
opinion
in
one
circuit
by
two
judges
where
the
opinion
is
the
other
way
in
this
case,
all
the
circuits
first,
second,
third,
fourth,
fifth,
sixth
and
seventh,
not
all,
but
those
circuits,
assumed
that
there
is
jurisdiction
under
301
to
bring
a
suit.
this
again,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
leads
to
your
question
for
what
purpose,
but
then
i
will
have
to
develop.
now,
with
request
--
with
respect
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
courts
of
appeal.
these
are
courts
of
appeal,
although,
one
in
the
fourth
circuit
is
--
is
not
quite
clear,
but
it
seems
to
give
favorable
inference
to
a
district
decision
to
this
effect
by
commenting
favorably
about
it
in
the
case
which
we
cite
in
our
brief.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
it
has,
but
i
think
i've
tried
to
round
it
out
as
to
how
i
interpret
these
other
opinions.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that's
very
difficult.
i'll
try
to
find
what
i
think
now
is
the
prevailing
trend.
the
question
of
whether
equitable
relief
may
be
afforded
in
301
as
against
limiting
it
to
damage
relief
or
law
relief
is
decided,
yes,
in
the
first
circuit.
it's
not
spoken
about
in
the
second.
it's
decided,
yes,
in
the
third.
yes,
in
the
fourth
in
his
way
of
indicating
approval
for
a
lower
court's
judgment.
yes,
in
the
fifth,
except
this
is
the
case
where
two
judges,
not
on
the
panel
in
this
case,
seemed
to
indicate
that
their
reading
of
westinghouse
deprives
them
of
--
of
authority
to
say
that
equitable
relief
may
be
granted.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
some
are
pre.
some
have
come
down
since.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
sixth
circuit,
the
answer
is
yes.
in
the
seventh
circuit,
the
answer
is
yes.
the
seventh
circuit,
for
example,
they
had
a
recent
case
just
handed
down
and
we
mentioned
that
in
one
of
the
reply
briefs.
now,
the
question
of
whether
an
norris-laguardia
act
is
a
bar,
is
a
bar,
is
no
bar
as
was
held
here.
it's
not
a
bar.
the
first
circuit
says
it
is
not
a
bar.
the
third
circuit
says
this
is
not
a
bar.
the
fourth
circuit
says
this
is
not
a
bar.
fifth
circuit
says
it's
not
a
bar.
the
sixth
circuit
says
it
is
not
a
bar
and
the
seventh
circuit
says
this
is
not
a
bar.
now,
under
the
arbitration
act
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
think
that's
absolutely
correct.
i
am
just
doing
this
to
furnish
a
background
of
our
problem,
which
is
very
far
reaching.
in
construing
the
arbitration
act,
the
--
they
--
there
are
two
essential
problems.
one
is
as
to
whether
the
collective
agreement
is
excluded
as
a
contract
of
employment
under
a
--
an
exemption
in
the
statute.
and
there,
the
first
circuit
says
it
is
not
excluded
as
a
contract
of
employment.
now,
what
the
congress
meant
was
an
individual
contract
of
employment,
not
a
collective
agreement.
that
is
judge
magruder's
opinion
in
the
g.e.
case.
the
--
the
second
circuit
says
it
is
--
the
second
circuit
on
that
point
says
no.
third
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
now,
maybe
i
misread
this.
i
want
to
go
back
because
i
--
implicit
in
your
question.
the
--
the
yes
or
no
should
relate
to
this
formulation,
not
excluded
as
a
contract
of
employment.
and
the
answer
to
the
first
circuit
is,
yes,
it
is
not
excluded
as
a
contract
of
employment.
and
as
i
read
the
second
circuit
in
single
step,
their
answer
would
be
no.
in
the
third
circuit,
it
would
be
no,
in
the
fourth
circuit,
no,
in
lincoln
mills,
no,
in
the
--
in
the
sixth
circuit,
yes,
and
in
the
seventh
circuit,
no.
now,
on
the
exclusion
limited
to
workers
in
commerce.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
this
is
another
--
another
thing.
i
want
to
move
along.
there
is
a
difference
between
three
of
the
circuits
or
one
way
to
the
other
and
relief
under
301,
which
is
the
first
point
i
argue
here.
the
first
circuit
says,
“there
is
no
relief
under
301,
although,
there
is
jurisdiction
under
301.”
the
fourth
circuit,
“there
is
a
relief
under
301.”
fifth
circuit
says,
“there
is
no
relief
under
301.”
and
the
seventh
circuit
says,
“in
this
recent
case,
there
is
no
relief
under
301.”
now,
i
want
to
move
quickly
now
to
the
legal
issues
involved
and
only
mention
one
other
fact
which
may
be
of
great
interest
to
you,
and
that
is
the
importance
beyond
the
question
of
the
conflicts
in
these
circuits
on
these
various
points,
the
whole
importance
to
the
public,
to
the
labor
movement,
to
employers
of
the
--
and
the
prevalence
of
this
type
of
arbitration
contracts.
the
recent
studies
by
the
bureau
of
labor
statistics
and
other
government
agencies
and
private
agencies
like
the
bna,
which
have
circulated
and
they
examined
many
contracts,
seems
to
be
that
90%
of
contracts
today
contained
provisions
for
arbitration
of
grievances.
now,
i
think
we
--
we
ought
to
distinguish
since
i'll
have
to
make
reference
to
it
a
little
later
on
the
question
of
contract
arbitrations
and
grievance
arbitrations.
a
contract
arbitration
is
an
arbitration
where
the
parties
agree
that
upon
termination
of
the
agreement,
they
will
arbitrate
the
terms
of
a
new
agreement.
that's
called
contract
arbitration.
historically,
that
was
what
we
thought
we
were
talking
about
25
years
ago,
by
in
large,
when
we
dealt
with
arbitrations.
we
go
back
50
years
when
we
talked
about
arbitrations.
we
probably
meant
mediation
and
conciliation.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
labor
--
i'm
talking
about
labor
agreements,
collective
agreements
or
collective
bargaining
agreements.grievance
arbitration
is
an
arbitration
arising
under
the
contract
and
in
interpretation
of
the
contract.
so,
we
can
see
the
wide
importance
of
this
question
to
the
business
and
labor
community.
now,
the
issue
--
i
would
like
first
to
deal
with
the
question
of
jurisdiction
and
301.
the
issue
tendered
here
is
whether
301
is
to
be
interpreted
as
a
grant
of
federal
jurisdiction
in
a
case
such
as
like
this
such
as
this
and
in
related
cases.
now,
this
court
dealt
not
with
this
problem.
i
hasten
to
add
the
arbitrability
of
a
clause
running
to
the
union
and
not
to
an
individual
employee.
and
by
the
way,
i
should
mention
that
the
record
shows
that
the
right
to
arbitrate
in
this
labor
agreement
is
reserved
to
the
union
and
the
company
and
is
not
a
right
of
the
individual
employees.
now,
the
initial
objection
to
the
assertion
of
jurisdiction,
which
is
always
made
now
since
westinghouse
is
westinghouse.
i
do
not
read
westinghouse
as
controlling
the
decision
in
this
case.
i
read
westinghouse
in
all
of
the
opinions
that
were
rendered
as
asserting
that
the
right
of
an
employee
to
recover
wages
due
is
a
right
which
was
not
encompassed
within
the
grant
made
in
301
for
unions
and
employers
to
sue
each
other.
i
do
not
believe
that
any
reading
in
the
case
leads
to
any
conclusion
that
anything
beyond
that
was
decided
in
westinghouse.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
no,
but
there
was
suit
by
union
and
it
was
held
there
was
no
jurisdiction
under
301
because
the
union
was
seeking
to
assert
a
right,
personal
to
the
employee.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
there
was
a
suit.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
is
correct.
it
was
held
there
that
that
was
not
its
right
and
therefore,
west
--
and
therefore,
301
did
not
encompass
the
type
of
situation
there
before
the
court.
of
new
impression
is
the
question
here
which
can
be
faced
on
its
merits
and
that
is
does
it
encompass
a
right
which
clearly
is
in
the
union
here
to
arbitrate
with
the
employer.
now,
here
there
are
--
i
think
we
ought
to
turn
to
301
because
there
are
several
arguments
made
which
questioned
this
right,
which
i
shall
talk
about
in
a
minute.
section
301
(a)
is
not
limited
in
its
terms.
it
provides
--
section
301
of
the
labor
relations
act,
it
provides
that
suits
for
violations
of
contracts
between
an
employer
and
a
labor
organization
representing
employees
in
an
industry
affecting
commerce
as
defined
in
this
act
or
between
any
such
labor
organizations
may
be
brought
in
any
district
court
of
the
united
states
having
jurisdiction
of
the
parties
without
regard
to
the
amount
of
controversy
or
without
regard
to
the
citizenship
of
the
parties.
now,
there
are
several
objections
raised
with
respect
to
the
applicability
of
that
section
and
there
is
a
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
when
we
recessed
for
lunch,
i
was
dealing
with
the
question
of
section
301.
now,
i
must
say
in
all
candor
that
the
congressional
history
with
respect
to
this
subject
is
very,
very
confusing
indeed.congress
was
dealing
in
this
area
largely
with
the
objections
that
had
been
made
that
unions
cannot
be
sued.
however,
in
formulating
the
legislation
which
probably
in
this
instance
is
the
most
reliable
guide
it
was
not
confined
to
suits
against
unions
for
damages
which
is
the
subject
most
discussed.
it
was
as
the
statute
itself
plainly
indicates,
a
statute
governing
suits
by
one
against
the
other
be
irrespective
of
whether
the
plaintiff
was
union
or
defendant.
and
in
fact,
there
are
community
reports
in
reporting
this
legislation
which
indicate
that
very
clearly.
and
it
would
be
hard
to
believe
that
congress
in
enacting
a
statute
of
this
type
would
confine
itself
to
a
--
a
piece
of
legislation
that
would
operate
only
on
one
side
of
the
street.
and
i
must
conclude
from
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
they
operate
on
the
other
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
they
need
a
legislation
to
bring
the
cases
in
the
federal
court.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
correct.
they
could
be
sued.
but,
of
course,
they
could
not
necessarily
be
sued
in
the
federal
court.
then
it
would
depend
upon
other
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
except
the
language
that
the
congress
used
in
their
committee
reports
does
shed
some
light
that
there
was
a
mutuality
of
approach
with
respect
to
bringing
both
people
into
the
federal
court
and
subjecting
them
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
--
the
focus
of
the
debate,
i
will
agree,
related
to
the
suability
of
unions.
but
on
the
other
hand,
the
reports
made
by
the
congressional
committees
and
what
we
must
assume
--
and
i
think
quite
properly,
is
their
instinct
to
fairness
would
be
to
subject
them
to
sue
in
the
same
form.
this
is
the
conclusion
that
i
must
come
to
reading
the
reports
of
the
committee
relating
to
this
particular
subject.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
it
does
not.
it
return
--
it
is
in
terms
of
suits
but
what
does
shed
light
on
this
particular
subject
is
the
whole
framework
of
the
labor
relations
policy
of
the
united
states,
because
it
is
often
forgotten,
and
we
lawyers,
perhaps
more
than
others,
are
guilty
of
this
omission.
section
301
was
part
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
and
is
a
provision
of
the
act
designed
to
implement
the
basic
philosophy
of
the
statute.
and
the
basic
philosophy
of
the
statute
is
that
it
contributes
to
industrial
stability
to
have
collective
bargaining.
and
as
the
labor
board
has
held
and
as
the
courts
have
held,
the
ultimate
outcome
of
constructive
collective-bargaining
is
a
labor
contract,
and
it
contributes
to
industrial
fees
to
have
labor
contracts
that
are
enforced
it.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
correct.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
would
they
--
i
believe
they
could.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
i
believe
they
could
under
the
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
under
the
grant
of
jurisdiction
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
it
is
to
carry
out
the
plain
language
of
the
congress
in
this
respect.
i
cannot
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
that
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
--
i
will
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
they
--
they're
a
little
more
impoverished
so
i
don't
know
whether
they
can
reach
to
that
particular
point.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
under
the
language
of
301,
i
think
this
is
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
will.
now,
the
--
the
--
when
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute,
and
as
i
have
done
it
and
this
court
has
done
it
in
westinghouse.
what
we
find
here
is
that
there
was
a
committee
report
in
reference
to
the
question
of
--
of
the
problems
that
confronted
the
congress
in
relation
to
labor
unions.
and
the
obvious
problem
which
congress
focused
on
was
the
question
of
the
rules
in
the
various
states
relating
to
the
non-suability
of
unions.
and
that
operated
a
great
amount
of
the
time
of
congress
in
dealing
with
this
subject.
but
nevertheless,
when
we
dealt
with
the
--
the
language
of
the
statute,
the
language
of
the
statute
relates
to
the
question
of
making
contracts
between
employers
and
collective
bargaining
agents
enforcing
it.
i
don't
think
congress
for
a
moment
thought
of
the
situation
which
your
honor
is
familiar
with,
the
amalgamated
situation.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
--
i
--
that
is
correct,
just
as
they
did
not
think
of
specific
performance.
they
however,
thought
of
the
question
of
the
enforceability
of
agreements
between
the
employers
and
the
employees.
and
to
that
they
addressed
themselves.
now,
it
is
argued
by
almost
all
of
the
companies
here
that
the
decision
in
this
case
must
be
governed
by
the
decision
of
the
court
in
bernhardt
versus
polygraphic
co.,
one
of
the
recent
pronouncements
of
the
court
which
--
which
held
that
in
with
respect
to
an
individual
contract
of
discharge
in
a
case
in
which
no
allegation
was
made
that
the
industry
involved
affected
commerce.
that
recourse
would
be
made
to
state
law
as
to
the
enforceability
of
agreements
to
arbitrate.
now,
that
case
was
a
diversity
case.
and
as
i
read
that
case,
the
sole
focus
of
the
decision
is
that
in
the
diversity
case
the
state
rule
on
the
subject
so
substantially
affects
the
cause
of
action
that
under
guaranty
trust
versus
york,
that
should
it
be
sent
to
state
law.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
301
was
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
no,
301
was
not
involved
in
that
particular
case.
and
no
sustenance
was
drawn
either
from
301
or
from
the
enactments
of
congress
relating
to
the
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
court
didn't
talk
about
it.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
they're
--
they
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that's
correct.
.but
there
they
invoked
jurisdiction
under
the
diversity
clause.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
because
of
adversity
no,
it
does
not
cut
down
the
jurisdiction
under
301
and
we
buttress
our
argument
upon
301.
but
i
want
to
point
out
that
in
the
bernhardt
case
that
it
was
specifically
pointed
out
that
the
--
that
the
united
states
arbitration
act
did
not
apply
because
of
lack
of
allegations
with
respect
to
commerce
within
the
meaning
of
the
american
arbitration
act
that
i'm
going
to
discuss
at
a
subsequent
point
in
the
argument.
that
was
expressly
excluded
by
mr.
justice
douglas
who
wrote
the
opinion
in
that
case
from
the
impact
of
the
decision.
what
we
had
there
was
a
straight
contract
of
employment,
no
allegation
of
commerce;
diversity
of
citizenship,
the
court
sent
them
to
the
law
of
vermont
in
that
particular
case.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
new
york.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
federal
law
would
govern
assuming
that
it
fits
within
the
scope
of
301
and
assuming
that
the
statute
would
be
defined
as
going
beyond
the
section
which
it
can
literally
be
defined
of
which
says
301
(a)
suits
for
violation
of
contracts
between
an
employer
and
a
labor
organization
representing
the
employees
in
an
industry
affecting
commerce
as
defined
in
the
act
maybe
brought.
now
the
real
question
upon
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
go
a
little
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
yes,
i
go
a
little
beyond
that
too,
your
honor.
and
this
is
a
subject
which
i
am
not
at
the
moment
prepared
to
make
but
is
certainly
a
subject
to
the
clause
that
the
suits
that
they
may
be
talking
about
are
labor
relations
disputes.
the
statute
itself
does
not
say
it.
the
statute
literally
read
only
talks
about
suits
between
an
employer,
suits
for
violation
of
contracts
between
the
employer
and
the
labor
organization
representing
employees
in
an
industry
affecting
commerce
as
defined
in
this
act.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
no,
i
don't
think
it
can
be
asked
in
light
of
the
reading
of
the
statute,
although,
that
might
be
an
interpretation
as
part
of
a
labor
relations
statute.
now,
in
--
in
conjunction
with
the
force
and
reach
of
section
301,
we
have
this
obvious
thing
which
i
think
focuses
the
problem
with
respect
to
the
reach
of
section
301.
and
that
is
this.
it
is
obvious
and
without
question
in
the
light
of
the
legislative
history
that
congress
intended
that
irrespective
of
state
law,
that
a
union
could
be
sued
in
damages
in
the
federal
courts
under
301.
and
it
is
my
position
in
this
case
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
i
think
that's
quite
obvious
and
i
think
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
because
of
the
entire
legislative
history
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
relating
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
read
it,
too.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
no,
it
is
not
but
it
is
--
it
is
i
think,
your
honor
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
say
that
(voice
overlap)
--
for
violation
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
no,
i
say
suits
--
i'm
following
the
language
of
the
statute.
i
say
suits
for
a
violation
of
contracts
between
an
employer
and
a
labor
organization
representing
employees.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
think
--
i
think
your
honor,
that
the
statute
literally
read
can
lead
to
this
conclusion.
i
think
we
are
considering
a
labor
relations
statute
and
i
would
answer
that
by
saying
that
independently
of
the
result
that
you
might
reach
in
this
case,
there's
no
doubt
that
the
intention
of
congress
was
that
it
could
reach
a
collective
agreement.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
do.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
--
may
i
repeat
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(voice
overlap)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
substantive
basis,
your
honor,
when
we
get
into
a
case
such
as
this
perhaps
ought
to
be
better
met
in
the
case
itself.
i
say
the
statute
--
i
want
to
repeat
what
i
said.
perhaps
i
did
not
articulate
it
as
clearly
as
i
should.
i
said
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
301
related
to
a
collective-bargaining
agreement.
i
don't
think
in
your
honor's
mind
there's
any
doubt
about
that.
now
whether
--
perhaps
this
is
a
second
thought
as
i
ponder
the
significance
of
your
question,
whether
it
reaches
any
other
contract
behind
the
collective
--
beyond
the
collective
bargaining
contract,
i
don't
know.
the
statute
literally
reads
that
way.
it
says
any
suit.
it
is
however,
part
of
a
labor
relations
statute
and
could
be
appropriately
construed
to
be
confined
to
a
collective
agreement.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
contracts
of
employment.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
not
a
--
not
a
labor
agreement.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
no.
no
collective
bargaining
agreement.
now,
maybe
i
--
maybe
i
reached
too
far,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
contracts
of
employment.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
would
like
to
talk
about
that
under
the
arbitration.
but
i
am
saying
now,
perhaps
i
spoke
too
broadly
before.
and
i
am
in
thinking
of
a
literal
language
of
statute,
i
say
now
that
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
it
reaches
a
collective
agreement.
and
that
was
what
congress
was
dealing
with.
and
when
i
read
the
legislative
history
which
is
quoted
in
the
brief
and
which
time
will
not
me
--
permit
me
to
go
over,
i
--
i
read
it
to
vest
in
the
federal
court's
jurisdiction
over
collective
agreements
and
suits
brought
by
an
employer
or
brought
by
a
union.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
and
i
--
i
say
that
it
provides
enough
substantive
law
in
this
area
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
because
a
--
because
the
court
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
because
a
court
unfortunately
must
shape
doctrine
from
the
policy
declarations
of
the
congress
and
there
have
been
a
number
of
policy
declarations
in
the
enactments
of
congress
as
well
as
the
legislative
history
to
warrant
the
creation
of
the
body
of
federal
law
from
that
material
which
will
govern
this
particular
situation.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
no.
no,
i
don't
think
that
will
be
required
because
as
i
pointed
out
earlier,
not
only
for
information
but
for
the
impact
upon
the
federal
courts,
90%
of
our
contracts
today
contain
provisions
for
arbitration.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i'm
talking
about
301.
then
if
you
invoke
the
jurisdiction
under
301
to
enforce
the
obligation
of
an
employer
to
arbitrate
the
arbitrator
and
not
the
courts,
will
be
vested
with
the
responsibility
of
deciding
that
particular
aspect.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
no,
the
--
no,
your
honor.
the
arbitrator
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
the
arbitrator
will
decide
that.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
there
are
--
there
are
reviews
between
very
narrow
limits.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
no,
no,
i
would
not
say
that.
we
might
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
no,
it
might
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
there
are
some
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
there
are
some
cases
of
that
category
but
in
my
own
experience
from
which
i'm
limited
to
talk,
i
have
represented
some
very
large
unions
in
addition
to
this
one
and
in
some
of
them
through
a
whole
structure
of
arbitration,
not
one
case
has
landed
in
any
court.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
there
are
some
cases.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
there
are
some
cases.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
the
--
what
you
--
what
you
envisage,
and
that
is
the
federal
courts
operating
in
the
realm
of
a
whole
area
of
adjudication.
i
do
not
envisage
because
of
the
experience
that
we
have
had
under
arbitration
clause.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
think
the
general
--
i
think
the
general
--
whatever
cases
are
envisaged
are
envisaged
in
light
of
the
declaration
by
the
congress,
not
only
in
the
--
in
the
labor
management
relations
act,
but
dating
back
to
the
norris-laguardia
act
and
other
acts
vindicating
a
federal
policy
to
encourage
voluntary
arbitration.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
--
but,
your
honor,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
procedure
we
invoke
here
will
not
bring
that
into
the
courts,
whereas,
a
contrary
procedure
would
bring
it
into
the
courts.
the
procedure
we
are
invoking
is
a
procedure
directed
at
securing
relief
to
arbitrate,
not
relief
to
bring
into
the
federal
court,
the
adjudication
of
these
claims.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
i
--
and
your
honor,
and
i
must
put
it
to
you
that
on
the
basis
of
experience,
not
hypothesis,
this
is
not
the
case.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
no.
no,
i
have
not
represented
only
one.
my
point
is
that
in
the
overwhelming
thousands
upon
thousands
of
grievance
arbitrations
are
heard
every
year
and
the
experience
proves
that
if
you
have
an
arbitration
process
to
operate
and
the
courts
support
that
process,
those
cases
will
be
decided
by
the
arbitrator
and
they
will
not
be
decided
by
the
courts
except
in
a
very
limited
range.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
would
say
overwhelmingly.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
so
--
so
did
the
criminal
laws
of
the
country.
but
that
has
never
been
a
basis
for
declining
to
exercise
criminal
jurisdiction
against
the
offender.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
i
think
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
i
think
that's
what
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
source
in
my
opinion
is
the
national
labor
relations
act,
norris-laguardia
act,
the
federal
mediation
act,
all
of
which
have
expressed
the
policy
of
the
united
states
in
industries
affecting
commerce
to
encourage
collective-bargaining
and
after
all
arbitration
is
part
and
parcel
of
collective-bargaining
and
to
--
to
--
and
that
in
my
opinion
provides
the
support
for
this
particularly
in
light
of
the
manifest
desire
of
the
congress,
as
expressed,
is
to
carry
out
their
policy
in
the
amendments
they
made
in
1947.
i
would
like
to
--
i
think
that
i
--
i
and
perhaps
i
want
to
say
one
word
about
that
and
then
go
on
to
some
other
points.
and
that
is
this.
had
congress
spelled
out,
which
is
what
i
think
you
would
and
i
would
like,
that
congress
spelled
out
the
--
that's
the
--
all
of
the
variations
of
this
--
in
minutiae.
i
don't
think
any
of
us
would
have
been
troubled
because
the
congress
clause
is
the
basis
upon
which
congress
could
act.
if
they
acted
to
create
a
national
labor
relations
act
to
prevent
obstructions
in
commerce,
which
act
contemplates
contracts
and
encourages
the
--
the
institution
in
contracts
of
arbitration,
voluntary
arbitration
proceedings,
then
i
say
that
that
provides
the
basis
--
federal
basis
for
acting
in
this
effort.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that's
correct.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
the
reason
they
--
and
the
reason,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
reason
they
refused
to
do
that
was
that
in
the
same
law
they
had
a
provision
for
resort
to
courts
to
do
the
--
precisely
the
same
thing
and
the
--
the
congressional
history
which
we
quote
in
our
brief
extensively
said
they
made
a
choice
to
permit
the
courts
to
do
it
and
not
the
labor
board.
and
regardless
of
the
merits
of
that,
that
seems
quite
clear
in
the
congressional
record.
i
would
like
to
turn,
if
i
may,
to
the
question
of
--
pass
very
briefly
over
it
because
i
think
this
court
has
expressed
itself
several
times
on
the
subject
and
--
and
that's
the
question
of
the
–
the
--
well,
before
i
do
that,
i
want
to
say
just
a
sentence
because
the
limitations
of
time
on
a
collateral
question
that's
been
raised
and
that
is
do
we
mean
in
301
that
only
equitable
--
that
only
damage
suit
liability
can
be
granted?
i
say,
no.
the
statute
doesn't
say
no.
we
find
while
they
focus
on
damage
suits,
we
find
no
expression
in
the
statute
on
that
and
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
equity
relief
was
not
contemplated
by
the
statute.
i
want
to
turn
now
to
the
question
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
despite
differences
on
all
of
the
other
questions
that
we
have
a
numbering.
all
of
the
circuits
that
have
dealt
with
the
problem
have
held
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
does
not
follow
equitable
relief
to
convey
an
employer
to
comply
with
the
terms
on
the
collective-bargaining
agreement.
i
would
refer,
your
honors,
to
the
discussion
of
judge
magruder,
chief
judge
magruder,
on
that
subject
in
the
general
electric
case
and
to
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
several
cases
where
relief
has
been
granted
notwithstanding,
the
provisions
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
i
already
gave
a
short-hand
statement
of
why
the
norris-laguardia
act
does
not
apply.
it
does
not
apply
because
it
was
never
the
purpose
or
intention
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
to
deal
with
a
situation
of
this
type.
norris-laguardia
act
in
section
4
deals
with
certain
type
of
activities
such
as
peaceful
picketing,
strikes,
et
cetera.
section
7
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
lays
down
certain
procedural
requirements.
the
procedural
requirements
are
just
in
apposite
to
a
case
of
this
character.
as
justice
jackson
said
in
the
case
similar,
it
says
to
hold
the
norris-laguardia
act
apply
to
this
particular
situation
would
be
to
drive
the
knife
inward.
there
are
other
problems,
the
united
states
arbitration
act,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
my
colleague,
mr.
feller,
will
be
in
a
position
to
discuss
that
in
the
goodall
case
when
he
argues
it.
i
thank
you
very
much
for
this
opportunity.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
first
of
all,
i
have
meant
earlier
to
tell
the
court
that
the
first
time
i
learned
about
the
plant
closing
down
was
at
lunch
today.
i
wasn't
aware
of
that.
and
i
made
a
note
of
it
but
i
didn't
reach
it.
i
don't
think
the
case
is
moot
because
of
several
considerations.
first
of
all,
this
workload
arbitration
must
be
arbitrated
in
order
to
determine
what
remains
and
that
is
the
liability
for
any
compensation
that
any
man
is
entitled
to
whose
grievance
was
denied
by
the
employer
during
that
period.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
--
well,
that
--
yes.
that
is
--
that
is
back
then.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
is
correct.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
westinghouse
did
not
involve
and
in
the
contract
in
westinghouse
did
not
contain
an
--
an
arbitration
provision.
it
contained
a
--
a
grievance
machinery
and
then
there
have
to
be
recourse
either
to
strike
or
to
bring
in
suit
to
enforce
individual
rights
under
the
contract.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
think
it
makes
--
i
think
it
makes
a
substantial
difference
because
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
method
--
no,
there's
a
legal
difference.
the
method
agreed
upon
by
the
parties
to
adjudicate
that
dispute
was
not
to
go
to
court.
the
method
agreed
upon
between
the
parties
to
adjudicate
that
dispute
was
to
go
to
an
arbitrator.
in
westinghouse,
that
was
not
so.
and
so,
the
--
as
was
said
in
the
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that's
correct.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
there
--
but
it
has
very
important
implications
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
polygraphic
case
as
to
how
you
adjudicate
this
arbitration
itself
running
through
the
union.
now,
there's
another
point.
if
we
cannot
arbitrate
this
dispute
and
since
the
union
is
the
only
way,
the
one
who
may
arbitrate
it
and
bring
it
up
to
this
channel,
there
is
a
great
doubt
about
the
right
of
an
individual
to
pursue
his
remedy
as
an
individual
because
there
have
been
cases
that
have
decided
that
where
an
arbitration
is
the
method
provided
in
the
agreement,
it
must
be
followed.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that's
correct.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
no,
but
i
think
that
the
fact
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
think
the
effect
of
the
federal
statute
is
to
create
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
that
jurisdiction
for
the
reasons
that
i
stated.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
think
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
there's
another
important
consideration,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
i
would
like
to
advance,
and
that
is
this
court
has
sustained
orders
by
the
board
where
an
employer
has
discontinued
requiring
action
to,
notwithstanding,
a
determination
and
that
is
because
that
this
has
a
prospective
operation,
we
don't
know.
we
have
heard,
of
course,
from
counsel.
i
have
known
in
my
own
experience
that
notwithstanding,
shutdowns
by
plants
and
even
sales
of
machinery,
they
operate
in
the
future.
we've
had
those
problems
with
orders
of
the
board,
labor
board,
which
have
been
specifically
enforced
notwithstanding,
the
shutdown
in
the
plant.
it
has
never
been
regarded
that
that
is
--
presents
a
moot
controversy.
and
so
here,
we
are
not
advised
and
we
ought
not
to
be
subjected
to
the
whim
of
the
employer
to
decide
what
the
prospect
of
operation
of
this
grievance
will
be.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
now,
i
don't
want
to
be
categoric
anymore
than
your
honors.
the
recollection
is
probably
as
good
as
mine.
but
as
i
recall
the
doctrine
of
law
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
those
types
of
orders
have
been
enforced,
specifically
enforced,
notwithstanding,
a
shutdown
of
a
plant.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
sir,
i
--
i
at
this
point
i'm
not
distinguishing
between
plants.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
i
--
i
think
we
would
want
to
call
your
attention
to
some
of
those
situations.
as
i
said,
i
was
not
aware
in
the
briefs
presented
that
this
problem
was
here
until
we
arrived
today.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
all
right,
sir.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
if
the
chief
justice
will
give
me
permission
to
do
that,
i
would
be
glad
to
do
it.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
am
not,
not
at
the
moment.
i
--
i
certainly
can
ascertain
the
facts.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
would
be
glad
to
--
i
would
be
glad
to
do
that.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
i
would
be
glad
to
do
that.
