mr.
frank
a.
constangy
if
the
court
please.
briefly,
there
are
two
or
three
practical
issues
as
to
the
present
posture
of
this
situation
that
i
would
like
to
mention
to
the
court
so
that
there
would
be
a
complete
understanding
of
where
we
are
as
of
this
moment.
the
--
this,
as
counsel
stated
in
his
opening
argument
is
beyond
the
record,
but
actually
what
happened
in
this
instance
was
that
the
contract
expired
in
july
3rd,
1954,
by
mutual
notices
of
the
parties.
there
was
no
contract
in
existence
thereafter
between
these
parties
until
sometime
in
january
or
february
1956.
in
the
meantime,
there
had
occurred
a
strike
which
began
in
august
of
1955
and
ran
until
january
of
1956.
at
the
time
the
strike
were
settled
and
a
new
contract
was
written,
i
think
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
there
were
material
changes
in
the
workload
clause.
there
was
an
express
provision
that
grievances
arising
under
the
previous
contracts
would
not
be
eligible
for
arbitration
under
the
new
contract
and
with
the
reservation
that
the
10
matters
involved
in
this
matter
which
were
then
pending
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
would
not
be
arbitrated
unless
the
circuit
court
ordered
them
arbitrated.
of
even
more
recent
vintage
in
the
last
few
weeks,
the
company
has
literally
ceased
to
operate.
it
has
sold
its
plant.
it
has
no
employees
at
all
and
is
not
actually
in
business.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
well,
in
good
many
aspects
it
seems
to
be
so.
the
corporation
has
not
been
dissolved,
but
the
--
insofar
as
an
operating
employer,
it
no
longer
exists.
it
has
no
employees
there.
it
has
no
machinery
and
no
point.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
no,
sir.
they
have
--
they
have
completely
gone
out
of
business
insofar
as
this
plant
is
concerned
and
so
--
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
no,
they've
sold
the
machinery
and
they've
independently
sold
the
building
to
a
group
of
citizens
who
will
lease
it
for
other
purposes.
and
we
have
had
no
employees
for
several
weeks.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
no,
sir.
and
they're
obvious
--
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
obviously,
it
is
not
because
it
is
being
--
the
premises
are
being
subdivided
into
series
of
--
a
series
of
small
units
for
small
manufacturing
operations.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
well,
we
have
involved,
this
counsel
pointed
out
conceivably
some
back
pay
to
some
individuals
for
a
work
performed
during
a
period
of
four
to
six
weeks
or
eight
weeks
--
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
--
prior
to
the
expiration
of
the
contract
and
we
think
that's
clearly
under
westinghouse.
it
clearly
is
covered
by
the
westinghouse
decision.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
yes,
sir.
there
can
be
no
direction
for
us
to
change
our
workloads
and
we
have
not.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
it
seems
to
me
that
the
posture
of
the
argument
at
this
time
â€“
it's
moot.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
no
sir,
this
--
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
--
my
contention
is
--
is
something
that's
occurred
since
the
briefs
have
actually
been
filed
here.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
well
at
the
time
--
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
no,
sir.
the
--
the
company
is
going
out
of
business
in
the
matter
of
the
last
few
weeks.
it
was
an
operating
company
but
then
this
matter
was
before
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
not
--
not
in
the
present
shape
of
its
--
of
its
operation.
no,
sir.
the
machinery
has
literally
had
been
sold
and
has
been
move
out.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
and
in
part,
this
same
issue
is
involved
in
the
goodall-sanford
case
because
there
at
the
time
the
matter
was
raised,
as
i
understand
it,
the
company
contended
that
it
was
out
of
business.
so,
the
plant
was
not
operating.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
no
sir,
because
after
this
suit
had
been
well
on
its
way
and
while
the
matter
was
pending
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
this
company
and
this
union
made
a
new
collective
agreement
and
operated
on
it
--
under
it
for
approximately
a
year.
and
there
is
a
collective
agreement
literally
in
effect
at
this
time,
although
the
company
is
out
of
business.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
it
does
not
--
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
--
the
contract
has
not
expired.
it
will
not
expire
until
next
year
under
its
terms.
although
they
--
there's
no
operation
on
this.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
no
employees
and
no
machinery.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
that's
right.
and
the
physical
premises
have
been
sold
to
other
people.
so,
other
than
our
corporate
shell
we
have
nothing
left.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
well,
if
your
honor
please,
that
is
a
question
which
remains
the
only
live
question
in
our
case
because
it's
obvious
that
if
the
court
ordered
this
to
arbitrate
workload
grievances
on
the
assignment
of
work,
it
would
be
a
--
on
an
order
to
arbitrate
something
that
was
clearly
moot.
so
that
the
only
other
question
that
would
be
alive
would
be
the
incidental
question
of
whether
or
not
these
people
are
entitled
to
some
additional
pay
for
the
period
under
which
it
would
--
that
they
operated
under
this
increased
workloads.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
i
--
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
yes,
i
think
they
would.
i
think
they
would.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
i
think,
if
your
honor
please,
the
--
the
question
of
back
pay,
well
could
not
arise
until
and
unless
an
arbitrator
had
found
that
we
had
imposed
an
excessive
workload
on
a
given
individual.
and
that
he
might
award
back
pay
to
compensate
him
in
whole
or
in
part
for
that
excessive
workload.
i
don't
think
the
back
pay
as
such
arises
until
the
other
issues
have
been
disposed
then.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
the
fundamental
questions
here
was
that
at
the
time
the
--
at
the
time
the
grievances
were
brought
by
the
union
to
the
point
of
demanding
arbitration,
the
contract
which
provided
for
arbitration
had
expired
by
the
mutual
notices
of
the
party.
there
is
no
question
and
there
is
no
question
at
any
point
in
these
proceedings
that
on
the
date
that
the
demand
for
arbitration
was
made,
there
was
no
contract
in
effect
providing
for
arbitration.
there
was
no
no-strike
clause.
there
was
no
contract
of
any
sort.
the
parties
were
operating.
the
company
was
operating
its
plant
and
the
union
presumably
was
permitting,
suffering
its
people
to
continue
employment
on
a
day-to-day
basis
without
a
--
an
expressed
contractual
provision,
then.
the
action
sounded
in
the
district
court
both
as
a
suit
for
damages
under
title
28
and
as
a
request
for
relief
under
301,
and
as
a
request
for
a
mandatory
injunction
and
a
prohibitory
injunction
to
enforce
arbitration.
the
district
court,
after
hearing
the
parties,
found
that
there
was
no
damage
proven
and
it
dismissed
that
point
and
continued,
however,
its
jurisdiction
under
the
remainder
of
the
case
by
directing
this
company
to
proceed
with
the
arbitration
of
grievances
as
provided
under
the
terms
of
the
expired
contract.
now,
to
us
that's
extremely
significant,
if
the
court
please,
because
if
you
take
the
case
in
that
posture
and
if
you
assume
the
inapplicability
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
to
this
company
as
an
employer,
that
we
can't
raise
the
norris-laguardia
act
against
injunctive
relief
directed
at
us.
we,
likewise,
could
not
invoke
the
--
under
the
terms
of
the
norris-laguardia
act,
we
could
not
invoke
the
powers
of
equity
to
enforce
the
no-strike
clause,
which
the
union
argues
is
the
consideration
for
our
agreement
to
arbitrate.
so
that
what
the
union
was
doing
was
coming
into
a
court
of
equity
and
asking
for
equitable
relief
under
a
set
of
circumstances
that
the
court
could
not
grant
equity.
the
court
could
have
ordered
us
to
arbitrate,
but
it
could
not
have
perpetuated
the
no-strike
clause
as
to
that
arbitration
under
the
terms
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
apart
that
we
contend
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
prohibit
us
--
prohibited
us
from
being
ordered
to
comply
also,
but
that's
an
ancillary
point.
the
matter
came
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
at
that
point
there
was
no
dispute
with
the
laws
of
alabama
and
the
courts
of
alabama
have
traditionally
followed
the
common
law
rule
that
an
executory
agreement
to
arbitrate
is
not
enforceable.
now,
alabama
there's
been
some
statement
as
to
the
law
of
alabama.
actually,
alabama
will
enforce
an
award
where
the
parties
have
mutually
submitted
to
arbitration
and
have
not
revoked
this
submission
before
an
award
is
granted.
but
alabama
does
not
enforce
executory
agreements
to
arbitrate.
the
circuit
court,
examining
the
matter,
found
that
the
matter
was
brought
under,
301.
but
the
301,
while
it
permitted
the
parties
the
opportunity
to
come
into
the
court,
did
not
provide
the
relief
sought
by
the
courts
or
sought
in
the
court.
and
in
so
arriving
in
that
conclusion,
the
circuit
court
took
into
very
careful
account
this
court's
decision
in
westinghouse
and
particularly
the
opinion
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
the
--
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
no.
i
say
and
particularly
the
opinion
by
you,
sir.
the
--
the
court
took
into
account
those
facts
and
they
came
up
with
their
own
version
citing
the
opinion
of
the
three
judges
which
you
wrote,
sir,
as
proof
of
their
determination
that
congress
in
enacting
301
had
not
conferred
substantive
rights
in
terms
of
creating
a
body
of
federal
common
law
for
enforcement
of
contracts.
and
in
so
determining,
the
court
felt
that
it
must
then
look
to
other
federal
statutes
and
if
there
were
no
other
federal
statutes
to
the
state
law
to
see
if
the
remedy
sought
could
be
sustained.
the
court
looked
at
the
norris-laguardia
act
and
found
rather
summarily
that
it
did
not
prohibit
the
action.
it
then
looked
at
the
federal
arbitration
act,
the
united
states
arbitration
act
and
it
found
--
as
this
court
found
in
the
polygraphic
case,
and
i
differ
with
counsel
as
to
why
we
contend
that
the
polygraphic
case
is
applicable
that
the
exception
in
the
introductory
definitions
of
the
polygraphic
case
of
the
arbitration
act
applied
to
the
whole
act.
and
to
that
point,
we
rely
on
to
the
polygraphic
case
that
the
exemption
of
contracts,
seamen
and
railroad
men
and
other
persons
engaged
in
commerce
--
i
--
i
don't
have
the
exact
language
here
--
applied
with
the
whole
act
that
it
wasn't
something
that
applied
to
section
1
of
the
act
and
not
applicable
to
2
and
3.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
worthless,
indeed.
the
fifth
circuit
undertook
to
align
itself
rather
strongly
with
the
fourth
circuit
on
that
point
and
to
disagree
rather
vigorously
with
the
third
circuit's
interpretations
or
its
later
interpretations
on
that
point,
pointing
out
that
initially,
the
third
circuit
had
reached
the
same
conclusion.
the
fifth
circuit
then
examining
--
having
examined
the
taft-hartley
act
and
the
united
states
arbitration
act,
and
having
found
no
body
of
federal
common
law
that
should
--
that
granted
the
remedy,
then
felt
that
it
could
only
apply
the
law
of
alabama
which
prohibited
the
remedy
and
it
dismissed
the
--
it
reversed
the
district
court.
it
left
open
this
question
which
we
feel
is
significant
and
will
--
will
continue
to
be
significant
in
this
matter
as
to
the
effect
of
the
expiration
of
the
contract
upon
the
demand
for
arbitration
when
the
contract
had
expired
before
arbitration
was
demanded.
now,
going
back,
if
i
may,
just
briefly
to
legislative
history
the
legislative
history
of
the
taft-hartley
act
indicates
as
to
this
point
rather
little
that
is
specific
except
two
things.
in
the
house,
when
the
bill
was
in
the
house,
the
house
committee
bill
in
its
version
of
what
ultimately
became
301,
referred
to
any
action
or
proceedings
involving
a
violation
of
a
collective-bargaining
contract.
and
in
the
same
section,
the
house
committee
expressly
provided
that
the
provisions
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
would
be
made
inapplicable
to
an
action
of
that
sort.
now,
there's
an
indication,
it
seems
to
us,
that
the
house
intended
to
give
equitable
remedies
or
give
equitable
jurisdiction
to
the
federal
courts
and
to
remove
the
obstacles
to
it.
the
senate
on
the
other
hand,
dealt
with
the
question
primarily
and
decided
to
test
statement
on
the
floor
which
was
quoted
here
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
the
--
in
his
opinion
in
--
in
westinghouse,
expressed
the
intent
of
the
senate
committee
of
being
concerned
primarily
with
removing
the
jurisdictional
obstacles
to
suits
against
the
non-incorporated
association
for
breach
of
contract.
now,
i
--
i
am
certainly
in
no
position
to
attribute
a
desire
on
the
part
of
congress
to
take
an
action
of
one
kind
or
another
or
the
lack
of
multilateralism
and
congressional
action.
there's
certainly
obvious
precedent
for
congress
passing
even
a
one-sided
statute
to
meet
an
evil
that's
apparent
to
congress
or
to
meet
a
purpose
that
it
intends
to
meet.
now,
be
that
as
it
may,
the
legislative
history
of
taft-hartley
certainly
contains
no
basis
of
assuming
that
congress
intended
for
this
court
or
for
itself
to
write
a
body
of
federal
common
law
governing
the
interpretation
of
contracts
which
are
all
is
under
the
state
law.
these
contracts
do
not
arise
under
the
federal
law.
the
national
labor
relations
act
may
have
some
impact
upon
the
obligation
to
contract,
but
the
terms
of
the
contracts
are
matters
of
state
law
and
they're
governed
by
the
laws
of
the
states.
and
those
states
who
have
--
have
seen
fit
to
make
them
enforceable
either
by
specific
performance
or
to
make
the
agreements
the
arbitrative,
irrevocable
have
enacted
statutes
to
that
effect.
and
there
are
statutes
to
that
effect.
case
is
cited
by
counsel
in
its
reply
brief
on
--
on
the
question
of
irrevocability
of
arbitration
all
arise
under
the
new
york
statute
which
expressly
so
provides.
alabama
on
the
other
hand,
has
not
elected
to
do
so.
and
we
submit
that
congress
did
not
elect
to
write
such
a
provision
for
alabama,
it
--
to
govern
it
in
the
interpretation
of
a
type
of
contract
arising
under
the
law
of
that
state.
now,
as
to
the
applicability
of
norris-laguardia,
i
say
their
point
lead
to
the
court
that
the
fifth
circuit,
not
only
was
not
impressed
with
the
argument,
but
dealt
with
it
very
summarily.
and
we
do
not
argue
as
such
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
prohibits
the
federal
court
from
granting
some
relief
under
certain
circumstances.
but
we
do
argue
that
the
norris-laguardia
act's
prohibitions
against
granting
equitable
relief
under
the
taft-hartley
act
and
because
of
the
taft-hartley
act
were
expressly
kept
active
by
the
congress
because
whatever
congress
wrote
in
injunctive
or
equitable
relief
in
the
taft-hartley,
and
provided
for
it,
it
also
expressly
provided
for
a
non-applicability
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
and
in
this
instance,
it
did
not.
and
it
may
not
be
said
in
the
light
of
the
legislative
history
that
the
--
the
application
or
the
impact
of
norris-laguardia
was
unknown
or
not
considered
by
the
congress
because
the
house
expressly
injected
it
in
the
house
bill.
as
to
the
united
states
arbitration
act
--
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
if
your
--
if
your
honor
please,
for
example,
and
this
may
not
directly
answer
the
question
at
first,
but
for
example,
certainly
the
declaration
of
public
policy
in
the
taft-hartley
act
and
the
labor
acts
did
not
express
a
congressional
intent
to
repeal
the
common
law
rule
against
enforcing
executory
agreements
to
arbitrate.
yet
here
we
are
--
are
confronted
with
an
argument
asking
us
to
embody
that
into
a
--
an
implied
federal
code
of
substantive
law.
our
answer
to
it
is
simply
this.
that
congress
is
not
without
the
means
or
the
knowledge
or
the
capacity
to
impose
a
code
of
federal
substantive
law
if
it
sees
fit.
but
it
was
perfectly
obvious
from
the
history
of
the
whole
labor
relations
program
beginning
with
the
united
states
arbitration
act
that
the
policy
of
congress
was
against
imposing
such
a
code
except
in
the
limited
fields
that
it
specified.
the
labor
opposition
to
compulsory
arbitration
is
that
whether
it
has
been
changed
by
their
position
in
this
matter
is
a
matter
of
economic
and
american
history
and
certainly
something
that
congress
was
well
aware
of.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
we
--
i'm
not
--
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
if
your
honor
pleases,
i
do
not
believe
that
congress
did
that
or
would
have
done
it
or
could
have
done
it
or
intended
to
do
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
counsel
was
talking,
i
happened
to
have
with
me
a
short
excerpt
from
a
discussion
by
senator
murray
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
in
which
he
was
expressing
some
opposition
to
the
provisions
of
301.
and
in
his
dissertation
he
pointed
out
that
301
provided
that
the
federal
courts
would
be
burdened
with
interpreting
state
law
on
the
applicability
of
contracts.
so
that
it's
perfectly
obvious
that
if
--
even
the
opponents
of
the
bill,
construed
that
provision
to
simply
mean
that
the
procedure
to
use
the
federal
court
was
there
but
that
the
law
that
applied
was
the
existing
law
of
the
states.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
well,
he
was
writing
a
minority
report,
sir.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
no,
i
--
i'm
--
i'm
not
contending
that,
but
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that
contemporaneous
understanding
of
what
these
--
these
people
were
talking
about
who
obviously
imposing
something
that
senator
murray
opposed
would
be
a
strong
indication
of
whether
or
not
there
was
any
misapprehension
on
anyone's
part
in
congress.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you
--
you
cannot
assume
that
congress
would
do
as
important
and
as
far-reaching
a
thing
as
this.
and
let
--
let
the
record,
the
committee
reports
in
the
legislation
be
completely
void
of
any
statement
on
that.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
well,
i
--
i
submit
sir
that
at
some
point
someone
would
have
made
the
point
of
what
was
intended
when
it
was
--
if
it
was
intended
to
go
that
far.
now,
on
the
united
states
arbitration
act,
if
i
may
proceed
to
that
there
again,
one
must
not
only
read
in
to
a
statute
what
is
not
there
but
must
read
into
the
legislative
history
a
complete
reversal
of
what
the
legislative
history
says
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
make
it
applicable
to
this
or
the
situation.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
there's
a
clear
legislative
history,
it's
the
legislative
history
of
the
united
states
arbitration
act
that
it
did
not
intend
to
make
it
applicable
to
agreements
involving
industrial
disputes
of
any
kind.
now,
the
argument
that
in
1925,
they
were
talking
about
contract
to
arbitration
rather
than
grievance
arbitration
and
that
sort
of
thing
is
all
very
well.
but
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
united
states
arbitration
act
provides
the
federal
remedy
here
in
the
face
of
its
language
and
its
history,
requires
that
this
court
not
only
look
at
the
legislative
history
but
reverse
it
and
to
come
up
with
a
conclusion
exactly
contrary
to
what
congress
said.
now,
it
can't
be
argued,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
american
federation
of
labor,
even
in
1925,
did
not
know
the
difference
between
a
collective
agreement
and
an
individual
contract.
and
that
it
did
not
know
the
difference
between
agreements
covering
seamen
as
the
reference
is
made
to
the
president
of
seamen's
union
and
collective
agreements
which
weren't
in
existence
at
that
time
when
there
were
collective-bargaining
agreements
in
effect
in
1925
in
a
number
of
industries.
and
yet
the
american
federation
of
labor
specifically
opposed
the
bill
and
insisted
upon
the
inclusion
of
language
exempting
industrial
disputes
from
its
terms.
and
congress
went
along.
congress
agreed.
the
secretary
of
commerce
recommended
the
change.
and
the
bill
was
changed
accordingly
and
enacted
that
way.
and
the
only
decision
of
any
court
prior
to
its
reenactment
in
the
judicial
court,
the
galland
case
expressly
held
that
that
was
the
--
the
intent
of
congress
and
so
ruled
and
congress
reenacted
it.
now,
to
say
that
the
united
states
arbitration
act
may
now
be
stretched
beyond
its
intent,
its
language,
and
its
congressional
purpose,
to
at
this
stage
in
contradiction
to
its
legislative
history
cover
--
provide
the
--
the
substantive
basis
for
a
judicial
code
or
a
federal
labor
code
that
congress
didn't
see
fit
to
write
seems
to
me
to
--
to
request
this
court
to
simply
legislate.
there
just
isn't
any
basis
of
interpretation
or
anything
else
it
can
be
sustained,
we
submit
in
the
face
of
that
legislative
history.
our
final
point
is
one
that
i
mentioned
at
the
outset.
and
that
is
the
point
of
whether
or
not
a
federal
court
may
require
an
employer
to
submit
to
final
and
binding
arbitration
matters
governing
the
operation
of
his
business
which
the
petitioners
concede
are
a
sort
of
mutuality
for
the
agreement
not
to
strike
when
the
no-strike
clause
is
no
longer
effective.
now,
in
effect,
the
district
court
extended
the
life
of
this
contract
through
the
date
of
arbitration.
if
he
extended
it
only
insofar
as
this
company
is
concerned,
it
did
not
extend
it
insofar
as
the
union
is
concerned.
it
couldn't.
and
while
the
circuit
court
did
not
reach
the
question,
we
think
it
is
--
it
is
extremely
significant
because
it's
an
indication
of
the
fallacy,
if
you
--
if
the
court
please,
of
this
alleged
distinction
between
grievance
and
contract
arbitration.
the
line
is
so
interwoven
and
the
area
is
so
commingling
that
except
in
the
rather
obvious
case
of
conceivably
a
discharge
in
reinstatement,
the
grievance
process
as
an
extension,
as
some
of
the
experts
call
it
of
the
collective-bargaining
process,
is
in
and
of
itself
a
writing
of
contracts
and
a
writing
and
implementing
and
an
expansion
of
contract.
so
that
i
think
that
the
--
the
purported
distinction
that
counsel
seeks
to
draw
between
contract
and
grievance
arbitration
is
not
a
substantial
difference
because
the
areas
intermingle
and
in
various
places
the
area
is
gray
rather
than
black
and
white.
now,
if
the
court
please,
we
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
or
the
majority
of
the
fifth
circuit
is
a
correct
decision.
that
301
did
not,
by
its
language
or
by
the
intent
of
congress,
vest
in
the
federal
courts
the
right
to
impose
a
federal
rule
requiring
the
arbitration
of
an
--
of
the
enforcement
of
an
executory
agreement
to
arbitrate
in
the
face
of
state
law
which
expressed
therein
clearly
prohibits
the
enforcement
of
such
agreement.
