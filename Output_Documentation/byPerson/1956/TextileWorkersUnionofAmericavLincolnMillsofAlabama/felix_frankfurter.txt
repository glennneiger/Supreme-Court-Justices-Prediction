justice
felix
frankfurter
why
--
why
is
it
important
to
know
what
grievances
are?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
different
grievances
may
lead
to
different
results?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
see
if
i
understand
that.
these
are
not
grievances
pertaining
to
individual
wages
of
individual
employees?
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
past
nonpayment,
which
the
union
is
right,
they
were
entitled
to?
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
that
extent,
to
that
extent
it's
westinghouse,
is
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
i
mean,
to
that
extent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
definitely
on
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
back
pay
payments
of
--
some
of
these
grievances
are
back
pay
payments.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
part?
that's
understandable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
what
are
the
people
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
say
as
the
back
pay,
it's
back
pay.
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
want
to
know
is,
you
say
that
the
new
agreement
reserved
to
grievances.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understood
that.
it's
something
that
should
be
understood.
of
course,
if
they
--
if
the
union
wins,
then,
certain
grievances
were
reserved.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
--
the
satisfaction
of
certain
grievances
was
then
--
was
reserved.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
actually
happens
if
the
union
should
win.
what
kind
of
--
would
some
men
lose
their
jobs
and
someone
gave
their
jobs?
would
there
be
if
you
mind,
explaining
me
that.
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
the
present
effectiveness
of
that
provision
of
reservation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
--
let's
see
if
i'm
correct
about
this.
actually,
this
raises
the
question,
what
kind
of
a
case
we've
got.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
understand
from
what
you
have
said,
that
what
is
involved
here
is
in
case
the
union
should
prevail,
not
merely
back
pay,
the
back
pay
would
come
to
some
men
or
all
members
for
all
i
know.
but
also,
that
certain
--
certain
labor
condition,
certain
conditions
of
employment
affecting
men
now
and
employed
would
have
been
suspended
as
if
it
were
or
have
been
put
in,
if
i
may
use
an
analogy,
have
been
put
in
escrow
as
it
were
for
determination
in
this
suit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
made
out
--
assuming
what
you
say
so
as
i
do,
you
made
out
an
existing
living
controversy
that
is
part
of
this
inquiry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
this
an
existing
dispute?
was
this
not
an
existing
dispute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
this
not
an
existing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
don't
--
and
i'm
bothered
by
your
assurance
by
your
--
by
your
qualified
assurance
that
alabama
law
does
allow
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
--
what's
the
trouble?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
understand
as
you
say
that
alabama
law
says
after
the
grievance
has
risen
between
the
builder
and
a
--
and
a
house
owner,
you
can
then
submit
it
to
arbitration
but
you
could
--
cannot
in
advance
say,
“if
agreement
should
arise,
we
will
submit.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
--
then
if
alabama
law
governed,
the
court
of
appeals
was
within
alabama
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
could
they
all
have
jurisdiction
if
there
was
no
basis
under
the
statute
under
which
they
can
entertain
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
to
say
they
had
jurisdiction,
this
time
they
had
no
jurisdiction,
of
course
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
one
more
thing
before
you
would
involve
under
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
arbitration
act,
to
which
you
will
have
to
address
to,
which
you
will
have
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
words
thus
require
--
it's
applicable
to
commerce
--
commerce
among
the
several
states.
out
of
this,
does
your
case
raise
the
question
whether
these
people,
whether
they're
textile
workers
working
for
the
lincoln
mills
was
a
case
of
commerce
among
the
several
states?
i
know
you've
said
it's
subject
to
jurisdiction
of
the
labor
board
but
that
raises
the
question
affecting
the
commerce.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
wasn't
in
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then,
is
it
--
is
it
no
longer
an
opening
question
whether
the
arbitration
act
of
1924,
when
it
says
commerce
among
the
several
states
meant
that
as
a
technical
term,
they're
in
the
case
too?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
going
to
deal
with
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
you
deal
with
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
still
an
open
question
in
the
court
below,
isn't
it,
as
to
whether
commerce
among
the
several
states
in
the
arbitration
act
is
now
as
wide
as
the
jurisdiction
of
the
labor
board?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
involved
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
questions
aren't
involved
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
which
one
of
your
four
heads
would
you
deal
with
the
question
assuming
the
federal
court
has
jurisdiction,
whether
or
not,
it
may
exercise
it
depending
on
whether
a
general
or
federal
law
applies
or
the
state
law?
under
which
one
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
subordinate
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
trying
--
i'm
trying
to
construct
the
grand
central
station
in
my
mind
so
that
your
argument
can
run
on
the
tracks
provided.
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
the
courts
of
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
do
you
do
with
the
third?
the
third
got
all
sorts
of
opinions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
you
could
reconcile
on
the
third
circuit
opinions
if
you
will?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
all
these
on
the
syntax
of
westinghouse?
some
of
them
are
pre-westinghouse.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
you
will
agree
won't
you,
mr.
goldberg,
that
in
a
problem
that
is
difficult
as
this,
this
isn't
merely
a
question
of
how
the
court
of
appeals
had
for
those
who
are
coming
and
seeing
what
the
reasoning
is,
the
district
court
in
which
they're
multitudinous.
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
--
has
the
second
circuit
decided
yet?
they
decide
--
in
the
--
in
the
case
that
came
here
on
another
connection,
they
held
that
a
manager
isn't
a
--
the
contract
of
employment
of
workers
that
he
isn't
a
worker
and
then
they
flatly
decided
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
totally
know
of
--
of
arbitration
of
provisions
of
one
sort
or
another,
touching
labor
collective
bargains?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
isn't
quite
it,
is
it?
there
was
no
suit
by
an
employee
in
westinghouse.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
difference
about
it.
it
was
a
suit
by
the
union.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
what
it
claims
to
be
its
right
under
the
collective
bargaining
to
assert
rights
to
its
member.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
didn't
any
legislation
to
operate
on
the
other?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
did
not
need
any
legislation
to
operate
on
the
other.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
i
mean,
they
didn't
need
legislation
to
get
at
the
corporation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
fact
that
it
had
both
here
shed
no
light
on
what
the
subject
matter
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
the
whole
point
of
the
legislation.
that
was
the
whole
point
that
you
could
bring
corporations
in
and
you
couldn't
bring
at
least
subject
to
great
difficulty,
you
couldn't
bring
in
unincorporated
association.
that's
the
whole
point
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
doesn't
shed
the
slightest
light
on
suits
for
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you,
mr.
goldberg.
if
the
amalgamated
clothing
workers
has
today
--
worked
today
as
it
did
in
the
past
when
i
knew
something
about
it,
loaned
money
to
an
employer
--
that
employer
corporations
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
the
default
on
that
contract.
could
they
sue
on
the
301
in
the
federal
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
could,
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
--
that's
sort
of
to
carry
out
the
general
philosophy
as
you
call
it.
that's
a
big
word
to
find
jurisdiction
in
philosophy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
but
then
they
will
come
as
i
hope
you
will
before
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
get
through
to
the
right
of
congress
to
impose
that
jurisdiction
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
the
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
how
the
amalgamated
or
through
all
of
the
matter
the
textile
company,
before
they
come
down
to
that
to
help
out
employers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
could
find
my
reference
to
the
amalgamated,
if
the
amalgamated
helps
out
an
employer
in
new
york,
who's
short
of
money,
makes
an
agreement
and
he
defaults
out
his
contract,
you
can
go
to
the
federal
court
just
on
that
contract.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
all
right.
and
that's
common
--
it's
written
in
article
3
which
you
will
explain
to
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that's
nothing
unique.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
the
court
has
also
diversity
that
cuts
down
the
scope
of
the
jurisdiction
given
by
301?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
you're
suggesting?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
it
wasn't
involved,
you
mean,
the
court
didn't
talk
about
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
we
--
but
something
gives
court
--
a
court
jurisdiction.
it
connects
a
saga
though
the
lawyers
don't
talk
about
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
for
various
reasons
for
not
talking
about
these.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
put
it
to
you
again.
does
the
adversity
because
of
diversity
under
which
the
court
has
obvious
jurisdiction,
cuts
down
on
the
jurisdiction
under
301?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
if
the
amalgamated
sues
an
employer
and
is
able
to
establish
diversity,
new
york
law
would
have
it
govern.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
amalgamated
sues
the
employer
and
says
nothing
about
diversity
but
invokes
301,
federal
law
would
govern.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you're
sure
they're
only
asking
the
court
to
hold
that
argument.
that
this
doesn't
--
this
applies
only
to
labor
relation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
isn't
that
obvious?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i've
read
that
rule.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i've
read
very
painfully.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
the
most
--
the
most
exciting
reading
in
the
world.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean,
just
at
large
that
any
suit
for
damages
by
a
labor
union
against
the
employer
comes
within
301,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
where
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
go
back
to
my
amalgamated
case
then.
a
contract
made
into
the
amalgamated
or
a
local
in
new
york
and
they
all
--
suppose
the
local
consists
entirely
of
new
yorkers,
the
locals,
having
--
being
itself
the
labor
organization.
and
they've
lent
some
money
or
they
make
an
agreement
with
an
employer,
have
nothing
to
do
with
employment,
having
to
do
with
the
financial
relationship
between
the
union
and
the
employer.
and
you're
now
suggesting,
as
you
have
--
and
you
suggest
a
little
while
ago,
that
under
that
a
suit
can
be
brought
by
or
against
the
union
in
the
federal
courts
for
damages
and
you
can
disregard
local
law
and
you
look
to
the
meaning
of
that
contract
not
at
the
new
york
laws
but
some
--
some
law
in
the
in
the
sky
as
justice
holmes
say.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
adhere
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
westinghouse
says
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
the
procedural
aspects
which
are
very
important
things
and
which
were
a
source
of
very
great
difficulty
that
i
suppose
you
know
at
least
as
well
as
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
very
great
difficulty
by
reaching
a
--
an
unincorporated
organization.
and
therefore,
they
were
means
devised
to
get
to
deal
with
that
procedural
difficulty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
how
you
can
say
it's
obvious
that
they
can
sue
for
damages,
god
knows
on
what
ground,
i
don't
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
it?
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
substantive
basis
on
which
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
damages
should
be
based
in
my
amalgamated
contract
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
the
contract
made
new
york
and
yet
you
say
you
can
go
into
the
federal
court
and
there
apply
federal
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
yet
in
the
polygraphic
case
we
had
a
clear
case
of
a
labor
agreement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
contract
had
been
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
mean
is
the
(inaudible)
we
have
a
contract.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
still
have
for
me,
at
least,
to
reach
a
profoundly
serious
question
of
what
the
basis
of
your
--
what
--
how
congress
can
give
such
a
generalized
jurisdiction
when
it
doesn't
also
furnish
a
code
of
substantive
law
authorized
by
some
grant
of
the
first
article
of
the
constitution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
mean
by
enough?
how
can
i
tell
when
--
when
enough
is
enough?
what
do
you
mean
enough?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
do
i
get
it
from?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
all
over
the
united
states,
we'll
have
construction
of
these
collective
agreements
first
by
district
courts
then
by
courts
of
appeals
and
ultimately,
to
have
this
court
sit
here
and
devise
a
labor
code.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we're
not
--
not
talking
about
the
arbitration
provision.
we're
talking
about
301.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
still
have
to
decide
these
multifarious
contracts
according
to
party
of
the
contract.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
is
there
any
review
of
the
arbiter
--
arbitral
award?
certainly
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
those
are
the
narrow
limits
that
are
vital
both
to
the
unions
and
to
employers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
do
you
mean
wouldn't
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
are
not
a
few
cases
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
are
not
a
few
cases
in
--
in
wisconsin.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
whatever
may
be
the
scope,
you
say
it's
to
be
drawn
out
of
the
general
philosophy
which
i
ought
to
draw
from
the
wagner
act
and
the
taft-hartley
act.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
give
me
very
little
light
on
problems
of
seniority;
on
layoffs
and
all
the
multitudinous
questions
about
in
which
again
you
know
so
much
more
than
i
do
that
really
makes
the
bite
in
particular,
awards.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
put
a
deal,
the
litigation
doesn't
stop
there
because
the
scope
of
the
arbitral
tribunal,
the
area
within
which
it
operates,
the
scope
of
review
of
all
questions
in
which
the
various
state
courts
differ,
naturally,
and
we'll
have
to
divide
the
separate
court
and
the
courts
are
all
over.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
may
have
had
the
very
(inaudible)
in
a
few
minutes
to
represent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
what
extent
to
the
arbitral
arrangements
operate
because
they're
in
the
agreement?
overwhelmingly,
wouldn't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore
this
--
the
--
these
were
rendered,
the
dangers
that
you
indicated,
if
this
is
not
taken
over
by
the
federal
courts,
it
can't
be
so
horrendous
because
the
arbitral
arrangement
between
responsible
unions
and
responsible
employers
will
show
a
respect
for
the
arbitration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
has
been
a
basis
from
the
beginning
of
this
court's
history,
not
quite,
that
before
we
have
a
penal
power
to
prosecute,
there
must
be
a
specific
statute
which
designates
on
substantive
offense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
whenever
congress
designates
a
statute
with
substantive
power
within
the
commerce
board,
that's
an
end
of
the
matter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
we're
debating
here
is,
what
we're
arguing
here
is
and
which
i've
had
(inaudible)
enlightened
yet
is
that
the
--
the
source
when
--
the
source
when
the
congress
got
the
power
to
say
whenever
you've
got
a
union
and
an
employer
you'd
be
going
go
to
a
federal
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
goldberg,
let
me
recall
to
you
for
you
know
--
must
know
it
well
that
there
was
an
endeavor
to
write
into
the
taft-hartley
act
a
provision
that
any
breach,
any
violation
of
a
provision
of
any
collective
agreement
shall
be
deemed
to
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
congress
explicitly
refused
to
make
that
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
that
if
you'd
have
that,
then
you
would
have
a
clear
basis.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
this
an
existing
order
to
pursue
justice
harlan's
question?
is
the
--
are
they
merely
shut
down
for
the
time
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
anybody
taking
it
over?
was
there
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
this
isn't
going
to
be
running
as
the
textile
mill
the
way
it
was?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
to
mean
exactly
that
it
is
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
suggestion
that
--
i'm
not
suggesting
this,
but
is
there
anything,
any
basis
to
say
that
they
went
out
of
business
in
relation,
because
of
or
in
connection
with
this
suit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
in
effect,
do
you
mean
that
the
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
a
period
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
are
no
employees
and
there
are
no
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
machinery
on
which
to
employ?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
ask
you
this.
whether
the
claims
for
wages
turns
on
determinations
of
some
of
the
other
types
of
grievances
to
which
mr.
goldberg
referred?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
it
may
give
a
$565
or
$47
or
whatever
the
amounts
are,
but
do
those
amounts
turn
on
questions
other
than
the
fellow
didn't
work
or
did
work?
do
they
turn
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
was
not
the
opinion
of
the
court.
that
was
not
the
opinion
of
the
court.
my
opinion
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
get
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
say
to
mr.
goldberg's
suggestion
that
accepting
your
proposition
that
the
congress
must
have
a
substantive
body
of
law
in
which
the
federal
court
can
operate,
i
don't
suppose
anybody
could
say
congress
says
we
hereby
allow
you
to
sue
labor
unions,
and
you
can
apply
any
law
that
comes
out
of
the
heads
of
judges
if
that
will
be
all
right.
but
he
says
he
didn't
like
that.
that
you
can
draw
the
substantive
code,
indeed
you
must
draw
it
from
the
recitals,
public
policy
expressed
in
the
introduction
to
the
wagner
act
and
taft-hartley
act.
and
that
gives
you
--
that
gives
a
body
of
law
that
federal
courts
can
apply
the
way
they'd
apply,
you
can
say
that
but
i
said
the
maritime
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
not
reaching
what
you're
about
to
enter
upon
and
this
discussion
of
the
arbitration
act.
but
that
--
but
that
grabs
upon
jurisdiction
of
--
that
gives
you
enough
of
a
substantive
hold
gives
the
federal
court
enough
of
a
substantive
hold
to
carry
out
adjudication.
i'm
still
talking
about
301
in
and
of
itself
having
incorporated
into
it
by
a
reference
one
of
the
context
of
the
rest
of
the
statute
material.
and
that
301
means
we
give
the
federal
courts
this
effective
way
of
getting
hold
of
an
unincorporated
association
and
for
the
governing
law,
you
look
to
the
rights
of
the
taft-hartley
act
or
whatever
this
is
a
procedural
device.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
procedural
means
of
effectuating
the
substantive
law
into
which
difficulty
we
find.
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement
of
mr.
goldberg.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suggest
that
with
all
due
respect
to
senator
murray's
regard,
it's
he
but
senator
taft
regarding
the
taft-hartley
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
that
isn't
what
determines
what
the
statute
means,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
think
you
underestimate
the
resource
of
this
in
congress.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
ask
on
that
point,
since
that's
merely
a
question
for
money
wages
--
for
wages,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
insofar
as
that
is
concerned
and
starting
with
the
decision
with
what
was
the
decision
in
westinghouse
that
301
isn't
available
for
back
pay,
what
do
you
do
with
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
but
the
--
the
decision,
if
i
understand,
and
those
who
decided,
who
made
the
court
decide,
said
that
301
was
not
available
for
suit
by
a
union
on
behalf
of
back
pay
for
its
employees.
now,
does
it
make
a
difference
whether
the
back
pay
as
in
that
case
was
whether
they
took
a
holiday
on
their
own
or
not?
would
that
make
any
difference
on
the
jurisdictional
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
in
the
industrial
area.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
to
go
to
an
arbitrator
for
money
and
there,
cannot
be
sued
directly
for
money,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
doesn't
--
if
you
hadn't
had
the
301,
you
couldn't
rely
on
301?
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
the
fact
that
there
isn't
a
federal
statute,
to
make
enforceable
some
provision
under
a
contract,
doesn't
by
itself
prove
that
jurisdiction
had
entertained
the
suit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
that's
the
trouble
that
i
have
in
this
suit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
--
i
--
i'm
not
now
opening
that
discussion
again.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
just
saying
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
for
me
is
find
difference
between
the
decision
of
this
court
in
holding
that
301,
if
a
union
must
sue
for
its
own
rights
and
can't
do
for
wages,
back
pay
for
its
men,
if
that
is
to
be
differentiated,
there
is
jurisdiction
if
the
union
passed
it
on
arbitrary,
determine
what
back
pay
should
be
given
to
the
men.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
make
sure
both
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
goldberg,
i
--
i
will
appreciate,
i
think,
that
on
the
fact
and
we
have
a
situation
here
whereby,
putting
aside
the
facts,
whereby
this
is
still
a
live
controversy
in
the
sense
that
when
you
say
a
shutdown,
that
it
already
implies
temporariness,
transient.
i
do
not
think
we've
ever
had
a
case
in
which
this
court
has
enforced
an
order
of
a
--
on
subject
intellectually,
palpable
memory
in
which
this
court
has
enforced
an
order
of
the
board
where
the
employer,
(a)
didn't
merely
transfer
to
another
who
takes
it
with
the
owners
or
(b)
has
shut
down
but
the
business
goes
on.
i
don't
think
we've
ever
had
a
case
where
the
thing
goes
out
of
business
without
any
implication
of
temporariness.
and
this
court
had
passed
on
it
merely
in
order
to
rule
for
future
purposes
in
other
situations
the
validity
of
an
order
of
the
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
shutdown
is
not
implying
a
temporary
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
i
think
it's
important.
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
the
chief
justice's
permission,
would
you
mind
dealing
with
it
in
a
memorandum
--
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
the
facts
may
make
us
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
totally
shed
a
totally
different
light
on
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
its
a
question
of
mootness
always
relate
with
new
questions
being
on
the
record.
