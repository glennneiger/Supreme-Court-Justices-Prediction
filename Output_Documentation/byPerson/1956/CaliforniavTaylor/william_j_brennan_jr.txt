justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
attorney
general,
except
for
the
matter
of
these
personnel
relations,
are
there
any
other
features
about
the
state
operation
which
differ
the
operation
of
the
road
from
ordinary
railroad
operations,
that
is
as
to
rates
for
example
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
the
--
the
only
problem
then
--
it's
limited
to
this
one
of
the
personnel
relations?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
does
that
mean
this,
mr.
williamson,
that
the
employees
in
respect
of
higher
tenure
of
employment,
wages,
seniority
will
be
--
will
no
longer
be
embraced
by
any
california
statutes,
civil
service
statutes
that
deal
with
those
subjects?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
take
a
--
let's
take
the
matter
of
wages.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
perhaps
if
there
is
a
question
because
i
don't
know
the
fact.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
the
wages
prescribed
by
some
state
legislation
which
affixes
ranges,
for
example,
salary
rates
by
ranges?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
are
they
on
a
salary
basis
by
which
i
mean
an
annual
basis,
rather
than
weekly
or
monthly
and
so
forth?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
the
statute?
on
the
--
on
the
california
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
i
mean,
under
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
well,
ordinarily,
i
think
that
state
employment
is
on
a
salary
as
distinguished
from
a
wage
or
hourly
basis
as
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
prevailing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
take
it
in
this
instance
if
your
position
is
correct.
now,
that
would
mean
that
at
least
to
the
extent,
present
legislation
puts
it
on
compensation
on
a
monthly
basis.
that
legislation
would
be
superseded
by
any
collective-bargaining
agreement
which
placed
on
an
hourly
basis,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
similarly,
i
suppose
as
to
other
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
getting
back
to
wages
for
a
moment
though.
ordinarily,
i
think
the
fixing
of
scales
in
public
employment
in
--
of
eastern
state
municipal
service
is
by
legislation,
isn't
it?
special
legislation
which
establishes
the
salary
scales?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
sometime?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
if
your
position
is
correct,
now
would
there
be
required
either
legislative
or
administrative
action
to
confirm
any
collective-bargaining
agreement
provision
which
fixed
wages?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
how
do
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
do
you
meet
mr.
wineg's
point
that
there
are
other
employees
in
related
activities
that
is
related
to
the
railroad
activity,
well
of
course,
would
not
be
covered
by
--
if
you
prevail?
and
the
disparities
which
may
arise
between
their
basis
of
compensation
and
any
that
may
be
agreed
upon
through
collective
bargaining?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
have
the
impressions
from
this
argument,
i
may
be
wrong
about
it,
but
there
was
a
direct
relation
between
the
compensation
paid
to
the
railroad
employees
and
these
other
employees
in
activities
somehow
related
to
the
railroad
work.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
tell
me
mr.
williamson
as
from
what
--
i
gather
now
from
what
you
said.
actually,
you've
been
living
for
almost
10
years
or
were
living
for
10
years
under
an
agreement,
did
that
agreement
fix
the
wage
scales?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
know
whether
there
was
any
legislative
or
administrative
action
in
relation
of
the
scales
fixed
by
the
collective-bargaining
agreement?
