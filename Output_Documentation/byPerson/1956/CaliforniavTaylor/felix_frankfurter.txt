justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you,
what
you
conceive
to
be
the
purpose
of
the
railway
labor
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
got
the
impression
form
your
opening
remarks
that
the
belt
line
is
an
important
link
in
the
interstate,
the
foreign
transportation
business,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
but
--
but
if
there
is
a
disruption
of
that
traffic,
it
would
be
important
to
interstate
and
foreign
commerce,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
question
to
--
the
problem
is
whether
the
fact
that
this
is
owned
by
california,
i
don't
know
how
many
such
situations
there
are,
there's
one
in
chicago
probably.
i
know
what
the
georgia
still
owned
a
little
railroad.
i
don't
know
how
many
other
states
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
state
owned
in
11
states?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
there's
new
york,
i
find
it
as
san
francisco
--
there's
california,
chicago
and
georgia
to
my
knowledge
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
port
of
charleston.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
the
effect
of
these
links,
that
these
are
important
links
in
--
in
interstate
and
foreign
transportations.
a
strike
on
then
may
have
the
dislocating
effect,
the
strike
on
any
such
carriers
subject
to
the
interstate
commerce
act,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
that
i
gather
--
i
thought
i
gather
the
expression
of
another
argument
that
assuming
there
is
this
potential
danger
which
you
say
we
must
of
course,
i
think
of
the
idea
of
(inaudible)
assuming
there
is
that,
over
against
that
is
the
--
the
fact
that
you
are
arguing
with
the
state
and
the
potential
incident
or
assumption
of
the
incident
of
such
a
potential
may
try
to
outweigh
by
the
state
running
its
own
people,
that's
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
when
i
--
i
prescribe
as
a
question
just
a
matter
of
--
and
ask
you
this,
is
there
any
tactical
theory
if
in
the
manner
in
which
an
extensive
to
which
reason
by
the
employees
of
the
belt
line
may
express
and
the
extent
to
which
reason
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
the
two
quotations
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
several
said,
a
collision
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
is
the
--
what
--
what
is
the
collision
that
matters
in
this
field
whereby
a
state
policy
in
dealing
with
its
employees
would
be
thwarted
or
limited
to
certain
matters.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
procedure
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
picking
on
you
but
i
just
want
to
picture
the
procedure
of
this.
are
there
any
differences
in
the
context
if
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
to
the
kind
of
things
that
your
employees
may
claim
for
your
machinery
as
against
what
they
may
claim
before
an
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
putting
that
to
one
side,
the
one
thing
in
carrying
that
out
is
to
giving
effectiveness
to
that.
what
--
what
is
it,
the
states,
would
be
deprived
of
that
or
have
it
in
if
reason
for
you,
you
have
to
go
to
the
department
of
the
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
forgot
to
say
the
--
i
thought
(inaudible)
are
these
--
these
employees
members
of
the
brotherhood?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
are,
all
of
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
operate
it
by
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
that
raised
a
new
problem?
maybe
the
fact
that
these
men
are
in
the
brotherhood
depending
whether
to
stand
and
so
on?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
--
they
have
skippered
agreements
and
they
are
fellows
in
the
brotherhood.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
wages
--
wages
and
condition,
and
shifts
and
the
runs
and
so
on?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
adopted,
you
accepted
to
those
outside
rates
but
they're
yours?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
when
it
is
(inaudible),
doesn't
that
carry
money
penalty
provisions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
could
indicate
in
there
what's
--
if
that's
an
enforcement
of
a
penalty
or
an
injunction
that
the
congress
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
have
had
to
take
care
of
the
eleventh
amendment?
should
the
united
states
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
this
would
be
a
burden
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
money
award?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
a
judgment
of
a
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
ask
you?
how
did
the
employers
--
employees
sue
the
state
of
california?
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
could
be
reviewed
as
wrong.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
has
been
held
to
cover
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
it
covers
suits
under
the
f
--
f.e.l.a.
justice
felix
frankfurter
state
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
won't
trouble
you
with
it.
but
i
think
that
was
a
nice
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
to
collective
--
as
the
bargain.
that's
the
regular
collective-bargaining
of
--
of
the
brotherhood,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
that
--
was
that
the
terms
of
the
collective
agreement
is
to
try
until
the
california
supreme
court's
decision
in
1954?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
--
and
since
then,
it
has
been
suspended?
justice
felix
frankfurter
1942
to
1954,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what's
been
happening
since
1954?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
don't
mean
to
repeat
the
question,
but
the
actual
paying,
the
actual
scale
of
wages
has
not
been
accorded
to
the
scale
of
remuneration,
has
not
been
according
to
the
collective
agreement
of
payment
in
(inaudible)
but
according
to
the
california
scale?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
concession
of
california
and
not
as
the
compulsion
of
the
agreement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
--
you
can't
try
to
say
that
like
that.
it's
far
beyond
even
that
problem
but
namely,
this
court
has
said
the
eleventh
amendment
does
involve
pleadings
against
--
to
be
sure
state
officials
exceeds
and
see
how
that
no
states
could
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
that
--
i
assume
that
the
gambit
is
by
an
employee
of
the
belt
line
for
$675
against
the
state
of
california
eo
nomine,
by
that
name
and
as
the
only
owner
because
nobody
else
owns
it.
it
couldn't
possibly
be
a
case
of
eleventh
amendment,
could
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
wasn't
talking
about
the
statute
since
there's
no
problem.
