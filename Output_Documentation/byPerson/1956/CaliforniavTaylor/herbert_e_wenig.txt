mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
a
little
switching
railroad
at
the
harbor
of
san
francisco.
the
railroad
is
one
the
facilities
of
san
francisco
harbor.
san
francisco
harbor
is
operated
by
the
state
of
california
to
facilitate
the
national
and
international
trade
of
the
port.
the
harbor
board
is
appointed
by
the
governor.
the
employees
of
the
state
belt
railroad
since
1913
have
been
members
of
the
state
civil
service.
our
state
constitution
requires
that
all
employees
of
the
state
with
certain
minor
exceptions
shall
be
members
of
the
california
state
civil
service
system.
in
1942,
a
demand
was
made
upon
the
harbor
board
that
it
enter
into
a
collective
bargaining
contract
pursuant
to
the
railway
labor
act
fixing
wages,
hours,
and
terms
of
employment
for
the
employees
of
the
state
belt.
there
is
no
--
it
is
admitted
here
that
the
state
belt
railroad
is
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
as
well
as
settled
by
united
states
against
california.
the
successor,
a
--
a
contract
was
entered
into
effective
september
1,
1942.
a
successor
of
harbor
board
questioned
the
authority
of
the
--
the
previous
board
to
enter
into
this
contract
and
requested
the
attorney
general
to
bring
a
declaratory
relief
action
in
the
california
courts
to
determine
the
validity
of
the
contract
and
whether
california
was
subject
to
the
railway
labor
act.
the
california
supreme
court
held
that
the
general
language
of
the
railway
labor
act
was
not
to
be
interpreted
as
being
applicable
to
the
state
of
california.
thereupon,
the
respondents
here,
who
were
members
of
the
state
belt
employees
and
who
had
filed
claims
before
the
adjustment
board
under
this
contract,
brought
an
action
to
require
the
adjustment
board
to
proceed
to
hear
and
determine
the
claims
which
had
been
filed
under
the
1942
contract.
the
reason
this
arose
was
that
--
following
the
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court,
the
carrier
members
of
the
board
had
refused
to
proceed
with
the
cases
on
the
ground
that
the
matter
had
been
settled
by
the
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court.california
intervened
in
this
mandamus
action
and
filed
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
district
court
granted
our
judgment
on
the
ground,
the
california
decision
was
determinative.
however,
the
seventh
circuit
reversed
and
held
contrary
to
the
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court
that
the
railway
labor
act
was
applicable
to
a
state
in
its
operation
of
a
carrier
in
interstate
commerce.
now,
the
essential
problem
we
have
here
is
whether
the
railway
labor
act
is
applicable
to
the
state
of
california.
the
act,
if
your
honors
please,
covers
a
carrier
by
railroad
subject
to
the
interstate
commerce
act.
and
the
interstate
commerce
act
in
turn
applies
to
all
carriers
engaged
in
the
transportation
of
passages
and
property
holding
by
railroad.
in
other
words,
the
railway
labor
act
compendiously
adopts
the
determination
of
what
is
to
be
considered
as
interstate
railroad
commerce.
the
act
requires
all
carriers
as
employers
to
engage
in
collective
bargaining
with
representatives
chosen
for
each
craft
on
its
property.
duties
are
imposed
with
respect
to
the
selection
of
representatives.
the
duty
to
collectively
bargain
may
be
enforced
by
injunction
as
this
court
decided
in
the
virginian
railroad
case.
all
disputes,
and
this
is
how
we
arrive
in
chicago,
all
disputes
under
the
act,
regarding
the
interpretation
of
contracts
may
be
taken
by
either
party
to
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
and
--
and
a
money
award
made
to
an
employee
may
be
enforced
on
--
by
the
specific
terms
of
the
act
by
suit
against
the
employer
in
one
of
the
federal
district
courts.
so,
we
are
faced
essentially,
your
honors,
with
determining
if
congress
in
using
the
general
language
of
the
act,
all
carriers
subject
to
the
interstate
commerce
act
by
that
general
language
intended
to
control
a
state's
relationship
with
its
employees
when
that
state
is
engaged
in
conducting
a
carrier
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
in
other
words,
must
our
civil
service
laws
give
way
to
the
--
to
the
collective
bargaining
provisions
of
the
railway
labor
act.
the
history
of
the
act
shows
that
congress
gave
no
consideration
to
the
fact
that
there
might
be
here
and
there,
a
--
a
carrier
owned
by
a
state,
such
as
our
switching
railroad,
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
as
this
court
has
pointed
out,
the
act
was
the
result
of
a
--
of
a
conference,
a
industry
wide
conference
composed
of
some
55
railroads
and
20
labor
unions
which
produced
this,
as
we
have
to
call
it,
this
instrument
for
government
in
their
--
in
the
railroad
industry,
to
congress
and
it
was
so
adopted.
in
approaching
this
problem,
we
rely
upon
the
rule
that
where
there
is
a
restrictive
statute
and
it's
--
the
claim
is
that
it's
applicable
to
government
that
the
restrictive
statute
will
not
be
applied
unless
there
are
expressed
words
to
that
effect
or
unless
there
are
affirmative
reasons
for
believing
that
congress
intended
to
apply
it
to
the
state.
the
latest
--
one
of
the
latest
expressions
was
by
this
court
in
the
wittek
case.
now,
what
are
the
basic
and
in
that
regard,
we
should
examine
the
act
as
has
been
said
in
its
total
environment.
what
were
the
objective
of
the
act
and
the
subject
matter
and
so
forth?
well,
the
stated
purposes
of
the
act
in
section
151
(a)
were
that
to
avoid
interruptions
in
commerce
and
in
it
--
in
the
interstate
railroad
commerce,
the
employers
should
engage
in
collective
bargaining
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
rates,
hours
and
working
conditions
for
their
employees.
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
yes.
i
--
i'm
--
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
in
just
a
few
moments,
i'll
do
that.
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
the
stated
objective
of
the
railway
labor
act
was
to
prevent
strikes
which
would
be
obstructions
in
interstate
commerce.
strikes
are
not
characteristic
of
public
employment.
the
labor
management
act
provides
that
federal
employees
are
even
prohibited
from
striking
and
may
even
lose
their
civil
service
jobs
if
they
do
so.
but
as
a
general
matter,
strikes
against
the
government,
whether
it
be
state
or
federal
were
not
characteristic
of
public
employment.
the
other
objective
of
the
railway
labor
act,
it's
stated
by
--
by
this
court
in
the
virginian
case
was
to
eliminate
the
evil
of
the
company
union,
the
very
terminology
itself
indicates
that
this
was
not
characteristic
of
public
employment.
but
now
i
come
to
the
remedy
which
congress
sought
to
prevent
company
unions
and
strikes.
collective
bargaining,
almost
universally,
the
court's
everywhere
hold
that
collective
bargain,
the
system
of
establishing
wages
and
hours
by
the
contract
method
are
not
characteristic
of
state
or
local
employment,
these
matters
are
set
by
statute
and
ordinance.
so,
we
have
two
factors
here
as
a
actual
fact,
we
didn't
have
collective
bargaining
in
public
employment,
and
we
have
numberless
cases
holding
that
the
public
authorities
do
not
possess
the
authority
to
establish
working
conditions
by
collective
bargaining.
president
roosevelt
said
in
1937,
in
a
--
in
a
letter
to
the
national
federation
of
federal
employees,
"all
government
employees
should
realize
that
the
process
of
collective
bargaining
as
usually
understood,
cannot
be
translated
--
transplanted
into
the
public
service.
it
has
its
distinct
and
insurmountable
limitations
when
applied
to
public
personnel
management.
and
we
had
the
same
problem
in
the
united
mine
workers
case,
when
we
had
the
question
of
whether
the
general
term
"employer"
in
the
norris-la
guardia
act
could
or
should
be
applied
to
the
federal
government
when
the
federal
government
was
acting
as
an
employer.
and
mr.
justices
black
and
douglas
in
that
case
said
in
--
in
applying
the
term
employer
or
not
--
applying
it,
congress
had
never
in
its
history
provided
a
program
for
fixing
wages,
hours
and
working
conditions
for
its
employees
by
collective
bargaining.
working
conditions
of
government
employees
had
not
been
the
subject
of
collective
bargaining
nor
been
settled
as
a
result
of
labor
disputes.
and
this
is
where
we
place
our
stand
at
this
point
in
the
case.
it
would
require
specific
congressional
language
to
persuade
us
that
congress
intended
to
embark
upon
such
a
noble
program.
and
we
submit
that
the
requirement
that
a
state
engaged
in
collective
bargaining
would
be
just
as
much
a
noble
program.
and
to
use
a
colloquialism,
i
would
say
that
what
was
source
for
the
"federal
goose"
in
united
mine
workers
case,
it
should
be
source
for
the
state
gander
in
this
case.
now,
furthermore,
when
we
examined
this
act,
there
are
no
necessary
implications
from
the
scheme
of
the
act
that
it
should
apply
to
a
state
carrier.
by
contrast,
in
united
state
against
california,
we
have
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
safety
appliance
act
which
was
in
general
terms
applicable
to
common
carriers
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
should
apply
to
this
very
state
belt
railroad.
and
the
court
at
that
time
looked
at
the
objective
of
the
act
which
was
to
protect
the
employees
and
the
public
from
defective
appliances
in
the
interstate
railroad
commerce
and
the
remedy
was
uniform
safety
appliances
and
the
court
said,
"well,
that
--
the
need
for
a
uniform
safety
appliance
is
just
as
needful
on
a
state
owned
cars
or
privately
owned
car."
and
then
the
court
pointed
out
and
said,
"this
act
then
was
all
--
was
national
on
purpose
and
all
embracing
in
scope
and
held
this
very
state
belt
railroad
subject
to
the
act."
but
in
this
case,
we
do
not
have
any
necessary
implications
from
the
plan
of
the
act
itself
that
a
state
should
be
subject
to
it.
the
act
doesn't
provide
for
nationwide
collective
bargaining.
the
--
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
no,
your
--
no,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
exactly,
your
honor.
the
report
of
the
national
mediation
board
for
20
years
shows
that
there
had
been
--
there
are
now
registered
with
the
boards
some
5190,
collective-bargaining
contracts
made
under
the
railway
labor
act
and
that
while
there
have
been
some
national
wage
movements
that
these
contracts
vary
from
contract
to
contract,
and
a
matter
of
fact,
you
will
find
that
different
unions
represent
the
same
craft
on
different
properties.
so,
our
point
here
is
that
there
are
--
there
is
nothing
within
the
--
the
plan
of
this
act
which
is
national
in
scope
and
all
embracing
in
purpose
so
that
to
keep
the
state
out
of
it
would
interfere
with
--
with
a
nationwide
plan.
now,
--
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
the
purpose
of
the
railway
labor
act
is
to
avoid
disruptions
in
national
railroad
commerce
through
strikes
and
other
labor
disputes
by
requiring
employers
and
employees
to
collectively
bargain
regarding
these
matters
and
to
prevent
disputes
regarding
either
representation
or
interpretation
of
contracts
being
--
to
provide
that
those
disputes
shall
be
settled
by
adjustment
to
the
adjustment
board
all
through
the
mediation
board.
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
well,
as
to
the
--
to
the
extent
that
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
moving
of
a
commerce
of
our
port,
it's
about
five
miles
in
--
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
--
in
length.
along
that
line,
your
honor,
we
--
we've
been
on
operation
some
66
years
and
we
haven't
had
any
--
any
strikes.
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
yes,
your
honor,
it
would
be
an
important
factor
--
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
but
to
--
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
at
the
present
time
at
my
--
our
last
check,
they
were
11
such
small
railroads.
they
are
mostly
terminal
or
--
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
publicly
--
not
11
states,
sir,
but
owned
by
either
states
or
public
agencies.
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
the
port
of
charleston
--
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
and
there's
a
public
belt
in
new
orleans.
there
are
11
of
them
--
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
the
point
which
i've
just
made
is
that
although
the
fear
of
strikes
was
the
evil
toward
which
the
railway
labor
act
was
directed,
strikes
by
public
employees
are
--
were
not
characteristic
of
state
operation.
now,
--
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
yes,
your
honor.
and
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
us
if
we
would
comment
on
the
effect
of
this
has
upon
a
state's
relationship
with
its
employees.
of
course,
as
far
--
where
a
state
has
a
civil
service
system
such
as
ours,
of
course,
there
is
a
disrupting
factor
in
the
integrity
of
the
civil
service
system.
we
have
about
a
125
employees,
i
believe,
the
record
shows
there
are
225
operating
this
railroad,
we
have
some
425
harbor
employees,
wharfingers
and
others
who
are
working
along
side
them,
whose
working
conditions
are
established
pursuant
to
the
terms
of
civil
service.
furthermore,
the
whole
concept
of
requiring
state
officers
to
engage
in
collective
bargaining
raises
the
very
difficult
question
as
to
whether
they
have
any
such
power.
the
only
power
they'd
have
would
be
derived
from
the
supremacy
clause
and
the
demand
of
the
railway
labor
act.
but
from
the
stand
point
of
--
of
the
constitutional
position
of
the
state
in
that
scheme,
it
is
always
been
recognized
that
the
states
as
the
vital
parts
--
the
vital
parts
of
the
federal
plan
have
the
authority,
not
only
to
select
their
employees
but
to
determine
the
conditions
under
which
they
will
carry
out
state
functions.
now
--
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
yes,
your
honor.
this
--
as
far
as
the
state
is
concerned,
there
is
a
no
prohibition
regarding
the
membership
in
unions.
for
example
the
two-brother
--
the
state
belt
employees
who
are
involved
in
this
case
and
their
fellow
employees
are
perfectly
free
to
belong
to
a
labor
union
and
ought
to
make
representations
to
the
proper
state
authorities.
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
it's
--
it's
just
growing
up
--
there
--
there
have
been
no
prohibition
--
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
well
we
--
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
no,
your
honor.
by
court
decision,
however,
we
have
--
it
has
been
determined
that
public
employees
of
municipalities
may
not
strike
for
the
purpose
of
--
of
securing
working
conditions
through
collective
bargaining.
that's
the
established
law
of
the
state.
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
there's
no
state
law
--
there's
--
there
are
only
some
local
ordinances
regarding
policemen
and
firemen
preventing
them
from
belonging
to
a
union.
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
we
have
a
system
already
set
up
--
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
not
--
not
very
well,
your
honor.
we
have
a
grievance
system.
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
this
collision
is
what
--
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
well,
in
the
first
place
we
--
the
state
has
sat
down
what
it
thinks
to
be
the
desirable
method
and
--
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
its
--
its
--
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
well
there
are
--
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
well,
i
must
be
going
out
of
the
record
if
i
wanted
to
state
--
what
i
thought
be
an
actual
practical
advantages
were
which
had
been
produced
through
a
civil
service
system
but
i
think
that
the
--
not
only
procedure
wise,
your
honor,
that
is
--
it
would
be
disruptive
of
the
plan
established
by
our
own
legislature,
but
then
you
enter
into
considerable
legal
concepts
of
the
right
of
the
state
to
control
its
own
relationship
and
so
forth.
those
are
the
things
that
--
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
well,
would
have
--
we'd
be
engaged
in
numberless
collective-bargaining
undertakings.
it's
of
course
confining
myself
just
to
the
impact
of
the
--
that
railway
labor
act,
it
would
be
different
and
may
--
that
leads
me,
if
your
honor
pleases,
to
a
point
of
observation
that
possibly
because
of
the
problems
which
arise
when
a
--
an
attempt
is
made
to
apply
collective-bargaining
techniques
to
public
employment,
congress
in
the
labor
management
act,
of
course,
has
accepted
both
the
federal
government
and
the
states
with
respect
to
employers
having
to
engage
in
collective
bargaining.
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
yes.
these
--
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
--
these
are
here,
of
course,
when
you
get
into
a
legal
problem
too
as
to
whether
the
state
can
undertake
to
set
conditions
and
wages
by
bargaining
with
the
representative
of
only
possibly
a
majority
of
its
state
employees,
an
the
theory
that
there
should
be
an
equal
opportunity
for
setting
those
things
on
behalf
of
all
--
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
no.
not
--
not
on
our
problem.
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
they
have
in
this
particular
contract
and
in
this
--
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
no.
because
we
have
a
provision
in
our
state
law
which
requires
the
board
to
set
wages
by
the
prevailing
rate
and
often
rules
--
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
there
--
there
are
--
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
there
are
rates
--
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
the
dispute
is
whether
--
we
are
subject
to
the
railway
labor
act
in
--
and
--
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
oh,
you
mean
as
far
as
the
claims
before
the
adjustment
board?
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
they
in
--
in
effect,
they
are
disputes
over
differences
between
provisions
regarding
seniority
and
over
time
and
things
of
that
sort
which
are
in
conflict
with
our
--
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
with
state
civil
service
law,
and
when
the
successor
board
came
on,
they
questioned
the
authority
of
the
former
board
to
make
this
contract
and
where
there
was
a
collision
between
the
provisions
of
the
contract
and
civil
service
law,
they
refused
to
proceed.
as
a
result,
the
claims
have
been
filed
with
the
adjustment
board
and
the
seventh
circuit
has
ordered
to
board
to
proceed
to
or
to
issue
an
award.
and
which
brings
me
to
the
final
point
--
my
time
is
up.
there
is
a
serious
question,
of
course,
as
to
whether
the
award,
money
award
to
be
issued
by
the
adjustment
board
could
be
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
the
act
enforced
against
the
state
in
the
--
in
the
federal
court
because
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
oh,
well
i
--
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
i
would
just
going
to
add
that
following
your
thought,
mr.
justice
black
that
we
have
in
the
interpretation
of
the
act,
the
question
as
to
whether
congress
ever
intended
this
act
to
apply
to
a
state
when
they
provided
this
enforcement
measures.
and
one
of
which
is
that
the
awards
made
by
the
adjustment
board
will
be
or
may
be
enforced
by
actions
in
the
federal
court.
now,
of
course,
the
eleventh
amendment
is
a
direct
bar
to
such
a
suit
and
it's
just
another
indication
that
congress
would
not
have
put
in
this
enforcement
provision
if
it
had
in
mind
the
possibility
that
a
state
carrier
would
be
the
defendant
in
such
an
action.
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
only
fines,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
yes.
that
is
--
that's
correct.
and
of
course
it
--
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
the
case
that
came
here
--
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
that's
--
that's
the
difference
there,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
this
would
be
a
--
a
suit
of
--
on
behalf
the
in
--
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
of
the
award
by
the
--
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
by
the
individual
employees.
so,
when
you
look
at
the
purpose
of
this
act,
the
subject
matter
of
the
act,
the
evils
toward
which
it
was
directed,
the
fact
that
congress
has
in
all
other
acts
dealing
with
interstate
commerce
exempted
the
states.
and
the
fact
that
there
are
some
constitutional
doubts
as
to
whether
congress
could
interfere
with
the
states'
rights
to
arrange
its
own
working
conditions
upon
which
employees
were
represented.
i
say
that
all
of
this
converges
to
give
us
the
conclusion
that
congress
never
intended
this
act
to
apply
to
a
state
carrier.
mr.
herbert
e.
wenig
on
the
ground
that
there
are
no
affirmative
objections.
for
example
that
collective-bargaining
is
not
a
--
a
characteristic
or
referable
to
state
government.
whereas,
the
safety
appliance
act
merely
deals
with
a
piece
of
equipment
on
a
carrier
and
there
is
really
no
distinction
between
state
owned
carriers
and
--
and
privately
owned
carriers.
