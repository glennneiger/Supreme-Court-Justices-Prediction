mr.
burke
williamson
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
of
california
as
seen
fit
to
go
in
the
railroad
labor
business
and
the
railroad
business
is
fine
from
our
standpoint.
it
makes
jobs
for
our
men.
we
are
glad
that
california
is
in
the
railroad
business.
but
there's
been
trouble
ever
since
california
went
in
that
business
with
the
extent
to
which
federal
law
applied
to
the
state
belt
railroad.
this
court
has
already
had
before
it
the
question
of
the
applicability
of
the
federal
safety
appliance
act
to
the
state
belt
railroad.
this
court
said
it
would
--
it
applied
to
the
state
belt
railroad.
out
in
california,
a
california
court
had
the
question
of
whether
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
applied
to
the
state
belt
railroad.
the
decision
was,
"yes,
it
does."
a
federal
court
of
appeals
had
the
question
of
whether
the
federal
carriers
taxing
act
applied
to
the
state
belt
railroad.
the
answer
was,
"it
does."
now,
i
suppose
we're
at
--
perhaps,
the
last
question,
"does
the
railway
labor
act
apply
to
the
state
of
california
in
the
operation
of
this
railroad?"
counsel
has
said
--
mr.
burke
williamson
california
--
mr.
burke
williamson
california,
sir,
has
a
--
an
act
which
permits
suits
against
the
state
to
a
limited
extent.
mr.
burke
williamson
there's
no
doubt
of
it,
sir.
that's
at
the
will
of
the
state.
they
may
change
at
any
time.
mr.
burke
williamson
that
has
been
held
to
cover
the
operation
of
this
very
railroad.
mr.
burke
williamson
under
--
under
the
f.e.l.a.
it
does
provide,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
suit
must
be
brought
in
a
california
court.
but
as
i
understand
it
again,
a
state
may
--
mr.
burke
williamson
the
state
court.
a
state
can
fix
--
mr.
burke
williamson
counsel
has
described
this
railroad
as
a
switching
railroad.
but
i
think
it's
been
pointed
out
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
it
is
an
important
railroad
and
it
is
--
has
been
held
to
be
in
interstate
commerce.
that
is
the
answer
to
the
question
of
how
important
it
is.
it's
been
asked
by
mr.
justice
harlan
about
the
practical
defects
of
the
application
of
the
railway
labor
act
to
this
road.
i
think
there
won't
be
any
difficulty
in
applying
it
to
this
road.
specifically,
california
in
its
brief
admits
that
if
the
railway
labor
act
applies
to
this
railroad
that
the
california
constitutional
provision
with
respect
to
employment
of
its
own
workers
is
automatically
repealed.
we
have
a
contract
in
this
case,
late
in
1942,
if
the
railway
labor
act
is
applicable
to
the
state
of
california,
then
we've
got
the
contract
already.
mr.
burke
williamson
sir,
i
think
the
answer
is
that
so
far
as
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
covers
the
particular
points
that
is
supreme.
now,
as
to
what
would
be
the
effect
on
items
of
employment
not
covered
in
the
collective-bargaining
agreement,
i
would
think
--
mr.
burke
williamson
--
that
california
law
would
still
be
there.
mr.
burke
williamson
yes,
sir.
mr.
burke
williamson
yes,
sir.
mr.
burke
williamson
that
--
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
burke
williamson
it
--
it
is
by
the
hour
in
majority
of
instances,
i
believe.
mr.
burke
williamson
under
the
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
under
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
--
mr.
burke
williamson
--
under
california
act.
perhaps
mr.
wenig
could
help
me
on
this.
i
believe
it's
on
a
monthly
basis.
mr.
burke
williamson
as
mr.
--
that's
correct,
sir.
as
mr.
wineg
said,
the
california
policy
is
to
pay
its
state
employees
wages
comparable
to
those
--
mr.
burke
williamson
--
yes,
in
private
employment.
therefore,
i
think
there
has
been
no
conflict
on
that.
mr.
burke
williamson
that
--
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
burke
williamson
in
any
place
where
there
might
be
conflict.
i
should
say
that
the
chief
conflict,
mr.
justice
brennan,
would
come
in
seniority.
the
railroad
brotherhoods
take
seniority
very
seriously.
mr.
burke
williamson
i
think
that
is
correct,
sometime
by
administrative
--
some
regulations.
mr.
burke
williamson
i
think,
sometimes
the
legislation
permits
administrative
regulation
of
wages.
mr.
burke
williamson
i
believe
not,
sir.
as
mr.
wineg
has
pointed
out
in
his
brief,
the
california
constitution
itself
sets
up
one
term
of
employment,
at
least.
and
he
says
in
his
brief
that
if
the
railway
labor
act
is
held
applicable
by
this
court,
there
will
be
an
automatic
rescission
of
that
california
constitutional
provision
because
there
is
a
general
provision
in
the
california
constitution
which
admits
the
supremacy,
of
course,
of
the
national
law.
and
i
believe
that
there
are
possible
some
repeal
might
have
to
be
made
on
--
on
some
matters.
but
i
think
none
of
it
would
be
insuperable
at
all.
now,
i
--
mr.
burke
williamson
i
believe
it's
very
simple
in
fact.
mr.
burke
williamson
well,
i
think
there
would
be
no
trouble
because
the
other
employees
would
not
be
in
the
railroad
labor
world.
the
employees
who
are
sought
to
be
brought
under
the
railway
labor
act
are
strictly
those
engaged
in
railroad
operations.
mr.
burke
williamson
and
the
other
employees,
i
believe,
sir,
are
--
are
not
in
that
class
or
craft.
mr.
burke
williamson
well,
how
closely
related
they
are.
i
can't
say,
sir.
in
his
brief,
he
points
out
that
some
employees
of
the
state
of
california
are
not
subject
to
any
federal
law
because
they've
been
excluded
under
the
labor
relations
act.
and
i
--
i
think
there
would
--
the
two
types
of
work
would
not
be
close
enough
so
that
there
would
be
any
real
trouble.
now,
here,
we
--
we
have
the
--
the
contract
already.
this
isn't
a
case
of
going
out
and
making
a
contract.
we've
had
one
since
1942
and
we
--
mr.
burke
williamson
--
we
operated
under
it
until
the
california
supreme
court
said,
"california
in
its
operation
is
not
subject
to
the
railway
labor
act."
mr.
burke
williamson
we
began
in
september
1942.
mr.
burke
williamson
and
my
recollection
is
that
the
--
the
california
litigation
began
about
1948
or
1949
and
the
--
the
california
supreme
court
acted
in
1951.
and
it
was
not
until
that
time
that
the
railway
--
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
took
the
position
that
it
would
not
pass
on
these
california
claims
anymore.
i
think,
mr.
wineg
--
pardon
me?
mr.
burke
williamson
i
think
mr.
wineg
was
a
little
in
error
when
he
said
that
the
time
claims
or
that
the
claims
now
pending
before
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
are
all
in
conflict
with
some
california
legislative
or
administrative
action
with
respect
to
terms
of
employment.
he
does
in
his
brief
summarize
what
these
claims
are
and
in
almost
each
instance,
the
defense
is
raised
by
the
state
of
california
before
the
adjustment
board
that
there
is
no
contract
because
the
railway
labor
act
doesn't
apply
to
the
state.
now,
i
have
--
there
are
maybe
some
instances
in
which
there
is
some
conflict
between
the
provision
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
and
the
provision
of
the
california
law
but
that
can't
be
told
from
mr.
wineg's
summary
of
them,
as
found
at
pages
6
and
7
of
his
brief.
mr.
burke
williamson
it
did,
sir.
mr.
burke
williamson
that's
correct,
sir.
it's
here
in
the
--
the
record
and
it's
just
like
any
other
collective-bargaining
agreement
made
by
any
labor
union
on
behalf
of
the
crafter
class.
mr.
burke
williamson
there
was
not,
i
think.
however,
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
seventh
circuit
in
passing
on
the
case
there
did
say
that
in
as
much
as
the
parties
had
lived
under
it
for
this
length
of
time,
that
court
would
assume
that
there
must
have
been
at
least
acquiescence
in
the
situation
by
whatever
state
officials
in
california
might
have
been
involved.
mr.
burke
williamson
that
is
--
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
burke
williamson
at
the
present
time,
i
think
the
--
the
parties
are
operated
--
mr.
burke
williamson
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
burke
williamson
well,
sir,
it
was
in
1951
that
the
california
supreme
court
acted.since
that
time,
sir,
that
the
state
of
california
has
taken
the
position
that
they
are
not
--
not
under
the
railway
labor
act
and
that
they
won't
--
that
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
has
no
right
to
pass
on
their
claims.
mr.
burke
williamson
well,
sir,
i'm
afraid
that
isn't
in
the
record
and
i'm
not
absolutely
certain,
but
it's
my
impression
that
--
that
they
are
being
paid.
the
amount
provided
in
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
as
increased
of
--
through
increases
granted
california
state
employees.
mr.
burke
williamson
i
think
that
is
correct,
sir.
so,
they
have
managed
to
get
on
under
some
sort
of
a
working
agreement.
the
case
of
united
mine
workers
has
been
brought
up
here
in
connection
with
whether
the
railway
labor
act
applied
and
pension
has
been
provided
to
the
concurring
opinion
of
mr.
justice
douglas
and
mr.
justice
black.
i
say
that
that
case
can
be
easily
distinguished
from
this
particular
situation
and
that
that
case
arose
under
the
war
disputes
act.
there
was
a
--
a
national
emergency
under
which
the
mines
were
taken
over
and
operated
by
the
government
as
their
employer.
we
have
here
today
a
railroad
being
operated
year
after
year,
66
years
by
a
state.
it's
chosen
to
go
into
that
business
as
it
has
the
right
to
do.
but
i
say
that
it's
a
proprietary
function
of
a
state
when
it
operates
a
road
like
this
and
it
does
not,
in
any
manner,
involve
the
united
states
of
america
as
an
employer
in
an
emergency
situation
which
was
intended
to
last
on
a
very
short
time.
we
think
that
this
court
has
only
the
one
thing
left
to
decide
and
that's
the
applicability
of
the
railway
labor
act
that
stayed
in
its
operation
at
this
road
and
that
when
that's
been
decided,
the
road
will
have
been
brought
into
the
category
of
all
other
railroads,
whether
they
are
operated
by
a
state
or
anyone
else.
mr.
burke
williamson
the
eleventh
amendment
suggestion
is
--
is
one
which
brings
before
this
court,
i
think,
a
--
a
new
point.
mr.
burke
williamson
i
have
not
been
able
to
--
mr.
burke
williamson
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
any
decision
of
this
court
directly
in
point.
we
have
found
some
which
we
think
are
quite
close.
in
our
brief,
we
refer
to
a
prout
case
decided
by
this
court,
p-r-o-u-t,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
prout
to
say,
in
which
the
tenth
amendment
was
said
to
constitute
a
limitation
on
the
right
of
congress
under
article
i
clause
8.
this
court
decided
that
the
grant
of
power
to
congress
would
take
precedence
over
anything
which
might
be
said
concerning
the
tenth
amendment
that
prout
case
was
cited
by
a
court
of
appeals
in
a
situation
which
i
regard
is
identical
with
this
present
case.
that
case
is
down
in
mississippi.
it
was
came
from
mississippi.
it
was
called
the
illinois
central
railroad
company
versus
the
mississippi
railroad
commission.
the
commission
was
obviously
a
body
of
the
state
of
mississippi.
mr.
burke
williamson
well,
it
maybe
that
in
as
much
as
the
decision
of
this
court
affirming
the
court
of
appeals
did
say
that
the
commission
was
not
an
agency
of
the
state
necessarily,
that
maybe
it.
i
was
going
to
call
attention
to
that,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
the
--
the
commission
issued
some
orders
with
respect
to
the
operation
of
the
illinois
central
railroad
going
through
the
state.
the
illinois
central
didn't
like
some
of
those
orders,
so
they
began
a
suit
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
the
commission's
orders.
and
there,
the
defense
was
made
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
and
since
this
is
one
of
the
--
probably,
the
only
case
on
it,
i'll
read
just
a
couple
of
lines
from
it
if
i
may.
“we
are
met
at
the
threshold
of
the
case
with
the
proposition
that
this
suit
is
forbidden
by
the
eleventh
amendment
that
it
is
in
effect
a
suit
against
the
state
by
a
citizen
of
another
state.
the
constitution,
with
its
amendments,
is
construed
as
one
instrument
and
the
eleventh
amendment
cannot
be
applied
to
nullify
the
power
conferred
on
congress
to
regulate
commerce
among
the
several
states."
now,
when
this
court
affirmed,
it
apparently
did
so,
on
the
ground
that
this
suit
had
not
been
against
the
state.
now
--
mr.
burke
williamson
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
if
he
was
suing
in
the
california
state
court,
he
could
at
the
present
time
do
so
under
a
statute
--
mr.
burke
williamson
no.
but
let's
assume
that
this
comes
out
of
one
of
these
cases
in
the
adjustment
board.
let's
assume
that
an
employee,
some
of
the
five
who
were
here
represented
by
me
are
--
are
successful
and
get
a
judgment
or
get
an
award
as
it's
called
in
the
adjustment
board
for
several
hundred
dollars
against
the
state
of
california
and
california
says,
“we
won't
comply.”
we
then
would
be
permitted
under
the
railway
labor
act
and
this
is
the
only
thing
we
could
do
under
the
railway
labor
act
to
start
a
suit
in
a
federal
district
court
on
the
award.
and
so,
we
would
have
squarely
the
question
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
puts
to
us
now.
is
that
a
suit
against
the
state
which
is
forbidden
by
the
eleventh
amendment?
that
brings
up
the
very
question
as
we
see
it
that
the
--
it
was
involved
in
the
mississippi
decision
and
that's
the
relation
of
the
eleventh
amendment
to
the
commerce
clause.
now,
article
i,
section
8
of
the
constitution
gives
to
the
congress
the
right
to
regulate
interstate
commerce.
on
the
other
hand,
here
is
the
eleventh
amendment
which
says
that
suits
cannot
be
started
against
the
state.
but
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
this
court
has
many,
many
times
interpreted
the
eleventh
amendment,
i
think,
not
perhaps
in
this
identical
situation.
but
many
times,
there
has
been
an
interpretation
by
this
court
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
the
trend
of
those
decisions,
it
seems
to
us,
is
to
make
the
states
and
their
agencies
more
responsible.
specifically,
if
the
state
has
been
guilty
of
some
tortuous
conduct
in
the
operation
of
a
proprietary
function,
it's
liable.
and
many
decisions
of
this
court
have
upheld
that
liability.
if
some
state
officer
is
threatening
an
illegal
act
and
suit
maybe
brought
against
him
and
the
eleventh
amendment
is
no
bar.
now,
possibly,
it
would
be
said
that
if
the
state
officer
is
acting
or
threatening
to
act
tortuously,
it
isn't
a
suit
against
the
state.
on
the
other
hand,
the
recent
decisions
of
this
court
have
established
the
liability
of
all
federal
--
not
all,
but
at
least
40
federal
corporations,
to
suits
in
spite
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
it
seems
to
the
respondents
that
when
a
state
chooses
to
go
in
to
the
railroad
business,
it
makes
itself
like
other
employers.
the
operation
of
the
railroad
is
not
one
of
the
typical
governmental
functions
in
which
--
with
which
we
were
concerned
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
or
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
mr.
burke
williamson
yes,
sir.
mr.
burke
williamson
they
do,
sir.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
where
the
respondents
were
successful,
there
was
an
attempt
made
after
the
case
had
been
argued
and
decided
to
bring
in
that
question,
as
i
understand
it.
and
when
this
court
granted
or
at
--
in
connection
with
the
petition
for
certiorari,
that
point
was
waived
by
the
state
of
california
so
that,
i
believe,
it's
--
it's
no
longer
here.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
if
this
court
holds,
sir,
that
the
railway
labor
act
applies
to
the
state
belt
railroad,
then
under
my
view,
all
california
law
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
application
of
the
railway
labor
act
to
the
operation
of
this
road
would
be
void
anyway.
we
have
a
contract
that's
already
been
made
that
the
only
question
is,
will
that
--
is
that
contract
valid?
i
think
it
undoubtedly
is
if
the
railway
labor
act
is
made
applicable.
mr.
burke
williamson
that
is
our
view.
it
was
made
under
the
railway
labor
act.
we
think,
therefore,
it's
under
federal
law.
mr.
burke
williamson
well,
i
think
it
was
made
under
the
railway
labor
act
because
i
don't
believe
the
railway
labor
act
forces
the
--
the
parties
to
enter
into
an
agreement.
it
strongly
encourages
them
to,
but
i
don't
believe
that
they
are
coerced
into
doing
so.
it's
been
suggested
that
there
are
only
11
railroads
which
are
in
question
here.
actually,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
there
are
30.
it
may
be
that
mr.
wineg
has
in
mind
that
out
of
the
30,
only
11
are
actually
operated
by
the
state
and
the
others
were
subject
to
lease.
but
we
think
that
the
legal
principles
are
the
same.
we're
talking
about
30
railroads,
not
11.
mr.
burke
williamson
i
don't
believe
they
are.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
i
understand
the
brief
correctly
in
the
way
they
operate,
mr.
justice
douglas,
they
meet
with
officials
of
the
state
and
urge
that
this
be
done
or
that
be
done.
and
then,
i
think
california
in
a
ex
parte
manner
hands
down
the
terms
under
which
the
employees
are
to
work.
i
don't
believe
it
would
be
called
collective-bargaining.
as
we
point
out
in
--
in
our
brief,
collective-bargaining
means
free
and
open
exchange
of
ideas
between
parties
who
have
the
authority
to
come
to
an
agreement
and
the
ex-parte
method
or
procedure
which
california
wishes
to
have
here
is
the
very
antithesis,
we
think
of
the
collective-bargaining
required
under
the
railway
labor
act.
thank
you,
sir.
