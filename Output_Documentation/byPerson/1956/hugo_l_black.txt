justice
black
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
this
violate
the
--
violates
the
literal
language
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause?
justice
black
yes.
justice
black
but
did
he
get
that
relevance
in
connection
with
the
ground
in
federal
court?
justice
black
do
you
think
that
language
has?
do
you
think
if
we
are
to
consider
the
amendments
and
the
provisions
to
safeguard
people
that
has
--
have
an
expressed
meaning
in
the
constitution
by
deluding
him
according
to
our
idea
of
what's
just
and
right
in
these
federal
cases?
well,
that
will
--
may
be
the
rule
now
in
reference
to
state
cases?
justice
black
but
why
was
that
too
much?
you
thought
we
could
measure
the
meaning
of
--
of
the
amendment
if
we
--
you
put
it
well
what
it
meant
by
what
you've
just
read
there
from
--
justice
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
black
have
you
considered
the
admissibility
of
that
evidence
in
the
light
of
graham
against
the
united
states?
justice
black
what
do
you
think
about
that?
justice
black
but
there
wasn't
much
confession
in
graham,
was
it?
that's
the
--
his
statements
were
exculpatory
to
me.as
i
recall
from
my
just
looking
at
the
beginning.
justice
black
well,
they
were
conflicting,
wasn't
it?
of
course
they
were
conflicting
--
he
conflict
--
he
conflicted
with
himself.
justice
black
is
that
right?
justice
black
so,
your
answer
then
is
that
he
voluntarily
repeated
the
statement
on
the
stand,
was
that
before
the
evidence
has
been
offered
against
him
or
after
it?
justice
black
well,
that
wouldn't
--
that
wouldn't
quite
answer
it,
wouldn't
it?
if
it
comes
down
to
the
graham
rule,
how
a
statement
made
shortly
afterwards
to
a
man
and
officers
while
he
was
incarcerated
--
justice
black
--
although
it
was
not
strictly
a
full
confession.
maybe
graham
is
no
longer
good
law
but
i
rather
call
it
superb.
justice
black
he
was
lying,
you
--
you
don't
know
just
--
makes
it
into
the
last
thing
we
missed
now,
do
you,
even
if
it
was
exculpatory,
the
government
used
it.
and
in
the
graham
case,
the
court
said
that
several
indictments
--
just
want
to
--
having
an
offer
to
his
confession
as
being
admissible
only
because
of
that
fact,
the
considerations
and
measure
of
proof
which
resulted
from
it
does
not
arrive
in
determining
admissibility.
and
he
says,
it
was
a
direct
declaration
but
the
state
used
to
procure
conviction,
not
for
the
state
to
say
the
declaration
did
not
prejudice
of
course
for
the
case.
i
don't
see
where
the
fact
if
it's
exculpatory
--
justice
black
--
for
fixing
a
problem.
justice
black
so
that's
why
you're
talking
merely
about
detention.
you're
talking
here
about
whether
or
not
this
volunteer
was
in
the
idea
of
the
fifth
amendment,
that's
what
graham
is.
justice
black
have
you
in
your
investigation
found
any
challenge
in
this
court
other
than
that
for
the
whole
kepner
holding,
has
this
court
emphasized
on
the
way
it
decided
--
justice
black
if
the
government
could
appeal
(inaudible)
and
do
you
know
of
any
such
case
this
court
has
ever
dealt.
justice
black
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
black
what
was
the
kepner
case
where
mr.
justice
holmes
wanted
that
the
government
could
be
and
that
it
hasn't--
justice
black
suppose
they
had
and
would
as
you
would
charge
them
the
defendant
guilty
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
(inaudible)
find
the
defendant
not
guilty
of
murder
in
the
first
degree,
re-review
find
the
guilty
of
murder
in
the
second
degree.
can
you
think
there
is
any
difference
in
the
constitution
(inaudible)
justice
black
(inaudible)
where
a
jury
had
chance
to
convict
of
two,
but
convicts
of
one
but
does
not
convict
of
the
other
--
justice
black
you
mean
by
that
if
they
had
â€“
if
that
conviction
of
second
degree
murder,
the
court
was
wrong
in
submitting
second
degree
murder
to
him,
but
he
wasn't
wrong
in
submitting
first
degree
murder
and
they
did
what
i
would
suppose
on
the
constitutional
level
(inaudible).
then
the
court
comes
along
and
grants
him
a
rebuttal
on
the
second
degree
murder
charge.
what's
the
difference
in
this
case
and
one
(inaudible)
they
returned
the
verdict
they
we
the
jury
find
the
defendant
not
guilty
of
murder
in
the
first
degree?
justice
black
but
you're
doing
this
on
the
basis
that
it
would
have
to
be
equivalent
of
verdict
of
acquittal
for
murder
in
the
first
degree,
what's
wrong
with
that
(inaudible)
justice
black
in
other
words
what
you
go
back
to
(inaudible)
they
find
murder
in
first
degree,
second
degree,
manslaughter
(inaudible)
they
can
try
him
and
use
the
murder
in
the
first
degree.
justice
black
you're
saying
is
we
ought
to
accept
trono
as
holding
in
part
(inaudible)
justice
black
have
you
looked
up
the
cases
(inaudible)
justice
black
--
states
that
they
charged
murder
in
the
first
degree
and
they
permit
conviction
all
the
way
down
to
assault
and
battery.
is
there
anything
in
your
brief
that
could
give
us
information
on
what
is
practically
stated
with
reference
to
pleading
the
silence
of
the
upper
benches
as
exactly
equivalent
of
a
federal?
justice
black
have
you
--
have
you
had
any
cases
in
your
brief
that
indicates
that
that
is
rationalization
to
--
to
call
it
jeopardy
for
the
lesser
offence?
i
had
supposed.
justice
black
maybe
i'm
wrong,
the
reason
why
that
he
had
been
acquitted
of
a
greater
offense
and
he
could
not
again
be
tried
to
that
offense.
justice
black
suppose
he's
been
indicted
for
larceny,
burglary
and
arson?
you
found
him
guilty
of
arson
and
he
said
nothing
about
it,
the
other
two.
he
appealed
his
arson
case.
could
they
try
him
for
the
others?
justice
black
three
charges
in
the
indictment,
one
burglary,
one
grand
larceny,
one
arson.
the
jury
brings
in
the
verdict
and
finds
him
guilty
of
arson.
the
court
charged
him
and
they
can
find
him
guilty
of
all
three.
he
appeals
the
argument.
what
happens
with
the
other
two
cases?
justice
black
but
is
it
not
true
of
that
separate
charges
where
they
had
one
count?
justice
black
what
case
holds
if
that's
not
the
case?
if
that's
not
--
that
that
is
what
she
said.
what
case
holds
that
if
one
count
charges
three
offenses
that
reversal
of
conviction
on
one
to
be
treated
differently
on
a
case
where
they
charge
it
in
three
separate
counts?
justice
black
--
right
to
form
of
jeopardy
would
depend
all
together
on
whether
the
prosecuting
attorney
put
it
in
three
counts
or
one.
justice
black
why
do
you
--
why
do
you
answer
to
it
hurriedly
that
that's
impossible
to
conceive.have
you
looked
that
up
in
the
book?
justice
black
the
combination
of
those
in
one
indictment
or
in
one
count.
justice
black
do
you
find
anything
in
trono
that
says
that?
i
find
four
(inaudible)
read
to
what
you
are
arguing
and
no
more
one
case
(inaudible)
do
you
find
any
words
or
any
language
in
the
trono
case
or
anything
to
define
justice
agreement
that
this
was
all
together
of
course
on
the
basis
of
the
bill
of
rights?
justice
black
yes.
justice
black
in
what
decision?
justice
black
can
it
be
said
that
there
were
four
--
more
than
four
who
did
accept
the
limited
waiver
doctrine?
justice
black
can
you
say
that
holmes
did
it?
justice
black
rejected
the
limited
waiver
doctrine?
justice
black
that's
right.
justice
black
then
you
have
four
people
who
agreed
to
the
basis,
to
that
one
same
basis
of
the
trono
case.
that
was
of
limited
waiver.
you
have
anymore?
justice
black
and
you
have,
do
you
not,
five
justices
in
the
trono
case
who
rejected
the
opinion
upon
which
you
so
heavily
relied
based
on
limited
waiver?
justice
black
is
that
not
correct?
holmes
did
it
in
kepner
and
the
others
did
it
there.
is
that
not
right?
justice
black
i'm
not
talking
about
quantitative.
i'm
talking
about
the
opinion
on
which
you
rely
that's
written
by
justice
peckham.
he
went
on
a
doctrine
that
a
man
who
appealed
once
of
one
conviction,
waived
his
rights
for
trial,
acquittal
on
another.
justice
black
that
was
it
and
there
were
only
--
is
not
true
that
there
were
four
only
to
back
that
opinion,
would
you
say
this
court
now
has
to
follow
on
the
basis
on
which
it
would
put?
justice
black
mr.
justice
holmes,
may
i
say
one
further
on
that?
now,
according
to
my
understanding,
he
rejected
the
bases
of
the
four
and
you
do
have
a
decision
by
the
court
in
which
there
were
five
who
joined
on
two
different
grounds.
now,
this
court
under
the
rule
as
i
understand
it,
according
to
what
is
followed
--
when
it
finally
decided
that
question
again,
each
five,
either
on
one
or
both
of
them
and
they
have
no
--
no
files
in
the
majority
that
has
evidence
on
either
of
those
grounds
separately
that
a
former
jeopardy
cannot
be
treated
here,
have
they?
is
there
any
opinion
by
five
members
of
this
court
which
you
can
point,
which
holds
that
this
man
free
of
former
jeopardy
is
barred
on
one
of
those
two
grounds?
justice
black
are
you
talking
about
the
georgia
case
under
the
state
law
(voice
overlap)
justice
black
what
was
the
case?
justice
black
what
was
the
decision
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
black
we
are
told
we
should
look
at
the
decision.
what
was
the
decision?
justice
black
who
appealed
his
trial?
who
appeal
his
trial?
justice
black
who
appealed
the
stroud
case
that
you're
talking
about?
justice
black
the
defendant.
justice
black
and
do
you
--
did
you
accept
the
suggestions
that
(inaudible)
case?
