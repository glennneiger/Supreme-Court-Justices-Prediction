service,
petitioner
versus
guiseppe
catalanotte.
mr.
fisher,
before
you
get
in
--
into
the
details
of
that
case,
would
you
mind
commenting
on
--
on
that
last
sentence
in
your
--
in
your
reply
brief
and
the
section
of
the
law
that
mr.
carliner
just
referred
to
where
you
say,
“and
the
aliens
abroad
could
even
claim
the
preservation
of
a
status
of
admissibility”?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
now
proceed
with
the
other
matter
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
get
that
last
inference
of
yours.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fisher,
do
you
have
any
idea
how
many
cases
of
this
kind
the
department
has
initiated?
chief
justice
earl
warren
a
small
number
amazes
me.
there
must
be
thousands
and
thousands
of
--
of
cases
where
under
your
theory
they
would
be
eligible
for
deportation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
mean
--
do
you
mean
they
would
use
this
just
for
special
cases
and
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
all
those
who
come
in
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hopping.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fisher,
bearing
upon
the
question
of
what
is
status
and
what
is
not
status?
suppose
the
government
took
off
that
five-year
limitation
on
--
on
deportability
when
the
person
comes
in
illegally,
would
they
be
depriving
into
the
status?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
i'd
like
to
know
if
you
consider,
consider
status?
let's
say
in
this
case,
if
they
took
off
the
five-year
limitation
that
was
in
the
other
act,
and
the
government
sought
to
deport
this
man
because
he
had
come
in
illegally
32
years
ago.
would
he
have
acquired
the
status
that
would
have
protected
that
this
act
could
have
protected
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
is
the
status
then
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
these
cases
that
you
said.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
the
bill
of
congress
a
bill?
chief
justice
earl
warren
a
finding
of
nondeportability?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
--
why
do
you
--
wherein
do
you
make
the
distinction?
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
--
