mr.
roger
d.
fisher
yes,
your
honor,
i'd
be
pleased
too.
the
statute
contains
as
mr.
carliner
just
pointed
out,
a
specific
provision
that
aliens
who
have
received
an
immigrant
visa
shall
be
governed
by
the
former
law.
as
mr.
carliner
suggests
that
the
savings
clause
be
construed
that
every
alien
in
the
world
by
or
gather
his
instructions
has
a
--
his
admissibility
status
shall
be
determined
by
the
law
at
the
time
whatever
he
did
when
he
was
born,
when
he
would
lived,
whatever
the
prior
law
was.
this
would
mean
that
all
the
provisions
of
the
1952
act
would
have
prospective
effect
only
as
to
persons,
aliens
not
yet
born
who
presumably
had
not
status
of
admissibility
under
the
old
law,
that
if
any
new
--
any
change
that
was
made
between
prior
grounds
and
new
grounds,
and
a
new
statute
could
not
affect
any
living
alien
because
in
his
view,
an
alien
who
was
admissible
under
the
old
law
of
that
status
which
would
continue.
i
believe
that
the
expressed
provisions,
which
he
called
your
honors
attention
does
apply
to
aliens
who
have
filed,
who
have
immigrant
visa,
it
does
not
apply
to
aliens
in
general.
that
if
--
i'm
turning
it
to
a
former
case
which
is
the
carson
case.
if
he
has
had
his
status
adjusted,
if
he
had
had
something
which
made
him
non
deportable,
which
is
valid
of
the
new
law,
the
new
law
would
apply
and
he'd
be
nondeportable.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
thank
you,
if
it
please
the
court.
number
435,
regarding
mr.
--
the
respondent,
catalanotte,
it's
the
second
of
the
two
cases
we
start
talking
about
yesterday
and
raises
the
same
question
of
retroactivity
of
the
deportation
provisions.
respondent
catalonotte
entered
the
country
in
1920
from
italy.
he,
at
no
time
became
naturalized
or
had
any
--
took
any
steps
toward
becoming
american
citizen.
deportation
proceedings
were
began
in
1953
on
two
grounds,
a
narcotics
conviction
in
1952,
and
a
conviction
of
two
offenses
involving
moral
turpitude,
a
1924
conviction
and
1934
conviction,
as
proceeding
in
stolen
property
and
malicious
threats
to
extort.
while
the
proceedings
were
pending,
the
1952
narcotics
conviction
was
reversed
on
appeal,
the
arraigning
ground
with
the
two
prior
crimes
involving
moral
turpitude.
respondent
succeeded
in
having
the
1924
and
the
detroit
court
opened
up
the
1924
case,
changed
his
plea
to
not
guilty
and
dismissed
the
1924
conviction.
the
immigration
service
then
filed
a
charge,
which
is
the
sole
basis
for
the
present
in
the
case
at
this
time.
this
was
a
conviction
in
1925
of
a
narcotics
violation.
it's
the
violation
of
the
act
of
1914,
which
was
not
a
deportable
offense
in
1925.
and
if
i
may
come
back
to
yesterday
on
the
narcotics
offenses,
some
narcotics
violations
were
deportable
offenses
in
certain
federal
step
--
first,
to
a
certain
one
federal
statute
than
it
was
a
certain
federal
statute
and
the
present
act
makes
any
violation
of
any
narcotics
law
a
deportable
offense.
the
special
inquiry
officer
in
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
both
found
respondent
deportable.
so,
a
habeas
corpus
where
as
the
district
court
denied,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
ordered
the
respondent
discharged.
the
government
sought
certiorari
to
which
this
court
granted.
this
is
--
it
comes
up
from
the
sixth
circuit
of
the
same
court,
which
decided
the
carson
case.
the
sole
question
in
issue
is
whether
the
provisions
of
section
241,
here
specifically
241
(a)
(11)
relating
to
prior
convictions
for
narcotics
shall
be
governed
--
where
the
deportability
should
be
governed
for
narcotics
conviction,
should
be
governed
by
the
new
law
or
by
the
old
law.
listening
to
respondent
in
the
previous
case,
he
seems
to
imply
that
the
--
both
the
language
can
reasonably
be
read.
the
language
of
statute
may
reasonably
be
read
to
apply
only
to
future
convictions
of
narcotics.
the
new
law
does
not
apply
to
make
anyone
deportable
who
was
not
deportable
before.
it
seems
to
imply
and
the
legislative
history
supports
that
construction.
i
believe
he
is
grossly
wrong
on
both
counts
as
i'll
try
and
demonstrate
to
the
court.
he
referred
--
he
talked
about
numbers
of
sections
of
the
act
to
respondent's
counsel,
but
not
in
sections
particularly
here
involved.
the
question
is
--
it
relates
to
241.
i
was
glad
to
hear
mr.
carliner
say,
“there
need
not
be
a
stated
exception
to
the
--
to
the
savings
clause,
just
something
that
indicates
strong
congressional
intent
that
the
new
policy
shall
apply
notwithstanding
the
general
policy
in
favor
of
preservation
and
status
quo.”
i
would
like
to
look
in
the
--
invite
the
court's
attention
to
the
language
of
241
(d)
and
the
language
of
241
(a)
(11).
this
appears
on
pages
89,
85
in
the
back
of
the
government's
reply
brief.
241
(d)
says,
“except
as
otherwise
specifically
provided
in
this
section.”
in
looking
for
the
standard
of
what
is
required
by
otherwise
specifically
provided,
i
would
take
what
the
standard
that
respondent
here
has
suggested.
in
241
(d),
the
phrase,
“otherwise
specifically
provided”
is
met
in
respondent
to
carson's
view
by
the
language
hereafter,
which
appears
in
various
sections
of
241.
in
his
brief,
page
28,
he
concedes
that
wherever
the
word
“hereafter”
is
used,
it
takes
it
out
of
241
(d).
in
other
words,
the
word
hereafter,
standing
by
itself
is
a
clear
not
the
indication
of
a
contrary
congressional
policy
to
take
a
clause
out
of
a
requirement
that
it
must
be
specific,
otherwise,
specifically
provided.
now,
i
submit
that
if
otherwise,
if
the
word
hereafter
is
enough
to
take
the
first
sentence
of
11,
subsection
11
out
of
241
(d),
the
word
that
the
--
there'll
be
same
language
and
the
second
phrase,
“at
any
time”
is
enough
to
take
it
out
of
the
general
savings
clause
for
the
test
if
it's
identically
the
same,
unless
otherwise
specifically
provided.
now,
to
find
out
what
is
required,
what
we're
looking
for
--
i'd
like
to
refer
to
the
court's
language
in
the
shomberg
case
as
to
standard
to
be
laid
down
as
to
this
specific
savings
clause.
the
court
said
in
using
the
“notwithstanding”
language
in
these
sections,
congress
clearly
manifested
its
intent
that
certain
policies
should
override
the
otherwise
broad
and
pervasive
principle
of
the
savings
clause,
then
skipping
a
sentence,
“we
would
be
lax
in
our
duty
if
we
did
not
give
recognition,
also
the
congressional
purpose
to
override
the
savings
clause
when
other
considerations
were
thought
more
compelling
than
the
preservation
of
the
status
quo.”
we're
looking
in
241
now
for
a
manifestation
of
congressional
intent
that
something
should
overcome
the
status
quo.
looking
at
the
very
section
at
which
the
respondent,
catalanotte
in
this
case
is
charged,
the
language
which
appears
on
85,
reply
brief.
“an
alien
is
to
be
deported,
who
is
or
hereafter
at
anytime
after
entry
has
been
a
drug
addict.”
it
seems
to
me
a
clear
intent
that
the
“hereafter”
shows
that
this
new
law
as
to
addicts
is
not
to
apply
to
anyone
who
is
an
addict
prior
deduction
of
the
statute.
i
might
--
i
might
mention
the
medic
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
the
suggestion
as
of
the
first
clause
of
11
which
says
that
“aliens
should
be
deported
who
is
or
hereafter
anytime
after
entry
has
been
a
narcotic
drug
addict.”
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
it
shows
a
clear
intent
that
as
to
addicts,
as
to
those
who
have
been
drug
addicts,
the
new
grounds
of
deportability
shall
only
apply
to
persons
who
hereafter
have
been
addicts.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
is
--
yes,
is
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
right,
right
is
at
the
time.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
accept
the
correction,
anyone
who
is
at
the
time
of
the
adaption
of
the
statute
of
addict
or
thereafter
starts
bingo
and
goes
on
prospectively.
now,
contrasted
immediately
following
language
or
who
at
anytime
has
been
convicted
of
a
violation
of
any
law
or
regulation
related
to
the
illicit
traffic
in
narcotic
drugs.
respondent,
catalanotte,
has
concededly
been
convicted
at
anytime
of
a
crime
relating
--
convicted
in
1925
of
a
crime
relating
for
traffic
in
narcotic
drugs.
i
--
you
cannot
read
those
two
phrases
which
immediately
follow
each
other,
and
which
in
the
course
of
the
legislative
history
started
out
to
say,
“anyone
who
has
been
convicted,”
then
it
was
said,
“any
--
anyone
who
is
or
anytime
after
entry
is
been
an
addict.”
“and
then,
the
final
draft,
the
word
“hereafter”,
was
inserted
as
to
addicts
and
was
not
inserted
as
to
those
who've
been
convicted
on
narcotics
offenses.
now,
addicts
were
not
deportable
prior
to
this
act.
those
who'd
been
convicted
of
violations
of
some
federal
statutes
were
similarly
not
deportable.
it
depended
on
which
act
you
had
violated.
this
said,
“anyone
who
at
any
time
has
been
convicted
of
a
violation
of
any
law
or
regulation
relating
to
the
elicit
traffic
narcotic
drugs.”
i
fail
to
see
how
you
could
have
a
more
specific
manifestation
of
intent
on
the
phase
of
the
very
section,
but
congress
thought
that
might
not
be
enough.
so,
in
241
(d),
they
put
some
more
language
in.
i've
said
there
are
several
things
in
241
(d)
which
demonstrate
conclusively
that
this
is
to
be
a
specific
provision
that
shows
a
conclusive,
congressional
intent
that
prior
--
that
events
were
to
be
governed
by
this
law,
not
by
prior
law.
first,
except
as
otherwise
specifically
provided
in
this
section,
a
clear
recognition
by
congress
that
the
rules
into
this
section
are
different
as
they
are
from
two
other
parts
of
the
act.
this
section
has
a
different
policy
unless
it's
provided
differently
in
this
section,
these
facts
shall
apply.
that
language
is
ignored
and
i
submit
it
cannot
be
--
it
must
be
deleted
from
the
act
if
respondent's
construction
was
adopted.
you
have
to
pretend
it's
not
there.
then,
it
goes
on
to
say,
“except
as
other
--“
i'm
reading
starting
over
again,
“except
as
otherwise
specifically
provided
in
this
section,
the
provisions
of
this
section
shall
be
applicable
to
all
aliens
belonging
to
any
of
the
classes
enumerated
in
subsection
(a).”
how
more
complete
could
you
be?
they
went
on.
“they
shall
be
applicable
notwithstanding
that
any
such
alien
enter
the
united
states
prior
to
be
of
an
enactment
or
the
facts.”
and
again,
i'm
putting
"notwithstanding”
over
too,
“not
withstanding
that
the
facts
by
reason
of
which
he
belongs
to
those
classes
enumerated
occurred
prior
to
the
date
of
the
enactment
of
this
act.”
this
is
recognition
that
there's
a
general
policy
that
you
don't
govern
acts
by
a
law
now
adopted.
it's
a
recognition
that
this
section
shall
apply
notwithstanding
that
provision.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
yes,
your
honor,
i've
checked
that
by
telegram
last
week
with
all
the
field
officers
of
the
service
and
there
are
108
pending
deportation
cases
at
any
stage
in
the
administrative
process
of
which
they
know
where
the
retroactive
feature
of
section
--
of
241,
that's
all
700
clauses
of
section
241.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i'll
try
to
find
out
i
was
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
was
surprised
but
i'll
try
to
find
out.
the
answer
appears
to
be
that
most
persons
who
came
in
illegally,
originally
which
is
the
category
of
one
--
one
of
the
categories
that
carson
came
in
under.
after
1924,
they
were
all
allowed
to
adjust
their
status
and
have
a
--
on
a
registry
proceedings
to
say
they've
come
in
legally
if
they
were
of
good
moral
character
and
so
forth,
and
most
everybody
did.
the
--
there
are
comparatively
small
number
of
cases.
also,
i
believe
they
have
not
gone
through
the
general
--
alien
registration
cards
to
find
out
everything.
these
cases
are
--
cases
they
know
about,
or
their
cases
of
persons
who
have
been
incarcerated
and
they
have
a
system
of
letting
the
immigration
service
know
when
they
get
out
of
jail.
if
an
alien
is
about
to
be
released
from
a
narcotics
offense
may
not
be
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
no,
they
were
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
they're
going
after
every
case
they
know
about
that
they
have
not,
i
say
taken
every
alien
in
the
united
states
and
then
investigated
to
see
whether
--
no,
they've
conducted
a
--
an
fbi
type
of
investigation
in
all
the
aliens
if
not
in
that.
this
is
being
applied
across
the
board
as
the
immigration
services
vested
their
ability
of
doing
it,
and
they've
come
up
--
since
1952,
i've
met
currently
108
cases.
the
--
i
would
like
to
mention
that
in
the
wong
case,
(inaudible)
case
referred
to
in
page
19
of
our
brief,
judge
edgerton
picked
this
section
241
(d)
as
the
single
and
presumably,
the
best
example
he
could
find
if
otherwise
specifically
provided.
in
finding
that
in
other
clause,
he'd
say,
“do
you
think
this
was
specific,”
he
said,
unless
you
compared
it
with
what
congress
meant
when
they
really
were
specific
as
in
241
(d).
his
--
his
general
concern
for
the
lot
of
aliens
knows
in
his
selection
of
this
clause
was
an
example
of
what
was
specifically
provided.
i
think
it
shows
a
good
deal.
now,
what
happened
to
this
language
under
respondent's
construction?
you
cannot
make
it
fit.
perhaps,
this
is
why
counsel
devoted
at
little
attention
to
the
wording
of
the
statute
as
he
did.
the
language
just
doesn't
fit.
he
says,
“oh,
the
statute
is
retroactive,
all
right.
it
just
doesn't
apply.”
the
new
law,
if
i
may
read
it,
we
admit
that
to
the
court
below
that
some
provisions
are
retroactive,
others
are
not.
however,
we
do
not
reach
the
retroactive
provisions
of
the
new
law
unless
the
new
law
applies.
now,
under
his
definition,
it's
like
you
can
go
swimming
but
don't
go
near
the
water.
the
new
law
applies,
except
whatever
would
be
applicable
doesn't
apply.
wherever
there's
a
slightest
change
that
the
old
law
applies.
the
--
if
anyone's
intent
had
to
been
to
carry
forward
what
--
meaning
that
old
conducts
should
be
governed
by
old
law,
they
would
not
have
said,
“except
as
otherwise
provided
in
this
section.
the
provisions
of
this
section
shall
be
applicable
to
aliens
for
higher
conduct
if
facts
had
occurred
prior
to
his
adoption.”
he
--
if
by
his
construction
eliminates
at
any
retroactive
feature
of
a
statute,
of
the
deportation
provisions,
and
then
said,
“it's
retroactive
but
it
doesn't
apply.”
i
--
the
language
is
--
what
--
what
you
do
with
the,
“except
as
otherwise
provided
in
this
section.”
what
do
you
do
with
the
language
in
241
(a)
(11)
dealing
with
narcotics
offenses
and
the
contrast
between
hereafter
as
to
addicts
and
that
anytime
as
to
persons
who
have
been
convicted
with
narcotic
offenses?
the
whole
section
as
i
suggested
yesterday
might
just
as
well
have
began
hereafter.
and
all
these
careful
wording
as
to
which
offense
had
occurred
when
would
have
been
left
out.but
perhaps,
if
the
general
saving
statute
was
not
being
adequate
if
we
think
it
is
and
perhaps
if
the
respondent's
construction
of
the
--
if
this
savings
act
step
clause
was
not
adequate,
they
might
have
a
special
clause
saving
persons
deportable
under
--
prior
offenses
shall
remain
deportable.
that's
not
what
this
language
says
and
it's
unusual
to
believe
that
in
using
this
explicit
language
which
cannot
be
reconciled
to
that
position,
that's
all
congress
intended.
now,
i
take
one
more
section,
which
i
think
illustrates
as
clearly
than
anything
else,
if
congress
intended
these
provisions
to
be
specific
exceptions
to
the
savings
clause
and
to
be
retroactive.
section
17,
subsection
17
says,
attorney
general
to
deport
anyone
who
we
find
to
be
undesirable
etcetera,
etcetera
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
he
has
been
convicted
of,”
and
that
lists
a
series
of
statute.
this
appears
on
pages
86
and
87.
let
me
take
one
example
from
87,
grounds
for
present
deportation
of
the
new
act
shall
be
a
violation,
a
conviction
of
violation
of
the
selective
training
and
service
act
of
1940.
that
act
was
in
effect
between
1940
and
1947.
it
was
not
a
deportable
offense
at
the
time
the
act
is
in
effect.
anyone
convicted
of
violation
of
that
act
could
not
have
been
deported
for
--
prior
to
this
statute.
and
yet,
the
statute
of
limitations
on
prosecutions
of
that
act
had
also
expired,
so
that
we're
--
we're
faced
with
the
fact
that
congress
saying,
“a
person
shall
be
deported,
if
the
--
if
he
is
found
to
be
undesirable
by
reason
of
having
been
convicted
of
the
selected
violation
of
a
selective
training
and
service
act
of
1940.”
under
respondent's
theory,
this
section,
the
specific
provision
could
never
apply.
anyone
who
commit
a
violation
will
have
a
nondeportable
status
unless
he
could
not
use
--
he
could
not
be
deported
under
this
language.
i
submit
the
wording
of
the
statute
does
not
fit
respondent's
construction.
the
language
manifests
a
clear
congressional
intent
that
the
new
law
should
be
applied
to
prior
events.
now,
does
the
legislative
history
show
anything
to
the
contrary?
i
heard
some
of
yesterday's
argument
in
the
preceding
case
where
you're
considering
the
hearings
of
a
(inaudible)
laborer
convention
--
what
they
have
said
to
interpret
what
they
have
requested,
what
--
interpret
what
the
committee
have
proposed,
interpret
what
the
congress
have
enacted.
fortunately,
we're
not
faced
with
any
such
problem
here.
we
have
the
views
of
the
government,
stated
to
congress
as
to
what
the
act
meant.
we
have
the
views
of
the
congress
and
we
have
the
views
of
the
president,
the
views
of
this
court,
i
submit.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
your
honor.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
that
does
not
reconcile
them
all,
your
honor,
i
agree.
the
--
we
--
we
take
a
--
a
second
position
which
is
discussed
in
the
brief
that
a
person
in
his
position
has
no
status.
but
my
argument
as
to
241
(d),
it
does
not
help
the
government
as
to
private
bill
even
on
that.
we
say
a
private
bill
is
a
status,
and
i
think
it
is.
i
still
had
to
come
back
and
meet
my
own
point,
but
241
(d)
is
the
specific
provision
of
the
deportability,
so
that
we
come
to,
if
not
whether
a
private
bill
confers
a
status.
in
my
view,
it's
not
the
controlling
question.
the
controlling
question
is
whether
241
(d)
specifically
provide
that
persons
who
have
done
things,
and
then
have
private
bills
shall
be
deported.
and
i
read
241
(d)
as
the
united
states
say
i
--
i'll
say
the
government
brief
241
(d)
has
meaning,
you
hold
the
standard
of
present
law
up
to
the
--
the
events.
just
exactly
what
the
language
of
the
statute
says?
and
i
think
the
facts
by
reason
of
which
any
such
alien
belongs
to
a
class,
not
withstanding
the
facts
occurred
prior
that
they
--
of
its
enactment
and
i
say
notwithstanding
the
facts
by
reason
of
which
any
alien
belongs
or
does
not
belong
to
such
a
class
occurred
prior
to
the
date.
this,
we
take
anything
before
it
happened,
whether
it's
a
private
bill,
a
suspension
of
deportation
or
adjustment
of
status.
and
you
say,
“if
all
those
events
had
occurred
under
the
new
law,
would
he
be
deportable?”
clearly
not.
i
might
say
that's
to
prior
bill
the
case
has
come
up
and
the
attorney
general
has
ruled
that
he
cannot
be
deported.
the
issue
was
raised
and
that
he
had
a
ruling
on
it,
so
that
--
there's
no
question
of
our
going
back
and
holding
up,
ignoring
events
that
have
made
some
deportable
before.
i'll
save
the
doubts
in
my
time
if
i
may
for
rebuttal.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
if
they
took
it
off
the
plot,
after
man
--
the
five-years
test
period
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
the
words
that
i
would
say
in
one
sentence
yes,
in
this
405
it
says
no.
our
position
is
that
the
word
“status”
of
course
can
be
used
in
any
manner
of
meaning.
if
it's
construed
as
broadly
as
respondents
construe
it,
it
will
cover
everything
in
the
act
who
hardly
be
even
prospective
in
effect.
i
--
i
would
--
i
think
that
the
status
question
is
less
important
because
i
think
that
the
--
the
--
there
is
much
more
reason,
there's
not
much
to
go
on.
it's
not
much
--
the
word
“status”
was
put
in
when
the
section
concerned
only
naturalization,
and
persons
requiring
rights,
and
that's
when
the
word
is
put
in.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
there's
no
reconsideration
when
the
section
was
moved
five
sections
later.
two
or
three
specific
deportation
grounds
were
put
in,
nothing
relating
to
deportation
and
warrants
of
arrest.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
we
say
that
our
position
is
that
he
was
not,
that
even
within
--
because
that's
the
carson
--
first
ground
of
the
carson
case.
our
position
is
that
he
would
that
a
statute
of
limitations,
he
was
illegally
in
this
country
throughout
that
entire
period.
he
made
no
efforts
to
adjust
his
status
to
a
legal
entry.
he
could
--
he
was
illegally
here
in
1952
when
the
thing
was
on.
there
was
no
provision
requiring
to
deport
such
people.
congress
decided
that
persons
illegal
in
this
country,
still
here
illegally,
shall
now
be
deported.
i
think
that
being
here,
not
subject
to
certain
right
we
pushed
out
was
not
such
a
status.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
--
i
think
a
status
has
required
by
more
than
a
--
it
would
then
the
meaning
of
405.
it
must
be
an
affirmative
right
toward
citizenship,
toward
permanent
residence,
toward
something
above
absolute
zero.
there
must
be
some
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
a
bill
--
certainly
a
status,
but
a
suspension
of
deportation
of
status
that
you
have
permanent
residence
then.
i
would
concede
the
old
law
should
be
status.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
not
a
finding
under
what
the
old
law
was,
not
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
the
government
dropped
and
case
mr.
carson's
case
when
the
grounds
--
when
he
was
received
a
conditional
party.
he
should
be
no
more
better
off
than
that
when
somebody
as
to
whom
the
government
never
brought
a
case
who
had
a
conditional
party.
i
don't
think
that
the
--
the
change
should
make
any
difference,
but
whatever
the
court
do
should
be
on
status,
and
i
will
--
i
think
the
court
might
differ
with
me
on
that.
i
cannot
see
how
the
court
can
differ
as
to
the
construction
of
what
congress
intended
by
the
act
as
a
whole.
and
this
leads
--
it
reinforces
my
views
on
status.
if
congress
had
intended
status
to
protect
everybody
who
was
nondeportable,
they
would
not
throughout
the
legislative
history.
first,
the
immigration
service
stated
at
the
bill
to
the
two
congress
in
the
first
draft
of
bill.
this
of
course
gives
retroactive
effect
to
the
deportation
provisions
of
this
bill.
the
final
senate
--
senate
report
for
the
majority
mentioned
the
fact
that
it
was
retroactive
and
went
on
to
say,
“deportation
proceedings
are
not
similar
nature,
and
therefore
the
ex
post
facto
limitation
of
the
constitution
are
not
applicable
to
the
retroactive
features
of
this
provision.”
the
minority,
disagreeing
in
the
senate,
disagreed
because
of
the
very
reason,
which
the
chief
justice
has
referred
that
the
five-year
period
was
taken
off.
as
it
presently
stands,
they
said,
“the
statute
making
any
alien
who
failed
to
conform
to
all
applicable
laws
when
he
entered
the
united
states
deportable
forever
--
it
would
make
him
forever
deportable
to
the
language
of
the
minority
report
quoted
on
page
16
of
our
brief
in
number
72.
when
the
president
considered
the
bill
and
detailed
it,
he
said,”
defects
and
mistakes
in
admission
would
serve
to
deport
at
any
time
because
of
the
bill's
elimination
retroactively,
as
well
as
prospectively
of
the
present
humane
provision
barring
deportation
on
such
grounds
five
years
after
entry.”
when
that
was
passed
over
his
veto,
there
was
no
occasion
to
find
otherwise.
mr.
justice
clark
in
marcello
case,
speaking
for
the
court,
pointed
out
on
page
303
of
349
u.s.
that
these
provisions
make
such
conviction
at
any
time
the
italics
of
that
of
this
court
in
construing
this
section
of
the
act.
this
act
followed
the
1940
and
the
1950
act.
the
1940
alien
registration
act
was
retroactive.
the
1950
act
was
retroactive
and
we
submit
the
1952
act
using
the
same
language
in
a
relevant
provision
says
party
membership
is
retroactive,
and
the
court
should
reverse
these
two
cases.
