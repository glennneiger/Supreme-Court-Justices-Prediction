justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
i
understand
it,
from
the
discussion
yesterday,
you
would
agree
that
anyone
who
would
had
a
private
bill
or
who
would
had
some
affirmative
benefit
conferred
on
it
by
action
under
the
old
law
would
be
safe
from
the
application
of
this
act.
now,
what
i'm
wondering
is
this,
can
--
does
it
make
sense
to
say
that
the
savings
clause
405
applies
only
to
status
in
a
sense
that
the
status
was
something
that
was
conferred
by
action
under
the
old
law
and
that
it
does
not
apply
to
a
status
that
is
achieved
simply
by
the
absence
of
that
law
that
would
have
made
him
deportable.
does
that
reconcile
all
of
these
confusions?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
suppose
you
could
say
that
the
general
legislation
as
to
yield
with
the
specific
culture.
justice
john
m.
harlan
under
your
construction
of
the
act
as
i
understand
it,
241
would
be
wholly
perspective.
it
couldn't
operate
except
the
perspective
of
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
appreciate
that,
but
is
it
not
a
consequence
in
your
position
that
you
have
to
read
as
you
read
the
act
241
as
being
wholly
perspective?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
whole
--
the
whole
damage
of
section
241,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
there
any
that
would?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
one
more
question?
before
405
(a)
was
extended
to
deportation,
was
your
man
have
been
deportable
under
241?
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
not
have.
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
was
a
period,
was
there
not
when
405
(a)
didn't
extend
the
deportation
cases?
it
was
limited
to
naturalization.
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
was
a
period
when
241
(a)
--
241
was
not
affected
so
far
as
deportation
is
concerned
by
405.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
what
i'm
asking
you
is
whether
at
that
period
that
this
case
come
up,
was
your
man
had
been
deportable?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
405
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
my
hypothesis
was
not
effective
because
it
would
apply
to
deportation.
justice
john
m.
harlan
he
would
have
been
deported.
