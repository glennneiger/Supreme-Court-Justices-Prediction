mr.
louis
m.
hopping
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
say
something
by
way
of
rebuttal
first
to
a
point
or
two,
which
mr.
fisher
has
been
making
just
now.
the
first
point
that
he
makes
that
i
want
to
say
something
about
is,
what
do
you
do
with
the
language
which
says,
“unless
otherwise
provided
in
this
section,
the
man
shall
be
deportable.”
well,
just
briefly,
i
will
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
savings
clause,
which
we
ask
the
court
to
consider
says,
“just
as
definitely,
nothing
contained
in
this
act
shall
affect
any
condition
or
status,”
so
that
those
things
would
balance
in
my
opinion.
the
second
point
that
he
made
that
i
want
to
refer
to
briefly
is
his
reference
to
the
selective
service
and
training
act
which
he
said
was
in
effect
from
1940
to
1947
and
for
violation
of
which
an
alien
would
not
be
deportable.
just
briefly,
i
consider
that
in
this
particular
reference,
the
solicitor
general
was
making
my
argument
that
i
was
making
in
the
early
stages
of
our
defense,
except
this.
he
must
also
establish
under
that
section
that
the
alien
in
that
case
is
presently
an
undesirable
person,
not
simply
convicted.
now,
the
third
point
that
i
want
to
cover
by
way
of
rebuttal
in
this
brief
refers
is
he
says,
“the
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
is
that
you
apply
the
standard
wholly
under
the
new
act,”
or
as
i
heard
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
yesterday,
“it
would
include
this
situation,
catalanotte
was
convicted
in
1925
of
a
violation
of
the
narcotic
act.”
that
makes
him
deportable
under
the
new
act.
i
can't
understand
yet
how
the
government
says
that
it
would
not
have
the
power
under
the
new
act
to
deport
catalanotte
even
though
he
had
had
a
special
bill
since
then,
because
he
is
still
convicted
under
that
act
which
is
the
sole
ground
of
deportation.
mr.
louis
m.
hopping
yes,
that
might
be
an
answer,
if
the
court
please.
but
so
far
as
the
language
is
concerned,
i
think
it
does
appear
that
way.
now,
in
our
brief,
we
have
said
that
the
court
of
appeals
followed
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
menasche
and
shomberg
and
that
we
rely
on
those
decisions.
briefly,
in
menasche,
we
would
say
it
follows
that
the
only
time
you
need
a
savings
clause
is
when
a
new
statute
attempts
to
take
away
an
advantage
which
an
alien
had
under
the
old
law.
that
would
be
the
only
time
you'd
need
to
ask
for
the
help
of
the
savings
clause,
and
we
do
ask
for
it.
i
would
like
to
explain
briefly
if
i
can
how
we
think
shomberg
applies
in
our
situation.
mr.
justice
clark,
in
delivering
the
opinion
of
the
court
stated
from
shomberg,
“the
precise
issue
in
this
proceeding
is
whether
petitioner
who
filed
his
petition
for
naturalization
two
days
before
the
effective
date
of
the
immigration
on
nationality
act
of
1952,
66
stat.163
and
so
forth,
may
compel
a
final
hearing
on
the
same
before
the
determintion
of
deportation
proceedings
instituted
after
the
effective
date
of
the
act
and
based
solely
on
grounds
initiated
by
that
act.”
section
318
quoted
on
a
footnote
at
page
541,
contains
the
phrase,
“notwithstanding
the
provisions
of
section
405
(b),”
i'm
jumping
a
little
bit.”
no
person
shall
be
naturalized
against
whom
there
is
outstanding
a
final
finding
of
deportability.”
this
raised
the
question
of
the
relationship
between
section
318
and
section
405.
in
catalanotte,
we
do
not
have
the
same
sections
involved
but
we
have
a
relationship
between
241
(a)
(11)
and
section
405.
the
court
said
at
page
542,
“petitioner
was
eligible
for
citizenship
under
the
prior
law
and
remains
eligible
under
the
new
act,
but
under
the
prior
law,
petitioner
was
not
deportable.”
the
court
held
at
page
543,
“that
section
318
specifically
accepts
rights
under
prior
law
from
protection
of
section
405
when
those
rights
stem
from
a
petition
for
naturalization
or
some
other
step
in
the
naturalization
process.”
and
right
here,
the
court
place
to
footnote
at
page
543,
“this
is
not
to
say
that
petitioner
cannot
challenge
the
authority
of
the
attorney
general
to
deport
him
under
section
241
(a)
of
the
1952
act,”
and
there
are
small
words
but
that's
the
pertinent
part
of
that.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
catalanotte
case
expressly
quoted
this
court's
opinion
in
shomberg
and
stated
among
other
things,
“it
was
held
in
shomberg
versus
united
states
348
u.s.
540
that
such
intent,”
meaning
the
intent
to
make
405
inapplicable
“is
clear
where
it
is
specifically
provided
that
a
provision
be
effective
'notwithstanding'
the
terms
of
a
savings
clause.”
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
sixth
circuit,
the
catalanotte
case
and
then
in
carson,
there
appended
a
footnote
to
its
decision,
calling
attention
to
the
analysis
of
this
court
at
page
547
of
this
court's
opinion
in
which
this
court
cited
five
instances
in
the
1952
act
in
which
congress
used
specific
language
of
that
exact
kind
using
the
word,
“notwithstanding
section
405
(b)
in
sections
311,
313
(a),
315
(a),
331
(d)
in
addition
to
section
318.”
the
court
of
appeals
then
said,
“there
is
no
such
clear
manifestation
of
intent
apparent
to
us
in
the
present
case
in
section
241
(a)
(11).”
they
quoted
their
opinion
in
carson
and
applied
it
to
catalanotte
as
well.
to
this
extent,
the
court
of
appeals
followed
the
shomberg
decision
and
the
manasche
decision
but
either
particular
reference
was
to
the
shomberg,
but
this
is
not
the
solely
authority
which
they
followed.
the
court
of
appeals
said
further.
“if
there
be
deemed
to
exist
any
reasonable
doubt
as
to
whether
congress
intended
to
make
an
alien
deportable,
that
doubt
should
be
resolved
in
his
favor,”
and
cited
fong
haw
tan
versus
phelan
in
333
u.s.,
at
6
and
10.
“if
two
conflicting
interpretations
of
the
deportation
statute,”
and
now
i'm
paraphrasing
that
holding
as
quoted
by
the
sixth
circuit,
and
i'd
like
to
add
a
parallel
word.
“if
two
conflicting
sections
are
inconsistent
and
one
must
yield
this
interpretation
or
parallel
to
the
section
which
seems
to
make
him
deportable
must
yield
to
the
one
which
clearly
says
he
is
not
deportable.”
i
cannot
find
in
the
solicitor
general's
briefs
any
place
where
he
takes
issue
with
the
authority
which
the
court
of
appeals
cited
in
that
connection.
may
i
recall
briefly
to
the
court
that
the
question
from
fong
haw
tan
case
was
the
interpretation
of
the
phrase
in
the
old
law,
“sentence
more
than
once.”
the
alien
there
was
charged
in
two
counts
with
murdering
two
men,
convicted
and
sentenced
in
one
--
in
one
judgment
to
life
imprisonment
upon
each
case.
mr.
justice
douglas,
delivering
the
opinion
for
a
unanimous
court
said
in
concluding
their
opinion,
“we
resolve
the
doubts
in
favor
of
that
construction
against
deportability,
because
deportation
is
a
drastic
measure
and
at
times
equivalent
to
banishment
or
exile,”
citing
delgadillo
versus
carmichael
332
u.s.
388.
“it
is
a
forfeiture
for
misconduct
of
a
residence
in
this
country.
such
a
forfeiture
is
a
penalty.
to
construe
this
statute
less
generously
to
the
alien
might
find
support
in
logic,
but
since
the
stakes
are
considerable
for
the
individual,
we
will
not
assume
that
congress
meant
to
trench
on
his
freedom
beyond
that
which
is
required
by
the
narrowest
of
several
possible
meanings
of
word
used.”
if
this
court
in
the
case
at
bar,
we'll
bear
in
mind
that
the
members
of
congress
who
voted
for
section
241
(a)
(11)
also
voted
at
the
same
time
for
section
405.
you
must
choose
which
one
is
the
controlling
section
if
they
are
conflicting.
now,
i'd
like
to
say
a
word
about
the
second
point
if
i
may.
if
a
status
exists,
it
is
immaterial
how
it
rises.
the
statute
itself
makes
no
distinction
in
one
status
or
another
because
of
the
manner
of
its
creation.
webster's
new
international
dictionary,
second
edition
unabridged
says,
“status,
a
condition
of
a
person
by
which
the
nature
of
his
legal
personality
and
his
legal
capacities
are
determined.
and
therefore,
the
nature
of
the
legal
relations
to
the
state
or
to
other
persons
into
which
he
may
enter
including
as
commonly
used,
a
persons
condition
arising
out
of
age
such
as
infancy
or
wardship,
sex
such
as
marriage,
mental
capacity,
crime,
alienates,
or
public
petition.”
we
start
the
interpretation
of
the
long
--
the
catalanotte
case
with
a
formal
finding
by
the
highest
administrative
tribunal
with
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
that
before
the
effective
date
of
the
1952
act,
catalanotte
had
the
status
or
condition
or
liability
of
being
nondeportable.
at
page
16
of
the
record,
you'll
find
the
respondent
actually
did
not
become
deportable
because
of
the
1952
conviction
until
the
effective
date
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
december
24,
1952.
this
finding
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
was
quoted
by
the
court
below
in
accepting
a
finding
of
status
and
said
that
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
was
justified
on
this
record
in
finding
that
that
was
his
status.
the
question
whether
respondent
is
deportable
now
depends
solely
on
a
charge,
which
was
lodged
at
the
reopen
hearing
on
july
19,
1954.
this
charge
is
based
on
respondent's
conviction
in
1925
for
a
violation
of
sections
1
and
8
of
the
act
of
december
14th,
1914
as
amended,
at
which
time,
he
was
sentenced
to
imprisonment
for
60
days
and
was
fined
$1000.
that
is
also
a
statement
of
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
that
appears
in
the
record.
the
respondent's
position
was
that
this
finding
was
sufficient
on
which
to
base
his
claim
that
405
applies.
leading
up
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
decision,
the
respondent
had
presented
to
the
board
and
later
to
the
district
court,
the
showing
that
the
1931
act
relating
to
the
deportation
of
persons
convicted
of
narcotic
violation
was
expressly
prospective.
let
me
refer
to
the
record
to
your
honors
to
show
that
the
issue
in
the
district
court
on
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
was
that
the
order
of
deportation
was
invalid
for
the
reason
that
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
had
made
a
misapplication
of
the
law
in
the
proceedings
up
to
that
time.
it
was
admitted
in
the
answer
to
the
petition.
it's
always
in
the
petition
that
this
petitioner's
--
petitioner
there
and
respondent
here
was
a
lawful
resident
of
the
united
states
since
he
was
admitted
for
permanent
residence
on
september
11th,
1920.
that
appears
on
page
4
as
well
as
elsewhere
in
the
record.
the
united
states
attorney
admitted
that.
now,
the
general
allegation
was
the
misapplication
of
the
law
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
and
the
finding
of
the
district
court
was
in
these
words
that
we
had
no
protection
by
section
405
as
we
had
claimed
throughout.
and
this
was
what
the
court's
order
said,
“in
appearing
from
the
study
of
all
the
proceedings
that
the
petitioner
is
not
protected
by
any
immunity
on
his
1925
conviction
and
that
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
is
within
its
proper
jurisdiction
to
order
his
deportation
of
this
alien
under
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.”
in
other
words,
they
had
made
no
misapplication
of
the
law
and
catalanotte
had
no
protection
from
oral
fine.
now,
upon
--
we
appeal
that
and
i
might
say
the
chief
judge
(inaudible)
had
considerable
difficulty
in
arriving
at
his
decision
as
it
will
be
apparent
from
the
record
where
it
shows
hearings,
rehearings
and
considerable
time
during
which
the
court
was
wrestling
with
the
apparent
contradictory
considerations
before
it.
but
when
we
got
to
the
court
to
of
appeals
in
contrast
to
the
difficulty,
which
the
district
court
had,
the
court
of
appeals
was
unanimous
in
saying
that
there
was
no
dilemma
where
the
district
court
had
seen
it
for
the
reason
that
the
plain
language
of
405
removed
the
other
horn
of
the
apparent
dilemma.
you
have
a
saving
of
the
rights
which
catalanotte
had
in
which
he
was
claiming.
mr.
louis
m.
hopping
in
--
in
the
carson
case,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
louis
m.
hopping
well,
if
the
court
please,
i'm
thinking
only
of
catalanotte
and
his
situation.
mr.
louis
m.
hopping
yes,
but
regard
to
catalanotte,
i
think
it
cannot
be
otherwise
and
that
would
be
true
of
many
--
mr.
louis
m.
hopping
well,
i
would
say
of
many
other
features
of
it.
i
don
t
know
--
mr.
louis
m.
hopping
well,
i
think
that
the
congress
might
have
carved
out
a
new
ground
of
deportation,
which
would
be
a
test
of
present
undesirability
depending
on
a
whole
course
of
past
action,
not
simply
on
a
conviction
of
an
old
offense.
i
--
i
think
the
argument
as
i
said
in
the
beginning,
that
the
solicitor
general
makes
about
the
selective
training
and
service
act
is
an
argument
on
my
side
as
i
see
it
for
this
reason.
we
had
said
all
along
that
if
it's
purely
adding
the
penalty
of
deportation
to
a
conviction
for
which
the
man
is
already
been
sentenced
and
punished,
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
say
that
congress
had
the
power
to
do
it.
but
whether
they
say
that
would
reference
to
the
selective
training
and
service
act,
they
coupled
it
with
language
which
means
they
have
to
find
that
he
is
then
presently
undesirable.
so
that
it
would
be
the
conviction
of
that
act
for
something
else,
but
may
i
at
the
same
time
leave
with
that
the
--
the
considerations
which
mr.
justice
douglas
pointed
out
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
marcello
where
he
says,
“solely
for
conviction
of
a
narcotic
offense
seems
to
be
adding
a
penalty
now
for
something
that
was
completed
long
ago,”
and
the
only
basis
for
deportation
is
that.
mr.
louis
m.
hopping
no,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
m.
hopping
may
i
--
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
--
mr.
louis
m.
hopping
do
you
mean,
during
the
history
of
the
act?
mr.
louis
m.
hopping
as
i
understand
the
history
of
the
act
and
i
may
say
i
thank
the
court
for
allowing
me
to
take
advantage
of
the
arguments
of
my
brother
counsel,
predicament
to
mr.
carliner.
i
understand
the
history
of
the
act
as
such
that
there
was
period
when
--
mr.
louis
m.
hopping
if
you
could
say
that
241
was
effective
and
405
was
not,
he
would
have
been
--
mr.
louis
m.
hopping
yes.
mr.
louis
m.
hopping
in
that
situation
--
mr.
louis
m.
hopping
if
you
could
say
that
241
apply
and
405
did
not,
he
would
be
deportable,
yes
your
honor.
