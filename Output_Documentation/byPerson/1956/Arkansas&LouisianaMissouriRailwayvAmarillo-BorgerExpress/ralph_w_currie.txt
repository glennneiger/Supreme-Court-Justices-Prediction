mr.
ralph
w.
currie
mr.
chief
justice
and
--
may
it
please
the
court.
within
the
time
which
is
allotted
to
me,
i
want
to
discuss
the
several
legal
questions
that
are
presented
by
this
appeal,
including
the
question
of
mootness,
and
thereafter,
assuming
that
a
justiciable
controversy
exist
my
reasons
for
arguing
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
should
be
affirmed.
but
before
i
begin
the
legal
argument,
i
think
it's
appropriate
and
i
believe
i
can
be
of
the
greatest
assistance
to
the
court
if
i
recite
what
the
facts
are,
because
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
explain
my
reasons
for
a
legal
conclusion
without
associating
it
with
the
facts
upon
which
these
conclusions
are
based.
now,
the
commodity
that
we're
dealing
with
here
is
a
commodity
known
as
carbon
black.
carbon
black
is
a
product
of
natural
gas
and
oil.
it
is
produced
primarily
in
the
state
of
texas
and
--
in
the
southwest.
and
the
panhandle
area
of
texas
is
the
largest
producer
of
carbon
black.
the
principal
users
of
carbon
black
are
the
rubber
manufacturers
or
the
tire
manufacturers.
the
--
there's
a
statement
in
the
record
to
the
effect
that
approximately
95%
of
all
carbon
black
is
used
in
the
manufacture
of
rubber
to
its
entirety.
the
interstate
commerce
commission
found
in
this
particular
proceeding
and
--
and
the
proceedings
reported
in
298
i.c.c.
at
721.
and
on
page
723
of
that
decision,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
this
case
pointed
out
that
between
40%
and
60%
of
all
of
the
carbon
black
that
was
used
in
rubber
was
consumed
around
the
akron,
ohio
area.
so
that
for
all
practical
purposes
what
we
have
here
was
a
movement,
a
tremendous
movement
of
carbon
black
from
the
panhandle
area
of
texas
into
akron,
ohio.
the
commission's
proceeding
also
discussed
the
fact
that
during
the
years
1954
and
1955,
there
seemed
to
be
about
700,000
tons
of
this
commodity
that
moved.
it's
quite
a
substantial
movement.
and
the
figures
revealed
to
the
commission
and
recited
by
it
in
that
decision.
it
showed
that
66
and
ninth-tenth
percent
of
it
was
moved
by
rail
during
those
years
and
28
--
eighth
--
and
eight-tenth
percent
by
motor
carrier
with
four
and
three-tenths
percent
by
seatrain.
a
seatrain
is
a
water
carrier
that
holds
loaded
railroad
cars.
there
was
no
movement
by
barge
and
by
way
of
momentary
digression,
it
is
hard
for
me
to
restrain
a
chuckle
when
i
hear
counsel
say
as
he
did
yesterday
that
the
purpose
in
reducing
these
rate
was
to
forestall
barge
competition
because
there
immediately
appears
before
my
mind
the
picture
of
a
barge
moving
from
the
area
panhandle
of
texas
across
the
plains
there
to
akron,
ohio
which
is
also
a
place
not
on
water.
the
truth
is
that
this
movement
of
carbon
black,
it
moved
entirely
by
rail
or
by
motor
carrier.
those
were
the
two
competing
forms
of
transportation
that
moved
it.
now,
prior
to
1954,
and
i
will
let
you
say
this.
it
constituted
for
the
appellees
and
motor
carriers
whom
i
represent
here
a
very
important
piece
of
business.
it
was
important
out
of
proportion
to
the
revenue
we
received
for
it
because
it
supplied
us
with
a
return
haul.
you
see,
under
our
certificates
which
the
commission
issued
to
us,
we
are
not
allowed
to
handle
products
in
bulk.
we
are
not
allowed
to
handle
livestock.
now,
in
the
panhandle
area
of
texas,
the
things
that
are
produced
are
grain,
which
moves
in
bulk
and
oil
which
moves
in
bulk
or
by
pipeline
and
carriers.
consequently,
when
we
carry
products
of
general
merchandise
into
the
west
texas
panhandle
area,
there
is
little
that
we
are
authorized
to
move
back.
and
carbon
black
which
moves
in
sacks
is
a
commodity
which
offered
us
a
return
haul
into
the
akron,
ohio
area.
so,
it
was
of
a
--
a
great
deal
of
importance
and
at
the
time
this
controversy
arose.
we
were
--
excuse
me.
we
were
getting
revenues
in
excess
of
a
$1000
a
day
out
of
this
transportation
of
the
small
percentage
of
the
carbon
black
that
we
were
being
privileged
to
handle.
prior
to
1954,
the
rail
rates
and
the
motor
carrier
rates
were
on
the
same
level
or
substantially
the
same
level.
it
had
been
that
way
for
some
time.
now,
during
the
period
following
world
war
ii,
there
had
been
blanket
general
increases
granted
to
the
railroads
and
taken
by
the
motor
carriers.
and
as
a
result
of
this
--
of
the
application
of
these
blanket
general
increases,
the
rates
got
slightly
out
of
adjustment.
the
typical
illustration
which
everybody
agrees
was
typical,
was
the
rate
from
the
panhandle
points
of
texas
such
as
borger
and
amarillo
into
akron,
ohio.
there,
the
--
the
rate
when
you
add
it
on
the
various
increases
and
calculated
them
according
to
the
different
formulas,
the
rails
had
a
rate
of
$1.56
a
hundred
and
the
motor
carriers
a
rate
of
$1.53
a
hundred.
the
railroads
in
--
early
in
1954
filed
a
new
schedule
and
reduced
their
rate
not
to
meet
the
motor
carrier
rate
but
down
to
$1.4785,
one
hundredths
cents
per
hundred,
which
put
them
five
and
fifteen
one
hundred
cents
per
hundred
pounds
below
the
then
prevailing
motor
carrier
rate.
the
motor
carriers
then
filed
with
the
commission
a
new
tariff
seeking
to
establish
the
same
$1.4785
per
hundred
pounds.
the
rails
protested
that
and
the
commission
suspended
the
rates
of
the
motor
carrier.
that
was
in
1954.
hearing
was
had
on
the
suspension.
they
entered
onto
an
investigation
and
the
hearing
was
had
in
july
1954.
the
seven
months
period
expired
with
no
action
on
the
part
of
the
commission
and
the
motor
carriers
voluntarily
extended
the
period
of
suspension
and
this
was
the
customary
practice
we
are
told
until
the
commission
could
complete
its
investigation.
at
the
time
of
the
controversy
which
had
its
inception
in
september
1925
--
of
1955,
the
commission
had
not
yet
completed
its
investigation
and
had
not
handed
down
its
decision.
neither
had
it
done
so
at
the
time
of
the
trial
in
the
court
below.
so
that
the
practical
effect
of
that
situation
was
that
the
railroads
were
enjoying
a
differential
of
five
and
fifteen-one
hundred
cents
below
our
rate,
notwithstanding
that
differential
in
their
favor.
they
proceeded
by
carriers
which
were
scheduled
to
become
effective
on
september
the
24th,
1955.
rates
which
cut
the
particular
rate
down
from
a
dollar
forty-seven
eighty-five
down
to
a
dollar
thirty-three,
precisely
twenty
cents,
a
hundred
pounds
under
our
rate.
we
knew
then
that
we
could
not
exist
with
a
twenty-cent
differential
against
this.even
the
28%
of
the
traffic
we
were
getting
would
be
gone
with
700,000
tons
moving
that.
20
cents
a
hundred
is
--
is
quite
a
difference.
so,
we
petitioned
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
suspend
those
rates
on
the
ground
as
we
thought
that
they
were
--
the
rail
carriers
were
embarking
upon
a
course
of
a
destructive
competitive
practice
that
was
in
contravention
on
the
national
transportation
policy.
the
--
the
commission
suspended
our
rates,
i
mean
the
rail
rates.
our
petition
was
granted.
by
its
order
of
september
the
23rd,
1955
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
not
the
board
of
suspension,
but
the
commission,
the
division
2
itself,
acting
as
an
appellate
division
entered
this
order
which
was
admitted
by
everybody
to
be
a
valid
order
and
well
within
the
powers
of
the
commission.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
it
did,
sir,
yes.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
no,
sir.
they
--
well,
we
had
a
conference
and
the
record
reveals
this
sentence.
we
had
a
conference
and
the
board
of
suspension
which
is
the
--
the
employees
of
the
commission
declined
to
suspend.
and
immediately,
we
asked
the
--
the
division
itself
to
look
into
the
matter
and
on
the
same
day,
the
commission
did
look
into
it
and
decided
the
board
was
wrong
and
issued
this
order
suspending
the
rates.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
yes,
sir.
i
--
i
don't
know
what
they
would
have
had
to
say.
probably,
they
would
have
had
to
say
nothing.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
if
they
didn't
want
to
reverse
the
board
of
suspension,
they
wouldn't
have
to
say
anything.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
no,
sir,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
this,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
and
i'll
digress
from
the
statement
of
facts
for
the
moment
to
say
this.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
but
i
would
like
to
answer
your
question,
sir.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
well,
it
--
it's
relevant.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
certainly.
you
see,
the
carrier
under
the
statute
--
under
section
15
subsection
7
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
the
carrier
has
the
right
to
initiate
its
own
rates,
simply
by
publishing
them
with
the
commission
and
as
--
given
30
days
notice.
at
the
exploration
of
the
30-day
period,
the
rates
go
into
effect
unless
the
commission
by
affirmative
action
has
stopped
them
from
going
into
effect.
so
that
if
the
commission
decides
that
it
is
not
going
to
suspend,
all
it
needs
do
is
nothing
and
the
rates
go
into
effect.
it
requires
affirmative
action
on
the
part
of
the
commission
to
make
a
--
a
rate
that
the
carrier
has
a
right
to
initiate
--
suspend
it
and
you
operate
it.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
except
for
the
action
of
the
commission,
except
for
the
action
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
which
on
the
--
on
september
the
23rd,
1955
issued
its
order
finding
this
probable
unlawfulness
and
suspending
the
record.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
had
the
commission
done
nothing
about
it?
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
that
would
have
been
--
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
yes,
sir.
then,
the
--
i
think
the
--
in
--
i
believe,
your
honor,
has
it
correct
that
if
--
if
the
board
of
suspension
had
decided
to
do
nothing,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
itself
on
our
appeal
to
--
to
it
to
examine
the
action
of
its
employees
had
resulted
in
no
action,
then
these
rates
would
have
automatically
gone
into
effect
on
september
the
24th
as
scheduled.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
now
--
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
i'd
like
to
get
to
that
a
little
later.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
yes,
sir.
and
i
think,
usually,
when
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
or
any
other
court,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
changes
its
mind,
it
says,
“why
it
did.”
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
and
we
have
the
situation
here,
which
i
would
like
to
outline
further
in
the
facts
where
the
vice
in
the
commission
order
here
was
that
they
didn't
say
they
were
wrong.
the
effect
of
their
finding
was
and
the
effect
of
what
they
did
subsequently
was
to
reaffirm
that
they
were
right
in
the
first
place
in
their
finding
of
probable
unlawfulness,
but
persisted
in
doing
--
in
taking
away
the
protection
of
the
order
which
they
had
already
said
and
reiterated,
we
were
entitled
to
receive.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
they
do
not
say
that
in
so
many
words.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
if
we
examine
page
7,
we
find
the
order
which
i
am
challenging
in
which
it
says
that
by
an
order
on
page
7
of
the
record
--
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
page
7
of
the
record,
the
commission
refers
to
the
order
of
september
the
23rd
and
says
that
it
entered
upon
an
investigation
concerning
unlawfulness
of
the
rates
and
charges.
that
consideration
has
been
given
to
petitions
of
the
respondents
requesting
vacation
and
to
reply
as
thereto
in
good
cause
appearing.
it
is
ordered
that
the
order
be
set
aside
insofar
as
it
suspended
the
operations,
but
the
proceeding
of
investigation
of
said
schedule
shall
continue
in
full
force
in
effect.
i
say
that
the
necessary
effect
of
that
order,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
is
that
they
reaffirmed
the
findings
of
probable
unlawfulness
because,
otherwise,
they
would
not
have
continued
to
investigate
schedules.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
no,
sir.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
but
a
request
for
a
suspension,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
is
not
a
formal
complaint.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
that's
correct,
and
if
they
do,
sir,
they
are
by
that
very
act
saying
in
effect
that
there
is
something
probably
unlawful
with
these
rates
and
we're
going
to
look
into
the
matter.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
no,
sir.
i
do
not
say.
i
say
that
--
that
probable
cause
exists
and
probable
cause
did
exist,
i
think
or
they
would
not
have
undertaken
the
investigation.
the
court
below
in
its
opinion
--
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
yes.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
all
right.
the
--
the
commission
there,
as
i
say,
entered
this
order
of
suspension
in
which
it
found.
it
stated
reasons
as
required
under
section
15(7)
that
these
rates
would
--
it
is
--
there
is
reason
to
believe
said
the
commission
that
these
rates
would,
if
permitted
to
become
effective,
result
in
rates
and
charges
on
rules
and
regulations
and
practices
that
would
be
unlawful
and
would
violate
the
national
transportation
policy.
the
order
then
went
on
to
suspend
the
schedules
and
to
tell
the
railroads
that
neither
these
schedules
suspended
nor
those
sought
to
be
ordered
by
the
new
schedules
should
be
changed
until
the
proceeding
has
been
disposed
off
or
until
the
period
of
suspension
had
expired
or
until
otherwise
ordered
by
the
commission.
now,
there
is
where
the
man
arrested
until
on
november
the
14th,
1955.
the
commission
entered
the
order
which
we
challenge
in
the
court
below.
that
is
the
order
to
which
--
which
appears
on
page
7
of
the
record
and
to
which
i
have
just
made
reference.
we
didn't
get
notice
of
it.
of
course,
the
instant
date
was
filed
but
as
soon
as
we
did,
we
went
to
the
district
court.
in
the
meantime,
we
asked
the
commission
to
weigh
the
rule
and
modify
the
rule
and
reconsider
the
action
of
division
2
by
the
entire
commission.
the
--
the
commission
declined
to
do
that
on
november
the
23rd.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
it
had
then
advanced,
sir,
and
the
record
does
not
show
it.
i
do
not
have
them.
i
never
did
see
the
petitions
for
--
for
the
petitions
requesting
vacation
nor
--
and
--
nor
the
reply.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
i
take
it
so,
sir,
but
i
did
not
found
one
and
i
did
not
see
the
others.
i'm
sorry,
and
it
was
never
--
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
sir?
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
mr.
justice
brennan's
question,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
was
what
was
the
substance
of
those
petitions?
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
i'm
sure
there
was.
they
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
i'm
sure
so.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
the
present
respondents
would
not
--
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
oh
the
first
respondents,
yes.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
the
appellees.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
so
far
as
i
know,
my
--
these
present
appellees
did
not
file
a
reply
except
in
connection
with
or
they
were
represented
by
their
--
by
their
several
freight
bureaus.
i
didn't
see
them.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
then
well,
let's
--
let
us
concede
that
they
did,
sir,
because
i'm
sure
that
the
question
--
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
--
that
would
be
--
that
would
be
near
--
most
against
me
and
i'm
willing
to
concede
that
they
did
file
replies,
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
now,
the
replies
were
filed,
we
would
say
and
--
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
the
--
what
i
meant
was
we
didn't
get
it
immediately.
in
other
words,
it
wasn't
--
we
didn't
get
it
on
november
the
14th.
asdministrative
processes
being
what
they
are,
it
took
the
commission
a
few
days
before
it
was
able
to
get
to
my
clients.
this
order,
i
think,
is
about
a
week
it
took
them
before
the
--
and
now,
we
made
no
complaint
about
it.
it
just
took
about
a
week
to
get
the
order
mimeographed
and
distribute
it
to
everybody.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
well,
the
order
was
november
14th,
effective
november
24th,
two
months
to
be
precise.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
the
only
thing
that
took
--
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
i
do
not
challenge
the
fact
that
petitions
were
filed
and
replies
were
made.
i
say
they
were
to
the
--
my
--
my
only
ignorance,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
was
that
i
do
not
know
what
they
said
and
which
was
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
what
was
the
substance
of
them
and
i
didn't
know.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
i
think
that
the
court
might
--
if
--
if
the
court
is
privileged
to
be
indulged
in
the
presumption
i
think
that
this
would
be
the
--
the
presumption.
that
if
there
had
been,
sir,
questions
in
that
order
or
in
the
petitions
which
caused
the
commission
to
change
its
mind
and
to
decide
that
the
facts
which
it
thought
existed
on
september
the
23rd
did
not,
in
truth,
exist.
the
commission
could
have
said
so
and
should
have
said
so
in
its
order
of
vacation.
so
that
i
think
the
fair
inference
to
be
drawn
is
that
there
was
noting
in
those
petitions
or
nor
in
the
replies
which
would
have
caused
the
commission
to
change
its
mind
about
the
reasons
why
these
rates
might
have
been
probably
involved.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
i
doubt
that,
sir.
i
think
they
would
have
had
to
gone
farther
and
said,
“we
were
in
error
in
finding
that
these
rates
were
probably
unlawful.”
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
can
only
say,
sir,
that
if
that
had
been
the
language,
i
would
have
hesitated
a
long
time
before
i
had
gone
to
court.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
i
would
be
inclined
to
think
that
i
--
i
would
not
be
on
various
sound
right
now.
however,
i
did
not
reach
that
point
and
because
that
wasn't
what
occurred.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
and
--
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
if
that
had
been
the
--
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
i'm
rather
inclined
to
think,
sir,
in
all
candor
that
i
would
not
have
gone
to
court
under
those
circumstances.
i
think
i
would
have
just
decided
that
that
was
within
the
discretion
of
the
commission
and
i
have
a
very
clear
opinion
in
my
own
mind
that
the
lower
--
that
the
court
below
would
not
have
sustained
this.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
no,
there
were
replies,
sir.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
yes.
there
were
replies
in
the
conference.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
no,
sir,
no,
sir.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
none
that
i
know
of,
mr.
justice
harlan,
other
than
--
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
sir?
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
simply
because
we
took
the
position
and
i
still
take
it,
sir,
that
this
court
on
--
nor
the
lower
court
would
not
be
required
to
search
the
record
to
find
a
basis
upon
which
the
commission
might
have
acted
when
it
didn't
say
it
acted
on
any
basis
and
that
the
validity
of
the
order,
of
any
reviewable
order
must
be
tested
by
the
recitals
in
the
order.
and
only
if
you
challenge
these
bases
for
the
recitals
and
say
that
there
is
no
facts
upon
which
that
order
can
be
based.
is
it
necessary
or
even
appropriate
that
one
bring
up
the
record
upon
which
the
commission
says
it
acted
thus
thereby
showing
that
there
was
no
factual
basis
for
the
recital.
but
whereas
here,
there
was
no
recital
of
any
fact
or
what
is
more
properly
stated
where
they
were
reiterated
or
in
effect
reaffirmed
findings
which
entitled
as
to
certain
protection
and
no
basis
for
any
contrary
action,
then
the
action
itself
is
subject
to
attack
the
cause.
it
does
not
disclose
the
basis
on
which
the
action
was
taken.
we
went
to
--
to
continue
with
the
recital
of
the
facts.
we
went
then
to
the
district
court,
the
judge
atwell,
the
district
judge
before
whom
the
case
was
filed
and
to
whom
the
petition
for
temporary
restraining
order
was
presented,
declined
to
issue
it
on
the
ground
that
he
didn't
feel
that
there
would
be
any
damage
done
to
the
complainants
until
such
time
as
the
application
for
temporary
injunction
could
be
heard.
although
the
record
doesn't
show
that
the
railroads
were
present,
it
does
show
that,
on
page
12,
that
the
government
was
present.
the
railroads
were
actually
present.
i
invited
them.
they
didn't
show
here
because
at
that
time,
they
had
not
formally
intervened.
now,
the
proceeding
went
on.
the
dealing
with
the
subsequent
proceedings
before
the
commission
or
after
the
--
the
court
had
heard
the
case
on
december
the
12th,
on
january
the
23rd
it
entered
its
order
finding
that
the
order
under
attack
was
invalid.
thereafter,
and
by
the
way,
the
court
was
pretty
careful
to
say
that
they
were
simply
--
it
is
simply
saying
that
the
order
of
september
23
could
be
modified.
they
weren't
going
to
say
that
the
commission
could
not
have
changed
its
mind.
but
if
they
do
change
their
mind
or
if
it
did
change
its
mind,
it
had
to
do
so
under
lawful
means
and
set
the
matter
back
to
the
commission
with
the
open
invitation
on
page
59
of
the
record
that
the
commission
should
--
if
it
wanted
to
set
aside
the
order
of
september
23rd,
do
so
lawfully.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
or
january
the
23rd.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
i
do
not
think
they
would
have
done
that.
i
think
that
you
would
have
to
treat
it
as
though
the
commission
still
had
the
petitions
for
reconsideration
under
advisement
and
it
could
have
on
january
the
23rd,
then
simply
entered
an
order
granting
the
petitions
for
reconsideration
asserting
the
factual
basis
upon
which
it
acted.
we
don't
give
--
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
as
i
say,
sir,
if
they
--
commission
has
--
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
sir?
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
no,
sir.
of
course
they
didn't.
they
did
not
say
that.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
they
did
not
say
--
they
did
not
say
anything
to
indicate
the
slightest
that
they
were
dissatisfied
with
the
order
of
september
23,
1955.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
let
me
put
it
this
way,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
you
may
be
able
to
change
your
opinion,
but
here
in
this
case,
the
commission
was
under
a
statutory
duty
and
under
section
15,
subsection
7
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
to
state
reasons
why
it
would
interfere
with
the
--
with
the,
otherwise,
invaluable
right
of
the
carrier
to
initiate
its
own
rates.
it
made
this
statement.
it
--
it
stated
those
reasons
and
those
reasons
were
in
substance
that
other
people
were
going
to
be
hurt
by
this
publication
or
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there
would
be.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
we
can
agree
that
the
only
time
the
commission
in
the
exercise
of
sound
discretion
can
interfere
with
the
carrier's
right
to
publish
its
own
rates
is
because
it
has
determined
that
somebody
is
going
to
get
hurt.
otherwise,
there's
no
reason
to
interfere
with
what
the
carrier
may
do.
and
once
the
commission
has
found
that
there
exist
a
situation,
which
causes
--
which
may
injure
someone
and
has
decided
to
take
action
to
protect
that
someone.
then,
if
the
commission
decides
that
it
is
wrong
about
that
that
those
facts
do
not
exist.
i
think
it
owes
to
that
person
the
same
duty.
having
once
found
that
those
rights
are
to
be
protected,
the
commission
is
under
a
mandatory
duty
to
protect
them
and
if
it
finds
it's
in
error
about
that,
it
owes
to
the
--
to
the
person
whose
rights
are
thus
being
not
longer
protected,
the
duty
to
say
--
to
give
the
reasons
for
it
just
as
though
to
the
same
standards
it
had
to
tell
the
carrier
in
the
first
place.
i
think
that's
just
with
simple
fairness
and
a
necessary
corollary
to
the
suspension
power.
those
things,
the
commission
did
not
do.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
seemed
to
have
regarded
it,
just
as
though
--
just
as
the
district
court
did
in
the
western
supply,
the
western
electric
company
against
cinema
supplies
company,
a
case
by
the
sixth
circuit,
in
which
the
court
seemed
to
have
found
on
a
temporary
injunction,
mind
you.
it
found
all
of
the
facts
in
favor
of
the
plaintiffs
that
would
entitle
the
plaintiffs
to
the
injunctive
relief
sought.
and
then
said
that
we
have
balanced
the
equities
and
they
decided
that
we
will
not
issue
the
injunction
because
under
the
--
all
of
the
balancing
of
equities,
it
would
not
be
right
to
do
it.
and
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
--
for
the
sixth
circuit
reversed
and
said
that
when
a
court
has
made
--
when
a
case
for
temporary
injunction
is
clearly
made
out.
it
does
not
lie
within
the
power
of
a
court,
though
it'd
be
discretionary
to
deny
the
remedy.
and
certainly
whereas
here,
the
facts
which
the
commission
found
to
exist
and
which
it
did
not
take
away
in
its
subsequent
order
as
it
left
those
facts
still
enforced
by
its
subsequent
order
--
by
the
very
nature
of
the
order.
it's
simply
saying
that
were
just
not
going
to
grant
the
remedy
any
longer.
that
was
our
complaint
and
that
was
the
real
vice
in
the
argument,
in
the
order
of
the
commission.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
i
think
that
--
that
would
have
been
much
stronger.
now,
mind
you
--
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
so
far
as
i
can
now
determine,
sir,
that
would
have
been
enough.
i
--
i
say
that
simply
because
i
have
done
--
i
have
briefed
this
case
and
have
--
have
satisfied
myself
about
the
applicable
principles
of
the
law,
relating
them
only,
sir,
to
the
facts
that
are
here
present.
i
would
not
want
to
hazard
a
--
an
opinion
as
to
what
the
law
might
be
where
the
facts
differ.
although,
i
can
appreciate
that
your
honors
must
take
those
things
into
account.
i
would
not
want
to
be
unhelpful
by
making
a
wrong
guess.
and
i
would
say
that
based
on
what
i
now
know,
i
would
say
that
would
have
been
enough
having
that
been
the
situation.
certainly,
it's
the
point
--
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
no.
then
--
then
we
might
have
had
--
we
might
have
been
back
in
the
courthouse.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
remember
telling
judge
brown
who
asked
the
question
about,
suppose
that
--
suppose
we
send
this
back
to
the
commission
and
the
commission
makes
findings,
what
are
you
going
to
do
then?
and
i
had
said
to
him
that
so
far
as
i
am
presently
informed,
there's
nothing
in
those
petitions
that
would
change
the
--
that
would
change
the
--
that
should
have
changed
the
commission's
mind
and
we
might
well
be
back
to
challenge
the
action
of
the
commission
on
the
ground
that
the
action
had
no
factual
basis
even
though
the
facts
were
recited.
and
we
could
have
--
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
no,
sir,
no,
sir.
as
i
said,
i
did
not
consider
it
necessary
to
bring
them
up
in
the
court
below.
the
--
the
absence
of
them
was
not
challenged
in
the
court
below.
the
commission
made
no
effort
to
--
to
justify
its
action
either
in
the
court
below
and
here,
i
mean
as
a
de
facto
matter.
the
--
the
whole
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
commission
was,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
and
truth
justified
based
on
the
petitions
has
never
been
presented.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
on
the
authority
of
--
of
other
decisions,
yes
sir,
by
this
court
because
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
that
an
order
of
an
administrative
agency
must
--
the
order
itself
must
disclose
the
basis
upon
which
the
action
was
taken.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
what
i
am
trying
to
impart
to
the
court,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
was
simply
that
it
seems
to
be
the
rules
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
determine
that
when
--
when
an
administrative
order
is
challenged,
the
basis
upon
which
the
order
was
made
must
appear
on
the
face
of
the
record.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
now,
to
deal
with
the
factual
situation
again,
the
--
the
proceeding
continued
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
resulting
on
june
the
25th,
1956
in
an
order
terminating
the
proceedings
and
finding
the
rates
to
be
lawful
or
reasonably
compensatory
to
the
carriers
and
that
in
--
incidentally,
i
should
add
this
that
on
april
the
23rd,
the
--
the
suspension
order
of
september
23
which
had
been
revived
by
the
order
of
the
district
court
expired
by
reason
of
its
own
terms.
on
april
the
24th,
the
railroads
republished
the
tariffs
and
the
rates
that
were
under
suspension
theretofore,
the
rates
that
should
--
that
were
originally
scheduled
to
go
into
effect
on
september
the
24th.
these
reduced
rates
became
effective
on
april
the
24th,
1956.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
no,
sir.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
yes,
sir.
when
the
commission
finally
finished
its
investigation
on
june
the
25th,
1956,
and
that
proceeding
is
reported
in
298
i.c.c.
721.
that
happened
after
the
case
was
heard
--
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
that
leaves
them
presently,
sir.
that
leaves
presently,
sir.
by
the
way,
i
should
add
as
a
matter
of
--
of
information
that
ultimately,
the
commission
found
that
our
rates
were
all
right
too.
and
so
that
presently,
the
--
the
relationship
between
the
motor
carriers
and
the
rail
carriers
is
that
the
rate
from
the
panhandle
to
--
to
akron
by
rail
is
$1.33
per
hundred
and
the
rate
from
--
by
motor
carrier
from
the
same
points
--
between
the
same
point
is
$1.4785.
we
have
been
permitted
to
meet
the
older
rail
rate,
but
we
have
not
tried
to
meet
the
new
rail
rate.
we
can't
because
we
just
can't
justify
it.
we
know
the
commission
would
--
would
--
our
over
the
road
cost
of
operation
just
wouldn't
meet
and
we
just
can't
do
it.
so,
we
have
not
tried
to
meet
that
rate.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
i
assume
so,
sir.
at
least
they
found
that
--
that
the
rails
--
it
was
compensatory
for
the
rails
and
we
have
decided
in
our
managerial
discretion
that
it's
not
compensatory
for
us.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
oh,
no
sir.
not
now.
it
is
--
it
is
finished.
that
is
why,
mr.
justice
black,
that
this
case
is
moot.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
five
and
fifteen
one
hundred
cents,
sir.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
fourteen
and
eighty-five
one
hundred
cents,
sir.
that's
still
the
differential
over
--
under
up.
we
do
not
have
the
advantage
of
this
traffic
any
longer,
sir,
no
matter
what
this
court
may
do
with
this
proceeding.
this
appellee,
motor
carriers
have
nothing
to
gain
nor
to
lose.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
well,
sir
--
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
it
made
this
difference.
i
--
i
just
didn't
feel,
sir,
that
as
an
officer
of
this
court
and
been
having
--
been
successful
in
the
court
below
that
it
would
--
it
was
quite
the
discharge
in
my
duty
as
counsel
nor
my
client
to
make
no
effort
to
defend
a
--
a
situation
which
we
regarded
as
correct
at
the
time.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
that's
correct,
sir.
we
have
already
lost
--
what
we
lose
otherwise.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
that's
correct
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
would
not
lose
anymore
than
we've
already
lost.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
sir?
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
i
did
not,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
bring
it
here.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
i
did
not
bring
it
here.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
now,
i
concede
that
my
duty
as
counsel,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
to
tell
the
court
that
i
consider
it
moot.
i
--
i
would
like
to
say
that
it's
not
moot
and
i
would
like
to
say
that
it
ought
to
be
affirmed
on
its
merits,
but
i
do
not
really,
sir,
as
a
lawyer
that
i
can
truthfully
say
that
i
think
that
it
is
not
moot.
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
if
counsel
is
to
discharge
his
full
duties
to
the
court,
it
ought
to
disclose
to
the
court
any
facts
and
circumstances
which
might
render
the
case
moot
because
the
court
certainly
does
not
want
to
spend
its
time
and
efforts
and
energies
in
deciding
controversies.
the
--
where
the
logic
of
events
has
turned
the
investigation
into
an
autopsy,
instead
of
a
determination
of
litigations.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
i
can
answer
that
question
only
this
way,
sir,
because
i'm
not
sure
that
i
have
quite
followed,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
sir,
the
--
now,
my
client
and
by
the
way,
only
one
of
these
seven
felt
that
he
wanted
to
spend
the
time
and
money
to
get
in
and
justify
the
action
of
the
court
below,
that's
why
i'm
here.
we
have
this
feeling
about
it,
sir,
that
if
it's
not
moot
and
the
other
side
of
the
case,
it
isn't
moot.
and
we
do
not
want
to
see
the
case
reversed
for
--
just
by
a
--
as
a
result
of
a
default.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
it
certainly
was
a
very
live
one
when
we
filed
the
suit.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
it
become
moot
--
it
became
moot
--
i'm
sorry.
it
became
moot
on
april
the
23rd
when
the
suspension
order
which
we
asked
which
was
entered
for
our
protection
expired
by
reason
of
the
seven-month
statutory
period.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
that's
--
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
that's
correct
and
there's
no
--
and
there's
no
live
controversy
so
far
as
the
railroads
are
concerned,
either,
sir,
in
my
opinion.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
no,
sir.
the
lower
rate
is
now
the
legal
rate,
sir.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
wonder
if
there
is
any
liability
on
the
--
to
me,
it
seems
this,
that
to
say
that
the
railroad
is
liable
to
collect
the
undercharge,
it's
just
a
--
a
use
of
word.
actually,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
--
if
that
--
what
the
railroads
are
in
effect
saying
is
that
if
this
--
if
the
action
of
the
court
is
upheld,
we're
entitled
to
more
money,
which
i
do
not
perceive
to
be
a
--
a
detriment.
they're
entitled
to
more
money.
it
isn't
--
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
i
--
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
yes.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
i'd
be
--
i'd
be
glad
to,
sir.
i'll
try
to
answer
the
questions
and
that
may
have
been
why.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
well,
my
brief
--
let
me
say
it
this
way,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
proceeding
involves
only
one
question.
here,
the
commission
issued
and
admitted
a
valid
suspension
order.
it
suspended
certain
rate
schedules.
thereafter,
it
attempted
to
set
aside
that
suspension
order.
the
order
--
the
--
the
district
court
said
that
that
attempt
was
ineffectual
and
that
the
suspension
order
was
still
in
full
force
and
effect.
subsequently,
the
suspension
order
had
expired
by
its
own
terms.
it
was
not
a
continuing
order.
it
is
not
a
short-term
order
capable
of
repetition.
the
power
of
the
commission
over
that
order
was
exhausted
when
it
expired
by
its
own
terms
because
the
statute
stopped
it.
still
later,
the
commission
proceeded
with
its
investigation
and
has
entered
a
final
order,
finally
terminating
all
matters
at
issue
between
this,
these
appellees,
the
railroads
and
of
course
the
commission.
this
proceeding
attempts
only
to
ask
this
court
at
this
late
date
to
decide
whether
the
commission
had
power
to
vacate
an
order
which
by
subsequent
events
has
already
been
vacated.
now,
suppose
that
this
court
says
“yes,
you
had
the
power
to
vacate
that
order.”
now,
what
possible
good
is
it?
it
solves
nothing.
the
order
is
already
extinct.
it
has
already
expired.
it
is
nothing
except
as
a
guide
for
future
conduct.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
there
are
no
reparations,
mr.
justice
clark,
in
this
case.
the
only
thing
that
you
have
here
is
a
situation
where
the
railroads
might
say
that
they
are
entitled
to
collect
some
additional
money
from
the
--
from
the
shippers
in
the
event
we
are
right.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
i
have
not
been
advised.
i
would
assume,
sir
that
the
shippers
wouldn't
want
to
pay,
although,
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
brief,
these
shippers
were
there.
they
were
present
in
the
court
below.
one
of
them
made
an
affidavit
in
lieu
of
testimony
in
this
case
representing
an
association
that
ships
95%
of
all
the
carbon
black.so,
they
knew
what
the
facts
were
and
they
knew
what
the
situation
was
at
that
time.
i
would
say
--
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
no,
sir.
mr.
justice
clark
that's
--
that's
not
quite
the
--
the
way
it
is.
under
the
order
of
the
court,
they
collected
the
higher
rate,
you
see,
and
not
the
lower
rate
so
that
they
did
not
--
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
on
--
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
during
the
seven
weeks
period,
they
were
collecting
the
lower
rates
but
the
shippers
couldn't
defend
on
the
ground
we
were
paying
you
under
the
order
of
the
court
because
there
wasn't
any
order
of
the
court.
they
were
paying
only
reduced
--
the
reduced
rate.
now,
let
me
say
this.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
i
understand
that,
sir,
and
i
--
i
think
there
are
two
answers
to
it.
in
the
first
place,
those
people
are
not
parties
to
this
suit
and
as
i
see
the
rule
of
mootness
as
laid
down
by
prior
decision
to
this
court.
this
controversy
has
to
be
determined
or
has
to
be
judged
on
whether
or
not
there's
anything
that
the
parties
to
this
controversy
stand
to
gain
or
lose
by
it.
second,
if
there
be
any
--
three
things
--
secondly,
if
this
court
finds
that
this
case
is
moot
and
vacates
the
judgment
of
the
court
below,
as
it
usually
does,
you
are
going
to
have
the
--
all
of
that
situation
will
be
eliminated.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
would
be
the
same
as
though
there
have
been
--
never
been
a
law
suit.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
now,
thirdly,
any
controversy
that
can
be
settled
between
the
shippers
and
receivers
of
the
freight
and
the
railroads
could
not
be
settled
in
this
court.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
the
railroads
feel
that
it
would
be
unjust
for
them
to
collect
the
undercharges
that
might
exist,
all
they
need
do
is
to
apply
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
on
the
informal
docket
for
a
relief
from
--
and
for
permission
to
weigh
the
undercharges.
that's
frequently
done
because
it
operates
this
way
that
if
they
collect
the
undercharges,
the
commission
might
award
reparation
back
to
the
shipper
so
as
an
administrative
shortcut
when
they
have
a
situation
which
the
rails
and
carriers
and
the
shippers
think
is
obviously
unfair,
they
simply
go
to
the
commission.
the
commission
--
the
commission
decide
that
it
would
be
unfair
and
that
they
would
award
reparation
if
collected,
they
said
to
take
the
shortcut
and
authorize
the
railroads
to
weigh
the
undercharge
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
well,
that
maybe
--
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
no,
sir.
no
reliefs
again.
there'd
be
no
relief
against
me,
sir.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
well,
i
--
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
i
simply
say,
sir,
that
--
that
the
railroads
have
nothing
to
lose.
they
have
no
liability.
they're
not
liable
for
any
reparation
under
this.
in
--
in
that
connection,
mr.
chief
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
decision
of
this
court
in
alejandrino
against
quezon
which
just
came
to
my
attention
yesterday,
it's
in
271
u.s.
528.
the
--
this
court
did
say
in
that
connection
that
it
must
be
with
the
term
of
office,
i
mean
this
period
of
suspension
of
the
term
of
office
having
expired,
the
case
was
moved
even
though
the
question
of
whether
the
man
was
entitled
to
his
salary
during
that
time
have
not
been
determined
and
was
still
left
to
be
determined.
it
may
be
persuasive.
i
--
i
simply
want
to
conclude
my
remarks
this
way,
if
--
may
it
please
the
court,
because
my
time
is
about
up.
that
the
brief
--
my
brief
here
indicates
very
clearly
that
if
this
still
presents
a
justiciable
controversy,
the
action
of
the
court
below
needs
to
be
affirmed.
the
order
was
reviewable.
it's
impact
upon
the
petitioners
there
were
just
as
definite
and
certain
as
it
ever
would
be
when
we
went
to
the
court.
the
action
of
the
commission,
i
think
as
disclosed
by
the
record,
was
an
arbitrary
action
and
in
truth,
it
is
worthy
of
some
note
that
the
--
that
neither
the
briefs
nor
the
argument
make
any
real
effort
to
justify
de
facto
what
the
commission
did.
they
spend
their
time
arguing
that
it
was
not
reviewable.
the
question
of
the
injunction
of
the
rates
is
one
which
i
think
was
a
necessary
consequence
that
would
follow
the
--
judging
the
invalidity
of
the
order.
in
other
words,
once
we
concede
that
the
order
was
--
was
invalid
and
that
the
suspension
order
was
thereby
still
left
in
--
sorry.
mr.
ralph
w.
currie
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
then
we
have
--
then,
we
must
say
that
the
court
having
found
that
the
order
was
void,
then
these
rates
were
published
in
contravention
of
the
valid
suspension
order.
and
therefore,
the
court
would
be
under
a
duty
as
a
necessary
parallel
to
order
that
rates
filed
in
contravention
of
invalid
suspension
order
be
set
aside
and
not
used.
i
thank
you.
