mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
develop
briefly
with
the
time
alloted
some
of
the
questions
that
might
be
involved
on
the
mootness
issue
which
mr.
justice
harlan
raised
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
discussed.
i
think
the
best
way
to
--
to
follow
this
mootness
question
is
to
follow
the
chronology
of
the
case.
the
contention
of
these
appellee
seemed
to
be
that
the
question
of
mootness
arises
out
of
the
fact
that
since
the
suspension
order
of
september
the
23rd,
1955
expired
by
its
own
terms.
on
april
the
23rd,
1956,
some
seven
months
later,
that
the
entire
matter
then
came
to
a
rest
and
there
is
nothing
further
to
be
decided
or
there
is
now
not
left
any
justiciable
controversy
to
the
exploration
of
this
--
this
order.
now,
i
think
that
the
situation
can
best
be
illustrated
like
this.
following
the
vacation
of
the
suspension
by
the
commission
on
november
the
14th,
effective
as
of
november
the
24th,
the
rail
carriers
filed
a
supplement
putting
in
these
reduced
rates
and
they
became
effective
on
november
the
24th
and
they
were
affected
--
effective
for
nine
weeks
that
is
until
the
court
set
them
aside
in
their
judgment
of
january
the
24th.
now,
when
the
court
set
them
aside
on
january
the
24th,
it
did
not
say
"cancel
these
rates
as
of
this
moment.
leave
the
rates
that
were
in
effect
for
this
intervening
nine
weeks
period
in
effect."
they
said,
"no.
go
back
now
to
november
the
24th
and
the
rates
that
were
in
effect
at
that
time
should
have
been
in
effect
all
during
these
nine
weeks
period."
the
consequence
of
that,
insofar
as
the
railroads
are
concern,
is
that
we
have
undercharged
the
shippers.
since
we
charged
them
a
lower
basis
of
rate
for
that
nine-week
period,
then
the
court
said
we
should
have
charged
them.
now
then,
we
have
got
the
obligation
under
the
elkins
act
to
collect
those
undercharges
if
the
lower
court's
decision
is
correct
because
a
carrier
cannot
charge
any
shipper
anything
other
than
the
published
rate.
and
since
the
court
says
that
the
only
rate
that
was
published
in
this
case
was
the
rates
that
were
in
effect
prior
to
the
vacation
of
the
suspension.
now,
going
on
one
step
further,
that's
the
railroad's
position.
beginning
on
january
the
24th,
the
date
of
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
in
which
they
said,
"now,
go
back
to
november
the
24th
and
put
all
these
--
all
rates
back
into
existence.
that's
the
way
the
situation
should
be."
then
beginning
from
that
time
forward,
the
shippers
and
carriers
have
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
from
january
24th
to
the
exploration
suspension
order
whether
or
not
they
were
overcharged
because
you
see
the
court
has
reinstituted
the
higher
rates
or
reestablished
the
higher
rates
that
were
in
existence
as
of
that
date.
so
they
have
got
three
months,
so
what
they
view
as
overcharges
by
the
carrier.
now
then,
with
those
two
issues
in
the
matter,
it
is
not
a
moot
controversy.
there
is
something
to
be
decided
here
and
it's
a
very
same
consideration.
those
considerations,
the
very
same
consideration,
that
this
court
took
into
consideration
in
the
southern
pacific
case
and
the
--
which
is
not
cited
in
the
appellee's
brief
and
in
southern
pacific
company
against
icc
at
219
u.s.,
433.
now,
they
cited
--
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
--
a
case
called
the
southern
pacific
terminal
company
case
decided
on
the
same
day
by
this
court
but
they
did
not
cite
the
southern
pacific
company
against
the
icc
219.
now
in
that
case,
the
court
said
--
this
court
said,
the
contention
of
mootness
is
disposed
off
by
the
southern
pacific
terminal
company
case.
this,
they
decide.
they
went
on
--
this
court
went
on
to
say
in
addition
to
the
considerations
expressed
in
that
case,
it
is
to
be
observed
that
clearly
the
suggestion
of
mootness
is
without
merit
in
view
of
the
possible
liability
of
reparations
to
which
the
railroads
might
be
subjected
if
the
legality
of
the
order
were
not
determined.
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
no,
sir.
no
sir,
not
in
the
basis
for
attacking
the
reduced
rates
because
the
commission
entered
upon
a
formal
investigation
of
these
rates
--
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
--
and
upheld
hearings.
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
that
is
not
involved
here.
i
assume
they
could
claim
the
right
to
do
it
but
the
petition
for
reconsideration
on
that
investigation
by
the
commission
was
denied
in
november
--
on
november
the
19th,
1956
and
they
haven't
seen
fit
to
attack
it
yet.
but
i
don't
say
that
i
don't
assume
that
they
would
say
they
don't
have
the
right
even
yet
may
be.
maybe
latches
would
catch
them.
i
don't
know.
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
well,
certainly,
sir.
we
think
we
have
a
live
matter
to
decide
because
we
are
--
as
i
said,
the
railroads
are
placed
with
undercharges
for
nine
weeks
and
the
duty
of
collecting,
if
the
lower
court's
opinion
is
correct.
the
shippers
and
the
carriers
on
the
other
hand
are
faced
with
overcharges
for
a
period
of
three
months,
if
the
lower
court's
decision
is
incorrect.
now
then
--
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
well,
that's
true,
sir.
if
the
court
would
vacate
what
the
lower
court
has
done
in
order
to
set
the
record
straight,
it
would
not
--
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
but
we
would
be
back
sometime
later
with
the
same
problem
again
because
this
is
a
continuing
proposition
that
the
--
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
whether
the
order
of
the
commission
was
reviewable
and
whether
it
has
to
be
supported
by
fact.
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
oh,
i
understand.
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
i
understand
that.
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
now
then,
if
i
might
go
on
in
limited
time,
there
is
--
the
further
point
in
this
case
of
the
court
intruding
into
the
rate
making
function,
the
lower
court's
intrusion
into
that
function
by
setting
aside
rates
which
were
lawfully
in
effect
and
reestablishing
rates
which
had
been
cancelled.
now,
i
briefly
touch
on
it.
as
we
pointed
out,
the
challenged
order
of
november
14th
vacated
the
suspension
as
of
november
24th.
on
that
day,
these
reduced
rates
went
into
effect
and
were
in
effect
until
voided
by
lower
court's
opinion
in
january.
in
the
complaint
filed
in
this
case
by
the
appellees,
we
find
this
statement,
once
a
schedule
becomes
effective,
there
is
considerable
doubt
whether
even
a
subsequent
setting
aside
of
the
commission's
order
could
in
law
have
the
effect
of
cancelling
the
schedules
in
effect.
now,
we
have
agreed
with
that
contention
ever
since
we
have
been
proceeding
in
this
case.
we
think
that
is
a
sound
contention.
it
is
a
contention
that
was
raised
by
the
appellees
in
order
to
prevail
upon
the
lower
court
to
grant
him
a
temporary
restraining
order
which
he
denied.
the
commission's
power
to
set
aside
rates,
which
is
touched
on
by
mr.
ginnane
which
are
already
in
effect,
is
limited
by
these
restrictions
of
section
15
including
the
requirements
of
a
full
hearing.
now,
to
compel,
as
this
lower
court
would
do,
the
commission
to
take
such
action
without
a
full
hearing
would
be
to
telling
the
commission
to
disregard
their
statutory
limitations
and
proceed
as
the
court
direct.
now
then,
the
grant
of
power
to
the
commission
to
suspend
rates
prior
to
their
effective
date
was
itself
innovation
or
radical
departure
by
the
mann-elkins
act.
it
represented
as
mr.
ginnane
has
already
stated
an
exception
to
this
traditional
right
of
the
carriers
to
initiate
their
--
all
rates.
but
the
effect
of
this
lower
court's
decision
is
to
suspend
rates
after
they
have
gone
into
effect
but
prior
to
a
full
hearing
which
the
commission
is
not
even
empowered
by
the
act
to
do.
if
the
commission's
orders,
when
it
gets
into
a
question
of
reasonableness
of
rates,
other
than
on
the
reparation
issue,
they
do
not
cancel
rates
retroactively.
they
order
them
cancel
if
they
find
them
unreasonable
and
unjust
prospectively
but
not
retroactively.
but
this
court
has
gone
one
step
further
and
ordered
them
cancelled
retroactively
before
april
hearing.
now,
when
they
get
into
a
situation
of
that
nature,
they
are
actually
in
the
field
of
rate
making
because
they
are
establishing
rates
which
the
commission
has
not
established,
which
the
carriers
have
not
established
and
they
are
actually
putting
those
rates
into
the
book
entirely
contrary
to
any
authority
even
resting
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
i
believe
that
my
time
is
up.
we
submit
--
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
how
had
they
had
been
fixed?
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
they
had
been
fixed
by
the
publication
of
tariff
under
section
6
(3)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
published
on
statutory
notice
and
allowed
to
go
into
effect
because
they
were
not
suspended
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
no,
sir.as
far
as
i
know,
the
rates
that
were
in
effect
prior
to
this
reduction
had
not
been
challenged.
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
there
may
have
been
a
request
for
a
protest
filed
against
them
but
it
wasn't
successful.
now,
i
don't
--
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
they
had
been
in
effect
since
the
early
report
on
1954.
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
actually,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
it
is
not.
the
--
the
motivating
factor
behind
this
case
was
large
competition.
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
the
united
states
--
rubber
company
had
developed
a
rubber
container
for
the
shipping
of
carbon
black.
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
right,
sir.
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
to
initiate
rates,
sir?
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
yes,
sir.
they
have
the
same
power
we
do,
of
course,
subject
to
the
control
of
the
regulatory
agency.
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
but
--
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
you're
speaking
with
the
boards
line,
sir?
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
we
have
the
same
proceeding
before
the
icc
if
that's
what
you
mean.
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
yes,
sir.
i
wish
i
had
time
to
develop
it
for
you
and
if
you
bear
with
me,
that
illustrates
the
inappropriateness
of
a
trial
court
getting
into
these
matters.
the
truck
line
rates
had
been
suspended
by
the
commission
but
involved
in
that
case
was
whether
or
not
they
were
compensatory
which
is
the
first
test
of
a
rate,
involved
in
that
case
were
certain
other
factors.
what
the
truck
lines
would
--
been
doing
was
trying
to
establish
on
a
28,000
pound
minimum,
the
same
level
of
rates
that
the
railroads
published
on
a
65,000
pound
minimum.
and
those
were
factors
and
considerations
which
the
commission
had
first
been
confronted
with
and
they
wanted
the
right
to
look
at.
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
now,
the
factors
were
entirely
different
between
the
railroad
case
and
the
motor
carrier
case.
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
well,
since
that
time,
their
motor
carriers
have
reduced
their
rates
and
i
think
the
figure
you
are
mentioning
is
from
an
origin
in
the
panhandle
texas
to
akron,
ohio
and
i
believe
their
rates
on
100
pounds
is
1.4785
and
ours
is
now
1.33.
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
again
--
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
--
justice
--
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
they
have.
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
they
had
a
change
pending
at
the
time
we
made
our
change.
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
after
a
full
investigation,
yes,
sir.
it
was
effective
on
december
the
14th
i
believe
--
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
--
just
two
days
after
the
hearing
in
this
case.
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
they
did
--
they
suspended
their
rates
on
our
protest.
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
the
icc
--
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
--
back
in
1954
because
as
i
mentioned
to
him,
there
were
certain
factors
and
considerations
which
we
call
to
their
attention
and
they
ordered
the
right
to
look
at
it.
they
involved
making
rates
on
much
lower
minimums
than
the
real
carriers
that
made
these
rates
applicable.
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
well,
it
lasted,
of
course,
for
seven
months
under
--
under
--
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
--
the
act
but
it
was
voluntarily
extended
until
december
--
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
i'm
talking
about
the
motor
carrier.
i
don't
know
the
beginning
date
but
the
commission
finally
decided
the
case,
that
is
the
reasonableness
of
this
case,
on
december
the
14th,
1955.
now,
i
think
they
had
been
suspended
since
--
probably
around
april
or
may
of
1954.
and
please
don't
--
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
--
hang
me
on
that
particular
date
around
in
that
time.
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
if
the
rate
is
once
suspended,
yes.
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
it
could
be
when
there
are
innovations.
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
i'll
put
it
that
way,
if
it's
not.
if
there
are
no
innovations
in
the
case,
then
they
can
decide
it
much
faster.
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
well,
beginning
in
1954
as
the
appellee's
brief
will
show,
using
again
this
representative
rate
from
texas
panhandle
to
akron,
ohio,
their
rates
were
3
cents
lower
than
our
in
1954.
beginning
in
1954,
we
put
a
rate
in
of
$1.4785
which
made
our
rate
5.15
cents
lower
than
theirs.
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
no,
sir.
then
we
came
along
in
order
to
meet
some
barge
competition
put
in
a
rate
of
133
per
100
pounds
for
that
the
same
representative
origin
or
destination.
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
sir?
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
they
were
much
lower
than
that,
sir,
on
--
on
100
pound
basis
--
on
a
100
pound
basis
from
the
areas
around
the
mississippi
up
to
--
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
[laughs].
he
claims
we
got
an
advantage,
sir.
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
because
--
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
--
his
rates
were
suspended
and
ours
weren't.
mr.
william
r.
mcdowell
not
any
further.
the
only
rate
was
--
the
rates
were
involved
were
the
ones
that
were
not
suspended.
in
other
words,
we
didn't
go
back
and
asked
to
put
in
another
scale
of
rates
to
cut
further.
but
he
says,
his
were
suspended
and
ours
weren't
and
we
have
the
advantage
during
this
interim.
