mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
appellants
of
the
united
states
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
the
appellants,
railroads,
are
represented
by
mr.
mcdowell
with
whom
i
have
agreed
on
the
division
of
argument
and
the
division
at
the
time,
if
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
a
three-judge
district
court
sitting
in
the
northern
district
of
texas.
in
general,
the
questions
are
whether
the
district
court
aired
in
undertaking
to
review
an
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
vacating
a
prior
rate
suspension
order.
secondly,
in
setting
aside
of
that
order
for
lack
of
findings
and
third
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
lack
of
findings.
and
third,
in
suspending
or
enjoining
the
use
of
carrier
initiated
rates
after
they
had
gone
into
effect.
now,
these
questions
go
to
the
heart
of
the
statutory
procedure
for
the
making
and
suspension
of
rates.
and
that
the
court
will
permit,
instead
of
going
into
the
immediate
facts
and
issues
of
the
case
at
the
outset,
i
think
it
will
be
helpful
if
i
outline
first
that
general
statutory
procedure
for
the
initiation
and
the
suspension
of
rate.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
sir.
this
case
involves
rail
rates
and
therefore,
the
rate
provisions
of
part
one
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
but
similar
provisions
appear
in
parts
two,
three
and
four
dealing
with
the
rates
of
motor
carriers,
water
carriers
and
freight
forwarders.
the
act
generally
contemplates
that
rates
will
be
established
upon
the
initiative
of
the
carriers
by
filing
with
the
commission
and
publishing
tariffs
containing
the
new
or
changed
rates.
thus,
paragraph
3
of
section
6
provides
that
the
railroads
may
file
tariffs
embodying
rate
changes
to
become
effective
upon
30
days
notice
to
the
commission
and
to
the
public,
unless
the
commission
in
its
discretion
and
for
good
cause
shown
allow
such
great
changes
to
be
made
on
less
than
30
days
notice.
now,
prior
to
1910,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
had
no
power
to
prevent
railroad
initiated
rates
from
becoming
effective.
it
could
only
set
them
aside
as
unlawful
after
a
full
hearing.
it
was
in
the
mann-elkins
act
of
1910
for
the
first
time
that
congress
empowered
the
commission
to
suspend
railroad
initiated
rates
before
they
became
effective
and
for
a
specified
period
pending
an
investigation
by
the
commission
into
the
lawfulness
of
the
rates.
that
statutory
period
of
suspension
has
--
has
been
changed
by
congress
from
time
to
time.
and
at
the
present
time
under
section
15
paragraph
(7)
of
the
act,
the
commission
may
suspend
rail
rates
for
a
period
not
to
exceed
in
seven
months.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
option
of
what
you've
said
is
that
on
the
--
prior
to
mann-elkins,
a
rate
could
be
put
enforce
would
be
collected
x
years,
sometimes
years
might
elapse
before
the
rate
challenge
is
unreasonable.
it
would
then
be
set
as
--
then
that'd
be
an
order
which
we
get
into
court
in
some
more
time
and
if
eventually
the
--
the
commission's
order
were
sustained
preparation
proceedings
that
may
begun
for
the
past
payments,
is
that
right?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
if
the
parties
had
survived.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
originally,
it
applied
only
to
rate
increases.
as
we
came
into
an
era
of
severe
carrier
competition,
the
statute
was
amended
to
apply
to
rate
reductions
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
as
well
as
freight
rates.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
mann-elkins
is
applied
only
to
the
suspension
of
the
rate
increases.
and
later,
it
was
amended
to
apply
to
rate
decreases.
and
the
only
condition
in
the
statute
upon
the
--
upon
the
suspension
of
a
rate
is
that
the
commission
shall
deliver
to
the
carrier
or
carriers
effected
thereby
a
statement
in
writing
of
the
reasons
for
its
suspension.
and
there
is
no
requirement
of
a
hearing
prior
to
the
exercise
of
the
suspension
power.
at
the
end
of
the
seven-month
period
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
without
--
without
any
prior
notice
or
hearing.
in
that
--
in
that
connection,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
at
the
present
time,
the
commission
exercises
its
rate
suspension
powers,
almost
entirely
upon
the
application
of
shipping
or
competing
carriers
that
rather
than
upon
its
own
motion.
at
the
end
of
the
seven-month
suspension
period,
the
railroad
may
make
--
put
the
rates
into
effect
without
winning
for
the
completion
of
the
commission's
investigation
if
it's
still
going
on.
and
once
the
rates
have
become
effective,
the
carrier
must
observe
under
the
provisions
of
section
6.
i
should
say
that
almost
identical
rate
suspension
provisions
appear
in
the
natural
gas
act,
the
federal
power
act,
the
communications
act
and
the
civil
aeronautics
act.
the
commission
has
created
both
an
organization
and
the
procedure
for
handling
these
rate
suspension
matters.
pursuant
to
its
delegation
powers
under
section
17,
it
has
delegated
to
the
board
of
suspension,
consisting
of
five
employees
of
the
commission,
the
power
to
act
upon
protest,
as
they
are
called,
which
seek
the
suspension
of
rates.
both
protestants
and
the
respondent
carriers
may
appeal
from
the
decision
of
the
board
of
suspension
to
division
2
of
the
commission,
division
2
consisting
of
three
members
of
the
commission
who
are
responsible
under
the
full
commission
for
rate
matters
generally.
by
regulations
published
in
the
federal
register,
the
commission
has
prescribed
the
procedure
which
i
would
like
to
describe
very
briefly.
these
regulations
provide
that
the
proceedings
before
the
board
of
suspension
shall
be
informal.
no
transcription
of
its
proceedings
is
made,
subpoenas
are
not
issued,
olds
are
not
administered.
protest
must
be
in
writing
or
in
emergencies
in
telegraphic
form.
they
must
be
filed
with
the
commission
and
served
upon
the
carrier
which
initiated
the
rates,
at
least
12
days
before
the
effective
date
of
the
rates.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
a
notice
is
put
on
the
tariff
file.
a
notice
is
put
in
the
tariff
file,
the
commission's
tariff
file.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
a
shipper
--
under
the
commission's
tariff
rules,
the
carrier
is
required
to
file
a
supplement
and
that
supplement
must
be
filed
both
with
the
commission
and
with
the
--
the
various
(inaudible)
stations,
the
court
has
published
the
tariffs.
thus,
you'll
find
the
supplement
that
--
that
carrying
notice
of
the
suspension
in
the
same
place
so
that
you
find
the
tariff
itself.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
believe
me,
sir,
the
--
the
organized
shipper
groups
and
the
organized
competing
carrier
groups
watch
these
things
on
the
power
to
our
basis.
and
the
carrier
may
file
a
reply
to
the
protest,
whereas
in
the
instant
case,
the
suspension
board
refuses
to
suspend
rates.
the
protestants
or
their
shippers
or
competing
carriers
may
file
with
division
2,
a
petition
for
reconsideration
which
must
be
filed
at
least
two
days
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
tariffs.
both
the
board
and
the
division
act
upon
the
basis
of
written
protest
and
written
replies
frequently
supplemented
by
informal
conferences
with
the
board.
and
it's
very
significant,
we
think,
for
the
issues
in
this
case
to
note
that
the
commission's
procedure
in
order
to
give
shippers
and
competing
carries
an
opportunity
to
look
at
the
new
tariffs
and
to
formulate
their
protest,
the
result
of
that
is
the
statutory
period
of
30
days
is
now
down
to
a
period
of
12
days,
sometimes
a
little
more
for
consideration
by
the
commission.
and
this
12-day
period
must
include
the
carrier's
opportunity
to
reply
to
the
protest,
deliberation
and
decision
by
the
suspension
board
and
appeal
to
and
decision
by
division
2.
also,
this
organization
must
operate
not
only
rapidly
but
to
handle
a
large
volume
of
matters.
we
point
out
in
our
brief
that
during
the
year
ended
october
31,
1955,
4800
protests
were
filed
against
4000
tariffs
of
rail
motor
and
water
carriers.
of
these
2100
were
suspended
in
whole
or
in
part,
1300
were
permitted
to
become
effective
and
600
were
withdrawn
for
one
reason
or
another,
such
as
the
tariff
was
withdrawn
or
the
protests
were
withdrawn.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
applies
to
the
rates
of
freight
forwarders.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
four
chapters.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
including
part
four
dealing
with
freight
forwarders.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
sir.
the
suspension
board
in
relation
to
handle
all
four
types
of
rate
matters.
so
in
the
brief,
the
suspension
procedure
is
characterized
by
informality,
speed
of
decision
and
a
tremendous
volume
of
rates.
now,
in
the
instant
case,
the
appellant,
railroads,
on
or
about
august
12,
1955
filed
reduced
rates
on
carbon
black
moving
from
texas
and
adjacent
points
to
consuming
centers
in
the
north
such
as
akron,
ohio.
and
these
rates
were
to
become
effective
on
september
24.
on
september
8,
10
and
11,
several
motor
carrier
rate
bureaus
and
one
motor
carrier
filed
protest
with
the
commission.
on
september
22,
two
days
before
the
rates
were
to
become
effective,
the
suspension
--
the
suspension
board
refused
to
suspend
but
directed
an
investigation
into
the
rates.
the
protestants
appeal
immediately
to
division
2
which
on
september
23,
the
day
before
the
rates
were
to
become
effective,
suspended
the
rates
for
the
full
statutory
period
of
seven
months
which
would
have
suspended
them
until
april
23,
1956.
following
month
in
october
1955,
the
appellant,
railroads,
petitioned
division
2
for
reconsideration
and
for
vacation
of
its
suspension
order.
and
on
november
14,
division
2
entered
a
second
order
vacating
its
prior
suspension
order
as
of
november
24
but
continuing
the
investigation
into
the
lawfulness
of
the
rates.
on
november
23,
the
present
action
was
commenced
by
the,
appellee
motor
carriers
in
the
texas
court.
and
on
that
same
day,
november
23,
the
day
before
the
rates
were
to
become
effective,
judge
atwell
denied
their
application
for
a
temporary
restraining
order.
after
a
hearing
before
the
three-judge
court,
it
rendered
its
judgment
on
january
24,
which
set
aside
as
void
ab
initio,
the
commission's
order
of
november
14
vacating
its
prior
suspension
order.
remanding
the
matter
to
the
commission
for
further
proceedings
as
though
the
order
of
november
14,
1955
had
never
been
entered
and
prohibiting
use
of
a
new
reduced
rates
on
carbon
black
under
the
suspension
order
until
the
suspension
order
shall
have
been
rescinded
or
modified
by
lawful
action
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
the
judgment
is
set
forth
on
the
record
at
page
61.
the
district
court
set
aside
the
commission's
order
which
vacated
its
prior
--
prior
suspension
order
on
the
ground
that
the
vacating
order
was
not
accompanied
by
sufficient
findings.
we
contend,
first
of
all,
that
the
commission's
order
vacating
the
prior
suspension
order
was
not
subject
to
review
at
all.
and
later,
we
will
contend
that
even
assuming
that
it
was
subject
to
review
that
the
vacating
order
was
not
required
to
be
accompanied
by
findings.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
only
thing
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
only
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
the
nearest
thing
there
is
to
set
your
requirement
of
the
statute
is
the
requirement
in
the
suspension
provision
on
paragraph
7
of
section
15.
that
if
the
commission
suspends,
it
shall
give
a
statement
or
written
statement
of
its
reasons
for
suspending
to
the
carrier
whose
rates
are
suspended,
otherwise,
the
rate
provisions
of
the
act
are
silent
as
to
reasons
or
findings.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
at
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
beginning
at
the
bottom
of
page
5
of
the
record,
paragraph
--
beginning
about
six
lines
in
the
bottom
of
page
and
contending
to
the
top
of
page
6.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
would
be
in
our
brief
at
page
47
beginning
about
the
fifth
line
on
top
of
the
page,
and
pending
such
hearing
and
the
decision
thereon,
commission
upon
filing
with
such
schedule
and
delivering
to
the
carrier
or
carriers
effected
thereby
a
statement
in
writing
of
its
reasons
for
such
suspension.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
court
below
said
that
our
order
vacating
the
suspension
order
must
be
--
must
be
accompanied
by
findings.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
based
that
variously
on
the
administrative
procedure
act
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
and
such
decisions
of
this
court
as
florida.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
first
of
all
--
first
of
all,
we
will
contend
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
that
the
order
was
not
reviewable.
secondly,
assuming
reviewability
that
the
order
should
not
have
been
set
aside
and
that
findings
were
not
required.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
we
would
think
not,
although
that
issue
is
not
before
the
court,
strictly
speaking.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
i
gather
it's
conceded
that
the
vacation
order
was
not
supported
by
affirmative
findings.
we
would
say
that
the
commission
made
clear
a
--
a
finding
in
this
sense
that
upon
reconsideration
of
its
suspension
order
but
the
mere
fact
of
vacating
it.
it
was
in
effect
saying
that
it
was
not
sufficiently
clear,
it
was
not
sufficient
--
it
wasn't
sufficiently
convinced
that
the
rates
were
probably
unlawful
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
to
justify
interference
with
the
carrier
statutory
right
to
initiate
its
finding.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
in
effect,
the
commission
said
after
considering
the
petition
for
reconsideration,
and
the
reply
is
that
--
and
the
replies
to
those
petitions
and
for
a
good
cause,
we
vacate
our
prior
part.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
practically
verbatim,
sir.
first,
we
contend
that
the
order
was
not
reviewable
at
all.
we
submit
that
the
rate
suspension
power
was
deliberately
entrusted
by
congress
to
the
exclusive
discretion
of
the
commission.
and
starting
with
the
language
of
the
statute
itself,
paragraph
7
of
section
15,
it
says
that
the
commission
may
suspend
rates
and
that
wasn't
just
an
--
an
accidental
choice
of
words
as
between
“may”
and
“shall”
because
the
report
of
the
senate
committee
on
interstate
commerce
in
reporting
the
original
mann-elkins
bill
says
that
the
commission
should,
in
its
discretion,
be
empowered
to
suspend
rates
pending
investigation.
and
until
the
instant
case,
the
lower
federal
courts
had
consistently
refused
to
review
in
the
commission
orders
suspending
rates
and
in
one
case
in
order
vacating
a
prior
suspension
order.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
think
so,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
i'm
afraid
of
that
word
"never."
and
later,
i
shall
discuss
briefly
two
cases
which
came
up
under
the
federal
power
and
--
and
where
--
what
--
which
involved
rate
suspension
matters
to
be
sure,
but
it
went
right
to
the
heart
of
whether
the
--
the
commission
in
those
cases
had
authority
to
act
at
all.
in
one
case,
the
issue
was
whether
it
had
the
suspended
rates
for
longer
than
the
period
permitted
by
congress.
i
don't
challenge
that
result.
what
we
contend
is
that
here
where
the
commission
is
exercising
a
power
which
it
admittedly
has
enacting
within
the
statutory
limits
of
that
power
that
congress
intended
it
to
be
unreviewable.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
certainly.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
to
begin
with,
your
honor,
the
question
has
not
been
before
this
court.
there
are
several
cases
cited
in
our
brief,
three-judge
courts
prior
to
this
case
had
refused
to
--
had
refused
to
review
orders
denying
suspension
or
vacating
prior
suspension
orders.
and
they
did
so
specifically
on
the
ground
that
this
rate
suspension
orders
were
entrusted
entirely
to
the
discretion
of
the
commission
and
were
not
subject
to
review.
now,
following
this
case,
there
have
been
two
cases
following
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right.
now,
i
should
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
i
should
to
refer
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
after
a
hearing.
following
the
decision
in
this
case,
the
same
court
in
the
dixie
carriers
case,
which
the
government
has
also
appealed
to
this
court,
arrived
at
the
same
result.
and
the
three-judge
court
in
--
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
the
long
island
railroad
case
also
followed
at
the
instant
case.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it's
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york,
the
long
island
railroad
company
against
united
states.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
don't
have
an
official
citation
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
decided
on
may
9,
1956.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
subsequent
to
the
decision
in
this
case.
then,
there
had
been
those
two
federal
power
commission
cases
involving
what
seemed
to
us
to
be
entirely
--
an
entirely
different
sort
of
thing,
that
jurisdiction
to
suspend
it
all.
and
then,
there
have
been
three
cases
decided
this
past
year
by
the
fifth
circuit
under
the
natural
gas
act.
it
was
probably
a
large
group
of
cases
under
the
natural
gas
act
in
which
this
court
denied
certiorari
a
few
months
ago.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
sir,
judge
brown
of
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
long
--
long
island
railroad
company
v.
united
states.
we
would
be
glad
to
--
to
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
don't
think
it's
there.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
judges
were
--
district
judges
byers
and
bruchhausen
with
judge
swan
dissenting.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
they
very
largely
followed
this
case.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
we
will
be
glad
listen
to
them.
it
is
in
140
f.supp.,
but
i'm
sorry
none
of
us
have
the
page
number,
140
f.supp.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
long
island
railroad
company
v.
united
states.
page
823,
we
finally
have
it,
140
f.supp.,
823.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
also,
we
think
it's
settled
beyond
citation
that
the
federal
courts
will
not
review
preliminary,
procedural
or
interlocutory
orders
of
federal
agencies.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
actual
discretion
in
suspending
or
refusing
to
suspend
the
rate
or
in
vacating
a
prior
suspension
order
is
merely
preliminary
and
ancillary
to
its
full
and
formal
investigation
and
to
whether
the
rates
are
lawful.
and
that's
emphasized
by
the
fact
that
in
making
these
suspension
decisions,
the
commission
must
act
informally
or
rapidly
on
the
basis
of
admitted
what
often
turns
out
to
be
incomplete
information.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
if
this
is
--
let
me
practice.
at
--
at
the
present
time
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
correct,
sir.
but
i
should
give
you
this
by
way
of
background.
that
at
--
that
in
recent
years,
the
great
majority
of
these
rate
suspension
matters
endowed
rate
decreases.
and
of
course,
there
is
no
way
of
whether
the
commission
suspends
or
does
not
suspend
that
there's
no
way
it
can
protect
the
initiating
carrier
or
the
competing
carrier
against
lost
in
the
event
the
commission
has
made
a
mistake
in
suspending
or
not
suspending.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it's
a
delicate
drastic
power.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
now,
they
mentioned
in
response
to
mr.
justice
douglas
question,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
has
recently
held
in
the
group
of
cases
under
the
natural
gas
act
that
orders
of
the
federal
power
commission
suspending
rates
are
not
subject
to
judicial
review.
and
one
of
those
cases,
the
humble
oil
&
refining
case,
in
which
this
court
denied
certiorari,
the
fifth
circuit
characterized
this
type
of
order
in
words
which
we
think
fit
here
better
than
anything
we
can
say.
it
said,
"the
order
in
question
is
in
no
proper
sense,
a
definitive
order.
it
is
a
mere
procedural
step
taking
at
the
inception
of
and
not
upon
the
completion
of
the
administrative
process."
a
realistic
appraise
of
the
order
and
the
function
it
performs
demonstrates
that
it
is
interlocutory
and
that
its
issuance
had
but
one
objective
in
view
to
maintain
the
status
quo
between
the
seller
and
purchaser
pending
the
exercise
of
the
commission
statutory
jurisdiction
to
inquire
the
lawfulness
of
the
rates.
in
this
discretionary
and
preliminary
character
of
rate
suspension
actions,
it
seems
to
us,
is
emphasized
by
the
fact
that
congress
has
provided
two
full
administrative
remedies
for
shippers
and
carriers
who
are
--
who
object
to
new
rates.
in
this
case,
the
appellee
motor
carriers
could
have
participated
and
--
and
in
fact,
they
did
participate
in
the
commission's
full
investigation
and
hearing
of
the
lawfulness
of
these
new
rail
rates.
moreover,
if
the
commission
had
not
instituted
an
investigation
under
section
15,
as
it
did,
if
it
had
not
done
so,
then
the
objective
motor
carriers
or
any
shippers
who
wanted
to
object
could
have
filed
a
formal
complaint
with
the
commission
under
section
13.
and
the
commission
would
have
been
required
to
undertake
a
full
investigation
in
hearing
into
the
lawfulness
of
the
rates.
and
this
court
held
long
ago
in
united
states
v.
merchants
association
in
243
u.s.,
that
these
remedies
provided
by
sections
13
and
15
are
administrative
remedies
which
must
be
exhausted
by
shippers
and
by
carriers
before
they
can
invoke
judicial
remedies.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
will
--
that
was
laid
down
in
that
case
in
a
more
drastic
situation
on
this.
that
was
a
case
where
involving
the
long-haul,
short-haul
provisions
of
the
act.
intermediate
communities
and
shippers
protested.
the
commission
has
granted
relief
from
the
section
4
prohibition
against
charging
more
for
a
long-haul
than
for
a
shorter
haul.
and
this
court
held
that
not
even
the
intervening
communities
and
shippers
could
challenge
the
section
4
order.
there
was
no
question
but
that
they
were
effective,
but
they
must
exhaust
their
remedy
either
under
section
13
or
under
section
15
before
they
could
come
in
to
court.
we
submit
that
the
cases
relied
upon
by
the
appellees
as
supporting
their
reviewability
of
suspension
actions
are
easily
distinguished.
and
i'll
mention
just
one
for
an
example.
that's
the
utah
fuel
company
v.
bituminous
coal
commission
at
306
of
this
court's
reports.
that
case
on
its
face
involved
the
claim
of
injury
of
a
type
which
as
this
court
recognized,
congress
had
not
provided
any
remedy.
in
contrast
here,
congress
has
provided
remedies
in
sections
13
and
15
of
the
act
which
this
court,
50
years
ago,
said
it
must
be
exhausted.
however,
the
appellee's
most
specific
reliance
is
upon
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
in
the
atlantic
seaboard
corporation
case
and
the
tenth
circuit's
decision,
in
the
phillips
petroleum
v.
federal
power
commission.
now,
the
atlantic
seaboard
corporation
case
involved
the
issue
of
whether
the
federal
power
commission
had
suspended
rates
for
longer
than
the
five-month
period
authorized
by
the
natural
gas
act.
the
phillips
case
involved
the
question
whether
the
federal
power
commission's
rate
suspension
power
could
be
applied
to
rate
increases
which
resulted
from
an
escalator
clause
in
a
contract
which
was
in
effect
prior
to
this
court's
basic
decision
in
phillips
petroleum
v.
state
of
wisconsin.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
those
cases
are
distinguishable
and
that
they
can
go
right
to
the
question
of
whether
the
commission
is
--
as
to
whether
agency
was
acting
within
its
statutory
authority,
within
the
statutory
jurisdiction,
whereas
this
case
involves
the
exercise
of
admitted
power
to
suspend.
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
particularly
at
pages
53
and
55,
in
the
case
that
it
thought
that
section
10
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
subjected
orders
such
as
rate
suspension
orders
to
review.
we
disagree.
in
our
brief,
we
point
out
that
the
review
provision
of
section
10
of
the
apa,
a
purport
by
the
introductory
clause
accepts
so
far
as
statutes
preclude
judicial
review
and
to
agency
action
is
by
law
committed
to
agency
discretion.
we
point
out
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
in
a
serious
of
recent
cases
that
this
introductory
clause
--
clauses
limit
and
qualify
the
other
provisions
of
section
10.
we
also
point
out
that
section
10
specifically
avoids
making
it
reviewable,
the
preliminary
and
procedural
interlocutory
orders
of
agencies.
thus,
section
10
(c)
provides
that
such
orders
shall
be
directly
reviewable
by
the
courts
only
where
congress
so
prescribes
and
congress
has
not
so
required
here.
and
on
the
last
term,
this
court
noted
in
the
colorado
interstate
gas
case,
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
purports
to
strengthen
them
but
rather
than
to
weaken
the
rule
that
administrative
remedies
must
be
exhausted
before
it
resort
to
judicial
remedies.
and
so
we
submit
that
nothing
in
the
law,
either
in
the
administrative
procedure
act
or
into
the
whole
body
of
law
developed
by
this
court
on
--
to
reviewability
of
agency
action
supports
the
decision
below
that
the
commission's
order
vacating
a
prior
suspension
order
was
reviewable.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
pursue
the
remedies
which
congress
has
given
them
under
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
participate
in
the
commission's
formal
proceeding
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
during
in
the
law
--
into
lawfulness
of
the
rates.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
same
as
there's
nothing
private
litigants
and
--
and
--
before
the
courts
can
--
can
do
when
judge
grants
or
refuses
to
grant
a
temporary
restraining
order
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
to
the
most
extraordinary
situations,
there
is
no
appeal.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
is
quite
correct.
my
colleague,
mr.
mcdowell,
in
his
portion
of
our
argument
will
--
will
point
out
that
the
practical
consequences
are
trying
to
fit
the
most
limited
form
of
judicial
review
into
the
statutory
time
--
timetable
for
--
for
making
the
rates
and
for
the
exercise
of
the
suspension
power.
the
dilemma
has
created
for
all
the
concerned.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
on
november
23,
the
complaint
was
filed.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
1955.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
--
the
commission
continued
with
the
full
investigation
and
hearing.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
--
and
quite
a
few
months
ago,
the
rates
here
involved
were
sustained
as
lawful.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
indeed.
we
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
as
far
as
this
litigation
is
concern,
the
question
is
alive
as
we
see
it.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
was
--
was
deliberately
framed.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
it
was
deliberately
framed
to
set
aside
the
commission's
order
vacating
its
prior
suspension
order
ab
initio,
to
restore
things
as
they
were
as
though
the
vacation
order
had
never
been
entered.
and
that
as
a
result,
the
railroads
are
--
are
under
an
obligation
to
collect
from
their
shippers
that
during
the
period
of
some
weeks
that
the
new
reduced
rates
were
in
effect.
the
difference
between
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
former
higher
charges
and
the
--
the
reduced
rates
which
were
later
filed.
so,
it's
--
what
seemed
to
be
far
from
academic
with
respect
to
the
railroads
whose
rates
were
involved.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
--
if
this
gentleman
stays
in
effect.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
railroads
are
obligated
to
collect
from
the
shippers,
from
their
shippers.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
they
ship
on
--
on
the
reduced
rates
during
the
period
that
they
were
in
effect
prior
to
the
judgment
of
this
case.
the
difference
between
the
--
the
former
higher
rates
which
were
in
effect
and
the
lower
rate
--
and
the
lower
rates
which
they
filed
with
the
commission
and
which
are
the
subjects
of
litigation.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
we
haven't
--
we
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well
--
well,
they
have
--
they
have
two
years.
the
railroads
have
two
years
for
which
they
collect.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
amount
to
a
rebate.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
willful
rebating
is
a
criminal
violation
of
the
elkins
act.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
oh,
but
an
order
which
was
set
aside
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
ab
initio,
an
order
which
was
set
aside
ab
initio.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
this
order
had
never
been
entered.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
they
could
--
we
could
not
prosecute
them
just
forthwith
but
if
--
if
this
judgment
is
sustained
by
this
court
and
--
and
within
a
reasonable
time,
they
do
not
undertake
to
--
to
collect
what
would
amount
to
undercharges
under
the
judgment
here
before
the
court,
i
suppose
we'll
have
to
look
at
the
elkins
act.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
at
the
same
time,
i
would
recommend
to
the
commission
that
--
that
assuming
this
judgment
were
affirmed,
i
would
recommend
to
the
commission
to
take
no
action
until
a
railroad
has
had
an
opportunity
to
voluntarily
to
let
themselves.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
but
assuming
reviewability,
we
still
think
that
the
commission's
order
of
vacating
its
prior
suspension
order
should
not
have
been
set
aside
on
the
ground
that
it
lacked
findings.
the
suspension
order
of
september
23
contained
the
statement
which
appears
in
the
record
at
page
45
and
at
further
appearing
that
upon
consideration
of
the
said
schedules
and
protest
thereto,
there
is
reason
to
believe
when
the
commission
didn't
say
"we
find
that."
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
they
would
if
permitted
to
become
effective
result
in
rates
and
charges
which
would
be
unjust
and
unreasonable
in
violation
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
constitute
unfair
and
destructive
competitive
practices
in
contravention
of
the
national
transportation
policy.
the
later
order
of
november
14,
vacating
the
prior
suspension
order,
contains
the
following
statement
which
appears
at
page
47
of
the
record.
it
further
appearing
that
consideration
has
been
given
to
petitions
of
the
respondents
requesting
vacation
of
the
order
suspension
and
to
replies
thereto
and
good
cause
appearing
therefore.
now,
the
district
court
based
its
conclusion
on
several
--
on
several
factors.
first,
it
said
that
the
vacating
order
should
have
been
accompanied
by
findings
so
as
to
facilitate
judicial
review,
so
that
our
reviewing
court
would
understand
the
reasons
for
the
commission's
action.
but
it's
cited
as
authority
for
them,
only
a
group
of
cases
such
as
this
court's
decision
in
florida
v.
united
states
which
stand
for
the
proposition
that
such
findings
are
required
to
support
a
final
order
made
after
the
receipt
of
evidence
in
a
hearing.
no
one
of
those
cases
relied
upon
by
the
district
court
stands
for
the
proposition
that
preliminary
tentative
orders
such
as
these
suspension
actions
must
be
accompanied
by
findings.
and
also
as
we
contend
that
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
judicial
review
here
to
be
facilitated
by
findings
and
--
and
the
conventional
sense
of
the
word.
secondly,
the
court
below
held
that
a
requirement
of
findings
was
contained
in
section
8
(b)
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
but
the
finding's
requirements
of
section
8
(b)
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
applies
only
to
orders
issued
after
a
hearing,
a
formal
hearing
which
evidence
is
received.
and
this
court
has
specifically
so
held
in
the
american
trucking
case
in
344
u.s.
and
since
the
commission
does
not
required
to
hold
a
hearing
before
it
exercises
its
suspension
powers,
then
it
would
seem
that
section
8
(b)
is
finding
new
requirements
can't
possibly
apply
here.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
oh,
no.
what
happened
after
this
--
the
suspension
order
was
issued
on
september
23,
two
weeks
later
in
early
november,
the
railroads
filed
petitions
for
reconsideration.
those
petitions
for
reconsideration
were
served
upon
--
upon
the
motor
carrier
appellees
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
and
--
and
they
filed
their
replies.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
there
was
no
oral
argument
and
no
briefing
in
--
in
this
formal
sense.
there
was
petitions
for
the
railroads
for
reconsideration
and
written
replies
by
--
by
the
motor
carriers.
so,
everybody
concerned
knew
that
reconsideration
is
a
(inaudible).
third,
the
district
court
seem
to
view
the
statements
and
the
commission's
original
suspension
order
as
being
so
definitive
as
being
so
(inaudible)
that
it
couldn't
vacate
that
suspension
order
without
giving
in
details,
statement
and
reasons.
for
example,
that
--
referring
to
the
suspension
order
of
the
district
court
--
the
district
court
said
that
all
parties
were
entitled
to
take
this
for
its
face
value
as
a
deliberate
responsible
articulate
finding
that
the
proposed
rates
would
produce
these
illegal
results.
well,
of
course,
the
commission
didn't
make
any
such
finding.
he
said,
"on
consideration
of
the
documents
before
us,
there
is
reason
to
believe."
perhaps,
it
could
be
phrased
as
--
as
a
finding
of
probable
cause
on
--
on
the
basis
of
speedy
consideration.
and
note
that
division
2
had
one
day,
september
23,
on
which
to
decide
whether
to
suspend
the
rates.
and
that
one
day
and
as
addition
to
its
original
duty
--
an
addition
to
its
other
duties,
it
decides
to
suspend.
it's
on
the
basis
of
informal
written
presentation.
these
are
not
deliberate
findings
that
most
finding
of
probable
cause.
we
submit
that
this
--
that
the
rationale
of
the
district
court
overlooks
that
basic
character
of
the
whole
suspension
process.
and
turning
to
section
15
(7)
again,
that
requires
the
commission
when
it
suspends
rates
to
state
reasons
to
the
carrier
which
initiated
the
rates
and
whether
commission
refuses
to
suspend
rates,
it's
not
required
to
give
reasons
and
customarily,
it
does
not
do
so.
and
we
submit
that
there's
no
practical
difference
between
an
original
refusal
to
suspend
and
a
later
order
vacating
a
prior
suspension
order
because
the
net
result
is
always
the
same
that
upon
considering
the
available
information
and
other
limitations
of
time,
ought
means
that
the
commission
in
that
is
not
sufficiently
convinced
that
the
rates
are
unlawful
to
interfere
with
the
carrier
statutory
right
to
initiate
rates
subject
to
being
set
aside
after
a
hearing.
this
power
to
suspend
rates
is
a
drastic
administrative
power.
its
unwise
exercise
can
impose
heavy
loses
and
upon
either
the
initiating
carrier
or
a
competing
carrier
loses
which
they
can
in
no
way
recruit.
in
considering
the
speed
with
which
the
suspension
decisions
must
be
made
and
on
the
limited
informal
record,
a
record
untested
by
rebuttal,
we
urge
that
the
commission
should
be
encourage
to
reconsider
such
decisions.
and
that
such
reconsideration
on
the
basis
of
further
deliberation
should
not
be
discouraged
or
made
more
difficult
by
attaching
some
sort
of
conclusion
to
the
first
--
some
--
some
form
of
conclusiveness
to
the
initial
decision
which
in
this
case
had
to
be
made
within
one
day,
september
23rd.
and
we
contend
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
oh,
the
--
the
railroads
had
initiated
the
rates.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
they
came
piling
and
to
protest
the
suspension
order.
but
they
--
they
did
that
in
the
form
of
petition
and
for
reconsideration.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
we've
--
we've
had
one
case
also
followed
the
instant
case,
the
universal
car
loading
case
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
or
a
--
a
carrier
filed
the
complaint
seeking
review,
the
commission
order
suspending
the
rate.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
oh,
yes
about
2100
--
well,
about
2000
a
year.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
so
far
as
we
note,
this
is
the
first
such
case.
now,
i'd
like
to
call
attention
to
a
further
practical
danger
of
the
decision
below.
as
i
suggested,
these
suspension
actions
are
almost
intuitive
in
character.
they
are
made
rapidly
by
rate
experts
but
upon
incomplete
when
sometimes
incomplete
and
always
informal
records.
to
the
extent
that
under
the
decision
below,
the
commission
in
deciding
whether
to
suspend
or
not
to
suspend
or
whether
to
vacate
a
prior
suspension
order
is
required
to
make
detail
findings
and
various
elements
which
go
into
the
lawfulness
of
rates.
it
may
be
forced
into
unconscious
prejudgment,
officials
going
into
the
lawfulness
of
rates
which
i
think
everyone
would
agree,
it
should
finally
decide
only
after
a
hearing
in
which
evidence
is
received.
my
colleague,
mr.
mcdowell
can
take
the
rest
of
the
time.
