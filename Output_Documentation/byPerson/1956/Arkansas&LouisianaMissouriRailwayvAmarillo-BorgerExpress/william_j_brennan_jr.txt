justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know.
what
i
mean
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
my
question
was
this,
mr.
ginnane.
is
there
any
affirmative
finding
supporting
the
vacation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
all
there
is.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
they
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
weren't
argued
to
brief,
were
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
was
it
--
there
is
something
about
$1.53
rate
being
frozen
and
i
recalled
something
like
that
in
the
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
i
understand
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
but
do
i
correctly
understand
that
the
motor
carriers
must
charge
at
a
rate
not
less
then
$1.53
100
weight
whereas
the
new
rail
rates
are
$1.33?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
order
recites
petition's
requesting
vacation
in
reply
thereto.
what
was
the
substance
of
the
petitions?
that's
the
advance
to
this
order,
the
instant
date.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
did
the
replies
refer
reply
from
the
part
of
your
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
you
--
i
thought
you
said
that
you
received
no
notice
of
the
order
and
i
--
i
would
suppose
if
there
were
petitions
to
which
replies
were
filed
on
behalf
of
your
clients,
you
must
have
--
they
must
have
known
that
there
would
be
some
action
taken
on
the
petitions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
just
it
make
it
say
a
fair
inference
that
there
were
considerations
raised
by
those
petitions
answered
in
the
replies
which
finally
weighed
by
the
commission
led
them
to
vacate
their
order?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
what
you
would
have
wanted
the
order
to
say
or
something
in
fact
but
we
were
wrong
when
we
thought
that
somebody
was
going
to
be
hurt,
to
use
your
language.
and
that
now,
we're
satisfied
that
no
one
will
be
hurt
and
we're
satisfied
that
no
one
will
be
hurt
for
the
following
reasons,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
much
stronger?
wouldn't
that
have
been
enough?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
why
--
why
are
you
defending
this?
i
don't
follow
it.
i
mean,
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
what
does
it
make
to
your
clients
what
happens
to
those
seven
months.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
as
a
practical
matter,
if
the
appellants
win
here,
you
lose
nothing.
