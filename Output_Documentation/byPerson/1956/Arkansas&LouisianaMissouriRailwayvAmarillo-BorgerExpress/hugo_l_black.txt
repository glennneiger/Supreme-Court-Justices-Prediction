power
you

black
well,
subject
to
the

same
control
here
if

black
--
did
they
try
to
reduce
that
or
change
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
at
--
after
you
made
your
change,
did
they
try
to
change
that?
justice

black
did
this
commission
grant
them
the
right
to
change
--
justice

but
what
about

black
what
were
the
rate
relationships
during
that
period
of
time
due
to
the
two
orders
of
the
commission?
will
you
let
the
charge
more
or
less
--
justice

is
that
the
one
that
was
dissented?
justice

what

time?
justice

l.
black
what
were
the
barge
rates
at
that
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
trying
to
find
out
just
what's
the
cause
of
this
argument
here
in
relationship
with
the
rates
used
the
commission's
order?
did
you
get
an
advantage
or
the
other
side
gets
an
advantage?
what
does
it
claim?
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you
cut
down
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
you
--
would
that
leave
you
free
to
cut
under
him,
under
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
--
you
say
they
could
have
--
if
they
had
found
that
without
any
hearings
and
without
any
evidence,
without
any
additional
information,
that
would
be
enough?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
--
the
petitions
you
referred
to
are
not
here,
you
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
--
what
--
where
is
that
order
now?
was
that
challenged?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
--
is
that
the
order
you
say
that
after
investigation,
the
commission
decided
that
the
rates
were
fair?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
did
that
leave
the
comparative
rates
of
the
bus
lines
and
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
means
that
--
that
means
then
according
to
the
findings
i
presume
that
railroads
can
carry
cheaper
than
you
can
by
reason
of
the
inherent
advantages
that
they
have
over
you
in
that
connection?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
order
--
that
order
is
not
challenged
with
reference
to
the
rail
rates.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
much
difference
is
it
between
them?
what
was
the
difference
between
your
rates
at
the
time
that
the
commission
first
suspended
this
order?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what's
the
difference
now
after
all
these
hearings?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
saying
--
you
are
claiming
that
it
was
not
moot
when
you
filed
a
suit
but
it's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
but
has
become
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
--
you
are
saying
that
so
far
as
you
are
concerned
as
a
litigant,
so
far
as
the
admission
is
concerned
as
a
litigant,
no
longer
any
--
any
live
controversy
between
you
and
them
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
whatever
obligations
might
be
imposed
on
railroads
or
somebody
else.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
be
the
same
as
though
there
had
never
been
a
lawsuit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
parties
have
any
right
of
action
against
the
railroad
and
to
be
told
to
what's
been
done
already?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
relief
against
you
or
relief
against
somebody
else?
