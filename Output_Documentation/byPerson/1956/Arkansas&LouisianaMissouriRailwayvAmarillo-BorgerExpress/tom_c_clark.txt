what
about
the
reparations?
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
shippers
wouldn't
want
to
pay,
would
they?
justice
tom
c.
clark
now,
the
position
in
the
--
perhaps
i'm
wrong
that
the
commission
or
the
railroad
is
one,
provided
there
were
up
to
seven
weeks
period
between
the
date
and
the
issuance
of
this
vacation
is
commenced
and
the
issuance
of
the
injunction
by
the
court
in
which
the
railroad
is
charging
the
lower
rate.
justice
tom
c.
clark
presumably
it's
correct,
that's
legal,
it's
valid.
now,
they
should
have
been
charging
during
those
seven
weeks
the
higher
rate.
so
now,
they
would
be
obliged,
they
say,
(inaudible)
to
go
to
the
shippers
and
say,
“look,
we
charged
you
lower
rates.
we
should
have
charged
higher
and
we
have
to
charge
this
higher
rate.”
the
shippers
would
say,
“well,
look,
we've
paid
beyond
to
the
order
of
the
court.”
so,
there'd
be
a
controversy
between
the
railroad
and
the
shippers
as
to
whether
or
not
the
--
the
(voice

--
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
the
order
of
the
court
didn't
come
into
effect
until
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
january
(inaudible)
so,
during
the
seven
weeks,
they
were
collecting
the
lower
rate,
were
they
not?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
that's
to
say
what
the
railroads
were
saying,
“we
were
--
at
that
time,
depending
on
the
order
of
the
commission
and
we've
charged
them
the
lower
rate,
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
so,
they
--
the
shippers
would
come
in
and
say,
“well,
look,
the
court
vacated
that
ab
initio
so
you
don't
have
any
--
that's
not
a
valid
order,
but
you
have
a
conflict
according
to
the
railroad,
not
just
during
the
