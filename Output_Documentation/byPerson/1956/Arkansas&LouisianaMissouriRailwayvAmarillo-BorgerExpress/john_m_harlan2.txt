john

without
printing
in
anyway,
you
could
get
to
ask
this
question
now.
but
i
just
say
(inaudible)
in
the
briefs
and
i'm
hopeful
to
save
us
some
time
to
deal
with
the
questions
(inaudible)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
carry
that
to
the
point
of
saying
that
even
there
is
no
judicial
review
even
to
determine
whether
the
commission
has
been
procedurally
correct,
then
there's
no
power
to
review
the
merits
of
a
suspension
order?
is
the
court
also
prevented
from
deciding
whether
the
commission
has
complied
with
its
own
rules,
whatever
they
may
be
with
the
statute,
whatever
the
requirements
of
the
statutes
are?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
do.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
any
business
looking
into
this
business
--
looking
into
this
matter
at
all?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
as
far
as
these
two
parties
are
concerned,
what
is
certainly
academic,
this
is
an
action
by
one
of
the
parties,
some
step
--
one
of
these
parties
has
got
vague
against
the
third
party.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
so
far
as
the
party
is
involved
in
this
litigation
is
concerned,
what
seize
that
answer
is
the
moot
in
this
problem?
justice
john
m.
harlan
those
in
the
railroads
decide
they
don't
want
to
collect
them,
the
commission
compel
them?
justice
john
m.
harlan
to
rebate
to
take
in
pursuant
to
the
commission's
own
order?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
by
the
court
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
railroads
acted
under
it
and
has
it
had
to
act
under
it
so
long
as
it
--
it
stood
in
effect.
do
you
think
they
can
be
prosecuted
for
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
when
you
applied
to
the
original
order
of
suspension,
were
there
answers
by
the
railroads
to
that
or
was
that
ex
parte?
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
were
replies
thereto?
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
those
--
are
those
in
the
record?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
any
reason
why
they
can't
--
court
can't
have
access
to
those,
at
least
to
the
second
petition
and
replies
and
what's
all
the
mystery
about
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
argue
in
this
case
(voice
overlap)
unrealistic
bases,
it
seems
to
me,
it
would
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
there's
underlying
material
here
in
which
the
commission
acted
in
these
orders
as
recited,
why
isn't
it
in
the
record?
i
don't
understand
it.
