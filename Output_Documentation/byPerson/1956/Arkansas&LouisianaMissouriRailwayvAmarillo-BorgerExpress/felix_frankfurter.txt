lack
of?
justice
felix

yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
discovered
in
1920,
am
i
right
about
that?
justice

certainly,
not
mann-elkins.
justice
felix
frankfurter
meaning
by
that
and
i
don't
mean
to
interrupt
you
except
to
elucidate
if
i
can.
meaning
by
that,
the
commission
could
do
that
on
its
own
initiative
to
suspend
or
if
it's
moved
thereto?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
of
it.
all
of
the
suspension
brought
home,
not
only
to
the
carrier,
i
suppose
he
gets
a
while
to
the
shipping
public
and
the
region
of
the
tariff.
justice
felix

and
--
and
how
did
the
shippers
or
shippers
on
the
division
gets
notice
of
it?
is
there
any
formal
way
of
publication
or
anything?
justice

the

would
have

would
find
out.
justice

is
the

silent
on

is

a

in

well,
don't

don't
let
(inaudible).
justice

don't
answer
yet
(voice

--
justice

where
was
that
from
your
point
of
view
satisfied?
i'm
not
arguing,
but
where
was
that
document
which
gave
the
carrier
reasons?
justice

you
have
that
on
page
four?
justice
felix

and
what
is
the
specific
provision
of
the

justice

now,
did
the

you

you
didn't
make
findings?
justice

yes.
justice

yes,
but
it
did
find
--

--
findings
in
the

i
mean
if
you
find
anything.
justice

all
right.

we

that

not,

(inaudible)

(voice

--
justice

mr.
ginnane,
would
it
disturb
the
architecture
of
your
argument
if
you
told
us
--
if
you
summarize
what
the
judicial
situation
is
today,
the
mann-elkins
act
of
1910?
we're
now
in
1957,
that's
47
years,
and
it
comes
to
me
as
a
great
surprise
that
this
is
not
a
separate
question.
what
is
the
judicial
--
here
is
the
balance
sheet
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
judicial
situation
today.
on
this
question,
namely,
whether
it's
reviewable,
except
in
the
way
in
which
you
indicated
if
they
suspend
it
for
two
years
when
the
congress
says
90
days
because
they
get
suspended
for
two
years,
how
that
gives
you
anything.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
this
case
--
there
has
been
no
court,
if
i
follow
you,
has
entertained
a
bill
like
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
it
go
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
there
any
question
of
--
did
it
gone
that
it's
a
non-judicially
reviewable
or
that
at
the
state
it
isn't
at
the
particular
state
order
reviewable?
they
simply
said
this
is
a
suspension
filed
after
the
commission
and
you
have
to
wait
until
they
do
something
about
the
tariff
intrinsically,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
that
case?
do
you
know,
can
you
turn
it
for
us?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
was
it?
have
you
got
the
citation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
a
reason
that
i
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice

long

what's
the
name
of
the
long
island
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
find
it
in
your
brief,
do
i?
should
i?
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
were
the
judges?
do
you
know?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
think
he
decides
(inaudible)
i
don't
know
about
these
cases.
and
they
rested
on
this
case,
do
i
get
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
think
if
it's
not
reported,
perhaps,
you
will
have
copies
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you
very
much.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
the
standard
rate
that
an
increase
in
a
rate,
whether
it's
utility
rates
or
railroad
rate
or
ordinary
in
a
supreme
utility,
there
are
usually
ways
of
protecting
the
consumer.
if
you
suspend
an
increase
in
rate
here,
there's
no
way
of
protecting
their
carrier,
is
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
suspend
their
desire
for
an
increase,
the
reasonableness
of
which
may
just
relatively
justify
or
sustain
by
the
commission.
in
the
meantime,
they're
out
of
pocket
or
what
may
be
found
to
be
a
reasonable
rate,
isn't
that
the
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
know
why
you
say
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
suppose
it
suggested
that
they
have
exhausted
everything
here.
the
only
thing
to
--
the
only
thing
that's
left
is
the
disposition
of
the
merits
of
the
rate
of
the
proposed
tariff.
what
is
the
--
what
law
can
they
do
on
this
question
of
suspension
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
substantive
faith.
justice
felix
frankfurter
great.
well,
but
so
far
as
--
so
far
as
what
the
commission
has
done
best
far
or
the
--
the
impact,
the
consequence
of
suspending
a
rate,
they've
exhausted
all
there
is
on
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
that
--
in
that
process
and
nothing
left
for
that
to
do
except
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
await
a
determination
and
award
by
--
a
report
by
the
commission
on
the
merits.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
so.
but
i
--
i
don't
think
it
helps
many
to
say
they
must
exhaust
the
administrative
remedy.
they've
got
an
administrative
remedy
to
exhaust
on
this
action
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
--
you
come
indeed
--
probably
it
did
but
i
didn't
get
that.
the
--
when
did
this
litigation
begin
in
the
courts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
--
of
1950?
justice
felix
frankfurter
1955.
we're
now
in
--
in
march
1957.
the
disposition
of
the
merits
are
held
up,
aren't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
you
go
on
with
the
hearing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
is
that
on
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
were?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then,
that
--
i
should
think
that
brings
to
the
very
forefront
of
mr.
justice
harlan's
question.
what
are
we
deciding
here,
an
abstract
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
i
understand
we're
deciding
here
if
this
goes
one
way,
it
will
tell
the
commission
one
thing.
if
it
goes
beyond
that
and
so
far
as
this
litigation
is
concern,
is
that
question
alive?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
was
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
would
collect
what?
just
tell
me
that
again.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
railroad
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
is
the
commission
an
interest
in
that
litigation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
the
general
--
the
general
interest
in
seeing
that
proper
carriers
are
charged
and
faithful.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
rebate.
i
--
i
was
going
to
say
if
it
brings
proceedings
against
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
--
which
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
statute
--
can
you
tell
me
this
whether
the
statute
for
recovery
by
them
--
all
it
does,
actually,
as
to
what
time
would
that
run
and
the
time
that
--
that
you
fix
the
--
the
proper
rate?
in
other
words,
i
--
i
should
think
you're
quite
clear
speaking
for
myself
that
if
the
railroad
has
a
legal
cause
of
action
for
rates
collectible
within
two
years
when
they
fold
their
arms
and
waited
and
do
nothing,
that
would
be
a
clear
violation
of
the
elkins
act,
i
should
think.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
certainly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
mr.
ginnane,
how
were
the
parties
made
aware
of
the
vacation
of
the
original
suspension
order?
was
that
just
a
nice
and
taken
by
the
commission
of
which
they
were
given
some
notice
without
any
prior
information
that
it
was
contemplated?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
--
therefore,
the
test
is
with
the
--
with
the
suspension
order.
can
anybody
come
in
and
protest
the
suspension
order
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
this
--
is
there
in
the
record
here
--
and
they
didn't
go
to
the
court
to
have
--
as
there
been
any
--
as
there
been
instances
in
which
suspension
orders
by
the
commission
were
contested
in
the
proceedings
for
enjoinment
as
a
good
deal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
since
1910,
the
commission
must
have
been
suspending
thousands
upon
thousands
of
--
of
carriers.
and
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
evidently.
now,
has
the
power
to
suspend
on
findings
no
more
than
this
got
into
the
courts
at
all
during
that
hearing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
there's
another
way
of
dealing
with
the
matter,
mr.
mcdowell.
if
--
if
this
court
finds
--
i'm
not
saying
that
your
line
of
reasoning
as
modern
force
has
validity,
but
if
this
court
should
find
that
the
appeal
was
moot
--
rendered
moot
by
the
null
finding
of
the
commission,
it
would
then
--
if
it
vacated
that
--
what
the
law
--
the
district
court
did
wipe
it
off
the
books,
then
you
wouldn't
be
under
this
restriction
of
not
collecting
an
undercharge
--
an
improper
undercharge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wouldn't
adverse
the
effect.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
same
problem
of
whether
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
fact
--
a
fact
that
a
case
may
--
that
a
question
may
turn
up
here
again
is
not
a
good
reason
for
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
yet
if
the
question
isn't
properly
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
that's
--
that
bothers
counselor
(inaudible)
i'm
trying
to
find.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
a
typical
case
that
the
carriers
are
trying
to
meet
modal
competition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
barge
company
holds
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
any
--
anyhow,
there's
a
competition
of
a
rival
carrier
and
--
and
the
reduction
of
rate
under
the
--
under
the
1920
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
they
say.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
have
to
increase
them,
wouldn't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
long
did
that
suspension
lies
until
they
made
a
determination
on
validity
of
the
rates
would
be
down?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
your
rate.
i
mean
the
one
that
--
that
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
trying
to
see
--
that's
the
kind
of
a
time
spent
that
is
normal
in
this
situation,
isn't
mr.
mcdowell?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
that's
the
kind
of
a
normal
time
before
it
gets
around
to
determination
on
the
reasonableness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
it
go
through
the
board
of
suspension?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
just
--
they
just
channeled
it
over
the
--
to
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
they
--
supposed
they
have
concluded
that
the
board
of
suspension
were
right,
could
they
--
in
the
same
quick
manner
sustain
the
board
and
just
said
the
order
of
suspension
or
board
of
suspension
approve
--
or
board
of
suspension
approved
herein?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
they
said
nothing,
that
was
my
question,
would
they
have
to
say
anything?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
say
approved
on
a
piece
of
paper
that
came
up
to
it,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
those
findings,
why
they
didn't
suspend?
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
--
don't
follow
my
irrelevance.
you
stick
to
your
proper
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
do
it.
it's
relevant,
not
otherwise.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
this
--
this
--
from
your
point
of
view
slashing
ruthless
tariff,
proposed
tariff
by
the
--
filed
tariff
by
the
railroads
would
have
gone
into
effect
with
all
the
evil
consequences
that
you've
laid
before
us,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
assuming
the
contrary
hypothesis
that
the
board
of
suspension
rejected
your
protest
or
at
least
didn't
act
on
it
favorably,
acted
on
it
unfavorably
and
that
the
division
2
did
nothing
about
it.
then,
this
ruthless
tariff
would
have
gone
into
effect
unassailably,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
well,
i'm
not
--
i
just
want
to
know
what
the
course
of
events.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
the
board
--
what
the
underlying
--
what
the
structure
--
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
the
law,
what
the
interstate
commerce
act
provides,
what
the
procedure
for
relief
is,
what
the
power
of
the
commission
are.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
the
--
what
really
was
done
had
--
suppose
the
course
of
events
had
been
what
they
were,
namely
that
the
board
of
suspension
rejected
your
protest
or
didn't
act
on
it
favorably,
division
2,
in
fact,
overruled
the
board
and
suspend
it.
and
then,
suppose
division
2
did
what
i
have
known
courts
to
do,
think
of
all
what
they
have
done
and
get
together
the
next
day
and
say
“let's
reconsider
this”
someone,
a
member
more
interested
or
more
alert
or
more
anything
or
less
anything,
i
don't
care
which
and
say,
“let's
rethink
this.”
and
the
next
day
they
say
“we
were
all
wrong
about
it
yesterday,”
and
then
they
recall
that
order.
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
have
been
known
to
do
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
may
only
or
not
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that?
where
did
they
say
they
were
--
they
were
still
--
they
still
thought
it
ought
to
be
suspended
but
they
aren't
going
to
do
it?
where
did
they
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
any
kind
of
words.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon.
all
right.
thank
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
don't
they
have
to
examine
the
merits
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
order
that
was
filed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
didn't
you
protest
against
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know,
but
the
commission
don't
know
what
it
can
decide
whether
a
big
slash
in
the
rate
is
reasonable
or
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
there's
no
justification
for
any
such
statement.
they
merely
say
that
on
the
phase
of
it
is
a
basis
for
us
to
investigative.
it
doesn't
follow
because
you
investigate
to
find
a
rate
which
a
carrier
can
initiate
and
you
may
after
investigation
find
that
it's
unreasonable.
to
another
phase
of
it,
it's
unreasonable.
what's
the
point
of
a
long
investigation
if
you
can
make
that
judgment
very
quickly?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
that
reached
the
cycle?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
recital
baseless
where
the
commission
say
there
were
a
petition
and
replied
when
there
weren't
any?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
will
first
want
to
know,
was
there
a
petition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
their
reply?
justice
felix
frankfurter
an
order
replied
on
behalf
of
the
present
respondents?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
represent
the
respondents,
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
appellees,
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
appeal.
the
appellees,
were
those
replies
on
behalf
of
the
appellees?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
didn't
--
the
question
isn't,
if
i
may
so,
whether
you
saw
them.
the
question
is
whether
these
appellees
filed
a
reply?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
this
isn't
a
personal
matter,
mr.
currie.
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
about
two
months
--
two
months
elapsed
between
the
original
order
of
september
23rd
and
this
order
of
november
24th.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
november
14th
and
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
10
days
shorter
of
two
months.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
i
take
it,
justice
brennan
and
i
inquiring
about
is
what
took
place
in
between?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
commission
says
--
the
commission
says
that
a
petition
was
filed
and
that
replies
were
made
thereto.
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
could
be
sorry
days
so
far
as
i'm
concerned
if
the
commission
would
make
recitals
like
that
or
unfounded
in
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
it
make
a
difference
to
your
case
if
they
had
said
in
explicit
unambiguous
language
having
on
reconsideration
and
found
that
probably
cause
does
not
exist
for
suspension
but
no
more.
would
that
have
made
a
difference
to
your
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
they
said
that,
we
were
in
error
in
finding
these
rates,
would
that
have
satisfied
--
would
that
make
a
difference
to
your
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
those
words
and
no
more?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
that
isn't
the
order
--
i'm
just
--
i'm
thinking
if
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
had
been
the
order.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
no
more.
no
more
hearings,
nothing
more
except
putting
in,
we
now
realized
we
were
all
inclined
in
probable
cause
and
we'll
wait
until
the
full
investigation
exposes
the
whole
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
means
in
this
case
that
they
could
say
nunc
pro
tunc,
we
now
insert
and
whereas,
as
then
so
minded,
we
do
not
find
the
base
--
probable
cause
for
suspending.
we
as
of
whatever
this
date
is,
december
25th,
december
14th
has
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
whatever
it
is,
way
back.
that's
what
this
--
that's
what
the
practicality
would
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
--
your
statement
doesn't
--
didn't
call
for
any
factual
statement.
it
merely
requires
a
recital,
an
explicit
language
that
we
have
--
we
now
find
way
back,
not
after
the
whole
investigation.
we
find
as
of
whatever
it
was,
december,
1954
that
there
was
no
probably
cause.
that's
all
they
would
have
to
say
to
be
according
to
a
lawyer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
a
--
a
tribunal
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
a
--
if
a
tribunal
changes
its
--
reverses
its
opinion,
it
means
it's
of
the
same
opinion
still,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yet,
you're
asking
us
to
say
that
the
commission
was
baseless
in
making
such
a
determination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
court
has
never
made
any
such
statement
because
it
couldn't.
it
must
have
made
it
with
reference
to
a
particular
agency,
with
reference
to
particular
proceeding
on
a
particular
record.
it
doesn't
make
and
i
don't
believe
it
ever
has
said
in
this
blanket
way
because
if
there's
one
thing
that's
to
be
said
about
the
relation
of
the
courts
to
the
--
to
the
administrative
agency
that
these
are
rowdily
speaking
ad
hoc
situations.
the
idea
of
saying
that
this
--
that
this
court
has
ever
pronounced
that
it
can
never
led
an
administrative
order
by
unless
as
we
know
what
all
the
facts
were,
particularly
when
the
facts
aren't
broad
here
for
us
to
determine
whether
the
administrative
agency
acted
with
the
utmost
reason.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
not
so,
in
the
(inaudible)
cases
which
ought
not
to
be
unknown
to
you,
this
court
held
the
commission
could
act
without
anything
before
it,
anything
and
give
no
reason.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
only
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understood
from
what
you
said
a
minute
ago,
you're
here
out
of
regards
for
your
duty
to
the
court
as
a
lawyer
and
yet
you
argue
the
case
is
moot
so
it's
our
business
to
throw
out
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
you
argue
the
case
is
moot.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
--
so
that
your
duty
as
a
counsel
to
this
court
is
to
bring
a
case
here
that
you
say
we
should
throw
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know,
but
the
case
is
--
the
case
is
now
decided
so
that
you
created
a
situation
--
we've
got
a
situation
in
which
a
principle
of
law
is
laid
down,
which
you
now
say
is
moot,
the
decision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
must
have
had
a
live
litigation,
some
interest
of
a
client
and
not
merely
abstract
devotion
to
law
that
brought
you
in
the
court,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
can't.
lawyers
can,
no
matter
how
strongly
they
feel,
that
they
want
a
further
sound
law.
they
cannot
just
come
into
a
court
and
say,
"i
want
to
promote
the
just
development
of
the
law."
their
client
must
have
an
earthly
interest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
higher
rate
is
now
the
legal
rate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean,
the
charge
--
they
charged
too
little
and
what
is
the
law
--
what
was
found
to
be
the
lawful
rate,
is
that
right?and
therefore,
there
was
an
undercharge
and
therefore
if
the
railroad
doesn't
collect
it,
it's
a
rebate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
something
alive.
that's
what
--
as
i
had
to
consider
here
for
many
years,
that's
what
most
of
these
rails
are
about,
money
on
one
side
or
another.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
can't
be
that
there's
a
real
controversy
if
they
go
before
the
commission,
but
there
is
no
controversy
here.
if
you
say
they
could
get
this
fixed
up
or
somehow
arranged
by
getting
proper
relief
before
the
commission,
it
must
be
something
with
reference
to
which
relief
is
given.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
says
something
--
which
relief
is
to
be
given
then
it's
a
live
controversy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
of
mootness
doesn't
mean
that
both
of
them
--
we
got
the
railroads
here.
they've
got
an
interest,
but
you
say
it's
a
lie.
they
can
get
it
arranged
and
taken
care
of
by
going
to
the
commission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
affected
by
what
happens
here?
