well,
couldn't
the
jury
at
least
--
a
reasonable
man
differ
on
what
he
meant
by
--
when
--
when
he
said
bury
them
--
justice

--
that
a
reasonable
man
differ
whether
he
meant
bury
them
in
the
right-of-way
or
somewhere
else?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
even
--
even
with
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
it
would
be
unreasonable
for
a
juror
to
infer
from
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
there
again
might
reasonable
men
not
differ
though
from
the
fact
that
this
concession
that
they
were
not
screened,
whether
or
not
the
steps
taken
to
prevent
the
oversized
clinkers
getting
into
the
roadbed
are
adequate
for
the
purpose?
