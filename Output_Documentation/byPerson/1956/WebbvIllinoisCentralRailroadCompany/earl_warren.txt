john
w.
webb
versus
(inaudible).
mr.
rafferty
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
deany.
chief
justice
earl
warren
will
you
excuse
me
just
a
moment?
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
didn't
quite
get
your
point
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
question
was,
“well,
now,
in
any
particular
--
is
any
particular
use
made
of
larger
cinders
if
any
are
found?”
answer
“we
never
use
them
if
we
can
avoid
it
of
course.
the
larger
cinders
we
take
and
either
bury
them
or
haul
them
away
and
dumped
them
in
a
hole
some
place
and
dispose
of
them
that
way.”
now,
just
what
did
you
say
that
language
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
meant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
clinker
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
pardon
me.
but
the
clinker
the
size
of
your
fist
be
concealed
in
a
full
--
full
shovel
full
of
clinkers?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
believed
that
if
he
saw
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
would
--
that
just
bore
on
whether
--
whether
the
jury
would
have
the
right
to
determine
even
though
they
did
see,
even
though
this
man
did
inspect
every
--
every
shovel
full
that
there
might
have
been
one
in
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
deany,
it
shows
that
it
was
not
screened,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
record
show
that
it
was
not
screened?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
thought
you
will
answer
to
justice
reed
that
it
didn't
show
that
it
was
screened.
but
on
the
contrary,
it
shows
it
was
not
screened,
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
do
you
do
with
the
case
of
lavender
versus
kurn,
mr.
deany?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
true.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
am
reading
from
--
from
counsel's
brief
in
which
he
--
he
says
this
about
the
lavender
case.
the
plaintiff's
decedent
was
killed
in
an
unwitnessed
accident.
her
theory
was
that
the
decedent
was
killed
when
struck
on
the
head
by
a
mail
hook
projecting
from
a
backing
train.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
defendants
contended
that
he
had
been
murdered.
strangers
precluded
the
premises.
the
mail
hook
showed
no
evidence
of
contact
with
a
human
body
and
there
was
evidence
to
show
that
it
was
physically
and
mathematically
impossible
for
the
hook
to
strike
the
decedent,
yet,
they
let
--
let
the
case
go
to
the
jury
on
those
facts.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
those
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
finish
that
if
you
have
a
minute
or
so.
you
might
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
don't
think
i've
raised
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
all
of
your
points,
but
you
may
finish
--
you
may
finish
that
one,
mr.
--
mr.
deany
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
you
wish
to
make
a
moment
to
do
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
much
difference
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
between
two
inches
in
diameter
and
two
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
