why?
did
he
say
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
say
he
saw
every
clinker?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
didn't
say
he
saw
every
clinker,
did
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
evidence
that
he
fell
over
a
clinker?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
understand
your
evidence
shows
that
one
that's
not
big
enough
to
be
dangerous
wouldn't
be
dangerous
to
a
man
so
he
wouldn't
fall
over
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
there's
evidence
that
he
fell
over
a
clinker
and
they
don't
fall
over
them,
don't
fall
over
them,
if
--
that's
normal
and
that
would
be
evidence
that
they
were
not
that
small,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
be
an
inference,
wouldn't
it,
if
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
say
there
was
evidence
that
he
fell
over
a
clinker.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
if
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
there's
also
evidence
that
a
man
is
not
likely
to
fall
over
a
clinker
that's
small.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
your
--
that's
your
defense,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
one
of
your
defense
is
this
that
they
were
so
small,
they
were
not
dangerous,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
dangerous
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you
mean?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
not
dangerous?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
mean
--
you
mean
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
dangerous?
what's
the
evidence
on
that?
if
it's
less
than
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
--
whether
that
would
be
one
less
than
two
inches,
is
there
evidence
that
it's
dangerous
or
not
dangerous?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then,
there
is
no
evidence
whether
it's
dangerous
or
not
dangerous.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
where
does
the
--
where
does
the
cinders
on
the
railroad
track
usually
come
from?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
do
they
usually
come
from?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
evidence
here
that
--
there
was
a
stranger
came
up
there
with
a
pocket
full
of
clinkers
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
or
seen
around
there
before
this
happened?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
evidence
of
any
kind
that
would
refute
the
idea
that
this
clinker
got
on
there
the
usual
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
show
that
each
way,
the
particular
clinker
came
from
on
a
railroad
track?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
i
--
i
suppose
as
a
general
rule
of
law
that
when
you
saw
something
happens
nearly
all
the
time
on
one
particular
circumstance
and
you
show
that
the
things
there
and
it
nearly
always
comes
from
the
particular
thing
and
the
jury
for
the
reason
it
defined
that
it
came
from
that
thing,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
decision?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
recall
it,
i
--
i
may
be
wrong,
but
as
i
recall
it,
defense
was
that
there
a
lot
of
bad
people
around
close
to
that
railroad.
justice
hugo
l.
black
someone
might
have
slipped
in
there
and
killed
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
some
claimed,
he
might
have
hit
him
on
the
back
of
the
head
and
the
court
below
held,
as
i
recall
it,
that
you
couldn't
speculate
on
whether
he
was
a
stranger
came
in
and
killed
him
or
whether
he
hit
him.
his
head
was
hit
on
by
this
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
this
court
said
a
reasonable
amount
of
speculation
was
sometimes
absolutely
essential
and
all
the
transactions
are
right,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
no
inference
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
no
inference
when
a
man
who's
walking
along
the
railroad
track
whether
the
evidence
assuming
that
that
he
has
tripped
over
at
something
and
he's
admitted
that
cinders
of
certain
size
on
a
railroad
track
are
dangerous
and
it's
also
has
to
be
admitted,
i
assume,
that
nearly
all
of
the
cinders
that
ever
get
on
the
railroad
track
comes
from
the
railroad.
you
say
that
no
reasonable
man
could
draw
an
inference
that
(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
have
to
say
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
don't
you
have
to
say
that
to
say
there
was
not
a
case
for
the
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
must
present
evidence,
must
he
not,
from
which
reasonable
fair-minded
men
could
draw
the
inference
that
it
happened
in
a
way
he
claimed?
