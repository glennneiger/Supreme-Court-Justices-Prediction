mr.
herbert
j.
deany
may
it
please
the
court
and
mr.
rafferty.
i
would
like
to
mention
briefly
several
items
that
counsel
had
just
mentioned
first.
he
says
that
the
foreman
--
section
foreman,
mr.
rector
testified
that
when
he
found
rocks
or
stones,
two
inches
in
diameter,
that
--
that
they
made
efforts
to
exclude
those
stones.
i
submit
that
that
is
not
the
record
in
this
case.
the
testimony
in
that
behalf
appears
at
page
73
of
the
record
and
starting
there
at
page
140
of
the
record
there
and
page
73.
the
question
“now,
to
the
best
of
your
ability,
can
you
indicate
about
the
size
of
the
cinders
and
the
ballast
that
was
cropped
in?”
answer
“the
cinders
were
pretty
clean
along
with
this
chat
that
we
gathered
up.
i
would
say
two
inches
in
diameter
would
be
about
the
largest.
of
course,
i
have
no
way
of
knowing
exactly
what
about.”
now,
here's
the
question
that
counsel
has
misstated.
question
“well,
now,
is
any
particularly
use
made
of
larger
cinders
if
any
are
found?”
answer
“we
never
use
them
if
we
can
avoid
it.
of
course,
the
larger
cinders
we
take
and
either
bury
them
or
haul
them
away
and
dump
them
in
a
hole
somewhere
and
dispose
of
them
that
way.”
in
other
words,
that
language
there
shows
that
a
rock
or
a
stone,
two
inches
in
diameter,
is
not
too
large
for
the
customary
use
in
railroad
railway.
now
--
next,
he
refers
to
the
schulz
case,
250
u.s.
526,
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
all
right,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
i
say,
your
honor
--
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
pardon
me.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
mr.
chief
justice,
i
say
that
he
testified
here
that
two
inches
in
diameter
would
be
about
the
largest
that
they
would
use
customarily.
then
the
question
is
this.
now
--
well,
now,
in
any
--
is
any
particular
use
made
of
larger
cinders
if
they
are
found?that
means
larger
than
the
two
inches
in
diameter.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
and
incidentally,
a
cinder
about
the
size
of
a
normal
man's
fist
is
considerably
larger
than
two
inches
in
diameter.
two
inches
in
diameter
multiplied
by
pi
and
you've
got
about
six
inches
for
fraction
holders.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
i
would
say
not,
mr.
justice.
i
would
say
it
does
not
lead
to
that
fact.
this
is
just
a
question
as
to
what
they
would
do
if
there
were
larger
cinders
that
he
found
there
when
he
was
removing
his
ballast.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
he
said
he
buried,
that's
correct,
buried
it
or
in
other
way,
this
--
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
either
way,
dispose
of
them.
no,
he
did
not
say
it.
he
said
--
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
--
that
he
would
not
use
them
in
the
right-of-way.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
well,
then,
it
was
the
next
question
then,
if
you
please,
mr.
justice
clark.
question:
“are
the
larger
cinders
ever
used
in
raising
track?”
answer:
“no,
sir.”
is
that
--
is
that
to
your
satisfaction?
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
oh,
no,
no.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
no,
he
says
that
--
he
said
he
makes
a
hole
and
puts
them
in
there,
a
hole
in
some
place
or
hauls
them
away.
but
then
he
goes
on
to
say
that
he
never
uses
them.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
well,
for
the
very
simple
reason,
it
might
make
an
unsafe
right-of-way
if
it's
larger
than
that.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
i
would
--
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
i
would
think
not,
your
honor,
but
in
particular,
would
that
be
true,
your
honor,
where
he
goes
on
to
say,
"are
the
largest
cinders
ever
used
in
raising
the
track,"
this
job
was
a
track
raising
operation.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
yes.
and
he
says
positively
and
categorically
that
they
are
never
used
in
raising
the
track.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
i
certainly
do
but
i
don't
know
anything
if
it'd
be
unreasonable,
your
honor,
but
i
think
it
would
be
absolutely
contrary
to
the
affirmative
evidence
in
the
record.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
there
is
one
question
there
that
he
does
say
that
that
--
those
cinders
and
that
chat
was
picked
up
on
the
passing
track
which
is
north
of
the
switch
leading
to
--
from
the
main
line
to
the
house
track.
it
was
extra
ballast
and
mr.
rector
testified
that
that
chat
was
in
good
condition.
and
while
we're
on
that,
we
may
go
to
page
77
of
the
record
and
i
like
to
call
your
attention
on
what
the
evidence
there
is
and
this
is
during
the
cross-examination
of
mr.
rector.
and
at
page
77
right
above
the
--
the
page
--
record
page
147.
question
“i
understand
you
inspected
this
ballast.”
answer
“yes,
we
load
it
by
hand
on
the
pushcarts
and
in
that
way
we
would
watch
the
loading
of
it.
i
did
watch
the
loading
of
it.”
question
“were
you
watching
these
four
different
man
load
shovel
by
shovel?”
answer
“sure.
it
was
right
there.
they
were
loading
from
both
sides
and
i
saw
every
shovel
full.”
question
“and
you
never
saw
large
cinders
in
that
mixture
at
all?”
and
the
answer
is,
"no,
sir."
now,
there
is
positive
testimony
that
this
ballast
was
in
good
condition.
now,
going
down
further
or
you
get
to
the
question
that's
screened.
it's
on
the
same
page.
the
question
there
is,
"i
asked
you
whether
this
ballast
was
screened."
he
says,
"screened,
screen?
no,
sir,
i
did
not
get
the
question."
so
he
does
say
it
wasn't
screened.
but
that
doesn't
mean
anything
if
his
testimony
is
positive
and
it's
uncontradicted
that
the
ballast
was
in
good
condition,
then
we
got
affirmative
proof
here
that
it
was
in
good
condition.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
he
said
he
saw
every
shovel
full,
mr.
justice
black.[laughter]
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
no,
that
would
be
quite
a
job
there,
your
honor,
[laughter]
to
see
every
clinker
in
the
rail
of
right-of-way
because
there
are
millions
and
millions
and
oceans
of
clinkers
in
the
railroad
of
right-of-way.
there
are
cinders
right
and
not
necessary
clinkers.
however,
i
would
say
that
one
oversized
clinker
would
come
a
long
ways
from
establishing
negligence
or
the
lack
of
exercise
of
ordinary
care
in
then
getting
a
railroad
right-of-way.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
reasonable
men
might
if
there
were
some
basis
for
it
or
if
--
if
the
evidence
was
not
such
as
to
overcome
that
possibility.
and
here,
we
maintain
that
the
evidence
does
overcome
that
possibility.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
the
evidence
of
the
plaintiff
is
that
he
fell
over
a
clinker.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
well,
which
would
indicate
that
the
clinker
probably
wasn't
the
size
of
the
man's
fist,
your
honor.
and
there's
plenty
of
reason
--
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
that
would
be
not
necessarily.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
not
necessary.
i
--
it
--
it
might
--
i
don't
think
it's
an
inference
here
because
you're
--
you're
going
too
far.
you're
speculating
too
much
here.
you've
not
only
got
to
--
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
well,
that's
what
he
testified
to,
your
honor
--
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
--
and
we
got
to
admit
that.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
the
evidence
--
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
no,
it
isn't,
not
by
any
means.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
well,
the
testimony
and
that's
the
standard
of
railroading.
the
testimony
is
that
a
rock
or
a
stone
to
--
up
to
two
inches
in
diameter
is
in
accordance
with
railroad
standards
acceptable
for
use
in
railroad
right-of-way.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
and
--
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
pardon
me?
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
i
mean
that
it's
acceptable
according
to
the
custom
--
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
--
and
the
standard.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
there
isn't
any
evidence
that
two-inch
in
diameter
rock
is
dangerous.
there
is
--
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
--
evidence
here
that
a
rock,
the
size
of
a
man's
fist,
might
be
dangerous.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
the
evidence
is
that
according
to
the
standard
of
maintenance
of
track
railroad,
they
use
it
and
use
it
in
accordance
with
the
standard
practice
of
railroad.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
no,
not
--
not
in
that
pretty
terms,
your
honor,
i
would
say.
now
--
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
that's
right.
that's
what
--
that's
what
the
record
shows.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
a
--
the
record
shows
that
he
looked
at
the
screening
before
he
picked
it
up
and
that
the
screenings
were
in
good
condition
and
a
record
further
shows
that
he
examined
every
shovel
full
of
the
ballast
whether
it
was
being
loaded
on
the
pushcart.
i
would
say
that's
rather
strong
evidence
that
there
wasn't
any
clinker
in
this
ballast
at
that
time.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
well,
it
might
be.
i
would
say
i
don't
--
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
i
wouldn't
think
of
that.
i
wouldn't
think
it
would
be
very
likely
too,
your
honor,
but
at
the
same
time,
i
couldn't
say
it
would
be
impossible.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
well,
down
to
that.
it
is
the
position
of
this
defendant
that
this
is
nothing
but
--
fundamentally
nothing
but
an
ordinary
negligence,
common
law
negligence
action.
it's
true
that
this
action
is
brought
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
but
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
while
it
does
modify
in
some
respects
the
theory
of
negligence
action,
it
does
not
modify
in
any
respect
the
concept
of
common
law
negligence,
except
--
so
far
it
is
modified
by
the
prohibition
against
assumption
of
risk
and
substituting
compared
of
negligence
for
cause
instead
of
--
instead
of
contributory
negligence
being
a
complete
defense.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
the
record
does
not
shows
--
does
not
show
that
it
was
screened
at
this
particular
movement.
that
ballast,
your
honor,
was
moved
in
sometime
before
that
when
they
are
raising
the
track,
the
passing
track
and
that
was
surplus
ballast
that
is
up
there
in
the
passing
track
and
it
is
picked
up
there,
15
yards
of
it,
because
it
was
surplus
and
at
that
time
it
was
in
good
condition
and
it's
moved
on.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
the
answer
to
that
is
--
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
the
answer
to
the
question
at
that
time,
it
was
not
screened
at
that
time.
the
record
show
--
so
shows.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
it
does
not
show
that
either
way,
your
honor.
now,
if
the
--
this
be
the
law
that
there
is
no
change
in
common
law
negligence
made
by
the
federal
employees'
liability
act.
then
in
order
for
them
to
make
a
prima
facie
case
here
of
negligence
on
a
situation
of
this
character,
they
must
show
at
least
three
things.
first,
they
must
show
that
--
well,
at
least
one
of
three
things
i
should
say,
it
must
show
that
this
foreign
object,
and
that's
what
it
would
be,
was
placed
in
the
ballast
by
the
defendant
at
the
time
of
his
work.
or
they
must
show
that
this
foreign
object
was
in
the
ballast
and
that
they
had
knowledge
or
were
charged
with
knowledge
of
its
actual
presence
in
the
ballast.
or
in
the
third
--
the
third
thing
of
element
is
they
must
show
by
evidence
that
the
standard,
the
customary
standard
of
railroad
practice
which
is
the
practice
that
governs
an
ordinary
care
was
violated
in
this
case.
now,
we
submit
that
there
isn't
an
iota
of
proof
on
anyone
of
those
three
things.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
well,
they
--
they
might
come
from
--
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
usually
they
are
place
there
in
a
--
in
a
roadbed
by
the
railroad
--
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
no,
there
is
--
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
no,
there
is
not,
your
honor.
(inaudible)
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
the
usual
way?
no,
there
is
not.
there
is
not.
and
that's
our
point
that
the
burden
is
on
them
to
show
that.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
have
it
work
both
ways,
mr.
justice
black.
you
got
to
show
--
the
plaintiff
must
show
it
and
i
suppose,
it's
according
to
the
theory
that
you
infer.
again,
the
railroad
would
have
to
show
where
each
clinker
comes
and
after
all
--
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
well,
i
don't
think
that
is
the
--
in
line
with
the
decisions
of
this
court,
the
previous
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
well,
the
patton
here.
for
instance,
the
patton
case
in
179
u.s.
that
it
wasn't
a
cinder
case
of
course
but
it
was
a
case
of
a
fireman
whose
duty
it
was
at
the
end
of
his
run
to
clean
the
side
of
his
locomotive.
he
went
over
to
the
roundhouse
where
it
was
loaded
--
located.
and
going
down
from
the
engine,
the
step
gave
away
and
he
fell
to
the
ground.
now,
that
today,
of
course,
that
would
be
--
violates
the
safety
appliance
act
and
the
mere
fact
that
that
condition
existed
would
establish
negligence
as
a
matter
of
law.
but
the
safety
appliance
act
didn't
involve
here
and
the
language
of
that
section
for
that
case
is
very
much
in
point
on
this
question
of
negligence.
there,
they
indicate
that
this
step
had
been
inspected
at
various
times
in
route
so
far
as
any
of
the
employees
of
the
railroad
know.
there
was
nothing
wrong
there.
there
was
testimony
by
one
railroad
official
who
said
that
it
would
be
possible
for
not
to
work
loose
when
--
when
a
locomotive
was
traversing
a
large
area
and
that
it
might
work
loose
and
come
to
him,
how
did
he
notice?
however,
the
evidence
was
that
it
did
come
loose
and
the
man
did
fall
and
you've
got
the
same
situation
there
that
you
got
here.
you
got
evidence
here
that
there
was
a
rock
there
and
this
man
did
fall.
but
you
haven't
got
--
they
didn't
have
any
evidence
there
that
this
condition
had
existed
for
even
a
minute
before
this
man
stepped
on
it.
and
the
court
told
--
this
court
held
that
in
the
absence
of
a
showing,
positive
evidence,
affirmative
evidence,
that
this
condition
was
known
to
the
railroad,
caused
by
the
railroad
or
that
it
existed
for
such
a
time
as
to
charge
him
with
the
notice,
there
could
be
no
liability.
and
that
is
the
situation
you
got
here
exactly.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
lavender
versus
kurn,
that's
one
of
the
cases
he
relies
upon.
in
lavender
versus
kurn,
this
court
held
that
there
was
sufficient
probative
facts
to
submit
a
question
of
fact
to
a
jury
here.
and
that
--
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
--
that
--
that
is
true
too,
your
honor.
you
may
recall
that
there
was
a
big
mound
of
dirt
and
cinders
on
either
side
of
that
switch
and
there
was
also
a
car
that
went
around
the
bin
there
and
had
a
mail
arm
hanging
--
suspending
from
the
side,
its
arched
back
and
forth.
it
went
around
and
--
while
it
should
have
been
in
the
clear
pointed
a
presence
of
this
mound
of
dirt
that
elevated
this
man's
head
so
that
--
the
--
there
was
sufficient
evidence
there
to
show.
now,
that
was
the
condition
that
was
created
by
the
railroads
and
was
known
by
the
railroads
to
be
there
and
that
is
not
that
there's
no
proof
here
that
this
condition
was
created
by
the
railroad.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
yes,
but
--
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
i
think,
your
honor
--
i
know
your
honor
is
very
busy
but
i'd
--
i'd
like
to
have
your
honor
read
that
case
if
you
can
because
you'll
find,
when
you
do,
that
the
evident
--
that
mathematical
equation
there
was
not
exactly
right.
you'll
find
that
--
it
refers
to
mound
of
dirt
and
cinders
on
either
side
of
that
switch
which
rose
from
18
to
24
feet
above
the
top
of
the
railroad.
the
rails
are
about
seven
inches
from
the
ground
that
over
hanging
mail
arm
was
73
and
one
quarter,
one-half
inches
above
the
rail.
this
man
was
67
and
a
half
inches
tall
and
he
happened
to
be
on
one
of
those
mounds
which
he
could
have
been.
that
mail
hook
would
have
struck
him
exactly
where
the
evidence
indicated
that
it
did
strike
it.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
that's
correct.
that
was
in
there
too.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
the
court
--
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
and
there
was
sufficient
probative
facts
in
there,
your
honor,
and
properly
sought,
afford
an
inference
there,
but
that
--
there's
no
inferences
warranted
here
by
the
evidence
in
this
case.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
this
court
--
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
no,
i
didn't
say
that,
your
honor.
i'm
--
i'm
sorry
--
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that.
i
might
have
--
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
i
--
i
might
have
been
advertently.
i
did
not
mean
to
say
that.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
no,
i
don't
your
honor.
i
--
i
say
this
that
this
is
a
negligent
case
and
that
the
law
--
this
man
is
not
an
--
the
railroad
is
not
an
insurer
of
this
man's
safety
or
of
a
safe
place
to
work.
i
say
that
the
law
in
this
case
is
that
a
plaintiff
to
maintain
his
action
must
prove
the
elements
that
are
incident
to
a
common
law
negligent
action.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
yes,
he
must
--
to
present
evidence
on
all
of
the
issues
that
existed
and
were
necessary
at
common
law
except
as
to
such
modifications
as
are
made
in
the
common
law
negligence
by
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
now
--
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
the
standards
--
their
testimony
here
shows
that
standards
up
to
two
inches
in
diameter
are
proper.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
no,
no,
it
does
not,
your
honor.
that's
the
practice
of
this
railroad
and
that's
the
only
evidence
in
this
case.
you
see,
our
trouble
here
is
that
--
mr.
justice
reed,
is
that
they're
taken
the
position
here
that
the
mere
fact
that
an
accident
happens
and
somebody
died
or
is
injured
establishes
a
case
and
that
isn't
true
under
the
federal
employees'
liability
act.
this
court,
the
only
charge
in
this
case
is
section
--
subsection
(6)
(a)
which
alleges
that
it
was
the
duty
of
the
defendant,
whether
the
defendant
violated
its
duty
and
that
it
fail
to
furnish
the
plaintiff
with
a
--
fail
to
use
extraordinary
care
to
furnish
the
plaintiff
when
their
reason
--
every
safe
place
to
work
and
to
perform
the
duties
of
his
employment.
that
was
denied.
that's
the
only
charge
in
here.
now,
you
got
a
further
instruction
in
this
case.
it's
--
instruction
number
one,
it
appears
in
page
97
of
the
record.
that
instruction
said
that
the
burden
is
not
upon
the
defendant
to
show
that
he's
not
guilty
of
negligence
charge
but
that
the
burden
is
on
the
plaintiff
to
prove
as
the
negligence
--
the
charge
of
negligence
and
that
he
must
do
so
by
the
greater
weight
or
requirements
of
the
evidence.
that
instruction
wasn't
questioned
as
it
finally
was
given.
now,
we've
got
the
point
here.
when
plaintiff
started
this
case,
he
had
four
charges
of
negligence
in
this
case.
one
was
failed
to
furnish
--
to
exercise
ordinary
care
to
furnish
the
plaintiff
with
a
reason
to
safe
place
to
work.
and
by
the
way
that's
the
criterion
that
this
court
uses
in
all
of
these
cases.
two,
that
the
defendant
negligently
placed
an
oversized
rock
in
its
ballast
at
the
time
of
these
improvements.
three
that
the
defendant
negligently
inspected
the
equipment
so
that
this
rock
was
left
in
there,
and
four
that
the
defendant
violated
its
own
rules
and
regulations.
now,
to
close
up
all
the
evidence,
the
plaintiff
voluntarily
withdrew
every
one
of
these
charges
except
the
one.
in
other
words,
the
one
that
he
rely
so
strongly
here,
namely,
that
the
railroad
company
negligently
placed
a
rock
in
this
ballast
was
voluntarily
withdrawn
by
him
and
that
appears
to
close
the
plaintiff's
case
in
this
record.
now,
what
his
reason
for
withdrawing
that
is
now
coming
in
and
trying
to
rely
on
it
is
something
that
i
cannot
fathom
personally.
but
the
only
reason
that
they
usually
withdraw
is
because
they
fail
to
make
a
prima
facie
showing
such
as
the
negligence
law
requires
and
that's
what
happened
in
this
case.
his
evidence
and
it
must
be
affirmative
evidence
did
not
show
what
he
charged
and
because
of
that
he
voluntarily
withdraw
it
and
relied
upon
the
--
paragraph
(6)
(a)
of
the
complaint
which
alleged
that
it
was
--
that
the
defendant
violated
it's
duty
to
exercise
ordinary
care
to
keep
the
premises
safe
where
is
the
safe
place
to
work
for
the
plaintiff.
now,
there
is
also
a
question
here
as
to
whether
or
not
this
rock
was
a
size
of
a
man's
fist
or
whether
as
he
said
it
was
six
inches
in
diameter
or
circumference
rather.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
well,
i
have
several
points,
your
honor.
i
--
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
[laughs]
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
all
right.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
yes.
at
the
time,
he
testified
on
the
road
care.
he
said,
and
the
record
showed
at
page
14,
he
was
asked
what
the
size
of
this
rock
was
and
he
says,
“i
would
--
it
was
about
the
size
of
a
man's
fist,
i
guess.”
now,
any
statement
previously
taken
and
which
was
admitted
by
agreement
and
withdraw
which
was
unsworn
to
do
it
at
the
time,
he
said
that
he
stumbled
over
a
rock
that
was
two
inches
in
diameter.
now,
two
inches
in
diameter,
multiplied
by
three
and
one
(inaudible)
is
considerably
less
than
the
circumference
of
a
man's
fist.
the
evidence
further
shows
here
that
he
fully
understood
and
appreciated
what
is
meant
by
the
circumference
instead
of
the
diameter
because
on
cross-examination,
at
the
request
of
the
--
the
railroad
counsel,
he
took
a
tape
measure
and
made
a
loop
showing
six
inches
in
circumference
and
is
--
there
--
any
question
in
the
world
about
what
he
knew
the
difference
between
six
inches
in
circumference
and
two
inches
in
diameter.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
yes,
there
is.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
well,
it
depends.
i
think
it
would
--
in
your
honor's
case,
there
would
be
a
mind
too,
and
i
think
there
would
be
in
most
railroad
work
now.
mr.
herbert
j.
deany
thank
you.
