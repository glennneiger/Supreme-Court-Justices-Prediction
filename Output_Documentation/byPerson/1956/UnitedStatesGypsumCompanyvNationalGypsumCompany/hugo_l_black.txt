identified.
justice
hugo
l.

is
that
all
of
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
is
that
all?
justice
hugo
l.

all
the
references?
justice

did
you
ever
file
any
answer
or
any
kind
of
paper
which
told
the
court
that
the
foregoing
things
will
show
that
we
have
purged
ourselves
and
we
wished
to
have
a
chance
to
prove
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
where
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
want
to
see
is
if
you
offer
us,
if
you
tended
to
the
court
issues
of
facts
concretely
stating
that
you
wanted
to
have
a
chance
to
prove
those
issues
of
facts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
that
--
these
that
you
have
are
not
the
type
of
statements
that
i'm
talking
about.
i
understand
this
--
the
claim
of
the
other
side
is
that
you
never
did
tender
any
issues
of
fact
concretely
and
offer
to
show
that
you
had
purged
yourself
by
the
following
--
by
reasons
or
the
following
things
that
gypsum
had
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
offer
of
proof.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
did
you
ever,
during
this
time,
state
that
we
want
to
show
that
we
purged
ourselves?
we've
dissipated
the
misuse
of
the
patents
by
the
following
--
by
a
proof
of
the
following
circumstances
or
we
offered
a
--
offered
a
--
we
want
to
show
facts
of
this
kind.
justice
hugo
l.
black
those
that
i've
looked
at
did
not
tender
such
an
issue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
they
do.
