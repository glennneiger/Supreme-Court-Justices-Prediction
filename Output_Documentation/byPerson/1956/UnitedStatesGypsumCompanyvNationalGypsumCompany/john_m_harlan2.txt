justice
john
m.
harlan
did
you
ask
for
a
hearing?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
does
the
modification
of
the
decree
bar
you
--
bar
only
the
maintenance
of
suits
for
the
pendente
lite
period
or
does
it
bar
the
maintenance
of
infringement
suits
beyond
the
pendente
lite
period?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
--
as
i
read
the
opinion,
i
thought
he
left
that
post
--
that
post
litigation
period
to
the
southern
district
and
to
the
suits
of
the
court's
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
jurisdiction?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
i
was
referring
to
is
on
page
39
of
the
appendix,
the
district
court's
opinion.
you're
referring
to
the
newark
and
ebsary
defenses
and
the
court
says,
“we
think
trial
of
that
issue,
that
is
after
1951
before
the
complaint
before
the
new
york
and
the
new
jersey
district
court
should
not
be
interfered
with
here.”
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
because
they
are
settled.
justice
john
m.
harlan
no?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
go
ahead.
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
i
read
the
wrong
opinion.
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
did
the
rate
of
royalty
under
the
present
license
agreements,
the
post-decree
license
agreements
compare
with
the
rate
of
royalty
that
would
have
been
chargeable
under
the
illegal
agreements?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
post-1941
evidence
is
there
to
support
that
finding?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
any
way
you
want.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
up
to
1948.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
but
my
point
is
that
so
far
as
quantum
meruit
is
concerned,
that
is
eliminating
counts
i
and
ii,
you
have
to
stand
on
the
proposition,
i
take
it,
that
there
was
a
fresh
misuse
between
1948
and
1941
--
1948
and
1951
or
that
if
the
pre-1948
use
--
misuse
pervaded
the
post-1948
situation
that
there
was
no
purge
after
1948.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
the
two
things
that
you
referred
to,
namely,
the
price
fixing
arrangements,
certainly
those
were
not
involved
in
the
post-1948
situation
because
they
have
been
eliminated.
and
so
far
as
the
other
element
is
concerned
to
wit
the
charging
of
royalties
on
unpatented
products,
i
did
not
understand
that
the
claim
for
the
interval
for
1948
to
1951
included
a
claim
for
such
royalties.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
therefore,
where
--
is
there
any
evidence
of
--
of
patent
abuse
or
any
evidence
of
lack
of
purge
between
1948
and
1951?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
but
they
say
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
they
say
that
they
offered
to
do
that
and
that
the
court
denied
them
an
opportunity.
