mr.
bruce
bromley
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
by
united
states
gypsum
company
from
a
judgment
entered
in
december
1954
by
a
three-judge
district
court
sitting
in
the
district
of
columbia.
the
appeal
involves
a
post-decree
controversy
between
certain
co-defendants
in
a
government
antitrust
action.
after
the
final
decree
in
the
government
suit,
the
appellant
here,
united
states
gypsum
company,
brought
suit
in
1953
against
companies
that
had
been
its
co-defendants
in
the
prior
government
antitrust
suit
against
the
gypsum
industry.
in
those
1953
post-decree
suits,
usg
asked
compensation
for
the
use
that
its
co-defendants
had
made
of
usg
patents.
in
those
compensation
suits
brought
in
1953
against
the
appellees,
national
gypsum
and
the
certain-teed
company,
usg
claims
payment
for
patent
use
made
by
those
companies
in
the
period
from
march
8,
1948
to
may
15,
1951.
now,
those
two
days
coincide
first
with
the
entry
in
1948
of
the
first
decision
by
this
court
in
the
government
antitrust
suit
and
the
1951
date
with
the
date
in
which
the
final
decree
in
the
government
suit
was
entered
below.
so
the
period,
the
1948-1951
period
in
question
is
a
pendente
lite
period
for
which
defendant,
usg,
sought
after
final
decree
to
obtain
compensation
for
the
use
which
the
co-defendants
had
made
of
its
patents.
the
1954
judgment
of
the
court
below,
the
judgment
from
which
this
appeal
is
taken,
orders
modification
of
the
1951
final
decree
in
the
government
suit
to
the
extent
that
it
now
enjoins
usg
from
the
further
prosecution
of
its
pending
lawsuits
to
recover
compensation
for
the
pendente
lite
use
of
the
patents
which
--
as
co-defendants
made
before
the
entry
of
the
final
decree.
since
the
judgment
below
inextricably
wedge
issues
raised
by
these
compensation
suits
and
issues
adjudicated
by
the
1951
decree,
i
am
forced
to
give
some
history
of
the
government
suit
because
i
believe
it
to
be
critically
important
to
the
present
consideration.
the
government
antitrust
suit
against
the
gypsum
industry
was
in
the
courts
a
long
time.
the
government
filed
its
complaint
in
1940.the
government,
in
april
1944,
finished
putting
in
its
evidence
at
the
trial.
none
of
that
evidence
thus
introduced
in
a
trial
in
1943
and
1944
related
to
events
subsequent
to
1941.
in
other
words,
the
record
below
ended
with
proof
of
facts
up
to
1941.
at
the
government
trial,
at
the
conclusion
of
its
proof,
as
the
court
may
remember,
the
defendants
moved
under
1941
to
dismiss
the
complaint
on
the
ground
that
the
government
had
failed
to
raise
a
prima
facie
case.
that
motion
was
granted
by
the
district
court
and
was
reversed
here
on
march
8,
1948.
immediately
after
the
decision
of
this
court
and
as
our
co-defendants
alleged
because
of
it,
appellees
national
and
certain-teed
stopped
paying
any
money
to
usg
for
the
use
they
were
then
making
of
the
usg
patents.
following
remand
from
this
court's
decision
of
march
1948,
the
district
court
suggested
that
the
government
file
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
under
rule
56
and
that
the
defendants
file
a
proper
approval.
that
was
done.
in
june
1948,
a
majority
of
the
court
below
granted
the
government's
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
in
november
1949,
in
the
midst
of
this
pendente
lite
period,
a
final
decree
was
entered.
usg
appealed
from
that
november
1949
final
decree
on
the
ground
that
we
had
a
right
to
introduce
material
evidence
and
the
situation
was
not
proper
for
summary
judgment.
this
court
dismissed
that
appeal.
the
reason
for
the
dismissal
was
later
stated
by
the
court
to
be
as
follows,
and
i
venture
to
quote
it
because
i
think
it's
important.
“this
court
said
we
read
the
preliminary
statement
of
the
district
court
to
the
decree
and
the
summary
decree
itself
as
an
adjudication
of
violation
of
the
sherman
act
by
the
action
in
concert
of
the
defendants
through
fixed-price
licenses
accepting
as
true,
the
underlying
facts
in
defendants'
proof
by
proffer.”
the
trial
judges
understood
the
summary
judgment
to
be,
as
judge
steven
said,
limited
to
that
one
disputed
issue
and
that
conclusion
entitled
the
government
only
to
relief
based
on
that
finding
and
the
proffered
facts.
on
that
basis,
we
dismissed
usg's
appeal
from
the
decree.
now,
the
government
had
also
appealed
from
that
decree.
this
court
noted
jurisdiction.
the
government
sought
enlargement
of
some
of
the
provisions
of
the
decree
and
subsequent
approval
by
this
court
of
some
of
those
government
proposals
for
modification
of
the
decree
below
made
it
necessary
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
and
to
remand
it
for
further
proceedings
below
in
conformity
with
the
court's
second
opinion
and
required
a
recasting
in
some
particulars
of
the
1949
decree.
so
it
was
that
on
may
15,
1951,
the
district
court
entered
its
final
decree
in
the
government
suit.
no
appeal
was
taken
by
anybody.
the
article
of
that
1951
final
decree,
an
article
inherited
from
the
1949
decree,
is
particularly
pertinent
to
this
appeal
and
its
article
iv.
it
merely
declares
each
of
the
patent
license
agreements,
which
had
price
fixing
clauses
in
them,
to
be
illegal,
null
and
void.
the
final
decree,
however,
contained
no
injunction
of
any
kind
against
suits
for
pendente
lite
compensation
for
a
patent
use.
now,
none
of
the
proposed
decrees
or
amendments
thereto
submitted
to
the
district
court
by
the
government
or
by
the
defendants
in
connection
with
either
the
1949
decree
or
the
1951
final
decree
or
dealt
in
any
way
with
the
right
of
any
person
to
sue,
to
--
to
use
usg
patents
without
compensation
during
the
pendente
lite
period.
indeed,
the
day
after
the
1951
final
decree
was
entered,
united
states
gypsum
wrote
a
letter
to
each
one
of
its
co-defendant
licensees.
it
said
it
indented
to
comply
strictly
with
the
provisions
of
the
decree
and
referring
to
the
old
license
agreements
noted
in
the
letter
that
their
provisions
have
here
--
heretofore
become
and
now
are
wholly
canceled
and
of
no
effect.
in
those
letters,
usg
referred
to
the
fact
that
royalties
had
not
been
paid
under
the
patent
license
agreements
since
early
1948
nor,
said
usg,
had
it
sought
to
collect
them
but
if
that
had
merely
stood
upon
its
right
to
be
compensated
for
the
reasonable
value
of
any
use
which
its
co-defendants
had
made
of
its
patents.
none
of
the
defendants
made
any
move
anywhere
to
challenge
the
assertion
of
that
right,
either
before
the
court
below
or
otherwise.
appellees
national
and
certain-teed
subsequently
made
application
under
the
compulsory
licensing
provisions
of
the
decree
for
licenses
under
those
patents
and
of
course,
they
were
promptly
granted.
but
when
it
became
obvious
in
1953
that
these
companies
did
not
intend
to
pay
or
make
any
settlement
for
the
pendente
lite
use
of
the
patents,
usg
was
the
face
--
was
faced
with
the
alternative
of
bringing
suit
or
forfeiting
its
rights.
accordingly,
in
january
and
march
of
1953,
usg
sued
national
and
certain-teed
in
the
northern
district
of
iowa,
which
was
a
court
of
entirely
competent
jurisdiction.
when
usg
determined
to
sue
for
this
patent
use
in
iowa,
it
had
to
draft
the
complaint,
i
submit,
to
meet
all
factual
situations
that
might
develop
upon
the
trial
of
that
action.
and
so
it
was
that
each
complaint
in
those
suits,
which
the
court
below
by
amendment
is
now
ordered
and
dismissed
with
prejudice,
so
it
was
that
each
complaint
in
those
suits
contains
several
counts.
count
i
is
for
royalties
due,
for
actual
use
of
the
patents
based
on
the
royalty
rate
provided
for
under
the
prior
license
agreement
between
usg
and
the
respective
defendant
which
had
been
declared
to
be
null
and
void.
count
ii
contains
account
for
those
royalties
under
that
license
agreement
as
amended
according
to
the
allegations.
a
third
count
is
included
for
recovery
of
reasonable
compensation
for
the
actual
use
of
the
patents
after
the
license
agreement
was
terminated,
according
to
the
allegations
under
circumstances
from
which
the
law
would
imply
a
promise
to
pay.
a
fourth
count
is
a
count
of
quantum
meruit
for
reasonable
compensation
for
the
use
of
the
patents.
and
finally,
a
count
for
infringement
of
the
patents
--
under
the
patent
laws
of
united
states
is
asserted
in
those
complaints.
answers
were
filed
by
national
and
certain-teed
to
any
issue
on
all
material
averments
and
pleading
especially
among
other
things
that
each
suit
was
barred
by
the
declaration
of
illegality
in
the
1951
final
decree.
thereafter,
commencing
with
the
petition
filed
by
national
in
march
of
1953,
each
of
the
appellees
had,
by
june
1953,
filed
separate
petitions
in
the
old
statutory
antitrust
government
court
here
in
the
district.
now,
the
petition
of
national
thus
filed
for
relief
against
our
suits,
prayed
that
the
suit
brought
against
it
for
the
actual
use
of
the
patents
be
enjoin.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
sir.
there
were
answers
made
by
the
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
was
asserted.
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
bromley
stayed.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
bromley
stayed.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
because
of
the
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
it
rested
there.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
very
promptly.
mr.
bruce
bromley
closely
together.
mr.
bruce
bromley
now,
the
petition
of
national
below
prayed
that
the
suits
brought
against
it
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
stayed
by
the
trial
court
in
iowa,
sir,
awaiting
determination
here.
and
if
national
petitioned
here,
said
that
the
court
ought
to
modify
it
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
no
stay
issued
here,
just
the
iowa
court
issued
its
own
stay.
mr.
bruce
bromley
oh,
no,
sir,
of
the
proceeding
below.
mr.
bruce
bromley
although
they
stay
encompasses
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
now,
the
national
petition
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
sir.
the
petitions
below,
which
i
now
about
to
describe,
asked
for
a
further
provision
in
the
decree
which
specifically
order
us
to
dismiss
with
prejudice
these
pending
compensation
suits
in
iowa.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
sir.
the
court
below
has
now
amended
by
adding
a
provision
to
it
which
orders
us
to
dismiss
with
prejudice
our
suits
before
spring.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
bromley
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
bromley
now,
the
national
petitioned
as
a
ground
for
this
relief,
asserts
that
the
very
bringing
by
united
states
gypsum
of
these
suits
for
infringement
in
recovery
of
compensation
constitute
a
misuse
of
the
patents
under
--
under
the
morton
salt
case.
the
national
petitioned
below
contained
an
alternative
claim.
it
asked
the
modification
of
the
decree
below
to
bar
us
from
suing
on
the
ground
that
we
had
been
guilty
of
patent
misuse
during
the
1948-1951
period
in
question
in
eight
different
and
specifically
detailed
respects.
in
other
words,
it
alleged
that
during
that
period,
in
spite
of
the
injunctions
against
us,
we
had
misused
our
patents
and
it
specified
power,
according
to
the
petition,
it
alleged
we
have.
in
june
1953,
the
government
filed
a
petition
below.
the
government
did
not
adopt
the
position
of
national.
it
took
the
position
only
that
we
have
no
right
to
declare
upon
the
license
agreements
as
a
basis
for
our
recovery
because
it
said
they
had
been
declared
to
be
illegal.
mr.
bruce
bromley
however,
the
government's
position
was,
insofar
as
our
other
counts
are
concerned
for
quantum
meruit
and
infringement,
if
you
please,
they
took
no
position
as
to
whether
they
were
barred
by
the
final
decree
or
as
to
whether
they
should
be
barred,
saying
it's
a
private
dispute
among
private
parties
in
which
the
government
has
no
interest.
in
september
1953,
usg
filed
its
answers
to
those
petitions
below
of
national
and
certain-teed
and
in
our
answers,
we
put
an
issue,
every
allegation
of
every
fact
that
was
alleged,
and
we
alleged
affirmative
facts
as
of
--
additional
facts
as
affirmative
defenses.
in
july
1954,
one
judge
dissenting
that
a
court
below
filed
an
opinion
ruling
that
further
prosecution
of
our
suit
should
be
enjoin.
now,
the
district
court
made
that
determination
on
that
modification
of
the
decree
without
hearing
any
evidence
whatsoever.
and
the
decree
was
made
in
december
9,
1954,
adding
a
paragraph
specifically
ordering
us
to
dismiss
our
suits
with
prejudice.
mr.
bruce
bromley
we
asked
for
a
hearing
time
and
again.
yes,
sir.
all
we
had
was
a
trial
by
briefs
on
two
days
and
a
lot
of
argument.
mr.
bruce
bromley
no,
we
did
not
proffer
any
evidence
specifically.
our
position
was
that
we
were
there
on
a
petition
which
alleged
eight
specific
acts
of
misuse
in
detail.
we
denied
them
in
our
answer,
asserted
affirmatively
in
our
answer
that
we
have
not
committed
any
one
of
the
alleged
acts.
and
during
the
argument,
i
think
it
was
conceded
by
judge
rosenman
that
there
were
factual
issues
there,
but
the
court
decided
to
take
care
of
the
matter
by
a
decision,
which
i
say
was
on
the
law
that
the
bringing
of
the
suits
was
misused.
we
made
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
in
which
we
said,
“well,
you
haven't
disposed
the
claim
too
because
you
never
heard
us,
and
we
ask
now
that
you
hear
us.”
we
really
asked.
we
asked
now
that
judge
rosenman
to
be
compelled
to
go
ahead
and
offer
some
proof.
all
he'd
done
is
made
some
allegations.
he
hadn't
made
any
proof,
so
we
asked
that
they
go
ahead
and
prove
their
case
and
that
we
give
a
chance
to
--
to
prove
that
we
haven't
done
those
things
or
we
had
ever
done
and
we
purged
it.
mr.
bruce
bromley
couldn't
contest
that.
mr.
bruce
bromley
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
bromley
oh,
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
bromley
we'll
need
any
evidence
about
that.
that
was
just
wrong.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
sir.
and
that's
the
first
question,
i
submit,
is
presented
here.
mr.
bruce
bromley
well,
i
think
it
--
i
don't
think
it
did.
i
think
it
asserted
that
some
of
the
allegations
of
misuse
had
been
proved
although
there
hadn't
been.
there's
a
--
there's
a
conflict,
i
think,
and
a
little
doubt
as
to
what
they
did
decide.
but
i
--
my
position
is
all
they
decided
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
bringing
of
the
suits
was
annulled.
mr.
bruce
bromley
no,
sir.
mr.
bruce
bromley
no,
sir.
all
it
said
was
that
its
position
was
that
the
declaration
of
nullity
barred
our
counts
on
the
license
agreements,
but
it
didn't
take
any
position
that
our
bringing
of
those
claims
barred
us
from
asserting
the
infringement
claims.
mr.
bruce
bromley
that's
perfectly
right,
sir.
i
think,
perhaps,
i
should
try
to
state
as
briefly
as
i
can
what
i
understand
to
be
the
basis
of
the
decision
below.
first,
the
court
notes
that
in
our
compensation
suits,
counts
i
and
ii
are
bottom
directly
on
the
license
agreements
declared
null
and
void.
and
after
making
that
observation,
the
court
below
concludes
that
the
effect
of
the
final
decree,
although
it
had
no
injunction
in
it
whatsoever
in
this
area,
was
to
bar
us
from
prosecuting
counts
i
and
ii
of
our
pending
claims.
but
the
district
court
also
concluded,
and
i
quote
it,
“that
the
1951
decree
did
not
bar
expressly
nor
impliedly
the
character
of
suits
asserted
for
infringement
or
quantum
meruit.”
now,
despite
that
latter
conclusion
that
the
final
decree
didn't
bar
us
from
suing
for
an
infringement
or
quantum
meruit,
the
district
court
nonetheless
has
modified
the
decree
to
bar
the
assertion
of
those
claims
and
to
order
their
dismissal
with
prejudice.
now,
just
what
is
the
misuse
that
the
court
below
found
in
its
decision?
mr.
bruce
bromley
beyond
the
pendente
lite
period
because
there
were
two
of
these
people
who
would
use
the
patents
after
the
final
decree
became
effective
without
ever
taking
compulsory
licensing
and
we
were
ordered
to
dismiss
as
to
them.
now,
we're
in
this
posture
here
that's
moot
because
they
have
settled.
mr.
bruce
bromley
no,
mr.
justice.
mr.
bruce
bromley
no,
mr.
justice.
he
ordered
the
dismissal
of
those
--
those
very
suits,
ebsary
and
newark
in
which
we
had
claims
for
post-decree
infringement
and
use
of
our
patents.
but
that's
not
before
us
because
they're
out.
can
you
point
where
that
is?
mr.
bruce
bromley
well,
at
page
1160,
the
provision
of
the
judgment
is
quoted,
and
it
orders
dismissal
of
newark
and
ebsary
completely.
mr.
bruce
bromley
oh,
no,
no.
mr.
bruce
bromley
no,
no,
that
was
entered
long
before
they
are
settled.
mr.
bruce
bromley
oh,
that
opinion
was
corrected
later
on
our
motion
for
new
trial
in
that
respect.
mr.
bruce
bromley
wrong
opinion.
yes,
sir.
now,
assuming
that
the
court
had
jurisdiction
to
do
what
it
did,
a
point
which
we
deny
and
which
we
argue
fully
in
our
brief
and
which
we
do
not
and
cannot
waive,
i
submit
that
this
appeal
raises
two
noble
questions.
first,
i
submit
that
this
court
must
decide
whether
it
was
error
to
hold,
as
the
court
did
below,
that
prosecution
by
us
of
our
compensation
suits
pleading
counts
on
the
voided
license
agreements
is,
as
a
matter
of
law,
misuse
of
the
patents.
if
that
--
if
that
question
be
decided
in
our
favor,
then
there
--
the
court
will
reach
a
second
substantial
question
which
is
whether
it
was
error
to
hold,
as
the
court
did
below,
that
the
issues
of
patent
misuse
other
than
the
bringing
of
our
suits
in
the
1948-1951
period
raised
in
the
petitions
below
and
denied
by
the
answers
below
might
be
adjudicated
without
the
taking
of
any
evidence.
we
recognized
that
if
this
second
question
is
decided
in
our
favor
then
at
last
we
would
reach
those
issues
which
have
excited
the
government,
and
those
issues
which
interest
the
government
are
two.
first,
they
are
interested
in
a
declaration
of
what
forum
is
more
appropriate
for
litigating
the
facts
of
alleged
misuse
and
purge,
the
antitrust
court
below
or
the
courts
in
which
the
compensation
suits
are
pending.
and
secondly,
they
are
interested
in
having
this
court
now
declare
what
factual
and
legal
criteria
should
be
applied
in
determining
misuse
and
purge,
a
request,
which
we
submit,
is
entirely
premature.
now,
i
turn
to
the
first
substantial
question.
was
the
pleading
of
our
counts
on
these
voided
license
agreements
a
per
se
misuse
by
us
of
our
patents?
we
submit
that
it
was
not.
first,
we
say
that
it
can
never
be
a
misuse
of
patents
for
a
party
to
seek
interpretation
of
an
equity
decree
that
purports
to
regulate
those
patent
rights.
this
is
most
certainly
true,
i
submit,
in
the
case
of
any
decree
containing
a
term
as
this
did
upon
which
reasonable
men
might
differ
as
to
its
meaning.
that
is
a
flat
declaration
of
nullity
unaccompanied
by
any
injunction.
appellees
national
and
certain-teed
urged
below
and
still
urge
that
the
illegal
null
and
void
language
of
article
iv
bars
our
recovery
on
any
theory
of
law
for
compensation
pendente
lite
for
the
use
of
our
patents.
the
united
states,
both
in
the
court
below
and
in
this
court,
has
suggested
still
another
meaning
of
this
declaration
of
nullity.
they
merely
say
if
i
said
that
it
prescribes
recovery
on
our
counts
on
the
agreements
but
is
entirely
neutral
as
to
whether
we
should
be
barred
from
suing
for
infringement
or
quantum
meruit.
now,
implicit
in
that
governmental
position,
i
submit,
is
a
recognition
that
on
this
record,
the
public
interest
does
not
require
that
we'd
be
barred
from
recovering
compensation
for
the
use
of
our
patents
on
theories
either
of
quantum
meruit
or
infringement.
the
decision
of
the
court
below
falls
somewhere
in
between
those
two.
thus,
they
found
expressly
that
the
declaration
of
nullity
did
not
bar
our
counts
for
infringement
or
for
quantum
meruit
but
they
reached
the
results
of
bar
by
charging
us
with
a
continuing
misuse
for
having
failed
to
guess
what
the
court
only
later
discovered
that
the
illegal
null
and
void
language
was
intended
to
restrain
us
from
even
declaring
on
the
no
license
agreements,
that
is
if
they
were
not
separable
but
were
totally
destroyed.
now,
when
--
when
we
had
the
draft
of
the
complaints
in
the
1953
compensation
suits,
we
sincerely
believe
that
the
effect
of
article
iv
was
only
to
prescribe
future
performance
or
enforcement
of
the
patent
royalty
terms
of
the
old
agreements,
and
the
court
below
has
recognized
that
that's
been
our
position
for
years.
i
submit
that
the
record
below,
and
i
think
it
must
be
examined,
provides
a
solid
basis
for
entertainment
by
us
in
1953
of
our
belief
that
article
iv
merely
canceled
the
agreements
as
of
the
date
of
the
entry
of
the
final
decree
and
did
not
bar
suits
under
them
for
royalties
in
the
pre-1951
period.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
bromley
well,
that's
a
--
that's
a
--
a
difficult
proposition
to
answer,
but
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes.
mr.
bruce
bromley
it
does.
perhaps,
i
can
just
briefly
say
this.
mr.
bruce
bromley
well,
i'll
come
to
that
later.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
bromley
now,
i
want
to
demonstrate
before
i
come
to
that
that
we
had
a
solid
basis
when
we
drew
these
complaints
for
believing
that
all
the
decree
did
that
--
that
the
decree
did
not
bar
suits
for
pendente
lite
royalties.
and
i
have
to
go
through
this
demonstration
because
these
decrees
were
molded
carefully
below
and
have
a
long
history.
following
its
grant
from
the
bench
in
1948
of
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
the
government,
the
--
the
court
below
requested
that
all
of
us
submit
drafts.
in
november
1948,
the
government
had
entered
the
draft.
nowhere
in
that
government
draft
was
it
suggested
that
the
license
agreements
were
to
be
declared
unenforceable
in
toto.
indeed,
it
only
--
that
decree
only
contemplated
a
cancellation
and
the
bar
of
future
performance
under
the
licenses.
indeed,
under
the
government's
proposal,
the
licenses
were
to
have
continuing
vitality
for
as
much
as
60
days
after
entry
of
the
final
judgment.
thereafter,
usg
submitted
a
draft.
our
draft
only
provided
for
cancellation
and
termination
of
license
agreements
upon
entry
of
the
final
decree.
now,
those
drafts
of
the
united
states
and
usg
were
the
only
drafts
before
the
court
below
when
it
sat
on
june
13,
1949
to
hear
argument
on
the
form
of
the
decree.
in
the
course
of
that
argument,
several
significant
things
happened.
on
june
14,
mr.
dallstream
of
chicago
for
celotex
and
certain-teed
and
mr.
knuff,
counsel
for
the
government
submitted
amendment
to
the
proposed
draft
decrees.
those
amendments
declared
the
agreements
illegal,
null
and
void.
mr.
finck
for
national
in
that
argument
also
urged
in
oral
argument
that
the
license
agreements
be
declared
null
and
void.
and
on
june
--
july
16,
1949,
he
submitted
a
proposed
decree
of
his
own,
which,
while
declaring
the
agreements
null
and
void,
merely
ordered
them
canceled
and
forbad
for
the
performance
of
them
after
final
decree.
thus,
the
three
sources
from
which
the
court
below
could
possibly
have
derived
the
null
and
void
language
of
the
final
decree
are
provided
by
the
decrees
and
amendments
submitted
by
the
government,
national
and
usg.
it
only
remains
to
be
determined,
therefore,
whether
any
of
those
parties
in
proposing
this
null
and
void
language
represented
to
the
court
what
the
effect
of
it
was
intended
to
be
upon
suits
for
pendente
lite
royalties.
and
the
fact
is
that
each
of
those
parties
either
informed
the
court
below
that
inclusion
of
this
language
was
to
be
deemed
equivalent
to
simple
cancellation
or
that
the
suggestion
--
that
the
court
declared
the
agreements
null
and
void
was
not
in
any
sense
based
upon
a
desire
to
avoid
pendente
lite
license
fees.
mr.
dallstream,
for
instance,
in
arguing
on
this
date
to
the
court
below
had
this
to
say,
“in
order
that
united
states
gypsum
will
have
no
misunderstanding
in
my
position,
i
want
them
to
know
that
my
suggestion
is
in
no
sense
based
on
any
hope
or
desire
on
my
part
to
get
out
of
any
license
fees
during
the
interim
period.”
and
the
government,
with
respect
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
counsel
for
certain-teed,
sir,
but
he
was
speaking
for
certain-teed.
he
was
counsel
for
celotex,
speaking
for
celotex
and
certain-teed
upon
that
occasion.
and
the
government
had
this
to
say
about
the
effect
of
the
illegal,
null
and
void
language.
this
is
mr.
knuff
with
the
department
of
justice,
“on
the
other
hand,
when
you
were
declaring
them
null
and
void,
null
and
void
could
probably
be
considered
as
a
synonym
for
cancellation.”
and
judge
jackson
said,
“that
would
then
be
the
date
of
the
decree,
would
it,
the
date
of
filing?”
and
government
counsel
said,
“that's
right.”
the
government
has
never
repudiated
its
statement,
thus
made
on
june
14,
1949
that
null
and
void
could
probably
be
considered
as
a
synonym
for
cancellation
in
this
decree.
in
his
argument
on
that
date,
mr.
finck,
for
national,
acknowledged
that
the
proposal
of
the
government
merely
canceled
the
license
agreements
restraining
future
performance.
and
he
expressly
acknowledged
that
the
proposed
decrees
of
both
the
government
and
usg,
unlike
the
decree
entered
in
the
line
material
case,
did
not
contain
any
injunction
against
suits
for
past
infringement
or
breach
of
royalty
contracts.
then
national,
a
month
later
on
july
16,
submitted
to
the
court
below
its
draft
of
proposed
decree.
that
draft
merely
modified
the
government
proposal
to
include
the
declaration
that
the
license
agreements
would
be
deemed
null
and
void.
i
should
like
to
read
the
words
of
this
national
proposal
on
july
16,
1949
because
i
think
it
is
a
great
significance.
it
appears
at
the
record
on
page
432
and
is
entitled,
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
article
vii
and
its
nationals
amendment
to
the
government
proposal
in
this
area.
it's
in
volume
i
of
the
record,
page
432
and
its
headed
article
vii,
that
each
and
all
of
the
patent
license
agreements
and
other
arrangements
relating
to
board
and
so
forth
are
hereby
declared
to
be
null
and
void
and
are
hereby
canceled.
each
defendant
company
is
hereby
enjoined
and
restrained
from
further
performance
of
any
such
agreement
and
so
on.
mr.
bruce
bromley
that
was
not
adopted.
the
only
thing
the
court
adopted
was
the
declaration
that
it
was
illegal,
null
and
void
without
any
injunctions.
i'm
only
referring
the
court
to
this
as
a
matter
of
aiding
in
the
interpretation
of
what
the
court
meant
when
it
used
illegal,
null
and
void.
now,
counsel
for
national
have
given
to
the
court
an
imposing
looking
document
entitled
"development
of
final
decree",
and
it's
this
document
that
i
hold
in
my
hand.
it
purports
to
show
the
positions
of
the
parties
with
the
respect
to
the
nullification
provisions
of
the
1951
final
decree,
but
it
omits
entirely
any
reference
to
the
july
16,
1949
proposal
of
national.
and
it
seeks
to
create
the
impression,
i
fear,
that
the
national
position
in
1949
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
position
that
on
--
that
national
now
adopts
before
this
court,
and
that
just
is
not
so.
as
we've
seen
the
null
and
void
language
proffered
in
the
national
july
16
draft,
served
no
other
purpose
than
justification
for
cancellation
and
restraint
of
future
performance.
this
document
by
reason
of
that
omission,
i'd
submit,
becomes
useless
because
it's
incomplete,
and
to
that
extent,
it
is
misleading
and
either
should
be
taken
back
and
correct
it
or
destroy
it.
furthermore,
the
corporate
appellees
have
considered
or
have
conceded
that
by
july
25,
1949
in
the
course
of
these
hearings
on
the
decree
before
the
lower
court
that
usg
had
began
to
suspect
that
the
corporate
appellees'
purposes
in
pressing
for
inclusion
of
this
null
and
void
language
in
the
face
of
the
cancellation
proposals
was
to
obtain
for
themselves
some
advantage
with
respect
to
their
use
of
usg
patents,
and
usg
called
its
suspicions
to
the
attention
of
the
lower
court.
corporate
appellees,
however,
never
affirmed
or
denied
to
the
court
the
correctness
of
our
suspicions.
they
merely
continued
to
stand
upon
the
reasons
they
previously
given
for
including
illegal,
null
and
void,
which
reasons,
of
course,
did
not
include
any
suggestion
that
the
intent
of
the
language
was
to
avoid
payment
for
their
use
of
our
patents.
it
is
submitted,
therefore,
that
all
proponents
of
the
null
and
void
language
in
the
court
below
that
finally
appeared
in
the
final
judgment,
either
expressly
or
by
strong
implication
informed
both
the
district
court
and
usg
that
inclusion
of
that
language
was
not
intended
as
a
bar
to
collection
by
us
of
compensation
from
persons
who
had
used
our
patents
pendente
lite.
now,
it's
against
this
background
that
we,
lawyers,
when
we
came
to
draft
the
complaint
for
compensation
saw
fit
to
make
it
in
six
counts,
the
first
two
of
which
declared
upon
the
voided
license
agreements,
either
directly
or
as
amended
according
to
our
allegations.
now,
i
submit
that
not
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
well,
it's
in
our
appendix
of
the
appellant's
brief.
mr.
bruce
bromley
it's
1152
in
the
record
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
562
of
the
record,
is
that
right?
562
of
the
record,
volume
i.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
sir.
are
not
to
have
pleaded
counts
on
these
voided
license
agreements
would
have
been
full
argued
from
the
standpoint
of
counsel.
we
had
to
state
a
claim
that
would
have
covered
any
situation
reasonably
to
be
expected
to
arise
upon
the
trial.
clearly,
if
it
could
be
established
upon
the
trial
that
the
license
agreements
have
been
abandoned
and
repudiated
for
the
parties
following
the
first
decision
by
this
court
or
had
been
voided
by
that
decision,
then
of
course
subsequent
use
of
the
patents
would
have
laid
the
users
open
to
claims
of
infringement
or
quantum
meruit.
on
the
other
hand,
if
we
were
to
confine
the
assertion
of
our
claims
to
infringement
or
quantum
meruit
and
one
of
these
defendants
were
to
defend
by
claiming
the
right
to
use
the
patent
under
the
old
voided
license
agreement,
we'd
be
confronted
with
the
court
below
concluding
that
there
was
an
unasserted
claim
under
the
contract
for
all
or
a
part
of
the
pertinent
period
which
would
defeat
recovery
on
quantum
meruit
or
infringement.
and
indeed,
the
eighth
defense
to
count
v
in
our
suit
in
iowa,
the
infringement
count
by
national,
actually
raises
this
defense
that
they're
not
liable
for
infringement
because
they
had
a
license
agreement.
therefore,
their
use
of
the
patents
was
not
unauthorized
but
authorized
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
court
had
saw
--
seem
fit
to
declare
that
agreement
illegally.
now,
although
you
may
recognize
the
validity
of
this
dilemma,
you
may
well
ask
me
why
in
the
world
did
you
ever
plea
this
in
the
form
of
separate
counts.
well,
if
i
had
it
to
do
over
again
in
the
light
of
the
education,
which
i
have
subsequently
received,
i
might
plead
it
now
differently
in
form
at
least.
i
might
abide
by
the
spirit
of
the
new
rules
and
just
make
a
narrative
statement
of
what's
happened
to
this,
giving
a
history
of
the
facts
in
the
gypsum
industry
since
1940,
the
government
suit,
the
appeals,
the
decree
and
the
use
by
the
defendants
of
the
patents
leaving
the
theory
of
legal
relief
to
the
court.
now,
that
--
to
plead
that
way
might
eliminate
any
possibility
of
a
court,
i
submit,
stumbling
into
this
continuing
misuse
of
patents
theory
by
virtue
of
the
words
we
used
when
we
declared
on
the
voided
license
agreement.
but
it
wouldn't,
of
course,
may
clear
the
court
what
our
legal
theories
were
in
the
pleading
and
neither
would
it
have
eliminated
a
single
issue
that
is
not
already
a
part
of
a
trial
and
whatever
form
the
complaint
takes
of
a
compensation
suit.
in
any
such
trial,
it
would
still
be
necessary
just
as
it
was
below
for
the
court
to
decide
whether
and
on
what
theories,
if
any,
compensation
to
usg
was
barred
by
the
illegal
null
and
void
language
of
the
decree
and
the
court
would
have
to
look
to
the
parties
and
the
history
in
order
to
determine
that
question.
now,
furthermore,
it
is
clear
from
conclusion
7
and
13
of
the
court
below,
which
appear
at
record
1156,
conclusion
7
and
13,
that
if,
in
1953,
we
had
not
pleaded
counts
on
the
old
license
agreements,
the
1951
decree
would
not
have
barred
compensation
suits
based
on
the
other
counts.
that's
the
second
paragraph
of
conclusion
7.
if
we
had
not
pleaded
those
counts,
then
the
court,
as
it
did,
would
hold
that
the
other
counts
were
not
barred
by
the
decree.
i
further
think
it's
clear
that
if
we
hadn't
pleaded
those
counts,
we'd
not
been
deemed
to
have
misused
our
patents
from
1948
to
1953,
1156,
conclusion
7
and
13.
and
finally,
if
we
hadn't
pleaded
those
counts,
i
think
it's
clear
from
those
conclusions
the
court
wouldn't
have
modified
the
final
decree,
but
we
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
strange
but
sound.
mr.
bruce
bromley
exactly,
sir.
it's
exactly
what
they
did.
but
we
already
know
what
would
have
happened
in
1953
if,
in
it's
--
in
our
compensation
suits,
we'd
merely
pleaded
infringement
or
quantum
meruit,
the
old
license
agreements
would
have
been
pleaded
in
defense
just
as
they
now
have
been.
the
issue
of
the
validity
of
those
agreements
would
have
been
raised
for
decision,
and
it
would
have
been
a
question
had
we
so
limited
our
pleading
in
the
face
of
those
agreements
whether
we
were
entitled
a
relief
for
infringement.
however,
one
serious
difference
would
have
arisen
if
the
court
had
determined
that
the
only
--
the
old
license
agreements
were
only
canceled
and
that
the
bar
was
only
a
future
bar,
then
we'd
be
out
of
court
because
we
couldn't
turn
and
sue
on
the
license
agreements
because
the
statute
of
limitations
by
1953
had
started
to
run
against
the
1948-1951
period.
and
also,
if
we
had
filed
such
an
incomplete
pleading,
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata
on
the
theory
that
we
had
an
opportunity
to
plead
it,
might
very
well
have
barred
us
if
we
turned
around
and
started
later
to
declare
in
another
fashion.
now,
i
submit
it's
just
--
to
avoid
just
such
hazards
of
good
faith
prosecution
of
a
claim
that
the
federal
rules
permit
a
party
to
plead
alternative
claims
and
inconsistent
to
counts
--
accounts
and
declare
that
the
insufficiency
of
one
or
more
doesn't
render
the
whole
pleading
defective.
i
come
to
the
second
substantial
question
having
established
my
own
satisfaction
at
least
that
the
court
was
wrong
in
holding
that
the
filing
of
our
suits
on
the
counts
i
and
ii
was
a
per
se
misuse
of
our
patents.
now,
was
it
error
to
hold
as
the
court
did
that
it
could
resolve
this
second
question
without
the
taking
of
any
evidence?
and
the
second
question
was
without
regard
to
filing
the
suits
now,
we
had
otherwise
misused
our
patents
in
the
1948-1951
period.
and
this
petition
of
national,
i
emphasize
again,
it
was
a
very
detailed
allegation,
just
exactly
what
it
--
we
were
alleged
to
have
done
by
way
of
additional
misuse
during
this
pendente
lite
period.
our
answers
were
very
specific
denials
that
we
haven't
done
any
such
thing.
those
pleadings
then
plus
the
record
of
the
old
government
suit
below
constitute
the
complete
record
upon
which
the
court
below
entered
its
judgment
of
modification.
remember,
if
you
will
please,
that
the
last
word
in
the
old
record
before
the
court
below
dealt
with
the
economic
and
technological
state
of
the
gypsum
industry
no
later
than
1941
and
that
the
period
in
question
for
which
we
are
charged
with
having
been
guilty
of
misuse
was
1948
to
1951.
now,
the
corporate
appellees
apparently
sensing
that
those
deficiencies
in
the
record
undercut
the
basis
of
the
judgment
below
in
this
area
asked
this
court
to
resort
to
illegal
fiction
and
to
presume
that
the
conspiracy
established
below
up
to
1941
continued
to
1951.
but
even
assuming
the
accuracy
and
application
to
this
case
of
such
a
legal
theory
and
even
--
even
assuming
its
necessary
corollary
that
the
burden
of
going
forward
was
upon
us
to
rebut
that
presumption
by
showing
purge,
the
stubborn
fact
remains
that
we
are
never
given
the
opportunity
to
go
ahead
and
prove
it.
we
ask
now
that
you'll
give
us
the
chance
first
to
go
back
and
be
met
by
proof
from
the
accusers
as
to
what
it
is
they
say
we
had
done,
and
second,
to
rebut
that
proof
by
showing
if
we
didn't
do
it
or
if
we
did
it
at
any
time,
we
purged
ourselves
of
it.
now,
unfortunately,
the
argument
below,
because
it
was
an
argument,
got
off
into
the
area
of
purge.
and
we
call
the
attention
of
the
court
below
to
certain
facts
which
we
said
are
already
of
record
before
it,
which
we
said
might
very
well,
as
a
matter
of
law,
establish
purge.
and
thus,
for
illustrative
purposes
only,
we
called
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
court
below
in
the
antitrust
suit
had
made
a
finding
that
usg
had
discontinued
its
price
fixing
in
1941.
but
we
said
that
--
that
discontinue
and
so
long
prior
to
the
period
of
1948
to
1951
in
question,
maybe
enough
as
a
matter
of
law
to
establish
purge
and
dissipation
of
unlawful
effects.
we
also
called
the
attention
to
the
court
below
that
the
1948
opinion
of
this
court
established
prima
facie,
the
illegality
of
our
price
fixing
practices.
we
also
said
--
we
also
said
to
the
court
below,
the
record
before
you
shows
that
in
1949,
during
the
discussion
of
the
1949
decree,
we
proffered
legally
unobjectionable
licenses
to
all
of
these
people,
and
they
wouldn't
take
them.
we
also
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
lower
court
had
issued
an
injunction
against
us
in
1949
and
that
this
court
had
entered
a
temporary
injunction
against
us
in
may
of
1950.
and
we
urged
to
the
court
below
in
the
course
of
our
argument
that
if
there
was
any
presumption
to
be
applied,
it
was
a
presumption
of
obedience
to
these
many
pronouncements
of
the
court.
and
that
there
was
no
sense
in
saying
the
presumption
was
we'd
gone
ahead
and
continued
in
the
phase
of
those
declarations
to
violate
the
law.
but
even
if
those
circumstances
do
not
rebut,
the
presumption,
if
there
is
one,
it
still
remains
that
we
should
have
been
allowed
to
go
forward
to
prove
facts
of
purge
extrinsic
of
the
old
record
and
occurring
either
in
the
1948-1951
period
or
subsequent
thereto,
and
we
shouldn't
have
been
pilloried
on
a
trial
by
briefs.
in
connection
with
this
deprivation
of
our
right
to
be
heard
or
to
cross-examine,
i'd
like
to
call
your
attention
to
one
striking
illustration.
the
court
below
in
paragraph
(a)
of
finding
22,
again
record
1150,
makes
a
finding
to
which
all
appellees,
including
the
government,
now
make
a
proving
reference.
there,
the
court
below
was
trying
to
get
around
an
unchallenged
finding
made
in
the
old
government
antitrust
proceeding
that
usg
had
stopped
fixing
prices
in
1941,
to
which
i
alluded
a
moment
ago.
and
in
that
finding
22,
paragraph
(a),
the
court
below
says
that
the
fact
that
usg
had
not
fixed
prices
for
more
than
13
years
is
dissipated
by
the
consideration
that
the
notices
that
we
sent
out
in
1941,
that
minimum
price
bulletins
would
be
suspended
including
this
--
included
the
statement
that
such
suspension
would
continue.
now,
i
quote
from
the
finding,
from
--
from
--
read
a
quotation,
which
is
quoted
in
the
finding,
"until
we
decide
again
to
exercise
our
right
to
do
so."
the
court
says,
that
quotation
from
a
usg
document
is
a
reservation
of
right,
which
dissipates
our
contention
that
abandonment
of
price
fixing
accomplished
purge.
now,
where
did
the
--
where
did
that
quotation
come
from?
it
came
from
a
reply
brief
filed
by
the
opposition.
nowhere
in
the
record
is
there
any
document
that
includes
that
quotation.
it
comes
out
of
a
footnote
in
which
they
say,
“we
sent
a
letter
in
1941
which
--
which
contained
this
reservation
the
right.”
now,
we
might
have
repudiated
it.
it
may
never
have
been
sent.
it
may
have
been
changed.
we
may
not
be
able
to
explain
it
if
we
said
it.
there
are
thousands
speculations
about
it.
we
were
never
given
an
opportunity
to
present
them,
and
we
were
confronted
with
the
finding
and
the
determination
based
on
this
kind
of
evidence.
mr.
bruce
bromley
a
reference
in
the
brief
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
sir,
i
--
above
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
well,
the
document
was
never
offered
or
received
in
evidence.
it
was
never
in
the
record.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
sir.
there
was
a
finding
that
we
seized
fixing
prices
in
1941
but
this
letter
to
which
they
now
refer
was
not
in
the
old
record
and
no
finding
of
us.
they're
not
in
any
record
of
any
case.
they
just
say
we
sent
a
letter
in
connection
with
our
discontinuous
of
price
fixing
in
which
we
said
that
suspension
would
continue,
“until
we
decide
again
to
exercise
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
no,
sir.
it's
my
point
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
no,
sir,
just
this
clause.
mr.
bruce
bromley
no,
sir.
no,
no,
not
referred
to
by
you
at
all.
mr.
bruce
bromley
they
just
used
--
they
just
used
it
because
it
was
in
the
brief.
the
only
thing
these
judges
had
served
before
them
were
briefs
and
arguments.
we
never
had
testimony
or
exhibits
or
hearing.
judge
rosenman
and
i
and
others
talked
for
two
days.
now,
that
is
an
illustration
of
the
vice
of
not
requiring
an
orderly
presentation
of
evidence
with
the
right
of
cross-examination
and
rebuttal.
mr.
bruce
bromley
is
it
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
it
was
identified,
yes.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
sir.
now,
i
say
again
with
the
issue
presented
thus
specifically
by
pleadings.
was
there
any
evidence
of
the
alleged
1948-1951
misuse,
barring
of
course
the
contention
that
our
very
pleading
of
counts
i
and
ii
was
such
misuse?
there
is
none.
national
and
certain-teed
never
met
the
burden.
they
saw
fit
to
raise
themselves
by
the
pleadings.
and
certainly,
we
cannot
be
made
to
assume
the
burden
of
proving
purge
of
alleged
but
unproven
misuse.
may
i
reserve,
sir?
mr.
bruce
bromley
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
in
answer
to
a
question
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
may
have
given
the
impression
that
this
appeal
involves
a
bottom
only
an
interpretation
of
article
iv
of
the
1951
final
decree.
that
is
not
the
case.
now
that
article
iv
of
that
decree
has
been
construed
by
the
court
below
as
nullifying
the
old
license
agreements
as
sources
of
rights,
as
i
understand
it,
for
either
party
in
the
compensation
suits
either
by
way
of
affirmative
claim
or
defense,
usg
can
accept
and
rely
upon
that
adjudication.
that
adjudication
is
the
first
paragraph
of
conclusion
7
at
record
1156.
but
as
i
said
yesterday,
the
court
below
has
also
concluded
that
the
1951
decree
did
not
expressly
or
by
implication
bar
suits
by
usg
for
quantum
meruit
or
infringement.
that
is
the
second
paragraph
of
conclusion
7
at
record
1156.
thus,
in
those
areas,
neither
the
judgment
below
enjoining
the
usg
suits
for
quantum
meruit
or
infringement
nor
this
appeal
are
concerned
with
interpreting
the
1951
decree.
this
appeal
is
directed
to
the
conclusion
of
the
court
below
that
we
misused
our
patents
in
the
1948-1951
period,
and
that
therefore,
the
right
of
usg
to
seek
compensation
on
any
theory
should
be
enjoined
by
supplementing
the
injunctive
reach
of
the
1951
decree.
now,
i
should
like
to
refer
to
those
alleged
misuses
that
judge
rosenman
yesterday
and
today
asserts
and
tell
the
court
below
to
make
the
modification
of
the
decree
that
it
did
make.
he
says
the
court
below
found
two
basic
misuses,
the
fresh
misuse,
that
is
the
bringing
of
the
compensation
suits,
and
secondly,
and
now
more
importantly,
he
says,
and
i
quote
him,
"the
misuse
which
your
honors
have
twice
found
pervaded
this
entire
industry
and
had
been
used
by
usg
to
regimen
and
organize
the
industry
to
refrain
production."
and
he
gives
illustrations
of
price
fixing
on
unpatented
goods
and
the
elimination
of
jobbers
and
so
forth.
now,
i
submit
that
such
a
definition
of
this
alleged
second
misuse
makes
it
clear
that
judge
rosenman
is
speaking
of
a
misuse
which
on
this
record
can
have
occurred
no
later
than
1941.
this
court's
rulings
related
to
a
complaint
filed
in
1940.
as
i've
said
repeatedly,
there
was
no
evidence
concerning
anything
after
1941.
that's
why
i
said
yesterday,
he
must
rely
upon
a
legal
fiction
to
bring
that
down
to
the
1948-1951
period.
and
as
has
been
said
many
times,
we
denied
that
in
our
answers
at
record
788
and
789.
now,
even
if
misuse
proved
to
have
been
a
fact
in
or
before
1940
can
as
a
matter
of
law
be
presumed
to
have
continued
into
the
1948-1951
period.
the
fact
remains
that
we've
never
been
allowed
an
opportunity
to
rebut
that
presumption
by
the
submission
of
evidence
extrinsic
of
the
record
in
the
old
antitrust
case.
it
was
in
connection
with
this
claim
which
we
made
for
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
that
we
call
to
the
court's
attention
certain
facts
already
of
record
before
it
which
we
contended
not
only
prevented
any
summary
ruling
of
unpurged
misuse
but
transferred
the
burden
to
the
corporate
appellees
of
proving
prima
facie
at
least
that
the
patent
misuses
which
they
alleged
had
been
indulged
in
by
us
--
us
during
the
question.
mr.
bruce
bromley
it
is
the
answer.
it
is
record
1046
and
1047.
would
--
would
your
honors
be
good
enough
to
note
these
figures
down?
i'd
give
just
four
of
them.
mr.
bruce
bromley
that
was
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
that
was
objections
to
the
--
to
the
proposed
findings,
i
guess,
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
bruce
bromley
1046,
1047.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
sir.
no,
no,
not
--
that
--
that
was
our
--
no,
it
was
our
objections
and
suggestions
with
--
to
--
with
respect
the
proposed
findings
of
fact
and
that
title
appears
on
1037.
mr.
bruce
bromley
just
national.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
and
we
object
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
well,
yes,
we've
changed
it
but
in
substance.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
bromley
and
it
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
objections
and
suggestions
with
respect
to
the
proposed
findings.
mr.
bruce
bromley
then
on
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
--
page
1046,
we
--
we
said
that
it
was
error
to
deny
us
the
right
to
be
heard.
we
started
off
by
saying,
in
the
middle
on
the
page
under
a,
the
question
of
purging
a
patent
misuse
necessarily
involves
a
factual
inquiry
in
these
circumstances,
and
the
opinion
has
overlooked
this
principle,
and
we
want
to
be
heard.
now,
that's
the
first
one.
mr.
bruce
bromley
no.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
bromley
that's
the
brief
below.
mr.
bruce
bromley
brief
below,
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
bromley
now,
secondly,
record
1161,
item
number
2,
here,
again,
we
were
making
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
as
appears
on
1160.
and
we
specified
the
grounds.
and
then
item
number
2
of
1161,
the
court
erred
in
ruling
without
the
taking
of
any
evidence
that
usg
has
not
purged
its
patent
misuse.
and
on
1170,
once
again,
in
a
--
in
points
and
authorities
in
support
of
our
motion
which,
under
the
district
court
rules,
we
have
to
follow,
we
say
the
court
erred
in
ruling
without
the
taking
of
any
evidence
that
we've
not
purged,
and
we
again
assert
that
we
--
that
we
were
denied
the
right
to
be
heard
at
the
bottom
of
page
1170.
mr.
bruce
bromley
what?
mr.
bruce
bromley
five.
what?
mr.
bruce
bromley
no,
sir,
there
--
there's
another
reference
at
page
1252
and
1253.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
sir.
now,
i'll
--
i'll
go
forward
and
--
and
advance
it
before
the
opinion
came
down,
not
only
did
we
raise
this
issue
in
our
pleadings,
that
is
denial
to
the
allegations
against
us,
but
in
the
preliminary
hearing
of
june
9,
1953
that
preceded
all
of
this
argument
and
--
at
which
judge
stevens
presided
and
of
course,
the
court
changed
thereafter
so
we
had
three
judges
thereafter.
we've
never
heard
of
this
case.
but
when
this
--
when
these
petitions
were
filed,
judge
stevens
and
his
brother
were
still
there
and
we
had
a
hearing
--
discussion
beginning
at
record
673
and
lasting
over
to
709.
and
in
--
in
that
connection,
the
ground
rules
were
laid
down,
i
submit,
that
it
was
made
perfectly
clear
and
made
clear
by
judge
rosenman
himself
that
the
court
was
to
approach
the
matter
to
see
if
it
could
be
decided
as
a
matter
of
law
and
then
we
were
to
be
given
a
hearing
if
it
felt
it
couldn't
because
on
page
676
of
the
record,
if
you
please,
judge
rosenman
said
this
to
the
court
at
the
very
outset
before
we'd
had
any
discussion,
"we
brought
this
petition,
sirs,
in
two
claims."
one,
concern
solely
a
question
of
law,
which
i've
just
stated
and
if
your
honors
agree
with
our
contention
under
claim
number
one
of
our
petition,
there
would
be
no
need
for
going
into
claim
two.
claim
number
two
is
based
upon
a
misuse
of
the
patents
and
upon
a
contention
that
the
conduct
of
usg
has
precluded
it
from
bringing
any
action
for
royalties.
under
claim
number
two,
there
will
be
questions
of
fact
perhaps.
now,
he
says
"perhaps".
he
explains
on
the
next
page,
678,
what
he
means
by
"perhaps".
we
haven't
answered
yet.
and
he
said,
of
course,
if
we
answer,
then
there
will
be
questions
of
fact
because
judge
stevens,
on
page
678
of
the
record,
said
to
him,
"in
determining
these
questions
of
fact,
will
there
be
witnesses
or
documentary
evidence
or
what?"
and
judge
rosenman's
answer
said
that
that
would
depend
upon
whether
we
deny
the
alleged
misuse
in
the
1948-1951
period
set
forth
in
paragraph
(21)
of
the
national
petition.
i
--
i
think
he
conceded
that
if
we
denied
it,
there
would
be
questions
of
fact
upon
which
testimony
went
farther.
and
of
course,
we
did
deny
it.
now,
one
final
question
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
is
that
all,
sir?
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
bromley
in
the
--
in
the
answer,
sir,
i
think
we
did
that
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
and
in
these
documents,
that
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
--
that
answer
is
at
6
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
i
submit
we
did
that
in
our
answer,
sir,
and
in
our
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
in
our
repeated
statements
before
the
court.
mr.
bruce
bromley
we
did
not
put
it
in
a
form
of
an
offer
of
proof
because
there
was
no
evidence
against
us.
mr.
bruce
bromley
all
right.
mr.
bruce
bromley
only
in
the
record
references
to
which
--
which
i
have
given
your
honors.
mr.
bruce
bromley
to
me,
they
do,
sir.
mr.
bruce
bromley
but
at
least
they
are
all.
may
i
say
one
thing
to
--
to
mr.
justice
harlan?
i
said
yesterday,
mr.
justice
harlan,
you
read
the
wrong
opinion.
that
wasn't
so.
i
want
to
make
it
clear.
there
was
not
a
second
opinion
below
changing
what
was
there
stated
with
respect
to
the
newark
and
ebsary
suits,
but
when
the
court
below
entered
its
findings
in
decree
on
december
9,
1954,
it
ignored
and
deviated
from
what
it
said
in
that
opinion
and
enjoined
the
suits
in
toto.
