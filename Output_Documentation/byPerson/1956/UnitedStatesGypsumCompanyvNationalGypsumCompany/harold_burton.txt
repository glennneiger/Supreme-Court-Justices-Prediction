justice
harold
burton
you
said
stayed,
mr.
bromley,
stayed
by
the
trial
court
in
iowa
or
stayed
--
justice
harold
burton
yes,
sir.
justice
harold
burton
--
by
the
court
here?
justice
harold
burton
did
this
suit
ask
for
an
amendment
of
the
old
judgment
(inaudible)
justice
harold
burton
well,
that's
just
a
little
different
from
what
i
asked.
did
they
undertake
to
amend
the
former
final
judgment
of
the
antitrust
suit?
justice
harold
burton
(voice
overlap)
to
say
--
justice
harold
burton
had
the
district
court
retained
jurisdiction
for
any
enforcement
under
the
decree
of
any
--
justice
harold
burton
did
i
--
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
this
court
had
held
this
practice
were
invalid?
justice
harold
burton
the
license
agreement?
justice
harold
burton
then
we're
to
assume
that
they
are
the
--
of
course,
there
are
valid
patents
under
that
statement.
justice
harold
burton
at
least
they
haven't
been
--
justice
harold
burton
--
they
haven't
been
declared
invalid.
justice
harold
burton
in
this
case?
justice
harold
burton
how
--
how
did
they
misuse
the
patents?
justice
harold
burton
i
understand
that
the
license
agreement
--
justice
harold
burton
(voice
overlap)
invalid
and
improperly
brought
together.
justice
harold
burton
but
that
was
in
the
--
they
could
have
licensed
those
patents
prior
to
the
decision
of
this
court.
justice
harold
burton
yes.
justice
harold
burton
well,
maybe
you
could
recover
for
that
improper
payment.
if
that
isn't
here,
what
they're
doing
now
is
--
is
suing
you
in
the
other
courts
or
you're
--
for
the
quantum
meruit
on
what
was
the
use
of
--
worth
of
the
use
of
those
patents
to
you
outside
of
the
agreements.
justice
harold
burton
now
--
justice
harold
burton
--
what
is
it
--
what
is
it
makes
such
a
quantum
meruit
suit
invalid?
justice
harold
burton
what
period
of
time
does
14
cover?
justice
harold
burton
well
--
justice
harold
burton
1948
to
1951.
justice
harold
burton
what
you're
--
what
you
are
arguing
here,
judge
rosenman,
is
it
not
that
if
there
has
been
an
improper
use
of
patent
--
justice
harold
burton
--
that
then
you
can't
recover
on
a
quantum
meruit
that
he
used
of
those
patents?
justice
harold
burton
(inaudible)
justice
harold
burton
but
it
was
you're
part
of
the
u.s.
versus
u.s.
gypsum
case?
justice
harold
burton
one
of
the
parties?
justice
harold
burton
whatever
wrong
there
was
your
client
was
involved
in
it.
justice
harold
burton
and
yet
they
would
get
the
use
free.
