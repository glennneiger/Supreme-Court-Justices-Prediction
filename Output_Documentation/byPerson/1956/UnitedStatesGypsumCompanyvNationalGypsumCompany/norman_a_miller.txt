mr.
norman
a.
miller
may
it
please
the
court.
certain-teed,
like
national
gypsum,
was
a
petitioner
in
the
district
court
and
is
an
appellee
here.
we
filed
a
separate
brief
in
this
court
but
the
position
of
certain-teed
on
this
appeal
is
in
all
respects
the
same
as
national.
we
agreed
to
the
use
of
all
but
a
few
minutes
of
the
time
by
judge
rosenman
who
would
present
the
views
of
national
which
naturally
because
of
our
position
as
licensees
of
usg
also
defendants
originally,
petitioners
below
and
appellees
here
is
the
same.
there'd
be
no
purpose
served
in
my
repeating
the
matters
which
judge
rosenman
has
presented
in
his
argument
and
which
are
fully
covered
in
the
briefs
filed
by
certain-teed
and
national.
however,
i'd
like
to
devote
a
few
minutes
i
have
to
emphasizing
the
following
points.
the
first
have
to
do
with
the
reference
of
mr.
bromley
to
the
fact
that
all
that
we
had
below
was
two
days
of
argument.
now,
in
examination
of
the
district
court's
opinion
of
july
1954,
which
was
entered
a
month
and
something,
a
year
and
three
months
after
the
first
petition
had
been
filed
in
that
court
and
after
lengthy
argument
after
many
briefs
had
been
filed
would
indicate
quite
clearly
that
the
district
court
had
made
a
painstaking
examination
of
the
whole
antitrust
litigation
and
the
record
in
those
cases,
and
a
voluminous
record
it
was,
had
made
an
examination
of
the
numerous
authority
cited
to
it,
had
listened
to
all
the
arguments,
and
had
passed
upon
the
matters
presented
to
it.
again,
it
did
that
similar
thing
in
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
for
rehearing
so
that
it
would
seem
that
the
--
the
statement
that
all
that
mr.
bromley's
client
had
was
two
days
of
argument
would
be
refuted
by
the
facts.
now,
nowhere
during
all
of
that
time
did
mr.
bromley,
on
behalf
of
his
client,
make
any
proffer
of
the
various
matters
he
offered
to
prove
which
brings
me
to
the
next
point
and
that
is
that
letter
of
july
8,
1941.
the
letter
first
came
into
this
--
the
hearing
before
the
district
court
as
result
of
the
five
so-called
facts
of
purge
urged
by
mr.
bromley.
he
referred
to
the
facts
that
there
has
been
a
finding
that
they
had
ceased
fixing
prices
in
july
8,
1941
but
had
failed
inadvertently,
i
assume,
to
the
reach
--
to
say
that
that
same
letter
or
that
same
notice
had
contained
this
reservation
that
they
retain
the
right
to
fix
the
prices
at
any
time
they
desire.
in
the
district
court,
no
argument
was
ever
made
by
mr.
bromley
in
reply
to
our
reference
to
that
letter
and
that
reservation
of
right.
in
fact,
his
argument
before
the
district
court
shows
clearly
that
he
admitted
it
but
said
that
as
a
matter
of
law
that
reservation
didn't
change
their
position.
now,
with
regard
to
mr.
dallstream's
statement,
i
believe
judge
rosenman
has
answered
that
completely
except
for
one
--
one
point
which
i
wish
to
point
out.
the
fact
that
lawyer
has
said
great
many
things
before
the
decree
was
entered
wouldn't
affect
the
determination
by
this
court
of
what
the
decree
meant
and
by
the
district
court
of
what
its
own
decree
meant.
however,
as
the
footnotes
in
our
brief
and
in
mr.
--
and
in
national's
brief
at
pages
48
and
49
and
50,
respectively,
show
mr.
dallstream
specifically
stated
there
were
differences
of
opinion
between
counsel
for
the
various
petitioners
and
licensees
and
that
he
spoke
for
himself
and
that's
also
evidenced
by
mr.
bromley's
quotation
from
what
mr.
dallstream
had
to
say
when
he
said
that
in
order
that
usg
will
have
no
misunderstanding
of
my
position
that
my
suggestion
is
in
no
way
based
on
the
desire
or
hope
on
my
part
to
avoid
these
royalty
payments.
finally,
i
would
like
to
say
that
it
is
not
true
and
mr.
bromley
intimated
that
the
government
said
as
to
counts
iii,
iv
&
v,
it
was
a
private
affair
between
private
parties.
therefore,
the
government's
petition
in
its
brief
clearly
showed
that
it
considered
this
matter
of
great
interest
that
it
felt
as
to
counts
i
and
ii,
the
--
and
the
suits
filed
by
usg
that
they
were
applauding
of
this
court's
decree
and
though
they
took
no
position,
they
never
made
any
further
statement.
and
i
just
wish
to
add
finally
that
in
this
court,
the
government's
position
has
changed
to
refute
that
remark
completely,
and
i
think
it's
a
fair
statement
to
say
that
the
government
is
now
neutral
on
our
side.
