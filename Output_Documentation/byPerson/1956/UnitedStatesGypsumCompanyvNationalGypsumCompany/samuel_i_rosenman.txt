mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
if
the
court
please.
before
today,
this
case
involving
this
complicated
gypsum
industry
has
been
before
this
court
five
times.
twice,
your
honors
have
written
lengthy
opinions
discussing
the
evidence
which
was
proven
by
the
government
below.
three
times,
you
have
either
denied
reargument
or
you
have
issued
interim
injunctions
against
u.s.
gypsum.
and
in
each
of
those
five
times,
your
honors
have
founded
your
action
upon
a
finding
that
the
misuse
in
this
case
by
usg
was
of
a
most
perversive
and
pervasive
character.
the
misuse
in
this
case
involved
the
use
of
identical
patents
licenses
--
identical
patent
licenses,
which,
starting
in
1925,
u.s.
gypsum
used,
as
this
court
has
said,
to
organize
an
entire
industry
to
fix
prices,
to
limit
production,
to
regiment
the
industry,
and
to
stabilize
prices
throughout
it.
that
was
the
misuse,
your
honors,
which
forms
the
basis
of
what
the
court
below
did
in
this
case.
it
was
not
the
misuse
of
bringing
this
cause
of
action,
as
judge
bromley
would
have
you
believe.
that
was
one
of
the
grounds
to
answer
mr.
justice
brennan
on
which
the
court
below
founded
its
modification
of
the
decree,
but
it
was
only
one
and
there
were
four
others
which
i
proposed
to
take
up
with
your
honors
in
the
course
of
my
argument.
but
underlying
it
all
was
what
your
honors
found
in
two
lengthy
opinions
about
what
usg
had
done
to
this
industry.
so
that
it
must
come
as
a
shock
to
your
honors
to
learn
that
after
these
eight
years
and
after
five
occasions
of
passing
on
this
and
after
two
lengthy
opinions
in
which
your
honors
condemned
what
had
happened
in
this
industry
and
in
which
your
honors
approved
of
finding
below
that
these
license
agreements
were
illegal,
null
and
void
and
that
these
patents
had
been
misused
pervasively
through
the
industry.
i
repeat,
it
must
come
as
a
shock
to
learn
that
in
spite
of
that,
usg
in
the
district
court
of
iowa,
in
the
district
court
of
new
jersey
and
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
has
commenced
actions
for
royalties
based
upon
those
very
agreements
which
your
honors
have
held
to
be
illegal,
null
and
void.
and
two
of
the
counts
are
expressly
braced
--
based
on
it.
the
other
three
accounts,
as
we
shall
show,
are
means
of
circumventing
the
finding
of
the
illegality,
null
and
void
and
substituting
for
them,
causes
of
action,
one
of
which
the
court
below
referred
to
as
a
left-handed
way
of
getting
royalties
by
changing
the
form
of
action
without
changing
the
substance
of
the
allegation.
now,
judge
bromley
has
neglected
in
his
argument
to
discuss
something
which
is
raised
in
his
brief
and
discussed
at
great
length
in
the
brief
here
and
in
the
brief
below,
namely,
the
question
of
jurisdiction
of
this
district
court
to
do
what
it
did.
i
cannot
assume
that
that
means
that
judge
bromley
has
abandoned
that
point.
and
therefore,
i
would
like
to
take
a
few
minutes
to
sustain
the
jurisdiction
of
what
the
court
below
did.
his
--
the
jurisdiction
of
the
three-judge
court
below,
when
we
filed
our
petition,
was
challenged
and
usg
took
the
position
that
the
district
court,
in
1953,
when
we
filed
our
petitions,
had
no
jurisdiction
to
consider
these
matters
at
all
that
the
court
should
leave
it,
that
the
court
below
should
have
left
it
to
the
various
district
courts
throughout
the
united
states
to
pass
upon
the
questions
raised
by
us
in
the
petition
and
which
were
also
raised
as
defenses
in
iowa
and
in
new
jersey
and
in
new
york.
on
that
question
of
jurisdiction,
the
government
of
the
united
states
also
filed
a
petition
below
urging
the
district
court
below
to
take
some
action
with
respect
to
the
petition.
it
took
the
position
there,
and
it
takes
the
position
here
very
clearly
in
what
has
been
filed
with
your
honors
that
the
court
below
had
jurisdiction.
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said,
“isn't
it
the
court
most
probable
to
have
jurisdiction?
it
was
its
decree."
we
were
asking
this
court
to
construe
the
decree.
we
were
asking
the
court
to
enforce
the
decree,
and
we
were
asking
the
court
to
modify
the
decree,
so
which
court
would
have
better
jurisdiction
or
more
probable
jurisdiction
than
the
district
court
whose
decree
it
was?
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
yes,
sir.
that
is
the
first
point
that
we
raised
in
our
jurisdictional
question.
article
x
of
the
decree,
your
honor,
which
is
set
forth
at
record
571,
could
not
be
clearer
in
terms
nor
could
it
be
clearer
in
intendment.
that
final
decree
says
that
jurisdiction
of
this
cause
and
of
the
parties
hereto
is
retained
by
the
court
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
any
of
the
parties
to
this
decree.
to
apply
to
this
court
at
any
time
for
such
orders,
modifications,
vacations
or
directions
as
maybe
necessary
or
appropriate,
one,
for
the
construction
or
carrying
out
of
this
decree,
which
is
what
we
asked
for,
and
two,
for
the
enforcement
of
compliance
therewith
which
is
what
we
asked
for.
in
addition
to
this
specific
retention
of
jurisdiction,
we
rely
upon
the
fact
that
any
court
of
equity
has
inherent
within
it
the
power
to
do
what
this
court
did.
what
did
it
do?
the
first
thing
it
did
was
to
say
that
by
reason
of
count
i
and
ii,
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
count
i
and
ii
applies
directly
in
the
phase
of
this
decree,
we
will
bar
them.
now,
that
was
a
simple
statement
by
the
court
that
we're
going
to
protect
our
own
decree
from
having
it
nullified
out
in
iowa.
the
second
thing
it
did
was
to
modify
the
decree,
which
is
what
we
asked
for.
it
modified
the
decree,
not
only
relying
upon
article
x
but
relying
upon
its
inherent
power
to
do
so.
it
did
it
in
order
to
effectuate
what
it
considered
to
be
the
basic
purpose
of
the
decree.
and
here,
i'm
discussing
your
honors
only
the
power
of
the
court
below.
i
hope
to
have
the
opportunity
of
discussing
the
merits
of
what
the
court
did
in
some
greater
detail.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
i
say
that
it
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
i
and
ii
was
founded
completely
on
the
fact
that
it
applies
directly
in
the
phase
of
the
declaration
of
illegality
of
the
license
agreements
and
therefore
are
barred
ipso
facto.
the
government
took
the
same
position,
and
i'm
sure
that
usg
must
recognize
the
same
position.
now,
i'm
not
talking
about
the
point
of
misuse
by
bringing
the
counts.
the
court
below
went
further
and
said
that
bringing
those
counts
does
constitute
what
we
call
a
fresh
misuse
which
occurred
in
1953.
that
is
one
of
the
grounds,
but
only
one
on
which
the
court
based
its
modification.
the
more
important
misuse
and
the
one
which
i
shall
try
to
expound
to
your
honors
and
the
one
which
we
say
the
decree
and
the
conclusions
by
a
very
reading
of
them
will
show
actuated
and
activated
the
court
below
to
do
what
it
did
was
not
this
fresh
misuse.
but
the
misuse
which
your
honors
had
twice
found
pervaded
this
entire
industry
and
had
been
used
by
in
the
way
of
identical
patent
licenses
by
usg
to
regiment,
organize
the
industry
and
restrain
production.
the
fresh
misuse
was
only
an
additional
ground.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
that's
all
they
did
--
did
below,
your
honor.
we
think
that
it
went
further
in
this
court.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
here,
it's
asking
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
--
for
a
great
deal
more
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
--
but
in
the
court
below,
your
honor
is
perfectly
right
that
it
merely
took
the
position
that
with
respect
to
counts
i
and
ii,
we
agree
with
the
national
that
they
fly
in
the
face
of
the
illegality
declaration.
and
therefore,
as
the
government,
we
want
to
protect
our
decree
to
that
extent.
now,
there
was
another
ground
on
which
the
court
below
took
jurisdiction
which
is
very
important
in
considering
our
petition
there,
and
i
should
interrupt
to
say
that
i
speak
here
only
for
national
gypsum,
one
of
the
defendants.
mr.
miller
is
here
representing
certain-teed,
another
defendant.
in
the
court
below,
there
were
two
other
defendants
who
were
more
interested
in
the
fresh
purge
doctrine
than
we
are
because
we
took
a
license
as
soon
as
the
final
decree
was
signed,
so
that
we
are
not
being
sued
for
royalties
which
occurred
after
1951.
the
other
two
parties
who
are
now
out
of
the
litigation
did
not
take
a
license
in
1951,
and
they
continued
to
use
the
patents
until
usg
started
the
suits
in
newark
and
in
new
york.
and
therefore,
they
had
to
rely
more
on
the
fresh
abuse
doctrine
because
the
court
below
said
that
the
fresh
abuse
doctrine
of
having
brought
to
suit
in
1953
protects
these
other
two
defendants
right
up
to
1953
because
it
was
a
fresh
misuse
of
the
patents.
we
paid
our
royalties
and
have
paid
our
royalties
since
the
entry
of
the
final
decree,
so
that
with
--
we
are
particularly
interested
in
showing,
as
we
have
and
as
i
shall
demonstrate,
that
up
to
the
final
decree
of
1951,
this
misuse
on
the
part
of
usg
continue
the
unpurged,
the
old
unpurged
misuse
continued.
and
therefore,
we
are
absolved
from
paying
anything,
not
only
absolved
but
forbidden
to
pay
anything
up
to
the
entry
of
the
decree.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
the
decree
of
the
court
said
that
a
reasonable
royalty
should
be
faced
and
that
if
we
could
not
agree
on
the
reasonable
royalty,
we
should
come
back
to
the
court.
the
parties
did
agree
upon
a
reasonable
royalty
which
was
the
same
as
the
royalty
before
with
this
exception.
one,
one
of
the
misuse
items
and
one
of
the
things
which
the
court,
this
court
found
to
be
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
clause
was
that
the
1%
royalty
used
to
be
fixed
on
patented
and
unpatented
board,
gypsum
board.
this
decree
said,
“you
can't
fix
royalties
anymore
on
unpatented
board.
that's
a
repression
of
production,
and
we
won't
let
you
do
that
anymore.”
so
that
while
the
rate
of
royalty
was
the
same,
the
amount
of
royalty
necessarily
had
to
differ
it.
i
was
coming
to
the
additional
ground
for
jurisdiction
below
which
is
very
important
in
considering
our
petition.
four
--
four
actions
had
been
started
in
three
different
jurisdictions.
in
addition
to
that,
two
claims
had
been
made
upon
other
gypsum
companies
intimating
that
suit
was
going
to
be
brought
in
two
other
jurisdictions,
so
that
there
would
have
been
five
jurisdictions
normally
to
be
expected
which
would
be
hearing
these
claims.
so
what
the
court
did
below
was
to
take
jurisdiction
itself
on
our
petition
to
hear
as
the
original
trial
court,
the
questions
which
we
raised
in
our
petition
and
which
we
had
raised
denial,
namely,
that
there
was
a
misuse
of
these
patents
starting
way
back
in
1929.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
when
the
court
recessed
yesterday,
i
believe
i
had
completed
discussing
the
--
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
below
to
do
what
it
did
in
this
case,
the
power
of
the
court
below.
i
should
now
like
--
like
to
address
myself
to
the
merits
of
what
the
court
below
did.
the
first
thing
that
the
court
below
did
was
to
strike
down
counts
i
and
ii
of
the
iowa
suits.
we
think
that
there
--
that
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
the
proper
use
of
discretion
in
doing
that.
the
court
did
it
on
the
ground
that
those
two
counts
clearly
violate
article
iv
of
the
decree
which
had
to
judge
these
patent
licenses
to
be
illegal,
null
and
void.
and
being
illegal,
null
and
void,
the
court
said
that
you
could
not
bring
suit
upon
them.
the
court
did
not
say
as
judge
bromley
intimated
yesterday
or
said
yesterday
that
these
two
counts
were
struck
down
because
of
fresh
misuse.
they
were
not,
and
i
shall
ask
your
honors
to
look
at
the
conclusion
in
a
few
moments
with
respect
to
those
two
counts,
they
were
struck
down
not
because
they
were
brought,
they
were
struck
down
because
they
flew
directly
in
the
face
of
the
decree.
and
the
united
states
government
is
very
much
interested
in
this
and
said
below
contrary
to
what
judge
bromley
said
--
said
below
and
repeat
here
that
they
are
very
much
interested
in
protecting
the
decree
and
therefore,
they
joined
with
us
not
only
in
sustaining
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
but
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
the
patent
licenses
--
the
patent
licenses,
the
license
agreement.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
yes,
sir,
under
which
counts
i
and
ii
were
brought,
not
the
patents
--
the
patent
--
the
patent
agreements.
all
that
this
court
held
was
that
the
united
states
couldn't
contest
the
patents
if
it
wished
to
but
that
does
not
involve
in
this
appeal.
what
the
court
said
was
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
well
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
--
those
are
in
dispute.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
they
have
not.
that
is
correct,
sir.
they
have
not
been
declared
invalid.
but
the
license
agreements
have
been
declared
to
be
illegal,
null
and
void.
and
the
united
states
government
is
very
much
interested
in
protecting
its
decree
which
adjudged
these
patent
licenses,
these
patent
licenses
to
be
illegal,
null
and
void
and
did
not
take
the
position
that
they
would
not
interfere
or
intervene
in
the
case
below
because
this
was
a
private
litigation.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
there
is
no
doubt
about
that,
and
i
--
i
want
to
come
to
that
with
respect
to
the
conclusions
in
a
few
moments.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
not
only
do
i
say
so,
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
that's
right,
not
only
my
position,
that
was
the
position
of
the
court
below.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
the
court
--
the
court
below
did
the
--
took
the
same
position.
but
with
respect
to
counts
i
and
ii,
the
position
that
it
took
was
that
they
were
to
be
barred
for
reasons
of
--
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
they
had
been
specifically
barred
by
the
decree
below.
they
also
barred
them
on
other
counts,
as
i
shall
show.
now,
there
can
be
no
ambiguity
about
what
the
declaration
illegal,
null
and
void
means.
and
all
of
the
exposition
of
judge
bromley
yesterday
and
in
his
brief
talking
about
what
the
lawyers
claimed
when
--
before
the
decree
was
finally
signed,
what
illegal,
null
and
void
meant
is
entirely
beside
the
point.
this
was
not
a
consent
decree.
this
was
a
litigated
decree.
and
every
lawyer
there
was
speaking
for
his
own
client.
dallstream
was
talking
for
his
client
celotex
who
isn't
here
before
the
court.
mr.
finck
was
talking
for
national
gypsum.
and
what
these
lawyers
said
about
what
was
going
to
be
in
the
decree
was
something
which
the
court
listened
to
and
then
made
up
its
own
mind
what
was
going
to
be
put
into
the
decree
and
what
the
court
put
into
the
decree
was
that
language
that
each
and
every
one
of
these
patent
licenses
is
illegal,
null
and
void.
there
can
be
nothing
less
ambiguous
than
that
declaration,
and
usg
is
hard
put
to
it
toward
to
explain
it.
in
the
court
below
and
in
fact,
during
the
entire
course
of
this
original
litigation
through
the
various
courts,
it
took
the
position
that
these
patent
license
agreements
were
perfectly
legal
each
in
itself.
and
what
they
said
was
that
all
that
this
court
had
determined
was
that
the
plurality
of
the
licenses,
the
fact
that
there
were
so
many
is
what
made
them
illegal.
that
isn't
what
this
court
said.
it
isn't
what
the
district
court
said
originally,
and
it
isn't
what
the
district
court
says
now.
it
said
that
every
one
of
this
was
illegal.
now,
in
the
court
below,
as
i
say,
judge
bromley
made
the
argument
that
they
were
legal.
and
in
page
78
of
our
brief,
we
quote
him
as
to
what
he
said
below.
in
the
footnote,
in
the
brief
answering
the
petitioner's
briefs,
he
said
that
each
individual
license
agreement
in
this
case
constituted
a
valid
and
binding
contract.
that
was
his
position
below.
obviously,
he
doesn't
make
the
same
flat
assertion
here
but
what
he
has
tried
to
argue
yesterday
that
all
illegal,
null
and
void
meant
was
that
the
license
agreements
were
going
to
be
canceled.
now,
it's
quite
clear
that
illegal,
null
and
void
does
not
mean
that
sometime
in
the
future
we're
going
to
cancel.
they
mean
illegal,
null
and
void,
and
i
might
add
that
it
wasn't
until
the
reply
brief
in
this
case
that
usg
shifted
its
ground
from
the
saying
that
each
of
them
was
illegal
and
shifted
its
ground
to
say
that
all
they
meant
was
that
they
were
to
be
canceled.
so
i
think
we
need
not
carry
much
longer
on
counts
i
and
ii.
when
we
come
to
counts
iii,
iv
and
v,
judge
bromley
advances
a
novel
proposition.
count
iii
was
described
by
the
court
below
as
an
indebitatus
assumpsit
count,
count
iv
was
a
quantum
meruit,
and
count
v
is
the
action
for
infringement.
now,
what
did
the
court
below
do
with
respect
to
these
counts?
it
definitely
and
unequivocally
barred
them
all.
it
barred
them
on
three
separate
grounds,
not
on
one
ground,
as
judge
bromley
what
had
you
--
have
you
believed.
it
barred
them
on
three
separate
grounds.
each
one
was
an
alternative
ground,
each
one,
we
maintain,
was
a
proper
ground,
and
each
one
was
sufficient
on
which
they
found
its
conclusion
that
these
iowa
suits
should
be
barred.
now,
judge
bromley
in
his
argument
yesterday,
as
i
say,
advanced
this
proposition,
which
he
has
never
advanced
before
to
the
effect,
and
i
quote
him
on
page
14
in
response
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question.
justice
brennan,
"did
it
have
any
other
basis
than
this
ground,
that
is
the
fresh
misuse
involved
in
bringing
the
iowa
action?"
mr.
bromley,
"i
think
--
i
don't
think
it
did.
i
think
it
asserted
that
some
of
the
allegations
of
misuse
had
been
proved
although
they
had
not
been."
there
is
a
conflict,
i
think,
and
a
little
doubt
as
to
what
they
did
decide.
but
my
position
is
all
they
decided,
as
a
matter
of
law,
was
the
bringing
of
the
suit
was
enough.
justice
frankfurter
at
that
point
said
--
i'm
sorry,
i
withdraw
that.
on
page
30,
he
was
even
more
unequivocal
than
that.
what
he
said
was,
"now,
therefore,
it
is
clear
from
conclusions
7
and
13
of
the
court
below,
which
appear
at
record
1156,
conclusions
7
and
13,
if,
in
1953,
we
had
not
pleaded
counts
on
the
old
licenses
--
on
the
old
license
agreement,
the
1951
decree,"
i
think
he
meant
1954
decree,
"would
not
have
barred
compensation
suits
based
on
the
other
counts".
that
is
the
second
paragraph
of
the
conclusion
7."
if
we
had
not
pleaded
those
counts,
then
the
court,
as
it
did,
would
hold
that
the
other
counts
were
not
barred
by
the
decree.
i
further
think
it
is
clear
that
if
we
had
not
pleaded
those
counts,
we
would
not
have
been
deemed
to
have
misused
our
patents
from
1948
to
1953,"
referring
again
to
the
same
record.
and
finally,
"if
we
had
not
pleaded
those
counts,
i
think
it
is
clear
from
those
conclusions,
the
court
would
not
have
modified
the
final
decree."
at
which
point,
justice
frankfurter
said,
"it
strikes
me
a
strange."
and
it
also
strikes
us
a
strange
because
it
just
isn't
true.
that
is
not
true
as
to
what
the
court
did.
it
involves
a
misconception
of
what
the
court
below
did
of
so
fundamental
in
nature
that
i
would
ask
your
honors'
indulgence
to
turn
to
the
conclusions
of
law
in
this
case
which
we
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
in
this
case,
in
this
record,
what
the
court
below
decided
and
the
conclusions
of
law
begin
at
page
1155
of
the
record,
the
second
volume.
there
are
16
conclusions
of
law,
as
your
honors
will
see
beginning
on
page
1155.
the
first
10
of
them
have
to
do
mainly
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
below
and
with
counts
i
and
ii.
the
final
six
of
them
beginning
with
number
11,
set
forth
the
basis
of
the
court's
decision
below.
may
i
respectfully
direct
your
attention
to
number
11
in
which
the
court
said
that
the
course
of
conduct
of
usg
has
clearly
shown
by
the
proceedings
of
record
in
the
antitrust
case,
that's
the
case
in
which
your
honors
passed
on
twice.
and
then
these
suits
by
usg
established
that
usg
did
not
purge
itself
of
its
patent
misuse
at
any
time
prior
to
may
15th,
1951.
now,
that
was
the
date
of
the
decree
so
that
the
court
here
was
talking
about
the
prior
misuse,
which
was
the
basis
of
the
1951
decree,
the
unpurged
misuse.
it
wasn't
talking
about
the
misuse
which
had
alleged
occurred
when
the
iowa
suits
were
brought.
and
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
the
acts
--
the
five
acts
claimed
by
usg
to
constitute
acts
of
purge
prior
to
may
15th
do
not
constitute
purge.
now,
whenever
they
talk
about
purge,
they
are
talking
about
the
old
misuse.
they
couldn't
be
talking
about
purge,
as
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out
yesterday
with
respect
to
the
new
actions
because
obviously,
there's
no
purge
there.
those
actions
are
still
pending.
there
need
be
no
evidence
about
that
so
that
whenever
the
court
below
was
talking
about
purge
and
misuse
prior
to
may
15th,
1951,
they
were
unquestionably
talking
about
the
misuse
which
this
court
found
in
two
opinions
to
pervade
this
entire
industry
by
misuse
of
the
patents.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
i
--
i
was
coming
to
that,
your
honor,
but
i
--
i
was
perkily
willing
to
answer
your
honor's
question
now.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
judge
bromley
yesterday
said
that
the
record
was
closed
to
1941
and
there
could
be
no
possible
claim
of
misuse
between
1941
and
1951.
your
honors
will
recall
that
so
far
as
my
client
and
the
other
defendant
here,
certain-teed,
our
concern,
we
are
only
concerned
with
misuse
up
to
1951.
now,
this
court
had
found
that
speaking
in
1948,
in
its
first
opinion,
that
there
was
vast
pervasive
misuse
in
this
industry.
it
is
true,
as
judge
bromley
said
and
as
the
brief
said,
they
were
talking
as
of
1941
when
the
evidence
was
closed.
now,
we
say
that
this
misuse
continued
until
1951,
first,
because
of
the
presumption
that
this
misuse
will
continue
unless
it's
shown
to
have
been
purged
that
was
--
that's
what
this
case
has
held
many
times
particularly
in
the
b.b.
chemical
case
that
once
the
misuse
is
shown,
it
is
not
dissipated
until
it
is
shown
to
have
been
terminated
and
the
evil
effects
dissipated,
not
until
then
is
a
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
it
must
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
the
showing
would
have
to
be
if
--
if
anything
were
alleged
to
show
a
purge.
the
showing
would
have
to
be
in
the
court
below.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
in
this
case,
yes,
sir.
and
that's
what
this
court
held,
"instead
of
showing
it
in
iowa,
let's
show
it
here.
mr.
usg,
will
you
show
it
here
where
all
the
parties
are
involved
where
we
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
i'm
coming
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
and
the
reason
they
weren't
allowed
to
show
it
is
that
they
proffered
nothing
to
be
shown.
i
--
i
will
come
to
that.
the
answer
--
the
second
--
the
second
part
of
the
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
is
that
we
do
not
have
to
rely
entirely
upon
the
continuance
of
this
misuse
which
was
clearly
found
by
this
court
because
it
is
clear
from
this
record,
and
it
cannot
be
disputed
by
any
kind
of
a
hearing,
that
this
misuse
continued
until
1948
for
the
following
reason.
we
--
they
collected
royalties
from
us
right
up
until
the
time
when
this
court
told
us
that
it
would
be
illegal
to
pay
royalties.
they
collected
royalties
from
us
on
their
license
agreement.
this
license
agreement
was
at
--
in
at
least
two
respects,
unlawful.
and
these
unlawful
license
agreements
misused
their
patents
right
up
until
1948
when
we
made
our
last
payment.
but
why
would
they
be
unlawful?
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
because
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
--
they
misused
the
patents
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
they
misused
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
by
a
lawful
license,
yes,
sir.
and
a
lawful
license
of
those
patents
would
not
have
been
a
misuse
of
the
patents
but
they
licensed
those
patents
by
an
agreement
which
contained
these
two
elements
of
illegality
apart
from
anything
else.
the
first
thing
that
was
illegal
was
that
it
fixed
prices,
it
fixed
the
resale
price.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
the
second
thing
that
was
illegal
was
that
it
demanded
and
collected
royalties
on
unpatented
as
well
as
patented
products.
this
court
has
held
that
both
of
those
collections,
both
of
those
exceptions
are
illegal,
and
it
is
our
contention
that
they
collected
royalties
right
down
until
1948,
right
down
until
this
court
spoke
on
a
patent
agreement
which
was
so
unlawful
that
it
ipso
facto
constituted
a
misuse
of
the
patents.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
i'm
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
i
was
answering
the
question.
i
will
--
i
will
come
to
that,
sir.
i
was
answering
the
question
of
mr.
justice
harlan
and,
i
believe,
your
honor's
own
question
as
to
what
there
was
up
to
1948
which
was
a
misuse
of
the
patents,
and
i
say
that
what
misuse
of
the
patents
was
a
collection
year
by
year
from
1941,
a
month-by-month
from
1941
right
down
until
march
1948.
every
month,
they
collected
royalties
from
us
under
a
license
agreement
which
was
so
illegal
that
it
constituted
a
misuse
of
the
patents,
and
this
court
said
so.
this
court
said
that
you
couldn't
collect
--
you
couldn't
collect
on
unpatented
products
that
extended
the
monopoly
of
the
patent.
this
court
had
said
that
a
number
of
times,
so
that
when
--
when
they
forced
us
to
pay
royalties,
1942,
1943,
1944
or
1945,
right
down
to
march
1948,
when
this
court
--
when
this
court
struck
it
all
down,
they
were
exacting
royalties
from
us
under
license
agreements
which
were
illegal.
that
has
been
held
time
and
again
to
constitute
a
misuse
of
the
patents,
and
that
is
my
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan
asking
me
what
there
was
in
the
record
which
constituted
misuse
after
1941.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
up
to
1948,
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
that's
right.
you're
right.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
the
evidence,
sir,
is
that
in
1948,
this
abuse,
this
misuse
continued.
we
rely
upon
the
presumption
in
the
absence
of
a
showing
to
the
contrary
that
said
whatever
misuse
this
court
found
continued.
and
the
cases
hold,
sir,
that
we
are
entitled
to
rely
on
that
presumption.
and
this
court
had
said
time
and
again
that
the
misuse
of
patents
prevents
the
recovery
upon
them
until
two
things
happened.
one,
that
the
misuse
has
terminated,
and
two,
that
the
evil
effects
of
the
misuse
have
been
dissipated.
now,
we
said
below,
"mr.
u.s.
gypsum,
the
burden
is
now
upon
you.
this
court
has
held
in
two
lengthy
opinions
that
you
misused
these
--
these
patents.
the
burden
upon
you
is
now
to
bring
yourself
within
the
b.b.
chemical
case
which
says,
'you
must
now
proceed
to
show,
you
must
now
proceed
to
show
that
your
misuse
has
terminated
as
one
thing,
not
only
terminated
but
been
abandoned
which
is
much
more
than
terminated
as
b.b.
chemical
said.
you
must
now
show.
you
have
the
burden
of
showing
that
your
misuse
has
been
abandoned
and
two,
that
the
evil
effects
of
that
misuse
have
been
terminated."
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
now,
we
show,
sir
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
now,
they
didn't
offer
to
do
it,
sir.
and
in
answer
to
justice
frankfurter's
question,
judge
bromley
admitted
that
we
proffered
nothing
there
because
they
took
the
position
that
we,
the
defendant,
would
have
to
go
ahead
and
not
only
--
not
only
reprove
all
of
the
misuse
but
we
would
have
to
prove
that
there
was
no
purge.
now,
the
cases
are
to
the
contrary,
the
cases
are
that
the
misuse
was
found
by
this
court
and
until
that
misuse
is
abandoned
and
that
the
evil
effects
dissipated
and
they
have
the
burden
to
showing
it,
they
cannot
recover
on
those
patents.
now
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
no,
sir.
our
--
our
result
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
the
issue
would
be
the
same
for
the
following
reason.
what
this
court
found
was
not
merely,
not
merely
those
two
items
of
misuse
which
i
referred
to,
which
continued
until
1948
clearly,
this
court
found
at
least
five
other
items
of
misuse,
at
least
three
other
items
of
misuse.
one
was
that
jobbers
were
eliminated.
secondly,
that
the
prices
of
unpatent
products
--
unpatented
products
were
fixed.
third,
that
there
were
such
a
regulation
and
regimentation
of
trade
practices
that
this
entire
industry
was
within
the
grip
of
usg.
what
were
these
trade
practices?
they
did
and
they
insisted
upon
basing
point
price
delivered
system.
they
insisted
that
stand
to
substandard
wall
board.
they
saw
that
the
same
price
as
standard.
they
insisted
that
there
be
no
commission
salesman.
and
this
court
in
its
opinions
went
right
through
the
various
items
of
misuse
and
pointed
out
how
vast
was
the
conspiracy
which
held
this
industry
in
a
regimented
form.
and
therefore,
your
honor,
to
answer
your
question,
what
must
be
shown
here
by
usg
is
not
merely
that
they
stop
fixing
prices.
they
must
show,
said
this
court
in
b.b.
chemical
and
in
morton
salt
and
in
the
long
line
of
cases,
they
must
show
that
every
item
of
misuse,
which
was
found
by
this
court,
has
been
dissipated
--
has
been
abandoned.
and
not
only
that,
but
they
must
show
after
the
abandonment
that
its
evil
effects
had
been
terminated.
it
is
our
position
that
they
could
not
possibly
show
that
the
evil
effects
of
this
conspiracy
had
been
terminated
until
the
final
decree
was
signed,
at
least
until
the
final
decree
was
signed
because
this
court
said
that
any
prior
decree
was
insufficient
to
meet
that
test
of
dissipating
the
evil
effects.
the
original
decree
of
1949
came
up
here
on
appeal
by
the
government
to
expand.
and
the
government
said,
"your
honors,
this
decree
is
not
sufficient
to
meet
the
test
in
morton
salt
and
b.b.
chemical.
we
wanted
to
expand
it.
we
want
the
evil
effects
of
this
decree
dissipated."
and
your
honors
agreed
with
them.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
if
we
--
if
--
if
the
case
holds,
sir,
i'm
not
familiar
with
that.
even
if
the
case
holds
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
if
the
case
holds
the
same
as
the
connolly
case.
we
discussed
the
connolly
case.
there,
there
was
a
case
of
a
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
that's
--
there
was
a
case
there
of
two
or
three
conspirators
and
one
of
the
conspirators
sold
some
merchandise
to
someone
outside
and
the
person
outside
defended
on
the
suit
for
purchase
price
saying
that
"we
don't
have
to
pay,
you
--
you
conspired
and
--
and
what
you
did
was
a
violation
to
antitrust
laws."
and
this
court
held
you're
right,
you're
right.
you
have
an
obligation
to
one
of
the
conspirators
and
the
fact
that
a
conspiracy
in
restrain
of
trade
took
place
outside
of
your
transaction.
it
does
not
absolve
you
from
liability.
and
in
our
brief,
we
point
out
how
clearly
that
is
distinguishable
from
this
case.
this
is
a
case
where
the
claim
for
royalties
is
so
bound
up
with
the
conspiracy.
the
katzinger
case
points
out
that
the
claim
for
royalties
is
a
part
of
a
--
of
a
price
fixing
scheme.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
if
i
did,
i
misspoke
myself.
what
i
say
was
that
even
--
even
if
they
hadn't
brought
i
and
ii
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
i
thought
i
was
saying
that
the
balance
of
the
counts
iii,
iv
and
v
would
still
be
invalid.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
the
court
below
said
that
it
does,
sir.
the
court
below
said
that
the
mere
bringing
of
counts
i
and
ii
is
what
it
called
a
“fresh
misuse”.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
i'm
sorry
if
i
did.
what
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
i'm
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
what
the
court
below
did,
and
i
was
going
through
these
conclusions,
was,
as
one
of
its
grounds,
urged
this
completely
novel
position
that
the
mere
bringing
of
the
suit
was
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
was
a
misuse
of
the
patent.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
i
do
not,
sir.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
this
--
this
is
something
which
i
--
i
wish
to
argue
but
what
i
am
now
trying
to
show
is
that
that
was
not
the
sole
basis
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
that's
right.
and
it's
my
position
and
it's
the
position
of
the
court
below
in
number
11
because
it
said
number
11,
and
i
was
in
the
midst
of
going
through
this
when
your
honors
began
to
question
it,
number
11
is
clearly
one
of
those
unpurged
misuses
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
bringing
of
the
suit.
number
12
is
to
the
same
effect.
in
view
of
the
misuse
by
usg
of
its
patents
as
a
matter
of
law
on
the
facts
here
which
has
not
been
purged.
now,
they're
talking
about
the
misuse
which
this
court
found.
they
couldn't
have
been
talking
about
this
suit
because
they
cover
the
suit
in
number
13
as
judge
bromley
said.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
yes,
sir.
it
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
--
it
means
not
because
of
the
declaration
of
illegality
or
the
old
part
that
it
--
that
--
that
is
not
so,
your
honor.
what
it
means
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
--
includes
that
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
no,
sir.
when
you
take
this
in
conjunction
with
the
opinion
and
with
the
other
findings,
what
the
court
was
saying
here
was
that
all
of
the
misuse
that
i
have
enumerated
and
that
this
court
has
enumerated
including
the
illegality
of
the
license
agreements,
but
all
of
the
misuse
that
i
have
set
forth,
all
of
that
misuse
occurred,
he
says
unpurged
up
to
1951.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
yes,
sir.
what
this
court
said
was
that
up
until
1951,
you
haven't
shown
any
purge
and
therefore,
you
cannot
recover.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
they
did
by
their
pleadings
but
they
didn't
by
anything
to
justify
the
court
below
in
granting
them
a
hearing.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
yes,
sir,
and
we
cover
that
very
--
very
carefully
in
our
brief.
we
say
that
the
court
below
should
not
have
been
put
to
the
necessity
of
having
a
hearing
on
the
question
of
purge
unless
something
was
indicated
to
them
to
indicate
to
--
to
show
what
a
hearing
was
to
be
held
about.
now,
all
that
they
did
below
was
to
say
that
there
are
some
five
facts,
which
apparently
i
do
not
have
time
to
go
into,
there
were
some
five
facts,
not
new
facts,
but
five
facts
in
the
old
record
which
we
claim
constitute
purge.
the
court
below
said
they
do
not
constitute
purge
even
if
they're
true,
even
if
you
can
prove
those
five
facts.
they
are
not
adequate
in
law
to
constitute
purge.
we
agree
with
that.
and
if
i
had
time,
i
would
discuss
each
of
these
five
facts
to
show
that
even
if
proved,
they
do
not
meet
the
test
of
purge.
so
then,
we
contend
that
it
was
up
to
usg
to
say,
"if
you
don't
think
those
constitute
purge,
then
we
have
the
following
evidence
which
we
would
like
to
submit
to
you
to
have
a
hearing
on
because
we
think
we
can
prove
purge."
now,
this
court
said
in
its
second
opinion
in
this
case
that
the
court
below
didn't
have
to
waste
its
time
that
it
could
regulate
the
procedure.
i
have
the
quote
here
at
some
place.
it
could
regulate
its
own
procedure
so
it
wouldn't
waste
time.
now,
this
is
very
much
like
a
summary
judgment
action
and
your
honors
know
that
in
the
federal
courts
as
well
as
in
the
state
court,
if
i
come
in
to
the
court
and
say,
"i
would
like
a
summary
judgment
because
i
have
a
note
and
it's
very
clear
on
its
face,
i
am
entitled
to
a
judgment
on
this
note."
now,
if
you
say,
"i've
got
some
defenses
on
this
note,
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
be
heard
on
it,"
you'd
be
left
out
of
court.
the
court
will
say,
"well,
tell
me
what
you
want
to
prove
and
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
--
i'll
determine
whether
there's
a
defense."
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
i
--
i
think,
your
honor,
that
they
have
to
be
more
than
pleading.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
certainly,
in
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
--
the
state
court,
a
pleading
isn't
enough.
there
must
be
some
affidavit
indicating
that
there
is
some
defense.
but
even
if
it's
on
the
pleadings,
at
least
the
pleadings
must
show
what
you
rely
upon
and
the
pleadings
below
didn't
show
what
judge
bromley
relies
upon.
judge
bromley
didn't
disclose
to
the
court
below
what
he
relied
on,
and
he
hasn't
disclosed
here
what
he
relies
on.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
offered
nothing,
and
he
said
so
in
answer
to
judge
--
justice
frankfurter's
question,
"what
did
you
proffer
below?"
and
he
said
nothing.
he
relied
upon
the
record.
he
also
relied
upon
the
fact
that
we
have
the
verdict,
and
he
said
so
that
he
relied
on
the
fact
that
we
have
the
burden
again
to
prove
misuse
in
spite
of
what
your
honors
said
in
two
opinions
that
we
have
the
burden
of
proving
it
and
that
we
have
the
burden
of
going
further
and
saying
you
didn't
purge
it.
now,
the
court
below
said,
following
the
b.b.
chemical
case,
"the
burden
is
on
you,
usg,
to
show
that
the
misuse
has
been
abandoned,
that
the
evil
effects
have
been
dissipated,
and
you
must
show
that.
tell
me
what
you
want
to
prove
to
show
it."
and
all
that
usg
could
say
is
that
there
are
five
facts
in
the
record
here
which
we
discussed
very
fully
in
our
brief,
which
the
court
discussed
very
fully
below
to
indicate,
to
indicate
that
there
was
no
purge.
if
i
may
just
be
permitted
to
go
through
these
conclusions
again,
number
13,
number
13
is
the
only
one.
it's
the
only
one
on
which
judge
bromley
can
rely
to
show
that
the
court
below
was
depending
upon
the
new
actions,
so
i'll
pass
that.
but
if
you
look
at
14,
when
the
court
disposes
of
count
iii,
they
don't
do
it
on
any
basis
of
new
misuse.
they
do
it
on
the
ground
that
--
that
count
is
only
a
left-handed
indirect
method
for
recovering
the
royalties
produced
about.
look
at
the
next
count
when
they
discussed
the
quantum
meruit.
they
don't
put
it
on
the
new
misuse
of
the
patents,
they
put
it
on
two
grounds.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
the
--
the
critical
period
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
1948
to
1951.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
yes,
sir.
and
what
the
court
saying
here
is,
"you've
misused
this.
the
supreme
court
has
said
so,
now
it's
up
to
you
to
show
--
it's
up
to
you
to
show
that
this
misuse
has
been
abandoned
and
the
evil
effects
dissipated
and
you
haven't
done
it."
but
my
point
here
is
this
is
not
relying
on
the
iowa
action
as
a
misuse,
it
says
the
misuse
of
the
patents
which
were
involved
in
this
antitrust
suit
as
a
matter
of
law
to
have
existed
and
not
to
have
been
purged.
that's
the
basis
for
their
throwing
out
of
count
iv,
not
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
you
can't
--
yes,
sir,
i
go
further
and
say
you
can't
recover
on
any
ground.
you
cannot
recover
for
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
--
use
or
infringement
or
any
ground.
this
court
had
said
so
time
and
again,
the
hartford-empire
case,
the
national
lead
case.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
is
now
such
a
routine
remedy,
sir.
this
is
such
a
routine
remedy.
the
remedy
that
you
cannot
sue
on
a
patent
for
use
before
the
final
decree,
decree
to
pre-period,
which
is
what
this
court
said.
this
has
become
so
routine
a
penalty,
so
routine
a
remedy
rather
that
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
in
the
vast
majority
of
consent
decrees,
this
is
now
a
part
of
the
consent
decrees.
and
in
innumerable
lower
court
cases,
it's
a
part
of
the
remedy.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
in
the
hartford-empire
case
and
in
the
national
lead
case
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
--
and
in
the
national
lead
case.
you
have
said
in
both
cases,
you
have
approved
decrees
below,
and
you've
definitely
stated
in
the
hartford-empire
case,
you
have
said,
and
i
know
that
judge
bromley
will
get
up
and
talk
about
the
receiver
in
that
case
which
is
an
entirely
unique
situation.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
in
hartford-empire,
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
sir?
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
it's
discussed
in
the
brief.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
the
quotation
is
there.
all
of
the
facts
are
set
forth
in
hartford-empire.
your
honors
held
that
where
there's
a
misuse
of
the
patents,
and
your
honors
compared
and
--
and
our
brief
compares
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
i
don't
quite
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
i
don't
quite
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
it
is
our
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
it
is
our
contention,
sir,
that
what
your
honors
said
in
the
hartford-empire
case
and
in
the
national
lead
case
and
which
lower
courts
have
said
time
and
again
is
that
the
inability
to
recover
for
infringement,
quantum
meruit
or
any
ground
runs
right
up
to
the
decree,
the
final
decree
in
the
case
because
until
that
decree
is
made,
there
can
be
no
purge.
your
honors,
i
have
agreed
to
let
--
mr.
miller
and
i
have
agreed
that
he
may
have
the
concluding
five
minutes
unless
there
are
any
questions.
i
bound
by
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
i
--
i
don't
mind.
i
just
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
it's
both,
sir.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
we
--
we
contend
that
what
they
did
put
in
issue,
namely,
these
five
facts
are,
as
a
matter
of
law,
insufficient.
and
then
we
say
they
offered
nothing
else
and
it
was
up
to
them
to
offer
something
else
if
they
want
us
--
the
court
to
give
them
a
hearing
because
unless
they
do,
there's
nothing
to
have
a
hearing
about.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
yes,
sir.
it
was
one
of
the
--
it
was
one
of
the
defendants.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
that
--
that's
not
an
unusual
remedy.
that's
not
unusual
remedy,
your
honor.
that
occurs
in
every
case
where,
as
i
say,
this
court
has
forbidden
infringement
actions
up
to
the
time
of
the
final
decree.
these
are
joint
tortfeasors
and
the
law
--
the
law
leaves
them
where
they
find
them.
and
your
honors
have
said,
particularly
your
--
could
call
your
attention
if
i
could
find
this
but
my
time
is
up.
your
honors
have
said
time
and
again
that
patent
misuse
involves
the
public
interest,
and
we
are
going
to
defend
the
public
interest.
we
don't
care
whether
this
redounds
to
the
benefit
of
any
individual.
that's
not
our
concern.
it
is
our
concern
to
see
that
this
paramount
interest
of
the
public
is
protected
against
patent
misuse
that
the
good
effects
of
the
sherman
act
are
to
be
obtained
no
matter
if
a
co-conspirator
does
get
benefit
from
it.
your
honors
have
said
that
time
and
again.
we
quote
those
in
--
in
the
brief,
and
i
think
it's
--
