justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
catch.
was
the
reference
made
to
the
iowa
suit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
the
claim
of
the
defendant's
illegality
by
virtue
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
the
proceeding
in
the
iowa
court
rest
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
stayed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
problem
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
date
between
the
--
between
the
defense
and
between
the
answer
in
the
iowa
(inaudible)
this
proceeding,
were
each
more
or
less
contemporaneous?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
you
mean
in
this
suit
in
the
district
now?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
if
it
stayed
--
if
the
proceeding
to
await
the
outcome
of
this
--
of
the
proceeding
below
not
awaiting
what
we
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
the
iowa
court
preferred
not
to
deal
with
the
merits
of
the
claim
of
illegality
as
an
answer
to
the
suit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
followed
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
amendment
of
the
decree.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
amendment
is
correct,
then
that's
a
correct
controversy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
take
a
minute
to
state
what
evidence
on
proffer
--
what
kind
of
issue
in
the
proffer
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
bringing
of
the
suit
as
an
object
in
fact
which
--
which
we
didn't
contest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
take
judicial
order
of
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
goal
--
rule
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
bringing
of
the
suit
were
to
violate
the
decree?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that's
why
the
evidence
would
be
irrelevant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
why
--
why
didn't
you
contest
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean
that
that's
--
that's
one
of
the
things
in
this
--
a
basis
of
this
modification,
is
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
government
take
any
position
on
that
issue?
it
did
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
government
take
any
position
on
the
legal
bearing
of
bringing
of
the
suits
to
your
duty
of
obedience
and
including
the
names?
justice
felix
frankfurter
moreover,
it
doesn't
say
the
government
--
that
they
don't
want
to
enter
to
the
question
of
a
quantum
meruit
controversy.
the
implication
of
that
is
it
didn't
regard
the
bringing
of
that
suit
in
and
out
itself
a
violation
of
the
decree.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me.
i
don't
want
to
take
you
out
of
your
enforcement.
i
know
it
has
well
been
charted,
but
all
you've
said
now,
these
are
(inaudible)
of
the
question,
all
you
--
the
whole
argument
up
to
this
point
concerns
the
construction
of
a
provision
of
the
decree,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that,
to
me,
is
rather
impliedly
persuasive
to
place
against
such
a
construction
is
from
the
court
to
render
the
decree.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
not
--
because
it
comes
up
later,
it
becomes
along
on
the
question
of
what
is
a
proper
form
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
a
controversy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
understood
you.
i
just
want
to
tell
you
what
the
impression
of
your
own
argument
that's
on
my
mind,
i
have
to
say.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
i
can
see
that
you
oppose
to
that.
you
say
there
are
(inaudible)
and
i
think
you
can
perform
possibility
with
what
meaning
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
hope
you
have
sometime
or
just
for
a
minute
anyway.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
all
right,
go
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
i'm
not
(inaudible)
your
argument.
i'm
(inaudible)
if
that
was
in
the
mind
of
the
court
that
to
set
up
due
course
of
action
and
what
is
bad
that
--
that
appreciates
what
otherwise
might
be
good.
that's
what
you
are
saying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
--
i'm
little
in
a
doubt.
you
said
it
came
out
of
a
brief
from
the
other
side
and
then
you
said
about
a
footnote
(inaudible)
you
lost
me
at
that
point.
that
is
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
the
footnote
to
the
brief,
there
was
a
quotation
of
one
of
your
documents?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
doesn't
that
make
any
less
of
a
document?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
--
is
that
--
is
the
full
document
of
which
that
is
the
part
anywhere
in
the
record
now
before
us?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
quoted
it
full
in
the
appellee?
justice
felix
frankfurter
judge
rosenman,
since
the
government
isn't
here
except
by
a
decree,
would
you
tell
me
if
i
am
right
in
reading
its
position
before
the
court
below
as
--
as
maintaining
the
--
the
cause
of
action,
insofar
as
the
(inaudible)
and
the
license
agreement
is
illegal
and
it's
--
and
as
such
for
violation
of
the
decree.
that's
the
scope
and
the
principle
and
the
only
scope
of
the
government,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
here,
if
you're
asking
for
some
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
would
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
--
let
me
put
what
you've
just
said
into
different
or
unequivocal
language.
you're
saying
that
even
though
the
suit
that
had
been
brought
by
the
usg
(inaudible)
had
explicitly
disavowed
any
right
under
the
--
under
the
assignment
under
the
license
and
said
they
merely
sue
for
quantum
meruit,
you
say
that
the
decree
would
have
been
just
affixed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
--
i'm
--
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
be
sure
that
i
understood
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
--
i
mean
that's
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
has
to
be
in
order
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
you
to
maintain
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
shown
--
shown
where
and
how?
shown
where
and
how?
justice
felix
frankfurter
unless,
it's
shown.
if
the
testimony
closed
as
of
1941,
where
would
the
showing
be,
from
the
course
of
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
in
this
court,
in
this
case,
you
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
were
told
--
we
were
told
you're
coming
to
that
but
they
weren't
allowed
to
show
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
--
did
your
--
would
you
clear
up
my
mind
(inaudible)
to
make
up
my
mind?
if,
in
1948,
they
had
sent
you
a
letter
saying,
hereafter,
he
merely
want
a
quantum
meruit
return
for
your
use
of
our
patent,
we
eliminate
in
1948,
this
is
a
hypothetical
case
but
not
conformed
to
what
i
understand
in
the
record,
we
eliminate
a
claim
of
price
fixing.
we
eliminate
a
claim
on
the
unpatented
articles.
we
asked
for
quantum
meruit
on
the
patent
--
for
the
use
of
the
patent.
if
that
had
been
shown,
the
situation
would
be
very
different,
would
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
issue
would
be
the
same?
justice
felix
frankfurter
judge
rosenman,
my
(inaudible)
perhaps,
but
most
of
the
times,
i
don't
read
the
briefs.
i'd
like
to
have
the
impact
of
action
but
i
don't
know
what
you
mean.
in
view
of
the
argument
that
you've
just
made,
i
wonder
if
you
could
discuss
in
your
brief
the
--
going
on
in
an
old
(inaudible)
case
in
which
this
court
held
that
although
you
got
a
seller
who
is
to
confess
monopoly
and
have
violated
the
sherman
law,
if
you
buy
goods
from
him,
you
can
or
the
defense
say,
he
has
violated
the
sherman
law.
now,
that
--
that
case
seemed
to
be
now
irrelevant
to
this
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
if
i'm
not
mistaken.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
the
--
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
your
claim
for
royalty
but
i'm
talking
--
i
assume
that
your
position
here,
you
put
on
one
side.
you
--
i
assume
from
what
you've
said
--
i'm
referring
from
what
you
said
that
the
fact
that
they
sued
in
one
of
their
accounts
or
two
of
their
accounts
in
the
iowa
suit
on
the
original
license
does
not
dispose
of
as
such
the
claim
on
quantum
meruit
that
that
is
not
a
misuse
of
the
patent.
did
--
did
i
correctly
understand
that?
you
rejected
the
--
the
suggestion
--
it
seems
to
me
strange
that
because
a
count
is
invalid
because
it
would
be
an
enforcement
of
an
invalid
license,
therefore,
that
necessarily
proves
that
a
count
for
--
on
quantum
meruit
is
bad.
you
rejected
that,
didn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand.
that's
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
fact
that
they
brought
counts
i
and
ii
doesn't
--
doesn't
dispose
of
the
other
counts.
the
fact
that
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
thought
you
--
you
rejected
that?
do
you
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
misunderstood
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
a
misuse
of
the
patent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
you
--
you
do
not
reject
that
ground.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
apart
from
that,
even
if
that
were
not
in
the
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
your
position
is
there
is
a
--
there's
an
organic
invalidity
which
--
which
continued.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
questioning
you,
judge
rosenman,
but
where
we
said
precisely
what
you
now
saying
he
says.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
questioning
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
asking
you
to
refer
me
to
the
page
in
which
i
could
find
the
(inaudible)
of
what
the
judge
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
take
your
time
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
searching
your
brief.
that
is
fine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
understand
--
i
can
understand
that
the
proper
issuing
of
law
if
you
didn't
have
the
complicating
factor
of
this
case,
namely,
that
the
fact
is
--
circumstances
may
have
entered
that
bring
a
new
time
of
it.
i'm
not
saying
it's
true
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
in
the
position
to
say
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
just
saying
is
that
--
that
if
a
decree
--
if
what
--
if
we
dealt
here
with
a
decree
directive
to
a
period
condemning
conduct
within
a
hearing
in
which
there
was
an
illegality,
i
can
well
understand
if
you'd
said,
"you
can't
get
quantum
meruit
if
you
can't
get
the
contract
price,"
even
that
is
a
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
questions
of
a
quasi
contract
that
are
not
so
clear
to
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
trouble
you
to
refer
me
to
the
doctrine
in
which
you
made
that
claim
before
the
court
below
in
which
you
asked
that
court
to
give
you
a
chance
to
approve
what
you
just
said
you
wanted.
what
is
the
doctrine?
is
it
the
answer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
it
--
what
it
--
what,
that
the
document
is
entitled
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
1046,
1047?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
after
the
opinion
as
to
the
conclusions
of
the
findings
came
down?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you?
did
both
sides
submit
proposed
findings?
and
the
government
(voice

--
justice
felix

national
submitted
the
proposed
findings.
justice

i'll
say
that
it
reflected
in
the
present
findings
that
in
substance
to
present
findings?
justice

and
you
--
you
entered
objections

to
those
findings
that
there's

and
--
justice
