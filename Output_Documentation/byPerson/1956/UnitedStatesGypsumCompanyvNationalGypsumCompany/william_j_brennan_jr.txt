justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
did
it
have
any
other
basis
--
basis,
judge
bromley?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
these
letters
identified
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
is
all
an
expert?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
conflict
with
the
original
decree
and
not
as
judge
bromley
has
suggested
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
judge
rosenman,
on
number
12,
the
decree
was
1951?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
in
it
is
the
declaration
of
--
that
the
agreements
were
illegal,
null
and
void?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
12
mean
anything
like
this
that
the
declaration
as
of
may
15,
1951,
the
illegality
of
the
contracts,
embraces
as
well
the
period
up
to
the
date,
may
15,
1951,
and
that
no
claims
can
be
founded
upon
those
illegal
agreements
whether
directly
as
with
the
case
with
counts
i
and
ii?
or
since
the
use
of
your
client
was
based
originally
on
those
contracts,
was
it
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
by
way
of
quantum
meruit
and
debitatus
assumpsit
or
otherwise?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
what
that
means?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
my
question
was
whether
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
whether
this
has
to
be
read
as
based
upon
the
declaration
of
illegality.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
meaning
inclusive
of
the
date,
may
15,
1951.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
if
that's
what
it
means,
isn't
that
precisely
one
of
the
questions
which
usg
endeavored
at
least
by
its
answer
in
this
proceeding
to
put
in
issue
whether
there
had
been
a
misuse
inclusive
of
the
date
may
15,
1951?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
in
addition
to
the
pleading
because
apparently
i
gather
your
concession
embraces
as
well
the
issue
of
purge
which
by
the
pleading
they
attempted
to
put
in
issue?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
point
is
that
the
pleading
alone
and
the
effort
by
the
pleading
to
put
those
two
questions
in
issue
was
not
enough
that
they
had
affirmatively
to
proffer
proofs?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
have
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
am
i
in
error
in
dealing
that
there
at
least
some
federal
decisions
dealing
with
summary
judgment
which
suggest
that
it's
a
bar
to
the
allowance
of
summary
judgment
if
any
material
fact
is
called
an
issue
merely
by
the
pleading?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
those
decisions
are
right
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
but
i
think
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
judge
rosenman.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
just
want
to
be
sure
that
i
understand
you.
it
is
that
on
the
issues
of
purge
and
misuse
as
put
in
issue
by
the
pleading,
they
were
not,
as
a
matter
of
law,
sufficiently
put
an
issue
to
withstand
a
determination
that
the
counts
must
fail
or
is
it
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
or
both?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
