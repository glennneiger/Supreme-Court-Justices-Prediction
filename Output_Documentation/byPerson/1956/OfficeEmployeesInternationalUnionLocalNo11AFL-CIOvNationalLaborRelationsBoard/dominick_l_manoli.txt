mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
in
this
particular
case
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i'd
like
to
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
will
explain
that
in
just
one
moment,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
i
think
we
don't
quite
take
the
same
view
of
our
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
position
as
mr.
finley
has
taken.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
will.
let
me
say
first
that
the
nub
of
the
petitioner's
case
here
as
we
see
it,
as
we
understand
it
is
that
the
board
may
not
adopt
an
administrative
jurisdictional
standard,
the
effect
of
which
is
--
the
result
of
which
is
to
exclude
labor
organizations
when
acting
as
an
employers
from
the
coverage
of
the
statute
as
a
class.
now,
while
i
shall
address
myself
to
that
question
in
the
course
of
my
time,
a
serious
doubt
has
arisen
in
our
minds
at
least
whether
this
question
is
presently
a
right
for
adjudication
by
this
court
in
view
of
the
posture
of
this
case
before
the
board.
now,
let
me
explain
briefly
what
the
posture
of
this
case
was
before
the
board.
as
mr.
finley
has
indicated,
there
were
charges
filed
here
against
a
number
of
labor
organizations
and
it
was
claimed
that
these
various
labor
organizations
had
engaged
in
numerous
unfair
labor
practices
with
respect
to
their
own
employees
and
their
normal
functions
with
or
their
union
functions
in
order
to
defeat
the
efforts
of
the
petition
to
represent
these
employees
for
purpose
of
collective
bargaining.
now,
the
trial
examiner
found
that
these
labor
organizations
were
employers
with
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
that
their
activities
affected
interstate
commerce,
that
their
activities
also
met
the
board's
jurisdictional
test
with
respect
to
the
multistate
enterprises
and
that
it
would
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
statute
to
assert
jurisdiction
and
then
he
went
on
to
find
on
the
merits
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
charges.
now
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh,
yes,
complaints
issued
of
course.
now,
when
the
case
came
before
the
board,
this
is
the
posture
before
the
board,
four
members
of
the
board
agreed
with
the
trial
examiner
that
these
labor
organizations
were
employers
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
two
of
--
of
these
four
--
these
four
board
members
assumed
that
the
interstate
transactions
of
--
of
these
various
unions
satisfied
the
board's
legal
test
of
jurisdiction.
however,
they
divided
on
the
policy
question
as
to
whether
or
not
they
should
or
should
not
assert
jurisdiction.
two
of
those
four
board
members
concluded
that
--
that
they
would
not
assert
jurisdiction
because
they
regarded
these
labor
organizations
in
the
same
category
as
the
board
regards
nonprofit
enterprises
which
are
now
engaged
in
commercial
enterprise
--
in
commercial
ventures
in
the
normally
accepted
sense.
and
on
the
basis
of
that
policy,
two
of
these
board
members
voted
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
the
other
two
board
members
would
have
asserted
jurisdiction
on
the
same
basis
that
the
trial
examiner
did,
they
said
that
as
a
matter
of
policy
we
think
we
ought
to
assert
jurisdiction.the
fifth
board
member
who
is
mr.
murdock,
mr.
murdock
said,
"i
will
vote
to
dismiss
the
complaints.
i
will
join
my
two
colleagues
who
are
voting
to
dismiss
the
complaint
on
policy
grounds
but
i
joined
them
on
an
entirely
different
ground,
namely,
that
the
labor
organizations
are
not
enforced
when
they
are
acting
in
their
normal
capacity
as
distinguished
from
engaging
in
some
commercial
enterprise."
now
in
short,
you
have
--
the
complaint
here
was
dismissed
because
one
board
member,
mr.
murdock,
thought
that
the
board
lacked
power
all
together
over
this
case.
the
other
two
board
members
although
assuming
that
the
board
had
power,
nevertheless
were
not
inclined
to
exercise
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there
(inaudible)
now
gone,
that's
right.
and
so
that
you
have
four
board
members
who
divided
evenly,
two
and
two,
on
the
question
of
policy
with
the
decisive
vote
being
cast
by
senator
murdock
who
concurred
in
the
dismissal
of
the
complaint
on
power
--
on
lack
of
power,
that
the
board
lacked
power.
now,
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief
and
not
because
of
the
change
of
personnel,
it
maybe
noted
as
a
fact
of
life
that
there
has
been
a
change
of
personnel
on
the
board
but
certainly
we
would
make
the
same
suggestion
today
even
if
there
had
been
no
change
of
personnel
on
the
board
and
that
is
this.
that
we
think
that
perhaps
the
appropriate
course
for
this
court
is
to
resolve
the
threshold
question,
the
question
on
which
senator
murdock
or
mr.
murdock
went
off
on,
namely,
whether
a
labor
organization
when
acting
as
an
employer
in
his
normal
functions
is
within
the
coverage
of
the
statute,
if
of
course
this
court
decides
that
senator
murdock
is
correct
in
that
view,
that's
the
end
of
this
case.
if
on
the
other
hand,
this
court
agrees
with
the
four
board
members
that
a
labor
organization
is
an
employer
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
even
when
acting
in
its
normal
capacity,
then
we
suggest
that
this
court
addressed
itself
to
the
murdock
position.
and
if
it
concludes
that
the
senator
is
wrong,
if
it
concludes
that
--
that
the
majority
of
the
board
is
correct
in
--
in
saying
that
a
labor
organization
in
its
normal
capacity
is
an
employer
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
then
we
think
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
board
so
that
all
five
board
members
starting
from
a
common
premise
may
then
determine
whether
or
not
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
your
honor,
i
am
compelled
to
support
of
course
the
majority
position
on
that,
namely
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
that
a
labor
organization
even
its
normal
capacity
is
an
employer
within
the
meaning
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
the
board
has
agreed
on
the
question
of
its
power
but
they're
divided,
the
four
board
members
are
divided
evenly,
two
and
two,
on
the
question
of
policy.
and
as
i
said
a
moment
ago
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there
have
been
no
other
--
there
has
been
no
other
case
on
that.
this
is
the
only
case
that
we
have
on
that
--
on
that
question.(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i'm
suggesting
that
they'd
do
that,
that
this
court
may
--
may
appropriately
do
that.that
the
board
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
majority
--
the
majority
--
i
don't
know
when
you
speak
of
the
majority.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
you
mean
the
majority
that
--
that
concurred
in
dismissing
the
complaint?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
they
divided
on
the
policy
question
of
whether
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
and
as
i
say
the
decisive
vote
for
not
asserting
jurisdiction
was
cast
by
senator
murdock
but
on
the
ground
unlike
that
of
his
colleagues.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
because
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
because
you
have
no
--
you
have
no
board
majority
on
the
question
of
policy.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
your
honor,
the
court
of
appeals
treated
the
opinion
that
was
filed
by
chairman
--
then
chairman
farmer
and
peterson
as
the
board
opinion.
actually,
it's
only
the
opinion
of
the
two
member
--
of
those
two
members.
it's
not
the
board
opinion.
there
is
no
difference
as
to
the
four
board
members
if
they
had
the
power
but
there
was
a
difference.
they
split
as
to
the
policy
which
--
great,
i'm
repeating
myself,
was
resolved
by
senator
murdock
but
on
the
ground
that
the
board
lack
legal
power.
and
i
think
that
this
--
if
the
board
lacks
legal
power
here
and
it's
true
there
is
no
dispute
between
the
petitioner
and
--
and
myself
as
on
that
point.
we
take
the
position
that
the
board
does
have
legal
power
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
all
of
the
amicus
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
to
the
board.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
one
or
two
things
may
happen.
they
may
either
say
that
we
will
exercise
it
in
which
event
there
is
no
occasion
for
this
court
to
pass
upon
mr.
finley's
question.on
the
other
hand,
if
a
majority
of
the
board
then
again
reaffirms
the
position
that
is
in
matter
of
policy,
it
will
not
then
mr.
finley
of
course
may
again
take
it
to
the
course
and
come
back
here.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
let
me
say
that
there
--
that
the
amicus
is
defending.
there's
a
brief
been
filed
here
on
behalf
of
the
teamster
labor
organizations
as
amicus,
rather
a
lengthy
one,
100
and
somewhat
cases.
and
the
opposing
views
--
the
opposing
views
on
that
question
are
fully
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
in
the
amicus
brief.
the
court
will
not
be
deprived
of
--
except
for
oral
argument
on
the
part
of
amicus
which
was
not
granted.
but
in
the
briefs,
the
question
is
explored
i
think
fully
by
both
ourselves
and
the
amicus
to
the
issues
and
the
--
the
supporting
authorities
on
that
problem
will
be
before
the
court.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
this
is
a
very
unique
case,
your
honor,
if
someone
said
it's
a
free
case
i'm
quite
--
i'm
quite
well
to
believe
that
it
is.let
me
go
on
now
and
assuming
that
what
the
board
majority
has
done,
i
suppose
the
court
would
like
to
hear
on
discussion
of
that
from
us.
let's
assume
that
it's
been
a
majority
of
the
board
that
has
said
we
will
adopt
the
standard
here
and
as
mr.
finley
says
the
effect
of
that
standard
is
to
exclude
labor
organizations
when
acting
as
an
employer
from
the
coverage
of
the
statute.
now,
essentially,
mr.
finley's
position
on
that
is
that
in
view
of
the
specific
designation
of
labor
organizations
as
employers
within
the
definition
of
that
term
in
section
2
(2)
of
the
statute,
that
the
board
is
precluded
from
adopting
a
standard
which
would
mean
the
exclusion
of
--
of
labor
organizations
as
a
class
from
the
coverage
of
the
statute.
now,
preliminarily,
i
should
say
that
--
that
this
argument
overlooks
the
fact
that
the
board's
power
with
respect
to
the
exercise
of
its
discretion
does
not
stem
from
section
2
(2)
of
the
statute
but
rather
from
section
10.
section
2
(2)
of
the
statute
merely
defines
a
term
employers
who
are
within
the
coverage
of
the
statute,
but
it
is
section
10
of
the
act,
however,
which
vest
authority
in
the
board
to
take
action,
to
exercise
it's
jurisdiction.
and
that
section
of
the
--
that
section
of
the
statute
as
this
court
had
very
reasonable
case
and
they're
not
noticed
is
cast
in
permissive
terms.
the
statute
says
that
the
board
is
empowered
to
prevent
any
person
from
engaging
unfair
labor
practice.
it
shall
have
the
power
to
issue
complaints,
and
the
statute
also
gives
the
board
a
broad
discretion
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
what
type
of
order
will
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act
and
even
where
it
enters
an
order.
the
board
may
or
may
not
as
complete
discretion
on
the
matter
whether
to
seek
judicial
enforcement
of
its
orders.
what
i'm
getting
at
is
this
that
the
whole
tenure
of
section
10
is
cast
in
the
permissive
language
and
we
believe
that
that
section
of
the
statute
vest
in
the
board
the
power
to
determine
the
discretionary
authority,
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
public
interest
will
be
better
served,
whether
the
posture
of
the
statute
will
be
better
effectuated
by
asserting
or
declining
to
assert
its
jurisdiction
over
a
particular
case
or
a
class
of
cases.
now,
mr.
finley
says,
well,
the
board
may
--
may
have
the
power,
it
would
have
some
discretion
perhaps
to
decline
--
to
assert
its
jurisdiction
but
it
can't
adopt
the
standard
which
excludes
a
whole
class
of
employers
from
the
--
from
the
coverage
of
the
statute.
i
suggest
your
honor
that
in
dealing
with
that
issue
that
the
--
the
fact
that
a
board
administrative
standard
may
exclude
a
whole
class
of
employers
from
the
coverage
of
the
statute
of
this.
well,
that's
the
administrative
policies
in
effect
does
not
necessarily
--
does
not
necessarily
destroy
the
validity
of
the
standard,
that
the
decisive
factor
is
what
are
the
underlying
reasons
that
--
that
lead
the
board,
prompt
the
board
to
adopt
such
a
standard.
now,
take
this
case.
here
--
again,
i
am
assuming
you
that
this
is
the
board
majority
position.
actually,
it's
the
position
of
only
two
members
of
the
board.
here,
the
board
said
in
effect
that
we
think
that
these
labor
organizations,
they're
of
not
of
a
nonprofit
character,
they're
not
engaged
in
the
commercial
venture
and
we
think
that
we
ought
to
treat
to
them
just
as
we
treat
for
jurisdictional
purposes
that
we
think
we
ought
to
treat
them
just
like
we
treat
other
types
of
nonprofit
non-commercial
enterprises,
not
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
the
underlying
reason
is
this,
your
honor,
that
while
the
activities
of
some
of
these
nonprofit
non-commercial
enterprises
may
in
some
situations
take
place
across
state
lines
and
while
they
may
satisfy
the
board's
legal
test
of
its
jurisdiction,
nevertheless,
the
board
has
felt
that
--
in
general,
on
the
whole
that
the
prejudice
to
the
national
economy
that
it
would
result
from
a
disruption
of
the
activity
of
these
noncommercial
enterprises
would
be
relatively
--
would
be
relatively
insubstantial.
and
in
line
with
the
board's
basic
position,
it's
basically
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
think
that
there's
a
common
denominator
here,
your
honor.
there's
a
common
denominator
between
the
ordinary
type
of
noncommercial
--
nonprofit
noncommercial
enterprise
and
labor
organizations
here.
here,
the
labor
organizations
are
not
engaged
in
any
commercial
enterprise.
they're
not
engaged
in
any
--
in
any
profit
--
any
profit
venture.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
is
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
there
would
undoubtedly
be
some
--
some
impact
--
some
impact
on
commerce.
we're
not
--
well,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
there
wouldn't
be
so
as
to
bring
them
within
the
board's
legal
test
of
its
jurisdiction.
but
i
think
it
could
properly
be
said
at
least
there
wouldn't
be
completely
unreasonable
for
the
board
to
conclude
that
strikes
affecting
office
employees
of
--
or
the
various
employees
of
labor
organizations
that
on
balance
there
of
such
a
character
as
not
to
seriously
prejudice
the
national
economy.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
it
all
depends,
your
honor.
if
the
--
the
nonprofit
cooperatives,
it
--
there
are
cases
in
which
it
has
declined
to
assert
jurisdiction
because
in
the
particular
case
the
board
thought
they
were
not
engaged
in
some
commercial
ventures.
but
as
i
recall
they
were
in
our
briefs,
the
cases
are.
as
i
recall,
there
had
been
also
cooperative
enterprises
where
there
was
some
kind
of
commercial
activity
going
on
there
and
there
the
board
has
asserted
jurisdiction
over
that
kind
of
--
over
that
kind
of
an
enterprise.
now,
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
if
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
that
raises
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
might
lie
--
that
might
lie,
your
honor.
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
mandamus
might
lie.
in
the
fact,
i
think
one
of
your
honors'
questions
in
the
preemption
cases
has
suggested
that
to
a
number
of
counsel
that
they
have
that
course
open
if
the
board
cannot
decline
to
assert
--
cannot
decline
to
assert
jurisdiction.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
i
understand.
the
--
now
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
the
same
problem
i
think
underlies
if
--
if
we
take
this
to
the
board's
majority
position
that
it
excludes
--
i
want
to
say
one
more
thing
before
i
--
on
that.
it
just
occurs
to
me
but
the
board
has
taken
the
position
they
will
not
assert
jurisdiction
over
city
hotel
industry
as
a
class
or
all
the
taxicab
--
the
industry
even
though
the
taxicab
industry
or
the
hotel
industry
may
come
within
the
sleeve
of
jurisdiction.
and
if
mr.
finley's
position
--
formulation
of
the
board's
position
here
is
correct
that
the
board
has
declined
jurisdiction
over
labor
organizations
when
acting
as
employers
as
a
class,
then
of
course
the
problem
is
also
through
these
other
cases
--
of
this
other
situations,
the
hotel
industry.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
i
say
this,
your
honor,
that
it
--
that
i
think
that
we
cannot
assume
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
we
--
we
cannot
--
we
cannot
--
no,
no,
not
because
of
this
number,
not
because
of
the
number.
but
i
think
that
mr.
finley
isn't
correct
in
saying
that
the
board's
test
here
has
excluded
labor
organizations
when
acting
as
employers
as
a
class
from
the
coverage
of
the
statute.
the
board's
test,
this
nonprofit
non-enterprise
test
applies
to
labor
organizations
only
when
they
are
acting
in
their
normal
functions.
the
test
does
not
apply
to
them
when
as
and
if
they
may
engage
in
commercial
enterprises.
now,
it
maybe
that
it's
a
rare
case
where
they
directly
--
directly
engage
in
a
commercial
enterprise,
although
there
are
numerous
cases
where
they
engage
in
commercial
enterprises
for
some
corporate
structure.
they
owned
the
stock.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh,
there
are
banks
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there
are
banks,
hotels
or
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
that's
out
of
this
exclusion.
that's
correct.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
pardon?
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
they
amalgamated
it
as
(inaudible)
that's
right.
that's
right,
so
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
now,
we
say
that
the
board
standard
does
not
apply
--
does
not
apply
to
a
union
whenever
it
engages
in
that
kind
of
an
enterprise
and
that
it's
not
true
to
say
--
it's
not
correct
to
say
that
the
board's
standard
has
virtually
wiped
out
labor
organizations
from
the
coverage
of
the
statute.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
--
if
we
take
that
two
board
member
position,
there
is
that
class
exclusion.
and
i
have
suggested
that
the
fact
that
there
is
a
class
--
class
exclusion
does
not
necessarily
invalidate
it,
that
we
must
look
to
the
reasons
and
we
think
that
here
the
board
could
properly
say
--
could
properly
say
that
because
of
the
character
of
the
enterprise
and
it
can
treat
them
just
as
it
treats
other
nonprofit
noncommercial
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
makes
no
--
it
makes
no
distinction
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
on
that
basis.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
all
that
does
is
simply
give
the
board
legal
power,
legal
power
over
a
labor
organization
whether
it's
acting
in
a
commercial
capacity
or
a
non-commercial
capacity.
but
it
doesn't
go
to
the
question
of
how
the
board
will
exercise
that
jurisdiction.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
on
that
one
of
course,
your
honor,
we
have
entirely
different
standards
because
there
the
union
is
not
an
employer
under
section
8
(b)
provisions.
the
section
8
(b)
provisions
reached
the
union
there
because
those
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
of
course
that
was
the
senator
murdock's
position
but
our
answer
to
that
--
my
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
is
that
the
section
8
(b)
does
not
shed
any
light
upon
the
coverage
of
section
8
(a)
with
respect
to
unions
when
they
are
acting
as
employers.
section
8
(b)
is
directed
to
unions
not
when
they're
acting
as
employers
but
rather
when
they
are
organizing
the
employees
of
other
employers
and
it
places
restrictions
upon
what
they
may
do,
not
vis-à-vis
their
own
employees
but
rather
vis-à-vis
the
employees
of
other
employers.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
labor
union,
when
acting
as
an
employer,
as
a
matter
of
law?
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
as
a
matter
of
law,
yes.
as
a
matter
of
policy,
that's
the
--
that's
the
argument.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
no,
no,
no,
8
(a)
is
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
you're
correct.
that's
right.
and
the
section
8
(a)
would
apply
to
a
labor
organization
lifts
a
discharge
in
one
of
its
employers,
discharge
one
of
its
employers
because
he
adjourned
some
other
union
or
threaten
to
discharge
him
or
engage
in
any
--
of
the
other
8
(a)
type
of
the
employer
unfair
labor
practice.
that
would
apply
that
union
in
that
situation.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
8
(b)
--
8
(b)
would
apply
generally
to
any
--
any
situation
where
the
union
was
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
of
course
8
(b)
has
to
do
with
secondary
boycott
jurisdictional
strikes.
section
8
(b)
(1)
says
that
--
that
the
union
shall
not
restrain
or
coerce
employees
in
the
exercise
of
their
rights
under
section
7.
now,
conceivably
a
union
might
be
reached
under
that
section
--
under
that
section
with
respect
to
its
own
employees.
but
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
sir.
not
--
none
that
i
know
of.
thank
you.
