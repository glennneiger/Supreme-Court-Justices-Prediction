justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
you
suggesting
from
what
you
now
giving
is
in
a
way
of
legislative
history
that
there
is
in
effect
the
mandate
upon
the
board
in
the
cases
where
apart
from
the
question
justice
douglas
just
referred
to
where
the
union
is
an
employer,
that
the
congress
contemplated
that
other
provisions
of
the
act
being
met,
that
the
board
would
exercise
jurisdiction.
is
that
the
point
you're
making
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
may
not
decline
because
that's
stated
the
other
way
or
conversely
or
rather
affirmatively
mean
much
assert.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
aren't
--
aren't
you
really
saying
that
assuming
a
charge,
which
ordinarily
ought
to
result
in
the
complaint
because
it
establishes
an
unfair
labor
practice,
made
against
a
union
as
an
employer.
aren't
you
arguing
that
the
congress,
indicated
by
this
legislative
history,
contemplated
that
the
board
must
in
such
circumstances
proceed
with
the
complaint?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you're
not,
i'm
trying
to
find
out
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
where
you
stop
short.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
--
that's
where
they
feel
that
a
given
charge,
even
if
it
has
merit
or
whatnot
result
in
a
complaint,
isn't
that
what
you're
talking
about?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it's
part
from
that.
assume
you
have
a
case
of
a
charge,
which
ordinarily
if
it
were
not
that
the
union
was
the
employer
wouldn't
result
in
a
complaint.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
it
your
argument
now
that
the
congress
intended
that
it
must
result
in
a
complaint
where
the
employer
was
a
labor
union?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
appreciate
what
it
does.
i'm
just
trying
to
get
at
--
what
your
position
is.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
i
--
i
have
an
impression
of
an
office
building
in
my
hometown
that's
rented
out
to
--
to
lawyers
and
accountants
and
everyone
else
and
it's
owned
by
a
labor
union.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
isn't
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
isn't
that
a
commercial
enterprise
of
the
labor
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
does
in
the
instance
i'm
talking
about.
it
just
leases
out
that
owns
the
building
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
know
a
thing
about
it
other
than
it's
--
it's
called.
i
think
it's
given
the
name
of
the
union.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
that's
the
situation
that
would
be
an
instance
of
commercial
operation
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
a
complaint
issued
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
(inaudible)
now
gone?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
--
which
position
on
the
murdock
point
are
you
supporting?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
only
a
dissenting
view
then
of
mr.
murdock
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
within
the
board
as
presently
composed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
--
i
know
but
i
mean
on
this
murdock
point,
he's
the
only
one
who
opposed
toward
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
i'm
just
a
little
interested
why
--
why
we
should
take
up
even
that
murdock
point
in
place
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
position
of
the
board
majority
that
it
does
embrace
labor
union
employers.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
other
thing
that
bothers
me,
mr.
manoli,
you're
--
you're
asking
us
to
resolve
the
murdock
position
and
there's
no
one
here
defending
the
murdock
position.
both
sides
are
opposed
to
the
murdock
position
as
i
understand
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
unusual
to
me
to
tell
it
--
as
does
to
tell
that
the
senator
is
wrong
if
apparently
the
majority
view
in
the
board
is
that
--
that
he
is
wrong.

like

haven't
they?
justice
william

summer

summer

summer
resorts
or
homes
for
the
aged
and
what
have
you
--
there's
--
they
say
now
--
i
don't
want
to
overstate
my
position
on
that.
it
is
true
that
the
union
seldom
directly
engages
in
a
commercial
enterprise.
it's
usually
done
through
some
stock
corporate
--
corporate
ownership.
