justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
they've
cut
out
a
category
of
cases,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
you,
as
i
understand
you,
you
thought
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
the
board
differentiating
for
purposes
of
entertaining
complaint
or
initiating
complaint
as
between
what
you
call
a
big
labor
union
or
small
labor
union,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
grounds
that
not
to
deal
with
small
ones
would
not
frustrate
or
would
be
an
exercise
by
it
or
what
does
and
doesn't
effectuate
for
purposes
of
the
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
that
the
board
can't
differentiate
between
a
labor
union
also
employing
as
it
necessarily
does
some
people
and
other
employers,
that's
your
position
is
it,
rather
i
over
simplified
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
your
position
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
all
employers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
once
you've
said
that
--
once
you've
said
that
then
we
have
to
consider
or
not
whether
the
board
--
the
board's
ground
isn't
a
reason
that
one
must
respect
as
rational
although
once
--
itself
doesn't
entertain
it,
is
that
right?
what
you're
saying
they
must
scrutinize
it
to
find
out
whether
there
isn't
a
difference
then
--
then
the
consideration
is
--
then
the
real
question
is
whether
we
sitting
here
can
say,
this
court
can
say,
there
is
no
justifications
between,
including
union
as
an
employer
in
one
category
as
against
people
engaged
in
commercial
business
--
in
commercial
enterprises
as
they
achieve
them
in
life,
at
least
they
achieve
out
with
activity,
is
that
right?
that's
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
certainly,
i'm
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
when
we
you
say
for
the
purpose
of
that,
if
there
are
any
hearing
social
economic
after,
aren't
those
relevant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
to
say
they
have
given
a
reason
which
is
untenable,
non
constat
they
couldn't
give
a
good
reason,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i
don't
see
how
you
can
say
that
when
there
is
on
the
statute
book
a
very
important
measure
to
which
the
clayton
act,
on
which
in
significant
sentence
is
labor
should
not
be
deemed
of
the
commodities
or
whatever
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
there,
drastic
of
differences
could
be
in
the
conceptual
congressional
policy
that
when
you're
dealing
with
state
of
labor,
you
rephrase
that
it's
like
very
much,
when
you
deal
with
--
with
humans
trying
to
be
active
in
the
organization
which
promotes
those
interests,
why
isn't
--
why
is
it
so
irrational?
i'm
not
saying
that
vague
union
or
a
religious
organization
or
it
may
be
occasional,
but
certainly
has
this
educational
aspect.
it
has
charitable
aspect
and
all
the
things
that
you
say
just
what
you
exceeded.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
theory
will
be
satisfied
if
the
board
made
it
a
rule
to
consider
union
employers
in
the
case
of
union's
having
a
membership
of
500,000
or
more.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
fact
that
you
know
and
we
know
less
shows
what
a
policy
question
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can't
leave
them
all
out
together
is
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
finley,
may
i
ask
you
and
i
--
i
will
understand
if
you
say
you're
not
here.
you
don't
have
to
carry
more
of
a
burden
than
you
have
to
carry.
hasn't
the
board
indicated
by
a
rule
or
by
--
by
a
decision
or
whatever
you
call
it
that
there's
certain
industries
that
--
that
they
will
not
take
cases
in?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
know
whether
your
--
the
question
we
have
doesn't
involve
that
issue
also.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
--
wanted
your
view
when
--
when
mr.
manoli
comes
to
argue
his
view
as
to
the
reach
of
the
problem
it
was
and
you
--
you
are
entitled
to
say
you're
dealing
with
this
problem
and
the
other
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
the
board
--
well,
mr.
manoli
would
tell
us
(inaudible)
has
the
board
taken
a
definite
position
on
this
matter?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i
don't
mean
just
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
an
ad
hoc
case
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
that's
--
that's
quite
necessary
about
the
last
point
that
mr.
finley
made,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
telling
that
as
the
outset,
what
the
position
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
manoli,
do
i
--
do
i
--
set
me
straight
on
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
i'm
sure
i
misunderstand
you.
do
i
get
the
impression
from
you
that
this
court
can
decide
what
would
be
more
or
less
an
abstract
question
that
the
court's
power
over
a
union
employer
but
by
remanding
it
to
the
board,
the
board
can
say
yes,
we
have
the
power
but
we
didn't
exercise
it
in
any
union
employer
case,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
speak
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
--
and
you
urge
on,
speaking
for
the
board
--
let's
see
if
i'm
right,
speaking
for
the
board,
you
submit
to
this
court
the
proposition
which
you
want
this
court
to
decide
that
there
is
naked
policy,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
say
whether
it
should
be
exercised
and
send
it
back
to
the
court
--
to
the
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
i
suggest
this
that
the
argument
and
i
ask
this,
not
suggest,
i
ask,
because
i
followed
mr.
finley's
argument.
mr.
finley's
argument
is
that
they
cannot,
as
an
exercise
of
discretion,
abdicate
power
over
a
whole
class
or
a
whole
category
of
employers.
and
you
suggest
--
you
will
come
to
that
i'm
sure.
what
you
suggest
on
this
third
question
what
we
should
do
when
you
were
talking
to
(inaudible)
not
to
decided
any
more
than
one
has
to.
but
you
suggest
we
should
decide
the
naked
question
of
power
that
the
board
may
then
say
the
supreme
court
has
recognized
that
we
have
power
and
we
in
our
own
right
now
decide
we'll
never
exercise
it.
and
mr.
finley
would
be
back
and
say
they
can't
do
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
manoli,
what
has
the
board
done
about
nonprofit
cooperative?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
mr.
finley
is
correct,
the
jurisdiction
has
to
be
asserted,
the
board
could
be
mandamus
to
take
it
effectively.
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
commerce
commission
can't
say
we
will
take
reparation
suit,
they
could
be
mandamus.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
--
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
as
an
argument
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
--
is
my
question
that
i
took
from
mr.
finley
and
to
you.
does
this
--
if
--
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
the
problem
in
this
case
implicates
the
exclusion
of
the
hotel
construction
industry?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
--
why
is
it
if
--
it
has
declined,
hasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
actually
because
of
this
number
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
it
--
or
they
--
they
amalgamated
as
a
bank?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
they
sometimes
go
into
shares
with
manufacturers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
out
--
that's
out
of
this
of
this
exclusion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
an
automated
bank
in
new
york
but
it's
separate
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
within
the
circle
that
mr.
finley
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
a
class
exclusion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
you're
saying
is
that
that's
a
jurisdictional
section
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
not
an
enforcing
section.
