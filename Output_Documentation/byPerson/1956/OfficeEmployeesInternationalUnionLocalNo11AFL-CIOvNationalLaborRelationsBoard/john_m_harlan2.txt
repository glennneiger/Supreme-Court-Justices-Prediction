is
there
any
dispute
as
to
the
board's
power
here?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
made
jurisdiction
in
the
sense
of
power?
justice
john
m.
harlan
just
a
question
of
whether
they
abuse
their
discretion?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
put
your
question
and
see
if
i
understand
it
because
i
have
the
same
trouble
as
justice
brennan
does.
i'd
understood
your
position
to
be
that
although
there
was
power
here,
jurisdiction
in
the
sense
of
power,
that
the
board
by
applying
its
internal
regulation
is
applicable
to
charitable
organizations.
this
labor
union
had
in
effect
wiped
out
--
wiped
out
any
jurisdiction
over
labor
union
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
despite
the
provisions
of
the
act.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
then
the
second
string
to
your
argument
was
that
even
if
that
--
that
there
were
no
other
regulations,
no
other
administrative
regulations
applicable
to
labor
unions,
it
would
justify
a
refusal
to
accept
jurisdiction,
is
that
--
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
pursuing
justice
brennan's
question,
could
exposing
the
board
establish
a
bunch
of
regulations
now
saying
under
these
circumstances
we
would
apply
to
exercise
--
by
exercising
jurisdiction
over
labor
unions
employer,
could
it
do
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
isn't
what
i
asked
you.
i
asked
you
could
they
pass
regulations
saying
that
--
i'm
not
reading
them
all
out
but
about
such-and-such
a
kind
of
a
dispute
or
the
amount
it
involved
in
such-and-such,
we
declined
to
take
jurisdiction,
could
they
do
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
could
they
do
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
could.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
didn't
the
court
of
appeals
show
they
had
power?
justice
john
m.
harlan
isn't
