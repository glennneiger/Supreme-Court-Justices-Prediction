mr.
joseph
e.
finley
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
the
important
public
issue
of
whether
or
not
labor
unions,
when
dealing
with
their
own
employees,
must
obey
the
law
in
the
same
fashion
as
do
commercial
employers.
the
case
arose
in
1954
in
portland,
oregon,
where
the
teamsters
unions
there
were
allegedly
involved
in
unfair
labor
practices
against
their
own
employees,
that
is
their
office
and
clerical
employees.
petitioner,
which
is
a
local
union
of
the
office
employes
international
union,
filed
these
charges.
the
matter
came
on
for
hearing
before
a
trial
examiner
of
the
board.
and
on
the
merits
of
the
case,
the
trial
examiner
found
the
six
teamster
respondents
and
i
refer
to
them
here
as
teamster
respondents.
before
the
board
there
was
international
brotherhood
of
teamsters,
two
of
its
locals,
the
joint
council
and
two
other
subsidiary
organizations
and
we
lumped
them
together
as
labor
organizations
as
teamster
respondents
for
the
purposes
of
arguing
this
case.
the
examiner
found
on
the
merits
that
the
teamsters
unions
toward
their
own
employees
violated
sections
8
(a)
1,
2,
3,
4
and
5
encompassing
all
the
unfair
--
employer
unfair
labor
practice
provisions
of
the
act.
on
the
question
of
board
jurisdiction,
which
is
the
only
question,
the
only
legal
question
before
this
court,
the
examiner
found
that
the
teamster
organizations
were
integral
parts
of
a
multistate
enterprise.
he
found
that
in
1953,
the
year
prior
to
the
hearing,
some
approximately
$6
million
induce
an
initiation
fees
across
state
lines.
the
examiner
further
found
that
since
the
board
normally
asserts
its
jurisdiction
over
multistate
enterprises,
it
would
assert
jurisdiction
here.
the
case
came
on
before
the
nlrb
and
the
board
split
three
ways,
the
controlling
decision
of
--
then
chairman
farmer
and
member
peterson,
which
is
the
decision
we
are
challenging
here,
held
in
substance
that
the
teamsters
as
unions
were
not
engaged
in
a
proper
enterprise.
they
were
not
engaged
in
commercial
business
and
that
the
board
normally,
so
that
decision
said,
did
not
assert
its
jurisdiction
over
so-called
nonprofit
non-commercial
organizations,
and
since
the
teamsters
were
not
nonprofit
non-commercial,
we
will
not
assert
our
jurisdiction
over
them
because
it
will
not
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act.
member
murdock
in
a
separate
concurring
opinion
read
the
congressional
intent
is
not
to
include
union
as
employers
engaging
--
when
they
are
engaged
their
trade
union
capacities,
and
he
voted
to
dismiss
the
complaints
also.
two
dissenting
board
members
took
the
position
that
the
board
should
assert
its
jurisdiction,
and
they
relied
largely,
i
think,
upon
the
equity
principle
that
if
commercial
employers
must
obey
the
law
towards
their
own
employees,
so
should
organizations.
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
that
court
in
a
2-to-1
decision
affirmed
the
board.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
board
had
a
wide
discretion
in
the
exercise
of
its
jurisdiction
and
that
it
had
made
a
rational
finding
in
lumping
these
labor
unions
in
a
category
with
other
nonprofit
non-commercial
organizations.
and
therefore,
this
was
a
rational
finding
and
they
would
not
disturb
it.
now,
judge
bazelon
dissented,
a
very
short
dissent
saying
that
the
reference
in
section
2
(2)
of
the
act,
which
i
will
refer
to
in
a
moment,
to
labor
unions
distinguish
them
from
the
normal
nonprofit
non-commercial
organization
or
which
the
board
had
refused
to
take
jurisdiction.
now,
section
2
(2)
of
the
act
which
--
from
which
this
controversy
flows
was
enacted
--
remains
the
same
today
as
it
was
when
it
was
enacted
in
the
law
in
1935.
now,
section
2
(2)
defines
employers
and
excludes
therefrom
labor
organizations
(other
than
when
acting
as
an
employer)
and
that's
the
statutory
language
here
that
we
come
--
we
bring
this
case
on.
now,
petitioners
first
element
of
argument
is
that
the
board
in
declining,
and
i
say
declining
to
assert
its
jurisdiction,
ignored
the
intent
of
congress
in
enacting
this
specific
provision
of
section
2
(2)
and
that
is
arbitrary
and
capricious
to
ignore
the
congressional
intent.
and
our
second
contention
is
that
in
any
event
it
was
arbitrary
to
place
unions
in
a
category
with
a
university
or
a
symphony
orchestra
or
a
live
(inaudible)
or
something
of
that
nature.
now,
let
us
look
for
a
moment
at
the
legislative
history
of
this
provision.
the
first
comprehensive
labor
act
was
introduced
by
senator
wagner
in
1934
in
the
73rd
congress.
senator
wagner
in
his
employer
definition
section
excluded
labor
organizations.
the
bill
was
referred
to
committee,
hearings
were
held
and
the
senate
labor
committee
and
i
might
say
which
mr.
justice
black
was
a
member
at
that
time,
reported
the
bill
out
and
changed
the
language
of
section
2
(2)
to
read
exactly
as
it
does
today.
and
the
committee
put
in
the
parenthetical
expression
other
than
when
acting
as
an
employer.
and
accompanying
that
bill
out
of
committee
was
senate
report
number
1184
in
the
73rd
congress,
which
is
set
forth
--
the
pertinent
provisions
are
set
forth
on
page
13
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
it's
in
the
board
brief
and
the
essential
notation
is
that
the
congressional
committee
referred
to
the
same
kind
of
people
who
are
involved
in
this
case,
clerks,
secretaries
and
the
like,
office
employees.
the
committee
said
every
labor
organizations
--
in
one
sense
every
labor
organization
is
an
employer,
it
hires
clerks,
secretaries
and
the
like.
in
its
relations
with
its
own
employees,
a
labor
organization
ought
to
be
treated
as
an
employer,
and
the
bill
so
provides.
the
labor
bill
field
of
enactment
in
the
73rd
congress
and
when
the
74th
congress
convened
in
1935,
senator
wagner
again
introduced
his
labor
bill.
and
once
again,
senator
wagner
went
back
to
his
original
language,
he
just
exclude
labor
organizations
and
did
not
have
the
parenthetical
expression.
the
bill
went
to
committee,
the
senate
labor
committee,
with
again
mr.
justice
black
was
a
member
of
that
committee,
reported
the
bill
out
and
changed
the
language
once
again
back
to
the
same
language
as
it
had
done
in
1934.
and
that
bill
s1958
became
the
national
labor
relations
act,
the
wagner
act.
and
the
statutory
language
has
remained
the
same
to
this
day.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
no,
sir,
i
don't
think
it's
a
question
of
power
at
all.
i
think
--
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
i
think
it
can
be
phrased
in
those
terms.
and
i
think
the
congressional
intent
and
the
reason
i
have
gone
into
legislative
history
shows
an
intention
of
congress
that
the
board
should
not
read
out
of
the
act,
labor
organizations.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
that
was
a
particular
position
of
mr.
murdock
--
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
that's
involved
in
the
problem
--
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
--
and
i'm
going
to
discuss
that
in
a
moment,
your
honor,
because
i
think
it
--
it
reflects
upon
what
the
board
has
done
here
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
well,
i
don't
think
it's
quite
that
way,
your
honor.
i
think
the
point
i'm
making
here
is
this.
the
board
may
not
decline
to
assert
it's
jurisdiction
over
labor
organizations
all
together
as
employers
in
view
of
the
statutory
language
and
in
view
of
the
specific
legislative
history
would
show
the
intent
of
congress.
it's
when
the
board
collides
with
the
intent
of
congress
as
expressed
in
the
history
that
it
takes
an
arbitrary
point
of
view.
now
--
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
no,
sir,
it
does
not
and
that
is
one
of
the
crucial
points
in
this
case.
section
10
(a),
as
we
all
know,
provides
that
the
board
is
empowered
to
prevent
unfair
labor
practices
not
directed
as
the
courts
below
have
held
many
times.
and
the
board
reads
that
in
a
broad
discretion
and
how
it
will
deal
with
unfair
labor
practices.
now,
this
to
me
in
this
particular
case
means
that
the
board
yet
may
exercise
a
discretion
as
to
whether
or
not
it
will
remedy
a
particular
unfair
labor
practice
or
not,
as
to
whether
or
not
effectuation
--
a
remedy
will
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act
in
the
particular
facts
and
the
particular
circumstances.
but
i
don't
believe
that
section
10
(a)'s
language
allows
the
board
to
take
a
whole
class
of
employers
and
just
remove
them
from
the
coverage
of
the
act
under
a
claim
discretion.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
i
--
i
think
again
--
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
yes.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
that's
--
that's
what
i'm
trying
--
trying
to
make
here.
i
think
the
board
could
decline
its
jurisdiction
in
particular
facts
and
particular
circumstances
that
it
has
done
on
many
occasions.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
there
are
cases
of
that
kind.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
yes.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
that
given
premise
assumes
a
great
deal
about
the
merits
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
charge
which
i
don't
think
is
involved
here.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
well,
i
think
qualifying
it
by
inquiring
into
the
merits
of
the
particular
charge.
what
i'm
saying
is
in
this
particular
kind
of
case
here
that
we
have
before
us,
where
we
have
a
labor
organization
which
certainly
don't
affect
the
largest
labor
organization
in
the
country,
the
board
may
not
decline
its
jurisdiction
on
the
ground
that
it
has
given
us
here,
that
it
will
just
not
deal
with
this
question
at
all
regardless
of
the
merits
of
the
unfair
labor
practices
involved.
and
i
think
there
is
a
difference
between
a
total
declining
of
jurisdiction
and
a
mandate
to
assert.
i
don't
claim
a
mandate
to
assert,
but
i
do
claim
it
is
wrongful
in
law
to
decline
all
together
which
is
what
the
board
has
done
based
on
this
particular
case.
now,
if
this
case
reached
the
merits,
the
board
--
the
board
might
decide
it
on
the
merits
of
this
case
that
it
would
not
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act
on
the
particular
merits.
i
don't
think
they
reached
that
conclusion
because
there
are
some
pretty
flagrant
violations
here
but
they
could.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
a
category
of
employer.
all
labor
unions
who
employed
persons.
they
removed
them
from
the
act
and
in
effect
what
the
board
has
done
is
take
the
original
language
of
senator
wagner,
just
as
he
introduced
the
labor
bill.
now,
in
that
connection,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
all
--
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
well,
the
second
string
to
my
argument
is
that
it
--
it's
arbitrary
to
take
unions
and
place
them
in
a
jurisdictional
category
that
the
board
had
setup
--
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
--
for
a
so-called
nonprofit
non-commercial.
i
think
that's
a
misleading
term.
the
board
has
declined
jurisdiction
over
operations
of
educational,
religious
and
scientific
charitable
organizations
in
connection
with
the
congressional
history
in
1947,
which
is
present
regarding
those
employers.
but
when
congress
gave
us
that
1947
history,
they
certainly
did
nothing
about
the
provisions
of
section
2
(2)
with
relation
to
labor
unions
as
employers
covered
under
section
2
(2).
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
i
think
because
of
the
legislative
history
we
have
in
this
case,
on
this
particular
situation,
anytime
the
board
rules
labor
unions
out
of
the
act
all
together
as
employers,
that
is
contrary
to
what
congress
desired
when
it
wrote
this
section
2
(2)
of
the
law.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
well,
i
think
you're
referring
to
the
board's
dollar
volume
yardstick
--
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
--
questions
with
jurisdiction.
i
don't
think
that
question
is
in
this
case.
i
say
--
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
with
regard
to
labor
unions?
yes,
they
could.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
they
could
say,
“we
will
take
jurisdiction
over
the
big
labor
unions,
but
the
little
small
labor
unions
that
don't
affect
commerce,
we
will
use
our
jurisdictional
yardsticks
and
not
take
jurisdiction.
there's
a
discretionary
power
under
section
10
(a)."
certainly,
i
--i
agree
to
that
point.
with
--
with
regard
to
the
point
that
i
think
mr.
justice
douglas
asked
a
moment
ago
about
the
position
of
member
murdock,
about
the
commercial
activities
of
labor
organizations,
the
board
has
argued
here
that
it
is
not
declining
jurisdiction
over
unions
as
a
class
but
merely
when
they
engage
in
trade
union
activities,
implying
that
when
they
embark
upon
a
commercial
venture,
we'll
assert
our
jurisdiction.
now,
petitioner
has
taken
a
very
strong
stand
on
this
point,
i
think
reasonably
solvent.
and
my
position
is
a
simple
affirmative
assertion
that
labor
unions
do
not
have
employees
on
their
payroll
in
commercial
businesses.
it
is
a
fact
of
life
which
the
board
has
totally
ignored
in
this
case.
and
i
have
challenged
the
board
in
its
brief
to
show
us
examples
of
unions
with
employees
on
their
payroll
in
commercial
business.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
i
happen
to
have
my
office
in
one,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
the
same
kind.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
the
union
uses
this
building
as
a
home.
it's
its
house
--
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
it
has
--
it
does
not
use
it
for
housing
purposes.
do
you
--
does
your
honor
know
whether
the
building
is
owned
by
a
corporation
when
the
stock
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
well,
there
are
numerous
instances
as
we
point
out.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
if
that
--
if
that
is
the
fact,
yes,
but
we
don't
know
the
facts
of
the
situation
and
i
don't
know
of
any.
there
maybe
rare
instances
where
this
maybe
true.
the
board
has
tried
to
come
up
with
--
with
instances
of
this
kind
but
there
are
no
instances
that
i
know
about
as
a
fact
that
unions
have
employees
on
their
payrolls
in
commercial
businesses.
now,
they
can
own
stock
in
corporations,
members
of
unions
can
own
stock
in
corporations
and
the
--
and
the
business
can
be
surrounded
with
an
atmosphere
of
union
--
of
union
control
certainly,
but
it's
the
corporation
that
it
is
the
employer,
not
the
stockholders,
not
the
union.
and
anytime
there's
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
a
commercial
activity
of
this
kind,
the
board
has
a
simple
way
for
a
remedy.
all
it
needs
to
do
is
issue
an
order
direct
against
the
corporation
and
the
corporation
must
comply
and
you
remedied
your
unfair
labor
practice.
you
have
no
occasion
to
reach
behind
the
so-called
corporate
veil
that
the
board
is
bringing
in
here
which
i
think
is
a
diversionary
argument.
it
doesn't
meet
the
real
test.
and
when
we
add
further
to
the
fact
that
congress
wasn't
talking
about
commercial
activities
and
non-commercial
activities,
the
senate
committee
in
1934
said
clerks,
secretaries
and
the
like,
and
that's
what
we
have
involved
in
this
particular
case.
now,
with
regard
to
--
i
would
like
to
take
one
of
the
point
about
--
the
point
you
raise,
mr.
justice
brennan,
if
we
could
find
rare
isolated
examples
of
unions
engaging
direct
in
businesses,
i
can't
say
there
are
none
because
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
of
any
but
there
might
be
some.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
--
again,
i
don't
know
how
many
labor
unions
there
are
in
this
country,
but
i
think
a
figure
of
10,000
would
be
very
conservative.
and
if
you
can
find
one,
two
or
even
a
dozen
instances
of
unions
with
employees
on
their
payrolls,
engaged
in
commercial
business,
i
say
in
relation
to
the
massive
unions
in
this
country,
de
minimis
non
curat
lex.
and
for
all
practical
purposes,
the
board
here
has
read
unions
as
employers
completely
out
of
the
act.
and
we
come
back
around
in
our
circle,
right
back
again
to
what
senator
wagner
had
intended
and
the
board
by
so
doing
this
has
given
us
senator
wagner's
bill
back
in
the
73rd
congress.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
i
think
it
could
do
that,
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
if
you
concede
the
board's
power,
yes.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
i
think
it
is,
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
no,
i
don't
say
that
the
board
is
trying
to
place
petition
in
position
here
of
saying
that
congress
wasn't,
that
this
means
that
union
should
be
treated
differently
than
other
employers.
that's
not
the
case
at
all.
the
board
couldn't
rule
all
employers
out
of
the
act.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
it
couldn't
do
that
or
else
it
would
destroy
the
act.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
and
when
it
starts
taking
out
particular
classifications
of
employers,
i
think
we
must
scrutinize
it
to
see
if
there's
a
rational
reason
behind
it.
and
--
and
on
this
particular
circumstance
--
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
for
the
purposes
of
the
employer
section,
yes.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
and
--
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
yes,
sir,
they
may
be
relevant
but
the
board
hasn't
dealt
with
the
question
in
this
fashion
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
that's
--
that's
one
of
the
things
i'm
saying.
yes,
sir.
and
their
lumping
them
into
this
category
with
religious,
charitable,
scientific
organizations
is
not
a
rational
--
rational
classification
because
we
come
right
back
again
to
a
congressional
intent.
i
don't
believe
we
can
ignore
the
congressional
intent
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
yes.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
on
those
kinds
of
policy
grounds,
your
honor's
position
may
be
well
taken,
but
i
think
congress
and
i
come
back
to
congressional
intent
again,
congress
indicated
that
it
wanted
unions
treated
in
the
same
fashion
as
other
employers
when
they
commit
unfair
practice
against
their
employees.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
no,
the
board
might
adopt
a
varying
standard
for
this.
i
--
i
don't
say
what
it
should
be.
i
don't
know.
i
don't
--
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
yes,
it
is
a
policy
question.
but
i
don't
think
the
policy
can
be
taken
on
one
side
and
your
eyes
can
be
blinded
to
the
congressional
intent
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
that's
my
point.
you
can't
leave
them
out
all
together.
and
that's
what
this
board
has
done
and
that
is
why
it's
arbitrary
and
wrongful
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
because
--
you
mean,
your
honor,
in
the
board
decision?
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
because
the
board
says
it
will
not
take
the
jurisdiction
over
labor
organizations
as
employers
engaged
in
trade
union
capacities.
the
board
says
that
in
its
opinion.
and
i
read
that
and
all
together
exclusion
and
that
--
that
come
back
to
the
point.
and
if
there
are
rare
cases
where
you
can
find
otherwise,
it
is
a
de
minimis
principle
that
in
effect
emasculates
this
provision
of
the
act.
that
is
the
point.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
the
only
one
--
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
yes.
i
--
i
--
that
is
--
that
question
is
raised,
your
honor,
in
the
briefs.
the
board
has
declined
its
jurisdiction
over
the
entire
hotel
industry
for
example.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
hotel
industry.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
--
and
the
taxicab
industry.
i
don't
know
of
any
others
but
it's
arguable
in
those
cases
there
is
some
congressional
intent
that
the
board
can
do
this.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
that
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
i'd
like
to
just
say
one
other
thing
before
i
sit
down.
the
board
has
suggested
here
that
this
court
remand
the
case
because
of
the
change
administrative
personnel
on
the
policy
ground
in
complying
that
since
the
two
members
of
the
board
who
decided
this
case
are
no
longer
with
the
agency
and
that
two
more
men
have
come
along
to
replace
them,
that
these
two
new
members
of
the
board
might
have
a
different
policy
view
on
this
question.
the
petitioner
has
asked
this
court
to
decide
this
question
on
the
issues
presented.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
1--
three
points.
with
reference
to
the
point
mr.
justice
douglas
was
pursuing
with
mr.
manoli
before
the
recess
as
to
the
applicability
of
section
8
(b)
in
unfair
labor
practices.
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
8
(b)
has
no
application
whatsoever
in
any
aspect
of
this
case.
8
(b)
refers
to
union
unfair
labor
practices
in
the
normal
union
activity
capacity.
8
(a)
refers
to
employers
and
it's
when
the
union
is
acting
as
an
employer,
that
is
an
entirely
different
matter
of
when
it's
committing
a
secondary
boycott
or
applying
restraint
and
coercion
to
the
employees
of
other
employers.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
it
is
--
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
--
and
that
is
the
only
thing
it's
under.
and
then
8
(b)
has
no
application
whatsoever
to
any
situations
of
this
kind.
now,
the
other
point
which
i
wanted
to
touch
on
very
briefly
is
back
again
to
section
2
(2).
mr.
justice
frankfurter
referred
to
it
and
the
others
have
too,
and
i
certainly
agree
that
2
(2)
puts
them
in.
it's
not
a
mandate,
2
(2)
has
put
them
in
the
act
and
then
we
go
to
consider
in
this
case
the
policy
reasons
as
to
how
you
would
treat
them.
now,
i
say
the
board,
when
it
considers
these
policy
reasons,
has
got
to
take
in
all
the
aspects
of
it,
and
i
say
and
fundamentally
the
board
cannot
put
on
blinkers
and
disregard
the
legislative
history
of
--
of
2
(2)
as
it
comes
to
us.
and
that
is
one
of
the
essential
factors
that
must
be
taken
into
consideration
when
you
deal
with
the
question,
the
so-called
policy
question
of
whether
or
not
you're
going
to
take
jurisdiction
over
activities
of
unions.
now,
the
question
was
also
raised
about
the
exclusion
of
some
classes
of
employers
such
as
hotels
and
taxicabs.
again,
the
same
standards
i
think
should
apply.
what
are
the
variety
of
reasons
which
support
a
sound
rational
decision?
in
those
cases,
i
think
could
be
distinguished
from
this.in
hotels
and
taxicabs,
the
board
apparently
felt
that
there
was
a
--
these
were
essentially
local
in
character,
a
rational
kind
of
finding.
but
no
such
thing
applies
to
labor
organizations
and
besides
in
hotels
and
taxicabs,
you
don't
have
the
kind
of
legislative
history
you
have
here
if
anything
you
may
deem
something
in
the
other
direction
with
regard
to
declination
of
jurisdiction
over
hotels
and
taxis.
but
here,
we
have
to
view
this
history
made
by
the
73rd
and
74th
congresses
which
indicated
that
congress
wanted
them
in
and
did
not
want
the
board
to
wipe
them
out.
i
think
it's
those
kind
of
standards
we
have
to
take
into
consideration
and
there
is
where
the
board
has
come
into
arbitrary
and
capricious
action
in
disregarding
these
basic
fundamental
elements.
thank
you.
