justice
william
o.
douglas
i
thought
that
the
issue
was
or
one
issue
at
least
was
phrased
in
terms
of
--
that
the
--
mr.
murdock
phrased
it
in
the
labor
board
whether
a
labor
organization
was
an
employer
only
when
it
was
engaging
in
commercial
activities.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
part
of
the
problem
for
us,
isn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
does
the
present
board
disagree
with
murdock?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
not
what
the
majority
said.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
--
that's
not
what
the
majority
said.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
you
said
that
the
board
felt
that
there
was
power?
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
question
whether
to
assert
it,
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
don't
you
get
into
a
lot
of
difficulty
when
you
come
to
the
portions
of
the
provisions
of
the
act
like
section
8
(a)
and
8
(b)
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
the
fact
that
the
--
that
the
congress
had
selected
out
the
unfair
labor
practices
in
8
(b)
as
respects
labor
unions
did
not
put
them
under
8
(a)
as
employers
indicates
perhaps
that
they
were
not
using
an
employer
in
the
broad
sense
in
which
the
board
has
indicated.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
now,
under
your
interpretation
would
the
--
would
the
labor
union
be
subject
to
8
(a)
justice
william
o.
douglas
in
this
case?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
it
would
be
subject
to
both
8
(a)
and
to
8
(b)?
justice
william
o.
douglas
8
(a)
describes
unfair
labor
practices
of
employers.
justice
william
o.
douglas
employer
is
defined
in
section
2
(2).
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
8
(b)
would
also
apply.
justice
william
o.
douglas
so
you
--
you
come
out
in
effect
with
a
more
rigorous
control
of
unfair
labor
practices
of
unions
and
unfair
labor
practices
of
--
of
commercial
employers?
justice
william
o.
douglas
if
you
put
them
under
both
--
both
8
(a)
and
8
(b).
justice
william
o.
douglas
has
there
been
any
case
of
that
kind?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
under
your
argument
the
labor
union
might
be
under
8
(a)
then?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
