justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but,
mr.
guthrie
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
how
did
that
become
an
issue
when
you
did
not
feel
the
question
of
the
issues
found
in
favor
of
the
railroad
were
not
an
issue
on
appeal,
were
they?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
naturally
because
the
burden
of
proof
was
upon
you
to
carry
the
risk
of
persuasion
to
the
jury
and
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
you
did
and
they
made
these
findings
in
your
favor.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
the
question
is
limited,
is
it
not
then,
to
the
findings
what
the
jury
made
in
your
favor
and
are
they
adequate
to
support
the
judgment?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
that's
limited
though
in
--
is
it
not
in
its
compass
to
whether
or
not
there
was
evidence
sufficient
to
support
the
verdict
of
the
jury
on
the
issues
they
found
in
favor
of
plaintiff?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
in
other
words,
whether
there
is
adequate
evidentiary
basis
here
to
support
the
finding
that
the
railroad
company
was
negligent
in
failing
to
furnish
proper
tools?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that's
the
issue,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
you
say
the
--
the
evidentiary
basis
is
adequate.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
your
--
your
opponent
says
the
contrary.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
that's
the
issue,
isn't
it?
