mr.
robert
lee
guthrie
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
robert
lee
guthrie
this
is
a
case
that
arises
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
it
involves
a
workman
that
was
injured
in
the
course
of
his
employment
while
working
for
the
santa
fe
railway
company
at
brownwood,
texas.
the
injury
was
sustained
on
july
the
12th,
1949.
on
that
day,
a
locomotive
was
in
the
shops
of
the
company
for
repair.
the
clerk
of
the
general
foreman
told
deen,
who
was
the
coppersmith
for
the
railway
company,
that
we
must
have
this
locomotive
out
of
the
shops
today.
now,
to
repair
the
locomotive,
it
was
necessary
to
use
babbitt
which
is
an
alloy
of
antimony,
copper,
and
tin.
the
babbitt
that
was
available
was
in
a
steel
pot
that
leaked
so
badly
that
it
put
out
the
fire
which
burned
underneath
the
pot
in
the
furnace.
now,
on
that
very
day,
the
railway
company
was
planning
to
replace
the
pot
with
a
new
one.
and
the
foreman
told
deen
that
if
he
had
that
old
pot
off
of
the
furnace
and
have
the
furnace
ready
to
be
replaced
with
a
new
pot,
that
he
could
use
the
men
that
brought
the
new
pot
to
lift
it
upon
the
furnace
and
also
to
place
the
babbitt
in
the
new
pot
for
melting.
mr.
robert
lee
guthrie
in
the
new
pot
for
melting,
in
the
new
--
new
steel
pot.
mr.
robert
lee
guthrie
now,
your
honors,
the
steel
pot
weighed
about
250
pounds.
and
the
babbitt
that
was
in
the
pot
weighed
some
550
or
600
pounds
as
i
remembered.
the
steel
pot
and
the
babbitt
together
weighed
almost
a
half
a
ton.
now,
right
beside
the
steel
pot
was
a
hoist
that
it
then
furnished
by
the
railway
company
for
the
purpose
of
lifting
heavy
object.
now,
this
steel
pot
fitted
so
snugly
in
the
furnace
that
it
was
necessary
for
deen
to
take
a
crow
bar
and
pries
it
off
to
the
furnace,
a
distance
about
half
an
--
inch-and-a-half,
so
that
it
could
be
gripped
by
the
arms
of
the
hoist
and
lift
it
from
the
furnace
onto
the
floor.
he
revolved
the
hoist
around,
fitted
the
arms
of
it
under
the
--
under
the
rim
of
the
steel
pot
which
was
a
inch-and-a-half
to
two
inches
wide,
then
he
tried
to
take
the
pot
from
the
furnace
to
the
floor
and
in
the
course
of
the
transfer,
the
steel
pot
fell
to
the
floor.
and
your
honors,
he
then
tried
to
overturn
the
steel
pot
with
the
babbitt
in
it
by
himself,
but
he
was
unable
to
do
so.
a
fellow
workman
and
a
blacksmith
in
the
shop
saw
the
difficulty
that
he
was
in
and
they
voluntarily
came
to
his
assistant,
then
both
tried
to
overturn
the
steel
pot
to
empty
out
the
babbitt
but
they
were
unable
to
do
so.
and
then
both
of
them
went
around
to
the
front
of
the
pot,
one
braced
himself
against
the
furnace,
that
was
deen,
snow
braced
himself
against
the
steel
bent
that
was
there
and
they
pulled
the
steel
pot
towards
it.
just
as
it
reached
an
upright
position,
the
babbitt
slab
out
of
the
pot,
caught
deen's
right
leg,
mangled
him
and
crippled
him
for
life.
and
the
case
was
tried
before
a
jury
in
the
state
court
at
brownwood,
texas.
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury
in
accordance
with
texas
process
on
special
issues.
now,
the
jury
in
response
to
those
special
issues
made
the
following
findings,
that
the
railway
company
did
not
furnish
deen
proper
tools
to
do
his
job,
that
this
failure
was
negligent
and
that
it
was
approximate
cause
of
deen's
injury.
the
jury
also
found
that
the
railway
company
did
not
fail
to
give
deen
proper
supervision.
they
found
that
the
railway
company
did
not
fail
to
furnish
him
sufficient
help
to
do
the
work.
that
deen's
failure
to
use
the
available
help
was
negligence
and
this
was
the
proximate
cause
of
his
injuries.
but
the
jury
also
found
that
deen
was
not
negligent
in
the
manner
and
method
that
he
used
to
do
his
work,
that
the
sole
cosmic
cause
of
his
injuries
was
not
deen's
negligence.
and
that
the
railway
could
anticipate,
could
recently
anticipate
that
deen
would
do
the
job
in
the
way
and
manner
in
which
he
did.
and
that
$39,000
would
compensate
him
for
his
injuries,
but
because
of
his
own
negligence
that
that
recovery
should
be
reduced
45%
or
$17,550
leaving
him
a
recovery
of
$21,450.
now,
your
honor,
the
trial
court
reconciled
all
of
the
findings
of
the
jury
and
rendered
judgement
in
favor
of
deen
for
$21,450.
and
that
was
the
only
judgement
that
could
be
rendered,
giving
effect
to
all
of
the
findings
of
the
jury.
now,
the
railway
company
appealed
the
case
to
the
court
of
civil
appeals
of
texas,
and
they
set
aside
the
judgement
of
the
trial
court
and
said
that
deen
should
recover
nothing.
they
didn't
even
send
the
case
back
for
a
second
trial.
and
your
honors,
in
order
for
the
court
of
civil
appeals
to
do
that
they
could
only
give
effect
to
certain
findings
of
the
jury
and
ignore
other
findings
of
the
jury.
we
say
that
the
court
of
civil
appeals
deliberately
circumvented
the
findings
of
the
jury
in
this
case.
we
say
that
the
court
of
civil
appeals
of
texas
resorted
to
certain
very
obvious
devices
in
order
to
do
this.
in
the
first
place,
they
construed
our
pleadings
strictly
against
us.
and,
your
honors,
pleadings
in
texas
are
very
liberally
construed.
and
this
is
particularly
true
after
verdict
of
the
jury
has
been
rendered.
but
in
this
case,
the
court
of
civil
appeals
strictly
construed
our
pleadings
against
us.
and
we
say
--
we
said
in
our
pleadings
that
the
injuries
which
deen
sustained,
approximately
resulting
from
the
railroad
--
approximately
resulted
jointly
and
severally
from
the
failure
of
the
railroad
to
furnish
proper
tools
and
from
the
failure
of
the
railway
to
furnish
sufficient
help
to
do
this
job.
that
is
true
that
in
another
part
of
our
pleadings
we
said
that
the
railway
company
either
failed
to
furnish
proper
tools
or
to
furnish
sufficient
help.
now,
instead
of
construing
our
pleadings
levelly,
the
court
of
civil
appeals
ceased
upon
that
allegation
where
we
said
that
it
either
ought
to
be
the
one
or
the
other.
they
said
that
put
the
burden
upon
us
to
prove
two
acts
of
negligence
in
order
to
succeed
in
the
case,
and
that
the
railway
company
only
had
to
disprove
either
proper
help,
either
sufficient
help,
or
proper
tools
in
order
to
succeed.
now,
the
second
thing
that
the
court
of
civil
appeals
did,
if
--
if
your
honors
please,
is
that
they
said
that
all
findings
that
the
jury
made
in
favor
of
the
railway
company
was
amply
supported
by
the
evidence,
whereas
no
findings
that
the
jury
made
in
favor
of
the
injured
worker
was
supported
by
the
evidence.
mr.
robert
lee
guthrie
yes,
sir?
mr.
robert
lee
guthrie
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor
--
your
honor
but
the
--
the
court
of
civil
appeals
ignored
my
findings
and
only
puts
the
findings
in
favor
of
the
railway
--
mr.
robert
lee
guthrie
yes.
mr.
robert
lee
guthrie
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
lee
guthrie
yes,
sir,
i
think
that's
correct.
i
think
that's
correct.
and
i
--
i'm
charging
the
court
of
civil
appeals
that
deliberately
circumventing
the
findings
of
the
jury.
now,
your
honors,
the
court
of
civil
appeals
of
texas
did
a
third
thing
to
get
around
this
jury
verdict.
they
made
a
finding
for
the
jury
that
the
jury
did
not
make
for
itself.
they
say
that
the
finding
of
the
jury
that
the
railway
furnished
sufficient
help
to
do
this
work,
and
that
deen
was
negligence
for
not
using
additional
help
and
they
said
this
was
the
approximate
cause
of
his
injuries.
they
construed
that
to
mean
that
the
railroad
company
had
furnished
a
safe
method
to
deen
to
do
this
job,
and
therefore,
since
they
had
furnished
him
one
safe
method
that
they
didn't
have
to
furnish
him
another.
but
the
jury
didn't
say
that,
your
honor,
and
we
didn't
plead
our
case
that
way.
we
said
that
both
proper
tools
and
sufficient
help
were
necessary
to
do
the
job
safely.
and
if
there's
going
to
be
any
implied
findings
made
which
can
--
which
it
can
be
made
in
support
of
the
jury
verdict,
those
implied
findings
have
to
be
consistent
with
the
findings
that
the
jury
made
and
consistent
with
the
theory
upon
which
the
case
was
tried
in
the
trial
court.
those
implied
findings
are
made
by
the
trial
judge
and
not
by
the
court
of
civil
appeals.
now,
your
honor,
the
court
of
civil
appeals
in
construing
that
this
was
a
safe
--
that
the
jury
finding
of
sufficient
help
was
a
safe
method
of
doing
this
job
meant
that
the
court
of
civil
appeals
found
that
the
railway
company
furnished
a
safe
method
to
do
the
job
when
the
railroad
company
itself
plead
that
they
didn't
furnish
deen
any
method
to
do
the
job.
they
said
that
he
himself
selected
his
own
method
and
if
there's
any
negligence
in
the
way
he
did
it
then
that
it
was
deen's
own
negligence.
and
that
they
didn't
give
him
any
instructions
at
all.
but
even
though
the
railway
company
plead
that
they
didn't
furnish
him
any
method
for
doing
the
work,
the
court
of
civil
appeals
found
that
they
furnished
him
a
safe
method
for
doing
it.
now
furthermore,
your
honors,
the
position
of
the
railway
company
in
the
trial
court
was
that
this
accident
would
have
happened
no
matter
how
many
men
that
you
had
there
at
the
time
of
the
injury.
that
when
you
raise
the
steel
pot
in
upright
position
that
the
babbitt
was
going
to
slip
out
as
a
whole
--
a
whole
shop
had
been
there,
and
deen
said
it
might
have
fallen
on
two
ovens
instead
of
one
if
more
workers
have
been
there.
but
even
though
the
railway
company
took
that
position
in
the
trial
court,
the
court
of
civil
appeals
says
that
the
evidence
was
sufficient
to
show
that
they
had
furnished
him
a
safe
method
to
do
the
work
because
they
furnished
him
enough
help
to
do
it.
so
if
the
court
of
civil
appeals'
decision,
your
honor,
resulted
in
the
court
of
civil
appeals
construing
the
evidence
more
favorably
to
deen
than
the
railroad
itself
construe
the
evidence.
now,
is
it
a
travesty
on
justice
that
deen
is
told
by
the
court
of
civil
appeals
to
limp
through
life
without
any
compensation
because
of
a
fact
that
the
railway
company
said
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
accident?
mr.
robert
lee
guthrie
if
the
court
please.
i
don't
understand
the
practice
at
all
like
the
railway
company
argues,
and
i
think
that's
just
camouflaged
to
try
to
conceal
from
this
court
that
the
jury
found
in
favor
of
this
plaintiff.
now,
your
honor,
the
--
we
use
the
special
issues
instead
of
the
general
charge.
but
instead
of
telling
the
jury
in
general
language
that
you
must
--
that
you
must
find
whether
the
--
the
plaintiff
committed
a
certain
act
or
the
defendant
committed
a
certain
act
and
whether
this
is
negligence
and
whether
that
is
a
proximate
cause.
instead
of
telling
them
in
the
general
charge
like
you
would
in
the
federal
court,
you
simply
ask
those
questions
that
way
insofar
as
construing
the
verdict
of
the
jury
of
rendering
judgment,
it's
not
like
it's
different
for
what
it
is
in
the
federal
court.
now,
your
honors,
we
did
not
simply
--
we
did
not
at
any
time
plead
that
manual
labor
would
be
a
safe
way
of
doing
this
work.
if
you
look
on
page
6
of
the
record,
about
the
middle
of
the
page,
you'll
see
that
we
pled
that
injuries
herein
set
forth
resulting
to
the
plaintiff
were
the
direct
and
proximate
result
jointly
and
severally
of
the
negligent
acts
of
the
defendant
in
the
following
respect.
and
then
look
at
(d)
which
is
the
--
no,
it's
(c),
look
at
(c)
that
the
defendant
was
negligent
in
not
furnishing
plaintiff
with
proper
tools
and
then
(d)
that
it's
negligent
in
not
furnishing
at
least
two
additional
men
to
assist
the
plaintiff.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
lee
guthrie
sir?
mr.
robert
lee
guthrie
yes,
sir,
but
they
found
the
proper
tools
for
us,
your
honor.
now,
we
--
the
--
the
tools
that
we
say
we
were
entitled
to
is
at
the
--
the
hoist
which
was
furnished
for
the
railway
should
be
so
equipped
that
--
that
when
it
lifted
the
steel
pot
with
the
babbitt
off
the
furnace
and
that
it
could
turn
it
over
itself
rather
than
have
manual
labor
to
do
it.
now,
the
blacksmith
for
the
railway
company
said
he
could
have
made
the
clamps
right
there
in
his
own
blacksmith
shop,
they
could
have
been
fitted
on
the
pot
and
permitted
it
to
be
turned
over.
deen
said
it
should
be
done
one
in
--
in
parts
of
his
evidence
he
appears
to
testify
that
it
might
be
dangerous
but
he
explained
that
later
and
said
that
when
he
said
it
would
be
dangerous
he
meant
that
if
the
clamps
were
not
securely
fastened
to
the
pot
that
it
would
be
dangerous.
and
so,
your
honor,
there
were
issues
of
fact
on
--
on
proper
tool.
now,
this
exact
question
had
come
before
the
--
the
court
of
civil
appeals
of
texas
in
1928
and
it
involved
the
hoist
just
like
this
did,
an
inexperienced
in
a
--
workers
for
the
railway
company
this
was
a
hoist
that
was
used
to
lift
the
timber
on
the
railroad.
they
had
two
chains
that
came
down
from
the
hoist
and
chains
would
fit
on
each
side
of
the
timber.
and
one
of
the
chains
slipped
and
the
man
--
the
timber
fell
and
struck
the
injured
workman
in
his
back.
the
railway
company
used
the
same
defense
there
that
it
did
in
this
case,
they
said
the
--
in
our
case
he
ought
not
to
have
stuck
his
leg
in
the
way
of
the
falling
babbitt.
in
that
case
they
said
that
the
man
ought
not
to
have
stood
in
the
way
of
the
falling
timber.
but
anyway,
a
fellow
workman
in
that
case
said
that
if
the
hoist
had
been
equipped
with
the
chain
at
the
top
with
a
--
a
ring
at
the
top
so
that
the
chain
couldn't
have
slipped,
that
the
accident
couldn't
have
happened.
now,
the
railway
company
in
that
case,
your
honor,
put
on
the
evidence
as
to
--
scientific
evidence
which
they
said
would
show
that
this
chain
could
not
be
--
that
this
ring
could
not
be
used
and
it
was
not
a
proper
way
of
doing
it.
mr.
robert
lee
guthrie
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
lee
guthrie
i
don't
think
there
is.
mr.
robert
lee
guthrie
i
don't
think
there
is.
mr.
robert
lee
guthrie
i
don't
think
there
is.
mr.
robert
lee
guthrie
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
lee
guthrie
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
lee
guthrie
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
lee
guthrie
is
adequate,
yes,
sir.
mr.

of

they
--
they
put
an
alternate
question
thereto,
if
the
court
please.
they
--
they
say
that
--
that
under
the
jury
findings
of
sufficient
help
that
there
was
a
safe
method
to
do
the
work
and
that
they
didn't
have
to
furnish
two
safe
methods.
but
i
don't
think
that's
correct
because
we
didn't
plead
it
that
way
despite
the
way
we
see
it.
i
thank
you
very
much.
