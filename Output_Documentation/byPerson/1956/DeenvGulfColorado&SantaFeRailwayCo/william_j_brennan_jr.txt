justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
will
you
tell
me,
how
are
we
to
read
this
determination
as
a
finding
of
contributory
negligence
as
a
matter
of
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
i
don't
follow
that.
it
doesn't
say
that
there
was
a
finding
that
sufficient
men
were
furnished.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
says
that
sufficient
men
were
available.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
it
does
say
if
it
does
not
include
a
finding
that
the
babbitt
could
have
been
thus
removed
with
reasonable
safety,
we
need
only
to
further
determine
whether
the
record
shows
that
if
deen
had
used
sufficient
help,
the
babbitt
could
have
been
manually
removed
with
reasonable
safety.
it
is
undisputed
that
several
times
recently
before
deen's
injury,
he,
with
sufficient
help,
had
manually
removed
the
babbitt
without
injury.
deen
pleaded
that
it
was
the
company's
duty
to
either
furnish
tools
or
additional
help
and
the
jury
found
that
additional
help
was
furnished
and
deen
was
negligent
in
not
using
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
why
isn't
that
a
finding
of
contributory
negligence
as
a
matter
of
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
all
right,
as
a
matter
of
fact
whatever
it
is,
it
was
a
--
it
was
a
finding
not
that
the
company
was
not
negligent
but
that
deen's
negligence
was
the
sole
cause
of
his
injury,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it's
--
well,
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
determinations
are
not
turned
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
are
they
on
intricacies
of
state
practice
or
even
on
issue
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
say,
determinations
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
are
not
made
upon
state
procedural
niceties
nor
indeed
on
state
laws
to
negligence
or
contributory
negligence
of
causation,
are
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
understand
that.
my
--
my
difficulty
is
in
reading
either
the
findings
or
what
this
court
of
appeals
has
said
as
apparently
you
read
them
and
tell
us
we
should
read
them.
in
other
words,
as
a
finding
that
there
was
no
negligence
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
plain
thing
which
means
anything,
the
findings
both
of
the
jury
and
as
pleaded
by
the
court
of
appeal
is
that
deen
was
guilty
of
negligence
as
a
matter
of
law
and
doesn't
mean
anything
more
than
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
that's
where
i
--
but
i'm
telling
you
my
difficulty.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
might
--
i'm
not
sure
whether
my
notes
are
inaccurate
but
i
think
they
are.
summary
of
the
jury
findings,
they
start
out
with
the
first
one,
that
the
respondent
failed
to
furnish
petitioner
with
proper
tool.
the
second
is
that
such
failure
was
negligence
and
the
third
approximate
cause
of
the
petitioner's
injury.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
they
pick
up
what
to
me
all
relate
to
contributory
negligence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
fourth
one
is
that
respondent
did
not
fail
to
furnish
one
or
more
men
in
addition
to
the
one
who
assisted
the
petitioner,
that
the
respondent
did
not
fail
to
give
proper
supervision
of
the
petitioner,
that
petitioner's
failure
and
--
or
negligence
in
failing
to
obtain
additional
men
that
--
was
a
proximate
cause
that
he
was
not
negligent
in
the
manner
and
method
he
used,
that
the
respondent
and
its
supervisory
employee
should
have
reasonably
anticipated
that
he
would
do
it
the
way
he
attempted
to
do
it,
that
the
sole
proximate
cause
of
his
injury
was
not
due
to
his
own
acts,
and
therefore
that
finding
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
employer
and
contributory
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
--
of
deen,
they
--
as
the
statute
requires
him
to
do,
evaluate
the
two
and
arrived
at
the
result
they
did.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
--
at
least
i
have
great
difficulty
in
reading
neither
the
findings
or
what
the
court
says
in
relation
to
a
failure
to
furnish
one
or
more
men
as
dealing
with
anything
except
the
issue
of
contributory
negligence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
was
that
what
they
found?
well,
as
i
read
it,
they
found
that
respondent
did
not
fail
to
furnish
one
or
more
men
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
addition
to
the
one
who
assisted
the
petitioner.
but
is
there
anywhere,
either
in
the
injury
finding
or
the
court
of
appeals
finding,
if
there
is
would
you
point
it
out
to
me,
an
affirmative
finding
that
the
respondent
did
furnish
adequate
help.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
were
available
but
does
that
say
that
they
were
furnished,
affirmatively
that
they
were
furnished?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
he
didn't
as
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
think
you
want
to
know
what's
on
my
mind
that
what
he
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
think
--
what's
on
my
mind
is
this.
i
have
great
difficulty,
certainly
they
were
all
there
and
had
he
called
upon
them,
perhaps
this
accident
would
never
have
occurred.
but
the
finding
is
that
they
were
there
but
he
didn't
call
upon
them
and
that
--
in
that
calling
upon
them
he
himself
was
guilty
of
negligence
for
which
the
jury
diminished
the
verdict
to
which
he
was
otherwise
entitled
by
45%.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
isn't
your
difficulty
--
i
don't
think
of
the
name
of
the
case
but
hasn't
this
court
already
said
that
in
actions
under
this
act,
we're
not
going
to
be
concerned
with
these
intricacies
and
technicalities
of
state
pleading?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
problem
of
a
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
--
but
right
after
the
court
says
that
there
was
a
finding
that
sufficient
men
were
available,
then
he
goes
on
to
say,
"we
need
only
to
further
determine
whether
the
record
shows
that
if
deen
had
used
sufficient
help,
the
babbitt
could
have
been
manually
removed
to
a
reasonable
safety."
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
isn't
that
related
to
deen's
own
action?
in
other
words,
the
contributory
negligence
with
which
you
charge
him
in
defense
and
which
the
jury
found
he
had
in
fact?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
mr.
justice
douglas.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
actually
all
these
other
available
workers
were
there
because
they
were
doing
other
jobs.
they
were
not
there
to
do
any
job
for
deen
were
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
on
--
on
previous
occasions,
i
gather,
when
this
thing
had
been
done,
he
was
the
one
who
would
call
upon
these
others,
was
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
in
this
instance,
he
didn't
call
upon
them.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
they
were
there
for
any
purpose
of
doing
--
helping
him
to
do
his
job,
at
least
the
railroad
didn't
assign
them
there
for
that
purpose
did
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
how
could
possibly
they
--
the
finding
that
the
railroad
had
furnished
the
man
to
do
the
job
if
they
didn't
even
know
he
was
going
to
do
the
job?
