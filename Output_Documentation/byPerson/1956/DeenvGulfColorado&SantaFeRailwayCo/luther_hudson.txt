mr.
luther
hudson
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
here
to
do
two
things.
one
is
to
defend
the
decision
of
the
court
of
civil
appeals
in
this
case
and
the
other
is
to
answer
the
questions
to
the
best
of
my
ability.
the
court
asked
me
questions
about
this
court's
jurisdiction
or
to
the
extent
with
which
the
--
this
court
can
supervise
state
court
practice,
you'll
only
find
out
that
i'm
pretty
ignorant
of
that.
that
i
--
my
knowledge
of
that
is
very
superficial
and
you'll
get
a
layman's
opinion.
i
think
having
tried
this
case
in
the
trial
court,
having
the
brief
in
the
court
of
civil
appeals
in
the
supreme
court
of
texas
and
having
written
the
brief
here,
i
think
i
am
familiar
with
the
record.
i
think
that
i'd
like
to
defend
the
court
of
civil
appeals'
opinion
on
the
three
grounds
that
the
court
there
gave.
those
three
grounds
were
these.
we
start
of
with
the
fundamentals
of
master
and
servant
law,
that
is
that
the
employer's
duty
is
to
furnish
a
reasonably
safe
way
to
do
the
work.
there
are
others
but
that's
the
one
that's
here.
now,
in
this
case
the
charge
and
in
spite
of
mr.
guthrie's
statement,
there
is
no
question
but
the
pleadings
in
this
case
were
in
line
with
what
i'm
about
to
say.
the
charge
that
we
should
have
furnished
a
reasonably
safe
way
to
do
the
work
were
that
we
should
have
furnished
adequate
help
to
do
the
work
with
safety
or
adequate
tools
to
do
the
work
with
safety.
their
pleadings
recognize
that
it
was
no
duty
to
furnish
two
ways
to
do
the
work
in
safety.
there
is
no
duty
on
the
master
to
furnish
several
safe
ways.
in
this
case,
the
jury
--
the
jury
found
that
we
furnished
adequate
help.
now,
there
was
no
tools
furnished.
there
was
no
--
there
was
--
wasn't
a
way
that
the
railroad
furnished.
this
work
had
been
done
before,
deen
had
done
it
before
and
he
had
always
done
it
manually
with
adequate
help.
on
this
occasion
he
chose
not
to
get
the
help.
the
help
was
available
and
the
jury
found
it
was
available.
he
could
have
done
it
safely
with
the
means
provided
by
the
employer.
the
employer
furnished
a
reasonably
safe
means
to
do
the
work.
now,
i'm
going
to
have
to
come
back
to
that,
but
i
want
to
state
my
three
points
if
i
may.
the
second
point
that
the
court
of
civil
appeals
held
against
the
petitioner
was
that
having
by
his
pleadings
alleged
that
we
had
the
duty
of
furnishing
either
adequate
help
to
do
the
work
in
safety
or
sufficient
tools,
he
had
the
burden
of
proving
that
we
didn't
either.
now,
that's
in
accordance
with
our
texas
rules
of
pleading
that
are
applicable
to
all
civil
cases.
and
since
they
found
that
we
furnished
adequate
help,
he
hadn't
sustained
the
burden
of
his
pleadings
and
consequently
the
jury
verdict
was
in
favor
of
the
defendant.
the
third
reason
was
that
under
the
record
in
the
case,
there
was
no
evidence
of
negligence
in
failing
to
furnish
sufficient
tool.
now,
if
i
may
come
back
and
take
those
in
that
order,
this
was
not
a
steel
pot
as
mr.
guthrie
said,
it
was
a
cast
iron
pot.
and
for
some
reason
or
rather
when
the
petitioner
printed
the
record,
the
pictures
which
were
there
to
--
would
show
the
situation
were
not
printed,
and
with
mr.
guthrie's
permission
i
put
two
of
them
in
the
back
of
my
brief,
and
i
think
with
one
picture
is
worth
at
least
5000
of
the
lawyer's
word
and
you
can
see
the
situation
by
looking
at
the
pictures
in
the
pocket
part
of
the
pale
green
brief.
there
are
two
pictures
there
and
i'll
wait
a
second
to
let
the
court
--
there
are
two
pictures.
one
of
them
is
a
picture
of
a
man
holding
up
this
cast
iron
pot.
the
man
is
snow
who
was
the
witness
in
the
case
and
the
man
that
was
helping
deen
when
he
was
hurt.
he
is
holding
it
up
and
the
slab
of
babbitt
is
in
front
of
it.
now,
that's
the
old
pot.
now,
just
to
the
right
is
the
--
what
you
call
a
babbitt
furnace.
the
hole
in
the
bottom
of
the
pot
is
not
a
drain,
this
thing
looks
a
whole
lot
like
a
kitchen
sink,
old
fashion
kitchen
sink
without
a
drain.
that's
what
a
babbitt
pot
is,
a
little
deeper
and
a
little
longer
but
it
looked
like
a
kitchen
sink.
that's
not
a
drain,
that's
a
crack
that
had
been
in
the
pot
for
some
time
and
that
was
the
reason
that
it
had
to
be
replaced.
now,
a
babbitt
pot
lasts
indefinitely,
i
think
the
record
in
this
case
will
support
the
statement
that
it
lasts
five
or
ten
years,
and
this
wasn't
something
that
had
to
be
done
everyday.
now,
looking
at
the
other
picture
which
is
exhibit
5
and
most
of
these
pictures
were
identified
by
the
plaintiff
himself,
you
will
see
the
picture
of
the
so-called
babbitt
furnace
with
a
new
pot
in
it.
that
is
the
way
it
looked
before
deen
took
it
on
and
put
it
on
the
floor.
just
to
the
right
of
the
furnace
itself
is
the
babbitt
pot
on
the
floor
and
the
slab
of
--
of
babbitt
in
front
of
it.
now,
this
is
as
obvious
there,
this
is
just
a
--
a
gas
--
a
fired
pot
in
which
they
keep
babbitt
and
they
heat
it
up
and
melt
it.
i
think
deen
testified
that
it
was
kept
hot
all
the
time
when
the
shop
was
going.
in
that
second
picture
there
is
a
post,
it
looked
silver
there
and
to
that
was
attached
this
hoist
that
was
used
primarily
to
raise
and
lower
a
different
piece
or
pieces
of
equipment
into
the
babbitt
pot,
it
wasn't
put
there
to
raise
the
babbitt
pot
out,
it
was
to
raise
and
lower
things
in
it
where
there'd
be
babbitt
in
it.
this
--
what
deen
was
doing,
he'd
gotten
that
babbitt
pot
out
and
he
got
it
on
the
floor.
and
it
happened
that
that
crack
in
there
had
been
discovered
some
three
or
four
weeks
before
and
he
had
taken
the
pot
out,
dumped
the
babbitt,
brazed
the
crack,
put
it
back
in,
put
the
babbitt
back
in
and
at
that
time
ordered
a
pot.
it
was
two
or
three
weeks
to
get
in
there
and
during
that
time
he
had
to
take
the
pot
out
and
brazed
the
crack
--
at
least
three
times
by
recollection.
on
those
occasions
he
did
it
just
like
he
did
this
time
with
one
exception.
on
those
occasions,
he
got
five
or
six
men
to
help
him.
this
occasion
he
got
no
one
to
help
him
until
snow
came
over
and
started
helping
him.
now,
he
got
this
babbitt
pot
on
the
floor,
this
cast
iron
pot
on
the
floor.
mr.
guthrie
said
it
fell,
that
did.
it
couldn't
have
fallen
more
than
three
of
four
inches.
it
started
lowering
it
and
got
it
down
and
drop
three
or
four
inches.
snow,
who
is
in
the
same
room
when
it
--
didn't
even
hear
it
fall,
but
that
doesn't
matter
because
of
the
fact
that
the
babbitt
pot
landed
exactly
where
he
wanted
it
if
he'd
lowered
it,
it
would
have
been
right
there,
that's
where
he
testified,
it
was
where
he
wanted
it.
nobody
was
injured
then.
it
was
ready
for
the
new
pot.
now,
deen
is
a
good
man
and
instead
of
waiting
until
the
storeroom
crew
showed
up
with
the
--
a
new
pot,
he
started
to
turn
it
over
and
it's
too
heavy
for
him,
so
snow
came
over
and
they
gave
it
a
pull.
now,
there's
nothing
complicated,
it
couldn't
be
anything
more
simple
than
dumping
an
oblong
butter
pot.
we've
all
dumped
(inaudible)
or
hoist
it
up,
you
just
get
hold
of
it
and
come
over
with
it
and
she
pops
over
and
once
in,
runs
out.
now,
that's
just
what
he
was
doing.
actually
in
this
particular
time,
he
tried
to
turn
it
away
from
him
as
he
had
done
when
he
had
adequate
help.
in
which
case
the
--
of
course
the
--
the
babbitt
pot
falls
away
from
him
and
doesn't
landed
on
his
leg.
but
because
they're
only
two
there
they
had
to
get
hold
of
it,
and
i
have
stepped
back
a
little
bit
to
show
the
position,
except
i
believe
it
was
this
way.
they
got
back
and
pulled
it
with
this
hand
and
came
over
like
that.
i'm
getting
a
little
high
but
not
like
this.
and
just
as
it
got
upright,
deen
said,
“watch
out
for
your
toes.”
almost
instantaneously
the
slab
of
babbitt
came
out
which
is
what
he
was
trying
to
accomplish
and
fell
on
his
leg
because
his
leg
was
in
front
of
it.
now,
that's
the
lawsuit.
that's
the
lawsuit
until
we
get
to
try
it
before
a
jury.
now,
in
texas
you
try
all
civil
cases
on
special
issues.
special
issues
are
questions.
the
special
issues
are
formed
from
the
pleadings
of
the
parties.
the
plaintiff
by
his
pleading
sets
the
language
in
which
these
special
issues
will
be
submitted
on
primary
liability.
the
defendant
by
his
pleading
sets
the
form
or
the
language
in
which
the
issues
will
be
submitted
on
--
in
defense,
the
defensive
issues.
the
court
has
to
submit
them
the
way
they're
pled
in
other
words.
and
that's
what
the
court
did
in
this
case.
they
submitted
them
in
his
language.
now,
the
bitter
attack
in
this
case
on
the
court
of
civil
appeals
is
the
decision
of
the
court
of
civil
appeals
which
appears
at
page
181
of
the
record
and
since
that
is
the
principal
attack
and
without
that
he
gets
nowhere
i
think.
i'm
going
to
take
--
it
starts
at
the
bottom
of
180,
the
actual
language
at
the
top
of
181.
and
this
is
the
court
of
civil
appeals'
holding,
“as
heretofore
shown,
the
jury
found
the
railroad
company
did
not
fail
to
furnish
more
men
to
assist
deen
in
removing
the
babbitt.
that
it
did
not
fail
to
give
deen
proper
supervision
at
the
time
of
the
inquiry.
that
deen
was
negligent
in
failing
to
obtain
additional
help
to
remove
the
babbitt
and
that
such
negligence
was
the
proximate
cause
of
his
injury.
we
think
said
answers
considered
in
connection
with
the
record
must
be
construed
as
a
finding
that
sufficient
men
were
available
to
help
deen
remove
the
babbitt
with
safety.”
now,
that's
what
the
court
of
civil
appeals
construed
this
jury
verdict
has
been.
i've
got
to
go
back
and
explain
another
thing.
i
--
i'm
accused
by
petitioner
here
of
having
trying
to
initiate
this
court
into
the
intricacies
of
texas
special
issue
practice.
and
i
either
had
to
put
it
in
my
brief
or
rely
on
mr.
justice
clark's
recollection
and
i
thought
it's
safer
to
put
it
in
the
briefs.
that
will
excuse
some
of
the
things
that
are
in
here.
now,
what
happens
when
you
get
a
special
issue
verdict
in
texas
is
that
under
our
rules,
the
court,
trial
court
renders
judgment
as
is
required
and
this
is
a
rule
that's
quoted
in
the
substance
as
is
required
by
the
jury's
findings,
the
pleadings
in
evidence.
it
has
to
conform
to
all
three.
now,
the
trial
court,
i
made
a
motion
for
judgment
on
the
verdict,
so
did
the
plaintiff.
i
made
a
judgment
on
a
motion
for
staying
a
judgment
on
the
verdict
or
disregarding
issues
one,
two,
and
three
which
were
the
--
two
of
the
issues.
the
trial
court
heard
them
and
he
said
that
the
verdict
was
for
the
plaintiff.
now,
that's
what
we
appealled
from.
that
was
what
the
appeal
to
the
court
of
civil
appeals
was.
that
decision
by
the
trial
court
is
reviewable
on
appeal.
the
court
of
civil
appeals
took
those
findings
in
light
of
the
pleadings
and
evidence
and
said
that
that
verdict
was
the
one
for
the
defendant.
mr.
luther
hudson
no,
sir,
a
finding
of
no
negligence.
mr.
luther
hudson
yes,
sir.
mr.
luther
hudson
yes,
sir.
mr.
luther
hudson
yes,
sir.
mr.
luther
hudson
that's
right.
mr.
luther
hudson
it's
--
no,
sir,
it's
not
a
finding
of
contributory
negligent
as
a
matter
of
law.
it's
a
finding
of
contributory
negligence
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
luther
hudson
no,
sir.
i
--
if
i
can
explain
--
mr.
luther
hudson
yes,
sir.
i
--
i
don't
want
to
--
mr.
luther
hudson
i'm
--
i'm
sorry,
sir,
i
missed
the
first
part
of
that
question.
mr.
luther
hudson
no,
sir.
can
i
--
can
i
explain
how
that
--
how
does
--
how
the
state
practice
fits
into
this
picture?
it
fits
in
just
with
the
question
you
asked
me
first.
the
--
the
jury
answered
to
issue
number
four,
if
my
memory
is
correct,
that
the
defendant
did
not
fail
to
furnish
two
additional
men.
now,
that
is
the
finding
which
the
court
in
the
light
of
the
record
and
the
pleadings
says
was
a
finding
that
the
defendant
furnished
adequate
help
to
do
the
work
with
reasonable
safety
and
that
is
--
mr.
luther
hudson
no,
sir.
i
tell
you
--
mr.
luther
hudson
--
that's
--
that's
where
i
get
--
mr.
luther
hudson
that's
where
i
get
involved
in
this
special
issue
business.
that's
where
we
get
into
that.
here,
you
start
off
with
this
premise
that
the
master
has
the
duty
to
furnish
a
reasonable
safe
way
to
do
the
work
and
that
a
jury
has
a
right
to
find
that
it
did
or
it
didn't
under
certain
circumstances.
if
the
jury
found
that
we
furnished
enough
men
to
do
the
work
with
reasonable
safety,
then
we
furnished
a
man
a
reasonably
safe
way
to
do
the
work.
we
didn't
furnish
in
two
ways,
your
honor.
mr.
luther
hudson
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
luther
hudson
no,
sir.
mr.
luther
hudson
no,
sir.
i
--
if
you
read
the
pleadings
in
the
case,
we
don't
follow
the
same
practice
they
do
in
the
federal
court
with
reference
to
pleadings.
we
are
required
to
allege
in
detail,
it
saves
having
to
go
through
interrogatories,
request
for
admissions
in
pretrial
hearings
while
we
go
by
the
pleading.
i
try
on
both
courts,
one
week
in
one
and
one
to
the
other
and
sometimes
it
get
mixed
up.
but
this
particular
situation,
the
pleadings
alleged
that
we
were
negligent
in
not
furnishing
him
a
safe
way
to
do
the
work
either
by
furnishing
him
adequate
tools
or
sufficient
help.
now,
that
was
the
charge
of
negligence.
there
was
another
charge
of
negligence
with
reference
supervision
to
which
the
jury
found
against
him.
now,
but
getting
back
to
your
--
the
essence
of
it
is,
your
honor,
that
the
obligation
on
the
defendant
was
to
furnish
a
reasonably
safe
way
to
do
the
work.
he
said
we
didn't
do
it
because
we
didn't
give
him
enough
help
and
if
he
didn't
have
the
help
he
needed
tools.
the
jury
found
that
we
did
furnish
him
adequate
help.
mr.
luther
hudson
yes,
sir.
mr.
luther
hudson
yes,
sir.
i
think
the
--
what
i
read
there,
i
read
it
again.
we
think
said
answers
are
considered
in
connection
with
the
record
must
be
construed
as
a
finding
that
sufficient
men
were
available
to
help
deen
remove
the
babbitt
with
safety.
mr.
luther
hudson
well,
i
don't
quarrel
with
your
honor
about
the
difference
between
available
and
furnished.
they
--
the
record
shows
they
were
within
half
a
block
that
they
have
been
furnished
to
him
before.
all
he
had
to
do
is
go
ask
for
them.
mr.
luther
hudson
i
mean
they
weren't
--
they
weren't
forced
on
him,
your
honor.
mr.
luther
hudson
yes,
sir,
that's
what
i'm
here
for.
mr.
luther
hudson
your
honor,
what
you
got
to
understand
to
understand
my
position
and
the
position
the
court
of
civil
appeals
as
second
nature
to
us
in
the
state
court
that
you
see
i
couldn't
get
an
issue
worded,
do
you
find
from
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
the
defendant
furnished
sufficient
number
of
help
to
do
the
work
with
reasonable
safety?
i
couldn't
get
that
issue
because
the
plaintiff
had
formulated
the
issue
on
adequate
help
by
his
pleadings
and
they
could
only
submit
it
in
the
form
that
plaintiff
had
alleged
it.
they
can't
submit
it
affirmatively
and
negatively
in
texas
practice.
they
submitted
once
and
that's
all.
therefore,
when
they
submitted
once
and
they
find
it
against
him,
although
in
your
mind
it
is
a
negative
finding,
in
our
practice
it
is
an
affirmative
finding
that
adequate
help
was
furnished
to
do
the
work
in
safety.
mr.
luther
hudson
well
--
mr.
luther
hudson
this
--
i'm
sure
you
have.
i
--
the
brown
case
is
one
of
them,
that's
the
one
where
the
georgia
statute
as
i
remembered
that
threw
the
man
out
on
his
pleadings
himself.
this
man
--
i
thought
the
rule
was
and
i
say
i'm
a
layman
on
this
point.
i
thought
the
rule
was
if
the
state
practice
didn't
constitute
an
unreasonable
obstacle
to
the
man
getting
a
fair
trial,
the
state
could
have
his
own
practice
and
i
thought
that
was
the
rule,
but
as
i
say
i'm
a
layman
on
that
point
and
i
wouldn't
ask
the
court
to
do
more
than
checking.
anyway,
i
still
--
your
honors
got
your
finger
on
the
very
--
very
heart
of
the
case.
the
determination
by
the
court
of
civil
appeals
that
this
was
a
jury
finding
that
adequate
help
was
available
and,
your
honor,
there
is
no
difference
between
furnished
and
available.
it
hasn't
--
you
don't
have
force
it
on
the
man.
he
--
it
was
there,
all
he
had
to
do
is
ask
for
it.
now,
if
he
goes
ahead
voluntarily,
do
it
another
way,
that
is
not
a
violation
of
the
defendant's
duties.
if
you
--
mr.
luther
hudson
yes,
sir.
mr.
luther
hudson
no,
sir,
because
of
this
proposition.
that
the
employer
is
only
obligated
to
furnish
one
safe
way
to
do
the
work,
you
don't
have
to
furnish
four.
your
honor
wrote
an
opinion
in
--
in
--
i'm
awful
bad
on
stuff,
ferguson,
i
believe
it
was,
with
reference
to
a
man
shipping
some
ice
cream
where
they
--
where
the
--
didn't
you
--
your
honor
--
mr.
luther
hudson
well,
then
mr.
justice
douglas
may
remember
in
that
case
the
--
there
was
a
showing
that
on
other
ships
they
used
ice
chipper
to
get
the
ice
cream
out,
it
could
be
done
with
safety.
now,
just
to
prove
it
is
to
get
my
point
with
mr.
justice
brennan
over,
in
that
case
it
didn't
furnish
him
any
ice
chipper.
he
had
to
go
and
get
it
out
with
a
knife.
now,
had
they
furnished
him
an
ice
chipper
in
that
case
and
it
was
standing
right
there
where
it
was
available
to
him
and
they
would
have
furnished
him
a
safe
way
to
do
the
work.
and
he
--
they
would
not
have
been
negligent
if
he
went
and
preferred
to
use
a
knife
to
reduce
it
to
absurdity
if
they
furnished
him
one
safe
way
to
with
one
ice
chipper
where
they're
negligent
and
not
furnishing
him
two,
if
not
two
then
not
three.
the
--
the
obligation
on
the
master,
the
obligation
to
the
employer
to
the
servant
is
to
furnish
a
safe
way
to
do
the
work,
get
him
adequate
supervision.
the
jury
found
those
two
things
in
our
favor,
that's
why
we
say
it's
a
jury
verdict
for
the
defendant.
now,
the
--
mr.
luther
hudson
no,
sir.
mr.
luther
hudson
they
were
--
they
were
there
--
they
were
there,
the
records
--
now,
there
where
we
got
a
jury
finding
of
judgment.
i
mean
the
question
--
let's
just
say
the
jury
could
have
found
they
weren't
available.
mr.
luther
hudson
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
luther
hudson
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
luther
hudson
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
supervisory
employees
did
not
know
when
he
testified.
they
didn't
know
that
he
was
going
to
do
the
job
at
that
particular
time.
mr.
luther
hudson
well,
the
--
the
point
is,
your
honor,
there
--
the
way
they
operate
there,
there's
bull
gang
they
call
in.
that's
a
labor
gang.
it
is
available
to
help
people
anytime
they
got
heavy
jobs.
now,
sometimes
they
have
--
sometimes
they're
over
here
and
sometimes
they're
over
there
and
you
have
to
walk
a
half
a
block
to
get
them,
but
they're
available.
they
don't
--
they
don't
have
enough
men
in
a
shop
of
that
kind
and
they
can't
have
enough
men
to
have
five
people
standing
along
side
every
man
when
he
needs
it.
but
i
say
you
have
--
i'll
admit
i'm
used
to
it.
i've
been
doing
it
for
23
years
in
special
issues.
texas
law
special
issues
are
simple
to
me
and
it's
simple
to
the
court
of
civil
appeals
down
there.
now,
you
say
about
intricacies
of
--
of
practice.
the
point
is
--
the
only
place
you
get
into
intricacies
of
texas
practice
is
whether
or
not
the
court
had
a
right
to
construe
that
finding
as
a
finding
of
furnishing
a
reasonably
safe
way
to
do
the
work.
now,
if
i'm
wrong
about
the
law
of
employer
and
--
master
and
servant,
that
there
is
an
obligation
on
the
employer
to
furnish
two
or
three
safe
ways,
then
we
get
on
to
the
question
of
whether
the
evidence
supported
a
finding
of
negligence
in
failing
to
furnish
this
tool.
but
if
i'm
right
that
the
only
obligation
on
the
employer
is
to
furnish
one
safe
way
and
that
the
jury
finding
was
a
finding
that
they
furnished
him
a
reasonably
safe
way
to
do
the
work
then
there
is
a
complete
discharge
of
the
duty
and
therefore
no
negligence.
now,
that's
where
i
say
there's
no
negligence,
your
honor.
mr.
luther
hudson
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
luther
hudson
i
don't
remember
it
by
a
number
judge
--
mr.
luther
hudson
yes,
sir,
that's
--
excuse
me.
that's
a
finding
that
they
would
expect
him
to
do
it
manually
by
hand.
that
is
a
finding
that
they
would
expect
him
to
do
it
manually
by
hand.
mr.
luther
hudson
well,
he
did
it
by
hand
is
distinct
from
some
mechanical
method.
mr.
luther
hudson
yes,
sir.
jury
found
that
he
should
have
had
--
that
he
could
have
had
the
help,
your
honor.
now,
i
don't
know
how
much
time
i've
got
left
so
i
just
very
briefly
hit
this
last
one.
i'm
skipping
over
the
question
of
texas
pleading.
at
texas
--
mr.
luther
hudson
that's
right,
manually.
it
was
negligence
to
do
it
manually.
they
couldn't
find
--
they
couldn't
find
it
was
negligence
consistently.
mr.
luther
hudson
well,
they
didn't,
judge,
i
argued
pretty
loud
and
long
and
i
--
as
i
say,
i
can
get
--
mr.
luther
hudson
yes,
sir.
mr.
luther
hudson
no,
no,
no,
manually.
no,
sir,
and
then
--
in
the
language
it's
there.
i
think
that's
one
of
my
requested
issues.
mr.
luther
hudson
i'd
hadn't
plead
it
that
way,
judge.
i've
said
the
way
and
manner,
and
we
have
to
submit
them
the
way
we
had
it
pleaded.
mr.
luther
hudson
oh,
i
don't
say
you
have
to,
judge,
i
don't
--
mr.
luther
hudson
on
that
--
that's
what
it
--
that's
what
it
meant
to
me
and
that's
what
it
meant
to
the
appellate
court.
now,
don't
ask
me
where
i
could
--
put
a
finger
on
where
they
said
that
but
that's
what
it
meant,
that's
where
we
tried
this
lawsuit
--
where
we
tried
this
lawsuit.
mr.
luther
hudson
no,
sir.
they've
said
way
and
manner
and
the
only
way
and
manner
he
did
it
was
manually.
mr.
luther
hudson
well,
i
don't
think
it
gets
us
--
mr.
luther
hudson
i
--
mr.
justice
black,
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
where
we
are
now.
does
that
mean
my
time
is
up?
mr.
luther
hudson
all
right,
i'll
--
let
me
take
these
last
few
minutes
then
to
hit
this
issue
of
pleading.
we
haven't
--
it's
not
an
unreasonable
rule
to
pleading
these
men
designed
to
--
to
prevent
plaintiffs
from
recovery
and
it
works
on
the
defendant
just
exactly
the
same
way
it
works
on
the
plaintiff.
and
i'll
lose
more
cases
than
most
people
do.
it's
used
on
me
just
as
much
it
did
on
anybody
else.
we
--
what
we
do
instead
of
going
through
this
process
when
i'm
in
a
federal
court,
i
file
interrogatories.
i
take
depositions.
i
get
a
pretrial
by
a
hearing
and
we
thrash
out
what
the
issues
are
in
the
case.
and
it
takes
a
lot
of
time,
waste
the
court's
time,
waste
the
lawyer's
time
in
the
state
court
while
we
get
pleadings.
we
know
what
the
case
is
about
because
the
man
has
got
to
tell
us
from
the
pleadings.
we're
not
going
to
be
surprised.
now,
the
rules
of
amendment
are
very
liberal.
up
to
seven
days
before
trial,
you
can
amend
without
asking
the
court's
permission.
you
got
a
right
to
amend
as
a
matter
of
light.
after
that
you
got
a
right
to
amend
where
the
court's
approval
right
on
down
to
the
time
of
judgment.
so
the
rules
of
practice
on
a
pleading,
these
rules
that
the
court
applied
here
and
that
they
apply
in
other
cases,
the
man
is
bound
by
his
pleadings
when
he
says,
"did
you
fail
to
do
neither
of
two
things?"
all
the
other
man
has
got
to
prove
is
he
did
one
of
them
to
be
home
free.
that's
the
rule
that
applies
to
everybody
and
it
doesn't
deprive
plaintiff
from
any
substantial
right.
it
doesn't
interfere
with
the
mistakes
about
seven
times
out
of
eight.
it
doesn't
have
any
constitute
and
unreasonable
obstacle
in
the
way
of
the
plaintiff's
lawsuit
or
the
defendant's
defense.
it's
just
our
way
of
saving
all
this
stuff
about
a
pretrial
hearing
and
interrogatories
and
request
for
admission.
it
works,
it
works
fine.
now,
the
last
thing
is
about
the
evidence.
actually,
there
isn't
any
evidence
in
this
case
as
to
tools
except
the
testimony
about
a
c-clamp
--
and
a
c-clamp
and
a
vise
clamp
and
an
iron
clamp
as
i
remember.
these
were
all
invented
from
the
witness
stand
by
the
plaintiff
and
--
my
time
is
up.
mr.
luther
hudson
they
are
all
invented
by
the
plaintiff
on
the
witness
stand.
he
testified
they
were
dangerous
and
there
is
no
--
they've
never
been
tried,
nobody
know
where
they'd
worked
or
what
work,
where
they
had
helped
a
man
hurting.
they
hadn't
been
--
the
other
had
been
used,
a
manual
method
had
been
used
and
did
it
work,
it
had
been
safe.
and
i
would
say
there
isn't
any
evidence
if
you
get
down
to
that
point.
