justice
hugo
l.
black
finding
number
15
in
connection
to
this
one.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
said
do
you
find
from
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
the
defendant
railway
company
had
supervised
the
(inaudible)
or
whatever
it
is,
should
have
reasonably
anticipated
that
the
plaintiff
would
perform
the
work
which
caused
his
injuries
in
the
way
and
manner
in
which
he
did
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
says
the
manner
which
he
did
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
did
it
without
any
help
too,
without
the
help
you
say
that
he
suppose
to
have.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
this
--
may
i
ask
you
this,
i
don't
quite
understand
this
number
13.
do
you
find
from
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
the
plaintiff
was
negligent
in
the
manner
and
method
used
in
doing
the
work
from
the
time
he
sustained
the
injuries?
answer
-
yes
or
no.
answer
-
no.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
suppose
the
jury
understood
that
manually?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
ask
for
it?
did
you
ask
for
the
charge
in
that
--
in
those
words?
justice
hugo
l.
black
manually?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
didn't
you
put
manually
in
if
that's
what
you
meant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
you
say
we
have
to
consider,
it
means
manually?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
--
i'm
just
--
i
was
trying
to
get
just
what
it
was.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
jury
didn't
have
the
word
"manually"
though.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
also
did
it
with
one
or
more
persons
helping
him,
whatever
all
the
circumstances
are
out
there,
i
would
have
thought
that
meant
(inaudible)
or
maybe
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
findings.
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
it
has
no
relevance.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
jury
found
that
against
him,
didn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
jury
found
that
in
the
charge
again?
