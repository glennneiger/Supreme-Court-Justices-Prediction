mr.
douglas
m.
orr
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
mr.
mahoney
argued
this
case
in
the
lower
courts
and
was
to
have
argued
it
here,
but
his
health
is
deemed
very
poor.
so,
i
apologize
that
you
must
take
up
for
a
substitute.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
the
petitioner
here
is
goodall-sanford,
inc,
a
maine
corporation
that
did
have
a
very
substantial
textile
business
at
sanford,
maine.
the
respondent
is
afl
local
802
--
1802
now
afl-cio
local
1802
and
united
textile
workers
of
america
cio.
the
parties
entered
into
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
1951,
which
was
renewed
in
1953
and
which
expired
in
july
1955.
that
agreement
provided
among
other
things
that
management
of
the
business
was
to
be
vested
exclusively
in
the
company.
that
an
employee's
service
continued
until
it
was
terminated.
an
employee's
service
could
be
terminated
for
any
of
three
reasons,
a
voluntary
quit,
a
discharge
for
cause,
or
a
layoff
for
a
period
of
18
months.
the
contract
also
provided
for
the
customary
four
steps
of
grievance
procedure
which
were
not
followed
in
this
case,
but
which
were
deemed
to
have
been
waived
by
the
district
court.
following
those
four
steps,
contract
provided
for
arbitration.
it
also
provided
for
the
usual
no-strike
clause
except
on
a
question
of
a
general
increase
in
wages.
now,
the
contract
also
provided
for
certain
benefits
to
the
employee
and
those
benefits
are
what
are
in
issue
here.
one
is
vacation
pay
for
employees
who
are
on
the
payroll
on
june
1st
of
any
year
and
who
had
900
hours
of
service
since
the
previous
june
1.
secondly,
it
provided
for
certain
hospitalization,
blue
cross,
and
life
insurance
benefits.
and
the
application
of
those
benefits
to
employees
on
layoff
was
somewhat
different
from
those
who
were
terminated
in
that
they
could
continue
paying
a
reduced
premium
and
keep
them
alive
during
the
layoff
period.
thirdly,
the
contract
provided
for
pensions
to
employees
who
had
20
years
service
of
$20
a
week
upon
reaching
age
65
and
of
$25
a
week
--
a
month
--
thank
you,
for
those
who
had
25
years
of
service
upon
reaching
age
65.
now,
the
general
background
on
this
case,
goodall-sanford,
inc.had
sales
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
30,
1954
of
approximately
$50
million
and
a
loss
before
taxes
of
about
$4.5
million.
consequently,
sometime
in
the
spring
of
1954,
liquidation
of
a
substantial
part
of
the
operations
was
contemplated
and
plans
were
made
for
it.
incidentally,
during
the
summer
of
1954,
burlington
industries,
inc.made
a
public
tender
for
the
common
stocks
of
goodall-sanford
and
is
now
an
owner
of
substantially
all
of
it.
the
liquidation
of
the
--of
the
company's
plants
at
sanford,
maine
continued.
and
by
the
end
of
may
1955,
it
had
completely
gone
out
of
business
there
and
all
of
its
employees
had
been
terminated.
now,
goodall-sanford,
inc.as
a
corporation
is
still
alive
and
it
still
operates
two
plants,
one
at
hot
springs,
north
carolina
and
another
at
reading,
massachusetts.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
that's
right,
sir.
now,
in
january
of
1955,
some
1100
hired
employees
who
were
then
on
layoff
status,
were
notified
that
they
would
be
terminated
because
the
departments
in
which
they
worked
was
completely
shut
down
and
would
not
reopen
in
any
event.
in
february
1955,
some
255
more
employees
were
also
terminated.
in
march
of
1955,
the
union
asked
the
company
to
arbitrate
the
issues
involved
in
whether
they
had
a
right
to
terminate
these
employees.
and
this
request
was
refused
by
the
company
on
the
ground
that
it
was
a
prerogative
of
management
to
close
the
business
for
economic
reasons.
and
that
it
also
had
the
right
to
terminate
employees
incidental,
thereto,
if
there
was
no
hope
of
ever
re-employing.
so,
i
will
say
that
in
this
case
of
the
three
that
are
here
before
the
court
today,
the
decision
of
the
court
is
of
very
material
importance
aside
from
the
principle
involved.
because
a
fairly
substantial
amount
of
money
is
involved
and
the
question
of
whether
they
are
entitled
to
vacation
pay,
whether
those
who
were
terminated
and
thereafter
would
have
gotten
pensions
would
be
entitled
to
them
and
certain
incidental
insurance
benefits
which
they
might
have
been
deprived
of
prior
to
the
termination
of
the
union
contract,
july
1955.
now,
following
the
--
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
--
the
refusal
but
--
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
yes.
and
it's
important
if
--
if
they
won,
too,
sir.
i
mean
--
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
--
a
material
amount
of
money
involved
if
it
goes
to
arbitration
and
the
arbitrator
decides
it
either
way.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
now,
the
--
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
no
sir.
it
does
not.
following
the
refusal
to
arbitrate
--
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
because
it
was
a
prerogative
of
management
to
close
the
plant
and
if
the
employees
had
no
hope
of
re-employment,
that
they
could
also
terminate
the
employment
of
the
employees.
and
that
therefore,
it
was
not
an
arbitrable
issue
under
the
terms
of
the
contract.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
yes,
sir.
whether
the
business
should
be
continued.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
exactly,
sir.
and
the
complaint
--
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
no,
sir.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
no,
sir.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
now,
the
complaint
filed
by
the
union
upon
the
refusal
of
the
arbitration
asked
for
two
things.
it
asked
for
a
temporary
restraining
order
against
the
termination
of
some
1800
additional
employees
who
were
still
on
the
payroll
and
who
would
not
be
terminated,
at
least,
until
the
end
of
the
contract
period
according
to
the
union,
but
which
the
company
had
already
given
notice
would
be
terminated.
so,
they
asked
through
injunction
against
their
termination
and
also
asked
for
a
--a
specific
decree
ordering
arbitration
of
the
company's
right
to
terminate
anybody.
the
district
court
granted
the
temporary
restraining
order.
and
then
after
a
hearing,
the
temporary
injunction
was
granted
but
then
dissolved.
but
the
district
court
did,
upon
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
ordered
the
matter
to
be
arbitrated.
a
motion
to
dismiss
made
by
the
company
on
the
ground
of
westinghouse
was
denied.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
no,
sir.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
the
--
the
issue
of
arbitrability
was
put
in
by
the
circuit
court.
we
asked
for
certiorari
on
that
question
but
the
--
this
court
denied
a
review
of
that
question.
yes,
sir.
now,
the
district
court
held
that
this
--
that
it
had
jurisdiction
under
section
301
and
it
decreed
specific
performance
of
the
agreement
to
arbitrate.
it
also,
as
i
mentioned
a
while
ago,
held
that
the
issue
was
arbitrable
and
sent
it
to
an
arbitrator
to
determine
two
questions.
did
goodall-sanford
violate
its
agreement
by
terminating
these
employees
on
the
ground
that
business
operations
were
such
that
it
ceased
in,
completely,
in
continuing
operations
and
terminated
the
employees
because
of
it?
and
secondly,
if
the
company
had
violated
the
contract,
what
must
it
do
to
remedy
the
wrong
to
the
employees?
it
also
said
that
the
decision
of
the
arbitrator
was
to
be
final
and
binding
upon
the
parties
and
did
not
specifically
reserve
any
jurisdiction
in
the
court
--
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
--
as
many
as
award.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
he
did
not
go
on
the
law
of
maine
because
it
seems
to
have
been
conceded
even
at
that
time,that
the
law
of
maine
would
not
permit
the
arbitration
of
a
future
dispute.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
his
opinion
was
pretty
general.
i
think
he
went
mainly
on
the
american
trade
case.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
yes.
[laughs]
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
while
federal
law
was
interpreted
by
judge
wyzanski.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
that's
exactly
--
is
the
answer.
now,
in
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals,
judge
magruder,
at
the
same
time
had
reversed
another
district
court
in
the
general
electric
case
applying
the
late
judge
clifford's
decision
in
this
case.
and
he
said
first,
that
the
order
of
the
district
court
was
appealable
since
it
was
a
final
order.
that's
a
question
that's
unique
to
this
case
of
the
three
and
also
a
question,
incidentally,
which
was
not
raised
in
the
district
court.
but
he
held
that
it
was
appealable,
nevertheless.
second,
he
said
that
the
court
had
jurisdiction
under
section
301
but
it
could
not
grant
an
injunction
under
that
section
compelling
arbitration
because
this
--
the
substantive
common
law
of
the
federal
courts
would
not
permit
it.
however,
and
he
said
incidentally
that
the
substantive
federal
common
law
would
have
been
applicable
and
not
the
state
law
because
it
wasn't
a
diversity
case.
thirdly,
he
raised
for
the
first
time,
u.s.arbitration
act
in
this
case
which
wasn't
considered
either
by
the
respondent
or
the
district
court.
and
he
said
under
the
u.s.arbitration
act
that
it
was,
the
court
did
have
jurisdiction
to
compel
arbitration
both
because
this
was
not
in
a
form
of
the
contract
and
it
was
a
transaction
--
a
--
contract
governs
in
a
transaction
in
commerce.
he
also
considered
the
norris-la
guardia
act
and
held
it
inapplicable.
and
finally,
he
decided
that
the
dispute
of
whether
the
company
have
the
right
to
terminate
employees
was
inarbitrable.
he
also
volunteered
the
suggestion
in
the
general
electric
case
that
the
question
of
the
very
arbitrability
of
the
contract
might
be
passed
on
to
the
arbitrator
if
the
parties
have
worded
their
contract
so
that
the
arbitrator
had
that
power.
so,
we
view
the
legislation
that
judge
magruder
enacted
as
almost
a
complete
application
of
the
general
jurisdiction
of
federal
courts
in
this
entire
hearing.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
[laughs]
i
think
that
might
be
a
better
word.
but
he
held
that
they
could
--
the
courts
would
compel
the
submission
to
arbitration.
he
further
held
that
in
this
case
the
very
wide
discretion
given
to
the
arbitrator
to
determine
what
remedies
were
proper
was
correct
and
the
arbitrator's
decision
was
to
be
final
and
binding.
and
finally,
he
even
suggested
that
the
decree
of
the
court
might
not
be
appealable.
now,
this
court
granted
certiorari
because
of
the
conflict
in
the
lincoln
mills
case.
now,
i'm
going
to
touch
on
only
those
points
that
i
think
might
have
some
material
bearing
on
this
dispute.
now,
the
first
one
is
what
federal
question
is
involved?
and
i
think
that
question
has
been
decided
by
the
(inaudible)
case
in
the
fifth
circuit.
in
that
case,
the
complaint
by
the
union
was
that
the
company
had
breached
an
agreement
to
pay
certain
welfare
benefits
through
a
commission.
and
it
asked
for
past
damages
for
its
past
failures
and
an
injunction
against
discontinuing
to
make
those
payments.
and
the
court
noted
that
the
contract
was
made
in
texas,
was
to
be
performed
in
texas,
and
was
breached
in
texas.
and
it
stated
and
has
the
language
that
it
said
--
said
it
here
and
i
think
it's
very
apt.
the
crucial
problem
is
the
degree
to
which
federal
law
affects
the
decision
of
the
controversy.
in
the
instant
case,
federal
law
does
not
affect
it
at
all
on
its
merits.
i
think
the
same
thing
is
true
in
this
case.
i
think
that
if
i
had
read
the
statutes
at
large
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
i
could
not
have
found
the
federal
law.
i
think
that
was
mr.
wernick's
job
and
i
don't
think
he
will
point
one
out
to
you
either.
that
same
decision
was
reached
in
amalgamated
association
versus
southern
bus
lines
in
the
fifth
circuit.
in
that
case,
the
union
brought
suit
on
behalf
of
its
members
against
a
bus
line
to
compel
arbitration
of
changes
in
the
employment
contract.
and
the
plaintiff
apparently
alleged
these
grounds
for
jurisdiction
but
the
suit
was
based
on
facts
arising
out
of
interstate
commerce
on
the
contract
involving
interstate
transportation.
and
therefore,
arises
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
now,
i
assume
that
it
was
so
and
it
was
construed
as
an
argument
an
allegation
that
it
was
a
question
arising
under
the
interstate
commerce
act.
in
any
event,
the
court
said
what
is
here
involved
is
merely
a
controversy
between
the
parties
as
to
the
construction
of
a
contact
which
allegedly
arises
out
of
the
laws
of
the
united
states,
respecting
collective
bargaining
between
employers
and
employees
in
interstate
commerce.
but
the
right
of
action
asserted
does
not
arise
out
of
those
laws,
but
only
arises
from
the
subsequent
contractual
relations
of
the
parties.
the
wrongful
breach
of
such
relations
does
not
confer
federal
jurisdiction
unless
there
is
diverse
citizenship.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr

douglas

amalgamated
association
versus
southern
bus
lines.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
now,
it
may
be
said
that
if
none
of
these
questions
arise
under
a
federal
law,
then
how
could
a
301
case
come
at
--
up
at
all?
and
in
my
opinion,
it
is
quite
remote
and
it's
even
remote
in
the
case
of
a
cause
of
action
simply
for
damages
either
by
a
company
against
a
union
or
by
a
union
against
a
company
because
there
is
no
federal
statute
under
which
it
arises.
now,
there
could
be
cases
and
i
think
the
cases,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
were
mentioned
in
a
note
you
made
to
westinghouse.
for
example,
suppose
a
contract
contained
a
provision
that
the
union
members
would
not
engage
in
partaking
--
in
picketing
the
premises
of
a
customer.
well,
that
might
be
a
secondary
boycott
question
which
is
covered
by
section
303
and
therefore,
you
might
say
that
that
case
arises
under
a
federal
law.
or
you
might
have
a
provision
that
the
company
agrees
that
it
will
not
overtly
or
otherwise,
make
any
payment
to
any
representative
of
the
union
and
there
you
might
have
a
case
that
comes
up
under
section
303
which
forbids
that.
similarly,
you
could
have
provisions
in
a
contract
which
involve
unfair
labor
practices
which
would
thereby
give
the
jurisdiction
--
give
jurisdiction
to
a
federal
court
under
section
301.
it's
our
position
you
should
not
go
further
than
that.
the
second
point
i
wish
to
cover
is
that
assuming
the
court
does
have
jurisdiction,
can
it
compel
arbitration?
now,
our
view
is
that
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
lincoln
mills
case
and
the
steelworkers
case
in
the
seventh
circuit
decided
last
month
are
right
on
that
question.
both
of
them
followed
the
same
reasoning.
the
steelworkers
case,
in
fact,
just
sprung
along
with
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
lincoln
mills
case.
but
they
--
the
--
the
court
in
the
galland-henning
manufacturing
company
case
which
was
the
steelworkers
case
said,
"that
a
reading
of
the
plea
on
an
ambiguous
language,
however,
forces
us
to
review
that
no
substantive
rights
will
create."
the
--
the
lincoln
mills
majority
opinion
said,
"there's
no
federal
substantive
law
out
of
which
to
fashion
such
a
remedy.
and
there's
no
state
law
out
of
which
to
fashion
such
a
remedy.
so,
there
can
be
none
assuming
the
u.s.arbitration
act
is
inapplicable."
now,
if
this
question
turns
on
whether
arbitration
would
substantially
affect
the
outcome
as
has
been
mentioned
in
some
cases,
while
whether
this
is
a
diversity
case
or
not,
we
think
that
it
does
substantially
affect
the
outcome.
incidentally,
i
should
like
to
mention
a
recent
article
in
66
yale
law
journal
at
page
167,
which
points
out
that
the
common
law
rule
against
enforcement
of
future
disputes
for
arbitration
has
been
abrogated
in
only
15
states
out
of
the
48
and
that
of
those
15,
only
seven
specifically
permit
the
application
to
an
agreement
in
a
labor
dispute.
an
example
for
example,
is
massachusetts
which
provided
that
the
parties
to
a
contract
may
submit
future
--
agree
to
submit
future
disputes
to
arbitration,
but
then
it
went
further
and
said
specifically,
that
an
arbitration
agreement
in
a
union
contract
is
valid
and
enforceable.
i
think
that
if
you
--
if
--
if
arbitration
did
not
seriously
affect
the
outcome
of
these
cases,
we
wouldn't
be
here
today.
the
union,
i'm
sure,
has
selected
arbitration
much
if
a
very
drastic
change
from
the
view,
they
took
of
it
many
years
ago
because
they
believe
they
will
come
out
better
by
a
decision
of
an
arbitrator
unfettered
by
the
judicial
protection
that
a
court
puts
around
this
issue.
in
1929,
the
union
took
a
different
position
and
this
is
mentioned
in
the
petitioner's
brief
in
the
general
electric
case,
where
in
their
bulletin
they
said
that
arbitrators
won
but
sometimes
for
appeal
and
they
would
do
so
even
more
if
they
knew
that
courts
where
going
to
judicially
enforce
these
agreements.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
i
--
i'm
forced
to
take
the
word
of
the
author
of
the
yale
law
journal
article
on
that.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
well,
i
think
there
might
be
very
good
grounds
for
it,
your
honor.
[laughs]
but
i
--
i
say
this
and
incidentally,
there's
a
recent
case
in
mississippi
which
is
to
the
contrary
where
there
was
no
statute
at
all
but
which
nevertheless,
i
must
call
this
attention
to
mind.
they
haven't
seen
it
but
they
said
it's
a
public
policy
of
the
state
is
such
that
they
would
enforce
these
specific
agreements
without
the
statute.
but,
again,
turning
to
the
question
of
whether
the
submission
to
arbitration
will
seriously
affect
the
outcome
of
this
case.
i
would
like
to
point
out
a
comment
that
was
made
in
petitioner's
brief
in
the
lincoln
mills
case
in
which
he
said
there
are
two
theories
of
the
function
of
an
arbitrator.
one,
he
interprets
the
language
of
the
contract,
and
the
second
is
that
he
tries
to
reach
some
mutually
acceptable
decision.
now,
here
there's
no
continuing
relationship
between
the
parties.
so,
there's
no
motive
to
reach
a
mutually
acceptable
decision.
but
i
submit
to
you
that
this
arbitrator
may
be
one
of
those
who
believe
that
he
doesn't
have
to
interpret
the
contract
even
if
there's
a
provision
in
there
that
says
he
may
not
modify
or
vary
and
we
would
therefore,
come
out
pretty
bad.
as
matter
of
fact,
i
would
--
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
well,
there
has
been
some
comment,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
if
it
is
a
substantive
question
should
--
which
should
turn
on
the
law
of
the
state
if
it
substantially
affects
the
outcome.
now,
the
law
of
the
state
of
maine
has
been
conceded
to
forbid
the
issuance
of
a
decree
in
such
a
case.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
yes,
sir.
but
i
submit
that
that
contract
was
entered
into
under
the
laws
of
maine
which
would
not
require
it
unless
the
partners
wouldn't
do
it.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
well,
i
--
i'm
just
making
the
point
--
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
well,
now
that
is
a
point,
mr.
justice
harlan.
if
you
say
that
a
law
of
united
states
is
concerned
and
involved,
it
may
well
be
that
you
couldn't
look
to
--
to
state
law
at
all.
but
some
of
the
circuit
courts
have
--
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
--
commented
in
--
along
that
line.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
yes,
sir.
that's
the
point
i'm
making.
and
the
--
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
turning
back
to
your
--
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
--
your
question.
some
courts
have
said
that
if
the
question
involved
seriously
can
affect
the
outcome
of
the
case,
then
it
is
a
substantive
question
which
must
be
decided
under
state
law
and
not
a
procedural
questions
which
would
be
decided
on
federal
law.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
have
i
answered
your
question?
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
well,
as
the
law
of
maine
is
quite
clear
that
a
--
an
agreement
to
arbitrate
a
future
dispute
cannot
be
enforced
in
the
courts.
and
i
say
that
if
you
have
time
to
start
with
maine
law
because
this
is
--
this
is
a
substantive
question,
then
the
answer
is
clear.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
yes,
sir.
we
did.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
if
the
law,
the
maine
law,
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
it's
a
logical
assumption
that
it
was
to
be
made
if
the
parties
wanted
to
agree
to
it
and
if
they
didn't,
they
didn't
have
to.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
yes,
sir.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
but
if
we
required
--
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
--
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
at
all,
but
if
it's
a
--
such
a
substantive
question
as
distinguished
from
procedural
that
you've
got
to
apply
state
law.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
that's
exactly
our
--
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
because
if
it
--
it
makes
a
lot
of
difference
how
we
come
out,
then
it
makes
a
lot
of
difference
where
the
state
law
ought
to
be
applied
according
to
the
comments
in
some
of
the
circuit
law.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
[laughs]
well,
that
that
very
language
was
used
in
the
--
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
yes,
sir.
it
--
it
has
been
now.
now,
the
petitioner
in
the
lincoln
mills
case
has
gone
to
great
pains
to
say
that
the
arbitration
provision
is
a
consideration
for
the
no-strike
provision
and
if
the
company
can
sue
for
damages
because
of
violation
of
the
no-strike
agreement,
then
you've
got
to
let
the
union
sue
to
compel
specific
performance.
i
don't
think
that's
true
if
it
were
every
agreement
could
have
a
no-strike
clause
would
also
have
to
have
an
arbitration
clause.
and
furthermore,
as
pointed
out
by
the
general
electric
company,
the
no-strike
clause
is
actually
the
inducement
to
the
entire
contract
on
the
part
of
most
companies
because
without
it,
there
would
be
very
little
advantage
to
them
in
entering
into
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
at
all.
i
say
the
no-strike
clause
is
consideration
for
the
wages,
workloads,
seniority
provisions
and
everything
else.
and
you
can't
segregate
it
that
way.
and
incidentally,
if
you
follow
that
argument
to
its
conclusion
it
said
in
--
in
the
present
situation
that
our
agreement
to
arbitrate
is
consideration
for
the
union's
agreement
not
to
strike,
you
end
up
very
foolishly
because
all
the
work
is
gone.
i
would
like
to
remind,
mr.
justice
clark,
of
his
comment
in
the
cutter
laboratories
case.
black
versus
cutter
laboratories
was
decided
last
summer
which
involved
the
question
of
whether
a
woman
who
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party
was
discharged
for
cause.
and
the
supreme
court
of
california
said
that
she
was
and
this
court
said
in
confronting
the
california
supreme
court,
the
decision
involves
--
and
this
was
a
--
a
union
contract
case.
the
decision
involves
only
california
construction
of
a
local
contract
under
a
local
law
and
therefore,
no
substantial
federal
question
is
presented.
now,
i
believe
if
it
is
local
for
the
california
supreme
court,
it
is
local
also
of
the
united
states
supreme
court
and
the
federal
courts.
turning
just
a
minute
to
the
norris-laguardia
act
and
i'm
not
going
to
spend
any
time
on
it
because
this
particular
statute
is
the
most
frustrating
to
argue
about.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
in
my
opinion
there
is.
if
a
statute
says
you
can't
issue
an
injunction
any
place,
anywhere
unless
you
conform
strictly
to
the
following
rules.
to
argue
that
nevertheless,
where
you
got
an
arbitration
case
you
don't
have
to
conform
to
those
rules.
you
can
issue
it
anyways.
where
the
plain
--
where
the
language
is
so
plain
that
you
don't
have
to
turn
any
place
else
to
see
what
it
means,
it's
our
view
that
you've
got
to
follow
the
language.
you
shouldn't
have
to
go
back
into
what
the
legislature
said
or
anything
else.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
section
1
of
that
act
provides,
"that
no
court
of
the
united
states
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
issue
any
injunction
in
a
labor
dispute
except
in
strict
compliance
with
the
provisions
of
the
act."
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
i
submit
it
most
certainly
is
whether
it's
a
mandatory
injunction,
whether
you're
saying
in
effect
that
we
will
enjoin
you
from
continuing
not
to
arbitrate
--
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
--
or
whether
we
will
issue
an
injunction
compelling
you
to
arbitrate
are
one
and
the
same
thing.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
well
now,
if
your
honor,
please.
on
that
reasoning
you
could
enjoin
the
union's
covenant
not
to
strike
because
they
have
agreed
in
this
contract
that
they
would
not
strike.
and
you
could
say,
“well,
i'm
not
enjoined
the
--
enjoining
the
employees
from
striking.
what
i'm
doing
is
enjoining
the
union
from
permitting
to
strike.”
well,
i
think
the
union
would
have
to
take
a
long
time
to
go
along
with
that.
they
--
they
wouldn't
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
--
in
--
with
the
police.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
well,
may
i
ask
you,
your
honor.
would
you
consider
a
--
a
decree
enjoining
the
union
from
failing
to
perform
its
agreement
not
to
strike,
which
is
a
simple
covenant
not
to
strike.
would
that
be
prohibited
by
the
norris-laguardia
act?
i
believe
the
mead
case
has
held
it
is
forbidden
because
it
involves
possible
--
it's
within
--
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
--
the
specific
provision
of
section
4.
anyway,
if
i
may
just
repeat
the
one
point
i
wish
to
make
that
section
1
provides,
"that
no
court
shall
issue
any
injunction
in
a
labor
dispute
except
in
strict
compliance
with
the
provisions
of
the
act."
and
section
7,
similarly
says,
"that
no
court
of
the
united
states
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
issue
an
injunction
and
a
labor
dispute
except
after
hearing
and
findings
of
fact
that
unlawful
acts
are
threatened
and
the
public
officers
won't
furnish
the
needed
protection."
now,
just
because
they
can't
bring
themselves
within
that
exception,
the
respondents
are
forced
to
say
that
the
act
is
not
applicable
at
all.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
yes,
i'm
sure
you
could.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
yes,
yes.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
yes,
sir.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
turning
now
for
a
moment
to
the
united
states
arbitration
act.
i
would
like
to
borrow
what
i
consider
a
right,
apt
phrase
used
by
judge
wyzanski
in
the
boston
printing
pressmen's
union
case.
would
congress
ever
have
dreamed
that
section
301
driven
in
tandem
with
the
united
states
arbitration
act
would
be
used
to
specifically
enforce
an
injunction
--
to
specifically
enforce
an
agreement
to
arbitrate?
the
dilemma
that
this
has
thrown
some
of
the
court's
standards
indicated,
i
think,
even
by
judge
magruder's
language
in
the
general
electric
case
below
because
he
has
to
argue
inconsistently
with
himself.
and
this
has
been
pointed
out
in
the
steelworker's
case
which
is
to
be
here
also
on
grant
of
certiorari.
in
other
words,
he
says,
in
saying
that
this
is
not
a
contract,
evidencing
a
--
this
is
a
contract
evidencing
a
transaction
in
commerce,
he
has
to
say
this,
“the
collective
agreement
sets
the
terms
and
conditions
under
what,
which
not
one,
but
hundreds
or
thousands
of
workers
are
employed."
that's
when
he's
arguing
that
it's
a
contract
evidencing
a
transaction
in
commerce,
but
then
he
at
the
same
time
concludes
that
it's
not
an
employment
contract
under
section
1.
now,
as
all
of
you
(inaudible)
the
average
textile
mill
worker
at
least
has
nothing
to
evidence
his
contract
of
employment
except
he's
put
on
the
payroll
and
where
there
is
a
union
contract,
it
covers
practically
all
of
the
rest
with
the
terms
and
conditions
if
it's
as
broad
in
scope
as
the
contract
which
we
have
under
consideration
here.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
the
--
the
legislative
history
of
the
u.s.arbitration
act?
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
of
301?
i
don't
think
they
considered
it
at
all
except
when,
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
pointed
out,
they
had
up
before
them
the
question
of
whether
a
breach
of
contract
should
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
and
they
--
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
--
decided
not
to
include
that.
they
--
and
they
--
there
was
specific
comment,
i
believe,
in
that
discussion
as
to
whether
a
failure
to
abide
by
covenant
to
arbitrate
should
be
considered
an
unfair
labor
practice.
and
they
didn't
include
that
either.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
yes.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
exactly.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
but
i
--
i
still
agree
that,
that
would
have
been
so,
had
they
done
it,
which
they
didn't.i
think
that
the
petitioner
in
the
lincoln
mills
case
is
so
--
hung
himself
in
persisting
so
earnestly
in
his
argument
that
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
something
vastly
and
entirely
different
from
a
commercial
contract.
and
therefore,
the
fact
that
there's
no
substantive
law
allowing
this
specific
enforcement
of
a
contact
to
arbitrate
in
a
commercial
dispute,
has
no
application
whatsoever
to
a
labor
dispute.
you've
got
to
consider
that
something
entirely
different.
now,
if
that
is
so,
i
think
he's
hung
on
the
u.s.arbitration
act
because
everyone
conceives
that
at
least
primarily
it
had
as
its
purpose
nothing
more
than
commercial
contracts,
agreements
to
arbitrate
in
commercial
contracts.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
that's
right.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
yes.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
yes.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
now,
section
4
of
the
arbitration
act
provides
that
a
litigant
can
come
in
and
enforce
arbitration
under
section
4
if
the
united
states
courts
had
jurisdiction
except
for
the
agreement
to
arbitrate.
well,
i
think
that
--
and
i'm
coming
to
this
in
just
a
moment,
except
for
the
agreement
to
arbitrate,
you
don't
have
anything
here
but
a
westinghouse
case.
but
he
gets
around
that
by
saying,
“well,
we
will
use
sections
1
and
2
of
the
arbitration
act
to
say
that
this
is
a
valid
and
enforceable
contract.
but
we
elect
not
to
use
section
4
because
we
can't
use
it."
now,
as
this
court
knows
there's
been
several
interpretations
of
section
1.
that
the
definitions
in
section
1
of
u.s.arbitration
act
are
applicable
to
the
entire
act.
it's
an
integral
statute
and
i
submit
very
earnestly
that
you
cannot
use
sections
1
and
2
and
then
because
you
can't
comply
with
section
4
that
we
will
rely
on
general
equitable
jurisdiction
to
let
us
enforce
it
even
though
we
can't
comply
with
it.
and
i
want
to
specifically
mention
two
things
in
section
4
that
are
very
material
on
that
point.
one
is
that
a
party
may
ask
for
a
jury
trial
if
either
there
is
an
issue
on
whether
the
agreement
to
arbitrate
was
made
or
whether
the
agreement
to
arbitrate
was
breached.
and
i
might
mention
that
the
petitioner
here
did
not
have
that
election
because
the
u.s.arbitration
act
was
never
mentioned
at
all.
we
didn't
have
the
choice
of
a
jury
trial.
and
although
it
wasn't
a
substantial
issue
in
the
court
below,
it
might
have
been
if
we
felt
we
could
have
got
a
jury
rather
than
the
judge.
now,
coming
to
the
underlying
merits
of
the
case
aside
from
the
agreement
to
arbitrate,
you
have
nothing
in
the
world
here
but
the
westinghouse
case.
in
westinghouse,
the
union
asked
for
a
declaratory
judgment
that
4000
employees
were
entitled
to
one
day's
pay
in
april.
here,
you
have
a
request
for
arbitration
that
some
1400
employees
should
be
entitled
to
vacation
pay,
should
be
entitled
to
pensions
where
they
have
length
of
service
sufficient
to
warrant
them,
and
that
they
should
have
certain
money
payments
under
the
group
insurance
provisions
of
the
group
insurance
contract.
so,
absent,
the
agreement
to
arbitrate,
you
don't
have
anything
in
the
world
here
but
a
westinghouse
case
and
i
submit
that
an
agreement
to
arbitrate
and
specific
enforcement
of
that
agreement
is
practically
the
same
as
a
declaratory
judgment
on
the
part
of
the
union
asking
for
the
same
thing.
now,
if
in
--
a
declaratory
judgment
is
granted
under
section
2202
or
maybe
--
2202.
the
federal
court
may
go
further
and
grant
whatever
relief
it
--
it
feels
may
be
warranted
on
the
basis
of
the
declaratory
judgment.
here,
if
this
court
enforces
specific
arbitration,
the
arbitrator
is
at
liberty
to
grant
whatever
relief
might
be
warranted.
but
i
might
point
out
that
if
the
arbitrator
says
that
the
union
is
entitled
to
no
relief,
i
believe
that
1400
employees
are
not
barred
at
all
in
any
way
from
going
into
a
state
court
and
suing
on
their
particular
contract
of
hiring,
the
company
has
got
to
start
all
over
again.
coming
finally
to
the
appealability
of
this
case
--
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
well
--
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
--
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
--
this
is
submitted
to
arbitration
at
the
request
of
the
union.
and
the
arbitrator
says,
“we
don't
--
i
don't
think
you're
entitled
to
anything.”
i
don't
think
that's
res
judicata
for
the
individual
employees.
i
think
they
may
later
go
into
a
state
court
and
say,
“well,
i
--
i'm
entitled
to
this
vacation
pay
and
i
want
damages
because
of
it
and
i
don't
believe
that
the
arbitrator's
award
would
follow
that.”
the
individual
employee
is
not
--
having
been
appointed
to
it
all.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
well,
if
they
win,
i
assume
that
we're
stuck
but
if
they
lose,
then
they're
not.
[laughs]
that
--
one-sided
situation,
i'm
afraid
you
--
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
yes,
sir.
that's
so.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
i'm
thinking
of
the
reversed
decision.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
i'm
--
i'm
thinking
of
the
revised
situations.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
yes.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
then
they
not
barred.
i
don't
see
anywhere
you
could
bar
them
at
all.
in
coming
to
the
last
question,
the
--
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
--
the
appealability
which
as
i
mentioned
before
was
raised
in
the
first
instance
by
judge
magruder
and
he
raised
it
and
then
knocked
it
down
as
being
a
strong
man.
he
said
that
he
believed
that
if
--
if
the
petitioner
who
had
requested
arbitration
was
refused
arbitration,
there
wouldn't
be
any
question
of
what
--
what
he
should
have
the
right
to
appeal.
therefore,
he
granted
it.
the
losing
party
should
similarly
have
a
right
to
appeal.
but
i
--
i
would
like
to
point
out,
and
i
--
i
don't
think
this
is
a
very
serious
issue
even
on
the
part
of
the
respondent
in
this
case.
that
there's
no
question
whatsoever
that
this
proceeding
is
not
ancillary
to
either
an
action
at
law
or
an
action
at
inequity.
it's
a
completely
independent
proceeding.
and
the
award
that's
made
is
final
in
every
sense
of
the
word
within
the
meaning
of
title
28
of
the
code.
it's
also
an
injunction
within
the
meaning
of
the
title
28
of
the
code.
and
i'm
happy
to
announce
that
the
second
circuit
has
finally
straightened
itself
out
on
this
question
which
it
seemed
to
be
having
quite
a
good
deal
of
difficulty
in
--
in
the
recent
case
of
farr
&
co.versus
intercontinental
de
navegacion
de
cuba,
decided
february
4,
1957.
they
went
back
and
said
that
within
this
bernstein
case,
that
should
be
distinguished
because
it
was
a
continuous
proceeding
in
which
an
award
have
been
made
and
which
a
request
have
been
made
to
vacate
the
award
and
to
resubmit
it
to
arbitration.
so,
they
said
it
was
interlocutory
in
character.
but
when
they
had
the
actual
case
of
an
independent
proceeding
on
all
fours
of
this
one,
although
that
was
a
maritime
case
in
which
damages
were
asked
for
--
damages
to
sugar
on
a
vessel.
it
distinguished
the
previous
case
and
said,
where
you
have
an
independent
proceeding,
where
the
only
relief
asked
has
been
granted
or
denied,
it
is
appealable.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
yes,
sir.
that's
farr,
f-a-r-r,
and
co.versus
intercontinental
and
so
forth,
second
circuit,
february
4
of
this
year.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
yes.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
this
case
--
no,
sir.
i
believe
we
had
to
look
for
it
upstairs
in
our
--
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
one
brief.
mr.
douglas
m.
orr
as
mr.
feller
says,
he
conceded
that
the
main
law
would
not
be
applicable
to
enforce
arbitration
on
that
but
we
get
to
call
his
attention
to
the
lewiston
case,
but
there's
another
distinction
in
the
lewiston
case
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out.
that
was
the
case
where
the
hearing
had
been
had
and
the
arbitrators
had
indicated
what
the
award
would
be.but
in
addition
to
that,
it
was
an
agreement
to
submit
an
existing
dispute
to
arbitration
and
that
distinction
is
throughout
the
common
law
of
all
the
states.
the
policy
is
against
enforcing
arbitration
on
agreement
to
arbitrated
future
dispute
that
you
don't
know
what's
--
what'll
be
all
about
in
ousting
the
courts
of
jurisdiction
in
those
cases.
now,
on
the
question
of
constitutionality,
we
have
not
argued
that
section
301
is
unconstitutional.
we
say,
if
the
case
comes
up
under
section
301
which
involved
another
federal
law,
it
can
be
constitutionally
applied,
but
301
is
not
itself
such
a
law.
and
mr.
justice
whittaker,
we
do
not
think
that
301
have
the
dual
purpose
of
both
opening
the
door
and
giving
a
remedy.
judge
brown,
in
the
lincoln
case
below
said,
“if
you
did
not
give
it
such
a
dual
purpose,
you
would
open
the
door
but
the
hall
would
be
empty.”
now,
we
would
reverse
that
and
say
that
because
you
have
opened
the
door,
there's
no
assurance
that
the
hall
will
be
full.
