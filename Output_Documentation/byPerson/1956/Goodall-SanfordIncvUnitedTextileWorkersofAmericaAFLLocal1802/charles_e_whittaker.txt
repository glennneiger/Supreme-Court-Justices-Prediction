justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
other
words,
whether
they
should
go
on
or
quit
was
wholly
a
management
problem.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
not
an
arbitrable
one,
that's
your
position?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
i
don't
understand
your
answer
to
justice
frankfurter's
question
that
the
issue
of
arbitrability
of
this
thing
is
not
now
an
issue
here.
and
you
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
it
not
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
orr,
i'm
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
a
decree
to
enforce
a
common
garden
variety
of
covenant
an
injunction?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
can
see
if
it
arose
in
anyway
under
an
equitable
right
as
distinguished
by
the
enforcement
specifically
of
a
covenant
that
you
would
be
right.
but
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
why
we
should
in
truth
call
a
simple
specific
performance
of
a
covenant
an
injunction,
a
mandatory
injunction.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
i
would
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
--
i
will
agree,
there
are
--
there's
no
virtue
in
labels.
but
if
something
just
rebels
in
me
to
consider
a
contract
to
--
a
--
a
suit
to
specifically
(inaudible)
a
simple
covenant
as
an
injunction?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
that
must
be
the
result
to
the
end
of
the
contract
term?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
feller,
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
observation
gets
pointedly
to
what
i
tried
to
get
clear
in
my
mind
yesterday.
i
understand
that
jurisdiction,
in
the
sense
we
are
using
it
here
is
the
power
to
decide.
now,
if
section
301
opened
a
forum
in
respect
of
contracts
between
an
incorporated
labor
organizations
and
employer.
thus,
we
have
a
place
to
go
with
such
a
suit
but
does
not
reclaim
presented
in
that
forum,
thus
opened,
have
to
state
a
claim
upon
which
relief
can
be
granted?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
then,
if
it
does,
you
have
to
go
either
to
the
law
of
the
state
or
to
some
federal
statute,
do
you
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
your
claim
of
federal
statute
is
that
301
is
too
bold
as
i
understand,
that
30
in
and
of
itself
contemplates,
relief
in
this
very
type
of
situation.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
if
that
isn't
correct
in
this
case,
then
do
you
concede
you
must
find
the
basis
of
relief
either
under
the
arbitration
statute,
the
federal
statute
or
period,
isn't
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
it
isn't
correct
that
301
does
it
sought
a
court,
not
only
in
an
open
venue
or
forum
for
the
readdress
of
the
equitable
relief
sought
here.
if
it
does
not,
then
you
must
go
--
the
only
other
source
of
substantive
law
is
the
federal
arbitration
statute.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
before
you
concede,
it
is
on
the
law
of
the
state
it
wouldn't
be
enforceable?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
under
the
law
of
a
state
concerned
here,
whether
it
be
labeled
procedural
or
substantive,
there
is
no
relief.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
right
then.
