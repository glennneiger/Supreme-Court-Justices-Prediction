mr.
david
e.
feller
it's
not
in
the
federal
side
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
in
labor
--
labor
employee
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
--
i
might
add,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
petition
for
certiorari
will
be
filed
any
day
now.
so,
that
we'll
have
printed
copies
of
the
opinion
in
that
case.
i
think
in
the
eight
minutes
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
hope
that
it
will
simply
be
held
and
disposed
of
as
these
cases
are.
we
--
we
don't
want
to
litigate
another
case
but
we
are
faced
with
the
final
order
in
the
seventh
circuit
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
involving
the
same
question.
i
think
in
the
eight
minutes
or
so
that
i
have,
your
honors,
i
can
best
occupy
myself
by
instead
of
engaging
in
a
formal
--
beginning
of
a
formal
presentation,
attempt
to
answer
a
few
of
the
questions
which
have
been
raised
in
the
prior
arguments
on
this
case.
and
so
doing,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
first
to
mr.
justice
whittaker's
question
as
to
the
nature
of
the
grievance
here.
i
gather
that
he's
a
little
concerned
that
the
union
was
trying
to
keep
this
employer
in
business.
i
want
to
make
it
clear,
that
when
we
filed
a
grievance
against
the
termination
of
these
employees,
we
were
not
contending
for
a
minute
that
the
employer
had
to
keep
them
on
the
payroll
in
the
sense
of
paying
them
and
giving
them
work.
in
labor
contracts,
there
is
a
difference
between
laying
a
man
off
and
terminating.
you
terminate
him
when
you
fire.
then
you
discharge
him.
on
the
other
hand,
when
you
don't
have
any
work
for
him,
you
lay
him
off.
and
this
distinction
is
carried
out
in
this
contract,
laid-off
the
employee.
that
is
employees
who
are
on
a
layoff
status
are
entitled
to
vacation
pay
if
they
have
worked
enough
in
the
prior
year.
they've
accrued
of
the
employment.
the
same
light
goes
to
their
certain
pension
rights
and
certain
insurance
rights
to
employees
who
are
laid
off.
the
question
in
this
case
was
whether
in
a
contract
which
provided
that
employees
could
be
terminated
after
they've
been
laid
off
for
18
months
or
they
would
be
terminated
if
they
quit
or
they
were
discharged.
the
employer,
when
he
decided
that
there
wasn't
any
work
for
them
and
that
there
wouldn't
be
any
work
for
them
had
the
right
to
terminate
them,
cutting
off
their
rights
or
that
they
stayed
on
the
layoff
status
and
accrued
whatever
rights
the
parties
agreed
in
their
contract,
laid-off
employees
should
have.
and
that's
the
--
that
was
the
only
question
which
the
union
sought
to
arbitrate.
we
didn't
want
to
keep
this
fellow
in
business.
we
recognize
that
these
are
perfectly
right
on
the
management
clause
to
shut
up
anytime
he
wants.
all
we
want
to
do
is
have
our
employees
continue
to
have
the
rights
they
would
have
had
if
he
laid
them
all
off
and
said,
"i
have
no
work
for
you
for
18
months."
mr.
david
e.
feller
that
is
correct.
these
are
accrued
rights
which
laid-off
employees
have
and
which
we
think
these
employees
were
entitled
to.
now,
the
next
question
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
is
the
question
which
arose
in
many
of
the
prior
arguments
as
to
the
--
of
relationship
between
--
we'll
put
it
this
way,
perhaps.
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
in
section
301
as
far
as
we
can
determine
it
from
the
authoritative
legislative
materials.
and
the
relationship
between
the
agreement
to
arbitrate
and
the
agreement
not
to
strike.
preliminary
to
that
comment,
i
think,
it's
perfectly
plain
that
not
only
are
there
only
15
states
as
far
as
we
know
which
enforce
executory
agreements
to
arbitrate.
but
i
don't
think
only
seven
of
them
applied
that
to
--
to
labor
contracts.
so
that
in
the
great
majority
of
states,
it's
a
matter
of
state
law,
and
i
can't
say
that
i
read
the
cases
in
all
these
states.
i'm
just
citing
a
secondary
authority
but
in
most
of
these
states.
with
the
exception
of
seven,
agreements
to
arbitrate
future
disputes
are
not
enforceable.
what
this
means
is,
that
a
union
which
agrees
not
to
strike,
and
typical
language
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
now
there
--
there
are
simply
hundreds
in
which
this
--
this
occurs.
the
union
agrees
that
the
employer
has
the
right
to
manage
the
business.
he
takes
the
actions.
he
pays
the
wages.
he
schedules
the
work.
he
tells
the
people
what
they
have
to
do
and
you
have
to
do
it
if
you
work
in
the
plant.
you
can't
say
this
is
contrary
to
the
agreement.
you
have
to
do
it.
and
the
only
protection
which
the
union
has
in
these
cases
is
to
either
you
can
shut
it
down.
you
have
a
strike
on
the
issue.
that's
the
old
fashioned
way.
that's
the
way
it
used
to
be
done.
that
was
the
kind
of
case
you
had
in
westinghouse.
that
was
the
kind
of
contract
you
had.
you
could
strike
on
a
question
of
interpretation
and
application
of
the
agreement.
the
employer
didn't
pay
as
he
was
supposed
to
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
if
he
didn't
schedule
the
people,
if
he
didn't
provide
safe
conditions,
if
he
didn't
do
any
of
the
things
which
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
required
him
to
do,
the
union
could
call
a
strike.
today,
in
better
than
90%
of
collecting
bargaining
agreements
have
their
differences.
they
have
a
contract
which
says
there
shall
be
no
strikes
during
the
term
of
this
agreement.
but
all
questions
of
interpretation
and
application
of
the
agreement
shall
be
settled
in
accordance
with
the
grievance
procedure.
the
lincoln
mills
case,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
put
a
right
on
the
same
clause.
it
says
no-strikes
arbitration.
that
was
the
clause.
no-strike
arbitration.
now,
we
come
to
301.
irrespective
of
what
the
congress
intended,
the
federal
courts
to
device
seniority
law
or
overtime
law,
and
i
don't
think
they
did.
there
is
one
thing
that
i
think
they
clearly,
and
that
is
that
if
you
have
one
of
these
clauses
in
a
contract
and
there
was
a
strike,
the
union
ought
to
be
sued
for
damages
and
ought
to
collect
in
the
federal
court,
irrespective
of
state
law.
i
could
wish
it
were
otherwise.
i'm
sure
all
unions
would
prefer
it
otherwise.
but
the
senate
committee
was
particularly
explicit
on
that.
it
said
the
whole
purpose
of
a
collective
bargaining
arrangement
is
to
ensure
industrial
peace
for
the
life
of
the
agreement.
and
they
repeated
that
again
and
again.
and
then
they
said,
now,
one
of
the
problems
here
is
suing
unions.
that's
what
they
were
faced
with.
but
this
problem
was
a
procedural
problem
basically.
though
i
will
say
it's
not
only
a
procedural
problem,
it's
a
substantive
problem
in
some
states.
therefore,
we
said
we'll
not
be
able
to
allow
you
to
sue
these
unions
as
entities.
and
this
was
provided
in
301
(b).
that
when
you
get
a
union
in
court,
you'll
treat
it
as
an
entity.
you
can
--
you
have
jurisdiction
over
it
where
its
offices
are.
they
provided
how
they
should
be
served
what
i
--
but
then
they
said,
“how
you're
going
to
get
them
in
court?
you've
got
to
have
a
federal
cause
of
action.”
and
they
pointed
out
in
the
senate
committee
and
i'm
paraphrasing
the
senate
committee
report,
i
think,
that
it
would
--
extreme
faithfulness
as
far
as
i
can.
they
said
there
are
no
federal
laws
giving
either
an
employer
or
even
the
government
any
right
of
action
against
the
union
for
a
breach
of
contract.
thus,
there
is
no,
their
own
quote,
"substantive
right"
to
enforce
in
order
to
make
the
union
sueable
as
such
in
the
federal
courts.
then
they
proceeded
to
the
proposition
that
if
to
get
them
into
the
federal
courts,
they
would
have
to
make
this
a
federal
statutory
cause
of
action
and
they
said
that's
a
fine
thing,
anyhow.
they
said
statute
--
and
this
is
again
a
quote
from
the
senate
committee
report,
“statutory
recognition
of
the
collective
agreement
as
a
valid,
binding,
and
enforceable
contract
is
a
logical
and
necessary
step.
it
will
promote
a
higher
degree
of
responsibility
upon
the
parties
to
such
agreements
and
will
thereby
promote
industrial
peace.”
well,
this
is
from
the
senate
committee
report
on
section
301,
which
is
virtually
the
statute
which
the
senate
version
was
adapted
by
the
house
and
which
was
virtually
what
statute
we
have.
now,
concededly,
they
focused
entirely
on
the
cases
where
unions
broke
these
promises.
that
the
method
of
policing
the
contract
would
be
through
the
grievance
machinery
and
not
by
a
strike.
obviously,
if
the
strike
says,
you
can
strike,
you
can
strike,
if
the
contract
said
so.
mr.
david
e.
feller
thank
you,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court.
when
we
--
your
honors
will
recall
that
this
is
the
second
of
three
cases
involving
the
question
of
whether
under
section
301,
a
union
may
bring
suit
to
enforce
the
agreement
of
the
employer
to
arbitrate
grievances
arising
during
the
term
of
that
agreement
concerning
the
interpretation
and
application
of
that
agreement.
when
i
finished
yesterday,
i
think
i
was
going
over
the
senate
committee
report
to
what
have
--
the
senate
said
as
to
the
meaning
of
section
301.
i
was
unfortunately
didn't
have
it
with
me
at
the
moment,
but
today
i
do.
and
i
would
like
to
continue
to
illustrate
what
i
think
is
the
critical
question
here
and
that
is
this,
that
although
the
legislative
history
of
301
is
very
unclear
in
many
aspects,
precisely,
the
state
of
the
law
that
congress
meant
to
create
is
very
uncertain.
there
is
one
thing
that
is
clear
and
that
is
that
the
objective
of
section
301
was
to
ensure
that
where
you
had
contracts
which
had
the
kind
of
promise,
which
is
involved
in
these
cases,
that
is
the
grievances
will
be
arbitrated,
will
be
handled
through
the
grievance
procedure
and
that
there
will
not
be
strikes
as
a
method
of
policing
the
enforcement
of
the
contract
that
where
you
had
that
kind
of
a
cause,
there
should
not
be
strikes
and
legal
remedy
should
be
provided
to
ensure
that
there
would
be
labor
peace
during
the
term
of
the
agreement.
now,
how
you
get
to
the
result
is
another
question
which
i
will
come
to,
but
i
want
to
reiterate
again
and
quote
from
the
senate
committee
report
that
see
they
drive
of
what
they
were
trying
to
accomplish
in
this
area.
and
i'm
quoting
from
senate
report
number
105
which
is
the
report
on
the
statute
which
eventually
got
enacted
because
the
senate
version
rather
than
the
house
version
is
different
only
in
language
and
in
one
other
respect
which
i'll
come
to
later.
the
senate
committee
report,
the
first
sentence,
in
dealing
with
these
whole
things
says,
“the
committee
bill
makes
collective
bargaining
contracts
equally
binding
and
enforceable
on
both
parties."
this
is
their
topical
sentence
in
which
they're
telling
you
what
they're
doing.
they
are
making
these
contracts,
binding
and
enforceable
on
both
parties.
and
they
go
on
to
say,
that
this
is
in
according
with
the
purpose
of
the
wagner
act
which
required
the
parties
to
bargaining
with
each
other,
quoting
from
this
court,
describing
the
wagner
act,
“to
the
end
that
an
employment
contract
binding
on
both
party
should
be
made.”
then
they
go
on
to
discuss
the
difficulties
that
have
been
involved
in
suing
unions
and
i
will
--
there's
no
question
that
one
of
the
problems
they
had
was
the
difficulty
in
suing
unions.
but
the
reason
they
were
concerned
with
the
difficulty
in
suing
unions
again
was
taken.
it
says
that
--
that
“if
these
contracts
are
not
enforceable,
you
will
not
"promote
industrial
peace."
the
chief
advantage
and
the
purpose
of
having
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
to
ensure
that
you
will
have
peace
during
the
term
of
that
agreement.
after
discussing
the
procedural
difficulties
and
other
difficulties,
i
will
say
that
there's
a
misconception
that
the
difficulty
was
only
procedural.
really,
the
--
the
principal
difficulty
in
suing
unions
was
not
procedural
as
it
is
illustrated
in
the
new
york
law
where
there
is
a
statute
making
organizations,
unincorporated
association
suable
in
their
common
name
where
you
can
get
service
on
them.
but
the
substantive
law
of
the
state
that
since
these
organizations
are
not
legal
entities,
all
you
get
when
you
sue
a
union
in
its
common
name
is
in
fact
a
suit
against
all
the
members
and
you
can't
recover
for
a
breach
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
unless
all
of
the
members
are
--
are
guilty
of
that
breach,
because
the
union
per
se
is
not
a
legal
person.
in
other
words,
they
have
construed
their
suit
statute
as
a
procedural
suit,
statute
only
not
changing
the
substantive
rule
of
liability
with
the
respect
to
one
incorporated
associations.
they
discussed
all
of
these
difficulties,
difficulties
in
the
touching
union
assets
even
where
you
can
sue
in
the
state.
and
they
say,
“we
want
to
make
sure
that
both
parties
can
sue
effectively
to
--
to
enforce
collective
bargaining
agreements
to
the
end
that
you
will
have
industrial
peace.”
and
they
say
that
there
are
no
--
now,
no
federal
law
and
this
is
a
quote."
there
are
no
federal
laws
giving
either
an
employer
or
even
the
government
itself
any
right
of
action
for
any
breach
of
these
contracts.”
thus,
there
is
no
quote,
"substantive
right"
to
enforce
in
order
to
make
the
union
suable
as
such
in
federal
courts.
and
then,
they
conclude.
statutory
recognition
of
the
collective
agreement
as
a
valid
binding
and
enforceable
contract
is
a
logical
and
necessary
step.
it
will
promote
a
higher
degree
of
responsibility
upon
the
parties
to
such
agreements
and
will
thereby
promote
industrial
peace.
now,
they
were
talking
about
no-strike
clause,
the
no-strike
arbitration
provision
which
are
really
the
same
clause.
because
their
next
goal
to
meet
the
objection
that
if
they
do
this,
unions
won't
agree
to
no-strike
arbitration
clauses
anymore.
if
unions
are
responsible
in
damages
and
these
suits
can
be
brought
and
there
is
this
statutory
recognition
of
these
contracts
as
enforceable
contracts.
but
they
answered
that
by
saying,
“this
argument
isn't
supported,
in
the
few
states
which
have
enacted
laws,
making
these
contracts
enforceable
in
the
courts.”
four
states
they
say,
“minnesota,
colorado,
wisconsin
and
california,
have
enacted
those
laws.”
and
as
far
as
they
can
determine,
there
has
been
no
decrease
in
the
incidence
of
no-strike
clauses
in
union
contracts.
and
therefore,
they
conclude
that
there
would
not
be
any
decrease
in
the
incidence
of
union
of
no-strike
clauses
if
congress
gave
the
statutory
recognition.
now,
concededly,
the
question
of
whether
an
agreement
to
arbitrate
can
be
specifically
enforced
was
not
discussed
anywhere,
one
way
or
the
other
in
the
legislative
history
of
section
301.
i
think
that
it
is
--
it
necessarily
follows
from
the
purpose
which
congress
was
trying
to
achieve
in
301
that
the
agreements
which
exists
in
90%
of
our
collective
bargaining
agreements
today
that
when
an
employer
takes
action,
he
assigns
a
man
do
a
shift
or
doesn't
assign
him
do
a
shift.
he
gives
him
a
promotion
or
he
doesn't
give
him
a
promotion.
and
the
man
says,
"this
is
in
accordance
with
the
collective
bargaining
agreement."
the
characteristics
of
all,
of
90%
of
american
collective
bargaining
agreements
is
that
the
man
does
what
he
--
what
he's
told
to,
and
i
think
this
is
almost
universal,
and
he
files
a
grievance.
now,
in
this
contract,
it
said
that
these
grievances
shall
not
be
the
subject
of
a
strike,
but
that
they
will
be
handled
through
the
grievance
procedure.
first
discussion
with
this
form
and
then
discussion
with
the
departmental
superintendent
with
the
shop
--
the
departmental
steward
then
at
a
higher
level
between
representatives
of
the
international
union
and
representatives
of
top
management,
and
if
they
don't
agree
on
the
question
then
it
goes
to
arbitration.
you
do
not
achieve
the
purpose
of
promoting
industrial
peace
if
you
say
that
this
agreement
is
not
enforceable
as
congress
said
it
should
be
in
section
301.
now,
we
derived
some
additional
comfort
from
the
history,
which
was
mentioned
briefly
yesterday
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
proposal
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
1947
act.
in
the
senate
bill,
it
was
proposed
to
put
in
section
301
substantially
in
the
form
on
which
it
now
exists,
but
also
to
insert
an
unfair
labor
practice
provision
providing
that
it
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
to
violate
the
terms
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
david
e.
feller
included
both,
but
the
part
which
i
quoted
was
not
in
reference
to
the
unfair
labor
practice
provisions
but
in
reference
to
section
301.
mr.
david
e.
feller
maybe
if
i'm
specific
about
that.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that
is
correct.
but
--
the
--
the
--
that
is
dealt
within
a
separate
section
of
the
report.
the
questions
i
--
the
parts
that
i
quoted
from
quite
clearly
were
dealing
with
section
301.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
in
response
to
that
question
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
it
also
did,
your
honor.
in
a
different
section
of
the
report,
they
discussed
that
and
that's
just
precisely
what
i'm
coming
to.
they
said,
"while
title
iii
of
the
committee
bill."
this
is
after
the
discussions
of
301,
treats
this
subject.
now,
they
add
to
the
earlier
treatment
in
which
they've
discussed
the
right
to
sue
for
breach
of
contract,
“while
title
three,”
which
with
the
section
301
“treats
this
subject
by
giving
both
parties
rights
to
sue
in
the
united
states
district
court.”
the
committee
believes
that
such
action
should
also
be
available
before
an
administrative
body.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that's
right,
in
addition
to.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
think
that
is
correct.
it
was
precisely
as
now
the
--
the
minority
in
the
senate
committee
said,
“hear
now,
if
you're
going
to
make
this
an
unfair
labor
practice,
you're
going
to
have
two
bodies
deciding
the
same
question.”
you're
going
to
have
the
courts
deciding
questions
and
you're
going
to
have
the
national
labor
relations
board
deciding
the
same
question.
and
this
they
said,
“you
will
--
will
lead
to
conflicting
decision
or
rules,”
and
this
is
very
undesirable.
this
being
a
minority
view
was
not
persuasive.
the
majority
went
ahead.
now,
before
i
go
on,
let
me
make
it
clear
that
if
the
unfair
labor
practice
provision
had
been
enacted,
there
is
no
question
that
you
would
get
specific
enforcement,
not
because
they
talked
about
the
question
but
because
the
national
labor
relations
board
by
its
very
nature
issues
cease-and-desist
orders.
it's
not
an
--
it
tells
you
what
to
do
in
the
future.
that's
what
an
unfair
labor
practice
procedure
is
about.
though
nobody,
and
i
will
say
nobody
in
the
house
or
the
senate
recognized
that
there
would
be
any
different
result
if
you
had
a
court
action
or
an
unfair
labor
practice
provision.
they
said
in
the
sentence
which
i
just
quoted
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
you
ought
to
have
two
bodies
who
can
do
this.
now,
the
bill
wants
the
conference.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
submit,
your
honor,
as
the
--
the
persons
involved
at
that
time
considered
that
proposal
as
i
will
immediately
demonstrate.
they
regarded
them
as
concurrent
remedies.
the
minority
view
of
course
is
always
a
suspect
because
it
is
a
minority
view
but
it
became
the
majority
view.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
--
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
you
have
no
--
you
would
have
no
further
statement
of
federal
law
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
provision
which
says,
“it
shall
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
to
violate,
to
breach
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,”
than
you'll
have
--
when
you
have
a
statute
which
says,
“you
can
bring
suit
in
a
federal
court
to
breach
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.”
that's
all
they
said
in
either
section.
now,
where
there's
as
much
federal
law
in
one
case
as
is
there
is
in
the
other.
in
both
cases
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
--
i
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
submit
your
honor
that
the
whole
history
of
--
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
they
--
they
meant
to
do
--
to
say
that
as
i
quoted
the
senate
committee
report,
they
meant
to
give
statutory
recognition
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
as
a
valid
and
enforceable
contract.
mr.
david
e.
feller
yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
if
i
may
answer
that
in
two
parts,
there
is
considerable
uncertainty
or
was
in
the
minds
of
congress
and
i
think
in
the
minds
of
everyone,
well,
in
among
the
various
states
whether
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
a
contract
at
all.
today,
we
talked
about
them
as
contracts.
i
think
that
congress
at
the
minimum,
and
i
don't
have
to
go
very
much
beyond
that
minimum
in
this
case,
meant
to
say
that
you
have
a
place
to
go
and
in
that
place,
you
will
regard
this
document
as
a
binding
contract.
that's
the
only
issue
of
substantive
law
which
i
think
they
discussed
because
they
said
they've
intended
to
do
that.
and
they
said
it
should
be
an
enforceable
contract.
now,
there
are
other
states,
in
kansan
for
example,
a
contract,
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
not
a
contract
at
all.
in
england,
the
contract
of
--
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
not
a
contract
at
all.
in
young
against
canadian
railways,
the
privy
council
said
that
this
is
simply
a
statement
by
the
employer
as
to
what
rules
he
will
apply
and
if
he
doesn't
apply
them,
the
appropriate
remedy
by
the
union
is
to
strike.
now,
precisely,
what
they
wanted
to
do
in
301
is
to
say
it
is
that
they
wanted
to
give
statutory
recognition
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
as
a
contract
of
itself,
not
a
contract
of
employment.
this
is
a
contract
between
the
union,
an
enforceable
contract
between
the
union
as
union
and
the
employer.
now,
i
don't
have
to
go
any
further
from
that
in
saying
that
was
the
cause
--
that
is
the
cause
of
action
which
was
created.
they
said
they
wanted
to
give
a
cause
of
action
for
breaches
of
these
agreements.
now,
if
--
if
i'm
correct
in
this
and
this
is
all
we
have
to
go
in
here
because
in
these
cases,
we
have
no
question.
i
think
under
the
laws
of
the
states,
assuming
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
a
--
is
a
contract,
these
provisions,
agreements
to
arbitrate
are
valid
agreements.
they're
unenforceable
by
virtue
of
a
rule
of
equity
practice
that
agreements
to
arbitrate
are
not
specifically
enforceable.
but
i
think
there
is
no
contention
that
in
any
of
the
states,
agreements
to
arbitrate
are
not
valid
agreements.
that
was
the
common
law
and
that
is
in
--
in
england
and
it
is
the
common
law
in
every
states
so
far
as
i
know.now,
if
you
can
once
get
to
arbitrate
before
he
revokes,
the
award
as
a
binding
award.
you
can't
collect
unfortunately.
the
remedy
almost
obliterates
the
right
because
you
can't
collect
damages
if
he
revokes
it
under
the
common
law
rule.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well
if
--
if
what
is
not
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well
there
are
about
three
questions,
your
honor,
involved
in
your
question
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
and
i'd
like
to
answer
them
all.
one
is
the
assumption
that
the
right
to
get
specific
performance
is
a
question
of
substance.
i
--
i
--
to
tell
you
the
truth,
i
don't
want
to
get
in
to
the
argument
of
what
--
what
substance
and
what's
procedure
as
this
court
in
guaranty
trust
company
against
york
plainly
said.
that
--
that
depends
on
what
purpose
you
ask
that
question
for.
you
can't
say
anything
in
substance
or
procedure
as
a
matter
of
abstract
categories
and
one
of
the
difficulties
in
this
field
is
we
start
talking
about
state
substantive
law
and
federal
law
as
in
abstract
terms
without
asking
what
precise
question
that
you're
going
to
have
resort
to
the
state.
now,
there
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
--
i
did
--
i
was
going
to
put
this
some
place
else.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
want
to
correct
--
no,
i
might
as
well
do
it
now.
i
want
to
correct
the
statement.
we
made
a
two
greater
concession
in
our
brief
which
i'd
like
to
withdraw
now
that
under
the
law
of
maine,
there
is
no
remedy
of
specific
performance
for
an
agreement
for
refusal
to
arbitrate.
we
cited
a
very,
very
old
case
on
that
point.
there
is
a
more
recent
case
which
is
cited
oddly
enough
in
brief
for
the
petitioner
on
page
11
which
i'd
like
to
refer
to
you
now.
the
case
is
lewiston-auburn
shoe
workers
versus
federal
shoe
inc.
it's
cited
on
page
11
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
citation
is
150,
main
432,
114
atlantic
2nd
248.
now,
let
me
hasten
to
add
that
this
case
does
not
say
that
agreements
to
arbitrate
future
disputes
are
enforceable.
all
it
says
is
that
there
is
one
devil
of
a
question
on
this
and
they
don't
have
to
decide
it,
although
the
policy
of
the
state
is
in
favor
of
such
enforcement.
i
think
it's
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
as
i
said
your
honor,
i'm
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
i'm
not
referring
to
the
case
as
a
holding
but
as
your
honor
noticed
in
the
--
in
the
barnhart
case,
a
law
move
sometimes
even
without
statute
particularly
in
the
area
of
arbitration,
and
may
not
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
yes.
well,
i
want
to
--
to
particularly
refer
to
what
the
court
said
in
deciding
and
its
dictum
on
the
whole
argument,
the
holding
in
that
case
just
before
the
award
came
down
but
the
employer
knew
what
the
award
would
be.
he
said,
"i
revoke
the
authority
to
arbitrate."
and
what
the
court
said
is
after
stating
general
proposition
that
arbitration
is
favored
by
the
law
said,
"this
quotation
had
reference
to
commercial
arbitration."
that
it
went
on
to
say
that
the
reasons
for
looking
with
favor
on
arbitration
of
labor
disputes
arising
under
labor
management
contracts
are
far
more
compelling.
it
recites
the
history
of
collective
bargaining
very
much
in
the
terms
incidentally,
though
i
didn't
have
the
case
before
us
when
we
wrote
our
briefs
here
in
which
we
do
in
our
brief.
the
distinction
between
labor
arbitration
and
commercial
arbitration
is
the
objective
of
avoiding
strikes.
and
then
they
conclude,
“the
public
has
a
real
interest
in
the
successive
arbitration
of
labor
management
have
been
disputes
and
some
public
policy
requires
more
than
token
acceptance
of
a
speedy
and
effective
substitute
for
economic
warfare.”
whether
or
not,
this
is
the
crucial
sentence."
this
public
policy
is
so
compelling
as
to
require
judicial
decision
that
arbitration
submission
agreements
under
labor
management
contracts
are
irrevocable
or
whether
the
common
law
rule
applicable
to
commercial
arbitration
in
this
respect
so
controls
in
the
labor
management
field
as
to
require
a
legislation.
if
--
if
ever
applicability
is
to
be
accomplished,
we
need
not
decide
here.
that's
nicely
posing
the
question
which
we
have
here
in
saying
they
won't
decide
it,
but
i
think
that
it
is
perfectly
permissible
and
that
this
court
should
decide
contrary
to
our
intention
--
the
contention
that
as
a
matter
--
that
the
one
thing
you
have
to
draw
and
that's
the
only
thing
we're
saying
here.
the
one
thing
you
have
to
draw
as
to
the
intent
of
congress
in
section
301
is
that
the
agreement
that
there
shall
be
no
strikes
but
that
agreement
shall
be
arbitrated.
it
should
be
enforceable
in
the
federal
courts.
the
court
should
decide
contrary
to
that
contention.
then,
i
think
it
would
be
appropriate
to
remand
this
case
to
the
first
circuit
which
do
not
consider
this
question
because
in
its
view,
the
federal
law
govern
under
the
arbitration
act
to
remand
this
case
to
the
first
circuit
or
to
the
district
court,
so
i
don't
get
into
the
argument
in
the
barnhart
case
for
determination
as
to
what
they
think
the
law
of
maine
on
the
question
is
in
view
of
this
admittedly
dictum
in
the
most
recent
case
in
maine
on
the
subject.
now,
in
our
view,
i
--
before
we
got
off
on
the
questions,
i
was
talking
about
the
unfair
labor
practice
provisions
of
the
act,
which
was
objected
to
in
the
senate
committee
because
the
senate
committee,
the
minority
felt
that
there
would
be
conflict
if
they
allow
both
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
before
the
board
and
a
suit
for
breach
of
contract.
the
bill
was
passed
in
the
senate
and
went
to
conference.
and
there,
the
house
conferees
made
the
same
objection
and
then
senator
taft
explained
it
when
the
conference
report
came
back.
the
house
conferees
objected
to
this
provision,
the
unfair
labor
practice
provision
which
in
the
report
had
been
said
was
an
additional
provision
to
the
--
to
the
principle
of
remedy
given
which
was
the
right
to
sue.
on
the
ground,
it
would
have
the
effect
of
making
the
terms
of
collective
bargaining
agreement
subject
to
interpretation
and
determination
by
the
board
rather
than
by
the
courts.
that's
the
reason
they've
objected.
senator
taft
said
in
concurrence
with
their
view,
“if
both
provisions
had
remained,
there
could
have
been
a
probable
conflict
of
remedies
and
decisions.”
and
therefore,
they
decided
to
eliminate
the
unfair
labor
practice
provision
and
allow
the
section
301
to
remain
in
the
statute
so
you
would
not
have
two
bodies
deciding
the
same
question.
and
they
said
that
in
this
way,
"this
is
the
house
conference
report."
now,
i
had
quoted
from
senator
taft,
"once
parties
have
made
a
collective
bargaining
contract,
the
enforcement
of
that
contract
should
be
left
to
the
usual
process
of
law
and
not
to
the
national
labor
relations
board.”
in
other
words,
the
duty
to
bargain,
the
relationship
between
the
parties
as
they
got
into
the
bargaining
question
representation,
leave
that
to
the
board.once
they
have
a
contract,
let
him
sue
in
court.
now,
if
this
legislative
history
means
anything,
it
means
that
there
was
not
the
slightest
recognition
on
anybody's
part
that
there
would
be
this
vast
difference
in
result
which
would
occur
if
this
court
should
say
that
there
can
be
no
specific
performance
of
the
--
of
the
agreement
to
arbitrate
that
that
remedy
is
not
available
in
the
suit
under
301
because
in
time,
it
would
have
been
available
if
there
had
been
an
unfair
labor
practice.
and
i
submit
there
has
not
the
slightest
suggestion
in
the
committee
report
that
they
did
anything
other
than
decide.
there
should
not
be
two
forms
to
justify
the
same
result.
and
they
decided
for
reasons
best
known
to
themselves
that
they'd
rather
have
us
be
in
court
than
before
the
national
labor
relations
board.
now,
i
think
in
the
course
of
this
discussion,
i
have
made
it
fairly
clear
that
all
we
say
here
on
the
substance
versus
procedure
where
you
look
for
the
substantive
law,
all
we
say
here
is
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
it
must
be
held
consistent
with
what
congress
intended
under
section
301
that
the
agreement
to
arbitrate
can
be
enforced.
and
that's
all
we
say.
mr.
david
e.
feller
in
a
federal
court,
irrespective
of
what
state
law
is
to
the
contrary.
this
is
particularly
true
since
i
think
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
congress
meant
the
agreement
not
to
strike,
which
is
the
counterpart
in
consideration
for
the
agreement
to
arbitrate,
should
be
enforced
irrespective
of
state
law.
now
of
course,
we'd
be
very
happy
if
this
court
said
to
the
contrary
and
not
in
this
case
generally,
but
i
think
it's
fairly
clear
that
unions
opposed
section
301.
we
didn't
want
the
federal
courts
in
here,
but
we
are
being
sued
all
the
time
under
section
301.
and
i'd
never
been
able
to
find
a
court
that
will
give
any
notion
we
use
to
try
the
argument
that
was
unconstitutional.
we
never
got
passed
one
district
judge
on
the
question.
a
couple
of
courts
of
appeals
dismissed
the
argument
abruptly.
we
are
being
sued
for
breach
of
precisely
and
can
be
sued
for
breach
of
precisely
this
kind
of
a
provision.
now,
how
can
you
have
a
position
of
law
that
you
haven't
signed
a
contract
for
two
years?
it
says,
“the
employer
manages
the
plan.
he
makes
the
decisions.
you
agree
and
you
have
to
go
through
the
agreements
and
arbitration
procedure.
if
you
strike,
you
can
be
sued.
but
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
employer
refuses
to
arbitrate,
you
can't
sue
to
get
relief
for
that.
and
that
would
be
precisely
the
posture
that
would
be
created
in
the
great
majority
of
states
which
do
not
enforce
agreements
to
arbitrate
because
they
do
not
give
that
remedy
of
negligence.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
perhaps
i'm
in
error
but
i
think
that
no
fair
reading
and
i
would
love
to
make
an
argument
to
the
contrary,
no
fair
reading
of
what
congress
said
it
meant
to
do.
and
i
don't
want
to
repeat
the
senate
committee
report
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
would
suggest
that
we
can
get
out
of
a
suit
for
damages
when
they
sue
us
for
breach
of
this
--
of
this
clause
in
the
contract.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
--
i
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
should
hesitate
to
--
to
disagree
with
that
statement,
your
honor,
but
the
effect
of
what
you
did
in
westinghouse
and
i
in
view
of
the
time,
i'd
like
not
to
get
into
westinghouse
but
i
can't
refrain
from
making
this
comment.
mr.
david
e.
feller
in
westinghouse,
your
honor
said,
“we
do
not
reach
the
constitutional
question
because
it's
difficult
when
it
comes
to
question.
therefore,
we'll
construe
the
statute
as
not
including
the
suit
by
the
union.
now,
that
doesn't
say
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
and
when
we're
sued,
it
may
be
held
constitutional
and
we're
left
with
no
remedy
because
before
you
decided
that,
you
read
as
out
of
the
statute
to
preserve
--
to
avoid
deciding
the
constitutional
question.
that's
the
only
problem
that
i'm
trying
--
situation
which
i'm
trying
to
avoid
here.
and
this
is
a
very
real
and
possible
difficulty,
as
your
honor
can
recognize
that
many
times,
the
court
avoids
constitutional
questions
by
interpreting
statutes
and
then,
in
later
cases
has
to
meet
them
and
hold
the
statute
is
constitutional.
the
man
who's
left
out
in
the
process
is
left
out.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i'm
only
arguing.
i'm
not
arguing
that
he
--
we
should
be
read
in
where
the
plain
--
where
the
meaning
of
the
statute
as
legislative
history
doesn't
indicate
we
ought
to
be
left
in.
i
only
say
please
don't
leave
us
out
because
your
decision
is
waited
by
a
constitutional
doubt
which
will
later
resolve
in
favor
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
when
the
other
fellow
is
suing
us.
that's
our
only
--
only
position
on
that.
now,
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
no,
i
have
the
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
that
--
that's
my
complaint
but
you
wouldn't
do
that.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
so
i
don't
put
a
light
and
we
see
what
the
point
of
your
argument
is.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
then,
perhaps
i'd
better
avenge.
i
want
to
make
one
other
comment
which
is
in
reference,
and
i
think
it
goes
to
this
substance
and
procedure
thing.
the
question
of
what
substantive
law
governs
in
these
cases
and
i
--
i
want
to
preface
this
by
saying
the
court
does
not
have
to
reach
that
question
here
as
far
as
i
--
i
see
the
decision.
the
court
has
to
read
only
statutory
recognition
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
as
a
valid
and
enforceable
contract.
the
rest
of
the
questions
as
to
the
nature
of
the
agreement
and
the
rights
under
it
can
be
decided
by
state
law
or
federal
law.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference,
but
i
am
--
i
am
certain
that
this
is
enough
of
a
federal
question,
a
federal
law
if
this
is
the
meaning
of
301
to
make
the
statute
constitutional.
i
don't
see
any
constitutional
question.
particularly
in
this
case,
there
is
no
constitutional
question,
in
any
case
in
which
the
state
would
not
enforce
the
agreement,
if
who
you
are
going
to
say
that
the
--
by
virtue
of
301,
you
do
enforce
it
then
the
constitutional
question
disappeared.
the
constitutional
question
arises
only
when
you
say,
“we
will
enforce
it
because
the
state
does,”
and
then
the
question
is
under
article
3
whether
you're
enforcing
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
that
is
correct.
so,
why
do
you
say
it
evaporates
if
you
got
a
state
law?
i
don't
follow
that
at
all.
mr.
david
e.
feller
no,
i
say
it
evaporates
if
you
hold
that
it's
enforceable
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
that's
right.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
we
are
saying
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
we're
saying
that
we
can
--
our
contention
here
is
that
--
is
that
it
is
enforceable
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
and
if
our
contention
is
correct,
then
there
is
no
constitutional
problem.
if
our
contention
is
wrong,
we've
already
lost
the
case.
we
don't
have
to
lose
it
on
any
other
ground.
now,
on
--
if
i
may
talk
very
briefly
on
the
substance
and
procedure
matter,
there
is
--
when
you
talk
about
state
substantive
law
or
federal
substantive
law,
i
think
the
same
rule
that
this
court
specified
in
guaranty
trust
company
against
york
as
to
what
is
procedure
and
what
is
substance.
a
very
wise
rule
to
follow,
what
kind
of
questions
are
you
talking
about
that
are
decided
on
the
--
as
a
matter
of
state
law
or
federal
law?
if
the
--
the
precise
question
is
visualized.
i
think
most
of
the
problems
disappear.
the
problems
are
problems
of
abstraction
and
not
problems
of
reality.
and
i
take
for
an
example
the
question
put
by
mr.
orr
yesterday.
if
the
employer
went
to
arbitration
here,
and
it
was
decided
that
the
vacation
pay
wasn't
due,
he
said,
“the
individuals
could
turn
around
and
sue
in
the
state
court
to
collect
their
vacation
pay.
obviously,
that
isn't
so.
but
why
isn't
it
so?
because
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
not
vague
provisions
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
specific
provisions
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
specific
provision
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
which
enabled
the
union
to
represent
the
employee
and
have
each
decision
binding
on
the
employee
is
the
fact
that
in
section
9
(a)
of
the
act,
congress
said
that
union
shall
be
the
exclusive
collective
bargaining
agency
for
employees
in
appropriate
unit
where
a
majority
so
designated.
and
congress
in
section
8
(d)
said
that
“collective
bargaining
includes
the
negotiation
of
a
contract
and
the
negotiation
of
questions
arising
under
the
contract.”
now,
if
any
suit
is
brought
in
any
court
in
which
this
kind
of
question
is
raised,
there
is
no
question
that
it
has
to
be
resolved
and
should
be
resolved
in
terms
of
the
specific
provisions
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
or
take
another
case.
an
employer
goes
to
an
employee
and
says,
“i
like
you
to
work
overtime.
you
can
use
the
extra
money,
but
how
about
us
making
the
deal
that
we
won't
pay
you
the
overtime
rights
--
rates
specified
in
the
union
contract?”
this
case
is
a
risk.
the
employee
does
the
work
and
then
sues
for
breach
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
for
breach
of
his
right
to
overtime
pay.
what
law
governs?
again,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
national
labor
relations
act,
when
it
said
that
there
shall
be
collective
bargaining,
and
as
this
court
has
held
outlaws
individual
bargains
in
derogation
of
the
collective
bargain
which
the
union
has
made.
that
is
the
law
which
must
govern.
there
are
--
virtually,
every
question
of
law
as
to
which
there
could
be
a
body
of
law.
i'm
not
talking
about
interpretation
of
words
in
the
contract.
that's
a
question
of
law
in
some
sense
but
not
a
question
in
which
there
is
a
body
of
state
or
federal
law
to
which
we
refer
to.
virtually,
every
kind
of
question
which
arises
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
has
reference
to
specific
provisions
in
the
national
labor
relations
act.
is
a
contract
a
valid
contract?
the
national
labor
relations
board
decides
that
question
every
monday,
wednesday
and
friday
in
determining
whether
to
hold
elections,
union
security
clause
with
a
check
off
provision.
if
you
sue
for
the
dues
while
the
national
labor
relations
act
has
specific
provisions
saying,
“what
kind
of
union
security
clause
you
can
have,”
and
specifically
gives
to
the
state
certain
rights
in
regard
to
that.
the
national
labor
relations
board
is
constantly
saying,
“contracts
are
not
bars
to
new
elections
because
the
contract
--
this
contract
provision
is
not
in
conformity
with
the
act.
but
i
would
hesitate
to
go
forward
with
this,
but
there
is
no
question
that
in
suits
for
breach
of
contract,
a
question
where
there
is
a
contract,
whether
it's
a
valid
contract
who's
bound
by
it
besides
of
the
bargaining
unit
would
determine
who's
bound
by
it
are
determined
always,
have
to
be
determined
in
reference
to
the
national
labor
relations
act.
this
section
301
is
part
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
it's
a
compliment
to
the
whole
procedure
requiring
the
parties
to
bargain,
setting
forth
their
duties
to
bargain
which
include
not
only
the
negotiation
of
a
contract
but
the
settlement
of
differences
under
the
contract.
it's
all
set
aligned.
and
i
think
--
in
this
connection,
i
want
to
make
perfectly
clear,
but
i
think
mr.
goldberg
made
clear
yesterday
in
an
answer
to
the
question
about
the
union
loan
to
an
employer
that
on
mature
consideration,
we
would
not
regard
that
as
within
the
scope
of
section
301,
no
more
than
if
a
union
made
a
contract
to
build
a
building
with
a
contractor
who
is
an
employer,
who
had
employees,
who
are
engaged
in
commerce
and
the
union
obviously
represents
the
employees
that
this
building
contract
would
be
subject
to
301.
we're
talking
about
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
--
i
agree,
it's
a
very
--
but
i
--
i
think
we
are
talking
about
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
that
is
one
branch
if
i'm
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
have
time,
i
will
go
to
the
arbitration
act.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that's
right.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that's
right.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that's
correct.
and
he
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
he
affirmed
the
district
court
would
base
it
on
section
301.
mr.
david
e.
feller
oh
that's
correct,
on
this
branch
of
the
case.
mr.
david
e.
feller
now,
we
would
like
also
and
i
will
get
to
that
if
i
may.
i
want
to
say
a
word
about
the
norris-la
guardia
act.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
would
answer
that
if
i
may
so
that
i
don't
forget
it
later.
the
abstract
conceptual
question
of
whether
there
is
a
contract
at
all,
i
would
solve
this
is
my
own
solution.
and
i
--
again,
i
always
ask
what
is
the
practical
significance
of
the
question.
i
would
say
there
is
an
implied
contract
of
employment
with
each
employee.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
in
--
in
that
--
in
that
reference,
because
there
i
think
they
were
talking
about
cases
where
they
were
not
collective
bargaining
agreements.
when
i
get
to
that,
i
will
--
i
will
make
that
argument.
now,
the
norris-la
guardia
act
very
briefly,
if
i
may
your
honors,
the
--
i
would
like
to
say
just
one
thing
in
reference
to
the
norris-la
guardia
act
and
that
is
everybody
talks
about
it
nobody
reads
it.
i
don't
mean
to
be
that
invidious
but
it
sound
invidious
but
the
fact
is
everybody
assumes
the
question
is
whether
is
the
norris-la
guardia
act
applicable
without
saying
what
provision
in
the
norris-la
guardia
act
prevents
you
from
doing
what.
now,
it
is
perfectly
clear
and
i
want
to
--
i
think
this
is
a
caveat
which
i
have
to
make.
we
do
not
argue
that
section
301
repeals
pro
tanto
in
the
norris-la
guardia
act.
it's
perfectly
clear
that
it
did
not,
because
the
house
bill
proposed
to
do
that
and
the
senate
bill
did
not
and
there
are
equivalent
sections
as
to
these
suits
and
in
conference
to
send
it
one.
so,
norris-la
guardia
is
applicable.
it
has
not
been
repealed
sub
silentio
to
this
extent
as
you
had
in
the
railway
labor
act
cases
which
were
decided
yesterday.
the
question
is
what
does
norris-la
guardia
act
do?
section
4
of
the
act
contains
certain
provision,
certain
types
of
activities
which
can
never
be
enjoined
in
the
federal
court.
you
can't
enjoin
a
strike,
picketing,
assistance,
a
list
of
areas
of
conflict
which
these
--
where
the
courts
were
to
stay
out
of
in
the
absence
of
fraud
or
violence.
now,
it's
conceded
that
section
4
has
no
application
here
because
we're
not
asking
for
any
of
the
forbidden
kind
of
injunction.
section
7
says
that
“in
cases
that
no
injunction
shall
be
issued
except
upon
certain
finding.”
now,
the
committee
reports,
a
far
date
of
predeceases
in
this
field
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
section
7
was
a
procedural
section.
it
was
designed
to
setup
a
--
put
procedural
safeguards
and
if
read
in
connection
with
section
4,
again,
it
is
perfectly
clear
they're
talking
about
the
cases
in
which
an
injunction
would
be
barred
under
section
4,
except
for
allegations
of
fraud
or
violence.
and
this
is
the
way
you
show
the
violence.
you
saw
that
police
can't
protect
you
and
you
put
in
all
the
requisites.
since
section
4
has
no
application,
we
think
that
section
7,
the
procedural
section
in
which
you
prove
the
exception
before
has
no
application.
i
think
this
is
--
it
makes
sense
of
all
this
court's
decision
under
the
railway
labor
act
and
the
implied
decisions
in
the
hoffman
case
and
what?
mutuality,
i
want
to
say
one
word
about
the
mutuality
because
i
know
it
will
be
mentioned.
if
as
we
said
the
norris-la
guardia
act
prevents
an
injunction
against
a
strike
and
i
think
even
in
violation
of
a
contract,
i
have
to
make
this
perfectly
fine.
isn't
it
unfair
for
us
to
command
and
ask
for
an
injunction,
injunctive
relief,
equitable
relief
to
enforce
the
agreement
to
arbitrate
when
they
can't
enjoin
us
from
striking.
are
they
going
to
say
that
and
that's
a
perfectly
legitimate
argument
which
judge
magruder
managed
in
the
court
below.
the
answer
is
i
think
very
plain.
they
have
a
remedy
in
damages,
very
substantial
damages,
as
i
can
testify
and
this
court
records
can
testify
for
breach
of
contract
in
the
case
of
a
strike
and
violation
of
the
agreement.
congress
decided
they
should
not
have
an
equitable
remedy
when
it
refused
to
repeal
the
norris-la
guardia
act
as
it
affects
these
statutes.
but
the
union
has
no
remedy,
unless
it
can
get
equitable
relief,
because
damages
do
not
lie
and
cannot
in
their
nature
to
lie
to
enforce
the
agreement
to
arbitrate.
now,
my
white
light
is
on
and
i
want
to
go
to
the
arbitration
act
very
fast.
the
arbitration
act,
which
was
passed
in
1924,
was
meant
to
go
as
far.
the
committee
reports
plainly
reveal
that
they
meant
to
exhaust
the
commerce
power.
so,
transaction
is
a
--
a
contract
evidencing
a
transaction
involving
commerce
in
section
2
of
the
act,
i
think
involving
commerce
has
to
be
read
as
affecting
commerce.
mr.
david
e.
feller
because
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
obviously
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
no,
but
it
means
contracts
of
employment.
mr.
david
e.
feller
yes.
it
means
contracts
of
employment.
mr.
david
e.
feller
now
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
no,
no,
but
the
--
the
--
i'm
answering
the
argument
that
since
a
union
did
this,
they
must
have
met
contracts
of
employment
to
encompass
collective
bargaining
agreement.
my
argument
and
because
as
--
as
the
second
circuit
said
just
the
other
day,
“normally,
individual
workman
don't
sign
contracts
of
employment.”
but
the
point
i'm
making
is
that
the
particular
workers
who
were
concerned
did
sign
contracts
of
employment
and
contracts
of
employment
was
what
they
wanted
to
exempt
here.
mr.
david
e.
feller
no,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
david
e.
feller
but
the
case,
case
tells
us,
i'm
not
arguing
to
read
anything
out
of
the
statute.
i'm
going
to
ask
your
honors
simply
to
read
the
statute
for
what
it
says.
i
--
what
it
says
is
contracts
of
employment.
now,
if
you
read
the
case
--
case,
it
says
that
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
not
a
contract
of
employment.
i
am
answering
the
argument.
mr.
david
e.
feller
precisely
the
contrary,
your
honor.
i
am
asking
you
to
read
contracts
in
1924,
the
distinction
between
contracts
of
employment
and
collective
bargaining
agreements
where
it
might
not
be
nearly
so
clear.
and
i
think
it's
fairly
clear
--
it
was
not
so
clear
as
it
is
today.
i
am
asking
you
to
read
contract
of
employment
as
you
read
it
today,
just
as
i'm
asking
you
to
read
involving
commerce
as
you
read
it
today.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
think
that
that's
probably
true.
mr.
david
e.
feller
thank
you.
