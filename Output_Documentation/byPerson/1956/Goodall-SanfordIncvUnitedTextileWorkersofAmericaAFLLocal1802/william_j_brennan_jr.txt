justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
it's
important
that
those
issues
were
lost
in
arbitration
if
arbitration
is
directed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
well,
i
mean
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
--
but
the
fact
of
the
amount
involved
has
no
bearing
in
what
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
--
i
don't
follow
what
--
what
the
relevance
here,
of
this
argument
to
the
issue.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
the
fact
--
the
fact
that
your
client
voluntarily,
i
suppose,
signed
an
agreement
to
arbitrate
something.
and
the
only
problem
before
us
is
whether
your
client
shall
be
required
to
arbitrate
that
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
something
--
that's
something
else
again.
but
what
may
be
the
outcome
of
an
arbitration
if
you
are
required
to
arbitrate?
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
bear
at
all
upon
the
question
whether
you
shall
be
required
to
arbitrate.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
perhaps
you
have
a
point
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
but
i
still
haven't
caught
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
think
so,
but
go
on.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
but
the
point
--
the
only
point
i'm
making
is
that
you
made
an
agreement
to
arbitrate.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
well,
now
did
you
make
it
with
an
understanding
that
it
was
never
enforceable
under
the
law
of
maine?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
but
now
having
agreed
to
it,
your
point
is
nevertheless
maine
law
says
it's
unenforceable?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
now
what
importance
is
it
how
it
may
come
out
if
in
fact
you're
required
to
arbitrate
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
under
federal
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
a
state
law
is
and
it's
unenforceable
and
we
have
to
enforce
state
law
then
you're
not
to
be
required
to
arbitrate.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
what
difference
does
it
make?
how
it
may
come
out
if
you
are
required
to
arbitrate?
that's
what
i
don't
follow.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
why
you're
lose.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
why
you're
losing.
