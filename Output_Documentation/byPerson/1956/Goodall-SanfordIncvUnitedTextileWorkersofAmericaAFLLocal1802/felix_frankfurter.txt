justice

why
do
you
call

of

justice

may
i
(inaudible)
you,
mr.

what
are
you
reading

what
(voice

--
justice

what's
the
name?
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you.
justice
felix

do
i
understand
you
(inaudible)
only
in
15
states
may
an
agreement
that
--
that
in
all
but
15
states,
an
agreement
to
arbitrate
may
be
spoken
without
being
enforced?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
for
me
to
question
the
yale,
i'm
certain.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
some
of
the
circuit
courts
had
said
even
if
arbitration
is
to
be
directed,
you
have
to
enforce
state
arbitration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
you
are
in
the
federal
court
out
of
--
on
federal
jurisdiction
and
not
diversity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
suggest
that
it
doesn't
do
losing
but
still
on
the
decisions
of
the
courts.
justice

can
we
get
the
judgment,
the
actual
judgment
in
this
case
in
the
record,
mr.

justice

where
is
it?.
don't

don't
take
it

justice

on
page

justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you
very
much.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
if
--
if
breach
of
a
contract,
the
collective
agreement
had
been
an
unfair
labor
practice
were
included
among
the
unfair
labor
practices,
then
you
would
have
a
statute
of
the
united
states?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
relief
under
it
would
be
relief
under
--
arising
under
the
law,
a
law
of
the
united
states
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
deriving
a
law
of
the
united
states
means
a
statute,
doesn't
mean
a
hodgepodge
philosophy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
doesn't
foreclose.
that
doesn't
--
in
fact,
what
--
what
congress
had
in
mind,
or
so
we
find
that,
it
doesn't
contract
the
appropriate
scope
of
the
language
of
the
statute
to
something
larger
than
what
they
predominantly
had
in
mind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
have
the
common
place
in
legislation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
specific
evil
or
specific
concern,
gives
rise
to
legislation
but
the
language
of
the
legislation
may
not
be
restricted
to
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
historical
source.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
i
--
would
you
mind
repeating
that
last
point,
individuals?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
didn't
--
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i--
i
don't
know
anything
about
it.
but
i
suppose
if
the
arbitration,
if
the
award,
the
arbitral
award
--
it's
the
normal
thing,
is
it
not,
that
the
arbitral's
award
requires
enforcement
in
the
courts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
i
suppose
that
subject
that
i
(inaudible)
really
to
thinking
that
the
test
may
be
too
much
if
the
arbitrator
merely
did
hand
down
an
award
and
nothing
happened.
i
suppose
res
judicata
as
you
say
would
not
apply.
but
i
don't
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
mean
the
other
way
around?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
--
he
throws
them
out.
he
throws
them
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
steel
case
been
reported
mr.
orr
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
steel
case
of
the
seventh
circuit
--
the
steel
case
been
reported
in
the
--
in
the
federal
before
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
that's
--
is
this
to
be
(inaudible)
not
in
federal
employees.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
that's
--
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
not
look,
but
do
not
be
lost
in
the
race
of
these
cases
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
of
course.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
report
from
which
you
quoted
related
to
a
bill
which
included
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
saying
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
i
know,
but
the
bill
to
which
the
report
of
address
had
a
provision
making
violation
of
a
contract,
an
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can't
say
everything
in
a
sentence
or
in
a
paragraph.
and
we've
heard
they'd
argued
and
quite
corrected
that
you
must
take
the
taft-hartley
act
as
an
entire
brief.
it's
from
that,
that
it
is
suggested
you
draw
the
basis
of
law.
what
i'm
now
suggesting
is
the
report
which
you
read,
the
extract
which
you
read
dealt
with
a
bill
which
had
any
of
the
provision
making
violation
of
a
contract
an
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
also,
i
take
it
means
that
it's
already
treated
in
another
connection
in
the
trial
part
of
the
report,
also,
in
an
addition
to
and
not
a
different
from.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you
had
that
too,
if
you
had
that
too,
it
wouldn't
follow
that
you
could
dispense
regarding
to
the
administrative
board
first
before
you
enter
into
a
court
anymore
than
under
the
interstate
commerce
act.
you
can
dispense
going
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
before
you
begin
reparation
proceedings.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
so
--
but
the
fact
that
they‘re
concurrent
doesn't
be
tracked
from
the
significance
of
having
a
specific
provision
of
law,
meaning
by
law
of
statute
in
this
case
that
the
--
constitutionally,
by
the
law
of
the
united
states.
but
you
would've
had
a
specific
statute
recognizing
a
substantive
law,
a
right
created
by
the
--
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states
within
commerce
power
making
a
breach
of
that
provision
of
the
contract,
a
federal
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
so
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
did
now
stand,
really
says
that
you
can
bring
suit
against
an
incorporated
organization
on
a
contract.
it
doesn't
make
breach
of
contract.
it
doesn't
determine
what
the
contract
is.
it
doesn't
make
breach
of
contract
of
federal
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
thing
to
say,
you
can
go
to
a
court
and
find
another
thing
to
know,
what
you
go
to
court
for?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
case
--
if
the
case
really
holds
and
--
i'll
just
put
my
eye
on
the
paragraph
which
you
call
attention.
if
the
case
really
holds
what
it
said
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
that's
quite
a
common
thing
that
if
the
arbitration
actually
has
gone
underway,
the
case
make
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
good
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
glad
you
accept
that
view
but
it
didn't
permit
itself
to
my
brother.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
of
course,
if
301
doesn't
allow
us
--
doesn't
create
substantive
right
and
doesn't
in
and
of
itself
--
to
be
is
not
in
and
of
itself
a
law
so
that
cases
arrives
under
that
law.
it
can't
be
enforced
against
union
if
it
can't
be
enforced
--
it
can't
be
enforced
against
union
but
it
can
be
enforced
by
union.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
prove
that
it
can
be
enforced
by
union
by
assuming
it
can
be
enforced
against
unions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
not
saying
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
i
can't
imagine
anybody
who
will
argue
that
if
it
--
it
has
substantive
law
and
it's
a
law
that
for
cases
arriving
under
it
satisfies
the
constitutional
requirement
and
suits
against
you
but
not
suits
by
you.
i
can't
imagine
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
anybody
would
argue
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
you
don't
prove
that
it's
valid
by
saying
some
suits
have
been
held
against
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
can
the
state
come
into
westinghouse?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he's
left
out
because
the
statute
doesn't
cover
him.
no
amount
of
subsequent
determination
of
constitutionality
can
change
the
content
of
a
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
don't
suppose
that
it's
clearly
held
constitutional.
we'd
say,
now
that
the
constitutional
doubt
has
been
resolved
in
favor
of
constitutionality,
we'd
go
back
and
read
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
we
left
out
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
if
that's
in
--
unavoidable
in
--
in
our
system
of
law
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
where
we
have
first
to
construe
and
then
determine
constitutionality.
justice
felix
frankfurter
again,
i
can't
follow
you.
the
fact
that
you
may
have
an
enforceable
right
under
a
state
law
does
not
ipso
facto
give
a
federal
court
the
right
to
enforce
that
state
law
except
in
diversity
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
of
course
it
does
and
there's
no
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
this
controversy
is
about.
that's
what
someone
is
worrying
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
just
tell
us
there's
no
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
feller
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that's
a
very
different
situation
because
certainly,
301
relates
to
employer-employee
relation
and
not
employees
of
one
employer
in
relation
to
the
employer
of
another
set
of
employees.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
ask
you
this
question
before
you
sit
down?
unless
i
misapprehend
your
argument,
you
--
you're
drawing
the
right
of
your
relief
in
this
case
out
of
301,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
you
argue
that,
that
supply
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
being
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
argued
therefore,
you
--
you
have
a
right
of
course.
you
argued
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
first
court
of
--
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
a
ground
which
judge
magruder
for
the
court
rejected,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
affirm
about
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
i
just
want
to
be
clear
about
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
get
to
that
i
just
--
in
connection
with
as
it
were,
as
you're
coming
to
arbitration.
you
were
--
a
little
while
ago
referred
to
the
decision
of
this
court
holding
that
where
there
is
an
outstanding
collective
agreement,
the
employer
is
barred
for
making
an
individual
contract
of
employment,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
would
like
to
ask
you
either
directly
in
answer
to
my
question,
to
my
puzzles
and
topic
tackled
by
judge
magruder
or
when
you
come
to
it.
if
you
have
no
individual
contract
of
employment
when
you
have
a
contract
of
collective
bargain,
the
collective
agreement
is
there
no
contract
of
employment
at
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
isn't
that
the
direct
question
because
the
arbitration
statute
compelled
me
to
face
it
and
compelled
you
to
face
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
--
it
does
compel
me
to
face
it
and
--
but
isn't
that
a
statutory?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
does
it
have
to?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
get
--
so
read
it
in
the
federal
trade
commission
act
cases.
well,
i
think
that
a
fair
reading
that
congress
used
language
which
it
thought
exhausted
the
power
of
commerce,
the
congress
to
deal
with
commerce
as
it
understood
the
constitution
in
24,
i
think
a
fair
handling
today
of
what
it's
intended
to
do
would
be
the
say
that
since
our
commerce
conception
has
expanded,
you
should
give
validity
to
congress'
intention,
as
far
as
the
breadth
for
the
statute
which
it
intended
to
pass.
second,
the
exemption
in
section
1
of
contracts
of
employment,
this
is
a
very
curious
thing
because
this
exemption
was
the
creature
of
one
man,
andrew
furuseth.
there's
no
question
that
this
exemption
was
inserted
at
the
request
of
the
international
seamen's
union
and
it
is
so
stated
in
the
hearings.
and
it
is
always
been
assumed
that
since
unions
as
to
exempt
contracts
of
employment,
what
they
were
talking
about
were
collective
bargaining
agreements.
and
i
think
due
to
counsel
for
the
company
in
general
electric,
the
next
case
who
indicated
that
the
source
material
was
available,
everybody
is
going
to
the
proceedings
of
the
international
seamen's
union
and
investigated
the
international
seamen's
union
and
try
to
find
out
what
mr.
furuseth
was
talking
about.
and
he
was
talking
about
one
thing,
shipping
orders.
the
individual
contracts
of
employment
which
every
sailor
has
to
sign
which
as
of
the
time,
this
statute
was
passed,
it
had
arbitration
clauses
in
them.
and
under
the
maritime
law,
a
seaman
has
the
right
to
leave
a
ship
under
certain
conditions
and
mr.
furuseth
said,
“they're
going
to
arbitrate
before
a
shipping
commissioner
on
your
right
and
they're
going
to
make
you
stay
on
your
ship,
and
they're
going
to
deprive
your
right
to
go
to
law.”
they
were
talking
about
what
they
said
they
were
talking,
and
that
is
contracts
of
employment,
the
kind
of
contract
you
have
in
the
barnhart
case
where
you
don't
have
a
union.
an
agreement
to
serve
in
the
seamen's
union
in
a
resolution
entitled
“compulsory
labor,”
said
that
“if
i
man
signs
these
articles,
he
will
be
compelled
to
serve
and
stay
on
the
ship,”
and
therefore
we
oppose
this
bill
as
it
was
introduced.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
couldn't
be
restricted,
no
doubt
you're
right
of
course,
if
--
if
mr.
furuseth
will
be
spearheaded
that
he
was
then
almost
--
one
of
the
most
powerful
leader
said
they
want
the
most
--
perhaps
the
most
effective
but
it
wasn't
restricted
to
seamen's
articles,
seamen,
railroad,
contract
of
employment
of
seamen,
railroad
employees
or
any
other
class
of
worker.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
doesn't
mean
seamen.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
doesn't
use
plural
article
to
seamen.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
don't
say
it's
restricted
to
what
a
seaman
revokes
to
be
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
didn't
--
the
statute
didn't
restricted
to
that
class
and
therefore
you
read
out
stuff
that's
in
there
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
read
out
--
you
read
out
to
me
the
legal
contractual
means
by
which
millions
and
millions
as
judge
magruder
himself
indicates.
millions
and
millions
of
millions
of
employees
have
their
status
of
employee
and
their
terms
of
employment
by
virtue
of
this
collective
agreement
and
they
couldn't
have
it
individually
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
the
trade
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
doing
this
answering
the
argument
that
they
must
have
an
intended
contracts
of
--
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
to
be
covered
because
it
was
a
union
that
asked
for
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
just
asked
us
to
