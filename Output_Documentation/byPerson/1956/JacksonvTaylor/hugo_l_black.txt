suppose
it's
sent
back
and
the
court-martial
sentences
to
10
years.
what's
your
position
that
could
file
to
the
board
of
review?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they've
said
they
wanted
to
be
20
years?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
agreement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
agreement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
has
that
been
the
rule?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it
wanted
too.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it
wanted
too.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
why
would
he
send
it
back?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
statute
advises
that?
does
the
statute
advise
it
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
do
not
want
to
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
up
to
this
time
as
i
recall
it,
it
had
been
done
in
several
instances.
i
think
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
this
court
had
a
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
sent
back
before
that
because
the
sentence
was
deemed
to
be
inadequate.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
by
modify
of
reviews?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
ask
this
question
because
you
continuously
said
modify
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
you
meant,
by
modify
reviews.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
not
modified
by
increase.
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
viewed
the
statutory
change?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
those
changes,
those
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
provisions
are
subject
to
change
by
statute
to
go
back
to
the
whole
other
opinion
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
not
the
congress,
however,
make
the
--
the
senates
fixed
by
the
court-martial
final,
completely
final,
insofar
as
its
top
limits
are
concern?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
here,
you
have
a
case
where
they
did
not
--
we're
not
free
to
fix
the
top
limit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
a
--
however,
if
the
normal
court
order
below,
and
intended
below,
normally
was
to
make
the
--
it
was,
was
it
not,
normally
to
make
the
findings
of
the
court-martial
final
as
to
the
top
limits.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
this
is
not
a
--
this
is
not
the
normal
is
it?
this
situation
we
have
here
is
an
exception
of
findings.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but,
they
did
--
but
i
was
not
asking
it.
what
i
don't
see
how
we
can
say
that
congress
intended
one
way
or
another
on
this
particular
thing,
but
it
seems
to
me
we
can
say
that
congress
did
intend
to
make
the
top
limit
fixed
by
the
court-martial,
a
normal
top
limit
that
could
ever
be
imposed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
can't
say,
he
can,
with
--
with
finality
that
we
know
that
the
court-martial
could
not,
it
would
not
have
imposed
anything
more
than
20
years
on
these
people.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
wouldn't
bother
you
much
because
they'd
acquiesce
before
you
leave
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
sole
history
of
the
legislation
that
we
have
that
will
show
light
on
the
problem
we
have
before
us?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
anything
in
the
hearing
or
the
reports
of
any
kind
that
discussed
this
particular
title
or
situations
we
have
before
us
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
but
i
want
to
be
sure.
