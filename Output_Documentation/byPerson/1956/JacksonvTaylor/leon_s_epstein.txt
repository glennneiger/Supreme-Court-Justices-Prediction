mr.
leon
s.
epstein
yes,
if
it
please
the
court.
i'll
try
not
to
be
repetitious,
but
as
we
didn't
have
much
time
to
consolidate
our
argument,
there
may
be
certain
repetition
in
it
and
that
is
consolidated
cases.
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
i
represent
--
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
--
the
defendant,
fowler
--
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
--
and
we
came
before
this
court
on
a
little
bit
different
theory
of
law
and
it
must
have
been
substring.
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
yes,
sir.
it's
case
number
620.
i'd
like
to
go
back
over
the
facts
just
a
little
bit
in
this
case
without
going
into
too
much
detail
and
state
to
the
court
what
actually
happened.
fowler,
along
with
defendant,
de
coster
and
defendant
jackson,
was
convicted
by
a
court-martial
in
korea.
the
brief
facts
of
the
case,
which
i
deem
is
important
is
this.
fowler,
de
coster,
and
jackson
left
their
post
of
duty
pursuing
one
of
the
things
a
man
in
the
service
might
want
sometime,
a
little
extracurricular
activity.
in
such,
they
came
upon
a
house
in
korea
and
i
believe
the
court-martial
procedure
which
is
part
of
an
exhibit
in
this
court
shows
that
jackson
and
de
coster
went
into
the
house
and
fowler
stayed
outside
of
a
house
and
it
found
more
or
less
his
participation
in
this
was
--
is
a
bystander
or
as
the
record
says,
he
stood
guard
in
it.
the
degree
of
guilt
in
the
case
varied
considerably.
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
yes
--
yes,
sir.
well,
you
might
call
it
a
home.
it
was
outside
the
evidence.
it
was
more
of
a
shack.
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
they
--
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
well
--
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
--
it
was
a
habitat
for
something.
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
let's
put
it
--
it
was
a
habitat
for
something.
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
i'm
--
i'm
getting
a
little
bit
outside
of
the
evidence
if
i
do
go
into
that
and
i
didn't
care
for
the
court
to
do
it.
it
was
in
a
district
there
where
there
were
certain
shacks
and
certain
things
going
on
that
wouldn't
ordinarily
go
on
in
a
regular
neighborhood.
well
--
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
i
don't
want
to
retrial
the
case.
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
yes,
sir.
i'm
trying
to
infer
that,
but
it's
outside
of
the
record
and
i
didn't
want
to
--
the
record
doesn't
show
that
and
i
didn't
want
to
get
outside
of
the
record.
well,
fowler
stayed
outside
and
these
actions
took
place
between
de
coster
and
jackson.
they're
doing
their
escapade
and
some
koreans
came
and
ran
them
all.
there
was
an
exchange
of
fire.
the
koreans
fired
at
them.
i
believe
they
say
they
fired
back
in
the
air
across
the
creek
and
ran
back
to
their
base.
the
next
morning,
this
woman
was
found
dead.
it
wasn't
shown
whether
the
so-called
rescue
has
killed
her,
whether
somebody
else
killed
her,
or
in
my
mind,
was
never
shown
conclusively
if
it
was
even
the
same
woman.
but
it
was
in
the
same
area
and
the
woman
who
they
found,
according
to
the
medical
testimony,
in
the
brief,
in
the
court-martial,
had
actually
been
raped.
the
evidence
in
this
case
showed
that
de
coster,
who
is
the
only
one
that
tried
to
rape
her,
admitted
that
he
tried
to
have
intercourse
with
her
but
wasn't
able
to
because
of
his
degree
of
intoxication.
the
court-martial
was
properly
convened
in
the
case,
and
all
three
were
convicted
of
murder,
including
fowler
who
stayed
on
the
outside
of
that
car
an
attempted
rape.
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
yes,
sir.
they
found
a
bullet.
there
was
an
exchange
of
fire
and
they
found
a
bullet
wound
in
her
head.
that's
how
she
died.
there
--
should
i
adhere,
this
was
in
a
combat
area
too
where
firing
would,
under
the
circumstances,
take
place.
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
this
has
happened
in
a
combat
area.
this
was
in
the
korean
conflict
--
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
--
where
firing
could
ordinarily
take
place
through
gorilla
activity
and
other.
now,
the
court-martial
was
properly
convened
and
all
three
were
found
guilty
of
murder
and
attempted
rape.
the
minimum
sentence
for
the
murder
was
life
imprisonment.
the
minimum
sentence
for
attempted
rape
has
no
minimum.
the
maximum
was
20
years,
and
the
difficulty
in
our
sentence
comes
here
now.
when
these
boys
were
found
guilty
of
the
murder,
the
courts-martial
lost
any
discretion
in
--
as
to
how
much
time
they
could
give
for
attempted
rape.
if
they
wanted
to
on
the
facts
in
the
attempted
rape
case,
they
didn't
have
to
give
fowler
anything.
they
didn't
have
to
give
jackson
anything.
they
didn't
have
to
give
de
coster
anything.
but
because
of
the
finding
on
a
guilty
of
murder,
they
had
to
give
all
three
of
them
life.
the
sentence
went
up
to
the
board
of
review
through
proper
channels
and
the
board
of
review
says,
"there
was
not
enough
evidence
in
the
case
to
show
you
were
guilty
of
the
murder."
in
saying
that,
they
could
have
said
somebody
else
killed
when
you
weren't
even
there.
all
the
evidence
in
this
case
showed
was
that
he
was
guilty
of
attempted
rape.
then,
they
go
to
describe
the
viciousness
of
the
crime
and
say,
"within
20
years,
an
appropriate
sentence."
then,
in
their
body
of
opinion,
they
say,
"we
remit
so
much
of
the
life
sentence
that
as
an
excess
of
20
years
void."
the
army
says,
"that's
the
proper
procedure."
we
say
it's
not
and
this
is
whack.
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
as
we
are
not
attacking,
i'm
not,
in
this
particular
sense,
sets
up
three
steps
before
a
man
can
be
sentenced
properly.
it
says,
"the
courts-martial
that
hears
the
case
sentences
which
couldn't
be
done
in
this
case
and
they
exercised
their
discretion
as
to
how
much
time
he'll
get.
then,
the
convening
authority,
the
commanding
general
approves
it,
then
it
sent
to
the
board
of
review
for
a
final
determination.
now,
if
in
this
case,
we
let
the
board
of
review
sentence
this
man,
what
happens?
the
board
of
review
has
set
there
as
a
court-martial
on
the
particular
case,
and
then
he's
lost
two
rights
of
clemency.
number
one,
the
right
for
the
commanding
general
will
say
it
wasn't
that
serious.
and
number
two,
for
the
board
or
somebody
to
appear
before
the
board
of
review
and
try
to
get
the
crime
lessened.
in
this
particular
case,
there
were
certainly
degrees
of
guilt
in
it.
the
man
that
actually
commits
the
crime
of
attempted
rape
and
the
man
that
stands
guard
or
stand
outside
and
waits
for
him,
there
are
certain
degrees
of
guilt.
in
this
particular
case,
that
could
not
be
that
shown
in
any
term
of
the
proceeding
because
the
board
of
review
took
up
a
total
record
and
decided
it.
now,
the
government
made
a
contention
that
says,
"what's
the
difference
if
we
send
it
down
to
a
new
board
for
a
resentence
and
let
this
board
of
review
decide
upon
the
sentence?”
then,
we
still
got
a
new
bunch
of
officers
decide
and
how
much
time
he
could
get.
but
the
reason
that
argument
is
of
no
avail,
because
if
it
went
back,
he
would
have
two
more
steps
of
commutation
which
he
has
lost,
which
is
a
substantive
right
in
this
case.
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
yes,
sir.
whether
or
not,
that
board
of
review
under
these
particular
set
of
circumstances
had
the
authority
to
issue
a
sentence
in
this
case.
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
i
believe
on
the
question
of
--
of
character
and
how
--
and
appropriateness
of
sentence,
it
would
have
been.
on
the
issue
of
guilt,
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
the
--
the
board
of
review
could,
your
honor,
except
for
this
one
thing.
it
loses
the
--
the
defendant
his
right
for
two
clemency
appeals
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
and
that's
where
we
run
into
the
difficulty.
if
there
were
still
two
more
clemency
appeals,
then
we
would
have
a
good
situation.
now,
go
--
go
ahead,
sir.
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
the
government
in
their
brief,
for
the
first
time
since
the
solicitor
general's
office
has
it,
says
the
board
of
review
actually
has
the
power,
the
way
i
read
it,
to
impose
this
sentence.
now,
when
colonel
cortez
of
the
army
was
arguing
with
me
about
the
case,
the
army
maintained
this
board
of
review
never
had
the
power
to
impose
the
sentence
and
nobody
in
the
army
feels
like
they
have
the
power
to
impose
the
sentence.
that
they
only
remitted
the
sentence,
that
it
was
one
of
those
cases
that
we
could
apply
in
hype,
which
hype
we're
going
to
have,
this
hype
or
that
hype.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
under
these
circumstances,
they
did
impose
the
sentence
because
the
original
trial
court
did
not
have
any
discretionary
powers
in
determining
what
the
sentence
ought
to
be.
now
--
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
the
board
of
review
can
look
at
it
and
approve
it
if
they
could
say,
“this
man
has
been
imprisoned
already
for
six
years.
we
think
that's
enough
time
for
him
to
serve
under
this
time,
we
cut
at
the
time
served.”
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
they
wouldn't
have
the
authority
to
raise
it
on
any
circumstances.
now,
in
trial
court,
when
judge
hooper
decided
this
case
in
our
favor,
i
believe
you
decide
it
on
a
basis
of
one
question.
he
asked
colonel
cortez
and
captain
smith's
army.
he
said,
"colonel,
and
captain,
can
either
of
you
gentlemen
tell
me
how
much
sentence
that
original
court-martial
would
have
given
this
man,
had
he
been
found
not
guilty
of
murder
as
the
board
of
review
said
he
should
have
been?”
and
both
of
them
says,
"we
don't
know."
the
record
don't
disclose
it,
and
that's
the
same
position
we're
in
right
now.
they
might
have
given
him
20
years.
i
grant
you.
they
might
not
have
given
him
anything,
but
we
don't
know
and
the
board
of
review
didn't
know.
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
oh,
all
right.could
i
answer
that
your
honor
in
saying
this?
it's
not
a
failure
on
the
part
of
our
defendant,
but
it's
a
failure
on
the
part
of
the
congressional
and
practice
procedure
in
itself
not
to
provide
for
it.
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
we
have
raised
that
issue.
we've
raised
the
issue
that
if
congress
had
left,
the
board
of
review
actually
resentenced
the
man
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
yes,
sir,
it's
in
our
original
pleadings.
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
and
it
--
in
other
words,
we
will
reverse.
i
believe
we
will
limit
it
to
the
gross
sentence
question,
but
i
believe
it
grows
out
of
it.
i
believe
this
court
would
hold
it
was
repugnant
to
due
process
to
let
a
man
who
is
tried
5,000
miles
away,
had
his
record
be
sent
to
washington
by
a
different
board
to
decide
how
much
time
he
is
to
serve.
i
know
under
the
federal
system
of
justice,
if
this
same
case
would
prevail,
they
would
have
been
sent
back
to
the
trial
judge
for
a
resentence
and
if
the
trial
judge
died,
in
the
meantime,
to
a
new
judge.
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
well
--
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
well
--
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
if
--
if
it
please
the
court,
i
believe
in
the
burns
case
in
which
you
wrote
a
descending
opinion
or
--
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
but
you
raised
those
--
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
s--
very
questions
as
to
whether
or
not
a
soldier
has
any
rights
under
due
process
in
law
and
if
they
--
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
but,
if
it
please
the
court,
if
it
is
impossible,
why
does
a
procedure
have
to
be
such
that
it
has
to
be
sent
back?
in
other
words,
it
is
a
--
is
this
procedure
that
requires
that
it
has
to
be
sent
back
for
justice
if
it's
impossible
have
to
be
followed
if
an
ultimate
procedure
would
be
available
and
--
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
we
feel
like
--
yes,
sir.
under
the
code,
it
could
be
sent
back
to
a
fresh
court-martial
for
the
purposes
of
resentencing.
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
no,
sir.
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
in
other
words,
when
the
board
of
review
--
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
no,
sir.
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
that
in
this
particular
case,
when
they
issued
a
sentence,
that
sentence
was
void
and
that
it
was
not
contained
in
the
original
sentence
and
if
it
was,
they
had
no
way
of
knowing
it.
in
other
words,
under
a
gross
sentence
rule,
a
gross
sentence
can
be
divided
if
divisible.
that
if
divisible
is
a
keyword,
was
this
sentence
divisible?
was
there
any
way
in
creation
and
know
that
it
was
divisible
without
going
back?
now,
if
it
was
not
divisible,
why
couldn't
it
be
sent
back
to
a
court-martial
and
give
these
two
defendants
their
two
rights
of
clemency
as
we
are
asking?
in
other
words,
if
it
goes
back
to
an
original
court-martial,
we
can
make
a
plea
for
anything
we
won't
do
in
there.
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
if
it
please
the
court.
i
can
say
this
about
the
board
of
review.
in
a
murder
conviction,
that's
automatic.
counsel
was
appointed
by
the
army
to
defend
the
man.
he
is
paid
to
the
army
to
defend
him,
automatic
because
they
picked
up
the
record
and
they
go
through
with
it.
this
man,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
says
nothing
to
the
board
of
review.
he
only
reads
the
results.
he's
never
given
an
opportunity
to
face
the
board
of
review
and
say,
"i've
been
a
good
soldier.
i've
been
in
the
army
for
six
years
and
i've
never
been
--
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
his
--
his
attorney
present
--
presents
the
case
before
who's
an
army
attorney
but
the
man
himself
has
no
opportunity
to
show
his
character.
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
yes,
it's
--
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
but
--
yes,
it
--
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
it's
mandatory
under
the
statute.
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
that
he'd
be
represented.
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
yes,
sir.
we
want
--
we
want
those
other
two
rights
that
he
didn't
have.
in
other
words,
we
feel
this
way.
suppose
in
the
higher
court,
the
board
of
military
appeals
--
the
court
of
military
appeals
would
have
been
the
ones
to
say
that
there
was
not
enough
evidence
to
substantiate
a
conviction.
they
have
no
clemency
power,
the
board
of
military
appeals.
suppose
in
--
they
were
the
ones
that
said
it,
“could
that
board
have
been
separated
those
sentences
and
say
in
20
years
here
was
for
attempted
rape?”
we
don't
know
that,
and
we
would
like
to
get
back
to
somebody
who
could
exercise
a
discretionary
power,
who
could
say,
"yes.
now,
we
have
the
case.
you've
been
convicted
of
attempted
rape.
what
will
we
give
you?”
and
then,
they
can
say,
“we
can
give
you
anything
from
zero
to
20
years.
what
do
you
deserve?”
and
then,
after
they
make
that
initial
determination
of
what
they
feel
they
deserve,
then
he'd
go
before
his
commanding
general
and
he
can
say,
“he's
been
a
good
soldier.
he's
never
been
in
trouble
in
six
years,
maybe
it
ought
to
be
last,”
so
maybe
his
commanding
general
cut
it
in
half.
mr.
leon
s.
epstein
that's
correct.
