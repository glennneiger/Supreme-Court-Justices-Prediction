mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
represent
another
defendant
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
anyway,
don't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
said
they
went
into
a
house.
you
mean,
went
into
someone's
home?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
was
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
a
habitat
for
a
family
anyway.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
do
you
--
do
you
mean
it's
something
distinguished
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
your
--
your
--
are
you
trying
to
--
trying
to
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
it
was
a
house
of
prostitution
as
distinguished
from
a
home.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
the
woman
shot?
is
that
the
way
she
died?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
spritzer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
find
the
fact
of
guilt?
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
spritzer,
the
thing
that's
bothering
me
is
this.
the
--
the
court-martial,
in
sentencing
this
man,
sentenced
him
or
sentenced
these
three
men
for
--
mandatory
for
life
imprisonment.
it
could
have
given
them
a
death
sentence
but
it
didn't.
so
consequently,
it
could
not
make
any
differentiation
between
them
on
the
question
of
murder.
they
all
had
to
be
first
degree
murder
with
life
didn't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
now,
what
is
there
in
the
record
to
--
to
show
what
they
might
have
done
if
they
had
felt
that
they
where
not
guilty
of
--
of
murder,
but
were
only
guilty
of
the
attempted
rape,
where
they
could
have
decided
that
one
should
get
20
years,
another
one
should
get
10
and
another
one
should
get
five,
let
us
--
let
us
say?
is
there
anything
in
there
that
would
indicate
that
they
did
take
those
things
into
consideration?
and
if
there
is
not
or
--
or
if
they
did
may,
how
can
we
say
that
the
reviewing
board
is
not
increasing
the
punishment
that
they
intended
to
--
to
give
for
that
offense
when
the
conviction
of
murder
was
set
aside?
i
presume
we've
got
to
treat
that
there's
no
--
there
was
no
murder
in
this
case
do
we
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
spritzer,
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
you
gave
us
some
figures
before
lunch,
several
thousand
cases
that
--
that
you've
had.
do
you
know
how
many
among
those
were
cases
of
felony
murder
such
as
this
where
the
--
of
necessity,
all
of
the
defendants
were
given
the
same
punishment
and
were
later
the
maximum
--
the
maximum
crime
was
found
not
to
have
been
proven
and
the
included
offense
--
not
included
offense,
but
the
offense,
that
lesser
offense
was
sustained?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
there
any
you
know?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
--
you
don't
know
of
any?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
spritzer,
do
you
--
do
you
conceive
that
there's
any
difference
at
all
between
the
cases
where
--
like
this
where
a
man
is
convicted
of
felony
murder
and
there
is
no
discretion
in
the
court-martial?
it
must
all
get
death
or
life
imprisonment
and
then
there
are
lesser
offenses
in
which
they're
also
convicted
on
the
one
--
that's
on
the
one
hand.
on
the
other
hand,
take
a
crime
like
desertion
in
various
other
crimes
that
were
also
charged
against
him.
the
--
the
court
has
a
latitude
on
each
one
of
those
even
the
--
even
the
major
crime
as
to
the
punishment.
do
you
conceive
any
difference
between
those
cases
when
it
comes
to
--
to
determining
the
powers
of
review
board
after
the
major
crime
has
been
--
been
found
not
to
have
been
committed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
my
point
--
my
point
is
this.
that
on
--
on
the
desertion
charge
and
--
and
the
other
lesser
offenses
included
there,
the
--
the
court-martial
and
the
reviewing
authorities
at
least
have
the
--
the
right
to
say
that
all
things
considered,
one
defendant
should
have
10
years,
another,
seven
years,
and
another
five
years.
and
then,
if
it
--
if
the
major
crime
was
knocked
out,
there
would
be
some
measurement
at
least.
but
--
but
when
the
court-martial
must,
of
necessity,
give
them
all
the
same
sentence,
namely,
life
imprisonment
on
the
murder
charge
and
then
when
the
murder
charge
is
knocked
out,
have
nothing
--
nothing
at
all
to
be
guided
by
so
far
as
he
picked
to
the
court-martial
he's
concerned
on
lesser
offenses,
it
seems
to
me,
that's
a
different
situation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
by
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
by
not
legal
--
by
not
legal,
you
mean
not
exceeding
the
punishment
for
that
crime
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
one
can
presume
also
that
the
court-martial
knows
these
advisory
powers
of
the
reviewing
board.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
hence,
if
the
conviction
for
murder
is
set
aside,
it
has
power.
you're
contending
to
impose
such
part
of
that
sentence
which
is
necessarily
included
in
20
years
in
the
remaining
offense.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
spritzer,
may
--
is
this
an
apparent
question
to
ask?
to
what
extent
would
--
would
in
your
opinion
be
the
detriment
to
military
justice
if
--
if
the
rule
asked
for
by
these
appellants
would
prevail?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
mr.
susteren.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
see
how
you
--
