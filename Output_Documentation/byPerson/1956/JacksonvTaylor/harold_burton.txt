justice
harold
burton
then
the
entire
issue
between
you
is
whether
or
not
the
board
of
review
or
a
new
court-martial
could
reset
this
sentence.
justice
harold
burton
that
board
of
review
finding
is
in
no
event
final
even
when
they
make
under
those
conditions,
as
i
understand
it,
will
go
to
the
judge
advocate
and
then
goes
to
the
court
for
a
review.
justice
harold
burton
mr.
spritzer.
justice
harold
burton
what
happens
to
that
light
of
the
accused,
when,
as
here,
the
board
of
review
adjusts
as
you
say
the
sentence,
does
that
deprive
the
soldier
of
his
opportunity
to
appeal
to
the
convening
authority
for
clemency
or
reduction?
justice
harold
burton
could
you
give
us
the
reference.
