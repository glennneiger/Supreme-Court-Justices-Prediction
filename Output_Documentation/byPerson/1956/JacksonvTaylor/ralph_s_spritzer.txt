mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
i
should
address
myself
that
the
outset
to
the
single
sentence
or
gross
sentence
practice,
which
has
existed
in
military
law
from
the
very
beginning
because
it
is
that
which
has
provided
the
foundation
for
the
controversy
that
is
written
here.
no
matter
the
number
of
chargers
or
specifications
of
which
an
accused
is
charged,
the
court-martial
in
all
cases
imposes
a
single
sentence.
chief
justice
fuller
of
this
court
spoke
of
this
practice
more
than
50
years
ago
in
one
of
the
leading
decisions
of
this
court
relating
to
a
court
martial
jurisdiction,
carter
versus
mcclaughry.
and
there,
said,
“we
understand
the
rule
established
by
military
usage
to
be,
that
the
sentenced
of
a
court-martial
shall
be
in
every
case
an
entirety.”
the
court
of
military
appeals
much
more
recently
of
course
is
dealt
with
this
same
matter
and
frequently
so,
and
it
has
stated
–
i'm
quoting
from
one
of
its
recent
opinions,
“the
concurrent
sentence
is
entirely
without
president
in
military
procedure.
a
single
inclusive
sentence
is
imposed
regardless
of
the
number
or
character
of
the
offenses
of
which
the
accused
has
been
convicted.”
i
think
i
would
also
like
to
mention
to
the
court
at
the
outset
that
the
situation
where
an
accused
is
convicted
of
several
offenses
and
the
reviewing
authorities
either
modify
or
set
aside
one
or
more
of
the
findings
of
guilt
is
obviously
a
very
common
one.
i
supposed
more
charge
sheets
setting
out
the
charges
contain
a
number
of
offenses,
but
then,
contain
a
single
charge.
we
have
some
data
as
to
this.
between
1951,
for
example
when
the
uniform
code
went
into
a
fact,
and
1955,
a
four-year
span,
boards
of
review
which
as
your
honors
referred
operate
at
the
second
stage
of
review
in
a
military
system,
have
modified
findings
in
2861
cases.
there
was
a
modification
by
the
court
of
military
appeals
during
that
same
period
in
an
additional
357
cases.
these
figures
which
run
for
more
than
3000
do
not
include
the
cases
as
to
which
we
have
no
data
available,
in
which
those
modification
of
findings
or
striking
of
some
findings
by
the
convening
authority
at
the
first
stage
of
review.
i
point
this
out
because
the
consequence
of
certain
of
the
arguments
which
have
been
made
by
petitioners
here
today
would
be
that
every
time
in
these
thousands
of
cases
in
which
there
is
a
modification
of
some
of
the
findings,
the
case
would
have
to
go
back
on
the
theories
which
they
advanced
to
the
court-martial.
therefore,
the
contentions,
which
they
make
go
i
think
to
the
very
essence
of
the
structure
of
the
system
of
review
as
it
exists
in
the
military
law
system.
now,
in
our
view,
reviewing
authorities
possess
and
have
traditionally
possessed
substantial
sentencing
powers.
the
court-martial
is
not
the
same,
as
a
district
court
in
the
federal
system.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
these
figures
do
not
have
any
breakdown
and
they
would
include
cases
in
which
the
findings
no
longer
supported
the
sentence
initially
imposed.
it
would
include
also
cases
in
which
the
sentence
might
still
be
legal
but
the
reviewing
authorities
might
feel
in
the
light
of
the
production
of
the
number
of
the
offenses
that
there
should
be
an
adjustment
of
the
sense.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
take
that
the
contention
here
would
go
so
far
as
to
say,
that
you're
entitled
in
every
case
where
there
has
been
a
modification
of
finding
to
have
it
divided
to
the
court.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
but
the
logic
of
that
i
think
would
occur
as
that.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
they
need
not
go
beyond
their
own
case
certainly,
but
i
--
i
think
the
--
the
logic
of
their
argument
is
that
since
you
have
a
gross
sentence
practice
in
the
military,
you
can't
predict
--
predict
is
a
wrong
word.
you
can't
go
back
and
surmise
if
there's
a
modification
on
review.
what
the
court-martial
might
have
done,
had
it
known
at
the
time
it
acted
what
findings
would
ultimately
be
approved.
now,
the
logic
of
that
would
call
for
a
resentencing
as
well,
i
take
it,
in
the
situation
where
the
sentence
might
still
be
a
legal
one
but
might
rest
upon
a
lesser
number
of
convictions.
one
still
couldn't
tell
how
the
court-martial
had
it
known
in
advanced
what
it
didn't
know
might
reacted
to
that
altered
circumstance.
and
the
point
that
we
would
make
is
that
we
think
substantial
sentence
powers,
powers
over
this
sentence
of
a
kind
having
no
counterpart
in
the
civilian
system
have
additionally
been
exercised
by
reviewing
authorities.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes
you
--
you
have
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
the
--
the
history
will
show
and
i
do
intend
to
reach
it.
that
reviewing
authorities
of
one
kind
or
another
have
always
had
broad
powers
over
the
entire
case,
including
powers
to
determine
sentence's
appropriateness.
now,
i
hesitate
to
give
a
short
answer
to
your
honor's
question
about
the
history
at
this
point,
because
as
your
honor
knows,
the
military
system
has
been
refashioned
in
very
many
details,
both
the
1920
after
the
first
world
war
experience,
again,
in
1948
when
there
were
substantial
amendments
to
the
articles
of
war
and
more
recently
of
course
with
the
adaption
of
the
uniform
code
which
became
effective
in
1951.
and
i
cannot
give
a
very
brief
answer
to
the
question
until
i
have
first
indicated
the
structure
of
the
system
as
it
has
existed
at
these
various
stages
and
i
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
hope
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
to
do
that.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
think
the
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
the
articles
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
have
a
great
deal
of
weight
without
even
referring
to
the
--
to
the
history,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
and
it
is
because
of
the
fact
that
this
case
turned
so
largely
upon
an
understanding
of
what
the
military
system
divides
by
congress
is
that
we've
taken
a
rather
unusual
step
of
submitting
to
the
court
several
charts,
which
seek
to
set
out
in
more
or
less
graphic
form
what
is
rather
complicated.
if
i
may
refer
to
that
chart
for
purposes
of
developing
this
point,
chart
one
to
which
i
will
refer
firstly
primarily.
is
the
appellate
process
is
for
this
case
under
the
uniform
code?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
we
have
filled
a
set
of
charts
with
the
clerk,
which
were
to
have
been
distributed
to
the
court.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
now,
at
the
top
of
this
chart
one,
one
finds
the
court-martial.
and
as
your
honors
have
already
heard
in
this
case,
it
found
guilty
to
premeditated
murder
and
attempted
rape,
and
it
judged
life
imprisonment
which
was
the
minimum
sentence
on
the
findings
which
it
had
returned.
now,
the
court-martial
of
course
is
convened
by
the
officer
exercising
court-martial
jurisdiction,
in
this
case,
the
commanding
general
of
an
infantry
division.
now,
after
the
court-martial
concludes,
the
entire
record
goes
to
the
convening
authority
and
that's
the
next
step
in
the
chart,
and
i
--
i
might
parenthetically,
that
every
review
which
is
represented
on
this
page,
down
to
the
court
of
military
appeals,
not
including
that,
but
every
prior
review,
is
a
mandatory
review
with
the
court
of
military
appeals
at
the
final
stage
having
discretion.
now,
the
case
goes
from
a
court-martial
to
the
convening
authority
who
has
attached
to
his
command
a
staff
judge
advocate
whose
advice
he
receives
on
the
case.
now,
the
convening
authority
has
broad
powers,
both
as
to
findings
and
as
to
sentence.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
sentence
of
the
court-martial
and
the
findings
of
the
court-martial
are
of
no
effect
until
the
convening
authority
takes
action
in
relation
to
them.
so,
he
has
powers
which
are
in
many
respect,
powers
like
a
trial
judge
has,
their
judging
powers.
the
court-martial
has
no
trial
judge.
it
is
essentially
a
--
a
lay
body
functioning
as
a
jury
with
power
to
fix
a
sentence
in
addition
to
findings.
now,
the
convening
authority
as
the
court
will
note
from
this
chart
considers
the
facts,
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses
and
the
legal
sufficiency
of
the
record
to
support
convictions.
he
has,
under
the
uniform
code,
they
know
all
of
the
fact-finding
powers.
now,
going
on
as
we
note
on
the
chart,
he
may
approve
the
guilt
of
the
offense,
which
the
court-martial
has
found
or
he
may
disapprove
it,
or
he
may
find
guilt
of
a
lesser
included
offense.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
didn't
catch
your
honors
question.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
oral
reviewing
authorities
are
limited
in
two
respects.
no
matter
the
action,
which
they
take,
they
may
not
increase
the
in-gross
sentence
as
originally
imposed
by
the
court-martial.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
always
--
no,
since
1916
at
least.
i
cannot
go
back
further
than
that.
certainly,
since
world
war
i,
the
--
the
reviewing
authority
has
not
had
any
power
to
increase
sentence.
he
could,
prior
to
that
time,
send
it
back
and
ask
the
court-martial
if
it
wanted
to
increase
it
i
believe,
but
certainly
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
pardon?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
don't
think
he
could
order
it,
even
before
1916,
but
he
could
send
it
back
with
whatever
implication
that
may
have
had.
but
since
1916,
at
least
he
has
had
no
power
to
increase
the
gross
sentence
to
judge
by
the
court.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
he
cannot
send
it
back
for
further
findings
or
for
further
sentencing.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
think
that
it
can
be
felt
out
of
the
uniform
code,
i
--
unless
your
honor
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
wishes
i
will
not
cause
to
do
it
now.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
under
the
uniform
code
and
even
under
the
1920
or
1948
practice,
it
could
not
be
sent
back,
one,
on
an
issue
as
to
which
they
had
been
a
finding
of
not
guilty
and
it
could
not
be
sent
back
for
any
increase
in
sentence.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
prior
to
1916
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
it
could
go
back
to
the
court-martial
under
the
prior
fact.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
that
stopped
in
1916.
that
was
the
last
to
that.
now,
the
second
limitation
i
was
about
to
state
as
to
the
power
of
the
reviewing
authorities
in
relation
to
sentencing
is
of
course
that
no
sentence
ultimately
approved
by
the
reviewing
authority
can
be
in
excess
of
the
legal
limits
for
the
offense
or
offenses,
ultimately
sustained,
on
the
review.
now,
returning
to
the
powers
of
the
convening
authority,
he
may
approve
any
sentence,
which
is
legal,
does
not
exceed
that
adjudged
by
the
court-martial
in
which
he
deems
appropriate
for
the
approved
findings.
he
may
also
do
certain
things
and
this
is
also
highly
significant,
which
the
court-martial
itself
could
not
do.
he
may
suspend
sentence.
he
is
not
bound
by
the
mandatory
minimum
for
a
premeditated
murder
which
is
binding
on
the
court-martial.
in
other
words,
he
has
a
broad
power
including
fact
finding
powers
over
the
entire
case,
with
a
power
as
well
to
determine
a
specially
suited
sentence.
i
shall
--
would
like
to
make
reference
to
the
article
--
article
64
itself,
which
relates
to
the
convening
authority
who
is
of
course
the
first
of
the
three
reviewing
authorities
in
the
military
law
system.
now,
article
64
states,
“in
acting
on
the
findings
and
sentence
of
a
court-martial
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
this
is
in
our
brief
under
the
--
in
the
statute
section
--
i'm
sorry,
64
is
not
--
has
not
been
printed,
66
which
relates
to
the
convening
of
--
to
the
board
of
review
has
been.
and
i'd
like
to
mention
64
first
because
the
convening
authority
in
the
board
of
review
had
analogous
powers.
it's
only
one
sentence
if
they
may
take
the
time
to
read
it,
“in
acting
on
the
findings
and
sentence
to
the
court-martial,
the
convening
authority
shall
approve
only
such
findings
of
guilty,
and
the
sentence
or
such
part
or
amount
of
the
sentence
as
he
finds
correct
in
law
and
fact
and
as
he
in
his
discretion
determine
should
be
approved.
and
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that
this
is
a
scheme,
which
gives
the
convening
authority
the
power
to
modify
and
to
exercise
discretion
as
to
what
type
of
sentence
he
shall
approve.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
he
may
modify
either
findings
or
sentence
in
favor
of
the
accused.
he
cannot
add
to
a
finding
of
not
guilty,
he
cannot
change
that
and
he
cannot
increase
a
sentence
beyond
the
gross
sentence
which
has
been
imposed
by
the
court.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
is
right
and
that
--
that
is
a
power
beyond
into
increase.
professor
morgan
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
catch
any
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
yes.
he
may
give
him
a
confinement
without
hard
labor
or
reduce
it
to
some
lesser
type
of
penalty
altogether.
professor
morgan,
as
the
court
knows,
was
the
architect
to
the
uniform
code.
he
commented
on
article
64,
which
i
have
just
read
to
the
court
in
his
way.
he
said,
“there
is
an
initial
review
by
the
convening
authority
covering
the
law,
facts,
credibility
of
witnesses
and
a
review
of
the
sentence.”
i
turn
now
to
the
second
stage
of
review
and
to
article
66.
as
the
court
will
again,
note
on
this
chart
after
convening
authority
has
acted,
the
case
goes
forward
to
the
judge
advocate
general.
that
review
is
mandatory
in
any
serious
case,
any
case
with
a
punitive
discharge
or
a
serious
penalty,
and
of
course,
was
mandatory
in
this
case.
the
judge
advocate
general
thereupon
refers
the
case
to
the
board
of
review,
which
is
a
board
consisting
of
three
lawyers,
either
military
or
civilian
constituted
in
the
office
of
the
judge
advocate
general.
that
board
operates
as
the
reviewing
court
would
be.
it
receives
briefs
and
hears
arguments
of
counsel.
but
its
powers
again
go
far
beyond
the
powers
of
an
appellate
tribunal
in
the
ordinary
civil
system.
it
is
intended
that
the
board
of
review
should
exercise
powers
de
novo
over
the
findings
and
the
sentence.
it
is
specifically
given
the
power
to
find
the
facts
for
itself
on
the
entire
record.
it
determines
credibility
of
witness.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no
reviewing
authority
can
find
the
fact
of
guilt
and
the
board
of
review
considers
only
the
findings
of
guilt
and
the
sentence
as
approved
by
the
convening
authority.
that
is
the
outer
limit
of
its
power.
it
can
ameliorate
further,
but
no
reviewing
of
authority
can
increase
the
original
sentence
in
gross.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
it's
in
the
articles
of
war
and
in
the
uniform
code.
it
can
be
spelled
out
of
those
like
that.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
this
is
statutory.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
right.
this
is
all
statutory,
your
honor.
the
board
of
review,
like
the
convening
authority,
is
not
bound
by
the
mandatory
minimum,
which
is
binding
on
the
court-martial.
and
as
i
say,
it
may
impose
any
sentence
within
the
limits
already
imposed
by
the
court-martial
which
it
deems
appropriate
for
the
offenses
ultimately
sustained,
and
that
power,
we
find
in
the
articles
66.
the
key
sentence
of
the
article
66
is
that
the
board
of
review
shall
affirm
only
such
findings
of
guilty,
and
the
sentence
or
such
part
or
amount
of
the
sentence
as
it
finds
correct
in
law
and
fact
and
determines
on
the
basis
of
the
entire
record
should
be
approved.
it
has
a
comprehensive
power
to
review
all
of
the
facts
de
novo.
now,
again,
i'd
like
to
refer
to
professor
morgan's
statements
to
the
committee
which
adopted
the
uniform
code
and
that
certainly
is
the
most
persuasive
kind
of
legislative
history
if
there
be
any
doubt
of
the
breadth
of
power
that
congress
intended
to
confer
upon
boards
of
review.
he
said
that
the
board
of
review
now
has
very
expensive
powers.
it
may
review
law,
facts,
and
practically
sentences,
because
the
provisions
stipulate
that
the
board
of
review
shall
affirm
only
so
much
of
the
sentence
as
it
finds
to
be
justified
by
the
whole
record.
it
gives
the
board
of
review
the
power
to
review
facts,
law,
and
sentence,
and
to
judge
the
credibility
of
witnesses
and
to
make
new
findings
insofar
as
they
may
be
in
favor
of
the
accused.
now,
when
the
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
i
think,
not
your
honor
because
“affirm”
is
a
word
of
organ
in
--
in
military
law
and
the
action
of
the
board
of
review
is
known
as
affirming
action.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it's
called
a
--
it's
called
affirming
action,
and
it
means
action
on
the
sentence.
it
does
not
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
but
does
know
what
the
sentences
is
and
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
he
knows
the
engross
sentence.
that's
all
it
can
ever
know,
because
there
never
is
a
military
sentence,
which
is
so
much
for
each
of
multiple
offenses,
your
honor.
the
engross
practice
has
been
unbearing.
and
if
the
power
of
the
reviewing
authority
to
alter
sentence
in
the
light
of
altered
findings,
could
not
be
exercised,
then
literarily,
thousands
of
cases
in
which
there
has
been
modification,
we'll
have
to
go
back
to
new
courts.
because
time
and
time
again,
that's
not
only
the
case
of
striking
out
an
offense.
it's
quite
common
for
an
--
an
accused
to
be
charged
with
a
more
serious
offense,
and
then
to
be
--
to
have
that
reduced
on
review
to
a
lesser-included
offense.
there
are
hundreds
of
desertion
cases
in
which
the
reviewing
authorities
have
said,
“we're
only
going
to
approve
so
much
of
this
as
amounts
to
a
finding
of
guilty
of
absence
without
leave,
rather
than
dissertation.”
the
reviewing
authorities
and
particularly,
the
board
of
review
had
been
created
and
encouraged
to
be
an
ameliorating
influence
within
the
court
martial
system,
to
give
an
independent
review
removed
from
the
trial
thing.
they're
encouraged
too,
when
they
feel
that
there
is
reasonable
doubt
to
reexamine
the
facts
and
to
cut
down,
either,
to
a
lesser-included
offense
or
to
strike
it
out.
now,
these
petitioners
are
suggesting
that
the
counterpart
of
that
is
that
every
time
the
reviewing
authority
makes
a
modification
of
the
sentence
that
the
case
will
have
to
go
back
for
resentencing
to
a
court-martial,
which
in
the
nature
of
things,
no
longer
exists.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
should
take
that
logical.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
a
question
was
asked
earlier
in
the
argument
as
to
the
specific
provision,
which
would
prevent
any
increase
of
penalty
by
any
of
the
reviewing
authorities.
i
stated
that
the
articles
made
that
clear.
i
would
like
to
refer
the
court
now
to
the
specific
provision
that
i
had
in
my
mind,
but
did
not
at
that
point
cite.
article
62
declares
--
i'm
dealing
generally
with
reconsideration
and
revision
by
the
court-martial
and
the
power
of
the
convening
authority
to
send
it
back
to
the
court.
in
no
case,
however,
may
the
record
be
returned,
one,
for
reconsideration
of
a
finding
of
not
guilty
of
any
specification
or
a
ruling,
which
amounts
to
a
finding
of
not
guilty.
and
then,
under
three,
for
increasing
the
severity
of
the
sentence,
unless
the
sentence
proscribed
for
the
offense
is
mandatory.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
quite
correct.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
oh,
yes.
the
board
of
review
found
those
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
room
for
a
reasonable
doubt
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
and
it
set
that
aside
and
that
action
is
final.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
now,
getting
back
to
your
honor's
questions
in
--
in
sequences,
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
record,
and
there
cannot,
in
the
nature
of
things
under
a
gross
sentence
practice
to
indicate
what
sentence
the
court-martial
might
have
adjudged
if
it
found
to
be
accused
guilty
only
of
one
offense
to
wit
the
attempted
rape
charged.
and
i
think
the
question
comes
squarely
down
to
this.
what
did
congress
proposed
in
respect
to
allocation
of
sentence
powers?
we
believe
that
congress
certainly
recognize
the
gross
sentence
practice.
it
dissolves
as
military
law
and
the
man
who,
for
court-martial
indeed,
tells
the
court
that
it
must
return
a
single
sentence,
covering
all
of
the
offenses.
now,
with
that
background
of
this
gross
or
general
sentence
practice,
the
question
is
what
did
congress
proposed
should
happen
if
as
would
quite
commonly
occur
and
has,
one
or
more
of
the
multiple
convictions
was
modified
or
set
aside
on
review?
and
we
say
that
in
that
situation,
the
articles
contemplate
and
practical
considerations,
which
where
in
the
minds
of
congress
strongly
support
the
necessity
that
the
power
to
fix
a
specially
suited
sentence
for
the
convictions
as
approved
be
in
reviewing
authorities.
now,
i
think
there
is
no
question
that
in
the
military
law
system,
congress
could
decide
that
the
court
martial
power
shouldn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
sentence
at
all.
it
could
say,
“their
function
will
be
specifically
finding
guilt.”
certainly,
it's
no
novelty
and
in
our
jurisprudence
to
have
a
separation
of
the
facts
finding
and
the
sentencing
functions.
now,
in
the
court
martial
system,
there
is
not
a
complete
separation.
the
court-martial,
which
acts
like
the
jury
in
determining
the
facts,
also
fixes
an
initial
sentence,
which
represents
for
all
time
thereafter,
the
maximum
sentence.
but
we
say
that
it
is
contemplated
that
the
reviewing
authorities,
in
studying
the
record
and
in
making
modifications
for
the
accused
benefit,
shall
also
have
the
power
when
they
make
such
modifications
for
his
benefit
to
make
an
adjustment
of
the
sentence.
quite
normally,
certainly,
the
sentence
is
imposed
by
the
courts-martial
in
which
are
constituted
quite
generally
of
line
officers
are
much
more
severe
than
the
sentences
as
ultimately
approved
by
the
reviewing
authorities,
particularly,
as
approve
by
the
board
of
review.
now,
i'd
say
since
congress
could've
taken
all
sentencing
power
away
from
the
court-martial,
that
there
is
no
inequity
in
establishing
a
system
where
when
there
are
modifications
of
the
findings,
the
reviewing
authorities
will
adjust
the
sentence.
i
say
there's
no
inequity
because
the
reviewing
authority
has
limits,
in
no
event,
cannot
exceed
the
legal
limit
for
the
offense
ultimately
approved.
in
no
event,
cannot
exceed
the
engross
sentence
imposed
by
the
court.moreover,
the
board
of
review
is
directed
to
review
the
entire
record.
it
can
find
the
facts
anew,
and
it
is
--
and
as
an
expert
body,
it
is
in
a
position
to
impose
a
fair
sentence.
and
that
brings
me
to
what
the
senate
committee
stated
in
its
report
when
it
recommended
that
the
board
of
review
begin
in
this
board
powers
over
findings
and
sentence
alike.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
the
--
the
judge
advocate
--
the
case
goes
back
in
the
board
of
review
to
the
judge
advocate
as
we
indicate
and
he
has
certain
powers.
he
may
suspend
the
sentence
as
ultimately
approved.
he
also
notifies
the
accused
of
his
right
to
appeal
to
the
board
of
review.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
--
when
i
say
final
so
far
as
the
top
limit
is
concerned,
i
mean
that
the
engross
sentence
of
the
court
cannot
be
increased.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
as
to
the
top
limit
of
the
sentence
for
all
of
the
convictions,
which
the
court-martial
returns
that
the
court-martial
is
instructed
that
it
may
not
return
individual
punishments
for
the
individual
offenses.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
hence,
the
top
limit
must
be
taken
to
mean,
the
limit
for
all
of
the
findings
of
guilt.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
but
this
is
a
--
a
--
an
unusual
case,
no
by
no
means
the
only
one
right.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
--
i
can
agree
with
that,
by
adding
to
that,
but
it
always
seems
for
all
of
the
offenses,
because
there's
no
power
to
apportion
in
the
court-martial.
and
you
quite
commonly,
your
honor,
will
have
this
situation.
an
accused
will
be
charged,
let
us
say,
with
a
--
with
deserting
and
then
with
passing
some
bad
checks
and
he'll
get
a
gross
sentence
of
10
years
from
the
court.
now,
the
board
of
review
may
say,
"we're
not
to
satisfy
the
element
of
intent
to
stay
away
permanently.
it's
sufficiently
proved.
therefore,
we're
going
to
cut
the
desertion
down
to
absence
without
leave.”
now,
let's
assume
that
the
penalty
of
10
years
is
now
excessive
for
absence
without
leave,
plus
passing
a
bad
check.
now,
nobody
can't
say
just
what
penalty
the
court-martial
might
have
impose
for
the
offense
of
that
absence
without
leave,
had
it
known
that
its
findings
of
the
desertion
wouldn't
be
sustained.
but
that
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
occurs
in
numerous
variations.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
right.
the
maximum
is
all
of
it,
by
definition.
it
couldn't
be.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i
don't
know
and
i
would
assume
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
will
assume
that
would
be
a
rare
situation.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
don't
know.
i
don't
have
any
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
breakdown,
your
honor,
as
to
these
figures.
there
is
simply
overall
figures
as
to
the
cases
in
which
findings
of
guilt
have
been
modified.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
now,
i
--
the
point
i'm
making
on
the
basis
of
those
figures
is
that
it
seems
to
me
that
you
must
say
that
in
every
case
where
there's
a
modification
of
any
finding
that
you
don't
know
precisely
what
the
court
would
have
done
had
it
known
that
this
modification
was
subsequently
going
to
take
place.
you
can't
know
in
the
military
system
because
of
the
engross
sentence
and
practice.
you
would
know
if
there
were
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
well,
i
was
just
going
to
say
you
would
know
if
there
were
practices
of
punishing
for
each
count
for
each
offense.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it's
necessarily
included.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
certainly.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
the
--
the
problem
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
i'm
talking
about
is
the
sentencing
problem.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
--
i
don't
find
from
my
part
any
material
distinction
in
the
lesser
included
offense
case,
because
the
board
of
review
in
such
a
case
can
only
find
guilt
of
the
absence
without
leave
because
it's
an
element
of
the
court-martial's
finding.
it
couldn't
make
a
finding
which
wasn't
necessarily
included
in
the
court-martial's
finding.
so,
you
have
a
case
there
too
in
which
i
can't
say
and
nobody
can
say
in
that
hypothetical
case.
now,
what
would
the
court-martial
have
done
had
it
thought
that
he
was
guilty
only
on
awol
and
not
desertion?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
but
our
problem
in
--
in
relation
to
sentencing
i
think
is,
do
you
have
to
determine
what
the
court-martial
might
have
done,
had
it
known
then
what
alterations
in
the
findings
were
going
to
be
made
later?
and
i
say
you
don't
have
to
determine
that,
because
if
our
view
of
this
system
provided
by
congress
is
correct,
it
is
contemplated
that
reviewing
authorities
shall
have
power
over
sentence
adequate
to
deal
with
that
situation.
now,
that
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
is
a
crucial
question.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
--
i
cannot
--
i
don't
have
figures
to
say
percentage
wise.
i
can
say
without
hesitation
that
the
modification
of
findings
is
very
frequent
as
these
figures
that
i've
given
your
honor
a
test.i
think
more
than
2800
cases
in
four
years
is
the
great
many
indeed
when
one
considers
further
that
only
the
serious
case
can
come
to
the
board
of
review.
so,
i
would
say
there
is
a
very
strong
tendency
on
the
part
of
boards
of
review
to
exercise
great
initiative
in
sifting
the
legal
sufficiency
of
the
charges.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
the
problem,
which
would
face
the
board
of
review,
if
it
had
to
determine
what
the
court-martial
might
have
done
is
precisely
the
thing,
your
honor.
because
in
the
case
i
opposed
where
you
have
a
10-year
sentence
for
desertion
and
passing
a
bad
check
and
having
an
engross
sentence
and
the
board
of
review
sets
aside
the
desertion,
it
can't
tell
how
much
the
court-martial
would
have
apportioned
for
the
bad
check
account,
it's
in
the
same
possession.
if
it
sets
aside
the
--
the
desertion,
it
has
--
it
--
it
can't
tell
how
the
court-martial
would
have
allocated
what
remains.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
don't
think,
on
the
basis
of
the
articles,
you
could
draw
a
distinction
and
say
that
there
is
power
in
the
reviewing
authorities
to
modify
sentence
in
the
case
of
--
in
the
light
of
altered
finding,
except
where
it's
a
felony
murder
situation.
now,
that
--
it
may
be
true
that
in
that
situation
where
there's
a
mandatory
sentence,
the
board
of
review
will
have
less
guidance
in
the
nature
of
things
than
it
might
have
as
it
were
a
case
not
involving
a
mandatory
penalty.
but
our
answer
to
that
is
that
we
think
the
board
of
review
has
the
power
and
was
given
the
job
by
congress
of
considering
all
the
facts
in
the
record
for
itself
in
determining
especially
suited
sentence
in
a
circumstance
like
this,
in
any
of
these
situations
where
there
is
modification.
i'd
like
to
read
to
the
court
what
i
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
have
not
forgotten.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
is
right.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
is
right.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
and
that
rests
upon
our
analysis
of
the
uniform
code
and
of
the
specific
articles
which
i've
mentioned.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
mean
that
and
i
would
have
to
add
the
further
qualification
but
not
exceeding
the
original
sentence
engross
in
those
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
other
questions.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
is
right.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
now
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
i
would
like
to
get
before
the
court
one
sentence
from
the
report
of
the
senate
committee
in
relation
to
article
66,
which
is
the
article,
which
gives
the
board
of
review
its
powers.
and
the
senate
committee
stated,
“the
board
may
set
aside
on
the
basis
of
the
record
any
part
of
a
sentence,
either
because
it
is
illegal
or
because
it
is
inappropriate."
i
emphasize
that
word
“inappropriate”.
“it
is
contemplated,”
the
report
states,
“that
this
power
will
be
exercised
to
establish
uniformity
of
sentences
throughout
the
arm
forces.”
now,
i'd
say
it's
apparent
from
that
congress
knew
that
it
was
giving
the
boards
of
review
extensive
judging
powers
to
arrive
at
the
sentences,
which
were
specially
suited
to
the
offense
or
offenses
as
ultimately
sustained
by
the
board
of
review.
now,
what
is
the
alternative,
which
will
flow
from
petitioner's
suggestion,
that
where
there
are
altered
findings,
you
have
to
go
back
to
court-martial?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
we
have
also
quoted
in
our
brief
and
i
did
a
little
to
that
briefly
before
what
professor
morgan
had
said
to
the
committee.
there's
also
a
history,
which
shows
that
the
judge
advocate
general
of
the
respective
services
did
not
want
the
boards
of
review
to
have
power
over
sentencing.
they
apparently
preferred
that
such
power
be
placed
in
the
judge
advocate
general
rather
than
in
boards.
we've
given
some
of
the
colloquy,
both
in
the
senate
and
the
house,
which
shows
that
both
the
senate
and
the
house
concluded
that
they
wanted
the
boards
of
review
to
have
the
power
over
sentences.
and
then,
there
is
in
the
report,
this
language
i
have
just
mentioned
that
--
that
one
of
the
things
they
hope
for
is
that
the
boards
of
review
will
achieve
certain
degree
of
uniformity
and
appropriateness
of
sentence.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
no.
no,
i
don't
--
it's
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
not
the
kind
of
situation
one
would
readily
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
envision
and
we've
--
i
think
we've
given
everything
in
our
--
our
brief
that
we
know
of
that
is
relevant
to
this
history.
it
is
a
fairly
full
brief.
what
we
think
emerges
then
from
this
structure
of
review
there
--
are
these
facts.
in
the
first
place,
we
think
that
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
court-martial
is
essentially
like
a
jury,
which
is
convened
for
a
limited
time.
it
can
be
convened
only
for
a
single
case,
which
has
no
continuity,
no
situs.
by
the
time
this
very
case
was
reviewed
by
the
board
of
reviews
on
six
or
seven
months
after
the
case
had
been
tried,
it's
quite
probable
that
you
couldn't
get
a
form
of
the
same
court,
especially
in
the
field
would
that
be
true.
and
i
--
i
think
i
say
that
it's
quite
uncommon
that
a
court-martial
would
function
as
the
unit
for
more
than
a
few
weeks
or
--
or
perhaps,
a
few
short
months,
because
officers
are
constantly
being
assigned
in
new
duties
or
to
new
stations.
we
think
further,
it
appears
from
an
analysis
of
the
structure
of
the
military
law
review
system
that
congress
has
here
vested
extensive
judging
powers
in
reviewing
authorities
as
well
as
in
courts-martial.
these
authorities,
both
at
the
convening
authority
level
and
at
the
board
of
review
level
can
review
the
fact
as
de
novo.and
congress
has
specifically
indicated
that
it
has
expected
that
the
boards
of
review
would
make
judgments
as
the
convening
authorities
also
to
do
since
he
is
to
act
on
the
sentence
in
his
discretion,
would
make
judgements
as
to
sentence
appropriateness.
now,
that
indicates
to
us
that
the
reviewing
authorities
are
not
solely
agencies
of
review,
though
we
use
that
term.
they
have
powers,
which
partake
of
the
powers
of
a
trial
judge
in
our
federal
system.
the
--
the
court-martial
has
no
presiding
judge
like
our
district
court
does
and
the
court-martial
is
a
very
transient
body.
but
the
convening
authority
does
have
powers
like
a
judge
and
extensive
ones
for
he
cannot
only
consider
the
facts,
he
can
decide
in
his
discretion
how
much
of
the
court-martial
sentence
to
approve.
and
that,
we
think,
is
the
key
to
the
question,
what
is
to
be
the
disposition
of
a
case
involving
multiple
convictions
in
which
there
are
modifications
of
the
findings
by
the
higher
authorities.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
where
the
board
of
review
acts
on
sentence,
the
convening
authority
may
no
longer
act.
in
the
situation
i'm
referring
to,
the
sentencing,
the
judgment
as
to
appropriateness
of
the
sentence
would
be
made
by
the
board
of
review.
now,
if
the
board
of
review
had
decided
in
this
case
that
perhaps
there
should
be
a
retrial
on
the
murder
count
it
would've
disposed
of
the
case
differently.
it
would
have
said,
“we
are
remanding
the
case
to
the
convening
authority
for
a
hearing
or
such
other
action
as
he
may
deem
appropriate.”
now,
if
in
that
circumstance,
the
convening
authority
decided
that
for
one
reason
or
another,
the
murder
charge
could
not
be
retried.
for
example,
the
unavailability
of
witnesses,
then
it
would
be
in
his
profits
since
the
case
had
been
referred
back
to
him
to
adjust
the
sentence
in
the
light
of
the
findings,
ultimately
sustained.
in
no
event,
do
we
think
that
this
system
contemplates
a
reference
back
to
a
court-martial
for
resentencing?
the
petitioners
have
pointed
out
that
if
the
case
were
to
go
back,
it
would
have
to
go
to
a
new
court.
now,
i
--
i
think
it
would
be
an
astonishing
suggestion
that
congress
intended
a
new
court
to
read
a
called
record
and
fix
inappropriate
sentence.
when
congress
has
created
a
board
of
review,
especially
qualified
professional
body
to
pass
upon
matters
of
sentence
appropriateness
and
has
indeed
said,
“we
hope
that
in
giving
the
boards
of
review
this
power,
greater
uniformity
of
sentences
among
the
various
services
will
be
achieved.”
now,
we're
saying
that
the
court-martial,
once
it
has
expired
is
hardly
the
body
to
commit
this
matter
of
resentencing,
but
this
system
contemplates
that
judging
power
is
vested
in
reviewing
authorities
shall
serve
that
purpose.
now,
that
of
course
has
been
the
unanimous
position
of
the
cases
as
decided
during
the
brief
history
of
the
court
of
military
appeal.
i'm
not
going
to
attempt
to
refer
to
its
decisions
in
the
brief
time
remaining,
but
it
has
dealt.
the
court
of
military
appeals
has
dealt
on
numerous
occasions
with
this
question
of
resentencing,
and
it
has
said
that
the
change
in
the
quantum
of
punishment,
which
is
to
be
made
in
the
lighter
--
light
of
altered
findings
is
to
be
made
by
reviewing
authorities.
there's
only
one
case
and
that
needs
some
--
a
word
of
explanation.
only
one
case
we
know
of
in
which
a
resentencing
matter
was
ever
committed
back
to
a
court-martial
and
that
was
this
situation.
an
officer
had
been
tried
on
five
charges
and
found
guilty
on
five.
the
board
of
review
and
the
court
of
military
appeals
determined
that
certain
of
the
charges
were
not
supported
and
the
end
result
was
that
after
the
court
military
appeals
had
finished,
only
one
offense
of
the
five
stood
intact,
only
one
finding
of
guilt
and
that
a
very
minor
offense.
the
officer
had
been
sentenced
to
dismiss
it.
the
court
of
military
appeals
said
in
that
case
that
it
did
not
think
that
the
reviewing
authority
could
make
any
adjustment,
had
the
power
to
make
any
adjustment
in
the
sentence,
because
a
change
from
dismissal
to
any
other
form
of
punishment
is
deemed
in
military
law
a
commutation
of
sentence.
a
change
to
a
different
type
of
punishment
and
a
commutation
of
sentences
that
power
is
reserved
to
the
president
alone.
and
the
--
and
the
court
of
military
appeals
in
that
case
said
that
it
thought
that
the
officer
should
be
retried
under
one
offense
which
was
found
a
valid
conviction.
other
than
that,
we
know
of
no
instance
of
sending
it
back
to
the
court-martial
for
resentencing.
now,
i
still
could
not
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
pardon
sir?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
was
retried
on
the
merits.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
am
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
i'm
--
i'll
come
to
it
immediately.
we
think
it
must
be
conclusively
presumed
that
the
court-martial
here
imposed
a
gross
sentence,
which
covered
both
the
offenses
of
which
the
accused
had
just
been
found
guilty
by
the
court-martial.
and
for
these
reasons,
the
court-martial
has
a
duty
to
impose
a
proper
sentence
for
all
of
the
offenses
of
which
the
accused
are
found
guilty.
the
court-martial
also
is
required
to
impose
a
single
sentence.
therefore,
i
say,
that
when
the
court-martial,
having
returned
findings
of
guilt
of
two
offenses,
imposes
a
sentence
in
gross.
it
is
too
conclusively
to
be
presumed
as
in
the
case
of
any
general
sentence
that
the
sentence
imposed
covers
all
of
the
offenses
of
which
the
accused
were
found
guilty.
now,
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
more
reason
in
this
case
to
suppose
that
the
sentence
doesn't
cover
all
of
the
offenses,
merely
because
it's
a
mandatory
sentence
of
life
imprisonment.
i
don't
think,
as
judge
hastie
quoted
in
his
opinion
in
number
619
that,
“the
military
is
required
to
adapt
any
such
oddity
as
giving
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
plus
a
term
of
years.”
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
--
i
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
--
i
would
say
that
the
court
has
an
--
the
court-martial
has
an
unqualified
duty
in
all
cases
to
impose
a
proper
sentence
for
all
of
the
offenses
of
which
had
found
be
accused
guilty.
now,
i
--
i
hardly
think
that
that
one
could
say
that,
could
--
could
invoke
any
different
conclusion
because
if
they
happen
to
answer,
there
was
a
mandatory
sentence
here.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
the
convening
authority
in
any
case
in
which
the
court-martial
fails
to
impose
any
sentence
would
return
it
to
the
court-martial
by
proceedings
in
revisions
so
that
it
would
adjudge
its
sentence.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
no
doubt
--
it's
no
doubt
true
that
the
--
that
the
court-martial
wouldn't
have
to
give
the
attention
to
the
rape
penalty
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
that
it
wouldn't
in
other
circumstances.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
but
i
hardly
think
one
can
jump
from
that
rule
of
law,
which
said
that
an
engross
sentence
doesn't
cover
all
offenses
of
which
the
accused
is
found
guilty
where
you
have
a
mandatory
minimum
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes
sir,
that
for
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it's
fully
aware
to
that.
in
fact,
of
course,
it's
fundamental
on
the
system
that
the
court
martial
sentence
has
no
effect
at
all
until
reviewing
authorities
act
upon
it.
now,
in
this
case,
the
reviewing
authorities
were
in
a
position
to
consider
the
entire
record.
the
board
of
review,
when
it
imposed
the
maximum
sentence
for
rape,
didn't
do
it
because
it
believed
that
it
ought
to
have
a
maximum
as
a
matter
of
course.
it
considered
at
length
and
i
would
command
to
the
court,
the
board
of
review's
opinion,
the
circumstances
in
this
case,
which
it
characterized
it's
ruthlessly
vicious
when
it
decided
that
it
was
going
to
impose
a
maximum
penalty.
now,
i
don't
intend
to
go
outside
the
record
into
the
facts
as
shown
by
the
court
martial
record.
this
is
a
thin
record
that
comes
out
on
habeas
corpus.
i
don't
--
i've
heard
for
the
first
time
today
the
suggestion
that
the
woman
who
was
raped
was
a
prostitute.
i
suggest
that
insofar
as
--
it's
necessarily
to
consider
whether
the
board
of
review
exercised
the
discretion
which
is
supposed
to.
i
suggest
that
the
place
turned
for
an
examination
of
that
as
the
board
of
review's
opinion,
which
gives
the
circumstances
of
this
crime
as
shown
by
the
statements
which
the
accused
themselves
name.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i'd
like
to
answer
that
question
if
i
may,
by
referring
to
a
sentence
or
two
from
the
court
of
military
appeals
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
which
is
concerned
about
the
allocation
of
these
powers.
and
it
has
addressed
itself
in
--
on
several
occasions
to
the
question
of
modifying
sentence
in
the
light
of
altered
findings.
now,
it
is
said,
“we
repeat
that
in
military
law
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
i'm
reading
from
page
57
of
the
government's
brief
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
and
this
is
a
recent
decision
of
the
court
of
military
appeals,
united
states
against
(inaudible).
we
repeat
that
in
military
law,
“a
single
inclusive
sentence
is
imposed
and
unless
the
board
of
review
has
the
power
to
affirm
a
sentence
in
whole
or
in
part
when
findings
are
modified,
the
whole
appellate
structure
must
be
redesigned.”
one
of
the
cardinal
principles,
set
out
in
article
66
is
that
a
board
of
review
may
affirm
all
or
part
of
the
findings
and
determine
a
specially
suited
sentence
from
the
entire
record.
that
obviously
means
the
record
as
it
stands
or
as
it
has
been
changed
by
action
on
the
finding.
i
don't
think
that
one
could
conclude
in
this
case
that
the
board
of
review
did
not
have
authority
to
fix
a
specially
suited
sentence
in
the
exercise
of
its
judgment
without
casting
great
doubt
upon
the
powers
of
boards
of
reviews
to
adjust
sentence
in
other
cases
in
which
there
has
been
an
alteration
of
the
findings
in
the
process
of
review.
the
court
of
military
appeals
expresses
itself
as
believing
that
if
such
powers
of
modification
over
sentence
cannot
be
exercised
by
reviewing
authorities
the
whole
appellate
structure
must
be
redesigned.
and
this
of
course
rest
basically
on
the
fact
that
you
don't
have
a
trial
court
in
the
sense
that
we
do
within
our
federal
system
to
consider
matters
of
resentencing.
