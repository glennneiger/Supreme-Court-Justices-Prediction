do
i
understand
your
only
complaint
is
regarding
the
--
the
impropriety
of
the
sentence?
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
rehearing
of
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
proper
sentence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
the
--
the
original
court-martial
would
be
reconvened
for
an
imposition
of
sentence,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
the
board
of
review,
but
if
--
if
you
prevail,
what
would
happen?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
rehearing
of
--
a
rehearing
of
what,
the
merits?
he'd
be
retried
before
the
court-martial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
a
new
court-martial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
would
you
mind
telling
me
what
the
code
provision
is
as
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
--
but
a
--
a
--
a
different
body
of
officers
who
would
accept
the
finding
of
guilt
and
then
determine
them,
have
merely
a
hearing
as
to
what
sentence
should
be
imposed,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
your
contention,
if
you
--
if
you
prevail
here,
what
would
you
be
doing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
to
not
retry
the
determination
of
guilt.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
a
different
body
of
officers
would
assess
the
heinousness
or
the
gravity
of
the
offense
and
then
decide
what
sentence
to
impose,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me.
you
go
ahead.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
epstein,
your
argument
would
--
would
greatly
impress
me
at
least,
but
for
one
fact,
but
for
one
consideration.
it
would
greatly
impress
me
if
should
you
prevail
here
the
duty
of
resentencing
would
have
to
be
exercised
by
the
people
who
heard
the
evidence
and
make
an
assessment
on
the
defendant,
a
kind
of
a
fellow
he
was,
testimony
against
him.
but
as
i
understand
it,
you
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
as
i
understand
it,
the
resentence,
the
retrial
of
the
call
of
the
sentence
they
had
a
description.
the
reconsideration
of
this
sentence
would
be
by
as
different
body
of
men
as
the
man
that
constitutes
the
board
of
review.
and
therefore,
the
chief
consideration
when
there
is
an
improper
or
doubtful
sentence
that
the
persons
who
heard
the
merits
should
impose
the
sentence
because
the
sentence
is
to
be
individualized
and
grow
out
of
that
which
they
heard
on
the
merit
fails
here
and
it
seems
to
me,
substituting
one
group
of
non-participants
in
the
trial
for
another
group.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
when
you
say
failure,
i
do
not
understand
that
there
is
a
constitutional
challenge
to
the
power
of
congress
to
provide
for
--
for
a
resentencing
by
a
different
body
than
is
the
merit.
that
is
correct,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
are
you
urging
that
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
were
the
federal
system
of
justice
to
which
we
refer,
you
would
have
to
have
jury
trial
under
all
the
other
requirements
of
the
--
of
the
bill
of
rights.
but
this
is
a
military
justice
with
all
the
differentiation
in
treatment
that
the
cause
of
the
constitution
very
carefully
accepted
by
saying
it
shouldn't
apply
to
military
trial.
and
therefore,
the
human,
practical,
reasonable
consideration
to
which
you
refer
and
which
i
deeply
share
isn't
constitutionally
applicable
to
this
situation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
while
you're
dealing
with
the
--
with
the
military
differentiation
that
he's
so
controlling
that
if
others
were
aware
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
you
can
--
you
can
send
a
case
back
to
the
same
judge,
because
he's
the
same
judge.
but
practically
speaking,
you
can't
send
him
back
to
the
same
court-martial
so
in
a
particular
case
you
could,
so
they're
scattered
all
over
the
world.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
raised
question
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
say
he
had
none.
i
don't
think
you
have
none,
but
i'm
saying
this
particular
thing.
i
do
not
see.
rightly
enough,
it
isn't
here.
it
wasn't
even
raised
and
before
the
third
circuit,
namely,
that
it
isn't
--
you've
got
a
situation
which
practically
human.
intrinsically,
it's
so
different
than
the
case
of
military
justice
from
the
case
of
civil
justice.
that
it's
impossible
to
send
it
back
to
the
same
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
not
--
that's
not
suggesting
that
the
consideration
that
i
put
to
you
destroyed
your
case.
i'm
suggesting
the
argument
you
make
as
with
her
lacks
a
powerful
appeal
that's
controlled
in
civil
justice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
had
a
hearing
before
the
board
of
review.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
want
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
in
your
complaint?
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
complaint
isn't
that
the
board
of
review
acted
--
acted
arbitrarily.
your
complaint
is
that
they
have
no
power
and
it
must
be
sent
back
here
to
ad
hoc
court-martial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
did
--
was
your
client
debarred
from
arguing
before
the
board
of
review
after
the
murder
charge
was
knocked
out?
were
you
debarred
from
arguing
that
tribunal,
the
board
of
review,
what
sentence
less
than
the
maximum
they
should
impose?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he's
not
been
presented
before
the
board?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
but
is
the
court
--
is
this
--
has
his
cause
under
sentence
a
hearing
before
the
board?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
that
any
of
these
questions
imply
my
--
my
conclusion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
know
what
the
facts
are.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
he'd
be
represented?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
is
a
claim
for
reduction
of
a
sentence
to
be
represented.
if
the
counsel
thinks
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
hearing
is
not
a
hearing
and
abstract
though,
but
you
want
a
hearing
before
a
newly
constituted
court-martial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
particular
--
your
argument
has
usually
dealt
with
this,
as
i
see
it.
you
say
that
in
fact,
the
court-martial
imposed
no
sentence
and
the
board
of
review
has
no
power
to
impose
a
sentence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
spritzer,
may
i
ask
you
to
do
what
i
know
you
will
do
in
a
few
minutes
and
i
don't
mean
to
ask
you
at
this
phase,
to
come
more
directly
to
the
--
to
the
problems
that
it
created
by
the
present
legislative
scheme
regarding
a
reviewing
authority.
and
onto
my
ignorance,
i
ought
to
know
but
don't
is
what
--
when
did
the
situation
that
is
expressed
legislatively
in
(c)
and
(d)
of
article
66.
historically,
how
old
in
the
situation
that
is
--
that
is
formulated
in
those
two
subsections,
sub-articles?
you
say
historically
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
i
want
to
know
more
particularly,
what
--
what
were
the
organs
of
review
by
a
trial
to
the
military
code
on
the
practice,
which
you
can
draw
in
order
to
illuminate
military
code.
did
i
put
my
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
otherwise,
the
--
the
history
is
relevant
only
if
we've
got
a
continuity
of
--
of
more
or
less
continuity
of
--
of
the
procedure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you're
going
to
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because,
you
intend
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
we
will
have
to
come
to
the
very
terms
of
(c)
and
(d)
and
i
suppose
what
your
argument
is
heading
into
is
to
read
into
(c)
and
(d)
a
glass
from
history,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
apart
from
the
specific
--
justice

frankfurter
--
relevance
of
(voice

justice
felix

all
right,
but
you
have
to
--
you
will
have
to
go
to
the
articles
themselves
and
also
find
what
conflict
you
can
from
the
history
which
underlined
those
articles.
justice
felix

would
that
be
a
statement?
justice

they
have
that.
they
have

when
you
get
around
to
it

course

suppose
in
this
case,
the
court-martial,
having
found
the
soldiers
guilty
of
murder
and
rape,
and
impose
the
necessary
sentence
for
murder
has
then
said,
“in
view
of
this
fact,
we
not
call
upon
to

what
sentence
we
would
impose

raise?”
suppose,
they

said

you'd
adjust
yourself

you're

your

i'd
like
to

i'll
say
this.
i've
already
left
one
question
with
you
--
justice

--
and
i'd
like
to
put
another
one,
which
illuminates

justice

as
i

your

which
i
followed

as
i
do
your
argument
to
--
and
i
know
the
interest,
i
know
the
attention
it
produced.
your
position
in
effect
is
that
unless
this
court
can
say
that
the
sentence
of
the
board
of
review
is
not
legal,
it
has
no
power
to
interfere
with
you.
justice

that's
--
that's
what
your
argument
--
that
--
justice

frankfurter
--
what's
your
position
is?
justice

that's
why
that
question
hooks
up

the
question
i
put
to
you

mean

not

mr.
spritzer,
are
you
going
to
leave
here
some
time
forth
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
me
is
the
crucial
question
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
when
you
say
conclusively
presumed,
i
--
he
thought
he
had
knew
that
that
mean
that
some
past,
including
an
evidentiary
term,
a
rule
of
law.
and
i
want
to
know
why
you
should
put
in
terms
of
a
rule
of
law,
what's
the
source
of
that?but
the
reason
for
it
is,
when
you
got
a
situation,
which
as
a
practical,
human,
sensible
interpretation
of
the
circumstances
of
this
case
may
make
that
conclusive
presumption,
not
a
sensible
presumption.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
should
--
why
should
a
court
will
find
a
man
of
guilty
of
murder
for
which
it
must
give
him
life
sentence,
also
be
even
thinking
of
what
it
would
do
for
a
sentence
that
calls
for
a
term
of
years?
why
shouldn't
any
--
what
is
it
that
requires
of
me
to
say
that
that's
the
rule
of
law
except
to
this
extent,
namely,
from
your
point
of
view
that
there's
a
general
--
that
the
control
that
you
have
the
doctrine
--
the
--
the
rule
of
law
that
you
have
a
gross
sentence.
the
rule
of
law
that
the
--
the
board
of
review
is
not
confined
and
the
court
of
appeals
as
in
the
civil
cases
are
saying,
“well,
for
all
we
know,
the
same
judgment,
the
case
they
be
sent
back
would've
impose
the
different
sentences
for
the
reason
that
you
well
indicated.”
but
the
only
rule
of
law,
the
only
reason
why
it
should
include
the
rule
of
law
in
this
situation
to
say
that
the
considerations
of
symmetry
in
the
law
or
harmonious
comprehensiveness
disallow
us
to
look
at
this
case
in
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
you
--
suppose
you
take
the
question
as
i
put
it
to
you.
suppose
they've
actually
said,
“we
don't
have
to
bother
about
the
sentence
for
rape.”
now,
that
is
not
this
case,
i
understand
that.
suppose
that
were
in,
what
would
you
do
with
that
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
really,
would
they
--
they
say,
“why
do
we
have
to
bother
about
this?
these
--
these
are
human
beings
after
all.”
they
say,
“he
isn't
guilty
of
murder
to
sentence
his
life.”
why
bother
to
say,
10
years
extra
for
rape,
running
concurrently
as
it
were.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
interpreting
the
rule
of
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
we
know
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
we
know
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
just
as
to
me,
just
as
rational
to
assume
that
didn't
--
i
now
put
the
reverse
of
my
difficulty
to
that
which
i
put
to
mr.
spritzer,
just
as
--
that's
for
me
to
assume
they
say,
“this
fellow
ought
to
get
life
for
this
retched
did
and
he
ought
to
got
20
years
for
the
rape,”
but
the
life
takes
care
of
the
20
years
so
we
don't
have
to
add
a
redundant
figure
of
justice
for
action,
for
all
i
know
probably
true.
