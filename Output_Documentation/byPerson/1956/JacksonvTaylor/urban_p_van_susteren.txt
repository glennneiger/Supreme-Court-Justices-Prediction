may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
the
case
originally
arose
as
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
directed
to
the
warden
as
a
lewisburg
penitentiary
that
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
brought
before
the
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
pennsylvania.
on
may
7,
1956,
the
board
--
the
court
of
appeals
announced
its
decision
refusing
to
grant
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
free
the
prisoner,
and
this
court
has
granted
certiorari.
the
fact
of
the
case
of
brief
is
this.
petitioner
jackson
and
the
another
soldier,
named
fowler,
who
is
the
petitioner
under
case
number
620,
together
with
another
soldier
named
de
coster
were
brought
to
trial
before
a
court-martial
was
convened
in
korea
on
june
8,
1951.
there,
they
were
charged
in
with
two
counts.
first,
premeditated
murder
and
second,
rape.
the
court
found
the
defendant,
all
three
of
them
in
a
joint
trial,
guilty
of
murder
and
not
guilty
of
rape
but
guilty
of
attempted
rape.
thereupon,
the
law
officer
of
the
court
advised
the
court
that
the
minimum
sentence
was
life
imprisonment
and
the
maximum
sentence
was
death.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
fact
that
the
instruction
is
given
to
those
outside
of
the
directions
contained
in
the
manual
for
court-martial.
it
is
only
incidentally
of
some
importance.
the
court
picked
the
sentence,
life
imprisonment.
there
was
no
sentence,
separate
sentence
of
any
kind
for
the
attempted
rape.
it
was
just
the
one
gross
sentence.
thereafter,
the
sentence
was
and
the
findings
of
guilty
were
reviewed
by
the
commanding
general
for
korean
area,
a
proper
person
and
they
were
approved
in
full
sentence
and
the
findings
of
guilty.
and
thereafter,
a
routine
vastly
came
before
the
board
of
review
in
the
office
of
the
--
the
judge
advocate
general
of
the
army.
the
board
of
review
found
that
the
record
failed
to
show
any
evidence
that
the
activities
that
these
three
soldiers
was
in
any
way
connected
with
the
death
of
the
woman.
and
thereupon,
it
held
that
the
murder
charge
should
be
set
aside,
but
the
attempted
rape
charged
for
conviction
was
sustained.
but
instead
of
setting
aside
the
entire
penalty,
in
ordering
a
new
trial,
the
board
of
review
conceived
its
authority
or
its
proper
function
to
be
that
it
should
make
then
and
there
an
initial
determination
of
what
the
sentence
should
be.
the
opinion
as
it
is
written,
indicates
that
that
board
of
review
felt
that
it
should
determine
what
is
an
appropriate
sentence,
but
in
the
order
part
of
the
--
of
the
decision,
it
says
that
the
sentence
--
that
so
much
of
the
sentence
had
exceeds
20
years,
which
is
the
maximum
for
attempted
rape
shall
be
set
aside
or
take
that
so
much
of
the
life
imprisonment
sentence
as
it
exceeds
20
years
is
excessive
and
shall
be
set
aside
and
the
other
20
years
shall
be
affirmed.
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
the
--
the
--
quite
that,
sir.
the
complaint
is
that
the
board
of
review
had
no
authority
or
power
to
make
that
sentence.
it
was
limited
to
authority
to
return
it
for
rehearing
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
on
the
proper
sentence.
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
yes.
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
the
law
--
the
law
--
the
code
–
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
provide
that
a
rehearing
shall
be
conducted
before
a
board
composed
of
officers,
not
members
of
the
trial.
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
the
--
it
will
be
referred
for
a
new
trial
or
a
rehearing
before
a
new
court-martial
with
none
of
the
same
officers
of
that
hearing.
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
no,
only
as
to
sentence.
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
with
a
new
court-martial.
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
the
code
provision
isn't
specific
on
the
subject.
it
speaks
of
a
rehearing,
and
then,
it
doesn't
refer
to
what
you
do
when
you
have
a
rehearing
in
a
situation
such
--
such
as
this
where
the
penalty
has
been
set
aside
and
sentence
is
set
aside,
but
the
conviction
remains.
the
code
is
silent.
it
doesn't
fill
in
there.
that's
the
source
and
perhaps
the
most
of
our
trouble.
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
i
do
not
wish
to
say
that.
the
code
is
silent
in
situations
like
this
in
a
--
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
that
the
board
of
review
will
return
it
for
rehearing.
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
i
feel
that
on
the
rehearing,
that
the
proper
thing,
do
--
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
leave
open
to
the
court-martial
the
function
to
determine
all
of
the
things
that
happened
here
and
then
permit
the
court-martial.
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
no,
sir.
i
don't
feel
that
we
can
ever
claim
a
right
to
a
--
a
retrial
on
the
question
of
guilt.
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
correct.
that
is
as
i
would
interpret
the
proper,
correct,
reasonable
application
of
the
code
provisions
to
this
situation.
now,
the
--
the
--
it
is
our
contention
that
first
of
all,
the
code,
article
66
does
not
grant
to
the
board
of
review
the
right
to
make
an
initial
determination
of
a
proper
sentence.
and
secondly,
if
that
article,
article
66
should
be
so
interpreted
as
to
give
the
board
of
review
that
authority,
then,
the
article,
in
its
application
to
this
case,
would
be
contrary
tot
the
ex
post
facto
provisions
of
the
constitution.
i
would
like
to
take
up
those
arguments
in
that
order.
first,
that
they
do
not
have
the
authority
in
article
66.
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
a
new
trial
by
a
whole
new
court-martial,
but
i
don't
feel
that
we
can
still
have
the
right
to
retry
the
issue
of
guilt.
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
just
on
the
question
of
sentence.
article
66
is
the
only
part
of
the
code,
which
gives
to
the
board
any
authority
whatever
to
review,
cases
of
this
kind.
it's
the
only
section.
it
provides
first
of
all,
that
the
board
of
review
shall
act
only
with
respect
to
finding
then
sentences
as
approved
by
the
convening
authority,
the
convening
authority
being
always
the
general
or
other
officers
who
are
appointed
to
court-martial.
i
see
that
it
follows
that
we
can
read
that
sentence
as
this
that
it
shall
act
only
in
respect
to
sentences
which
have
been
imposed
by
a
court-martial,
because
a
convening
authority
cannot
approve
any
sentence
unless
it
has
been
approved,
unless
it
has
been
passed
by
a
court-martial.
if
we
carry
on
to
the
next
sentence,
if
you
find
that
it
is
a
limiting
or
negativing
sentence.
it
says
that
it
shall
approve
only
such
findings
of
guilt
and
the
sentence
or
such
harder
amount
of
it
and
it
finds
correct
in
law
and
in
fact,
and
determines
on
the
base
of
the
entire
record
should
be
approved.
i
contend
that
the
board
of
review
has
read
that
clause
of
that
sentence
to
mean
it
shall
affirm
such
findings
of
fact
as
it
--
as
it
remake
or
--
or
such
a
sentence
as
it
rebuilds,
or
remakes,
or
redetermines
as
to
be
correct.
there
is
no
positive
language
there
at
all.
we
come
to
the
next
paragraph
and
it
says
this,
"if
the
board
of
review
sets
aside
the
findings
and
sentence,
it
may
order
a
rehearing,
except
under
certain
--
certain
circumstances
where
the
setting
aside
is
based
on
lack
of
sufficient
evidence
in
the
record,
then
they
may
not.”
but
there
it
is,
the
--
if
the
board
sets
aside
the
findings
and
sentence,
it
may
order
a
rehearing.
if
it
does
not
order
a
rehearing,
it
shall
order
that
the
charges
be
dismissed.
now,
that's
the
substance
of
all
that
the
statute,
the
code
gives
important
review.
the
opposition
respondent
argues
perhaps
that
by
implication
that
authority
rests
there.
perhaps,
the
strongest
argument
is
that
any
other
system
is
too
difficult
to
handle.
they
would
quote
from
us
the
decisions
from
the
court
of
military
appeals
which
says
that,
“in
the
military
field
or
in
the
military
scope,
rehearing
is
impractical,
if
not,
impossible."
that,
i
do
not
agree
with
at
all.
retrial
in
the
military
sphere,
especially
in
time
of
peace
and
this
code
was
pass
during
time
of
peace
is
as
simple
and
perhaps
easier
or
simpler
than
it
is
in
a
civilian
sphere.the
selection
of
officers
is
by
command,
by
fire
from
the
general
officer.
there
is
no
need
to
call
a
number
of
jurors
and
find
excuses
who
cannot
appear.
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
oh,
i
believe
it
would
have
to
hear
all
of
the
evidence
concerning
the
facts
of
the
case
up
to,
but
not
including
the
facts
that
the
woman
died
by
some
method,
means
or
hand
unknown
sometime
later.
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
this
occurred
in
march
--
on
march
16,
1951.
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
yes,
sir.
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
at
this
juncture,
it
is
i
think
impractical.
but
if
be
impractical,
that
is
not
the
burden
or
the
tough
luck
of
the
petitioner.
i
hold
that
this
court
upon
findings
that
he
is
–-
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
i
still
feel
that
the
court-martial
can
and
may
impose
sentence
because
any
other
interpretation
would
be
so
–-
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
i
think
it
has
to
be
--
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
i
think
they
have
to
read
from
the
record
of
trial
in
the
past.
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
i
--
i
fear
so.
that
would
–
it's
in
a
realm
outside.
it's
precisely
the
question
necessary
here,
so
i
haven't
drawn
into
it.
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
my
contention
is
that
this
man
is
imprisoned
under
a
void
sentence,
imposed
by
a
tribunal
having
no
authority
to
impose
that
sentence.
and
therefore,
under
authority
of
cases,
and
this
is
decided
by
this
court,
he's
entitled
to
a
discharge.
the
second
question
of
what
the
army
intends
to
do
will
await
the
army
actual
action
in
grabbing
them
and
putting
him
up
in
the
trial.
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
20
years.
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
yes,
sir.
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
about
it.
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
well,
you
see,
the
--
the
--
in
factual
situation,
you
--
you've
proposed,
takes
away
all
of
the
sting,
all
of
the
unfairness
that
the
present
situation
involves.
here,
we
do
not
know
whether
the
court-martial
would
have
imposed
a
sentence
of
five
years,
or
one
year,
or
10
years
form
that
count.
and
so,
we
contend
that
such
an
interpretation
as
to
give
to
the
board
of
review
the
right
to
make
an
initial
determination
which
is
at
the
same
time
a
final
and
last
determination
is
so
grossly
unfair
that
the
statute
should
not
be
interpreted
to
give
to
the
board
that
power
by
inference.
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
to
litigate
it,
cut
it
down
--
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
--
but
--
but
no
one
will
contend
that
a
reviewing
--
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
--
authority
has
the
authority
to
increase
it
or
to
reinstate
findings
of
not
guilty,
only
to
cut
down
to
--
give
clemency
and
to
--
to
remit
or
set
off
the
excessive
portion
which
is
illegal.
but
i'd
like
to
suppose
a
fact
like
this.
suppose
that
a
court-martial,
improperly
and
erroneously,
found
him
have
sentenced
the
lads
to
a
life
imprisonment
on
the
murder
trial,
and
then
imposed
a
five-year
penalty
on
the
attempted
rape
charge,
suppose
to
run
concurrently.
the
concurrent
sentence
would
probably
be
set
aside
by
the
commanding
general
because
it
is
the
army's
idea
that
the
concurrent
sentence
is
improper.
i
find
nothing
of
that
in
the
code
itself
as
presently
enacted,
but
the
uniform
on
varying
experience
for
years
back
has
been
one
draw
sentence.
the
writers
--
the
scholars
on
military
jurisprudence
is
to
the
same
effect.
now,
if
the
army
had
or
--
and
if
the
commanding
general
had
set
aside
that
concurrent
sentence,
and
thereupon,
and
--
and
held
to
the
full
life
term.
thereupon,
it
went
to
the
board
of
review,
and
the
board
of
review
then
determined
that
the
life
sentence
is
wrong
and
it
should
be
reduced
to
20
years,
which
is
the
maximum
for
attempted
rape.
then
what?
does
the
board
have
that
authority
to
override
the
court-martial?
what
we
know
the
court-martial
will
do.
surely,
i
don't
think
anyone
supposes
the
court
before
the
board
of
review
would
have
that
authority.
but
if
it
doesn't
have
that
authority,
how
can
we
say
that
unequivocally
and
affirmatively
the
record
shows
that
the
board
did
not
exceed
its
authority?
it
might
appear
argumentatively,
inferentially
on
a
negative
way
that
the
board
did
not
appeal
to
its
authority.
but
so
long
as
we
don't
know
what
the
board
of
review
would
have
done
to
those
soldiers,
they
have
not
–
the
record
does
not
show
affirmatively
and
unequivocally,
which
is
the
requirement
in
the
wrongful
case
decided
by
this
court.
that
the
board
in
its
proceedings
conformed
to
law
or
--
or
followed
the
statute
applicable
and
that
the
judgement
conformed
the
law.
i
would
like
to
take
a
few
minutes
now
on
this
question
of
--
of
violation
to
the
ex
post
facto
provision
constantly.
it
is
our
contention
that
–
let
me
first
of
all
state
that
the
code
of
military
justice,
uniform
code
went
into
effect
on
may
31,
9151.
that
was
several
weeks
or
months
after
the
crime
is
committed.
the
alleged
were
tried
on
june
8
of
1951,
eight
days
after
the
effective
date.
it
is
our
contention
that
under
article
50
of
the
prior
code,
this
soldier
was
required
or
--
or
this
–
all
three
of
these
soldiers
would
have
had
their
cases
referred
back
to
the
court-martial
for
a
rehearing.
if
you
interpret
article
66
is
not
doing,
then
it
means
this
soldier
has
only
just
one
chance
before
the
board
of
review.
it
makes
a
determination,
it's
final
and
last.
but
if
you
send
it
under
article
50,
send
it
back
to
the
board
or
to
the
court-martial,
then
the
soldier
has
two
additional
chances.
the
court-martial
can
fix
a
penalty
and
it
might
be
far
lower.
if
he
doesn't,
the
commanding
general
might
reduce
it.
and
if
he
doesn't,
then
he
still
has
the
board
of
review
as
its
final
chance.
now,
this
is
not
merely
a
matter
procedure,
a
sentence
in
the
military
establishment,
in
the
military
hierarchy,
the
tribunal
of
all
three
steps
is
not
complete,
and
it's
not
final.
it
is
only
interlocutory
or
inchoate,
as
one
writer
has
referred
to
it
until
all
three
of
these
people
have
act
in
it.
and
i
contend
that
it's
far
more
important
in
the
modern
day
that
a
--
that
a
soldier
or
any
accused
person
--
let
me
say
this.
the
question
of
who
is
going
to
determine
a
sentence
where
there
are
maximum
and
minimum
limits
is
far
more
important
than
what
are
the
maximum
and
minimum
limits.
if
for
example,
you
can
think
of
the
--
of
permitting
the
--
the
father
of
the
victim
of
a
rape
attack
to
fix
the
penalty
or
have
any
--
any
part
of
determining
the
penalty,
it's
far
more
important
to
the
accused
than
it
is
to
perhaps
raise
the
maximum
and
minimum
limit
by
two
or
three
years.
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
comment
in
a
good
deal
of
what
has
been
said
by
opposing
counsel.
it
goes
away
from
the
absolutely
necessary
and
fundamental
concept
that
this
board
of
review
has
only
those
powers
which
are
given
with
by
the
statute
and
those
which
must
necessarily
be
inferred
permit.
now,
what
much
have
what
has
been
said
might
have
some
effect
upon
the
matter
of
interpreting
that
statute,
but
otherwise,
the
board
of
review
nor
the
court
of
military
appeals
does
not
have
a
--
a
system
of
rules
as
the
common
law
rules
with
which
it
can
guide
itself
and
tailor
its
remedies
in
its
procedures
to
meet
the
exigencies
of
each
situation.
in
connection
with
comments
upon
the
number
of
appeals
that
there
were
to
the
board
of
review,
not
only
a
number
of
appeals,
a
number
of
times
that
the
board
of
review
set
aside
either
the
findings
or
the
sentence.
and
in
connection
with
it
as
being
used
here
to
indicate
to
this
court,
the
burden
upon
the
military
establishment
to
send
those
back
for
a
new
trial
or
rehearing,
at
least
we
point
out,
first
of
all
that
the
law
is
--
that
boards
of
review
or
that
court-martials
will
use
their
own
discretion
in
fixing
a
penalty.
i
read
from
the
manual
for
courts-martial,
page
121
or
122,
down
paragraph
four,
“courts
will,
however,
exercise
their
own
discretion
and
will
not
adjudge
sentences
known
to
be
excessive
in
reliance
upon
the
mitigating
action
of
the
convening
or
the
higher
authority.”
now,
i'll
take
to
hear
more
journals
as
quoted
in
the
respondent's
brief
on
page
419
of
that
issue,
an
article
written
by
the
editors
of
the
yale
law
review
quoted
in
this
brief
and
they
comment
us,
at
the
top
of
page
419.
the
court
fail
to
--
referring
to
the
court
in
chicago
first
of
all,
the
court
for
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
de
coster
case.
the
court
fails
to
consider
that
in
practice,
courts-martial
performed
a
function
nearer
to
that
of
the
juries
in
a
court.
and
here
it
is,
“courts-martials
are
composed
of
laymen,
all
though
they
theoretically
can
impose
whatever
sentence
they
deemed
fit.
in
the
great
majority
of
single
conviction
cases,
they
actually
impose
the
maximum
sentence
permissible.
the
final
sentence
is
set
upon
review
by
the
legally
trained
boards.”
now,
if
the
army
would
follow
the
plain
simple
letter
of
the
law,
and
tell
the
court-martial
to
adjudge
a
penalty
which
is
correct
and
proper
in
their
own
mind
as
the
congress
intended
to,
they
wouldn't
had
he
cluttered
and
clogged
up
there
in
the
board
of
review,
and
they
would
not
have
the
necessity
for
all
of
those
rehearings.
now,
taking
up
another
subject,
and
that
is
the
question
of
the
basis
or
reason
for
the
number
of
changes
that
have
been
made
and
considering
it
in
the
light
of
how
frequently
rehearings
would
be
necessary.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
situation
where
the
sentence
imposed
by
the
court-martial
was
greater
than
the
maximum
permissible
for
the
count
that
has
been
held
to
be
good.
i
would
like
to
take
the
court's
attention
back
to
the
early
days
of
these
court's
existence,
the
case
of
--
united
states
versus
clawson
cited
in
my
brief.
in
that
case,
clawson
and
an
army
officer
had
been
convicted
by
a
court-martial
of
a
number
of
offenses
of
the
type
of
bribery
and
embezzlement
and
so
forth.
the
president
was
the
appointing
authority
for
the
court,
so
the
president
reviewed
the
case.
the
president
set
aside
a
number
of
those
convictions,
but
he
did
not
change
the
penalty.
i
believe
the
penalty
was
five
years.
on
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
this
court
announced
or
adopted
what
we
might
call
the
lord
mansfield
rule,
saying
that
prior
to
the
declaration
of
independence,
it
was
announced
by
lord
mansfield
that
where
there
is
a
general
verdict
and
a
general
sentence
imposed
upon
a
number
of
counts
and
it
is
later
found
that
some
of
those
counts
be
held
not
good,
it
will
be
presumed
that
the
court
levied
the
sentence
upon
the
count
that
was
good.
now,
that
has
been
adopted,
that
was
the
--
the
law
in
this
--
in
this
court.
that
was
adopted
by
the
army
and
the
army
has
operated
under
that
principle
all
during
these
years.
so,
when
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
was
launched,
that
--
i
wonder
when
it
started.
that
principle,
which
has
been
followed
all
during
those
years,
we
must
concede
change
into
light
with
it.
it
followed
along.
we
cannot
argue
that
that
principle
is
dead.
i
think
it
lives.
but
that
principle
cannot
be
extended
to
a
situation
like
this
because
here,
the
lord
mansfield
rule,
the
clawson
case
reiterated
in
a
number
of
other
cases
since
that
time,
by
its
own
words
it
excludes
this
type
of
case,
because
here,
we
know
that
the
court
did
not
levied
a
sentence
on
the
count
that
is
good
because
it
would
have
been
a
maximum
of
20
years.
we
know
that
they
levied
sentence
on
the
bad
count
for
the
--
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
well,
we
must
presume
that
the
court,
were
honorable
gentlemen.
they
have
been
informed
by
their
law
officer
that
the
maximum
penalty
for
--
or
the
minimum
penalty
for
life
imprisonment
for
--
for
murder
was
life
imprisonment.
at
least
--
you
see,
under
the
lord
mansfield
rule,
it
said,
“it
will
be
presumed
that
the
court
levied
sentence
on
the
count
which
has
been
held
good,”
unless,
there
is
something
in
the
record
to
show
the
contrary,
that's
it.
now,
we
know
that
the
court-martial,
i
presume,
we
can
see
from
the
record
that
court-martial
didn't
levy
a
--
a
life
imprisonment
sentence
for
the
attempted
rape.
furthermore,
the
record
does
show
that
the
court
had
been
advised
by
the
law
officer
that
the
penalty
for
murder
was
life
imprisonment
and
they
probably
went
ahead
and
put
in
the
life
imprisonment.
so,
the
lord
mansfield
doctrine
cannot
--
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
perhaps,
sir,
but
in
discussing
this
situation
where
it
is
not
and
--
and
taking
up
this
--
this
proposition
that
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
army
to
burden
itself
with
all
of
these
rehearings
and
appeals.
i
say
that
it
is
not
necessary,
and
i
say
that
we
don't
want
to
extend
the
rule
to
all
cases.
we
limit
it
to
those
cases,
which
do
not
come
within
that
lord
mansfield
doctrine.
in
other
words,
i
say
yes,
it
is
proper
for
the
board
of
review
in
setting
aside
some
of
the
charges,
nevertheless,
to
keep
the
penalty
as
it
was
without
remitting
the
thing
if
it
appears
that
the
sentence
as
originally
imposed
was
within
the
maximum
limit
for
the
count
which
they
sustain,
then
the
doctrine,
the
lord
mansfield
doctrine
operate
--
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
--
whether
they
don't
have
to
change.
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
no,
sir,
the
maximum
penalty
for
the
good
count
is
20
years
or
--
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
--
life
imprisonment.
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
oh,
yes.
but
you
see,
that
would
be
a
--
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
--
wholly
court
doing
that.
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
that
was
the
appellate
tribunal
locking
it
off,
but
the
mansfield
doctrine
is
that
when
--
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
--
a
trial
court
--
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
well,
you
see,
that
is
the
only
--
the
only
place
where
the
board
of
review
has
any
basis
for
any
authority
of
any
kind
to
tailor
a
sentence
to
or
to
--
yes,
to
tailor
or
fit
a
sentence
to
a
crime.
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
paragraph?
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
b
and
d
--
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
--
of
section
66,
yes
indeed
so.
if
--
if
we
read
it
as
i
read
then
it's
true.
but
if
we
read
it
as
counsel
for
the
respondent
reads
it,
then
it
may
not
be
true.
mr.
urban
p.
van
susteren
i
--
i
think
i
have
spelled
out
that
it
will
not
in
this
court
announce
the
rule
that
the
board
of
review
have
no
--
no
authority
or
power
to
do
as
it
does.
it
will
not
require
the
board
of
review
to
send
back
all
of
those
cases
for
rehearing
whenever
they
set
aside
one,
or
two,
or
three,
or
some
of
the
convictions,
because
that
old
rule
is
still
there
to
permit
them
to
--
to
keep
the
original
sentence.
now,
in
his
argument,
counsel
for
respondent
talks
about
the
--
the
elaborate
protection
which
congress
had
directed
against
harsh
penalties
in
showing
that
the
convening
authority
can
reduce
and
set
aside
that
cannot
increase.
that,
i
say,
is
precisely
the
mischief
involved
in
what
have
been
done
here.
this
congress
intended
that
a
soldier
should
have
all
of
those
protections.
here,
the
solider
has
had
none.
he
has
no
chance
for
any
further
review,
and
i
believe
counsel
has
admitted
that
the
finding
here
in
this
case
was
final.
there
was
no
other
type
of
appeal.
then,
if
we
assume
that
congress
could
provide
as
there
was
some
discussion
about
it.
assuming
that
congress
did
have
the
authority
to
provide
that
the
penalty
could
be
fixed
ab
initio
by
the
board
of
review,
nevertheless,
i
say
the
important
fact
is
congress
did
not
do
it,
and
that
the
board
of
review
has
no
power
other
than
those
granted,
either
by
the
specific
letter
of
the
statute
or
by
necessary
inconvenient.
