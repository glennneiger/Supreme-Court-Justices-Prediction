justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
before
you
do
that,
did
i
understand
you
to
answer
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
you
thought
there
should
be
a
new
trial
on
the
merits
by
new
a
board
of
officers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
on
the
question
of
sentence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
under
your
proposition,
exactly
what
evidence
would
be
taken?
i
gather
you
--
you've
conceived
guilt.
now,
what
would
be
the
evidence
that
would
be
heard
by
the
new
board?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
how
long
ago
did
this
incident
occur?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
that's
six
--
six
years
ago?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
--
how
practical
is
a
review
of
the
testimony
sure
of
the
death,
at
this
juncture?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
suppose
they
--
suppose
--
supposed
they
can't
get
a
single
one
of
the
witnesses
at
this
time,
then
what
happens?
you
pleaded
guilty
and
what
--
what
then
is
to
follow?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
but
i'm
trying
to
get,
what
â€“-
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
what
the
result
of
your
--
what
--
what
was
followed?
suppose
they
can't
remember
and
those
witnesses
are
not
available,
so
there
can't
be
any
evidence
before
the
new
court-martial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
impose
sentence,
merely
upon
what
they
read.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
you
get
to
that,
and
that
--
those
figures
of
thousands
of
cases
you
gave
us,
is
there
any
figure
of
the
number
of
instances
like
this
where
the
gross
sentence
was
a
sentence
for
an
offense
a,
sentence
greater
than
could
in
law
be
imposed
for
the
lesser
offense
and
then
the
greater
offenses
stricken
out?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
--
i'm
just
wondering
how
helpful
those
figures
of
thousands
of
cases
are,
we
don't
know
how
many
situations
such
as
this
one
have
been
acted
upon
before.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
didn't
understand
it
that
way.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
may
be,
but
as
i
understood
the
argument,
counsel
was
as
applied
to
this
situation.
they
weren't
attacking
it
generally,
as
i
got
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
what
you
said.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
is
this,
mr.
spritzer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
affirm
ordinarily
means
knowingly
to
know
what
it
is
that
you're
putting
the
stamp
of
approval
upon
or
otherwise,
doesn't
it?
in
other
words,
this
is
an
animation
on
that,
an
implication
on
that
that
affirmed
a
sentence
that
the
board
of
review
knows
about?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
differently
in
military
law
than
it
is
in
ordinary
english?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
that
affirmed
only
the
sentence
or
such
part
as
it
finds
correct.
let's
not
presuppose
that
knows
what
the
sentence
is.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
spritzer,
excuse
me
--
finish
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
is
it
that
there's
difference
between
the
case
you
suggested
to
us
of
an
adoption
of
desertion
to
absent
without
leave
that
that
instance,
there
never
was
a
court
martial
finding
that
he
was
guilty
of
being
absent
without
leave?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
here,
we
do
have
a
court-martial
finding
that
they
were
guilty
of
rape.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
it
entirely
different?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know,
but
we
--
the
first
finding
of
guilt
of
being
absent
without
leave
is
a
finding
with
the
board
of
review.
and
perhaps,
you
could
justify
the
imposition
of
a
sentence
based
on
its
own
finding,
where
here
you
have
a
finding
of
rape
without
an
opportunity
for
the
two
clemency
steps
that
ordinarily
would
have
been
available
to
these
soldiers
had
--
had
there
not
have
been
introduce
the
erroneous
finding
of
murder.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
never
--
that's
never
even
thought,
there
again
when
he
thought
to
convicting
him
of
being
merely
in
offense
of
absent
without
leave.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
one
other
thing
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
respect
to
those
figures,
is
this
not
more
often
the
situation?
there
may
be
convictions
of
multiple
offenses
and
a
gross
sentence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
upon
review,
the
board
of
review
doesn't
set
aside
any
of
the
convictions,
but
does
feel
that
the
gross
sentence
is
inordinate
and
ameliorates
it
by
reducing
it,
letting
the
conviction
stand.
isn't
that
more
often
the
situation
in
that
that
we
have
here?
