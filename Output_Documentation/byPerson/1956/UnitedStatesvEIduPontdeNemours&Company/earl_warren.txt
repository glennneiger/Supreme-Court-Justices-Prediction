chief

percentage-wise?
chief
justice
earl

that

i
thought
you
said
$700,000,000
was
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
before
you
leave
--
leave
that.
when
did
the
control
of
--
of
du
pont
cease
over
the
stock
that
was
sold
to
these
various
people,
their
pension
plan
and
so
as

get
rid

chief
justice
earl

recess

mr.

chief

you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
figure
which
you've
just
given
was
than
93%
that
mr.
davis
spoke
of?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
he
substantially
correct
in
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
you
have
just
computed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
if
chrysler
does
buy
it
from
--
from
a
company
that
sells
only
to
it
or
--
or
substantially.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
in
the
relative
field
of
--
of
refrigerator
manufacturers
or
all
of
the
paint,
all
of
the
finish
in
the
paint.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
antifreeze
--
antifreeze.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
sell
it
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
cox,
before
you
leave
the
percentages
again,
may
i
ask
this
question.
we've
been
--
we've
been
discussing
here
the
products
of
du
pont
that
have
been
purchased
by
general
motors
in
large
percentages.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
there
any
products
used
by
general
motors
and
--
and
manufactured
by
du
pont
that
are
not
used
by
general
motors
or
only
used
in
very
small
quantities?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
percentage
does
--
what
percentage
does
general
motors
use,
do
you
know?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
what
--
what
percentage
of
--
of
that
kind
of
commodity
used
by
general
motors
does
it
buy
from
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
mr.
cox,
you
don't
have
to
do
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
--
mr.
cox,
i
--
i
understood
mr.
davis
to
--
to
think
there
were
some
significance
to
the
--
to
the
informality
with
which
general
motors
turned
this
patent
over
to
du
pont
without
any
--
without
any
deliberation,
without
any
negotiation,
just
sort
of
turned
it
over
to
them
and
then
at
a
later
date,
they
reduced
it
to
a
contract.
you
--
you
seemed
to
feel
that
--
that
wasn't
dealing
at
arms
length
as
you
would
expect
between
a
patentor
and
a
manufacturing
company.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
also,
the
--
you
figured
there's
no
significance
to
the
fact
that
when
du
pont
signed
it
for
general
motors
and
the
other
du
pont
signed
it
for
the
du
pont
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i'm
just
asking.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
stern.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
contend
mr.
stern
that
the
control
ended
in
1923?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
now,
when
did
this
control
cease?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
that
--
that
mean
also
that
the
control
of
du
pont
over
general
motors
ended
at
that
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
instance,
the
--
the
reason
i
ask
you
is
because
they
retained
the
voting
rights
on
all
the
stock,
the
difference
between
38%
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
23
for
a
number
of
years.
the
last
of
it
is
about
37%,
i
think
38%.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
--
how
do
you
make
the
dividing
line?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
i
understand
mr.
davis
correctly
when
i
thought
he
said
that
--
that
in
the
early
days
when
mr.
sloan,
mr.
raskob
and
the
other
people
who
were
shown
in
this
exhibit
as
having
gotten
this
big
stock
interest
for
one-tenth
of
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
value
in
the
couple
of
years,
were
selected
by
the
--
well,
yes,
that's
right.that's
--
that's
what
he
said.
i
think
about
80,000,
wasn't
it?
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
80,000
they
paid.
in
about
two
years,
worth
two
million,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
was
going
to
ask
you
this.
is
it
correct
that
they
--
that
du
pont
selected
those
men
who
were
to
get
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
--
i'm
mistaken
on
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he
was
one
of
the
beneficiaries,
wasn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
will.
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
how
big
a
business
was
this
tetraethyl
that
is
--
do
you
have
any
idea?
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
generally
speaking.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
--
i
have
your
brief.
i
have
your
brief
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
your
pages
are
--
are

chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
they're

there
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
57.
mine
goes
to
51,
52
and
61.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
how
far
of
this
affect
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
