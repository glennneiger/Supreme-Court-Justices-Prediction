justice
stanley
reed
what
--
what
do
you
mean
by
du
pont?
justice
stanley
reed
not
the
individual?
justice
stanley
reed
stockholders.
justice
stanley
reed
all
right.
justice
stanley
reed
it
appears
they
were
charged
having
conspired
to
as
i
understand
it.
justice
stanley
reed
when
--
when
you
speak
of
the
presence
of
du
pont
in
the
stockholders
meeting,
does
that
mean
they
were
there
with
someone
representing
then
to
both?
justice
stanley
reed
not
a
proxy?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
they
--
they
must
have
given
proxy
to
someone
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
if
both
of
you
--
justice
stanley
reed
and
get
--
that
--
that
would
be
being
there,
it
refers
to
me
that
they
were
there
represented
by
someone
who
had
authority
to
vote
their
stock.
well,
was
that
what
do
they
have
there,
23%
of
the
stock?
justice
stanley
reed
that
probably
took
50%
for
a
quorum?
justice
stanley
reed
(inaudible)
justice
stanley
reed
so,
they
can
have
--
there
could
have
been
other
representations
there
in
the
last
few
years
besides
du
pont?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
that
--
that
would
be
--
justice
stanley
reed
what
i
was
thinking
of
--
of
proxies
from
stockholders,
other
than
du
pont,
whether
they
were
--
whether
you
were
speaking
of
actual
presence
there?
justice
stanley
reed
so
a
great
many
stockholders
didn't
even
bother
to
send
their
proxy?
justice
stanley
reed
i
believe
you
can
call
fights
(inaudible)
justice
stanley
reed
power
to
control
alone?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
assuming
there's
a
power
then
is
that
all
you
have
to
prove?
justice
stanley
reed
have
a
tendency
to
do
it?
justice
stanley
reed
now,
when
you
use
the
word
combination,
does
that
mean
that
there's
a
combination
here
between
general
motors
and
du
pont?perhaps
you're
going
to
take
up
--
justice
stanley
reed
(voice

been
discussing
only
facts.
i
don't
want
to
bring
in
the
(inaudible).
justice
stanley
reed
well,
don't
--
don't
do
it
if
it
interrupts
you.
justice
stanley
reed
if
--
if
i
--
well
if
du
pont
buys
the
stock
with
general
motors,
that
makes
a
combination?
justice
stanley
reed
it
--
it
doesn't
have
a
--
the
sense
of
an
agreement
between
two?
justice
stanley
reed
and
--
and,
of
course,
the
word
combination
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
appears
in
this
act.
so
you're
not
using
it
at
--
in
a
sense,
that
you're
using
it
in
the
sense
of
--
as
though
it
were
a
conspiracy,
combination
conspiracy
in
restraint
of
trade?
justice
stanley
reed
of
the
contract?
justice
stanley
reed
is
there
a
contract
here?
justice
stanley
reed
i
understand
there's
no
conspiracy
(inaudible)
justice
stanley
reed
yes,
yes.
no
--
no
contract
and
no
conspiracy?
justice
stanley
reed
mr.
davis,
the
--
of
what
--
then
or
do
you
rely
on,
too,
to
the
attempt
to
monopolize?
justice
stanley
reed
(voice
overlap)
--
at
this
part
your
argument
you're
directing
yourself
to
(inaudible)
combination?
justice
stanley
reed
before
we
--
before
we
leave
the
first
section
of
combination,
what
--
what
do
you
say
in
your
brief
as
to
the
--
whether
any
such
interpretation
has
ever
been
placed
on
the
word
combination.
justice
stanley
reed
no
--
no
such
authority.
justice
stanley
reed
combination
would
be
like
the
foreign
products
were
used
(inaudible)
the
companies
that
manufacture
foreign
products
for
instance?
justice
stanley
reed
but
even
if
you
have
--
justice
stanley
reed
it
never
had
the
putting
together
of
--
of
all
of
the
manufacturing
process
as
we
assume
they're
shipping.
justice
stanley
reed
no,
no.
i'm
really
worried
about
restraint
of
trade,
i
think
--
justice
stanley
reed
do
you
happen
to
have
figures
of
the
total
purchases
of
general
motors,
all
lines
still?
justice
stanley
reed
it's
not
important
if
you
don't
have
it
right
(inaudible)
justice
stanley
reed
(voice
overlap)
--
varnish
and
chemicals
is
very
small
(inaudible)
justice
stanley
reed
is
it
fair
to
say
that
the
same
arguments
the
government
makes
on
the
sherman
act
is
also
applied
into
the
clayton
act?
justice
stanley
reed
now,
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
the
clayton
act
or
the
sherman
act?
justice
stanley
reed
it's
actually
the
same
--
justice
stanley
reed
based
on
the
same
facts?
justice
stanley
reed
how
--
how
is
the
division
related
to
the
general
management
of
general
motors?
justice
stanley
reed
does
the
head
of
the
division
sit
in
the
directorates
of
the
--
justice
stanley
reed
that's
--
that's
the
--
justice
stanley
reed
he
--
he
is
the
way
that
the
joint
was
placed?
justice
stanley
reed
you
mean
that
very
small
divisions,
but
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
normally
the
head
of
buick
division
would
be
a
member
of
the
board?
justice
stanley
reed
policy
in
operation?
justice
stanley
reed
you
mean
that
the
divisions
would
compete
with
one
another
for
the
purchase
of
steel?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
before
--
before
you
leave
the
--
the
paint,
would
you
straighten
me
up
on
this?
if
duco
goes
to
the
general
motors
in
the
percentage
of
93%
of
what
they
used,
what
--
what
about
the
other
automobile
manufacturers
that
you
apply
to
their
cars?
why
don't
they
use
a
proportionate
amount
of
duco?
why
is
it
that
only
general
motors,
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
it's
only
general
motors
that
takes
the
percentage,
anything
like
that?
justice
stanley
reed
the
du
pont.
justice
stanley
reed
the
chrysler
illustration
is
so
contrary
to
the
general
policy
of
large
manufacturers
as
i
understand
it
is
to
have
many
sellers.
justice
stanley
reed
suppose
that
from
the
time
of
the
purchase,
the
stock
by
general
motors
or
by
du
pont
and
general
motors
that
every
effort
that
du
pont
had
made
had
not
been
successful
in
making
sales.
they
haven't
been
able
to
increase
selling
it
at
all
or
even
get
the
--
a
good
part
of
the
general
motor's
business.
if
they
had
made
that
purchase
for
the
deliberate
purpose
of
enlarging
your
sales,
would
it
be
unlawful?
justice
stanley
reed
should
you
treat
the
--
that
legal
problem
later
or
--
justice
stanley
reed
in
their
effort
--
a
mere
effort
to
obtain,
would
--
justice
stanley
reed
a
mere
effort
to
obtain,
restraint
would
not
be
enough.
justice
stanley
reed
inevitably
in
that
power
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
but
they
wouldn't
have
(voice

justice
stanley
reed
if
--
if
he
thought
he
had
been
mistaken,
if
he
thought
he
could
exercise
power
through
his
stock
ownership
and
therefore
du
pont
should
buy
it.
justice
stanley
reed
it
would
influence
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
as
the
question
(voice

--
justice
stanley
reed
our
compelled
influence,
are
they
all
the
same?
justice
stanley
reed
anything
short
of
that
is
not
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
law?
justice
stanley
reed
he'd
have
to
be
successful.
justice
stanley
reed
what
was
the
arrangement
made
that
was
made
in
du
pont?
justice
stanley
reed
financial
related.
justice
stanley
reed
well,
it's
a
patented
product.
justice
stanley
reed
did
general
motors
continued
to
manufacture?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
it
started
out
in
general
motors?
justice
stanley
reed
it
was
passed
to
ethyl.
justice
stanley
reed
and
how
--
general
--
general
motors
got
all
the
stock?
justice
stanley
reed
general
motors
owned
half
the
stock,
du
pont
have
none?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
i
wasn't
clear
and
i
still
--
i
--
i
thought
general
motors
had
a
patent
that
was
worth
something
to
it
and
they
--
they
understood
that
it
had
a
good
patent.
justice
stanley
reed
now,
mr.
kettering
had
(voice

--
justice
stanley
reed
then
--
that
--
that
was
disposed
of,
you
say
to
the
ethyl
corporation.
justice
stanley
reed
in
which
the
stock
was
half
went
to
the
standard
oil
and
half
went
to
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
retained
by
general
motors?
justice
stanley
reed
so
the
du
pont
never
had
any
interest
in
it
at
all,
except
it
was
employed
to
develop
the
--
justice
stanley
reed
what
it
alleged
--
justice
stanley
reed
and
it
was
paid
for
that
work?
justice
stanley
reed
what
page?
so,
general
motors
got
its
profit
from
the
--
justice
stanley
reed
i
understood
that
they
thought
that
you
gave
that
--
general
motors
gave
you
an
advantage.
justice
stanley
reed
--
while
--
by
--
so
that
you
could
make
money
out
of
it.
justice
stanley
reed
(voice
overlap)
before
you
start
on
that,
what
--
what
do
you
have
to
say
in
regard
to
whether
this
is
a
combination
or
not?
do
you
concede
that?
justice
stanley
reed
it
would
be
a
combination.
justice
stanley
reed
well,
whom
--
whom
do
you
mean
when
you
say
they
and
general
motors,
the
executive
officers?
justice
stanley
reed
the
charge
--
the
charge
of
the
government
here
is
that
it
was
a
purpose
planned
by
(inaudible)
what
the
--
are
you
going
to
discuss
that
(inaudible)
justice
stanley
reed
if
--
suppose
they
failed
to
do
a
--
to
accomplish
what
they
started
out
to
do?
justice
stanley
reed
taking
--
taking
mr.
raskob's
statement
to
start
of,
assuming
that
--
you
assumed
that,
then
do
you
have
to
prove
some
necessity?
justice
stanley
reed
you
--
you
had
a
stock
ownership
that
was
important
at
least
in
stockholders
meaning,
and
--
and
you
had
du
pont
representatives
that
were
on
the
board
at
all
times.
justice
stanley
reed
so,
you
--
you
had
at
least
power
to
influence
(inaudible).
justice
stanley
reed
some
power.
justice
stanley
reed
power.
justice
stanley
reed
i
didn't
say
control.
i
said
influence.
justice
stanley
reed
assuming
they
had
a
prima
facie
case
you
--
you
embed
it
and
overcharge
it.
that's
your
position.
justice
stanley
reed
was
this
one
the
contract
that
was
later
made?
justice
stanley
reed
why
--
why
would
standard
oil
of
new
jersey
brought
into
it?
justice
stanley
reed
i
think
the
question
with
that
patent,
general
motors
contributed
its
patent.
justice
stanley
reed
and
du
pont
contributed
the
know-how.
justice
stanley
reed
your
point
is
that
they
looked
only
to
du
pont,
didn't
make
any
effort
to
go
any
place
else.
