mr.
robert
l.
stern
may
it
please
the
court.
the
major
portion
of
this
argument
allotted
to
me
have
been
to
--
to
the
questions
of
control
and
what
questions
of
law
remained
to
be
discussed
after
we
finish
discussing
the
facts
which
we
think
are
most
significant
here.
before
getting
into
the
major
point,
i'm
going
to
discuss
the
question
of
control.
i
want
to
correct
both
mr.
davis
and
mr.
cox
on
one
of
these
percentage
figures
which
the
court
may
think
is
of
some
significance.
that
93%
of
everybody
has
been
talking
about
on
paint,
was
a
figure
for
1941.
the
government's
own
brief
says
that
figure
for
1947
is
83%.
if
you
take
out
--
the
reason
i
mentioned,
that's
on
page
64
on
the
government's
brief.
if
you
look
at
the
--
if
you
take
out
ford
&
chrysler,
83%
as
we
analyze
in
our
brief
isn't
really
disproportionate
at
all.
it
was
mathematical.
taking
out
ford
&
chrysler
would
be
about
80%,
so
i
just
make
that
little
correction.
now,
i
also
want
to
say
a
word
before
i
get
into
the
question
of
control
about
the
--
this
antifreeze
episode
way
back
in
1925
and
1926
which
for
some
reason,
the
government
thinks
is
so
significant
now.
of
course
it
has
no
significance
now
at
all,
it's
supposed
to
show
some
favoritism
back
then.
but
the
government
says
that
--
is
that
the
general
motors
deliberately
slanted
its
manuals
so
as
to
favor
alcohol
which
du
pont
was
making
as
against
glycerin
which
other
people
were
making.
well,
all
general
motors
did
was
provide
eventually
that
its
manuals
would
state,
“alcohol
is
cheaper
and
hurts
the
paint
and
glycerin
is
more
expensive.”
it
will
work
properly
as
mr.
davis
said
unless
things
aren't
fitted
correctly
and
then
it
may
severely
damage
the
motor
and
nobody
suggest
that
isn't
true.
the
government
says
that's
slanted
because
the
damage
to
the
motor
without
--
where
the
damage
to
the
paint
in
the
eyes
of
the
motors
is
as
it
would.
“but
it
was
true,
and
even
the
glycerin
manufacturers
according
to
the
record
didn't
--
didn't
object
to
that
statement,
only
the
government
objects
to
it.
and
how
is
it
unfair
or
unreasonable
for
general
motors
to
give
it
to
make
a
true
statement
impartially
for
the
benefit
of
the
public
which
buys
alcohol
or
glycerin
antifreeze,
we
have
some
difficultly
in
seeing.
now,
mr.
davis
said,
“but
general
motors
bought
glycerin
itself,
which
shows
that
it
really
didn't
believe
alcohol
was
better.”
well,
there
again,
there's
a
little
confusion.
as
far
as
the
record
shows,
general
motors
didn't
buy
--
didn't
start
buying
glycerin
about
seven
years
later,
1933
to
1936.
by
that
time,
the
industry,
the
people
who
--
who
serviced
automobiles
were
permitted
with
it.
they
knew
how
to
tighten
up
automobiles
so
it
wouldn't
hurt
the
motors,
we
all
use
it
today
but
that
wasn't
at
the
time
of
this
particular
episode.
the
emphasis
the
government
puts
on
it
that
our
mind
indicates
how
far
they've
got
to
go
to
try
to
--
to
try
to
make
a
factual
case
here.
now,
on
this
question
of
--
of
control,
it's
a
basic
control
or
whatever
the
government
now
calls
it.
they
called
it
control
all
the
time
in
the
case
up
to
now,
but
now,
they're
diluting
it
and
diluting
it
and
diluting
so
i
don't
know
if
that
really
is
control
anymore
or
not.
what
they
said
in
their
briefs
was
that
this
control
is
a
--
is
a
power
in
du
pont
to
direct,
sometimes
say
to
influence,
the
business
policies
of
general
motors
closed
again
in
economic
advantage
over
its
competitors.
now,
there
are
two
aspects
of
that
which
are
important.first,
it's
a
--
it's
a
power
as
they
defined
it
in
their
briefs
at
least.
and
secondly,
it
has
to
relate
to
business
policies
or
trade
because
of
this
--
this
case
relates
to
restraints
of
trade
and
we're
not
talking
about
anything
else.
now,
what
does
power
mean?
it
means
normally
in
this
context
that
one
group
of
men
can
make
another
group
of
men
do
it
at
once.
and
here,
the
question
is,
"does
the
du
pont
company,
the
du
pont
directors
or
officers,
can
they
make
the
general
motors
officers
or
directors
do
what
they
want?"
we
know
that
in
corporation
laws,
it's
often
thought
that
minority
stockholders
have
great
power
but
their
--
the
substantial
minority
is
here
but
it's
also
--
also
were
recognized
that
the
management
may
have
great
power.
and
the
question
here
is
does
the
minority
stockholder
cannot
tell
the
management
what
to
do?
that's
an
issue
of
fact.
nobody
denies
that
and
it's
determined
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
of
each
case
as
this
court
has
--
has
several
times
held.
well
now,
the
government
seems
to
be
backing
away
from
this
a
little
bit.
they
say
that
the
--
they
admit
that
the
general
motors
executives
are
independent
people
that
they
won't
do
anything
contrary
to
the
interest
of
general
motors,
but
they
still
say
that
they
were
put
in
by
the
du
pont
people,
mr.
sloan
at
least
who
was
in
--
in
power
from
1923
to
1946.
presumably,
he
appointed
everybody
in
that
period
or
the
people
he
appointed,
appointed
the
other
people.
and
therefore,
necessarily,
du
pont
had
infiltrated
the
management.
the
only
specific
examples
they
would
have
to
refer
to
on
that
are
mr.
sloan
if
you
can
call
him
a
du
pont
man.he
was
promoted
on
his
merits
entirely
from
within
the
company
after
he
impressed
mr.
pierre
du
pont
of
how
capable
an
executive
he
was.
the
government
makes
a
lot
of
the
fact
that
mr.
pierre
appointed
him,
but
that's
the
only
thing
the
record
shows
as
to
the
reason.
mr.
pratt,
he
is
also
called
by
the
government
a
du
pont
man.
i
refer
your
honors,
i'm
not
going
to
read
it,
to
general
motors'
exhibit
201.
it's
on
--
most
of
it
is
quoted
on
page
20
of
our
brief,
but
i
commend
that
to
you
to
find
out
how
much
of
a
general
motor
of
a
du
pont's
dude
mr.
pratt
was.
he
told
the
du
pont's
of
a
lot
whenever
he
was
dealing
with
mr.
du
pont.
when
he
was
dealing
with
some
of
the
subordinates,
he
would
do
them
very
occasionally.
well
anyhow,
let's
get
back
to
how
these
executives
that
infiltrated
general
motors
so
they
would
--
so
the
general
motors
people
would
do
what
du
pont
wanted.
we
don't
have
to
speculate
as
to
this,
as
to
whether
they
would
--
du
pont
minding
which
is
really
what
the
government
is
talking
about.
mr.
raskob,
you've
heard
about.
he
is
the
man
who
in
1918
predicted
that
general
motors
would
be
controlled
by
du
pont.
look
what
happened
to
him
in
1928.
in
1928,
he
became
chairman
of
the
democratic
national
committee
and
mr.
sloan
didn't
think
that
was
consistent
with
his
job
as
spokesman
and
chief
of
the
financial
department
of
general
motors,
and
he
told
him
he
had
to
resign
one
job
or
the
other.
the
whole
du
pont
family
came
to
the
support
of
mr.
raskob.
they
thought
it
was
all
right
for
a
man
to
be
in
business
and
in
politics
at
the
same
time.
this
included
the
republican
du
pont
as
well
as
the
democratic
du
ponts.
there
were
some
democratic
du
ponts.
[laughter]
but,
what
happened?
mr.
raskob
was
forced
to
resign
and
all
of
--
later,
he
remained
in
the
general
motors
board
of
directors.
never
again
was
he
a
member
of
the
general
motors
executive
branch.
and
mr.
pierre
du
pont
who
was
the
chairman
of
the
board
as
you've
all
heard,
he
resigned
because
he
was
so
angry
at
what
mr.
sloan
did
to
mr.
raskob.
and
mr.
raskob
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
he
resigned
because
mr.
sloan
didn't
think
he
should
be
chairman
of
the
democratic
national
committee,
at
the
same
time,
he
was
the
head
of
the
financial
department
of
general
motors.
he
didn't
put
it
on
political
grounds,
your
honor.
he
said
it
would
have
been
the
same
if
it'd
been
a
republican
committee.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
but
mr.
--
mr.
coleman
du
pont,
ex-senator
coleman
du
pont
supported
mr.
raskob,
so
this
isn't
a
part
as
it
matter
at
all,
your
honor.
in
any
event,
the
great
power
of
the
du
ponts
over
general
motors
as
mr.
raskob
had
predicted
didn't
protect
mr.
raskob
10
years
after
he
made
the
prediction,
which
supports
what
we
have
said
already
about
the
trade
relations.
whatever
mr.
raskob
predicted
in
1918
as
to
du
pont
getting
a
general
motors
business
was
in
a
couple
of
years
just
proved
it
wasn't
so.
they
competed
for
it
just
as
they
did
for
anything
else.
well,
there
are
number
of
other
incidents
in
which
the
du
ponts
made
suggestions
to
the
general
motors
people,
told
them
what
they
thought
should
be
done.
i
haven't
got
time
to
go
into
many
of
them
in
the
argument,
there
in
our
brief.
the
whole
du
pont
family
opposed
mr.
sloan's
ideas
as
to
reorganization
of
the
general
motors
committees
in
1937.
all
three
du
pont
brothers
and
mr.
carpenter
i
believe,
but
mr.
sloan
went
ahead
and
reorganized
the
committees
as
he
wanted
to
have
it
done.
in
the
chapter
of
the
lead
episode
of
which
--
of
which
you've
heard,
mr.
irenee
du
pont
didn't
want
general
motors
to
negotiate
with
standard.
oil,
he
said
du
pont
should
negotiate
with
standard
oil.
but
mr.
sloan
went
ahead
and
joined
with
standard
oil
informing
the
ethyl
corporation
without
even
telling
the
du
ponts
about
it.
mr.
irenee
du
pont
opposed
sloan's
policy
of
specifying
to
get
standards
for
ethylized
gasoline.
he
opposed
sloan
and
sloan
is
the
one
who
insisted
on
closing
down
the
ethyl
production
plans
after
the
disaster
at
bayway
which
you've
heard
about.
all
of
these
things
sloan
did
or
at
least
they
did
what
sloan
wanted
and
not
what
the
du
pont's
wanted.
and
finally,
the
du
pont's
opposed
the
ethyl
corporation
going
into
the
production
of
gasoline
which
eventually
brought
them
into
intense
competition
with
the
du
pont
company
but
they
went
ahead
anyhow
and
did
it.
that
doesn't
sound
as
if
general
motors
or
the
ethyl
corporation
for
that
matter
was
controlled
by
du
pont.
well,
now,
the
government
now
says
that
it
doesn't
deny
that
the
general
motors
official's
act
could
always
in
the
interest
of
general
motors.
and
i
call
your
attention
to
the
findings
which
are
unchallenged
on
pages
316
and
321
of
the
record.
one
sentence
on
316
says,
“sloan's
testimony
on
the
record
as
a
whole
as
convincing
that
at
all
times,
he
acted
independently
and
steadfastly
in
the
interest
of
general
motors.”
that's
an
unchallenged
finding."
and
then
if
you
turn
over
to
321,
the
court
said
about
the
same
thing
or
this
time,
he
included
all
of
the
top
general
motors
executives
in
the
finding,
right
in
the
middle
of
321.
it's
also
unchallenged.
he
said,
“sloan,
kettering,
pratt,
lawrence
fisher,
lyna
and
wilson
are
among
those
who
would
have
been
influenced
if
the
government's
testimony
is
correct.”
these
men,
the
record
shows,
acted
at
all
times
solely
in
the
best
interest
of
general
motors,
and
i
think
that
means
they
weren't
considering
du
pont
at
all
certainly
in
the
context
in
which
it
has
spoken.
they
were
thinking
only
of
general
motors.
now,
what
does
the
government
mean
then
by
this
control
which
it's
talking
about?
i
think
it
comes
closer
to
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
was
suggesting
earlier.
it
really
isn't
a
control
at
all.
it
means
that
in
the
field
of
purchasing,
if
a
product
is
sold
by
du
pont,
the
general
motors
people
will
look
at
it
and
if
they
think
it's
about
as
good
as
--
as
the
competitive
product,
they'll
buy
that
without
being
told.
the
significant
thing
is
they
make
the
decision.
du
pont
doesn't
make
the
decision.
du
pont
doesn't
tell
them
what
to
do.
it
never
has
told
them
what
to
do
except
in
these
sales
efforts
to
which
mr.
cox
referred
as
to
lammot
du
pont.
mr.
cox
in
the
haste
to
finish
the
time
he
had
available
over,
he
forgot
to
say
that
all
those
efforts
by
lammot
du
pont
were
successful.
he
never
made
any
of
those
sales
he
was
trying
to
make
when
he
referred
to
the
stock
interest.
well
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
well,
that
comes
to
the
point
i'm
about
to
--
i'm
about
to
make
that
differentiation,
your
honor.
the
record
indicates
that
all
that
general
motors
is
purchasing
except
during
the
period
of
the
general
purchasing
committee
are
made
by
the
buyers
for
the
--
for
the
divisions,
the
people
whose
credibility
the
government
doesn't
challenge
and
whom
it
admits
buys
on
the
merits.
now,
i
would
like
to
give
a
couple
of
examples
about
that.
the
one
mr.
cox
cited
about
plastic
for
steering
wheels
isn't
in
the
briefs,
the
one
where
the
general
motors
buyer
said
that
he
didn't
give
a
damn
of
who
produced
the
product,
du
pont
or
anybody
else.
that's
exhibit
--
du
pont
exhibit
401
if
you
are
interested
in
following
that
dramatic
expression
up.
mr.
weckler
who
was
a
disinterested
witness
who
bought
for
buick
for
12
years,
but
by
the
time
he
testified,
he'd
been
with
the
chrysler
company
for
20
years
ending
up
as
general
manager
of
chrysler.
when
asked
why
he
bought
duco
for
buick,
was
he
motivated
in
anyway
by
filling
if
there
was
an
obligation
of
favor
that
du
pont
company,
he
said,
“no,
sir,
and
that's
an
idea
that
never
occurred
to
me.
and
i
never
know
in
my
experience
that
the
buick
motor
company
had
any
difficultly
in
buying
any
material
from
anyone
at
anytime."
and
the
antifreeze
buyer
who
--
present
general
motors
antifreeze
buyer
testified.”
for
a
while,
they
bought
almost
all
their
antifreeze
from
du
pont
until
sometime
after
the
war
when
they
found
that
somebody
out
--
they
could
get
it
from
somebody
else
on
better
terms
and
they
turned
to
this
other
supplier.
so
at
that
--
by
that
time,
only
automobile
bought
antifreeze
from
du
pont.
he
was
--
he
said,
“no
one
ever
indicated
to
me
that
we
should
favor
du
pont.
when
you
are
running
a
big
organization,
you
just
can't
run
it
with
a
lot
of
strings
tied
to
it.”
"were
there
are
any
strings
tied
to
your
purchases
of
antifreeze?"
"absolutely
not."
there
are
some
other
--
some
other
exhibits
as
to
casehardening,
a
du
pont
report.
this
is
a
contemporaneous
document
written
in
1931.
there
is
only
a
slight
difference
in
price
that's
favoring
us,
du
pont,
and
practically
no
difference
in
composition
between
ours
and
the
competitive
result.
but
here
again,
prejudice
is
against
us,
that's
at
general
motors.
these
instances
are
typical
of
the
bias
which
exist
in
favor
of
some
of
our
competitors
in
their
materials,
irrespective
of
price.
and
i
mean
you
can
call
that
a
salesman's
exaggeration.
he
was
running
to
his
own
people,
this
wasn't
prepared
for
the
court.
and
another
du
pont
report
in
1934
on
break
clearly
says,
“contacts
at
general
motors'
research
laboratories
have
been
much
less
satisfactory
than
anywhere
else.
in
fact,
only
there
have
we
met
other
than
a
cordial
reception.”
and
he
points
out
how
they're
selling
chrysler
in
rio,
the
very
same
products.
they
can't
even
get
a
reception
on
it,
the
general
motors
research
laboratories.
those
are
exhibits
also
not
in
the
briefs,
du
pont
exhibit
369
and
384.
this
record
was
just
so
vague
that
we
couldn't
find
evert
--
think
of
everything
in
time
even
to
put
in
this
big
reason
and
they're
also
pretty
big
as
you
may
have
observed.
there
is
some
talk
about
arms
length
--
absence
of
arms-length
bargaining
here
of
the
very
fact
that
they
couldn't
--
that
du
pont
couldn't
sell
to
general
motors
all
these
times
when
it
tried
to.
proves
arms-length
bargaining
in
itself,
but
there
are
great
many
general
agreements
situations
which
show
arms-length
bargaining.
and
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
a
passage
on
page
1905
of
the
record
to
1906
in
which
a
du
pont
representative
told
about
his
difficulties
in
bargaining
as
to
a
price
for
the
sale
of
stock
of
the
kinetic
company
when
du
pont
bought
it
from
general.
as
i
won't
read
that,
it
will
take
too
long
but
i
--
the
bargaining
took
10
months
before
they
could
agree
on
a
price
and
on
a
basis
that
it
was
even
greater
length
and
arms
length,
the
record
would
indicate.
well,
the
government
didn't
want
to
talk
about
the
people
who
do
the
actual
buying
and
selling.
it
wants
to
talk
about
the
central
management
of
general
motors.
it
doesn't
attack
the
credibility
of
the
buyers
and
sellers
who
testified
they
weren't
influenced
by
the
stock
ownership.
so
far
as
i
can
see,
it
doesn't
attack
the
credibility
of
the
officers
of
general
motors.
it
admits
in
its
reply
brief
that
mr.
sloan
was
credible.
that
means
it
isn't
attacking
his
--
his
credibility
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
attack
anybody
else's.
it
doesn't
attack
anybody's
credibility,
it
just
asks
this
court
to
make
findings
that
everything
they
testified
too
was
wrong
which
is
just
about
the
same
thing
because
no
documents
clearly
require
any
such
conclusion.
but
the
only
time
when
the
general
management
had
participated
in
the
buying
for
general
motors
was
in
the
period
of
--
of
the
general
purchasing
committee,
1923
to
1931.
that
committee
was
composed
of
the
leading
buyers
for
the
general
motors
divisions,
mr.
pratt,
mr.
sloan,
mr.
lyna
who
was
the
executive
secretary
and
one
or
two
other
people
from
the
central
management.
the
government
originally
said
that
that
committee
was
the
heart
of
the
conspiracy.
now,
they
don't
want
to
talk
about
it
at
all.
there,
the
trial
court
made
findings
that
actions
taken
by
the
committee
were
seriously
detrimental
to
du
pont
in
a
number
respects
and
that
it
dealt
with
du
pont
only
in
the
same
manner
as
it
did
with
other
suppliers
and
the
government
doesn't
challenge
that
finding.
now,
the
philosophy
of
that
committee
which
was
headed
by
mr.
sloan
and
pratt,
the
people
of
the
government
says
were
du
pont
representatives,
the
people
who
du
pont
put
into
general
motors,
is
stated
in
the
letter
by
the
secretary,
mr.
lyna
to
a
du
pont
affiliate.
this
isn't
--
this
isn't
something
written
for
the
trial
in
1928.he
says,
“they
were
trying
to
get
some
business.”
and
he
said,
“in
the
making
of
our
purchases,
we
believe
that
each
transaction
sustained
on
its
own
feet
and
its
own
merits.
if
the
quality
of
your
product
and
service
consistently
with
prices
quoted
are
the
best
he
can
obtain,
he
will
buy
it
from
you.”
that
means
the
general
motors
division.
there's
a
contemporary
document
that
general
motors
exhibit
201
to
which
i
referred
you
is
another
example
of
pratt's
speaking
for
the
general
purchasing
committee.
now,
this
committee
headed
by
the
top
general
motors
executive
in
the
period
closest
to
pierre's
presidency
in
general
motors.
in
fact,
it
was
appointed
originally
by
pierre
du
pont.
it
made
strenuous
efforts
to
get
a
competitive
product
for
ducos,
as
soon
as
duco
is
invented
to
make
sure
that
general
motors
would
buy
from
other
corp
companies
as
well
as
du
pont.
it
insisted
upon
a
two-source
of
supply
policy
across
the
board
not
just
for
du
pont,
but
it
wanted
to
make
sure
that
they
would
have
other
sources
of
supplies
in
du
pont
as
well
as
from
other
people,
not
at
that
the
result
of
reducing
du
pont's
sales
although
everything
else
was
equal.
nobody
contended
at
that
time
duco
or
du
pont
products
weren't
as
good
as
the
others
but
they
wanted
to
have
other
sources
of
supply.
importantly,
the
--
this
committee
insisted
and
got
du
pont
to
grant
what
is
called
a
“super
discount,”
a
greater
discount
than
other
people
were
giving,
overall
discount
in
order
to
get
increased
business.
they
weren't
just
allowed
to
meet
somebody
else's
price,
they
had
to
give
a
bigger
discount
to
get
the
business.
that
doesn't
sound
as
if
these
people
were
motivated
by
a
desire
to
favor
du
pont.
now,
this
committee
operating
in
the
field
in
which
--
closest
to
that
in
which
that
mr.
du
pont
was
the
president
of
general
motors,
and
we
don't
deny
that
--
he
control
general
motors
in
a
sense
between
1920
and
1923.
the
judges'
finding
was
that
since
then,
there
hadn't
been
any
control.
this
committee
not
only
didn't
favor
du
pont,
if
the
government
has
completely
given
up
on
the
strong
argument
it
made
in
the
court
below
that
there
was
any
favor
to
them
as
a
result
of
that
committee's
activities.
now,
one
other
fact
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
well,
in
one
sense,
your
honor.
there
wasn't
--
only
in
those
three
years,
mr.
pierre
was
the
president
of
du
pont.
theoretically,
as
president,
he
could
have
made
them
do
what
he
wanted.actually,
the
record
for
those
years
shows
two
things.
first,
all
the
main
steps
he
made
were
in
the
direction
of
getting
out
of
lessening
du
pont's
control
of
general
motors.
secondly,
when
it
came
to
these
purchasing
matters,
he
wrote
letters
indicating
he
was
interested
in
what
--
of
the
amounts
du
pont
sell
to
general
motors,
but
he
kept
his
hands
up.
on
these
two
sources
of
supply
powers,
he
said,
“i
disagree
with
that
policy
but
i
can't
--
i'm
not
going
to
say
you
can't
do
it.”
so
that
--
although
he
was
a
chief
executive,
there
was
no
more
favoritism
in
purchasing
for
general
motors
during
that
period
and
there
wasn't
any
other.
as
to
general
control,
i
can't
say
he
didn't
control
during
that
period.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
his
control
as
chief
executive
ceased
when
mr.
sloan
became
chief
executive
in
1923.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
to
that,
it
certainly,
if
--
if
you
call
what
happened
before
their
control
and
in
the
sense
it
was,
it
ended
at
that
time
and
it's
been
going
--
and
whatever
participation
there
has
been
by
du
pont
and
general
motors,
i
guess
has
been
going
downhill
ever
since,
the
--
well,
let
me
get
into
some
of
these
other
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
oh,
i
see
what
you
mean.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
that's
right.
that's
--
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
well,
they
retained
--
the
voting
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
the
voting
--
the
voting
state
retained
up
to
37%
or
38%
up
to
an
upper
--
a
lot
more
than
23%
of
the
voting
rights.
it
doesn't
appear
that
they
control
the
company
during
that
period.
mr.
sloan
and
his
assistants
controlled
the
company.
that
gets
down
to
these
other
factors.
we
don't
think
that
23%
or
for
that
matter
of
38%
necessarily
controls
the
company.
its
--
its
evidence
from
which
an
inference
can
be
drawn.
but
the
fact,
the
most
important
facts
as
to
whether
one
company
or
one
group
of
people
controls
another
is
--
is,
did
they
control
them
to
--
could
they
make
them
do
what
they
wanted?
i
think
the
government
has
given
up
on
that,
your
honor.
it
doesn't
say
that
du
pont
could
make
--
du
pont
people
could
make
the
general
motors
people
what
do
if
they
wanted,
a
lot
further
back
in
1937.
but
i
had
also
--
supposing
they
control
it
up
to
1937.
this
case
wasn't
brought
to
1949
and
now,
its
1956,
you
find
it
1956.
you
don't
grant
relief
under
the
sherman
act
for
things
which
terminated
at
least
12
years
before
a
suit
was
brought
and
--
and
we
don't
think
there
wasn't
any
control
up
to
that
period.
the
government
stresses
membership
on
the
board
of
directors.
well,
the
trial
judge
found
and
that
this
finding
isn't
challenged
that
mr.
sloan
or
the
president
picked
the
management
members
of
the
directors.
they
were
the
majority
of
the
directors
at
all
times
and
they
were
elected
automatically
after
he
picked
him.
he
didn't
consult
with
anybody
as
to
that.
there
were
five
or
six
du
pont
directors.
there
were
some
outside
directors
as
to
which
everybody
was
consulted
which
everybody
agreed
on,
but
the
trial
judge
found
that
--
that
didn't
show
that
these
outside
directors
were
du
pont
representatives
even
though
du
pont's
like
others
were
consulted
and
sometimes
suggested
who
should
be
named
as
outside
directors.
but
the
government
--
government
also
stresses
du
pont
membership
on
committees.
now,
i
haven't
got
time
to
go
into
that
except
to
say,
and
there's
one
thing
about
the
committees
as
another
thing
about
the
board
and
the
committees
together.
the
operating
committee,
the
only
one
which
would
have
charged
of
purchasing
or
things
of
that
sort
hasn't
had
a
du
pont
on
it
since
1946.
and
for
the
prior
period
when
there
were
two
committees,
it
didn't
have
a
du
pont
under
there
after
1934,
from
1934
to
1937.
but
more
importantly,
neither
the
board
of
directors
nor
any
of
these
committees
so
far
as
the
record
shows,
there
was
anything
to
do
with
purchasing
or
the
types
of
transactions
we're
concerned
with
here.
in
fact
the
record
shows
the
contrary
because
the
affirmative
evidence
was
that
they
didn't
deal
with
any
of
these
things,
and
in
a
corporation
as
big
as
general
motors,
he
wouldn't
expect
the
board
of
directors
to
be
concerned
with
the
kind
of
things
we're
dealing
with
here.
now,
the
one
thing
the
government
lays
great
stress
on
is
the
compensation
plan
system.
the
government
says
that
because
an
original
compensation
plan
in
effect
between
1923
and
1930,
that
was
the
last
date,
gave
the
general
motors
executives
tremendous
amounts
of
money
which
it
did.
they
were
necessarily
loyal
to
du
pont
from
hence
--
form
hence
forward
i
assume.
now,
the
general
motors
compensation
plans
provided
and
remained
except
for
these
two
plans,
one
of
which
expired
in
1930
that
bonuses
are
paid
of
certain
percent
of
the
return
now
to
about
up
to
10,000
of
the
employees
of
general
motors.
now,
what
they
get
depends
upon
how
well
the
company
does,
how
well
their
individual
division
does
and
how
much
they
can
contribute
to
it
individually.
there
isn't
a
shred
of
evidence
to
show
that
any
of
them
were
influenced
or
that
anybody
tried
to
influence
them
by
--
in
relation
to
what
they
did
for
--
for
the
du
pont
company.
the
government
--
in
fact,
the
evidence
shows
that
--
that
these
plans
are
just
a
contrary
effect
as
one
--
one
witness,
mr.
carpenter
of
du
pont
testified.
he
said
it
would
have
just
the
reverse
effect.
these
men
know
that
the
amount
they
get
depends
upon
how
much
general
motors
makes
and
the
du
pont
company
could
go
bankrupt
for
all
the
effect
it
would
have
on
their
compensation.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
well,
i
think
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
well,
let
me
make
two
comments
on
that,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
no.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
they
were
selected
by
a
committee
of
three
men
of
which
mr.
pierre
du
pont
was
chairman.
the
other
two
people
had
nothing
to
do
with
du
pont.
the
record
shows
that
he
selected
that
that
committee
made
a
list
of
people,
a
lot
more
than
a
100
or
80
to
100
who
eventually
got
these
amounts.
it
wasn't
just
a
few
people,
80
to
100.
then,
that
list
was
submitted
to
mr.
sloan
and
he
made
a
lot
of
changes
in
it.
and
the
record
shows
that
no
one
objected
to
any
of
his
changes.
they
were
taken
just
the
way
as
his
nominations
always
were
from
then
on.he
is
at
the
dominations
of
the
heads
of
the
committee.
at
the
present
time
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
well,
he
didn't
determine
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
no,
he
didn't
determine
his
own
compensation.
the
committee,
not
in
determined
the
compensation
of
mr.
sloan
and
some
of
the
other
executives.
now,
they've
been
very
careful
about
that.
that
comes
to
the
other
committee
which
the
government
says
has
control
of
these
bonuses.
that's
now
called
the
bonus
and
salary
committee
and
it
has
had
two
or
three
du
pont
representatives
out
of
five
of
its
members
in
the
last
10
or
15
years
since
it
was
created.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
they
exclude
from
that
committee
all
management
people
who
might
be
eligible
for
bonuses
and
that
--
and
a
large
proportion
of
the
directors
who
are
left
are
du
pont
representatives.
but
more
importantly,
you
may
say,
“well,
that
still
gives
them
control.”
but
the
fact
is,
that
committee
doesn't
look
and
see
it,
tell
to
decide
how
much
each
of
these
10,000
or
more
people
is
going
to
get.
it
just
passes
upon
the
general
program,
possibly
determines
how
it
can
be
allocated
between
the
divisions
of
the
company.
and
the
evidence
affirmatively
is
that
the
amount
recommended
by
the
president
of
the
company
to
that
committee
has
never
been
changed.
now,
that
--
so,
it's
just
fictitious
to
say
that
the
general
motors
people
must
be
in
fear
but
if
they
don't
cartel
to
the
du
ponts,
their
bonuses
are
going
to
be
cut.
that
just
is
imaginary,
it
never
has
happened.
and
the
uncontested
findings
of
the
trial
court,
on
pages
320
and
321,
i
don't
have
time
to
read
them,
hardly
contested
and
partly
uncontested,
support
what
i
have
said.
and
the
part
that
uncontested
is
sufficient
to
show
that
there's
no
evidence
whatever
to
support
the
inference
the
government
wishes
to
draw
and
it's
contrary
to
all
the
testimony.
now
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
well,
i'll
be
glad
to,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
well,
the
government's
case
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
you
have
to
--
the
government's
cases
consist
of
three
elements.
i
think
that
on
their
own
theory,
they've
got
to
prove
at
least
two
of
the
three.
they
seem
to
think
any
two
were
sufficient.
they've
got
to
prove
either
power
and
intent,
that's
one
of
their
theories.
assume
that
mr.
raskob's
statement
was
in
1917
intent
or
they've
got
to
prove
actual
restraint
plus
intent
or
just
actual
restraint
without
intent.
they
might
--
might
not
be
necessary.
we
say
that
if
all
you
have
is
an
intent
in
1917
and
they
haven't
cited
a
thing
to
show
that
intent
after
1917
or
1918
and
mr.
davis
doesn't
mention
anything
else
when
you
asked
him.
but
even
if
you
assume
the
next
couple
of
years
after
that,
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference.
all
the
conduct
from
then
on
shows
that
whatever
mr.
raskob
may
have
intended
in
1917,
that
isn't
--
hasn't
been
any
--
an
intention
for
at
least
25
years.
and
we're
not
dealing
with
a
1917
case
now,
we're
dealing
with
a
1949
case.
secondly,
if
you
assume
an
intention
that
the
du
ponts
all
along
intended,
“we're
going
to
make
general
motors
buy
from
us.
we're
going
to
sell
to
them
everything
we
can
because
of
our
stock
relationship,”
and
nobody
paid
any
attention
to
it
for
35
years.
they
never
sold
any
because
of
that
or
dribble
out
of
a
great
amounts
that
have
been
sold.
we
don't
think
that
would
be
a
restraint
of
trade.
the
reason
that
power
and
intent
together
sometimes
been
said
to
be
illegal,
particularly
under
section
2
of
the
act
is
because
they
lead
to
--
definitely
would
lead
to
a
restraint.
well,
when
you
haven't
had
a
restraint
for
35
years,
to
our
mind,
the
intent
alone
becomes
irrelevant
and
what's
more.
you
can't
have
both
power
and
intent
for
35
years
and
not
have
anything
that
result
from
it.
if
you
had
--
if
you
had
intent
and
no
restraint,
there
couldn't
be
power
because
it
just
wouldn't
work.
and
if
you
had
power
during
that
period
and
there
was
any
restraint,
you
couldn't
have
intent.
so,
you
couldn't
have
the
two
together
and
this
need
--
this
court
has
never
said
and
the
government
doesn't
even
suggest
that
just
an
intention
for
violating
antitrust
laws
or
even
the
just
control
violate
the
antitrust
law.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
concededly,
you
might,
your
honor.
the
record
shows
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
what?
mr.
robert
l.
stern
he
didn't
have
power.
you
had
five
or
six
representatives
on
a
board
of
34.
now,
they
--
whether
they
did
have
any
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
i
--
i
know,
your
honor.
well,
they
might
have
at
first
--
they
conceivably
might
have
if
there
was
no
other
evidence
in
the
record.
we're
talking
about
trade
now.
we're
not
talking
about
everything
across
the
board.
if
there
was
nothing
else
in
the
record
but
23%
of
stock
in
five
or
six
members
of
the
board
enlarged
purchases,
maybe
you
could
infer
what
the
government
wants
you
to
infer.
but
when
you
show
what
the
system
of
purchasing
was
that
it
--
that
it
had
to
--
it
was
done
by
the
buyers
and
then
sellers,
when
it's
admitted
practically
now
that
they
aren't
influenced
at
all.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
they
might
have
had
a
prima
facie
case
if
that's
were
all
this
case
is
and
they
argued
at
least
in
their
briefs,
mr.
davis
has
in
particularly
orally
as
if
all
they
have
to
do
here
is
to
make
out
that
prime
facie
case,
but
of
course
that
isn't
so.
we've
got
findings
if
they
never
did
just
have
to
make
a
prima
facie
case.
and
now,
they've
got
findings
against
them.
they're
going
to
make
out
a
case.
the
judge
was
clearly
erroneous.
and
if
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
well,
that's
right
and
when
--
when
my
answer
isn't
--
that
--
that's
his
suggestion.
i
don't
mean
that's
--
that's
certainly
what
happened.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
well,
it
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
well,
if
it's
inadequacy
of
power,
it
isn't
power.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
i
--
i
assume
when
you
say
inadequacy
of
power
that's
sufficient
for
our
purposes.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
no.
not
--
not
in
all
circumstances
but
when
over
a
long
period
of
years
shows
that
you
--
shows
that
it
doesn't
come
to
completion
and
it's
fervently
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
not
only
can
argue
as
no
intent.
you
can
argue
either
no
intent
or
no
power
but
there
can't
be
both.
now,
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
section
7,
the
--
do
you
want
me
to
go
into
that
your
honor?
i
would
like
to
develop
that
a
little
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
well,
under
section
7,
there
doesn't
have
to
be
intent.there
just
has
to
be
a
reasonable
probability
that
there
will
be
a
restraint.
and
the
trial
judge
found
that
because
there
had
been
no
restraint
for
35
years
that
he
in
his
opinion,
the
government
had
improved
that
there
had
been
or
is
any
reasonable
probability
of
restraint.
and
the
government
admits
frankly
that
because
of
this
35-year
period,
unless
they
can
show
some
restraint,
it
seems
to
me
to
admit
that
they
can't
quite
say
that
that
finding
is
unreasonable.
now,
we
have
two
aspects.
i
think
that's
really
all
there
is
to
the
clayton
act
case
except
i
want
to
add
two
observations.
one
is,
the
government
has
to
prove
both
illegality,
reasonable
probability
between
1917
and
1919.
that's
when
the
restraint
acquisition
occurred
and
that's
what
the
clayton
act
relates
to.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
no.
well,
in
a
normal
case,
that's
the
only
time
when
the
case
is
brought
right
after
the
acquisition
and
they
just
have
to
prove
reasonable
probability
of
restraint
at
the
acquisition.
i
think
when
they
bring
a
case
30
years
later,
they've
also
got
to
show
a
reasonable
likelihood
of
restraint
at
the
time
of
the
case
because
if
it
only
was
reasonable
30
years
ago
and
it
never
happen
afterwards,
it
not
only
is
absurd,
it
doesn't
violate
the
policy
of
the
clayton
act
to
let
this
--
let
this
stock
ownership
continue
when
it
hasn't
had
the
effects
which
were
feared.
they've
got
to
prove
it
for
both
periods
and
the
fact
that
it
didn't
happen
in
between
is
the
strongest
possible
evidence
to
support
a
trial
judge
finding
that
there
wasn't
any
reasonable
probability
of
what's
happening
in
the
future,
certainly,
beginning
in
1949
after
there
hasn't
been
any
restraint
for
many
years.
now,
one
other
observation
which
applies
both
to
the
sherman
act
and
the
clayton
act,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
at
one
time,
“all
we're
concerned
with
is
the
comparison
of
figures
in
the
automobile
industry.”
i
haven't
got
time
to
go
into
it
but
in
our
brief
we
argue
that
since
we're
concerned
here
with
fabrics
and
finishes
paint
which
is
sold
the
same
kind
of
fabrics
and
finishes,
the
record
shows,
are
sold
widely
outside
of
the
automobile
industry,
not
only
--
general
motors
is
a
very
tiny,
if
i
might
use
the
word
“tiny”
2%
to
4%
portion
of
the
market
for
those
products.
and
so,
i
don't
think
the
comparison
from
purpose
of
the
market
is
just
the
automobile
industry.
it
isn't
if
you're
dealing
with
engines
or
tires,
but
you
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
that's
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
but
what
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
i
wasn't
invoking
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
i
wasn't
invoking
the
cellophane
case,
your
honor.
i
was
thinking
more
of
cases
like
the
columbia
steel
case.
this
is
a
--
this
is
something
less
than
a
vertical
integration.
it's
23%
instead
of
a
100%.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
and
here,
you
look
at
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
the
small
--
the
small
percentage
of
the
market
shows
there's
no
impairment
of
competition.
now,
we've
developed
i
--
mr.
robert
l.
stern
a
lot
of
paint.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
the
volume
of
sales
of
that
kind
of
fabrics,
the
market,
the
size
of
the
market.
you
look
and
see
what
percent
--
there
isn't
any
impairment
of
competition
if
the
proportion
was
small
enough
even
--
even
if
the
absolute
figures
are
large.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
of
the
market
for
this
--
no,
not
the
whole
fabric,
the
market
for
this
kinds
of
fabric.
mr.
robert
l.
stern
that's
right.
if
the
same
kind
of
thing
is
sold
outside
the
motor
industry
and
the
record
shows
they
are.
well,
i
--
i
don't
want
to
spend
anymore
time
on
that.
oh,
i
do
want
to
say
one
thing
about
the
yellow
cab
case
which
is
the
only
case
which
is
really
at
all
close
to
this
on
its
facts
and
i'm
not
going
to
talk
about
the
majority
opinion,
which
obviously
support
us
but
the
dissenting
opinion.
the
dissenting
opinion
of
justices'
black
and
reed
in
the
second
yellow
cab
case
stated
that
the
trial
judge,
his
findings
were
not
sufficient
because
he
had
not
found
that
the
freedom
of
the
cab
companies
to
buy
from
the
manufacturing
company
had
not
been
restrained.
that
finding
was
lacking
in
that
case.
that
finding
is
made
over
and
over
again
in
the
findings
in
this
case.
and
the
record
plainly
shows
that
the
freedom
of
general
motors
to
buy
as
it
will
has
not
been
restrained.
for
that
reason
and
for
lot
of
others,
we
think
this
case
is
a
much
simpler
case
than
the
yellow
cab
case
among
others
because
there,
the
company
owns
62%
of
the
stock
of
the
--
of
the
subsidiary
company,
which
obviously
was
control
and
still
wasn't
held
to
be
illegal.
they
bought
100%
of
their
supplies
from
it,
still
wasn't
held
to
be
illegal.
i
haven't
covered
everything
i
wanted
to
any
more
than
mr.
cox
says,
your
honor.
i
hope
that
you
will
--
i
hope
that
you
will
read
these
long
briefs
and
find
out
the
rest
of
what
we
would
have
liked
to
say.
