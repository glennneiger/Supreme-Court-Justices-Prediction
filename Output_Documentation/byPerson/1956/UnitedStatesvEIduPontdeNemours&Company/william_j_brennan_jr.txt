justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
was
wondering
if
you're
suggesting
this.
that
the
relationship
is
one
by
reason
of
which
general
motors
would
not
think
ordinarily
of
buying
from
someone
else
what
can
be
purchased
from
du
pont,
not
because
under
any
instructions
only
to
buy
from
du
pont
but
because
of
the
situation
between
the
two
companies,
the
ordinary
impulse
would
be
to
get
from
du
pont
what
can
be
purchased
from
du
pont.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
that's
the
minimum,
are
you
suggesting
that
if
the
record
supports
that
much
then
necessarily
not
a
conspiracy
for
combination
in
the
sense
intended
by
the
statute
has
been
true
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
which
has
held
as
the
consequences
which
you
suggest
it
does
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now
then
you
are
going
beyond
to
suggest
to
us
that
government
doesn't
establish
a
case
without
also
establishing
intent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
are
you
reading
from?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
will
there
be
anything
else
that
you
rest
tonight?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
all
that
you
have
as
to
intent
otherwise
is
the
subsequent
conduct?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
i
gather
also,
mr.
davis,
that
if
this
in
combination
with
the
conduct
doesn't
support
a
finding
of
intent
then
the
government's
case
fails?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there's
nothing
--
i
take
it
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
shows
any
over
direction
that
you
do
by
du
pont,
there's
nothing
in
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
subsidiary
of
general
motors?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
the
subtle
way
of
saying
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
fabrics
field,
mr.
davis,
did
you
say
that
there
are
woven
fabrics
which
compete
with
the
du
pont
fabric
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at,
whether
--
was
whether
there
had
been
any
decline
in
the
purchases
of
the
du
pont
type
of
fabric
with
the
introduction
of
these
newer
types
of
fabric.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
understand
you,
mr.
davis,
is
there
any
evidence
that
the
letters
that
you
referred
to
ever
got
past
the
recipients
down
further
along
the
line
of
the
organization?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
the
thought
occurs
when
you
mentioned
that
these
--
the
purchasing
agents
and
other
witnesses,
who
i
gather
have
directly
in
hand
the
purchases
that
--
that
are
made
on
behalf
of
general
motors.
you
thought
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
they
said
that
they
were
not
influenced
in
any
wise
by
the
relationship
of
du
pont
in
making
their
purchases?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
that
the
--
the
letters
that
you
mentioned
too,
i
suppose
they
would
say
had
no
bearing
on
that
decision.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
comes
out,
i
gather,
at
the
volume.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
should
have
given
some
volume?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
cox
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
figure
for
over
all
paint
sales?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
is
the
$30
million
figure?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
the
$30
million,
only
that
type
of
paint
you
describe
first
just
before
recess?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
is
there
any
product
93%
of
the
sales
of
which
are
sold
to
general
motors?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
give
me
those
two
figures
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
one
to
general
motors
and
the
one
to
other
automobile.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
give
me
that
same
thing
in
dollar
figure?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
mr.
cox,
personally,
it's
important
to
me
whether
it's
93%
of
aggregate
volume
of
$500
of
sales
or
an
aggregate
volume
of
$12
million
of
sales.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
give
us
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
cox,
is
there
any
evidence
whether
or
not
in
the
cases
of
the
decision
in
a
division
as
i
understand
it,
it
makes
its
own
of
what
finish
to
specify?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
any
testimony
whether
or
not
those
decisions
were
arrived
at
after
comparative
tests
of
the
available
finishes?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
--
what
is
evidence
in
that
regard?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
does
the
evidence
go
so
far
as
to
show
that
in
fact
the
specification
of
duco
by
those
divisions
which
did
specify
it
was
made
after
a
consideration
of
these
other
available
finishes?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
say
this
was
a
witness
from
the
staff
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
was
there
any
--
any
testimony
from
the
operating
divisions
who
testified?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
a
finding
incidentally?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
--
is
that
one
of
the
challenged
or
not
of
the
finding.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
those
divisions
which
now
use
other
finishes
or
they
did
they
at
any
time
used
duco?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
while
you're
at
the
antifreeze,
you're
going
to
treat
of
this
kentucky
alcohol
company?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me
mr.
cox,
will
you
and
mr.
stern
discuss
the
tetraethyl
that's
alleged?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
say
record
of
--
record
300
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
say
mr.
davis
that
at
least
the
evidence
here,
i
don't
want
you
to
repeat
what
you
said
earlier,
i
was
getting
that
one
too,
that
there
was
someone
else
at
the
time
equally
qualified
to
do
the
job
that
du
pont
did
in
this
connection?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
wasn't
much
for
chemical
industry
at
that
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
there
were
large
--
other
large
chemical
manufacturing
then
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
comparable
in
size.
