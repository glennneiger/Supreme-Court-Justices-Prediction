justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
at
this
point
ask
to
be
declared
(inaudible)
right
in
thinking
that
you
--
are
you
attacking
some
findings,
not
--
not
because
the
evidence
--
you're
attacking
some
findings
simply
because
the
evidence
has
been
sustained,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
by
that
the
inferences
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
decided
to
draw?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was
hoping
you
would
tell
me
that
all
i
have
to
do
is
to
read
the
findings
(inaudible)
conclusions
that
i
gathered
from
what
you've
said
that
one
really
has
to
go
through
that
letter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
say?
and
never
mind
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
hearing
your
misinterpretation,
what
do
you
say
on
that
point?
how
much
of
this
record
do
you
think
i
actually
read
and
perhaps
to
render
a
traditional
judgment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
trying
to
tell
things
with
time,
which
--
which
findings
are
rather
--
are
self-destructive.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
i
don't
--
if
i
don't
find
the
government
with
such
a
finding
and
i
do
have
to
go
to
this
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mind
telling
us
what
you
think?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
--
do
you
and
the
appellees
agree
on
the
pages
which
(inaudible)
or
do
you
refer
to
different
pages?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
read
all
pages,
i
don't
have
to
read
all
of
it.
so,
i
don't
read
--
i
mean
his
pages,
i
don't
have
to
read
all
of
it
either,
but
they
happen
to
be
different
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
davis,
may
i
ask
you
without
interrupting
the
flow
of
your
argument
whether
there
was
any
difference
in
the
purchases
from
du
pont
at
--
between
these
in
respect
to
the
period
when
they
held
on
22%
of
the
stock
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
knew
you
were
coming
to
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
at
the
moment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(inaudible)
it
is
significant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
davis,
did
the
district
court
give
its
criteria
or
criterion
for
determining
what
constitutes
the
code?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
aren't
you
--
you've
--
you've
indicated
to
me
at
least
that
--
that
you
think
argumentation,
discussion
about
the
concept
to
control
is
a
confusing
factor
in
this
--
as
a
factor
in
the
equation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
going
to
talk
about
control
as
such,
using
that's
an
irrelevant
discussion
and
confusing
the
term,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
indicated
the
rule
earlier
that
the
dominant
--
you
gave
me
the
impression.
the
dominant
fact
in
the
situation
as
you
organize
it
is
that
general
motors
should
be
predisposed
that
just
to
the
human
fact
they
would
be
predisposed
in
favor
of
du
pont
as
against
other
sellers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
that
is
so,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
control
because
that
predisposition
isn't
due
to
--
is
derived
from
buyers
rather
than
pressure
from
the
sellers,
if
--
if
you
can
separate
the
two
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it
--
it
derives
in
the
relationship
of
the
parties
not
because
one
can
exert
some
authority.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
say
if
--
if
exertion
of
authority
is
involved,
then
you
do
have
control
or
part
of
the
control.
if
you
mean
the
natural
predisposition
of
people
who
are
linked
together
to
favor
their
friends,
that's
a
different
story.
justice
felix
frankfurter
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
--
in
the
holding
company
act,
one
does
--
one
does
have
to
be
considered
with
the
concept
control,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
i'm
not
suggesting.
i'm
saying
--
i'm
talking
about
the
idea
with
which
i
have
to
wrestle.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
holding
company
act,
i
have
to
wrestle
with
the
idea
of
control.
that's
in
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
what
sense?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
by
--
you
mean
by
combination,
i'm
not
talking
about
the
combination
in
history
isn't
enough
to
have
a
combination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
must
be
in
restraint
of
trade.
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
combination.
do
you
mean
anymore
to
that
conscious
joinder
of
action?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
consensual.
i
mean
two
people
acting
and
both
knowing
that
they're
acting
rather
than
somebody
being
in
a
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
against
conspiracy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
people
knowing
what
they're
about,
acting
together.
is
there
any
more
than
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
congress
used
different
terms
and
i
should
myself
find
there's
nothing
difficult
to
think
a
combination
is
not
--
is
not
a
means
of
conspiracy
nor
synonymous
with
a
contract.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
supposes
your
record
actual
does
in
fact
as
between
had
bid
done
on
general
motors
had
a
bid
done
(inaudible)
they
needed.
and
in
fact
so
far
as
the
record
shows
the
quality
of
the
goods
to
the
various
bidders
was
equal
and
in
fact
a
more
or
less
(inaudible)
higher
bid
of
the
du
pont
against
xyz
suppose
we
have
that
in
the
record
or
will
pressing
around
that
he
loses
his
real
intent?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
not
saying
--
i'm
not
saying
if
you
haven't
got
it,
you
haven't
got
intent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
saying
is
that
--
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
prove
restraint
you
need
to
worry
about
intent.
if
you
don't
prove
restraint,
i
mean,
de
facto,
then
--
then
you've
got
a
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
you
haven't
got
in
this
a
problem
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
good
answer
but
you
even
got
a
different
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
merely
suggesting
that
the
subject
for
this
thing
called
intent,
it
isn't
mens
rea
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
on
the
brink
of
(inaudible)
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
--
suppose
one
could
say
unequivocally
that
the
record
show
this
last
thing
you
mentioned
that
there
was
no
difference
overwhelming
the
extent
there
was
no
difference
between
du
pont
and
other
suppliers
of
general
motors.
suppose
in
the
record
there
wasn't
a
--
applied
things
to
contradict
that
conclusion,
would
you
say
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
nevertheless,
that's
immaterial
because
the
--
in
view
of
the
relationship
of
the
parties
that
the
restraint,
inherent?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
unless
that
if
you
actually
had
52%
ownership,
then
--
then
your
--
talk
about
control
we
had
some
(inaudible)
there,
wouldn't
it?
i
don't
mean
to
say
it
hasn't
now,
but
have
we?
then
you
--
you
could
really
stand
here
and
argue
that
the
mere
fact
that
they
didn't
exercise
the
title
of
power
before
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
unless,
you
got
a
combination?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
you
started
out
with
that
the
mere
ownership
of
stock.
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
corporation
and
another,
no
matter
how
(inaudible)
the
ownership.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
even
though
you
had
interlocking
directors?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
won't
have
a
problem
under
the
clayton
act,
anybody?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
knew
that
the
findings
as
yet
i
don't
really
have
to
(inaudible)
what
did
the
district
court
say
about
that
if
any?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
didn't
to
the
question,
the
accuracy
of
your
findings.
and
i
wondered
if
the
district
court
thought
about
the
relevant
facts
to
deal
with.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
you
said
not
only
this
--
not
only
did
they
sell
this
5%
of
--
of
these
lead
outputs
to
the
general
motors.
but
you
--
i
think
i
heard
you
say,
they
tried
to
sell
them
to
others?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
was
that
there
was
something
in
the
situation
that
disabled
them
from
getting
that
market
but
they
did
get
the
market
in
which
they
had
this
relationship?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
in
any
of
the
record
during
the
case
that
there
were
in
fact
other
chemicals
concerned
equally
well
equipped
to
use
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
nobody
including
du
pont
could
use
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
anybody
else
equally
equipped
to
learn
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i'm
--
i'm
not
--
i
was
just
wondering
(inaudible)
the
record
about
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
taking
enough
time
to
summarize
what
--
they
have
escaped
my
ear.
what
--
there
is
on
your
third
point,
the
restraint
other
than
the
overwhelming
percentage
of
flow
of
business
from
du
pont
to
general
motors
and
the
duco
thing
that
you
just
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
doing
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
think
they
bear
upon
your
statement.
they
bear
on
your
first
and
second
line
of
the
fact,
more
than
on
the
third.
that
they
--
if
i
understand
by
restraint
that
the
actuality
of
exercise
of
companies
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
to
the
other.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
important
part
that
if
nothing
happened
and
it's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down,
may
i
trouble
you
with
one
more
question,
mr.
davis.
in
your
appendix
if
that's
what
it's
called
that
if
you
put
your
fingers
(inaudible)
you've
underscored
the
importance
of
the
findings
with
which
you
disagree.
what
i
would
like
to
know
is
this.
is
there
any
complaint
by
you
that
the
district
court
left
out
the
--
i'm
not
talking
about
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
rightness
or
the
wrongness,
left
out
the
matter
he
should
have
stated
which
would
bear
on
the
truth?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
--
but
he
have
them
in
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
wonder
whether
--
whether
it
isn't
merely
--
whether
you
affirmatively,
erroneously
from
you
point
of
view
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
sound
but
what
he
failed
to
find
because
he
didn't
fairly
state
what
the
record
caused
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
tried
to
get
his
license
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
call
attention
to
them
as
--
as
vitiated
and
thinking
that
it's
mutilating
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
to
paint,
as
to
auto
paint.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
cox,
may
i
trouble
you
before
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
answer
justice
black's
question
in
this
larger
import.
paint
--
speaking
of
figure,
whatever
it
is,
90%
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
part
of
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap).
you've
also
told
us
that
the
sum
total,
i
think
there's
agreement.
the
total
sales
of
du
pont
to
the
general
motors
is
$30
million.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
means
18
million
to
be
accountable.
could
you,
without
too
much
trouble,
tell
us
the
percentage
of
sales
of
the
other
commodities
included
in
those
18
with
general
motors
as
compared
with
other
buyers.
did
i
put
my
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
make
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
thought
our
basic
comparison
must
be
in
the
automotive
industry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
stern?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
gather,
justice
reed
suggest
that
there
might
have
been
resistance,
a
successful
resistance
if
you
will
by
general
voters
to
a
desire
as
a
part
of
--
of
du
pont
then
sell
those
combinations
to
many
--
several
people
involved,
and
that's
your
proposition.
to
themselves
that
that
it
--
it
will
have
desire
and
exerted
as
much
power
as
they
could
but
were
blocked
by
general
motors.
that
wouldn't
be
your
(inaudible)
but
what
mr.
justice
asked.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
they
can
with
their
power
or
intent
on
the
power
that
that
exclude
all
ineffective
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
other
term
for
ineffective
accomplishments
of
the
intent
because
of
its
inadequacy
of
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
would
mean
you
must
have
completion
of
this
prohibited
desire
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
argue
there's
no
intent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
function
of
the
market
is
a
very
different
one
from
the
function
of
the
market
in
cases
of
last
year.
this
is
a
different
market
function
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
within
this
--
within
this
industry
through
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
possibly
the
power
and
intent
that
existed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
the
preferential
treatment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
smallness
of
it,
that
seems
to
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand.
if
you
are
--
suppose
general
motors
and
chrysler
and
in
fact
they
called
it
their
stock
relationship,
general
motors
was
persuaded
to
buy
from
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
understand
you
to
say
you
must
compare
the
volume
of
the
sales
with
the
volume
of
the
sales
of
fabrics
generally?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
if
--
if
the
record
would
show
that
but
for
their
stock
control,
general
motors
would
import
from
some
competitors
of
du
pont.
it
becomes
relevant
to
show
that
this
--
that
this
is
only
2%
or
3%
of
the
whole
fabric
market.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
not
in
the
motor
industry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
stock
relation
between
standard
oil
and
either
general
--
ethyl
or
general
motors
and
du
pont?
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
either
of
these.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
just
stating
a
word,
what
inference
you
draw
from
the
fact
that
there
was
no
other?
what
is
the
inference
from
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
at
this
time,
nobody
knew
this
and
that
there
was
no
--
it
wasn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
chemical
organization
that
would
have
done
this.
and
what
--
i
don't
quite
get
the
inference
of
your
emphasis
that
nobody
knew
anything
about
it
and
du
pont
went
ahead.
what
is
the
inference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
much
inference
from
that.
at
least
there
is
an
inference
they
did
go
ahead
what
they
were
enterprising.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
others
didn't
stop
and
they
did
have
certain
--
certain
--
what
is
called
good
will
i
suppose,
and
the
past
performance
is
incorrect.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
this
was
a
dangerous
business,
the
chemicals
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
the
fact
that
you
get
what
--
you
don't
see
what
confidence
you
get,
because
that's
my
point.
