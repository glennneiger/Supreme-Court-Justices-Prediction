mr.
john
f.
davis
if
the
court
please.
this
is
a
civil
antitrust
suit
bought
--
brought
by
the
united
states
against
e.i.
du
pont
de
nemours
&
company,
general
motors
corporation
and
others,
but
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
under
both
the
sherman
act
and
the
clayton
act.
the
original
complaint
was
extensively
amended
in
court
trial
and
the
issues
which
i
before
this
court
on
appeal,
considerably
narrower
in
the
issues
which
were
before
the
trial
court.
at
the
present
time,
the
gravamen
of
the
case
is
that
the
intercorporate
relationships
between
the
du
pont
company
and
the
general
motors
corporation,
constitute
a
combination,
a
combination
which
is
in
restraint
of
trade
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
is
a
combination
to
monopolize
under
section
2
of
the
sherman
act,
and
it
is
acquisition
start
which
may
result
in
restraints
or
monopolization
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
this
case
went
to
trial
before
judge
walter
j.
lebay
in
november
of
1952.
it
took
about
six
months
in
to
trial
and
the
trial
was
concluded
in
june
of
1953.
a
recent
oral
argument
was
submitted
in
november
of
1953,
november
or
december.
and
one
year
later,
judge
lebay's
decision
which
he
later
adopted
as
his
findings
of
fact
in
conclusions
of
law
was
issued.
that
case
filed
against
the
government
on
all
of
the
issues
and
the
cases
are
here
on
direct
appeal
from
the
district
court.
now,
in
view
of
the
volume
of
the
documents
in
this
case,
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
in
few
minutes
that
i
have
to
given
an
indication
of
what
they
are.
the
present
record,
which
i
didn't
bring
up
to
the
table
with
me
this
evening,
consists
of
10
large
volumes.
then,
the
government's
brief
is
the
large,
great
volume,
and
i
would
like
to
call
your
honors'
attention
to
an
appendix
which
we
have
in
this
brief,
commencing
at
page
150,
because
it
maybe
useful
during
the
argument
to
be
able
to
turn
to
this
list
of
the
people
who
are
involved
in
the
case.
we
have
listed
alphabetically
the
names
of
various
individuals
who
play
an
important
part
in
the
story
and
have
indicated
what
their
connection
was
with
the
two
main
corporations,
the
du
pont
corporation
and
general
motors
corporations.
for
example,
at
the
top
of
page
152,
we
find
the
name
of
mr.
pierre
s.
du
pont,
who
is
probably
the
primary
actor
in
the
early
stages
of
this
--
of
this
case.
and
we
found
under
his
name
his
connection
for
the
du
pont
corporation
and
the
general
motors
corporation.
on
the
preceding
pages,
we
find
his
two
brothers,
mr.
irenee
du
pont
and
mr.
lammot
du
pont
with
that
connection.
and
similarly,
they
are
listed,
mr.
john
j.
raskob,
who
was
the
treasurer
of
the
du
pont
corporation,
mr.
durant,
who
was
the
founder
of
general
motors
and
mr.
--
mr.
alfred
p.
sloan,
who
was
a
very
important
figure
in
--
in
the
story.
there
is
a
great
volume
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
when
the
court
rose
yesterday
afternoon,
i
was
just
about
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
a
reprint
of
the
opinion
and
judgment
of
the
district
court,
which
appears
in
a
grey
bound
volume,
about
the
size
of
our
brief.
it's
an
--
somewhat
unusual
procedure
to
reprint
the
findings
of
the
court
below.
but
in
this
case
--
outside
of
the
record,
but
in
this
case,
there
appears
to
be
some
dispute
between
the
appellees
and
the
government
as
to
just
which
sections
of
this
opinion
we
are
attacking
and
if
there
is
anything
that
this
court
is
entitled
to
know
precisely,
it
is
what
part
of
those
findings
we
are
attacking.
so,
we
have
reprinted
the
opinion
of
the
court
below,
underscoring
the
--
anything
in
the
opinion,
which
we
ask
this
court
to
--
to
overturn.
on
the
first
page
of
the
opinion,
we
have
listed
the
pages
where
the
underscoring
appears,
so
that
it
is
easy
to
find
the
particular
provisions,
which
are
subject
to
attack
here.
mr.
john
f.
davis
we
are
attacking,
i
think,
none
of
the
basic
findings.
i
think
we've
--
we
--
and
i
think
it's
safe
to
say
we're
attacking
the
conclusions,
not
legal
conclusions,
but
the
--
the
second
step,
the
conclusions
which
are
based
on
the
findings
of
fact.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
inferences
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
inferences
which
ought
to
be
drawn
from
the
specific
facts.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
i
--
i
don't
know
what
i
said,
i
think
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
depends
how
far
you
go
along
with
me,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
there
are
--
that
on
the
facts,
which
are
found
in
this
document,
in
this
document
alone,
this
court
should
reach
the
opposite
conclusion
from
that
which
the
court
found.
if
however,
their
question
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
i
will
do
that.
that
--
in
fact,
that
is
the
--
that's
the
burden
of
my
argument.
there's
verbal
law
to
argue
in
this
case.
it's
almost
all
the
question
of
--
of
analyzing
these
facts
and
seeing
where
--
when
it
comes
out.
mr.
john
f.
davis
however,
in
order
to
make
the
statements
of
the
facts
meaningful
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
you
don't
have
to
go
through
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
this
is
--
this
is
what
--
where
you'll
find
--
if
--
if
you
cannot
go
along
with
me
on
my
primary
proposition
that
these
facts
support
opposition
then
you're
part
way
along
the
line
because
there
are
conceded,
certain
basic
facts.
we
stop
halfway
up
the
mount
in
anyway,
there's
no
question
as
to
those.
now
then,
the
question
comes,
where
do
you
go
from
there?
and
i
think
that
the
briefs
in
this
case
are
thorough
enough
and
make
sufficient
references
to
the
record
so
that
you
have
a
guide
to
the
record
and
don't
have
to
start
in
reading
at
page
one
and
read
the
record
through
like
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
am
sure
we'll
refer
you
to
different
pages.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
shall
--
i
shall
try
and
persuade
you
that
--
save
you
the
task
of
reading
some
of
the
pages
they
refer
to,
because
i
think
they're
immaterial
to
the
decision
in
the
case.
i
think
that
these
facts,
which
i
am
about
to
--
to
recite
will
be
more
meaningful
if
i
very
broadly
summarize
the
nature
of
the
government's
case,
so
that
you'll
know
why
i'm
--
i'm
reciting
some
of
these
facts.
we
are
not
here
arguing
that
it
is
improper
for
a
corporation
to
buy
control
of
another
corporation,
nor
are
we
arguing
that
it
is
improper
for
one
corporation
to
carry
on
business
transactions
with
another
corporation
in
which
it
has
a
stock
interest.
but
we
do
assert
that
a
combination,
in
restraint
of
trade,
is
not
less
illegal
because
it
is
effectuated
through
a
stock
relationship.
specifically,
it
is
the
government's
claim
that
the
du
pont
corporation
formed
a
combination
with
the
general
motors
company
corporation
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
a
non-competitive
advantage
over
its
competitors
in
selling
material
to
the
general
motors
corporation
and
in
developing
chemical
discoveries
made
by
general
motors.
now,
in
this
case,
the
combination
took
the
form
of
infiltrating
the
general
motors
management
from
the
top.
in
the
first
place,
du
pont
bought
--
bought
23%
of
the
general
motors
stock.
mr.
john
f.
davis
by
du
pont,
i
mean,
the
e.i.
du
pont
de
nemours
&
company.
i
mean
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i
mean
the
corporation.
mr.
john
f.
davis
whenever
i
--
i
shall
try,
whenever
i
--
it's
--
it's
a
little
awkward
to
use
the
entire
corporate
name.
and
i
would
like
it
understood
when
i
say
du
pont,
i
--
i
refer
to
the
corporation.
when
i
refer
to
an
individual,
i
will
try
to
refer
to
him
by
his
entire
name.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
will
have
occasion
to
refer
to
mr.
irenee
du
pont,
mr.
lammot
du
pont
and
mr.
pierre
du
pont.
but
i
shall
try
to
give
their
names
when
i'll
name
them
individually.
or
i
may
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
that
i
think
is
not
before
the
court
at
the
present
time.
the
original
complaint
charged
the
conspiracy
among
the
du
pont's,
the
individual
du
ponts,
to
bring
together
general
motors,
the
du
pont
corporation,
united
states
rubber
in
a
combination
whereby
they
would
be
captured
markets
between
the
three.
it
was
necessary
in
order
to
prove
that
case,
to
prove
a
conspiracy
because
there
was
no
single
corporate
head
that
came
up
to
the
individual
du
pont.
we
have
not
brought
before
this
court
on
appeal
the
question
of
--
of
that
conspiracy.
the
only
question
before
the
court
now
is
the
combination
between
the
du
pont
corporation
and
general
motors.
and
in
that
case
you
don't
--
the
individual
du
ponts
are
no
longer
defendants.
they're
not
appellees
here.
du
pont
bought
23%
of
general
motors
stock.
it
installed
its
own
representatives
from
the
board
of
directors
and
on
the
managing
committees,
secured
the
--
the
loyalty
of
the
executives
from
the
general
motors
corporation.
and
since
that
time
it
has
enjoyed
a
tremendous
volume
of
trade,
selling
its
products
to
general
motors,
developing
general
motors'
chemical
discoveries.
as
i
just
explained
to
--
to
mr.
justice
reed,
here,
we
are
not
--
we
are
not
talking
about
a
conspiracy
as
such.
that
was
as
an
important
factor
in
the
court
below,
but
it
has
been
narrowed,
so
that
it's
no
longer
necessary
to
go
into
the
conspiracy
angle
of
it.
now,
it
is
sufficient,
we
believe,
to
sustain
the
government's
case,
to
sustain
that
this
stock
relationship
between
the
du
pont
corporation
and
general
motors
is
--
is
a
combination
which
exercises
an
influence
by
nature
of
--
of
the
stock
ownership,
whereby,
trade
which
would
ordinarily
go
to
this
firm
and
that
firm
on
basis
of
free
competition
is
now
channeled
to
the
du
pont
corporation
itself.
this
does
not
occur
because
there
are
specific
instructions
that
the
trade
should
go
then.
it
may
not
happen
all
the
time,
but
it
happens
a
great
deal
of
the
time
and
sufficient
of
the
trade
has
been
channeled
to
du
pont,
so
that
we
believe
there
has
been
a
material
restraint
on
commerce.
we
are
dealing
here
with
--
with
giants
in
the
american
corporate
field.
general
motors
last
year,
had
gross
sales
of
$12,000,000,000.
they
had
a
net
profit
of
over
$1,000,000,000
and
the
dividends
that
flowed
to
du
pont
amounted
to
a
$135,000,000.
du
pont,
on
the
other
hand,
is
the
largest
of
the
american
chemical
corporations.
it
had
sales
last
year
of
nearly
$2,000,000,000
and
profits
of
about
$431,000,000.
the
magnitude
of
these
corporations
is
relevant
in
an
antitrust
case.
not
because
size
by
itself
is
--
is
illegal,
but
because
size
carries
with
it
the
potentiality
of
--
of
abuse.
i
like
the
quotation
from
colepeper
back
in
1640
in
the
debate
on
the
british
monopoly
law,
where
he
said,
“these
men,
like
the
frogs
of
egypt,
have
got
possession
of
our
dwellings
and
we
have
scarce
a
room
free
from
them.
they
sup
in
our
cup,
they
dip
in
our
dish.
they
sit
by
our
fire.”
now,
there's
one
more
point
i
would
like
to
make
before
i
turn
to
the
facts.
there
occur
--
there
reoccurs
throughout
the
briefs
of
the
appellees,
the
suggestion
that
this
course
of
business
or
that
course
of
business,
did
not
hurt
general
motors
or
was
for
the
general
benefit
of
general
motors.
now,
i
want
to
be
clear
that
i
am
not
arguing
that
anything
that
was
done
in
this
situation
has
hurt
general
motors.
we
are
not
concerned
with
--
with
whether
or
not
general
motors
prospered
in
spite
of
or
because
of
this
combination.
we
are
concerned
here
with
whether
or
not
there
has
been
free
competition.
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
said
that,
“the
rule
of
our
economic
life
shall
be
an
absence
of
restraints
on
trade.”
and
we
are
concerned
here
not
with
the
welfare
of
--
of
general
motors
or
du
pont
but
with
whether
or
not
this
is
consistent
with
the
--
the
antitrust
policy
which
has
been
established
by
congress.
in
discussing
the
facts,
i
--
i
shall
try
to
divide
them
into
three
parts.
in
the
first
place,
i
shall
discuss
the
evidence
which
deals
with
whether
or
not
du
pont
acquired
control
of
general
motors.
in
the
second
part,
i
shall
discuss
whether
or
not
they
had
an
intent
to
restrain
trade
when
they
made
their
investment
in
general
motors.
and
in
the
third
part,
i
shall
discuss
whether
or
not,
this
preference
in
the
trade
has
in
fact
materialized.
this
case
started
back
in
december
of
1917.
at
that
time,
the
du
pont
corporation
had
accumulated
very
large
earnings
from
its
munitions
business
during
world
war
i.
the
question
arose
whether
these
earnings
should
be
distributed
to
the
stockholders
or
whether
they
should
be
retained
in
the
corporation
in
order
that
the
corporation
might
maintain
its
--
its
earnings.
now,
at
this
time
there
were
some
in
the
management
of
--
of
the
du
pont
corporation
who
were
personally
interested
in
general
motors.
principally,
there
was
mr.
john
j.
raskob.
he
was
the
treasurer
of
the
du
pont
corporation,
and
mr.
pierre
s.
du
pont,
who
was
at
that
time
president
of
the
du
pont
corporation.
they
had
personal
investments
in
general
motors.
the
president
of
general
motors
at
this
time
was
mr.
william
c.
durant.
mr.
durant
had
put
the
company
together
back
in
1908,
and
after
some
problems
with
his
bankers,
he
was
back
in
control
of
the
company
in
1917.
mr.
durant
suggested
to
mr.
raskob
and
mr.
pierre
s.
du
pont
that
the
du
pont
corporation
or
the
du
pont,
he
wasn't
too
specific
about
it,
form
a
partnership
with
mr.
durant
to
control
general
motors.
his
thought
was
that
he,
mr.
durant,
would
remain
responsible
for
the
financial
affairs
of
the
corporation,
and
that
the
du
ponts
should
take
over
the
financial
responsibility.
it
was
contemplated
that
du
pont
would
invest
in
the
neighborhood
of
$25,000,000
in
the
stock
of
general
motors.
that
was
made
explicitly
clear,
that
between
them,
mr.
durant
and
mr.
du
pont
should
--
and
the
--
and
the
du
pont
company
would
control
general
motors.
i
say
this
because
we
have,
as
a
primary
exhibit
in
this
case,
exhibit
--
government
exhibit
124,
the
material
portions,
which
for
this
purpose
are
reprinted
at
page
9
and
10
of
our
brief.
mr.
raskob,
after
hearing
mr.
durant's
proposal,
prepared
a
memorandum
summarizing
the
proposal
and
the
effects
of
the
purchases,
in
order
to
lay
this
proposition
before
the
governing
committees
of
the
du
pont
corporation,
the
finance
committee
and
the
executive
committee.
in
this
memorandum,
he
summarized
--
i
appointed
--
printed
in
our
brief
the
--
the
summary
of
the
--
of
the
reasons
for
purchasing
it.
on
page
9
he
says,
“summarizing
the
above,
we
have
an
opportunity
to
make
a
substantial
investment
in
the
motor
industry
with
the
following
points
in
favor
thereof.
one,
with
mr.
durant,
we
will
have
joint
control
of
the
companies.
two,
we
are
immediately
to
assume
charge
and
be
responsible
for
the
financial
operation
of
the
company."
skipping
through
to
page
10,
about
halfway
down
where
it
speaks
of
management.
"perhaps
it
is
not
made
clear
that
the
directorates
of
the
motor
companies
will
be
chosen
by
du
pont
and
durant.
mr.
durant
would
be
continued
as
the
president
of
the
company.
mr.
p.
s.
du
pont
would
be
continued
as
chairman
of
the
board,
the
finance
committee
will
be
ours",
and
by
ours,
he
means
du
pont
because
he's
addressing
this
to
the
du
pont
committee."
the
finance
committee
will
be
ours
and
we
will
have
such
representation
on
the
executive
committee
as
we
desire.
and
it
is
the
writers
belief,
that
ultimately,
the
du
pont
company
will
absolutely
control
and
dominate
the
whole
general
motors
situation,
with
the
entire
approval
of
mr.
durant,
who
i
think
will
eventually
place
his
holdings
with
us
taking
his
payment,
therefore,
in
some
securities
mutually
satisfactory."
the
executive
committee
and
the
finance
committee
approved
the
purchase
of
this
stock
on
the
basis
of
this
memorandum.
this
memorandum
was
again
read
to
the
board
of
directors
itself.
this
is
in
december
of
1917.and
the
board
of
directors,
having
heard
this
memorandum,
also
approved
the
purchase.
it
went
through.
they
bought
250,000
shares
of
the
stock.
it
amounted
to
about
23%
of
the
stock
even
in
those
days.
within
the
next
two
years
they
increased
their
--
their
investment
to
about
$48,000,000
and
their
percentage
of
control
rose
to
28%.
and
pursuant
to
the
agreement
with
mr.
durant,
the
du
pont
representatives
were
elected
to
the
board
of
directors
and
to
the
committees,
and
the
partnership
became
effective.
now,
it's
about
three
years
after
this,
in
1920
that
mr.
durant
got
into
trouble
by
over
extending
himself
on
the
stock
market
in
supporting
general
motors
stock.
he
was
in
grave
danger
of
--
of
bankruptcy.
the
du
pont
corporation
took
over,
paid
off
his
loans,
and
took
over
his
stock
themselves.
thus,
it
was
late
in
the
--
in
1920
that
du
pont
became
the
holder
of
38%
of
the
general
motors
stock,
with
an
investment
of
$75,000,000
and
mr.
durant
was
out
of
the
picture.
mr.
pierre
s.
du
pont
was
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
was
in
december
of
1920
of
--
of
january
of
1921,
and
i
used
the
date
of
december
1920.
it's
about
three
years
after
the
original
purchase.
mr.
pierre
s.
du
pont
became
president
of
general
motors.
du
pont
nominees
took
a
majority
of
the
positions
on
both
the
executive
committee
and
the
finance
committee
of
general
motors.
now,
speaking
of
the
interlocking
directorates,
which
commence
back
in
this
time,
it's
noteworthy
to,
right
in
the
beginning
to
notice
that
mr.
pierre
du
pont,
served
as
chairman
of
the
board
of
both
du
pont
and
general
motors,
continually
from
1919
until
1929.
and
when
he
retired
from
the
chairmanship
of
the
general
motors
board,
his
brother,
mr.
lammot
du
pont,
who
was
then
president
of
the
du
pont
corporation,
proceeded
to
take
over
as
chairman
of
the
--
of
the
general
motors
board
and
he
held
the
position
from
1929
until
1937.
now,
this
isn't
the
only
connection
between
the
two
corporations,
but
when
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
the
corporation
is
closely
tied
in
to
the
du
pont
as
--
as
this
situation
shows,
we
--
we
don't
have
really
any
question
but
there
is
a
close
interlocking
of
the
directorates
of
the
two
corporations.
it
was
also
during
this
early
period
that
the
man
who
really
bridges
the
span
from
the
early
days
to
--
to
the
present
days
came
into
the
picture,
namely,
mr.
alfred
p.
sloan.
mr.
alfred
p.
sloan
was
in
the
general
motors
setup
before
the
du
ponts
bought
in.
he
had
been
the
president
of
the
united
motors
corporation,
which
was
a
manufacturer
of
automobile
parts.
and
it
had
been
made
a
part
--
and
that
corporation
had
been
made
a
part
of
general
motors
while
mr.
durant
was
president.
mr.
sloan
had
come
with
the
corporation
and
become
a
vice
president
of
--
vice
president
of
general
motors.
but
when
in
1923,
mr.
pierre
s.
du
pont
decided
to
step
down
as
president,
it
was
he
--
it
was
he
who
recommended
that
his
successor
should
be
mr.
alfred
p.
sloan.
now,
the
court
below
and
the
appellees
in
their
briefs,
based
a
good
deal
of
their
argument
with
respect
to
the
independence
of
general
motors
upon
the
independence
of
mr.
sloan.
and
it
seems
clear
to
--
it
seems
clear
that
mr.
sloan
was
certainly
not
a
yes
man
in
any
sense
of
the
word.
it's
also
equally
clear,
that
he
was
originally
picked
for
his
position
as
chief
executive
by
mr.
pierre
s.
du
pont
himself.
mr.
raskob
wrote,
we
have
done
a
splendid
job
in
electing
alfred,
president
of
general
motors.
and
within
two
weeks
after
he
was
elected
president
of
general
motors,
he
was
elected
the
director
of
the
du
pont
corporation
itself.
he
was
richly
compensated
under
the
general
motors
bonus
plans,
the
allotments
of
which
--
under
which
were
primarily
responsibility
of
--
of
du
pont
connected
personnel.
moreover,
mr.
sloan
is
the
man
who
in
1926,
wrote
a
letter
to
mr.
irenee
du
pont,
then
president
of
the
du
pont
corporation
saying,
“you
must
recognize
that
i
am
essentially
or
at
least,
believe
and
hope
i
am,
a
member
of
the
du
pont
family.”
i
don't
mean
that
mr.
--
mr.
sloan
was
a
nominee
of
the
--
of
the
du
pont's.
he
came
up
through
the
management
but
there's
no
question
that
he
was
placed
in
his
position,
rewarded,
promoted
in
his
position,
and
rewarded
by
the
du
ponts.
and
he
--
he
could
not
help
but
have
known
and
trusted
them
and
have
been
inclined
to
--
to
favor
them
whenever
a
choice
arose.
as
to
--
as
to
actual
nominees
on
the
du
pont
board,
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
appendix
b
to
our
main
brief,
starting
at
page
154,
where
we
have
reprinted
a
general
motors
exhibit,
which
lists
throughout
the
years
the
du
pont
nominees
on
the
general
motors
board,
that
generally
amount
to
about
six,
sometimes
only
five
in
later
years,
five
or
six
directors,
specifically
nominees
of
the
du
pont
corporation,
of
the
du
pont
company,
but
one
should
not
be
mislead
by
the
terms,
management
and
du
pont,
over
this
list.
the
fact
that
a
man
is
listed
under
the
management
list,
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
he
has
no
connections
with
the
--
with
the
du
pont
corporation.
they
list
under
management,
such
men
as
--
as
mr.
brown
who
appears
in
several
of
these
lists
as
a
management
director,
and
yet,
mr.
brown
was
with
du
pont
long
before
he
was
with
general
motors.
he
remained
with
du
pont
after
he
went
to
general
motors,
and
i
believe
is
--
he's
now
listed
as
a
du
pont
representative.
these
men
in
the
management
were
in
many
cases,
placed
there
and
promoted
by
--
by
the
du
ponts
themselves,
and
one
shouldn't
think
that
we
have
the
management
as
against
du
pont.
they
are
really
allies
rather
than
opponents.
now,
in
addition
to
this
situation
of
interlocking
directorates
and
these
committee
positions,
the
committees
--
the
important
committees
are
also
listed
in
this
exhibit.
following,
they
show
the
members
of
the
executive
committee,
the
finance
committee
with
the
personnel
which
is
involved,
so
that
one
can
trace
the
du
pont
personnel
through
the
committee
setup.
in
addition
to
--
to
these
methods
of
making
control
effective,
an
important
feature
in
securing
the
loyalty
of
the
general
motors
personnel
were
the
bonus
plans,
which
were
sponsored
by
the
du
pont
company.
the
most
important
of
these
and
the
first,
was
the
managers'
securities
plan,
which
was
initiated
shortly
after
mr.
pierre
s.
du
pont
left
the
presidency
of
the
company.
he
suggested
when
he
left,
that
there
should
be
a
distribution
of
sale
to
the
executives
of
general
motors
of
the
stock
which
du
pont
had
acquired
from
mr.
durant,
about
$25,000,000
worth
of
stock
which
they
had
taken
over
at
the
time
they
paid
his
debts.
this
stock
was
to
be
sold
on
an
installment
plan
to
the
executives
of
the
general
motors
corporation.
it
had
--
this
installment
plan
of
purchase
had
--
had
two
benefits.
in
the
first
place,
it
enabled
the
du
pont
corporation
to
retain
the
voting
power
of
the
stock
until
sometime
in
the
mid-1930's.
and
in
the
second
place,
it
made
it
easy
for
these
executives
to
buy
the
stock
and
the
--
the
profits
which
they
made
from
this
plan
are
fabulous.
we
list
on
page
27
of
our
brief,
a
--
a
short
table
which
shows
how
much
these
executives
profited
in
the
--
in
the
first
few
years
of
holding
the
stock.
mr.
sloan,
for
example,
subscribed
to
$80,000
worth
of
stock.
this
was
in
1923
and
1924.
by
1926,
his
stock
was
worth
$2,154,000.
and
it
became
even
more
valuable
by
1929.
mr.
raskob,
placed
the
value
of
$20,000,000
on
his
stock
in
1929.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
loyalties
of
these
business
executives
were
for
sale,
and
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
people
who
made
these
allotments
of
these
bonuses,
considered
whether
or
not
the
directors
purchased
enough
paint
and
fabric
from
du
pont.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
the
individuals
could
not
help
but
be
well-disposed
towards
the
people
who
held
their
--
who
were
the
source
of
so
much
wealth,
it
--
it's
inevitable
that
they
must
have
--
must
have
felt
kindly
towards
the
du
pont
people
who
were
making
it
possible
for
them
to
--
to
prosper
so
--
so
extravagantly.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
don't
think
there
was
any
--
any
ascertainable
difference
in
--
in
the
amounts.
that's
--
it's
a
hard
question
to
answer,
because
there
were
such
--
there
were
such
variety
from
time
to
time
in
sales
to
different
divisions
of
general
motors.
i
--
i'm
going
to
attempt
to
sketch
what
does
sales
actually
were
and
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
i
think
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
but
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
myself
see
any
pattern
which
would
make
any
distinction
between
the
23%
and
the
38%
or
any
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
you
see
after
this
general
--
after
this
managers'
security
plan
distribution,
their
stock
fell
back
to
the
23%.
so
then
we
would
have
a
question
on
this
control
if
they
lost
control
then,
and
if
they
were
using
control,
then
we
had
accept
this
--
expect
the
stock
drop
in
--
in
--
as
we
would
have
expected
a
rise
perhaps
before.
there
were
other
subsequent
bonus
plans
after
the
managers'
securities
plan.
they
were
also
provided
very
large
compensation
but
not
as
--
not
as
fabulous
as
the
first.
and
always,
always
the
du
pont
personnel
were
in
the
key
position
in
determining
who
should
get
the
bonuses.
up
to
the
time
of
trial,
du
pont
continued
to
hold
23%
of
the
general
motors
stock.
today
it
is
carried
on
the
du
pont
balance
sheet
at
some
$700,000,000.
so
far
as
the
record
show,
du
pont
has
always
supported
the
management
slate
of
directors
at
the
stockholders
meeting.
and
that
is
natural,
if
we
are
correct
in
our
--
in
our
assertion
that
the
management
slate
and
the
du
pont
slate
were
one
and
the
same
thing.
anyway,
there
is
no
other
block
of
stock,
which
is
held
in
any
substantial
concentration.
actually,
the
--
the
rest
of
the
stock
of
general
motors
is
widely
distributed
and
--
and
held
by
about
half
a
million
stockholders.
at
the
stockholders
meetings,
du
pont
has
often,
more
in
the
early
years
than
now,
had
often
cast
more
than
half
of
the
--
more
than
a
majority
of
the
stock
which
was
represented
at
the
--
at
the
annual
meetings.
that
is
not
so
of
late
years.
of
late
years,
it
has
--
it
has
cast
about
30%
of
the
stock
which
is
cast
at
the
--
at
the
annual
meetings.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i
don't,
mr.
chief
justice.
although,
my
--
my
thought
would
be
that
probably
mr.
sloan's
holdings,
at
least
until
they
were
distributed
this
year
was
--
were
--
were
the
next
largest
holdings
to
--
but
that
may
not
be
so.
i
--
he
--
he
sold
about
$55,000,000
worth
of
stock
in
a
public
offering
in
1956
and
i
would
guess
that
he
was
well
up
in
--
into
the
--
the
next
highest.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
that
--
that's
the
book
figure
that
they
carry
it
on.
i
--
i
--
it
--
it
has
not
its
market
value.
i
--
no,
i
can't
--
i
can't
guess
--
i
can't
guess
at
the
proportion.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
they
gave
--
well
i'm
not
sure
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
had
an
agent
there
who
voted
their
stock,
get
them
on
the
stock.
mr.
john
f.
davis
23%
of
the
stock.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
actually
the
quorum
is
now
30%
in
--
in
general
motors.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
--
it
was
reduced
within
a
few
years
ago
to
30%
and
before
that
i
assume
it
was
50%.
i
don't
recollect.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
they
--
they
were
in
a
position
for
many
years
to
--
if
they
wanted
to,
to
break
a
quorum,
if
they
withdrew
from
the
stockholders
meeting.
there
wouldn't
have
been
of
a
quorum
--
a
quorum
then
to
vote.
there's
never
been
any
occasion
for
this
kind
of
--
of
power
voting.
i
mean
there's
never
been
a
fight
in
--
in
this
situation.
i
don't
really
know,
mr.
justice
reed,
whether
they
gave
their
proxy
to
the
--
to
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
management
or
not.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i'm
speaking
of
proxies
there
that
this
--
the
votes
--
the
--
the
stock
which
was
represented
at
the
meeting.
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
yes,
that's
--
that's
right
and
they
wouldn't
unless
there
was
some
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
now,
we
believe
that
these
facts,
which
i've
recited,
are
the
principal
facts
bearing
on
the
issue
of
control
and
it's
noteworthy
that
almost
all
of
them
are
recited
in
the
findings
of
the
court
below.
nevertheless,
the
court
below
came
out
with
the
conclusion
that
general
motors
did
not
control
--
that
du
pont
did
not
control
general
motors.
its
findings
are
on
this
subject
are
at
page
322
of
the
--
of
the
opinion.
otherwise,
the
pagination
of
this
opinion
may
confuse
you.
it's
the
same
pages,
which
appear
on
the
record.
we've
just
--
so
that
you
don't
have
the
opinions
with
two
separate
numbers.
when
i
say
322,
that
is
the
number
which
appears
in
volume
1
of
the
record
and
that's
why
it
appears
that
way.
mr.
john
f.
davis
not
specifically,
your
honor.
it
recited
many
of
these
facts
and
then
it
made
this
finding
at
page
322
which
may
indicate
its
criteria.
it
says
irrespective
of
what
its
position
may
have
been
before
and
during
the
durant
crisis.
since
the
1920's,
du
pont
has
not
had
and
does
not
today
have
practical
or
working
control
of
general
motors.
on
the
basis
of
all
the
evidence,
the
court
finds
as
a
fact
that
du
pont
did
not
and
could
not
conduct
itself
for
the
past
25
years
as
though
it
were
the
owner
of
a
majority
of
the
general
motors
stock.
we
believe
that
this
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
ceased
entirely
in
the
mid-1930s,
about
1935.
it
was
distributed
bit
by
bit.
so
until
1930,
they
held
the
entire
38%.
then
it
decreased
bit
by
bit
until,
i
think,
it's
1935,
maybe
1937.
it
was
sometime
in
the
mid-1930s
when
all
of
the
management
plan
stock
was
distributed.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
is
our
--
it
is
our
position
that
the
courts
findings
on
control,
show
a
misconception
of
the
relationship
which
is
necessary
to
find
in
order
to
--
to
establish
a
combination
in
restraint
of
trade
and
maybe
the
very
use
of
the
term
control
is
responsible
for
--
for
that
misleading
standard.
after
all,
all
that
is
--
is
necessary
to
prove
was
that
the
du
pont
relationship
was
such
that
it
influenced,
it
restrained
trade
more
specifically
that
it
interfered
with
the
normal
routes
of
trade
and
resulted
in
it
being
channeled
from
competitors
to
the
du
pont
company.
now,
that
doesn't
require
that
the
du
pont
company
be
in
a
position
to
give
orders
to
general
motors.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
not
even
power
--
i
--
i
think
there
was
power
to
control,
your
honor,
but
i
think
as
a
minimum
for
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
i
think
so.
but
i
don't
think
we
have
to
prove
power
for
general
control.
i
think
as
a
minimum
in
order
to
establish
the
--
the
combination
and
influence
with
--
a
--
a
sufficient
influence,
so
that
general
motors
trade
would
go
--
would
go
to
the
du
pont
corporation.
maybe
it
wouldn't
--
maybe
it
wouldn't
be
a
general
power.
maybe
it
would
just
be
that
it
would
influence
trade
in
the
majority
of
cases.
mr.
john
f.
davis
have
a
tendency
to
do
it.
there's
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
i
think
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
that's
right,
unless
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
it's
--
it's
a
shorthand
way
of
defining
an
inside
influence
and
it's
been
used
as
control
throughout
and
that's
why
i
use
it,
but
i
think
it
is
not
control
in
the
generally
accepted
sense.
i
don't
think
it
is
necessary
to
prove
its
control
in
the
generally
accepted
sense.
mr.
john
f.
davis
control
in
the
generally
accepted
sense
would
mean
that
they
have
the
power
if
they
wish
to
give
orders
to
the
--
to
the
officers
of
--
of
general
motors.
i
would
think,
mr.
justice
douglas,
that
we've
come
closer
here
to
what
the
utility
holding
company
act
would
call
an
absence
of
arm's
length
bargaining,
which
is
the
--
which
is
the
standard
which
is
used
in
addition
to
--
to
control
in
--
in
the
utility
holding
company
act.
and
if
you'll
remember
the
--
the
standard
for
an
absence
of
arm's
length
bargaining,
which
is
the
rule
of
thumb,
is
a
5%
ownership
rather
than
the
--
the
10%
ownership
which
is
used
as
a
rule
of
thumb
for
control.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
in
the
corporate
--
in
--
in
corporate
relationships
today,
one
rarely
has
absolute
power
in
these
cases.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
if
one
gets
into
a
--
into
a
proxy
fight
and
is
on
the
wrong
side,
he
can
--
he
can
lose
a
--
a
proxy
fight
even
though
he
has
more
stock
than
the
other
because
there
is
always
the
big
floating
supply
of
stock
in
the
hands
of
the
general
public.
so
that
actually
in
the
terms
of
corporate
control
as
--
as
has
been
before
this
court
in
the
holding
company
act
cases
and
others,
we're
talking
about
historic
relationships
about
the
--
not
about
people
giving
orders
but
about
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
in
this
--
in
this
case,
we're
not
talking
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
they
used
the
term
control,
but
again
as
they
say
the
test
isn't
whether
you
can
win
at
the
proxy
fight.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
there
is
no
such
term
in
the
statute.
you're
quite
right.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
this
sort
of
relationship,
whether
whatever
it
is,
is
a
combination
which
results
in
a
restraint
in
trade.
that
is
our
question
and
i
think
that
is
not
faced
up
--
faced
up
to
by
the
court
below.
i
think
that
they
were
thinking
of
control
in
a
more
arbitrary
sense.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
well,
i
--
well,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i'll
be
glad
to
discuss
that
now
because
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
it
doesn't
because
i
think
this
is
the
time
that
it
should
be
made
clear.
by
combination,
i
mean
in
the
sense
of
this
argument.
i
mean
specifically
a
stock
--
a
--
an
intercorporate
relationship,
not
an
agreement
but
this
entire
stock
relationship
is
what
i
call
a
combination.
and
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
certainly
would
make
a
combination,
whether
it's
a
combination
in
restraint
of
trade,
i
don't
know
but
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
that
is
the
sense
i'm
using
combination.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i'm
using
it
as
an
alternative.
mr.
john
f.
davis
as
--
yes,
i
mean
notably
alternative.
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
is
no
contract
here.
we
tried
to
prove
a
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right
and
there
is
no
--
at
least
as
far
as
the
argument
in
this
case
goes,
there
is
no
such.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
want
to
throw
out
and
i
could
have
a
win
with
it,
there
may
have
been
sorts
of
contracts
and
conspiracy.
i'm
--
i'm
not
conceding
that
there
weren't
but
i'm
not
arguing
them
here.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
i
do.
that
is
the
second
point
that
as
we
come
to
the
intent
of
--
under
which
they
--
they
inquired
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
to
the
combination
and
i've
completed
that
part
of
my
argument.
i
was
now
going
to
turn
to
intent.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
that's
--
that's
the
minimum
position.
i
think
there
must
be
more
than
that
here.
i
think
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
or
was
done
with
the
intent.
there
are
two
angles,
if
it
was
done
with
the
intent
which
i
shall
now
try
to
--
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
call
attention
merely
to
the
--
to
the
stockholding
cases
where
there
are
a
series
of
cases
where
a
control
--
actually
in
these
cases
they're
not
as
then
a
control
or
as
this
type
of
control
but
there
is
the
early
railroad
cases
and
some
of
the
others
speak
of
stock
relationship
that
is
being
a
combination.
now,
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
this
particular
relationship
is
that
kind
of
a
combination
and
then
it's
our
argument
that
it
is
but
there's
no
authority
on
this
court
that
this
stock
cups
out
of
a
--
in
a
corporate
relationship
is
a
combination.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
closest
we
come
to
it
is
--
well,
i
don't
think
we
come
close
--
very
close
to
it
and
this
court
in
calling
the
antitrust
provision.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
--
but
just
combination.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
sounds
like
a
consensual
arrangement
and
i
don't
mean
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
well,
that's
what
i
mean.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
what
i
mean.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
--
it
--
it's
in
the
same
nature.
it
takes
the
place.
maybe
if
--
if
you
put
beside
conspiracy
which
is
in
agreement
or
a
contract
which
is
a
form
of
it
it's
--
it's
a
means
by
which
you
restrain
trade.
it's
a
--
it's
a
joining
together
of
two
people,
a
combination,
a
joining
together
of
the
two
people
in
a
way
which
restrains
trade.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
they
think
it
used
all
these
terms
in
the
broadest
possible
sense.
the
antitrust
laws
were
--
were
drafted
with
an
idea
that
they
would
--
would
be
given
a
--
a
broad
construction
like
the
constitution
and
the
question
is
to
apply
them
to
--
to
economic
conditions
as
they
occur.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
in
most
of
those
--
i
think
in
that
case,
you
also
have
--
you
have
a
conspiracy.
you
have
like
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
in
many
of
the
cases
you
have
both
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
those
--
those
are
--
are
by
and
large
--
well,
i
don't
know
but
they
--
they
generally
talk
--
talk
also
in
terms
of
conspiracy,
your
honor.
i
--
i
--
the
early
railroad
cases,
i
--
i
referred
in
my
reply
brief
to
some
of
the
cases
which
i
think
are
the
--
are
the
straight
combination
cases.
sometime
later
in
the
argument
i'll
try
and
--
and
call
to
you
and
eventually
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
--
i
think
that
may
be
so.
we
--
we
come
to
the
second
question
and
that
is
the
intent
with
which
du
pont
purchased
this
interest
in
--
in
general
motors.
and
this
is
important
because
there's
nothing
illegal
per
se
in
--
in
one
corporation
controlling
another.
it
is
only
when
that
relationship
is
used
as
an
instrument
to
affect
an
illegal
restraint
or
where
it
is
intended
to
effect
an
illegal
restraint
and
it
falls
outside
the
law.
now
obviously,
there's
some
artificiality
in
talking
about
the
intent
of
a
corporation.
a
corporation
has
no
mind
of
its
own
and
--
and
so
strictly
speaking
the
corporation
as
such
doesn't
intend
anything.
but
what
we
are
talking
about
is
the
--
really
the
collective
intention
of
--
of
the
board
of
directors
which
directed
and
authorized
this
purchase.
and
the
board
of
directors
in
this
case
acted
upon
the
recommendation
of
the
two
important
committees,
the
finance
committee
and
the
executive
committee.
now,
there's
no
transcript
of
the
discussion
which
took
place
in
those
committees,
i
don't
suppose
any
was
made
at
the
time.
necessarily,
the
recollection
of
those
who
were
present
was
dimmed
by
the
passage
of
some
35
years
but
fortunately
the
record
in
this
case
provides
us
with
the
memorandum,
the
--
the
prospectors
--
prospectors
as
it
were,
which
mr.
rascob
laid
before
the
committees
when
they
acted
upon
this
matter.
this
is
committee
--
the
government
exhibit
124
which
i
referred
to
a
few
minutes
ago
and
i
refer
to
it
again
because
i
think
that
this
is
very
nearly
conclusive
on
what
the
intent
of
the
corporation
was
at
the
time
it
made
its
investment.
mr.
rascob
prepared
this
memorandum
and
it
was
reviewed
by
mr.
pierre
s.
du
pont
before
it
went
to
the
committee.
and
then
it
had
to
be
summarized
--
the
reasons
for
making
the
purchase
and
he
summarized
them
as
follows.
summarizing
the
above,
we
have
an
opportunity
to
make
a
substantial
investment
in
the
motor
industry
with
the
following
points
in
favor
thereof.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i'm
reading
from
page
9
of
our
brief,
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
following
points
in
favor
thereof
and
then
i
turn
to
point
five.
"our
interest
in
the
general
motors
company
will
undoubtedly
secure
for
us
the
entire
fabrikoid,
pyralin
paint
and
varnish
business
of
those
companies,
which
is
a
substantial
factor."
the
--
the
court
below
in
referring
to
this
memorandum
said
this
is
a
forecast
by
mr.
rascob,
he
thought
that
this
would
happen
but
that
doesn't
show
anything
about
intent.
well,
i
respectfully
suggest
to
the
court
that
when
the
governing
boards
of
du
pont
voted
on
a
proposition,
it
was
laid
before
them
in
writing
and
one
of
the
purposes,
one
of
the
aims
of
making
the
purchases
set
out
to
obtain
this
business
there's
more
than
a
forecast.
it
is
in
that
case
that
it
is
a
proposition.
they
--
they
were
voting
on
whether
or
not
they
wished
to
buy
the
stock
in
order
to
acquire
this
business
and
they
voted
in
favor
of
buying
the
stock.
and
when
they
reported
to
their
stockholders
in
1917
and
1918,
they
made
reference
to
the
fact
that
they
had
purchased
the
stock.
in
their
reports
to
the
stockholders,
they
called
to
their
attention
that
the
general
motors
corporation
and
du
pont
--
the
general
motors
corporation
did
a
big
business
in
the
--
in
the
products
which
du
pont
manufactured.
i
think
this
--
these
prospectors
if
you
please,
on
what
they
were
doing
in
1917
is
much
more
important
than
the
present
recollection
of
the
--
of
the
people
who
were
there.
mr.
pierre
s.
du
pont
and
mr.
irenee
du
pont
testified
during
the
trial
and
they
said
that
as
far
they
were
concerned,
they
didn't
think
about
the
trade
at
the
time
they
purchased
the
stock.
they
said
that
they
didn't
remember
that
there
was
any
discussion
of
the
trade
at
the
--
and
before
the
meetings.
well
i
don't
--
i
don't
question
--
i
don't
question
their
honesty
in
this
mistake.
i
--
i
think
--
i
do
suggest
that
35
years
may
dim
memory
but
whether
or
not
they're
entirely
honest
on
it,
still
it
seems
to
me
that
the
written
record,
the
contemporaneous
record
which
was
made
at
the
time
after
the
purchase
of
--
of
the
--
of
purpose
of
the
purchase
is
more
important
than
present
recollection.
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
as
far
as
the
intent
of
the
purchase
we
can
rest
our
case
entirely
on
--
on
government
exhibit
124.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
reports
to
the
--
i've
--
i
--
well,
yes
there
is
more
but
it's
tied
in
also
with
the
restraints.
we
will
find
as
we
talk
about
what
happened
in
the
sales,
that
there
was
an
exercise
of
--
of
influence
that
they
--
that
they
used
--
used
their
position
in
order
to
get
the
--
the
purchases
which
in
turn
must
relate
back
to
the
what
their
intent
was
at
the
time
they
made
the
purchase.
this
is
all
i
have
as
to
the
intent
at
the
time.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
subsequent
conduct
i
think
confirms
this.
i
--
i
say
not
only
this
--
this
memo
but
also
the
reports
of
the
stockholders
which
i
mentioned
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
yes,
unless
--
and
the
government's
case
has
three
legs.
it
has
one,
the
--
the
power
to
exercise
restraint,
control
whenever
we
want
it.
it
has
the
intent
and
it
has
the
question
of
whether
restraints
have
been
imposed.
i
think
that
the
third
leg
of
this
triangle
can
be
implied
from
either
of
the
other
two.
if
we
prove
a
power
to
control
--
power
to
restrain
and
if
we
prove
actual
restraints,
i
think
we
can
imply
from
those
two
an
intent
to
restrain.
if
on
the
other
hand
we
prove
a
power
to
restrain
plus
an
intent
to
restrain,
the
courts
have
said
that
it
is
then
unnecessary
to
--
to
prove
actual
restraints.
the
three
--
the
three
legs
support
each
other
and
insofar
as
they
are
consistent,
they
support
the
government's
case
if
one
is
weak,
it
weakens
the
government's
case.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
if
i
had
a
stronger
case
as
that
by
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
don't
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
it's
difficult.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
here
we
do
if
--
i
think
--
we
think
that
the
record
does
show
restraints,
not
--
and
--
and
we
think
that
that
supports
the
idea
there
was
an
intent
to
restrain
and
that
is
the
third
part
of
the
argument
to
which
i
am
coming
now
is
to
show
what
the
dealings
have
been
in
the
years
since
--
while
this
control
has
been
in
effect.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
it
is
not
mens
rea.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
certainly
isn't.
it's
a
question
of
--
and
i
think
i
should
be
clear
on
that,
too.
that
i'm
not
sure
there
was
--
i
don't
believe
there
was
ever
any
guilty
feeling
on
the
part
of
the
du
pont
corporation
in
--
in
this
case.
i'm
sure
they
thought
what
they
were
doing
was
for
their
benefit,
was
for
the
benefit
of
the
--
of
the
general
motors
corporation
and
if
you
please,
for
the
benefit
of
the
united
states.
i
--
i
don't
have
any
idea
of
accusing
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
won't
make
it
more
--
more
definite.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
there
is
some
evidence
of
that.
it's
mostly
in
the
early
days
but
there
is
--
there
is
some
evidence
of
--
of
an
attempt
to
use
direct
pressure
from
the
stock
interest
to
buy
and
i
--
i'll
--
i'll
mention
something
that
i
was
going
to
mention
a
little
later.
early
in
the
--
early
in
the
relationship
in
the
1920s,
a
memorandum
was
prepared
for
pierre
s.
du
pont
as
to
what
the
different
divisions
of
general
motors
were
buying
of
the
du
pont
products
and
it
appeared
from
this
memorandum
that
the
fisher
body
people
were
not
buying
as
large
a
percentage
of
--
of
products
from
du
pont
as
the
others.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
but
they
were
a
subsidiary
of
general
motors.
but
the
interesting
thing
is
that
when
they
were
acquired
the
--
they
were
--
it
was
a
separate
corporation
run
by
the
fisher
brothers
themselves
and
there
was
originally
a
voting
trust
setup,
so
that
after
the
majority
stock
control
went
over
to
general
motors,
under
the
voting
trust,
the
fisher
brothers
retained
the
authority
to
run
their
own
show.
they
were
kept
in
management
and
they
--
even
after
voting
trust
stopped,
the
fisher
brothers,
who
would
run
the
fisher
body
rights
from
the
beginning
were
--
were
very
independent
out
of
people.
they
didn't
take
orders
from
anybody.
well,
as
a
result
we
find
that
sales
to
fisher
body
were
falling
far
below
sales
to
the
other
divisions
in
the
--
in
the
general
motors
setup.
and
this
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
pierre
du
pont
and
he
said
--
wrote
to
his
brother,
i
think
it
was
to
mr.
lammot
du
pont
and
said,
“we
better
go
after
this
business.”
and
in
the
record
and
it's
referred
to
in
--
in
our
brief,
there
were
least
two
letters
written
by
mr.
lammot
du
pont
to
the
fisher
brothers
in
which
he
said,
“in
view
of
our
stock
interest,
in
view
of
the
relationships
between
the
company,
the
du
pont
company
and
general
motors,
it
would
seem
that
you
should
be
buying
more
of
our
product."
now,
that's
--
i
mean
that
isn't
any
statement
you
must
or
any
indication
you
should
buy
all
or
anything
like
that,
but
it
is
the
kind
of
thing
which
i
refer
to
as
showing
that
they
use
the
stock
relationship,
the
combination
as
a
device
for
--
for
getting
trade.
mr.
john
f.
davis
we
--
yes.
the
--
the
appellees
--
the
appellees
would
have
us
believe
that
the
relationships
between
general
motors
and
the
du
pont
corporation
are
precisely
the
same
as
they
are
between
general
motors
and
any
other
supplier
or
du
pont
and
any
other
supplier.
and
i
think
that's
an
impossible
conclusion
from
this
record.
there
--
there
is
a
difference
in
the
relationship
between
du
pont
and
--and
general
motors,
and
--
and
those
companies
and
others.
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
there
is
enough
special
about
that
relationship,
whether
the
relationship
is
strong
enough
or
extensive
enough,
whether
it
diverts
enough
trade
to
--
to
du
pont
to
constitute
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
law.
but
it
seems
to
us
transparent
on
the
face
of
this
record
that
there
is
something
special
in
this
relationship.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
don't
think
i
could,
your
honor.
i
think
that
if
there
was
35
years
of
this
relationship
there
hadn't
been
some
evidence
of
restraint
that
i
would
have
to
conclude
that
i
was
wrong
either
in
the
power
to
restrain
or
the
intent
to
restrain.
that
one
of
those
two
was
wrong
if
--
if
during
all
this
period
that
--
if
suppose
they'd
been
--
take
the
extreme
case.
suppose
there'd
never
been
a
sale
from
any
commercial
transaction
between
general
motors
and
du
pont.
it
would
seem
perfectly
clear
then
there
was
no
restraint
on
trade,
unless
it
was
a
restraint
on
du
pont's
trade
to
general
motors,
which
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
would
have
--
i
--
i
think
not,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
if
you
had
52%,
i
would
still
have
to
prove
either
an
intent
to
control.
i
think
there's
nothing
wrong
in
--
in
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
even
if
it's
52%,
if
there's
not
an
attempt
to
restrain
trade
through
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
is
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
is
--
there
is
one
--
one
caveat
on
that.
it
is
possible
that
by
getting
52%,
even
though
they
desired
not
to
restrain
trade,
the
relationship
was
such
that
they
have
to
be
presumed
to
desire
the
natural
consequences
of
their
act
and
so
even
though
du
pont
wrote
to
general
motors,
“don't
buy
from
us,
buy
from
everybody
else.”
that
they
would
know
that
the
--
the
relationship
was
such
that
du
pont
could
do
nothing
else.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
you'll
have
problem
under
clayton
act.
the
appellees
concede
and
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
understatement
that
du
pont
has
sold
substantial
quantities
of
materials
to
general
motors.
i
think
it
--
i
think
the
easiest
way
to
--
to
analyze
the
relationship
is
that
du
pont
has
always
been
and
still
is
the
largest
single
supplier
of
fabrics
and
paint,
antifreeze
too,
which
general
motors
has
had
in
good
years
and
bad
since
they
acquired
this
interest.
for
35
years,
du
pont
has
been
dependent
upon
general
motors
for
the
backbone
of
its
automotive
business.
in
the
last
year,
which
is
covered
by
the
record,
du
pont
sold
to
general
motors
$30,000,000
worth
of
--
of
these
products
and
in
view
of
the
expanded
automobile
production
in
recent
years,
we
can
assume
that
figure
may
be
well
under
what
it
is
since
the
record
was
closed.
mr.
john
f.
davis
$30,000,000.
mr.
john
f.
davis
gross
sales.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
of
all
its
products.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
i
overstated
its
sales
a
little.
it's
1,900,000
in
--
in
1955.
it
would
not
be
fair
to
assert
that
the
entire
amount
of
this
$30,000,000
of
sales
is
directly
attributable
to
--
to
a
controlled
situation.
it's
hard
to
draw
the
line
to
say
what
portion
of
it
would
have
gone
to
general
motors,
would
have
gone
to
du
pont
without
the
--
without
the
corporate
relationship.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
we
do.
mr.
john
f.
davis
we
--
we
do
and
i
--
i
think
i
can
give
them
to
you.
in
recent
years
of
fabrics
and
by
that
we
mean
largely
artificial
leathers
since
du
pont
doesn't
deal
in
the
part
fabrics,
the
woven
fabrics.
but
artificial
leather,
i
believe
they've
have
sold
40%
to
50%
of
general
motors
requirements
in
recent
years
and
as
to
paint,
it
has
sold
between
70%
and
71%
of
general
motors
automotive
--
of
general
motors
requirements
of
those
products
which
du
pont
sells
them.
mr.
john
f.
davis
by
du
pont?
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
i
did
that,
too
about
80%
of
du
pont's
sales
of
fabrics
go
to
general
motors,
in
--
in
--
this
is
in
recent
years.
that's
not
back
in
the
early
years.
about
80%
of
du
pont
sales
of
products
have
been
going
to
general
motors
and
about
93%
of
its
sale
of
paints
have
been
going
to
general
motors.
in
other
words,
general
motors
which
manufactures
or
during
the
period
involved
here,
manufactured
about
40%
to
45%
of
the
automobile's
manufacturing,
was
buying
93%
of
du
pont's
production
of
paint.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i
don't
have
the
--
i
don't
have
the
dollar
figures.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
more
than
the
major
portion
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
of
the
figures.
mr.
john
f.
davis
what
i
--
i
think
those
figures
are
very
significant,
too.
du
pont
attempted
to
sell
its
--
its
products,
its
--
its
paint
and
its
fabrics
to
the
entire
automotive
industry.
they
were
outstandingly
successful
in
selling
it
to
only
one
branch
of
the
industry.
in
other
words,
they
sold,
as
i
said
about
80%
of
their
fabrics
and
about
93%
of
their
paint
to
one
branch
of
the
industry,
namely,
general
motors.
now,
the
question
is
why
does
that
--
why
does
that
happen?
now,
there
may
be
a
number
of
reasons
but
it's
certainly
consistent
and
it
supports
our
view
that
the
stock
relationship
had
something
to
do
with
it,
that
there
was
--
that
the
stock
ownership
and
the
company
that
bought
such
a
large
portion
of
their
goods
from
du
pont,
coincide.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
district
court
draws
no
conclusion
about
that.
i
think
it
says
at
one
period
that
they
sold
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i've
got
to
check
on
the
findings,
i'm
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
not
sure.
mr.
john
f.
davis
if
--
if
they
advert
a
little
attention
to
it.
there
--
there
is
some
reference
to
--
to
sales
report
in
it
and
i'll
have
to
check,
your
honor,
that
i
may
be
able
to
do
it
at
lunch
or
something
but
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
yes.
the
record
shows
that
there
was
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes
--
i
--
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
that
is
right
and
i
think
one
type
--
one
line
of
produce
helps
us
to
understand
this
picture.
now,
i'd
like
to
mention
the
--
the
sales
of
duco,
a
particular
type
of
paint
which
was
developed
by
du
pont
in
--
in
the
1920s.
at
the
--
at
the
time
du
pont
developed
duco,
a
trade
name,
d-u-c-o
the
finishing
of
automobiles
was
very
different
than
it
is
today.
they
were
painted
and
then
they
were
varnished
and
rubbed
down
and
it
took
days,
weeks
for
them
to
dry
and
it
was
a
very
arduous
process
to
--
to
finish
the
automobiles
and
the
--
and
the
industry
was
crying
for
a
new
and
a
better
finish.
du
pont
developed
duco,
which
is
a
--
a
quick-drying
lacquer,
nitrocellulose
lacquer,
and
this
--
this
product
was
something
that
--
that
had
never
been
used
on
automobiles
before.
everybody
wanted
it.
there
was
no
question
then
about
du
pont
selling
to
general
motors
or
anybody
else.
say
anybody,
anyone
on
manufacturing
an
automobile
was
anxious
to
get
hold
of
duco
because
competitively
they
were
out
of
it
if
they
didn't.
and
so
for
a
few
years
after
they
manufactured
duco,
sales
were
made
throughout
the
industry.
then
other
paint
manufacturers
began
to
manufacture
the
same
kind
of
--
of
finish.
what
happened?
du
pont
retained
its
general
motors
business
in
duco.
still
has
it.
chevrolet,
buick,
pontiac
use
duco
almost
entirely
today.
but
their
sales
to
the
other
companies
as
soon
as
competitive
products
were
on
the
market
fell
off.
so
that
--
as
i
have
mentioned
a
minute
ago,
today
93%
of
the
--
of
the
paint
sales
and
a
large
part
of
that
is
duco.
93%
go
to
the
general
motors
cars.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
you
mean
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
they
favored
general
motors?
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i
don't
think
they
did.
it
started
out
on
pontiac.
pontiac
was
the
first
company
to
use
it.
and
pontiac
probably
had
used
it
more
than
anybody
else
because
they
were
the
first
customer.
actually,
general
motors
asked
du
pont.
they
said,
"can
have
an
exclusive
on
--
on
this
duco
product?"
and
du
pont
said,
they
didn't
think
it
would
work
well
that
other
competitors
would
come
into
the
field
if
it
were
done
that
way
and
that
they
preferred
to
sell
to
the
industry
generally
and
they
refused
to
give
an
exclusive
right
to
general
motors
to
buy
them,
to
buy
product.
i
don't
know
that
that
proves
anything
one
way
or
the
other,
but
i
mean
that's
specifically
what
happened.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i
think
you'd
have
to
get
a
cost
of
--
maybe
i
could
get
a
cost
of
fail
--
it's
not
good
mr.
john
f.
davis
i'm
afraid
i
don't
have
the
figures.
it'd
be
perfectly
huge.
however,
because
they're
gross
sales,
as
i
--
as
i
mentioned
it
was
12
--
$12,000,000,000
and
--
and
so
their
cost
of
sales,
i
don't
know
what
it
would
be
but
it
would
be
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
say
that
general
motors
takes
93%
of
du
pont's
production
of
paints,
automotive
paints
and
that
that
is
largely
duco.
oh,
and
let
me
correct
that
and
say
if
it
goes
in
the
record
and
in
1947
or
1948,
i
don't
know
what
it
is
at
the
present
time.
those
are
the
last
figures
in
the
record.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i
didn't
mean
to
give
the
impression
that
they
compete.
they
used
but
what
i
merely
meant
to
say
was
that
the
fabrics
is
a
more
limited
field
because
most
of
the
upholstery
in
cars
is
made
of
a
substance,
which
du
pont
doesn't
sell
and
the
artificial
leather,
which
is
used
for
trim
and
things
like
that,
isn't
generally
used
for
the
general
upholstery
of
cars.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
in
the
early
--
in
the
early
days
of
the
automobile
industry,
there
was
much
more
use
for
du
pont
products
before
the
steel
top
on
the
car,
there
was
an
--
a
--
a
top,
a
fabric
top
which
was
used
on
--
on
even
closed
cars.
the
window
curtains
and
other
--
other
fabrics
in
the
cars
were,
a
much
larger
percentage
of
them
whether
the
kind
that
du
pont
manufactured
in
the
early
days
than
--
than
it
is
sold
now.
i
want
to
make
reference
to
two
transactions,
two
courses
of
business
which
i
think
illustrate
the
--
the
business
relationships
between
these
two
companies.
the
first
one
is
in
money,
isn't
very
important,
but
i
think
it's
extremely
revealing.
in
1925,
the
du
pont
company
acquired
the
kentucky
alcohol
corporation,
the
manufacturer
of
alcohol.
and
thereupon,
a
du
pont
vice
president
wrote
to
mr.
alfred
d.
sloan,
who
was
president
of
general
motors
and
he
mentioned
the
acquisition
of
this
alcohol
company
by
the
du
pont
company.
then
he
mentioned
the
current
dispute
which
was
--
had
arisen
about
whether
alcohol
or
glycerine
was
the
preferable
mixture
to
be
used
as
an
antifreeze
in
--
in
automobile
radiators.
and
he
wrote
as
follows,
and
i
quote
his
letter,
"the
kentucky
alcohol
corporation
inquires
whether
the
general
motors
corporation
is
giving
their
official
approval
to
publicity,
favoring
glycerine
rather
than
alcohol.
if
so,
it
is
suggested
that
their
attention
be
called
to
the
interest
which
the
du
pont
company
will
have
in
the
future
in
its
manufacture
and
sale."
mr.
sloan
wrote
back
and
he
said,
"we
can't
take
sides
in
a
matter
like
this
as
to
which
is
the
best
product
to
be
used.
we
have
to
go
upon
the
facts."
nevertheless,
there
were
three
of
the
divisions
of
--
of
general
motors,
chevrolet,
buick
and
cadillac,
which
were
all
recommending
glycerine
as
an
antifreeze
in
their
instruction
books.
and
all
three
of
these
companies
--
well,
two
of
them
began
to
recommend
alcohol
and
the
other
took
a
neutral
position.
and
the
important
thing
about
this
is
that
at
the
very
time
they
took
this
position,
the
research
people
in
general
motors
were
firmly
of
the
position
that
prestone
was
the
preferable
antifreeze.
mr.
john
f.
davis
glycerine,
it
was
a
glycerine
combination.
at
the
--
there's
in
--
in
--
referred
to
in
my
brief,
there
are
a
series
of
letters
on
this.
the
way
it
ends
up
is
that
mr.
sloan
said
--
said,
"we've
decided
to
follow
up
policy.
what
we'll
do
is
to
include
in
our
instruction
books
a
fair
statement
as
to,
which
to
you,
as
to
the
advantages
of
each"
and
the
fair
statement
was
like
this,
"alcohol
is
--
is
cheaper
but
if
it's
spilled
on
--
on
the
surface,
on
the
--
on
the
finish,
it
will
mark
it.
glycerine
is
more
expensive
and
if
used
strictly
in
accord
with
the
manufacture's
instructions,
it
is
satisfactory.
but
if
--
if
the
connections
aren't
tight,
it
will
eat
out
the
engine
and
it
may
clog
the
radiator.
and
this
at
the
time
that
general
motors
was
itself
using
solely
glycerine
in
its
cars.
as
i
say,
money-wise,
it
isn't
important
but
from
a
point
of
view
of
showing
the
--
the
influence
of
a
stock
relationship
in
this
kind
of
a
business,
i
think
it
is
highly
significant.
far
more
significant
in
terms
of
money
is
the
lead,
the
tetraethyl
lead
picture.
lead
is
a
compound
which
--
tetraethyl
lead
is
a
compound,
which
today
is
added
to
gasoline
to
improve
its
performance
in
internal
combustion
engines.
the
discovery
of
this
substance
was
made
by
two
general
motors
inventors,
a
dr.
midgley
and
mr.
kettering.
it'd
be
hard
to
overemphasize
the
importance
of
this
discovery
at
the
time
it
was
made.
it
was
immediately
recognized
by
both
du
pont
and
general
motors
that
the
addition
of
lead
to
the
gasoline
would
tremendously
improve
its
performance
and
it
was
a
very
important
thing
in
the
automobile
industry.
now,
du
pont
had
no
facilities
at
this
time
for
manufacturing
tetraethyl
lead.
nobody
had
manufactured
tetraethyl
lead
up
to
that
time.
it
was
a
--
it
was
a
laboratory
product.
it's
interesting
the
--
the
extreme
informality
which
--
with
which
this
invention
was
turned
over
for
development
by
general
motors
to
du
pont.
the
first
manufactured
by
du
pont
for
general
motors
was
done
without
any
contract
at
all.
later
on,
a
formal
contract
was
made.
now,
the
court
below
found
that
mr.
kettering
was
responsible
for
bringing
du
pont
into
the
picture
and
some
emphasis
was
placed
on
the
point
of
view
that
mr.
kettering
had
no
--
no
allegiance
to
du
pont.
well,
actually,
of
course,
it
was
far
too
important
a
matter
for
mr.
kettering
himself
to
decide
and
the
records
shows
that
mr.
sloan
certainly
participated
in
it.
and
the
final
contract,
the
contract
which
turned
the
development
of
this
tremendously
important
substance
over
to
du
pont
was
signed
by
mr.
pierre
s.
du
pont
for
general
motors
and
mr.
irenee
du
pont
for
the
du
pont
corporation.
and
du
pont
proceeded
thereupon
to
be
the
sole
manufacturer
of
tetraethyl
lead
for
distribution
through
what
was
called
the
ethyl
corporation.
now,
the
ethyl
corporation
was
formed
by
a
combination
of
standard
oil
company
of
new
jersey,
which
had
had
a
patent
for
the
manufacture
of
this
material
which
was
much
cheaper
than
the
way
du
pont
had
done
it
and
general
motors.
they
each
owned
--
standard
oil
of
new
jersey
and
general
motors
each
owned
one-half
of
the
stock
of
this
distributing
corporation
and
they
bought
all
of
their
lead
from
du
pont.
general
--
standard
of
new
jersey
was
quite
anxious
in
the
early
days
to
get
into
the
production
of
this
material.
it's
interesting
that
mr.
sloan
for
general
motors
and
the
du
ponts
stood
firm
against
letting
any
competition
in
on
--
on
the
production.
now,
it's
asserted
that
this
was
a
dangerous
product
and
indeed
it
was
dangerous
product,
and
that
only
--
and
that
only
du
pont
who
was
accustomed
to
handling
dangerous
things
could
--
could
do
it.
and
to
support
this
--
this
view
with
the
appellees
point
to
the
fact
that
standard
oil
had
a
pilot
plant
and
that
eight
people
were
--
eight
people
were
killed
through
lead
poisoning,
through
their
experimentation.
what
they
don't
point
out
is
that
the
only
way
to
learn
how
to
manufacture
this
stuff
was
by
manufacturing
it
and
that
a
larger
number
of
people
were
actually
--
contracted
lead
poisoning
and
died
in
the
--
in
the
du
pont
manufacture
than
did
the
in
the
standard
oil.
anyway,
throughout
the
years,
until
the
patents
ran
out,
the
exclusive
manufacturer
of
this
material
was
the
du
pont
corporation.
and
they
made
in
all,
$86,000,000
in
gross
sales
of
--
of
tetraethyl
lead
to
--
to
the
ethyl
corporation.
perhaps,
it
was
good
business
for
general
motors
to
turn
the
manufacture
of
this
over
to
a
chemical
company
and
very
likely
du
pont
was
well
equipped
to
--
to
do
this
manufacturing
for
them.
but
the
important
thing
in
this
picture
is
not
that
they
did
it
but
the
way
almost
automatically
happened
and
the
way
the
--
the
parties
assumed
that
this
--
this
was
in
du
pont's
field
and
no
one
else
should
--
should
stand
in
the
way.
at
one
time,
mr.
sloan
wrote
--
put
in
writing
this
statement,
du
pont
will
always
be
the
manufacturing
agents
of
ethyl
gasoline
corporation,
whether
we
make
tetraethyl
lead
or
whatever
we
make,
now
or
in
the
future.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
there
was
nobody
that
was
equipped
to
do
this
at
the
time
they
took
it
over.
that's
the
truth
of
the
matter.
there
is
some
evidence
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
du
pont
had
to
learn
it
as
i
--
as
i
point
out
they
had
to
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
--
i
think
there's
no
one
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
--
there
is
some
--
there
is
something
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
later
on,
other
chemical
companies
thought
a
way
from
doing
it
after
du
pont
against
--
against
our
view.
after
du
pont
had
been
manufacturing
this
for
a
series
of
years
and
after
the
--
the
accidents
occurred,
there
was
an
attempt
to
--
to
get
a
--
it
wasn't
really
by
the
du
pont
company
but
the
president
of
--
of
the
ethyl
company
thought
that
he
should
negotiate
to
see
if
he
could
get
a
second
source
of
supply.
now,
there's
no
indication
that
du
pont
would
have
gone
along
with
this
if
it
had
been
successful
and
he
approached
one
or
two
other
chemical
companies
attempting
to
see
whether
they
would
be
interested
in
providing
this
themselves.
nothing
happened.
they
--
they
said
that
they
didn't
want
to
do
it,
that
it
was
too
dangerous
or
something.
so,
there
was
maybe
even
some
indication
that
at
that
stage,
anyway,
no
other
companies
were
willing
to
--
willing
to
step
into
the
picture.
but
in
the
beginning
--
in
the
beginning,
when
it
was
important,
there
was
no
--
no
one
had
any
particular
competence
in
that
field.
that
i
think
completes
in
large
part
my
analysis
of
the
facts.
i
don't
think
--
i
think
i
would
prefer
rather
than
discussing
the
law
at
this
time,
since
i
think
--
once
we
have
these
facts,
once
we
have
or
if
we
have,
maybe
i
should
say.
if
we
have
a
situation
where
you
have
the
combination
entered
into
with
intent
and
the
resulting
restraints,
i
think
the
application
of
a
lot
of
the
picture
gives
relatively
little
difficulty.
there
are
problems,
legal
problems
which
are
discussed
in
our
briefs
in
which
i'd
be
glad
to
discuss
if
they're
brought
up
later
on,
but
i
think
i
would
prefer
to
retain
the
rest
of
my
time
for
reply
rather
than
going
into
them
at
the
present
time.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
there
are
--
there
are
--
maybe
it
could
be
divided
in
the
--
the
evidence
in
support
of
the
--
of
the
restraints
could
be
divided
into
three
parts.
one
is
the
statistical
material,
which
we
discussed
a
minute
ago.
two
is
the
--
are
the
particular
commercial
transactions
such
as
arose
with
respect
to
antifreeze,
tetraethyl
lead.
there's
another
one
with
respect
to
freon,
the
material
which
is
used
in
--
in
the
mechanical
refrigerators.
those
three
are
the
only
ones
i
recite
at
length
in
my
brief.
that's
the
second
class
of
evidence.
now,
the
third
class
of
evidence,
it
looks
like
picking
and
choosing
from
the
record,
if
you
please.
i
have
cited
in
the
brief
the
various
letters,
individual
statements
by
officers
of
du
pont,
where
they
state,
we
are
--
where
they
call
attention.
they
attempt
to
make
sales
on
the
basis
of
--
of
their
stock
interest.
that's
what
it
amounts
to.
there
were
two
from
lammot
du
pont.
there
was
one
from
--
there
were
two
from
mr.
pratt.
there
are
individual
examples.
these
would
mean
nothing
if
we
thought
that
these
individual
letters
--
if
we
had
just
support
in
on
it.
it's
more
like
fighting
an
iceberg.
i
mean
when
once
in
a
while,
one
of
these
letters
pokes
up
into
view,
it
indicates
what
is
below
the
surface
and
we
must
assume
that
if
--
if
you
can
find
the
--
these
expressions
of
this
view,
that
it
must
have
occurred
in
many
cases.
now
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
--
that's
i
think
that's
right.
although,
they
--
they
also
bear
on
the
third
because
a
letter,
a
letter
from
someone
in
control
to
somebody
else
saying,
we'd
like
you
to
buy
this
and
call
attention
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right,
that's
right.
that
is
--
that
is
true.
now,
there's
--
i
should
mention.
there's
--
there's
a
great
deal
of
evidence
that
the
appellees
put
in
this
record
with
respect
to
failure
to
make
sales.
they
put
on
--
well,
there
--
there
are
two
types
of
evidence
that
they
--
that
they
rely
on.
one,
they
put
on
a
large
number
of
witnesses,
many
of
them
salesmen
or
purchasing
agents
who
gave
direct
testimony
that
in
their
relations
they
didn't
consider.
they're
the
stock
ownership
and
i
--
i
think
that
those
people
didn't.
i
mean,
i
think
that
they
--
they
carried
out
the
--
they
carried
out
their
duties
as
purchases
and
sales
agents
perfectly
normally.
i
don't
think
that
there
was
any
intent
on
their
part
to
--
the
salesmen
would
have
been
poor
salesmen
if
they'd
tried
to
--
tried
to
push
the
ownership
and
i
think
purchasing
agents,
too,
were
not
under
any
compulsion
to
buy
these
things.
the
other
thing
they
put
in
evidence
is
failure
to
make
sales.
they
--
they
point
out
times
when
this
or
that
product
was
not
sold
to
this
or
that
division
of
--
of
general
motors
and
this
too,
we
must
concede.
general
motors
didn't
--
du
pont
didn't
get
all
of
the
sales
that
it
would
have
liked
to
have
got.
it
didn't
have
100%
of
the
sales.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
some
of
the
letters
are
written
fairly
well
down
the
line.
i
mean
they're
written
by
people
in
the
executive
rank
to
people
in
the
management
rank.
so
that
they
--
they
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
some
of
--
yes.
they
may
--
they
might
say
that
it
--
it
may.
i
don't
know.
there
--
there
are
a
tremendous
number
of
purchasing
agents
and
salesmen
in
this
--
in
this
picture.
i
--
some
of
them
must
have
--
must
have
felt
some
compulsions
somewhere
along
the
line
or
--
or
it
wouldn't
have
worked.
i
mean
if
--
if
everyone
who
purchased
well
and
walked
way
down
the
line
had
felt
complete
independence
from
the
stock
ownership,
it
would
have
had
no
relationship.
so,
i
think
the
record
itself
shows
that
there
was
a
recognition
of
that
relation.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
don't
think
--
specifically,
i
don't
think
that
the
district
court
paid
enough
attention
to
the
percentage
figures
on
the
tray.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
he
doesn't
have
them
in
there
in
detail
as
i
remember
it.
this
is
something
i
must
check
during
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i
--
this
is
a
pretty
fair
statement.
i
mean
if
i
were
writing
a
brief
--
if
i
were
writing
the
opinion
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
government,
there
would
be
more
things
i
would
put
in
and
they
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
this
is
a
pretty
fair
statement
of
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
this
is
a
pretty
fair
statement
of
--
of
the
facts.
it's
--
it
contains
--
there
are
omissions.
there
are
things
that
we
could
put
in
and
the
primary
one
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
no.
this
is
a
pretty
fair
statement.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
as
--
as
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
as
i
see
it,
the
clayton
act
is
a
cutting
out
and
making
specific
of
this
type
of
--
of
restraint
in
trade.
and
i
afraid
our
main
difficulty
with
the
clayton
act
is
that
it's
intended
to
act
prospectively.
it's
supposed
to
act
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition.
it
--
it
is
--
impinges
upon
an
acquisition.
and
our
legal
question
here
is
whether
or
not
it's
appropriate
to
apply
the
clayton
act
35
years
after
the
acquisition
has
occurred
and
we
say
that
it
is,
and
the
appellees
think
it's
to
the
contrary.
mr.
john
f.
davis
if
the
court
please.
first,
mr.
justice
reed
asked
me
about
authorities
for
a
stock
relationship
being
a
combination,
and
i
stated
that
there
were
no
cases
that
i
knew
of
certainly
in
this
court
where
a
less
than
a
majority
of
control
was
held
to
be
a
combination,
but
i
said
that
the
stock
interest
as
such,
the
none
consensual
type
of
--
of
combination
has
been
recognized.
and
i
report
--
refer
to
the
court
to
the
cases
cited
at
the
bottom
of
page
4
of
our
reply
brief
for
control
for
cases
where
stock
control
was
held
to
be
a
combination.
in
answer
to
a
question
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
said
that
there
were
references
in
the
court's
findings
to
the
sales
to
ford
and
chrysler,
although
i
did
--
did
not
believe
that
they
were
as
full
as
--
as
they
could
be.
looking
through
this
--
these
findings
during
the
argument
and
i
may
have
missed
something
somewhere
else.
the
reference
i
would
make
is
to
page
381
of
the
court's
findings.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
beg
your
pardon,
its
393.
i
--
i
gave
the
wrong
number,
393
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
that
is
wrong.
i
wanted
to
call
attention
to
381
of
the
record,
the
evidence
page
i
just
gave
because
fairly
in
mr.
cox's
argument,
he
said
he
was
going
to
point
out
other
places
in
these
findings
where
there
were
findings
by
this
court
that
were
inconsistent
with
positions
we
took.
and
i
was
interested
to
find
where
there
were
findings
of
the
court
that
were
inconsistent,
and
the
only
reference
that
i
heard
made
was
to
the
findings
with
respect
to
fisher
body
which
we
do
not
accept
too
and
which
appear
on
page
381.
there
is
a
statement
there
which
may
be
broader
than
--
than
i
would
make
it
but
i
still
take
no
exception
to
it.
it
says
the
record
shows
that
fisher
body
at
all
times
conducted
its
purchasing
with
respect
to
finishes,
fabrics
and
other
products
in
accordance
with
its
own
best
judgment.
and
basically,
that
was
our
--
that
is
precisely
our
position
that
fisher
body
did
that
and
that
that
is
why
there
was
a
difference
between
the
fisher
body
purchases
and
the
purchases
of
the
rest
of
the
divisions.
now,
to
be
sure,
there
is
no
cutoff
date
on
this.
it
doesn't
say
that
fisher
body
ever
started
in
buying
like
the
other
--
like
the
other
divisions
and
maybe
in
that
respect,
it
is
against
our
position.
but
basically,
this
is
the
position
which
we
take
and
we
have
no
exceptions
to
the
findings.
there
was
some
considerable
discussion
by
mr.
cox
about
failure
of
du
pont
to
sell
products
other
than
paints,
fabrics,
antifreeze,
to
the
general
motors
organization
and
specific
reference
was
made
to
case-hardening
chemicals
and
some
other
chemical
products.
they
tried
--
i
--
i
would
say
that
du
pont
tried
to
sell
products
to
general
motors,
all
of
its
products
to
general
motors.
they
failed
in
some
cases.
we
haven't
gone
into
the
details
as
to
these
minor
or
less
important
products.
we
feel
that
if
we
have
established
that
there
is
a
restraint
of
trade
with
respect
to
paints
and
fabrics
which
has
been
the
subject
of
most
of
our
--
the
facts
in
our
brief
which
are
the
most
important
products
involved.
the
fact
that
they
failed
to
restrain
trade
in
other
products
is
--
is
not
a
--
is
not
an
excuse.
it's
not
a
--
it
doesn't
destroy
the
fact
that
there
is
still
a
restraint
on
paints
and
fabrics.
there
was
a
suggestion
made
at
the
beginning
of
mr.
cox's
argument
that
the
thorough
investigation
which
the
government
had
made
should
have
enabled
us
to
produce
affirmative
evidence
of
people
being
hurt.
if
this
is
a
--
if
this
is
the
kind
of
a
restraint
of
trade
which
hurts
people,
then
we
should
have
put
on
the
witnesses
of
the
other
chemical
companies
in
this
--
the
paint
companies
to
say
that
they
were
hurt.
as
this
case
was
tried
below,
it
was
tried
really
on
a
--
on
a
written
record.
i
think
there
was
probably
a
feeling
that
if
we
ended
into
competition
with
the
defendants
in
bringing
forth
oral
testimony
that
they
probably
could
submerge
any
testimony
we
had
in
--
in
many
thousands
of
words
of
testimony
of
their
own.
and
so,
the
case
was
really
tried
on
--
on
the
written
record
as
of
that
time.and
the
written
record
does
not
have
any
because
it
comes
lively
from
general
motors
and
du
pont.
it
does
not
have
any
--
any
substantial
amount
of
--
of
evidence
as
to
what
happened
to
competitors.
there
was
however,
one
example,
one
sole
example
back
in
the
early
days
when
du
pont
first
bought
general
motors'
stock.
there
was
a
man
by
the
name
of
mr.
mountain
that
had
the
flint
varnish
&
color
works.
and
the
flint
varnish
&
color
works
at
that
time
sold
very
substantial
amounts
of
paint
to
general
motors,
most
--
most
of
general
motors'
requirements.
well,
mr.
mountain
who
was
not
slow
to
understand
of
what
was
going
on,
he
said,
“well,
if
du
pont
has
bought
this
interest
in
general
motors,
i
am
not
going
to
have
any
business
left.”
and
he
went
around
and
he
offered
types
to
make
a
bargain
with
--
with
du
pont
to
staying
in
and
start
sort
of
a
partnership
basis.now,
what
really
happened
was
that
du
pont
then
bought
out
mr.
mountain
entirely.
they
bought
the
flint
varnish
&
color
works
entirely
and
mr.
mountain,
i
don't
say
they
didn't
buy
it
at
fair
price,
but
mr.
mountain
was
out
of
business
and
du
pont
was
in
the
business.
with
respect
to
the
tetraethyl
lead
picture,
i
think
it
should
be
made
clear
that
there
was
no
assignment
of
the
--
of
the
dr.
(inaudible)
patent
to
--
to
du
pont.
it
wasn't
handed
over.
what
happened
was
that
du
pont
entered
into
the
manufacturing
end
of
manufacturing
tetraethyl
lead
and
sold
it
to
the
ethyl
corporation
which
in
turn
licensed
gasoline
companies
to
use
it.
there's
one
interesting
thing
about
the
--
the
sales
which
they
made,
the
--
one
would
expect
in
--
in
the
--
if
there
was
arms-length
bargaining
that
they
would
have
sold
the
tetraethyl
lead
at
a
price
which
was
a
fair
competitive
price
that
was
determined
by
cost
of
production
--
i
don't
know,
and
be
determined
on
some
basis
that
--
of
bargaining
between
the
two.
what
happened
in
this
case
however
was
that
du
pont
made
a
calculation,
a
rough
calculation
that
they
would
receive
one-third
of
the
profits.
general
motors
would
receive
one-third
of
the
profits.
the
standard
oil
would
receive
--
standard
oil
of
new
jersey,
the
half
owner
of
--
of
ethyl
corporation
and
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
when
the
contract
was
made
and
it
was
on
that
basis
and
the
written
evidence
is
clear
on
this.
it
was
that
basis
that
du
pont
set
its
price
in
selling
tetraethyl
lead
to
the
--
to
the
ethyl
corporation.
now,
that
--
that
sounds
like
a
partnership
deal.
that
doesn't
sound
like
arms-length
bargaining.
that
sounds
as
though
they
were
in
there
as
a
--
as
a
matter
of
--
of
convenience
for
partnership
with
--
with
the
general
motors
corporation.
mr.
john
f.
davis
between
standard
oil?
no.
standard
oil
had
not
stock
relationship
with
either.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
well,
there
are
some
figures
in
our
main
brief.
it's
a
--
before
the
patents
run
out,
it
amounted
to
$86
million
but
there
were
more
figures
than
that
in
our
main
brief.
i'll
get
to
the
--
the
reference.
page
57
of
our
main
brief
shows
the
table
showing
the
--
the
net
sales
in
thousands
of
dollars
between
1938
and
1947.
and
the
total
figure
and
total
sales
appears
immediately
below
that
figure.
mr.
john
f.
davis
standard
oil
of
new
jersey
discovered
and
patented
a
method
of
--
of
manufacturing
tetraethyl
lead
which
was
much
less
expensive
than
the
method
which
du
pont
was
using.
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
our
main
brief.
maybe
there's
confusion
between
that
in
the
opinion.
i
don't
know
any
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
in
page
57
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
page
57.
mr.
john
f.
davis
[laughter]
there's
been
a
discrimination
there
against
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
[laughs]
mr.
john
f.
davis
[laughs]
mr.
john
f.
davis
[laughs]
mr.
john
f.
davis
without
intent
[laughs]
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
i'd
be
glad
to
provide
additional
copies
of
the
brief.
no,
standard
oil
of
new
jersey
invented
and
discovered
a
method
which
was
much
cheaper
and
much
quicker.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right
and
standard
oil
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
du
pont
contributed
the
know-how.
and
it
--
it
is
very
--
it's
very
probable
that
that
know-how
was
very
important
too.
i
--
it
--
they
performed
an
economic
function
in
this.
there's
no
question
that
they
did.
the
only
question
is
whether
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
i
don't
say
there
is
any
affirmative
evidence
to
that
effect.
i
say
that
the
evidence
shows
that
this
time,
nobody
was
manufacturing
tetraethyl
lead.
du
pont
had
no
experience
in
manufacturing
tetraethyl
lead.
they
had
no
experience
even
in
manufacturing
any
substances
closely
aligned
to
tetraethyl
lead.
it
was
--
it
was
a
new
field
and
someone
had
to
start
in
on
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
as
compared
with
the
industry
today,
no.
and
in
this
particular
type
of
thing,
there
was
nothing.
it
had
to
be
filled
up
from
the
beginning.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
there
were
other
--
there
were
other
large
chemical
companies
and
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i'm
sorry.
there
was
no
other
what?
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
my
inference
was
that
du
pont
didn't
know
anything
about
it
that
it
was
a
new
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
but
that
they
had
no
particular
competence
in
manufacturing
tetraethyl
lead.
i
mean
that
they
started
from
the
same
place
that
anyone
else
would
have.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
others
didn't
start
because
the
others
didn't
get
a
chance
to
start,
your
honor.
this
was
--
this
was
something
that
was
handed
to
them
on
a
--
on
a
silver
platter
to
start
with.
mr.
john
f.
davis
maybe
so.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
get
small
profit
from
it.
one
comment
and
i'll
be
through.
i
stated
earlier
in
the
argument
that
it
was
not
our
contention
that
du
pont
has
been
milking
general
motors
for
this
relationship.
they
haven't
been
using
their
stock
control
in
order
to
bring
an
advantage
to
them
which
would
be
a
disadvantage
to
general
motors
and
general
motors'
stockholders.
now,
that
must
almost
be
obvious
from
--
that
it
would
be
against
their
interest
to
do
so.
they
have
a
tremendous,
a
tremendous
investment
in
--
in
general
motors.
one-third
of
du
pont's
--
a
full
one-third
of
du
pont's
income
during
the
past
10
years
has
come
from
its
dividends
on
general
motors'
stock.
and
therefore,
it
is
important
to
them,
more
important
to
them
than
it
is
to
any
other
single
stockholder
that
general
motors
be
a
profitable
business
as
a
business
by
itself,
and
nothing
that
they
have
done
would
be
designed
to
hurt
the
general
motors
corporation.
