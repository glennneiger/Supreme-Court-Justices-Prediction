justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
your
--
that
was
not
the
view
of
the
dissent
that
you're
employing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
would
you
say
to
some
extent
how
much
do
you
set
out
of
what
wasn't?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
that
position
simply
was
that
in
your
court's
ruling
that
the
state
have
jurisdiction
that
must
enforce
the
federal
law
that
they
dealt
with
that
and
disagree
with
that,
as
i
would
give
it
--
as
i
would
give
this
to
mr.
justice
carter
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
it
is
that
--
and
it
is
that
that
the
state
law
should
govern
and
in
this
case,
the
state
law
does
not
make
this
as
a
labor
practice,
but
the
assumption
of
that
opinion
is
that
state
law
governs.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
doesn't
stand
(inaudible)
of
what
i
believe
that
your
permission,
namely,
that
10
(a)
is
the
exclusive
mode
by
which
--
that
which
statutorily
may
be
the
area
of
regulation
which
statutorily
may
be
exercised
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
can
be
exercised
by
the
states
only
if
you
have
the
formal
session
of
section
10
(a),
that's
your
position,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
haven't
given
any.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
they
say
is
that
what
this
conduct
here
is
legal
under
california
law
that
they
can't
be
outlawed
by
having
the
state
and
the
board's
federal
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
contention,
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
do
not
--
i
do
not
follow
your
argument
because
your
argument
is
fully
independent
of
the
board's
conclusion.
you
don't
care
whether
it
is
or
it
isn't
the
refusal
to
exercise
jurisdiction
that
even
if
they
refused,
as
you
say,
the
state
can
assume
jurisdiction
or
can
take
jurisdiction
only
if
there's
a
formal
session
under
10
(a),
isn't
that
you're
arguing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
that
isn't
the
board's
conclusion,
it's
very
--
never
mind.
it
isn't
--
it's
just
that
i
just
want
--
i
just
want
to
point
out
that
the
dissent
doesn't
reach
into
conclusion
that
the
federal
law
is
not
enforceable
not
in
constant
in
the
certain
circumstances
the
state
law
may
not
govern.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'd
be
grateful
to
you,
mr.
scully,
if
you
would
tell
me
under
what
answer
to
this
problem
you
wouldn't
have
a
moment
of
injustice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
so
that
the
problem
of
no
man's
land
was
very
unreal
to
answer
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
you
--
that
you
would
not
--
that
you
would
not
agree
that
the
direct
statement
of
your
california
law
was
just
part
of
it
on
page
54
namely,
and
of
our
law,
defendant's
activity
is
lawful
and
to
me
the
damages
of
injunctive
relief
is
proper.
the
majority
does
not
touch
on
this
proposition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
the
majority
of
questions,
one
that
does
assume
that,
of
course,
that
would
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
moving
on
from
there
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
produce
that
distinction
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
judge
to
go
over
to
another
point?
what
do
you
do
with
the
discussion
by
the
minority
of
the
difficulty
of
california
applying
federal
law?
i'm
referring
to
the
discussion
beginning
at
the
bottom
page
59
and
over
into
60.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
a
very
great
difference,
being
in
the
labor
field
and
most
other
fields
of
the
law
or
at
least
in
those
fields
of
law
where
the
law
hasn't
determined
by
courts
in
issue
and
where
the
law
gets
its
life
to
a
very
considerable
extent
from
the
prior
determination
of
the
administrative
agents,
references
that
may
have
been
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
about
the
commission
and
it's
the
same
as
true
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
--
and
behind
that
requirement
as
a
legislation,
a
series
of
great
view
consideration
of
authority
that
these
are
so
over
such
bearing,
such
elusive,
multicolor,
appropriate
circumstances
that
you
want
some
central
body.
let's
say,
this
is
it
and
not
leave
it
to
the
occasion
of
episodic
determination
of
a
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
what
you
--
you're
enforcing
that
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
[laughter]
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
trying
to
sustain
the
judgment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
we're
--
i
think
you
and
the
members
of
the
court
are
here
on
the
same
coercive
process
when
you
said
with
your
own
volition
(inaudible)
because
of
our
function.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
couldn't
sympathize
anymore.
