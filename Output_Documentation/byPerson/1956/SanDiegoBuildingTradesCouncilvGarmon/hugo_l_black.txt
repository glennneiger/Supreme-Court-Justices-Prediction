they
say
there,
i
don't
quite
understand
your
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand
your
citing
that
sentence
of
settling
your
problem.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
did
because
they
say
that
they
were
--
it
was
unlawful
in
california
because
it's
unlawful
under
--
under
federal
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
closed
shop
provision?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
basis
on
which
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
affirmed
the
issuance
of
the
injunction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
ground
that
it
was
--
was
unlawful
because
of
the
violation
of
the
federal
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
say
--
i
gather
that
one
argument
is
that
since
the
ultimate
objective
is
considered,
the
economic
pressure
was
to
obtain
a
closed
shop
which
is
at
proper
labor
objective
under
the
law
of
california.
the
purpose
of
picketing
was
not
unlawful
and
then
they
go
ahead
over
the
next
page
and
say
that,
"however,
it
is
unlawful
under
the
federal
act."
justice
hugo
l.
black
those
were
the
cases
which
as
i
read
them
had
held
that
it
was
lawful
to
have
a
closed
shop
in
california.

justice

l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
the
government
takes
the
position
as
i
understand
it.
maybe
i'm
wrong
about
that
brief.
they
take
the
position,
the
state
as
the
power
to
enforce
the
taft-hartley
act
that
it
can
go
ahead
just
as
you
would
on
the
fela
case
and
try
these
issues
where
the
board
has
declined
to
act
but
in
trying
and
the
state
must
follow
the
taft-hartley
act.
did
the
state
here
follow
the
taft-hartley
act
or
was
there
a
relief
granted
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
taft-hartley
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
--
you
take
the
position
that
the
state
law,
that
is
here
enforced,
has
enforced
substantive
state
law
the
same
which
--
is
that
which
is
in
the
taft-hartley
act
and
that
the
procedural
relief
granted
is
the
same
that
would
have
been
granted
in
the
taft-hartley
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
--
is
it
consistent
with
the
policy
of
the
taft-hartley
act
to
issue
an
injunction
such
as
they
did
here
of
peaceful
picketing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
a
limited
injunction
or
was
it
--
did
it
have
any
limitation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they
can
get
a
majority?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
under
the
fifth
taft-hartley
act,
do
they
have
to
have
a
majority?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
to
have
majority
in
order
to
be
able
to
picket?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
in
--
the
state
has
held
that
they
cannot
picket
if
they
have
a
minority,
isn't
it?
the
minority
cannot
picket.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
limited
to
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
the
order?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
order
--
is
the
order
in
--
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
all
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
enjoins
him
from
picketing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
can't
picket
at
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
it
says
that
no
--
no
--
none
of
them
can
picket.
it
can't
picket
under
the
law
they
have
adopted
here
just
peacefully
unless
they
represent
a
union
that
has
already
been
accepted
as
the
bargaining
agent
of
the
company.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
you
said
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
even
if
the
board's
contention
is
correct
that
10
(a)
does
not
mean
what
the
other
side
is
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
the
states
can
issue
injunction
such
as
they
have,
i
don't
mean
with
the
language
there
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
under
circumstances
of
this
nature
and
--
but
that
the
state
must
act
consistently
with
the
federal
advocacy.
i
assume
that
it
would
be
your
burden
to
show
not
merely
that
the
board
might
or
the
law
might
sometimes
hereafter
to
be
consistent
on
what
the
state
does,
but
it'd
be
necessary
to
hold
that
it's
consistent
with
the
federal
law,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
would
have
to
be
done
in
order
to
sustain
what
you
have
here
even
if
the
board's
position
should
be
accepted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
have
to
take
your
position
and
do
take
the
position
that
it
is
consistent.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
suppose
the
majority
read
what
he
said?
