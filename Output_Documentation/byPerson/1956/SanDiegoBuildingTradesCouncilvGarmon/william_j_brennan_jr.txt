in
further
of
your
point
that
if
the
board
had
taken
this
case
and
had
applied
to
a
federal
district
court
for
a
injunctive
relief,
this
is
the
kind
of
injunction
that
the
board
would
have
it
obtained?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
about
with
respect
to
the
recognition
of
picketing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
indications
are
rather
the
other
way,
aren't
they?
justice

i
said
the
indications
are
rather
the
other
way,
aren't
they?
justice

well

of
course,
in
the
evidence
that
the
board
will
draw
that
distinction
yet,
is
it?

was
there
any
suggestion
that
rather
than
--
as
i
understand
it,
this
was
a
restraint
against
picketing
period,
to
stop
all
picketing
business.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
any
suggestion
at
all
that
rather
than
that
that
the
restraint,
as
i
understand
you
to
say,
was
the
case
of
park
&
tilford
merely
against
pursuit
of
the
unlawful
objective
leaving
--
allowing
picketing
if
limited
to
organizational
picketing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know.
was
there
any
suggestion
that
the
restraint
be
limited
to
a
picketing
in
pursuit
of
the
unlawful
objective
allowing
them
to
continue
picketing
for
unlawful
objective?
