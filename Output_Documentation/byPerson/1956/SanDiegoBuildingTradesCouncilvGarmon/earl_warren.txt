chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
archer,
how
did
the
--
how
did
the
opinion
of
the
court
treat
that
question
of
--
of
whether
it
was
a
violation
of
--
of
california
law?
the
reason
i
asked
that
is
because
the
dissenting
opinion
on
page
54
says,
"before
discussing
those
points,
it
should
be
observed
that
under
our
law,
defendant's
activity
is
lawful
and
hence
neither
damages
nor
injunctive
relief
is
proper.
the
majority
does
not
question
this
proposition.
the
rule
was
stated
the
citation
of
many
supporting
authorities."
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
a
moment,
what
page
did
you
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
yes,
yes,
i
found
it.
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
other
language
in
the
opinion
other
than
that
that
you
read
bearing
upon
whether
it
is
unlawful
under
state
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
--
mr.
archer,
i'm
not
quite
clear
yet
on
your
theory
as
to
whether
this
is
a
state
law
or
federal
law
that
has
been
violated.
you
--
you
called
our
attention
to
the
top
paragraph
on
page
199
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
as
your
theory
where
it
says,
our
theory
was
that
it
charges
the
violation
of
the
law
of
the
state
of
california.
in
that,
the
ultimate
object
was
to
compel
the
plaintiffs
to
sign
the
contract
which
would
have
enforced
result
in
the
violation
of
paragraph
(a)
of
section
158.
now,
i
notice
in
your
petition,
on
page
3,
paragraph
6,
that
you
make
your
recital
of
the
misconduct
and
then
say
that
because
such
conduct
would
be
an
interference
with
the
collective
bargaining
rights
secured
to
said
employees
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
would
require
the
plaintiff
to
discharge
in
violation
of
the
said
national
labor
relations
act,
new
employees
who
refused
or
violated
to
join
one
of
the
said
defendant
unions
within
30
days
after
their
employment.
now,
doesn't
that
allege
a
--
a
violation
of
federal
law
as
distinguished
from
state
law
and
is
that
consistent
with
this
paragraph
on
199?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
thing
that
bothers
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
