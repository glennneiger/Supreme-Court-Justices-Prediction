mr.
charles
p.
scully
if
the
court
please,
with
respect
to
the
proceeding
as
mr.
ratner
has
indicated,
there
is
a
certain
similarity
between
his
case,
the
case
now
being
argued
and
the
case
to
follow.
however,
there
are
certain
basic
differences,
i
believe,
in
this
case
from
the
other
two
cases
and
so
i
think
it
would
be
desirable
to
indicate
what
had
transpired
in
the
courts
below
as
they
bear
upon
these
differences.
the
record
will
show
that
a
civil
complaint
was
filed
in
the
san
diego
superior
court
on
12
noon
of
may
7,
1953.
the
time
is
important
with
respect
to
the
alleged
contention
on
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedy
and
so
i
stressed
it
for
that
purpose
only.
in
this
particular
complaint,
at
page
2
of
the
record,
it
was
specifically
alleged
that
the
plaintiff's
business
affects
interstate
commerce.
with
respect
to
page
3
of
the
record,
the
allegation
shows
the
complaint
stated
that
the
defendants
were
engaged
in
conduct
which
was
causing
a
violation
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
in
demanding
a
so-called
union
shop
contract.
with
respect
to
page
4
that
the
defendants
were
engaged
in
certain
secondary
boycott
activity
and
--
and
the
complaint
requested
injunction
and
damages.
i
wish
to
stress
that
as
opposed
to
the
previous
case,
the
law
in
california
is
that
stranger
picketing
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
a
closed
shop
is
legal
and
permissible.
furthermore,
that
secondary
boycott
activity
is
legal
and
permissible.
after
a
demurrer
was
interposed,
the
--
a
answer
was
filed
denying
the
material
allegations
alleging
specifically
that
the
picketing
was
for
lawful,
peaceful,
organizational
purposes
and
affirmatively
raising
the
defense
of
one
of
jurisdiction
in
the
court
because
it
was
a
matter
which
fell
within
the
area
of
the
board
and
furthermore,
that
the
plaintiffs
had
not
exhausted
their
administrative
relief.
now,
an
ex
parte
injunction
was
granted
at
the
time
that
this
complaint
was
filed
on
may
the
7th,
1953.
and
on
that
very
day,
the
employer
in
this
case,
having
filed
this
complaint
alleging
all
these
factors
including
secondary
boycott
factors,
sent
to
the
board
a
petition
for
representation,
but
the
board
at
no
time
had
before
it
any
of
the
facts
alleged
in
the
complaint
going
to
the
question
of
the
secondary
boycott.
and
we
wish
to
stress
that
because
as
pointed
out
in
the
brief
filed
by
the
friend
of
the
court,
the
steelworkers,
there
are
different
standards
applicable
depending
upon
the
nature
of
the
remedy.
and
here,
although
they
simultaneously
proceeded
in
san
diego
in
a
civil
action
and
obtained
a
temporary
restraining
order,
they
filed
by
mail
with
the
board,
simply
a
petitioner
representation.
the
trial
courts
specifically
found
and
this
is
at
the
record
at
page
16,
that
the
employer
was
engaged
in
an
operation
which
affects
interstate
commerce
and
is
subject
to
the
national
labor
relations
act.
it
found
that
the
board
had
refused
to
take
jurisdiction
over
the
particular
controversy
as
a
result
of
this
representation,
petition
at
--
at
page
16
of
the
record
and
that
the
conduct
of
the
particular
unions
would
compel
the
employer
to
violate
the
taft-hartley
act.
it
was
then
taken
off
on
appeal.
and
after
an
intermediate
reversal
in
the
district
of
court
of
appeal,
the
supreme
court
affirmed
the
judgment.
and
at
page
48
of
the
record,
we
see
the
statement
by
our
supreme
court
with
respect
to
the
first
issue
that
has
been
raised
in
this
and
the
other
cases
and
the
court
stated
and
i'm
quoting,
“furthermore,
a
refusal
to
accept
jurisdiction
upon
the
ground
that
the
issue
presented
does
not
sufficiently
affect
the
national
welfare
to
justify
the
board's
attention,
in
effect,
is
a
declaration
that
the
national
labor
policy
will
not
be
jeopardized
if
the
state
assumes
jurisdiction.”
then,
going
over
to
page
52
of
the
record,
we
find
the
specific
holding
of
the
court,
quoting,
“since
those
decisions,
however,
the
federal
statute
has
been
broadened
to
extend
protection
to
the
employer
from
such
activities.
the
assertion
of
economic
pressures
to
compel
an
employer
to
sign
a
type
of
agreement
here
involved
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
section
8
(b)
(2)
of
the
act."
now,
i
wish
to
emphasize
that
because
the
board
in
its
brief
and
respondents
in
their
brief
attempt
to
avoid
the
effect
of
that
finding
and
indicate
that
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
below
is
not
based
upon
a
finding
that
the
defendants
have
been
guilty
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
the
federal
act.
and
then
the
court
continued,
consorted
labor
activities
for
such
a
purpose,
thus,
were
unlawful
under
the
federal
statute
and
for
that
reason,
were
not
privileged
under
the
california
law.
and
so,
we
submit
in
this
particular
case
the
issue
that
is
involved
is
where
the
board
has
declined
to
exercise
its
discretion,
where
under
the
state
law,
the
conduct
in
question
is
lawful
and
permissible.
can
the
state
court
in
applying
the
federal
law,
which
would
be
inconsistent
with
its
lawful
state
law
--
can
they
find
that
the
conduct
is
a
violation
of
the
taft-hartley
act
by
the
defendants
and
grant
injunctive
relief
to
a
private
employer?
and
we
submit
that
they
cannot
and
we
submit
that
the
key
to
this
complete
argument
lies
in
the
specific
language
of
section
10
(a).
questions
have
been
asked
to
previous
counsel
with
respect
to
10
(a)
and
so,
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
direct
my
argument
to
the
point
that
with
respect
to
the
statutory
provisions
of
10
(a),
they,
in
and
of
themselves,
exclude
states
from
asserting
jurisdiction
within
the
area
over
which
congress,
pursuant
to
the
frame,
but
decision
discussed
by
mr.
ratner
have
occupied
the
field
except
in
pursuance
of
the
restrictions
of
the
statute.
we
respectfully
submit
that
a
mere
reading
of
the
statute
on
the
face
will
establish
that.
but
should
there
be
a
question?
we
will
then
contend
that
the
legislative
history
will
confirm
it,
and
should
there
be
any
question
that
the
statute
on
its
face
and
a
legislative
history
do
not
support
that
contention,
that
then,
because
of
the
results
of
an
application
contrary
to
that
contended
by
us
and
particularly
in
the
garmon
case,
the
very
basis
and
theory
of
the
original
enactment
of
the
federal
statute,
in
the
first
instance,
will
be
forwarded.
and
so,
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
the
specific
language
of
section
10
(a)
and
the
proviso.
proviso
begins
as
follows,
“provided,
that
the
board
is
empowered
by
an
agreement
with
any
agency
of
any
state
or
territory
to
cede
to
such
agency
jurisdiction
over
any
cases
in
any
industry.”
now
mind
the
--
mind
you,
apparently,
the
contention
presented
by
the
board
and
by
the
respondents
in
this
case,
is
that
all
of
these
proviso
meant
is
that
in
areas
where
there
were
--
there
was
a
concurrent
exercise
jurisdiction
that
this
would
permit
of
a
session
arrangement
but
that
as
far
as
the
area
where
the
board
had
declined
jurisdiction
was
concerned,
that
this
particular
proviso
was
not
applicable.
we
submit,
first,
that
with
respect
to
the
clear
and
specific
language,
any
industry,
any
cases,
it's
an
inclusive
and
not
a
restrictive
term
and
accordingly
unless
there
is
something
found
later
in
the
statutes
that
as
far
as
those
words
are
concerned,
it
obviously
embraced
from
the
face
of
the
statute
itself,
not
only
those
over
which
it
was
concurrently
exercising
jurisdiction,
but
also
those
over
which
it
was
declining
jurisdiction.
and
then,
we
come
to
the
language
concerning
which
justice
frankfurter
inquired,
and
we
note
that
they
qualify
the
scope
of
areas
with
respect
to
which
this
session
can
occur
by
saying
"other
than
mining,
manufacturing,
communications
and
transportation."
and
now,
we
find
important
language
which
says,
“except
where
predominantly
local
in
character.”
now,
with
the
contention
of
the
board
and
the
respondents
in
this
manner
is
correct
that
the
first
portion
of
this
proviso
applies
only
to
areas
where
they
are
currently
exercising
concurrent
jurisdiction.
then
certainly,
the
language
reading,
"except
where
predominantly
local
in
character”
would
be
completely
unneeded,
because
the
session
provisions
of
the
section
would
not
be
applicable
to
those
local
activities
in
any
event.
and
so,
we
submit
that
by
the
insertion
of
that
qualifying
language
in
the
restrictive
discretion
imposed
on
the
board
with
respect
to
mining,
manufacturing,
communications
and
transportation,
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
it
is
clear
that
this
proviso
applies
in
both
areas
because
otherwise,
those
qualifying
words
would
be
rendered
completely
meaningless.
we
then
see
that
congress
further
had
in
mind
the
maintenance
of
standards
so
that
the
statutory
provisions
of
the
federal
level
would
be
prevalent
at
the
state
level.
and
accordingly,
they
provided
that
the
statute
applicable
could
not
be
inconsistent
with
the
corresponding
provision
of
the
act
or
have
received
a
construction
inconsistent
therewith.
and
so,
we
respectfully
submit
that
what
congress
had
in
mind
was
the
means
of
implementing
the
state's
entrée
into
this
field
but
on
condition
that
their
statute,
not
only
by
word,
but
also
by
interpretation
would
be
completely
consistent
with
the
federal
statute
in
language,
and
that
accordingly,
no
state
court
could
come
in
and
attempt
to
apply
what
it
believed
to
be
the
federal
law
where
the
board
was
not
active
and
say
that
that's
the
means
of
circumventing
the
provisions
of
the
statute,
here
contained,
which
are
clear
and
specific
and
consistent
with
the
intent
of
congress.
finally,
congress
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
in
establishing
the
board
and
the
procedures
for
the
board,
it
had
the
necessity
of
expert
qualified
people
who
in
applying
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
federal
statute
and
following
the
procedures
detailed
by
the
statute
for
their
application
would
have
to
make
and
exercise
of
discretion
in
the
establishment
of
a
policy
which
would
be
consistent
as
far
as
the
objective
of
the
substantive
provisions
in
the
procedural
provisions
were
concerned.
and
so,
they
wanted
to
ensure
that
from
a
policy
standpoint,
the
practical
application
by
the
national
board
of
the
substantive
and
procedural
provisions
would
not
be
thwarted
by
a
policy
application
at
the
state
agency
level
which,
although,
consistent
on
its
face
with
the
statutory
provisions
from
a
policy
standpoint
might
be
in
conflict
with
the
national
board's
policy.
and
so
they,
therefore,
require
that
it
have
to
be
by
an
agreement
so
that
the
national
labor
relations
board,
in
spelling
out
this
agreement,
could
ensure
that
the
policies
that
it
thought
consistent
were
integrated
as
part
of
that
agreement,
that
it
would
assure
that
the
policy
at
the
state
level
would
be
consistent
with
the
national
policy
and
that
it
would
have
the
overall
supervision
of
the
actual
operations
in
order
that
as
far
as
the
state
and
federal
concurrent
operation
in
the
field
permitted
was
concerned
would
be
totally
consistent.
we
respectfully
submit
that
on
its
face,
the
language
to
which
we
have
adverted
is
properly
constructible
in
that
way,
and
that
way
alone,
that
it
means
exactly
what
the
language
contended
for
by
the
petitioners'
in
this
case
contend
it
means,
and
that
accordingly
we
do
not
have
to
resort
to
legislative
intent
or
to
its
practical
application
to
establish
that
on
its
face,
this
statute
precludes
the
exercise
by
a
state
court
of
the
authority
sought
to
be
exercised
in
this
case
where
they
specifically
find
an
unfair
labor
practice,
and
instead,
permitted
the
occupation
of
this
segment
of
the
field,
the
term
used
by
the
respondents',
but
is
pointed
out
by
mr.
goldberger
in
this
friend
of
the
court
brief,
there
is
no
segment
which
is
easily
discernible
but
to
provide
that
in
this
area
of
declined
jurisdiction,
at
least,
and
this
is
the
area
that
we
are
concerned
with
in
this
case,
that
it
is
essential
that
the
provisions
of
10
(a)
be
applied
in
order
that
this
overall
framework
of
consistency
could
prevail.
mr.
charles
p.
scully
i
think
that
to
some
extent,
it
was,
mr.
justice.
mr.
charles
p.
scully
well,
i
think
the
position
is
--
mr.
charles
p.
scully
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
charles
p.
scully
i
--
i
think,
justice
frankfurter,
that
if
--
if
you
read
the
dissenting
opinion
with
respect
to
its
interpretation
of
the
majority
statement
which
is
found
at
page
46
of
the
record
that
it
notes
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
if
jurisdiction
have
been
exercised
would
have
occupied
the
field.
and
it
states
that
it
didn't
make
any
difference
whether
it
was
declining
to
exercise
or
whether
it
was
concurrently
exercising.
so,
i
submit
that
at
least
from
my
interpretation
of
the
dissenting
opinion
and
the
two
justices
joining
in
it,
it
does
not
stand
for
the
simple
proposition
that
the
state
should
apply
state
rather
than
federal
law
--
mr.
charles
p.
scully
it's
not
only
my
position,
but
it's
my
position
that
in
california,
there
been
no
statutory
language
of
any
site
comparable
that
obviously
the
court
cannot
act.
and
if
i
understand
your
construction
of
it
--
mr.
charles
p.
scully
well,
but
as
i
understand
your
construction
of
the
dissent,
you
are
inferring
that
they
are
ignoring
the
question
of
administrative
application
of
this
remedy
and
simply
directing
themselves
to
the
question,
should
the
state
court
apply
federal
or
state
law.
and
i
respectfully
submit
--
mr.
charles
p.
scully
well,
i'll
direct
your
attention
--
mr.
charles
p.
scully
well,
i'll
direct
your
attention
for
example
just
to
page
4
and
here's
the
statement
--
mr.
charles
p.
scully
on
page
54,
i'm
sorry,
of
the
record.
mr.
charles
p.
scully
and
here's
the
court's
statement,
these
conclusions,
and
this
is
--
i
understand
it
is
--
this
is
about
the
first
portion
of
the
--
of
the
dissent,
"these
conclusions
are
fallacious
for
the
following
reasons.
one,
the
national
board
and
the
powers
granted
to
it
are
an
integral
part
of
the
federal
law
and
that
law
is
not
intended
to
have
application
in
a
situation
where
the
board
plays
no
part.
it
is
inescapable
that
the
federal
law
is
to
be
administered
by
the
board,
not
by
the
state
courts.
the
board
in
refusing
jurisdiction
as
it
has
power
to
do,
has
in
effect,
determined
that
the
federal
law
should
not
apply
in
this
case.
three,
it
is
neither
feasible
nor
fair
to
apply
the
federal
law.
four,
there
has
been
no
such
a
refusal
to
exercise
jurisdiction
by
the
board
here
as
to
justify
the
conclusion
that
the
state
court
has
jurisdiction."
and
so,
i
respectfully
submit
to
justice
frankfurter
that
the
dissenting
opinion
is
consistent
with
the
position
being
asserted
by
arguing
counsel
in
this
matter
insofar
as
the
10
(a)
argument
is
concerned.
now,
i
will
concede
--
mr.
charles
p.
scully
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
p.
scully
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
p.
scully
well,
i
can
only
--
i
only
can
submit
your
honor
that
our
construction
of
the
language
i
have
quoted
appears
to
be
in
--
indirect
conflict.
now,
turning
now
to
the
legislative
intent,
your
honor,
reference
should
be
made
in
that
regard
to
the
language
in
the
report
with
respect
to
the
senate
labor
committee.
and
this
language
is
found
not
as
any
colloquy
between
senators
on
the
floor,
but
in
the
appendix
attached
to
the
report
which
is
an
analysis
of
what
the
bill
means.
and
as
noted
at
page
16
of
our
brief,
the
language
says,
“the
provision
which
has
been
added
to
this
subsection
permits
the
national
board
to
allow
state
labor
relations
boards
to
take
final
jurisdiction
of
cases
in
borderline
industries
(that
is
borderline
insofar
as
interstate
commerce
is
concerned)
providing
the
state's
statute
conforms
to
national
policy.”
now
we
submit
that
as
opposed
to
the
reference
of
legislative
intent
in
the
briefs
of
respondents
which
contained
a
brief
reference
to
a
colloquy
between
representative
kersten
and
representative
hartley
in
which,
when
analyzed
in
no
way
even
specifically
refers
to
section
10
(a)
that
certainly,
the
persuading
language,
as
noted
at
page
16
of
our
brief,
which
is
contained
in
the
majority
report
in
the
senate
where
the
language
initiated
as
to
what
they
thought
the
language
meant
in
their
analysis,
we
believe
is
superior
persuading
disclosure
of
legislative
intent
insofar
as
the
scope
and
effect
of
section
10
(a)
is
concerned.
mr.
charles
p.
scully
i
--
i
think
that
based
on
time,
it
will
be
test
upon
as
you
realize
--
mr.
charles
p.
scully
--
even
a
question
by
(inaudible).
no,
justice
harlan,
i'm
sorry.[laughter]
i'm
sorry,
justice
harlan.
and
--
and
as
i
understand
the
question,
it
is
directed
at
the
brief
with
the
board
in
the
portion
i
assumed
that
attempts
to
distinguish
between
alleged,
procedural
and
substantive
rights,
am
i
correct
in
that
assumption?
mr.
charles
p.
scully
well,
i
think
if
i
may
then
--
mr.
charles
p.
scully
--
if
--
if
i
say
if
i
may
then,
i
--
i
perhaps
should
go
back
to
the
argument
that
i
thought
we
had
concluded
with
respect
to
the
no
man's
land
and
attempt
to
point
out
that
with
respect,
for
example,
with
the
state
of
california
where
we
have
no
statutory
provisions.
we
have
a
court
coming
in
to
apply
a
federal
statute
without
any
administrative
procedures
of
any
kind
and
with
a
very
serious
question
existing
as
to
whether
or
not
the
federal
law
could
compel
the
state
as
part
of
this
judicial
operation
in
that
field
to
apply
administrative
procedures.
and
then
they
would
apply
in
that
field
a
law
which
is
consistent
neither
with
the
state
law
nor
with
the
federal
law.
and
so
we
submit
that
instead
of
their
being
a
no
man's
land
because
of
a
declination
and
a
refusal
of
the
states
to
enter
sure
of
a
--
session
agreement
that
it
will
create
just
the
opposite
result
and
we
think
the
garmon
case
is
classic
for
that.
namely,
that
the
considered
judgment
of
congress
in
enacting
the
taft-hartley
law
and
its
predecessor
was
to
have
a
national
uniform
policy
in
which
public
rights
would
be
enforced
and
in
which
the
entrée
by
means
of
private
suits
for
injunctions
would
be
eliminated.
to
ensure
that,
they
established
the
mean
for
an
expert
board
with
extensive
procedures
to
handle
administratively
what
a
court
would
neither
have
the
--
the
time
nor
the
staff
to
do.
and
in
order
to
have
a
uniform
national
standard,
it
is
our
argument
under
10
(a)
that
they
said
to
the
state
agencies,
“we
will
cover
the
field
of
industrial
relations.
we
invite
you
to
participate,
but
we
invite
you
to
participate
on
conditions
which
will
ensure
that
the
application
at
the
state
level
will
be
substantially
identical
with
that
at
the
national
level.”
and
if
you
do
not
adopt
that
construction
of
10
(a),
then
as
this
court
has
previously
indicated
instead
of
having
a
no
man's
land
when
the
board
declines
jurisdiction
but
at
least
not
having
a
multiplicity
of
applications
in
48
different
states,
you
will
have
the
exact
result
which
occurred
in
the
garmon
case.
in
the
garmon
case,
as
i
stressed
in
the
statement
of
facts,
there
was
no
time
when
the
board
had
presented
to
it,
the
alleged
conduct
going
to
the
question
of
secondary
boycott,
but
at
that
very
same
time,
that
conduct
was
presented
to
a
trial
court
in
san
diego.
now,
it's
our
contention
that
if
that
information
had
been
submitted
to
the
board
initially
rather
than
through
the
superior
court
and
only
a
representation
petition
having
been
filed
with
the
national
board,
that
on
the
record
in
this
case
when
the
board
had
investigated
that
case,
they
would
have
found
that
there
was
jurisdiction
under
their
yardsticks
based
upon
the
secondary
boycott
aspect.
and
we
submit
they
would
have
found
that
the
picketing
which
was
peaceful
in
all
respects
was
for
organizational
purposes
and
occurred
only
after
the
union
representatives
while
at
the
invitation
of
the
employer
spoke
to
the
man.
the
man
said
we
want
to
join
the
union.
the
union
representative
then
went
into
the
employer's
place
of
business
and
asked
him
to
sign
a
contract.
there
was
no
question
of
representation.
the
question
according
to
the
union's
contention
on
the
record
was
his
ability
to
pay
the
wage
demanded.
and
yet,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
employer
will
not
follow
up
on
that
procedure
and
the
union
then
strikes,
we
submit
that
we
have
the
intervention
at
the
state
level
of
injunctive
relief
which
is
aimed
at
conduct
which
is
guaranteed
to
the
union
under
section
7
of
the
act,
namely,
a
pure
organizational
picket
line.
but
on
the
contrary,
you
have
a
determination
by
an
initial
trial
court
followed
by
an
appellate
court
which
specifically
finds
the
item
that
there
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
8
(b)
(2)
of
the
act.
the
very
thing
that
congress
thought
at
the
national
level
was
so
complex
and
--
and
complicated
that
you
needed
an
expert
board.
and
it's
our
argument
accordingly
that
on
the
point
which
you
have
posed
the
question,
that
instead
of
the
contention
that
there
is
a
no
man's
land,
that
there
is
an
area
where
the
board's
can
come
in
but
the
area
has
to
--
the
state
boards
can
come
in
but
they
have
to
come
in
so
that
it
will
be
operated
in
a
mannequin
system
with
the
national
board.
mr.
charles
p.
scully
well,
that's
why
i
think
that
--
mr.
charles
p.
scully
no,
that's
why
i
think
the
garmon
case
is
an
excellent
example
because
to
--
to
create,
it
must
be
consistent
with
the
national
act
whereby
just
(inaudible)
pleading
as
they
did
in
our
case,
they
alleged
their
--
the
industry
affecting
interstate
commerce,
they
alleged
an
unfair
labor
practice.
the
board
never
had
that
information
to
determine
it
with
respect
to
the
unfair
labor
practice.
you
can
allege
facts
sufficient
in
the
state
such
as
ours
so
that
you
can
remove
yourself
from
the
application
of
the
local
law
which
renders
the
conduct
legal.
you
can
fail
to
apply
to
the
board
which
you've
been
exercising.
the
administrative
remedies
would
have
protected
the
conduct
and
by
going
down
the
middle
with
respect
to
the
area
where
the
board
declines
and
where
the
state
does
not
have
and
under
its
basic
local
jurisdiction.
you
will
have
the
third
remedy
device
whereby
you
can
obtain
private
injunctive
relief
in
direct
violation
of
the
underlying
theory
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
solely
by
failing
to
disclose
fully
to
the
board,
the
information
that
it
can
review.
and
so,
the
board
will
never
be
in
a
position
and
contrary
to
the
statement
by
this
court
in
the
garner
case.
this
court
in
the
first
instance
will
have
the
primary
power
and
duty
to
review
and
decide
that
determination
rather
than
the
board.
mr.
charles
p.
scully
i
doubt
that
you
could
give
answer
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
p.
scully
that's
right.
mr.
charles
p.
scully
that's
right.
with
respect
to
the
second
portion
of
your
question
if
i
understood
it
correctly,
mr.
justice,
it
appears
to
go
to
the
question
that
the
board
argues
that
by
the
mere
declination
of
power,
there
is
a
revitalization
of
a
reserve
power
in
the
state
to
take
jurisdiction
over
the
area
that
congress
has
originally
vested
in
the
board.
our
position
on
that
contention
is
that
when
congress
exercised
its
legislative
authority,
it
went
to
the
full
scope
of
its
authority
as
indicated
in
the
(inaudible)
decision
that
discretion
with
respect
to
permitting
the
occupancy
by
the
states
of
the
area
which
congress
gave
to
the
board,
the
discretion
that
was
to
be
exercised
was
the
discretion
of
the
board,
but
that
it
was
hand
hemmed
in
with
the
conditional
requirements
set
forth
in
section
10
(a)
of
the
act.
and
that
accordingly,
the
mere
declination
would
not
be
sufficient.
