mr.
james
w.
archer
if
the
court
please.
the
outset
i'd
like
to
state
briefly,
the
issue
as
i
view
it
in
our
case
and
that
is
simply
this
that
may
a
state
court
enjoin
concerted
union
activity
tortious
under
our
state
law
and
likewise,
violative
of
the
federal
laws
where
the
regional
director
of
the
nlrb
has
conducted
an
investigation
and
declined
to
take
jurisdiction.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
i
said
that
the
active
days
of
the
union
here
were
tortious
under
our
california
state
law
contrary
to
mr.
scully's
contention
that
they
were
lawful
activities
and
i
will
come
to
that
in
a
moment.
i
also
want
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
i
indicated
that
the
matter
was
investigated
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
by
a
field
examiner
and
it
is
so
recorded
in
the
records
in
this
case.
perhaps,
the
inadvertent
misstatements
of
mr.
scully
in
respect
to
the
activities
of
the
unions
rises
out
of
the
fact
that
neither
he
nor
any
person
appearing
on
the
union's
brief
in
this
court
participated
in
the
trial
of
this
case
in
the
lower
court
or
appeared
in
the
appellate
courts
of
california.
a
study
of
the
record
however
will
indicate
conclusively
that
the
nature
of
the
activities
were
unlawful
under
california
law.
the
plaintiff
employers
here
are
engaged
in
the
retail
lumber
business
at
the
little
town
of
escondido.
they
employed
eight
men.
the
representatives
of
the
two
unions
and
this
building
trades
council
called
upon
them
and
asked
them
to
sign
a
contract.
they
were
afforded
an
opportunity
to
discuss
their
proposals
with
the
eight
employees
on
two
separate
occasions.
the
men
did
not
indicate
at
any
time
a
desire
to
join
the
union
or
any
interest
in
it
contrary
to
what
mr.
scully
stated
here
a
few
moments
ago.
the
examination
of
the
findings
and
of
the
opinion
of
the
court,
the
majority
opinion
indicate
that
without
any
uncertainty
that
--
mr.
james
w.
archer
well,
i
think
with
due
deference
to
justice
carter,
he
is
in
error,
your
honor.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
majority
opinion
holds
that
this
conduct
is
lawful
wherein
they
cite
on
page
52
of
the
record
containing
the
majority
opinion
of
the
supreme
court,
the
end
of
the
second
paragraph
commencing
on
that
page
concerted
labor
activities
for
such
a
purpose,
thus
were
unlawful
under
the
federal
statute.
mr.
james
w.
archer
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
52
of
the
record,
which
is
the
opinion
of
the
majority
of
the
court.
mr.
james
w.
archer
in
middle
of
the
second
paragraph
commencing
on
that
page,
continue
in
reading,
and
for
that
reason,
we're
not
privileged
under
california
law.
they
cite
park
&
tilford
and
the
lillefloren
versus
superior
court
cases.
now,
in
the
park-tilford
case
--
mr.
james
w.
archer
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
james
w.
archer
well,
i
--
mr.
james
w.
archer
with
that
privilege.
now,
what
i
have
come
to,
sir,
is
this
that
in
those
two
cases,
park-tilford
and
that
lillefloren
case,
california
recognized
for
the
first
time,
although
i
must
confess
it
was
not
too
great
clarity,
the
difference
between
recognition
or
picketing
and
organizational
picketing.
in
the
park-tilford
case,
they
dissolved
a
portion
of
an
existing
injunction
on
the
ground
that
--
that
portion
of
it
would
prohibit
organizational
picketing.
they
upheld
that
portion
of
the
injunction,
excuse
me,
that
supported
a
demand
for
the
immediate
signature
of
a
contract
holding
that
that
was
unlawful
under
california
law
long
prior
to
it
being
unlawful
under
the
taft-hartley
amendment.
so
california
as
of
park-tilford
case
recognized
that
recognitional
picketing,
a
demand
that
an
employer
places
men
in
the
union
prior
to
there
being
any
indication
that
the
employees
as
such
have
designated
the
union
to
be
their
bargaining
agent
or
a
majority
was
unlawful
and
contrary
to
the
policy
of
the
state
of
california.
now
by
strange
coincidence,
the
lillefloren
case
cited
there,
subsequently,
the
31
california
case
was
an
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
carter
who
wrote
the
dissent
in
this
case.
and
in
that
case,
he
dissolved
then
in
or
that
he
on
behalf
of
the
five
other
justices
of
our
supreme
court
comprised
of
seven,
pointed
out
that
a
demand
for
a
closed
shop
would
be
unlawful
citing
at
park
&
tilford
case.
and
he
restates
that
the
order
should
have
restrained
only
the
unlawful
demand
for
the
close
shot.
on
this
question
of
the
california
law
on
recognitional
picketing
as
distinguished
from
organizational
picketing,
i
would
like
to
direct
your
honor's
attention
to
a
very
authoritative
article
that
has
appeared
in
the
december
issue
of
the
stanford
university
laws
journal,
law
review.
stanford
law
review,
december
1956,
it
was
published
subsequently
to
the
printing
of
these
briefs
with
its
very
authoritative
and
it
draws
this
distinction
which
i
am
endearing
to
draw
for
you
that
california
now
recognizes
a
difference
at
least
at
times
it
recognizes
a
difference
between
recognitional
picketing
and
organizational
picketing.
and
the
court
here
found
that
it's
--
this
fell
in
the
former
category
as
being
an
unlawful
demand
for
a
closed
shop
violative
of
both
the
federal
and
the
state
law.
mr.
james
w.
archer
no,
your
honor,
there
is
not.
unfortunately,
it
was
not
stated
with
more
precision
but
it
believed
to
be
the
intention
of
the
author
of
the
opinion
and
the
majority
that
they
were
making
that
distinction
but
did
not
state
it
with
precision.
the
findings
in
this
case
that
i
started
to
mention
when
judge
warren
asked
me
a
question
to
indicate
contrary
to
mr.
scully
that
the
--
the
fourth
finding
found
on
page
14
that
said
employees
have
indicated
they
do
not
desire
to
join
or
be
represented
by
any
of
the
defendants.
and
then
at
the
top
of
page
15,
the
court
found
that
the
unions
did
not
intend
to
induce
the
employees
or
plaintiff
to
join
the
said
union
or
to
educate
them
as
to
the
advantages
of
benefits
of
unionization,
so
that
it
was
strictly
a
recognitional
picket
line
that
confronted
us.
now,
we
sought
aid
of
nlrb
on
may
7th
as
mr.
scully
indicated.
and
on
may
21,
the
field
examiner
advised
us
in
writing,
"on
the
basis
of
the
information
submitted
in
your
letter
of
may
20th,
it
is
impossible
for
this
office
to
process
further
your
petition.
the
amount
of
business
done
by
valley
lumber
company,
the
name
of
the
co-partnership
of
the
garmon,
is
insufficient
for
the
board
to
assert
jurisdiction
on
the
basis
of
previous
board
decisions."
then
on
may
29,
after
the
field
examiner
had
made
his
report
to
the
regional
director,
the
regional
director,
mr.
howard
f.
laverne
wrote
to
the
valley
lumber
company
at
escondido
and
the
--
and
the
second
paragraph
of
his
letter
reads
as
follow,
"as
a
result
of
the
investigation,
it
appears
that
in
the
view
of
the
scope
of
the
business
operation
involved,
it
would
not
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
institute
further
proceedings
at
this
time.
and
i
am
therefore
dismissing
the
petition
in
this
matter."
now,
i
have
read
that
to
your
honor
because
in
the
opinion
of
the
majority
at
page
49,
excerpts
from
those
two
letters
are
quoted
in
the
opinion.
unfortunately
in
the
second
quote,
they
omitted
the
language
where
there
are
some
asterisks
there
before
the
close
of
the
quote.
they
left
this
language
out,
"and
i
am
therefore
dismissing
the
petition
in
this
matter."
i
think
it
is
of
importance
in
view
of
some
of
the
questions
that
have
been
asked
to
counsel
today
regarding
these
budgetary
and
other
considerations,
administrative
considerations
that
in
our
declination
here,
they
used
the
language,
it
would
not
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
institute
further
proceeding.
so
at
that
point,
we
appeal
to
the
court
and
obtain
our
--
our
injunction.
now,
the
--
some
question
was
raised
in
the
briefs
as
to
the
fact
that
we
had
--
did
not
ask
for
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
or
sought
that
relief.
there
is
a
discussion
of
that
in
the
record
in
this
case
and
the
testimony
of
mr.
waddell
that
he
discussed
that
with
mr.
laverne's
office
on
the
telephone.
and
as
a
result
of
that,
he
concluded
not
to
endeavor
to
file
one.
we
did
not
take
the
position
that
the
union's
activities
constituted
an
unfair
labor
practice.
our
position
and
our
theory
of
the
case
which
is
spelled
out
in
just
those
words,
our
theory
is
in
page
199,
top
of
that
page
of
the
record,
mr.
waddell
under
cross-examination
by
mr.
weiland
of
san
diego
stated
the
design
of
the
complaint
in
the
case
that
if
we
acceded
to
the
demand
of
the
unions,
we
would
then
be
compelled
to
violate
the
act
and
not
that
the
demand
itself
was
a
violation.
but
if
we
acceded
to
it,
we
were
then
being
put
in
the
position
of
--
of
being
in
violation
of
law,
and
therefore,
the
demand
was
unlawful.
now,
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
james
w.
archer
199,
sir,
the
top
of
the
page
commencing
that
the
line,
"our
theory
was
that
it
charges
the
violation
of
the
law
of
the
state
of
california
and
that
the
ultimate
object
was
to
compel
the
plaintiff
to
sign
a
contract
which
would,
if
enforced,
result
in
violation
of
paragraph
(a)
of
section
158."
mr.
james
w.
archer
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
w.
archer
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
w.
archer
well,
they
don't
say
--
say
that,
your
honor.
they
--
mr.
james
w.
archer
yes
and
then
in
support
of
that,
they
cite
the
two
cases
in
california.
mr.
james
w.
archer
are
you
referring
now,
sir
to
--
mr.
james
w.
archer
park
&
tilford?
mr.
james
w.
archer
it's
--
it's
lawful
to
have
an
organizational
picket
line
for
that
purpose.
mr.
james
w.
archer
but
it
is
not
lawful
to
couple
that
with
a
demand
that
it
be
signed
prior
to
their
being
any
showing
of
representation.
that's
the
holding
of
the
park
&
tilford.
mr.
james
w.
archer
no,
sir.
the
relief
grant
was
consistent
with
taft-hartley
and
consistent
with
california
law
on
this
subject.
mr.
james
w.
archer
well,
the
same
end
result.
mr.
james
w.
archer
if
you
have
to
go,
you
have
to
go
--
mr.
james
w.
archer
well,
yes,
your
honor,
if
--
because
of
the
secondary
boycott
aspect
of
the
picketing,
an
activity
of
the
union
here,
that
face
of
it
would
have
been
stopped
under
the
act.
mr.
james
w.
archer
it
had
only
the
limitation
that
they
would
have
to
seize
picketing
until
they
represented
the
employees.
in
other
words,
they
could
have
had
an
organizational
picketing
--
picket
line
inviting
or
inducing
the
man
to
join
the
union.
mr.
james
w.
archer
right.
mr.
james
w.
archer
yes.
mr.
james
w.
archer
no,
no.
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
james
w.
archer
you
have
to
have
--
i
didn't
know
what
--
i
--
i
missed
what
you
said.
mr.
james
w.
archer
no.
the
state
has
not
so
held,
sir.
the
state
has
held
that
they
can
picket
to
get
a
membership
to
invite
them
or
induce
them
but
they
cannot
picket
for
a
demand
that
the
contract
be
signed
forthwith
--
mr.
james
w.
archer
--
correctly
would
be
employed.
mr.
james
w.
archer
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
w.
archer
it's
--
well,
it's
quoted
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
or
during
--
near
the
beginning.
mr.
james
w.
archer
page
45,
your
honor,
right
under
the
--
in
the
last
paragraph,
they
are
right
under
those
figure
$1000
damages,
then
there
is
the
quote
of
the
entire
injunctive
order.
mr.
james
w.
archer
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
w.
archer
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
w.
archer
well,
when
the
last
clause
--
until
defendants
or
anyone
or
more
of
them
have
been
properly
designated
as
the
collective
bargaining
representative,
the
plaintiff's
employee
or
an
appropriate
unit
thereof.
mr.
james
w.
archer
oh,
no,
you
have
to
read
--
mr.
james
w.
archer
no,
i
beg
pardon,
sir.
you
have
to
read
that
to
get
the
purport
of
it
of
it
--
that
the
picketing
was
to
--
in
order
to,
in
the
middle
of
the
paragraph,
to
compel
plaintiffs
to
execute
a
contract.
now,
there's
where
the
--
the
difference
lies
between
a
prohibition
against
peaceful
picketing
to
induce
the
employees
to
join
and
that
prohibition
against
in
order
to
compel
the
plaintiffs
to
execute
any
contract
with
the
defendants
requiring
the
plaintiffs
to
discriminate
with
respect
to
conditions
of
employment.
the
--
the
recognitional
type
of
demand
ignoring
the
--
or
avoiding
the
effort
to
invite
the
employees
to
join
the
union.
they
just
take
the
shortcut
of
coming
in
and
say,
“here,
we
have
a
contract,
you
sign
it,
put
your
men
in
the
union.”
and
an
employer
says,
“well,
may
i
ask
my
men
or
will
you
ask
my
men
if
they
want
to
be
in
a
union.”
the
men
are
asked
by
the
representatives
of
the
union
and
they
say,
“we
don't
care
to
join
your
union.”
and
the
union
says,
“well,
you're
going
to
sign
for
the
employer.
you're
going
to
sign
the
contract
anyway
or
you
have
pickets.”
and
you
have
--
men
are
following
the
tracks
in
this
case
and
calling
on
costumers
and
asking
them
not
to
trade
with
the
valley
lumber
company
and
stopping
incoming
shippers.
mr.
james
w.
archer
yes
sir.
mr.
james
w.
archer
i
think
it
would,
your
honor,
with
respect
to
the
unlawful
secondary
boycott
activities.
mr.
james
w.
archer
that
i
do
not
know
of
whether
or
not
they
would
draw
that
distinction
between
this
recognitional
picketing
and
organizational
picketing.
that's
a
rather
a
--
a
--
mr.
james
w.
archer
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
w.
archer
i
don't
think
that
this
matter
of
the
distinction
between
the
two
types
of
activity
has
been
properly
presented
frankly.
mr.
james
w.
archer
i
--
i
think
that
it's
--
it's
--
mr.
james
w.
archer
no,
sir.
but
i
feel
that
the
courts
are
beginning
to
recognize
the
difference
between
the
two.
and
that
if
we
can
continue
to
point
out
that
there
is
a
legitimate
real
difference
between
just
going
to
an
employer
and
demanding
that
he
sign
the
contract
and
make
his
employees
member
of
the
union
whether
they
wish
to
be
or
no
and
in
picketing
to
invite
them
or
to
educate
them.
maybe
we
can
get
these
things
straightened
out.
mr.
james
w.
archer
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
w.
archer
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
w.
archer
i
think
so.
mr.
james
w.
archer
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
w.
archer
yes,
sir,
we
do.
mr.
james
w.
archer
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
w.
archer
i
think
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
archer
i
--
i
think
it
is
consistently
--
mr.
james
w.
archer
--
the
idea
of
being
that
if
the
ultimate
objective
of
the
picketing
is
unlawful
for
any
reason,
state
or
federal,
it's
enjoinable
under
our
law
under
the
park-tilford
and
the
other
cases.
now
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
w.
archer
--
there's
one
other
case
that
--
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
w.
archer
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
w.
archer
yes,
all
right
and
in
this
case,
sir,
they
could
have
picketed
for
organizational
picketing.
mr.
james
w.
archer
they
didn't
--
they
didn't
request
permission
to
picket
lawfully.
that
subject
was
never
raised
in
the
lower
court
at
any
time
that
they
were
trying
to
go
in
and
picket
to
invite
the
employees
to
join
the
union
or
induced
them
by
organizational
procedures
to
join.
they
stood
pat
on
their
demand
that
they
can
have
a
contract
with
the
employer
regardless
of
whether
the
employee
they
had
signed
up
a
single
employee,
so
that
was
not
an
issue
in
the
case.
mr.
james
w.
archer
i
--
i
think
that
judge
carter
is
wrong.
and
--
and
he
says
in
his
--
his
opinion
in
this
lillefloren
case
which
is
cited
by
the
majority
opinion
in
the
lillefloren
case,
31
cal.2d
cited
on
page
52
after
that
statement,
that
it
was
not
privilege
under
the
california
law.
and
judge
carter
there
draws
the
very
distinction
in
a
very
brief
opinion
when
he
draws
the
distinction
between
a
recognitional
and
an
organizational
picket
line.
apparently,
he
just
doesn't
forgot
at
this
time,
but
he
--
mr.
james
w.
archer
i
don't
know,
sir.
mr.
james
w.
archer
i
would
assume
they
all
read
it.
i
think
that's
fair
to
assume
they
all
read
both
opinions,
but
--
mr.
james
w.
archer
certainly.
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
w.
archer
but
to
answer
to
--
to
answer
your
question,
it
comes
back
to
the
same
thing
that
i
have
said
before
that
our
courts
have
--
have
recognized
the
difference
and
--
and
yet,
they
just
--
at
times,
they
don't
apply
it
to
the
--
to
the
factual
situation.
mr.
james
w.
archer
yes,
they
--
they
--
mr.
james
w.
archer
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
see
any
problem
there,
your
honor,
any
--
in
--
in
the
labor
of
field
anymore
you
have
it
in
the
other
field.
i
was
mentioning
this
morning
--
mr.
james
w.
archer
it's
a
problem
but
--
mr.
james
w.
archer
it's
--
it's
--
mr.
james
w.
archer
well,
i
--
i
agree
in
part
with
that,
your
honor,
but
the
--
the
fallacy
of
--
of
federal
jurisdiction
will
say
over
this
whole
field
is
pointed
up
right
here
classically.
mr.
james
w.
archer
i
am
not
here
of
my
own
volition.
mr.
james
w.
archer
i
represent
three
little
businessmen
who
had
eight
employees.
mr.
james
w.
archer
yes,
sir
--
mr.
james
w.
archer
--
because
i
feel
that
they
were
then
entitled
to
and
i
feel
today
they're
just
as
entitled
to
and
i
know
no
law
which
says
to
the
contrary.
mr.
james
w.
archer
but
i
--
i
mean
to
say,
your
honor,
that
the
--
it's
tragically
almost
ludicrous
that
you
have
to
come
to
washington
d.c.
to
protect
the
rights
of
a
business
of
that
magnitude.
mr.
james
w.
archer
and
time
is
up.
thank
you,
sir.
i
--
may
i
take
to
just
to
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
our
brief,
we
discussed
at
pages
28,
29
at
set
at
some
considerable
length,
the
10
(a)
features
--
interests
you
all.
