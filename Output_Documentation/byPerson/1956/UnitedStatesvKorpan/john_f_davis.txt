mr.
john
f.
davis
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
respondent
was
properly
convicted
for
willfully
failing
to
pay
a
tax
imposed
by
the
revenue
code
of
1954
on
coin-operated
gaming
devices.
and
this,
in
turn,
is
dependent
on
whether
three
particular
machines
which
the
respondent
maintained
on
his
premises
fall
within
the
depth
--
to
the
description
of
slot
machines
as
that
term
is
used
in
the
code.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
reversed
the
conviction
of
korpan
on
the
ground
that
his
machines
were
pinball
machines,
not
slot
machines,
and
were
not
subject
to
the
$250
tax.
now
the
facts
in
this
case
are
these,
the
respondent
maintained
a
summer
resort
known
as
korpan's
landing
on
fox
lake
in
northern
illinois.
and
then
a
tavern
which
he
had
there,
he
had
certain
coin-operated
machine
games
of
various
kind.
the
three,
which
are
involved
in
this
case,
were
games
which
were
activated
by
inserting
a
dime
in
a
slot,
and
this
gave
the
player
the
opportunity
of
propelling
five
steel
balls
onto
an
inclined
plane.
they
would
run
back
down
the
--
the
slant
of
the
--
of
the
table
and
fall
into
certain
holes
where
they
would
make
electrical
contacts
and
numbers
would
appear
on
the
panel
at
the
end
of
the
game.
the
object
of
the
game
was
to
strike
numbers
which
would
make
a
line
of
three,
or
four,
or
five
straight
across
vertically
or
diagonally.
mr.
john
f.
davis
there's
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
among
us,
there
is
some
manual
dexterity
and
how
high
the
ball
is
shot
but
the
evidence
shows
that
luck
is
the
predominant
element.
the
--
the
only
skill
which
is
involved
is
in
how
far
back
the
plunger
is
pulled
and
how
much
the
machine
is
pushed
by
the
hands
to
nudge
the
ball,
and
to
that
extent,
there
is
some
skill
involved
but
no
one,
however
skillful,
can
control
this
ball
so
that
it
won't
go
where
it
wants
to
--
the
majority
of
the
time,
luck,
chance
is
the
real
element
on
where
the
ball
would
go.
mr.
john
f.
davis
by
expert
testimony.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it's
in
the
record,
yes.
and
there
are
also
some
decisions
which
we
cite
in
our
--
in
our
present
and
some
on
that
particular
question
of
similar
machines
where
other
courts
have
determined
that
in
this
kind
of
an
operation,
chances,
the
predominant
element
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
there
is
--
there
is
some
degree
of
skill.
i
--
i
tried
one
of
these
machines
myself
and
i
thought
it
was
all
chance
and
a
small
boy
step
up
after
i
completed
my
play
and
he
did
much
better
than
i
did.
but
may
i
say
this,
there
are
elements
of
pure
chance
in
this
game
which
no
one,
however
skillful,
can
operate
because
this
particular
game
have
an
additional
gambling
element
of
putting
additional
coins
in
which
change
the
odds,
there
are
some
sort
of
a
wheel
whirls
within
the
device
and
it
changes
the
chances.
and
there,
all
you
do
is
to
put
the
--
the
dime
in
and
these
things
happen.
you
have
no
control
whatsoever
of
those
changing
in
the
odds
additional
game
elements,
they
call
them,
additional
bomb.
mr.
john
f.
davis
pardon?
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
maybe
so.
i
think
that
these
things
are
pretty
chancy.
i
don't
think
that
even
--
even
by
watching
when
they
get
extra
balls,
you
could
really
give
very
much.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
was
about
to
say
the
--
if
one
gets
three
numbers
in
a
line,
he
then
gets
for
the
--
a
certain
number
of
replays.
if
he
gets
four
numbers
in
a
line,
he
gets
a
certain
number
and
if
he
gets
five,
he
gets
a
much
larger
number.
now,
the
number
of
replays
and
these
replays
--
and
this
is
the
essence
of
the
case,
these
replays
are
redeemed
in
cash
in
this
case
so
that
they
are
--
although
they
have
found
the
right
to
replay,
there
are
also
a
right
to
receive
cash.
mr.
john
f.
davis
you
get
50
cents,
that
is
right.
now,
the
number
of
replays
which
you
get
for
getting
three
numbers
in
a
row
on
this
panel,
that
lighting
panel
in
front
of
the
machine,
may
go
up
from
four
to
six
to
ten
by
inserting
additional
dimes
in
the
machine
which
make
the
odds
more
favorable
to
you.
they
may
not
go
up.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
you
may
put
in
as
many
dimes
as
you
wish.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
after
you
get
through
with
the
five
balls,
you
may
again
put
in
additional
dimes
and
you
may
or
may
not
get
additional
ball
to
shoot,
and
these
too
is
determined
entirely
by
chance.
mr.
john
f.
davis
there's
no
evidence
in
this
record
except
that
there
is
evidence
that
two
players,
one
can
get
10
replays
and
the
other
12
were
paid
off
in
cash.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
at
one
time
he
said
that
if
--
that
he
could
assume
that
was
a
game
of
chance
and
then
another,
he
said
that
he
wouldn't
pass
upon
whether
there
was
skill
involved.
the
--
the
opinion
isn't
entirely
clear.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no
i
think
they
has
–
i
can't
tell
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
within
the
definition.
on
this
question
of
whether
there
was
chance
involved,
the
opinion
--
the
oral
opinion
of
the
trial
court,
the
findings
of
the
trial
court
that
this
was
essentially
a
game
of
chance
and
that
the
skill
element
had
been
reduced
to
a
minimum
was
--
was
made
in
specific
oral
findings
by
the
trial
court.
now,
those
oral
findings
are
not
reprinted
in
the
record
and
i'd
like
permission
to
--
they're
obviously
a
proper
thing
for
this
court
to
consider
and
i
like
permission
to
leave
a
copy
of
those
findings
with
the
clerk
so
that
they'll
know
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
before
the
court.
but
that
--
the
judge,
the
trial
judge
after
hearing
the
evidence
said
this
on
the
question
of
the
skill
involved,
this
--
the
element
of
--
the
element
of
skill
was
reduced
to
a
minimum.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
amount
of
skill
that
could
be
involved
in
those
machines
was
fantastically
small,
almost
nonexisting.
the
skill
was
supposed
to
be,
i
suppose,
the
force
with
which
you
shot
the
ball
or
the
force
or
lack
of
force
with
which
you
attempt
to
tilt
the
machine.
the
machine
was
so
devised
that
if
you
tilted
it,
it
would
go
out
of
commission.
everything
was
done
that
could
be
done
to
eliminate
the
element
of
skill
and
nothing
remained
of
any
consequence
except
the
element
of
chance
and
upon
the
device
of
that
kind,
congress
imposes
a
tax,
both
of
its
findings
of
the
district
judge.
well,
during
the
period
in
question,
korpan
had
purchased
$10
stamps
for
each
of
these
machines.
now,
these
are
the
type
of
stamps
which
are
used
for
amusement
and
music
machines
as
distinguished
from
so-called
"slot
machine."
and
in
june
of
1925,
a
especial
agent
of
the
internal
revenue
service
visited
the
tavern
and
he
asked
korpan
whether
he
was
paying
cash
on
eliminating
the
--
on
the
replays.
and
korpan
told
the
agent
that
he
was
not,
and
the
agent
explained
to
him
that
if
he
did
pay
out
cash
for
replays
that
he
would
be
subject
to
the
$250
tax
rather
than
the
$10
tax
and
korpan
said
that
he
understood
that.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
replay,
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right,
free
games.
and
that
is
generally
been
construed
by
the
--
by
the
service
as
not
being
a
thing
of
value
or
at
least
not
sufficiently
a
thing
of
value
to
--
to
make
the
--
make
it
into
a
way
to
pay
--
a
pay-off,
a
gambling
device.
mr.
john
f.
davis
between
two
separate
players,
it
doesn't
involve
the
operator
of
the
machine.
mr.
john
f.
davis
what
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
some
--
some
--i
don't
know
where
to
draw
the
line,
mr.
justice
burton,
because
obviously,
people
can
gamble
on
any
number
of
things
and
the
owner
of
--
and
the
operator
of
the
--
of
the
restaurant
can't
be
responsible
for
--
for
all
of
that.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
device
is
set
up
to
be
used
for
gambling
purposes,
i
would
think
that
he
would
then
have
to
pay
the
tax.
and
if
he
knew
that
it
was
consistently
used
for
gambling,
i
think
anyone
is
involved
in
the
case
but
we
do
not
have
this
situation.
this
is
a
--
this
is
a
situation
where
the
gambling
is
between
the
owner
of
the
restaurant,
the
operator
of
the
restaurant,
the
owners
of
the
machine.
mr.
john
f.
davis
he
is
paying
the
cash
to
the
plaintiff.
two
--
two
persons
played
these
machines
later
on
in
the
summer
and
were
paid
off
in
cash.
and
the
--
korpan
admitted
to
the
agent
who
had
discovered
the
violation
that
you
remembered
receiving
the
instructions
that
he
would
have
to
pay
the
$250
tax,
that
he
had
understood
the
instructions
and
that
he
had,
in
fact,
been
paying
cash
for
replays
even
when
he
said
he
has
not.
well,
as
a
result,
he
was
indicted
for
a
willful
failure
to
pay
the
tax
which
is
a
misdemeanor
and
he
was
convicted
and
fined
$750.
now
on
appeal,
the
conviction
was
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
which
held
that
this
type
of
machine
was
not
subject
to
the
$250
tax.
the
court
below
found
that
this
was
what
it
called
a
--
a
pinball
machine
and
since
it
was
a
pinball
machine,
it
said
that
on
the
language
of
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history,
it
wasn't
subject
to
the
--
to
the
larger
gaming
tax.
and
it's
our
position
that
the
language
of
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history
both
point
to
the
opposite
result.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
court
didn't
specifically
do
so
although
that's
what
the
defendant
claimed.
mr.
john
f.
davis
pardon?
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
i
think
that's
--
that's
basically
what
he
--
what
he
--
what
he
would
--
what
he
did,
although,
all
he
said
was
that
these
--
he
didn't
say
--
he
didn't
say
so.
he
said
these
are
pinball
machines
and
congress
certainly
didn't
intend
to
have
--
to
tax
pinball
machines.
the
language
of
the
statute,
and
this
is
as
the
court
concedes,
it's
purely
a
question
of
statutory
construction.
it's
--
it's
quoted
on
pages
2
and
3
of
the
government
brief.
there's
a
tax,
as
i
say,
a
--
$10
a
year
on
any
amusement
or
music
machine.
and
then
there
is
a
tax
of
$250,
and
now
i
read
from
the
bottom
of
page
2,
on
so-called
"slot
machines"
which
operate
by
means
of
insertion
of
a
coin,
token
or
similar
object,
and
which
by
application
of
the
element
of
chance
may
deliver
or
entitle
the
person
playing
or
operating
the
machine
to
receive
cash,
premiums,
merchandised
as
token.
now,
on
the
language
of
the
statute,
this
is
a
machine
which
is
activated
by
the
insertion
of
a
coin,
there's
no
question
about
it,
whether
or
not
--
and
--
and
the
element
of
chance
is
--
is
taken
cared
of
both
by
the
nature
of
the
machine,
the
findings
of
--
of
the
district
court
which
was
not
upset
by
the
court
of
appeals.
and
there
is
no
question
that
the
operators
were
given
the
right
to
receive
cash.
but
the
court
below
said
that
all
of
these
conditions
applied
only
when
you
started
out
with
a
so-called
"slot
machine."
and
the
court
below
said,
"this
isn't
what
i
consider
to
be
a
slot
machine."
now,
if
he
had
taken
the
ordinary
definition,
dictionary
definition
of
slot
machine,
which
he
quotes
in
his
--
in
his
opinion,
there's
no
question
that
it
is
a
slot
machine.
webster's
dictionary
defines
a
slot
machine,
as
a
machine,
the
operation
of
which
it
started
by
dropping
a
coin
in
a
slot
unless
the
court
recognized.
but
they
said,
when
congress
added
the
words
so-called
and
put
the
words
slot
machine
in
quotation
marks,
they
intended
something
other
than
the
ordinary
dictionary
definition.
well,
i
think
that
what
they
meant
--
what
congress
must
have
intended
by
that
--
that
form
was
that
they
didn't
–-
they
thought
they
were
using
a
term
which
wasn't
an
elegant
usage,
maybe.
it
was
a
--
it
was
a
common
term.
they
wanted
to
give
it
a
--
a
broad
scope
rather
than
they
use
any
--
considered
as
a
technical
definition.
now,
actually,
at
the
time
the
statute
was
passed,
coin
machines
that
are
used
for
gaming
were
generally
called
in
statutes,
and
by
the
courts,
and
the
digest,
they
were
called
slot
machines.
if
one
looks
at
the
gambling
laws
of
new
jersey
or
--
or
new
york
or
--
or
california,
oklahoma
and
any
number
of
states,
you
find
in
--
in
the
head
notes
or
in
the
definition
of
gambling
machines
that
they
use
the
term
"slot
machine"
as
a
--
as
a
definition
of
--
of
coin
activated
gambling
devices
and
then
they
go
on
and
define
the
term
very
broadly
to
include
all
sorts
of
--
of
coin
activated
devices
with
which
one
gambles.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
when
--
when
congress
used
the
term
so-called
"slot
machines",
it
was
merely
using
the
term
to
mean
these
things
which
are
called
and
these
certainly
were
called
slot
machines.
but
the
court
below
said
that
the
legislative
history
showed
an
intention
to
--
to
limit
it.
legislative
history
is
this,
the
statute
originated
being
a
revenue
measure,
of
course,
originated
in
the
house
of
representatives
in
1941.
and
at
the
--
at
the
time
that
the
tax
was
imposed,
there
was
no
distinction
drawn
between
different
types
of
coin
activated
games,
gambling
games
and
amusement
--
just
amusement
games
were
supposed
to
tax
$25.
when
it
got
into
the
senate,
senator
clark
felt
that
there
should
be
a
distinction
drawn
between
gambling
games
and
amusement
games.
and
he
proposed
the
amendment
which
results
in
the
differentiation
of
tax.
and
at
page
28
of
my
brief,
i
quote
when
he
told
the
senate
as
to
why
he
did
this.
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
for
example
he
said,
"mr.
president
it
seem
to
me
and
to
a
majority
of
the
members
of
the
finance
committee
that
it
was
a
disgrace
to
put
all
slot
machines
in
the
same
class,
therefore,
we
reduced
the
tax
on
the
innocent
slot
machines,
the
ones
which
do
not
involve
any
gambling
in
--
from
$25
to
$10.
and
then
he
goes
into
a
discussion
which
is
on
the
next
two
pages
with
senator
barkley
in
which
senator
barkley
said,
"well,
the
difference
you
were
trying
to
determine,
the
difference
on
which
you
are
pacing
the
tax
is
whether
or
not,
they're
gambling,
whether
they
can
get
anything
back
rather
than
a
pleasure
of
--
of
fame.
and
senator
clark
said
that
was
the
purpose
of
this
amendment.
and
that
is
the
background
of
this
change.
that's
why
the
change
was
made.
they
hit
the
gambling
machine.
well
in
1942,
a
year
later,
there
was
a
feeling
that
this
tax,
which
at
that
time
was
$50
or
higher
of
the
two
tax,
this
tax
was
too
high
to
impose
on
gambling
machines
that
you
put
a
penny
in
and
you
get
a
ball
of
gum
and
you
also
get
a
price
which
is
worth
not
more
than
5
cents.
and
so,
the
industry
came
in
and
they
said
“you
put
us
out
of
business
if
you
put
this
kind
of
a
tax
on
it."
and
so
congress
drew
an
exception
which
is
in
the
statute
today
saying
if
you
got
a
penny
from
machine
of
that
kind
that
it
shall
not
be
subject
to
the
larger
tax.
now,
if
congress
had
intended
only
one-armed
bandits
to
be
subject
for
the
larger
tax,
there
would
have
been
no
occasion
or
whatsoever
for
this
exception.
i
mean,
it's
perfectly
clear
that
no
one
would
ever
consider
one
of
these
one
cent
vending
machines
to
be
a
one-armed
bandit.
they
have
no
--
there's
no
connection
between
the
two.
so
these
two
is
an
--
an
example
of
what
congress
originally
intended
and
--
and
when
it
passed
the
statute.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
internal
revenue
service
has
had
a
regulation
on
its
book
since
1942
saying
that
the
tax
shall
be
imposed
in
the
larger
amount
where
three
games
are
redeemed
in
cash.
it's
been
made
--
that
too,
the
--
the
regulation
too
is
cited
in
our
brief
at
page
4.
but
that's
been
on
the
books
since
1942
and
it's
been
objected
too
by
the
industry.
there
have
been
congressional
hearings
that
this
is
too
strict.
congress
has
reenacted
the
statute
without
making
any
change
in
the
--
in
the
definition
of
slot
machines
knowing
that
this
regulation
was
on
the
books
and
was
being
enforced.
the
respondent
and
the
court
below
purport
to
find
that
there
has
been
no
consistent
in
--
in
administrative
interpretations.
there
was
one
inconsistent
interpretation
given
by
a
local
collector
of
internal
revenue,
a
single
inconsistent
interpretation.
the
only
one
way
we've
been
able
to
discover
and
i
think
that
it
was
a
mistake
and
doesn't
stand
in
--
in
the
--
in
the
way
of
our
position
that
this
statute
has
received
from
the
beginning,
an
interpretation
consistent
with
that
which
we
present
to
you
now.
and
actually,
i
suppose
the
strongest
argument
for
the
interpretation
we
imposes
that
it
makes
common
sense,
it's
just
--
it's
just
as
what
senator
clark
meant.
it's
--
but
what
anyone,
it
doesn't
really
make
any
difference
what
the
nature
of
the
machine
is
whether
it's
called
by
a
lever
or
plunges.
if
it
is
a
gambling
device,
which
they
pay
off
money
on,
it
seems
to
us
obvious
that's
what
congress
intended
to
cover.
so
here
we
are
fortunate
in
having
support
both
from
the
language
of
the
statute
itself,
from
the
legislative
history
and,
as
i
say,
from
just
ordinary
plain
common
sense.
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
upon
the
user
of
the
machine
and
that
is
true,
but
the
rate
of
$250
is
determined
by
the
kind
of
machine.
section
4462
(a)
(2)
refers
to
so-called
slot
machines
which
operate
by
means
of
insertion
of
a
coin,
token
or
similar
object
and
machines
which
by
application
of
the
element
of
chance
may
deliver
or
entitle
a
player
--
player
to
receive
cash
premiums,
merchandize
or
tokens.
this
language
does
not
refer
to
machines,
which
may
be
used
so
that
they
entitle
a
player
to
receive
cash
but
machines
which
do
entitle
a
player
to
receive
cash.
also,
if
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
do
not,
your
honor.
there's
nothing
on
the
machine
which
indicates
that
the
player
is
entitled
to
any
cash
whatsoever.
the
machine
merely
indicates
that
he's
entitled
to
some
free
plays,
whether
the
--
whether
the
location
owner
does
that
or
not
is
a
matter
for
his
own
--
that's
his
own
performance
and
not
that
--
that
is
indicated
by
the
machine
in
any
way.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
it
may
be,
your
honor,
but
we
--
it
raises
some
serious
problems,
i
would
think,
because
if
a
machine
has
--
one
day
is
a
--
a
machine
that
is
to
be
taxed
$10
on
another
day,
it's
a
machine
that's
to
be
taxed
at
$250
depending
upon
what
a
particular
user
does
on
one
day.
i
think
that
that
is
--
introduces
some
serious
problems
in
regard
to
the
enforcement
of
such
a
statute.
furthermore,
if
that
were
true,
any
vending
machine,
a
candy
vending
machine
could
be
made
a
so-called
slot
machine
merely
by
removing
the
candy
brand
identification
labels
on
the
machine
because
that
would
introduce
the
element
of
chance.
he
would
then
have
the
requirement
of
the
insertion
of
a
coin,
the
element
of
chance
because
you
wouldn't
know
what
type
of
candy
bar
you
would
receive
and
you
would
receive
it
properly,
which
would
then
satisfy
the
interpretation
which
the
government
contends
for.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
that
may
be,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
--
that
--
it
would
mean
that
any
type
of
machine
would
be
subject
to
this
tax
and
a
person
who
was
not
exceedingly
learned
in
this,
in
the
law
would
be
a
violator
at
any
time
by
any
--
any
time
by
any
such
innocent
thing
as
that,
removing
the
names
of
the
candy
bars.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
i
believe
that
the
circuit
court
for
this
--
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
has
held
that
such
a
device
is
--
is
not
--
does
not
change
the
character
of
the
slot
machine.
that
same
court
in
its
opinion
also
said
however
that
a
slot
machine
is
a
machine
that
has
an
insignia
on
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
insignia
with
fruit,
and
bells,
and
so
forth.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
has
insignia
on
it
which
--
with
fruit,
and
bells
and
so
forth,
but
that
constitutes
a
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
according
to
that
court,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i'm
not
familiar
with
those,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
it
--
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
justice
whitaker
that
that
phrase
must
be
read
in
connection
with
the
fact
that
the
word
before
it
or
the
subject
to
which
it
--
to
which
the
clause
refers
are
the
machines
themselves
and
they
may
deliver
or
entitle
a
player
to
a
cash.
and
therefore,
that
it
would
be
the
application
of
the
element
of
chance
in
connection
with
the
machine
itself
that
the
machine
itself
would
--
would
be
the
object
that
must
be
looked
to,
not
the
fact
that
two
players
at
the
side
maybe
betting
upon
the
outcome
of
the
machine
for
example.
also,
if
it
could
be
said
that
the
tax
was
upon
the
use
of
the
machine
and
says
the
machine
itself
--
a
question
arises
as
to
whether
the
tax
is
applicable
to
the
misuse
of
the
machine
as
distinguished
from
its
use.
mr.
justice
brennan,
when
government
counsel
was
arguing,
he
asked
about
the
payouts
on
this
machine,
and
the
record
shows
that
this
agent
was
on
the
premises
for
six
hours.
and
apparently,
it's
fairly
clear
from
the
record
that
he
played
the
machine
for
several
of
those
hours
and
that
he
observed
other
people
playing
the
machine
during
that
entire
six-hour
period.
during
that
period,
he
received
the
$1.20
and
another
player
received
$1.
that's
$2.20
cents
in
six
hours.
i'm
referring
to
this
merely
to
show
that
this
is
not
at
all
like
a
slot
machine.
a
slot
machine
would
deliver
$2.20
cents
in
a
period
of
a
few
minutes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
i
mean
that
this
is
an
amusement
game
that
people
are
not
there
to
collect
money
there.
they're
there
to
enjoy
themselves
by
operating
the
machine.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
would
think
it
would
be.
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
true.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
the
question
which
i've
been
a
little
bit
concerned
about
when
reading
the
treasury
regulations
which
the
government
refers
to.
two
examples
are
given
in
those
treasury
regulations.
one
is
a
pinball
game
which
refunds
free
plays
and
cash.
the
second
refers
to
what
i
believe
we
would
call
a
one-armed
bandit
regardless
of
whether
it
pays
out
or
not.
now,
i
believe
that
that
second
example
given
in
the
regulation
is
clearly
erroneous
because
the
statute
itself
says
that
the
--
not
only
must
the
machine
be
a
slot
machine
but
it
must
require
the
insertion
of
a
coin,
the
application
of
chance
and
the
payout
of
money
or
property.
therefore,
i
will
argue
that
both
those
examples
are
erroneous.
and
since
the
second
one
is
clearly
so,
there's
no
reason
why
the
--
the
first
one
isn't
equally
so.
the
--
now,
to
answer
your
question,
whether
a
slot
machine,
which
only
paid
out
$2.20
cents
would
come
outside
the
$250
hard
tax.
i
believe
it
would
not
but
it
is
still
a
slot
machine.
however,
when
we're
talking
about
the
machines
in
this
case
which
are
not
one-armed
bandit
slot
machines,
we
then
must
--
i
believe
the
government
--
the
government
might
show
that
these
are
at
least
so
similar
to
one-armed
bandits
that
they
could
fall
into
that
--
into
that
category.
and
the
fact
that
they
pay
out
this
infrequently,
it
doesn't
mean
that
they're
--
the
chances
are
that
much
less,
but
merely
that
the
people
play
off
the
games.
they
don't
ask
for
the
money.
in
this
case,
the
agent
himself
won
some
games.
he
played
off
so
many
and
received
cash
for
some.
the
lady
who
testified
in
behalf
of
the
united
states,
the
patron
testified
that
she
had
won
a
certain
number
of
games.
she
played
off
some
of
them
and
then
when
she's
tired
of
that,
she
asked
for
the
dollar
that
she
had.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
still,
all
of
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
that's
correct
but
that,
yet,
in
every
case
it
must
be
a
slot
machine
and
that
a
slot
machine
--
a
one-armed
bandit
type
slot
machine
that
may
or
may
not
pay
out
or
entitle
the
person
to
receive
cash
would
be
within
this
$250
category.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
language
i
think
itself,
but
in
addition
to
that,
i
think
the
legislative
history
is
--
is
fairly
conclusive.
the
original
bill
that
was
proposed
provided
for
a
single
tax
for
$25
on
two
categories
of
machines.
and
the
two
categories
were
set
out
as
so-called
pinball
machines
and
so-called
slot
machines.
then,
after
hearings
were
held,
it
was
decided
to
differentiate
the
tax
and
put
a
$10
tax
on
pinball
games
and
a
$50
tax
on
slot
machines.
and
that
was
the
way
the
statute
was
originally
enacted
with
two
categories,
one
relating
to
pinball
games
and
one
to
slot
machines
with
the
two
different
taxes.
and
in
1942,
when
the
tax
was
amended,
what
congress
did
according
to
the
language
of
the
reports
that
were
issued
by
the
congressional
committees
who
considered
the
matter
was
to
broaden
the
$10
category
to
include
other
amusement
devices
such
as
music
machines
and
gun
games
and
other
types
of
games
that
would
be
found
in
a
--
what
used
to
be
called
penny
arcades.
those
reports
by
the
congressional
committee
has
indicated
that
--
and
i'm
quoting,
“under
this
amendment,
there
will
be
included
in
addition
to
pinball
machines
a
great
variety
of
other
machines
such
as
baseball
and
football
games,
machinegun
games,
music
machine,
so-called
jukeboxes,
and
many
other
types.”
so
that
--
at
that
point,
congress
was
broadening
that
category
to
include
other
games
but
keeping
pinball
games
in
the
$10
category
which
was
mutually
exclusive
from
the
so-called
slot
machine
category
$250.
the
treasury
regulation
which
was
adopted
originally
in
1942
as
the
court
of
appeals
states,
i
think
correctly
that
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
statute.
in
addition
to
that,
the
tax
returns,
which
appear
on
pages
94
and
95
of
the
record,
indicate
that
the
government
up
until
1952
and
the
1952
date
is
a
date,
which
was
testified
to
by
one
of
the
government's
witnesses.
up
until
1952,
the
tax
returns
stated,
“coin-operated
amusement
devices,
pinball
and
all
other
amusement
or
music
machines
$10
each
and
coin-operated
gaming
devices
slot
machines
and
all
other
machines,
$100
each.”
that
was
before
the
change
was
made
to
$250.
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
as
long
as
pinball
games
are
in
the
other
category,
they
cannot
be
in
the
second
one
also.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
--
i
think
that
it
can
be
said
that
when
you
read
the
--
the
only
thing
you
will
have
the
opportunity
to
do
is
read
the
description
of
these
games.
if
you
will
see
that
they
are
typical
pinball
games
that
--
this
isn't
a
special
kind
of
a
pinball
game.
this
is
the
kind
of
pinball
game
that
everyone
recognizes.
now,
if
a
person
must
have
a
--
a
patent
lawyer
to
determine
whether
a
pinball
game
is
one
kind
or
another
kind
involving
a,
well,
more
of
a
patent
lawyer
or
an
engineer
or
someone
who
can
determine
at
every
point
whether
this
involves
an
element
or
chance
--
of
chance
or
not,
it
would
result
in
a,
i
would
think
a
chaotic
situation
in
regard
to
the
proper
enforcement
of
this
tax.
also
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
true
and
also
must
be
a
slot
machine,
which
i
think
to
support
an
element.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
believe
that's
a
case
where
congress
may
say
something
in
a
general
manner
and
if
enough
people
say
that
they
think
there's
a
question
as
to
whether
their
particular
activity
is
covered
or
not,
it's
very
possible
that
congress
will
cover
that
specifically
even
though
it's
been
covered
generally
in
the
statute
itself.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
--
at
that
time,
the
statute
had
recently
been
enacted.
i
suppose
everyone
was
afraid
that
anything
could
happen.
but
after
1942,
it
was
another
13
or
14
years
before
--
apparently,
there
was
any
enforcement
of
this
statute
even
against
pinball
games
that
pay
off
in
money.
and
i
say
that
because
not
only
it's
the
first
time
it
has
come
to
this
court,
this
issue,
but
also
--
and
the
statute
has
been
in
effect
since
1941.
no
court
of
appeals
ever
passed
upon
it.
yet,
today,
the
government
says,
“we
have
confiscated
500
machines.
we
have
14,000
machines
that
are
paying
this
tax,”
because
there
are
many
people
involved.
i
submit
that
there
would
have
been
some
adjudication
to
this
issue
before
today
if
that
statute
had
been
enforced
against
pinball
games
that
pay
off
money.
also,
in
the
drive
to
--
the
counsel
says
there's
one
inconsistent
ruling.
there
are
few
others
that
tend
to
support
this
conclusion
we
reached
on
pages
89
and
90
of
the
record.
and
also
the
government
hasn't
produced
any
rulings
which
are
contrary
to
the
so-called
inconsistent
interpretation
and
i
assume
that
there
are
any
such
rulings
that
they
would
have
had
accessed
to
them
and
produced
them.
in
regard
to
the
question
about
skill,
and
whether
there
is
any
skill
or
chance
or
whether
one
predominates
over
the
other
in
any
of
these
machines,
i
suppose
we
would
all
agree
that
you
can't
find
the
machine
outside
of
one-armed
bandit
that
doesn't
have
some
element
of
chance
and
some
element
of
skill.
in
this
case,
the
government
witnesses
testified
this
patron
who
was
in
the
resort
testified
that
she
thought
she
was
able
to
use
a
skill
to
determine
the
result
to
some
extent.
the
agent
himself
who
came
in
and
demanded
the
tax
contended
--
admitted
on
--
on
cross-examination
that
by
operating
the
plunger
in
a
certain
way
by
nudging
the
machine,
it
was
possible
to
affect
the
result.
even
the
manufacturer
of
a
competing
machine
made
that
admission
that
there
was
skill
involved
in
this
particular
machine.
although,
if
you
obviously
would
--
since
he
was
a
competitor,
he
would
have
the
inclination
to
say
otherwise
that
he
possibly
could.
in
my
conclusion,
i
think
that
the
statutory
language
may
not
be
as
clear
as
one
side
or
the
other
would
wish.
i
think
it
is
clear
enough
to
indicate
and
certainly
more
clearer
in
regard
to
supporting
the
interpretation
placed
upon
that
language
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
on
the
opposite
contention.
a
legislative
history
supports
that
language
and
there's
nothing
in
the
--
outside
of
these
two
tests
that
should
change
the
result
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
have
nothing
to
add,
your
honor.
