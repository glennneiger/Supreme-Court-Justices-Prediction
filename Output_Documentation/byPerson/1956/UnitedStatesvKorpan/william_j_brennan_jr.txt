justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
understand
mr.
davis
what
you
mean
changing
the
odds,
the
odds
under
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what's
that
mean,
if
you
have
five
replays
on
which
after
you
get
50
cents
or
something
like
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
was
it
before
you
play
the
game
instead
of
putting
just
one
dime,
you
may
put
in
two
or
three
dimes?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
--
on
the
one
play.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
one
play.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
how
--
how
is
the
paid
off,
is
it
more
often
cash
than
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it's
a
dollar
--
a
dollar
and
twenty,
in
effect.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
the
government's
position
in
any
event,
it's
that
that
the
slot
machine
--
it's
immaterial
whether
it's
a
game
of
chance
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what
--
what
was
this
alternative,
instead
of
paying
out
cash
just
to
allow
the
player
in
a
certain
number
of
free
games?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
free
games?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
would
that
bring
outside
the
act
of
one-armed
bandit
without
--
it's
delivered
only
$2.20
cents
in
six
hours
of
play?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
of
course,
the
statutory
language
though
is,
may
deliver
or
entitle.
i
suppose,
may
modified
some
title
through
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
or
may
entitle
the
person
playing
to
receive
cash.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean,
he's
entitled
to
test
not
whether
in
fact,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
your
argument
in
any
event
is
that
so-called
slot
machine
means
only
one-armed
bandits.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
on
what
do
you
--
what
do
you
support
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it's
--
and
all
other
machines
involving
element
of
chance.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
even
though
they
involved
an
element
of
chance?
first
line
doesn't
seem
to
have
any
reference
to
any
--
can
borrow
other
machine
involving
the
element
of
chance,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
it's
in
this
two
found
tests
though,
it
must
involve
not
only
an
element
of
chance
but
also
that
it
delivers
or
entitles
the
player
to
cash,
a
premium
or
something
else.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
you
do
with
the
--
the
government's
argument
derived
from
that
1942
amendment
on
the
1-cent
vending
machine?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
the
1-cent
vending
machine
companies
must
have
been
afraid
that
they
might
come
within
slot
machine,
must
they
not,
to
ask
special
provision
for
themselves?
