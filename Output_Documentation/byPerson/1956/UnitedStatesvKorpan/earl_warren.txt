mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
we
have
two
or
three
minutes.
you
might
as
well
proceed
mr.
sprecher.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
you
just
took
the
arm
or
the
one-armed
bandit
and
used
an
electric
button
that
would
propel
a
bar
or
something
to
start
it.
would
that
change
the
character
of
the
machine
to
such
an
extent
that
it
wouldn't
be
taxable?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
has
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that's
the
only
time
the
one-armed
bandit
is
--
is
recognized?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
about
this
--
these
other
ones
that
are
more
orthodox
than
that,
that
were
in
existence
with
the
old
duty
machines
to
--
not
to
name
of
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
maybe.[laughter]
do
you
mean
--
do
you
mean
that
by
--
by
that
that
--
that
there's
so
little
chance
of
winning
on
this
kind
of
an
operation
that
it
can't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
reasonably
be
called
a
gambling
chance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
you
mean
to
say
that
taking
this
by
and
large
and
nationwide
that
the
income
from
games
of
this
kind
would
be
de
minimis?
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
there
any
further,
mr.
davis?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
