mr.
robert
a.
sprecher
mr.
chief
justice
and
your
honors,
looking
at
the
language
of
the
statute
first,
section
4462
(a)
(2)
speaks
of
the
so-called
"slot
machines"
which
are
taxed
at
the
rate
of
$250.
now,
this
can
mean
only
one
of
two
things.
it
can
either
be
a
machine
with
any
type
of
coin
slot
or
it
must
mean
a
one-armed
bandit.
it
cannot
--
there's
no
third
meaning,
those
are
the
only
two
possibilities.
now,
if
it
means
a
machine
that
merely
has
the
coin
slot,
then
the
words
which
followed
it
immediately
which
state
--
which
operate
by
means
of
the
insertion
of
a
coin,
token,
or
similar
object
would
be
entirely
redundant
and
unnecessary.
so
that
--
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
entirely
correct
in
holding
that
the
meaning
to
be
applied
to
this
language,
these
words
is
the
meaning
--
the
second
meaning
of
a
one-armed
bandit.
the
government
counsel
speaks
of
common
sense
in
approaching
this
problem.
i
think
that
we
could
all
have
enough
judicial
knowledge
of
these
types
of
games
to
know
that
there
are
pinball
games
and
there
are
slot
machines
and
they
are
two
different
devices.
the
--
i
think
actually,
the
government
is
contending
that
there
are
--
there's
--
there
is
some
kind
of
a
third
meaning
which
relates
to
the
use
of
the
machine.
in
other
words,
the
machine
can
be
a
slot
machine
that
was
used
in
one
way.
