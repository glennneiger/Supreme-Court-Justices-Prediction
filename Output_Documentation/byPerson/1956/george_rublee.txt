mr.
rublee
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
rublee
the
government's
position
that
this
case
is
analogous
to
the
stroud
case,
their
argument
that
it
is
essentially
unfair
for
petitioner
here
to
claimed
that
an
acquittal
survived
to
the
appeal,
their
argument
to
dismiss
the
murder
charge
absolutely
here
would
make
the
court
a
place
for
a
game
rather
than
a
place
for
the
--
to
the
justice
that
this
was
a
tricky
thing.
all
of
these
arguments
rest
on
their
assumption
as
to
what
went
wrong
in
the
minds
of
the
jurors
at
the
first
trial.
they
are
speculating
about
the
jurors
when
mr.
sand
says
that
the
jury
found
that
mr.
green
has
killed
ms.
brown
at
the
--
in
the
perpetration
of
the
arson,
he
is
speculating
and
his
speculation
was
not
shared
by
the
court
of
appeals
when
it
reversed
that
second
degree
of
conviction.
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
shared
mr.
sand's
certainty
as
to
what
went
wrong
in
the
minds
of
the
jury,
they
would
have
been
reversing
solely
for
the
benefit
of
the
government.
mr.
sand's
argument
that
green
claiming
his
course
of
conduct,
constituted
first
degree
murder
and
that
his
second
degree
of
conviction
should
be
set
aside
because
of
that.
ignores
what
the
court
of
appeals
held.
they
held
that
the
second
degree
charge
was
not
an
invitation
to
the
jury
to
compromise
so
much
as
it
was
an
invitation
for
the
jury
to
convict
mr.
green
of
a
crime
which
he
hadn't
committed,
a
crime
for
which
there
was
no
evidence
in
that
record.
now,
that
is
perhaps
a
delicate
question.
just
what
exactly
was
on
this
charge?
what
could
it
signify?
i
should
like
to
read
to
the
court,
part
of
the
charge
given
at
the
first
trial.
the
statute
means
that
if
a
person
kills
another
in
the
perpetration
of
an
arson
or
attempting
to
perpetrate
an
arson,
the
killing
is
murder
in
the
first
degree.
under
such
circumstances,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
killing
was
committed
with
or
without
purpose
so
to
do.
any
killing
even
if
committed
without
any
purpose
so
to
do,
even
if
it
is
accidental
and
it
is
committed
in
perpetrating
an
arson
is
murder
in
the
first
degree
under
the
law.
that
charge
--
then
there
was
a
second
degree
charge
which
just
said
if
you
find
that
he
killed
her
without
premeditation,
he
may
return
a
verdict
to
second
degree.
but,
there
had
been
a
serious
challenge
to
the
manner
of
ms.
brown's
death
raised
by
defense
counsel
at
the
first
trial.
the
government
has
not
produced
the
doctor
who
made
the
test
of
ms.
brown's
blood
and
upon
that
blood
test,
rested
the
government's
point
that
ms.
brown
had
died
as
a
result
of
the
fire.
the
prosecuting
attorney
took
this
attack
on
their
testimony
at
the
first
trial,
seriously
enough
to
call
this
witness
at
the
second
trial.
he
believed
that
he
should
proceed
against
green
with
this
witness.
if
we
--
if
this
court
is
to
speculate
about
what
went
on
in
the
minds
of
the
jurors,
we
think
it
is
not
to
be
disregarded
that
they
might
have
felt.
we
don't
know
how
green
killed
ms.
brown.
we
can't
tell.
the
defense
attorney
certainly
made
a
fuss
about
whether
or
not
the
government
can
prove
she
inhaled
smoke
and
died.
and
the
judge
told
us
if
we
thought
she
died
in
the
fire
that
we
had
to
return
first
degree,
but
there
were
the
two
of
them
in
that
house
and
one
of
them
was
dead
and
the
other
one
we
feel
committed
arson
and
we
feel
he
told
us
a
lie
about
an
intruder
coming
in
and
stabbing
him
with
an
ice
pick.
so
--
and
also,
he
is
on
trial
for
killing
her.
there
must
be
something
in
that.
we
don't
know
how
he
did
it,
but
we
can
just
find
him
guilty
of
second
degree.
the
judge
told
us
if
we
thought
he
killed
her
and
didn't
mean
to
do
it,
it
wasn't
premeditated,
that's
second
degree.
well,
that's
the
speculation
that's
possible.
we're
getting
to
a
great
deal
of
trouble
when
we
start
to
speculate.
i
should
like
to
also
comment
a
bit
about
the
idea
that
this
charge
was
very
unfair
to
the
government.
the
prosecuting
attorney
sat
on
his
hands
when
the
second
degree
charge
went
to
the
jury.
in
fact,
in
his
summation
to
jury,
he
told
them
that
second
degree
charge
will
be
given.
now,
if
this
court
holds
that
by
appealing
that
erroneous
lesser
conviction,
green's
subjected
himself
properly
to
retrial
on
the
greater
charge.
you
are
creating
a
lovely
situation
for
prosecutors
in
difficult
cases.
we
submit
the
prosecutor
let
the
second
degree
charge
go
to
the
jury
because
he
was
afraid
that
jury
might
not
convict
on
first
degree.
this
was
a
rather
sympathetic
defendant.
and
we
submit
that
if
you
hold
the
way
the
government
wishes
you
to
hold
in
this
case,
you
will
leave
prosecutors
in
the
driver
seat.
they
can
let
the
lesser
erroneous
charge
go
to
the
jury
securing
a
knowledge
that
they
will
get
a
conviction
or
they
have
a
better
chance
of
getting
a
conviction,
otherwise,
they
wouldn't
let
it
go.
and
if
they
--
if
the
defendant
is
rush
enough
to
appeal
that
conviction,
the
government
will
have
another
chance
adding
on
the
greater
charge
which
they
couldn't
prove
for
which
they
had
enough
doubt
about
so
that
they
let
the
lesser
go
to
the
jury.
now,
sure
there
was
a
benefit
to
green
in
a
way
from
the
second
degree
charge,
we
don't
deny
that.
it
is
possible
that
the
government's
speculation
maybe
true
in
fact
although
improper
as
a
matter
of
procedure.
but
who
is
to
bear
the
burden
in
a
situation
like
this,
the
defendant
or
the
state?
you
are
faced
to
that
choice.
mr.
rublee
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
rublee
well,
we
do
think
that
this
is
a
difficult
situation.
it's
not
one
that
it's
frequently
going
to
come
up,
but
what
i
have
said
about
other
cases
applies
and
enforced
here.
now,
there
was
another
policy
argument
by
the
government
that
green
argued
his
cause.
they
--
they
mentioned
the
ali
recommendation
and
the
ali
recommendation
contained
some
remarkable
language.
it
says
when
a
defendant
procures
a
reversal
of
the
lesser
conviction
because
his
course
of
conduct
constituted
the
greater.
well,
that
is
extraordinary.
that
is
though
as
i've
said
earlier
green
had
gone
into
the
court
of
appeals
and
said,
“you
haven't
punished
me
enough
and
i'm
curious
and
i
want
a
new
trial,”
of
which
he
did
not
do.
it
assumes
that
the
jury
must
have
interpreted
the
charge
to
be
an
invitation
to
return
as
trial
verdict.
mr.
rublee
the
court
of
appeals
was
urged
to
reverse
by
mr.
blow
because
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
sustain
the
second
degree
conviction
and
also
because
the
second
degree
instruction
prejudiced
green
and
let
the
jury
abandon
their
inquiry
as
to
how
ms.
brown
died.
the
jury
was
invited
not
to
worry
about
the
manner
of
ms.
brown's
death
by
the
second
degree
charge
and
that
is
essentially
what
the
court
of
appeals
held.
they
held
that
without
a
second
degree
charge,
green
might
have
been
entirely
free.
mr.
rublee
we
agree
with
you,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
but
there
was
this
possibility
and
i
don't
know
what
the
law
on
this
would
be
because
it
is
not
exactly
our
case,
but
had
the
government
had
good
evidence
of
second
degree
which
they
didn't
put
in.
it
is
not
absolutely
clear
in
my
mind
that
they
might
not
have
been
able
to
prosecute
on
second
degree.
mr.
rublee
we
agree.
mr.
rublee
but
that
is
--
mr.
rublee
that
is
not
this
case.
this
case,
the
prosecutor
was
insufficiently
sure
that
he
had
put
on
enough
so
that
he
allow
the
second
degree
charge
to
go
to
the
jury.
we
submit
that
if
he
had
been
absolutely
confident
in
this
case,
he
would
have
insisted
that
first
degree
charge
only
goes
to
the
jury
and
--
mr.
rublee
the
prosecutor?
no,
mr.
justice
clark,
he
did
not.
he
sat
by,
we
say
on
his
hand.
mr.
rublee
the
record
does
not
show
any
discussion
about
the
second
degree
charge,
mr.
justice
clark.
it
just
shows
that
both
counsel
for
the
government,
the
prosecutor
and
the
counsel
for
green
held
the
jury
in
their
summations
that
the
judge
would
be
charging
the
jury
on
second
degree
as
well
as
on
first
degree.
and
the
judge
did
so.
mr.
rublee
they
were
not
very
formally
delivered.
the
transcript
of
the
first
trial
shows
that
the
judge
charged
over
a
long
period
of
time.
he
did
not
read
a
specific
paragraph
that
has
been
drafted
before
him
by
counsel.
mr.
rublee
the
record
does
not
(voice
overlap)
does
not
show
that
and
neither
mr.
blow
or
myself
presenting
the
case
and
we
do
not
know
this
your
honor,
as
to
who
initiated
the
idea
of
second
degree.
one
more
thing
about
the
stroud
case,
there
you
do
have
a
specific
brief
of
guilty
of
a
capital
crime
and
an
express
recommendation
of
less
than
capital
punishment.
but
you're
not
there
required
to
interpret
as
silenced
on
the
capital
charge
and
a
specific
verdict
of
less
than
the
capital
crime
with
a
verdict
of
guilty
of
the
capital
charge.
mr.
rublee
no,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
it's
not
--
but
there,
you're
not
tampering
with
what
the
jury
found.
you're
not
speculating
to
what
the
jury
had
in
mind
as
to
the
man's
guilt.
you
are
--
mr.
rublee
well,
we
agree
mr.
justice
frankfurter
but
we
do
point
--
mr.
rublee
that's
the
stroud
case.
it
is
not
the
green
case
though.
the
--
the
green
case,
you
have
to
go
further
than
stroud
and
you
have
to
assume
that
you
know
that
the
jury
found
mr.
green
guilty
of
killing
ms.
brown
and
perpetrating
arson.
mr.
rublee
well,
they
specifically
said
that
they
weren't
passing
on
the
trono
point,
i
believe
on
stroud.
mr.
rublee
they
said
(voice
overlap)
--
they
said
the
jeopardy
did
not
attach
to
punishment.
they
distinguished
--
mr.
rublee
if
there
are
no
further
questions
--
