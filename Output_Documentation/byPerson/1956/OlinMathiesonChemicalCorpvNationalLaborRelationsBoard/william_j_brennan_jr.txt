justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
was
that
done,
by
a
general
notice
or
just
to
--
to
those
who
returned?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
mean,
this
advised
to
those
who
returned
before
the
main
body
of
workers
that
they
would
have
a
permanent
status.
was
that
told
to
them
at
the
time
they
came
back?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
the
first
notice
of
this
was
on
the
occasion
of
the
collective
bargaining
for
the
new
agreement
subsequently
for
the
return
of
everyone.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
ahead
of
everyone
else?
you
say
it
was
assumed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
of
course
is
whether
--
is
there
anything
in
this
record
which
justifies
an
inference
that
one
of
the
inducements
to
get
these
seven
or
whatever
the
number
may
be
to
come
back
in
advance
of
the
large
body,
was
that
they
would,
by
coming
back,
get
preferential
status
seniority
wise?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
stuart,
i
gather
then
that
you're
asking
us
to
say
that
actually,
in
legal
consequence,
what
was
done
here
does
not
differ
from
a
situation
in
which
rather
than
seven
strikers
coming
in
and
taking
those
jobs,
you
had
employed
seven
new
men.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
would
you
tell
me
this,
mr.
stuart,
if
i
may
refer
you
back
to
what
mr.
justice
black
was
just
reading
for
you.
does
mackay
hold
anything
like
this
if
this
had
read
so
as
to
give
preference
to
new
employees
hired
during
the
strike
in
order
to
discipline
employees
adhering
to
the
strike?d
oes
mackay
say
anything
like
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
well
now,
but
look
at
the
difference.
the
words
i
substitute
in
the
sentence
that
mr.
justice
black
read
to
you
would
make
a
breach
you
see,
so
as
to
give
a
--
give
preference
to
employees
hired
during
the
strike,
not
in
order
to
carry
on
the
business
but
according
to
the
finding
of
the
board,
in
order
to
discipline
employees
adhering
to
the
strike.
that
was
the
board's
finding.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
now
if
--
how
--
how
do
you
get
over
that?
how
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
other
than
as
mr.
justice
black
suggests,
so
you're
asking
us
now
to
say
that
the
evidence
didn't
support
that
finding.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
think
as
i
--
am
i
correct
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
am
i
correct
that
mackay
in
point
of
time
concern
the
right
of
the
employer,
in
other
words,
the
charge
was
that
he
had
replaced
strikers
in
an
effort
to
carry
on
this
business
and
that
that
was
an
unfair
labor
practice.
and
all
this
court
said
was
that
was
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
your
view
in
your
case
however,
as
i
understand
it,
the
action
at
which
--
your
action
at
which
the
complaint
was
directed
is
your
action
as
subsequent
to
the
strike
in
relation
to
the
--
according
at
that
time
as
the
board
found
at
least
for
the
purpose
of
punishing
these
other
strikers
who
didn't
come
back.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
tell
me,
mr.
stuart,
if
there
had
been
no
strike
and
the
union
and
the
company
had
not
been
able
to
agree
on
a
renewal
agreement.
during
the
hiatus
before
they
agreed
on
and
after
the
termination
date,
would
there
had
been
no
applicable
seniority
policy
on
that
plant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
this,
mr.
stuart?
sorry
to
interrupt
so
often.
has
there
--
was
there
any
formal
announcement
at
anytime
by
this
employer
that
the
--
in
addition
or
when
the
contract
expired
by
its
terms,
was
anything
said
after
that
that
the
old
contract
seniority
shall
not
apply
or
otherwise
any
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
nothing
of
that
kind.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
rely
on
the
mere
fact
of
termination
of
the
agreement
as
importing
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
thereafter,
there
was
no
seniority?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
but
i
--
i
guess
this
is
an
actual
--
i'm
looking
at
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
at
page
30
in
which
this
is
quoted
from
potlatch.
"in
the
instant
case,
therefore,
the
discrimination
between
replacements
and
strikers
is
not
an
unfair
labor
practice,
it's
quite
a
tendency
discouraging
an
activity
because
the
benefit
conferred
upon
the
replacements
is
a
benefit
reasonably
appropriate
for
the
employer
to
confer
in
attempting
to
protect
the
continuous
business
and
so
forth."
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
that
a
very
different
finding
in
the
one
that
was
found
here
that
this
finding
being,
that
what
was
done
was
an
order
to
discipline
employees?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
about
this
mr.
stuart,
is
this
an
accurate
summarization
of
at
least
one
fact
in
the
record
that
olin's
--
i'm
looking
at
page
29.
"olin's
attorney,
stull,
admitted
in
one
of
the
conferences
with
union
representative
that
olin's
insistence
on
that
superseniority
plan
was
motivated
by
olin's
preference
for
the
employees
who
had
been
loyal
to
olin
by
helping
to
break
the
strike,
and
also
olin's
concern
that
the
plant
be
not
shutdown
again."
is
that
accurate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
â€“-
i'm
trying
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
seem
to
me
that
there
must
have
been
rather
--
if
that's
accurate,
that
law
of
it
or
if
its
standing
alone
support
this
finding
that
the
whole
purpose
of
what
was
done
was
in
order
to
discipline
employees
adhering
to
the
strike.
