but
the
board
drew
--
drew
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
board
drew
it
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
wasn't
--
wasn't
there
a
year,
a
purposeful
classification
as
to
seniority
rights,
purposefully
disadvantaging
those
who
had
been
out
on
strike
--
not
as
an
inevitable
consequences
--
consequence
of
making
replacement
but
designed
to
have
those
fellows
remember.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wasn't
the
operation
--
the
inevitable
operation
of
hiring
people
to
replace
people
on
strike
and
hiring
people
who
would
then
obtain
permanent
tenure.
that's
one
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
typical
aspects
of
a
strike,
but
that
has
been
held
not
to
be,
as
i
understand
it,
an
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
--
are
you
urging
on
this
court
the
proposition
that
although
the
board
made
a
finding
that
there
was
this
conscious
discrimination
after
the
strike
was
over
with
a
view
of
inflicting
that
kind
of
disadvantage
to
those
who
had
been
on
strike
that
that's
what
the
board
found.
are
you
urging
there
was
no
basis
for
that
finding
and
no
basis
for
the
court
of
appeals
in
sustaining
that
finding
or
finding
that
finding
sufficiently
sustained
for
them
to
require
to
be
respected,
are
you
--
are
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix

mr.
stuart
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
stuart,
there
was
another
part
of
the
decision
in
the
mackay
case.
namely,
the
court
found
that
the
board
was
justified
in
finding
that
in
taking
back
the
people,
they
discriminated
against
those
who
were
the
most
active
in
the
union
activity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
as
i
understand
this
decision
and
regarding
this
on
this,
that's
what
the
board
found
in
this
case
with
reference
to
the
layoff,
references
of
seniority
rights.
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
the
seniority
right.
it's
found
that
in
fact,
it
found
--
i
don't
see
how
a
discrimination
is
other
than
an
ascertainment
of
fact
whether
you
discriminate
or
not,
must
be
an
ascertainment
of
--
call
it
what
you
will,
a
conclusion
by
the
board
on
the
record
that
they
aimed
at
people
who
are
particularly
aggressive
in
the
strike.
now,
i
can
well
understand,
of
course
i
can
understand
you
to
maintain
that
there
isn't
a
shred
of
support
for
any
such
conclusion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that's
an
--
that's
an
arbitrary,
then
it
becomes
no
finding,
it
becomes
a
dogmatic
assertion.
is
that
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
irrespective
of
the
finding
of
motivation,
how
can
you
--
how
can
you
put
that
aside
to
be
irrelevant?
that's
what
discrimination
involves
normally,
motive.
i
mean
that's
what
--
that's
what
discrimination
means
that
you
prefer
between
--
that's
your
purpose
or
motive
or
call
it
what
you
will.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
--
i
understand
the
argument
that
the
board
was
just
entitled
to
find
it
as
a
matter
of
law,
i
understand
that.
