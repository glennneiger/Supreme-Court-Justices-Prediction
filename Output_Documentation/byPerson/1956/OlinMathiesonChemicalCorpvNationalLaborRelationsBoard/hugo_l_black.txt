well,
that's
what
--
isn't
that
what
the
court
--
the
basis
on
which
the
court
acted
and
that
was
what
the
board
had
found
that
they
did
do
it
for
the
purpose
of
granting
a
property?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
i
don't
quite
understand.
what's
meant
by
the
statement
on
page
26?
is
it
this
case
or
some
other
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
right
here
on
the
second
part
of
it.
well,
it
said
judge
dobie.
judge
dobie
said
whether
the
question
presented
all,
whether
the
board
has
properly
found
that
the
company
violated
section
8
(a)
(3)
so
forth
by
changing
its
seniority
policy
after
a
strike
to
give
preference
to
nonstrikers
and
to
employees
that
return
to
work.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
he
mean
by
saying
"always
does
not
dispute
the
fact,
promulgation
and
implementation
of
its
superseniority
policy
was
discriminatory
in
favor
of
employees
abandoning
or
not
participating
in
the
strike
--
justice
hugo
l.

against
those
remaining
on
strike
until
it
called
out."

justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
olin
did
promulgate
and
implement
its
superseniority
policy
to
accomplish
that
purpose.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
he
added
not
as
all
and
denied
that
its
action
discouraged
union
activities.
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
it
felt.
justice
hugo
l.
black
judge
dobie
said
all
and
then
denied.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
didn't
say
lose
a
strike,
if
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
the
olin
adopted
a
policy
and
put
it
in
effect
for
that
purpose.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
say
that
--
i
--
i'd
like
to
find
out
if
i'm
wrong
about
it.
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
asking
the
court
to
say
that
the
trial
examiner,
the
board
and
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
were
wrong
in
approving
this
finding
which
judge
dobie
states
on
page
20c.
the
board
found
an
agreement
with
the
trial
examiner
that
olin
changed
its
seniority
policy
after
the
strike
so
as
to
give
preference
to
employees
who
had
worked
during
the
strike
in
order
to
discipline
the
employees
adhering
to
the
strike,
went
at
the
very
end
and
that
olin's
action
in
this
regard
and
its
further
action
pursuant
to
its
new
policy
of
laying
off
all
seven
employees
would
be
violative
of
section
8
(a)
(3).
and
how
could
we
hold
the
view
unless
we
disagree
with
the
findings
of
the
trial
examiner,
findings
of
the
board
as
approved
by
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
do
you
do
about
this
finding?
is
this
finding
right
or
wrong?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why,
because
it's
not
supported
by
the
facts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
supported
by
the
evidence.
so
what
you're
presenting
here,
we
overturn
the
findings
made
by
the
trial
examiner,
approved
by
the
board,
and
then
approved
by
the
court
of
appeals.
we
have
to,
don't
we,
if
we
--
in
order
to
get
away
from
that
finding.
justice
hugo
l.
black
page
28?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
difference
does
that
make?
is
--
can
--
can
an
unfair
labor
practice
be
excused
by
saying
it
occurred
after
a
strike?
in
other
words,
suppose
--
or
--
or
you
would
come
here
and
admit
to
us
just
what's
in
here
and
say
"yes,
we
setup
this
program.
it
was
after
the
strike,
however.
and
we
did
it
for
the
purpose
of
disciplining
these
men
on
the
strike
and
to
keep
them
from
doing
that
in
the
future."
would
that
be
a
violation
of
the
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
say
--
if
--
suppose
you
said
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
would
that
be
a
violation
of
the
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right
and
they
say
you
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
judge
dobie
didn't
so
treat
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
referred
to
the
trial
examiner.
didn't
he
specifically
and
pointedly
find
that
this
discharge
laid
off
seven
employees
discriminatorily
pursuant
to
his
discriminatory
seniority
policy
put
into
effect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
are
you
reading?
justice
hugo

black
page
41,
on
the
first
part.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
were
the
findings
in
the
potlatch
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
there
be
a
--
how
could
there
be
a
conflict
unless
it's
on
--
it's
when
--
when
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
so
far
as
the
evidence
is
concerned
to
support
the
findings.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
it
be
the
same?
the
question
here
is,
they've
found,
that
your
people
did
this
for
the
purpose
of
discriminating
against
these
people
and
put
in
the
policy
with
any
such
purpose.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
overturned
your
findings
but
that's
on
the
evidence
before
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
is
quite
different
evidence,
how
could
there
be
a
conflict?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
our
universal
camera
decision
has
any
relation
to
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
that
case,
we've
indicated
pretty
strongly,
doesn't
it,
that
the
court
of
appeals
starts
first
responsibility
and
only
in
the
most
exceptional
circumstances
when
we
attempt
to
read
all
the
evidence
to
overturn
the
finding?
