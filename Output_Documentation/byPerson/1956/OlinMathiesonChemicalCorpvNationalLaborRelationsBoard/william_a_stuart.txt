mr.
william
a.
stuart
may
it
please
the
court.
and
if
the
court
will
find
that
there's
no
material
conflict
in
the
facts
in
this
case.
the
question
involved
as
to
whether
strikers,
even
though
nonstrikers
who
come
back
to
work
during
the
strike
and
before
the
union
has
ordered
back
the
body,
the
main
body
of
the
strikers,
to
come
back
and
are
reinstated
in
their
permanent
tenure
whether
they
must
be
replaced
or
displaced
in
order
to
make
run
for
the
strikers
who
strike
it
out
until
the
union
ordered
them
back.
that
is
the
prerogative
question
involved
as
to
the
effect,
if
any,
of
length
of
service
upon
the
employees
involved
here,
to
the
effect
particularly
of
some
of
the
employees
who
stuck
it
out
to
the
end
having
greater
length
of
service
than
the
any
employees
who
abandoned
the
strike
and
came
back
and
were
reinstated
in
a
permanent
tenure
while
the
others
were
still
there.
now,
what
happened
in
the
case
was
that
this
employer
which
operates
the
plant
at
morgantown,
west
virginia,
a
chemical
plant,
made
a
study
of
the
maintenance
work
with
the
view
to
determining
why
it
was
costing
more
than
it
seemed
it
should
cost.
as
a
result
of
that
study,
reorganization
of
the
maintenance
department
was
determined
upon
involving
a
reduction
in
force
of
94
of
the
maintenance
employees.
however,
before
the
layoff
list
could
be
prepared
and
the
layoff
made,
the
strike
intervened.
the
maintenance
force
consisted
of
234
employees,
all
of
them
union
members,
all
of
them
members
of
these
unions
who
initiated
the
present
proceeding.
now,
the
strike
was
an
economic
strike.
there
is
no
question
anywhere
in
this
case
about
any
unfair
labor
practice
being
connected
with
the
strike
and
the
reduction
of
force
was
also
an
economic
reduction,
no
question
of
any
unfair
labor
practice
in
determining
upon
the
number
of
employees
to
be
replaced.
while
bargaining
negotiations
were
going
on
between
the
employer
and
these
unions
for
looking
to
--
making
of
a
new
collective
agreement,
the
contract
expired.
and
some
two
weeks
after
that,
the
strike
began
there
--
there
being
no
contract.
as
to
the
seniority
rights
--
the
seniority
rights
expired
as
we
contend
with
the
contract.
those
rights
were
purely
breach
of
contract,
and
when
the
contract
came
to
an
end,
so
did
the
seniority
rights.
now
all
of
this
happened,
the
specific
occurrences
out
of
which
this
case
finally
--
although,
all
happened
in
--
in
quite
a
short
time.
the
general
workers
and
the
maintenance
workers
didn't
go
out.
i
mean
the
production
workers
didn't
go
out.
the
maintenance
workers
went
out
on
strike,
the
production
workers
did
not
and
the
company
decided
to
attempt
to
continue
to
operate
the
plant
and
not
to
close
down
on
account
of
the
strike.
some
other
strikers,
as
i
said,
triggered
back
to
work
and
among
of
them,
there
are
seven
who
are
the
employers
whom
the
board,
by
its
order,
has
directed
to
be
reinstated
in
lieu
of
seven
others
who
must
thereby
be
displaced.
the
company
gave
notice
to
the
unions
after
the
strike
had
been
going
on
about
a
couple
of
weeks
that
it
would
begin
to
interview
applicants
for
jobs
to
replace
the
strikers.
and
two
days
after
that,
the
union
ordered
the
whole
mass
of
remaining
strikers
back
to
work
without
any
settlement,
not
only
saw
that
on
a
notice,
this
body
of
men
just
suddenly
appeared.
and
at
that
time,
on
account
of
the
previously
determined
reduction
in
force,
there
were
94
more
employers
applying
for
work
and
that
were
upon
the
job
of
this
sort.
however,
these
employers
all
appeared
at
once,
the
company
was
wholly
unfair
that
had
no
notice
and
liability
of
coming
back,
it
couldn't
tell
of
course
how
many
had
come
whether
all,
or
only
a
--
a
large
part
and
tell
who
had
come
and
who
had
not.
so
there,
it
was
confronted
with
the
--
upon
the
risk
of
what
to
do.
well
what
they
did
was
to
let
them
all
in.
the
plant
had
been
strike
bound
now
for
some
three
weeks
and
--
and
probably,
there
was
plenty
of
--
of
temporary
work
to
be
done
so
they
--
they
let
them
all
in.
and
they
got
down
to
work
to
make
out
the
layoff
list
in
preparation
for
putting
into
effect
in
the
predetermined
but
delayed
reduction
in
force.
and
then
--
well,
in
less
than
two
weeks,
after
the
balance
of
the
strikers
came
back,
this
work
was
done
and
the
names
of
the
94
would
be
laid
off
had
been
determined.
and
then
on
april
2nd,
the
men
were
ordered
back
on
the
march
17th.
on
april
2nd,
the
parties
met
in
collective
bargaining,
well
if
you
again
can
try
to
settle
the
issues
which
would
follow
the
strike
in
which
they
again
failed.
but
at
that
meeting,
the
employers'
representatives
informed
the
union
that
the
layoff
had
been
determined
upon
and
gave
notice
as
to
the
names
of
the
employers
who
would
be
--
who
would
be
laid
off.
and
those
employees
included
the
seven
who
are
the
complainants
here.
and
they
had
greater
length
of
service
than
the
seven
who
had
been
--
who
had
returned
earlier
among
--
they
were
among
the
trip
that
goes
back,
and
who
would
have
to
be
displaced
upon
the
reinstatement
of
these
seven.
and
after
this
collective
bargaining
contract,
the
employer
proposed
a
clause
going
to
the
seniority
provision
of
the
new
collective
agreement
which
confirmed
that
the
employees
who
trickled
back
before
the
union
ordered
back
the
bounds
that
they
would
have
permanent
tenure
before
the
employees
who
came
in
at
the
end
with
respect
to
future
layoffs'
event.
in
other
words,
providing
that
--
mr.
william
a.
stuart
that
was
by
a
written
proposal
to
the
union
representatives
on
a
clause
to
be
included
in
the
new
collective
agreement.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
it
was
not,
your
honor.
nothing
was
said
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
so
far
as
the
record
shows,
nothing
was
said
one
way
or
the
other
when
the
men
came
back
or
than
the
later
time
until
the
layoff
list
was
being
made
out.
but
i
must
say
that
the
facts
briefly
and
they
indicate
that
it
was
assumed
that
this
man
did
come
back
with
permanent
tenure
that
they
were
reinstated
as
returning
strikers
with
permanent
tenure.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
it
was
assumed
here.
the
point
was
this,
your
honor.
as
we
contend,
here
was
the
plant
with
a
number
of
available
jobs.
the
plant
was
endeavoring
to
continue
to
operate,
and
were
practically
without
maintenance
employees.
there
was
a
great
need
for
maintenance
employees
in
order
to
continue
the
operation
of
the
plant.
now,
when
these
men
came
back,
they
were
employees,
they
were
on
a
strike,
they
were
entitled
to
reinstatement
and
they
got
it.
and
--
mr.
william
a.
stuart
no,
your
honor,
and
strangely,
when
i
say
strangely,
and
then
relate
the
court
held
that
of
that
had
happened,
if
the
employer
had
offered
the
strikers
as
an
inducement
to
return,
the
assurance
of
permanent
tenure
above
those
who
would
have,
who
stayed
out,
and
then
the
decision
would
have
been
different.
but
that
would
have
brought
it
within
the
mackay
doctrine
which
i
will
--
will
come
to.
but
that
--
that
position,
we
strongly
disagree
with.
if
the
court
please,
we
don't
think
that
the
employer
had
any
right
in
the
world
to
seek
--
to
get
these
employees
to
abandon
the
strike
by
offering
them
inducements.
and
we
think
that
it
would
have
been
sure
to
have
been
the
object
of
a
complaint
by
the
unions
for
strike
breaking
if
it
had
done
that.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
26
--
26
of
what,
your
honor?
mr.
william
a.
stuart
after
the
strike,
your
honor.
i
understood
that
mr.
justice
brennan
was
inquiring
whether
these
strikers,
while
the
strike
was
on,
were
offered
any
inducement
to
come
back
to
work
and
abandon
the
strike.
but
what
judge
dobie
is
talking
about
there
is
the
proposal
which
the
employer
made
and
which
the
employer
--
you
know
that
would've
put
into
effect
when
--
and
then
passed,
developed
in
the
bargaining
negotiation
doorway.
the
proposal
that
the
contract
recognized
the
fact
that
these
men
who
came
back,
while
there
were
available
jobs
and
before
the
body
had
been
ordered
back
by
the
union,
did
receive
permanent
tenure.
and
that
therefore,
in
the
case
of
future
layoffs,
the
man
who
came
back
last
would
be
laid
off
before,
there
was
--
who
trickled
back
during
the
strike.
but
--
mr.
william
a.
stuart
what
page
is
that?
mr.
william
a.
stuart
what
page
is
that,
your
honor?
mr.
william
a.
stuart
well,
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
he
meant
it.
at
any
rate,
i
don't
think
it
would
have
been
justified
if
it
was
meant
discriminatory
in
the
sense
of
being
a
violation
of
the
act.
now,
there
isn't
any
question
that
if
these
men
who
trickled
back,
then
on
being
reinstated
and
before
the
other
men
came
back
did
actually
--
were
actually
entitled
to
and
did
actually
receive
permanent
tenure.
there
isn't
any
question
that
by
getting
that,
they
got
a
superior
position
as
to
future
layoffs,
although
those
who
struck
to
strike
out
--
strike
out
to
the
end.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
well,
that
is
the
proposal
which
was
made
to
the
unions
by
the
employer
on
--
at
the
first
collective
bargaining
negotiation
and
conference
after
the
strike
ended.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
well,
i
think
that's
a
matter
of
--
of
inference,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
of
great
many
things
--
mr.
william
a.
stuart
well,
i
--
i
don't
deny
it.
i
don't
think
anyone
could
deny
that.
it
discouraged
union
activity
very
much
for
these
men
to
lose
a
strike.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
i
know
he
didn't,
but
i'm
saying
that.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
in
other
words,
there
are
great
many
things
may
have
a
discouraging
effect
on
union
activity
and
so,
with
the
difference,
i
say
this
to
your
honors,
still
may
not
be
a
violation
of
the
act.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
as
we
contend
--
mr.
william
a.
stuart
quite
so,
your
honor,
and
that
is
precisely
what
our
contention
is
here,
that
this
clause
to
be
added
to
the
contract
and
which
was
--
unilaterally
effectuate
it
and
then
the
union
then
agreed
to
it,
was
no
more
than
a
regulation
of
the
inevitable
consequences
of
the
fact
--
mr.
william
a.
stuart
--
no
more
than
a
recognition
and
a
confirmation
of
the
inevitable
consequences
of
the
fact
that
these
employees
came
back
to
work
from
a
strike
when
jobs
were
available,
and
thereby,
became
of
their
own
right
entitled
to
permanent
tenure
and
that's
what
they've
got.
and
as
a
result
of
that,
when
the
body
of
strikers
came
back
later,
there
were
later
for
a
fewer
permanent
jobs
than
there
were
employees
and
made
it
for
these
employees
who
came
back
last
had
to
take
temporary
jobs.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
i
am
contending
that
along
with
some
other
--
mr.
william
a.
stuart
--
along
with
some
other
things,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
that
is
--
that
is
--
no
--
no,
your
honor.
we're
not
making
that
either.
the
board
contended
that
this
was
a
reward
after
the
event
to
the
strikers
who
came
back
before
the
--
the
body
who
were
ordered
back
then
it
was
a
penalty
--
mr.
william
a.
stuart
everyone
agrees
that
nothing
was
said
before
they
came
back.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
precisely,
your
honor,
precisely.
and
we
are
saying
further
that
the
court,
in
placing
its
decision
holding
it
upon
the
ground
that
these
employees
who
trickled
back
were
not
approached
by
the
petitioner
and
were
not
offered
inducements
to
come
back
and
--
but
on
the
contrary
came
back
voluntarily
that
they
therefore
--
they
thereby
proved
that
it
wasn't
necessary
for
the
company
to
give
them
this
permanent
tenure
in
order
to
get
them,
and
therefore
they
weren't
entitled
to
it.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
well,
your
honor,
i
think
you
can
--
i
think
you
can
hold
with
me
without
doing
more
than
holding
that
this
employer
would
have
--
have
been
guilty
of
strike
breaking
if
it
had
done
the
same
which
was
the
sole
thing
the
court
said
they
didn't
do
in
order
to
win
a
favorable
decision
in
the
case.
and
let
me
--
let
--
mr.
william
a.
stuart
the
finding
--
the
finding
is
wrong,
your
honor,
and
that
it
--
mr.
william
a.
stuart
not
supported
by
the
evidence,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
don't
think
it's
quite
as
simple
as
that.
your
--
your
honor
is
going
to
have
before
you
the
question
of
the
applicability
of
the
mackay
decision
of
this
court.
that's
the
whole
thing
here.
that's
the
--
that's
the
doctrine
on
which
both
parties
rely
here.
and
if
mackay
is
interpreted
as
we
contend
then
that's
automatically
not
to
set
finding
out,
it's
a
matter
of
law
more
than
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
let
me
--
let
me
just
read,
your
honor,
exactly
what
mackay
does
say.
of
course,
that
--
it's
in
a
very
short
--
mr.
william
a.
stuart
--
brief
on
pages
18
and
19
in
our
brief
--
19
and
20,
your
honor.
nor
was
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
to
replace
the
striking
employees
without
us
and
enough
to
carry
on
the
business.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
that
was
the
board's
finding.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
well
--
mr.
william
a.
stuart
we
got
over
it
in
this
way,
your
honor.
the
board
started,
they
started
these
whole
proceeding
now
--
they
--
they
started
the
deal
at
the
end
of
the
strike
and
there's
the
--
after
everybody
was
back.
and
they
said,
"then
after
the
strike
was
over,
you
came
here
to
the
bargaining
conference
with
this
proposal
and
you
put
it
unilaterally
into
effect
after
the
strike
was
over
when
we
declined
to
a
great
turn."
but
now,
what
the
board
didn't
do
and
as
we
say
should
have
done
was
to
--
regarded
back
to
the
time
during
the
strike
and
should
have
consulted
the
mackay
case
or
the
mackay
doctrine
as
applying
then
when
these
men
came
back.
when
they
came
back,
they
had
the
right.
they
were
employees
and
they
had
the
right
to
reinstatement
and
permanent
tenure,
they
had
that
right.
and
if
the
employer
had
declined
to
receive
them
in
permanent
tenure,
the
employee
--
the
employer
would
probably
--
probably
have
been
the
object
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding.
as
a
matter
of
law,
they
had
that
right.
now
the
board,
instead
of
starting
now
where
it
should
have
started,
it
started
at
a
much
later
period
when
what
was
done
merely
confirms
the
legal
effects
of
what
had
happened
while
the
strike
was
going
on.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
and
it's
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
that's
right.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
in
relation
to,
your
honor,
what
happened
after
the
strike
and
without
any
relation
at
all
to
what
happened
during
the
strike.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
william
a.
stuart
we
--
mr.
william
a.
stuart
well,
if
we
did
it,
but
we
didn't
do
it.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
well,
they
--
they
draw
that
as
more
to
legal
conclusion
on
a
closed
conclusion
of
facts,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
well,
i
--
i
want
to
have
a
little
something
to
say
about
judge
dobie's
decision
in
a
moment.
but
i
--
i
do
want
to
--
i
do
want
to
get
this
clear.
as
we
contend
what
was
done
after
the
strike
in
putting
into
black
and
white
this
provision
as
to
the
two
classes
--
in
case
of
--
of
subsequent
layoffs.
that
did
no
more
than
recognize
what
had
happened
as
a
necessary
legal
consequence
during
the
strike.
we're
--
we're
standing
on
law
here
and
not
on
the
facts,
your
honor,
and
i
--
i
want
to
go
away
from
the
board's
--
from
the
idea
that
that
is
a
board
that
--
that
finding
of
the
board
is
a
finding
of
fact
upon
any
basis
that
the
board
can
stand
upon.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
but
that's
our
position.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
seniority
rights.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
there's
no
such
contention.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
yes,
your
honor,
and
there's
no
contention
on
the
part
of
the
--
of
the
board
at
all
that
this
was
aimed
at
people
who
--
who
are
particularly
active
in
the
strike,
none
at
all.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
all
the
men
who
had
the
greater
length
of
service
got
back.
and
this
made
it
for
just
caught
to
pay
a
land.
all
of
them
but
these
seven
had
so
little
length
of
service
that
even
under
the
board's
construction,
they
still
didn't
get
in.
but
the
--
the
--
it
was
just
these
seven
who
were
far
down
the
list,
anyhow,
who
were
not
outranked
by
the
lower
seven
of
those
who
were
--
who
were
kept.
but
i
--
i
do
--
i
don't
want
to
urge
this
upon
the
court
that
the
board
in
finding
that
there
was
a
--
in
effect
that
there
was
a
violation
of
seniority
here
that
there
was
a
discrimination
against
seniority.
we
contend
this
stronger
as
we
can
that
the
board
introduced
in
the
case
a
very
confusing
issue
there
because
there
was
no
seniority
at
all,
it
was
not
in
existence,
and
these
men
had
no
seniority.
and
to
say
that
the
employer
departed
from
its
former
seniority
policy
is
merely
to
say
that
it
departed
from
the
provisions
of
the
collective
agreement
to
which
had
been
enforced
before
it
expire.
and
i
--
mr.
william
a.
stuart
we
cite
the
authorities,
if
your
honor
please.
in
the
brief,
i
think
not.
and
in
fact
the
--
the
trial
examiner
in
this
case
made
that
point
very
neatly.
when
the
board
attorney
was
undertaking
to
say
that
there
should
be
some
regard
to
the
seniority
provisions,
the
old
contract
even
though
it
had
had
expired.
and
the
trial
examiner
said,
"well,
you
went
on
a
strike
didn't
you?"
and
the
board
attorney
said,
"yes,
but
the
contract
had
expired."
the
trial
examiner
said,
"yes,
that's
my
point."
in
other
words,
there
was
a
--
there
was
a
--
a
no-strike
provision
on
this
contract.
unless
the
contract
had
expired,
of
course,
there
couldn't
have
been
any
strike
and
none
of
this
would
have
happened.
and
we
do
contend
most
strongly
that
there
was
no
seniority
in
effect
and
there
are
a
number
of
cases
cited
in
the
--
in
the
brief.
now,
the
whole
--
the
whole
point
of
the
case
--
mr.
william
a.
stuart
nothing
to
say.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
nothing
to
say.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
a.
stuart
the
termination
of
the
agreement
as
emphasized
by
the
fact
that
the
employees
promptly
went
on
a
strike
thereafter,
against
--
what
would
have
been
against
the
no-strike
clause
in
the
contract.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
yes.
and
he
--
he
was
just
wrong,
your
honor.
as
--
as
we
contend,
there
wasn't
any
seniority.
and
he
lost
sight
of
the
fact
that
earlier,
he
--
he
had
recognized
the
fact
that
there
--
there
was
nothing
under
the
contract
in
effect.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
now,
i'd
like
to
--
i'd
like
just
to
summarize
this
point
which
really
is
the
whole
point
of
the
case
as
we
see
it.
and
that
is
that
here
were
returning
strikers
who
applied
for
reinstatement.
there
were
numerous
jobs
available
at
the
time,
they
were
entitled
to
reinstatement
and
permanent
tenure
and
they
got
it.
now,
when
they
were
in
there,
they
were
there.
they
had
a
position
that
they
were
entitled
to
and
were
entitled
to
defend
against
the
other
strikers
who
did
--
who
had
not
returned
under
the
very
clear
holding
of
the
mackay
decision
as
--
as
we
understand.
the
--
the
mackay
case
says,
he
is
not
bound,
the
employer,
he
is
not
bound
to
destroy
--
to
discharge
those
higher,
to
fill
the
places
of
strikers
upon
the
election
of
the
latter
to
resume
their
employment
in
order
to
create
places
for
them.
well,
now
that's
what
the
board
has
done
here.
it
has
ordered
this
employer
to
lay
off
these
seven
men
who
obtained
permanent
tenure
by
coming
back,
presenting
themselves
and
getting
it
while
there
were
ample
jobs
available.
the
board
has
ordered
the
employer
to
lay
them
off
in
order
to
make
places
for
strikers
who
returned
later,
and
for
whom
there
were
not
available
jobs.
now,
that
--
that
is
what
the
case
comes
down
to
and
irrespective
of
the
finding
of
fact
which
amounts
to
an
inference
as
to
the
employer's
motivation
in
connection
with
the
time
at
which
the
proposal
to
the
union
was
made,
irrespective
of
that.
we
contend
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
these
seven
employees
along
with
a
number
of
others
who
returned
before
the
strike
was
called
off
by
the
unions
that
they
acquired
a
status
which
they
are
entitled
to
hold.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
your
honor,
i
am
speaking
of
the
motivation
at
the
material
and
critical
time.
there
could
not
have
been
any
such
motivation
as
the
board
found
at
the
time
when
these
men
presented
themselves.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
the
board
found
this
as
to
something
that
happened
long
afterwards.
and
they
didn't
go
back
to
the
time
when
the
motivation
would
have
counted,
that's
our
point,
when
the
motivation
applied.
and
the
employer
could
have
had
only
one
motivation
when
these
men
presented
themselves.
and
that
was
that
it
was
his
obligation
to
admit
them
to
the
plant
and
give
them
--
put
them
back
to
reinstatement
in
permanent
tenure
employment.
and
that
was
the
decisive
time
--
and
that's
when
the
status
was
fixed.
now
that's
our
contention
on
what
--
whatever
the
board
may
have
found
as
to
the
things
that
happened
afterward,
can't
relate
back
to
that,
and
our
inference
based
on
--
based
on
this
black
and
white
confirmation
of
a
legal
status
which
arose
while
the
strike
was
going,
can't
--
can't
affect
that
as
we
contend.
now,
the
--
i
want
to
--
i
want
to
say
something
here
about
the
court's
decision
because
as
the
point
file
which
i
think
is
--
is
quite
well
remarkable.
the
board
and
the
court
found
that
this
was
a
discriminatory
interference
with
the
exercise
of
the
right
to
strike
by
rewarding
the
strikers
who
returned
before
for
abandoning
the
strike
and
thereby
penalizing
the
others
for
continuing
to
stay
at
it.
now,
that
decision,
if
the
court
will
examine
it
on
this
point,
is
on
extraordinarily
narrow
ground.
and
that
is
this
that
the
promise
of
permanent
tenure
was
not
made
to
these
strikers
before
they
returned
from
the
strike
and
as
an
inducement
to
return.
on
page
30,
here
is
what
the
court
said,
"with
a
strike
in
progress,
the
primary
concern
of
the
employer
is
to
keep
his
plant
in
operation.
it
is
then
proper
for
an
employer
who
might
be
unable
to
procure
replacement
save
upon
a
promise
of
permanent
tenure,
to
promise
such
tenure
to
the
replacements."
now,
that
is
evidently
saying
that
if
the
employer
had
done
that
here,
the
decision
would
have
been
in
his
favor.
but
says
the
court,
"when
the
strike
is
over,
when
the
plant
is
in
operation,
then
the
imposition
of
the
superseniority
policy
in
favor
of
the
replacements
and
against
the
strikers
is
quite
a
different
matter."
the
whole
thing
is
on
that
now
and
they've
had
it.
that
is
the
case
before
us.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
here
to
show
that
at
the
time
of
olin
secured
these
replacements
for
the
strikers,
olin
made
any
promise
of
permanent
tenure
to
these
replacements.
and
within
our
brief,
the
mackay
case,
as
condoning
this
conduct
on
the
part
of
olin.
now,
the
board
--
the
board's
conclusion
was
the
same.
that
simply
follows
the
conclusion
of
the
board.
if
their
whole
case
turns
from
the
fact
that
it
wasn't
necessary
in
the
situation
that
existed
in
the
strike,
it
wasn't
necessary
for
the
employer
to
promise
these
strikers
any
inducement
in
order
to
get
him
to
come
back.
since
he
came
back
voluntarily
and
the
employer
was
not
under
the
--
the
pressure
in
endeavoring
to
keep
its
plant
operating
to
approach
them
and
offer
them
inducements
to
come,
that
therefore,
the
decision
is
against
the
employer.
whereas
if
the
employer
had
done
that,
it
would
have
been
--
it
would
have
been
the
employers'
favor.
now,
we
say
and
the
cases
that
was
cited
in
the
brief
that
the
employer
couldn't
possibly
have
done
that
without
being
open
to
a
charge
of
strike
breaking
and
we
understand
the
board
to
concede
that
in
its
brief.
now,
the
--
the
order
of
the
board
on
page
41
of
the
transcript
says
this,
and
i
come
back
again
to
that
matter
of
seniority
and
departure
from
the
former
seniority
policy
which
the
board
found.
item

mr.
william

stuart
page
41
of
the
transcript,
item
c.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
yes,
your
honor.
c,
rescind
forthwith
his
discriminatory
seniority
policy
announced
on
april
2nd,
1954
and
effectuated
on
april
9,
1954
and
restore
all
employees
affected
thereby
to
the
seniority
they
would
have
enjoyed,
absence
such
discriminatory
policy.
now,
that
is
the
prime
example
of
the
confusion
which
the
board
introduced
in
the
--
in
the
case
by
assuming
the
existence
of
seniority
rights
in
these
employees
when
they
didn't
exist.
now
that
order,
as
we
--
as
we
see
it,
certainly
would
be
very
difficult
to
see
how
that
order
could
possibly
be
enforced.
what
in
the
world
is
the
seniority
they
would
have
enjoyed,
absence
to
such
discriminatory
policies
--
policy,
nobody
can
say.
the
act
doesn't
create
any
seniority.
the
--
the
contract
had
expired.
they
--
they
didn't
enjoy
any
seniority.
and
that
--
that
is
just
an
illustration
as
--
as
we
contend
of
the
confusion
in
--
into
which
the
board
was
led
by
assuming
that
there
was
any
distinction
between
these
employees
on
the
ground
of
length
of
service.
there
weren't
any.
the
board
--
the
--
the
employer
might
very
well
have
taken
any
number
of
different
tests
or
basis
for
deciding
who's
going
to
--
who's
going
to
be
retained
and
who's
going
to
be
laid
off.
he
wasn't
limited
by
the
law.
he
might
have
laid
them
off
on
a
basis
of
skill
and
efficiency
or
of
any
number
of
things.
but
he
actually
did
use
was
what
the
board
is
complaining
about
here.
but
our
contention
is
that
that
issue
has
no
place
in
the
case.
there
was
no
seniority,
there's
no
seniority
policy,
and
there
were
no
seniority
rights
which
these
seven
could
call
upon
the
--
could
successfully
call
upon
the
board
to
enforce.
now,
this
--
this
case
has
the
same
question
exactly.
it
was
before
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
--
in
the
potlatch
case.
and
the
ninth
circuit
decided
in
accordance
with
the
contentions
which
we
are
making
here.
in
fact,
the
written
proposal
which
the
court
has
denounced
in
this
case
was
almost
word
for
word
the
same
as
it
was
in
the
potlatch
case.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
understand
the
board
to
concede
that
practically.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
the
findings
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
a.
stuart
the
situation
on
the
potlatch
case
was
in
all
essential
particular
as
the
same
as
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
they've
found
that
in
potlatch
too,
your
honor
and
then
the
court
overturned
it.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
no
sir.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
there's
practically
no
difference
in
the
evidence,
your
honor.
the
whole
thing
went
along
just
exactly
the
same
way.
precisely,
the
only
difference
was,
and
i
don't
think
that's
a
material
difference
at
all
that
there
were
some
new
employees
as
replacements
who
came
in
as
well
as
some
returning
strikers.
but
the
announcement
was
made
by
the
employer
in
both
cases
after
the
strike
had
failed.
it
was
made
at
the
beginning
of
the
first
bargaining
conference.
it's
true
that
in
potlatch,
the
strike
was
settled
at
the
bargaining
conferences
and
this
case
was
not
settled
but
the
announcement
we
made
at
exactly
the
same
time,
they
were
at
the
beginning
of
the
bargaining
conferences
and
that's
where
they
argued
to
fail
and
after
the
plant
was
going
on
in
collaboration.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
yes.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
yes,
your
honor.
well,
that
--
mr.
william
a.
stuart
that's
accurate
but
the
inference
is
erroneous,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
well,
let
me
--
mr.
william
a.
stuart
let
me
explain
this,
your
honor,
which
will
account
for
the
answer
i
gave
your
honor.
the
court
there
was
assuming
that
the
plant
had
been
shutdown
by
the
strike,
which
it
had
not,
and
was
assuming
that
mr.
stull
was
talking
about
its
being
shutdown
by
future
strike
which
it
was
not.
if
--
when
your
honor
considers
the
facts,
you
will
find
that
this
was
a
trial
run
of
this
plant.
the
list
it
was
going
to
terminate
was
regardless
--
regarding
among
the
plant
and
was
a
list
to
this
employer
on
the
list
which
was
terminated
the
following
year.
and
the
production
record
which
was
made
during
this
period,
this
very
critical
period,
it
was
going
to
determine
whether
at
least
it
was
going
to
be
renewed
or
whether
all
these
employees
would
be
out
of
the
job.
now,
that
was
the
plant
but
as
the
--
the
point
about
the
plant
being
shutdown.
and
if
the
contract,
if
your
honor
would
look
at
the
--
would
--
would
look
at
the
exhibit
and
read
that
in
this
context,
you
will
see
that
what
mr.
stull
was
talking
about
was
the
possibility
that
unless
men
were
loyal
to
the
job
and
the
plant
operated
at
--
at
full
blast
and
effectively
that
the
plant
wouldn't
shutdown
because
the
top
measure
would
renew
the
list
the
following
year.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it
has.
mr.
william
a.
stuart
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
also
in
that
case,
however,
you
indicated
pretty
strongly
that
under
taft-hartley,
you
were
not
bound
in
the
same
way
that
you
had
formerly
been
by
the
board's
findings.
and
what
the
court
has
done
here
has
been
to
have
more,
as
a
matter
of
law
than
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
it
--
as
we
contend.
and
now,
if
the
court
please,
i
should
like
to
--
i
have
only
a
few
minutes
left
on
my
time,
i
should
like
to
reserve
it
for
rebuttal.
