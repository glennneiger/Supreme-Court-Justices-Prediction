mr.
roger
d.
fisher
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
and
the
companion
case
to
be
argued
immediately
after
it
are
deportation
cases
which
involve
the
construction
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952.
they
both
reached
this
court
on
certiorari
from
the
sixth
circuit,
and
they
both
turned
on
a
single
question
of
whether
the
1952
act
made
persons
deportable
who
were
not
deportable
just
prior
to
that
act.
the
act
itself
make
persons
theretofore,
not
deportable,
deportable
respondent
carson
in
this
case,
a
native
and
citizen
of
italy.
he
entered
the
united
states
as
--
in
1919
as
a
stowaway.
stowaways
at
that
time
were
among
the
classes
then
excluded
by
law.
this
was
an
illegal
entry.
under
the
law
at
that
time,
if
he'd
been
found
within
five
years,
he
should
have
been
deported.
under
the
law
he
would
have
been
deported.
in
1936,
he
was
convicted
of
two
separate
--
on
two
separate
occasions
for
the
crime
of
blackmail.
shortly
after
that,
1937,
while
he
was
still
in
prison
for
those
offenses,
a
deportation
proceeding
under
the
old
act
was
begun.
this
was
continued
when
he
got
out
of
prison
in
1941
and
--
but
by
--
in
1945,
governor
lausche
of
ohio
gave
him
a
conditional
pardon
for
one
of
the
two
blackmail
offenses.
under
the
law
as
it
then
existed,
a
conditional
pardon
was
a
sufficient
pardon
to
bring
one
out
of
the
deportation
ground
which
was
two
crimes
involving
moral
turpitude.
the
next
--
the
new
--
this
present
deportation
proceeding
was
begun
in
1953,
on
the
terms
of
the
1952
act.
there
was
a
hearing,
he
was
ordered
deported
by
the
inspection
inquiry
officer.
the
order
was
affirmed
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals.
respondent
filed
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
january,
1954.
the
district
court
denied
the
petition.
the
court
of
appeals
through
the
sixth
circuit
reversed.
the
united
states
petitioned
for
certiorari
to
this
court
to
review
this
construction
of
the
act,
and
because
of
a
conflict
with
the
gagliano
against
bonds
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
because
we
submit
the
conflict
with
the
marcello
decision
of
this
court.
the
present
deportation
is
based
on
two
grounds,
both
under
the
present
act.
i'll
get
to
them
in
more
detail,
but
one
is
the
stowaway,
the
illegal
entry
in
1919.
the
second
is
the
two
crimes
involving
moral
turpitude.
under
the
1952
act,
a
conditional
pardon
is
not
adequate
to
prevent
deportation
for
two
such
crimes.
it
is
agreed
by
the
government
that
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
1952
act,
carson
was
not
deportable.
the
deportation
provisions
of
the
act
on
their
face,
however,
make
respondent
deportable.
there
the
--
these
two
grounds
both
raised
the
same
issue,
the
issue
of
retroactivity.
that
the
--
in
construing
the
statute
there
are
two
sections
which
we
are
involved.
the
first
is
section
241,
which
outlines
the
grounds
for
deportation,
and
second
is
section
405,
the
general
savings
clause
at
the
end
of
the
statute.
the
government
contends
that
section
241
is
a
specific
provision
which
specifically
provides
that
aliens
who've
done
the
things
that
carson
in
this
case
and
catalanotte
in
the
next
case
have
done,
shall
be
deported.
the
savings
clause,
on
upon
which
respondents
rely,
does
not
apply
to
cases
where
it
is
otherwise
specifically
provided.
the
second
contention
is
that
in
any
event,
respondent
carson
here
and
catalanotte,
in
the
other
case,
did
not
have
any
status
or
other
rights
of
the
kind.
they
were
carried
forward
by
the
savings
clause.
the
mere
failure
of
congress
to
provide
for
their
deportation
earlier
did
not
confer
upon
them
a
non-deportable
status
which
would
protect
them
against
the
provisions
of
the
new
law.
before
getting
to
the
legislative
history
in
the
construction
of
these,
this
section,
section
241,
has
been
before
this
court
twice
before.
in
schaumburg
against
the
united
states,
decided
in
april,
1955,
the
court
held
that
the
petitioner
could
not
be
naturalized
while
there
was
a
pending
deportation
proceeding
under
this
section.
the
court
at
that
time
explicitly
left
open
the
question
being
argued
today,
that
the
savings
clause
might
protect
them
from
the
deportation
charge.
during
the
next
month,
section
241
was
again
before
this
court
in
the
marcello
case,
marcello
against
bonds
in
349
u.s.
the
factual
situation
there
is
parallel
to
that
here
and
identical
to
that
in
the
catalanotte
case.
marcello,
who
had
been
--
had
a
narcotics
conviction
in
1938
under
statute
which
at
the
time
did
not
make
him
deportable,
was
not
deportable
prior
to
1952
act.
this
court
there
found
that
section
241
was
retroactive,
in
that
made
a
conviction
at
any
time
a
ground
for
deportation.
in
view
of
this
decision,
the
court
went
on
and
had
to
face
the
constitutional
question
of
whether
the
1952
act
was
constitutional
as
--
or
was
it
against
the
ex
post
facto
provisions.
the
court
found
the
statute
to
be
valid.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
because
it's
a
civil
case,
because
its
deportation
not
punished,
is
not
a
crime.
the
marcello
case
would
be
controlling
here
but
for
respondent's
contention
that
this
court
did
not
explicitly
consider
the
savings
clause
and
whether
that
clause
overcame
the
provisions
for
section
241.
in
marcello,
the
petitioner
in
that
case
filed
a
supplemental
petition
for
certiorari
raising
the
savings
clause
question.
it
was
denied
and
although
the
savings
clause
was
mentioned
in
both
briefs
it
was
not
argued
before
the
court.
the
court,
however,
had
one
month
before
had
both
the
menasche
and
schaumberg
cases
devote
exclusively
to
the
savings
clause
and
the
record
in
the
marcello
case
raised
the
savings
clause
at
which
had
been
considered
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
below.
the
court
did
not
explicitly
consider.
certiorari
has
been
granted
on
these
cases.
and
we'll
now
go
to
the
question
of
whether
section
241,
which
this
court
found
to
be
retroactive
and
which
respondent
concedes
is
retroactive
on
its
face
is
overcome
by
the
general
savings
clause
section
405
at
the
end
of
the
statute.
the
government
contends
that
the
marcello
construction
of
the
statute
is
correct,
and
that
under
the
1952
act,
aliens
were
made
deportable
who
were
not
theretofore
deportable.
respondent's
decision
is
that
section
241
is
not
a
specific
provision
from
the
meaning
of
the
savings
clause.
it
does
not
specifically
provide
that
this
person
should
be
deported,
they
said.
he
can
--
respondent
contends
that
persons
nondeportable
under
the
old
act
had
a
certain
nondeportable
status
which
was
saved
under
the
language
of
the
old
act.
i'd
like
--
before
--
i'll
come
to
this
later.
but
respondent's
construction
of
the
statute
completely
eliminates
the
retroactive
effect
of
all
the
language
in
section
241
because
anybody
who
was
not
deportable
before
would
not
be
made
deportable
under
the
new
provisions.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
one
argument
advanced
by
respondent.
but
to
be
specifically
--
to
be
accepted
from
405,
there
must
be
reference
to
405.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
he
suggested
the
only
cases
those
which
refer
to
405
(b)
is
good
enough
for
405
(a),
but
that's
as
far
as
we've
got
on
that.
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
language
of
the
statute
and
then
take
up
the
history
of
these
two
sections.
for
the
convenience
of
the
court,
we
have
reprinted
the
entire
section
241
in
the
back
of
the
government's
reply
brief
in
number
72.
it
ran
some
nine
pages.
we've
put
in
boldface
type
the
--
the
wording
that
has
to
do
with
the
timing
of
the
offense
whether
it
should
be
before
or
after
entry,
before
the
act,
after
the
act
at
anytime,
this
has
been
put
in
boldface
to
show
the
concern
which
the
congress
had
for
this
problem.
i'd
like
to
take
for
example
on
page
85
in
the
appendix
of
the
reply
brief,
section
241
(a)
(11)
at
the
bottom
of
the
act
relating
to
narcotics.
here
in
one
paragraph,
i
think
as
clearly
as
anywhere
else,
you
can
see
the
timing
and
the
concern
of
congress
that
this
be
retroactive.
this
is
the
section
under
which
respondent
catalanotte
in
the
next
case
is
being
deported.
section
11
--
241
(a)
(11)
reads,
"that
anyone
should
be
deported
who
is
or
hereafter
at
any
time
after
entry
has
been
a
narcotic
drug
addict
or
who
at
anytime
has
been
convicted
of
a
violation
of
any
law
or
regulation
relating
to
the
illicit
traffic
in
narcotic
drugs."
i
think
the
contrast
between
that
hereafter
relating
to
the
addicts
and
who,
at
any
time,
has
been
convicted
relating
to
persons
convicted
of
traffic
and
narcotics
indicates
on
its
face
a
retroactive
intent.
any
doubt,
as
to
the
intent
of
congress
by
looking
at
the
language
itself
of
the
statute,
should
be
removed
by
section
241
(d)
which
appears
on
page
89
of
the
appendix
to
our
reply
brief.
except
as
otherwise
specifically
provided
in
this
section,
the
provisions
of
this
section
shall
be
applicable
to
all
aliens
belonging
to
any
of
the
classes
enumerated
in
subsection
(a)
--
that's
the
section
we're
concerned
with.
notwithstanding,
that
any
such
alien
enter
the
united
states
prior
to
the
date
of
enactment
of
this
act
or
(2),
that
the
facts
by
reason
of
which
any
such
alien
belongs
to
any
of
the
classes
enumerated
in
subsection
(a)
occurred
prior
to
the
date
of
enactment
of
this
act.
faced
with
this
language,
respondent
is
compelled
to
admit
that
241
is
retroactive.
they
--
on
page
28
of
respondent's
brief,
"we
admit
as
did
the
court
below
that
some
provisions
of
section
241
are
retroactive
and
that
others
are
not."
where
a
prospective
application
of
section
241
was
desired,
the
word
"hereafter"
was
used.
except
as
provided
in
section
241,
section
241(d)
made
the
deportation
provisions
retroactive.
now
i
don't
know
what
respondent
means
by
saying
that
it
is
retroactive
and
then
coming
around
and
saying
that
the
savings
clause
takes
this
all
away.
the
savings
clause
under
respondent's
contention
means
that
no
person
can
be
deported
by
reason
of
fact
that
occurred
prior
to
the
date
of
an
act
unless
under
prior
law
they
were
made
deportable.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
1952
act,
as
we
read
it,
leaves
him
non-deportable.
this
is
because
the
facts
by
reason
--
one
under
section
(d)
which
i
just
read
to
the
court
--
the
facts
by
reason
of
which
an
alien
belongs
--
and
i
interpolate
--
or
does
not
belong,
which
i
think
is
the
reason
which
you
belong
or
do
not
belong
to
the
class
enumerated
notwithstanding,
they
occurred
prior
to
the
date
of
the
act.
in
other
words,
the
events
of
all
kinds
are
to
be
judged
by
this
law,
not
by
the
old
law.
you're
to
take
the
prior
facts
by
reason
of
which
he
is
or
is
not
deportable
and
measure
them
against
the
present
law.
a
suspension
of
deportation
or
private
bill
was
valid
for
the
old
law;
it's
valid
for
the
new
law.
if
it
occurred
under
the
new
law
it
will
be
all
right.
if
the
events
by
which
it's
deportable
had
occurred
under
the
new
law,
is
he
deportable
or
is
he
not?
every
private
bill,
every
suspension
of
deportation,
every
adjustment
of
status
is
protected
by
the
government's
construction
of
the
statute.
let
me
explain,
contrast
that
with
respondent's
case.
he
had
two
crimes
involving
moral
turpitude
and
a
conditional
pardon.
that
those
that
occurred
after
the
act
measured
by
this
law,
he
is
deportable.under
the
old
law
he
was
not.
conditional
pardon
was
enough
from
the
old
law.
a
conditional
pardon
is
not
enough
under
present
law.
he
had
an
illegal
entry
and
five
years
passed.
on
the
old
law,
he
can
no
longer
be
deported.
if
these
events
had
occurred
under
the
new
law
he
would
be
deported.
if
during
the
many
years
respondent
was
here,
he'd
adjusted
his
status
coming
at
--
had
a
private
bill,
had
a
suspension
of
deportation,
those
events
being
measured
by
the
new
law
would
be
valid.
he'd
be
protected.
we
do
not
--
and
respondent
i
know
in
his
brief
spent
sometime
in
all
the
thousands
of
cases
that
will
be
--
have
to
be
taken
up.
that
is
not
--
i
think
--
i
think
the
language
is
quite
clear,
that
the
events
are
to
be
measured
by
the
new
law.
in
that
there's
no
--
notwithstanding,
any
private
bills,
notwithstanding
any
suspension
of
deportation,
not
withstanding
adjustments
of
status
it
merely
says
notwithstanding
the
facts
occurred
prior
to
the
date
of
this
statute.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
interpret
section
405
(a)
which
i
plan
to
come
to
in
some
detail
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
this
is
--
this
is
--
i'm
on
241
(d).
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
was
he
thought
this
would
be
too
broad.
that
if
our
construction
of
241
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
yes,
i
--
i
would
think
that
--
that
a
person
with
a
private
bill
--
we
don't
have
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
had
status
within
405
(a)
--
i
would
concede
that
he
did
for
the
--
for
the
sake
of
argument
because
in
241,
it
does
not
specifically
provide
that
he
shall
be
deported.
the
only
retroactive
effect
of
241
is
as
the
persons
who
when
judged
by
the
new
law
would
be
deportable.
i
don't
have
it
--
if
241
does
not
specifically
provide
for
their
deportation
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
we
don't
reach
the
question
of
whether
their
status
is
--
is
preserved
or
not.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
as
to
the
--
as
to
--
as
to
the
deportable
status
--
as
to
grounds
for
deportation
as
to
which
no
other
events
occurred
i
do.
for
i
read
--
it
cuts
you
off
against
the
government
in
the
other
way
where
this
is
narrower
as
for
example
in
the
case
of
a
member
of
the
who
would
have
been
deportable
under
the
old
act.
we
do
not
contend
that
he
has
a
deportable
status
that's
preserved
in
the
face
of
these
specific
provisions.
a
member
of
the
totalitarian
organization
such
as
one
who
affiliated
and
supported
franco
of
spain
under
the
prior
act,
anyone
who
supported
the
totalitarian
organization
which
had
and
so
forth
was
to
be
deported.
on
the
new
act,
anyone
who
supports
such
totalitarian
organization
is
not
deportable
unless
the
organization
plans
to
establish
a
totalitarian
system
in
the
united
states.t
his
has
narrowed
it
down.
the
prior
deportable
that
we
think
is
there's
a
specific
provision
and
it's
retroactive
so
it
would
not
catch
up.
we
would
not
be
in
an
normal
position
of
deporting
people
who
were
now
admissible
by
the
present
standard.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
actually
a
totalitarian
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
oh,
but
there
are
may
be
other
--
you
can
read
the
two
sections
again
to
a
great

mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
the
earlier
provision
--
let's
see
if
i
have
the
--
i
can't
find
the
language
at
the
moment.
the
earlier
provision
was
in
a
--
it
wasn't
affiliated
with
a
totalitarian
organization
--
in
any
totalitarian
organization.
now,
it
must
be
an
organization
seek
--
seeking
to
set
up
the
totalitarian
form
of
government
in
this
--
in
the
united
states.
that's
--
that
i
must
say
the
mccarran
act
is
much
broader
on
grounds
of
deportation
in
general.
this
as
far
as
i
know
is
the
only
narrowing
provision.
section
241,
legislative
history
was
in
the
first
draft
of
the
bill.
the
senate
report
which
was
referred
to
in
the
brief,
the
catalanotte
case
indicated
they
planned
to
have
it
retroactive
in
nature.
as
respondent
points
out,
the
most
critical
fact
of
this
relation
between
the
savings
clause
in
section
241,
in
the
legislative
history
is
in
the
first
bill,
the
savings
clause
was
not
applicable
to
section
241.
the
savings
clause
appeared
at
the
end
of
the
naturalization
section
rather
than
its
present
position
five
sections
later
at
the
end
of
the
act.
so,
in
the
first
bill,
the
savings
clause
did
not
affect
any
deportation
proceeding.
and
if
the
bill
has
been
adopted
and
then
drafted,
respondent
would
have
to
concede
that
he's
required
to
be
deported.
his
contention
is
that
when
the
savings
clause
was
moved
to
the
end
of
the
act,
this
showed
an
overwhelming
intent
by
congress
that
the
status
quo
should
be
preserved
in
deportation
cases.
we
see
no
such
intent
and
--
and
believe
the
contrary
to
the
tenor
of
the
history
of
that
act.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
for
which
they
had
other
specific
provisions
in
the
act.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
as
a
specific
provision,
yes,
your
honor.
the
section
241
(d),
which
we
believe
would
be
meaningless
under
respondent's
construction,
was
drafted
to
make
this
reading
back,
applying
a
new
law
to
the
old
facts,
and
that's
the
way
it
reads.
respondent
suggests
that
it
was
put
in
there
so
that
persons
who
were
deportable
on
the
old
act,
who've
committed
deportable
offenses
would
still
be
deportable
under
the
new
act.
and
he
cites
the
general
savings
act
in
the
case
under
it
to
support
his
position.
the
case
cited
seems
to
hold
the
contrary
for
the
point
to
which
he
relies
on
it
for.
the
case
holds
that
the
general
savings
act
and
the
1
u.s.c.109
carries
forward
any
such
liability.
there,
it
was
a
criminal
punishment
and
without
the
need
of
any
express
savings
clause.
we
believe
it
does.
the
general
savings
act
would
apply.
in
any
event,
section
405
(a)
as
read
by
respondents
would
apply
and
they
would
not,
241
(d)
would
be
completely
superfluous
and
meaningless
under
respondent's
construction
because
anybody
who
is
deportable
on
the
old
act
would
have
a
deportable
status
carried
forward.
anybody
non-deportable
would
have
a
non-deportable
status
to
carry
forward.
the
language
in
section
241
(d)
itself
shows
no
such
intent
to
carry
forward
past
deportable
grounds.
it
has
drafted
the
other
way
around.
it
says
that
the
pass
back
is
to
be
governed
by
the
new
law.
it's
just
the
reverse
of
the
drafting
anyone
wouldn't
use
if
he
was
merely
trying
to
keep
prior
deportable
grounds
effective
under
the
new
act.
after
the
--
in
the
very
first
bill,
the
immigration
service
submitted
their
analysis
to
congress
which
has
been
referred
to
by
this
court,
which
says
the
language
used,
of
course,
its
retroactive
effect
to
deportation
provisions
of
the
bill.
the
question
of
adopting
such
provisions
seems
to
be
a
matter
of
legislative
policies.
now,
at
the
very
time
the
savings
clause
would
move
to
the
end
of
the
act
and
made
applicable
to
deportation
proceedings
by
a
change
in
location,
there
were
other
changes
within
section
241
indicating
that
congress
had
no
intent
to
abandon
its
retroactive
effect.
the
very
section
which
i
referred
to
you
previously,
subsection
(11)
(241)
in
the
first
bill
had
said,
"anyone
who
has
been
convicted
of
a
violation
of
any
law
pertaining
to
narcotics."
following
the
change
in
position,
the
same
time
they
changed
the
position
was
amended
once
in
january
1951.
so
it
read
"is
or
any
time
after
entry
has
been
a
narcotic
addict
or
who
at
any
time
he's
been
convicted
of
violation."
they
made
a
further
change
later
in
1951.
again
revised
to
insert
the
word
"hereafter"
as
to
addicts
and
to
leave
it
at
any
time
as
to
persons
convicted
of
the
offense.

mr.

all
right.
i'll
assume.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that
is
correct.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
would
take
the
prior
facts
the
one
narcotics
conviction,
the
prior
bill
of
congress,
and
say,
had
these
occurred
under
the
new
law
would
he
be
deportable?
had
he
--
had
--
had
these
things
taken
place
in
this
order?
had
he
had
a
narcotics
offense,
some
other
grounds
for
deportation,
a
private
bill
passed
in
his
behalf?
had
they
all
occurred
after
the
1952
act?
would
he
be
deportable?
i
assume
not.
i'm
not
clear
as
the
--
i
--
i
do
not
know
of
the
fact
whether
a
private
bill,
some
private
bill
go
this
way,
some
give
him
a
permanent
residence
status
and
some
relieve
him
of
prior
grounds.
they
may
just
only
deal
with
the
single
narcotics
offense,
for
example,
or
the
other
ground
of
deportation.
but
whereas
a
private
bill
gives
him
on
adjustment
of
status,
gives
an
alien
something
which
if
it
had
occurred
under
the
present
law
would
protect
him
and
protect
you.
the
--
the
241
that's
(d)
does
not
say
the
--
this
is
to
be
applied
notwithstanding,
everything
else
that
may
have
occurred.
it
says
this
is
to
be
applied
notwithstanding,
the
facts
by
reason
of
which
is
in
this
category,
occurred
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
act.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
if
you
take
all
those
reasons
and
put
them
after
the
act,
he
remains
non-deportable.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
right,
and
--
and
subsequent
to
those
facts
you
got
a
private
bill.
and
i
--
i
think
the
entire
--
all
the
facts,
those
that
make
it
nondeportable
as
well
as
deportable,
i'm
judging
by
the
new
law.
and
if
there's
a
thousands
of
cases
which
respondent
fears
that
the
government
had
--
had
found
out
it
has
a
108
cases
they
know
that
are
pending
which
the
retroactive
effect
of
this
act
(inaudible)
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
and
if
i
can
put
your
honor
a
question
--
what
do
you
make
of
the
language
of
section
241?
because
241
(d)
then
means
nothing
all
these
verbs,
the
detailed
care
with
which
had
congress
planned
this,
they
might
just
as
well
step
and
begin
the
statute,
"hereafter
anyone
doing
the
following
things
will
be
deported."
let's
start
that
off.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
also,
if
you
take
respondent's
position
that
a
person
who
has
a
nondeportable
status,
this
is
a
substantive
right,
he
might
say
well
that
other
aliens
has
--
under
the
old
law
i
had
the
right
to
commit,
will
say,
a
violation
of
certain
narcotics
law
without
being
deported.
that's
a
valuable
status.
i
can
do
that
under
the
new
law.
you
can't
change
that
status.
take
that
away
from
me
and
the
new
law
would
not
have
prospective
effect
of
any
alien
in
--
in
this
country
on
the
same
reasoning
that's
the
valuable
condition
i
have
that
i
could
do
certain
things.
alien
here
to
continue
his
illegal
residence
in
united
states
without
being
deported
he
could
under
the
old
law.
he
says,
"i
have
that
right,
it's
protected."
i
say
any
other
alien
could
say
i
have
the
right
to
commit
certain
crimes
under
the
old
law
and
not
be
deported.
my
status
is
being
able
to
continue
those
and
be
protected.section
405
in
its
legislative
history
which
i
may
discuss
in
more
detail
on
the
next
--
on
the
next
case
gives
no
indication
of
any
intent
to
overrule
241.
the
words
"status
and
condition"
which
appear
there
were
put
in
at
the
change
from
the
1940
act
when
applied
only
to
naturalization
proceedings.
are
those
--
the
only
exceptions
of
section
405
are
those
--
the
only
stated
exceptions
adopting
respondent's
position
are
exceptions
to
405
(b).
and
if
i
might
take
the
point
further,
the
words
otherwise
specifically
provided
would
mean
nothing
on
the
respondent's
construction.
the
single
most
dominant
policy
will
be
the
preservation
of
the
status
quo
since
under
his
reading,
there
is
no
stated
exception
to
405
(a).
he
would
apply
the
law
to
say
unless
expressly
stated
to
be
an
exception,
there's
is
no
such
language
anywhere
in
the
act.
mr.
roger
d.

the
pending
deportation
proceedings
were
--
were
inserted
in
the
savings
clause
at
the
time
the
act
was
--
savings
clause
was
moot
and
i
believe
the
old
law
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
it
will
be
governed
by
the
old
law,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
yes,
sir,
they
had.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
oh,
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
i
believe
that
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
let
me
explain.
a
--
a
proceeding
of
this
kind,
deportation
proceeding,
is
not
res
judicata.
this
proceeding,
when
it
was
started,
was
adequate
grounds
for
deportation.
there
were
(inaudible)
two
crimes
involving
moral
turpitude.
while
the
proceeding
was
pending,
he
received
a
conditional
pardon,
which
under
that
law,
was
ground
that
the
case
was
--
the
case
was
stopped.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
--
if
i
may
correct
any
--
the
proceeding
would
be
continued
as
a
valid
proceeding
in
effect.
i
--
i
construe
the
new
deportation
provisions.
the
ground
as
being
retroactive,
back
and
they
could
then
amend
the
proceeding,
put
in
grounds
as
to
this
person
which
should
be
valid.
the
proceeding
will
continue.
it's
not
a
--
we
don't
chop
the
things
off.
the
--
the
validity
of
the
proceeding
is
to
continue
but
the
grounds
under
which
he
could
be
deported,
even
someone
who
had
a
pending
proceeding,
would
be
those
--
include
those
in
the
new
act.
mr.

i'm
sorry,

i'm
glad
