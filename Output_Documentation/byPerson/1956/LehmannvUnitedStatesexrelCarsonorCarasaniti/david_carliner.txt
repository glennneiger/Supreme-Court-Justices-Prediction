mr.
david
carliner
may
it
please
the
court.
as
we
hear
the
government's
oral
presentation
this
afternoon,
and
as
we
read
its
briefs
not
only
on
the
carson
case
but
in
the
catalanotte
case
which
follows,
we
hear
only
two
ideas.
the
first
argument
that
the
government
makes
is
that
retrospectivity
of
section
241
(d)
and
of
the
other
section
of
provisions
of
section
241
in
and
of
itself
constitutes
an
exception
to
the
savings
clause.
for
reasons
which
i
shall
develop,
we
believe
this
is
only
the
beginning
of
the
argument,
neither
the
end
of
the
argument
nor
the
answer
to
the
question
which
the
court
is
concerned
with
as
the
government
has
sought
to
make
it.
the
second
argument,
it
seems
to
me,
is
one
of
the
less
sapient
ideas
ever
to
have
emanated
from
the
solicitor
general's
office
and
that
is,
that
the
question
whether
an
alien
is
deportable
or
nondeportable,
does
not
present
a
question
of
status.
now,
apart
from
the
broad
sweep
of
the
language
of
the
savings
clause
which
this
court
had
discussed
in
the
menasche
case,
the
solicitor
general
comes
to
this
issue
like
a
lexicographer,
not
even
as
a
dictionary
but
with
senate
legislative
history
trying
to
make
the
word
"status"
a
word
of
art.
now,
it
is
clear
that
by
use
of
the
word
"status,"
by
use
of
the
word
"condition,"
by
use
of
the
very
broad
phraseology
in
the
section
405
of
the
1952
act,
congress
had
no
such
intent
that
it
was
to
be
restricted
as
a
word
of
art.
the
act
at
dozens
of
places
refers
to
the
position
of
an
alien
who
is
deport
--
who
was
pure
lawfully
and
one
who
therefore
by
the
outburst
meaning
who
is
here
not
lawfully
as
a
question
of
status.
in
section
244
itself,
the
suspension
of
deportation
provisions
congress
has
referred
to
the
position
of
an
alien
who
is
deportable
being
adjusted
to
the
position
of
an
alien
who
shall
no
longer
be
deportable
as
a
question
of
status.
so,
i
shall
not
dwell
long
on
that
argument.
we
should
concentrate
most
of
our
attention
on
what
is
the
essential,
the
key
issue
before
the
court,
and
that
is
whether
the
provisions
in
section
241
and
particularly
in
241
(d),
which
make
the
act
admittedly
retrospective
in
many
features
is
the
specific
provision
which
is
intended
by
section
405
(a)
of
the
savings
clause
and
meets
--
meet
the
degree
of
specificity
which
is
required.
at
the
outset,
we
believe
that
mr.
justice
clark
in
speaking
for
the
court
in
the
schaumburg
decision,
has
disposed
of
all
the
government
has
had
to
say
on
this
issue.
in
that
decision,
mr.
justice
clark
stated
that
if
the
grounds
for
deportation
are
the
same
under
the
prior
law,
as
under
the
new
act,
then
nothing
in
the
new
act
affects
the
petitioner.
only
where
there's
something
in
the
new
act
which
introduces
a
change
thereby,
affecting
one's
status
under
the
old
law
is
the
savings
clause
called
into
play.
only
then
is
a
specific
exception
to
405
required.
now,
the
case
which
the
court
has
before
it,
it
is
only
because
section
241
(a)
(1)
of
the
1952
act
eliminated
the
statute
of
limitations
with
respect
to
stowaways
and
was
only
because
section
241
(a)
(1)
by
its
language
is
admittedly
retrospective.
it
is
only
because
section
241
(b)
removed
the
immunity
to
deportation
which
had
obtained
previously
for
aliens
who
had
conditional
pardons
for
crimes
involving
moral
turpitude
and
it
is
only
because
section
241
(d)
in
the
act
makes
the
provisions
of
the
foregoing
clauses
in
section
241
retrospective
that
the
offenses
which
this
alien
has
committed
have
become
deportable
offenses
under
the
new
act,
not
under
the
old
act.
it
is
only
then
that
the
savings
clause
becomes
operative.
so
far
from
being
an
exception
to
the
savings
clause,
all
of
the
--
all
of
the
language
which
the
government
has
set
forth
in
his
reply
brief
in
blackface
type
and
all
of
the
argument
which
the
government
has
made
to
your
honors
this
afternoon,
far
from
being
the
exceptions
as
i
say,
those
very
provisions
had
been
what
have
triggered
the
savings
clause
into
action.
for
this
reason
alone,
not
section
241
(a)
(1),
not
section
241
(a)
(4),
and
not
section
241
(d)
can
be
construed
to
be
exceptions
to
the
savings
clause.
but
we
feel
that
we
have
more
than
the
logic
of
the
case
on
our
side.
we
have
what
we
feel
is
the
specific
legislative
history
of
the
1952
act.
mr.
david
carliner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
carliner
well,
your
honor,
i
can
say
in
reply
to
your
question
that
the
--
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service,
when
this
act
is
under
consideration,
thought
that
the
proper
clause
was
not
reproached
notwithstanding,
provisions
of
section
405.
and
they've
made
that
specific
reference
and
that
specific
suggestion
with
regard
to
405
(b)
and
i
was
intending
to
draw
upon
that
later.
now,
i
do
not
argue
as
mr.
justice
burton
seems
to
suggest
in
his
question
to
mr.
fisher
earlier
that
we
need
to
have
an
express
provision
correlating
it
to
section
405.
i
think
that
a
general
reference
to
the
prior
law
may
have
obtained
notwithstanding
the
provisions
of
the
prior
law
and
notwithstanding
the
provisions
of
the
savings
clause
without
referring
specifically
to
it
by
number.
mr.
david
carliner
well,
in
some
way,
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
that
congress
because
it
put
in
the
savings
clause
at
a
later
time
would
have
had
to
indicate
that
241
(d)
was
intended
to
be
an
exceptions
of
the
savings
clause
other
than
by
the
very
language
which
they
--
which
they
had
been
using
all
along.
mr.
david
carliner
and
i
shall
explain
my
reasons
for
that,
mr.
justice
burton,
if
i
may.
now,
as
i
was
saying
this
for
its
version
of
the
legislative
history,
all
the
government
has
had
to
show
is
the
sharp
hostility
which
it
says
and
admittedly
it
is
true
that
congress
had
for
stowaways
and
its
intent
to
effect
deportation
provisions
retrospectively.
but
what
is
relative
to
the
issue
are
not
the
general
hostility
to
stowaways
or
its
attitude
toward
narcotics
or
whether
they
wished
to
have
the
retrospective
effect
of
the
law,
but
what
is
--
what
is
essential
is
whether
intended
241
(d)
to
be
a
specific
exception
to
405
of
the
savings
clause.
now,
as
my
brother
fisher
has
pointed
out,
the
genesis
of
the
immigration
nationality
act
was
senate
bill
3455
which
was
introduced
by
senator
mccarran
in
the
81st
congress
in
april
of
1950.
it
was
the
culmination
of
three
or
four
years
of
study
of
immigration
laws
and
is
intended
to
be
a
codification
of
all
that
had
gone
before.
now
it
is
very
significant
that
in
that
statute
congress
omitted
--
and
this
that
my
brother
fisher
has
pointed
out,
it
omitted
a
savings
clause
with
respect
to
deportation
provisions.
and
it
was
more
than
an
omission
and
unconscious
omission
because
the
1917
immigration
act
did
have
a
savings
clause
with
respect
to
deportation
offenses
which
carried
forward
as
mr.
justice
clark
summarized
the
history
of
savings
clause
as
in
the
menasche
case.
now,
when
senator
mccarran
introduced
senate
bill
3455
he,
it
would
seem
to
me
by
the
very
fact
that
it
was
omitted
from
the
deportation
provisions,
omitted
that
with
regard
to
deportation
and
confined
it
solely
to
naturalization
and
nationality.
and
it
was
included
in
title
3
and
made
applicable
only
with
regard
to
the
matter
set
forth
in
title
3
namely,
naturalization
and
nationality
matters.
now,
one
would
--
now
in
the
--
the
second
bill
bearing
on
the
issue
was
senate
bill
716
which
was
introduced
some
nine
months
later
in
the
81st
congress.
now,
my
brother
fisher
seems
to
indicate
that
it
was
a
simply
a
matter
of
moving
it
from
one
title
to
another
title.
but
it
was
far
from
that
because
it
was
introduced
in
716,
the
language
of
it
was
changed,
whereas,
before
the
savings
clause
said
nothing
contained
in
this
title
unless
otherwise
specifically
provided
therein
and
so
on.
when
it
was
put
in
title
4
of
the
act
in
the
miscellaneous
title,
the
clause
stated,
nothing
contained
in
this
act
shall
etcetera.
now,
obviously,
to
change
the
word
from
title
to
act
is
more
than
a
question
of
moving
it
from
one
house
to
another.
it's
giving
the
savings
clause
a
much
larger
umbrella,
one
which
covers
not
only
deportation
but
exclusion
in
all
the
other
provisions
in
the
--
in
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
now,
one
would
suppose
that
at
section
241
(d)
or
any
provisions
in
section
241
were
intended
to
be
an
exception
to
the
savings
clause
that
that
phrase,
that
clause
would
have
come
into
the
act
at
the
same
time
that
the
savings
clause
was
made
applicable
to
the
act
at
large.
as
my
brother
fisher
has
pointed
out,
section
241
(d)
was
there
all
along.it
was
there
at
the
very
beginning
when
there
was
no
applicability
of
the
savings
clause
to
deportation
offenses.
now,
for
the
purpose
--
and
i'm
directing
myself
now
to
the
questions
which
mr.
justice
burton
and
mr.
justice
harlan
had
asked.
the
purpose
we
feel
of
section
241
(d)
was
at
least
two-fold.
its
first
purpose
and
we
insist
on
this
very
strongly
and
we
believe
that
the
question
which
--
that
my
brother
fisher
has
directed
to
mr.
justice
harlan
is
based
on
a
false
premise
and
is
an
error.
the
first
purpose
of
the
act
of
241
(d)
was
to
continue
the
deportability
of
those
aliens
who
were
deportable
under
the
prior
statute.
now,
we
say
that
was
necessary
because
section
403
of
the
act
repealed
all
prior
immigration
laws.
to
say
that
title
1
of
--
109
of
title
1,
the
general
savings
clause,
would
be
applicable
to
deportation
provisions
is
a
novel
and
a
fresh
suggestion.
it
has
never
been
relied
upon
by
the
immigration
service.
we
doubt
very
much
whether
that
congress
intended
it.
the
109
says
very
specifically
that
it's
applicable
to
penalties,
forfeitures
and
liabilities.
now,
this
court
has
said
much
to
our
chagrin,
as
attorneys
for
aliens,
that
a
deportation
is
not
a
penalty
or
a
forfeiture
and
that
we
have
urged
that
upon
the
court
and
with
respect
to
the
ex
post
facto
argument.
whether
it
is
a
liability
is
far
from
certain.
and
i'm
certain
--
if
i
am
certain
of
anything
that
the
general
savings
clause
was
not
relied
upon
by
senator
mccarran
when
he
deleted
the
savings
clause
from
the
deportation
provisions
of
the
bill.
if
that
were
so,
even
if
we
assume
the
correctness
of
the
government's
argument,
the
very
fact
that
in
the
second
bill,
in
senate
bill
716,
the
savings
clause
was
made
applicable
to
deportation
matters,
we
believe
is
an
argument
which
is
a
grease
to
our
mill
because
the
general
savings
clause,
the
title
1
savings
clause,
is
one
which
--
is
a
one
way
street
in
favor
of
the
government.
it
permits
the
government
to
conduct
prosecutions
and
suits
and
proper
action
for
penalties,
liabilities
and
forfeitures.
but
the
savings
clause
in
405
protects
both
the
government
and
the
alien.indeed,
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
to
this
court
in
the
menasche
case
indicated
that
was
the
very
purpose
of
the
savings
clause,
to
protect
the
public
as
well
as
the
government.
so,
if
that
argument
of
the
government
be
correct
we
feel
that
it
supports
our
proposition
that
405
was
intended
to
protect
an
alien.
but
we
believe
that
not
only
this
241
(d)
was
made
necessary
to
continue
forward
the
old
grounds
of
deportability,
but
it
was
needed
to
support
deportability
even
under
the
new
act.
and
this
we
believe
is
very
important
because
far
from
being
a
nullity,
241
(d),
if
it
were
absent
from
the
act,
would
make
the
deportation
provisions
which
the
government
takes
to
enforce
some
of
them
a
novelty
–
a
nullity.
now,
there
are
some,
we've
been
told
there
are
some
700
grounds
of
deportation
set
forth
in
the
new
statute
and
it's
very
difficult
in
a
half
hour
to
go
into
and
--
and
apply
immigration
law
session
to
apply
each
one
of
the
700
grounds
with
respect
to
restrospectivity.
i
will
discuss,
however,
very
limitedly
the
applicability
of
241
(a)
(4)
which
is
the
section
that
the
court
is
concerned
with
in
our
case
if
241
(d)
were
missing
from
the
statute.
suppose
an
alien
entered
the
united
states
in
1950
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
and
committed
a
deportable
offense,
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude
within
five
years
from
1950.
suppose,
he
committed
it
1953,
as
241
(a)
(4)
reads,
"it
provides
that
an
alien
shall
be
deported
who
is
convicted
of
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude
committed
within
five
years
after
entry."
the
very
first
problem
the
government
would
have
is
a
problem
of
the
word
"entry."
normally
a
--
any
statute
is
construed
prospectively.
if
two
--
if
the
first
section
of
241
(a)
--
241
(d)
were
not
in
the
statute,
namely,
the
one
providing
that
entry
shall
be
an
entry
notwithstanding,
that
the
alien
entered
the
united
states
prior
to
the
date
of
enactment
of
this
act,
an
alien
who
entered
in
1950
but
who
committed
a
deportable
offense
in
1953
could
not
be
reached
by
this
provision
without
241
(d)'s
first
section.
suppose
a
second
case.
an
alien
entered
the
united
states
in
1930.
he
commits
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude
in
1945.
15
years
after
his
entry,
he's
not
deportable
under
the
old
statute.
he
commits
a
second
crime
involving
moral
turpitude
in
1954,
that
being
after
the
date
of
the
new
act.
unless
241
(d)
was
there
to
make
the
--
the
second
section
of
it
notwithstanding,
the
facts
by
reason
of
which
he
would
belong
in
(a)
(4),
unless
that
were
in
there,
that
alien
could
not
be
deported
under
the
new
act.
so
we
believe
that
241
(d),
as
we
construe
it,
is
no
nullity
at
all.
that
it
was
there
for
the
very
express
purpose
of
continuing
all
the
grounds
of
deportability
and
of
making
effective
the
deportation
provisions
under
the
new
act.
there's
an
additional
reason.
as
the
government's
appendix
has
pointed
out,
there
are
many
time
sequences
set
forth
in
241
(a)
(1).
some
were
hereafter.some
were
has-beens.
some
were
at
the
time
of
entry.
some
were
at
anytime.
241
(d),
we
submit,
is
a
general
clause
designed
to
make
it
clear
that
with
respect
to
the
new
law,
congress
wanted
it
to
be
retrospective
except
as
the
time
sequence
in
80
--
at
241
(a)
provided
a
different
provision.
so,
we
think
that
the
savings
clause
can
be
construed
consistently
with
241
(d)
and
at
the
same
time
keeping
241
(d)
far
from
a
nullity
but
an
implement
of
providing
deportation
for
the
alien.
now,
there's
a
footnote
to
our
legislative
history
which
we
think
is
very
significant.
and
i
comment
upon
it
because
the
government
keep
--
keeps
dangling
the
phrase
“magical
passwords”
before
us
in
order
to
overcome
the
lack
of
specificity
in
241
(d).
in
its
reply
brief,
the
government
has
stated
on
page
6
that
the
origin
of
the
savings
clause
is
part
of
the
naturalization
provisions
also
explains
why
it
is
only
in
the
naturalization
sections
of
the
1952
act
that
there
are
stated
exceptions
to
the
savings
clause
and
then
only
to
section
405
(b).
now,
i
can
state
categorically
upon
the
basis
of
the
legislative
analysis
which
has
been
lodged
with
the
court,
that
this
is
just
not
so.
the
original
bill,
senate
bill
3455
contained
within
it
an
explanation
of
the
origin
of
that
phrase
and
of
the
origin
of
the
--
of
the
introduction
of
notwithstanding,
section
405
(b)
into
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
as
i've
indicated
in
section
3455,
the
savings
clause
was
applicable
only
to
the
naturalization
provisions.
at
that
time,
section
3455
had
a
provision
at
section
310
of
senate
bill
3455,
which
would
--
which
made
petitions
for
naturalization,
people
who
were
eligible
notwithstanding,
their
race
or
their
marriage.
and
this
language
is
in
this
provision.
this
section
and
i
call
this
to
your
honors
attention
in
order
that
the
court
may
note
the
difference
between
the
specificity
in
this
clause
and
the
lack
of
specificity
in
section
241
(d).
and
the
language
says,
and
this
appears
in
senate
bill
3455,
"this
section
shall
apply
to
any
person
whose
petition
for
naturalization
shall
hereafter
be
filed
or
shall
have
had
been
pending
on
the
effective
date
of
the
act."
now,
in
it
--
in
its
analysis
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
has
this
to
say.
the
last
section
of
section
310
of
the
bill
will
make
section
310
applicable
to
petitions
filed
after
the
effective
date
of
the
bill,
as
well
as
those
pending
when
the
bill
was
enacted.
and
this
is
what
i
call
your
honors
attention
to.
in
order
to
avoid
any
possible
conflict
with
section
361
(b)
of
the
bill,
which
was
the
savings
clause,
it
is
suggested
that
there
be
inserted
at
the
beginning
of
line
5,
page
160,
of
the
phrase,
"notwithstanding,
that
section
361
(b)."
that
was
done.
it
was
done
in
between
senate
bill
3455
and
senate
bill
716.
now,
as
i
previously
observed,
senate
bill
716
had
the
savings
clause
applicable
to
the
entire
act
including
the
deportation
provisions.
that
time,
the
--
the
general
counsel
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
went
over
that
bill
with
a
fine-tooth
comb
and
the
general
counsel
made
the
very
same
suggestion
with
regard
to
331
(d)
of
senate
bill
716.
and
at
that
--
and
he
said
in
order
to
avoid
any
--
the
language
of
331
(d)
was
identical
with
the
language
of
section
310,
and
the
general
counsel
of
immigration
service
said,
in
order
to
avoid
any
conflict
of
the
savings
clause,
it
is
suggested
that
on
such
and
such
line
and
page,
immediately
preceding
a
certain
sentence,
there'd
be
inserted
the
clause,
"notwithstanding
the
provisions
of
section
405
(b)."
this,
your
honors,
was
at
a
time
that
the
savings
clause
was
made
applicable
to
the
deportation
provisions.
congress
complied
with
this
suggestion.
and
not
only
did
it
comply
with
that
suggestion
but
it
went
through
the
entire
act
when
the
savings
clause
was
applicable
to
the
entire
act
and
it
added
those
magical
passwords
in
all
the
sections
where
it
now
appears.
now,
we
think
it
is
anomalous
more
than
that,
we
think
it
is
an
irony
occasioned
perhaps
more
about
the
desire
to
win
the
case
than
it
is
to
be
right.
that
the
very
author
of
those
phrase,
who
thought
they
were
necessary
in
a
clause
which
is
far
less
ambiguous
than
section
241
(d),
should
now
say
that
they
were
not
needed
at
all.
now,
besides
the
history,
the
legislative
history
and
this
footnote
to
the
legislative
history
which
i
have
cited,
we
feel
that
the
language
of
the
savings
clause
itself
read
together
with
the
relevant
provisions
of
241
proved
that
nothing
in
241
is
an
exception
to
the
clause.
the
government's
approach
to
this
issue,
we
feel,
suffers
because
they
regard
the
savings
clause
as
a
kind
of
barrel
into
which
you
put
things
and
out
of
which
you
take
things
rather
than
looking
at
it
as
a
series
of
separate
and
discrete
concepts.
now,
the
first
part
of
the
savings
clause
states
that
nothing
except
in
this
act,
except
as
otherwise
specifically
provided,
shall
affect
and
a
whole
series
of
things
are
listed
one
of
which,
i
shall
note
in
passing,
are
acts
done
at
the
time
that
this
act
shall
take
effect.
now,
one
of
the
acts
done
would
be
as
mr.
justice
harlan
has
pointed
out,
an
act
passed
by
congress.
and
i
don't
believe
that
my
brother
fisher
has
answered
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
adequately
because
congress
is
passing
--
passes
legislation
all
the
time
regarding
aliens
who
have
entered
the
united
states
illegally
or
who
have
entered
here
legally
and
has
committed
deportable
offenses
and
they
have
said
notwithstanding,
those
offenses,
they
shall
be
regarded
as
legal
residents
of
united
states.
now,
that
is
an
act
done
by
congress.
241
(d)
would
go
behind
that
and
say
that
notwithstanding,
the
fact
that
he
entered
the
united
states
prior
to
the
date
of
the
act,
even
though
congress
may
have
passed
the
law.
notwithstanding,
he
has
committed
the
deportable
offense,
he
shall
be
--
the
provisions
of
section
241
making
him
deportable,
shall
apply.
so,
there's
one
section
in
section
241
(d)
which
provides
for
a
specific
provision
to
affect
a
status,
a
condition
or
acts
done.
now,
the
respondent
carson
had
such
an
act
done.
in
1945,
the
attorney
general
terminated
his
immigration
proceedings
because
by
virtue
of
his
conditional
pardon
by
the
governor
of
ohio,
he
was
no
longer
deportable.
that
act
done,
we
believe,
by
operation
of
the
savings
clause,
has
continuing
validity.
it
says
proceedings
shall
be
continued
to
--
and
in
fact
as
otherwise
provided
the
proceeding
shall
be
continued
to
be
valid.now,
the
chief
justice
has
indicated,
it
would
matter
not
if
this
--
if
a
alien
had
been
subjected
to
deportation
proceedings
which
are
pending
when
the
act
was
passed,
but
to
say
that
those
proceedings
are
legal
or
valid,
but
to
say
that
the
--
that
the
new
law
shall
govern
because
those
proceedings
cannot
be
valid
under
the
old
law.
the
answer
which
my
brother
fisher
has
given
to
the
chief
justice
question,
i
believe,
vitiate
the
legality
of
the
proceeding
if
it
is
to
say
that
the
person
can
be
charged
during
dependency
of
a
valid
proceeding
under
the
new
law
with
a
--
with
a
deportable
offense
under
the
new
law.
it
calls
to
mind
the
reasons
of
dallas
case
in
which
the
attempt
was
made
to
put
things
under
the
--
in
the
savings
clause
which
operated
in
the
future.
in
the
same
sense,
i
believe
that
my
brother
fisher
is
trying
to
put
a
new
deportation
offense
in
the
savings
clause
to
operate
a
continuing
and
old
deportation
proceeding.
but
there's
a
--
an
additional
requirement
in
section
405
and
we
think
it
is
significant
because
congress
must
have
thought
it
was
significant.
when
section
405
was
first
written
and
included
in
--
as
a
savings
clause
in
as
361
(b)
of
the
senate
bill
3455,
it
had
only
one
clause
which
read,
"except
as
otherwise
specifically
provided."
but
when
it
was
put
into
title
4
of
the
savings
clause
and
made
applicable
to
the
statute
as
a
whole,
it
--
it
added
an
additional
"except
as
otherwise
provided
clause."
the
first
part
of
the
sentence
relates
to
declarations
of
intention,
warrants
of
arrests,
orders
of
deportation,
statuses
and
so
on;
but
as
to
all
such
prosecutions
et
cetera,
the
statutes
or
parts
of
statutes
repealed
by
this
act
are
–
and
i
emphasize
--
unless
otherwise
specifically
provided
therein,
hereby
continued
in
force
and
effect.
now,
that
second
"except
as
otherwise
specifically
provided
herein"
did
not
appear
in
senate
bill
3455.
it
was
not
added
to
the
bill
until
716
when
it
was
made
applicable
to
the
act
as
a
whole.
now,
we
believe
that
this
indication
and
intent
by
congress
to
reinforce
and
to
strengthen
the
continuation
of
the
applicability
of
the
old
law.
otherwise,
there
would
have
been
no
reason
to
have
added
this
additional
specific
provision.
now,
there
two
other
provisions
in
the
savings
clause
which
pointed
out,
we
believe,
the
absurdity
and
the
error
of
the
government's
argument.
it
has
failed
to
observe
that
there
are
two
dates,
two
conflicting
dates
here.
the
savings
clause
--
mr.
david
carliner
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
david
carliner
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
we
developed
two
arguments
that
section
241
does
not
bear
upon
the
issue
whether
the
old
law
or
the
new
law
governs
the
respondent's
case.
our
first
argument
as
this
court
may
recall
was
that
because
the
clauses
upon
which
the
government
rely
in
section
241
are
the
very
changes
in
the
law
which
this
court
said
in
the
schaumburg
decision,
called
the
savings
clause
into
play,
they
cannot
be
construed
to
the
exceptions
to
the
savings
clause.
our
second
argument
was
that
the
legislative
history
of
section
241
and
of
section
405
together
with
the
congressional
reliance
upon
the
phrase,
“notwithstanding
section
405
(b),”
which
the
government
itself
originated,
offered
and
proposed
to
congress,
indicates
that
section
241
(d)
in
the
language
of
menashe
was
not
within
the
specific
contemplation
of
congress
when
it
enacted
that
legislation
and
when
it
enacted
the
savings
clause.
the
argument
that
i
had
developed
on
that
point
has
not
been
set
forth
in
our
brief.
but
for
the
convenience
of
the
court,
i
direct
your
honors'
attention
to
the
fact
that
it's
been
set
forth
in
the
appendix
of
the
government's
brief
in
the
schaumburg
case,
number
48
in
1940
--
pardon
me,
1954
term
at
pages
58
and
at
pages
62
of
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief
in
that
case.
our
argument
with
regard
to
the
phrase,
“notwithstanding
section
405
(b),”
i
wish
to
make
clear
particularly
because
of
mr.
justice
burton's
question
is
not
that
that
specific
phrase
is
necessary
in
order
to
make
241
(d)
an
exception
to
the
savings
clause.
although,
as
the
legislative
draftsman,
the
implications
of
these
phrases
are
not
fully
developed
by
me,
but
i
would
suggest
in
response
to
mr.
justice
burton
that
perhaps
this
phrase
might
have
served
the
purpose
--
would
have
indicated
that
the
savings
clause
was
within
the
specific
contemplation
of
congress
and
it
would
cover
the
point
that
the
--
and
the
position
of
the
government
seeks
to
maintain
to
reach
aliens
who
are
not
deportable
under
the
new
and
old
law
but
to
make
them
deportable
notwithstanding
the
old
law.
and
this
is
the
phrase
that
i
would
suggest
is
that
added
to
section
241,
there'd
be
the
phrase
that
“notwithstanding
that
such
aliens
were
not
deportable
under
the
laws
repealed
by
this
act.”
now,
that
clause
did
not
refer
specifically
to
the
savings
clause,
but
i
think
that
it
has
the
virtue
of
having
a
specific
contemplation
that
people
who
are
not
deportable
under
the
prior
law
shall
nevertheless
be
deportable
under
the
new
statute
notwithstanding
the
provisions
of
the
savings
clause.
now,
the
third
argument
which
i
was
in
the
process
of
developing
yesterday
at
the
recess
was
that
the
language
of
the
relevant
provision
of
section
241
and
the
405
proves
the
correctness
of
the
decisions
below.
i
had
noted
that
the
section
--
that
the
second
clause
of
section
405
requiring
that
there
be
a
specific
provision
otherwise,
less
the
repealed
statute
should
continue
to
govern
was
added
to
the
statute
after
the
first
specific
provision
otherwise
was
in
the
statute
and
that
its
purpose,
the
very
fact
it
was
added
subsequently
must
have
clearly
to
indicate
that
congress
wanted
to
reinforce
the
intent
that
prior
proceedings,
prior
statuses,
prior
conditions,
continue
to
be
in
effect.
i
had
noted
that
with
its
barrel-like
approach
to
the
savings
clause,
the
government
had
overlooked
the
distinct
requirements
of
the
savings
clause,
one
of
them
being
the
fact
that
there
were
two
otherwise
specifically
provided
clauses
in
the
savings
clause.
perhaps
the
best
way
to
demonstrate
our
point
on
this,
if
the
court
will
permit,
is
to
examine
the
hintopoulos
case
which
this
court
decided
on
monday.
now,
in
the
hintopoulos
case,
the
aliens
entered
the
united
states
illegally.
it
was
found
in
1951
because
when
they
entered,
they
entered
with
the
intent
of
being
immigrants
and
they
had
no
immigrant
visas
in
their
possession
in
the
time
of
entry.
the
deportation
proceedings
in
the
hintopoulos
case
were
began
in
may
of
1952
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
1952
act.
and
accordingly,
the
basis
of
their
deportation
was
the
old
statute,
the
1924
statute.
now,
the
government
must
concede
and
that
was
the
way
it
conducted
the
hintopoulos
case,
these
aliens
were
deportable
under
the
prior
statute.
now,
these
proceedings
were
pending
when
congress
enacted
the
1952
statute
and
pending
on
the
effective
date
of
the
1952
statute.
now,
under
the
government's
concept
of
this
position,
they
would
concede,
first
of
all
that
the
old
proceedings
are
valid
to
deport
the
hintopouloses.
they
would
say
however,
that
if
they
were
not
deportable
under
the
old
law
that
1952,
they
were
to
be
deportable
under
the
new
law,
then
the
old
law
would
not
govern
but
the
new
law
would
govern.
that
would
mean
very
simply
that
those
proceedings
which
they're
saying
on
the
one
hand
are
valid
are
not
valid
any
longer
and
that
you
could
in
the
middle
of
the
proceedings
regard
it
as
no
longer
valid
and
as
mr.
fisher
said
yesterday,
in
the
very
same
proceedings
which
they
say
which
the
statute
says
specifically
shall
continue
to
have
validity.
and
as
to
which
the
repealed
statute
shall
continue
to
be
enforced
that
in
those
proceedings,
they
could
launch
a
new
charge
making
the
hintopouloses
deportable
under
the
new
law.
now
that,
i
submit,
does
not
conform
with
the
meaning
or
the
intent
of
the
savings
clause.
it
would
make
the
savings
clause
meaningless.
it
would
make
a
complete
nullity
of
mr.
justice
douglas
as
suggested
by
his
question,
it
would
completely
swallow
up.
it
would
make
241
(d)
completely
swallow
up
the
savings
clause.
there's
another
reason
why
the
government's
position
is
anomalous
here
because
the
hintopouloses
applied
for
suspension
of
deportation.
they
conceded
in
the
argument
to
this
court
on
that
issue
and
the
court
has
ruled
in
mr.
justice
harlan's
opinion
that
the
old
law
governs
suspension
of
deportation.
but
what
an
incongruity
it
is
to
say
on
the
one
hand
that
the
old
law
should
govern
the
suspension
of
deportation
but
that
during
that
very
proceeding,
the
new
law
shall
be
--
shall
govern
the
deportability
itself.
it
just
doesn't
conform
to
the
congressional
intent
or
the
language
with
regards
to
the
saving
clause.
now,
there
are
two
other
provisions
in
this
language
which
the
government
in
looking
at
the
barrel
and
now
that
it
stays
has
overlooked
with
regard
to
the
savings
clause.
first
of
all,
they
have
failed
to
see
that
the
effective
date
of
the
savings
clause
is
not
the
date
of
the
enactment
of
the
act
but
the
--
but
the
effective
date
of
the
act.
the
effective
date
of
the
act
was
december
26th,
1952.
what
they
have
overlooked
is
that
the
operative
date
in
section
241
(d)
is
not
the
effective
date
of
the
act
but
the
date
of
enactment
of
the
act.
now,
the
date
of
the
enactment
of
the
act
was
six
months
earlier.
it
was
june
27th,
1952,
so
we
have
the
rather
curious
position
by
the
government's
construction
of
this
law
of
creating
a
time
sanctuary
for
aliens
who
became
deportable
after
june
27,
1952
but
before
december
26th,
1952.
now,
whatever
the
congressional
intent
was,
surely
it
was
not
to
say
that
aliens
who
became
deportable
after
december
26th,
1952
shall
be
deportable
under
the
new
law
that
aliens
who
were
deportable
between
--
before
june
27,
1952
shall
be
deportable
under
the
old
law.
and
that
aliens
who
became
deportable
between
june
27th
of
1952
--
june
27th
and
december
26th
of
1952
shall
be
governed
by
the
new
law,
i
would
suppose
because
they're
not
accepted
from
the
savings
clause.
now,
these
aliens
who
have
committed
deportable
offenses
between
that
period,
therefore,
would
have
acquired
a
kind
of
refuge
within
the
period
of
that
six
months
which
is
obviously
a
position
which
we
cannot
attribute
to
congress.
there
is
a
second
provision
on
the
savings
clause
which
demonstrates,
i
think
not
only
the
error
of
the
government's
position
but
if
i
may
say
this,
the
absurdity
of
it.
on
page
14
of
its
reply
brief,
the
government
seeks
to
deliver
the
coup
de
grace
to
our
argument
and
they
say
as
if
it
were
completely
absurd
and
ridiculous
concept,
they
say
this.
it's
the
last
sentence
and
it
doesn't
have
an
exclamation
point
but
it's
written
as
if
it
should
have
a
couple
of
exclamation
points.
thus,
“and
aliens
abroad
could
even
claim
the
preservation
of
a
status
of
admissibility.”
well,
that
is
exactly
what
the
1952
statute
provides,
because
section
405
has
in
it
and
this
was
added
by
congressman
walter
in
the
house
version
of
the
bill,
h.r.
2359
and
was
passed
by
the
house,
h.r.
5678
and
was
thereafter
added
to
the
senate
versions
of
the
bill.
it
provides
in
it,
and
i'm
reading
from
the
clause,
“when
an
immigrant
in
possession
of
unexpired
immigrant
visa
issued
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
this
act
makes
applications
for
admission,
his
admissibility
shall
be
determined
under
the
provisions
of
law
in
effect
on
the
date
of
the
issuance
of
such
visa.”
now,
that
clearly
says
that
a
man
who
got
a
visa
before
the
act
was
--
was
made
effective
shall
be
admissible
to
the
united
states
even
though
the
1952
act
may
make
him
excludable,
he
shall
be
admissible
under
the
old
law.
now,
the
government
says
that
that
is
not
so,
but
they
were
apparently
overlooked
of
that
particular
clause.
now,
the
effect
of
the
government's
argument
is
this.
that
an
alien
cannot
be
excluded
from
the
united
states
because
he
got
his
visa
under
the
old
law
but
when
he
gets
here,
when
he
arrives
in
new
york
and
seeks
to
come
into
the
united
states,
the
immigration
service
cannot
exclude
him
but
as
to
that
moment,
the
new
law
makes
a
new
ground
of
excludability,
he
shall
be
admitted.
but
if
after
he
gets
in,
he
is
excludable
by
the
law
at
the
time
of
entry
under
section
241,
he
can
thereafter
be
deported.
now,
no
matter
how
machiavellian,
the
immigration
service
may
regard
the
82nd
congress
of
united
states,
surely
we
cannot
assume
that
they
wanted
to
admit
an
alien
under
the
old
law
and
then
after
they've
got
here
to
turnaround
and
deport
him.
so,
we
believe
that
these
provisions
taken
together
shows
that
the
construction
which
the
government
urges
upon
this
court
is
not
a
correct
one.
now,
finally,
the
questions
which
mr.
justice
harlan
has
post,
raised
and
we
have
discussed
this
more
fully
in
pages
25
and
28
of
our
brief,
that
if
the
government's
position
is
correct,
suspensions
of
deportation,
adjustments
of
status,
pre-examination,
the
registry
provisions,
all
of
the
discretionary
relief
which
the
attorney
general
can
give
under
the
immigration
nationality
act
would
be
said
it
not,
because
this
discretionary
relief
is
given
for
aliens
by
and
large
who
are
deportable.
now,
if
241
has
within
it
clauses
which
can
go
behind
that
make
them
deportable
not
withstanding
their
time
of
their
entry,
notwithstanding
the
time
of
their
offense,
then
surely,
they
can
be
deported
without
regard
to
it.
the
government's
answer
to
that
is,
"we
will
interpret
it
and
enforce
a
statute
in
a
reasonable
way
that
the
attorney
general
is
a
reasonable
man."
well,
this
court
doesn't
have
to
reach
that
issue
if
it
first
decides
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
was
a
reasonable
congress,
and
that
its
law
was
not
intended
to
permit
extreme
constructions
or
contrary
constructions
by
the
attorney
general.
all
we
need
to
do
is
to
say
that
the
construction
that
we
urge
upon
the
court
in
this
act
is
a
reasonable
construction
and
it
obviates
the
need
of
imposing
upon
the
attorney
general
the
burden
of
behaving
reasonably.
now,
the
government
has
said
also
and
this
appears
at
page
11
of
its
brief
that
“there
is
no
provision
in
section
241
that
it
shall
be
applicable
to
an
alien
falling
within
the
enumerated
classes,
notwithstanding
an
adjustment
of
status,
a
suspension
of
deportation
or
private
bill,”
and
we
read
not
into
it,
but
we
like
that
sentence.
we
would
simply
add
one
additional
clause
that
there's
no
provision
in
section
241
that
it
shall
be
applicable
to
an
alien
notwithstanding
a
prior
status
of
non-deportability.
and
we
feel
that
sentence,
it's
part
--
it's
page
11
of
the
reply
brief.
now,
we
believe
that
the
solicitor
general
would
be
the
last
person
to
urge
that
the
congress
should
be
sought
to
reopen
all
of
these
matters
and
to
deluge
to
the
department
of
justice
with
relitigations
of
thousands
upon
thousands
of
cases.
now,
we
do
not
say
that
they
will
do
it
if
the
court
abides
by
our
decision,
by
our
--
since
construction
of
the
statute
but
it's
within
their
power
to
do
it.
now,
we
believe
that
the
power
is
not
intended
by
congress.
we
believe
that
the
court
in
its
decision
in
the
menashe
case
when
it
said
that
congress
sought
by
its
policy
to
preserve
all
of
the
advantages
which
aliens
had
accrued
under
prior
legislation
that
this
was
just
one
of
those
advantages.
and
one
of
the
reasons
for
it,
we
believe,
although
the
ex
post
facto
argument
is
foreclosed,
congress
recognizes
and
this
court
recognizes
that
the
ex
post
facto
law
that
retrospective
laws
are
harsh
and
unfair.
congress
similarly
realizes
that.
in
many
of
its
deportation
laws,
it
specifically
provided
that
the
operation
shall
be
prospective
only.
in
these
cases,
the
case
that
we
have
before
us,
congress
specifically
provided
a
statue
of
limitations
as
to
deportation.
we
feel
that
by
the
savings
clause,
it
continued
to
preserve
the
status
of
nondeportability
to
an
alien
who
have
obtained
that
advantage
under
the
prior
law.
