john
m.
lehmann,
petitioner,
versus
united
states
of
america
in
relation
to
bruno
carson.
mr.
fisher,
we
might
--
i
will
proceed.
i
was
waiting
for
justice
black
but
he's
delayed
a
little.
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
the
--
at
the
time
of
the
1953
act
went
into
effect
there
was
deportation
proceeding
ending
against
this
man,
what
law
would
he
be
governed
by?
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
without
regard
to
--
to
when
it
was
put
in
there,
what
--
what
would
be
the
effect
on
the
--
on
that
proceeding?
would
it
be
governed
by
the
old
law
or
the
new
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
old
law.
now
in
this
case
the
man
had
had
this
proceeding
and
they
had
decided
that
he
was
not
deportable,
didn't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
now
do
--
do
you
think
that
congress
intended
to
say
that
if
a
man
had
had
his
proceeding
and
--
and
they
had
decided
he
was
not
deportable,
that
he
would
be
governed
by
the
new
act
but
that
if
a
man,
under
the
same
circumstances,
had
a
proceeding
pending
against
him
that
he
would
be
--
he
would
be
governed
by
the
old
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
let's
--
let's
don't
complicate
it
by
that
part.
let's
just
--
let's
just
take
the
case
where
--
where
a
man
is
not
deportable
under
the
--
the
old
law
and
he
had
a
proceeding
pending
against
him
at
the
time
the
new
law
went
into
effect.
you
say
there
that
the
old
law
would
apply.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
you
rather
fine.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
carliner.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
might
still
go
on.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
m.
lehmann,
petitioner,
versus
united
states
of
america
in
relation
to
bruno
carson.
mr.
carliner.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
