justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
--
on
the
basis
of
the
pleading,
what
do
you
concede
to
be
the
precise
holding
made
from
judge
hand's
opinion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
how
do
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
issues
were
tendered
by
the
complaint?
construe
it
as
loosely
as
you
please.
you're
not
aware
of
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
not
only
throwing
out
the
common
law
pleading
right
and
out.
it's
abusive
but
also
the
ultimate
good
privilege
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
be
as
loose
as
you
please
in
what
you
think
the
issue
presented
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well,
but
what
--
how
did
he
construe
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
would
overrule
--
i
wouldn't
quarrel
with
a
ruling
that
this
is
what
a
pleading
mean,
but
what
is
it
that
--
what
was
the
pleading
that
he
had
in
mind
on
the
basis
of
which
he
directed
the
trial
on
the
merits?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
--
the
claim
of
impartiality
was
derived
or
was
it
exclusively
from
the
fact
that
the
--
that
they
designated
that
the
elector
was,
if
you
please,
even
of
a
competitive
union,
was
that
of
uroc.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
nothing
more.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that,
inherent
with
your
situation,
or
ours,
unnecessarily
biased
judgment
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
the
representative
on
the
system
of
the
employee
was
of
a
different
duty,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
only
want
to
be
sure
what
it
is,
that
if
you
--
if
mention
to
us
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
one
situation
and
then
i
can
think
of
some
other,
any
other.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
fact,
that
was
intended
to
be
the
primary
reliance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
kaiser
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i'm
a
little
puzzled
by
your
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
--
your
--
if
you
heard
me,
mr.
kaiser,
that
the
--
i
understand
it
but
it
is
--
that
the
determination
whether
uroc
is
or
isn't
a
national
organization
is
not
administrative,
not
subject
to
court
review,
is
that
right?
there
is
no
resort
that,
in
view
of
the
makeup
of
the
system
board,
it
is
not
to
that
system
board
--
it
is
--
it
is
not
--
the
law
does
not
require
adjudication
of
what
is
a
rival
union,
as
to
the
requirement
that
it
should
be
national,
left
to
be
administrated
by
the
system
board,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
my
difficulty
arises,
as
i
said
initially,
simply
by
your
argument
--
not
by
your
argument
but
by
what
--
by
judge
hand's
opinion.
from
that,
he
immediately
rushes
to
the
conclusion,
as
i
can
see,
that,
there,
the
court
is
caught
reviewing
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
seems
to
me,
they
are
two
very
different
questions
that
you're
talking
about
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
here,
the
courts
have
decide
that
the
statute,
as
such,
allows
for
a
confessor
to
withdraw
this
from
the
administrative
process
doesn't
mean
it
withdraws
this
--
it
withdraws
it
on
the
complaint
in
this
case.
they
are
very
different
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
seem
to
treat
them
all
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
with
great
grievance
suggestion
for
saying
that
there
may
be
court
review.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
deny
that
there
may
be
court
review
if
appropriate
allegations
are
made.
that's
the
steele
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
well,
that
--
if
it's
my
courtroom,
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
will
all
be
clearer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that,
too.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
all
depends.
haven't
they
got
a
chance
to
get
before
the
board,
is
that
door
shut,
too?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
says
if,
because
there's
an
inherent
bias
here,
they
can,
straight
away,
rush
to
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and,
that
doesn't
follow
from
his
prior
reason,
at
least
to
my
mind,
that
there
mere
fact
that
the
statute
is
what
it
is,
the
structure
which
makes
you
go
through
the
system
eventually
through
the
national
board
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
that
may
operate
unfairly,
as
in
the
steele
case.
the
constituents
of
the
board
of
the
union
said,
“yes,
you
represent
me.
your
duty
is
to
represent
me,
but
you
didn't
represent
me
because
you
exercised
that's
a
bias.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
“i
am
here,”
he
says.
from
the
very
nature
of
the
relationship,
the
fact
that
they
belong
to
a
rival
union,
at
once
they
can
go
to
court
because,
inevitably,
these
people
would
have
to
be
biased
judges.
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
aggrieving?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
hardly
talks
about
the
latter.
he
takes
it
for
granted
that
if
you're
not
barred,
if
you
had
--
if
you're
not
barred
from
going
to
the
court,
therefore,
you
can
go
to
the
court
in
every
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and,
that
needs
to
be
approached
and,
on
second
view,
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
to
bear
in
mind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
aren't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
if
you're
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
you're
right.
that,
still,
doesn't
make
it.
suppose
you're
wrong
about
that,
that
would
make
his
decision
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
whom?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
so,
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
statute
must
be
construed
medically
to
seal
the
door
of
any
rival
union
even
though
the
original
union
says
“not
on
your
then
type
will
we
ever
let
you
in.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
what
it
gets
down
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
--
then,
tell
me
how
a
competing
union
can
come
into
existence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
that
crucial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
now,
do
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
it
by
going
secondarily?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
--
they
may
be
the
representative
of
the
rival
unions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then,
how
can
they
be
unfired?
i
don't
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
go
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
had
a
court
--
if
you
had
to
argue
before
a
court,
of
which,
you
knew
one
member
was
absolutely
disqualified
by
his
personal
interest,
it
wouldn't
give
you
any
comfort
to
know
there
are
two
other
members
who
are
not
so
disqualified.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
would
protest
vigorously
against
such
a
constitution
of
a
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
would
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
would
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
could
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
don't
come
to
grips,
mr.
kaiser,
though
we
all
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
not
saying
that
that's
--
that's
my
dissatisfaction,
i
don't
mind
telling
you,
with
judge
hand's
opinion.
i'm
not
saying
that
the
representative
of
the
established
union
must,
by
very
reason
or
by
the
exclusive
reason
of
that
fact,
be
deemed
to
be
a
disqualified
member
of
a
tribunal.
i
am
saying
the
opposite
that
you
must
make
a
showing
of
active
operating
bias
apart
from
that
fact.
in
other
words,
the
steele
case
is
my
--
the
basis
of
my
discussion.
the
union
--
it
was
well
said
and
would
hopefully
be
said
in
the
opening
argument,
a
union
represents
all
sorts
of
dissident
minorities.
mr.
justice
brennan
makes
an
appropriate
--
raises
an
appropriate
question
when
he
said,
“isn't
this
qualitatively
different?”
but,
in
all
events,
waiving
that
--
integration
of
that
for
the
moment.
the
union
represents
all
sorts
of
dissed
members
whether
color
or
their
race,
whether
sex,
sometimes,
whatever
it
is,
but
it
is
the
duty
under
the
act
and,
as
the
steele
case
made
clear
in
a
very
ticklish
situation,
the
representative
of
the
union
or
if
it
were
trustees,
loosely
speaking,
trustees
of
the
interest
of
all
its
members,
although
a
particular
claim
may
be
in
hostility
to
a
majority
view.
therefore,
i
say,
what
you
said
you've
done,
of
course
you've
done
that,
but
it
doesn't
follow
that
if
you
make
out
a
case
of
explicit
directed
bias,
as
in
the
steele
case,
that
you
can't
raise
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
your
point
that
this
is
all
irrelevant
if
your
premise
is
accepted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
just
--
i
don't
agree
with
you
at
all
because
that's
the
steele
case.
the
steele
case
was,
as
a
matter
of
statutory
obstruction,
a
non-reviewable
judicial
problem
but
this
court
said,
where
the
ordinary
machinery
necessarily
works
a
bias,
works
on
the
fairness,
then,
in
privately,
you
have
a
right
to
go
to
the
court
and
say
that
the
--
the
normal
administrative
machinery
by
an
abusive
exercise
of
its
exclusive
power
is
a
function
and
you
can
go
to
a
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
do
agree.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
we
do
not
come
to
grips
and
where
you
ought
to
be
able
to
satisfy
here
that
when
you
say
it
--
there
is,
provided
by
the
statute,
machinery
for
this
interested
determination
of
whether
it
is
a
union
in
scope,
it
seems
to
me
a
duplicate
original
with
the
steele
case
that,
if
persons
can
come
into
court
and
say,
“this
--
this
interested
system
isn't
working
in
the
particular
case
because
of
a
bias
of
one
of
its
members,
then
you
got
an
identical
scheme
situation.
in
my
opinion,
that
isn't
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
only
deny
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
admire
the
way
you
adhere
to
your
point,
mr.
kaiser,
even
though
you,
if
i
may
say
so,
don't
have
to.
alright,
you
may
stick
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
i
indicated
that
throughout
this
discussion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
have
to
rest
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
to
rest
on
that
proposition,
the
fact
that
either
competitor
necessarily
makes
it
an
unfair
procedure,
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
bother
about
decisions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
tell
me
if
that's
your
view.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
how
you
argue
the
merits.
the
counsel
would
state
their
proposition
for,
at
least,
first,
for
that
argument.
some
of
us
would
have
to
be
understanding.
but,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
go
on
then
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
read
cases,
too,
but
i
can't
read
the
mind
of
counsels
unless
they
state
what's
in
their
head.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
expect
you
to
come
here
and
urge
us
to
view
the
secretary
of
labor's
conclusion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
did
this
--
when
did
this
litigation
start?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
did
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
really
is
whether
this
whole
business
is
that
every
effort
to
your
right
may
not
have
a
court
to
decide
these
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
it
should
not
be
denied
here.
the
court
is
biased.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
said
from
the
fact
about
this
issue
and
as
they
did
about
other
relations
with
other
railroads
in
each
side
instead
of
trying
to
go
to
the
tribunals
or
the
congress
or
whatnot
to
get
its
relief
and
ask
the
courts
to
do
it
and
i
think
the
courts
are
properly
very
reluctant
to
try
it.
that's
my
general
view.
justice
felix
frankfurter
qualified
as
an
elector
must
be
of
“national
in
scope”?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
that
was
meant
to
be
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
suggestion
for
the
supporting
suggestion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
like
to
get
the
(inaudible)
in
this
discussion.
suppose
you're
right
that
that
is
the
phrase,
not
a
term
of
art
but
something
that
the
man
--
if
you
ask
a
man
in
the
street
what
he
thinks
about
it
and
hypothesize
as
an
ordinary
man's
meaning
of
“national
in
scope”,
“national
in
scope”,
what
conclusion
do
you
draw
from
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
should
think
you
rely
on
the
highland
case
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
definitely.
now
do
you
think
the
highland
case
does
determine
this
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
determines
a
related
question
but
i
should
think
that
a
provision
in
a
statute
which
applies
to
labor
industrial
railway
generally
as
does
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
indeed
carves
out
industrial
relations
in
the
word
--
in
the
railroad
industry
doesn't
necessarily
or
doesn't
even
persuasive
and
leave
me
to
say
that
fully
accepting
as
i
have
no
trouble
now
that
the
fight
is
over,
fully
accepting
the
court's
decision
that
that
is
a
matter
which
is
not
determined
by
the
expert
(inaudible)
upon
the
national
labor
relations
board.
i
think
you
have
to
go
a
long
way
to
say
that
that
therefore
in
a
statute,
the
phrase
“national
in
scope”,
a
statute
which
as
we
all
know
was
--
was
drafted,
it
was
a
consensual
means
of
legislation
on
which
congress
put
its
rather
staff
at
the
party
degree
but
which
in
any
event
is
restricted
to
a
particular
industry
that
dealing
with
a
regime
for
that
particular
industry,
you
ask
the
man
in
the
street
what
the
term
mean.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
my
opinion
was
the
dissent
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
this
notion,
the
defense
in
the
court
opinion
are
all
the
same
just
grab
a
phrase
from
the
opinion
and
throw
that
to
court
is
something
that
i
shall
resist
as
long
as
i
sit
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
kind
of
bearing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
if
we
agree,
as
we
all
agree
that
the
man
in
the
street,
you
can't
bring
in
the
man
in
the
street,
the
existent,
the
figment
of
the
construed
then
rely
on
these
other
people
who
aren't
a
figment
of
the
imagination
but
real
people.
but
that
makes
you
say
that
you
take
the
specialized
definition
and
saying
it
comes
with
a
generalized
purpose,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
understand
that.
i
can
understand
that
but
i
cannot
--
i'm
talking
about
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
remember
the
highland
case
whether
--
whether
you
should
accept
that.
i
mean,
when
you
appeal
with
(inaudible)
which
is
restricted
to
a
technical
group
of
people,
the
group
of
people
who
have
confined
activity
who
got
an
awful
job
and
of
their
own
and
left
presupposition.
that's
what
they
mean
by
specialized
administration.
that
if
it's
directed
to
the
a
specialized
factor
in
that
industry,
then
you'll
say,
"well,
i
(inaudible)
the
highland
case.”
now
the
district
court,
there,
this
court
held
and
i
accepted
that
--
i
know
--
i
don't
need
to
withhold
anything
or
be
hostile
to
it
or
to
inhibit
it.
i
can
understand
that
situation.i
think
i'd
agree
with
that.
but
that's
the
decision
of
the
court.
my
question
is,
my
difficulty
is
that
this
is
a
different
situation.
if
you
don't
apply
the
consideration
rather
than
to
labor
generally
to
the
construction
of
the
statute
of
labor
specially.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
much
light
have
we
got?
how
much
--
i
looked
at
your
briefs,
how
much
light
to
be
shared
on
the
--
not
legal
purpose
but
the
actual
practicality
by
which
secession
membership
becomes
a
new
union.
the
whole
history
of
schismatic
(inaudible)
in
trade
union
movement,
a
good
deal
of
a
break
away
from
an
established
union
and
some
(inaudible)
gradually
some
of
the
new
union
from
establishing
itself,
the
court
could
get
some
hearings
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
rather
because
the
law
comes
in
and
helps
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
a
--
is
it
outside
of
the
scope
of
congress
to
handicap
secession
movements
as
much
as
possible?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
undoubtedly
a
power
of
congress,
entering
dangerous
ceremony
to
say
the
matter
of
policy.
we
want
to
stabilize
the
industry
and
(inaudible)
the
people
are
in
or
to
stay
in
unless
there
is
a
real
internal
revolution.
does
that
have
to
be
in
the
way
of
congress?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
the
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
yes,
but
the
whole
question
is
who
is
--
whether
a
court
should
settle
these
wrangles
and
whether
they
should
work
on
it
and
be
worked
out
so
they're
paying
full
in
arduous
internal
fight
of
the
union?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
could
that
be
anywhere
(inaudible)
divisional
review
and
to
still
have
it.
it's
all
been
exceptionally
specific?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
whole
--
the
whole
tendency
of
this
court,
in
my
mind
correct
(inaudible)
to
get
the
nature
of
the
industries,
people
in
(inaudible)
out
as
much
as
possible?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it's
very,
very
difficult
to
get
in
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
there
are
only
demonstrated
abuse
of
power
by
those
who
are
going
to
be
speaking,
trustees
of
other
people
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
spindelman,
i
think
(inaudible)
but
i
hope
you
leave
your
colleague
enough
time
to
deal
with
the
question
i
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that's
for
me
crucial
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
an
allegation
that
the
nature
--
the
nature
of
the
structure
of
this
arrangement
makes
it
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
that
it's
inherent
in
the
situation
and
not
directed
to
this
particular
situation.
is
that
a
fair
statement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
bias
because
he
represents
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
grueling
competitive
union?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
you're
--
this
is
where
my
trouble
comes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
your
allegation,
can
you
ask
anything
to
what
you've
answered
a
minute
ago
the
situation
makes
them
inescapably
biased?
what
--
what
evidence
--
what
--
what
do
you
want
to
prove?
the
documents
which
nobody
denied
to
make
up
on
the
board
which
nobody
denies?
the
representation
which
nobody
denies?
what
do
you
want
to
prove
at
the
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
fix,
that
isn't
your
allegation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
yes
but
conspiracy
to
keep
them
all.
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
charge
them,
yeah.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
--
if
they
may
rule
as
judges,
if
they
may
rule
as
judges
that
they
should
be
discharged,
then
you
have
the
right
to
compel
it
and
you'll
see
them
and
a
right
to
say
they
should
be
discharged
because
in
uroc,
either
biased.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
to
that
i
suggest
that
when
it
comes
a
time
on
that
allegation,
all
you
would
do
is
--
there's
not
enough
proof
to
be
put
in
beyond
the
facts
which
are
not
in
dispute
of
which
judicial
notice
is
in
place?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
to
what
a
complaint
charges
or
those
that
are
indicated
but
there's
some
limits
to
that,
aren't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
you've
said
up
--
what
you
said
now
is
what
the
case
is
to
me,
maybe
that's
a
setup
as
you
spoke
of
a
minute
ago,
a
setup
inherently
determined
biased.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that,
i
don't
see
what
proof
--
but
what
goes
to
prove
that
except
the
setup
that
is
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
announced
--
what
you
announced
departs
from
the
basis
of
judge
hand's
opinion
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
that
the
issue
to
be
observed.
i'm
not
saying
you
shouldn't.
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
--
what
i'm
saying
--
suggesting
is
that
the
basis
of
his
decision
is
different
from
what
you
are
now
putting
before
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
for
the
question
raised
by
justice
brennan
where
the
minority
view
relates
to
the
very
structure,
relates
to
the
being
--
to
the
being
of
the
union,
you've
got
a
different
minority
represent
interest
and
where
a
member
as
a
minority
of
--
just
because
of
color,
or
of
claim,
many
member
of
a
union
makes
the
claim
which
is
destructive
for
the
well
--
to
the
welfare
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
the
whole
union.
and
therefore
his
representatives
can
say,
“what
you're
claiming
for
yourself
is
hostile
to
our
interest
and
(inaudible)
i
just
want
to
say
that
--
that
qualification.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
--
the
bargaining
agents,
in
this
view,
the
brotherhood
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
constituted
as
it
is,
the
members
being
delegates
of
the
--
that's
not
an
unfair
description
of
the
union.
they
may
have
to
seek
in
judgment
in
a
controversy
that
involves
a
conflict
between
the
individual's
interests,
the
individual
member's
interest,
and
the
organization
as
an
organization.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
the
suggestion
is,
that
when
you
hear,
the
--
isn't
the
--
once
you
oust
the
union
from
the
right
to
speak
for
them,
you
got
a
different
situation.
there
is
hostility
not
as
to
the
individual
but
as
to
the
whole
capacity
of
the
delegate
who
is
speaking.
justice
felix
frankfurter
