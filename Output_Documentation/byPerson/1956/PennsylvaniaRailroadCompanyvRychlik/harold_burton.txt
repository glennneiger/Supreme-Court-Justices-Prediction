justice
harold
burton
by
joining
the
switchmen's
union,
does
that
put
him
under
the
protection
of
the
union-shop?
justice
harold
burton
so,
that
didn't
help
his
status?
justice
harold
burton
so
that,
he
is
in
the
same
position
that
he
was
in
the
first
place.
i
mean,
he
resigned
from
the
trainmen
and
then
he
joined
the
uroc
and
that's
where
he
stands.
justice
harold
burton
had
uroc
ever
try
to
avail
itself
of
that
procedure?
justice
harold
burton
is
--
justice
harold
burton
is
it
clear
in
your
mind
that
under
that
procedure,
under
section
(f),
that
uroc
couldn't
start
one
of
those
proceedings
whenever
it
wanted
to?
there
didn't
have
to
be
a
dispute
or
something
preceding
it
in
order
to
enable
it
to
raise
the
question?
it
could
just
make
an
application
that
it
wants
to
be
qualified
as
an
elector?
justice
harold
burton
would
there
have
--
justice
harold
burton
--
to
be
an
occasion
--
justice
harold
burton
--
would
there
have
to
be
an
election
coming
up
or
suppose
they
wanted
to
establish
their
status?
justice
harold
burton
but
if
uroc
wanted
to
establish
its
status
as
an
elector,
it
couldn't
start
a
proceeding
under
it
if
wanted
to.
justice
harold
burton
but
they
hadn't,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
harold
burton
i
see.
justice
harold
burton
that
would
leave
it
to
prove,
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
law,
regardless
of
anybody
else,
holding
it
to
be
that
way
with
no
--
justice
harold
burton
--
administrative
intervention.
