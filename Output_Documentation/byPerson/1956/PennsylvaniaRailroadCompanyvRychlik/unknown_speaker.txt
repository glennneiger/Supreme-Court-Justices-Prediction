which
case
was
that
that
you
spoke
of
just
now
that
had

unknown
speaker
no.
that's
all
right.
i
just
want
to
know
what
the
--
unknown
speaker
what
the
--
unknown
speaker
well,
how
--
how
was
it
using
it,
as
a
member
of
the
board?
unknown
speaker
was
the
point
up
in
that
case?
unknown
speaker
would
the
board
that
wants
to
be
a
“national
in
scope”,
would
it
have
any
other
way
do
you
say
to
determine
itself
whether
it
could
be
–-
unknown
speaker
--
in
this
scope?
unknown
speaker
i
–
i
understand
that
you
said
that
so
far
as
the
members
are
concern
that
that
isn't
decisive
with
him
because
he
–
he
can't
make
the
union
become
“national
in
scope”?
unknown
speaker
but
you
say
the
union
itself
can
in
some
other
way
become
“national
in
scope”?
be
determined?
unknown
speaker
could
it
be
determined
to
be
an
elector?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
language
of
the
agreement
itself,
the
union
agreement?
does
that
give
any
indication
of
what
is
an
isolate?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
to
that
young

unknown

employees
come
to
the
rules
and
working
conditions
organized
in
accordance
with
the
railway
labor
act.
unknown
speaker
and
it's
--
so
it
comes
separate
to
the
phrase
'“national
in
scope”?'
unknown
speaker
can
an
--
can
an
employee
have
duplicate
membership?
unknown
speaker
what
--
what
kind
of
an
expense
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
--
do
we
have
to
decide
here
what
--
what
is
a
national
union?
unknown
speaker
“national
in
scope”?
unknown
speaker
and
you
--
and
you
say
that
is
not
enough
for
you
to
go
on
or
--
for
your
union
to
follow
that
your
individual
(voice
overlap)
--
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
is
that
the
railroad's
words?
unknown
speaker
it
obviously
would
be
easier
to
you
in
this
one
case
but
as
the
policy
is
the
law
as
to
whether
it's
to
follow
the
--
what
is
it
--
first
--
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
assuming
again
and
3
first
(f)
is
the
only
way
i
which
you
can
be
“national
in
scope”
which
we
completely
deny
in
which
the
--
i
think
the
act
completely
denies.
unknown
speaker
no.
i'm
--
i'm
looking
at
it
from
a
standpoint
of
what
would
be
the
normal
desire
and
intent
of
congress
of
what
would
be
the
purpose
going
forward
and
you
have
no
legislative
history
because
there
wasn't
much
legislative
history
on
this
whole
light?
