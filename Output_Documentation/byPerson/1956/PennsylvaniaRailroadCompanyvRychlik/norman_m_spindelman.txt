mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
the
lower
court
said
in
substance
in
this
case,
nothing
would
more
completely
defeat
the
most
elementary
requirements
of
fair
play
and
nothing
with
more
firmly
entrenched
the
recognized
union
in
power
than
a
holding
that
judicial
review
was
not
necessary
from
the
decision
of
the
system
board
in
this
case.
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
application
of
section
3,
first
(f)
and
the
entrenchment
of
the
unions
in
power,
and
mr.
fix
will
discuss
the
elementary
requirements
of
fair
play.
we've
broken
up
our
argument
in
that
way
in
order
to
better
tie
it
in
with
the
opposition
argument
which
was
presented
in
that
manner.
now,
the
technical
provisions
of
section
3,
first
(f)
dealing
with
labor
union
eligibility
to
participate
in
the
selection
of
labor
members
to
the
adjustment
board
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
employee's
statutory
right
to
hold
his
job
if
he
belongs
to
a
union
which
is
national
in
scope.
now,
under
any
construction
of
the
statute,
eligibility
for
a
seat
on
the
board
cannot
be
a
possibly
--
cannot
possibly
be
an
adequate
remedy
to
the
employee
for
bias
on
the
system
board
level
because
section
3,
first
(f)
is
not
applicable
to
him.
he
can't
get
a
seat
on
the
board
and
he
has
no
way
of
compelling
his
union
to
get
a
seat
on
the
board,
and
i
might
point
out
that
that
was
the
only
argument
that
was
made
in
the
lower
court
in
this
case.
the
second
argument
of
exclusiveness
was
certain
--
certainly
not
firmly
pressed,
if
pressed
at
all,
in
the
lower
court.
now,
because
of
the
lower
court
holding,
the
petitioner's
now
argue
that
national
in
scope
exception
to
the
union-shop
requirement
which
congress
cast
in
terms
of
employee
rights
really
confers
a
right
not
on
the
employee,
but
on
his
labor
organization
to
exempt
him
from
the
union-shop
requirement
not
if
that
union
is
national
in
scope,
no,
but
if
it
is
qualified
to
participate
in
the
selection
of
adjustment
board
members.
and,
they
further
argue
that
a
seat
on
the
board
is
the
only
way,
the
exclusive
way,
that
national
in
scope
status
could
be
achieved
and
this
argument
is
also
very
necessary
because
if
there's
any
discretion
left
in
the
system
board,
we're,
again,
presented
with
a
question
of
the
bias
in
the
system
board.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
no,
i
do
not
suggest
that
national
in
scope
for
being
an
elector
is
different
from
any
other
national
in
scope,
but
i
do
say
that
the
three-man
board
does
not
determine
only
national
in
scope.
now,
to
accomplish
the
results
which
the
petitioners
are
asking
for
here,
the
statute
has
to
be
drastically
rewritten
in
its
language.
petitioners
aren't
asking
for
statutory
construction
here.
they
are
asking
for
a
judicial
legislation
and
there
are
many
instances.
apparently,
over
20
words
in
the
statute
would
have
to
be
achieved
to
get
to
their
construction.
now,
petitioner's
argument
that
the
rights
which
congress,
in
expressed
terms
--
and
this
is
one
of
the
changes
which
congress,
in
expressed
terms,
conferred
on
the
employee
in
section
2
of
the
railway
labor
act,
congress
said
"an
employee
can
hold
his
job
if
he
holds
membership
in
a
national
in
scope
organization,”
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
--
were,
in
reality,
given
to
his
union.
this
is
not
a
new
argument.
it
was
argued
to
this
court
in
the
elgin
case
that,
despite
expressed
language
to
the
contrary,
the
statute
did
not
give
the
employee
a
right
to
process
his
own
grievances
but,
instead,
gave
this
right
to
his
union.
now,
this
court
specifically
rejected
this
argument
in
the
elgin
case.
now,
certainly,
the
employee's
right
to
have
a
fair
determination
made
on
whether
or
not
he
is
entitled
to
hold
his
job,
which
is
the
basic
question
here,
is
as
basic
as
his
right
to
process
his
own
grievances,
which
this
court
said
he
had
in
the
elgin
case.
now,
in
the
elgin
case,
this
court
went
so
far
as
to
specifically
reject
the
past
practices
of
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
in
reaching
its
conclusion.
in
that
case,
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
has
specifically
held
in
the
past
that
the
employee
did
not
have
an
individual
right
to
adjust
his
own
grievances.
now,
here,
the
court
does
not
have
to
do
this.
past
precedent
confirms
that
the
right
to
determine
national
in
scope
status
of
his
union
is
in
the
employee
and
that
the
labor
unions
qualifying
for
a
seat
on
the
board
is
not
the
exclusive
manner
in
which
national
in
scope
status
can
be
obtained.
now,
all
of
the
past
decisions
dealing
with
uroc
and
its
members,
with
the
exception
of
one
case.
the
district
court
case
--
district
court
opinion
in
the
pigott
case,
including
the
majority
and
minority
opinion
in
the
pigott
case
in
the
court
of
appeals,
all,
at
least
tacitly,
assumed
that
this
right
given
by
the
statute
is
in
the
employee.
there
is
no
case
cited
to
the
contrary,
with
the
exception
of
the
district
court
opinion
in
the
pigott
case.
therefore,
at
least
in
line
with
court
authority,
there
is
no
precedent
especially
in
view
of
the
elgin
case,
a
decision
of
the
court,
for
a
holding
that
the
individual
rights
are
not
in
the
employee.
now,
the
government,
in
its
brief,
in
the
amici
curiae
brief
of
the
government,
makes
a
very
interesting
--
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
certainly.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
no.
that
--
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
no,
i
would
not,
your
honor,
for
several
reasons.first
of
all,
you
would
not
only
have
to
disagree
with
me
on
the
fact
that
the
right
is
in
the
employee.
you
would
further
have
to
disagree
with
me
that
this
is
an
exclusive
right
in
the
labor
organization.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
and,
further
than
that,
you
would
have
to
disagree
with
me
on
the
fact
that
this
is
the
exclusive
manner
--
section
3,
first
(f),
getting
a
seat
on
the
board
is
the
exclusive
manner
in
which
that
can
be
determined.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
you
have
to
disagree
on
all
those
issues.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
then,
i'd
still
--
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
no,
it
still
would
not
end
my
case.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
because,
even
assuming
that
all
of
those
things
were
so,
i
say
that
section
3,
fist
(f),
under
any
interpretation,
can't
be
an
adequate
remedy
because,
before
you
can
get
to
section
3,
first
(f),
before
you
can
get
to
the
secretary
of
labor,
you
have
to
go
to
your
competitors
for
all
practical
purposes.
you
have
to
go
to
the
participating
organizations.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
the
secretary
of
labor
said
so.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
let
me
point
the
two
past
decisions
of
the
secretary
of
labor.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
yes.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
yes.
that
is
definitely
my
view.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
that
is
true.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
and,
i
think
that
--
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
--
past
practice
backs
me
up
on
that.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
i
think
that
the
past
practice
backs
me
up
on
that.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
now,
i
was
getting
to
the
point
that
the
government
had
made,
in
its
amici
curiae
brief,
the
government
--
and
this
is
the
only
--
the
only
argument
that
is
made
in
terms
of
statutory
construction
as
far
as
its
right
in
the
employee,
the
government,
in
its
brief,
points
to
the
expanded
language
in
the
union-shop
amendment
as
justifying
the
interpretation
that
congress
intended
to
vest
the
right
in
the
labor
union.
now,
the
obvious
answer
to
this
is,
why,
instead
of
using
the
expanded
language,
didn't
congress
save
themselves
about
15
words
and
say
that
the
employee
can
maintain
his
job,
can
hold
his
job
if
he
belongs
to
an
organization
which
is
qualified
under
section
3,
first
(h)?
it's
a
much
simpler
way
of
putting
it.
now,
even
disregarding
this,
aside
from
this,
the
expanded
language
has
a
much
simpler
explanation.
now,
the
expanded
language
which
the
government
refers
to
and,
by
expanded
language,
i
mean
that
they
must
be
national
in
scope,
organized
in
accordance
with
the
act,
and
fairly
represent
the
members
of
a
craft
or
class,
or
--
i
don't
mean
that
word
“fairly,”
i
meant
represent
members
of
a
craft
or
class.
this
language
is
identical
in
its
terms
to
section
3,
first
(a),
not
section
3,
first
(f)
of
the
act.
now,
there
was
an
administrative
determination,
two
of
them,
two
administrative
determinations
made
of
the
meaning
of
section
3,
first
(a),
and
these
determinations
were
made
by
the
secretary
of
labor
who,
incidentally,
they
were
made
under
a
section
3,
first
(f)
proceeding
but
they
were
made
as
interpretations
of
section
3,
first
(a).
and,
in
these
determinations,
the
secretary
set
forth
a
definition
of
the
phrase
“national
in
scope”
and
this
is
his
definition
in
substance.
he
says
that,
“to
be
national
in
scope,
a
union
must
represent
employees
of
different
companies
rather
than
be
organized
within
a
single
company
or
carrier
and
have
more
or
less
of
a
general
dissemination
throughout
the
country
and,”
he
didn't
use
that
exact
language
but
he
used
these
criteria
to
show
that,
“geographical
area
of
representation,
number
of
employees
represented,
number
of
agreements,
number
of
carriers
with
whom
agreements
are
held,
and
the
mileage
of
such
carriers.”
now,
we
say
that
the
expanded
language
of
--
that
congress
used
in
the
union-shop
amendment,
section
2,
eleventh
(c),
they
use
that
language
to
incorporate
the
previous
definition
of
the
secretary
of
labor
and,
instead
of
using
that
definition,
they
could
use
very
few
words
to
accomplish
that
purpose.
now,
that
becomes
very
significant
in
view
of
the
argument
that
chaos
and
confusion
and
uncertainty
will
result
if
judicial
review
is
put
into
this
case.
the
emphasis
on
this
--
in
this
case
is
not
on
the
legal,
the
morale,
or
the
statutory
justification
for
importing
wholesale
the
provisions
of
section
3,
first
(f)
and
section
3,
first
(a)
into
this
union-shop
amendment
and
changing
the
language
of
the
union-shop
amendment.
the
emphasis
is
not
--
are
none
of
those.
the
emphasis
here
and
the
starting
point
of
counsel's
argument
before
this
court
was
chaos
and
confusion
and
uncertainty
will
result
if
this
isn't
done.
therefore,
you
must
do
it,
in
effect.
now,
remembering
the
secretary
of
labor's
definition
in
light
of
this
argument,
as
i
say
--
said
before,
the
secretary
of
labor's
definition
becomes
very
important
for,
under
the
secretary
of
labor's
definition,
we'd
have
a
definite
guide
to
everyone
as
to
what
national
in
scope
means.
under
the
opposite
construction,
if
section
3,
first
(f)
is
deemed
to
be
an
exclusive
remedy,
we
have
certainty,
as
far
as
the
recognized
organization
goes,
the
certainty
of
being
entrenched,
there'll
never
be
a
challenge
by
any
new
organization
successfully,
number
one.
you
have
certainty
as
to
them,
but
you
have
no
certainty,
for
example,
as
to
the
employee
or
as
to
the
new
union.
now,
the
employee
cannot
make
any
independent
determination
of
his
own
as
to
whether
he
can
join
a
competing
union
because
he
doesn't
know
whether
it's
national
in
scope
or
not.
there's
no
definition
at
all
advanced
under
their
theory.
the
definition
is
that
it's
going
to
be
given
some
time
in
the
future
by
a
three-man
board
which,
since
1934,
has
never
been
convened
and
which
may
never
be
convened
in
the
future.
so,
in
other
words,
no
one
knows
what
it
means.
this
three-man
board
has
never
met.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
yes,
sir.
our
appendix
in
this
case
shows
that.
we
went
as
far
as
the
first
step
and
the
point
that
we
are
now
at,
as
the
participating
organizations
have
told
us,
that,
sometime
in
the
indefinite
future,
they
will
give
us
a
hearing.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
we
went,
first,
to
the
secretary
of
labor
and
we
said
to
him,
“in
view
of
all
the
court
decisions
on
this
matter,
we
think
that
ought
to
show
a
dispute.”
the
secretary
of
labor
said,
“i'm
sorry,
that's
a
different
question.
you
have
to
go
to
these
participating
organizations
to
get
a
dispute
certified.”
so,
we
went
to
the
participating
organizations.
that
was
quite
a
while
ago.
now,
we
are
finally
at
the
point
where
we
have
a
--
a
date
set
for
some
indefinite
time
of
the
future
on
which
we
will
be
heard.
i
might
point
out
that
the
same
thing
happened
to
the
american
railway
supervisors
association.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
well,
we
have
an
indefinite
date.
the
last
letter
that
we
have
received
is
--
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
no,
we
don't
have.
that's
the
whole
point.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
we
--
we
have
no
date
whatsoever.
they
just
tell
us
“sometime
in
the
indefinite
future,
we'll
have
a
hearing.”
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
the
participating
organizations.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
he
told
us
to
go
to
them
first,
that's
right.
apparently,
what
is
indicated
--
as
the
secretary
has
indicated
in
his
past
two
decisions,
and
in
the
matter
of
the
sleeping
car
porters
--
brotherhood
of
sleeping
car
porters,
and
in
the
matter
of
the
railway
supervisors
association
inc.,
in
both
those
cases,
the
secretary
of
labor
finally
stepped
in.
and,
he
stepped
in
on
the
theory,
and
i'd
like
to
quote
his
language
on
that
because
i
think
i
feel
it's
very
significant,
“that
the
participating
organization
seemed
to
have
carefully
avoided
taking
any
position
on
this
matter.”
so,
in
other
words,
once
it
becomes
evident
enough
to
everyone
that
the
participating
organizations,
because
of
self-interest,
will
do
nothing,
then,
the
secretary
of
labor
could
step
in.
but,
of
course,
we
have
no
guarantee
that
he
will
ever
step
in,
and
the
suggestion
advanced
by
counsel
that
this
court,
in
some
future
case,
might
be
able
to
compel
him
to
step
in,
i
think
that's
a
very
farfetched
legal
argument
in
some
respects
because
what
it
would
mean
would
be
that
this
court
would
be
substituting
its
discretion
for
the
discretion
of
the
secretary
of
labor
where
congress
has
specifically
said
it's
the
secretary
of
labor's
job
to
do
this.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
that's
what
i
mean
exactly.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
the
appendix
shows
that
--
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
i
think,
approximately,
about
two
years
ago.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
no,
sir,
we
have
not.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
well,
it
was
started
in
july
of
1954.
we,
then,
went
--
after
much
go
around
as
to
who
we
were
supposed
to
apply
to
and
as
to
whether
they
were
really
the
right
person
to
apply
to,
we
then
went
back
to
the
secretary
of
labor
and
told
him
that
--
asked
him
some
further
questions
and
try
to
get
a
dispute
certified
from
the
secretary
of
labor
to
the
second
point,
to
amend
my
previous
answer,
to
the
second
point
because
of
the
previous
court
decisions.
by
that
time,
there
were
five
or
six
court
decisions
where
this
point
had
been
contested,
and
he
said,
“no,
that's
a
completely
different
question.
that
question
deals
with
the
union-shop
amendment.
that
doesn't
deal
with
section
3,
first
(f).
you
still
have
to
go
to
the
participating
organizations.”
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
since
that
point,
the
last
letter
that
we
received
was
in
1955,
sometime
in
1955.
i
believe,
september
30
of
1955.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
that
was
a
letter
from
a
mr.
a.e.
lyon
who
is
the
secretary
of
the
railway
labor
executives
association,
in
which
he
set
this
date
for
some
time
in
the
indefinite
future.
no
date,
as
your
honor
said
previously.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
not
since
that
point,
no,
sir.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
waiting
for
this
case
your
honor.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
this
litigation?
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
it
started
in
january
of
1955,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
i
think
that's
very
true
generally.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
i
--
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
thank
you.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
thank
you
sir.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset
of
my
argument
today,
i
would
like
to
clarify
a
question
asked
yesterday.
the
question
was
put
concerning
appendix
f
to
respondent's
brief
which
is
correspondence
dealing
with
uroc's
attempt
to
get
a
seat
on
the
board.
now
this
appendix
was
inserted
only
for
one
reason
and
that
was
to
show
how
complete
the
control
of
the
qualified
organizations
is
if
qualifying
for
a
seat
on
the
board
is
the
exclusively
way
in
which
“national
in
scope”
status
can
be
obtained.
now,
rychlik
not
uroc
is
the
respondent
in
this
case.
and
whatever
action
was
taken
by
uroc
to
get
a
seat
on
the
board
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
rychlik's
right
to
hold
his
job
if
he
belongs
to
a
“national
in
scope”
union.
now
just
because
coincidentally
a
union
must
be
among
other
things
“national
in
scope”
to
get
a
seat
on
the
board
does
not
mean
that
qualifying
for
such
a
seat
is
the
exclusive
way
that
“national
in
scope”
status
can
be
obtained.
that
it
is
not
the
exclusively
way
is
convincingly
demonstrated
by
past
authority
and
by
reading
of
the
act.
in
1939,
the
railroad
retirement
board
published
regulations
which
concerned
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
“national
in
scope”
as
it
was
used
in
the
railroad
retirement
act.
those
regulations
are
very
specific
that
section
3,
first
(f)
qualifying
for
a
seat
on
the
board
is
not
the
exclusive
way
in
which
“national
in
scope”
status
can
be
obtained.
now
in
addition,
expert
authority
also
agrees
with
this
contention.
there
was
a
special
board
of
adjustment
convened
to
decide
whether
the
railroad
industrial
union
which
is
a
union
organized
in
the
state
of
maryland
was
a
“national
in
scope”
organization.
now
this
special
board
of
adjustment
on
which
experts
said
decided
that
this
union
was
not
a
“national
in
scope”
union.
but
in
coming
to
that
determination,
this
board
examined
that
many,
many
other
criteria
besides
the
fact
that
this
union
had
not
qualified
for
a
seat
on
the
board.
they
made
a
very
exhaustive
determination
of
their
size,
their
stationary,
whether
their
officers
were
full
or
part
time,
how
many
organizers
they
had
in
the
field,
how
many
locals
they
had
organized,
and
many,
many
other
factors.
now
in
addition,
court
authority
also
confirms
that
this
--
that
getting
a
seat
on
the
board
is
not
the
exclusive
way
in
which
“national
in
scope”
status
can
be
obtained.
for
example,
this
court
as
a
manner
of
fact
assumed
in
order
of
railway
conductors
versus
swan,
that
the
railroad
yardmasters
of
america
was
a
national
labor
organization
despite
the
fact
that
that
organization
at
that
time
did
not
have
any
members
on
the
adjustment
board.
now
in
addition,
a
reading
of
the
act
makes
very
clear
that
the
terms
of
the
statutes
must
be
changed.
the
wording
of
the
statute
must
be
changed
to
a
great
extent
if
this
interpretation
is
to
apply.
now,
i
refer
the
court
--
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
order
of
railway
conductors
versus
swan.the
court
in
its
statement
of
the
facts
stated
that
the
railroad
yardmasters
of
america
was
a
“national
in
scope”
or
was
a
national
labor
organization
despite
the
fact
that
it
had
no
seat
on
the
board.
that
was
specifically
mentioned
in
the
facts.
i
can
read
that
quote
if
--
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
the
329
u.s.520.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
no.
well,
the
question
in
that
--
in
that
case
was
a
question
which
is
not
at
all
involved
in
this
case.
they're
not
similar.
but
in
the
statement
of
facts,
mr.
justice
murphy
speaking
for
the
court
stated
that
the
contention
that
was
presented
by
the
other
side
is
contradicted
by
the
railroad
yardmasters
of
america,
a
national
labor
organization
and
that
organization
has
failed
to
place
a
representative
on
any
one
of
the
four
divisions.
in
other
words,
it
had
no
representatives
on
the
board
but
you
still
refer
to
it
as
a
national
labor
organization
under
the
terms
of
the
railway
labor
act
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
no.
the
question
was
not
up
in
the
case.
the
seventh
circuit
specifically
stated
that
section
3,
first
(f)
getting
a
seat
on
the
board
was
not
the
exclusive
way
in
which
“national
in
scope”
status
could
be
obtained.
and
they
stated
that
in
uroc
versus
pennsylvania
railroad.
that
was
a
specific
statement
by
the
court
that
came
to
that
conclusion.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
that
is
correct.
now
as
i
said
before
--
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
that
i
agree
but
the
other
side
of
the
coin
doesn't
necessarily
hold.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
among
--
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
among
other
things,
it
must
be
“national
in
scope”
but
because
that
is
so,
does
not
mean
that
to
be
“national
in
scope”
it
must
qualify
to
take
that
coin
and
reverse
it.
now
the
emphasis
of
the
petitioner
is
not
on
the
legal
or
moral
justification
of
making
these
wholesale
of
changes
in
the
statute
to
reach
this
interpretation.
the
emphasis
instead
is
on
chaos,
confusion
and
uncertainty.
as
a
matter
of
fact
mr.
kaiser
used
practically
those
words
to
start
his
argument.
now
--
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
yes.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
yes.
i
say
that
this
organization
could
--
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
that's
right.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
of
course
--
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
no.
it
could
not
be
determined
to
be
an
elector
in
any
other
manner.
i
think
the
statute
is
exclusive
on
that
point.
but
i
do
believe
that
the
national
--
that
the
union,
all
of
the
question
is
not
presented
by
this
case
because
the
employee
is
involved
rather
than
union.
i
do
believe
that
the
union
also
could
qualify,
could
become
“national
in
scope”
rather
in
another
manner.
in
other
words,
by
suppose
for
example
that
the
union
brought
a
declaratory
judgment
action,
i
think
in
that
case.
and
of
course
that's
not
an
issue
here,
i
realized.
but
i
think
in
that
case,
by
applying
the
secretary
of
labor's
definition,
the
court
might
proceed.
and
whether
they
would
have
jurisdiction
in
that
particular
case
or
not,
i
do
not
know.
i
mean,
i'm
not
reaching
any
--
any
point
on
that.
now
as
i
just
said,
the
emphasis
of
the
petitioner
is
on
this
chaos,
confusion
and
uncertainty
in
the
field.
at
the
outset,
i
think
the
court
should
recognize
that
whatever
chaos
and
confusion
and
uncertainty
comes
into
the
field
because
of
judicial
review
is
caused
by
the
actions
of
the
petitioners
themselves.
in
other
words,
had
the
petitioners
set
up
a
truly
impartial
board
to
hear
this
union
shout
disputes,
this
case
would
not
be
before
this
court
now.
so,
it
is
their
own
action
in
attempting
to
entrench
themselves
firmly
and
finely
that
causes
judicial
review
and
causes
the
very
chaos
and
confusion
if
there
is
any
chaos
and
confusion
which
they
are
complaining
about.
now
further,
we
think
that
there
will
be
no
chaos
and
confusion.
yesterday,
i
explained
to
the
court,
i
hoped,
that
the
secretary
of
labor's
definition
was
what
congress
intended
to
incorporate
in
the
expanded
language
which
it
used.
now,
by
use
of
the
secretary
of
labor's
definition
which
he
made
in
two
cases
before
the
union
shop
amendment
was
passed
and
then
consolidated
in
the
third
case
which
was
after
the
union
shop
amendment
was
passed.
in
other
words,
he
put
it
in
formal
terms
of
a
definition
in
the
third
case
but
he
had
mentioned
the
same
factors
in
the
previous
two.
in
terms
of
this
definition,
we
have
certainty
for
everyone
in
the
field.
we
have
here
a
definite
guide
which
the
employee
can
examine
and
he
can
tell
just
exactly
where
he
stands
if
he
wishes
to
join
another
union.
he
can
tell
exactly
how
long
he
must
double
head
in
order
to
achieve
his
job
if
he
wants
to
join
another
union
by
finding
out
what
the
plans
of
this
union
are
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
he
doesn't
have
to
double
head
for
an
indefinite
period
of
time
until
a
three-man
board
convenes
which
has
never
convened
to
decide
what
“national
in
scope”
means.
that's
a
number
--
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
no.
that's
of
course
always
possible.
but
in
light
of
the
secretary's
definition
--
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
well,
i
think
it's
controlling
--
if
this
court
for
example
were
to
say
that
congress
intended
to
incorporate
the
secretary's
definition,
of
course
that
would
be
controlling
upon
the
lower
court.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
i
am
arguing
that
congress
did
so
intend.
that
is
not
necessary
actually
for
the
determination
of
the
basic
issue
involved
here
but
i'm
saying
it
would
clarify
the
issue
because
i
think
congress
actually
did
intend
that
as
it
is
shown
by
their
expanded
language.
with
this
definition,
spurious
litigation
by
small
unions
would
be
discouraged
because
of
the
fact
that
they
know
that
they
could
not
qualify.
and
even
without
the
definition,
spurious
litigation
i
think
would
be
discouraged
because
the
term
means
according
to
the
secretary
of
labor,
the
term
is
not
used
as
a
term
of
art,
its
term
--
it's
used
in
it's
generally,
commonly,
accepted
meaning.
and
as
this
court
held
--
has
held
in
the
past,
the
term
national
labor
--
or
national
or
international
labor
organization
was
used
in
the
taft-hartley
act
and
it's
commonly
accepted
sense
and
not
in
its
technical
meaning
that
was
applied
before
a
decision
on
national
labor
relations
board
versus
highland
park
manufacturing
company.
and
in
addition
to
that,
the
minority
opinion
was
based
up
on
the
fact
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
had
held
that
it
was
a
term
of
art.
and
therefore,
this
court
should
not
change
that
determination.
in
our
field
therefore,
both
majority
and
minority
would
agree
that
it
was
a
generally
accepted
meaning
which
controls
because
here,
the
secretary
of
labor
who
was
the
administrative
official-in-charge
with
this
section
of
the
act
has
specifically
held
that
this
is
not
a
term
of
art
but
is
used
in
its
generally
accepted
meaning,
in
other
words
under
both
majority
and
minority
of
the
highland
park
decision.
it's
that
meaning
which
is
the
meaning
used
in
the
act.
so
therefore,
to
answer
your
question
mr.
justice
brennan,
even
if
we
do
not
incorporate
the
secretary
of
labor's
definition
into
the
act,
we
still
have
the
generally
accepted
meaning
which
would
guide
the
courts.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
yes,
definitely.
that
was
one
of
the
part
--
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
i
think
again,
a
comparison
would
definitely
be
drawn
to
these
other
fields
and
--
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
no.
i
mean
commonly
understood
in
any
field.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
what
would
the
laymen
think
was
“national
in
scope”
under
these
circumstances?
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
i
don't
know
anything
about
it.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
you
mean
as
one
system?
of
course
you
have
a
very
particularized
situation
in
the
telephone
industry
because
most
of
your
systems
do
belong
to
the
bell
corporation
which
is
spread
in
several
states.
of
course
that
might
be
a
point
of
confusion
for
example
as
to
the
pennsylvania
railroad
here
which
also
goes
in
to
several
states
and
is
a
very
large
system.
and
for
example
if
you
have
a
very
large
contract
on
the
pennsylvania
railroad
which
had
50,000
or
60,000
members
covered
by
that
contract
in
several
states,
i
suppose
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
argue
that
such
a
union
was
not
in
a
generally
accepted
sense.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
no.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
i
don't
think
so
not
if
you
go
back
to
what
the
term
actually
means.
i
admit
that
there
may
be
a
discrepancy
in
that
particular
limited
situation
but
generally,
i
think
“national
in
scope”
would
mean
organized
in
several
states.
it
would
mean
the
very
characteristics
which
the
secretary
of
labor
has
pointed
out.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
well,
of
several.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
yes.
that
is
one
of
the
criteria
which
the
secretary
has
brought
in.
i
think
the
reason
that
that
was
brought
in
actually
is
in
view
of
the
history
of
the
act.
i
think
the
term
“national
in
scope”
was
originally
used
to
distinguish
between
company
unions
which
at
that
time
were
very
prevalent
in
the
railway
labor
industry
and
the
organized
brotherhoods
which
had
to
do
something
that
feed
the
influence
of
these
company
unions
and
therefore
incorporated
this
term
and
incorporated
section
3,
first
(f)
into
the
act
for
that
reason
probably,
originally.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
i'm
sorry.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
no,
i
don't
think
so
because
if
you
want
to
distinguish
between
a
company
union,
the
word
“company
union”
is
not
limited
to
the
railway
labor
field.
it
has
a
generally
accepted
meaning
throughout
every
industry.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
no.
it
makes
no
further
definition
than
the
statutes
does.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
is
that
--
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
that
phrase
is
also
used
in
the
statute.
that
is
one
of
the
other
requirements
which
is
necessary
besides
“national
in
scope”
but
that
requirement
is
not
in
dispute
in
this
case.
uroc
has
participated
in
i
believe
approximately
28
elections
to
this
point.
and
each
of
those
elections,
the
national
mediation
board
has
certified
that
it
is
a
union
organized
in
accordance
with
the
act.
so
therefore,
that
question
is
not
an
issue
in
this
particular
case.
the
pennsylvania
concedes
that
in
its
brief.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
that
is
correct.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
the
fact
that
it
is
not
essential
as
the
petitioner's
contend
that
some
railroad
board
made
this
determination.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
definitely.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
it
determines
a
related
question.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
think
the
case
applies
also
on
the
basis
of
your
opinion
in
that
case,
you
said
in
that
case
--
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
agreed.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
but
i
still
think
the
fact
that
the
secretary
of
labor
who
was
the
administrative
official
entrusted
with
the
responsibility
of
administering
this
act
that
his
definition
of
the
phrase
and
that
he's
saying
that
the
phrase
is
using
this
generally
accepted
sense
has
bearing
upon
this
case.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
the
fact
that
--
and
this
court
--
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
well,
the
secretary
of
labor
has
said
it's
the
generally
accepted
meaning
that
applies.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
i
see.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
generally,
we
agree
that
this
specialized
legislation
but
not
on
this
particular
point
--
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
--
according
to
what
the
secretary
of
labor
has
said.
now,
it
is
true
that
the
present
posture
of
this
case,
court
must
make
a
determination
of
“national
in
scope”
status
under
the
lower
court's
opinion.
now
while
it
is
conceivable
that
diverse
opinions
maybe
reached,
the
courts
will
have
this
secretary
of
labor's
definition
as
a
certain
guide.
now
spurious
litigations
would
therefore
be
discouraged
by
small
unions.
and
on
the
other
hand,
the
qualified
organizations
would
not
arbitrarily
start
non-compliance
proceedings
against
the
members
of
the
competing
union
without
carefully
examining
its
status.
and
finally,
in
addition
while
under
the
imposing
--
opposing
construction
there
is
no
meaning.
the
definition
that
they
are
asking
for
is
in
reality
not
a
definition
at
all.
they
are
saying
it's
a
definition
to
be
made
by
some
three
men
board
in
some
future
proceeding
which
has
never
arisen
since
1934
which
may
arise
at
some
time
in
the
future.
in
addition,
we
say
that
this
ruling
would
give
full
meaning
to
all
of
the
language
used
in
the
end.
now
under
the
opposite
construction,
this
is
what
we
have.
application
must
be
made
to
somebody
to
have
a
dispute
certified.
now
assuming
that
somebody
does
certified
this
dispute,
all
of
this
takes
time.
they
can
set
it
for
an
indefinite
date
in
the
future
as
they
have
done
here
then
they
assume
that
a
meaning
is
held
and
nothing
is
done.
again,
more
delay,
more
delay,
delay
in
this
case
amounting
to
control.
finally,
under
this
construction,
under
the
opposite
construction,
how
can
a
new
union
grow
to
the
size
where
at
least
has
the
possibility
of
making
a
successful
application
to
this
three
men
board
when
one
of
the
supposed
chief
advantages
of
exclusive
determinations
under
3,
first
(f),
in
other
words
getting
a
seat
on
the
board
is
that
an
employee
will
not
jeopardize
his
job
by
belonging
to
an
unqualified
organization
where
the
employee
is
supposed
to
come
from.
if
everybody
is
waiting
for
you
to
be
qualified,
where
do
you
get
your
members?
now,
finally
--
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
yes.
he
could
double
head.
but
economically
in
light
of
the
delay
that
is
possible
here,
that's
a
very
--
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
to
double
head?
the
--
i
believe
the
average
membership
is
now
probably
about
$8
a
month.
he
can
double
head
in
the
uroc
for
probably
an
additional
$2.50
a
month.
but
mind
you,
there
is
no
limit
to
how
long
this
will
last
because
we
don't
know
how
long
it's
going
to
take
for
a
three-man
board
to
be
convened.
this
could
go
on
indefinitely.
so,
what
you're
doing
is
you're
asking
the
employee
to
double
head
for
an
indefinitely
length
of
time
with
no
assurance
of
success.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
no.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
no.
the
only
reason
that
this
--
this
question
is
before
the
court
at
this
point
is
the
contentions
made
by
the
opposition.
we
rest
simply
on
the
fact
that
there
is
judicial
review
required
because
of
the
absence
of
the
fair
play
requirements
which
are
essential
in
all
hearings
which
mr.
fix
will
discuss.
we
rest
simply
on
that
point.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
my
individual
thought,
yes,
through
this
procedure.
now
finally,
this
procedure
which
they
suggest
would
of
course
be
no
solution
for
rychlik
in
this
particular
case
because
rychlik,
even
if
the
three-man
board
will
hold
tomorrow
that
uroc
is
otherwise
properly
qualified
to
participate
in
the
selection
of
adjustment
board
members,
even
if
they
were
to
hold
this
tomorrow,
they
wouldn't
affect
rychlik's
position
in
the
least
iota.
he
would
still
be
discharged,
is
determinative
of
date,
is
the
date
on
which
he
was
cited.
so
in
other
words
if
uroc
would
be
held,
be
properly
qualified
to
participate
tomorrow,
that
wouldn't
help
rychlik
any
back
at
the
time
when
he
was
fired.
so
therefore,
as
far
as
the
individual
or
respondent
in
this
case,
it
certainly
no
adequate
remedy
for
him.
it
wouldn't
even
help
him
if
he
want
it.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
right.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
right.
but
we
--
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
that's
very
true
but
we
suffer
a
disadvantage.
i
shouldn't
say
we,
i
should
say
the
new
union
suffers
a
disadvantage
in
this
field.
it
isn't
true
in
any
other
field
for
in
this
field,
suppose
for
example
that
the
union
--
that
the
new
union
holds
the
contract.
they
won
it
by
several
votes
or
one
vote.
when
they
hold
a
contract,
all
of
the
people
who
voted
against
it
and
who
intended
to
stay
with
the
qualified
organization,
they
can
belong
to
the
qualified
organization.
they
don't
have
to
pay
any
dues
to
this
new
union
whatsoever.
now
on
the
next
vote
suppose
that
the
new
union
loses
by
one
vote,
all
of
its
members
must
immediately
double
head
in
the
other
organization
to
keep
their
jobs.
now,
that's
not
true
in
any
other
field
of
law
that
i
know
of
at
least
besides
the
operating
end
of
the
railway
labor
field.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
no.
it
does
not
--
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
no.
i
said
there
is
--
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
no.
i
said
there's
nothing
that
--
that
perhaps
could
stop
congress
from
doing
so
--
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
--
on
a
theoretical
question.
but
further,
i
point
out
the
fact
that
congress
has
specifically
indicated
its
intent
not
to
do
so
by
the
language
that
it
used
in
the
end.
it
provided
for
new
organizations
by
the
very
provisions
that
we're
discussing
here
--
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
--
section
3,
first
(f).
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
but
what
we're
saying
here
is
if
there
is
not
judicial
review
at
some
point
in
this
procedure.
you
have
complete
control
on
the
other
side,
you'll
never
have
a
new
organization.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
no.
and
either
judicial
--
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
and
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
i
agree
with
that
but
i
--
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
i
think
you've
exactly
described
this
case.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
that's
assuming
that
we
ever
could
get
and
that's'
assuming
that
the
union
we're
talking
about
that
the
union
could
ever
get
people
of
the
secretary
of
labor.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
it's
a
long
involved
procedure
as
far
as
the
union
is
concern.
in
this
case,
there
is
a
determination
by
the
system
board
which
we
alleged
was
bias
which
we
feel
there
must
be
a
judicial
review
for
it.
i
think
it
would
be
easier
to
prove
it
now
while
the
question
of
bias
is
there.
that's
remedy
one
--
one
question
at
a
time.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
3,
first
(f).
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
that's
very
true.
but
i
--
i
think
congress
has
certainly
shown
an
intent
not
to
incorporate
these
technical
provisions
as
far
as
the
employees'
rights
are
guaranteed.
we're
concerned
here
with
employees
rights
not
with
the
union
right
to
qualify
for
other
purposes
which
happens
to
be
in
the
act
on
coincidental
basis.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
i
was
just
going
to
leave.
mr.
norman
m.
spindelman
yes
sir.
thank
you.
