mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
suit
brought
by
a
railroad
employee
for
reinstatement
in
his
job
after
his
dismissal
under
the
terms
of
a
union-shop
agreement.
in
his
suit,
he
asked
an
opportunity
--
he
asked
that
the
railroad
and
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen,
petitioners
here,
to
be
restrained
from
continuing
his
discharge
until
he'd
had
an
opportunity
for
readmission
to
membership
in
the
brotherhood
and
further
ask
that
enforcement
of
the
union-shop
agreement
against
him
be
restrained.
the
suit
was
brought
in
the
district
court
for
the
western
districts
of
new
york
which
dismissed
the
complaint
for
failure
to
state
a
cause
of
action.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
in
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
hand,
reversed
and
remanded
the
case
for
trial
on
the
merits.
i
will
briefly
recite
the
facts
as
they
are
alleged
in
the
complaint
in
the
affidavits
attached
thereto
since
there
is,
of
course,
no
further
record
in
this
case.
the
respondent,
mr.
rychlik,
was
employed
by
pennsylvania
railroad
as
a
trainman
and
was
dismissed
from
service
in
january
of
1955.
prior
to
this
time,
the
union
shop
amendment
to
railway
labor
act,
section
2,
eleventh
of
that
act,
was
passed
by
congress
in,
i
believe,
january
of
1951.
and,
in
march
of
1952,
the
railroad
company
and
the
brotherhood,
the
railroad
trainmen
which
was
a
duly
asserted
representative
of
the
trainmen
on
the
pennsylvania,
entered
into
a
union-shop
agreement
in
conformity
with
the
amendment.
in
substantially
the
words
of
this
statute,
the
agreement
provided
that
all
trainmen
employed
by
pennsylvania,
as
a
condition
of
their
continued
employment,
must
become
members
of
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
and
maintain
membership
in
good
standing
in
the
union.
the
agreement
further
provided,
as
required
by
the
statute,
that
a
trainman
could
satisfy
this
requirement
of
membership
by
holding
or
acquiring
membership
in
any
one
of
the
other
labor
organizations,
national
in
scope,
organized
in
accordance
with
the
railway
labor
act
and
admitting
to
membership
employees
of
a
craft
or
class
in
engine,
train,
yard,
or
hostling
service.
there
is
a
special
provision
in
section
2,
eleventh
(c)
of
the
railway
labor
act
which
applies
to
union-shop
agreements
between
railroads
and
their
employees
in
what
we
call
the
operating
classes.
they
are,
generally
speaking,
engineers,
firemen,
hostlers,
conductors,
brakemen,
and
other
trainmen.
there
was
a
specific
problem,
which
will
be
discussed
in
more
detail
later,
which
required
a
little
different
treatment
than
the
union-shop
amendment
between
the
operating
unions
and
the
non-operating
classes,
who
are,
generally
speaking,
the
clerks
and
others
not
directly
engaged
in
the
movement
of
a
train.
as
a
result,
there
is
a
--
the
specific
language
of
the
statute
states
that
the
requirement
of
membership
in
a
labor
organization
in
an
agreement
made
pursuant
to
section
2,
eleventh
(c)
shall
be
satisfied
as
to
a
present
or
future
employee
in
engine,
train,
yard,
or
hostling
service.
that
is,
an
employee
engaged
in
any
of
the
services
covered
in
section
3,
first
(h)
of
the
act,
that
is,
a
provision
defining
certain
jurisdiction
of
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
it
says
that
the
requirement
of
membership
shall
be
satisfied
if
such
an
employee
holds
or
acquires
membership
in
any
one
of
the
labor
organizations,
national
in
scope,
organized
in
accordance
with
this
act
and
admitting
to
membership
employees
of
such
a
class
or
craft.
at
first,
the
respondent
rychlik,
was
a
member
of
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
in
good
standing.
however,
in
9
--
in
february
of
1953,
he
resigned
his
membership
in
the
brotherhood
and
became
a
member
of
another
union,
united
railroad
operating
crafts,
which
he
--
well,
the
complaint
states
he
believed,
in
good
faith,
to
be
national
in
scope.
and,
thereafter,
respondent
and
other
trainmen
in
similar
situation
who
had
given
up
their
brt
membership
in
favor
of
united
railroad
operating
crafts
which,
if
you
don't
mind,
i'll
call
uroc
because
that
is
a
preferred
method
of
referring
to
it,
were
cited
to
the
railroad
by
the
brotherhood
because
of
alleged
failure
to
comply
with
the
union-shop
agreement.
now,
under
this
agreement,
the
railroad
and
the
brotherhood
had
established
a
system
board
of
adjustment,
which
is
provided
for
under
section
3,
second
of
the
railway
labor
act,
to
settle
any
disputes
arising
in
connection
with
the
union-shop
agreement.
section
3,
second
provides
an
orderly
means
of
settling
these
minor
disputes
to
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board,
and
specifically
state
that
any
carrier
or
group
of
carriers
can
establish
a
regional
or
system
board
of
adjustment
with
the
same
jurisdiction
as
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
provided
for
in
section
3,
first.
this
union-shop
agreement,
then,
provided
that
the
system
board
had
jurisdiction
over
disputes
under
the
union-shop
agreement
and,
further,
it
provided,
as
is
normal
in
the
case
of
such
system
boards,
that
the
railroad
and
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
would
each
have
two
representatives
on
the
system
board.
in
case
of
a
deadlock,
the
deadlock
was
to
be
broken
by
a
decision
of
a
neutral
appointed
by
the
national
mediation
board.
the
agreement
provided
that
the
decision
of
the
system
board
would
be
final
and
binding.
after
the
respondent
was
cited
for
noncompliance
with
union-shop
agreement,
he
was
given
a
hearing
before
the
system
board
in
august
1953,
and
the
second
hearing
was
held
a
year
later,
in
august
1954,
without
any
further
action
having
been
taken
against
him,
in
the
meantime,
under
the
agreement.
the
system
board
eventually
came
to
the
conclusion
that
respondent
had
failed
to
comply
with
the
union-shop
agreement,
that
his
membership
in
united
railroad
operating
crafts
did
not
constitute
compliance
with
the
union-shop
agreement.
as
a
result,
he
was
discharged
from
service
in
january
of
1955.
there
was
evidence
at
the
hearing
before
the
system
board
in
august
of
1954
that,
in
the
previous
month,
respondent
had
joined
the
switchmen's
union
of
--
of
north
america,
which
is
generally
recognized
as
being
a
qualified
labor
union,
national
in
scope,
and
fitting
the
terms
that
i
have
quoted
from
the
union-shop
amendment.
and,
the
complainant
alleges
also
that
the
respondent,
at
some
time
after
he
first
resigned
from
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen,
had
tendered
his
dues
and
applied
for
reinstatement.
after
his
discharge,
the
respondent
filled
this
suit
in
the
district
court
alleging
these
facts
i
have
stated,
and
asking
--
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
mr.
justice
burton,
the
act
provides
that
you
can
join
but
the
act
has
been
construed
to
require
that
you
cannot
resign
from
the
collective
bargaining
agent
and,
thereafter,
some
months
later,
meet
the
responsibilities
or
requirements
of
the
agreement
by,
then,
joining
another
union.
he
had
resigned
from
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
in
february
of
1953.
the
evidence
alleged
here
of
joining
the
switchmen's
union.
it's
evidenced
that
he
joined
in
july
of
1954,
after
about,
i
believe,
17
--
15,
or
16,
or
17
months
of
not
belonging,
under
this
decision
of
the
system
board,
to
any
union,
national
in
scope
or
coverage.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
the
district
court,
in
this
case,
ruled
that
it
did
not,
citing
the
(inaudible)
case
which
is
referred
to
in
the
briefs,
which
is,
i
believe,
a
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
in
which
this
court
had
denied
certiorari.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
that's
--
that's
correct.
he
may
--
i
believe
he
may
still
be
a
member
of
switchmen's
union
but
the
--
the
district
court,
in
this
case,
held
that
the
fact
he
joined
the
switchmen's
union
did
not
warrant
the
court
in
exercising
its
equal
powers
of
intervention
and
the
second
circuit
did
not
discuss
the
point
in
its
opinion.
the
complaint
which
was
filed
in
the
district
court
alleged
that
the
--
his
discharge
violated
the
act.
one
of
the
grounds
alleged
was
that
which
mr.
justice
burton
has
raised.
he
--
he
stated
that,
after
he
had
joined
the
switchmen's
union,
despite
this
lapse
in
membership
in
--
from
the
brotherhood
of
the
railroad
trainmen
until
the
time
he
joined
the
switchmen's
union,
he
alleged
that
that
discharge
after
he
joined
the
switchmen's
union
was
a
violation
of
the
railway
labor
act.
he
also
alleged
that
his
discharge
after
he
had
applied
for
reinstatement
in
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
and
had
tendered
his
dues
was
a
violation
of
the
act.
and,
he
further
alleged
that
the
railway
labor
act
had
been
violated
by
this
agreement
in
the
establishing
of
a
system
board
under
section
3,
second
to
decide
these
disputes
in
providing
for
brotherhood
representation
on
the
system
board
and
in
stating
that
the
board
awards
would
be
final
and
binding.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
entire
complaint
for
failure
to
state
the
cause
of
action,
not
on
the
ground
of
jurisdiction
but
for
failure
to
state
a
cause
of
action.
the
court
ruled
that
the
agreement
was
valid,
the
union-shop
agreement.
it
ruled
that
the
system
board,
under
the
act,
had
jurisdiction
over
any
dispute
arising
under
the
union-shop
agreement
and
it
held
that
the
brotherhood
representation
on
the
system
board
did
not
per
se
make
the
board's
decision
invalid.
the
court
specifically
rule
on
the
question
of
the
respondent's
membership
in
the
switchmen's
union
and,
also,
on
the
refusal
of
the
brotherhood
to
reinstate
him
and
held
that
neither
of
these
grounds
require
the
court
to
exercise
its
right
to
intervene,
to
protect
the
respondent.
the
court
rule
that,
with
regard
to
the
status
of
uroc
as
a
union,
possibly
national
in
scope,
it
was
not
necessary
for
the
court
to
reach
this
decision
under
the
facts
which
were
submitted
to
the
district
court.
and,
the
--
and,
the
district
court
pointed
to
the
administrative
procedure
provided
in
section
3
of
the
act
as
the
exclusive
method
of
determining
this
issue.
now,
the
administrative
procedure
to
which
the
court
there
referred
is
the
procedure
provided
by
the
railway
labor
act
for
determining
whether
a
union
is
qualified
to
participate
in
selecting
members
of
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
section
3,
first
(a)
of
the
act
provides
that
an
adjustment
board
--
the
adjustment
board
shall
consist
of
members
to
be
selected
by
the
carriers
and
by
such
labor
organizations
of
the
employees,
national
in
scope,
has,
have
been,
or
may
be
organized
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
section
2
of
this
act.
section
3,
first
(f)
provides
that
if
there
is
a
dispute
as
to
the
right
of
any
union
to
participate
in
this
selection,
the
dispute
will
be
investigated
by
the
secretary
of
labor
who
will
make
a
determination,
preliminarily,
as
to
whether
the
claim
has
merit.
and,
if
in
his
judgment,
it
has
merit,
the
secretary
is
told
to
notify
the
mediation
board
and,
after
receipt
of
that
advice,
the
mediation
board
sets
up
a
board
of
three.
one
representative
of
the
labor
unions
already
recognized
as
national
in
scope,
for
this
purpose,
one
representative
of
the
claimant
union,
and
a
neutral
appointed
by
the
mediation
board
which
makes
a
final
and
binding
determination
as
to
whether
the
union
is
qualified
to
participate
in
the
selection
of
members
of
the
adjustment
board.
this
was
pointed
to
by
the
district
court
as
being
a
remedy
with
regard
to
determining
this
question
and,
on
the
basis
of
the
pigott
case
which
had
been
decided
by
the
sixth
circuit
at
that
time,
the
court
--
district
court
indicated,
pretty
clearly,
it
believed
that
this
was
the
exclusive
method
under
the
railway
labor
act
to
determine
whether
a
union
was
national
in
scope
not
only
for
the
purpose
of
picking
adjustment
board
members,
but
also
for
purposes
of
the
union-shop
amendment.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
the
complaint
alleged
that
the
steps
had
been
taken
by
uroc
toward
determining
its
status
under
that
procedure.
i'm
not
sure
whether
it's
in
the
complaint
or
in
one
of
the
affidavits,
but
i
believe
it's
in
there
at
some
point,
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
it's
a
little
difficult
to
tell.
i
haven't
--
i
can
find
the
language
which
regard
to
that
point,
mr.
justice
brennan.
it's
on
page
33
of
the
record,
mr.
justice
brennan.
it
is
not
necessary
for
this
court
to
decide
under
the
facts
submitted
in
this
case
whether
uroc
is
a
labor
organization,
national
in
scope.
in
fact,
that
function
on
the
railway
labor
act
is
left
as
specific
administrative
procedure.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
you
could
construe
the
court
as
relying
pretty
heavily
on
the
exclusiveness
of
the
procedure.
when
this
case
--
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
--
came
--
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
it
is
--
it
is
my
understanding,
mr.
justice
burton,
that
a
union
which
wants
to
participate,
presumably
with,
first,
not
to
try
to
start
--
stir
up
a
fight
with
the
other
unions
but
would
try
to
see
if
they
would
agree
to
let
it
participate.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
i
was
--
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
i
was
--
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
the
members
of
the
board
do
not
serve
for
any
definite
term.
they
could
be
changed
at
will
and
they
are
frequently
on
for
as
little
as
two
or
three
days
before
being
replaced
with
the
result
that,
for
the
purpose
of
the
adjustment
board,
a
union
can
come
in
anytime.
now,
i
would
presume
that
how
quickly
that
would
be
decided
would
depend,
to
a
large
extent,
on
how
quickly
the
secretary
of
labor
acted
under
this
--
these
provisions
here.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
at
any
time.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
i
think
--
i
think,
mr.
justice
burton,
that
the
appendix
or
the
respondent's
brief,
in
this
case,
indicates
that
they
have
started
it
but
they
started
it,
i
believe,
in
1954
--
in
july
1954.
it
was
prior
to
the
discharge
of
this
respondent
here.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
--
but
that
the
record
itself,
in
this
case,
is
not
clear
on
that
point.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
remanded
the
case
for
trial
on
the
merits.
judge
hand,
in
his
opinion,
said
that
there
must
be
review
of
the
system
board
award
because
of
the
bias
implicit
in
the
brotherhood
representation
on
that
board.
he
held
that
the
administrative
procedure
provided
in
section
3
is
--
section
3,
first
(f)
procedure
was
not
appropriate
for
determining
the
issue
of
whether
a
union
is
national
in
scope
under
the
union-shop
amendment
and
that,
in
any
event,
the
procedure
was
not
available
to
the
respondent
as
an
individual.
and,
judge
hand
said
that
the
individual
had
a
right
to
an
impartial
determination
as
to
whether
uroc
was
national
in
scope.
the
petitioners
here
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
holding
that
the
brotherhood
representation
completely
nullified
the
award
of
the
system
board
and
in
holding
that,
under
these
circumstances,
the
merits
of
the
case
should
be
reviewed
by
the
district
court.
we
submit
further
that
the
court
erred
in
failing
to
hold
that
this
section
3
procedure
is
the
exclusive
procedure
under
the
act
for
determining
whether
a
union
is
national
in
scope
for
the
purpose
of
the
union-shop
amendment.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
i
would
--
i
believe
that
judge
hand
directed
the
case
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
for
a
trial
on
the
merits
of
every
issue
that
was
before
the
system
board
of
adjustment.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
when
he
talks
of
the
--
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
i
--
i
--
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
i
feel,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
believe
that
--
i
would
concede
that,
in
my
opinion,
mr.
justice
hand
rather
loosely
construed
the
complaint
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
he
construed
it
--
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
i
believe
he
construed
the
complaint
to
substantially
allege
that
these
individuals,
in
good
faith,
joined
a
new
union,
uroc,
and
had
given
up
their
membership
in
the
brotherhood
which
held
the
union-shop
agreement
and
that
they
had,
thereafter,
been
forced
to
go
before
a
board
which
had
a
brotherhood
member
on
it.
and,
then,
had
a
decision
to
discharge
them
and
that
judge
hand
ruled
that
the
pleading
construed
as
an
appeal
for
relief
from
that
decision
of
the
system
board
and,
on
the
allegations
that
they
had
joined
a
union
they
believed
to
be
national
in
scope,
merited
respondent
here
in
having
an
impartial
decision
as
to
whether
the
union
was
national
in
scope.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
that's
right.
i
would
--
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
that's
right.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
that's
right.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
yes,
sir.
may
i
--
may
i
quickly
--
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
may
i
--
may
i
quickly
--
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
may
i
quickly
cover
it
in
brief
outline
the
points
which
i
would
first
like
to
make.
in
the
first
place,
we
have
had
these
bipartisan
boards
under
the
--
the
railway
labor
act
since
1926.
what
the
pennsylvania
brief
shows
in
detail
is
procedure
set
forth
in
the
act
and,
for
these
boards,
a
procedure
which
was
followed
very
closely
in
setting
up
this
board
under
the
union-shop
agreement.
thus,
there
is
nothing
new
or
novel
in
a
bipartisan
board
of
this
kind.
and,
this
court,
of
course,
has
held
in
the
slocum
case
and
e,
j
&
e
case
that
the
purpose
of
these
boards
is
to
settle
these
minor
disputes
and
keep
them
out
of
the
courts
and
to
keep
peace
in
the
railroad
industry.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
the
second
point
is
that
there
is
nothing
new
or
novel
in
having
an
opposition
between
an
individual
whether
or
not
--
an
individual
employee,
whether
or
not
he
is
a
union
member,
and
the
union
that
there
is
nothing
new
or
novo
except
that
in
the
union-shop
situation,
under
these
agreements,
there
is
a
greater
focus,
perhaps,
on
that
because
it
is
implicit
in
those
cases.
congress
has
seen
fit
to
provide
that
there
will
be
a
conflict
of
interest
there
between
the
union
and
an
employee.
however,
that
can
happen
in
any
case
that
goes
before
the
national
adjustment
board
or
a
system
board
because,
in
the
most
--
picayune
pay
claim,
that
claim
may
very
well
be
contrary
to
union
policy.
unions
--
as
a
result,
particularly
of
course
in
the
seniority
cases
which
have
been
referred
to
in
the
briefs,
there
is
constant
area
where
there
may
be
conflict
between
these
gentlemen
on
the
system
boards
or
on
the
national
board
and
employees
appearing
before
those
boards.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
but,
there
has
always
--
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
--
been
a
presumption
of
validity
--
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
--
of
the
decisions
there.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
the
veteran
cases
or
any
cases
where
the
union
has
to
side
with
one
group
or
another.
the
union-shop
amendment,
of
course,
sides
with
all
its
members
against
someone
who
is
believed
not
to
be
incompliance.
but,
there
is
nothing
new
or
novel
in
this
which
would
require
this
court
or
the
court
below
to
carve
out
or
to
try
to
carve
out
a
small
section
of
cases
where
it
feels
that,
as
the
respondents
put
it
in
their
briefs,
here,
you
have
a
higher
degree
of
hostility
but
that
hostility
can
and
does
exist
in
many
types
of
cases
and
it
will,
in
our
opinion,
seriously
--
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
--
affect
the
work
in
--
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
in
my
opinion,
it
--
you
can
draw
that
question
of
degree
here.
you
can
have
as
much
hostility
against
an
individual
who
--
even
if
he's
a
member,
who
someone
dislikes
as
you
can
get.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
well,
your
honor,
of
course,
we
haven't
gotten
any
record
of
actual
facts
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
it
was
unanimous.
but,
what
i
would
like
to
say
is
we,
--
we
--
as
the
railroad
here
and
also
as
the
brother
--
in
behalf
of
the
brotherhood,
we
aren't
saying
you
cannot
have
a
review
of
these
cases
but
we
feel
it
should
be
a
limited
review
and
that
there
should
be
a
presumption
that
these
boards,
established
under
the
railway
labor
act,
have
acted
properly.
we
feel
that
there
should
be
review
as
to
procedure
to
see
whether
the
act
has
been
carried
out
and
as
to
whether
there
had
been
any
gross
error,
but
we
do
not
feel
that,
in
any
case
where
there's
alleged
hostility,
the
federal
court
should
then
step
in
because
of
a
presumption
of
bias.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
from
this
court,
sir?
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
i
believe
that
there
is
no
case.
i'm
relying,
primarily,
on
the
history
of
the
railway
labor
act
in
the
interpretation
by
this
court.
however,
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
this
case
has
held
in
the
--
this
--
this
court
has
held
in
the,
i
believe,
the
second
opinion
in
the
e,
j
&
e
case
that
there
is
a
presumption
of
the
validity
of
determinations
of
these
boards
in
327
us.
in
that
case,
of
course,
it
was
a
question
of
--
of
the
authority
of
the
union
to
represent
and
bind
the
individual.and,
the
court
said,
through
mr.
justice
rutledge,
moreover,
when
an
award
of
the
adjustment
board
involving
an
employee's
individual
grievance
is
challenged
in
the
courts,
one
who
would
upset
it
carries
the
burden
of
showing
that
it
was
wrong.
its
act
--
its
action,
meaning
the
boards
action,
in
adjusting
an
individual
employee's
grievance
at
the
instance
of
the
collective
bargaining
agent
is
entitled
to
presumptive
weight.
we
feel
that
same
weight
should
carry
over
through
union-shop
disputes
of
any
kind.
whether
a
man
has
paid
his
dues,
whether
the
union
he
belongs
to
conforms
to
the
requirement
of
the
act,
there
should
be
a
presumption
and,
unless
real
evidence
of
error
of
prejudicial
bias
is
shown,
that
they
should
not
be
reviewed
in
the
courts
on
the
merits.
that
the
second
circuit,
if
it
found
that
this
completely
wiped
out
the
validity
of
the
award,
should
have
returned
this
dispute
to
the
parties
on
the
property
rather
than
directing
the
district
court
to
decide
on
the
merits.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
mr.
kaiser,
sir,
will
discuss
the
second
point
with
regard
to
explicitness
of
the
remedy.
