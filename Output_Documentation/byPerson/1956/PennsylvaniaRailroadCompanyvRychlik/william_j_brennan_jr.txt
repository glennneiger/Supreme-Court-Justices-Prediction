justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
think
you
said
that
the
district
court
did
not
turn
its
decision
on
the
exclusiveness
of
that
remedy
but,
rather,
on
the
ground
that
the
complaint
did
not
state
the
cause
of
action.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
doesn't
counsel
suppose,
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
kind,
that
the
problems
of
dual
unionism
are
a
little
different
from
the
ones
you've
been
talking
about?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
motivations
for
the
hostility,
though,
might
be
very
different,
i
should
think.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather,
the
system
board
determination
on
this
charge
here
was
unanimous,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me,
mr.
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
kaiser.
might
mr.
rychlik,
or
how
we
pronounce
that,
might
he
have
retained
his
membership
in
the
brotherhood
while
a
member
in
uroc?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
nothing
in
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
nothing
between
the
carrier
with
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
a
different
case
than
you
got
here
though.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
not
the
case
you're
arguing
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
haven't
got
that
case
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
an
interesting
question
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
we
could
reach
later
on,
but
your
point
is
that
it's
that
procedure
that
is
involved
here.
the
absence
of
which,
makes
this
case
a
failure
to
state
a
cause
of
action,
to
put
it
that
way.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
your
point,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
suggest
that
national
in
scope,
for
the
purpose
of
being
an
elector,
is
different
from
some
other
national
in
scope?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
isn't
that
the
case
before
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
follow
that.
you
have
a
date
set
for
sometime
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
haven't
dated
at
all.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
will
--
will
you
tell
us
why
it
is
you
haven't
gone
back?
you
answered
mr.
justice
clark
that
even
though
nothing's
happened
in
two
years
since
he
sent
you,
you
say,
to
the
participating
agencies.
why
haven't
you
gone
back
to
him?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
letter
from
whom?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
you
have
not
been
back
to
the
secretary
of
labor,
i
understand.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
any
reason
why
not?
can
you
tell
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
couldn't
you
have
different
determinations
by
different
courts
if
you
had
different
cases
of
different
employees?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what
--
what's
controlling
about
the
secretary's
definition
upon
either
the
employee
or
the
district
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
arguing
that
congress
did
so
intend?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
it
a
generally
accepted
meaning
for
example
if
the
“national
in
scope”,
the
members
of
the
union
must
be
of
several
employees
rather
than
of
a
single
employer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
--
what
about
unions
for
example
in
other
industries
like
the
long
lines
union
or
the
telephone
system?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
you
--
do
you
suggest
that
it's
commonly
understood
only
in
the
railroads?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what
about
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what
about
the
long
lines
union
and
the
telephone
industry?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
as
i
understand
it,
that
union
is
made
up
only
of
employees
of
the
companies
as
a
bell
system.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
does
not
make
it
rather
difficult
to
argue
that
there's
any
ordinarily,
commonly,
accepted
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
idea
about
a
union
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
except
that
one
of
those
characteristics,
didn't
you
tell
us
was
that
the
employees
--
the
union
members
must
be
employees
of
many
employers.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
several
employers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
doesn't
that
come
down
again
to
an
argument
that
this
is
a
term
with
special
meaning
in
the
railroad
industry
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what
--
would
you
be
better
off
if
you
have
to
prove
that
your
eligibility
as
a
union
of
“national
in
scope”
in
court
would
contribute
to
the
secretary?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
that's
the
union
alone?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
your
act
were
able
to
command
the
support
of
a
large
majority
of
a
given
craft,
what's
the
procedure
by
which
it
may
become
the
recognized
bargaining
agent
to
that
effect.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
has
nothing
to
do
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
with
having
“national
in
scope.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
what
--
what
i'm
interested
in
is
if
that
should
come
about,
i
gather
then
that
uroc
would
have
a
contract
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
would
apply,
would
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
--
but
in
terms
of
representation
on
the
system
adjustment
board,
it
would
not
be
eligible
notwithstanding
it
as
recognized
and
had
a
contract
with
the
road
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
as
eligible
to
be
an
elector
on
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
this
--
in
that
circumstance,
then
i
gather,
any
grievance
that
had
to
go
to
a
board
would
have
to
go
to
the
national
board,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
on
which
system
board
it
would
have
no
representation
because
it
would
not
have
qualified
as
a
“national
is
scope”?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
but
its
--
would
uroc
in
that
circumstance
be
entitled
representation
on
the
system
board?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
not
“national
in
scope”.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
might
we
properly
add
to,
to
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
suggested
the
personal
interest
of
the
individual
system
board
member
that
if
his
union
is
ousted,
he
maybe
ousted
from
a
union
position
which
accounts
for
his
being
a
member
of
the
system
board.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
may
lose
for
that
reason.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
rather
you
--
rather
an
interest
than
hostility.
