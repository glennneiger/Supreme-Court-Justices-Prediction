justice
john
m.
harlan
are
you
going
to
come
out
at
all
upon
the
government's
suggestion
in
their
amicus
brief?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
your
view
of
the
act,
i
take
it,
the
question
of
court
review,
judicial
review
would
arise
in
a
proceeding
under
the
provisions
of
the
act
that
relate
to
qualifying
as
a
national
union.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
deny
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
interrupt
you
for
a
moment
there?
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
we
disagree
with
you
on
that,
would
you
then
agree
that
that
would
be
dispositive
of
this
case
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
and
that
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
court
review
of
the
statutory
review
board
is
not
involved
in
this
case,
you
don't
reach
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
suppose
that
i
did
disagree
with
you
on
all
those
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
would
end
your
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
procedure
that
you're
referring
to
is
not
(inaudible)
whether
representation
on
the
board,
whether
the
union
is
to
qualify
as
an
elector.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
--
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
is
there
any
procedure
in
the
railway
labor
act
for
setting
up
an
adjustment
board
composed
otherwise
in
this
board
was
composed?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
that
in
order
to
obviate
this
conflict
of
interest
that
you're
arguing,
you
have
to
set
up
some
kind
of
a
board
for
which
the
act
decides
no
machinery.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
