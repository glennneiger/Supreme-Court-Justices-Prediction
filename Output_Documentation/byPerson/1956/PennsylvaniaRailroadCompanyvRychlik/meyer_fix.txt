mr.
meyer
fix
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
get
more
or
less
a
preface
in
my
remark
that
one
little
comment,
mr.
justice
reed,
if
you
look
at
page
26
of
the
pennsylvania
brief,
there's
a
footnote
number
four
that
conceives
as
mr.
spindelman
alluded
to
it
that
there
is
no
question
--
mr.
meyer
fix
page
26
of
the
--
mr.
meyer
fix
that
is
true.
mr.
meyer
fix
that
is
a
fair
statement
about
this
certain
point
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
we
have
two
problems
here.
does
the
contract
itself
have
as
the
steele
case
says,
does
the
contract
itself
defend
these
men
from
having
a
fair
right
to
work.
or
assuming
the
contract
is
fair,
do
the
members
who
sit
on
the
system
board
per
se
as
judge
hand
said
make
the
decision
subject
of
bias
or
subject
to
review
because
of
the
fact
we
have
no
place
else
to
go
but
first
to
the
system
board
with
a
biased
board,
biased
member
and
then
we
all
too
because
the
context
says
final
and
binding
as
to
that.
mr.
meyer
fix
the
--
mr.
meyer
fix
very
true,
very
true.
now
--
so
the
question
primarily
is,
the
court
please,
do
we
state
a
cause
of
action
that
is
why
we
are
here?
the
lower
court,
the
district
court
that
is
said
we
did
not,
the
court
of
appeals
with
judge
hand,
unanimous
opinion
said
we
did
and
now
we're
here.
we
submit,
if
the
court
please,
that
there
is
a
cause
of
action
mentioned
in
the
complaint
and
we
have
the
right
to
prove
the
allegations
set
forth
in
our
complaint.
this
is
only
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint
because
judge
(inaudible),
the
district
court
said
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
our
complaint
did
not
state
a
cause
of
action
for
the
reason
that
the
men
who
sat
on
the
system
board
are
not
proven
to
be
bias.
give
us
a
chance
to
prove
it
and
that's
why
we're
here
in
court
now.
we
--
mr.
meyer
fix
my
trouble
too.
mr.
meyer
fix
at
the
trial
we
had
proved
not
only
the
fact
that
they
--
these
two
men
represented
the
competing
union
but
also
deliberately
they
wrote
letters
to
the
effect.
i
have
a
letter
here
but
it's
not
in
the
record.
they
wrote
letters
to
the
effect,
i'm
going
to
see
to
it
that
this
man
is
kept
out
of
work
because
he's
a
member
of
uroc.
mr.
meyer
fix
well,
we
say
discrimination
and
conspiracy,
your
honor.
in
paragraph
11,
page
6,
the
--
mr.
meyer
fix
to
compel
the
defendant
something
that
is
charged,
mr.
frankfurter.
mr.
meyer
fix
that's
right.
mr.
meyer
fix
well,
that
comes
back
in
paragraph
(g)
in
paragraph
19,
your
honor.
mr.
meyer
fix
well,
let
me
say
this
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
as
our
complaint
gives
notice
to
the
railroad
and
to
the
defendants
that
we
have
a
cause
of
action
against
them.
we
put
them
on
notice
of
the
fact
that
we
have
grievances
against
this
setup
that
has
been
created
not
only
by
the
contract.
and
having
--
and
under
the
liberality
if
you
want
to
put
it
that
way
of
the
rules
of
practices
we
have
now,
i
believe
we
can
put
that
in
and
have
it
in
both
ways
not
only
on
the
identity
of
the
--
of
these
men
but
also
on
what
they
have
actually
done.
mr.
meyer
fix
well,
if
you
got
a
--
mr.
meyer
fix
that's
right.
mr.
meyer
fix
well,
let's
say
under
the
--
perhaps
it's
--
it's
corroborative
truths
of
bias
there
because
of
these
men
should
say
we
are
trying
to
be
as
impartial
as
possible
and
we
still
decide
on
the
evidences
presented
in
an
organization
called
uroc
of
which
this
man
rychlik
is
a
member
is
so
as
not
“national
in
scope”
then
we
have
a
right
to
show
active
biases
against
presumed
bias.
mr.
meyer
fix
that's
right
--
that's
right
--
that's
--
mr.
meyer
fix
i
agree
with
you.
mr.
meyer
fix
now,
the
railroad
and
the
brt
say
that
there
should
not
be
judicial
review
simply
because
the
--
you
cannot
assume
that
these
men
are
biased.
well
i've
already
have
covered
that
if
your
honor
please
and
i
think
that
we
can
go
on
to
the
next
point.
as
far
as
bias
is
concerned
in
my
brief
on
pages
--
on
page
10,
in
the
footnote,
we
have
set
forth
various
situations
showing
where
these
men
sitting
in
judgment
in
a
situation
or
in
a
factual
problem
in
which
they
are
vitally
interested
in
all
these
different
situations,
the
courts
have
held,
starting
with
the
tumey
against
ohio
case
in
273
u.s.the
courts
have
held
that
such
a
situation
prevents
these
men
from
sitting
in
judgment.
and
on
tumey
case
as
your
honors
know,
a
judge
was
interested
in
the
fine
that
he
was
going
to
receive
if
he
found
certain
people
guilty
of
committing
certain
traffic
violations
and
the
court
held
that
that
is
not
good
as
a
matter
of
law.
and
so
similarly
all
the
way
down
to
the
murchison
case
recently
in
349
u.s,
the
court
held
that
in
a
case
of
a
one-man
grand
jury,
the
judge
who
cited
this
man
for
contempt
cannot
sit
ultimately
in
the
decision
of
whether
he
was
actually
in
contempt
or
not
because
the
court
said
that
fairness
requires
an
--
an
absence
of
actual
bias
in
the
trial
of
cases
and
our
system
of
law
has
always
endeavored
to
prevent
the
probability
of
unfairness
and
that's
what
we
have
here
that
probability
of
unfairness
because
these
men
and
they
are
union
men.
you
don't
have
men
in
the
judicial
capacity.
they
are
union
men,
brotherhood
men
who
are
saying,
“i'm
going
to
see
that
you're
going
to
lose
your
job
because
you
belong
to
another
organization
and
that
way,
you
can't
get
any
place
at
all.”
and
so
therefore,
we
feel
that
the
argument
that
they
make
doesn't
stand
up
at
all
by
the
very
effect
which
is
the
established
law
here
in
the
tumey
case
and
so
forth.
now
--
mr.
meyer
fix
no,
there
isn't,
unless
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
meyer
fix
that
is
true
unless
they
do
it
voluntarily
as
between
--
mr.
meyer
fix
--
the
bargaining
agent
and
the
railroad
itself.
and
that
is
what
i
think
judge
hand
said
that
they
let
--
leave
it
up
to
them
but
the
system
as
it
is
now
is
defective
for
the
reason
that
you've
just
indicated.
now
i
don't
think
--
let
me
say
this.
the
judicial
review
which
is
what
they're
talking
about,
they
say
judicial
review
will
be
inevitable
and
all
of
these
men
who
were
about
to
lose
their
jobs
will
run
to
court
whenever
they
feel
that
the
--
that
the
system
as
setup
isn't
fair
to
them
or
easily
don't
get
the
right
answers.
and
to
answer
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
--
i
say
this
that
the
--
it
isn't
affect
the
case
that
these
men
will
be
running
to
court
every
time
they
are
being
fired
rather
is
a
case,
the
system
as
it
setup
is
such
that
they
have
no
choice
but
to
go
court.
but
then
again,
how
many
competing
unions
will
there
be
in
the
lifetime
of
these
various
organizations?
frankly,
this
uroc
organization
got
started
about
four
or
five
years
ago
and
has
been
having
relatively
rough
time
for
the
simple
reason
that
men
have
been
fired
whenever
the
powers
that
be
in
the
brotherhoods
have
found
out
that
they
belong
to
another
organization
and
at
the
same
time
have
dropped
out,
out
of
the
brt
by
not
saying
their
dues
unless
the
only
situation.
and
so
therefore
we
feel
as
was
said
in
the
edwards
case
which
i
--
which
we
have
quoted
on
page
11
that
in
that
case,
judicial
review
was
possible
and
therefore
the
judicial
review
is
possible.
not
so
much
because
of
the
--
to
prove
bias
as
it
is
actually
because
of
various
setup
order
system
that
we
have.
now
finally,
if
the
court
please,
the
situation
comes
down
to
this.
the
--
we
have
a
question
of
not
so
much
economics
but
broad
union
backgrounds.
as
was
indicated
yesterday,
i
believe
mr.
kaiser
said
so
these
men
are
entrenched
and
it
should
be
no
--
no
more
new
unions
that
come
to
the
act
as
far
as
section
3,
first
(f)
is
concerned,
contemplates
the
formation
of
new
unions
because
it
says
“any
new
union
--
any
union
organized
in
the
future.”
we
feel
that
whether
or
not
the
brt
or
any
other
labor
organization
individual
industry
conforms
to
any
particular
system
to
recognize
the
rights
of
the
minority,
that's
up
to
them.
but
we
feel,
if
the
court
please,
that
whatever
system
there
is,
if
there's
to
be
a
new
union
recognized
of
these
men
who
are
members
of
the
brt
field,
they
are
dissatisfied
and
they
form
not
in
one
little
localized
area
but
throughout
the
country
another
organization.
and
in
this
case,
if
your
honors
please,
we
have
a
basic
point
and
that
is
an
industry
union
on
the
railroad
as
against
the
craft
union
within
the
railroad.
that
is
fundamentally
i
think
what
we're
going
to
have
here
as
far
as
not
to
call
it
a
revolution
but
to
call
it
a
switch.
then
we
have
the
question
they're
doing
everything
possible
so
therefore
they're
firing
these
men
whenever
they
dropout.
sure
as
you
say
--
mr.
meyer
fix
simply
by
having
a
road
taken
on
that
particular
railroad.
mr.
meyer
fix
with
the
“national
in
scope”
mr.
meyer
fix
yes.
because
if
--
assuming
mr.
justice
brennan
you
have
a
railroad
within
a
particular
craft,
say
a
thousand
men
and
the
uroc
men
get
501
votes
in
their
favor,
they
are
the
bargaining
agent
for
the
entire
1000
men.
and
if,
as
mr.
spindelman
indicated
before,
they
should
lose
the
next
election
and
they
got
a
double
head
so
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
meyer
fix
right.
mr.
meyer
fix
right.
and
they
have
done
so.
mr.
meyer
fix
yes.
mr.
meyer
fix
that
is
true.
but
the
act
as
mr.
boyd's
letter
at
--
appendix
to
the
government
brief
indicates
the
government
prefers
system
board
as
against
reference
of
these
matters
to
the
entire
adjusting
boards.
and
these
system
boards
can
be
set
up
on
each
railroad
as
between
union
and
the
railroad.
mr.
meyer
fix
no.
any
grievances
then
could
be
taken
care
of.
but
then
the
framework
setup
by
his
own
grievance
committee
of
the
system
board
setup
on
the
railroad
itself
--
mr.
meyer
fix
--
as
between.
mr.
meyer
fix
well,
you
got
to
distinguish
between
the
adjustment
board
and
the
system
board.
the
system
board
is
only
on
the
railroad.
the
adjustment
board
is
a
national
organization,
18
men.
mr.
meyer
fix
not
--
on
the
system
board,
yes.
mr.
meyer
fix
--
to
represent
the
men.
mr.
meyer
fix
right,
right,
right.
i
believe
my
--
i
see
both
light,
sir.
i
believe
my
time
is
up.
mr.
meyer
fix
thank
you
very
much.
