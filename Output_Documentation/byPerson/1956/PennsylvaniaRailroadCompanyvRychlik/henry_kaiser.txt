mr.
henry
kaiser
may
it
please
the
court.
now,
the
point
to
which
i
address
my
remarks
illuminates
completely
any
questions
of
hostility
or
conflict
between
the
employee
and
the
statutory
representative.
i
start
with
the
rather
startling
statement
that,
in
my
judgment,
the
premise
upon
which
the
court
below
reached
the
result
it
did
means
certain
chaos
in
railway
labor
relations.
now,
let's
examine
precisely
the
reasoning
adopted
by
the
court
below.
it,
in
effect,
conceded
that
the
section
3
procedure
that
mr.
clattenburg
described
was
a
thoroughly
impartial
unbiased
procedure,
but
it
certainly
reject
that
procedure
and
it
asserted
two
reasons
for
that
rejection.
now,
i
past
by
that
first
reason
namely
that
the
qualifications
imposed
by
the
statute
upon
labor
organizations
in
order
to
be
able
to
select
members
to
the
board
are
different
from
the
qualifications
appearing
in
the
union-shop
amendment
of
1951.
i
say,
if
i
may,
that
the
learned
judge
simply
didn't
do
his
homework.
a
reading
of
the
statute
shows,
beyond
question
of
doubt,
that
the
qualifications
are
almost
in
haec
verba
identical
and
certainly
in
substance.
there
is
no
difference
between
them.
the
second
reason
is
a
more
interesting
one.
he
starts
with
the
premise
that,
under
the
1951
amendment,
employees
who
are
covered
by
a
union-shop
agreement
were
granted
by
congress
the
right
to
join
any
other
union,
that
is
to
say,
other
than
the
contracting
union,
which
they
--
the
employees
believe
to
qualify.
then,
the
judge
went
on
to
point
out
that
the
section
3
procedure,
being
available
only
to
unions,
not
to
employees,
concluded
that
he
must
have
his
right,
that
is,
the
individual
employee,
himself
to
prove
subsequently
that,
previously,
he
believed
to
be
the
fact.
now,
let
me
make
that
more
exquisite.
the
critical
aspect
of
the
decision
below
is
that
employees
may,
first,
join
unions
and,
subsequently,
in
a
court
of
law,
prove
that
the
unions
they
joined
met
the
requirements
of
the
1951
amendment.
now,
to
please
the
court,
it
seems
to
me
that
any
rule
of
law
--
mr.
henry
kaiser
exactly.
mr.
henry
kaiser
exactly.
i
say
that
any
rule
of
law
that,
in
one
breath,
says
that
parties
may
enter
into
a
lawful
agreement
and,
in
the
second,
precludes
those
parties
from
knowing
the
terms
of
their
own
agreement
from
confidently
performing
their
own
obligation,
from
mutually
agrees
on
the
meaning
and
scope
of
their
own
agreement,
i
say
that
reflects
an
internal
contradiction
that's
completely
insupportable
no
matter
what
the
subject
matter
of
the
agreement
or
how
privately
limited
its
impact.
now,
how
much
greater
is
that
contradiction
when
we're
dealing
with
an
agreement
authorized
by
the
congress
covering
labor
relations
in
an
industry
whose
welfare,
whose
labor
peace
is
so
vital
to
the
nation's
welfare.
the
statute,
in
its
declaration
of
purposes
and
in
its
substantive
provisions,
exhorts
and
mandates
the
parties
to
minimize
their
differences
and
resolve
their
disputes
by
the
most
informal
and
expeditious
methods
possible,
notably,
conferences
and
direct
negotiations.
this
court,
in
the
leading
virginia
case,
said,
“the
major
objective
of
the
statute
is
the
avoidance
of
industrial
strife
by
conference
between
the
authorized
representative,
but
of
what
avail,
what
utility,
a
conference
by
the
parties
who
are
handicapped
by
a
coerced
ignorance
as
to
the
meaning
of
their
union-shop
agreement,
and
how
a
void
industrial
strife
if
the
normal
self-interest
of
the
parties
to
the
agreement
compels
conflict.”
now,
let's
picture
the
realistic
situation.
brotherhood
here
has
a
contrast
with
a
carrier.
brotherhood
says
to
the
carrier,
“mr.
rychlik,
respondent
here,
is
not
a
member
of
our
union.
he's
not
a
member
of
another
union,
national
in
scope.
we,
therefore
--
we,
therefore,
request
you
to
comply
with
your
commitment
and
discharge
mr.
rychlik.”
now,
if
the
opinion
below
is
affirmed,
the
carrier,
at
an
understandable
interest
to
prevent
the
incurrence
of
liability,
would
say,
“we
cannot
discharge
mr.
rychlik
until
we
get
some
court
determination
that
uroc
is
not
national
in
scope.”
the
union
would
say,
“very
well.
we
insist
upon
you
discharging
him
because
no
court
has
as
yet
said
that
uroc
is
national
in
scope.”
in
short,
gentlemen,
the
necessary
inevitable
result
of
the
decision
below
is
to
invite
industrial
strife
rather
than
to
avoid
it.
it
is
unthinkable.
it
is
unthinkable
that
the
congress
created
a
right
in
these
individuals,
employees,
as
defined
by
the
court
below.
now,
what
did
congress
have
in
mind?
congress,
we
say,
left
to
the
individuals,
and
i
underscore
the
word
“left”
because
the
1951
amendment
granted
to
employees
nothing.
it
diluted
preexisting
rights.
mr.
henry
kaiser
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
kaiser
absolutely,
could
of
--
could
of
--
mr.
henry
kaiser
nothing
in
statute
--
mr.
henry
kaiser
nothing
in
the
statute
or
in
the
agreement
would
prevent
any
employee
from
joining
any
other
union
so
long
as
he
tendered
his
dues
to
the
contracting
union.
mr.
henry
kaiser
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
kaiser
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
henry
kaiser
that's
right.
mr.
henry
kaiser
well,
i
--
mr.
henry
kaiser
i
think
--
i
think
--
mr.
henry
kaiser
yes.
mr.
henry
kaiser
well
--
mr.
henry
kaiser
i'm
afraid,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
i
have
not
made
myself
clear.
mr.
henry
kaiser
the
justice
--
mr.
henry
kaiser
judge
hand's
--
judge
hand
read
the
1951
amendment
as
conferring,
i
think
he
used
the
word
"granted,”
to
employees
the
right
to
join
another
labor
organization
in
the
face
of
a
union-shop
agreement
that
is,
and
i'm
quoting
the
judge
now,
“in
fact
national
in
scope.”
the
necessary
implication
of
his
holding
and
reasoning
is,
at
that
critical
fact,
is
subject
to
subsequent
authoritative
determination,
either
administratively
or
judicially,
for
the
months
he
is
unemployed.
once
he
reaches
that
conclusion
as
to
the
right
granted
in
1951,
he
goes
on
to
point
out
that
though
the
section
3
procedure
is
admittedly
impartial,
it's
not
available
to
the
affected
employee.
he
also
goes
on
to
say
that
the
system
board
structure
is
so
inherently
biased
as
to
preclude
a
discretion
of
evaluation
of
the
employee's
association,
so
he's
left
only
with
the
courts,
and
suggests
that,
absent
some
effective
tribunal
for
resolving
that
question,
constitutional
issues
are
raised.
that,
as
i
understand
it,
is
the
reason
of
the
court
below.
mr.
henry
kaiser
and,
i
suggest
that
the
basic
error
of
that
reasoning
is
the
insupportability
of
the
right
he
believed
was
granted
in
1951.
mr.
henry
kaiser
i
--
mr.
henry
kaiser
and
what
i
--
mr.
henry
kaiser
well
--
mr.
henry
kaiser
well,
that
was
--
mr.
henry
kaiser
that
--
yes.
mr.
henry
kaiser
well,
unless
he
--
mr.
henry
kaiser
and
--
and
that
--
mr.
henry
kaiser
--
and
that
is
the
thesis
that
mr.
clattenburg
was
trying
to
urge
upon
you.
now,
i
would
go
one
step
further,
if
it
please
the
court.
i
would
say
that
a
reading
of
the
amendment
to
--
granting
to
the
employees
the
right,
subsequently,
to
go
to
system
board
results
in
chaos
that
totally
confounds
the
whole
scheme
of
the
statute,
and
i
am
saying
--
mr.
henry
kaiser
--
that
--
mr.
henry
kaiser
--
what
--
mr.
henry
kaiser
absolutely
not.
i
agree
with
that.
but,
i'd
like
to
go
to
what
i
regard
to
be
the
--
the
essential
aspect
of
the
case.
we
say
that
congress
intended
and
only
could
have
intended
the
remainder
of
this
right
in
railroad
employees,
namely,
that
they
could
join
an
alternate
union
that
had
already
been
authoritatively
and
definitively
found
to
be
national
in
scope
and
--
mr.
henry
kaiser
by
the
section
3
proceeding.
mr.
henry
kaiser
well,
that
--
mr.
henry
kaiser
that
is
certainly
not
right.
i
say,
with
all
respect
--
mr.
henry
kaiser
not
at
all.
mr.
henry
kaiser
i'd
be
glad
to.
mr.
henry
kaiser
it
certainly
is.
mr.
henry
kaiser
section
3
allows
any
union
that
is
national
in
scope
to
prove
its
case
before
a
totally
impartial
tribunal
that
it
is
national
in
scope
and
otherwise
organized
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
act.
there
is
nothing
in
the
1951
amendment
that,
in
any
way,
insulates,
cuts
down,
in
any
way
prevents
any
new
union
from
being
declared
national
in
scope
and
enjoying
the
exemption
of
the
1951
amendment.
mr.
henry
kaiser
by
going,
in
the
first
instance,
to
the
qualified
unions
themselves,
and
it's
own
--
mr.
henry
kaiser
exactly.
and
so
we
--
mr.
henry
kaiser
because
the
statute
takes
care
of
that.
mr.
henry
kaiser
the
statute
says
that,
where
those
already
qualified
resist
the
request,
and
all
you
need
is
a
request
and
a
name,
then,
the
statute
says
you
go
to
the
secretary
of
labor.
and,
if
the
secretary
of
labor
finds
any
merit
in
your
application,
it
is
transferred
over
to
a
three-man
board
that
is
totally
impartial
in
a
sense
that
one
of
the
men
on
the
board
is
a
representative
of
those
already
qualified,
a
second
man
is
the
designee
of
the
applicant,
and
the
third
is
a
neutral
selected
by
the
national
mediation
board.
mr.
henry
kaiser
oh,
no.
mr.
henry
kaiser
i
most
certainly
would
not.
mr.
henry
kaiser
i
have
engaged
--
i
have
--
mr.
henry
kaiser
i
would
not.
i
have
engaged
--
mr.
henry
kaiser
--
in
countless
arbitration
procedures
where
one
man
was
designated
by
one
contestant,
the
second
by
the
other
contestant,
and
a
third
was
a
neutral,
and
nobody
has
ever
suggested
throughout
these
proceedings,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
the
three-man
procedure
or
the
entire
procedure
of
section
3
was,
in
any
way,
biased
or
partial.
mr.
henry
kaiser
i'm
afraid
not.
mr.
henry
kaiser
well
--
i
think,
if
i
may
say
so,
that
where,
more
significantly,
we
have
so
far
not
come
to
grips,
is
the
--
mr.
henry
kaiser
exactly.
and,
what's
more,
plotted
in
terms
of
the
--
of
the
statute,
its
objectives,
its
language
is
not
the
quality,
the
bias
or
the
unbiased,
the
partiality
or
impartiality
of
the
appropriate
tribunal
to
resolve
this
question
but
when
this
question
is
to
be
resolved.
and,
i
say
that
the
right
granted
by
the
congress
--
excuse
me,
the
right
left
by
the
congress
to
employees,
only
to
operating
employee,
under
the
1951
amendment
was
the
right
to
join
a
union
already
so
qualified
by
whatever
appropriate
tribunal.
i
say
that
if
my
premise
be
adopted,
we
don't
get
to
the
question
of
where
it
is
done.
mr.
henry
kaiser
well,
where
--
where
the
steele
case
does
not
apply
to
my
approach,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
is
the
holing
in
the
steele
case
by
this
court
that
these
negro
employees
had
a
right,
the
right
to
be
treated
fairly
by
their
statutory
representative.
mr.
henry
kaiser
that's
the
hope.
that's
the
substantive
right
for
which
the
court,
this
court,
provided
a
form
for
its
vindication
in
the
court.
now,
here,
i'm
saying
that
no
right
under
the
statute,
either
under
its
expressed
provision
or
under
any
possible
interpretation
by
this
court
is
involved
in
this
case
because
it
is
not
alleged,
it
is
not
suggested
that
this
uroc
has
been
qualified
in
the
past.
mr.
henry
kaiser
i
respectfully
disagree
with
you.
mr.
henry
kaiser
i
say
to
you,
we
don't
get
to
the
issue
of
remedy
of
forum
until
we
determine
what
rights
we
are
vindicating,
and
i
say
to
you
and
urge
upon
you
that
this
court
must,
consistent
with
every
sentence
of
the
railway
labor
act,
and
consistent
with
every
utterance
of
this
court,
and
consistent
with
elemental
common
sense
must
find
that
the
right
of
employees,
under
a
union-shop
amendment,
is
the
right
to
join
an
alternate
union
that
has
been
qualified
authoritatively.
and,
i
say
that
once
you
agree
with
the
need
of
that
construction,
which
in
no
way
is
inconsistent
with
the
language
of
the
1951
amendment,
then,
i
say
the
question
of
forum
automatically
dissipates
itself.
no
union
could
come
to
the
court
and
say,
"please
declare
me
national
in
scope."
you
wouldn't
have
a
justiciable
issue.
mr.
henry
kaiser
no.
mr.
henry
kaiser
no.
i
deny
that,
yes.
mr.
henry
kaiser
it's
--
it's
a
different
case.
the
only
--
the
only
thing
that
i
could
suggest
--
suggest
by
way
of
section
3,
that
is,
the
procedure
for
determining
selectors
to
the
board,
might
come
to
the
court,
might,
as
a
part
of
demonstration
that
the
secretary
of
labor,
let
us
say,
is
not
performing
his
ministerial
duty,
which
is
the
point
--
mr.
henry
kaiser
no,
i'm
not.
mr.
henry
kaiser
no.
you
asked
me
--
mr.
henry
kaiser
--
how
you
get
to
the
court.
mr.
henry
kaiser
exactly.
mr.
henry
kaiser
exactly,
that
there
is
no
cause
of
action
stated
here
because
it
has
not
been
alleged
and
it
is
not
a
fact
that,
at
the
time
that
respondent
joined
uroc,
that
uroc
had
been
authoritatively
--
mr.
henry
kaiser
i'm
glad
to
hear
i
don't
have
to.
mr.
henry
kaiser
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
devote
what
free
time
i
have
first
to
disabuse
you
of
any
misimpression
that
may
have
been
left
from
remarks
just
made.
the
appendix
to
the
brief
we
are
told
was
put
in
to
show
how
complete
the
control
is
of
those
unions
already
qualified
over
the
situation
on
how
they
can
exploit
that
monopoly
by
preventing
new
unions
achieving
the
same
status.
this
was
never
suggested
below.
it's
not
part
of
the
proof,
not
part
of
their
argument
below.
it's
of
no
way
involved
in
judge
hand's
opinion.
we
have
it
for
the
first
time
in
appendix
to
the
brief.
and
what
does
that
appendix
show?
i
read
now
from
page
26
a
decision
of
the
secretary
of
labor
whose
functions
are
not
the
complete
one
suggested
here
he
performs
an
intermediary
function.
if
and
when
the
qualifying
unions
do
not
accept
a
new
union's
claim
to
be
“national
in
scope,”
then
the
new
union
has
immediate
access
to
the
secretary
of
labor
who
makes
a
prima
facie
finding
sufficient
to
send
that
on
to
a
three
men
board
which
must,
under
the
statute
make
its
determination
within
30
days.
now
what
does
the
secretary
of
labor
said
about
the
need
of
the
qualifying
unions
to
certify,
to
certify
a
dispute?
i
read
now
from
page
26
--
mr.
henry
kaiser
of
the
appendix
--
respondent's
appendix
to
their
brief.
in
the
determination
of
the
claim
of
the
brotherhood
etcetera,
the
secretary
of
labor
considered
a
situation
similar
to
this
and
expressed
the
opinion
in
which
i
concur
that
the
word
dispute
as
used
in
the
act
was
not
to
be
so
narrowly
construed
as
to
make
it
possible
for
the
participating
agencies
effectively
to
prevent
more
organization
from
participating
merely
by
refraining
from
any
action
on
application
for
admissions.
now
what
actually
happened
in
this
case,
if
your
honors
please,
it
was
not
until
may
of
1955
--
may
of
1955
that
any
approach
was
made
to
the
qualifying
unions
saying,
“we
believe
we
are
national
in
scope
and
are
entitled
to
that
status.”
we've
also
heard
a
statement
here
that
can
only
be
describe
as
fabulously
incredible.
the
statement
that
new
unions
under
this
field
have
a
disability
nowhere
else
present.
the
obvious
truth
is
that
because
of
the
purposes
of
subsection
(c)
granting
this
exemption
from
the
requirement
to
belong
to
a
union
shop
gives
to
new
unions
in
this
field
a
latitude
no
where
enjoyed
throughout
the
country
or
throughout
our
trade
union
history.
all
a
new
union
need
do
and
it's
only
limited
to
the
operating
brotherhood
is
to
go
through
this
easy
three
first
(f)
procedure.
it
may
not
even
require
an
ultimate
determination
by
a
board.
it
can
and
has
been
achieved
by
a
simple
request
of
the
qualified
union.
but
all
they
have
to
do
is
be
“national
in
scope”
and
they
can
come
to
employees
under
a
union
shop
agreement
and
say
to
those
employees,
“you
need
not
even
pay
dues
to
the
contracting
union,
pay
it
to
us
and
your
job
is
protected.”
now
that's
unheard
of
in
trade
union
history.
they
enjoy,
i
repeat,
a
right
to
compete
nowhere
else
existed.
now
finally
if
i
may
because
i
think
this
is
so
important,
i
should
like
to
come
to
grips
with
some
of
the
questions
put
to
me
yesterday.
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
judge
hand
made
two
important
decisions
that
a
potential
of
infinite
mischief.
one
was
that
by
the
very
structure
of
these
system
boards,
there
is
a
legally
implied
bias
that
renders
inconclusive
and
in
subject
to
review
any
decision
that
that
board
would
make
where
the
position
of
the
union
is
in
any
way
in
conflict
with
one
of
those
that
the
union
represents.
now
that
was
the
point
to
which
mr.
clattenburg
addressed
his
remarks.
that
would
mean
that
many
instances
are
no
way
related
to
union
shop.
paid
claims,
seniority,
and
whatnot
would
be
resolved
ultimately
in
the
courts.
and
that
we
say
clearly
is
completely
in
conflict
with
the
long
lines
--
long
line
of
decisions
of
this
court
and
with
the
framework
and
design
of
the
statute.
mr.
henry
kaiser
that's
right.
mr.
henry
kaiser
yes.
mr.
henry
kaiser
i'm
not
sure
i
--
i
understood
the
full
--
mr.
henry
kaiser
--
implications
of
your
remark.
mr.
henry
kaiser
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
kaiser
that's
right.
mr.
henry
kaiser
well,
all
i
can
say
to
that
--
mr.
henry
kaiser
all
i
can
say
to
that
mr.
justice
brennan
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter
is
that
if
that
be
so
and
we
categorically
deny
it,
if
that
be
so,
and
then
the
whole
scheme
of
the
statute
is
destroyed.
now,
degrees
of
hostility
are
--
are
very
subtle
evasive
psychiatric
phenomenon.
mr.
henry
kaiser
well
--
mr.
henry
kaiser
that
always
maybe
so
mr.
justice
brennan
in
any
situation
or
maybe
personal
hostility
or
personal
interest
--
mr.
henry
kaiser
on
the
part
of
the
judge
that
would
walk
his
judicious
decisions.
and
i
say
upon
a
demonstration
of
that
degree
of
hostility
effecting
his
judgment
upon
an
allegation
and
proof
of
that.
we
agree
in
our
briefs
and
elsewhere
that
there
ought
to
be
at
least
that
degree
of
scrutiny
in
the
reviewing
--
in
a
reviewing
court.
but
i
must
if
i
may
get
to
the
next
point
which
i
think
is
critical
here.
i
want
to
try
to
have
you
understand
that
under
our
position
which
is
eminently
fed
to
the
employee,
to
the
contracting
union,
to
the
carrier
and
to
the
ultimate,
the
outside
union,
the
second
part
of
his
decision
in
no
way
relates
to
bias.
the
second
part
of
his
decision
makes
sense
in
terms
of
his
premise,
his
premise
is
--
his
premise
is
that
subsection
(c)
gave
to
the
individual
employee
a
right
himself
to
prove
the
qualifications
of
the
ultimate
union
after
he
has
joined
the
ultimate
union.
now
what
does
that
mean
in
terms
of
the
individual
employee?
are
we
to
assign
to
congress
an
intention
to
say
to
railroad
employees,
“join
this
union.
we
let
you
do
this.”
what
we
--
it's
an
awful
gamble
if
you're
wrong
subsequently
and
it
makes
no
difference,
if
the
court
please,
whether
that
subsequent
wrong
is
determined
by
a
court,
by
a
system
board
or
by
the
3
(f)
board.
that
employee
has
the
burden
imposed
upon
him
of
taking
a
frightful
gamble
and
then
the
further
burden
of
proving
facts
or
proving
a
concept
that
is
quite
nebulous
with
facts
that
he
doesn't
posses.
the
employee
doesn't
know
the
extent
of
organization,
the
number
of
contracts
the
union
has,
what
his
purposes
are,
what
every
might
be
subsumed
within
this
elastic
evasive
concept.
it
imposes
on
this
employee
an
intolerable
burden.
moreover,
it
invites
conflict
between
the
carrier
and
the
union.
the
whole
thrust
of
the
act
is
to
stay
away
from
all
boards.
let's
negotiate
our
differences.
the
act
says,
“sit
down
and
work
it
out
by
conference.”
well,
you
can't
work
it
out
because
nobody
has
determined
as
yet
whether
this
union
is
“national
in
scope.”
and
we
say
that
--
what
congress
said
and
it's
totally
consistent
with
statutory
language.
and
let
me
--
very
briefly
to
the
juries'
use
of
the
definite
article
in
subsection
(c),
it
says
as
to
operating
employees,
the
requirement
of
union
membership
shall
not
impose
somewhat
apply
to
any
employee
who
holds
or
acquires
membership
in
any
one
of
the
labor
organizations
organized
--
“national
in
scope”
and
organized,
etcetera.
now
the
(inaudible)
is
very
clumsy
if
it
doesn't
mean
anything.
it
could
have
said
in
any
labor
organization
organized
“national
in
scope”
and
organized
in
accordance
with
the
provision
of
the
act.
they
said
the
--
they
used
a
definite
article
to
serve
its
grammatical
function
of
identifying
known
phenomenon,
unions
that
are
already
declared
“national
in
scope.”
and
it
makes
no
sense
in
any
other
way.
and
if
this
court
abstains
from
ruling
on
this
critical
point,
either
way,
then
the
confusion
that
has
been
around
us
since
1951
will
continue
and
i
say
it's
unfair
to
the
employee
and
unfair
to
the
outside
union
and
unfair
to
the
carriers
and
unfair
to
the
contracting
unions,
and
hence
--
and
hence,
unfair
to
the
public
who
are
the
real
beneficiaries
of
this
statute.
thank
you
very
much.
