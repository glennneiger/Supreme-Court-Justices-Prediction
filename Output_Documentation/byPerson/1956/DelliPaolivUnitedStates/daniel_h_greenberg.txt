mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
court
is
granted
certiorari
in
a
criminal
case
from
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals.
once
again,
we
are
confronted
with
the
problem
to
the
law
of
conspiracy,
a
federal
criminal
conspiracy.
the
petitioner,
orlando
delli
paoli,
and
somewhere
along
the
line,
his
name
was
shorten
by
certain
references
to
the
--
to
paoli
but
his
last
name
is
delli
paoli,
it's
a
double
name.
he
was
indicted
together
with
four
codefendants
on
a
charge
as
to
him
of
conspiracy
to
violate
the
alcohol
tax
laws.
two
of
the
codefendants
were
charged
in
substantive
counts,
alleging
possession
or
purchasing
transportation
of
illicit
alcohol.
the
facts
of
the
case
show
that
commencing
in
december
1949,
the
activities
of
the
defendants
with
the
exemption
of
the
defendants
king
and
whitley
who
were
determined
only
to
be
purchases
of
illicit
alcohol,
the
activities
of
the
other
three
defendants,
namely,
delli
paoli,
a
man
named
pierro,
and
another
man
named
margiasso,
were
under
surveillance
by
agents
of
the
alcohol
tax
unit.
the
evidence
in
the
record
discloses
that
over
two-year
period,
the
activities
of
these
defendants
were
under
intermittent
observation
by
the
agents.
now,
actually,
i've
gone
to
through
the
record
and
i've
counted
10
specific
dates
under
which
the
activities
of
these
men
were
being
observed.
it
was
a
surreptitious
observation
in
the
type
that
it
is
to
be
expected
when
a
case
of
this
kind
is
being
made.
the
facts
disclosed
that
pierro
purchased
a
house
in
the
section
of
the
bronx,
new
york,
in
the
name
of
his
sister.
first,
he
went
to
look
at
this
house
and
that
his
two
close
friends,
delli
paoli
and
margiasso,
who
were
his
constant
companions
went
with
him,
they
looked
at
the
house,
they
discussed
it
with
the
owner,
although,
there's
nothing
to
show
that
anyone
except
pierro
ever
had
any
of
the
negotiations
for
the
purchase
of
the
house
or
ever
participated,
and
at
least,
delli
paoli
did
not
participate
in
negotiations.
they
saw
this
house
and
had
a
garage
next
to
it,
and
subsequently,
the
house
was
purchased.
and
then,
intermittently,
during
the
next
year
and
a
half,
the
house
was
purchased
in
the
spring
of
1950.
the
agents
would,
at
no
particular
time,
come
around
and
watch
these
people,
watch
their
comings
and
goings.
they
observed
that
the
repairs
were
made
to
the
garage
there.
that
glass
windows
were
taken
out
of
the
doors
and
substituted
with
blank
wooden
boards.
they
observed
that
they
bought
some
trucks
and
that
the
trucks
were
painted,
and
subsequently,
it
was
determined
on
the
trial
that
these
trucks
were
registered
in
fictitious
names.
at
various
times,
it
was
observed
that
these
people
had
meetings
at
various
places.
nothing
conclusive
was
ever
established
about
any
of
these
meetings
or
about
any
of
these
comings
and
goings
by
these
different
people.
finally,
in
the
fall
of
1951,
the
surveillance
became
intensified
and
we
have
testimony
of
an
increase
in
activity.
all
neighbors
also
testify
that
the
--
they
heard
activity
at
night
in
the
vicinity
of
this
house
and
--
and
truck.
i
will
say
that
a
woman
who
lived
at
the
house
was
introduced
to
a
neighbor
who
testified
on
the
trial
as
a
cousin
of
delli
paoli.
a
relative
of
pierro
has
also
lived
at
this
house
after
some
time.
i
will
say
that
all
of
this
evidence
that
went
before
the
jury
is
laying
a
foundation
for
what
ultimately
happened
on
december
28,
1951.
now,
starting
with
about
the
fourth
day
of
december,
i'm
going
to
advert,
for
a
moment
or
two,
to
some
of
the
kind
of
observation
which
were
held
in
this
case.
and
all
of
this,
to
me,
is
important
because
it
has
background
for
what
ultimately
developed
on
the
trial.
on
december
4,
1951,
agent
silvers
of
the
alcohol
tax
unit
testified
to
the
effect
that
he
was
observing
the
garage.
the
garage
were
ultimately
153
cans
of
illicit
alcohol
was
found
and
as
delli
paoli
came
to
the
garage
and
opened
the
doors,
and
this
was
in
broad
daylight,
at
that
precise
moment,
the
agent
seized
these
observations
and
left
the
scene.
no
reason
was
attributed
for
why
this
course
of
conduct
in
the
part
of
the
agent
happened
but
he
was
looking
into
the
garage,
ostensibly,
he
saw
nothing
because
he
related
nothing
as
to
what
happened
once
the
garage
doors
were
opened
and
then
immediately,
he
departed
the
scene.
on
december
18th,
at
the
other
important
location
in
this
case,
a
service
station
which
the
government
characterizes
as
a
"switch
point"
for
the
transfer
of
the
illicit
alcohol
which
was
being
delivered
to
the
purchases
that
a
--
a
car
which
is
characterized
as
being
heavily
laden
was
driven
away
by
two
unknown
men.
i
suppose
the
inferences
that
this
car
contained
illicit
alcohol,
but
we
will
never
know
because
the
car
was
never
apprehended
and
is
never
stopped,
this
is
some
sort
of
the
type
of
evidence
which
went
before
this
jury
during
a
trial
which
lasted
eight
full
trial
days.
finally,
we
come
--
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
thank
you,
sir.
i
was
at
the
point
in
the
--
in
detailing
the
advancement
of
this
case
and
i
will
turn
now
to
the
last
day,
the
day
on
which
alcohol
was
discovered
at
the
garage
and
the
day
on
which
all
of
the
defendants
were
apprehended.
this
day,
december
28,
1951,
the
facts
as
proven
by
the
government's
agents,
and
i
might
say
at
this
point
that
all
of
the
evidence
was
introduced
by
the
government,
either
through
government
agents
or
the
testimony
of
witnesses.
and
other
than
by
cross-examination,
the
defendants
offered
no
direct
proof.
on
december
28,
the
defendant,
margiasso
and
king,
met
at
the
service
station,
the
bruckner
boulevard
service
station.
and
there,
margiasso
took
king's
car
and
went
away.
king
remained
there
and
after
a
little
while,
delli
paoli
showed
up
and
his
car
was
placed
on
the
greasing
rack
and
while
his
car
was
being
serviced,
he
and
king
engaged
in
conversation.
all
of
this
was
observed
by
government
agents
observing
this
gas
station
through
field
glasses
from
some
distance
away.
after
--
after
delli
paoli's
car
was
finished
being
serviced,
it
was
taken
off
the
rack
and
thereafter,
the
two
men
continued
to
be
with
each
other
until
margiasso
returned.
and
at
that
moment,
king
got
into
his
car
and
drove
away
and
he
drove
from
this
point
in
the
east
bronx
down
to
harlem
where
he
was
apprehended
by
the
agents.
they
followed
him
from
the
service
station
and
a
number
of
cans
of
--
of
bootleg
were
found
in
the
car.
nothing
further
was
observed
during
--
and
this
was
in
the
early
part
of
the
evening.
nothing
further
was
observed
until
margiasso
was
seen
to
come
back
to
the
service
station
at
about
10
o'clock.
delli
paoli's
whereabouts
were
not
known
and
the
agents
watched
margiasso,
and
pretty
soon,
whitley
showed
up.
now,
whitley
came
to
the
service
station.
margiasso
got
out
of
his
car
and
went
into
whitley's
car
and
drove
it
away
and
drove
to
this
--
to
this
garage
at
harding
park,
the
house
location.
and
there,
margiasso
was
observed
to
open
the
garage
doors,
but
evidently,
something
alerted
him
because
leaving
the
garage
doors
open,
he
got
back
into
whitley's
car
and
started
to
drive
away
when
the
agents
seized
him.
and
on
this
person,
they
found
keys
which
fitted
the
lock
of
this
--
of
the
garage.
they
went
back
to
the
garage.
the
doors
were
open
and
located
inside
the
garage
were
153
five-gallon
cans
of
alcohol.
they
took
margiasso
back
to
the
service
station
where
whitley
was
found
and
he
had
a
brown
paper
bag
with
a
thousand
dollars
in
cash
in
--
inside
the
bag
and
these
men
were
arrested.
and
as
the
agents
started
to
leave,
delli
paoli
started
to
drive
into
the
service
station.
one
of
the
agents,
a
man
named
fay,
engaged
delli
paoli
in
conversation
and
after
a
few
moments,
delli
paoli
started
to
back
out
of
the
service
station.
and
as
he
did
so,
a
car
was
brought
up
alongside
of
him
and
then
a
police
car
came
in
behind
them
and
so
he
was
prevented
from
backing
out
of
the
service
station.
the
reason
i
detail
those
facts
is
because
the
government
has
claimed
that
this
was
an
attempt
to
flee
on
the
part
of
delli
paoli,
which
would
be
evidence
of
consciousness
of
guilt.
agent
fay,
the
man
who
engaged
delli
paoli
in
conversation
was
never
called
as
a
witness
nor
was
his
absence
unexplained.
the
only
evidence
we
have
as
to
the
kind
of
conversation
was
agent
(inaudible)
characterization
that
they
appeared
to
be
having
some
sort
of
an
argument,
that
is,
fay
and
delli
paoli.
but
what
was
said,
we
don't
know.
the
government
claimed
in
the
court
below
that
this
was
attempted
escape,
which
could
properly
be
considered
by
the
jury.
i
countered
that
--
that
there
was
no
such
thing.
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
said
nothing
about
it,
they
ignored
the
point.
and
judge
frank
in
dissent
said
that
it's
hardly
evidence
of
escape.
they
pressed
the
point
here
too.
there's
nothing
to
show
that
delli
paoli
knew
he
was
being
interrogated
or
being
apprehended
by
a
government
agent
or
by
any
other
police
officer.
you
have
the
same
sort
of
situation
as
this
court
passed
upon
in
the
di
re
case
where
a
--
where
we
had
an
arrest
of
a
man
who
was
subsequently
found
to
have
illicit
ration
--
gasoline
ration
stamps
on
this
person
who
did
not
protest
his
arrest.
and
in
this
case,
we
don't
know
what
the
conversation
between
the
two
persons
was.
we
don't
know
what
prompted
delli
paoli
to
back
out
at
the
service
station
because
the
record
is
completely
barren
in
all
of
these
facts.
now,
after
--
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
a
relative
of
his
lived
there
for
some
time.
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
no,
sir.
pierro,
the
--
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
--
third
man
bought
it
for
his
sister,
mrs.
stacio,
and
a
mrs.
destefano,
a
cousin
of
delli
paoli
lived
there.
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
no,
he
never
lived.
he
lived
in
the
neighborhood
and
everything
here
happened
within
the
radius
of
--
of
a
few
blocks
of
where
pierro
lived,
margiasso
lived
and
delli
paoli
livee,
and
where
the
service
station
was
also
located.
i
doubt
that
the
distance
between
any
of
these
places
was
more
than
a
mile.
although
at
the
place
where
king
was
apprehended
in
harlem
was
more
than
six
miles
away
through
some
of
the
most
heavily
traffic
streets
of
the
city
of
new
york.
now,
five
days
after
these
men
were
apprehended,
and
it's
conceded
by
all
that
the
conspiracy
terminated
with
the
arrest
of
these
defendants,
whitley
accompanied
by
his
lawyer,
went
to
the
offices
of
the
alcohol
tax
unit
and
there,
he
executed
a
detailed
confession,
which
is
printed
as
an
appendix
to
judge
frank's
dissenting
opinion,
which
is
printed
as
an
appendix
to
the
petitioner's
brief
in
this
case.
and
this
confession,
if
your
honors
would
read
it,
would
observe,
spells
out
quite
in
some
detail
the
government's
theory
of
this
case
that
is
the
long-range
conspiracy
culminating
in
the
events
of
the
final
night
and
approximately
two
of
the
three
pages
are
dealt
with
particularity
with
the
details
of
the
alleged
criminal
conduct
of
delli
paoli
and
it
is
petitioner's
argument,
that
this
is
the
only
evidence
of
substance
in
the
case
against
them.
of
course,
when
it
was
received
in
evidence
on
the
trial
as
the
last
bit
of
proof
offered
by
the
government,
it
was
scrupulously
directed
to
the
jury
that
they
were
not
to
consider
it
as
evidence
against
anybody
but
the
confessor,
whitley.
it
was
not
evidence
against
any
of
the
other
persons
named
therein
and
was
not
to
be
considered
by
them.
of
course,
objection
was
made
to
the
offer
of
proof
of
this
confession.
suggestions
were
made
that
the
names
of
the
codefendants
on
trial
ought
to
be
deleted.
this
suggestion
was
rejected
and
the
jury
had
the
full
details
of
it
before
them.
it
was
read
to
them.
there's
no
mention
in
the
record
that
the
jury
had
it
in
the
jury
room
with
them
during
their
deliberations
but
being
quite
familiar
with
the
practices
in
the
southern
district,
i
can
say
that
they
most
likely
did
have
this
and
the
other
exhibits,
other
physical
documents
in
the
jury
room
with
them.
they
were
made
available
to
the
jury.
now,
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
turn
first
with
--
with
your
honor's
consent
to
the
second
point
of
my
brief
and
that
is
the
propriety
of
receiving
in
evidence
this
confession
by
whitley
and
its
use
in
adjudicating
the
guilt
of
the
petitioner
delli
paoli.
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
your
honor,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
was
not
the
trial
counsel.
my
knowledge
--
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
yes.
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
i
find
--
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
yes.
at
the
end
of
all
--
well,
let
me
say
that
at
the
beginning,
the
only
inference
made
at
any
point
in
the
trial
that
there
was
to
be
any
evidence
of
any
admissions
was
in
the
opening
statement
of
the
prosecutor
to
the
effect
that
whitley
admitted
that
he
bought
alcohol
from
delli
paoli,
and
that
appears
at
page
12
of
the
record
in
the
following
fashion.
i'll
read
one
sentence
before
it
and
this
in
the
prosecutor's
opening.
“just
of
that
moment,
the
defendant
delli
paoli
drove
into
the
gas
station
and
he
also
was
placed
under
arrest.
following
this,
the
defendant,
whitley,
admitted
that
on
this
evening
he
had
arranged
to
obtain
some
alcohol
from
delli
paoli
and
that
the
arrangement
was
that
margiasso
was
to
deliver
to
him
in
the
car
which
he
had
driven
to
this
location
on
bruckner
boulevard.
now
--
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
no,
sir.
no
motions
were
made
for
--
for
a
separate
trial.
the
case
was
trialed
three
years
after
these
defendants
were
apprehended.
no
motions
were
made
for
severance.
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
i
doubt
--
you
mean
whitley,
sir?
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
no.
whitley
was
represented
by
a
different
man
on
the
trial
than
at
the
time
he
made
the
confession.
he
--
a
man
named
adams
represented
him
when
he
went
to
the
alcohol
tax
unit
on
january
5th
and
it
was
defended
by
another
man
on
the
trial.
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
sir?
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
none
of
the
defendants
--
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
--
took
the
stand.
whitley
was
represented
by
a
man
named
farrara
on
the
trial.
now,
the
witness
greenberg
as
an
agent
greenberg,
william
greenberg,
who
is
a
lawyer,
testified
in
substance
that
he
is
an
agent
of
the
tax
unit
--
alcohol
tax
unit,
and
that
on
january
5,
whitley
appeared
with
his
lawyer
and
there
he
--
he
executed
this
document
and
then
that
it
was
offered
in
evidence
and
that
was
all
there
was
to
it.
it
was
the
last
bit
of
proof
in
the
case.
and
--
and
greenberg
was
the
last
witness.
until
that
--
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
objection
were
that
it
was
hearsay
as
to
him
that
it
violated
the
rule
in
krulewitch
of
this
court,
and
that
it
was
prejudicial
and
harmful,
and
that
it
should
not
be
received
in
evidence.
and
extensive
colloquy
in
court
and
in
chambers
ensued
and
there
they
adjoined
overnight
while
memoranda
was
submitted
to
the
trial
judge
as
to
the
effects
of
the
krulewitch
case
upon
the
propriety
of
receiving
this
confession
and
the
following
day,
the
court
received
it
with
admonitions
to
the
jury
not
to
consider
it
as
evidence
of
the
guilt
of
any
of
the
people
named
therein,
other
than
that
of
the
confessor.
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
no,
sir.
whitley
made
a
detailed
confession
in
january
5,
1952
and
then
pleaded
not
guilty
and
stood
trial
and
was
convicted
on
the
trial,
and
was
sentenced
on
the
trial
--
after
trial.
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
as
--
if
your
honor
pleases,
so
far
as
whitley's
attorney
goes,
he
didn't
know
that
his
man
had
made
a
confession
until
it
was
offered
in
evidence
on
the
trial.
no
one
knew
and
whitley
had
forgotten
about
it.
i
guess
the
level
of
his
education
was
not
very
high.
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
whitley
--
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
whitley
was
then
serving
another
sentence
and
the
punishments
were
as
follows.
whitley
received
one
year
in
addition
to
the
other
--
consecutive
to
another
sentence
he
was
then
serving.
king
received
three
years
on
count
one
and
one
year
on
count
three
to
run
concurrently.
margiasso
received
two
years
on
each
of
three
counts
to
run
currently.
pierro,
the
man
who
bought
the
house
and
whose
only
connection
with
the
conspiracy
was
that,
received
a
two-year
suspended
sentence
with
two
years
probation.
delli
paoli
received
two
years
imprisonment.
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
two,
which
he's
now
serving.
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
no,
sir.
but
--
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
not
in
my
time,
if
your
honor
please,
when
i
was
an
assistant
united
states
attorney,
we
--
sometimes,
we
try
them
expeditiously,
but
a
very
large
and
cumbersome
case,
sometime
not.
i
don't
think
this
was
a
large
and
cumbersome
case,
although
it
took
eight
days
to
try.
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
i
think
whitley
went
to
prison
between
the
time
of
--
he
was
apprehended
here
and
the
time
he
was
tried
in
the
other
case.
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
just
king.
king
and
whitley
were
the
purchases
of
the
illicit
alcohol
and
delli
paoli,
margiasso
and
pierro
were
charged
as
being
the
salesmen
--
the
salesmen.
now,
of
course,
this
court
in
krulewitch
laid
down
what
we
thought
was
a
--
a
rule
that
hearsay
statements
of
this
sort,
whether
oral
or
written,
ought
not
to
be
accepted
in
evidence.
and
it
comes
down
to
the
question
of
the
problem
of
the
ability
of
the
jury
to
follow
instructions
as
judge
jackson
said
in
krulewitch.
it's
an
unmitigated
fiction
to
believe
that
prejudicial
effects
can
be
overcome
by
instructions
to
jury.
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
it's
reprinted
at
length
if
--
if
the
court
--
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
--
frankfurter,
in
the
government's
brief.
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
he
repeated
his
admonition.
i
will
say
that
judge
dawson
was
most
scrupulous
in
his
instructions
and
i
think
he
--
he
felt
he
was
coming
within
the
limits
of
the
cases
decided
in
the
second
circuit
that
judge
hand
speaks
of
in
his
opinion
for
the
court.
he
--
page
34
and
35
are
places
where
--
where
judge
--
where
judge
dawson's
charge
to
the
jury
is
indicated
and
at
an
earlier
point,
his
instructions
at
the
time
that
this
confession
was
received
in
evidence
is
also
repeated.
the
petitioner
makes
no
--
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
no,
sir.
that
is
exactly
my
point.
that
--
that
if
anyone
could
have
protected
the
rights
of
the
defendants,
judge
dawson
did.
i
say
of
course,
that
it
was
error
to
receive
it
in
the
first
place,
unless,
there
was
excision
or
unless
under
the
circumstances,
a
separate
trial
as
to
whitley
was
ordered.
i
subscribe
to
judge
frank's
view
that
harmful
effects
cannot
be
undone
by
--
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
in
the
way
in
which
it
was
suggested
by
a
counsel
on
the
trial,
i
agree
with
your
honor,
it
would
not
have.
it
would
have
required
taking
out
large
parts
of
the
confession
itself.
as
to
the
other
parts
we
--
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
whether
it
would
have
destroyed
its
usefulness
to
which
the
government
was
entitled
as
a
document
to
be
used
against
whitley
only,
and
perhaps
the
price
that
ought
to
be
--
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
yes.
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
yes.
unless
of
course
--
in
other
cases
to
come
in
the
future,
some
form
of
excision
can
be
accomplished
and
it
was
also
my
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
that
had
been
a
practice
in
that
--
in
that
office
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
to
make
excisions
and
cover
up
portions
of
documents
which
were
improper
and
which
might
be
prejudicial
and
that
suggestion
was
not
accepted
in
this
case.
it
was
offered.
it
was
not
followed.
now
--
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
yes,
your
honor.
that's
one
of
my
quarrels
is
that
more
than
half
the
document
deals
with
delli
paoli's
conduct
rather
than
with
whitley's
conduct
and
i
say
that
the
government
had
a
very
real
purpose
in
--
in
offering
this
document
and
that
real
purpose
was
to
get
these
facts
of
--
of
delli
paoli's
alleged
criminal
conduct
before
the
jury
because
they
had
no
other
evidence
and
that
the
use
of
this
document
did
cross
the
line
of
demarcation,
which
this
court
laid
down
in
the
case
such
as
lutwak
where
only
one
item
of
--
of
hearsay
was
received
against
the
particular
defendant
or
even
in
the
case,
the
most
recent
case
on
which
the
government
relies
in
opper
were
taken
altogether
with
all
the
evidence.
it
was
found
that
the
--
that
the
statements
of
(inaudible)
the
co-defendant,
were
not
so
prejudicial
as
to
warrant
eliminating
from
evidence
who
are
reversing
a
conviction
which
had
a
firm
foundation
on
other
substantial
evidence.
we
don't
have
that
here.
we
have
here
a
situation
where
it
--
i
don't
think
it
has
the
evidence
against
delli
paoli,
in
this
case,
rises
even
to
the
level
of
circumstantial
evidence,
and
circumstantial
evidence
is
certainly
good
evidence.
it's
to
be
pointed
out
that
delli
paoli
was
not
charged
as
an
aide
or
an
abettor
as
well
he
might
have
been
had
he
in
fact
aided
and
abetted
in
the
commission
of
these
crimes
to
the
extent
contended
for
by
the
government.
it's
a
--
the
case
against
delli
paoli
was
a
very
weak
one.
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
excuse
me,
sir.
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
oh,
yes.
that
--
i
--
i
would
say
that
in
all
respects,
those
rights
were
adequately
protected
and
that
the
record
was
clean
insofar
--
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
yes.
yes,
i
say
so.
that's
what
--
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
i
suggest
that
that's
the
--
at
an
examination
of
the
--
of
the
evidence
will
show
that
that
is
not
so
and
--
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
i
say
there
was
not
enough
evidence
--
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
--
to
submit
the
case
to
the
jury.
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
i
would
say
in
answer
to
your
--
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
yes,
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
yes,
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
i
would
say
that
assuming
that
there
was
enough
other
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury,
the
admission
of
this
confession
--
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
--
turned
the
balance.
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
yes.
but
i
say
--
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
i
don't
concede
that
there
was
enough.
i
say
that
judge
erred
in
sending
it
to
the
jury
in
the
first
place.
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
yes,
sir.
that's
true.
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
yes.
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
i
think
--
i
don't
believe
you
would
have
to.
i
would
--
i
would
say
if
your
honor,
that
it's
sufficient
to
state
that
the
--
that
the
defendant's
rights
in
regard
to
taking
objection
were
adequately
protected
by
an
exception
on
the
record
and
i
don't
think
that's
a
question
here.
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
yes.
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
that's
--
that
is
true.
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
yes,
they
did
do
that.
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
i'm
sorry,
sir.
i
didn't
catch
the
end.
mr.
daniel
h.
greenberg
i
would
say
as
--
as
justice
holmes
once
said,
you'd
have
to
prick
out
the
cases
interstitially
and
go
--
go
to
them
one
by
one
based
upon
their
facts
that
you
cannot
make
a
hard
and
fast
rule
to
cover
every
situation.
but
that
this
is
one
case
where
the
balance
of
propriety
where
the
point
of
no
return
was
reached
and
passed
and
where
there
was
no
going
back
and
that
judge
hand's
placebo
theory
is
what
it
comes
down
to
be
a
bread
pill,
a
sort
of
a
fiction,
a
medicinal
lie
which
undermines
the
truly
more
relationship
between
a
court
and
jury
and
the
litigants
before
it.
thank
you.
