mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
regret
--
may
it
please
the
court.
i
regret
to
have
to
open
the
discussion
on
this
apprehension
here,
inadvertent
i'm
sure
but
the
whole
color
of
the
case
as
to
what
evidence
was
presented
to
the
jury
here.
independently
of
this
confession,
i
believe,
has
been
presented
with
one
very
important
omission
which
i
want
to
put
into
the
facts
and
then
get
on
with
my
argument.
as
i
understood
the
statement
and
perhaps
i
misunderstood
it.
on
the
three
crucial
times
when
the
pattern
of
this
conspiracy
was
demonstrated
and
evidenced
in
the
testimony
without
contradiction,
it
was
not
just
a
matter
of
mr.
delli
paoli
appearing
at
that
filling
station
after
a
transfer
had
been
made,
but
the
record
is
very
clear
that
the
pattern
was
invariable
each
time.
the
first
thing
that
would
happen
is
margiasso,
the
man
who
drove
the
cars,
would
appear
at
that
filling
station.
that
happened
each
time.
he
was
there
before
this
thing
happened
and
so
clearly
by
appointment
that
we
can't
rely
on
the
laws
of
chance
or
just
good
company
or
loneliness
to
account
for
each
of
the
three
instances.
on
december
18,
that
night,
on
december
28,
that
night,
and
then
later,
again,
the
same
pattern,
he
appeared
first.
he
conferred
with
margiasso.
they
were
seen
talking
by
the
agents.
then,
petitioner
would
either
leave
or
he
would
sit
around
with
a
man
characterized
as
the
buyer
and
margiasso
will
take
the
buyer's
car,
drive
to
the
garage,
and
we
have
little
doubt
as
to
his
filling
it
each
time
because
there
is
affirmative
testimony
that
each
time
that
car
was
returned
by
margiasso,
it
was
heavily
laid
and
the
back
was
down,
and
of
course
the
second
time
they
caught
the
car
and
it
was
found
to
contain
90
--
95
gallons
of
unstamped
alcohol.
and
the
third
time
of
course,
the
same
pattern,
petitioner
went
away
and
then
when
he
came
back
before
margiasso
should
return,
of
course,
margiasso
had
been
arrested,
but
the
petitioner
was
there.
now,
the
jury
was
not
apprised
by
that
clear
testimony
as
to
what
the
--
the
petitioner's
status
was
in
the
transaction,
but
it
was
very
clear
that
he
was
the
man
that
was
to
be
there
at
every
transfer,
whether
he
was
the
supervisor,
the
collecting
agent,
or
what,
but
he
was
there
each
time.
it
was
not
an
--
a
single
case
without
anything
in
the
whole
collocation
of
evidence
as
in
the
raid
where
he
happened
to
be
there
at
--
at
a
time
when
someone
else
entirely
was
being
arrested.
he
was
there
each
time
and
when
he
drove
up
that
last
time,
of
course,
margiasso
wasn't
there.
whitley
had
been
arrested
with
a
thousand
dollars
in
a
paper
bag,
and
we
shant
take
the
time
to
quarrel
as
to
whether
he
tried
to
escape
or
not
because
it's
very
clear.
he
tried
to
back
out
of
there
when
the
agents
talked
to
him.
and
he
would
have
made
good
his
escape
if
another
agent's
car
hadn't
blocked
him
off
and
if
a
police
--
police
cruiser
hadn't
come
up
to
the
side
so
much
for
that.
i
mention
this
in
such
detail
because
what
was
before
this
jury
told
that
jury
everything
with
uncontradicted
testimony
as
a
result
of
good,
high-class
investigative
work
over
a
long
period
of
time
by
the
alcohol
agents.
that
jury
had
before
it
every
detail
that
was
in
the
confession
except
the
one
additional
item
that
whitley
after
describing
that
process
which
had
been
fully
described
in
the
testimony
and
attested
on
three
of
these
patterned
occasions,
whitley
added
the
fact
that
petitioner
was
there
as
the
collecting
agent,
which
added
not
a
great
deal,
but
we're
not
here
arguing
a
case
on
the
theory
that
there
was
an
error
here
which
was
harmless.
we're
contending
that
under
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
as
under
the
statute
of
congress
before
that,
joint
trials
are
an
accepted
matter
of
procedure
and
the
courts
rely
on
those.
there
is
no
exception
in
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
taking
away
the
specific
discretion
of
the
trial
judge
to
prevent
abuses.
so
we
are
not
arguing
here
that
there
was
an
error
which
we
say
was
harmless.
we
are
arguing
here
that
there
was
no
error
in
admitting
a
confession.
it
was
properly
safeguarded
because
that
is
within
the
right
of
the
judge
under
the
rules
and
under
the
decisions.
i
want
to
quote
here
from
a
case
which
was
measurably
more
difficult
than
this
one.
the
opper
case,
in
which
there
was
serious
question
as
to
whether
a
person
accused
of
bribing
a
government
employee
had
actually
done
so,
and
in
that
case,
the
employee's
confession
hollifield
was
admitted.
mr.
justice
reed,
speaking
for
the
court,
in
answer
to
exactly
the
contention
that
is
here
made
said
this,
and
i
read.
â€œthe
trial
judge
here
made
clear
and
repeated
admonitions
to
the
jury
at
appropriate
times
that
hollifield's
incriminatory
statements
were
not
to
be
considered
in
establishing
the
guilt
of
the
petitioner
to
say
that
the
jury
might
have
been
confused
amounts
to
nothing
more
than
an
unfounded
speculation
that
the
jurors
disregarded
clear
instructions
of
the
court
in
arriving
at
their
verdict."
our
theory
of
trial
relies
upon
the
ability
of
a
jury
to
follow
instructions.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
call
for
reversal
because
of
any
confusion
or
injustice
arising
from
the
joint
trial.
now
this
disposition
of
exactly
the
contention
here
in
a
much
worse
case
is
--
was
nothing
new.
in
lutwak,
the
court
made
the
same
disposition
despite
the
greater
seriousness
of
that
case
as
attested
in
the
dissent
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
mr.
justice
jackson,
which
pointed
out
that
in
that
case,
there
was
not
just
as
in
this
case
one
single
confession
to
be
kept
from
all
the
rest
of
the
evidence,
but
there
were
eight
occasions
which
was
pointed
out
in
the
dissent
in
which
evidence
was
admitted
against
this
or
that
defendant
and
not
against
the
rest
of
the
defendants.
and
in
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
lutwak,
despite
the
fact
that
that
had
been
vigorously
pointed
out
and
despite
the
fact
that
obviously
is
a
much
tougher
case
than
one
in
which
only
a
single
admission
is
the
subject
of
a
caution
to
the
jury.
in
that
case,
this
court
stated
that
they
recognized
the
burden
on
the
jury,
and
again,
implicitly
recognized
that
juries
have
to
be
trusted
with
things
infinitely
more
dangerous.
juries
are
constantly
cautioned
not
to
allow
their
prejudices
to
intervene.
they're
cautioned
not
to
allow
the
fact
that
defendant
does
not
take
the
stand,
that
they
must
not
give
any
effect
to
that.
and
by
and
large,
if
the
jury
system
is
to
survive,
it
must
be
--
the
jury
must
be
considered
as
having
some
integrity
and
some
sense.
now,
in
that
case,
the
--
this
court,
in
lutwak,
stated,
all
these
difficulties
have
been
pointed
out
in
several
cases
citing
them.
the
rule
has,
nonetheless,
been
applied
and
it's
cited
at
blumenthal,
which
is
a
yet
earlier
case
of
this
court
in
which
a
group
of
persons
selling
whisky
over
the
opa
scale
price
were
brought
together
and
admissions
of
some
were
admitted
against
themselves
and
not
against
others.
the
government
is
aware
of
the
problem,
but
we
think
that
the
solution
of
it,
to
throw
up
hands
and
just
about
vitiate
all
the
opportunity
for
joint
trials
by
saying
that
you
simply
can't
have
a
joint
trial,
if
there's
an
item
of
evidence,
as
in
this
case,
a
single
item
of
evidence
that
can't
be
used
against
all
of
them,
you
can't
have
a
joint
trial.
well,
that's
too
extreme.
we
think
that
that
is
a
retroactive
changing
of
the
rules
after
the
trial
has
been
held
under
the
rules.
we
may
submit
also
that
if
this
court
were
sitting
today
as
a
legislative
body,
being
asked
to
change
the
rules
are
to
enact
law,
that
it
would
require
pretty
serious
consideration
to
make
an
absolute
rule
that
you
can't
have
joint
trials
unless
every
item
of
evidence
can
be
used
against
each
defendant.
the
congress,
when
it
first
enacted
the
joint
trial
statute
did
so
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
these
were
piling
up
in
cases
against
defendants
and
there
is
also
protection
for
the
defendants
in
the
fact
that
if
you
had
five
separate
trials,
their
expenses
would
go
up
and
the
question
of
how
they
might
be
prejudiced
would
depend
on
the
order
trial.
so
we
say
that
--
that
in
this
case
to
retroactively
change
the
rules
and
make
an
arbitrary
assumption
on
a
sort
of
a
psychological
speculation
that
this
court
has
rejected
three
times,
is
something
that
doesn't
--
isn't
called
for
in
the
merits.
now,
somewhat
tied
in
with
this,
of
course,
is
the
question
of
what
was
there
before
this
jury,
in
addition.
i
have
mentioned
this
extremely
clear
pattern
of
how
this
worked
and
that
was
proved
as
i
say
again
independently
except
that
one
detail
by
the
testimony
of
good
police
work.
but
that
isn't
all.
it
isn't
to
be
considered
the
object
of
a
conspiracy
statute.
it's
not
--
it
is
to
enable
all
of
the
people
who
really
conspire
and
who
are
in
the
agreement
to
be
tried
and
to
show
the
entire
pattern.
now,
these
three
patterns
that
--
that
--
in
which
petitioner
was
caught
were
not
exclusive.
they
are
not
something
that
just
happened.
the
--
the
alcohol
agents
were
watching,
the
two
physical
plants
involved
in
this
matter
for
a
couple
of
years.
i'll
go
back
to
1949,
the
beginning
of
the
conspiracy,
the
first
thing
that
happened,
and
i'll
have
to
go
quickly
and
i'm
afraid
in
adequately.
the
first
thing
that
happened
was
when
they
bought
that
garage.
the
government
put
on
the
witness,
as
witness,
the
owner
of
that
garage.
he
said
he
had
mentioned
in
the
neighborhood
tavern
that
he
had
the
cottage
and
garage
for
sale,
but
it's
clear
on
specific
questions
and
answers
that
he
was
approached.
he
did
not
approach
pierro,
who
started
the
negotiations.
what
is
also
in
the
record
and
what
is
omitted
is
that
again,
petitioner
was
the
man
who
was
always
there.
pierro
worked
on
the
negotiations
and
did
the
talking,
but
by
his
side
in
the
conversations
related
to
this
cottage
were
already,
petitioner
and
margiasso.
then
it
was
petitioner
and
pierro
who
went
up
and
sized
up
that
cottage
for
nearly
an
hour.
that's
all
in
the
record
and
this
--
the
test
is
--
testimonies
before
the
jury.
and
what
is
also
important
is
petitioner
was
doing
all
this
under
an
alias.
he
had
the
name
"bobbie
london"
and
that
is
the
basis
of
his
dealings
with
this
clearly
disinterested
outsider
crohn
(ph)
who
sold
them
the
cottage.
now,
after
that,
that
cottage
was
boarded
up.
it
was
specifically
adduced
in
evidence
that
there
were
no
other
repairs
at
any
moment
made.
petitioner
was
not
seen
doing
the
actual
physical
day
labor
of
boarding
up
that
cottage.pierro
and
another
man,
unidentified,
did
that.
but
petitioner
was
seen
there
and
if
i
may
jump
in
the
timescale
a
moment,
just
a
couple
of
weeks
in
december
of
1951,
before
the
agents
closed
in,
petitioner
was
one
man
who
could
get
into
that
padlocked
cottage
where
the
--
where
they
later
found
some
over
500
gallons
of
unstamped
alcohol.
now
it
--
it's
not
an
improper
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
pardon
me?
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
the
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
by
the
actual
observation
of
two
agents
in
the
testimony
to
the
effect
that
he
went
up
there
and
backed
up
his
car
and
opened
the
door.
he
did
that.
he
was
seen
doing
that.
that
is
outside
testimony.
it
--
it
is
in
our
brief
if
you
wish
to
reference
right
now,
you
can.
yes.
but
we
go
beyond
the
bounds
of
saying
that
he
was
just
a
good
friend
when
we
--
when
a
--
an
operation
of
this
size
from
its
references,
possible
potential
informers
or
government
witnesses
to
be
sitting
around,
always
present
at
that
time.
i
want
to
go
into
the
matter
of
two
trucks,
which
were
involved
in
this
operation.
petitioner
and
pierro
and
here
again
on
completely
in
this
separate
testimony
of
the
agents.
they
were
seen
to
go
to
a
parking
lot
and
bought
a
diamond
t
truck,
false
registry
of
the
plates,
petitioner
was
seen
driving
it
a
number
of
times,
took
it
out
by
himself,
gassed
it
up
and
when
that
--
when
that
truck
was
not
sitting
beside
that
garage
storehouse,
it
was
sitting
across
the
street
from
petitioner's
residence.
now,
a
neighbor
testified.
he
was
a
man
who
worked
nights.
he
said
he
would
come
by
there.
this
was
late
in
1951.
at
2:30
in
the
morning,
that
truck
would
be
gone.
the
daytime,
it'd
be
back.
there
was
another
truck,
a
dodge
truck
which
petitioner
also
was
seen
working
on.
and
here
again,
this
is
upright
eyewitness
testimony.
petitioner
was
seen
carrying
with
margiasso
some
cartons
for
5-gallon
cans.
all
this
alcohol
was
found
in
5-gallon
cans.
seen
carrying
those
cartons
from
the
dodge
truck
into
the
--
into
the
diamond
t
truck,
and
then
they
drove
out
to
the
garage
with
it.
now,
let
me
point
out
a
little
technicality
lest
i
misrepresent
the
case
even
inadvertently,
that
the
--
the
agents
obviously
could
not
sit
out
in
front
of
that
place.
they
viewed
from
a
distance.
one
of
their
investigative
practices
was
to
drive
by
and
in
that
quick
glance
they
had
to
see
what
was
going.
if
they
followed
petitioner
from
his
house
to
the
garage
they
might
trail
him
at
a
distance
then
drive
by
their
place.
that
is
all
in
the
evidence.
i
can't
urge
strongly
enough
that
the
--
that
the
government
brief's
summary,
which,
of
course,
is
longer
than
what
i
can
say
today,
is
still
inadequate
to
give
you
the
feeling
of
accuracy
and
detail
that
was
before
that
jury.
now,
in
this
case,
the
agent
testified
that
he
saw
them
go
up
to
the
garage
door,
open
the
garage
door,
put
some
furniture
in
there.
may
i
make
it
clear
that
on
that
occasion,
the
agent
had
to
run
before
he
saw
them
actually
putting
those
cartons
into
the
garage.
on
the
other
hand,
i
don't
think
that
detracts
in
the
least,
that
they
were
handling
those
cartons.
of
course,
if
petitioner
had
been
disposed
to
bring
in
evidence
of
any
legitimate
use
for
those
cartons,
that
will
be
one
thing
that
cans
were
not
found
in
the
cartons
necessarily,
but
they
were
engaged
in
a
joint
operation
and
that's
the
essence
of
conspiracy,
an
agreement
which
necessarily
has
to
be
evidenced
by
all
that's
seen.
so,
we
have
here
--
well,
i
--
i
think
that
the
--
that
the
petitioner's
counsel
is
adverted
to
the
fact
that
petitioner
was
seen
there
at
the
cottage
and
perhaps
in
the
attempt
to
defend
that
and
the
only
way
that
they
did
try,
there
is
more
eloquence
and
more
effect
on
the
jury
than
anything
that
could
have
happened
in
any
other
respect.
a
neighbor
testified
to
having
seen
petitioner
at
this
garage
premises
and
she's
testified
that
--
that
the
woman
that
was
living
at
those
premises
was
a
--
had
introduced
petitioner
as
a
cousin.
petitioner
then
--
petitioner's
counsel
at
the
trial
then
called
this
woman
back
as
their
own
witness
and
tried
to
adduce
from
her
some
testimony
that
maybe
petitioner's
business
were,
out
there,
was
social.
asked
them
--
asked
this
lady
whether
he
was
out
there
with
the
woman
and
the
instant
that
the
witness
replied
no-no,
she
was
(inaudible)
dismissed
and
taken
from
the
stand.
and
that
is
the
only
explanation
or
attempted
explanation
that
any
of
these
petitioners
made.
now,
as
--
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
additional
detail
with
respect
to
the
nights
in
question.
i
have
observed
in
the
brief,
although
not
in
today's
argument
there
was
nothing
secretive
because
some
of
this
was
done
in
daylight.
but
there's
something
very
substantial
and
secretive
about
boarding
up
the
garage
windows
and
that
was
so
recognized
in
the
trial
because
petitioner's
attorneys
tried
to
adduce
from
the
neighbors
a
--
a
danger
of
floods,
a
danger
of
children
playing
and
so
forth,
all
to
--
to
explain
why
these
glass
windows
of
the
garage
were
boarded
up.
nothing
more
has
come
of
that
and
its
obvious
purpose,
of
course,
was
there
eloquent
to
petitioner
when
he
visited
as
it
is
to
the
jury
when
they
finally
found
over
500
gallons
of
alcohol
there.
now,
that
is
the
posture
of
the
case.
i
want
to
mention
also
the
posture
of
the
trial
because
if
ever
a
judge,
and
i
think
this
is
conceded
all
around,
truly
separated
the
case,
this
was
it.
it
was
not
like
the
opper
case
where
there
was
--
the
dangerous
fact
that
in
the
middle
of
a
testimony,
the
confession
was
admitted,
and
despite
admonitions,
the
jury
might
intermingle
it.
it
is
true
what
was
said
by
opposing
counsel
that
this
confession
came
in
after
the
rest
of
the
testimony.
but
at
the
risk
of
doubling
the
court's
work,
i
hope
that
this
will
be
read
later.
we
have
placed
in
--
in
--
largely
because
there's
only
typed-in
transcript
here.
we
have
set
forth
in
great
detail
how
the
jury
was
protected
from
untoward
effects
here.
so
that
the
case
will,
as
i
think
was
suggested
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
have
to
go
on
a
new
absolute
rule
rather
than
any
showing
of
real
confusion
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
it
was
a
--
it
was
an
affidavit
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
--
of
one
person.
there
was
no
case
here
as
--
as
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
pardon?
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
at
the
end,
but
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
but
before,
very
long
instructions
which
went
to
the
other
matters
again.
that
will
appear
also
in
the
record.
in
other
words,
it
was
safeguarded
in
this
fashion.
first
of
all,
as
far
as
there
being
any
surprise
element
as
pointed
out
the
--
the
prosecuting
attorney
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial
adverted
to
this
--
to
this
admission
by
whitley
and
he
did
it
not
in
any
way
that
would
influence
anyone,
but
rather
to
a
--
he
was
going
through
the
chronology
of
events
there.
that
was
the
time
to
--
to
demand
the
severance
or
to
appropriate
or
to
call
for
any
other
remedies
and
not,
as
well
as
the
case
after
two
and
a
half
days
of
the
trial
to
make
first
an
objection
that
it
should
not
be
binding
on
the
other
defendants.
that
was
the
first
objection
that
was
interposed
when
this
was
mentioned
and
the
judge
stated
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief
here,
immediately,
that
that
of
course
was
understood.
that
it
would
be
admitted
only
against
whitley.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
it
--
it
was
offered
and
the
judge
said
he
was
going
to
keep
that
entirely
separate
and
he
looked
up
the
law
in
it
and
then
when
all
of
the
other
evidence
was
in
separately
before
the
jury,
then
he
--
then
he
--
he
went
through
this
procedure
and
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
well,
that
[laughs]
--
that
the
real
objection
to
it
was
not
what
we
now
have
before
this
court.
whitley's
counsel
brought
in
the
standard
objection
of
coercion
and
the
like,
and
that
fell
very
badly
by
the
way.
beside,
i'll
just
have
to
refer
you
to
the
record.
it
was
never
pursued
and
whitley
of
course
has
not
--
it
was
never
pursued
here
or
elsewhere.
it
was
just
a
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
he
said
he
didn't
know
what
he
was
doing,
but
he
was
there
with
the
lawyer.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
he
had
some
other
things
to
think
about
of
great
moment.
in
this
respect,
the
question
that
was
raised
before
this
court
as
to
whether
it
would
be
possible
to
--
to
delete,
so
that
the
question
would
not
come
up
and
he
concluded,
and
i
think
rightly,
that
there
had
been
so
much
evidence
against
detailing
the
whole
thing.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
that
is
not
fair.
there
was
an
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
think
that
the
judge's
concern
was
not
as
to
whether
he
could
validly
admit
the
document
with
proper
admonitions
but
it
was
a
very
great
solicitude
only
as
to
making
sure
that
it
was
safeguarded
by
the
proper
admonitions,
not
the
doubt
which
is
stated.
that
is
from
my
own
reading
of
the
record
and
i
--
i
recommend
that
a
reading
of
the
record
will
dispose
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
that
is
right.
i
just
want
to
make
clear
that
he
was
not
in
doubt
after
lutwak
and
the
other
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
yes.
i
--
i
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
pardon
me.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
that
is
right.
all
the
rest
of
this
material
from
the
--
as
to
the
--
the
mechanics.
for
instance,
in
the
confession,
the
mechanic
--
mechanics
are
indicated
that
the
--
that
the
buyer
would
take
his
car
to
a
certain
point
and
--
and
this
filling
station
with
such
a
point
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
--
and
that
margiasso
would
drive
off
with
it.
that
is
all
in
the
evidence.
there's
nothing
new
about
that.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
that
is
--
is
just
a
statement
of
what
is
in
the
evidence
three
times,
except
of
the
pay
master
aspect
which
i
accepted,
that
he
did
the
collecting.
but
as
to
--
as
to
paoli,
being
present
for
these
things,
sending
margiasso
off
to
fill
up
the
car,
bringing
it
back
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
yes,
surely.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
well,
if
--
first
of
all,
i
think
that
we
disagree
as
to
how
much
is
added
by
this
matter.
when
you
say
that
he
adduced
some
additional
earlier
occasions
in
which
the
same
pattern
was
going
through,
i
don't
believe
that
adds
much
to
the
force
upon
the
jury
of
the
vivid
description
of
the
three
patterns.
as
i
said,
the
only
thing
that
was
added
was
that
he
was
the
paymaster.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
yes,
and
i
would
defer
the
answer
to
that
until
the
totality
of
the
evidences
before
the
court.
i
said
at
the
outset,
that
what
i've
given
the
court
here
is
lamentably,
skeletal
depiction
of
what
happened.
what
--
what
has
been
added
and
what
has
just
been
read,
it
seems
to
me,
is
a
repetition
of
the
pattern,
but
no
explanation
or
deviation
from
the
pattern
of
any
moment
from
those
three
clear
occasions
when
that
is
exactly
what
he
did
and
exactly
what
was
testified
to
before
the
jury.
now,
there
were
occasions
before
and
the
jury
no
doubt
could
infer
from
the
evidence
before
it,
not
even
the
confession.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
that
has
happened
lots
of
times
and
then
the
agents
couldn't
catch
up
all
the
time.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
whitley
was
there
twice.
on
--
on
december
18,
a
pontiac
drove
up
which
the
agents
identified.
they
didn't
see
whitley
or
identified
him
as
such.
they
got
away
on
the
night
of
--
of
december
18,
but
that
same
pontiac
came
back
in
the
night
of
--
of
the
28th.
at
that
time,
whitley
was
caught
and
from
that,
i
would
say
that
there
were
clearly
before
the
jury
two
occasions
in
which
it
was
a
proper
inference
that
that
heavy
loading
of
the
car
was
exactly
like
--
was
the
other
two
occasions.
i
--
i
don't
want
to
be
taken
to
minimize
the
fact
that
anything
that
you
--
that
is
admitted
against
only
one
defendant
may
carry
over
a
little,
but
the
courts
have
got
to
keep
going.
they
can't
have
five
trials
for
one
trial
and
the
defendants
cannot
have
five
trials
when
one
trial
would
suffice.
there
is
carry
over
and
this
court
has
three
times
stated
that
that
carry
over,
dangerous
as
it
may
be,
is
a
proper
--
that
the
--
that
the
trial
judge
does
not
abuse
his
discretion
if
he
is
very
careful
about
seeing
to
it
that
the
jury
separates
that
evidence
and
doesn't
apply
it.
now
in
this
case,
there
was
no
real
problem
of
intermingling
of
the
evidence
and
two
or
three
defendant
saying
this
you
can
--
you
can
carry
over
against
defendant
a,
b,
and
c
but
not
against
d
and
e
nothing
of
that
kind.
there
was
one
affidavit,
one
defendant,
and
the
judge
clearly
told
them,
"don't
hold
it
against
any
of
the
rest."
now
that,
a
jury
can
do.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
yes.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
for
these
reasons.
first,
they
did
not
charge
the
others
as
--
as
sellers.
the
substantive
counts
were
possession.
now,
the
technicalities
of
actual
possession
by
petitioner
might
not
have
been
made
out.
in
fact,
he
was
clever
enough
to
see
to
it
that
he
didn't
have
possession.
he
sent
margiasso
out
to
fill
up
the
cars
and
to
bring
them
back.
it's
just
for
that
purpose
that
congress
has
enacted
a
conspiracy
statute
so
that
a
person
who
takes
one
piece
of
a
process
can
be
caught.
i
don't
purport
to
know
what
was
it,
within
the
judgments
of
the
prosecuting
attorneys
in
this
case.
but
i
do
say
that
these
substantive
accounts
might
well
have
failed
as
to
actual
possession
or
even
a
clear
aiding
and
abetting
of
a
possession
by
petitioner
in
this
case,
but
he
was
definitely
in
the
conspiracy
whereby
margiasso
got
the
possession,
and
where
king
got
the
possession
and
whitley
got
the
possession
as
to
the
actual
handling
of
this.
he
was
the
man
who
was
always
there.
