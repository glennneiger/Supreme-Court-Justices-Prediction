well,
this
is
what
i
have
reference
to.
this
is
whitley
speaking.
this
was
some
time
in
the
summer
of
1951.
bobbie
would
come
to
my
house
to
see
me.
if
i
placed
an
order
with
him,
he
would
set
the
date
and
the
time
for
seven
or
eight
o'clock
in
the
evening
when
i
was
to
pick
up
the
alcohol.
the
first
time
i
met
him
on
138
street
in
bruckner
boulevard
in
bronx,
he
took
my
car
and
was
gone
about
one-half
hour
and
then
returned
with
the
alcohol.
second
time,
i
met
him
on
the
corner
of
bruckner
boulevard
and
soundview
avenue.
from
then
on,
he
would
alternate
the
procedure.
i
would
meet
him
one
night
in
138
street,
and
the
next
time
at
soundview
avenue.
that
adds
only
a
little
you
think
to
what
you've
described
for
us
as
the
evidence
outside
the
confession?
