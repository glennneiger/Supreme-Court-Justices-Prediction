justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
begin
now
to
state
before
you
comment
on
it
exactly
what
took
place
in
the
admission
of
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
even-steven.
we've
got
the
record
and
you
have
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
record
shed
any
light
why
there
was
this
three-year
delay?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
was
ordinary
time
of
flagging
his
own
interest?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
readily
amend
what
the
judge
told
the
juries?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
what
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
it
--
must
we
not
assume
--
must
we
not
assume
that
there
was
enough
evidence
that
would
have
allowed
the
court
to
judge
to
send
the
case
to
the
jury
had
there
been
no
confessions
touching
how
you
fought
in
order
to
be
with
your
problem
not
the
first
part
of
your
argument,
but
on
the
question,
which
you
are
raising
on
this
of
the
admissibility
subject
to
admonition
must
we
not
have
sued
whereas
there's
no
point
in
the
argument
i
think
that
theoretically,
intellectually,
there
was
a
basis
of
the
jury
finding
him
guilty
on
what
clause
properly
allowed
to
go
to
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
--
that's
your
first
point
you
give.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
on
this
question,
and
the
question
that
you
raised
of
the
--
whether
the
admonition
to
the
jury
that
they
mustn't
consider
anything
pertaining
power
to
confession.
we
must
assume
that
other
--
that
there
is
--
we
must
assume
that
there
is
a
case
to
go
to
the
jury
apart
from
that.
is
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
that
you
don't
make
the
point.
you
do
make
the
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
--
and
i
suggest
(inaudible)
you
must
say
there
was
enough
apart
from
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
that's
not
--
that
does
--
that's
unrelated
to
the
question
of
confession.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
that's
all
i'm
saying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
suggest
before
you
sit
down
that
you
give
some
--
give
to
the
court
your
view
of
what
kind
of
principle
you
think
should
guide
us
in
making
this
determination?
unless,
you
offer
the
generality
that
no
confession
which
includes
a
reference
to
a
nominal
defendant,
to
a
co-defendant,
no
matter
how
restricted
by
the
court
is
of
--
is
an
admissible
doctrine
or
rather
that
the
--
the
admonition
is
too
weak
and
necessary
to
destroy
whatever
effect,
reference,
physical
reference
in
the
confession
you
convey.
now,
what
is
your
proposition
that
--
on
which
you
want
us
to
reverse
it?
now,
on
this
point,
i'm
not
talking
about
confession.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
is
your
proposition
of
law
unless
you
go
to
the
full
length
that
i've
indicated
that
whenever
you
got
co-defendants
of
a
conspiracy
case,
it
is
beyond
the
power
that
no
confession
can
be
admitted
that
makes
any
reference
by
name
to
a
co-defendant
who
isn't
himself
the
next
time
you
take
a
confession
no
matter
how
serious
and
clear
and
compelling
so
far
as
language
can
compel.
the
judge
admonishes
the
jury
and
paid
no
attention
to
it
and
only
restricted
to
the
person
whom
it
affects.
is
that
your
general
proposition
or
just
special?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
confession
the
last
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
an
affidavit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
actually
in
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
actually
within
course
of
the
trial,
eight
days
trial.
at
what
stage
of
the
trial
was
that
talked
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
the
end.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wasn't
introduced
two
and
a
half
days
after
the
trial
was
started?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
law
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
it
was
a
simple
case,
if
it
was
a
standard
rule
to
involve
that
the
confession
that
he
admitted
there
was
doctrine
that
was
learned
in
this
case
by
admonishing
the
juries
to
pay
no
attention
to
its
reference,
to
anybody
else
that
the
--
the
set
of
conventional
rule
doesn't
require
any
long
thought
than
to
bother
anybody.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
wasn't
awareness
of
the
psychological
mischief
that
this
could
--
generally
for
the
jury
no
matter
how
restrictive.
was
that
fair?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
trouble,
what
to
do
with
a
doctrine
which
implicated
a
(inaudible)
to
whom
it
wasn't
valid
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
you'll
find
more
than
to
the
--
very
alike
to
the
need
of
seeing
to
it
that
they
don't
have
it
count
against
this
petition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
i
don't
mean
to
advice
you
