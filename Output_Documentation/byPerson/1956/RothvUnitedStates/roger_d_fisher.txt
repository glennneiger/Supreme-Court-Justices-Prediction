mr.
roger
d.
fisher
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
too
go
and
start
out
by
saying
what
is
involved
in
this
case
that
distinguish
other
cases
and
what
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
first,
there
is
no
question
of
whether
the
exhibits
in
this
case
are
obscene.
that
issue
was
question
(a)
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
it
was
denied.
there
as
in
the
--
the
california
case,
there
are
questions
of
whether
or
not
the
matter
was
obscene,
entitled
to
find
that
that
issue
was
not
here.
there
is
no
question
of
prior
restraint
in
the
new
york
case.
petitioner
roth
got
everything
that
the
appellant,
kingsley
is
asking
for,
grand
jury,
jury
trial,
criminal
burden
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
there
is
no
question
of
administrative
discretion
as
is
involved
in
pending
post
office
cases
in
other
courts,
the
court
of
appeals
here
where
the
post
office
has
to
consider
whether
a
matter
is
mailable
or
not
to
be
eligible
for
second
class
privileges.
the
sole
question
on
a
limited
review
is
the
constitutionality
of
section
1461
as
applied
to
the
criminal
statute
to
the
mailing
of
obscene
material
in
united
states
mails.
the
matter
--
this
is
the
application
of
an
obscenity
statute
to
matter
which
is
concededly
obscene,
concededly
for
the
purposes
of
this
appeal.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
the
question
--
it
is
concededly
obscene
within
obscene,
the
standard
of
statutory
standard.
you
still
have
before
you
whether
a
statutory
standard
is
vague
on
its
face,
whether
the
language
is
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
and
enough
to
be
a
criminal
statute.if
it
means
anything,
these
--
these
advertising
circulars
in
this
one
book
are
obscene.you
still
have
the
question
whether
it
means
or
not.
then,
the
--
there
are
two
issues
besides
the
ninth
and
tenth
amendment
that
they're
the
--
they
form
the
basis
of
this
problem.
first,
it's
on
the
first
amendment,
can
anything
be
restrained
from
a
ground
that
it
is
obscene?
heretofore
has
been
unanimous
agreement
on
that
subject.
this
court
is
now
reconsidering
i
should
say
that
question.
in
doubleday,
the
hecate
country
case,
counsel
for
doubleday
did
not
even
suggest
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
but
only
as
applied
to
that
particular
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
but
the
standard,
the
new
york
standard
of
obscenity
did
not
challenge
the
constitutional
validity
of
an
obscenity
statute.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
i
--
i
lean
heavily
on
that,
i
think
of
the
easiest
grounds
which
decide
it.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
well,
the
--
the
argument
that
is
made
here
is
that
--
that
no
obscenity
statute
can
be
acted.
no
restraint
you
put
on
speech
unless
of
course
it's
conduct.
now
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
first
custom
statute
is
in
1842
and
this
one
is
1865.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
no,
not
at
all.
i
--
the
united
states
certainly
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
if
it
were
a
regulation
of
the
mail
and
if
congress
although
the
first
amendment
can
impose
no
restraint
whatever
on
speech
not
leading
to
conduct,
you
would
have
a
different
question
than
you'll
have
here.
petitioner
has
made
that
attack.
we
have
tried
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
thank
you,
your
honor.
we
have
assumed
that
in
the
granting
of
cert
in
these
three
cases
together,
the
court
wanted
to
reexamine
basic
questions
and
we've
discussed
them
in
the
brief
at
some
length.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
this
case
is
not.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
we
did
not
discuss
all
obscenity
statutes,
although
some
of
the
issues
go
far
beyond
issue
in
this
case.
the
fifth
amendment
attack,
which
is
levied,
is
that
the
statute
is
too
broad
and
too
vague.
now,
these
i
say
are
fifth
amendment
questions,
although
of
course
in
the
area
of
first
amendment
rights,
there
may
be
tighter
standards
of
broadness
or
tighter
standards
that's
definite
than
elsewhere.
when
you
are
considering
a
statute
which
imposes
a
restraint
in
the
name
of
social
interest,
a
--
which
maybe
freedom
of
the
press
and
the
side
who's
interesting
serve
by
that
restraint,
we
thought
the
court
entitled
to
know
the
best
of
our
ability,
what
the
interests
are
that
are
involved.
now,
you've
had
--
cited
to
you
in
the
briefs
the
bible,
shakespeare,
freud,
other
great
writers
as
being
the
sort
of
material
that
maybe
called
obscene.
that
is
not
the
sort
of
material
that
falls
within
the
statute
as
applied
and
traditionally
is
--
is
not
what
falls
within
it.
we
have
cited
to
you
a
number
of
tales
whether
they
were
hot
stuff
or
she
knew
what
she
wanted.
you
would
not
know
what
those
books
were.
we've
made
available
a
library
of
materials
that
came
to
the
government's
possession
and
the
post
office
which
can
illustrate
more
clearly
than
i.
depending
if
the
courts
should
wish
to
look
at
it,
that
material
which
is
a
kind
of
stuff
involved
basically
and
which
is
the
--
which
divides
the
interests
between
free
speech,
ideas
and
the
damage
to
the
persons
that
are
involved.
of
the
175
convictions,
fiscal
1956
under
the
post
office
statute,
166
pleaded
guilty.
the
issue
was
primarily,
this
case
is
not
one
of
whether
the
matter
is
obscene.
the
issue
--
both
parties
know
what's
involved.
the
usual
case
the
person
believes
it's
obscene,
he
gets
caught.
the
attack
in
the
reply
brief
filed
this
morning
by
petitioner
in
this
case
says
that,
“we
justify
pornography
statute,
not
an
obscenity
statute.”
i'd
like
to
--
to
clarify
what
we
may
have
said
in
the
brief,
bring
a
little
focus
on
that.
wherever
a
line
is
drawn
at
any
point
in
this
area,
there
will
be
three
kinds
of
material
that
will
fall
below
the
line.
there
will
be
a
few
people
who
are
expressing
themselves
as
they
see
fit
and
that
form
of
expression
happens
to
be
so
concentrated
and
so
vile
in
the
eyes
of
motion
that
it's
taken
as
a
whole,
both
are
below
that
line.
there
will
be
some
more
people
who
are
catering
to
the
interests
that
are
barred
by
the
statute,
catering
to
the
erotic,
catering
to
those
interests
which
the
statute
is
designed
to
protect
from
interference
and
who
are
skating
as
close
to
the
line
as
they
can.
this
is
what
we
define
the
petitioner
here,
roth
is
in
the
borderline
area.
he
is
trying
to
produce
material,
has
been
producing
material
which
if
confronted,
he
would
not
concede
as
obscene.
he
would
hope
that
a
jury
of
12
would
not
unanimously
agree
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
if
it
fell
within
that
class.
the
third
category
are
those
who
don't
care
about
the
line
or
rather
they
know
about
the
line
and
are
deliberately
trying
to
produce
material
which
they
know
to
be
illegal,
comparable
to
bootleg
whiskey,
there's
no
question
about
it.
they're
not
trying
to
follow.
they're
trying
to
produce
the
material
that's
prohibited
by
the
statute.
now,
we
--
in
running
through
the
convictions
which
figures
were
available
here
in
the
post
office
department
of
the
published
material,
pressed,
reproduced
photo,
commercially
reproduced
material
which
is
involved
in
this
litigation.
about
90%
of
that
kind
of
--
of
published
material
falls
into
the
black
market,
hardcore
pornography
sort.
now,
that
is
not
a
reliable
statistic
which
anyone
--
you
need
to
put
much
--
put
much
weight
on.
that's
our
judgment.
whether
it's
90%
now,
i
don't
know.
if
the
statute
is
declared
unconstitutional,
i
believe
it
will
play
the
volume
of
material
going
through
the
mails
to
be
substantially
larger.
this
commercial
material
is
unpleasant
to
talk
about,
unpleasant
to
think
about.
the--
the
briefs,
amicus
curia
filed
in
this
court
indicate
that
people
prefer
to
talk
about
civil
liberties,
the
borderline
between
a
great
novel
and
a
what
might
be
considered
obscene,
the
issues
where
censorship
may
trespass
on
vital
scientific
works
of
art.
those
are
much
more
interesting
issues
than
the
ones
we
have
here.
this
matter
is
concededly
obscene
if
anything
is
obscene
and
the
statute
question
is,
"can
congress
bar
that
stuff
from
the
mail?"
i
think
that
risk
of
trespassing
in
the
court.
i
like
to
just
briefly
what
is
involved.
a
large
part
is
photographs,
photographs
of
all
sorts
of
person,
people,
generally
without
any
clothes
on
in
all
cultures,
groups,
individuals.
they're
engaged
in
activity,
perversion
of
every
kind.
these,
if
you
read
the
briefs
indicate
that
this
is
a
vital
freedom
of
--
these
are
the
ideas
which
must
be
communicated.
the
idea
of
content
within
the
first
amendment
terms
of
any
such
material
is
negative.second
category
of
materials,
a
little
booklet
of
series
of
sex
episodes,
one
after
the
other
usually
illustrated
these
photographs
or
drawings.
third
category,
are
comic
books,
especially
drawn
for
the
pornographic
trade.
fourth
category
is
motion
picture
films.
we
did
not
make
any
of
those
available
to
the
court.
if
they
should
want
to
see
them,
it
could
be
arranged.
they
are
the
worst,
most
vile,
any
form
of
pornography
in
my
estimation.
this
material
has
no
idea
of
content.
if
there
is
any
idea,
it
can
easily
be
said
by
other
means.
the
kingsley
books
and
other
books
illustrate
that
you
can
discuss
this
--
this
subject
to
sexual
morality
and
conduct
without
being
obscene.
you
do
not
have
to
offend
and
be
as
shocking
as
explicit,
as
vulgar,
as
debasing
at
the
material
which
falls
within
the
current
concept
of
criminal
obscenity.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
eight
and
16
millimeter
films
are
produced
in,
i
guess
about
a
300
foot
roll.
it
has
a
short
plot
to
it.
it
starts
off
with
characters
and
ends
up
with
all
forms
of
perverted
conduct.
they
--
this
is
currently
the
price
range
of
these
films,
i'm
told
runs
about
$75
to
a
$100.
there
is
no
copyright
of
course.
so,
they
sell
them
the
first
time
to
get
enough
to
protect
themselves
from
people
who
are
black
marketing
around.
they're
frequently
not
transferred
to
the
mail.
the
mail
gets
it
open
to
the
advertising,
letting
him
know
through
the
mail
if
they
are
available.
they
try
to
do
it
through
railway
express
where
the
package
is
not
so
easily
noticed
as
sending
films
by
first
class
mail,
which
is
the
way
to
keep
it
from
being
inspected.
if
you
see
a
moving
film,
picture
films
going
by
first
class
mail,
you
--
the
post
office
department
has
to
be
suspicious
and
generally
investigate.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
french
books
running
--
coming
in
from
paris
smuggled
in
running
about
32
pages
typically
with
four
photographic
illustrations
put
out
by
two
or
three
presses
in
paris'
black
market
is
illegal
under
french
law
too,
i
understand,
have
a
$5
price
tag
on
the
front,
whether
this
is
a
common
--
for
a
discount
price
to
customers,
i
don't
know.
that's
the
--
it
appeared
about
$5,
sometimes
$10
on
a
small
book
that
have
32
pages.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
this
is
--
the
1956,
one
of
the
1956
convictions
under
the
statute
had
a
whole
lot
of
material
involved
which
--
which
the
comparable
prices
of
this
assortment.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
it
is
the
charge
below
in
this
case
is
we
believe
approved
of
this
case,
endorses
that
charge
as
being
within
the
realm
of
acceptable
obstruction
of
the
statutes
and
it
appears
on
--
relevant
part
appears
on
page
25,
26
of
the
record.
the
--
the
relevant
points,
the
key
points,
matter
which
must
the
court
charge
the
jury.
i'm
reading
to
you
the
bottom
of
page
25.
“the
matter
must
be
calculated
to
corrupt
and
debauch
the
minds
and
morals
of
those
into
his
hands
that
may
fall.
and
then
on
--
to
avoid
the
governed
--
now
that
he
made
it
clear
that
into
his
hands
that
may
fall
should
be
judged
by
the
impact
on
the
average
person
in
the
community.
that's
on
page
26,
“you
determine
it's
impact
upon
the
average
person
of
community.”
little
paragraph
on
page
26,
“the
books,
pictures
and
circulars
must
be
judged
as
a
whole
in
their
entire
context,”
and
you
were
not
to
consider
the
text
to
separate
portions
in
reaching
a
conclusion.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
right,
this
i
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
take
it
if
you
must
read
that
in
connection
with
the
sentence.
the
matter
must
be
calculated
to
corrupt
and
debauch
the
minds
and
morals.
there
was
an
issue
raised
in
the
fourth
question
for
certiorari.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
your
honor?
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
right.
i'd
be
--
the
--
the
--
one
of
the
questions
insert
which
petitioner
asked
for
certiorari
was,
“did
the
trial
court
in
its
charge
de
jure
so
dissect,
impose
the
colocation
of
terms
as
to
render
the
statute
vague
and
indefinite?”
the
court
denied
certiorari
on
that
question.
so,
i
take
it
that
the
--
any
confusion
that
might
creep
in
as
to
whether
this
particular
charge
with
the
little
--
by
this
discussing
filthy
and
saying
it
can
offend
the
--
offend
the
community
to
be
obscene,
it
must
corrupt
and
debauch
the
morals.
it's
not
before
the
court,
but
if
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
concede
it
to
have
fall
within
the
obscenity
part,
not
the
filthy
part.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
right.
it
certainly
is,
your
honor.
i
take
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
take
it
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
now,
he
--
the
--
i
--
i
come
back
to
the
sentence
i
prefer
on
the
bottom,
page
25.
he
must
find
the
matters
calculate
to
corrupt
and
debauch
the
minds
and
morals.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
the
matter
here
was
considered
and
argued
by
both
sides
as
being
obscene,
not
filthy.
the
filthy
one,
the
definition
of
filthy
was
pertaining
to
that
sort
of
treatment
for
sexual
matters
such
as
a
vulgar,
indecent
way,
so
it
tends
to
rouse
the
feeling
of
disgust
and
revulsion.
and
one
of
the
issues
which
they've
tried
to
raise
was
that
this
--
this
was
inconsistent
with
the
fact
that
it
must
corrupt
and
debauch.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
indictment
appears
--
i
haven't
checked
all
the
counts,
but
the
basic
count
was
vile,
obscene,
nude
and
lascivious.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
yes,
sir.
that's
the
--
that
is
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
well,
the
definition
which
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
would
think
it
read
the
charge
in
a
whole
--
in
the
whole
context.
the
basic
principle
we
believe
that
something
to
be
obscene
must
be
of
such
a
character
or
that
tends
to
corrupt
and
debauch
the
morals.
i
also
think
that
offensive
under
a
stronger,
perhaps
a
stronger
language,
shocking.
the
--
it's
an
epithet
type
matter
that
the
psychological
injury
could
be
obscene
within
the
meaning
of
this
statute.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
our
--
our
position
is
that
the
clear
and
present
danger
test
need
not
be
one
of
words
leading
to
action,
but
as
in
the
breard
and
alexandria
where
the
peddlers
ringing
the
doorbell
creates
a
clear
and
present
danger,
the
peace
and
quiet
of
the
home
will
be
disturbed
that
allows
ruckus
noise
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
with
two
difference,
your
honor,
as
i
read
the
cases
there,
there's
another
set
that
deals
with
where
one
interest
of
society
is
being
impinged
upon
by
an
excessive
use
of
free
speech
as
an
allowed
and
ruckus
soundtrack.
it
is
not
by
speaking
very
loudly,
they
will
lead
people
to
action.
it's
that
the
loudness
of
the
soundtrack
of
--
disturbs
the
privacy
of
the
home
and
offends
the
peace
and
quiet
people
in
it
to
have
the
speech
exercise
at
that
pitch.
the
peddler
who
comes
to
the
door
selling
magazines,
talking
about
magazines
maybe
restrained
even
though
he's
though
he's
taking
about
it.
and
particularly,
if
he's
talking
pots,
aluminum
kitchenware,
even
the
members
of
--
a
citizen
in
breard
indicated
that
if
the
content
of
the
speech
was
about
pot,
he
would
have
even
a
lower
order
of
priority
in
that
which
the
court
agreed
could
be
restrained
in
that
case.
we
do
not
think
you
have
to
have
a
clear
and
present
danger
between
words
and
the
conduct
resulting
from
that
induced
by
the
words.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
clear
and
present
danger
of
an
entry
to
an
interest
which
society
can
protect.
we've
suggested
in
the
brief
that
this
ran
down
are
four.
there
is
the
conduct,
immediate
conduct.
the
person
can
seize
photographs
of
--
of
sexual
perversion,
moving
pictures
of
--
of
perverted
conduct
taking
place
or
booklets
and
think
only
that's
to
the
experiment
myself.
we
think
there's
a
serious
risk
of
that
one
which
the
legislature
could
properly
act
upon.
second,
is
long
range
conduct
induced
by
a
breaking
down
of
morals?
this
--
the
--
that
you
read
the
books,
it's
not
that
you're
immediately
aroused
to
do
something
but
to
gradually
fill
your
mind
with
a
thought
that
every
seems
to
be
doing
it.
this
is
kind
of
a
--
things
are
going,
“let's
have
some
fun,”
illicit
sex
life
or
various
kinds
of
activity,
because
your
moral
standards
are
broken
down
by
the
hip
and
reading
the
more
--
the
mail,
you
get
circulars,
advertising
this
sort
of
material.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
no.
i
think
that
the
--
there
is
an
effect
on
morality
that
if
you'll
peruse,
i
invite
your
attention
to
the
library
which
we've
boxed
it
to
a
file
and
i
think
you'd
--
a
diet
of
that
material
coming
through
the
mail
into
the
homes
of
america
would
have
a
definite
effect
on
the
conduct
of
--
of
the,
not
only
the
children,
but
the
parents
and
others
who
are
other
than
family
who
received
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no.
i'm
saying
the
interest
we've
gone,
that's
one.
another
interest
is
the
--
is
the
injury
or
the
epithet,
the
psychological
harm
of
the
housewife
who
opens
the
morning
mail
and
finds
one
of
mr.
roth's
circulars
which
he
certainly
wrote
a
--
upon
a
lottery
circular
as
far
as
how
strongly
she
feels.
this
--
these
circulars
create
a
--
there's
a
strong
interest
of
not
being
offended
and
being
hit
in
the
face
with
--
with
the
dirty
pictures
and
just
debasing
discussion
of
sex
in
the
home,
the
morning
mail.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
one
of
our
key
points
is
that
this
is
an
area
where
no
one
can
know
what
it
causes.
actually,
even
in
your
vital
speech
case,
you
can't
tell
whether
a
speech
is
going
to
induce
conduct
and
even
less
can
tell,
whether
this
is
sort
of
material.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
two
other
interests
that
i
thought
were
going
to
be
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
affected
by
it.
let
me
see
if
i
can
come
--
come
up
with
them.
the
invasion
of
the
privacy
of
the
home,
and
this
is
particularly
we're
dealing
with
the
male.
this
is
the
captive
audience
who
cannot
avoid
the
material
coming
to
them.
they
have
withdrawn
within
the
four
walls
to
get
away
from
the
hurly-burly
of
their
life.
this
is
their
privacy.
this
is
their
training
ground
for
children.
this
is
where
they
--
be
away
from
it
all
where
they
can
have
their
private
and
intimate
life
of
their
own.
united
states
mails
have
an
easement
over
their
house.
first
class
letters
come
through.
you
--
you've
got
to
open
them
or
you're
on
your
notice,
it
maybe
a
tax
bill,
it
maybe
an
assessment,
it
maybe
some
kind
of
matter
you're
--
open
the
mail.
the
circulars
in
this
case
were
sent
by
first
class
mail,
but
no
charge
for
the
circular.
this
was
sent
out
advertising
matter.
and
it's
in
this
home
where
the
privacy,
this
is
more
of
a
captive
audience,
mr.
justice
douglas
than
the
street
car,
i
believe,
where
the
--
the
radio
commercial
comes
over
on
the
street
cars
they
have
(voice
overlap).
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
it's
a
fence,
it
comes
in
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
two,
we
injure
the
privacy
of
their
home.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
say
it
doesn't
have
to
be
shoved.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
there
--
72,
i
think.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
there
are
number
of
cases
in
which
this
court
even
after
clear
and
present
danger
is
found
that
speech
could
cause
an
injury
which
would
justify
its
restraint,
kovacs
and
cooper
and
the
breard
and
alexandria
are
two
cases.
i
think
that
if
it
--
i
don't
believe
it
has
to
be
in
a
clear
and
present
danger.
i'm
suggesting
the
interest,
if
you
want
to
call
it
clear
and
present
danger,
you
can
say
there's
the
danger
of
the
privacy
of
the
home
being
clear
and
present
danger.
mr.
roth
is
free
to
send
out
hundreds
of
thousands
of
these
circulars
with
any
kind
of
material
in
them
at
all.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that
--
that
some
restraints
can
be
imposed
on
how
loud
speech
is
spoken.
this
is
more
of
the
form
of
the
speech
and
the
content.
this
is
a
nudist
in
the
park
who
wants
to
talk
about
a
nuder.
he
takes
off
his
clothes
and
expresses
himself.
reasonable
police
regulations
can
say
“put
on
a
pair
of
pants.”
you
can
say
the
same
ideas,
but
when
you
bring
your
ideas
in
the
public
arena,
don't
offend
everybody,
be
well-clothed.
this
is
the
kind
of
restraint
we're
talking
about
here.
if
mr.
roth
has
ideas,
he
talk
about
--
he
thinks
moral
concepts
should
be
changed,
he's
free
to
talk
about
that.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
the
text
as
well.
i
said
if
the
--
that
there's
no
idea
which
shall
be
found
to
be
obscene,
homosexuality.nothing
is
going
to
be
barred
because
of
the
idea
of
content.
he's
going
to
be
barred
because
of
the
way
in
which
it's
put.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
there
is.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
don't
think
it
makes
much
difference
whether
you
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
no.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
but
i
--
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
and
i
think
that
abridging
the
freedom
of
the
speech
is
not
violated
a
little
bit
by
restraining,
selling
of
obscene
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
think
it's
the
--
that
a
restraint
on
libel
is
not
prohibited
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
to
pay
off
most
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
no,
i
think
its
not.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
don't
think
you
do.
i
think
however
that
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
it
would
have
been
easy
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
(voice
overlap)
that
argue
those
cases
here.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
the
only
question,
mr.
judge
frankfurter
i
had
was,
would
it
be
easy
for
the
government
to
come
in
and
say,
“once
something
is
obscene,
it's
beyond
the
realm
of
protection.”
the
first
amendment
has
no
concern
with
it.
i
think
that
would
have
been
an
unhealthy
analysis
for
the
government
to
make.
i
think
we
should
say
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
--
i
would
--
if
i
convey
that
impression
i've
heard
there's
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
will
say
this
is
not
within
the
provision
of
the
constitution.
i
will
say
that
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
--
i
learned
from
opinions
i've
read
that
at
least
some
members
of
this
court,
there's
a
certain
amount
of
balancing
of
competing
interest
that
must
be
done
in
--
in
figuring
out
whether
a
matter,
a
restraint,
the
kind
of
speech
involved,
whether
restraint
is
within
the
source
of
restraint
should
be
barred
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
if
i
have
--
failed
to
heed
my
teacher,
i
have
four
students
indeed.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
--
that
is
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
it
is
not
in
my
guiding
light
in
this
case,
i
assure
you.
it
would
have
been
easier,
much
easier
matter
to
say,
“saturday
has
all
that's
been
considered
outside
the
constitution
of
basis,
no
first
amendment
problems
can
sit
down.”
we
don't
--
we
think
that
there
are
problems
that
must
be
considered.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
believe
you
have
to
take
the
statute
as
it
has
been
generally
construed
and
you
can
take
it
as
--
in
--
as
construed
in
--
i
think
in
this
case.
i
think
if
the
charge
were
in
gross
error
and
they
have
said
any
book
contains
the
dirty
sentence
you
don't
like,
you
can
convict.
i
believe
this
court
would
be
within
its
--
then,
the
limited
question
to
reverse
and
say,
“the
statute
is
so
construed,”
was
invalid.
the
--
if
i
may
trespass
on
your
--
your
generous
question
is
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
the
--
i
don't
think
that
the
edge
of
the
first
amendment
is
razor
sharp.
but
if
we
took
a
--
the
motion
picture
film
which
take
the
kind
of
series
of
pictures
taken
at
one-sixteenth
of
a
second
apart
running
from
a
legitimate
photograph
of
a
couple
into
yet
an
engagement,
perverted
conduct
if
anything
obscene
that
is.
i
don't
think
you
can
say
the
first
amendment
is
right
between
these
two
pictures.
i
think
that
the
--
the
--
well,
the
pictures
obscene
depends
on
the
whole
balancing
process
of
what
the
idea
is.
you
have
to
consider
if
it's
a
dirty
picture,
partly
dirty,
somewhat
dirty
and
this
is
not
the
first
amendment.
i
don't
think
my
analysis,
our
analysis
here
is
that
speech
raises
constitutional
questions.
now,
a
billboard
being
put
back
from
a
highway,
it's
speech.
they
want
to
have
a
safety
slogan
they
put
up
on
a
new
highway.
the
county
says,
“no
billboards
on
this
highway.”
now,
that
to
say
this
is
not
--
doesn't
raise
first
amendment
questions,
i
think
is
not
candid
and
there
was
an
effort
to
be
candid
with
this
court
that
we
went
at
such
length
to
say
that,
speech
which
is
obscene
raises
first
amendment
questions.
and
the
court
in
finding
out
whether
the
restraint,
the
violation
of
first
amendment
must
consider
the
extent
to
which
that
speech
partakes
of
the
ideas,
opinions,
political-economic
social
which
is
the
basis
of
the
first
amendment
in
an
extent
to
which
it
causes
the
injuries
which
society
has
properly
entitled
to
protect.
here,
the
protection,
it's
limited
to
declining,
to
carry
the
stuff,
carry
these
pictures
through
the
united
states
mail.
we
believe
that
whether
other
statutes
are
valid,
whether
a
public,
a
prohibition
on
publication
is
valid.
the
united
states
and
its
power
to
mail
can
properly
say,
“we
do
not
choose
to
carry
such
worthless
material.”
they
can
decide
as
to
circle
of
a
catalogue.
they
--
they
can
certainly
decide
it
--
i
say,
they
could
decide
as
this
catalogue.
they
can
decide
as
to
billboards,
large
signs,
we
don't
want
to
carry
those
things.
they
don't
have
enough
ideas
per
pound.
they're
not
worth
a
terra.
this
material
is
strongly
objected
to
by
society,
not
even
majority,
almost
unanimous
group
of
society.
this
--
this
matter
is
vile
and
considered
so.
in
this
case,
you
must
assume
it
to
be
obscene.
united
states
government
submits
the
statute
which
has
been
valid
so
long,
considered
valid
so
long
which
is
not
been
deemed
to
raise
constitutional
questions.
heretofore,
on
its
face,
is
a
valid
exercise,
postal
power
invade
the
federal
government
by
the
constitution.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
just
wanted
to
make
this
last
point
--
