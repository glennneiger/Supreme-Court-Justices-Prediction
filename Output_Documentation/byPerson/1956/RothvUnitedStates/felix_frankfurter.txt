justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
plan?
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
don't
understand.
do
you
mean
to
say
that
while
it's
unconstitutional
to
prohibit
stuffs
from
going
through
the
mail,
there
is
no
redress
against
the
post
master
general
directing
the
postal
officials
not
to
deliver
such
a
mail?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
--
the
webb
kenyon
act
has
no
such
absolute
non
possumus
that
you
find
in
the
first
amendment.
you
say
you
can't
deliver
this,
but
you
can
say
it's
all
right
that
you'll
just
stop.
you
can't
keep
this
out,
but
you
say
if
new
york
or
some
quasi-state
has
legislation
against
obscenity,
then
the
postmaster
general
says,
"never
mind
the
first
amendment,
you
deliver
it."
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
even
raise
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
states
can
tell
and
the
states
can
to
that
extent
tell
this
postmaster
general
to
disregard
the
first
amendment,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
they
may
ask
for
help,
but
there
is
no
first
amendment
which
through
your
understanding
is
an
absolute
iron,
inescapable
bond.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
--
what
if
--
if
a
--
as
i
say,
a
puritanical
state,
massachusetts
was
once
puritanical.
if
massachusetts
says,
"we
don't
like
this
kind
of
literature,"
then
the
postmaster
general
says,
"aye,
aye,
sir."
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
your
theory
--
your
theory
as
i
understand
it
disable
the
congress
from
protecting
if
that's
what
it
is,
the
citizens,
one
more
discrimination
against
the
inhabitants
of
the
district
of
columbia
including
myself.
congress
can't
do
anything
to
say
--
to
make
me
not
blush,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
they
can't
do
it
for
the
district.
the
district
is
--
congress
is
more
impotent
than
any
state
is,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
think
the
first
amendment
doesn't
limit
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
have
a
nice
(inaudible),
a
nice
great
equality
if
all
these
theories
have
woven
together.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
albrecht,
may
i
ask
you
whether
the
thing
you've
said
latterly
the
last
about
--
the
jury
didn't
read
it,
couldn't
have
read
it,
et
cetera?
are
any
of
those
questions
open
here?
i
just
looked
at
the
order
allowing
certiorari
and
that
was
very
nearly
restricted
to
the
point
you've
already
made,
namely
the
obscenity
statute
by
freedom
of
speech
in
the
first
amendment
by
due
process
clause,
the
obscenity
statute
and
it
violated
the
first,
ninth
and
tenth
amendment
reserved
to
the
states,
but
no
question
as
to
charged
adequacy
of
evidence,
submission
to
the
jury,
not
one
of
these
questions
is
opened.
there
are
three
very
specific
questions
taken
from
your
petition
on
the
basis
of
which
the
court
granted
certiorari
and
therefore
restricted
argument
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
care
with
the
government.
the
government
is
not
deciding
what's
the
scope
of
this
review
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
customary
isn't
it
when
counsel
want
to
raise
constitutionality
as
applied
that
they
say
so
and
the
court
says
so,
on
its
fate
and
apply
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can't
just
swim
in
the
midst
of
the
pacific
ocean
in
this
matter.
you
have
to
get
some
footing
on
some
terra
cotta
--
terra
firma.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
wasn't
this
statute
at
least.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
do
you
think
that
you're
discussing
this
thing
as
though
this
isn't
a
statute
by
the
congress
for
the
regulations
of
mails,
is
it?
that
doesn't
make
any
difference,
does
it
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
don't
you
talk
about
the
hecate
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
haven't
got
a
--
an
ordinary
obscenity
statute
here,
whatever
one
may
think
of
that.
is
that
a
statute
which
i
don't
know
how
it
is
a
100
years
to
begin
with,
certainly
more
than
a
hundred
years.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you've
got
here
a
question
of
regulating
the
mails.
am
i
to
assume
that
you're
going
to
argue
that
this
is
the
same
as
the
california
statute
or
any
other
obscenity
statute
subsequently
preceding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
only
confuses
me.
you
confuse
me
if
you
impliedly
equate
the
two.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
suggesting,
you
don't
have
to
follow
in
its
wake.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
is
a
--
i
--
this
is
a
particular
statute
and
not
at
large,
general
obscenity,
the
area
of
obscenity.
that
isn't
what
this
case
is
about,
necessarily
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
we
didn't
ask
the
government
just
to
discuss
all
alternative
statutes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
look,
mr.
fisher,
in
the
debate
which
was
held
the
other
day
in
the
house
of
congress
on
a
bill
like
this,
the
undersecretary
for
the
home
office
picks
up
a
distinguished
lawyer.
there's
a
continual
and
highly
lucrative
trafficking
of
pornography
and
that
until
he
had
--
well,
it's
his
duty
to
look
at
the
stuff,
he
quite
--
he
was
accustomed
to
it.
and
none
that
i
saw
as
it
were
--
for
the
(inaudible)
of
value,
but
paper
bags
as
they
were
sold
for
anything
up
to
7
pounds
a
piece.
in
the
course
of
the
proceedings
to
which
you
were
incurred
by
the
government,
was
there
any
evidence
appear
what
--
what
kind
of
a
market
there
is
in
this
country
for
these
things?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
this
is
--
this
is
stuff
that
appeared
in
evidence,
you're
now
saying
what
would
come
out
in
cases,
(voice
overlap).
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
indictment
for
obscenity
or
those
two
different
crimes
that
the
opinions
of
this
court
have
made
clear,
prosecution
for
obscenity
isn't
satisfied
by
approving
that
a
document
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
publication
was
filthy
or
vice
versa,
we're
talking
about
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
filthy
--
filthy
is
a
different
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
cause
of
action,
the
different
crimes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
be
frightened
by
that.
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
agree
it
must
have
an
effect
on
conduct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
we
know
it
doesn't
affect
conduct
in
the
future?
does
anybody
know?
has
psychology
reached
that,
wonderful
state
where
it
can
assure
us
that
if
boys
and
or
grown
ups
are
feebleminded
or
general
human
beings
have
certain
things
said
to
them
but
it
doesn't
do
anything
to
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
recall,
you
reached
that
--
one
of
certainty
of
--
of
determination?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
touch
conduct,
but
merely
a
fence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wonder
what
the
clear
and
present
danger
too.
justice
felix
frankfurter
clear
and
present
danger?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
you
think
this
has
to
be
shoved
into
that
category?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
statute
had
stood
for
50
years
before
the
phrase
“clear
and
present
danger,”
the
ink
of
that
phrase
was
dropped
from
justice
holmes'
4306.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
has
been
here
for
--
here
in
1877,
wasn't
it,
on
what
the
jackson
case
is
decided?
justice
felix
frankfurter
72.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
fisher,
would
regard
a
libel
in
the
district
of
columbia
if
congress
passes
a
statute,
making
it
a
criminal
libel
to
tell
lies,
demonstrable
untruth
about
a
public
man,
i
believe
there
is
such
a
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
an
infringement
of
freedom
of
speech
or
not
contained
within
it
as
the
further
abuse
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
think
it
does
make
a
difference.
it
does
make
a
difference
and
i
suggest
the
government
shouldn't
be
afraid
to
face
this
issue,
not
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
congress
can
violate
the
constitution
a
little
bit
or
the
constitution
doesn't
mean
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
all
the
difference
in
the
word
to
me
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
i
don't
think
we
can
violate
the
constitution
a
little
bit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
that
to
construe
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
libel?
is
that
within
the
constitution
or
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
--
i'm
not
talking
about
her
restraint
in
advance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
prosecution
for
libel.
is
that
a
violation
of
the
constitution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then,
why
do
you
have
to
worry
about
clear
and
present
danger
with
reference
to
a
libel?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
it
matters
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
libel
was
an
exception
or
was
the
--
or
the
violation
of
the
constitution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
clear?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
talk
about
the
alien
sedition
laws
in
gross
or
in
wholesale?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
what
that
means.
i
think
it's
not
very
brave
for
the
government
to
be
dodging
the
question.
“well,
if
this
is
a
violation
of
the
constitution
or
written
a
violation
of
the
constitution.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
not
you're
--
you're
afraid
of
touching
this
thing
whether
this
is
an
exception
or
a
little
restraint
which
the
constitution
forbids
or
to
say
a
court
right,
no.
it
is
not
within
the
prohibition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then,
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
clear
and
present
danger.
justice
felix
frankfurter
look
at
the
principal
explanation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suggest
that
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
i
suggest
it's
more
than
your
duty
in
trying
to
see
how
best
you
can
calculate
where
you
five
members
of
this
court.
i
don't
think
that's
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
chief
duty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
that's
your
question
only
when
you
got,
if
i
may
say
so,
if
you've
got
a
statute
that's
been
on
the
books,
the
constitutionality
of
which
has
been
passed
on
by
this
court.
i
think
your
first
duty
is
to
say,
“this
--
the
government
come
before
this
court
to
sustain
the
validity
of
a
statute
on
the
basis
of
which
all
sorts
of
people
have
been
put
into
jail.
in
which
the
most
eminent
and
the
leaders
in
liberal
court
have
sustained
its
constitutionality
and
we
go
on
from
there,
not
to
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
timid
about
it,
not
to
be
timid
about
it.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
charge
--
is
the
charge
before
us,
mr.
fisher?
is
the
validity
of
a
charge
before
us
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rogge,
since
you're
quoting
a
dissenting
opinion
of
mr.
justice
holmes,
they
never
strike
at
my
achilles
heel,
including
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suggest
that
as
--
i
suggest
there's
another
dissenting
opinion
on
which
i
suppose
you
would
rely
which
you
do
not
cite
in
your
brief.
i
refer
you
to
leach
against
carlile,
in
258,
u.s.
where
mr.
justice
holmes
says
the
--
very
much
in
your
favor
that
you
might
make
use
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
258
u.s.138,
you
find
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
may
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
in
that
--
in
that
dissent,
he
suggested
that
the
court
reconsider
the
jackson
case
way
back
in
1872
and
i
should
suppose
that's
the
strength
of
your
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that's
the
same
thing
as
though
this
statute
was
passed
yesterday?
that
a
hundred
years
in
the
practice
of
the
court,
in
the
decisions
of
the
court,
recently
referred
to
in
passing
by
several
members
of
the
court,
who
have
rather
strong
views,
bordering
on
the
absent,
you
think
that
it
makes
no
difference
that
a
statute
has
been
on
the
statute
books
sustained
by
this
court
again
and
again
by
the
leaders
and
those
who
have
given
us
the
modern
law
of
civil
libel.
that
is
immaterial
that
we
discuss
this
thing
de
novo,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
agree
with
you
entirely,
but
before
determining
whether
it
is,
we
better
consider
what
has
been.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
do
with
ex
parte
jackson,
a
very
history
to
which
you
refer
the
abolitionist
debate
in
the
senate
and
the
vote
against
president
jackson's
proposals?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
all
that
it
dealt
with
in
that
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
prodded
out
as
though
it
was
a
novelty,
something
new
that
we've
heard.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
draws
the
conclusion
that
despite
the
evidence
of
the
men
who
made
those
feature
in
the
senate,
both
the
statesmen
and
jurors
had
rejected
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
of
course
it
doesn't
have
as
to
libel.
i
said
as
to
libeling
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
alien
and
sedition
laws
had
provisions
about
a
different
from
this
statute
as
night
from
day.
justice
felix
frankfurter
everything
that's
in
an
area
isn't
the
same.
