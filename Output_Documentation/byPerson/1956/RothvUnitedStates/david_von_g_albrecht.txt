mr.
david
von
g.
albrecht
my
name
is
albrecht
your
honor
mr.
david
von
g.
albrecht
the
complement
in
any
events,
i
would
like
to
reserve
10
minutes
of
my
time
for
conclusion
for
my
able
associate,
mr.
rogge
for
rebuttal.
you
honors,
i
rise
now
to
the
defense
of
samuel
roth,
an
unconventional
publisher
who
publishes
what
people
reject
today
and
perhaps
accept
tomorrow.
the
government
--
the
government
here
concedes
that
the
petitioner's
publications
are
as
they
say
borderline
entertainment
area
and
do
not
contain
commercial
black
market
pornography,
which
is
said
by
them
to
be
the
principal
objective
of
the
enforcers
of
the
act
1461
which
we
shall
refer
to
instead
of
to
its
general
title.
but
that,
your
honors,
is
little
service
to
my
petitioner
who
is
under
the
harsh
sentence
of
five
years
in
jail
and
a
$5000
fine.
and
i
contend
that
it
is
of
no
aid
to
the
court
who
is
confronted
--
which
is
confronted
with
a
statute
about
obscenity
if
we
discuss
pornography.
your
honors,
this
prosecution
arose
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
mr.
david
von
g.
albrecht
your
--
your
honors,
a
federal
statute
could
be
made
i
believe
so
narrow
in
construction
that
it
might
be
all
right,
but
our
contention
in
this
case
is
that
under
the
first
amendment
as
in
conjunction
with
the
ninth
and
tenth
amendment,
the
congress
has
no
power
at
all
to
do
anything
in
relation
to
speech
as
speech
itself
that
that
power
resides
exclusively
with
the
state
and
with
the
local
government.
once
congress
attempts
to
interfere
with
it,
it
goes
beyond
the
sacred
area
which
is
prohibited
to
congress
by
the
first
amendment
and
which
is
reserved
to
the
states
by
the
ninth
and
tenth
amendments.
mr.
david
von
g.
albrecht
your
honor,
i
am
not
here
to
defend
the
question
of
pornography
because
i
don't
really
know
what
pornography
here
is.
but
i
understand
that
the
government
here
has
put
in
sealed
exhibits
which
we
don't
know
anything
about,
which
we
have
never
seen,
which
are
here
for
your
honest
exclusive.
mr.
david
von
g.
albrecht
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
von
g.
albrecht
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
von
g.
albrecht
yes,
sir.
that
--
my
contention
is
that
you
cannot
do
anything
like
that
because
that
is
essentially
a
state
function.
it
belongs
to
the
local
community.
we
were
not
suppose
to
go
to
the
extreme
of
doing
anything
as
far
as
speech
is
concerned
where
only
speech
itself
is
concerned.
mr.
david
von
g.
albrecht
that
is
my
contention,
your
honor,
that
the
federal
government
under
the
ninth
and
tenth
amendments
has
absolutely
no
right
to
do
that
and
the
government
says,
"well,
we
were
--
we
are
going
to
have
48
different
and
distinct
rules
and
regulations
here.
we
will
have
47
because
new
mexico
has
no
obscene
statute.”
now,
that
is
--
that
is
all
right,
but
we
did
the
same
thing
in
other
cases
in
the
past.
in
1835,
when
we
have
the
abolitionist
and
its
erection,
abolitionist
movements,
congress
provided
for
punishment
at
that
time
and
then
they
provided
and
the
postmaster
general
instructed
each
postmaster
in
each
state
not
to
deliver
the
mail
to
any
state
which
had
a
rule
prohibiting
the
delivery
of
such
mail.
we
--
we're
not
going
to
stop
the
post
office
from
doing
anything
by
declaring
this
--
this
act
unconstitutional.
the
post
office
has
the
--
has
the
--
and
each
state
can
do
the
things
that
they
want
to
do
in
that
state.
now,
we
do
the
same
thing
in
--
mr.
david
von
g.
albrecht
if
the
--
if
there
is
a
state
law
--
mr.
david
von
g.
albrecht
--
which
prohibits
that,
yes,
your
honor.
you
--
you
are
doing
the
same
thing
in
the
webb
kenyon
cases
where
you
have
--
mr.
david
von
g.
albrecht
yes,
sir
because
--
mr.
david
von
g.
albrecht
--
the
first
amendment
says,
“you
shall
not
abridge
the
freedom
of
speech
or
the
press.”
the
ninth
and
tenth
reserves
it
to
the
states.
now,
the
state
has
that
right
to
do
that.
we
are
--
we
are
right
there
and
--
mr.
david
von
g.
albrecht
the
--
the
states
can
--
can
ask
the
federal
government
for
help
just
as
they
have
done
in
the
past.
mr.
david
von
g.
albrecht
as
far
--
as
far
as
the
first
amendment
is
concerned,
your
honor,
the
first
amendment
is
--
is
definite
and
inescapable.
that
is
true.
mr.
david
von
g.
albrecht
that's
right.
mr.
david
von
g.
albrecht
and
--
and
the
reason
for
that,
your
honor
and
the
reason
for
that,
i
don't
go
as
far
as
--
as
my
colleagues
previously
have
attempted
to
go.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
state
with
its
police
powers
has
the
right
to
do
these
things
which
the
federal
government
has
no
right
to
do.
mr.
david
von
g.
albrecht
yes,
sir.
the
congress
may
and
the
congress
does
that
thing
all
right,
but
the
lottery
is
not
a
part
of
the
first
amendment
because
we
say,
"you
shall
not
abridge
the
freedom
of
speech."
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
first
amendment
that
says
anything
about
abridging
a
lottery.
mr.
david
von
g.
albrecht
well,
your
--
your
--
mr.
david
von
g.
albrecht
no,
congress
has
--
has
a
power
in
the
district
of
columbia
which
has
--
it
does
not
have
in
the
states.
mr.
david
von
g.
albrecht
your
honor,
i
don't
go
as
far
as
my
previous
colleagues
as
to
that
--
as
to
that
particular
point.
mr.
david
von
g.
albrecht
if
i
--
if
i
may
indicate
about
this
prosecution
that
was
started
in
the
federal
district
court
in
new
york.
it
consisted
of
an
indictment
which
contained
26
counts,
which
charged
this
defendant
with
wrongfully
depositing
for
mailing
several
articles
in
violation
of
section
1461.
the
case
came
up
in
--
on
january
3rd,
1956
and
was
concluded
nine
days
later.
out
of
those
26
counts,
three
were
either
dismissed
with
the
consent
or
of
the
government
or
upon
motion.
and
of
the
23
that
went
to
the
jury,
they
found
this
defendant
guilty
of
only
four.
and
of
the
four
counts,
there
were
only
seven
witnesses
as
against
the
36
that
had
originally
been
called
to
the
stand
and
there
were
numerous
exhibits.
mr.
david
von
g.
albrecht
which
your
honors
have
here.
and
one
of
the
books
upon
which
this
defendant
was
found
guilty,
consisted
of
over
200
pages.
this
book
was
never
read
to
the
jury.
only
isolated
parts
were
read
to
the
jury.
there
was
only
one
copy
that
went
into
the
jury
room
and
this
length
of
time
that
the
jury
deliberated,
it
was
a
physical
impossibility
for
the
jury
to
have
read
that
book
in
the
jury
room.
it
is
our
contention
that
--
that
if
they
had
read
the
book,
they
would
not
have
found
the
book
obscene.
if
your
honors
decide
to
read
it,
i
have
it
here
and
we'll
produce
it.
the
book
taken
as
a
whole
consisted
of
literary
works
of
(inaudible),
historical
works
and
a
short
story
by
aubrey
beardsley.
and
the
thing
that
was
important
to
the
jury
i
believe
in
that
case
was
that
they
took
this
book,
this
little
--
i
should
say
20
pages
by
aubrey
beardsley
and
inserted
and
they
had
a
book
which
is
a
criticism
of
aubrey
beardsley
by
a
man
haldane
macfall,
who
i
believe
was
not
even
alive
at
the
time
that
aubrey
beardsley
died
and
they
introduced
this
book
in
to
evidence
to
show
that
beardsley
believed
that
this
book
was
obscene.
mr.
david
von
g.
albrecht
well,
your
honor,
the
--
in
--
in
the
brief
supplied
by
the
government,
they
too
admit
that
i
have
this
right
and
i
refer
to
--
mr.
david
von
g.
albrecht
yes,
your
honor.
as
i
understand
it,
the
review
on
the
consideration
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statutes
not
only
applies
to
the
statute
on
its
face
but
also
as
applied.
and
therefore
i
--
i
thought
that
that
would
come
within
the
scope
of
this
argument.
mr.
david
von
g.
albrecht
well,
the
--
mr.
david
von
g.
albrecht
i
--
i
assume
the
implication,
your
honor,
because
i
take
the
--
that
the
review
includes
a
consideration
of
the
constitutionality,
not
only
the
space
of
the
statute
but
also
as
they
apply
it.
but
if
your
honors
think
that
i
have
gone
beyond
the
--
the
--
my
limits,
i
will
back
away
and
go
ahead
along
with
a
different
line.
mr.
david
von
g.
albrecht
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
von
g.
albrecht
if
--
if
we
may
your
honor,
and
in
the
short
time
allowed
to
go
on
and
i
would
like
to
quote
a
statement
made
by
perhaps
the
greatest
living
and
most
respected
writer
on
the
subject
today.
a
man
who
wrote
the
amicus
brief
here,
mr.
morris
ernst
and
he
says
in
his
works
that
the
federal
government
has
no
authority
of
the
local
morals.
there
is
no
federal
power
to
control
marriage,
divorce,
adultery,
or
bigamy.
these
matters
concerned
local
government
and
the
ninth
and
tenth
amendments
affirm
the
state
power
over
those
matters
and
no
power
as
delegated
to
congress.
now,
as
i
see
the
question
for
the
first
time,
this
court
is
being
asked
to
determine
whether
a
federal
criminal
statute
can
punish
speech
as
speech,
even
though
that
speech
has
no
connection
with
any
action
of
conduct
over
which
the
federal
government
has
power
or
control.
and
if
i
may
pose
this
question,
how
can
you
have
a
single
federal
criminal
statute
which
has
the
inherent
potential
of
having
different
results
in
different
states
that
upon
the
same
state
of
facts?
how
can
you
have
a
publication
found
to
have
been
violated
by
--
in
new
york
and
not
to
have
been
violated
in
new
mexico?
if
you
have
one
federal
criminal
statute,
we
can
have
a
jury
in
new
york,
trying
roth
and
convict
him
and
a
jury
in
new
mexico
tries
roth
and
acquits
him.
now
you
have
the
same
statutes
and
you
have
--
you
--
you're
just
going
to
get
the
whole
theory
of
erie
against
tompkins
involved
in
a
criminal
law.
and
i
submit
that
such
potential
for
this
harmony
and
the
enforcement
of
a
federal
obscenity
statute
is
compelling
evidence
that
obscenity
is
a
proper
subject
for
the
state
and
not
for
the
federal
power.
thank
you.
