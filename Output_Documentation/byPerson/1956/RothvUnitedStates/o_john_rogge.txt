mr.
o.
john
rogge
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
i
begin
my
rebuttal,
may
i
call
to
the
court's
attention
a
telegram
which
my
co-counsel,
mr.
albrecht
received
from
other
co-counsel
in
the
case,
david
p.
siegel.
please
state
to
the
united
states
supreme
court
that
i
have
been
confined
to
my
bed
since
thursday
because
of
serious
illness
and
that
in
view
of
my
unexpected
absence
from
the
hearing,
i
request
15
days
time
to
serve
a
special
reply
brief
in
the
matter
of
samuel
roth.
david
p.
siegel.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
now,
the
next
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
to
be
sure
that
we're
talking
about
this
case.
government
counsel
fought
a
great
deal
about
pornography
and
in
their
brief
they
talked
about
hardcore
pornography,
whatever
that
may
mean.
and
mr.
justice
harlan,
you
asked
about
pictures
and
i
think
you
did
too,
mr.
justice
douglas.
i
think
the
government
will
concede
that
they're
not
talking
about
the
evidence
in
this
case.
if
there's
any
doubt
on
that,
i'd
like
to
have
it
cleared
up
now.
the
government
is
talking
about
material
in
another
case
than
this
one.
i'd
also
like
to
spend
the
moment
on
the
scope
of
review.
the
review
was
very
specifically
set
out
here
in
three
questions,
relating
to
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
on
its
face
and
as
applied
under
the
first,
the
fifth,
the
ninth
and
tenth
amendments.
now,
the
government
in
its
brief
at
page
56
suggests,
under
the
limited
grant
of
certiorari,
it
is
to
be
taken
as
given
that
the
material
to
which
the
statute
was
construed
to
apply
is
likely
to
corrupt
the
morals
of
the
average
members
of
the
community.
so,
we
challenge
this
statement,
because
if
getting
to
--
getting
past
the
point,
i
first
say
that
when
the
first
amendment
says,
“congress
shall
pass
no
law,”
that's
just
what
it
meant.
but,
when
we
get
beyond
that,
if
we
get
to
the
clear
and
present
danger
test,
we
are
in
such
questions
as
what
is
the
substantive
evil
and
did
these
publications
have
a
probability
of
causing
it.
that
is
also
involved
within
the
scope
of
review
here.
now,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i'd
like
to
begin
with
your
question
as
to
whether
the
post
office
has
to
carry
the
material.
and
here
i
began
with
--
begin
with
the
statement
by
mr.
justice
holmes
in
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
brandeis
concurred
in
the
burleson
case,
a
dissenting
opinion
which
was
approved
by
this
court
in
hannegan
against
esquire.
mr.
justice
holmes
said,
“the
united
states
may
give
up
the
post
office
when
it
sees
fit,
but
while
it
carries
it
on
the
use
of
the
mails
is
almost
as
much
a
part
of
free
speech
as
the
right
to
use
our
tongues.”
and
if
we're
going
to
have
a
post
office
department,
it
has
to
carry
the
material.
and
if
i
have
to
refer
to
an
analogy
where
you
had
a
comparable
situation
in
the
corner
of
the
century
before
the
civil
war
broke
up,
there
was
on
the
statute
books,
an
act
of
1836,
which
specifically
made
it
a
penal
offense,
if
any
postmaster
should
unlawfully
detain
in
his
office
any
letter,
package,
pamphlet
or
newspaper
with
intent
to
prevent
the
arrival
and
delivery
of
the
same
to
the
person
or
persons
to
whom
such
letter,
package,
pamphlet
or
newspaper
maybe
addressed
or
directed.
that's
an
act
which
congress
passed
after
it
had
refused
to
enact
a
measure
for
which
president
jackson
called
in
december
1835,
for
barring
the
use
of
the
mails
incendiary
publications.
and
pursuant
to
that
statute,
you
had
rulings
both
by
the
attorney
general
and
also
by
the
postmaster
general
that
state
laws
obtain
supremacy
when
it
came
to
a
question
of
incendiary
publications.
in
1857,
the
united
states
attorney
general
cushing
ruled
that
a
mississippi
statute,
forbidding
delivery
of
incendiary
matter
was
not
in
conflict
with
the
federal
law
of
1836
and
no
postmaster
was
required
to
deliver
material,
the
design
and
pendency
of
which
you're
to
promote
insurrection.
now,
i
would
say
to
your
honor,
that
the
postmaster
general
has
to
carry
the
material
because
the
first
amendment
said,
“congress
shall
make
no
law.”
now
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
the
court
approves
that
in
hannegen
against
esquire.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
now,
you
ask
--
i'm
--
i'm
sorry
that
i
don't
have
that
additional
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
i
am
familiar
with
the
citation
if
your
honor
please,
but
i
have
not
reread
it
in
connection
with
this.
i
try
to
be
as
much
of
a
scholar
as
i
can,
but
time
limits
which
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
--
require
briefs
to
be
filed
in
particular
periods
of
time
don't
always
leave
one
that
much
time.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
well,
i
had
assumed
that
when
this
court
granted
certiorari
on
the
three
questions
of
whether
the
federal
obscenity
statute
involved
here
was
in
violation
of
the
first,
the
fifth,
the
ninth
and
tenth
amendments,
this
court
was
going
to
reconsider
that
statute,
although
it's
been
on
the
books
for
over
three
quarters
of
a
century
and
has
been
assumed
to
be
constitutional
at
times,
but
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
if
this
statute
as
i
submitted
is,
is
in
violation
of
the
first,
the
fifth,
the
ninth
and
tenth
amendments,
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
if
it's
been
on
there
for
a
150
years.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
on
the
points
in
which
we
raise
in
this
brief
has
not
been
squarely
argued
and
considered
by
this
court
and
i
think
you
should
do
so
now.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
ex
parte
jackson
involved
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
ex
--
what
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
well,
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
that
case
dealt
with
a
lottery
and
it
was
in
the
course
of
that
that
the
court
makes
the
point
and
quotes
the
congressional
history
on
the
defeat
of
president
jackson's
proposal
for
prohibiting
the
use
of
the
mails,
the
so-called
incendiary
literature.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
i
submit,
if
the
court
please,
that
on
the
first
two
major
occasions,
which
involved
statutes
aimed
at
speech,
namely
at
the
time
of
the
sedition
act
of
1798
and
again
in
1835
and
1836,
when
the
congress
was
considering
the
passage
of
the
law
that
president
jackson
asked
for
against
what
in
old
days
were
called
incendiary
publications.
when
we
are
dealing
with
periods
of
time,
where
we're
involved
with
the
framers
of
the
constitution
and
the
bill
of
rights
and
we
are
involved
with
their
first
descendants,
men
who
were
in
their
youth
at
the
time
of
the
bill
of
rights
would
passed
on
those
first
two
great
occasions,
when
the
question
arose
as
to
whether
the
united
states
could
--
whether
the
congress
could
pass
a
law
involving
speech,
they
stood
up
and
said,
“no.”
and
to
come
to
your
honor's
question
as
to
libel,
i
submit
that
the
united
--
that
the
congress
does
not
have
the
power
to
pass
a
law
relating
to
libel.
this
was
specifically
what
was
involved
in
the
sedition
act
of
1798,
and
both
madison
and
jefferson.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
they're
in
the
first
amendment
area,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
now,
i
want
to
address
myself
for
a
moment
to
the
point
that
mr.
justice
douglas
raised.
and
in
this
connection,
i
want
to
draw
distinction
between
the
dennis
case
and
this
case.
at
least
in
the
dennis
case,
you
had
a
statute
namely
the
smith
act,
which
made
it
a
crime
to
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
where
is
there
any
statute
in
this
case
defining
the
substantive
evil?
where
is
their
in
this
case
any
statute
which
says
that
anyone
who
uses
the
mail
for
the
purpose
of
inciting
people
to
immorality?
i
doubt
whether
it
would
be
constitutional,
but
where
is
there
the
very
basis
for
beginning
in
this
case?
you
have
no
statute
here
as
in
the
dennis
case
which
defines
the
substantive
evil.
and
beyond
that,
you
have
no
proof
that
the
defendant's
publications
could
bring
about
any
such
substantive
evil.
now,
lacking
those
two
things,
i
had
assumed
that
originally
that
the
question
which
in
a
shorthand
wary
of
--
referred
to
as
the
clear
and
present
danger
test,
was
the
question
for
the
jury
under
the
pierce
case,
but
under
the
dennis
case,
the
court
passes
on
that.
but
there
wasn't
even
any
basis
on
that
approach
for
the
court
to
allow
this
case
to
go
to
the
jury.
now,
the
government
referred
to
various
cases
such
as
taking,
falls
off
in
the
park
and
various
other
things
which
i
submit
were
nothing
more
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
--
mr.
chief
justice.
these
references
by
the
government
to
such
incidence
relate
to
local
breaches
of
the
peace
and
would
be
handled
in
that
way.
in
other
words,
if
a
man
gets
up
in
the
public
park
and
takes
his
clothes
off
and
people
gather,
i
assume
this
would
be
a
breach
of
the
peace
and
would
be
handled
in
that
way.
it
wouldn't
involve
a
first
amendment
question.
i
--
since
i
--
since
mr.
chief
justice,
you
gave
me
five
more
minutes,
i
will
take
another
minute
to
make
another
point.
we
assume
in
these
whole
area
that
somehow
or
other,
publications
are
going
to
cause
sexual
or
other
delinquency.
the
truth
of
the
matter
is,
we
don't
know.
as
judge
fuld
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
kingsley
books
against
brown
pointed
out
in
a
footnote,
he
said
it
is
noteworthy
that
studies
are
for
the
first
time
being
made
through
such
scientific
skills
does
exist
concerning
the
impact
of
the
obscene
in
riding
some
other
mass
media
on
the
minds
and
behavior
of
men,
women
and
children.
we
haven't
had
them
up
to
this
point.
and
for
professor
walter
gellhorn
suggests
on
the
contrary
that
rather
than
publications
leading
to
such
kind
of
conduct,
he
suggests
the
aristotelian
theory
that
maybe
it
acts
as
a
catharsis
and
will
keep
people
from
engaging
in
the
kind
of
conduct
that
society
is
afraid
of.
i
submit
where
we're
in
an
area
in
the
first
place
where
we
really
don't
know
about
the
impact
of
publications.
and
where
on
the
contrary,
there
is
substantial
psychological
authority
to
the
effect
that
maybe
it's
on
the
good
side
rather
that
on
the
bad,
which
is
also
born
out
by
the
study
of
the
book,
namely,
delinquents
don't
read.
on
the
contrary
they
have
reading
difficulties.
when
you
take
all
these
up,
even
if
you
are
going
into
the
clear
and
present
danger
area
and
i
submit
that
the
first
amendment
means
just
what
it
says
and
was
so
held,
namely,
congress
will
make
no
law,
but
if
we
get
in
to
that
area,
you
at
least
should
have
some
basis
somewhere
for
saying
this
is
the
substantive
evil
and
these
publications
have
the
probability
for
bringing
them
about
and
you
don't
even
have
that.
thank
you.
