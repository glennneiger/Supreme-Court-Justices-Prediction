what
definition
of
obscenity
do
you
want
us
to
endorse?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
there
are
a
lot
of
other
things
that
made
you
skip
it
over
like,
does
it
--
and
to
stir
sexual
impulses?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
might
take
off
the
stage
long
opinions
that
sir
george
bernard
shaw
wrote.
justice
william
o.
douglas
there's
another
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
on
the
--
just
before
the
--
about
the
middle
of
page
26,
you
may
ask
yourself,
"does
it
offend
the
common
conscience
of
the
community
by
presentation
(inaudible)?"
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
the
(voice

--
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
admission
of
obscenity
before
the
court,
i
gather
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
was
that
--
do
you
even
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
maintain
that
that
is
obscene
which
offends
the
common
conscience
of
the
community?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that's
one
sentence
and
out
of
the
--
out
of
many
paragraphs.
justice
william
o.
douglas
we're
--
we're
talking
about
obscene
here
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
this
is
the
best
that
as
i'm
talking
about
are
--
relate
to
obscenity.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
suppose
they
could
have
convicted
this
fellow,
i
don't
--
i
haven't
seen
the
literature,
but
i
suppose
under
this
charge
they
could
have
convicted
him
if
what
he
published
intended
to
stir
sexual
impulses.
justice
william
o.
douglas
if
the
government
is
not
taking
the
position
or
is
it
that
the
--
that
the
clear
and
present
danger
test
has
any
relevancy
here
to
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
(voice
overlap)
--
we're
--
we're
dealing
here
with
speech
and
utterance
of
ideas
and
--
there's
always
been
the
probability
or
the
possibility
or
that
the
ideas
would
produce
some
kind
of
action
in
the
--
as
i
read
our
clear
and
present
danger
cases.
justice
william
o.
douglas
clear
and
present
danger
that
you'll
be
shocked,
clear
and
present
or
what?
clear
and
present
danger
or
what?
justice
william
o.
douglas
this
sounds
like
a
--
like
mr.
comstocks
here
that
he
can't
stop.
justice
william
o.
douglas
there
were
two
other
bases
of
the
clear
and
present
danger
used.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
question
has
never
been
here,
really.
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
say
that
congress
can
make
some
laws
that
abridge
freedom
of
speech?
justice
william
o.
douglas
you're
talking
now
just
about
pictures,
not
about
the
text.
justice
william
o.
douglas
do
you
think
dealing
with
sedition
law
is
constitutional?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
we
have
a
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
we've
got
a
specific
charge
here.
