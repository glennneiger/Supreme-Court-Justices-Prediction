mr.
irons?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you,
while
the
general
statute,
relative
to
corporations,
venue
as
to
corporations
apply
solely
as
to
corporations,
is
there
not
still
a
broader
purpose
though
in
the
special
patent
venue
statute
applicable
to
natural
persons
as
well?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so,
it
would
not
be
true
to
say
that
the
special
patent
venue
statute
serves
no
purpose.
that
would
be
true
only
as
respects
to
corporate
defendants,
wouldn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
