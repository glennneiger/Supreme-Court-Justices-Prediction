mr.
w.
r.
hulbert
may
it
please
the
court.
i
could
not
disagree
more
completely
to
what
my
brother
said.
and
i
was
trained
in
a
law
firm
under
a
--
an
old
timer
who
--
when
i
came
in
with
a
half-baked
interpretation
of
some
statute
which
i
found
in
a
case,
he
told
me
to
read
the
statute
before
i
arrive
at
any
further
erroneous
conclusions.
now,
i
think
it
is
most
helpful
if
first,
we
look
and
see
what
this
statute
is,
that
we
are
talking
about,
that's
been
classified
by
mr.
irons
as
a
special
statute
and
it
is
perfectly
true
and
we
do
not
quarrel
with
his
contention
that
the
predecessor
statute
was
a
special
statute.
and
as
a
special
statute,
it
was
susceptible
to
the
interpretation,
which
this
court
gave
it
in
the
stonite
case.
but
this
1948
codification
and
revision
and
this
court
has
indicated
that
it
contains
many
revisions
and
many
changes
in
the
law.
the
particular
chapter
here
involved
is
called
chapter
87,
district
court's
venue,
and
i
--
for
convenience,
i'm
referring
to
the
west
publishing
company
pamphlet,
which
contains
all
the
sections
of
this
chapter
in
a
single
place.
from
there,
we
find
a
chapter
containing
16
sections.
the
first
section
of
which
is
section
1391
and
it
is
--
it
is
subsection
(c)
of
section
1391,
which
is
the
first
section
we
are
considering
and
that
is
the
section,
which
says
that
a
corporation
maybe
sued
in
any
district
in
which
it
is
incorporated
or
licensed
to
the
business
and
so
on.
now,
in
addition,
that
is
the
first
section
and
purports
to
my
mind,
at
least,
to
be
a
definition
which
is
to
be
applied
when
the
remaining
sections
of
this
chapter
are
read.
now,
we
proceed
with
the
remaining
sections.
mr.
w.
r.
hulbert
well,
that
is
the
--
mr.
w.
r.
hulbert
that
is
the
conclusion
i
reach,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
w.
r.
hulbert
that
is
my
contention.
mr.
w.
r.
hulbert
i
didn't
intend
to
do
that,
your
honor.
but
one
of
my
reasons
for
so
stating
is
that
looking
at
the
remaining
sections,
we
find
that
1393,
which
has
to
do
with
divisions
and
defendants
in
different
divisions
uses
the
term
“where
he
resides”
and
that's
in
subsection
(a)
and
subsection
(b).
again,
you
come
back
to
the
word
--
against
defendants
residing
in
different
districts.”
in
section
1396,
having
to
do
with
internal
revenue
taxes,
another
--
shall
we
say
special
venue
section,
in
the
district
of
a
taxpayer's
residence,
section
1397,
having
to
do
with
interpleader,
where
the
claimants
reside.
section
1398,
interstate
commerce
commission
orders
wherein
as
the
residence
or
principal
office
of
any
of
the
parties
bringing
the
action,
section
1400,
"patents
and
copyrights."
the
first
subsection
(a)
has
to
do
with
copyrights
where
the
defendant
or
his
agent
resides.
subsection
(b)
is
the
one,
which
has
already
been
discussed
at
length.
section
1402,
the
united
states
as
a
defendant,
maybe
brought
where
the
plaintiff
resides.
again,
subsection
(b),
where
the
plaintiff
resides.
now,
i
submit
that
on
the
very
face
of
this
chapter,
we
have
at
the
beginning
of
it
a
definition
of
a
word
which
is
then
used
apparently
as
a
word
of
art
in
the
various
subsections
and
we
come
--
and
we
come
to
the
subsection
or
the
section
relating
to
patents
and
copyrights.
we
find
that
word
used
just
as
it
has
been
used
in
the
other
sections
and
without
any
hint
or
suggestion
on
the
face
of
the
act,
that
it
has
to
be
given
a
different
meaning.
mr.
w.
r.
hulbert
of
course,
it
is
not
to
be
disregarded,
your
honor.
but
if
the
plain
words
of
the
statute
make
a
change,
then
we
say
that
there
is
no
reason
to
have
recourse
to
the
history.
of
course,
the
history
is
important
in
any
event.
now,
the
court
below
stated
in
its
opinion
that
nothing
could
be
plainer
as
a
matter
of
words
than
reading
subsection
(b)
of
section
1400.
the
suit
--
this
suit
was
authorized
to
be
brought
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
now,
is
there
some
reason
--
some
compelling
reason
why
this
plain
language
should
not
be
given
effect?
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
this
case,
there
is
no
--
there
has
got
--
there
is
no
great
argument
of
policy,
no
great
injustice,
which
will
be
done
or
--
or
great
irrational
result
which
would
be
reached
by
deciding
this
case
either
way.
but
as
a
--
but
i
think
to
decide
it,
the
way
mr.
irons
has
contended,
introduced
us
more
incongruities
and
makes
it
less
rational
than
to
decide
it
in
a
way
i
contend
it.
the
first
thing
on
the
very
face
of
the
act,
it
has
been
done
as
i've
already
just
stated,
is
to
give
the
word
“resides”
in
a
section,
which
is
just
part
of
a
chapter
of
any
sections,
a
different
meaning
from
the
meaning
that
has
been
given
in
all
the
other
sections
apparently.
so,
turning
to
the
revisers'
notes,
there,
mr.
irons
has
also
contended
that
these
notes
plainly,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
state
that
what
congress
intended
to
do
was
to
make
this
section
1400
(b)
mean
the
same
thing
as
the
predecessor
statute.
now,
that
i
cannot
follow
and
i
think
referring,
your
honors,
to
the
revisers'
notes,
i
can
show
that
this
is
not
necessarily
so
because
--
and
here,
i
refer
to
the
congressional
pamphlet
which
both
sides
have
referred
to
extensively
in
their
briefs
and
which
is
a
convenient
summary
of
the
reviser's
notes
having
to
do
with
this
codification.
section
--
under
section
1391,
the
reviser's
first
list
of
the
sections
of
the
prior
law,
which
they
were
revising
and
codifying
and
they
mentioned
that
the
word
“reside”
was
substituted
for,
where
of
he
is
an
inhabitant
for
clarity
in
as
much
as
inhabitant
and
resident
are
synonymous.
now,
this
--
in
this
section
1391,
they
had
just
placed
in
the
law
the
definition
that
a
corporation
resides
or
its
residence
is
where
it
is
doing
business
or
includes
the
place
where
it's
doing
business.
when
we
come
to
section
1400,
the
note
made
by
the
revisers
refer
this
back
to
section
1391,
where
they
had
just
given
the
definition
with
respect
to
a
corporation
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
“residence.”
so,
i
submit
that
nothing
could
be
plainer
that
they
did
change
the
law.
they
meant
--
mr.
w.
r.
hulbert
well,
i
think
it
is
ambiguous
and
furthermore,
it
is
possible
they
had
in
mind
what
was
referred
to
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
earlier
of
the
change
of
law
with
respect
to
corporations
generally
in
the
international
shoe
case.
they
didn't
mention
that
case,
but
as
judge
albert
said
in
the
denis
case,
which
we
referred
to
in
massachusetts,
in
the
district
of
massachusetts.
if
the
notes
are
less
--
are
more
ambiguous
in
the
statute,
there's
no
point
in
referring
to
the
notes.
mr.
w.
r.
hulbert
the
only
thing
that
it
could
be
ambiguous
is
if
you
look
behind
it
and
read
the
cases
which
they
then
sight.
you'll
find
that
inhabitant
made,
in
some
of
those
cases
at
least,
was
found
to
mean
the
place
of
incorporation
whereas
--
mr.
w.
r.
hulbert
no
--
mr.
w.
r.
hulbert
--
they
did
not,
your
honor.
no.
mr.
w.
r.
hulbert
i
do.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
r.
hulbert
i
don't
know
what
was
in
their
mind,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
r.
hulbert
refer
to
the
notes.
mr.
w.
r.
hulbert
all
i
can
say
is
--
on
that,
your
honor,
that
they
had
just
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
chapter
or
even
right
in
that
part
where
they
are
discussing
it
under
1391,
given
a
definition
of
residence
of
a
corporation.
and
then,
they
proceeded
to
use
that
word
and
stated
that
residence
and
inhabitant
meant
the
same
thing.
why
they
cited
those
cases,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
w.
r.
hulbert
one
of
the
answers
to
that,
your
honor,
i
think
is
found
in
the
--
in
the
history
of
patent
venue
which
mr.
irons
did
not
go
into
and
which
we
have
dealt
with
rather
at
length
in
our
brief
because
we
feel
it
is
an
argument
which
was
not
brought
before
this
court
in
the
stonite
case.
mr.
w.
r.
hulbert
i
do
not
believe
it
is
necessary
to
reconsider
stonite,
your
honor,
because
we
were
dealing
with
a
different
statute
at
that
time
in
which
the
general
venue
provision
was
very
clearly
dependent
onto
a
--
a
--
the
first
general
venue
provision
whereas
the
patent
venue
statute
was
an
entirely
--
it
was
entirely
apart.
it
was
a
single
part.
mr.
w.
r.
hulbert
yes
and
--
mr.
w.
r.
hulbert
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
they
did
more
than
that
and
that
they
assembled
in
one
place,
the
different
specials,
acts
and
statutes
relating
to
venue.
and
at
the
very
beginning,
they
defined
the
term,
which
you
will
find
used
in
most
to
those
sections
but
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
w.
r.
hulbert
i
have
another
--
mr.
w.
r.
hulbert
i
think
that's
being
fair.
yes,
sir,
but
i
have
still
another
strong
point,
which
has
not
yet
been
mentioned
today.
and
that
is,
i
believe
and
i
submit,
that
we
have
shown
that
the
history
of
patent
venue
is
in
accord
with
a
liberal
interpretation
of
this
section
because
of
the
change
of
this
word.
and
we
go
back
to
the
act
of
1887,
which
was
a
restrictive
general
venue
provision.
prior
to
1887,
suits
might
be
brought
against
persons
where
they
were
found
among
other
places.
and
in
1887,
because
of
abuses
and
these
are
the
abuses,
which
congress
had
in
mind
which
we
show
from
the
history
of
the
1887
act
of
what
--
what
was
said
in
contemporary
decisions.
the
abuses
which
the
congress
had
in
mind
were
under
this
general
venue
provision
and
it
was
not
--
and
when
that
was
passed
in
a
very
restrictive
way,
it
was
only
after
the
(inaudible)
case,
which
we
referred
to
in
our
brief,
where
--
in
order
to
avoid
a
perfectly
absurd
result
that
a
citizen
would
--
would
not
have
any
district
in
which
he
could
sue
an
alien
for
patent
infringement.
this
court
held
that
the
general
venue
statute
of
1887
did
not
apply
to
patent
cases
--
applied
to
cases
arising
under
the
law
of
the
united
states
where
a
citizen
was
suing
an
alien
especially
for
patent
infringement.
now,
that
was
necessary
because
there
would
be
no
part
in
which
such
a
suit
could
be
brought
if
the
1887
act
were
interpreted
as
applying.
then,
the
1897
act
which
provided
for
--
for
the
first
time
specifically
for
venue
and
patent
cases,
there
is
no
hint
or
suggestion
that
we
can
find
in
the
actual
history.
and
at
this
point,
i
might
mention
the
bowers
case,
which
has
already
have
been
mentioned
where
the
--
the
court
referred
to
the
supposed
abuses,
which
had
the
reason
in
patent
cases.
we
don't
know
where
the
judge
got
that
idea
because
we
did
not
find
it
in
the
actual
history.
mr.
w.
r.
hulbert
the
bowers
case,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
r.
hulbert
i
don't
have
to
know,
your
honor.
judge
schatz.
mr.
w.
r.
hulbert
perhaps,
there
were
abuses,
which
were
known
locally,
but
at
least
--
mr.
w.
r.
hulbert
not
in
boston,
your
honor.[laughs]
but
the
--
the
pertinent
legislative
history,
particularly,
the
statements
which
were
made
on
the
floor
of
congress,
both
the
senate
and
the
house,
is
to
why
the
special
act
of
1897
was
being
passed
did
not
refer
to
abuses
relating
to
any
unrestricted
venue
in
patent
cases.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
abuses
which
they
referred
to
were
because
of
a
supposed
restricted
venue
and
we
find
such
statements
as
the
fact
that
business
is
going
west
and
the
--
the
congress
was
afraid
that
--
that
eastern
businesses,
eastern
corporations
would
be
committing
infringing
acts
injuring
perspective
plaintiffs
out
in
the
west
and
that
those
complainants
would
be
unable
to
bring
suit
of
where
they
were
being
injured.
and
for
the
reason,
the
patent
--
the
patent
venue
section
of
1897
was
broader.
it
was
being
purposely
made
broader
than
venue
general.
now,
it
is
our
contention
of
that
in
codifying
the
law
in
1948,
particularly,
having
reference
to
the
philosophy
of
the
international
shoe
and
other
cases
that
the
revisers
must
have
had
in
mind
that
the
corporations
now
should
again
be
subject
to
suit
for
patent
infringement
on
at
least
its
broader
basis
as
defendants
generally
in
other
cases.
and
i,
particularly,
wish
to
call
this
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
this
history,
which
i
have
just
mentioned,
was
not
at
least
to
brought
--
it
was
not
brought
to
the
attention
of
this
court
in
the
briefs
in
the
stonite
case.
and
possibly,
the
stonite
decision
might
have
been
different
if
that
had
been
done.
turning
to
the
next
point,
it
has
been
repeatedly
stated
by
my
brother
that
this
1948
act
constitutes
a
codification
and
as
such
any
statute
in
it
which
has
a
predecessor
statute
should
be
construed
in
the
same
way.
now,
i
would
call
this
court's
attention
to
a
number
of
decisions
which
are
in
our
brief
indicating
that
many
courts
in
construing
this
act
had
many
time
stated
that
it
is
more
of
a
mere
codification
but
a
revision
and
contains
many
changes,
not
the
list
of
which
was
the
change
are
made
in
section
1391
(c)
itself,
corporate
venue
generally
using
the
definition
of
residence
which
was
an
important
change
and
which
went
beyond
the
way
reduction
in
the
neirbo
case.
now,
that
change
was
not
reflected
in
the
revisers'
notes
and
that's
just
one
of
many.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
are
some
indication
that
the
revisers'
notes
while
purporting
to
point
out
every
physical
change,
that
is
change
of
wording
and
text,
by
no
means
are
purported
to
point
out
all
changes
of
meaning
in
substance.
mr.
w.
r.
hulbert
the
revisers
were
a
committee,
i
believe,
appointed
by
this
court.
mr.
w.
r.
hulbert
no.
mr.
w.
r.
hulbert
oh,
well,
they
did
the
job
--
physical
job
but
i
understand
that
they
collected
a
great
deal
of
information
and
comments
and
suggestions
from
the
bench
and
the
bar
generally.
mr.
w.
r.
hulbert
that
may
be
so,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
r.
hulbert
no,
sir.
mr.
w.
r.
hulbert
yes
sir.
now,
the
lawson
case
was
mentioned
as
authority
for
not
construing
the
section
--
section
1400
(b)
as
we
suggest
that
it
should
be
construed.
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
lawson
case
is
clearly
distinguishable.
this
was
a
case
involving
a
second
accident
to
a
person
who
had
been
injured
and
an
interpretation
of
the
word
“disability”
in
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
a
mechanical
reading
of
the
definition,
which
had
previously
been
given
of
the
word
“disability”
resulted
in
--
in
making
very
poor
sense
out
of
the
section
in
question
and
secondly,
defeated
an
apparent
major
purpose
of
congress
in
passing
the
act
as
was
reflected
by
some
of
the
comments
in
the
hearing
on
the
bill.
and
finally,
i
would
like
to
reiterate
that
using
the
definitions,
which
has
been
given
in
this
codification,
in
this
section
rather
in
this
chapter,
we
arrived
at
a
result
which
it
makes
perfect
sense
logically,
which
produces
no
great
inequity
and
which
makes
the
whole
chapter
involving
the
other
special
sections
on
venue
to
read
as
a
logical
hole.
i
would
say
there
would
be
ample
reason
to
resort
to
twisting
words
out
of
their
apparent
meaning
as
given
in
--
in
a
definition
if
some
illogical,
unreasonable
or
oppressive
result
would
be
reach.
now,
but
here,
i
think
a
very
beneficial
result
can
be
reached
in
applying
a
broader
venue
with
respect
to
patent
infringers
having
in
mind
the
transfer
provisions
of
section
1404,
which
are
clearly
--
which
are
clearly
new
in
the
code
and
which
make
provision
for
a
transfer
of
patent
litigation
cases
from
any
district
in
which
they
were
brought
oppressively
to
a
district
which
is
more
convenient
for
the
parties
and
the
witnesses.
and
read
with
the
transfer
of
provisions,
i
submit
that
section
1400
(b)
that
makes
perfect
sense
in
reading
it
and
using
the
definition
and
which
is
provided
in
the
first
part
of
the
chapter.
