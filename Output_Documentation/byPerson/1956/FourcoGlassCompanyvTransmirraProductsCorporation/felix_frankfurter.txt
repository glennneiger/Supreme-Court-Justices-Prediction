justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
interrupt
to
ask
you
whether
the
difficulties
referred
to
created
by
the
1887
act
were
difficulties
peculiar
to
patent
or
whether
the
general
difficulties
about
residents,
inhabitants
and
all
that
business?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
covered
the
whole
area
of
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
--
or
the
complaint
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
not
having
a
restrictive
venue
more
numerous?
justice
felix
frankfurter
an
inhabitant
roughly
meant
incorporated?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
practical,
the
--
let's
see
what
the
reality
of
this
problem
is.
you
contend
that
suit
maybe
brought
in
any
federal
district
in
which
the
corporation
does
business
in
the
sense
in
which
this
court
has
now
held
doing
business
means
in
the
international
shoe
case,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
i
mean
that
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
you
are
urged
to
ask
the
respondent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
--
you
rejected
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
held.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
division
is
between
those
who
say
wherever
--
wherever
the
corporation
does
business
in
the
international
shoe
sense,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
never
mind
whether
it's
incorporated
in
that
state.
never
mind
whether
an
infringement
took
place
there.
and
that's
an
allowable
venue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
contrary,
the
contention
is
that
the
1897
act
persists.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
position,
namely,
either
you
must
sue
where
the
corporation
has
its
home
where
it's
chartered
or
whether
infringement
took
place?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
you
carved
and
that
the
specialized
venue
provision
of
the
1897
continues
and
isn't
absorbed
by
or
extended
by,
whichever
where
you
want
to
look
at
it,
by
the
general
venue
provision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
fair
to
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
--
i
mean
is
it
fairly
accurate
to
state
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
the
infringes
normally
that
overwhelmingly
be
the
corporate
infringes
or
is
that
to
do
this
as
well?
i
don't
know
if
it
had
any
relevance.
i
just
want
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
one
can
take
notice
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
didn't
understand
that
that
was
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
understand
that
was
the
argument.
i
understood
the
argument
was
that
the
generality
of
the
venue
statute
has
been
qualified
by
the
limited
patent
venue
provision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
whichever
you
will
have.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was
addressing
myself
to
your
suggestion
that
it
all
turns
on
the
word
“reside”
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
rather
than,
if
you
have
no
patents
--
suppose
you
have
no
special
patent
venue
statute,
no
venue
statute,
specifically
directed
towards
patent
litigation,
then
the
general
venue
statute
was
governed,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
we
had
done
that
in
stonite,
the
result
would
have
been
the
opposite
of
stonite,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
continue
to
say
substitution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suggest
its
absorption.
it
isn't
merely
that
we
abstracly
define
that
you
--
that
this
case
requires
us
to
define
reside
in
a
particular
way.
as
i
understand
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
--
this
court
of
appeals
and
based
on
other
judges,
it
means
that
the
general
venue
statute
is
incorporated
into
the
patent
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
it
isn't
merely
a
question
of
interpreting
a
word
in
the
special
patent
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
justice
clark
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
quite
candid.
he
said
that
insertion,
in
other
words,
you
--
you
read
the
special
patent
statute
by
--
with
the
annotation
of
--
or
what
i
call
the
absorption
into
by
infiltration
of
the
general
venue
statute.
it's
merely
a
question
of
how
the
problem
is
stated
which
may
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
it
isn't
as
though
we
had
an
independent,
as
though
we
had
only
this
patent
venue
provision
to
call
upon
to
construe
it
as
a
self-contained
provision
of
law,
but
the
clark
opinion
and
the
other
opinions
that
hold
that
say
is
that
you
shouldn't
cut
down.
i
know
you
understood
it
the
other
way.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
shouldn't
cut
down
the
generality
of
venue
by
the
specific
provisions
as
to
patent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
by
stating
their
position,
i
don't
mean
to
agree
with
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
no
longer
true,
is
it?
that
is
no
longer
true,
meaning
by
that
as
we
--
since
--
since
international
shoe,
which
came
later
and
still
later
cases,
now
allow
venue
that
you
brought
in
the
state
of
doing
business,
don't
they,
as
to
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
haven't
we
carried
--
haven't
we
carried
--
hasn't
this
court
carried
what
was
decided
in
the
matter
of
due
process
in
the
international
shoe?
haven't
we
carried
that
over
to
non-due
process
situations?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
the
recent
case
in
the
seventh
circuit
who
came
here.
i
forgot
what
the
name
of
that
case,
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
be
good
enough
to
indicate
what
situations
would
be
covered
by
the
general
--
what
situations
would
not
be
covered
by
the
general
venue
statute
if
you
didn't
have
a
particular
patent
venue
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
does
--
what
situations
does
the
special
venue
statute
authorize
that
would
not
allow
the
same
kind
of
suit
that
--
that
we
had
only
the
general
venue
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
put
it
this
way.
is
there
any
--
could
you
bring
any
suit
that
you
may
now
bring
under
the
special
venue
--
patent
venue
statute
that
couldn't
be
brought
in
the
district,
in
the
same
district,
in
which
you
will
bring
it
under
special
statute
if
that
had
been
repealed
and
congress
had
left
nearly
a
general
venue
statute
for
all
litigation
in
the
federal
courts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
the
situations
now
whether
the
infringer
either
has
his
home
incorporated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
he
commits
an
act
of
infringement,
but
how
about
doing
business?
can
you
do
business
in
a
district
in
which
the
corporation
is
either
incorporated
of
the
state
in
which
neither
incorporated,
nor
that
the
infringement
constituting
the
doing
of
business?
justice
felix
frankfurter
judgment.
now,
suppose
you
--
you
have
no
specific
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
couldn't
be
sued,
could
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
the
general
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
under
the
special
statute,
you
could
only
be
--
you
could
be
sued
where
you
infringed
and
you
could
be
sued
in
--
what's
your
home
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
west
virginia.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
could
be
sued
in
--
in
your
chartering
state
and
where
you
infringed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you
have
a
--
say
a
vacancy
in
new
york,
you
couldn't
be
sued
under
the
general
--
you
could
be
sued
under
the
general
statute,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
the
general
statute
gives
you
a
wider
range
but
doesn't
exclude
anything
that
you
now
have
under
the
special
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
can
--
you
can
start
out
with
that
as
a
postulate
without
begging
the
whole
question.
did
you
say
that
1391
is
to
be
read
into
all
the
provisions
that
follow
and
then,
of
course,
as
an
end
of
the
matter?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
that's
what
this
controversy
is
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
very
well,
but
you
can't
start
out
by
saying
that's
the
definition
statute
and
therefore,
it
must
be
read
into
everything
that
follows.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i
--
we're
listening
to
you
with
interest
but
i
don't
want
to
have
the
conclusion
stated
by
way
of
compulsion
at
the
beginning.
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
that
every
statute
is
--
a
statute
that
has
a
history,
the
history
is
not
to
be
disregarded.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
hulbert,
what
worries
me
is
that
that
mode
of
dealing
with
this
problem
leads
out
the
central
what
to
me
is
the
central
fact,
namely,
that
good,
bad
or
indifferent
reasons,
would
be
enough
for
me
to
inquire.
the
congress
thought
--
in
1391,
it
was
efficiently
first
clothed
that
separate
treatment
is
required
to
patent
litigation.
now,
what
you're
saying
is
that
that
motive,
that
purpose,
that
aim
of
congress
summarily
evaporated
except
to
the
limited
class
of
individual
infringes
that
would
remain
as
to
whom
1391
would
still
have
application.
and
at
that
point,
i
draw
on
my
knowledge
that
most
infringement
of
corporations,
wasn't
it?
i
mean
1400.
that
14
--
that
--
that
--
for
some
good
reasons
which
we've
dealt
with
in
the
initial
case,
the
congress
thought
patent
litigation
should
be
differently
dealt
with
and
carve
it
out
and
it
continued
to
carve
it
out.
and
you
practically
--
the
construction
of
the
court
below
and
of
judges
are
go
with
this
difficulty
i
have
with
the
case,
the
problem
is
the
eminent
judges
for
whom
i
have
great
respect,
very
great
respect,
some
of
them
in
dissent
in
other
circuits
who
held
otherwise.
but
what
i
can't
rid
my
mind
and
certainly
ready
to
have
it
ridden
by
--
with,
that
here
were
the
special
venue
statute,
a
special
venue
statute
directly
toward
this
type
of
litigation,
which
congress
continued
and
which,
if
the
construction
of
the
court
below
is
to
prevail,
would
have
a
consumptive
infringement
frontally
almost
obliterated
effect.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you're
asking
us
to
reconsider
stonite,
i
--
i
will
listen
with
more
understanding
to
the
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
physically
apart?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
the
1948
codification
is
merely
putting
things
--
making
things
more
tidy.
you
can't
out
of
that
to
my
point
of
view.
i
do
not
think
that's
the
way
to
construe
that
codification
that
it
made
--
made
the
changes
simply
by
bringing
cognitive
things
under
one
chapter
here.
that
was
not
--
when
one
--
when
one
thinks
about
it
and
have
some
knowledge
at
the
time,
i
mean
any
reflection,
but
the
manner
in
which
that
was
done
and
the
purpose
of
it.
the
kind
of
over
started
was
and
was
not
given.
i
don't
think
we
would
be
justified.
i
would
not
be
justified
going
drastic
differences,
the
drastic
changes
in
the
law,
typically,
law
of
jurisdictional
procedure
because
it
simply
made
the
law
more
tidy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
your
strong
point,
if
i
may
say
so,
but
i
do
not
think
it
answers
the
question
of
chief
justice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
long
side
of
it
would
be
to
revise
and
say,
“we
haven't
changed
the
word.”
if
the
word
inhabitant
has
been
left,
we
wouldn't
have
an
argument
and
they
say
resident
equals
inhabitant,
then
you
say,
“oh,
that
you
got
to
go
to
1391
to
find
what
type
of
residence
means
and
thereby
change
what
habitant
--
inhabitant
did
mean.
that's
being
fair
to
your
argument,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
was
that
case,
mr.
hulbert?
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
was
the
judge?
from
the
district
of
new
york,
who
was
the
judge?
was
it
brown,
(inaudible)
if
you
happen
to
know
him
--
don't
bother.
justice
felix
frankfurter
judge
schatz.
well,
those
are
--
those
men
on
the
southern
district
of
new
york
as
you
well
know,
knew
a
great
deal
about
patent
litigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
in
boston
clearly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
oh,
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
were
certainly
not
talking
about
any
glasses
of
congress
from
the
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
and
insofar
as
they
acted
on
the
--
on
the
proposed
code
with
the
--
with
the
notes
of
the
revisers.
