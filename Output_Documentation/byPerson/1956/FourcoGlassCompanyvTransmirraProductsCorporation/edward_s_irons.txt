mr.
edward
s.
irons
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
the
question
of
construction
of
the
special
patent
venue
statute,
section
1400
(b)
of
title
28.
the
petitioner
is
a
west
virginia
corporation
who
has
a
place
of
business
in
new
york
city
but
who
has
committed
no
acts
of
infringement
there.
the
respondent
is
a
new
york
corporation
and
owns
a
patent.
the
respondent
sued
the
petitioner
for
patent
infringement
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
the
petitioner
moved
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
that
the
venue
requirements
of
the
special
patent
venue
statute,
section
1400
(b),
were
not
satisfied
since
the
petitioner
was
not
a
new
york
corporation
and
had
not
infringed
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
the
district
court
granted
the
petition.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
this
court
granted
certiorari
in
view
of
the
conflict
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
with
contrary
decisions
of
other
circuits
on
the
same
question.
the
specific
question
with
respect
to
which
this
court
granted
certiorari
is
reproduced
on
page
2
of
the
respondent's
opening
brief,
the
light
(inaudible)
brief
and
is
whether
the
1948
revision
of
the
judicial
code
changes
the
law
and
enlarges
the
permissible
venue
for
patent
infringement
actions
against
corporate
as
distinguished
from
non-corporate
defendants.
to
permit
a
suit
against
the
corporation
in
a
judicial
district
where
the
corporation
has
not
infringed
and
is
not
incorporated
but
is
merely
doing
business.
in
the
consideration
of
this
question,
it
is
fundamental
initially
to
recognize
that
congress
in
the
1897,
as
a
matter
of
policy,
placed
patent
venue
in
a
special
category.
the
history
of
the
1897,
first
special
patent
venue
statute,
the
reasons
for
its
enactment
as
a
matter
of
policy
and
the
fact
that
by
such
policy,
patent
venue
was
placed
in
a
special
category
were
all
thoroughly
considered
by
this
court
in
stonite
against
melvin
lloyd
and
i
will,
therefore,
not
review
them
in
detail
here.
the
significant
ultimate
fact
as
this
court
noted
in
stonite
is,
"the
act
of
1897
was
adopted
to
define
the
exact
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
in
actions
to
enforce
patent
rights
and
thus,
eliminate
the
uncertainty
produced
by
conflicting
decisions
on
the
applicability
of
the
act
of
1887
as
amended
to
such
litigation."
that
purpose
indicates
that
congress
did
not
intend
the
act
of
1897
to
dovetail
with
the
general
provisions
relating
to
venue
in
civil
suits.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
answer
is
that
the
difficulties
were
particularly
oppressive
as
regards
to
patents
but
also
extended
to
other
areas.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
yes,
but
it
--
in
the
stonite
case,
this
court
referred
to
the
decision
in
bowers
against
atlantic.
i
will
just
read
one
sentence
from
that
decision.
it
said,
“the
purpose
of
the
act,”
referring
to
the
1887
act,
“was
to
narrow
federal
jurisdiction
and
it
may
be
inferred
that
congress
intended
to
limit
it
to
all
classes
of
actions,
infringement
suits
included
for
in
no
branch
were
complaints
of
injustice
and
oppression
more
numerous.”
that
is
in
no
branch
than
infringement
suit.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
yes.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
yes,
sir.
so,
with
this
thought
in
mind,
the
congress
enacted
the
first
special
patent
venue
statute
in
1897.
that
first
special
patent
venue
statute
is
reproduced
on
page
8
of
the
opposer's
opening
brief,
the
same
brief
that
i
called
your
honors
attention
to
previously.
and
it
is
significant
that
that
venue
provision
set
forth
to
--
mr.
edward
s.
irons
yes,
sir,
did
i
misspeak
myself?
i'm
sorry.
page
8
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
the
act
is
reproduced
on
top
of
that
page
and
as
will
appear,
it
specifies
two
alternative
venue
provisions.
it
states
that
in
suits
brought
for
the
infringement
of
letters
patent,
the
circuit
courts
of
the
united
states
shall
have
jurisdiction,
in
law
or
in
equity,
first,
in
the
district
of
which
the
defendant
is
an
inhabitant
or
second,
in
any
district
where
the
defendant,
whether
a
person,
partnership
or
corporation
shall
have
committed
acts
of
infringement
and
have
a
regular
and
established
place
of
business.
that
act
contained
a
commensurate
process
section
which
constitutes
the
second
sentence
of
it,
which
provides
that
if
the
suit
is
brought
in
the
district
in
which
the
defendant
is
not
an
inhabitant,
but
where
the
defendant
has
a
regular
and
established
place
of
business,
service
may
be
head
upon
the
agent's
conducting
the
business.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
as
there
can
be
no
question
at
that
time
as
far
as
corporations
are
concerned.
it
meant
state
of
incorporation,
yes,
sir.
the
act
of
--
mr.
edward
s.
irons
no,
sir,
that
is
what
the
respondent
contends.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
that
is
what
the
respondent
contends.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
yes,
sir.
that
is
the
contention
of
the
respondent.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
that
is
the
contention
of
the
respondent.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
i
rejected
it.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
that's
right.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
that
is
the
contention
of
--
mr.
edward
s.
irons
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
yes,
sir.
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
yes,
sir.
that
is
exactly
the
issue.
the
1897
act
was
recodified
in
1911
and
again
in
1926
without
material
change.
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
presently
effective
special
patent
venue
section
in
1948,
it
had
universally
been
construed
to
limit
venue
and
infringement
cases
against
corporate
defendants
to
the
state
of
incorporation
or
to
the
district
where
an
infringement
liability
had
been
created
and
not
to
extend
to
districts
where
the
corporation
was
merely
doing
business.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
i
agree
with
your
later
statement.
i
don't
think
it's
relevant.
i
see
no
reason
to
take
acknowledgement
or
not
to
take
notice
of
it.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
certainly.
now,
this
1897
act
which
was
recodified
as
1400
(b)
resulted
in
a
statute
which
in
terms
of
language
is
almost
identical
with
the
prior
law.
section
1400
(b)
is
reproduced
on
the
final
page
of
the
petitioner's
brief
and
i
think
it
well
to
look
at
it.
it's
the
second
quoted
statute
in
the
middle
of
that
page.
it's
page
38.
it
says,
“any
civil
action
for
patent
infringement
--
“
i
beg
your
pardon?
“any
civil
action
for
patent
infringement
may
be
brought
in
the
judicial
district
where
the
defendant
resides,
corresponding
to
the
first
alternative
of
the
old
act,
or
where
the
defendant
has
committed
acts
of
infringement
and
has
a
regular
and
established
place
of
business.”
it
will
be
observed.
the
language
here
is
almost
the
same
as
the
language
in
the
prior
act.
now,
we
come
to
the
crux
of
the
matter,
which
has
given
rise
to
the
controversy.
the
court
below
and
the
respondent's
contentions
all
boiled
down
to
the
argument
that
the
mere
substitution
of
the
word
“resides”
in
the
first
alternative
in
this
section
1400
(b),
for
the
word
“inhabitant”
which
was
used
in
the
prior
act
by
such
substitution,
they
contend
that
congress
has
effective,
a
fundamental
change
in
policy,
as
respects
patent
venue,
pursuant
to
which
patent
venue
is
changed
from
its
special
status
and
is
made
commensurate
with
venue
in
civil
cases
generally.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
particularly,
as
regards
to
corporate
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
well,
i
think
the
argument
is
better
stated
the
other
way.
the
special
provisions
of
the
patent
venue
statute
are
not
in
large
here
with
the
generality
of
the
corporate
statute.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
but
the
result,
your
honor,
is
this.
you
have
a
special
venue
statute,
which
has
existed
for
50
or
55
years
or
50
years
at
the
time
of
the
1948
recodification.
it
has
been
an
established
policy
of
congress.
three
times
reaffirmed
that
patent
venue
should
be
special.
now,
if
you,
in
graft
and
insert
into
this
act,
the
general
corporate
provisions,
you
don't
have
a
special
venue
statute
anymore.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
so,
the
policy
is
destroyed.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
well
--
mr.
edward
s.
irons
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
the
--
the
--
excuse
me,
the
court
below,
your
honor,
gave
lift
service
to
the
stonite
case
and
then
ignored
it.
i
will
read
to
you
exactly
what
the
court
below
said.
it
is
in
the
record,
page
--
i
think
the
opinion
begins
on
page
5
of
the
record
and
this
portion
of
it
is
on
page
6,
the
last
full
paragraph
on
page
6.
the
court
says
this,
"as
was
held
with
respect
to
earlier
litigation
--
mr.
edward
s.
irons
legislation.
“the
second
provision
should
control
here.”
that
is
the
special
patent
venue
statute,
which
is
quoted
up
there,
citing
stonite
as
its
authority,
which
is
quite
proper.
then,
the
court
continues,
"even
so,
that
requires
but
the
insertion
in
it
in
the
special
statute."
mr.
edward
s.
irons
that's
exactly
what
you
refused
to
do,
is
insert
in
the
special
patent
venue.
it
wasn't
this
particular
one.
it
was
the
one
where
the
--
the
--
it
was
now
1392
(a).
mr.
edward
s.
irons
yes,
sir,
in
1942
was
stonite.
this
court
acknowledged
stonite
and
then
did
exactly
what
the
mandate
of
stonite
forecloses.
it
inserted
into
the
special
patent
venue
statute,
the
general
venue
provisions.
and
as
we
shall
see
as
we
start
--
mr.
edward
s.
irons
yes,
sir.
now,
let
us
look
if
we
may
at
this
word,
the
substitution
of
words
and
as
you
will
see,
this
is
the
only
basis
which
these
respondents
have
in
support
of
their
contention
that
the
patent
venue
has
been
enlarged
by
1400
(b).
it's
this
substitution
of
reside
for
inhabitant.
what
did
reside
and
what
--
mr.
edward
s.
irons
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
that's
what
they
have
held.
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
well,
it
is
a
--
it
is
a
question.
i
would
suggest
determining
whether
congress
in
the
enactment
of
1400
(b)
intended
that
such
absorption
be
effective.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
all
right.
and
they
have
changed
that
congress
made
in
the
law
was
to
substitute
"resides"
for
"inhabitant."
that's
the
only
evidence
of
intent
that
has
any
real
--
that
--
that
is
worthy
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
s.
irons
--
of
discussion.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
yes,
sir,
all
right.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
surely.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
certainly,
that's
their
position
and
i
think
the
fallacy
they
fall
into,
if
i
may
say
so,
is
that
it
is
a
rather
well
established
doctrine
as
i
understand
it
that
successor
acts
are
presumed
to
be
perpetuate
the
prior
law
in
the
absence
of
evidence
to
the
contrary.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
i
understand
that,
but
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
you
have
to
get
there.
they
ignored
this
rule.
they
say,
“the
law
is
changed
unless
we
can
find
some
evidence
--
evidence
that
it
isn't.”
and
by
shifting
the
burden
of
proof
as
it
were,
we
have
to
presume
under
the
law
that
the
statute
was
not
changed,
unless
we
can
find
evidence
that
it
is.
this
people
can't
meet
these
lower
courts,
can't
meet
that
burden.
and
so,
they
say,
“unless
we
have
some
evidence
that
it
is
not
changed,
we
will
presume
that
it
has
been.”
that
is
how
they
reached
their
results.
i
don't
want
to
belabor
this
inhabitant
and
resides
business
to
the
point
of
annoyance,
but
i
would
like
to
say
two
more
things
about
it
because
it
is
going
to
become
repeatedly
important
in
the
consideration
of
this
case.
in
the
first
place,
inhabitant
and
resides
were
synonymous
when
this
act
was
passed
and
they
both
meant
domicile
and
they
both
meant
the
state
of
incorporation
as
far
as
corporate
--
corporation
defendants
are
concerned.
in
suttle
against
reich,
333
u.s.
163,
handed
down
in
1948,
this
court
said,
"the
residence
of
a
corporation
within
the
meaning
of
these
statutes
has
been
frequently
the
subject
of
consideration
by
this
court
for
over
half
a
century.
shortly
after
congress
enacted
article
51
of
the
judicial
code,
this
court
declared
that
the
residence
of
a
corporation
within
the
meaning
of
the
venue
statutes
is
only
the
state
and
district
in
which
it
has
been
incorporated."
this
statement
has
often
been
reaffirmed
by
this
court
with
some
change
of
phrase
but
always
retaining
the
idea
of
the
legal
existence,
the
home,
the
domicile,
the
habitat,
the
resident,
the
citizenship
of
the
corporation
can
only
be
in
the
state
by
which
it
was
created
for
almost
60
years
and
an
unbroken
line
of
decisions,
this
court
has
always
applied
the
same
construction.
now
--
mr.
edward
s.
irons
not
by
abrogation
of
--
of
the
rule
but
residence
and
inhabitant
are
synonymous,
your
honor.
now,
this
very
case,
one
of
the
cases
you
undoubtedly
have
in
mind
is
neirbo,
which
invoked
the
waiver
doctrine.
this
very
case
from
which
i
was
reading
says,
"nor
does
the
decision
of
this
court
in
neirbo
required
that
the
term
residence
be
construed
differently."
the
international
shoe
was
a
due
process
case
as
i
remember
in
which
the
--
the
issue
was
whether
or
not
the
due
process
was
satisfied
by
allowing
service
of
process
on
the
basis
of
a
salesman
who
would
travel
through
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
i
think
for
--
mr.
edward
s.
irons
i'm
not
familiar
with
it.
i
would
suggest
this
as
far
as
this
particular
case
is
concerned,
yes.
let's
concede
that
as
far
as
general
corporate
venue
is
concerned.
this
court
has
never
in
stonite's
decision
--
that
stonite
decision
of
this
court
squarely
ruled
against
in
any
such
enlargement
of
the
special
patent
venue.
i
have
one
more
comment
to
make
about
resident
and
i
will
then
say
no
more
about
it.
but
there
can
be
really
no
question
about
what
this
congress
had
in
mind
when
they
used
resident
in
1400
(b).
i
would
ask
the
court
to
refer
to
page
15
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
on
that
page
and
on
the
preceding
page
are
the
reviser's
notes
which
accompanied
1400
(b)
and
as
this
court
knows,
the
congress
was
particularly
careful
in
the
adoption
of
this
law
to
see
to
it
that
all
changes
were
reflected
in
these
notes.
this
court
has
even
said
that
these
notes
are
obviously
authoritative
in
perceiving
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
let
us
look
at
the
number
at
paragraph
4
on
page
15
of
the
brief
from
the
reviser's
notes.
it
says,
"words
in
subsection
(b),
where
the
defendant
resides,
were
substituted
for
of
which
the
defendant
is
an
inhabitant.”
a
corresponding
change
was
made
in
subsection
(a),
words
"inhabitant"
and
"resident"
as
respects
of
venue
are
synonymous
citing
a
note
under
1391,
which
says
the
same
thing
and
which
cites
three
united
states
supreme
court
cases
which
say
they
both
mean
domicile
and
as
to
corporations
mean
state
of
incorporation.
if
it
please
the
court,
this
patent
venue
section
1400
(b)
on
its
face
is
clear.
it
presents
no
problem.
it
means
exactly
what
the
prior
act
meant.
it
says
we
can
have
venue
where
the
defendant
resides.
that's
where
he's
domicile.
that's
what
the
old
act
says.
it
says
we
can
have
venue
where
he
has
a
place
of
business
and
where
he
has
infringed.
that's
what
the
old
act
said.
we
don't
have
any
trouble
with
this
statute
until
we
try
to
do
what
the
court
below
did
and
grabbed
the
bond,
the
general
venue
provisions
from
the
general
corporate
venue
law.
and
when
we
do
that,
we
have
a
great
deal
of
trouble.
just
by
way
of
introduction,
i
would
ask
the
court
to
look
again
at
the
final
page
of
our
opening
brief
where
the
statutes
are
reproduced.
the
final
statute
on
that
page
is
the
process
statute,
1694,
which
also
had
its
genesis
in
the
1897
act
and
is
now
been
recodified
separately
from
1400
(b).
it
says,
"any
patent
infringement
suit
commenced
in
a
district
where
the
defendant
is
not
a
resident,
not
a
resident,
but
has
a
regular
and
established
place
of
business,
service
or
process
may
be
head
upon
his
agent
or
agents
conducting
such
business."
i
feel
that
it
is
of
controlling
significance
insofar
as
trying
to
discern
what
the
scope
of
1400
(b)
was
intended
by
congress
to
be
that
this
process
section
expressly
recognizes
that
for
patent
infringement
cases,
the
mere
establishment
of
a
place
of
business
does
not
make
a
corporate
defendant
a
resident
of
that
district.
now,
this
is
one
of
the
minor
incongruities.
i
would
now
point
out
that
the
engrafting
on
this
special
patent
venue
statute
of
the
general
venue
provisions
completely
vitiates
it
as
a
special
venue
statute
and
as
a
venue
limitation.
in
this
respect,
i
think
it
is
perhaps
easiest
to
follow
the
result
if
we
look
at
the
statute
as
modified
in
the
way
in
which
the
defendants
would
have
it
or
the
respondents
would
have
it
modified.
i
would
ask
the
court
to
look
at
our
brief
on
page
21.
in
the
center
of
that
page,
we
have
reproduced
this
special
patent
venue
statute,
section
1400
(b).
and
having
grafted
upon
it,
the
provisions
of
the
general
venue
law
as
did
the
court
below
and
as
so
amended,
it
would
read
as
follows.
“any
civil
action
against
the
corporation
for
patent
infringement
may
be
brought
in
the
judicial
district
where
the
defendant
resides
to
wit
the
judicial
district
in
which
it
is
incorporated
or
licensed
to
do
business
or
is
doing
business
or
where
it
has
committed
acts
of
infringement
and
has
a
regular
and
established
place
of
business.”
it
seems
obvious
that
the
first
alternative
thus
reconstituted
becomes
abortive
as
a
venue
of
limitation,
as
a
definition
of
special
venue
in
light
of
1391
(c)
and
the
second
alternative
becomes
meaningless
and
surplusage
as
far
as
corporations
are
concerned.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
what
situations
would
not
be
covered
by
the
general
venue
statute
--
mr.
edward
s.
irons
i
don't
--
i
don't
conceive
of
any.
i
think
the
general
venue
statute
is
broader
in
all
respects
in
the
special.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
i
don't
conceive
of
any
--
any
such
case.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
now,
that's
exactly
our
case.
we
were
doing
business
in
new
york,
but
if
we
infringed,
we
did
it
in
west
virginia.
that's
why
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
granted
by
the
district
judge.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
we
could
be
sued
either
in
west
virginia
or
in
new
york
under
the
general
statute.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
west
virginia.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
it
happens
to
be
where
we
infringed.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
but
not
under
the
special
one,
unless
that's
sale
--
mr.
edward
s.
irons
that's
the
way
i
understand
this.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
yes,
sir?
mr.
edward
s.
irons
and
perhaps,
also
partnerships,
that
is
the
rationale
the
court
below
stated.
they
said
there
is
a
residue
of
utility
as
regards
to
partnerships
and
individuals.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
yes,
sir,
but
it
would
also
be
squarely
contrary
to
the
intent
of
congress
to
make
that
provision
apply
to
all
defendants.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
and
if
your
honor
will
bear
with
me,
i
would
invite
your
attention
to
the
petitioner's
opening
brief
on
pages
23
and
24.
this
is
important
and
i
think
that
you
will
be
interested
in
it.
this
court
below,
the
second
circuit
said,
“it
is
quite
clear
even
under
our
construction
that
this
provision
does
have
a
sphere
of
usefulness
against
non-corporate
defendants,”
and
which
is
what
you
have
suggested.
we
suggest
that
the
effect
of
this
decision
to
arbitrarily
restrict
the
utility
of
that
provision
to
non-corporate
defendants
is
in
the
teeth
of
the
intent
of
congress
as
reflected
by
the
reviser's
notes.
now,
on
--
in
the
reviser's
notes,
in
the
fifth
note,
it
says,
"words
whether
a
person,
partnership
or
corporation
which
follow
defendants
in
the
old
act
have
been
omitted
as
surplusage."
and
it
is
the
obvious
intent
of
congress
that
this
provision
extend
to
all
defendants.
this
is
just
another
of
the
incongruities
that
results
when
you
try
to
engraft
the
general
law
on
the
special
patent
venue
statute.
in
conclusion,
i
think
that
there
is
probably
an
outstanding
question
and
there
has
been
in
my
mind
how
did
these
lower
tribunals
reached
the
conclusions
they
reached.
why
did
they
fall
into
what
we
contend
to
be
the
error?
i
have
touched
on
that
question
briefly.
i
have
suggested
that
they
have
refused
to
follow
the
rules,
which
require
evidence
of
intent
to
change
the
law
and
have
assumed
that
it
was
changed
unless
they
can
find
some
evidence
of
intent
to
the
contrary.
the
rules
by
which
they
do
this
has
been
to
call
section
1391
(c),
a
definition
section,
which
it
clearly
is
not.
again,
if
we
may
refer
finally
to
the
last
page
of
the
petitioner's
brief
where
the
statute
is
reproduced
and
we
look
at
1391
(a)
and
1391
(b)
which
are
the
diversity
provisions.
those
are
the
only
provisions,
which
use
the
word
“resides”.
now,
in
the
reviser's
note,
accompanying
1391,
this
is
said,
"word
“reside”
was
substituted
for
--
were
obvious
an
inhabitant
for
clarity
in
as
much
as
inhabitant
and
resident
are
synonymous."
now,
if
the
court
please,
it
is
self
evident
that
in
1391
(a)
and
in
1391
(b),
resident,
like
it
does
in
1400
(b),
means
state
of
incorporation
or
domicile.
congress
having
reached
that
point
was
faced
with
the
proposition
that
as
to
corporate
venue
an
exception,
general
corporate
venue
an
exception
to
make
the
law
consistent
with
neirbo,
schlumberger,
gulf
oil,
had
to
be
enacted
and
so,
they
took
care
of
that
in
1391
(c).
1391
(c)
is
the
exception
on
the
general
venue
provision
to
make
it
consistent
with
the
law
as
it
existed
in
1948.
and
in
closing,
i
will
say
that
even
if
we
accept
this
contention
that
1391
(c)
is
a
definition
section.
this
respondent
cannot
prevail.
in
the
case
of
lawson
versus
suwannee
fruit
&
steamship
company
reproduced
on
--
in
part
of
32
of
our
brief,
this
court
held.
statutory
definitions
control
the
meaning
of
statutory
words,
of
course,
in
the
usual
case,
but
if
this
--
but
this
is
an
unusual
case.
if
we
read
the
definition
in
a.f.
1
in
a
mechanical
fashion,
we
create
obvious
incongruities
in
the
language
and
we
destroy
one
of
the
major
purposes
of
the
second
injury
provision.
we
have
concluded
that
congress
would
have
not
intended
such
a
result.
respondent's
argument
boils
down
to
the
contention
that
congress
destroyed
one
of
the
cornerstones
of
the
law
and
intended
to
codify.
that
argument
should
not
prevail.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
i
have,
sir,
very
brief
comments,
your
honor.
if
the
court
please,
i
think
in
the
first
place,
it
is
self
evident
why
those
decisions
where
cited
by
the
revisers'
notes
with
respect
to
the
substitution
of
an
evident
or
resident
or
conversely.
every
one
of
those
decisions,
say,
that
those
words
are
synonymous
because
they
mean
domicile
and
as
to
corporations,
they
mean
state
of
incorporation.
they
couldn't
have
been
more
explicit.
we
have
had
it
suggested
here
that
this
history
argument
based
on
the
history
of
the
1897
act,
somehow
or
another
should
lead
this
court
to
reach
a
different
result
than
it
did
in
stonite.
we
are
told
that
this
history
was
not
before
the
court
in
stonite.
the
fact
is
that
this
is
the
same
old
argument,
which
was
advanced
before
the
court
of
appeals
with
the
third
circuit
in
--
in
stonite.
it
was
on
that
argument
that
the
court
of
appeals
based
its
decision
and
this
court
reversed.
by
reference
to
page
4
of
our
reply
brief,
it
would
be
noted
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
stonite
stated
are
historical
review
that
revealed
that
congress
has
always
accorded
patent
litigants
a
broader
venue,
then
that
extended
to
other
civil
litigants.
in
light
of
this
history,
it
hardly
seems
like
it
that
congress
intended
by
the
act
of
1897
to
withdraw
from
patent
litigants
that
statewide
venue
and
had
accorded
from
the
beginning
to
all
others.
this
is
the
identical
argument
which
has
urged
on
you
again
today
and
which
was
rejected
in
the
stonite
case.
there
was
an
argument
made
that
some
significance
should
attach
to
the
fact
that
1400
(b)
and
1391
are
in
the
same
act,
so
same
argument
was
advanced
in
stonite.
this
court
said,
“the
reenactment
of
the
act
of
1897
as
section
48
and
r.s.
740
of
section
52
of
the
judicial
code
is
not
indicative
of
any
congressional
understanding
that
the
two
sections
are
complementary.
and
we
have
been
told
that
the
revisers
collected
a
lot
of
information
to
guide
congress
in
the
reenactment
of
the
law.
there
is
no
evidence
in
kind,
the
revisers
did
not
gather
any
information
on
the
reenactment
of
the
special
patent
venue
law.
it
was
reenacted
without
change.
the
only
comment
about
venue
that
we
have
been
able
to
find
in
the
revisers'
notes
is
in
the
house
report,
which
say,
“so
also,
minor
changes
were
made
in
the
provisions
regulating
the
venue
of
the
district
courts
to
clarify
ambiguities
and
reconcile
conflicts.”
these
are
reflected
in
the
revisers'
notes.
there
is
no
indication
in
the
revisers'
notes
of
any
change
in
venue
in
special
patent
cases.
