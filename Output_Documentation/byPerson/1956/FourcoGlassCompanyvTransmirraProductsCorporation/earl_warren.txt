mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
--
if
that
reviser's
note
doesn't
mean
what
mr.
irons
said,
what
does
it
mean?
you
say
it
doesn't
mean
when
he
say
it.
what
--
what
does
that
language
mean
that
i
think
why
did
they
put
up
there
that
--
that
the
two
words
are
synonymous?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
don't
see
the
ambiguity.
they
--
they
merely
say
that
the
two
words
are
synonymous
and
that's
why
they
used
“resident”
instead
of
“inhabitant.”
now,
what
is
the
--
what
is
it
ambiguous
about
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
cite
international
shoe
as
authority
for
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
reach
the
point?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
do.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
they
cite
it
in
other
cases,
why
wouldn't
they
cite
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
don't
either
and
i
thought
you
said
a
little
while
ago
that
we
--
we
should
read
the
statute
rather
than
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
the
situation
of
this
kind.
i
agree
with
you,
it's
pretty
good
thing
to
do,
but
what
does
it
mean?
what
can
it
mean
if
--
and
why
did
they
--
they
changed
it
from
resident
to
inhabitant
if
it
wasn't
because
they
say
that
the
two
words
were
synonymous?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you
mr.
hulbert.
mr.
irons,
do
you
have
anything
further?
