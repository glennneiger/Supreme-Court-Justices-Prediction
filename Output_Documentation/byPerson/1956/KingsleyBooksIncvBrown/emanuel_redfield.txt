mr.
emanuel
redfield
thank
you,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
some
appellants
who
are
appealing
from
a
judgment
in
a
civil
action,
which
enjoins
them
from
having
in
their
possession
for
the
purpose
of
sale
or
distribution
of
certain
books
called,
“nights
of
horror,”
consisting
of
14
different
volumes.
now,
this
injunction
proceeding
came
about
by
virtue
of
a
statute
of
the
state
of
new
york
known
as
section
22
(a)
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure,
which
is
set
forth
on
page
2
of
my
brief.
this
statute
was
enacted
in
1941
and
it
empowers
the
chief
executive
officer
of
a
town
or
city
or
its
chief
legal
officer
to
institute
an
action
in
his
name
to
restrain
publications,
which
are
obscene.
and
when
i
say
to
restrain
publications,
i
mean
to
restrain
persons
who
have
them
in
their
possession
for
the
purpose
of
sale
or
about
to
acquire
them
for
the
purpose
of
sale
or
distribution.
the
injunction
judgment
may
also
provide
under
the
statute
that
the
defendants
be
directed
to
surrender
of
--
the
books
to
the
sheriff
of
the
county
and
for
him
to
destroy
them.and
you
could
see
parenthetically
where
this
judgment
of
a
court
actually
becomes
one
of
book
burning.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
they
burn
them
usually.
i
--
i've
never
been
present
in
any
ceremony
and
give
a
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
no,
to
be
destroyed.
literally,
to
be
destroyed
but
actually
what
happen
is
they
--
they
burn
them
up.
now,
the
case
involves
a
legal
principle,
as
your
honors
see,
of
first
magnitude
because
this
was
a
principle
and
left
open
by
cases
up
to
now.
what
is
involved
here
is
not
criminal
prosecution
or
punishment
of
a
person
who
has
the
books
but
suppression
of
the
publication
itself.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
--
i
mean
in
its
limited
sense,
i
would
so
concede
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
that's
right.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
that's
the
only
issue
that
i'm
raising
in
this
case.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
don't
want
to
go
off
field.i
--
i
took
that
position
from
the
beginning
and
i
don't
want
to
take
another
position
now
out
of
fairness
with
the
court,
counsel
and
to
my
jurisdictional
statement.
and
i
also
would
like
to
add
parenthetically
that
i
have
here
an
amicus
brief
in
my
support
that
raises
further
questions
similar
to
the
ones
that
are
raised
in
this
alberts
case
and
in
the
roth
case,
question
of
vagueness
and
the
question
of
the
cause
of
connection
between
books
and
social
conduct.
i
do
not
--
well,
i
disassociate
myself
from
those
arguments
of
counsel
who
filed
that
amicus
brief
because
as
i
say,
out
of
pure
honesty,
i'd
better
stick
to
that
position
that
that
was
the
question
i
raised
from
the
beginning
and
that's
what
i'm
sticking
to
now.
and
just
like
the
attorney
in
near
case
to
bring
it
closer
--
judge
harlan,
in
near
case,
if
your
honor's
will
recall,
the
counsel
said,
“punish
near
for
what
he
did
but
do
not
suppress
his
books.”
well,
with
newspaper
and
that's
the
same
to
this
one
i'm
taking
here.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
sir.
that's
the
sole
question
that
i
am
raising
in
this
case.
now,
from
that
it
follows
that
what
is
at
stake
here
is
that
if
this
law
is
upheld,
why
--
you
could
sensor
motion
pictures,
newspapers
and
all
other
forms
of
communication.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
sir.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
i
was
going
to
come
to
that.
the
law
requires
the
--
let's
take
the
corporation
counsel
that
happened
here,
to
file
a
complaint
in
a
civil
action
alleging
that
these
books
that
he
is
complaining
about
are
obscene
in
--
with
all
the
other
synonymous
words.
and
therefore,
he
wants
the
court
to
adjudge
that
they
are
so
obscene
and
that
the
court
should
restrain
the
defendants
from
distributing
or
selling
these
books
or
acquiring
them
for
the
purpose
of
distribution.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
in
the
same
sense
as
a
motion
picture
would
be
physically
in
existence
and
the
question
would
be,
may
the
licensing
board
rule
whether
or
not
they
should
be
exerted
there?
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
well,
i
mean
i
--
i've
heard
that
you
mentioned
before,
that's
why
i'm
sensitive
to
it.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
as
to
whether
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
waive
and
stop.
i
mean
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
mean
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
as
long
as
you
raise
that
i
--
i
don't
want
to
leave
it.
you
have
the
question
then,
can
one
censor
something
that's
in
and
off
his
mind.
and
the
answer
is
no
because
nobody
knows
what's
in
his
mind.
so
it
has
to
be
reduced
to
some
manuscript.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
now
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
and
--
and
present
--
and
present
issues
of
that
type
but
yes.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
all
right.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
that's
this
case,
except
for
the
latter
part.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
except
for
the
latter.
but
the
first
part
--
i
mean
you
--
you
said
that
in
here
enjoin
them
from
distributing
what
they
had
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
so
what
happened
--
so
the
complaint
alleged
these
things
and
asked
that
the
court
enjoin
the
distribution
of
these
publications
and
to
direct
their
surrender
to
the
sheriff,
following
the
statute
almost
word
for
word.
now
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
pardon?
mr.
emanuel
redfield
what
was
done
next
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
right.
before
the
trial
--
this
is
the
important
point.
they
went
to
court
and
got
an
order
to
show
cause
for
a
temporary
injunction
as
permitted
under
new
york
general
equity
practice.
and
in
this
order,
it
was
incorporated
a
stay
pending
the
argument
of
the
temporary
injunction.
and
i
would
like
to
say
this
at
this
point
that
the
--
these
papers
were
temporary
injunction
are
not
made
part
of
the
record,
but
counsel
for
the
appellee
here,
on
page
7
of
his
brief,
admits
that
there
was
such
a
stay
in
the
application
for
a
temporary
injunction.
so
they
were
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
they
were
stay
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
oh,
the
--
these
appellants
were
stayed
from
selling,
distributing
or
acquiring
for
the
purpose
of
distributing
these
books.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
temporary
injunction.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
fine.
then
--
now,
the
application
for
a
temporary
injunction
was
heard
and
i
believe
the
attorney
at
that
time
consent
that
--
to
it
to
keep
things
in
status
quo.
he
consented
to
it.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
it
was
a
very
short
time.
i
don't
know
my
dates
offhand
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no,
four
or
five
days
or
something
of
that.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no,
until
--
until
the
order
of
show
cause
is
heard.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
few
days.
and
then,
a
temporary
injunction
was
granted.
subsequently,
the
case
take
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
--
i'm
about
to
say
that
after
a
trial,
sometime
before
christmas
of
that
year.
and
if
you
recall,
the
temporary
injunction
was
granted
in
september
and
the
trial
took
place
shortly
before
christmas.
after
deliberating
over
the
question,
despite
the
law
of
saying
that
judgments
have
to
be
made
within
two
days.
the
court
took
until,
i
think
subsequent
june
before
he
rendered
a
decision.
the
injunction
restrained
these
appellants
from
distributing,
selling
or
acquiring
possession
of
these
books.
it
held
the
volumes
to
be
obscene.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
and
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i'm
--
i'm
not
touching
that
point
at
all.
i'm
--
i
--
i
did
not
contest
it
from
the
beginning.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
and
in
that
action,
of
course,
i
raised
the
constitutional
questions
that
i'm
here
raising.
but
the
court
held
the
law
to
be
constitutional.
it
held
that
there
was
no
prior
restraint
involved
and
the
very
voluminous
opinion
written
seems
to
focus
its
attention
on
the
fact
that
these
books
were
so
bad
that
it
didn't
appeal
to
this
judge.
he
also
held
that
the
law
will
be
constitutional
because
no
prior
restraint
was
involved
in
that
by
analogy
to
certain
picketing
cases.
there
could
not
be
a
prior
restraint.
then
we
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york,
and
the
court
there
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
with
three
judges
siding
with
one
opinion
and
three
judges
with
another
opinion.
in
my
argument
as
i
stated
earlier,
the
only
issue
is
would
a
prior
restraint
by
this
injunctive
procedure.
in
attacking
this
problem,
for
the
moment,
i
have
to
omit
the
feature
of
obscenity,
i
will
come
to
that
and
if
i
don't
have
time
to
come
to
it,
it's
in
my
brief.
and
we
have
to
start
with
this.
what
is
the
effect
of
this
statute?
under
the
law
of
both
the
statute
and
the
general
equity
procedures
in
new
york,
a
stay
was
obtained,
a
temporary
injunction
was
granted
and
seizure
of
the
books
follows.
the
statute
therefore
in
effect,
and
that
is
the
important
element,
in
effect
operates
to
prevent
the
publication
from
reaching
the
public.
the
injunction
might
well
issue
before
the
books
are
even
bound,
if
they're
merely
being
printed
and
held
ready
for
distribution.
and
in
that
sense
the
advice
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
protecting
publications
from
suppression.
it
was
established
long
ago
in
this
court,
that
distribution
is
protected
as
well
as
publication.
the
(inaudible)
case
holds
that.
and
if
distribution
is
protected
as
well
as
publication,
then
i
don't
see
that
it
makes
any
difference
whether
or
not
this
book
is
directed
against
somebody
who
has
a
manuscript
only
or
whether
it's
directed
against
distribution.
in
both
cases
the
suppression
is
effectual.
the
books
cannot
reach
the
public.only
recently,
this
court
held
in
butler
against
michigan,
that
the
public's
interest
to
be
able
to
read
what
is
published
is
a
right
that
must
be
affirmed.
and
if
this
injunction
deprives
the
public
of
that
right,
it
well
comes
within
the
scope
of
that
butler
articulation.
now
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
i'm
--
i'm
very
happy
you
raised
that
because
i
thought
of
that
many
times.
but
i
would
say
things
should
be
reached
when
you
have
to
dispose
of
them.
this
is
not
that
case.
i
--
in
other
words,
if
i
were
defending
a
person
convicted
such
as
you
mention,
i
might
well
raise
at
that
time
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
court
make
--
i
mean
that
whoever
is
empowered,
whichever
public
officer
is
empowered
to
destroy,
may
be
violating
the
constitutional
rights
of
--
the
both,
the
public
to
read
and
also
of
the
person
who
owns
those
books.
but
i
say
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
--
that's
not
involved
here
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i'm
sorry.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
but
--
but
that's
not
involved
here
and
i
say
we
have
enough
difficulty
with
this
case
without
taking
on
additional
ones.
now,
this
brings
me
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
the
--
the
question
--
that
question,
however,
is
one
of
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
the
--
the
sale
of
it
is
sort
of
evidentiary
of
the
existence
of
these
books
for
the
purpose
of
sale.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
but
i
don't
think
it
will
make
any
difference
in
principle,
so
long
as
you
are
suppressing
the
book.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
sir.
that's
exactly
what
i
meant.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
now,
in
near
against
minnesota,
this
court
had
before
it
a
case
which
i
think
is
not
only
a
guide
but
as
an
authority
for
determination
of
this
case.
the
facts
are
almost
identical.
the
only
difference
being
that
in
near,
you
have
a
libel
situation,
whereas
here
one
of
obscenity.
in
near,
this
person
published
a
magazine
--
a
newspaper
--
a
weekly
newspaper
that
was
sought
to
be
enjoined
under
the
minnesota
statute,
comparable
in
every
way
to
this
one.
the
statute
enable
public
officer
to
go
into
court
and
get
an
injunction
against
the
distribution
of
any
publication,
present
or
future
on
the
ground
that
such
a
publication
was
a
public
nuisance.
and
the
public
nuisance
is
that
of
being
either
libelous
or
else
obscene.
and
this
court
voided
that
minnesota
statute,
so
far
as
it
applied
to
that
particular
issue.
the
issue
there
being
that
the
newspapers
were
very
libelous
and
they
were
certainly
were
very
libelous.
the
court
held
that
the
issue
there
was
not
punishment
of
near
but
rather
suppression.
and
chief
justice
hughes
for
review,
the
history
for
the
first
amendment
--
amendment,
concluded
that
the
first
amendment
was
enacted
for
just
that
situation.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i'm
coming
to
that.
well,
if
i
don't
have
a
chance
to
come
to
that,
i'd
like
to
take
the
opportunity
at
this
moment.
what
he
said
there,
if
you
recall,
was
not
well
articulated.
that
is,
he
didn't
treat
it
comprehensively.
it
was
just
one
of
those
passing
remarks.
it
was
not
based
upon
any
authority
under
the
constitution.
there
were
no
decisions
prior
thereto.
there
were
no
statutory
or
constitutional
provisions
covering
that
point.
he
just
made
that
remark
in
passing.
it
was
pure
dicta.
now,
what
he
said
there
is
obscure,
too,
because
whether
or
not
he
referred
to
criminal
prosecutions
or
referred
to
civil
suits,
is
not
made
clear.
therefore,
i
say
that
the
near
case,
so
far
as
obscenity
is
concerned,
cannot
be
deemed
the
authoritative.
all
that
was
involved
in
that
particular
case
were
these
libelous
newspapers.
and
i
dare
say,
that
if
one
were
given
the
choice
between
the
fulminations
of
newspapers
like
near's,
in
which
he
libeled
race,
people,
innumerable
public
officials
and
did
it
continuously,
if
one
were
to
give
a
choice
between
that
and
some
of
this
stuff
that
is
termed
obscene,
i'm
sure
that
there
are
many
people
who
would
think
that
the
obscene
were
a
lesser
evil,
for
the
reason
as
we
all
know
that
some
of
the
fulminations
that
appear
in
the
near
magazines
were
comparable
to
the
hitler
ranklings
that
resulted
in
about
six
million
people
dead.
now,
whether
obscene,
books
can
produce
six
million
dead,
i
don't
know.
but
certainly
when
you
have
social
conduct,
such
as
involved
in
near's
newspapers,
i
give
pause
as
to
which
social
evil
was
greater.
now
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
the
question
is
this
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
all
right.
but
you
come
and
let's
--
let's
--
it's
off
my
path
here
but
as
long
as
the
right
that
the
(inaudible)
case
in
which
you
took
particular
interest
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
was
one
of
criminal
prosecution
for
libeling
a
race
and
you
sustained
it
because
of
the
criminal
nature
of
it.
the
libel
being
criminal,
whereas
in
near,
there
was
libel
and
yet
the
civil
nature
of
it
saves
--
saved
the
near
from
--
from
the
--
being
condemned
by
injunction.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
when
it
comes
to
expressions,
yes.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no,
that's
right.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
that's
right
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
for
this
reason
that
in
criminal
cases,
you
have
a
right
to
a
jury
trial,
whereas,
what
do
you
have
in
a
case
like
this?
it's
the
--
it's
the
opinion
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
very
true.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
very
true.
so,
what
aid
would
you
have
in
deciding
whether
or
not
a
--
a
book
is
obscene?
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
with
all
due
respect,
i
--
i
might
say
this.
where
does
a
judge
get
expert
opinion
that
he
knows
more
than,
let's
say,
an
administrator's
official?
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
from
the
beginning
here.
i
mean,
it's
a
series
of
suppression
from
the
very
minute
that
the
order
of
show
cause
is
served.
now,
in
--
in
the
dissent
in
near
case,
the
dissenting
judges
took
the
position
that
because
there
was
a
court
that
was
rendering
judgment
and
not
an
administrative
official,
that
that
did
not
make
any
difference.
whereas
the
majority
did
see
the
difference
between
a
judge
--
no,
i'm
sorry,
i
should
say
this
that
the
--
the
majority
in
near,
felt
that
there
was
no
difference
between
a
judge
rendering
a
decision
and
an
administrative
official
rendering
a
decision.
that
in
both
cases
there
was
somebody
who
was
hearing
and
determining
what
should
be
done
with
these
publications.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
from
my
reading
of
the
cases
in
this
court,
i
didn't
see
that
there
was
any
difference
so
far
as
--
as
censorship
is
concerned
between
an
administrative
official
and
a
judicial
officer.
the
near
case
made
it
clear.
the
near
case
said
a
judge
can't
do
it.
and
later
on
in
cantwell
case
there
was
a
remark
to
that
effect
that
censorship
by
a
judiciary
is
a
--
is
as
of
noxious
to
the
constitution
as
censorship
by
an
--
an
administrative
official
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
that's
right.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
that's
right.
and
that's
what
i
have
done.
and
it
can't
--
it
can't
be
avoided.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
but
may
i
--
also
this
in
the
--
in
the
second
that
i
have
that
prior
censorship
in
the
mind
cannot
exist
because
you
can't
sense
of
something
in
a
person's
mind.
you've
got
to
have
it
in
some
tangible
form.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
sir.
