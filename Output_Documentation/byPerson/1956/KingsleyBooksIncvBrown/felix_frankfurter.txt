justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
redfield.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
care
--
consistent
with
your
purpose
with
the
argument
to
state
exactly
what
the
statute
required,
exactly
what
the
people
sought
here
and
exactly
what
the
judgment
is
which
you
are
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
asking
us
to
reverse.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
relating
to
books
that
are
already
physically
in
existence
and
have
been
what
is
called
publishing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
to
carry
you
in
that
(inaudible)
i
just
want
to
know
exactly
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
it
is
we're
dealing
with.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
isn't
that
the
fact?
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
me,
it
makes
a
lot
of
difference
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
whether
you
enjoin
publishing
something
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
writing
something
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
speaking
of
contract
to
give
up
--
to
give
a
manuscript.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
not
--
i
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
don't
let
me
take
you
off
the
track
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i'm
stating
what
happened
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
yes.
in
the
near
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
case,
they
tried
to
censor
all
two
--
admissions
of
that
paper.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know
but
his
point
is
that
they
said
because
you
published
a
lot
of
stuff,
which
we
think
are
reprehensive
--
is
reprehensible,
you
can't
disseminate
what
you
have
published
nor
can
you
in
the
future
publish
your
paper.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
for
the
future?
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
guilty
party,
mr.
redfield,
but
will
you
give
us
what
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
done
here
and
then
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
was
done
next?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
done
next?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
a
trial
on
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
stayed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
was
stayed?
i
don't
know
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pending
--
pending
the
hearing
on
the
temporary
injunction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
time
between
the
grant
of
the
stay
and
the
hearing
of
the
temporary
injunction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
it?
six
months
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
normal
thing
in
a
stay
on
a
temporary
injunction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
a
few
days?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
pause
--
if
i
may
say
so.
that
pause
is
just
where
legislation
comes
in.
if
we
have
to
fall
then
we
have
to
pause
and
the
and
the
agency
which
on
whole
seeks
to
express
what
social
policy
should
be
paid
its
role.
that's
what
they're
for.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
call
that
a
pause
it
doesn't
mean
that
they've
transcended
their
powers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wrote
the
opinion
in
that
case.[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
quite
mean
that.
if
you
do
not
mind
--
if
i
see
what
your
words
imply
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
the
--
the
power
of
a
legislature
to
impose
criminal
penalty
was
greater
than
to
deal
with
it
civilly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
really?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
turn
in
advance,
the
man
can
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
public
sampling.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
different
thing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
subjecting
him
to
jury
trial
after
he's
published
it
to
see
whether
he's
trying
to
vest
the
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
(voice
overlap)
jury
trial's
tomorrow
if
it
wanted
to
as
far
as
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
federal
constitution
is
concerned.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
responsibility
of
the
judge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
not
--
you're
not
undertaking
the
burden
that
you
very
wisely
injected
of
passing
on
whether
near
would
pass
this
obscenity
statute.
you're
merely
objecting
in
this
case,
who
are
--
the
arrangement
to
an
exercise
of
power,
whereby
a
concededly
obscene
book
is
prohibited
from
being
disseminated
after
it's
found
to
be
obscene.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you
afford
any
of
the
fine
place
between
coming
on
to
be
heard
and
eventually
determining
if
it
is
obscene
and
not
disseminating
it
in
the
mean
time.
that's
your
posture,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
obvious.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
redfield,
this
court
decided
some
years
ago
that
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
to
such
an
extent
that
it's
unconstitutional
to
allow
an
administrative
person
to
determine
citizenship.
that
in
deportation
cases
it
requires
the
court.
that's
reading
given
in
that
case
by
mr.
justice
brandeis
that
somehow
(inaudible)
is
a
matter
of
discipline,
is
a
matter
of
lot
of
things
there
are
protections
through
a
judicial
proceeding
that
are
not
afforded
by
the
administrative
proceedings.
and
now
you
should
say
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
problem
to
establishing
this
case.
this
proceeding
through
the
statute
was
carried
out
by
the
new
york
judges
for
censorship.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
job.
justice
felix
frankfurter
censorship
other
than
that
the
determination
after
judicial
proceeding,
satisfying
all
the
requirements
of
the
process
a
book
is
condemned
for
having
been
obscene.
but
that's
not
what
we
mean
by
censorship.
all
it
meant
in
the
near
case
is
prior
censorship.
if
you
can
or
that
you
can't
show
expressions
of
the
mind
in
advance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
the
advice
of
the
near
case.
that
they
said,
“hereafter,
you
can't
publish
your
papers.”
and
that
was
the
advice
in
--
what
was
that
case
we
had
here?
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
they
said
simply
because
you
were
--
unless
she
was
the
mayor
of
yesterday
you
can't
be
the
mayor
in
the
future.
that's
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
take
it
--
i
don't
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
so
i
ask
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
--
if
the
book
on
which
they
were
convicted
was
darwin's
argument
of
species
and
they
came
up
and
the
chief
justice
is
just
suggesting,
them
as
applied,
i
suppose
the
court
of
appeals
could
take
judicial
notice
of
what
the
argument
of
the
species
was
and
say,
that
isn't
what
the
statute,
but
the
statute
(a),
doesn't
mean
that,
if
it
did
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
not
contested
questions
of
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
there
is
--
if
there
is
also
a
constitutional
question,
thus
the
question
of
evidence
and
they
go
to
the
appellate
division
and
they
didn't
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
as
a
matter
of
course?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
there
is
a
constitution
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
others
do
not
displace
the
matter
of
right,
do
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
why
you're
arguing
this
because
as
i
understood
mr.
redfield,
he
concedes
--
he
assumes
that
this
is
obscene.
did
--
did
i
misunderstand
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
is
the
normal
cause
which
brings
you
up
when
the
issues
are
joined?
if
it
begins
with
--
what's
the
technical
term
of
the
papers
that
you
give
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
summons
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
between
the
summons
--
well,
this
is
a
summons
to
which
is
annexed
to
decide
to
have
this
--
this
enjoined,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
mean
in
this,
an
ordinary
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
injunction
case.
now,
between
the
summons
of
this
old
fashioned
bill
and
what
you
call
the
joining
the
issue,
what
is
the
normal
procedural
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
are
these
--
these
allegedly
noxious
books
at
once
--
is
their
dissemination
at
once
enjoined
automatically
on
the
party
of
the
complaint?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
not
ex
parte,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
it
was
not
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
of
the
statute,
mr.
quel?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
mean
the
substantive
law.
is
that
not
early?
is
that
date
from
1941?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
common
statute,
isn't
it?
in
--
in
the
various
states?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
the
english
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
english
statute's
a
parent
to
this
statute
is
--
is
1857,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
one
that
came
up
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
it
was
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
proceedings
before
magistrates
claiming
that
the
book
is
indecent
and
therefore
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
a
separate
section.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
construed
out.
