mr.
seymour
b.
quel
if
the
court
pleases.
in
order
that
your
honors
may
understand
how
narrow
is
the
issue
in
this
case
i
should
like
to
tell
you
a
little
bit
about
the
new
york
practice
which
is
pertinent
to
this
appeal.
this
case
was
tried
before
a
judge
without
a
jury
in
the
new
york
supreme
court,
which
is
our
court
of
original
jury
--
of
original
jurisdiction.
now,
after
a
judgment
has
entered
in
the
supreme
court,
there
are
two
methods
of
appeal
open
to
an
aggrieved
party
or
a
party
who
considers
themselves
aggrieved.
he
may,
if
he
wishes,
appeal
to
the
appellate
division
of
the
supreme
court.
and
thereafter,
he
may
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
provided
that
the
appeal
lies
and
it
always
does
when
it's
a
constitutional
question.
now,
if
you
take
that
kind
of
an
appeal,
you'll
bring
before
the
appellate
division
in
a
non-jury
case
every
question
which
was
before
the
judge
below.
they
can
review
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
they
can
reverse
if
the
findings
were
against
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
they
can
consider
any
question
which
the
judge
below
could
have
considered.
they
can
render
any
judgment
which
the
judge
below
should
have
rendered.
now,
the
defendants
in
this
case
did
not
follow
that
method.
they
went
by
another
route,
also
allowed
by
our
practice,
but
under
which
the
issues
are
much
more
limited.
they
took
a
direct
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court.
now,
you
can
only
do
that
under
the
new
york
practice,
where
the
only
question
involved
is
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute.
and
when
you
take
that
kind
of
an
appeal
you
waive
every
other
question.
you
waive
every
factual
question.
so
that
when
they
got
to
the
court
of
appeals,
for
example,
they
could
not
say
that
the
finding
of
obscenity
was
against
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
that
question
was
not
open
to
them.
if
they
wanted
to
do
that
they
should
have
gone
to
the
appellate
division
and
then
to
the
court
of
appeals.
so
that
they
were
left
in
the
court
of
appeals
by
the
method
of
the
--
of
procedure
which
they
deliberately
chose
with
one
question
and
question
only.
namely,
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
on
its
base.
there
can
be
no
quarrel
with
the
finding
of
obscenity
as
a
factual
finding
by
the
court
below.
they
didn't
bring
that
up
for
review.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
oh,
yes.
that
was
open
to
them
but
--
but
it
was
not
open
to
them,
for
example,
to
say
that
the
books
were
not
obscene
as
a
matter
fact
than
if
the
finding
of
obscenity
was
against
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
now,
in
addition
to
that,
by
that
method
which
they
chose
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
surely.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
surely.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
that
is,
the
statute
was
not
designed
to
cover
that
kind
of
a
book.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
yes.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
i
think
--
i
think
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
--
that
was
open
to
them.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
that
--
that's
correct.
and
i
--
and
i
think
it
might
--
i
think
it
was
open
to
them
to
argue
on
an
appeal
of
that
character.
i
think
you
can
always
argue
that
there
was
no
evidence
whatsoever
to
support
a
finding
of
fact.
but
so
long
as
there
is
some
evidence,
you
may
not
argue
that
the
finding
of
fact
was
against
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
it's
a
much
more
limited
and
narrow
type
of
appeal.
and
they
--
they
deliberately
chose
it.
they
could've
gone
by
the
other
route.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
as
a
matter
of
right.
you
can
appeal
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
that's
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
when
there
is
not
a
constitutional
question
you
need
permission.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
but
assuming
that
--
assuming
i
should
add
one
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
that's
correct.
you
--
i
won't
go
into
the
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
--
circumstances
under
which
you
can
appeal
when
there
are
others
in
constitutional
question.
but
there's
no
gainsaying
the
fact
that
where
there's
a
constitutional
question,
the
appeal
lies
as
of
right.
so
that,
for
example,
in
this
case
they
could
have
gone
to
the
appellate
division,
raised
any
question
they
wanted
to
in
the
appellate
division
and
then
if
there
were
a
unanimous
affirmance
against
them,
appeal
that
as
a
right
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
no,
i
--
i
think
that's
--
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
now,
more
than
that
when
they
got
to
the
court
of
appeals
or
under
the
limited
method
which
they
had
chosen,
they
could,
of
course,
have
raised
the
question
that
the
statute
was
so
vague
and
--
so
vague
as
to
be
unconstitutional.
but
they
never
raised
that
question.
now,
those
questions
which
are
raised
in
the
companion
cases,
which
are
being
argued
both
before
and
after
this
case,
were
never
raised
by
the
defendants
in
this
case.
and
for
that
reason
i
won't
devote
any
more
of
my
argument
to
that
question.
i'd
like
to
get
down
to
the
only
question
in
the
case
which
is
open
to
these
defendants
and
that
is
the
question
of
prior
restraint.
now,
their
position
is
in
essence
that
although
it
was
perfectly
all
right
to
enact
the
criminal
statute
against
the
distribution
of
obscene
literature,
there's
nothing
you
can
do
about
enjoining
it.
you
can
put
a
man
in
jail.
you
can
fine
him,
but
he
has
a
constitutional
right
according
to
their
argument,
to
go
on
and
carry
the
jail
sentences.
and
there's
nothing
that
can
be
done
about
it.
now,
the
prior
restraint
involved
in
our
statute,
if
it
can
be
fairly
called
any
kind
of
a
restraint
at
all,
is
about
as
narrow
a
restraint
as
you
could
possibly
get.
to
begin
with,
the
action
is
civil
it
is
not
criminal.
secondly,
the
statute
specifically
provides
that
after
the
joinder
of
issue,
the
defendants
are
entitled
to
a
trial
within
one
day
thereafter
and
are
entitled
to
a
decision
within
two
days
after
the
completion
of
the
trial.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
that
provision
was
waived
and
the
record
--
is
specifically
in
the
record
that
counsel
waived
that.
otherwise,
the
court
would
have
had
to
decide
this
matter
under
the
statute
within
a
--
within
two
days.
now,
the
only
other
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
surely.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
this
--
this
--
the
summons
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
--
and
the
complaint.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
in
an
ordinary
injunction
action.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
oh.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
well,
under
--
under
our
new
york
practice,
you
normally
have
20
days
in
which
to
answer
a
complaint
in
the
supreme
court.
but
you
don't
have
to
wait
for
20
days.
you
can
put
your
answer
in
the
next
day.
an
issue
was
joined
when
the
answer
comes
in.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
no,
not
automatically,
your
honor.
but
that
comes
in
under
--
not
the
provisions
of
section
22
(a)
of
the
code
of
civil
--
civil
procedure
which
is
here
involved,
but
under
our
civil
practice
act.
under
section
877
of
the
civil
practice
act.
in
any
equity
action
you
may
make
an
application
for
an
injunction
pendente
lite.
and
the
granting
of
that
injunction
and
whether
a
stay
shall
be
granted,
pending
the
hearing
of
the
motion
for
that
kind
of
an
injunction
are
matters
within
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court.
now
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
the
granting
of
the
order
to
show
cause.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
may
it
may
--
it
may
be
ex
parte
generally
is.
but
the
granting
of
the
injunction
pendente
lite
is
not.
now,
in
this
particular
case
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
and
if
a
judge
signs
it,
he
might
strike
it
out
and
sometimes
judges
will
not
sign
an
ex
parte
but
will
--
will
say
they'll
--
they'll
have
a
hearing.
that
frequently
happens.
but
nevertheless,
a
judge
may
sign
it
ex
parte.
and
in
this
particular
case,
the
order
to
show
cause
with
the
stay
in
it
was
presented
on
september
10th.
and
it
was
signed
retainable
on
september
14th,
and
then
apparently
the
motion
was
adjourned
for
three
days
until
september
17th.
and
on
september
17th,
the
motion
was
heard
and
the
defendants
consented
to
an
injunction
pendente
lite.
so,
that
that
question,
as
far
as
i
can
see
it,
is
out
of
the
case
at
least
as
far
as
these
particular
defendants
are
concerned.
now,
that
it
seems
to
me
points
up
the
very
narrow
issues
here.
now,
throughout
his
brief,
counsel
has
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
on
the
near
case.
and
he
pens
almost
all
of
his
argument
on
what
he
says
was
the
holding
in
the
near
case.
because
in
the
near
case
the
minnesota
statute,
which
was
under
attack,
permitted
the
enjoining
of
future
publications
of
the
particular
issues
involved.
and
this
court
held
that
that
was
unconstitutional.
now,
counsel
says
that's
true
but
also
involved
in
the
near
case
were
some
issues
of
the
particular
magazine
which
--
which
had
already
published.
and
the
judgment
enjoined
the
--
the
judgment
appeal
from
enjoining
the
sale
or
distribution
of
those
particular
issues.
and
therefore
says,
counsel
that's
just
like
our
case.
now,
actually,
of
course,
the
thrust
of
the
near
case
was
against
the
publication
of
the
future
issues
because
the
near
case
which
--
was
one
--
which
were
--
was
brought
against
the
publisher.
it's
true
that
incidentally
involved
in
near
were
some
copies
of
the
--
of
the
newspaper
which
had
already
been
published.
but
nobody
was
particularly
interested
in
those
if
it'd
be
just
as
though
you
were
trying
to
get
an
injunction
against
the
new
york
times
with
reference
to
future
publications.
now,
of
course,
nobody
would
be
very
much
interested
in
whether
issues
of
the
times
which
were
lying
around
at
all
and
had
already
been
printed
and
were
a
week
or
a
month
old
were
being
circulated.
it's
the
future
issues
of
the
magazine
involved
which
were
the
main
thing
in
the
near
case.
and
these
incidental
matters
were
simply
caught
up
in
the
sweep,
so
to
speak,
in
the
whole
thrust
of
the
court's
opinion,
as
i
read
it,
was
aimed
at
those
future
issues.
now,
i
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
well,
your
honor,
that's
a
--
not
an
easy
question
to
answer
for
this
reason.
we
began
this
proceeding
in
1954.
that
is
as
far
new
york
city
is
concerned.
of
course,
this
is
a
statewide
statute
and
i'm
not
familiar
with
how
it
may
operate
in
other
cities.
and
then
this
case
was
tried
and
--
and
the
appeal
was
taken
--
appeal
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
has
been
pending
in
this
court
for
quite
awhile.
and
--
and
in
the
mean
time,
as
i
recall
it,
there's
only
one
other
case
that
we
brought
in
new
york
city
under
this
particular
statute
and
everybody
agreed
to
await
further
proceedings
until
the
determination
of
this
court.
so
that
in
actually
practice,
as
far
as
i
know,
they've
only
been
these
two
cases
at
least
in
reason
is
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
well,
the
statute
has
been
on
the
books
since
1941.
but
in
1954,
it
was
amended
for
the
first
time
to
provide
that
the
corporation
counsel
was
one
of
the
persons
authorized
to
bring
the
action
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
the
penal
provisions
about
obscenity
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
--
have
been
there
for
a
long
time.
but
this
--
this
law
permitting
an
injunction
dates
from
1941
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
have
not
--
i
have
not
been
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
i
have
not
found
any
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
yes.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
in
--
in
covering
the
decision.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
but
as
far
as
i
know
--
well,
your
--
your
honor,
i
--
i'm
not
certain
now
whether
the
statute
involved
in
the
hickman
case
was
a
--
was
a
criminal
or
a
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
it
was
this?
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
i
might
say
while
we're
on
the
subject,
your
honor,
i
--
i
feel
constrained
to
call
your
honor's
attention
to
something
which
i
do
not
believe
affects
the
decision
in
this
case.
but
think
i
should
call
it
to
your
attention.
a
few
days
ago,
to
be
exact
on
--
on
march
26th,
this
statute
was
amended
in
several
respects.
the
only
one
which
is
material
to
our
present
discussion
is
that
it
added
a
provision
which
enjoins
among
other
things
the
publication
of
obscene
matter.
now,
what
that
means,
i
don't
know.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
it
is
not
a
separate
section.
it
is
an
amendment
of
the
statute
of
section
22
(a)
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure,
which
is
now
before
your
honors.
the
amendment
of
course
was
not
in
effect
when
this
case
was
brought
or
when
it
was
decided.
and
how
that
provision
would
be
construed
by
the
new
york
courts,
the
amended
--
to
reprovision
--
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
or
--
yes.
i
think
actually
what
they
mean
is
republished.
i
don't
think
that
they
meant
to
imply
that
you
can
enjoin
the
publication
of
--
as
yet
unpublished
obscene
matter.
if
they
did
mean
that,
i
can
see
that
the
statute
would
raise
grave
constitutional
questions.
but
that
is
not
involved
in
the
instant
case.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
i
--
i
think
it
would
be
if
--
if
it
were
actually
meant
to
enjoin
the
--
the
publication
of
matter
as
it
--
as
an
--
as
yet
unpublished.
and
i
might
say
in
that
connection,
your
honor,
i
forgot
to
mention
the
fact
that
in
this
very
case,
perhaps
in
an
excessive
order,
in
the
trial
court
we
tried
to
enjoin
not
only
the
14
issues
which
had
been
published,
but
two
other
issues
which
had
not
yet
been
published
because
we
said
it's
quite
evident
that
they're
going
to
be
just
like
all
the
others.
and
the
trial
court
refused
to
grant
that
injunction
and
we
did
not
take
any
appeal
from
that,
thereby,
recognizing
the
correctness
of
that
phase
of
the
judgment.
i
think
your
--
i
think
your
honors
in
view
of
the
narrowness
of
the
issues
i
can
--
i
can
rest
my
argument
there.
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
excuse
me
--
excuse
me
your
honor.
shall
i
leave
a
copy
of
this
amended
bill?
mr.
seymour
b.
quel
thank
you.
