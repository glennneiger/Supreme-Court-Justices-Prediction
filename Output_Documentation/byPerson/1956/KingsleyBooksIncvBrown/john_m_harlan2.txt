justice
john
m.
harlan
you
(inaudible)
so
i
understand
it.
you
--
you
concede,
i
take
it,
that
if
this
had
been
a
criminal
prosecution,
you
wouldn't
be
here
on
this.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
it
seems
the
narrow
issue
you're
putting
to
us
is
that
even
though
the
obscenity
statute
is
applied
to
a
criminal
case,
it
would
have
been
all
right
in
this
case.
the
injunctive
features
are
bad,
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
issue?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
take
it
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
in
your
position,
nothing
turns
on
the
degree
of
the
obscenity
that's
at
bar.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
it's
hard
--
what
the
government
calls
in
the
next
case
hardcore
obscenity,
why
your
point
would
be
still
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
was
(inaudible)
criminal
conviction,
under
new
york
statute
it
provided
that
one
duly
convicted
for
disseminating
obscene
material,
all
the
material
of
that
class
is
to
be
destroyed
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
he
also
had
a
sentence
in
there
that
indicated
they
might
be
some
difference
whether
it
is
an
obscenity
issue.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
stay
is
ex
parte
though.
the
order
to
show
cause
includes
to
stay
that's
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
the
practice
under
the
statute?
do
you
go
after
criminal,
answer
at
the
same
time
or
do
you
like
to
