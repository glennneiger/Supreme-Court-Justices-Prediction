brennan,

did
you
say
how
they
are
operating
license
was
an
issue?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
they
have
to
get
a
permission
to
operate
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
they're
certificated
as
a
partnership
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
the
record
show
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
to
have
no
doubt,
i'm
just
wondering
how
--
how
this
particular
partnership
got
the
right
to
operate.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
a
partnership?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
were
there
some
reason
why
the
government
preferred
not
to
precede
against
the
partners
rather
than
the
partnership?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
knowing
violation
that
you
would
prove
would
be
violated,
an
employee
i
think.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
agent
or
the
employee
i
get
as
not
being
a
partner.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
issue
of
knowingly
ever
been
raise
and
despite
from
seeing
against
the
corporation?
