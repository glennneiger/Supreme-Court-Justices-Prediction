mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
here
on
a
direct
appeal
from
a
judgment
entered
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
judge
newman
sitting,
dismissing
an
information,
charging
a
violation
of
18
u.s.c.
835,
a
provision
of
the
criminal
code
which
relates
generally
to
the
safe
transportation
of
explosives
by
common
carriers.
i
shall
come
back
to
the
specific
language
of
that
statute
in
a
few
moments.
the
sole
ground
of
the
dismissal
is
stated
in
a
two-sentence
memorandum
opinion
which
appears
at
record
23.
the
--
the
ground
there
stated
in
brief
is
that
a
partnership
cannot
be
held
criminally
liable.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
so.
i
think
it's
fair
to
state
that
the
decision
does
not
rest
on
a
construction
of
the
particular
statutes
involved
because
judge
newman
states,
your
honors
will
note,
that
regardless
of
the
wording
of
the
relevant
statutes
which
he
cites
and
despite
various
cases
which
he
says
were
cited
by
the
government
dealing
with
criminal
responsibility
attaching
to
unincorporated
associations.
and
i'm
quoting
directly
now.
"it
is
the
opinion
of
this
court
that
a
partnership
is
not
a
legal
entity
for
purposes
of
criminal
liability
herein."
well,
i
think
it
was
judge
newman's
view
that
the
very
nature
of
a
partnership
was
such
that
it
had
no
spaces
to
be
a
defendant.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
pardon
me?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
he
certainly
is
stating
that
he
is
deciding
for
purposes
of
this
case
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction,
but
i
think
his
language
that
regardless
of
the
wording
of
the
statutes,
there
is
no
jurisdiction.
implies
that
he
was
troubled
by
common
law
of
concepts
of
partnership,
which
of
course
are
to
the
effect
that
a
partnership
is
only
an
aggregated
individuals
and
has
no
status
as
an
entity.
on
the
question
of
their
power
of
congress
to
provide
that
a
partnership
shall
be
for
particular
regulatory
purposes
treated
as
a
person
or
as
an
entity,
we
feel
that
that
is
clearly
settled.
we
think
that
congress
were
purposes
of
regulatory
statutes
may
do
and
has
time
and
again
done
it
in
many
regulatory
statutes.
it
may
do
what
some
states
have
done
for
particular
purposes.
that
is
to
provide
that
an
entity,
concept
of
partnership
shall
be
the
prevailing
rule.
that's
most
federal
regulatory
statutes.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
contained
definition
sections
which
provide
that
for
purposes
of
the
particular
regulatory
scheme
of
the
word
“person”
shall
include
partnership,
corporation,
association
and
so
forth.
on
the
question
of
the
power
of
congress
to
do
that,
the
reason
that
we
feel
that
might
as
well
settled
is
that
this
court,
more
than
40
years
ago,
had
substantially
the
same
problem
before
it
in
the
case
of
united
states
against
adams
express.
in
that
case,
the
defendant,
the
adams
express
company
was
an
unincorporated
association.
it
was
tried
in
a
criminal
proceeding
for
a
misdemeanor,
also
one
relating
to
transportation,
namely,
that
it
had
departed
from
its
tariffs
on
file
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
adams'
defense
in
that
case
was
that
it
was
not
suable,
that
it
was
an
association,
not
--
not
a
corporation,
not
an
actual
person
and
not
reachable
sued
qua
company.
justice
holmes,
speaking
for
a
unanimous
court
said
that
it
was
inconceivable
to
the
court
that
the
interstate
commerce
act
was
intended
in
its
requirements
to
reach
only
common
carriers'
organized
incorporate
form
and
not
to
reach
carriers
organized
in
other
form.
we've
quoted
from
the
language
of
that
opinion
at
page
8
of
our
opening
brief
and
i'd
like
to
advert
to
a
single
sentence
of
it
in
which
justice
holmes
states,
"that
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
as
against
corporations
is
established,"
citing
the
court's
earlier
new
york
central
decision.
and
no
reason
is
suggested
why
congress
has
no
equal
power
to
charge
the
partnership
assets
with
a
liability
and
to
personify
the
company,
so
far
as
to
collect
a
fine
by
proceeding
against
it
by
the
company
name.
with
that
background
then,
let
me
turn
if
i
may
to
the
particular
statutes
which
are
the
basis
of
the
indictment
or
rather
the
information
in
this
case.
they
appear
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
it
was
an
association
as
distinguished
from
a
partnership.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
think
that
is
certainly
correct.
i
also
would
submit
to
the
court
that
the
principle
which
was
declared
in
that
opinion
that
it
is
within
the
power
of
congress
to
personify
a
company
is
equally
applicable
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
to
our
case.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
certainly
intend
to
turn
immediately
to
the
question
whether
assuming
congress
has
the
power.
if
we
do,
it
has
effectively
exercised
it
here.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
latter
question
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
presents,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
well,
in
--
i
would
like
to
turn
to
meet
that
question
to
the
particular
statute.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
well,
we
think
we
have
no
great
trouble
on
that
score
because
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
purely
regulatory
statute,
not
with
a
true
crime.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
passed
that
and
turn
to
the
question
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
because
i
--
i
have
concluded
with
that
right,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
particular
statute
in
order
to
go
forward
with
our
argument
that
congress
had
intended
to
exercise
that
power.
on
page
2
of
our
brief,
we
have
set
forth
18
u.s.c.
835
which
your
honors
will
note.
“it
provides
in
substance
that
the
icc
shall
formulate
regulations
for
the
safe
transportations
of
--
transportation
of
explosives
which
shall
be
binding
upon
all
common
carriers.
now,
that
language
which
shall
be
binding
upon
all
carriers
is
in
expressed
terms
what
justice
holmes
was
inferring
when
he
stated
that
congress
certainly
must
have
intended
the
interstate
commerce
act
to
be
binding
upon
all
types
of
carriers.
the
word,
"whoever,"
in
the
next
paragraph
where
congress
says,
“whoever
knowingly
violates
shall
be
punished
as
follows,”
is
not
defined
in
18
u.s.c.
835
itself.
so,
as
far
as
the
four
corners
of
the
statute
are
concerned,
we
place
primarily
reliance
upon
the
expressed
purpose
of
congress
to
make
the
regulations
binding
upon
all
common
carriers.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
this
is
a
common
carrier
by
motor,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
oh
yes,
they
are
certificated
carrier
and
many
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
the
certificate
does
not
require
a
carrier
to
operate
in
a
particular
form
of
business
organization.
the
application
would
disclose
that
the
applicant
was
a
partnership
or
a
corporation
of
course.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
no.
i
--
i'm
merely
stating
that
on
the
basis
of
the
general
procedures
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
i
think
the
court
can
take
notice
of
the
fact
that
there
are
partnership,
motor
carriers
and
corporate
motor
carriers.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
its
--
there's
no
question
that
it's
a
certificated
carrier
by
the
icc.
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
in
the
partnership,
its
application
would
be
and
its
grant
would
be
in
the
partnership
name.
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
the
government
initially
proceeded
against
the
individual
partners
and
the
motion
for
a
bill
of
particulars
was
made
at
the
opening
of
that
proceeding.
and
the
government
in
an
oral
bill
of
particulars
told
the
district
judge
that
it
would
not
be
able
to
prove
and
knowing
violation
by
the
individual
partners,
and
that
case
was
thereupon
dismissed.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
we
could
--
we
--
our
theory
would
be
that
on
remand,
we
can
prove
that
an
agent
or
an
employee
of
the
partnership
was
guilty
of
a
knowing
violation.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
that
of
course
is
a
quite
common
problem
that
the
government
can
establish
that
a
violation
has
occurred
in
a
large
organization.
perhaps,
it
can
also
establish
quite
clearly
that
a
particular
minor
employee
was
the
violator.
now,
as
a
matter
of
enforcement
policy,
the
government
frequently
deems
it
important
to
proceed
against
the
business
because
as
we
conceive
it
under
these
regulatory
statutes,
the
primary
responsibility
for
appointing
employees
with
requirements
seeing
that
they
observed
requirements,
supervising,
training,
policing
must
necessarily
rest
upon
the
heads
of
the
business.
and
as
we
also
think,
the
very
purpose
in
these
regulatory
statutes
of
defining
a
person
to
include
partnership,
association,
corporation
and
so
forth
is
to
make
the
business
as
such,
the
heads
of
the
business,
responsible
for
implementing
as
best
as
they
can,
the
many
regulatory
requirements
which
the
regulatory
statute
may
impose.
but
we
state
quite
frankly
to
this
court
as
we
did
below
that
we
were
preceding
against
the
partnership
because
we
didn't
think
that
we
could
prove
a
case
against
the
individual
partners,
but
thought
that
the
sanction
should
run
against
the
business
in
the
event
that
this
--
that
this
charged
violations
of
state
deregulation
were
approved
to
have
taken
place.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
that
question
certainly
alerts
in
--
in
the
case
and
our
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
and
our
argument
on
--
on
that
point
is
that
where
congress
has
regularly,
in
regulatory
statutes,
chose
them
to
define
person
to
include
partnership.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
i
hadn't
stated
that
provision
to
the
court.
i
am
just
coming
to
it.
1
u.s.c.
1,
a
general
definition
provision
of
the
united
states
code
states
that
in
determining
the
meaning
of
any
active
congress,
unless
the
contexts
indicate
otherwise,
the
words
"person"
and
"whoever"
include
corporations,
companies,
associations,
firms,
partnerships
and
so
forth.
now,
we
say
in
this
case
that
the
context
is
far
from
indicating
otherwise
has
the
same
indications
because
of
the
language
that
the
regulation
shall
be
binding
upon
all
common
carriers.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
it
--
it's
well
said
and
i
think
by
this
court's
decisions
that
under
many
criminal
statutes
that
the
knowledge
of
the
corporation
in
a
criminal
proceeding
under
a
regulatory
statute
may
be
established
by
proving
the
knowledge
of
its
agents,
officers
or
employees.
indeed,
but
in
otherwise,
we
could
not
proceed
against
the
corporations
that
it
cannot
act
same
through
its
agents.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
new
york
central
case
50
years
--
so
years
ago
was
such
a
case.
now,
i
think
it
is
also
relevant
in
dealing
with
the
question
whether
congress
meant
as
we
think
its
language
quite
clearly
imports
to
create
a
partnership
as
a
responsible
entity.
it's
relevant
to
look
at
what
the
interstate
commerce
act
generally
provides.
it
is
i
think
a
historical
accident
that
this
particular
provision
relating
to
the
transportation
of
explosives
appears
in
the
criminal
code
rather
than
in
the
interstate
commerce
act.
the
reason
for
it
is
that
congress,
as
early
as
1866,
first
became
concerned
about
the
transportation
of
explosives
and
attached
the
statute
in
that
year
relating
to
the
carriage
of
t.n.t.
by
vessels
which
also
carry
passengers
for
hire.
so,
congress
dealt
with
this
subject
long
before
there
was
an
interstate
commerce
act.
and
the
successor
statutes
relating
to
the
same
subject
of
transportation
by
--
of
explosives
by
common
carriers
have
all
followed
the
manner
and
the
mold
of
the
first
statute,
though
the
more
reason
statutes
delegate
the
matter
of
prescribing
the
standards
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
now,
of
course,
the
interstate
commerce
act
imposes
a
multitude
of
requirements
upon
carriers.
for
many
of
--
many
of
these
requirements
have
penalties
attached
in
the
event
of
violation.
in
addition,
the
commerce
act
provides
for
criminal
penalties
in
the
event
of
a
failure
to
obey
any
lawful
regulation
of
the
commission.
now,
all
of
those
offenses,
all
of
those
criminal
offenses
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
similarly
used
the
words
"knowingly"
and
"willfully."
moreover,
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
its
prohibitions
run
against
any
person
subject
to
the
act.
finally,
the
interstate
commerce
act
defines
a
person
and
it
defines
a
person
in
precisely
the
same
way
that
1
u.s.c.
1
does
or
at
least
substantially
so.
the
language
of
the
commerce
act,
the
motor
carrier
provision
is
as
follows.
person
includes
any
individual,
firm,
co-partnership,
company,
association
or
joint
stock
association.
now,
as
the
result
of
this,
the
government
has
regularly
proceeded
in
cases
involving
other
interstate
commerce
regulations
against
all
types
of
carriers
however
they
may
be
happening
and
however
they
may
be
organized.
we've
cited
in
a
reply
brief,
a
very
large
number
of
unreported
cases
involving
both
prosecutions
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
under
many
other
regulatory
statutes
in
which
the
government
has
successfully
proceeded
against
partnership
entity.
there
is
only
one
case
that
we
know
of
in
which
the
precise
question
raised
here
was
presented
and
resulted
in
the
writing
of
an
opinion
on
the
question.
that
was
an
opinion
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
a
case
called
evans
packing
company
against
united
states
which
--
from
which
we've
quoted
in
our
replied
brief.
that
too
supports
the
position
we
are
urging.
in
that
case,
the
government
had
charged
violations
of
the
agricultural
marketing
agreement
act
and
it
had
preceded
both
against
to
the
partnership
and
against
certain
name
of
partners.
the
district
court
imposed
fines
on
the
partnership
and
upon
the
individual
partners.
on
appeal,
it
was
urged
that
this
was
duplication.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
since
the
statute
in
question
made
the
partnership
a
separate
person
that
the
partnership
as
such
was
subject
to
a
fine
irrespective
of
whether
a
fine
was
imposed
upon
any
individual
partner
or
partners.
not
uncommonly,
the
government
does
proceed
against
a
partnership
and
an
individual
partner.
the
typical
case
is
the
situation
we
have
in
enforcing
the
food
and
drug
act.
if
the
violator
is
a
retail
drug
partnership,
invariably,
the
government
names
the
partnership.
it
is
also
the
government's
regular
practice
to
name
the
individual
performance
test
who
is
implicated
in
the
particular
act.
if
he
happens
to
be
a
partner
as
he's
not
in
frequently
the
case,
he
is
individually
named.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
so.
we're
not
attempting
in
this
case
to
do
so.
i
think
how
it
--
this
theory.
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
partnership
is
a
distinct
person
under
the
regulatory
statute.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
think
that
we
could
only
proceed
against
an
individual
partner
if
we
could
show
personal
knowledge
and
participation
on
the
part
of
that
partner.
i
think
that
under
the
regulatory
scheme,
we
may
proceed
against
the
entity,
defined
as
a
person
under
the
statute
as
we
view
it.
in
any
case
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
that
is
our
position.
we
--
we
--
i
want
to
make
quite
clear
that
we're
not
suggesting
that
we
could
proceed
against
the
partner
as
an
individual
without
showing
individual
knowledge
or
participation
on
the
part
of
such
partner.
our
position
here
is
that
it
was
in
this
court
in
the
borden
case
that
when
we
proceed
against
the
partner
as
an
individual,
they
must
prove
his
responsibility,
his
personal
knowledge
if
the
act
says
knowingly.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
right.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
where
we
proceed
against
the
entity,
of
course,
it's
clear
that
the
only
punishment
can
be
applied.
since
a
partnership
entity
no
more
than
a
corporation
or
any
other
artificial
person
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
so
far
as
we've
been
able
to
determine
that
question,
it's
not
yet
a
risk.[laughs]
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
of
course
the
--
the
regulatory
purpose
we
think
that
congress
has
in
mind
when
in
characteristically
defines
person
to
include
partnerships
for
purposes
of
a
particular
act
is
to
enable
the
government
to
impose
sanctions
upon
the
business
as
such.
we
think
the
philosophy
of
it
is
that
here
is
a
business
affected
with
a
particular
public
interest
and
regulation
and
the
impact
of
regulation
should
not
depend
upon
a
particular
form
in
which
the
company
has
organized.
our
concern
is
to
be
able
to
proceed
against
the
business
assets.
now,
whether
a
fine
upon
a
business
could
be
collected
against
the
individual
that
the
business
assets
were
not
sufficient
to
satisfy,
may
be
a
naughty
question
but
as
i
say,
it's
one
that
perhaps
fortunately
has
not
yet
arisen.
now,
we're
not
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
the
heart
of
this
statute,
18
u.s.c.
835,
a
statute
which
is
part
of
the
criminal
code
is
certainly
to
impose
penalties
and
congress
has
said
in
that
very
statute
and
this
is
the
context
now
that
it
shall
be
binding
upon
all
common
carriers.
now,
i
think
it's
also
fair
to
consider
as
context,
the
whole
scheme
of
regulation
of
carriers.
and
in
that
connection,
i've
tried
to
point
out
that
all
of
the
statutory
requirements,
all
of
the
regulations
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
all
of
those
are
for
knowing
unwillful
violation
in
terms
and
then
the
interstate
commerce
act
began.
congress
has
defined
a
person
to
include
partnerships
as
well
as
other
forms
of
business
organization.
now,
appellee
argues
that
the
notion
of
vicarious
criminal
liability
is
one
not
favored,
and
we
certainly
agree
where
the
true
crime
case
is
concerned.
but
the
purpose
of
regulatory
acts
like
these
is
not
to
single
out
that
individual
and
to
say,
“this
is
inherently
criminal
conduct
for
which
society
must
punish
and
correct.”
the
purpose
of
statutes
like
this
is
certainly
to
safeguard
the
public
and
we
think
--
in
order
to
do
that
effectively,
it
is
reasonable
for
congress
to
say
that
the
sanction
shall
be
imposed
upon
the
business
and
may
be
imposed
upon
the
business
as
well
as
against
particular
individual
violators,
employees
of
the
business.
professor
sayer
has
--
and
discussed
this
entire
problem
of
criminal
responsibility
for
acts
of
another
in
a
noted
treaty.
and
he
stated
at
his
conclusion,
a
sentence
which
is
the
heart
of
our
position
here.
“as
long
as
courts,”
he
says
“are
careful
not
to
commit
respondeat
superior
to
creep
into
the
true
crime
cases,
masters
and
principles
should
be
held
criminally
liable
for
the
petty
misdemeanors
of
their
servants
and
agents,
which
involved
no
moral
delinquency
or
severe
punishment
and
which
are
committed
in
the
course
of
the
master's
business.”
now,
of
course
we're
an
entity
as
the
defendant.
the
punishment
is
necessarily
limited
to
a
fine.
in
some,
the
consequence
of
te
view
we
urge
is
that
some
sanction
may
be
imposed
upon
those
who
are
in
charge
of
a
business
which
is
affected
with
the
public
interest,
those
who
are
in
the
best
position
to
prevent
violations
before
they
occur.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it's
our
position
that
the
only
defendant
is
the
partnership.
the
individual
partners
are
not
even
before
the
court.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
exactly.
