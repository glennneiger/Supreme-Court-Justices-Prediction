appellant,
versus
american
freightways
company,
a
partnership
composed
of
allan
j.
resler
and

mr.

chief

warren
mr.
(inaudible)
,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
supposing
the
statute
didn't
have
knowingly
in
it,
the
effects
of
18
--
835
didn't
have
knowingly
in
it,
would
you
say
your
case
was
different?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
same?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
it
your
position
in
this
case
that
the
employees
of
the
partnership
with
impunity
violate
this
law
as
often
as
they
want
without
any
liability
on
the
partnership
unless
you
can
bring
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
personal
knowledge
to
the
owners?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
might
be
absent
owners.
they
might
not
be
in
--
in
actual
contact
with
their
business
and
their
employees
might
be
violating
this
law
with
impunity
everyday.
now,
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
--
to
show
that
--
that
they
were
liable
before
you
could
enforce
this
regulatory
sanction
against
the
partnership
itself?
would
you
have
to
resort
to
employees
all
the
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
isn't
the
greater
purpose
of
the
government
to
sole
regulate
this
business
if
there
won't
be
any
accidents
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
of
that
time
and
that
this
--
this
violation
that
you're
talking
about
is
--
is
endangering
the
public
to
the
extent
where
--
where
there
might
have
to
be
such
a
project.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
government
contend
in
this
case
that
--
that
it
could
put
the
partners
in
jail?
i
understood
it
did
not
but
--
but
under
this
prosecution,
it
was
on
the
client
against
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
against
the
partnership.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
understood
mr.
spritzer
to
say
that
he
made
no
such
claim
but
the
only
--
the
only
claim
they
make
is
that
under
this
indictment,
the
--
the
partnership
itself
can
be
fined
for
--
for
the
violation
of
the
regulatory
act,
if
there's
any
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
we're
not
agreed
on
that.
i'd
like
to
ask
mr.
spritzer,
is
that
your
position,
mr.
spritzer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there's
no
question
upon
how
it's
imprisonment
at
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
would
be
true
with
the
corporation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
