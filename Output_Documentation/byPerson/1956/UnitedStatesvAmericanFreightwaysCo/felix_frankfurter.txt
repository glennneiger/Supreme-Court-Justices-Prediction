what
is
that?

(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
what
do
you
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
the
elements
--
before
the
elements
of
that
in
such
certain
case,
it's
certainly
not
present
to
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

kind
of
a
collective
value
and
the
express
company
for
reasoning
into
the
statute,
the
only
express
company
brought
in
this
kind
of
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
suppose
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
in
1957
that
congress
wouldn't
have
that
power?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
the
question
that
you
stated
is
the
one
we're
dealing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
stated
it
and
what
the
question
is
that
i
think
is
the
precise
question,
namely,
this
company
is
interfering
in
the
light
of
the
whole
background
of
partnership,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
to
say
and
that
there
may
not
be
a
question
under
the
due
process
clause
that
the
property
should
remain
in
the
(inaudible)
of
a
certain
crime
and
the
(inaudible)
knowledge
to
this
factually
in
fact,
proving
innocence
of
knowledge
of
--
of
their
knowledge.
well,
this
court
has
gone
very
far,
i
mean
in
regard
to
that
issue
in
the
--
in
the
opening
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
know
what
that
is.
your
job
(inaudible)
that
i
should
think
if
he
was
to
plan
to
argue,
but
congress
has
its
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
--
let
me
hear
(inaudible)
to
this
problem
when
a
statute
makes
it
a
penal
offense
knowingly,
not
doing
something
and
knowingly
do
something
whether
a
thought
of
it
having
the
permission
it
had
generally
speaking
in
the
law,
whether
knowingly
a
criminal
statute
defense
by
--
by
the
only
--
law
of
agency
applicable
to
civil
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
before
the
defense
on
how
you
construe
the
applicability
of
whoever
with
that
which
the
law
normally
regards
and
brought
the
individuals
to
unite
it
together
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
that's
forming
illegal
personality.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
general
suspendatory
provision
of
the
section
1?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
have
to
rely
on
the
generality
because
it
contends
to
with
the
reference
to
construe
the
interstate
commerce
act
under
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
hope
this
gets
done
in
ways
that
you
could
constitute
and
--
and
obtain
a
conviction
and
fine
a
$500,000
to
reinforce
against
the
partnership.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
it
gets
down?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
there's
not
enough
form
--
i
think
the
question
is
the
power
and
ability
in
that
--
your
case,
the
problem
in
this
case
raises
the
whole
position
of
the
partnership
in
our
law
which
cites
the
definition
in
u.s.c
1.
i
mean,
this
isn't
here
now
but
one
has
to
look
ahead
and
see
what's
the
implications
are
in
conflict.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
the
--
from
my
point
of
view,
we
are
not
in
the
position
to
--
on
a
real
position
as
a
partnership
in
the
whole
context
of
annual
american
law
not
treating
it
as
an
entity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
isn't
wiped
out
merely
by
the
definition
of
u.s.c.
1,
the
partnership,
the
person
includes
a
partnership
and
that
the
context
is
being
otherwise
--
indicated
otherwise.
i
should
read
into
context
a
lot
of
new
propositions
of
our
law
that
are
not
to
be
found
in
the
statute
and
which
--
in
which
the
statute
sought.
in
other
words,
it
isn't
although
i
may
have
no
difficulty
at
all
in
making
the
mere
regulatory
provision
of
an
act
covering
the
partnership.
the
objective
of
this
law
of
course
is
not
for
the
confusion
of
prohibition.
it
doesn't,
therefore,
follow
to
construe.
it
also
includes
from
the
citation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
to
say
that
inherent
--
as
far
as
inherent
to
makeshift
things
that
the
law
would
be
treated
--
a
partnership
the
way
that
the
continent
of
europe
(inaudible)
may
be
is
an
entity?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
you're
saying
is
that
the
general
acceptance
of
our
law,
partnerships
that
we
adhere
to
the
so
called
act
is
that
there
is
and
not
the
entity
theory
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
acceptance
of
all
legislation
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
that
i
should
describe
mr.
spritzer
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
following
you.
i'm
not
following
from
where
you're
going.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
following
from
where
you're
going.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
government
cites
a
lot
of
(inaudible)
cases.
they
present
different
terms
of
legislation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
this
case
mainly?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
following
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
the
government
said
in
effect
is
that
this
is
an
action
of
debt
for
a
$1000
brought
within.
indeed,
they
could
bring
these
facts
not
to
set
aside
as
i
understand
it
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
they
are
right
therefore.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
all
because,
the
penal
provisions
enforceable
merely
to
a
(inaudible)
and
if
that
is
to
say,
if
that
is
to
stay
then
it's
a
concluding
fact
that
all
common
law
soon
objects.
and
object
may
be
importance
on
the
(inaudible)
there
may
be
a
question
and
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
there
may
be
a
question
as
to
--
as
to
requirement
of
proof
but
the
government
said
that
these
other
partnerships
do
reduce
the
punishment
(inaudible)
action
of
liability.
it's
on
the
implication
of
impunity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
when
it
gets
done?
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
when
it
gets
done?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
actions
for
penalty
are
impossible
on
both
the
civil
and
the
criminal
side
counting
all
the
lines
in
the
history
of
england
and
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
this
is
correct.
i'm
not
saying
this
is
--
i'm
not
bringing
that
the
government's
position
to
accept
that.
i'm
trying
to
indicate
what
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
a
conviction
of
an
individual
and
the
government's
case
was
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
an
individual
can
be
constantly
convicted
on
the
suspension
of
respondeat
superior
on
short
answer,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
is
a
partnership.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
is
whether
the
congress
--
and
you
argued
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
is
debarred
by
the
constitution
by
confirmation,
i
don't
know
why,
due
process
from
holding
a
partnership,
the
partnership
asset
liable
for
violation,
criminally
liable
of
offenses,
punishment
that
can
be
needed
out
to
the
extent
that
can,
namely
the
problem
can
be
gone
on
the
basis
of
the
misconduct
of
the
agent.
are
you
arguing
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
what
are
you
arguing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
congress
cannot
undersay
that
if
a
business
is
--
kind
of
business
is
conducted
by
a
company
and
i
think
individual
or
by
incorporation,
by
two
or
more
people
doing
business
as
a
partnership.
if
any
of
their
agents
violates
the
way
of
interstate
commerce
act,
the
government
may
proceed
by
way
of
criminal
process
against
the
partnership
to
be
treated
as
an
entity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
they
can't
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that's
your
case,
then
why
do
you
talk
about
constitutionality?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
know
that's
one
thing.
that
is
a
prosecution
against
the
individual.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
might
have
landed
an
individual
in
jail.
now,
there
is
no
such
--
and
then
the
chief
justice
has
brought
out
by
questioning
at
the
end
of
that.
this
is
in
a
constitution
whereby
somebody
who's
going
to
jail,
the
difficult
question
is
whether
the
congress
of
the
united
states
by
virtue
of
section
1
of
the
u.s.
code
allows
prosecution
against
the
partnership
as
such.
this
is
a
common
place
state
law
(inaudible)
civil
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
unless
it
was
enacted
at
the
time
when
the
partnership
entity
theory
had
no
hold
at
all
on
lawmakers.
