mr.
attorney
general
if
the
court
pleases,
the
government
originally
filed
a
criminal
information
against
foreman
and
wrestler
doing
business
as
american
freightways
company,
a
new
york
partnership.
now
i'm
expressing
the
way
new
york
had
because
it
becomes
important
in
consideration
of
this
particular
case
with
a
violation
of
central
regulations
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
pertaining
to
the
transportation
of
a
corrosive
liquid
not
explosive.
and
i
emphasize
the
way
corrosive
liquid
because
it
was
caustic
pottage
and
that
comes
into
consideration
in
this
case.
it
was
a
single
shipment
on
march
3rd,
1954.
and
if
that
happened
as
the
government
contends
it
happened,
it
would
have
been
a
violation
under
the
criminal
code,
which
was
titled
18
u.s.c.,
section
835.
when
this
matter
came
to
trial
before
judge
bicks
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
he
permitted
the
government
to
read
into
the
record
in
the
nature
of
a
proper
approved,
a
bill
of
particulars.
in
this
bill
of
particulars,
the
government
outlined
its
case.
it
set
forth
the
names
of
its
witnesses,
what
each
one
would
prove,
what
each
one
would
testify
to.
and
at
the
end
of
that,
the
government
stated
that
they
would
not
attempt
to
prove
that
the
partners
had
knowledge
of
this
particular
shipment,
but
that
they
would
rely
upon
the
sum
knowledge
of
the
employees
and
imputes
that
knowledge
to
the
partners.
it
appeared
to
counsel
for
the
defendants
at
that
time
that
if
the
statement
of
the
government
was
accepted,
that
at
the
most
that
the
government
could
establish
was
some
negligence
on
the
part
of
an
employee
and
nothing
more.
and
so,
a
motion
was
made
to
dismiss
the
original
information
upon
various
grounds.
one,
that
the
information
was
pleaded
not
as
required
by
the
statute
which
was
knowing
violation
of
the
statute,
but
it
pleaded
a
public
welfare
or
malum
prohibitum
statute
which
was
not
before
the
court,
wherein
probable
intent
or
knowledge
was
not
part
of
the
crime.
secondly,
that
knowledge
could
not
be
imputed
to
the
individuals
and
before
any
discussion
could
be
held
upon
the
various
points,
that
the
court
picked
up
immediately,
this
point
of
imputing
knowledge
to
the
individuals
and
based
solely
upon
that
particular
point,
dismissed
the
information.
now,
in
dismissing
that
information,
the
court
passed
upon
--
discussed
two
cases,
the
first
one
was
boyce
motor
lines
against
the
united
states,
which
is
a
report
in
342
u.s.
in
which
this
court
had
before
it,
this
very
statute
under
consideration.
and
the
court
there
indicated
that
knowledge
on
the
part
of
a
defendant
is
an
essential
element
of
the
crime
under
section
835
because
the
statute
punishes
only
those
who
knowingly
violate
the
regulations.
and
then,
the
court
referred
to
a
second
decision
and
that
was
gordon
against
the
united
states,
which
was
on
all
force
with
the
case
before
it.
in
that
case
also,
there
was
involved
the
--
the
knowing
violation
of
a
regulation
under
the
war
production
act.
and
the
court,
the
district
court
charged
that
the
individual
--
that
the
partners
that
knowledge
of
the
agent
may
be
imputed
to
the
individual
partners.
in
that
statute,
your
honor,
your
honors,
there
was
even
a
definition
directly
in
the
statute
which
stated
that
pacing
shall
include
individuals,
corporations,
partners,
associations,
their
agents,
their
representative,
their
successors
and
so
forth.
and
despite
that
definition,
this
court
in
347
u.s.
ultimately
revised
the
district
court
and
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
held
that
it
cannot
impute
knowledge
to
these
individuals,
even
in
these
regulatory
statutes.
and
so,
the
government
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
and
while
that
appeal
was
pending
and
by
the
way,
that
appeal
has
never
been
withdrawn
and
it
is
still
pending,
they
handed
down
another
information.
this
time,
by
the
mere
juxtaposition
of
the
names,
they
created
a
new
information.
now,
instead
of
it
being
directed
again
to
two
individuals
doing
business
as
the
co-partnership,
they
now
have
the
partnership
consisting
of
the
two
individuals,
the
two
partners
that
comprise
it
so
that
the
partners
as
well
as
the
partnership
entity
if
they
--
as
they
refer
to
it
are
before
the
court.
and
at
this
point,
i'd
like
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
if
this
partnership,
if
--
if
there
was
conviction
in
this
case,
these
individuals
would
be
indelibly
stamped
with
the
conviction
as
though
they
were
named
separately
and
distinctly
from
those
of
the
partnership,
from
that
of
the
partnership
without
having
the
benefits
of
a
trial
or
the
right
to
come
before
the
court
and
testify
that
they
had
no
knowledge
of
the
act
of
these
--
of
an
agent.
but
when
this
second
information
was
handed
down,
we
then
made
a
motion
in
the
district
court
before
the
case
came
to
trial,
to
dismiss.
at
this
time,
upon
the
ground
that
the
information
was
insufficient
to
law
and
that
there
was
double
jeopardy,
that
there
was
an
appeal
pending
and
that
a
partnership
and
criminal
law
cannot
be
considered
as
a
separate
entity
as
distinct
from
the
partners
that
comprise
it.
now,
the
government
in
this
affidavit
submitted
in
our
position
to
this
particular
motion,
stated
in
a
--
stated
that
it
would
be
willing
to
submit
an
all
bill
of
particulars
exactly
the
same
as
the
bill
of
particulars
that
it
had
submitted
in
connection
with
the
information
directed
against
the
individual
partners.
they
raise
the
same
question
of
1
u.s.c.
1.
they
introduced
these
cases
involving
unincorporated
associations
and
they
relied
most
heavily
on
the
adams
express
company
case.
the
subject
was
brief
and
argued
before
judge
newman
and
judge
newman
held
--
dismissed
the
information
and
held
that
a
partnership
is
not
a
separate
entity
for
the
purposes
of
criminal
liability.
that
the
partners
themselves
are
the
one
that
may
be
punished
for
the
crimes
that
they
commit
or
that
--
or
committed
by
the
partnership
with
their
knowledge
or
consent
or
approval.
mr.
attorney
general
no,
sir.
it
will
be
the
same.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
sir.
i
will
come
to
that.
now,
what
does
the
--
the
government
then
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
from
that
decision
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
while
that
appeal
was
pending,
they
filed
a
third
notice
of
appeal
to
this
court
and
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction
because
under
section
3731,
there
is
a
question
of
an
interpretation
of
section
835
of
the
code.
now,
what
is
the
government
trying
to
establish
here?
they're
trying
to
have
this
court
phase
rule
in
connection
with
this
new
york
partnership
that
the
--
in
criminal
law,
a
partnership
is
a
separate
entity,
separate
--
a
distinct
entity
separate
and
apart
from
the
partners
that
comprise
it.
number
two,
they
say
to
your
honors,
we
--
we
say
under
this
case
impute
knowledge
to
the
partners
or
--
i
withdraw
that.
they
like
to
apply
the
principle
which
is
only
--
which
has
only
been
applied
up
to
now
to
corporations
of
vicarious
liabilities
to
that
other
partnership.
that's
where
they
stopped,
but
this
court
can't
stop
there
because
they
still
have
another
consideration.
the
statute
here
says,
“whoever
knowingly
shall
violate,”
so
that
this
court
must
go
further
and
fine
that
even
though
the
statute
says,
“whoever
knowingly
violates,”
that
you
can
still
impute
criminal
liability,
knowledge
and
whole
pacing
is
criminally
liable
even
though
they
do
not
have
knowledge
of
a
particular
violation.
that's
if
the
court
agrees
with
the
government
on
the
first
two
propositions.
and
in
that
respect,
i
have
very
great
doubts.
now,
under
the
--
i'd
like
to
take,
to
consider
first
the
first
proposition.
is
a
partnership
a
separate
entity
for
the
purposes
of
criminal
liability?
now,
the
government
in
its
briefs
have
mentioned
some
federal
rules,
civil
procedure
and
a
section
of
the
bankruptcy
act
and
cited
some
cases
on
unincorporated
associations
on
the
adams
express
company
case
to
support
their
position.
now,
if
the
court
pleases,
the
common
law
of
theory,
the
common
law
is
based
upon
the
aggregate
rather
than
the
entity
theory
of
the
nature
of
a
partnership.
the
uniform
partnership
law
of
the
state
of
new
york
is
based
upon
the
common
law
theory
and
the
--
this
statute
--
this
--
the
--
the
uniform
partnership
law
has
come
under
consideration
before
various
courts,
including
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york.
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
the
case
of
kaplan
against
kaplan
stated
that
a
partnership
is
not
like
a
corporation,
an
artificial
person
created
by
law
and
existing
independent
of
the
persons
who
created
and
control
it.
a
partnership
merely
has
a
name
by
which
individuals
conduct
a
joint
business.
in
law,
it
is
not
a
separate
entity
even
if
it
appears
to
have
some
attributes
of
a
separate
entity.
it
carries
on
business
as
co-owners.
and
in
the
most
recent
case,
williams
against
hartshorn
reported
in
296
new
york
at
page
49,
the
court
--
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
referring
to
a
partnership
also
said
that
a
partnership
is
not
to
be
regarded
as
a
separate
entity
distinct
from
the
persons
who
composed
it.
now,
even
the
federal
courts
have
considered
this
statute,
this
new
york
statute.
and
on
one
case,
helvering
against
smith,
judge
learned
hand
in
discussing
the
uniform
partnership
act
of
the
state
of
new
york
said
that
a
partnership
is
not
an
independent
juristic
entity.
well,
there
came
a
time
when
the
--
when
the
state
of
new
york,
the
legislature
said
that
a
partnership
may
be
sued
in
the
partnership
made.
and
the
rule
17
(b)
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure,
i
think
it
was
patterned
after
that
section.
and
thereto,
they
committed
a
partnership
to
be
sued
in
the
partnership
name.
and
the
question
is
to
whether
or
not
that
affected
the
partnership
theory
or
that
the
aggregate
partnership's
theory
and
change
it
into
a
separate
entity.
in
the
case
of
koons
against
kaiser,
91
f.supp.,
a
recent
case
decided
by
district
judge
kaufman.
and
he
said
in
that
case
that
this
section
222
(a)
of
the
new
york
civil
practice
act
was
merely
a
device
to
facilitate
partnership
litigation
and
it
was
never
intended
to
change
the
substantive
nature
of
a
partnership.
mr.
attorney
general
that
--
that's
just
--
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right.
mr.
attorney
general
no.
mr.
attorney
general
i
just
say
that
if
they
had
done
that,
it
would
have
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
partners
and
the
partners
would
never
have
been
able
to
escape
it
but
where
an
individual
act
takes
place
--
mr.
attorney
general
your
honor,
may
i
answer
this
way.
in
the
st.
johnsbury
case,
judge
magruder
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
considered
that
question.
he
said
that
if
congress
had
intended
to
hold
anyone
except
the
ones
who
actually
had
knowledge
of
this
act,
hold
them
guilty
except
those
who
actually
had
knowledge.
congress
could
have
enacted
a
public
welfare
statute
as
in
other
statutes
and
said
that
whoever
read
the
bind
so
far
as
agents
does
anything
which
--
so
this
effect
would
be
guilty
of
a
violation
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
there,
you
would
have
to
think
straight
before
the
court.
but
the
reason
--
mr.
attorney
general
yes.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right.
no
case
had
the
word
“knowingly”
in
it.
now,
i
say
this,
your
honor,
that
the
reason
that
put
the
word
“knowingly”
in
is
absent
into
the
government's
presentation
of
the
statute.
they
levied
in
the
statute.
the
real
reason
for
putting
the
word
“knowingly”
in
and
that
is
that
in
the
event
as
result
of
a
violation
of
this
regulation,
an
accident
occurs
and
someone
is
injured
then
the
person
shall
be
guilty
and
imprisoned
and
may
be
imprisoned
for
10
years
and
may
be
fined
$10,000.
in
other
words,
this
statute
is
meant
--
is
--
is
meant
to
punish
one
very
severely
in
the
event
an
accident
happened
and
the
person
is
injured
with
a
10-year
imprisonment
and
that
they
--
they
leave
out
of
their
code
of
the
statute.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
they
let
that
the
other
part,
your
honor.
they
--
they
put
their
asterisks
in
there
instead
of
putting
in
the
rest
of
the
statutes.
mr.
attorney
general
the
--
mr.
attorney
general
your
--
your
honor,
they
--
the
--
i
think
congress
meant
to
make
sure
that
the
persons
who
actually
commit
these
--
these
violations
shall
be
the
ones
to
be
punished
unless
it
is
authorized,
permitted
or
--
or
approved
in
some
form
by
--
by
the
employer,
your
honor.
the
congress
did
not
intend
to
--
to
punish
by
imprisonment
an
innocent
person
and
--
and
if
--
if
an
employee
makes
a
mistake,
clearly
as
happened
in
this
case,
the
--
the
partner
who
is
--
who
is
indictable
for
anything
he
does,
whose
asses
--
assets
are
subject
to
levy
should
not
be
punished
for
--
for
this
act
of
an
agent
when
it's
either
negligent
or
by
some
omission
which
is
no
fault
of
anybody.
mr.
attorney
general
no,
sir.
no
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
the
government
has
--
the
government
has
a
right
to
--
to
sentence
the
partners
as
i
read
the
statute.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
i
just
--
mr.
attorney
general
your
honor
--
if
your
honor
will
look
at
the
--
mr.
attorney
general
i
don't
think
so.
no,
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
i
don't
--
i
don't
see
--
mr.
attorney
general
i
don't
see
--
i
don't
see
how
they
could.
i
can't
--
i
can't
see
that
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
attorney
general
your
honor
--
your
honor
--
mr.
attorney
general
excuse
me?
mr.
attorney
general
well,
i
--
i
can
see
that
--
that
this
could
be
turned
into
a
civil
action,
your
honor.
mr.
attorney
general
your
honor,
as
i
--
as
i
have
argued
that
even
in
civil
law
and
i
haven't
--
mr.
attorney
general
your
honor,
even
under
the
civil
law
and
i've
only
so
far
touched
upon
the
civil
law
that
a
partnership
will
not
be
considered
as
a
separate
entity
according
to
the
decisions
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
decisions
in
this
court.
now,
your
honor,
coming
to
the
criminal
part
of
the
--
from
the
criminal
entity,
we
find
that
in
all
criminal
cases
and
we
have
found
no
decision,
no
court
decision
anywhere
where
a
partnership
is
such
or
as
a
separate
entity
was
convicted
of
a
violation
as
here
charged.
one
of
the
cases,
your
honor,
we
referred
to
is
the
shomberg
against
the
united
states,
which
is
a
california
case.
there,
the
statute
provided
for
punishment
against
an
individual
and
a
corporation
and
the
most
--
and
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
was
attacked
because
they
said,
“no
reference
was
made
to
a
partnership.”
and
the
court
there
held
that
the
statute
was
constitutional
and
that
because
a
partnership
is
a
separate
entity
--
as
a
distinct
--
as
a
partnership
is
not
a
--
a
legal
entity
set
from
the
part
from
the
partners
that
compose
it,
that
it
cannot
commit
a
crime.
and
therefore,
and
only
the
partners
themselves
may
be
punished
for
the
crimes
committed
in
behalf
of
the
partnership.
and
therefore,
they
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
that
statute
and
in
--
and
a
more
important
case
is
this
case
of
gordon
against
the
united
states
decided
by
this
court
which
we've
had
discussed.
and
in
that
case,
the
--
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
sir,
that's
true.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
sir.
i'm
coming
to
--
mr.
attorney
general
no,
sir.
i
am
not
and
i
--
mr.
attorney
general
and
i
--
and
i
say
your
honor
that
the
part
--
the
assets
can
be
reached
of
a
partnership
whether
it'd
be
in
the
hands
of
the
partnership
or
in
the
hands
of
the
--
the
individuals
under
the
bankruptcy
act
or
on
the
theory
of
marshalling
assets
because
the
assets
of
the
partnership
and
the
individuals
are
subject
to
the
--
to
levy
an
execution
for
the
debts
of
the
party.
mr.
attorney
general
they
can
--
mr.
attorney
general
they
can
say
it
but
they
didn't
say
it
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
attorney
general
but
they
didn't
--
yes.
they
didn't
say
it,
but
in
this
--
in
this
gordon
case,
your
honor,
the
attorney
general
(inaudible)
made
this
statement,
“a
partnership
is
not
a
separate
entity
but
is
the
partners
themselves.”
now,
here,
two
years
ago,
they
took
the
--
the
exact
opposite
position
in
--
mr.
attorney
general
yes.
mr.
attorney
general
your
honor,
section
1
u.s.
1
of
course
was
enacted
at
a
time
other
than
18
u.s.c.
835
and
congress
--
mr.
attorney
general
that
--
that's
right,
but
--
but
they
do
not
define
partnership
in
section
1
u.s.c.
1
nor
do
they
say
that
a
partnership
can
be
treated
as
a
separate
entity.
and
if
congress
in
18
--
in
835
had
intended
that,
one
have
so
said
it
because
when
they
use
the
word
“knowledge,”
“knowingly”
they
--
they
were
cognizant
of
the
fact
that
a
partnership
is
such
as
distinct
from
the
partner
that
comprise
it
cannot
knowingly
commit
a
crime
and
that
is
the
fundamental
law
and
the
substantive
law
of
the
land,
your
honor.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
they
--
they
enact
--
well,
the
corporation
is
entirely
different
as
our
cases
show
because
the
corporation
can
only
act
through
its
agents.
it
has
no
separate
thought,
willpower
or
--
or
anything
else.
it
can
only
act
through
--
through
the
end
--
through
agents
and
the
distinction
is
very
clearly
made
in
the
cases
which
we
cited
on
our
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
attorney
general
thank
you,
your
honor.
