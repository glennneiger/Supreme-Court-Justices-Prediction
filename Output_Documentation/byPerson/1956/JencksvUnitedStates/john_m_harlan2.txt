what
were
the
time
relationship
between
your
request
for
these
--
these
reports
at
the
trial
and
the
--
they
knew
a
man,
matusow
in
the
dimock
proceedings
in
new
york?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
new
trial.
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
you
submit
a
proposed
--
proposed
charge
or
request
a
charge
of
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
say
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
do
you
say
it's
an
indispensable
if
you
--
you
said
that
each
case
is
to
stand
on
its
own
bottom,
and
so
forth,
but
do
you
--
do
you
recognize
any
distinctions
to
the
rule
that
you've
got
to
show
prior
inconsistent
statement
in
order
to
lay
a
foundation,
or
in
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
say
that's
an
indispensable
prerequisite,
to
move
the
trial
judge
to
action
and
inspect
the
inspection
and
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
inspect
the
file?
justice
john
m.
harlan
any
one
thing
to
what
the
justice
has
said.
we
don't
know
what's
in
these
records
now,
i
take
it.
suppose
that
we
agreed
with
the
--
your
opponents
in
one
of
these
motions,
it
should
have
been
granted,
should
we
reverse
this
case
out
of
hand
or
should
we
remand
it
for
the
purpose
of
having
the
trial
court
find
out
what
is
in
the
records?
if
nothing
is
there,
of
course,
the
conviction
is
all
right,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
so,
can
they
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
one
question
that
perhaps
is
a
little
off
the
beat,
but
i'm
interested
in
it.
as
a
former
trial
lawyer
myself,
i
am
wondering
why,
in
all
of
these
cases,
the
government
seems
to
be
consistently
taking
the
position
that
it
won't
produce
these
documents
when
you
think
that
the
pure
tactics
and
strategy
of
the
case
would
result
in
instantaneous
presentation.
is
there
a
rule
in
the
department
that
betters
the
judgment
of
the
assistant
united
states
attorneys
in
giving
this
material
simply
because
it
becomes
an
fbi
files?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
i
suspected.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
i
suspected.
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
if
the
united
states
attorney
had
been
free
to
act,
why,
you
wouldn't
have
had
this
problem,
but
that's
not
this
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
the
documents
that
you
requested,
are
they
before
us
in
sealed
form
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
of
some
kind?
justice
john
m.
harlan
they're
not
part
of
this
record?
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
were
not
permitted
to
take
a
look
at
it.
