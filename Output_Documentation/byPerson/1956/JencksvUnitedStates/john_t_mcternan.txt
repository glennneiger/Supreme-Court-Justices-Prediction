mr.
john
t.
mcternan
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
that
court
affirmed
a
judgment
of
conviction
of
filing
a
false
non-communist
affidavit
under
section
9
(h)
of
the
amended
labor
act
and
an
order
denying
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
grounds
of
newly
discovered
evidence.
the
crimes
of
which
the
petitioner
here
was
convicted
was
a
false
denial
of
membership
in
the
communist
party
and
a
false
denial
of
affiliation
with
the
communist
party.
he
was
sentenced
to
five
years
on
each
count,
sentences
to
run
concurrently.
his
motion
for
a
new
trial
was
filed
sometime
after
the
close
of
the
proceedings
in
the
trial
court
and
the
newly
discovered
evidence
consisted
of
a
recantation
of
his
trial
testimony
by
the
crucial
government
witness,
one
harvey
matusow.
the
motion
was
denied
on
the
grounds
that
the
trial
court
disbelieved
the
recantation.
may
i
briefly
review
the
evidence
because
of
the
bearing
that
this
review
has
on
each
of
the
points
we
present.
the
affidavit
in
question
was
dated
april
28,
1950,
and
that
of
course
became
the
critical
date
as
of
which
the
government
had
to
prove
membership
and
affiliation
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner.
we
choose
to
divide
the
evidence
between
the
pre-affidavit
evidence
and
the
post-affidavit
evidence.
of
the
four
category,
there
were
approximately
seven
witnesses.
the
earliest
of
whom,
one
carey,
placed
the
petitioner
at
a
so-called
communist
meeting
in
april
1946,
some
four
years
prior
to
the
critical
date
and
the
last
one,
ford,
had
placed
him
in
a
communist
meeting
in
july
or
august
1949,
some
eight
or
nine
months
prior
to
the
critical
date.
two
witnesses,
ford
and
petersen,
connected
him
with
the
communist
party
a
little
more
closely,
ford
had
him
a
member
of
the
state
board
for
new
mexico
as
late
as
may
1949,
almost
11
months
before
the
critical
date.
petersen
placed
him
at
a
communist
party
convention
for
the
rocky
mountain
area
in
late
1947.
other
than
these
two,
ford
and
petersen,
the
testimony
consisted
of
--
of
placing
the
petitioner
at
a
so-called
communist
meeting
or
meetings
attended
only
by
known
communists
over
this
period
of
april
1946
to
july
or
august
1949.
the
post-affidavit
evidence
consisted
of
the
testimony
of
one
terrazas,
who
testified
that
in
addressing
union
meetings
in
1950,
1951
and
1952,
the
petitioner
urged
his
brethren
to
read
a
newspaper
called
the
daily
people's
world
which
other
witnesses
identified
as
a
communist
newspaper.
we
take
the
position
that
that
evidence
has
no
probative
force
on
either
the
issue
of
affiliation
or
membership.
we
point
out
that
this
court
held
similar
evidence
to
have
no
probative
force
on
the
issue
of
affiliation
in
bridges
against
wixon
and
we
submit
that
it
can
have
no
greater
effect
on
the
more
serious
and
formalized
relation
of
membership.
the
other
post-affidavit
evidence
consists
of
the
testimony
of
matusow.
he
related
four
incidents
occurring
in
late
july
and
early
august
1947,
in
which
he
had
conversations
with
jencks,
the
petitioner
here,
at
a
guest
ranch
in
northern
new
mexico.
the
most
lured
and
inflammatory
of
those
is
the
one
we
identify
in
our
brief,
in
the
summary
of
the
facts
as
the
do-day
incident
where,
according
to
matusow
at
the
trial,
he
and
jencks
exchanged
information
upon
what
they
and
fellow
communists
were
doing
in
the
struggle
for
peace
and
the
do-day
described
by
matusow
consisted
of
putting
up
posters
and
signs
around
the
town
advocating
the
alleged
communist
position.
and
in
addition
in
this
incident,
matusow,
and
this
i
what
i
referred
to
as
the
luring
part
of
it,
said
that
jencks
had
told
him
that
he
and
the
other
communists
and
the
union
were
plotting
with
the
mexican
miners
union
for
arrangements
to
conduct
a
strike
which
would
cut
off
copper
production
for
korea.
now,
if
the
court
please,
there
are
claims
by
the
government
that
there
is
other
post-affidavit
evidence
in
this
record
including,
as
the
government
has
presented
it,
evidence
which
the
trial
judge
struck
out.
now,
without
going
into
the
details
of
that,
we
simply
contest
the
government's
position
and
our
position
is
fully
set
out
in
our
reply
brief
at
pages
three
to
five.
matusow,
we
submit,
is
the
crucial
witness.
the
only
post-affidavit
witness
having
any
probative
force
and
because
he
is
the
only
post-affidavit
witness
having
probative
force,
he
is
the
only
witness
having
probative
force
because
it
is
our
position
that
under
this
court's
opinion
in
douds,
the
pre-affidavit
evidence
standing
alone
would
be
insufficient,
and
i
refer
to
that
passage
in
the
douds
opinion
to
the
effect
that
a
person
who
was
once
a
member
of
the
party
or
affiliated
with
the
party
could
sign
the
affidavit
upon
terminating
his
connection.
and
we
point
out
again
that
the
last
of
the
pre-affidavit
evidence
came
only
to
within
nine
months
of
the
critical
date.
now,
i
turn
first
to
our
point
one,
the
issues
surrounding
our
motion
to
the
trial
court
for
production
of
statements
of
two
witnesses
which
were
made
to
the
f.b.i.
in
the
course
of
the
witnesses'
career
as
professional
informers
for
that
agency.
first,
our
motion
made
at
the
trial
itself.
we
confine
this
discussion,
if
the
court
please,
to
the
matusow
statements.
in
doing
so,
we
do
not
abandon
our
position
concerning
ford,
but
we
concentrate
on
matusow
because
his
testimony
was
crucial
at
the
trial
because
of
the
recantation.
and
because
this
witness
himself
poses
grave
problems
to
the
administration
of
justice
and
i
refer
to
the
fact
that
he
was
one
of
the
three
witnesses
as
to
whom
there
stood
the
unchallenged
charge
of
perjury
upon
which
this
court
acted
in
communist
party
against
the
subversive
activities
control
board,
because
this
witness
was
held
by
that
board
not
only
in
the
proceedings
which
followed
this
court's
order
but
in
proceedings
which
preceded
this
court's
order
as
being
a
wholly
unreliable
witness
not
entitled
to
the
reliance
of
any
trier
of
fact
because
this
witness
was
the
one
involved
in
united
states
against
flynn,
whom
judge
dimock
found
to
have
perjured
himself
in
that
case
and
because
his
recent
conviction
of
perjury
in
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
all
indicate,
if
the
court
please,
that
we
have
here
a
problem
which
our
courts
face
in
seeing
to
it
that
the
administration
of
justice
is
cleansed
of
the
products
of
such
people.
and
while
this
problem
differed
in
details,
we
submit
that
it
is
the
same
in
essence,
as
that
which
this
court
disposed
of
last
week
in
mesarosh.
now,
as
to
the
documents
at
issue,
we
point
out
that
these
are
matusow's
own
statements.
they
were
his
reports
given
to
his
superiors
in
the
f.b.i.
at
the
time
he
was
serving
as
an
informant.
that
they
are
contemporaneous
or
nearly
so
with
the
transactions
which
they
record,
that
they
were
prepared
under
instructions
to
be
complete
and
not
selective
in
what
he
reported
and
that
they
are
therefore
probably
the
most
reliable
evidence
that
exists
today
and
which
existed
at
the
time
of
the
trial
and
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
on
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
as
to
what
did
occur
back
in
1950
when
matusow
said
he
had
the
conversations
with
jencks
at
that
guest
ranch
in
new
mexico.
finally,
we
point
out
that
we're
dealing
here
with
only
a
few
documents
covering
a
period
of
about
three
weeks,
matusow
testified
that
he
reported
a
minimum
of
once
a
week
so
we
can
assume
we
have
about
here
three,
perhaps
four
or
five
documents.
as
to
the
setting
of
the
motion
addressed
to
the
trial
court,
i
say
again
matusow
was
the
crucial
witness.
he
was
admittedly
on
cross-examination,
a
professional
informer
witness
whose
rewards
by
way
of
important
position
with
state
committees
dealing
with
so-called
un-american
problems,
with
this
agency
in
new
york
known
as
counterattack
which
became
the
volunteer
sensors
of
the
stage
and
screen
in
america.
his
campaign
participation
on
behalf
of
senator
mccarthy
and
others
in
the
1952
campaign,
all
of
these
are
in
the
record.
further
as
to
the
setting,
matusow
testified
only
to
uncorroborated
oral
admissions
generally
regarded
as
the
weakest
of
evidence.
in
two
prior
performances
concerning
jencks,
at
least
before
legislative
committees,
this
witness
had
failed
to
mention
three
of
the
four
incidents
which
he
covered
in
his
trial
testimony.
the
cross-examination
showed
a
long
course
of
repeated
lying
for
petty
gain.
against
this
setting,
we
moved
to
the
trial
court
to
require
the
government
to
produce
these
statements
to
the
court,
not
to
us,
but
to
the
court.
the
court
to
examine
the
documents,
ascertain
whether
they
had
relevance
for
impeachment
purposes
and
if
so
to
turn
the
documents
over
to
us.
when
this
motion
was
refused
without
a
statement
of
reasons,
we
asked
that
the
reports
be
required
to
be
produced
to
the
court
and
by
its
seal
for
purpose
of
the
record
on
appeal
and
this
also
was
refused.
we
turn
now
to
the
questions
as
to
why
this
motion
should
have
been
granted.
it
would
seem
to
us
at
the
outset,
if
the
court
please,
that
there
is
something
draconian
and
certainly
antediluvian
in
the
sense
that
it
precedes
our
civilized
concepts
of
justice,
that
the
prosecutor
should
be
able
to
hold
in
his
file
documents
which
bear
upon
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
a
man
charged
with
crime
and
not
be
required
to
cast
that
light
on
the
issues
of
guilt
or
innocence
before
the
trier
of
the
fact.
the
most
important
reason
why
this
consideration
of
policy,
we
submit,
should
apply
here
is
that
this
man
matusow
was
the
crucial
witness,
he
was
as
--
a
highly
suspect
witness
and
i
submit
that
there
was
enough
before
the
court
in
his
cross-examination
at
the
trial
to
put
up
the
warning
signals
that
are
debacle,
like
what
happened
in
mesarosh,
was
in
the
making.
further,
we
point
out
that
these
--
these
reports
that
we
asked
for,
the
statements
of
his
were
contemporaneous
and
likely
to
be
complete.
and
we
submit
that
the
request
went
to
documents
best
--
best
equipped
to
point
out
the
truth.
they
were
asked
for
in
a
situation
where
the
doing
of
justice
demanded
the
most
searching
of
cross-examination
and
we
think
that
the
government
had
an
obligation
to
turn
these
documents
over,
they
were
no
longer
confidential
because
the
bringing
of
the
prosecution
itself
had
waived
whatever
governmental
privileges
attached
to
those
portions
of
the
documents
which
were
relevant
to
this
proceeding
and
that
is
all
that
we
ask
that
the
court
turn
over
to
us.
the
government,
we
point
out,
under
this
court's
observations
in
the
berger
case,
had
a
higher
obligation
than
that
of
convicting
matusow
and
had
the
obligation
of
seeing
that
justice
was
done
and
therefore
not
to
withhold
from
the
court
any
information
which
bore
upon
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
man
charged.
to
adopt
the
language
of
the
second
circuit,
once
the
prosecution
has
begun,
it
must
be
conducted
in
the
open
and
it
lies
not
with
the
government
to
suppress
documents
which
record
the
very
transactions
upon
which
the
government
sought
to
predicate
guilt
and
which
documents
may
tend,
and
i
quote
the
--
the
court,
“may
tend
to
exculpate.”
under
the
rule
of
the
second
circuit,
if
the
court
please,
unless
that
obligation
is
discharged,
the
prosecution
will
fail.
to
adopt
perhaps
a
less
formal
formulation
of
the
--
of
this
approach
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
fisher
case,
one
would
except
the
government
to
be
glad
to
turn
over
the
documents.
if
they
did
not
serve
to
impeach
the
witness,
the
government
stood
to
lose
nothing.
if
they
serve
to
impeach
the
witness,
the
documents
serve
the
government's
highest
obligation
of
seeing
that
justice
is
done.
now,
the
court
below
and
the
government
here
take
the
position
that
the
government
need
not
turn
over
the
documents
even
to
the
trial
court
for
its
examination
unless
the
defendant
first
shows
a
contradiction
between
the
testimony
of
the
witness
and
the
statement
at
issue.
this
position
is
based
squarely
upon
this
court's
holding
in
the
gordon
case.
the
motion
there,
we
point
out,
was
a
motion
for
direct
access
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
to
the
witnesses'
statement
and
we
agree
that
under
those
circumstances
the
showing
of
contradiction
is
necessary
in
order
to
protect
the
government's
interest
because
such
a
showing
of
contradiction
is
necessary
to
establish
relevance
and
the
defense
in
those
circumstances
asking
for
direct
access
is
not
entitled
to
the
documents
unless
they're
relevant.
but
we
say,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
gordon
case
is
inapplicable
here
because
here
our
motion
was
for
production
to
the
trial
court
for
the
trial
court's
examination
to
determine
relevance
and
this
fully
protected
the
government's
interest.
second,
let
me
point
out
that
the
record
reflects
an
effort
on
our
part
to
show
a
contradiction.
we
asked
matusow
whether
he
had
put
in
his
reports
any
statement
concerning
this
do-day
conversation,
which
i
described
earlier.
his
reply
was
that
he
could
not
recall
the
contents
of
any
of
his
reports,
these
three
years
after
the
reports
had
been
submitted.
now,
the
government's
position
here
would
make
the
issue
turn
on
the
answer
of
the
witness.
the
claim
of
the
witness
of
no
recollections
or
of
no
contradiction
could
be
honest
but
mistaken
or
could
be
dishonest,
deliberately
false.
the
greater
the
passage
of
time,
the
greater
the
chance
of
an
honest
mistake.
the
more
a
suspect
the
witness,
as
we
have
the
situation
here,
the
more
likely
a
dishonest
and
deliberately
false
statement.
in
short,
the
greater
the
need
for
searching
cross-examination,
the
less
likely
that
the
instruments
for
that
cross-examination
would
be
made
available.
we
are
informed,
i
was
not
present
last
week
when
the
lightfoot
case
was
argued,
but
we
are
informed
that
the
solicitor
general
took
the
position
here
that
even
if
the
witness
denies
that
there
is
a
contradiction
between
his
statement
and
his
trial
testimony,
the
court
can
look
at
the
statements
to
determine
whether
there's
a
contradiction.
if
that
is
the
solicitor
general's
position,
we
submit,
then
the
government
is
insisting
only
upon
an
empty
formality
that
the
question
be
asked
as
some
kind
of
ritual
before
the
documents
be
turned
--
be
turned
over.
i
would
like
to
close
this
point
by
suggesting
to
the
court
that
here
we
cannot
ignore,
as
we
deal
with
the
trial
record,
what
we
must
necessarily
know
as
a
result
of
the
record
on
the
hearing
for
the
motion
for
a
new
trial.
at
that
hearing,
matusow
asserted
that
the
documents
did
contradict
his
trial
testimony
and
this
testimony
at
the
hearing
would
--
showed
a
comprehensive
and
thorough
contradiction
between
the
reports
and
the
trial
testimony.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
the
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
he
said
that
his
reports
would
show
that
he
had
no
conversation
with
jencks
concerning
the
communist
party
or
communist
party
membership
or
communist
party
activity.
that
he
never
identified
jencks
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party
in
any
of
his
report.
now,
i
think
that
on
that
statement,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
chances
are
that
the
reports
are
silent
on
the
four
transactions
that
the
witness
testified
to
at
the
trial
and
therefore
the
reports
are
valuable
as
impeachment
because
under
the
circumstances
under
which
they
were
prepared,
if
the
transactions
occurred,
they
would
have
been
reported
and
therefore
the
failure
to
mention
them
is
equivalent
to
asserting
that
they
didn't
have
it.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
thank
you.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
my
attention
was
called
to
the
fact
that
i
misspoke
in
indicating
the
time
as
of
which
these
four
incidents
in
the
matusow
trial
testimony
occurred.
they
were
in
july
and
august
of
1950.
i
would
like
to
turn
now
to
the
situation
of
the
hearing
on
the
motion
for
a
new
trial.
there,
it's
to
be
emphasized,
we
asked
for
a
similar
production
to
the
court
of
the
same
report
as
those
into
which
our
motion
at
the
trial
has
been
directed.
in
these
proceeding,
matusow
was
petitioner's
witness.
on
his
direct
examination,
he
gave
a
complete
and
detailed
recantation
of
his
trial
testimony.
without
going
into
the
details
here,
let
me
simply
refer
to
appendix
1
of
our
opening
brief
where,
in
parallel
columns,
the
trial
testimony
and
the
hearing
testimony
are
compared.
on
cross-examination,
the
government
attacked
the
recantation
as
a
recent
fabrication
corruptly
induced,
and
the
details
of
this
many-sided
and
lengthy
attack
are
set
out
in
our
opening
brief,
in
rough
outline
at
pages
18
to
20
and
in
some
detail
in
appendix
2.
now,
against
this,
matusow,
on
redirect
examination,
said
that
his
contemporaneous
reports,
these
documents
that
are
in
issue
here,
to
the
fbi
would
show,
as
i
said
just
before
lunch,
that
he
had
no
conversation
with
jencks
concerning
the
communist
party
or
the
communist
party
activities
or
party
membership
and
that
he,
in
his
reports,
never
identified
jencks
as
a
communist.
now,
in
this
posture,
i
submit,
the
fbi
statements
of
matusow
had
obvious
relevance
for
purposes
of
rehabilitation
because
these
were
records
made
as
of
a
time
before
the
motive
to
fabricate
had
been
shown
to
exist.
these
were
the
contemporaneous
reports
and
there's
nothing
in
the
evidence
dealing
with
fabrication
of
a
recantation
which
goes
back
earlier
than
1954,
1955
which,
of
course,
is
three,
four,
or
five
years
after
the
events
occurred
and
the
reports
were
written.
now,
the
government's
position
here,
as
we
apprehend
it,
is
that
matusow's
trial
testimony
did
not
say
that
jencks
was
a
communist
and
that
matusow's
testimony
at
the
hearing
concerning
his
reports
did
not
show
a
contradiction
between
the
reports
and
the
trial
testimony.
now,
i
submit
that
this
is
simply
not
true.
it
is
not
supported
by
the
record.
i
do
not
want
to
take
the
time
for
a
detailed
analysis
of
the
evidence
here.
we
make
it
at
pages
15
to
17
of
our
reply
brief.
in
short,
let
me
say
that
if
matusow
had
been
put
on
at
the
trial
to
testify
to
those
four
incidents,
it
was
to
show
admissions
on
the
part
of
petitioner
that
he
is
--
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
as
of
that
time.
now,
that
could
have
been
the
only
purpose
of
his
testimony.
therefore,
when
he
said
at
the
hearing
that
his
reports
did
not
identify
jencks
as
a
communist,
that
he
--
that
they
did
not
reflect
conversations
concerning
the
party
or
party
activity
or
membership,
there
was
a
direct
and
complete
contradiction
with
his
trial
testimony.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
yes,
your
honor.
there
was
a
--
a
separate
request
for
those
reports
couched
in
precisely
the
same
terms
as
at
the
trial.
we
asked
that
the
reports
be
produced
to
the
trial
judge,
the
trial
judge
to
examine
them
for
the
purposes
of
determining
their
relevance
and
to
release
to
us
only
those
portions
which
were
relevant,
this
time
for
purposes
of
rehabilitation
rather
than
for
purposes
of
impeachment
because
the
posture
was
different.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
the
government
didn't
have
time
to
object,
your
honor.the
trial
court
said
that
there
was
no
need
to
produce
the
secret
files
of
the
fbi.
that
was
the
ruling.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i
agree
that
it's
a
problem,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
a
different
problem
from
the
one
we
have
here
and
i
think
--
i
think
what
you're
raising
is
how
do
we
decide
this
matter
without
trespassing
on
--
on
that
field.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
yes.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i
think
that
it
would
be
correct
to
say
that
the
grand
jury
minutes
are
enclosed
with
a
greater
degree
of
privacy
than
the
statements
of
a
witness
made
to
a
prosecutor
in
the
course
of
an
investigation.
i
would
suggest,
although
i
haven't
actually
sought
this
problem
out,
that
at
least
some
indication
that
there
had
been
a
shift
in
the
witnesses'
recollection
of
the
fact
should
come
out
at
the
trial.
i
recall
that
this
issue
was
decided
by
the
second
circuit
in
the
remington
case,
i
think
it's
191
f.2d,
where,
as
i
recall
that
case,
the
witness
had
testified
at
the
trial
that
she
had
changed
her
mind
about
certain
things
at
some
stage
in
the
--
in
the
long
process
between
the
commission
of
the
alleged
crime
and
the
time
she
testified.
and,
it
was
on
that
basis
that
the
court
held
that
the
grand
jury
minutes
there
should
be
turned
over
to
the
defense.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
yes,
and
i
think
that's
another
ground
upon
which
grand
jury
minutes
should
be
treated
differently
from
the
things
we
have
here
because,
here,
we're
dealing
with
statements
related
specifically
to
the
events
testified
to
or
the
facts
testified
to
at
the
trial
where
the
grand
jury
minutes
may
roam
over
many
areas
and
touch
upon
many
different
people.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
i
said
that
with
reference
to
the
grand
jury
minutes,
yes.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
we
had,
here,
no
showing
of
specific
--
excuse
me
--
contradiction
between
these
reports,
these
contemporaneous
reports
which
are
not
--
which
were
not
grand
jury
minutes,
if
you
understand,
and
the
witnesses'
trial
testimony.
what
we
had
here
was
a
witness
who
was
so
crucial
to
the
case
and
so
suspect
by
the
nature
of
his
avocation
and
as
to
whom
other
discrepancies
had
been
shown
that
we
show
the
court
the
need
for
searching
cross-examination
of
this
witness.
further,
we
had
an
attempt
to
show
the
contradiction
which
has
been
frustrated
by
the
witnesses'
claim
that
he
couldn't
remember.
now,
your
honor,
what
we
ask
for
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i
think
that
should
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
yes.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i
understand.
i
think
that
the
fact
that
the
witness
is
an
informer
is
an
extremely
important
element
in
indicating
the
need
for
bringing
these
reports
out.
i
think
that
the
importance
of
the
witness'
testimony
to
the
prosecution
is
an
extremely
important
element.
here,
the
man
matusow
testified
to
the
crucial
issues
of
the
case,
membership
and
affiliation.
now,
if
he'd
been
some
witness
who
testified
to
some
essentially
collateral
matter,
our
approach
here
might
be
quite
different.
we
didn't
ask
for
reports
on
some
of
these
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
a
nonprofessional
witness
might
very
well
testify
to
a
crucial
matter,
yes,
your
honor.
let
may
say
that
we
did
not
ask
that
these
reports
be
turned
over
directly
to
us.
we
sought
to
safeguard
for
the
government
a
judicial
examination.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
they
are
almost
simultaneous,
your
honor.
matusow
filed
a
recantation
in
our
case
and
he
filed
a
recantation
in
the
flynn
case
before
judge
dimock
within,
i
think,
a
week
or
10
days
of
each
other.
i'm
not
sure
of
the
exact
time.
now,
the
proceedings
before
judge
dimock
occurred
prior
to
the
proceedings
before
judge
thomason
in
our
case
on
the
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
--
on
the
motion
for
new
trial.
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
agreed
to
set
our
hearing
at
a
time
to
suit
the
government's
need
for
investigation,
and
their
investigation
of
matusow
took
place
essentially
through
judge
dimock's
proceedings
and
the
grand
jury
proceedings
that
were
going
along
simultaneously.
i
--
i
concede,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
our
case,
here,
for
the
production
of
the
record
at
the
trial
does
not
turn
upon
a
showing
of
contradiction.
it
turns
upon
these
other
policy
considerations,
to
which
i
think
we
must
add
the
fact
that
our
effort
to
show
a
contradiction
was
frustrated.
and,
given
all
of
the
considerations
which
indicate
the
policy
that
i
have
outlined
here,
i
think
that
we
should
not
be
refused
the
--
the
motion
that
we
asked
for
simply
because
this
kind
of
witness
especially
says,
“i
have
no
recollection.”
now,
getting
back
to
the
thread
of
my
argument
dealing
with
the
proceeding
at
the
hearing
on
the
motion
for
a
new
trial,
i
submit
that
in
addition
to
the
relevance
of
these
documents
for
purposes
of
rehabilitation,
they
should
have
been
looked
at
by
the
trial
judge
for
another
and
important
policy
reason.
i
have
already
indicated
the
reliability
of
these
documents
as
contemporaneous
reports.
on
the
motion
for
a
new
trial,
the
trial
judge
had
a
special
responsibility
to
exhaust
all
efforts
to
find
the
truth.
he
has
to
protect
the
judgment
of
his
court,
if
truth
lies
behind
that
judgment,
and
he
has
the
responsibility
to
do
justice
if
truce
attacks
that
judgment.
given
this
responsibility
of
the
judge,
plus,
such
facts
which
i
select
out
of
many
in
the
record
of
the
fact
of
recantation,
the
claim
of
corrupt
inducement,
many
prior
declarations
by
this
witness
which
supported
his
recantation
and
many
would
support
at
his
trial
testimony,
and
they're
all
laid
out
in
some
detail
in
appendix
2
of
our
brief,
plus,
the
crucial
nature
of
matusow's
testimony.
we
submit
that,
in
this
kind
of
situation,
it
was
essential
to
apply
that
this
tedious
regard
principle
which
this
court
annunciated
in
communist
party
against
sacb.
it
was,
we
submit,
the
responsibility
of
the
court
on
its
motion,
having
--
indeed
having
knowledge
that
these
reports
existed,
to
inspect
them
in
order
to
make
certain
that
the
doing
of
justice
be
made
manifest.
now,
we
have
involved
in
this
point,
if
the
court
please,
one
different
kind
of
document,
and
i
emphasize
this
because
there
were
some
confusion
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
as
between
this
document
and
others
that
we
have
already
dealt
with.
this
man,
matusow,
went
to
an
fbi
agent
named
crandall
at
a
time
intermediate
his
grand
jury
testimony
and
his
trial
testimony
and
said
to
him,
says
matusow
at
the
hearing,
“i
told
him
that
i
did
not
want
to
testify
in
the
jencks
trial
that
was
coming
up.
i
did
not
think
my
testimony
was
honest.”
now,
we
asked
for
the
production
of
that
document
in
order
to
assist
in
the
rehabilitation
of
matusow.
i
should
say
here
that
matusow
testified
at
the
hearing
that
when
he
spoke
to
this
agent
crandall,
he
told
crandall
what
to
write
down
and
he
said
crandall
wrote
it
down
and
showed
it
to
him
for
matusow's
approval,
so
that
i
think
that
--
and
matusow
did
approve
it,
so
that
i
think
that
this
document
is
on
the
level
of
a
statement
by
matusow
comparable
to
the
ones
that
we've
been
dealing
with
so
far.
now,
in
addition
to
the
relevancy
of
this
as
rehabilitation,
because,
again,
this
came
before
the
facts
which
the
government
relies
on
to
show
motive
for
fabrication,
there
is
an
additional
ground
to
why
this
document
should
have
been
produced.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
i
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i
--
i
endeavored
to
--
to
quote
the
language,
your
honor.
i
think
it
refers
to
the
grand
jury
testimony,
but
there
is
a
difference
--
a
factual
difference
between
the
government
and
us
on
that.
and,
as
near
--
as
nearly
as
i
can
put
it
without
looking
at
the
record,
he
said,
“i
told
crandall
i
did
not
want
to
testify
in
the
trial
--
jencks
trial
coming
up.
i
did
not
think
my
testimony
was
honest,
that
--
or
that
is
the
substance
of
what
i
said.”
now,
this
statement,
as
it's
described
in
matusow's
testimony,
we
submit,
put
the
government
on
notice
that
this
man,
matusow,
was
a
person
of
questionable
reliability
and
this
underlines,
if
the
court
please,
the
importance
of
those
contemporaneous
reports.
if
the
contemporaneous
reports
contradicted
the
grand
jury
testimony,
even
by
omission
in
the
--
in
the
matter
that
i
described
to
the
chief
justice
before
lunch,
the
government,
i
submit,
should
have
been
alerted
by
that
fact
of
the
possibility
of
perjury
in
the
upcoming
trial.
now,
we
make
no
charge,
if
the
court
please,
that
government
counsel
is
guilty
of
any
kind
of
misconduct.
but,
we
do
say,
and
we
say
it
with
great
emphasis
that
there
was
enough
shown
to
require
the
trial
judge
to
obtain
all
of
the
facts
and
all
of
the
evidence
indicating
what
matusow
knew
the
truth
to
be
and
the
government's
awareness
of
his
knowledge.
now
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
yes,
your
honor,
there
was.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
that
the
fbi
records
are
confidential.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
the
government
produced
the
witness
crandall
who
testified
and
denied
that
the
conversation
had
taken
place
as
matusow
testified
at
the
hearing.
crandall
had
an
entirely
different
version
of
the
conversation.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
that
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
--
matusow
said
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
--
it
was
written.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
i
can't
--
i
can
agree
to
everything
your
honor
has
said
except
government
refusal.
the
government
had
no
opportunity
at
that
hearing
to
refuse
anything.
the
--
the
trial
court
ruled
before
the
government
expressed
itself.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
if
i
may
slightly
change
your
honor's
statement,
the
government
--
the
court
permitted
the
government
witness,
crandall,
to
testify
to
his
version
of
the
conversation
and
refused
our
motion
that
the
memorandum
of
the
conference
to
be
produced
to
the
court
for
its
inspection
to
see
whether
it
had
relevance
at
the
hearing.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
it
was
--
according
to
matusow's
testimony,
it
was
a
memorandum
made
by
the
agent
crandall,
virtually
at
matusow's
dictation,
and
submitted
to
matusow
for
approval.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
he
said
that
he
wrote
it.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
excuse
me,
sir,
that
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
mr.
crandall,
as
i
recall,
was
not
cross-examined
at
all
at
the
hearing.
the
--
the
request
for
the
production
of
the
document
to
the
court
in
the
manner
i've
indicated
was
not
abandoned
or
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
mr.
crandall's
testimony
begins
at
page
752
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
--
of
the
record.
that's
the
large
volume.
excuse
me,
the
small
volume
2
of
the
--
of
the
hearing
record.
if
you'll
notice,
i
was
mistaken
about
his
cross-examination.
he
was
cross-examined
beginning
at
page
756,
and
he
says
at
757,
“i
indicated
in
my
memorandum
to
the
officers
that
he
had
told
me
that
he
was
having
marital
difficulties
and
felt
that
a
reconciliation
could
be
affected
and
that,
for
that
reason,
he
would
not
like
to
testify
further
in
the
jencks
case.”
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
that's
correct,
your
honor.
with
the
observation
that
i've
tried
to
make
clear
throughout
this,
we
did
not
ask
that
these
documents
be
produced
directly
to
us
but
to
the
trial
court
in
the
manner
already
indicated.
now,
if
i
may,
i
will
pass
on
to
our
second
point
dealing
with
the
instruction
on
membership.
the
text
of
this
instruction
can
be
found
at
page
16
of
our
opening
brief,
the
one
with
the
green
cover,
or
page
416
of
the
record.
our
contention
is,
first,
that
this
instruction
gave
the
jury
no
legal
guidance
whatsoever
on
the
question
of
membership.
as
we
see
the
problem,
the
word
“member”
is
not
a
self-defining
term
and
there
is
no
common
understanding
as
to
its
meaning.
the
usual
approach
of
the
courts
has
been
to
define
member
in
each
case
in
terms
of
the
formal
requirements
of
the
organization
itself,
both
as
to
becoming
a
member
and
as
to
remaining
a
member.
and,
this
court's
construction
of
the
statute
appears
to
be
in
accord
with
this.
in
douds,
it
was
said
that
in
a
case
precisely
like
the
one
we
have
here,
i
don't
say
that
the
douds
case
was
precisely
like
it
but,
in
describing
a
set
of
facts
precisely
like
the
situation
we
have
here,
that
the
opinion
says
that
the
act
of
joining
is
crucial.
we
read
this
to
mean
not
that
the
government
must
prove
the
specific
act
of
joining
in
each
case,
say,
as
was
done
in
galvan
against
press,
but
where
that
proof
is
lacking,
the
government
must
prove
a
course
of
conduct
that
manifest
the
existence
of
the
relationship.
and,
in
such
a
case,
we
submit
to
have
probative
force,
this
course
of
conduct
should
be
related
to
the
organization's
formal
requirements
or
it
would
have
little
or
no
meaning.
now,
the
charge
here
ignored
both
the
specific
act
of
joining
and
a
course
of
conduct
manifesting
that
the
act
of
joining
had
been
consummated
and
the
relationship
maintained.
the
instruction
did
not
advise
the
jury
that
any
particular
conduct
need
be
found.
the
charge
was
permissive.
it
specified
two
kinds
of
conduct,
attendance
at
meetings
or
holding
office,
either
one
or
neither
of
which
the
jury
might
rely
upon
in
producing
and
in
reaching
its
verdict.
ignoring
both
of
these,
the
jury
was
permitted
to
consider
what
the
court
described
as
conduct
consistent
only
with
membership
or
“all
other
evidence,
direct
or
circumstantial,
which
bears
or
may
bear
upon
the
question
of
whether
the
defendant
was
a
member
on
april
28,
1950.”
and,
this,
without
any
word
of
guidance
as
to
what
this
kind
of
generality
means,
consist
--
conduct
consistent
only
with
member
or
all
other
evidence
which
may
bear.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
yes,
we
did,
your
honor.
it
appears
at
page
462,
i
believe,
of
the
trial
record
that
the
law
requires.
they
are
at
page
462
of
the
long
instruction.
this
instruction,
we
submit,
the
court's
instruction
now,
not
the
one
we
submitted,
left
it
to
the
jury's
personal
notions
as
to
legal
principle
and
arbitrary
selection
of
evidence
to
conclude
whether
or
not,
from
the
evidence,
the
petitioner
was
shown
to
have
been
a
member
on
the
critical
date.
if
i
may
return
briefly
to
the
question
of
attendance
of
communist
party
meeting,
the
evidence
related
attendance
at
“closed
the
communist
meetings”
or
meetings
attended
by
persons
--
only
by
persons
“known
to
be
members
of
the
party”.
now,
we
submit
that
this
evidence
is
insufficient
in
law
to
prove
membership
because
it
is
wholly
circularly.
it
assumes
the
fact
sought
to
be
proved.
as
the
ninth
circuit
pointed
out
in
bridges
against
the
united
states,
if
the
defendant
was
not
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
then
all
that
his
evidence
proves
is
that
he
attended
a
meeting
at
which
everybody
else
was
a
member.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
yes.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
yes,
sir.
our
position,
among
others,
is
that
they
could
have,
found
--
on
that
charge,
could
have
found
him
a
member
based
on
that
curry
testimony
in
april
1946.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
that's
our
position,
your
honor,
yes.
we
point
out
that
this
language
also,
your
honor,
permits
the
jury
to
find
the
evidence
or
find
the
conclusion
of
membership
upon
pre-affidavit
evidence
alone
and,
indeed,
invites
that
because
the
only
evidence
dealing
attendance
in
communist
party
meetings
and
the
only
evidence
dealing
with
holding
office
in
the
communist
party
is
pre-affidavit
evidence,
the
evidence
that
comes
to
an
end
in
late
july
or
early
august
1949.
and,
we
submit
that,
under
douds,
this
is
clearly
impermissible.
now,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
wonder
if
i
might
reserve
my
remaining
10
minutes
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
--
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
thank
you
mr.
lindsay.
i
have
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
--
space
and
time
problems,
your
honor.
california
is
rather
distant
from
washington.
may
i
have
a
reasonable
time
considering
those
problems
to
respond
to
mr.
lindsay's
memorandum?
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
two
days?
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
thank
you,
sir.
if
mr.
lindsay
would
get
it
to
me,
i'll
arrange
for
him
to
get
it
to
me
in
new
york
before
i
return
to
california
and
i'll
file
a
response
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
--
before
i
leave.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
if
the
court
please,
i
agree,
as
i
tried
to
indicate
in
my
opening
argument
that
the
court
is
confronted
with
a
serious
problem
of
policy
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
by
the
contentions
we
raise
here.
i
think,
however,
that
the
court
should
not
deal
itself
and
find
not
to
decide
the
problem,
as
we
urge
that
it
would
be
decided,
by
what
i
would
characterize,
good
naturedly,
as
a
bugaboo
which
the
government
--
i
think
the
government
is
presented
here.
in
the
first
place,
this
is
not
a
novel
problem
in
the
administration
of
justice,
although
it
is
the
first
time
this
problem
has
reached
this
court.
the
role
adopted
in
the
second
circuit,
as
i
understand
it,
is
very
clear.
judge
learned
hand,
a
few
days
after
writing
the
opinion
in
the
krulewitch
case,
described
in
the
cohen
case
what
the
krulewitch
case
stood
for.
and,
he
said,
there,
we
held
that
when
statements
are
taken
by
the
prosecution
which
appear
upon
inspection
by
the
judge
to
contradict
the
testimony
of
the
witness
when
he
is
called
at
the
trial,
the
accused
should
be
allowed
to
inspect
them
since
he
cannot,
otherwise,
impeach
the
witness.
now,
i
think
it
is
important
that
we
emphasize
two
things
from
that
statement,
that
the
contradiction
appears
as
the
result
of
the
inspection
by
the
judge
and
the
practical
--
the
problem
that,
otherwise,
the
contradiction
will
not
appear
because
it
lies
not
within
the
power
of
the
defense
to
show
the
contradiction
except
through
the
mouth
of
the
witness
under
cross-examination.
i
would
say
that
the
case
was
so
rare
that
it
hardly
deserves
consideration
that,
under
other
circumstances,
the
contradiction
between
the
report
or
statement
and
the
witness'
trial
testimony
could
appear
except
on
the
cross-examination
of
the
witness
himself.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
leave
that
out.
i
haven't
gotten
to
it
yet,
but
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
what
counsel
has
said
in
part
is
a
bugaboo
because
he's
making
a
kind
of
problem
beyond
its
proper
proportion.
we
are
not
asking
here
for
the
distillations
of
what
the
witness
reported
in
the
memorandum
that
go
back
in
phalanx
after
phalanx
in
the
department
of
justice
files.
we're
asking
for
the
witness'
statement.
we're
not
asking
for
all
of
the
witness'
statements.
we're
asking
for
narrowly
described
statements
dealing
with
specific
transactions
concerning
which
he
has
testified.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
in
this
case.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
either
way,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i'm
sure
your
honor
does
and
i
--
and
i
--
while
i
don't
want
to
get
us
involved
in
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i've
known
judges
who
are
in
both
sides
of
the
fence
in
all
parts
of
the
country,
your
honor,
and
all
i
suggest
is
that
weakness,
if
it
exists,
can
hurt
the
defendant
here
as
well
as
it
can
hurt
the
prosecution
because
i
have
found
in
my
criminal
experience
that
weak
judges
often
tend
to
decide
in
favor
of
the
prosecution
not
only
because
they
are
afraid
of
reversals.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i
stand
by
that
statement,
your
honor,
but
i
want
it
--
i
want
the
seriousness
of
the
problem
presented
in
its
proper
dimensions
and
contour.
now,
where
a
problem,
and
this
goes
to
the
momentum
argument,
where
the
problem
is
presented
to
the
trial
court
in
the
kind
of
terms
that
counsel
described
asking
for
voluminous
records
of
undetermined
description,
it's
easily
disposed
of,
as
a
trial
judge
did
in
the
mesarosh
case,
and
it's
reported
and
cited
in
our
opinion,
where
he
said
that
“unless
you
can
describe
the
documents
narrowly,
i
will
not
consider
it”
and
he
refused
the
request
because
they
weren't
described
narrowly.
if
the
problem
is
that
the
reports
that
counsel
said
involved
other
people,
and
this
is
akin
to
the
grand
jury
transcript
problem
that
you
raised,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
inspection
by
the
trial
judge
protects
the
government's
interest
there
because
this
is
not
a
situation
in
which
direct
access
to
the
defense
is
asked
for,
only
access
by
the
defense
to
the
portions
which
the
trial
judge
says
is
relevant.
now,
let
me
discuss
how
this
works
out
practically
because
i've
had
this
motion
granted.judge
dimock
granted
this
motion
in
the
trial
of
flynn.
and,
there,
he
examined
the
report
and
he
covered
up
the
parts
which
he
thought
were
not
relevant
and
released
only
the
parts
which
were
relevant,
and
he
protected
the
government's
interest
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
--
in
its
entirety.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
yes.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i
think
it
presents
that
difficult
problem.
the
second
circuit
has
held
it,
by
directing
counsel
to
ask
that
the
document
be
sealed
for
purposes
of
review
on
appeal.
now,
it
doesn't
meet
your
entire
problem.
what
it
gives,
the
defendant
an
additional
opportunity,
at
least,
to
get
another
judicial
reaction
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
--
to
the
document.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
that
--
that's
correct
and
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
no,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
not
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
our
request,
to
that
end,
was
denied.
we
asked
judge
thomason
to
seal
them
for
purposes
of
the
appellant
record
and
refused
to
do
so.
the
documents
were
never
produced
to
anybody,
and
so
far
as
i
know,
they
weren't
even
in
the
courtroom.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
that's
right.
i
recognize
that
our
motion
places
a
responsibility
on
the
trial
judge
to
make
a
determination
as
to
relevance.
i
simply
ask
that,
in
the
interest
of
the
sanctity
of
the
administration
of
justice,
it's
reliance
upon
truth
that
the
trial
judge
is
so
not
burdened
rather
than
that
the
power
to
determine
it
be
left
with
a
suspect
witness
who
can
simply
avoid
the
whole
problem
by
either
saying
“i
don't
remember
that
there
is
a
contradiction”
or
“there
is
no
contradiction.”
may
i
emphasize
again
that
the
discussion
of
the
crandall
report
may
have
created
the
impression
here
that
the
motion
which
was
directed
to
the
trial
judge
at
the
hearing
for
the
contemporaneous
reports
was,
in
effect,
the
same
motions
as
had
been
made
and
was
directed
to
the
same
report
as
the
motion
made
at
the
trial.
in
other
words,
the
contemporaneous
reports
were
at
issue
by
virtue
of
our
motion
at
the
trial
for
purposes
of
cross-examining
matusow
and
again
at
the
hearing
for
purposes
of
rehabilitating
matusow.
now,
i
say
that,
in
those
terms,
sure,
counsel's
statement
that
the
judge
had
discretion
to
say
“i've
heard
all
about
this
case,
i
care
to
hear.
i
don't
need
anything
more”
falls
at
its
own
weight
because,
with
showing
of
contradictory
statements
between
trial
testimony
and
hearing
testimony,
where
the
long
showing
which
the
government
had
made
as
to
repeated
statements
by
matusow.
first,
that
“my
trial
testimony,
all
of
my
testimony,
similar
to
my
trial
testimony
was
true.”
but,
on
the
other
hand,
saying
it's
dishonest.
this
gave
the
trial
judge
no
discretion,
i
submit,
to
say
“i
have
heard
all”
until
he
had
in
fact
heard
all,
and
he
had
not
heard
all
until
he
saw
those
contemporaneous
reports.
may
i
also
refer
again
to
the
matusow
testimony,
i
submit
that
there
is
no
corroboration
of
matusow,
and
matusow
corroborates
no
one.
he
talked
about
events
in
1950.
the
other
testimony
dealt
with
the
events
in
1949
going
back
to
1946.
this
organization
anma
that
was
referred
to
is
not
the
mexican
miners'
union.
this
is
an
--
a
separate
organization
in
the
united
states
composed
of
people
in
the
united
states.
there
is
no
corroboration
between
matusow
and
any
other
witness.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i
don't
find
--
i
don't
read
what
he
said
as
finding
corroboration.
what
he
said,
in
effect,
was
that
he
disbelieved
the
recantation
and
that
he
thought
there
was
enough,
over
and
above
matusow,
to
support
the
verdict.
this
is
what
the
court
below
said.
i
think
that
portions
of
the
two
holdings
are
erroneous
because
the
pre-affidavit
evidence,
i
submit,
as
a
matter
of
law,
is
not
sufficient
to
support
the
verdict.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
no,
your
honor.
that
--
i
agree
with
your
statement.
we
don't
quite
reach
of
that
problem
here
as
we
presented
the
questions
but,
obviously,
if
we
follow
the
rule
of
the
griffin
case
on
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
we
--
it
would
be
dogmatic
to
say
that
the
jury's
knowledge
of
matusow's
admitted
perjury
could
not
have
affected
the
verdict.
it
would
seem
to
me
that,
had
this
come
out
before
the
jury,
we,
at
this
stage
of
the
case,
and
no
appellate
court
could
say
that
the
result
might
not
have
been
different
or
might
not
have
been
affected.
could
i
just
address
myself
to
the
question
that
both
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
raised
as
to,
in
the
event
the
court
decides
that
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
--
one
or
more
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
--
of
the
motions
was
improperly
decided,
what
should
this
court
do.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
yes,
it
would.
i
think
we
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
right.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
thank
you,
sir.
i
would
say,
at
the
outset,
that
if
this
court
should
decide
that
one
or
more
of
our
motions
on
these
documents
had
been
improperly
refused,
it
would
justify
a
reversal
and
a
remand.
i
would
say,
however,
that
it
is
important
also
in
the
administration
of
justice,
so
far
as
this
statute
is
concerned,
that
the
court
passed
on
the
instruction
points,
particularly
in
membership
and
affiliation.
this
case
prevents
precise
--
almost
precisely
the
same
instruction
that
was
involved
in
the
hofmann
case,
on
which
certiorari
was
denied.
i'm
informed
that
almost
the
same
point
comes
up
in
connection
with
the
travis
case
which
is
now
pending
in
the
tenth
circuit.
and,
if
there
is
to
be
a
new
trial
and
the
jury
is
to
take
a
look
at
such
facts
as
the
government
now
can
decide
on
this,
the
same
question
of
instructions
will
--
will
confront
us
in
the
trial
court,
and
i
submit
that
it
would
be
a
duplication
of
effort
if
this
case
were
to
be
sent
back
to
be
submitted
to
a
jury
on
these
instructions
because
i
submit
that
they
are
fatally
improper
and
vague.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
thank
you,
sir.
well,
there
are
other
matters
that
mr.
lindsay
has
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
--
write
on
that
i
probably
would
want
to
reply
to.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
thank
you.
