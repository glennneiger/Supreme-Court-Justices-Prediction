was
there
any

you

you

that

not
said
this

and
written
it
down
and
then
refused

over

justice

well,
did
the
court
decline
to
permit
the
introduction
of
a
paper
and,
yet,
permit
the
government
to
introduce
a
witness
to
testify
overly
as
to

well,
according
to
the

mr.

statement,
who
wrote
this

he

it.
justice

can
you
give
us
the
page,
of
--
without
too
much
delay,
of
this
testimony
where
mr.

just
responded
which
you
rely
on?
justice

black
he's
talking
now.
he's
giving
the
contents
of
the
particular
paper
that
which
you
had
asked
to
be
produced?
justice

did
you
say
agent?

i
thought
that
was
an
attorney.
justice

yes.
justice

was
there
anything

--
he
says,
“i
indicated
in
my
memorandum
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
the
officer
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
he
had
told
me
that
he
was
having
marital
difficulty
and
said
he
couldn't
recall
all
that's
in
the
report,”
mr.
lindsay.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
why,
in
reference
to
the
crandall
testimony
and
according
to
your
strictest
idea
of
the
foundation,
this
wasn't
enough
here
in
this
respect.
a
witness
gets
on
the
stand
and
says
that
“i
told
the
fbi
agent
that
my
testimony
was
dishonest,”
of
course
that
brings
the
responsibility
on
the
government
right
away.
according
to
its
exigent
last
week,
it's
their
problem.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
their
problems.
you
have
that
statement
by
the
witness.
then,
they
declined
to
turnover
a
memorandum
when
they
asked
him.
then,
they
put
on
the
fbi
agent.
he
remembers
there
was
a
conversation
that
the
man
did
not
want
to
testify.
he
says
he
did
not
help
make
the
statement
about
being
dishonest,
but
that
he
made
a
memorandum
at
the
time
and
reported
it
to
the
officer.
he
didn't
remember
what
was
in
the
memorandum.
why
wouldn't
that
be
a
sufficient
foundation
in
any
kind
of
case
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
under
the
golden
rule?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
indicate
in
your
report,
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
“i
don't
recall
that
i
indicated
that
in
my
report”?
that's
about
the
--
emotionally
upset
so
he
didn't
remember
whether
he
put
that
in
there
or
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
witness
crandall
is
on
the
stand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
whatever
it
is,
they're
trying
to
show
that
the
government
had
information
which,
according
to
our
decision
in
the
gordon
case,
it
was
its
duty
to
disclose,
as
i
understand
it,
if
the
statement
of
matusow
was
correct.
to
the
effect
that
the
witness,
who
--
upon
whose
evidence
a
man
had
been
convicted,
came
to
the
fbi
agent
and
said
his
evidence
was
not
honest
and
the
government
has
then
opposed
an
objection
to
getting
in
the
memorandum
which
was
made
by
the
fbi
agent
to
whom
he
made
that
report.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
whether
it
did
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
asked
you,
the
government
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
approved.
meanwhile,
it
would
have
said,
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
“why,
we
think
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it
ought
to
be
in.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
when
it
--
when
it
came
out,
you
had
testimony
by
an
--
by
a
witness.
he
told
the
fbi
agent
that
his
evidence
was
dishonest
and
the
fbi
agent
that
had
asked
not
to
testify,
the
fbi
agent
said
“yes,
he
asked
me
not
to
testify,”
and
--
but
he
said,
“he
did
not
tell
me
or
deny
that
his
testimony
was
honest.”
now,
instead
of
looking
to
the
memorandum
which
might
have
shown,
one
way
or
the
other,
the
government
rests
on
the
court's
objection
to
the
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
why
do
you
say
--
why
do
you
say
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
understand
it
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
one
question,
mr.
lindsay.
as
i
understand
it,
the
judge
has
held
that
matusow
was
guilty
of
prejudice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
deciding
to
grant
a
new
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
the
motion
for
new
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
he
had
perjured
himself
from
saying
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
he
had
perjured
himself
with
the
first
testimony.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
shows
he
testified
in
both,
does
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
that
being
the
case,
i
would
like
you
to
add
in
your
memorandum
this.
if
he
testified
in
both
and
this
evidence
is
important
--
was
important,
as
it
undoubtedly
was,
that
he
--
whether
accumulated
or
not,
why,
under
the
action
we
took
last
week,
should
we
do
anything
except
to
reverse
the
case
and
demand
a
new
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
trial
judge,
in
other
words
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
the
trial
judge
found
there
was
corroboration?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
there
was
enough
without
that
to
support
a
verdict.
if
a
verdict
had
been
rendered
on
that
limited
evidence,
can
you
apply
that
rule
to
say
that
where
it
was
not
on
that
limited
evidence
but
this
purported
evidence
was
offered,
which
is
there,
that
the
judge
ought
to
take
the
place
of
the
jury
in
determining
if
this
man
ought
to
be
convicted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
you
would
have
no
complaint
in
this
case,
which
you
have,
while
the
trial
was
on,
after
matusow
had
testified
as
he
did
the
first
time.
he
had
then
come
on
the
stand
and
told
the
jury
that
he
had
lied
the
first
time.
the
jury
had
found
that
he
had
not
and
had
convicted
even
though
his
evidence
was
in.
that
would
be
quite
a
different
situation
to
this,
would
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then,
you
would
have
the
jury
passing
his
evidence
knowing
that
he
had
claimed
he
was
a
perjurer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
have
not
had
that
and
cannot
get
it
anyway
except
by
another
jury
trial.
