mr.
mcternan.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
he
say
the
record
showed
in
that
regard,
mr.
mcternan?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
say
that
he
did
not
put
anything
in
or
he
did
put
something
in?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
proceed
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
mr.
mcternan.
chief
justice
earl
warren
at
the
recantation
hearing,
did
you
ask
for
those
reports
again?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
government
objected?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
mr.
crandall
cross-examined
as
to
whether
--
whether
there
was
such
a
paper
in
existence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
sir.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lindsay.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
suggestion
do
you
have,
mr.
lindsay,
as
to
the
foundation
that
should
have
been
laid
by
the
defense
in
this
case
for
that
purpose?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
could
you
do
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
could
you
do
that
when
there
was
just
the
witness
and
the
defendant
at
conversations
and
when
the
only
record
of
the
--
of
the
interview
was
a
written
record
he
had
made
to
the
government?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
could
--
how
could
they
bring
impeaching
witnesses
to
show
that
wasn't
true?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
just
take
one
situation,
as
i
recall
it
from
the
argument.
i
understood
that
matusow
testified
that
he
had
a
--
a
conversation
with
the
defendant,
no
one
else
being
present,
and
that,
at
that
conversation,
the
defendant
told
him
that
he
was
--
that
they
were
going
to
have
an
alliance
with
the
communist
union
in
mexico
for
the
purposes
of
--
of
thwarting
the
korean
war
by
stopping
the
--
stopping
the
export
of
--
of
copper.
now,
i
--
i
understood
also
that
matusow
had
said
that
he
had
no
recollection
of
whether
he
had
put
that
into
his
report
or
not.
now,
if
he
--
if
the
man
was
paid
by
the
government
to
collect
evidence
and
information
concerning
communist
activities
in
this
country,
wouldn't
it
be
reasonable
to
--
to
believe
that
it
would
bear
on
his
credibility
if
he
had
not
put
that
into
his
written
reports
made
to
the
government?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
could
be
explained
and
go
to
his
credibility,
couldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
the
question
of
the
burdensome
character
of
it,
i
wouldn't
assume
that
the
government
would
try
a
case
of
this
importance
without
inquiring
into
the
question
as
to
whether
an
informer
of
this
kind
had
made
written
reports
on
the
same
subject
he
was
going
to
testify
to
and,
if
they
found
them,
it
wouldn't
be
difficult
to
produce
them
and,
if
there
were
no
reports
on
the
subject,
it
wouldn't
be
--
it
wouldn't
be
difficult
to
say
so,
would
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
would
you
carry
that
to
the
extent
of
--
of
the
witness
on
this
recantation
hearing
where
the
fbi
agent
--
where
matusow,
rather,
testified
that
he
had
given
a
--
a
written
report
to
the
agent,
the
agent
admitted
that
--
that
he
had
the
report
but
that
it
said
something
different
from
what
matusow
had
said?do
you
think,
there,
that
the
judge
should
have
refrained
from
looking
at
it
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
that
was
true
after
a
man
had
confessed
for
being
a
perjurer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
that
--
was
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
question
answered?
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
though
--
even
though
he
knew
that
matusow
was
a
perjurer
one
time
or
the
other?
even
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
at
the
trial
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
or
at
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
or
at
this
hearing?
he
had
to
be,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but,
this
goes
back
to
your
--
your
original
statement
to
the
effect
that,
in
a
proceeding
of
this
kind,
the
judge
should
take
into
consideration
character
of
the
witness,
his
demeanor
on
the
witness
stand,
whether
there
were
any
contradictory
statements
or
anything
in
determining
whether
he
would
have
a
look
at
the
--
at
the
records
that
were
disputed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
don't
you
think
those
things
should
have
been
taken
into
consideration
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
suppose
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
suppose
the
document
had
said
that
matusow
had
told
him
he
was
dissatisfied
with
his
testimony
that
it
--
in
the
grand
jury
that
it
wasn't
true.
suppose
it
had,
would
it
have
been
incompetent
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
it
have
been
incompetent?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
but
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
isn't
the
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
isn't
the
question.
you
said
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
it
was
an
incompetent
document,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
wouldn't
it
have
been
incompetent
if
it
had
contained
any
such
matter?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
you
find
out
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
witness
for
the
government
supported
his
oral
testimony
by
saying
that
he
had
taken
notes
and
made
a
record
of
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
crandall.
crandall
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
crandall
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
supported
his
testimony
by
saying
that
--
that
matusow
had
told
him
about
his
family
difficulties
as
being
the
reason
for
not
--
not
wanting
to
testify
and
that
he
had
made
a
written
report
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
of
that
to
his
superiors.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
lindsay,
it
wasn't
so
ambiguous
but
what
the
government
chose
to
put
crandall
on
the
stand
and
interrogate
him
about
it
on
the
theory
that
it
was
unambiguous
and
that
--
that
matusow
had
said
that
he
told
him
his
testimony
was
dishonest.
now,
the
government
interpreted
that
that
way
at
the
trial,
put
a
man
on
to
deny
categorically
any
such
construction
of
that
conversation,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then,
how
can
you
say
that
anyone
proceeded
on
the
theory
that
it
was
so
ambiguous
that
you
--
you
could
disregard
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
say
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
the
judge
did
remove
the
cloud
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'd
like
to
add
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
the
judge
was
accurate
in
that
finding?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
conversation
that
he
had
with
--
matusow
said
he
had
with
jencks,
to
the
effect
that
jencks
told
him
that
he
and
the
other
communists
on
this
side
of
the
border
were
arranging
with
the
communists
on
the
mexican
side
of
the
border,
by
a
strike,
to
stop
the
production
of
copper
so
there
would
be
no
export
of
copper
for
the
korean
war,
do
they
--
did
he
consider
that
inconsequential?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
now,
can
you
--
can
you
give
me
one
single
bit
of
testimony
in
this
--
in
the
case
that
was
more
damaging
to
jencks
so
far
as
advocating
violence
and
overthrow
of
this
government
by
force
and
violence
than
this
particular
testimony
that
i
just
called
your
attention
to.
chief
justice
earl
warren
any
--
any
single
piece
of
testimony
in
the
whole
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
anything
more
direct
then?
let
me
put
it
this
way.
is
there
anything
more
direct,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
against
his
participation
so
far
as
force
and
violence
is
concerned,
than
this
particular
testimony?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
isn't?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
isn't
the
point
you
were
trying
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know
but
you're
reverting
back
to
the
importance
of
matusow's
testimony
in
this
case
and
how
it
affected
the
jury
in
their
--
in
their
verdict.
and,
i
asked
you
whether
there's
any
more
important
testimony
in
this
case
in
that
particular
conversation
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
anything
that
connects
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
up
more
closely
with
the
defendant
jencks.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
--
do
you
consider
that
as
strong
as
this
testimony
i
just
pointed
out
to
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way.
how
did
they
corroborate?
how
did
they
corroborate
this
testimony
of
matusow's
concerning
this
conversation
with
jencks?
the
court
says,
practically,
all
of
it
is
corroborated.
what
is
the
corroboration?
chief
justice
earl
warren
never
mind.
chief
justice
earl
warren
finish
your
argument,
mr.
lindsay.
i
could
read
this
record.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
page
are
you
reading?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lindsay,
would
you
mind
giving
us
some
memorandum
as
to
what
course
you
think
you
should
be
followed
if
any
motion
to
produce
was
erroneously
denied.
and,
secondly,
if
the
motion
to
produce
should
have
been
granted,
should
there
be
a
reversal
or
a
man
to
the
trial
judge
to
pass
on
the
motion
in
this
--
in
this
case?
would
you
mind
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
produce
the
memorandum
for
us,
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
the
motion
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mcternan,
you
may
have
an
opportunity
to
file
a
memorandum
also
after
--
after
he
files
it,
if
you
wish.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
obligation.
could
you
do
that
in
a
very
short
time,
mr.
lindsay?
could
you
do
that
in
a
very
short
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
be
prompt
also.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
we
--
yes,
you
may
have
a
reasonable
time,
but
when
could
you
get
yours
in,
mr.
lindsay?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
have
to
have
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
put
it
in
printing.
you
may
--
you
may
have
it
in
typewriting.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
would
think
so.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
two
days?
give
two
days
to
you
plus
mailing
time,
mr.
mcternan.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
you
may
answer
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
let
that
stand
as
your
statement,
if
you
wish,
without
making
--
filing
a
memorandum,
mr.
mcternan,
just
as
you
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
