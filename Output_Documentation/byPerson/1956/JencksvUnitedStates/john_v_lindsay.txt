mr.
john
v.
lindsay
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
committed
a
prejudicial
abuse
of
discretion
in
denying
the
petitioner
several
motions
for
production
of
fbi
reports
by
or
about
witnesses
who
testified
for
the
government.
in
other
words,
what
are
the
tests
with
respect
to
the
discovery,
for
purposes
of
impeachment,
of
fbi
reports,
both
oral
and
written?
now,
if
the
court
please,
i
should
like
to
focus
the
court's
attention
as
to
the
problems
which
the
courts
are
faced
with
in
this
case
that
are
raised
by
this
case,
by
discussing
for
a
few
moments,
first,
the
fbi
reports
that
have
to
do
with
the
witness
ford.
now,
the
witness
ford,
just
in
summary,
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
until
september
1950
according
to
his
uncontradicted
testimony.
and,
he
testified,
his
latest
testimony,
so-called
pre-affidavit,
if
that
is
significant,
placed
the
petitioner
at
a
communist
party
meeting
in
august
of
1949
and
he
also
testified
that,
as
an
officer
of
the
communist
party,
as
a
member
of
the
new
mexico
state
board
of
the
party,
and
also
as
the
security
officer
of
the
party
for
all
of
that
period,
nothing
had
come
to
his
attention
up
to
the
time
of
his
severance
from
the
communist
party
to
indicate
that
the
petitioner
had
withdrawn
from
the
communist
party.
now,
ford
testified
that
he
reported
to
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
over
a
period
of
a
year,
beginning
in
august
of
1948
until
august
of
1949.
now,
at
this
point,
i
think
it
important
to
carefully
draw
a
distinction
between
written
reports
and
oral
reports.
ford's
testimony
was
that
his
practice
was
generally
to
give
oral
reports.
beyond
that,
he
could
not
recall,
on
any
specific
occasion,
as
to
whether
he
had
given
a
written
report
or
an
oral
report.
but,
we
know
from
the
record
that
his
practice
was
generally
to
give
oral
reports.
now,
i
know
of
no
rule
in
criminal
law
that
requires
the
production,
even
to
the
court,
of
a
memorandum
of
an
interview
with
the
witness
for
purposes
of
impeachment.
it
seems
to
me
that
his
ban
has
a
limited
application
under
the
civil
rules
of
federal
procedure.
we
know
that
in
the
hickman
case
that
it
was
even
there
stated
that
as
to
oral
statements
made
by
a
witness
to
the
lawyer
in
that
case
instead
of
the
investigator,
whether
presently
in
the
form
of
his
mental
impressions
or
memoranda,
we
do
not
believe
that
any
showing
of
necessity
can
be
made
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
to
justify
production.
and,
the
court
proceeded
--
this
court
proceeded
to
layout
the
reasons
for
it
because
it
puts
the
witness
on
the
stand
instead
of
the
--
the
lawyer
or
the
agent
on
the
stand
instead
of
the
witness.
the
practice
that
this
court
forces
the
attorney
to
testify
as
to
what
he
remembers
or
what
he
saw
fit
to
write
down
regarding
the
witness'
remarks,
such
testimony
could
not
qualify
as
evidence.
and,
to
use
it
for
impeachment
or
corroborative
purposes
would
make
the
attorney
much
less
an
officer
of
the
court
and
much
more
an
ordinary
witness.
now,
if
such
oral
reports,
at
a
later
time,
are
then
put
to
writing
by
the
agent
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
fbi
agent,
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
in
the
hickman
case
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
there
was
an
attorney
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
there
was
an
attorney.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
there
was
an
attorney,
justice
black.
and,
we
know,
too,
that,
in
subsequent
law,
that
the
--
the
civil
rule
with
respect
to
production
has
been
somewhat
cut
down
from
that
when
you
use
people
who
are
not
attorneys
in
--
in
civil
cases.
the
shoe
machinery
case,
judge
wyzanski's
opinion
in
boston,
i
think,
is
quite
revealing
on
that
point,
but
i
should
like
to
say
that,
if
the
production
of
an
oral
report
and
the
memoranda
of
the
interview
becomes
at
issue
for
impeachment
purposes
or
for
corroborative
purposes
or
anything
else,
it
is
much
more
appropriate
that
it
--
the
problem
be
considered
during
and,
if
the
fbi
agent
testifies
during
his
testimony
on
the
stand,
it
then
could
or
could
not
become
relevant
but
that,
of
course,
is
not
the
case
here.
now,
with
respect
to
oral
and
written
reports,
both,
the
question
here
is,
it
seems
to
me,
is
whether
there
shall
be
an
automatic
rule
of
disclosure
based
upon
the
fact
that
there
are
reports,
based
upon
the
allegation
of
counsel
that,
there
being
reports,
that
there
might
be
an
inconsistency
and,
therefore,
there
should
be
a
production
to
the
court
in
order
to
go
through
the
reports
to
see
if
there
is
an
inconsistency
between
what
the
witness
is
now
testifying
and
what
he
may
or
may
not
have
told
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
at
some
prior
time.
or,
whether
the
rule,
as
the
government
sees
it,
of
the
goldman
case
and
the
gordon
case
shall
control,
which
is
simply
that
it
is
within
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge
to
determine
whether
or
not,
in
the
circumstances
of
the
case
that
is
unfolding
before
you,
it
is
relevant
to
require
production
for
his
or
counsel's
inspection
of
the
so-called
report.
now,
i'd
like
to
say
right
here
that
we
do
not
--
the
government
does
not
take
the
position
that
there
must
be
an
admission
by
the
witness
himself
that
there
is
an
inconsistency
and
let's,
for
the
moment,
confine
ourselves
to
a
written
report,
signed
a
statement,
that
there
is
an
inconsistency
between
what
the
witness
is
now
testifying
and
what
he
said
at
a
prior
time
in
that
signed
statement
and
that
the
point
is
material,
and
so
forth,
to
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
accused.
if
that
is
the
case,
discretion
leaves
off.
production
becomes
mandatory,
not
only
to
the
court
for
inspection,
but
to
counsel
for
the
accused.
but,
short
of
that,
it
isn't
--
the
government's
position
is
that
it
is
within
the
area
of
discretion
for
the
trial
judge
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
has
been
an
adequate
foundation
laid
which
would
require
him
to
exercise
his
discretion
in
favor
of
the
accused
and
require
production
of
the
report
and
consideration,
assuming
it's
pinpointed,
for
his
inspection
or
for
counsel's
inspection
as
the
case
may
be.
now,
i
submit,
further,
that
the
record
in
this
case
will
show
that
the
petitioner
made
no
showing
of
any
foundation
whatsoever,
and
i
submit
further
that
there
was
not
even
an
attempt
to
make
a
foundation
for
the
production
of
these
reports.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
entire
argument
before
judge
thomason,
if
your
honors
will
read
that
argument,
at
the
trial
rested
entirely
upon
the
petitioner's
interpretation
of
what
the
second
circuit
has
held
in
this
regard.
and,
the
petition
there
argued
what
the
case,
as
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
make
it
mandatory
to
produce
any
statements,
no
distinction
made
between
oral
or
written
statements,
any
statement
made
by
a
witness
to
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
at
a
prior
time
upon
the
mere
allegation
that
there
may
be
an
inconsistency.
now,
this,
i
will
readily
concede
that
there
is
room
for
argument
as
about
what
the
position
of
the
second
circuit
really
is
on
this
point.
i
think
and
i'm
convinced
that
the
second
circuit
has
adopted
a
rule
of
practice
under
which
the
trial
judge
undertakes
to
examine
statements
of
witnesses
and,
in
each
case
that
i
have
read,
there
has
--
there
has
been
no
distinction
in
those
cases
between
oral
or
written.
i
assume
they
are
written
because
the
court
continually
talks
about
statements
made
by
the
witness.
now,
the
court
there
undertakes
to
examine
these
statements
as
a
matter
of
practice
but
no
case
yet
in
the
second
circuit
or
any
circuit
has
gone
so
far
as
to
say
that
upon
the
mere
command
of
counsel
for
the
defendant
in
the
case
or
allegation
that
there
is
an
inconsistency
or
may
be
an
inconsistency
that
there
shall
be
a
production
of
documents.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
think
that,
in
each
case,
it
depends
on
the
circumstances
and
the
facts
of
that
case
and
how
it
unfolds
before
the
trial
judge.
i
think
the
demeanor
of
the
witness
is
important.
i
think
the
fact
that
there's
been
a
vigorous
cross-examination
as
to
when
reports
were
made,
what
they
said,
who
the
agent
was,
whether
they
were
written
or
oral,
what
they
contained
and,
in
any
event,
whether
they
contained
anything
inconsistent
with
what
the
witness
is
now
saying
and
what
he
said
at
the
time
to
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation.
i
think,
further,
that
it
is
possible
to
lay
a
foundation
by
putting
on
impeaching
witnesses.
it
is
possible
to
lay
a
foundation
to
put
on
the
stand
witnesses
who
testified
at
the
very
event
as
to
which
the
witness
is
testifying
and
who
say
that
the
fact
at
issue
never
occurred.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
and,
still
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
i
didn't
--
i'm
--
i
misspoke
myself,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that
it
is
necessary
to
have
a
third
party
present
in
the
conversation
between
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
and
the
witness,
but
it
is
possible
to
have
--
it
is
possible,
in
some
cases,
to
put
on
the
stand
witnesses
for
the
defense
who
would
testify
as
to
the
event
about
which
the
witness
is
testifying
at
the
time.
in
other
words,
the
witness
may
say
that
there
is
a
meeting
of
the
communist
party
or
there
was
a
gathering
here
or
something
was
said
here
and
he
testifies,
if
he's
asked,
that
he
said
all
these
to
the
fbi
agent
or
that
he
wrote
it
down
or
the
fbi
agent
took
notes,
asked
him
to
sign
it,
whatever
it
was.
he
may
--
it
may
be
possible
in
a
case
to
have
another
witness,
who
attended
the
same
function,
testify
that
there
was
no
such
function
or,
if
there
was,
the
defendant
in
the
case
wasn't
even
there.
all
i'm
trying
to
suggest
your
honor
is
that
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
possible
to
have
a
showing
made
short
of
an
admission
by
the
witness
himself
that
there
has
been
an
inconsistency
made
and,
even
short
of
a
statement
by
the
--
by
the
fbi
agent
if
he's
called
to
assist
in
laying
the
foundation,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
possible
to
raise
enough
of
a
problem
in
the
trial
judge's
mind
so
that,
then,
he
could
say,
“now,
i
believe
there
has
been
a
foundation
made
and
i
would
like
to
examine
those
reports
myself.”
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
let
me
answer
your
question
in
two
points.
first
of
all,
as
to
the
specific
instance,
i
made
the
statement
in
the
early
part
of
my
argument
that,
in
my
judgment,
there
had
been
no
even
attempt
to
lay
a
foundation
for
the
production
of
these
reports.
now,
that
is
certainly
true
in
case
of
the
witness
ford
who
was
the
other
government
witness,
as
to
which
there's
a
question
about
production
of
reports.
now,
with
respect
to
matusow,
in
the
entire
record,
there
are
two
instances
where
matusow
was
asked
whether
he
told
the
fbi,
whether
particular
--
that
a
particular
event
had
occurred.
this
was
one
of
them.
in
that
connection,
i
should
like
to
say
this,
that
that
fact,
that
question
was
asked
after
the
motion
for
production
of
matusow
--
the
matusow
reports
had
been
made
to
the
court
and
denied
and
it
was
not
renewed.
of
course
when
it
comes
to
the
hearing
on
the
motion
for
a
new
trial,
in
my
judgment,
you
have
a
different
question,
and
i'll
get
to
that
in
a
moment.
now,
secondly,
i
should
like
to
say
this,
in
answer
to
your
question,
sir,
and
that
is
that
you
got
here
a
problem
that
is
much
more
complicated,
it
seems
to
me
in
this
particular
case.
these
can
be
classified
as
intelligence
reports.
now,
right
off
the
bat,
let
me
say
there's
no
claim
of
privilege
claimed
by
the
government
in
this
case
or
confidence
and
the
government
never
made
that
assertion
or
any
confidence
in
the
files.
but,
there
is
a
real
question
as
to
the,
i
think,
legitimate
position
of
the
--
of
the
government
that
it
has
a
right
to
safeguard
the
privacy
of
its
files
as
much
as
it
can.
intelligence
reports
of
this
sort
may
be
voluminous.
one
witness
may
give
them
over
a
series
of
a
period
of
time
which
is
very
long.
there
may
be
lots
of
them.
the
fbi
may
go
back
to
him
and
then
cross-examine
him
as
to
points
which
he
did
or
did
not
bring
up
which
may
not
check
or
do
check
with
the
lead
that
it's
got
from
some
other
direction.
in
the
smith
act
case,
i'm
told
that
it
can
cover
--
a
single
series
of
reports
from
one
witness
can
--
can
cover
an
extraordinary
amount
of
time.
they
may
be
written,
they
may
be
purely
oral
of
memoranda
of
interviews,
they
may
be
notes
taken
by
the
agent
at
the
time
and
then
he
dictates
a
report
to
his
superiors
later,
or
it
may
be
a
document
that's
been
initialed
by
the
witness.
but,
in
any
event,
to
require
the
trial
judge
to
--
on
the
command
again,
on
the
allegation
that
there
might
be
an
inconsistency,
in
any
one
of
those
reports
or
all
of
them,
to
go
through
a
series
of
intelligence
reports
of
that
nature
which
is,
in
the
case
of
the
grand
jury
minutes,
may
contain
names
of
perfectly
innocent
parties,
and
so
forth
and
so
on,
may
contain
investigative
techniques,
may
contain
all
sorts
of
things
that
have
no
relevance.
this,
to
me,
brings
the
trial
of
the
case.
and,
to
a
trial
within
a
trial,
you
go
down
side
alleys
to
witnesses
the
defendant.
you
get
into
fights
and
quibbles
as
to
whether
what
he
said
was
inconsistent
with
this
or
not
inconsistent
with
this.
it
may
be
in
my
point.
it
may
be
an
omission
which,
frequently,
can
happen
when
a
witness
or
potential
witness
is
--
is
interviewed
by
the
fbi.
and,
even
a
paid
government
informant,
he
may,
at
the
time,
have
a
full
recollection
which
is
--
which
is,
at
a
later
date,
refreshed.
so,
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
i
--
sure.
i
think
it's
a
--
it's
a
--
given
enough
time
and
patience,
i'm
sure
that
--
that
a
report,
an
fbi
report,
no
matter
how
remote,
even
one
that
is
oral
that
has
been
later
put
to
writing,
and
its
grandchildren,
the
report
made
from
the
report,
which
is
--
frequently
happens,
all
of
those,
i'm
sure,
can
be
explained
one
way
or
the
other.
but,
what
we
have
here
really
is
a
problem
of
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
and
are
we
going
to
tie
the
hands
of
the
trial
judge
so
that
there's
no
room
for
discretion
left?
and,
my
point
is,
this
is
what
i
keep
coming
back
to
and
emphasizing,
is
that
in
order
to
sustain
the
petitioner's
contention
in
this
case,
you've
got
to
find
an
abuse
of
discretion
and,
to
find
an
abusive
discretion
here,
you've
got
to
rewrite
the
rule
altogether.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
i
think
all
--
i
--
i
think
all
the
--
the
answer
to
each
question
is
yes,
that
before
--
before
going
into
a
trial,
the
government
attorneys,
of
course,
would
--
would
examine
everything
that
the
witness
had
ever
said
in
preparation
for
trial,
or
it
may
be
that,
in
the
case
of
a
witness
such
as
this,
reports
were
received
or
made,
may
they
be
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
written
or
oral.
it
had
no
reference
to
any
particular
case.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
in
other
words,
you
have
--
the
jencks
case
is
not
in
mind
necessarily
when
an
intelligence
report
may
or
may
not
be
received
which
may
or
may
not
pertain
to
--
to
mr.
jencks.
certainly,
all
of
those
are
analyzed
and
distilled
in
memorandum
made
from
those,
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
but,
i
cannot
see
that,
in
the
interests
of
running
a
court,
which
is
what
we've
got
here,
that
the
trial
judge,
who
has
at
his
fingertips
and
sees
the
case
unfold
before
him
and
has
all
of
these
factors
before
him,
should
--
that
his
--
his
power
--
his
discretionary
power
should
be
completely
curtailed
in
his
favor.
it
seems
to
me
that
we've
got
to
give
the
trial
judge
elbowroom
in
which
to
make
these
decisions
in
the
course
of
a
criminal
case.
and,
i
submit
that,
in
this
case,
as
we've
pointed
out
actually
in
the
hickman
case
with
respect
to
written
reports
even,
there
was
no
room
for
the
discretion
to
operate.
there
was
nothing
shown.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
think
it's
a
--
it's
a
good
question
and
it's
one
that,
in
preparation
for
this
trial,
initially
bothered
me
a
great
deal.
but,
i'll
say
this
and
i'm
completely
satisfied
now
that
the
crandall
report,
which
comes
in
issue
on
the
hearing
on
the
motion
for
a
new
trial,
i
think
perhaps
stands
on
even
a
stronger
footing
than
does
the
question
of
the
sweeping
request
made
for
all
reports
during
the
trial
itself,
and
for
this
reason.
matusow,
at
the
time
with
the
petitioner's
own
witness,
he
testified
when
he
was
being
cross-examined
by
the
government
that
he
had
had
a
conversation
with
fbi
agent
crandall
and
that
he
had
said
to
crandall,
in
the
course
of
this
conversation
with
agent
crandall,
“i
told
the
fbi
agent
i
didn't
want
to
testify
in
the
jencks
trial.
i
didn't
feel
my
testimony
was
honest.
or,
in
substance,
that
is
what
i
told
him.
i
didn't
want
to
ever
testify
and
especially
in
the
jencks
trial
that
was
coming
up.”
now,
right
off
the
bat,
there
is,
to
me
at
least,
an
ambiguity
about
the
statement
made
as
to
what
he
told
the
agent.
there's
room
for
question
as
to
whether
he
told
the
agent
that
his
testimony
was
not
honest
or
whether
he
was
describing
to
himself
a
motive
at
the
time
for
saying
to
the
agent
that
he
did
not
want
to
testify.
but,
that,
in
any
event,
at
the
time,
remember,
first,
that
matusow
was
the
petitioner's
own
witness.
second,
agent
crandall
was
put
on
the
stand
by
the
government
and
the
agent,
crandall,
was
asked
whether,
in
the
course
of
this
conversation,
there,
matusow
had
ever
said
to
him
that
he
did
not
want
to
testify
in
the
jencks
case
because
his
testimony
was
not
honest.
counsel
for
the
petitioner
immediately
objected
to
the
question
on
the
grounds
that
matusow
had
never
testified
to
any
such
thing.
further,
when
crandall
was
finished
--
when
the
government
was
finished
examining
crandall,
the
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
the
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
it
was
answered
and
he
said
he
did
not,
and
the
substance
of
crandall's
testimony
was
to
the
effect
that
--
that
matusow
had
said
that,
at
the
time
he
was
trying
to
affect
a
--
a
reconciliation
with
his
wife
whom
he
split
up
with,
and
that
the
newspaper
publicity
was
hurting
him
and
he
didn't
want
to
have
anymore
newspaper
publicity,
and
would
the
agent
please
tell
his
superiors
in
washington
that.
let
me
point
out
in
this
connection
also
that
the
report
--
so-called
report
there
made
was
an
oral
report
as
to
which
the
agent
takes
notes.
thirdly,
matusow
was
never
put
back
on
the
stand
to
clarify
the
ambiguity,
to
make
clear
what
it
was
that
he
had
said
or
not
said
to
the
fbi
agent.
now,
in
that
setting,
bearing
in
mind
underneath
it
all
that
this
is
petitioner's
own
witness
at
this
point,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
was
not
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
trial
judge
to
say,
“i'm
not
interested
in
the
report.
i've
heard
all
i
need
to
hear.”
i
--
i
would
like
to
say
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
matusow
had
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
had
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
in
that
--
in
--
in
that
connection,
this
--
i
mean,
this
raises
questions
as
to
whether
or
not
the
trial
judge's
holding
on
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
was
correct
or
not
correct.
the
trial
judge
found
that,
after
--
after
hearing
the
entire
story
unfolded
to
him
as
far
as
the
testimony
was
concerned,
that
matusow,
in
substance,
had
told
the
truth
at
the
trial
and
he's
lying
--
he
had
lied
at
the
hearing
on
motion
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
think
so,
but
i
--
but
i've
--
i
think
this,
too,
has
to
be
taken
into
consideration
that
all
--
all
that
petitioner
was
trying
to
do
at
this
point
was
to
bolster
by
a
completely
incompetent
document
the
testimony
of
its
own
witness.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
now,
i
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
in
the
first
place,
if
it
--
if
it
had
said
that,
i
don't
think
the
government
would
be
here
in
this
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
court
today
but,
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
in
any
event,
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
alright.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
alright,
but
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
no,
because
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
then
let
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
let
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
it
depends
--
it
depends
entirely
--
it
depends
entirely
on
whether
or
not
you
can
say,
and
this
even
is
doubtful,
you
can
say
that
a
--
impeached
witness
may
be
corroborated.
his
testimony
may
be
corroborated
by
a
prior
statement
which
otherwise
has
no
competence
at
all.
now,
that
--
that's
a
point
of
evidence
which
doesn't
stand
on
quite
the
same
strong
footing
as
does
the
case
where
a
witness
is
being
impeached
and
you
need
the
document
in
order
to
show
a
prior
inconsistent
statement.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
the
witness
for
the
petitioner?
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
crandall,
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
no.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
don't
--
i
may
be
mistaken.
i
don't
think
he
said
anything
about
a
written
report
at
all
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
when
he
was
asked.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
yes,
alright.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
alright.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
yes.
well,
i
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
--
it
seems
to
me
that
--
that,
in
--
in
this
situation
that
you've
described,
that
if
you're
going
to
--
if
you're
going
to
assume
that
a
witness'
testimony
on
the
stand
can
be
corroborated
by
a
memorandum
which
he
didn't
even
write,
you're
going
to
have
to
write
a
new
rule
of
law.
now,
i
--
i
think
that
--
again,
i'd
like
to
emphasize
the
difference
between
oral
and
written
reports
particularly
because
the
decision
in
this
case
and
the
court's
ruling
on
this
point
will
have
such
tremendous
significance
in
the
whole
area
of
criminal
law,
in
narcotic
cases,
and
the
rest
of
them
that
if
the
court
is
going
to
carve
out
an
exception
from
the
general
rule
of
--
of
--
insofar
as
we
understand
it,
the
accepted
rule
in
all
of
the
circuits
with
the
possible
exception
of
one,
and
that's
very
doubtful,
of
a
--
of
a
clear
showing
made,
a
foundation
made,
before
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge
is
shut
off,
if
the
courts
are
going
to
do
that,
i
think
it
most
important
that
it
be
very
careful
about
the
difference
between
oral
and
written
reports.
and,
i
think
that
it
--
i
think
it's
important,
too,
to
show
what
the
tests
are,
which
--
which
will
control
the
production
of
these
files,
the
opening
up
of
these
files.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
to
examine
his
trials.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
--
i
don't
think
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
don't
think
that
crandall
said
he
didn't
remember
whether
he
made
a
--
whether
he
--
did
crandall
say
that
he
didn't
recall
whether
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
what
he
put
in
the
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand
that
--
that
crandall's
testimony
that
--
i
don't
understand
that
anybody
is
trying
to
bolster
or
impeach
crandall's
testimony
at
this
point.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
it's
--
i
have
to
break
down
my
answer,
if
you
bear
with
me.
first
of
all,
the
government
made
no
objection
and
the
court
made
a
ruling
before
the
government
had
time
to
say
anything.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
that's
incidental,
but
i
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
but
i
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
yes.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
sure.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
sure,
alright.
secondly,
i
don't
--
i
don't
see
--
i
don't
see
that
the
trial
judge
committed
error
in
denying
this
request
after
this
highly
ambiguous
statement
had
been
made
by
the
witness
and,
matter
of
fact,
no
request
for
production
was
made
until
another
60
pages
later
in
the
record
this
highly
ambiguous
statement,
which
the
government
tried
to
clarify
and
petitioner's
counsel
objected
to
the
attempt
to
clarifying.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
if
that's
--
i
mean
if
the
petitioner
in
undertaking
in
the
setting
of
this
case
to
impeach
the
credibility
of
crandall,
you
would
have
a
different
picture.
it
might
be
that
--
it
might
be
that,
with
matusow's
testimony,
assuming
he
even
clarified
it
to
show
what
he
did
say
to
the
fbi,
with
my
--
i
keep
coming
back,
mr.
justice
black,
to
the
point
that
i
think
is
important.
that
is
that
the
setting
of
the
thing
is
all
important
and,
as
this
particular
event
unfolded
before
the
court
with
the
petitioner's
objection
to
the
attempt
to
clarify
the
ambiguous
statement,
and
so
forth,
plus
the
fact
that
--
that
matusow
was
the
petitioner's
own
witness,
whom
the
petitioner
was
seeking
to
bolster
with
an
intelligence
report,
i
can't
say
that
that,
at
the
time,
was
an
abuse
of
his
discretion.
now,
if
he
hasn't
got
the
discretion,
that's
a
different
story,
and
then
we
start
all
over
again.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
fair,
yes.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
--
i
don't
rest
on
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
say
that
that's
--
that
that
is
part
of
the
picture
here.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
the
other
part
of
the
picture
here
is
that
matusow
is
--
is
the
--
is
the
petitioner's
own
witness.
crandall
was
the
government's
witness.
there
was
no
attempt
made
to
impeach
crandall
by
asking
for
this
particular
memorandum
which
was
written
by
crandall.
now,
my
point
is
--
is
that
--
is
that,
whether
it's
good
law
or
bad
law,
perhaps
we
should
talk
about
a
judicial
conference
at
this
--
if
there's
going
to
be
a
--
what
i
mean
to
say,
if
there's
going
to
be
a
complete
rewriting
of
the
law
in
this
area,
which
i
think
so
deeply
affects
trial
courts
and
the
administration
of
criminal
justice,
let's
to
be
certain
what
we're
doing
here.
and,
i
think
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
i
think
--
i
think
that's
correct.
i
--
yes,
i'd
agree
with
you
on
that,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
but
i
would
say
i
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
i
think
that
this
ultimately
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
putting
myself
into
this
record
and
examining
what
happened
at
the
time,
and
reading
also
the
whole
sweep
of
the
hearing
on
the
motion
for
a
new
trial,
i
think
the
judge
acted
amply
within
his
discretion
and
correctly.
i'm
convinced
of
it.
i
think
--
i
think
that
if
--
i
--
i
fully
agree
that
you've
got
two
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
you
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
that's
right.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
correct.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
that's
correct
and
that
--
that
may
be
something
that
--
that
shouldn't
be
thrashed
out
with
trial
judges
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
and
so
forth.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
they
may
have
some
ideas
on
this
subject.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
there's
no
doubt
in
my
mind
but
what
you've
got
two
competing
principles
here.
you've
got,
one,
the
principle
that
you
must
do
the
utmost
to
secure
justice
in
every
criminal
case.
on
the
other
hand,
you've
got
to
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
and
the
appearance
of
justice,
too.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
after
my
preparation
here,
i'm
inclined
to
agree.
then,
you
must
also
--
then,
you
must
also
weigh
the
--
the
other
principle
which
is
that
you
cannot
lay
down
rules.
it
seems
to
me
that,
in
this
case,
in
order
to
sustain
the
petitioner,
you
would
have
to
be
a
very
sweeping
rule
in
this
area,
which,
make
convictions
almost
impossible.
now,
i
--
i
think
that
it's
a
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
i
--i
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
let
me
point
out
this.
here's
--
here,
for
example,
--
here,
for
example,
is
the
language
of
judge
learned
hand
in
a
case
involving
a
request
for
reports
of
results
of
government
investigators
to
his
superiors
in
the
department
of
justice.
now,
this
is
a
1920
--
this
is
a
1938
case.
it
isn't
quite
in
point,
except
it
is
to
the
extent
you've
got
oral
reports
here,
memoranda
of
interviews
with
witnesses.
and,
judge
hand
says
this,
“as
to
the
report
there,
there
is
not
the
slightest
showing
that
it
was
competent
as
evidence.
it
could
only
be
so
in
the
case,
in
case
it
contradicted
swaney's
testimony,
which
was
not
likely.
the
defendant
seemed
to
suppose
that
they
had
the
privilege
of
roaming
about
it
well
among
any
memoranda
made
by
the
prosecution
in
preparation
for
trial.”
that,
indeed,
is
not
an
uncommon
illusion
but
it
has
nothing
whatever
to
support
it.
my
--
my
point
is
that,
under
existing
law
and
under
the
record
of
the
case
here,
there
was
no
abuse
of
discretion
and
i
think
that
you
would
have
to
find
it
in
order
to
make
an
exception
to
the
general
rule
of
some
sort
of
a
showing
of
need,
foundation
laid
at
the
time.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
they
have
in
--
again,
i
stress
that,
in
each
case,
it
depends
on
--
it
depends
on
the
circumstances
of
the
case
whether
or
not
there's
been
a
foundation
laid,
and
--
and
it
may
be
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
that
may
possibly
be
but,
then,
this
was
in
the
trial
judge's
discretion
as
to
whether
or
not
he
will
exercise
it
in
favor
of
the
defendant,
depending
on
a
lot
of
factors
there.
all
i
say
is
that
--
is
that
the
trial
judge
has
no
choice
in
the
matter,
if
there's
any
showing
of
inconsistency
made.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
in
short
of
that,
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
exceptions
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
to
the
rule?
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
not
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
not
necessarily.
in
this
case
here,
if
the
trial
judge
had
ordered
the
production
of
these
reports
for
his
inspection,
the
government
wouldn't
have
claimed
error.
it's
within
his
discretion
to
have
done
it.
the
only
point
is,
when
does
the
judge
lose
his
discretion?
when
--
when
has
he
no
choice?
and,
he's
got
no
choice
if
there's
been
such
a
foundation
made.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
there
was.
there
were
--
there
were
two
separate
motions
made
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
with
respect
to
matusow.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
one
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
think
that's
a
--
i
think
that,
as
a
hypothetical,
it's
a
fair
question.
i
don't
think
it's
this
case.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
don't
think
it's
this
case,
i'll
tell
you
why.
at
the
trial
--
at
the
trial
itself,
there
was
no
question
about
matusow's
reliability
as
a
witness.
it
came
up
on
the
--
it
came
up
after
matusow
recanted.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
and
then,
there
was
a
very
serious
question.
now,
apart
from
the
crandall
report
which
we've
just
been
discussing,
there
was
another
series
of
reports
which
at
the
hearing
on
the
motion
for
a
new
trial,
there
came
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
there
should
have
been
a
reproduction
of
those
reports.
what
matusow
was
testifying
to
at
the
hearing
had
no
relation
to
anything
he'd
said
at
the
trial.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
with
respect
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
that
there
was
one
motion
made
for
production
of
fbi
reports
that
had
been
made
by
matusow
to
the
fbi.
again,
you
have
the
problem
of
oral
and
written.
what,
at
the
recantation
hearing,
matusow
had
said
that
the
fbi
reports
would
support
his
present
testimony
on,
that
testimony
had
no
relation
to
anything
that
he
testified
to
at
the
trial.
let
--
let
me
be
more
specific.
he
testified
at
the
hearing
on
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
that
he
did
not
tell
the
fbi
that
jencks
was
a
communist
or
that
jencks
had
identified
himself
to
him,
matusow,
as
a
communist.
number
one,
at
the
trial,
matusow
had
never
said
anything
about
jencks
being
a
communist.
he
had
not
said
that
jencks
was
a
communist
and
he
had
not
said
that
jencks
had
identified
himself
to
him
as
a
communist.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
that
--
that's
quite
true.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
that's
quite
true.
i'll
--
i'll
quickly
concede
that
and
i
--
and
there,
again,
i
come
back,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
to
what
i
said
before
which
is
that
--
that
if,
on
those
grounds
alone,
you
do
carve
out
an
exception
from
what
we
understand
to
have
been
the
general
rule
in
the
past
that
we
--
that
we
keep
in
mind
the
distinction
between
oral
reports
and
written
reports
because
they
can
become
very
remote,
extremely
remote,
and
the
other
thing
that
we
are
--
are
extremely
careful
that
we
set
down
some
sort
of
test
or
standard
that
is
livable
for
trial
judges,
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
workable.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
now,
i
think
that's
correct,
and
i
--
i
think
that
the
government
is
discharging
its
moral
obligation
in
this
case.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
now,
if
i
may,
may
i
pass
for
just
a
few
moments
to
the
question
of
the
adequacy
of
the
charge
to
the
jury.
the
charge
on
membership
is
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i'm
--i'm
not
sure
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
you
mean
as
to
whether
we
should
take
into
the
question
the
adequacy
of
the
charge,
and
so
forth?
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
don't
--
yes.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
remand.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
off
the
top
of
my
head,
i
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
haven't
thought
the
question
through,
particularly.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
but
the
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
alright.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
may
i
say
this.
may
i
--
may
i
preface
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
may
i
preface
the
answer
which
i'd
like
to
try
to
give
by
this.
there
is
another
question
here
and
that
is
this,
that
you've
got
two
sets
of
documents
here
as
to
which
there
were
motions.
one
pertained
to
the
witness
ford
and
that
is
the
one
that
i've
talked
about
initially,
and
the
other
to
witness
matusow.
at
the
--
when
the
hearing
on
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
was
concluded,
the
trial
judge
found
that
matusow,
substantially
--
in
his
judgment,
substantially
testified
truthfully
at
the
trial
and
had
not
testified
truthfully
at
the
recantation.
and,
he
found
also
--
he
found
also
that,
in
any
event,
and
i
don't
say
this
is
particularly
pertinent
right
now
but
i'd
like
to
just
point
it
out
before
i
go
to
the
question,
that
matusow's
testimony
was,
in
a
large
part,
corroborative
and
not
necessary
to
sustain
--
to
the
sustaining
of
the
conviction.
he
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
described
that
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
think
he
was.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
my
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
he
did
and
let
me
show
you,
if
i
may,
what
the
--
let
me
tell
you
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
about
that
very
point,
which
i
think
is
relevant.
the
court
of
appeals
said
there
is
another
point
of
difference
between
the
situations
faced
respectively
by
the
district
judge
in
the
flynn
case
and
the
court
below
in
this
case.
in
the
flynn
case,
matusow's
testimony
was
so
vital
and
uncorroborated
with
respect
to
the
two
defendants,
granted
new
trials,
that
the
court
felt
they
would
not
had
been
convicted
without
it.
here,
the
situation
was
quite
different.
the
testimony
of
matusow,
and
most
of
its
fundamental
aspects
being
merely
cumulative
and
the
facts
being
established
by
credible
testimony
from
other
witnesses,
what
he
said
concerning
appellant's
activities
in
the
national
association
of
mexican-americans,
commonly
referred
to
as
anma,
furnishes
a
good
illustration.
now
skipping
a
bit,
witnesses
ford
and
pearson
established
definitely
that
anma
had
long
been
an
important
concentration
point
in
the
work
of
the
communist
party
in
new
mexico.
ford
and
terrazas
corroborated
matusow's
partly
recanted
testimony
of
appellants
admitted
activity
in
the
organization
and
no
facet
of
that
proof
was
left
without
convincing
corroboration.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
i
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
think
that
the
--
i
think
that
you
got
the
--
you
can't
--
you
can't
single
it
out.
i
think
that
the
--
the
whole
sweep
of
the
testimony
here
is
--
is
a
--
as
far
as
jencks
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
think
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
there,
again,
this
isn't
a
force
and
violence
question
or
case.
now,
this
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
it
is
not,
your
honor.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
it
is
a
question
to
whether
or
not
he
told
the
truth
when
he
said
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
there
is
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
yes.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
there
is
substantial
evidence
by
several
witnesses
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
jencks
had
a
specific
test
which
was
the
recruitment
of
labor,
including
mexican
labor,
into
the
rank-and-file
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
on
the
issue
of
this
case.
the
--
the
question
--
the
question
here
is
whether
--
this
is
no
--
there
isn't
any
question
here
about
whether
he
should
or
should
not
have
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
the
only
question
here
is
whether
or
not
he
--
his
affidavit
was
truthful
in
saying
that
he
was
not
a
member
of
the
communist
party
when
the
jury
found
that
he
was.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
the
testimony
of
--
testimony
of
--
let
me
see
if
i
could
pinpoint
it.
testimony
of
the
witness
ford,
which
is
described
just
in
summary
at
page
9
of
the
government's
brief,
points
out
that
jencks
attended
the
meeting
of
communist
party
leaders
in
santa
fe
in
august
of
1949
to
prepare
plans
for
the
meeting
of
the
--
forthcoming
meeting
of
the
mexican-american
association
in
albuquerque.
and,
the
leader
of
the
northern
section
of
the
communist
party
in
new
mexico,
as
opposed
to
the
leader
in
the
southern
section
who
was
jencks,
instructed
all
present
to
give
vigorous
support
to
the
forthcoming
meeting,
and
so
forth,
but
not
to
be
conspicuous.
during
the
course
of
that
meeting,
--
during
the
course
of
that
meeting,
a
resolution
was
introduced
calling
for
the
association,
suggesting
that
proper
tactics
was
for
the
mexican-american
association
to
disavow
publicly
communist
support.
that
resolution
was
defeated,
in
the
presence
of
jencks,
by
jencks'
own
wife.
that's
part
of
the
testimony.
then,
the
witness
terrazas,
i
think,
the
court
of
appeal
has
discussed
that
testimony.
well,
i
don't
put
my
finger
on
it
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
right
now.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
we're
just
turning,
in
the
few
minutes
that
i
have
left,
to
the
membership
portion
of
the
judge's
charge
to
the
jury.
it
strikes
me,
in
studying
this
charge
and
particularly
the
judge's
portions
of
the
--
the
balance
of
the
charge
instructing
the
jury
to
--
to
take
into
account
all
of
the
evidence,
and
he
said
that
several
times,
that
the
standards
set
by
the
judge
coincide
almost
exactly
with
the
language
of
this
court
in
galvan
versus
press.
there,
the
court
laid
down
or
mentioned
what
it
thought
it
was
proper
for
the
hearing
officer
in
that
case,
that
being
a
deportation
case,
to
consider
in
arriving
with
the
conclusion
that
the
respondent
in
that
case
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
and,
the
charge,
it
seems
to
me,
here,
stated
the
necessary
qualifications
or
what
the
jury
could
consider
in
order
to
find
membership
in
the
communist
party.
in
particular,
the
court
mentioned
that
the
court
--
that
the
jury
could
consider
attendance
of
communist
party
meetings,
holding
office
in
the
communist
party,
as
to
which
there
is
testimony.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i'm
--
i'm
reading
from
page
416
of
the
record
in
volume
--
in
the
first
volume,
number
--
the
first
one.
attendance
in
communist
party
meetings,
holding
office,
engagement
in
any
other
conduct
consistent
only
with
membership,
and
all
other
evidence
which
bears
and
may
not
bear
from
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
was
a
member.
any
number
of
occasions
after
that,
throughout
the
charge,
you
will
see
that
the
judge
instructed
the
jury,
that
on
this
question,
to
take
into
consideration
that
it
must
--
it
must
take
into
consideration
all
of
the
evidence.
now,
on
the
question
of
the
portion
of
the
charge
dealing
with
affiliation
with
the
communist
party,
first
of
all,
in
passing,
let
me
remind
the
court
that,
under
concurrent
sentences,
if
the
judgment
of
the
court
as
to
one
is
affirmed,
the
judgment
in
its
entirety
should
be
affirmed.
and,
as
to
this
charge,
reliance
on
the
bridges
case,
i
think,
is
misplaced.
that,
being
a
violent
overthrow
case
and
a
necessity,
was,
there,
required
to
show
connection
with
the
respondent
and
a
party
advocating
violent
overthrow
for
the
government.
and,
the
charge
also
there
said
that
they
must
connect
with
--
they
must
find
the
defendant
had
connected
himself
with
the
communist
party,
had
adopted
the
party,
and
it
indicated
that
they
must
find
that
there
was
more
than
sympathy,
and
so
forth.
in
conclusion,
the
government
submits
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
be
affirmed.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
there
--
there
is,
in
the
united
states
attorney's
manual,
a
--
an
instruction
to
united
states
attorneys
that
they
are
not
to
disclose
fbi
reports.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
that
is
correct.
under
many
instances
and,
again,
here,
i
think
it
is
fair
for
me
to
say
that,
had
there
been
a
requirement
by
the
judge
for
production
here,
there
would
have
been
no
charge
of
error
on
the
government's
part.
we
think
it
was
a
perfectly
proper
exercise
of
discretion
under
all
the
circumstances,
and
we
think
it
was
a
correct
result.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i'd
be
glad
to
do
that.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
in
--
in
this
case
here?
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
don't
think
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
you
can
say
just
that.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
he
found
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
because
he
found
that
matusow,
at
the
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
at
the
--
on
the
--
his
--
you
--
you
have
to
concede
that,
after
he
have
--
that
after
he
had
the
motion
on
the
hearing
for
new
trial,
the
judge
found
that
he
--
he
didn't
testify
truthfully
on
that
hearing
--
at
that
hearing.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
alright,
sir.
i'll
take
care
of
that
in
my
memorandum.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
will,
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i'll
send
a
copy
to
mr.
mcternan.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
not
being
as
--
as
aware
of
