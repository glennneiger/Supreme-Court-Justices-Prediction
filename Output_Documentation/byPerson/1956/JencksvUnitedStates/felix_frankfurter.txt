justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
mcternan,
this
is
just
very
keen
which
involved
a
problem
--
the
problem
in
the
administration
of
the
criminal
law
in
the
federal
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and,
therefore,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
whether
you
have
in
mind
appropriate
or
necessary
--
appropriate
or
necessary,
with
a
few
regard
to
criminal
justice,
to
safeguard
against
using
the
claim
that
their
contradiction
of
witness
--
to
what
the
witness
had
said
to
grand
jury
as
a
basis
of
obtaining,
as
a
matter
of
cause,
grand
jury
minutes.
i
--
i
read
--
i
must
admit,
i
was
brought
up
to
entertain
a
very
strong
conviction
about
the
desirability
of
the
secrecy
and
non-disclosability
of
matters
before
a
grand
jury.
now,
so
that
--
what
--
what
are
you
to
say
about
dealing
with
your
situation
in
the
context
of
your
circumstances
and
not
enabling
--
not
having
any
ruling
on
it
--
to
serve
and
to
device
but,
practically,
calling
for
a
stop
of
witnesses
who
are
important
witnesses
at
the
trial
and
who
had
also
been
witnesses
before
the
grand
jury?
what
kind
of
safeguard
do
you
suggest
in
regard
to
that
problem,
if
i
--
if
you
--
if
you
agree
that
it's
a
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
our
job
and
not
yours
and,
after
all,
that's
what
counsel
is
for
because
and
likely
for
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
am
dealing
with
a
problem
of
which
this
is
a
manifestation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
ought
to
say
that
my
concern
about
the
speakers
of
the
grand
jury
proceeding
is,
perhaps,
as
much
input
that
they
had,
at
one
time,
not
or
little
to
do
with
him
being
in
charge
of
the
grand
jury
in
federal
court.
there's
as
much
concern,
if
anything,
in
the
protection
of
innocent
people.
if
he
provides
there's
nothing
to
talk
in
the
grand
jury
room
that
ought
never
to
see
the
light
of
day,
as
innocent
as
an
unborn
baby.
and,
if
he
could
just
talk,
that
if
you
want
to
open
it
up
--
not
nearly
tampering
the
cross-examination,
then,
ultimately,
you're
not
a
mischief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
--
have
you
adequately,
from
your
point
of
view,
stated
to
the
court
what
you
deem
to
be
a
good
showing
or
a
statute
showing
that
one
could
infer
there
probably
was
a
conflict
if
he
wasn't
there
at
the
trial?
you
indicated
a
minute
ago
that
you
--
one
would
want
some
manifestation
and
not
--
not
to
say,
“your
honor,
i'd
like
to
get
the
minutes
to
maybe
show
this
fellow
testified
to
this.”
you
said
a
minute
ago
that
you
thought,
in
this
case,
that
the
case
is
--
there's
sufficient
protection
and
concern
that
i
request,
in
that,
you
have
a
manifestation
of
probable
contradiction.
you
did
not
say
something?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
now,
what
was
there
that
should
be
only
adequately
to
say
that,
what
was
their
appeal
on
the
record
that
showed
the
chance
that
you
were
wrong?
it's
not
frivolous,
is
it,
that
you
didn't
testify
differently?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
get
just
what
--
i'm
just
believed
what
your
finger
are
manifesting
contradictions
or
indications
of
it,
except
that
he
was
--
before
the
fabrication.
you
mean,
in
the
case
of
informers,
there
ought
to
be
a
rule
in
the
case
of
informant
who
has
listed
in
all
the
documents?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
challenging
anything.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'd
like
to
be
enlightened.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
prove
his
testimony
wouldn't
become
a
wholly
innocent,
so-called
non
--
nonprofessional
witness,
it
wouldn't
have.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
volume?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
mcternan,
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
the
judge's
charge
on
membership,
and
what
is
a
member,
begins
at
the
bottom
of
415
and
contained
and
was
concluded
in
the
--
on
the
big
line
down
at
page
415.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all
he
said,
but
--
on
membership,
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
that
all
he
said?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
is
your
--
is
your
--
the
main
point
at
least,
the
specific
point,
that
when
he
said
you
may
consider
--
you
may
consider
whether
or
not
he
attended
the
communist
party,
whether
or
not
he
ever
know
--
whether
or
not
he
engaged
in
it,
the
main
point
of
your
dissatisfaction,
your
--
your
challenge
with
the
adequacy
of
this
charge,
that
that
would
have
been
made,
to
all
unknown,
the
jury
who
found
that
the
first
count
was
satisfied
if
they
found
that
he
attended
one
or
more
communist
party
meeting?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
that
--
and
all
other
--
all
the
--
whether
consistently,
membership
in
the
communist
party
and
all
other
evidence
that
even
though,
dramatically,
you
might
say
that
qualifies
that,
first,
whether
a
clause
has
too
vague
as
an
unguided
--
to
serve
as
a
guide
for
the
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
the
ultimate
question
in
this
case
rather
than
to
ask
the
others,
mainly,
that
we
are
a
whole
lot,
because
of
this
problem,
really
raising
the
question
what
affirmative,
if
you
please,
aggressive
responsibility
rests
with
the
trial
judge
more
than
to
be
a
monitor
there
than
in
an
ordinary
case.
the
very
judge
is
to
remove
any
question
of
trial
by
taking
an
active
position
to
see
to
it
that
there
is
no
problem.
don't
we
ultimately
get
to
that
question
in
this
case,
in
this
kind
of
a
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
you'd
allow
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
you're
justifying
it,
if
i
may
ask
you
this,
you're
quite
justifying,
from
my
point
of
view,
what
you
have,
in
the
hickman
case,
is
a
problem
of
the
declaration
and
you're
quite
justifying
it.
i
just
wonder
whether
these
are
comparable
to
whether
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
is
comparable
to
the
kind
of
consideration
that,
from
my
point
of
view,
as
you
know
my
concurrence
to
justice
jackson
for
the
united
states
would
be
there
expressed.
i
think
this
is
--
i
--
i
welcome,
as
you
said,
this
raises
far-reaching
questions
in
regard
to
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
in
the
federal
courts
to
find
an
example,
in
my
point
of
view,
that
the
federal
government
should
set
in
regard
to
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
amply
unless
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
unless
you
meet
the
standards
of
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
responsibility
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
you
indicated
them
in.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
can't
do
that
without
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
thrashing
it
out
now.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
appearance
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not,
too,
because
nobody
knows
what
justice
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
lindsay,
and
you
may
talk
about
motions,
i
think
an
example
of
motions,
there's
one
motion
in
this
conversation
that
was
overlooked,
namely,
wasn't
there
a
motion
for
the
contemporaneous
reports
of
matusow
himself?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
--
wasn't
there
a
showing
that
matusow
has
asked
the
question
of
character?
and,
i'm
not
now
questioning
the
legitimacy
of
the
trial
court
finding
that
he
was
dutiful
at
the
trial.
i'm
think
that
he
was,
but
isn't
--
if
you
have
a
witness
like
that,
isn't
that
sufficient?
one
entitled
to
be
sufficiently
worried
about
it
to
proceed,
whether
the
contemporaneous
report
--
after
all,
ever
weighed
contemporaneous
company
it
had
to
have
granted
at
least
that
motion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
not
this
case.
that
is
a
hypothetical.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
had
the
relation
of
--
of
rating
great
enough
trustworthy
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
trustworthiness,
not
as
to
specific
evidence,
and
i'm
not
suggesting
that
a
man
who
has
forced
one
to
report
enough
evidence
and
who
pulsated
quickly
may
be
telling
the
truth.
he
said
“bring
him
outside”
and
then,
he
did.but,
wasn't
there
a
sufficient
daubery
about
the
organic
untrustworthiness
of
this
petitioner?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
whole
tenor
of
his
testimony
was
put
in
--
to
put
him
into
that
can.
what
--
is
that
what
we're
speaking
of
into
what
he
was
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
question
of
his
testimony.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
may
so,
i'm
very
sympathetic
to
your
insistence
of
speaking
of
this
problem.
you're
insisting
on
the
importance
of
this
problem
with
all
of
the
insation
of
criminal
justice,
and
i'm
particularly
sympathetic.
it
does
not
occur
unduly,
not
been
served
the
discretionary
power
of
the
trial
judge.
i
suppose
they're
from
this
bench.
they
are
all
discussed
but
they're
all
incomparable.
they've
shown
a
large
power
in
the
district
judges.
they
alone
are
being
better
than,
as
you've
mentioned,
they
now
are,
and
i'm
entitled
to
the
bench
with
your
insistence
in
performing
your
duty
in
pressing
down
the
cause.
i
suggest
to
having,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
just
sick
of
these
things
as
a
perception
through
a
pigeonhole
to
find
a
pigeon.
when
you
deal
with
the
administration
of
criminal
justice,
you're
dealing
with
something
very
different
from
ordinary
civil
lawsuit
from
my
time.
their
issue
involved
a
touch
of
moral
responsibility
of
the
government,
in
a
way.
in
my
point
of
view,
there
are
hardly
any
here.
that's
because
they're
sensitive.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
think
you
are,
in
the
argument
you're
making.
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
the
way,
before
you
go
onto
that,
i
--
before
you
sit
down,
you
realize
you
both
deal
with
this
problem.
in
case
the
court
should
conclude,
and
i
need
not
say
to
you
that
that
was
me
or
what
i
think
is
all
it's
for,
in
case
the
court
should
conclude
or
one
should
conclude
that
a
particular
motion
in
regard
to
the
production
of
documents
should
have
been
granted,
what
is
your
recommendation,
what
is
your
submission
for
the
court
on
what
other
issues,
if
any,
could
be
considered?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
i
make
myself
clear?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
yes.
how
did
they
--
if
one
thinks
one
of
these
motions
should
have
been
granted,
that
would
call
for
a
reversal,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
would.
then,
the
question
arises,
what
other
issues
call
for
adjudication?
issue
that
you're
about
to
go
into.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
would
have
to
deal
with
both
of
these
bodies
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
left
in
case
one
of
these
motions
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
have
to
answer
right
now.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
gave
you
a
question,
i
believe.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suggest
you
leave
out
of
account
the
momentum
of
such
a
precedent.
it's
(a)
that
this
is
not
a
serious
problem,
that
the
only
thing
you
used
was
a
matter
only
been
made
an
obvious
case,
leave
out
of
account
the
forcefulness,
the
enterprising
feel
of
the
bar
in
criminal
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
said
this
is
a
bugaboo.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
--
i
understand.
i'm
suggesting
the
court's
precedence
and
i'm
also
suggesting
something
that
ought
not
to
be
left
out
of
account
that
we
judges
can
easily
rule
in
criminal
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
could
--
they
don't
--
it's
easier
to
rule
towards
not
to
be
reversible
error.
if
they
rule
in
favor
of
the
defendant's
motion,
they're
safe.
i
speak
from
experience
on
the
case
of
the
honorable
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
you're
observing
and
maybe,
on
the
coast,
they're
all
strong-minded
but,
on
the
east
side,
there
were
some
judges
who
were
not
strong-minded.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
you
do
not
minimize
what
you,
on
your
main
argument,
conceded.this
raises
a
serious
question
in
the
administration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pleaded
it
up
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
bothers
me
that
i'm
not
totally
happy
of
fully
attacking.
i'm
putting
the
responsibility
on
the
district
judge's
determination,
whether
they
had
contradiction,
not
giving
the
defendant
counsel
access
to
that
determination.
that,
in
itself,
raises
the
question
and,
sure
is
shooting.
the
extent
to
which
you
say
or
encouraging
the
district
judges
in
exercising
the
inspection
--
the
inspecting
power,
we
will
be
presented
and
certainly
are
to
be
sympathetic
towards
the
argument
that,
after
all,
that's
what
counsel
are
for,
to
point
out
the
force
of
an
argument
which
the
judge
may
not
see
but
counsel
may
see.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
full
of
ramification
in
this
part.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
how
could
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
often,
he'd
like
to
argue
with
the
court
and
say,
this
isn't
a
contradiction
when
the
court
might
not
be
as
sensitive
and
perceptive
as
counsel
is
saturated
with
the
implication.
