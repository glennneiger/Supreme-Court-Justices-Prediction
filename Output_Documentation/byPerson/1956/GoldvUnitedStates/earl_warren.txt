the

to
the

that
you

--
where
the

was
innocent
because
they
had
no
idea,
they're
investigating
a
juror.
suppose
it
had
not
been
done
in

posture.
suppose
they
have
done
it
for
the
purpose
of
investigating
a
jury
to
create
an
impression
on
them,
and
suppose
the
jury
had
exactly
the
same
reaction
to
it
under
those
circumstances
as

a
mistrial?

even
though
the
reaction
on
the
jury
under
those
circumstances
was
exactly
the
same
as
the
reaction
to
this
in
this
case?
