mr.
joseph
forer
if
the
court
please.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
believe
i
have
two
minute
--
minutes
left
and
in
those
two
minutes,
i
want
to
ask
the
court
this.
namely,
that
it
not
passed
over
all
the
issues
in
the
case
other
than
the
fbi's
communications
with
the
jury.
aside
from
this
fbi
episode,
this
trial
was
marked
by
numerous
other
unfair
circumstances,
those
were
intentional
and
were
not
unintentional.
if
this
case
goes
back
to
--
for
a
retrial,
they
will
be
repeated
if
this
court
remains
silent
on
them.
we
say
that
there
should
not
be
a
repeat
performance
in
this
case
on
the
retrial,
whereby
mr.
lowther
would
once
more
intimidate
a
jury
of
government
employees
by
introducing
weeks
of
lured
testimony
on
the
claim
that
he
is
proving
the
admitted
fact
that
ben
gold
had
been,
for
30
years
before
his
resignation,
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
and
we
don't
think
that
he
should
be
permitted
by
the
silence
of
this
court
to
wit
induce
the
jury
that
mr.
gold
is
still
a
member
of
the
communist
party
because
he
could
no
more
resign
from
the
party
than
a
soldier
from
the
army.
and
we
don't
think
that
the
government
should
be
allowed
to
use
manning
johnson
whose
credibility
and
veracity
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
they
found
themselves
unable
to
defend
and
who
is
a
self-admitted
perjurer
to
the
knowledge
of
the
government.
moreover,
despite
mr.
lowther's
highly
erroneous
statement
of
the
facts,
on
this
record,
there
is
not
one
shred
of
adequate
reasonable
evidence
of
guilt.
and
we
don't
think
that
petitioner
should
go
through
another
unfair
trial
without
the
protection
of
the
perjury
rule
under
misleading
and
vague
instructions.
we
say
that
the
right
course
is
to
direct
judgment
of
accordance.
