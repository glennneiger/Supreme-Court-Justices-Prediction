mr.
harold
i.
cammer
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
the
petitioner,
ben
gold,
was
convicted
on
two
counts
of
filing
a
false
affidavit
under
section
9
(h)
of
the
taft-hartley
law.gold
executed
this
affidavit,
which,
by
statute,
is
at
the
present
tense,
on
august
29,
1950.
he
was
at
that
time
and
for
13
years
preceding
the
execution
of
this
affidavit,
he
had
been
president
of
the
fur
and
leather
workers
union.
by
its
verdict,
the
jury
found
first
that
on
august
29,
1950,
gold,
as
he
knew,
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
and
second,
that
on
the
same
day,
gold,
as
he
knew,
supported
an
organization
which
advocated
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
force
and
violence.
for
about
30
years
before
august
1950,
gold
had
been
a
leading
member
of
the
communist
party.
this
membership,
he
had
always
openly
acknowledged
and
even
proclaimed
it.
it
was
common
knowledge
in
the
fur
industry,
in
the
leather
industry,
in
the
trade
union
movement,
and
elsewhere
that
ben
gold
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
between
the
enactment
of
the
taft-hartley
act
in
1947
and
may
of
1950,
the
union
had
refused
to
comply
with
the
filing
requirement
of
section
9
(h).
on
may
8th,
1950,
this
court
in
douds
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
at
the
union's
biannual
convention
held
two
weeks
later,
gold
suggested
to
the
union,
advised
the
union
that
in
view
of
the
decision
the
time
would
come
for
the
union
to
comply
with
the
filing
requirements
of
the
act.
and
he
stated
to
the
convention
that
if
it
adopted
his
resignation,
he
was
uncertain
--
his
recommendation,
he
was
undecided
whether
he
would
quit
his
union
office
or
whether
he
would
thereupon
quit
the
communist
party.
the
convention
voted
to
comply
and
gave
gold
time
to
reach
a
decision.
within
the
next
two
or
three
months,
delegations
of
union
members
called
upon
gold
and
urged
him
in
the
interest
of
the
union
to
remain
as
president.
on
august
24th,
1950,
gold
sent
a
letter
to
the
national
secretary
of
the
communist
party
in
which
he
said,
“dear
gus,
the
letter
was
to
gus
hall,
i
am
herewith
submitting
my
resignation
from,
and
severing
my
affiliation
with,
the
communist
party.
fraternally
yours,
ben
gold.”
five
days
later,
on
august
29th,
1950,
gold
signed
the
9
(h)
affidavit
and
the
next
day
filed
it
with
the
labor
board.
at
the
time
of
his
resignation,
gold
issued
a
public
announcement
of
his
resignation.
in
this
resignation,
he
expressed
--
in
this
announcement,
he
expressed
indignation
against
section
9
(h)
of
the
taft-hartley
law
to
which
he
referred
as
a
slave
labor
law.he
said
that
neither
he
nor
the
communist
party
had
at
anytime
advocated
the
overthrow
from
any
democratically-elected
government.
on
the
contrary
he
said,
communist,
workers,
trade
unionist,
liberals,
and
progressives
fought
for
and
appreciated
democracy.
that
was
only
the
profiteers
who
opposed
it.
he
concluded
by
saying
that
although
he
had
resigned
from
the
communist
party,
he
did
not
thereby
give
up
his
belief
in
true
democracy.
and
that
therefore,
he
would
continue
to
work
for
the
repeal
of
the
taft-hartley
law
and
for
the
reenactment
of
the
wagner
act.
in
this
trial,
no
witness
testified
and
the
record
contains
no
evidence
that
after
gold
had
filed
his
resignation
from
the
communist
party
he
had
had
any
communications
or
any
transactions
or
any
conversations
with
the
communist
party.
the
record
does
not
show
that
he
had
attended
any
meetings
of
the
communist
party
whether
open
meetings,
close
meetings,
secret
meetings,
or
that
he
paid
any
dues
or
that
he
carried
out
party
assignment,
submitted
to
its
discipline
or
engaged
in
any
conduct
whatever,
indicative
of
membership
in
the
communist
party.
neither
does
the
record
contain
any
evidence
and
no
witness
testified
that
after
he
had
signed
the
affidavit
he
said
or
did
anything
which
supported
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
force
and
violence.
nevertheless,
the
government
urges
that
gold
continued
to
be
a
member
despite
his
resignation
and
that
his
continued
membership
fulfilled
its
allegations
to
prove
under
both
counts
of
the
indictment.
in
other
words,
that
his
membership
constituted
support
on
which
he
was
convicted
on
the
third
count.
as
evidence
of
its
claim
of
continued
membership
after
the
resignation,
the
government
relies
upon
three
things
plus
some
additional
factors,
which
while
they
were
pressed
and
relied
upon
heavily
at
the
trial,
are
presented
now
as
make
weight
or
corroboration.
the
three
principal
items
relied
on
by
the
government
are
these,
first,
that
gold
having
been
for
30
years
a
hardcore
member
of
the
communist
party.
the
jury
could
infer
from
that
fact
that
he
was
the
kind
of
a
communist
who
would
submit
a
sham
resignation
from
the
party
and
falsely
swear
that
he
was
no
longer
a
member.
second,
the
gold
--
the
government
relies
on
the
fact
that
in
january
of
1948,
nearly
three
years
before
he
had
signed
the
affidavit
and
more
than
two
years
before
this
court
sustained
9
(h)
in
douds,
gold
had
attended
a
meeting
between
--
between
officers
or
leaders
of
the
communist
party
and
officials
of
some
left-wing
trade
unions
for
the
purpose
of
determining
what
the
point
he
has
added
to
harvey's
policy
towards
9
(h)
should
be
and
whether
the
party
should
give
permission
to
left-wing
union
officials
or
communist
party
union
officials
to
comply
with
section
9
(h).
the
government's
witness
who
testified
to
this
meeting,
testified
and
said
that
the
outcome
of
the
meeting
was
that
permission
would
not
be
given.
from
this
the
government
argues
that
there
is
an
inescapable
inference
that
because
for
a
deduction
or
an
inference,
that
because
the
party
had
discussed
in
january
1948
the
--
the
question
of
granting
permission,
it
necessarily
meant
that
if
permission
had
been
granted
the
communist
trade
union
leaders
would
have
then
filed
false
affidavit.
and
we
--
we
submit
that
this
is
a
surmise
which
is
no
better
than
a
surmise
that
if
the
party
had
granted
permission
at
that
time
to
file
the
affidavits,
it
might
just
as
well
have
instructed
the
trade
union
people
either
to
get
out
of
the
party
or
to
quit
their
union
office.
thirdly,
the
government
relies
on
the
testimony
of
two
witnesses
which
are
not
supported
by
any
facts
but
stated
as
a
conclusion
that
the
party
had
a
policy
of
favoring
the
submission
of
sham
resignations
and
the
filing
thereupon
of
false
9
(h)
affidavits.
to
these
three
main
items
of
its
case,
the
government
adds
the
following,
first,
four
of
its
professional
witnesses
testified
that
mr.
gold's
statement
that
he
had
resigned
from
the
communist
party
but
did
not
thereupon
give
up
his
belief
into
democracy
meant
that
he
was
thereby
reaffirming
his
membership
in
the
party
and
that
this
was
soapy
in
language,
so
that
the
resignation
meant
to
read
the
exact
opposite
of
what
it
said
and
was
thereby
a
reaffirmation.
now,
these
witnesses
--
of
these
four
witnesses,
none
of
them
testified
to
any
conversation
or
transaction
with
mr.
gold
except
one
who
had
last
talked
to
him
in
1929.
another
one
had
never
seen
him
or
met
him.
the
others
testified
to
having
seen
him
last
one
in
1940
and
another
last
1948.
and
while
these
witnesses
were
presented
as
experts
in
the
communist
party's
use
of
language,
none
of
them
claimed
and
did
not
assert
any
expertise
in
the
defendants,
in
mr.
gold
use
of
language.
the
only
evidence
which
is
in
this
case
is
that
the
defendant
was
very
fond
of
using
the
terms
democracy
and
true
democracy
and
that
he
had
frequently
used
them
in
the
deferring
to
the
government
of
the
united
states.
secondly,
the
government
argues
that
there
was
testimony
in
this
case
that
there
was
no
such
thing
as
the
resignation
from
the
communist
party.
there
--
there
is
no
such
thing.
you
cannot
resign
from
the
communist
party.
on
the
basis
of
this
testimony,
the
prosecutor,
three
times,
told
the
jury
and
in
considerable
--
at
considerable
length
that
membership
in
the
communist
party
is
like
membership
in
the
united
states
army,
the
united
states
navy,
the
united
states
marine
corp
and
the
united
states
air
corp.
and
the
only
way
you
can
get
out
of
the
communist
party,
just
as
the
only
way
you
can
get
out
of
the
armed
services,
is
by
being
drummed
out
in
court-martial.
of
course,
these
witnesses
--
themselves,
three
of
them
had
left
the
party
without
incident
and
official
f.b.i
figures
show
that
certainly
in
recent
times
tens
of
thousands
of
persons
have
been
dropping
--
have
dropped
out
of
the
communist
party.
in
substantiation
of
the
can't
resign
theory,
the
government
had
its
witnesses
testify
that
on
five
or
six
occasions
after
gold
had
resigned,
the
daily
worker
had
referred
to
gold
in
matter
of
fact
terms
and
without
abusing
him.
the
fact
that
he
was
referred
to
without
abuse
means
that
he
was
favorably
referred
to
and
these
ex-communist
witnesses
gave
that
as
their
opinion
that
if
he
had
resigned,
the
daily
worker
would
not
have
spoken
of
him
without
abusing
him.
now,
some
of
this
testimony
was
qualified,
some
said
that
the
daily
worker
would
not
have
carried
these
favorable
references
if
he
had
in
fact
broken
with
the
party
or
that
if
he
had
testified
against
it
or
if
he
had
denounced
it.
fourthly,
the
government
relies
on
the
fact
that
in
1951
--
in
1951
and
in
1952,
the
petitioner
had
marched
in
and
have
participated
with
his
union
in
the
may
day
parade
celebrations
in
new
york.
its
witnesses,
the
prosecutions
witnesses
had
left
the
party
before
1951.
and
before
1952,
the
ones
who
testified
to
this
were
manning
johnson
who
had
left
in
1940
and
john
lautner
who
had
--
who
had
the
last
--
had
any
connection
with
may
day
in
1949.
and
they
said
that
it
was
their
opinion
that
the
communist
party
controlled
may
day
in
1951
and
1952.
and
it
was
their
further
opinion
that
the
communist
party
would
not
have
permitted
the
petitioner
gold
to
participate
in
these
parades
if
he
had
in
fact
broken
with
it
and
left
it.
the
uncontradicted
evidence
in
this
record
is
that
since
1907,
which
is
long
before
gold
was
a
member
of
the
union,
long
before
the
communist
party
was
formed
in
this
country,
the
fur
union
had
been
annually
participating
in
the
may
day
celebration
and
the
new
york
locals
of
the
fur
union,
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
of
the
new
york
locals
provide
that
may
day
is
a
holiday.
this
was
the
government's
evidence
and
what
it
boils
down
to
is
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
had
been
a
long
time
member
of
the
communist
party,
that
there
was
opinion
evidence
why
its
experts
--
that
his
resignation
was
insincere
because
the
party
didn't
accept
resignation
and
because
no
one
(inaudible)
was
demonstrated
between
gold
and
the
party
after
the
resignation.
more
testimony
that
the
party
frequently
used
deceitful
practices
and
the
opinion
of
the
experts
that
the
resignation
meant
the
opposite
of
what
it
said.
now,
the
first
legal
question,
which
i
would
like
to
discuss,
concerns
the
applicability
of
the
perjury
rule.
subject
to
a
few
inapplicable
exceptions,
perjury
rule
requires
that
the
falsity
of
a
sworn
statement
must
be
proved
by
the
direct,
that
is
the
eye
witness,
testimony
of
two
witnesses
or
one
witness
plus
one
independent
corroboration.
the
question
about
the
perjury
rule
arises
in
two
ways.
first
as
judge
bazelon
pointed
out,
the
government's
evidence
is
circumstantial,
weak
circumstantial
evidence
as
this,
and
does
not
meet
the
requirement
of
the
perjury
rule
so
that
there
should
have
been
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
government
will
contend
that
its
evidence
meets
the
requirements
of
the
perjury
rule.
on
the
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
yes,
sir,
they
were.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
the
--
the
--
i
will
discuss
that
under
instructions.
we
did
request
the
trial
court
to
charge
the
applicability
of
the
perjury
rule.
the
trial
court
instructed
that
it
did
not
apply,
that
there
could
be
a
conviction
on
circumstantial
evidence
alone
and
exception
was
taken
to
that
instruction.
he
denied
our
request
to
--
to
instruct
on
the
perjury
rule.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
weiler?
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
yes,
sir.
we
--
we
cited
the
weiler
case
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
exactly,
yes.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
no,
your
honor.
i'm
sure
they
do
not
challenge
that.
now,
the
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
exactly
or
that
the
case
comes
within
an
exception
to
the
perjury
rule.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
the
so-called
nonobjective
exception.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
nonobjective
exception,
this
objective
exception
that
we're
--
you
say
i'm
afraid
or
i
was
afraid.
they
say
that
since
it
deals
entirely
with
--
with
the
subjective
--
subjective
statement
it
is
not
dissectible
to
prove
by
two.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
or
even
by
one,
that's
right.
the
difficulty
with
that
is
that
in
the
douds
case,
membership
was
held
to
be
an
objective
fact
and
something
which
would
be
proved
--
provable
by
directive
testimony
and
by
the
overt
manifestations
of
membership.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
yes,
i
intend
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
if
you'll
bear
with
me
one
moment,
i
intend
to
come
to
that
in
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
--
in
this
--
in
a
very
brief
time.
the
second
way
in
which
the
perjury
--
the
perjury
question
--
the
perjury
rule
question
arises
is
that
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
i'd
like
to
have
--
i'd
like
to
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
--
present
--
there
are
so
many
things
going
on
with
this
conviction,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
well,
all
right.
the
--
the
trial
court
having
--
having
charge
contrary
to
the
perjury
rule
that
there
could
be
a
conviction
hereby
on
circumstantial
evidence
of
the
instruction
if
the
perjury
rule
applies
was
error
under
the
weiler
case.
now,
in
the
--
in
hammer
against
the
united
states,
this
court
held
that
the
perjury
rule
apply
to
prove
a
falsity
of
a
false
sworn
statement.
even
in
the
case,
subornation
of
perjury,
he
pointed
out
that
falsity
is
the
corpus
delicti
of
the
offense
in
subornation
of
perjury
as
in
perjury.
now
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
yes,
it
did.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
well,
i
don't
think
it's
so
old.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
now,
in
the
present
case,
the
--
the
petitioner
was
indicted
not
under
the
perjury
statute
but
under
the
false
statements
act,
section
1001.
nevertheless,
the
corpus
delicti
of
the
offense
charged
against
the
petitioner
here
was
falsity
of
a
sworn
statement.
and
under
hammer,
the
perjury
rule
should
have
been
applied.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
yes.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
no,
this
--
no,
no,
that's
not
what
hammer
said.
in
hammer
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
no,
it
didn't
say
that.
in
hammer,
the
government
asked
the
court
to
review
--
to
reconsider
whether
the
perjury
still
had
continued
vitality.
there
it
was
a
prosecution
for
subornation
of
perjury,
the
government
tell
that
because
it
wasn't
perjury
that
was
under
way,
the
perjury
rule
did
not
apply
and
no
such
instruction
had
to
be
given.
and
this
court
held
that
the
perjury
rule
must
be
applied
and
the
instruction
must
be
given
in
any
case
where
falsity
of
the
sworn
statement
is
the
crux
as
the
gist
of
the
--
of
the
crime.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
yes,
it
did
decide
that.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
wherever
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
i'm
saying
that
in
hammer
it
said
that
where
or
since
falsity
was
the
--
was
the
corpus
delicti
of
the
offense
and
in
a
prosecution
for
subornation
of
perjury;
the
perjury
rule
must
be
applied.
yes,
sir,
that's
what
hammer
said.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
no,
it
said
--
it
said
what
i
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
--
just
represented.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
and
therefore
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
i
didn't
quite
say
that.
if
i
did,
i'm
sorry.
i
said
that
hammer
applied
the
perjury
rule
in
the
case
of
subornation
of
perjury.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
that's
correct.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
now,
the
government's
contention
in
this
case
is
that
the
perjury
rule
does
not
apply
because
this
prosecution
was
laid
under
1001
instead
of
the
perjury
statute
1621.
but
we
think
that
judge
bazelon
was
correct
when
he
says
that
there
is
no
reason
why
a
person
charged
with
perjury
under
the
name
of
false
statements
should
be
entitled
to
fewer
safeguards
and
the
person
who
was
charged
with
perjury
under
the
name
of
perjury.
the
government
says
that
since
prosecutions
are
frequently
brought
under
1001
for
a
false
unsworn
statements,
therefore,
the
--
the
perjury
rule
does
not
apply
to
1001
prosecutions.
but
in
this
case,
congress
by
section
9
(h)
required
that
the
statement
be
sworn.it
required
that
the
representation
be
in
affidavit
form.
therefore,
whatever
the
case
may
be
as
to
other
1001
prosecutions,
false
swearing
was
declined
charge
in
this
case
and
it
was
the
fact
that
the
statement
was
under
oath
was
in
the
essential
element
of
the
government's
case.
the
government
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
the
government
cites
no
cases
in
support
of
that
proposition.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
but
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
well,
yes.
i
think
the
wood
case,
united
states
against
wood,
which
is
the
source
and
origin
of
the
rule
in
this
country
way
back
in
1854,
i
think,
which
elucidated
the
perjury
rule.
it
was
a
case
which
involved
the
false
custom's
declaration.
and
in
that
case
and
in
the
context
of
that
case
the
perjury
rule
was
written,
of
course
there
were
cases
--
other
cases
where
the
representation
is
under
oath
and
not
in
a
judicial
proceeding
where
perjury
--
the
perjury
rule
apply.
now,
the
--
the
argument
and
i
think
it's
the
only
argument
which
the
government
--
upon
which
the
government
relies
in
support
of
its
contention
that
the
perjury
rule
doesn't
apply
is
the
fact
that
congress
in
9
(h)
provided
that
prosecutions
for
a
false
affidavit
should
be
under
section
1001.
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
show
that
congress
in
designing
such
prosecutions
under
1001
intended
thereby
to
repeal
the
perjury
rule.
and
that
is
judge
bazelon
that
pointed
out,
it
may
--
a
more
likely
assumption
is
that
at
the
time
of
the
enactment,
1001
contains
different
penalty
for
a
false
swearing
into
the
perjury
rule.
and
a
more
--
another
plausible
explanation
is
the
fact
that
congress
would
have
thought
--
might
have
thought
that
neither
draftsmanship
to
lay
all
prosecutions
for
misuse
of
the
9
(h)
affidavit
and
this
includes
the
filing
or
the
using
of
the
false
affidavit
even
though
not
made
by
the
affiant
under
one
statute,
1001.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
it
was
at
that
time,
your
honor.
at
that
time
it
was
and
i
--
and
i
think
its
quite
unreasonable
to
infer
that
when
the
congress
provided
a
more
severe
penalty
for
one
kind
of
perjury
than
it
provided
for
another,
that
it
intended
thereby
to
repeal
the
safeguard
--
the
ancient
safeguards
of
the
perjury
rule
without
at
least
saying
something
about
it
and
without
at
least
saying
that
that
was
its
intention.
now,
the
government
argues
further
that
the
perjury
rule
cannot
be
applied
because
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
petitioner's
resignation
was
sincere
or
not.
but
petitioner
wasn't
indicted
for
an
insincere
resignation,
he
was
indicted
for
falsely
swearing
that
he
was
not
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
that
he
did
not
support
an
organization
which
taught
violent
overthrow.
insincerity
of
the
resignation
may
be
part
of
the
government's
theory
of
the
case
but
it
is
not
the
issue
in
this
case.
and
the
existence
of
the
resignation
cannot
change
the
minimum
requirements
of
proof
which
are
needed
to
establish
membership
and
support.
we
submit
that
it
is
precisely
in
section
9
(h)
cases
that
the
perjury
rule
safeguards
are
most
vital.
experience
has
shown
that
accusations
of
communist
membership
and
support
are
a
prevalent
phenomenon,
and
that
the
government
witnesses
in
this
field
are
often
highly
unreliable.
this
is
dramatized
in
this
case
and
on
this
record
by
the
fact
that
the
government's
main
witness
in
this
case
was
manning
johnson,
who
testified
that
he
had
lied,
who
admitted
that
he
had
lied
under
oath
and
that
he
would
lie
under
oath
a
thousand
times
if
he
thought
that
that
was
necessary
to
observe
his
commitments
to
the
fbi
in
the
communist
party
case,
this
court
held
that
the
record
was
tainted
by
--
by
the
allegations
that
manning
johnson
had
perjuriously
accused
ralph
bunche
of
having
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
this
court
remanded
the
--
the
communist
party
case
to
the
board,
but
the
department
of
justice
prefer
to
have
johnson's
testimony
stricken
rather
than
to
defend
it
against
the
allegation.
in
this
case,
we
invited
the
solicitor
general
to
inform
the
court
as
to
whether
or
not
it
had
evidence
that
manning
johnson
was
a
perjurer.
the
solicitor
general
refuses,
however,
to
say
whether
or
not
the
department
has
evidence
that
johnson
has
committed
perjury.
so
we
have
a
situation
here
where
the
government
refuses
to
vouch
for
the
credibility
of
one
of
its
main
witnesses
for
the
reason
in
publicly
accused
of
perjury
and
at
the
same
time
argues
that
the
safeguards
--
the
traditional
safeguards
for
one
accused
of
false
swearing
should
be
discarded.
we
contend
further
that
even
without
reference
to
the
perjury
rule,
the
evidence
was
--
is
insufficient
to
sustain
this
conviction.
the
government's
case
consists
of
membership,
as
i
have
said,
before
august
24,
1950,
plus
the
opinion
evidence
which
impugns
the
sincerity
of
the
resignation.
even
if
this
opinion
evidence
prove
that
the
resignation
was
insincere,
it
does
not
prove
post
affidavit
membership
or
support.proof
of
that
insincere
resignation
proves
only
that
the
petitioner
was
a
member
on
the
day
he
resigned
and
during
the
period
before
he
resigned.
but
it
does
not
prove
membership
after
august
29,
1950.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
there
is
no
permissible
inference
in
view
of
the
presumption
of
innocence.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
there
is
no
inference
possible
of
continued
membership
once
he
had
signed
an
affidavit.
the
mere
fact
that
he
had
been
a
member
before,
and
a
valid
member
and
he
signs
an
affidavit,
no
longer
permits
of
any
inference
that
he
has
--
that
he's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
--
after
he
had
signed
an
affidavit.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
well,
before
the
jury
could
find
this,
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
think
it's
going
to
have
some
evidence,
any
evidence
of
post
affidavit
membership
before
it
can
say
that
the
resignation
is
insincere.
you
can't
say
he's
a
member
because
his
resignation
is
insincere.
you
can
say
his
resignation
is
insincere
because
there
was
evidence
of
continued
membership,
but
there
must
be
some
evidence,
any
evidence
to
show
post
affidavit
membership
activity
which
does
not
exist
in
this
case.
we
have
purely
the
opinion
of
the
experts,
so
the
mind
readers
that
his
resignation
was
insincere.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
that's
correct,
it
did
come
from
him.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
well,
contemporaneously
before
it
occurred
with
his
resignation,
he
resigned
august
24.
he
signed
the
affidavit
august
29.
contemporaneously
with
his
resignation
he
--
he
issued
his
public
announcement.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
well,
then
you
have
an
insincere
resignation
but
it
doesn't
prove
post
affidavit
membership.
may
i
--
suppose
on
new
year's
day,
i
insincerely
say
i'm
going
to
stop
smoking,
and
i've
been
a
heavy
smoker
until
on
that
date.
now,
that
is
an
insincere
statement.
does
that
prove
that
i
have
continued
to
smoke
without
some
evidence
that
i
smoked
the
next
day?
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
you
--
you
can
commit
insincerity,
but
i
don't
think
insincerity
is
perjury.
now,
the
--
the
point
of
the
government's
case
is
that
where
it
--
where
it
has
proved
in
this
case,
where
it
had
admitted
past
membership,
the
burden
of
proof
in
some
way
shifted
to
the
petitioner
to
prove
that
he
was
no
longer
a
member.
this
is
an
impermissible
transfer
of
the
burden
of
proof.
it's
inconsistent
with
the
presumption
of
innocence
which
prevailed.
it's
inconsistent
with
the
affidavit
which
he
filed,
and
that's
inconsistent
with
the
assurance,
which
this
court
made
in
the
douds
case,
that
there
is
no
one
who
may
not,
at
any
time,
quit
the
disqualifying
alliances,
quit
his
membership
in
the
communist
party
to
qualify
thereby
to
sign
the
affidavit.
not
only
was
the
government's
membership
insufficient,
in
our
view,
but
it
was
also
inadmissible.
first,
there
was
evidence,
weeks
and
weeks
of
evidence,
going
back
to
the
1920's
and
concentrating
around
the
1920's
and
1930's
that
the
petitioner
had
been,
what
he
always
said
he
had
been,
a
member
of
the
communist
party
for
30
years.

at
the
--
in
his
pretrial
papers,
motion
papers
at
the
outset
of
the
trial
and
this
whole
thing
to
the
jury,
the
--
the
petitioner
said
that
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
for
30
years
and
offer
to
stipulate
that
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
the
prosecutor
refused
the
stipulation,
and
instead
introduced
volumes,
literally
volumes
of
(inaudible)
testimony
about
petitioner's
experiences
in
moscow
and
in
the
party,
in
the
1920's
and
early
1930's,
to
prove
that
he
--
that
the
petitioner
had
been
a
long
time
member
of
the
communist
party.
the
trial
judge
should
never
have
permitted
this
--
this
course,
and
the
only
purpose
of
this
testimony
and
the
only
result
of
it
was
to
inflame
and
to
intimidate
the
jury.
more
pair
less
evidence
be
justified
on
a
theory
that
it
was
being
introduced
in
support
of
the
third
count
to
show
that
the
communist
party
taught
violent
overthrow.
in
the
first
place,
it
was
introduced
and
admitted
only
for
the
limited
purpose
of
showing
petitioner's
past
membership.
it
was
not
offered
in
support
of
the
third
count
to
prove
the
doctrine
violent
overthrow.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
about

about
2000
pages
of
--
of
transcript.
we
don't
think
that
the
evidence
of
his
past
membership
can
be
justified
now
on
the
theory
that
it
was
introduced
in
support
of
the
support
count.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
he
did
not.
the
second
good
part
of
this
evidence
had
nothing
to
do
with
even
the
third
count,
because
it
related
to
matters
and
periods
which
were
remote
from
--
from
august
1950.
and
even
if
they
weren't
remote,
there
was
such
testimony,
for
example,
that
in
1926
he
had
participated
in
the
bidding
of
a
striker,
of
a
(inaudible)
and
of
an
employer,
and
that
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
even
the
third
count.
the
opinion
testimony
of
the
ex-communist
witnesses
was
also
irrelevant
and
calculated
to
confuse
the
jury.
the
government
now
concedes
that
any
party
policy
against
resignation
couldn't
bar
petitioner
from
resigning.
that
if
the
communist
party
had
a
can't
resign
rule,
that
wouldn't
have
prevented
the
resignation.
in
fact
if
a
member
can't
resign
then
9
(h)
would
be
a
bill
of
attainder.
nevertheless,
the
prosecutor
promoted
a
conviction
by
--
are
they
impermissible?
and
even
the
unconstitutional
argument
by
telling
the
jury
time
and
time
again
that
the
petitioner
could
not
resign
because
of
the
can't
resign
rule,
that
he
couldn't
resign
anymore
than
soldiers
can
resign
from
the
united
states
army.
and
the
trial
court
refused
to
correct
this
argument
by
instructing
the
jury
that
the
can't
resign
rule
--
by
refusing
to
instruct
the
jury
that
the
can't
resign
rule
didn't
bar
a
resignation.
one
testimony,
the
testimony
of
the
so-called
expert
that
the
petitioner's
resignation
statement
meant
the
opposite
of
what
it
says
was
likewise
inadmissible.
these
witnesses
weren't
qualified
as
experts
on
the
defendant's
use
of
language
even
if
they
--
assuming
that
they
were
experts
on
the
party
use
of
language.
and
they
could
no
more
--
they
couldn't
say
that
the
defendant,
inviting
as
he
did,
meant
thereby
to
say
as
they
testified.
what
he
is
saying
here
--
what
he
means
here
they
said
is
that
i
am
a
communist
and
i
will
always
remain
a
communist,
and
that
testimony
was

was
admitted

want
to
pass
over
various
other
points
in
order
to
deal
with
the
error
in
refusing
to
mistrial
because
of
an
fbi
agent's
tampering
with
the
jury
during
the
trial.
in
march
1954,
while
the
trial
of
this
case
was
in
progress,
the
united
states
attorney's
office
in
the
district
asked
the
fbi
to
investigate
whether
perspective
jurors
on
the
master
jury
list
had
been
receiving
literature
pertaining
to
the
case
of
one
hugh
bryson.
bryson
was
then
under
indictment,
for
a
false
9
(h)
affidavit.
bryson's
case
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
gold's
case
and
gold
had
no
connection
with
any
literature
on
bryson's
case.
unfortunately,
no
one
told
the
fbi
to
stay
away
from
seating
jurors.
at
9:30
o'clock
in
the
evening,
an
fbi
agent
named
smazel
called
juror
morton,
a
government
employee.
according
to
morton
and
obviously,
the
important
thing
is
the
impression
the
jurors
got
as
to
what
smazel
said,
not
smazel's
version
of
what
he
said
he
said.
according
to
morton,
smazel
identified
himself
as
being
from
the
fbi,
he
said
he
knew
morton
was
on
the
jury
panel,
told
them
that
somebody
had
tried
to
get
next
to
the
jurors
by
sending
propaganda
literature
to
their
homes
and
asked
morton
whether
he
had
gotten
any.
that
same
night,
the
fbi
agent
called
the
home
of
juror
abrams,
abrams
wasn't
home
so
he
spoke
to
mrs.
abrams.
when
abrams
got
home
close
to
midnight,
his
wife
told
him
that
the
fbi
had
called
to
find
out
whether
he
had
received
any
communist
literature.
the
next
day,
the
fbi
agent
went
to
the
home
of
juror
(inaudible)
wasn't
home
so
he
spoke
to
(inaudible)
wife
and
children.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
pardon?
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
this
was
during
the
fourth
week
of
the
trial
while
budenz
was
on
the
stand
and
--
and
after
the
jury
had
been
hearing
about
hanging
from
the
trees,
how
the
communist
were
--
who
are
ready
to
--
to
hang
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
yes,
that's
right.
the
fbi
agent
spoke
to
(inaudible)
wife
and
children,
and
when
(inaudible)
got
home
she
told
him
that
the
fbi
had
been
over
to
ask
if
he
had
received
any
mail
on
the
gold
case.
and
--
and
the
fbi
agent
had
also
said
that
they
had
to
be
careful
because
in
cases
such
as
this,
they
were
sometimes
tampering
with
the
jury,
and
the
wife
had
the
impression
that
he
was
talking
about
the
gold
case.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
yes,
it
did
happen.
the
--
the
witness
so
testified
(inaudible).
the
--
the
(inaudible)
so
testified.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
well,
no,
there
was
no
denial.
smazel
said
that
he
had
--
that
he
had
been
in
there
to
ask
about
the
bryson
case,
but
he
hadn't
asked
about
the
old
case.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
yes.
juror
raver
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
there
was
a
conference
in
chambers,
your
honor,
of
which
the
--
incidentally,
the
defendant
was
not
present
but
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
no,
all
right.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
all
right.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
in
this
chamber
conference?
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
i
beg
you
pardon?
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
well,
not
--
not
the
prosecutor
in
this
case,
not
mr.
lowther.
the
prosecutor
who's
in
the
bryson
case,
who
had
instructed
the
fbi
to
find
out
about
the
bryson
activity.
it
came
in
and
laid
an
explanation
and
said
he
was
sorry
that
it
happened,
perhaps
as
--
perhaps
he
hadn't
been
this
careful
as
he
should
have
been
in
--
in
issuing
instructions
to
the
fbi.
and
the
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
no,
he
was
not.
the
fbi
was
conducting
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
he
happened
to
be
a
juror
on
this
case,
that's
right.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
well,
they
--
it
all
happened
together.
the
united
states
attorney
brought
it
to
the
attention
of
the
court
and
one
of
the
juror
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
a
juror.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
the
juror
was
so
scared
he
hired
a
lawyer
to
find
out
what
was
happening
to
him.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
he
spoke
to
the
fbi.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
the
juror
came
with
his
lawyer
to
the
fbi
to
say,
“what
is
all
this
about?are
you
after
me?”
and
the
fbi
then
reported
it
to
the
united
states
attorney.
the
united
states
attorney
reported
it
to
the
court.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
that's
right,
and
then
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
that's
right.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
no,
he
was
excused.
this
juror
said
he
was
too
scared
to
continue
as
a
juror,
so
he
was
excused.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
well,
after
this
had
happened,
he
was
excused.he
had
sat
for
four
weeks
as
a
juror
in
this
case.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
yes.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
there
were
two
alternates.
one
of
the
alternates
was
put
in
his
place
and
then
this
alternate
said
he
would
rather
not
sit
too,
so
they
then
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
he
said
he
was
uncomfortable
about
--
about
it.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
well,
the
court
then
called
in
all
the
jurors,
one
at
the
time
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
all
right.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
the
court
called
in
the
jurors,
all
the
jurors
and
questioned
them
one
at
a
time.
five
of
them
said
that
they
had
heard
something
about
it.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
serialy
--
yes,
one
by
one.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
they
had
heard
that
the
fbi
--
they
didn't
say
what
the
--
we
--
well,
we
did
not
participate
in
the
questioning,
and
we
objected
to
this
inquiry
because
they
were
in
the
midst
of
a
trial
and
we
were
put
in
the
situation
of
having
to
interrogate
jurors.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
we
certainly
did.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
in
chambers
and
again
in
open
court.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
that's
right.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
well,
i
don't
know
whom
the
fbi
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
well,
they
--
they
--
i
think
they
were
investigating
the
whole
jury
list
to
find
out
whether
bryson
or
someone
in
bryson's
behalf
had
circulated
literature
about
bryson
to
the
juror.
this
had
originated
because
someone
on
the
master
jury
list
had
come
to
the
u.s.
attorney
and
said,
“look
i
have
received
this
literature.”
and
then
the
u.s.
attorney
ordered
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
yes.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
i
don't
know
who
he
was.
how
--
how
this
came
to
the
attention
that
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
there
were
three
jurors
who
were
approached,
(inaudible),
morton,
and
abrams.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
no,
abrams
got
out
--
was
--
was
removed
at
his
request
and
(inaudible)
and
morton
continued
to
sit.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
they
did.
they
did,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
well,
it
was
on
the
thursday
in
march.
it
was
on
the
thursday
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
i
--
i'll
have
to
notify
you
later
about
that.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
very
well.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
he
did.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
he
said
--
he
said
that
the
case
--
he
said
he
was
a
government
employee
and
the
case
concerned
communism,
he
hadn't
realized
its
implications,
he
would
be
uncomfortable,
and
he
would
to
please
be
removed.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
it
was
made
in
chambers.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
yes,
it
was.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
well,
he
was
removed.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
he
was
excused
and
he
was
replaced
by
a
government
employee.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
he
had
not
been
approached.
he
had
heard
of
this.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
it
does.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
he
had
very
--
when
--
when
these
jurors
came
in
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
among
the
jurors.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
well,
the
record
doesn't
appear.
the
record
doesn't
disclose
that,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
the
record
does
not
disclose.
the
record
simply
shows
that
five
jurors
had
heard
that
there
had
been
--
that
an
fbi
agent
had
contacted
or
made
some
inquiries
about
the
case.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
no
explanation
was
ever
given
by
the
court
to
the
jurors
even
though
we
asked
the
court
to
explain,
because
of
press
accounts
that
appeared
and
which
imply
that
we
have
been
guilty
of
jury
tampering,
we
asked
the
court
to
make
some
explanation
of
the
fact
that
we'd
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
what
had
developed
between
the
fbi
and
the
jurors.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
well,
three
--
two
of
them
knew
it
certainly
because
they
had
been
approached
themselves.
two
of
those
who
sat
and
rendered
the
verdict
knew
it.
five
others
testified
that
they
had
heard
something
about
the
fbi
being
interested
in
the
jurors.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
two,
morton
and
(inaudible).
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
five
of
the
jurors
who
sat
and
rendered
the
verdict
heard
--
had
heard
from
these
jurors.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
from
the
other
two,
that
the
--
or
three,
that
the
fbi
had
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
three
--
three
jurors
had
been
approached
by
the
fbi.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
well,
three.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
of
the
three,
one
was
removed
because
he
said
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
that
left
two.
now,
the
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
they
sat
and
rendered
the
verdict.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
they
did,
yes.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
now,
five
more
of
those
who
sat
learned
from
either
the
three
or
the
two
who
were
approached
that
they
had
been
approached
by
the
fbi.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
yes,
he
was.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
he
examined
them
all.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
he
examined
them
all
one
by
one,
and
he
asked
each
and
everyone
whether
they
felt
that
what
they
had
heard,
whatever
it
was,
they
were
never
asked
what
they
had
heard,
had
impaired,
in
their
opinion,
their
ability
to
render
a
fair
and
impartial
verdict.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
that's
right.
and
they
all
said
yes,
it
had
not
impaired.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
it
happened
in
the
fourth
week
of
the
trial,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
march
1954,
that's
correct.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
they
were
called
in
one
at
a
time.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
well,
we
don't
know.
the
fbi
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
oh,
no,
nothing
--
nothing
at
all.
nothing
developed
as
far
as
that
is
concerned.
no
juror
said
that
he
had
received
any
material
and
as
far
as
we
know
only
one
person
on
the
list
had
received
material
at
all.
now,
in
this
court
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
i
have
so.
well,
we
think
that
in
view
of
the
remmer
case,
the
recent
remmer
cases
and
the
rule
of
this
court
in
mattox
which
was
reaffirmed
in
the
remmer
cases.
this
fbi
interference
with
the
jurors
in
the
middle
of
the
trial
deprived
the
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
--
petitioner
of
any
possibility
of
a
fair
trial.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
answer
to
that
is
that
this
happened
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
this
happened
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
we
had
the
remmer
case.
the
remmer
case
was
10
days
old
when
this
happened.
when
we
were
in
judge
--
or
two
weeks
old
when
we
were
in
judge
mclaughlin's
chambers
and
we
had
the
remmer
case,
we
had
the
split
opinion.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
well,
i
didn't
know
what
you
had
in
mind.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
oh,
yes,
oh,
certainly.
the
court
of
appeals
wrote
no
--
no
opinion
except
judge
bazelon's
opinion
for
acquittal.
now
--
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
well,
the
trial
court
felt
that
they're
here
because
it
granted
a
hearing.
the
problem
was
solved
because
all
of
the
12
jurors
were
called
in
and
interrogated
and
they
said
they
were
not
defective
that
--
except
their
subjective
reaction.
and
in
the
mattox
case,
this
court
said
that
the
subjective
reaction
of
the
jurors
to
this
kind
of
interference
is
not
even
admissible,
it's
not
relevant.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
interference
could
have
frighten
them
and
it
did.
i
have
time
just
very
briefly
to
--
to
say
on
the
membership
instruction,
the
court
did
not
instruct
the
jury
as
to
what
are
the
components
or
the
definition
of
membership.
on
support,
the
court
refused
to
instruct
that
the
defendant's
knowledge
of
the
unlawful
objectives
of
the
communist
party
was
necessary
to
a
conviction.
and
it
defines
support
in
terms
of
a
dictionary
definition
which
included
--
simply
read
a
dictionary
definition
which
included
such
phrases
as
support
means
taking
the
side
of
or
defending
his
valid
and
right
or
support
the
claim
which
was
dragging
that
lose
definition
of
support.
there
was
no
evidence
in
this
case,
this
--
this
petitioner
should
never
been
indicted.
he
was
indicted
in
the
district
of
columbia
before
a
grand
jury
dominated
by
government
employees.
after
two
grand
juries
in
new
york,
to
whom
the
question
of
his
affidavit
have
been
presented,
had
refused
or
had
failed
to
return
an
indictment.
the
--
the
conviction
rest
entirely
on
the
testimony
of
the
--
on
the
opinion
of
the
paid
ex-communist
witnesses
of
the
department
of
justice.
no
one
came
to
say
that
he
had
seen
or
heard
the
defendant
that
any
leading
or
--
or
pay
any
dues
or
do
in
the
act
of
membership.
this
conviction
rest
entirely
on
opinion
and
while
a
conviction
resting
on
opinions
of
these
magicians
who
were
presented
by
the
department
might
be
valid
in
the
days
of
(inaudible),
i
don't
think
it
justifies
or
can
support
or
meets
our
concepts
of
--
of
inadequate
predicate
for
a
conviction
in
this
day
and
age.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
justice
burton,
the
jurors
were
interrogated
about
that
and
the
jurors
were
questioned
about
that.
mr.
harold
i.
cammer
bryson.
the
--
the
agent's
name
was
bryson
--
the
agent's
name
was
smazel
and
he
was
inquiring
about
bryson.
smazel
says
that
was
asking
about
bryson.
the
jurors
say
that
he
was
asking
about
gold
because
there
is
that
--
well,
at
least
they
understood
him
to
be
asking
about
gold
or
they
thought
he
was
asking
about
gold.
