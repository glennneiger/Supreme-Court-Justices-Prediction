mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
since
the
petitioner
has
closed
his
argument
on
the
question
concerning
the
fbi
contact
of
the
jurors,
i
should
like
as
a
first
point
to
continue
the
argument
on
that
point.
now,
to
set
the
--
to
set
the
incident
in
its
factual
background,
here
is
what
happened
and
the
record
bears
this
out,
i
submit
to
the
court.
the
gold
trial
had
been
in
progress
some
four
weeks.
on
march
the
5th,
according
to
evidence
adduced
during
a
hearing,
attended
by
petitioners
counsel
in
the
trial
court,
an
all
the
day
hearing
incidentally
before
judge
mclaughlin,
it
became
apparent
that
the
united
states
attorney
for
the
district
of
columbia,
mr.
leo
a.
rover,
now
judge
rover,
had
been
informed
by
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation,
sometime
prior
to
march
the
5th
of
1954,
that
a
juror
who
had
been
sitting
on
a
prior
panel,
that
would
be
either
january
or
february
of
1954,
had
received
a
circular
in
the
mail
concerning
the
case
of
united
states
against
hugh
bryson
which
at
the
time
of
the
gold
trial
and
at
that
the
time
of
the
incident
concerning
which
petitioner
complains,
there
was
an
indictment
in
the
united
states
district
court
and
that
indictment
was
waiting
trial.
in
any
event,
it's
clear
that
the
woman
who
first
received
the
circular
which
was
a
pro-bryson
circular
and
which
is
in
the
record
in
the
transcript
before
this
court.
that
circular
said,
in
substance,
bryson
great
constitutional
issues
are
involved
in
the
trial
of
hugh
bryson
and
it
went
along
in
that
line.
the
woman
called
that
to
the
attention,
if
your
honors
please,
of
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation's
local
office
here
in
washington,
who
in
turn
called
it
to
the
attention
of
the
united
states
attorney
upon
consideration
as
the
united
states
attorney
testified
before
judge
mclaughlin
in
the
hearing
in
the
gold
case.
the
united
states
attorney
requested
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
to
make
an
investigation
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
a
systematic
attempt
to
circularly
--
circularized
and
circulate
jurors
in
the
district
of
columbia
with
this
pro
defendant
bryson
statement
with
an
indictment
pending
in
this
court
--
in
the
--
in
the
district
court.
now,
with
that
as
a
background,
if
your
honors
please,
and
that
letter
incidentally
was
written
on
march
the
5th,
1954,
that
is
the
letter
from
mr.
rover
to
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation's
local
office
requesting
the
investigation.
thereafter,
and
i
might
point
out
to
your
honors
there,
it's
obvious
that
the
united
states
attorney
was
not
asking
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
to
investigate
jurors
sitting
on
the
gold
case
to
where
--
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
it
was
a
letter,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
it
is
in
the
record,
sir.
it's
during
the
--
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
i
can,
your
honor.
if
your
honor
will
indulge
me
one
minute.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
it
appears,
if
the
court
of
pleases,
on
page
--
excuse
me
just
a
second.
it's
around
1587,
1588,
your
honors.
now,
it's
obvious
from
reading
mr.
rover's
letter
to
the
bureau
that
he
was
not
requesting
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
to
investigate
sitting
jurors
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
he
did
ask
that
an
investigation
be
conducted
to
see
whether
or
not,
in
--
in
substance,
there
was
and
had
been
an
attempt
to
obstruct
justice
in
an
indictment
in
a
case
that
was
pending
in
his
court
that
didn't
involve
gold
in
one
way,
shape,
or
form.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
the
fbi
agent
did
go
out
and
investigate.
and
during
the
course
of
his
investigation,
he
went
to
the
jury
commission's
office
and
he
there
obtained
a
list
of
the
january
and
february
panel
of
the
jurors
in
our
court,
that
is
the
united
states
district
court
for
district
of
columbia.
the
petit
panel
sits
for
one
month
from
the
first
tuesday
of
the
month
until
the
first
monday
of
the
following
month.
the
gold
case
started
on
february
the
23rd,
a
monday.
it
didn't
end
up
until
april,
if
the
court
please,
so
that
on
unbeknownst
to
the
agent
who
was
doing
the
investigation
when
he
called
juror
abram's
wife
and
when
he
called
juror
morton
on
the
telephone
and
when
he
went
to
see
juror
(inaudible)
wife,
the
agent
did
not
know
that
they
were
active
jurors
in
the
gold
case.
the
reason
being
that
the
february
panel
had
completed
its
work
on
the
first
monday
of
march
and
except
for
the
--
the
gold
jurors
who
were
still
sitting
in
march
on
the
gold
case
which
it
carried
over
due
to
the
volume
of
evidence.
and
it's
clear
from
the
record
that
that
incident,
namely,
the
fact
that
the
agent
did
unknowingly
contact
the
jurors
in
question,
three.
one
of
them
on
the
phone,
the
wives
of
two
of
the
others,
and
--
and
mr.
abrams,
whose
wife
had
been
contacted,
later
came
in
person
the
next
day.
it's
clear
that
the
agent
was
called
before
judge
mclaughlin
and
that
the
agent
told
the
judge
and
was
cross-examination
if
--
cross-examined,
if
the
court
please,
by
defense
counsel
in
the
judge's
chambers
as
to
the
nature
of
the
content.
and
the
agent
said,
i
told
them
that
i
was
inquiring
whether
they
had
received
literature
in
the
bryson
case.
i
didn't
say
anything
about
gold.
if
that
is
apparent
from
the
hearing
before
judge
mclaughlin
which
took
all
day
long
from
early
morning,
and
that
is
i
should
say
from
10
o'clock
until
my
recollection
is
about
4:30
in
the
afternoon
with
time
out
for
lunch,
it's
apparent
that
the
--
that
the
affair
was
called
to
the
attention
of
the
government
by
the
fbi
when
abrams,
the
juror
--
one
of
the
juror's
wife
had
been
contacted,
came
to
the
fbi
office
the
next
day.
and
as
soon
as
he
came
down,
he
talked
with
another
agent
who
was
one
of
the
receiving
agents
there
and
he
said,
“someone
called
up
my
house
last
night
and
asked
my
wife
some
questions
as
to
whether
i
received
communist
literature.”
the
agent
said
--
and
then
mr.
abrams
said,
“i'm
sitting
on
the
gold
case”.
the
agent
who
he
talked
to
and
this
is
all
in
the
record,
if
your
honors
please.
the
agent
to
whom
he
talked
said,
“did
he
mention
the
gold
case?”
and
abram
says,
“no.”
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
that
is
correct,
sir.
when
mr.
abram's
came
down
the
morning
of
the
day
after
his
wife
had
been
called
by
agent
smazel,
he
talked
with
a
second
agent
at
the
washington
field
office.
and
he
came
down
there
(inaudible)
burden
of
the
testimony
in
that
point
which
is
in
the
record
is
that
at
first
he
wasn't
going
to
do
anything
about
it,
he
thought
it
was
joke
or
an
impersonator,
but
he
came
down.
when
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
learned
through
abrams
that
there
had
been
this
contact
of
abrams
by
agent
smazel,
agent
smazel
went
to
see
abrams
at
his
place
of
employment
in
the
washington
post,
saturday
morning,
march
the
20th,
1954.
and
agent
smazel
told
abrams,
“i'm
interested
only
in
the
hugh
bryson
advertisement.
here
it
is.
i
didn't
know
you
were
sitting
on
the
gold
case,
i'm
not
investigating
you.”
thereafter,
on
that
saturday,
it
was
immediately
called
to
the
attention
of
the
united
states
attorney's
office,
i
myself
happened
to
be
in
new
york
on
the
gold
case.
the
united
states
attorney
immediately
went
into
action,
this
was
a
saturday,
if
your
honors
will
recall
as
i
stated
and
the
record
so
shows.
the
united
states
attorney
immediately
went
into
action.
when
i
came
home
that
evening,
i
was
surprised
of
the
matter
for
the
first
time.
i
thereupon
held
a
conference
as
the
record
will
indicate
because
i
made
my
statement
during
the
course
of
the
hearing
before
judge
mclaughlin
all
day.
i
held
a
conference
in
the
department
of
justice
and
called
the
fbi
agent
there
and
several
of
the
attorneys
in
the
department.
i
have
the
list
of
the
jurors
sitting
in
the
gold
case.
i
make
it
a
business
to
keep
those
jurors
in
my
mind
when
i
can.
so
the
thought
occurred
to
me
when
the
agent
explained
to
me
that
he
didn't
know
that
there
were
any
february
jurors
still
on
there,
that
he
might
have
not
only
contacted
the
wife
of
abrams
but
that
he
might
have
contacted
someone
else.
so
i
said,
all
right,
i'll
name
--
i'll
read
these
names,
if
you
contacted
anyone
else,
i
want
to
know
about
it.
and
on
reading
the
names,
i
found
that
the
agent
unknowingly,
obviously,
that
he
was
contacting
anyone
sitting
in
the
gold
case,
had
contacted
on
the
phone
juror
morton
and
had
contacted
the
wife
of
juror
(inaudible),
gone
over
there
--
he'd
gone
over
in
the
morning
of
friday,
the
19th
day
of
march
and
talked
to
juror
(inaudible)
wife.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
abrams'
wife
was
talked
to
--
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
my
recollection
and
i'm
sure
i
might
on
this
--
is
march
the
20th
in
the
morning.and
thereafter
--
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
as
soon
as
the
situation
--
as
soon
as
i
discovered
that
there
were
two
others
who
talked
to
either
on
the
phone
or
the
wife
of
(inaudible)
was
talked
to,
i
conferred
with
the
united
states
attorney
at
his
home,
that
sunday
afternoon.
and
it
was
clear
that
it
was
incumbent
upon
the
government
in
the
light
of
the
first
remmer
decision
which
came
down
on
march
the
8th,
about
two
weeks
before
this
incident
happened,
and
even
if
the
first
remmer
decision
hadn't
come
down,
obviously,
it
was
incumbent
upon
the
government
that
this
was
a
matter
to
be
called
to
the
trial
judge's
attention
in
(inaudible).
well,
it
was
done
the
best
we
could
do
it.
that
was
a
sunday.
judge
rover
called
judge
mclaughlin
and
said
there
was
a
matter
that
he
wanted
to
talk
--
take
up
with
him
in
chambers.
i
personally,
when
i
returned
to
my
home,
called
defense
counsel
and
told
them
that
there
was
a
matter
to
be
taken
up.
i
didn't
tell
them
what
it
was.
in
the
morning
of
monday,
march
the
22nd,
we
repaired.
and
when
i
say
we,
i
mean
myself,
judge
mclaughlin,
all
counsel
for
defendant
gold
and
no
question
was
ever
raised
in
any
time
about
defendant
gold
himself
not
being
at
the
hearing,
repair
to
the
judge's
chamber.
there
was
no
request
that
this
be
held
in
open
court
and
from
10
o'clock
in
the
morning
until
about
4:30
in
the
afternoon,
if
my
recollection
serves
me
correctly
and
the
volume
of
the
records
will
bear
me
out
in
volumes
4
and
5,
judge
mclaughlin
heard
from
mr.
leo
rover,
judge
rover,
the
united
states
attorney
who
gave
his
statement
as
to
how
the
matter
had
been
brought
to
him.
a
mr.
(inaudible),
who
was
an
attorney
working
on
the
bryson
case,
agent
smazel,
who
was
the
agent
who
made
the
contact,
agent
smazel
who
was
the
agent
on
that
saturday
morning
of
march
the
20th
to
whom
abrams
came
in
person
down
at
the
--
at
the
local
fbi
office.
up
to
that
point,
there
was
ample
opportunity
and
the
defense
wasn't
asked
to
post
questions,
asked
to
cross-examine
and
they
did.at
that
point,
judge
mclaughlin
with
the
first
remmer
decision
before
him
and
that's
adverted
to
in
the
record,
said,
“i
do
not
find
from
these
facts
as
adduced
here
that
this
was
a
contact
with
a
juror
about
a
matter
pending
before
the
jury,
nor
was
it
an
investigation
of
the
conduct
of
the
juror.”
now,
understand
me
why,
your
honors,
that
is
before
any
jurors
are
called
in.
at
that
point
or
shortly
thereafter,
judge
mclaughlin
on
the
suggestion
of
government
counsel
and
the
record
will
bear
me
out
with
full
concurrence
of
the
petitioner
gold's
counsel
to
this
extent
said
that
he
would
call
in
the
three
jurors
(inaudible),
morton
and
abrams.
petitioner's
counsel
wanted
him
to
call
him
in
and
question
him,
but
they
didn't
want
the
trial
judge
to
ask
the
jurors
what
their
reactions
to
the
contact
was.
judge
mclaughlin
said
that
he
was
going
to
ask
them
respect
--
concerning
their
reactions
to
the
contact
and
it's
submitted,
if
your
honors
please,
that
he
was
duty-bound
so
to
do
because
the
first
remmer
decision
verbatim
--
the
whole
reason
for
the
remand
in
the
first
remmer
decision
as
i
read
it
is
because
the
trial
court
without
telling
the
defendant,
without
letting
anyone
else
to
know,
and
without
even
having
a
hearing
brushed
the
matter
aside.
and
this
court
sent
the
case
back
in
order
that
the
trial
court
might
inquire
into
the
impact
of
any
contact
on
the
juror's
mind.and
that's
what
judge
mclaughlin
did.
and
he
called
in
abrams
and
he
called
in
(inaudible)
and
he
called
in
morton.
abrams,
during
the
course
of
interrogation
and
defense
counsel
were
asked
if
they
wanted
to
ask
questions,
were
asked
if
they
would
post
questions.
abrams
said
when
asked
how
he
felt
on
exhaustive
probing
by
judge
mclaughlin,
who
was
a
learned
judge.
abrams
said,
"you
ask
me
how
i
feel?
i
--
i
feel
--
i
think
i
feel
somewhat
intimidated."
the
judge
made
it
clear
as
soon
as
abrams
had
stepped
out,
abrams
will
be
excused
from
this
jury.
(inaudible)
and
morton,
morton
who
was
contacted
on
the
phone
made
it
clear
and
the
transcript
will
bear
me
out
that
the
agent,
when
he
talked
with
morton
on
the
phone,
was
not
and
did
not
refer
to
the
gold
case
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form.
when
asked
as
to
if
anything
had
happened
--
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
you
mean
in
haec
verba
your
honor?
i
mean
in
--
in
--
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
i
think
that
morton
testified
--
if
your
honor
indulge
me
one
second
so
that
i
may
be
accurate
on
this.
morton,
your
honor,
testified
that
his
--
testified
that
smazel
said
this,
smazel,
your
honor,
had
said
that
he
called
and
inquired
whether
morton
had
received
literature
pertaining
to
the
hugh
bryson
case.
morton
said
that
he
got
the
telephone
call
in
thursday
evening
and
that
smazel
said,
"i
knew
you
were
on
the
jury
panel
for
last
month."
someone
tried
to
get
next
to
the
jurors
by
sending
propaganda
literature
to
their
house
--
homes.
he
called,
meaning
smazel,
called
the
name
of
a
case
i
didn't
understand
which
obviously
couldn't
have
been
the
gold
case.
at
least
i'd
heard
nothing
about
it.
and
he
asked
if
i'd
received
anything,
and
i
said
no,
and
i
told
him
i
was
still
on
the
jury.
smazel
said
he
has
no
clear
recollection
that
morton
ever
told
him
that
on
that
evening.
now
--
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
juror's
understanding
of
what
was
told
him
even
though
he
might
be
wrong
is
what
you
have
to
take.
and
i'm
perfectly
--
i
think
it
would
be
an
untenable
position
to
say
otherwise,
but
i
further
submit,
if
the
court
pleases,
that
the
first
remmer
decision
made
it
incumbent
upon
judge
mclaughlin
to
do
just
exactly
what
he
did,
namely,
to
inquire
into
the
impact
of
the
contact
upon
the
juror's
partiality.
and
when
juror
morton,
the
one
whom
mr.
chief
justice
just
questioned
me
about,
was
asked
by
judge
mclaughlin,
not
only
asked
but
probed
and
probed
extensively
as
to
what
his
reactions
were,
he
said,
wouldn't
affect
me
one
way
or
the
other.
(inaudible),
the
other
juror
who
remained
on
the
jury,
your
honors,
was
asked
the
same
question,
not
asked
at
once,
he
was
asked
in
the
negative
and
the
positive
and
with
all
one
who
answers,
and
he
answered
the
same
way.
now,
it
became
--
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
your
honor
--
i
beg
your
honors'
indulgence.
that
is
not
the
--
the
sequence
as
the
bureau
agent
testified.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
no,
your
honor.
morton
was
on
thursday
evening
--
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
--
but
the
agent
said
that
he
had
absolutely
no
recollection
of
morton
telling
him,
as
morton
says
he
did,
that
he
was
then
on
the
gold
case.
in
other
words,
the
first
word
that
the
agent
had
was
when
abrams
came
down
to
the
bureau
office,
the
--
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
office
the
morning
of
the
saturday
following
the
night
that
the
agent
had
called
abrams'
wife.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
it
is,
your
honor.
it
appears
at
the
--
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
no,
your
honor.
the
reason
for
that
was
that
i
like
to
try
to
extract
them.
i
can
read
my
own
handwriting
a
little
bit
better
than
print
sometime,
makes
a
little
more
sense
to
me
anyhow.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
he
did,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
that
is
what
morton
testified,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
that
is
right.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
no,
it
was
the
next
day
that
agent
smazel
went
to
see
(inaudible)
wife,
your
honor.
but
may
i
make
it
clear
to
your
honor,
that
the
agent
made
it
clear
abundantly
that
he
had
absolutely
no
recollection
of
having
been
told
by
morton
on
the
telephone
conversation
that
morton
was
a
sitting
juror.
morton
says
he
did,
the
agent
says
that
he
has
no
recollection
that
he
did.
in
other
words,
the
point
that
i
make
to
your
honors
is
that
the
agent
was
not
contacting
(inaudible)
and
abrams
after
he
had
heard
from
morton,
at
least
in
his
own
time
because
he
says
he
doesn't
recall
that.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
well
--
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
i
think
that
that
is
the
question
without
a
doubt,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
well,
with
all
due
deference
to
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it's
beside
the
point
because
--
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
with
that
in
mind,
if
i
may
take
one
more
moment
of
the
court's
time,
and
the
reason
that
i
took
this
much
time
on
the
factual
situation
was
because
i
didn't
think
that
the
factual
situation
with
all
due
deference
to
my
opposition
was
adequately
brought
to
the
court's
attention.
one
more
bit
on
the
facts,
after
it
became
apparent
that
there
had
been
some
conversation
between
morton
and
(inaudible)
with
some
of
the
other
jurors
again
on
government's
motion,
the
court
brought
everyone
of
the
11
remaining
jurors
on
alternate
end
and
inquired
of
them
exhaustedly
as
to
what
they
--
as
to
whether
they
had
any
reason
that
they
couldn't
be
fair
and
impartial.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
yes,
your
honor
--
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
the
evidence,
your
honor,
is
this
that
they
all
--
five
of
them
said
that
they've
heard
something.
they
didn't
say
what
they'd
heard.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
it's
nearly
as
vague
as
that,
your
honor.
that
they'd
--
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
from
the
answers
of
the
subsequent
jurors,
i
think
that
it
could
be
inferred
that
--
that
morton
and
(inaudible)
had
told
them
that,
but
there's
--
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
i
beg
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
morton
and
--
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
your
honor,
i'm
not
in
disagreement
with
that
but
justice
--
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
--
justice
frankfurter's
question
was,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
reflects
what
the
other
juror
said
had
been
told
them
by
morton
and
(inaudible).
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
at
best
it's
vague,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
i'm
not
sure
that
i
get
the
full
burden
of
your
honors'
question.
if
you'll
indulge
me
--
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
yes.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
well,
may
i
answer
your
--
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
first
of
all,
may
i
say
with
all
due
deference
to
the
court
that
of
course
the
fbi
wouldn't
never
be
sent
to
make
such
an
investigation
--
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
i
realized
that,
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
well,
the
posture
which
is
in
the
hypothetical
case.
i
think
that
if
it
could
be
shown
that
the
government,
meaning
--
say
the
united
states
attorney,
undertook
to
send
the
fbi
to
investigate
the
conduct
of
a
sitting
juror
and
for
that
purpose
alone,
which
never
would
happen
i'm
sure,
it
would
call
for
a
new
trial
but
--
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
i
would
say
that
that
case
is
not
the
same
as
this,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
i'm
sorry.
i
--
i
mean
to
say
the
answer
that
i
--
as
i
see
it
to
your
honor's
question
is
this,
i
can't
envision,
number
one,
the
situation
never
arising.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
very
well,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
amplify
briefly
upon
my
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
at
the
close
of
yesterday's
hearing.
the
chief
justice
asked
--
assume
that
in
a
--
an
instance,
in
a
hypothetical
instance,
it
was
shown
that
intentionally
and
knowingly,
a
representative
of
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
was
sent
to
investigate
sitting
jurors
but
that
--
and
that,
rather,
on
a
hearing
conducted
after
the
fact
had
become
known,
the
reaction
of
those
jurors
as
inquired
into
by
the
trial
court
was
the
same
as
the
reaction
of
the
jurors
in
the
case
before
the
court,
the
gold
case.
and
my
--
and
the
chief
justice's
inquiry
was,
"would
that
necessitate
a
mistrial
or
a
new
trial
if
the
mistrial
had
been
denied?"
and
my
answer
was,
it
would
have.
as
i
view
it,
the
question
then
evolves,
why
would
it,
in
that
instance,
if
the
reaction
of
the
jurors
weren't
the
same?
and
my
answer
to
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
members
of
the
court,
is
this.
that
if
it
were
shown
in
a
hypothetical
instance
that
the
government
itself
was
guilty
of
misconduct
which
it
undoubtedly
would
have
been
where
it
to
send
the
fbi
to
investigate
jurors,
that
incident
in
and
of
itself,
apart
from
the
reaction
of
the
jurors,
whether
they
were
the
same
as
in
the
gold
case,
would
be
sufficient
to
use
a
phrase
to
shock
the
conscience
of
the
trial
court
and
call
for
a
mistrial,
not
because
the
reaction
of
the
jurors
in
the
hypothetical
and
in
the
present
case
were
the
same
but
because
the
government
was
guilty
of
misconduct.
and
i
believe,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
that
is
the
distinguishing
feature
of
the
case.
now,
briefly,
may
i
advert
very
briefly
to
one
of
two
other
points
with
respect
to
the
situation
that
was
before
the
court
yesterday
during
the
government's
argument.
it
is
clear
in
the
first
place
that
the
calling
of
the
remaining
11
jurors
including
the
two
arguments
by
judge
mclaughlin
singly
for
interrogation
by
him
was
done
with
full
consent
of
the
petitioner,
defendant
in
the
court
below,
appearing
at
page
1646
of
the
transcript
of
the
record.
the
thing
that
the
petitioner
in
the
court
below
did
not
want
the
trial
judge
to
inquire
into
when
he
called
the
remaining
11
jurors
in
was,
they
are
subjective
reaction
to
the
--
the
contact,
if
they
had
heard
of
it.
but
under
the
remmer
decision,
the
court
was
bound
to
do
so
because
the
first
remmer
case
said,
"he
must
inquire
into
the
impact
of
the
jurors."
and
judge
mclaughlin
did
that.
there
is
another
point
that
i
should
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention.
the
reason
that
the
jurors
who
were
interrogated
by
the
trial
court
exhaustively
and
fully
and
fairly
were
not
told
that
the
contact
was
not
the
result
of
anything
on
the
part
of
the
defendant,
gold,
or
on
the
part
of
government
counsel
in
the
gold
case
was
because
when
the
government
counsel
suggested
that
that
be
done,
there
was
an
objection
on
the
defendant's
part.
and
that
objection
appears,
if
your
honors
please,
on
pages
1625,
1627
of
the
record
as
i
read
it.
if
your
honors
please,
the
last
point
is
that
the
remmer
case,
as
both
of
them
say
that
in
a
situation
where
there
has
been
a
communication
with
that
sitting
trial
juror,
there
arises
not
an
absolute
presumption,
but
a
rebuttable
presumption
that
the
burden
rests
upon
the
government
and
rests
heavily
upon
the
government
to
rebut
the
presumption.
this
situation
before
your
honors
is
not
the
remmer
case
at
all.
the
vice
of
the
remmer
case,
as
i
view
it,
was
that
the
trial
judge,
after
the
contact
was
brought
to
his
attention,
didn't
tell
the
defendant
a
thing
about
it,
an
ex
parte
almost
in
secret,
investigated
the
matter.
and
the
first
time
that
defendant
knew
anything
about
it
was
after
the
remmer
trial.
there
was
no
hearing
immediately.
here,
there
was.
there
was
a
full
hearing,
an
exhaustive
hearing
conducted
by
the
trial
judge
in
which
all
parties
were
called
before
the
court
and
there
was
full
opportunity
for
the
defendant
to
ask
questions
if
he
wanted
to
or
to
pose
questions
to
be
asked
if
he
wanted
to
and
it
--
and
they
did
that,
if
the
court
please.
i
respectfully
suggest
--
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
determinable,
your
honor,
the
episode
was
--
the
hearing
was
on
march
the
22nd,
a
monday,
1954.
and
it's
my
recollection,
your
honor,
and
i
may
be
in
error
on
this
that
the
government's
last
witness
was
on
the
stand
booth
hence
--
and
the
case
went
to
the
jury
maybe
a
week
afterwards,
somewhere
in
there.
i'm
not
positive
on
that,
your
honor.
there
was
a
--
there
was
a
lag
of
more
than
two
or
three
days
of
that
i
am
positive.
i
think
it
was
more
of
a
week.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
he
asked
the
first
three
jurors
abrams,
morton
and
dee
dee,
your
honor,
that
specific
question.
when
it
became
apparent
that
there
had
been
mentioned
by
them
in
some
form
or
another
through
some
of
the
remaining
11
jurors
when
the
trial
judge
called
the
remaining
11
in,
he
did
not
ask
them
if
they
had
contact
but
--
if
they
had
been
contacted
because
it
was
clearly
established
at
that
time
that
the
only
three
who
had
been
contacted
directly
or
indirectly
were
abrams,
morton
and
dee
dee.
what
the
trial
justice
did
was
when
he
called
--
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
very
well,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
very
well,
your
honor.
in
closing
on
the
point,
if
it
please
the
court,
the
presumption
was
rebutted
in
this
case.
there
was
a
full
and
there
was
a
fair
hearing
by
a
learned
trial
judge
who
excused
two
jurors,
the
latter
of
--
the
second
of
whom
had
said
he
never
heard
anything
about
the
incident
(inaudible),
who
exercises
discretion
to
the
utmost
and
who
was
in
the
position
to
view
the
jurors,
view
the
witnesses
and
in
the
best
position.
may
i
suggest
to
the
court
in
the
exercise
of
his
discretion
to
determine
whether
the
trial
should
and
could
go
forward.
judge
mclaughlin,
in
the
court
below
after
the
hearing,
said
that
the
trial
should
go
forward
and
it's
the
government's
position
that
he
did
that
in
the
exercise
of
the
discretion
given
to
him
and
that
that
discretion
should
be
upheld
in
this
court.
this
is
not
the
remmer
case.
there
was
no
evidence
that
any
of
the
jurors
were
under
terrific
pressure
as
the
jury
foreman
in
remmer
testified.
now,
with
respect
to
the
two
witness
perjury
rule
so
called,
it
is
true
that
the
trial
court
refused
to
instruct
the
jury
on
the
perjury
rule,
namely,
that
you
must
find
the
falsity
supported,
rather
contradicted
by
the
--
testimony
of
two
witnesses
or
by
one
plus
corroborative
circumstances.
the
government
says
that
the
court
was
amply
justified
in
refusing
that
instruction.
for
these
reasons,
section
9
(h)
of
the
--
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
of
1947,
which
is
the
noncommunist
affidavit
provision
states,
at
the
very
end,
that
in
respect
to
such
affidavits,
the
provisions
of
section
1001
of
title
18,
united
states
code,
shall
be
applicable.
that
language
was
written
by
congress
in
1947,
a
little
more
than
two
years
after
this
court
had
handed
down
its
decision
in
wyler
in
which
it
reversed
the
trial
court
and
said
that
in
a
perjury
case,
the
instruction
must
be
given.
but
i
submit
that
this
court
also
mentioned
in
the
wyler
case,
"we
have
seen
no
legislation
in
derogation
of
the
perjury
rule
even
if
it
be
archaic."
two
years
later,
with
the
invitation
of
this
court
in
the
language
of
wyler,
congress
in
passing
section
9
(h)
of
the
taft
--
of
the
taft-hartley
act,
specifically
said
1001
shall
be
applicable
to
the
taft-hartley
affidavits.
i
--
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
it
is,
your
honor,
under
the
statutes
involved,
certainly.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
you
mean
the
--
you
mean,
your
honor,
the
wording
of
section
1001
itself?
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
insofar
as
its
wording
is
concerned,
it
has
nothing
to
say
about
the
perjury
rule.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
for
this
reason,
if
the
court
please.
there
never
has
been
found
to
the
government's
counsel's
knowledge,
an
appellate
decision
in
which
involving
a
1001
case
in
which
the
perjury
rule
has
been
held
applicable
and
the
one
case
which
directly
had
the
question
before
it
in
the
appellate
court
todorow
against
the
united

rejected
the
proposition
that

instruction
had

argument
is
made
that
--
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
there
are,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
not
so
far
as
the
government
is
able
to
ascertain,
your
honor.
in
one
case
cited
in
the
government's
brief,
lange,
l-a-n-g-e,
against
the
united
states,
it's
my
recollection
that
judge
--
district
court
judge
--
sorry,
your
honor.
i
believe
the
lange
case
is
cited
in
the
petitioner's
brief.
district
court
judge
weinfeld
in
his
opinion,
as
i
read
it,
implicitly
say
that
where
congress
wants
to
make
the
provisions
of
the
perjury
statute,
18
united
states
code
1621
applicable,
they
can
say
so
and
they
did.
here,
they
said
1001
with
the
past
history
that
the
two-witness
perjury
rule
has
never
been
applied
in
1001
cases,
and
it
seems
to
the
government
that
that's
a
clear
mandate
on
congress'
part
that
it
will
not
burden
the
government
in
1001
prosecutions
under
the
taft-hartley
act
with
the
prescriptions
or
the
added
burden
of
the
two-witness
perjury
rule.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
in
an
--
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
if
your
honor
please,
at
the
time
that
the
taft-hartley
act
was
passed
in
1947,
the
penalty
under
1001
was
10
years
as
far
as
prison
term
was
concerned.
it
later
was
reduced
to
make
it
equal
with
the
perjury
statute,
five
years
of
each.
now,
the
argument
has
been
ceased
upon
by
petitioner
that
it's
incongruous
to
have
a
congress
naming
a
statute
1001
with
a
greater
penalty
than
the
perjury
statute
had.
the
government's
answer
is
that
it
isn't
incongruous,
if
the
court
please,
it's
equally
justifiable
by
way
of
reason
that
congress
intended
to
protect
interstate
commerce
from
political
strikes
which
was
the
basis
of
the
taft-hartley
act
by
imposing
a
greater
penalty
at
the
time.
i
think
that
the
penalty
provision
is
not
indicative
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
two-witness
perjury
rule
should
have
been
--
should
be
applied.
and
the
--
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
and
that
was
the
burden
of
my
last
remark,
your
honor,
that
it
well
could
be
that
congress
didn't
want
the
higher
penalty
imposed
at
the
time
it
passed
the
act
without
burdening
the
government
with
the
--
with
the
prescriptions
of
the
perjury
rule.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
well
--
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
i
think
that
the
--
on
my
personal
--
i
mean,
the
government's
position,
i
would
put
it
is
that
there
is
very
little
justification
for
it
in
reason.
our
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
has
said
that
the
true
perjury
rule
is
this.
that
it
is
not
that
you
have
to
have
two
witnesses
or
one
plus
corroboration
but
that
the
rule
is
that
you
cannot
prove
perjury
on
the
unsupported
testimony
of
one
witness.
and
our
court
goes
further
just
to
say
in
the
(inaudible)
case
and
in
an
oregon
case
that
in
peculiar
circumstances,
perjury
may
be
proved
by
circumstantial
evidence
alone.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
where
in
a
murder
case
or
a
rape
case
or
other
crimes
of
--
of
violence
in
--
in
the
serious
nature,
you
can
have
the
--
you
can
have
a
conviction
on
a
testimony
of
one
witness.
it
does
not,
with
all
due
respects,
appeal
to
logic
to
say
that
in
perjury,
you
have
to
have
two
or
one
plus
corroboration
that
circumstantial
is
not
sufficient.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
well,
if
your
honor
--
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
well,
if,
your
honor,
please.
i
believe
that
the
reasoning
in
the
wyler
case
says
that
in
substance,
that
the
rule
has
persisted
its
time
on
it
and
until
changed
by
a
legislation,
it's
there
and
there
it
is.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
i
am
saying
as
one
reason,
yes,
your
honor,
that
congress
in
plain
language,
in
the
very
writing
of
section
9
(h)
of
the
taft-hartley
act
said,
1001
shall
be
applicable.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
well,
if
your
honor
please,
1001
requires
a
--
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
it
does
not
with
respect
to
the
so
called
perjury
rule.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
no,
your
honor.
if
the
court
pleases,
i
should
like
to
pass
to
the
question
of
the
--
raised
by
the
petitioner
that
this
case
was
tried
in
the
court
below
on
an
unconstitutional
interpretation
of
the
douds
case.
in
other
words,
that
the
government
tried
this
case
on
the
theory
that
a
communist
could
not
resign
from
the
party
and
therefore,
we
violated
the
principle
enunciated
by
this
court,
through
mr.
chief
justice
benson
when
he
said
that
the
reason
that
the
act
was
not
a
bill
of
attainder
was
because
there
was
no
one
who,
by
a
voluntary
change
in
his
loyalties,
could
not
truthfully
sign
the
affidavit.
if
your
honors
please,
this
case
was
not
tried
on
the
first
count,
the
membership
count,
on
any
theory
that
gold
could
not
resign.
this
case
was
tried
on
the
theory
that
gold
in
fact
did
not
resign,
that
his
resignation
was
a
fraud
and
a
sham
and
done
only
in
order
to
give
him
a
paper
at
least
that
he
could
use
to
sign
the
non-communist
affidavit.
in
other
words
--
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
your
honor,
the
--
in
point
of
time,
the
closest
testimony
to
the
actual
date
of
signing,
filing
august
30,
was
testimony
with
respect
to
the
meaning
of
gold's
so
called
resignation
statement
which
appeared
publicly
which
was
issued
on
august
the
27th,
about
two
days
before
he
actually
signed
and
three
days
before
his
affidavit
was
received
by
the
board.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
that
testimony,
your
honor,
was
this.
that
in
the
resignation
statement
where
the
petitioner,
gold,
among
other
things
said,
“neither
i
nor
the
communist
party
have
ever
advocated
the
overthrow
of
a
democratically
elected
government,”
and
where
he
said,
“i
have
resigned
from
the
party,
but
i
do
not
give
up
my
belief
in
true
democracy.”
that
those
phrases
contained
in
the
language
of
the
communist
party,
aesopian
language,
which
merely
means
double
thought.
and
that
in
the
expert's
opinion,
the
phrase,
“democratically
elected
government
and
true
democracy”
mean
one
thing
and
one
thing
only
to
wit
the
union
of
soviet
socialist
republics
and
that
the
united
states
is
not
a
democratically
elected
government.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
the
government
witnesses
gitlow,
lautner,
johnson.
i
believe
those
are
the
three,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
lautner
was
expelled
from
the
party
in
1950
--
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
january.
no,
it
was
about
three
months
or
four
months
before.
january
1950,
your
honor.
i
should
add,
there
was
another
witness,
(inaudible),
who
was
in
the
party
as
late
as
1953
when
he
testified
in
seattle,
who
also,
to
my
recollection,
testified
concerning
the
"aesopianism".
i
should
further
say
that
it
is
clear
from
the
testimony
that
gold,
when
he
attended
the
lenin
institute
in
moscow,
russia
in
1930
and
1931,
where
he
was
taught
among
other
things
class
warfare.
he
was
also
taught
the
use
of
aesopian
language.
that
was
testified
too
by
the
witness
(inaudible).
and
that
it
further
appeared
from
the
record
that
in
1935,
gold
presided
at
a
communist
party
meeting
wherein
the
question
of
communist
getting
back
into
the
afl
arose
and
that
it
was
told
to
gold
and
told
to
those
present
that
they
should
use
every
artifice
and
every
device
even
the
denial
of
membership
to
get
back
into
the
afl.
and
further,
in
1948,
gold
attended
a
communist
party
meeting
in
which
the
top
echelon
of
the
party
presided
in
new
york,
in
which
the
whole
question
was
what
to
do
about
the
taft-hartley
affidavits.
and
it's
clear
from
a
testimony
of
the
witness
akert,
if
the
court
please
on
that
point
that
the
discussion
there
again
was
the
use
of
false
resignation.
it's
clear
further
from
the
witness
lautner
that
one
of
the
devices
used
by
the
party
for
false
resignation
was
the
use
of
registered
letters
which
is
precisely
what
the
defendant
gold
did
when
he
wrote
the
secretary
general
of
the
community
party,
“dear
gust,
i
am
hereby
resigning.
fraternally
yours,
ben
gold.”
in
other
words,
if
the
court
please,
this
case
was
submitted
not
on
any
can't
resign
theory
on
count
number
one,
it
was
submitted
to
the
jury
and
he
didn't
resign,
his
resignation
was
false,
and
the
jury
was
entitled
to
infer
not
only
from
that
but
from
evidence
as
to
subsequent
actions
of
gold
when
he
attended
the
1951
and
1952
mayday
parades
which
the
evidence
showed
where
communist
control
and
was
on
the
stand
with
williamson,
dennis
and
the
rest
of
the
hierarchy
of
the
communist
party
and
spoke
there
and
was
at
the
parade
and
spoke
in
1952
that
if
he
had
made
a
bonafide
change
in
allegiance,
in
other
words,
that
severed
his
membership,
he
never
would
have
been
allowed
near
union
square
in
may
of
1951
and
1952.
i
might
further
say
to
the
court
--
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
that
is
true,
your
honor.
the
jury
was
instructed
on
that
point
that
gold
was
not
being
tied
for
his
beliefs.
it
was
not
illegal
for
him
to
have
been
a
member.
but
the
evidence
was
also
that
the
formal
indicia
of
membership
in
the
communist
party
to
wit
carrying
cards,
attending
meetings,
paying
dues,
is
not
the
only
time
of
that
membership
in
the
party.
it
was
testified
too
abundantly
and
testified
too
by
the
witness
akert
with
respect
to
signing
an
noncommunist
affidavit,
that
the
whole
plan
then
would
be
to
have
an
underground
connection
and
membership
with
the
party.
in
other
words,
that
the
formal
indicia
are
not
necessary
for
the
--
for
the
membership,
where
there
was
the
false
resignation.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
well,
if
the
court
please,
the
evidence
before
the
jury
was
that
membership
is
not
limited
to
those
who
carry
cards
and
so
on.
there
is
membership
in
the
party
by
those
who
have
connections
covertly,
whose
allegiance
to
the
party
is
there,
whose
objection
to
discipline
is
there.
and
that
is
what
we
submit,
was
justifiable
inference
--
inference
for
the
jury
in
the
gold
case
on
count
one.
i
might
further
say
that
since
the
concurrent
sentences
were
imposed,
that
there's
no
need
for
the
court
to
reach
count
three
if
in
fact
the
court
finds
that
count
one
is
valid
which
the
government
strongly
urges
it
is
and
we
don't
mean
to
say
that
count
three
isn't
either.
i
should,
in
closing,
say
that
i
have
not
reached
the
question
of
the
grand
and
petit
juries.
it's
covered
adequately
in
the
--
in
the
government's
brief.
one
final
word,
the
--
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
there
is
none
with
respect
to
the
petit
jurors.
there
was
ample
opportunity
for
showing
of
actual
bias.
the
dennis
case,
i
don't
think,
your
honor,
the
first
dennis
case,
the
contempt
case
did
not
reach
the
grand
jury
question.
the
government's
position
is
the
same
as
it
was
in
(inaudible).
final
word
with
--
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
five
government
employees
and
the
wife
of
a
washington
policeman.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
if
your
honor
please,
my
memory
does
not
serve
me
on
that.
the
petitioner
has
suggested
to
this
court
that
the
solicitor
general,
if
he
has
information
that
a
government
witness
johnson
perjured
himself
in
gold,
should
come
forward.
i
am
authorized
to
state
to
this
court
that
if
the
solicitor
general
had
information
in
his
possession
that
any
witness
in
the
gold
case
did
not
testify
truthfully
in
that
case,
the
solicitor
general
would
have
been
before
this
court.
this
is
not
the
(inaudible)
case,
nor
is
it
the
communist
party
case
where
the
motion
was
made
before
the
board
for
a
remand
on
grounds
of
newly-discovered
evidence.
the
petitioner
claims
that
johnson
perjured
himself
subsequent
to
trial
with
the
gold
case
in
another
matter.
he
has
had
over
two
years
since
that
--
that
notice
of
that
--
of
his
allegation
was
made
public
through
the
column
of
a
columnist
mr.
(inaudible).
he
has
made
not
one
move
in
the
trial
court
under
rule
33
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
and
at
(inaudible)
to
press
the
point
before
the
highest
court
in
the
land
which
is
not
the
form
for
passing
on
motions
for
a
new
trial.
in
closing
--
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
well
if,
your
honor,
please.
the
record
does
not
show
that.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
i
should
say
to
the
court
that
i'm
not
at
all
positive
in
my
own
mind.
in
fact,
i'm
probably
positive
the
other
way
that
the
new
york
investigation
was
not
--
was
an
investigatory
grand
jury.
if
your
honor
appreciates
what
i'm
saying,
i
--
i
can't
very
well
make
a
disclosure
as
to
what
happened
before
the
grand
jury,
but
i
can
say
unqualifiedly
that
my
understanding
is
that
it
was
an
investigatory
point
up
there
and
furthermore,
that
the
venue
for
the
affidavit
under
valenti
is
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
not
in
new
york,
if
the
court
please.
in
closing
--
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
no,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
my
recollection
does
not
serve
me,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
lowther
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
