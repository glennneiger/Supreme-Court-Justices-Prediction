you
don't
think
it
has
--
you
don't
think
it's
permissible
to
project
some
inference
into
the
future?
you
think
you
have
to
cut
it
off
at
that
point?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
is
that
a
complete
answer
to
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
know,
but
if
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
a
man
--
if
a
man
goes
through
a
purported
resignation
which
a
jury
finds
insufficient
evidence
is
--
can
apply,
isn't
it
a
permissible
inference
for
them
also
to
draw
the
--
the
reason
he
did
that
instead
of
out-making
a
resignation
is
to
cover
up
something
for
the
future?
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
he
take
the
witness
stand?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
understand
that
your
opponent
is
suggesting
at
all
that
this
was
deliberate
effort
to
influence
the
jury
by
the
government.
they
don't
make
that
charge,
do
they?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
the
case
isn't
a
case
in
this
posture
that
whatever
the
instructions
whether
they
were
given
to
the
jurors,
the
fbi
slapped
over
into
this
case.
didn't
do
a
good
job
if
you
please
or
what
not,
the
only
question
was
that
here
is
what
the
effect
of
all
this
was
on
the
hearing.

justice
john
m.
harlan
so
all
of
this
long
defense
of
the
government's
position
really
is
beside
the
point
here,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
can
appreciate
it
if
i
was
in
your
position,
i
want
to
make
it
clear
too.
but
actually
the
issue
we've
got
is
simply
whether
or
not
the
judge
dealt
with
the
situation
that
existed,
arose
without
the
government's
fault,
if
you
please,
adequate
(inaudible),
isn't
that
all
there
is
to
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
was
the
tangible
between
the
essential
and
the
sufficient
(inaudible)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
also
included
however

john

and
therefore,
it
proved

that's
something
that
has
been
attributed
to
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
didn't
mean
that.
(inaudible)
of
your
argument
is
that
since
these
lower
court
cases
do
not
apply
the

rule

therefore,

to

justice
john
m.

(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
the
--
could
i
ask
you
one
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
the
record
show
why
the
government,
after
failing
to
get
an
indictment
before
a
new
york
grand
jury
and
move
the
case
down
here?
