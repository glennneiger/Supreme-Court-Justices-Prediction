was
the
question
raised
by
any
request?
justice

(voice

denied?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you're
right
about
that
(inaudible)
if
you're
right
about
that,
namely,
perjury
rule
applies
(inaudible)
is
the
charge
or
the
requested
charge
which
was
denied
of
the
kind
which
we
dealt
with
in
whatever
the
case
was
sometime
ago.
justice
felix
frankfurter
weiler.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
case
is
the
--
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
this
point
can
be
dealt
with
in
a
very
simple
fashion
can
go
right
where
the
request
may
and
the
request
denied
which
brings
you
within
the
weiler
case,
what's
the
answer
to
that
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
challenge,
i
suppose,
they
claim
the
perjury
rule
does
not
apply.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
exception?
justice
felix
frankfurter
none
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
even
by
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
--
what
is
the
punishment
as
enlisted
that
there
is
a
statute
dealing
with
false
appeal
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
made
criminal
by
federal
enactment
and
the
various
punishments
which
is
affixed
to
them
--
which
are
affixed
to
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
that
short
--
short
circumstance,
if
you
got
one
(inaudible)
why
do
we
bother
about
this
that
are
--
if
it
arises
because
of
its
--
if
--
if
it
all
turns
on
whether
or
not
the
perjury
rule
apply
and
if
we
invoked
it
by
(inaudible)
to
deny,
do
you
need
anything
else?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
sometimes
forget
that.
i
have
six
reasons
that
i
assume
are
enforceable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
--
the
hammer
case
conceded
the
weiler.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
an
old
--
what
you
young
lawyers
call
an
old
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
14
years
ago.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
was
it
--
hammer
was
the
supporting
verdict,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
court
held
that
perjuries
following
perjury
may
be
tried
in
the
same
case
and
would
be
observed
on
--
would
be
observed
that
have
a
separate
standards.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
hammer
way
back
275?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
it
said?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
it
like
that
when
i
read
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that
this
court
has
rules
that
wherever
falsity
is
an
ingredient
of
the
offense
that
perjury
must
be
applied?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
well,
we
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
discuss
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
said
that
the
rule
applied
to
subornation
of
perjury
as
it
did
in
perjury
and
it
lead
on
to
say
that
falsity
is
an
ingredient
in
both.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
different
thing
from
saying
wherever
falsity
is
an
ingredient
you
must
have
the
perjury
rule?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all
to
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
you're
right
or
wrong
in
your
general
conclusion,
but
i
think
cases
ought
to
be
confined
to
what
they
desire.
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
there
been
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
any
case
which
applies
the
rule,
the
cases
other
than
perjury
and
subornation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
i
hear
you
say
that
the
punishment
is
severer
under
this
falsity
statute
of
the
perjury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
long
did
the
trial
go?
justice
felix
frankfurter
five
days
a
week?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
telling
what
the
procedure
was
in
the
court
to
which
these
questions
and
answers
that
were
elicited.
is
this
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
you
had
--
and
then
there
was
an
in
camera
or
competing
outside?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
is
this
the
point
two
of
your
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
it's
not
in
theory.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
--
the
judge
interviewed
the
fbi
agent
and
the
united
states
attorney
who
had
issued
the
instruction
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
your
honor.
who
had
issued
the
instructions
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
missed
something.
did
he
bring
this
to
the
attention
of
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
brought
it
to
the
attention
of
the
united
states
attorney?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
know
at
the
court
proceeding,
did
the
juror
spoke
to
united
states
attorney?
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
the
court
assembled
these
people?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
one
of
the
extra
jurors,
the
state
put
in
his
place.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
13th
juror
was
--
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
did
he
know?
had
he
been
approached
too?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
tell
us
just
what
happened
and
where
was
this
called
up.
justice
felix
frankfurter
privately
one
by
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
at
once
move
for
mistrial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
court
denied
that?
is
that
--
that
done
in
open
court
or
in
chambers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
then
made
this
inquiry,
it
means
the
two
jurors,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
go
on
from
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
footnote,
if
you
care
to
give
me
the
exact
date
when
the
fbi
litigated
the
wives
of
the
jurors
themselves
and
the
exact
date
when
this
is
brought
--
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
fbi,
can
you
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
were
the
instructions
given
by
the
attorney
in
the
bryson
case
to
make
its
investigation,
can
we
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
can
we
do
that?
i
have
a
reason
for
a
relevant
reason
as
i
believe
i
have.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
i
--
in
the
interest
at
present,
could
you
(inaudible)
tell
me
this.
how
many
jurors
who
sat
in
the
gold
case
or
actually
sought
to
be
communicated
with
and
were
--
were
communicated
was
either
directed
to
their
wives
by
the
fbi.
justice
felix

two?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
said
something
about
five?
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
the
other
two.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
talking
about
three?
i'd
like
to
be
very
accurate.
i
have
reason
for
asking
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
three
not
two?
you
said
a
minute
ago
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
three?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
left
two?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
sat
throughout?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

mr.
justice
black
tell
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
rendered
the
verdict.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
did
the
judge
examine
--
judge
mclaughlin
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
he
examine
each
one
of
the
juror
to
ask
whether
they
--
how
many
jurors
did
the
judge
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
by
one
or
collectively?
justice
felix
frankfurter
generally
whether
it
didn't
happen?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

happened
sometime
after
the
trial
began
in
march
11
--
march
1954
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
1954?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you're
going
to
tell
me
if
the
evidence
is
somewhere
in
the
record
that
you
find
out,
maybe
the
government
--
maybe
the
government
could
find.
when
it
is
that
the
authority
of
the
fbi
is
--
or
the
attorney
or
whoever
it
was
in
the
fbi
(inaudible)
instructed
communication
that
he
had
with
these
jurors
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
might
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
the
reason
i
asked
about
the
time
is
this
court
decided
the
remmer
case
in
march
8,
1954
and
the
court
of
appeals
decided
(inaudible)
case
where
this
problem
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
authority,
i
suppose
so,
in
may
28.
justice
felix

1953?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
court
of
appeals
at
june
30,
1953.
the
case
was
decided
here
and
we
said
that
that
certainly
giving
him
notice
about
the
seriousness
of
the
problem
on
december
--
on
march
8,
1953.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
had
told
me
all
right,
i
wouldn't
go
to
this
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can
make
judicial
notice
(inaudible)
just
as
lawyers
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
read
the
opinion.
i
wouldn't
go
on
if
it
was
beyond
that
but
just
assume
that
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

what
is
called
the
instruction
of
the
fbi
that
you
just
refer
to
the
united
states
opinion
in
rover?
instruction
or
request,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
it?
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
could
you
quickly
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
take
any
(inaudible)
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
you
mean
the
agent?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
did
abrams
talk
to
him?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
know
when
--
as
i
--
as
i
hear
that
abrams
himself,
after
his
wife
told
him,
went
to
the
fbi
appealing
(inaudible),
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
when
was
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
had
already
--
in
the
meantime,
they
--
they
--
the
fbi
agents,
whose
names
i
do
not
know,
they
had
already
talked
to
morton
and
the
other
person.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this?
what
is
the
evidence
(inaudible)
if
i
may
say
so,
what
is
the
evidence
as
to
communications
made
by
the
three
jurors
who
were
approached
(inaudible)
or
on
a
knowledgeable
way
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
by
the
fbi
agent.
what
was
the
evidence
as
to
communications
made
by
the
three
innocently
(inaudible)
jurors
to
the
other
jurors?
justice
felix
frankfurter
something
as
vague
as
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
no
evidence
--
is
there
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
three
approached
juror,
i
cover
the
wives
with
the
husbands
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
three
approached
jurors
told
some
of
their
fellows,
(inaudible)
that
they
had
been
visited
or
inquired
of
by
the
fbi
agent.
is
there
no
evidence
to
that
effect?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
question
was
that
if
any
of
the
five
so-called
said
something
whether
they
suggest
abrams
or
morton
told
me
about
this
fbi
agent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
lowther,
i
noticed
on
page
1631
of
the
record,
the
court
were
not
calling
the
jurors
singly
to
interpret
to
the
inquiry
of
the
juror
as
to
whether
or
not
the
fact
--
this
is
in
fact
been
contacted
by
telephone
or
personally
or
in
contact
with
the
fbi
agents.
did
the
call
--
did
the
presiding
judge,
when
he
did
call
in
the
jurors,
carry
out
for
the
50,000
and
would
ask
the
jurors
namely
whether
they
are
--
they
contacted
an
fbi
agent?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
in
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
mentioned
or
what
(inaudible)
myself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
you
have
certain
times
after
a
number
of
serious
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
1001
in
your
brief,
is
it
printed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that
page
specifically?
does
that
affiliate
the
requirement
of
the
two
witness
rule
in
perjury
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
how
--
how
could
you
say
that
that's
in
response
to
a
suggestion
in
wyler
that
can
--
no
legislation
is
abrogated?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
first
case
you
--
you
have
cited?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
couldn't
find
it
in
your
--
your
brief
--
on
your
brief?
i
couldn't
find
it
in
your
list
of
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
citation?
i
don't
care
about
your
--
because
i
know
where
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
sure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
must
be
any
number
of
--
there
are
any
number,
aren't
there?
false
--
statutes
making
it
an
offense
to
make
a
false
statement
about
theirs
passports
and
so
on,
aren't
there
that
many?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
now,
this
question
not
arisen
on
those
other
false
swearing
nontechnical
perjury
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
is
the
justification
in
the
policies
of
the
two-witness
rule
in
a
perjury
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
may
now
say,
to
be
observed
because
of
history
but
what
is
the
source
of
that?
what
justification
has
reached
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
nature
--
the
nature
of
the
conduct
is
penalized
or
adjusted
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
a
murder
is
one
thing
and
terminates
whether
a
man
spoke
something
falsely,
it's
a
very
different
thing,
so
one
may
be
more
heinous
than
the
other.
that's
what
this
court
--
must
have
been
the
(inaudible)
case
that
--
but
instead
the
fact
that
this
rule
is
persistent,
unquestioned
--
unquestionably
in
all
the
jurisdictions.
not
that
i've
put
them
up
just
before
a
term
but
they
speak
some
reason
for
it.
a
rule
like
that
doesn't
persist
merely
because
it
has
a
momentum
like
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
--
your
finding,
a
change
in
legislation
by
the
fact
that
this
has
to
be
brought
within
the
10001
which
is
the
--
which
is
the
generalized
section
about
call
(inaudible)
the
government
conceded,
isn't
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
merely
drives
one
to
finding
out
what
1001
requires.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
nothing
on
this
subject.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can't
ask
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
essential
difference
mean
the
issue
on
that
subject
in
this
case
and
what
the
court
decided
in
general?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
proportion
of
the
jurors
--
of
the
petit
juries
consisted
of
government
employees?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
--
what
department
were
the
government
employees?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
--
before
you
close,
may
i
ask?
you
referred
to
the
perjury
problem.
the
court
refused
or
requested
to
charge
the
two
witnesses.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know,
i
ought
to
know
but
i
don't.
did
the
court
charge
that
there
must
be
corroboration
of
the
party?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
request
made
for
such
a
charge
and
denied?
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
it
all
turns
on
--
on
the
granting
--
refused
to
grant
the
two
witnesses.
