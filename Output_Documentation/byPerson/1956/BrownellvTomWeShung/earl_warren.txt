chief
justice
earl
warren
number
43,
herbert
brownell
jr.,
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
petitioner
versus
tom
we
shung.
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
mr.
davis,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
i
--
i
get
the
distinction
very
clearly
between
your
exclusion
and
deportation
cases,
but
i
wish
i
could
get
as
clearly
the
--
the
reason
why
you
object
to
--
declaratory
relief
in
exclusion
cases.
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question,
the
only
thing
i
got
out
of
your
answer
was
that
it
took
more
time.
now,
what
i
would
--
that
maybe
enough
--
that
maybe
enough
to
make
a
distinction,
but
what
i
would
like
to
know
from
you,
is
there
anything
other
than
the
--
the
additional
time
that
it
will
take
in
that
procedure.
is
there
--
is
there
any
different
in
the
scope
of
--
of
review
or
relief
or
anything
in
expense
to
the
government
or
anything
that
would
cost
the
--
this
position
on
your
--
your
part
to
be
against
to
declaratory
relief
in
this
--
in
this
case?
i
understood
that
a
year
or
two
ago
that
the
--
the
attorney
general
was
in
favor
of
--
of
judicial
review
in
these
cases.
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
as
to
--
not
as
to
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
anything
in
the
committee
reports,
it
would
conflict
with
what
senator
mccarran
said?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis
i'm
afraid
our
questions
prevented
you
from
answering
justice
frankfurter's
question.
you
may
take
time
to
do
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
you
--
you
said
that
congress
had
made
specific
provision
for
the
people
who
claim
citizenship
to
have
the
right
of
habeas
corpus
and
no
other
relief
as
they
attempted
to
enter
the
country.
but
that
--
if
the
position
of
the
respondent
is
correct
here
that
it
would
give
this
noncitizen
a
greater
right.
what
i
would
like
to
--
by
--
by
giving
them
either
or
both
habeas
corpus
or
declaratory
relief,
what
i
would
like
to
ask
you
is
this.
can
you
conceive
of
any
cases
where
it
would
be
necessary
in
the
case
of
a
noncitizen
to
have
declaratory
relief
or
no
relief
at
all
whereas
on
the
other
hand
perhaps
a
--
a
citizen,
a
claimant
of
citizenship
would
--
would
always
have
habeas
corpus
open
to
it?
i
don't
know
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
just
one
more
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
pardon
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
going
to
say
just
one
more
thing.
did
you
have
enough
to
only
to
answer
justice
frankfurter
or
not?
we
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you
mr.
davis.
mr.
reiner.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
in
your
briefs
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
know
where?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
we
could
follow.
