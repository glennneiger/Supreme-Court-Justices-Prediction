mr.
andrew
reiner
may
it
please
the
court.
the
principle
question
presented
here
is
not
as
stated
by
the
petitioner
as
to
whether
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952
authorizes
judicial
review
other
than
habeas
corpus
in
an
exclusion
case.
but
the
question,
the
principal
question
is
whether
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
precludes
the
use
of
a
declaratory
judgment
action
in
an
exclusion
case.
we
contend
that
the
court
below
has
correctly
followed
this
court's
decision
in
shaughnessy
against
pedreiro,
349
u.s.48.
judicial
review
is
not
precluded
in
exclusion
cases
by
the
express
or
the
implied
language
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952.
the
administrative
procedure
act,
the
apa
on
the
other
hand
requires
a
specific
exemption,
an
express
exemption
in
order
to
preclude
a
judicial
review
and
such
express
exemption
is
entirely
lacking
here.
the
provisions
for
administrative
finality
of
exclusion
and
deportation
proceedings
utilize
the
same
language
and
they
should
be
given
the
same
meaning.
the
pertinent
considerations
of
statutory
language
and
legislative
history
and
practical
considerations
support
the
view
that
the
lower
court
decision
should
not
be
disturbed.
we
also
contend
that
in
this
case,
a
status
question
is
presented
namely
whether
tom
we
shung
is
the
son
of
an
american
citizen,
veteran
of
the
second
world
war.
and
as
such
status
question,
it
is
reviewable
under
this
court's
decisions
in
heikkila
against
barbers,
345
u.s.229,
as
a
true
status
question.
i
would
like
to
come
immediately
to
the
heart
of
the
problem
and
state
that
in
pedreiro,
the
court
has
decided
that
the
words,
the
attorney
general's
decision
is
final
apply
to
administrative
finality
and
that
it
was
reviewable,
a
deportation
order
was
reviewable
in
a
declaratory
judgment
action.
if
you
will
look
at
section
236
(c)
which
deals
with
exclusion
decisions,
you
will
find
that
the
special
inquiry
officers'
order
is
final
except
if
it's
reverse
by
the
--
on
appeal
to
the
attorney
general
which
meant
that
administratively
speaking,
the
attorney
general's
order
was
final.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
another
part
of
the
section,
236
(b),
it
does
refer
to
the
final
order
of
exclusion
of
the
attorney
general.
the
administrative
procedures
act
which
was
enacted
in
1946
followed
a
period
of
about
30
--
30
years,
the
1917
basic
immigration
act.
and
during
these
30
years,
the
number
of
administrative
agencies
of
the
government
as
our
government's
business
became
more
complicated
and
more
complex
has
increased
tremendously
a
millions
of
persons
in
the
united
states
both
citizens
and
aliens
had
to
do
business
with
these
administrative
agencies.
and
congress
sort
of
handed
down
a
new
magna
carta
to
the
people
in
the
united
states
assuring
them
fair
proceedings
before
these
administrative
agencies.
and
also
safeguarding
the
people
against
erroneous
decisions
of
these
administrative
agencies
and
assuring
them
that
there
will
be
adequate
judicial
review.
section
10
of
the
apa
very
clearly
states
that
except
where
the
statute
forbid
such
judicial
review
over
agency
action
is
relegated
to
agency
discretion
that
a
person
who
feels
that
he
has
been
aggrieved
or
wronged
by
an
agency
action
has
the
right
to
seek
a
judicial
review
and
it
says
that
this
--
the
forms
of
this
judicial
review
maybe
declaratory
judgment
action,
maybe
an
injunction
action
for
mandatory
injunction
or
other
or
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
section
12
of
the
apa
says
that
any
subsequent
legislation
in
order
to
exempt
from
section
10
of
the
apa,
the
statute
or
the
agency
must
expressly
do
so
such
expressed
preclusion
of
judicial
review
of
the
forms
described
in
section
10
is
not
present
here.
in
pedreiro
against
shaughnessy,
mr.
justice
black
pointed
to
the
practical
difficulties
of
submitting
an
alien
even
the
deportation
case
and
it
can
be
taken
in
an
exclusion
case
to
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
and
--
and
the
court
stated
in
that
case,
if
i
may
quote,
and
it
would
certainly
be
in
keeping
--
not
be
in
keeping
with
either
of
these
acts,
the
apa
or
the
1952
act
to
require
a
person
or
the
deported
or
i
may
substitute
order
of
exclusion
to
go
to
jail
in
order
to
obtain
a
review
by
a
court
because
the
practical
situation
here
is
that
respondent,
we
shung
tom,
has
been
in
the
united
states
for
nine
years.
out
of
those
nine
years,
he
spent
10
years
--
10
months
in
detention
and
for
eight
years
and
about
three
months,
he
has
lived
with
his
father
in
the
united
states.
and
for
him
to
submit
now
to
habeas
corpus
proceeding
would
mean
according
to
the
government's
brief
that
he
must
go
to
the
port
of
entry
in
san
francisco,
surrender
to
the
government,
go
to
jail
and
then
take
his
chances
as
to
whether
he
can
obtain
habeas
corpus
proceeding
before
the
government
deports
him.
and
there
are
cases
on
the
books
where
the
government
deported
persons
before
they
were
able
to
petition
for
habeas
corpus.
and
then
if
he
is
--
successfully
in
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
then
he
would
have
to
recross
the
united
states
and
come
back
to
his
father
to
the
east
coast.
it
would
also
mean
in
this
case
and
in
similar
cases
that
he
would
have
to
hire
new
counsel
on
the
west
coast
who
would
have
to
get
familiarize
himself
with
the
facts
of
this
case
and
--
and
it
would
mean
additional
cost
to
him.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
mr.
davis'
argument
that
the
legislative
history
of
this
act,
the
1952
act
supports
his
contention
that
this
court
must
look
for
something
in
the
statute
that
is
not
there,
namely
that
congress
intended
that
in
exclusion
cases
only
habeas
corpus
proceeding
should
be
available.
we
deny
that
the
legislative
background
of
a
statute
should
be
controlling
as
against
the
express
language
of
the
statute.
we
contend
that
if
the
words
have
been
interpreted
by
the
courts
to
mean
one
thing,
in
one
section
they
have
to
mean
the
same
thing
in
another
section.
and
in
this
connection,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
the
pedreiro
case,
this
court
has
defined
final
as
meaning
administratively
final
and
it
meant
that
judicial
finality
has
not
as
yet
come
about
and
that
actions
under
section
10
of
the
act
can
be
maintained.
now
then,
if
the
court
will
look
at
a
prior
interpretation
of
such
a
problem,
you
will
find
it
in
pampanga
sugar
mills
against
trinidad
where
two
sections
of
the
philippines
administrative
code
were
considered
and
the
petitioner
there
claimed
that
merchant
in
one
section
meant
something
else
than
merchant
in
another
section.
and
the
court
held
that
the
meaning
of
the
word
in
one
section
will
be
given
the
same
meaning
in
another
section,
unless
there
has
been
another
definition
put
on
it
by
the
legislature.
i
would
like
to
call
your
attention
also
to
the
fact
that
this
1952
act
begins
with
section
101
which
is
a
section
dealing
with
definitions
of
words
and
phrases.
and
that
on
certain
words
that
appear
in
the
statute,
the
act
states
for
instance
that
a
child
means
something
else
in
--
under
title
1
and
title
2
of
the
act
as
it
means
in
title
3
but
it
does
not
say
so
about
the
word
final.
i
also
wish
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
that
the
legislative
history
is
not
in
all
favorable
to
the
governments.
for
instance
that
very
report
that
mr.
davis
referred
to
of
the
conference
at
the
end
of
--
of
various
amendments
and
when
the
final
bill
was
shaped
stated
as
follows.
"having
extensively
considered
the
problem
--
mr.
andrew
reiner
--
of
judicial
review
--
mr.
andrew
reiner
i
think
it
is
contained
in
the
brief.
mr.
andrew
reiner
yes,
mr.
andrew
reiner
page
34
on
--
on
the
government's
brief.
yes,
thank
you
very
much.
having
--
this
is
--
it
begins
on
page
33,
the
end
of
the
page
and
goes
over
to
page
34
and
it
says
having
extensively
considered
the
problem
of
judicial
review,
the
(inaudible)
are
satisfied
that
procedures
provided
in
the
bill
adapted
to
the
necessities
of
national
security
and
the
protection
of
economic
and
social
welfare
of
the
citizens
of
this
country
remain
within
the
framework
and
the
pattern
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
the
same
court
of
judicial
procedure
is
afforded
the
alien
in
both
exclusion
and
the
deportation
proceeding.
they
have
referred
to
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
so
did
the
sponsors
of
this
bill.
senators
mccarran
and
walter
when
amendments
were
presented,
when
their
--
their
bills
were
attacked,
stated
on
several
occasions
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
remains.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
same
congressman
and
senator
were
the
sponsors
of
this
administrative
procedure
act.
and
mr.
walter
spoke
very
affectionately
about
the
apa
and
he
said,
“you
will
remember
the
walter-logan
act
which
became
the
administrative
procedure
act.”
and
he
says
it
is
very
close
to
my
heart
that
people
should
have
the
right
of
judicial
review.
the
petitioner
has
given
several
sections
of
the
law
where
exemption
from
this
rule
of
judicial
review
is
accomplished
by
the
1952
act.
i
only
have
to
quote
the
old
maxim
that
the
exception
strengthens
the
rule
and
that
is
absolutely
so
here
and
very
clearly
illustrated
where
congress
wanted
to
relegate
or
limit
the
judicial
review
to
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
they
did
so
in
express
language.
for
instance,
they
did
it
in
sections
242
(a)
and
(c).
both
these
sections
refer
to
the
testing
of
the
reasonableness
or
the
detention
of
the
bond.
however,
you
will
note
that
this
was
very
logical
because
habeas
corpus
is
germane
to
determining
the
reasonableness
of
detention
and
--
and
the
release
on
bond.
again,
in
section
360,
section
360
has
a
history
in
the
1940
nationality
act.
the
1940
nationality
act
contained
the
provision
section
503
of
that
act
which
said
the
persons
who
claim
american
citizenship
and
who
are
refused
a
visa
or
travel
documents
to
the
united
states.
i
--
i
have
to
correct
that
visa.
it
doesn't
apply
to
one
who
claims
american
citizenship.
travel
documents,
united
states
passports,
(inaudible)
declaratory
judgment
action.
this
provision
after
an
experience
with
it
for
a
while
showed
that
it
lead
to
all
kinds
of
abuse
that
persons,
spurious
citizens
who
really
were
not
citizens
of
the
united
states
obtain
certificates
of
identities
in
order
to
prosecute
such
declaratory
action
suits
in
the
united
states
and
then
came
here
and
if
they
lost,
well
they
may
have
remained
in
the
united
states
further.
and
it
was
because
of
this
reason,
this
very
specific
reason
that
section
360
(c)
was
based
in
the
act
and
it
does
not
apply
to
all
american
citizens.
it
is
not
right
to
say
that
american
citizens
have
less
right
than
alien's
have.
that
is
not
true.
it
only
applies
to
one
group
of
claimed
alleged
american
citizen
who
obtain
certificates
of
identities
and
come
here
then
with
those
certificates
of
identities
and
are
told
when
the
certificates
of
identities
are
issued.
your
admission
to
the
united
states
will
depend
on
whether
you
are
admitted
at
the
port
of
entry.
and
these
persons
are
not
release
but
are
kept
in
custody
until
the
decision
is
made.
and
then
if
they're
not
satisfied
with
the
ruling
of
the
attorney
general
then
they
have
this
one
review
here
in
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
this
respondent
here
came
here
as
an
admitted
alien
and
he
said,
“admit
me
to
the
united
states.
i
am
the
son
of
a
naturalized
american
citizen
who
served
in
world
war
ii
and
i'm
admissible
under
this
act.”
of
course
there
are
all
kinds
of
difficulties
which
appeared
in
some
of
these
chinese
cases
where
there
are
no
the
proof
of
relationship
because
they
know
nothing
about
making
records
in
china
or
haven't
in
the
past
and
i
don't
think
that
they
do
it
either
at
the
present
time
and
then
these
difficulties
of
identification
arise.
that
is
the
problem
here.
now,
this
man
has
been
out
for
eight
long
years
and
he
would
like
to
finally
get
a
determination
as
to
whether
he
can
stay
here.
the
court
can
draw
on
his
determined
and
dogged
fight
that
the
chinese
cook,
the
father
and
the
young
chinese
waiter
have
fought
through
these
great
courts
of
the
united
states
for
eight
long
years.
this
must
show
to
the
court
that
they
--
their
cause
is
just.
i
would
like
to
say
yet
above
the
question
of
status
in
the
heikkila
against
barbers,
mr.
justice
clark
has
stated
that
heikkila
did
not
bring
himself
within
the
henke
and
kristensen
cases
which
one
dealt
with
the
eligibility
for
citizenship,
the
other
one
with
citizenship
question.
heikkila
was
a
deportation
case.
it
wasn't
a
status
question
and
so
the
court
said
what
we
contend
here
that
this
case
is
status
question.
it
involves
a
true
question
of
status
namely
is
we
shung
tom,
the
son
of
an
american
citizen?
because
if
he
is,
this
gives
him
a
status.
this
gives
him
a
status
which
makes
him
eligible
for
entry
to
the
united
states.
and
in
the
heikkila
and
the
kristensen
and
the
(inaudible)
rulings
such
status
question
can
be
determined
in
a
declaratory
judgment
action
and
we
--
we
contend
that
this
can
be
done
here
too.
mr.
andrew
reiner
i
--
i
have
discussed
360
(c)
your
honor.
i
--
i
believe
that
360
(a)
merely
states
that
an
american
--
one
claiming
to
be
an
american
citizen
must
test
his
case
in
habeas
corpus
proceeding
if
the
question
of
his
american
citizenship
came
up
in
an
exclusion
proceeding,
in
other
words,
if
he
was
one
of
these
men
who
came
in
on
a
certificate
of
identity.
mr.
andrew
reiner
no.
this
man
came
in
as
an
alien
seeking
an
entry
as
an
immigrant.
he
--
there
was
a
special
act
of
congress
to
allow
the
wife's
and
minor
children
of
veteran
of
second
world
war
to
come
into
the
united
states
and
that's
how
he
sought
entry.
mr.
andrew
reiner
no,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
reiner
no.
we
consider
that
the
scope
of
review
is
the
same
in
both
habeas
corpus
and
in
declaratory
judgment
action.
we
only
feel
that
a
man
in
--
in
the
position
of
--
of
the
respondent
here
should
not
be
required
to
go
into
custody
which
as
mr.
justice
harlan's
stated
might
be
able
collusive
and
there
are
cases
decided
by
this
court
as
up
against
the
united
states
is
the
last
one
of
them
in
which
the
--
which
the
court
in
that
case
the
circuit
court
stated
that
a
voluntary
submission
to
incarceration
cannot
be
the
basis
of
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
there's
also
ex
parte
simon
which
said
that.
there
are
other
difficulties
too
with
denying
this
man
declaratory
judgment
action
--
mr.
andrew
reiner
it
maybe
so
your
honor.
generally
speaking,
this
man
--
these
people
are
stopped
at
the
port.
and
--
and
then
the
habeas
corpus
is
brought.
but
in
--
in
our
situation
here,
if
they're
excluded
and
they
are
out
for
--
for
sometime,
they
will
release
them
on
parole.
mr.
andrew
reiner
if
he
came
with
a
certificate
of
identity.
mr.
andrew
reiner
yes.
mr.
andrew
reiner
yes,
sir.
mr.
andrew
reiner
360
(a)
does,
360
(c)
--
mr.
andrew
reiner
yes.
mr.
andrew
reiner
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
no,
sir.
mr.
andrew
reiner
there
is
no
claim
of
citizenship
here.
mr.
andrew
reiner
only
if
he's
--
the
question
of
his
citizenship
arose
in
an
exclusion
proceeding.
mr.
andrew
reiner
that's
right
while
he's
coming
here.
mr.
andrew
reiner
deported
(inaudible)
to
the
united
states
--
excuse
me.
mr.
andrew
reiner
in
--
applying
only
to
a
very
limited
group
of
people
and
in
--
in
practical
effect,
it
applies
to
these
people
who
convinced
the
american
consul
abroad
to
give
them
a
certificate
of
identity
so
that
they
can
come
to
the
united
states
and
test
the
question
of
their
citizenship
because
often
the
truth
is
only
available
in
the
united
states
in
the
form
of
witnesses.
the
american
consul
cannot
make
a
final
determination
as
to
whether
they
are
or
are
not
citizens.
there
is
no
question
that
the
respondent
here
is
an
admitted
alien.
his
father
was
an
alien
and
became
a
naturalized
citizen
and
then
served
in
the
war
and
this
entitled
his
son
to
come
in
here.
he
thought
he
was
coming
here
and
he's
gaining
admission.
there
was
no
question.
he
was
not
warned
that
he
may
not
be
admitted
to
the
united
states.
he
was
excluded
because
some
officer
did
not
believe
that
he
was
the
son
of
this
man.
mr.
andrew
reiner
your
honor,
i
--
i
may
not
understand
you.
if
you
--
mr.
andrew
reiner
this
is
an
exclusion
case,
yes.
mr.
andrew
reiner
right.
mr.
andrew
reiner
that
is
absolutely
right.
i
--
i
--
mr.
andrew
reiner
that
is
right.
mr.
andrew
reiner
that
is
right.
mr.
andrew
reiner
there
is
a
difference
between
exclusion
and
--
mr.
andrew
reiner
there
is
no
citizenship
issue
here
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
reiner
there
is
no
citizenship
issue.
mr.
andrew
reiner
status
question
as
to
whether
he's
the
son
--
mr.
andrew
reiner
--
of
--
of
this
--
this
american
citizen.
i
--
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
finally
to
one
--
a
little
bit
of
information
that
came
to
us
during
the
recess,
namely,
there
is
at
least
a
dicta
in
a
decision
of
judge
holtzoff
in
a
deportation
case
which
says
that
the
result
is
that
in
the
habeas
corpus
proceedings
to
review
a
deportation
or
exclusion
of
the
immigration
authority.
it
is
not
enough
that
this
be
--
that
there
be
some
evidence
to
sustain
of
the
findings
of
fact.
they
must
be
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
both
in
deportation
and
exclusion
proceeding.
this
is

mr.
andrew
reiner
no,
it
is
not
raised
here.
mr.
andrew
reiner
no.
mr.
andrew
reiner
scope
of
review
--
no,
sir.
mr.
andrew
reiner
we
don't
raise
it.
mr.
andrew
reiner
no
--
no,
sir.
we
ask
that
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
be
affirmed.
