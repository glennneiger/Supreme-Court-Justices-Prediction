justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
article
and
what
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
follow
--
i
follow
on
that.
i
was
not
less
clear
about
this
--
my
own
thought
whether
in
your
answer
to
justice
harlan
which
indicated
a
difference
in
the
scope,
in
the
content
that
in
a
substantive
relieve
that
can
be
got
in
declaratory
judgment
as
against
habeas
corpus.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
would
that
--
i
assumed
you
--
you
read
about
it.
would
it
be
different
whether
it's
declaratory
judgment
or
habeas
corpus?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
substantial
evidence
is
of
course
certainly
doesn't
mean
that
there's
enough
rulings
on
that
observant
of
the
usual
exclusionary
rules
of
evidence
if
they
rule
on
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
you
may
have
substantiality
and
that
either
without
the
substantial
--
the
other
types
of
litigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
--
and
that's
why
you're
here,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
going
to
stop
you
if
i
may
a
minute
to
pass
whether
in
the
course
of
the
congressional
(inaudible)
in
the
course
of
the
congressional
discussion,
you
just
said
they
are
certain
that
in
light
of
fact
because
that
discussion
of
course
repeated
out
as
if
(inaudible)
but
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
must
have
been
either
contemporaneous
with
or
later
than
some
of
the
decision
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
courts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
if
there's
any
--
or
--
was
the
intention
of
congress
directed
to
what
the
lower
court
--
courts
of
appeal
has
been
doing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
--
no
lower
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
are
those
--
are
those
adverted
to?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
district
--
the
district
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
to
the
exclusion
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
there's
nothing
in
the
reports
that
explicitly
directed
itself
to
the
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
was
in
charge
of
the
bill.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
page
--
what
page
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
33.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
where
is
that?
where
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
32,
but
he
said,
never
been
aware
of
that,
what
you
just
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
(inaudible)
clear
to
me
as
it
is
to
you
because
if
the
statute
is
clear,
it's
the
end
of
the
matter.
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
yes,
but
all
i'm
saying
no
to
is,
your
paraphrase
(inaudible)
because
as
the
heikkila
opinion
shows,
i
thought
that
showed,
the
word
review
in
(inaudible)
it's
a
word
of
many
faces,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
he
took
the
view
of
opposing
the
--
what
you
--
the
morse
amendment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
saying
is
that
he
was
wrong
in
saying
there
had
been
no
review
of
exclusion
orders
when
he
was
talking.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
--
mr.
davis,
(inaudible)
elucidation
to
go
on
this
subject
that
can
save
time
since
your
time
is
running
out.
if
i
ask
you
this
specific
question,
assume
that
the
content
of
review,
using
the
term
in
the
--
that
the
judiciary
could
do
something,
assuming
that
the
content
of
review
by
declaratory
judgment
is
no
broader,
a
coextensive
way
and
these
are
limited
as
it
would
be
on
the
--
as
it
is
on
habeas
corpus,
is
there
any
practical
consideration
other
than
the
element
of
speech
and
expedition?
and
i
join
the
chief
justice
in
saying
that
--
that's
not
any
(inaudible)
making
very
relevant
in
what
you
say
the
statute
(inaudible)
but
is
there,
forgetting
the
legislative
history,
forgetting
the
reading
of
the
statute,
assuming
that
declaratory
judgment
doesn't
open
the
door
anymore
than
habeas
corpus
does.
is
there
any
other
practical
objection
except
there's
an
objection
of
appropriate
speed
with
disposition
of
the
habeas
corpus
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
to
just
that
he
(inaudible)
to
be
dealt
with
by
calendar
that
amendment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
i'd
like
to
be
(inaudible)
you
mean
that
the
declaratory
judgment
would
have
to
be
brought
in
a
district?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
say
that
a
declaratory
judgment
venue
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
the
district?
justice
felix
frankfurter
another
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
we
have
to
--
in
order
to
allow
it
in
st.albans,
we
have
to
hold
whatever
the
case
is
does
not
require
that
the
commission
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
--
you
gave
figures
of
the
rejection
of
incoming
aliens
a
minute
ago
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
deportation
cases?
do
you
have
the
figures?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
deportation
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
deportation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
the
fiscal
year.
i
mean
you
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mind
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
deportation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
--
how
many
impressions
did
we
find
to
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
don't
understand
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
forgive
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
360
only
applies
those
of
the
residents
in
this
country.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
mr.
justice
reed
was
asking
you
about
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
regarding
360
(a),
wasn't
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
360
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
conclusion
--
that
conclusion
varies
an
entry
and
admission
they
--
may
derive
whether
it's
declaratory
judgment
or
habeas
corpus.
if
--
if
such
a
determination
is
made
in
a
declaratory
proceeding,
he
would
also
be
(inaudible)
without
judicial
review
to
the
court
for
determination.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
an
exclusion
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
--
except
within
the
very
narrow
limits
of
reviewing
exclusion
determinations.
exclusion
determination
may
also
involve
an
adverse
decision
in
a
claim
of
citizenship
whether
an
actual
citizenship
or
derived
the
citizenship.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
the
--
the
distress
on
the
fact
that
he
is
claiming
citizenship
through
his
father
doesn't
advance
the
--
the
opportunity
of
entry
whether
the
proceeding
is
by
declaratory
judgment
or
by
habeas
corpus.
justice
felix
frankfurter
unlike
--
unlike
this
case
of
a
deportation.
if
this
--
if
--
if
this
petition
--
if
this
respondent
or
a
deportee
or
sought
to
be
deported
on
some
of
the
allowable
grounds
of
deportation
and
he
claim
citizenship,
the
--
the
issue
of
citizenship
could
not
be
administratively
foreclosed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
be
judicially
determined.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
you've
got
a
very
great
big
difference
in
exclusion
and
deportation.
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
specific
question
in
regard
to
the
citizenship
issue.
there
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
the
status
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
issue
raised
here
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
requirement
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
to
me
that
would
be
a
very
troublesome
thing.
i
hope
you
mention
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
substantial
evidence
in
immigration
cases.
