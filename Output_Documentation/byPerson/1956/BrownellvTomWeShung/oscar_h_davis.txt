mr.
oscar
h.
davis
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
immigration
case
from
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
and
it
presents
the
court
for
the
seventh
time
in
six
years
with
an
issue
of
whether
an
immigration
order
may
be
reviewed
by
declaratory
judgment
or
as
the
government
contends
in
this
case
by
habeas
corpus
alone.
i
said
for
the
seventh
time
in
six
years
but
i
hasten
to
add
that
it
comes
up
in
a
new
context
in
this
case
because
the
issue
here
is
whether
an
exclusion
order
for
an
acknowledged
alien
was
never
been
in
this
country
who
seeks
to
enter
the
country,
an
exclusion
order
can
be
judicially
reviewed
by
declaratory
judgment
as
the
district
court
of
columbia
circuit
held
or
whether
it
can
be
reviewed
only
in
proceedings
for
habeas
corpus
as
we
contend.
the
background
of
the
case
is
this,
in
a
--
in
a
prior
case
involving
this
same
respondent
tom
we
shung
in
december
1953,
three
years
ago,
the
court
held
per
curiam
that
an
exclusion
order
under
the
prior
act
under
the
immigration
act
of
1917
up
to
the
time
of
the
1952
act
could
be
reviewed
judicially
only
by
habeas
corpus.
in
the
spring
of
1955,
i
should
add
in
relation
to
that
that
the
court
had
made
the
same
holding
in
relation
to
deportation
orders
under
the
prior
statute
in
a
case
called
heikkila
against
barber.
but
then
the
issue
arose
under
the
new
act,
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952
and
it
came
up
first
to
this
court
in
a
deportation
case.
in
the
spring
of
1955,
in
shaughnessy
against
pedreiro,
the
court
held
that
the
1952
act
made
a
difference
that
under
the
1952
act
deportation
orders
are
reviewable
by
declaratory
judgment
as
well
as
by
habeas
corpus.
the
issue
here
is
whether
the
same
holding
should
be
made
as
to
exclusion
orders.
the
court
below
and
respondent
contend
that
this
a
case
of
course
of
the
hide
going
with
the
hair
that
exclusion
orders
are
governed
by
the
same
principles
as
deportation
orders
and
our
position
is
to
the
contrary.
and
we
think
that
exclusion
orders
are
different
from
deportation
orders
under
the
1952
statute
for
four
different
reasons.
one,
that
the
particular
statutory
provisions
and
the
general
statutory
context
are
different
for
exclusion
as
distinguished
from
deportation.
and
two,
that
there
is
a
historic
constitutional
and
legal
difference
between
alien
seeking
to
enter
the
country
and
those
aliens
resident
in
the
country
that
there
was
a
historic
legal
and
constitutional
difference
between
exclusion
and
deportation.
and
third,
we
suggest
that
there
are
--
that
the
specific
legislative
history
of
the
1952
act
dealing
with
this
particular
subject
is
different
with
respect
to
exclusion
and
it
was
for
deportation.
fourth
and
lastly,
we
think
that
the
practical
considerations
which
moved
the
court
in
the
pedreiro
case
to
hold
that
deportation
could
be
reviewable
by
declaratory
judgment
do
not
exist
with
respect
to
an
alien
seeking
to
enter
the
country
and
therefore
the
result
should
be
different.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
mr.
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
there
is
a
practical
difference.
the
first
is
possibly
the
difference
in
the
scope
of
review.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
we
think
there
is.
if
i
may
recall
mr.
justice
harlan
at
the
argument
of
the
pedreiro
case
which
i
argued,
you
asked
me
the
same
question
with
relation
to
deportation.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
as
to
deportation,
yes.
there
was
no
difference
because
the
1952
statute
incorporates
in
haec
verba,
the
substantial
evidence
rule
at
the
deportation
orders
that
requires
the
deportation
orders
must
be
based
upon
substantial
prevalent
of
evidence
and
we
could
not.
and
we
cound
not
end
the
declaratory
judgment
statute
and
section
10
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
lay
down
the
same
standard
for
review,
substantial
evidence.
in
the
light
of
that
we
could
not
say
that
the
scope
of
review
of
a
deportation
order
under
the
1952
statute
would
be
different
in
habeas
corpus
from
what
it
was
in
declaratory
judgment.
but
i
make
--
do
not
make
the
same
concession
here.
with
respect
to
exclusion,
the
1952
statute
does
not
contain
anywhere
near
the
same
restrictions
that
it
does
with
respect
to
deportation.
in
particular,
it
does
not
say
that
the
order
has
to
be
based
on
substantial
evidence.
and
historically,
the
review
of
--
by
courts
of
exclusion
orders
has
been
--
we
think
in
actual
practice
narrower
in
habeas
corpus
as
they've
always
been
reviewed
up
to
now,
narrower
than
it
has
been
in
deportation
cases.
in
the
very
beginning
when
--
when
these
issues
first
arose
in
the
late
1880's
and
1890's,
the
court
said
flatly
that
there
would
be
no
review
of
the
facts
at
all
and
they
adhered
to
that
position
even
--
even
supporting
judgments
below
where
the
district
court
had
refused
even
to
--
to
admit
any
facts
into
evidence
at
all.
all
that
was
submitted
was
the
order
of
--
of
the
immigration
officer
excluding
the
alien.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
sir.
it
--
the
claim
of
citizenship
was
different.
but
i
point
out
here
that
there
was
no
claim
of
citizenship.
this
is
an
alien
who
claims
to
be
an
alien.
there
is
no
claim
of
citizenship.
one
of
my
arguments
is
that
if
--
if
tom
we
shung
had
claimed
to
be
a
citizen
under
the
new
act,
section
360
which
is
piecemeal
reproduced
part
in
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief
and
part
in
the
appendix
to
respondent's
brief.
if
tom
we
shung
had
claimed
to
be
a
citizen
the
1952
statute
made
it
absolutely
clear
that
he
would
have
to
proceed
by
habeas
corpus
because
the
--
that
section
360
says
that
if
a
person
claims
to
be
an
american
citizen
who
is
outside
the
country,
he
must
seek
a
certificate
of
identity
from
the
secretary
of
state
and
proceed
to
this
country
and
then
he
shall
be
treated
as
--
in
admission
proceedings
and
the
statute
says
specifically.
he
can
test
the
order
of
exclusion
by
habeas
corpus
--
habeas
corpus
and
not
otherwise.
even
if
he's
in
this
country,
even
if
he's
in
the
united
states,
the
statute
says
that
he
cannot
use
declaratory
judgment
proceeding
if
the
issue
of
his
nationality
arose
in
an
exclusion
proceeding
under
the
1952
statute
or
the
preceding
statute.
and
so
if
i
may
anticipate
my
arguments
somewhat,
it
is
a
prime
point
of
our
--
of
our
position
here
that
congress
very
specifically
in
the
1952
statute
said
as
to
--
a
citizen
claimants,
people
who
come
from
abroad
and
claim
american
citizenship
they
must
proceed
by
habeas
corpus.
and
of
course,
we
draw
the
corollary
that
it
was
highly
unlikely
that
congress
would
have
provided
that
--
as
to
persons
who
are
admitted
aliens,
acknowledged
aliens
who
make
no
claim
to
citizenship
that
they
would
have
not
only
a
different
remedy
but
two
remedies.
they
would
have
the
declaratory
judgment
remedy
and
also
the
habeas
corpus
remedy
which
would
be
available
to
them.
the
court
below,
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
handle
this
problem
by
simply
saying
that
tom
we
shung
is
--
is
an
alien.
he's
not
an
applicant
for
citizenship
and
therefore
section
360,
the
particular
section
i've
been
talking
about
mr.
justice
reed
didn't
apply
to
him.
this
is
a
little
reminiscent
in
our
mind
of
--
of
something
that
justice
holmes
said
on
circuit
in
the
johnson
case.
he
said
that
the
court
shouldn't
act,
shouldn't
tell
congress
or
legislatures.
we
know
what
you
are
driving
after
because
you
didn't
say
it
in
express
terms
in
haec
verba,
we
will
refuse
to
apply
what
you
have
said.
as
i
said
i've
anticipated
my
argument
which
is
in
--
in
large
part
based
on
the
fact
that
as
to
citizenship
claimants
coming
from
abroad
or
even
in
this
country
whose
claims
for
nationality
is
disputed.
they
have
to
go
through
the
rule
of
habeas
corpus
and
it's
unlikely
that
congress
would
provide
another
remedy,
a
broader
remedy
and
a
duplicate
remedy
for
aliens.
but
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
--
that
tom
we
shung
is
definitely
an
alien.
he
applied
for
admission
at
san
francisco
in
november
1947,
some
nine
years
ago
and
this
is
in
part
one
of
the
--
the
practical
differences
that
the
government
sees,
mr.
justice
harlan.
there
are
special
reasons
why
this
--
this
case
has
been
on
litigation
for
nine
years.
and
one
of
the
reasons
is
that
congress
changed
the
statute
in
the
middle.
but
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
an
alien
who
proceeds
by
the
rule
of
habeas
corpus
will
have
a
greater
time
in
litigation
than
he
who
proceeds
by
habeas
corpus.
habeas
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
a
greater
time
in
litigation
than
he
who
proceeds
by
habeas
corpus.
habeas
corpus
by
the
rules
of
most
of
the
district
is
required
to
be
heard
promptly
within
five
days
because
it's
a
great
writ
which
is
i
think
that
even
under
the
statute
required
to
be
very
promptly.
it
is
disposed
up
promptly.
appeals
are
expedited.
and
the
whole
matter
is
--
is
decided
very
quickly.
declaratory
judgment
is
an
ordinary
civil
action
which
goes
on
the
regular
roles
of
the
court,
regular
calendars
and
is
heard
in
do
course.
and
in
those
--
in
those
districts
like
the
district
of
columbia
where
the
--
the
district
court
is
necessarily
behind,
it
will
be
heard
possibly
one,
two
or
three
years
in
--
and
added
number
comes
up
on
the
calendar.
that
is
a
very
important
difference
that
there
is
a
speed
--
speed
and
determination
of
litigation
on
the
habeas
corpus
which
does
not
generally
exist
under
declaratory
judgment.
and
it's
always
been
stressed
by
this
court
going
back
again
to
the
early
cases
that
with
relation
to
exclusion,
with
relations
to
aliens
who
--
with
aliens
who
are
knocking
at
our
gates,
congress
wanted
speedy
summary
determination
and
they
didn't
want
repeated
rehearings.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
i
think
i
had
not
completed
my
answer
to
that.
i
started
out
to
say
that
in
the
early
years,
the
court
said
there
should
be
no
review
of
the
facts
at
all.
there
has
been
some
relaxation
but
i
cannot
find
anywhere
in
this
court's
opinions
and
with
--
but
as
mattering
of
suggestions
in
lower
court's
opinions
that
in
exclusion,
again
as
distinguished
from
deportation,
the
substantial
evidence
rule
applies.
that
i
think
remains
to
be
litigated.
and
if
one
is
to
follow
above
the
course
of
judicial
discussion
of
this
--
of
this
subject
plus
the
deliberate
omission
by
the
1952
statute
of
the
substantial
evidence
rule
with
relation
to
exclusion
again
is
distinguished
from
deportation.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
with
section
10
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
says
under
the
subsection
(e)
which
deals
with
scope
of
review
that
the
court
shall
reverse
an
administrative
determination
which
is
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
which
led
the
court
in
the
heikkila
case
to
--
to
say
that
unless
congress
gave
clear
--
clear
indication
that
it
wanted
substantial
evidence
it
did
not
fail
that
habeas
corpus
could
be
imposed
as
the
proper
remedy.
in
the
1952
statute,
congress
did
give
as
this
court
has
clear
indication
with
relation
to
deportation.
it
did
not
make
the
same
disposition
of
exclusion.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
and
this
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
that
maybe
true
mr.
justice,
but
i
think
the
time
has
not
yet
come
for
the
government
even
to
admit
that
substantial
evidence
rule
applies
across
the
board
in
exclusion
cases.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
that
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
as
i
say
tom
we
shung
arrived
nine
years
ago
and
we
have
been
litigating
since.
he
was
ordered
excluded
on
the
ground
that
he
was
not
the
son
of
an
american
citizen
as
he
claimed
to
be.
he
claimed
to
be
the
blood
son
of
tom
wing
who
was
an
american
citizen.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
at
the
outset,
i
said
that
the
government
feels
that
there
are
four
differences
with
respect
to
reviewability
between
deportation
orders
and
exclusion
orders.
first,
the
particular
statutory
provisions
and
their
context.
second,
the
history
of
exclusion
as
distinguishing
deportation.
third,
the
specific
legislative
history
of
the
1952
statute
relating
to
reviewability.
and
fourth,
the
practical
considerations.
i
touched
on
--
i
think
all
four
of
those
but
except
possibly
this
specific
legislative
history.
but
if
i
may
i
would
like
to
go
little
further
into
each
of
them.
first,
as
to
the
statutory
provisions
in
the
1952
act
and
the
statutory
context,
the
provision
relating
to
reviewability
or
at
least
the
provision
on
which
the
government
relied
relating
to
reviewability
for
deportation
order
say
specifically
that
the
--
it
says
solely
that
the
order
of
the
attorney
general
relating
to
deportation
shall
be
fine.
now,
the
provision
relating
to
exclusion
is
somewhat
different.
it
provides
that
the
order
of
the
special
inquiry
officer,
the
lowest
administrative
official
shall
be
final
except
it
shall
enlist
it
as
reverse
on
appeal
to
the
attorney
general.
now,
this
difference
is
not
new
to
the
1952
statute.
it
came
in
the
beginning
of
the
immigration
act
in
the
1890s.
as
to
exclusion,
as
to
admission
or
exclusion
of
alien
seeking
to
enter
the
country,
the
provision
has
always
been
that
the
decision
of
the
immigration
authority
at
the
--
at
the
post,
on
appeal
shall
be
final
unless
reversed
on
appeal.
and
the
courts,
this
court
invoking
this
provision
has
made
note
of
the
fact
in
the
early
cases
for
instance
such
as
nishimura
ekiu
and
lem
moon
sing,
the
court
there
said
congress
provided
a
method
of
review.
it
didn't
provide
court
review.
it
provided
an
administrative
review
on
appeal
to
the
head
of
the
department.
first,
it
was
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
on
the
secretary
of
commerce
and
labor,
secretary
of
labor,
and
now
the
attorney
general.
then
there
are
certain
exceptions
even
for
appeals
to
the
attorney
general.
in
certain
security
cases,
the
statute
gives
specific
authority
to
the
special
inquiry
officer
to
hold
the
man
at
the
door
and
provides
for
the
sending
up
of
the
case
to
the
attorney
general.
in
that
--
in
that
case,
the
statute
specifically
says
that
there
shall
be
no
appeal
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
decision
as
to
temporary
exclusion
by
the
special
inquiry
officer.
there
are
also
special
medical
cases
in
which
the
decision
of
the
local
inquiry
officer
shall
be
final
without
appeal
to
the
attorney
general.
thirdly,
there
are
cases
in
which
--
in
which
congress
has
adopted
in
the
1952
statute
a
provision
specifically
saying
that
the
attorney
general
can
bar
alien
seeking
admission
on
the
basis
of
confidential
information
and
without
a
hearing.
that
is
specific
in
the
statute.
if
you
take
all
these
provisions
together,
it
seems
unlikely
that
congress
was
intending
to
expand
judicial
review
for
excluded
aliens
over
what
had
been
existent
under
the
statute
since
the
beginning
of
the
immigration
and
legislation.
and
that's
what
we
think
you
have
to
find
in
the
1952
statute
to
-
to
say
that
there
shall
be
review
by
declaratory
judgment
rather
than
by
habeas
corpus.
as
to
deportation,
the
court
did
find
it
but
we
think
it
cannot
find
it
as
to
exclusion.
i've
mentioned
and
i
express
again
because
we
think
it
very
important
the
provision
of
section
360
which
provides
the
claimants
to
citizenship
must
go
by
the
route
of
habeas
corpus.
that
is
very
specific.
and
congress,
we
think
there
made
it
very
clear
for
a
defined
reason
under
the
earlier
statute,
the
nationality
act
of
1940,
claims
to
citizenship,
both
within
and
without
the
country
could
bring
a
declaratory
judgment
action
against
the
secretary
of
state
or
the
attorney
general
or
some
other
official
who
was
denying
on
the
right
on
the
ground
that
they
were
not
american
citizens.
and
a
large
number
of
declaratory
judgment
actions
were
brought
under
that
statute.
congress
felt
that
that
provision
was
being
misused
particularly
as
a
legislative
history
reveals
by
chinese
who
were
claiming
a
derivative
citizenship
through
the
paternity
--
alleged
paternity
of
american
citizens
of
chinese
descent.
and
so
on
the
1952
act
came
to
be
passed,
congress
repealled
the
old
provision
for
declaratory
judgment
and
established
this
new
provision,
section
360,
which
provided
that
for
persons
within
the
united
states
declaratory
judgment
could
continue
except
--
except
if
the
issue
of
nationality
arose
or
had
arisen
in
an
exclusion
proceeding
and
--
in
those
circumstances,
declaratory
judgment
could
not
be
used.
also,
it
provided
that
–-
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
360
(a).
yes,
mr.
justice.
and
in
360
(c)
which
is
unfortunately
not
printed
in
the
government's
brief
but
is
printed
in
the
respondent's
brief,
on
page
3,
that
congress
provided
that
if
an
alien
outside
the
country
got
a
certificate
of
identity,
i
mean
a
citizenship
claimant
outside
the
country
got
a
--
a
certificate
of
identity,
he
could
come
to
the
united
states
and
seek
admission
and
that
he
would
be
treated
as
a
person
seeking
admission
and
the
decision
by
the
attorney
general
against
his
claim
shall
be
subject
to
review
by
any
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
and
habeas
corpus
proceedings
and
not
otherwise.
there
are
also
other
differences
in
the
statute
between
exclusion
and
deportation
some
of
which
i
have
mentioned
which
we
think
all
bind
together
to
indicate
that
the
system
of
review
for
deportation
was
changed
but
the
system
of
review
for
exclusion
remain
what
it
had
historically
been
since
the
late
1880s.
the
hearing
procedure
is
very
different
as
i
mentioned
before
lunch.
there
is
a
specific
provision
for
substantial
--
for
the
substantial
evidence
rule.
there
are
other
very
specific
provisions
which
the
court
considered
in
the
case
of
marcello
against
bonds.
the
burden
of
proof
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
not
as
to
exclusion
mr.
chief
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
--
that
i
would
try
to
point
out.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
first,
i
would
like
to
say
that
probably
the
--
the
major
reason
why
we
are
in
favor
of
habeas
corpus
is
because
we
think
congress
very
deliberately
chose
that
method
in
the
1952
statute.
the
legislative
history
which
i
shall
try
to
go
to
in
a
minute
shows
very
clear
statements
particularly
by
senator
mccarran
in
opposing
amendments
which
would
provide
for
declaratory
review
of
exclusion
orders
objecting
to
that.
now,
as
the
court
will
recall
in
the
pedreiro
case,
the
--
that
she
was
on
the
other
foot
until
the
government
tried
to
explain
it
in
a
way.
there
were
certain
statements
by
senator
mccarran
and
congressman
walter
would
certainly
could
reasonably
interpreted
as
indicating
that
in
their
view,
declaratory
judgment
was
available
for
deportation
orders.
that
is
not
true
in
relation
to
exclusion.
we
think
that
the
--
there
are
no
statements
by
any
sponsor
in
congress.
we
find
those
statements
at
all
except
by
opponents
who
were
seeking
to
have
the
bill
amended
but
there
certainly
no
statements
by
any
sponsor
in
favor
of
declaratory
review
for
exclusion
orders.
there
are
specific
statements
which
are
discussed
in
our
brief
against
that
possession
saying
that
it
should
be
limited
as
it
was
before
to
habeas
corpus.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
well,
i
just
want
--
i'm
--i'm
going
on
to
that
mr.
justice
reed
because
i
want
to
state
that
from
the
--
from
our
point
of
view,
the
major
position
is
that
congress
laid
down
this
--
this
rule
and
i'm
going
on
to
the
--
to
the
practical
differences.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
those
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
courts
of
appeal
had
made
a
holding
as
to
declaratory
judgment
in
deportation
cases.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
not
in
exclusion
cases.
in
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
there
had
--
there
had
been
no
lower
court
of
appeals
holdings.
there
had
been
some
district
court
cases
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
holding
deportation
cases,
i
don't
recall
that
they
were
adverted.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
lower
court
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
they
were
not
known.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
they
were
unreported
and
they
were
very
scattered,
i
think
here
in
the
district
of
columbia.
this
case
may
perhaps
being
one
of
the
few.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
there
isn't
anything
in
the
reports
but
there
is
a
--
a
statement
by
senator
mccarran
which
we
find
very
explicit.
it's
printed
in
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
and
he
was
in
charge
of
the
bill.
and
senator
--
senator
morse
had
provided
--
proposed
an
amendment
that
every
person
aggrieved
by
an
adverse
order
in
exclusion
or
deportation
may
obtain
review
pursuant
to
the
declaratory
judgment
act.
and
senator
mccarran
arose
in
opposition
and
he
said
the
amendment
--
this
is
in
the
government's
brief
at
page
32
and
33,
the
amendment
would
accomplish
something
that
has
never
been
done
within
the
history
of
man
by
granting
a
right
of
review
to
every
person
aggrieved
by
an
adverse
order
in
exclusion
proceedings.
and
he
went
on
to
oppose
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
32
and
33.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
in
--
in
the
government's
brief.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
32
and
33.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it's
--
it's
my
paraphrase
of
the
opening
paragraph.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
perhaps
it
is
but
i
think
it
does
indicate
that
senator
mccarran
who
was
the
sponsor
of
the
bill
was
opposed
to
declaratory
review
for
exclusion.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
i
think
it's
--
that
senator
mccarran's
view
was
clear.
i'm
not
saying
that
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
perhaps
mr.
justice,
senator
mccarran
could
have
take
another
view
but
he
did
take
the
view
which
we
think
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
and
he
opposed
it
on
the
ground
that
it
would
grant
review
of
exclusion
orders.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
he
indicated
later
in
other
colloquies
that
there
had
review
by
habeas
corpus
which
would
continue.
but
if
i
may
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
we
think
not
mr.
chief
justice.
the
committee
report
just
says,
the
only
thing
that's
available
is
on
page
33
and
34
of
the
government's
brief
and
the
conference
report,
and
it
says
in
the
very
last
sentence
the
safeguard
of
judicial
procedure
is
afforded
the
alien
in
both
exclusion
and
deportation
cases.
and
we
think
that
that
is
perfectly
consistent
with
the
view
that
the
safeguard
of
judicial
procedures
afforded
the
alien
in
exclusion
cases
by
habeas
corpus
which
it
had
been
for
many
years
and
was
to
continue
under
the
statute.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but
it
has
not
even
as
to
declaratory
judgments.
and
at
--
at
this
point,
i
would
like
to
say
that
the
attorney
general's
proposal
though
it
does
suggest
declaratory
judgment
for
deportation
orders
does
not
make
the
same
suggestion
for
exclusion
but
--
but
confirms
what
we
believe
to
--
to
be
implicit
in
the
1952
act.
it
continues
habeas
corpus
for
exclusion.
i
might
also
suggest
before
i
answer
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question
that
the
permanent
commission,
the
commission
which
president
truman
appointed
after
the
passage
of
the
1952
statute.
in
its
report
recommended
declaratory
judgment
for
review
of
deportation
orders
but
it
did
not
recommend
declaratory
judgment
for
review
of
exclusion
orders.
it
said
as
far
as
it
could
tell
there
had
been
no
problem
with
--
with
the
--
the
commission
is
not
aware
that
the
form
of
the
remedy
that
is
habeas
corpus
has
caught
any
real
difficulty
with
respect
to
exclusion
and
it
recommended
that
it
be
continued
as
it
believed
to
been
embodied
in
the
1952
statute.
we're
getting
back
to
what
mr.
justice
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
pardon
me?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
he
does
today
because
there
are
special
statutes
that
are
--
that
are
in
existence.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
if
a
--
if
a
native
born
american
citizen
from
outside
the
country
comes
in
as
an
excluded,
i
think
under
the
--
under
the
--
the
statute
as
it
now
exist,
he
must
seek
--
he
must
seek
review
by
habeas
corpus
on
the
360,
under
the
statute
as
it's
now
worded.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
one
of
the
practical
consequences
is
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
the
difference
is
that
exclusion
ordinarily
not
always
but
ordinarily
involves
a
person
who
has
not
yet
become
a
part
of
the
american
community
just
as
tom
we
shung
here.
he
was
seeking
to
come
to
this
country
because
he
was
the
son
of
an
american
citizen
and
the
war
brides
act
gave
him
a
special
non-quota
privilege
to
come
in.
he
had
not
become
part
of
the
american
community.
he
had
never
been
in
the
united
states.
so
there
is
no
disruption
as
there
was
--
as
there
is
in
--
in
connection
with
deportation.
and
as
the
court
mentioned
in
--
in
your
opinion
for
the
court
in
the
pedreiro
case,
there
is
no
disruption
of
--
of
the
alien's
life
in
the
country
by
requiring
him
to
seek
his
review
by
habeas
corpus.
he's
outside
the
country.
in
fact
--
unless
parole
is
granted
by
the
immigration
authorities
as
it
was
granted
to
the
respondent
in
this
case.
he
must
bring
his
declaratory
judgment
action
from
outside
the
country
and
--
so
he
never
enters
the
country
and
that
is
in
its
sense
another
difference.
there
were
last
year
a
160,000
aliens
who
were
not
admitted,
who
were
refused
admission
to
this
country.
most
of
them
did
not
have
formal
hearings.
i
think
they're
only
about
between
four
and
two
--
4,000
formal
hearings.
most
of
them
came
to
the
borders
and
were
told
that
they
weren't
admissible
because
they
didn't
have
quota
of
documents
and
left.
now,
it
may
very
well
be
that
if
declaratory
judgment
is
instituted,
these
persons
can
go
to
montreal
or
to
cuba
or
back
to
another
country
and
institute
declaratory
judgment
probably
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
against
the
attorney
general
or
the
secretary
of
state.
now
in
that
case,
i
don't
want
to
say
that
the
flooding
of
the
courts
but
i
think
it's
a
fact
that
it
must
be
considered
that
today
in
order
to
seek
review,
you
have
to
submit
to
--
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
immigration
authorities
and
bring
habeas
corpus.
people
who
are
unwilling
to
do
that,
who
would
seek
admission
to
the
country
can
bring
declaratory
judgment
if
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
is
sustained.
and
if
i
may
trespass
on
the
court
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
--
it's
a
--
it's
a
technical
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
he
is
--
he
--
it's
--
its
also
a
technical
jail
because
the
immigration
act
of
1952
gives
the
attorney
general
the
right
to
grant
parole
under
section
212
(d)
(5)
and
that
has
been
done
in
the
past
and
was
done
in
this
particular
case.
so
as
the
court
knows
by
going
back
through
the
--
the
decisions,
all
you
need
for
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction
is
the
hand
of
the
immigration
authority
and
then
parole
can
be
granted
or
the
court
can
grant
judicial
bail
as
it
--
as
done
in
many
--
in
many
times.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
he
is
--
in
custody
if
he
arrives
at
the
seaports
or
at
the
airport.
he
is
not
in
custody
if
he
arrives
at
a
land
border
because
ordinarily
they
merely
say
to
them,
you
are
not
admissible,
go
back
to
canada
or
go
back
to
mexico
city.
and
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
the
difference
is
slighter
there
but
i
will
point
out
first
that
this
is
not
such
a
case.
this
is
a
case
of
an
entering
immigrant.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
as
--
as
for
one
who's
been
living
in
the
country
and
then
goes
abroad,
congress
has
made
the
distinction
and
this
court
has
upheld
it
that
as
congress
has
said
that
on
reentry
they
shall
be
treated
as
an
immigrant
for
entering
the
country.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
practical
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
it
would
depend
upon
the
--
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
there
would
be
no
practical
difference
as
then
except
for
this
that
a
man
--
that
the
man
by
going
abroad
would
have
indicated
and
going
abroad
in
the
knowledge
that
he
might
be
excluded
on
coming
back
would
have
indicated
that
unless
he
have
to
go
abroad
for
some
emergent
or
overpowering
reason
that
he
was
willing
to
take
the
chance
which
doesn't
occur
in
deportation
when
the
man
is
still
living
in
the
country
and
so
on.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
pardon
me?
that's
no
difference
in
the
consequence
to
his
family
or
--
or
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
or
to
him.
that's
true.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
--
i
was
trying
to
point
out
that
the
differences
in
review
between
habeas
corpus
and
declaratory
judgment
are
first
and
i
will
assume
this
for
your
question
mr.
justice,
the
scope
of
review.
we
think
there
is
a
different
scope
of
review.
assuming
that
there
is
the
same
scope
of
review,
the
difference
is
the
one,
the
speed
of
--
of
litigation
which
is
important
and
which
the
court
had
stressed
in
relation
to
litigation.
i'm
in
relation
to
exclusion
and
which
the
congress
took
some
note
off
in
the
statute.
the
third
is
that
there
is
no
disruption
of
--
of
--
except
in
the
case
which
mr.
justice
black
mentioned.
there
is
no
disruption
of
the
home
life
of
the
alien
seeking
admission
as
there
is
in
relation
to
deportation,
a
way
the
argument
which
the
court
accepted
in
pedreiro.
the
fourth
is
what
--
that
it
may
very
well
be
that
aliens
who
are
outside
the
country
and
are
seeking
--
who
now
go
back
without
seeking
review
may
seek
review
by
bringing
declaratory
judgment
probably
in
the
district
of
columbia
because
that's
the
only
place
that
would
have
a
venue.
where
is
now
they
can
do
it
by
seeking
custody
mr.
justice
harlan,
but
it
is
a
technical
custody
in
--
in
--
as
mr.
justice
clark
pointed
out
in
those
cases
where
they
come
from
the
seaport,
they
are
already
in
custody
because
all
aliens
coming
into
the
country
who
haven't
yet
been
admitted
are
--
are
in
custody,
so
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
would
have
to
be
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
would
have
to
be
brought
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
that
has
--
a
question
not
yet
been
decided.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but
if
an
alien
goes
back
to
montreal,
he
presents
himself
at
st.albans,
vermont
and
goes
back
to
montreal.
never
having
been
held
in
custody
there
merely
told
by
immigration
inspector
there
that
you
are
--
can't
enter
because
you
don't
have
a
quota
number.
i
don't
know
but
i
think
the
safest
place
to
bring
the
action
would
be
in
the
district
of
columbia
because
there
would
be
no
problem
with
venue.
i
--
i
don't
want
to
say
that
that
would
necessarily
be
so
but
that
--
that
would
be
a
problem.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
total
custody?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
technical
custody
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
it
just
that
he's
in
--
they
are
in
the
custody
of
the
--
of
the
immigration
officials
and
then
habeas
corpus
can
be
brought
immediately
in
the
district
court
for
vermont
for
instance.
the
minute
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
ten
--
pardon
me?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
that's
all
that's
necessary
and
that
is
all
that
is
done.
if
i
may
again
add
something
because
i'm
quite
sure
that
the
respondent
may
mention
it?
if
an
alien
seeking
entry
into
the
country
at
a
land
border
desires
to
test
his
exclusion
by
habeas
corpus,
he
will
be
taken
into
custody
to
permit
him
to
bring
habeas
corpus.
the
commission
of
immigration
and
authorization
has
so
ruled.
this
is
not
a
new
practice.
it
hasn't
been
followed
always
but
it
is
not
a
new
practice.
and
the
case
of
polymeris
against
trudell
in
284
u.s.279
which
is
a
justice
holmes
decision,
it
was
a
case
of
a
woman
and
her
daughter,
greek
citizens,
who
came
to
the
united
states,
reentered
the
united
states
from
montreal.
they
came
to
st.albans,
a
land
port
where
they're
taken
into
custody.
it
is
a
habeas
corpus
case.
and
it
is
the
policy
of
the
immigration
service
to
continue
this
practice
when
an
alien
at
a
land
border
indicates
that
he
desires
to
test
his
exclusion
judicially.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
think
it
is
a
right
of
review
by
exclusion
mr.
justice
harlan,
but
he
is
entitled
to
test
his
--
his
right.
if
he
thinks
he
has
a
right
to
enter
the
--
the
country,
he
has
a
right
to
say
it
to
the
immigration
authorities.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it's
been
done
for
all
these
years.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
it
was
done
before
that
and
i
think
it's
been
done
since.
it
hasn't
always
been
followed.
i
don't
want
to
give
you
the
expression
that's
always
been
followed
but
it
has
been
done.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
about
a
hundred
in
--
hundreds
in
--
in
the
fiscal
year
ended
1956,
168,811
aliens
were
refused
admission.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
how
many
deportation
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
deportation
as
distinct
from
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
have
that
mr.
justice,
i'll
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
well,
i
also
--
i
looked
up
in
the
report
of
the
(inaudible)
commission
that
gives
the
figures
for
1949
to
1950
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
on
deportation.
i
would
give
it
--
them
to
you,
so
it'll
give
you
some
idea
of
the
scale.
and
in
the
year
1949,
there
were
20,000.
in
the
year
1950,
there
were
6600.
in
the
year
1951,
there
were
13,544.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
possibly
it
is
but
i
would
supply
that
later
figures
to
you.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
can't
conceive
of
any
mr.
chief
justice
for
this
reason
that
in
order
to
enter
the
country
you
have
to
come
to
the
gates
of
the
country.
once
you're
at
the
gates
of
the
country
whether
it
would
be
at
a
seaport
or
an
airport
or
at
the
land
borders
as
i
mentioned
a
few
minutes
ago,
you
can
be
taking
in
to
custody
and
so
you
will
be
able
to
secure
your
judicial
review
by
habeas
corpus.
i
can't
conceive
of
any
situation
where
an
alien
seeking
to
enter
the
country
could
not
get
review
just
as
a
--
a
citizen
claimant.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
i
think
i
did.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
i
did.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
that's
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
one
thing
that
congress
is
always
been
dead
set
against
if
i
may
use
the
cloak
of
expression.
they
didn't
want
review
of
a
consulate
determination
that
so
and
so
was
not
granted
a
quota.
that
is
clear
in
the
legislative
history,
both
on
the
part
of
senator
mccarran.
and
i
believe
though
my
memory
may
fail
me
on
the
part
of
congressman
walter
and
the
others.
i
think
one
of
the
threads
that
runs
through
the
1952
statute
of
the
legislative
history
is
that
they
did
not
want
a
person
in
a
foreign
country
who
never
came
to
the
gates
of
the
country
to
be
able
to
get
review
of
a
consular
refusal
or
refusal
by
a
letter
from
the
attorney
general
or
something
like
that.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
