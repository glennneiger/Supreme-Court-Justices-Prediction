justice
frankfurter
may
i
ask
mr.
blow,
whether
on
your
second
point,
the
jury
didn't
bring
in
a
conviction
for
asking
but
you
say
that
was
necessarily
included
in
their
finding
of
guilt
by
way
of
arson?
justice
frankfurter
why
do
you
say
that?
the
--
justice
frankfurter
the
charge
of
murder
was
before
the
jury
in
view
of
the
fact
that
you
motion
was
denied?
justice
frankfurter
the
--
the
charge
for
murder
was
before
the
jury
since
your
motion
to
dismiss
--
that
found,
as
i
understood
you,
was
denied
at
the
second
trial.
justice
frankfurter
did
they
return
any
verdict
on
the
murder
charge?
justice
frankfurter
as
the
implication
was
they
must
have
found
him
not
guilty
of
--
of
--
justice
frankfurter
that's
right.
justice
frankfurter
but
he
--
therefore
--
justice
frankfurter
mr.
blow,
you
--
you
emphasized
the
fact
there
were
only
four
judges
in
the
trono
case
rightly
enough
facing
down
the
fact
that
mr.
justice
holmes
concurred
in
the
result?
justice
frankfurter
i
take
it
--
i
know
no
more
about
it
than
you
do
but
i
take
it
he
concurred
in
the
result
because
in
--
the
peckham
opinion
didn't
go
far
enough.
justice
frankfurter
the
view
of
the
dissent
in
kepner.
justice
frankfurter
he
would
--
he
would
go
way
beyond
what
was
decided
in
trono.
justice
frankfurter
i
suggest
therefore,
the
opinion
in
trono
is
not
four
--
but
four
--
more
than
five.
justice
frankfurter
well,
that's
because
he
had
a
totally
different
--
justice
frankfurter
he
has
prejudice
in
favor
of
clear
analysis
instead
of
phrases.
justice
frankfurter
what
i'm
suggesting
is,
that
you
can't
head
on
the
fact
that
justice
peckham's
opinion
was
concurred
and
only
by
three
others.
justice
frankfurter
yes.
justice
frankfurter
well,
that
was
ex
post
facto
--
justice
frankfurter
--
cases
of
ex
post
facto.
justice
frankfurter
what
is
the
present
--
what
is
the
english
law
on
that,
mr.
blow?
justice
frankfurter
i
suppose
the
--
i
should
have
answered
myself.
in
case
of
reversal,
he
goes
free
anyhow
under
the
criminal
appeals
act.
there's
no
--
no
new
trial.
if
the
verdict
appealed
from
is
infected
with
error,
that's
an
end
of
the
matter.
justice
frankfurter
i
was
wondering
whether
--
i
was
wondering
whether
in
england,
where
the
case
have
arisen,
where
a
man
is
convicted
of
a
lesser
offense,
he
appeals
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
they
just
--
they
--
they
sustained
the
appeal
that
as
they
can't
be
retried
for
the
lesser
offense.
could
he
be
retired
for
murders
in
this
case
as
should?
justice
frankfurter
then
you're
second
was
a
subject
to
operation,
i
think.
justice
frankfurter
of
course,
waived
--
i've
--
am
i
right?
the
story
doubted
whether
you
could
waive
even
for
purpose
of
appeal,
isn't
it?
justice
frankfurter
and
yet,
be
overruled
by
this
court,
isn't
that
right?
justice
frankfurter
can
you
--
can
you
really
say,
as
a
matter
of
--
of
--
what
shall
i
say
correct
or
valid
interpretation
of
what
a
jury
does
when
it
doesn't
bring
in
a
conviction
and
doesn't
bring
in
an
acquittal
in
terms
--
justice
frankfurter
--
and
to
talk
that
they've
practically
or
inferentially
acquitted
him
very
unreal?
justice
frankfurter
yes.
justice
frankfurter
it
wouldn't
be
the
only
argument
of
the
government
that
i
do
not
accept.
all
i'm
saying
is,
that
when
a
jury
brings
in
--
doesn't
find
guilt
or
acquit
but
brings
in
a
verdict
of
a
different
kind.
the
practical
fact
is
that
for
reasons
that
are
not
disclosed,
they
reached
that
verdict
which
they
express.
justice
frankfurter
and
we
don't
know
what
went
on
in
the
jury
room.
justice
frankfurter
non
constat
at
the
arson.
if
they
had
known
the
arson
verdict
would
have
been
reversed,
they
might
have
brought
in
a
murder
verdict.
justice
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
frankfurter
but
--
but
we
know
that
that's
what
a
jury
is
for,
to
make
a
human
conscientious
judgment
within
the
limits
that
are
allowed
for
them.
justice
frankfurter
yes.
justice
frankfurter
i'm
merely
suggesting
that
you
cannot
say
except
for
the
purposes
of
theoretical
argument
that
there
is
an
implied
acquittal.
justice
frankfurter
is
the
inference
or
the
suggestion
or
the
implication
of
what
you
have
said
that
assuming
the
most
benevolent,
a
non
coercive
purposes
on
the
part
of
the
police
and
that
they
couldn't
arraign
him.
it
was
there
duty
to
abstain
entirely
from
questioning
him.
justice
frankfurter
what
is
--
justice
frankfurter
it
might
have
been
this
case
--
justice
frankfurter
but
you
say
that
is
necessary.
they
just
said,
there'll
be
a
man
--
justice
frankfurter
--
or
they
said
for
this
man."
we
want
to
ask
you
some
questions
provided
you're
ready
to
answer.
you're
under
no
obligation
whatever.
you
don't
have
to
open
your
mouth
and
we
advise
you
that
if
you
wanted
send
for
a
lawyer
and
we'll
--
we'll
get
word
to
him
to
come
here.
justice
frankfurter
mr.
sand,
suppose
--
suppose
the
law,
as
declared
by
this
court,
at
the
time
that
appeal
was
taken
was
that
under
a
new
trial,
you
could
not
be
prosecuted
for
the
larger
offense
for
which
there
had
not
been
a
verdict
of
conviction.
suppose
there
had
been
determinations,
decision
of
this
court
without
any
manifestation
of
--
of
other
agreement
by
the
defendant.
would
such
a
--
and
supposing
the
most
solemn
form
an
appellant
in
the
court
of
appeals
said,
"i
want
your
honors
to
know
that
as
counsel
would
--
if
there
is
a
reversal
in
this
case,
my
time
client
with
fully
awareness
of
what
it
all
means
is
ready
to
be
tried
on
--
as
of
first
degree
murder."
would
that
present
a
difficulty?
justice
frankfurter
is
this
situation
--
justice
frankfurter
--
any
different
from
the
case
i
put?
justice
frankfurter
i'm
--
i'm
a
part
having
in
mind
a
half
against,
if
you
tried
even
though
the
death.
justice
frankfurter
no,
i'm
assuming
that
--
that
--
i
didn't
mean
to
inquire
that.
i'm
assuming
his
counsel
knew
that
so
far
as
--
as
the
law
itself
drew
any
conclusion
or
made
any
determination,
there
couldn't
be.
the
view
of
the
dissenters,
namely,
in
kepner
and
brought
this
to
his
view
was
the
law.
but
this
situation
is
a
new
one.
defendant
says,
"i
waived,"
that
whatever
you
call
it.
that
protection
which
i
have
if
there's
a
reversal
not
to
be
tried
for
the
larger
offense.
justice
frankfurter
that's
what
you
are
suggesting
and
you're
partly
asking
us
to
take
that
into
account
but
the
court
of
appeals
was
told
he
knew
if
there
was
a
reversal,
he'd
be
tried,
he
might
get
what
he'd
really
did
get,
a
conviction
for
murder.
justice
frankfurter
i
haven't
--
haven't
read
--
i
haven't
looked
at
either
brief.
is
that
in
you
brief,
this
colloquy
with
counsel,
is
this
counsel
in
court?
justice
frankfurter
like
to
what
--
like
to
what?
justice
frankfurter
or
that
--
or
that
here,
not
taking
an
appeal,
that
resulted
would
have
taken
place.
justice
frankfurter
if
you
had
to
give
a
theory
or
it's
your
position
having
rejected
it's
waiver
could
mean
unreal
way
of
looking
at
it.
he
wants
to
get
out
of
investigating
that
as
the
--
as
the
defendant
here.
and
what
you
say,
these
are
questions
of
law
--
of
law
to
determine
as
the
asked
question
is
arbitrary,
isn't
that
right?
but
what
is
the
theory
here
that
although
if
he
had
stood
--
stood
his
ground
have
taken
the
verdict
that
the
judge's
words
be
final.
when
he
doesn't
stand
his
ground
and
wants
to
get
a
review
but
then
all
of
it
is
opened
up
as
implied
that
you're
taking
justice
holmes'
opinion
on
the
(inaudible)
case,
or
is
this
a
special
case?
justice
frankfurter
what?
justice
frankfurter
but
i
wouldn't
be
able
to
reach
--
i
want
to
know
what
your
--
what
your
analysis
for
the
--
when
you
say
for
a
special
case
purpose.
what
--
what's
the
legal
--
what's
the
third
on
which
you
string
your
--
or
affirms
or
whatever
they
are?
justice
frankfurter
he
was
in
jeopardy
just
as
soon
as
that
jury
entered
the
--
was
--
was
sworn
to.
justice
frankfurter
and
became
a
jury,
wasn't
it?
at
that
moment,
jeopardy
--
he
received
the
jeopardy
of
the
court?
justice
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
frankfurter
well,
what
is
special
about
this?
you
have
to
generalize
this
and
say
that
if
in
fact
the
verdict
appealed
from
does
not
imply
the
--
is
not
in
fact
or
by
--
by
reasonable
implication
an
acquittal
for
the
larger
offense
for
which
he
is
convicted
at
the
second
trial
that
he
has
not
been
in
jeopardy
for
the
second
trial.
justice
frankfurter
that's
because
trono
went
on
a
theory
of
waiver
that
he'd
be
--
that
once
he
asked
relief,
correction
of
what
had
been
done
below,
he
can
say,
"i'll
stop
short
only
--
i'll
stop
short
at
any
point
where
it
might
bite
me
more."
that's
the
--
that's
the
theory
of
justice
peckham's
opinion,
isn't
it?
justice
frankfurter
what
do
you
say
to
the
fact
that
if
he
wants
to
part
from
the
view
that
an
appeal
by
a
defendant
necessarily
violates
the
literalness
of
double
jeopardy
provision.
it
does,
doesn't
it?
justice
frankfurter
therefore
--
well,
i
think
if
--
if
you
--
if
you
don't
stick
in
the
back
of
justice
story's
view,
then
isn't
it
necessarily
not
a
question
of
--
of
this
nicety
for
the
determination
of
the
considerations
of
--
of
whatever
you
call
it,
public
policies
or
blank
words,
the
consideration
by
which
you
--
by
which
this
court
should,
so
far
as
the
united
--
the
federal
courts
are
concerned
without
a
decent,
fair,
essentially
something
that
appeals
to
whatever
you
may
call
justice,
once
through,
gives
way.
justice
frankfurter
i
don't
--
justice
frankfurter
--
i
don't
think
you
can
read
trono
opinion
and
justice
holmes
special
relation
to
it
in
view
of
what
happened
in
kepner
and
say
this
is
a
special
doctrine
applicable
to
the
philippines.
justice
frankfurter
although
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
frankfurter
i
can
--
justice
frankfurter
--
although
i
think
as
the
board
is
quite
right
in
--
in
trying
to
restrict
it
to
what
was
peculiar
for
the
philippine
judiciary.
justice
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
to
force
on
your
certainly
--
certainly,
not
on
you,
suggestion
that
that
this
constitutes
a
violation.
justice
frankfurter
i
thought
he
was
whether
in
fact
once
you
grant
appeal
in
a
criminal
case,
you
do
not
make
a
breach
into
the
double
jeopardy
provision.
justice
frankfurter
that's
right,
i
knew
that.
justice
frankfurter
mr.
sand,
if
we're
going
to
construe
the
constitution
in
double
jeopardy,
did
you
collect
any
historical
materials
as
to
what
the
construction
was
of
double
jeopardy
when
the
fifth
amendment
was
adopted?
there
couldn't
be
much
like
in
england
in
this
kind
of
a
situation
because
there's
no
appeal.
there'll
only
be
a
new
trial.
i
mean
a
subsequent
different
trial
to
question
of
the
consequences
of
an
appeal
by
a
--
just
as
a
convicted
person
wouldn't
arrive,
wouldn't
have
originated
in
england,
will
do
anything
in
the
colony
to
ask
of
something
with
the
state
that
70
--
76
or
it
was
on
the
constitution.
are
there
any
materials?
justice
frankfurter
so,
you're
if
going
to
construe
the
authority
of
historic
content,
we
--
we
better
find
out
what
it
was.
justice
frankfurter
1905,
did
you
recognize
the
--
the
historical
approach
to
what
it
was
in
1793
and
--
justice
frankfurter
a
new
trial.
justice
frankfurter
an
independent
second
trial.
that's
all
you
can
say
about
it
historically.
justice
frankfurter
you're
saying
that
under
the
federal
rule,
the
same
physical
occurrence,
same
exertion
of
a
man's
fist
may
encompass
two
offenses,
the
very
same
transaction.
justice
frankfurter
and
conviction
for
one
doesn't
bar
conviction
for
the
other,
is
that
right?
justice
frankfurter
you
can
knock
down
a
post
--
a
postman
--
in
the
post
office
building
--
justice
frankfurter
--
and
prosecute
him
from
this,
that
the
jury
may
acquit
and
then
you
may
prosecute
him
for
interfering
with
the
mails.
justice
frankfurter
that's
a
classic
case
--
justice
frankfurter
--
from
the
federal
court.
justice
frankfurter
i
was
speaking
of
knocking
the
postman
down
in
the
new
york
post
office.
justice
frankfurter
your
meaning
--
justice
frankfurter
--
in
those
argument
as
i
followed
it
was
an
invocation
of
mcnabb.
namely,
that
the
postponed,
the
delay
arraignment
led
to
a
question
which
--
merely
because
of
the
delayed
arraign
--
delayed
arraignment
and
failure
to
tell
the
defendant,
that's
the
petitioner,
failure
to
advice
him
of
his
rights
constituted
the
kind
of
misbehavior
under
mcnabb
which
--
which
rendered
whatever
evidence
he
gave
inadmissible.
as
i
understood
it
that
was
mr.
blow's
case,
is
that
right?
justice
frankfurter
but
i
don't
care
what
--
justice
frankfurter
yes.
well,
i
--
i
wasn't
at
the
trial
--
justice
frankfurter
i
wasn't
at
the
trial,
what
i
heard
him
say
here.
now,
you
say
this
is
mitchell.
mitchell
was
a
dire
member.
you
correct,
me
i
haven't
read
it
for
ages,
but
sometimes.
mitchell
was
an
immediate,
almost
spontaneous
disclosure
by
an
arrested
person
and
thereafter,
he
was
detained.
thereafter,
he
was
not
arraigned
for,
i
think,
a
whole
week
because
the
argument
was
made,
the
old,
i
think,
taylor's
case,
the
journeyman's
case,
whatever
it
was,
trespass
ab
initio,
isn't
it?
justice
frankfurter
nice,
recognized
arguments,
we
said
no.
in
as
much
as
the
disclosure
wasn't
a
proof
of
the
delayed
arraignment,
it
didn't
vitiate
the
disclosure.
now,
what
--
you've
got
to
get
down
to
time,
how
promptly
after
arrest,
after
not
arrest,
whatever
it
was.
justice
frankfurter
did
the
trial
court
say
anything
about
dissenters,
in
his
charge
to
the
jury?
justice
frankfurter
but,
mr.
sand,
do
you
--
do
you
concede
that
uness
we
can
find,
just
provocation
for
this
argument
that
i
have
read
in
the
part
of
the
district
attorney
that
it
is
misconduct
and
it
would
warrant
a
new
trial.
justice
frankfurter
all
of
it,
was
it?
justice
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
to
--
justice
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
to
imply.
if
it's
long,
i
won't
read
it.
i
just
want
to
know
how
long
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
frankfurter
how
long
did
--
how
long
did
he
speak?
do
we
know?
justice
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
understand
unless
i'm
more
wrong
in
knowing
what's
persuasive
common-law.
this
situation
couldn't
have
arisen
(inaudible)
justice
frankfurter
--
in
what
--
in
what
--
could
it
have
originated
in
england
except
by
question
reserved?
justice
frankfurter
all
right.
then
come
to
this
country
as
we
got
cases
into
13
states,
found
about
1793
on
which
--
in
which
cases
in
which
this
problem
has
arisen.
justice
frankfurter
is
there
any
question
that
justice
holmes'
right,
this
was
merely
the
double
jeopardy,
directed
itself
to
a
new
independent
trial
of
a
prior
conviction
for
an
acquittal.
isn't
he
right
about
that?
justice
frankfurter
justice
holmes
said
that
double
jeopardy
prohibited
a
man
from
being
tried
after
he
was
convicted
or
after
he
was
convicted
for
the
same
thing
again
for
the
same
offense,
not
the
same
conduct,
isn't
that
correct?
isn't
that
all
the
history
tell
us,
so
if
you
got,
suprisingly
have
any?
justice
frankfurter
have
we
got
any
history.
we
haven't
got
any
history
of
a
conviction
on
a
indictment
partly
for
one
thing
and
another
thing
and
an
appeal
on
part
of
what
you
place
below
in
a
reversal
and
a
new
trial.
have
we
got
any
historical
period
at
all?
justice
frankfurter
contemporary
issue
--
justice
frankfurter
yes.
justice
frankfurter
the
what?
justice
frankfurter
i
didn't
understand
that.
justice
frankfurter
you
mean
district
courts?
justice
frankfurter
well,
all
--
justice
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this.
justice
frankfurter
many
of
these
courts
that
took
a
look.
can
they
--
do
they
refer
to
any
reports
contemporaneous
with
1793
to
which
i
can
go
upstairs
in
the
library
of
congress
and
read
it
for
myself.
have
you
found
any
such?
justice
frankfurter
but
that
is
so
tied
up
with
a
totally
different
system
of
criminal
proceeding.
justice
frankfurter
that
from
my
point
of
view,
it
sheds
no
light
at
all.
justice
frankfurter
mr.
blow
may
i
ask
you
just
this
question
just
as
practical
matter
that
from
your
point
of
view
the
court
of
appeals
having
found
the
charge
of
error,
it
could
then
have
directed
a
dismissal
of
the
indictment,
is
that
right?
justice
frankfurter
because
on
your
point
of
view
(inaudible),
he
couldn't
possibly
have
been
convicted
again
for
second
degree
and
trial
under
first
degree
was
foreclosed
the
only
alternative
rightly
was
for
them
to
direct
a
dismissal
of
indictment?
justice
frankfurter
i
don't
draw
an
inference
from
it,
i
just
don't
know.
justice
frankfurter
yes,
the
government
could
say
we
got
some
evidence
–
it
would
be
hard
to
say
on
the
state
of
this
record.
justice
frankfurter
never
mind.
justice
frankfurter
and
you
think
that's
a
stronger
case,
do
you?
justice
frankfurter
i'm
not
knowing
it,
i'm
just
(inaudible)
justice
frankfurter
i
don't
think
that
is
correct
mr.
blow.
justice
frankfurter
i
believe
that
is
not
a
correct
statement.
justice
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
that
the
lower
courts
shouldn't
indicate
that,
i'm
saying,
that
that
is
not
a
correct
statement
of
the
results
of
an
investigation
of
(inaudible)
justice
frankfurter
every
state?
justice
frankfurter
i
think
it
might
count
now
19
the
other
way,
16
your
way
and
13
had
no
(inaudible)
justice
frankfurter
mr.
blow
i
don't
want
to
lead
you
to
use
time
on
this
subject.
i
simply
state
myself,
i
do
not
think
this
question
could
be
determined
by
deciding
--
by
counting
the
number
of
states
one
way
or
the
other,
i'm
not
suggesting
they
could
be
relevant,
i'm
suggesting
that
if
there
is
anything
to
be
decided
by
that
and
if
your
figures
are
what
you
say
and
the
(inaudible)
my
statement,
then
all
i
can
say
is
that
it
wouldn't
be
the
first
time
two
different
lawyers
read
the
same
material
(inaudible)
justice
frankfurter
and
i
want
to
ask
one
more
thing
which
justice
whittaker
asked
you,
and
you
answered
yes,
that
a
necessary
inference
or
he
said
the
necessary
legal
consequence
and
i
suggest
those
are
two
very
different
things.
inference
means
what
may
rationally
follow
from
some
case,
a
legal
consequence
need
not
depend
on
that.
we
may
have
a
legal
consequence
without
it
being
a
necessary
factual
inference.
justice
frankfurter
and
i
didn't
mean
to
shut
you
off,
i
wasn't
arguing,
that
all
i
meant
to
say,
i
didn't
want
to
look
–
(inaudible)
anything
i
have
said
to
lead
you
to
make
a
use
of
your
time
that
you
otherwise
wouldn't
have
made.
justice
frankfurter
mr.
blow
if
you
are
going
to
examine
individual
statements
of
the
justices
in
kepner
and
trono
rather
than
it
takes
to
defeat
them
in
trono
what
the
court
had
cited
and
i
suggest
to
you
that
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
mckenna
dissented
in
trono
because
the
court
didn't
far
enough.
justice
frankfurter
so
they
dissented
in
kepner,
on
the
ground
that
double
jeopardy
doesn't
prevent
you
from
--
doesn't
prevent
even
the
government
from
appeal.
they
went
on
in
continuous
proceeding
stream.
i
don't
see
where
we
get
if
you
were
going
to
be
off
the
ground
because
he
dissented
unfairly
--
justice
frankfurter
but
why
did
mckenna
--
i
know
he
was
a
swing
man
but
why
did
mckenna
dissented,
it
may
fairly
be
said
because
the
court
didn't
go
far
enough
and
i
do
not
see
how
you
can
possibly
say
that
these
decisions
rested
on
any
question
of
spanish
law,
when
in
the
whole
of
the
opinion
there
isn't
a
reference
of
spanish
law
and
a
complete
(inaudible)
and
the
court
said,
we
must
decide
this
case
and
i
believe
rightly,
if
anyone
knows
the
whole
issue
that
is
front
of
these
governments
rightly,
follow
the
instructions
as
to
--
instruction,
they
have
been
giving
instructions
did
embrace
statutory
the
bill
of
rights
intended
to
be
operated
in
the
bill
of
rights
for
the
philippine,
and
that's
what
the
court
said
in
trono,
didn't
it?
justice
frankfurter
well
that's
--
justice
frankfurter
so
that
question
is
decided
in
other
case.
that
was
doe,
the
other
philippine
case.
i
am
suggesting
that
trono
and
kepner
cannot
possible
be
explained
on
the
grounds
that
they
were
deciding
according
to
the
spanish
law
instead
of
deciding
as
a
fit
they
were
deciding
the
provision
of
double
jeopardy
in
the
american,
our
constitution.
they
said
in
explicit
terms,
isn't
it?
justice
frankfurter
but
i
am
suggesting
to
you
and
i
urge
it,
why
mckenna
dissented
because
they
said
if
you
are
not
going
to
allow
this
to
the
government,
they
dissented
in
turn,
didn't
they
in
kepner
on
the
ground
that
the
construction
which
the
majority
placed
rounded
by
themselves
but
white
and
mckenna
joined
holmes
in
dissenting
because
in
kepner
the
majority
gave
what
they
thought
a
true
restrictive
meaning
of
the
constitutional
provision.
justice
frankfurter
has
the
case
--
question
come
up
ever?
justice
frankfurter
the
question
that's
just
been
put
to
you,
ever
come
up
except
in
trono?
justice
frankfurter
but
you
answered
the
question
and
i
am
asking
you
whether
the
question
to
which
you
said
no,
it's
never
come
up,
never
been
decided,
i'm
then
asking
you
has
that
question
ever
come
up?
justice
frankfurter
all
right
and
you
can't
say
no
to
the
answer.
justice
frankfurter
i
think
i
may
ask
–
i
also
apologize
if
i
misunderstood
the
question.
justice
black
question
was
has
this
court
ever
decided
whether
the
government
may
appeal,
(inaudible)
if
that
was
(inaudible)
whether
this
court
has
ever
decided
may
the
government
in
a
criminal
case
appeal
an
adverse
ruling
and
i
suggest
your
answer
should
be
yes,
the
government
have
decided
that,
this
court
have
decided
that
and
has
decided
it
very
clearly
that
the
government
cannot
appeal
and
nobody
has
ever
questioned
that,
you
were
to
get
(inaudible)
in
144
us
--
justice
frankfurter
i
follow
your
legal
argument
with
interest
and
anxiety
because
it
is
(inaudible),
difficult
question,
but
i
suggest
that
you
begin
to
speculate
what
juries
imply
or
do
not
imply
or
what
they
do
or
don't
do,
you
one
up
again
a
fixed
rule
of
this
court
that
no
matter
how
contradictory
finding
is,
verdicts
are
on
different
times,
this
court
will
pay
no
attention
to
that
unlike
the
english
court.
this
court
has
said
again
and
again
that
we
don't
care
how
contradictory,
how
irrationally
conflicting
verdicts
maybe
(inaudible)
different
times
because
nobody
can
pursue
the
mind
of
a
jury
and
know
why
they
did,
what
they
did.
justice
frankfurter
well
that
maybe
a
good
argument
that's
undesirable
but
that
is
not
logic
outcome,
the
denial
of
that
isn't
a
logical
compulsion,
that
if
he
has
been
tried,
that
if
he
has
been
tried
and
the
jury
brings
in
the
verdict
and
that
verdict
has
a
fatal
error
and
therefore
calls
for
reversal
or
nullification
of
that
verdict
to
a
sentence
under
it,
but
that's
an
end
of
the
matter,
that
means
it
maybe
an
undesirable
result
but
it
isn't
necessarily
in
conflict
with
reason,
because
that's
the
state
of
today's
english
law
as
you
well
know.
justice
frankfurter
i
agree
to
that,
other
way
around
it
isn't
compelled
--
the
contrary
is
also
not
compelled
by
reason.
justice
frankfurter
i
want
to
be
sure,
i,
i
mean
taking
chief
justice's
questions,
it
must
be
very
important,
i
want
to
be
sure
whether
i
understand,
that
you
understand
your
questions
you
(inaudible)
your
answers.
let
me
put
my
question,
out
it
in
my
language,
if
the
jury
having
been
charged
by
the
judge
in
a
way
that
enabled
(inaudible)
there,
suppose
the
judges
charge
under
this
indictment,
charges
the
defendants
with
murder
you
may
bring
in
a
verdict
of
conviction
or
acquittal
for
murder,
but
you
may
also
find
it
is
the
law
that
charges
that
under
this
indictment,
under
this
count
for
murder
it
includes
murder
in
the
second
degree
or
manslaughter
even
though
you
may
find
as
your
line
under
the
appropriate
charge
of
what
constitutes
premeditated
murder
in
the
district
of
columbia,
you
may
bring
in
a
verdict
of
manslaughter
or
murder
in
the
second
degree,
explicitly,
as
explicitly
as
i
have
tried
to
elicit.
have
i
put
my
question
clearly
so
i
could
then
–
i've
put
the
facts
so
i
can
then
answer
–
ask
my
question.
justice
frankfurter
the
jury
then
says
in
clear
and
unambiguous
words
(inaudible)
their
foreman;
we
are
all
agreed
in
finding
that
the
defendant
is
not
guilty
of
murder.
we
are
agreed
in
finding
that
he
is
innocent
of
charge
of
murder
but
we
find
that
the
defendant
is
guilty
of
manslaughter.
and
he
then
appeals
for
one
reason
or
another,
one
alleged
there
or
another
conviction,
a
sentence
following
the
verdict
for
manslaughter.
my
question
is
and
that
alleged
–
and
the
error
claimed
by
and
is
sustained
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
they
said
a
new
trial
must
be
granted,
may
the
government
then
prosecute
him
--
the
government
then
pursued
on
the
new
trial
of
charge
resulting
in
a
conviction
for
murder,
you
want
to
give
an
answer
to
that?
justice
frankfurter
are
you
on
behalf
of
the
government
admitting
that
if
a
jury
says
nothing
it
is
the
same
thing
as
when
he
says
something?
are
you
saying
that
a
jury
says
(inaudible)
that's
the
same,
that's
exactly
the
same
thing
as
when
they
say
nothing
about
it,
but
bring
in
a
verdict
for
a
lesser
offense,
is
that
what
you're
saying
for
the
government?
justice
frankfurter
may
i
state
--
justice
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
frankfurter
you
are
confused
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
suggestion.
justice
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
frankfurter
yes.
justice
frankfurter
let's
see
if
can
i
put
my
question
as
clearly
as
i
can
and
protect
your
innocence
(inaudible).
my
question
is
and
what
i
was
speaking
to
(inaudible)
chief
justice's
question
and
agree
with
it,
my
question
as
i
understand
that
his
question
(inaudible)
don't
give
an
answer
to
me
whatever
you
have
given
to
them,
don't
answer
on
the
basis
of
trono,
trono
doesn't
exist,
wipe
it
out
from
your
mind,
and
i'd
like
to
pursue
this
question.
are
you
on
behalf
of
a
government
claim
that
in
fact
in
human
experience,
in
the
experience
of
everybody
who
has
tried
cases,
when
a
jury
brings
in,
in
turn
a
verdict
saying
we
acquit
this
man
of
battery
with
malice
or
any
other
serious
offense,
grand
larceny,
we
acquit
him
of
grand
larceny,
you
send
him
to
jail
for
ten
years.
well
a
jury
comes
in
and
uses
those
explicit
words
of
determination
of
finding
of
acquittal.
is
that
in
your
view
not
legal
consequence,
i'm
not
now
talking
about
legal
consequence,
prepare
that
for
legal
consequences,
until
you
get
with
reality
first
with
experience,
with
what
takes
place
in
life.
i
want
know
whether
you
say
on
behalf
of
the
government
that
when
a
jury
says
we
acquit
him,
but
we
find
him
guilty
first
of
manslaughter
or
petty
larceny
that
that
is
the
same
thing
when
they
say
nothing
and
just
bring
in
a
verdict
for
the
lesser
offence,
are
you
saying
that
for
the
government?
justice
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
this
case,
i'm
talking
about
the
generality,
well
anybody
would
tried
cases,
who
is
saying
that
when
a
jury
says
we
acquit
that's
the
same
thing
as
when
they
say
nothing
but
just
give
the
verdict
for
a
lesser
offense.
i
suggest
before
you
answer
on
the
facts,
the
experience,
the
workings
of
the
mind
of
the
jury,
the
consequences,
of
what
that
means
in
fact,
not
legal
consequences,
i'm
not
taking
about
that
at
the
moment,
before
you
answer
that
affirmatively
you
got
to
consult
(inaudible)
whether
they
think
when
the
jury
says
nothing
it
means
the
opposite
to
this,
they
say
something.
justice
frankfurter
let's
--
let's
see
if
i
understand
you.
do
you
mean
to
say
if
--
if
the
indictment,
count
one
for
arson,
count
two
for
burglary,
count
three
for
murder
and
the
jury
brings
in
a
verdict,
we
find
the
defendant
guilty
of
count
one.
the
count
find
the
defendant
guilty
of
burglary
count
one.
i
think
that's
count
one.
say
nothing
about
the
other
two
that
chief
justice
called
blank
and
the
judge
accepts
that
verdict.
it
held
the
clerk
to
answer
that
verdict
and
then
thanks
to
jury
for
the
devoted
services
that
caters
me
and
they
go
away
and
then
enforces
the
sentence
of
x
years
for
burglar,
did
i
--
do
you
say
or
suggest
that
the
government
could
have
a
--
a
trial,
another
trial
for
murder
and
arson?
i'm
not
suggesting
an
appeal.
the
defendant
does
nothing.
his
--
he
and
his
counsel
are
very
happy
over
this
result
and
they
do
nothing,
could
the
u.s.
attorney
of
the
district
here
move
a
new
trial
for
arson
and
murder?
justice
frankfurter
well,
i
know.
justice
frankfurter
that's
for
the
hypothetical,
there's
something
that
doesn't
happen.
it
didn't
happen.
justice
frankfurter
well
--
justice
frankfurter
no.
that
isn't
what
i
said.
justice
frankfurter
why
can't
you
answer
a
simple
question?
they
--
they
say
nothing
about
two
and
three.
there's
nothing
and
they
say,
“we
find
the
defendant
guilty
on
count
one.”
and
the
judge
whether
he
does
or
doesn't
obey
the
federal
rules
or
knows
them
or
doesn't
know
them
held
the
clerk
to
enter
that
and
thanked
the
jury
who
send
them
home.
justice
frankfurter
can
the
u.s.
attorney
the
next
day
move
the
trial
on
counts
two
and
three?
justice
frankfurter
well,
the
answer
is
simply
no.
justice
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
frankfurter
but
that's
a
very
different
question
if
he
appeals
that
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
is
reversed.
justice
frankfurter
are
we
discussing
the
real
thing
when
we
talk
about
rape,
arson
and
burglary
all
put
in
one
account.
is
that
a
real
situation?
justice
frankfurter
well,
i
should
think
that
u.s.
attorney
ought
to
be
fired
quickly
from
that.
justice
frankfurter
but
isn't
the
--
the
hypothesis
was
just
one
count
we
hereby
charge
the
defendant
with
having
committed
rape,
arson
and
murder,
all
in
one
count
and
no
more.
justice
frankfurter
i
wasn't
talking
about
it.
i
don't
know
(inaudible)
on
this
point,
and
that's
conceivable
that
a
u.s.
attorney
would
do
that
or
the
judge
would
allow
it.
justice
frankfurter
justice
whittaker
--
justice
frankfurter
shouldn't
you
have
when
mr.
blow
pointed
out
on
his
argument,
namely
that
mr.
justice
brown
wanted
to
arrest
the
kepner
case
and
one
of
the
differences
is
between
the
philippines.
justice
frankfurter
may
i
suggest
to
you
and
to
mr.
blow
that
in
fact
--
in
fact,
that's
what
the
court
did
do
in
trono.
that's
what
it
did
do.
i
take
it
--
i
don't
know
more
than
you
do
from
reading
and
also
in
(inaudible).
i
take
it
that
mr.
justice
holmes
concurred
in
the
result,
because
he
wasn't
satisfied
with
the
clarity
of
the
theory
or
neither
he
have
indicated
the
confusion
of
the
theory
on
which
or
by
which
the
court
reached
the
result
and
that
explains
what
otherwise
is
inexplicable,
the
dissent
of
mr.
justice
mckenna
and
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
justice
mckenna
and
mr.
justice
white
in
kepner
agreed
with
justice
holmes'
dissent
on
the
continued
--
continue
on
the
proceedings
theory.
and
they
dissent
it
because
the
court
didn't
go
far
enough,
and
then
they
--
in
the
--
in
kepner
--
and
in
trono
they
dissented
because
they
said,
“well
if
you
didn't
go
that
far
and
(inaudible)
justice
frankfurter
yes,
but
i
think
the
majority
is
--
i
think
(voice
overlap)
the
court
in
--
in
kepner
--
in
trono.
otherwise,
we'll
run
into
the
difficulty
into
which
i
write,
not
on
purely
logical
ground,
but
on
other
consideration
of
equality
that
it
has
been
rightly
called,
that
although
you
bring
in
an
affirmative
acquittal
on
a
major
--
on
the
most
serious
crimes
and
if
the
defendant
appeals
on
the
minor
crime,
if
he
has
a
set
of
instruction,
he
himself
opened
it
up.
he
opened
up
the
whole
thing.
that's
the
point
and
that
was
the
essence
of
holmes'
dissent
in
kepner
which
the
court
didn't
take,
but
in
effect,
they
took
it
in
trono.
justice
frankfurter
mr.
sand,
there
was
a
decision
in
trono
wasn't
it?
the
fact
that
mr.
justice
holmes
just
concurred
into
his
own,
didn't
take
him
out
of
the
case,
did
it?
justice
frankfurter
there
was
a
decision
--
justice
frankfurter
--
the
four
went
to
the
extent
of
saying
that
although
a
man
was
acquitted
in
turn,
he
could
be
retried
to
the
thing
on
which
he
was
acquitted
in
terms
if
he
appealed
on
a
lower
grade
trial.
and
mr.
justice
holmes
said,
“i'm
a
whole
handler.
i
want
to
go
beyond
that.”
so,
that
doesn't
take
him
out
of
the
case.
i
think
it
puts
him
in
the
case
plus.
justice
frankfurter
what
about
stroud?
justice
frankfurter
what
about
stroud
mr.
--
specifically
said
that
under
any
view
of
the
constitution
--
justice
frankfurter
--
under
either
the
fifth
--
justice
frankfurter
what
about
stroud
mr.
sand?
justice
frankfurter
i
don't
think
you
stated
--
justice
frankfurter
--
the
essence
of
stroud,
mr.
sand,
if
i
may
say
so.
stroud
was
a
case
where
a
man
was
convicted
of
murder
and
because
--
and
the
government
confessed
error,
confessed
error
because
the
jury
was
in
charge
that
they
have
a
right
to
determine
whether
it
should
death
or
not,
because
the
government
confessed
error
improperly.
he
then
was
retried
and
the
jury
brought
in
a
verdict,
not
death
and
that
was
reversed
on
another
ground
and
then
he
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
death,
although
he
had
already
been
limited
to
punishment
without
death,
a
life
sentence.
and
so,
seriously,
the
government
deemed
a
failure
to
charge
in
the
original
that
they
confessed
error
and
then
he
was
sentenced
to
death.
justice
frankfurter
and
they
cited
kepner
in
there.
justice
frankfurter
trono
--
both
of
them
were
cited.
justice
frankfurter
what
did
you
ask
to
the
court
of
appeals
out
of
the
--
justice
frankfurter
i
suggest
to
mr.
blow.
i
don't
make
this
argumentatively.
i
think
your
position
really
necessitate
--
could
have
--
should
have
necessitated
the
court
of
appeals
in
dismissing
this
case.
justice
frankfurter
could
it
only
be
said
for
the
english
human
--
a
great
deal
of
sympathy
if
presumably
the
government
put
in
as
--
as
part
of
the
case,
at
least
i
should
like
to
--
i
think
it's
desirable
to
indulge
in
--
in
substance
so
far
as
it's
relevant
that
the
prosecutor
isn't
putting
on
a
preview
that
they
should
be
put
to
his
utmost
proof
at
the
first
chance?
justice
frankfurter
except
when
the
court
of
appeals
--
except
in
appellate
tribunal
makes
the
ruling
of
law.
i
mean
it
could
not
have
been
anticipated
or
the
government
state
its
evidence
on
this
rule
of
law
rather
than
that
whether
it
would
be
conscientious
and
able,
my
mind
as
a
prosecutor,
may
i
say
i
don't
think
this
is
the
theory
of
the
case.
but
the
appellate
court
thinks
otherwise
and
he
reshapes
his
evidence?
justice
frankfurter
but
that
isn't
this
case.
justice
frankfurter
but
i
put
it
to
you
that
something
which
is
done
by
a
statute
would
have
violated
the
constitution
as
being
an
ex
post
facto
law
is
a
pretty
serious
business
when
man
is
convicted
in
with
a
recommendation
of
life
and
the
denial
of
a
death
that
he
can
then
get
the
death
sentence.
that's
not
something
legalistic
as
it's
called,
is
it?
that's
pretty
serious
--
justice
frankfurter
no,
but
--
but
the
jury
is
entrusted
as
it
is
with
determining
his
sentence
and
in
some
states
as
--
on
those
recent
in
california,
there's
a
regular
hearing
before
the
jury,
a
separate
hearing
on
what
kind
of
statute
they
should
bring
in.
and
i
can't
imagine
a
bigger
difference
than
being
sentenced
to
death
and
not
being
sentenced
to
death.
justice
frankfurter
that
is
the
stroud
case.
justice
frankfurter
but
are
you
suggesting
that
the
stroud
case
knocks
the
waive
(inaudible)
justice
frankfurter
they
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
frankfurter
but
those
are
the
words
mr.
rublee,
the
fact
is
that
a
fellow
was
sentenced
for
life
and
therefore
he
was
negatively
as
possible
sentenced
not
to
die
and
then
he
takes
the
case
up
and
they
say
on
any
theory
of
waiver,
i
should
--
i
don't
see
how
one
can
escape
on
any
theory
or
waiver
and
say
we
waive
no
more
than
as
necessary.
it
is
to
have
a
new
trial.
he
is
not
to
have
a
fatal
punishment,
that
isn't
a
waiver.
i
don't
what
it
is
in
the
waiver.
i
agree
with
justice
holmes
that
waiver
is
nonsense
in
this
matter.
