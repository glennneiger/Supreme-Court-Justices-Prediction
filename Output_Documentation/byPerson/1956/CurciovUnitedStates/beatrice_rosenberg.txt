ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
let
me
first
clarify
the
procedure
here
and
explain
why
we
think
that
the
issue
that
we
say
is
here,
we
think
the
court
can
decide
here.
this
determines
the
petitioner
was
served
with
two
subpoenas,
a
personal
subpoena
and
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
to
him
as
secretary-treasurer
of
local
269.
and
it
was
served
on
april
9th,
this
may
be
turnable
to
10th,
but
because
the
counsel
wasn't
available,
it
was
put
off
until
the
12th.
now,
on
the
12th,
he
was
asked
a
lot
of
questions
not
only
in
his
capacity
as
secretary-treasurer,
not
only
in
relation
to
the
subpoena
duces
tecum
but
others
and
he
claimed
the
privilege
in
regard
to
most
of
it.
nothing
happened,
he
--
he
was
simply
told
to
come
back
on
the
17th
before
the
grand
jury.
and
when
he
came
back
on
the
17th,
the
only
questions
that
were
put
to
him
were
the
questions
that
are,
at
pages
6
to
7
of
our
brief.
they
are
the
only
questions
involved
in
this
proceeding.
those
were
the
only
questions
asked
of
him
on
april
17th
before
there's
been
any
request
to
the
court
for
a
ruling,
any
of
the
sort.
and
at
that
point,
the
court
looked
at
those
questions.
they
are
all,
all
15
of
them,
concerned
with
where
are
the
union
records
to
which
the
subpoena
duces
tecum
relates?
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no.
and
they
weren't
put
to
him.
as
to
the
other
200
or
on
april
12th,
there
was
no
request
for
a
ruling
by
the
court.
nothing
was
done.
he
was
simply
told
to
come
back.
then
when
he
came
back
on
the
17th,
these
15
questions
were
put
to
him.
he
refused
to
answer.
now,
some
of
these
had
been
put
to
him
back
in
the
12th,
some
had
--
and
was
mixed
in
with
the
other
things.
when
the
attorney
came
on
the
17th,
these
had
been
called
out
and
were
put
to
indirectly
and
they
all
related
to
these
records.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
they
were
--
he
had
been
--
let
me
say
this,
that
on
the
12th,
he
had
said
that
the
union
had
books
to
his
knowledge.
he
had
seen
them
and
they
weren't
in
his
possession
--
in
his
possession
at
the
time
that
the
subpoena
was
served
on
him.
but
he
claimed
the
privilege
as
to
whether
he
knew
who
had
possession
whether
they
were
in
his
custody
as
distinguished
from
possession
and
as
to
where
they
had
been
a
few
days
before.
so
that
--
as
i
say
that
happened
on
the
12th
and
he
did
admit
the
union
had
the
book
that
he
didn't
have
it
in
his
possession.
when
he
came
back
on
17th,
these
questions,
i
think,
can
fairly
be
said
to
try
to
reach
the
question
of
were
they
in
his
custody,
is
not
in
his
possession
or
did
he
know
where
they
were,
were
they
in
a
possession
of
the
union,
as
the
union
which
after
all
was
the
organization
who's
books
were
subpoenaed
and
he
was
the
officer
who
would
normally
have
charge
of
those
books.
well,
he
claimed
the
privilege
then
on
the
17th
and
it
was
at
that
point
that
the
grand
jury
reconvened
or
if
they
came
before
judge
noonan
for
a
ruling
on
the
question
and
it
was
at
that
point
that
they
read
only
these
15
questions
and
asked
for
a
ruling
from
the
judge
only
on
these
questions
relating
to
the
custody
in
control
of
the
union's
book.
the
united
states
attorney
made
no
attempt
to
put
anything
else
at
issue.
and
it
is
true
that
they
didn't
argue
with
in
exactly
the
same
fashion
that
we
intend
to
argue
here,
the
reason
why
he
had
no
privilege
with
regard
to
these
books.
they
talked
about
the
fact
that
he
didn't
make
a
showing
of
incrimination.
but
the
fact
is
that
the
only
question
on
which
a
ruling
was
sought
were
these
questions
about
the
union
book
and
that
was
what
the
judge
ruled
and
he
had
no
privilege
in
regard
to.
again
--
perhaps,
the
ruling
might
have
been
more
articulate
from
our
point
of
--
of
our
theory
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
at
pages
of
--
15
of
the
record.
he
said
--
and
i
will
just
have
to
read
it,
your
honor,
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
"all
the
ones
i
heard,
he's
now
read
to
me
seem
repetitions
and
certainly
the
ones
that
i
have
heard
have
been
properly
asked
and
should
be
answered.”
that's
15.
and
if
you
look
over
at
page
16,
the
fact
that
this
was
solely
confined
to
the
books
and
records
was
certainly
made
clear
to
everybody
because
at
page
16
of
the
record,
the
government
counsel
said,
where
it
says
mr.
wachtell,
"i
would
like
to
check
the
record
that
there
are
other
questions
not
pertaining
to
the
books
and
records,”
which
it
has
been
indicated
to
the
court
that
the
witness
did
not
answer
on
a
prior
proceeding.
the
government
might
feel
at
some
future
day
that
these
questions
are
probable,
so
that
everybody
knew
that
these
questions
were
combined
to
the
books
and
record,
all
that
--
which
i
say,
the
theory
wasn't
spelled
out
in
exactly
the
same
fashion.
i
hope
to
discuss
it
here.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
or
where
was
that.
that's
right
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
who
had
custody
and
control.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
it
was
the
subpoena
duces
tecum
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
without
adequate
excuse.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes,
your
honor.
he
was
asked
questions
that
would
tend
to
incriminate
him.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
and
the
issue
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
that
goes
that
our
petition
is
that
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
that
this
court
decided
that
in
the
white
case,
yes,
your
honor,
and
in
the
wilson
case
because
in
that
case,
in
both
those
cases
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
they
had
to
bring
the
book
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
even
though
the
book
would
show
that
they
had
committed
a
crime.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
there
is
one
holding
on
this
precise
issue
which
is
by
the
second
circuit,
in
the
field
case.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
this
court
has
not.
let
me
say,
however,
that
in
the
white
--
in
the
wilson
case,
the
defendant
who
was
told
to
bring
the
book
there
was
under
--
already
under
indictment.
two
indictments
had
been
returned
against
him
and
he
still
had
to
produce
the
books.
and
the
whole
rationale,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
the
corporate
book
--
the
corporate
books
or
the
union
books
are
something
separate
and
apart
from
the
right
of
the
individual.
now,
of
course,
whenever
we're
dealing
with
this
artificial
entity,
you
can't
actually
separate
the
entity
from
the
individual.
it
will
become
a
legal
question
of,
are
we
going
to
consider
the
entity
and
this
individual
merged
into
the
entity
and
forget
about
his
individuality
or
are
we
going
to
consider
the
individual
and
disregard
the
entity?
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
follows,
despite
the
fact
that
this
is
testimony
and
other
is
producing
books
seems
to
me
a
different
--
without
distinction
because
there's
no
question
about
the
fact.
it
goes
back
to
boyd
against
the
united
states.
that
is
their
--
the
privilege.
it
goes
to
the
book.
if
this
man
--
if
these
were
his
books,
he
couldn't
be
subpoenaed
or
at
least
he
could
claim
the
privilege
in
regard
to
showing
them
to
the
grand
jury.
and
he
certainly
couldn't
be
compelled
to
produce
them
at
a
criminal
trial.
that
would
violate
his
privilege.
so
that
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
the
question
of
whether
there
is
or
is
not
a
privilege
can
be
said
to
stem
from
the
fact
that
one
is
bringing
in
the
book
and
the
other
is
explaining
why
you
didn't
bring
them.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
--
maybe
so,
your
honor.
let
me
--
this
is
fairly
an
extreme
case,
but
let
me
be,
what
i
think
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
where
i
think
--
what
i
think
the
law
and
legitimately
is
which
is
that
it
seems
to
me
it
goes
as
far
as
the
union
duty
is.
now,
the
union
duty,
the
union,
the
owner
of
the
books,
his
duty
is
to
produce
the
books
or
to
give
an
adequate
excuse
for
nonproduction
under
rule
17.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well
--
but
i
say,
the
union's
duty
is
to
produce
the
books
or
give
an
adequate
excuse.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
relation
to
the
books,
the
personality
of
the
custodian
disappears.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
but
the
personality
could
be
sent
to
jail
in
the
white
case
on
the
basis
of
what
the
book
show.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
in
the
wilson
case
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
the
book
--
and
presumably
in
the
white
case,
the
book
that
he
was
compelled
to
produce
were
books
which
could
send
him
to
jail.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
these
were
all
before.
well,
no,
some
of
them
were
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes,
monday
was
the
day
that
he
was
subpoenaed
and
some
of
them
were
before
and
some
of
them
were
after.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
he
was
--
this
was
thursday.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
that's
right.
one
of
the
things
that
happened
was
that
they
repeated
the
days
at
the
latter
hearing.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
obstruction
--
if
he
--
obstruction
of
justice.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
think
--
by
the
way,
your
honor,
that
that
might
even
be
true
of
some
days
before
not
knowing
that.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
we
don't
argue
that
they
weren't
incriminating.
what
we
say
is
that
this
court
held
in
the
white
case
that
a
custodian
of
books
and
records
of
an
entity
doesn't
have
a
privilege
in
regard
to
those
books
and
records.
his
personal
privilege
even
of
those
books
and
records
implicate
him
in
a
crime.
in
the
grant
case
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
because
in
this
catastrophe,
he
happened
to
be
--
if
one
starts
with
the
--
with
the
premise
of
the
white
case
is
that
when
one
act
for
the
organization,
you
simply
have
to
disregard
the
individual.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
suppose
so,
yes.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
as
i
say
in
the
wilson
case,
i
don't
think
that
that's
really
any
different
from
the
situation
where
wilson
who
was
under
two
indictment
was
told
to
bring
books,
which
when
he
produced
them,
would
be
induced
evidence
against
him
at
this
indictment.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
now,
we
--
but
this
court
held
in
the
rogers
case
--
not
held,
i
should
qualify
that
suggestion
in
the
rogers
case
in
discussing
something
else
or
assumed
in
the
rogers
case
that
the
secretary
of
the
communist
party,
of
a
particular
local,
couldn't
refuse
to
produce
the
books
to
the
communist
party
because
they
weren't
her
books.
and
under
that,
the
mere
fact
of
the
production
in
that
case,
the
mere
fact
of
bringing
the
records
into
court
would
have
been
a
change
in
some
evidence
against
her
in
a
prosecution
for
--
smith
act
or
something
of
that
sort.
but
the
court
said
those
aren't
her
books.
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
if
somebody
else
had
those
books
and
they
--
we're
told
to
bring
them
in,
no
matter
how
it
--
no
matter
how
they
would
incriminate
the
petitioner,
they
would
be
brought
in
for
the
theory
of
the
corporate
or
association
books
as
been,
that
the
books
of
an
association
are
so
different
and
apart
from
the
individual
that
even
though
the
individual
was
the
one
whose
before
the
court,
we
have
to
considerate
it
as
something
different
that
the
entities
can't
act
except
through
individuals,
that's
true.
but
when
a
man
is
asking
for
a
union,
he
is
asking
at
something
different
from
what
he's
asking
for
himself.
and
on
that
theory,
it
is
the
union's
duty
to
account
for
the
books.
and
that's
theoretical
basis,
of
course,
it
has
certain
practical
effects.
now,
what
actually
happened
in
this
case,
of
course,
is
implicit.
in
the
record,
if
a
man
can
come
in,
a
custodian,
who
has
no
personal
privilege
in
regard
to
the
book,
can
come
in
and
merely
say,
“i
don't
have
them
in
my
possession.”
and
then
refuse
to
say,
“did
you
turn
them
over
to
anybody
else
in
the
union?”
then,
you
really
do
get
again
hard
to
see.
and
so,
you
just
pass
it
from
one
union
officer
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
to
another.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
think
so,
your
honor,
because
i
think
that
if
you
go
through
the
cases,
you'll
find
that
no
matter
how
much
the
court
--
with
great
weight,
the
court
has
given
to
the
privilege.
it
has
always
not
sure
of
allowing
constitutional
rights,
the
board's
amendment,
the
privilege,
that
same
type
of
being
used
as
an
affirmative
light.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
i
don't
think,
sir
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
except
in
connection
with
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
books
that
are
not
his
book.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
now,
that's
the
distinction
between
the
traub
case.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
but
they're
not
in
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
think,
your
honor,
that
this
court
so
held
in
the
wilson
case,
and
in
the
white
case
and
then
the
whole
string
of
cases.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
they
said
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
don't
see
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
that
that's
any
different.
he
is
compelled
to
bring
in
the
book
--
to
bring
in
books
that
might
show
that
he
committed
all
sorts
of
crime.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
all
right,
the
court
so
held
--
let
me
say
this
in
relation
to
the
sole
stockholder
of
a
corporation,
after
the
corporation
has
been
dissolved,
that's
grant
and
wheeler
in
226
u.s.
now,
i
don't
see
that
a
sole
stockholder
bringing
in
the
books,
which
show
that
he
committed
all
kinds
of
embezzlement
is
any
less
incriminating
himself,
then
the
man
is
--
we're
not
asking
to
incriminate
himself.
we're
only
--
all
that
he
has
been
told
to
do
is
to
bring
in
the
book.
if
he
has
a
reasonable
explanation
and
offer
why
he
can't
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
that
would
be
expected.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
the
alternative,
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
the
alternative
suggestion
is
we
punish
him
for
not
bringing
in
the
book
and
then
ask
him
to
come
forward
with
the
explanation.
it
seems
to
me
a
very
round
of
that
way
of
accomplishing
the
same
failure.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
he
wouldn't
have
to
testify.but
it
seems
to
me
that
under
the
cases,
once
the
books
are
in
existence,
once
he's
a
normal
custodian
to
those
books,
he
goes
to
jail,
unless
he
explain.
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
in
new
york
held.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
for
nonproduction.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
is
it
real
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i'm
not
melding
them.
i'm
saying
that's
the
alternative
open
to
the
government.
i
think
it
exists.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
in
new
york
had
held.
they
said
he
doesn't
have
to
answer
any
questions
about
the
books
but
he
goes
to
jail
for
nonproduction.
in
other
words,
you
--
you
go
to
jail
in
order
to
force
an
explanation
from
him.
it
seems
to
me,
more
honest,
more
--
definitely
accomplishing
the
purposes
of
the
grand
jury
to
say
these
aren't
your
books.
you're
here
only
insofar
as
you
represent
the
union.
now,
the
union's
duty
is
one
of
two
things,
not
just
one.
the
union's
duty
is
to
produce
the
books
no
matter
how
much
they
incriminate
you
personally.
your
duty
as
a
union
officer
is
to
produce
those
books
no
matter
how
much
they're
going
to
send
you
to
jail.
and
the
union's
duty
that
doesn't
produce
them
is
to
account
for
them.
and
if
--
as
you're
here
as
a
union
officer,
you've
got
to
carry
out
the
union's
duty.
and
the
union's
duty
is
to
account
for
the
book.
now,
once
you
account
for
the
books,
we're
through.
and
i
started
--
i
think
i
got
interrupted
when
i
started
saying
your
explanation
of
burning,
that
it
seems
to
me
that
you
showed
the
books
were
burned
that,
thereafter,
we
couldn't
ask
him.
were
they
burnt
in
your
direction?
were
they
burnt
before
or
after
the
subpoena?
as
soon
as
he
have
accounted
for
the
books,
we
agreed
that
we
are
through.
and
on
that
basis,
may
i
explain
what
i
saw
as
embezzlement
about
--
about
our
concession
in
regard
to
mootness.
the
judgment
here
with
six
months
in
jail
with
opportunity
to
encourage
himself
by
answering
these
questions.
what
we
said
was
we
can
see
that
these
we
have
the
right
to
ask
these
questions
only
to
the
extent
if
they
enable
us
to
get
the
books
that
this
court
said
we're
entitled
to
have,
the
union
books.
now,
we've
got
those
books
and
at
this
point,
with
the
books
in
our
hands,
if
he's
asking
question,
he's
got
a
personal
claim
of
privilege.
we
don't
deny
that.
we
say
he
doesn't
have
a
claim
of
privilege
so
long
as
the
union,
whom
he
represents,
hasn't
complied
with
its
duty.
now,
the
minute
the
union
complied
with
its
duty,
his
representative
duties
are
over
and
he's
an
individual.
and
so,
the
question
we
had
about
mootness
was
that
the
opportunity
to
purge
is
--
in
the
practical
sense
go.
and
the
question
was,
did
that
make
it
criminal
or
civil?
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
mr.
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
mr.
chief
justice
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
there's
a
very
curious
thing
about
these
books.
on
the
basis
of
that
segment,
i
ask
him
as
they
turn
it
specifically
and
he
tells
them
specifically
that
they
regard
the
subpoenas
and
had
to
have
him
--
he
didn't
--
complied
with.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
they
regard
the
books
in
their
hands
as
the
books
called
for
by
the
subpoena.
so
we
have
a
very
curious
situation
of
the
defendant
suggesting.
he
can
say
though
just
--
just
--
that
maybe
this
won't
the
same
books
that
subpoena
called
for.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
they
have
entries
afterwards.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
they
have
entries
afterwards.
as
i
say,
i
don't
know.
i
specifically
asked
the
united
states
attorney.
he
thinks
these
books
were
there
before.
they
had
very
sketchy
entry.
this
is
one
of
the
items,
one
of
the
questions
in
this
case
as
the
sort
of
paper
character
of
this
local.
so
the
books
were
very
sketchy
in
the
early
period
and
the
entries
were
more
careful
as
i
get
it
after
the
subpoena
--
after
this
conviction.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
we
had
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
we
had
never
contended
that
the
case
was
moot.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
we
--
if
the
subpoena
wasn't
complied
with,
we
don't
regard
it
as
any
question
of
mootness.
it
was
on
the
assumption
that
we
got
from
the
united
states
attorney
that
this
book,
that
these
questions
were
designed
to
get
had
gotten
into
his
hand
that
we
raise
the
question
of
mootness
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
because
the
whole
purpose
of
this
was
to
get
the
books.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
i
--
i
probably
haven't
been
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
haven't
been
accurate
to
him.
he
said
it
would
appear
at
this
time,
there
has
been
a
production
of
all
existing
books
and
records
of
local
269
demanded
in
either
of
the
two
subpoenas.
the
only
reason
i
just
want
to
say
so
definitely
is
that
presumably
they
may
know
some
books
the
united
states
attorney
doesn't
know.
the
united
states
attorney
thinks
he's
been
complying.
but
it
--
it's
their
suggestion
that
cuts
down
on
the
complaint
--
comply.
they
may
know
some
books
that
we
don't
know
about.
we
--
we
have
them
all.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
it's
our
view
that
it's
not
because
what
we
have
is
an
in
between
judgment.
the
rules
are
clear.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
the
reason
that
we
raised
the
issue
was
this.
we
concede
that
at
this
point,
these
questions
which
the
court
said
could
purge
the
contempt
are
in
a
different
posture
than
they
were
before
because
we
concede
that
the
only
--
we
could
ask
these
questions
only
insofar
as
they
were
auxiliary
to
getting
the
books.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
oh,
no.
if
the
case
were
moot,
we
would
agree
that
it
wouldn't
be
remanded
and
admit
if
the
case
were
moot.
if
the
--
if
this
had
been
a
civil
contempt
that
he
should
remain
in
jail
until
he
purged
himself,
it's
clear,
i
think,
that
it
would
be
moot
because
even
though
he
reluctantly
--
and
the
books
were
produced
reluctantly,
they
were
produced.
and
therefore,
the
whole
case
would
be
moot
ab
initio.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
on
the
other
hand
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
by
answering
the
question.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
though
different.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
he
wasn't
put
in
contempt
for
failure
to
produce
the
books.
the
government
didn't
conceive
it
that
way.
they
tried
to
get
a
ruling
that
he
should
tell
them
where
the
books
were,
instead
of
just
automatically
putting
him
in
jail
for
failure
to
produce
the
book.
and
the
--
on
that
basis,
the
only
thing
that
was
before
the
judge
was
a
question,
presumably,
preliminarily
because
if
the
defendant
had
disclosed
where
the
books
were
that
would
have
been
the
end
of
the
matter
and
it
wouldn't
have
been
unnecessary
to
proceed
with
the
jail
sentence
for
failure
to
produce
the
book.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
oh,
there's
a
certificate
of
contempt.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
at
page
43
to
45
of
the
record.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
and
there's
an
order
at
page
41
to
42.
the
--
the
contempt
is
--
the
actual
wording
of
the
sentence
is
at
page
42,
“held
him
close
confinement
for
a
period
of
six
months
and
that
he
may
purge
himself
of
that
contempt
by
appearing
before
the
united
states
grand
jury
in
answering
questions
in
direct.”
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
failure
to
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
answer
the
questions
that
are
set
forth
in
the
certificate
of
contempt.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
on
pages
44
to
45.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
42
was
the
sentence
and
43
to
45
are
the
certificate
of
contempt,
43.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
on
this
question
of
mootness,
this
is
--
we
have
an
in
between
situation.
if
he
had
simply
been
punished
for
refusing
to
answer
the
question,
that
would
have
been
a
strict
criminal
contempt
and
there's
no
question
about
the
fact
that
it
would
survive
no
matter
what
happened
later
on
to
that
book.
if
this
had
been
a
civil
case
where
it
was
purely
remedial
and
the
judges
said
you'll
stay
in
jail
until
you
answer
the
questions,
then
the
purpose
of
these
questions
is
to
get
the
book.
once
the
book
got
there,
we
would
agree
the
case
became
moot.
now,
the
reason
we
filed
the
memorandum
bringing
them
back
to
the
attention
of
the
court
is
that
this
is
sort
of
in
between
the
two.
it's
criminal
and
that
then
that
he
is
being
punished
for
failing
to
answer.
but
the
judge
did
give
it
a
remedial
term
by
saying,
“well,
i'll
cut
down
your
sentence
if
you
answer
the
questions
that
will
help
us
get
the
book.”
when
we
went
into
this
matter
further,
we
decided
that
under
the
authority
and
particularly,
the
decision
of
this
court
in
grant
against
the
united
states
in
227
u.s,
the
case
was
not
moot
because
the
court
had
said
that
even
though
you
have
an
opportunity
to
purge,
if
the
criminal
case
under
the
old
procedure
reviewable
by
writ
of
error.
and
therefore,
the
primary
derived
of
the
sentence
is
criminal.
on
that
basis
the
case
is
not
moot.
although
as
i
say,
we
do
admit
that
the
opportunity
to
purge
is
in
a
different
posture
to
this
court
since
the
government
does
have
the
book.
well,
basically,
that
is
the
government's
position
that
this
is
no
different
from
what
this
court
has
held
in
wilson
and
in
grant
and
in
wheeler
and
in
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
that
--
that's
the
way
the
question
came
up.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
(inaudible)
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
of
course,
in
both
those
cases.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that
was
the
fact.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i'm
going
to
say
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
but
they
--
there
was
this
--
an
additional
factual
difference.
then
in
both
of
those
cases,
they
admitted
that
they
had
the
book.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
oh,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
under
the
--
well,
the
recent
--
the
other
decision
by
this
court
and
the
lopiparo
case
in
the
eighth
circuit
that
the
government
could
have
proceeded
that
way.
it
seems
to
me
that
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
they
didn't.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
suppose
it
would
have
gone
back
and
forth.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
actually,
that's
right.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
we
--
as
i
say,
i
--
we
have
said
in
his
brief
and
--
and
we
don't
retract
in
position
that
if
there
is
a
personal
privilege
in
regard
to
this,
there's
--
there's
all
kinds
of
basis.
there's
a
basis
of
the
fact
that
after
all
if
the
government
found
the
book,
they'd
involve
him
and
not
only
in
the
prosecution
for
a
contempt
but
they
might
involve
him
in
all
the
offenses
that
the
book
would
show
too.
but
as
i
say,
there's
no
question
about
the
fact
that
in
wilson,
he
was
already
indicted
for
a
crime
and
the
books
were,
i
think
admittedly
wanted
--
well,
they
--
prior
the
same
investigation
in
any
case,
so
that
they
were
there.
and
it
seems
to
me
to
make
a
different
as
the
court
hadn't
really
recognized
in
other
situations
between
written
and
oral
testimony
that
is
--
the
fact
that
something
--
that
bringing
in
a
book
will
implicate
you
in
a
crime.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
essentially
different
from
the
fact
that
answering
a
question
will
implicate
you
in
a
crime.
the
real
question
is,
since
these
aren't
your
books,
then
they
belong
to
this
artificial
entity.
can
you
obey
the
duty
of
the
entity
simply
by
saying,
“oh,
but
this
is
going
to
implicate
me
personally.”
the
court
said
you
couldn't
do
it
even
though
those
books
might
involve
you
in
all
sorts
of
things.
it
held
that
you
couldn't
do
it
even
as
i
say
in
relation
to
a
sole
stockholder
of
the
dissolved
corporation
and
where
the
corporation
has
no
longer
had
existed.
the
only
person
interested
was
the
defendant.
that
was
in
grant
and
wheeler.
the
court
said,
nevertheless,
those
aren't
your
books
and
you've
got
to
produce
them.
so
that
i
don't
see
the
fact
that
this
is
oral
testimony,
if
so
can
--
makes
this
situation
that
different.
and
as
to
this
matter
about
proceeding
for
failure
to
produce
the
books,
it
just
seems
to
us
a
really
more
direct
recognition
of
the
custodian's
duty
to
say,
“no,
you're
a
custodian.
you
--
you
got
to
account
for
the
union
books
because
they
aren't
your
books.
they're
the
union's
book.”
then,
it
is
to
go
ahead
and
say,
“as
a
new
yorker
it
feels
he
did.
well,
you
can
claim
your
privilege
but
you
got
to
have
the
bounty
for
nonproduction.”
and
the
court
--
this
court's
wilson
case
is
clear.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
so
this
man
said
he
had
--
the
books
were
there.
the
books
were
in
the
union's
possession.
he
admitted
that.
they
were
in
the
possession
of
the
union.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
if
--
for
nonproduction.
no,
he
didn't
produce
them
and
--
well,
this
is
a
man
who
admits
that
the
union
has
book,
admit
that
the
union
has
book.
the
subpoenas
directed
to
him
as
treasurer
of
the
union.
the
union
was
supposed
to
bring
the
books.
now,
suppose
the
subpoena
had
gone,
instead
of
being
directed
to
joseph
curcio,
as
secretary-treasurer,
it
had
been
directed
to
local
269,
just
as
such
the
wilson
case,
it
was
addressed
to
the
corporation.
the
wilson
case
said
if
it's
addressed
to
the
corporation,
how
do
you
punish
the
corporation?
you
punish
the
person
who
represents
the
corporation.
who
taught
--
who
represents
the
corporation
in
relation
to
union
book?
the
secretary-treasurer,
so
that
in
a
sense,
a
ruling
contrary
to
the
proposition
here,
forces
us
to
go
against
the
man
to
put
him
in
jail,
instead
of
recognizing
that
as
a
custodian,
he's
in
a
different
position
than
as
an
individual.
and
at
the
minimum
what
he
has
to
do
is
at
least
account
for
the
books
in
relation
to
the
union.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
we
concede
so.
we
think
--
we
think
that
in
relation
to
the
union
book,
he
simply
doesn't
have
a
personal
privilege.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
whether
or
not
they've
been
subpoenaed.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
now,
if
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
pardon?
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
our
point
is
that
he
doesn't
have
the
privilege.
they
aren't
--
they
aren't
his
books
and
he
doesn't
have
the
privilege
in
regard
to
them.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
he
said
he
didn't
have
possession,
your
honor.
that
he
didn't
have
possession.
he
didn't
deny
that
the
union
had
possession.
and
he
certainly
didn't
--
he
certainly
didn't
--
it
wasn't
an
excuse
for
the
union.
that
wasn't
an
adequate
excuse.
he's
saying
he
didn't
have
possession.
under
this
court's
nilva
decision,
it's
clearly
wasn't
an
adequate
excuse
just
for
the
man
to
come
in
and
say,
the
union
is
not
producing
the
books
because
i,
individually,
don't
have
possession
at
this
moment.
so
that
it's
perfectly
true,
the
alternative
to
saying,
you
don't
have
to
answer
the
questions
here,
is
that
the
government
is
going
to
say,
“okay,
the
union
will
be
prosecuted
for
failure
to
produce
the
books
or
to
give
an
adequate
explanation.”
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
unless
there
were
adequate
excuses.
no,
i
don't
think
so.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that
is
--
no,
i
don't
think
necessarily.
if
he
said,
“oh,
i
don't
have
possession
of
the
books,
they
were
in
the
possession
of
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
that's
a
question
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
he's
prosecuted
for
a
failure
to
produce
without
adequate
excuse
that
he
is
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
without
adequate
excuse.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
no,
but
if
he
says,
i
didn't
have
possession.
they
were
given
to
our
accountant
and
he
was
out
of
town,
though
i
don't
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
oh,
i
suppose
one
can
bring
an
unsoundly
charge
but
the
prosecution
is
for
a
failure
to
produce
without
adequate
excuse.
it's
not
just
for
a
failure
to
produce.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
he
is.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
you
want
that
now?
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
of
course,
we
have
the
book.
it's
a
little
hard
to
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
suppose
theoretically
so.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
suppose
theoretically
so.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
that's
right.
they
are
separate
but
i'm
saying
that
in
a
sense,
i
don't
think
it
prosecute
this
generally
go
after
people
just
for
the
sake
of
putting
him
in
jail.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no.
but
i'm
saying
that
the
point
is
that
if
the
government
is
going
to
be
forced
to
go
after
these
people
in
contempt,
if
it
can't
get
a
ruling
that
when
somebody
doesn't
produce
books,
they
have
to
account
for
the
reason
why.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
they
have
to
account
for
the
reason
why,
there
will
be
less
in
necessity
for
prosecution
for
failure
to
produce.
and
i
don't
think
the
government
would
deliberately
go
after
(inaudible).
it
shows
this
vehicle.
it
will
be
asked
for
a
ruling.
it
said,
answer
these
questions
and
if
he
had
answered
them
and
the
books
have
been
produced,
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
prosecution.
theoretically,
there
was
a
right
to
it
but
as
a
practical
manner,
people
don't
bring
prosecutions
for
failure
to
produce
books
if
they
gotten
the
books
through
the
man's
testimony.
and
this
is
a
method
of
trying
to
see
that
a
--
the
subpoena
isn't
just
disregarded
by
a
kind
of
flimflam,
just
passing
it
from
one
member
of
the
union
to
another
without
having
to
do
with
it
by
starting
a
prosecution
for
contempt
for
failure
to
produce.
so
that
--
i
suppose
if
the
government
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
oh,
not
through
his
testimony.
they
got
the
books
because
--
through
an
impounding
order.
but
i'm
saying
that
if
they
had
gotten
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
oh,
no.
he
testified
that
he
has
produced
them
all.
and
then
they
had
reason
to
believe
that
they
weren't
true
and
then
they
were
impounded
and
found
in
the
nilva
case.
