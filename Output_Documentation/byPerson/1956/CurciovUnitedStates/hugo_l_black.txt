justice
hugo
l.
black
had
we
taken
that
action
before
the
court
of
appeals
originally
wrote
the
opinion
which
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
these
questions?
all
of
them
related
to
whether
something
had
happened
to
books
in
the
last
week,
is
it
not
or
were
they
had
been
taken.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
had
he
been
ordered
to
bring
those
books
the
week
before
he
failed
to
bring
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
he
failed
to
bring
them,
was
that
a
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
he
admitted
then
that
he
had
--
if
he
had
answered
these
questions
or
assuming
that
he
had
violated
the
law
and
failed
to
bring
them,
was
guilty
of
a
crime.
will
you
not
--
was
he
was
not
asked
questions
that
would
certainly
tend
to
incriminate
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
about
the
book.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
the
books,
custody
of
books.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
your
--
your
contention
is
that
even
though
it
would
tend
to
incriminate
him
because
this
was
about
the
custody
of
books,
he
nevertheless
could
be
compelled
to
incriminate
himself.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
if
--
wouldn't
that
be
the
result?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
they
had
to
bring
the
book?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
has
it
ever
been
held
so
far
that
a
person
who
might
be
under
suspicion
of
having
violated
the
law
and
subjected
himself
for
a
criminal
prosecution
failing
to
bring
those
books
could
be
compelled
to
incriminate
himself
about
him
and
confess
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
this
court
ever
held
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
personality
could
be
sent
to
jail
if
he
could
confess
he
is
guilty,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
didn't
try
to
prove
there
to
make
a
man
confess
a
crime
there,
did
he?
they
made
him
produce
some
books
and
that
was
the
(voice

of
the
judge
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
they
have
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
in
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
is
that
in
the
words
of
any
other
case
of
failing
to
answer
(voice
overlap)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
you
--
what
you're
saying
is
the
fact
that
the
fifth
amendment
says
that
no
witness
could
be
compelled
to
give
evidence
against
himself,
except
in
connection
of
the
charges
that
he
failed
to
produce
books.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
what
it
amounts
to.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
it
amounts
to.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
man
--
you
then
--
you
demanded
by
saying
that
no
person
should
be
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself,
except
in
connection
of
the
charge
that
he
failed
to
produce
books
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what
he
had
as
a
custodian
and
then
he
can
be
compelled
to
confess
his
guilt.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
he
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
he
doesn't
have
a
reasonable
explanation
to
make
him
tell
it,
what
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
you
ask
if
he
wouldn't
have
to
come
forward
then.
when
you
charged
him
with
it,
he
wouldn't
have
to
testify
if
he
wanted
to.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
--
that
wasn't
quite
all
in
new
york,
was
it?
they
proved
to
the
inference
that
he
has
failed
to
produce
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
you
haven't
prosecuted
him
for
that.
in
new
york,
what
they
did
i
assume
was
to
prosecute
a
man
for
failure
to
produce
the
books
and
proves
that
he
has
the
books,
deliberately
refused
to
produce,
wasn't
that
the
bases
of
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
we
--
i
thought
we
had
a
case
just
two
weeks
ago
where
the
government
did
prosecute
for
failure
to
produce
after
they
got
the
books?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
he
--
i
thought
he
justified
they
were
all
down
there
at
the
office
where
they
were
before.
that
government
sat
on
that
job.
