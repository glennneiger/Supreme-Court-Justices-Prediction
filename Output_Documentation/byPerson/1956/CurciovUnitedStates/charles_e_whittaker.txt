they
review
that
if
this
case
is
mooted
at
all
upon
the
ground
that
the
books
have
in
fact
been
produced?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
are
you
--
i'm
--
this
is
the
only
thing
i
understood
in
this
case.
does
the
government
concede
that
what
has
been
done
in
respect
to
these
books
constitutes
of
purge
to
this
defendant
on
the
sentence?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
then
you
(voice

--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
this
position
then
would
cut
the
defendant
off
the
pockets
and
deny
him
an
appeal,
perhaps
even
a
meritorious
one,
wouldn't
it?
if
we
followed
the
position
that
this
is
a
moot
case
now,
still
be
a

outstanding
against

whittaker
was
there
a

reason
to
prove
this
fact?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
does
he
waive
the
privilege
by
saying,
i
don't
have
the
books?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
of
course,
in
this
case,
he
did
before
the
grand
jury.
several
times
say,
he
did
not
have
the
books
at
the
time
he
was
served
with
the
subpoena
or
since.
now,
did
that
waive
his
privilege
as
against
prosecution
on
the
basis
that's
been
several
times
suggested
here
for
a
failure
to
obey
the
subpoena?
