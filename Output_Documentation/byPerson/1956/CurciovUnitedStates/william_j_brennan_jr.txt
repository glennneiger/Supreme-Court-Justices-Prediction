justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
ms.
rosenberg,
did
i
understand
you
to
answer
mr.
justice
black,
these
questions
where
or
any
of
all
of
these
records
a
week
ago
or
yesterday
monday,
where
or
any
of
all
of
those
records
a
week
ago,
saturday,
where
or
any
of
these
records
or
all
of
these
records
a
week
ago,
thursday
that
the
thursday,
saturday
and
monday
or
one
of
them
perhaps
was
a
day
upon
which
he'd
been
subpoenaed
to
produce
those
books?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
was
anyone
of
those
days,
a
day
upon
which
he'd
been
ordered
subpoenaed
or
otherwise
required
to
produce
books?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
he
was
under
some
order
of
some
kind
to
produce
on
one
or
more
of
those
days,
was
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
looking
at
page
7
of
the
questions
on
page
7.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
whatever
that
may
have
been,
was
anyone
or
more
those
days,
a
day
upon
which
he'd
been
under
order
to
produce
books?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
was
there
a
possibility
that
for
failure
to
produce
on
anyone
of
those
days,
he
might
be
prosecuted
for
a
crime?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right.
now,
that
be
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
speaking
of
these
particular
questions.
in
any
event
then
for
failure
to
have
produced
books
on
any
one
or
more
of
those
days,
there
was
a
possibility
of
prosecution
for
crime,
obstruction
of
the
justice
or
otherwise,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
how
can
possibly
--
the
government
argued
that
when
these
questions
were
asked
on
the
day
they
were
asked,
an
answer
didn't
lead
to
the
possible
confession
of
guilt
of
some
crime.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
it's
not
--
not
the
contents
of
the
books
or
--
or
records
that
i
thought
we
were
dealing
with
but
his
failure
here
to
produce
whatever
his
reason
may
have
been
for
not
producing,
on
any
of
those
days
exposed
him
to
the
possibility
of
prosecution
for
crime.
and
on
that
circumstance,
why
isn't
he
justified
at
asserting
the
privilege
against
answering
the
question,
where
were
they
on
thursday,
saturday
or
monday
because
if
he
admitted
that
he
knew,
he
contribute
to
the
government's
case
against
them
for
failure
to
have
produced
the
books
on
one
of
those
days.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
is
that
to
say
this
could
have
happened,
suppose
he'd
answered
one
of
these
questions,
where
were
the
--
any
of
these
records
or
all
of
these
records
that
we
can
go
thursday.
and
he
were
to
have
answered
that
having
--
fail
to
produce
them
on
that
week
ago,
thursday,
he
were
to
have
answered
it,
they
were
in
my
office.
could
the
government
then
have
indicted
him
for
failing
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
produce
the
records
a
week
ago,
thursday?
and
used
his
admission
that
they
were
in
his
office
on
that
day
and
he
knew
where
they
were
to
support
the
prosecution?
is
that
your
position?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
ms.
rosenberg,
isn't
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
nonproduction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
questions
in
answering
the
questions
about
the
books
(inaudible)
how
could
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
how
could
you
tell
the
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
ms.
rosenberg
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me,
ms.
rosenberg,
were
both
wilson
and
white
cases
of
prosecution
for
a
contempt
for
disobedience
of
the
subpoena
itself?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
mean
in
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
both
instances,
the
subpoena
was
to
produce
books
and
the
books
weren't
produce
and
then,
the
one
upon
whom
the
subpoena
was
serve
was
prosecuted
for
contempt
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
for
failure
to
produce
books.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
there's
at
least
this
fact
difference
that
the
government
didn't
pursue
that
course
in
this
instance.
i
suppose
you
could
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
that
was
the
fact.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
the
court
--
and
the
government
did
not
pursue
that
course
in
this
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
and
i
--
i
take
it.
you
didn't
pursue
--
or
the
government
didn't
pursue
that
course
here
because
they
could
not
approve
essential
to
a
prosecution
for
disobedience
of
the
subpoena.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right.
then
i
take
it,
it
did
not.
and
i
think
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
you
told
me
earlier
that
it
might
have
proceeded
that
way
as
a
prosecution
for
contempt
for
disobedience
of
the
subpoena
or
perhaps
by
a
prosecution
for
obstruction
of
justice.
in
other
words,
prosecution
of
the
offense
of
obstructing
justice.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
when
--
does
this
difference
then
when
we
get
to
the
day
when
judge
noonan
put
this
question,
“where
were
those
books
a
couple
of
weeks
ago?”
on
that
occasion,
when
those
questions
were
put,
they
are
hung
over
the
head
of
this
defendant,
the
possibility
being
prosecuted
for
a
crime.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
this
much
is
true,
isn't
it,
ms.
--
ms.
rosenberg?
if
he
had
answered
every
one
of
these
questions,
the
government
might
nevertheless
have
proceeded
and
prosecuted
him
for
having
failed
to
produce
the
goods
--
produce
the
books
so
we
could
sue
early.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we're
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
not
saying
that.
i
said
if
he
had
answered
every
one
of
the
questions
put
to
him
by
judge
noonan
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
which
could
go
out
--
here
me
out
a
moment,
which
go
out
of
the
fact
that
he
had
failed
to
refuse
to
produce
them
in
response
to
the
subpoena.
as
i
get
you,
he
could
have
been
prosecuted
for
having
failed
to
respond
to
the
subpoena.
and
if
that's
so,
could
he
not
have
been
prosecuted
whether
or
not
he
answered
these
questions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
whatever
he's
prosecuted
for,
he
could
have
been
prosecuted
for
not
having
produced
on
the
day
that
the
subpoena
required
him
to
produce,
is
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
without
adequate
excuse
or
otherwise.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
may
have
had
a
good
defense
but
he
could
still
have
been
prosecuted,
could
he
not?
maybe
the
government
couldn't
have
prosecuted
him
successfully
but
they
could
have
prosecuted
him
for
not
having
responded
to
the
subpoena.
you
told
me
that
twice
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
the
task,
the
right
to
know
(voice
