mr.
samuel
mezansky
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner,
the
secretary-treasurer
of
a
local
of
the
international
brotherhood
of
teamsters
was
adjudged
guilty
of
contempt
of
court
by
district
judge
noonan
of
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
the
contempt
arose
out
of
petitioner's
failure
to
obey
a
direction
of
district
judge
noonan
to
answer
certain
select
questions
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
the
books
and
records
of
the
local
union
in
a
grand
jury
investigation.
petitioner's
refusal
is
based
upon
the
ground
of
self-incrimination
and
his
privilege
to
remain
silent
under
the
provisions
of
the
fifth
amendment.
the
petitioner's
conduct
was
treated
as
a
contempt
committed
in
the
actual
presence
of
the
court.
and
the
petitioner
was
punished
summarily
and
sentenced
to
six
months
imprisonment
under
rule
42
--
42
(a)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
the
petitioner
was
given
the
right
to
purge
himself
of
the
contempt
by
appearing
before
the
grand
jury
and
answering
the
questions.
the
district
court
held
that
the
petitioner
did
not
sustain
the
burden
of
establishing
that
the
answers
to
the
selected
questions
would
incriminate
him.
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
order
of
district
judge
noonan
and
this
court
granted
certiorari.
the
questions
involved
upon
this
appeal
are,
first,
whether
it
was
evident
from
the
implications
of
the
questions
and
the
setting
in
which
they
were
asked
that
responsive
answers
to
the
questions
or
an
explanation
as
to
why
they
cannot
be
answered
would
be
dangerous
because
injurious
disclosure
would
result.
and
the
second
question
relates
to
the
procedure
for
--
in
the
hearing
before
district
judge
noonan.
the
petitioner
made
several
request
for
an
opportunity
to
prepare
a
defense
and
produce
witnesses.
he
made
several
request
for
a
complete
transcript
of
the
grand
jury
testimony.
mr.
samuel
mezansky
that
appears
now
for
the
first
time.
and
i'd
like
to
go
right
to
that.
yes,
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
samuel
mezansky
that's
correct.
on
page
35
of
the
government's
brief,
ninth
line
from
the
top,
the
statement
is
made
that
we
do
not
deny
in
this
court
that
if
petitioner
had
a
personal
claim
of
privilege
in
regard
to
such
questions,
the
possibility
of
incrimination
existed
under
the
rule
of
hoffman
against
united
states.
so
the
government
upon
this
appeal
takes
a
position
different
from
the
district
court
and
contrary
to
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
so
in
view
of
this
very
commendable
concession,
the
issue
presented
now
is
a
very
narrow
and
legal
one.
and
that
is
whether
the
custodian
of
the
records
of
a
union
may
refuse
on
the
ground
of
his
personal
privilege
to
answer
questions
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
the
union
books
which
have
not
been
produced
pursuant
to
the
subpoena.
as
i
stated,
this
was
not
the
ground
upon
which
the
petitioner
was
adjudged
guilty
of
contempt.
he
was
found
guilty
on
the
ground
that
he
did
not
sustain
the
burden
of
establishing
that
the
answers
to
the
question
would
incriminate
him.
now,
i
think
we
should
have
a
statement
--
brief
statement
of
the
facts
because
we
cannot
consider
this
question
of
law
abstractly
without
some
relationship
to
the
facts
for
--
mr.
samuel
mezansky
that's
one
of
the
grounds.
judge
medina
also
referred
to
the
issue
now
raised
by
the
government
as
to
the
duty
of
a
custodian
to
answer
questions
as
to
the
whereabouts
--
mr.
samuel
mezansky
it
was,
yes.
mr.
samuel
mezansky
that
was
the
ground
--
mr.
samuel
mezansky
pardon
me.
mr.
samuel
mezansky
in
the
--
mr.
samuel
mezansky
yes.
mr.
samuel
mezansky
well,
i
say
no
because
he
had
been
--
mr.
samuel
mezansky
there
is
no
basis.
mr.
samuel
mezansky
i
say
there's
no
basis
because
we
must
--
mr.
samuel
mezansky
no.
because
in
the
district
court,
the
sole
question
as
--
as
posed
by
district
judge
noonan,
was
whether
that
the
petitioner
was
required
to
satisfy
the
burden
of
proof
of
establishing
that
the
answers
to
the
question
would
incriminate
him.
mr.
samuel
mezansky
that's
correct.
mr.
samuel
mezansky
that
was
not
argued
in
the
district
court
at
all.
mr.
samuel
mezansky
that's
correct.
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
mezansky
that's
correct.
i
would
say
that's
true.
mr.
samuel
mezansky
well,
it
was
argued
from
the
first
time
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
the
government
in
its
brief
at
the
time
presented
for
the
first
time
the
question
that
this
petitioner
had
no
privilege
in
reference
to
union
books
and
records.
mr.
samuel
mezansky
no.
and
that's
one
of
the
points
i'm
making
that
he
was
--
the
attempt
is
now
made
to
sustain
the
conviction
upon
a
ground
not
urged
in
the
district
court.
mr.
samuel
mezansky
that's
correct.
mr.
samuel
mezansky
that's
right.
that's
one
of
the
points
we
urge.
now,
i
might
point
out
at
the
very
beginning
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
setting
becomes
important
in
these
types
of
case
that
this
petitioner
was
secretary-treasurer
of
local
269
and
he
was
served
with
two
subpoenas.
he
was
served
with
a
personal
subpoena
and
a
subpoena
duces
tecum.
and
in
each
subpoena,
he
was
directed
to
appear
and
testify
as
to
alleged
violations
of
the
federal
conspiracy
statute.
now,
those
subpoenas
appear
on
pages
47
and
48
of
the
record
and
that
fact
will
become
significant.
now,
what
was
the
general
setting?
this
petitioner
was
served
with
these
subpoenas
on
april
9th
for
his
appearance
on
april
10th.
about
a
week
and
a
half
before
that
date,
a
grand
jury
was
impaneled
in
new
york
to
investigate
allegations
of
racketeering
in
the
garment
and
trucking
industries.
this
investigation
followed
widespread
public
charges
that
seven
local
unions
were
recently
chartered
by
the
international
brotherhood
of
teamsters
to
gain
control
of
the
teamsters
joint
council.
it
was
charged
that
these
seven
locals
were
under
the
control
of
labor
racketeers
and
gangsters
and
particularly
one,
johnny
dioguardia.
one
martin
t.
lacey
was
then
president
of
the
teamsters
joint
council
had
commenced
a
civil
action
to
declare
a
certain
election
null
and
void.
and
in
that
civil
action,
mr.
lacey
had
made
this
allegation
of
fraud.judge
noonan,
who
found
this
petitioner
guilty
of
contempt,
had
issued
a
temporary
injunction
in
that
action.
the
newspapers
carry
stories
about
the
fact
that
mr.
lacey
conferred
with
one
of
the
assistant
united
states
attorneys
who
had
questioned
the
petitioner
before
the
grand
jury.
and
these
charges
were
dramatized
in
the
local
press,
so
that
the
setting
was
such
that
the
petitioner
would
reasonably
have
feared
that
the
--
and
only
was
he
--
to
be
fairly
investigated
but
that
he
was
to
be
prosecuted.
now,
as
we
all
know
in
a
war,
an
army
starts
an
attack
with
an
artillery
barrage
and
when
such
a
thing
happens,
the
opposing
army
knows
that
it
was
about
to
be
attacked.
well,
with
this
barrage
of
publicity,
a
lot
of
it
consisting
of
press
releases
from
the
united
states
attorney's
office,
this
petitioner
could
reasonably
have
sensed
the
peril
of
prosecution
for
a
wide
variety
of
offenses.
so
when
petitioner
first
appeared
before
the
grand
jury
on
april
10
and
his
lawyers
were
then
in
albany,
he
refused
to
answer
most
of
the
questions
saying,
as
appears
on
page
65
of
the
record,
“you
are
throwing
legal
stuff
at
me
and
i
don't
know
whether
you
are
trapping
me
or
not.”
he
was
told
to
come
back
on
april
12.
he
came
back
and
his
attorneys
remained
in
the
anteroom.
he
denied
that
he
had
possession
of
the
books
and
records
at
the
time
he
was
served
with
these
subpoenas
or
that
he
had
possession
for
at
least
three
days
prior
to
the
date
he
was
served
with
these
subpoenas.
and
then
at
page
83
of
the
record,
incidentally,
the
complete
transcript
of
the
grand
jury
testimony
appeared
in
the
record
before
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
but
was
not
before
the
district
court,
it
was
made
part
of
the
record
by
consent.
we
didn't
have
a
complete
transcript
of
the
grand
jury
testimony
until
after
the
petitioner
was
adjudged
guilty
of
contempt.
and
we
--
we
wanted
part
of
the
record,
so
to
show
the
connection
between
the
--
the
questions
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
the
books
and
other
questions.
we're
beginning
at
page
83.
we
have
a
series
of
questions
such
as
these,
“did
you
try
and
get
in
touch
with
johnny
dioguardia,
who
was
that
well-known
a
racketeer
after
he
was
served
with
subpoenas?
did
you
talk
to
him?
did
he
order
you
not
to
produce
the
books
and
records?
do
you
know
john
o'rourke?
when
did
he
last
see
the
records?”
then,
the
government
began
a
series
of
questions
as
to
where
the
records
were
on
certain
dates.
and
the
petitioner
sensing
he
was
being
tracked,
said
as
follows
at
page
85,
“they
are
leading
up
to
something
and
i
do
not
know
what
to
do.”
and
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
again
reframed
the
questions
and
asked
the
petitioner
where
the
--
where
the
books
were
on
various
days
for
about
two
weeks
prior
to
the
time
he
was
served
with
a
subpoena.
and
the
witness
refused
to
answer
those
questions
on
the
ground
of
his
right
to
remain
silent.
and
he
was
asked
other
questions
about
this
local
union
who
this
stationary
was
that
permit
the
stationary.
and
finally,
he
was
told
to
come
back
on
april
17.
in
the
meantime,
the
total
numbers
of
questions
asked
to
the
petitioner
were
about
225,
most
of
which
he
refused
to
answer.
on
april
17th,
the
grand
jury
recessed
and
reconvened
before
district
judge
noonan.
and
at
that
time,
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
submitted
as
an
exhibit
only
15
of
the
225
questions
as
the
basis
for
this
contempt.
and
judge
noonan
asked
the
petitioner
how
answering
the
questions
would
incriminate
him.
the
attorney
for
the
petitioner
gave
a
very
general
explanation
and
referred
to
the
charges
made
by
mr.
lacey
in
the
civil
litigation
that
was
then
going
on
upstairs.
the
court's
rule
that
the
privilege
was
improperly
exercised
and
direct
to
the
witness
to
answer
the
questions.
the
petitioner
was
taken
again
before
the
grand
jury
and
he
again
refused
to
answer
the
questions.
he
was
brought
back
before
judge
noonan
two
days
later
and
as
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
stated,
for
the
purpose
of
having
the
contempt
committed
in
the
presence
of
the
court
so
that
he
could
be
punished
summarily.
the
petitioner
was
put
on
the
stand
and
the
court
picked
out
these
15
selected
questions
and
the
court
did
not
know
of
the
nature
of
the
other
questions.
but
these
were
the
questions
carved
out
of
the
225
questions
by
the
assistant
united
states
attorney.
and
the
--
the
witness
again
declined
to
answer
those
15
selected
questions
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
the
books
and
records.
and
the
court
stated
that
under
the
decision
in
united
states
against
trock,
decided
by
the
second
circuit,
the
burden
was
upon
the
petitioner
to
satisfy
the
court
that
the
answers
to
the
questions
would
incriminate
him.
incidentally,
this
trock
decision
was
summarily
reversed
by
this
court
in
the
application
for
a
petition
for
certiorari
after
this
appeal
was
argued.
and
we
made
a
motion
for
rehearing
on
the
basis
of
this
court's
decision.
that
application
was
denied.
mr.
samuel
mezansky
no,
it
was
after.
now,
the
question
arose
in
the
proceeding
before
judge
noonan,
whether
this
proceeding
was
a
secret
proceeding
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
grand
jury
was
present.
and
the
court
remarked,
“no,
it's
not
a
secret
proceeding.”
and
the
court
noted
that
the
press
was
present.
and
then
on
page
34
of
the
record,
there
appears
a
statement
by
judge
noonan,
which
was
hardly
conducive
to
a
frank
disclosure
of
the
reasons
for
not
answering
the
question,
at
the
bottom
of
page
34,
the
court.
he
is
probably
afraid
that
if
he
wakes
up
some
morning
with
his
head
in
the
cement
block
at
the
bottom
of
the
east
river
if
he
talks
too
much
or
at
least
he
has
to
make
some
attempt
to
justify
it
if
he
should
talk
later
and
say
anything.
he
has
got
to
make
some
showing
in
advance
thereof
that
what
he
said
was
minimal
and
then
only
because
the
court
hit
him
over
the
head.
the
court
--
later
on,
the
court
said
it
was
joking
but
i
don't
know
whether
the
petitioner
appreciated
that
humor
in
any
event.
the
attorney
for
the
petitioner
asked
for
permission
to
furnish
the
explanation
in
private,
not
in
the
presence
of
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
or
the
grand
jury.
that
was
denied.
the
attorney
for
the
petitioner
asked
for
an
opportunity
of
furnishing
an
explanation
with
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
being
present
but
not
in
the
presence
of
the
grand
jury.
there
are
several
requests
for
a
complete
transcript
of
the
grand
jury
testimony
because
the
attorney
did
not
know
what
the
nature
of
the
other
questions
were.
these
requests
were
denied.
and
finally,
the
court
summarily
found
the
petitioner
guilty
of
contempt
and
sentenced
the
petitioner
to
six
months.
it
was
after
he
was
found
guilty
that
the
petitioner
received
a
complete
transcript
of
the
grand
jury
testimony
and
which
was
incorporated
in
the
record.
and
several
times
during
that
hearing
before
district
judge
noonan,
there
were
several
requests
for
an
opportunity
to
--
to
prepare
a
defense
and
produce
witnesses
and
those
requests
were
denied
because
judge
noonan
move
that
under
--
under
rule
42
(a),
a
summary
proceeding,
a
hearing
was
not
necessary.
mr.
samuel
mezansky
by
order
of
the
court.
the
united
states
attorney
--
we
--
we
asked
that
the
--
we
incorporate
in
the
record
before
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
these
clippings
that
appear
in
the
record.
they
were
not
before
the
district
judge.
and
that
is
used
--
the
united
states
attorney
consented
provided
we
consent
that
we
have
the
grand
jury
minutes
as
part
of
the
record
and
he
obtained
an
order
of
the
court
permitting
those
records
to
be
made
part
of
the
record.
now,
to
complete
the
picture,
i
should
mention
certain
facts
which
occurred
after
this
court
granted
certiorari
because
briefs
have
been
filed
by
the
government
and
by
petitioner's
attorney
with
respect
to
the
possible
mootness
of
this
case.
certiorari
was
granted
on
october
8,
1956
and
about
a
month
later,
the
government
subpoenaed
the
accountant
and
the
bookkeeper
for
the
union
before
the
grand
jury
and
they
testified
that
there
were
certain
books
and
records
then
in
existence
in
the
office
of
the
union.
the
u.s.
attorney
then
subpoenaed
the
petitioner
and
directed
him
to
produce
those
books
and
records
which
were
identified
by
the
accountant
and
the
bookkeeper.
these
records
were
produced
and
the
question
arose
what
effect
they
would
have
upon
the
prior
contempt
proceeding
and
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
made
a
claim
that
it
would
have
no
effect
as
far
as
the
government
was
concerned
because
the
other
contempt
was
one
that
was
committed
previously.
and
the
government
now
states
in
the
brief
filed
on
the
question
of
possible
mootness
and
incidentally,
the
solicitor
general
does
not
claim
that
this
appeal
was
moot.
but
says
that
now
with
the
books
in
their
possession,
the
question
as
to
the
petitioner's
privilege
stands
in
a
different
posture
and
that
possibly,
the
petitioner
could
go
to
the
lower
court
and
ask
for
a
modification
of
the
sentence.
now,
i
--
mr.
samuel
mezansky
no,
failure
to
answer
the
questions.
mr.
samuel
mezansky
yes,
but
they
say
that
now
--
mr.
samuel
mezansky
--
that
they
have
the
books
and
incidentally,
those
books
contained
entries
starting
with
august
1956
and
this
contempt
was
committed
in
april
1956.
but
they
say
that
now
that
they
have
the
books,
the
question
of
the
petitioner's
privilege
stands
in
a
different
posture
and
they
feel
that
if
we
went
before
district
judge
noonan,
we
might
obtain
a
modification
of
the
sentence.
however,
in
our
brief
filed,
in
respect
to
the
question
of
mootness,
we
say
that
the
petitioner's
posture
has
not
changed.
he
stands
convicted
of
an
offense
within
the
sentence
of
imprisonment
of
six
months.
and
he
is
reluctant
at
this
stage
to
answer
those
particular
questions
on
the
ground
of
self-incrimination
or
to
place
himself
at
the
mercy
of
the
court
that
found
him
in
contempt
to
court.
and
so
we
say
that
this
appeal
is,
therefore,
not
moot
and
i
believe
the
government
agrees.
but
in
frankness,
these
facts
were
submitted
to
the
court
by
separate
briefs
filed
in
december
of
last
year.
now,
we
come
then
to
the
main
legal
question,
the
government
concedes
that
if
a
--
if
the
petitioner
had
a
privilege,
that
he
made
an
adequate
showing
of
possible
incrimination,
so
that
the
government
is
now
seeking
to
affirm
this
order
of
punishing
the
petitioner
for
contempt
on
a
theory,
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out
also,
different
from
that
on
which
the
case
was
presented
in
the
district
court.
now,
the
solicitor
general
argues
that
a
custodian
of
union
records
may
not
refuse
on
the
ground
of
his
personal
privilege
against
self-incrimination
to
answer
questions
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
the
union
books
and
records.
the
government
says
that
this
issue
is
purely
one
of
law
that
no
hearing
is
necessary.
there
is
no
need
for
any
witnesses
and
that
rule
42
(a)
therefore
applies.
now,
before
discussing
that
question
--
that
very
narrow
legal
question
raised
by
the
solicitor
general,
i
should
like
to
say
something
about
this
procedure
under
rule
42
(a).
in
the
district
court,
the
petitioner
was
told
very
plainly
that
under
the
decision
in
trock
--
in
united
states
against
trock,
that
he
had
the
burden
of
establishing
that
the
answers
to
the
questions
would
incriminate.
he
was
not
warned
by
the
district
court
that
he
had
no
personal
privilege
in
respect
to
these
questions.
so
we
say
that
as
a
matter
of
simple
due
process,
whether
the
issue
is
one
of
fact
or
one
of
law,
the
petitioner
was
entitled
to
some
notice
that
that
was
the
basis
of
the
charge
against
him.
rule
42
(a)
deals
with
contempt
committed
in
the
actual
presence
of
the
court
and
upon
facts
which
are
within
the
judges'
personal
knowledge.
this
court
has
held
that
under
rule
42
(a),
knowledge
acquired
from
the
testimony
of
others
even
the
confession
of
the
accused
would
not
justify
conviction
for
contempt
without
a
trial
and
without
giving
contemnor
an
opportunity
to
defend.
leading
cases,
the
terry
case,
in
that
case,
the
marshal
was
assaulted
by
a
person
right
in
the
presence
of
the
court
and
there
rule
42
(a)
applied
and
the
court
saw
the
misbehavior.
but
in
this
case,
while
it
is
true
that
the
contempt
consists
of
the
petitioner's
refusal
to
answer
questions
as
directed
by
the
court,
the
validity
of
the
court's
order,
directing
the
petitioner
to
answer
the
question,
depends
upon
facts
which
were
not
within
the
knowledge
--
personal
knowledge
of
the
judge.
and
we,
therefore,
say
in
the
first
circuit,
in
carlson
against
united
states
so
held
that
under
these
circumstances,
a
witness
is
entitled
to
notice
of
the
charge
against
him
and
an
opportunity
--
he
should
be
given
an
opportunity
to
defend
the
charge
and
produce
witnesses
if
he
so
saw
fit.
he
was
also
entitled
to
a
complete
transcript
of
the
grand
jury
testimony.
that
was
the
holding
in
another
case
in
the
second
circuit
by
a
different
panel
of
the
same
court,
in
zwillman
case.
in
that
case,
the
court
--
judge
augustus
hand
wrote
that
the
government
was
not
obliged
to
disclose
the
testimony
before
the
grand
jury.
but
if
it
chose
to
adopt
such
attitude
and
to
confine
the
defendant's
defense
only
to
showing
that
the
questions
asked
were
incriminating
on
their
face,
you
could
not
put
him
in
contempt
so
long
as
it
prevented
him
from
adducing
evidence
that
would
demonstrate
that
his
answers
were
likely
to
form
links
in
proof
of
a
conspiracy.
we
turn
now
then
to
the
basic
legal
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
this
petitioner
had
a
personal
privilege.
the
government
says
that
as
secretary-treasurer
of
a
union,
he
had
no
privilege
what
was
bound
to
answer
questions
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
the
union
books
and
records.
as
i
pointed
out,
this
witness
was
served
with
two
subpoenas.
a
personal
subpoena
and
a
subpoena
duces
tecum.
and
in
each
subpoena,
he
was
directed
to
appear
and
testify
and
that
we
believe
is
a
very
significant
factor.
we
do
not
believe
that
this
witness
can
be
cutup
into
different
personalities
so
conveniently
and
we
do
not
believe
that
the
petitioner's
constitutional
rights
can
depend
upon
the
expert
use
of
the
scissors
or
the
carving
knife
by
carving
out
15
questions
and
disregarding
the
other
questions.
out
of
an
entire
interrogation
of
225
questions,
can
we
carved
out
just
15
and
say
that
as
to
these,
although,
the
answers
would
incriminate
the
petitioner
that
petitioner
in
his
capacity
as
custodian
had
no
privilege?
we
do
not
believe
and
we
submit
that
if
the
constitutional
question
cannot
be
decided
in
a
vacuum
or
in
an
isolation
booth
completely
unmindful
or
insensible
to
all
the
facts
and
the
fact
that
this
petitioner
was
a
perspective
defendant
and
he
was
directed
to
appear
and
testify
in
both
of
those
subpoenas.
now,
that
fact
is
significant
because
we
take
the
wilson
case.
in
that
case,
this
court
held
that
an
officer
of
a
corporation
could
not
refuse
to
produce
books
and
records
even
though
those
books
and
records
would
incriminate
the
officer.
in
united
states
against
white,
that
same
principle
was
applied
to
union
books
and
records.
but
in
the
wilson
case,
chief
justice
hughes
pointed
out,
there
is
no
question,
of
course,
of
oral
testimony
or
he
was
not
required
to
give
any.
in
the
wilson
case,
it
was
simply
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
with
no
direction
to
testify.
mr.
samuel
mezansky
that's
correct.
mr.
samuel
mezansky
that's
correct.
mr.
samuel
mezansky
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
mezansky
well,
then
you
would
be
affirming
a
judgment
on
the
ground
other
than
that
urged
in
the
district
court.
mr.
samuel
mezansky
now,
in
the
wilson
case,
he
was
not
required
to
testify.
in
the
white
case,
which
was
the
case
which
applied
to
union
books
and
records,
mr.
justice
murphy
pointed
out
that
there
was
no
effort
or
indicated
intention
to
examine
him
personally
as
a
witness.
well,
those
cases
have
no
application
and
both
of
those
cases
were
based
upon
the
fact
that
a
witness
may
not
complain
if
records
which
were
semipublic
in
character
furnished
the
incriminating
evidence.
and
the
question
now
presented
is
whether
these
principles
in
these
cases
may
be
projected
to
require
oral
testimony
of
an
officer
which
concededly
would
be
incriminated.
now,
the
argument
is
made
that
if
a
witness
of
a
corporation
--
an
officer
of
a
corporation
or
an
officer
of
a
union
is
required
to
produce
books
and
records,
shouldn't
he
be
required
to
answer
questions
auxiliary
to
their
production?
that
is
as
to
their
whereabouts.
there
is
a
case
in
the
second
circuit
where
such
--
such
statement
was
made
in
the
court's
opinion
but
that
referred
only
to
the
identification
of
the
records.
that
was
the
austin-bagley
case.
in
that
case,
the
defendant
was
charged
with
a
violation
of
the
national
prohibition
act.
the
united
states
attorney
introduced
the
books
and
records
of
the
corporation.
the
counsel
for
one
of
the
defendants,
the
officer,
objected
on
the
ground
that
the
records
were
not
identified
and
the
united
states
attorney
called
as
a
witness,
the
defendant
officer,
and
asked
him
to
identify
these
records.
and
the
court
held
that
he
was
required
to
identify
the
records
because
that
question
was
auxiliary
to
the
production
of
the
books
and
records.
there
is
no
decision
on
this
precise
question
by
this
court
and
the
question
has
not
appeared
in
any
other
decision
and
the
only
case
directly
in
point
on
this
precise
question
is
a
decision
of
a
new
york
court
recently
rendered
where
it
was
held
that
an
officer
of
a
union
could
refuse
to
testify
as
to
whereabouts
of
the
union
books
and
records.
now,
the
government
says
that
we
could
have
obtained
this
information
in
another
way.
we
could
have
started
a
proceeding
to
punish
this
petitioner
for
a
contempt
for
failing
to
produce
the
books
and
records.
in
that
proceeding,
he
would
have
been
required
to
furnish
a
reasonable
explanation
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
the
books
and
records.
now,
there
is
a
decision
in
the
eighth
circuit,
in
lopiparo
against
united
states,
decided
in
1954,
where
the
court
held,
it
was
a
2-to-1
decision,
where
the
court
held
that
in
such
a
proceeding
to
punish
a
witness
for
a
contempt
for
failing
to
produce
corporation
books
and
records,
the
witness
was
required
to
furnish
an
explanation
as
to
their
whereabouts.
there's
a
case
that
arose
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia,
traub
against
united
states,
which
rejects
that
reasoning
and
the
court
stated
to
refuse
to
follow
the
lopiparo
case
and
gave
adverse
reasons
the
following.
in
other
words,
the
witness
can
choose
his
own
brand
of
hemlock.
he
can
destroy
himself
either
by
failing
to
produce
records
called
for
by
subpoena,
even
they
were
not
in
his
possession
or
control
when
the
subpoena
was
served,
by
refusing
to
answer
questions
even
if
he
has
claimed
the
privilege
--
the
protection
of
the
privilege
and
there
has
been
no
judicial
determination
that
it
is
not
available
or
by
giving
incriminating
evidence.
the
court
stated
that
that
view
was
plainly
untenable.
now,
we
say
it's
no
answer
that
the
government
could
have
started
a
proceeding
to
punish
for
a
contempt
for
failing
to
produce
these
records.
in
such
a
proceeding,
the
burden
of
proof
would
have
been
upon
the
government
to
establish
that
these
books
and
records
were
in
the
possession
of
the
petitioner.in
that
proceeding,
there
would
have
been
the
presumption
of
innocence.
in
that
proceeding,
the
petitioner
could
have
submitted
other
remedies
rather
than
his
own
testimony
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
the
union
books
and
records
and
not
be
required
to
furnish
the
incriminating
evidence
from
his
own
lips.
we
recognized
that
the
fifth
amendment
was
written
in
part
to
prevent
any
congress
or
any
court
or
any
prosecutor
from
prying
open
the
lips
of
an
accused
to
make
incriminating
statements
against
his
will.
this
court
has
greatly
spoken
out
plainly
about
the
fifth
amendment
that
is
to
be
given
a
liberal
application
that
it
was
not
a
historical
relic
to
be
tolerated.
it
is
not
a
constitutional
nuisance.
we
say
that
the
principles
of
the
cases
in
the
wilson
or
white
cases
should
not
be
projected
to
require
a
person
to
furnish
the
incriminating
evidence
out
of
his
own
lips.
the
argument
of
the
government
cannot
be
reconciled
with
the
principles
established
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
as
to
the
application
of
the
fifth
amendment.
we
submit
that
this
petitioner
should
not
be
required
to
testify
to
facts
which
would
furnish
a
link
in
the
chain
of
testimony
to
convict
him.
no
subtle
or
fine
distinction
should
be
permitted
to
deprive
this
petitioner
of
his
privilege
to
remain
silent
and
the
government
has
conceded
that
if
he
answered
these
questions,
they
would
incriminate
him.
judge
medina,
writing
for
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
stated
that
counsel
seems
to
suppose
that
notorious
criminals,
racketeers
and
unsavory
characters
generally
have
an
open
sesame
to
the
privilege
guaranteed
by
the
fifth
amendment.
we
suppose
nothing
of
the
kind.
the
rulings
of
this
court
require
that
any
assertion
in
good
faith
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
must
be
respected,
whether
the
privilege
is
asserted
by
a
criminal,
a
communist,
a
school
teacher
or
a
business
person.
we
say
that
by
reason
of
these
facts,
the
foregoing
principles,
this
letter
should
be
reversed.
