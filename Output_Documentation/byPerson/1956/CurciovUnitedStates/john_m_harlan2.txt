doesn't
the
government
concede
that
if
the
privilege
is
available,
the
answers
would
have
been
within
the

it
seems
to
me
it
eliminates
a
large
part
of
the
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
the
contempt
sentence
was
not
for
failure
to
produce
the
books,
was
it?

failure
to
answers
the
questions.

(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
clarify
my
mind
on
something?if
we
hold
that
this
privilege
was
available
to
him
that
requires
a
reversal
of
this
case,
doesn't
it?
justice

because
the
government's
concession
as
--
is
that
the
privilege
was

there
were
sufficient
grounds
for
believing
he's
been
incriminated.
justice
john
m.

is
that
right?
justice
john
m.

and
if
we
hold
that
the
--
the
privilege
was

was
not
available
and
what
is
their
basis
on

well,
so
what
--
justice
john
m.

supposing
this
man
had
taken
these
books
and
used
them
for
--
to
start
a
fire,
to
burn
down
a
government
warehouse
and
then,
he
is
called
before
the
grand
jury
on
that
charge
and
he
is
asked
the
question,
did
you
use
these
corporate
books
to
start
that
fire?
can
he
claim
his
privilege?
justice
john
m.
harlan
extreme
case,
but
it
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
then
he
gets
punished
for
not
producing
the
books.
