ms.

chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
the
--
where
is
the
ruling,
ms.
rosenberg?
chief
justice
earl
warren
ms.
rosenberg,
i
understood
mr.
mezansky
to
say
that
these
books
weren't
even
prepared
until
after
--
after
this
man
was
convicted
of
contempt.
so
how
could
--
how
could
he
have
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
delivered
the
books
if
we're
not
even
prepared
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
before
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
fact?
were
they
--
are
they
books
that
were
prepared
after
this
man
was
convicted
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
wouldn't
want
us
to
declare
this
case
and
move
just
because
somebody
might
think
those
things
if
there
was
nothing
in
the
--
in
the
record
to
establish
it
then
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
the
indication
is
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
there
were
books
that
was
prepared
after
the
--
after
the
man
was
convicted.
you
wouldn't
ask
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
would
seem
to
me
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know.
but
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
government
would
be
a
little
more
precise
in
this
information
that
it's
apparent
we
would
want
on
the
--
on
the
questions
to
that
kind
is
to
whether
the
books
actually
were
in
existence
or
whether
they
were
not.
and
just
to
say
that
--
that
you
didn't
really
pursue
it
but
that
the
united
states
attorney
thinks
it
might
have
been
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
might
have
been
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
prepared
before.
that
isn't
the
very
accurate.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
you
did
tell
us
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
you
did
tell
us
that
the
judge
gave
him
an
opportunity
to
purge
himself.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
not
by
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
not
by
producing
the
books.
so
you
do
make
the
distinction
yourself
between
the
act
of
producing
the
books
and
the
answering
of
these
questions.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
do
we
--
where
do
we
find
the
precise
words
of
the
judge
in
finding
him
guilty?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
43.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
what
does
he
say
he
is
convicting
him
for
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
must
have
been
some
place
between
40
and
45.
i
--
i
would
like
to
see
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
you
may
proceed
ms.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
say
he's
convicted
though
of
failing
to
answer
the
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
let
me
ask
you
this
question,
ms.
rosenberg.
suppose
you
prevail
in
this
case,
the
man
goes
to
jail
for
six
months
for
failure
to
answer
these
questions,
would
you
go
back
to
the
district
court
then
prosecute
him
for
not
producing
the
books?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no,
no.
let's
just
--
let's
just
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
there
are
two
separate
and
distinct
crimes,
definitely?
