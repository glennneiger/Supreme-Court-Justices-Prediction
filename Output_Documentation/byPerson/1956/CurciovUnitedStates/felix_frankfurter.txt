justice
felix
frankfurter
please
enlighten
me.
do
i
understand
that
the
court
of
appeals
sustained
the
conviction
solely
on
the
ground
that
the
claim
of
personal
privilege
was
made
and
that
the
claim
of
personal
privilege
was
not
well
founded?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say,
now
raised,
it
must
have
been
raised
below
then
and
he
was
--
the
conviction
--
he
was
partly
sustained
on
that
ground,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
--
if
you
were
right
then
--
then
the
government
--
i
may
have
misunderstood
probably
there.
i
got
the
impression
that
he
was
convicted
on
one
ground,
namely,
a
personal
claim
of
privilege
as
the
government
now
said
that
that
was
it,
it
was
well
founded.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
rather
than
that
the
claimed
privilege
for
--
for
a
custodial
documents
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
difference
--
what
i
--
if
you
--
he
wouldn't
have
to
answer
this
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
--
is
there
any
legal
ground
why
this
judgment
couldn't
be
sustained
here
on
theory
that
in
the
record
there
was
a
refusal
to
answer,
which
is
legally
baseless?
in
that,
he
has
corporate
books
or
documents,
whatever
they
are,
as
to
which
he
had
no
privilege?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
has
to
know
that
there
is
no
basis
for
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
the
merit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
the
merits,
but
was
it
in
issue
below
and
was
the
sentence
impart
for
asserting
a
corporate
immunity
which
he
can't
assert?
justice
felix
frankfurter
him,
as
a
person?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
that
he
can't
assert
a
privilege
for
the
production
of
books
that
aren't
his.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
so
far
as
the
record
shows,
we
don't
know
--
there's
no
basis
or
findings
that
the
district
court
would
have
held
him
responsible
for
accusing
to
answer
on
that
ground
and
sentenced
him
on
that
ground,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
on
that
concept,
we
don't
know
if
this
ground
is
out,
either
(a),
that
the
district
court
would
have
found
guilty
or
(b),
would
have
given
a
six-month
sentence,
was
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
how
could
--
how
could
the
court
of
appeals
have
sustained
the
sentence
on
that
other
ground
if
that
wasn't
an
issue?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
doesn't
appear
at
all
in
the
proceedings
before
the
district
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
he
--
it's
more
that.
it
isn't
merely
a
ground.
the
government
as
anybody
else
in
a
litigation
can
sustain
a
judgment
on
any
ground
to
sustain
but
if
i
empower
you,
there
was
a
finding
of
contempt
and
a
sentence
for
contempt
on
a
claim
of
disobedience
to
the
court's
order,
which
is
very
different
from
the
claim
that
is
now
made
why
he
was
disobedient.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
should
--
that
raises
the
--
not
the
usual
questions
sustaining
the
judgment
on
some
other
ground
on
that
on
which
it
was
rendered.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
on
what
ground
were
the
grand
jury
minutes
finally
acquainted?
who
furnished
it?
was
it
by
order
of
the
court?
