i
think
we'll

chief
justice

recess
now,
mr.
greenberg.
chief
justice
earl
warren
goldberg,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
greenberg,
excuse
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
that
page?
chief
justice
earl
warren
230.
chief
justice
earl
warren
wasn't
there
something
in
the
record
to
show
that
that
was
a
custom
in
the
community?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
what
was
that?
did
you
know
if
you
don't
why
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
mr.
straub.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
he
taken
to
a
magistrate
before
he
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
before
they
went
to
the
penitentiary?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
he
told
before
that
time
that
he
had
a
right
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
was
he
told?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understand
from
you
then
that
it
is
the
custom
not
to
take
them
before
a
magistrate,
unless,
they
demand
a
preliminary
hearing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
long
would
you
hold
him
in
jail
without
taking
him
before
a
magistrate
under
those
circumstances
in
accordance
with
your
practices?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
it
be
weeks?
could
it
be
months?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
would
you
--
how
would
you
accomplish
it
and
when
would
you
accomplish
it
and
according
to
your
custom,
let's
say
how
did
the
grand
jury
didn't
meet
to
indict
this
man
for
a
month
or
so
when
--
what
would
you
do?
would
you
just
leave
him
in
jail
there
all
that
time
without
taking
him
to
a
magistrate?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
law
--
what
is
the
law
of
alabama
say
as
to
whether
he
shall
be
taken
to
a
magistrate?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
then
that
they
--
they
go
absolutely
contrary
to
the
law
in
your
practice
in
alabama?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
that
what
happened
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
don't
--
you
don't
say
then
that
this
was
in
accordance
with
customer
practice.
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
was
contrary.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
was
no
affidavit
as
a
prerequisite
to
this
order
and
no
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
testimony
taken.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
evidence
of
the
defendant
being
taken
before
the
judge?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
consent
of
the
defendant.
chief
justice
earl
warren
nothing
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
his
father
see
him
on
sunday?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
was
it
--
i
understood
counsel
to
say
that
his
father
had
tried
to
see
him
before
the
confessions
were
taken
and
refused
admission.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
what
reason
was
assigned
for
not
letting
the
father
see
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
did
the
lawyer
try
to
see
him
first?
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
know
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
let
the
newspapers
in?
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
i
ask
you
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
--
does
a
private
citizen
have
the
right
to
arrest
another
one
on
suspicion
in
your
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
return
to
brown
versus
allen
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
did
you
--
did
you
have
a
question
of
retarded
mentality
in
that
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
wasn't
there
more
--
there's
more
than
that
in
this
case,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
state
have
any
psychiatrist
examine
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
state
put
on
any
testimony
at
all
directed
toward
the
insanity
defense?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
just
ask
a
question
as
i
--
i
haven't
quite
got
this
clear
in
my
mind
but
the
way
i
--
i
read
it
here
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
page
--
at
page
190,
that's
almost
the
beginning
of
this
particular
--
the
testimony
on
this
particular
instance,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
at
that
time,
referring
to
page
140,
about
two-thirds
down
the
page,
the
--
attorney
hall
says,
"if
your
honor
please,
we
are
going
to
ask
the
court
to
exclude
the
jury
at
this
time."
that's
before
there
--
there
were
any
testimony
given
by
the
officers
as
to
how
it
was
obtained.
the
defendant
would
like
to
take
an
objection
to
this
particular
line
of
questioning
and
objected
to
the
manner
in
which
the
witness
is
being
questioned.
we
feel
that
the
jury's
presence
in
this
court
would
be
prejudicial
to
the
defendant's
interest.
so
he
objected
to
this
evidence
being
given
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
and
then
the
court
declared
a
recess.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
when
they
came
back,
they
started
right
in
without
anything
being
said
about
this
objection
that
the
defendant
made.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
tantamount
to
the
court
overruling
the
objection,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
you're
not
inferring
that
the
defendant
consented
to
do
this
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
no,
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
have
to
take
an
exception
to
the
court's
ruling
in
your
state?
you
don't
--
in
my
state
that
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
during
a
middle
of
a
trial
a
defendant
claims
that
he's
ill
and
asked
for
a
continuance
and
the
officers
take
the
stand
and
testify
this
man
isn't
ill,
he's
a
malingerer.
and
the
witness
say
--
the
defendant
says,
"well,
i
want
to
take
the
stand
and
testify
that
i'm
not
malingering,
that
i'm
--
i'm
a
sick
man,
that
i'm
in
great
pain
and
i
can't
continue
with
the
trial."
the
judge
should
say
to
him,
"well,
now
if
you
take
the
stand,
testify
to
that
and
throw
yourself
wide
open
to
--
to
cross-examination
on
your
guilt
or
innocence."
chief
justice
earl
warren
what's
the
difference
between
that
and
this
collateral
matter
as
to
whether
these
men
unduly
--
illegally
obtain
this
confession?
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
yet.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
judge
said
open
it
to
for
all
purposes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
shouldn't
that
--
and
that
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
at
all,
as
i
understood
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
isn't
there
a
third
one
there
too
that
he
--
that
he's
trying
to
preserve?
isn't
he
trying
to
preserve
his
right
not
to
have
a
coerced
confession
introduced
against
him,
which
has
been
determined
by
this
court
to
be
a
constitutional
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
there's
a
--
there's
a
third
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
isn't
just
as
reasonable
that
he
is
trying
to
maintain
his
right
not
to
be
a
witness
against
himself
and
at
the
same
time,
protect
himself
against
other
people
giving
illegal
testimony
against
him.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
i'll
--
i'll
accept
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
finish
your
thought.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
mr.
greenberg.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
to
raise
justice
brennan's
question
to
a
constitutional
level,
suppose
this
revolver
that
he's
speaking
about
was
--
was
to
be
introduced
in
evidence
and
the
claim
was
by
the
defense
that
the
home
had
been
burglarized,
suppose
this
was
a
federal
case
and
defendant
claim
that
his
home
had
been
burglarized
by
a
federal
officer
and
this
--
this
gun
had
been
--
been
taken
and
that
preliminary
--
preliminary
question
was
being
tried
by
the
court.
i
presume
the
defendant
could
take
the
stand
and
testify
that
--
that
he
saw
the
federal
officer
come
--
come
in
there
and
burglarize
his
home
without
--
without
subjecting
himself
to
cross-examination
on
--
on
the
guilt
or
innocence
on
the
charge
against
him,
couldn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
--
yes.
so,
that
isn't
--
that
is
different
from
the
one
justice
brennan
made
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
it
seemed
to
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
is
not
a
disqualification,
it
was
an
exemption.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you,
mr.
greenberg.
