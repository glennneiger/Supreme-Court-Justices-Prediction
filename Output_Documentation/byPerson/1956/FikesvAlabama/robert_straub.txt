mr.
robert
straub
if
it
please
the
court,
the
record
here
before
us
deals
with
a
great
number
of
facts
which
we
think
are
pertinent
to
an
understanding
of
the
applicable
rules
of
law
and
i
would
like
briefly
to
go
through
the
facts
first
of
all
leading
up
to
the
confessions
which
were
before
the
court
and
which
deal
directly
with
whether
or
not
the
confessions
were
coerced
and
the
question,
whether
or
not
he
was
denied
his
rights
and
not
being
able
to
testify
as
to
the
voluntariness
of
those
confessions
without
further
cross-examination.
now,
as
has
been
stated,
the
petitioner
was
picked
up
wondering
around
an
alley
about
--
about
midnight
of
saturday
night
or
early
sunday
morning.
and
he
was
taken
to
the
police
station
were
he
was
booked
on
an
open
charge
of
investigation.
now,
the
next
morning
--
he
wasn't
questioned
any
that
night,
it
doesn't
appear.
the
next
morning,
beginning
about
10
o'clock,
he
was
questioned
for
about
two
hours
by
the
captain
of
police.
now,
the
captain
testified
that
that
was
intermittent
questioning.
it
--
the
routine
business
of
the
police
station
was
being
carried
on
at
the
same
time
and
they
would
stop
and
see
these
folks
and
those
folks
and
get
a
drink
of
water
and
so
on
and
so
forth
for
about
two
hours.
it
wasn't
a
constant
grueling
questioning
according
to
the
testimony.
mr.
robert
straub
began
at
10
o'clock,
your
honor,
10
o'clock
to
12
approximately,
the
testimony
shows
it.
mr.
robert
straub
in
the
police
captain's
office
as
i
recall.
it
was
in
the
station
itself,
somewhere
there.
now,
in
the
afternoon
or
some
time
during
this
questioning
period,
the
petitioner
apparently
asked
to
have
the
sheriff
of
his
home
county.
now,
he
was
not
a
native
of
that
particular
county.
he
was
from
a
neighboring
country
some
28
miles
away.
mr.
robert
straub
marion
county
--
perry
county,
excuse
me,
marion,
alabama
in
perry
county.
and
he
requested
to
that
sheriff
to
be
notified
of
his
predicament
and
he
also
requested
the
people
to
notify
his
employer
over
in
marion
and
the
police
officers
did
so.
and
the
sheriff
of
marion
county
whom
he
had
requested
to
see
came
to
see
him
at
perry
county,
came
to
see
him
that
sunday
afternoon
to
see
what
was
--
what
was
wrong.
and
during
the
course
of
the
questioning
in
the
afternoon,
the
sheriff
of
perry
county
together
with
police
officers
and
the
petitioner
rode
around
town
for
about
20
minutes,
i
think,
in
between
the
questioning
periods
of
that
afternoon.
now,
on
monday
--
mr.
robert
straub
according
to
my
accounting
and
to
the
testimony,
your
honor,
for
two
and
one-half
or
three
hours
on
sunday
afternoon.
mr.
robert
straub
including
this
--
and
during
that
two
and
a
half
or
three
hours,
they
took
20
or
so
minutes
out.
mr.
robert
straub
they
visited
--
they
drove
around
some
of
the
houses.
they
did
not
stop
apparently
and
then
go
in
or
go
around
back
or
anything
like
that,
but
they
did
drive
around
town
during
this
time.
now,
on
monday
morning
--
mr.
robert
straub
it
does
not
appear.
on
monday,
the
petitioner's
employer
then,
also
in
response
to
his
request,
came
to
see
him.
and
at
that
time,
a
warrant
was
made
out
against
the
petitioner
and
served
on
him.
now,
they
questioned
him
on
monday
for
about
one
and
a
half
or
two
hours
in
the
morning
beginning
about
9
o'clock.
now,
he
had
been
permitted
to
sleep,
eat
during
sunday
evening
then
about
9
o'clock
in
the
morning,
they
--
they
questioned
him
again.
now
in
the
afternoon,
about
3
o'clock,
they
took
him
to
kilby
prison.
now,
kilby
prison
is
about
50
or
55,
perhaps
60
miles.
it's
distance
from
selma
to
montgomery.
now,
this
testimony
is
that
they
took
him
there
for
his
own
protection
and
has
been
brought
out
that
there
was
no
threat
and
violence,
nobody
had
actually
attacked
the
petitioner
and
no
demonstrations
had
come
about.
mr.
robert
straub
the
only
press
articles
in
the
record
before
us
is
the
one
spoken
about
by
counsel
for
petitioner
regarding
the
confession.
there
is
no
evidence
of
inflamed
public
opinion.
mr.
robert
straub
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
straub
no,
sir.
but
we
take
this
position
on
that
your
honor,
that
although
no
violence
appeared,
the
crime
was
of
such
a
nature
and
the
circumstances
such
that
we
see
nothing
wrong
with
the
police
officers
protecting
their
prisoner
and
themselves
for
that
matter
by
taking
him
away
from
where
--
why
wait
until
something
breaks
out
and
then
try
to
stop
it?
go
ahead.
mr.
robert
straub
on
monday,
he
was
charged
with
burglary
in
the
second
--
in
the
first
degree.
mr.
robert
straub
yes,
sir.
before
he
was
taken
to
kilby.
mr.
robert
straub
no
sir,
he
was
not.
mr.
robert
straub
he
was
not.
mr.
robert
straub
it
doesn't
appear
why,
other
than
this
that
he
would
have
ordinarily
been
taken
to
the
city
recorder
since
he
was
picked
up
by
the
city
police
--
i
mean,
turned
over
to
the
city
police.
but
in
cases
where
they
don't
request
a
preliminary
hearing
or
they're
not
going
to
appear
before
the
city
recorder,
they're
not
put
on
the
docket,
not
taken.
if
they
request
just
preliminary
hearing,
they
are
taken
before
the
city
recorder
when
they're
picked
up
by
the
city
police.
mr.
robert
straub
testimony
of
captain
baker,
i
believe,
or
perhaps
the
chief
of
police,
one
of
those
two
officers
is
to
the
effect
that
he
was
told
of
his
rights
but
did
not
request
a
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
robert
straub
shortly
after
he
was
picked
up
or
at
least
on
sunday
during
the
questioning.
in
fact,
the
police
officers
testified
that
before
every
period
of
questioning,
they
told
him
of
his
rights.
they
did
enumerate
them,
but
in
response
to
--
when
they
were
dealing
with
--
in
the
questioning
in
the
case
with
whether
or
not
he
was
taken
to
a
magistrate,
one
of
the
police
officers,
or
perhaps
both
of
them
testified
that
they
did
explain
his
rights
to
him,
but
he
did
not
ask
for
a
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
robert
straub
if
they
demand
a
preliminary
hearing
as
my
understanding
of
the
practice,
it's
usually
the
custom
not
to
take
them.
if
they
want
a
preliminary
hearing,
they
go
to
a
magistrate.
if
they
want
bond
of
course
the
judge
have
to
set
a
bond.
mr.
robert
straub
well
sir,
i
--
i
can't
answer
that
question.
i
don't
know.
mr.
robert
straub
oh
no,
sir.
i
would
not
think
so,
no.
mr.
robert
straub
if
he
requested
to
be
taken
before
a
magistrate
or
requested
a
bond
or
requested
a
preliminary
hearing,
we
would
take
him
immediately.
mr.
robert
straub
the
law
on
--
and
rest
under
these
circumstances
where
a
civilian
arrests
and
turns
him
over
to
the
police,
he
shall
be
taken
forthwith
to
a
magistrate.
that
is
law.
now
--
mr.
robert
straub
i'm
speaking,
sir,
of
when
he
is
arrested
by
a
civilian
and
turned
over
to
the
police
then
the
police
must
forthwith
take
him
to
a
magistrate.
mr.
robert
straub
yes,
sir.
however
--
mr.
robert
straub
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
straub
i
do
not
--
i
say
that
this
is
not
according
to
the
law,
to
the
statute.
it
is
not
according
to
the
statute.
we
--
we
are
afraid
to
admit
that
because
it
just
appears
that.
mr.
robert
straub
however,
the
alabama
cases
as
i
would
deal
later
have
held
and
has
--
that
the
failure
to
comply
with
that
statute
does
not
of
itself
render
a
statement
or
a
confession
taken
under
those
circumstances
involuntary.
now,
during
the
trip
to
kilby
prison,
there
was
only
general
conversation
as
the
record
states.
he
was
taken
there
and
entered
under
the
order
of
a
circuit
judge
of
the
selma
circuit.
he
was
questioned
some
that
afternoon
and
for
a
little
while
after
supper.
now,
it
doesn't
appear
how
much.
it
says
he
was
questioned
for
several
hours
that
afternoon
while
he
left
selma
at
3
o'clock
and
so
it
was
a
matter
of
driving
50
to
60
miles
before
they
could
question
him
again
and
then
it
said
we
didn't
question
him
too
late
in
the
evening
and
it
doesn't
appear
how
much
at
that
time.
mr.
robert
straub
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
straub
yes,
sir.
that
is
right.
mr.
robert
straub
that
does
not
appear,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
straub
somebody
asked
or
obtained.
mr.
robert
straub
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
robert
straub
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
straub
yes,
sir,
somebody,
and
it
doesn't
appear.
mr.
robert
straub
yes,
sir.
it
does
not
appear
--
mr.
robert
straub
no.
mr.
robert
straub
we
do
not
contend
it
was
an
arraignment
because
it
does
--
we
--
we
don't
know.
but
we
do
know
that
either
ex
parte
or
bringing
him
up
there
somehow
or
rather
a
circuit
judge
knew
that
he
was
in
this
--
that
he
was
--
had
been
arrested
and
that
they
wanted
to
take
him
over
to
kilby
prison
and
so
--
mr.
robert
straub
i
doubt
very
much,
your
honor,
if
the
prison
officials
would
accept
a
prisoner
without
some
order.
i'm
pretty
sure
that
they
would
not.
mr.
robert
straub
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
straub
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
straub
no
sir.
mr.
robert
straub
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
straub
nothing.
just
the
fact
testimony
in
one
or
two
places
that
there
was
an
order
of
a
circuit
judge
and
the
order
itself
by
the
way
does
not
appear
in
the
record.
we
don't
know
what
kind
of
an
order
it
was.
there
was
some
sort
of
judicial
intervention
there
to
that
extent,
that
limited
extent.
now,
he
was
placed
in
what
the
prison
officials
at
kilby
prison
called
segregation
during
his
stay.
now,
this
is
not
solitary
confinement
in
the
sense
that
he
is
placed
in
a
dark
cell
and
not
allowed
to
see
anybody
or
talk
or
anything
else.
it's
customary
with
prisoners
who
are
being
held
for
other
authorities
to
segregate
them
from
the
general
run
of
prisoners
there
at
kilby
prison
and
excel
itself
according
to
the
testimony
has
a
comfortable
bed
and
all
of
the
conveniences.
he's
just
not
allowed
to
mingle
with
the
prisoners
who
are
there
serving
a
term.
that
apparently
is
customary
not
only
in
case
of
prisoners
held
or
other
authorities
but
in
new
prisoners
coming
in
for
a
short
period
of
time.
now,
he
got
there
on
monday
and
he
was
not
questioned
again
until
wednesday.
it
doesn't
appear
how
long
he
was
questioned
on
wednesday
except
for
the
fact
they
had
several
conservations
with
him.
then
on
thursday,
no
questioning
in
the
morning
but
in
the
afternoon,
they
had
two
conversations
with
him,
one
lasting
two
hours
and
one,
one
and
a
half
hours.
now
--
mr.
robert
straub
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
straub
no
sir.
the
relay
questioning
was
not
used.
apparently,
captain
baker
was
the
chief
interrogator
and
he
came
--
he
was
present
at
all
of
the
sessions,
i
believe.
a
lieutenant
ware
came
at
sometimes
and
one
or
two
of
the
prison
officials
at
sometimes
were
in
and
out
but
apparently
took
no
part
in
the
questioning
and
no
appreciable
amount
of
questioning.
mr.
robert
straub
captain
of
police,
police
captain
in
selma.
mr.
robert
straub
no.
mr.
robert
straub
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
straub
that
to
me
is
clear
in
this
case.
i
believe,
your
honor,
will
find
it
so
by
reading
the
record.
mr.
robert
straub
yes.
at
this
thursday
afternoon
question,
he
was
advised
that
anything
he
said
would
be
recorded
and
they
showed
him
the
recording
apparatus
and
took
a
recording
of
his
confession.
thereafter,
they
--
they
left
him
rest
until
saturday.
they
didn't
--
apparently
he
went
back
to
his
cell
and
stayed
until
saturday.
and
then
they
talked
to
him
for
15
or
20
more
minutes
in
the
morning
and
about
three
and
a
half
hours
in
the
afternoon.
on
sunday,
his
father
came
to
see
him.
sunday
is
visiting
day
at
--
at
kilby
and
his
father
came
to
see
him.
no
questioning
on
monday.
on
tuesday,
the
officers
drove
back
again
to
selma
--
from
selma.
mr.
robert
straub
yes,
sir.
while
he
was
--
mr.
robert
straub
there
is
testimony
that
his
father
came
on
a
thursday
before
and
was
denied
admission
but
was
permitted
to
see
him
on
sunday,
the
regular
visiting
day
at
kilby.
mr.
robert
straub
no
reason
was
assigned
in
the
testimony
and
it's
not
in
the
record
but
from
personal
knowledge,
i
do
know
that
sunday
is
visiting
day
out
there.
now,
whether
that
--
i
mean,
that
was
probably
the
reason
that
the
--
the
prison
officials
would
give,
but
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
records.
mr.
robert
straub
the
lawyer,
according
to
testimony
in
the
record,
came
on
a
saturday.
now,
warren
burford
said
he
didn't
know
what
saturday
it
was
--
mr.
robert
straub
it
could
--
didn't
know
what
saturday
it
was.
it
could
have
been
the
saturday
before
the
--
the
confession.
i
mean,
the
saturday
between
the
confessions.
you
see,
one
was
made
on
thursday
and
one
the
following
tuesday.
so
the
lawyer
didn't
come
before
the
first
confession
if
he
came
on
the
saturday
between.
it
isn't
quite
clear
when
he
did
come,
but
warren
burford
says
it
could
have
been
at
one
right
between
confessions.
you
see,
the
--
the
prisoner
stayed
at
kilby
after
both
confessions
for
some
length
of
time.
mr.
robert
straub
i
think
that's
about
--
mr.
robert
straub
that's
about
the
only
testimony
on
it
that
it
was
--
mr.
robert
straub
the
lawyer
did
not
come
and
testify,
no
sir.
and
it
was
shown
that
when
he
did
come,
he
said
he
wasn't
retained
in
the
case
and
there's
testimony
that
lawyers
are
not
committed
to
solicit
business
in
--
in
kilby
prison
and
of
course,
we
don't
(inaudible)
their
solicity
anywhere
but
lawyers
are
not
permitted
to
roam
about
kilby
prison
to
solicit
business.
and
this
particular
attorney
stated
that
he
didn't
represent
the
petitioner
when
he
came
out.
as
i
said,
his
father
visited
him
on
sunday
and
then
on
tuesday
after
lunch
during
about
an
hour's
conversation,
he
confessed
again.
now,
this
time
--
i
don't
believe
it
was
taken
down
on
a
recorder.
that
might
have
been
adjacent
to
it,
but
it
was
taped,
dictated
to
a
stenographer,
took
it
down
in
shorthand
and
transcribed
it.
one
of
your
honors
asked
what
the
difference
in
the
two
confessions.
well,
there
is
one
difference
and
maybe
the
reason
for
getting
the
second
one
was
that
the
first
was
taken
on
a
tape
recorder.
they
decided
they
wanted
something
in
writing
signed
by
the
petitioner
so
they
got
the
second
confession.
now,
at
no
time,
and
this
appears
in
the
record,
both
by
just
reading
it
and
by
actual
testimony
that
no
time
during
his
stay
was
he
denied
food
or
water
or
rest
or
abused
in
any
way.
there's
absolutely
no
question,
no
testimony
concerning
any
physical
abuse.
and
the
longest
period
of
questioning
was
not
more
than
three
and
half
hours.
unless,
you
take
a
newspaper
article,
which
says
it
was
nine
hours
and
then
on
cross-examination
or
during
testimony
by
the
newspaper
reporter,
he
said
that
he
assumed
that
number,
made
an
assumption
of
nine.
mr.
robert
straub
yes,
sir.
he
testified
on
the
trial.
mr.
robert
straub
oh,
at
the
questioning,
no,
sir.
no,
no.
no,
he
was
not
present.
no.
mr.
robert
straub
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
straub
yes.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
straub
in
cross-examination.
mr.
robert
straub
and
to
the
further
circumstance
that
he
apparently
had
no
witness
present
at
that
--
that
he
wanted
to
call
and
prove
by
others.
mr.
robert
straub
that's
true.
mr.
robert
straub
that's
true.
mr.
robert
straub
the
officers
and
in
the
case
of
the
second
confession,
the
woman
stenographer
who
was
employed
by
the
prison
department
in
its
stenographic
capacity,
i
think.
mr.
robert
straub
he
was,
according
to
the
testimony,
wandering
around
at
midnight
in
an
alley
in
a
white
neighborhood.
that
is
all
it
appears
in
the
testimony.
whether
there
was
more
to
it
or
not,
it
doesn't
appear.
that's
--
that's
it.
he
was
picked
up
by
one
man
and
taken
to
a
filling
station
where
they
called
the
police.
now,
we
contend,
first
of
all,
that
under
alabama
statutes
--
on
alabama
cases
exemplified
by
ingram
against
the
state
which
we've
cited
in
our
brief
that
the
failure
of
an
officer
to
comply
with
our
statute
that
requires
him
to
take
to
a
magistrate
immediately
or
forthwith,
does
not
render
involuntary
a
confession
obtained
under
those
circumstances.
and
we
call
the
court's
attention
first
of
all
to
stein
against
new
york
where
admittedly
the
questioning
was
not
as
long
as
here.
but
in
stein,
he
was
not
taken.
the
--
the
prisoner
was
not
taken
before
a
magistrate
forthwith
as
is
required
by
new
york
law
and
this
court
in
considering
the
overall
picture
of
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession
held
that
that
of
itself
didn't
require
the
exclusion
even
though
they
went
contra
to
a
new
york
statute.
turning
then
--
mr.
robert
straub
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
straub
if
i
recall
the
statutes
correctly,
a
private
citizen
may
arrest
for
a
felony
committed
in
his
presence
or
when
he
has
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
a
felony
has
been
committed
and
that
the
person
he
arrest
has
committed
it
or
is
connected
with
it.
i
believe
that's
it.
he
may
arrest
for
a
misdemeanor
committed
in
his
presence,
i
believe.
i
--
i'm
not
too
clear
on
that
but
there
is
a
distinction
between
felony
and
misdemeanor.
i
think
that
it
is.
in
brown
against
allen,
the
accused
was
illiterate.
he
was
held
for
five
days
before
being
charged
and
he
was
given
no
preliminary
hearing
for
18
days.
after
his
arrest
--
and
no
counsel
was
provided
either.
the
confession
in
that
case
was
obtained
prior
to
the
appointment
of
counsel
and
prior
to
any
preliminary
hearing.
now,
the
court
in
that
case,
you
--
you
all
did
point
out
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
physical
coercion
which
we
have
no
evidence
here
and
there
was
no
evidence
of
prolonged
questioning.
now,
we
have
questioning
here
of
only
at
the
most
three
and
half
hours.
and
i
think
this
court,
as
many
other
courts
have
recognized
that
interrogation
is
one
way
to
get
information
and
the
interrogation
itself
is
not
prohibited.
and
we
feel
that
three
and
a
half
hours
at
a
time
with
ample
time
in
between
for
rest
include
sleep
is
not
prolonged
questioning.
now
also,
you've
pointed
out
in
brown
and
allen
--
against
allen,
there
were
no
promises
of
reward
and
he
was
not
denied
counsel
of
his
choice,
the
same
applies
here,
we
believe,
where
testimony
before
each
confession
that
they
didn't
promise
him
anything,
didn't
offer
any
reward
so
forth
and
that
he
apparently
didn't
ask
the
counsel
because
none
was
denied
and
he
wasn't,
if
he
did,
he
didn't
appear.
the
court
held
in
brown
against
allen
of
course
that
the
mere
detention
by
police
officers,
which
we
have
here,
didn't
render
the
statement
that
he
made
involuntary.
turning
then
to
gallegos
against
nebraska,
there
we
had
a
--
a
38-year-old
mexican
--
mr.
robert
straub
yes.
mr.
robert
straub
he
was
illiterate,
yes.
i
don't
recall
whether
--
mr.
robert
straub
yes,
sir,
but
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
this
feature
of
--
of
our
case.
he
had
his
mother
testify
that
he
was
thickheaded
or
--
perhaps
it
was
his
father.
you
have
the
fact
that
he
was
somewhere
around
16
when
he
left
the
third
grade.you
have
a
testimony
by
three
psychiatrists
that
he
is
a
schizophrenic
or
some
sort
of
--
of
character.
however,
those
three
psychiatrists
examined
him
for
two
hours.
they
had
no
background
from
which
to
draw
the
conclusions
other
than
what
they
asked
the
petitioner
himself
and
what
he
told
them
and
as
one
of
them
said
a
brief
conversation
with
the
father.
you
get
the
background.
now,
it
may
be
that
a
person
could
be
so
insane
that
a
psychiatrist
can
look
at
him
and
talk
to
him
for
two
hours
and
definitely
make
up
his
mind,
but
this
man
was
holding
a
job
in
the
service
station
and
worked
there
for
a
number
of
years,
worked
there
all
day,
servicing
cars,
greasing
and
cleaning
oil
and
so
forth.
and
further
as
evidence
we
think
of
--
or
perhaps
the
cursory
nature
of
their
investigation
of
the
defendant
or
petitioner,
it
was
brought
out
that
he
had
stolen
some
automobile
tires
a
year
or
so
or
several
years
ago
shortly
after
the
war.
the
psychiatrist
rather
than
even
apparently
considering
the
fact
that
that
might
be
some
indication
of
criminal
bent
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner,
just
assumed
that
that
was
the
time
he
broke
this
behavior
pattern
and
that
he
was
crazy
from
that
time
on.
and
so,
we
think
that
the
--
although
the
state
put
on
no
countering
testimony
as
to
whether
or
not
he
was
sane
or
insane,
that
the
evidence
doesn't
show
that
he
was
completely
insane
as
is
alleged
and
assumed
here.
mr.
robert
straub
no,
sir.
i
don't
believe
they
did.
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
record
and
to
my
personal
knowledge,
i'm
just
not
sure.
mr.
robert
straub
yes,
sir.
not
guilty
and
not
--
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity,
both.
mr.
robert
straub
the
verdict
in
alabama
does
not
specify.
it
just
says
guilty
or
not
guilty.
now,
this
of
course
came
in
the
verdict
of
guilt.
mr.
robert
straub
they
find
him,
as
i
recall,
guilty
by
a
reason
of
insanity
and
therefore
he
is
placed
not
guilty
--
excuse
me,
by
reason
of
sanity
and
therefore,
he
is
then
committed
to
an
institution.
mr.
robert
straub
yes.
mr.
robert
straub
well
--
mr.
robert
straub
we
recognize
the
different
types,
your
honor
either
--
mr.
robert
straub
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
robert
straub
it
can
be
upon
motion,
yes,
sir.
it
can
--
the
pretrial
motion
can
be
and
it
--
or
can
come
up
at
the
trial.
mr.
robert
straub
it
did.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
straub
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
straub
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
straub
no,
sir.
i
don't
believe
they
did.
there's
none
in
the
printed
record
and
i
--
i've
forgotten
whether
there's
any
in
the
--
it
was
not
any
professional,
if
there
was
any,
there
were
no
professional
--
mr.
robert
straub
yes,
sir.
they
cross-examined
to
the
extent,
how
long
did
you
--
mr.
robert
straub
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
straub
mostly
was
rested
on
that.
in
gallegos
against
nebraska,
we
have
the
38-year-old
mexican
farm
man
who
can't
read
or
write
english.
now,
he
was
picked
up
in
texas
of
course.
and
he
was
held
for
a
number
of
days
with
questioning
until
he
finally
confessed.
he
was
held
from
september
19th
until
the
23rd
in
fact.
and
during
this
time,
he
was
not
brought
before
a
magistrate
and
in
fact,
he
was
held
in
under
much
more
severe
circumstances
than
our
petitioner
here.
there
was
testimony
that
one
of
the
cells
he
was
kept
in
had
no
bed,
another
one
had
no
light,
and
he
was
given
maybe
one
meal
a
day
and
also
that
he
was
threatened
with
violence.
and
then
after
he
had
confessed
in
texas,
he
was
sent
to
nebraska
and
where
he
confessed
shortly,
a
day
or
two
after
he
arrived
and
then
about
12
or
13
days
later,
was
finally
taken
before
a
magistrate
after
he
had
confessed
twice
on
each
state.
mr.
robert
straub
yes,
sir,
he
had
--
mr.
robert
straub
no,
sir.
there
were
some
questioning
--
mr.
robert
straub
i
can't
answer
that
question,
your
honor.
i'd
have
to
ask
counsel.
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
record.
mr.
robert
straub
i
understand
that
his
first
counsel
were
appointed
at
arraignment
under
the
circumstances
that
alabama's
court
does
appoint
counsel
and
will
appoint
him
throughout
an
appeal
if
--
in
capital
cases
under
our
automatic
appeal
statute.
apparently
he
later
retained
counsel.
mr.
robert
straub
well,
sir,
it
--
he
was
picked
up
on
september.
mr.
robert
straub
yes.
mr.
robert
straub
no,
sir.
the
act
occurred
in
april.
mr.
robert
straub
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
straub
it
all
depends
in
alabama,
your
honor,
on
where
the
circuit
is
sitting
at
a
particular
time.
now,
the
selma
circuit
--
i've
forgotten
how
many
counties
are
in
there,
but
it
is
a
--
several
counties.
if
it
happens
to
be
that
it's
sitting
in
that
county
at
that
time
then
it's
quick.
if
it's
not,
it
waits
until
it
gets
around
until
the
proper
time.
also
in
lisenba
against
california,
there
of
course
we
had
the
businessman
who
attempted
or
who
did
or
hired
of
some
sort
the
procured
murder
of
his
wife.
now
there,
he
wasn't
questioned
for
many
--
very
many
days
at
the
time,
but
he
was
questioned
beginning
one
day
and
questioned
all
that
day,
all
that
night,
and
all
the
following
day
and
the
following
night
until
3
o'clock
in
the
morning
when
he
either
fainted
or
fell
asleep
and
they
dropped
him
for
a
while.
and
after
an
accomplice
had
confessed,
they
took
him
back
again
and
questioned
him
all
day
and
into
about
the
middle
of
the
night,
in
fact,
took
him
away
from
the
--
from
the
jail,
took
him
away
from
prison
back
to
his
home
to
question
him.
and
then
in
the
middle
of
the
night,
he
said
if
they'd
give
him
something
to
eat,
he
would
talk
and
he
was
provided
with
food
and
he
did
talk.
now
we
contend
that
in
turner
against
commonwealth,
which
is
relied
upon
by
the
petitioners
here
to
a
great
extent
that
the
differentiating
quality
here
is
that
in
turner,
you
had
the
relay
technique
employed.
they
kept
the
man
right
there
where
the
officers
were
working
and
every
time
anyone
of
them
had
any
free
time,
he
called
in
the
petitioner,
the
defendant
in
that
case
in
question,
and
they
kept
that
up.
now
here,
the
officers
had
to
drive
about
50
miles
to
go
--
to
see
the
petitioner,
to
question
him.
now,
turning
now
to
the
question
of
his
testimony
whether
or
not
he
should
have
been
permitted
to
testify
on
voir
dire
without
submitting
himself
to
cross-examination.
now,
first
of
all,
as
your
honors
know,
this
court
has
often
held
that
the
first
eight
amendments
are
not
to
be
protect
--
are
not
protected
by
the
fourteenth
in
the
--
in
the
action
by
the
state,
unless,
you
get
to
that
lack
of
fundamental
justice.
in
fact,
in
twining
against
new
jersey
which
went
into
the
--
the
question
of
the
right
to
remain
silent
or
the
right
to
testify,
the
court
held
that
the
inference
is
irresistible
that
it
has
been
the
opinion
of
constitution
makers
that
the
privilege
if
fundamental
in
any
sense
is
not
fundamental
in
due
process
of
law
nor
essential
part
of
it.
mr.
robert
straub
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
straub
no,
sir.
no.
the
objection
was
to
the
effect
that
they
wanted
to
show,
they
wanted
to
put
him
on
for
the
purpose
of
refuting
certain
allegations.
mr.
robert
straub
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
straub
certain
testimony
regarding
the
voluntary
character
of
the
--
of
the
confessions.
i
did
not
say
in
what
manner
they
wanted
to
attack
it.
mr.
robert
straub
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
straub
and
that
question
was
raised
as
to
the
practice
of
alabama.
there's
no
statute
on
it.
it's
more
or
less
a
matter
of
discretion.
i
guess
it's
often
heard
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
and
sometimes
without
the
presence
of
the
jury.
mr.
robert
straub
it
was
in
the
presence
of
the
jury.
mr.
robert
straub
the
judge
rules
on
admissibility
and
the
jury
takes
the
same
or
they
repeat
the
testimony
or
put
other
testimony
on
for
the
purpose
of
credibility
and
weight
to
be
given.
mr.
robert
straub
i
don't
know
what
--
whether
there
is
any
--
as
you
say,
practice.
i
--
i
think
it's
discretionary
to
the
judge
whether
they
do
it
as
a
matter
of
course
all
the
time
or
not,
i
--
i'm
just
not
in
position
to
answer
that
question.
mr.
robert
straub
as
was
stated
by
counsel
for
petitioner,
there
was
a
request
that
the
jury
be
excluded.
mr.
robert
straub
and
the
jury
was
excluded.
and
then
they
had
a
--
a
conference
of
some
sort
which
is
not
reported
in
the
record.
i
don't
know
what
it
was
about,
but
they
had
a
conference
right
before
that.
then
the
jury
came
back
in.
the
state
made
its
offer
of
the
confession
and
without
any
further
objection
to
the
jury
being
there,
the
objection
was
raised,
the
offer
was
made
to
put
the
defendant
on.
the
jury
was
excluded
and
then
came
back
in
and
there
wasn't
any
objection
at
that
point
of
getting
him
back
out
again
or
any
request
putting
them
back.
mr.
robert
straub
to
this
extent,
your
honor,
the
officers
had
--
had
testified
that
they
had
offered
him
no
--
mr.
robert
straub
yes.
mr.
robert
straub
it
--
it
took
place
in
this
manner,
your
honor.
i
have
it
here,
230.
i
think
we
can
explain
it,
page
230
of
the
--
of
the
printed
record.
attorney
hall
on
cross-examination
says,
“that
is
all.”
he's
cross-examining
one
of
the
police
officers
about
to
introduce
the
confession
and
the
--
the
court
solicitor
here
says
the
state
offers
an
evidence,
a
recording.
and
if
the
court
please,
the
defendant
objects
to
what
purpose
to
be
the
recording
made
by
this
witness
on
the
ground
that
sufficient
predicate
had
not
been
laid
and
they
overrule
the
objection.
and
then
they
--
they
go
through
this
colloquy
which
we
testified
about
it.
apparently,
it
doesn't
appear
here
that
the
--
the
jury
did
go
out
at
one
time
but
i
think
it
appears
in
the
--
on
190
as
counsel
has
so
helpfully
provided
here.
i
knew
it
was
either
here
or
in
the
preliminary
or
the
full
record,
which
is
not
before
this
court.
when
was
that
particular
recording
made?
talking
about
the
one
which
was
subsequently
introduced.
if
your
honor
please,
we're
going
to
ask
the
court
to
exclude
the
jury
at
this
time.
and
that's
on
190,
and
they
did
excuse
the
jury
at
that
time.
mr.
robert
straub
yes.
mr.
robert
straub
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
straub
yes,
it
was
in
the
jury,
sir,
the
offer
was
in
the
jury's
hearing.
mr.
robert
straub
yes,
sir.
now
in
alabama
and
a
few
--
mr.
robert
straub
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
straub
page
what?
mr.
robert
straub
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
straub
yes.
mr.
robert
straub
well,
sir,
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
straub
jury
retired
from
the
jury
room,
near
the
bottom,
attorney
hall
and
solicitor
hare
confer
with
the
court.
mr.
robert
straub
then
take
a
10-minute
recess,
stand
in
recess,
captain
baker
returns
to
the
witness
stand
and
they
go
on.
mr.
robert
straub
yes,
sir.
during
the
--
the
conference
that
they
had
--
mr.
robert
straub
well,
we
don't
know.
mr.
robert
straub
there's
no
further
--
there's
no
--
no
exception
or
exception
to
the
court's
ruling,
it
appears.
mr.
robert
straub
under
a
very
recent
statute,
and
i'm
sorry
i
can't
tell
you
whether
it's
before
or
after
this
case
was
tried,
you
do
not,
and
i
believe
frankly
that
it
was
after
this
case
was
tried
that
that
came
in.
i
--
i
can't
be
certain
on
that.
mr.
robert
straub
but
you
do
not
anymore
have
to
take
an
exemption.
in
alabama
of
course,
a
--
under
our
constitutional
provisions,
an
accused
may
remain
silent
or
even
elect
to
testify.
and
if
he
remained
silent,
you
can't
make
any
reference
to
it
in
the
argument
and
it's
not
supposed
to
be
the
basis
for
any
inference
of
guilt.
we've
held
in
the
long
number
of
cases
that
in
alabama
that
if
he
does
elect
to
testify
that
he
takes
the
stand
as
any
other
defendant
does
and
that
he
thereby
opens
himself
up
--
mr.
robert
straub
no,
sir.
not
where
he
has
requested
a
limited
to
--
limited
to
the
extent
of
--
of
this
particular
question.
now,
we've
had
where
he's
asked
to
testify
only
on
certain
phases
of
his
case
--
mr.
robert
straub
--
the
alibi
or
something
--
mr.
robert
straub
yes.
but
never
to
where
he
has
asked
in
this
particular
instant.
but
we
have
the
line
of
cases
and
i
think
this
court
has
also
laid
down
such
a
line
of
cases
that
when
a
defendant
takes
the
stand,
even
though
he
has
a
constitutional
right
not
to
be
called
upon
to
testify
against
himself,
that
once
he
takes
the
stand,
he
does
so
as
any
other
defendant.
mr.
robert
straub
yes.
mr.
robert
straub
yes.
mr.
robert
straub
yes.
mr.
robert
straub
i
should
like,
your
honor,
to
present
some
what
we
consider
authority
on
that
point
at
least.
turning
first
to
adamson
against
california,
now
there,
you
had
the
california
statute
involved
which
permitted
a
comment
on
the
failure
to
testify.
and
the
court
brought
up
this
--
this
particular
statement.
we're
talking
about
the
--
the
choice
that
any
defendant
has
to
make
between
testifying
and
remaining
silent.
and
they
say
that
it's
a
dilemma
which
any
defendant
might
be
faced
with.
if
facts
adversed
to
the
defendant
are
proven
by
the
prosecution,
there
may
be
--
don't
know
a
way
to
explain
them
favorably
to
the
accused
except
by
a
witness
who
may
be
vulnerable
to
impeachment
on
cross-examination.
the
defendant
must
then
decide
whether
or
not
to
use
such
as
a
witness.
the
fact
that
the
witness
may
also
be
the
defendant
makes
the
choice
more
difficult,
but
a
denial
of
due
process
does
not
emerge
from
the
circumstances.
now
there,
we
are
talking
about
perhaps
merits,
probably
merits,
but
turning
to
witt
against
united
states,
a
circuit
court
of
appeals
case,
there,
the
trial
judge
heard
evidence
concerning
admissibility
in
the
absence
of
the
--
of
the
jury
and
they
came
back
in
and
they
had
the
same
testimony
over
again.
and
a
--
at
the
--
after
the
second
attempt
of
his
testimony,
the
--
the
judge
at
first
of
course
had
ruled
his
confession
was
voluntary
then
they
came
back
in
and
the
witness
for
the
government
testified
again.
on
appeal,
the
defendant
claimed
that
he
wasn't
permitted
to
testify
to
the
voluntary
aspect
of
his
conversation.
that
was
his
basis
of
appeal.
he
said,
“i
wasn't
allowed
to
testify.”
and
the
court
after
reading
the
record
said
this,
“we
don't
read
it
that
way.”
he
was
permitted
to
testify
all
right
if
he
wanted
to,
but
the
court
went
no
further
than
to
suggest
that
if
appellant
testified,
he
would
have
subject
himself
to
cross-examination.
and
the
court
goes
further
to
say
that
the
appellant
was
obviously
afraid
to
take
the
stand
and
speak
concerning
anything
material
matter
inquired
of
him
by
his
counsel.
he
could
not
well
ask
that
the
court
guarantee
him
in
advance
that
he
would
be
asked
no
embarrassing
questions
on
cross-examination
if
he
did
do
--
did
so.
if
he
had
taken
the
stand
and
the
court
had
permitted
undue
latitude
in
his
cross
examination,
he
would
have
had
something
to
complain
about
and
that's
what
we
--
position
we
take
here,
that
he
can't
--
mr.
robert
straub
the
raffle?
well
there,
the
federal
agent
testified
to
certain
admissions
of
the
defendant
on
a
trial
and
the
defendant
didn't
testify
at
all,
and
the
trial
resulted
in
a
hung
jury.
there
was
no
verdict.
so
they
go
into
trial
again
and
the
agent
gave
the
same
testimony
and
the
defendant
in
that
trial
took
the
stand
and
denied
the
statements.
and
so
they
began
to
cross-examine
him
and
court
itself
just
asking
why
he
--
why
he
didn't
testify
on
the
trial
before.
and
then
the
court
and
--
came
to
this
court
and
you
--
this
--
this
court
stated
the
question
as
follow.
was
it
error
to
require
the
defendant
wrap
it,
offering
himself
as
a
witness
upon
the
second
trial
to
dispose
that
he
had
not
testified
as
a
witness
in
his
own
behalf
upon
the
first
trial.
and
you,
your
honors
came
to
this
conclusion
that
a
waiver
of
his
right
not
to
testify
is
not
partial.
having
once
cast
aside
the
cloak
of
immunity,
he
may
not
resume
it
at
will
whenever
cross-examination
may
be
inconvenient
or
embarrassed.
we
may
not
--
we
need
not
close
our
eyes
to
the
fact
that
every
person
accused
of
crime
is
under
some
pressure
to
testify
less
the
jury
despite
his
carefully
framed
instructions
drawn
on
favorable
inference
and
so
forth.
when
he
does
take
the
stand,
he
is
under
the
same
pressure
to
testify
fully
rather
than
avail
himself
on
a
partial
immunity.
and
goes
on
to
state
that
the
protection
is
not
to
be
now
and
then
drop
and
then
pick
up
again
throughout
the
trial.
this
was
a
trial
of
course
in
the
federal
court
involving
the
federal
constitution
and
the
right
not
to
be
required
to
testify
against
yourself.
mr.
robert
straub
no
sir.
mr.
robert
straub
sir,
i
think
the
difference
is
this.
in
the
question
that
you
put
has
nothing
to
do
with
anything
that
has
been
placed
in
evidence.
now
here
we
have
testimony.
we
don't
have
the
confession
placed
in
evidence
yet.
mr.
robert
straub
no,
sir.
but
you
have
testimony
that
during
his
incarceration,
a
tape
recording
was
obtained.
now,
he
wants
to
come
in
and
say,
"wait
a
minute.
this
was
obtained
under
such
and
such
circumstances."
now
in
a
trial
of
a
coercion
issue,
even
though
it's
the
judge
who
has
to
make
the
determination,
we
contend
that
the
credibility
if
nothing
else
of
the
petitioner
is
something
that
the
judge
wants
to
know
about.
it's
going
to
be
his
word
against
the
officer's
word
and
as
this
court
in
some
case
rather
said
that
coercion
is
as
often
falsely
asserted
as
it
is
falsely
denied.
now
we
feel
that
--
let's
--
let
him
get
at
the
credibility
at
least
then
if
they
step
outside
the
bounds
of
something
that
hasn't
been
put
in
evidence
yet.
and
there
was
some
of
the
main
case
which
wasn't
put
in
evidence
yet
this
time.
you
had
the
testimony
of
the
prosecutrix.
he
did
not
have
the
testimony
of
the
other
two
women
who
testified
they
found
him
in
their
apartment
those
other
times,
so
they
couldn't
question
him
on
that.
but
what
i'm
saying
is
certainly
the
judge
himself
should
be
permitted
to
get
at
least
the
testimony
concerning
the
credibility
of
the
defendant.
mr.
robert
straub
yes.
mr.
robert
straub
that's
right.
he
didn't
--
mr.
robert
straub
that's
right.
that's
--
that's
correct.
but
we're
saying
he
should
at
least
have
that
aspect
of
it
then
if
he
goes
beyond
what
this
court
may
subsequently
determine
is
legal
or
proper
then
there
is
something
to
complain
about.
mr.
robert
straub
under
alabama
law,
it
apparently
wouldn't
make
any
difference,
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
straub
well,
sir,
now,
the
defendant
--
the
jury
is
called
upon
to
determine
or
weigh
the
credibility
then
to
be
given.
mr.
robert
straub
that's
true,
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
straub
yes,
sir,
but
let's
assume
that
the
judge
hears
testimony
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
concerning
--
concerning
admissibility
where
the
defendant
testifies
to
acts
of
coercions,
supposed
acts
of
coercion
and
the
jury
hears
it.
they
can
use
that
same
testimony
in
their
deliberations
as
to
--
and
the
judge
says
it
wasn't.
so
let's
assume
that
the
judge
says
it
wasn't
coerced
and
we
let
it
in.
mr.
robert
straub
the
jury
can
still
use
--
mr.
robert
straub
that
they
were
not
--
mr.
robert
straub
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
straub
that's
true.
mr.
robert
straub
then
there
is
no
further
recourse.
mr.
robert
straub
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
straub
it
could
be
heard
before
the
judge
and
often
is
when
it's
requested
but
is
--
doesn't
--
there's
no
statute
that
says
it
has
to
be
before
the
judge
or
anything
of
that
sort.
if
your
honors
will
permit,
i
would
like
now
to
briefly
state
the
--
our
provision
--
our
quotation
of
the
stein
case
and
then
jump
toward
the
--
in
the
few
remaining
minutes
to
the
question
of
the
negroes
on
the
jury.
mr.
robert
straub
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
straub
your
honor,
i
know
of
none.
mr.
robert
straub
no,
sir.
there
are
none
in
alabama.
they
point
actually
except
for
witt
in
the
circuit
court
and
stein
--
mr.
robert
straub
it
has
--
it
is
arisen,
but
is
--
has
never
--
except
for
witt
and
stein
actually
been
determined
as
i
can
see
it.
mr.
robert
straub
there
may
--
there
may
be,
your
honor,
and
there
is
i'm
sure
in
louisiana
and
maybe
some
state
adjudications
on
it,
but
federal
to
my
knowledge
has
not
directly
decided
the
point.
mr.
robert
straub
sir,
i
don't
know.
stein
against
new
york,
the
defendants
complain
that
they
weren't
allowed
to
take
the
stand
and
to
testify
the
coercion
because
they
would
submit
themselves
to
cross-examination.
now,
this
court
in
discussing
the
stein
case
said
we're
not
--
it
didn't
properly
preserve.
it
didn't
--
they
didn't
make
any
offer
to
testify,
but
went
on
further
to
discuss
the
matter.
you
thought
enough
of
it
to
discuss
it
in
this
light
that
if
they
had
given
such
testimony,
it
would
have
been
in
direct
conflict
with
that
of
the
police
and
the
decision
would
depend
on
which
was
believable.
certainly,
the
constitution
does
not
prohibit
test
of
credibility
which
american
law
uniformly
applies
to
witnesses.
if
an
open
court,
free
from
violence
or
threat
of
it,
defendants
who'd
been
obliged
to
admit
incriminating
facts,
it
might
bear
on
the
credibility
of
their
claim
that
the
same
facts
were
admitted
to
the
police
only
in
response
to
a
beating.
in
the
trial
and
skipping
then
on
down,
in
trial
of
a
coercion
issue
as
of
every
other
issue
on
the
prosecution
has
made
a
case
to
go
to
the
jury,
an
accused
must
choose
between
the
disadvantage
from
silence
and
that
to
testify.
the
constitution
safeguards
the
right
of
the
defendant
to
remain
silent.
it
does
not
assure
in
the
--
may
remain
silent
and
still
enjoy
the
advantages
that
might
result
of
them
testifying
and
that's
what
we're
saying
here,
your
honors,
that
he's
trying
--
trying
to
take
advantage
of
two
constitutional
safeguards.
he's
trying
to
take
advantage
of
the
right
to
remain
silent
so
he
won't
be
cross
examined.
at
the
same
time,
he's
trying
to
take
advantage
of
the
right
to
be
heard
and
we
feel
that
this
court
in
the
cases
which
it
has
decided
and
the
constitution
itself
does
not
guarantee
to
any
individual
those
two
safeguards
at
the
same
time.
mr.
robert
straub
yes,
sir.
that
is
--
mr.
robert
straub
there's
a
third.
mr.
robert
straub
by
using,
your
honor,
a
third
guarantee
of
remaining
silent.
mr.
robert
straub
turning
now
to
the
--
shortly
to
the
motion
to
quash,
it's
true
and
it's
recognized
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
that
for
many
years
there
were
no
negroes
that
ever
served
on
a
grand
jury
or
a
petit
jury
in
alabama.
but
we
have
the
proposition
where
in
response
to
a
motion
to
quash,
an
indictment
was
quashed
and
the
entire
jury
box
thrown
out
and
the
jury
commissioners
instructed
to
refill
the
box,
which
they
did.
the
testimony
shows
that
prior
to
this
time,
it
might
have
been
30
names
and
it
goes
in
the
box
in
about
1200
or
so
white
people.
now
we
have
testimony
concerning
that
it
contains
about
250
to
300
names
of
negroes
and
about
1500
--
excuse
me
--
white
people.
now,
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
drawing
the
grand
jury
for
this
particular
case,
it's
the
first
time
that
we
have
drawn
a
grand
jury
or
petit
jury
in
dallas
county,
alabama,
where
they
had
250
or
300
names
in
the
box.
so
you
don't
have
a
pattern
to
go
by
with
this
box
and
this
jury
and
this
indictment.
the
other
testimony
we
feel
should
--
to
be
disregarded
other
than
to
shed
light
on
what
used
to
be
the
practice
down
there.
i
bring
that
out
because
in
akins
against
texas,
one
of
the
cases
upon
which
we
rely
where
this
court
held,
again
that
numerical
and
mathematical
precision
is
not
necessary.
the
court
remarked
several
times
that
after
this
court
and
the
supreme
court
of
texas
had
reversed
a
number
of
cases
because
of
the
exclusion
--
systematic
exclusion
of
negroes
that
the
commissioners
were
obviously
trying
to
follow
the
mandate
of
this
court
and
the
supreme
court
of
texas
in
refilling
the
box
and
trying
to
do
what
the
law
of
the
united
states
and
that
the
state
required.
now,
we
don't
contend
that
mere
trying
is
enough.
but
we
do
say
this
that
this
effort
being
made
and
shown
to
have
been
made
by
the
jury
commissioners
of
dallas
county
certainly
shows
that
now,
there
is
no
planned
and
systematic
exclusion
of
negroes
on
the
jury
--
in
the
jury
box
of
dallas
county.
now,
this
court
has
held
that
in
examining
the
record
that
you're
going
to
give
some
great
weight
or
some
respect
to
the
findings
of
the
lower
court
in
respect
to
issues
such
as
this
unless
there's
no
evidence
to
support
the
findings
of
the
lower
court
and
we
submit
that
when
our
supreme
court
of
alabama
states
that
there
is
no
evidence
of
systematic
exclusion
apparent
in
the
record,
that
there
is
ample
evidence
to
back
that
statement
up.
now,
in
thomas
against
texas,
we
find
the
same
reflection
by
this
court
that
it
may
be
that
they
don't
have
the
full
pro
rata
with
the
white
race
in
the
selection
of
grand
and
petit
juries
in
this
case.
still
it
wouldn't
be
evidence
of
discrimination
if
they
fairly
and
honestly
endeavored
to
discharge
their
duty
and
did
not
in
fact
discriminate
then
no
right
has
been
denied.
and
we
feel
that
by
looking
at
the
testimony
of
all
the
jury
commissioners
and
the
clerk
of
the
jury
commission
that
were
before
the
trial
court,
the
court
can't
help
but
see
that
there
is
no
discrimination
being
practiced
now.
now,
something
was
said
about
whether
or
not
the
qualifications
of
the
negroes
would
explain
the
disproportionate
--
proportion
in
the
jury
box.
well
now,
we
feel
that
under
fay
against
new
york,
that
burden
rests
upon
the
petitioner
to
show
when
he
realized
on
figures
showing
that
there
are
so
many
negroes
and
so
many
whites
and
then
tries
to
say
that
because
of
that,
you
--
mr.
robert
straub
excuse
me,
your
honors.
mr.
robert
straub
if
--
if
your
--
because
of
that,
you
don't
have
enough
numerically
in
the
box
then
he
has
to
turn
around
and
show
that
numerically
they
are
qualified
in
such
a
position
and
we
think
fay
against
new
york
is
adequate
--
mr.
robert
straub
yes.
mr.
robert
straub
yes.
mr.
robert
straub
yes.
then
they
should
come
in
and
show
that
there
are
so
many
people
who
do
not
fall
within
our
statutory
exemption.
thank
you.
