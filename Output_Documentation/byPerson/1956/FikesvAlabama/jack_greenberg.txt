mr.
jack
greenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
petitioner,
having
asserted
in
the
courts
below
rights,
privileges
and
immunities
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
petitioner
has
been
sentenced
to
death
for
the
crime
of
burglary
in
the
first
degree,
it
being
in
the
first
degree,
because
he
allegedly
committed
with
intent
to
rape.
the
issues
in
the
case
are
principally
two.
the
first
issue
revolves
about
the
admissibility
of
a
confession
or
confessions
which
the
petitioner
alleges
were
coerced
from
him
in
violation
of
guarantees
conferred
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
related
to
this
principle
issue
of
the
confession
is
another
issue.
while
the
confession
was
in
the
process
of
being
qualified
to
be
admitted
into
evidence
as
voluntary,
the
petitioner
offered
to
take
the
stand
to
testify
concerning
the
voluntary
nature
of
the
confession
and
to
testify
towards
that
purpose
only.
the
state’s
attorney
objected
stating
that
if
the
petitioner
were
to
take
the
stand,
he
should
then
have
to
testify
not
only
as
to
voluntariness
but
--
but
as
to
--
as
he
said,
each
and
every
matter
in
evidence.
petitioner
claims
that
the
requirement
to
put
him
on
the
stand
and
require
him
to
testify
as
to
matters
as
to
which
he
would
otherwise
be
privileged
to
remain
silent,
prevented
him
from
establishing
the
involuntary
nature
of
the
confession
and
consequently
was
also
erroneous.
in
addition
to
this,
there
is
also
the
issue
of
whether
negroes
were
excluded
from
juries
in
dallas
county,
alabama
contrary
to
the
requirements
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution.
in
the
spring
of
1953,
there
were
a
series
of
burglaries,
rapes
and
robberies
in
dallas
county,
alabama,
particularly
in
the
city
of
selma.
among
the
victims
whose
home
was
burglarized
and
against
whom
there
was
an
attempt
to
rape
was
the
daughter
of
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
selma,
alabama.
the
chief
of
police
testified
that
this
crime
weight,
and
particularly
this
last
mentioned
crime,
placed
the
police
department
under
unusual
pressure.
and
indeed,
he
testified
that
they
had
never
seen
anything
like
that
before.
a
month
later,
it
was
reported
that
with
the
petitioner's
arrest,
the
docket
of
unsolved
burglaries
and
rapes
had
been
solved
and
that
petitioner
later
on
was
indicted
on
at
least
six
counts
of
which
this
particular
crime
was
won.
the
only
evidence
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
may
it
please
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
as
i
stated
before
lunch,
the
only
evidence
against
the
petitioner
to
establish
that
he
had
committed
this
crime
was
his
confession.
the
prosecutrix
had
testified
that
she
had
awakened
to
find
a
man
sitting
on
her
chest
and
he's
had
a
towel
draped
over
his
head
and
they've
had
a
lengthy
struggle
throughout
this
apartment
that
traveled
over
a
distance
more
than
40
feet
and
she
grabbed
the
knife
from
him
and
(inaudible)
from
the
apartment
but
she
was
never
able
to
identify
him.
and
consequently,
the
only
--
and
she
so
testified
at
the
trial.
the
only
evidence
against
the
petitioner
was
his
confession
with
this
exception.
as
i
stated,
petitioner
was
indicted
for
at
least
six
crimes
and
he
had
been
tried
for
another
one
prior
to
this.
the
one
which
he
had
been
tried
was
an
actual
case
of
rape,
not
attempted
rape,
but
this
one
was.
and
he
had
been
convicted
but
he
was
sentenced
merely
to
99
years
and
not
to
death.
in
this
case,
the
prosecutrix
who
had
testified
in
the
first
case
testified
in
this
case
to
the
effect
that
she
has
been
raped
as
evidence
of
the
fact
that
this
was
a
kind
of
man
who
would
commit
rapes
and
therefore,
the
burglary
was
with
intent
to
rape.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
a
negro,
27
years
of
age.
he
was
a
service
station
attendant.
he
had
entered
the
first
grade
when
he
was
eight
years
of
age
and
had
graduated
from
the
third
grade
when
he
was
16.
there
was
testimony,
if
i
may
quote,
that
he
was
"thickheaded"
and
three
psychiatrists
testified
that
he
was
severely,
mentally
ill
and
had
been
for
some
time
and
they
diagnosed
the
illness
as
something
in
the
nature
of
schizophrenia.
he
was
arrested
by
a
civilian,
not
a
police
officer,
while
walking
in
an
alley
in
a
so-called
white
section
of
selma
which
in
fact
is
about
a
block
or
so
from
the
so-called
negro
section.
and
while,
apparently
doing
nothing
illegal
whatsoever,
a
civilian
grabbed
him
and
with
three
other
white
men
stuck
him
in
an
automobile
to
awake
the
police
whom
they
--
whom
they
called.
the
police
took
him,
arrested
him
on
suspicion,
and
they
did
not
as
is
required
by
alabama
law
for
the
extraordinary
case
of
a
civilian
arrest,
they
did
not
take
him
before
a
magistrate
and
indeed,
this
is
not
only
required
by
the
alabama
law,
but
this
is
the
custom,
the
record
shows,
of
the
city
of
selma
when
a
man
is
arrested
within
the
city.
there
are
some
evidence
that
if
a
man
is
arrested
outside
of
a
city,
a
different
type
of
warrant
is
used
and
he
is
not
necessarily
taken
for
magistrate.
but
for
someone
in
the
shoes
of
petitioner,
not
only
the
law
but
the
custom
was
to
take
him
immediately
before
the
recorder.
he
was
arrested
on
a
few
minutes
after
midnight
on
a
sunday
and
although
shortly
after
his
arrest,
the
day
after,
he
saw
the
sheriff
of
another
county
and
his
employer,
for
what
purpose
is
not
stated.
he
was
--
the
following
day,
taken
to
kilby
state
prison,
a
distance
of
50
miles
from
selma
where
he
was
kept
as
the
warden
of
kilby
testified
a
“safe
keeper.”
and
as
a
“safe
keeper,”
the
warden
testified,
he
is
not
our
prisoner,
so
we
never
feel
like
we
can
let
anyone
see
him
without
getting
an
okay
from
the
man
who
was
charged
of
him.
if
a
man
does
identify
himself
as
a
lawyer,
we
will
do
it.
we
will
go
that
far.
but
the
record
shows
that
when
a
lawyer
came
to
see
the
petitioner
during
the
period
he
was
at
kilby,
he
was
not
permitted
to
see
him.
the
lawyer
came
there,
there's
no
evidence
that
he's
been
retained.
he
said
he'd
heard
of
the
case
and
he
wanted
to
see
petitioner
because
he
didn't
believe
he
was
guilty.
the
warden
testified
at
first
that
he
didn't
know
he
was
a
lawyer
and
then
he
admitted
that
he
did
know
he
was
a
lawyer.
then
he
said,
“well,
he
hadn't
given
me
his
address.”
and
then
when
finally
asked
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
given
me
his
address.
the
lawyer
hadn't
given
his
address.
he
did
testify
that
he
did
know
him
and
know
of
him.
and
then
finally,
he
said
that
--
when
asked
why
after
the
confession
a
lawyer
was
admitted
without
anymore
identification
or
anymore
question
and
during
this
period
of
time,
he
said
that
--
that
--
he
was
our
prisoner
then
and
we
can
let
him
see
anybody
we
like.
the
reason
for
taking
him
to
kilby
was
allegedly
for
protection,
for
safe
keeping.
but
the
record
shows
that
there
were
other
people
in
the
selma
jail
who
were
suspected
of
similar
crimes
and
there
were
no
more
reason
for
the
public
to
be
incensed
against
one
prisoner
than
against
another.
there
were
--
and
in
fact,
there
was
a
--
there
were
no
threats.
there
was
no
basis
for
believing
that
either
anybody
outside
of
the
jail
or
anyone
inside
the
jail
was
going
to
do
any
harm
to
the
petitioner.
when
he
was
taken
to
kilby,
he
was
kept
in
solitary.
the
word
was
"segregation"
but
at
any
rate,
he
was
kept
in
solitude
and
he
was
kept
there
for
at
least
a
period
of
10
days
during
which
10
days
he
rendered
the
two
confessions
that
are
at
issue
here.
during
the
first
five
days,
he
was
questioned
intermittently,
some
of
the
periods
of
questioning,
being
as
long
as
three
and
a
half
hours.
on
one
of
the
days,
he
was
not
questioned.
he
was
just
permitted
to
be
by
himself
in
his
solitary
cell.
at
the
end
of
five
days,
by
the
states'
own
testimony
and
its
own
admission,
he
was
questioned
a
minimum
of
20
hours.
mr.
jack
greenberg
there
is
no
evidence
of
brutality,
your
honor,
and
in
fact,
the
police
chief
who
questioned
him
stated
that
prior
to
commencing
each
question
in
session,
he
advised
the
prisoner
of
his
constitutional
rights
and
so
forth.
the
--
when
i
say
a
minimum
of
20
hours,
the
states'
testimony
is
in
such
term,
well
we
questioned
him
for
several
hours.
i
have
interpreted
several
as
two.
it
could
--
certainly
more
than
one
and
it
could
readily
be
in
--
well,
in
excess
of
two,
certainly
three
or
four,
but
i
have
made
the
minimum
interpretation
of
the
word
"several."
the
--
this
is
the
uncontradicted
testimony.
in
addition,
there
is
some
conflicting
testimony
that
one
questioning
session
was
at
least
nine
hours.
this
testimony
was
in
a
newspaper
story
in
the
selma
newspaper.
and
when
the
newspaper
left
and
took
the
stand,
he
testified
that
he
got
the
information
from
the
police
officers.
however,
later
on
in
the
trial
when
he
was
interrogated
by
the
state
on
this,
he
testified
that
he
had
just
made
the
figure
of
nine
hours
up
out
of
the
year.
but
the
non-conflicting
testimony
is
at
least
20
hours
during
this
period
of
time.
the
end
of
10
days
--
at
the
end
of
five
days,
one
confession
was
obtained
and
it
was
tape-recorded.
at
the
end
of
10
days,
another
confession
was
obtained
and
this
second
confession
was
obtained
again
on
the
basis
of
the
states'
testimony
following
at
least
27
hours.
that
is
not
27
hours
since
the
fifth
day,
but
from
the
first
day.
a
minimum,
at
least
27
hours
of
interrogation,
he
was
in
the
state
prison
at
that
point,
10
days.
on
thursday,
the
day
he
rendered
the
tape-recorded
confession,
his
father
drove
50
miles
to
kilby
to
see
him,
but
his
father
was
unable
to
see
him
on
thursday
and
finally
did
get
in
to
see
him
on
sunday
after
the
first
confession
but
before
the
second
confession.
the
state
appears
to
find
some
significance
in
the
fact
that
he
was
told
of
his
rights
before
each
session
or
at
least
so
the
--
so
the
police
officer
testified.
petitioner's
position
that
a
mere
pro
forma
recitation
of
constitutional
rights
to
a
petitioner
such
as
this
is
not
the
adequate
procedural
protection
that
the
constitution
requires.
i
believe
it
was
in
haley
versus
ohio
that
the
opinion
of
the
court
referred
to
such
a
merely
pro
forma
recitations
of
your
right
to
counsel
and
your
right
to
remain
silent
and
so
forth,
and
noting
that
in
the
absence
of
some
more
tangible
evidence
of
actual
protection
of
petitioner's
right,
such
as
taking
him
before
a
magistrate
and
so
forth
as
required
by
law.
well,
that
was
--
did
not
remove
the
evidence,
the
conclusion
of
coercion.
in
addition
to
which,
this
petitioner,
a
graduate
of
the
third
grade
at
age
16
and
at
least
severely
mentally
ill,
is
not
a
person
who
could
be
deemed
to
be
adequately
protected
by
a
recitation
to
him
by
a
police
officer
what
his
constitutional
rights
were.
in
summary,
on
this
particular
point
of
the
confession
issue,
we
have
a
case
in
which
the
prosecutrix
was
the
daughter
of
a
very
important
person
in
the
community,
the
mayor's
daughter.
the
police
testified
that
they
were
under
unusual
pressure
to
solve
the
crimes.
the
petitioner
is
a
negro.
he
was
obviously
terrified
by
the
civilian
arrest.
if
one
is
frightened
by
an
arrest
by
the
police,
at
least
there
is
the
thought
that
perhaps
he'll
be
brought
to
a
police
station
and
things
will
then
start
running
there
in
normal
and
proper
course
but
i
--
a
civilian
arrest
that
petitioner
submits
is
a
far
more
terrifying
experience.
he
was
arrested
originally
on
suspicion.
either
there
was
no
compliance
with
the
alabama
law
or
in
indeed
the
custom
of
the
city
of
selma.
he
was
driven
out
to
the
state
penitentiary,
where
--
were
not
being
interrogated.
he
was
kept
in
solitary
and
he
was
questioned
from
20
to
27
hours
prior
to
the
first
and
second
confessions
respect
--
respectively.
and
as
--
not
mute,
but
really
articulate
evidence
of
the
--
the
nature
of
this
confession,
we
can
really
turn
to
the
confession
itself.
and
on
page
233
of
the
record,
there
is
--
commencing
on
232,
there
is
the
tape-recorded
confession
taken
at
kilby,
the
first
one
after
the
fifth
day.
and
there's
the
captain
of
the
police
force
interrogating
the
petitioner.
and
at
about
the
eighth
or
ninth
line
down,
the
captain
says,
“now,
how
did
you
get
into
that
house,
william?”
and
william
says,
“er,
i
went
around
to
the
side
window
and
took
a
piece
of
wire
and
open
the
screen
and
come
through
that.
and
the
captain
says,
“in
what
kind
of
room
were
you
in
then?”
and
he
hesitates
and
says,
“i
was
in
a
--
er.
“at
this
point,
if
i
may
interpolate,
it's
essential
to
the
state's
case
to
show
he
came
into
the
bedroom
window
because
the
bedroom
window
is
the
window
through
which
the
prosecutrix
testified
the
entry
was
made.
and
so
he
says
--
repeats
again
after
the
petitioner
hesitates,
“what
kind
of
room
was
it,
william?
do
you
remember?”
and
he
begins
to
say,
“i
was
in
the
kitchen.”
he
says
a
part
of
the
word
kitchen,
but
he
doesn't
get
the
word
out
entirely.
and
the
police
officer
says,
“in
a
bedroom
with
a
child?”
and
the
petitioner
queries
bedroom
and
then
the
captain
of
police
goes
on
as
if
it
were
a
bedroom
saying,
“now,
who
was
in
that
bedroom,
william?”
and
then
william
repeats,
“the
baby,”
and
so
forth
and
the
confession
goes
on.
petitioner
submits
that
in
the
light
of
all
the
circumstances
that
have
been
related
that
is
persuasive
evidence
of
the
coerciveness
of
the
confession.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
they
were
--
he
was
asked
this
--
police
officer
was
asked
that
and
he
just
said
he
thought
he'd
better
get
another
confession.
the
second
confession,
just
merely
assumes
bedroom.
he
doesn't
ask
him
where
he
went
into.
the
second
confession
is
on
page
259
--
on
261,
about
halfway
down
the
page.
page
--
on
folio,
towards
this
folio
612,
there's
some
ambiguity
as
to
how
he
got
into
the
house
but
it
appears
that
he's
trying
to
say
he
went
in
through
a
kitchen
and
about
two
lines
beneath
the
numeral
612,
he
says,
“now
williams,
the
window
you
went
into
the
house,
was
it
a
bedroom?”
and
he
said,
“yes,
sir.”
and
i
might
add
that
the
entire
confessions
in
both
cases,
this
is
only
some
evidence,
coerced,
and
consist
of
answers
to
leading
questions,
yes
or
no
sir,
yes
or
no
sir.
apart
from,
i'd
say,
about
a
fifth
of
them
consist
of
--
of
just
recitations.
now,
i
told
you
your
rights
and
i
haven't
been
questioning
you
for
very
long
and
you've
been
treated
nicely
and
so
forth.
but
the
first
confession
of
course
is
quite
explicit.
it's
the
way
the
words
were
literally
put
in
the
man's
mouth.
now,
respondent
cites
a
number
of
cases
in
its
brief
in
an
effort
to
distinguish
this
case
from
the
rules
that
had
been
laid
down
by
this
court
and
i
believe
we
have
shown
in
our
reply
brief
that
those
cases
really
are
in
apposite.
i
may
mention
them
just
briefly.
there's
the
gallegos
case
in
which
the
nebraska
confession
was
given
instantaneously
upon
coming
into
the
custody
of
nebraska
and
the
texas
confession,
which
some
members
of
this
court
thought
wasn't
inapplicable
was
rendered
after,
i
think,
four
days
of
questioning.
after
four
days
of
imprisonment,
there
was
questioning
on
two
days
of
an
hour
to
each.
stein
case,
there
was
a
questioning
span,
32
hours.
in
the
stein
case,
the
defendants
were
--
this
court
held
hardened
criminals
who
during
the
give
and
take
of
the
confession
gave
very
adequate
evidence
of
their
ability
to
take
care
of
their
rights
as
a
reference
to
the
--
the
bargain
they
were
driving
to
--
before
they
agree
to
confess.
mr.
jack
greenberg
he
has
a
previous
record.
i
think
he
was
picked
up
for
stealing
some
automobile
tires
although
he
was
allegedly
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no
major
violations,
larceny
of
some
tire.
is
that,
right?
mr.
jack
greenberg
this--
in
stroble
against
california,
the
confession
also
was
given
in
stentor.
in
brown
versus
allen,
there
was
no
evidence
of
prolonged
interrogation.
and
in
the
lisenba
case,
it
was
noted
that
the
defendant
was
a
man
of
business
experience.
again,
these
people
are
--
who
are
either
not
questioned
to
a
great
an
extent
or
certainly
not
as
terrified
and
incapable
of
taking
care
of
their
rights
as
you
would
assume
this
petitioner
here
would
be.
petitioner
recognizes
that
in
these
cases,
this
court
does
not
add
up
a
calculation
of
days
and
hours
or
--
and
qualifications
and
so
forth.
it's
not
merely
quantitative
but
it's
a
qualitative
evaluation.
but
there
is
a
case
which
just
so
happens
involves
a
--
a
similar
defendant
and
a
similar
number
of
hours
and
similar
number
of
days
and
that's
cited
in
our
brief,
it's
turner
versus
pennsylvania.
there
was
five
days
in
about
20
some
odd
hours.
in
the
companion
case
of
johnson,
which
this
court
reversed
the
next
term,
summarily
involved,
i
think
only
six
hours
during
that
same
period
of
five
days.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
--
i
perhaps
wasn't
clear.
he
was
picked
up
on
where
--
at
least
six
different
crimes.
he
was
tried
for
one
of
them
before
he
was
tried
for
this
case.
in
that
first
case,
the
prosecutrix
testified
that
she
had
been
raped
and
he
was
convicted
and
he
was
sentenced
not
to
death
as
had
been
requested
by
the
state
but
to
99
years.
now
in
this
case,
which
involves
burglary
with
attempt
to
rape,
there's
no
charge
of
rape
in
this
case.
the
only
other
testimony
apart
from
the
confession
is
the
testimony
of
the
prosecutrix
in
the
first
case,
now
being
used
here
to
get
the
death
penalty
they
couldn't
get
in
the
first
case.
to
the
effect
that
this
is
the
kind
of
man
who
commits
rapes
and
therefore,
when
he
invaded
the
house
then
he
did
it
with
intent
to
rape
and
therefore,
it's
burglary
in
the
first
degree.
that's
what
i
--
just
trying
to
place
the
case
in
its
setting.
now,
petitioner
submits
that
the
confession
in
this
case
is
a
confession
that
on
the
states'
own
uncontradicted
testimony.
it's
a
matter
of
law
has
--
has
been
and
should
be
held
coerced
by
this
court.
but
we
have
more
in
this
case.
there,
the
petitioner
offered
to
take
the
stand
on
page
230
of
the
record
to
testify
as
to
the
admissibility,
the
admissibility
of
the
confession
into
evidence
and
his
counsel
said,
"we
would
like
to
make
an
offer
to
put
this
defendant
on
the
stand
for
the
purpose
of
refuting
certain
allegations
by
the
state
with
reference
to
the
voluntary
nature
of
what
purports
to
be
certain
extrajudicial
admissions
and
for
no
other
purpose.”
mr.
jack
greenberg
230,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
greenberg
to
which
the
states
--
to
which
the
solicitor
say,
if
the
defendant
takes
the
stand,
i
insist
that
he
be
subject
to
cross-examination
on
any
and
every
item
that
is
in
evidence.
i
am
not
willing
to
make
any
agreement
of
limitation.
and
the
court
asked
a
question
as
to
the
purpose
of
the
offer
and
the
court
then
said,
"i
sustain
the
state
if
the
state
is
not
willing
to
reach
a
stipulation
or
agreement
on
that.but
insist
that
you
open
defendant
for
cross-examination
of
any
and
every
nature,
i
overrule
the
motion."
now,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
on
this
point
held
on
page
350
of
the
record.
if
he
proposed
to
testify
to
facts
showing
that
the
confession
was
unduly
influenced,
he
certainly
ought
to
respond
to
questions
as
to
his
guilt
in
fact
and
to
any
matter
relevant
thereto.
two
judges
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
disagreed
on
this
point.
they
stated
that
i
cannot
agree
with
that
part
of
the
opinion
holding
that
the
defendant
was
not
entitled
to
testify
as
to
the
facts
and
circumstances
concerning
an
alleged
confession
without
thereby
subjecting
himself
to
cross-examination
as
to
matters
pertaining
to
his
guilt
or
innocence,
sanity
or
insanity.
and
there
is
--
therefore,
no
question
as
to
what
the
offer
was
and
to
what
the
ruling
of
the
trial
court
was
and
to
what
the
interpretation
of
it
was
in
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
as
there
has
been
in
some
other
cases
in
which
this
issue
has
arisen
but
has
been
held
not
to
have
been
sufficiently
mature
to
be
decided.
the
alabama
supreme
court
also
pointed
out
that
notwithstanding
a
state
statute
which
relieves
counsel
of
the
necessity
of
informing
the
court
in
detail
of
what
testimony
would
be.
in
addition
to
the
reason
for
this
not
being
error
was
that
counsel
did
not
inform
the
court
in
detail
of
what
the
testimony
would
be.
of
course
there
was
no
doubt
in
the
mind
of
the
solicitor
when
he
objected
as
to
what
its
nature
would
be
and
there
was
no
doubt
in
the
mind
of
the
trial
judge
or
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
and
there
was
no
objection
on
this
ground.
and
in
fact,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
went
on
to
adjudicate
the
merits
of
the
point.
but
petitioner
submits
that
if
this
procedure
should
be
held
to
prevail
that
is
if
when
petitioner
takes
the
stand
to
testify
as
to
the
admissibility
and
i
emphasize
admissibility
as
distinguished
from
--
in
another
portion
of
the
case
as
to
perhaps
the
credibility
of
the
confession.
the
petitioner
takes
the
stand
to
testify
as
to
the
admissibility
of
a
confession.
he
must
then
open
himself
up
to
as
the
supreme
court
said,
as
to
his
questions,
as
to
his
guilt
in
fact
or
as
the
concurrent
justices
said,
"matters
pertaining
to
his
guilt
or
innocence,
sanity
or
insanity."
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
your
honor,
the
usual
practice
is
to
take
it
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury.
in
this
case,
it
was
in
--
and
it's
an
acceptable
practice
in
alabama.
in
this
case,
it
was
taken
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
and
that
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
that
takes
a
little
explanation.
there
was
an
objection
to
the
presence
of
the
jury.
at
that
point,
the
judge
called
a
recess
and
asked
the
jury
to
leave
and
there
was
a
conference
between
counsel
and
the
court.
then
the
conference
--
recess
ended,
and
the
jury
came
back
in
and
there
is
no
further
discussion
as
to
why
or
how
or
for
what
reason
the
jury
came
back
in
at
that
point.
however,
it's
clear
that
counsel
wanted
the
jury
excluded
because
on
two
subsequent
occasions
during
the
trial,
not
at
this
point
but
during
testimony
of
other
witnesses
on
the
voir
dire
or
the
preliminary
hearing.
there
was
motion
for
the
jury
to
be
excluded
and
the
jury
was
not
excluded,
an
objection
was
taken
thereto.
but
it's
petitioner's
position
in
this
case
that
as
to
this
point,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
jury
was
in
or
the
jury
was
out.
because
if
the
jury's
in
as
it
was
here,
it's,
of
course,
highly
prejudicial
for
them
to
get
this
evidence
as
to
his
guilt
or
innocence
when
he's
taken
the
stand
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
himself
from
the
introduction
in
evidence
of
--
the
only
evidence
that
could
convict
him
and
it
was
unconstitutionally
obtained.
but
even
if
the
jury
were
out,
then
the
state
could
obtain
evidence
from
petitioner's
lips
at
that
point
which
it
could
introduce
later
in
its
case.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
don't
know
that
there's
a
ruling
in
alabama
that
talks
about
it
as
of
right.
but
the
alabama
case
that
i
have
read
occasionally
refer
to
the
fact
that
the
jury
was
out
and
i'm
familiar
with
at
least
one
other
alabama
case
since
the
jury
was
out.
it's
the
--
petitioner
submits
that
if
this
practice
were
permitted
to
--
were
--
were
upheld,
then
especially
in
this
case
where
there's
no
other
evidence
against
the
petitioner,
he
is
trapped
into
having
to
take
the
stand
to
keep
out
of
evidence.
the
only
thing
that
can
convict
him,
that
was
unconstitutionally
obtained,
then
by
this,
the
state
can
obtain
the
only
evidence
which
--
by
which
they
can
later
convict
him
and
even
if
the
confession
is
admitted
into
evidence
and
later,
the
court
would
hold
that
it
were
erroneously
admitted
into
evidence.
under
the
ruling
of
stein
versus
new
york,
the
state
could
then
come
here
and
say
that
sure
there
was
an
illegal
confession
admitted
into
evidence
but
we
have
other
evidence
whereby
we
can
convict
him,
and
consequently,
the
decision
below
should
not
be
reversed.
a
number
of
state
courts
have
considered
this
question.
it
hasn't
been
canvassed
through
any
tremendous
extent,
but
it
has
been
considered
by
a
number
of
state
courts
and
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
has
expressed
itself
most
clearly
on
it
and
the
--
the
reason
for
the
rule
on
--
quoted
on
page
17
of
our
brief.
louisiana
has
held
that
it
would
be
a
simple
matter
for
an
unconscionable
person
to
extort
from
the
accused
while
alone,
a
confession.
and
thereafter
falsely
testify
that
it
was
given
freely
and
voluntarily,
whereupon
the
accused
would
be
compelled
to
take
the
stand
to
contradict
the
witness
thereby
subjecting
himself
to
cross-examination
on
the
whole
case.
or
he
would
have
to
let
the
extorted
confession
go
unchallenged.
either
of
these
alternatives
would
do
violence,
at
least
the
spirit
of
the
louisiana
constitution.and
petitioner
submits
that
that
is
the
consideration
that
should
govern
here.
now
there
are
some
cases
--
this
case
wheat
against
united
states,
i
believe
in
the
ninth
circuit
cited
by
the
respondent.
but
that
case
really
points
up
petitioner's
contention
in
this
case
because
in
the
wheat
case,
the
petitioner
sought
to
take
the
stand
on
--
after
the
confession
was
admitted
into
evidence.
and
on
the
issue
of
--
to
the
weight
that
should
be
given
to
it.
and
of
course
when
he
takes
the
stand
as
to
a
matter
of
weight
and
credibility,
it
could
be
argued
that
--
then
he's
testifying
as
to
the
merits
of
the
case,
not
in
the
preliminary
hearing
addressed
only
to
the
court.
and
then
he
should
be
subject
to
general
rules
of
cross-examination.
and
then
of
course,
in
stein
versus
new
york
where
the
court
held
that
the
question
was
not
reached
because
it
was
not
sufficiently
definite
as
it
is
here
that
he
would
be
subjected
to
such
general
cross-examination.
in
the
stein
case,
the
respondent's
quotation
from
the
stein
case
in
its
brief
is,
again,
makes
the
very
point
that
we
insist
upon
here.
on
page
22,
the
quotation
from
the
stein
case
was,
"in
trial
of
a
coercion
issue
as
of
every
other
issue
when
the
prosecution
has
made
a
case
to
go
to
the
jury."
it's
not
this
case
because
there
was
no
case
to
go
to
the
jury
until
that
confession
got
into
evidence
in
this
case.
an
accused
must
choose
between
the
disadvantage
from
silence
and
that
from
testifying.
of
course
as
i
said,
it
doesn't
apply
here.
there
is
an
additional
point
in
this
case
and
that
of
the
jury
exclusion
and
i
shall
address
myself
with
--
only
for
a
moment.
in
this
case
until
the
time
of
petitioner's
indictment,
there
had
never
been
any
grow
--
any
grand
jury
in
dallas
county,
alabama.
when
petitioner
was
first
indicted,
there
was
a
motion
to
quash
made
on
that
ground.
and
the
motion
to
quash
was
granted
although
it
is
not
clear
whether
it
was
granted
on
that
ground
or
not
whereupon
the
jury
commissioners
went
about
selecting
a
new
jury
list.
they
--
in
using
this
list
and
in
selecting
this
list,
they
selected
from
among
persons
whom
they
knew
or
from
persons
--
they
asked
persons
whom
they
knew
to
give
them
names.
and
they
also
consulted
a
number
of
what
might
be
called
"impersonal"
sources
such
as
the
telephone
book
and
the
city
directory,
and
i
don't
recall
whether
it
was
the
voting
list
or
the
tax
list
but
it
might
have
been
something
of
that
sort.
but
they
used
this
only
in
a
sense
to
refresh
their
recollection.
they
went
down
and
they
--
they
saw
someone
whom
they
knew
on
the
list
then
they
might
have
put
him
into
the
jury
box.
they
also
made
a
practice
which
is
not
required
by
alabama
law
of
excluding
exempt
persons.
that
is
a
--
like
for
example,
a
lawyer
or
a
doctor
or
a
teacher
or
a
railroad
engineer
might
be
called
for
jury
service
and
under
the
statute,
would
be
given
an
exemption.
he
could
get
out
of
it
if
he
wanted
to,
but
he
was
not
excluded
from
jury
service.
they
also
made
a
practice
of
excluding
exempt
persons.
at
least
so
they
stated
because
the
record
did
show
that
whereas
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
exempt
negroes
in
the
box.
there
was
evidence
of
a
small
but
substantial
number
of
exempt
white
persons
and
--
well,
at
any
rate,
they
ended
up
with
about
the
names
of
about
300
negroes
in
the
box.
now,
that
may
sound
like
a
very
large
number
but
in
view
of
the
fact
that
it
was
300
out
of
in
excess
of
1700,
and
a
view
of
the
fact
that
there
are
more
negroes
than
whites
in
this
particular
county.
the
number
of
negroes
in
the
box
really
was
not
in
excess
of
those
found
in
the
cassell
case,
for
example,
where
1
out
of
12
was
held
to
be
token
representation.
this
case,
that
comes
out
to
be
somewhat
more
than
i
believe
1
out
of
7.
they
attempt
to
justify
the
small
number
of
negroes
on
the
box
--
in
the
box
in
their
brief
by
stating
that
--
page
13
in
their
brief,
that
it
was
also
shown
that
approximately
90%
of
the
criminal
cases
in
the
courts
of
dallas
country
involved
negroes.
of
course
that's
meaningless
because
that
20
negroes
in
dallas
county
can
constitute
90%
of
all
the
crimes.
that
does
not
mean
that
any
substantial
number
of
negroes
in
dallas
county
are
criminals
and
that
a
great
many
of
them
live
in
adultery.
there's
no
evidence
of
a
systematic
application
of
this
standard
to
the
selection
of
jurors.
but
at
any
rate,
the
evidence
to
which
it
refers
indicates
that
a
very
large
number
of
negroes
in
dallas
county
were
married
by
common
law
marriage,
which
as
i
understand
it,
a
perfectly
legal
and
valid
form
of
marriage
in
the
state
of
alabama.
petitioner
submits
that
this
built-in
factor
into
the
jury
selection
system
that
of
selecting
people
whom
you
know
and
the
fact
of
putting
negroes
or
knowing
they're
negroes
for
the
purpose
of
getting
some
negroes
into
the
jury
box
when,
as
in
this
case,
it
turns
out
to
be
under
all
the
circumstance
and
really
a
token,
violates
the
standards
of
this
court
it
set
down
in
a
number
of
cases
and
more
exhaustively
canvassed
in
the
case
of
cassell
versus
texas.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
box
consists
of
72
names
from
which
the
first
18
are
selected
for
the
grand
jury
and
the
remainder
are
selected
for
the
petit
juries.
none
of
the
first
18
were
negro
and
in
fact,
during
past
years
when
there
had
been
a
smaller
number
of
negroes
on
the
--
in
the
box,
six
or
eight
or
a
dozen
or
20
during
years
past,
none
of
the
first
18
names
that
ever
came
out
of
the
hat
were
colored.
name
19
and
beyond
did
contain
some
negroes
in
other
cases
in
the
past
and
did
contain
some
in
this
case,
but
they
were
struck,
so
they
didn't
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
by
both
sides.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
greenberg
it
was
by
agreement,
agreement
by
counsel.
mr.
jack
greenberg
two
things,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
the
jury
selection
system
was
based
upon
selecting
people
whom
the
commissioners
knew
or
people
whom
they
knew.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
and
it
cannot
be
expected
as
was
pointed
out,
i
believe
mr.
justice
reed's
opinion
in
the
cassell
case
that
conditions
being
what
they
are
and
there
was
a
dallas
county
in
texas
and
a
dallas
county
here.
in
dallas
county,
that
a
jury
commissioner
would
have
as
wide
a
representation
of
negroes
in
his
acquaintanceship
as
he
would
have
of
white.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
don't
believe
that
was
the
--
that
was
the
holding
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
but
it
would
be
our
contention
that
the
judgment
should
be
--
the
question
is
at
what
point
should
the
judgment
be
exercised.
you
can
select
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
not
--
not
that
itself,
but
you
see
the
point
at
which
the
judgment
is
exercised
is
the
point
to
which
the
negroes
are
excluded.
if
they
were
selected
by
some
arbitrary
objective
method
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
they
were
about
300,
about
300,
which
is
a
large
absolute
number
but
in
terms
of
the
population
in
the
county
is
really
not
such
a
large
number
at
all.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
it's
not,
your
honor,
no.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
purposeful
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
purposeful
discrimination
was
using
this
method
of
selection
at
the
point
at
which
the
personal
knowledge
was
used,
that's
the
--
personal
knowledge
was
used
at
the
point
of
initial
selection,
not
at
a
--
see,
the
alabama
statute
proscribes
a
perfectly
--
a
good
method
of
selecting
jurors.
it
says
you
shall
place
in
the
box
name
of
every
person
in
the
county
with
the
following
qualifications,
and
these
are
unexceptionable
qualifications.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
was
left
to
judgment.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
i
don't.
no,
i
don't
complain
of
that
as
an
abstract
system.
mr.
jack
greenberg
commissioners,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
if
he
saw
the
name
of
--
someone
suggested
the
name
of
a
negro
to
him
or
if
he
saw
the
name
of
a
negro
in
the
city
directory,
and
the
race
is
placed
after
your
name
in
a
city
directory
as
to
whether
you're
negro
or
white,
he
would
say,
“well,
i
don't
know
him,”
and
therefore,
he
didn't
even
consider
him.
whereas
if
he
saw
a
white
person
whom
he
knew
or
a
negro
whom
he
knew,
he
would
say,
“well,
i
know
him
and
he
has
good
moral
character,"
or
"he
has
bad
moral
character.”
now,
he
did
not
say,
“let's
take
the
name
of
every
white
person
over
21
years
of
age
and
then
--
or
every
person
over
21
years
of
age
and
then
find
out
whether
he
has
good
moral
character
or
not.
we'll
make
some
investigations
no
matter
how
cursory.
if
he
didn't
know
a
negro,
he
didn't
consider
him
any
further
to
find
out
whether
he
had
it
or
not,
and
of
course,
he
can't
be
expected
to
know
many
negroes
under
those
--
under
the
circumstance.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
there
were
--
included
selma
and
the
counties,
there
were
--
i
would
say
in
total
about
13,000
persons
who
contain
prima
facie
evidence
of
jury
service,
at
least
over
21
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
somewhat
in
excess
of
7000.
mr.
jack
greenberg
in
excess
of
7000.
mr.
jack
greenberg
between
250
and
300.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
he
picked
250-300
negroes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
out
of
--
out
of
1750.
mr.
jack
greenberg
seven
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
1750
names
were
initially
put
in
the
box.
mr.
jack
greenberg
between
250
and
300
were
colored.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
because
of
that
exclusionary
principle,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
1750.
mr.
jack
greenberg
72.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
there
were
about
four
or
five.
mr.
jack
greenberg
pardon
me?
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
may
be
wrong.
i
thought
there
were
about
four
or
five
in
--
in
them
of
the
72,
and
maybe
more.
mr.
jack
greenberg
you
mean
this
--
the
proportion
of
negroes
in
the
72
was
approximately
the
same
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
there
were
always
some,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
true.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
what
--
that
issue
(inaudible)
anything
else.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
except
--
apparently,
the
counsel
on
both
sides
agree
that
these
few
negroes
who
were
in
the
petit
jury
should
be
(inaudible)
what
the
record
says
on
it,
it
says,
the
judge
will
be
--
recites
this
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
this
is
to
the
petit
jury,
your
honor
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
not
the
grand
jury.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
believe
he
agreed
to
that,
yes,
on
the
petit
jury,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
it
had
been
cut.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
record
--
the
record
indicates
that
--
you
see,
there
had
never
been
a
negro
in
a
grand
jury,
but
there
had
been
always
been
maybe
a
dozen
or
two
dozen
in
this
box
of
about
1500,
and
some
of
them
had
been
--
some
of
them
had
been
pulled
out
of
the
hat
after
number
18.
they
never
came
up
before
number
18
which
would
have
put
them
on
the
grand
jury,
and
they
got
on
to
the
petit
jury.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
they
were
pulled
out
of
--
well,
there
was
a
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
don't
know.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
your
honor,
i'm
complaining
of
it,
but
frankly,
i
have
no
explanation
for
it.
it
--
it
may
have
been
to
me,
entirely
candid
about
it.
there
were
only
maybe
a
dozen
or
so
negroes
in
the
box
of
1700
until
recently,
and
so
it's
not
too
farfetched
to
say
that
such
a
small
number
out
of
well
over
a
thousand
could
always
come
out
after
number
18.
the
experience
of
this
one
case,
if
--
if
this
case
--
this
had
happened
in
a
number
of
occasions
and
we
have
no
evidence
as
to
whether
it's
happened
subsequent
to
the
trial
of
this
case.
this
had
happened
in
a
number
of
occasions.
i
think
that
we
would
quite
probably
complain,
but
i
don't
believe
there
is
sufficient
experience
at
this
point
to
raise
a
suspicion
in
my
mind,
surely.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no.
no,
not
as
such.
it's
a
--
i
think
it's
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
--
i
don't
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
i
--
no,
it's
the
method
of
selection.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
it's
--
it's
--
i
would
say
it's
this
built-in
factor
in
the
jury
system
that
if
they
don't
know
a
negro,
they
don't
consider
whether
he
has
good
moral
character
or
not.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
it
wouldn't,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
probability
might
explain
it
when
you
had
maybe
six
or
eight
negroes
in
the
box.
i
don't
think
probability
explains
it
when
you
have
300
though
probability
might
explain
it
on
one
experience.
if
this
was
a
third
case
after
the
system
and
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
it
isn't.
this
is
the
first
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i'll
be
frank
with
your
honor,
i
have
attempted
to
obtain
evidence
of
what
the
experience
has
been
subsequent
to
this
case
and
i
have
been
unable
to
obtain
it.
mr.
jack
greenberg
as
to
that.
that's
right.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
there
are,
your
honor,
and
the
statute
is
in
the
respondent's
brief.
it's
--
i
would
say
probably
a
typical
type
of
statute.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
the
state
refers
--
may
have
brought
it
down
to
that
small
number
you
mean?
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
state
would
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
mr.
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
it
is.
the
state
makes
a
point
in
explaining
this
that
many
negroes
lived
in
adultery
and
90%
of
the
crimes
were
committed
by
negroes
but
i
submit
that's
not
a
sufficient
explanation
because
even
though
90%
of
the
crimes
were
submitted
by
negroes,
this
could
be
five
negroes
who
were
committing
this
90%
of
the
crimes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
that's
their
explanation
of
it
in
this
--
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
believe
there
is
this
sort
of
a
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
there
is
an
education
qualification
but
there's
also
another
provision
for
waiving
it
in
some
cases,
i
think.
i
should
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
jack
greenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
as
to
the
question
of
the
request
to
exclude
the
jury
from
the
courtroom
during
the
preliminary
hearing
on
admissibility,
there
was
the
request
on
page
190,
which
was
followed
by
a
recess
and
the
jury
came
in
with
no
elucidation
of
that.
but
to
make
clear
that
it
was
petitioner's
obvious,
quite
clear
desire
to
have
the
jury
out
during
this
on
page
254
of
the
record
as
the
voir
dire
proceeds
there's
another
demand
that
the
jury
be
excluded,
and
to
the
middle
of
the
page,
the
court
overrules
it.
and
then
during
another
witness
on
page
312
of
the
record,
there
was
another
demand
that
the
jury
be
excluded
and
that
was
denied
and
overruled.
well,
it's
petitioner's
position
that
whether
the
jury
was
in
or
the
jury
was
out,
makes
no
difference
in
this
aspect
of
the
case
because
when
the
jury
was
in,
it's
clear
that
there
would
be
prejudice
and
that
the
jury
could
hear
from
the
petitioner's
own
lips
facts
that
he
would
otherwise
be
privileged
to
be
silent
about.
but
even
if
the
jury
were
out
and
the
state
could
obtain
from
the
petitioner's
own
lips
evidence
that
it
could
introduce
later
in
the
trial
and
the
--
just
the
same
amount
of
harm
could
be
--
would
be
done
under
the
circumstance.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
your
honor,
of
course
i
don't
believe
this
case
calls
for
the
decision
of
that
question.
i
don't
believe
that
that
has
been
so
held.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
it's
been
held
you
can
come
don't
even
take
the
stand,
but
i
--
i
don't
believe
that
it
has
been
--
the
other
has
been
held
nor
do
i
believe
that
any
state
has
so
denied
that.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
well,
the
comment
on
failure
to
testify
of
course
that
this
court
has
ruled
upon
and
has
also
noted
that
this
is
something
the
jury
would
almost
naturally
consider
anyway.
that's
quite
different
than
holding
over
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
wouldn't
think
so.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
greenberg
and
it
is
not
tied
up
with
the
constitutional
right.
that's
how
i
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
greenberg
because
the
question
of
the
admissibility
of
the
confession
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
has
been
obtained
in
violation
of
the
united
states
constitution.
if
there
was
such
a
question
tied
up
with
the
admissibility
of
the
gun,
my
answer
would
be
the
same.
admittedly,
in
some
cases,
there
might
be
a
line
to
draw
but
i
don't
believe
this
case
calls
for
the
drawing
of
such
a
line,
but
clearly,
where
the
only
way
that
a
constitutional
right
can
be
preserved
is
by
such
testimony
then
its
petition
is
--
contention
that
the
integrity
of
the
whole
constitutional
defense
depends
upon
this
preliminary
determination.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
would
say
that
yes,
your
honor,
because
his
defense
against
being
convicted
by
means
of
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
is
a
--
is
a
cognate
to
related
defense.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
i
would
like
to
stress
that
on
this
confession
point,
again,
there
have
been
many
cases
cited
in
both
briefs
and
in
the
argument
in
terms
of
how
many
hours
this
petitioner
was
interrogated
and
how
many
hours
that
petitioner
was
interrogated.
it's
not
merely
a
quantitative
but
a
qualitative
determination
that
the
court
must
make.
and
i
think
the
key
thing
in
this
case
is
just
who
this
petitioner
is.
now,
there
has
been
some
attempt
to
discredit
the
testimony
of
the
psychiatrist
who
were
on
the
staff
of
the
veteran's
administration
on
the
basis
that
they
didn't
examine
him
sufficiently.
and
that
at
any
rate,
the
jury
found
he
was
not
insane
but
the
jury
determination
of
course
though
it
may
indicate
he
was
not
legally
insane,
that
he
did
not
know
the
difference
between
right
and
wrong,
still
does
not
indicate
that
he
was
a
person
capable
of
understanding
his
rights
and
adequately
defending
himself
before
these
police
officers
who
interrogated
him,
at
least
it
must
be
admitted
20
hours
during
this
period
of
time
during
which
a
person
in
such
circumstances
obviously
must
have
been
terrified.
in
fact,
at
the
outset
of
this
case,
the
typewritten
record
indicates
there
was
a
request
for
sanity,
a
lunacy
board
to
be
convened
and
test
his
insanity
and
the
state
denied
this.
there
were
some
questions
as
to
when
he
was
denied
the
right
to
see
the
lawyer
who
came
to
see
him
on
a
saturday
as
to
this
as
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief,
the
warden
testifies,
and
this
is
the
states'
witness,
this
is
the
warden
who
has
possession
of
all
the
records
of
the
prison.
it
was
on
one
saturday
but
i
don't
remember
the
date.
question:"was
that
before
the
confession?"
answer:"yes.
i
believe
it
was.
i
couldn't
say
that
for
sure."
well,
this
is
a
matter
upon
which
the
state
had
--
was
attempting
to
sustain
the
burden.
it
was
--
it
was
its
own
witness
and
it
was
in
possession
of
all
the
facts.
and
i
don't
think
the
state
can
rely
upon
the
possibility
of
a
conflicting
inference
in
its
own
testimony
to
deprive
petitioner
of
something
that's
reasonably
clear
on
the
record.
there
was
another
question
by
the
court
as
to
just
what
kind
of
an
order
this
was
by
which
he
was
transmitted
from
the
local
jail
to
the
state
prison
on
page
201
of
the
record.
it
is
indicated
by
a
police
officer.
i
just
don't
know
he
was
committed
to
kilby
prison
on
an
order
or
request
or
something
of
the
circuit
judge.
that's
what
it
--
apparently
was
administered
of
order
for
some
sort
of
a
transfer.
i
had
earlier
stated
that
the
negroes
on
the
panel,
petit
jury
were
excluded
by
agreement
of
counsel.
i
was
somewhat
in
error
in
that.
counsel
agreed
that
both
sides
had
struck
some
negroes
on
the
petit
jury
panel
but
there
was
no
agreement
of
counsel
to
strike
them.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
gather
they
would.
it
doesn't
indicate
but
on
page
180
of
the
record,
the
court
says
it
is
further
stipulated
by
and
between
counsel
for
the
defendant
and
the
solicitors
that
the
members
of
the
colored
race
who
were
on
the
venire
were
stricken
by
counsel
to
both
sides.
that's
not
an
exact
quote.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
my
answer
to
that
would
be
that
250
sounds
like
a
lot
but
when
looked
at
in
terms
of
the
population
in
the
county,
you
would
--
it
does
come
out
to
something
like
1
in
7
and
in
cassell
1
in
12
was
held
a
token.
mr.
jack
greenberg
we
are
the
--
this
is
quite
a
lengthy
record
and
it's
only
part
of
the
typewritten
record.
there
was
a
tremendous
amount
of
testimony
in
the
qualification
of
jurors
and
i
would
say
that
at
least
50
negroes
were
put
on
the
stand,
graduates
of
brown
university
and
there
were
some
phi
beta
kappas
and
university
presidents
and
doctors
and
dentists
and
so
forth
who
had
never
been
called
for
jury
service.
there
are
a
tremendous
number
of
them
and
i
think
the
--
there
are
citations
to
the
record,
in
the
original
record
in
our
brief.
of
course,
we
couldn't
show
out
of
the
population
of
6000
or
7000
that
--
how
many
hundreds,
but
certainly,
there
was
a
very
substantial
number.
now,
a
partial
answer
to
that
was
that
they
were
exempt
but
exempt
is
not
excluded.
the
exemption
was
for
them
to
claim,
not
for
the
state
to
assume
that
they
would
claim
and
if
they
--
but
there
was
no
evidence
that
they
would
call,
even
given
the
opportunity
to
claim
their
exemption.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
right.
there's
a
distinction
and
there's
certainly
a
substantial
number
of
negroes
there.
i'd
say
20
or
30
or
50.
it
is
the
--
the
record
is
tremendous
on
this
that
were
able
to
serve
but
were
not
called
and
given
the
opportunity
to
claim
an
exemption
if
they
so
desired.
