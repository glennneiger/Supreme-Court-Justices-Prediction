justice

the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
is
the
(inaudible)
i
suppose
you
can
say
that,
what
is
the
exact
basis
on
which
you
then
that
this
constitutes
a
purposeful
discrimination?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
case
ruled
--
is
that
case
ruled
that
it
must
be
by
some
lottery,
some
mechanical
non-pressure
or
lottery.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
that
selection
involving
an
element
of
judgment
does
not
necessarily
violate
the
constitution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
go
into
it,
why
they
have
allowed
you
to
go
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
by
itself
couldn't
be
announced,
and
it
may
not
on
the
basis
of
people
they
know
to
the
jury
commissioner
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
--
you
said
in
one
case,
it
--
out
of
--
how
many
there
was
in
--
what's
the
number?
a
little
while
ago
in
answer
to
justice
harlan.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
you
also
said
they
don't
have
to
--
this
isn't
a
merely
arithmetic
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
where
is
the
--
what
--
in
this
case
was
purposeful
discrimination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
shown
by
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
the
--
whether
or
not
the
qualifications
were
revealed
in
a
particular
potential
juror,
that
was
left
to
the
judgment,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
complain
of
that
as
an
abstract
system.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
if
--
if
the
system
is
all
--
is
not
in
--
in
and
of
itself
discriminatory,
and
then
it
was
drawn
into
place,
again
to
be
applied
of
a
jury
commission,
what's
the
name?
the
official
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
commissioners.
now,
what
is
it
that
he
did
on
which
you
rely
to
establish
a
purposeful
discrimination?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
record
show
how
irrelevant
almost,
nonexistent
in
the
(inaudible)
of
--
how
big
is
this
city
of
selma?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
that
13,000,
how
many
were
negroes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many?
justice
felix
frankfurter
7000.
how
many
in
fact
are
the
--
take
on
the
--
both
the
grand
and
petit
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
those
250
and
300,
did
the
record
show
how
many
was
negroes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
250.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
did
he
put
in
--
how
--
how
many
name
did
he
put
in
the
box
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
altogether
under
which
he
knew
to
the
grand
jury
and
then
the
petit
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
1750,
how
many
were
respectively
going
to
be
colored?
justice
felix
frankfurter
250
were
colored.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
--
what
you
say
is
that
if
he
had
examined
the
people,
the
colored
people
whom
he
didn't
know
or
haven't
informed
himself
on,
there
would
have
been
more
than
that,
is
that
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
not
saying
that
out
of
the
total
from
which
selection
was
made,
there
was
a
disproportionate
number
of
colored,
the
accepted
proportion
because
of
the
exclusionary
principle,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
that
out
of
how
many
were
(inaudible)
the
final
block
out
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no,
the
lot
out
of
which
he
finally
selected
the
grand
and
petit
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
72.
out
of
those,
how
many
were
colored?
justice
felix
frankfurter
four
or
five.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
so
far
as
the
system
goes,
this
is
a
fair
example
of
how
they're
being
operated,
one
in
the
six,
or
one
in
the
ten,
which
is
colored.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
mean,
there
was
--
there
were
negroes
on
the
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
so
it
finally
gets
down
to
the
fact
that
honestly
(inaudible)
so
far
as
the
largest
necessarily
of
--
proportionately
or
(inaudible)
because
there
the
--
wasn't
precluded
by
saying
i
don't
know
and
thereby
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
the
case
get
started.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
18
was
selected
by
way
of
a
lottery.
they
were
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
--
how
did
it
turn
out
to
be
if
they
were
all
white?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
complaining
of
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
you
-
you
can't
(inaudible)
--
but
you
don't
raise
that
point
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
conscious
selection
of
white
out
of
the
group
that
contains
those
whites
and
negroes
for
--
if
there's
a
grand
jury,
you
don't
complain
of
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
complain
that
--
that
with
eyes
wide
open,
they
saw
to
it
that
no
negro
got
on
the
grand
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
you
should
have
just
to
the
fact
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
through
this
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
wouldn't
--
no,
that's
a
different
story.
that
wouldn't
explain
why
18
whites
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yet,
the
law
of
probability
might
explain
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
haven't
--
you
haven't
thought
a
recurrence
of
inexplicable
phenomena
always
going
the
same
way.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
i
understand.
therefore,
what
that
means
to
me
you
can't
--
therefore,
there
is
no
purposeful
discrimination
observed
from
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
hour
of
the
morning?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
getting
the
rule,
to
segregate
the
environment
in
which
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
long
was
that
questioning
period
according
to
your
accounting?
justice
felix
frankfurter
including
this
ride
around?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
this
--
but
the
drive
--
did
the
driver
have
any
--
had
any
particular
objective,
visit
the
houses
where
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
or
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
suggestion
of
an
inflamed
public
opinion
to
the
press
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
sunday
and
monday
and
the
day
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
kilby,
that
was
not
related
to
any.
justice
felix
frankfurter
up
to
this
time
when
he
was
taken,
had
he
been
charged
with
anything?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
before
he
was
taken.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
attorney
general.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
heard
you
say
a
minute
ago
that
when
he
was
taken
to
kilby
prison,
he
was
taken
there
by
--
on
the
basis
of
an
order
of
a
circuit
judge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
there
is
some
judicial
act,
who
--
who
was
the
circuit
judge
who
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
somebody
must
have
asked
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you've
been
(inaudible)
the
circumstance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
somebody
must
have
asked
the
judge
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
we've
got
this
fellow
and
for
these
and
these
reasons,
do
you
think
he
ought
to
be
taken
to
prison?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
there
was
some
kind
of
judicial
--
there
was
some
kind
of
judicial
intervention
at
that
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
that
was
an
arraignment.
but
there
was
some
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
some
judicial
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
i
infer
that
the
police
couldn't
do
this
on
their
own
say
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
used
the
word
--
you
said
"they"
throughout,
could
you
indicate
whether
how
many
constituted
“they”
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
relayed
the
questioning?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
wasn't
the
case,
it's
the
insertion
of
--
interrogated
until
themselves
got
tired
but
continued
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
sweat
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
clear
in
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
(voice
overlap)
--
i
mean,
was
he
present
at
--
in
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
insanity
made
a
defense?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
verdict
of
course
went
to
that
defendant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
there
a
finding
of
any
kind?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
find
--
what
did
the
jury
do
(inaudible)
by
insanity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
if
--
if
insanity
is
found
then
he's
not
guilty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
of
an
insane
mind
couldn't
have
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
both
insanity
--
suppose
insanity
supervening
the
claim
that
insanity
is
subsequent
to
the
commission
of
the
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
by
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
(voice
overlap)
the
jury
verdict
impliedly
rejected
the
defense
of
insanity
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
it
didn't
say
not
guilty
because
of
insanity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
cross-examination,
(inaudible)
witnesses
on
that
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
noticed
the
trial
began
on
the
30th,
is
that
right,
november
30th,
on
page
25,
and
by
that
time
he
had
two
lawyers,
he
had
counsel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
--
he
already
first
had
acquired
counsel?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
maintained
counsel,
are
they
not?
they're
not
court
assigned
counsel
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
to
(inaudible)
a
trial
as
quickly
as
this
(inaudible)
a
case
like
this
in
alabama?
i
need
to
commend
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
--
the
twelfth
of
--
given
the
12,
the
indictment
required
another
12th.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
shortly
after
the
alleged
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
anyhow,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
of
the
indictment?
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
be
sure
that
i
got
it
right.
this
voir
--
this
question
was
put
in
(inaudible)
admissibility
preceding
that
action
outside
the
hearing
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
within
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
this
came
up
or
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
right
after
it
was
heard,
the
judge
ruled
on
admissibility?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
maybe
a
little
(inaudible)
when
the
jury
was
sent
out,
had
the
--
had
the
preliminary
--
had
there
been
preliminary
testimony
on
admissibility?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
was
that
in
the
presence
of
the
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
something
happened,
you
don't
know
what
--
we
don't
know
what
--
the
jury
was
sent
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
10
minutes,
so
this
was
a
short
intermission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
testimony
involved
had
been
in
the
pertinent
--
in
the
jury's
hearing
and
the
testimony
following
had
been
in
the
jury's
hearing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
they
offered
of
the
defendant
to
take
the
stand
for
--
for
limited
purpose
of
controverting
some
of
the
testimony
on
the
admissibility
would
presumably
have
been
in
the
jury's
hearing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
presumably,
testimony
has
been
allowed
to
be
made
could
have
been
in
the
jury's
hearing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
did
it
say
about
the
raffle?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
that's
quite
so
if
i
may
say
so.
because
it
may
be
incumbent
now
the
petitioner
to
say,
i
would
like
to
have
--
if
this
goes
on
the
preliminary
question
of
admissibility
and
since
if
your
honor
rules
this
was
not
voluntarily
made,
that's
an
end
of
the
matter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
the
judge
rules
the
confession
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
to
jury
on
its
finding
that
it
ought
to
be
in.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
on
this
preliminary
question,
that
was
a
leading
--
is
a
stupid
nor
a
good
way
i
put
to
the
original
in
my
inquiry
as
to
how
this
would
be
and
conducted
because
certainly,
(inaudible)
how
can
the
objective
to
have
this
ruling
restricted
if
it's
heard
before
the
judge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
would
be
good
enough
having
an
answer
to
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
question
apparently
explore
you
or
looked
into
your
direction.
are
there
any
rulings
on
these
particular
question
that
are
against
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
to
know
about
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
is
that
it?
isn't
that
your
review?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
mean
by
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
state
--
the
state
may
completely
deny
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
without
violating
the
proper
clause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
been
held
that
he
could
come
without
him
taking
--
taking
the
stand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
heard
you
to
say
that
it
has
been
held
that
you
can
compel
him
--
to
put
him
on
the
witness
stand
and
(inaudible)
the
jury
may
take
it
to
account
that
an
innocent
man
who'd
rather
keep
quiet
has
been
held?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
if
that
has
been
held,
we
held
the
contrary
because
we
have
this
area
not
to
charge
him.
they
--
they
must
now
take
that
into
account
on
the
assumption
that
juries
will
obey
the
(inaudible)
so
we
haven't
held
the
contrary.
we
held
just
the
opposite.
