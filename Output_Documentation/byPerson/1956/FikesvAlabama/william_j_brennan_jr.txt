only
on
admissibility
taken
in
the
presence
to
the
jury
in
alabama?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
objection
on
the
part
of
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
i
gather
from
what
you
said
that
alabama
practice
does
not
permit
the
defendant
as
of
right
to
insist
upon
the
exclusion
of
the
jury
when
evidence
was
taken
to
--
on
the
question
of
admissibility?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
there
any
minimum
of
qualifications
to
the
jury
service?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
any
--
any
evidence
on
whether
inability
to
qualify
may
have
resulted
in
reducing
the
number,
the
250,
whatever
the
number
you
gave
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
heard
you
have
said
earlier,
didn't
you
that
the
number
of
negroes
in
this
county
is
greater
than
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
the
number
of
whites.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
was
--
i
--
that
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
wasn't
getting
at
the
--
i
gather
that's
a
moral
qualification.
i
was
getting
at
whether
there
was
--
or
any
other
minimum
qualifications.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
attorney
general,
am
i
correct
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
my
impression
that's
there's
no
testimony
supporting
any
version
of
these
events
from
the
part
of
the
defendant,
all
of
the
testimony
is
the
version
of
the
officer,
is
that
correct?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
gather
that
the
reason
there's
no
version
from
the
defendant,
there
was
this
insistence
that
if
he
took
the
stand
to
tell
his
side
of
what
happened
he'd
have
to
expose
himself
to
examination
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
all
of
the
details
of
the
crime
of
which
he
was
charged.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
the
nature
of
things
he
wouldn't
have
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
had
a
witness
present
(inaudible)
of
the
case.
he
was
in
custody
(inaudible)
he
--
in
any
event,
there's
nothing
except
what
the
officer
say
happened
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
tell
us
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
attorney
general,
before
you
get
on
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
after
this
right
to
take
the
stand
to
limited
purpose
of
testifying
on
the
matter
of
admissibility
of
the
question
was
denied,
is
there
any
offer
of
proof
or
what
the
defendant
would
have
testified
to?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
didn't
identify
those
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
allegations,
you
mean,
testimony,
certain
testimony?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
know
whether
if
on
part
of
the
defendant
gets
asked
that
the
judge
excludes
the
jury,
whether
the
practice
is
construed
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
this
case
in
any
event,
there
was
no
request
to
exclude
the
jury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
was?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
had
we
had
a
precedent
for
this
in
this
situation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
it,
dealing
with
either
a
defense
or
the
murder,
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
that
--
is
that
--
that's
--
that's
a
long
standing
rule
of
evidence,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
both
in
civil
and
criminal
clauses
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
which
relates
to
the
right
to
have
the
testimony
of
a
party
when
party
takes
the
stand
on
a
matter
bearing
a
--
going
to
the
merits.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
do
you
know
of
any
authority
for
extending
that
rule
to
what's
involved
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
mean
he
should
have
an
aspect
of
at
least
that
is
a
judge
out
of
the
presence
to
the
jury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
should
think
it
make
a
great
difference.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
credibility,
yes,
but
at
this
point,
we're
only
dealing
with
the
matter
of
admissibility,
aren't
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
--
i
could
understand
the
force
of
your
argument
better
if
we're
limited
to
a
situation
in
which
the
judge
alone
was
hearing
it
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury
in
order
to
have
everything
upon
which
the
basic
determination
of
admissibility
or
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
apparently
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
this
case
anyway
so
far
as
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury
is
concerned
because
the
very
outset
the
judge
decided
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
they're
going
to
take
everything
that
was
to
be
heard
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
i
get
that
then
you
mean
at
least
the
burdens
upon
them
that
they
contend
that
this
disproportion
of
colors
to
white,
and
whites
to
colored.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
not
in
part
the
consequence
at
least
of
the
inability
of
more
colors
to
qualify
within
the
eligibility
standards.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
what
you
mean?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
greenberg,
may
i
ask
this.
suppose
this
was
a
case
involving
a
shooting,
the
state
might
offer
as
in
evidence
of
the
gun
allegedly
used
by
the
accused
to
kill
the
deceased
and
evidence
was
offered
but
this
was
the
gun.
could
the
defendant
be
able
to
take
the
stand
and
insist
on
the
right
delimiting
his
testimony
on
the
question
whether
or
not
the
gun
was
his?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
that's
just
a
bit
of
evidence
that's
offered,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'll
accept
that.
it's
an
offer
in
evidence
and
his
effort
is
to
keep
it
out
of
evidence
on
the
ground
that
there
ought
to
be
a
determination
that
it
doesn't
belong
to
him.
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
the
confession
after
all
is
a
piece
of
state's
evidence,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
it's
not
--
if
the
defendant
can't
resist
in
the
right
to
limit
his
testimony
in
the
hypothetical
case
i
put
to
you
that
it's
not
his
gun,
why
is
he
in
a
different
position
here
as
you
suggest
that
he
ought
to
be
able
to
limit
his
testimony
to
the
question
whether
in
fact
it
was
his
voluntary
confession.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
trying
to
answer
the
attorney
general's
suggestion
that
neither
has
practiced
--
that
it
has
practiced
--
in
any
event.
now,
wait
you
in
this
circumstance
where
this
time
there
were
250
to
300.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
about
this
other
point
then
that
you
had
the
burden
to
show
that
the
disproportion
is
not
the
consequence
of
the
application
of
eligibility
standard.
